1
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,338
Doug?

2
00:04:19,628 --> 00:04:22,051
Honey, are you all right?

3
00:04:24,175 --> 00:04:25,554
You're dreaming.

4
00:04:28,054 --> 00:04:29,934
Was it about Mars?

5
00:04:35,853 --> 00:04:37,441
Is that better?

6
00:04:40,232 --> 00:04:41,821
My poor baby.

7
00:04:42,985 --> 00:04:45,324
This is getting to be an obsession.

8
00:04:53,579 --> 00:04:54,792
Was she there?

9
00:04:56,916 --> 00:04:58,254
Who?

10
00:05:00,378 --> 00:05:03,134
The one you told me about.
The brunette.

11
00:05:04,423 --> 00:05:05,595
Lori.

12
00:05:08,594 --> 00:05:11,555
I can't believe you're jealous of a dream.

13
00:05:12,264 --> 00:05:15,062
- Who is she?
- Nobody.

14
00:05:15,226 --> 00:05:17,356
"Nobody"? What's her name?

15
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:18,858
I don't know.

16
00:05:20,272 --> 00:05:21,944
- Tell me!
- I don't know!

17
00:05:22,108 --> 00:05:24,322
You better tell me!

18
00:05:24,485 --> 00:05:28,239
It's not funny, Doug.
You dream about her every night.

19
00:05:28,322 --> 00:05:30,953
And I'm always back in the morning.

20
00:05:31,075 --> 00:05:32,455
Let me go!

21
00:05:35,079 --> 00:05:37,126
Come on, baby.

22
00:05:37,248 --> 00:05:40,212
You know you're the girl of my dreams.

23
00:05:40,376 --> 00:05:41,964
You mean it?

24
00:05:43,170 --> 00:05:45,009
You know I do.

25
00:05:54,557 --> 00:05:57,396
I'll give you something to dream about.

26
00:06:07,445 --> 00:06:11,198
The chairman defended the attack,
saying that space-based weapons...

27
00:06:11,282 --> 00:06:15,369
...are our only effective defense against the
southern block's numerical superiority.

28
00:06:15,453 --> 00:06:17,792
And more violence last night on Mars...

29
00:06:17,955 --> 00:06:20,291
...where terrorists demanding independence...

30
00:06:20,333 --> 00:06:23,794
...once again halted the extraction of terbinium ore.

31
00:06:28,758 --> 00:06:30,968
Kuato and his so-called freedom brigade...

32
00:06:31,052 --> 00:06:33,015
...claimed credit for this latest bombing,...

33
00:06:33,137 --> 00:06:36,432
...which attempted to reopen
the sealed-off Pyramid Mines.

34
00:06:39,935 --> 00:06:43,397
Mars military restored order
with minimal use of force...

35
00:06:43,481 --> 00:06:47,276
...and all damage to the strategic
facility was repaired within hours.

36
00:06:47,318 --> 00:06:48,739
No cameras!

37
00:06:48,903 --> 00:06:52,990
With one mine already closed,
Mars administrator Vilos Cohaagen...

38
00:06:53,074 --> 00:06:55,159
...vowed that troops would be used if necessary...

39
00:06:55,242 --> 00:06:59,000
...to keep production at full capacity.

40
00:06:59,163 --> 00:07:02,583
No wonder you're having nightmares.
You're always watching the news.

41
00:07:06,879 --> 00:07:09,093
- Lori.
- Doug?

42
00:07:09,215 --> 00:07:12,513
- Let's do it.
- Do what?

43
00:07:12,677 --> 00:07:14,015
Move to Mars.

44
00:07:15,179 --> 00:07:18,599
Honey, why do you have to spoil
a perfectly wonderful morning?

45
00:07:20,267 --> 00:07:21,606
Just think about it.

46
00:07:24,063 --> 00:07:27,441
Sweetheart, we've been through this a million times.
You'd hate it on Mars.

47
00:07:27,525 --> 00:07:30,281
It's dry, it's ugly, it's boring.

48
00:07:31,404 --> 00:07:35,533
I mean, really,
a revolution could break out there any second.

49
00:07:35,616 --> 00:07:37,935
Cohaagen says it's just a few extremists.

50
00:07:38,786 --> 00:07:40,124
You believe him?

51
00:07:46,210 --> 00:07:48,424
Okay. Forget about it.

52
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:55,886
Absolutely not. Mars was colonized by
the northern block at enormous expense.

53
00:07:55,970 --> 00:07:59,682
Our entire war effort depends on their turbinium...

54
00:07:59,724 --> 00:08:01,684
...and it's ridiculous to think we're going to give it away...

55
00:08:01,726 --> 00:08:04,353
...just because a bunch of lazy
mutants think they own the planet.

56
00:08:06,022 --> 00:08:09,063
- Maybe we should take a trip.
- Any comment sir on the rumor...

57
00:08:09,066 --> 00:08:11,986
- Lori, move. Please.  - ...that you've closed
the Pyramid Mine because you found...

58
00:08:12,069 --> 00:08:13,988
...alien artifacts inside?

59
00:08:14,071 --> 00:08:16,994
There's a lot better places than Mars.

60
00:08:17,116 --> 00:08:20,077
What about Saturn?
Don't you wanna see Saturn?

61
00:08:20,119 --> 00:08:24,123
I wish we could find some artifacts.
Our tourist industry could use a boost.

62
00:08:24,206 --> 00:08:26,671
Everybody says that its gorgeous.

63
00:08:26,834 --> 00:08:30,346
The fact is, it's Mr. Kuato and his
terrorists who spread these rumors...

64
00:08:30,349 --> 00:08:32,335
...to undermine trust in the government.

65
00:08:32,338 --> 00:08:37,027
We could take of those long space cruise,
the kind with nothing to do.

66
00:08:37,030 --> 00:08:40,181
- Have you found Kuato yet?
- We don't even know what he looks like.

67
00:08:40,264 --> 00:08:42,611
- What do you say?
- That's it for the news.

68
00:08:42,613 --> 00:08:44,313
- Stay tuned for Christine and the weather.
- I'm late.

69
00:08:44,435 --> 00:08:45,940
But first, this.

70
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:50,399
- Tonight on ESPN, the fifth game of the World Series...
- Sweetheart.

71
00:08:50,483 --> 00:08:52,821
- ...live from Tokyo.
- Doug.

72
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:58,699
I know it's hard being in a new town,
but let's give it a chance, okay?

73
00:09:00,618 --> 00:09:05,623
Lori don't you understand?
I feel like I was meant for something more than this.

74
00:09:06,499 --> 00:09:10,461
I want to do something with my life,
I want to be somebody.

75
00:09:10,503 --> 00:09:12,425
You are somebody.

76
00:09:12,588 --> 00:09:14,635
You're the man I love.

77
00:09:19,303 --> 00:09:20,683
Bye.

78
00:09:23,307 --> 00:09:25,146
Have a nice day.

79
00:09:44,036 --> 00:09:46,959
You are now entering a safety zone.

80
00:09:47,123 --> 00:09:51,502
No unauthorized weapons allowed beyond this point.

81
00:10:01,887 --> 00:10:04,769
Would you like to ski...

82
00:10:04,932 --> 00:10:07,313
...but you're snowed under with work?

83
00:10:07,435 --> 00:10:11,480
Do you dream of a vacation
at the bottom of the ocean...

84
00:10:11,564 --> 00:10:13,402
...but you can't float the bill?

85
00:10:14,358 --> 00:10:17,820
Have you always wanted
to climb the mountains of Mars...

86
00:10:19,363 --> 00:10:21,369
...but now you're over the hill?

87
00:10:22,783 --> 00:10:24,622
Then come to Rekall Incorporated...

88
00:10:24,744 --> 00:10:27,830
where you can buy the memory
of your ideal vacation...

89
00:10:27,913 --> 00:10:30,541
...cheaper, safer and better than the real thing.

90
00:10:30,624 --> 00:10:33,297
So don't let life pass you by.

91
00:10:33,461 --> 00:10:37,048
Call Rekall for the memory of a lifetime.

92
00:10:37,131 --> 00:10:40,972
For the memory of a lifetime

93
00:10:41,093 --> 00:10:44,433
Rekall, Rekall, Rekall

94
00:11:03,324 --> 00:11:04,328
Harry.

95
00:11:07,828 --> 00:11:10,226
- You ever hear of Rekall?
- Rekall?

96
00:11:10,247 --> 00:11:12,228
You know, where they sell those fake memories.

97
00:11:12,291 --> 00:11:13,671
Oh, Rekall.

98
00:11:16,462 --> 00:11:18,727
- You thinking of going there?
- I don't know. Maybe.

99
00:11:18,731 --> 00:11:20,511
- Well, don't.
- Why not?

100
00:11:20,633 --> 00:11:25,179
A friend of mine tried one of their "special offers"...
Nearly got himself lobotomized.

101
00:11:25,846 --> 00:11:27,018
No shit?

102
00:11:27,181 --> 00:11:30,234
Don't fuck with your brain, pal.
It ain't worth it.

103
00:11:31,769 --> 00:11:33,608
I guess not.

104
00:12:18,024 --> 00:12:20,363
Good afternoon.
Welcome to Rekall.

105
00:12:20,484 --> 00:12:22,731
Douglas Quaid.
I have an appointment.

106
00:12:26,032 --> 00:12:27,411
- Bob?
- Yeah?

107
00:12:27,575 --> 00:12:30,919
- Doug Quaid is here to see you. Okay.
- Yeah. I'll be right out.

108
00:12:31,704 --> 00:12:33,717
That'll be just one minute, Mr. Quaid.

109
00:12:34,665 --> 00:12:36,045
Thank you.

110
00:12:43,717 --> 00:12:47,603
- Doug...Paul McClane. It's good to see you.
- Nice to meet you.

111
00:12:47,605 --> 00:12:48,933
Come on in. It's through here.

112
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:53,050
- Go and have a seat. Make yourself comfortable.
- Thank you.

113
00:12:53,934 --> 00:12:55,824
Now help me out here, Doug.

114
00:12:55,828 --> 00:12:58,581
- You were interested in a memory of--
- Mars.

115
00:12:59,623 --> 00:13:01,212
Yeah. Mars.

116
00:13:01,375 --> 00:13:02,713
Is there a problem?

117
00:13:04,795 --> 00:13:06,384
To be perfectly honest with you, Doug,...

118
00:13:06,547 --> 00:13:08,010
...if outer space is your thing,...

119
00:13:08,174 --> 00:13:12,720
...I think you'd be much happier with one of
our Saturn cruises. Everybody raves about 'em.

120
00:13:12,803 --> 00:13:15,639
I'm not interested in Saturn.
I said Mars.

121
00:13:16,474 --> 00:13:18,104
Okay. You're the boss.

122
00:13:19,268 --> 00:13:21,232
Mars it is.

123
00:13:22,021 --> 00:13:23,609
Now, let me see.

124
00:13:23,773 --> 00:13:25,736
The basic Mars package...

125
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:29,156
...will run you 899 credits.

126
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:32,782
Now, that's for two full weeks
of memories, complete in every detail.

127
00:13:32,823 --> 00:13:36,327
If you want a longer trip that'll cost
you more because it's a deeper implant.

128
00:13:36,410 --> 00:13:38,749
- What's in the two-week package?
- First of all, Doug,...

129
00:13:38,913 --> 00:13:42,458
...let me tell you, when you go Rekall,
you get nothing but first-class memories.

130
00:13:43,626 --> 00:13:47,630
Private cabin on the shuttle; deluxe suite
at the Hilton; plus all the major sights:

131
00:13:47,713 --> 00:13:49,927
Mount Pyramid, the Grand Canals...

132
00:13:50,091 --> 00:13:52,513
...and, of course, Venusville.

133
00:13:52,676 --> 00:13:54,432
But how real does it seem?

134
00:13:54,553 --> 00:13:59,008
- As real as any memory in your head.
- Come on. Don't bullshit me.

135
00:13:59,009 --> 00:14:01,611
No. I'm telling you, Doug,
your brain will not know the difference.

136
00:14:01,694 --> 00:14:03,858
And that's guaranteed or your money back.

137
00:14:04,021 --> 00:14:07,358
What about the guy you lobotomized?
Did he get a refund?

138
00:14:10,986 --> 00:14:12,950
You're talking ancient history.

139
00:14:13,114 --> 00:14:16,918
Now-a-days traveling with Rekall
is safer than getting on a rocket.

140
00:14:16,921 --> 00:14:19,040
Check out those statistics.

141
00:14:19,203 --> 00:14:22,873
Besides, a real holiday is a pain in the butt.

142
00:14:22,957 --> 00:14:25,546
You got lost luggage, lousy weather...

143
00:14:25,709 --> 00:14:27,590
...crooked taxi drivers.

144
00:14:27,753 --> 00:14:29,884
When you travel with Rekall...

145
00:14:30,047 --> 00:14:32,970
...everything is perfect.

146
00:14:33,134 --> 00:14:34,538
So what do you say?

147
00:14:36,387 --> 00:14:39,143
- All right.
- Smart move.

148
00:14:39,265 --> 00:14:42,521
All right, while you fill out this questionnaire,

149
00:14:42,685 --> 00:14:45,187
I'm gonna familiarize you with some of our options.

150
00:14:45,271 --> 00:14:46,650
No options.

151
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:51,618
Whatever you say.
Can I ask you just one question now.

152
00:14:52,153 --> 00:14:57,416
What is it that is exactly the same
about every single vacation you've ever taken?

153
00:14:58,617 --> 00:14:59,663
I give up.

154
00:14:59,785 --> 00:15:02,500
You. You're the same.

155
00:15:02,621 --> 00:15:05,127
No matter where you go, there you are.
Always the same old you.

156
00:15:06,083 --> 00:15:10,007
Let me suggest that you take
a vacation from yourself.

157
00:15:10,171 --> 00:15:14,776
I know it sounds wild, but it's the latest
thing in travel. We call it "The Ego Trip".

158
00:15:15,509 --> 00:15:16,931
I'm not interested in that.

159
00:15:17,094 --> 00:15:18,808
You're gonna love this, Doug.

160
00:15:18,929 --> 00:15:22,641
We offer you a choice of alternate
identities during your trip.

161
00:15:22,725 --> 00:15:26,270
Face it... Why go to Mars as a tourist
when you can go as...

162
00:15:26,353 --> 00:15:28,150
...a playboy,or a famous jock,...

163
00:15:28,314 --> 00:15:29,318
...or a "Secret agent."

164
00:15:29,482 --> 00:15:31,153
How much is that?

165
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:36,617
Aaah, let me tantalize you.

166
00:15:36,781 --> 00:15:41,577
You are a top operative, back under deep
cover on your most important mission.

167
00:15:41,619 --> 00:15:44,166
People are trying to kill you left and right.

168
00:15:44,288 --> 00:15:47,503
You meet this beautiful, exotic woman.

169
00:15:47,625 --> 00:15:48,671
Go on.

170
00:15:48,834 --> 00:15:51,382
I don't wanna spoil it for you, Doug.

171
00:15:51,545 --> 00:15:53,676
But rest assured, by the time the trip is over,...

172
00:15:53,798 --> 00:15:57,802
...you get the girl, kill the bad guys,
and save the entire planet.

173
00:15:57,885 --> 00:15:59,306
Now, you tell me.

174
00:15:59,470 --> 00:16:02,309
Isn't that worth a measly 300 credits?

175
00:16:16,821 --> 00:16:17,950
It's your first trip?

176
00:16:19,323 --> 00:16:22,284
Well don't worry.
Things hardly ever fuck up around here.

177
00:16:23,494 --> 00:16:25,416
Good evening... Doug.

178
00:16:25,579 --> 00:16:27,877
- I'm Dr. Lull.
- Nice to meet you.

179
00:16:27,998 --> 00:16:31,714
Ernie, patch in matrix 62-B-37,...

180
00:16:31,877 --> 00:16:34,839
...and would you like us to integrate some alien stuff?

181
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:36,761
Sure. Why not?

182
00:16:38,426 --> 00:16:39,764
Two-headed monsters?

183
00:16:39,927 --> 00:16:41,766
Don't you keep up with the news?

184
00:16:41,929 --> 00:16:45,474
- We're doing alien artifacts now.
- It's wild.

185
00:16:45,558 --> 00:16:48,397
Yeah, they date back a million years.

186
00:16:49,770 --> 00:16:51,442
- Ernie?
- That's a new one.

187
00:16:51,564 --> 00:16:53,277
- Blue sky on Mars.
- Been married long?

188
00:16:54,442 --> 00:16:57,022
- Eight years.
- Oh, I see.

189
00:16:57,086 --> 00:16:59,908
Slipping away for a little hanky-panky.

190
00:16:59,912 --> 00:17:02,324
- Not really. I was always fascinated by Mars.
- All systems go.

191
00:17:02,408 --> 00:17:04,246
Number seven.

192
00:17:04,368 --> 00:17:05,748
Ready for dream land?

193
00:17:08,414 --> 00:17:12,543
I'll be asking you some questions, Doug,
as we can fine-tune the Ego program.

194
00:17:12,626 --> 00:17:15,546
You answer honestly,
and you'll enjoy yourself a whole lot more.

195
00:17:15,629 --> 00:17:18,427
- Your sexual orientation.
- Hetero.

196
00:17:23,971 --> 00:17:25,893
And how do you like your women?

197
00:17:26,056 --> 00:17:28,938
Blonde? Brunette? Redhead?

198
00:17:29,852 --> 00:17:31,065
Brunette.

199
00:17:33,397 --> 00:17:37,279
Slim. Athletic. Voluptuous.

200
00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:42,159
Athletic.

201
00:17:46,535 --> 00:17:50,334
Demure. Aggressive. Sleazy.

202
00:17:50,498 --> 00:17:51,961
Be honest.

203
00:17:52,124 --> 00:17:53,462
Sleazy...

204
00:17:57,922 --> 00:17:59,093
...and demure.

205
00:18:01,842 --> 00:18:03,180
41A, Ernie.

206
00:18:05,137 --> 00:18:07,143
Boy, is he gonna have a wild time.

207
00:18:08,265 --> 00:18:11,769
- He's not gonna want to come back.
- That's for sure.

208
00:18:32,998 --> 00:18:36,013
So, what do you say?

209
00:18:36,127 --> 00:18:39,088
I'm not so sure, and I don't get a souvenir.

210
00:18:39,130 --> 00:18:44,552
Not true. For just a few more credits more,
we supply T-shirts, snapshots of you at the sights,...

211
00:18:44,635 --> 00:18:46,474
...and even letters from the--

212
00:18:49,890 --> 00:18:52,021
- What is it?
- You better get down here.

213
00:18:52,184 --> 00:18:54,398
I am with a very important client.

214
00:18:54,562 --> 00:18:56,981
It looks like we got another schizoid embolism.

215
00:18:58,691 --> 00:19:00,237
I'll be right back.

216
00:19:00,401 --> 00:19:03,225
Mr. McClane, Mr. McClane.

217
00:19:03,279 --> 00:19:04,909
Bob! What's wrong?

218
00:19:05,072 --> 00:19:06,911
Don't let her leave!

219
00:19:11,704 --> 00:19:13,417
Get off you!

220
00:19:15,374 --> 00:19:17,046
You blew my cover.

221
00:19:17,209 --> 00:19:20,421
What the fuck is going on here?
You can't install a simple goddamn double implant?

222
00:19:20,504 --> 00:19:22,093
It's not my fault.
We hit a memory cap.

223
00:19:22,214 --> 00:19:24,770
They'll be here any minute!
They'll kill you all!

224
00:19:24,773 --> 00:19:27,264
- What is he talking about?
- Let me go!

225
00:19:27,428 --> 00:19:29,266
Mr. Quaid, try to calm down!

226
00:19:31,849 --> 00:19:33,688
My name is not Quaid.

227
00:19:33,851 --> 00:19:37,688
- Let me go! Untie me now!
- Ernie, grab his leg!

228
00:19:37,772 --> 00:19:40,194
- Hold him down!
- Let me go home!

229
00:20:04,006 --> 00:20:06,178
Are you all right?

230
00:20:06,342 --> 00:20:09,470
Listen to me.
He's been going on and on about Mars.

231
00:20:09,553 --> 00:20:12,473
- He's really been there.
- Use your head, you dumb bitch!

232
00:20:12,556 --> 00:20:15,851
He's just acting out the "Secret Agent"
portion from his Ego Trip!

233
00:20:15,893 --> 00:20:17,773
- I'm afraid that's not possible.
- Why not?

234
00:20:17,895 --> 00:20:19,650
Because we haven't implanted it yet.

235
00:20:23,943 --> 00:20:26,814
Oh shit... Oh shit...

236
00:20:26,821 --> 00:20:30,407
I've been trying to tell you,
someone has erased his memory.

237
00:20:30,491 --> 00:20:31,662
Excuse me.

238
00:20:31,826 --> 00:20:33,497
"Someone"?

239
00:20:33,661 --> 00:20:35,699
We're talking about the fucking Agency.

240
00:20:35,703 --> 00:20:38,294
- Shut up!
- Bob, the client's gone.

241
00:20:40,835 --> 00:20:44,722
Alright! Look. Here is what we're gonna do. Renata,
cover up any memory that he's got of us or Rekall.

242
00:20:44,725 --> 00:20:46,635
I'll do what I can. It's pretty messy in there.

243
00:20:46,799 --> 00:20:50,052
Ernie, dump him in a cab. Around the corner.
Tiffany, you help him.

244
00:20:50,094 --> 00:20:53,097
I'm gonna destroy his file and refund his money.

245
00:20:53,180 --> 00:20:56,517
And if anybody comes asking,
we never even heard of Douglas Quaid.

246
00:21:10,948 --> 00:21:12,286
Where am l?

247
00:21:14,702 --> 00:21:18,240
- You're in a Johnnycab.
- I mean...what am I doing here?

248
00:21:18,372 --> 00:21:21,876
I'm sorry.
Would you please rephrase the question?

249
00:21:21,959 --> 00:21:23,923
How did I get in this taxi?

250
00:21:24,086 --> 00:21:26,550
The door opened, you got in.

251
00:21:29,083 --> 00:21:31,263
Hell of a day, isn't it?

252
00:21:45,024 --> 00:21:46,904
- This okay?
- Right here.

253
00:21:47,026 --> 00:21:49,737
- Thank you for taking Johnnycab.
- Thank you.

254
00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:52,201
Hope you enjoyed the ride.

255
00:21:52,364 --> 00:21:53,744
Hey, Quaid.

256
00:21:54,492 --> 00:21:57,248
- Harry.
- How was your trip to Mars?

257
00:21:57,369 --> 00:22:00,456
- What trip?
- You went to Rekall. Remember?

258
00:22:01,540 --> 00:22:03,671
- I did?
- Yeah, you did.

259
00:22:03,834 --> 00:22:07,296
- I told you not to, but you went anyway.
- What are you, my father?

260
00:22:08,839 --> 00:22:12,093
- Come on, I'll buy you a drink.
- Listen, I'm already late. Thank you very much.

261
00:22:14,011 --> 00:22:16,892
Okay, bring him--
Come on, move it!

262
00:22:17,056 --> 00:22:19,228
Come on, let's go have that drink.
Move it!

263
00:22:19,350 --> 00:22:22,812
What is going on?
What the fuck did I do wrong?

264
00:22:22,895 --> 00:22:25,901
- Tell me!
- You blabbed, Quaid! You blabbed about Mars!

265
00:22:26,023 --> 00:22:29,276
Are you crazy?
I don't even know anything about Mars!

266
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:32,822
You should've listened to me, Quaid.
I was there to keep you out of trouble.

267
00:22:36,033 --> 00:22:39,870
Harry, you're making a big mistake!
You've got me mixed up with somebody else!

268
00:22:39,912 --> 00:22:42,493
Unh-uh, pal.
You've got yourself mixed up with somebody else.

269
00:23:32,715 --> 00:23:35,304
And pivot... and serve...

270
00:23:35,426 --> 00:23:37,848
...and shift... and stroke...

271
00:23:43,309 --> 00:23:45,314
Very good.
Perfect form.

272
00:23:48,939 --> 00:23:50,277
Hi, honey.

273
00:23:52,276 --> 00:23:55,613
- What are you doing?
- Some men just tried to kill me.

274
00:23:55,696 --> 00:23:57,201
Muggers? Are you all right?

275
00:23:57,264 --> 00:23:59,328
No, they were spies or something.

276
00:23:59,450 --> 00:24:02,123
And Harry, from work, he was the--
Get down!

277
00:24:02,286 --> 00:24:06,248
- Harry from work... He was the boss.
- Take it easy, Doug, okay?

278
00:24:06,290 --> 00:24:10,252
- Tell me exactly what happened? Why would
spies want to kill you? - I don't know.

279
00:24:10,294 --> 00:24:13,756
- But it had something to do with Mars.
- Mars? You've never even been to Mars.

280
00:24:13,798 --> 00:24:17,134
I know it sounds crazy, but you see,
I went to this Rekall place after work, and...

281
00:24:17,218 --> 00:24:19,557
- You went to those brain butchers?
- Let me finish.

282
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:23,933
- What did they do to you? Tell me!
- I got a trip to Mars.

283
00:24:23,974 --> 00:24:27,436
Forget about Rekall, will you!
These guys were going to kill me...

284
00:24:27,478 --> 00:24:30,481
- Doug, nobody tried to kill you.
- They did.

285
00:24:30,564 --> 00:24:32,528
But I killed them.

286
00:24:34,485 --> 00:24:39,115
Listen to me, sweetheart.
Those assholes at Rekall have fucked up your mind...

287
00:24:39,198 --> 00:24:41,412
...and you're having paranoid delusions.

288
00:24:41,575 --> 00:24:43,914
You call this a delusion?

289
00:24:52,670 --> 00:24:56,757
- Doug, I'm calling a doctor.
- Don't. Don't call anybody.

290
00:25:25,035 --> 00:25:27,416
Lori, go! Get out!

291
00:26:18,798 --> 00:26:20,177
Why are you doing this, Lori?

292
00:26:37,066 --> 00:26:38,837
Talk! I said talk!

293
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:40,486
- I'm not your wife.
- The hell you're not.

294
00:26:40,569 --> 00:26:42,491
I swear to God!...
I never saw you before six weeks ago!

295
00:26:42,613 --> 00:26:45,161
Our marriage is just a memory implant.

296
00:26:45,164 --> 00:26:48,119
You think I'm stupid?
I remember our wedding.

297
00:26:48,202 --> 00:26:49,540
It was implanted by the Agency.

298
00:26:49,703 --> 00:26:51,208
- And falling in love?
- Implanted.

299
00:26:51,372 --> 00:26:55,251
Our friends, my job, 8 years together,
I suppose all this was implanted too?

300
00:26:55,334 --> 00:26:58,174
The job's real.
But the Agency set it up.

301
00:26:58,295 --> 00:26:59,675
Bullshit.

302
00:27:02,133 --> 00:27:05,052
They erased your identity and implanted a new one.

303
00:27:05,136 --> 00:27:09,348
I was written in as your wife so I could watch you,
make sure the erasure took.

304
00:27:15,187 --> 00:27:16,233
Sorry, Quaid.

305
00:27:16,355 --> 00:27:18,486
Your whole life is just a dream.

306
00:27:21,277 --> 00:27:25,573
Okay, then if I'm not me,
then who the hell am l?

307
00:27:25,656 --> 00:27:26,702
Beats me.

308
00:27:28,117 --> 00:27:29,955
I just work here.

309
00:27:38,244 --> 00:27:40,841
Doug...
There's something I want you to know.

310
00:27:42,506 --> 00:27:46,594
You're the best assignment I ever had.
Really.

311
00:27:46,677 --> 00:27:48,224
I'm honored.

312
00:27:48,345 --> 00:27:52,308
You sure you don't want to,
just for old times' sake?

313
00:27:53,476 --> 00:27:56,604
Come on. If you don't trust me, you can tie me up.

314
00:27:58,481 --> 00:28:02,443
- I didn't know you were so kinky.
- Maybe it's time you found out.

315
00:28:07,698 --> 00:28:08,911
Clever girl.

316
00:28:11,535 --> 00:28:15,456
You wouldn't shoot me, would you Doug?
After all we've been through.

317
00:28:16,540 --> 00:28:18,379
Yeah. Some of it was fun.

318
00:28:21,378 --> 00:28:22,925
Nice knowing you.

319
00:28:57,748 --> 00:28:58,794
Don't touch her.

320
00:28:59,959 --> 00:29:00,963
Nobody here.

321
00:29:02,670 --> 00:29:06,093
- Are you okay?
- I guess I blew it.

322
00:29:06,257 --> 00:29:08,884
- What does he remember?
- Nothing, so far.

323
00:29:08,968 --> 00:29:10,473
I've got him.

324
00:29:24,275 --> 00:29:26,815
Shit, he's going for the subway.
Let's get him. Go!

325
00:29:26,819 --> 00:29:28,699
Let's go. Move it.

326
00:29:42,042 --> 00:29:44,924
Pack your stuff and get outta here.

327
00:29:45,045 --> 00:29:46,884
What if they bring him back?

328
00:29:48,048 --> 00:29:49,387
Not a chance.

329
00:29:58,476 --> 00:29:59,855
The subway....Go!

330
00:30:10,613 --> 00:30:12,910
Get him!
He's got a gun!

331
00:30:13,699 --> 00:30:16,706
- Cut him off! That way!
- Over there!

332
00:30:16,869 --> 00:30:18,082
Hold it!

333
00:30:50,194 --> 00:30:51,198
The escalator.

334
00:30:51,362 --> 00:30:53,701
You four go up.
You come with me.

335
00:31:08,671 --> 00:31:10,259
Get out of the way!

336
00:31:13,050 --> 00:31:14,430
Get out! Move!

337
00:31:45,249 --> 00:31:46,462
The platform!

338
00:31:50,337 --> 00:31:52,176
- Which way?
- Up to the right.

339
00:32:19,366 --> 00:32:23,037
Botco.
Tomorrow's fuels, tomorrow's prices.

340
00:32:23,788 --> 00:32:26,791
Don't settle for pale memories!
Don't gol for fake implants!

341
00:32:26,874 --> 00:32:32,635
Experience space travel the old-fashioned
way on a real-live holiday you can afford.

342
00:32:38,761 --> 00:32:40,599
I want that fucker dead.

343
00:32:40,763 --> 00:32:44,054
I don't blame you man.
I wouldn't want the guy like Quaid porking my old lady.

344
00:32:44,058 --> 00:32:48,979
- You saying she likes it?
- No, I'm sure she hated every minute of it.

345
00:32:49,772 --> 00:32:54,268
Six-beta-nine, Six-beta-nine,
we have a live transmission from Mr. Cohaagen.

346
00:32:55,152 --> 00:32:57,742
Richter here. Patch it through.

347
00:32:57,905 --> 00:33:01,450
- What the fuck is going on down there?
- I'm trying to neutralize a traitor sir.

348
00:33:01,534 --> 00:33:04,241
If I wanted him dead, you moron,
I wouldn't have dumped him on Earth.

349
00:33:04,245 --> 00:33:06,375
We can't let him run around.
He knows too much.

350
00:33:07,998 --> 00:33:09,920
Lori says he can't remember jack shit!

351
00:33:10,084 --> 00:33:12,548
That's now.
In an hour, he could have total recall.

352
00:33:12,711 --> 00:33:17,341
Listen to me, Richter.
I want Quaid delivered alive for re-implantation.

353
00:33:17,425 --> 00:33:18,888
Have you got that?

354
00:33:19,009 --> 00:33:22,016
I want him back in place with Lori.

355
00:33:23,222 --> 00:33:24,602
Did you hear me?

356
00:33:25,724 --> 00:33:28,230
What was that, sir?
I couldn't hear you.

357
00:33:28,394 --> 00:33:30,358
I got Quaid again.

358
00:33:30,521 --> 00:33:33,732
Switching to another channel sir.
I've got sunspots.
I'm

359
00:33:35,693 --> 00:33:37,942
- Call him back!
- I'm losing you.

360
00:33:37,945 --> 00:33:40,743
- Where is he?
- Second level. Galleria.

361
00:33:40,906 --> 00:33:43,204
We should've killed Quaid on Mars.

362
00:34:08,350 --> 00:34:09,814
- How we doing?
- Fine.

363
00:34:12,855 --> 00:34:14,568
Zooming in.

364
00:34:14,732 --> 00:34:15,736
We got him!

365
00:34:36,921 --> 00:34:39,135
If you want to live, don't hang up.

366
00:34:39,256 --> 00:34:41,217
- What do you want?
- They've got you bugged,...

367
00:34:41,258 --> 00:34:45,596
...they'll busting on your door in about
three minutes unless you do exactly what I say.

368
00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:48,599
Don't bother searching.
The bug's in your skull.

369
00:34:51,644 --> 00:34:53,482
- Who are you?
- Never mind.

370
00:34:53,604 --> 00:34:56,649
Wet a towel and wrap it around your head.
That'll muffle the signal.

371
00:34:56,732 --> 00:34:59,652
- How'd you find me?
- I'd advise you to hurry.

372
00:35:02,404 --> 00:35:05,825
This'll buy you some time.
They won't be able to pinpoint you.

373
00:35:14,417 --> 00:35:16,155
- Shit!
- What?

374
00:35:16,168 --> 00:35:18,751
- I lost him!
- Well, find him!

375
00:35:18,754 --> 00:35:20,217
Yeah, right.

376
00:35:20,381 --> 00:35:22,219
Come on. Hurry up.
You look beautiful.

377
00:35:25,261 --> 00:35:28,392
Now go to the window.
Go.

378
00:35:31,434 --> 00:35:33,564
Can you see me down there?

379
00:35:33,686 --> 00:35:36,981
- This is the suitcase you gave me.
- I gave you?

380
00:35:37,022 --> 00:35:40,484
I'm gonna set it here.
Come and get it, keep moving.

381
00:35:40,568 --> 00:35:42,531
- Wait. Wait.
- What?

382
00:35:42,695 --> 00:35:46,240
- Who are you?
- We were buddies in the Agency back on Mars.

383
00:35:46,323 --> 00:35:49,785
You asked me, if you disappeared, to come and find you.
So here I am, good-bye.

384
00:35:49,869 --> 00:35:52,249
What was I doing on Mars?
Damn!

385
00:35:56,709 --> 00:35:58,673
Excuse me, ma'am. But this is mine.

386
00:35:58,836 --> 00:36:01,506
- I don't see your name on it.
- Somebody left it for me.

387
00:36:01,509 --> 00:36:04,845
- You go find your own bag!
- Excuse me, ma'am. But I need it.

388
00:36:06,135 --> 00:36:08,248
Fuck you, you asshole!

389
00:36:17,438 --> 00:36:19,276
That son of a bitch got to be around here somewhere.

390
00:36:23,235 --> 00:36:24,581
That guy there.

391
00:36:34,205 --> 00:36:37,892
Hello, I'm Johnnycab.
Where can I take you tonight?

392
00:36:39,210 --> 00:36:41,124
Drive. Drive!

393
00:36:41,127 --> 00:36:45,182
- Would you please repeat the destination?
- Anywhere! Just go! Go!

394
00:36:45,184 --> 00:36:48,994
- Please state the street and number.
- Shit. Shit!

395
00:36:49,136 --> 00:36:52,948
I'm not familiar with that address.
Would you please repeat--

396
00:37:00,397 --> 00:37:01,944
Please fasten your seat belt.

397
00:37:35,599 --> 00:37:39,580
- The fare is 18 credits, please.
- Sue me, dickhead.

398
00:37:49,113 --> 00:37:51,494
We hope you enjoyed the ride.

399
00:39:26,669 --> 00:39:29,266
Howdy, stranger.
This is Hauser.

400
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:32,566
If things have gone wrong,
I'm talking to myself...

401
00:39:32,550 --> 00:39:35,716
...and you've got a wet towel
wrapped around your head.

402
00:39:35,719 --> 00:39:39,281
Now whatever your name is,
get ready for the big surprise.

403
00:39:40,433 --> 00:39:43,647
You are not you.
You are me.

404
00:39:44,562 --> 00:39:46,317
No shit.

405
00:39:48,315 --> 00:39:50,821
Six-beta-nine, six-beta-nine, come in.

406
00:39:50,985 --> 00:39:52,323
Did you find him?

407
00:39:52,345 --> 00:39:55,506
We picked up an explosion at the old cement factory.

408
00:39:56,282 --> 00:39:58,996
Send two units.
We'll meet them there.

409
00:40:03,456 --> 00:40:06,455
All my life I've worked for Mars Intelligence.

410
00:40:06,459 --> 00:40:08,464
I did Cohaagen's dirty work.

411
00:40:08,627 --> 00:40:11,627
Then a few weeks ago, I met somebody--
a woman.

412
00:40:11,630 --> 00:40:13,469
And I learned a few things;...

413
00:40:13,632 --> 00:40:16,447
...like I've been playing for the wrong team.

414
00:40:17,595 --> 00:40:21,374
All I can do now is try to make up for it.

415
00:40:21,375 --> 00:40:24,932
See there's enough shit in here to fuck Cohaagen good.

416
00:40:24,935 --> 00:40:29,248
Unfortunately, if you're listening to this,
that means that he is got to me first.

417
00:40:29,982 --> 00:40:34,181
And here comes the hard part old buddy.
Now it is all up to you.

418
00:40:34,236 --> 00:40:35,408
Great.

419
00:40:47,208 --> 00:40:49,130
- What have we got?
- He's not here.

420
00:40:49,293 --> 00:40:51,792
- He's gone.
- I got a weak signal over there.

421
00:40:51,796 --> 00:40:53,175
Split up. Find him.

422
00:40:53,339 --> 00:40:56,338
First let's get rid of that bug in your head.

423
00:40:56,342 --> 00:41:00,177
Take this thing out of the case
and stick it up your nose.

424
00:41:00,179 --> 00:41:02,143
Don't worry.
It's self-guiding.

425
00:41:08,187 --> 00:41:10,234
Just shove real hard.

426
00:41:16,195 --> 00:41:17,908
When you hear the crunch, you're there.

427
00:41:19,573 --> 00:41:21,245
Just pull it out.

428
00:41:21,259 --> 00:41:24,048
And be careful.
It's my head, too.

429
00:41:45,641 --> 00:41:47,480
I've got a lock!

430
00:41:47,643 --> 00:41:48,981
Up. Let's go.

431
00:41:51,272 --> 00:41:52,902
Now this is the plan.

432
00:41:53,065 --> 00:41:54,612
Get your ass to Mars.

433
00:41:54,775 --> 00:41:58,234
Then go to the Hilton and flash
the Brubaker I.D. at the desk.

434
00:41:58,237 --> 00:41:59,909
That's all there is to it.

435
00:42:00,072 --> 00:42:06,011
Just do what I tell you,
and we can nail that son of a bitch who fucked you and me.

436
00:42:05,953 --> 00:42:07,958
I'm counting on you, Buddy.

437
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:09,752
Don't let me down.

438
00:42:38,819 --> 00:42:39,824
Straight ahead.

439
00:42:43,908 --> 00:42:45,246
In there.

440
00:42:53,793 --> 00:42:55,172
There!

441
00:43:13,479 --> 00:43:14,576
Give me that.

442
00:43:19,985 --> 00:43:21,032
Shit.

443
00:43:22,530 --> 00:43:25,841
Get your ass to Mars--
Get your ass to Mars--

444
00:43:59,560 --> 00:44:02,398
Welcome to the Mars Federal Colony.

445
00:44:02,402 --> 00:44:07,761
For your safety and comfort, domes have been
installed to protect you from the vacuum outside.

446
00:44:08,075 --> 00:44:11,742
Please do not touch
exterior windows or air locks.

447
00:44:11,746 --> 00:44:16,081
I insist the air volume is limited.
No smoking is allowed anywhere in the colony.

448
00:44:16,083 --> 00:44:17,088
Next.

449
00:44:18,377 --> 00:44:21,384
Thank you, and enjoy your stay on Mars.

450
00:44:21,547 --> 00:44:22,885
Passport.

451
00:44:36,103 --> 00:44:39,943
- Come on. Get out of the way.
- Make way! Stand back.

452
00:44:46,030 --> 00:44:48,757
Mr. Cohaagen wants to see you right away.

453
00:44:49,742 --> 00:44:51,288
Any news of Quaid?

454
00:44:51,410 --> 00:44:54,471
- Not since you lost him.
- Watch your mouth, Captain.

455
00:44:55,539 --> 00:44:59,290
- So how long do you plan to stay on Mars?
- Two weeks.

456
00:44:59,293 --> 00:45:01,424
Look at that shit.

457
00:45:01,587 --> 00:45:05,212
- What the hell's this?
- The Martians all love Kuato.

458
00:45:05,216 --> 00:45:07,464
They think he's fuckin' George Washington.

459
00:45:07,468 --> 00:45:09,140
Kill the bastard.

460
00:45:09,261 --> 00:45:10,975
Nobody knows who he is.

461
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:15,117
Have you brought any fruits or vegetables onto the planet?

462
00:45:15,643 --> 00:45:16,939
Two weeks.

463
00:45:17,853 --> 00:45:18,858
Excuse me?

464
00:45:20,397 --> 00:45:22,236
Two weeks.

465
00:45:29,323 --> 00:45:31,615
It's not just graffiti.

466
00:45:31,617 --> 00:45:34,160
The rebels took over the refinery last night.

467
00:45:34,161 --> 00:45:35,791
No turbinium is going out.

468
00:45:35,955 --> 00:45:37,835
And it gets worse.

469
00:45:58,352 --> 00:45:59,648
Quaid.

470
00:46:00,855 --> 00:46:02,434
- That's Quaid!
- Where?

471
00:46:02,438 --> 00:46:04,595
The woman!
Get him-- her!

472
00:46:05,192 --> 00:46:06,822
Arrest that woman!

473
00:46:06,986 --> 00:46:08,366
Grab her!

474
00:46:38,100 --> 00:46:39,230
Catch!

475
00:46:41,395 --> 00:46:43,567
Get ready for a surprise!

476
00:47:54,468 --> 00:47:56,509
- Open the goddamn door!
- I can't!

477
00:47:56,512 --> 00:47:57,808
Open it!

478
00:47:57,930 --> 00:47:59,602
They're all connected.

479
00:48:09,650 --> 00:48:12,651
Then a few days ago,
Cohaagen raised the price of air.

480
00:48:12,653 --> 00:48:16,070
- Again?
- Nobody on Earth gives a damn what happens up here.

481
00:48:16,073 --> 00:48:19,073
They just want our turbinium
so they can zap things from space.

482
00:48:19,076 --> 00:48:20,956
Excuse me. What's that?

483
00:48:21,120 --> 00:48:23,167
You mean the Pyramid Mine?

484
00:48:23,330 --> 00:48:26,956
I used to work there,
till they found that alien shit inside.

485
00:48:26,959 --> 00:48:29,340
Well, that's a rumor, isn't it?

486
00:48:29,462 --> 00:48:30,883
Think so?

487
00:49:00,451 --> 00:49:01,872
Mr. Cohaagen.

488
00:49:09,210 --> 00:49:11,090
You wanted to see me, sir?

489
00:49:14,757 --> 00:49:19,655
Richter, do you know why I'm such a happy person?

490
00:49:19,720 --> 00:49:21,100
No, sir.

491
00:49:22,815 --> 00:49:26,357
Because I've got the greatest job in the solar system.

492
00:49:26,360 --> 00:49:30,528
As long as the turbinium keeps flowing,
I can do anything I want.

493
00:49:30,531 --> 00:49:31,911
Anything.

494
00:49:33,609 --> 00:49:38,679
If fact, the only thing I ever worry about is that one day,...

495
00:49:38,697 --> 00:49:43,541
...if the rebels win, it all might end.

496
00:49:43,702 --> 00:49:45,207
And you're fucking making it happen!

497
00:49:46,205 --> 00:49:49,248
First you try to kill Quaid,
and then you let him get away.

498
00:49:49,250 --> 00:49:51,464
He had help from our side, sir.

499
00:49:52,753 --> 00:49:53,883
I know that.

500
00:49:56,048 --> 00:49:58,424
- But I thought--
- Who told you to think?

501
00:49:58,426 --> 00:50:01,612
I don't give you enough information to think.

502
00:50:03,055 --> 00:50:06,825
You do what you're told.
That's what you do.

503
00:50:08,894 --> 00:50:10,107
Yes, sir.

504
00:50:15,568 --> 00:50:17,073
Now let's get down to business.

505
00:50:18,863 --> 00:50:21,160
We've got a tricky situation here.

506
00:50:21,282 --> 00:50:23,579
Kuato wants what's in Quaid's head.

507
00:50:24,994 --> 00:50:28,430
And he might be able to get it,
cause they say he's psychic.

508
00:50:29,749 --> 00:50:32,768
And I have a plan to keep this from happening.

509
00:50:36,088 --> 00:50:37,968
Do you think you can play along?

510
00:50:38,090 --> 00:50:40,137
- Yes, sir.
- Great.

511
00:50:40,301 --> 00:50:42,682
Because, otherwise I'll erase your ass.

512
00:51:00,905 --> 00:51:05,114
Taxi! You need a taxi sir?
I got magazines, I got music, I got whisky.

513
00:51:05,117 --> 00:51:07,456
You need a cab man?
Come on!

514
00:51:33,145 --> 00:51:34,525
Good afternoon. Can I help you?

515
00:51:34,647 --> 00:51:37,153
Yes I would like to have a room, please.

516
00:51:42,321 --> 00:51:45,582
Nice to have you back with us, Mr. Brubaker.
Would you like the same suite?

517
00:51:45,586 --> 00:51:46,862
Well. Definitely.

518
00:51:48,994 --> 00:51:51,000
It seems you left something in our safe.

519
00:51:51,163 --> 00:51:52,261
Could you get it please?

520
00:51:58,379 --> 00:51:59,884
Identification?

521
00:52:09,306 --> 00:52:11,825
- I'll go encode your room key.
- Thank you.

522
00:52:28,200 --> 00:52:31,535
- There you go, Mr. Brubaker. Suite 610 in the east wing.
- Thank you.

523
00:52:31,537 --> 00:52:34,139
- Could I borrow your pen, please?
- Certainly.

524
00:52:46,093 --> 00:52:47,264
Thank you.

525
00:52:52,558 --> 00:52:54,980
Hey, man, you need a cab?

526
00:52:55,144 --> 00:52:59,687
- What was wrong with this one?
- He ain't got five kids to feed.

527
00:52:59,690 --> 00:53:02,029
- Where's yours?
- Right over there man.

528
00:53:04,445 --> 00:53:07,118
Hey, asshole!
That's my fare!

529
00:53:07,281 --> 00:53:08,577
Eat this!

530
00:53:08,741 --> 00:53:09,996
Damn you, Benny!

531
00:53:16,248 --> 00:53:18,095
Welcome to Mars, man!

532
00:53:22,088 --> 00:53:25,754
- What the hell was that, an accident?
- That's the rebels man.

533
00:53:25,758 --> 00:53:27,138
Let's get outta here...

534
00:53:27,259 --> 00:53:29,098
...before they arrest us!

535
00:53:29,261 --> 00:53:31,354
What do the rebels want?

536
00:53:31,355 --> 00:53:34,658
All the usual.
More money, more freedom, more air.

537
00:53:39,605 --> 00:53:40,978
So, where to?

538
00:53:40,981 --> 00:53:42,695
The Last Resort.

539
00:53:42,817 --> 00:53:44,780
You're getting off to an early start.

540
00:53:45,778 --> 00:53:47,950
- First time on Mars?
- Yes.

541
00:53:48,114 --> 00:53:49,869
Well, actually, no.

542
00:53:50,032 --> 00:53:51,704
Well, sort of.

543
00:53:51,867 --> 00:53:55,971
Damn! The man don't even know whether
he's been to Mars or not.

544
00:54:06,257 --> 00:54:08,596
Voila. Venusville.

545
00:54:09,969 --> 00:54:12,183
Hey, you see anything you like?

546
00:54:16,308 --> 00:54:19,685
End of the line.
We're going to have to walk from here.

547
00:54:19,687 --> 00:54:21,525
I'll show you where.

548
00:54:21,689 --> 00:54:25,523
- Do you want to know the future?
- What about the past?

549
00:54:25,526 --> 00:54:29,320
Come on. It's around the corner, right down this alley.

550
00:54:29,321 --> 00:54:31,202
They got everything.

551
00:54:33,826 --> 00:54:35,706
Not bad, huh?

552
00:54:37,246 --> 00:54:41,875
Read your palm? Your mind? Read your aura?
Probe the secrets of your heart?

553
00:54:41,876 --> 00:54:44,081
- I bet I can guess your birthday.
- What is it?

554
00:54:44,084 --> 00:54:47,106
- You're a Taurus, right?
- How did you guess?

555
00:54:49,675 --> 00:54:51,989
- Tell me something; are all psychics, uh...?
- Freaks?

556
00:54:52,052 --> 00:54:54,116
Afraid so, man.
It goes with the territory.

557
00:54:54,180 --> 00:54:59,431
- What happened to them?
- Cheap domes. And no air to screen of the rays.

558
00:54:59,435 --> 00:55:03,639
So, there it is. The Last Resort.
You sure you want to go in here man?

559
00:55:03,642 --> 00:55:06,730
- Why not?
- I know this much better place down the street--

560
00:55:06,734 --> 00:55:09,735
The girls are cleaner, the liquor ain't watered down--

561
00:55:09,737 --> 00:55:11,909
Sure, and you get kickback.

562
00:55:12,073 --> 00:55:14,912
Hey, man, I got five kids to feed.

563
00:55:15,076 --> 00:55:16,914
Take them to the dentist.

564
00:55:17,036 --> 00:55:19,758
Hey, Thanks! Mister!
Listen, I'll be waiting here for you.

565
00:55:19,762 --> 00:55:22,919
You just take your time.
Benny's the name. Benny!

566
00:55:41,894 --> 00:55:43,999
- What do you want?
- I'm looking for Melina.

567
00:55:44,063 --> 00:55:45,735
She's busy.

568
00:55:45,898 --> 00:55:47,903
But Mary here, she's free.

569
00:55:48,025 --> 00:55:53,327
Well, Not "free" honey, but available.

570
00:55:56,575 --> 00:55:58,831
Thanks.
I'll wait for Melina.

571
00:55:58,994 --> 00:56:00,166
Earth slime.

572
00:56:00,287 --> 00:56:02,918
Thing is, friend, Mel's real picky.

573
00:56:03,082 --> 00:56:05,129
She kinda sticks to her regulars.

574
00:56:05,292 --> 00:56:07,173
She will like me.

575
00:56:08,379 --> 00:56:09,675
Mel!

576
00:56:47,460 --> 00:56:48,673
Hello Hauser.

577
00:56:49,795 --> 00:56:51,676
Still bulging, I see.

578
00:56:53,215 --> 00:56:56,569
- What you been feeding this thing?
- Blondes.

579
00:56:58,429 --> 00:57:00,267
I think it's still hungry.

580
00:57:02,725 --> 00:57:05,850
You got a lot of nerve showing
your face around here, Hauser.

581
00:57:05,853 --> 00:57:07,817
Look who's talking.

582
00:57:07,980 --> 00:57:10,695
Hey Tony. Give the big guy a break.

583
00:57:10,858 --> 00:57:13,114
Relax. You'll live longer.

584
00:57:13,277 --> 00:57:14,615
Come on.

585
00:57:20,326 --> 00:57:24,034
- Honey, take care of Tony, will you?
- No problem.

586
00:57:24,038 --> 00:57:27,099
If you need any help with this one,
give me a holler.

587
00:57:41,847 --> 00:57:43,853
You son of a bitch.

588
00:57:43,974 --> 00:57:46,902
You're alive?
I thought that Cohaagen tortured you to death.

589
00:57:46,905 --> 00:57:48,641
Well, I guess he didn't.

590
00:57:48,644 --> 00:57:52,741
And you couldn't get me a message?
You never wondered what happened to me?

591
00:58:00,032 --> 00:58:02,246
Hauser, thank God you're alive.

592
00:58:03,452 --> 00:58:06,708
Melin-- Melina.
Melina.

593
00:58:07,790 --> 00:58:10,688
- There's something I have to tell you...
- What?

594
00:58:10,709 --> 00:58:14,418
- I don't remember you.
- What are you talking about?

595
00:58:14,422 --> 00:58:16,469
I don't remember you.

596
00:58:16,632 --> 00:58:20,194
I don't remember us.
I don't even remember me.

597
00:58:22,179 --> 00:58:24,678
What, did you get amnesia?
How did you get here?

598
00:58:24,682 --> 00:58:27,139
- Hauser left me a note.
- Hauser? You're Hauser.

599
00:58:27,143 --> 00:58:28,981
Not anymore.

600
00:58:29,145 --> 00:58:32,193
Now I'm Quaid.
Douglas Quaid.

601
00:58:35,443 --> 00:58:39,568
- Hauser, you've lost your mind.
- I didn't lose my mind. Cohaagen stole it.

602
00:58:39,572 --> 00:58:44,240
He found out that Hauser switched sides,
so he turned him into somebody else: me.

603
00:58:44,243 --> 00:58:45,581
This is too weird.

604
00:58:45,745 --> 00:58:48,412
Then he dumped me on Earth
with a wife and a lousy job and--

605
00:58:48,414 --> 00:58:51,415
Did you say wife?
Are you fucking married?

606
00:58:51,417 --> 00:58:53,499
- I'm sure she wasn't really my wife.
- Oh, she isn't really your wife.

607
00:58:53,502 --> 00:58:56,050
How stupid of me.
She was Hauser's wife?

608
00:58:56,053 --> 00:58:58,964
- Look forget that I said wife.
- No. Let's just forget everything.

609
00:58:58,966 --> 00:59:02,862
- I'm sick of hearing your goddamn lies.
- Why would I lie to you?

610
00:59:03,763 --> 00:59:07,223
Because you're still working for Cohaagen.

611
00:59:07,224 --> 00:59:09,772
Don't be ridiculous.

612
00:59:12,438 --> 00:59:16,760
You never loved me, Hauser.
You just used me to get inside.

613
00:59:16,817 --> 00:59:18,656
Inside what?

614
00:59:22,865 --> 00:59:24,829
I think you'd better leave.

615
00:59:24,992 --> 00:59:28,325
- Melina, Hauser sent me to do something.
- I'm not falling for it.

616
00:59:28,329 --> 00:59:30,578
He said there's enough in here
to nail Cohaagen for good.

617
00:59:30,581 --> 00:59:32,580
- Get out!
- You've got to help me remember!

618
00:59:32,583 --> 00:59:34,630
- I said, get out!
- Melina, please!

619
00:59:34,794 --> 00:59:36,632
People are trying to kill me.

620
00:59:37,588 --> 00:59:39,176
Really?

621
00:59:41,592 --> 00:59:43,797
All right, I'm leaving.

622
00:59:55,689 --> 00:59:58,691
Baby, you make me wish I had three hands.

623
00:59:58,692 --> 01:00:01,365
Well I think you're doing just fine with two.

624
01:00:01,487 --> 01:00:03,986
Excuse me, baby.
We'll pick this up later.

625
01:00:03,989 --> 01:00:06,329
Hey, that didn't take long.

626
01:00:06,492 --> 01:00:09,158
Listen! Let me ask you a question.
Did you ever fuck a mutant?

627
01:00:09,161 --> 01:00:11,662
- Take me to the hotel.
- I know these Siamese twins.

628
01:00:11,664 --> 01:00:14,391
Man, you don't know if you're coming or going.

629
01:00:24,051 --> 01:00:30,143
This afternoon at 4:30 p.m., I signed an order
declaring martial law throughout the Mars federal colony.

630
01:00:30,307 --> 01:00:34,975
I will not tolerate any further damage
to our mineral export operations.

631
01:00:34,979 --> 01:00:38,748
Mr. Kuato and his terrorists must
understand that their self-defeating efforts...

632
01:00:38,749 --> 01:00:40,849
...will only bring misery and suffering to the people--

633
01:00:44,280 --> 01:00:45,451
Mr. Quaid?

634
01:00:46,282 --> 01:00:47,453
What?

635
01:00:47,616 --> 01:00:49,872
I need to talk to you about Mr. Hauser.

636
01:00:51,162 --> 01:00:53,537
- Who are you?
- Dr. Edgemar from Rekall.

637
01:00:53,539 --> 01:00:55,955
- How did you find me?
- It's a little difficult to explain.

638
01:00:55,958 --> 01:00:58,856
Could you open the door, please?
I'm not armed.

639
01:01:00,546 --> 01:01:03,469
Don't worry. I'm alone.
May I come in?

640
01:01:05,551 --> 01:01:08,968
- What do you want?   - This is going to be
very difficult for you at accept, Mr. Quaid.

641
01:01:08,971 --> 01:01:12,575
- I'm listening.
- I'm afraid you're not really standing here right now.

642
01:01:14,143 --> 01:01:17,394
- Ya know, Doc, you could have fooled me.
- I'm quite serious.

643
01:01:17,396 --> 01:01:20,653
You're not here and neither am I.

644
01:01:20,816 --> 01:01:21,988
That's amazing.

645
01:01:22,151 --> 01:01:25,157
- Where are we?
- At Rekall.

646
01:01:25,321 --> 01:01:30,359
You're strapped into an implant chair and
I'm monitoring you at from the psychoprobe console.

647
01:01:31,285 --> 01:01:33,791
Ah, I get it.
I'm dreaming.

648
01:01:33,913 --> 01:01:37,371
And this is all part of that delightful
vacation your company has sold me.

649
01:01:37,374 --> 01:01:38,713
Not exactly.

650
01:01:38,876 --> 01:01:43,085
What you're experiencing is a free-form
delusion based on our memory tapes.

651
01:01:43,089 --> 01:01:45,774
But you're inventing it yourself as you go along.

652
01:01:47,051 --> 01:01:50,594
Well, if this is my delusion,
who the hell invited you?

653
01:01:50,596 --> 01:01:54,598
I've been artificially implanted
as an emergency measure.

654
01:01:54,600 --> 01:01:58,017
I'm sorry to tell you this, Mr. Quaid,
but you've suffered a schizoid embolism.

655
01:01:58,020 --> 01:02:00,317
We can't snap you out of your fantasy...

656
01:02:00,439 --> 01:02:03,606
...and I've been sent in to try to talk you down.

657
01:02:03,609 --> 01:02:05,828
How much is Cohaagen paying you for this?

658
01:02:06,987 --> 01:02:11,197
Think about it. Your dream started
in the middle of the implant procedure.

659
01:02:11,200 --> 01:02:13,699
Everything after that--
the chases, the trip to Mars...

660
01:02:13,702 --> 01:02:18,287
...your suite here at the Hilton--these are all
elements of your Rekall Holiday and Ego Trip:

661
01:02:18,290 --> 01:02:20,629
You paid to be a secret agent.

662
01:02:20,793 --> 01:02:23,174
Bullshit. It's coincidence.

663
01:02:23,337 --> 01:02:25,843
And what about the girl?

664
01:02:25,965 --> 01:02:28,679
Brunette, athletic, sleazy and demure?

665
01:02:28,843 --> 01:02:31,467
Just like you specified.
Is that a coincidence?

666
01:02:31,470 --> 01:02:35,139
She's real.
I dreamed about her before I even went to Rekall.

667
01:02:35,141 --> 01:02:37,146
Mr. Quaid.

668
01:02:37,309 --> 01:02:41,435
Can you hear yourself?
She's real because you dreamed her?

669
01:02:41,439 --> 01:02:44,522
- That's right.
- Maybe this will convince you.

670
01:02:44,525 --> 01:02:46,906
Would you mind opening the door?

671
01:02:48,946 --> 01:02:51,243
- You open it.
- No need to be rude.

672
01:02:51,407 --> 01:02:53,162
I'll do it.

673
01:02:59,832 --> 01:03:01,003
Sweetheart?

674
01:03:03,669 --> 01:03:05,633
Come in, Mrs. Quaid.

675
01:03:09,884 --> 01:03:15,645
- What I suppose you're not here either?
- I'm here at Rekall.

676
01:03:19,351 --> 01:03:20,940
I love you.

677
01:03:21,103 --> 01:03:24,402
Right.
That's why you tried to kill me.

678
01:03:24,523 --> 01:03:28,489
No. I'd never do anything to hurt you.

679
01:03:28,652 --> 01:03:30,908
I want you to come back to me.

680
01:03:33,115 --> 01:03:36,448
- Bullshit.
- What's bullshit, Mr. Quaid?

681
01:03:36,452 --> 01:03:41,120
That you're having a paranoid episode
triggered by acute neuro-chemical trauma?

682
01:03:41,123 --> 01:03:45,166
Or that you're really an
invincible secret agent from Mars...

683
01:03:45,169 --> 01:03:51,161
...who's the victim of an interplanetary conspiracy
to make him think he's a lowly construction worker?

684
01:03:59,016 --> 01:04:01,272
Stop punishing yourself, Doug.

685
01:04:01,393 --> 01:04:04,455
You're a fine, upstanding man.
You have a beautiful wife that loves you.

686
01:04:05,898 --> 01:04:07,778
Your whole life is ahead of you.

687
01:04:09,819 --> 01:04:12,588
But you've got to want to return to reality.

688
01:04:14,740 --> 01:04:17,513
Let's assume I do. Then what?

689
01:04:20,329 --> 01:04:23,336
- Swallow this.
- What is it?

690
01:04:23,499 --> 01:04:27,416
It's a symbol of your desire to return to reality.

691
01:04:27,420 --> 01:04:29,759
Inside your dream, you'll fall asleep.

692
01:04:33,759 --> 01:04:38,052
All right, let's say you're telling
the truth and this is all a dream.

693
01:04:38,055 --> 01:04:41,024
Then I could pull this trigger,
and it won't matter.

694
01:04:41,028 --> 01:04:43,934
- Doug, don't.
- It won't make the slightest difference to me, Doug,...

695
01:04:43,936 --> 01:04:48,641
...but the consequences to you would be devastating.
In your mind I'll be dead.

696
01:04:48,644 --> 01:04:51,984
And with no one to guide you out,
you'll be stuck in permanent psychosis.

697
01:04:51,986 --> 01:04:54,458
Doug, let Dr. Edgemar help you.

698
01:04:54,461 --> 01:04:56,822
The walls of reality will come crashing down.

699
01:04:56,824 --> 01:05:00,366
In one minute you'll be the savior of the rebel cause,
and the next thing you know...

700
01:05:00,369 --> 01:05:02,458
...you'll be Cohaagen's bosom buddy.

701
01:05:02,621 --> 01:05:06,622
You even have fantasies about alien civilizations,
as you requested.

702
01:05:06,625 --> 01:05:09,436
But in the end,
back on earth you'll be lobotomized!

703
01:05:11,881 --> 01:05:15,442
So get a grip on yourself, Doug.
And put down that gun!

704
01:05:21,307 --> 01:05:24,660
Good.
Now take the pill and put it in your mouth.

705
01:05:29,315 --> 01:05:31,404
Swallow it!

706
01:05:33,944 --> 01:05:36,409
Go ahead, sweetheart.

707
01:05:59,178 --> 01:06:02,835
Now you've done it.
Now you've done it!

708
01:06:23,369 --> 01:06:25,750
That's for making me come to Mars.

709
01:06:27,123 --> 01:06:30,142
You know how much I hate this fucking planet!

710
01:06:32,461 --> 01:06:33,632
Cuff him.

711
01:06:40,344 --> 01:06:43,822
- I got him.
- Good bring him down to the service elevator.

712
01:06:46,016 --> 01:06:47,355
Let's go.

713
01:08:00,841 --> 01:08:02,429
Fuck you!

714
01:08:12,895 --> 01:08:13,993
Doug.

715
01:08:15,731 --> 01:08:17,737
Honey...

716
01:08:17,900 --> 01:08:20,586
...you wouldn't hurt me, would you, sweetheart?

717
01:08:22,238 --> 01:08:25,453
Sweetheart, be reasonable.

718
01:08:25,616 --> 01:08:27,621
After all, we're married.

719
01:08:33,290 --> 01:08:34,628
Consider that a divorce.

720
01:08:37,169 --> 01:08:38,799
That was your wife?

721
01:08:42,800 --> 01:08:44,138
What a bitch.

722
01:08:52,351 --> 01:08:54,357
Hey, get out of the way!

723
01:08:56,897 --> 01:08:59,403
I thought you didn't like me.

724
01:08:59,525 --> 01:09:02,526
If Cohaagen wants you dead, you might be okay.

725
01:09:02,528 --> 01:09:05,945
- Got it.
- So you come back to apologize?

726
01:09:05,948 --> 01:09:07,912
Kuato wants to see you.

727
01:09:09,744 --> 01:09:11,123
Come on.

728
01:09:39,648 --> 01:09:41,353
- Now what?
- Jump!

729
01:10:10,930 --> 01:10:14,867
No! Don't do it!
You'll crack the fucking dome!

730
01:10:18,312 --> 01:10:21,707
What are you trying to do, kill us?
The dome will crack!

731
01:10:33,702 --> 01:10:34,707
Move!

732
01:10:36,872 --> 01:10:38,627
Taxi!

733
01:10:39,708 --> 01:10:41,547
Melina! Melina!

734
01:10:44,755 --> 01:10:46,560
- Need a ride?
- The Last Resort! Quick!

735
01:10:46,564 --> 01:10:47,845
You guys are going in circles.

736
01:10:52,972 --> 01:10:53,993
Jesus!

737
01:10:54,056 --> 01:10:56,187
Come on! You drive!

738
01:10:56,350 --> 01:10:57,396
You guys are in trouble?

739
01:10:57,560 --> 01:10:59,065
Go! Go!

740
01:11:10,072 --> 01:11:13,392
- What are you trying to do to me man?
- Shut up and drive!

741
01:11:13,395 --> 01:11:15,947
Hey, I got five kids to feed!

742
01:11:49,361 --> 01:11:52,369
- Shit!
- No brakes!

743
01:11:52,531 --> 01:11:54,078
You idiot!

744
01:11:57,369 --> 01:11:58,690
What the hell are you doing?

745
01:12:10,883 --> 01:12:14,089
Christ! Now they're after me!

746
01:12:14,970 --> 01:12:16,517
Give me that!

747
01:12:16,680 --> 01:12:18,352
Get out of the way!

748
01:12:25,231 --> 01:12:26,402
Tony!

749
01:12:30,194 --> 01:12:32,491
Get out of the way!
Come on!

750
01:12:32,655 --> 01:12:35,077
Come on! Come on!

751
01:12:38,452 --> 01:12:39,832
Thank you, Tony.

752
01:13:04,854 --> 01:13:06,942
What to have some fun?

753
01:13:07,106 --> 01:13:08,194
Where are they?

754
01:13:08,357 --> 01:13:11,168
What are you talking about?
I don't know.

755
01:13:19,660 --> 01:13:21,031
Maybe you know.

756
01:13:28,093 --> 01:13:29,982
Kill them all!

757
01:13:43,942 --> 01:13:44,947
Thumbelina!

758
01:14:10,177 --> 01:14:11,682
Richter!

759
01:14:11,804 --> 01:14:15,035
- A call from Cohaagen!
- Richter here.

760
01:14:15,099 --> 01:14:18,142
- We got them pinned down.
- Stop fighting and pull out.

761
01:14:18,143 --> 01:14:20,162
But they've got Quaid.
They're protecting him.

762
01:14:21,480 --> 01:14:24,403
Perfect.
Get out of Sector G now.

763
01:14:24,566 --> 01:14:26,030
Don't think.

764
01:14:26,235 --> 01:14:28,907
- Do it!
- Yes, sir.

765
01:14:29,071 --> 01:14:30,659
Pull 'em out.

766
01:14:30,823 --> 01:14:33,078
Everybody pull out!

767
01:14:33,242 --> 01:14:34,747
Move!

768
01:14:43,877 --> 01:14:46,897
- Cohaagen's sealing off the area!
- Come on, Benny!

769
01:15:48,242 --> 01:15:50,081
The first settlers are buried here.

770
01:15:50,244 --> 01:15:54,246
They worked themselves to death,
but Cohaagen ended up with all the money.

771
01:15:54,248 --> 01:15:57,164
He built cheap domes and watched
their kids turn into freaks.

772
01:15:57,168 --> 01:15:58,339
I saw them.

773
01:15:58,502 --> 01:16:01,293
And if you want to breathe,
you have to buy his air.

774
01:16:01,297 --> 01:16:02,802
But maybe you can change all that.

775
01:16:02,965 --> 01:16:07,139
Hey, I think my grandpa might be here.

776
01:16:07,261 --> 01:16:08,808
So what can I do?

777
01:16:08,971 --> 01:16:11,679
Kuato's gonna make you remember some
things you knew when you were Hauser.

778
01:16:11,682 --> 01:16:14,355
- Like what?
- All sorts of things.

779
01:16:14,518 --> 01:16:17,621
- Like maybe you'll remember that you loved me.
- I don't need Kuato for that.

780
01:16:18,662 --> 01:16:20,614
Oh, since when?

781
01:16:30,618 --> 01:16:33,797
- Freeze!
- Come on, Melina.

782
01:16:35,206 --> 01:16:36,544
Kuato's waiting.

783
01:16:36,707 --> 01:16:38,879
Well I didn't find him, but--

784
01:16:40,294 --> 01:16:41,674
Oh, shit.

785
01:16:41,795 --> 01:16:44,885
- Who's this?
- He helped us get away.

786
01:16:45,049 --> 01:16:49,661
Hey, don't worry about me, man.
I'm on your side.

787
01:16:59,855 --> 01:17:01,735
You're a mutant, huh?

788
01:17:01,857 --> 01:17:04,113
All right, let's go.

789
01:17:19,166 --> 01:17:22,207
- Have you tried ramming down the door?
- You wait here. Follow me.

790
01:17:22,211 --> 01:17:24,049
It won't do any good.

791
01:17:24,213 --> 01:17:27,630
- Cohaagen depressurized the tunnels.
- Then drill through to Section M.

792
01:17:27,633 --> 01:17:30,514
We can't.
We're running out of air.

793
01:17:30,678 --> 01:17:35,500
- We need help.
- Okay, sit tight. Melina just got here with Quaid.

794
01:17:36,517 --> 01:17:38,189
I hope he was worth it.

795
01:17:38,352 --> 01:17:39,899
So do I.

796
01:17:42,356 --> 01:17:44,315
- I'm glad you made it.
- You don't look so glad.

797
01:17:44,316 --> 01:17:47,691
Cohaagen sealed up Venusville.
He shut off all the air.

798
01:17:47,695 --> 01:17:50,027
You must know something pretty damn important, Quaid.

799
01:17:50,030 --> 01:17:51,911
He wants you.

800
01:17:52,032 --> 01:17:55,750
If we don't hand you over,
everybody in this sector will be dead by morning.

801
01:17:55,753 --> 01:17:57,641
Well then we don't have much choice then, do we?

802
01:17:57,645 --> 01:17:58,968
We can't turn him in.

803
01:18:00,174 --> 01:18:03,168
That's up to Kuato.
Come with me, Quaid.

804
01:18:16,899 --> 01:18:18,863
Sit down.

805
01:18:19,026 --> 01:18:21,741
- Where's Kuato?
- On his way.

806
01:18:21,904 --> 01:18:24,528
You heard the rumors about the Pyramid Mine?

807
01:18:24,532 --> 01:18:26,287
Yeah.

808
01:18:26,450 --> 01:18:29,869
Cohaagen found something weird inside
and it's got him scared shitless.

809
01:18:29,870 --> 01:18:32,084
What? Aliens?

810
01:18:33,541 --> 01:18:36,464
- You tell me.
- I don't know.

811
01:18:36,627 --> 01:18:39,251
Yes, you do.
That's why we brought you here.

812
01:18:39,255 --> 01:18:43,982
Cohaagen's big secret
is buried in that black hole you call a brain.

813
01:18:46,512 --> 01:18:48,434
And Kuato's gonna dig it out.

814
01:18:48,556 --> 01:18:51,938
- You're Kuato, right?
- Wrong.

815
01:18:52,059 --> 01:18:55,996
Kuato's a mutant,
so don't get upset when you see him.

816
01:19:34,602 --> 01:19:37,091
What do you want, Mr. Quaid?

817
01:19:37,647 --> 01:19:42,347
- Same as you: to remember.
- But why?

818
01:19:42,443 --> 01:19:46,038
- To be myself again.
- You are what you do.

819
01:19:49,158 --> 01:19:54,689
A man is defined by his actions not his memory.

820
01:19:55,790 --> 01:19:59,163
Please. Take my hands.

821
01:20:04,757 --> 01:20:07,396
Now open your mind to me.

822
01:20:08,135 --> 01:20:09,515
Please.

823
01:20:12,306 --> 01:20:15,154
Open your mind.

824
01:20:17,186 --> 01:20:20,050
Open your mind.

825
01:20:21,816 --> 01:20:25,497
Open your mind.

826
01:20:27,029 --> 01:20:30,961
Open your mind.

827
01:20:32,535 --> 01:20:37,334
Open your mind.

828
01:21:07,486 --> 01:21:09,944
We should blow the thing up
before the rebels turn it on.

829
01:21:09,947 --> 01:21:12,655
I say we throw the switch and see what happens.

830
01:21:12,658 --> 01:21:14,780
- Don't be an idiot.
- We can't risk it.

831
01:21:14,784 --> 01:21:17,495
The chain reaction could spread
to all the turbinium in the crust.

832
01:21:17,496 --> 01:21:20,788
That means a meltdown,
a meltdown on a planetary scale.

833
01:21:20,791 --> 01:21:23,165
Don't you think whoever
built this thing thought of that?

834
01:21:23,169 --> 01:21:26,419
Who knows what the hell they thought?
They weren't human.

835
01:21:26,422 --> 01:21:29,171
Maybe it's a trap.
Maybe they want a meltdown.

836
01:21:29,175 --> 01:21:31,424
We don't even know if this
piece of junk will even work.

837
01:21:31,427 --> 01:21:33,683
What is it?
A million? Half a million?

838
01:21:33,846 --> 01:21:37,221
- About half a million.
- Half a million years old.

839
01:21:37,224 --> 01:21:38,896
Well let's make sure Kuato--

840
01:22:09,465 --> 01:22:13,347
Wake up! Wake up!
Come on, wake up!

841
01:22:14,762 --> 01:22:17,668
They found us! Shit!
Let's go!

842
01:22:18,557 --> 01:22:20,730
Wake up! Snap out of it!
Now! Come on!

843
01:22:25,398 --> 01:22:26,694
They found us!

844
01:22:26,857 --> 01:22:28,279
- Everybody out!
- Melina!

845
01:22:28,442 --> 01:22:30,448
Get moving! Get out!

846
01:22:31,779 --> 01:22:32,710
Get out!

847
01:22:42,456 --> 01:22:44,462
Everybody out! Get out!

848
01:22:50,214 --> 01:22:52,595
Get to the air lock! Follow me!

849
01:22:54,302 --> 01:22:56,148
Benny, come on!

850
01:22:59,974 --> 01:23:02,521
- Benny!
- I'm coming!

851
01:23:21,746 --> 01:23:25,474
Put these spacesuits on!
We're going outside!

852
01:23:28,294 --> 01:23:29,966
Benny, hurry.

853
01:23:37,511 --> 01:23:39,392
Congratulations, Quaid.

854
01:23:39,513 --> 01:23:41,727
You led us right to him.

855
01:23:41,891 --> 01:23:44,564
How could you do this?
You're a mutant.

856
01:23:45,603 --> 01:23:47,441
Hey, I got four kids to feed.

857
01:23:47,605 --> 01:23:49,694
So what happened to number five?

858
01:23:52,234 --> 01:23:56,582
Ah, shit man. You got me.
I ain't even married.

859
01:23:56,697 --> 01:23:58,786
Now put your fucking hands in the air!

860
01:24:04,747 --> 01:24:06,127
Quaid.

861
01:24:08,292 --> 01:24:10,256
Quaid.

862
01:24:12,046 --> 01:24:16,442
Forget it, bro.
His fortune telling days are over.

863
01:24:18,094 --> 01:24:20,892
Start the reactor.

864
01:24:21,055 --> 01:24:23,052
Free Mars.

865
01:24:28,062 --> 01:24:30,568
Mr. Cohaagen would like to talk to you.

866
01:24:38,489 --> 01:24:40,786
So this is the great man.

867
01:24:45,830 --> 01:24:47,793
No wonder he kept out of sight.

868
01:24:50,126 --> 01:24:55,506
Well, my boy you're a hero.

869
01:24:55,514 --> 01:24:56,469
Fuck you.

870
01:24:56,632 --> 01:25:00,306
Don't be modest.
Kuato is dead.

871
01:25:00,428 --> 01:25:04,845
The resistance has been completely wiped out,
and you were the key to the whole thing.

872
01:25:04,849 --> 01:25:06,187
He's lying.

873
01:25:07,143 --> 01:25:09,232
You two-faced bastard.

874
01:25:11,188 --> 01:25:15,159
You can't blame him, angel.
He's innocent.

875
01:25:16,485 --> 01:25:20,986
You see, Quaid,
none of my people could get close to Kuato.

876
01:25:20,990 --> 01:25:23,989
The fucking mutants could always sniff us out.

877
01:25:23,993 --> 01:25:28,160
So Hauser and I sat down and invented you,
the perfect mole.

878
01:25:28,164 --> 01:25:31,434
You know you're lying.
Hauser turned against you.

879
01:25:35,129 --> 01:25:37,009
That's what we wanted you to think.

880
01:25:37,173 --> 01:25:41,382
The fact is,
Hauser volunteered to become Doug Quaid.

881
01:25:41,385 --> 01:25:44,468
It was the only way to fool the psychics.

882
01:25:44,472 --> 01:25:45,893
Well get your story straight.

883
01:25:46,057 --> 01:25:49,640
This idiot here has been trying to kill
me ever since I went to Rekall.

884
01:25:49,644 --> 01:25:51,977
You don't kill somebody you're trying to plant.

885
01:25:51,979 --> 01:25:55,981
He wasn't in on it.
You set him off by going to Rekall.

886
01:25:55,983 --> 01:25:58,984
- So why am I still alive?
- We gave you lots of help.

887
01:25:58,986 --> 01:26:00,866
- Benny here.
- My pleasure, man.

888
01:26:00,988 --> 01:26:04,615
The guy with the suitcase, the mask, the money,...

889
01:26:04,617 --> 01:26:08,659
...the message from Hauser.
All of that was set up by us.

890
01:26:08,663 --> 01:26:11,085
Sorry. Too perfect.

891
01:26:11,248 --> 01:26:12,837
Perfect, my ass!

892
01:26:12,959 --> 01:26:15,666
You pop your memory cap
before we can activate you.

893
01:26:15,670 --> 01:26:19,837
Richter goes hog-wild, screwing up
everything I spent a year planning.

894
01:26:19,840 --> 01:26:22,597
Frankly, I'm amazed it worked.

895
01:26:23,844 --> 01:26:25,224
Well, Cohaagen...

896
01:26:25,346 --> 01:26:29,316
...I have to hand it to you.
This is the best mind fuck yet.

897
01:26:30,184 --> 01:26:33,399
Well, don't take my word for it, Quaid.

898
01:26:34,647 --> 01:26:39,775
- Someone you trust wants to talk to you.
- Who is it this time--my mother?

899
01:26:41,862 --> 01:26:43,242
Howdy, Quaid.

900
01:26:43,364 --> 01:26:49,367
If you're listening to this,
that means that Kuato is dead and you have led us to him.

901
01:26:49,370 --> 01:26:51,292
I knew you wouldn't let me down.

902
01:26:51,455 --> 01:26:56,244
Sorry for all the shit I've put you through.
But hey, what are friends for?

903
01:26:56,294 --> 01:26:59,668
I would like to wish you happiness
and long life, old buddy...

904
01:26:59,672 --> 01:27:02,715
...but unfortunately, this is not gonna happen.

905
01:27:02,717 --> 01:27:06,967
You see, that's my body you've got there,
and, I want it back.

906
01:27:06,971 --> 01:27:11,305
Sorry to be an Indian giver, but I was here first.

907
01:27:11,309 --> 01:27:17,264
So adios, amigo,
and thanks for not getting yourself killed.

908
01:27:17,273 --> 01:27:19,820
Hey, maybe we'll meet in our dreams.

909
01:27:23,529 --> 01:27:25,368
You never know.

910
01:27:30,202 --> 01:27:32,208
You bastards!

911
01:27:50,431 --> 01:27:51,852
Let go of me!

912
01:28:07,948 --> 01:28:10,237
- Ready?
- Auto.

913
01:28:10,241 --> 01:28:13,040
- Check.
- Ready to go, sir.

914
01:28:15,122 --> 01:28:17,295
Relax, Quaid.

915
01:28:17,416 --> 01:28:20,875
- You'll like being Hauser.
- The guy's a fucking asshole.

916
01:28:20,878 --> 01:28:24,211
Not true.
He's one of my best friends.

917
01:28:24,215 --> 01:28:27,214
Besides, he's got a big house and a Mercedes.

918
01:28:27,218 --> 01:28:31,302
You like Melina, right?
Well, you'll get to fuck her every night.

919
01:28:31,305 --> 01:28:34,473
That's right.
She's going to be Hauser's babe.

920
01:28:34,475 --> 01:28:36,806
I'll bust his balls.

921
01:28:38,813 --> 01:28:41,027
Uh-uh, princess.

922
01:28:41,190 --> 01:28:43,529
We're having you fixed.

923
01:28:43,651 --> 01:28:47,109
You're going to be respectful and compliant...

924
01:28:47,113 --> 01:28:50,716
...and appreciative, just the way a woman should be.

925
01:28:54,370 --> 01:28:56,375
Mr. Cohaagen Telephone.

926
01:28:59,208 --> 01:29:03,896
- Yes? What is it?
- Sir, the oxygen level is bottoming out in Sector G.

927
01:29:03,908 --> 01:29:05,968
What do you want me to do about it?

928
01:29:06,132 --> 01:29:10,257
- Don't do anything.
- But they won't last an hour, sir.

929
01:29:10,261 --> 01:29:11,265
Fuck 'em.

930
01:29:11,429 --> 01:29:13,293
It'll be a good lesson to the others.

931
01:29:13,346 --> 01:29:16,807
Come on, Cohaagen! You got what you want.
Give these people air.

932
01:29:16,809 --> 01:29:20,644
My friend, in five minutes,
you won't give a shit about the people.

933
01:29:20,646 --> 01:29:24,259
- Fire it up, Doc.
- Excuse me, Doctor...

934
01:29:24,261 --> 01:29:26,460
- ...is he gonna remember any of this?
- Not a thing.

935
01:29:27,278 --> 01:29:28,449
Oh, really?

936
01:29:38,998 --> 01:29:41,186
Oh, Quaid, I'm having a party tonight.

937
01:29:41,188 --> 01:29:43,541
Why don't you and Melina drop by?
Remind him, Doc?

938
01:29:43,544 --> 01:29:45,800
- Sure.
- See you at the party.

939
01:30:00,436 --> 01:30:03,258
Keep still.
Fighting just makes it hurt.

940
01:30:15,743 --> 01:30:18,937
If you don't keep still, you'll end up psychotic.

941
01:30:22,708 --> 01:30:24,088
Hey, don't!

942
01:30:31,133 --> 01:30:32,763
Melina, hold on!

943
01:30:55,741 --> 01:30:58,998
Are you all right?
Are you still you?

944
01:30:59,120 --> 01:31:02,460
I'm not sure, dear.
What do you think?

945
01:31:05,376 --> 01:31:06,914
Let's get the hell out of here.

946
01:31:34,322 --> 01:31:36,577
You have to make a decision, sir.

947
01:31:47,126 --> 01:31:48,297
Kill him.

948
01:31:49,587 --> 01:31:51,509
It's about goddamn time.

949
01:32:43,849 --> 01:32:46,564
- Where are you going?
- To the reactor.

950
01:32:46,727 --> 01:32:50,561
- What reactor?
- The one in the mines. Come on!

951
01:32:50,564 --> 01:32:54,567
People are dying, Quaid!
Stop! We've got to get air!

952
01:32:54,568 --> 01:32:57,860
The reactor makes air.
That's Cohaagen's secret. Let's go.

953
01:32:57,863 --> 01:32:59,668
Where's this reactor come from?

954
01:32:59,672 --> 01:33:01,795
- Aliens built it.
- Aliens?

955
01:33:01,799 --> 01:33:05,096
- Are you sure about this?
- It's just up ahead.

956
01:33:07,581 --> 01:33:08,953
What the hell--

957
01:33:33,316 --> 01:33:34,315
Quaid!

958
01:33:34,317 --> 01:33:37,365
Hey, Quaid, you remember me?

959
01:33:37,528 --> 01:33:40,084
Benny! Benny's the name!

960
01:33:54,003 --> 01:33:55,724
Oh, that's good!

961
01:34:01,302 --> 01:34:05,716
I'm gonna drill you, sucker!
I'm gonna grind you up!

962
01:34:12,647 --> 01:34:14,569
I'm coming!

963
01:34:14,732 --> 01:34:16,820
I'm coming for you, baby!

964
01:34:32,374 --> 01:34:34,746
What the fuck is this?

965
01:34:41,175 --> 01:34:43,222
Damn this piece of Martian junk!

966
01:34:45,679 --> 01:34:48,352
Hey, Quaid, I'm gonna squash you!

967
01:34:49,391 --> 01:34:51,230
Benny, here!

968
01:34:54,480 --> 01:34:56,226
Where the fuck are you?

969
01:35:01,778 --> 01:35:03,450
Screw you!

970
01:35:09,578 --> 01:35:11,583
Quaid, get over here!

971
01:35:11,747 --> 01:35:13,419
What is it?

972
01:35:14,458 --> 01:35:15,462
There's an opening.

973
01:35:16,668 --> 01:35:18,257
I knew it.

974
01:35:46,674 --> 01:35:49,949
This whole thing is one big reactor made out of turbinium.

975
01:35:49,952 --> 01:35:53,412
Cohaagen knows it makes air.
The bastard won't turn it on.

976
01:35:53,414 --> 01:35:57,327
Of course not.
If Mars had an atmosphere, he'd lose control.

977
01:35:58,878 --> 01:36:00,216
See down there.

978
01:36:01,422 --> 01:36:03,803
It's a glacier.

979
01:36:03,924 --> 01:36:06,973
The whole core of Mars is ice.

980
01:36:07,094 --> 01:36:11,513
The reactor melts it and it releases the oxygen.

981
01:36:11,515 --> 01:36:12,812
Come on.

982
01:36:12,933 --> 01:36:16,016
- Enough for everyone to breathe?
- Sure.

983
01:36:16,020 --> 01:36:18,859
Enough for the whole planet.

984
01:36:19,023 --> 01:36:21,195
If we turn it on in time.

985
01:36:27,907 --> 01:36:29,787
Come on. Come on!

986
01:36:47,051 --> 01:36:48,055
Hold on.

987
01:37:19,375 --> 01:37:20,434
Now!

988
01:37:50,865 --> 01:37:52,394
Son of a bitch.

989
01:37:59,790 --> 01:38:00,638
Go!

990
01:38:04,211 --> 01:38:06,600
He's got a hologram!

991
01:38:28,235 --> 01:38:30,925
You think this is the real Quaid?
It is.

992
01:39:50,776 --> 01:39:52,823
You're coming with me!

993
01:40:06,375 --> 01:40:08,548
See you at the party, Richter.

994
01:40:46,874 --> 01:40:50,095
Don't touch that!
Get away! Get back!

995
01:40:50,211 --> 01:40:51,591
What are you afraid of?

996
01:40:51,712 --> 01:40:54,051
- Turn it on.
- Impossible!

997
01:40:54,215 --> 01:40:57,423
Once the reaction starts,
it'll spread to all the turbinium in the planet.

998
01:40:57,426 --> 01:41:02,550
Mars will go into global meltdown.
That's why the aliens never turned it on.

999
01:41:02,556 --> 01:41:04,762
Do you expect me to believe you?

1000
01:41:04,765 --> 01:41:09,351
Who gives a shit what you believe?
In 30 seconds you'll be dead.

1001
01:41:09,355 --> 01:41:12,833
Then I'll blow this place up
and be home in time for corn flakes.

1002
01:41:16,320 --> 01:41:18,159
I didn't want it to end this way.

1003
01:41:18,322 --> 01:41:20,986
I wanted Hauser back.
But no.

1004
01:41:21,575 --> 01:41:23,748
You had to be Quaid!

1005
01:41:23,869 --> 01:41:26,250
- I am Quaid.
- You're nothing!

1006
01:41:26,414 --> 01:41:29,420
You're nobody!
You're a stupid dream.

1007
01:41:29,583 --> 01:41:33,507
Well, all dreams come to an end.

1008
01:42:48,371 --> 01:42:50,668
- Melina, hold on!
- No.

1009
01:42:50,790 --> 01:42:52,436
Don't do it!

1010
01:42:52,500 --> 01:42:54,680
We'll all die!

1011
01:42:55,336 --> 01:42:57,717
Everybody will die!

1012
01:44:00,860 --> 01:44:02,623
Quaid!

1013
01:45:20,424 --> 01:45:21,624
Hold on!

1014
01:49:17,510 --> 01:49:19,849
I can't believe it.
It's like a dream.

1015
01:49:21,180 --> 01:49:22,768
What's wrong?

1016
01:49:22,932 --> 01:49:26,827
I just had a terrible thought.
What if this is a dream?

1017
01:49:28,270 --> 01:49:31,457
Well, then kiss me quick
before you wake up.
