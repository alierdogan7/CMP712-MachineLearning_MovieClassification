1
00:03:22,435 --> 00:03:23,094
Close it!

2
00:03:46,726 --> 00:03:47,920
Move!

3
00:03:48,661 --> 00:03:49,457
Close it!

4
00:04:51,524 --> 00:04:52,616
Take out the ammunition

5
00:05:53,853 --> 00:05:55,081
take it out!

6
00:05:56,622 --> 00:05:57,384
Yes Qasim!

7
00:05:57,890 --> 00:05:58,948
I have found the back door

8
00:05:59,525 --> 00:06:01,015
Give me the order!

9
00:06:01,494 --> 00:06:03,155
Don't spare anyone alive

10
00:06:04,897 --> 00:06:06,888
Understood!
Kill everyone

11
00:06:24,016 --> 00:06:25,574
Give me the bomb!

12
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:24,094
Fazal Khan is dead!

13
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:36,038
Now we will know who died and
who survived

14
00:08:38,417 --> 00:08:39,008
Qasim!

15
00:08:39,952 --> 00:08:40,976
Move!

16
00:08:46,425 --> 00:08:48,916
I was about to shoot Vinod on his ass
but he came to my front

17
00:08:59,438 --> 00:09:01,736
Anchor asked to Minister on TV

18
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:03,634
Tell me our national anthem

19
00:09:04,777 --> 00:09:05,766
So he start singing

20
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:12,147
That's our minister

21
00:09:18,991 --> 00:09:20,322
Fazal Khan is dead

22
00:09:21,727 --> 00:09:25,595
I have demolished his entire castle

23
00:09:28,668 --> 00:09:30,568
Stop the car!
It's police check post

24
00:09:33,506 --> 00:09:34,803
Why this police check post is here?

25
00:09:36,375 --> 00:09:37,569
What we do now?
Shall we go?

26
00:09:40,212 --> 00:09:40,871
Leave it!

27
00:09:41,547 --> 00:09:43,037
This check post is for us

28
00:09:54,293 --> 00:09:54,987
Don't shoot here!

29
00:10:19,852 --> 00:10:22,252
There are two kinds of human

30
00:10:22,755 --> 00:10:25,519
One form is Clever and
second form is stupid

31
00:10:26,392 --> 00:10:27,859
And this game is based upon these
two kind of humans

32
00:10:29,562 --> 00:10:32,122
Now when some clever human started
foolish things

33
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:35,400
and when some fool has become a
part of cleverness

34
00:10:35,735 --> 00:10:36,702
You never find out

35
00:10:37,169 --> 00:10:38,830
This Wasseypur's story is strange

36
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:40,302
If you will see from outside

37
00:10:40,573 --> 00:10:42,063
then Wasseypur is the village of
decent men

38
00:10:42,842 --> 00:10:43,570
but when you enter inside...

39
00:10:43,843 --> 00:10:46,073
then there are lot of bastards are
hidden inside...

40
00:10:47,947 --> 00:10:50,438
Now what they have been proved
in the end that's another thing

41
00:10:50,683 --> 00:10:54,084
at least they all think themselves
Clever in their lives...

42
00:10:55,254 --> 00:10:57,119
We muslim's battle is not today's war

43
00:10:57,690 --> 00:10:58,714
it has been running since centuries...

44
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:02,055
And in Wasseypur this fight was not
between Shia and Sunni

45
00:11:02,561 --> 00:11:03,823
All of them were Sunni

46
00:11:04,163 --> 00:11:07,599
This fight was between Qureshis and
other muslims...

47
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:09,124
It has announced war later

48
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:10,628
earlier it was one sided attacks...

49
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:13,200
Qureshi were butchers...

50
00:11:13,706 --> 00:11:15,333
and Everyone was scared from Butchers

51
00:11:15,808 --> 00:11:18,174
They scared the people...

52
00:11:18,711 --> 00:11:21,339
Now Qureshis were ruling
in Wasseypur

53
00:11:21,781 --> 00:11:24,944
When this village was outside
the Dhanbad

54
00:11:25,885 --> 00:11:28,718
and then Dhanbad become
a part of Bengal

55
00:11:29,455 --> 00:11:32,891
After freedom Dhanbad went to Bihar

56
00:11:33,459 --> 00:11:36,587
and Wasseypur has become a part
of Dhanbad

57
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:39,159
Now Dhanbad is in Jharkandh

58
00:11:39,465 --> 00:11:41,626
And Wasseypur is in the centre
of Dhanbad

59
00:11:42,001 --> 00:11:42,524
Anyway!

60
00:11:42,868 --> 00:11:43,926
Story is still running

61
00:11:44,403 --> 00:11:45,495
But it was started

62
00:11:45,971 --> 00:11:47,233
when around Dhanbad...

63
00:11:47,406 --> 00:11:50,637
British has occupied all the harvests

64
00:11:50,876 --> 00:11:52,400
and started coal business

65
00:11:52,845 --> 00:11:55,006
when trains runs with coal...

66
00:11:55,314 --> 00:11:58,545
and all factories and machines
runs with coal

67
00:12:00,152 --> 00:12:02,143
When Sultana dacoit used to live here...

68
00:12:02,655 --> 00:12:04,316
and he robbed their trains

69
00:12:05,424 --> 00:12:08,655
That man attacked on british trains
and robbed their treasures

70
00:12:09,862 --> 00:12:11,921
One day force were travelling in train
instead of treasure

71
00:12:12,998 --> 00:12:14,590
when Sultana attacked on the train

72
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,400
British has arrested him and sent
him to Black Water

73
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:21,369
Mulla Jee told me that British gave
him death sentence

74
00:12:23,542 --> 00:12:25,169
Your Moulvi is a stupid man

75
00:12:25,945 --> 00:12:28,004
Actually Sultana was Qureshi

76
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:36,911
He is in Wasseypur

77
00:12:37,389 --> 00:12:40,517
and british is still looking for him
and he's still robbing their trains

78
00:13:20,466 --> 00:13:22,434
We have removed the tracks

79
00:13:22,601 --> 00:13:24,466
if you will drive it then you will
be stuck

80
00:13:26,305 --> 00:13:28,830
There is nothing in train but food bags

81
00:13:28,974 --> 00:13:30,305
We are also businessmen

82
00:13:30,943 --> 00:13:32,501
We are not dacoits who came to
rob the money

83
00:13:33,379 --> 00:13:35,404
We have quit rob the treasure...

84
00:13:36,549 --> 00:13:39,074
Now Sultana robs the food bags

85
00:13:41,587 --> 00:13:42,144
May I go?

86
00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:45,714
You have train

87
00:13:46,258 --> 00:13:47,350
and I have bull cart

88
00:13:47,993 --> 00:13:50,553
So until I don't return and ask
you to leave

89
00:13:50,729 --> 00:13:52,492
till then sit here...

90
00:14:22,127 --> 00:14:23,594
Where is the car?
I don't know

91
00:14:24,997 --> 00:14:25,929
Open the box
I will check...

92
00:14:32,404 --> 00:14:33,302
Why did you stop the train?

93
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:35,204
Train is empty

94
00:14:36,175 --> 00:14:37,164
Why all boxes are empty?

95
00:14:37,977 --> 00:14:39,069
Sultana dacoit came...

96
00:14:39,912 --> 00:14:41,106
he robbed all the food...

97
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:46,010
There is someone who is robbing the
train with my name

98
00:14:47,119 --> 00:14:48,017
Who could he be?

99
00:14:51,223 --> 00:14:51,848
Shahid Khan!

100
00:14:52,691 --> 00:14:54,716
He is only person who have horse

101
00:14:59,231 --> 00:15:00,425
But his horse used for
commercial purpose

102
00:15:00,933 --> 00:15:01,900
It was...

103
00:15:02,301 --> 00:15:03,325
but now he sell food...

104
00:15:16,482 --> 00:15:17,414
How is your business?

105
00:15:17,683 --> 00:15:19,116
Entire market is finished...

106
00:15:20,152 --> 00:15:22,620
He is selling the food in cheap prices

107
00:15:23,789 --> 00:15:25,689
If we will try to fight so we will
be finish...

108
00:15:32,898 --> 00:15:33,990
When your younger brother will come?

109
00:15:35,634 --> 00:15:36,726
He should have come in 2 months

110
00:15:44,043 --> 00:15:47,308
Train track passes from the
Qureshi neighbourhood

111
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:49,843
only qureshi lives both side
of the track

112
00:15:50,683 --> 00:15:54,175
So Qureshi have right on every train

113
00:15:54,353 --> 00:15:55,377
nor any pathan...

114
00:15:57,990 --> 00:15:58,581
Look!

115
00:15:59,258 --> 00:16:00,657
I just want to tell you one thing

116
00:16:02,027 --> 00:16:02,891
Whatever you do

117
00:16:03,762 --> 00:16:04,820
but don't do blood bath

118
00:16:06,398 --> 00:16:08,195
Shahid is also belongs to
this Wasseypur

119
00:16:08,367 --> 00:16:09,857
But he doesn't belongs to our caste...

120
00:16:10,202 --> 00:16:12,432
If we will be caught so we appologize
to Mukhtar Sahab

121
00:16:13,272 --> 00:16:14,364
He won't kill us

122
00:16:15,174 --> 00:16:16,163
If he will kill us then...

123
00:16:19,378 --> 00:16:20,367
He won't do it

124
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:22,310
I know him

125
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:24,415
Dog never change it's breed

126
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:26,682
If you don't beat the horse so
he never run

127
00:16:27,486 --> 00:16:28,714
Shahid was stubborn like that

128
00:16:29,321 --> 00:16:30,185
His life was in danger

129
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:32,556
Everyone knew that who is
robbing the trains...

130
00:16:33,158 --> 00:16:34,750
but how do he listen to anyone

131
00:16:41,133 --> 00:16:42,327
Are you scared?

132
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:44,735
Do you know who is Shareef Qureshi?

133
00:16:45,604 --> 00:16:47,162
You are using his name

134
00:16:48,374 --> 00:16:49,807
Sultana dacoit died in black water

135
00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:51,533
and the rest are stories...

136
00:16:52,878 --> 00:16:54,402
He is butcher
So what will he do?

137
00:16:55,414 --> 00:16:57,211
We pathans keep thousand butchers
in our houses

138
00:16:58,350 --> 00:17:00,215
They are weak like their goats

139
00:17:06,225 --> 00:17:09,854
And tomorrow I will remove the train
from the tracks

140
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:34,182
Here they come!

141
00:17:39,825 --> 00:17:40,985
Run for your lives

142
00:17:59,445 --> 00:18:01,072
Don't spare anyone alive

143
00:19:04,877 --> 00:19:05,536
Where is everyone?

144
00:19:06,678 --> 00:19:07,508
Only I am alive

145
00:19:09,281 --> 00:19:10,270
They have killed all of them

146
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:17,311
You said that they won't
do anything

147
00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:20,718
tell him to leave Wasseypur with
his family

148
00:19:22,461 --> 00:19:23,223
We will go...

149
00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:26,497
but ask him how I will feed them

150
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:28,125
and by the way what have
I done with him

151
00:19:35,674 --> 00:19:36,572
One food bag

152
00:19:37,376 --> 00:19:40,834
will reach to your him from
every train

153
00:19:43,215 --> 00:19:43,874
Fine!

154
00:19:44,583 --> 00:19:46,244
Don't give him any food bag

155
00:19:52,824 --> 00:19:54,758
Shahid khan must escaped for
his life

156
00:19:55,093 --> 00:19:56,082
but he was not coward

157
00:19:56,895 --> 00:19:59,090
He knew that Qureshi won't
spare him

158
00:20:25,090 --> 00:20:27,183
We all lived in Darbar

159
00:20:27,993 --> 00:20:30,723
Shahid's wife gave him his
kid's swear

160
00:20:31,263 --> 00:20:33,197
that he will quit his bad habits

161
00:20:33,565 --> 00:20:34,657
and he will find a job

162
00:20:59,891 --> 00:21:00,983
Please stop the work

163
00:21:01,526 --> 00:21:02,754
Water is pouring inside...

164
00:21:03,362 --> 00:21:04,693
Everyone will sink down
Do your work!

165
00:21:05,097 --> 00:21:07,327
Even 9 hours are not completed
from 12 hours job

166
00:21:07,933 --> 00:21:10,766
Everyone will sink down...
Nobody else is asking for me

167
00:21:11,370 --> 00:21:13,304
Then why you have a problem

168
00:21:20,312 --> 00:21:20,937
What?

169
00:21:21,079 --> 00:21:22,341
Shahid Khan!

170
00:21:22,914 --> 00:21:24,882
His baby is stuck in his wife's womb

171
00:21:25,183 --> 00:21:25,672
So?

172
00:21:25,951 --> 00:21:28,078
Please give him news,

173
00:21:28,587 --> 00:21:30,020
No need of it,
Get lost from here

174
00:21:30,489 --> 00:21:32,855
Nobody will stop the work before
12 hours

175
00:21:33,892 --> 00:21:35,416
If anyone will stop the work

176
00:21:37,863 --> 00:21:40,764
then I will remove his skin and hang
him to butcher market

177
00:21:41,967 --> 00:21:42,797
Do something!

178
00:21:49,708 --> 00:21:51,198
Do your work!
Don't talk

179
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:56,147
What are looking at me?

180
00:21:58,717 --> 00:21:59,684
I have to go

181
00:22:00,185 --> 00:22:01,482
Kid is stuck in wife's womb

182
00:22:02,421 --> 00:22:03,513
It doesn't stuck in your womb

183
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:05,187
Do your work

184
00:22:05,857 --> 00:22:06,983
I insist let me go!

185
00:22:08,527 --> 00:22:09,789
Don't you understand?

186
00:22:34,286 --> 00:22:34,945
Open it!

187
00:22:35,487 --> 00:22:36,249
Why?

188
00:22:36,588 --> 00:22:38,146
Are you a Governer?

189
00:22:40,092 --> 00:22:42,458
I am not from those people who will
endure your abuses

190
00:22:43,061 --> 00:22:44,995
I have done my work with honesty

191
00:22:45,430 --> 00:22:47,261
If I will be late today

192
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:51,601
then I will kill you...

193
00:22:59,044 --> 00:22:59,703
How she is?

194
00:23:00,178 --> 00:23:01,543
She is in pain!
So why you didn't come earlier?

195
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:02,969
I wanted to come

196
00:23:03,515 --> 00:23:04,675
but he didn't let me come

197
00:23:14,359 --> 00:23:16,156
It's been 6 hours but kid is
not coming out

198
00:23:16,328 --> 00:23:17,955
what were you doing from 6 hours?
I was coming but...

199
00:23:18,330 --> 00:23:19,524
he pushed me away

200
00:24:20,025 --> 00:24:22,687
We can't blame to God for
life and death

201
00:24:23,829 --> 00:24:26,957
We gave life with our wish and
sometimes by mistake

202
00:24:27,999 --> 00:24:30,490
but people died from our mistake

203
00:24:31,236 --> 00:24:32,498
It wasn't that Pehelwan's mistake

204
00:24:33,138 --> 00:24:34,730
who didn't let me come

205
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:36,270
It was my mistake

206
00:24:36,908 --> 00:24:38,205
that I defeated from that Pehelwan

207
00:24:39,110 --> 00:24:42,409
And I have to suffer the punishment
of my weakness

208
00:24:44,082 --> 00:24:45,777
Shahid Khan will kill our man

209
00:24:46,551 --> 00:24:47,210
Who Shahid Khan?

210
00:36:28,052 --> 00:36:30,452
Do you accept this marriage?
Yes! I do...

211
00:36:51,142 --> 00:36:51,665
Coming!

212
00:37:30,781 --> 00:37:32,009
He killed my father

213
00:37:33,150 --> 00:37:36,244
My father sat in his car and gone
with him

214
00:37:37,221 --> 00:37:38,279
he never came back

215
00:37:39,690 --> 00:37:41,681
I have only object in my life

216
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:43,317
Revenge!

217
00:37:46,030 --> 00:37:50,023
I can't see Ramdheer Singh's progress

218
00:37:53,237 --> 00:37:55,171
I have to finish that bastard

219
00:37:56,874 --> 00:37:58,307
I won't shoot him

220
00:38:00,044 --> 00:38:01,443
I will make fun of him

221
00:38:05,149 --> 00:38:07,083
I will show him his value

222
00:38:08,052 --> 00:38:11,681
Slowly slowly I will snatch everything
from him so he will die...

223
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:31,108
I am standing on this stage and
promise you

224
00:38:34,745 --> 00:38:37,839
In 1952 when Jeewan Raam was
announced Minister

225
00:38:41,719 --> 00:38:45,314
so he announced Coal Welfare
Association to see labour's condition

226
00:38:45,656 --> 00:38:47,590
as per that National Trade Union
has been established

227
00:38:48,192 --> 00:38:51,252
As per that Supervisors pressurized
Coal Mines Oweners

228
00:38:51,562 --> 00:38:53,223
and Ramadheer Singh was the
Leader of that movement

229
00:38:55,266 --> 00:38:57,325
This trade union has become a
face of Mafia

230
00:38:58,135 --> 00:39:00,035
Union Leader has become contractors

231
00:39:00,304 --> 00:39:02,966
and they were raising funds to make
other labours to their workers

232
00:39:03,808 --> 00:39:05,571
They gave money on interest

233
00:39:06,043 --> 00:39:07,977
and they keep their salaries
for interest

234
00:39:11,415 --> 00:39:12,609
New contractors came one by one

235
00:39:14,719 --> 00:39:16,653
He has become politican and
won the election

236
00:39:34,672 --> 00:39:36,799
My dad run coal mines for
many years

237
00:39:40,878 --> 00:39:44,644
I know how contractors and labours
stealing coal and sell in black markets

238
00:39:45,449 --> 00:39:46,711
I won't let this black
marketting happen

239
00:39:47,551 --> 00:39:49,382
My profit should be great

240
00:39:51,722 --> 00:39:54,020
Coal is a great thing

241
00:39:55,826 --> 00:39:56,952
It looks like stone

242
00:39:57,928 --> 00:40:00,761
but it's not think like stone

243
00:40:01,799 --> 00:40:02,493
it's light weighted

244
00:40:03,167 --> 00:40:07,729
if you will put it into water

245
00:40:11,041 --> 00:40:12,599
now it will be dry

246
00:40:13,244 --> 00:40:14,336
and it will become

247
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:16,944
heavy

248
00:40:20,017 --> 00:40:20,949
16 Tons...

249
00:40:28,759 --> 00:40:30,021
you are facing many injustices

250
00:40:31,095 --> 00:40:33,996
Our union...

251
00:40:38,469 --> 00:40:39,299
And how it's happening

252
00:40:40,571 --> 00:40:42,129
It's all happening under Chief...

253
00:40:52,283 --> 00:40:53,272
I have told you

254
00:40:53,918 --> 00:40:55,783
that my share should be same
like other contractors

255
00:40:55,953 --> 00:40:57,716
I am sending the stuff as per
your demand

256
00:40:58,956 --> 00:41:00,389
It's going...

257
00:41:02,593 --> 00:41:03,924
but it's not reaching there.

258
00:41:04,261 --> 00:41:06,058
Until S.P. Sinha will alive

259
00:41:06,831 --> 00:41:09,891
till then nor we will eat something
neither we will have house

260
00:41:10,367 --> 00:41:11,698
What do you think?

261
00:41:12,736 --> 00:41:15,227
S.P. Sinha is just educated

262
00:41:15,906 --> 00:41:17,703
he is writing in his office

263
00:41:18,042 --> 00:41:19,566
How do he know how people
are stealing

264
00:41:20,411 --> 00:41:22,606
We don't have food to eat

265
00:41:23,047 --> 00:41:24,912
and he is gardening outside
his house

266
00:41:25,149 --> 00:41:26,514
You shouldn't break the flower

267
00:41:26,684 --> 00:41:27,708
just play with it

268
00:41:47,505 --> 00:41:48,802
What was under S.P. Sinha

269
00:41:49,573 --> 00:41:51,734
Ramadher Singh has become contractor
from Owner

270
00:41:52,409 --> 00:41:55,810
And after killing S.P. Sinha
Ramadheer's terror has increased

271
00:41:58,482 --> 00:42:00,279
Your father was a big man

272
00:42:12,162 --> 00:42:13,094
Where is Sardar Khan?

273
00:42:15,199 --> 00:42:17,429
Sardar khan came here

274
00:42:39,256 --> 00:42:41,520
She says that she is Nagma

275
00:42:41,892 --> 00:42:44,019
She said I am Nagma

276
00:42:44,194 --> 00:42:45,889
and you think she is Nagma

277
00:42:48,032 --> 00:42:49,294
I didn't found out

278
00:42:55,906 --> 00:42:56,838
I was drunk

279
00:42:57,107 --> 00:42:58,597
She took advantage of me

280
00:43:01,345 --> 00:43:02,835
What are you doing?
She will die

281
00:43:03,013 --> 00:43:04,037
Let her die

282
00:43:11,088 --> 00:43:13,056
I won't spare you alive

283
00:43:17,962 --> 00:43:19,657
I will see you later

284
00:43:22,900 --> 00:43:24,299
Where are you running?

285
00:43:29,073 --> 00:43:31,598
Some day you will come home

286
00:44:59,096 --> 00:45:00,120
Please forgive me

287
00:45:02,633 --> 00:45:04,601
What is it?
I don't know

288
00:45:05,102 --> 00:45:06,626
What is it?

289
00:45:08,739 --> 00:45:10,138
Nothing could happen right now

290
00:45:12,342 --> 00:45:14,071
Somebody is inside my womb

291
00:45:14,511 --> 00:45:15,978
So I am not taking him out

292
00:45:17,614 --> 00:45:18,774
Don't you ashame?

293
00:45:19,817 --> 00:45:21,808
You will make your kid dirty

294
00:45:22,286 --> 00:45:23,446
This is not right...

295
00:45:23,921 --> 00:45:26,185
When somebody is already inside

296
00:45:26,623 --> 00:45:28,614
So you should control your self

297
00:55:04,334 --> 00:55:05,995
Rama Heer Singh recognized Sardar

298
00:55:06,569 --> 00:55:07,365
Perhaps not me,

299
00:55:08,004 --> 00:55:09,904
Besides he saw me with Shahid

300
00:55:12,909 --> 00:55:13,876
It was a time...

301
00:55:14,144 --> 00:55:15,771
when big people forget their names

302
00:55:16,246 --> 00:55:18,009
but they never forget their land...

303
00:55:19,683 --> 00:55:21,241
Where it's written that this
land is yours...

304
00:55:22,285 --> 00:55:23,616
If it's your land then show me
the papers

305
00:55:24,921 --> 00:55:25,979
Land is mine

306
00:55:27,157 --> 00:55:27,919
I have already made a deal

307
00:55:29,859 --> 00:55:31,656
And what you are trying to occupied

308
00:55:32,629 --> 00:55:33,459
It won't be good for you

309
00:55:33,930 --> 00:55:35,329
Think and speak!

310
00:55:35,999 --> 00:55:37,796
Don't tell me the differences

311
00:55:38,301 --> 00:55:39,563
Here's the land papers

312
00:55:40,704 --> 00:55:42,001
I have bought it for Rs. 10

313
00:55:44,174 --> 00:55:47,143
Do you know what's your value?

314
00:55:55,385 --> 00:55:57,478
If you will keep sitting on your chair
then it will be good for everyone

315
00:56:11,501 --> 00:56:12,627
You don't know who am I?

316
00:56:19,442 --> 00:56:20,670
You don't know who am I?

317
00:56:22,011 --> 00:56:24,844
When you go back to home and
itching your father's ass...

318
00:56:25,482 --> 00:56:26,676
then ask him who am I?

319
00:56:29,753 --> 00:56:33,245
How many days I will be imprisoned
to slap a minister in police station

320
00:56:51,941 --> 00:56:52,703
Start the car!

321
00:57:01,284 --> 00:57:03,479
You will appoint anyone without
any information

322
00:57:05,922 --> 00:57:07,617
I didn't know...

323
00:57:07,924 --> 00:57:10,324
Look! Everyone look your minister
has been beaten up

324
00:57:12,562 --> 00:57:14,860
What are you doing?
Why are you beating him?

325
00:57:15,031 --> 00:57:16,658
If you will interfere then I will
slit your throat

326
00:57:27,343 --> 00:57:31,507
I have beaten up Minister
in S. P's office

327
00:57:32,515 --> 00:57:34,312
In front of his father

328
00:57:35,685 --> 00:57:37,710
My name is Sardar Khan

329
00:57:38,188 --> 00:57:39,712
Tell everyone

330
00:58:05,682 --> 00:58:08,014
Last night I saw a nightmare

331
00:58:12,088 --> 00:58:13,146
Do you remember Shahid Khan?

332
00:58:22,098 --> 00:58:23,360
He came to your dreams

333
00:58:27,237 --> 00:58:27,965
his son

334
00:58:29,405 --> 00:58:30,963
His son's ghost came to my dream

335
00:58:33,276 --> 00:58:34,834
Whom you have killed and buried

336
00:58:37,080 --> 00:58:37,774
Where did you buried him?

337
00:58:45,655 --> 00:58:47,452
Do you remember?

338
00:58:51,461 --> 00:58:53,656
Go there!

339
00:58:55,231 --> 00:58:57,722
And dig that place and bring
his bones

340
00:59:00,270 --> 00:59:01,737
Priest was saying that...

341
00:59:03,540 --> 00:59:04,666
His body is still alive

342
00:59:05,475 --> 00:59:07,204
And he is scaring me

343
00:59:12,815 --> 00:59:14,510
Now tell me the truth

344
00:59:16,786 --> 00:59:18,583
Otherwise I will kill you
and bury there

345
00:59:22,825 --> 00:59:23,951
I made a mistake

346
00:59:28,498 --> 00:59:30,796
Your mistake will create a scene

347
00:59:37,974 --> 00:59:39,498
He is Pappu

348
00:59:40,677 --> 00:59:41,336
from Punjab

349
00:59:42,779 --> 00:59:44,007
He is expert to make bombs

350
00:59:52,555 --> 00:59:53,783
Will you make bomb?
I will...

351
00:59:55,325 --> 00:59:56,155
What do you need?

352
00:59:58,394 --> 00:59:59,258
I will need Sulpher
And...

353
00:59:59,896 --> 01:00:01,659
Coal powder,
Will you make it?

354
01:00:05,101 --> 01:00:05,829
Where?

355
01:00:06,436 --> 01:00:07,061
To give food

356
01:00:07,370 --> 01:00:08,530
Who?
To my dad

357
01:00:10,640 --> 01:00:12,073
What did I told you?
Why are you beating me?

358
01:00:13,443 --> 01:00:14,102
Do it properly

359
01:00:16,646 --> 01:00:18,807
Why?
I'm going to give food to my dad

360
01:00:22,885 --> 01:00:26,218
Are you my son or your dad's son
where your father used to go

361
01:00:27,290 --> 01:00:29,190
I am Sardar Khan's son

362
01:00:35,031 --> 01:00:36,555
What?
Food!

363
01:00:37,100 --> 01:00:37,498
Open it!

364
01:01:39,062 --> 01:01:40,154
How much time it will take

365
01:01:41,631 --> 01:01:42,996
I am making bomb not tea

366
01:01:43,332 --> 01:01:44,026
It will take time

367
01:01:44,901 --> 01:01:46,095
Celebrate your next eid here

368
01:02:03,886 --> 01:02:06,184
Tie it fast

369
01:02:06,756 --> 01:02:08,724
I will have to tie it tight

370
01:03:11,454 --> 01:03:13,012
Make it fast

371
01:03:18,694 --> 01:03:19,388
He is coming

372
01:03:28,171 --> 01:03:29,138
Give me the gun

373
01:03:41,584 --> 01:03:42,380
Come fast Pappu!

374
01:03:44,086 --> 01:03:45,280
Throw the bomb on the wall

375
01:03:47,356 --> 01:03:48,789
It didn't blown up

376
01:04:57,326 --> 01:04:59,590
Few people doesn't teach anything
to their women

377
01:05:03,432 --> 01:05:05,900
Some day butchers will see her then
they will rape her

378
01:05:06,836 --> 01:05:07,894
But what she is doing here?

379
01:05:08,638 --> 01:05:09,696
Sultan brought her up here

380
01:05:12,441 --> 01:05:13,499
She stood in mosque last night

381
01:05:14,377 --> 01:05:15,139
She came here

382
01:16:01,356 --> 01:16:02,914
Wait!

383
01:16:13,936 --> 01:16:15,198
Until I am alive

384
01:16:15,671 --> 01:16:17,605
You will have never pay for ice cream

385
01:16:19,908 --> 01:16:20,499
Who is that?

386
01:16:24,780 --> 01:16:26,680
Uncle!
Show me the picture

387
01:16:40,495 --> 01:16:42,986
Qureshi were ruled in Wasseypur
from Sultana dacoit's time

388
01:16:43,732 --> 01:16:44,858
It was sultana that time

389
01:16:45,167 --> 01:16:45,861
Now it is Sultan

390
01:16:46,802 --> 01:16:49,202
And Sultan's Butcher Goon can
do anything here

391
01:16:49,905 --> 01:16:51,463
They kidnapped any woman

392
01:16:51,773 --> 01:16:52,535
They does anything

393
01:16:53,208 --> 01:16:55,039
with whom other muslims were scared

394
01:16:57,479 --> 01:17:00,209
Qamar Makhdoom has decided to
get them their rights

395
01:17:00,515 --> 01:17:02,210
But Qureshis made fun of him

396
01:17:17,899 --> 01:17:19,491
What's the matter?
Nowadays you came to get by yourself

397
01:17:20,035 --> 01:17:20,899
You don't order at your home

398
01:17:25,173 --> 01:17:26,105
I want to meet Sultan

399
01:17:32,981 --> 01:17:35,006
Sultan is the son of Sultana dacoit's
daughter's son

400
01:17:35,651 --> 01:17:37,551
whom Ehsan Qureshi has grown up
at his home

401
01:17:38,453 --> 01:17:41,149
He chopped the buffalo when he
was 12

402
01:17:41,890 --> 01:17:43,824
And still today he chopped 60 buffalos

403
01:17:44,393 --> 01:17:45,621
that's why others are scared from him

404
01:17:46,795 --> 01:17:47,955
What we do about these Qureshis?

405
01:17:49,064 --> 01:17:49,860
We tried to explain them

406
01:17:50,632 --> 01:17:52,293
We requested them

407
01:17:52,934 --> 01:17:54,060
But they don't care

408
01:17:57,472 --> 01:17:59,133
Everyone knew about your
dad's legendary

409
01:18:00,642 --> 01:18:01,666
Now you just come back

410
01:18:02,644 --> 01:18:04,441
That house was empty in neighbourhood

411
01:18:05,013 --> 01:18:05,911
We all have bought it

412
01:18:06,548 --> 01:18:08,015
now Sultan has occupied that house

413
01:18:09,518 --> 01:18:10,815
His goons gamble all day long there

414
01:18:11,153 --> 01:18:11,778
They drink beer

415
01:18:12,387 --> 01:18:13,479
They kidnapped a woman
in night

416
01:18:13,822 --> 01:18:14,447
What we do now?

417
01:18:31,873 --> 01:18:32,430
Let's go!

418
01:18:39,715 --> 01:18:41,114
How do I go college?

419
01:18:41,616 --> 01:18:43,208
He stood there everyday

420
01:18:43,885 --> 01:18:46,285
If I change the lane so he
came from anywhere

421
01:18:47,122 --> 01:18:50,387
He looks at me like no man has
seen a woman

422
01:18:51,593 --> 01:18:52,719
It seems that he will eat me

423
01:18:54,362 --> 01:18:56,262
He is a Pehelwan of Dhanbad

424
01:18:56,898 --> 01:18:59,128
If you will kill him in Wasseypur
then there is no problem

425
01:19:00,669 --> 01:19:02,159
He must J. P Singh's man

426
01:19:02,838 --> 01:19:04,271
Now if we will do something...

427
01:19:04,406 --> 01:19:05,873
then it will are will know

428
01:19:15,751 --> 01:19:17,013
How are you?

429
01:20:19,247 --> 01:20:19,645
Is he dead?

430
01:20:20,182 --> 01:20:21,149
Not dead?

431
01:20:27,589 --> 01:20:29,921
Sardar lived in Wassepur for 1 year
after the jailbreak

432
01:20:30,625 --> 01:20:31,751
He killed Pehelwan there

433
01:20:32,394 --> 01:20:33,361
J.P. Singh's Pehelwan

434
01:20:33,929 --> 01:20:35,453
whom nobody has touched yet

435
01:20:36,598 --> 01:20:38,122
Wasseypur was muslim's area

436
01:20:40,368 --> 01:20:42,996
He chopped his body and threw
it to every Slaughter house

437
01:20:44,372 --> 01:20:46,533
Qureshi's had contract of
Bhau Jee Street

438
01:20:47,075 --> 01:20:49,168
and Qamar Makhdoom was not favourite
of Qureshis...

439
01:20:49,811 --> 01:20:51,972
That girl was not belong to Qureshi

440
01:20:52,514 --> 01:20:53,378
besides that Qureshi did't said
anything

441
01:20:55,550 --> 01:20:57,916
And their Sardar Sultan remains quite

442
01:20:59,654 --> 01:21:00,814
Emergency was over

443
01:21:01,189 --> 01:21:02,281
It was 80's...

444
01:21:02,924 --> 01:21:04,585
and Wassepur has become Dhanbad

445
01:21:05,227 --> 01:21:06,592
where Sardar was living two lives

446
01:21:06,995 --> 01:21:09,520
One house in Wasseypur where
Qureshis were his enemies

447
01:21:09,931 --> 01:21:12,422
Seond house is in Dhanbad where
Ramadheer Singh was his enemy

448
01:21:13,168 --> 01:21:14,795
There was only one advantage to
live in Wasseypur

449
01:21:15,237 --> 01:21:16,568
that police never came to this area

450
01:21:28,016 --> 01:21:28,846
Why did you came here?

451
01:21:29,951 --> 01:21:31,384
This is Wasseypur

452
01:21:34,923 --> 01:21:38,290
Sardar Khan killed Pehelwan
in Dhanbad

453
01:21:38,894 --> 01:21:40,293
I thought he is here

454
01:21:41,363 --> 01:21:43,729
When Sardar will come in markets

455
01:21:44,199 --> 01:21:45,131
then you shall catch him

456
01:21:47,068 --> 01:21:48,092
This is Wasseypur

457
01:21:48,803 --> 01:21:51,237
Here pigeon fly with one wing

458
01:21:51,640 --> 01:21:53,505
and save his respect from
another wing

459
01:22:01,816 --> 01:22:02,578
I have proof!

460
01:22:17,332 --> 01:22:18,731
I have brought cycle material

461
01:22:20,635 --> 01:22:22,762
Cycle's pipe is weak and it will
not explode properly

462
01:22:26,207 --> 01:22:26,935
So what should I bring?

463
01:22:27,175 --> 01:22:28,233
Truck's steering pipe

464
01:22:28,510 --> 01:22:30,307
How much pipe I will have to bring

465
01:22:35,583 --> 01:22:36,413
What is the range?

466
01:22:38,186 --> 01:22:39,118
How much?

467
01:22:42,390 --> 01:22:45,018
From which distance I will shoot and
man will be hurted

468
01:22:46,494 --> 01:22:47,722
It will shoot till 20 feets

469
01:23:15,156 --> 01:23:16,384
What did you made?

470
01:23:16,958 --> 01:23:18,186
It shakes my hand

471
01:23:18,493 --> 01:23:20,017
I shot in Qasai Market and it
goes to Calcutta

472
01:23:20,328 --> 01:23:21,795
Do you think I am a fool?

473
01:25:45,373 --> 01:25:45,964
Who was that?

474
01:25:46,741 --> 01:25:48,072
What was that?
Sardar Khan!

475
01:25:49,477 --> 01:25:50,603
Everyone was gone to mourne

476
01:25:51,246 --> 01:25:52,270
I was sleeping upstairs

477
01:25:52,680 --> 01:25:53,647
I am not feeling well today

478
01:25:54,082 --> 01:25:55,413
I heard a blast...

479
01:25:56,284 --> 01:25:58,946
When I came out

480
01:25:59,354 --> 01:26:02,323
I have seen everywhere...

481
01:26:09,898 --> 01:26:10,523
We should kill him

482
01:26:16,604 --> 01:26:20,165
And Sardar has become so famous

483
01:26:20,508 --> 01:26:21,440
that he has forgotten

484
01:26:21,910 --> 01:26:25,368
that his wife and sons are
still alive...

485
01:26:32,955 --> 01:26:33,979
Shall I turn off the light

486
01:26:35,557 --> 01:26:36,182
Let it be...

487
01:26:37,292 --> 01:26:37,986
I will turn it off

488
01:27:16,098 --> 01:27:17,429
They are not scared

489
01:27:20,836 --> 01:27:22,133
They are waiting

490
01:27:27,142 --> 01:27:28,769
They watch and attack

491
01:27:31,213 --> 01:27:32,043
What happen?

492
01:27:32,914 --> 01:27:35,610
Doctor has stopped me,
Doctor doesn't know anything

493
01:27:46,762 --> 01:27:47,751
So what should I do?

494
01:28:07,916 --> 01:28:09,076
Good excuse!

495
01:28:12,020 --> 01:28:13,578
Like I wanted to do it

496
01:28:14,089 --> 01:28:16,182
God left your child in my womb

497
01:28:16,458 --> 01:28:19,222
My mom didn't had 4 kids,
You are taking revenge of that

498
01:28:19,461 --> 01:28:20,257
I am not taking revenge

499
01:28:20,429 --> 01:28:22,158
You really enjoy to born the kid

500
01:28:22,597 --> 01:28:24,030
When you stay at home?

501
01:28:24,366 --> 01:28:25,628
You have no time,

502
01:28:28,870 --> 01:28:30,770
If I will bring another wife?
What do you mean?

503
01:28:31,306 --> 01:28:33,365
Like I don't know about your affair

504
01:28:37,112 --> 01:28:38,773
Did you make her pregnant?

505
01:28:43,518 --> 01:28:44,849
Why are you staring at me?

506
01:29:04,940 --> 01:29:06,305
I am leaving

507
01:29:08,844 --> 01:29:09,572
Give me the keys

508
01:29:12,047 --> 01:29:13,036
Where are you going?

509
01:29:27,162 --> 01:29:28,129
It's me Sardar!

510
01:29:30,932 --> 01:29:32,194
Where you have been?

511
01:29:38,573 --> 01:29:39,631
You stay here!
I am coming

512
01:29:44,346 --> 01:29:45,711
What happen?

513
01:29:46,648 --> 01:29:47,672
You are feeling pain

514
01:29:53,955 --> 01:29:54,819
Leave me!

515
01:30:02,931 --> 01:30:03,420
Enough!

516
01:30:04,266 --> 01:30:05,130
Will you kill me?

517
01:30:07,169 --> 01:30:07,999
What happen?

518
01:30:28,823 --> 01:30:30,518
What you have done with me?

519
01:30:34,062 --> 01:30:35,996
You have tied me here

520
01:30:36,698 --> 01:30:38,757
Why are you cursing me?

521
01:30:47,042 --> 01:30:51,172
I don't want to be child making machine

522
01:30:52,614 --> 01:30:53,945
So who is making?

523
01:30:54,950 --> 01:30:56,975
So what is this?

524
01:30:58,386 --> 01:30:59,819
This is love

525
01:31:20,475 --> 01:31:21,339
Where is your mom?

526
01:31:22,444 --> 01:31:24,435
She is conscious...
Is it boy or girl?

527
01:31:25,247 --> 01:31:25,838
Boy!

528
01:31:26,948 --> 01:31:27,846
So smile!

529
01:31:30,685 --> 01:31:31,413
Do you need money?

530
01:31:36,725 --> 01:31:37,783
You don't want to meet mom

531
01:31:39,828 --> 01:31:41,022
Now she is conscious so what
it worths...

532
01:31:41,830 --> 01:31:43,229
Tell her that I came in new shirt

533
01:32:45,660 --> 01:32:47,560
Your dad has stopped sending money

534
01:32:50,198 --> 01:32:51,859
Find a job and earn some money

535
01:33:03,311 --> 01:33:05,472
Tell me where are you going?

536
01:33:12,487 --> 01:33:13,613
Who you are going to kill?

537
01:33:38,780 --> 01:33:39,542
What?

538
01:33:57,265 --> 01:33:58,129
How much you got?

539
01:33:59,067 --> 01:34:00,261
20 rupees
That's it

540
01:34:01,403 --> 01:34:02,631
You will give 10 rupees to mom

541
01:34:03,071 --> 01:34:05,232
I will give whole money to mom

542
01:34:10,011 --> 01:34:10,943
Did you recognize me?

543
01:34:12,147 --> 01:34:14,012
What?
Ramadheer!

544
01:34:15,116 --> 01:34:16,048
Come I will drop you home

545
01:34:19,053 --> 01:34:20,543
Since when your dad didn't come home

546
01:34:23,491 --> 01:34:24,287
A year!

547
01:34:25,894 --> 01:34:26,622
Or more than a year

548
01:34:28,163 --> 01:34:29,824
He earns millions

549
01:34:30,732 --> 01:34:32,723
and he spend his money to that
woman and his sons

550
01:34:34,402 --> 01:34:37,530
You both are cleaning train toilets
instead of going school

551
01:34:39,240 --> 01:34:40,138
Don't you feel angry?

552
01:34:51,886 --> 01:34:53,353
It's 1000 rupees.
Keep it

553
01:34:57,192 --> 01:34:58,284
Tell your mom

554
01:34:59,327 --> 01:35:02,023
Ramadheer is with her

555
01:35:10,104 --> 01:35:12,800
Who gave you?
Ramadheer Singh gave me

556
01:35:13,241 --> 01:35:15,004
He said if you need more money then
come and get it

557
01:35:15,577 --> 01:35:16,566
He gave you and you keep it

558
01:35:16,978 --> 01:35:19,139
Are you a beggar?
Is your dad died?

559
01:35:19,414 --> 01:35:22,008
Why dad doesn't come home?
Why he doesn't send money

560
01:35:23,485 --> 01:35:25,680
Now you want to kill him

561
01:35:30,758 --> 01:35:31,554
Why did you get the money?

562
01:35:31,693 --> 01:35:33,251
So what if your dad doesn't
come home

563
01:35:34,896 --> 01:35:37,194
You are roaming with his respect

564
01:35:41,536 --> 01:35:43,663
You take money from Ramadheer Singh?

565
01:35:58,453 --> 01:36:00,045
Don't rub it!

566
01:36:01,022 --> 01:36:02,046
I am not injured

567
01:47:33,147 --> 01:47:36,708
Get some automatic guns,
You will get everything

568
01:47:38,786 --> 01:47:39,775
Learn something from him

569
01:47:41,322 --> 01:47:43,916
He doesn't have anything to do

570
01:47:44,959 --> 01:47:46,085
Go and help your mom

571
01:47:48,028 --> 01:47:50,496
Time has come that steeling coal
was a small business

572
01:47:51,432 --> 01:47:55,334
Coal Labour has started their small
business

573
01:47:55,836 --> 01:47:57,303
Big business was Contractorship

574
01:47:58,138 --> 01:48:00,834
Rather it's a wood contract

575
01:48:04,278 --> 01:48:07,509
It has written 32 trucks rate
So 32 truck is parked there

576
01:48:08,482 --> 01:48:09,915
Where it is?
Look over there

577
01:48:11,719 --> 01:48:14,085
that's only one,
That's the 32nd truck...

578
01:48:15,256 --> 01:48:16,723
I have to fill entire mine

579
01:48:17,091 --> 01:48:18,422
Otherwise land will be collapse

580
01:48:25,132 --> 01:48:27,930
We have started sand near lake

581
01:48:28,469 --> 01:48:31,267
Sardar got the contract to fill the
mine with land

582
01:48:31,605 --> 01:48:34,165
And Sardar has become a king
of Wasseypur

583
01:48:34,908 --> 01:48:37,775
After killing Qureshis and blown up
their houses...

584
01:48:38,078 --> 01:48:40,342
Sardar has removed them
from Wasseypur

585
01:48:40,481 --> 01:48:43,450
and he started iron business with
Asghar

586
01:48:43,951 --> 01:48:47,216
Coal chapter has become history
for Dhanwaad Mafia

587
01:48:52,926 --> 01:48:56,293
Old Machines tendor is coming
for factories

588
01:49:00,834 --> 01:49:01,892
He grown up!

589
01:49:12,279 --> 01:49:13,246
Will you work with us?

590
01:49:16,583 --> 01:49:17,845
Put him on some job

591
01:50:09,436 --> 01:50:11,495
Make a line and everyone will
get money

592
01:50:12,306 --> 01:50:13,671
if someone is not in the line so
don't give him the money

593
01:50:16,610 --> 01:50:17,838
How is your mom?

594
01:50:19,513 --> 01:50:20,810
Where is your brother?

595
01:50:21,515 --> 01:50:23,380
I want to tell you something

596
01:50:26,153 --> 01:50:28,747
Come home!
I would...

597
01:50:29,723 --> 01:50:30,985
but I am scared from your mom

598
01:50:32,359 --> 01:50:34,759
Ramadheer couldn't harm me

599
01:50:35,562 --> 01:50:36,824
but if his mom wants...

600
01:50:37,498 --> 01:50:41,434
So she can fry my liver

601
01:50:53,480 --> 01:50:54,708
Bring the gun

602
01:50:59,186 --> 01:51:00,653
Why you didn't keep the gun here?

603
01:51:07,561 --> 01:51:08,493
He is been shot

604
01:51:09,863 --> 01:51:10,795
I am fine!

605
01:51:11,565 --> 01:51:12,497
Bring the jeep

606
01:51:13,400 --> 01:51:15,300
I am fine
You are not fine

607
01:51:19,039 --> 01:51:20,529
Get him up!

608
01:51:28,282 --> 01:51:29,544
Nothing happened to me

609
01:51:36,457 --> 01:51:37,082
Where is the key?

610
01:51:40,327 --> 01:51:42,192
You have put the keys in your ass

611
01:51:45,899 --> 01:51:46,695
Where is the key?

612
01:51:47,835 --> 01:51:49,496
You had the keys

613
01:51:51,472 --> 01:51:53,372
My son has been shot
Check him!

614
01:51:55,609 --> 01:51:56,371
He is standing here

615
01:52:03,116 --> 01:52:04,481
you are not doing right

616
01:52:08,155 --> 01:52:10,282
He won't lay down from himself,
If he will die...

617
01:52:12,426 --> 01:52:13,358
What is this?

618
01:52:14,695 --> 01:52:16,322
Remove your shirt!

619
01:52:20,567 --> 01:52:21,829
I think electicity is gone

620
01:52:24,171 --> 01:52:25,138
Now nothing can happen in dark

621
01:52:28,242 --> 01:52:29,869
So what if electricity is gone,

622
01:52:31,211 --> 01:52:33,111
There is no tube light in my ass

623
01:52:33,514 --> 01:52:34,913
Nothing will happen in dark,
Everything will gone wrong

624
01:52:37,451 --> 01:52:38,418
Operate him!

625
01:52:40,487 --> 01:52:41,215
Where is Danish?

626
01:52:41,989 --> 01:52:43,957
He is in operation theatre...
how he is?

627
01:52:44,758 --> 01:52:45,622
Go and seee...

628
01:53:50,557 --> 01:53:51,683
What happen?

629
01:54:01,969 --> 01:54:04,597
Now I will have to give you invitation
card to get down

630
01:54:20,687 --> 01:54:22,052
That car is parked over there...
Yes!

631
01:54:22,356 --> 01:54:23,448
Open it's every part

632
01:54:25,292 --> 01:54:27,556
We are just making your car in pieces

633
01:54:29,096 --> 01:54:31,155
If something would happen to my son

634
01:54:32,532 --> 01:54:33,999
then I would fire so many bullets

635
01:54:34,401 --> 01:54:35,698
that your driver...

636
01:54:35,936 --> 01:54:37,369
would become rich to sell
bullet holes

637
01:54:39,706 --> 01:54:40,468
Are you enjoying?

638
01:54:47,381 --> 01:54:49,406
Smell him and tell what he
got in breakfast?

639
01:54:55,288 --> 01:54:56,380
Wife's thrash
What?

640
01:54:57,924 --> 01:54:58,481
This is not good

641
01:55:11,672 --> 01:55:12,764
What's the problem?

642
01:55:13,240 --> 01:55:15,208
You live on one floor and she
will live on another floor

643
01:55:15,909 --> 01:55:17,536
If you want you can make
seperate kitchen

644
01:55:37,964 --> 01:55:39,454
Do you want your daddy?
Yes!

645
01:55:48,709 --> 01:55:49,539
Let's do one thing

646
01:55:50,644 --> 01:55:52,009
I will make you in two pieces

647
01:55:53,013 --> 01:55:53,980
I will have one leg

648
01:55:54,347 --> 01:55:55,211
and she will have another leg

649
01:56:15,902 --> 01:56:16,834
Get lost from here

650
01:56:18,004 --> 01:56:19,596
You won't come.
Never!

651
01:56:23,210 --> 01:56:23,938
Fine!

652
01:56:26,513 --> 01:56:27,639
I will come later

653
01:56:30,817 --> 01:56:33,149
Where is daddy?
In hell...

654
01:56:35,288 --> 01:56:36,516
Give your right to someone else...

655
02:07:35,948 --> 02:07:37,381
I am getting married next month

656
02:07:38,117 --> 02:07:39,744
We are waiting for your releasing order

657
02:07:40,720 --> 02:07:41,482

02:07:55,101 --> 02:07:57,069

663
02:08:00,339 --> 02:08:01,271

664
02:09:48,481 --> 02:09:50,346
I met your old friends in jail

665
02:09:54,220 --> 02:09:56,245
Last time when dad send

666
02:09:56,889 --> 02:09:57,981
so I didn't understand...

667
02:09:59,892 --> 02:10:01,189
that why a gun of 150,000

668
02:10:02,328 --> 02:10:05,820
would be sold so cheap
it should be expensive

669
02:10:09,902 --> 02:10:11,426
Money is there!

I will stop the train for your pee

675
02:11:33,719 --> 02:11:34,378

Amitach Bachchan joined police force
in Zanjeer

695
02:27:58,069 --> 02:27:59,229
because he wanted to take revenge

696
02:28:00,205 --> 02:28:01,229

Do you understand?

700
02:28:15,320 --> 02:28:16,150
Where are you going?

701
02:28:18,289 --> 02:28:19,620
