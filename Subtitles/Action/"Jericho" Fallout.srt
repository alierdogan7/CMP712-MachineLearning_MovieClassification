1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,100
Previously on Jericho...

2
00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:02,320
Jake Green!

3
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:03,840
How you doing, man?

4
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:04,220
Wait a minute.

5
00:00:04,220 --> 00:00:06,170
--Where the hell you been?
--Around.

6
00:00:06,550 --> 00:00:08,730
Jake, no one's been around for five years.

7
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:11,380
Seriously, where have you been?

8
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:13,300
Hey, brother.

9
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:14,670
What you put this family through...

10
00:00:14,676 --> 00:00:16,372
--Johnston, for God's sake.
--Now, he could have been...

11
00:00:16,372 --> 00:00:18,825
We could spend a week talking
about what I could have been, all right?

12
00:00:18,824 --> 00:00:21,996
--I've apologized, but I need my
money to make a clean start.
--It's not your money.

13
00:00:21,998 --> 00:00:23,306
It's your grandfather's money.

14
00:00:23,437 --> 00:00:26,880
--Stay one more day.
--I've got to get back to San Diego by tomorrow.

15
00:00:34,786 --> 00:00:37,642
All right, it looks like the explosion came
from the west, maybe Denver.

16
00:00:37,857 --> 00:00:39,022
Did something happen?

17
00:00:39,057 --> 00:00:39,952
Are we under attack?

18
00:00:40,228 --> 00:00:42,830
Hi, Dale. Sorry I didn't call
sooner, angel, but we...

19
00:00:42,835 --> 00:00:44,761
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

20
00:00:46,718 --> 00:00:48,972
Sheriff? Robert Hawkins.

21
00:00:48,975 --> 00:00:50,132
I am so sorry.

22
00:00:50,336 --> 00:00:53,292
--I didn't know your mother was in Denver.
--She wasn't in Denver.

23
00:00:53,297 --> 00:00:54,571
She was in Atlanta.

24
00:00:54,576 --> 00:00:55,402
Oh, my God!

25
00:00:55,646 --> 00:00:57,552
Look, I know you're telling people
it was an accident

26
00:00:57,566 --> 00:00:59,450
but if it was an attack, Sheriff

27
00:00:59,588 --> 00:01:01,310
and there's chaos out there,

28
00:01:01,508 --> 00:01:02,950
you might not want the wrong people knowing

29
00:01:02,957 --> 00:01:04,363
that Jericho is still here.

30
00:01:04,368 --> 00:01:05,450
It's the wrong bus!

31
00:01:06,796 --> 00:01:07,530
Riley!

32
00:01:09,268 --> 00:01:11,041
Get April.
We'll meet you at the medical center.

33
00:01:11,047 --> 00:01:12,612
There's an empty prison bus out there.

34
00:01:12,857 --> 00:01:15,271
--What's your name?
--Heather.

35
00:01:16,408 --> 00:01:17,420
Nice to meet you, Jake.

36
00:01:17,428 --> 00:01:20,702
--It's a great thing you did t there tonight.
--Thanks.

37
00:01:20,708 --> 00:01:23,273
Something happened in Denver, Atlanta,

38
00:01:23,408 --> 00:01:25,083
and it could be that we wake up

39
00:01:25,086 --> 00:01:26,873
and we find out that's where it stopped.

40
00:01:27,226 --> 00:01:28,191
But, until we know,

41
00:01:28,545 --> 00:01:31,441
are we going to use our imaginations
to solve problems

42
00:01:31,446 --> 00:01:32,451
or to cause them?

43
00:02:18,488 --> 00:02:21,372
--Is there any sign of the sheriff, Mr. Hawkins?
--No, sir.

44
00:02:22,345 --> 00:02:23,981
I need to speak to your mayor.

45
00:02:25,376 --> 00:02:26,812
We got trouble coming.

46
00:02:45,248 --> 00:02:46,570
Oh, my God.

47
00:02:49,325 --> 00:02:50,532
Mom, where's April?

48
00:02:50,696 --> 00:02:52,612
--Jake, where have you been?
--Where is she?

49
00:02:52,848 --> 00:02:53,831
She's down the hall.

50
00:02:54,117 --> 00:02:56,800
--What's going on?
--Get Dad on the radio.

51
00:02:59,275 --> 00:03:00,800
You'll be fairly mobile on it.

52
00:03:00,945 --> 00:03:02,122
How do you feel?

53
00:03:03,118 --> 00:03:04,671
I feel like a badass.

54
00:03:05,107 --> 00:03:09,192
--April, does the clinic have a fallout shelter?
--Yes. What's going on?

55
00:03:09,196 --> 00:03:10,480
It's bad. Come on.

56
00:03:12,428 --> 00:03:14,650
Jericho has two underground shelters,

57
00:03:14,657 --> 00:03:16,453
one right here under the Town Hall

58
00:03:16,456 --> 00:03:17,663
the other under the medical clinic

59
00:03:17,667 --> 00:03:19,521
What about basements and storm cellars?

60
00:03:19,525 --> 00:03:20,763
They're better than nothing

61
00:03:20,826 --> 00:03:22,323
but you've got to seal off
the rest of the house

62
00:03:22,327 --> 00:03:25,370
with, uh... duct tape, plastic sheeting,

63
00:03:25,705 --> 00:03:27,291
anything you can get your hands on.

64
00:03:28,228 --> 00:03:30,382
How do you know about radiation, Mr. Hawkins?

65
00:03:31,056 --> 00:03:32,632
Because I was a cop in Saint Louis

66
00:03:32,636 --> 00:03:35,082
and, after 9-11, we got up to speed.

67
00:03:36,516 --> 00:03:38,420
So our biggest problem could be the rain.

68
00:03:39,417 --> 00:03:41,781
Won't the rain clear the radiation out of the air?

69
00:03:42,217 --> 00:03:44,513
Yes, and bring it straight down on Jericho--

70
00:03:44,887 --> 00:03:46,523
a direct, concentrated hit.

71
00:03:46,525 --> 00:03:48,312
Anyone exposed too long...

72
00:03:52,395 --> 00:03:53,982
Mr. Mayor? Sir?

73
00:03:55,778 --> 00:03:56,162
All right, look.

74
00:03:56,166 --> 00:03:58,372
We're gonna divide the town in two.

75
00:03:59,065 --> 00:04:01,550
Everyone over here can go
to the Town Hall shelter

76
00:04:02,008 --> 00:04:03,751
all those on the north side will
go to the clinic

77
00:04:03,757 --> 00:04:04,871
We'll get the word out, Dad.

78
00:04:04,876 --> 00:04:08,550
--How long before the radiation gets here?
--Oh, I'm new here.

79
00:04:08,806 --> 00:04:09,552
This is your town.

80
00:04:09,558 --> 00:04:11,883
How long does it normally take
a storm to get here from Denver?

81
00:04:11,887 --> 00:04:14,053
--Less than two hours.
--Sounds right.

82
00:04:14,058 --> 00:04:14,941
Two hours?

83
00:04:14,946 --> 00:04:17,392
--We can't do that in two hours.
--Not enough time.

84
00:04:17,825 --> 00:04:19,072
We've got work to do, guys.

85
00:04:39,607 --> 00:04:42,020
Jake  and I used to play down
here when we were kids.

86
00:04:42,027 --> 00:04:44,501
I don't think anyone's
been down here in ten years.

87
00:04:50,015 --> 00:04:53,443
--How many people can we fit in here?
--300.

88
00:04:53,907 --> 00:04:57,001
You do know that there's almost
5,000 people in this town.

89
00:04:57,008 --> 00:04:58,370
--Eric?
--Yeah?

90
00:04:58,798 --> 00:05:00,570
Make sure all the people
that have basements use them.

91
00:05:00,577 --> 00:05:03,720
--We are not running out of room
here today. You understand?
--Got it, Dad.
Jimmy!

92
00:05:15,408 --> 00:05:18,521
When was the last time someone was in here?

93
00:05:23,337 --> 00:05:24,581
You're kidding me.

94
00:05:27,745 --> 00:05:29,522
I can't put people in here.

95
00:05:29,745 --> 00:05:30,793
There's no air.

96
00:05:30,817 --> 00:05:31,873
There's no air in here.

97
00:05:32,578 --> 00:05:34,013
I hope the fan works.

98
00:05:35,227 --> 00:05:36,660
We got a lot of work to do.

99
00:05:50,228 --> 00:05:51,952
Wait, wait! Hey, hey!

100
00:06:08,858 --> 00:06:11,690
Oh, thank God. I haven't seen anybody for hours.

101
00:06:11,696 --> 00:06:12,770
I ran out of gas.

102
00:06:13,327 --> 00:06:15,643
--There's dead birds all over the road.
--Yeah, we saw them, too.

103
00:06:15,645 --> 00:06:17,143
They must have flown through the radiation.

104
00:06:18,997 --> 00:06:19,922
What radiation?

105
00:06:20,798 --> 00:06:21,860
There was a mushroom cloud.

106
00:06:21,956 --> 00:06:23,153
Somebody nuked us.

107
00:06:25,177 --> 00:06:26,353
Oh, my God.

108
00:06:29,167 --> 00:06:31,013
Look, Miss, we're running low on gas.

109
00:06:31,016 --> 00:06:32,600
Do you know if there's
a gas station nearby?

110
00:06:32,607 --> 00:06:33,780
Well, what do you think it is?

111
00:06:33,875 --> 00:06:36,480
--Do you think it's an accident or...?
--Ma'am, we don't know yet.

112
00:06:37,486 --> 00:06:38,231
Okay.

113
00:06:38,395 --> 00:06:39,371
Did it come from Wichita,

114
00:06:39,377 --> 00:06:41,551
--because my fiance, he's flying in from...
--No, no. Wrong direction.

115
00:06:41,555 --> 00:06:42,751
It looked more like Denver.

116
00:06:45,645 --> 00:06:47,043
Look, we need gas.

117
00:06:47,207 --> 00:06:51,761
--Do you know if there is a gas station nearby?
--Uh... yeah. No.

118
00:06:51,987 --> 00:06:52,942
No, the pumps are...

119
00:06:52,947 --> 00:06:53,790
They don't work.

120
00:06:53,796 --> 00:06:55,120
They've all been abandoned.

121
00:06:57,217 --> 00:06:58,722
No, we could... We could try
the Richmond Ranch.

122
00:06:58,726 --> 00:07:00,692
--I think they might have gas there.
--Then get in.

123
00:07:00,698 --> 00:07:01,422
We'll take you there.

124
00:07:05,435 --> 00:07:06,331
Miss?

125
00:07:07,127 --> 00:07:09,693
It's  okay. Get in.

126
00:07:35,815 --> 00:07:36,553
Dale?

127
00:07:37,145 --> 00:07:38,032
Wake up.

128
00:07:40,417 --> 00:07:41,680
Wake up, angel.

129
00:07:44,916 --> 00:07:45,770
Mom?

130
00:07:52,605 --> 00:07:55,290
Don't you remember what happened last night?

131
00:07:56,407 --> 00:07:57,570
Your mom's gone.

132
00:08:03,846 --> 00:08:07,791
Gracie? Come on, Gracie!
Open up!

133
00:08:07,997 --> 00:08:10,802
Gracie, we need to stock the shelters with food!

134
00:08:13,766 --> 00:08:15,510
Attention! Attention!

135
00:08:16,337 --> 00:08:20,002
There is radioactive fallout
coming from the nuclear blast.

136
00:08:20,697 --> 00:08:23,000
You have less than 90 minutes to get indoors

137
00:08:23,008 --> 00:08:27,230
I repeat, you have less than 90 minutes to get indoors.

138
00:08:27,826 --> 00:08:29,260
Use your basements.

139
00:08:29,498 --> 00:08:32,532
Use duct tape or other tape to seal your home.

140
00:08:32,877 --> 00:08:34,790
You have less than 90 minutes.

141
00:08:35,376 --> 00:08:37,523
You can go to the shelter at Town Hall

142
00:08:37,527 --> 00:08:39,541
or the shelter at the medical center.

143
00:08:39,545 --> 00:08:42,103
There is radioactive fallout coming.

144
00:08:42,102 --> 00:08:44,895
You have 90 minutes to get yourselves indoors.

145
00:08:44,894 --> 00:08:46,406
We are indoors!

146
00:08:49,288 --> 00:08:51,236
You're not from around here, are you?

147
00:08:52,418 --> 00:08:55,992
I came from D.C. to supervise
a little audit on a farm.

148
00:08:57,385 --> 00:08:58,711
Is God punishing me?

149
00:08:59,416 --> 00:09:01,713
Look, you really should get
to the basement at Town Hall.

150
00:09:02,297 --> 00:09:03,380
You think?

151
00:09:03,807 --> 00:09:06,072
--Jake, I'm not going anywhere.
--Mom...

152
00:09:06,077 --> 00:09:08,430
Mom, I'm not going to argue with you.

153
00:09:08,667 --> 00:09:11,001
--Go to the other shelter.
--I'm staying.

154
00:09:11,007 --> 00:09:13,182
Mom,  I don't even know if we can fix it

155
00:09:13,187 --> 00:09:15,110
and I can't concentrate knowing you're here.

156
00:09:15,467 --> 00:09:16,671
Please, I'll be fine.

157
00:09:17,157 --> 00:09:18,173
I'll be fine.

158
00:09:20,196 --> 00:09:22,060
Promise me you'll come to the shelter

159
00:09:22,068 --> 00:09:23,413
after it's fixed.

160
00:09:24,745 --> 00:09:26,082
Promise me.

161
00:09:26,797 --> 00:09:27,883
I promise, Mom.

162
00:09:32,167 --> 00:09:33,922
I want my boys with me.

163
00:09:35,577 --> 00:09:36,580
Okay, go.

164
00:09:37,488 --> 00:09:38,302
Please.

165
00:09:43,765 --> 00:09:45,643
Frank! Quit messing with the TV.

166
00:09:45,645 --> 00:09:47,852
I don't want to waste my generator on static.

167
00:09:48,197 --> 00:09:52,953
--Mary, what are these people still doing here?
--They won't go.

168
00:09:53,295 --> 00:09:55,233
I can't leave these clowns in my bar.

169
00:09:56,298 --> 00:09:57,432
All right, listen up.

170
00:09:58,608 --> 00:10:00,822
Radiation's on its way from Denver.

171
00:10:01,057 --> 00:10:01,911
If you don't have a basement,

172
00:10:02,037 --> 00:10:03,351
you need to get to Town Hall.

173
00:10:03,868 --> 00:10:04,871
There's a shelter there.

174
00:10:04,875 --> 00:10:06,503
I'm not going to Town Hall.

175
00:10:08,566 --> 00:10:10,953
Well, you don't have a choice, people.

176
00:10:11,157 --> 00:10:12,481
You're being evacuated.

177
00:10:12,815 --> 00:10:14,023
And who are you?

178
00:10:15,115 --> 00:10:16,560
I'm the deputy mayor.

179
00:10:20,077 --> 00:10:22,371
What, did your daddy make you a deputy?

180
00:10:24,387 --> 00:10:25,202
Just forget it, Eric,

181
00:10:25,208 --> 00:10:26,440
you've told everybody.

182
00:10:30,386 --> 00:10:34,000
--Do you realize a nuclear bomb went off yesterday?
--So?

183
00:10:34,468 --> 00:10:36,843
If I'm going to die in a nuclear blast, so be it.

184
00:10:37,305 --> 00:10:38,461
I'm going to be right here

185
00:10:38,976 --> 00:10:40,681
playing pool with my buddies.

186
00:10:41,698 --> 00:10:43,293
But you're not going to die in a blast.

187
00:10:45,315 --> 00:10:47,423
You're going to get radiation poisoning.

188
00:10:49,887 --> 00:10:51,523
Within the first couple of hours

189
00:10:52,536 --> 00:10:53,582
you're going to be vomiting

190
00:10:53,786 --> 00:10:55,530
and have crippling diarrhea.

191
00:10:56,625 --> 00:10:58,502
Your hair is going to fall out in chunks.

192
00:10:58,998 --> 00:10:59,890
Your skin,

193
00:11:00,325 --> 00:11:01,490
it's going to blister.

194
00:11:02,638 --> 00:11:05,240
Your internal organs are going to start to shut down.

195
00:11:06,218 --> 00:11:08,040
Because, well, frankly...

196
00:11:09,405 --> 00:11:11,732
...they're being cooked from the inside.

197
00:11:12,316 --> 00:11:14,063
You're going to get sicker and sicker

198
00:11:14,316 --> 00:11:15,453
until you can't move.

199
00:11:17,296 --> 00:11:18,442
And then you will die.

200
00:11:21,096 --> 00:11:23,310
Over there on the floor by the pool table...

201
00:11:23,885 --> 00:11:24,820
with your buddies.

202
00:11:45,995 --> 00:11:47,121
Ooh.

203
00:11:47,655 --> 00:11:48,661
Don't mind me.

204
00:12:15,055 --> 00:12:15,953
Sit tight.

205
00:12:16,235 --> 00:12:17,433
We'll be right back.

206
00:12:36,848 --> 00:12:37,493
Sheriff, come in.

207
00:12:37,497 --> 00:12:39,023
Come in, Sheriff, over.

208
00:12:39,315 --> 00:12:41,791
Randall, no one's heard from the sheriff
since last night

209
00:12:41,797 --> 00:12:43,482
There was a prison bus out there.

210
00:12:43,488 --> 00:12:45,490
I think we better assume the worst.

211
00:12:45,496 --> 00:12:46,322
You're on your own.

212
00:12:46,767 --> 00:12:48,091
What about Jimmy or Bill?

213
00:12:48,877 --> 00:12:49,881
Deputies are missing, too.

214
00:12:49,886 --> 00:12:51,663
You're  just going to have
to handle this yourself.

215
00:12:55,908 --> 00:12:57,693
Don't think we forgot you, did you?

216
00:13:03,845 --> 00:13:06,611
--Anything wrong, Miss?
--No, nothing.

217
00:13:07,615 --> 00:13:08,793
Doesn't look like anybody's here.

218
00:13:08,795 --> 00:13:11,081
Yeah, well, the pump's locked, so...

219
00:13:11,666 --> 00:13:13,832
You know, there is this other place
that I can take you to.

220
00:13:13,836 --> 00:13:15,942
Look, we're running on fumes as it is.

221
00:13:26,966 --> 00:13:29,392
Make a sound, you die.

222
00:13:31,375 --> 00:13:32,103
I'm sorry, sir,

223
00:13:32,105 --> 00:13:33,773
I don't think anybody's home.

224
00:13:39,567 --> 00:13:40,421
Ms. Sullivan...

225
00:13:40,425 --> 00:13:42,591
--What a surprise.
--Hey, Bonnie.

226
00:13:53,806 --> 00:13:55,410
Oxygen tanks, IVs,

227
00:13:55,486 --> 00:13:58,140
all non-electrical medical supplies.

228
00:13:58,567 --> 00:14:00,820
--When was that written?
--1957.

229
00:14:00,827 --> 00:14:02,882
The population of Jericho was 1,000 people.

230
00:14:03,246 --> 00:14:04,421
I'll start moving everyone.

231
00:14:04,428 --> 00:14:06,510
I'll get the ventilation system fixed.

232
00:14:09,618 --> 00:14:11,522
God, they chewed through everything.

233
00:14:11,705 --> 00:14:12,670
Mind if I pitch in?

234
00:14:13,146 --> 00:14:14,820
You know how to strip wires?

235
00:14:15,216 --> 00:14:16,573
Ever since junior high.

236
00:14:18,378 --> 00:14:19,773
Yeah, I was that popular.

237
00:14:20,408 --> 00:14:21,462
All right, great.

238
00:14:22,005 --> 00:14:22,700
Check the fan belt,

239
00:14:22,705 --> 00:14:23,741
I think it's frayed.

240
00:14:23,907 --> 00:14:25,543
Well, then you might want to get another one.

241
00:14:26,448 --> 00:14:29,440
Any mid-century American car would
be a good match.

242
00:14:29,448 --> 00:14:30,702
And check the brushers.

243
00:14:30,708 --> 00:14:32,250
--We don't want the motor to seize up.
--Okay.

244
00:14:32,256 --> 00:14:33,160
All right.

245
00:14:33,947 --> 00:14:35,192
You take over.

246
00:14:35,506 --> 00:14:36,780
I'll  look for a fan belt.

247
00:14:41,266 --> 00:14:43,031
Excuse me, sir.

248
00:14:43,188 --> 00:14:44,352
You're doing that wrong.

249
00:14:47,368 --> 00:14:48,060
April.

250
00:14:48,748 --> 00:14:50,650
She thinks we shouldn't move the baby.

251
00:14:52,055 --> 00:14:55,750
Ma'am, your baby's protected
in this little bubble.

252
00:14:56,388 --> 00:14:58,451
She's got fresh air and food.

253
00:14:58,957 --> 00:15:01,001
Right now, she's the safest
person in Jericho

254
00:15:01,006 --> 00:15:01,922
but you're not.

255
00:15:02,707 --> 00:15:05,060
We need to make sure she has
a mother to take care of her

256
00:15:05,065 --> 00:15:08,260
when this thing is over, okay?

257
00:15:08,656 --> 00:15:09,551
Please.

258
00:15:10,525 --> 00:15:15,722
--Please, let us take you both
down to the shelter, okay?
--Mm-hmm.

259
00:15:15,728 --> 00:15:16,653
Okay.

260
00:15:20,945 --> 00:15:22,470
--Bobby.
--Jake Green?

261
00:15:22,477 --> 00:15:23,190
Just a second, ma'am.

262
00:15:23,198 --> 00:15:25,322
--obby, there's two in the nursery.
--I'm Emily Sullivan's aunt.

263
00:15:26,346 --> 00:15:29,191
...taken to the shelter in our basement.

264
00:15:29,195 --> 00:15:31,363
Mrs. Dawson, hi.

265
00:15:31,877 --> 00:15:34,600
--Have you seen Emily?
--No, not since yesterday.

266
00:15:34,606 --> 00:15:36,142
Maybe she's at the other shelter.

267
00:15:36,148 --> 00:15:37,542
No one over there has seen her

268
00:15:37,545 --> 00:15:39,361
and she's not at her house.

269
00:15:41,306 --> 00:15:42,520
I heard you were back in town

270
00:15:42,526 --> 00:15:44,912
--and I figured the one person who would know...
--I'm sorry.

271
00:15:45,688 --> 00:15:46,241
I have to go.

272
00:15:46,447 --> 00:15:47,980
If I see her, I'll tell her
you're looking for her

273
00:15:47,987 --> 00:15:49,102
but I'm sure she's fine.

274
00:15:58,297 --> 00:15:59,733
So we'll just, uh,

275
00:15:59,935 --> 00:16:01,912
use your pump and be on our way.

276
00:16:02,298 --> 00:16:03,580
Stanley has the key.

277
00:16:04,275 --> 00:16:05,333
What did she just say?

278
00:16:05,958 --> 00:16:07,682
Oh... her brother, Stanley,

279
00:16:07,688 --> 00:16:09,070
he's got the key to the pump.

280
00:16:09,508 --> 00:16:10,133
Wait a minute,

281
00:16:10,486 --> 00:16:12,971
--she's deaf?
--Yes.

282
00:16:15,308 --> 00:16:16,780
I read lips.

283
00:16:20,428 --> 00:16:22,873
--When do you think Stanley gets back?
--Another hour.

284
00:16:23,165 --> 00:16:24,763
--Whoa, whoa, whoa.
--What did she just say?

285
00:16:25,158 --> 00:16:26,393
It's going to be about an hour.

286
00:16:26,907 --> 00:16:30,640
Oh, we can wait an hour, can't we?

287
00:16:33,798 --> 00:16:36,351
Ms. Sullivan, you all right?

288
00:16:39,816 --> 00:16:40,860
Yeah, fine.

289
00:16:41,215 --> 00:16:42,300
I'm just hungry.

290
00:16:43,408 --> 00:16:44,260
Yeah, uh...

291
00:16:44,267 --> 00:16:47,723
Why don't we make some food for the officers?

292
00:16:48,548 --> 00:16:50,180
Oh, I want eggs.

293
00:16:50,615 --> 00:16:51,153
It's a farmhouse,

294
00:16:51,155 --> 00:16:52,361
you've got eggs, right?

295
00:16:54,516 --> 00:16:55,993
Yeah, why don't we, uh...

296
00:16:56,826 --> 00:16:58,222
Why don't we all go make something to eat?

297
00:16:59,318 --> 00:17:00,280
Sure.

298
00:17:08,327 --> 00:17:10,612
People south of Main
go to you at Town Hall?

299
00:17:10,616 --> 00:17:11,510
Yeah, that's right,

300
00:17:11,515 --> 00:17:14,320
all those to the north of Main Street
go to the medical center.

301
00:17:14,327 --> 00:17:17,332
--Johnston.
--Right, yeah, I know, you want me
to take it easy.

302
00:17:17,336 --> 00:17:21,420
--I'm just going to go help Eric
get the supplies from Gracie.
--I've already sent people to do that.

303
00:17:21,427 --> 00:17:23,803
Gail, who is in charge here, you or me?

304
00:17:24,415 --> 00:17:26,132
You do not want to play that game.

305
00:17:26,247 --> 00:17:29,670
Here's every book we have in the library
about nuclear radiation.

306
00:17:30,058 --> 00:17:32,551
--Our Friend The Atom.
--Some friend.

307
00:17:33,408 --> 00:17:34,923
Anything in here for grownups?

308
00:17:34,927 --> 00:17:36,232
I'd like to know what we're supposed to do

309
00:17:36,235 --> 00:17:37,320
if this town gets hit.

310
00:17:37,876 --> 00:17:39,392
None of the books are specific.

311
00:17:40,128 --> 00:17:43,321
Atom bombs have only gone off in
populated cities twice in history.

312
00:17:43,665 --> 00:17:46,002
And Denver was probably hit
by a hydrogen bomb, anyway.

313
00:17:46,348 --> 00:17:47,432
What's the difference?

314
00:17:47,486 --> 00:17:51,152
Hydrogen bombs, they literally
explode the air.

315
00:17:51,777 --> 00:17:55,501
So, what you're saying
is that nobody knows

316
00:17:55,505 --> 00:17:56,852
what's really coming?

317
00:17:58,827 --> 00:18:00,383
Then we pick worst case scenario.

318
00:18:00,387 --> 00:18:03,180
--What needs to be done?
--One second, sir, I have that.

319
00:18:03,257 --> 00:18:04,393
Let me just...

320
00:18:05,328 --> 00:18:08,792
Anything left outside
will have to be scrubbed down.

321
00:18:09,136 --> 00:18:12,750
And if it rains, the top
18 inches or so of soil

322
00:18:12,756 --> 00:18:15,213
will have to be removed before planting again.

323
00:18:15,218 --> 00:18:18,253
And tell everybody to cover
all the water wells.

324
00:18:19,255 --> 00:18:20,940
That's about what it says, right?

325
00:18:23,158 --> 00:18:25,101
Yes. Yes, that's right.

326
00:18:26,477 --> 00:18:27,993
Well, you heard the man.

327
00:18:27,998 --> 00:18:31,143
Jeff, let's make sure all the ranchers
get the livestock inside.

328
00:18:31,556 --> 00:18:33,431
I'm going to work on the radio.

329
00:18:33,927 --> 00:18:37,043
This may be our last chance
to make contact for a while.

330
00:18:37,546 --> 00:18:38,640
There's a bunch of people in the church.

331
00:18:38,648 --> 00:18:39,893
They held a vigil there all night.

332
00:18:39,898 --> 00:18:41,821
I'm going to make sure they get into shelter.

333
00:18:41,895 --> 00:18:45,012
--Hurry back.
--Yes, ma'am.

334
00:18:48,366 --> 00:18:51,010
--I'm telling you they need to be replaced.
--Listen, girlie...

335
00:18:51,016 --> 00:18:53,083
Please, don't argue with me.
don't tell me...

336
00:18:53,088 --> 00:18:54,540
The brushers are shot,

337
00:18:54,546 --> 00:18:56,091
it's revving too high. It's...

338
00:18:58,137 --> 00:18:58,953
Turn them off!

339
00:19:06,858 --> 00:19:08,330
Jake, everyone's ready.

340
00:19:08,556 --> 00:19:10,363
--What do we do now?
--Don't let them in here!

341
00:19:10,795 --> 00:19:12,421
The rain's going to be here soon.

342
00:19:12,427 --> 00:19:13,820
People are getting scared.

343
00:19:14,147 --> 00:19:15,623
Do we have air or not?

344
00:19:15,977 --> 00:19:17,753
You seal them up in here
they're going to die.

345
00:19:27,665 --> 00:19:28,673
Hello,Dad

346
00:19:29,387 --> 00:19:30,583
Dad, can you hear me?

347
00:19:31,527 --> 00:19:32,903
Dad's checking on the church, Jake

348
00:19:32,985 --> 00:19:33,743
What do you need?

349
00:19:34,135 --> 00:19:35,571
Our shelter's no good.

350
00:19:35,615 --> 00:19:37,250
I'm bringing these people to Town Hall.

351
00:19:37,255 --> 00:19:38,141
Whoa, whoa, hold on.

352
00:19:38,297 --> 00:19:40,613
Jake, I don't know how many more
people we can hold.

353
00:19:41,076 --> 00:19:43,613
--What about the basement?
--They don't have basements, Eric.

354
00:19:43,616 --> 00:19:44,700
That's why they came here.

355
00:19:45,328 --> 00:19:47,543
Eric, we've got 200 people here.

356
00:19:47,548 --> 00:19:49,732
Some of them need medical attention.

357
00:19:49,916 --> 00:19:50,962
Handle it.

358
00:19:51,368 --> 00:19:52,710
Look, I will be at Town Hall soon.

359
00:19:52,715 --> 00:19:54,492
I'll check to see how much room we have.

360
00:19:54,496 --> 00:19:57,580
--And I will call you back.
--I don't have time. We're coming.

361
00:19:57,956 --> 00:20:02,073
--Sorry, my husband needs a kick sometimes.
--You don't have to apologize to me.

362
00:20:06,897 --> 00:20:08,053
I've got to go to the shelter.

363
00:20:08,056 --> 00:20:09,373
Bring everything you can.

364
00:20:11,558 --> 00:20:13,192
H-How much more do you need?

365
00:20:13,736 --> 00:20:17,112
--Enough to feed half the town, Gracie.
--Half the town?

366
00:20:17,465 --> 00:20:18,240
Wait--

367
00:20:25,478 --> 00:20:29,031
--Skylar, you have to come to the shelter.
--I'm not going to some stupid shelter.

368
00:20:29,038 --> 00:20:30,600
I'm going home to wait for my parents.

369
00:20:30,785 --> 00:20:32,292
--Don't be crazy.
--I'm not crazy!

370
00:20:32,298 --> 00:20:33,902
--I'm going home.
--Fine.

371
00:20:33,907 --> 00:20:35,550
Excuse me, ladie

372
00:20:35,827 --> 00:20:37,420
Are you going to pay for those?

373
00:20:38,185 --> 00:20:38,973
What are you talking about?

374
00:20:38,975 --> 00:20:40,711
Everybody is just taking stuff.

375
00:20:40,716 --> 00:20:42,591
This is still my store.

376
00:20:42,906 --> 00:20:44,620
Is that for an emergency?

377
00:20:47,058 --> 00:20:48,242
All right, you know what?

378
00:20:49,058 --> 00:20:50,503
Fine, keep it.

379
00:20:52,686 --> 00:20:54,593
Her parents are in New York, okay?

380
00:20:54,596 --> 00:20:56,740
Who knows if they're even going to come back.

381
00:20:59,578 --> 00:21:03,431
--It was just a couple cans of soda.
--They're my soda.

382
00:21:13,356 --> 00:21:14,600
I say we head east.

383
00:21:14,717 --> 00:21:16,343
She was headed east, wasn't she?

384
00:21:17,395 --> 00:21:21,071
Hey, how far from here
would you say those crows were?

385
00:21:21,538 --> 00:21:24,030
About five miles west
from where you picked me up.

386
00:21:25,977 --> 00:21:27,302
Hell,  then we'll go north.

387
00:21:41,848 --> 00:21:42,470
Hey.

388
00:21:43,066 --> 00:21:44,950
You want to help me out with the coffee?

389
00:21:45,826 --> 00:21:47,542
Yeah, I'll show you where it is.

390
00:21:59,057 --> 00:22:00,260
You better get down to that shelter.

391
00:22:00,265 --> 00:22:02,870
--The wind is moving faster than we thought
--I'm watching it.

392
00:22:02,876 --> 00:22:04,700
Just get everybody underground.

393
00:22:06,267 --> 00:22:07,633
You know, if you get that thing to work,

394
00:22:07,638 --> 00:22:11,240
just do me a favor, and find
out who did this to us.

395
00:22:32,538 --> 00:22:34,921
--Eric, come in.
--This is Eric, go ahead.

396
00:22:34,925 --> 00:22:37,412
A couple of busloads coming to Town Hall.

397
00:22:50,206 --> 00:22:51,383
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

398
00:22:51,388 --> 00:22:52,580
People, please!

399
00:22:52,585 --> 00:22:53,600
Don't get off the bus.

400
00:22:53,605 --> 00:22:56,610
--We can't take any more.
--Eric, what the hell are you doing?

401
00:22:56,928 --> 00:22:57,872
They can't come in here, Jake.

402
00:22:57,876 --> 00:22:59,333
--What do you mean they can't come in here?
--We're packed!

403
00:22:59,337 --> 00:23:01,912
What? I got a whole bus full of
people here that need shelter.

404
00:23:01,918 --> 00:23:04,262
You're really gonna turn away
all these people, Eric?

405
00:23:04,265 --> 00:23:05,821
You're going to turn away your wife?

406
00:23:06,278 --> 00:23:07,630
We let everybody in,

407
00:23:07,638 --> 00:23:08,982
we'll all suffocate.

408
00:23:09,126 --> 00:23:11,002
Eric, there are really sick people here

409
00:23:11,008 --> 00:23:12,530
and the storm is coming!

410
00:23:12,538 --> 00:23:13,692
Okay, we can take ten.

411
00:23:14,877 --> 00:23:16,201
And I saved a spot for you.

412
00:23:17,287 --> 00:23:19,263
All right, the ten most critical, fast.

413
00:23:19,265 --> 00:23:21,890
Gray, the salt mine,
how many people will it hold?

414
00:23:21,898 --> 00:23:22,912
As many as you want,

415
00:23:22,916 --> 00:23:25,292
--but I don't think...
--It has a ventilation system, right?

416
00:23:25,557 --> 00:23:29,511
--Yeah, and water.
--All right, it's the best option
we have right now, all right?

417
00:23:29,795 --> 00:23:30,291
Mom?

418
00:23:30,295 --> 00:23:31,651
Have you seen your father?

419
00:23:31,815 --> 00:23:33,773
He told me he was going to the church.

420
00:23:33,838 --> 00:23:37,160
Well, Gail, people from that church got
back 20 minutes ago.

421
00:23:38,038 --> 00:23:38,772
Eric?

422
00:23:39,248 --> 00:23:40,580
Mom, we'll find Dad.

423
00:23:40,587 --> 00:23:44,492
--Jake, take your people to the mine.
Leave us 10.
--I'll go with you, Jake.

424
00:23:45,185 --> 00:23:48,010
After 27 years, nobody knows
that mine the way I do.

425
00:23:48,285 --> 00:23:50,072
I guess you can fit 11 people now.

426
00:23:51,485 --> 00:23:52,423
Yeah, make it 12.

427
00:23:52,975 --> 00:23:53,950
It's my place--

428
00:23:54,195 --> 00:23:55,173
I should be there.

429
00:23:55,937 --> 00:23:57,260
Yeah, let's go.

430
00:23:59,995 --> 00:24:00,812
Hey.

431
00:24:01,876 --> 00:24:03,162
We're going to be okay.

432
00:24:15,666 --> 00:24:16,452
Hang on.

433
00:24:26,877 --> 00:24:30,111
--That smells good.
--Oh, no, no, I'll get it.

434
00:24:36,215 --> 00:24:37,163
Oh!

435
00:24:38,167 --> 00:24:40,703
--I am so sorry.
--Damn it.

436
00:24:40,708 --> 00:24:42,162
Oh, that looks bad.

437
00:24:42,168 --> 00:24:43,450
Look, go in the kitchen right now

438
00:24:43,456 --> 00:24:44,852
and run cold water over it.

439
00:24:44,855 --> 00:24:46,753
It'll stop it before the blisters.

440
00:24:47,176 --> 00:24:48,483
I'll clean up this mess.

441
00:24:55,896 --> 00:24:57,341
--What happened?
--She...

442
00:24:58,927 --> 00:24:59,943
I burnt my hand.

443
00:25:00,446 --> 00:25:01,370
You left her alone?

444
00:25:02,518 --> 00:25:03,690
She's fine.

445
00:25:12,525 --> 00:25:13,583
Is he okay?

446
00:25:14,947 --> 00:25:16,161
He'll live.

447
00:25:26,718 --> 00:25:29,470
I can only get 12 down
on the elevator at a time!

448
00:25:29,475 --> 00:25:30,871
That's the best I can do!

449
00:25:31,197 --> 00:25:33,310
Shep, we have to seal the entrance.

450
00:25:33,317 --> 00:25:34,320
There's no door, Jake.

451
00:25:34,447 --> 00:25:36,141
Well, we can't just let the rain
pour down the shaft.

452
00:25:36,146 --> 00:25:37,070
These people won't be safe.

453
00:25:37,077 --> 00:25:39,373
--We won't be safe.
--Well, how do we seal it?

454
00:25:39,478 --> 00:25:41,471
I don't know, but it's a mine.

455
00:25:41,756 --> 00:25:44,573
--You got dynamite, right?
--Whoa, whoa...

456
00:25:45,226 --> 00:25:48,830
--We put charges here, here, here...
--Are you crazy?

457
00:25:48,835 --> 00:25:51,613
How do we know we won't bring
the whole thing down on top of us?

458
00:25:52,668 --> 00:25:53,911
We don't.

459
00:26:53,287 --> 00:26:55,780
I am going to the little girls' room.

460
00:26:55,787 --> 00:26:59,211
--Hey, where is that?
--Right up the stairs.

461
00:26:59,218 --> 00:27:01,740
--Right there, see?
--Good to know.

462
00:27:12,768 --> 00:27:13,720
Straight back!

463
00:27:14,936 --> 00:27:18,132
--Eric, any sign of Dad?
--No, not yet.

464
00:27:18,325 --> 00:27:19,681
Checked the church, Main Street.

465
00:27:19,688 --> 00:27:21,621
We're going through every inch
of Town Hall right now.

466
00:27:22,237 --> 00:27:23,253
Listen, Eric,

467
00:27:23,497 --> 00:27:25,283
I'm going to need you
to bring a crew over here

468
00:27:25,288 --> 00:27:27,100
and dig us out when this thing's over.

469
00:27:27,108 --> 00:27:28,691
What? What? Why?

470
00:27:28,896 --> 00:27:30,831
--We're ready, Jake!
--Are you crazy?

471
00:27:30,836 --> 00:27:33,793
Just dig us out-- and find Dad, okay?

472
00:27:34,147 --> 00:27:35,070
Let's go.

473
00:28:10,425 --> 00:28:12,262
Mr. Hawkins, did my father come through here?

474
00:28:12,648 --> 00:28:13,932
No, I haven't seen him.

475
00:28:15,115 --> 00:28:18,233
--Mom, check the offices again.
--Maybe we missed something.

476
00:28:18,237 --> 00:28:19,473
I'll go check out the parking lot.

477
00:28:19,937 --> 00:28:24,241
--Look, we'll find him, okay?
--Okay. Be careful. Be careful.

478
00:28:28,856 --> 00:28:29,911
Could you use some help, ma'am?

479
00:28:30,216 --> 00:28:31,770
No, we need you on the radio.

480
00:28:32,016 --> 00:28:35,162
You know, I can't get this old thing to work.

481
00:28:36,175 --> 00:28:37,220
--Okay, come.
--Fine.

482
00:28:37,436 --> 00:28:38,330
Please.

483
00:29:12,716 --> 00:29:14,210
You are not in my house.

484
00:29:14,406 --> 00:29:16,392
Get off my property, right now.

485
00:29:16,396 --> 00:29:18,912
And my property goes all the way down the hill.

486
00:29:19,777 --> 00:29:20,812
You need to get back to town.

487
00:29:20,956 --> 00:29:22,633
The radiation's coming from Denver.

488
00:29:24,148 --> 00:29:25,040
I'm not leaving here.

489
00:29:25,048 --> 00:29:26,743
My parents are on their way back.

490
00:29:28,065 --> 00:29:30,751
--You talked to them?
--No, freak, the phones are dead.

491
00:29:30,758 --> 00:29:32,732
But I'm not leaving here without them.

492
00:29:34,086 --> 00:29:35,982
All right, stay inside,

493
00:29:35,987 --> 00:29:36,953
tape up the windows,

494
00:29:37,047 --> 00:29:38,251
and don't use the water.

495
00:29:39,357 --> 00:29:41,613
--Don't tell me what to do.
--I'm serious, Skylar.

496
00:29:41,615 --> 00:29:42,580
Stay inside.

497
00:29:50,907 --> 00:29:51,723
Dale?

498
00:29:51,975 --> 00:29:53,021
Dale, stop!

499
00:29:54,008 --> 00:29:54,931
Please.

500
00:29:59,416 --> 00:30:00,470
Stay here.

501
00:30:02,238 --> 00:30:03,542
It's not safe out there.

502
00:30:06,938 --> 00:30:08,370
Please stay here.

503
00:30:31,066 --> 00:30:32,321
Jody, where you at?

504
00:30:32,325 --> 00:30:33,131
All right, everybody...

505
00:30:33,137 --> 00:30:34,263
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa.

506
00:30:35,605 --> 00:30:37,041
Take some of that out, all right?

507
00:30:37,737 --> 00:30:39,721
Seal the entrance, not cause a cave-in.

508
00:30:41,148 --> 00:30:41,893
Hey.

509
00:30:42,348 --> 00:30:43,750
Where'd you learn how to do that?

510
00:30:44,548 --> 00:30:45,602
I knew a guy once.

511
00:30:46,427 --> 00:30:47,992
Did you blow him up?

512
00:31:01,288 --> 00:31:03,081
Hello? Is anyone here?

513
00:31:04,057 --> 00:31:06,171
--How does that look?
--It's good, that'll do.

514
00:31:07,296 --> 00:31:09,770
--How we coming, Gray?
--This is the last of 'em.

515
00:31:10,116 --> 00:31:12,222
--I'm almost done here.
--Same here.

516
00:31:12,658 --> 00:31:14,000
This is Emily Sullivan.

517
00:31:14,007 --> 00:31:16,021
We're at the Richmond Ranch with Bonnie.

518
00:31:17,118 --> 00:31:18,291
Please, help us.

519
00:31:20,665 --> 00:31:22,733
Can you hear me?
Is there anybody there?

520
00:31:22,818 --> 00:31:23,660
What was that?

521
00:31:24,167 --> 00:31:24,972
Did you hear that?

522
00:31:25,465 --> 00:31:26,970
--Somebody's on the radio.
--This is Emily Sullivan.

523
00:31:26,977 --> 00:31:29,221
--I'm at the Richmond Ranch.
--Everybody be quiet!

524
00:31:29,225 --> 00:31:30,283
There are men here with guns.

525
00:31:30,285 --> 00:31:33,191
I think they might have
killed the sheriff. Hello?

526
00:31:34,565 --> 00:31:35,423
Can you hear me?

527
00:31:38,408 --> 00:31:40,280
Emily! Emily!

528
00:31:42,428 --> 00:31:43,630
Emily, can you hear me?

529
00:31:44,258 --> 00:31:45,162
Emily.

530
00:31:45,198 --> 00:31:46,402
Come in, come in.

531
00:31:46,677 --> 00:31:47,763
Come in, can you hear me?

532
00:31:49,145 --> 00:31:50,501
Is there anyone out there?

533
00:31:56,536 --> 00:31:57,703
Is there anyone on this channel?

534
00:31:57,937 --> 00:31:58,940
Can anyone here me?

535
00:32:00,335 --> 00:32:01,681
Shep, give me your keys.

536
00:32:01,925 --> 00:32:05,251
--Jake, it's gonna start raining any minute now.
--Give me your keys, I can make it.

537
00:32:05,438 --> 00:32:07,423
--All right.
--Jake, you're out of your mind.

538
00:32:08,115 --> 00:32:10,600
Gray, get everybody down there, all right?

539
00:32:15,256 --> 00:32:16,531
--Hey, Jake?
--What?

540
00:32:22,717 --> 00:32:23,683
When everybody's down,

541
00:32:23,688 --> 00:32:24,761
say "all clear."

542
00:32:24,858 --> 00:32:26,731
"All clear," okay?

543
00:32:42,438 --> 00:32:44,523
Almost ready, Jake, stand by.

544
00:32:49,217 --> 00:32:50,300
Come on, come on.

545
00:32:53,108 --> 00:32:53,691
Jake?

546
00:32:54,478 --> 00:32:55,721
We're all clear.

547
00:33:03,075 --> 00:33:07,182
Johnston? Johnston?

548
00:33:15,007 --> 00:33:16,132
Gail...

549
00:33:22,336 --> 00:33:23,220
Oh, my God.

550
00:33:24,516 --> 00:33:25,641
Mr. Hawkins!

551
00:33:26,318 --> 00:33:27,593
Mr. Hawkins!

552
00:33:28,268 --> 00:33:29,593
Mr. Hawkins!

553
00:33:33,618 --> 00:33:34,750
Where's the brother?

554
00:33:41,045 --> 00:33:42,291
Where the hell's the girl?

555
00:33:47,415 --> 00:33:48,782
I think they might have killed...

556
00:33:48,995 --> 00:33:50,710
I think they might have killed the sheriffs.

557
00:34:04,446 --> 00:34:05,922
Please, help us.

558
00:34:21,488 --> 00:34:23,271
Hello. This is Emily Sullivan.

559
00:34:23,405 --> 00:34:25,680
I'm looking for the Jericho Police Department.

560
00:34:28,905 --> 00:34:29,591
Can you hear me?

561
00:34:29,597 --> 00:34:30,951
Is there anyone out there?

562
00:34:34,325 --> 00:34:35,713
Is there anybody on this channel?

563
00:34:36,096 --> 00:34:37,200
There are men here with guns.

564
00:34:37,208 --> 00:34:38,980
I think they might have killed the sheriff.

565
00:34:44,288 --> 00:34:45,562
Please, somebody help us.

566
00:34:54,088 --> 00:34:55,382
Run, Emily,

567
00:34:55,585 --> 00:34:56,362
run.

568
00:34:59,557 --> 00:35:01,230
Hey! Hey!

569
00:35:04,107 --> 00:35:04,561
Stop!

570
00:35:04,727 --> 00:35:05,501
Stop!

571
00:35:08,048 --> 00:35:09,850
Think this through! Let her go!

572
00:35:11,036 --> 00:35:11,652
No.

573
00:35:12,086 --> 00:35:13,482
We just want gas.

574
00:35:14,425 --> 00:35:16,361
Supplies, that's all this is about.

575
00:35:16,648 --> 00:35:18,202
It's just about fuel.

576
00:35:18,518 --> 00:35:20,072
Let her go.

577
00:35:22,976 --> 00:35:23,832
Look.

578
00:35:29,036 --> 00:35:31,260
Please, please, let her go.

579
00:35:33,478 --> 00:35:34,291
No.

580
00:35:34,385 --> 00:35:35,781
Is this what you want to see?

581
00:35:36,475 --> 00:35:38,221
Are you ready to talk now, Miss?

582
00:35:39,505 --> 00:35:40,842
Please, let her go.

583
00:36:11,846 --> 00:36:12,352
April...

584
00:36:12,616 --> 00:36:13,433
April, come here.

585
00:36:16,475 --> 00:36:18,212
Hey, Dad, can you tell me what happened?

586
00:36:18,218 --> 00:36:19,712
Sit down.
Here, sit him down.

587
00:36:19,855 --> 00:36:21,873
I just found him on the floor in his office.

588
00:36:24,286 --> 00:36:25,110
Did you hit your head?

589
00:36:26,666 --> 00:36:27,482
All right.

590
00:36:34,766 --> 00:36:36,702
Bonnie, take him to the storm cellar now!

591
00:36:36,708 --> 00:36:37,712
Go, guys, go!

592
00:36:38,885 --> 00:36:40,443
Emily, we've got to get inside.

593
00:36:42,308 --> 00:36:43,860
Emily? Emily, hey.

594
00:36:44,145 --> 00:36:45,161
It's going to be okay

595
00:36:45,576 --> 00:36:46,320
All right? I promise.

596
00:36:46,327 --> 00:36:48,440
Everything is going to be okay, all right?

597
00:36:48,448 --> 00:36:50,300
We've got to gin now, babe.

598
00:36:51,316 --> 00:36:51,973
Babe?

599
00:36:53,168 --> 00:36:56,110
We've got to get inside
before the rain, okay?

600
00:36:56,158 --> 00:36:57,171
Come with me.

601
00:36:57,888 --> 00:36:58,621
Come on.

602
00:36:59,065 --> 00:37:00,742
Run. Run.

603
00:37:04,308 --> 00:37:05,121
Get inside!

604
00:37:17,956 --> 00:37:21,143
--Hey, Dad.
--Hey. How you doing?

605
00:37:21,957 --> 00:37:22,891
You comfortable?

606
00:37:23,496 --> 00:37:24,890
Just like camping.

607
00:37:25,476 --> 00:37:26,802
You hate camping.

608
00:37:27,288 --> 00:37:28,210
Yep.

609
00:37:32,105 --> 00:37:33,271
Where's Allison?

610
00:37:34,017 --> 00:37:37,201
--She's up in her room.
--Samuel, go get Ali.

611
00:37:37,208 --> 00:37:38,253
Yes, sir.

612
00:37:43,278 --> 00:37:45,251
--Tell her I'm home.
--Yes, sir.

613
00:37:47,397 --> 00:37:48,842
Robert. Robert.

614
00:37:50,675 --> 00:37:52,983
--What's happening out there?
--I don't know.

615
00:37:53,676 --> 00:37:54,682
You know.

616
00:37:55,278 --> 00:37:57,032
--You always know something.
--Hey, hey...

617
00:37:57,926 --> 00:38:00,301
You are alive, Darcy,

618
00:38:00,615 --> 00:38:01,513
okay?

619
00:38:01,866 --> 00:38:03,141
And the kids are safe.

620
00:38:05,056 --> 00:38:07,011
You know, don't ask me questions.

621
00:38:39,038 --> 00:38:40,902
I think my mom died yesterday.

622
00:38:45,868 --> 00:38:48,550
I think my mom died yesterday, too.

623
00:39:13,198 --> 00:39:14,212
I thought you were gone.

624
00:39:17,348 --> 00:39:19,243
--Emily...
--Why are you here?

625
00:39:22,008 --> 00:39:23,330
Trying to keep you safe.

626
00:39:25,795 --> 00:39:27,430
It's never safe around you.
