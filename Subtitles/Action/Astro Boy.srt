1
00:01:27,446 --> 00:01:30,449
Here we are, floating
peacefully in the sky.

2
00:01:30,658 --> 00:01:33,077
Metro City,
the jewel in the crown.

3
00:01:33,786 --> 00:01:35,371
Beautiful, isn't it?

4
00:01:35,579 --> 00:01:37,373
But how did we get here?

5
00:01:37,873 --> 00:01:42,044
A century ago, the founders of Metro
City saw that our world was changing.

6
00:01:42,253 --> 00:01:45,130
They took Mount Sofia and
lifted it from the Earth...

7
00:01:45,339 --> 00:01:49,510
and into the sky, to be an oasis,
a floating paradise.

8
00:01:52,179 --> 00:01:54,265
We don't really know
what happens these days

9
00:01:54,473 --> 00:01:57,518
on the strange and mysterious
Surface we left behind.

10
00:01:57,726 --> 00:02:01,188
But life in Metro City
is better than ever, thanks to...

11
00:02:01,564 --> 00:02:03,357
our friends, the robots.

12
00:02:04,441 --> 00:02:06,068
Robots do our shopping.

13
00:02:07,403 --> 00:02:10,990
They cook for us and serve our meals.

14
00:02:11,282 --> 00:02:13,284
They take good care of us.

15
00:02:13,784 --> 00:02:15,870
They even do really
important things

16
00:02:16,078 --> 00:02:18,914
like remind us to call Mom
on her birthday.

17
00:02:19,415 --> 00:02:22,501
Whether it’s raising our kids,
building our buildings

18
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:26,213
taking care of our city, or
making sure we're all healthy...

19
00:02:26,589 --> 00:02:29,508
for these guys, no job is too big...

20
00:02:30,885 --> 00:02:32,344
or too small.

21
00:02:32,761 --> 00:02:35,639
Plus, robots do a lot
of things that, frankly...

22
00:02:35,848 --> 00:02:37,558
we just don't want to do anymore.

23
00:02:39,018 --> 00:02:39,685
Oh, no!

24
00:02:39,935 --> 00:02:42,938
Don't worry, folks,
that street will get clean.

25
00:02:43,731 --> 00:02:44,982
The best and brightest
of them get picked...

26
00:02:45,191 --> 00:02:46,650
for the more exciting tasks.

27
00:02:47,151 --> 00:02:49,612
This lucky guy is starting
the first day at his new job.

28
00:02:53,449 --> 00:02:57,077
And it’s all thanks to Dr. Tenma...

29
00:02:57,369 --> 00:02:58,996
Head of the Ministry of Science...

30
00:02:59,205 --> 00:03:00,998
and father of Modern Robotics.

31
00:03:01,290 --> 00:03:04,585
Thanks to him, life is easy
for us all in Metro City

32
00:03:04,793 --> 00:03:06,670
Toby, isn't that your dad?

33
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:07,963
It sure is.

34
00:03:09,131 --> 00:03:10,925
Our friends the robots help us.

35
00:03:11,509 --> 00:03:13,427
Thousands are created every day...

36
00:03:13,636 --> 00:03:15,012
and thousands are disposed of in the...

37
00:03:15,221 --> 00:03:19,308
great, unending cycle that sustains
life in our great city.

38
00:03:19,517 --> 00:03:23,187
Thanks for everything, guys.
May you rust in peace.

39
00:03:24,730 --> 00:03:26,941
Okay, students, ready for a pop quiz?

40
00:03:27,107 --> 00:03:28,150
What?

41
00:03:28,943 --> 00:03:30,277
Begin.

42
00:03:32,321 --> 00:03:34,448
I am so busted.

43
00:03:46,377 --> 00:03:48,254
Yes, Toby. Is there a problem?

44
00:03:48,462 --> 00:03:51,340
I'm just finished and
I'd like to leave.

45
00:03:51,632 --> 00:03:52,424
Finished?

46
00:03:52,633 --> 00:03:55,761
For rocket science,
it wasn't exactly rocket science.

47
00:03:56,095 --> 00:03:59,098
I don't suppose there's much
point in you staying.

48
00:04:00,307 --> 00:04:01,308
Good luck.

49
00:04:07,398 --> 00:04:08,774
Just like his father.

50
00:04:09,817 --> 00:04:12,403
Hello, Master Toby.
Did you have a good day at...

51
00:04:12,611 --> 00:04:13,737
Think fast, Orrin.

52
00:04:14,613 --> 00:04:17,950
Thank you, Master Toby.
Very good throw, by the way.

53
00:04:21,036 --> 00:04:22,872
- Hello, son.
- Hello, sir.

54
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:24,373
- How was school?
- Oh, great.

55
00:04:24,582 --> 00:04:26,208
Moustachio dropped a pop quiz on us...

56
00:04:26,417 --> 00:04:28,544
but I'm pretty sure I got 100%.

57
00:04:28,961 --> 00:04:33,090
That's good, but I don't want you
to become complacent.

58
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:37,178
You must keep studying.
Onward and upward.

59
00:04:37,678 --> 00:04:38,804
Sure, Dad.

60
00:04:40,764 --> 00:04:44,101
I know I said we'd go to
that symposium on quantum...

61
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:46,604
mechanics, but I have to take
a rain check again.

62
00:04:47,188 --> 00:04:48,439
But, you promised.

63
00:04:48,647 --> 00:04:51,025
I'm sorry, but it's unavoidable.

64
00:04:51,233 --> 00:04:52,902
President Stone has brought
forward the unveiling of...

65
00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:54,069
the Peacekeeper.

66
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:56,739
The Peacekeeper?
You've got to be kidding me!

67
00:04:56,906 --> 00:04:59,408
I never kid. Goodbye, son.

68
00:05:02,119 --> 00:05:03,621
The Peacekeeper?

69
00:05:03,829 --> 00:05:07,625
Orrin, change of plan.
Take me to the Ministry of Science.

70
00:05:07,833 --> 00:05:12,004
I'm sorry, Master Toby. Your
father gave me strict orders to...

71
00:05:12,630 --> 00:05:15,174
Stop that!
What are you doing back there?!

72
00:05:17,343 --> 00:05:19,678
Next stop, Ministry of Science.

73
00:05:29,271 --> 00:05:31,607
You ready to blow me
away today, Tenma?

74
00:05:31,816 --> 00:05:34,360
To make my hair stand up,
to knock my socks off?

75
00:05:34,568 --> 00:05:36,946
Metaphorically speaking, yes.

76
00:05:37,154 --> 00:05:38,697
That's the spirit.

77
00:05:39,490 --> 00:05:41,617
Dr. Elefun is an esteemed colleague
of mine, Mr. President.

78
00:05:41,826 --> 00:05:44,078
He may be resistant to having
his discovery used...

79
00:05:44,286 --> 00:05:45,412
for military purposes.

80
00:05:45,621 --> 00:05:47,623
You leave Dr. Elefun to me.

81
00:05:47,832 --> 00:05:49,416
- Dad!
- Hold that kid!

82
00:05:50,334 --> 00:05:53,254
Why are you here? I gave Orrin
specific instructions to...

83
00:05:55,422 --> 00:05:57,258
I wanted to see the demonstration.

84
00:05:57,466 --> 00:05:59,051
You always talk about
the Peacekeeper and...

85
00:05:59,260 --> 00:05:59,927
Really, Toby?

86
00:06:00,135 --> 00:06:02,054
- Your boy?
- Yes, sir.

87
00:06:02,304 --> 00:06:03,556
Let him tag along.

88
00:06:03,764 --> 00:06:04,974
Releasing potential threat.

89
00:06:05,182 --> 00:06:07,142
It'll be good for him. Educational.

90
00:06:07,434 --> 00:06:08,352
Yes, sir.

91
00:06:09,061 --> 00:06:12,648
You're interested in robots, son?
Robot weapons?

92
00:06:12,857 --> 00:06:16,360
Absolutely, though the latest
D-Class Interceptor...

93
00:06:16,569 --> 00:06:18,404
underlying
deployment-to-target system...

94
00:06:18,612 --> 00:06:19,655
is quite old-fashioned.

95
00:06:21,574 --> 00:06:23,409
Nobody likes a smarty-pants, kid.

96
00:06:23,617 --> 00:06:25,286
Take this boy to a safe place
and keep him there.

97
00:06:25,494 --> 00:06:26,162
What the...

98
00:06:26,704 --> 00:06:28,330
- Dad!
- I think it's for the best, Toby.

99
00:06:28,497 --> 00:06:30,249
But you said
I could see the Peacekeeper.

100
00:06:30,416 --> 00:06:34,170
You still can, on tonight's
news with everyone else.

101
00:06:35,004 --> 00:06:36,714
Ladies and gentlemen...

102
00:06:36,922 --> 00:06:40,593
allow me to present Blue Core energy.

103
00:06:41,093 --> 00:06:43,262
- Wow.
- Blue Core energy.

104
00:06:43,512 --> 00:06:46,140
A new self-sustaining power source...

105
00:06:46,348 --> 00:06:50,519
much stronger than nuclear energy,
and infinitely cleaner.

106
00:06:50,769 --> 00:06:52,938
The raw materials came from space.

107
00:06:53,189 --> 00:06:56,442
A fragment of a star millions
of light-years away...

108
00:06:56,650 --> 00:06:58,444
that no longer even exists.

109
00:06:58,652 --> 00:07:01,363
This is now all that's left of it.

110
00:07:01,572 --> 00:07:05,534
Properly harnessed,
this small sphere could transform...

111
00:07:05,743 --> 00:07:09,914
not only Metro City, but life
for those on the Surface as well.

112
00:07:14,168 --> 00:07:16,504
Imagine cleaning up Earth's water.

113
00:07:16,712 --> 00:07:18,839
Imagine bringing back
the forests. Imagine...

114
00:07:19,048 --> 00:07:21,675
overcoming the effects of
centuries of pollution.

115
00:07:21,884 --> 00:07:25,721
I know he's a bit of a dreamer,
but he's a brilliant scientist.

116
00:07:25,930 --> 00:07:28,807
He's a dangerous idiot who
happens to have a high I.Q.

117
00:07:29,016 --> 00:07:31,810
Unfortunately there's no such
thing as a free lunch.

118
00:07:32,019 --> 00:07:34,146
When we extracted
the positive blue energy...

119
00:07:34,355 --> 00:07:36,190
from the fragment,
we were left with...

120
00:07:36,398 --> 00:07:40,194
this highly unstable by-product,
negative red energy.

121
00:07:40,402 --> 00:07:41,320
Oh, I like that one.

122
00:07:41,654 --> 00:07:44,573
Women voters are partial
to the color red, you know.

123
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:48,118
Until we discover how to
safely dispose of it... What...

124
00:07:48,327 --> 00:07:49,870
What are you doing? Stop!

125
00:07:50,204 --> 00:07:52,790
Keep the cores apart
or you'll kill us all!

126
00:07:52,998 --> 00:07:54,291
Do as he says.

127
00:07:55,501 --> 00:07:58,712
This is outrageous!
What are you intending to do with it?

128
00:07:59,964 --> 00:08:03,259
I'm gonna give the people of
this city a reason to re-elect me.

129
00:08:03,467 --> 00:08:04,176
How?

130
00:08:04,385 --> 00:08:08,055
The only way you can.
I'm gonna kick some butt.

131
00:08:11,976 --> 00:08:13,477
This is so unfair.

132
00:08:13,769 --> 00:08:15,062
Cool off, hotshot.

133
00:08:15,437 --> 00:08:17,439
Please don't leave me in here!

134
00:08:17,648 --> 00:08:19,525
I can't stand small places.
Anywhere but here!

135
00:08:19,733 --> 00:08:23,529
You're 13 years old.
It's time you grew a backbone.

136
00:08:24,905 --> 00:08:28,075
Thanks for the life lesson,
and thank you for this.

137
00:08:28,242 --> 00:08:30,744
As one friend to another,
don't do this, Tenma.

138
00:08:30,953 --> 00:08:34,456
You know as well as I do,
without military funding...

139
00:08:34,665 --> 00:08:38,252
all of our research, including yours,
would grind to a halt.

140
00:08:38,752 --> 00:08:39,628
Start it up.

141
00:08:56,729 --> 00:09:00,065
I told President Stone,
"you gotta bring out the big guns."

142
00:09:00,274 --> 00:09:01,692
Onward and upward, Toby.

143
00:09:02,401 --> 00:09:03,694
Load the Blue Core.

144
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:15,831
Hold on. This Blue Core,
it's all sweetness and light, right?

145
00:09:16,165 --> 00:09:18,751
'Save the dolphins,'
"Give peace a chance,” and so forth?

146
00:09:18,918 --> 00:09:21,045
It's pure positive energy.

147
00:09:21,253 --> 00:09:23,631
Call me a dreamer,
but I think we'll get...

148
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:26,175
a bit more bang for our buck
using the red one.

149
00:09:27,551 --> 00:09:28,761
You're not joking?

150
00:09:28,969 --> 00:09:31,263
We're not putting something
that dangerous...

151
00:09:31,847 --> 00:09:33,849
into something that dangerous.

152
00:09:34,058 --> 00:09:36,727
I've got an election to win.

153
00:09:36,936 --> 00:09:40,064
I need my robot to be
a fighter, not a lover.

154
00:09:40,523 --> 00:09:41,899
Load the red one.

155
00:09:42,107 --> 00:09:42,775
I won't.

156
00:09:42,983 --> 00:09:45,402
Then I'll do it.
Move over, sweetheart.

157
00:09:45,611 --> 00:09:46,695
- Hey!
- No!

158
00:09:48,989 --> 00:09:50,991
It's like a video game.

159
00:09:58,290 --> 00:10:00,334
Core loaded.

160
00:10:01,001 --> 00:10:02,044
Piece of cake.

161
00:10:02,419 --> 00:10:03,963
Activate weapon drones.

162
00:10:11,053 --> 00:10:12,555
I hate this job.

163
00:10:15,349 --> 00:10:17,852
Whoa. I gotta get a better look.

164
00:10:18,227 --> 00:10:20,980
- Time to check the classifieds.
- I hear you.

165
00:10:27,570 --> 00:10:29,697
It's using that drone against
the other drones.

166
00:10:29,905 --> 00:10:30,781
How's that possible?

167
00:10:30,990 --> 00:10:32,241
It's called "adaptive technology."

168
00:10:32,449 --> 00:10:34,034
It can absorb and control anything.

169
00:10:34,243 --> 00:10:35,661
I may have flunked out of college...

170
00:10:35,870 --> 00:10:37,496
but I was right about the Red Core.

171
00:10:37,705 --> 00:10:40,416
You scientists think
you're the only ones with brains.

172
00:10:44,211 --> 00:10:44,879
Sir?

173
00:10:58,851 --> 00:10:59,727
Dad!

174
00:11:00,603 --> 00:11:01,395
Dad!

175
00:11:01,604 --> 00:11:02,271
- Toby!
- Dad!

176
00:11:03,564 --> 00:11:06,150
I can't open it!

177
00:11:07,276 --> 00:11:10,446
- Toby!
- Dad!

178
00:11:10,946 --> 00:11:12,156
It's going to be okay, Toby.

179
00:11:12,615 --> 00:11:13,908
I'm going to get you out!

180
00:11:14,909 --> 00:11:16,911
Everything's going to be fine,
I promise.

181
00:11:25,211 --> 00:11:26,128
Toby!

182
00:11:32,051 --> 00:11:32,843
Fire now!

183
00:12:02,873 --> 00:12:04,291
Where's Toby?

184
00:12:05,209 --> 00:12:06,836
Where's my son?

185
00:12:08,462 --> 00:12:10,673
I'm so sorry, Tenma.

186
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:21,892
Toby.

187
00:12:26,689 --> 00:12:28,190
It's all my fault.

188
00:14:07,456 --> 00:14:09,124
He hasn't eaten or slept for days.

189
00:14:09,333 --> 00:14:10,000
I know.

190
00:14:10,209 --> 00:14:11,544
He's gone crazy, hasn't he?

191
00:14:11,919 --> 00:14:15,422
If you lose your son like that
and you don't go crazy...

192
00:14:15,673 --> 00:14:17,216
you're not a human being.

193
00:14:18,008 --> 00:14:19,134
Clear the lab.

194
00:14:35,776 --> 00:14:40,865
It looks just like him, doesn't it?
A perfect replica.

195
00:14:41,282 --> 00:14:44,410
I've uploaded all of Toby's memories.

196
00:14:45,494 --> 00:14:46,370
It will think it is Toby.

197
00:14:46,579 --> 00:14:48,998
Don't expect too much, Tenma.

198
00:14:49,498 --> 00:14:53,127
It has the most advanced
defense systems ever created.

199
00:14:53,377 --> 00:14:54,920
I won't lose him again.

200
00:14:55,838 --> 00:14:57,756
Did you bring what I asked?

201
00:14:57,965 --> 00:15:00,342
I couldn't refuse a grieving father.

202
00:15:05,431 --> 00:15:09,310
The Core is unpredictable.
I can't guarantee what effect.

203
00:15:09,518 --> 00:15:12,271
It's gonna make it perfect!
Perfect!

204
00:15:12,855 --> 00:15:14,273
Just like Toby was.

205
00:16:21,465 --> 00:16:22,258
Dad?

206
00:16:23,384 --> 00:16:24,260
Toby.

207
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:32,393
Dad!

208
00:16:33,310 --> 00:16:34,937
Welcome back, son.

209
00:16:35,604 --> 00:16:39,775
Thank you, Elefun. I'm going
to take it... him... home now.

210
00:16:40,609 --> 00:16:43,946
Quality time. Bonding.
All the good things.

211
00:16:44,738 --> 00:16:45,948
Bye, Dr. Elefun.

212
00:16:46,615 --> 00:16:48,450
Bye... Toby.

213
00:16:50,411 --> 00:16:51,871
Incredible.

214
00:17:12,975 --> 00:17:13,767
Dad?

215
00:17:16,479 --> 00:17:20,024
Good morning, son.
How do you feel?

216
00:17:21,192 --> 00:17:24,904
Kind of weird.
Have I been sick or something?

217
00:17:25,404 --> 00:17:29,408
You're fine. You're perfect.
You're wonderful.

218
00:17:29,617 --> 00:17:31,410
That's good, because...

219
00:17:38,626 --> 00:17:39,960
Are you okay?

220
00:17:44,423 --> 00:17:47,676
I must be malfunctioning,
wires crossing...

221
00:17:47,885 --> 00:17:50,429
short-circuiting!
It can't be you. You're...

222
00:17:52,765 --> 00:17:54,225
Oh, my gosh!

223
00:17:54,475 --> 00:17:56,268
You're... you're...

224
00:17:56,477 --> 00:17:57,686
Orrin, are you okay?

225
00:17:57,895 --> 00:18:00,689
You're going to be late to school.

226
00:18:04,068 --> 00:18:09,156
I must say, it's very nice
to see you again.

227
00:18:09,907 --> 00:18:12,368
Sit down, Toby.
I wanna talk to you.

228
00:18:12,576 --> 00:18:13,494
Sure, Dad.

229
00:18:13,911 --> 00:18:18,082
I've decided you shouldn't go
to school anymore, son.

230
00:18:18,624 --> 00:18:21,335
I'm gonna teach you at home... myself.

231
00:18:21,710 --> 00:18:22,711
Sounds good to me.

232
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:25,756
Orrin, looks like we'll be
hanging out together.

233
00:18:26,006 --> 00:18:27,758
Together?

234
00:18:27,967 --> 00:18:32,137
That'll be very nice, Master Toby.

235
00:18:32,847 --> 00:18:33,806
Oh, dear.

236
00:18:34,223 --> 00:18:36,725
Please, Toby, just let
the robot do its thing.

237
00:18:36,934 --> 00:18:37,852
Sorry.

238
00:18:38,853 --> 00:18:42,815
If you're going to be home-schooling
me, what about the Ministry?

239
00:18:43,065 --> 00:18:46,735
My job now is to be your father.

240
00:18:48,028 --> 00:18:50,197
I am so freaked!

241
00:18:52,658 --> 00:18:54,869
Let's start you out
with something familiar.

242
00:18:55,536 --> 00:18:58,289
Four-dimensional calculus.
It's your favorite.

243
00:18:59,248 --> 00:19:00,166
I guess it is.

244
00:19:00,374 --> 00:19:04,503
If sir wishes, perhaps
I could help Master Toby with...

245
00:19:05,462 --> 00:19:09,425
Bad idea! I'm a robot.
What am I thinking?

246
00:19:11,385 --> 00:19:12,636
Wrong way.

247
00:19:13,637 --> 00:19:15,764
Okay... there.

248
00:19:17,683 --> 00:19:18,350
Excellent.

249
00:19:19,894 --> 00:19:20,561
Yeah.

250
00:19:21,687 --> 00:19:22,771
Interesting solution.

251
00:19:23,981 --> 00:19:25,441
Good.

252
00:19:29,278 --> 00:19:32,364
Bravo. Wonderful, Toby.
First rate, son.

253
00:19:32,656 --> 00:19:33,949
You ain't seen nothing yet.

254
00:19:41,457 --> 00:19:42,291
Howdy!

255
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:45,586
"That fractal's looking fair.
Cosine, tangent, it's a square!"

256
00:19:45,794 --> 00:19:48,672
"Is that secant high or low?
Watch me as I dosey doe."

257
00:19:51,383 --> 00:19:53,052
Let's get back to basics.

258
00:19:53,385 --> 00:19:55,054
Do you remember this one?

259
00:19:55,221 --> 00:19:57,223
Kant's "Critique of Pure Reason."

260
00:19:57,431 --> 00:19:59,225
I used to read it to you in
bed when you were little.

261
00:20:00,518 --> 00:20:01,435
To put me to sleep?

262
00:20:02,186 --> 00:20:04,647
Yes! You asked for it every night.

263
00:20:06,315 --> 00:20:07,358
That's not quite what I...

264
00:20:07,566 --> 00:20:11,362
Try re-reading these.
Get the old brain humming again.

265
00:20:30,297 --> 00:20:31,257
Next.

266
00:20:50,776 --> 00:20:52,236
Beautiful.

267
00:20:52,945 --> 00:20:54,071
I got it!

268
00:20:55,114 --> 00:20:56,448
That was close.

269
00:20:56,657 --> 00:20:58,701
Way to go. You're the man.

270
00:20:59,285 --> 00:21:03,372
I haven't has this much fun since,
well, ever.

271
00:21:03,747 --> 00:21:04,957
Check this out.

272
00:21:13,549 --> 00:21:17,219
I'm not knocked out,
but I'm impressed.

273
00:21:17,678 --> 00:21:19,388
That's nothing. Watch this!

274
00:21:25,311 --> 00:21:29,356
Now, that's impressive,
Master Toby!

275
00:21:30,107 --> 00:21:31,609
Just "Toby" is fine, Orrin.

276
00:21:37,907 --> 00:21:39,033
Toby...

277
00:21:42,953 --> 00:21:47,041
I said to read the books,
not destroy them!

278
00:21:47,249 --> 00:21:50,002
I, I just wanted to test
Da Vinci's theories.

279
00:21:50,711 --> 00:21:52,505
I, perhaps...

280
00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:57,301
encouraged Master Toby, sir.

281
00:22:01,347 --> 00:22:04,975
You should not be wearing that hat.

282
00:22:05,768 --> 00:22:10,314
A robot should not be wearing
my son's... Toby's hat.

283
00:22:18,864 --> 00:22:22,326
It's fine.
I don't even like the hat.

284
00:22:26,872 --> 00:22:28,374
I think you should go to your room.

285
00:22:28,582 --> 00:22:30,626
- But, Dad...
- Do as you're told!

286
00:22:45,349 --> 00:22:47,143
Tenma? What's wrong?

287
00:22:47,726 --> 00:22:49,562
I think I've made a terrible mistake.

288
00:22:49,854 --> 00:22:53,774
I thought he would be like
Toby but he's not.

289
00:22:53,983 --> 00:22:56,402
He's strange.
He's very strange.

290
00:22:56,652 --> 00:22:58,696
Strange how?

291
00:22:58,904 --> 00:23:02,408
He's brilliant...
as Toby was, but different.

292
00:23:02,908 --> 00:23:06,495
You can't expect him to be
a carbon copy. Give him time.

293
00:23:06,745 --> 00:23:08,038
You don't understand.

294
00:23:08,914 --> 00:23:10,833
He was meant to replace Toby, but...

295
00:23:11,041 --> 00:23:15,713
every time I look at him,
I'm reminded that Toby's gone...

296
00:23:17,381 --> 00:23:19,175
and he's never coming back.

297
00:23:28,517 --> 00:23:29,977
What's different?

298
00:23:30,519 --> 00:23:32,521
I haven't seen Dad angry before.

299
00:23:38,861 --> 00:23:40,821
Check out the haircut on that one.

300
00:23:41,447 --> 00:23:43,073
It looks like he's got horns.

301
00:23:43,324 --> 00:23:44,283
Horns! Good one!

302
00:23:44,492 --> 00:23:46,660
What do you mean, "horns"
It's gel!

303
00:23:47,578 --> 00:23:49,747
Wait... I can understand you?

304
00:23:49,955 --> 00:23:50,998
That's creepy.

305
00:23:51,207 --> 00:23:53,375
- What is?
- It's like he can understand us.

306
00:23:53,709 --> 00:23:54,543
Don't be a dummy!

307
00:23:54,752 --> 00:23:56,295
I can hear what you're saying!

308
00:23:56,504 --> 00:23:57,880
It's as if he can hear
what we're saying.

309
00:23:58,088 --> 00:24:00,216
There's no way. He's a human!

310
00:24:01,217 --> 00:24:03,552
Let's go leak oil on some statues.

311
00:24:04,553 --> 00:24:05,679
Okey-dokey.

312
00:24:07,473 --> 00:24:10,017
How can I understand what
you're saying? You're robots!

313
00:24:10,226 --> 00:24:11,435
We don't want any trouble.

314
00:24:11,644 --> 00:24:14,688
Wait! I just want to know
what's going on. What happened to me?

315
00:24:21,111 --> 00:24:25,783
Okay, let's back up very carefully.

316
00:24:27,576 --> 00:24:28,661
Oh, no!

317
00:24:30,329 --> 00:24:31,914
Hang on, buddy! We're coming!

318
00:24:39,463 --> 00:24:41,131
That's too freaky for me.

319
00:25:03,737 --> 00:25:04,405
Uh-oh!

320
00:25:12,830 --> 00:25:14,832
Waiter, this steak
is under-cooked.

321
00:26:48,717 --> 00:26:52,721
This is so cool.
I have to show Dad.

322
00:26:59,395 --> 00:27:01,981
How can my approval ratings
be this low?

323
00:27:02,231 --> 00:27:06,777
I was popular in high school.
I cut taxes for influential friends.

324
00:27:07,236 --> 00:27:08,279
What more do people want?

325
00:27:08,487 --> 00:27:11,824
We're tracking an unidentified
flying object over Metro City, sir.

326
00:27:12,074 --> 00:27:13,784
The surface-dwellers
are firing at us?

327
00:27:14,076 --> 00:27:16,704
This is what I've been waiting for!
Declare war on them!

328
00:27:16,954 --> 00:27:18,539
This is going to get me re-elected!

329
00:27:18,747 --> 00:27:20,082
This didn't come from
the surface, sir.

330
00:27:20,291 --> 00:27:22,418
It's my opponent.
He's taken the gloves off.

331
00:27:22,626 --> 00:27:23,502
He's playing hardball.

332
00:27:23,711 --> 00:27:25,045
It's Blue Core energy, sir!

333
00:27:25,337 --> 00:27:28,549
What? Elefun told me
the Blue Core was destroyed.

334
00:27:28,757 --> 00:27:32,344
Get me a location! Mobilize all units!
I want that thing now!

335
00:27:34,305 --> 00:27:36,307
I got here as fast as I could.

336
00:27:36,765 --> 00:27:38,642
Where is he? Where's Toby?

337
00:27:38,851 --> 00:27:39,852
I sent him to his room.

338
00:27:40,060 --> 00:27:42,188
Please just deactivate him and
take him away.

339
00:27:42,396 --> 00:27:45,858
I can't bear to see his face again.

340
00:27:46,609 --> 00:27:49,612
You can't just throw him away
like a piece of junk.

341
00:27:49,820 --> 00:27:50,488
Dad?

342
00:27:52,865 --> 00:27:54,074
What's going on?

343
00:27:54,450 --> 00:27:56,118
Why are you talking about me
like this?

344
00:27:56,327 --> 00:27:58,913
There's been a bit
of a misunderstanding.

345
00:27:59,121 --> 00:28:03,083
You're not actually an
entirely ordinary boy.

346
00:28:03,459 --> 00:28:04,710
I, I know.

347
00:28:04,919 --> 00:28:08,881
I can fly. I can drill through
solid rock. It's amazing.

348
00:28:09,882 --> 00:28:11,717
How did I think this could work?

349
00:28:12,551 --> 00:28:13,636
What's wrong with me?

350
00:28:14,303 --> 00:28:15,721
Why don't you love me anymore?

351
00:28:15,930 --> 00:28:18,641
He's programmed with
the memories of your own son.

352
00:28:18,849 --> 00:28:19,517
Programmed?

353
00:28:19,725 --> 00:28:21,519
Doesn't that mean anything to you?

354
00:28:23,312 --> 00:28:24,438
But he isn't my son.

355
00:28:26,023 --> 00:28:26,690
Dad.

356
00:28:28,150 --> 00:28:31,946
I, I'm not your Dad.
You're not Toby.

357
00:28:32,279 --> 00:28:34,156
You're a copy.

358
00:28:35,157 --> 00:28:38,369
Not my son. A robot. And I...

359
00:28:40,162 --> 00:28:43,791
I don't want you anymore.

360
00:28:43,999 --> 00:28:45,584
No! No!

361
00:28:46,794 --> 00:28:47,711
Toby!

362
00:28:48,295 --> 00:28:52,508
I can't see the future, but
I'm sure there's a place for you.

363
00:28:52,716 --> 00:28:53,384
You just have to find it.

364
00:28:53,592 --> 00:28:57,847
He's my father.
This is my home. It's all I know.

365
00:28:58,055 --> 00:29:00,599
Everyone has their destiny, Toby.

366
00:29:01,267 --> 00:29:04,186
Didn't you hear him? I'm not Toby.

367
00:29:04,854 --> 00:29:06,021
Please, Elefun.

368
00:29:32,882 --> 00:29:33,799
It's true.

369
00:29:35,384 --> 00:29:36,051
What?

370
00:29:38,554 --> 00:29:42,016
Sir, we located the signal's source.
It's, it's a child.

371
00:29:42,391 --> 00:29:44,185
Readings for the Core
are off the chart!

372
00:29:44,393 --> 00:29:46,187
Is that Tenma's boy?

373
00:29:46,479 --> 00:29:51,150
Of course not! Holy cow.
Tenma must've lost his mind.

374
00:29:51,567 --> 00:29:52,443
Bring it in.

375
00:29:52,735 --> 00:29:55,154
This is Stinger One.
Set weapons for capture.

376
00:29:55,446 --> 00:29:56,238
Oh, no.

377
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:00,868
Whoa! He just took off!

378
00:30:01,076 --> 00:30:04,121
Commander, engage the subject
with intent to capture!

379
00:30:12,129 --> 00:30:13,214
What do you guys want?

380
00:30:13,589 --> 00:30:15,799
Command Center,
we have it in our sights.

381
00:30:37,363 --> 00:30:38,113
Ta da!

382
00:30:38,948 --> 00:30:39,990
Oh, my... Oh!

383
00:30:40,282 --> 00:30:42,952
I'm just gonna take these things back.

384
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:45,162
I'm getting married!

385
00:30:45,454 --> 00:30:46,205
Get him!

386
00:30:50,709 --> 00:30:51,585
Where'd he go?

387
00:30:53,462 --> 00:30:54,213
What?

388
00:31:10,813 --> 00:31:12,523
We've got him. We're coming home.

389
00:31:54,064 --> 00:31:56,192
Oh, no, no, no!

390
00:31:57,568 --> 00:31:58,402
Oh, no!

391
00:32:07,953 --> 00:32:09,455
Send in the Spirit of Freedom.

392
00:32:10,706 --> 00:32:12,958
Destroy the robot,
then collect the Core.

393
00:32:15,252 --> 00:32:16,212
You're safe.

394
00:32:18,631 --> 00:32:21,050
Again? What's with you guys?

395
00:32:21,258 --> 00:32:22,092
I love you!

396
00:32:23,385 --> 00:32:24,470
Come on, then!

397
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:44,448
Fire!

398
00:33:03,050 --> 00:33:03,717
Finish it.

399
00:33:12,017 --> 00:33:13,269
Touchdown!

400
00:33:19,316 --> 00:33:20,943
Where's he going?

401
00:33:21,152 --> 00:33:21,986
It's falling to the surface, sir.

402
00:33:22,194 --> 00:33:23,112
Get him back!

403
00:33:23,445 --> 00:33:26,031
I'm declaring a state
of national emergency!

404
00:33:26,282 --> 00:33:30,953
All military personnel must work
until that boy is found.

405
00:33:53,767 --> 00:33:55,603
Welcome to your new home, kid.

406
00:33:57,229 --> 00:33:58,189
Hello.

407
00:33:59,356 --> 00:34:02,109
Batteries!
He's got new batteries!

408
00:34:02,568 --> 00:34:04,987
Spare a few volts for a fellow Sparky?

409
00:34:05,196 --> 00:34:05,863
New batteries.

410
00:34:06,071 --> 00:34:09,116
Help me, son. I'm fading fa...

411
00:34:10,493 --> 00:34:13,245
Table for one.
Smoking or non-smoking?

412
00:34:13,454 --> 00:34:16,499
Smoking. I'm smoking.
I'm definitely smoking.

413
00:34:16,707 --> 00:34:18,417
You're one of us, now.
Happy to meet you.

414
00:34:18,626 --> 00:34:21,462
Oh, no. I'm not one of you guys.

415
00:34:21,670 --> 00:34:22,922
You're a robot, ain't ya?

416
00:34:23,964 --> 00:34:24,632
Yes, but...

417
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:26,717
Welcome to the scrap heap.

418
00:34:26,926 --> 00:34:29,261
This is where we all end up
sooner or later.

419
00:34:29,470 --> 00:34:31,388
I'm not ready yet!

420
00:34:31,847 --> 00:34:33,516
- Hey! Get off of me!
- One of us. One of us.

421
00:34:33,724 --> 00:34:35,726
What are you doing?

422
00:34:36,268 --> 00:34:37,269
Incoming!

423
00:34:54,203 --> 00:34:55,621
What do I do?

424
00:34:57,915 --> 00:34:58,833
Dad?

425
00:35:02,670 --> 00:35:03,587
Who's there?

426
00:35:12,847 --> 00:35:16,350
You like me, huh? "Trashcan."

427
00:35:16,767 --> 00:35:18,477
Are you lost, Trashcan?

428
00:35:19,603 --> 00:35:20,855
I know I sure am.

429
00:35:22,690 --> 00:35:23,440
What is it, boy?

430
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:25,568
Someone's in trouble?

431
00:35:26,402 --> 00:35:27,403
Oh, no.

432
00:35:29,905 --> 00:35:31,532
Trashcan, wait up!

433
00:35:34,118 --> 00:35:35,786
Over here? Whoa!

434
00:35:37,204 --> 00:35:39,707
Is this it? Hello!

435
00:35:40,332 --> 00:35:41,709
They could be miles down.

436
00:35:41,876 --> 00:35:43,002
The hole looks pretty...

437
00:35:43,169 --> 00:35:44,128
deep!

438
00:35:47,923 --> 00:35:49,675
Quick... get the restraints on it.

439
00:35:49,925 --> 00:35:50,718
Hurry!

440
00:35:50,926 --> 00:35:52,845
Good work, boy!
Here's a treat for you.

441
00:35:53,929 --> 00:35:55,431
Hey! Knock it off!

442
00:35:57,349 --> 00:35:58,809
That's not a robot.

443
00:35:59,018 --> 00:35:59,810
It's a kid.

444
00:36:00,686 --> 00:36:05,024
That, that's right.
I'm a kid like you.

445
00:36:05,274 --> 00:36:05,941
What?

446
00:36:06,150 --> 00:36:08,819
We want robots, not kids,
you stupid garbage eater.

447
00:36:09,028 --> 00:36:10,863
Where are you from, non-robot?

448
00:36:11,071 --> 00:36:12,781
I'm from Metro City.

449
00:36:13,032 --> 00:36:17,036
Can you believe that guys?
He's from Metro City...

450
00:36:17,286 --> 00:36:18,245
and he's actually talking to me.

451
00:36:18,454 --> 00:36:19,497
Are you feeling okay?

452
00:36:19,705 --> 00:36:21,081
Oh, my gosh! He talked to me twice.

453
00:36:21,290 --> 00:36:25,002
This is going in my diary...
the most exciting day of my life.

454
00:36:25,211 --> 00:36:27,880
I get it. You don't like people
from Metro City.

455
00:36:28,380 --> 00:36:31,800
Metro City.
Robots waiting on you hand and foot.

456
00:36:31,967 --> 00:36:34,428
I'd love to visit,
just for one day.

457
00:36:34,929 --> 00:36:39,600
You can't. "No losers from
the surface allowed" is the rule.

458
00:36:39,975 --> 00:36:43,354
Why would you want to go?
They think you're garbage.

459
00:36:44,647 --> 00:36:46,398
I mean, look at this!

460
00:36:46,899 --> 00:36:48,943
Can you believe someone just
threw this away?

461
00:36:49,109 --> 00:36:50,986
Finders keepers.

462
00:36:52,071 --> 00:36:53,489
What are you doing down here?

463
00:36:54,657 --> 00:36:59,286
I don' know. Looking for something.
Somewhere.

464
00:36:59,495 --> 00:37:00,454
Did you run away?

465
00:37:00,955 --> 00:37:05,084
Not exactly.
They suggested I find a new place.

466
00:37:05,876 --> 00:37:06,877
Whatever that means.

467
00:37:07,336 --> 00:37:09,421
Dude, it means they kicked you out.

468
00:37:09,630 --> 00:37:11,715
Well, I...

469
00:37:11,924 --> 00:37:12,800
- I'm Zane.
- I'm Widget.

470
00:37:13,008 --> 00:37:15,302
I'm Sludge.
I'm older than her.

471
00:37:15,511 --> 00:37:16,512
By ninety seconds.

472
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:18,222
And I'm Cora.
What's your name?

473
00:37:18,430 --> 00:37:19,390
It's...

474
00:37:20,307 --> 00:37:22,268
Viva La Roboto-lution!

475
00:37:22,726 --> 00:37:23,978
What just happened?

476
00:37:26,021 --> 00:37:28,065
Did you see the humans' faces?

477
00:37:28,274 --> 00:37:30,734
They were quaking in their
capitalist boots!

478
00:37:32,778 --> 00:37:34,488
Don't worry, brother.
You're safe!

479
00:37:34,697 --> 00:37:35,990
You have been rescued by...

480
00:37:37,199 --> 00:37:39,451
The Robot Revolutionary Front!

481
00:37:40,786 --> 00:37:42,246
I'm Sparx - the brains.

482
00:37:42,496 --> 00:37:45,124
I'm Robotsky - the muscle.

483
00:37:45,332 --> 00:37:49,003
And I'm Mike the Fridge.
I'm the fridge.

484
00:37:49,712 --> 00:37:51,380
You are now liberated!

485
00:37:51,589 --> 00:37:56,135
Go ahead, comrade.
Take your first step as a free robot.

486
00:37:56,343 --> 00:37:57,553
Take it! Take it!

487
00:38:01,015 --> 00:38:02,183
It feels different, doesn't it?

488
00:38:03,726 --> 00:38:04,810
It feels wetter.

489
00:38:05,019 --> 00:38:08,272
It feels wetter! Liberation!

490
00:38:08,481 --> 00:38:10,649
Yeah!

491
00:38:10,858 --> 00:38:12,234
What are you doing?

492
00:38:13,861 --> 00:38:17,364
Sorry. I'll pick it up.

493
00:38:17,615 --> 00:38:18,991
Yes, please.

494
00:38:20,075 --> 00:38:23,078
You look like
an advanced model, brother.

495
00:38:23,287 --> 00:38:27,583
Are you exempt from
the laws of robotics?

496
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,293
Um, remind me?

497
00:38:29,502 --> 00:38:32,838
A robot can't harm or be
the cause of harm to a human...

498
00:38:33,047 --> 00:38:35,508
blah, blah, blah,
boring, boring, boring.

499
00:38:35,883 --> 00:38:38,219
I don't really want
to harm anybody.

500
00:38:38,427 --> 00:38:39,178
Lugnuts!

501
00:38:39,804 --> 00:38:42,515
The RRF are dedicated
to freeing robot-kind...

502
00:38:42,723 --> 00:38:45,768
from human slavery,
by any means necessary.

503
00:38:45,976 --> 00:38:49,438
And he means any means necessary.

504
00:38:49,647 --> 00:38:51,065
What is your name, comrade?

505
00:38:52,107 --> 00:38:52,775
Toby.

506
00:38:53,192 --> 00:38:54,068
Toby?

507
00:38:54,276 --> 00:38:55,152
That's not much of a name.

508
00:38:55,361 --> 00:38:56,987
You want something with a bit
more oomph to it.

509
00:38:57,196 --> 00:38:58,906
Something like,
"The Ice-maker."

510
00:38:59,114 --> 00:39:00,950
Or, "The Annihilator."

511
00:39:01,450 --> 00:39:02,660
Or, "Pauline."

512
00:39:03,452 --> 00:39:04,745
I guess I'll...

513
00:39:04,954 --> 00:39:07,289
Hang on, we haven't come up
with your new name yet.

514
00:39:07,498 --> 00:39:08,290
What about...

515
00:39:11,335 --> 00:39:13,671
What about Astro?

516
00:39:13,963 --> 00:39:16,799
If you can't come up with
a sensible suggestion...

517
00:39:17,007 --> 00:39:18,801
then kindly mind your own business.

518
00:39:19,009 --> 00:39:19,677
Sorry.

519
00:39:19,885 --> 00:39:21,512
Think.

520
00:39:21,679 --> 00:39:22,555
- I've got it!
- What?

521
00:39:22,805 --> 00:39:23,806
Astro!

522
00:39:24,014 --> 00:39:25,307
That's marvelous.

523
00:39:25,516 --> 00:39:27,309
It's modern.
A little space-age. I love it.

524
00:39:27,518 --> 00:39:29,812
Thanks, guys.
I better get going.

525
00:39:30,020 --> 00:39:32,022
Show Astro the plan!

526
00:39:32,231 --> 00:39:33,524
As you wish, comrade.

527
00:39:34,108 --> 00:39:34,900
This is Hamegg!

528
00:39:38,362 --> 00:39:39,071
Nice.

529
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:41,157
The likes of him enslave our kind.

530
00:39:41,365 --> 00:39:43,242
We need to make an example of Hamegg.

531
00:39:43,450 --> 00:39:46,036
We want to do something so horrible,
so frightening...

532
00:39:46,245 --> 00:39:49,957
so shocking, that the humans
are forced to free all robots.

533
00:39:50,457 --> 00:39:51,125
What are you gonna do?

534
00:39:51,333 --> 00:39:52,585
We're gonna sneak into town.

535
00:39:52,793 --> 00:39:54,503
We're going to lie in wait for Hamegg.

536
00:39:54,712 --> 00:39:55,379
And?

537
00:39:55,588 --> 00:39:57,256
When he shows up...

538
00:39:57,548 --> 00:39:58,257
Yes?

539
00:39:58,465 --> 00:40:01,385
Remember we're forced to follow
the laws of robotics.

540
00:40:01,594 --> 00:40:02,261
Okay.

541
00:40:02,470 --> 00:40:06,015
We are going to tickle him
with a feather!

542
00:40:06,765 --> 00:40:08,058
Viva La Roboto-lution!

543
00:40:08,267 --> 00:40:09,393
That's the plan?

544
00:40:09,685 --> 00:40:11,687
We're already looking into
purchasing the feather.

545
00:40:12,188 --> 00:40:13,230
Blimey!

546
00:40:13,898 --> 00:40:14,690
Are you okay?

547
00:40:14,899 --> 00:40:16,525
How did you find our secret hideout?

548
00:40:17,610 --> 00:40:19,737
You guys need to work
on your camouflage skills.

549
00:40:19,945 --> 00:40:22,406
Don't make us dismantle you.
We just want the kid back.

550
00:40:22,698 --> 00:40:24,200
Kid? What are you talking about?
He's a...

551
00:40:26,327 --> 00:40:28,037
You want a piece of me, tin man?

552
00:40:28,245 --> 00:40:30,581
Be cool. I'm an undercover robot
from Metro City.

553
00:40:30,789 --> 00:40:33,459
I knew it. Viva La Roboto-lution.

554
00:40:34,335 --> 00:40:36,754
These guys aren't doing any harm.
Let's just leave them.

555
00:40:37,296 --> 00:40:38,422
Whatever you say.

556
00:40:40,174 --> 00:40:43,511
Thank you.
The RFF are forever in your debt.

557
00:40:46,055 --> 00:40:47,473
What is your name?

558
00:40:48,641 --> 00:40:52,311
Toby, but that's not who
I really am. You see...

559
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:53,687
Dude, it's a simple question.

560
00:40:55,731 --> 00:40:59,026
My name is... Astro.
Call me Astro.

561
00:40:59,235 --> 00:41:00,486
Sounds modern.

562
00:41:00,694 --> 00:41:02,154
A little space age. I love it.

563
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:04,740
I'll be right there.

564
00:41:05,533 --> 00:41:07,201
- Good afternoon. How...
- Excuse me, robot. Thank you.

565
00:41:07,409 --> 00:41:09,411
Search the apartment!
Leave no stone un-turned.

566
00:41:09,703 --> 00:41:10,913
Arrest this man!

567
00:41:11,121 --> 00:41:11,789
Yes, sir.

568
00:41:11,997 --> 00:41:13,207
What are you doing? Stop!

569
00:41:13,415 --> 00:41:15,125
Where is Tenma's robot son?

570
00:41:15,376 --> 00:41:16,544
He isn't here!

571
00:41:16,752 --> 00:41:18,087
What is the meaning of this?

572
00:41:18,420 --> 00:41:21,131
You put my Peacekeeper's Core
into your robot.

573
00:41:21,340 --> 00:41:23,884
I'm running for re-election,
in case you hadn't noticed, and...

574
00:41:24,093 --> 00:41:25,719
we're in an arms race with
the Surface!

575
00:41:25,928 --> 00:41:28,013
An arms race? What nonsense.

576
00:41:29,765 --> 00:41:33,352
It was a stupid mistake.
When I lost my son...

577
00:41:33,561 --> 00:41:38,065
I thought... I'd be able to...
I thought...

578
00:41:38,357 --> 00:41:43,946
I hate losing, too. You want proof?
Ask any of my wives.

579
00:41:44,155 --> 00:41:47,199
But we must get over all
this personal stuff.

580
00:41:47,408 --> 00:41:50,786
You're head of the Ministry of Science.
It's time to move on.

581
00:41:50,995 --> 00:41:53,330
Get the Core back.
Get it in the Peacekeeper.

582
00:41:53,539 --> 00:41:55,833
Let some good come from all this mess.

583
00:42:00,296 --> 00:42:03,340
When you find the robot,
I'll deactivate it...

584
00:42:04,133 --> 00:42:05,593
and give you the Core.

585
00:42:05,801 --> 00:42:06,552
Good man.

586
00:42:06,969 --> 00:42:07,845
Let him go.

587
00:42:11,056 --> 00:42:13,309
Let's hope you never find him.

588
00:42:15,019 --> 00:42:17,313
There's actually people living
in these ruins?

589
00:42:17,563 --> 00:42:21,650
Ruins? This may not look like
much compared to Metro City...

590
00:42:21,859 --> 00:42:23,360
but this is our home.

591
00:42:23,736 --> 00:42:24,403
Here we are.

592
00:42:29,658 --> 00:42:30,701
Come on, Astro.

593
00:42:31,660 --> 00:42:32,328
Whoa!

594
00:42:37,291 --> 00:42:37,958
Sorry.

595
00:42:45,508 --> 00:42:47,009
What's the password?

596
00:42:47,301 --> 00:42:48,511
Don't make me hurt you.

597
00:42:49,678 --> 00:42:50,930
Close enough.

598
00:43:00,439 --> 00:43:01,357
Fore!

599
00:43:02,024 --> 00:43:02,900
Five!

600
00:43:03,234 --> 00:43:04,109
You're out!

601
00:43:04,443 --> 00:43:06,779
We're out of apples.
We're on to grapes.

602
00:43:07,780 --> 00:43:09,740
Did you bring me back something?

603
00:43:09,949 --> 00:43:12,368
The perfect gift for
a sweet little girl.

604
00:43:13,452 --> 00:43:14,453
Thanks!

605
00:43:14,954 --> 00:43:16,080
Be careful!

606
00:43:16,872 --> 00:43:17,706
Too late!

607
00:43:17,873 --> 00:43:19,124
Hey, we're kind of tired!

608
00:43:19,458 --> 00:43:21,377
- Are you okay?
- Sure.

609
00:43:21,627 --> 00:43:23,546
You need ten sets of eyes
around here.

610
00:43:30,010 --> 00:43:31,095
Hey, Hamegg.

611
00:43:34,098 --> 00:43:36,684
Ah-ha! Back so soon?

612
00:43:36,892 --> 00:43:39,311
Did you find anything good
for me today?

613
00:43:40,813 --> 00:43:43,482
I don't know, kids.
A lot of dead batteries.

614
00:43:43,691 --> 00:43:45,067
A lot of elbows here.

615
00:43:45,568 --> 00:43:49,530
The knee joint of a toilet-cleaning
robot? I need heads!

616
00:43:49,738 --> 00:43:51,407
We would've gotten better stuff,
but the...

617
00:43:51,615 --> 00:43:52,283
Whoa!

618
00:43:56,954 --> 00:43:58,080
Well, well.

619
00:43:58,289 --> 00:44:00,749
His name is Astro.
He's from Metro City.

620
00:44:01,250 --> 00:44:05,087
Metro City? I used to work there
once upon a time.

621
00:44:05,296 --> 00:44:05,963
Really?

622
00:44:06,881 --> 00:44:09,508
Why am I running a crummy body
repair shop down here...

623
00:44:09,717 --> 00:44:12,386
when I could be creating state
of the art robots in Metro City?

624
00:44:12,595 --> 00:44:13,888
I, I didn't mean to...

625
00:44:14,096 --> 00:44:18,100
Relax. We're family here.
Asking questions is allowed.

626
00:44:18,309 --> 00:44:22,980
The answer is: I love robots,
especially the discarded ones.

627
00:44:23,189 --> 00:44:25,316
The more banged-up they are,
the more abused...

628
00:44:25,524 --> 00:44:28,027
the more I like getting them
back on their feet.

629
00:44:30,446 --> 00:44:31,530
Wow!

630
00:44:31,906 --> 00:44:33,949
It's almost a religious thing with me.

631
00:44:34,158 --> 00:44:36,952
Kind of like the way
the saints feel about the poor...

632
00:44:37,161 --> 00:44:41,165
or women feel about shoes,
or fat people feel about donuts...

633
00:44:41,373 --> 00:44:44,960
Or... I'll stop with fat people
and donuts.

634
00:44:45,169 --> 00:44:47,838
So, you're not into, um,
enslaving robots?

635
00:44:48,130 --> 00:44:48,797
What?

636
00:44:49,006 --> 00:44:50,382
He ran into the RRF.

637
00:44:51,592 --> 00:44:56,680
I don't enslave robots.
I love robots!

638
00:44:57,139 --> 00:45:01,477
They're our friends.
We rely on them for our daily bread.

639
00:45:01,852 --> 00:45:03,979
Speaking of which,
are any of you misfits hungry?

640
00:45:06,690 --> 00:45:09,944
Let me guess, take-out pizza again?

641
00:45:10,152 --> 00:45:12,196
More like,
"taken out of the trash" again!

642
00:45:12,404 --> 00:45:15,699
Picky, picky.
It's only a couple days old.

643
00:45:15,991 --> 00:45:18,202
This one still has toppings!

644
00:45:20,621 --> 00:45:23,040
Haven't you forgotten something?

645
00:45:24,333 --> 00:45:26,043
What have they forgotten, son?

646
00:45:27,503 --> 00:45:28,170
Grace?

647
00:45:28,504 --> 00:45:30,631
Exactly. Grace!

648
00:45:31,173 --> 00:45:31,841
What?

649
00:45:32,049 --> 00:45:33,926
Would you please turn on the TV,
sweetheart?

650
00:45:34,135 --> 00:45:35,052
There's a dear.

651
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:39,056
Bon appetit!

652
00:45:39,348 --> 00:45:41,475
Yo, new guy?
You gonna eat that?

653
00:45:41,684 --> 00:45:42,810
You can have it if you want it.

654
00:45:43,018 --> 00:45:45,980
Don't be so nice.
You'll starve to death...

655
00:45:46,188 --> 00:45:48,357
or be the only survivor.

656
00:45:48,566 --> 00:45:51,235
Do your folks know where you are?

657
00:45:52,444 --> 00:45:53,779
I... I don't have any parents.

658
00:45:53,988 --> 00:45:57,199
How very sad.
Did you lose them?

659
00:45:57,408 --> 00:45:59,451
Or, did they lose you?

660
00:45:59,618 --> 00:46:03,998
The truth is, I'm actually a...

661
00:46:05,082 --> 00:46:05,749
I'm a...

662
00:46:07,209 --> 00:46:08,127
A what?

663
00:46:09,044 --> 00:46:09,795
Don't worry, son.

664
00:46:10,004 --> 00:46:13,549
We're all orphans down here.
It's nothing to be ashamed of.

665
00:46:15,217 --> 00:46:16,802
None of you have parents?

666
00:46:17,011 --> 00:46:18,929
Parents? Are you kidding me?

667
00:46:21,891 --> 00:46:23,601
This whole place is
a parent-free zone.

668
00:46:23,809 --> 00:46:26,854
I was born in a scrap heap.
I was raised by wild dogs.

669
00:46:27,062 --> 00:46:29,648
Are you sure it wasn't wild pigs?

670
00:46:48,792 --> 00:46:51,670
Are you feeling homesick
for Metro City?

671
00:46:53,088 --> 00:46:53,756
No.

672
00:46:54,215 --> 00:46:55,090
Me neither.

673
00:46:57,426 --> 00:47:00,721
I was the Ministry of Science's head
of advanced robotics.

674
00:47:01,931 --> 00:47:05,851
Right up there with Tenma and
the other mucky-mucks.

675
00:47:06,435 --> 00:47:07,228
What happened?

676
00:47:07,478 --> 00:47:09,230
What always happens to genius.

677
00:47:09,438 --> 00:47:11,941
They were intimidated by
my talent, my ideas...

678
00:47:12,608 --> 00:47:15,444
so they threw me away like an
old battery.

679
00:47:17,279 --> 00:47:18,280
I'm sorry.

680
00:47:18,864 --> 00:47:23,077
Not your problem.
I got a hunch about you, Astro.

681
00:47:23,494 --> 00:47:25,913
There's always room for a good
kid in this family.

682
00:47:27,373 --> 00:47:29,166
Now, how about getting some shut-eye?

683
00:47:30,251 --> 00:47:32,294
Good night... son.

684
00:47:33,754 --> 00:47:35,381
Good night, Hamegg.

685
00:47:39,051 --> 00:47:42,429
I'm gonna tell them.
Just, not yet, okay?

686
00:47:51,313 --> 00:47:52,523
Quit bugging me.

687
00:47:52,731 --> 00:47:55,860
I said I would. I just want
them to get used to me first.

688
00:47:59,029 --> 00:48:00,865
What does Hamegg want all
these parts for?

689
00:48:01,073 --> 00:48:05,953
He's a genius. He can make
cool robots from any old scrap.

690
00:48:06,162 --> 00:48:09,415
Then he puts them into
"Hamegg's Robot Games."

691
00:48:09,623 --> 00:48:10,583
Robot games?

692
00:48:10,791 --> 00:48:14,461
They're a tradition down here.
It's kind of a Roman thing.

693
00:48:14,670 --> 00:48:15,796
It's pretty cool.

694
00:48:16,005 --> 00:48:18,883
You're not going to find much here.
It's a graveyard.

695
00:48:19,383 --> 00:48:22,470
Mr. Metro City's first day and
he's already an expert.

696
00:48:22,720 --> 00:48:25,681
You'd be surprised.
I know a thing or two about robots.

697
00:48:25,890 --> 00:48:27,600
I think we've got something.

698
00:48:27,850 --> 00:48:28,517
See?

699
00:48:28,726 --> 00:48:29,351
Coming!

700
00:48:29,518 --> 00:48:30,186
Look!

701
00:48:31,687 --> 00:48:33,314
What's the matter, boy?

702
00:48:43,115 --> 00:48:44,825
That almost makes me wish
I could read.

703
00:48:46,702 --> 00:48:48,454
Nice try, rust-bucket.

704
00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:53,334
Cora, I think I found something!

705
00:48:57,546 --> 00:48:59,548
That's just an old
construction robot.

706
00:48:59,757 --> 00:49:02,384
It fell to the Surface, like,
a hundred years ago.

707
00:49:02,593 --> 00:49:04,011
Do you think Hamegg could use it?

708
00:49:04,220 --> 00:49:07,181
If he had a robot like that,
he'd make a fortune in the games.

709
00:49:07,389 --> 00:49:10,768
It's just junk.
We used to have picnics in its head.

710
00:49:10,976 --> 00:49:11,977
Just give me a minute.

711
00:49:12,186 --> 00:49:14,063
It weighs hundreds of tons.

712
00:49:14,271 --> 00:49:16,982
What are you going to do,
put it in your backpack?

713
00:49:18,275 --> 00:49:20,194
She'd flip if she knew
I could carry it.

714
00:49:41,632 --> 00:49:42,508
"Zog."

715
00:49:43,092 --> 00:49:45,970
I know you're not dead.
You're just pretending.

716
00:50:04,780 --> 00:50:05,614
Come on, big guy.

717
00:50:06,782 --> 00:50:08,117
Time to wake up.

718
00:50:22,923 --> 00:50:24,717
Let me help you.

719
00:50:26,802 --> 00:50:27,928
Come on.

720
00:50:41,233 --> 00:50:43,110
Show me what you got, Tiger.

721
00:50:47,072 --> 00:50:48,866
Hold it right there,
twinkle-toes.

722
00:50:49,116 --> 00:50:50,993
What are you,
some kind of ice skater?

723
00:50:51,202 --> 00:50:54,997
You plan on ballroom dancing
or fighting with this guy?

724
00:50:55,789 --> 00:50:57,791
That's better!
Now, hit him below the belt.

725
00:50:58,501 --> 00:51:00,628
That's what I'm talking about!

726
00:51:00,836 --> 00:51:05,216
Get him in a headlock and
pound him! Use your thumbs!

727
00:51:05,800 --> 00:51:09,637
Great, kid. I think you've got
the makings of a champion.

728
00:51:15,935 --> 00:51:17,520
Hi, Hamegg!

729
00:51:17,728 --> 00:51:19,146
Sorry about your robot.

730
00:51:20,648 --> 00:51:24,860
What, him? He wasn't really
working out anyway.

731
00:51:25,069 --> 00:51:30,157
This guy's something else!
Look at the legs on this baby.

732
00:51:30,533 --> 00:51:34,662
Look at those feet. No carbon-fiber
plastic junk on this guy.

733
00:51:34,870 --> 00:51:36,497
That's solid pig iron.

734
00:51:37,164 --> 00:51:39,875
Astro got it running, which
I'm still having trouble believing.

735
00:51:40,084 --> 00:51:43,671
It's been dead for at least a century!
How did you do it?

736
00:51:43,879 --> 00:51:47,216
Please tell me!

737
00:51:47,424 --> 00:51:50,386
I, I just kicked it,
like a vending machine.

738
00:51:50,594 --> 00:51:53,180
"Give me back my money!"
It was nothing.

739
00:51:53,389 --> 00:51:55,850
You hear that, kids?
A genius with modesty.

740
00:51:56,058 --> 00:51:57,601
I didn't think it occurred in nature.

741
00:51:58,602 --> 00:52:00,938
You're almost too good
to be true, kid.

742
00:52:01,147 --> 00:52:03,691
Keep this up and
I may just have to adopt you.

743
00:52:07,319 --> 00:52:11,031
Holy cow. This thing's got
enough juice to run a city.

744
00:52:11,824 --> 00:52:12,658
What was that?

745
00:52:12,950 --> 00:52:17,163
Just another machine with
a mind of its own.

746
00:52:22,751 --> 00:52:23,460
Ready, guys?

747
00:53:22,728 --> 00:53:24,730
ZGO

748
00:53:46,627 --> 00:53:49,964
Hey! I thought I was...
and you were...

749
00:53:51,423 --> 00:53:52,758
How did you do that?

750
00:53:53,050 --> 00:53:54,510
I'm faster than I look.

751
00:54:06,897 --> 00:54:08,691
Everybody say 'Limburger.'

752
00:54:08,899 --> 00:54:09,692
Limburger!

753
00:54:19,201 --> 00:54:20,286
Goodnight, Zog.

754
00:54:22,371 --> 00:54:25,833
Hey, Trashcan, you wanna play?

755
00:54:28,210 --> 00:54:29,253
Fetch!

756
00:54:32,131 --> 00:54:32,923
Oops.

757
00:54:40,014 --> 00:54:40,931
Hello?

758
00:54:43,934 --> 00:54:44,602
Hello?

759
00:54:45,144 --> 00:54:45,853
Hello?

760
00:54:46,270 --> 00:54:46,937
Ouch!

761
00:54:49,106 --> 00:54:52,234
Didn't your nanny-bots tell you it's
rude to sneak up on people?

762
00:54:52,485 --> 00:54:53,360
How's your head?

763
00:54:54,069 --> 00:54:55,070
It's still on.

764
00:54:56,405 --> 00:54:59,074
They say that sometimes
when it's really clear...

765
00:54:59,283 --> 00:55:01,076
you can still call through
to Metro City.

766
00:55:01,410 --> 00:55:02,912
You wanna call Metro City?

767
00:55:04,079 --> 00:55:06,832
You've never made a prank call before?

768
00:55:08,167 --> 00:55:11,462
The only thing is,
I can't get this stupid phone to work.

769
00:55:12,421 --> 00:55:13,422
Let me try.

770
00:55:13,798 --> 00:55:14,799
Knock yourself out.

771
00:55:21,514 --> 00:55:23,724
Here. It's kind of weak,
but there is a signal.

772
00:55:24,600 --> 00:55:28,395
Not bad.
The kid has hidden talents.

773
00:55:28,604 --> 00:55:30,189
You have no idea.

774
00:55:31,774 --> 00:55:36,237
Come on, pick up, please.
It's me, Cora.

775
00:55:38,531 --> 00:55:39,865
I miss you guys.

776
00:55:42,201 --> 00:55:43,285
Are you okay?

777
00:55:43,661 --> 00:55:47,081
Sometimes I wonder if
they've even noticed I'm gone.

778
00:55:47,331 --> 00:55:48,082
Who?

779
00:55:49,708 --> 00:55:50,751
My parents.

780
00:55:51,168 --> 00:55:53,003
Your parents?

781
00:55:53,796 --> 00:55:56,465
Now you know the truth about me.

782
00:55:57,091 --> 00:56:00,594
What are you waiting for?
Go tell Zane and the others that...

783
00:56:00,803 --> 00:56:05,015
Cora's from Metro City and
she's still trying to call home.

784
00:56:05,224 --> 00:56:08,310
And that you were raised
by nanny-bots.

785
00:56:11,147 --> 00:56:16,026
Everybody's got secrets.
I won't tell. You can trust me.

786
00:56:16,318 --> 00:56:19,446
You're a good guy, Astro.

787
00:56:21,157 --> 00:56:24,702
Can, can I tell you my secret?

788
00:56:24,910 --> 00:56:27,454
That's what friends are for, right?

789
00:56:28,539 --> 00:56:30,875
Do you ever feel
like you're an outsider?

790
00:56:31,834 --> 00:56:35,588
Like, you're different from
everyone else?

791
00:56:35,963 --> 00:56:39,467
Everyone feels like that sometimes.

792
00:56:39,842 --> 00:56:42,178
The last few days have been
different for me.

793
00:56:42,970 --> 00:56:45,806
Being with all you guys...
and Hamegg...

794
00:56:47,183 --> 00:56:48,893
the thing I need
to tell you is, I'm a...

795
00:56:50,519 --> 00:56:52,313
I'm kind of a...

796
00:56:53,814 --> 00:56:54,482
I'm a...

797
00:56:55,608 --> 00:56:56,275
Yeah?

798
00:56:56,734 --> 00:57:00,529
I'm... I'm really starting to
like it here with you.

799
00:57:01,614 --> 00:57:02,531
With you guys.

800
00:57:03,032 --> 00:57:03,699
Yeah?

801
00:57:05,826 --> 00:57:07,536
We like you too, Astro.

802
00:57:10,372 --> 00:57:11,540
Hey, Trashcan.

803
00:57:16,837 --> 00:57:18,547
I know it's not the same thing, but...

804
00:57:18,964 --> 00:57:20,883
Isn't Hamegg sort of like our dad now?

805
00:57:21,842 --> 00:57:23,677
I guess he is.

806
00:57:31,060 --> 00:57:34,313
Robot Revolutionary Front, transform!

807
00:57:40,194 --> 00:57:42,029
Check, check.

808
00:57:44,532 --> 00:57:45,407
Yeah.

809
00:57:49,620 --> 00:57:53,833
Get off! What part of "ninja-like"
don't you understand?

810
00:57:54,124 --> 00:57:55,543
What's a ninja?

811
00:57:56,418 --> 00:57:59,213
Bring out the secret weapon.

812
00:58:11,767 --> 00:58:13,060
I've been looking for that.

813
00:58:16,772 --> 00:58:18,149
Viva La Roboto-lution!

814
00:58:18,649 --> 00:58:20,192
My fellow Surface dwellers!

815
00:58:20,442 --> 00:58:22,194
Today is the day you've all
been waiting for!

816
00:58:22,486 --> 00:58:25,406
Give the kid in
the red boots a hand, folks!

817
00:58:25,781 --> 00:58:28,784
He got this killing machine up
and running!

818
00:58:28,993 --> 00:58:30,494
Look out, Hamegg.

819
00:58:34,456 --> 00:58:36,917
You are the golden child.
Hamegg really likes you.

820
00:58:37,126 --> 00:58:38,210
I like him, too.

821
00:58:38,919 --> 00:58:40,629
What's he mean by "killing machine"?

822
00:58:40,838 --> 00:58:43,007
The robots fight until one of
them is destroyed.

823
00:58:43,215 --> 00:58:43,883
What?

824
00:58:44,091 --> 00:58:46,719
Don't worry.
Zog is gonna crush them all.

825
00:58:46,927 --> 00:58:48,721
That's what happens at
the robot games?

826
00:58:48,929 --> 00:58:51,140
What did you expect?
Rock, paper, scissors?

827
00:58:51,724 --> 00:58:53,142
- Who's the robot?
- I'm the robot!

828
00:58:53,350 --> 00:58:54,810
- Who's the robot?
- I'm the robot!

829
00:58:55,019 --> 00:58:56,687
- Who's the robot?
- I'm the robot!

830
00:58:56,896 --> 00:58:57,980
- No mercy!
- No mercy!

831
00:58:58,230 --> 00:59:01,817
- No mercy!
- No mercy!

832
00:59:05,696 --> 00:59:06,363
Mercy?

833
00:59:06,572 --> 00:59:07,823
Nice knowing you, kid.

834
00:59:08,032 --> 00:59:10,075
I thought it was a show,
not a slaughter.

835
00:59:10,284 --> 00:59:11,494
They're just robots, son.

836
00:59:11,702 --> 00:59:12,786
I thought you liked robots.

837
00:59:12,995 --> 00:59:14,705
I do, but at the end of the day...

838
00:59:14,997 --> 00:59:17,082
they're just junk waiting to happen.

839
00:59:17,708 --> 00:59:20,503
I know, some of those
advanced ones from...

840
00:59:20,711 --> 00:59:24,715
Metro City are programmed
to smile and laugh just like us.

841
00:59:24,965 --> 00:59:25,633
Really?

842
00:59:25,925 --> 00:59:28,636
Oh, yeah. Unfortunately,
they don't have real emotions...

843
00:59:29,094 --> 00:59:31,555
which is why I have no problem
doing this!

844
00:59:38,229 --> 00:59:39,522
It worked! I don't believe it!

845
00:59:39,730 --> 00:59:40,439
What are you doing?

846
00:59:40,606 --> 00:59:43,859
I stole this from Dr. Tenma after he
fired me from the Ministry of Science.

847
00:59:44,026 --> 00:59:46,111
Who cares?
Why did you do that to Astro?

848
00:59:46,278 --> 00:59:46,987
He's our friend!

849
00:59:47,196 --> 00:59:49,281
I thought I raised you better.
Are you blind?

850
00:59:49,532 --> 00:59:50,533
He's a robot!

851
00:59:51,867 --> 00:59:54,745
That's not true.
It can't be true.

852
00:59:54,954 --> 00:59:58,457
He's programmed to be nice.
He's not really nice.

853
00:59:58,666 --> 01:00:01,085
He's just an incredibly
powerful machine.

854
01:00:01,377 --> 01:00:02,586
But he was so...

855
01:00:02,795 --> 01:00:04,004
I know, sweetheart.

856
01:00:04,547 --> 01:00:05,589
It's got to be tough.

857
01:00:06,090 --> 01:00:07,383
What are you gonna do with him?

858
01:00:07,675 --> 01:00:09,093
Take a wild guess.

859
01:00:16,392 --> 01:00:18,519
Ladies and gentlemen,
boys and girls...

860
01:00:18,727 --> 01:00:22,148
and all you riff-raff who snuck
in without buying a ticket...

861
01:00:22,356 --> 01:00:26,527
allow me to present, Astro Boy!

862
01:00:29,113 --> 01:00:32,408
I know. You're wondering
what such a nice looking kid...

863
01:00:32,616 --> 01:00:34,076
is doing in a place like this.

864
01:00:34,326 --> 01:00:35,870
That ain't no kid, folks.

865
01:00:36,537 --> 01:00:40,791
That's a robot from Metro City.

866
01:00:41,375 --> 01:00:45,588
Get this, folks,
Astro personally told me that...

867
01:00:45,796 --> 01:00:48,549
he doesn't think much of our
fighting robots.

868
01:00:48,757 --> 01:00:49,758
Boo!

869
01:00:49,967 --> 01:00:52,011
He thinks they're all
a bunch of sissies!

870
01:00:52,219 --> 01:00:54,597
He thinks you're all trailer
park trash!

871
01:00:54,805 --> 01:00:56,223
He didn't say that.

872
01:00:56,432 --> 01:00:58,225
He didn't say he was a robot either.

873
01:00:58,434 --> 01:01:00,936
This is what we've
all been waiting for...

874
01:01:01,145 --> 01:01:04,982
a fight between the Surface
and Metro City.

875
01:01:05,941 --> 01:01:07,276
Let's get it on!

876
01:01:14,742 --> 01:01:16,076
I'm not fighting.

877
01:01:25,294 --> 01:01:26,378
I'm not doing this.

878
01:01:51,862 --> 01:01:53,531
Yeah! Go, Astro!

879
01:02:00,871 --> 01:02:03,374
Bring out the little stinker!

880
01:02:07,461 --> 01:02:09,255
Will you play with us?

881
01:02:09,547 --> 01:02:10,214
Us?

882
01:02:10,798 --> 01:02:12,091
Yes, us.

883
01:02:28,482 --> 01:02:29,400
Hey, fella.

884
01:02:30,151 --> 01:02:31,819
Oh, no!

885
01:02:35,156 --> 01:02:35,865
Oh!

886
01:02:36,699 --> 01:02:39,618
I have a boo-boo.

887
01:02:45,332 --> 01:02:48,335
Get him! Get him!

888
01:02:53,382 --> 01:02:54,550
Go! Go!

889
01:02:55,259 --> 01:02:56,635
- Stand back!
- What are you...

890
01:02:56,844 --> 01:03:00,181
We've got a feather and
we're not afraid to use it.

891
01:03:02,558 --> 01:03:04,185
I may have spoken in haste.

892
01:03:21,202 --> 01:03:24,205
Why fight, brothers?
A great robot once said...

893
01:03:24,997 --> 01:03:26,040
Me schnoz!

894
01:03:45,601 --> 01:03:47,186
Yeah!

895
01:03:54,485 --> 01:03:56,278
We've located Tenma's son, sir.

896
01:03:57,488 --> 01:03:58,823
I win again!

897
01:03:59,031 --> 01:04:02,743
And now, the final challenger.

898
01:04:02,952 --> 01:04:07,623
A robot so fearsome and powerful,
even I'm afraid to watch.

899
01:04:08,791 --> 01:04:13,337
I give you the mighty Zog!

900
01:04:13,546 --> 01:04:14,338
Oh, no.

901
01:04:14,672 --> 01:04:15,339
No.

902
01:04:15,548 --> 01:04:18,217
How will Astro Boy do
against a robot...

903
01:04:18,425 --> 01:04:21,428
powered with
the same energy he's got.

904
01:04:21,846 --> 01:04:23,639
I'm not fighting you, Zog.

905
01:04:27,518 --> 01:04:29,728
I mean it. I won't fight.

906
01:04:35,067 --> 01:04:35,901
Oh, no.

907
01:04:47,163 --> 01:04:48,497
Yeah!

908
01:04:49,832 --> 01:04:53,878
Great! A love-in.
Some big finale. I said fight!

909
01:04:56,964 --> 01:04:58,090
I won't fight.

910
01:04:58,382 --> 01:04:59,175
Fight!

911
01:05:00,009 --> 01:05:00,801
That's enough!

912
01:05:01,010 --> 01:05:03,304
What's wrong with you?
They're just machines!

913
01:05:03,512 --> 01:05:04,472
They'll do what I tell them!

914
01:05:04,680 --> 01:05:06,390
I'm not gonna get embarrassed...

915
01:05:06,599 --> 01:05:08,684
by some souped-up hot-shot
from Metro City...

916
01:05:09,226 --> 01:05:12,646
or a 100-year-old bulldozer
from New Jersey.

917
01:05:12,980 --> 01:05:14,690
I don't think so!

918
01:05:14,899 --> 01:05:17,234
I'm turning you both off!

919
01:05:23,449 --> 01:05:24,116
Stop!

920
01:05:24,325 --> 01:05:25,701
The laws of robotics!

921
01:05:25,910 --> 01:05:29,663
You can't hurt a human!
It's been that way for fifty years!

922
01:05:30,331 --> 01:05:32,291
I'm old school.

923
01:05:35,669 --> 01:05:36,337
Look!

924
01:05:44,553 --> 01:05:46,555
What kind of robot are you?

925
01:05:49,391 --> 01:05:51,435
We've got to recruit the big guy.

926
01:06:05,991 --> 01:06:07,451
What are they doing here?

927
01:06:07,827 --> 01:06:10,746
Seize the rogue robot and
secure the area.

928
01:06:10,955 --> 01:06:12,373
- Hey!
- Come here.

929
01:06:13,707 --> 01:06:15,960
Zog, stop! Put them down.

930
01:06:19,046 --> 01:06:20,381
It doesn't matter anymore.

931
01:06:22,383 --> 01:06:24,385
- I'm okay. I'm okay.
- Come on.

932
01:06:29,598 --> 01:06:31,725
I'm sorry. I tried to tell you.

933
01:06:31,934 --> 01:06:32,685
Keep moving.

934
01:06:34,478 --> 01:06:35,604
Trashcan, no!

935
01:06:37,731 --> 01:06:41,318
Get off me, you dumb robot!

936
01:06:42,361 --> 01:06:43,821
It's okay.

937
01:06:47,408 --> 01:06:48,409
Oh, no.

938
01:06:49,243 --> 01:06:51,829
President Stone's approval rating
reached a new low today...

939
01:06:52,037 --> 01:06:53,581
when he failed to show up for
a televised debate...

940
01:06:53,789 --> 01:06:56,709
with Robert Logan,
the man many pundits are picking...

941
01:06:56,917 --> 01:06:58,752
as the next President of Metro City.

942
01:06:59,336 --> 01:07:01,755
No darn dirty hippie's gonna
sit in my Oval Office...

943
01:07:01,964 --> 01:07:04,508
eating mung beans and
stinking of patchouli oil.

944
01:07:04,758 --> 01:07:06,260
I've got the Blue Core and...

945
01:07:06,469 --> 01:07:09,388
my Peacekeeper's gonna start
a war with the Surface.

946
01:07:09,972 --> 01:07:11,974
That's bound to get me re-elected.

947
01:07:13,100 --> 01:07:17,855
Why the long face, robot boy?
You're going home to your dad.

948
01:07:18,898 --> 01:07:20,274
Care for a drink?

949
01:07:21,901 --> 01:07:23,611
Very funny, Mr. President.

950
01:07:32,620 --> 01:07:36,457
The experiment is over.
I want the Blue Core removed...

951
01:07:36,665 --> 01:07:38,793
and transferred into
the Peacekeeper now.

952
01:07:39,168 --> 01:07:40,836
Will you help me, Elefun?

953
01:07:41,337 --> 01:07:43,172
This is where we created him.

954
01:07:43,380 --> 01:07:45,382
Well, un-create him. Unplug him.

955
01:07:45,716 --> 01:07:47,635
It's a matter of national security.

956
01:07:47,843 --> 01:07:49,220
Let me talk to him first.

957
01:07:52,848 --> 01:07:54,016
Hello, Dr. Elefun.

958
01:07:54,225 --> 01:07:55,351
Hello, Toby.

959
01:07:55,601 --> 01:07:58,312
Nobody's called me Toby for a while.

960
01:07:58,813 --> 01:08:02,399
This isn't your fault.
You're fantastic.

961
01:08:02,608 --> 01:08:05,903
Absolutely first class.
Superb. Wonderful.

962
01:08:06,111 --> 01:08:09,907
Thank you. I tried to find
my place in the world.

963
01:08:11,408 --> 01:08:13,953
I thought I'd found it,
but I guess fitting in...

964
01:08:14,161 --> 01:08:16,288
can be a lot more complicated
than it seems.

965
01:08:16,497 --> 01:08:18,916
Dear boy, if you only knew.

966
01:08:19,667 --> 01:08:21,836
Maybe this is
what's supposed to happen.

967
01:08:22,419 --> 01:08:24,338
This is my destiny.

968
01:08:26,715 --> 01:08:30,010
Oh, boo hoo! It's a machine.

969
01:08:30,219 --> 01:08:32,346
Let's get moving, people.

970
01:08:32,555 --> 01:08:34,723
This is wrong and you know it!

971
01:08:35,015 --> 01:08:39,061
The President is right.
It's just a machine.

972
01:08:40,646 --> 01:08:41,647
Bye, Dr. Elefun.

973
01:08:42,565 --> 01:08:44,441
Load the Blue Core
into the Peacekeeper.

974
01:08:44,650 --> 01:08:47,111
I've got a press conference
scheduled in ten minutes.

975
01:09:29,153 --> 01:09:30,070
I'm sorry.

976
01:09:30,738 --> 01:09:34,867
Don't be. I'm sorry
I couldn't have been a better Toby...

977
01:09:36,285 --> 01:09:37,119
Dad.

978
01:09:40,873 --> 01:09:43,375
Is it done?

979
01:09:47,880 --> 01:09:48,714
It's done.

980
01:09:55,846 --> 01:09:56,555
Good man.

981
01:09:57,014 --> 01:09:59,934
When I'm re-elected,
you can have the funding...

982
01:10:00,142 --> 01:10:02,728
to make as many little toys
as you want.

983
01:10:03,395 --> 01:10:07,233
No. If you want the Core,
you'll have to kill me.

984
01:10:09,235 --> 01:10:11,529
Tenma, no! I created the Core.

985
01:10:11,737 --> 01:10:13,155
They're gonna have to kill me.

986
01:10:13,447 --> 01:10:17,576
I think Metro City can learn
to cope without you. Hand it over.

987
01:10:19,829 --> 01:10:21,205
It appears I don't have it.

988
01:10:21,872 --> 01:10:22,873
Tenma!

989
01:10:26,544 --> 01:10:28,462
Open this!

990
01:10:29,880 --> 01:10:30,840
Open that door!

991
01:10:32,550 --> 01:10:33,676
Oh, please.

992
01:10:38,013 --> 01:10:39,723
I said, open that door!

993
01:10:40,015 --> 01:10:41,433
- Never.
- Now!

994
01:10:44,186 --> 01:10:45,229
Blast.

995
01:10:45,813 --> 01:10:48,107
If you want something done,
you gotta do it yourself.

996
01:10:53,904 --> 01:10:55,865
Whoa... what are you doing?

997
01:10:56,574 --> 01:11:00,035
You may not be Toby,
but you're still my son.

998
01:11:00,244 --> 01:11:00,911
Dad.

999
01:11:06,041 --> 01:11:08,169
Now fly! Fly!

1000
01:11:16,844 --> 01:11:19,722
No! No!

1001
01:11:21,932 --> 01:11:24,477
Arrest them immediately!
I want them shot for treason.

1002
01:11:24,894 --> 01:11:27,271
We need the Peacekeeper to get
the Blue Core back.

1003
01:11:27,480 --> 01:11:29,773
Don't use the Red Core...
the negative energy.

1004
01:11:30,024 --> 01:11:31,525
We can't know how it will behave.

1005
01:11:31,734 --> 01:11:34,403
In conflicts between positive
and negative energy...

1006
01:11:34,612 --> 01:11:38,991
the negative always prevails.
Look at history! Look at me!

1007
01:11:39,200 --> 01:11:40,534
My point exactly.

1008
01:11:40,826 --> 01:11:41,494
Turn this thing on.

1009
01:11:41,702 --> 01:11:42,620
I won't.

1010
01:11:42,828 --> 01:11:45,498
I have fifty reporters
waiting outside! Turn it on!

1011
01:11:45,831 --> 01:11:47,374
You don't understand the technology.

1012
01:11:47,583 --> 01:11:52,046
Technology! Who understands or
cares about technology?

1013
01:11:52,254 --> 01:11:54,965
It's a robot.
It'll do what I say!

1014
01:11:57,051 --> 01:11:58,427
Red Core loaded.

1015
01:11:58,761 --> 01:12:02,973
You ready to do as you're told?
You ready to rock 'n' roll?

1016
01:12:03,182 --> 01:12:03,891
Sir!

1017
01:12:04,350 --> 01:12:08,354
Destroy the boy robot and
bring back the Blue Core.

1018
01:12:12,691 --> 01:12:16,445
Are you deaf?
I said destroy the boy robot...

1019
01:12:18,697 --> 01:12:21,534
and bring back the Blue Core.

1020
01:12:21,909 --> 01:12:23,577
Everybody out! Now!

1021
01:12:24,662 --> 01:12:25,830
Come on! Move it!

1022
01:12:34,338 --> 01:12:38,008
I'm getting word that the President
is slightly delayed.

1023
01:12:47,726 --> 01:12:48,894
Is this thing on?

1024
01:12:51,647 --> 01:12:54,150
Where are you going? Come back!

1025
01:12:54,358 --> 01:12:58,279
Monster, stand down by
order of President Stone.

1026
01:13:02,491 --> 01:13:05,494
This is the life.
Smooth sailing.

1027
01:13:05,661 --> 01:13:07,580
Whoa!

1028
01:13:07,913 --> 01:13:08,706
Sorry!

1029
01:13:08,914 --> 01:13:11,834
It's that crazy flying kid again!

1030
01:13:12,042 --> 01:13:16,422
I'm a robot, like you.
What are you doing way out here?

1031
01:13:16,630 --> 01:13:18,841
We got tired of the rat race.
We dropped out.

1032
01:13:19,049 --> 01:13:21,719
We're trying to live more natural,
like real birds.

1033
01:13:23,429 --> 01:13:24,221
What's that?

1034
01:13:24,430 --> 01:13:28,976
You know how humans are.
New Years, 4th of July, Mothers' Day.

1035
01:13:29,185 --> 01:13:30,060
We've got to do something.

1036
01:13:30,269 --> 01:13:33,147
Help the humans?
We're robots. It's not our problem.

1037
01:13:33,355 --> 01:13:35,733
Forget about them.
What did they ever do for us?

1038
01:13:43,449 --> 01:13:46,452
He's right. The rules of robotics
say we gotta help.

1039
01:13:47,578 --> 01:13:51,499
A squeezy bottle's gotta do what
a squeezy bottle's gotta do.

1040
01:13:56,086 --> 01:13:59,215
Come out, come out,
wherever you are!

1041
01:14:08,599 --> 01:14:11,227
Where are you, robot boy?

1042
01:14:15,731 --> 01:14:16,398
Oh, no.

1043
01:14:21,445 --> 01:14:22,780
There you are.

1044
01:14:33,999 --> 01:14:35,334
What?

1045
01:14:36,961 --> 01:14:37,878
Cool!

1046
01:14:50,307 --> 01:14:51,809
That has to be Astro.

1047
01:14:52,226 --> 01:14:54,728
I don't care if he's a robot.
I miss him.

1048
01:14:54,937 --> 01:14:55,896
I hear you.

1049
01:14:59,233 --> 01:15:02,153
When the going gets tough,
smart people take a hike.

1050
01:15:02,361 --> 01:15:05,406
Bye, kids. What do you want,
an apology?

1051
01:15:05,614 --> 01:15:07,116
Nope. Just the car.

1052
01:15:07,324 --> 01:15:09,869
I would love to oblige you, but...

1053
01:15:12,746 --> 01:15:17,793
I love you guys!
Please, call off the freaking robot!

1054
01:15:22,965 --> 01:15:23,674
Gotcha!

1055
01:15:32,683 --> 01:15:35,519
This city elected me!

1056
01:15:35,728 --> 01:15:36,479
I own it!

1057
01:15:36,687 --> 01:15:38,230
It's mine!

1058
01:15:47,907 --> 01:15:49,783
Hey! I'm voting for the other guy!

1059
01:15:57,249 --> 01:15:58,709
Thank you. Anytime you need me.

1060
01:16:12,640 --> 01:16:13,307
What?

1061
01:16:15,768 --> 01:16:18,687
I've got machine guns... in my butt?

1062
01:16:21,565 --> 01:16:22,608
You gotta be kidding.

1063
01:16:22,817 --> 01:16:24,151
Batter up!

1064
01:16:28,948 --> 01:16:30,199
Home run!

1065
01:16:50,010 --> 01:16:50,886
Astro?

1066
01:16:51,554 --> 01:16:52,221
Cora?

1067
01:16:53,639 --> 01:16:56,767
Thanks, guys.
Hey, who's driving?

1068
01:17:05,359 --> 01:17:06,610
Trashcan, drive faster!

1069
01:17:08,279 --> 01:17:09,113
Move over!

1070
01:17:35,139 --> 01:17:36,015
Are we going up?

1071
01:17:36,223 --> 01:17:37,600
The city's going down!

1072
01:17:37,808 --> 01:17:39,643
I have to take care of this.

1073
01:17:39,852 --> 01:17:41,061
Astro! No!

1074
01:17:41,812 --> 01:17:43,063
Astro!

1075
01:17:49,570 --> 01:17:50,488
Look!

1076
01:18:03,375 --> 01:18:05,711
Right then, comrades. To arms!

1077
01:18:05,920 --> 01:18:07,713
I've got three arms.

1078
01:18:23,187 --> 01:18:24,021
Where is he?

1079
01:18:24,438 --> 01:18:25,648
Will he be okay?

1080
01:18:25,856 --> 01:18:27,024
I hope so.

1081
01:18:33,155 --> 01:18:34,907
Hey! Ugly!

1082
01:18:35,866 --> 01:18:37,076
Down here!

1083
01:18:37,576 --> 01:18:39,954
We demand immediately that
you cease oppressing...

1084
01:18:40,162 --> 01:18:43,707
our comrade, Astro.
We may not be able to harm humans...

1085
01:18:43,916 --> 01:18:48,420
but nothing says we
can't seriously damage a monster.

1086
01:18:48,629 --> 01:18:49,755
Right, comrades?

1087
01:18:53,884 --> 01:18:55,219
Look over there!

1088
01:18:57,596 --> 01:19:01,016
Where are you, robot boy?
I know you're still alive.

1089
01:19:01,517 --> 01:19:03,060
You can't hide from...

1090
01:19:07,606 --> 01:19:08,899
Is that all you got?

1091
01:19:17,032 --> 01:19:17,950
Come here!

1092
01:19:21,245 --> 01:19:25,249
Party's over, kid.
Blue Core obtained.

1093
01:19:46,395 --> 01:19:47,229
Toby!

1094
01:19:47,771 --> 01:19:48,606
Dad!

1095
01:19:51,609 --> 01:19:54,403
I don't understand.
Why didn't it absorb me?

1096
01:19:54,612 --> 01:19:55,738
Because it can't.

1097
01:19:55,946 --> 01:20:00,534
If the Red and Blue Cores
come together, you'll both die.

1098
01:20:02,536 --> 01:20:04,538
Come on, son.
We need to get far away.

1099
01:20:05,956 --> 01:20:06,832
Where are you, Astro?

1100
01:20:09,960 --> 01:20:12,254
Where's your robot friend?
Where is he?

1101
01:20:14,048 --> 01:20:17,009
I've got an election to win
and I want that Core.

1102
01:20:21,263 --> 01:20:23,182
Tell me where he's hiding!

1103
01:20:23,390 --> 01:20:25,267
Do you hear me? Where is he?

1104
01:20:25,476 --> 01:20:26,644
We have to go.

1105
01:20:27,061 --> 01:20:30,606
This is it.
This is why I was created.

1106
01:20:31,065 --> 01:20:33,484
This is my destiny.

1107
01:20:33,692 --> 01:20:35,027
Toby, now!

1108
01:20:35,236 --> 01:20:37,029
I'm sorry, but this is who I am.

1109
01:20:37,780 --> 01:20:41,117
Onward and upward, Dad.

1110
01:20:41,325 --> 01:20:42,201
No!

1111
01:20:44,662 --> 01:20:46,330
You're back for more?

1112
01:20:54,046 --> 01:20:56,298
Wait! No, no!

1113
01:21:00,261 --> 01:21:00,928
No!

1114
01:21:11,605 --> 01:21:13,023
- My son.
- Dad.

1115
01:21:20,114 --> 01:21:22,241
Get out of me now!

1116
01:21:23,576 --> 01:21:24,452
Get out!

1117
01:21:25,786 --> 01:21:27,246
- Get us out of here!
- I'm trying!

1118
01:21:30,082 --> 01:21:32,042
No! No! No!

1119
01:21:33,627 --> 01:21:35,212
Nuts.

1120
01:21:43,929 --> 01:21:44,763
Son.

1121
01:22:06,160 --> 01:22:08,287
Seize this girl immediately.
She kicked me!

1122
01:22:08,496 --> 01:22:09,705
She can't kick me!

1123
01:22:09,914 --> 01:22:12,416
Sir, you're under arrest.

1124
01:22:12,750 --> 01:22:15,169
You can't do this to me!

1125
01:22:15,586 --> 01:22:18,839
- Astro!
- Astro!

1126
01:22:22,593 --> 01:22:23,344
Astro!

1127
01:22:26,514 --> 01:22:27,431
Oh, no.

1128
01:22:31,435 --> 01:22:32,645
Oh, Astro.

1129
01:22:32,937 --> 01:22:34,563
Who was he?

1130
01:22:34,772 --> 01:22:36,649
That robot saved the whole city.

1131
01:22:36,857 --> 01:22:38,150
Why would he care?

1132
01:22:38,651 --> 01:22:42,196
Because that robot had more
humanity than most of us.

1133
01:22:43,113 --> 01:22:44,281
Who are you?

1134
01:22:44,490 --> 01:22:46,867
I'm a friend of his from the Surface.

1135
01:22:47,076 --> 01:22:48,577
You're from the Surface?

1136
01:22:53,457 --> 01:22:54,792
Can you fix him?

1137
01:22:55,084 --> 01:22:59,088
I'm afraid not.
His Blue Core was unique.

1138
01:23:00,131 --> 01:23:01,715
It has died with him.

1139
01:23:02,299 --> 01:23:05,678
It's not fair.
All he ever did was help people.

1140
01:23:05,886 --> 01:23:07,304
Not just people.

1141
01:23:09,557 --> 01:23:11,225
Astro brought Zog back to life.

1142
01:23:11,433 --> 01:23:12,101
How?

1143
01:23:12,810 --> 01:23:14,019
The blue stuff.

1144
01:23:15,688 --> 01:23:17,815
Do you have any of that
blue stuff left?

1145
01:23:19,525 --> 01:23:22,236
Do you think you could
spare some for our friend?

1146
01:23:55,978 --> 01:23:57,146
Mommy, look!

1147
01:23:58,063 --> 01:24:01,275
Dad? Cora? What happened?

1148
01:24:01,525 --> 01:24:02,860
Is the Peacekeeper gone?

1149
01:24:03,068 --> 01:24:03,736
Yes.

1150
01:24:08,199 --> 01:24:10,743
But, but how am I still alive?

1151
01:24:15,623 --> 01:24:16,707
Thank you, Zog.

1152
01:24:17,333 --> 01:24:18,125
It was no biggie.

1153
01:24:26,509 --> 01:24:30,763
I think you've finally found
your place in the world.

1154
01:24:31,096 --> 01:24:35,017
You're a hero.
A robot with the heart of a lion.

1155
01:24:35,309 --> 01:24:37,019
And everyone finally knows it.

1156
01:24:44,819 --> 01:24:46,821
I love happy endings.

1157
01:24:47,905 --> 01:24:49,532
- Would you?
- Sure.

1158
01:24:50,199 --> 01:24:51,117
Thanks.

1159
01:24:52,159 --> 01:24:52,952
Cora!

1160
01:24:53,828 --> 01:24:55,496
Cora! Cora!

1161
01:24:55,704 --> 01:24:56,622
Mom? Dad?

1162
01:24:56,831 --> 01:24:58,082
Where have you been, sweetie?

1163
01:24:58,290 --> 01:24:59,500
We searched high and low for you.

1164
01:24:59,708 --> 01:25:00,459
Really?

1165
01:25:06,048 --> 01:25:07,716
Viva La Roboto-lution!

1166
01:25:07,925 --> 01:25:10,386
It looks like all
the interesting stuff is over.

1167
01:25:10,594 --> 01:25:11,971
Typical.

1168
01:25:12,471 --> 01:25:13,639
Thanks for your help, guys.

1169
01:25:13,806 --> 01:25:14,890
It was nothing.

1170
01:25:15,182 --> 01:25:18,811
When you think about it,
it really was... nothing.

1171
01:25:19,186 --> 01:25:21,188
Are you trying to upset me?

1172
01:25:22,690 --> 01:25:24,900
Will you be wanting the car, sir?

1173
01:25:25,109 --> 01:25:27,903
I don't want you
to call me "sir" anymore, Orrin.

1174
01:25:28,112 --> 01:25:32,616
In fact, take the day off.
Enjoy a day with the robot ladies.

1175
01:25:33,451 --> 01:25:35,536
Thank you, Dr. Tenma.

1176
01:25:35,828 --> 01:25:36,912
Call me Bill.

1177
01:25:39,415 --> 01:25:41,083
I am so freaked out right now.

1178
01:25:46,213 --> 01:25:49,258
Take cover! We're under alien attack!

1179
01:25:51,760 --> 01:25:54,388
Wait. Are you sure
you're ready for this, Astro?

1180
01:25:54,597 --> 01:25:56,223
I was made ready.
