00:16:45,338 --> 00:16:46,588
Who are you?

181
00:16:48,091 --> 00:16:50,967
I am the President of the--
I'm Artemus Gordon.

182
00:16:51,886 --> 00:16:53,261
How did you know?

183
00:16:55,223 --> 00:16:57,933
The President went to West Point.
That says Harvard.

184
00:16:58,142 --> 00:16:59,768
Very observant.

185
00:17:02,939 --> 00:17:05,190
Somebody mind telling me
what's going on?

186
00:17:05,650 --> 00:17:07,025
President Grant, um....

187
00:17:08,695 --> 00:17:10,445
Sir, these are perilous times.

188
00:17:10,947 --> 00:17:14,408
I was merely demonstrating how someone,
using the art of disguise...

189
00:17:14,659 --> 00:17:18,745
...could penetrate into the very bowels
of the White House, sir.

190
00:17:18,996 --> 00:17:22,374
You're clever, Gordon.
One day it's going to get you killed.

191
00:17:23,251 --> 00:17:24,793
Like today.

192
00:17:26,337 --> 00:17:30,841
And, West, not every situation calls for
your approach of "shoot first...

193
00:17:31,092 --> 00:17:32,843
...shoot later, shoot some more...

194
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:36,221
...then when everybody's dead,
try to ask a question or two."

195
00:17:36,848 --> 00:17:38,223
Working together will be good.

196
00:17:38,433 --> 00:17:40,600
-Working together?
-With all due respect--

197
00:17:40,852 --> 00:17:43,729
You'll work the way your
Commander in Chief tells you to.

198
00:17:44,147 --> 00:17:46,440
Well, I was coming to that, sir.

199
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:58,285
GRANT:
Gentlemen, America's top scientists...

200
00:17:58,536 --> 00:18:01,288
...in the fields of physics,
hydraulics, explosives...

201
00:18:01,539 --> 00:18:06,126
...all kidnapped in the last year,
and all by General McGrath, it now appears.

202
00:18:06,502 --> 00:18:09,546
You two have been working
on the same case the whole time.

203
00:18:10,214 --> 00:18:12,340
Why did it take so long
to figure it out?

204
00:18:12,592 --> 00:18:16,470
One of us was trying to catch McGrath,
and the other was trying to marry him.

205
00:18:16,721 --> 00:18:18,096
GRANT:
We don't have time for this.

206
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:21,349
Only one week, if we believe this.

207
00:18:22,518 --> 00:18:24,853
"General Grant,
the scientists you seek...

208
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:27,647
...are in my employ creating
a weapons system...

209
00:18:27,857 --> 00:18:30,317
...beyond the pale
of contemporary imagination.

210
00:18:30,568 --> 00:18:32,986
I suggest you put
your affairs in order.

211
00:18:33,196 --> 00:18:36,865
You have one week before you will
surrender the U.S. government."

212
00:18:37,241 --> 00:18:40,160
The letter was delivered today
with that cake.

213
00:18:42,914 --> 00:18:45,207
-It's marzipan, isn't it?
GRANT: Careful.

214
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,252
It's McGrath, sir.

215
00:18:49,462 --> 00:18:52,714
McGrath may be a vicious killer,
but a mastermind he is not.

216
00:18:53,341 --> 00:18:56,176
So whom do we seek?
After consulting with Intelligence--

217
00:18:56,427 --> 00:18:59,346
McGrath is on his way to New Orleans.
The longer we stay here...

218
00:18:59,597 --> 00:19:01,973
...the farther he gets.
I don't need Intelligence.

219
00:19:02,225 --> 00:19:03,850
You'd rather rely on stupidity.

220
00:19:04,101 --> 00:19:05,936
I am leaving today for Utah...

221
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:10,065
...where the transcontinental railroads
will be joined at Promontory Point.

222
00:19:10,775 --> 00:19:12,567
You two are the best I've got.

223
00:19:12,777 --> 00:19:14,778
Put aside your differences...

224
00:19:14,987 --> 00:19:18,532
...and find this madman,
whoever he is, and stop him.

225
00:19:19,283 --> 00:19:20,867
You have one week.

226
00:19:21,369 --> 00:19:22,410
Dismissed.

227
00:19:30,503 --> 00:19:31,545
Gentlemen.

228
00:19:31,879 --> 00:19:33,839
The Wanderer is at your disposal.

229
00:19:34,131 --> 00:19:36,216
Engine number five, track six.

230
00:19:36,467 --> 00:19:39,427
Mr. Gordon, the item you requested.

231
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:41,263
Thank you.

232
00:19:46,602 --> 00:19:48,687
-Figures.
-My new invention.

233
00:19:48,896 --> 00:19:53,817
The Bi-Valve Interior Combustion
Twice-Exhausted Bi-Axle Nitro-Cycle.

234
00:19:54,068 --> 00:19:56,945
Save it. Got a train to catch. Hyah!

235
00:19:59,949 --> 00:20:01,992
Not if I catch it first.

236
00:20:07,957 --> 00:20:09,207
Avanti!

237
00:20:25,057 --> 00:20:26,600
Nice horse!

238
00:20:47,705 --> 00:20:49,247
WEST:
Gordon!

239
00:20:50,416 --> 00:20:51,666
Gordon!

240
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:56,838
Stop the train!

241
00:21:03,346 --> 00:21:05,555
Hey! I'm warning you!

242
00:21:05,806 --> 00:21:07,265
Gordon! Stop the train!

243
00:21:07,892 --> 00:21:09,893
Come in. Have a seat.

244
00:21:10,144 --> 00:21:11,978
Stop the train!

245
00:21:12,229 --> 00:21:14,314
Stop smiling at me!

246
00:21:20,112 --> 00:21:21,571
[YELLS]

247
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:26,451
How nice of you to drop in.

248
00:21:27,203 --> 00:21:28,411
All right....

249
00:21:30,039 --> 00:21:33,959
Let's drop the beards, the bikes,
the fake boobies.

250
00:21:34,210 --> 00:21:37,337
Let's set that needlepoint aside
and handle this like men.

251
00:21:37,588 --> 00:21:40,882
As a matter of clarification,
this is not needlepoint.

252
00:21:41,676 --> 00:21:43,176
This is needlepoint.

253
00:21:43,844 --> 00:21:46,513
I'm putting the final touches
on my latest invention.

254
00:21:46,764 --> 00:21:48,848
I call it The Impermeable.

255
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:50,892
It's a vest.
When worn under clothing...

256
00:21:51,143 --> 00:21:54,229
...it can stop any bullet,
fired even at close range.

257
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,815
-Is that so?
-But I haven't tested it fully yet.

258
00:21:56,983 --> 00:21:58,024
Guns.

259
00:21:58,484 --> 00:22:02,696
I find them primitive and unnecessary
if one's done one's proper planning.

260
00:22:02,947 --> 00:22:07,367
I have always felt that allowing any
situation to degenerate into violence...

261
00:22:07,618 --> 00:22:09,661
...constitutes a failure on my part.

262
00:22:09,912 --> 00:22:10,996
Well, Mr. Gordon...

263
00:22:11,539 --> 00:22:12,706
...you failed.

264
00:22:18,462 --> 00:22:20,964
All right, Mr. West,
we'll settle this...

265
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:23,091
...like men.

266
00:22:25,928 --> 00:22:29,055
[GRUNTING]

267
00:22:37,898 --> 00:22:39,441
Ding!

268
00:22:44,864 --> 00:22:46,489
I love this train.

269
00:22:49,785 --> 00:22:50,910
-Cheers!
-Gordon!

270
00:22:51,996 --> 00:22:54,414
While you're down there,
feel free to make use...

271
00:22:54,665 --> 00:22:57,584
...of my Sub-Carriage Inter-Rail
Vehicular Egressor.

272
00:22:58,044 --> 00:22:59,794
I designed it myself!

273
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:06,217
I've been thinking.
Maybe the president's right.

274
00:23:06,469 --> 00:23:10,221
We should put aside our differences
and work together.

275
00:23:12,391 --> 00:23:16,102
Fight each other all you please.
Harm my train, I'll douse you like dogs.

276
00:23:16,353 --> 00:23:18,313
That's my truffle reduction sauce.

277
00:23:18,773 --> 00:23:22,192
Let's get on about our
president's business, shall we?

278
00:23:22,735 --> 00:23:24,152
-Where to?
-New Orleans.

279
00:23:24,445 --> 00:23:26,738
-Why don't we let Professor Morton decide?
WEST: Who?

280
00:23:26,989 --> 00:23:30,283
I don't need some nobody professor
telling me where to head.

281
00:23:31,327 --> 00:23:35,413
Meet Professor Thaddeus Morton,
kidnapped from M.I.T. six months ago.

282
00:23:35,664 --> 00:23:40,293
Expert in the field of metallurgy.
Discovered in a field of alfalfa.

283
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:42,462
That's a man's head.

284
00:23:42,963 --> 00:23:47,175
This magnetic collar was found about
six feet away, near his body.

285
00:23:47,426 --> 00:23:49,219
Still trying to figure that out.

286
00:23:49,470 --> 00:23:50,595
That's a man's head.

287
00:23:51,222 --> 00:23:55,391
According to the Retinal Terminus
Theory, a dying person's last image...

288
00:23:55,643 --> 00:23:58,937
...burns into his eyeball like a photo.
Perhaps there's a clue.

289
00:23:59,188 --> 00:24:02,315
I give you Morton's last image.

290
00:24:02,566 --> 00:24:06,069
That's a man's head.

291
00:24:14,203 --> 00:24:18,790
Refraction of the lenses causes the image
to appear upside down, so we simply....

292
00:24:27,758 --> 00:24:28,800
That...

293
00:24:29,510 --> 00:24:31,761
...is a man's...

294
00:24:34,932 --> 00:24:35,974
...head.

295
00:24:37,017 --> 00:24:38,059
Voilà!

296
00:24:40,104 --> 00:24:41,146
McGrath.

297
00:24:41,313 --> 00:24:43,857
Something's in his pocket.
It's too fuzzy to see.

298
00:24:44,108 --> 00:24:46,359
Mortification of the aqueous humor's
led to a loss--

299
00:24:46,610 --> 00:24:47,694
Glasses.

300
00:24:53,993 --> 00:24:58,288
"Friends of the South, come to
a costume ball, April 14, half past 8.

301
00:24:58,539 --> 00:25:00,165

302
00:25:01,167 --> 00:25:02,709
BOTH:

Gypsy queen...pirate....

304
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:22,854
Ah. How about this?
Come as my manservant.

305
00:25:23,522 --> 00:25:25,440
Why, yes'um, Master Gordon!

306
00:25:25,691 --> 00:25:29,611
I swears I'd be delighted!
I sing, I dance for you, sir.

307
00:25:29,862 --> 00:25:33,990
I swears none of the white folks'll
know I'd rather shoot myself...

308
00:25:34,241 --> 00:25:36,326
...than play your damn manservant.

309
00:25:36,535 --> 00:25:38,578
You must wear something.
It's a costume party.

310
00:25:38,787 --> 00:25:40,538
This is all I need to wear.

311
00:25:40,789 --> 00:25:42,790
If you insist on a firearm,
I have something...

312
00:25:43,042 --> 00:25:45,710
...you'll find intriguing.
I designed it to go...

313
00:25:46,003 --> 00:25:47,545
...with this.

314
00:25:48,839 --> 00:25:50,840
Jim West does not wear costumes.

315
00:25:51,133 --> 00:25:52,717
Very well. What's your plan?

316
00:25:52,968 --> 00:25:56,012
I was thinking I'd go
as a government agent...

317
00:25:56,263 --> 00:25:58,389
...who'll kill
General Bloodbath McGrath.

318
00:25:58,641 --> 00:26:02,602
An armed, Negro cowboy costume in a
room full of white former slave owners.

319
00:26:02,853 --> 00:26:04,187
You'll win first prize.

320
00:26:04,396 --> 00:26:07,982
Listen, the art of disguise
is what we need to get into the party...

321
00:26:08,234 --> 00:26:10,193
...to find the kidnapped scientists...

322
00:26:10,444 --> 00:26:13,988
...before they're forced to create
something that'll destroy the U.S.

323
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:16,991
You and I have been handpicked
by the president.

324
00:26:17,243 --> 00:26:20,954
Our freedom is at stake,
and this is our duty as men.

325
00:26:21,205 --> 00:26:23,957
You go as a riverboat captain,
and I'll be a saloon girl.

326
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:27,418
Let me tell you something about
your art of disguise.

327
00:26:27,670 --> 00:26:31,047
That night at Fat-Can's, it wasn't difficult
to see you weren't a woman.

328
00:26:31,757 --> 00:26:33,132
I was propositioned by three men.

329
00:26:33,384 --> 00:26:34,801
You looked nasty.

330
00:26:35,052 --> 00:26:36,678
Just butt-ugly.

331
00:26:36,929 --> 00:26:39,555
I mean, your breasts
were hard and stiff...

332
00:26:39,807 --> 00:26:42,934
...and stuck out like a couple
of rusty cannons on a sunken ship.

333
00:26:43,185 --> 00:26:45,561
These breasts are a work of art.

334
00:26:45,813 --> 00:26:48,189
Aesthetically
and scientifically perfect.

335
00:26:48,607 --> 00:26:49,899
They look like shit.

336
00:26:52,152 --> 00:26:53,653
-Touch them.
-I'm not touching those.

337
00:26:53,904 --> 00:26:55,697
GORDON: Afraid you're wrong?
Touch my breasts!

338
00:26:55,948 --> 00:26:57,740
Just one. Touch one!

339
00:26:59,368 --> 00:27:00,660
WEST:
Happy? I'm touching them.

340
00:27:00,911 --> 00:27:02,036
I knew it!

341
00:27:02,288 --> 00:27:03,705
GORDON:
Squeeze it gently.

342
00:27:04,039 --> 00:27:07,417
Not that hard! Now you've shifted
all the buckwheat around.

343
00:27:07,835 --> 00:27:09,294
Buckwheat? That's your problem.

344
00:27:10,671 --> 00:27:11,713
What are you doing?

345
00:27:22,975 --> 00:27:24,142
Now touch my breast.

346
00:27:28,105 --> 00:27:31,274
-Oh.
-Eh? That's what a breast should feel like.

347
00:27:31,525 --> 00:27:32,650
Very nice.

348
00:27:33,027 --> 00:27:36,446
WEST: Now touch yourself.
GORDON: Oh, my God, I'm hard!

349
00:27:40,909 --> 00:27:42,618
I was just gonna jot down a note.

350

That would be nice.

Loveless kidnapped
a few metallurgists...

697

...so whatever he's building
will have armor.

698

He kidnapped a couple chemists...

699
00:53:48,851 --> 00:53:50,226
...so it'll have explosives.

world's foremost expert in hydraulics...

...so the thing's gonna move.

702
00:53:57,151 --> 00:54:01,029
What could he build that'd make
the president surrender the government?

703
00:54:01,739 --> 00:54:03,072
A bedside heater.

704

Rita needs a bedside heater.
It gets quite chilly.
