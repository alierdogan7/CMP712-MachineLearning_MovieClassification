<i>Mr. Bond will have a vodka martini.
Shaken, not stirred.</i>

<i>Mrs. Carver will have a tequila.
Straight shot.</i>

<i>No. Mrs. Carver will have a glass
of Mr. Carver's champagne.</i>

<i>- I see you've moved up in the world.
- And tonight you're a banker.</i>

328
00:33:24,836 --> 00:33:27,464
<i>I saw the guest list.</i>

329
00:33:27,923 --> 00:33:30,927
<i>Tell me, James, do you still sleep
with a gun under your pillow?</i>

330
00:33:42,979 --> 00:33:45,653
<i>- To you.
- No. To the gun.</i>

331
00:33:52,113 --> 00:33:56,368
<i>- I take it this isn't a social visit.
- Your husband may be in trouble.</i>

332
00:33:56,952 --> 00:34:01,799
<i>"The Emperor of the air." If you think of
going after him, you're the one in trouble.</i>

333
00:34:01,873 --> 00:34:05,628
<i>Perhaps, but it's either him
or someone in his organization.</i>

334
00:34:05,961 --> 00:34:08,965
<i>I see. And you figured you could
charm the dirt out of me.</i>

335
00:34:09,047 --> 00:34:13,223
<i>- No. That wasn't my plan.
- Good.</i>

336
00:34:13,301 --> 00:34:16,726
<i>If it comes to a choice between
you and Elliot, I've made my bed.</i>

337
00:34:17,138 --> 00:34:19,015
<i>You don't sleep in it anymore.</i>

338
00:34:19,641 --> 00:34:22,485
<i>There you are.</i>

339
00:34:23,395 --> 00:34:24,988
<i>Darling.</i>

340

<i>I've been looking everywhere for you.</i>

341
00:34:30,068 --> 00:34:32,992
<i>I want you to meet Wai Lin,
New China News Agency.</i>

342
00:34:33,822 --> 00:34:35,824
<i>- Hello, Mrs. Carver.
- It's a pleasure.</i>

343
00:34:36,908 --> 00:34:41,038
<i>- And this is James Bond.
- I didn't realize you knew each other.</i>

344
00:34:41,329 --> 00:34:43,707
<i>- We're old friends.
- Casual acquaintances.</i>

345
00:34:43,790 --> 00:34:45,838
<i>He dated my roommate in Zurich.</i>

346
00:34:47,711 --> 00:34:50,806
<i>I'm thinking of getting
Wai Lin behind a news desk.</i>

347
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:55,351
<i>That's wonderful.
I'm sure she won't resist too much.</i>

348
00:34:58,763 --> 00:35:02,984
<i>I was just wondering about your satellites,
the way you positioned yourself globally.</i>

349
00:35:03,059 --> 00:35:05,938
<i>They're merely tools
for information, Mr. Bond.</i>

350
00:35:06,021 --> 00:35:07,614
<i>Or disinformation.</i>

351
00:35:07,689 --> 00:35:12,069
<i>Say, if you wanted to manipulate
the course of governments. Or people.</i>

352
00:35:12,736 --> 00:35:14,204

354
00:35:16,239 --> 00:35:19,038
<i>That's very interesting, Mr. Bond.</i>

355
00:35:19,117 --> 00:35:22,792
<i>You have a vivid imagination for a banker.</i>

356
00:35:22,871 --> 00:35:25,340
<i>I should commission you to write a novel.</i>

357
00:35:25,415 --> 00:35:29,340
<i>Heavens, no. I'd be lost at sea. Adrift.</i>

<i>Excuse me. Darling?</i>

362
00:35:47,312 --> 00:35:51,988
<i>- So, how do you really know him?
- I told you. He's a banker I met in Zurich.</i>

00:35:52,067 --> 00:35:53,740
<i>You're a terrible liar, dear.</i>

364

365
00:36:00,241 --> 00:36:01,709

do you specialize in, Mr. Bond?</i>

369
00:36:19,678 --> 00:36:22,932
<i>Hostile takeovers. Shall we?</i>

370
00:36:33,608 --> 00:36:36,532
<i>Carver must feel at home
in a room like this.</i>

371

<i>It's nice to talk to the world.</i>

372

<i>Mr. Bond, you have an urgent phone call.</i>

<i>Good evening. Tonight's broadcast

<i>marking the completion of
the Carver Global Satellite Network.</i>

377
00:37:12,856 --> 00:37:18,534
<i>But, as you're well aware, terrible conflict
looms tonight in the South China Sea,</i>

00:37:48,641 --> 00:37:52,396
<i>Herr Stamper, we have made contact.</i>

385
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:57,401
<i>Make him uncomfortable.
I'll be there in a few moments.</i>

00:38:08,328 --> 00:38:12,083
<i>You seem very concerned
about Mr. Carver's business.</i>

389

<i>He wants to know why.</i>

390
00:38:15,919 --> 00:38:18,638
<i>Why did I do it, you ask.</i>

391
00:38:18,963 --> 00:38:21,637
<i>The answer is simple: power.</i>

392
00:38:22,717 --> 00:38:27,518
<i>The power to illuminate the far corners
of the globe, not for higher profits,</i>

393

<i>but for higher understanding
between the people of this great planet.</i>

<i>Put him in the chair.
Maybe we play a number on his head.</i>

395
00:38:42,779 --> 00:38:47,455
<i>And what do I expect in return?
Worldwide domination.</i>

396
00:38:47,534 --> 00:38:51,289
<i>Complete, utter, total
worldwide domination.</i>

397
00:38:51,412 --> 00:38:55,007
<i>But not over governments

<i>And you become the new

653
01:14:41,602 --> 01:14:45,903

Napoleon had his armies,</i>

01:55:07,776 --> 01:55:09,278
<i>Let's stay undercover.</i>

967
01:55:39,933 --> 01:55:43,904
<i>Your life is a story</i>

968
01:55:45,272 --> 01:55:49,027
<i>I've already written</i>

969
01:55:50,527 --> 01:55:56,751
<i>The news is that I am in control</i>

970
01:56:01,288 --> 01:56:05,043

971
01:56:06,168 --> 01:56:09,889
<i>To make you surrender</i>

972
01:56:11,381 --> 01:56:18,390
<i>Not only your body but your soul</i>

973
01:56:19,222 --> 01:56:22,567
<i>Tomorrow never dies</i>

974
01:56:23,018 --> 01:56:24,486
<i>Surrender</i>

975
01:56:24,561 --> 01:56:29,533
<i>Tomorrow will arrive on time</i>

976
01:56:29,608 --> 01:56:36,036
<i>I'll tease and tantalize with every line</i>

977
01:56:36,114 --> 01:56:40,164
<i>Till you are mine</i>

978
01:56:40,243 --> 01:56:44,714
<i>Tomorrow never dies</i>

979
01:56:53,048 --> 01:56:56,803
<i>Whatever you're after</i>

980
01:56:58,261 --> 01:57:02,016
<i>Trust me - I'll deliver</i>

981
01:57:03,558 --> 01:57:10,362
<i>You relish the world that I create</i>

982
01:57:11,399 --> 01:57:15,074
<i>Tomorrow never dies</i>

983
01:57:15,153 --> 01:57:16,450
<i>Surrender</i>

984
01:57:16,530 --> 01:57:21,582
<i>Tomorrow will arrive on time</i>

985
01:57:21,660 --> 01:57:28,134
<i>I'll tease and tantalize with every line</i>

986
01:57:28,208 --> 01:57:32,054
<i>Till you are mine</i>

987
01:57:32,128 --> 01:57:36,975
<i>Tomorrow never dies</i>

988
01:57:38,677 --> 01:57:47,779
<i>The truth is now what I say</i>

989
01:57:49,020 --> 01:57:57,326
<i>I've taken care of yesterday</i>

990
01:57:57,988 --> 01:58:01,788
<i>Tomorrow never dies</i>

991
01:58:01,866 --> 01:58:03,163
<i>Surrender</i>

992
01:58:03,243 --> 01:58:08,249
<i>Tomorrow will arrive on time</i>

993
01:58:08,331 --> 01:58:14,634
<i>I'll tease and tantalize with every line</i>

994
01:58:14,713 --> 01:58:18,718
<i>Till you are mine</i>

995
01:58:18,800 --> 01:58:23,800
<i>Tomorrow never dies</i>
