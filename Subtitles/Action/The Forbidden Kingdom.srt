00:15:48,279 --> 00:15:50,048
I'm Jason.

187
00:15:50,049 --> 00:15:51,852
Jason Tripitikas,
from South Boston.

188
00:15:53,690 --> 00:15:55,760
Is this a dream?

189
00:15:55,761 --> 00:15:57,564
No.

190
00:15:57,565 --> 00:16:00,503
Where you came from
is the dream...

191
00:16:00,504 --> 00:16:03,442
through the gate
of no gate.

192
00:16:03,443 --> 00:16:06,181
Is that like a wormhole
or something?

193
00:16:06,182 --> 00:16:08,252
No. It means
you are either a Zen Master...

194
00:16:09,957 --> 00:16:11,625
or you carry something
very special.

195
00:16:11,626 --> 00:16:13,897
This?

196
00:16:13,898 --> 00:16:14,966
It was in a pawn shop,

197
00:16:14,967 --> 00:16:16,134
waiting for a man
to pick it up

198
00:16:16,135 --> 00:16:19,140
and return it
to its rightful owner.

199
00:16:20,511 --> 00:16:21,245
What?

200
00:16:22,782 --> 00:16:25,687
It's long been foretold

201
00:16:25,688 --> 00:16:27,958
that a seeker will come

202
00:16:27,959 --> 00:16:32,668
to return the staff and end
the reign of the Jade Warlord.

203
00:16:32,669 --> 00:16:34,105
Return the staff to who?

204
00:16:35,275 --> 00:16:36,810
The Monkey King.

205
00:16:36,811 --> 00:16:39,615
Born of a stone

206
00:16:39,616 --> 00:16:42,956
on the mountain
of fruit and flowers.

207
00:16:42,957 --> 00:16:45,027
With his weapon in hand,

208
00:16:45,028 --> 00:16:47,999
his Chi became like fire,
[shouting]

209
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,638
his stick fighting
like magic.

210
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:52,309
He defied the order
of the land...

211
00:16:53,478 --> 00:16:55,682
but the Jade Army
could not defeat him.

212
00:17:03,265 --> 00:17:04,599
MONKEY KING: Ooh!

213
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:05,936
[soldier screaming]

214
00:17:05,937 --> 00:17:06,972
Hee hee hee hee!

215
00:17:06,973 --> 00:17:08,875
[soldiers shouting]

216
00:17:11,682 --> 00:17:12,349
Aah!
- Aah!

217
00:17:17,394 --> 00:17:20,164
LU: The Monkey King crushed
every soldier sent to stop him.

218
00:17:20,165 --> 00:17:23,138
With his magical staff,
he was unbeatable.

219
00:17:24,408 --> 00:17:26,144
Word of his disobedience

220
00:17:26,145 --> 00:17:29,550
traveled deep
within the Forbidden Kingdom

221
00:17:29,551 --> 00:17:33,458
to the Five Elements Mountain,
land of the immortals.

222
00:17:33,459 --> 00:17:35,897
Once every 500 years,

223
00:17:35,898 --> 00:17:38,670
The Jade Emperor hosts
the Peach Banquet.

224
00:17:38,671 --> 00:17:41,441
It is here,
the Heavenly Ministers gather

225
00:17:41,442 --> 00:17:44,113
to celebrate
their longevity

226
00:17:44,114 --> 00:17:46,251
and drink
the Elixir of Immortality.

227
00:17:48,324 --> 00:17:52,864
One sip of this heavenly brew
will give everlasting life,

228
00:17:52,865 --> 00:17:55,236
free from mortal suffering
and desire.

229
00:17:57,910 --> 00:17:59,846
[Monkey King laughing]

230
00:17:59,847 --> 00:18:00,915
LU: Into the banquet,

231
00:18:00,916 --> 00:18:04,088
the Monkey King crashed,
uninvited.

232
00:18:04,089 --> 00:18:05,090
MONKEY KING: Whoo!

233
00:18:08,197 --> 00:18:12,104
LU: The Jade Emperor was
enchanted by the Monkey King.

234
00:18:12,105 --> 00:18:15,411
But the Jade Warlord
was not amused.

235
00:18:15,412 --> 00:18:17,114
As Master of the Army,

236
00:18:17,115 --> 00:18:21,022
The Warlord demanded
the Monkey King bow down to him.

237
00:18:21,023 --> 00:18:22,125
[laughing]

238
00:18:24,998 --> 00:18:26,099
[soldiers shouting]

239
00:18:29,908 --> 00:18:32,545
He's a bit unrefined,
that's all.

240
00:18:34,083 --> 00:18:37,321
Give the naughty monkey
a title and let him go.

241
00:18:41,632 --> 00:18:44,770
LU: Satisfied all was well
in heaven and earth,

242
00:18:44,771 --> 00:18:46,407
The Supremely High Emperor

243
00:18:46,408 --> 00:18:49,346
left to begin
his 500 years meditation,

244
00:18:49,347 --> 00:18:54,056
leaving the Jade Warlord
in charge by Mandate of Heaven.

245
00:18:54,057 --> 00:18:56,762
But rather than obey
the Jade Emperor's command,

246
00:18:56,763 --> 00:18:59,333
the Warlord challenged
the Monkey King to a duel.

247
00:19:01,271 --> 00:19:05,078
High atop Five Elements Mountain
in the Warlord's palace,

248
00:19:05,079 --> 00:19:08,151
[drums beating]
the battle of immortals
was fought

249
00:19:08,152 --> 00:19:11,157
To prove once and for all
whose skills were supreme.

250
00:19:18,106 --> 00:19:20,042
[drums grow louder]

251
00:19:39,283 --> 00:19:40,317
Yah!

252
00:20:03,899 --> 00:20:04,867
[both giggling]

253
00:20:35,630 --> 00:20:36,865
Hmph!

254
00:20:36,866 --> 00:20:37,466
[laughs]

255
00:20:41,008 --> 00:20:45,015
[rumbling]

256
00:20:54,301 --> 00:20:55,035
Huh!

257
00:20:58,377 --> 00:20:59,912
Hwah!

258
00:21:04,956 --> 00:21:06,459
Ohh!

259
00:21:27,603 --> 00:21:29,004
[spears clanging
against staff]

260
00:21:48,846 --> 00:21:50,549
[giggling]

261
00:21:50,550 --> 00:21:54,155
Most excellent stick fighting,
Sun Wukong.

262
00:21:54,156 --> 00:21:57,529
But without your weapon, you're
nothing but a lowly hermit!

263
00:21:57,530 --> 00:21:58,632
Hee!

264
00:21:58,633 --> 00:22:00,969
No more weapons,
no more Chi magic.

265
00:22:02,507 --> 00:22:04,677
Fist against fist.

266
00:22:06,615 --> 00:22:08,652
LU: The Monkey King
was too trusting

267
00:22:08,653 --> 00:22:10,656
and believed
the Warlord's words,

268
00:22:10,657 --> 00:22:12,359
laying down his magic weapon.

269
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:13,128
[clang]

270
00:22:14,464 --> 00:22:15,132
Hwah!

271
00:22:20,009 --> 00:22:21,311
LU:
Realizing he'd been tricked,

272
00:22:21,312 --> 00:22:22,981
the Monkey King
cast the staff

273
00:22:22,982 --> 00:22:24,284
out into the Middle Kingdom.

274
00:22:39,582 --> 00:22:40,183
Hmm...

275
00:22:42,889 --> 00:22:45,159
martial art
is based on deception...

276
00:22:46,897 --> 00:22:48,032
my friend.

277
00:22:52,041 --> 00:22:53,009
[drum reverberates]

278
00:22:54,446 --> 00:22:55,514
LU: Being immortal,

279
00:22:55,515 --> 00:22:57,050
the Monkey King
could not be killed,

280
00:22:57,051 --> 00:22:58,787
only trapped in stone,

281
00:22:58,788 --> 00:23:01,126
where he waits for the seeker
from the prophesy

282
00:23:01,127 --> 00:23:04,933
to return to him his great
weapon and finally free him.

283
00:23:16,425 --> 00:23:17,959
That's what I heard,
anyway.

284
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:19,797
[Chinese lute
playing in background]

285
00:23:19,798 --> 00:23:21,667
Long time ago.

286
00:23:21,668 --> 00:23:23,871
How long
has he been imprisoned?

287
00:23:23,872 --> 00:23:27,412
Five hundred years,
give or take a few decades.

288
00:23:27,413 --> 00:23:29,984
They say
when the Monkey King is free,

289
00:23:29,985 --> 00:23:31,320
the Jade Emperor will return.

290
00:23:33,927 --> 00:23:35,261
How do I get home?

291
00:23:35,262 --> 00:23:39,536
You must return the staff
to Five Elements Mountain.

292
00:23:39,537 --> 00:23:41,140
You must
free the Monkey King.

293
00:23:41,141 --> 00:23:42,744
I can't
free the Monkey King.

294
00:23:42,745 --> 00:23:43,979
I gotta get home.

295
00:23:43,980 --> 00:23:46,485
Innkeeper! More wine.

296
00:23:46,486 --> 00:23:47,820
Jeez, don't you think
you've had one too many?

297
00:23:49,658 --> 00:23:51,895
Wine is my inspiration.

298
00:23:51,896 --> 00:23:54,300
In some parts,
I am known as the poet.

299
00:23:54,301 --> 00:23:55,269
<i>Gambei.</i>

300
00:23:59,512 --> 00:24:01,883
In other parts,
I am known as the beggar.

301

302

304
00:24:25,698 --> 00:24:26,699
What do we do now?

305
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:28,369
How good is your kung-fu?

306
00:24:28,370 --> 00:24:30,240
Ah!

307
00:24:30,241 --> 00:24:31,844
He who speaks does not know.

308
00:24:31,845 --> 00:24:34,048
He who knows
does not speak.

309
00:24:34,049 --> 00:24:35,150
Surely, you are masterful.

310
00:24:41,831 --> 00:24:42,799
Where did you get
that weapon?

311
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:44,369
It's a fake.

312
00:24:44,370 --> 00:24:47,342
You can find
anything these days
on the Silk Road.

313
00:24:47,343 --> 00:24:49,011
Out of way, old fool.

314
00:24:49,012 --> 00:24:49,780
Huh?

315
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:53,354
Hand it over.

00:24:56,161 --> 00:24:58,865

00:29:20,492 --> 00:29:22,428
JASON: You really saved
our lives back there.

372
00:29:22,429 --> 00:29:23,530
I don't know
what we would have done

373
00:29:23,531 --> 00:29:25,133
if you hadn't come along.

374
00:29:25,134 --> 00:29:26,570
She does not think

375
00:29:26,571 --> 00:29:28,540
the drunken immortal
needed his life saved.

376
00:29:30,211 --> 00:29:30,978
You're immortal?

377
00:29:32,415 --> 00:29:34,451
What do you run from,
child?

378
00:29:34,452 --> 00:29:36,689
Bounty hunters
trying to stop her

379
00:29:36,690 --> 00:29:38,960
from reaching
the Five Elements Mountain.

380
00:29:45,473 --> 00:29:47,644
I suggest
you keep riding west

381
00:29:47,645 --> 00:29:49,848
and only stop
to water your horses.

382
00:29:49,849 --> 00:29:51,017
You're not coming?

383
00:29:51,018 --> 00:29:52,853
The journey
to Five Elements Mountain

384
00:29:52,854 --> 00:29:54,757
crosses barrens
and deserts.

385
00:29:54,758 --> 00:29:55,592
Unspeakable dangers.

386
00:29:55,593 --> 00:29:57,596
Worst of all, no wine.

387
00:29:57,597 --> 00:29:58,798
His Elixir.

388
00:29:58,799 --> 00:30:00,736
Every immortal
has one.

389
00:30:00,737 --> 00:30:03,173
I'm very sorry.
Without wine, I would perish.

390
00:30:03,174 --> 00:30:04,977
You must understand this.

391
00:30:04,978 --> 00:30:07,815
No. You must understand this.

392
00:30:07,816 --> 00:30:08,517
This is insane!

393
00:30:10,289 --> 00:30:11,757
You wish to get home?
- Yes.

394
00:30:14,463 --> 00:30:15,263
Then listen well!

395
00:30:15,264 --> 00:30:16,432
If you die here,

396
00:30:16,433 --> 00:30:18,938
you'll be found dead
in the world you left behind.

397
00:30:18,939 --> 00:30:19,973
Do you understand?

398
00:30:22,912 --> 00:30:25,216
My jug is getting low.

399
00:30:25,217 --> 00:30:26,485
I must say goodbye.
Bye-bye.

00:30:36,272 --> 00:30:37,306

401
00:30:37,307 --> 00:30:39,310
Wait!

402
00:30:39,311 --> 00:30:40,412
Let him go.

403
00:30:40,413 --> 00:30:42,984
You are the one
to return the staff, not him.

404
00:30:44,488 --> 00:30:45,489
How good is your kung-fu?

405
00:30:45,490 --> 00:30:47,927
He's got no kung-fu.

406
00:30:47,928 --> 00:30:49,630
None!

407
00:30:49,631 --> 00:30:50,933
JASON: Lu, wait!

408
00:30:50,934 --> 00:30:53,037
Teach me.

409
00:30:53,038 --> 00:30:54,306
Teach me to fight!

00:31:08,834 --> 00:31:09,869
He's terrible.

414
00:31:15,147 --> 00:31:17,685
I've been your weed-whacker
for two days now

415
00:31:17,686 --> 00:31:20,356
while you sit on your horse
like the King of England.

416
00:31:20,357 --> 00:31:21,391
When are you gonna
teach me kung-fu?

417
00:31:21,392 --> 00:31:23,095
You want to learn kung-fu?

418
00:31:23,096 --> 00:31:24,531
Yeah.

419
00:31:28,673 --> 00:31:29,641
I teach you kung-fu.

420
00:31:33,215 --> 00:31:34,683
Aah!
- That's called strike.

421
00:31:34,684 --> 00:31:36,520
Tomorrow,
I'll teach you block.

422
00:31:36,521 --> 00:31:37,255
Let's go.

423
00:31:38,859 --> 00:31:41,162

Swing soft, cut hard.

[Jason groaning]

425
00:32:02,271 --> 00:32:04,007
You think you'll teach me
the no shadow kick?

426
00:32:06,212 --> 00:32:07,947
Oh, and the Buddha Palm
technique?

427
00:32:10,487 --> 00:32:12,957
There's a guy
in <i>Virtual Fighter 2</i>

428
00:32:12,958 --> 00:32:14,126
that does
the Buddha Palm technique.

429
00:32:14,127 --> 00:32:15,596
Thanks, Lu.

430
00:32:15,597 --> 00:32:16,832
And he does the, uh...

431
00:32:18,837 --> 00:32:19,303
the Iron Elbow...

432
00:32:20,874 --> 00:32:22,710
And he does
the One-Fingered Death Touch.

433
00:32:22,711 --> 00:32:24,012
The cup's full.

434
00:32:24,013 --> 00:32:24,947
Stop! It's full.

435
00:32:26,985 --> 00:32:28,888
Exactly.

436
00:32:28,889 --> 00:32:31,393
How can you fill your cup
if already full?

437
00:32:31,394 --> 00:32:33,664
How can you learn kung-fu?

438
00:32:33,665 --> 00:32:36,103
You already know so much.

439
00:32:36,104 --> 00:32:37,605
No Shadow Kick,
Buddha Palm!

440
00:32:38,541 --> 00:32:39,709
Empty your cup.

441
00:32:45,689 --> 00:32:47,457
Hopeless.

442
00:32:47,458 --> 00:32:48,092

Is a bridge
between earth and heaven.

446
00:33:17,651 --> 00:33:18,685
It's beautiful.

447
00:33:26,201 --> 00:33:27,167

00:48:16,421 --> 00:48:18,056
No more silent riddles!

560
00:48:19,192 --> 00:48:20,260
And no more empty cups!

561
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:25,470
[grunts]

562
00:48:25,471 --> 00:48:27,374
First, you show respect
to your teachers!

563
00:48:30,782 --> 00:48:33,653
So, what about the two tigers
on one mountain?

564
00:48:35,658 --> 00:48:37,026
We can kill each other
when it's over.

565
00:48:39,632 --> 00:48:41,568
Aah ha ha!

566
00:48:41,569 --> 00:48:43,272
Ha ha ha ha ha!

567
00:48:43,273 --> 00:48:45,275
Ohh!

568
00:48:45,276 --> 00:48:47,947
[Jason groaning]

569
00:48:47,948 --> 00:48:49,851
LU: Kung-fu.

570
00:48:49,852 --> 00:48:52,857
Hard work over time
to accomplish skill.

571
00:48:52,858 --> 00:48:53,725
[Jason groaning]

572
00:48:56,331 --> 00:48:57,766
Aah! Aah!

573
00:48:57,767 --> 00:49:00,237
LU:
A painter can have kung-fu.

574
00:49:00,238 --> 00:49:02,174
[grunting]
Or the butcher who cuts meat

575
00:49:02,175 --> 00:49:06,716
every day with such skill
his knife never touches bone.

576
00:49:06,717 --> 00:49:08,687
[groaning]

577
00:49:11,460 --> 00:49:14,064
SILENT MONK: Learn the form,
but seek the formless.

578
00:49:15,335 --> 00:49:17,672
Hear the soundless.

579
00:49:17,673 --> 00:49:21,045
Learn it all,
then forget it all.

580
00:49:21,046 --> 00:49:25,053
Learn the way,
then find your own way.

581
00:49:26,222 --> 00:49:28,559
LU:
The musician can have kung-fu,

582
00:49:28,560 --> 00:49:31,598
or the poet who paints
pictures with words

583
00:49:31,599 --> 00:49:34,136
and makes emperors weep.

584
00:49:34,137 --> 00:49:36,842
This, too, is kung-fu.

585
00:49:36,843 --> 00:49:39,046
SILENT MONK:
But do not name it, my friend,

586
00:49:39,047 --> 00:49:41,284
for it is like water.

587
00:49:41,285 --> 00:49:43,688
Nothing is softer than water,

588
00:49:43,689 --> 00:49:46,561
yet it can overcome rock.

589
00:49:46,562 --> 00:49:48,364
It does not fight.

590
00:49:48,365 --> 00:49:50,936
It flows around the opponent.

591
00:49:50,937 --> 00:49:53,340
LU: Formless, nameless,

592
00:49:53,341 --> 00:49:56,313
the true master dwells within.

593
00:49:56,314 --> 00:49:58,384
Only you can free him.

594
00:50:47,345 --> 00:50:49,448
[flies buzzing]

595
00:50:58,567 --> 00:51:00,370
[ropes creaking]

596
00:51:02,141 --> 00:51:04,678
SILENT MONK: Behold the tyranny
of the Warlord.

597
00:51:04,679 --> 00:51:07,785
GOLDEN SPARROW:
He must be stopped.

598
00:51:07,786 --> 00:51:11,224
He must be killed for his crimes
and his head put on a post.

599
00:51:12,628 --> 00:51:16,167
But we must not feel hatred
towards him, or he wins.

600
00:51:19,274 --> 00:51:22,579
If he speaks of compassion
for this devil,

601
00:51:22,580 --> 00:51:25,552
he should go back
to his temple and pray.

602
00:51:25,553 --> 00:51:28,491
Our mission
is not one of peace.

603
00:51:28,492 --> 00:51:31,664
Go back
to your mother and father.

604
00:51:31,665 --> 00:51:32,899
You are but a child.

605
00:51:34,436 --> 00:51:35,137
They are dead.

606
00:51:37,409 --> 00:51:39,345
GOLDEN SPARROW:
And she's not a child.

607
00:51:41,517 --> 00:51:42,751
Not anymore.

608
00:51:45,438 --> 00:51:47,374
Her father...

609
00:51:47,375 --> 00:51:51,082
was a government official
who opposed the Warlord.

610
00:51:52,953 --> 00:51:55,925
And so, to set an example,

611
00:51:55,926 --> 00:51:58,964
the Warlord dispatched
his troops into the night.

612
00:51:58,965 --> 00:52:01,236
[sound of soldiers marching]

613
00:52:04,143 --> 00:52:08,250
Legion upon legion poured out
of the Five Elements Mountain

614
00:52:08,251 --> 00:52:11,691
into the lowlands
of the Middle Kingdom.

615
00:52:11,692 --> 00:52:12,960
[people screaming]

616
00:52:12,961 --> 00:52:16,401
Screams of innocent people
hung in the night air.

617
00:52:19,809 --> 00:52:25,353
When it was over, charred ruins
were all that remained.

618
00:52:25,354 --> 00:52:29,361
That, and a lonely child, hidden
in the well by her mother...

619
00:52:30,764 --> 00:52:32,367
ruthlessly murdered
by an arrow...

620
00:52:35,441 --> 00:52:37,377
from the Warlord's bow.

621
00:52:38,982 --> 00:52:41,620
[crying]

622
00:52:42,923 --> 00:52:45,561
When she reaches
the Warlord's palace...

623
00:52:47,566 --> 00:52:49,803
She will
not offer him forgiveness...

624
00:52:51,374 --> 00:52:53,411
monk.

625
00:52:53,412 --> 00:52:55,080
She will offer him...

626
00:52:55,081 --> 00:52:56,150
this...

627
00:53:02,931 --> 00:53:06,337
a Jade dart
that can kill an immortal.

628
00:53:07,775 --> 00:53:10,145
Long has she practiced.

629
00:53:15,657 --> 00:53:18,395
Vengeance has a way
of rebounding upon oneself.

630
00:53:23,774 --> 00:53:25,042
Huh.

631
00:53:25,043 --> 00:53:26,612
Master of Sensitivity.

632
00:53:38,972 --> 00:53:40,174

635
00:54:10,104 --> 00:54:11,572
Damn.

636
00:54:11,573 --> 00:54:12,407
This desert is hot.

637
00:54:14,746 --> 00:54:15,647
This is not a desert.

638
00:54:17,185 --> 00:54:19,088
That is the desert!

639
00:54:24,266 --> 00:54:26,470
LU: I Hope you know
where you're going!

640
00:54:26,471 --> 00:54:27,038
Crazy monk.

641
00:54:39,931 --> 00:54:41,234
Oh!

642
00:55:35,881 --> 00:55:38,519
[wind howling]

643
00:55:45,167 --> 00:55:47,370
A monk on a mission.

644
00:55:47,371 --> 00:55:48,606
And where does he lead us?

645
00:55:48,607 --> 00:55:50,477
Across a desert to nowhere.

646
00:56:16,765 --> 00:56:18,234
We're not gonna make it,
are we?

647
00:56:23,079 --> 00:56:24,915
And even if we do, we still
have to face the Jade Army.

648
00:56:28,657 --> 00:56:30,493
What if I can't handle it?

649
00:56:36,673 --> 00:56:38,042
What if I freeze?

650
00:56:43,186 --> 00:56:44,722
Don't forget to breathe.

651
00:57:19,060 --> 00:57:22,734
If we don't find water soon,
we will perish.

652
00:57:25,040 --> 00:57:28,412
Perhaps a Taoist immortal
can make rain.

653
00:57:31,152 --> 00:57:34,292
If he truly is
a Taoist immortal.

654
00:58:33,415 --> 00:58:34,549
[gagging]

655
00:58:39,627 --> 00:58:40,629
[speaking quietly
in Chinese]

656
00:59:00,471 --> 00:59:02,774
You are an insult
to the name of Buddha!

657
00:59:02,775 --> 00:59:03,576
Blasphemy!

658
00:59:07,418 --> 00:59:08,085
Look!

659
00:59:10,057 --> 00:59:11,659
I lead you to the mountain!

660
00:59:13,931 --> 00:59:14,632
Out there!

00:59:25,321 --> 00:59:26,056

[Chinese lute playing]

663
01:00:24,812 --> 01:00:25,344
Can you see them...

664
01:00:26,549 --> 01:00:27,550
in the clouds?

665
01:00:28,753 --> 01:00:30,054
A two-headed lion.

666
01:00:31,692 --> 01:00:33,195
Right there.

667
01:00:33,196 --> 01:00:34,130
See?

668
01:00:35,733 --> 01:00:36,668
Yeah, I see.

669
01:00:38,841 --> 01:00:39,875
See that one?

670
01:00:39,876 --> 01:00:41,077
Right there,
coming up behind it?

671
01:00:42,214 --> 01:00:43,181
Like a wave?

672
01:00:44,986 --> 01:00:46,255
Looks like
the Green Monster.

673
01:00:47,391 --> 01:00:49,294
Green Monster?

674
01:00:49,295 --> 01:00:50,330
You mean dragon.

675
01:00:51,934 --> 01:00:53,102
No, I mean Fenway Park.

676
01:00:54,305 --> 01:00:56,208
They call the left field fence
the Green Monster.

677
01:00:58,180 --> 01:00:59,148
It's true.

678
01:01:02,589 --> 01:01:03,892
It does kind of look like
a dragon, though, doesn't it?

679
01:01:09,136 --> 01:01:12,609
Have you family back
in this land you come from?

680
01:01:14,948 --> 01:01:16,150
My mother.

681
01:01:17,086 --> 01:01:18,154
Father?

682
01:01:20,326 --> 01:01:20,893
Never knew him.

683
01:01:23,332 --> 01:01:24,935
Do you ever long for him?

684
01:01:27,207 --> 01:01:28,609
Wonder who he was?

685
01:01:32,618 --> 01:01:34,922
Maybe the only thing
I've ever been good at...

686
01:01:37,127 --> 01:01:38,195
pretending that I don't.

687
01:01:41,637 --> 01:01:43,038
She is sorry.

688
01:01:48,117 --> 01:01:49,753
NI CHANG: How romantic.

689
01:01:52,125 --> 01:01:55,598
NI CHANG: Men will tell you
what you want to hear, Sparrow.

690
01:01:55,599 --> 01:01:59,206
But in the end, they will
leave you with nothing.

691
01:02:03,315 --> 01:02:05,552
You survived
the River of Sand.

692
01:02:05,553 --> 01:02:06,988
Impressive.

693
01:02:06,989 --> 01:02:08,825
And you, boy...

694
01:02:08,826 --> 01:02:10,496
so far from home.

695
01:02:10,497 --> 01:02:14,170
I can ensure
your safe return.

696
01:02:14,171 --> 01:02:16,174
Just bring
the weapon forward.

697
01:02:16,175 --> 01:02:17,009
I don't think so.

698
01:02:18,513 --> 01:02:19,447
Why do you
want the staff?

699
01:02:21,185 --> 01:02:23,489
When I deliver
the lost weapon,

700
01:02:23,490 --> 01:02:27,397
the Jade Warlord shall grant me
the Elixir of Immortality.

701
01:02:29,971 --> 01:02:32,809
An orphan girl,
a lost traveler,

702
01:02:32,810 --> 01:02:36,082
an old drunk,
and a monk who has failed

703
01:02:36,083 --> 01:02:38,052
at the same task
for half his life.

704
01:02:38,053 --> 01:02:40,258
[scoffs]

705
01:02:40,259 --> 01:02:44,933
Misfits following a misfit
in hopes of rescuing...a misfit.

01:02:50,545 --> 01:02:51,346
Oh!

Aah!

709
01:03:06,312 --> 01:03:07,179
Kill them.

711
01:03:18,838 --> 01:03:19,572
Aah!

720
01:05:07,161 --> 01:05:09,899
Lu! You okay?

721
01:05:09,900 --> 01:05:10,901
Just thirsty.

722
01:05:15,645 --> 01:05:16,714
Lu!

723
01:05:24,464 --> 01:05:26,200
[grunting]

724
01:05:34,317 --> 01:05:36,154
It's okay.
He's immortal, right?

725
01:05:36,155 --> 01:05:37,357
I mean, he is, right?

726
01:05:37,358 --> 01:05:39,628
Wine.
He needs his wine!

727
01:05:39,629 --> 01:05:40,663
There is nothing we can do.

728
01:05:40,664 --> 01:05:41,866
What are you saying?

729
01:05:41,867 --> 01:05:42,700
We have to do something!

ABBOT: I'm afraid the wound
is too deep.

733
01:06:20,380 --> 01:06:21,948
He will not survive it.

01:06:23,586 --> 01:06:24,521
JASON: He needs wine.

735
01:06:25,892 --> 01:06:28,362
He's one of
the eight immortals.

736
01:06:28,363 --> 01:06:29,497
Wine is his Elixir.
Please.

737
01:06:32,304 --> 01:06:34,007
ABBOT:
We will send a walking monk.

738

LU: Don't you have
a running monk?

739
01:06:59,628 --> 01:07:00,662
When I was your age...

740
01:07:01,866 --> 01:07:04,169
I was a scholar-warrior
in training.

741
01:07:05,940 --> 01:07:08,345
My arrow was good.
So, too, my kung-fu.

742
01:07:09,681 --> 01:07:14,825
So I was chosen to take
the civil examinations.

743
01:07:16,295 --> 01:07:18,265
To pass would place me...

744
01:07:19,769 --> 01:07:23,242
in the very short line
of scholar immortals.

745
01:07:27,018 --> 01:07:27,752
I failed.

746
01:07:30,424 --> 01:07:31,225
You're not an immortal?

747
01:07:34,366 --> 01:07:37,905
If one
does not attach himself

748
01:07:37,906 --> 01:07:39,809
to people and desires...

749
01:07:42,349 --> 01:07:44,653
never shall
his heart be broken.

750
01:07:47,092 --> 01:07:47,993
But then...

751
01:07:50,065 --> 01:07:51,500
does he ever truly live?

752
01:07:55,476 --> 01:07:56,644
I would rather die
a mortal...

753
01:07:59,451 --> 01:08:00,620
who has cared
about someone...

754
01:08:02,958 --> 01:08:05,429
than a man free

755
01:08:05,430 --> 01:08:06,498
from his own death.

756
01:08:09,071 --> 01:08:10,473
I don't want to lose you.

757
01:08:13,748 --> 01:08:15,383
Forget about me.

758
01:08:18,924 --> 01:08:22,164
ABBOT: There is only one
Elixir of Immortality.

759
01:08:22,165 --> 01:08:25,370
It is
the Emperor's mix of Jade,

760
01:08:25,371 --> 01:08:28,577
Cinnabar,
and Salts of Mercury.

761
01:08:28,578 --> 01:08:32,184
It is forever stored in
the realm of the Jade Palace...

762
01:08:33,555 --> 01:08:38,064
high in the Jade firmament,
rarely touched by mortals.

763
01:08:38,065 --> 01:08:41,738
To reach it, one
must take the north road

764
01:08:41,739 --> 01:08:42,740
and cross the border

765
01:08:42,741 --> 01:08:44,042
of heaven and earth...

766
01:08:45,112 --> 01:08:47,817
only to face
the Jade Army.

767
01:08:50,123 --> 01:08:51,124
I'm sorry.

768
01:08:52,260 --> 01:08:53,997
There is no other way.

769
01:08:55,066 --> 01:08:56,702
Yes, there is.

770
01:08:58,306 --> 01:09:01,379
In two nights,
there should be no moon.

771
01:09:01,380 --> 01:09:04,284
We can take the south side
of the fourth peak

772
01:09:04,285 --> 01:09:05,420
under cover of darkness.

773
01:09:06,958 --> 01:09:08,326
We have to go now.
No!

774
01:09:09,496 --> 01:09:10,497
But he's going to die!

775
01:09:12,335 --> 01:09:13,871
We go now, we all die.

776
01:09:18,682 --> 01:09:21,553
There is more at stake,
an entire kingdom.

777
01:09:25,897 --> 01:09:27,398
Your passage home.

778
01:09:30,072 --> 01:09:34,180
We will advance in two nights,
when the moon has ceased.

779
01:09:34,181 --> 01:09:35,549
So be it!

780
01:09:44,167 --> 01:09:46,939
[thunder rumbling
in the distance]

781
01:10:23,115 --> 01:10:23,715
When she met you...

782
01:10:24,785 --> 01:10:27,824
long ago in a tea house...

783
01:10:29,361 --> 01:10:31,097
you were a lost boy
and frightened.

784
01:10:35,006 --> 01:10:36,675
Not the kind
she would stand and fight with.

785
01:12:32,782 --> 01:12:34,820
You've made
a most excellent judgment.

786
01:12:52,824 --> 01:12:54,827
The seeker from the prophecy.

787
01:12:56,365 --> 01:12:58,602
Not quite what I expected.

788
01:12:58,603 --> 01:13:02,176
JASON: A man is dying
back on Song Mountain.

789
01:13:02,177 --> 01:13:03,746
I need the Elixir.

790
01:13:05,283 --> 01:13:07,955
And why should
I give it to you?

791
01:13:07,956 --> 01:13:10,460
Because I brought you
the staff.

792
01:13:10,461 --> 01:13:12,063
The life of your friend

793
01:13:12,064 --> 01:13:13,833
for the power
to rule a kingdom?

794
01:13:15,004 --> 01:13:16,739
A most reasonable offer.

795
01:13:17,843 --> 01:13:20,881
This man, a good friend?

796
01:13:22,185 --> 01:13:23,988
And a good teacher.

797
01:13:23,989 --> 01:13:27,060
The man who honors
his teacher honors himself.

798
01:13:28,531 --> 01:13:32,105
However, there is
a bit of a problem

799
01:13:32,106 --> 01:13:34,075
with your request.

800
01:13:34,076 --> 01:13:35,879
You see...

801
01:13:35,880 --> 01:13:39,320
I've promised the Elixir
to someone else.

802
01:13:39,321 --> 01:13:41,291
But she didn't
bring you the staff.

803
01:13:41,292 --> 01:13:42,860
I did.

804
01:13:42,861 --> 01:13:44,730
The boy has a point.

805
01:13:48,372 --> 01:13:51,144
My liege,
you made a promise.

806
01:13:51,145 --> 01:13:55,953
There is but one way
to resolve such matters.

807
01:13:55,954 --> 01:13:58,592
A martial challenge...
to the death.

808
01:14:01,433 --> 01:14:02,567
With pleasure.

809
01:14:19,604 --> 01:14:21,540
The Elixir of Immortality.

810
01:14:26,151 --> 01:14:29,323
The prize goes to the winner.

811
01:15:03,562 --> 01:15:04,161
Yah!

812
01:15:14,918 --> 01:15:15,418
[groaning]

813
01:15:23,336 --> 01:15:24,237
[groaning]

814
01:15:38,434 --> 01:15:39,168
Aah!

815
01:15:48,387 --> 01:15:49,422
No!

816
01:15:55,302 --> 01:15:56,870
[grunting]

817
01:16:22,858 --> 01:16:23,692
Ahh!

818
01:16:31,544 --> 01:16:32,177
[groaning]

819
01:16:36,186 --> 01:16:37,755

[grunting]

822
01:16:55,559 --> 01:16:56,060
Enough!

823
01:17:12,729 --> 01:17:14,665
JADE WARLORD: The seeker
from the prophecy.

824
01:17:14,666 --> 01:17:16,836
I find that quite amusing.

825
01:17:18,374 --> 01:17:20,210
Did you really think,
even for a minute,

826
01:17:20,211 --> 01:17:21,746
you stood a chance?

827
01:17:25,354 --> 01:17:27,024
I didn't think so.

828
01:17:39,417 --> 01:17:41,955
[shouting in the distance]

829
01:17:46,832 --> 01:17:48,935
[grunting]

830
01:17:57,577 --> 01:17:58,611
Aah!
- Aah!

831
01:17:58,612 --> 01:18:00,716
[shouting]

832
01:18:25,438 --> 01:18:27,543
She will kill you, witch!

833
01:18:27,544 --> 01:18:30,248
Not if I kill you first,
orphan bitch!

834
01:18:36,597 --> 01:18:38,032
[soldiers shouting]

835
01:18:38,033 --> 01:18:39,101
Yah!

836

[groaning]

837
01:20:03,591 --> 01:20:04,825
Aah!

838

[soldiers shouting]

839
01:20:14,481 --> 01:20:16,051
[shouting resumes]

840
01:20:16,052 --> 01:20:19,258
Aaah!

841
01:20:33,858 --> 01:20:34,325
JASON: Yaah!

842

844
01:21:09,604 --> 01:21:10,472
Yah!

845
01:21:21,832 --> 01:21:22,666
<i>Gambei!</i>

846
01:21:24,805 --> 01:21:26,808
[laughing]

847
01:21:42,678 --> 01:21:43,546
Remember what I taught you!

Aah!

Yaah!

853
01:22:42,044 --> 01:22:42,677
The statue!

[groaning]

855
01:22:47,824 --> 01:22:48,558
Use the staff!

856
01:22:55,674 --> 01:22:56,576
Waah!

857
01:23:01,086 --> 01:23:03,157
Aah!

GOLDEN SPARROW: My lord.

878
01:26:20,230 --> 01:26:21,499
Who are you?

879
01:26:21,500 --> 01:26:24,105
The youngest daughter
of a family you murdered.

880
01:26:25,976 --> 01:26:28,147
Come drink with me.

Aah!

Sparrow!

885
01:26:55,175 --> 01:26:57,179
Sparrow.

886
01:26:57,180 --> 01:26:59,383
Come on.

887
01:26:59,384 --> 01:27:00,953
Come on.
You're going to be okay.

Jade Warlord?

894
01:28:36,033 --> 01:28:36,934
He's dead.

895
01:28:44,117 --> 01:28:45,453
I...

896
01:28:48,695 --> 01:28:50,063
I thank you.

Is there anything you can do?

901
01:29:48,227 --> 01:29:51,935
Her destiny was written
by her own hand.

902
01:29:53,238 --> 01:29:54,741
I am sorry.

903
01:30:29,853 --> 01:30:32,124
Traveler...

904
01:30:32,125 --> 01:30:34,196
you have come far,
through the gate of no gate

905
01:30:34,197 --> 01:30:38,305
to fulfill the prophecy
of the mortals.

906
01:30:38,306 --> 01:30:40,342
What do you desire,
please?

907
01:30:42,615 --> 01:30:43,750
I just want to go home.

908
01:30:43,751 --> 01:30:45,888
Ah.

909
01:30:45,889 --> 01:30:47,124
Very well.

910
01:30:53,139 --> 01:30:56,010
It is said
master and student

911
01:30:56,011 --> 01:30:57,815
Walk the path
side-by-side.

912
01:30:57,816 --> 01:30:59,652
They share
their destiny

913
01:30:59,653 --> 01:31:01,122
until their paths
go separate ways.

914
01:31:08,873 --> 01:31:10,409
I'll never forget you.

915
01:31:10,410 --> 01:31:13,316
I guess that's what being
immortal truly means.

916
01:31:19,030 --> 01:31:20,999
You freed me, traveler.

917
01:31:22,204 --> 01:31:25,042
Now go free yourself.

Aah!

925
01:33:10,878 --> 01:33:12,682
So what's it gonna be?

926
01:33:18,262 --> 01:33:19,197
You gonna shut up?

01:33:28,885 --> 01:33:30,087
I ain't gonna
ask you again!

931
01:33:33,897 --> 01:33:34,731
Oh!

932
01:33:38,240 --> 01:33:39,542
[Jason groaning]

933
01:33:43,384 --> 01:33:45,120
Come on, maggot, get up!
Come on!

934
01:33:45,121 --> 01:33:46,657
Huh?

935
01:33:46,658 --> 01:33:48,462
You want some more?

936
01:33:48,463 --> 01:33:49,998
You want some more?

937
01:33:49,999 --> 01:33:50,968
Huh? Come on.

938
01:34:26,380 --> 01:34:28,216
[groaning]

939
01:34:29,320 --> 01:34:30,923
We don't have to do this.

940
01:34:38,607 --> 01:34:39,608
Huh!

941
01:34:47,427 --> 01:34:49,297
[groaning]

942
01:35:06,436 --> 01:35:08,240
FEMALE PARAMEDIC:
Take it easy, sir.

943
01:35:08,241 --> 01:35:09,108
You're gonna be fine.

944
01:35:09,109 --> 01:35:11,112
JASON: Hop! Hop!

945
01:35:11,113 --> 01:35:12,215
How's he doin'?

946
01:35:12,216 --> 01:35:14,019
It missed his heart.
He'll live.

947
01:35:16,124 --> 01:35:18,429
Of course I'll live.

948
01:35:18,430 --> 01:35:19,932
I'm immortal.

949
01:35:22,305 --> 01:35:25,411
Did you return the staff
to rightful owner?

950
01:35:27,383 --> 01:35:27,883
I did.

951
01:35:29,855 --> 01:35:31,057
You're the man.

952
01:35:36,036 --> 01:35:37,338
Two, three, lift.

953
01:35:46,693 --> 01:35:48,696
[siren]

954
01:36:10,412 --> 01:36:11,581
Is he gonna be all right?

955
01:36:15,323 --> 01:36:15,890
Looks like it.

956
01:36:16,993 --> 01:36:18,529
I saw what happened.

957
01:36:18,530 --> 01:36:19,933
I work across the street.

958
01:36:21,136 --> 01:36:22,638
You were very brave.

959
01:36:25,480 --> 01:36:27,082
See ya.

960
01:36:27,083 --> 01:36:27,851
Yeah.

961
01:36:30,891 --> 01:36:31,758
Absolutely.

962
01:36:47,127 --> 01:36:49,265
LU:
And so the legend is told

963
01:36:49,266 --> 01:36:52,138
that the Monkey King
began his journey west

964
01:36:52,139 --> 01:36:54,142
in search of truth,

965
01:36:54,143 --> 01:36:56,915
while the traveler
returned to his world

966
01:36:56,916 --> 01:37:02,027
to walk the path of the warrior
and find his own truth.

967
01:37:02,028 --> 01:37:03,296
As one tale ends...

968
01:37:04,633 --> 01:37:06,007
So another
begins.
