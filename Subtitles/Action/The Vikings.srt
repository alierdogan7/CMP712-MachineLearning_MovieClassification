<i>(narrator) The Vikings in Europe</i>
<i>of the eighth and ninth century</i>

2
00:00:33,310 --> 00:00:38,065
<i>were dedicated to a pagan</i>
<i>god of war, Odin.</i>

3
00:00:39,830 --> 00:00:43,300
<i>Cramped by the confines</i>
<i>of their barren, icebound northlands,</i>

4
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:45,864
<i>they exploited their skill</i>
<i>as shipbuilders</i>

5
00:00:45,990 --> 00:00:50,984
<i>to spread a reign of terror</i>
<i>then unequalled in violence and brutality</i>

6
00:00:51,110 --> 00:00:53,863
<i>in all the records of history.</i>

7
00:00:54,310 --> 00:00:56,301
<i>The greatest wish of every Viking</i>

8
00:00:56,430 --> 00:01:00,343
<i>was to die sword in hand</i>
<i>and enter Valhalla,</i>

9
00:01:00,470 --> 00:01:04,019
<i>where a hero's welcome</i>
<i>awaited them from the god Odin.</i>

10
00:01:07,430 --> 00:01:09,580
<i>The compass was unknown,</i>

11
00:01:09,710 --> 00:01:13,464
<i>and they could steer only</i>
<i>by the sun and the stars.</i>

12
00:01:16,990 --> 00:01:21,461
<i>Once fog closed in,</i>
<i>they were left helpless and blind.</i>

13
00:01:21,590 --> 00:01:24,024
<i>After all, the earth was flat.</i>

14
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:27,779
<i>Sail too far off course,</i>
<i>and the black wind would blow them</i>

15
00:01:27,910 --> 00:01:30,424
<i>across the poison sea</i>
<i>that lay to the west</i>

16
00:01:30,550 --> 00:01:33,906
<i>and over the edge of the world</i>
<i>into limbo.</i>

17
00:01:36,470 --> 00:01:39,303
<i>Their abiding aim</i>
<i>was to conquer England,</i>

18
00:01:39,430 --> 00:01:44,902
<i>then a series of petty kingdoms,</i>
<i>each one the jealous rival of the next.</i>

19
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:49,185
<i>Thus, when the Vikings set forth</i>
<i>to rob and plunder England,</i>

20
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:52,063
<i>they never sailed out</i>
<i>of sight of land.</i>

21
00:01:52,190 --> 00:01:56,069
<i>They confined their attacks</i>
<i>to swift overnight raids.</i>

22
00:01:56,190 --> 00:02:00,468
<i>It was no accident that the English book</i>
<i>of prayer contained this sentence:</i>

23
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:04,629
<i>"Protect us, oh Lord,</i>
<i>from the wrath of the Northmen."</i>

24
00:02:06,070 --> 00:02:08,948
- <i>(man)</i> Ragnar!
- <i>(yelling outside)</i>

<i>(choir singing)</i>

29
00:03:18,830 --> 00:03:22,869
The king is dead. Long live the king.

30
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:32,588
For two months we have mourned
the good King Edwin,

31
00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:36,146
who by the cruel Viking Ragnar
was foully murdered,

32
00:03:36,270 --> 00:03:39,979
and still lies unrevenged.

33
00:03:40,110 --> 00:03:45,742
The council of the kingdom now declare
that Aella is of the true royal line

34
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:49,306
and welcome his succession
to the throne.

35
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:51,386
<i>(choir continues singing)</i>

36
00:04:05,070 --> 00:04:07,459

37
00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:10,150
Thank you, my gracious lady.

38
00:04:10,270 --> 00:04:13,899
Rest assured that the barbarians
that murdered your husband, my cousin,

39
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:17,579
will soon feel the weight of my anger.

40
00:04:17,710 --> 00:04:20,508
And though your union with Edwin
was fruitless,

41
00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:24,669
feel confident that you retain
the respect of us all.

42
00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:29,742
You may retire... Queen Enid.

43
00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:39,665
<i>(priests)</i> We, Thurston Bishop

You need not fear, my lady.
His words cannot hurt you.

He has no right to the throne.

47

There is no direct heir, my lady.

48
00:04:53,870 --> 00:04:56,065
There is an heir.

49
00:04:57,870 --> 00:04:58,825
What?

50
00:04:58,950 --> 00:05:03,307
Brother Godwin, I am with child.
But not Edwin's.

51
00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:06,945
The child is that of the Viking, Ragnar.

The holy sword Requitur,

There are already rumours of his birth.
If they were to reach Aella...

59
00:06:26,390 --> 00:06:28,142
Where are you sending him?

60
00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:33,139
To Italy, to be tended by monks
who will not know his identity.

61
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:37,024
But his life will be safe, and yours too.

62
00:06:37,150 --> 00:06:39,505
Father Godwin!

63
00:06:43,510 --> 00:06:47,185
- The pommelstone of the sword Requitur.
- <i>(Enid)</i> It is his by right.

64
00:06:47,310 --> 00:06:53,101
If you hope to identify him in years to
come by this stone, so can his enemies.

<i>(narrator) "o years passed.</i>
<i>Queen Enid had died,</i>

66

<i>but the rumour that she had given birth</i>
<i>to a son continued to plague Kink Aella.</i>

67
00:07:02,190 --> 00:07:05,102
<i>Although his castle became</i>
<i>the stronghold of all England,</i>

68
00:07:05,230 --> 00:07:08,381
<i>Aella was unable to stop</i>
<i>the Viking raids.</i>

69
00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:12,580
Now let it be known throughout
the kingdom of Northumbria

70
00:07:12,710 --> 00:07:17,340
that I, King Rhodri of Wales,
bestow on King Aella

71

the hand of my daughter, Morgana.

72
00:07:21,150 --> 00:07:23,505
I will consent to this.

73
00:07:24,350 --> 00:07:28,946
I, too, King Rhodri of Wales, consent.

74
00:07:29,070 --> 00:07:30,742
Praise be to God.

On the first day of spring,
you will become my bride.

I trust, Lord Egbert,
that you approve of this alliance?

With all my heart, sire.

80
00:08:11,670 --> 00:08:15,709
Then why do you spread tales of an heir
to the throne left by Queen Enid?

<i>(crowd murmuring)</i>

82

00:08:23,470 --> 00:08:26,428
with the pommelstone of the
sword Requitur tied about him.

85
00:08:26,550 --> 00:08:30,543
Your Majesty, is it wise to speak
of things so long in the past?

I hope soon to silence
these wagging tongues.

This beautiful child will present me
with an heir to the throne.

88

And this marriage
will combine our strengths

89
00:08:41,350 --> 00:08:44,501

I must also expose
a traitor in our midst.

93

Surely there are no traitors
in this hall, sire.

94

Cousin Egbert... why have your lands
never been attacked by the Vikings?

What do you mean, sire?

96
00:09:03,470 --> 00:09:07,349
Neither your lands nor those of your
conspirators have suffered any harm.

- Conspirators?!
- You have schemed against me.

I'll not be the scapegoat
for your failure to stop the Vikings!

99

You have conspired with the foes
of England to dethrone me!

- What foes?
- The Vikings! Take him out!

- Hunt him down.

00:20:18,190 --> 00:20:21,182
Odin!

171
00:20:21,310 --> 00:20:24,143
<i>(all)</i> Odin!

172
00:20:36,790 --> 00:20:39,258
Bring in the slave.

173
00:20:48,350 --> 00:20:50,944
Look how he glares at me.

174
00:20:51,070 --> 00:20:56,098
If he wasn't fathered by a black ram in
the full of the moon, my name is not Ragnar.

175
00:20:57,790 --> 00:21:00,179
What would you do with him
in your country?

176
00:21:00,310 --> 00:21:03,905
We have a special reward which is
rather entertaining in a noisy way.

177
00:21:04,030 --> 00:21:07,340
- What's that?
- Nothing much, just a pit full of wolves,

178
00:21:07,470 --> 00:21:11,861
half mad with starvation and trained
to appreciate the flavour of human blood.

179
00:21:11,990 --> 00:21:16,302
Ah, you see!
The English <i>are</i> civilised.

180
00:21:16,430 --> 00:21:20,787
- Can you think of anything worse?
- I can think of something far worse.

181
00:21:20,910 --> 00:21:25,267
I guess you can, with your
pretty dainty face spoiled.

182
00:21:25,390 --> 00:21:28,029
But he was a good slave. Kill him quick.

183
00:21:28,150 --> 00:21:33,429
- No. No quick death for him.
- What do you suggest I do with him?

184
00:21:35,670 --> 00:21:38,264
- Nothing.
- Nothing?

185
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:43,058
I want this slave alive.

186
00:21:43,190 --> 00:21:45,499
After tearing your face apart?

187
00:21:45,630 --> 00:21:46,949
Yes.

188
00:21:47,070 --> 00:21:51,825
The sun will cross the sky
a thousand times before he dies.

189
00:21:57,310 --> 00:22:03,067
And you'll wish a thousand times
that you were dead.

190
00:22:12,830 --> 00:22:14,786
<i>(Ragnar)</i> Kitala!

191
00:22:17,390 --> 00:22:19,858
You can't kill the slave.

192
00:22:22,670 --> 00:22:25,025
What do the runes say?

193
00:22:34,230 --> 00:22:40,180
If Odin willed that Eric should die, Thor's
hammer would sound his death knell.

194
00:22:42,670 --> 00:22:44,422
But the sky is silent.

195
00:22:49,430 --> 00:22:53,787
The curse of Odin waits on him
who kills the slave.

196
00:23:08,270 --> 00:23:12,946
Then no <i>man</i> shall kill him.
Let the tide of the sea do it.

197
00:23:13,790 --> 00:23:17,703
Bind him, cast him into the slop-pool
at low tide! Take him out!

198
00:23:18,990 --> 00:23:23,427
You'll throw him into the slop-pool
to be drowned and eaten by crabs?

199
00:23:23,550 --> 00:23:27,145
Then let the crabs be cursed by Odin!
That's my decision.

200
00:23:37,830 --> 00:23:40,025
If he survives the pool, what then?

201
00:23:40,990 --> 00:23:43,265
If he's still alive when the tide turns,

202
00:23:43,390 --> 00:23:46,348
then any fool who fishes him out
can have him!

203
00:23:46,470 --> 00:23:48,426
Survives!

204
00:24:17,870 --> 00:24:21,385
Odin! Odin!

205
00:24:21,510 --> 00:24:24,502
Send a wind and turn the tide.

206
00:24:25,270 --> 00:24:29,229
Odin! Odin!

207
00:24:29,870 --> 00:24:32,304
Odin!

208
00:24:47,350 --> 00:24:49,739
Put her on the testing board.

209
00:25:01,230 --> 00:25:03,949
I think I'll go and watch
that slave drowning.

210
00:25:04,070 --> 00:25:07,824
Stay here!
You'll see something more interesting.

211
00:25:15,270 --> 00:25:17,784
It does look rather an interesting game.

212
00:25:17,910 --> 00:25:22,028
It's not a game.
It's Odin's test for unfaithful wives.

213
00:25:27,030 --> 00:25:29,305
Is she an unfaithful wife?

214
00:25:30,670 --> 00:25:34,345
- Ask Einar.
- Her husband says she is.

215
00:25:34,470 --> 00:25:37,268
- Which is he?
- He's throwing the axes.

216
00:25:47,190 --> 00:25:50,421
But, uh... if she's innocent?

217
00:25:50,550 --> 00:25:53,906
Her husband will succeed,
the braids will be cut.

218
00:25:57,750 --> 00:26:02,870
Supposing he misses
the braids and hits her?

219
00:26:02,990 --> 00:26:06,539
- Well, then she's guilty.
- I see.

220
00:26:13,070 --> 00:26:17,541
But what happens if he misses
both the girl and the braids?

221
00:26:17,670 --> 00:26:20,468
Three misses and we drown <i>himl</i>

222
00:26:47,550 --> 00:26:49,506
One!

223
00:26:56,310 --> 00:27:01,464
You're too drunk!
You'll split her wide open!

224
00:27:02,190 --> 00:27:04,750
Drunk, am I? I haven't had enough!

225
00:27:50,070 --> 00:27:52,026
<i>(cheering)</i>

226
00:27:56,150 --> 00:27:58,380
You missed her, didn't you?

227
00:28:04,110 --> 00:28:06,305
What a son!

228
00:28:25,110 --> 00:28:26,941
Kitala.

229
00:28:27,070 --> 00:28:29,982
Kitala, my legs, my legs...

230
00:28:30,110 --> 00:28:33,659
Move your legs, Eric.
You must move them.

231
00:28:48,030 --> 00:28:52,342
- Where did this slave boy come from?
- Bjorn brought him here from a raid.

232
00:28:52,470 --> 00:28:55,746
He was taken from a ship on the sea.

233
00:28:55,870 --> 00:28:58,509
- And this was found about his neck?
- Yes.

234
00:28:58,630 --> 00:29:02,669
It's the only possession he ever had.
He has no need of it now.

235
00:29:02,790 --> 00:29:04,621
<i>(Eric splutters)</i>

236
00:29:11,630 --> 00:29:13,825
He's going to die.

237
00:29:13,950 --> 00:29:19,388
Listen to me, little slave. Einar is
in the hall celebrating your death!

238
00:29:19,510 --> 00:29:22,104
Einar is laughing at you!

239
00:29:22,230 --> 00:29:24,698
Einar... Einar.

240
00:29:25,110 --> 00:29:30,059
- Live, Eric. Fight the cold.
- Live and fight Einar.

241
00:29:31,590 --> 00:29:35,708
Fight Einar. Fight Einar.

242
00:29:37,190 --> 00:29:41,627
Odin. Odin.

243
00:29:41,750 --> 00:29:43,627
Odin!

244
00:29:54,430 --> 00:29:57,820
- Odin has answered you.
- They were only flying clouds.

245
00:29:57,950 --> 00:30:02,341
You're blind.
They were Odin's daughters.

246
00:30:02,470 --> 00:30:07,066
I heard the singing of their battle
swords as they rode across the sky.

247
00:30:07,190 --> 00:30:09,306
They bring the wind.

248
00:30:09,830 --> 00:30:11,786
They bring the wind!

249
00:30:13,990 --> 00:30:15,105
Listen to it.

250
00:30:16,790 --> 00:30:18,746
<i>(wind whistling)</i>

251
00:31:07,270 --> 00:31:10,148
<i>(laughter)</i>

252
00:31:25,390 --> 00:31:30,384
The north wind, it's turning back
the tide. Cut him loose.

253
00:31:34,590 --> 00:31:38,139
The tide is going out. Your job is done.

254
00:32:13,430 --> 00:32:15,864
<i>(Einar)</i> I'll take the slave.

255
00:32:19,630 --> 00:32:23,828
He's mine, Einar! The wind
turned the tide and I pulled him out.

256
00:32:23,950 --> 00:32:26,510
I'll take him, Englishman.

257
00:32:26,630 --> 00:32:29,781
If your father's word
means anything, he's mine.

258
00:32:29,910 --> 00:32:33,425
Why such a sudden interest
in a slave, my lord?

259
00:32:33,550 --> 00:32:36,667
Shall we say, an English passion
for converting the wicked

260
00:32:36,790 --> 00:32:40,180
to the paths of righteousness.

261
00:32:41,950 --> 00:32:44,862
Well, you're not in England now.

262
00:32:46,030 --> 00:32:50,148
And you never will be unless
I draw maps of England for your father.

263
00:32:56,910 --> 00:32:58,980
All right.

264
00:32:59,110 --> 00:33:03,501
You can keep the slave...
for as long as you live.

265
00:33:11,150 --> 00:33:16,702
- Odin's thanks for saving him.
- And at no little risk to myself.

266
00:33:19,830 --> 00:33:22,549
Do you know what this is?

267
00:33:25,070 --> 00:33:27,584
Some day, I'll tell you what it is.

268
00:33:27,710 --> 00:33:31,259
And you'll remember then
that I saved you.

269
00:33:56,430 --> 00:33:58,148
I'm still a slave.

270
00:33:58,270 --> 00:34:02,104
- You won't be when we get to England.
- I'll never get to England.

271
00:34:02,230 --> 00:34:05,700
You're like a wounded animal.
You trust no one.

272
00:34:05,830 --> 00:34:07,900
- Good day, my lords.
- Hail, Egbert!

273
00:34:08,030 --> 00:34:11,386
- How's the boat coming along?
- She'll be ready in a week.

274
00:34:11,510 --> 00:34:14,308
Well, she's no sea dragon,
but she'll do for a toy.

275
00:34:14,430 --> 00:34:16,739
Does Einar still bear me a grudge?

276
00:34:16,870 --> 00:34:19,907
You were a fool to anger my son.
He'll kill you one day.

277
00:34:20,030 --> 00:34:23,067
You're not still angry, are you, Einar?

278
00:34:23,190 --> 00:34:25,750
- That depends.
- On what?

279
00:34:28,630 --> 00:34:30,586
On how well you draw maps.

280
00:34:31,950 --> 00:34:35,465
See for yourself.
This is a map of Wales.

281
00:34:35,590 --> 00:34:39,708
Wales? That slag heap?
That's not worth one night's raiding.

282
00:34:39,830 --> 00:34:43,425
It holds the richest prize of all:
King Rhodri's daughter, Morgana.

283
00:34:43,550 --> 00:34:47,020
Ha! Rhodri couldn't raise enough
to ransom a Skagerrak moose.

284
00:34:47,150 --> 00:34:51,223
No, but Aella could.
He's to marry her in the spring.

285
00:34:51,350 --> 00:34:52,624
Oh?

286
00:34:53,310 --> 00:34:56,541
Einar, I think our Englishman
has a good idea.

287
00:34:56,990 --> 00:34:59,265
She's leaving soon
and must go round this point.

288
00:34:59,390 --> 00:35:01,824
- Here? You're sure?
- I'd stake my life on it.

289
00:35:01,950 --> 00:35:04,418
You already have.

290
00:35:04,550 --> 00:35:07,940
Let me intercept her
and bring her back here.

291
00:35:08,070 --> 00:35:10,425
- How many men would you need?
- One boat.

292
00:35:10,550 --> 00:35:12,302
- Only one boat?
- No more.

293
00:35:12,430 --> 00:35:16,503
What about him without the collar?
Would you take him along?

294
00:35:17,310 --> 00:35:20,382
Well, naturally I'd take along my slave.

295
00:35:20,510 --> 00:35:24,583
You stay here and draw maps.
I'll kidnap the girl.

296
00:35:29,550 --> 00:35:35,147
Get him to draw maps that'll guide a ship
through fog - then he'll be worth keeping.

297
00:35:35,270 --> 00:35:39,104
- There is no map of any use in fog.
- Then what use are you to us?

298
00:35:39,230 --> 00:35:43,746
Think of that while I'm gone. And don't
let anything happen to that slave.

299
00:35:53,230 --> 00:35:56,984
<i>(Kitala)</i> It's a strange metal
that fell to earth from the North Star.

300
00:35:57,110 --> 00:35:59,670
Sandpiper brought it from far away.

301
00:35:59,790 --> 00:36:03,465
The price he paid
was his ears and his tongue.

302
00:36:03,830 --> 00:36:06,947
No matter how you hold it,
it struggles to return homeward

303
00:36:07,070 --> 00:36:11,905
to the star from which it fell.
It always points to the north.

304
00:36:12,030 --> 00:36:16,467
Not in the fog.
You cannot see the stars in the fog.

305
00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:19,506
Watch.

306
00:36:26,870 --> 00:36:30,146
Can it see the star through these walls?

307
00:36:41,510 --> 00:36:43,944
This could lead you to many places.

308
00:36:44,070 --> 00:36:48,985
Even to the land beyond
the poison sea, Valhalla.

309
00:36:49,110 --> 00:36:51,101
You will go there one day.

310
00:36:51,230 --> 00:36:54,108
Only great heroes have ever reached it.

311
00:36:57,830 --> 00:36:59,980
See what the runes say.

312
00:37:03,710 --> 00:37:05,940
Will this take me there?

313
00:37:10,830 --> 00:37:12,786
No.

314
00:37:14,070 --> 00:37:16,903
A woman will point the way.

315
00:37:21,550 --> 00:37:24,860
- What will she look like?
- You will know her when you see her.

316
00:37:24,990 --> 00:37:28,107
- When will that be?
- Soon enough.

317
00:37:28,990 --> 00:37:31,823
Will she love me or hate me?

318
00:37:31,950 --> 00:37:36,307
Love and hate are horns
on the same goat.

319
00:37:37,270 --> 00:37:39,830
What woman would ever look at a slave?

320
00:37:39,950 --> 00:37:42,225
This one will.

321
00:37:48,030 --> 00:37:50,146
You're lying, Kitala.

322
00:37:53,110 --> 00:37:55,704
All your tales are lies.

323
00:38:23,590 --> 00:38:26,980
Don't look so sad, my lady.
It doesn't become you.

324
00:38:27,110 --> 00:38:29,829
Bridget, how can I marry a man
that I hate?

325
00:38:29,950 --> 00:38:33,181
It's not easy to be a princess,
but you have a duty.

326
00:38:33,310 --> 00:38:37,508
This alliance will help your people.
You must marry Aella.

327
00:38:37,630 --> 00:38:39,507
I would rather that I were dead.

328
00:38:39,630 --> 00:38:42,667
The Vikings! Turn back! It's the Vikings!

329
00:38:50,150 --> 00:38:51,583
Quick, my ladies, inside.

330
00:38:51,710 --> 00:38:55,020
Steersmen, cut to the wind!
Forecastle men forward!

331
00:39:03,310 --> 00:39:08,179
Remember, she's not to be harmed
or she's worthless in trade!

332
00:39:11,470 --> 00:39:14,303
All pull at the bowline!

333
00:39:22,830 --> 00:39:24,980
Bend your backs!

334
00:41:10,830 --> 00:41:13,185
Oh! No! No!

335
00:41:13,950 --> 00:41:15,986
Bridget!

336
00:41:16,110 --> 00:41:18,670
- My lady!
- No!

337
00:41:18,790 --> 00:41:21,509
- No! No!
- My lady... help!

338
00:41:22,190 --> 00:41:24,579
My lady... <i>(screams)</i>

339
00:41:26,470 --> 00:41:28,381
Bridget! Bridget!

340
00:41:29,550 --> 00:41:31,506
<i>(screaming)</i>

341
00:41:33,030 --> 00:41:35,100
My lady!

342
00:41:36,670 --> 00:41:39,468
- Bridget!
- <i>(screams)</i>

343
00:41:39,590 --> 00:41:41,546
Bridget!

344
00:41:42,630 --> 00:41:44,905
Welcome aboard, my lady.

345
00:41:45,030 --> 00:41:46,782
Aella will kill you for this.

346
00:41:46,910 --> 00:41:50,027
Aella? It would be a pity
to send you back to <i>him</i>.

347
00:41:50,150 --> 00:41:52,459
What do you know of Aella?

348
00:41:53,670 --> 00:41:57,299
Well, I know he'll pay all the treasure
he's got to get you back.

349
00:41:58,110 --> 00:42:00,670
I'll keep you for myself.

350
00:42:01,230 --> 00:42:03,903
By Odin, she'd make a fine Viking queen.

351
00:42:04,030 --> 00:42:05,019
<i>(laughter)</i>

352
00:42:05,150 --> 00:42:06,947
Get away from me!

353
00:42:07,070 --> 00:42:10,107
Hey, now first a little kiss of welcome.

354
00:42:10,230 --> 00:42:12,664
Get away!

355
00:42:13,230 --> 00:42:15,744
- A little kiss of welcome.
- No!

356
00:42:15,870 --> 00:42:17,588
Yes.

357
00:42:17,710 --> 00:42:18,779
<i>(laughter)</i>

358
00:42:18,910 --> 00:42:23,506
Remember, she's not to be harmed
or she'll be worthless in trade.

359
00:42:23,870 --> 00:42:27,704
Pretty bird, pretty feathers.
Build her a nest so she can hide.

360
00:42:29,070 --> 00:42:31,630
Too many hawks around here!

361
00:42:33,150 --> 00:42:35,948
- Make sail!
- Make sail.

362
00:43:04,830 --> 00:43:06,786
Einar!

363
00:43:16,190 --> 00:43:19,307
<i>(horn continues)</i>

364
00:43:33,070 --> 00:43:35,026
<i>(bells clanking)</i>

365
00:45:07,630 --> 00:45:09,268
Hail, Einar!

366
00:45:09,390 --> 00:45:14,783
<i>(crowd)</i>
Hail, Einar! Hail, Einar! Hail, Einar!

367
00:45:14,910 --> 00:45:16,866
<i>(cheering)</i>

368
00:45:27,750 --> 00:45:29,786
Stop rowing.

369
00:45:39,590 --> 00:45:42,104
Oars down!

370
00:45:43,350 --> 00:45:45,944
- Hail, Einar.
- Hail, Ragnar.

371
00:45:46,070 --> 00:45:48,743
I give thanks to Odin
for your safe return.

372
00:45:48,870 --> 00:45:51,668
- Well, where is she?
- Where's who?

373
00:45:51,790 --> 00:45:54,224
Who do you think?
Your friend with the pigtails?!

374
00:45:54,350 --> 00:45:58,309
Oh, stop shouting. You sound like
a moose giving birth to a hedgehog.

375
00:45:58,430 --> 00:46:01,024
- Einar!
- Get this grain ashore.

376
00:46:01,150 --> 00:46:03,869
I wanna know why you missed
the wench you were sent for.

377
00:46:03,990 --> 00:46:07,187
- I didn't miss her.
- Where is she?

378
00:46:14,790 --> 00:46:16,746
Ah...

379
00:46:16,870 --> 00:46:20,704
A little skinny, perhaps,
but not bad. Not bad at all.

380
00:46:20,830 --> 00:46:22,661
Restrain yourself, my lord.

381
00:46:22,790 --> 00:46:27,227
If she is dishonoured, she'll be worthless
as a queen and Aella won't ransom her.

382
00:46:27,350 --> 00:46:31,821
- I don't need traitors to plead my cause.
- My quarrel is with Aella, lady, not you.

383
00:46:31,950 --> 00:46:34,418
We agreed you would be unharmed.

384
00:46:34,550 --> 00:46:38,225
- Remember that, Einar. Leave her alone.
- I haven't touched her... yet.

385
00:46:38,350 --> 00:46:40,910
And you never will.
I'd kill myself first.

386
00:46:41,470 --> 00:46:45,941
- Ah. She doesn't seem to like you.
- She likes me well enough.

387
00:46:46,070 --> 00:46:48,379
I doubt it, from the looks of her.

388
00:46:48,510 --> 00:46:50,580
So do I.

389
00:46:51,830 --> 00:46:55,505
- But the time will come.
- Never.

390
00:46:55,630 --> 00:46:57,586
Never?

391
00:46:58,710 --> 00:47:03,022
You like the scars on my face,
don't you, hm?

392
00:47:03,150 --> 00:47:07,666
Sure, my beauty stirs her little heart.

393
00:47:17,070 --> 00:47:22,463
You have better luck with falcons. She'll
never call <i>you</i> dainty-face! <i>(laughs)</i>

394
00:47:31,990 --> 00:47:33,787
Any objections?

395
00:47:33,910 --> 00:47:36,344
Of course not, my lord.
He's just a slave.

396
00:47:36,470 --> 00:47:39,780
- Let's go ashore and take her along.
- She stays here.

397
00:47:42,790 --> 00:47:47,181
We'll talk about her again,
when you're more drunk or more sober.

398
00:47:47,310 --> 00:47:52,907
Olaf! Anchor the boat out on the fjord.
And guard her well.

399
00:48:03,390 --> 00:48:04,345
<i>(cheering)</i>

400
00:48:21,150 --> 00:48:25,507
Ah, come. You'll soon forget the wench.

401
00:48:25,630 --> 00:48:29,100
- She's too skinny anyhow.
- She's beautiful.

402
00:48:29,230 --> 00:48:35,703
Ah, all those bones sticking out, she's an
old crow with all the feathers pulled out.

403
00:48:35,830 --> 00:48:38,469
She said she'd kill herself
if I touched her.

404
00:48:38,590 --> 00:48:43,539
They all say that. What they really mean
is they'll kill themselves if you <i>don't</i>.

405
00:48:43,670 --> 00:48:47,948
Maybe, but I've never had one
spit on me and bite me.

406
00:48:48,070 --> 00:48:52,985
Huh! They'll bite all the more
now that you're Einar One-Eye.

407
00:48:53,110 --> 00:48:56,989
I wanted to thank you
for proving me innocent.

408
00:49:02,110 --> 00:49:04,340
Go back to your husband.

409
00:49:05,870 --> 00:49:10,625
Come. Drink.
No one woman is worth all this fuss.

410
00:49:34,350 --> 00:49:37,820
Well, my lady,
as terrible as this captivity is,

411
00:49:37,950 --> 00:49:42,341
at least we should be thankful
that so far our honour has been spared.

412
00:49:42,470 --> 00:49:45,303
Yes, Bridget,
we have that to be thankful for.

413
00:49:45,430 --> 00:49:49,389
Strange how things never
turn out the way you expect.

414
00:49:49,510 --> 00:49:53,219
I always thought Vikings
attacked their women.

415
00:49:53,350 --> 00:49:55,102
We've been very lucky.

416
00:49:55,230 --> 00:49:57,903
It hasn't been due
entirely to luck, Bridget.

417
00:49:58,030 --> 00:50:01,784
He can't help the way he acts.
He's a pagan, my lady.

418
00:50:01,910 --> 00:50:05,186
- He's a mad dog.
- Well...

419
00:50:05,310 --> 00:50:09,383
If it weren't for the scars on his face,
he'd be rather nice looking.

420
00:50:09,510 --> 00:50:11,978
Oh, for a Viking, I mean.

421
00:50:12,110 --> 00:50:14,624
I don't want to talk about him.

422
00:50:16,430 --> 00:50:20,105
Scratches and bites
won't hold him off for ever.

423
00:50:35,790 --> 00:50:37,781
What a son!

424
00:50:41,550 --> 00:50:44,348
How about my mother?

425
00:50:44,470 --> 00:50:47,064
Tell me, did my mother fight you?

426
00:50:49,470 --> 00:50:52,542
Ah, did she fight me.

427
00:50:52,670 --> 00:50:57,221
I have the scars of her scratches
and bites all over me.

428
00:50:57,350 --> 00:51:00,183
Ha! What a woman.

429
00:51:02,750 --> 00:51:05,344
That's how I feel about Morgana.

430
00:51:07,110 --> 00:51:08,862
Look at me.

431
00:51:08,990 --> 00:51:13,142
Do you think with this face I want
the kind of wife who'd <i>let</i> me touch her?

432
00:51:13,270 --> 00:51:19,823
I want her to fight me tooth and nail,
the first time I take her and the last.

433
00:51:23,390 --> 00:51:25,506
You are my son.

434
00:51:26,510 --> 00:51:31,220
And you'll be wearing this one day.
Don't forget that.

435
00:51:31,350 --> 00:51:33,466
I won't forget it.

436
00:51:39,950 --> 00:51:46,788
Now... if you really want her,
as skinny as she is, I give her to you.

437
00:51:46,910 --> 00:51:49,822
Wait a minute. What do you mean, you...

438
00:51:50,550 --> 00:51:55,749
- You mean we won't ransom her?
- No! You can have her.

439
00:51:59,150 --> 00:52:04,463
Oh, I'll give this little wench from
Wales a reason to bite and scratch.

440
00:52:09,030 --> 00:52:12,102
I'm Einar!

441
00:52:12,230 --> 00:52:14,346
Son of Ragnar!

442
00:52:14,470 --> 00:52:19,988
I'll show her what forging can be done
when fire fights fire!

443
00:52:20,110 --> 00:52:24,501
I'll make her howl
till they hear her in Wales!

444
00:52:29,310 --> 00:52:31,107
<i>(crowd singing)</i>

445
00:52:49,390 --> 00:52:51,699
Morgana!

446
00:52:52,710 --> 00:52:56,703
My pretty little bird,
sharpen your claws!

447
00:52:56,830 --> 00:52:58,786
<i>(laughs)</i>

448
00:52:59,630 --> 00:53:01,939
I'm Einar!

449
00:53:05,630 --> 00:53:09,703
All right, men! Everybody off!

450
00:53:09,830 --> 00:53:13,027
Morgana and I wanna be alone.

451
00:53:13,150 --> 00:53:15,505
Good job, mate!

452
00:53:17,310 --> 00:53:19,949
Agh... Olaf!

453
00:53:21,190 --> 00:53:23,624
Thank you, Olaf!

454
00:53:23,750 --> 00:53:27,379
Morgana! Out! Out!

455
00:53:27,510 --> 00:53:31,264
- We don't need you.
- I can't swim!

456
00:53:38,870 --> 00:53:41,543
If you touch me, I'll kill myself.

457
00:53:43,310 --> 00:53:46,302
There's a sword to do it with...

458
00:53:46,430 --> 00:53:48,500
because I'm going to touch you.

459
00:53:53,550 --> 00:53:55,541
Scratch.

460
00:53:58,430 --> 00:54:00,739
Come on.

461
00:54:00,870 --> 00:54:03,668
- Fight!
- A woman can't fight a man.

462
00:54:03,790 --> 00:54:07,419
You wench! Kick, bite, scratch!

463
00:54:09,070 --> 00:54:11,026
Now come on.

464
00:54:11,910 --> 00:54:13,866
Fight me.

465
00:54:16,270 --> 00:54:18,659
I will not lift one finger to resist you.

466
00:54:28,150 --> 00:54:31,540
Whatever you do
will be on your conscience.

467
00:54:34,430 --> 00:54:37,581
Then let it be on my conscience.

468
00:54:46,870 --> 00:54:48,986
- I've come to help you escape.
- Escape?

469
00:54:49,110 --> 00:54:52,819
- I've stolen a ship.
- My lady, it's a tiny boat. We'll drown.

470
00:54:52,950 --> 00:54:54,542
- Are you afraid?
- Yes.

471
00:54:54,670 --> 00:54:57,104
- Will you come with me?
- Yes.

472
00:54:57,230 --> 00:54:59,790
My lady, how do you know
you can trust this slave?

473
00:54:59,910 --> 00:55:03,107
I know. If you don't want
to come, you can stay.

474
00:55:03,230 --> 00:55:05,460
Wait. Wait for me.

475
00:55:38,390 --> 00:55:41,462
Our only chance
is to get far away by morning.

476
00:55:41,590 --> 00:55:43,785
Yes, I can see that.

477
00:55:45,390 --> 00:55:48,587
We'd go a lot faster if we all rowed.

478
00:55:48,710 --> 00:55:50,860
Would we?

479
00:55:50,990 --> 00:55:53,424
Yes, we would.

480
00:55:53,550 --> 00:55:55,620
Do you mean that I should row this boat?

481
00:55:56,670 --> 00:55:58,900
Yes, I do mean that.

482
00:56:00,110 --> 00:56:02,226
Impossible.

483
00:56:02,350 --> 00:56:05,865
- Get an oar and row.
- But a princess doesn't row a boat.

484
00:56:05,990 --> 00:56:11,348
- Get an oar and row.
- But I can't. I don't know how.

485
00:56:16,310 --> 00:56:19,620
Learn. You too.

486
00:56:23,150 --> 00:56:24,503
Oh!

487
00:56:38,190 --> 00:56:42,786
- What's the matter now?
- This bodice is too tight. I'll have to stop.

488
00:56:42,910 --> 00:56:45,629
- What's a bodice?
- This dress I'm wearing.

489
00:56:45,750 --> 00:56:48,742
It's too tight right in there... Oh!

490
00:56:49,910 --> 00:56:53,266
- Row.
- Mine isn't too tight.

491
00:57:44,670 --> 00:57:47,264
Eric, look!

492
00:57:51,870 --> 00:57:54,987
It's Einar. Turn! Turn!

493
00:58:38,310 --> 00:58:42,826
- They are heading for the fog.
- We'll get them!

494
00:58:45,070 --> 00:58:48,380
- We can't go into the fog.
- Keep rowing.

495
00:59:36,390 --> 00:59:38,426
Faster! Faster!

496
00:59:38,950 --> 00:59:41,384
The men are afraid
we'll run aground. So am I.

497
00:59:41,510 --> 00:59:43,819
Keep rowing!

498
00:59:46,350 --> 00:59:49,387
Faster! Faster!

499
01:00:03,390 --> 01:00:05,221
Look out!

500
01:00:08,630 --> 01:00:10,780
Grab hold of the mast.

501
01:00:10,910 --> 01:00:12,662
Stop rowing.

502
01:00:13,390 --> 01:00:17,019
Odin! Odin!

503
01:00:18,590 --> 01:00:20,899
I'm going under!

504
01:00:22,950 --> 01:00:24,906
Hold on!

505
01:00:25,590 --> 01:00:27,740
Lift me out.

506
01:01:24,190 --> 01:01:25,259
Oh!

507
01:01:33,990 --> 01:01:36,106
Over here!

508
01:01:36,870 --> 01:01:38,098
Over here!

509
01:01:40,110 --> 01:01:42,305
<i>(Einar)</i> Back to your oars!

510
01:01:43,230 --> 01:01:45,585
- Back to your oars!
- Give up the chase.

511
01:01:45,710 --> 01:01:48,224
Morgana's out there! After them!

512
01:01:48,350 --> 01:01:53,140
The Great Snake is sunk.
You want to wreck this ship too?

513
01:01:53,270 --> 01:01:55,022
Ragnar.

514
01:01:55,150 --> 01:01:58,028
Ragnar! Ragnar!

515
01:01:59,590 --> 01:02:03,708
- Where's Ragnar?
- At the bottom of the fjord.

516
01:02:08,110 --> 01:02:11,386
The curse of Odin on that slave!

517
01:02:14,750 --> 01:02:19,062
If I have to cross the poison sea,
I'll find him.

518
01:02:19,190 --> 01:02:24,389
I swear it...
by the sacred blood of Odin.

519
01:02:52,990 --> 01:02:55,140
Still afraid?

520
01:02:55,270 --> 01:02:59,786
No. I'm worth more alive
than dead. Are you?

521
01:02:59,910 --> 01:03:03,789
No. But I value my life much more now.

522
01:03:06,230 --> 01:03:12,146
Of course, I'm grateful to you for saving
me and Aella will certainly reward you...

523
01:03:12,270 --> 01:03:14,704
- Why should I take you back to Aella?
- But you must.

524
01:03:14,830 --> 01:03:16,548
Why?

525
01:03:17,310 --> 01:03:20,461
I'm pledged to him on my father's word.

526
01:03:21,310 --> 01:03:24,825
I didn't steal you away
just to give you to another man.

527
01:03:26,510 --> 01:03:30,139
Aella isn't another man. He's a king.

528
01:03:30,590 --> 01:03:32,626
And I'm a slave.

529
01:03:34,110 --> 01:03:37,022
And I loved you the moment I saw you.

530
01:03:38,670 --> 01:03:41,230
I loved you even before then.

531
01:03:42,790 --> 01:03:45,179
Kitala saw it in the runes.

532
01:03:49,750 --> 01:03:52,947
That's just Kitala's silly talk.

533
01:03:57,270 --> 01:03:59,420
Do you love Aella?

534
01:04:03,950 --> 01:04:09,263
I belong to him...
by my father's word as a Christian king.

535
01:04:10,070 --> 01:04:13,824
What's your father's word
compared to Odin's will?

536
01:04:15,950 --> 01:04:19,147
Do you know which of all the oceans
is the widest?

537
01:04:19,270 --> 01:04:21,830
The poison sea.

538
01:04:23,310 --> 01:04:25,107
No.

539
01:04:25,230 --> 01:04:28,188
The ocean between
a Christian and a heathen.

540
01:04:30,150 --> 01:04:33,586
Our hands can reach across it
as easily as that.

541
01:04:33,710 --> 01:04:35,940
But that's just a joining of the flesh.

542
01:04:36,390 --> 01:04:41,100
- What else is missing?
- The joining of our souls.

543
01:04:41,230 --> 01:04:44,461
If our hands are touching,
our souls must be touching.

544
01:04:44,590 --> 01:04:46,899
But your soul is heathen.

545
01:04:47,790 --> 01:04:52,784
If my soul is content to be heathen
and yours content to be Christian,

546
01:04:52,910 --> 01:04:56,903
let's not question flesh
for wanting to remain flesh.

547
01:05:18,910 --> 01:05:20,866
Kitala.

548
01:05:24,390 --> 01:05:26,665
We'll be in England soon.

549
01:05:39,030 --> 01:05:42,227
Suppose Aella releases you
from your pledge.

550
01:05:43,310 --> 01:05:45,904
Then I'd be free.

551
01:05:46,030 --> 01:05:47,986
But why should he?

552
01:05:48,750 --> 01:05:50,980
I'll find a way.

553
01:05:52,910 --> 01:05:55,708
How can I make you understand?

554
01:05:58,910 --> 01:06:02,141
What would be the worst thing
for a Viking?

555
01:06:05,510 --> 01:06:10,026
To die without a sword in his hand
and never enter Valhalla.

556
01:06:10,150 --> 01:06:14,223
For me to break my pledge to Aella
would be as bad as that.

557
01:06:33,830 --> 01:06:35,900
I'll find a way.

558
01:06:45,390 --> 01:06:49,019
You captured Ragnar single-handed?

559
01:06:50,350 --> 01:06:52,306
We all owe you our thanks.

560
01:06:52,430 --> 01:06:55,547
I don't want your thanks. I want Morgana.

561
01:06:56,910 --> 01:07:01,426
This barbarian is under the illusion you
desire to be released from your pledge.

562
01:07:01,550 --> 01:07:03,620
Do you release me?

563
01:07:03,750 --> 01:07:06,742
Surely you don't want to be released?

564
01:07:06,870 --> 01:07:09,020
- Yes, I do.
- That is absurd.

565
01:07:09,150 --> 01:07:11,584
- Sire, you gave your word.
- Of course.

566
01:07:11,710 --> 01:07:13,905
But first things first.

567
01:07:14,030 --> 01:07:17,864
Father Godwin, take the
Princess Morgana to the chapel,

568
01:07:17,990 --> 01:07:21,744
that she may meditate
before making a final decision.

569
01:07:22,910 --> 01:07:24,866
Yes, sire.

570
01:07:33,630 --> 01:07:37,543
Well, gentlemen,
let us proceed to the kennels.

571
01:07:37,670 --> 01:07:39,945
The royal pets are hungry.

572
01:07:40,070 --> 01:07:42,026
Take him.

573
01:08:15,070 --> 01:08:17,664
That stone, my lady...

574
01:08:20,790 --> 01:08:23,543
- Where did you get it?
- Eric gave it to me.

575
01:08:23,670 --> 01:08:25,422
Where did he get it?

576
01:08:25,550 --> 01:08:30,385
He said it was tied around his neck
when the Vikings captured him as a baby.

577
01:08:31,710 --> 01:08:33,666
<i>(wolves barking)</i>

578
01:09:11,230 --> 01:09:15,940
Since you brought him here,
the pleasure shall be yours.

579
01:09:17,110 --> 01:09:19,066
Push him in.

580
01:09:34,150 --> 01:09:37,062
I claim the right of a Viking
to die with a sword in my hand.

581
01:09:37,190 --> 01:09:39,784
And I deny you that right.

582
01:09:39,910 --> 01:09:42,982
Go ahead. Push him in.

583
01:09:45,790 --> 01:09:48,463
Cut my bonds and give me the sword.

584
01:09:48,590 --> 01:09:50,740
Why should I?

585
01:09:52,950 --> 01:09:55,544
Would you deny me
the right to enter Valhalla?

586
01:10:16,430 --> 01:10:18,785
What are you doing?

587
01:10:32,470 --> 01:10:34,700
You dare give him that sword?

588
01:10:48,150 --> 01:10:50,106
<i>(yells)</i>

589
01:10:51,150 --> 01:10:53,027
<i>(laughs)</i>

590
01:10:56,630 --> 01:10:57,983
Odin!

591
01:10:58,110 --> 01:11:00,066
<i>(wolves snarl)</i>

592
01:11:15,590 --> 01:11:17,421
And Einar is his brother.

593
01:11:17,550 --> 01:11:20,860
And Eric has surrendered
his own father to Aella.

594
01:11:20,990 --> 01:11:24,187
Oh, Father Godwin,
we must try to stop him.

595
01:11:24,310 --> 01:11:26,983
Yes. Come.

596
01:11:30,870 --> 01:11:33,782
You have dared to defy a king.

597
01:11:33,910 --> 01:11:36,504
You shall join Ragnar in the pit.

598
01:11:37,390 --> 01:11:40,143
I want all here to see the reward
for such defiance.

599
01:11:40,270 --> 01:11:42,830
Your Majesty,
I would ask you to bear in mind

600
01:11:42,950 --> 01:11:47,580
that I made good your promise
in the name of Holy Mother Church.

601
01:11:52,230 --> 01:11:57,827
Thank you, Father Godwin.
You are the watchdog of my fury.

602
01:11:58,510 --> 01:12:00,944
But if a common slave
can rob me of a queen

603
01:12:01,070 --> 01:12:04,187
and slay an enemy too cunning
for a whole nation to defeat,

604
01:12:04,310 --> 01:12:09,020
then the day must come when he will be
a deadlier foe than Ragnar ever was.

605
01:12:09,150 --> 01:12:13,541
With or without God's sanction,
I tell you as your king this cannot be.

606
01:12:13,670 --> 01:12:16,707
- Aella...
- Yes, my dear?

607
01:12:16,830 --> 01:12:20,823
I will keep my pledge to you.
Don't kill him.

608
01:12:27,670 --> 01:12:32,619
In that case, nothing could distress me
more than for you to think me cruel.

609
01:12:32,750 --> 01:12:34,866
Then let him go.

610
01:12:42,870 --> 01:12:45,338
Hold out the hand that has defied me.

611
01:13:04,110 --> 01:13:06,066
<i>(groans)</i>

612
01:13:15,830 --> 01:13:19,459
Let this serve as a lesson
to all Vikings.

613
01:13:19,590 --> 01:13:22,468
Take him to his ship and cast him adrift.

614
01:13:24,390 --> 01:13:26,062
Eric!

615
01:13:28,230 --> 01:13:30,380
Why do we wait?

616
01:13:31,710 --> 01:13:36,989
Because of a slave, my father's bones
lie now at the bottom of the fjord.

617
01:13:38,230 --> 01:13:44,146
Ragnar was your king.
But he had no Viking's burial.

618
01:13:45,870 --> 01:13:51,069
I have sworn by the blood of Odin
to avenge my father's death.

619
01:13:54,870 --> 01:13:56,747
Why do we wait?

620
01:13:56,870 --> 01:13:58,940
We must mourn Ragnar.

621
01:13:59,430 --> 01:14:02,342
It's revenge Ragnar wants, not mourning.

622
01:14:02,790 --> 01:14:06,465
Every Viking wants to revenge
the death of Ragnar.

623
01:14:06,590 --> 01:14:09,184
Then let's go to England now
for the girl and the slave.

624
01:14:09,310 --> 01:14:11,346
We don't even know where they are.

625
01:14:11,470 --> 01:14:15,668
Where would the slave go but to Aella's
castle to be rewarded for his treachery?

626
01:14:15,790 --> 01:14:18,862
Perhaps, but what chance
would we have?

627
01:14:18,990 --> 01:14:21,902
Aella's castle is the strongest
in all of England.

628
01:14:22,030 --> 01:14:25,181
I know Aella's castle well.
Here are the maps.

629
01:14:25,310 --> 01:14:27,744
Einar has studied every stone and beam.

630
01:14:27,870 --> 01:14:30,623
To reach the castle,
we'll have to hug the English coast.

631
01:14:30,750 --> 01:14:33,662
They will have days
to prepare for our attack.

632
01:14:36,270 --> 01:14:40,388
We don't hug the coast.
We sail across the open sea.

633
01:14:40,510 --> 01:14:45,106
- And if there's fog?
- Can't we do what a slave did?

634
01:14:45,630 --> 01:14:48,702
The slave used witchcraft.

635
01:14:48,830 --> 01:14:52,789
His eyes saw through the fog
to the stars.

636
01:14:54,350 --> 01:14:56,341
Are you afraid, Bjorn?

637
01:14:56,830 --> 01:15:00,379
Do not confuse fear for caution.

638
01:15:00,510 --> 01:15:03,502
Odin has sent no sign.

639
01:15:05,110 --> 01:15:08,182
Then you can stay here.

640
01:15:08,310 --> 01:15:13,782
But we go to avenge Ragnar's death.
Who sails with me?

641
01:15:35,910 --> 01:15:39,061
Not even enough to man one ship.

642
01:16:13,270 --> 01:16:15,500
Odin.

643
01:16:17,150 --> 01:16:19,220
Odin.

644
01:16:28,670 --> 01:16:31,423
Odin must have answered me.

645
01:16:33,790 --> 01:16:37,021
- Where's Morgana?
- In Aella's castle.

646
01:16:37,150 --> 01:16:39,584
You dare to come back here
just to tell me this?

647
01:16:39,710 --> 01:16:42,270
No. I need you and your men
to take the castle,

648
01:16:42,390 --> 01:16:45,382
and you need me to guide you
across the open sea.

649
01:16:45,510 --> 01:16:47,865
Why should you want me
to free Morgana?

650
01:16:48,230 --> 01:16:51,108
Because she shall be my wife.

651
01:16:55,230 --> 01:16:57,460
All right, slave...

652
01:16:58,510 --> 01:17:01,343
you live until Morgana's free.

653
01:17:02,790 --> 01:17:05,827
Vikings! Vikings!

654
01:17:05,950 --> 01:17:08,987
- Odin <i>has</i> sent us a sign.
- Kill him!

655
01:17:13,590 --> 01:17:15,899
Listen to me!

656
01:17:16,030 --> 01:17:21,229
Make no mistake, I hate this slave
more than any living man.

657
01:17:21,350 --> 01:17:23,306
But he can guide us to Morgana.

658
01:17:23,430 --> 01:17:29,699
What matters more to you, a foreign
wench or vengeance for Ragnar?

659
01:17:32,270 --> 01:17:37,503
Because of him, your father lies
at the bottom of the fjord.

660
01:17:37,630 --> 01:17:41,384
That's not true! Ragnar died in England!

661
01:17:41,510 --> 01:17:43,865
<i>(murmuring, then hush)</i>

662
01:17:47,710 --> 01:17:51,385
In the fog he swam to my boat.
I took him there.

663
01:17:57,870 --> 01:17:59,861
How did Ragnar die?

664
01:18:01,350 --> 01:18:05,389
Aella ordered him bound
and thrown alive into the wolf pit.

665
01:18:07,190 --> 01:18:10,944
Ragnar, bound like a sheep
and thrown to wolves?

666
01:18:11,310 --> 01:18:13,505
I cut his bonds.

667
01:18:13,630 --> 01:18:16,508
He died fighting
with the sword I gave him.

668
01:18:16,630 --> 01:18:22,068
And this was my thanks from Aella
for letting Ragnar die like a Viking.

669
01:18:32,830 --> 01:18:35,264
Now you know how Ragnar died.

670
01:18:36,070 --> 01:18:38,345
His eyes can lead us to Aella.

671
01:18:38,470 --> 01:18:40,426
Now!

672
01:18:41,790 --> 01:18:43,781
Who sails with me?

673
01:18:43,910 --> 01:18:45,628
- I will!
- I will!

674
01:18:47,590 --> 01:18:49,182
Hail, Einar!

675
01:18:49,310 --> 01:18:55,146
Hail, Einar! Hail, Einar! Hail, Einar!

676
01:18:55,270 --> 01:18:57,226
<i>(horn)</i>

677
01:21:01,110 --> 01:21:02,907
Strange, isn't it?

678
01:21:03,030 --> 01:21:07,103
I was going to take you to England
and now you're taking me.

679
01:21:08,750 --> 01:21:13,426
Do you still have that stone
you wear about your neck?

680
01:21:13,550 --> 01:21:15,825
No, it's gone.

681
01:21:15,950 --> 01:21:19,829
Oh. Just as well.

682
01:21:19,950 --> 01:21:21,906
Why?

683
01:21:22,550 --> 01:21:25,110
I used to think it would bring me luck.

684
01:21:25,230 --> 01:21:29,303
Now neither of us
will have any use for it.

685
01:21:51,430 --> 01:21:54,422
<i>(horn call)</i>

686
01:26:26,430 --> 01:26:28,864
The Vikings!

687
01:26:40,990 --> 01:26:43,458
It's the Vikings!

688
01:26:56,510 --> 01:26:58,785
The Vikings!

689
01:30:04,830 --> 01:30:07,708
Egbert, where would Morgana be?

690
01:30:08,990 --> 01:30:12,300
The safest place is the tower chapel.

691
01:31:36,470 --> 01:31:38,426
Odin!

692
01:32:35,230 --> 01:32:37,790
<i>(cheering)</i>

693
01:33:46,070 --> 01:33:49,858
Be assured, sire, the second drawbridge
is much stronger than the first.

694
01:36:14,710 --> 01:36:17,429
<i>(yells)</i>

695
01:37:33,990 --> 01:37:35,946
Odin!

696
01:37:37,710 --> 01:37:39,462
Odin!

697
01:38:34,470 --> 01:38:36,426
<i>(wolves growling)</i>

698
01:38:50,790 --> 01:38:52,462
Aella!

699
01:39:05,830 --> 01:39:07,183
<i>(screams)</i>

700
01:39:07,550 --> 01:39:09,347
<i>(shouting outside)</i>

701
01:40:32,870 --> 01:40:35,543
Take your magic elsewhere, holy man.

702
01:40:36,790 --> 01:40:39,463
This chapel is a sanctuary.

703
01:40:42,150 --> 01:40:43,902
Father Godwin!

704
01:41:08,550 --> 01:41:10,780
Go ahead, jump.

705
01:41:32,710 --> 01:41:35,099
You will be my queen.

706
01:41:38,670 --> 01:41:40,786
I knew it the first moment I saw you.

707
01:41:41,510 --> 01:41:46,186
You knew it too.
You knew it that night on my ship.

708
01:41:47,910 --> 01:41:50,629
- It's not true.
- Yes.

709
01:41:52,590 --> 01:41:54,546
It is true.

710
01:41:55,350 --> 01:41:57,500
I don't love you.

711
01:42:00,590 --> 01:42:03,946
You must love me exactly as I love you.

712
01:42:07,310 --> 01:42:10,188
I hate you! It's Eric I love.

713
01:42:36,910 --> 01:42:41,620
- Where are you taking me?
- To see Eric... for the last time.

714
01:42:41,750 --> 01:42:44,787
Don't kill him. You can't.

715
01:42:44,910 --> 01:42:48,266
Look at this. It's from the pommel
of the sword Requitur.

716
01:42:48,390 --> 01:42:51,826
It was given to Eric by his mother,
Enid the queen.

717
01:42:51,950 --> 01:42:55,260
Oh, listen to me! Ragnar was his father!

718
01:42:55,390 --> 01:42:57,585
Lies won't save him!

719
01:42:57,710 --> 01:43:00,383
It's true. I swear it is.

720
01:43:00,510 --> 01:43:02,705
He is your brother!

721
01:43:05,350 --> 01:43:06,339
Eric!

722
01:43:21,590 --> 01:43:25,060
Look at him,
how he hastens to his death.

723
01:43:25,190 --> 01:43:27,260
He can't wait to die.

724
01:43:33,230 --> 01:43:37,189
If I can't have your love,
I'll take your hate.

725
01:44:33,270 --> 01:44:34,623
<i>(yells)</i>

726
01:46:13,870 --> 01:46:16,338
Why did he hesitate?

727
01:47:07,070 --> 01:47:09,026
Odin!

728
01:47:16,270 --> 01:47:19,228
Prepare a funeral for a Viking.
