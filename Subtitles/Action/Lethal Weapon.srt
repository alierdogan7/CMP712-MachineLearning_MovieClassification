1
00:04:39,970 --> 00:04:41,722
Surprise!

2
00:04:42,290 --> 00:04:44,804
Happy Birthday, Daddy!

3
00:04:53,890 --> 00:04:55,403
Make a wish!

4
00:04:55,650 --> 00:04:57,641
I wish...
I'm not going to tell you.

5
00:04:57,890 --> 00:04:59,687
Come on, blow them out!

6
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:06,049
Give me some sugar, girl.

7
00:05:06,530 --> 00:05:09,363
One more candle and the smoke alarm
would've gone off.

8
00:05:13,570 --> 00:05:15,003
The big 5-0.

9
00:05:16,730 --> 00:05:20,166
You know, your beard's getting gray.
Kind of makes you look old.

10
00:05:20,370 --> 00:05:22,167
It's all right. I still love you.

11
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:24,809
Bye, Pa.

12
00:07:08,450 --> 00:07:10,759
Good morning!

13
00:07:11,290 --> 00:07:13,850
-Where's Rianne?
-She's upstairs.

14
00:07:15,210 --> 00:07:16,848
Good morning.

15
00:07:17,050 --> 00:07:19,006
-That's my bacon!
-It's mine now.

16
00:07:19,210 --> 00:07:21,280
Don't you close doors around here?

17
00:07:21,490 --> 00:07:23,128
Baby, what's this on my tie?

18
00:07:24,570 --> 00:07:26,083
That is an ugly spot.

19
00:07:26,330 --> 00:07:28,446
Thanks. Sharp as a tack.

20
00:07:28,730 --> 00:07:30,960
I'm thinking of going on Jeopardy.

21
00:07:31,610 --> 00:07:33,919
Just don't take any questions
about cooking.

22
00:07:38,170 --> 00:07:39,922
Don't step in the egg!

23
00:07:41,090 --> 00:07:44,400
What am I thinking? I should have
checked the floor for egg!

24
00:07:46,170 --> 00:07:49,560
Do you know a man named Michael Hunsaker?

25
00:07:52,450 --> 00:07:54,327
Jesus! Michael Hunsaker!

26
00:07:54,690 --> 00:07:56,521
-What did he want?
-Your office called.

27
00:07:56,850 --> 00:07:58,886
He's tried to reach you for three days.

28
00:07:59,130 --> 00:08:00,882
I haven't talked to him in...

29
00:08:02,610 --> 00:08:03,884
...twelve years!

30
00:08:04,690 --> 00:08:05,964
Wait a minute.

31
00:08:06,170 --> 00:08:08,081
That would make me...

32
00:08:09,050 --> 00:08:10,324
...fifty!

33
00:08:10,970 --> 00:08:12,403
That means that you're...

34
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:14,889
We're not gonna discuss it.

35
00:08:15,130 --> 00:08:16,722
Forget the eggs.

36
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:22,480
How come I never heard
of Michael Hunsaker?

37
00:08:22,730 --> 00:08:24,368
Just never talked about him.

38
00:08:24,610 --> 00:08:26,009
Vietnam buddy?

39
00:08:26,330 --> 00:08:28,241
Eat your own cake. Vietnam buddy.

40
00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:31,768
Nick and the kids left without me.

41
00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:35,286
He left without you? Come on,
I never get enough of my baby.

42
00:08:35,530 --> 00:08:39,045
This is my New Year's Eve dress.
Do you like it? Isn't it cool?

43
00:08:39,290 --> 00:08:40,609
It's beautiful.

44
00:08:42,450 --> 00:08:44,202
Have a good birthday.

45
00:08:52,410 --> 00:08:54,002
Goddamn heartbreaker!

46
00:09:06,650 --> 00:09:08,561
Happy birthday, Rog!

47
00:09:17,810 --> 00:09:19,129
We got a hooker.

48
00:09:19,410 --> 00:09:22,800
No, it's Dixie. Would you please
tell these bozos to lay off?

49
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:24,285
You bozos, lay off.

50
00:09:24,530 --> 00:09:27,124
Had a jumper here last night.
She saw it happen.

51
00:09:27,410 --> 00:09:29,207
Get her statement, send her home.

52
00:09:29,490 --> 00:09:32,004
Thanks. I'm beat.
You know how it is.

53
00:09:32,730 --> 00:09:34,368
All dressed up, no one to blow.

54
00:09:35,290 --> 00:09:38,009
You're hilarious!
I can't believe you damn cops!

55
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:40,810
The jumper's name is Amanda Hunsaker.

56
00:09:41,570 --> 00:09:43,128
Age 22.

57
00:09:43,410 --> 00:09:47,198
Prostitute. One arrest,
no convictions. Born in Tennessee.

58
00:09:47,450 --> 00:09:49,042
-Parents...
-What was the name?

59
00:09:50,330 --> 00:09:51,809
The parents.

60
00:09:52,850 --> 00:09:54,329
Michael and Claire.

61
00:09:55,490 --> 00:09:56,718
You know them?

62
00:09:57,690 --> 00:10:00,602
Right. Find out who bought it,
who's paying the bills.

63
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:03,318
-That will take some looking into.
-So look!

64
00:10:29,290 --> 00:10:30,609
Hello, honey.

65
00:10:31,770 --> 00:10:34,159
Give me the number for Michael Hunsaker.

66
00:10:34,450 --> 00:10:36,964
The man we talked about?
Your Vietnam buddy?

67
00:10:37,210 --> 00:10:40,247
-You just mentioned him this morning.
-What's wrong?

68
00:10:40,450 --> 00:10:42,645
His daughter just dove out a window.

69
00:10:47,330 --> 00:10:48,524
I got it.

70
00:11:07,130 --> 00:11:08,961
Good, huh? Tasty? Smooth?

71
00:11:11,930 --> 00:11:14,649
-Yeah, that's good.
-You better fucking believe it.

72
00:11:15,290 --> 00:11:16,882
Let's do it. How much?

73
00:11:17,130 --> 00:11:18,768
How much for how much?

74
00:11:19,490 --> 00:11:20,605
For all of it.

75
00:11:20,850 --> 00:11:23,808
You want it all? He wants it all.

76
00:11:24,010 --> 00:11:26,808
-All right!
-Maybe a nice tree to put it under.

77
00:11:27,570 --> 00:11:28,969
You want a tree?

78
00:11:29,210 --> 00:11:30,643
I'll tell you what.

79
00:11:30,970 --> 00:11:33,689
I'll give you the best tree
on the lot for nothing.

80
00:11:34,330 --> 00:11:36,241
But the shit's gonna cost you...

81
00:11:37,050 --> 00:11:38,165
...a hundred.

82
00:11:38,450 --> 00:11:39,280
That much?

83
00:11:39,570 --> 00:11:41,242
That's a fair price.

84
00:11:43,530 --> 00:11:44,724
You only live once.

85
00:11:45,570 --> 00:11:46,798
Get this together here.

86
00:11:48,210 --> 00:11:49,802
20, 40...

87
00:11:50,050 --> 00:11:51,165
...50, 70....

88
00:11:51,370 --> 00:11:54,407
-What the fuck?
-Hey, man!

89
00:11:55,690 --> 00:11:57,009
Shut up, I'm losing count.

90
00:11:57,410 --> 00:11:59,765
93, 94, 95, 96....

91
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:01,478
Forget it, dumbshit!

92
00:12:02,090 --> 00:12:03,728
One hundred thousand!

93
00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:06,320
One hundred thousand dollars!

94
00:12:07,770 --> 00:12:09,203
A hundred thousand?

95
00:12:09,530 --> 00:12:13,728
I can't afford that. Not on my salary.
But look, I got a better idea.

96
00:12:14,170 --> 00:12:18,322
Let me say I take the whole stash
off your hands for free...

97
00:12:19,490 --> 00:12:22,323
...and you assholes go to jail.
What do you say?

98
00:12:24,090 --> 00:12:28,083
I could read you your rights, but you
already know what your rights are.

99
00:12:31,730 --> 00:12:33,129
This badge ain't real.

100
00:12:33,570 --> 00:12:34,605
You ain't real.

101
00:12:34,850 --> 00:12:37,159
You sure are a crazy son of a bitch.

102
00:12:39,490 --> 00:12:40,445
I'm crazy?

103
00:12:41,490 --> 00:12:43,446
You think I am crazy?

104
00:12:43,650 --> 00:12:45,208
I'll show you...

105
00:12:48,730 --> 00:12:51,483
That's a real badge, I'm a real cop
and this is a real gun.

106
00:12:52,810 --> 00:12:53,720
Okay, pal.

107
00:12:54,090 --> 00:12:55,648
Noses in the dirt, assholes!

108
00:13:07,490 --> 00:13:08,718
Where's your buddy?

109
00:13:12,690 --> 00:13:13,566
What do you got?

110
00:13:13,850 --> 00:13:17,001
Three down and one loose.
He's got a red shirt.

111
00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:18,603
Okay, let's go.

112
00:13:20,570 --> 00:13:23,289
Freeze! Give me the gun! Up, up!

113
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:25,842
How's it feel, sucker?

114
00:13:26,450 --> 00:13:27,326
Shoot him!

115
00:13:27,610 --> 00:13:28,486
Drop it!

116
00:13:28,770 --> 00:13:30,328
Shoot him! Shoot him!

117
00:13:30,690 --> 00:13:32,999
-Shut the fuck up!
-Shoot this prick!

118
00:13:34,170 --> 00:13:36,559
Shoot him! Somebody shoot this prick!

119
00:13:36,890 --> 00:13:38,164
Shoot me.

120
00:13:38,490 --> 00:13:40,640
Shut up! Put them down!

121
00:13:41,010 --> 00:13:43,922
-I warn you! I'm going to shoot you!
-Shoot him!

122
00:13:44,170 --> 00:13:45,888
Shut the fuck up! Shut up!

123
00:13:46,130 --> 00:13:48,166
Shoot me! Shoot him!

124
00:13:55,410 --> 00:13:56,729
Get him out of there.

125
00:13:58,170 --> 00:13:59,603
It ain't worth it.

126
00:14:08,010 --> 00:14:09,409
Hey, wait up already!

127
00:16:31,810 --> 00:16:33,402
Merry Christmas!

128
00:17:00,530 --> 00:17:02,248
I miss you...

129
00:17:04,810 --> 00:17:06,402
...Victoria Lynn.

130
00:17:19,810 --> 00:17:21,721
That's silly, isn't it?

131
00:17:27,290 --> 00:17:29,008
I'll see you later.

132
00:17:30,770 --> 00:17:32,601
I'll see you much later.

133
00:17:38,490 --> 00:17:41,050
Once more with feeling on three.

134
00:17:42,010 --> 00:17:45,844
Damn it, Cooley. Do it on three,
or go on the street.

135
00:17:50,290 --> 00:17:52,850
Silent night

136
00:17:53,730 --> 00:17:56,244
Are you telling me
Riggs is playing a game?

137
00:17:56,570 --> 00:17:59,767
Sure. He wants the cash.
But he'll come around.

138
00:18:00,090 --> 00:18:02,240
That's a very dangerous
attitude to take.

139
00:18:02,490 --> 00:18:06,961
Remember, his wife of 11 years
was just killed in a car accident.

140
00:18:07,330 --> 00:18:10,959
-He pulls his gun when he shouldn't.
-I know all about him.

141
00:18:11,210 --> 00:18:12,359
He's a tough bastard.

142
00:18:12,570 --> 00:18:15,687
He's on the edge. I'm telling you,
he may be psychotic.

143
00:18:15,890 --> 00:18:17,767
That's a bunch of psych bullshit.

144
00:18:17,970 --> 00:18:20,723
You're making a mistake
by keeping him in the field.

145
00:18:21,050 --> 00:18:22,642
The man is suicidal.

146
00:18:22,890 --> 00:18:25,563
You're sure of that diagnosis?
You have no doubts?

147
00:18:25,850 --> 00:18:27,442
There are no absolutes in life.

148
00:18:27,690 --> 00:18:30,158
End of discussion.
We're going to wait.

149
00:18:30,490 --> 00:18:33,004
If he offs himself,
then we'll know I was wrong.

150
00:18:33,210 --> 00:18:36,407
You're making a mistake,
because if you're wrong...

151
00:18:43,290 --> 00:18:44,882
Asshole!

152
00:18:45,410 --> 00:18:47,924
Roger, you're way behind the times.

153
00:18:48,170 --> 00:18:51,924
The guys in the 80s aren't tough.
They're sensitive people.

154
00:18:52,290 --> 00:18:55,168
They show emotions around women,
shit like that.

155
00:18:56,850 --> 00:18:58,329
I think I'm an 80s man.

156
00:18:58,570 --> 00:19:00,003
How do you figure?

157
00:19:00,250 --> 00:19:01,603
Last night...

158
00:19:02,010 --> 00:19:03,921
...I cried in bed. How's that?

159
00:19:06,850 --> 00:19:08,442
Were you with a woman?

160
00:19:08,890 --> 00:19:12,200
I was alone. Why do you think
I was crying? Merry Christmas.

161
00:19:12,450 --> 00:19:14,486
Sounds like an 80s man to me.

162
00:19:15,290 --> 00:19:17,520
-News on the Hunsaker case.
-That was quick.

163
00:19:17,770 --> 00:19:21,046
So was the autopsy.
They're not calling it a suicide.

164
00:19:21,650 --> 00:19:25,404
Surprise, surprise. The coroner
found evidence she used barbiturates.

165
00:19:26,090 --> 00:19:27,523
Brilliant detective work.

166
00:19:27,730 --> 00:19:29,368
There were pills all over.

167
00:19:29,650 --> 00:19:31,880
Right. That's not the surprise.

168
00:19:32,210 --> 00:19:34,565
The surprise is the pills were doctored.

169
00:19:35,130 --> 00:19:37,519
The capsules were loaded with drain cleaner.

170
00:19:37,730 --> 00:19:38,879
She'd have died anyway.

171
00:19:39,090 --> 00:19:40,045
This case stinks.

172
00:19:40,290 --> 00:19:43,885
You know, you looked younger with the beard.

173
00:19:44,490 --> 00:19:45,809
Thanks, captain.

174
00:19:47,570 --> 00:19:48,605
You shaved the beard.

175
00:19:49,050 --> 00:19:50,244
Some detective.

176
00:19:50,770 --> 00:19:51,998
Two more things.

177
00:19:52,890 --> 00:19:55,245
The condition of the sheets indicates...

178
00:19:55,570 --> 00:19:58,448
...someone else was in bed with Amanda.
That's "A"

179
00:19:58,650 --> 00:19:59,560
What's "B"?

180
00:19:59,890 --> 00:20:02,962
"B" is, you're breaking in
a new partner on this.

181
00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:04,205
Partner again?

182
00:20:04,450 --> 00:20:07,760
Some cat on loan from Dope.
Real burnout, on the edge.

183
00:20:08,090 --> 00:20:09,079
Perfect.

184
00:20:11,610 --> 00:20:12,520
Gun!

185
00:20:19,170 --> 00:20:20,808
Rog, meet your new partner.

186
00:20:24,450 --> 00:20:27,010
I'm too old for this shit.

187
00:20:31,130 --> 00:20:33,485
There are those who say you're a good cop.

188
00:20:33,730 --> 00:20:35,049
I try.

189
00:20:35,730 --> 00:20:39,564
I heard about the little stunt yesterday.
Pretty heroic.

190
00:20:41,730 --> 00:20:43,322
I pulled your file.

191
00:20:43,650 --> 00:20:47,245
Said you worked in the Phoenix
project in Vietnam. That right?

192
00:20:47,450 --> 00:20:50,283
Assassination stuff.
It's over, you know.

193
00:20:50,770 --> 00:20:51,998
What is?

194
00:20:52,690 --> 00:20:53,645
The war.

195
00:20:53,890 --> 00:20:55,403
Yes, I know.

196
00:20:55,730 --> 00:20:57,322
Just thought I'd remind you.

197
00:20:59,370 --> 00:21:01,600
That's some serious shit you carry.

198
00:21:03,010 --> 00:21:04,602
Be my guest.

199
00:21:09,250 --> 00:21:12,845
9mm Beretta. Takes 15 in the mag,
one up the pipe...

200
00:21:13,170 --> 00:21:16,606
...wide ejection port, no feed jams.

201
00:21:17,010 --> 00:21:18,045
What have you got?

202
00:21:18,290 --> 00:21:19,359
Four-inch Smith.

203
00:21:20,850 --> 00:21:21,885
Six-shooter?

204
00:21:23,410 --> 00:21:24,923
A lot of old-timers carry those.

205
00:21:29,130 --> 00:21:31,644
File also said you're heavy
into martial arts.

206
00:21:31,890 --> 00:21:35,121
Tai chi and all that killer stuff.

207
00:21:35,450 --> 00:21:38,601
I suppose we have to register you
as a lethal weapon.

208
00:21:39,410 --> 00:21:43,119
Let's just cut the shit.
We both know why I was transferred.

209
00:21:43,330 --> 00:21:47,482
Everybody thinks I'm suicidal,
so nobody wants to work with me.

210
00:21:47,730 --> 00:21:50,085
Some think I'm faking
to draw psycho pension...

211
00:21:50,330 --> 00:21:54,118
...so nobody wants to work with me.
Basically, I'm fucked.

212
00:21:54,330 --> 00:21:55,319
Guess what?

213
00:21:55,730 --> 00:21:57,129
I don't want to work with you.

214
00:21:57,330 --> 00:21:58,160
Then don't.

215
00:21:58,450 --> 00:22:02,363
Ain't got no choice.
Looks like we both got fucked.

216
00:22:02,570 --> 00:22:03,480
Terrific.

217
00:22:07,530 --> 00:22:09,202
God hates me, is what it is.

218
00:22:10,290 --> 00:22:12,406
Hate Him back. It works for me.

219
00:22:29,770 --> 00:22:32,125
-Good afternoon, Mr. Mendez.
-How you doing?

220
00:22:32,370 --> 00:22:33,564
Did you pat him down?

221
00:22:33,810 --> 00:22:36,370
-We went through this already.
-Go through it again.

222
00:22:36,690 --> 00:22:37,805
Who are you?

223
00:22:38,170 --> 00:22:41,003
That's hardly important,
but you may call me Mr. Joshua.

224
00:22:41,250 --> 00:22:42,239
Let's go.

225
00:22:42,450 --> 00:22:44,680
Great, swell. Mr. Joshua, huh?

226
00:22:49,250 --> 00:22:51,081
General, Mr. Mendez is here.

227
00:22:54,610 --> 00:22:58,285
You call this music? I can get
a better band for half the price.

228
00:22:58,610 --> 00:23:02,125
I don't want to hear any of this shit.
Let's get it right.

229
00:23:04,290 --> 00:23:06,281
Mr. Mendez, how are you?

230
00:23:06,690 --> 00:23:07,759
I'm fine.

231
00:23:08,410 --> 00:23:10,765
Where did you get him?
Psychos "R" Us?

232
00:23:10,970 --> 00:23:12,289
I don't think you're funny.

233
00:23:12,530 --> 00:23:15,124
I don't think this whole
goddamn setup is funny.

234
00:23:15,410 --> 00:23:17,970
You're using mercenaries.
Tell me I'm wrong!

235
00:23:18,370 --> 00:23:19,485
You're not wrong.

236
00:23:19,890 --> 00:23:22,085
And you expect me to trust these bozos?

237
00:23:22,330 --> 00:23:24,525
My people are loyal to me.

238
00:23:24,850 --> 00:23:26,283
Bullshit.

239
00:23:26,650 --> 00:23:27,719
Do you smoke?

240
00:23:27,970 --> 00:23:29,881
What does that have to do with it?

241
00:23:30,130 --> 00:23:30,960
Do you smoke?!

242
00:23:33,130 --> 00:23:34,358
Give me your lighter.

243
00:23:34,890 --> 00:23:36,528
-My lighter?
-Your lighter!

244
00:23:37,010 --> 00:23:38,204
Okay. Right here.

245
00:23:38,890 --> 00:23:39,925
Here. Take it.

246
00:23:40,130 --> 00:23:42,769
What the fuck is wrong with you guys?

247
00:23:43,090 --> 00:23:44,284
Shut your mouth!

248
00:23:44,570 --> 00:23:45,844
Shut up!

249
00:23:46,290 --> 00:23:47,564
And don't move.

250
00:23:51,570 --> 00:23:54,004
Mr. Joshua, your left arm, please.

251
00:24:02,450 --> 00:24:06,443
Hey, you guys are fucking gone.
You know what I am saying?

252
00:24:06,770 --> 00:24:08,681
Jesus Christ, man!

253
00:24:09,650 --> 00:24:12,847
You guys are fucking crazy, man. Come on!

254
00:24:17,410 --> 00:24:19,446
Have Endo look at that, Mr. Joshua.

255
00:24:21,450 --> 00:24:22,644
Yes, sir.

256
00:24:24,090 --> 00:24:26,126
You wish to do business with us, yes?

257
00:24:26,370 --> 00:24:27,485
Jesus Christ!

258
00:24:27,730 --> 00:24:30,005
You wish to make a purchase, yes?

259
00:24:31,290 --> 00:24:33,360
Yes, yes! Jesus Christ, yes.

260
00:24:35,650 --> 00:24:38,960
You guys are out there like
fucking Pluto, man. You're gone!

261
00:24:39,250 --> 00:24:43,209
The heroin will be here Friday night.
We'll make delivery at that time.

262
00:24:43,490 --> 00:24:45,526
Have the money ready, and no tricks.

263
00:24:45,810 --> 00:24:48,961
If you try anything,
you'll have to talk to Mr. Joshua.

264
00:24:50,130 --> 00:24:52,360
Right. Joshua. I got you.

265
00:24:53,330 --> 00:24:54,763
Merry Christmas.

266
00:24:54,970 --> 00:24:57,803
Yeah, right. You too, pal.

267
00:25:09,090 --> 00:25:10,284
Mike...

268
00:25:11,410 --> 00:25:16,006
...the autopsy report showed
that Amanda was poisoned.

269
00:25:16,890 --> 00:25:19,165
Even if she hadn't jumped,
she'd still be dead.

270
00:25:20,850 --> 00:25:23,410
She was murdered.

271
00:25:27,650 --> 00:25:29,003
Jesus!

272
00:25:33,290 --> 00:25:36,088
I can't take this.
I just can't take this.

273
00:25:39,930 --> 00:25:41,966
Why did you try
to get in touch with me?

274
00:25:45,650 --> 00:25:47,561
I heard that you were...

275
00:25:48,850 --> 00:25:51,569
Somebody told me you were
working out here.

276
00:25:53,730 --> 00:25:55,721
I thought you could get her out.

277
00:25:56,090 --> 00:25:57,603
Get her out of what?

278
00:26:00,410 --> 00:26:04,847
Get her out of the stuff she was into.
She was making...

279
00:26:05,410 --> 00:26:06,763
...videotapes.

280
00:26:08,570 --> 00:26:09,798
Pornographic...

281
00:26:11,090 --> 00:26:12,967
...videotapes.

282
00:26:13,330 --> 00:26:17,209
I thought maybe you could just
get her out. Help her.

283
00:26:30,450 --> 00:26:31,724
Easy, Mike.

284
00:26:38,410 --> 00:26:40,082
You owe me, Roger.

285
00:26:41,210 --> 00:26:42,165
Remember?

286
00:26:49,290 --> 00:26:50,484
I remember.

287
00:26:51,370 --> 00:26:54,442
I want you to find whoever's
responsible for this...

288
00:26:55,570 --> 00:26:57,800
...however many of them there are.

289
00:27:00,410 --> 00:27:04,085
I know you can do it.
Just find them and kill them.

290
00:27:04,410 --> 00:27:05,763
I'm a police officer.

291
00:27:05,970 --> 00:27:08,848
I don't give a shit
that you're a police officer!

292
00:27:09,250 --> 00:27:11,206
Kill them! Just kill them!

293
00:27:12,090 --> 00:27:13,808
Wait. Wait, Rog.

294
00:27:14,010 --> 00:27:16,365
Come on. You find them and you kill them.

295
00:27:16,650 --> 00:27:19,608
You can do that. You owe me.

296
00:27:23,490 --> 00:27:24,764
I owe you.

297
00:27:26,810 --> 00:27:28,402
Gotta go, man.

298
00:27:35,650 --> 00:27:38,244
What did he mean when he said you owed him?

299
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:40,720
We served together in 1965.

300
00:27:41,090 --> 00:27:44,639
Ia Drang Valley. Saved my life.
Took a bayonet in the lungs.

301
00:27:44,890 --> 00:27:47,450
-That was nice of him.
-I thought so.

302
00:27:47,770 --> 00:27:50,648
-Want me to drive?
-You're supposed to be suicidal.

303
00:27:51,010 --> 00:27:53,524
Anybody who drives
in this town is suicidal.

304
00:27:53,850 --> 00:27:57,684
All units, possible jumper
at Santa Monica and Orlando.

305
00:27:58,050 --> 00:28:00,280
7-A-21, handle code two.

306
00:28:01,690 --> 00:28:04,841
-All units, come in, please.
-Gotcha!

307
00:28:05,290 --> 00:28:07,599
-What's the number of the car?
-3-William-56.

308
00:28:07,850 --> 00:28:11,638
3-William-56 en route.
I love this job! It's so exciting!

309
00:28:11,890 --> 00:28:14,450
Copy.
Police psychologist on the way.

310
00:28:15,970 --> 00:28:18,325
Hey, boss, can we put the sirens on?

311
00:28:32,410 --> 00:28:34,048
Guys, I'm glad you're here.

312
00:28:34,290 --> 00:28:36,599
-Where's the psychologist?
-Stuck in traffic.

313
00:28:36,850 --> 00:28:37,680
Who's this guy?

314
00:28:38,050 --> 00:28:42,168
Name's McCleary. He was at an
office party and just went outside.

315
00:28:42,410 --> 00:28:45,208
-You think he'll go?
-Seems serious enough. Who knows?

316
00:28:46,290 --> 00:28:48,201
-I can handle this.
-Are you qualified?

317
00:28:48,450 --> 00:28:50,486
-I've done it before.
-You're elected.

318
00:28:51,450 --> 00:28:54,248
-No guns, just bring him down.
-Roger.

319
00:28:54,810 --> 00:28:56,084
10-4.

320
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:14,127
-Who are you?
-Riggs, homicide.

321
00:29:14,370 --> 00:29:16,122
He's over there on the ledge.

322
00:29:27,050 --> 00:29:28,403
Merry Christmas.

323
00:29:29,250 --> 00:29:31,286
Leave me alone!

324
00:29:31,690 --> 00:29:32,600
What are you doing?

325
00:29:33,010 --> 00:29:34,363
None of your damn business!

326
00:29:35,090 --> 00:29:36,648
Fair enough.

327
00:29:37,210 --> 00:29:39,849
I'm just going to come out there, okay?

328
00:29:40,050 --> 00:29:42,484
Don't!
You touch me, I'm gonna jump!

329
00:29:44,090 --> 00:29:46,046
Take it easy, for chrissake!

330
00:29:46,330 --> 00:29:48,525
I don't like this any better than you do.

331
00:29:49,290 --> 00:29:51,008
I can't stand heights.

332
00:29:51,250 --> 00:29:52,444
This makes me dizzy.

333
00:29:52,650 --> 00:29:55,005
Just give me a chance to talk to you.

334
00:29:57,650 --> 00:29:59,686
I'm gonna stand on the ledge with you.

335
00:30:00,050 --> 00:30:02,359
Don't go. Not out on the ledge.

336
00:30:03,290 --> 00:30:06,487
You're not the first guy
to think of this, you know.

337
00:30:06,810 --> 00:30:09,529
A lot of people got problems
during this season.

338
00:30:10,210 --> 00:30:12,883
-You know shit!
-No, you're wrong, pal.

339
00:30:13,250 --> 00:30:15,445
You know nothing! Don't touch me!

340
00:30:15,770 --> 00:30:17,249
I didn't do anything wrong!

341
00:30:17,530 --> 00:30:20,328
I know that. It's not like
you're murdering anyone.

342
00:30:20,570 --> 00:30:22,367
-That's right!
-That's right.

343
00:30:22,850 --> 00:30:25,239
The only one I hurt is me! Me!

344
00:30:25,450 --> 00:30:27,964
That's right. I know
you're hurting. I get it.

345
00:30:29,090 --> 00:30:30,648
Don't come near me!

346
00:30:30,930 --> 00:30:33,205
Give me a break.
My boss is watching me.

347
00:30:33,450 --> 00:30:36,044
I got to make it look
like I'm trying to save you.

348
00:30:37,010 --> 00:30:37,806
Come on.

349
00:30:39,370 --> 00:30:42,646
I'm just gonna stand here
and talk to you. That's all.

350
00:30:43,290 --> 00:30:45,645
You won't try nothing?

351
00:30:45,890 --> 00:30:48,040
I'm square with you.
I won't try a thing.

352
00:30:48,490 --> 00:30:52,199
You think I want to fall off?
I promise, I'll just talk to you.

353
00:30:53,610 --> 00:30:54,804
All right.

354
00:30:55,210 --> 00:30:58,600
Here, you want a cigarette?
Come on, let's smoke, okay?

355
00:31:00,010 --> 00:31:00,999
Go on, take it.

356
00:31:01,290 --> 00:31:03,520
Take our time and both die of cancer.

357
00:31:19,130 --> 00:31:20,404
See this key?

358
00:31:20,970 --> 00:31:22,085
Bye-bye!

359
00:31:22,650 --> 00:31:23,639
You're crazy!

360
00:31:23,890 --> 00:31:27,678
You can jump, but you'd take me
with you, making you a murderer.

361
00:31:27,930 --> 00:31:30,000
-You bastard!
-You'd be killing a cop.

362
00:31:30,250 --> 00:31:31,729
Yeah, a psycho nut cop!

363
00:31:31,970 --> 00:31:34,006
I'm still a cop.
You coming in?

364
00:31:34,250 --> 00:31:36,764
-I'm jumping!
-Do you really wanna jump?

365
00:31:36,970 --> 00:31:40,201
Do you wanna?
That's fine with me. Come on!

366
00:31:40,530 --> 00:31:42,088
Let's do it, asshole.

367
00:31:42,290 --> 00:31:43,848
I want to do it.

368
00:31:56,210 --> 00:31:57,438
Shit!

369
00:32:04,610 --> 00:32:06,123
You want to go up again?

370
00:32:06,370 --> 00:32:08,008
Come on, it was great.

371
00:32:10,250 --> 00:32:12,480
Help me! Help me loose!

372
00:32:13,010 --> 00:32:14,568
He's trying to kill me!

373
00:32:14,930 --> 00:32:18,127
Did you see that?
He's out of his mind! He's crazy!

374
00:32:18,410 --> 00:32:20,480
I want my cuffs back.

375
00:32:20,810 --> 00:32:23,688
-Don't you touch me!
-What the fuck did you just do?

376
00:32:24,010 --> 00:32:27,047
I controlled the jump!
You wanted him down? He's down!

377
00:32:27,290 --> 00:32:28,359
Come here!

378
00:32:28,810 --> 00:32:30,289
Come here with me!

379
00:32:41,090 --> 00:32:42,808
Get in here!

380
00:32:46,450 --> 00:32:50,238
Okay, no bullshit!
You want to kill yourself?

381
00:32:50,490 --> 00:32:52,560
Shut up! Yes or no?
You want to die?

382
00:32:53,330 --> 00:32:54,922
I got the job done!

383
00:32:55,250 --> 00:32:57,002
Just answer the question!

384
00:32:57,210 --> 00:32:59,041
What do you want to hear, man?

385
00:32:59,250 --> 00:33:01,764
That sometimes I think about
eating a bullet?

386
00:33:03,050 --> 00:33:04,199
Well, I do!

387
00:33:04,490 --> 00:33:07,527
I got a special one for the occasion,
with a hollow point.

388
00:33:07,890 --> 00:33:11,087
Make sure it blows
the back of my goddamn head out!

389
00:33:11,490 --> 00:33:14,448
Every day I wake up and think
of a reason not to do it.

390
00:33:14,690 --> 00:33:16,806
Every single day.

391
00:33:17,490 --> 00:33:20,641
And you know why I don't?
This is gonna make you laugh.

392
00:33:20,890 --> 00:33:23,848
The job. Doing the job.
That's the reason.

393
00:33:24,370 --> 00:33:27,601
-You want to die!
-I don't. I'm not afraid of it.

394
00:33:28,090 --> 00:33:31,765
Here, take my gun. Don't nibble
on the barrel, pull the trigger.

395
00:33:31,970 --> 00:33:34,279
Be my guest!
Go ahead, if you're serious!

396
00:33:34,650 --> 00:33:36,288
You shouldn't tempt me.

397
00:33:37,090 --> 00:33:40,844
In your mouth. Bullet may go
through your ear and not kill you.

398
00:33:41,090 --> 00:33:43,001
Under the chin's just as good!

399
00:33:59,290 --> 00:34:02,248
You're not trying to draw a psycho pension.

400
00:34:03,890 --> 00:34:05,801
You really are crazy.

401
00:34:10,050 --> 00:34:14,043
I'm hungry. I'm gonna go
and get something to eat.

402
00:34:24,410 --> 00:34:29,325
I don 't know. He's hurting. There's
something eating away at this guy.

403
00:34:29,610 --> 00:34:33,762
I think he's on the edge.
I think Riggs has a death wish.

404
00:34:34,250 --> 00:34:37,765
Terrific. So you're saying I should worry?

405
00:34:39,050 --> 00:34:40,642
I think you should worry.

406
00:34:40,850 --> 00:34:43,080
When he goes,
you don't want to be near him.

407
00:34:43,290 --> 00:34:46,043
Thank you, doctor.
You've been very helpful.

408
00:34:46,450 --> 00:34:47,803
You're welcome.

409
00:34:52,490 --> 00:34:54,799
I'm too old for this shit.

410
00:34:57,450 --> 00:34:58,565
You hungry?

411
00:34:58,850 --> 00:35:00,488
No! I'm not hungry.

412
00:35:01,010 --> 00:35:03,365
-Want me to drive?
-No! I'll drive!

413
00:35:03,690 --> 00:35:04,725
Get in that side!

414
00:35:04,970 --> 00:35:06,198
You drive.

415
00:35:13,010 --> 00:35:17,401
You get a bad personal call? What
is it? Did the stock market crash?

416
00:35:18,010 --> 00:35:20,205
Don't worry. Here, have a French fry.

417
00:35:26,410 --> 00:35:30,403
Fifty years old. What a birthday.
Fifty years old!

418
00:35:30,730 --> 00:35:35,246
Been on the force 20 years, not
a scratch on me. Got a wife, kids...

419
00:35:35,690 --> 00:35:40,366
...house, boat. I can kiss it all
goodbye because of your death wish.

420
00:35:40,570 --> 00:35:41,559
My life is over.

421
00:35:41,770 --> 00:35:43,362
Would you just shut up here!

422
00:35:43,570 --> 00:35:46,403
Why are you talking to me anyway?
I'm a dead man!

423
00:35:48,050 --> 00:35:51,599
I was driving before you were
an itch in your daddy's pants.

424
00:35:56,050 --> 00:35:57,688
-I didn't know that.
-Know what?

425
00:35:57,890 --> 00:35:59,926
That it was your birthday today.

426
00:36:00,810 --> 00:36:02,562
It was yesterday.

427
00:36:03,050 --> 00:36:05,803
Well, happy birthday for yesterday.

428
00:36:08,850 --> 00:36:10,886
Sincerely. Happy birthday, man.

429
00:36:11,090 --> 00:36:12,159
Thanks.

430
00:36:14,730 --> 00:36:18,405
Maybe we'll stay alive long enough
for me to buy you a present.

431
00:36:20,610 --> 00:36:22,248
Don't thank me now.

432
00:36:22,570 --> 00:36:26,404
It's the least I can do after
all the kindness you've shown me.

433
00:36:38,490 --> 00:36:41,004
Are you gonna tell me where we're going?

434
00:36:41,850 --> 00:36:43,124
Are we together on this?

435
00:36:44,210 --> 00:36:48,408
Beverly Hills. We got an address
on Amanda Hunsaker's meal ticket.

436
00:36:48,650 --> 00:36:50,959
Remember, he's not a suspect yet.

437
00:36:51,290 --> 00:36:53,599
So we question him, not damage him.

438
00:36:53,810 --> 00:36:56,244
I won't hurt. You do all the talking.

439
00:36:56,490 --> 00:36:57,843
Let me do all the talking.

440
00:36:58,090 --> 00:36:59,967
Experience counts here.

441
00:37:02,570 --> 00:37:05,448
-You're not going to smoke in the car.
-Well, I am.

442
00:37:06,970 --> 00:37:08,642
What? Does this bother you?

443
00:37:09,010 --> 00:37:09,840
It bothers me.

444
00:37:10,090 --> 00:37:11,603
-Does it?
-Yeah.

445
00:37:13,250 --> 00:37:14,729
I'll open a window.

446
00:37:15,090 --> 00:37:19,800
That's not the point. I have to watch
out for my lungs, take care of myself.

447
00:37:20,490 --> 00:37:22,640
4241 coming up.

448
00:37:22,850 --> 00:37:24,203
Bingo.

449
00:37:25,330 --> 00:37:29,209
-Do we have a warrant?
-We don't need one with the gate club.

450
00:37:29,650 --> 00:37:31,606
Didn't take them long, huh?

451
00:37:35,490 --> 00:37:38,163
Hey, guys, go on in!
Make yourselves at home!

452
00:37:38,530 --> 00:37:39,758
Merry Christmas!

453
00:37:42,170 --> 00:37:44,400
Don't need a warrant with an invitation.

454
00:37:46,090 --> 00:37:49,400
I saw this place on
"Lifestyles of the Rich and Shameless. "

455
00:37:58,890 --> 00:38:00,243
Get the door.

456
00:38:11,690 --> 00:38:13,601
Nice and easy.

457
00:38:16,330 --> 00:38:19,481
-Looks like the Garden of Eden.
-Look at this!

458
00:38:20,770 --> 00:38:22,169
Paradise.

459
00:38:25,290 --> 00:38:26,928
Isn't that sweet?

460
00:38:27,130 --> 00:38:29,405
I'm thinking probable cause.

461
00:38:41,410 --> 00:38:42,968
Get the girls!

462
00:38:44,210 --> 00:38:45,609
Okay, asshole!

463
00:38:46,170 --> 00:38:47,842
Move! Come on! Get out!

464
00:38:48,090 --> 00:38:49,808
Fast! Move!

465
00:38:51,050 --> 00:38:53,689
Get your hands on that tree
and face each other!

466
00:38:54,090 --> 00:38:55,489
Hands in front of you!

467
00:38:55,770 --> 00:38:58,682
-My leg...
-Don't move it, or I'll break your arm.

468
00:38:59,850 --> 00:39:00,680
Got them!

469
00:39:03,810 --> 00:39:05,289
Show me your hands!

470
00:39:05,650 --> 00:39:07,049
Right now!

471
00:39:07,650 --> 00:39:09,402
Put your hands out there!

472
00:39:14,130 --> 00:39:15,358
See how easy that was?

473
00:39:15,610 --> 00:39:18,966
Boom! Still alive.
Now we question him. You know why?

474
00:39:19,290 --> 00:39:22,441
Because I didn't shoot him
or jump off a building with him.

475
00:39:22,650 --> 00:39:24,049
The building guy lived.

476
00:39:24,250 --> 00:39:25,842
The point being, no killing.

477
00:39:26,170 --> 00:39:28,161
-No killing, right.
-Right.

478
00:39:28,370 --> 00:39:30,326
Piece of cake. Now I'm happy.

479
00:39:30,570 --> 00:39:33,130
Read him his rights.
I'll stand here being happy.

480
00:39:35,570 --> 00:39:36,605
He's got a gun!

481
00:40:18,610 --> 00:40:21,124
You ever met anybody you didn't kill?

482
00:40:24,170 --> 00:40:26,400
Well, I haven't killed you yet.

483
00:40:28,690 --> 00:40:30,248
Don't do me no favors.

484
00:40:30,610 --> 00:40:32,089
Don't you worry.

485
00:40:43,570 --> 00:40:47,119
The coroner gave the body a ride downtown.

486
00:40:49,130 --> 00:40:51,041
I guess we can get out of here.

487
00:40:55,890 --> 00:40:58,245
I'm sorry about that shit
I said out there.

488
00:41:00,170 --> 00:41:02,730
You saved my life. Thank you.

489
00:41:08,810 --> 00:41:10,209
I bet that hurt to say.

490
00:41:12,650 --> 00:41:13,844
You'll never know.

491
00:41:15,850 --> 00:41:17,249
Let's get a bite to eat.

492
00:41:17,490 --> 00:41:18,764
Get my shoes on.

493
00:41:29,290 --> 00:41:31,929
-Mom, Rog is coming.
-Okay, Carrie.

494
00:41:40,690 --> 00:41:44,569
Here's my welcoming committee!
Where's my daughter? Which one...?

495
00:41:44,770 --> 00:41:48,001
-Come on, Daddy.
-This one's my daughter!

496
00:41:48,850 --> 00:41:51,045
Home, both of you. Dinnertime.

497
00:41:51,690 --> 00:41:52,964
How are you doing?

498
00:41:53,290 --> 00:41:54,769
I am doing all right.

499
00:41:55,050 --> 00:41:56,688
Is that a crook?

500
00:41:57,130 --> 00:41:59,564
No, this is my new partner, Martin.

501
00:42:03,290 --> 00:42:05,440
I'm glad you're home at a sensible hour.

502
00:42:05,730 --> 00:42:08,324
Well, I try to be a sensible dad.

503
00:42:08,690 --> 00:42:10,248
Come on in, Martin.

504
00:42:11,050 --> 00:42:12,961
Yeah, close the door.

505
00:42:13,530 --> 00:42:17,318
Hello, Nick. Get your legs
off the arm of the couch.

506
00:42:19,010 --> 00:42:22,764
How you doing? Is Mommy
in the kitchen? Let's sneak up on her.

507
00:42:27,810 --> 00:42:30,608
Hello, baby!
I want you to meet...

508
00:42:30,890 --> 00:42:33,563
I'd like you to meet Daddy's new partner.

509
00:42:33,810 --> 00:42:35,323
-Martin Riggs.
-How are you?

510
00:42:35,570 --> 00:42:38,403
-This is my wife, Trish.
-Pleased to meet you.

511
00:42:38,690 --> 00:42:40,726
Martin's going to join us for dinner.

512
00:42:40,970 --> 00:42:43,530
-Roast okay with you?
-What's for dinner?

513
00:42:44,170 --> 00:42:46,400
We'll see what's for dinner.

514
00:42:47,210 --> 00:42:49,929
This is a brown, sticky...

515
00:42:50,410 --> 00:42:51,729
It's roast.

516
00:42:52,010 --> 00:42:54,319
How about a brown, roast-like substance?

517
00:42:54,530 --> 00:42:57,283
-Roger, you're being an asshole.
-I try not to be.

518
00:42:57,610 --> 00:42:59,282
-Want a drink?
-What do you got?

519
00:42:59,490 --> 00:43:01,481
We have Canadian Mist...

520
00:43:02,290 --> 00:43:05,726
-You like Canadian Mist?
-Honey, it's in the back.

521
00:43:07,850 --> 00:43:11,047
How come we didn't have fish?
I thought we had fish tonight.

522
00:43:11,370 --> 00:43:12,883
Don't worry about the fish.

523
00:43:13,130 --> 00:43:15,041
Getting defensive...
Ever go fishing?

524
00:43:15,330 --> 00:43:18,163
Not since I was a kid.
I used to go spearfishing.

525
00:43:20,010 --> 00:43:21,329
All I caught was a cold.

526
00:43:23,690 --> 00:43:25,248
I got that boat out there.

527
00:43:25,570 --> 00:43:27,481
Rianne, get the dessert.

528
00:43:27,850 --> 00:43:30,922
Rianne! Your mother said get the dessert.

529
00:43:31,130 --> 00:43:33,360
-Get the dessert. Get to it!
-Shut up.

530
00:43:34,410 --> 00:43:38,722
Catalina Island. Nothing exciting,
but I catch my allotment.

531
00:43:39,090 --> 00:43:43,288
You can catch a few things out there.
I caught my wife out there.

532
00:43:44,770 --> 00:43:46,328
Nice fishing out there.

533
00:43:46,610 --> 00:43:48,009
Mr. Riggs, care for a tart?

534
00:43:48,530 --> 00:43:50,122
Thank you, yes. Call me Martin.

535
00:43:51,890 --> 00:43:53,482
Mr. Riggs.

536
00:43:53,810 --> 00:43:55,038
Sit down.

537
00:43:56,250 --> 00:43:58,844
Rianne, it's not the first time
we've had company.

538
00:44:04,330 --> 00:44:08,005
My name is Carrie,
I'm no fairy
My sister's cherry

539
00:44:08,330 --> 00:44:10,560
She's in love with a guy named Martin...

540
00:44:11,890 --> 00:44:12,845
Nicholas!

541
00:44:13,050 --> 00:44:15,518
Come on. It was really good!

542
00:44:15,890 --> 00:44:18,085
Yeah, Dad! Why don't you try it?

543
00:44:18,610 --> 00:44:19,486
It was good.

544
00:44:21,970 --> 00:44:23,449
Yeah, there you go.

545
00:44:23,690 --> 00:44:26,045
I'm gonna find a partner
My name is Roger

546
00:44:26,410 --> 00:44:29,846
And I need to be modger
And a secret hodger

547
00:44:30,610 --> 00:44:31,963
You need some help.

548
00:44:32,250 --> 00:44:33,603
I am awful!

549
00:44:47,210 --> 00:44:50,759
Hey, sarge! Thanks for
taking out the garbage.

550
00:44:51,370 --> 00:44:54,089
But, honey, I'm entertaining our guest.

551
00:44:57,570 --> 00:44:58,889
What do you think?

552
00:44:59,570 --> 00:45:02,209
It's nice. You know
anything about boats?

553
00:45:02,450 --> 00:45:05,010
-I know what they cost.
-Can you sail this?

554
00:45:05,530 --> 00:45:08,124
What's wrong with you?
It's not a sailboat.

555
00:45:08,850 --> 00:45:10,078
That's what I thought.

556
00:45:10,410 --> 00:45:15,040
There's no trick. That's the front,
that's the back, water all around.

557
00:45:15,330 --> 00:45:17,890
Why you gotta make things
so complicated?

558
00:45:21,770 --> 00:45:25,399
I don't. Things get complicated
all by themselves.

559
00:45:25,810 --> 00:45:27,960
You mean
Amanda Hunsaker's murder, huh?

560
00:45:28,250 --> 00:45:30,127
Did I mention that? I didn't.

561
00:45:31,210 --> 00:45:33,121
Didn't have to.
I can read your mind.

562
00:45:34,930 --> 00:45:36,966
What's the matter with you?

563
00:45:37,610 --> 00:45:39,760
-Why is there a problem?
-There's no problem.

564
00:45:39,970 --> 00:45:42,086
You got one dead girl
and one dead guy.

565
00:45:42,330 --> 00:45:46,562
The guy kills the girl. We kill him
because he wants us to be dead guys.

566
00:45:46,970 --> 00:45:48,608
That's easy for you to say.

567
00:45:49,930 --> 00:45:51,761
A sugar daddy is dealing drugs.

568
00:45:51,970 --> 00:45:55,360
She said, did or saw something
she wasn't supposed to.

569
00:45:55,570 --> 00:45:58,721
He pitches her off the balcony
into the sweet by-and-by.

570
00:45:59,770 --> 00:46:01,965
That's why he came at us
with a shotgun today.

571
00:46:02,170 --> 00:46:06,083
I'm sorry. It's just a little too neat.
I can't swallow it.

572
00:46:06,410 --> 00:46:10,198
Of course it's neat.
What's wrong with neat? I like neat.

573
00:46:11,530 --> 00:46:13,805
By neat, you mean simple.

574
00:46:16,330 --> 00:46:17,922
-You okay?
-Watch out!

575
00:46:18,570 --> 00:46:20,003
What button did you push?

576
00:46:21,130 --> 00:46:22,768
Where's my manual?

577
00:46:24,170 --> 00:46:26,365
Is this what you're looking for, captain?

578
00:46:26,610 --> 00:46:27,838
You asshole!

579
00:46:28,650 --> 00:46:32,325
Didn't mean to interrupt one of those
intellectual conversations...

580
00:46:33,130 --> 00:46:35,325
Mark asked me to a club tomorrow night.

581
00:46:35,610 --> 00:46:38,568
-You're grounded. You know that.
-Please, Daddy?

582
00:46:38,770 --> 00:46:39,839
Which one is Mark?

583
00:46:40,090 --> 00:46:42,365
-The blond one.
-With pits in his face?

584
00:46:42,890 --> 00:46:44,209
Those are dimples.

585
00:46:44,410 --> 00:46:48,244
Pits. When he smiles, I can see
through his head. The answer is no.

586
00:46:48,810 --> 00:46:49,959
Have a heart, Rog.

587
00:46:50,170 --> 00:46:53,560
Hey, buddy. She smoked pot
in the house. She's grounded.

588
00:46:53,770 --> 00:46:57,365
Why can I have a beer
and I can't smoke a joint?

589
00:46:57,570 --> 00:46:58,798
It's not coke, you know.

590
00:46:59,010 --> 00:47:02,719
I'll tell you why.
Because now, at this moment...

591
00:47:03,050 --> 00:47:06,087
...beer is legal, grass ain't.
Right or wrong?

592
00:47:06,490 --> 00:47:07,286
It's wrong.

593
00:47:07,650 --> 00:47:08,446
Right.

594
00:47:14,330 --> 00:47:17,049
They sit there drinking six-packs
and I get grounded.

595
00:47:18,530 --> 00:47:20,122
I'm gonna go home.

596
00:47:20,810 --> 00:47:23,119
Did we resolve anything here tonight?

597
00:47:23,330 --> 00:47:25,161
Yeah, we resolved plenty.

598
00:47:26,290 --> 00:47:28,599
We know your wife takes out the garbage...

599
00:47:28,930 --> 00:47:31,490
...your daughter smokes grass
and it's illegal...

600
00:47:32,810 --> 00:47:35,529
...and you don't know a lot about boats.

601
00:47:39,730 --> 00:47:42,039
You got a hell of a nice family there.

602
00:47:42,290 --> 00:47:43,325
Thank you.

603
00:47:44,130 --> 00:47:46,086
I enjoyed the meal. Thanks a lot.

604
00:47:46,290 --> 00:47:49,441
Bullshit. But thanks anyway.

605
00:47:55,490 --> 00:47:57,242
You don't trust me at all, do you?

606
00:47:58,610 --> 00:48:03,206
I tell you what. You make it through
tomorrow without killing anybody...

607
00:48:03,410 --> 00:48:07,198
...especially me or yourself,
then I'll start trusting you.

608
00:48:09,410 --> 00:48:10,729
Fair enough.

609
00:48:15,650 --> 00:48:17,049
I do it real good, you know.

610
00:48:17,690 --> 00:48:18,520
Do what?

611
00:48:21,730 --> 00:48:25,769
When I was 19, I did a guy
in Laos from 1000 yards out.

612
00:48:26,210 --> 00:48:28,326
A rifle shot in high wind.

613
00:48:30,690 --> 00:48:32,123
Maybe eight...

614
00:48:32,650 --> 00:48:35,687
...or even ten guys in the world
could have made that shot.

615
00:48:40,050 --> 00:48:42,518
It's the only thing I was ever good at.

616
00:48:45,010 --> 00:48:46,079
See you tomorrow.

617
00:48:47,930 --> 00:48:49,522
Yeah, see you.

618
00:48:56,170 --> 00:48:58,126
You really like my wife's cooking?

619
00:49:04,450 --> 00:49:05,405
No.

620
00:49:06,530 --> 00:49:07,724
See you tomorrow.

621
00:49:32,130 --> 00:49:34,041
Get out of there, Burbank.

622
00:49:52,890 --> 00:49:54,721
This is cute.

623
00:49:58,370 --> 00:50:00,930
What have we got here?
"Police evidence. "

624
00:51:34,890 --> 00:51:37,404
Morning, Roger.
Here, have some coffee.

625
00:51:37,930 --> 00:51:42,526
I've been doing a lot of thinking
about the night Amanda Hunsaker died.

626
00:51:42,850 --> 00:51:44,602
-How did you get in?
-Trish let me in.

627
00:51:44,850 --> 00:51:46,727
-What time is it?
-Daytime.

628
00:51:47,170 --> 00:51:49,730
The night Amanda Hunsaker died, she...

629
00:51:50,210 --> 00:51:53,088
What was the name of that hooker
who witnessed the jump?

630
00:51:53,290 --> 00:51:56,646
Come on, we got to get up
and catch bad guys today.

631
00:51:56,930 --> 00:51:58,363
I'll get a shower.

632
00:51:58,650 --> 00:52:01,289
What was the name of that hooker?

633
00:52:01,490 --> 00:52:04,721
-Century City isn't her usual turf.
-Her name is Dixie!

634
00:52:04,930 --> 00:52:08,605
Give me that cup.
And get out of here!

635
00:52:12,770 --> 00:52:15,682
Someone was in bed with Amanda
the night she died.

636
00:52:15,970 --> 00:52:18,040
Until now, we assumed it was a man.

637
00:52:18,370 --> 00:52:19,962
Suppose it was Dixie.

638
00:52:20,210 --> 00:52:24,249
Disgusting, but okay. Let's say Dixie
put the drain cleaner in her pills.

639
00:52:24,450 --> 00:52:25,883
Say someone paid her.

640
00:52:26,090 --> 00:52:30,766
She thinks, "Amanda swallows a couple
downers and she's dead". Then Dixie...

641
00:52:31,210 --> 00:52:32,006
If it was her.

642
00:52:32,410 --> 00:52:37,325
If it was her. She's got plenty of time
to spritz the place up and get out.

643
00:52:37,530 --> 00:52:39,486
But Amanda jumps out the window.

644
00:52:39,810 --> 00:52:41,607
Or Dixie pushes her.

645
00:52:41,810 --> 00:52:44,643
She has to make a quick exit
because the body's public.

646
00:52:44,850 --> 00:52:46,329
So she hauls ass downstairs.

647
00:52:46,530 --> 00:52:48,441
People are saying, "What happened?"

648
00:52:48,690 --> 00:52:50,965
Somebody spots her,
and she says, "Shit!"

649
00:52:51,330 --> 00:52:53,366
That's right, she says, "Shit!"

650
00:52:53,610 --> 00:52:56,488
The point being that now
she has to cover her ass.

651
00:52:58,370 --> 00:53:02,841
So she grabs a flatfoot and says,
"Officer, I saw the whole thing".

652
00:53:04,130 --> 00:53:05,404
Right.

653
00:53:09,090 --> 00:53:10,648
That's pretty fucking thin.

654
00:53:10,850 --> 00:53:12,044
That's very thin.

655
00:53:12,370 --> 00:53:13,962
Thin's my middle name.

656
00:53:14,210 --> 00:53:16,519
Your wife's cooking, I'm not surprised.

657
00:53:17,890 --> 00:53:19,403
-What?
-Nothing.

658
00:53:19,730 --> 00:53:22,369
Those remarks won't get you
invited to Christmas dinner.

659
00:53:23,410 --> 00:53:26,004
My luck's changing for the better every day.

660
00:53:28,130 --> 00:53:30,519
All right, baby, come to Roger.

661
00:53:32,770 --> 00:53:34,203
Center mass.

662
00:53:40,130 --> 00:53:41,927
Read them and weep.

663
00:53:45,090 --> 00:53:47,206
Do you sleep with that thing?

664
00:53:47,690 --> 00:53:49,169
I would if I slept.

665
00:53:49,490 --> 00:53:52,527
Step back. Let me show
what an old man can do.

666
00:53:53,410 --> 00:53:55,526
Just warming up,
just warming up.

667
00:54:02,850 --> 00:54:04,363
Watch carefully.

668
00:54:17,410 --> 00:54:20,766
Hey! Look at that, will you?
Not bad for an old man.

669
00:54:21,250 --> 00:54:23,320
Step aside, old man.

670
00:55:17,210 --> 00:55:18,928
Have a nice day.

671
00:55:24,410 --> 00:55:25,763
Shit!

672
00:55:29,210 --> 00:55:31,770
Uh-oh! The policemen are here!

673
00:55:32,410 --> 00:55:35,607
Yeah, you're right.
Hello, policemen!

674
00:55:40,570 --> 00:55:42,401
-How you doing?
-Fine.

675
00:55:42,610 --> 00:55:45,170
Are you going to bust Dixie?

676
00:55:45,410 --> 00:55:48,083
We're just going over there
for a cup of coffee.

677
00:55:48,290 --> 00:55:50,360
We're going over here to have breakfast.

678
00:55:50,610 --> 00:55:52,760
You're gonna bust Dixie!

679
00:55:52,970 --> 00:55:55,359
You're gonna bust Dixie!

680
00:56:00,530 --> 00:56:03,567
-Like I said, thin.
-Probably nothing.

681
00:56:16,010 --> 00:56:18,319
Did you see that? Wasn't that great?

682
00:56:21,850 --> 00:56:23,283
What are you, a fag?

683
00:56:23,490 --> 00:56:25,128
Your coat's on fire!

684
00:56:29,330 --> 00:56:32,527
-Probably nothing.
-Thin. Very thin.

685
00:56:34,650 --> 00:56:37,323
You guys okay?
Got all your fingers and toes?

686
00:56:37,570 --> 00:56:39,606
Three William 56.

687
00:56:39,890 --> 00:56:42,688
We got a fire and explosion
at 111th and Larch.

688
00:56:42,970 --> 00:56:45,723
Request ambulance and fire department.

689
00:56:46,170 --> 00:56:48,400
Do it again! Do it again!

690
00:56:48,730 --> 00:56:51,483
-Give me a break, guys.
-Enough, enough!

691
00:56:51,770 --> 00:56:53,920
Do you think Dixie was home?

692
00:57:04,530 --> 00:57:05,849
What you got?

693
00:57:07,010 --> 00:57:08,329
Part of the device.

694
00:57:08,610 --> 00:57:10,965
This is artwork.
This is goddamn artwork.

695
00:57:11,170 --> 00:57:16,085
This is real pro stuff. I haven't seen
anything like this since the war.

696
00:57:17,490 --> 00:57:20,721
The CIA used to hire mercs.
They used the exact same setup.

697
00:57:20,970 --> 00:57:23,768
Mercury switches, gaflooey!
That's heavy shit.

698
00:57:25,290 --> 00:57:28,123
We got something.
The detective wants to see you.

699
00:57:37,890 --> 00:57:38,925
Okay, here it is.

700
00:57:39,170 --> 00:57:40,842
Some kids playing this morning...

701
00:57:41,050 --> 00:57:43,086
...one saw a guy checking the meter.

702
00:57:43,330 --> 00:57:45,366
-Where?
-Here at Dixie's.

703
00:57:45,610 --> 00:57:49,762
He was playing under the porch.
Says he saw the guy pretty good.

704
00:57:50,010 --> 00:57:53,320
-It could be a break.
-Those kids are six years old.

705
00:57:53,530 --> 00:57:55,919
-You call the gas company?
-Sure did.

706
00:57:56,250 --> 00:57:59,720
No one's supposed to check
that meter for at least a month.

707
00:58:01,050 --> 00:58:03,962
-Let me handle this.
-Be my guest.

708
00:58:04,170 --> 00:58:06,525
He's the little fellow that saw the guy.

709
00:58:07,490 --> 00:58:10,368
My name is Detective Murtaugh.
What's yours?

710
00:58:10,570 --> 00:58:13,767
-Don't tell him your name.
-He'll put you in jail.

711
00:58:14,010 --> 00:58:15,204
You won't see your mom.

712
00:58:15,490 --> 00:58:19,165
It's all right. I won't put you in jail.
What's your name?

713
00:58:19,370 --> 00:58:22,362
-Don't tell him, Alfred.
-Alfred!

714
00:58:22,810 --> 00:58:26,007
This is Alfred! Hey, meet Alfred.
This is Alfred.

715
00:58:26,250 --> 00:58:28,764
Alfred, hi! How old are you?

716
00:58:29,130 --> 00:58:30,245
Six.

717
00:58:30,610 --> 00:58:34,080
Six years old. I bet you like Go-Bots.

718
00:58:34,290 --> 00:58:35,643
Is that a real gun?

719
00:58:36,090 --> 00:58:37,967
Yeah, this is a real gun.

720
00:58:38,410 --> 00:58:39,525
Do you kill people?

721
00:58:39,810 --> 00:58:43,928
No. If some guy is hurting someone,
I try to shoot him in the leg...

722
00:58:44,170 --> 00:58:45,489
...just to stop him.

723
00:58:45,690 --> 00:58:48,124
Mama says policemen shoot black people.

724
00:58:48,370 --> 00:58:50,201
-Is it true?
-Yeah, is it true?

725
00:58:50,410 --> 00:58:52,128
Is that true?

726
00:58:54,650 --> 00:58:56,800
Maybe we ought to get the kids some...

727
00:58:57,210 --> 00:58:58,325
Ice cream.

728
00:58:58,770 --> 00:58:59,759
You like ice cream?

729
00:59:06,010 --> 00:59:08,524
No, not you, Alfred.

730
00:59:12,570 --> 00:59:15,767
The man you saw,
did you get a good look at him?

731
00:59:16,010 --> 00:59:18,205
-I saw him.
-Great!

732
00:59:18,850 --> 00:59:22,923
Picture him in your head.
Close your eyes.

733
00:59:23,490 --> 00:59:25,640
Think what he looks like.

734
00:59:25,970 --> 00:59:27,039
Got it?

735
00:59:27,490 --> 00:59:28,889
Can you draw him?

736
00:59:30,330 --> 00:59:33,208
Give me some drawing paper and crayons.

737
00:59:33,650 --> 00:59:35,845
-This is good.
-Can it, man.

738
00:59:36,090 --> 00:59:38,320
We're gonna put out an APB on Big Bird.

739
00:59:38,690 --> 00:59:41,363
"All units. Large yellow bird, silly voice."

740
00:59:41,730 --> 00:59:44,449
You're hilarious, Martin. It's enough.

741
00:59:44,650 --> 00:59:46,322
Tell me what he looks like.

742
00:59:47,490 --> 00:59:48,525
Was he black?

743
00:59:49,690 --> 00:59:50,679
Was he white?

744
00:59:53,570 --> 00:59:54,366
Was he tall?

745
00:59:55,690 --> 00:59:57,169
Tall like me?

746
00:59:57,370 --> 00:59:59,361
What color was his hair? Brown?

747
01:00:00,570 --> 01:00:01,969
Black?

748
01:00:02,490 --> 01:00:03,889
Blond?

749
01:00:04,090 --> 01:00:05,523
His hair was blond.

750
01:00:06,610 --> 01:00:09,886
What did he have on?
Did he have jeans on?

751
01:00:10,090 --> 01:00:11,284
It was paint.

752
01:00:11,530 --> 01:00:12,724
Pained?

753
01:00:13,370 --> 01:00:14,325
I don't know.

754
01:00:16,850 --> 01:00:17,646
Painted?

755
01:00:18,930 --> 01:00:20,727
Painted. A tattoo?

756
01:00:22,290 --> 01:00:25,441
Like Popeye?
A tattoo like Popeye? No?

757
01:00:26,490 --> 01:00:27,605
It was that.

758
01:00:30,010 --> 01:00:31,409
Like that?

759
01:00:32,050 --> 01:00:33,483
Exactly like that?

760
01:00:35,090 --> 01:00:37,285
I saw it good. This is it.

761
01:00:37,490 --> 01:00:38,809
I remember.

762
01:00:39,250 --> 01:00:40,478
Are you sure?

763
01:00:41,010 --> 01:00:42,238
It had a knife, even.

764
01:00:53,330 --> 01:00:56,208
Roger, that's a Special Forces tattoo.

765
01:00:57,010 --> 01:00:58,125
Really?

766
01:00:59,770 --> 01:01:03,080
A Special Forces tattoo, mercury switches...

767
01:01:06,930 --> 01:01:09,398
What the hell have we gotten into here?

768
01:01:12,210 --> 01:01:15,407
Wonder if there's an opening
in the fire department?

769
01:01:25,210 --> 01:01:26,325
Want to tell me about it?

770
01:01:26,810 --> 01:01:29,085
-About what?
-Don't bullshit me.

771
01:01:29,330 --> 01:01:32,606
Your daughter wasn't killed
for something she was into.

772
01:01:32,850 --> 01:01:34,966
She was killed for something you're into.

773
01:01:36,650 --> 01:01:37,799
Stop me if I'm wrong.

774
01:01:39,090 --> 01:01:41,046
I don't know what you mean.

775
01:01:42,170 --> 01:01:45,003
Keep your hands away from your pocket, okay?

776
01:01:45,610 --> 01:01:46,406
Easy, man.

777
01:01:46,610 --> 01:01:47,406
Fuck easy.

778
01:01:50,330 --> 01:01:53,606
You called me the other day
to blow the whistle, right?

779
01:01:54,290 --> 01:01:55,803
Blow the whistle on what?

780
01:01:56,010 --> 01:01:59,161
You were going to tell all,
so they killed your daughter.

781
01:01:59,410 --> 01:02:01,970
Tell me if I'm wrong.
Talk to me!

782
01:02:02,290 --> 01:02:04,360
They killed your daughter.

783
01:02:04,650 --> 01:02:07,608
They paid off a hooker to poison
your little girl.

784
01:02:07,850 --> 01:02:09,806
Chrissake!
I've got another daughter.

785
01:02:10,050 --> 01:02:13,201
-She'll be protected.
-You don't know these people.

786
01:02:13,690 --> 01:02:15,408
Acquaint me with them.

787
01:02:18,810 --> 01:02:20,448
It goes back to the war.

788
01:02:23,530 --> 01:02:27,603
I worked with a group called
"Air America." CIA front.

789
01:02:29,810 --> 01:02:32,324
They secretly ran
the entire war out of Laos.

790
01:02:33,010 --> 01:02:37,003
I was with a special unit called
"Shadow Company." Trained killers.

791
01:02:37,330 --> 01:02:40,686
When Charlie brought in heroin
to finance the VC government...

792
01:02:40,930 --> 01:02:43,603
...Shadow Company burned
the whole thing down.

793
01:02:44,050 --> 01:02:45,802
We killed everybody.

794
01:02:50,650 --> 01:02:52,322
We also formed a plan.

795
01:02:52,730 --> 01:02:53,799
Keep talking.

796
01:02:59,770 --> 01:03:03,001
A few years ago, Shadow Company
got together again.

797
01:03:03,410 --> 01:03:05,002
The war was over.

798
01:03:05,970 --> 01:03:08,484
But we still had our sources in Asia.

799
01:03:09,690 --> 01:03:11,646
We've been bringing it in ever since.

800
01:03:12,010 --> 01:03:13,238
Bringing in what?

801
01:03:14,290 --> 01:03:15,609
Heroin.

802
01:03:16,050 --> 01:03:18,200
Two major shipments a year.

803
01:03:21,490 --> 01:03:23,765
It's all run by ex-CIA.

804
01:03:24,530 --> 01:03:26,441
Soldiers, mercs.

805
01:03:27,250 --> 01:03:29,241
You son of a bitch!

806
01:03:29,450 --> 01:03:33,204
If you had cold feet, why did
they kill Amanda? Why not you?

807
01:03:33,410 --> 01:03:35,719
-They can't. They need me.
-Why?

808
01:03:35,970 --> 01:03:40,805
My company is a perfect front. Makes
everything look great on tax reports.

809
01:03:44,370 --> 01:03:46,600
This is big business, Roger.

810
01:03:51,250 --> 01:03:52,729
Not anymore.

811
01:03:53,810 --> 01:03:55,721
I'm gonna burn it down.

812
01:03:55,930 --> 01:03:57,682
You can't. It's too big.

813
01:03:58,250 --> 01:04:01,128
These people are trained,
expert killers.

814
01:04:01,610 --> 01:04:05,569
Tell me about your next shipment:
Where it's coming in, how many...

815
01:04:05,770 --> 01:04:08,364
I can't tell you that, Roger.
I can't.

816
01:04:09,010 --> 01:04:13,447
I have another daughter. You can't
protect her. I'm in this too deep.

817
01:04:31,930 --> 01:04:35,400
Heroin.
You got off easy, you son of a bitch!

818
01:04:55,250 --> 01:04:56,365
You through?

819
01:04:56,730 --> 01:04:58,448
I haven't even started.

820
01:04:58,930 --> 01:05:03,082
Gen. McAllister, this is Delta One.
We're coming in. Over.

821
01:05:03,770 --> 01:05:06,079
-So your mission is accomplished?
-Yes, sir.

822
01:05:06,330 --> 01:05:08,400
Mr. Hunsaker is dead, sir.

823
01:05:08,690 --> 01:05:11,443
I'm afraid, however,
that another problem exists.

824
01:05:11,690 --> 01:05:13,203
What is it? Explain.

825
01:05:13,450 --> 01:05:15,361
Hunsaker spoke to the police.

826
01:05:15,650 --> 01:05:18,801
-Are they dead?
-No, I missed the opportunity.

827
01:05:19,050 --> 01:05:22,759
Very disappointing. So the police
may know the whole operation?

828
01:05:22,970 --> 01:05:24,562
That is correct, sir.

829
01:05:25,170 --> 01:05:27,445
Joshua, it's time we turned up the heat.

830
01:05:27,690 --> 01:05:29,043
Come on home.

831
01:05:46,610 --> 01:05:49,408
What's a nice Irish girl
like you doing out here?

832
01:05:49,610 --> 01:05:52,568
I'm looking for a guy,
had this girl in his stable.

833
01:05:52,770 --> 01:05:55,728
-Never seen her.
-She's in your line of work. You sure?

834
01:05:56,010 --> 01:05:58,399
-Sure. Why?
-I'm a police officer.

835
01:05:58,610 --> 01:06:01,170
Don't worry, I won't drag your
ass to jail...

836
01:06:27,570 --> 01:06:28,889
You wore your vest!

837
01:06:29,930 --> 01:06:32,160
That was smart, kid. Come on.

838
01:06:34,290 --> 01:06:36,520
Hold on! I'm on your side.

839
01:06:39,090 --> 01:06:41,399
Son of a bitch, that hurts!

840
01:06:42,050 --> 01:06:44,405
I'm pissed, Roger! Now I'm pissed.

841
01:06:46,170 --> 01:06:47,523
Look at your face!

842
01:06:47,850 --> 01:06:49,886
Two inches higher,
he'd have hit your head.

843
01:06:50,090 --> 01:06:52,558
Two inches lower,
I'd be a falsetto for life.

844
01:06:52,770 --> 01:06:54,601
I bet you'd sound nice too.

845
01:06:56,290 --> 01:06:58,201
-Where's my gun?
-Here.

846
01:07:01,170 --> 01:07:02,808
Oh, shit! Roger!

847
01:07:03,610 --> 01:07:05,566
The guy who shot me...

848
01:07:06,210 --> 01:07:09,566
The same albino jackrabbit
son of a bitch that did Hunsaker.

849
01:07:09,770 --> 01:07:10,566
You sure?

850
01:07:10,970 --> 01:07:13,438
I'm sure, man.
I never forget an asshole.

851
01:07:13,690 --> 01:07:15,282
I got an idea.

852
01:07:16,010 --> 01:07:19,480
We fly first class to Detroit
and lay low for a couple weeks.

853
01:07:19,690 --> 01:07:21,965
Come on, be serious.
What do we do?

854
01:07:22,170 --> 01:07:23,239
What else?

855
01:07:23,490 --> 01:07:26,050
We bury the fuckers.
And you know what else?

856
01:07:26,250 --> 01:07:30,209
We do this right, we get famous.
Do shaving ads. Girls. Money.

857
01:07:30,970 --> 01:07:33,530
With our luck, we'll do
Forest Lawn commercials.

858
01:07:33,730 --> 01:07:35,925
Bullshit! We got the edge.

859
01:07:36,970 --> 01:07:40,440
Roger, they think I'm dead.
I'm a corpse.

860
01:07:46,450 --> 01:07:47,803
Brilliant.

861
01:07:49,770 --> 01:07:51,442
Brilliant shit!

862
01:07:54,290 --> 01:07:55,928
We got a body for you.

863
01:07:56,170 --> 01:07:59,560
He was at Hunsaker's place.
I saw him, he saw me.

864
01:07:59,770 --> 01:08:01,681
Get someone else to do it, okay?

865
01:08:02,010 --> 01:08:05,969
Captain says give it to you.
About two blocks from your house.

866
01:08:06,450 --> 01:08:09,999
Yeah, sure. He's probably blond
with big dimples.

867
01:08:10,330 --> 01:08:12,560
How did you know that, sarge?

868
01:08:14,370 --> 01:08:15,246
Get in here!

869
01:08:16,690 --> 01:08:17,679
Trouble.

870
01:08:20,890 --> 01:08:24,599
They just gave a description
of the kid my daughter's dating.

871
01:08:50,970 --> 01:08:53,040
Let's be dark and quiet.

872
01:09:32,690 --> 01:09:34,806
The bastards got my daughter.

873
01:09:45,810 --> 01:09:46,720
What is it?

874
01:09:47,450 --> 01:09:48,246
Nothing.

875
01:09:48,450 --> 01:09:49,929
-What is it?!
-Nothing!

876
01:09:50,170 --> 01:09:52,809
Get back in your room.
Back in your room!

877
01:10:09,410 --> 01:10:11,287
You have a beautiful daughter.

878
01:10:11,490 --> 01:10:14,800
I'd stick by the phone to find out
where to meet us.

879
01:10:20,570 --> 01:10:22,242
They got my kid.

880
01:10:23,930 --> 01:10:25,921
Bastards took my baby.

881
01:10:48,450 --> 01:10:50,964
Sgt. McCaskey, pick up line three.

882
01:10:51,770 --> 01:10:53,442
Homicide, McCaskey speaking.

883
01:10:53,650 --> 01:10:54,924
This is KCOP news.

884
01:10:55,130 --> 01:10:59,328
We heard an officer was shot tonight.
Can you give us more information?

885
01:10:59,570 --> 01:11:03,165
Sgt. Martin Riggs was shot and killed.
Who is this?

886
01:11:03,370 --> 01:11:05,247
We'll send somebody right over.

887
01:11:09,570 --> 01:11:12,004
Bingo! Riggs is out of the picture.

888
01:11:12,410 --> 01:11:14,082
I want Murtaugh taken alive.

889
01:11:14,610 --> 01:11:16,009
He may not talk.

890
01:11:17,210 --> 01:11:19,041
We have his little girl.
He'll talk.

891
01:11:34,490 --> 01:11:37,209
You know they're gonna kill her, don't you?

892
01:11:40,370 --> 01:11:44,602
And if you want her back,
you'll have to take her away from them.

893
01:11:44,930 --> 01:11:46,158
I know.

894
01:11:51,370 --> 01:11:55,124
We do this my way.
You shoot and you shoot to kill.

895
01:11:55,610 --> 01:11:59,888
Get as many as you can.
All you got to do is just not miss.

896
01:12:00,090 --> 01:12:01,569
I won't miss.

897
01:12:03,490 --> 01:12:06,288
We're going to get bloody on this one.

898
01:12:10,290 --> 01:12:11,928
Are you really crazy?

899
01:12:14,570 --> 01:12:16,765
Or are you as good as you say you are?

900
01:12:18,810 --> 01:12:20,607
You're gonna have to trust me.

901
01:12:24,450 --> 01:12:25,724
Here we go.

902
01:12:32,170 --> 01:12:36,243
We don 't want your daughter.
We want to know what Hunsaker told you.

903
01:12:36,450 --> 01:12:40,329
Dry lake. Victorville.
Sunrise tomorrow. Be there.

904
01:15:37,610 --> 01:15:38,884
Murtaugh!

905
01:15:39,490 --> 01:15:40,843
Yes, that's right.

906
01:15:41,090 --> 01:15:42,967
Show me my daughter!

907
01:15:43,290 --> 01:15:46,009
Let me see her, then I'll come quietly.

908
01:15:52,690 --> 01:15:54,282
He wants to see the girl.

909
01:15:54,490 --> 01:15:55,684
Get out.

910
01:16:00,970 --> 01:16:02,164
Daddy!

911
01:16:02,650 --> 01:16:04,880
Okay, baby! I'm here.

912
01:16:05,370 --> 01:16:07,201
Okay, it's all right.

913
01:16:07,450 --> 01:16:08,360
Simple exchange.

914
01:16:09,370 --> 01:16:12,806
You come with us,
the girl takes a walk.

915
01:16:13,050 --> 01:16:14,449
Let her go now.

916
01:16:16,610 --> 01:16:20,046
As I say, take your hands
out of your pockets.

917
01:16:20,250 --> 01:16:21,842
Sure thing, pal.

918
01:16:25,530 --> 01:16:26,485
It's alive.

919
01:16:28,890 --> 01:16:31,404
Let her go now, or we all die.

920
01:16:32,210 --> 01:16:33,245
Take him!

921
01:16:33,570 --> 01:16:34,764
He has a grenade!

922
01:16:35,010 --> 01:16:37,843
He's bluffing!
He wouldn't risk killing his daughter.

923
01:16:38,610 --> 01:16:40,089
If she's gonna die...

924
01:16:40,330 --> 01:16:43,606
. . .she's gonna die with me.
My way, not yours.

925
01:16:48,570 --> 01:16:52,768
Come on, Roger, get out of the way.
Move to your left. Come on!

926
01:16:53,010 --> 01:16:54,409
Put the pin back in.

927
01:16:54,890 --> 01:16:58,565
Officer Murtaugh, don't be foolish.
Look at the hardware.

928
01:16:58,890 --> 01:17:00,448
Move to your left.

929
01:17:05,890 --> 01:17:09,246
Look at the firepower.
You're grounded. Riggs is gone.

930
01:17:09,610 --> 01:17:11,680
Put the pin back in the grenade.

931
01:17:11,890 --> 01:17:13,403
If you come closer...

932
01:17:13,890 --> 01:17:15,118
...then we all die.

933
01:17:16,610 --> 01:17:18,202
I don't think so.

934
01:17:25,890 --> 01:17:27,608
Come on, honey.

935
01:17:29,610 --> 01:17:30,565
Just a smoker.

936
01:17:30,810 --> 01:17:31,606
Bingo.

937
01:17:36,930 --> 01:17:37,760
Where is he?

938
01:17:37,970 --> 01:17:38,766
It's Riggs.

939
01:17:41,090 --> 01:17:43,320
Rianne, get in the car!

940
01:17:44,930 --> 01:17:46,568
Get in the fucking car!

941
01:18:03,810 --> 01:18:05,243
Go, Rianne, go!

942
01:18:05,570 --> 01:18:08,209
Come on, cottontail, stick your head up.

943
01:18:09,610 --> 01:18:11,999
That's it, you son of a bitch.
Good night.

944
01:18:15,530 --> 01:18:18,124
Don't try it, son.
You're not that fast.

945
01:18:20,050 --> 01:18:21,802
Hello, Joshua. Hello, Joshua.

946
01:18:22,010 --> 01:18:23,682
-Yes, sir.
-I got Riggs.

947
01:18:24,450 --> 01:18:27,044
He's got Riggs. Go get the girl!

948
01:19:01,010 --> 01:19:02,921
Throw your weapon down!

949
01:19:03,170 --> 01:19:05,400
Put your hands behind your head!

950
01:19:09,330 --> 01:19:12,845
You're Gen. Peter McAllister,
commander of Shadow Company.

951
01:19:13,250 --> 01:19:15,810
I see we've heard of each other.

952
01:19:16,010 --> 01:19:19,400
Yep. It'll almost be a shame
when I nail you.

953
01:19:20,290 --> 01:19:24,442
I ran into some of those Shadow Company
pussies in Saigon in '69.

954
01:19:24,730 --> 01:19:25,958
You did, did you?

955
01:20:11,170 --> 01:20:12,922
Leave me alone!

956
01:20:38,570 --> 01:20:40,765
Save your strength.
You'll need it.

957
01:20:41,170 --> 01:20:42,080
Who's the Chin?

958
01:20:43,250 --> 01:20:45,718
Endo, meet Mr. Martin Riggs.

959
01:20:46,810 --> 01:20:49,643
Endo has forgotten more
about dispensing pain...

960
01:20:49,850 --> 01:20:51,044
...than we'll ever know.

961
01:20:52,850 --> 01:20:54,522
See, we have a problem.

962
01:20:54,730 --> 01:20:56,448
Since we have Murtaugh...

963
01:20:56,970 --> 01:20:58,198
...we don't need you.

964
01:20:58,530 --> 01:21:01,761
-I believe in being thorough.
-I've heard that about you.

965
01:21:03,890 --> 01:21:06,450
Our problem, and yours too...

966
01:21:07,170 --> 01:21:10,048
...is we have a shipment
of merchandise to deliver.

967
01:21:10,250 --> 01:21:12,047
Why don't you just call it heroin?

968
01:21:13,650 --> 01:21:15,925
It's rather large, this shipment.

969
01:21:16,850 --> 01:21:18,681
It would be unfortunate...

970
01:21:18,890 --> 01:21:21,529
...if we showed up
to deliver our heroin...

971
01:21:22,170 --> 01:21:23,842
...and were surrounded by 50 cops.

972
01:21:24,050 --> 01:21:25,199
That would be too bad.

973
01:21:25,450 --> 01:21:26,929
Yes, it would be.

974
01:21:27,850 --> 01:21:30,648
So we have to find out all the cops know.

975
01:21:30,850 --> 01:21:33,683
We don't know shit.
You did Hunsaker before he could say...

976
01:21:35,970 --> 01:21:39,360
I wish I could believe you.
Unfortunately, I don't.

977
01:21:44,290 --> 01:21:47,043
Now, if you tell me everything you know...

978
01:21:47,290 --> 01:21:49,485
...I promise you I'll kill you quick.

979
01:21:51,570 --> 01:21:53,242
I told you everything I know.

980
01:22:00,130 --> 01:22:01,609
What is that thing?

981
01:22:03,450 --> 01:22:04,769
I'll tell you.

982
01:22:05,690 --> 01:22:07,646
It's electric shock treatment.

983
01:22:09,570 --> 01:22:12,528
We're in for a long night,
because I don't know shit.

984
01:22:14,770 --> 01:22:16,089
We'll see.

985
01:22:24,490 --> 01:22:25,366
Hit him again!

986
01:22:35,090 --> 01:22:35,886
Again!

987
01:22:41,090 --> 01:22:42,569
Tell me about the shipment!

988
01:22:44,890 --> 01:22:47,324
I'm gonna fucking kill both of you!

989
01:22:47,570 --> 01:22:49,845
Very funny.
What about the shipment?

990
01:22:55,290 --> 01:22:57,281
The shipment, Mr. Murtaugh.

991
01:22:57,730 --> 01:22:59,482
Go spit!

992
01:23:00,770 --> 01:23:01,646
Salt.

993
01:23:16,530 --> 01:23:20,205
Go spit, you son of a bitch.
Fuck you!

994
01:23:21,010 --> 01:23:22,568
This is getting nowhere.

995
01:23:22,770 --> 01:23:23,885
Mr. Large.

996
01:23:30,850 --> 01:23:32,124
He knows shit. We're safe.

997
01:23:32,330 --> 01:23:35,083
He'd have told us.
Nobody can take that.

998
01:23:35,770 --> 01:23:37,044
Fine.

999
01:23:37,250 --> 01:23:38,603
Badass soldier, huh?

1000
01:23:52,650 --> 01:23:53,765
Get her up.

1001
01:23:58,690 --> 01:24:01,250
Untie me and I'll kill all of you bastards!

1002
01:24:01,450 --> 01:24:03,122
Tell me what you know.

1003
01:24:03,330 --> 01:24:05,924
Fuck you, bastard!
I'll kill you!

1004
01:24:13,090 --> 01:24:14,808
Sorry, pal.
Say good night.

1005
01:24:35,770 --> 01:24:38,887
That's a real good-looking young woman...

1006
01:24:39,090 --> 01:24:41,365
...you got there, Mr. Murtaugh.

1007
01:24:44,170 --> 01:24:45,319
I've told you everything.

1008
01:24:45,530 --> 01:24:46,963
We'll soon know, won't we?

1009
01:24:47,170 --> 01:24:48,683
I'm warning you.

1010
01:24:49,130 --> 01:24:49,926
Don't.

1011
01:24:50,370 --> 01:24:52,486
Spare me, son. It's over.

1012
01:24:52,970 --> 01:24:55,325
There's no more heroes left in the world.

1013
01:25:00,570 --> 01:25:01,764
Kill that son of a bitch!

1014
01:25:12,770 --> 01:25:14,362
That asshole's getting away!

1015
01:25:14,610 --> 01:25:16,521
Who's fucking next?

1016
01:25:16,970 --> 01:25:18,449
McAllister!

1017
01:25:18,690 --> 01:25:19,805
Who's next?

1018
01:25:22,770 --> 01:25:24,283
Pretty thin, huh?

1019
01:25:24,530 --> 01:25:25,929
Anorexic.

1020
01:25:33,130 --> 01:25:35,325
-Let's do what the shepherd did.
-What?

1021
01:25:35,530 --> 01:25:37,248
Get the flock out of here.

1022
01:25:48,690 --> 01:25:50,009
Is it him?

1023
01:25:50,330 --> 01:25:52,366
No. It's not Joshua.

1024
01:27:06,130 --> 01:27:07,882
Halt! Stop! Stop!

1025
01:27:08,090 --> 01:27:10,729
Get out of the fucking car!
Come on, now!

1026
01:27:13,450 --> 01:27:14,485
Police officers!

1027
01:27:30,370 --> 01:27:35,080
I'm a police officer. Give me
some backup and take care of the girl.

1028
01:28:03,930 --> 01:28:05,727
He's going for the freeway!

1029
01:28:05,930 --> 01:28:06,726
You okay?

1030
01:28:11,050 --> 01:28:14,884
Cut over the 3rd Street bridge!
You'll get ahead of him.

1031
01:28:17,890 --> 01:28:19,642
General McAllister...

1032
01:28:21,250 --> 01:28:23,206
...time for you to die.

1033
01:29:09,650 --> 01:29:10,765
Hold it!

1034
01:29:32,570 --> 01:29:34,242
Get back in your car!

1035
01:29:55,450 --> 01:29:57,486
Mind if I test drive your Audi?

1036
01:30:00,970 --> 01:30:03,086
Stop the son of a bitch!

1037
01:30:07,970 --> 01:30:08,846
Shit!

1038
01:30:10,890 --> 01:30:12,164
He got my car!

1039
01:30:14,890 --> 01:30:16,881
-Get back!
-Hey, man, I'm cool.

1040
01:30:27,570 --> 01:30:29,128
Let's get out of here!

1041
01:30:32,930 --> 01:30:33,885
Open the door!

1042
01:30:43,570 --> 01:30:45,765
Kill that cop son of a bitch!

1043
01:30:48,090 --> 01:30:50,399
No way you live. No way.

1044
01:32:12,970 --> 01:32:15,040
-Gangway!
-Hold it now.

1045
01:32:15,290 --> 01:32:17,326
-Police officer.
-Go ahead.

1046
01:32:22,570 --> 01:32:25,243
Well, shit!
What now, kid?

1047
01:32:25,850 --> 01:32:28,364
First thing, we get you to hospital.

1048
01:32:28,890 --> 01:32:30,482
Come on. Let's go.

1049
01:32:31,330 --> 01:32:34,003
Don't breathe this stuff.
You'll see pink elephants.

1050
01:32:34,250 --> 01:32:36,127
The slippery son of a bitch got away!

1051
01:32:36,370 --> 01:32:38,930
-What do you mean he got away?
-Hey, fire me.

1052
01:32:41,970 --> 01:32:43,085
Where you going?

1053
01:32:43,410 --> 01:32:45,207
Sarge, I'm commandeering your car.

1054
01:32:45,450 --> 01:32:46,678
What's the matter?

1055
01:32:46,890 --> 01:32:49,358
My home!
The bastard knows where I live.

1056
01:32:49,570 --> 01:32:51,367
I'll drive, Cochise.

1057
01:32:52,370 --> 01:32:54,930
-I got to look at him!
-He's all right.

1058
01:32:58,170 --> 01:33:00,809
3-W-30 en route to
Sgt. Murtaugh's residence.

1059
01:33:01,050 --> 01:33:03,245
Requesting additional units.

1060
01:33:35,650 --> 01:33:37,402
Excuse me, sir.
May we help you?

1061
01:33:37,890 --> 01:33:38,845
No, thank you.

1062
01:34:05,090 --> 01:34:06,887
Good morning, sir.

1063
01:34:08,050 --> 01:34:10,120
Tell me, what day is it?

1064
01:34:11,450 --> 01:34:13,042
Goddamn Christmas!

1065
01:34:14,530 --> 01:34:16,885
I'll give you a home to come back to.

1066
01:34:34,250 --> 01:34:36,366
Crazy son of a bitch!

1067
01:34:55,130 --> 01:34:56,688
Give me that. Drop it.

1068
01:35:06,010 --> 01:35:07,443
Looking for the general?

1069
01:35:08,850 --> 01:35:12,525
He's barbecuing his nuts
on Hollywood Boulevard.

1070
01:35:19,970 --> 01:35:21,722
What do you say, Jack?

1071
01:35:22,690 --> 01:35:24,362
Like a shot at the title?

1072
01:35:25,330 --> 01:35:26,922
Don't mind if I do.

1073
01:35:42,930 --> 01:35:47,162
Okay, men! I'm Sgt. Murtaugh.
My responsibility here!

1074
01:35:47,930 --> 01:35:49,522
Watch commander is en route.

1075
01:35:49,770 --> 01:35:53,080
Until then, Sgt. Murtaugh
is in charge on site.

1076
01:35:57,090 --> 01:35:59,081
Just keep the citizens clear.

1077
01:36:10,570 --> 01:36:12,242
Keep everyone back!

1078
01:36:20,170 --> 01:36:23,003
It's Sgt. Riggs' arrest.
I take full responsibility!

1079
01:36:23,210 --> 01:36:25,485
The son of a bitch killed two of our men!

1080
01:36:31,170 --> 01:36:32,603
Get him, kid!
He's yours!

1081
01:36:46,930 --> 01:36:48,602
Come on, Riggs! Come on!

1082
01:36:56,810 --> 01:36:59,404
You wanna quit now?
You wanna quit?

1083
01:37:08,570 --> 01:37:10,481
Give me your nightstick!

1084
01:37:20,090 --> 01:37:21,079
Come on!

1085
01:37:21,890 --> 01:37:23,243
Show me what you got!

1086
01:37:29,890 --> 01:37:31,323
Eat this, sucker!

1087
01:37:55,970 --> 01:37:57,005
Let them take him!

1088
01:37:57,970 --> 01:37:59,403
Let me take him!

1089
01:38:01,490 --> 01:38:03,003
No! Back off!

1090
01:38:40,210 --> 01:38:41,529
Break his fucking neck!

1091
01:38:49,410 --> 01:38:50,206
It's not worth it.

1092
01:38:56,090 --> 01:38:57,364
You lose.

1093
01:39:05,650 --> 01:39:07,720
Get that shit off my lawn!

1094
01:39:12,650 --> 01:39:13,969
How you doing, kid?

1095
01:39:38,530 --> 01:39:39,804
I got you.

1096
01:39:40,250 --> 01:39:41,649
I got you, partner.

1097
01:40:17,010 --> 01:40:19,080
Merry Christmas, Victoria Lynn.

1098
01:40:20,770 --> 01:40:21,998
I love you.

1099
01:40:46,130 --> 01:40:47,245
How are you?

1100
01:40:47,890 --> 01:40:50,120
I'm going to be all right. You?

1101
01:40:50,490 --> 01:40:51,718
I'm good.

1102
01:40:54,770 --> 01:40:56,567
Give this to your dad, okay?

1103
01:40:56,890 --> 01:40:59,927
It's a present for him.
Tell him I won't need it anymore.

1104
01:41:00,690 --> 01:41:03,602
-It's a bullet.
-Yeah, it's a bullet.

1105
01:41:04,370 --> 01:41:05,849
He'll understand.

1106
01:41:07,490 --> 01:41:09,481
You want to come in?
We're building.

1107
01:41:11,370 --> 01:41:13,247
No, I gotta go.

1108
01:41:15,490 --> 01:41:17,481
You have a nice Christmas, though.

1109
01:41:18,010 --> 01:41:19,238
Okay. You too.

1110
01:41:20,290 --> 01:41:21,166
Okay. Bye.

1111
01:41:21,490 --> 01:41:22,605
Bye.

1112
01:41:37,010 --> 01:41:39,001
After all we've been through...

1113
01:41:39,210 --> 01:41:43,249
...if you think I'm gonna eat
the world's worst turkey by myself...

1114
01:41:43,490 --> 01:41:44,559
...you're crazy.

1115
01:41:45,650 --> 01:41:48,403
-I'll tell you a little secret.
-What?

1116
01:41:48,610 --> 01:41:49,884
I'm not crazy.

1117
01:41:52,410 --> 01:41:53,286
I know.

1118
01:41:54,170 --> 01:41:55,239
Oh, good. Let's eat.

1119
01:41:56,770 --> 01:41:58,249
Hey, you know something?

1120
01:41:58,450 --> 01:42:00,327
I think your daughter likes me.

1121
01:42:00,570 --> 01:42:02,845
-If you touch her, I'll kill you.
-You'll try.

1122
01:42:03,090 --> 01:42:06,207
-You mind if I bring a friend?
-Of course, bring a friend.

1123
01:42:14,290 --> 01:42:16,406
I don't think the cat will like this.

1124
01:42:16,650 --> 01:42:18,606
I'll put five on the mutt.

1125
01:42:27,170 --> 01:42:29,286
I'm too old for this.

1126
01:45:03,970 --> 01:45:04,959
