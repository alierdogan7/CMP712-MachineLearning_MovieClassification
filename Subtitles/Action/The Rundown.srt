- With that kind of money,
invite him back yourself.
- The boy doesn't trust me.

165
00:10:38,651 --> 00:10:42,382
- Kidnapping's gonna help.
- Is that sarcasm?

166
00:10:42,455 --> 00:10:45,720
You wanna be sarcastic,
you do it to your monkey friends.

167
00:10:45,792 --> 00:10:47,726
You do not do it to me!

168
00:10:47,794 --> 00:10:50,922
Do you understand?

169
00:10:52,765 --> 00:10:54,995
I'm sorry, Billy.

170
00:10:55,068 --> 00:10:57,901
You're goddamn right
you are.

171
00:11:00,506 --> 00:11:03,942
- What'd he do?
- Pissed off the wrong people.

172
00:11:04,010 --> 00:11:08,344
I don't have to
remind you what happens
when you do that, do I?

173
00:11:08,448 --> 00:11:10,382
So I bought him
some forgiveness.

174
00:11:10,450 --> 00:11:12,975
But if I don't bring him
back here to face the music,

175
00:11:13,086 --> 00:11:16,351
you know damn well
that I can't carry a tune.

176
00:11:16,422 --> 00:11:18,549
So, you deliver
my boy back here.

177
00:11:18,624 --> 00:11:21,388
You bring him
right through that door,

178
00:11:21,461 --> 00:11:24,157
you walk out of this house
a free man...

179
00:11:24,230 --> 00:11:26,858
with a restaurant.

180
00:11:26,933 --> 00:11:30,027
His final words

181
00:11:30,236 --> 00:11:33,865
Don't take your guns to town, son

182
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:37,603
Leave your guns at home, Bill

183
00:11:37,677 --> 00:11:41,670
Don't take your guns to town

184
00:12:01,834 --> 00:12:05,429
Is that duct tape?
Oh, aye. Aye, aye.

185
00:12:06,839 --> 00:12:11,242
Don't worry there, little fella.
Walk by faith, not by sight. Hmm?

186
00:12:17,016 --> 00:12:19,610
Will you look at that?
We can't land now.

187
00:12:19,719 --> 00:12:23,621
- Why? Why can't we land?
- They got the "booze on the grind."

188
00:12:23,689 --> 00:12:29,286
"Booze on the grind"?
Aye, the bulls on the ground.
The cattle down there.

189
00:12:29,362 --> 00:12:32,058
Cows.
Yeah. I'll give them
a wee fright there.

190
00:12:32,131 --> 00:12:35,828
Ah, get moving! Ah, come on then!
Outta me way!

191
00:12:35,902 --> 00:12:38,462
Outta me way, you.!

192
00:12:38,538 --> 00:12:41,803
Move it.!
Move it now.! Shoo.!

193
00:12:44,510 --> 00:12:48,173
Outta my way.!

194
00:12:48,247 --> 00:12:50,943
Outta me way.

197
00:13:12,472 --> 00:13:14,940
All right there, get off the...
Okay, gotcha.

198
00:13:15,007 --> 00:13:19,341
Hey, Sugie, what'd I tell you
about not let... My needle
was totally nackered.

199
00:13:19,412 --> 00:13:22,245
R.P.M. s all over the shaft.

200
00:13:24,517 --> 00:13:27,452
- Is this the only road in and out?
- If you wanna stay alive.

201
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:31,149
- Why's that?
- That there, that's the jungle, little fella.

202
00:13:31,224 --> 00:13:35,820
You got anacondas in there.
Poison arrow frogs, black flies,
bullet ants.

203
00:13:35,895 --> 00:13:38,056
If they don't get you,
the rebels will.

204
00:13:38,131 --> 00:13:40,793
- What?
- Aye, rebels.
That's what I'm telling you.

205
00:13:40,867 --> 00:13:44,462
To them, Cornelius Hatcher's
built a Babylon in paradise.

206
00:13:44,537 --> 00:13:47,301
- Built a what?
- A Babylon.

207
00:13:51,444 --> 00:13:53,469
Yeah, that mine...

208
00:13:53,546 --> 00:13:56,413
is as close as a man can come
to the gates ofhell,

209
00:13:56,516 --> 00:13:58,677
while his heart's still beating.

210
00:14:05,291 --> 00:14:07,589
The Sunday school picnic
is over, I'll tell you that.

211
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:10,185
Stay out of the jungle,
little fella, okay?

212

[Horn Honking]

213
00:14:50,236 --> 00:14:54,400
I, uh... I found these flowers
growing in the deepest parts
of the jungle.

214
00:14:54,473 --> 00:14:57,408
As far as I can tell,
no one's ever identified them,

215
00:14:57,476 --> 00:15:01,071
which means that I'm responsible
for naming them.

216
00:15:01,147 --> 00:15:03,342
I can only think of one word...

217
00:15:03,449 --> 00:15:06,009
that fits something
so beautiful.

218
00:15:07,119 --> 00:15:09,144
Mariana.

219
00:15:11,891 --> 00:15:14,189
How much do you want?

220
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:16,558
- What?
- How much?

221
00:15:16,629 --> 00:15:19,530
I need your uncle's boat.
A day or two, max.
Mariana, listen.

222
00:15:19,599 --> 00:15:22,568
You borrow my car,
you bring it back with no windshield.
You borrow my brother's scooter...

223
00:15:22,635 --> 00:15:24,626
The scooter was mechanical.
It wasn't my fault.

224
00:15:24,704 --> 00:15:27,229
Now you want to
borrow my uncle's boat?
And, "I found it. I found it."

225
00:15:27,306 --> 00:15:29,536
You will never find
this "Garbo" of yours.

226
00:15:29,609 --> 00:15:32,043
Shh, it's gato.
I told you.

227
00:15:32,111 --> 00:15:34,807
- Gato.
- It's out there, Mariana.

228
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:39,374
I know exactly where it is.
But I need that boat.

229
00:15:43,089 --> 00:15:45,216
How much?
I told you...

230
00:15:45,291 --> 00:15:47,782
No, how much
is your gato worth?

231
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:50,920
- This is a very significant
academic find, Mariana.
- How much?

232
00:15:50,997 --> 00:15:53,022
- It's not about money.
- You lie like a little girl.

233
00:15:53,099 --> 00:15:55,158
I'm not lying.

234
00:15:55,234 --> 00:15:59,102
If I get the boat for you,
you have to take me with you.

235
00:15:59,171 --> 00:16:01,435
That's ridiculous.
We're talking about
a lousy boat here.

236
00:16:01,507 --> 00:16:04,237
And we split the take
50-50.
I've been doing all the work, okay?

237
00:16:04,310 --> 00:16:08,269
I found it. No way.
Fifty-fifty, Travis.

238
00:16:09,982 --> 00:16:12,143
Seventy-thirty.
Fifty-fifty.

239
00:16:12,251 --> 00:16:15,015
- Sixty-forty.
- Fifty-fifty, and I get off
of work at 6:00.

240
00:16:15,087 --> 00:16:17,282
Then we can go
and get your gato.

241
00:16:17,356 --> 00:16:19,551
You're evil.

242
00:16:22,662 --> 00:16:24,596
Thank you.
Whatever.

243
00:16:24,664 --> 00:16:27,292
For the flowers.

244
00:16:49,388 --> 00:16:52,323
Harvey, someone here
to see your brother.

245
00:16:53,626 --> 00:16:55,924
- Where's he from?
- He's an American.

246
00:16:55,995 --> 00:16:58,520
- You got a gun?
- No, I don't like guns.

247
00:16:58,597 --> 00:17:01,122

All right. Let's go.

Come on.

Come on.

258
00:17:52,485 --> 00:17:54,578
Never met an American
who didn't like guns.

259

Tell 'em to dig harder.

260
00:18:04,063 --> 00:18:07,931
If only it were that simple,
eh, Mr. Beck?

261
00:18:09,068 --> 00:18:11,468
- How do you know my name?
- When a man of your dimensions...

262
00:18:11,537 --> 00:18:15,064
travels all this way
to visit a place like this,

263
00:18:15,141 --> 00:18:17,336
it arouses the curiosity.

264
00:18:17,410 --> 00:18:20,675
What can I do for you?
Do you know this man?

265
00:18:21,981 --> 00:18:24,677
Ah, Travis Walker.

266
00:18:24,784 --> 00:18:26,718
I let him do some excavating
around the mine,

267
00:18:26,786 --> 00:18:29,084
allow him to rent a room
in my town,

268
00:18:29,155 --> 00:18:32,318
all for a fair 60%
of anything he might unearth.

269
00:18:32,391 --> 00:18:34,757
Can you tell me
where to find him?
Yeah, just follow the bullshit.

270
00:18:34,827 --> 00:18:36,988
The guy's got a mouth
should be in the circus.

271
00:18:37,062 --> 00:18:40,293
Brother, please.
Do you have business with him?

272
00:18:40,366 --> 00:18:43,961
I do.
Good. What kind of business?
I love business.

273
00:18:44,036 --> 00:18:45,936
It's personal.

274
00:18:46,005 --> 00:18:48,269
So, why come to me?

275
00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:51,104
When I'm a guest
in another man's house,
Ah.

276
00:18:51,177 --> 00:18:53,975
I don't reach into his refrigerator
without asking permission.

Refrigerator?
I wanna show you something,
Mr. Beck.

278
00:19:04,824 --> 00:19:08,282
Does that look like
a refrigerator to you?

279
00:19:12,998 --> 00:19:15,296
Looks more like hell.

280
00:19:15,367 --> 00:19:19,895
Well, you see hell.
I see a spellbinding
sense of purpose.

281

I see the value
of keeping your eye on the ball.

lays his hands on a Rolex,

00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:35,743
when a rapper
gets a shiny new tooth,

285
00:19:35,855 --> 00:19:38,551
this is that cost, Mr. Beck.

286
00:19:38,624 --> 00:19:43,027
My horror for their beauty.
My hell for their little slice of heaven.

287

Somebody's gotta
keep his eye on the ball.

288
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:49,791
That somebody is me, Mr. Beck.

289
00:19:49,869 --> 00:19:52,497
I am down here every day...

290
00:19:52,571 --> 00:19:55,005
keeping my eye on the ball.

291
00:19:55,074 --> 00:19:57,406
That's just a simple fact oflife.

292
00:19:57,476 --> 00:20:01,344
And if you're bold enough
to face that cold, hard fact,

293
00:20:01,413 --> 00:20:04,712
you can make a lot of money.

294
00:20:07,820 --> 00:20:11,085

- I've come to take him home.

I'll give you $1,000.

I need you to take my bag
back to the plane.

300

Keep the engine running.
Can you do that?

301
00:20:31,644 --> 00:20:33,839

That's right.

I'll take a beer.

The smiling fool.

312
00:21:52,658 --> 00:21:57,322
You know, back in the States,
Brazil nuts like these
go for $15 a pound.

313
00:21:58,831 --> 00:22:01,391
Well, those fell
off the tree out back.

314
00:22:01,467 --> 00:22:04,265
And around here
we don't call them Brazil nuts.

315
00:22:04,336 --> 00:22:07,464
What do you call 'em?
Well, we're in Brazil,

316
00:22:07,539 --> 00:22:09,700
so we just call them nuts.

317
00:22:11,677 --> 00:22:16,011
Fair enough.
So what brings you to the Amazon?
Other than the food and drink, of course.

318

I'm looking for a man.

- What's your type?
- His name's Travis Walker.

Brown hair, he's in his 20s.
Wears a blue shirt, jeans.

321
00:22:28,060 --> 00:22:31,086
Right now, he's got a real
bewildered look on his face.

322
00:22:31,163 --> 00:22:33,723
- Do I know you?
- The name's Beck.

323
00:22:33,799 --> 00:22:36,233
What can I do for you,
Mr. Beck?

324
00:22:36,301 --> 00:22:39,702
I need you to make
a choice for me.
A choice.

325
00:22:39,772 --> 00:22:42,366
Option "A" or option "B"?
What's option "A"?

326
00:22:42,441 --> 00:22:45,376
Well, option 'A"is you and I
walk outta here nice and easy,

and we drive back
to the airstrip.

328
00:22:47,613 --> 00:22:51,105
And then we begin
our long journey
back to Los Angeles.

329
00:22:51,216 --> 00:22:53,150
Be no blood,
no broken bones.

330
00:22:54,953 --> 00:22:58,889
And no problems.
[Chuckles]
What's in Los Angeles?

331
00:22:58,991 --> 00:23:01,687
Your father.

332
00:23:05,030 --> 00:23:08,431
What's option "B"?
Pretty much
the opposite of"A."

333
00:23:10,235 --> 00:23:12,169
But I wouldn't recommend
that one.

334
00:23:13,472 --> 00:23:15,770
I'll take option "C."

335
00:23:15,841 --> 00:23:19,834
Travis, there is no option "C."

336
00:23:19,912 --> 00:23:22,676
Really?
Mm-hmm.

337
00:23:23,782 --> 00:23:28,412
Are you sure?
I mean, big boy,

338
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:30,886
there's always an option "C."

339
00:23:34,693 --> 00:23:38,754
[Groans, Whimpers]

340
00:23:38,831 --> 00:23:41,231
- Ow, ow.! So angry.!
- Shut up.

341
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:44,633
Shut up!
Ow! Ow! Ow!

342
00:23:44,703 --> 00:23:47,331
Like I said,
there is no option "C."

343
00:23:52,311 --> 00:23:54,472
Let me introduce you
to option "C."

344
00:23:54,546 --> 00:23:56,480
[Hatcher]
Mr. Beck.

345
00:23:59,485 --> 00:24:01,783
There's been a slight change
in the narrative.

346
00:24:01,887 --> 00:24:04,617
An unexpected twist
you might say.

347
00:24:04,656 --> 00:24:06,988
Can I have a beer, please?

348
00:24:07,059 --> 00:24:10,495
Mr. Hatcher, I was just gonna
come find you when this...

349
00:24:10,562 --> 00:24:14,259
- The kid stays.
- I paid you.

350
00:24:14,333 --> 00:24:17,166
Well, fortunately,
I had my fingers crossed
the whole time.

351
00:24:17,236 --> 00:24:21,730
Apparently, young Mr. Walker
may have stumbled
onto a trinket of some value,

352
00:24:21,807 --> 00:24:25,766
and as he's located it
in myjungle,

353
00:24:25,844 --> 00:24:29,336
yup, I'm gonna need him
to lead me to it.

354
00:24:36,722 --> 00:24:38,747
Okay, so let's go, dickhead.

355
00:24:38,857 --> 00:24:42,816
- Don't call me a dickhead, you dickhead.
- Did you find it or not, asshole?

356
00:24:42,895 --> 00:24:46,058
- What's that, asshole?
- Harvey.
- Did you find it or not, asshole?

357
00:24:46,131 --> 00:24:48,122
- What's that, asshole?
- Did you find it or not, asshole?

358
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:50,828
- Don't!
- Hey, don't rock the boat.

359
00:24:52,638 --> 00:24:57,041
[Scoffs]
Okay.

360
00:24:58,877 --> 00:25:01,812
I don't want any trouble.
Then leave now
and don't come back.

361
00:25:01,914 --> 00:25:04,906
And the 10,000?
Consider it tax deductible.

362
00:25:04,950 --> 00:25:07,976
A contribution
to your personal health fund.

363
00:25:08,086 --> 00:25:10,179
With all due respect,
Mr. Hatcher,

364
00:25:10,289 --> 00:25:12,223
I'm feeling pretty healthy.

365
00:25:12,291 --> 00:25:14,350
- Oh, yeah?
- Walk.

366
00:25:17,029 --> 00:25:19,020
Don't make waves.

367
00:25:22,734 --> 00:25:25,066
Look out for the chair!

368
00:25:52,698 --> 00:25:54,757
- Wow.
- [Harvey Whimpering]

369
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:05,009
You're gonna kill us all,
Mr. Beck?

[Groans]

372
00:26:20,125 --> 00:26:23,583
I tried to be reasonable.

373
00:26:23,662 --> 00:26:25,721
It's not the way to do business.

374
00:26:34,006 --> 00:26:35,871
You should have kept the gun.

375
00:26:50,756 --> 00:26:54,920
You're dead already.
You just don't know it yet.

376
00:26:55,494 --> 00:26:57,587
This is option "B"?
Are you kidding me?

377
00:26:57,663 --> 00:27:01,429
Quiet.
You're dead.
You're so dead.

378
00:27:03,502 --> 00:27:06,733
We're not gonna
be able to get outta here.
All this land, Hatcher owns it.

379
00:27:06,805 --> 00:27:10,605
- The road that you're on, the air that
you're breathing, Hatcher owns it all.
- Shut up.

380
00:27:10,676 --> 00:27:13,110
Whatever my father's paying you,
I will double it.
No.

381
00:27:13,178 --> 00:27:16,636
I'll quadruple it.
I'll double it and quadruple it.
No. No.

382
00:27:16,748 --> 00:27:18,807
You're being unreasonable.

383
00:27:20,085 --> 00:27:22,451
I'm gonna give you
one more chance to reconsider.

384
00:27:22,521 --> 00:27:25,285
- I'll give you one chance
to shut your mouth.
- Is that your final answer?

385
00:27:28,894 --> 00:27:32,261
For what it's worth,
I hope you enjoy the fall.

386
00:27:32,331 --> 00:27:34,492
- Yeah, what fall?
- This fall.

00:28:20,545 --> 00:28:23,378
- Oh!
- Whoo-hoo.!

Whoa!

00:29:06,191 --> 00:29:08,682
Come on.
Where are the frickin' keys?

Good God.

399
00:29:37,989 --> 00:29:40,856
I'm not going back.
Oh, you're going back.

400
00:29:40,926 --> 00:29:43,656
No way.
Right now.

401
00:29:43,728 --> 00:29:46,595
Who the hell
do you think you are, huh?

402
00:29:46,665 --> 00:29:51,068
You come into my town,
mess up my bar.

403
00:29:51,136 --> 00:29:53,969
- And you eyeball my woman.
- Eyeball your woman?

404
00:29:54,039 --> 00:29:56,007
No, it's on.

405
00:29:57,776 --> 00:30:00,939
What's this, huh?
Who is this?

406
00:30:01,012 --> 00:30:02,946
Is he your friend?
Do you know him?

407
00:30:03,014 --> 00:30:05,448
Do you? Say hello.

408
00:30:05,517 --> 00:30:08,816

Are you finished?
Let's go.

Big boy,
you like thunderstorms, huh?

412
00:30:23,635 --> 00:30:26,798
Bet you do, right?
Uh-huh.

413
00:30:26,872 --> 00:30:29,170
Little thunder.
Little lightning.
Stop it.

414
00:30:29,241 --> 00:30:32,233
Stop it!
Thunder, lightning.

Obviously we got off
on the wrong foot here,

422
00:31:02,807 --> 00:31:05,071
so I'm gonna
be completely candid with you.

Have you ever heard of
the Gato do Diabo?

- The devil's cat.
- You're gonna stop speaking
right now.

All right. Oh!

Forged out of pure gold.

428
00:31:20,525 --> 00:31:23,460
- It's worth millions.
- Thought you said it was priceless.

429
00:31:23,528 --> 00:31:25,621
You do not want to argue semantics
with a Ph.D. candidate.

430
00:31:25,697 --> 00:31:28,257
- Ph.D.?
- Yeah. Oh!

Dropped out of Stanford
after two semesters, Einstein.

So, I'm fairly close.
Closer than you.

434
00:31:38,543 --> 00:31:40,807
You're close to getting
your ass kicked again.
We got a plane to catch.

435
00:31:40,879 --> 00:31:43,712
Wait. Wait. Wait.
The gato is real, all right?

436
00:31:43,815 --> 00:31:47,182
I know where to find it.
I'll split it with you, 80-20.

Move.
Seventy-thirty?

00:32:25,023 --> 00:32:27,082
I'm gonna cut
that kid's nose off.

00:32:31,096 --> 00:32:33,826
No, Harvey,
you wanna get the gato,

443
00:32:33,898 --> 00:32:37,493
'cause if the bad guys get it,
they won't need us anymore.

444
00:32:37,569 --> 00:32:41,437
There'll be no one
to work the mine.
You wanna work the mine?

445
00:32:49,948 --> 00:32:53,679
There are two men in that jungle
who are trying to steal from me.

446
00:32:53,785 --> 00:32:57,983
I feel like a little boy
who's lost his first tooth.

447
00:32:58,056 --> 00:33:02,720
Put it under his pillow,
waiting for the tooth fairy to come.

448
00:33:02,794 --> 00:33:07,857
Only, two evil burglars
have crept in my window...

449
00:33:07,932 --> 00:33:12,198
and snatched it
before she could get here.

- Wait a second.

00:33:37,429 --> 00:33:40,830
Wait. She takes the goddamn thing,
gives you a quarter.

00:33:40,899 --> 00:33:45,063
They got my tooth.
I want it back.

457
00:33:59,684 --> 00:34:03,882
I have to ask you,
back at the bar, man.
That was crazy.

No guns.
Strip, toss. Toss, strip.

00:34:06,257 --> 00:34:08,191
Didn't I tell you to be quiet?
I know. I know.

460
00:34:08,259 --> 00:34:12,218
But what is that?
Some kind of nouveau
Samurai code or something?

461
00:34:12,297 --> 00:34:16,063
You got a problem with guns?
Let's just say they take me
to a place I don't wanna go.

462
00:34:16,134 --> 00:34:18,500
Where do they take you?

463
00:34:18,570 --> 00:34:20,902
To a place you don't wanna
see me go. Walk.

464
00:34:23,408 --> 00:34:25,342
How often
do you work out?

465
00:34:30,782 --> 00:34:33,876
Let me get this straight.
You never use guns?
No.

466
00:34:33,985 --> 00:34:35,976
Never?
Never.

467
00:34:36,087 --> 00:34:38,180
If your best friend
was gonna die?
You wouldn't pick up a gun?

No guns.
Santa Claus would pick up
a gun to save his best friend.

Do I look like Santa Claus?
Do I look like Santa Claus to you?

un poco loco?

I pick up guns,
bad things happen to people.
I don't like that.

Very bad things, Travis.
Walk.

Now, the question is,
Mr. Beck, what's good
for your business?

Huh? You don't like money?

480
00:35:13,625 --> 00:35:15,593
I don't make deals
with people like you.

481
00:35:15,660 --> 00:35:17,628
[Snickers]
You don't even know me.

482
00:35:17,695 --> 00:35:20,061
You're just like
every other jackass
I've taken down.

483
00:35:20,131 --> 00:35:23,567
First they try to run,
then they try to fight,
then they try to negotiate.

484
00:35:23,635 --> 00:35:27,935
When that doesn't work, they do
exactly what you're about to do
when you realize it's over.

485
00:35:28,006 --> 00:35:30,133
Oh, yeah?
What's that?

486
00:35:30,208 --> 00:35:33,473
You're gonna get down
on your hands and knees
and you're gonna beg me for a break.

487
00:35:33,545 --> 00:35:37,982
Well, guess what.
I don't give breaks. No breaks.

488

[Snickers]
You don't understand
the situation.

You borrowed money
from the wrong guy.

Sack to hold the dirt,
another dollar.

656
00:49:39,957 --> 00:49:43,051
Mr. Beck knows a lot
about that, don't you?

657
00:49:43,127 --> 00:49:46,290
He knows what it's like
to dig a hole so deep
you can never climb out.

658
00:49:46,363 --> 00:49:51,027
Call it what you want.
Escravidão. Slavery.

659
00:49:51,101 --> 00:49:53,331
And we intend to stop it.

[Portuguese]

661
00:50:02,212 --> 00:50:04,703
Manito wants to know
who you think would win a fight...

662
00:50:04,815 --> 00:50:06,749
between Mike Tyson
and Muhammad Ali.

663
00:50:09,119 --> 00:50:11,053
Ali. Hands down.

[Portuguese]

665
00:50:14,291 --> 00:50:17,454
He says
what about Tyson's power?
Shit.

666
00:50:17,528 --> 00:50:20,588
Tell him Ali would have done to Tyson
what he did to Foreman in Africa.

667
00:50:20,664 --> 00:50:24,100
Ah, Rumble...
Rumble in theJungle.

668
00:50:25,169 --> 00:50:27,933
- Tell him Ali was too smart.
- [Portuguese]

669
00:50:28,005 --> 00:50:30,530
Too smart, too fast.
He would have used his jabs.
Bam.! Bam.!

670
00:50:30,607 --> 00:50:33,474
- [Mariana Translates]
- Would have danced.

671
00:50:33,544 --> 00:50:37,071
Would have played with his mind.
Before you know it,
bam, left to the body.

672
00:50:37,147 --> 00:50:39,980
- Bam, right to the head.
- [Portuguese]

673
00:50:40,084 --> 00:50:42,712
Down goes Tyson.

674
00:50:42,820 --> 00:50:44,788
Float like butterfly.

675
00:50:44,855 --> 00:50:47,619
Sting like bee.

676
00:50:49,126 --> 00:50:52,254
Float like butterfly,
sting like bee.

677
00:50:52,329 --> 00:50:55,355
[Gang]
Float like butterfly,
sting like a bee.

678
00:50:55,432 --> 00:51:00,369
Float like butterfly,

[Portuguese]

680
00:51:18,989 --> 00:51:21,958
He says he thinks
you are a great fighter.

681
00:51:23,060 --> 00:51:26,359
And he wants you to have it.
It's for luck.

682
00:51:26,430 --> 00:51:30,332
- Tell him I'm sorry. I can't.
- You'll offend him if you refuse.

683
00:51:35,372 --> 00:51:37,636
I'm honored. Thank you.

684
00:51:41,044 --> 00:51:43,535
[Mariana]
You'll need all the luck
you can get.

685
00:51:43,614 --> 00:51:46,777
It's a long walk
back to the airfield.

686
00:51:46,884 --> 00:51:48,875
Especially by yourself.

687
00:51:48,986 --> 00:51:51,045
Nice.

688
00:51:51,155 --> 00:51:53,715
You don't understand.

689
00:51:53,791 --> 00:51:55,725
I'm not going back
without him.

690
00:51:55,793 --> 00:51:58,853
- Here we go again.
- Fifty rifles say you are.

691
00:52:02,866 --> 00:52:04,959
And we're rebels, not thieves.

699
00:53:07,631 --> 00:53:09,599
Not so fast, jungle boy.

[Motorcycle Approaches]

701
00:53:14,471 --> 00:53:16,598
Move. Move!

[Mariana]
Come on.

703
00:53:33,156 --> 00:53:35,920
Manito!
Get back, Manito. Vamos.

704
00:53:35,993 --> 00:53:38,461
Go! Go! Go!

705
00:53:38,529 --> 00:53:40,724
Manito!
Let's go!

706
00:54:01,118 --> 00:54:04,918
I want hunting parties.
Small ones.

707
00:54:04,988 --> 00:54:06,922
Find them.

708
00:54:06,990 --> 00:54:09,117
Find them!

709
00:55:14,024 --> 00:55:16,219
[Mariana]
All right, this is the way
it's going to be.

710
00:55:18,128 --> 00:55:20,494
You're going to take me
to El Gato do Diabo.

711
00:55:23,033 --> 00:55:25,729
And you're going to take me now.

712
00:55:25,802 --> 00:55:27,633
- Calm down.
- Don't!

713
00:55:27,704 --> 00:55:30,400
You saw what they do.
Don't ever tell me to calm down.

714
00:55:30,474 --> 00:55:34,205
- Travis, don't play with me.
- Or what?

715
00:55:34,277 --> 00:55:36,245
Or I'm going to shoot you.

716
00:55:36,313 --> 00:55:38,645
Well, if you shoot me,
you're never gonna find the gato.

717
00:55:38,749 --> 00:55:41,217
So, we're gonna make
a little deal.

718
00:55:41,318 --> 00:55:45,846
Deal? You see,
El Gato is just an object to you.

719
00:55:45,956 --> 00:55:47,890
It's a life on the Riviera
and a private yacht.

720
00:55:47,958 --> 00:55:50,085
- Lady, you don't know
the first thing about me.
- For us, it's hope.

721
00:55:50,160 --> 00:55:52,424
Oh, you're breakin'my heart.
It's like a telethon.

- You selfish...

Sit down. Sit down!

724
00:55:57,334 --> 00:55:59,859
Holy shit.
You tried to shoot me!

725
00:56:00,804 --> 00:56:02,533
You saw it.

726
00:56:02,606 --> 00:56:04,540
- Crazy...
- Shut up.

727
00:56:04,608 --> 00:56:07,543
You shut up.

728
00:56:09,312 --> 00:56:11,246
The deal is this.
He'll take you to the gato.

729
00:56:11,348 --> 00:56:15,717
You just show me
how I get out of this jungle
so I can take him home. Deal?

730
00:56:18,855 --> 00:56:21,915
Do we... have a deal?

731
00:56:21,992 --> 00:56:24,187
Deal.

732
00:56:24,261 --> 00:56:26,821
Let me get this straight.

733
00:56:26,897 --> 00:56:30,958
She gets what she needs,
you get what you need
and I get the shaft.

734
00:56:31,034 --> 00:56:35,198
- I could always give her back the gun.
- I really don't like you.

735
00:56:35,272 --> 00:56:38,537
- Well, I get that a lot.
- Seriously.

736
00:57:40,103 --> 00:57:45,131
What?
I was just wondering
how it is you came to do,

737
00:57:45,208 --> 00:57:47,142
you know,
whatever it is you do.

738
00:57:49,446 --> 00:57:52,279
- It's a long story.
- It's a long walk.

739
00:57:54,417 --> 00:57:57,750
I grew up
in a very rough place.

740
00:57:57,821 --> 00:58:01,814
One thing led to another,
that's all. Just like you.

741
00:58:01,925 --> 00:58:04,792
Like me?
Yeah. You get pushed,
you push back.

742
00:58:04,828 --> 00:58:08,389
But with me, I pushed so hard
that word got around.

743
00:58:08,465 --> 00:58:13,164
Before I knew it, I was standing
in a room full of the wrong people
with the wrong money.

744
00:58:13,236 --> 00:58:17,673
So you think I'm standing in a room
full of the wrong people?
Yeah.

745
00:58:17,741 --> 00:58:22,769
- Something like that.
- I like you, Mr. Beck.

746
00:58:22,846 --> 00:58:25,371
Really.

747
00:58:25,482 --> 00:58:27,416
But you and I are nothing alike.

00:59:17,734 --> 00:59:20,259
Let's take us a little swim,

- Come on, big boy.
You could use a bath.

It'll be dark soon.

Why? We're already here.

Don't pee in the water.
Why?

758
00:59:51,134 --> 00:59:55,230

swim up the urine into your pau.

It'll swim up your ding-dong.

you can't get it out.

to the jaguar, we'll be okay.

Ooh-ooh!

01:21:13,515 --> 01:21:15,915
Whoo!
[Chittering]

992
01:21:19,721 --> 01:21:22,189
Your... Your ears!

993
01:21:28,197 --> 01:21:30,290
Oh!
[Grunts]

994
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:35,458
Take the gato and the girl
and get to the airfield.

995
01:21:35,537 --> 01:21:38,438
If you run into trouble,
use her as a hostage.

996
01:21:38,507 --> 01:21:41,271
And, Harvey,
when you're safely out of town,

997
01:21:41,343 --> 01:21:44,506
put her out of my misery.

Boom, boom.

1000
01:22:17,613 --> 01:22:19,478
I need help!

1001
01:22:31,860 --> 01:22:33,987
Do not go gentle into that
good night, my lovely.

1002
01:22:35,764 --> 01:22:38,528
Beck! Help, Beck!

1003
01:22:38,600 --> 01:22:40,500
Rage, rage...

1004
01:22:42,471 --> 01:22:44,871
against the dyin'of the light.

1005
01:22:48,744 --> 01:22:51,144
For there shall be no mercy...

1006
01:22:53,982 --> 01:22:56,712
for any force that stands...

1007
01:22:59,955 --> 01:23:02,788

[Muffled]
Beck, help!

1009
01:23:16,371 --> 01:23:19,135

1011
01:23:58,880 --> 01:24:00,939
Move!

[Screaming]

1014
01:24:40,822 --> 01:24:43,086
No way.

1015
01:24:55,203 --> 01:24:57,501
Give me back my gato,
you little bald freak.!

1016
01:25:50,125 --> 01:25:51,649
[Whips Snapping]

1017
01:25:52,961 --> 01:25:54,895
Oh, great.

Whoa!

1021
01:27:40,635 --> 01:27:42,569
See ya.

1022
01:27:43,905 --> 01:27:47,636
You got the moves.
I'll give you that.

1023
01:27:55,450 --> 01:27:57,475
You reached...

1024
01:27:57,586 --> 01:28:00,919
into the wrong refrigerator,
Mr. Beck.

1026
01:28:12,200 --> 01:28:16,136
Hold your horses!
What have I done?

1027
01:28:18,173 --> 01:28:20,073
Are we not men?

1028
01:28:20,141 --> 01:28:22,666
Hatcher?
[Shouts]
What?

1029
01:28:22,744 --> 01:28:25,110
Option "A" is still on the table.
You can walk away right now.

[Chuckling]

1031
01:28:27,816 --> 01:28:30,216
Option "A" doesn't work for me.

1032
01:28:30,285 --> 01:28:32,753
Before I came here,

1033
01:28:32,854 --> 01:28:35,322
what... what did you people have?

1034
01:28:35,390 --> 01:28:40,453
Face it.! Be fair.
I put a roof over your head,
a little coin in your pockets.

1035
01:28:40,528 --> 01:28:44,487
You barefoot Indians
didn't have pockets...

1036
01:28:44,566 --> 01:28:47,330
before Hatcher came along.

1037
01:28:48,903 --> 01:28:53,169
I gave you life!
I'm the heart in the darkness. Face it.

1038
01:28:53,241 --> 01:28:56,540
You can't run this thing without me.

1039
01:28:56,611 --> 01:29:00,604
I am pumping the blood
of the modern world...

1040
01:29:00,715 --> 01:29:04,276
into your backward veins,
you stinkin',

1044
01:29:18,366 --> 01:29:22,393
Okay. That's it. I'm done.

1045
01:29:28,910 --> 01:29:30,844
Mr. Beck.

1046
01:29:34,082 --> 01:29:36,573
I'll take option "A."

1047
01:29:38,687 --> 01:29:41,520

Oh, shit.

1050
01:30:22,497 --> 01:30:25,193
You make a hell of an entrance,
Mr. Beck.

1051
01:30:27,001 --> 01:30:28,935
Yeah.

1052
01:30:34,109 --> 01:30:37,135
I'd offer you a beer,
but I think you blew up my bar.

1053
01:30:38,146 --> 01:30:40,410
Yeah, I think you're right.

1054
01:30:42,383 --> 01:30:44,317
Thank you.

1055
01:30:45,553 --> 01:30:47,987
We had a deal.
Yes, we did.

1056
01:30:49,124 --> 01:30:51,490
And I'm afraid I didn't
deliver on that deal.

1057
01:30:52,694 --> 01:30:54,787
How is that?

1058
01:30:56,397 --> 01:31:00,094
The gato.
I promised you the gato.

1059
01:31:01,569 --> 01:31:03,901
Yes, well, I promised you Travis.

1060
01:31:03,972 --> 01:31:07,032
You all talking
about this Travis?

1061
01:31:08,109 --> 01:31:10,600
And this gato?

1062
01:31:22,056 --> 01:31:25,787
- I'm impressed.
- Yeah, well, make sure
they spell my name right.

1063
01:31:28,496 --> 01:31:31,090
I told you it wasn't
about the money.

1064
01:31:33,234 --> 01:31:36,260
Well, big boy,
I guess it's your move.

1065
01:31:48,283 --> 01:31:50,251
I'm impressed myself, Travis.

1066
01:31:52,787 --> 01:31:55,085
[Shaking Hands]

1067
01:31:55,156 --> 01:31:57,989
Declan, start the plane.

1068
01:31:58,059 --> 01:32:01,859
"Declan, start the plane"?
What does that mean,
"Declan start the plane"?

1069
01:32:01,963 --> 01:32:04,193
I'm taking you home, Travis.
Oh, I figured that.

1070
01:32:04,232 --> 01:32:06,097
No breaks. Good luck.

1071
01:32:06,167 --> 01:32:10,069
You too.
I will send you your cut.

1072
01:32:11,639 --> 01:32:13,698
Move.
Uh-huh.

1073
01:32:14,943 --> 01:32:18,538
Not a penny less than 15.6 million.
Move, Travis.

1074
01:32:18,613 --> 01:32:23,448
You really ought to stay away from guns.
You ought to get yourself
a psychiatrist, seriously.

1075
01:32:27,422 --> 01:32:30,357
[All Cheering]

1076
01:33:17,272 --> 01:33:19,206
Move.

1077
01:33:23,478 --> 01:33:25,969
[Chuckling]
Well, look at him.

1078
01:33:26,047 --> 01:33:30,347
Look at you with your beard.
You're like a real man.
But you're so thin.

1079
01:33:30,451 --> 01:33:33,318
Running is good exercise.
[Laughing]
It's good exercise.

1080
01:33:33,388 --> 01:33:35,856
- That's funny. Did you hear him?
Running for your life?
- Yeah.

1081
01:33:35,924 --> 01:33:38,154
[Laughing]
I love it, I really do.!

1082
01:33:41,062 --> 01:33:45,362
You know, there is not enough aspirin
in the world for a headache like you.

1083
01:33:45,433 --> 01:33:48,630
Well, there probably is,
but I understand what you mean.

1084
01:33:48,703 --> 01:33:51,365
Well, that's good, 'cause
that means you'll understand...

1085
01:33:51,439 --> 01:33:54,465
why you're gonna take that little
trip back to Chicago, huh?

1086
01:33:54,542 --> 01:33:56,772
Actually, I don't completely
understand that one.

1087
01:33:56,844 --> 01:33:58,971
Ah, still the smart-ass.

1088
01:33:59,047 --> 01:34:03,746
I'm not that smart, Dad.
I didn't know she was married.
Well, she was...

1089
01:34:03,851 --> 01:34:05,785
very married.

1090
01:34:07,021 --> 01:34:09,216
And you, what took you so long?

1091
01:34:09,290 --> 01:34:13,727
Your kid was
a tough rundown, Billy.
[Chuckles] Him?

1092
01:34:13,795 --> 01:34:15,558
No.
Yeah, yeah.

1093
01:34:15,630 --> 01:34:18,155
But I did walk him right through
that door, right, just like we agreed?

1094
01:34:18,232 --> 01:34:21,065
You did.
We good?

1095
01:34:21,135 --> 01:34:23,330
We're good.

1096
01:34:23,404 --> 01:34:27,340
250 large.
You got your restaurant, kid.

1097
01:34:27,408 --> 01:34:29,342
Now get out of here.

1098
01:34:31,946 --> 01:34:35,507
Billy, before I leave,
when I was down in Brazil,
they showed me this ritual...

1099
01:34:35,616 --> 01:34:39,017
that they practice when they have
these big celebrations.

1100
01:34:39,087 --> 01:34:41,647
And what they do
is they eat this fruit...

1101
01:34:41,756 --> 01:34:44,691
and it's called konlobos,
with a "K."

1102
01:34:46,260 --> 01:34:50,720
So, I figured before I leave,
we can celebrate one last time.

1103
01:34:50,798 --> 01:34:54,063
Guys, try some of this.
We'll get it over with. lfhe says
it's good, it's gotta be good.

He's the best chef I know.
[Beck]
Billy, here. You try the first piece.

1105
01:34:59,574 --> 01:35:01,371
It's not bad.

1106
01:35:01,476 --> 01:35:04,468
Big seeds, though.
I don't like seeds.

1107
01:35:07,448 --> 01:35:09,643

[Moaning Continues]

1110
01:35:28,336 --> 01:35:30,964
I walked him right through
that door, Billy.

1111
01:35:33,674 --> 01:35:35,574
Mm-hmm.

1112
01:35:36,611 --> 01:35:38,545

1113
01:35:39,781 --> 01:35:41,715
you got a funny-lookin' face.

1114
01:35:41,816 --> 01:35:45,411
Hey, Dad. Whoo!

1115
01:35:47,822 --> 01:35:51,588
I love you, you know that?
Because you showed me something
back there. You did.

1116
01:35:51,659 --> 01:35:55,356
I thought you had character,
but I wasn't sure.

1117
01:35:55,430 --> 01:35:58,365
You got it, man! You really got it!
Get in the truck.

1118
01:35:58,433 --> 01:36:01,402
You pretty much violated
every agricultural law back there.
That's the least of our problems.

1119
01:36:01,502 --> 01:36:05,165
I know. You should go back in there
and finish him off.

1120
01:36:05,206 --> 01:36:08,437
You wanna go back in there?
Go ahead. Knock yourself out.
I'll wait for you right here.

1121
01:36:08,509 --> 01:36:10,739
I'm not going back in there.
Right.

1122
01:36:10,812 --> 01:36:13,713
So, shut up, get in the truck
before I change my mind.

1123
01:36:13,781 --> 01:36:15,749
Don't push me.

1124
01:36:15,817 --> 01:36:18,479
What?
Don't push me.

1125
01:36:18,586 --> 01:36:20,645
I appreciate everything
you did back there.

1126
01:36:20,755 --> 01:36:25,021
But if you wanna get technical about it,
all you really did is even up the score
since I saved your life first.

1127
01:36:25,093 --> 01:36:27,118
Get in the truck.
You don't have to thank me.

1128
01:36:27,195 --> 01:36:30,426
But this pushing shit ain't
happening no more. You read me?

1129
01:36:30,498 --> 01:36:32,489
Uh-uh.

1130
01:36:34,368 --> 01:36:39,101
- Okay. I'm gonna bust you up.
- Go for it.

1131
01:36:39,173 --> 01:36:41,801

Yeah.

Ooh, I know you know him.

don't ya?

1137
01:37:08,769 --> 01:37:11,363
I'm just playing, man.
I'll be in the truck.

1138
01:37:15,309 --> 01:37:17,277
I'm gonna kill you.

What you running from
Who you running to

1141
01:37:30,658 --> 01:37:33,149
Ready to kick some ass
Bring a gun or two

1142
01:37:33,227 --> 01:37:35,889
Get your whole town
It's gonna be the showdown

1143
01:37:35,963 --> 01:37:38,090
And we gonna make the streets smoky
like it was Motown

Come on, come on, come on

I got the temptation
Feeling the sensation

1146

We got our motor running
and I ain't even got my gun

1147

Don't take the third 'cause
I'm prepared to get thejob done

Even if the Mob come
running up in Mach 1

I don't hold no beef with you
'cause I'm a peaceful dude

Don't make me rearrange your face
like a Rubik's Cube

01:37:59,487 --> 01:38:01,785
Don't make me run up in your face
like I was ready to do

Don't bring your ladies into town
Ain't no place safe for you

Don't slow me down now

1156
01:38:20,408 --> 01:38:25,175
Run, run, run, run, run, run

On your marks, set, ready, go
Hands up, here we go

1159
01:38:38,526 --> 01:38:41,051

1164
01:39:03,284 --> 01:39:05,878
I'd rather chill, meditate
and sip this green tea

1165
01:39:05,987 --> 01:39:08,455
I'm hard as a rock
but I don't need a lot of space

You making a scene
Come on, this is not the place

Don't try to escape, run
or skip town, dude

You making it harder
for everyone around you
