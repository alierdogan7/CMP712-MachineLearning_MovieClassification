01:42:51,999 --> 01:42:55,819
Heh, I'm sorry.
He wasn't your friend after all, was he?

1214
01:42:55,919 --> 01:42:57,907
(CHUCKLES)

1215
01:42:59,256 --> 01:43:03,537
I'd like to thank you for killing
all the witnesses against me.

1216
01:43:04,303 --> 01:43:05,746
Not all.

1217
01:43:05,846 --> 01:43:07,873
Not the one who recorded this tape.

1218
01:43:07,973 --> 01:43:10,167
VU (ON TAPE): We didn't kill him
for nothing. Give us the money.

1219
01:43:10,267 --> 01:43:13,798
LEE (ON TAPE): Then it's time to bring
the ship to port and unload our freight.

1220
01:43:14,646 --> 01:43:17,049
One hundred eighty-six
at 40,000 apiece.

1221
01:43:17,149 --> 01:43:19,718
I'd say that's a nice start
to our relationship, wouldn't you?

1222
01:43:19,818 --> 01:43:21,261
VU: Ha, ha. Shit, yeah!

1223
01:43:21,361 --> 01:43:23,013

(MEN CHATTERING AND LAUGHING ON TAPE)

1225
01:43:26,992 --> 01:43:29,812
Let's go, hotshot. You're under arrest.

1226
01:43:29,912 --> 01:43:32,481
You have the right to remain silent.
You understand?

1227
01:43:32,581 --> 01:43:35,317
You have the right to refuse
to answer any questions.

1228
01:43:35,417 --> 01:43:38,904
Anything you say can and will be used
against you in a court of law.

1229
01:43:39,004 --> 01:43:42,326
You have the right
to have an attorney present...
