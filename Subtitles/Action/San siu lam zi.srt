1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000


2
00:01:27,875 --> 00:01:33,166
While the young Republic was in danger
of being invaded by foreign powers,

3
00:01:33,250 --> 00:01:38,624
turf wars raged among warlords, creating
purgatories as their own people suffer...

4
00:01:44,584 --> 00:01:48,958
City of Tengfeng,
Henan, China

5
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:28,124
Buddha be praised.

6
00:03:03,125 --> 00:03:05,291
He's alive!

7
00:03:14,209 --> 00:03:16,874
Hang in there!

8
00:03:19,959 --> 00:03:22,166
Hurry!

9
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:23,624
Go faster!

10
00:03:51,334 --> 00:03:53,249
Kill them all!

11
00:04:26,917 --> 00:04:28,999
For you.

12
00:04:40,667 --> 00:04:44,083
- Here.
- Thank you.

13
00:04:44,167 --> 00:04:48,499
- Another 200 refugees just arrived.
- Winter is almost upon us.

14
00:04:48,584 --> 00:04:50,749
Put up more tents before it snows.

15
00:04:50,834 --> 00:04:54,291
We have run out of materials.
I've nothing to build them with.

16
00:04:54,375 --> 00:04:56,666
Let's move them into our quarters, then.

17
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:59,333
I really hate the cold.

18
00:05:01,042 --> 00:05:04,791
Buns are getting smaller each day.

19
00:05:05,375 --> 00:05:07,291
I wouldn't worry about the cold.

20
00:05:07,375 --> 00:05:11,999
Starvation will have killed us
long before winter arrives!

21
00:05:19,625 --> 00:05:21,708
Shaolin Temple

22
00:05:41,459 --> 00:05:43,374
Search them!

23
00:05:50,542 --> 00:05:51,499
Get out!

24
00:05:54,417 --> 00:05:56,208
Get out! Get out!

25
00:05:58,125 --> 00:06:00,208
Hurry up! Get out!

26
00:06:06,125 --> 00:06:07,583
Get out!

27
00:06:13,417 --> 00:06:15,999
Stand Still! Don't move!

28
00:06:16,084 --> 00:06:18,999
Come here! Stand still!

29
00:06:19,084 --> 00:06:22,416
Don't move! Don't move!

30
00:06:32,709 --> 00:06:41,999
Out of the way!

31
00:06:42,084 --> 00:06:43,124
Stop!

32
00:06:44,667 --> 00:06:47,833
Stay out! Dismount!

33
00:06:52,125 --> 00:06:53,416
Dismount!

34
00:06:57,667 --> 00:06:59,041
The Birthplace of Martial Arts

35
00:07:01,709 --> 00:07:04,083
Help Abbot! Help me. . .

36
00:07:04,167 --> 00:07:05,458
Stupid monks!

37
00:07:05,542 --> 00:07:08,874
I'll kill anyone who harbours our enemies.

38
00:07:08,959 --> 00:07:12,208
I don't care who you are!
Show respect!

39
00:08:07,459 --> 00:08:08,499
Come on!

40
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:13,958
Hey! Hey!

41
00:08:14,042 --> 00:08:15,833
Stop helping him or I'll kill you!

42
00:08:15,917 --> 00:08:17,999
He's lost too much blood.

43
00:08:18,084 --> 00:08:19,999
- Get some medicine.
- Yes, Abbot.

44
00:08:22,625 --> 00:08:24,124
General Hou is here!

45
00:08:42,417 --> 00:08:44,999
They greet you
with Shaolin martial arts.

46
00:08:45,084 --> 00:08:47,458
It's impudent to draw your gun.

47
00:08:49,542 --> 00:08:51,499
General.

48
00:09:10,375 --> 00:09:13,083
- Sir, don't move.
- Nor you, Abbot.

49
00:09:13,167 --> 00:09:14,833
Don't bother.

50
00:09:14,917 --> 00:09:17,624
He is doomed.
Don't waste your time.

51
00:09:17,709 --> 00:09:20,999
Buddha be praised.

52
00:09:21,084 --> 00:09:23,166
Buddha offers sanctuary to all,

53
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:26,416
even one on his very last breath.

54
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:28,791
I must help.

55
00:09:28,875 --> 00:09:33,124
Please show compassion.

56
00:09:33,209 --> 00:09:35,124
No more killing, please.

57
00:09:37,084 --> 00:09:39,499
I can't rest until he dies.

58
00:09:39,584 --> 00:09:43,666
A fearless heart is free of desire,

59
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:46,874
a kind heart finds peace everywhere.

60
00:09:47,375 --> 00:09:49,583
Peace?

61
00:09:49,667 --> 00:09:54,124
You've holed up
in this temple far too long.

62
00:09:54,209 --> 00:09:57,874
If he lives,
the war goes on.

63
00:09:57,959 --> 00:10:01,583
How can we find peace then?

64
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:07,583
Hou Chieh.

65
00:10:07,667 --> 00:10:09,124
I concede.

66
00:10:09,917 --> 00:10:13,333
Tengfeng is yours.

67
00:10:13,417 --> 00:10:16,166
Let me go.

68
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:18,999
I'll give you everything!

69
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:24,916
Here... a treasure map.

70
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:28,541
Take it.

71
00:10:28,625 --> 00:10:31,666
Just spare my life.

72
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:34,458
I promise I won't return.

73
00:11:09,667 --> 00:11:11,083
Thank you.

74
00:11:11,167 --> 00:11:13,083
Abbot...

75
00:11:13,875 --> 00:11:17,749
Sir! Sir!

76
00:11:24,917 --> 00:11:26,749
On guard!

77
00:11:28,875 --> 00:11:31,666
Stop, don't fight!

78
00:11:48,125 --> 00:11:52,499
We come with joy,
depart with sorrow,

79
00:11:52,584 --> 00:11:56,166
to wander among mankind.

80
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:59,041
Without coming or going,

81
00:11:59,125 --> 00:12:02,583
we cause no joy or sorrow.

82
00:12:02,667 --> 00:12:05,083
Buddha be praised.

83
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,083
Let's go!

84
00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:21,166
The Birthplace of Martial Arts
is no big deal.

85
00:13:11,334 --> 00:13:14,749
Please meet the foreigners tomorrow.

86
00:13:14,834 --> 00:13:16,208
Why?

87
00:13:16,292 --> 00:13:19,833
We can buy more guns and cannons.

88
00:13:19,917 --> 00:13:22,499
Let's take Chengchou City, too.

89
00:13:22,584 --> 00:13:25,583
Guns are no good
unless you use them.

90
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:30,041
Why didn't you shoot
in the temple?

91
00:13:32,917 --> 00:13:33,958
Compassion?

92
00:13:36,042 --> 00:13:40,999
Remember,
when you gain the upper hand,

93
00:13:41,084 --> 00:13:44,833
you'll die, if you hesitate too long.

94
00:13:44,917 --> 00:13:49,791
Next time, whoever stands in your way,

95
00:13:49,875 --> 00:13:51,749
I'll kill them all!

96
00:13:53,875 --> 00:13:55,249
Remember that!

97
00:13:58,209 --> 00:14:00,541
Here comes Sung.

98
00:14:00,625 --> 00:14:04,958
- General Sung to you!
- General Sung.

99
00:14:05,042 --> 00:14:07,416
The bastard went AWOL
during the battle.

100
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:10,041
But is first to show up
when sharing the spoils.

101
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,416
Brother,

102
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:21,791
Tengfeng is ours.

103
00:14:21,875 --> 00:14:23,249
Huo is dead.

104
00:14:23,917 --> 00:14:26,249
All this fuss,
just for that Huo?

105
00:14:26,334 --> 00:14:31,166
I thought it might even be your funeral.

106
00:14:33,625 --> 00:14:35,708
We lost hundreds of men.

107
00:14:36,292 --> 00:14:38,124
So?

108
00:14:38,209 --> 00:14:40,666
You want me to pay?

109
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:43,958
You felt abandoned
when I didn't show up?

110
00:14:44,042 --> 00:14:46,166
If I hadn't injured my leg,

111
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:49,958
I could have taken Huo single-handedly.

112
00:14:50,042 --> 00:14:53,749
- Isn't that right, Brother?
- Of course!

113
00:14:53,834 --> 00:14:57,291
I feel sad about our dead comrades.

114
00:14:57,375 --> 00:15:01,749
You only care about Tengfeng!

115
00:15:10,375 --> 00:15:12,541
Madam Hou, it's been a while.

116
00:15:12,625 --> 00:15:15,749
- Sir.
- Nan, my darling!

117
00:15:15,834 --> 00:15:18,708
- Greet Uncle Sung.
- Hello, Uncle Sung.

118
00:15:18,792 --> 00:15:21,083
Good girl.

119
00:15:21,167 --> 00:15:24,374
She has become so smart,
and gorgeous, too.

120
00:15:25,167 --> 00:15:30,083
I can't let someone else take her.

121
00:15:30,667 --> 00:15:33,874
Our children should marry.
It's decided.

122
00:15:33,875 --> 00:15:35,791
They are still young.

123
00:15:36,875 --> 00:15:41,041
- Can't we wait a little longer?
- It's just an arranged marriage.

124
00:15:41,125 --> 00:15:46,166
If you decline,
we can wage war over this!

125
00:16:25,959 --> 00:16:28,999
Great! Awesome!

126
00:16:29,084 --> 00:16:32,083
A fully-automatic Gatling gun.

127
00:16:32,167 --> 00:16:34,791
No one else has them.

128
00:16:35,417 --> 00:16:37,874
I'll take 80.

129
00:16:37,959 --> 00:16:40,291
Your price?

130
00:16:40,375 --> 00:16:43,999
You can have them for free.

131
00:16:46,334 --> 00:16:50,749
Just let us build
a railroad near Tengfeng.

132
00:17:01,834 --> 00:17:04,583
What? I couldn't hear you.

133
00:17:05,542 --> 00:17:09,291
I said, they're free.

134
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:13,458
Just say yes to our railroad plans.

135
00:17:13,542 --> 00:17:15,583
Forget the guns.

136
00:17:15,667 --> 00:17:18,749
- General?
- I don't want them!

137
00:17:25,334 --> 00:17:27,416
Fine,

138
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:29,916
we'll go to General Sung.

139
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:35,333
I'm sure he'd love these.

140
00:17:37,042 --> 00:17:39,708
Sir Peter, please wait.

141
00:17:41,542 --> 00:17:47,041
These are really good guns.
If Sung is armed with them...

142
00:17:53,167 --> 00:17:55,249
- Show the guests out.
- Yes Sir!

143
00:17:55,334 --> 00:17:56,583
This way.

144
00:18:01,959 --> 00:18:05,874
You just don't seem to understand.

145
00:18:05,959 --> 00:18:07,958
You want me to obey you?

146
00:18:08,042 --> 00:18:11,374
Not until our roles are reversed!

147
00:18:11,459 --> 00:18:13,541
Understand?

148
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,083
Did you hear me?

149
00:18:37,167 --> 00:18:40,958
They want to take away
our livelihood!

150
00:18:44,167 --> 00:18:47,749
Endorsing their plans for a railroad

151
00:18:47,834 --> 00:18:50,333
is like leaving our doors open,

152
00:18:50,417 --> 00:18:54,291
for outsiders to ransack our home.

153
00:18:54,375 --> 00:18:56,916
China belongs to the Chinese!

154
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,249
If foreigners want a piece of it,

155
00:19:00,334 --> 00:19:02,291
I'll hack their hands off!

156
00:19:04,959 --> 00:19:07,374
I hope Sung feels the same way.

157
00:19:10,042 --> 00:19:13,041
Have I been talking to a brick wall?

158
00:19:14,042 --> 00:19:18,499
Sung's my only sworn brother.

159
00:19:18,584 --> 00:19:20,749
Don't ever speak ill of him.

160
00:19:27,625 --> 00:19:30,749
You should never speak out of turn.

161
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:36,666
But what you said made sense.

162
00:19:38,209 --> 00:19:39,666
Set up a dinner with Sung.

163
00:19:58,084 --> 00:19:59,583
I'm dizzy.

164
00:20:03,084 --> 00:20:05,208
- What are you chewing?
- Cake.

165
00:20:05,292 --> 00:20:06,333
Cake?

166
00:20:08,292 --> 00:20:10,666
Now I'm eating noodles.

167
00:20:11,792 --> 00:20:17,708
- Hunger has driven you mad!
- It's nourishment through meditation.

168
00:20:17,792 --> 00:20:22,499
Meditate as much as you want.
What about the people?

169
00:20:22,584 --> 00:20:25,166
What can they do?

170
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:28,499
In past famines,
government distributed food.

171
00:20:28,584 --> 00:20:31,083
Or people were fed
by some fabled outlaws.

172
00:20:31,167 --> 00:20:34,833
But now we only have wicked warlords.

173
00:20:34,917 --> 00:20:37,958
Why don't we become outlaws?

174
00:20:39,167 --> 00:20:41,124
What?

175
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:45,124
Yes, benevolent outlaws!

176
00:20:45,209 --> 00:20:48,166
- But it violates our precepts!
- So?

177
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:50,791
Senior Brother will bail us out.

178
00:20:50,875 --> 00:20:53,333
He's very righteous,
isn't he?

179
00:20:54,584 --> 00:20:55,916
Of course!

180
00:20:56,584 --> 00:20:57,666
Of course...

181
00:21:01,292 --> 00:21:02,374
Miss, don't run!

182
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:04,958
- Get up...
- Nan!

183
00:21:05,042 --> 00:21:07,124
Miss, are you hurt?

184
00:21:08,375 --> 00:21:10,041
Are you alright?

185
00:21:10,125 --> 00:21:12,291
You're supposed to look after her.

186
00:21:12,375 --> 00:21:14,291
- I'm sorry...
- How could you let her fall?

187
00:21:14,375 --> 00:21:15,874
- I'm sorry, sir...
- Damn you!

188
00:21:15,959 --> 00:21:17,958
- I'm sorry...
- Daddy...

189
00:21:18,042 --> 00:21:21,124
I'm fine. Don't be mad at Nanny.
I misbehaved.

190
00:21:21,209 --> 00:21:25,499
- I'm very sorry, sir.
- Get out.

191
00:21:26,959 --> 00:21:28,416
- Does it hurt?
- Are you hurt?

192
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:31,249
- No.
- Let me take a look.

193
00:21:31,334 --> 00:21:34,124
I drew this for you.

194
00:21:37,292 --> 00:21:41,124
Daddy loves to fight!

195
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:45,833
This is me?

196
00:21:48,375 --> 00:21:51,541
- Let Daddy hold you.
- Hold on.

197
00:21:51,625 --> 00:21:53,958
Am I so mean?

198
00:21:54,042 --> 00:21:55,083
Boss.

199
00:21:58,667 --> 00:22:02,416
Hold on to it.
Give it back later, or. . .

200
00:22:04,125 --> 00:22:05,166
Let's go.

201
00:22:13,125 --> 00:22:17,208
I handed General Sung your invitation.

202
00:22:17,292 --> 00:22:19,249
He was delighted.

203
00:22:20,042 --> 00:22:22,791
Tomorrow night, Hill Restaurant,

204
00:22:22,875 --> 00:22:26,499
General and Madam Sung will attend.

205
00:22:26,584 --> 00:22:28,374
With their son.

206
00:22:42,459 --> 00:22:44,541
Let me ask you this.

207
00:22:48,250 --> 00:22:50,874
Sung knows I have Huo's hoard.

208
00:22:50,959 --> 00:22:54,041
Why doesn't he ask about it?

209
00:22:59,250 --> 00:23:01,333
He wants it all.

210
00:23:02,542 --> 00:23:04,541
Including what's mine.

211
00:23:10,125 --> 00:23:13,583
It's never wrong to strike first.

212
00:23:14,875 --> 00:23:17,124
This is a great chance.

213
00:23:20,334 --> 00:23:21,458
Yes.

214
00:23:22,250 --> 00:23:26,499
Take 30 crack soldiers to the restaurant.

215
00:23:38,542 --> 00:23:42,791
I can't rest until he's dead.

216
00:23:47,167 --> 00:23:49,249
Brilliant.

217
00:24:00,375 --> 00:24:02,708
Do you want to kill Sung?

218
00:24:07,542 --> 00:24:09,291
Stay out of this.

219
00:24:12,042 --> 00:24:14,999
He's your sworn brother.

220
00:24:15,084 --> 00:24:16,666
Think about it.

221
00:24:19,334 --> 00:24:21,666
He wants to get rid of me.

222
00:24:24,584 --> 00:24:26,791
Do you have a better suggestion?

223
00:24:26,875 --> 00:24:29,499
You had better tell me now.

224
00:24:29,584 --> 00:24:32,249
Don't ask me, I don't know.

225
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:38,333
Just promise me...

226
00:24:41,459 --> 00:24:44,791
Never kill in front of Nan.

227
00:24:44,875 --> 00:24:45,958
Please?

228
00:25:31,250 --> 00:25:32,291
A rat!

229
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:38,541
So we steal flour as well as rice?

230
00:25:38,625 --> 00:25:40,749
We don't steal.

231
00:25:40,834 --> 00:25:42,666
We just take.

232
00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:44,749
How much do we take?

233
00:25:44,834 --> 00:25:47,249
Does it matter?

234
00:25:47,334 --> 00:25:48,624
We take what we can.

235
00:25:48,709 --> 00:25:50,124
Chinghai.

236
00:25:50,209 --> 00:25:52,958
Fabled outlaws always leave a marker.

237
00:25:53,042 --> 00:25:55,541
What shall we leave?

238
00:25:55,625 --> 00:25:57,791
- How about your bald head?
- You...

239
00:26:14,334 --> 00:26:16,916
Get up! It's rice!

240
00:26:17,917 --> 00:26:19,833
Son, it's rice!

241
00:26:19,917 --> 00:26:21,999
Rice!

242
00:26:22,084 --> 00:26:25,208
- Brother, this is rice!
- Thank heavens!

243
00:26:26,459 --> 00:26:28,416
Thank you!

244
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:29,999
Thank you...

245
00:26:30,084 --> 00:26:32,791
It's rice!

246
00:26:57,292 --> 00:27:00,416
What's going on?

247
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:03,999
- Go and take a look.
- Who is he?

248
00:27:28,292 --> 00:27:30,708
When I slap the tabletop,

249
00:27:30,792 --> 00:27:32,791
take Nan to the toilet.

250
00:27:32,875 --> 00:27:37,208
Why do I have to go
to the toilet during dinner?

251
00:27:37,292 --> 00:27:41,833
Do as I say.
I promise I'll never fight again.

252
00:27:55,792 --> 00:27:58,749
Please.
This way, please.

253
00:28:21,584 --> 00:28:24,374
- Brother.
- Madam.

254
00:28:24,459 --> 00:28:26,583
You're late again.

255
00:28:26,667 --> 00:28:28,416
My sincere apologies.
Say hello!

256
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:30,958
Hello, Uncle Sung!
Auntie!

257
00:28:30,959 --> 00:28:33,583
Son, say hello too.

258
00:28:33,667 --> 00:28:35,708
Uncle!
Auntie!

259
00:28:35,792 --> 00:28:40,166
Good boy.

260
00:28:41,125 --> 00:28:43,208
My generals...

261
00:28:44,667 --> 00:28:49,708
Young Master Sung was born a Rabbit,
and young Miss Hou a Ram.

262
00:28:49,709 --> 00:28:51,874
A perfect match!

263
00:28:51,959 --> 00:28:55,499
Their birthdays and birth signs
compliment each other.

264
00:28:55,584 --> 00:28:58,624
A heavenly couple!

265
00:28:58,709 --> 00:29:03,249
This marriage will bring great riches

266
00:29:03,334 --> 00:29:07,999
and a long and happy life,
with many offspring!

267
00:29:09,209 --> 00:29:10,583
Well said!

268
00:29:10,667 --> 00:29:15,208
To us Buddhists, affinity is karma,

269
00:29:15,292 --> 00:29:17,374
without which we'd never meet.

270
00:29:18,125 --> 00:29:22,124
I think this young couple
is destined to be together.

271
00:29:22,209 --> 00:29:25,874
What are we waiting for?
The Proposals...

272
00:29:26,625 --> 00:29:29,833
- What's the hurry?
- I can't wait.

273
00:29:29,917 --> 00:29:34,499
If we miss out on this daughter-in-law,
where would I find another?

274
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:38,291
Once you exchange proposals,
this marriage is set.

275
00:29:38,375 --> 00:29:40,499
This is it.

276
00:29:41,375 --> 00:29:42,916
Come.

277
00:29:44,292 --> 00:29:46,458
Congratulations!

278
00:29:46,542 --> 00:29:48,833
I'll go and bring the gifts.

279
00:30:09,709 --> 00:30:14,583
Now that we're family,

280
00:30:14,667 --> 00:30:17,208
I'll not mince words.

281
00:30:18,209 --> 00:30:19,833
Go ahead.

282
00:30:21,292 --> 00:30:24,874
The city of Tengfeng that you captured,

283
00:30:24,959 --> 00:30:27,999
how should we carve it up?

284
00:30:28,084 --> 00:30:29,958
Tell me.

285
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:42,041
Didn't we agree on equal shares?

286
00:30:44,375 --> 00:30:46,083
It's all yours!

287
00:30:47,042 --> 00:30:51,666
From now on,
there's no need to share.

288
00:30:51,750 --> 00:30:53,374
You can have it all.

289
00:30:54,084 --> 00:30:56,791
Then there will be peace.

290
00:30:59,750 --> 00:31:01,791
What do you mean?

291
00:31:01,875 --> 00:31:05,458
I'm getting old.

292
00:31:05,542 --> 00:31:07,916
I can't fight any more.

293
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,458
Look, I am even a cripple.

294
00:31:10,542 --> 00:31:12,916
It's time for me to quit.

295
00:31:14,375 --> 00:31:17,499
Since we're now in-laws,

296
00:31:17,584 --> 00:31:23,166
what I let you take,
you'll one day leave to my son!

297
00:31:23,250 --> 00:31:27,541
I have this all worked out!

298
00:31:28,459 --> 00:31:31,874
I've kept this bottle for years,
never had a chance to drink it.

299
00:31:31,959 --> 00:31:34,708
Come, let's toast.

300
00:31:34,792 --> 00:31:37,291
To our deal!

301
00:31:41,042 --> 00:31:43,166
A confidential note, sir!

302
00:32:02,834 --> 00:32:05,583
Son, do you need to pee?

303
00:32:05,667 --> 00:32:07,458
No.

304
00:32:07,542 --> 00:32:10,583
Be good,
go with your mother.

305
00:32:12,334 --> 00:32:15,333
Madam, take Nan, too.

306
00:32:18,209 --> 00:32:19,666
Let's go.

307
00:32:25,167 --> 00:32:26,208
Go!

308
00:32:35,125 --> 00:32:36,416
- Captain Wang.
- Yes, sir!

309
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:38,791
- You go, too.
- Yes, sir!

310
00:33:04,459 --> 00:33:08,416
Beware of Hou Chieh's ambush!

311
00:33:11,917 --> 00:33:12,958
You!

312
00:33:13,250 --> 00:33:14,291
You...

313
00:33:14,375 --> 00:33:16,458
You bastard!

314
00:33:17,417 --> 00:33:19,958
I treated you as my own brother.

315
00:33:20,542 --> 00:33:24,333
We went through hell together.
And now you want to kill me.

316
00:33:24,417 --> 00:33:27,124
- Can this be true?
- That's enough!

317
00:33:51,209 --> 00:33:53,041
- Nan!
- Mummy!

318
00:33:53,125 --> 00:33:55,583
Come here, Mummy!

319
00:34:20,417 --> 00:34:22,333
Run!

320
00:34:47,084 --> 00:34:48,666
Help me, Mummy!

321
00:34:50,459 --> 00:34:51,499
Run!

322
00:34:55,959 --> 00:35:10,833
Mummy...

323
00:35:11,584 --> 00:35:13,208
Nan, run...

324
00:35:13,292 --> 00:35:15,833
- Mummy...
- Run Nan, run...

325
00:35:15,917 --> 00:35:19,416
Run, Nan,
don't turn back!

326
00:35:20,250 --> 00:35:22,583
Run and hide!

327
00:35:53,667 --> 00:35:55,374
Nan!

328
00:36:55,250 --> 00:36:56,458
General!

329
00:36:59,667 --> 00:37:00,916
Don't let her escape!

330
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,666
Mummy!

331
00:37:02,750 --> 00:37:04,583
- Mummy!
- Nan!

332
00:37:06,292 --> 00:37:07,333
Stop!

333
00:37:16,959 --> 00:37:19,416
Run! Run!

334
00:37:29,834 --> 00:37:30,874
Nan!

335
00:37:50,167 --> 00:37:51,583
- Nan.
- Daddy.

336
00:37:53,084 --> 00:37:54,291
Over there!

337
00:39:10,417 --> 00:39:11,958
Be brave, Nan!

338
00:40:04,167 --> 00:40:14,374
Daddy...

339
00:40:15,792 --> 00:40:17,499
Nan!

340
00:42:34,042 --> 00:42:35,999
Abbot!

341
00:42:36,084 --> 00:42:38,666
Sir. Please stop!

342
00:42:39,750 --> 00:42:40,874
Help!

343
00:42:40,959 --> 00:42:42,249
Abbot! Help!

344
00:42:42,334 --> 00:42:44,166
Help her please!

345
00:42:45,875 --> 00:42:47,833
Help her!

346
00:42:47,917 --> 00:42:49,874
Out of the way!

347
00:42:54,959 --> 00:42:57,333
- Needles, ointment and hot water!
- Yes, sir!

348
00:42:57,417 --> 00:42:58,458
Help her!

349
00:43:05,917 --> 00:43:07,958
Hang in there, you'll be fine.

350
00:43:09,750 --> 00:43:11,249
Don't fall asleep.

351
00:43:11,334 --> 00:43:12,958
Madam!

352
00:43:13,959 --> 00:43:17,249
Easy, Madam!
You haven't recovered.

353
00:43:17,334 --> 00:43:18,458
Be careful!

354
00:43:20,292 --> 00:43:21,583
Nan!

355
00:43:21,667 --> 00:43:24,249
My darling girl, hang in there...

356
00:43:46,917 --> 00:43:48,166
Nan!

357
00:43:49,792 --> 00:43:53,624
Talk to Daddy.
Nan, talk to Daddy...

358
00:43:54,542 --> 00:43:58,333
Say something to me...

359
00:44:01,292 --> 00:44:03,666
Why did you stop?
Why did you stop?

360
00:44:03,750 --> 00:44:05,541
Help her!

361
00:44:05,625 --> 00:44:08,208
You want me to beg?

362
00:44:08,292 --> 00:44:11,583
Then I will, please help her!

363
00:44:11,584 --> 00:44:15,333
Daddy, I'm fine.

364
00:44:15,417 --> 00:44:20,541
Don't yell at them.
Don't be mad.

365
00:44:20,625 --> 00:44:23,499
I won't. I won't be mad at them...

366
00:44:24,584 --> 00:44:26,166
- Please...
- Nan!

367
00:44:26,167 --> 00:44:27,291
- Please save her...
- Nan!

368
00:44:27,375 --> 00:44:29,666
- Mummy...
- Nan!

369
00:44:29,750 --> 00:44:33,124
She'll be fine...
She's going to live.

370
00:44:33,209 --> 00:44:35,416
Mummy, I missed you...

371
00:44:35,500 --> 00:44:41,249
Let's go home...
Daddy, don't be mad.

372
00:44:42,334 --> 00:44:44,624
Mummy will take you home.

373
00:44:44,709 --> 00:44:46,458
Please help her.

374
00:44:46,542 --> 00:44:48,041
I beg you!

375
00:44:49,292 --> 00:44:51,791
Please help her.
I beg you!

376
00:44:51,875 --> 00:44:54,958
Wake up, Nan.
Say something to Mummy...

377
00:44:55,042 --> 00:45:04,499
Nan!

378
00:45:06,709 --> 00:45:08,458
She's fine...

379
00:45:09,667 --> 00:45:10,958
Say something to Daddy...

380
00:45:11,042 --> 00:45:12,541
- She's fine...
- Nan!

381
00:45:12,625 --> 00:45:14,708
Nan is not going to die...

382
00:45:15,500 --> 00:45:18,249
Nan!

383
00:45:20,334 --> 00:45:24,499
Wake up, don't...
Come on, Nan.

384
00:45:24,500 --> 00:45:26,624
Mummy is here, look at me.

385
00:45:26,709 --> 00:45:29,624
Cleanse her body, Chinghai.

386
00:45:29,709 --> 00:45:31,541
She's still alive!

387
00:45:31,625 --> 00:45:34,208
Please help her,
I beg you...

388
00:45:34,292 --> 00:45:37,124
I beg you...
Please, help her...

389
00:45:41,875 --> 00:45:44,583
Please show sympathy.

390
00:45:47,542 --> 00:45:49,791
She mustn't die. . . . I'm warning you...

391
00:45:51,084 --> 00:45:53,541
If my daughter dies,

392
00:45:53,625 --> 00:45:55,458
you'll all die with her!

393
00:45:55,542 --> 00:45:57,833
- Please help her...
- That's enough!

394
00:45:57,834 --> 00:45:59,624
Buddha be praised.

395
00:45:59,709 --> 00:46:03,458
Can't you see?
This is your retribution.

396
00:46:03,542 --> 00:46:04,583
It's your fault!

397
00:46:05,542 --> 00:46:06,874
She isn't dead!

398
00:46:06,959 --> 00:46:09,208
I regret...

399
00:46:09,292 --> 00:46:10,583
She really is alive!

400
00:46:10,667 --> 00:46:12,333
- If it wasn't for you...
- She's alive...

401
00:46:12,417 --> 00:46:15,041
- My daughter wouldn't have died.
- She's alive...

402
00:46:15,125 --> 00:46:17,374
- Look! She's dead!
- No...

403
00:46:17,459 --> 00:46:18,749
If it wasn't for you...

404
00:46:18,834 --> 00:46:20,958
- She's dead!
- My Nan isn't going to die!

405
00:46:21,042 --> 00:46:22,666
Damn you!

406
00:46:27,209 --> 00:46:30,249
Nan...

407
00:46:32,917 --> 00:46:35,541
I am sorry...

408
00:46:36,459 --> 00:46:37,666
She's dead!

409
00:46:38,709 --> 00:46:40,124
It's my fault!

410
00:46:40,542 --> 00:46:43,499
She's dead,
are you happy now?

411
00:46:43,584 --> 00:46:46,166
You're faking compassion!

412
00:46:46,250 --> 00:46:48,083
You refused to save her...

413
00:46:48,167 --> 00:46:51,083
I'll kill you all!

414
00:46:51,167 --> 00:46:53,041
I'll start with you, old man!

415
00:46:56,500 --> 00:46:59,166
- Sir...
- I will kill you...

416
00:46:59,250 --> 00:47:01,999
- I will kill you!
- Sir...

417
00:47:05,542 --> 00:47:08,374
- I will kill you...
- Sir...

418
00:47:09,709 --> 00:47:10,749
Form!

419
00:47:24,542 --> 00:47:26,374
I'll kill you!

420
00:47:36,459 --> 00:47:38,583
I'll kill you...

421
00:49:09,209 --> 00:49:11,458
To leave or to stay in Shaolin...

422
00:49:12,292 --> 00:49:24,499
To leave or stay...

423
00:49:26,042 --> 00:49:27,708
To leave...

424
00:49:30,125 --> 00:49:32,333
That one doesn't count.

425
00:49:32,417 --> 00:49:37,916
To leave or stay...

426
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:39,708
- To leave or stay...
- Anyone there?

427
00:49:50,292 --> 00:49:52,916
I hunt a boar, but caught a man!

428
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,083
What has happened to you?

429
00:49:56,709 --> 00:49:59,499
I know you,
you're Hou Chieh.

430
00:49:59,500 --> 00:50:01,708
You still want to kill?

431
00:50:01,792 --> 00:50:04,249
Men when muddled
are worse than pigs!

432
00:50:04,334 --> 00:50:06,208
Rest well while you're down there.

433
00:50:06,292 --> 00:50:07,708
Stop howling, though.

434
00:50:07,792 --> 00:50:10,249
Take some time
to come to your senses.

435
00:50:10,334 --> 00:50:11,999
I'll be back.

436
00:50:14,459 --> 00:50:16,374
Buddha be praised.

437
00:50:36,834 --> 00:50:38,916
WANTED

438
00:50:40,292 --> 00:50:43,416
for treason and murder.
A $50,000 bounty.

439
00:51:02,500 --> 00:51:04,249
Something to eat.

440
00:51:04,334 --> 00:51:06,291
Careful, it's hot.

441
00:51:07,625 --> 00:51:10,291
Don't choke on it.

442
00:51:23,500 --> 00:51:28,749
Why?

443
00:51:40,667 --> 00:51:42,624
Your wife has left Shaolin

444
00:51:42,625 --> 00:51:45,333
without arranging
your daughter's funeral.

445
00:52:11,250 --> 00:52:12,624
Burial or cremation?

446
00:52:16,959 --> 00:52:19,249
Abbot said to ask.

447
00:52:19,334 --> 00:52:24,624
You can visit
her grave if it's a burial.

448
00:52:24,709 --> 00:52:29,083
Since you don't live in Shaolin,
it can be inconvenient.

449
00:52:29,167 --> 00:52:33,083
Cremation is a lot simpler.

450
00:52:33,167 --> 00:52:36,083
At least you could take her with you

451
00:52:36,167 --> 00:52:38,458
and keep her company
wherever you go.

452
00:52:38,542 --> 00:52:40,499
So l think cremation is better.

453
00:52:40,584 --> 00:52:42,124
What do you think?

454
00:52:50,875 --> 00:52:53,291
lf you choose cremation,

455
00:52:53,375 --> 00:52:55,958
go light the bonfire.

456
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:19,499
Burn these!

457
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:33,916
You will die for your beliefs?

458
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:37,458
I'll rejoin Boss
in the netherworld!

459
00:53:38,792 --> 00:53:40,291
Fire!

460
00:53:41,709 --> 00:53:44,041
When you were down and out,

461
00:53:44,125 --> 00:53:45,958
Boss saved your life.

462
00:53:46,917 --> 00:53:49,124
Is this how

463
00:53:49,209 --> 00:53:51,749
you show your gratitude?

464
00:53:52,917 --> 00:53:54,499
Gratitude?

465
00:53:58,292 --> 00:54:00,124
He didn't save me.

466
00:54:00,209 --> 00:54:01,666
He exploited me.

467
00:54:02,917 --> 00:54:06,083
He knows my strength.
He needed me.

468
00:54:07,042 --> 00:54:10,249
I killed the most men
in every battle.

469
00:54:10,334 --> 00:54:13,208
I helped him take all his land.

470
00:54:14,125 --> 00:54:16,249
Know why I got rid of him?

471
00:54:17,709 --> 00:54:19,791
You live if you answer correctly.

472
00:54:20,959 --> 00:54:22,458
It's because...

473
00:54:23,417 --> 00:54:25,541
you're a dog!

474
00:54:31,584 --> 00:54:32,708
Wrong.

475
00:54:41,542 --> 00:54:44,916
Fear had caught up with him!

476
00:54:46,417 --> 00:54:50,166
Once he lost his nerve,
he had to go.

477
00:54:50,250 --> 00:54:52,333
He got what he deserved.

478
00:54:53,584 --> 00:54:56,208
My time has come!

479
00:54:56,292 --> 00:54:57,833
Understand?

480
00:55:11,375 --> 00:55:14,958
Daddy likes to fight!

481
00:55:23,709 --> 00:55:25,541
It's chaos!

482
00:55:26,250 --> 00:55:27,874
There are mass arrests.

483
00:55:29,334 --> 00:55:32,291
Doesn't matter who turns you in.

484
00:55:32,375 --> 00:55:35,166
I've cooked for you, too.

485
00:55:35,250 --> 00:55:36,333
Perhaps...

486
00:55:37,084 --> 00:55:38,541
I deserve the $50,000!

487
00:55:38,625 --> 00:55:40,791
Bounty: $100,000.

488
00:55:40,875 --> 00:55:43,624
When did it become $100,000?

489
00:55:45,542 --> 00:55:46,958
Just teasing you.

490
00:55:47,042 --> 00:55:49,749
I won't betray Shaolin's principles.

491
00:55:51,875 --> 00:55:52,999
What's next for you?

492
00:55:56,167 --> 00:55:57,208
I want to stay.

493
00:55:58,750 --> 00:56:01,499
This is not your home.

494
00:56:29,209 --> 00:56:30,374
What?

495
00:56:31,417 --> 00:56:32,874
Are you angry with me?

496
00:56:32,959 --> 00:56:35,041
Or with yourself?

497
00:57:33,792 --> 00:57:35,916
Need some help?

498
00:57:38,334 --> 00:57:40,416
- Senior Brother!
- Senior Brother!

499
00:57:46,250 --> 00:57:49,916
Our kitchen is over-stocked with rice.
What happened?

500
00:57:51,334 --> 00:57:52,833
Rice?

501
00:57:57,834 --> 00:57:59,833
It must be a miracle!

502
00:58:00,709 --> 00:58:02,999
Buddha be praised.

503
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:11,166
Please consult Buddha
about last night's masked marauders.

504
00:58:11,250 --> 00:58:12,999
Masked marauders?

505
00:58:13,875 --> 00:58:15,749
How come?

506
00:58:15,834 --> 00:58:18,083
They came to steal our rice.

507
00:58:18,167 --> 00:58:21,083
No, they brought stolen rice.

508
00:58:28,167 --> 00:58:30,958
Thieves will be punished
after morning prayers!

509
00:58:30,959 --> 00:58:33,249
Yes, Senior Brother!

510
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:48,624
It's you again!

511
00:58:50,750 --> 00:58:52,374
What do you want?

512
00:58:52,459 --> 00:58:54,541
Buddha be praised.

513
00:58:54,625 --> 00:58:56,666
Abbot!

514
00:59:00,375 --> 00:59:03,291
Abbot,
I wish to stay here.

515
00:59:03,375 --> 00:59:04,874
It's not up to you.

516
00:59:04,959 --> 00:59:08,541
You're a wanted man.
You just want to seek sanctuary.

517
00:59:11,250 --> 00:59:12,624
I want to be a monk.

518
00:59:13,167 --> 00:59:16,916
Shaolin is not a battlefield.
It's not your decision.

519
00:59:17,834 --> 00:59:19,249
Go back to where you belong.

520
00:59:20,125 --> 00:59:24,124
Doesn't Buddha guide
those who come?

521
00:59:24,209 --> 00:59:25,666
Not you.

522
00:59:26,917 --> 00:59:27,958
Abbot!

523
00:59:30,250 --> 00:59:33,749
You can tame his body,
but not his spirit.

524
00:59:34,250 --> 00:59:37,416
He's a warlord.
He is sinful!

525
00:59:37,500 --> 00:59:40,208
He'd only sully our Shaolin Temple.

526
00:59:41,375 --> 00:59:44,916
Every being carries Buddha's spirit.

527
00:59:44,917 --> 00:59:49,083
We shouldn't discriminate.

528
00:59:49,167 --> 00:59:51,999
All teachings are void
but for karma.

529
00:59:52,084 --> 00:59:53,624
There's hatred in him.

530
00:59:53,709 --> 00:59:55,958
He'll never attain zen.

531
00:59:57,167 --> 00:59:58,874
You're right.

532
00:59:58,959 --> 01:00:03,916
But we mustn't close
our doors on Buddha,

533
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:06,124
nor can we.

534
01:00:06,209 --> 01:00:08,208
Afflictions lead to wisdom.

535
01:00:08,292 --> 01:00:10,499
If he's confused,

536
01:00:10,584 --> 01:00:13,374
he may be close to enlightenment.

537
01:00:13,459 --> 01:00:17,499
Let him stay for now.

538
01:00:23,084 --> 01:00:26,499
You've been assigned to me again.

539
01:00:26,584 --> 01:00:28,166
It's better to remain here.

540
01:00:28,250 --> 01:00:32,208
Outside, it's either kill or be killed.
Wait outside.

541
01:00:33,875 --> 01:00:36,541
It's cold. Put this on.

542
01:00:36,625 --> 01:00:38,708
Get to work!

543
01:00:44,959 --> 01:00:47,041
- Buddha be praised.
- Morning.

544
01:00:49,500 --> 01:00:53,999
The Birthplace of Martial Arts
is no big deal.

545
01:00:56,875 --> 01:00:58,958
- Here are the buns.
- Out of the way.

546
01:00:59,209 --> 01:01:01,833
- Here are the buns.
- Out of the way

547
01:01:03,334 --> 01:01:05,916
Line up, everyone.

548
01:01:07,625 --> 01:01:09,083
Over there.

549
01:01:17,792 --> 01:01:19,583
Thank you.

550
01:01:20,500 --> 01:01:21,749
Was that so hard?

551
01:01:24,500 --> 01:01:25,791
No.

552
01:01:26,125 --> 01:01:28,208
Don't push, there's plenty.

553
01:01:37,917 --> 01:01:40,291
Hands fast and unseen!

554
01:01:44,875 --> 01:01:46,791
Train in its way!

555
01:01:47,667 --> 01:01:49,083
Move in its cycle!

556
01:01:49,167 --> 01:01:50,833
Dance in its passion!

557
01:01:50,917 --> 01:01:52,624
Learn its wonder!

558
01:01:52,709 --> 01:01:53,958
Awaken in its spirit!

559
01:03:01,792 --> 01:03:05,124
- Bring me the serving tub.
- Sure.

560
01:03:26,334 --> 01:03:27,833
- Uncle Wudao.
- Yes.

561
01:03:27,917 --> 01:03:30,166
- Were you trained...
- What?

562
01:03:30,250 --> 01:03:32,624
- In martial arts?
- In martial arts?

563
01:03:32,709 --> 01:03:36,583
Yes, ages ago
for a couple of years.

564
01:03:36,667 --> 01:03:40,124
But like you,
my heart was impure.

565
01:03:41,084 --> 01:03:42,374
So I became a cook.

566
01:03:44,584 --> 01:03:47,624
We should learn from Dharma.

567
01:03:48,625 --> 01:03:49,833
He meditated...

568
01:03:51,375 --> 01:03:54,333
...by facing a wall for 9 years.

569
01:03:54,417 --> 01:03:56,499
He trained his heart.

570
01:03:56,584 --> 01:03:58,416
He never fought.

571
01:03:59,209 --> 01:04:00,833
There is wisdom all over him.

572
01:04:00,917 --> 01:04:04,124
Even his hair is wiser than us.

573
01:04:04,209 --> 01:04:07,041
That state of mind
is Martial Zen!

574
01:05:33,334 --> 01:05:34,791
Train with us.

575
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:39,249
Fists to heart!

576
01:05:41,709 --> 01:05:43,374
Elbows to knees!

577
01:05:45,709 --> 01:05:47,374
Shoulders to groin!

578
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:50,749
Heart to mind!

579
01:05:51,500 --> 01:05:52,708
Mind to breath!

580
01:05:53,959 --> 01:05:55,208
Breath to strength!

581
01:05:56,125 --> 01:05:57,249
Train in its way!

582
01:05:58,417 --> 01:05:59,666
Move in its cycle!

583
01:06:00,625 --> 01:06:02,374
Dance in its passion!

584
01:06:03,125 --> 01:06:04,166
Learn its wonder!

585
01:06:05,959 --> 01:06:08,083
Awaken in its spirit!

586
01:06:10,417 --> 01:06:12,791
Keep it up, Brothers!

587
01:06:12,875 --> 01:06:15,458
I used to be able to do that.

588
01:06:15,542 --> 01:06:16,749
Keep it up!

589
01:06:31,834 --> 01:06:33,541
Press his meridian.

590
01:06:35,459 --> 01:06:36,499
You'll be fine.

591
01:06:50,084 --> 01:06:52,166
Go! You!

592
01:06:53,334 --> 01:06:54,583
Here.

593
01:08:00,667 --> 01:08:03,458
It's so cold,
why are you still training?

594
01:08:03,542 --> 01:08:05,916
I train because of the cold.

595
01:08:06,917 --> 01:08:09,333
Aren't you cold?

596
01:08:09,417 --> 01:08:10,666
A little...

597
01:08:10,750 --> 01:08:12,833
Then train with me.

598
01:08:14,750 --> 01:08:15,791
Sure.

599
01:09:11,750 --> 01:09:14,999
Abbot, how do you rate him?

600
01:09:16,459 --> 01:09:18,541
His moves come from his heart.

601
01:09:18,625 --> 01:09:20,833
They are so free.

602
01:09:22,292 --> 01:09:24,249
Through martial zen,

603
01:09:26,042 --> 01:09:31,499
he has released his hatred.

604
01:09:31,584 --> 01:09:34,791
I don't do martial arts.
It's beyond me...

605
01:09:34,875 --> 01:09:38,833
Cooking is also
a way to enlightenment.

606
01:09:39,667 --> 01:09:41,749
Same principle.

607
01:09:43,084 --> 01:09:47,958
Life is an accumulation of experiences.

608
01:09:48,917 --> 01:09:50,999
I have often said,

609
01:09:51,084 --> 01:09:54,374
leave the Temple,
go see the world!

610
01:09:54,917 --> 01:09:58,666
All I can do is cook.
I'd be useless out there.

611
01:09:58,750 --> 01:09:59,916
Forget it.

612
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:05,499
A piece of gold, a pile of mud.
Which is more useful?

613
01:10:05,584 --> 01:10:08,208
- The gold, of course.
- But to a seed?

614
01:10:10,334 --> 01:10:13,208
Never under estimate yourself.

615
01:10:13,292 --> 01:10:17,041
Everyone has a purpose.

616
01:10:51,375 --> 01:10:55,999
Tsao, you want us
to endorse the railroad.

617
01:10:56,084 --> 01:11:00,083
But it will disrupt
our ancestral geomancy

618
01:11:00,167 --> 01:11:03,749
once they start
digging up Mount Mang.

619
01:11:03,834 --> 01:11:06,333
Our ancestors won't allow it!

620
01:11:08,250 --> 01:11:11,749
I'm fine if they're
really building a railroad.

621
01:11:11,834 --> 01:11:14,999
But I'm worried
about these foreigners.

622
01:11:15,084 --> 01:11:17,541
Perhaps they have
a hidden agenda.

623
01:11:20,917 --> 01:11:26,999
How you managed to get rid of Hou
is none of our business.

624
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:30,583
Hou said the railroad
was only an excuse.

625
01:11:30,667 --> 01:11:33,124
Foreigners are really after our land.

626
01:11:33,209 --> 01:11:34,416
That's enough.

627
01:11:34,500 --> 01:11:39,291
The fate of our province
shouldn't be decided by one man.

628
01:11:39,375 --> 01:11:42,624
Tsao has already done deals
with the foreigners.

629
01:11:43,250 --> 01:11:46,291
He never intends to listen to us.

630
01:11:47,584 --> 01:11:48,624
Let's go!

631
01:12:18,042 --> 01:12:20,041
Like l said,

632
01:12:20,125 --> 01:12:21,708
there's no point...

633
01:12:22,625 --> 01:12:24,291
...in opposing me.

634
01:12:25,625 --> 01:12:27,374
He's lucky!

635
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:31,208
His family will suffer even more!

636
01:12:32,834 --> 01:12:34,916
Be my friend or foe.

637
01:12:37,125 --> 01:12:38,749
It's your choice.

638
01:12:43,417 --> 01:12:45,541
l promise you,

639
01:12:45,625 --> 01:12:48,833
when l make money,
we all profit.

640
01:12:58,542 --> 01:13:00,874
What shall I do?

641
01:13:00,959 --> 01:13:03,499
He hasn't come home.
I'm so worried.

642
01:13:06,625 --> 01:13:08,874
Please don't cry.

643
01:13:08,959 --> 01:13:10,791
He's still not home,

644
01:13:12,375 --> 01:13:15,083
- I'm so worried.
- Crying doesn't help.

645
01:13:15,167 --> 01:13:16,208
What happened?

646
01:13:17,084 --> 01:13:20,874
My son hasn't been home for weeks.

647
01:13:22,084 --> 01:13:23,374
What can I do?

648
01:13:23,459 --> 01:13:24,916
Railroad workers wanted:
Men, 16 to 40, $1 a day!

649
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:29,166
- Building railroads for Tsao?
- Our whole family relies on him!

650
01:13:38,375 --> 01:13:39,458
Work harder!

651
01:13:39,542 --> 01:13:41,291
Go to hell!

652
01:13:41,375 --> 01:13:44,124
Can't you hear me?

653
01:13:44,209 --> 01:13:45,666
Hurry up!

654
01:14:16,209 --> 01:14:17,833
Who's there?

655
01:14:18,875 --> 01:14:20,708
What are you doing?

656
01:14:23,042 --> 01:14:24,083
General Hou?

657
01:14:25,250 --> 01:14:26,958
Why were all those men killed?

658
01:14:28,209 --> 01:14:29,999
We're following Tsao's order.

659
01:14:31,542 --> 01:14:35,124
Go!

660
01:14:35,875 --> 01:14:38,333
Hou Chieh is alive!
Hou Chieh is alive!

661
01:14:50,584 --> 01:14:51,708
Run!

662
01:14:57,084 --> 01:14:58,874
Tsao hired us to build railroads,

663
01:14:59,834 --> 01:15:03,291
but made us dig up relics instead.

664
01:15:03,375 --> 01:15:06,083
The relics are given to foreigners,

665
01:15:07,084 --> 01:15:09,958
in return for guns and ammunition.

666
01:15:10,042 --> 01:15:13,124
Tsao keeps it secret by killing us.

667
01:15:27,209 --> 01:15:29,166
Others are still trapped at his house.

668
01:15:29,250 --> 01:15:31,791
They'll all be killed by tomorrow.

669
01:15:36,209 --> 01:15:37,833
I'm sorry.

670
01:15:39,750 --> 01:15:40,916
Go home.

671
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:42,749
Let's go.

672
01:16:31,417 --> 01:16:34,583
Da Niu. . .

673
01:16:34,667 --> 01:16:35,999
My son!

674
01:16:36,084 --> 01:16:38,541
- What is it?
- Let's go and see.

675
01:16:40,209 --> 01:16:45,083
My son...

676
01:17:25,125 --> 01:17:28,291
All negative deeds

677
01:17:29,500 --> 01:17:33,833
are done for greed.

678
01:17:35,209 --> 01:17:38,999
Carried out by our actions,

679
01:17:39,084 --> 01:17:42,833
I now repent before Buddha.

680
01:17:43,709 --> 01:17:46,458
From evil comes afflictions...

681
01:17:47,459 --> 01:17:48,624
Enough!

682
01:17:50,417 --> 01:17:53,749
...with justice they are gone.

683
01:17:56,334 --> 01:17:57,541
Nan!

684
01:17:57,625 --> 01:18:00,208
lf neither are there...

685
01:18:00,292 --> 01:18:03,374
If it wasn't for you
our daughter would be alive!

686
01:18:04,084 --> 01:18:07,999
...you're so purified nothing remains.

687
01:18:14,584 --> 01:18:17,416
Understanding how to let go,

688
01:18:17,500 --> 01:18:20,249
is knowing how to confront all.

689
01:18:20,959 --> 01:18:23,291
From now,
follow the three principles:

690
01:18:24,459 --> 01:18:28,458
Buddha for enlightenment,

691
01:18:28,542 --> 01:18:33,166
Dharma for teachings,

692
01:18:34,209 --> 01:18:36,916
and Sanghi for community.

693
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:41,041
Your religious name

694
01:18:41,125 --> 01:18:43,624
is Chingchueh.

695
01:18:44,334 --> 01:18:49,708
Buddha be praised.

696
01:19:05,125 --> 01:19:07,749
Capture Hou alive!

697
01:19:07,834 --> 01:19:08,874
Move!

698
01:19:45,542 --> 01:19:48,291
It's Tsao!
I'll get him!

699
01:19:48,375 --> 01:19:51,333
Come back!
Sit down!

700
01:19:51,417 --> 01:19:53,624
Stay calm.

701
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:57,874
Perfect timing.

702
01:19:59,209 --> 01:20:03,333
Go and distract Tsao's guards
at his residence.

703
01:20:03,417 --> 01:20:06,499
Our rescue mission is more vital.

704
01:20:06,584 --> 01:20:10,291
How can you survive this?

705
01:20:10,375 --> 01:20:13,708
If I can trade my life for theirs,

706
01:20:13,792 --> 01:20:15,374
it is well worth it.

707
01:20:16,084 --> 01:20:19,416
Please be careful.

708
01:20:43,875 --> 01:21:06,083
Stop there!

709
01:21:06,709 --> 01:21:07,749
Stop!

710
01:21:15,042 --> 01:21:18,249
Buddha be praised.

711
01:21:35,625 --> 01:21:38,791
Please stop your killing.

712
01:21:38,875 --> 01:21:41,916
Evil deeds only bring
bad outcomes.

713
01:21:54,084 --> 01:21:56,708
That was for my daughter.

714
01:21:56,792 --> 01:21:58,583
Buddha be praised.

715
01:21:58,667 --> 01:22:00,749
It truly is you.

716
01:22:02,417 --> 01:22:05,499
I knew you wouldn't die so easily.

717
01:22:06,792 --> 01:22:10,208
I missed you to death!

718
01:22:12,167 --> 01:22:13,458
Really?

719
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:18,749
- You can't rest until I die, can you?
- Nonsense!

720
01:22:19,917 --> 01:22:21,874
Of course not.

721
01:22:24,959 --> 01:22:26,624
Stop pretending.

722
01:22:27,667 --> 01:22:30,374
You're afraid
I'll take your things.

723
01:22:42,167 --> 01:22:46,041
He's doing this to buy us time
so we can rescue the others.

724
01:22:46,125 --> 01:22:49,291
Rashness will only ruin it all.
Understand?

725
01:23:01,042 --> 01:23:03,083
You taught me,

726
01:23:03,167 --> 01:23:07,541
never hesitate
when I gain the upper hand.

727
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:10,999
I learnt well!

728
01:23:16,792 --> 01:23:19,249
You can kill me,

729
01:23:19,334 --> 01:23:21,749
but spare Shaolin.

730
01:23:38,584 --> 01:23:39,833
Suspend the Abbot!

731
01:23:40,417 --> 01:23:43,249
One false move and he dies!

732
01:23:43,709 --> 01:23:45,291
It's fine.

733
01:23:45,375 --> 01:23:46,958
Stand down!

734
01:23:56,667 --> 01:23:57,708
Go ahead.

735
01:24:14,625 --> 01:24:15,666
Beautiful.

736
01:24:18,042 --> 01:24:20,958
Make sure to send them away
before dawn.

737
01:24:21,042 --> 01:24:22,041
Don't worry.

738
01:24:22,125 --> 01:24:25,583
With our armed protection,
there won't be any problem.

739
01:24:26,917 --> 01:24:29,291
Be careful!

740
01:24:29,292 --> 01:24:30,333
Let's go!

741
01:24:30,417 --> 01:24:32,583
Get out of the way!

742
01:24:47,209 --> 01:24:48,749
Get down!

743
01:24:50,792 --> 01:24:53,083
Yes, you!

744
01:25:05,292 --> 01:25:08,999
I've made this place a lot nicer.

745
01:25:11,042 --> 01:25:12,708
You didn't bring me here

746
01:25:14,167 --> 01:25:16,374
to praise you.

747
01:25:18,334 --> 01:25:20,333
Certainly not.

748
01:25:20,334 --> 01:25:23,083
I beg you for forgiveness.

749
01:25:24,417 --> 01:25:27,749
I want you
to lead us once more,

750
01:25:28,667 --> 01:25:32,291
do great deeds
and conquer the world.

751
01:25:33,084 --> 01:25:35,374
Look around you.

752
01:25:35,459 --> 01:25:37,791
I made these just for you.

753
01:25:37,875 --> 01:25:39,624
Your throne,

754
01:25:39,709 --> 01:25:41,624
your Imperial robe.

755
01:25:49,250 --> 01:25:51,083
Tsao Man.

756
01:25:52,500 --> 01:25:56,083
Do power and wealth
really mean so much to you?

757
01:26:00,709 --> 01:26:01,749
Listen.

758
01:26:02,959 --> 01:26:04,833
Don't be as ignorant as I was.

759
01:26:09,625 --> 01:26:11,499
False compassion!

760
01:26:13,375 --> 01:26:14,749
I was just teasing you.

761
01:26:17,375 --> 01:26:19,374
Let's see what you'll do!

762
01:26:20,417 --> 01:26:22,041
I have a gift for you.

763
01:26:22,125 --> 01:26:23,166
Bring her out!

764
01:27:00,125 --> 01:27:01,874
I found Madam for you.

765
01:27:01,959 --> 01:27:05,458
I kept her alive for your reunion.

766
01:27:23,042 --> 01:27:24,291
Go!

767
01:27:31,334 --> 01:27:33,791
Turn around!

768
01:28:02,042 --> 01:28:04,458
I'm so sorry.

769
01:28:08,542 --> 01:28:10,874
I thought I had it all.

770
01:28:12,209 --> 01:28:15,083
I thought I could protect you.

771
01:28:16,375 --> 01:28:18,208
But I harmed you instead.

772
01:28:39,792 --> 01:28:41,666
Positions!

773
01:28:43,084 --> 01:28:44,666
Don't shoot...

774
01:28:47,834 --> 01:28:49,541
Ready!

775
01:28:52,959 --> 01:28:56,374
lt's on fire! lt's on fire!

776
01:28:57,709 --> 01:28:59,583
lt's on fire!

777
01:28:59,667 --> 01:29:01,708
Guards stay here!
The rest follow me!

778
01:29:01,792 --> 01:29:02,833
Yes, sir!

779
01:29:06,375 --> 01:29:07,499
Let's go!

780
01:29:17,375 --> 01:29:19,166
Help! Master!

781
01:29:19,250 --> 01:29:21,791
Let us out! Let us out!

782
01:29:21,875 --> 01:29:23,958
Help us!

783
01:29:25,959 --> 01:29:29,208
- What is going on?
- Someone is stealing the treasures!

784
01:29:45,542 --> 01:29:47,874
Out of my way!

785
01:29:59,167 --> 01:30:00,458
Tsao Man.

786
01:30:44,500 --> 01:30:45,541
Hou Chieh!

787
01:30:45,625 --> 01:30:49,541
Let her go!

788
01:30:49,625 --> 01:30:52,749
Are you crying?

789
01:30:54,084 --> 01:30:55,416
Let her go!

790
01:30:55,500 --> 01:30:57,583
Even your death...

791
01:30:58,625 --> 01:31:00,583
won't satisfy me!

792
01:31:01,625 --> 01:31:03,374
You witnessed your daughter die.

793
01:31:03,459 --> 01:31:06,624
Now I want you
to watch your wife drown.

794
01:31:07,500 --> 01:31:09,458
I'm loving this!

795
01:31:12,625 --> 01:31:14,124
Let her go.

796
01:31:16,250 --> 01:31:19,083
I'm a monk now.
She's no longer my wife.

797
01:31:26,834 --> 01:31:30,249
Too bad you're a monk.
She's gorgeous.

798
01:31:30,334 --> 01:31:32,208
What a waste.

799
01:31:42,917 --> 01:31:44,708
Stop it!

800
01:31:52,125 --> 01:31:54,916
Shaolin monks took the treasure

801
01:31:55,000 --> 01:31:58,624
and freed the workers!

802
01:32:10,292 --> 01:32:12,458
A bunch of crooked monks!

803
01:32:13,417 --> 01:32:14,458
Kill them both!

804
01:32:45,625 --> 01:32:47,166
Chingchueh, go!

805
01:33:36,917 --> 01:33:38,374
Senior Brother!

806
01:34:00,750 --> 01:34:09,291
Leave!

807
01:34:17,667 --> 01:34:18,666
Senior Brother!

808
01:34:18,750 --> 01:34:19,791
Go!

809
01:34:20,959 --> 01:34:21,999
Leave!

810
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:24,166
Senior Brother!

811
01:34:36,667 --> 01:34:40,208
- Senior Brother!
- You dare to disobey my order?

812
01:34:42,042 --> 01:34:43,333
Leave!

813
01:34:46,250 --> 01:34:47,791
Go!

814
01:34:47,875 --> 01:34:50,749
We'll take these men back!

815
01:36:36,334 --> 01:36:37,916
What are you doing?

816
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:39,041
Go back!

817
01:36:43,417 --> 01:36:45,249
Abbot.

818
01:36:45,334 --> 01:36:46,583
Go back...

819
01:36:53,209 --> 01:36:54,124
Hey!

820
01:36:54,209 --> 01:36:57,791
Boys, don't force me!
I'm warning you, go back now!

821
01:36:58,584 --> 01:37:00,416
I don't want to shoot children.

822
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:20,916
Please show compassion, sir.

823
01:37:21,000 --> 01:37:22,999
Let us help Abbot.

824
01:37:23,084 --> 01:37:25,333
A good deed will make you happy.

825
01:37:31,792 --> 01:37:36,541
The Abbot has taught us,
the one who repents is a hero.

826
01:37:36,625 --> 01:37:41,583
Let it be, go home.
Your family is waiting for you.

827
01:37:57,209 --> 01:37:58,208
Ridiculous!

828
01:37:58,292 --> 01:38:00,249
Arrest these rebels!

829
01:38:18,125 --> 01:38:19,166
Buddha be praised.

830
01:38:27,375 --> 01:38:29,416
No! I don't know kung fu.

831
01:38:29,500 --> 01:38:30,749
Buddha be praised.

832
01:38:47,500 --> 01:38:49,874
Stop fighting! Stop fighting!

833
01:39:05,917 --> 01:39:07,541
I'll teach you a lesson!

834
01:39:24,334 --> 01:39:25,666
Abbot!

835
01:39:25,750 --> 01:39:26,791
Are you all right?

836
01:39:35,667 --> 01:39:37,749
Stir-fry them like vegetables!

837
01:39:55,750 --> 01:39:58,249
Make noodles out of them!

838
01:40:24,292 --> 01:40:26,291
Well done!

839
01:40:26,375 --> 01:40:27,791
Abbot! Abbot!

840
01:40:27,875 --> 01:40:30,166
Are you all right?

841
01:40:31,667 --> 01:40:32,749
Check on the others.

842
01:40:32,834 --> 01:40:33,874
- Yes.
- Go!

843
01:40:55,250 --> 01:40:56,583
It's them!

844
01:41:01,834 --> 01:41:04,249
My son!

845
01:41:07,334 --> 01:41:09,833
Mother! Mother!

846
01:41:16,500 --> 01:41:18,916
Father!

847
01:41:36,459 --> 01:41:38,583
Chingneng didn't sacrifice himself

848
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:41,291
in vain.

849
01:41:41,375 --> 01:41:44,208
Try to let it go.

850
01:42:01,875 --> 01:42:03,749
Everyone,

851
01:42:03,834 --> 01:42:06,124
please pack up.

852
01:42:06,792 --> 01:42:09,374
We will be leaving the Temple soon.

853
01:42:26,375 --> 01:42:28,166
I know you're afraid.

854
01:42:29,792 --> 01:42:31,749
l am, too.

855
01:42:32,584 --> 01:42:35,624
No family, no home...

856
01:42:37,709 --> 01:42:38,999
Of course we're afraid.

857
01:42:45,000 --> 01:42:46,916
After spending time

858
01:42:47,959 --> 01:42:49,249
with you,

859
01:42:50,334 --> 01:42:53,041
I learnt that

860
01:42:53,125 --> 01:42:54,916
Shaolin is paradise.

861
01:42:56,542 --> 01:42:58,666
It's also my home.

862
01:43:00,167 --> 01:43:02,249
Shaolin Temple today,

863
01:43:03,209 --> 01:43:05,124
may face destruction.

864
01:43:06,792 --> 01:43:08,583
But the spirit of Shaolin,

865
01:43:09,792 --> 01:43:12,666
its every flower and leaf,

866
01:43:12,750 --> 01:43:14,874
its beams, pillars,

867
01:43:14,959 --> 01:43:17,916
every brick and tile,
will forever live on in us.

868
01:43:18,875 --> 01:43:20,958
Shaolin has taught me

869
01:43:22,417 --> 01:43:24,416
to be determined and brave.

870
01:43:25,250 --> 01:43:27,166
Don't ever give up.

871
01:43:27,250 --> 01:43:29,208
l beg you,

872
01:43:33,542 --> 01:43:35,999
to live your lives well.

873
01:44:21,959 --> 01:44:24,833
- Do me a favour.
- Yes?

874
01:44:27,709 --> 01:44:28,958
Lead them out of here.

875
01:44:29,042 --> 01:44:30,999
No, I can't.

876
01:44:31,084 --> 01:44:32,958
I've never left the Temple.

877
01:44:33,042 --> 01:44:34,749
I'm scared.

878
01:44:36,542 --> 01:44:37,999
Are you afraid?

879
01:44:38,084 --> 01:44:39,124
Look at them.

880
01:44:40,334 --> 01:44:41,874
They need you.

881
01:44:43,000 --> 01:44:45,458
They're even more afraid.

882
01:44:48,584 --> 01:44:50,249
Can I really do it?

883
01:44:57,542 --> 01:44:58,583
OK!

884
01:44:59,709 --> 01:45:00,749
I'll do it!

885
01:45:37,000 --> 01:45:41,208
Time is of the essence!
Ensure a safe passage for the refugees.

886
01:45:41,292 --> 01:45:43,624
Chingkong,
leave with the Abbot.

887
01:45:43,709 --> 01:45:47,499
- Chinghai, I'll join you later.
- I'll teach them a lesson!

888
01:47:10,417 --> 01:47:11,666
Go!

889
01:47:35,917 --> 01:47:39,083
You bastards want
to destroy my temple?

890
01:47:39,167 --> 01:47:40,708
I'll lead you to the netherworld.

891
01:48:48,250 --> 01:48:50,249
Tsao Man.

892
01:48:50,334 --> 01:48:52,083
What do you want?

893
01:48:53,375 --> 01:48:57,708
You possess far more than you need.

894
01:48:59,250 --> 01:49:00,458
Let it go.

895
01:49:01,459 --> 01:49:02,999
Don't kill any more.

896
01:49:05,959 --> 01:49:09,749
We must be ruthless in times of war.

897
01:49:10,542 --> 01:49:12,166
Don't be like me,

898
01:49:14,042 --> 01:49:16,749
filled with remorse after erring.

899
01:49:20,750 --> 01:49:21,999
Stop now.

900
01:49:22,000 --> 01:49:23,791
Can we not stop fighting?

901
01:49:24,709 --> 01:49:26,166
What do you think?

902
01:50:38,292 --> 01:50:39,541
I lose.

903
01:51:05,084 --> 01:51:08,708
They took my treasure.

904
01:51:10,500 --> 01:51:12,499
We need to cut our losses.

905
01:51:14,042 --> 01:51:17,208
We cannot allow news of
what has happened to leak out!

906
01:51:18,125 --> 01:51:20,499
Kill everyone in there!

907
01:51:20,584 --> 01:51:21,708
Fire!

908
01:52:06,084 --> 01:52:08,333
Shaolin Temple...

909
01:52:34,667 --> 01:52:37,541
Don't mess with Shaolin Temple!

910
01:52:50,750 --> 01:52:54,749
Buddha be praised.

911
01:53:14,834 --> 01:53:17,791
You can't go back!
It's dangerous!

912
01:53:17,875 --> 01:53:19,874
Abbot, my daughter is missing...

913
01:53:19,959 --> 01:53:21,874
My daughter is missing!

914
01:53:23,125 --> 01:53:24,499
Mummy...

915
01:53:26,209 --> 01:53:27,166
lt's too dangerous.

916
01:53:39,042 --> 01:53:39,833
Senior Brother!

917
01:53:39,917 --> 01:53:41,999
- Senior Brother...
- Senior Brother!

918
01:53:43,459 --> 01:53:44,624
Quick!

919
01:53:47,084 --> 01:53:48,124
Senior Brother!

920
01:53:56,667 --> 01:53:57,666
Brother!

921
01:53:57,750 --> 01:54:01,166
- Chinghai!
- Senior Brother!

922
01:54:01,625 --> 01:54:17,041
- Senior Brother!
- Senior Brother!

923
01:54:17,834 --> 01:54:20,208
I'll stay behind!
Take them away!

924
01:54:20,292 --> 01:54:21,208
Yes Abbot!

925
01:55:47,125 --> 01:55:49,208
That's enough.

926
01:56:20,750 --> 01:56:22,583
Grab hold of me!

927
01:56:57,375 --> 01:56:59,458
Buddha be praised.

928
01:57:06,292 --> 01:57:08,458
Evil is born from the heart.

929
01:57:09,792 --> 01:57:11,874
Repent.

930
01:58:18,834 --> 01:58:20,041
Why...

931
02:00:27,292 --> 02:00:33,333
A boundless mind is rewarded
with unending fortunes

932
02:00:33,417 --> 02:00:39,666
Unending is life,
linked by love

933
02:00:39,750 --> 02:00:43,874
Why do you look but not see

934
02:00:43,959 --> 02:00:46,249
The teachings of the rules

935
02:00:46,334 --> 02:00:52,583
Let's us understand
spirit, senses, space willingly

936
02:02:49,792 --> 02:02:51,833
Master Uncle,

937
02:02:51,917 --> 02:02:54,291
the temple is no more.

938
02:02:56,334 --> 02:02:57,916
No,

939
02:02:58,000 --> 02:03:00,166
Shaolin Temple is always in us.

940
02:03:00,250 --> 02:03:03,124
It can never be destroyed.

941
02:03:30,375 --> 02:03:32,458
Life is about affinity.

942
02:03:33,834 --> 02:03:36,499
Follow affinity

943
02:03:36,584 --> 02:03:39,083
and live freely.

944
02:03:40,167 --> 02:03:41,958
Come.

945
02:03:42,042 --> 02:03:44,499
Let her keep you company.

946
02:04:00,084 --> 02:04:01,458
You're not leaving?

947
02:04:05,750 --> 02:04:07,833
Tsao Man is here.

948
02:04:09,584 --> 02:04:11,666
His mistakes were mine.

949
02:04:12,709 --> 02:04:14,249
Only I can help him.

950
02:04:19,084 --> 02:04:21,166
You've really changed.

951
02:04:25,542 --> 02:04:27,624
I know...

952
02:04:31,042 --> 02:04:33,666
We can never be together again.

953
02:04:36,750 --> 02:04:38,833
But...

954
02:04:41,792 --> 02:04:44,499
I really like you as you are.
