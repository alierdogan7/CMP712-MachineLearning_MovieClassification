1
00:00:46,875 --> 00:00:48,706
In America...

2
00:00:49,275 --> 00:00:52,233
... there's a burglary
every 11 seconds...

3
00:00:53,555 --> 00:00:58,310
...an armed robbery
every 65 seconds...

4
00:00:59,515 --> 00:01:03,224
...a violent crime
every 25 seconds...

5
00:01:04,555 --> 00:01:08,070
...a murder every 24 minutes...

6
00:01:09,195 --> 00:01:12,392
...and 250 rapes a day.

7
00:03:28,035 --> 00:03:30,230
Jerry, don't push it together like that.

8
00:03:30,475 --> 00:03:31,954
Will you just let me do it?

9
00:03:32,835 --> 00:03:34,348
You make me sick!

10
00:04:02,075 --> 00:04:03,349
Watch it!

11
00:04:21,195 --> 00:04:22,071
Hey, pal!

12
00:04:22,315 --> 00:04:23,509
Can I help you?

13
00:05:31,435 --> 00:05:35,792
We are willing to talk.
No one wants to hurt you.

14
00:05:36,035 --> 00:05:37,673
Do you understand?

15
00:05:38,075 --> 00:05:42,512
We are willing to talk.
There's no more need for violence.

16
00:05:43,275 --> 00:05:47,712
There's no way out except by talking.
Do you understand?

17
00:05:47,915 --> 00:05:50,190
No one wants to hurt you.

18
00:05:51,195 --> 00:05:52,787
We want to help.

19
00:05:53,795 --> 00:05:56,104
Please, communicate with us.

20
00:05:57,475 --> 00:05:58,271
You can go.

21
00:06:01,195 --> 00:06:02,310
You can go!

22
00:06:04,395 --> 00:06:05,623
You're free!

23
00:06:08,395 --> 00:06:11,751
No one wants to hurt you.
Do you understand?

24
00:06:15,075 --> 00:06:18,431
-Enough of trying to deal with this maniac!
-Get down!

25
00:06:19,155 --> 00:06:22,465
All we need is more time.
We can get control of the situation.

26
00:06:22,715 --> 00:06:24,228
What control?

27
00:06:34,915 --> 00:06:36,428
Call the Cobra.

28
00:07:28,995 --> 00:07:30,474
-How bad is it?
-It's bad.

29
00:07:30,715 --> 00:07:31,784
Any I.D. on the guy?

30
00:07:32,035 --> 00:07:35,584
Just another asshole who woke up
hating the world. What's happening?

31
00:07:35,875 --> 00:07:39,345
I don't agree with them bringing you
in here. I just want you to know that.

32
00:07:42,355 --> 00:07:43,549
Come on.

33
00:07:44,395 --> 00:07:45,350
Come on!

34
00:07:47,235 --> 00:07:48,190
Move!

35
00:08:33,875 --> 00:08:36,025
Get down, you.
Get down there, man.

36
00:08:36,275 --> 00:08:37,993
Shut up!
You get away from her!

37
00:08:38,955 --> 00:08:39,944
Shut up!

38
00:08:56,075 --> 00:08:58,384
I'll kill you, man.
I'll kill them all!

39
00:08:59,555 --> 00:09:01,466
It's the way of the New World.

40
00:09:01,715 --> 00:09:04,229
So where are those TV cameras?

41
00:09:04,475 --> 00:09:07,069
Hey man, I've got a bomb here.

42
00:09:08,115 --> 00:09:09,946
I'll kill them all!

43
00:09:10,915 --> 00:09:13,668
You bring in the TV,
or I'll kill them all.

44
00:09:13,915 --> 00:09:15,507
You understand?

45
00:09:15,755 --> 00:09:17,950
It's the way of the New World!

46
00:09:31,235 --> 00:09:33,988
What are you waiting for?
Let's go!

47
00:09:35,435 --> 00:09:38,347
Come on over here, I'll kill them.
You got that?

48
00:09:39,275 --> 00:09:41,789
You're all trash, anyway.
You all deserve it.

49
00:09:54,755 --> 00:09:55,710
Dirtbag!

50
00:09:57,195 --> 00:09:58,947
You're a lousy shot.

51
00:09:59,915 --> 00:10:01,951
I don't like lousy shots.

52
00:10:02,195 --> 00:10:04,868
You wasted a kid for nothing.

53
00:10:06,155 --> 00:10:08,544
Now I think it's time to waste you.

54
00:10:16,315 --> 00:10:17,464
Hold it!

55
00:10:17,795 --> 00:10:19,547
Come on, man.

56
00:10:19,795 --> 00:10:21,114
I got a bomb here.

57
00:10:21,355 --> 00:10:22,674
I'll kill her.

58
00:10:23,235 --> 00:10:24,714
I'll blow this place up.

59
00:10:25,155 --> 00:10:26,224
Go ahead.

60
00:10:26,475 --> 00:10:28,272
I don't shop here.

61
00:10:33,555 --> 00:10:35,386
Just relax, amigo.

62
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:36,829
You want to talk?

63
00:10:37,075 --> 00:10:40,192
We'll talk.
I'm a sucker for good conversation.

64
00:10:40,435 --> 00:10:41,470
I don't want to talk to you.

65
00:10:41,715 --> 00:10:45,390
You bring the television cameras
in here now. Come on, bring it in!

66
00:10:46,595 --> 00:10:47,914
I can't do that.

67
00:10:48,195 --> 00:10:49,184
Why?

68
00:10:50,475 --> 00:10:53,626
I don't deal with psychos.
I put them away.

69
00:10:53,875 --> 00:10:55,194
I ain't no psycho, man.

70
00:10:56,075 --> 00:10:56,985
I'm a hero!

71
00:10:57,635 --> 00:10:59,705
You're looking at a fucking hunter.

72
00:11:00,075 --> 00:11:01,747
I'm a hero of the New World.

73
00:11:03,355 --> 00:11:05,949
You're a disease, and I'm the cure.

74
00:11:07,555 --> 00:11:08,351
Die!

75
00:11:11,235 --> 00:11:12,224
Drop it!

76
00:11:41,155 --> 00:11:42,349
Come on.

77
00:11:51,275 --> 00:11:52,549
You okay, man?

78
00:11:55,075 --> 00:11:56,872
You're the one
who killed the maniac?

79
00:11:57,435 --> 00:12:00,074
Did he say why he did it?
ls it related to the Night Slasher?

80
00:12:00,275 --> 00:12:02,869
The Night Slasher's a different case.
People, please!

81
00:12:03,115 --> 00:12:04,389
Let's have a little room!

82
00:12:07,315 --> 00:12:10,944
Was it necessary for it to end
like this? Did he have to die?

83
00:12:11,195 --> 00:12:13,584
Come on, don't listen to this asshole.

84
00:12:13,955 --> 00:12:16,071
Did you use unnecessary deadly force?

85
00:12:16,315 --> 00:12:17,907
I used everything I had.

86
00:12:18,155 --> 00:12:20,953
Is this a public forum?
We have work to do out here!

87
00:12:21,195 --> 00:12:25,108
We want to know what makes a policeman
a judge and jury. People have rights.

88
00:12:25,355 --> 00:12:28,108
You think a maniac who blew a kid's
heart out should have rights?

89
00:12:28,355 --> 00:12:32,667
No matter what you think, people
are entitled to protection by the law.

90
00:12:36,195 --> 00:12:38,106
You tell that to his family!

91
00:12:43,235 --> 00:12:45,590
All right, the show's over.
Come on, clear this area!

92
00:13:01,275 --> 00:13:03,072
-Move it!
-Fuck you!

93
00:13:10,995 --> 00:13:12,747
What's your problem?

94
00:13:23,435 --> 00:13:26,632
What's your problema, ése ?
You touched my car, man.

95
00:13:31,155 --> 00:13:32,827
That's bad for your health.

96
00:13:33,075 --> 00:13:35,031
What is, pinche?

97
00:13:37,035 --> 00:13:38,150
Me.

98
00:13:42,155 --> 00:13:43,144
Clean up your act.

99
00:13:49,315 --> 00:13:51,385
Yeah! You're in trouble, man.

100
00:13:52,355 --> 00:13:53,947
You told him, ése.

101
00:15:27,195 --> 00:15:29,948
Tonight, the man known as
the Night Slasher...

102
00:15:30,195 --> 00:15:33,790
...has struck for the 16th time
in just over a month 's time.

103
00:15:34,035 --> 00:15:37,266
The 22-year-old victim was
mutilated with a sharp instrument...

104
00:15:37,515 --> 00:15:41,144
...and seemed to be just as unlikely
a victim as the other 15.

105
00:15:41,395 --> 00:15:45,673
Not much else is known other than that
the Night Slasher preys upon anyone.

106
00:15:45,915 --> 00:15:48,748
Victims have included businessmen,
Asian immigrants...

107
00:15:48,995 --> 00:15:52,749
... the elderly and, in one case,
a sexually assaulted child.

108
00:15:52,995 --> 00:15:55,793
The serial killer has thrown
the city into a panic...

109
00:15:56,035 --> 00:16:00,108
...and up until now, no one
has had a clue to his identity.

110
00:16:00,355 --> 00:16:03,631
The killer has been known
to crawl through windows...

111
00:16:03,875 --> 00:16:05,911
...and kill the victims in their sleep.

112
00:16:06,115 --> 00:16:08,834
The method of death has been
silent instruments...

113
00:16:09,075 --> 00:16:11,509
...such as claw hammers,
knives and axes.

114
00:17:22,155 --> 00:17:25,511
-There's no question?
-90% sure it's the identical weapon.

115
00:17:25,795 --> 00:17:28,628
Cuts are straight, long, deep,
just like the others.

116
00:17:28,875 --> 00:17:31,867
That brings the count to 16, and still
this bastard shows no distinct pattern.

117
00:17:32,115 --> 00:17:33,707
Maybe there's more than one.
                          
118
00:17:33,955 --> 00:17:36,185
Look, this is not your specialty, okay?

119
00:17:36,595 --> 00:17:38,313
This is pure investigative work...

120
00:17:38,515 --> 00:17:39,789
...not jumping out a window.

121
00:17:40,235 --> 00:17:43,864
-We need to beef up the task force.
-We need interagency cooperation.

122
00:17:44,035 --> 00:17:46,788
Every department wants to be
the hero in this case!

123
00:17:47,035 --> 00:17:50,152
I don't want to be a hero.
I just want to get involved.

124
00:17:54,875 --> 00:17:56,194
If I may, captain...?

125
00:17:56,435 --> 00:17:59,427
If we let Cobretti use his tactics,
we're asking for trouble.

126
00:17:59,635 --> 00:18:00,954
What are you saying?

127
00:18:01,155 --> 00:18:04,864
-He should stay on the zombie squad.
-You're telling me where to stay?

128
00:18:05,075 --> 00:18:07,908
It's nothing personal.
We're just different kinds of cops.

129
00:18:08,155 --> 00:18:11,784
Like Monte says, you're a specialist
who does a job nobody wants.

130
00:18:12,035 --> 00:18:15,107
But we can't shake people down.
Internal Affairs will jump on us.

131
00:18:15,315 --> 00:18:16,987
-Then we lost.
-Lost?

132
00:18:17,235 --> 00:18:21,467
As long as we play by these bullshit
rules and the killer doesn't, we lose.

133
00:18:33,115 --> 00:18:36,232
-What do you want to do?
-Nothing we can do, except wait.

134
00:18:36,435 --> 00:18:37,550
For what?

135
00:18:38,235 --> 00:18:40,305
For it to happen again.

136
00:19:15,195 --> 00:19:18,392
I'm, like, really sorry.
Do you think there's, like, any damage?

137
00:19:18,635 --> 00:19:21,911
How could you have hit me?
Have you been drinking or something?

138
00:19:22,595 --> 00:19:23,869
Yes.

139
00:20:04,315 --> 00:20:05,350
Get the license plate!

140
00:20:11,355 --> 00:20:12,344
Come on!

141
00:20:30,275 --> 00:20:31,993
He's daring us to catch him.

142
00:20:32,235 --> 00:20:34,908
-We dig in and find that lead.
-Forget it.

143
00:20:35,155 --> 00:20:37,146
Forget it?
What options do we have?

144
00:20:37,395 --> 00:20:38,748
Call the bastard.

145
00:20:42,755 --> 00:20:44,950
Metro Police. Can I help you?

146
00:21:12,475 --> 00:21:13,351
Gentlemen.

147
00:21:13,795 --> 00:21:15,194
Captain.

148
00:21:15,875 --> 00:21:17,274
I won't waste any time.

149
00:21:17,675 --> 00:21:20,985
You know almost every sicko
in this city. Shake them down.

150
00:21:21,275 --> 00:21:23,106
Do what you have to do
to get a lead.

151
00:21:23,355 --> 00:21:24,629
If I find him?

152
00:21:24,875 --> 00:21:26,149
Do what you do best.

153
00:21:27,395 --> 00:21:29,431
And try not to waste the wrong guy.

154
00:21:30,155 --> 00:21:31,349
But then again...

155
00:21:31,795 --> 00:21:34,150
...what do you care, right?

156
00:21:37,275 --> 00:21:38,993
You know, when this is over...

157
00:21:39,275 --> 00:21:43,985
...I'd like to celebrate by
punching a hole in Monte's chest.

158
00:21:46,435 --> 00:21:48,187
You know what the trouble
with you is?

159
00:21:50,435 --> 00:21:51,868
You're too violent.

160
00:21:54,035 --> 00:21:55,388
It's all that sugar you eat.

161
00:21:56,075 --> 00:21:58,748
-This is the first sugar today.
-It's that junk food.

162
00:21:58,995 --> 00:21:59,905
Bullshit!

163
00:22:00,155 --> 00:22:02,715
Try prunes, something natural.
Raisins.

164
00:22:03,395 --> 00:22:06,353
Try fish.
Fish and rice. Very good.

165
00:22:07,235 --> 00:22:08,350
Fish and rice!

166
00:25:20,355 --> 00:25:22,027
-I'll take it from here.
-Sure?

167
00:25:22,275 --> 00:25:24,630
No problem.
Her car's right over there.

168
00:25:24,875 --> 00:25:26,194
You're in good hands.
Good night.

169
00:25:26,435 --> 00:25:30,667
Listen, I still think if you wanted to,
you could be doing a lot bigger layouts.

170
00:25:30,915 --> 00:25:33,224
I mean it's up to you,
but I could help.

171
00:25:33,475 --> 00:25:35,511
I don't want to have
to play these games.

172
00:25:35,755 --> 00:25:38,747
-Games? What games?
-You know what games!

173
00:25:39,395 --> 00:25:41,511
I'd be sick not to want
to sleep with you.

174
00:25:42,355 --> 00:25:44,823
Then don't do it for me.
Do it for your career.

175
00:25:47,155 --> 00:25:48,349
Did you hear something?

176
00:25:50,315 --> 00:25:53,068
It's not like I'm
asking you to marry me.

177
00:26:03,475 --> 00:26:06,308
I see it will take time
to make you change your mind.

178
00:26:06,555 --> 00:26:10,434
-So where do you want to eat?
-Please, Dan, I'm not hungry!

179
00:26:10,955 --> 00:26:12,832
I'm not doing this for me, really.

180
00:26:13,075 --> 00:26:16,784
Look, I'm just trying
to help you find happiness.

181
00:26:17,875 --> 00:26:19,672
I forgot my bag.

182
00:26:20,235 --> 00:26:22,191
You see?
You do need me.

183
00:26:43,915 --> 00:26:46,588
Please! Come on!
My God!

184
00:26:52,035 --> 00:26:53,388
Leave me alone!

185
00:26:54,275 --> 00:26:55,310
They're trying to kill me!

186
00:26:55,555 --> 00:26:56,829
Get back!

187
00:27:01,595 --> 00:27:03,074
Kill her.

188
00:28:13,155 --> 00:28:17,194
Doctor Dorson,
please call nurses' station 4 West.

189
00:28:17,555 --> 00:28:19,113
How long before that kicks in?

190
00:28:19,355 --> 00:28:20,504
I don't want to sleep.

191
00:28:20,995 --> 00:28:23,907
It won't make you sleep.
It will just calm you down.

192
00:28:24,515 --> 00:28:26,551
Now, I'll be back when you're finished.

193
00:28:29,475 --> 00:28:30,669
Hi.

194
00:28:30,915 --> 00:28:33,987
Is it "Ka-nudsen"? Ka?

195
00:28:35,155 --> 00:28:36,190
That's what I thought.

196
00:28:38,915 --> 00:28:40,348
I am Sergeant Gonzales. . .

197
00:28:40,675 --> 00:28:44,554
...and that intense-looking gentleman
behind you is Lieutenant Cobretti.

198
00:28:45,315 --> 00:28:47,192
We're a pair of really nice guys...

199
00:28:47,475 --> 00:28:49,784
...who are here to ask you
a lot of bad questions.

200
00:28:50,475 --> 00:28:51,464
Is that all right?

201
00:28:55,235 --> 00:28:56,953
You don't look like policemen.

202
00:28:57,715 --> 00:28:58,784
No?

203
00:28:59,035 --> 00:29:01,503
You're kidding?
She must mean you.

204
00:29:02,155 --> 00:29:04,988
No, we are.
We're the real thing.

205
00:29:06,595 --> 00:29:09,189
I don't understand
how this happened to me.

206
00:29:10,355 --> 00:29:13,472
Why don't you take a minute?
Think about it.

207
00:29:15,675 --> 00:29:17,825
-Did you have a fight with anyone?
-No.

208
00:29:18,075 --> 00:29:19,713
You owe money to anybody?

209
00:29:20,675 --> 00:29:22,950
You been around drugs,
people who deal drugs?

210
00:29:23,675 --> 00:29:25,347
Never. No.

211
00:29:27,315 --> 00:29:28,668
That's nice.

212
00:29:31,195 --> 00:29:34,392
So in the last few weeks,
there hasn't been anything?

213
00:29:34,635 --> 00:29:36,387
No threats of any kind?

214
00:29:36,635 --> 00:29:37,784
No.

215
00:29:38,475 --> 00:29:41,308
There was this guy who
scared me a little tonight.

216
00:29:42,635 --> 00:29:43,590
Who?

217
00:29:45,195 --> 00:29:47,311
I don't know who he was.

218
00:29:47,875 --> 00:29:49,831
Some guy broke down by the underpass.

219
00:29:50,075 --> 00:29:51,588
I just drove away.

220
00:29:53,995 --> 00:29:55,428
What time were you there?

221
00:29:57,195 --> 00:29:58,548
Maybe 10:00.

222
00:29:59,315 --> 00:30:01,590
He scared you. Why?
What was he doing?

223
00:30:02,595 --> 00:30:04,870
It was just the way he looked at me.

224
00:30:05,395 --> 00:30:07,955
What else did you see?
Did you see anything else?

225
00:30:08,355 --> 00:30:11,711
Yeah, there was another car
in front of them.

226
00:30:13,635 --> 00:30:14,590
Them?

227
00:30:16,235 --> 00:30:17,953
I think there was three of them.

228
00:30:18,435 --> 00:30:21,188
You think you would recognize him
if you saw him again?

229
00:30:21,675 --> 00:30:22,903
The tall one?

230
00:30:23,195 --> 00:30:25,993
Yeah, the one that wants to kill you.

231
00:30:49,875 --> 00:30:51,672
She knows your face.

232
00:30:52,395 --> 00:30:53,987
I know where she is.

233
00:31:00,075 --> 00:31:01,793
Let me get her for you.

234
00:31:08,235 --> 00:31:09,634
She's mine.

235
00:31:13,715 --> 00:31:15,433
You done, Fred?

236
00:31:16,515 --> 00:31:17,584
Cute guy.

237
00:31:19,515 --> 00:31:20,630
So, what do you think?

238
00:31:21,755 --> 00:31:23,347
It looks a little like him.

239
00:31:23,595 --> 00:31:25,586
You can't describe the other two?

240
00:31:26,275 --> 00:31:28,106
No, it was too dark.

241
00:31:28,355 --> 00:31:31,745
-Want to run prints at headquarters?
-I'll take care of it. Thanks.

242
00:31:31,995 --> 00:31:35,510
Tonight, you'll stay here. Tomorrow,
we'll move you to a safe house.

243
00:31:35,915 --> 00:31:38,110
Why do I have to stay around this?
I want to go.

244
00:31:38,395 --> 00:31:40,989
You're the one who can place him
at the crime scene.

245
00:31:41,235 --> 00:31:43,271
Until we get him,
it's got to be that way.

246
00:31:47,155 --> 00:31:48,349
Tony, you hungry?

247
00:31:48,635 --> 00:31:49,590
What do you got?

248
00:31:50,275 --> 00:31:52,152
Something that looks like cheese.

249
00:31:52,435 --> 00:31:54,346
No, there's some cake over there.

250
00:31:54,595 --> 00:31:56,950
-Take the cheese.
-I don't want the cheese.

251
00:31:57,195 --> 00:31:59,914
-I saw some cake.
-You're done with this, aren't you?

252
00:32:00,235 --> 00:32:01,463
Yes.

253
00:32:02,395 --> 00:32:04,863
All right, take the cake.
But save it, okay?

254
00:32:20,035 --> 00:32:22,469
She's going to wreck our New World.

255
00:32:22,715 --> 00:32:24,307
And the dream.

256
00:32:25,035 --> 00:32:27,071
You have to stop her.

257
00:32:33,315 --> 00:32:35,226
Great-looking guy, huh?

258
00:32:35,475 --> 00:32:37,193
Do you have that upside-down?

259
00:32:37,515 --> 00:32:39,665
No, he's just a regular dirtbag.

260
00:32:39,915 --> 00:32:43,066
I want to go to my place
and check this out against my files.

261
00:32:43,315 --> 00:32:45,271
I'll be back in a couple of hours, okay?

262
00:32:45,515 --> 00:32:48,188
There's a real nice-looking lady, huh?
Wasn't she?

263
00:32:48,435 --> 00:32:51,154
-The one upstairs?
-The one upstairs. You remember?

264
00:32:51,395 --> 00:32:53,784
I didn't notice, Gonzales.
I was on the job.

265
00:32:54,035 --> 00:32:56,549
-I was paying attention to business.
-Me too.

266
00:32:56,795 --> 00:32:57,989
Good night, all right?

267
00:32:58,235 --> 00:32:59,224
Fucking liar!

268
00:32:59,475 --> 00:33:01,784
-Watch your mouth. You're in public.
-Of course.

269
00:33:29,315 --> 00:33:30,430
You're a good citizen.

270
00:34:42,315 --> 00:34:44,465
You can't buy a damn thing
that's worth a--

271
00:35:03,235 --> 00:35:05,829
You men are supposed to use
the service elevator.

272
00:35:06,075 --> 00:35:08,509
Next time, use the stairs.

273
00:35:33,075 --> 00:35:36,988
Remember the health code.
Next time take the stairs.

274
00:35:58,435 --> 00:36:00,346
A little late to be mopping up.

275
00:36:02,875 --> 00:36:04,593
You want me to say something?

276
00:36:05,075 --> 00:36:07,873
No, I've got to do my rounds.
I'll tell him.

277
00:36:08,115 --> 00:36:09,594
See you next break.

278
00:36:31,875 --> 00:36:34,628
Hey, I'm in your office.
What do you need me for?

279
00:36:34,915 --> 00:36:35,825
Why are you there?

280
00:36:36,115 --> 00:36:38,071
Headquarters said
you wanted me here.

281
00:36:38,315 --> 00:36:40,385
Get back to the hospital!

282
00:36:40,755 --> 00:36:41,870
Presley!

283
00:39:07,635 --> 00:39:08,511
Pretty hair!

284
00:40:02,595 --> 00:40:04,904
Why are you doing this to me?

285
00:40:07,435 --> 00:40:09,744
Stop this right now!
Stop doing this to me!

286
00:40:23,795 --> 00:40:26,229
Is anybody here?

287
00:40:36,995 --> 00:40:39,384
Please remain calm.

288
00:40:39,675 --> 00:40:42,235
All exits from the hospital
are clearly marked.

289
00:40:43,395 --> 00:40:47,866
Please use the stairs and
proceed in an orderly manner.

290
00:40:48,115 --> 00:40:49,025
Do not run.

291
00:41:11,275 --> 00:41:13,106
You almost got everyone killed.

292
00:41:13,355 --> 00:41:16,711
-Now maybe you'll do it right.
-They've got somebody inside.

293
00:41:16,995 --> 00:41:19,907
Smart accusation, Cobretti.
Can you prove it?

294
00:41:21,155 --> 00:41:23,146
Chief Halliwell wants an answer.

295
00:41:24,075 --> 00:41:25,030
Not yet.

296
00:41:25,275 --> 00:41:26,947
I know what we're dealing with.

297
00:41:27,195 --> 00:41:29,072
Don't make things
harder than they are.

298
00:41:29,355 --> 00:41:31,425
Monte says you've got
a sketch of the suspect.

299
00:41:31,675 --> 00:41:32,949
Is this a game?

300
00:41:33,995 --> 00:41:35,826
He didn't say the magic word.

301
00:41:36,075 --> 00:41:37,144
What magic word?

302
00:41:37,915 --> 00:41:38,950
Please.

303
00:41:41,995 --> 00:41:44,634
All right, enough of this bullshit.
Do you understand?

304
00:41:45,715 --> 00:41:46,989
You bet.

305
00:41:48,675 --> 00:41:49,630
That's it?

306
00:41:51,075 --> 00:41:52,190
That's it.

307
00:41:56,755 --> 00:42:00,031
Cobretti, do you know
you have an attitude problem?

308
00:42:02,435 --> 00:42:04,903
Yeah, but it's just a little one.

309
00:42:15,115 --> 00:42:17,948
-He's going to get me, isn't he?
-No, he won't.

310
00:42:18,155 --> 00:42:21,465
How can you say that?
You said I'll be safe here.

311
00:42:23,315 --> 00:42:24,794
Who is he?

312
00:42:25,475 --> 00:42:27,067
We don't know yet.

313
00:42:28,795 --> 00:42:30,626
Come on, it's moving time.

314
00:42:30,955 --> 00:42:33,549
This is Officer Stalk.
She's assigned to this case.

315
00:42:33,795 --> 00:42:35,353
-So let's go, guys.
-Where?

316
00:42:35,595 --> 00:42:37,153
We're going to a safe house.

317
00:42:37,395 --> 00:42:38,589
Want help with this?

318
00:42:39,675 --> 00:42:41,472
-Want a bite?
-No.

319
00:42:41,755 --> 00:42:43,393
Don't you like health food?

320
00:42:45,955 --> 00:42:48,185
Did you notice
anything out of the ordinary?

321
00:42:48,795 --> 00:42:50,592
Did anybody challenge you?

322
00:42:52,235 --> 00:42:55,705
If you remember anything, let us know.
I appreciate your help.

323
00:42:55,955 --> 00:42:57,911
You've got to tell me
what happened here.

324
00:42:58,155 --> 00:43:01,465
I told you to let my team
handle this, understand?

325
00:43:01,755 --> 00:43:03,950
Of course you don't.
Listen, hotshot.

326
00:43:04,235 --> 00:43:06,544
-We want him just as much as you do.
-Do you?

327
00:43:06,795 --> 00:43:11,346
There were 3 men assigned to that room.
Headquarters called to take 2 off. Why?

328
00:43:11,595 --> 00:43:15,713
-Headquarters didn't do anything.
-No? Then who did?

329
00:43:15,915 --> 00:43:18,383
It's your show.
You find out.

330
00:44:33,155 --> 00:44:34,270
Where's Gonzales?

331
00:44:39,275 --> 00:44:40,151
Buckle up!

332
00:45:59,995 --> 00:46:01,986
He's crazy! He's crazy!

333
00:46:55,195 --> 00:46:55,991
Go!

334
00:47:06,235 --> 00:47:07,031
Watch out!

335
00:48:12,155 --> 00:48:13,747
Get down!

336
00:49:02,035 --> 00:49:04,344
It's so out of control.
Where do I start?

337
00:49:04,595 --> 00:49:05,823
With the legal problems.

338
00:49:06,075 --> 00:49:09,670
Of course we have legal problems.
The city's become one big battlefield.

339
00:49:09,955 --> 00:49:12,913
The public will be screaming
for federal assistance.

340
00:49:13,195 --> 00:49:14,708
I don't want FBI in here!

341
00:49:14,955 --> 00:49:18,550
We've got enough manpower to handle it,
so why can't we control this?

342
00:49:18,835 --> 00:49:22,714
Because we're against an army of
killers. I keep telling you guys that.

343
00:49:22,955 --> 00:49:24,946
-How do you know?
-I know, all right?

344
00:49:25,195 --> 00:49:28,426
-This army theory sounds weak.
-Does it really?

345
00:49:28,675 --> 00:49:32,224
What have you got, besides one scared
woman, to back up anything you say?

346
00:49:32,475 --> 00:49:36,468
And your idea of taking her out of
the city for protection is ridiculous.

347
00:49:36,955 --> 00:49:38,388
The security is here.

348
00:49:38,635 --> 00:49:41,707
Maybe she'll be safer here,
where we can keep an eye on her.

349
00:49:41,955 --> 00:49:43,388
-It won't work.
-Why not?

350
00:49:43,635 --> 00:49:46,513
We're dealing with fanatics
who'll do anything to waste her!

351
00:49:46,755 --> 00:49:49,144
Excuse me, but I've got
to say what I think.

352
00:49:49,435 --> 00:49:52,427
And I think this whole
sorry ordeal is like some...

353
00:49:52,675 --> 00:49:54,427
...damn sick joke, if you ask me.

354
00:49:54,915 --> 00:49:56,268
Nobody asked you, Monte.

355
00:49:56,515 --> 00:49:58,233
That's just too bad, isn't it?

356
00:49:58,435 --> 00:50:02,064
He doesn't give a rat's ass for
this girl. She's just live bait...

357
00:50:02,275 --> 00:50:04,425
...so King Cobretti here
can cut a new notch.

358
00:50:04,675 --> 00:50:06,905
You've already caused
a lot of people to die.

359
00:50:07,155 --> 00:50:08,873
How about letting her live?

360
00:50:11,475 --> 00:50:12,305
Enough!

361
00:50:21,075 --> 00:50:22,303
Next time.

362
00:50:22,995 --> 00:50:24,394
He's the psycho!

363
00:50:24,635 --> 00:50:25,954
What do we want to do?

364
00:50:26,395 --> 00:50:29,273
If he thinks those psychos
will follow her, let him go.

365
00:50:29,515 --> 00:50:31,904
At least we got them out of the city.

366
00:50:32,235 --> 00:50:33,634
-You all right?
-Yeah.

367
00:51:05,795 --> 00:51:06,944
Are your men out there?

368
00:51:07,395 --> 00:51:08,623
Yeah, they're out there.

369
00:51:09,675 --> 00:51:12,985
Are we just supposed to drive around
until he tries to kill us again?

370
00:51:13,715 --> 00:51:15,387
No, they won't get you.

371
00:51:15,635 --> 00:51:18,468
You keep saying that.
How do you know that for sure?

372
00:51:20,075 --> 00:51:21,906
You got to have faith.

373
00:51:51,555 --> 00:51:52,874
Can I ask you something?

374
00:51:53,435 --> 00:51:54,504
Sure, what's that?

375
00:51:54,755 --> 00:51:56,985
Why were you fighting
with the other police?

376
00:51:57,315 --> 00:52:00,671
Sometimes they don't buy what I believe.

377
00:52:01,995 --> 00:52:04,304
There's all these
crazy people everywhere.

378
00:52:04,555 --> 00:52:07,786
Why can't the police just
put them away and keep them away?

379
00:52:08,395 --> 00:52:10,192
Hey, tell it to the judge.

380
00:52:10,435 --> 00:52:11,231
What do you mean?

381
00:52:12,155 --> 00:52:14,271
We put them away.
They let them out.

382
00:52:15,395 --> 00:52:17,113
It makes me sick!

383
00:52:18,475 --> 00:52:21,273
Like I said, you got to
tell it to the judge.

384
00:52:33,435 --> 00:52:35,391
Great day for junk food, babe.

385
00:52:35,995 --> 00:52:38,031
Why don't you add meat to your diet?

386
00:52:38,355 --> 00:52:41,153
No, thanks. I hate frog legs.

387
00:52:48,795 --> 00:52:49,989
You want?

388
00:52:50,515 --> 00:52:51,789
Thank you.

389
00:52:52,155 --> 00:52:53,383
Fellow garbage-belly.

390
00:53:00,075 --> 00:53:01,303
So how you doing?

391
00:53:01,555 --> 00:53:02,749
All right. What about you?

392
00:53:02,995 --> 00:53:04,110
Not bad.

393
00:53:06,155 --> 00:53:07,429
Where are we going?

394
00:53:07,675 --> 00:53:11,190
You're going to have to ask Cobra.
He's the expert on this.

395
00:53:12,355 --> 00:53:14,630
He doesn't look like an expert, does he?

396
00:53:14,875 --> 00:53:18,265
I know. He looks like
a fugitive from the '50s...

397
00:53:18,515 --> 00:53:20,665
...but he sure is great
at catching psychos.

398
00:53:20,915 --> 00:53:23,065
He's the pride of the zombie squad.

399
00:53:23,875 --> 00:53:24,944
What's the zombie squad?

400
00:53:25,515 --> 00:53:27,187
The bottom line.

401
00:53:28,515 --> 00:53:29,470
Want to have some fun?

402
00:53:30,755 --> 00:53:32,791
It's kind of personal...

403
00:53:33,035 --> 00:53:34,946
...but it might cheer him up.

404
00:53:35,195 --> 00:53:36,674
Walk up to him...

405
00:53:36,995 --> 00:53:38,428
...and call him....

406
00:53:40,195 --> 00:53:41,867
He likes that.

407
00:53:48,195 --> 00:53:49,628
Hot item.

408
00:53:50,675 --> 00:53:52,347
Did you find out anything new?

409
00:53:52,915 --> 00:53:55,304
Since you were in the bathroom?
No, not really.

410
00:53:56,235 --> 00:53:57,304
I did.

411
00:53:57,555 --> 00:53:58,670
Like what?

412
00:53:58,915 --> 00:54:00,348
Marion Cobretti.

413
00:54:01,195 --> 00:54:02,992
Is that really your name?

414
00:54:03,875 --> 00:54:05,786
Gonzales talks too much, doesn't he?

415
00:54:07,235 --> 00:54:08,748
It's not so bad.

416
00:54:10,955 --> 00:54:12,707
It's kind of tough growing up with.

417
00:54:13,955 --> 00:54:15,274
-I like it.
-Do you?

418
00:54:16,435 --> 00:54:18,869
I always wanted to have
a tougher one myself.

419
00:54:19,115 --> 00:54:20,753
You know, a little harder name.

420
00:54:20,995 --> 00:54:22,144
Like what?

421
00:54:22,955 --> 00:54:23,910
Alice.

422
00:54:27,795 --> 00:54:29,467
We'd better get going.

423
00:54:31,915 --> 00:54:33,314
Sorry, no sale.

424
00:55:31,435 --> 00:55:33,665
Your entrée is ready.

425
00:55:35,515 --> 00:55:36,994
It's for the large family.

426
00:55:37,235 --> 00:55:38,987
It sure is.

427
00:55:52,675 --> 00:55:53,994
You have a life preserver?

428
00:55:54,715 --> 00:55:55,704
Why?

429
00:55:55,955 --> 00:55:58,310
Because your french fries
are drowning there.

430
00:56:01,795 --> 00:56:03,467
What is this place?

431
00:56:04,235 --> 00:56:05,987
It's a foundry town.

432
00:56:08,515 --> 00:56:09,868
Tell me something:

433
00:56:10,115 --> 00:56:11,343
Do you ever let go?

434
00:56:12,515 --> 00:56:13,470
Sure.

435
00:56:14,635 --> 00:56:16,193
Really?

436
00:56:16,435 --> 00:56:18,505
So what do you do to relax?

437
00:56:18,755 --> 00:56:20,234
Look for trouble.

438
00:56:21,195 --> 00:56:22,071
No, I mean...

439
00:56:22,315 --> 00:56:24,033
...do you ever get involved?

440
00:56:24,755 --> 00:56:25,744
With a woman?

441
00:56:26,355 --> 00:56:27,947
Yeah, a woman.

442
00:56:28,315 --> 00:56:30,385
A real woman?
A real live woman?

443
00:56:30,635 --> 00:56:33,274
I don't know.
Now and then. Nothing regular.

444
00:56:33,515 --> 00:56:34,425
Why?

445
00:56:35,395 --> 00:56:37,192
Let's just say that...

446
00:56:38,795 --> 00:56:41,263
...not many people could
put up with the way I live.

447
00:56:42,315 --> 00:56:44,067
What if you found one?

448
00:56:46,155 --> 00:56:48,874
I'd say she'd have to be
a little crazy.

449
00:57:53,595 --> 00:57:54,914
I've got to go.

450
00:58:00,035 --> 00:58:01,184
You scared me.

451
00:58:01,955 --> 00:58:03,104
Where's Tony?

452
00:58:03,755 --> 00:58:06,792
He's asleep. I was just
checking on things at home.

453
00:58:07,875 --> 00:58:09,786
Why not use the phone in your room?

454
00:58:10,195 --> 00:58:11,184
It's out of order.

455
00:58:11,435 --> 00:58:15,348
-It's getting cold out here, huh?
-Yeah. Better get inside.

456
00:58:15,915 --> 00:58:19,988
Maybe it doesn't mean much,
but I think you're doing a great job.

457
00:58:20,235 --> 00:58:21,145
You too.

458
00:59:37,115 --> 00:59:38,628
Can't you sleep?

459
00:59:39,395 --> 00:59:40,669
Not really.

460
00:59:42,155 --> 00:59:43,065
You should try.

461
00:59:49,035 --> 00:59:51,390
-I can still hear.
-What?

462
00:59:52,035 --> 00:59:53,787
That your eyes are open.

463
00:59:55,235 --> 00:59:56,463
Who can sleep?

464
01:00:00,515 --> 01:00:02,949
Would you come over here, please?

465
01:00:06,435 --> 01:00:08,027
I won't hurt you.

466
01:00:13,155 --> 01:00:14,588
Sure, why not?

467
01:00:18,955 --> 01:00:21,389
Yeah, I guess I'll be pretty safe.

468
01:00:27,155 --> 01:00:29,510
Where will you go
when this is all done?

469
01:00:31,035 --> 01:00:33,469
I don't know. Maybe another case.

470
01:00:35,115 --> 01:00:38,107
We'll see each other some more
when this is over, right?

471
01:00:40,315 --> 01:00:42,067
You think that's a good idea?

472
01:00:42,395 --> 01:00:44,306
I think it might be.

473
01:00:50,235 --> 01:00:52,191
I'll go check the window.

474
01:01:06,955 --> 01:01:09,423
I think it might be a very good idea.

475
01:02:28,355 --> 01:02:29,310
Morning.

476
01:02:29,555 --> 01:02:30,544
Hi.

477
01:02:34,595 --> 01:02:35,710
Where we going today?

478
01:02:35,955 --> 01:02:37,627
Further upstate.

479
01:02:37,955 --> 01:02:40,594
We better check on Stalk,
see why she isn't out here.

480
01:02:40,995 --> 01:02:42,587
Better get in the car.

481
01:02:42,995 --> 01:02:44,633
What's wrong?
You look so mad.

482
01:02:45,115 --> 01:02:47,106
I always look this way
before breakfast.

483
01:02:47,755 --> 01:02:48,983
-She's gone, man.
-What?

484
01:02:49,235 --> 01:02:50,270
Gone.

485
01:02:53,635 --> 01:02:54,431
Get inside.

486
01:02:56,635 --> 01:02:57,863
Get inside!

487
01:03:06,955 --> 01:03:08,024
Never liked that bitch.

488
01:03:08,275 --> 01:03:09,628
Me either.

489
01:03:09,995 --> 01:03:11,394
Get in the house.

490
01:03:14,635 --> 01:03:15,988
Get down over there.

491
01:04:51,915 --> 01:04:52,870
Come on!

492
01:05:22,195 --> 01:05:23,389
Tony!

493
01:06:40,115 --> 01:06:41,025
What do I do?

494
01:06:42,915 --> 01:06:44,234
Go through it!

495
01:06:44,475 --> 01:06:45,351
Keep going!

496
01:07:04,675 --> 01:07:06,267
Come on, let's go!

497
01:07:29,515 --> 01:07:31,028
Go to the foundry.

498
01:11:15,915 --> 01:11:18,031
You have the right to remain silent.

499
01:11:33,035 --> 01:11:33,990
Die, bitch!

500
01:11:47,955 --> 01:11:49,274
Get out of there!

501
01:12:45,355 --> 01:12:47,425
Let's bleed, pig!

502
01:12:49,315 --> 01:12:50,270
Where are you?

503
01:12:55,715 --> 01:12:57,706
I want your eyes, pig!

504
01:12:58,755 --> 01:13:00,234
I want them!

505
01:13:01,275 --> 01:13:02,993
You want to go to hell?

506
01:13:07,715 --> 01:13:09,865
You want to go to hell with me?

507
01:13:11,075 --> 01:13:12,872
It doesn't matter, does it?

508
01:13:13,475 --> 01:13:15,705
We are the hunters.

509
01:13:16,275 --> 01:13:17,549
We kill the weak...

510
01:13:17,795 --> 01:13:19,592
...so the strong survive.

511
01:13:20,395 --> 01:13:22,465
You can't stop the New World.

512
01:13:22,715 --> 01:13:25,787
Your filthy society will never
get rid of people like us.

513
01:13:26,875 --> 01:13:28,547
It's breeding them.

514
01:13:28,795 --> 01:13:30,433
We are the future!

515
01:13:33,795 --> 01:13:35,433
You're history.

516
01:13:38,115 --> 01:13:40,470
You won't do it, pig.

517
01:13:41,195 --> 01:13:42,787
You won't shoot.

518
01:13:43,715 --> 01:13:46,593
Murder is against the law.

519
01:13:48,555 --> 01:13:50,671
You have to take me in.

520
01:13:51,635 --> 01:13:52,750
If...

521
01:13:52,995 --> 01:13:54,348
...you can.

522
01:13:56,195 --> 01:13:58,425
Even I have rights...

523
01:13:58,955 --> 01:14:00,673
...don't I...

524
01:14:01,035 --> 01:14:02,388
...pig?

525
01:14:04,035 --> 01:14:05,593
Take me in.

526
01:14:07,075 --> 01:14:08,906
They'll say I'm insane.

527
01:14:09,755 --> 01:14:11,473
Won't they?

528
01:14:12,795 --> 01:14:15,025
The court is civilized...

529
01:14:15,275 --> 01:14:16,833
...isn't it...

530
01:14:17,075 --> 01:14:18,269
...pig?

531
01:14:18,755 --> 01:14:20,586
But I'm not.

532
01:14:21,635 --> 01:14:24,069
This is where the law stops...

533
01:14:24,595 --> 01:14:26,506
...and I start...

534
01:14:28,995 --> 01:14:30,144
...sucker!

535
01:14:53,035 --> 01:14:54,753
Come on, pig.

536
01:17:15,275 --> 01:17:16,503
You okay?

537
01:17:17,635 --> 01:17:18,954
You sure?

538
01:17:19,955 --> 01:17:21,388
Let's get out of here.

539
01:17:34,115 --> 01:17:37,903
Come on, you did your best.
Don't feel guilty.

540
01:17:38,355 --> 01:17:41,711
That's nice of you.
You going to be all right?

541
01:17:41,955 --> 01:17:44,423
I'm going to miss the dance finals.

542
01:17:45,635 --> 01:17:47,387
Listen, can I get you anything?

543
01:17:47,635 --> 01:17:48,784
Yeah.

544
01:17:49,075 --> 01:17:51,270
I would kill for some....

545
01:17:51,795 --> 01:17:52,864
What?

546
01:17:53,355 --> 01:17:54,754
Gummy Bears.

547
01:17:55,235 --> 01:17:56,224
Gummy Bears?

548
01:17:59,115 --> 01:18:00,309
See you at the hospital.

549
01:18:00,555 --> 01:18:03,149
-Keep in touch.
-Don't drive too fast.

550
01:18:12,075 --> 01:18:13,872
You did a hell of a job here.

551
01:18:14,475 --> 01:18:17,467
You ever want a transfer
to something easier...

552
01:18:17,715 --> 01:18:18,989
...or you need anything...

553
01:18:19,235 --> 01:18:20,668
...just say the word.

554
01:18:22,995 --> 01:18:25,555
I would like to have my car replaced.

555
01:18:26,395 --> 01:18:29,193
We'd like to,
but it's not in the budget.

556
01:18:31,355 --> 01:18:34,904
See you back at headquarters.
I'll take care of your toy for you.

557
01:18:40,355 --> 01:18:42,073
No hard feelings.

558
01:18:43,155 --> 01:18:45,305
You kind of overdid it around here.

559
01:18:45,755 --> 01:18:47,313
I personally would have...

560
01:18:47,555 --> 01:18:50,592
...a more subtle solution,
but that's not your style.

561
01:18:51,195 --> 01:18:52,753
No hard feelings.

562
01:19:06,435 --> 01:19:08,710
No hard feelings, pal.

563
01:19:14,435 --> 01:19:15,550
I'll give you a lift.

564
01:19:15,795 --> 01:19:18,104
No, I've got my own
transportation, thanks.

565
01:19:18,595 --> 01:19:19,710
You ready?

566
01:19:19,955 --> 01:19:21,786
Ready, Marion.

567
01:19:22,875 --> 01:19:24,513
Catchy name, isn't it?

568
01:23:29,715 --> 01:23:30,704
