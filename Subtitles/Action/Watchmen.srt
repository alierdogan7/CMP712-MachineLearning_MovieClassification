172
00:20:27,593 --> 00:20:30,562
You can give it up,
try and have a normal life.

173
00:20:30,729 --> 00:20:34,631
That what you have now?
A normal life?

174
00:20:35,634 --> 00:20:39,001
When you walk down the street
in a city dying of rabies...

175
00:20:39,171 --> 00:20:40,638
...past the human cockroaches...

176
00:20:40,806 --> 00:20:43,570
...talking about their heroin
and child pornography...

177
00:20:43,742 --> 00:20:45,266
...do you really feel normal?

178
00:20:46,411 --> 00:20:49,175
Least I'm not the one
still hiding behind a mask.

179
00:20:51,049 --> 00:20:52,311
No.

180
00:20:53,986 --> 00:20:56,113
You're hiding in plain sight.

181
00:20:57,489 --> 00:20:59,650
Be seeing you, Dan.

182
00:21:00,158 --> 00:21:02,626
A maintenance hatch
will let you out two blocks north.

183
00:21:02,794 --> 00:21:04,523
Yeah, I remember.

184
00:21:04,696 --> 00:21:08,757
Came here often,
when we were partners.

185
00:21:08,934 --> 00:21:10,834
DAN: Those were great times, huh,
Rorschach?

186
00:21:11,336 --> 00:21:14,567
- What happened?
- You quit.

187
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:42,824
MAN:
<i>Mr. Veidt...</i>

188
00:21:43,602 --> 00:21:45,763
...to date,
you're one of only two Watchmen...

189
00:21:45,937 --> 00:21:48,371
...ever to reveal their true identity
to the world...

190
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:50,474
...the first being Hollis Mason.

191
00:21:50,642 --> 00:21:53,634
And you've certainly profited greatly
by it...

192
00:21:53,812 --> 00:21:59,079
...turning your superhero alter ego,
Ozymandias, into a billion-dollar industry:

193
00:21:59,251 --> 00:22:02,311
Toys, lunchboxes, genetic engineering.

194
00:22:02,487 --> 00:22:04,546
I understand there's a movie
in the works.

195
00:22:04,723 --> 00:22:08,921
- I'm not hearing a question, Mr. Roth.
ROTH: I'm sorry. Do you think...

196
00:22:09,094 --> 00:22:11,654
The Watchmen resent me
for prostituting their struggle?

197
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:14,560
It's a fair question.
Yes, it's crossed my mind...

198
00:22:14,733 --> 00:22:17,759
...some of my old colleagues
might see it that way...

199
00:22:17,936 --> 00:22:20,928
...just as you're clearly aware
that biased journalism...

200
00:22:21,106 --> 00:22:23,700
...sells more magazines.

201
00:22:24,209 --> 00:22:28,976
The merchandising arm of Veidt Industries
is funding our work with Dr. Manhattan.

202
00:22:29,147 --> 00:22:32,082
We recently expanded our research facility
in Antarctica...

203
00:22:32,250 --> 00:22:35,481
...in the hope of developing cheap,
renewable sources of energy...

204
00:22:35,654 --> 00:22:38,646
...that we might eliminate
the world's reliance on fossil fuels.

205
00:22:38,824 --> 00:22:41,258
Now, it doesn't take
a political scientist...

206
00:22:41,426 --> 00:22:44,827
...to see that our Cold War
with the Russians isn't ideological...

207
00:22:44,996 --> 00:22:48,488
...it's based upon fear.
Fear of not having enough.

208
00:22:48,867 --> 00:22:52,564
But if we make resources infinite...

209
00:22:52,738 --> 00:22:54,831
...ah...

210
00:22:55,006 --> 00:22:57,099
...we make war obsolete.

211
00:22:57,943 --> 00:23:01,777
I would hope the other Watchmen
understand that...

212
00:23:02,981 --> 00:23:04,642
...wherever they may be.

213
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:08,117
Thanks for your time.

214
00:23:14,359 --> 00:23:17,021
- You look good, Adrian.
- Dan.

215
00:23:17,195 --> 00:23:19,425
It's been too long.

216
00:23:21,166 --> 00:23:25,227
So Rorschach thinks
someone's hunting the Watchmen, huh?

217
00:23:25,904 --> 00:23:27,769
You think it's possible?

218
00:23:27,939 --> 00:23:30,669
Statistically, one murder
doesn't equal a trend.

219
00:23:31,810 --> 00:23:33,778
Rorschach's a sociopath, Dan.

220
00:23:34,413 --> 00:23:37,780
And so was the Comedian.
He was practically a Nazi.

221
00:23:38,617 --> 00:23:40,642
You know that better than anyone.

222
00:23:40,819 --> 00:23:43,014
I'm not here because I miss him.

223
00:23:43,188 --> 00:23:44,519
It's occurred to Rorschach...

224
00:23:44,689 --> 00:23:47,658
...that we're the only ones
who know each other's identities.

225
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:50,253
Actually, the whole world knows yours.

226
00:23:51,029 --> 00:23:53,497
That's why I'm warning you first.

227
00:23:57,102 --> 00:23:59,093
Thank you, Dan...

228
00:24:00,705 --> 00:24:04,505
...but I fear there's something
much more real to worry about...

229
00:24:04,676 --> 00:24:07,270
...than Rorschach's mask killer.

230
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:13,308
If the Russians do launch their nukes,
can Jon really stop them?

231
00:24:13,485 --> 00:24:17,114
The Soviets have 51,000
warheads stockpiled.

232
00:24:17,289 --> 00:24:20,486
Even if Jon stops 99 percent of them...

233
00:24:20,659 --> 00:24:24,857
...the 1 percent that get through
could still kill every living thing on Earth.

234
00:24:27,599 --> 00:24:29,965
Even Dr. Manhattan
can't be everywhere at once.

235
00:24:44,216 --> 00:24:49,848
<i>Rorschach's journal,</i>
<i>October 13th, 1985...</i>

236
00:24:50,021 --> 00:24:52,353
<i>...8:30 p.m.</i>

237
00:24:53,058 --> 00:24:56,960
<i>Meeting with Dreiberg</i>
<i>left bad taste in mouth.</i>

238

<i>A flabby failure who sits</i>

239
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:05,369
<i>Why are so few of us left active...</i>

240
00:25:05,537 --> 00:25:10,406
<i>...healthy and without</i>

241

251
00:25:47,345 --> 00:25:49,677

<i>I shall go tell the indestructible man</i>

253
00:26:03,228 --> 00:26:05,025
JON:
Good evening, Rorschach.

254
00:26:05,196 --> 00:26:08,688
RORSCHACH:
Dr. Manhattan, you know why I'm here.

255
00:26:08,867 --> 00:26:10,300
JON:
Yes...

256
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:13,538
...but you're going to leave disappointed.

257
00:26:13,705 --> 00:26:17,436
Rorschach. You shouldn't be here.
You're a wanted man.

258
00:26:17,609 --> 00:26:19,804
RORSCHACH:
Nice to see you too, Silk Spectre.

259
00:26:19,978 --> 00:26:22,037
I have a real name I've been using.

260
00:26:22,213 --> 00:26:23,237
Try it.

261
00:26:23,415 --> 00:26:25,508
Whatever you say, Laurie.

262
00:26:25,684 --> 00:26:26,912
What are you doing here?

263
00:26:27,085 --> 00:26:29,417
JON:
The Comedian is dead.

264
00:26:29,588 --> 00:26:31,681
Rorschach wants me
to look into my future...

265
00:26:32,023 --> 00:26:34,491
...see if the killer is ever
publicly identified.

266
00:26:34,659 --> 00:26:37,753
Already warned Dreiberg.
Came to warn you too.

267
00:26:40,465 --> 00:26:42,831
Even if I wanted to help...

268
00:26:43,435 --> 00:26:47,337
...my future is blocked
by some kind of temporal interference.

269
00:26:47,739 --> 00:26:51,800
- I cannot see it clearly.
- Interference? Caused by what?

270
00:26:51,977 --> 00:26:55,378
In all likelihood, nuclear holocaust.

271
00:26:56,114 --> 00:27:00,210
If the United States and Soviet Union
engage in all-out war...

272
00:27:00,385 --> 00:27:04,378
...the resulting blast wave would produce
a sudden burst of tachyons...

273
00:27:04,556 --> 00:27:09,516
...particles which travel backward
through what you perceive as time...

274
00:27:10,161 --> 00:27:13,494
...therefore obscuring my vision
of the present.

275
00:27:14,299 --> 00:27:15,698
I must return to my work.

276
00:27:15,867 --> 00:27:16,993
RORSCHACH:
Wait a minute.

277
00:27:17,168 --> 00:27:19,659
What if that's why
someone wants us out of the way?

278
00:27:19,838 --> 00:27:22,068
So we can't do anything to stop it?

279
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:24,071
Goodbye, Rorschach.

280
00:27:24,242 --> 00:27:26,506
RORSCHACH: Took a lot of effort
to get in here to see you.

281
00:27:26,678 --> 00:27:28,009
I'm not leaving...

282
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:31,612
- till I've had my say.

283
00:27:39,124 --> 00:27:42,059
Seems like there's a lot of things
you don't tell me these days.

284
00:27:42,227 --> 00:27:44,923
I didn't wanna worry you prematurely.

285
00:27:45,397 --> 00:27:49,527
If Adrian and I can solve the energy crisis,
war may be averted.

286
00:27:49,701 --> 00:27:51,760
LAURIE:
But you always say time is simultaneous.

287
00:27:52,470 --> 00:27:55,337
If that's true,
then how can you change the future?

288
00:27:55,507 --> 00:28:00,501
If only you could perceive time as I do.

289
00:28:00,679 --> 00:28:01,941
Please let me show you.

290
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:12,856
Magic. Dreams. That is what I had before.
I was a hero, goddamn it!

291
00:28:13,024 --> 00:28:16,084
It's not my fault you got old.
What do you have to complain about?

292
00:28:16,261 --> 00:28:18,695
I'm putting food on the table
for you and your child.

293
00:28:18,863 --> 00:28:21,627
Call your friend Eddie.
Maybe he can give you a better life.

294
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:25,964
- It was a mistake. One time.
- Man tries to rape you...

295
00:28:26,271 --> 00:28:27,636
Stop!

296
00:28:28,406 --> 00:28:29,873
Your mind goes to dark places...

297
00:28:30,041 --> 00:28:32,373
...and you wonder
why I keep the worst from you.

298
00:28:36,314 --> 00:28:39,750
- Say hello to Dan for me.
- What?

299
00:28:41,519 --> 00:28:44,317
You wanna ask me
to go to dinner with you...

300
00:28:46,024 --> 00:28:48,185
...like we used to...

301
00:28:49,627 --> 00:28:50,753
...but you won't.

302
00:28:51,529 --> 00:28:53,793
You know I can't.

303
00:28:56,434 --> 00:28:58,698
So you'll call Dan...

304
00:28:59,137 --> 00:29:01,332
...which is only natural.

305
00:29:01,673 --> 00:29:04,267
You deserve the comfort of an old friend.

306
00:29:38,576 --> 00:29:40,100
LAURIE:
Dan Dreiberg's table.

307
00:30:01,266 --> 00:30:05,032
DAN: Did you know that
he and H.J. were...? I had no idea.

308
00:30:05,537 --> 00:30:08,597
You remember that crazy guy?
What'd he call himself?

309
00:30:08,773 --> 00:30:10,263
Captain Carnage.

310
00:30:10,441 --> 00:30:13,638
Used to pretend he was a supervillain
just so he could get beat up?

311
00:30:13,812 --> 00:30:16,212
Yeah, he tried that on me once.
I just walked away.

312
00:30:16,381 --> 00:30:19,407
He starts following me down the street
in broad daylight...

313
00:30:19,584 --> 00:30:22,382
...yelling, "Punish me! Punish me!"

314
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:25,145
I'm just saying, "No, get lost."

315
00:30:26,291 --> 00:30:28,759
God, whatever happened to him?

316
00:30:28,927 --> 00:30:31,088
Oh. Um...
He pulled that on Rorschach...

317
00:30:31,262 --> 00:30:33,662
...and Rorschach
dropped him down an elevator shaft.

318
00:30:40,138 --> 00:30:42,538
Oh, my God. That's not even funny.

319
00:30:43,241 --> 00:30:45,732
- It's a little funny.
- Yep.

320
00:30:47,645 --> 00:30:49,613
WOMAN: I'm glad I ordered
the four-legged chicken.

321
00:30:49,781 --> 00:30:51,749
It's really good to see you again.

322
00:30:52,984 --> 00:30:54,508
It's great seeing you too.

323
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:57,845
Why'd we do it, Dan? Dress up like that?

324
00:30:58,990 --> 00:31:02,323
- No one else would.
- Yeah, but do you remember my costume?

325
00:31:02,493 --> 00:31:05,587
All that tight latex?
I mean, it was awful.

326
00:31:05,763 --> 00:31:08,732
Uh... Yeah, yeah, awful.

327
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:11,334
But didn't wanna disappoint Mother.

328
00:31:11,502 --> 00:31:15,495
Wanted her little girl to be just like her
and fight bad guys.

329
00:31:16,174 --> 00:31:19,769
I think the Keene Act was the best thing
that ever happened to us.

330
00:31:20,845 --> 00:31:23,211
Well, we'll live longer anyway.

331
00:31:26,517 --> 00:31:28,041
What?

332
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:33,514
Jon thinks, unless he can do something
about it...

333
00:31:34,359 --> 00:31:36,384
...that there's gonna be nuclear war.

334
00:31:36,861 --> 00:31:38,351
Soon.

335
00:31:39,230 --> 00:31:42,563
But I don't know what to think.
I mean, it's all...

336
00:31:42,734 --> 00:31:45,794
...quantum mechanics
and parallel realities with him.

337
00:31:45,970 --> 00:31:48,734

Ms. Black, you have the first question.

Dr. Manhattan, as you know...

685
01:00:27,190 --> 01:00:29,886
...the Doomsday Clock
is a symbolic clock face...

686
01:00:30,059 --> 01:00:33,620

to extinction...

of nuclear war.

that time is relative.

692

I would only agree
that a symbolic clock...

693
01:00:54,651 --> 01:00:56,642
...is as nourishing to the intellect...

694
01:00:56,819 --> 01:01:00,084

It doesn't matter.

1693
02:31:37,817 --> 02:31:43,084
People's lives take them strange places.
They do strange things...

1694
02:31:43,656 --> 02:31:46,591
...and, well,
sometimes they can't talk about them.

1695
02:31:46,759 --> 02:31:49,091
I know how that is...

1696
02:31:49,829 --> 02:31:52,423
...but I just want you to know...

1697
02:31:52,999 --> 02:31:55,832
...that you never did anything wrong
by me.

1698
02:32:00,006 --> 02:32:04,272
You asked me why I wasn't mad at him.

1699
02:32:05,845 --> 02:32:08,336
Because he gave me you.

1700
02:32:13,353 --> 02:32:14,445
Thanks, Mom.

1701
02:32:17,190 --> 02:32:18,987
I love you.

1702
02:32:26,532 --> 02:32:30,730
- Hello, Miss Jupiter.
- Oh, Sally, please.

1703
02:32:32,372 --> 02:32:36,968
Excuse me. Gotta go freshen up.
I'll be right back.

1704
02:32:47,487 --> 02:32:51,651
- So how's it going up here?
- Good. How's it going down there?

1705
02:32:51,824 --> 02:32:55,316
Good. I think I've got everything working.

1706
02:32:55,495 --> 02:33:00,125
All of Archie's systems are upgraded.
Finished the tinkering for now...

1707
02:33:00,299 --> 02:33:02,529
...so all we gotta do is take her out.

1708
02:33:02,702 --> 02:33:05,762
Well, that sounds like a date.

1709
02:33:17,083 --> 02:33:19,347
Are we gonna be all right?

1710
02:33:21,421 --> 02:33:25,721
Long as people think Jon's
still watching us, we'll be all right...

1711
02:33:25,925 --> 02:33:27,790
...in the end.

1712
02:33:29,429 --> 02:33:31,590
I know what Jon would say:

1713
02:33:31,764 --> 02:33:33,789
Nothing ends.

1714
02:33:35,701 --> 02:33:38,295
Nothing ever ends.

1715
02:34:25,651 --> 02:34:29,417
Seymour, we got nothing
to write about anymore.

1716
02:34:29,589 --> 02:34:30,954
Everyone in the country...

1717
02:34:31,124 --> 02:34:33,388
...every country in the world
are holding hands...

1718
02:34:33,559 --> 02:34:36,824
...and singing songs
about peace and love.

1719
02:34:37,330 --> 02:34:40,197
It's like living in a goddamn
global hippie commune.

1720
02:34:40,366 --> 02:34:44,302
Well, Ronald Reagan says he's gonna
be running for president in '88.

1721
02:34:44,470 --> 02:34:46,301
We could run a piece on that.

1722
02:34:46,472 --> 02:34:49,635
Seymour, we don't dignify absurdities
with coverage.

1723
02:34:49,809 --> 02:34:53,643
This is still America, damn it.
Who wants a cowboy in the White House?

1724
02:34:54,380 --> 02:34:58,612
Okay. I could look for something
in the crank file.

1725
02:34:58,784 --> 02:35:00,376
Crank file.

1726
02:35:00,553 --> 02:35:02,544
Whatever. Take some initiative.

1727
02:35:02,722 --> 02:35:05,350
Run whatever you like.
I leave it entirely in your hands.

1728
02:35:11,864 --> 02:35:16,563
<i>Rorschach's journal, October 12th, 1985.</i>

1729
02:35:16,736 --> 02:35:21,196
<i>Tonight, a comedian died in New York.</i>
