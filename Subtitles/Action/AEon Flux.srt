- Meet me there in two hours.
- Where are you going?

541
00:54:08,141 --> 00:54:10,496
- I have to find her before they do.
- Trevor...

542
00:54:10,621 --> 00:54:12,771
TREVOR: Freya, I'll see you at the lab.

543
00:54:13,581 --> 00:54:15,333

TREVOR: You're right.

548
00:54:31,261 --> 00:54:32,580
WOMAN: Please don't hurt my baby.

549
00:54:32,701 --> 00:54:33,816
She's safe.

550
00:54:35,981 --> 00:54:37,414
You cloned her?

551
00:54:38,261 --> 00:54:39,899
I cloned everybody.

552
00:54:42,181 --> 00:54:45,856
There was a complication
when we cured the industrial disease.

553
00:54:47,501 --> 00:54:50,140
TREVOR: The vaccine had
an unintended side effect.

554
00:54:52,101 --> 00:54:53,329
Sterility.

555
00:54:54,101 --> 00:54:57,377
Only one more generation
of our species could survive.

556
00:54:58,341 --> 00:54:59,774
It was a desperate time.

557
00:54:59,901 --> 00:55:01,175
It's our responsibility...

558
00:55:01,301 --> 00:55:04,657
Cloning had never been used
on humans successfully.

560
00:55:09,101 --> 00:55:10,614
But we succeeded.

561
00:55:12,901 --> 00:55:16,735
Now, when a person dies,
their DNA is recycled.

562
00:55:16,861 --> 00:55:19,739
Oren and I built the Relical
to store the DNA...

563
00:55:19,861 --> 00:55:21,738
and conceal the cloning process.

564
00:55:22,101 --> 00:55:24,695
The Keeper finds a suitable couple...

565
00:55:25,301 --> 00:55:28,737
and, using food additives,
we induce a chemical pregnancy.

566
00:55:30,421 --> 00:55:34,209
When the woman comes in for an exam,
we implant a cloned embryo.

567
00:55:34,621 --> 00:55:36,657
From there, things happen naturally.

568
00:55:37,181 --> 00:55:40,810
In nine months,
a citizen who died is reborn.

569
00:55:43,141 --> 00:55:46,417
For seven generations,
Oren and I have cloned ourselves...

I could keep trying to find a cure...

We're more than that.

575
00:56:09,181 --> 00:56:11,536
It wasn't supposed to be permanent.

I've been trying to cure the infertility.

577
00:56:20,301 --> 00:56:22,769
Una was part of one of my test groups.

578
00:56:23,421 --> 00:56:24,934
Oren lied to me.

579
00:56:25,221 --> 00:56:28,133
He told me her test had failed
like the others.

580
00:56:28,821 --> 00:56:30,857
But she had become pregnant.

581
00:56:34,021 --> 00:56:36,216
He killed all of the subjects.

582
00:56:37,061 --> 00:56:38,733
Your sister included.

583
00:56:41,301 --> 00:56:43,815
He killed her
because she was pregnant.

584

Una didn't know it...

585
00:56:50,901 --> 00:56:54,974
but her baby would've been one
of the first new children in 400 years.

Oren's changed.

587

He doesn't want a cure.

than any of this.

01:09:41,365 --> 01:09:43,321
Living like this is torture.

720
01:09:43,445 --> 01:09:45,003
We're just ghosts.

721
01:09:46,965 --> 01:09:48,523
That's not how I feel.

722
01:09:50,685 --> 01:09:51,720
Not now.

723
01:09:59,525 --> 01:10:01,038
Let's be careful.

724
01:10:01,525 --> 01:10:03,641
You know who we're up against.

725
01:10:09,805 --> 01:10:12,683
- This is an empty gesture.
- It's a leap of faith.

726
01:10:12,805 --> 01:10:14,761
It's not for you to decide.

727
01:10:15,725 --> 01:10:19,081
Aeon, I don't want to lose you again.

728
01:10:20,445 --> 01:10:22,037
You don't have to.

729
01:10:23,245 --> 01:10:25,201
You'll find the cure again.

730
01:10:26,525 --> 01:10:28,117
OREN: It's over, Trevor.

731
01:10:35,525 --> 01:10:37,959
WEAVER: Moving into position
on the south spire.

732
01:10:40,645 --> 01:10:43,113
It goes so much deeper than your cure.

733
01:10:43,645 --> 01:10:46,205
Other women have been
getting pregnant naturally...

734
01:10:46,325 --> 01:10:48,316
outside of your experiments.

735
01:10:48,525 --> 01:10:50,277
More and more of them.

736
01:10:51,365 --> 01:10:53,162
They healed themselves.

737
01:10:54,125 --> 01:10:56,878
- And you killed them, too?
- I had to stop it.

738
01:10:57,765 --> 01:10:58,993
How many?

739
01:11:03,245 --> 01:11:04,439
How many, Oren?

740
01:11:05,165 --> 01:11:08,282
It doesn't matter.
Nature's finally found a way.

741
01:11:11,445 --> 01:11:13,117
- In position.
- In position.

742
01:11:13,245 --> 01:11:14,519
GARDENER: Position acquired.

743
01:11:14,885 --> 01:11:17,683
Nature's the one who's obsolete, not us.

744
01:11:18,925 --> 01:11:22,918
OREN: How can you not understand
the beauty of what you made? I do.

745
01:11:24,205 --> 01:11:25,797
Situation's getting complicated.

746
01:11:32,365 --> 01:11:34,401
You told me she was gone.

747
01:11:38,725 --> 01:11:40,443
There was nothing that they could do.

748
01:11:43,965 --> 01:11:46,001
I ordered her DNA destroyed.

749
01:11:47,525 --> 01:11:49,800
You were a different man
with her, Trevor.

750
01:11:49,925 --> 01:11:52,962
She would've stopped you
from doing what needed to be done.

751
01:11:54,045 --> 01:11:55,842
- Like she's stopping you now.
- No, Oren.

752
01:11:55,965 --> 01:11:56,954
Yes.

753
01:11:57,285 --> 01:11:59,037
- Waiting for the go.
- On my signal.

754
01:11:59,165 --> 01:12:01,281
This world, our world, is beautiful.

755
01:12:01,925 --> 01:12:03,916
Worth preserving at any cost.

756
01:12:04,045 --> 01:12:06,354
It can't last. It's falling apart.

757
01:12:10,125 --> 01:12:11,922
WEAVER: Sithandra, give us the signal.

758
01:12:13,805 --> 01:12:16,080
- Sithandra.
- Take Flux down first.

759
01:12:16,205 --> 01:12:17,240
You're wrong in this, Oren.

760
01:12:17,365 --> 01:12:19,640
We've beaten death, beaten nature.

761
01:12:20,805 --> 01:12:22,397
We've gone beyond you.

762
01:12:23,045 --> 01:12:24,956
And now I need to be free of you.

763
01:12:34,805 --> 01:12:35,840
Wait.

764
01:12:48,325 --> 01:12:49,599
Sithandra.

765
01:12:53,685 --> 01:12:56,324
You chose this, Aeon. It's too late.

766
01:12:56,685 --> 01:12:58,641
You know how much we're all suffering.

767
01:12:58,765 --> 01:13:00,995
I'm trying to end it, and so is Trevor.

768
01:13:01,645 --> 01:13:03,476
I would never betray you.

769
01:13:04,045 --> 01:13:05,194
Help me.

770
01:13:07,285 --> 01:13:08,559
AEON: Sithandra.

771
01:13:09,685 --> 01:13:11,277
You still know me.

772
01:13:11,405 --> 01:13:12,633
HANDLER: Finish it.

773
01:13:13,525 --> 01:13:15,516
AEON: You can choose to trust me.

774
01:13:17,445 --> 01:13:18,560
[Gun cocking]

775
01:13:19,965 --> 01:13:21,080
Finish it.

776
01:13:21,205 --> 01:13:22,718
I'm sorry, Oren.

777
01:13:22,965 --> 01:13:23,954
I'm sorry.

778
01:13:24,085 --> 01:13:25,154
I am, too.

779
01:13:26,725 --> 01:13:28,044

780
01:13:29,925 --> 01:13:32,997

786
01:14:13,845 --> 01:14:15,073
Goodchild's been hit.

787
01:14:19,485 --> 01:14:21,077
SITHANDRA: Flux is headed
to the courtyard.

[Guns firing]

789
01:14:24,765 --> 01:14:26,039

797
01:16:36,845 --> 01:16:37,880
Oren.

798
01:17:10,325 --> 01:17:11,758
They're coming.

799
01:17:16,725 --> 01:17:17,840
Aeon.

800
01:17:37,085 --> 01:17:39,155
We're waiting for your orders.

801
01:17:39,645 --> 01:17:41,522
You're not part of this?

802
01:17:42,485 --> 01:17:44,953
Whatever we are, we're not anarchists.

803
01:17:45,365 --> 01:17:47,754
- There have to be rules.
- Thank you.

804
01:18:07,165 --> 01:18:08,359
[Beeping]

805
01:18:18,485 --> 01:18:19,964
You're the one.

806
01:18:20,725 --> 01:18:22,078
You saved me.

807
01:18:22,645 --> 01:18:23,634
Yes.

808
01:18:24,805 --> 01:18:26,284
KEEPER: I knew you then.

809
01:18:26,645 --> 01:18:29,159
This one was corrupted. Destroy it.

810
01:18:29,685 --> 01:18:31,596
I knew you were important.

811
01:18:32,245 --> 01:18:33,758
The DNA is good.

812
01:18:33,885 --> 01:18:35,113
Destroy it.

813
01:18:40,845 --> 01:18:43,234
KEEPER: I knew that I needed
to protect you.

814
01:18:45,005 --> 01:18:48,918
I kept your DNA hidden here, dormant.

815
01:18:49,525 --> 01:18:52,119
I've waited until now to bring you back.

816
01:18:52,445 --> 01:18:53,434
Why?

817
01:18:53,725 --> 01:18:58,401
I knew that your strength
would survive with you.

818
01:18:58,765 --> 01:19:02,394
I thought that if I brought you back,
you could reach Trevor.

819
01:19:03,765 --> 01:19:05,323
You always could.

820
01:19:06,605 --> 01:19:09,403
- I have to end it.
- Yes.

821
01:19:10,485 --> 01:19:11,679
Start over.

822
01:19:12,525 --> 01:19:13,958
What about you?

823
01:19:15,845 --> 01:19:18,917
I've waited 400 years for this day.

824
01:19:22,365 --> 01:19:23,593
I'm tired.

825
01:19:30,805 --> 01:19:32,363
Stay alive, Aeon.

826
01:19:34,445 --> 01:19:35,878
You are needed.

827
01:20:26,005 --> 01:20:27,154
Look!

830
01:21:31,965 --> 01:21:33,876
AEON: Now we can move forward...

831
01:21:35,005 --> 01:21:38,281
to live once for real...

832
01:21:40,205 --> 01:21:44,676
and then give way to people
who might do it better.

833
01:21:52,085 --> 01:21:53,757
Hey, Katherine.

834
01:21:57,365 --> 01:21:59,083
Will I see you again?

835
01:22:09,365 --> 01:22:11,037
AEON: To live only once...

836
01:22:16,125 --> 01:22:17,558
but with hope.
