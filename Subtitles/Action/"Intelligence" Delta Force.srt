[Dog barking]

7
00:01:08,635 --> 00:01:10,802
Weatherly: This is
the third opposition leader

8
00:01:10,804 --> 00:01:13,138
assassinated in Bolivia
in the past month.

9
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:14,908
The situation down there
has been a mess

10
00:01:14,909 --> 00:01:16,541
since President Carrizales
took over.

11
00:01:16,543 --> 00:01:18,176
So you think
that President Carrizales

12
00:01:18,178 --> 00:01:20,946
is taking out his enemies
to ensure his re-election?

13
00:01:20,948 --> 00:01:22,180
It appears that way.

14
00:01:22,182 --> 00:01:23,548
But many countries
are about to have

15
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:26,251
a renewed interest in Bolivia,
including the U.S.

16
00:01:26,253 --> 00:01:28,720
- Lithium.
- Exactly.

17
00:01:28,722 --> 00:01:30,522
Turns out that Bolivia sits
on the world's largest deposits.

18
00:01:30,524 --> 00:01:32,991
Every battery needs it.
Every cellphone needs it.

19
00:01:32,993 --> 00:01:35,694
The leader who controls Bolivia
will have the power

20
00:01:35,696 --> 00:01:39,664
to influence the most important
currency in the world... energy.

21
00:01:39,666 --> 00:01:41,666
And we're hoping that leader
will be Javier León.

22
00:01:41,668 --> 00:01:45,070
He's a moderate,
married to a schoolteacher...

23
00:01:45,072 --> 00:01:47,973
brother's a priest,
a man of the people,

24
00:01:47,975 --> 00:01:50,075
and someone we can work with.

25
00:01:50,077 --> 00:01:52,177
Who has a target on his back.

26
00:01:52,179 --> 00:01:54,779
The state department
is quietly sending

27
00:01:54,781 --> 00:01:57,582
the undersecretary of state
to meet with León in two days.

28
00:01:57,584 --> 00:02:00,518
It is imperative
that he remain alive.

29
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:02,287
I have an asset down there

30
00:02:02,289 --> 00:02:04,022
who can assist your team
when they arrive.

31
00:02:04,024 --> 00:02:08,059
Whoever the killer is,
he's good.

32
00:02:08,061 --> 00:02:11,930
And the president doesn't
want to take any chances.

33
00:02:17,269 --> 00:02:18,770
[Casings drop]

34
00:02:18,772 --> 00:02:20,271
Not bad. Not bad.

35
00:02:20,273 --> 00:02:22,574
Not bad?
I threaded the needle.

36
00:02:22,576 --> 00:02:24,943
Let me show you how it's done.

37
00:02:26,745 --> 00:02:28,546
[Sighs]

38
00:02:28,548 --> 00:02:31,082
Okay, I'm just gonna study
your form.

39

[Casings drop]

40
00:02:39,091 --> 00:02:41,059
Boom.
Mm-hmm.

41
00:02:41,061 --> 00:02:43,094
Mm, it looks like we have

42
00:02:43,096 --> 00:02:44,662
a bit of a runaway over there
on the left.

43
00:02:44,664 --> 00:02:46,764
Should we put out an A.P.B.?
It might have fled the state.

44

[Sighs] [Door opens]

45
00:02:47,767 --> 00:02:50,201
- You distracted me.
- Mm.

46
00:02:51,737 --> 00:02:54,405
- Jameson.
- Morning.

47
00:02:54,407 --> 00:02:57,742
I haven't seen you down here
in a while.

48
00:02:57,744 --> 00:03:00,011
I guess
he's shooting off memos.

49
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:04,282
Okay,
Special Agent Chris Jameson,

50
00:03:04,284 --> 00:03:05,750
let's see what you got.

51
00:03:15,527 --> 00:03:16,827
[Casings drop]

52
00:03:16,829 --> 00:03:19,697
That's how you shoot off
a memo.

53
00:03:19,699 --> 00:03:21,899
No strays.

54
00:03:24,903 --> 00:03:26,136
[Cellphone beeps]

55
00:03:26,138 --> 00:03:29,974
Lillian needs us
at C-Doc.

56
00:03:29,976 --> 00:03:31,609
Lillian:
This is a series of photos

57
00:03:31,611 --> 00:03:33,544
that was taken by an ATM
outside of LA Paz

58
00:03:33,546 --> 00:03:37,214
just moments after the vicente
assassination in the brothel.

59
00:03:37,216 --> 00:03:38,215
I know it's hard
to make him out here.

60
00:03:38,217 --> 00:03:40,050
We don't have
a positive I.D. yet,

61
00:03:40,052 --> 00:03:43,454
but we believe that
it's the same man seen here.

62
00:03:43,456 --> 00:03:46,190
Same hat, same jacket.

63
00:03:46,192 --> 00:03:49,660
And this was taken a little
while after the second killing.

64
00:03:49,662 --> 00:03:52,229
If he committed
three assassinations,

65
00:03:52,231 --> 00:03:54,198
we have every reason
to believe that he's the one

66
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:56,633
that's now targeting
Javier León.

67
00:03:56,635 --> 00:04:00,003
Gabriel.
Do you recognize him?

68
00:04:00,005 --> 00:04:02,873
- Yeah.
- Who is he?

69
00:04:02,875 --> 00:04:04,708
Lieutenant John Norris.

70
00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:08,478
- Lieutenant?
- Delta Force, tier 1.

71
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:09,746
Is the chip telling you that?

72
00:04:09,748 --> 00:04:12,582
Don't need the chip.

73
00:04:12,584 --> 00:04:14,518
He was my best friend.

74
00:04:23,728 --> 00:04:27,831
Lillian: Gabriel Vaughn, one of our nation's
most decorated soldiers.

75
00:04:28,966 --> 00:04:33,737
He's a hero, and now our
country's most secret weapon.

76
00:04:33,739 --> 00:04:36,573
Gabriel possesses
a rare genetic mutation

77
00:04:36,575 --> 00:04:39,476
that allowed us to implant
a microchip in his brain.

78
00:04:39,478 --> 00:04:43,079
We connected his mind directly
to the information grid.

79
00:04:43,081 --> 00:04:45,415
It's something the chip does
that nobody expected.

80
00:04:45,417 --> 00:04:48,485
I can create a virtual snapshot
of an event in my mind

81
00:04:48,487 --> 00:04:49,552
and then walk through it.

82
00:04:49,554 --> 00:04:51,254
It's like
a virtual evidence wall.

83
00:04:51,256 --> 00:04:52,522
At U.S. Cyber Command,

84
00:04:52,524 --> 00:04:55,558
we created a highly
specialized unit around him...

85
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:56,726
Amos:
Satellite in five.

86
00:04:56,728 --> 00:04:59,596
And assigned
an agent to protect him.

87
00:04:59,598 --> 00:05:00,997
Run!

88
00:05:00,999 --> 00:05:03,266
He's the first of his kind...

89
00:05:03,268 --> 00:05:06,669

of intelligence.

soldier like Norris,

92
00:05:28,329 --> 00:05:30,663
that kind of résumé,

93
00:05:30,665 --> 00:05:34,433
become a hired mercenary for a
crazed despot in South America?

94

Combat's addictive.
No other rush like it.

00:05:38,573 --> 00:05:39,672

the battlefield.

97

But to become an assassin?

98
00:05:46,547 --> 00:05:49,515
Were there any warning signs
with Norris?

99
00:05:49,517 --> 00:05:53,519
Psychological spikes,
morally questionable behavior?

Yeah. [Sighs]

I counted 15 of them.

116
00:06:36,997 --> 00:06:39,931
[Groans] I'm out.

117
00:06:39,933 --> 00:06:41,967
I got, uh, five rounds.

I'll dig in here.

Ah, funny guy.

You never were that good
at math, Norris.

121
00:06:48,041 --> 00:06:49,374
Even if you hit them
with all 5 rounds,

122
00:06:49,376 --> 00:06:50,709
that still leaves 10 of them
to kill us.

123
00:06:50,711 --> 00:06:54,145
Oh, they won't kill us.
They'll torture us.

I'm gonna draw them off.

for you.

What happened between you two?

148

He used to say
I was his conscience.

That doesn't sound so bad.

150
00:08:12,558 --> 00:08:14,925
He didn't want a conscience.

151
00:08:16,561 --> 00:08:19,063
So, going up against him...

152
00:08:19,065 --> 00:08:21,732

I'm Javier León.

This is my wife, Marcela.

This is Agent Jameson.

160

Agent Neal's keeping
an eye outside.

161
00:09:14,553 --> 00:09:15,986
It's a pleasure to meet you.

162
00:09:15,988 --> 00:09:17,621
The pleasure's ours, sir.

163
00:09:17,623 --> 00:09:18,989
So, how does this work?

164
00:09:18,991 --> 00:09:20,791
I'll bring you
to a secure safe house,

165
00:09:20,793 --> 00:09:22,192
and you'll remain with me there

166
00:09:22,194 --> 00:09:24,928
until the undersecretary and his
team have arrived in country.

167
00:09:24,930 --> 00:09:27,531
Agent Jameson will then take you
to the location of the meeting.

168
00:09:27,533 --> 00:09:29,266
And where will that be?

169
00:09:29,268 --> 00:09:31,234
It's better
if we don't tell you that yet.

170
00:09:31,236 --> 00:09:34,171
At this point,
any information is need-to-know.

171

You don't trust me,
señor Vaughn?

172
00:09:36,308 --> 00:09:38,208
Respectfully, sir,
we don't know your team.

This is my wife's brother,

He's the primary reason
we're still alive.

175

- You follow LA Paz football?
- A little bit.

- Gabriel.
- Mucho gusto.

00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:58,695
And what will you be doing,
Agent Vaughn,

179
00:09:58,697 --> 00:10:01,865
while Señor Jameson is
keeping us so safe?

180
00:10:01,867 --> 00:10:03,566
I'm gonna find the man
who wants you dead.

181
00:10:03,568 --> 00:10:06,836
No matter how I feel about
the men who have been killed,

182
00:10:06,838 --> 00:10:10,039
assassination is the lowest form
of political protest.

183
00:10:10,041 --> 00:10:11,875
When you find those
who are responsible

184
00:10:11,877 --> 00:10:16,546
for the murder of my opponents,
please bring them to justice.

185
00:10:16,548 --> 00:10:18,081
We'll do our best, sir.

186
00:10:22,961 --> 00:10:24,921
The package is safe
and on its way to the kitchen.

187
00:10:24,923 --> 00:10:27,023
<i>And you're certain nobody</i>
<i>was following you?</i>

188
00:10:27,025 --> 00:10:29,525
As certain as I can be,
given we didn't set up the meet.

189
00:10:29,527 --> 00:10:31,361
Is your guy Cogan reliable?

190
00:10:31,363 --> 00:10:33,129
Of course.

191
00:10:33,131 --> 00:10:36,566
<i>He's also our only covert asset</i>
<i>in the country.</i>

192
00:10:36,568 --> 00:10:39,502
<i>If anyone would have the intel on
Norris, it would be Agent Cogan.</i>

193
00:10:39,504 --> 00:10:41,370
Well, we're about to meet him.

194
00:10:41,372 --> 00:10:43,439
Nice digs.

195
00:10:43,441 --> 00:10:45,808
When you guys say “clandestine”"
you really mean it.

196
00:10:45,810 --> 00:10:48,878
<i>Talk to you crazy kids later.</i>

197
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:51,881
I don't appreciate his manner.

198
00:10:51,883 --> 00:10:55,084
You'll get used to it.
Sort of.

199
00:11:04,761 --> 00:11:06,595
You sightseeing?

200
00:11:06,597 --> 00:11:10,399
It's a secret service tick.

201
00:11:10,401 --> 00:11:12,902
I don't like going into places
where the only exit I know of

202
00:11:12,904 --> 00:11:14,570
is the door we're walking in.

203
00:11:14,572 --> 00:11:17,206
Relax. Uncle Sam pays the rent.
It's all wired.

204
00:11:17,208 --> 00:11:19,208
There's a security camera
above that door.

205
00:11:19,210 --> 00:11:21,844
I'm looking back at us
right now. Say “cheese”"

206
00:11:21,846 --> 00:11:25,047
let's go.

207
00:11:32,155 --> 00:11:34,456
Something's wrong.
Get behind me.

208
00:11:34,458 --> 00:11:35,891
<i>You</i> get behind me.

209
00:11:35,893 --> 00:11:37,526
Riley.
Gabriel.

210
00:11:37,528 --> 00:11:40,662
Together, then.
One, two...

211
00:11:40,664 --> 00:11:43,365
Three.

212
00:11:43,367 --> 00:11:46,401
- Is that Cogan?
- It's him.

213
00:11:49,506 --> 00:11:52,107
Norris!

214
00:11:52,109 --> 00:11:55,410
Norris!

215
00:11:57,981 --> 00:11:59,915
Norris is in the back
of the house.

216
00:11:59,917 --> 00:12:01,516
[High-pitched whirring]
Gabriel!

217
00:12:01,518 --> 00:12:02,684
You tripped something.

218
00:12:02,686 --> 00:12:04,720
[Rapid beeping] Run!

219
00:12:11,094 --> 00:12:13,095
[Groans] [Coughing]

220
00:12:13,097 --> 00:12:15,363
[Groans]

221
00:12:15,365 --> 00:12:17,799
Are you okay?

222
00:12:17,801 --> 00:12:19,735
Ugh. I think so.

223
00:12:19,737 --> 00:12:22,137
Are you?

224
00:12:22,139 --> 00:12:24,639
[Both groan]

225
00:12:24,641 --> 00:12:27,843
That was close.

226
00:12:32,582 --> 00:12:34,583
[Sighs]

227
00:12:34,585 --> 00:12:36,184
He's gone.

228
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:40,522
We lost him.

229
00:12:45,538 --> 00:12:46,704
[Breathing heavily]

230
00:12:46,706 --> 00:12:48,573
[Dog barking in distance]

231
00:12:48,575 --> 00:12:50,541
So, what's our theory on this?

232
00:12:50,543 --> 00:12:52,844
Norris found out
the CIA was tracking him,

233
00:12:52,846 --> 00:12:53,945
so he killed Cogan.

234
00:12:53,947 --> 00:12:55,546
And booby-traps the apartment
to take out

235
00:12:55,548 --> 00:12:57,048
any other spook
who shows up there.

236
00:12:57,050 --> 00:12:59,017
Now that he's seen me,
it just got personal.

237
00:12:59,019 --> 00:13:01,219
And for you, is it personal?

238
00:13:01,221 --> 00:13:02,920
No.

239
00:13:02,922 --> 00:13:06,224
He's just a guy we have to
bring down, nothing more.

240
00:13:06,226 --> 00:13:07,992
Who are you calling?

241
00:13:07,994 --> 00:13:10,628
C-doc. We have to tell them
Norris killed Cogan.

242
00:13:10,630 --> 00:13:11,963
I have a better idea.

243
00:13:13,165 --> 00:13:14,832
Let's call Norris.

244
00:13:14,834 --> 00:13:16,767
How do you plan on doing that?

245
00:13:16,769 --> 00:13:18,002
He's got a cellphone on him.

246
00:13:18,004 --> 00:13:19,437
I caught the digits
right before the room blew.

247
00:13:19,439 --> 00:13:20,605
Can you use it to track him?

248
00:13:20,607 --> 00:13:23,007
He's too smart
to use a next-gen phone.

249
00:13:23,009 --> 00:13:24,175
What do you mean?

250
00:13:24,177 --> 00:13:26,510
The older ones don't have GPS...
harder to track.

251
00:13:26,512 --> 00:13:28,613
We'd have to triangulate
off three towers.

252
00:13:28,615 --> 00:13:30,314
And we're in Bolivia.
We're lucky we have one.

253
00:13:30,316 --> 00:13:32,416
[Sighs]
So you're just gonna call him?

254
00:13:32,418 --> 00:13:34,285
Why not?

255
00:13:34,287 --> 00:13:37,455
[Cellphone ringing]

256
00:13:37,457 --> 00:13:40,357
Yeah?

257
00:13:40,359 --> 00:13:44,261
Gabriel: Where are
you running to, Johnny?

258
00:13:44,263 --> 00:13:47,298
Believe me,
I'm as surprised as you are.

259

[Indistinct conversations]

260
00:13:49,836 --> 00:13:51,402
The hell are you doing here?

261
00:13:51,404 --> 00:13:52,770
I came to see you.

262
00:13:52,772 --> 00:13:56,874
So what's your game, brah?
Who are you working for?

263
00:13:56,876 --> 00:14:00,210
I was gonna ask you
the same question.

264
00:14:00,212 --> 00:14:02,313
We need to meet.
I want to talk.

265
00:14:02,315 --> 00:14:05,883
No, we don't need to talk.
You need to step off.

266
00:14:05,885 --> 00:14:07,551
Or what, Johnny?

267
00:14:07,553 --> 00:14:10,320
You know better
than to ask me that.

268
00:14:10,322 --> 00:14:11,922
[Cellphone beeps]

269
00:14:14,225 --> 00:14:15,926
[Cellphone clatters]

270
00:14:15,928 --> 00:14:18,595
Did he threaten you?
[Siren wails]

271
00:14:18,597 --> 00:14:20,931
It's just the way
he says hello.

272
00:14:20,933 --> 00:14:22,766
[Rapid footsteps]

Don't shoot, bro.

[Grunting]

277

Aah!

278
00:14:52,396 --> 00:14:55,298
You said this place was clear.
It is.

279
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:56,600

Come on. Come on. Get up.

280

282
00:15:05,510 --> 00:15:07,711
Relax.
I got it covered.

Shut up.

It's okay.

Shh. Shh.
Great scream.

294
00:15:39,711 --> 00:15:41,631
Why don't you set off a flare
while you're at it?

295
00:15:42,947 --> 00:15:44,213
Where's the father?

296
00:15:44,215 --> 00:15:45,882
Wasn't here.

297
00:15:45,884 --> 00:15:48,165
He's probably one of the guys
out there trying to kill us.

298
00:15:57,227 --> 00:15:59,595
No. We're not animals.

No, we couldn't have, Lillian.

Not out here,
not without a satellite.

307
00:16:18,650 --> 00:16:19,815
Why don't we have a satellite?

308
00:16:19,817 --> 00:16:21,684
The closest one is over Mexico.

309
00:16:21,686 --> 00:16:23,653
It'll take hours to get it
in place.

310
00:16:23,655 --> 00:16:25,654
<i>Look, I know this man.</i>
<i>We bled together.</i>

<i>I didn't send you there</i>
<i>to talk him down.</i>

<i>to take him out.</i>

So, what?
I'm an assassin now?

and I kill a man?

Yes, as a matter of fact.

I press a button
and you kill a man.

318
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:37,867
That's how it works.
Are we clear?

319
00:16:39,269 --> 00:16:41,637
Yeah, we're clear.

320
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:47,176
You and I might
become friends after all.

321
00:16:47,178 --> 00:16:49,845
Unlikely.

322
00:16:56,019 --> 00:16:58,921

were more like that.

Straight to the books, no matter
how awful the situation.

325
00:17:03,894 --> 00:17:06,128
And what is so awful?

326
00:17:06,130 --> 00:17:10,332
That we have to be in a place
like this, hiding like cowards.

327
00:17:10,334 --> 00:17:14,369
When Cleopatra was at war
with her brother

328
00:17:14,371 --> 00:17:16,004
for the throne of Alexandria,

329
00:17:16,006 --> 00:17:19,107
there was one prize
that she needed first.

330
00:17:19,109 --> 00:17:21,076
Caesar.

331
00:17:21,078 --> 00:17:23,412
If she could seduce Caesar...

332
00:17:23,414 --> 00:17:26,148
Mm... She'd have a
titan for an ally.

333
00:17:26,150 --> 00:17:30,085
And are you prepared to lift
your dress for America?

Jameson:
Okay, your men are outside.

335
00:17:31,689 --> 00:17:33,822
Nestor will remain
in the house with us.

336
00:17:33,824 --> 00:17:35,757
What do you have there?

337
00:17:35,759 --> 00:17:38,593
It's a blueprint. There's
a control room downstairs.

338
00:17:43,566 --> 00:17:48,904
The Bolivians officially
ejected the U.S. in '84.

339
00:17:48,906 --> 00:17:50,338
The CIA needed to protect

340
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:52,440
their people who were still
in the country,

341
00:17:52,442 --> 00:17:54,209
so they built
these safe houses.

342
00:17:58,014 --> 00:18:01,449
[Chuckles]
Technology's a little outdated.

343
00:18:01,451 --> 00:18:03,952
It should still work.

344
00:18:05,621 --> 00:18:08,089
Now we have eyes.

345
00:18:08,091 --> 00:18:11,059
What about communication?

346
00:18:11,061 --> 00:18:14,729
Well, there's no cell tower
in the area.

347
00:18:14,731 --> 00:18:16,598
Fortunately,
we brought our own.

348
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:18,099
A mobile satellite terminal.

349
00:18:18,101 --> 00:18:19,467
With this puppy,
we'll be able to remain

350
00:18:19,469 --> 00:18:21,970
in direct communication
with our team at all times.

351
00:18:21,972 --> 00:18:23,972
Okay, you two should
get some rest.

352
00:18:23,974 --> 00:18:25,907
The undersecretary will be here
in the morning.

353
00:18:25,909 --> 00:18:27,775
Here?

All we have to do
is survive, bro.

Why didn't you let me bite it
out there?

538
00:30:32,494 --> 00:30:34,494
'Cause I'm not an assassin.

539
00:30:34,496 --> 00:30:37,164
What do you call
what you did to Cogan?

540
00:30:37,166 --> 00:30:39,633
What are you talking about?
I never met Cogan.

541
00:30:39,635 --> 00:30:42,135
That's 'cause you killed him first.
What are you trying to pull?

542
00:30:42,137 --> 00:30:43,270
You killed Cogan.
We both know it.

543
00:30:43,272 --> 00:30:45,539
And why would I kill Cogan?

544
00:30:45,541 --> 00:30:47,440
Same reason you killed
the other three Bolivians.

545
00:30:47,442 --> 00:30:49,075
Cut the crap, Norris.
I saw you there.

546
00:30:49,077 --> 00:30:51,278
I showed up to check in.

547
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:54,547
10 seconds later, the place blew up.
Check in?

548
00:30:54,549 --> 00:30:56,182
I worked for Cogan.

549

You saying
you work for the CIA?

550

Red op.

551
00:31:02,390 --> 00:31:03,890
Only Cogan knew.

552
00:31:03,892 --> 00:31:05,959
Convenient.

553
00:31:05,961 --> 00:31:08,128
Uh, not really.

554
00:31:08,130 --> 00:31:10,230
You assassinated
the other three rebel leaders.

555
00:31:10,232 --> 00:31:11,297
Explain that.

the knuckle-dragging brother.

I've been in worse spots.

I'm glad I wasn't there
for those.

580
00:32:36,617 --> 00:32:38,083
We're gonna get you out
with the undersecretary.

Are you okay?
I know you will.

I'll be glad when he's here.

583
00:32:42,623 --> 00:32:45,324
He'll have diplomatic security
with them.

584

Any word from Gabriel yet?

585
00:32:47,161 --> 00:32:50,963
Nothing.

586

I know staying back with me
and letting Gabriel

587
00:32:54,869 --> 00:32:57,402
go off alone,
that had to be tough for you.

588
00:32:59,172 --> 00:33:00,639
No.

589
00:33:00,641 --> 00:33:03,942
No, it was the right call.

Sometimes he acts before
he thinks, and I just hope...

592
00:33:08,349 --> 00:33:11,350
you're worried about him.

I'm worried, too.

You're telling me Marcela's
gonna kill her own husband?

596
00:33:19,660 --> 00:33:22,728
She worked for the government.
For El Presidente.

597
00:33:22,730 --> 00:33:25,063
Oh, Javier doesn't have a clue.

598
00:33:25,065 --> 00:33:26,731
Carrizales ordered them
to kill him.

599
00:33:26,733 --> 00:33:27,899
Why?

600
00:33:27,901 --> 00:33:30,435
'Cause he decided
to deal with the U.S.

601
00:33:30,437 --> 00:33:32,237
It's a red line
for Carrizales' people.

602
00:33:32,239 --> 00:33:34,806
So I got the order to...

603
00:33:34,808 --> 00:33:36,808
Make sure Javier was protected
and the last one standing.

604
00:33:36,810 --> 00:33:40,178
And when we realized Marcela
and Bro-zilla were dirty,

the gun already?

why isn't León dead yet?

This whole thing is about the
meeting with the undersecretary.

she's dead, too.

[Sighs]

718

a lot of things, Jeff.

720

[Chuckles]
Really? You think so?

726
00:41:29,612 --> 00:41:32,746
I think I got it from here.

And this is your last beer.

Not really.

00:42:26,567 --> 00:42:28,268
