1
00:01:00,352 --> 00:01:02,812
Is it a girl?
Yes.

2
00:01:02,896 --> 00:01:04,605
Show me its arm.

3
00:01:04,690 --> 00:01:07,442
She bears the mark.
No!

4
00:01:10,237 --> 00:01:13,781
The omen is true.
I must tell my mother.

5
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:18,286
Help me! I can't.

6
00:01:18,370 --> 00:01:21,164
They're going to kill her.

7
00:01:25,043 --> 00:01:29,005
Please! Please!

8
00:01:29,089 --> 00:01:33,634
Oh, thank you, Ethna. Thank you.

9
00:01:42,186 --> 00:01:44,687
Stand aside for Queen Bavmorda!

10
00:02:09,087 --> 00:02:11,547
You cannot stop the prophecy!

11
00:02:11,632 --> 00:02:14,550
This child will have no power over me.
Start the ritual.

12
00:02:14,635 --> 00:02:19,430
- No. No!
- Where's the baby?

13
00:02:19,556 --> 00:02:21,974
The midwife.
Find that baby, Sorsha.

14
00:02:22,059 --> 00:02:25,436
Use the dogs. Bring her back to me alive!

15
00:02:25,521 --> 00:02:27,647
Your reign of terror is at an end!

16
00:02:27,731 --> 00:02:29,816
She will come back,
and she will finish you!

17
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:33,444
- Silence, wench.
- My baby will finish you! - Kill her.

18
00:06:00,777 --> 00:06:02,778
Dada! Dada!

19
00:06:06,158 --> 00:06:09,452
Dada! Dada!
Whoa! Whoa!

20
00:06:10,579 --> 00:06:13,956
Dada! Dada!
We found something in the river.

21
00:06:14,041 --> 00:06:15,958
I can't run off and play
with you now, Ranon.

22
00:06:16,043 --> 00:06:18,294
- I've got work to do.
- You gotta come. Hurry!

23
00:06:23,341 --> 00:06:25,801
Come on.

24
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:31,265
Don't go near it.
We don't know where it's been.

25
00:06:31,349 --> 00:06:34,185
But, Dada, it's a baby.

26
00:06:34,311 --> 00:06:39,106
It's not like us.
No. It's not a Nelwyn.

27
00:06:39,191 --> 00:06:42,735
- It looks like a Daikini baby.
- What's a Daikini?

28
00:06:42,819 --> 00:06:45,154
Daikinis are big.

29
00:06:45,238 --> 00:06:48,365
Giants who live far away.

30
00:06:48,450 --> 00:06:50,659
Oh, she's so cute.

31
00:06:50,786 --> 00:06:53,829
Can't we keep it, Dada?
No!

32
00:06:55,207 --> 00:07:00,127
We'll push it downstream and forget
we ever saw it. Come on.

33
00:07:00,212 --> 00:07:02,129
Ufgood! Willow Ufgood!

34
00:07:02,214 --> 00:07:06,425
Shhh! It's the prefect. That's all I need.

35
00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:09,845
Keep it quiet. Don't touch it.

36
00:07:11,515 --> 00:07:15,267
Mr. Burglekutt,
my husband hasn't stolen anything!

37
00:07:15,352 --> 00:07:17,311
Baaa!

38
00:07:20,774 --> 00:07:24,276
Ufgood, you still haven't
paid your debts to me.

39
00:07:24,361 --> 00:07:26,362
Where did you get these seeds?

40
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:29,156
Well, maybe I used magic.

41
00:07:29,241 --> 00:07:33,202
You're no sorcerer, Ufgood.
You're a clown.

42
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:36,831
I sell the planting seeds around here.
Now tell me where you got them.

43
00:07:36,915 --> 00:07:40,376
My family's been gathering them
in the forest since last fall.

44
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:43,462
There's no law against that.

45
00:07:43,547 --> 00:07:47,007
Willow, you didn't leave them
alone by the river?

46
00:07:48,802 --> 00:07:51,137
Magic? You'll need magic...

47
00:07:51,221 --> 00:07:53,514
if you expect to get your planting
done before the rains start.

48
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,518
I will have this land, Ufgood.

49
00:07:57,602 --> 00:08:01,147
And you're gonna end up
working in the mines.

50
00:08:10,198 --> 00:08:13,200
Oh, you're lovely.

51
00:08:13,285 --> 00:08:15,286
Yes, you are.

52
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:16,912
Kiaya!

53
00:08:16,997 --> 00:08:19,748
Oh, Willow!

54
00:08:19,875 --> 00:08:24,837
Good girl. Good girl.
Under no condition whatsoever...

55
00:08:24,921 --> 00:08:27,590
is anyone in this family
to fall in love with that baby.

56
00:08:27,674 --> 00:08:32,386
Yes, you are. Come on, Mims.
Come on. Come on.

57
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:34,513
There we are. Come on.

58
00:08:34,598 --> 00:08:37,224
Hey, I will not be ignored!

59
00:08:37,309 --> 00:08:41,020
Mims? Ranon?

60
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:54,116
You're gonna be all clean.

61
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:04,084
Willow, do you think we should
take her to the village council?

62
00:09:04,169 --> 00:09:06,754
No. No. They'll think it's a bad omen.

63
00:09:06,838 --> 00:09:09,715
There'll be a flood or a drought,
and everyone will blame me for it.

64
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:12,635
"Willow Ufgood brought around
that Daikini, didn't he?"

65
00:09:12,719 --> 00:09:15,721
"That's right. And he's that
lousy farmer too. Let's get him!"

66
00:09:15,805 --> 00:09:19,892
- Willow, calm down.
- Calm down?

67
00:09:19,976 --> 00:09:22,019
Kiaya, tomorrow's my big day.

68
00:09:22,103 --> 00:09:25,814
Love, the High Aldwin hasn't
picked a new apprentice in years.

69
00:09:25,899 --> 00:09:29,151
Tomorrow's gonna be different.
I just know he's gonna pick me.

70
00:09:31,947 --> 00:09:35,532
Here. Hold her.
Hey, no. I don't want her, Kiaya.

71
00:09:35,659 --> 00:09:38,452
Hold her while I get some milk.
Oh, no, no. Oh.

72
00:09:46,086 --> 00:09:49,505
Dada, she likes you.

73
00:09:57,973 --> 00:09:59,473
Bye.

74
00:10:01,017 --> 00:10:04,853
Come on, kids. Let's go.

75
00:10:08,525 --> 00:10:10,776
#

76
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:14,488
I will now magically join the rings!

77
00:10:15,991 --> 00:10:18,826
#

78
00:10:36,428 --> 00:10:39,054
Whoa-ah!

79
00:10:43,893 --> 00:10:46,228
Thank you, son.

80
00:10:46,313 --> 00:10:51,275
If you're easily shocked,
please turn away.

81
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:58,073
#

82
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:08,751
Give me a ripe one. Good.

83
00:11:15,008 --> 00:11:19,470
And now, for my final amazing feat,

84
00:11:19,596 --> 00:11:24,433
I will make this entire pig disappear!

85
00:11:32,484 --> 00:11:37,571
- Mims, see?
- Please, watch very closely.

86
00:11:37,697 --> 00:11:43,285
Wuppity bairn, deru, deru!

87
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:47,956
Well-
What happened to your pig?

88
00:11:50,668 --> 00:11:53,670
No! Hey, come here, you!

89
00:11:58,176 --> 00:12:01,512
I seen enough.

90
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:07,142
#

91
00:12:16,694 --> 00:12:19,905
Attention! The High Aldwin...

92
00:12:20,031 --> 00:12:22,950
will now make his choice for his new apprentice!
You'll be all right.

93
00:12:23,034 --> 00:12:26,495
Bring forth the hopefuls.

94
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:28,956
Good luck.
Good luck, Dada.

95
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:32,793
Willow Ufgood, a hopeful?
How did he get picked?

96
00:12:32,877 --> 00:12:35,379
Is this a joke?

97
00:12:35,463 --> 00:12:39,925
Willow?

98
00:12:42,262 --> 00:12:47,808
Magic is the bloodstream of the universe!

99
00:12:47,892 --> 00:12:52,438
Forget all you know... or think you know.

100
00:12:52,522 --> 00:12:56,525
All that you require is your intuition.

101
00:12:56,609 --> 00:13:00,779
Now, the power to control the world...

102
00:13:00,864 --> 00:13:04,116
is in which finger?

103
00:13:47,285 --> 00:13:51,830
No apprentice this year!

104
00:13:51,915 --> 00:13:54,708
#

105
00:14:12,227 --> 00:14:15,604
- Where's Mims?
- I don't know. She was right here!

106
00:14:15,688 --> 00:14:18,565
Take Ranon in there, quick!

107
00:14:26,491 --> 00:14:29,451
Mims!

108
00:14:30,787 --> 00:14:32,955
Mims!

109
00:14:41,214 --> 00:14:45,968
- Mims!
- Dada...

110
00:14:47,303 --> 00:14:50,305
I'm scared, Dada!

111
00:15:00,650 --> 00:15:03,235
Come on!

112
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:23,880
Vohnkar!

113
00:15:33,391 --> 00:15:36,310
Check to make sure it's not still alive.
It's dead!

114
00:15:38,646 --> 00:15:40,355
Dada! Dada!

115
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:46,028
It was looking for somebody's baby!

116
00:15:49,073 --> 00:15:52,826
- Mommy.
- Kiaya!

117
00:16:00,251 --> 00:16:03,587
Kiaya! Kiaya!

118
00:16:03,671 --> 00:16:06,673
I'm here.

119
00:16:10,762 --> 00:16:14,389
Oh, Kiaya.

120
00:16:14,474 --> 00:16:16,642
We can't keep the baby, Kiaya.

121
00:16:16,726 --> 00:16:19,561
We have to take her
to the village council.

122
00:16:33,076 --> 00:16:37,996
Silence! One beast we can kill,
but there may be more.

123
00:16:38,081 --> 00:16:40,499
And you can be assured
that they won't give up...

124
00:16:40,583 --> 00:16:42,459
until they find what they're looking for!

125
00:16:42,585 --> 00:16:45,837
It's a sign!
Who's to blame for this?

126
00:16:45,922 --> 00:16:48,382
We must find the culprit
and throw him in the pit!

127
00:16:48,466 --> 00:16:53,595
In the pit! In the pit!

128
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:55,806
In the pit! In the pit!

129
00:16:55,890 --> 00:16:59,184
In the pit! In the pit!
Willow.

130
00:16:59,268 --> 00:17:03,605
Willow Ufgood.

131
00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:06,149
Come forward.

132
00:17:11,781 --> 00:17:17,077
My children found this baby
alone by the river, High Aldwin.

133
00:17:22,792 --> 00:17:24,918
A Daikini child.

134
00:17:25,002 --> 00:17:28,213
That's what the beasts want.
Let's give it back to them!

135
00:17:28,297 --> 00:17:29,381
Yeah!

136
00:17:29,465 --> 00:17:32,718
- They'll kill her! You can't!
- It isn't one of us.

137
00:17:32,802 --> 00:17:35,470
This child is special!

138
00:17:35,555 --> 00:17:39,850
This child must be taken beyond
the boundaries of our village.

139
00:17:39,934 --> 00:17:42,978
All the way across the great river...

140
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:45,147
to the Daikini crossroads.

141
00:17:45,231 --> 00:17:49,943
- Well, who'll do that?
- It seems only fair...

142
00:17:50,027 --> 00:17:53,405
that the man to take
this baby to the crossroads...

143
00:17:53,489 --> 00:17:56,324
be the very man who
plucked it out of the river.

144
00:17:57,994 --> 00:18:00,579
I nominate Willow Ufgood.

145
00:18:00,663 --> 00:18:03,248
No!

146
00:18:03,332 --> 00:18:06,793
I will consult the bones!

147
00:18:14,719 --> 00:18:19,723
The bones tell me... nothing.

148
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:25,228
Do you have any love for this child?

149
00:18:33,696 --> 00:18:38,158
Yes. Yes, I do.

150
00:18:38,284 --> 00:18:42,662
The bones have spoken!

151
00:18:42,747 --> 00:18:46,708
Willow Ufgood, the safety
of this village depends upon you.

152
00:18:46,793 --> 00:18:50,879
- Praise the bones!
- Praise the bones!

153
00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:53,465
But you will need help.

154
00:18:53,549 --> 00:18:58,845
Who has the courage to protect
our brave fellow on his journey?

155
00:19:00,932 --> 00:19:05,018
- I'll go with him.
- Ah, Meegosh.

156
00:19:05,102 --> 00:19:08,396
- Excellent choice.
- I'll go!

157
00:19:08,481 --> 00:19:10,941
Vohnkar! Vohnkar!

158
00:19:11,025 --> 00:19:13,693
No! Not Vohnkar!
He's the best warrior in the village!

159
00:19:13,778 --> 00:19:16,905
We need him here! Vohnkar, step back!

160
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:27,582
All this expedition needs is a leader.

161
00:19:27,667 --> 00:19:31,044
And according to the bones,

162
00:19:31,128 --> 00:19:34,089
that leader is...

163
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:37,008
you, Burglekutt!

164
00:19:37,093 --> 00:19:39,719
Vohnkar!

165
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:44,766
What's your problem, son?
How do you mean?

166
00:19:45,476 --> 00:19:50,146
When I held up my fingers,
what was your first impulse?

167
00:19:50,273 --> 00:19:54,067
Well, it was stupid.
Just tell me.

168
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:58,655
To pick my own finger.
Aha! That was the correct answer.

169
00:19:58,739 --> 00:20:03,451
You lack faith in yourself.
More than anyone in the village,

170
00:20:03,536 --> 00:20:06,162
you have the potential
to be a great sorcerer.

171
00:20:06,247 --> 00:20:11,001
Now, when you're out there,
listen to your own heart.

172
00:20:12,795 --> 00:20:15,380
These will protect you.

173
00:20:15,506 --> 00:20:18,049
Acorns?
They're magic!

174
00:20:18,134 --> 00:20:22,095
Anything you throw them at
turns to stone.

175
00:20:25,182 --> 00:20:28,435
You have much to learn, young Ufgood.

176
00:20:41,365 --> 00:20:45,827
- Are you scared, Dada?
- No!

177
00:20:45,912 --> 00:20:47,996
Even with fairies in the woods...

178
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,123
that'll put you to sleep
for a hundred years?

179
00:20:51,667 --> 00:20:54,252
Doesn't bother me.
Brownies?

180
00:20:54,337 --> 00:20:57,255
- Dragons?
- Trolls?

181
00:20:57,340 --> 00:21:00,800
Trolls that'll skin you alive
and take your face off?

182
00:21:00,885 --> 00:21:04,471
Ranon! You know I hate trolls.

183
00:21:04,555 --> 00:21:07,682
I can be your guard and carry your spear.

184
00:21:07,767 --> 00:21:09,392
Me too. Me too, Dada.

185
00:21:10,937 --> 00:21:16,191
What a lucky father I am.
I wish I could take you bobbins with me.

186
00:21:19,362 --> 00:21:21,905
Good-bye, Dada.

187
00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:26,284
Go play! Go on.

188
00:21:31,916 --> 00:21:34,668
We've never been apart.

189
00:21:37,463 --> 00:21:39,756
I miss you already.

190
00:21:40,883 --> 00:21:44,636
Don't worry, Kiaya. I'll be fine.

191
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,554
I'll be back before you know it.

192
00:21:48,891 --> 00:21:51,559
Well, remember to keep her warm.

193
00:21:53,604 --> 00:21:56,272
And... here.

194
00:21:58,484 --> 00:22:01,277
This will bring you luck.

195
00:22:14,458 --> 00:22:16,751
Good brave people!

196
00:22:18,629 --> 00:22:21,339
The outer world is no place for a Nelwyn.

197
00:22:21,424 --> 00:22:24,092
Give the baby
to the first Daikini you see,

198
00:22:24,176 --> 00:22:26,344
then hurry home.

199
00:22:29,682 --> 00:22:33,268
Tuatha... lokwathrak... tuatha!

200
00:22:33,352 --> 00:22:36,896
Go in the direction the bird is flying!

201
00:22:40,943 --> 00:22:43,778
It's going back to the village!

202
00:22:45,614 --> 00:22:47,615
Ignore the bird. Follow the river.

203
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:49,951
Move out!

204
00:23:13,893 --> 00:23:17,395
Hold on, Meegosh.
What's wrong?

205
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:21,441
- We have to stop.
- Stop? Why?

206
00:23:21,525 --> 00:23:23,943
The baby's sick.

207
00:23:27,990 --> 00:23:31,117
She's not sick! Let me see.

208
00:23:32,661 --> 00:23:35,789
Uhaghh! Take her! Take her!

209
00:23:38,459 --> 00:23:41,503
She'll be fine once she gets some rest.

210
00:23:43,881 --> 00:23:45,465
Clean me up.

211
00:23:49,178 --> 00:23:52,388
I didn't ask you
to bring me a dead nursemaid.

212
00:23:52,515 --> 00:23:56,434
Sorsha, you're useless!
I'm backtracking the nursemaid's trail.

213
00:23:56,519 --> 00:23:58,686
I'll find where she hid the baby.

214
00:24:00,648 --> 00:24:02,899
Ah, General Kael, at last.

215
00:24:02,983 --> 00:24:07,695
My queen, I have destroyed
the castle at Galladoorn.

216
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:11,449
Well done. But now I have
another task for you.

217
00:24:11,534 --> 00:24:16,996
Help my daughter to find
that tiny, helpless baby...

218
00:24:17,081 --> 00:24:19,040
that continues somehow to elude her.

219
00:24:21,043 --> 00:24:22,961
The baby of the prophecy?

220
00:24:23,045 --> 00:24:26,464
- The one that would destroy you?
- I need that baby alive.

221
00:24:26,549 --> 00:24:32,470
I must perform the ritual that will exile
the child's spirit into oblivion.

222
00:24:32,555 --> 00:24:35,223
- Find her!
- I don't need his help, Mother.

223
00:24:35,307 --> 00:24:37,350
You'll do as I say, child.

224
00:24:43,816 --> 00:24:45,984
I read the signs.

225
00:24:46,068 --> 00:24:49,237
One day, I fear,
your daughter will betray you.

226
00:24:49,321 --> 00:24:53,491
I trust her loyalty
more than I trust yours.

227
00:25:09,216 --> 00:25:11,759
Move!

228
00:25:11,844 --> 00:25:13,761
Into the bush. Come on. Move!

229
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:21,811
Come on!

230
00:25:31,447 --> 00:25:34,365
The Nelwyns have got the baby.
We've searched the village.

231
00:25:34,450 --> 00:25:37,368
But a group of them
are on the road somewhere.

232
00:25:37,453 --> 00:25:39,245
They couldn't have gone far!

233
00:25:39,330 --> 00:25:42,290
Widen the search and report to Sorsha!

234
00:25:49,131 --> 00:25:51,424
Come. We'll keep to the woods.

235
00:26:31,173 --> 00:26:35,385
That's it! It's the crossroads!

236
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:54,696
Keep this fire high.
We don't know what's out there.

237
00:27:00,369 --> 00:27:02,704
What was that?

238
00:27:04,123 --> 00:27:06,874
Get the spears!

239
00:27:23,392 --> 00:27:25,310
Uhh. Uhh.

240
00:27:25,394 --> 00:27:29,230
Give me some water, peck, or you die.

241
00:27:29,315 --> 00:27:31,733
Do you understand?

242
00:27:31,817 --> 00:27:33,693
Water.
Yeah.

243
00:27:35,904 --> 00:27:37,780
Hurry up!

244
00:27:41,869 --> 00:27:44,746
Get me some water,
you measly little pecks.

245
00:27:46,123 --> 00:27:48,291
It's a Daikini. We're in luck.

246
00:27:48,375 --> 00:27:50,793
We can't give her to him!

247
00:27:50,919 --> 00:27:54,839
Somebody put him there for a reason.
We've got to get rid of her.

248
00:27:54,923 --> 00:27:57,508
Those soldiers are after us.
Shhh.

249
00:27:57,593 --> 00:28:00,428
He's looking right at us.

250
00:28:04,433 --> 00:28:06,351
We've got to give that baby to somebody.

251
00:28:06,435 --> 00:28:09,270
I'm somebody.

252
00:28:09,355 --> 00:28:13,649
Let me out of here. I'll take care of the baby.

253
00:28:15,569 --> 00:28:20,156
I trust him completely.
But he tried to strangle me.

254
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:24,202
- I want to go home!
- No, Burglekutt!

255
00:28:24,286 --> 00:28:27,580
- We should wait!
- Are you challenging my authority?

256
00:28:27,664 --> 00:28:31,000
As far as this baby is concerned, yes.

257
00:28:31,085 --> 00:28:34,128
Don't listen to him, Burglekutt.

258
00:28:35,381 --> 00:28:39,300
Fine. You stay here alone,
but we're going.

259
00:28:39,385 --> 00:28:41,594
That's a bad idea. Very bad.

260
00:28:41,678 --> 00:28:45,056
- Dangerous out there.
- Get the gear, men.

261
00:28:45,182 --> 00:28:48,726
Vohnkar-
It's not his decision!

262
00:28:48,811 --> 00:28:52,730
Burglekutt, you're troll dung.

263
00:28:52,815 --> 00:28:54,482
Don't let him talk to you that way.

264
00:28:54,566 --> 00:28:56,651
Listen here, runt.

265
00:28:56,735 --> 00:29:00,696
While you're wasting time here,
your fields aren't getting planted.

266
00:29:00,823 --> 00:29:05,076
Think about it!
Burglekutt, I'm gonna...

267
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:08,538
You're gonna what?

268
00:29:12,501 --> 00:29:15,002
Someday, Burglekutt. Someday.

269
00:29:15,087 --> 00:29:17,046
Vohnkar, let's go!

270
00:29:20,843 --> 00:29:23,511
Meegosh, are you coming?

271
00:29:25,764 --> 00:29:29,350
- I'm staying.
- Come on, men.

272
00:29:29,435 --> 00:29:33,604
Burglekutt, let me out of here.
I'll take care of the baby. I swear.

273
00:29:33,689 --> 00:29:36,357
Just let me out of here. Please!

274
00:29:36,442 --> 00:29:39,944
Vohnkar, let me borrow that spear...
just for a minute.

275
00:29:40,028 --> 00:29:42,280
Well, at least get me some water!

276
00:29:42,364 --> 00:29:47,243
Burglekutt, don't leave me alone
with these two!

277
00:29:47,369 --> 00:29:52,123
What'll we do now, Willow?

278
00:29:52,207 --> 00:29:54,834
Well, that was really stupid, peck.

279
00:29:54,918 --> 00:29:59,714
- Don't call me a peck.
- Oh, I'm sorry... peck.

280
00:29:59,798 --> 00:30:03,551
- Peck, peck, peck, peck.
- You be careful!

281
00:30:03,635 --> 00:30:07,346
I'm a powerful sorcerer. See this acorn?

282
00:30:08,807 --> 00:30:13,311
- I'll throw it and turn you to stone.
- Whoo...

283
00:30:13,395 --> 00:30:15,354
I'm really scared.

284
00:30:15,439 --> 00:30:18,316
No, don't! Don't!

285
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:21,152
There's a peck here
with an acorn pointed at me!

286
00:30:21,236 --> 00:30:23,905
Oh, I wouldn't want to waste it.

287
00:30:23,989 --> 00:30:27,241
Ha! Peck, peck, peck, peck,

288
00:30:27,326 --> 00:30:29,869
peck, peck, peck, peck, peck!

289
00:30:58,482 --> 00:31:01,317
What was that?

290
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:08,449
Mornin', boys.

291
00:31:08,534 --> 00:31:12,662
Rough night last night, wasn't it?

292
00:31:12,746 --> 00:31:16,082
I don't think I introduced
myself yesterday.

293
00:31:16,166 --> 00:31:19,627
My name is Madmartigan,
and you are, uh...

294
00:31:19,711 --> 00:31:22,713
No, Meegosh. Don't go near him.

295
00:31:22,798 --> 00:31:26,133
- He's dangerous.
- I am not.

296
00:31:26,260 --> 00:31:28,344
Good.

297
00:31:33,141 --> 00:31:35,434
Stop! Wait!

298
00:31:37,187 --> 00:31:39,981
Whoa!

299
00:31:45,404 --> 00:31:48,948
- What's going on?
- Smells like a battle.

300
00:31:49,992 --> 00:31:52,535
I suppose you're a warrior.

301
00:31:52,619 --> 00:31:55,121
I am the greatest swordsman
that ever lived.

302
00:31:55,205 --> 00:31:57,999
Hmph.

303
00:31:58,083 --> 00:32:01,794
Say, uh-
Could I have some of that water?

304
00:32:11,555 --> 00:32:16,309
I don't know why I try.

305
00:32:21,106 --> 00:32:24,358
I guess I am gonna die here.
Who cares?

306
00:32:24,443 --> 00:32:26,319
Here.
Thanks, friend. Oh!

307
00:32:26,445 --> 00:32:28,821
What's that?

308
00:32:28,905 --> 00:32:32,867
I'd say two or three hundred horses,

309
00:32:32,951 --> 00:32:36,912
five or six wagons
and about a thousand fools.

310
00:32:39,666 --> 00:32:43,419
Thank you. Ohh-
Come on, Meegosh.

311
00:32:47,758 --> 00:32:51,510
It's gonna be all right, little bobbin.

312
00:32:57,434 --> 00:33:01,354
Everything's gonna be all right.

313
00:33:04,733 --> 00:33:07,735
- Excuse me, sir.
- Out of the way, peck!

314
00:33:09,780 --> 00:33:12,114
Uh, pardon me.

315
00:33:12,199 --> 00:33:14,283
Uh...

316
00:33:19,956 --> 00:33:25,169
Excuse me, sir. We found one
of your babies in our village.

317
00:33:25,253 --> 00:33:28,130
Will you please take care of her?

318
00:33:28,215 --> 00:33:32,593
We're going into battle, little ones.
Find a woman to take care of her.

319
00:33:34,096 --> 00:33:37,223
They thought you were a woman, Airk.

320
00:33:37,307 --> 00:33:39,684
Well...

321
00:33:39,768 --> 00:33:42,311
Madmartigan! What did you do this time?

322
00:33:42,396 --> 00:33:44,355
Nothing you wouldn't have done.

323
00:33:44,439 --> 00:33:46,774
I always knew
you'd end up in a crow's cage.

324
00:33:46,858 --> 00:33:48,693
At least I'm not down there
herding sheep.

325
00:33:48,777 --> 00:33:50,277
What are you doing this far north?

326
00:33:50,362 --> 00:33:53,364
The Nockmaar army
destroyed Galladoorn.

327
00:33:53,448 --> 00:33:55,074
The castle?

328
00:33:55,158 --> 00:33:57,201
Bavmorda's troops are
crushing everything in sight.

329
00:33:57,285 --> 00:33:59,203
Come on. Let me out of here, Airk.

330
00:33:59,287 --> 00:34:01,497
Give me a sword.
I'll win this war for you.

331
00:34:01,581 --> 00:34:06,001
Madmartigan. I still serve Galladoorn.

332
00:34:06,086 --> 00:34:08,045
You serve no one.

333
00:34:08,130 --> 00:34:10,381
Remember?

334
00:34:10,465 --> 00:34:13,676
Sit in your coffin and rot.

335
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:16,804
Wait, Airk. You need me!

336
00:34:16,888 --> 00:34:19,306
I'll be around long after you're dead!

337
00:34:19,391 --> 00:34:22,017
When I get out of here,
I'm gonna cut your head off...

338
00:34:22,102 --> 00:34:24,186
and stick it on a pig pole!

339
00:34:41,705 --> 00:34:46,459
I miss Kiaya and the bobbins.

340
00:34:50,839 --> 00:34:52,882
We're running out of food.

341
00:34:55,677 --> 00:34:57,928
Nobody's gonna take care of that baby.

342
00:34:58,013 --> 00:35:00,890
You know why? Nobody cares.

343
00:35:03,894 --> 00:35:05,978
Except me.

344
00:35:07,105 --> 00:35:11,692
You want to go back to your families.
I want out of this cage.

345
00:35:11,777 --> 00:35:15,738
Let me take care of that baby.
I'll look after her like she was my own.

346
00:35:15,822 --> 00:35:18,783
I believe he would, Willow.

347
00:35:18,867 --> 00:35:21,410
He doesn't know anything about babies.

348
00:35:21,495 --> 00:35:26,707
Right. But I know a lot of women who do.

349
00:35:26,792 --> 00:35:29,710
If I had somebody in my life,

350
00:35:29,795 --> 00:35:33,380
a little daughter, perhaps,

351
00:35:33,465 --> 00:35:36,717
I might have a reason to go on living.

352
00:35:39,971 --> 00:35:42,807
You can't leave me in here to die.

353
00:35:42,891 --> 00:35:45,893
Not when all I want to do is protect her.

354
00:35:59,241 --> 00:36:03,118
I feel better!

355
00:36:03,245 --> 00:36:06,914
You've done the right thing! Whoo!
Okay. All right. All right.

356
00:36:06,998 --> 00:36:11,502
- You gotta promise to feed her.
- Come to Daddy, little darlin'.

357
00:36:11,586 --> 00:36:14,755
And keep her clean.
Absolutely.

358
00:36:16,633 --> 00:36:18,676
Hee, hee, hee!

359
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:20,360
Wheee!

360
00:36:24,808 --> 00:36:26,976
She likes me.

361
00:36:29,062 --> 00:36:31,438
Here are her changing rags.

362
00:36:31,523 --> 00:36:33,732
- And her milk bladder.
- Any milk in there?

363
00:36:33,817 --> 00:36:37,987
- It's for her!
- I wouldn't steal from a baby.

364
00:36:40,949 --> 00:36:43,367
You worry too much, peck.

365
00:36:43,451 --> 00:36:46,579
It's Willow.
I mean Willow.

366
00:36:47,956 --> 00:36:53,210
Now listen, boys- Willow.
You've done the right thing.

367
00:36:53,295 --> 00:36:56,589
Now I want you to get home
and bring your crop in.

368
00:37:02,679 --> 00:37:05,055
Good-bye, little one.

369
00:37:16,192 --> 00:37:18,319
Please take good care of her.

370
00:37:20,655 --> 00:37:22,948
I give you my word of honor!

371
00:37:30,248 --> 00:37:33,584
Meegosh, slow down!
Oh, come on!

372
00:37:33,668 --> 00:37:37,880
If we hurry, we can be home by
tomorrow morning. We'll be heroes.

373
00:37:37,964 --> 00:37:41,467
Do you really think so?
Sure.

374
00:37:41,551 --> 00:37:43,802
"Look, there's Willow and Meegosh.

375
00:37:43,887 --> 00:37:46,138
The heroes have come home."

376
00:37:46,222 --> 00:37:49,266
"Welcome back, boys.
You deserve medals!"

377
00:37:49,351 --> 00:37:53,604
Yeah. Medals.

378
00:37:53,688 --> 00:37:56,941
Meegosh...

379
00:37:59,277 --> 00:38:03,447
- Did we do the right thing?
- Absolutely.

380
00:38:03,531 --> 00:38:07,701
There's nothing to worry about.

381
00:38:10,789 --> 00:38:13,082
Hyah! Ha ha!

382
00:38:13,166 --> 00:38:18,379
I stole a baby! I stole a baby!

383
00:38:18,463 --> 00:38:22,174
- Hyah!
- That's my baby!

384
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:24,259
Stop! Wait! Come back!

385
00:38:24,344 --> 00:38:27,429
Left, you stupid bird. Left! Ha ha!

386
00:38:31,393 --> 00:38:33,978
Ow!

387
00:38:34,062 --> 00:38:37,356
Brownies! Let's get out of here!

388
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:40,693
Come on, Meegosh!
Ow!

389
00:38:46,783 --> 00:38:48,784
We'll outrun 'em!

390
00:38:53,581 --> 00:38:56,917
Hey, ugly, wake up!

391
00:38:57,752 --> 00:39:00,170
Huh?

392
00:39:00,296 --> 00:39:05,342
Stand your ground. He's our prisoner.

393
00:39:05,427 --> 00:39:08,178
Meegosh, where's the baby?

394
00:39:08,263 --> 00:39:10,180
Bring the Nelwyns to me.

395
00:39:10,265 --> 00:39:11,682
All right, you heard her!

396
00:39:11,766 --> 00:39:15,519
- What's going on?
- Shut up, or I'll break your nose.

397
00:39:15,603 --> 00:39:18,022
You are mine to toy with.

398
00:39:18,106 --> 00:39:21,567
Forward!

399
00:39:21,651 --> 00:39:25,446
Gimme the rope.

400
00:39:25,530 --> 00:39:29,533
Where- Where...

401
00:39:29,617 --> 00:39:31,869
did you get that baby?

402
00:39:31,953 --> 00:39:36,665
I stole it from a stupid Daikini.

403
00:39:36,875 --> 00:39:40,002
Franjean, release the Nelwyns.

404
00:39:40,128 --> 00:39:44,381
And stop pestering them.
Uh-oh.

405
00:39:48,803 --> 00:39:50,804
Yaah!

406
00:39:59,564 --> 00:40:01,648
Welcome to my kingdom.

407
00:40:09,574 --> 00:40:14,078
I'm happy to meet you, Willow Ufgood.
How do you know my name?

408
00:40:14,162 --> 00:40:17,414
Elora Danan told me.

409
00:40:17,499 --> 00:40:20,709
Elora? Elora, Willow is here.

410
00:40:23,588 --> 00:40:29,134
- But she's just a baby.
- She's very special.

411
00:40:29,219 --> 00:40:34,556
My Brownies have been searching for her
ever since we heard she was born.

412
00:40:35,683 --> 00:40:39,561
Elora Danan has chosen you
to be her guardian.

413
00:40:39,646 --> 00:40:44,691
- Me?
- Yes. She likes you.

414
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:50,781
And Elora Danan knows
you have the courage to help us.

415
00:40:50,865 --> 00:40:54,451
Take my wand to the sorceress
Fin Raziel.

416
00:40:54,536 --> 00:40:58,789
She will guide you and Elora Danan
to the kingdom of Tir Asleen...

417
00:40:58,873 --> 00:41:01,959
where a good king and queen
will look after her.

418
00:41:02,043 --> 00:41:05,754
You need a warrior for a job like this.
I'm a nobody.

419
00:41:05,839 --> 00:41:09,216
Elora, you don't want me.

420
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:13,011
Tell her. I'm short, even for a Nelwyn.

421
00:41:17,225 --> 00:41:19,309
Hello?

422
00:41:25,942 --> 00:41:29,319
Elora Danan must survive!

423
00:41:29,404 --> 00:41:34,324
She must fulfill her destiny and bring
about the downfall of Queen Bavmorda,

424
00:41:34,409 --> 00:41:37,161
whose powers are growing
like an evil plague.

425
00:41:37,245 --> 00:41:41,665
Unless she is stopped,
Bavmorda will control the lives...

426
00:41:41,749 --> 00:41:46,253
of your village, your children- everyone.

427
00:41:50,925 --> 00:41:54,428
All creatures of good heart
need your help, Willow.

428
00:41:55,763 --> 00:41:58,307
The choice is yours.

429
00:42:22,874 --> 00:42:26,543
Hey, Meegosh. Wake up.
Huh?

430
00:42:26,628 --> 00:42:30,839
- It's time to go home.
- Home?

431
00:42:33,426 --> 00:42:38,138
Listen, Meegosh. Tell Kiaya I love her.

432
00:42:38,223 --> 00:42:41,600
- And I think of her every day.
- Willow...

433
00:42:41,684 --> 00:42:45,145
And tell her I'm not going to let
anything happen to the baby.

434
00:42:45,230 --> 00:42:47,856
Are you sure
you know what you're doing?

435
00:42:49,484 --> 00:42:52,236
I hope so.

436
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:54,488
Listen, be careful.

437
00:43:00,662 --> 00:43:04,998
I know the way, Franjean.
You always think you know the way.

438
00:43:05,083 --> 00:43:06,917
I am the leader!

439
00:43:07,043 --> 00:43:09,586
How long will it take to
find this Raziel? Not long.

440
00:43:09,671 --> 00:43:13,257
She's been exiled to an island
just over those hills.

441
00:43:13,341 --> 00:43:16,426
- She's what?
- Exiled...

442
00:43:16,511 --> 00:43:20,347
by the evil Queen Bavmorda.

443
00:43:20,431 --> 00:43:23,058
Rool, you fool. He does not need
to know everything.

444
00:43:23,184 --> 00:43:25,686
I didn't tell him everything.
You told him enough.

445
00:43:25,812 --> 00:43:28,105
You mentioned the island, the queen.
Wait a minute.

446
00:43:28,189 --> 00:43:30,816
So?

447
00:43:30,900 --> 00:43:33,694
What do you mean?
What are you saying, mysterious island?

448
00:43:33,778 --> 00:43:36,446
Don't play with that wand.

449
00:43:36,531 --> 00:43:39,032
Cherlindrea told you it holds vast powers.

450
00:43:39,117 --> 00:43:41,618
Only a great sorcerer can use it,

451
00:43:41,703 --> 00:43:44,413
not a stupid peck like you.

452
00:43:44,497 --> 00:43:47,624
This way.
No. No. No. I don't think so.

453
00:43:47,709 --> 00:43:50,002
All right, then this way.
Eh, nope.

454
00:43:50,086 --> 00:43:52,629
This way.
This way?

455
00:43:52,714 --> 00:43:56,425
That's what I said.
This way.

456
00:43:56,509 --> 00:43:59,970
- You sure you know where you're going?
- Of course.

457
00:44:00,054 --> 00:44:02,723
With us as your guides,
no harm will befall you.

458
00:44:13,151 --> 00:44:17,279
Take it up!

459
00:44:18,823 --> 00:44:23,076
We are not going in there!
But Elora needs fresh milk.

460
00:44:23,161 --> 00:44:27,998
- And we are drenched.
- You are not in command, shorty. I am!

461
00:44:28,082 --> 00:44:31,710
You hear me? Whoa!

462
00:45:09,457 --> 00:45:11,917
Excuse me? Excuse me.

463
00:45:12,001 --> 00:45:14,961
Could you spare some milk
for this poor hungry baby?

464
00:45:15,046 --> 00:45:19,341
- Get out of here, peck!
- Get outta here or we'll cook ya!

465
00:45:34,190 --> 00:45:36,608
Ooh, look at her!

466
00:45:36,692 --> 00:45:38,944
I could use a love potion on her!

467
00:45:39,028 --> 00:45:42,864
Franjean! Hey!
Give me that dust of broken heart.

468
00:45:42,949 --> 00:45:44,658
Come on! Give it to me!

469
00:45:44,742 --> 00:45:48,078
It's very dangerous.
It belongs to the fairies!

470
00:45:52,250 --> 00:45:54,334
Hey, quiet! You want to get us killed?

471
00:46:01,259 --> 00:46:04,970
Oh, Rool!
Always playing with those fairy love potions.

472
00:46:07,306 --> 00:46:12,394
You are so beautiful!

473
00:46:12,520 --> 00:46:16,106
Your eyes! Your whiskers!

474
00:46:16,232 --> 00:46:18,859
I have to kiss you!
Rool!

475
00:46:18,943 --> 00:46:20,694
That dust of broken heart!

476
00:46:35,543 --> 00:46:37,752
Beer!

477
00:46:40,882 --> 00:46:43,008
These people are crazy!
This could be bad!

478
00:46:47,555 --> 00:46:49,598
Hurry! Hurry!

479
00:46:49,682 --> 00:46:51,475
My husband's coming!

480
00:46:51,559 --> 00:46:53,643
If he catches you here,
he'll kill us both!

481
00:46:53,728 --> 00:46:56,396
- How do I look?
- Not you!

482
00:46:57,565 --> 00:46:59,483
Where the hell did you come from?

483
00:46:59,567 --> 00:47:01,818
I knew I shouldn't have trusted you.

484
00:47:01,903 --> 00:47:05,614
Don't I know you?
I stole the baby from you, Daikini,

485
00:47:05,740 --> 00:47:07,949
while you were taking a pee-pee!
Cover your face!

486
00:47:08,075 --> 00:47:11,703
You are crawling with Brownies.
I hate Brownies!

487
00:47:11,787 --> 00:47:14,539
Whoa!

488
00:47:14,624 --> 00:47:17,209
- Where is he? Where?
- Hello, dear.

489
00:47:17,293 --> 00:47:19,669
There's nobody here
but me and, uh, my, uh...

490
00:47:19,754 --> 00:47:22,172
I'll kill him!
...my cousin, Hilda.

491
00:47:22,256 --> 00:47:24,466
- Hilda?
- Hilda.

492
00:47:24,592 --> 00:47:26,676
Oh, Hilda!
This is my husband, Llug.

493
00:47:26,761 --> 00:47:29,513
- Mm. Big husband.
- Yes.

494
00:47:29,639 --> 00:47:31,473
How do you do?

495
00:47:31,557 --> 00:47:33,850
Hilda! Ooh.

496
00:47:33,935 --> 00:47:36,102
Come on, girly. Don't be shy.

497
00:47:36,187 --> 00:47:38,772
Hey! Give her back!

498
00:47:38,898 --> 00:47:41,274
Pecks make terrible nursemaids.
Nursemaid?

499
00:47:41,359 --> 00:47:44,236
They get too excited.

500
00:47:44,320 --> 00:47:46,947
Excuse me! Are we having a party?

501
00:47:47,031 --> 00:47:49,074
Huh?
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

502
00:47:49,158 --> 00:47:53,787
Stop, please. Ooh.

503
00:47:53,871 --> 00:47:55,705
Come on. Fight like a man!

504
00:47:55,790 --> 00:47:58,833
Want to breed?

505
00:47:58,918 --> 00:48:01,920
Tempting, but no.

506
00:48:04,840 --> 00:48:06,716
Thank you. Time to leave.

507
00:48:06,842 --> 00:48:08,760
Bye, Hilda! Take them out.

508
00:48:08,844 --> 00:48:11,930
Hey! Come along!

509
00:48:12,056 --> 00:48:14,683
Careful, you lout!
Move along!

510
00:48:14,767 --> 00:48:17,477
Gather up all these babies.

511
00:48:17,562 --> 00:48:19,813
That baby over there.
Let me see its arm.

512
00:48:23,526 --> 00:48:25,694
That's not the one.

513
00:48:29,365 --> 00:48:32,117
You! Are you the mother of that child?

514
00:48:32,243 --> 00:48:34,828
Yes.
Yes, I am. Let me see it.

515
00:48:34,912 --> 00:48:36,496
No! Don't let her!

516
00:48:36,581 --> 00:48:38,039
Aah!

517
00:48:38,124 --> 00:48:40,959
I gave you an order, woman!

518
00:48:50,344 --> 00:48:53,763
You- You're... beautiful.

519
00:48:53,889 --> 00:48:57,225
And you're very strong.
Thank you.

520
00:48:59,770 --> 00:49:02,272
You're no woman!

521
00:49:02,356 --> 00:49:04,149
Now, honey, take it easy.

522
00:49:04,233 --> 00:49:07,152
- Gentlemen.
- Not a woman?

523
00:49:07,236 --> 00:49:10,030
Meet Llug.

524
00:49:11,324 --> 00:49:13,366
- After them!
- Out of the way!

525
00:49:19,665 --> 00:49:20,874
To the horses!

526
00:49:31,427 --> 00:49:33,345
Hyah!

527
00:49:33,429 --> 00:49:37,349
Madmartigan! Madmartigan! Wait!

528
00:49:40,811 --> 00:49:43,563
He's not a woman!

529
00:49:45,775 --> 00:49:48,068
Don't let them get away!

530
00:49:49,820 --> 00:49:53,239
Madmartigan, stop!

531
00:50:12,218 --> 00:50:14,761
Madmartigan, I'm warning you...

532
00:50:16,764 --> 00:50:20,433
- Ow!
- Prepare to die!

533
00:50:43,833 --> 00:50:46,167
Madmartigan! Stop!

534
00:51:02,184 --> 00:51:05,353
No... more... beer.

535
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:18,324
Franjean, help me!

536
00:51:22,913 --> 00:51:24,789
Rool!
Help!

537
00:51:24,874 --> 00:51:28,001
Rool! Rool.

538
00:51:29,170 --> 00:51:32,964
- Rool! What are you doing?
- Help me!

539
00:51:38,304 --> 00:51:40,555
Come on. I am.
Pull me in.

540
00:51:40,639 --> 00:51:43,141
Yeah, pull!

541
00:52:09,210 --> 00:52:10,919
Whoa!

542
00:52:17,676 --> 00:52:21,221
Rool, this isn't funny!
Help me cut the rope!

543
00:52:34,401 --> 00:52:37,153
Who-oa!

544
00:52:58,634 --> 00:53:01,261
Willow, stay down!

545
00:53:04,974 --> 00:53:09,269
Whoa!

546
00:53:09,353 --> 00:53:11,312
Have you gone crazy?

547
00:53:11,397 --> 00:53:13,523
You can't chase around
with Elora like this.

548
00:53:13,607 --> 00:53:16,025
- We're getting off!
- Hyah!

549
00:53:16,110 --> 00:53:18,736
Hyah!

550
00:53:41,510 --> 00:53:43,970
Whoa! Whoa!

551
00:53:47,224 --> 00:53:49,559
Oh, Rool.

552
00:53:49,643 --> 00:53:52,312
Now we stop, peck.

553
00:53:53,397 --> 00:53:58,693
Stupid Daikini.
Ask him to stop the wagon.

554
00:53:58,777 --> 00:54:02,989
Madmartigan! You never, ever
drive that fast with an infant!

555
00:54:04,408 --> 00:54:06,993
I just saved that infant's life!

556
00:54:08,454 --> 00:54:10,747
Hah! Hah!

557
00:54:10,831 --> 00:54:12,749
Gather your wits. Come on.

558
00:54:12,833 --> 00:54:15,877
- Don't worry about me.
- Come on!

559
00:54:16,921 --> 00:54:19,130
Get down!

560
00:54:19,214 --> 00:54:21,633
Uh, where am I? Oh!

561
00:54:23,510 --> 00:54:25,595
Rool, you fool, get out of the road!

562
00:54:42,071 --> 00:54:44,656
Ah, Franjean!
You better clear out, Willow.

563
00:54:44,740 --> 00:54:46,199
Before those troops come back.

564
00:54:46,283 --> 00:54:49,744
- Ah, my head!
- We don't need him, Elora.

565
00:54:58,128 --> 00:55:00,213
Madmartigan, wait!

566
00:55:00,297 --> 00:55:03,633
Go home, Willow! It's a dangerous world.

567
00:55:03,717 --> 00:55:05,677
Yeah, and that's why
we need your help.

568
00:55:05,761 --> 00:55:08,972
My help? What
do you need my help for?

569
00:55:09,056 --> 00:55:11,182
You're a sorcerer!

570
00:55:11,266 --> 00:55:14,519
You're a great warrior
and a swordsman.

571
00:55:14,603 --> 00:55:17,480
And you're ten times
bigger than I am, stupid!

572
00:55:17,564 --> 00:55:20,817
Are you trying to make my life
more difficult than it already is?

573
00:55:24,113 --> 00:55:28,992
Hurry! Big dogs!

574
00:55:29,076 --> 00:55:33,329
Look. I'm sorry I got angry.

575
00:55:33,414 --> 00:55:35,373
We wouldn't have escaped without you.

576
00:55:49,513 --> 00:55:52,390
Well, don't expect me to help you again.

577
00:55:53,851 --> 00:55:57,478
Good! Then we go that way!
To the lake!

578
00:55:58,564 --> 00:56:01,691
That way.

579
00:56:01,775 --> 00:56:05,361
You are drunk, and when
you are drunk, you forget that...

580
00:56:05,446 --> 00:56:07,363
I am in charge!
You are in charge.

581
00:56:07,448 --> 00:56:09,657
Fine. Then which way do we go?

582
00:56:09,742 --> 00:56:11,743
That way!

583
00:56:14,788 --> 00:56:19,333
Oh, no! That's the way I'm going.

584
00:56:19,418 --> 00:56:22,378
All right, all right.
You can follow me as far as the lake.

585
00:56:22,463 --> 00:56:24,630
But that's it!

586
00:56:24,715 --> 00:56:28,509
- You're not going south, are you?
- No, just as far as the lake.

587
00:56:28,594 --> 00:56:33,723
Good. Jumbo. Jumbo. I am hungry.
Go get me some eggs or something.

588
00:56:33,807 --> 00:56:36,434
- We are not afraid of you!
- Now!

589
00:56:43,150 --> 00:56:47,820
Kael, have you found the child?

590
00:56:47,905 --> 00:56:49,655
The search goes on, my queen.

591
00:56:50,699 --> 00:56:52,742
Why, with my powers,

592
00:56:52,826 --> 00:56:56,037
with the strength of my great army,

593
00:56:56,121 --> 00:56:59,499
can you not find one little child?

594
00:56:59,583 --> 00:57:01,918
We look even now. It won't be long.

595
00:57:02,002 --> 00:57:05,379
Find the child. Find the child!

596
00:57:05,464 --> 00:57:08,049
Time is running out.

597
00:57:15,557 --> 00:57:18,392
- Good night.
- She is kinda cute.

598
00:57:20,104 --> 00:57:21,854
When she's quiet.

599
00:57:23,232 --> 00:57:25,191
She's really a princess.

600
00:57:25,275 --> 00:57:29,278
Really? And you're a great sorcerer.

601
00:57:29,363 --> 00:57:31,280
And I'm the king of Kashmir.

602
00:57:31,365 --> 00:57:35,159
Go to sleep, Willow.

603
00:57:35,244 --> 00:57:37,745
Good night, Madmartigan.

604
00:57:37,830 --> 00:57:40,790
Rats! Big rats! Rats!

605
00:57:40,874 --> 00:57:44,168
Uh- Uh! Oh! Rats! Ra...

606
00:57:44,253 --> 00:57:49,173
Oh, Rool, you and that
stupid rat dream! Ha!

607
00:57:57,933 --> 00:58:00,685
Tuatha...

608
00:58:00,769 --> 00:58:02,895
Lawkathok...

609
00:58:02,980 --> 00:58:04,939
Tuatha!

610
00:58:05,023 --> 00:58:07,733
Huh? Willow?

611
00:58:08,777 --> 00:58:10,945
Willow?

612
00:58:12,739 --> 00:58:15,158
Oh. There you are.

613
00:58:15,242 --> 00:58:17,201
Madmartigan!

614
00:58:17,286 --> 00:58:20,621
Night, Willow.

615
00:58:32,676 --> 00:58:34,760
This way! This way!

616
00:58:46,481 --> 00:58:48,399
What are you doing?

617
00:58:48,483 --> 00:58:50,860
I found some black root.
She loves it!

618
00:58:50,944 --> 00:58:53,863
Black root?
I am the father of two children,

619
00:58:53,947 --> 00:58:55,990
and you never, ever
give a baby black root.

620
00:58:56,074 --> 00:58:59,202
Well, my mother raised us on black root.

621
00:58:59,286 --> 00:59:01,829
It's good for ya!
It puts hair on your chest.

622
00:59:01,955 --> 00:59:04,624
Doesn't it, Sticks?
Her name is not Sticks.

623
00:59:04,708 --> 00:59:07,627
She's Elora Danan,
the future empress of Tir Asleen.

624
00:59:07,711 --> 00:59:10,046
And the last thing she's gonna want
is a hairy chest!

625
00:59:14,218 --> 00:59:16,219
Did you see what he did?

626
00:59:16,303 --> 00:59:19,597
He stole our black root.
I'll get some more. Don't worry about it.

627
00:59:24,478 --> 00:59:27,813
There it is! The island!

628
00:59:29,983 --> 00:59:31,943
We made it.

629
00:59:32,027 --> 00:59:36,530
We have led you to the
island of the sorceress Fin Raziel.

630
00:59:36,657 --> 00:59:40,952
We'll get a boat in that village.
A big boat.

631
00:59:58,929 --> 01:00:00,972
Well, looks like I got you here.

632
01:00:01,056 --> 01:00:03,432
You! What did you do?

633
01:00:03,517 --> 01:00:06,602
All you did was hang around
and eat our eggs! Huh?

634
01:00:06,687 --> 01:00:08,646
I found a boat. We're all set.

635
01:00:08,730 --> 01:00:12,608
Good. Take these two lizards
out and drown them.

636
01:00:12,734 --> 01:00:15,987
Lizards! Who are you calling lizards?
Heh? Heh?

637
01:00:18,156 --> 01:00:20,783
Your mother was a lizard!

638
01:00:23,829 --> 01:00:26,372
Good-bye, Sticks.

639
01:00:28,959 --> 01:00:33,296
If you really are a princess,
take care of him.

640
01:00:41,305 --> 01:00:44,598
- Madmartigan!
- What?

641
01:00:44,683 --> 01:00:46,559
Thanks.

642
01:00:56,069 --> 01:00:58,612
Hey! Aah!

643
01:00:58,697 --> 01:01:01,991
Keep walkin', hero!
Don't even turn around!

644
01:01:03,243 --> 01:01:06,203
It's all right, Elora.

645
01:01:06,288 --> 01:01:08,706
Go to sleep.

646
01:01:08,790 --> 01:01:12,793
Nobody'll find you here.
I'll be back with Fin Raziel very soon.

647
01:01:12,878 --> 01:01:16,213
We will guard her with our meager lives.

648
01:01:44,493 --> 01:01:47,286
Raziel!

649
01:01:47,371 --> 01:01:51,207
Fin Raziel! I have to talk to you, please!

650
01:01:55,128 --> 01:01:57,713
Raziel!

651
01:02:02,552 --> 01:02:06,222
She's not here.

652
01:02:09,184 --> 01:02:11,143
Aah!

653
01:02:11,228 --> 01:02:14,772
Get back! Who are you?

654
01:02:15,899 --> 01:02:18,818
Who are you?

655
01:02:21,196 --> 01:02:24,281
- I'm Willow Ufgood.
- What are you doing here?

656
01:02:24,366 --> 01:02:28,035
I've come to find
the great sorceress, Fin Raziel.

657
01:02:28,120 --> 01:02:30,704
That's me! I'm Raziel!

658
01:02:32,707 --> 01:02:34,667
This can't be right!

659
01:02:34,751 --> 01:02:38,295
One of Bavmorda's spells
transformed me.

660
01:02:40,549 --> 01:02:43,134
Believe me, it could have been worse!

661
01:02:43,218 --> 01:02:49,014
Oh. Well, this wand is for you.
It's from Cherlindrea.

662
01:02:49,099 --> 01:02:53,602
Then the prophecy is true.
The princess has been born.

663
01:02:53,687 --> 01:02:55,646
Take me to her.

664
01:02:58,191 --> 01:03:00,943
It is Elora Danan.

665
01:03:01,027 --> 01:03:03,946
Isn't she beautiful?

666
01:03:04,030 --> 01:03:06,991
Isn't she beautiful?

667
01:03:07,075 --> 01:03:10,536
That's Raziel?
I don't know. I...

668
01:03:10,620 --> 01:03:12,872
I expected something more grand.
Less, uh...

669
01:03:12,956 --> 01:03:14,915
Fuzzy.
Fuzzy!

670
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:18,794
You must use the wand.
Turn me back into my human form.

671
01:03:18,879 --> 01:03:22,214
- What do I do?
- You mean you're not a sorcerer?

672
01:03:23,467 --> 01:03:25,926
Yes. Sorta.

673
01:03:26,052 --> 01:03:28,596
I'm a farmer.

674
01:03:28,680 --> 01:03:30,556
But I do know a few tricks.

675
01:03:30,640 --> 01:03:35,895
Tricks? Cherlindrea sent you?
You must learn real magic.

676
01:03:36,104 --> 01:03:40,149
Horses! Horses!

677
01:03:40,233 --> 01:03:42,735
Quick! Take her! Hurry! Hurry!

678
01:03:51,578 --> 01:03:54,580
I knew he was a traitor!

679
01:03:57,125 --> 01:03:59,752
Sorry about this, peck.
Keep your mouth shut!

680
01:04:00,921 --> 01:04:03,672
Told you we'd find him without your help.

681
01:04:03,757 --> 01:04:05,716
Give me that baby.
No!

682
01:04:09,179 --> 01:04:13,140
- Give her back!
- Leave me alone! Don't touch me!

683
01:04:19,064 --> 01:04:20,940
This is the one we're looking for.

684
01:04:21,024 --> 01:04:24,443
We must take it back to Nockmaar.

685
01:04:27,197 --> 01:04:29,114
Lose your skirt?

686
01:04:36,790 --> 01:04:38,707
I've still got what counts.

687
01:04:38,792 --> 01:04:41,126
Not for long.

688
01:04:46,967 --> 01:04:50,511
- Bring him.
- Over here!

689
01:05:08,196 --> 01:05:10,864
We'll never keep up with those horses.

690
01:05:10,991 --> 01:05:14,410
Then we will have to track them.
That would take forever.

691
01:05:14,494 --> 01:05:17,246
Besides, even if we find them,
they'll catch us,

692
01:05:17,330 --> 01:05:20,499
stick us in cages, torture us
and finally devour us.

693
01:05:20,584 --> 01:05:22,501
Are you suggesting we go home?

694
01:05:22,627 --> 01:05:25,504
Nah. This is more fun!
All right.

695
01:05:25,589 --> 01:05:27,548
Fine, then. Come on!

696
01:05:41,354 --> 01:05:44,773
I'm worried about Elora.
She doesn't sound good.

697
01:05:44,858 --> 01:05:47,610
Hurry! Practice the chant I taught you!

698
01:05:47,694 --> 01:05:53,490
Tanna... looatha-
Oh, I can't remember the middle part.

699
01:05:53,575 --> 01:05:55,618
Locktwaar!

700
01:05:55,702 --> 01:05:58,704
That's the word that pleads for change.

701
01:05:58,788 --> 01:06:00,664
Locktwaar.

702
01:06:04,377 --> 01:06:07,504
Elora's cold and hungry. She knows me.

703
01:06:07,589 --> 01:06:09,548
Please, let me take care of her.

704
01:06:09,633 --> 01:06:11,759
I don't need help from a peck.

705
01:06:15,513 --> 01:06:19,516
- What are you staring at?
- Your leg.

706
01:06:19,601 --> 01:06:21,977
I'd like to break it.

707
01:06:22,062 --> 01:06:24,688
You may find that difficult, slave,

708
01:06:24,773 --> 01:06:26,940
while I'm up here and you're down there.

709
01:06:30,070 --> 01:06:32,279
I hate that woman.

710
01:07:04,938 --> 01:07:06,980
Hyah!

711
01:07:10,819 --> 01:07:13,612
I found it, Kael.

712
01:07:14,739 --> 01:07:17,783
That should make my mother happy.

713
01:07:17,867 --> 01:07:20,869
What are they gonna do to her?

714
01:07:33,425 --> 01:07:36,093
Hither walha...

715
01:07:36,177 --> 01:07:39,680
bairn deru bordak...

716
01:07:39,806 --> 01:07:41,724
bellanockt.

717
01:07:41,808 --> 01:07:44,601
That's magic?
Smells terrible.

718
01:07:44,728 --> 01:07:47,938
It's the life spark. It forms after-
Well, it stinks!

719
01:07:48,022 --> 01:07:51,233
- This whole thing stinks!
- Ignore him, Willow.

720
01:07:51,317 --> 01:07:54,236
- He's a fool!
- If only I had a sword!

721
01:07:54,362 --> 01:07:57,489
If only you'd quit talking about it.

722
01:07:57,574 --> 01:08:00,909
Willow, you must transform me
to my human self.

723
01:08:00,994 --> 01:08:03,829
But, Raziel, I'm not ready yet.

724
01:08:03,913 --> 01:08:07,124
You'd better be. Get me down.

725
01:08:10,754 --> 01:08:13,172
Ow!

726
01:08:15,759 --> 01:08:18,802
Why don't you help me get out of here
instead of chattering with that muskrat?

727
01:08:18,887 --> 01:08:21,597
Muskrat! When I change back...

728
01:08:21,681 --> 01:08:25,642
to my former self, I will crush this army...

729
01:08:25,727 --> 01:08:28,395
and take Elora Danan to Tir Asleen...

730
01:08:28,480 --> 01:08:31,064
where she will be safe.

731
01:08:31,149 --> 01:08:33,442
Ow!

732
01:08:33,526 --> 01:08:35,486
What'd you bite me for?

733
01:08:35,570 --> 01:08:38,864
You need three drops
of your blood to put in the potion.

734
01:08:38,948 --> 01:08:42,242
Well, you could've warned me.

735
01:08:42,327 --> 01:08:44,745
For beginners, there's some pain,

736
01:08:44,829 --> 01:08:49,917
but don't let anything
break your concentration.

737
01:08:55,048 --> 01:08:57,883
Hither greenan bairn claideb lunanockt.

738
01:08:58,009 --> 01:09:01,762
Hello, everybody! We have arrived!
You are saved.

739
01:09:01,846 --> 01:09:04,681
- Shh!
- Don't interrupt.

740
01:09:06,100 --> 01:09:09,269
Hither greenan bairn claideb lunanockt.

741
01:09:09,354 --> 01:09:12,189
What are you gonna look like
if this works?

742
01:09:12,273 --> 01:09:14,733
- Don't interrupt.
- Sorry.

743
01:09:14,818 --> 01:09:16,777
Hither greenan bairn claideb lunanockt.

744
01:09:16,861 --> 01:09:20,155
I am a young, beautiful woman.

745
01:09:20,240 --> 01:09:22,032
Concentrate, Willow.

746
01:09:22,116 --> 01:09:26,745
Hither greenan bairn claideb lunanockt.

747
01:09:26,830 --> 01:09:28,914
No! You're losing me!

748
01:09:29,040 --> 01:09:32,459
Hither greenan bairn claideb lunanockt.

749
01:09:35,421 --> 01:09:37,297
Hither greenan bairn claideb...

750
01:09:37,423 --> 01:09:40,425
Aah! Aah!
You all right? Nice try, Willow.

751
01:09:48,518 --> 01:09:52,479
Farmers! Cherlindrea sends me farmers!

752
01:09:52,564 --> 01:09:56,024
Whew!
The Nelwyn really butchered that one.

753
01:09:56,109 --> 01:09:57,943
I'm sorry, Raziel.

754
01:09:58,152 --> 01:10:02,364
You want out?
Easy. We can pick a lock. Come on.

755
01:10:02,448 --> 01:10:04,366
No. No, no. Like this!

756
01:10:04,450 --> 01:10:06,368
I know what I'm doing.
It's my spear. Leave it alone.

757
01:10:06,452 --> 01:10:10,372
Let me do it. Out of the way, rodents.

758
01:10:11,457 --> 01:10:13,250
Take your hand off that.

759
01:10:13,334 --> 01:10:17,754
You leave that alone,
you stupid, fat Daikini!

760
01:10:17,839 --> 01:10:19,506
Ow!

761
01:10:19,591 --> 01:10:21,675
Dust of broken hearts.

762
01:10:32,437 --> 01:10:35,230
Ha, ha! You are free!

763
01:10:35,315 --> 01:10:39,526
Come on, Madmartigan.
Let's get Elora Danan out of here.

764
01:10:39,652 --> 01:10:43,822
Yeah. It'll be fun.
Come on!

765
01:10:55,501 --> 01:10:59,504
Are you all right?
Yeah.

766
01:10:59,589 --> 01:11:01,673
I feel... good.

767
01:11:01,799 --> 01:11:05,344
The dust of broken hearts.
Ah...

768
01:11:05,428 --> 01:11:07,971
Hey, come on!

769
01:11:13,436 --> 01:11:16,521
Let me see!
Let me see. You always see.

770
01:11:16,606 --> 01:11:19,066
There's Elora, right there, on those furs.

771
01:11:21,486 --> 01:11:23,612
Hey, wait! Leave this to us.

772
01:11:23,696 --> 01:11:26,448
- It's too dangerous for you.
- Only one of us should go in there.

773
01:11:26,532 --> 01:11:29,368
I've had experience in this sort of thing.
I know what I'm doing.

774
01:11:56,646 --> 01:11:59,523
Uh-oh.

775
01:11:59,607 --> 01:12:03,568
Wait. Shh. No! No!

776
01:12:14,080 --> 01:12:16,873
I love you. Madmartigan!

777
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:19,960
What are you doing?
Take the baby and go! Come on!

778
01:12:20,044 --> 01:12:21,962
Come on!

779
01:12:32,015 --> 01:12:34,224
- Oh, Sorsha.
- Oh!

780
01:12:35,977 --> 01:12:38,979
Wake from this hateful sleep.

781
01:12:39,063 --> 01:12:41,440
It deprives me of your beauty.

782
01:12:41,524 --> 01:12:45,485
- The beauty of your eyes-
- One move, jackass,

783
01:12:45,570 --> 01:12:47,946
and you really will be a woman.

784
01:12:49,323 --> 01:12:53,243
You are my sun! My moon!

785
01:12:53,327 --> 01:12:57,748
My starlit sky.
Without you, I dwell in darkness.

786
01:12:57,874 --> 01:13:01,960
I love you.
What are you doing here?

787
01:13:02,045 --> 01:13:05,380
Your power has enchanted me.
I stand helpless against it.

788
01:13:05,465 --> 01:13:07,382
Come to me, now.

789
01:13:07,467 --> 01:13:09,885
Tonight, let me worship you
in my arms.

790
01:13:10,011 --> 01:13:12,721
Get away from me!
I love you!

791
01:13:12,805 --> 01:13:15,265
Stop saying that!

792
01:13:15,349 --> 01:13:19,561
How can I stop the beating of my heart?
It pounds like never before.

793
01:13:19,687 --> 01:13:22,272
Out of fear.
Out of love!

794
01:13:22,356 --> 01:13:24,858
I can stop it. I'll kill you.

795
01:13:24,942 --> 01:13:27,861
Death, next to love, is a trivial thing.

796
01:13:30,656 --> 01:13:33,158
Your touch is worth 100,000 deaths.

797
01:13:38,039 --> 01:13:40,707
What goes on here?

798
01:13:44,712 --> 01:13:46,713
Deceiver!

799
01:13:48,299 --> 01:13:50,175
Stop him!

800
01:13:59,102 --> 01:14:01,728
Captain, get up!

801
01:14:12,156 --> 01:14:16,785
You are great.

802
01:14:16,869 --> 01:14:19,746
Get on that shield!

803
01:14:31,092 --> 01:14:33,718
Sorsha!

804
01:14:36,389 --> 01:14:38,390
After them!

805
01:14:45,106 --> 01:14:47,482
Whoa! Hey!

806
01:14:52,280 --> 01:14:54,239
They're getting away!

807
01:15:03,082 --> 01:15:05,292
Follow me, Rool. I don't know.
Where are you?

808
01:15:05,418 --> 01:15:09,588
Aah! Ooh.
Oh, no, where did everybody go?

809
01:15:09,672 --> 01:15:11,631
Maybe it was something we said.

810
01:16:05,686 --> 01:16:08,813
Ohh-h-h-h!

811
01:16:30,002 --> 01:16:32,003
Madmartigan!

812
01:16:48,813 --> 01:16:53,024
Madmartigan!
What the hell happened up there?

813
01:16:53,109 --> 01:16:55,527
You started spouting poetry.

814
01:16:55,611 --> 01:16:58,196
Poetry?
Yeah.

815
01:16:58,281 --> 01:17:01,491
"I love you, Sorsha.
I worship you, Sorsha."

816
01:17:01,575 --> 01:17:03,535
You almost got us killed!

817
01:17:03,619 --> 01:17:05,495
"I love you, Sorsha"?

818
01:17:05,579 --> 01:17:07,998
I don't love her.
She kicked me in the face.

819
01:17:08,082 --> 01:17:11,501
I hate her! Don't I?

820
01:17:13,713 --> 01:17:16,131
Kael! Kael!

821
01:17:16,215 --> 01:17:18,883
Nockmaar soldiers!

822
01:17:20,886 --> 01:17:24,347
Hide! Get the children! Come on!

823
01:17:27,101 --> 01:17:29,019
Get the children!
They're after us!

824
01:17:29,103 --> 01:17:32,230
Come on. Follow me.
Quick! Come on! Move!

825
01:17:48,706 --> 01:17:51,458
I knew you'd get out of that rattrap.

826
01:17:54,086 --> 01:17:56,004
You left me to die, Airk.

827
01:17:56,088 --> 01:17:59,341
I probably saved your life.
We were slaughtered, and I lost a lot...

828
01:17:59,425 --> 01:18:01,760
Shh! Quiet!

829
01:18:02,845 --> 01:18:04,804
Tear this village apart!

830
01:18:04,889 --> 01:18:09,267
Look everywhere! Find the child!

831
01:18:18,152 --> 01:18:21,613
Shh!

832
01:18:27,453 --> 01:18:29,371
Shh-shh-shh!

833
01:18:45,096 --> 01:18:48,098
Tell Sorsha I search the north bank!

834
01:18:48,182 --> 01:18:50,100
Hah! Hah!
Yes, General.

835
01:19:03,239 --> 01:19:05,323
Quiet. Shh!

836
01:19:24,677 --> 01:19:27,679
- Sorsha!
- Back.

837
01:19:27,763 --> 01:19:29,363
Back!

838
01:19:38,774 --> 01:19:43,027
Keep the baby quiet.
She needs to be changed.

839
01:19:43,112 --> 01:19:44,863
Nockmaar scum!
You'll never defeat us.

840
01:19:44,947 --> 01:19:46,739
Give up the baby!
Shut up!

841
01:19:48,784 --> 01:19:50,452
What does Bavmorda want
with this baby, anyway?

842
01:19:50,536 --> 01:19:52,245
She's a princess.

843
01:19:52,371 --> 01:19:54,205
We're taking her to Tir Asleen.
Tir Asleen?

844
01:19:54,290 --> 01:19:57,167
Even if you could find it, peck,

845
01:19:57,251 --> 01:19:59,627
she's right- you'd never
get past the Nockmaar army.

846
01:19:59,712 --> 01:20:02,172
There's an even bigger army
at Tir Asleen.

847
01:20:02,256 --> 01:20:04,757
If we can just get there...

848
01:20:08,179 --> 01:20:10,930
I've lost more than half my men
fighting Bavmorda.

849
01:20:11,015 --> 01:20:13,558
Now you and this peck
are gonna take her on?

850
01:20:13,642 --> 01:20:16,895
You always told me you served
no one, Madmartigan.

851
01:20:16,979 --> 01:20:18,938
Since when are you a crusader?

852
01:20:21,233 --> 01:20:24,486
He's not gonna help you, peck.

853
01:20:24,570 --> 01:20:26,571
He's a worthless thief.

854
01:20:27,948 --> 01:20:30,408
I'm not a thief, Airk.

855
01:20:30,493 --> 01:20:33,453
He's not a thief.

856
01:20:33,537 --> 01:20:35,747
Are you?

857
01:20:50,304 --> 01:20:54,140
I serve the Nelwyn, Airk.

858
01:20:58,812 --> 01:21:01,439
- Want to come with us?
- You'll never make it, Madmartigan.

859
01:21:03,400 --> 01:21:05,318
Then once again we say good-bye.

860
01:21:19,124 --> 01:21:22,544
- Over here!
- Sorsha!

861
01:21:22,628 --> 01:21:26,005
Weapons down or she's dead!

862
01:21:31,220 --> 01:21:32,929
Hyah! Hyah!

863
01:21:38,561 --> 01:21:41,479
Hyah!
Get to your horses! After 'em!

864
01:22:27,693 --> 01:22:30,153
This way! This way!

865
01:22:30,237 --> 01:22:32,947
As the crow flies, you fools!

866
01:22:39,872 --> 01:22:42,665
You're holding me too tight!
I don't want you to get away.

867
01:22:42,750 --> 01:22:47,587
Why? Because I'm your sun,
your moon, your starlit sky?

868
01:22:49,214 --> 01:22:51,424
Get your hair out of my face,
or I'll chop it off.

869
01:22:55,262 --> 01:22:59,182
Did I really- Did I really
say those things last night?

870
01:22:59,266 --> 01:23:02,393
In your tent?
You said you loved me.

871
01:23:02,478 --> 01:23:04,979
I don't remember that.
You lied to me!

872
01:23:05,064 --> 01:23:07,482
No, I...

873
01:23:07,566 --> 01:23:09,984
I just wasn't myself last night.

874
01:23:10,069 --> 01:23:14,364
I suppose my power enchanted you,
and you were helpless against it.

875
01:23:14,448 --> 01:23:17,408
Um, sort of.
Then what?

876
01:23:17,493 --> 01:23:19,619
It went away.

877
01:23:19,703 --> 01:23:23,331
It went away?
"I dwell in darkness without you,"

878
01:23:23,415 --> 01:23:25,500
and it went away?
Yeah.

879
01:23:36,637 --> 01:23:40,765
Whoa.

880
01:23:47,564 --> 01:23:49,982
Hurry! Kael's coming!

881
01:23:54,530 --> 01:23:56,823
Madmartigan, come on! Now!

882
01:24:04,832 --> 01:24:08,418
Madmartigan, come on!

883
01:24:08,502 --> 01:24:11,295
They're coming! Away!

884
01:24:11,380 --> 01:24:13,631
Go on! Hyah!

885
01:24:30,649 --> 01:24:33,776
Whoa! Whoa!

886
01:24:33,861 --> 01:24:36,028
This way!

887
01:24:41,535 --> 01:24:45,371
Tir Asleen! At last, Tir Asleen!

888
01:24:56,258 --> 01:24:58,176
Hello?

889
01:24:58,260 --> 01:25:00,803
Hello?

890
01:25:04,933 --> 01:25:08,478
Hello?

891
01:25:08,562 --> 01:25:10,813
Why did I listen to you, peck?

892
01:25:10,898 --> 01:25:14,817
"Everything will be all right
once we get to Tir Asleen."

893
01:25:14,902 --> 01:25:16,986
The only army around here...

894
01:25:17,070 --> 01:25:20,531
is the one that's about to ride
across this valley and wipe us out!

895
01:25:20,616 --> 01:25:23,659
But Cherlindrea said we'd be safe here.

896
01:25:23,744 --> 01:25:27,121
Safe? Look at these people.

897
01:25:27,206 --> 01:25:31,459
This place is cursed, peck.
It's falling apart. Open your eyes!

898
01:25:31,585 --> 01:25:35,213
And it...

899
01:25:35,297 --> 01:25:37,381
Trolls.

900
01:25:39,968 --> 01:25:42,094
I hate trolls.

901
01:25:43,180 --> 01:25:45,598
This is the work of Bavmorda.

902
01:25:54,274 --> 01:25:57,318
Willow? The wand.

903
01:25:57,444 --> 01:26:00,863
Turn me back into my human form.
Are you sure?

904
01:26:16,755 --> 01:26:19,006
Yeah.

905
01:26:19,091 --> 01:26:21,133
Good.

906
01:26:27,766 --> 01:26:29,851
Hurry, Willow. Transform me.

907
01:26:29,935 --> 01:26:32,895
I can't do it. I'm just not a sorcerer.

908
01:26:32,980 --> 01:26:35,690
But you can be. Speak...

909
01:26:35,774 --> 01:26:38,442
and be one with the words.

910
01:26:38,527 --> 01:26:42,113
Avalorium, greenan...

911
01:26:42,197 --> 01:26:45,533
luatha, tye...

912
01:26:45,617 --> 01:26:49,579
Oh, Willow, you're losing me.

913
01:26:51,790 --> 01:26:54,917
Madmartigan, Kael's coming!

914
01:26:55,002 --> 01:26:58,004
Willow, you idiot.

915
01:26:58,130 --> 01:27:00,172
Raziel? Willow,

916
01:27:00,257 --> 01:27:02,800
arm that catapult up there.

917
01:27:21,987 --> 01:27:24,322
Whoa! Whoa!

918
01:27:24,406 --> 01:27:29,952
- Good work, Madmartigan.
- What the hell happened to you?

919
01:27:30,037 --> 01:27:32,663
Assault! Sorsha, battering ram!

920
01:27:37,336 --> 01:27:39,337
Cut it down!

921
01:27:50,349 --> 01:27:52,391
Faster!

922
01:28:06,865 --> 01:28:11,202
Forward! Break it down!

923
01:28:30,806 --> 01:28:33,391
Again! Again!

924
01:28:37,980 --> 01:28:40,439
Willow, use the wand on that troll.

925
01:28:42,693 --> 01:28:46,070
Bellalockt!

926
01:28:55,789 --> 01:28:59,709
Ewww!

927
01:29:07,259 --> 01:29:10,761
Break it down! Forward!

928
01:29:26,611 --> 01:29:30,156
Whoa! Whoa!

929
01:29:57,934 --> 01:30:00,352
Get him!

930
01:30:22,167 --> 01:30:23,834
The other side!

931
01:30:38,475 --> 01:30:40,768
Destroy the beast! Find the baby!

932
01:30:40,852 --> 01:30:43,521
Baaa! Take tha-a-a-at!

933
01:31:55,802 --> 01:31:58,095
Willow!

934
01:32:19,659 --> 01:32:22,453
Madmartigan, help!

935
01:32:24,122 --> 01:32:26,665
Willow!

936
01:32:33,715 --> 01:32:37,551
Get him, Madmartigan!

937
01:32:45,769 --> 01:32:47,311
Here.

938
01:33:02,953 --> 01:33:05,162
The baby!

939
01:34:07,058 --> 01:34:10,185
Airk's army. Get Kael!

940
01:34:10,270 --> 01:34:12,688
Airk's army!

941
01:34:15,108 --> 01:34:17,318
We are here!
You are rescued!

942
01:34:17,402 --> 01:34:20,362
Charge!
Charge!

943
01:34:37,255 --> 01:34:39,673
No mercy!

944
01:34:52,103 --> 01:34:54,938
Elora!

945
01:34:55,023 --> 01:34:57,441
Willow!

946
01:35:03,281 --> 01:35:06,867
Elora's gone.
Willow.

947
01:35:06,951 --> 01:35:10,204
They've taken her.
There were too many of them.

948
01:35:10,330 --> 01:35:12,706
Willow.

949
01:35:15,126 --> 01:35:17,419
Can you ride?

950
01:35:20,006 --> 01:35:22,007
Let's ride.

951
01:35:34,437 --> 01:35:36,814
I have the child!

952
01:36:01,256 --> 01:36:03,382
We need towers and a battering ram!

953
01:36:03,466 --> 01:36:06,593
Break out the tents! Make camp!

954
01:36:06,678 --> 01:36:08,762
Make camp!

955
01:36:08,847 --> 01:36:10,681
We'll assault at first light.

956
01:36:24,529 --> 01:36:26,530
Where's Sorsha?

957
01:36:26,614 --> 01:36:29,241
She has turned against us,
Your Highness.

958
01:36:33,538 --> 01:36:36,999
Turned against me?

959
01:36:40,628 --> 01:36:42,754
Prepare for the ritual!

960
01:37:06,321 --> 01:37:09,781
This is not an army.

961
01:37:09,866 --> 01:37:11,783
Willow,

962
01:37:11,868 --> 01:37:14,536
quick, hide.

963
01:37:19,334 --> 01:37:22,419
Use the shelter chant. Protect yourself.

964
01:37:22,504 --> 01:37:24,546
- Why?
- Just do it.

965
01:37:30,094 --> 01:37:34,598
- We've come for Elora Danan.
- You dare to challenge me?

966
01:37:34,682 --> 01:37:36,975
You're not warriors.

967
01:37:37,060 --> 01:37:39,937
You're pigs!

968
01:37:40,063 --> 01:37:44,316
Toa thonna mondarr!

969
01:37:44,400 --> 01:37:48,195
Nocklith! Vohkbar!

970
01:37:55,828 --> 01:37:59,540
You're all pigs!

971
01:37:59,624 --> 01:38:03,210
Pigs!

972
01:38:07,340 --> 01:38:10,300
Avaggdu luatha bairn off haefermore.

973
01:38:18,268 --> 01:38:22,312
Sorsha!

974
01:38:22,397 --> 01:38:25,148
Mother, no!

975
01:38:26,317 --> 01:38:28,277
Kothon!

976
01:38:49,799 --> 01:38:57,431
Avaggdu luatha bairn off haefermore.

977
01:39:07,692 --> 01:39:09,735
Begin the ritual.

978
01:39:09,819 --> 01:39:12,654
This baby will not destroy me.

979
01:39:16,909 --> 01:39:20,037
Come, thunder!

980
01:39:20,121 --> 01:39:22,914
Come, lightning!

981
01:39:22,999 --> 01:39:27,419
Touch this altar with your powers.

982
01:39:48,358 --> 01:39:50,400
Aah!

983
01:39:50,485 --> 01:39:53,820
We've come all this way
and now Elora Danan's gonna die!

984
01:39:53,905 --> 01:39:56,948
No, we can still defeat Bavmorda.

985
01:39:57,033 --> 01:39:59,159
She's too powerful, Raziel.

986
01:39:59,243 --> 01:40:02,412
Transform me and I will destroy her.

987
01:40:07,210 --> 01:40:11,630
Elements of eternity, above and below.

988
01:40:11,714 --> 01:40:16,426
Balance of essence, fire beget snow.

989
01:40:17,929 --> 01:40:21,056
Locktwaar danalora luatha danu...
Willow,

990
01:40:21,182 --> 01:40:24,726
believe in the words.
Tuatha, tuatha, chnox danu.

991
01:40:24,852 --> 01:40:27,229
Concentrate.
Locktwaar danalora...

992
01:40:27,355 --> 01:40:31,274
luatha danu tuatha, tuatha.
Oh, no!

993
01:40:31,359 --> 01:40:34,194
Locktwaar danalora.

994
01:40:34,278 --> 01:40:37,364
Locktwaar danalora luatha danu...

995
01:40:37,490 --> 01:40:40,909
tuatha, tuatha, chnox danu.
Don't give up,

996
01:40:40,993 --> 01:40:43,662
Willow!

997
01:40:43,788 --> 01:40:48,250
Locktwaar danalora luatha danu...
Oh, Willow!

998
01:40:48,376 --> 01:40:52,546
tuatha, tuatha, chnox danu.

999
01:40:52,630 --> 01:40:56,758
Locktwaar danalora luatha danu tuath...

1000
01:40:56,843 --> 01:41:00,137
tuatha chnox... danu.

1001
01:41:12,900 --> 01:41:14,943
Raziel.

1002
01:41:24,537 --> 01:41:28,832
- Has it been so long?
- I'm sorry.

1003
01:41:30,710 --> 01:41:35,088
Willow, we have work to do.

1004
01:41:35,173 --> 01:41:38,091
Give me the wand.

1005
01:41:38,176 --> 01:41:41,970
We must undo Bavmorda's sorcery.

1006
01:41:44,015 --> 01:41:46,391
Let them in now.

1007
01:41:51,564 --> 01:41:55,150
Tuatha grin chnox, y foel famau.

1008
01:42:08,623 --> 01:42:11,666
Black fires forever kindled within,

1009
01:42:11,793 --> 01:42:16,797
let the second rite begin.

1010
01:42:31,562 --> 01:42:33,480
Quick, inside.

1011
01:42:33,564 --> 01:42:36,942
That won't reach the wall.
We can't get inside.

1012
01:42:37,026 --> 01:42:39,945
- Elora Danan will die.
- Unless we save her.

1013
01:42:40,071 --> 01:42:42,489
Bavmorda's too powerful.
No!

1014
01:42:42,573 --> 01:42:47,953
She cannot transform you again.
My spell is protecting this camp.

1015
01:42:48,037 --> 01:42:50,121
But can your magic
get us inside the fortress?

1016
01:42:52,333 --> 01:42:54,125
We can't do it.

1017
01:42:54,210 --> 01:42:59,005
Wait. Back home in my village,
we have a lot of gophers.

1018
01:42:59,131 --> 01:43:01,508
Willow, this is war, not agriculture.
I know, I know.

1019
01:43:01,592 --> 01:43:04,761
But I've an idea
how to get inside the castle.

1020
01:43:09,350 --> 01:43:12,394
Ocht veth bordak stira.

1021
01:43:12,478 --> 01:43:16,940
Ocht veth bordak stira.
Ocht veth bordak stira.

1022
01:43:17,066 --> 01:43:20,443
Ocht veth bordak stira.

1023
01:43:20,528 --> 01:43:23,363
Ocht veth bordak stira.

1024
01:43:23,447 --> 01:43:25,407
Come on, Madmartigan,
you and I are soldiers.

1025
01:43:25,491 --> 01:43:28,034
You and I know the peck's plan
will never work.

1026
01:43:28,119 --> 01:43:31,329
If the baby dies,
all hope for the future is lost.

1027
01:43:33,040 --> 01:43:35,625
I'm going to fight.

1028
01:43:38,963 --> 01:43:40,964
Me too.

1029
01:43:47,680 --> 01:43:51,266
All right, we've got to decide
who's gonna go and who's gonna stay.

1030
01:44:38,856 --> 01:44:41,191
Raziel.

1031
01:44:41,275 --> 01:44:46,196
Willow, all these years
I have waited to face Bavmorda.

1032
01:44:46,280 --> 01:44:49,532
It is you that has made this possible.

1033
01:44:49,617 --> 01:44:54,412
Whatever happens,
I shall always admire you.

1034
01:45:05,091 --> 01:45:07,425
Your children...

1035
01:45:07,510 --> 01:45:10,220
will come to remember this day.

1036
01:45:20,481 --> 01:45:23,775
We call upon you to surrender!

1037
01:45:25,486 --> 01:45:27,904
We are all-powerful sorcerers.

1038
01:45:27,989 --> 01:45:30,240
Give us the baby,

1039
01:45:30,324 --> 01:45:32,492
or we'll destroy you!

1040
01:45:38,708 --> 01:45:41,251
Kill them!

1041
01:46:00,146 --> 01:46:02,147
Patience, Willow.

1042
01:46:03,774 --> 01:46:05,734
Courage, Willow.

1043
01:46:16,370 --> 01:46:20,165
Whoa!

1044
01:46:21,792 --> 01:46:24,878
Back to the castle!

1045
01:46:49,445 --> 01:46:52,697
Ocht veth nockthirth bordak!

1046
01:46:52,823 --> 01:46:57,786
- Exile the child to the 13th night.

1047
01:47:04,418 --> 01:47:05,877
This way!

1048
01:47:45,251 --> 01:47:51,548
Nockthirth plankton
firth foreth forewar.

1049
01:47:51,632 --> 01:47:53,883
Ocht veth nock!

1050
01:47:53,968 --> 01:47:56,302
It's all right, Willow.

1051
01:47:56,387 --> 01:47:58,304
You don't have to go.

1052
01:47:58,389 --> 01:48:01,474
Light the 13th candle!

1053
01:48:15,948 --> 01:48:18,199
Raziel.

1054
01:48:18,284 --> 01:48:21,161
Mother!

1055
01:48:21,245 --> 01:48:23,705
I...

1056
01:48:23,789 --> 01:48:28,293
Traitor child. I must despise you now.

1057
01:48:58,324 --> 01:49:01,743
I won't let you kill that child.
Away!

1058
01:49:01,827 --> 01:49:04,078
Avaggdu...

1059
01:49:04,163 --> 01:49:06,789
strokt!

1060
01:49:23,265 --> 01:49:26,768
Your powers have gained
in strength, Raziel.

1061
01:49:26,852 --> 01:49:32,023
I have Cherlindrea's wand, Bavmorda.

1062
01:49:34,276 --> 01:49:38,112
Elora Danan will be queen.

1063
01:49:51,293 --> 01:49:55,630
Now you die!

1064
01:49:55,714 --> 01:50:00,009
Furrochk flarem!

1065
01:50:29,999 --> 01:50:32,333
Claideb cla...

1066
01:50:33,961 --> 01:50:39,340
Clai main! Lunano ocht!

1067
01:50:39,425 --> 01:50:42,302
Bachktu inno!

1068
01:50:47,141 --> 01:50:49,600
Wanu!

1069
01:51:51,497 --> 01:51:54,499
Yikes! Ohh!

1070
01:52:27,199 --> 01:52:30,827
Airk!

1071
01:52:33,372 --> 01:52:35,289
Airk.

1072
01:52:38,335 --> 01:52:40,503
Win this war for me.

1073
01:53:19,460 --> 01:53:22,879
Die!

1074
01:55:14,241 --> 01:55:16,659
Huh?

1075
01:55:16,743 --> 01:55:19,161
Beah!

1076
01:55:19,246 --> 01:55:23,583
Bring back that child, peck.

1077
01:55:27,754 --> 01:55:30,715
Who are you?

1078
01:55:32,551 --> 01:55:34,677
I'm Willow Ufgood.

1079
01:55:40,017 --> 01:55:42,101
I'm a great sorcerer.

1080
01:55:42,185 --> 01:55:45,104
Greater than Raziel.

1081
01:55:45,188 --> 01:55:48,399
Greater than you even.

1082
01:55:49,401 --> 01:55:51,402
I'm the greatest sorcerer!

1083
01:56:10,881 --> 01:56:14,342
Is that the extent
of your powers, little one?

1084
01:56:18,430 --> 01:56:22,975
Now you will watch me draw
upon the power of the universe...

1085
01:56:23,060 --> 01:56:25,394
to send that child into the netherworld.

1086
01:56:25,479 --> 01:56:27,188
Now place it on the altar!

1087
01:56:38,075 --> 01:56:40,576
No!

1088
01:56:40,661 --> 01:56:42,620
No?

1089
01:56:42,704 --> 01:56:45,331
You stupid hag!

1090
01:56:45,415 --> 01:56:48,876
With my magic, I'll send her into the...

1091
01:56:48,960 --> 01:56:51,045
Into a...

1092
01:56:51,129 --> 01:56:53,923
You're no sorcerer.

1093
01:56:54,049 --> 01:56:58,344
Into a realm where evil cannot touch her.
Impossible!

1094
01:56:58,428 --> 01:57:02,640
- There's no such place!
- Helgafel swath ben helgafel.

1095
01:57:02,724 --> 01:57:08,145
You're a fool! I shall destroy you
and the child with you.

1096
01:57:08,271 --> 01:57:11,107
You're a fool! Nockmaar-
Bairn off danu famoww.

1097
01:57:11,191 --> 01:57:13,150
Good-bye, Elora.

1098
01:57:13,235 --> 01:57:16,320
Bohi bakstiy.

1099
01:57:16,405 --> 01:57:20,366
Helgafel!

1100
01:57:24,371 --> 01:57:29,458
Im... possible!

1101
01:57:33,505 --> 01:57:35,631
You...

1102
01:58:17,257 --> 01:58:19,467
Willow, where's the baby?

1103
01:58:21,011 --> 01:58:24,847
It was just my old disappearing-pig trick.

1104
01:58:28,727 --> 01:58:30,978
Oh, well done!

1105
01:58:31,062 --> 01:58:32,980
Oh.

1106
01:58:33,857 --> 01:58:37,109
Willow Ufgood,
receive this book of magic.

1107
01:58:37,194 --> 01:58:42,364
You are on your way
to becoming a great sorcerer.

1108
01:58:44,576 --> 01:58:47,411
- Willow the Sorcerer!
- You make us proud!

1109
01:58:52,959 --> 01:58:55,753
Good-bye, Elora Danan.

1110
01:59:02,719 --> 01:59:04,595
Hey.

1111
01:59:14,481 --> 01:59:16,607
Good-bye, Willow!

1112
01:59:16,691 --> 01:59:20,069
Farewell!
Eh?

1113
01:59:33,917 --> 01:59:36,418
Willow! Willow!
Hello, Regan. Hello.

1114
01:59:36,503 --> 01:59:39,213
Willow's back! Willow's back!

1115
01:59:39,297 --> 01:59:42,132
Willow! Willow!

1116
01:59:42,217 --> 01:59:45,553
Willow! Willow Ufgood!

1117
01:59:47,180 --> 01:59:50,766
- Willow!
- Hey, Meegosh!

1118
02:00:05,031 --> 02:00:07,700
It's a bird! He made a bird!

1119
02:00:07,784 --> 02:00:10,160
Aaaaaagh!

1120
02:00:17,502 --> 02:00:20,838
Kiaya!

1121
02:00:22,173 --> 02:00:25,634
- Willow?
- Kiaya.

1122
02:00:25,719 --> 02:00:28,512
Willow! Willow!

1123
02:00:28,597 --> 02:00:31,807
Kiaya!

1124
02:00:31,892 --> 02:00:34,310
- Dada! Dada!
- Dada, I missed you!

1125
02:00:34,394 --> 02:00:37,688
Oh, I missed you.
