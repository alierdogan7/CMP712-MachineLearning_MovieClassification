the western devil has no cure.

We stopped them...

our own way.

What?

1478
01:03:08,521 --> 01:03:12,424
See, they only wanted to spread
it in the United States,

1479
01:03:12,492 --> 01:03:16,295
but in order to fulfill
the prophecy in Dave's bible,

01:03:16,363 --> 01:03:20,099
We must wipe out
the entire planet.

Unfortunately, the desperate
nature of our situation

1510

suggests that we may
need another of us

to embrace martyrdom as we bring
our fight to the Infidels.

You can make them work

crystal meth in the water.

Now, some of you may be asking,
"isn't crystal meth illegal?"

01:05:55,155 --> 01:05:56,655
Technically, yes,

1533
01:05:56,723 --> 01:05:59,825
but the U.S. Air force uses it
to fuel their pilots

1534

when they're on night missions
over Afghanistan.

1535
01:06:02,028 --> 01:06:05,831
So it can't be that illegal
if the U.S. Air force uses it.

So...what now?
