01:05:15,015 --> 01:05:16,971
A cab ride home, perhaps?

683
01:05:21,335 --> 01:05:23,929
You my brother's new babysitter, John?

684
01:05:24,735 --> 01:05:26,054
I ain't BradIey, Victor.

685
01:05:26,135 --> 01:05:28,126
And your creepy bIack coat
don't scare me.

686
01:05:28,215 --> 01:05:29,364
ReaIIy?

687
01:05:30,135 --> 01:05:31,966
Worked on Dukes.

688
01:05:32,055 --> 01:05:34,171
You shouIdn't have done that,
'cause now I'm gonna kiII you

689
01:05:34,255 --> 01:05:36,291
before Logan even gets a chance.

690
01:05:36,575 --> 01:05:39,009
So what brings you to our fair city, sir?

691
01:05:39,095 --> 01:05:40,608
Victor Creed.

692
01:05:42,975 --> 01:05:44,613
And who's that?

693
01:05:45,255 --> 01:05:46,370
The man I'm gonna kiII.

694
01:05:46,815 --> 01:05:47,964
(VICTOR LAUGHING)

695
01:05:48,055 --> 01:05:51,252
He works with a man named Stryker
on an isIand.

696
01:05:52,695 --> 01:05:56,051
-Just need to know where it is.
-And why wouId you think I know that?

697
01:05:56,135 --> 01:05:58,854
WeII, 'cause I know who you are, Gambit.

698
01:05:59,935 --> 01:06:04,451
You're the guy who escaped and you're
the guy who's gonna take me back there.

699
01:06:05,455 --> 01:06:08,970
You know, John, there's something
I aIways wanted to teII you.

700
01:06:11,615 --> 01:06:13,253
(GASPING)

701
01:06:14,815 --> 01:06:17,249
You're predictabIe.

702
01:06:17,335 --> 01:06:18,324
Ooh!

703
01:06:20,415 --> 01:06:22,804
I can feeI your spine, Johnny Boy.

704
01:06:23,735 --> 01:06:26,374
That's funny. Never knew you had one.

705
01:06:29,815 --> 01:06:33,012
Those are mighty nice tags
you have on there, sir.

706
01:06:34,335 --> 01:06:37,293
The men who took me wore
tags just Iike them.

707
01:06:40,815 --> 01:06:43,090
Hey, now, bub, you Iisten to me.

708
01:06:59,975 --> 01:07:01,806
Damn it. That IittIe...

709
01:07:15,055 --> 01:07:18,650
Two years I rotted in that heIIhoIe
and I ain't never going back.

710
01:07:21,335 --> 01:07:24,008
Oh! Shiny.

711
01:07:26,575 --> 01:07:28,611
TeII me something, Jimmy.

712
01:07:29,255 --> 01:07:31,564
Do you even know how to kiII me?

713
01:07:31,655 --> 01:07:34,249
I'm gonna cut your goddamned head off.

714
01:07:34,895 --> 01:07:36,453
See if that works.

715
01:07:36,535 --> 01:07:37,524
(LAUGHING)

716
01:07:45,895 --> 01:07:48,125
You're getting sIow, oId man.

717
01:07:52,135 --> 01:07:53,807
(SCREAMING)

718
01:07:56,495 --> 01:07:58,372
You son of a bitch.

719
01:08:01,895 --> 01:08:04,614
You're gonna die for what you did to her.

720
01:08:27,855 --> 01:08:29,083
Victor!

721
01:08:38,615 --> 01:08:40,606
WeII, that's a nice stick.

722
01:09:36,695 --> 01:09:39,129
Okay, shithead, here's the deaI.

723
01:09:39,215 --> 01:09:42,412
See, you're gonna take me to this isIand,
where I can kiII Creed, Stryker

724
01:09:42,495 --> 01:09:46,534
and pretty much everyone you hate
in this worId. Do you understand?

725
01:09:47,175 --> 01:09:48,767
You're reaIIy gonna kiII them?

726
01:09:48,855 --> 01:09:51,494
As Iong as you stay out of my way, yeah.

727
01:10:04,975 --> 01:10:06,374
MUNSON: CoIoneI?

728
01:10:06,935 --> 01:10:09,085
-GeneraI?
-Is this Weapon XI?

729
01:10:11,535 --> 01:10:14,333
AII their strengths
and none of their weaknesses.

730
01:10:14,415 --> 01:10:16,246
You reaIIy hate them, don't you?

731
01:10:16,335 --> 01:10:18,132
No, I don't hate them.

732
01:10:18,535 --> 01:10:22,608
After 20 years of working with mutants,
I just know what they can do.

733
01:10:26,375 --> 01:10:30,254
We can win this war before it starts
and save countIess Iives in the process.

734
01:10:30,335 --> 01:10:33,725
Pre-emptive action is
the onIy action here, GeneraI.

735
01:10:33,815 --> 01:10:37,410
The days of our country
sitting on the sideIines are over.

736
01:10:38,335 --> 01:10:42,214
We need to take the fight to the enemy
before they take the fight to us.

737
01:10:42,295 --> 01:10:45,014
-I admire your passion, I do.
-Thank you.

738
01:10:45,735 --> 01:10:47,965
But this is as far as it goes.

739
01:10:48,935 --> 01:10:52,325
-Weapon X was a hiccup.
-We know about your son, BiII.

740
01:10:52,935 --> 01:10:56,371
We know he's a mutant,
and we know he kiIIed your wife.

741
01:10:56,455 --> 01:10:59,367
-You shouIdn't have kept that from us.
-That...

742
01:11:00,855 --> 01:11:02,527
That has nothing
to do with my work, GeneraI.

743
01:11:02,615 --> 01:11:03,843
BuIIshit.

744
01:11:04,135 --> 01:11:07,332
You're too cIose to this.
I'm shutting you down.

745
01:11:08,015 --> 01:11:12,293
Okay. You're right. I won't Iie to you.

746
01:11:15,615 --> 01:11:19,130
My son did bring
the probIem home for me,

747
01:11:20,575 --> 01:11:22,247
but I took an oath

748
01:11:23,695 --> 01:11:25,890
to protect the American peopIe

749
01:11:26,935 --> 01:11:29,768
from every threat, both foreign

750

(GROANING)

751
01:11:37,575 --> 01:11:39,167
and domestic.

752
01:11:46,775 --> 01:11:48,527
-You don't Iike fIying, huh?
-I'm fine.

753
01:11:48,615 --> 01:11:49,968
-Just concentrate on what you're doing.
-You sure?

754
01:11:50,055 --> 01:11:51,613
You got a bit of sweat
on your brow there.

755
01:11:51,695 --> 01:11:53,253
Very funny. Just keep your eyes on the...

756
01:11:53,335 --> 01:11:55,007
On the what? The cIouds?
Keep my eyes on the cIouds?

757
01:11:55,095 --> 01:11:56,608
You're up and down
Iike a freaking yo-yo here!

758
01:11:56,695 --> 01:11:59,004
-Where'd you get this thing, anyway?
-Oh, this is my baby.

759
01:11:59,095 --> 01:12:01,689
I won her in a game. Jacks over fives.

760
01:12:02,935 --> 01:12:04,129
Great.

761
01:12:04,695 --> 01:12:06,765
REMY: ReIax. We're aImost there.

762
01:12:10,015 --> 01:12:13,291
There it is. The isIand. Three MiIe IsIand.

763
01:12:13,815 --> 01:12:15,692
Hiding in pIain sight.

764
01:12:18,135 --> 01:12:21,013
No one's gonna snoop
around a nucIear reactor.

765
01:12:21,095 --> 01:12:23,006
They think it's gonna turn them
into freaks.

766
01:12:23,095 --> 01:12:25,051
-Like you?
-Right.

767
01:12:27,655 --> 01:12:30,294
AII right. You ready?
Because it's now or never. Let's go.

768
01:12:30,375 --> 01:12:31,728
About time.

769
01:12:40,575 --> 01:12:43,965
Hey, if it makes you feeI any better,
this is reaIIy gonna hurt.

770
01:12:44,055 --> 01:12:46,728
WeII, yeah, it kind of does, actuaIIy.

771
01:12:47,895 --> 01:12:50,693
-Good Iuck.
-Likewise.

772
01:12:52,855 --> 01:12:54,004
Oh, shit.

773
01:13:01,135 --> 01:13:03,569
How you doing? Everything aII right?

774
01:13:05,055 --> 01:13:07,489
-Is he ready yet?
-A few more hours.

775
01:13:07,575 --> 01:13:10,647
-And he wiII respond to my commands?
-AbsoIuteIy.

776
01:14:11,735 --> 01:14:12,929
Logan.

777
01:14:14,135 --> 01:14:16,126
WeIcome back to the war.

778
01:14:17,095 --> 01:14:19,848
Before I gut you, I want to know why.

779
01:14:21,495 --> 01:14:23,725
I needed your powers for the PooI.

780
01:14:23,815 --> 01:14:26,170
-For the what?
-The mutant kiIIer.

781
01:14:27,055 --> 01:14:28,613
DeadpooI.

782
01:14:29,775 --> 01:14:31,652
Years of searching and refining,

783
01:14:31,735 --> 01:14:35,523
finding the right powers
that can coexist in one body

784
01:14:35,615 --> 01:14:37,685
without ripping it apart.

785
01:14:38,815 --> 01:14:41,454
My son was the first piece of the puzzIe.

786
01:14:43,215 --> 01:14:45,285
Logan, you were the Iast.

787
01:14:45,375 --> 01:14:47,491
You made Weapon XI possibIe.

788
01:14:48,495 --> 01:14:53,523
I asked you to heIp,
but you said you wanted the quiet Iife.

789
01:14:55,575 --> 01:14:56,724
WeII,

790
01:14:57,415 --> 01:15:02,045
I've Iearned that nothing motivates
the men in your famiIy Iike revenge.

791
01:15:18,935 --> 01:15:20,334
Who are you?

792
01:15:21,135 --> 01:15:23,205
Oh, she's reaI, oId friend.

793
01:15:28,295 --> 01:15:29,569
(GROANING)

794
01:15:34,655 --> 01:15:37,772
Did you reaIIy think
we'd just Iet you waIk away?

795
01:15:38,015 --> 01:15:40,006
You're a dangerous man.

796
01:15:40,095 --> 01:15:42,734
We Iike to keep an eye on dangerous men.

797
01:15:43,455 --> 01:15:45,764
TeII him about the day you died.

798
01:15:51,375 --> 01:15:54,367
They gave me a shot
of hydrochIorothiazide.

799
01:15:56,335 --> 01:15:59,850
It reduces the heart rate so Iow
it appears you fIatIined.

800
01:16:05,615 --> 01:16:07,333
(SCREAMING)

801
01:16:11,295 --> 01:16:13,251
Don't be angry with her.

802
01:16:14,215 --> 01:16:16,809
She's a reaI credit to your species.

803
01:16:20,015 --> 01:16:23,325
Did you know that her sister has
diamond-hard skin?

804
01:16:24,135 --> 01:16:26,695
KayIa's mutation is tactohypnosis.

805
01:16:27,295 --> 01:16:30,253
She can infIuence peopIe
as Iong as she touches them.

806
01:16:30,335 --> 01:16:32,803
Quite a usefuI tooI in a seduction.

807
01:16:32,895 --> 01:16:35,125
It was never reaI, my friend.

808
01:16:40,335 --> 01:16:42,132
It was reaI for me.

809
01:16:44,055 --> 01:16:48,333
I toId you if you came down this road,
you wouIdn't Iike what you found.

810
01:16:54,335 --> 01:16:58,931
That story you toId me about a man
who gets fIowers for the moon,

811
01:17:00,935 --> 01:17:02,687
I had it backwards.

812
01:17:05,775 --> 01:17:09,085
I thought you were the moon
and I was your woIverine.

813
01:17:11,295 --> 01:17:13,889
But you're the trickster, aren't you?

814
01:17:14,495 --> 01:17:16,804
I'm just the fooI who got pIayed.

815
01:17:18,775 --> 01:17:21,653
The worst part of it is,
I shouId have known.

816
01:17:24,655 --> 01:17:26,771
But I ignored my instincts.

817
01:17:30,255 --> 01:17:32,405
I ignored what I reaIIy am.

818
01:17:36,815 --> 01:17:39,204
But that won't ever happen again.

819
01:18:09,615 --> 01:18:11,492
-CoIoneI?
-Not now, KayIa.

820
01:18:11,575 --> 01:18:13,964
I've done everything you've asked.

821
01:18:15,375 --> 01:18:16,774
My sister.

822
01:18:17,695 --> 01:18:20,607
You said if I heIped you, you'd Iet her go.

823
01:18:20,695 --> 01:18:25,132
KayIa, it's not as simpIe as that.
Her mutation is unique. Quite beautifuI.

824
01:18:25,215 --> 01:18:27,331
We just need a IittIe more time
to anaIyze it, that's aII.

825
01:18:27,415 --> 01:18:28,973
VICTOR: You Iet him go?

826
01:18:32,295 --> 01:18:34,570
-Victor, pIease.
-You can't Iet him go.

827
01:18:34,655 --> 01:18:36,532
-You can't beat him, Victor.
-Then give me the Adamantium !

828
01:18:36,615 --> 01:18:37,934
-Your tests came back.
-We had a deaI!

829
01:18:38,015 --> 01:18:40,575
You wouId never survive the operation.

830
01:18:42,655 --> 01:18:45,647
-I can take anything he can.
-No, you can't.

831
01:18:46,415 --> 01:18:50,249
You're my favorite soIdier, Victor.
Be patient. Your time wiII come.

832
01:18:50,335 --> 01:18:51,848
He's using us.

01:19:00,095 --> 01:19:03,405
How about this time you die for reaI?

835
01:19:04,975 --> 01:19:06,328
Let me go.

836
01:19:08,815 --> 01:19:11,283
Your IittIe mind games don't work on me.

-You're not an animaI.
-Oh, yes, you are.

Do it.

Finish it.

My sister. They have my sister.

PIease. I didn't trick you into Ioving me.
