It is estimated that

Baby, it's great to hear from you!
But what time is it over there?

partying too much, are you?

348

You promised me you'd
look after yourself.

out of the blue like this.

eyes and a broken tail.

Sweetie, you can't possibly remember that.
You were barely a year old.

500 grams.

384
00:35:09,919 --> 00:35:13,699
And how long will it take my body
to eliminate the rest of it?

know what it is. May I?

a synthetic version of it.

they'd succeeded.

What I'm saying is that your
theory is not a theory.

I absorbed a large quantity
of synthetic C.P.H.4.

"One" is their unit of measure.

But it's not. All social systems we've
put into place are a mere sketch.

One plus one equals two.
That's all we've learned.

never equaled two.
