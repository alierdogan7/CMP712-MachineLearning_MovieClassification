365
00:34:52,258 --> 00:34:54,177
The game's not finished.

366
00:35:10,234 --> 00:35:13,112
Is this where the world ends,
or is there more?

367
00:35:13,738 --> 00:35:16,324
My queen, the South
cannot be conquered.

368
00:35:16,491 --> 00:35:18,826
Snow White's lands are too vast,
her armies are too...

369
00:35:18,910 --> 00:35:21,454
Did you know
that Eric was alive?

370
00:35:22,872 --> 00:35:24,207
Did you?

371
00:35:26,209 --> 00:35:27,210
How?

372
00:35:27,293 --> 00:35:28,294
I swear to you.

That's all right.

374
00:35:30,588 --> 00:35:32,757
I prefer it this way.

375
00:35:32,924 --> 00:35:35,218
There's something
that he seeks.

376
00:35:36,385 --> 00:35:38,262
I want it.

377
00:35:38,971 --> 00:35:40,640
My sister's mirror.

378
00:35:41,182 --> 00:35:42,934
It holds great power.

379
00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:45,895
And with it at my command,
I can do great things.

380
00:35:46,729 --> 00:35:49,524
I will free every child.

381
00:35:49,607 --> 00:35:51,526
I will save them all.

382
00:35:51,609 --> 00:35:52,944
As I saved you.

383
00:35:54,111 --> 00:35:56,030
And my army
of Huntsmen will grow

384
00:35:56,113 --> 00:35:58,407
until nothing will
stand in its path.

385
00:35:59,575 --> 00:36:01,994
So, you see,
the game is not finished.

386
00:36:05,540 --> 00:36:07,124
Prepare the Huntsmen.

387
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:09,961
Oh.

388
00:36:10,836 --> 00:36:12,171
Oh. Huntsman.

389
00:36:12,463 --> 00:36:13,464
Hmm?

390
00:36:14,340 --> 00:36:16,300
What?
How much further?

391
00:36:17,176 --> 00:36:18,261
How much further?

392
00:36:18,719 --> 00:36:21,305
What? To the place I'm looking for
that I don't know where it is?

393
00:36:21,389 --> 00:36:22,431
It's hard to say.

394
00:36:23,057 --> 00:36:25,560
This one's had a strop on
since we left.

395
00:36:45,621 --> 00:36:46,831
They came through here.

396
00:36:46,914 --> 00:36:48,040
Well, obviously.

397
00:36:48,124 --> 00:36:49,875
This takes us to
the northern road.

398
00:36:49,959 --> 00:36:50,959
Leads direct
to Sanctuary.

399
00:36:51,419 --> 00:36:53,045
Don't need to be
a Huntsman to know that.

400
00:36:53,963 --> 00:36:56,132
Hey, Nion,
who am I?

401
00:36:56,924 --> 00:36:58,342
Ooh.

402
00:36:58,426 --> 00:37:02,013
I'm talking to the dirt.
I hear it speak to me.

403
00:37:02,305 --> 00:37:03,931
He's actually quite
good at this, Gryff.

He's a buffoon.

405

Well...
We ride north.

406
00:37:08,060 --> 00:37:10,062
Actually,
they headed west.

407
00:37:11,105 --> 00:37:13,733
The northern road cuts through a plain.
Nowhere to take cover.

408
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:17,153
The western road
runs next to a forest.

409
00:37:17,236 --> 00:37:18,676
That's where they
would've made camp.

410
00:37:18,738 --> 00:37:20,239
That's where
we're going to find them.

411
00:37:20,406 --> 00:37:22,616
Obviously...
(SHUSHING)

412
00:37:23,075 --> 00:37:25,745
The dirt is talking to me again.
What's it saying?

413
00:37:25,911 --> 00:37:28,622
He's saying the
mouthy one's an idiot

414
00:37:28,706 --> 00:37:31,667
who wouldn't last a day on his own,
and should go home.

415
00:37:31,751 --> 00:37:32,752

I'm not going home
till I get my reward.

going to find out here is death.

Dramatic, yeah,
unless it's true,

420
00:37:44,722 --> 00:37:47,082
and then we should consider it
an accurate warning, I think.

of Freya of the Frost.

They could still be around.

I tied you up.

541
00:47:19,713 --> 00:47:21,423
She his wife
or something?

542
00:47:21,506 --> 00:47:23,342
No. Can't be.
His wife's dead.

543
00:47:24,384 --> 00:47:25,719
Dead?

544
00:47:26,970 --> 00:47:29,056
Is that what
you told everyone?

545
00:47:29,932 --> 00:47:33,518
You poor,
heartbroken widower.

546
00:47:34,186 --> 00:47:37,439
That story must've wet the
eyes of many a young lass.

547
00:47:38,440 --> 00:47:40,317
Maybe more
than their eyes.

548
00:47:41,568 --> 00:47:43,779
No, no...
No, you're dead.

549
00:47:43,862 --> 00:47:45,697
I saw you die.

550
00:47:46,490 --> 00:47:49,034
This is not real.
This is not happening.

551
00:47:49,826 --> 00:47:51,745
You're a ghost.
(CHUCKLES)

552
00:47:51,995 --> 00:47:53,163
Or else I'm...

553
00:47:54,164 --> 00:47:56,667
Or else I'm dead.

554
00:47:57,042 --> 00:47:58,460
Am I not alive?

555
00:47:58,627 --> 00:47:59,920
You're alive.

556
00:48:00,128 --> 00:48:01,463
Although,
you should be dead.

557
00:48:01,546 --> 00:48:03,340
You got hit on
the head like, six...

558
00:48:03,423 --> 00:48:04,901
What do you think, six or seven?
Seven.

559
00:48:04,925 --> 00:48:06,176
Seven times. A lot.

560
00:48:06,969 --> 00:48:09,096
So this is...
Real.

561
00:48:10,472 --> 00:48:11,515
Very.

562
00:48:16,937 --> 00:48:19,022
Did you think
I'd forget?

563
00:48:21,817 --> 00:48:23,860
Did you think
I'd forgive?

564
00:48:26,196 --> 00:48:28,073
Stand or fall,
you said.

565
00:48:28,824 --> 00:48:31,535
You'd never leave
my side, you said.

566
00:48:32,995 --> 00:48:34,371
You swore it.

567
00:48:37,499 --> 00:48:39,543
And then you fled.

568
00:48:39,626 --> 00:48:42,045
I see you fight,
and I see you run.

569
00:49:08,989 --> 00:49:11,658
No, Sara.
That's not what happened.

570
00:49:11,783 --> 00:49:14,244
I saw Tull kill you.

571
00:49:14,411 --> 00:49:16,806
I saw him kill you, with my own eyes.
I would never leave you.

572
00:49:16,830 --> 00:49:19,499
But I saw you leave me,
with my own eyes.

573
00:49:20,083 --> 00:49:22,794
And you, of all people,
should know

574
00:49:22,878 --> 00:49:25,213
Tull could
never kill me.

575
00:49:25,380 --> 00:49:26,673
Sara.

576
00:49:26,757 --> 00:49:28,383
Don't.
I swear to you.

577
00:49:28,550 --> 00:49:30,093
She put me
in her dungeon.

578
00:49:30,260 --> 00:49:32,429
For seven years.

579
00:49:32,512 --> 00:49:36,016
And when I finally escaped,
I swore I'd find you.

580
00:49:36,183 --> 00:49:38,101
It's taken me a long time.

581
00:49:40,854 --> 00:49:42,731
But here we are.

582
00:49:44,649 --> 00:49:45,984
Husband

583
00:49:46,651 --> 00:49:47,694
and wife.

584
00:49:48,862 --> 00:49:52,866
You honestly believe this?
That I'd abandon you?

585
00:49:54,201 --> 00:49:55,202
Aye.

586
00:49:55,911 --> 00:49:56,953
(GRUNTING)

587
00:50:00,665 --> 00:50:03,293
You still forget
your balance.

(CHUCKLING)

589
00:50:08,340 --> 00:50:09,466
She's got another knife.

590
00:50:10,133 --> 00:50:12,177
Yeah. Yeah,
I probably should have said something.

591
00:50:12,385 --> 00:50:13,386
Mmm-hmm.

592
00:50:13,595 --> 00:50:18,141
She's got two more
little ones in her left boot.

593
00:50:19,684 --> 00:50:21,311
It's no longer important.

594
00:50:22,813 --> 00:50:26,316
If your face is the last
thing that I'm meant to see,

595
00:50:26,483 --> 00:50:28,193
then I'm grateful.

596
00:50:31,655 --> 00:50:33,448
It should be
the last thing you see.

597
00:50:33,657 --> 00:50:34,658
(GROANS)

598
00:50:34,783 --> 00:50:35,784
Oh!

599
00:50:39,037 --> 00:50:40,288
GRYFF:
I don't like her.

600
00:50:41,665 --> 00:50:42,850
I don't like her
one little bit.

(WHISPERS) No fire.

00:51:20,579 --> 00:51:21,997
No fire!

(CHUCKLES)

609
00:52:07,918 --> 00:52:11,213
So, what happens
if Freya gets this mirror?

610
00:52:13,381 --> 00:52:14,883
Don't you think
that you and me

611
00:52:14,966 --> 00:52:17,636
have other things
to discuss, like us?

612
00:52:17,802 --> 00:52:18,803
No.

613
00:52:19,763 --> 00:52:21,097
What happens?

614
00:52:23,934 --> 00:52:25,602
She'd be unstoppable.

615
00:52:30,690 --> 00:52:31,691
(WHISTLES)

616
00:52:32,776 --> 00:52:33,860
Where's my horse?

617
00:52:33,985 --> 00:52:35,320
I sent it off.

618
00:52:36,071 --> 00:52:37,447
What did you
do that for?

619
00:52:37,530 --> 00:52:39,407
No horses,
no tracks.

620
00:52:39,491 --> 00:52:41,660
We keep off the road,
out of sight.

621
00:52:42,077 --> 00:52:44,496
(CHUCKLES) So you're
coming with me, then?

622
00:52:44,579 --> 00:52:46,998
No, you're coming with me.

623
00:52:47,499 --> 00:52:50,085
Yeah, whatever you
need to tell yourself, that's fine.

624
00:52:50,168 --> 00:52:53,546
From what I can see, your wee band
won't do too well without me.

625
00:52:53,838 --> 00:52:55,090
Huh?
No...

626
00:52:55,173 --> 00:52:59,052
SARA: Whatever power this mirror contains,
I'll not let Freya wield it.

627
00:52:59,135 --> 00:53:01,805
We'll find it,
and we'll bring it to the Sanctuary.

628
00:53:02,347 --> 00:53:04,099
And then you and I

629
00:53:04,224 --> 00:53:06,059
will part forever.

630
00:53:07,060 --> 00:53:08,228
Now.

631
00:53:08,853 --> 00:53:10,438
Tell me about this.

632
00:53:14,317 --> 00:53:16,403
What do you think?
About what?

633
00:53:16,861 --> 00:53:18,989
The woman.
Do you trust her?

634
00:53:19,072 --> 00:53:22,575
Well, I mean, I don't think
we've got much of a choice.

635
00:53:23,076 --> 00:53:25,412
Besides, she's pretty
good in a scrap.

636
00:53:25,578 --> 00:53:28,123
I imagine that would come
in handy before too long.

637
00:53:28,206 --> 00:53:30,417
We'll hit Callan Crossing
by nightfall.

638
00:53:30,500 --> 00:53:32,700
There's a market there.
They might have sold the Mirror.

639
00:53:32,836 --> 00:53:35,380
Tracking never was one
of your strengths, was it?

640
00:53:35,463 --> 00:53:38,049
I cannae wait to find out
what yours is.

641
00:53:38,133 --> 00:53:39,801
If an enemy uses
diamonds for arrows,

642
00:53:39,884 --> 00:53:42,053
I doubt they need to sell
the Mirror for money.

643
00:53:42,137 --> 00:53:44,097
Well, if you don't like my plan,
you can piss off.

644
00:53:44,139 --> 00:53:46,141
That is charming!

645
00:53:46,474 --> 00:53:48,893
And you can piss off, too,
as you so eloquently put it,

646
00:53:48,977 --> 00:53:50,645
but that's not
gonna get rid of me.

647
00:53:51,479 --> 00:53:52,939
You're still my wife.

648
00:53:56,317 --> 00:53:58,862
Look, we were deceived.

649
00:53:59,404 --> 00:54:01,156
The ice wall that
Freya put between us,

650
00:54:01,239 --> 00:54:03,324
she showed us
what she wanted us to see.

651
00:54:06,327 --> 00:54:07,370
Wait.

652
00:54:08,038 --> 00:54:09,497
And what if I'm right?

653
00:54:10,999 --> 00:54:12,417
Do we not deserve
that chance?

654
00:54:13,334 --> 00:54:15,170
It wouldn't matter.

655
00:54:15,295 --> 00:54:16,337
You'd leave again.

656
00:54:17,380 --> 00:54:19,716
We blind ourselves to the
truth because we're weak,

657
00:54:19,799 --> 00:54:21,509
because we hope.

658
00:54:21,593 --> 00:54:23,386
But there's
no hope for love.

659
00:54:24,679 --> 00:54:26,347
Love ends in betrayal.

660
00:54:27,348 --> 00:54:29,017

00:54:31,603 --> 00:54:34,064

With you and your

1080
01:27:55,104 --> 01:27:57,815
I will regain
my kingdom once more.

1082
01:28:01,611 --> 01:28:04,030

1084
01:28:07,408 --> 01:28:10,036
She will beg for mercy.

1085
01:28:11,746 --> 01:28:14,415
And then I'll tear
her heart out.

1086
01:28:21,130 --> 01:28:23,925
MRS. BROMWYN: Oh, that's a bit
bigger than I imagined.

1087
01:28:24,801 --> 01:28:26,385

So what's the plan?

1088
01:28:29,305 --> 01:28:30,348
You have got a plan?

1089
01:28:30,973 --> 01:28:32,100
Aye.

1090
01:28:32,642 --> 01:28:33,684
Is it any good?

1091
01:28:34,352 --> 01:28:35,394
No.

1092
01:28:36,145 --> 01:28:37,271
But it's simple.

1093
01:28:37,855 --> 01:28:40,900
Freya will be in her sanctum,
below the steeple.

1094
01:28:40,983 --> 01:28:44,362
I'll make my way down from the top,
find her, and kill her.

1095
01:28:44,570 --> 01:28:46,155
What about
Nion and Doreena?

1096
01:28:46,322 --> 01:28:49,158
I've got someone on the inside
who's gonna help me find them.

1097
01:28:49,742 --> 01:28:50,952
Who?
You.

1098
01:28:53,246 --> 01:28:55,998
You have given
my Huntsmen new orders.

1099
01:28:57,750 --> 01:28:59,001
Better orders.

1100
01:29:00,461 --> 01:29:02,964
We will attack tomorrow
in two waves.

1101
01:29:03,047 --> 01:29:04,340
Flanking maneuver.

1102
01:29:04,423 --> 01:29:06,342
I presumed
you would agree.

1103
01:29:06,509 --> 01:29:08,803
It's a far
superior tactic.

1104
01:29:08,970 --> 01:29:10,555
This is my kingdom.

1105
01:29:10,721 --> 01:29:13,474
Did you say something?
This is my kingdom!

1106
01:29:14,976 --> 01:29:16,769
Of course it is.

1107
01:29:18,271 --> 01:29:20,231
And it always will be.

1108
01:29:21,315 --> 01:29:24,277
I would never question
my sister's rule.

1109
01:29:25,278 --> 01:29:28,197
But beyond these walls

1110
01:29:29,824 --> 01:29:31,367

It's not my sister's fault,
