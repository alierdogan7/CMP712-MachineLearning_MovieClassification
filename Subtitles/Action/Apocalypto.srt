Thank you.

13
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:55,292
This liver for Curl Nose.

00:03:55,635 --> 00:03:57,364
[Curl Nose] Thank you.

Thank you.

And for you Blunted...

19
00:04:13,453 --> 00:04:15,045
...the balls.

20
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:19,484
Not this again.

21
00:04:19,926 --> 00:04:20,915
I'm helping you.

22
00:04:21,127 --> 00:04:22,253
Then you eat them!

23
00:04:22,428 --> 00:04:24,760
I don't need them.
Neither do the rest of the fellows.

24
00:04:24,864 --> 00:04:25,888
Do you fellows?

25
00:04:25,965 --> 00:04:26,727
[all] No.

26
00:04:26,799 --> 00:04:27,766
Of course not!

27
00:04:27,834 --> 00:04:29,096
Sometimes!

28
00:04:29,335 --> 00:04:30,131
What do you think?

29
00:04:30,503 --> 00:04:31,299
No!

30
00:04:31,371 --> 00:04:32,269
No, no!

31
00:04:32,872 --> 00:04:34,635
But how many times does it take?

32
00:04:34,874 --> 00:04:37,502
I have eight older sisters
and one brother.

33
00:04:37,844 --> 00:04:41,245
Father took tapir balls all ten times.

34
00:05:21,821 --> 00:05:23,186
Shall I tell him?

35
00:05:25,224 --> 00:05:27,522
I'm sorry. The balls are useless.

36
00:05:29,762 --> 00:05:30,956
You've never had them?

37
00:05:31,264 --> 00:05:33,732
Couldn't tell you what they taste like.

38
00:05:34,734 --> 00:05:35,826
None of you?

39
00:05:37,837 --> 00:05:40,499
No, but it's been fun watching you...

40
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:47,370
This was your idea!

41
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:51,647

Calm down!

44
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:20,579
Why do you let them treat you like this?

45
00:06:21,114 --> 00:06:22,604
Be strong.

46
00:06:23,282 --> 00:06:24,681
Where is your pride?

47
00:06:29,722 --> 00:06:32,782
It all works... Yes?

48
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:37,423
Yes...

49
00:06:37,964 --> 00:06:40,728
...I just can't make children.

50
00:06:46,172 --> 00:06:48,732
There is something I will tell you...

51
00:06:49,442 --> 00:06:52,707
...but I warn you, it's very powerful.

52
00:06:54,347 --> 00:06:55,143
What do you speak of?

53
00:06:55,948 --> 00:06:57,540
The soanzo leaf.

54
00:06:58,951 --> 00:07:00,316
The soanzo leaf?

55
00:07:00,586 --> 00:07:03,248
From the great marshes in the south...

56
00:07:08,094 --> 00:07:11,120
This is what gave me my ten children.

57
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:19,665
No! No! Wait...

58
00:07:21,007 --> 00:07:23,339
You have to rub them on... down there.

59
00:07:24,043 --> 00:07:26,307
Just before you next try.

60
00:07:26,546 --> 00:07:28,605
Apply it generously...

61
00:07:33,219 --> 00:07:35,278
I don't know how to thank you.

62
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:40,453
If this works...
maybe she'll stop bothering me.

63
00:07:40,893 --> 00:07:41,985
Your wife?

64
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:44,293
No, her mother.

65
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:47,030
The old hag wants grandchildren.

66
00:07:56,576 --> 00:07:58,134
Give me some meat.

67
00:07:58,644 --> 00:08:00,635
Here, work on this...

68
00:08:01,047 --> 00:08:02,878
...pure meat...

69
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:06,882

00:09:16,889 --> 00:09:18,186
What do you want?

[leaves rustling]

75
00:10:13,679 --> 00:10:18,844
I am Flint Sky. I have hunted
this forest from the day I came of age.

76
00:10:20,353 --> 00:10:24,756
My father hunted this forest
with me and before me.

77
00:10:26,392 --> 00:10:28,326
Jaguar Paw, my son.

78
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:30,960
He hunts this forest with me.

79
00:10:32,498 --> 00:10:35,990
He will hunt it with his son
after I am gone.

80
00:10:56,155 --> 00:10:57,520
A good catch?

81
00:10:58,357 --> 00:11:00,325
Good waters here.

82
00:11:02,995 --> 00:11:04,462
The forest gives much here.

83
00:11:10,569 --> 00:11:12,503
We ask only to pass through.

84
00:11:13,372 --> 00:11:14,669
Pass.

85
00:11:20,546 --> 00:11:22,377
Keep safe as you pass.

86
00:11:26,018 --> 00:11:27,576
Let's go.

- [baby cries]
- [indistinct whispering]

88
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:06,551
Our lands were ravaged.

89
00:12:07,426 --> 00:12:09,360
We seek a new beginning.

90
00:12:16,335 --> 00:12:17,893
Your lands were ravaged?

91
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:23,267
Yes...

92
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:27,273
We seek a new beginning...

93
00:12:27,847 --> 00:12:29,109
Be still.

94
00:12:29,348 --> 00:12:30,280
My son!

95
00:12:32,284 --> 00:12:33,546
Be still.

96
00:12:38,691 --> 00:12:39,988
Back to the village.

[chirping]

99
00:13:13,726 --> 00:13:18,629
I ask you not to speak
of what you saw in the forest today.

100
00:13:22,535 --> 00:13:24,662
You are troubled.

101
00:13:24,904 --> 00:13:26,633
Yes, I am.

102
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:37,743
[indistinct chatter]

103
00:13:43,155 --> 00:13:47,285
Those people in the forest,
what did you see on them?

104
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:48,987
I do not understand.

105
00:13:50,095 --> 00:13:51,562
Fear.

106
00:13:54,867 --> 00:13:57,836
Deep rotting fear.

107
00:13:58,404 --> 00:14:00,964
They were infected by it.

108
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:03,138
Did you see?

109
00:14:03,676 --> 00:14:05,837
Fear is a sickness.

110
00:14:11,116 --> 00:14:15,246
It will crawl into the soul
of anyone who engages it.

111
00:14:17,056 --> 00:14:21,220
It has tainted your peace already.

112
00:14:23,429 --> 00:14:27,525
I did not raise you
to see you live with fear.

113
00:14:30,069 --> 00:14:31,764
Strike it from your heart.

114
00:14:31,971 --> 00:14:34,667
Do not bring it into our village.

115
00:14:35,207 --> 00:14:38,836
At first light
we will gather with the elders...

116
00:14:39,745 --> 00:14:42,873
...at the sacred hill of our fathers.

117
00:14:43,649 --> 00:14:47,915
There we will call on
their spirits to guide us.

118
00:14:48,587 --> 00:14:50,680
[children laughing]

119
00:14:56,061 --> 00:14:58,757
[growling]

120
00:14:59,098 --> 00:15:00,793
Oh, here he is!

121
00:15:01,767 --> 00:15:03,098
The big lump!

122
00:15:03,936 --> 00:15:05,403
He's useless.

123
00:15:06,105 --> 00:15:07,595
He can't do it.

124
00:15:07,673 --> 00:15:09,334
[all laughing]

125
00:15:09,408 --> 00:15:10,898
You! Yes you!

126
00:15:11,644 --> 00:15:15,045
With your height and your girth.
You have deceived us.

127
00:15:16,115 --> 00:15:17,377
Get inside!

128
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:24,446
Damn you! Get in there!

129
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:26,280
Old woman, please.

130
00:15:26,692 --> 00:15:27,659
Move it!

131
00:15:32,031 --> 00:15:33,498
You don't work!

132
00:15:36,035 --> 00:15:37,502
What are you laughing about?

133
00:15:45,477 --> 00:15:49,971
Give me a grandchild
or I will have you replaced.

134
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:53,015
Mother, that's enough.

135
00:15:54,019 --> 00:15:57,113
Do not come out until you make a child.

136
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:00,315
Two would be better!

137
00:16:00,559 --> 00:16:01,491
What?

138
00:16:03,162 --> 00:16:05,153
Twins you oaf.

139
00:16:13,906 --> 00:16:14,668
Mother.

140
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:19,975
Can you go away?
He says he can't with you sitting there.

141
00:16:20,412 --> 00:16:21,777
Just get busy.

142
00:16:23,048 --> 00:16:24,345
Mom...

143
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:30,455
She's gone.

144
00:16:31,357 --> 00:16:33,086
[shouting]

145
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:16,763
Mother, what do you say we should
have at the feast tonight?

146
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:19,732
I have tapir...
but I also found this boy.

147
00:17:20,439 --> 00:17:21,167
[Mother] I say boy.

148
00:17:21,373 --> 00:17:22,271
Roasted!

149
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:25,169
The tapir smells better.
I think it's more fresh.

150
00:17:25,577 --> 00:17:27,511
No Dad! No! It's me! It's me!

151
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:30,511
I'll just hang the boy here
in case we change our minds.

152
00:17:34,086 --> 00:17:34,780
Wait...

153
00:17:34,987 --> 00:17:37,854
That's our Turtles Run.
That's our eldest.

154
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:40,525
Yes it's me. It's your eldest!

155
00:17:41,427 --> 00:17:44,726
In that case, a crush for my eldest...

156
00:17:48,333 --> 00:17:50,631
...and a crush for my youngest.

157
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:54,202
[Mother] Tapir it is.

158
00:17:54,273 --> 00:17:56,537
[Blunted moaning]

159
00:17:56,608 --> 00:18:01,545
[both hollering]

160
00:18:09,455 --> 00:18:11,980
[all laughing]

161
00:19:00,339 --> 00:19:01,772
One day, old man!

162
00:19:02,341 --> 00:19:04,639
One day you won't be able
to run anymore!

163
00:19:22,361 --> 00:19:25,489
[man] And a Man sat alone.

164
00:19:26,932 --> 00:19:29,457
Drenched deep in sadness.

165
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:32,967
And all the animals
drew near to him and said:

166
00:19:33,605 --> 00:19:37,405
"We do not like to see you so sad...

167
00:19:39,211 --> 00:19:42,647
"Ask us for whatever you wish
and you shall have it."

168
00:19:43,682 --> 00:19:48,051
The Man said:
"I want to have good sight."

169
00:19:49,454 --> 00:19:52,651
The vulture replied:
"You shall have mine."

170
00:19:55,694 --> 00:19:58,891
The Man said: "I want to be strong."

171
00:20:02,601 --> 00:20:04,364
The jaguar said:

172
00:20:06,738 --> 00:20:09,673
"You shall be strong like me."

173
00:20:11,643 --> 00:20:17,513
Then the Man said: "I long
to know the secrets of the earth."

174
00:20:19,084 --> 00:20:24,044
The serpent replied:
"I will show them to you."

175
00:20:25,958 --> 00:20:28,449
And so it went with all the animals.

176
00:20:30,162 --> 00:20:32,892
And when the Man had
all the gifts that they could give...

177
00:20:33,098 --> 00:20:34,725
...he left.

178
00:20:36,301 --> 00:20:38,565
Then the owl said to the other animals:

179
00:20:39,504 --> 00:20:43,372
"Now the Man knows much
and is able to do many things...

180
00:20:44,476 --> 00:20:47,809
"Suddenly I am afraid."

181
00:20:51,016 --> 00:20:53,814
The deer said:
"The Man has all that he needs."

182
00:20:54,953 --> 00:20:56,944
"Now his sadness will stop."

183
00:20:57,589 --> 00:20:59,580
But the owl replied: "No."

184
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:05,128
"I saw a hole in the Man...

185
00:21:06,131 --> 00:21:09,897
"Deep like a hunger
he will never fill...

186
00:21:10,936 --> 00:21:15,430
"It is what makes him sad
and what makes him want."

187

[indistinct shouting]

377
01:02:00,083 --> 01:02:02,347
Where are they taking us?

378
01:02:06,656 --> 01:02:11,059
We tell stories of a place stone-built.

379
01:02:12,595 --> 01:02:14,119
What happens there?

380
01:02:15,064 --> 01:02:16,463
I do not know...

381
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:21,527
...but the earth bleeds.

382
01:02:24,574 --> 01:02:26,474
We are near.

383
01:03:08,184 --> 01:03:09,776
Salvation!

384
01:03:10,386 --> 01:03:13,446
He has the laughing sickness.

385
01:03:14,457 --> 01:03:16,482
He likes you!

386
01:03:19,061 --> 01:03:20,289
Help me!

387
01:03:28,671 --> 01:03:30,502
Save me.

388
01:03:38,414 --> 01:03:39,938
Die like a man.

389
01:03:40,016 --> 01:03:42,007
[whimpering]

390
01:05:41,270 --> 01:05:44,569

[growling]

392
01:06:20,576 --> 01:06:21,668
Welcome back.

393
01:06:22,812 --> 01:06:24,279
Have you been successful?

394
01:06:24,880 --> 01:06:25,972
Ask my son.

395
01:06:27,917 --> 01:06:29,282
How many captives?

396
01:06:29,518 --> 01:06:30,485
Deal with my son.

397
01:06:32,588 --> 01:06:33,646
A fair price.

398
01:06:35,091 --> 01:06:36,854
As always, trust me.

399
01:06:37,693 --> 01:06:38,352
Good.

400
01:06:40,029 --> 01:06:42,327
[speaking in Mayan]

401
01:06:56,212 --> 01:06:58,908
How much will you give me?

402
01:07:01,217 --> 01:07:03,378
[shouting indistinctly]

403
01:07:32,882 --> 01:07:34,543

404
01:07:40,189 --> 01:07:42,180
[all yelling]

405
01:08:00,643 --> 01:08:02,543
Who will buy this woman?

406
01:08:03,612 --> 01:08:04,977
No... she's too old.

407
01:08:06,315 --> 01:08:08,112
She can be useful.

408
01:08:08,617 --> 01:08:10,312
She can cook... clean...

409
01:08:11,854 --> 01:08:13,913
Useless old woman!

410
01:08:17,593 --> 01:08:19,117
No sale.

411
01:08:24,867 --> 01:08:26,232
Go!

412
01:08:27,336 --> 01:08:28,598
Go on.

413
01:08:32,608 --> 01:08:35,304
[chanting continues]

414
01:09:19,722 --> 01:09:22,282
