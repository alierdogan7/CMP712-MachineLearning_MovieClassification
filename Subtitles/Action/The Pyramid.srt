00:34:27,680 --> 00:34:29,011
I saw its eyes.

689
00:34:29,640 --> 00:34:31,449
FITZIE: (STAMMERS)
What was it?

690
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:32,840
HOLDEN: Yeah, hold on.

691
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,161
It was the same thing we saw

692
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:36,129
before we lost
contact with Shorty.

693
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:37,281
(GROANS)
Sorry, sorry.

694
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:39,841
You know,
maybe it's the soldier.

695
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,889
He knows we're down here.
He's probably gonna be
looking for us.

696
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:44,566
A soldier popped out of a hidden
tunnel and scratched my face.

697
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:49,527
Maybe there's a way
out over there.

698
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:58,642
NORA: Hey, Michael.
Michael.

699
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:04,330
These carvings
tell a story.

700
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:06,847
You see these figures
holding the spears.

701
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:09,122
These are the same ones
we saw in the apex.

702
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:13,325
This is a warning.

703
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:16,201
A warning?

704
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:19,451
A warning for what?

705
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:20,726
I don't know.

706
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:22,884
I think we should
just stay here.

707
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:25,322
That soldier will come
looking for us eventually.

708
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:27,369
No, Michael might not
have that long.

709
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:28,721
We have to look
for another way out.

710
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:29,927
All right, then, fine.

711
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,206
What is your
plan now, Nora?

712
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:32,691
SUNNI: If there is
a gate here...

713
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:34,640
then behind those stones
there is a passage...

714
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:35,886
and maybe another way out.

715
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:38,560
And if the gate has been standing
here for thousands of years...

716
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:40,205
maybe it's standing here
for a reason.

717
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:41,361
Who are we to destroy it?

718
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:42,567
SUNNI: Jesus!

719
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:44,600
Stop being an archaeologist
for a minute here...

720
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:45,841
and start being
a human being!

721
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,331
Look, she's right,
okay?

722
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:49,164
We have to look
for help!

723
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:51,444
Maybe we can try the shaft.
Nora!

724
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:53,090
Look at her face!

725
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:54,930
We don't know
what's up there!

00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:00,011
FITZIE: Look, guys, we can't
just sit around here.

727
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:02,123
Okay, we've got
things up there

728
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:03,964

729
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:05,207

back on.

734
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:17,931
And while we're
trapped in here

735
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,890
we're like food
in a bowl right now.

736

All right, fine.

737
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:32,160

I got it.
Let's go over here.

You said Anubis.

1410
01:13:44,560 --> 01:13:45,846
Osiris was his father...

or his creator.

1412

came from the heavens...

That's what
I'm trying to tell you.

1419
01:14:03,280 --> 01:14:04,850
Osiris knew that his time
had come on Earth...

1420
01:14:05,040 --> 01:14:06,280
so he had
this pyramid built

1421
01:14:06,360 --> 01:14:07,720
for his journey
into the afterlife.

1422
01:14:07,880 --> 01:14:09,166

look...

down on tape. All right?

1424

You can watch it back
as soon as we're out.

1425
01:14:14,640 --> 01:14:16,608
Anubis turned his wrath
on the people.

1426
01:14:17,800 --> 01:14:20,007
He had hundreds
of them sacrificed...

1427
01:14:20,160 --> 01:14:22,049
so he could join his father
in the afterlife.

1428
01:14:22,680 --> 01:14:24,011
Since his soul
was corrupted,

1429
01:14:24,080 --> 01:14:25,730
he was looking
for a pure one...

1430
01:14:25,880 --> 01:14:27,928
a pure heart, if you will.

1431
01:14:28,920 --> 01:14:31,082
The only way to enter
the final gate of heaven.

1432
01:14:32,400 --> 01:14:34,084
My father was right.

1433
01:14:34,280 --> 01:14:36,328
This pyramid
became a prison.

1434
01:14:36,960 --> 01:14:39,440
Closed by the Egyptians
to get rid of their own god.

1435

give us any clues

1436
01:14:42,360 --> 01:14:43,850
on how to get out of here?

1437
01:14:44,040 --> 01:14:45,485
It says something
about a star map.

1438
01:14:45,640 --> 01:14:46,880
Then you got
to find it, okay?

1439
01:14:47,080 --> 01:14:50,243
Because your friend Anubis is
gonna be back any minute now!

1440
01:14:51,760 --> 01:14:53,489

points to where the dead

1441

was supposed to be
resurrected.

1443
01:14:59,640 --> 01:15:01,847

six shafts in this room.

1444
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:03,480

which is the right one?

all those dots.

1451
01:15:23,720 --> 01:15:25,688

are we looking for?

1452
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:27,490
The tetrahedron.

1453
01:15:27,640 --> 01:15:29,130
The three-sided
pyramid is also

1454
01:15:29,200 --> 01:15:31,362
the hieroglyphic symbol
for the Sirius star.

1455
01:15:35,680 --> 01:15:37,648

this shaft.

01:24:24,720 --> 01:24:27,564
<i>Disintegrate</i>

1560
01:24:28,040 --> 01:24:30,407
<i>The body that I'm holding</i>

1561
01:24:30,480 --> 01:24:35,122
<i>I will sacrifice
more than a thousand lives</i>

1562
01:24:35,200 --> 01:24:38,124
<i>My soul won't be crucified</i>

1563
01:24:38,320 --> 01:24:41,483
<i>I'll come back
with light shining</i>

1564
01:24:41,720 --> 01:24:44,610
<i>Whoa, whoa, whoa</i>

1565
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:50,166
<i>Whoa, whoa, whoa</i>

1566
01:24:50,240 --> 01:24:54,131
<i>Get back what
you took from me</i>

1567
01:24:54,440 --> 01:24:57,410
<i>Hey, hey, hey, hey</i>

1568
01:24:57,480 --> 01:24:58,970
<i>Hey, hey, hey</i>

1569
01:25:02,200 --> 01:25:05,921
<i>Get back what
you took from me</i>

1570
01:25:06,400 --> 01:25:09,210
<i>Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey</i>

1571
01:25:18,360 --> 01:25:21,603
<i>Prepare my grave</i>

1572
01:25:21,880 --> 01:25:24,690
<i>For what I know,
it's waiting</i>

1573
01:25:24,760 --> 01:25:27,081
<i>I welcome in</i>

1574
01:25:27,880 --> 01:25:30,724
<i>All that I am fearing</i>

1575
01:25:30,800 --> 01:25:33,770
<i>There's no way out</i>

1576
01:25:33,840 --> 01:25:36,684
<i>Now I must shed my skin</i>

1577
01:25:36,920 --> 01:25:42,086
<i>The only way through
the flame of fire within</i>

1578
01:25:42,320 --> 01:25:44,641
<i>I will sacrifice</i>

1579
01:25:44,720 --> 01:25:47,200
<i>More than a thousand lives</i>

1580
01:25:47,320 --> 01:25:50,130
<i>My soul won't be crucified</i>

1581
01:25:50,280 --> 01:25:54,080
<i>Get back what
you took from me</i>

1582
01:25:54,400 --> 01:25:55,970
Me...

1583
01:26:06,760 --> 01:26:09,445
<i>In the dark there is light</i>

1584
01:26:09,800 --> 01:26:12,565
<i>In the day there is night</i>

1585
01:26:12,680 --> 01:26:15,604
<i>In the peace there is fight</i>

1586
01:26:15,760 --> 01:26:18,570
<i>I started a war</i>

1587
01:26:18,680 --> 01:26:21,763
<i>In the dark there is light</i>

1588
01:26:21,880 --> 01:26:24,611

01:26:30,840 --> 01:26:33,684
<i>In the dark there is light</i>

1592
01:26:33,880 --> 01:26:36,565
<i>In the day there is night</i>

1593
01:26:36,920 --> 01:26:39,605
<i>In the peace there is fight</i>

1594
01:26:39,840 --> 01:26:42,491
<i>I started a war</i>

1595

<i>In the dark there is light</i>

1596
01:26:45,800 --> 01:26:48,770
