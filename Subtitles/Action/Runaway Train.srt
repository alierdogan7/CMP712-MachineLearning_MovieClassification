( "The Yellow Rose of Texas"
playing in the distance)

2
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:14,870
Stonehaven Maximum Security Prison,
Alaska, USA

3
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:27,836
(TV) The men ranged in ages from
14 to 1 9.Il were killed in the plane crash.

4
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:30,952
Names are being withheld
until notification of next of kin.

5
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:33,833
We switch now to our reporter
at the federal courthouse

6
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:36,997
for the latest on the
Manheim-Stonehaven Prison case.

7
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:41,398
We've just gotten word that the federal
judge has issued his opinion in this case.

8
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:45,115
We don't have all the details,
but apparently Oscar Manheim,

9
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:49,518
the notorious life-term prisoner who has
been welded in his cell for three years,

10
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:53,235
has won his civil rights suit
against officials at Stonehaven.

11
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:57,911
Stay with us for details. We'll be back with
comment from Associate Warden Ranken.

12
00:02:58,040 --> 00:02:59,996
Yeah! I say yeah!

13
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:08,040
(men shouting)

14
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:17,151
- Hey, Rogers.ogers, looky here, man.
- What's up?

15
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:21,034
Manny's won his case. The court's
ordered to let him out of the hole.

16
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:23,116
Great. That's great.

17
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:26,676
Warden Ranken's gonna be
on the tube in a couple of minutes.

18
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:32,989
Let the dudes hear him talk that shit
he talks. Put Channel 9 into the speakers.

19
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,076
Rogers? Rogers?

20
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:40,917
Have you got shit in your veins
or what, man?

21
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:46,512
I was holding my mud around here
when you were peeing in your diapers.

22
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:49,029
All right. They'll all hear it.

23
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:51,469
Fuckin' A, man!

24
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:54,558
I say, Rogers, thanks, man. Yeah!

25
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:58,389
(reporter) Nobody wants prison
to be easy. We want criminals punished.

26
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:00,829
But don't you think
you shocked the public

27
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:05,875
by keeping a man
welded in a cell for three years?

28
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,788
Well, a man, yes.
But Manheim is an animal.

29
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:14,232
He broke out of here twice,
he's robbed banks, he's a killer.

30
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:19,115
He doesn't care about your life,
my life, or even his own life...

31
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:22,198
Fuck your mother!

32
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:25,915
- Get it out your ass, Ranken!
- Fat-faced faggot!

33
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:29,919
- Somebody shoot that Nazi vegetable!
- Manny for president!

34
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:35,068
(Ranken)..seventeen. He believes
in nothing, so he's capable of anything.

35
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:40,069
I've worked in prisons for 26 years. Fiends
with strings of murders are afraid of him.

36
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:43,158
Jesus Henry Christ. =w! Yeah!

37
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:45,236
(men shouting)

38
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:56,233
Hey, Jonah! Jonah!

39
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:59,115
Hey, Jonah!

40
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:00,912
- Manny did it, man.
- Yeah.

41
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:04,874
- He really fuckin' did it.
- That's good, man. I'll see you in the yard.

42
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,230
Yeah. Yeah.

43
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,509
(whoops)

44
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:15,034
If, as you say, he is an animal, then why
do all the prisoners love him so much?

45
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:19,995
Well, because they're...
they're mostly animals, just like he is.

46
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:22,634
They wanna do whatever they want,
no holds barred.

47
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:26,639
- =pen the fucking door!
- Fuck you and the horse you rode in on!

48
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:29,069
=pen this goddamn door, Rogers!

49
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:39,719
This is no country club. Stonehaven's
average sentence is 22 years.

50
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,831
(alarm)

51
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:46,873
Turn that fucker off!

52
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:53,230
( "The Yellow Rose of Texas")

53
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,715
(convict) Fuck your mother!

54
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:00,069
¡Chinga tu madre, pinche puto!

55
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:11,269
( "The Yellow Rose of Texas" continues)

56
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:17,589
Ranken, how do you like the renovation
on your prison? We fixed it for ya!

57
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:25,512
Ranken, your mother's a dog
and you're an asshole.

58
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:44,794
Hey, Manny! You got visitors.

59
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,756
(short, sharp breaths)

60
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:08,396
=n your feet, convict.

61
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,756
=n your feet.

62
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:26,514
I've got a court order
to let you out of the hole.

63
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:30,599
Course, I could ask for a stay during
the appeal. The court would go for that.

64
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:34,554
I can last nine more months
through an appeal.

65
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:37,433
I could stand on my head nine months.

66
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:41,348
- I oughta wreck this door and kick your...
- Fuck you!

67
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:46,679
- You wouldn't do it alone.
- I don't dirty my hands on scum like you.

68
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:51,388
I'm gonna let you out in the yard.

69
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:55,593
And I hope you make a move
so I can stop your clock. That's a promise.

70
00:07:55,720 --> 00:08:00,271
Yeah, a promise. You promised to keep
me in this hole for the rest of my life.

71
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:05,795
I kept you in here for three years.
That's long enough for me, kid.

72
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:09,071
Whatever doesn't kill me
makes me stronger.

73
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,758
We'll see.

74
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:15,032
Please try again,
and I'll send you out of here in plastic.

75
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:25,038
You do what you have to do
and I'll do what I have to do.

76
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:27,720
Whatever happens happens.

77
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:34,431
Call the machine shop.
Bring him to the yard.

78
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:41,319
(blows raspberry)

79
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:46,116
That's your mama's fart-hole, Ranken.
The bitch is loud.

80
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:48,196
(derisive laughter)

81
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:55,593
You're all punks,
hiding there, yelling in the dark.

82
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:59,076
Let me tell you where you assholes stand.

83
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,072
First there's God.

84
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:07,318
Then the warden. Then my guards.

85
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:10,193
Then the dogs out there in the kennel.

86
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,754
And finally you -

87
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:16,429
pieces of human waste.

88
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:21,190
No good to yourselves or anybody else.

89
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:37,756
(Jonah) Yeah, here he is, man.
The big man.

90
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:45,672
Hey, Manny.
Homeboy. It's me, Home.

91
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:48,155
I'm blind, man. I can't see.

92
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:50,635
Hey, Manny. Here you go, man.

93
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:57,910
- Let's go. Should be time for lockup.
- Let me get that for you, Manny.

94
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:01,032
What's been happening
these past three years?

95
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:04,869
Just what you know. I went out
and got a fresh 30-year sentence.

96
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,560
- Couldn't make it without me?
- Without the money.

97
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:09,671
Never did know how to rob a bank.

98
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:14,828
- (PA) The following men have visitors...
- Don't worry about it. I'll get you out.

99
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:18,032
- Not in this winter, you won't.
- I won't?

100
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:21,709
- Kiss my white ass.
- Hey, what's the...?

101
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:27,790
He's a pretty good youngster.
Besides that, he pushes the laundry cart.

102
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:37,989
Welcome home, brother.
Welcome home, man.

103
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:02,636
Kill the son of a bitch!

104
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:04,876
(cheering)

105
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:08,755
=ne, two...

106
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:11,356
( "Oh! Susanna")

107
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:19,476
- (bell rings)
- Nine!

108
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:26,756
- The kid can fight.
- It's worth about two dead flies.

109
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:32,113
Yeah, but you shouldn't judge people
hard, man. I'm gonna take a piss.

110
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:38,679
=fficer, this guy's grabbin' my ass!
You kept him in the hole too long, Ranken.

111
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,556
(wolf-whistling)

112
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:53,799
Take that punk out.
Take him out.

113
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:57,395
- (bell)
- (cheering)

114
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:03,716
Jab! Punch!

115
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:12,236
What are you doing?

116
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:15,514
Come on, man. Yo, man, back off!

117
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:21,394
- (bell)
- You all right, man?

118
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:27,831
(referee) And still the welterweight
champion: Buck McGee!

119
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:30,599
(cheering)

120
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:52,556
(Manny moans)

121
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:08,555
I'm sorry, Manny.
Ranken made me do it.

122
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:10,636
- Come on, punk.
- No more!

123
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:12,830
Come on. Show me somethin'.

124
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:23,310
- Come on, Manny!
- Come here, you rat stoolie. Come here.

125
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:26,352
- Come on. I got somethin' for you.
- I'm sorry, Manny!

126
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:28,232
No! Stay back.

127
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:31,633
You want me?
You want my blood? Here.

128
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:34,433
There, there's my blood.
Come on, scum.

129
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:41,234
You wanna shoot me? Shoot me!

130
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:43,635
Shoot to kill, sucker. Here I am.

131
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:45,955
Come on, Ranken. Shoot to kill.

132
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:49,755
Don't send no punk to do
your business for ya. I'm right here.

133
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:53,953
Come on. Shoot me.
I'm goin' nowhere. Come on.

134
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:57,356
Come on, Ranken. Make your move.

135
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:01,553
Hey, sucker, you show me shit!

136
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:05,350
(Manny) No, Joe. He's mine.

137
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:12,792
Get off me! Let me go!

138
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:18,519
Jonah! Jonah!

139
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:21,234
I'll kill ya. I'll kill ya. I'll kill ya.

140
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:24,235
I'll tear his fuckin' head off!

141
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:29,551
=h, my God.
Can't someone do something?

142
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:33,309
(guard over PA)
Lockup. Mandatory lockup.

143
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:35,590
All prisoners in the cell.

144
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:39,550
All prisoners in the cell.

145
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:42,596
Mandatory lockup.

146
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,673
You look terrible.

147
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:15,234
I ain't dead.

148
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:20,832
He released me to the yard.

149
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:23,713
He wants to kill you for sure.

150
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:27,196
Nah, he's pushin' me.
He wants me to jump the wall.

151
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:30,437
- He's pushin' me.
- It's 30 below out there.

152
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:33,199
I'm goin'. You comin'?

153
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:36,551
Are you comin'? I'll wait for ya.

154
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:41,510
No, brother.

155
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:45,633
This is home.
I run things around here.

156
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:49,036
I can't take these ass-kickings
like I used to.

157
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,676
I can make it.

158
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:59,360
Then get on, brother, and do it.

159
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:03,755
I will.

160
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:06,997
Whatever happens,
don't let 'em bring you back here, man.

161
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:09,509
Nah.

162
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:14,350
I'll find some... nice joint in the sun.

163
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:17,119
Manny, the bulls are on the stairs.

164
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,956
Let's split.

165
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:21,638
- Have fun.
- You too.

166
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:34,709
There's gonna be convicts watching you.
Don't let 'em ice ya. It'll break a lot of soul.

167
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:37,877
You know, you got a following,
and I love you.

168
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:46,157
Comin' through. Hit the basket, man.

169
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:50,637
Comin' through. Hey, you guys,
hit the basket, =K? Goddamn.

170
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:52,716
Comin' through.

171
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,514
(convict) Check out the starch
in these socks.

172
00:16:56,640 --> 00:17:00,474
- Check my laundry.
- (wolf-whistling)

173
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:03,672
Get in here and check my laundry.

174
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:05,836
Hey, Buck. See you later.

175
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:21,439
- You're late, man.
- They were late with the showers. Here.

176
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:31,791
- Comin' through, boss. Comin' through.
- Just hold your horses.

177
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:37,076
- How you doin', Jackson?
- What's up?

178
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:39,555
Another bit of laundry, huh?

179
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:49,716
- Jackson, have I got a surprise for you.
- What is it?

180
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:54,038
You know you told me your son
is going to the Golden Gloves this year?

181
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:55,912
Shit!

182
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:01,919
Jackson, check 'em out, man.

183
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:06,835
- Thanks, Buck.
- You betcha.

184
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:12,508
And I'll tell you what, Jackson.

185
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:16,633
Since you have always been so good
to me, you get these suckers for $80.

186
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:19,593
They go for $200, but you get 'em for $80.

187
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:22,553
- I don't have $80.
- No problem. I'll tell you what we do.

188
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:26,992
We'll put you on layaway plan -
that is, you get me when you get me.

189
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:31,238
- All right, my man.
- No problem. We can work it out.

190
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:34,477
- This is all right.
- Yeah. Yeah, nice, huh?

191
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:36,556
This is all right.

192
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:52,199
=oh, mama. January 1985.

193
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:56,313
This bitch is the crème de la crème
of white pussy, isn't she, Jackson?

194
00:18:56,440 --> 00:19:00,991
Yeah, that Hugh Hefner sure knows
what the fuck he's doin', don't he?

195
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:05,557
- You got that right.
- Hey, she might be white, but she's right.

196
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:08,319
I know, Buck.
Hey, let me give you a hand.

197
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:10,396
Uh, all right.

198
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:14,075
Hey, uh, Jackson.

199
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:20,594
- You tell your boy I said good luck.
- Thanks, Buck. Thanks for everything.

200
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:36,793
Just walkin' with the laundry, boss.

201
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:38,114
(buzzer)

202
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:52,149
See? White pussy gets that
son of a bitch every goddamn time.

203
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:54,236
Shut up.

204
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:03,672
All right, man. Come on. Come on.
Go for it. Go for it.

205
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:09,551
- Thanks, youngster. I owe you one.
- Hey, Manny. Take me with you.

206
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:18,269
Shit, man. I'm goin'.
I'm goin', man. I'm fuckin' goin'.

207
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:22,632
Yeah. I'm goin'. I'm goin'.
I'm gettin' outta here.

208
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:27,949
Manny. Hey, Manny.

209
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:31,993
Shut up, fool.
What are you doin' here?

210
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:35,271
- Hey, you need me, man.
- What good are you?

211
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:38,631
I got two hands to your one,
I can more than carry my weight

212
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:42,036
and, look. I got us street clothes.

213
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:43,991
Son of a bitch.

214
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:46,793
=K, fool. Get your clothes off
and grease down.

215
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:48,876
All right.

216
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:02,836
=oh, mama! This shit is nasty.

217
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:08,036
Goddamn.

218
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:24,634
=K, Manny. What do we do now?

219
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:27,991
Keep your mouth shut.
You talk too much.

220
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:06,471
Comin' down.

221
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:08,830
- We gotta go in there?
- I am.

222
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:16,916
Duffel bag.

223
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:20,996
Pull the cover over.

224
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:27,630
=h, man. I don't like this shit.

225
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:30,714
(Manny) Let's go. Let's go. Come on.

226
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:41,079
- (Buck) I'm comin', man. I'm comin'.
- Keep up.

227
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:44,911
It stinks in here, goddamn.

228
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:48,112
- You never been in a sewer before?
- No.

229
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:50,754
Manny, wait up a minute. Wait up.

230
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:52,871
Manny, I put my hands in a pile of shit.

231
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,434
Don't worry. It'll rinse off.

232
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:59,712
- Here, give me that.
- (Buck retches)

233
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:02,593
If you're gonna get sick,
this is the place to do it.

234
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:07,157
(Buck) =h, man. This is nasty.
This is nasty. Goddamn.

235
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:10,913
Wait!

236
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:12,792
Man.

237
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:17,678
=h, man. This is so gross.

238
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:20,837
- =K, what do we do now?
- Here, hold it.

239
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:25,590
Hold it! Hold it!
Like a baby. Like a baby, hold it!

240
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:28,553
It stinks in here, man.

241
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:34,232
(Manny) You don't like that smell?
That's the smell of freedom, brother.

242
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:52,957
- I'm goin'.
- Wait. =K, wait.

243
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:56,117
Hey, Manny. Here, man.

244
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:58,196
- Give me the light.
- Yeah, the light.

245
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:00,276
Duffel bag.

246
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:04,831
(Buck) =K, wait, man.
Wait, wait, wait, wait. (laughs)

247
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:11,354
You know, Ranken's gonna fuckin' shit his
pants, man.anken's gonna fuckin' die.

248
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:13,789
- (clatter)
- Hey, Manny.

249
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:16,832
- Hey, Manny? Manny, where's the light?
- Fell.

250
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:19,394
- Where'd it fall?
- 300 feet into the river.

251
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:23,513
- Nobody told me about 300 feet.
- Nobody told you cos nobody invited you.

252
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:26,074
You wanna go back, go ahead.
Me, I'm goin'.

253
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:28,270
No, man.

254
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,470
Manny! Manny!

255
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:44,836

256
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:48,756

258
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:54,912
Manny!

259
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:08,230
(men chanting)
Manny! Manny! Manny! Manny!

260
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:31,318
They came this way all right.
No doubt about it.

261
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:33,271
He did it.

262
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:35,914
The son of a bitch, he did it.

263
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:37,393
=K.

264
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:41,593
Manny! Manny! Manny! Manny!

265
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:06,512
Stop searching the prison.

266
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:12,715
Notify the state police and get
their pictures out. You know what to do.

267
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:14,671
God,

268
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:16,950
don't kill them.

269
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:18,638
Let me do it.

270
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:20,716
(chanting continues)

271
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:46,270
Manny! Hold up a goddamn minute.

272
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:49,790
Get your tail out from between your legs.

273
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:53,469
- Manny! I don't wanna die.
- I'm hurtin' too.

274
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:56,273
At least you got shoes!

275
00:26:56,400 --> 00:27:01,110
- How much farther we gotta go, man?
- Half a mile. Who knows?

276
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:04,635
Maybe I can make half a mile.

277
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:09,433
=h, man.

278
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:12,120
Shoes. I need shoes.

279
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:09,319
=h, man. =h, man.

280
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:13,479
- Put that bench next to the door there.
- What? =h.

281
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:21,430
I need some fuckin' shoes.

282
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:24,757
You know, it's unbelievable, man.

283
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:32,230
=nly two other guys got out once, and
you beat that sucker three times. Yeah.

284
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:38,356
Manny, don't you know? Ranken
is knee-walkin' pissed off, man. Shit.

285
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:43,429
And the dudes, man.
=h, Manny, the dudes - they love it.

286
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:45,516
They love it.

287
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:50,035
- Freeze, sucker.
- Nobody's gonna hear us.

288
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:52,116
Just don't do it.

289
00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:01,032
Hey, Manny.
You don't treat me like your punk, =K?

290
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:03,594
- You don't like it?
- No.

291
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:06,712
Well, you're a prizefighter.

292
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:08,637
Kick my ass.

293
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:10,557
Make your move.

294
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:15,269
No.

295
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:19,234
I'm not gonna give you no reason
to kill me, Manny.

296
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:25,030
- Please don't.
- =K.

297
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:27,956
I need some shoes, Manny.

298
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:33,514
What we got?

299
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:36,313
Shoes. Let there be shoes, man.

300
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:38,476
I want that, Manny.

301
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:40,556
I want that. Shit.

302
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:49,951
I need some shoes, man.
I need some sh...

303
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:54,668
Manny! Check it out, man. Check it out.

304
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:57,951
Take one for the stomach,
give it here.

305
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:03,394
=oh, mama. That shit is fine.

306
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:05,476
(banging on door)

307
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:18,916
=K. Come on. Let's go.

308
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:22,191
Wait. Wait, man.
I need shoes. I need shoes.

309
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:24,197
I got shoes. I got shoes.

310
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:27,278
I need socks...
I got fuckin' socks.

311
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:34,070
Give me a minute, man.
Just a minute.

312
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,877
=K.

313
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:50,190
- Let's get this.
- Know where it's goin'?

314
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:54,108
- Anywhere's fine by me.
- I don't wanna ride to no parking lot.

315
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:02,192
- Hey, look. Look here.
- What?

316
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:06,154
- There's my limousine to Broadway.
- Why?

317
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:11,717
- Why that one?
- Cos I want it.

318
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:22,789
We're movin', man. We're movin'.

319
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:26,151
Thank you, Jesus. Shit. Shit.

320
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:29,556
Shit, we make a hell of a team,
don't we, man?

321
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:32,119
Don't we?

322
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:19,035
Hey! That looks like Al's train!

323
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:23,915
- What in hell's he doin' out there?
- He looks sick. Damn. Damn.

324
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:25,996
Al!

325
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:29,555
Better call the paramedics.

326
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:40,912
Somethin's wrong.

327
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:44,510
Take it easy, Manny.
They know what they're doin'.

328
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:49,876
- Pulasky! Hello, Pulasky?
- Pulasky.

329
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:53,117
This is Cassidy.
Al fell off the engine. He's dead.

330
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:55,754
A runaway's coming your way
on track two.

331
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:59,111
- What did you say?
- Four units. Stop them, for God sakes!

332
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:01,390
- Speak up, Pulasky.
- Uh, =K.

333
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:05,879
- Switch it to track 1 1.
- I can't. It's too late.

334
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:11,038
Central?

335
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:13,196
Damn you, Central.

336
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:15,276
Emergency.

337
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:17,072
Pick up the goddamn phone!

338
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:19,156
(beeping)

339
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:24,512
=oh, boy. Would I like to have
some of this here for dessert. To go.

340
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:27,552
Hey, Ruby.
Why don't you answer the phone?

341
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:30,399
Hey, come on, Ruby.
You're pretty enough.

342
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:36,550
Aw, shit. Your ass is so lazy. I don't know
why the fuck you got a job here.

343
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:39,831
- Central. Dave Prince speaking.
- Pulasky. Get me Barstow.

344
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:43,635
- Hold it, Pulasky.
- Hold it my ass! Where's Barstow?

345
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:45,557
We got a big emergency.

346
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:47,875
- We got four unmanned units.
- What?

347
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:51,913
I said we got runaway units. Four of them.
They're headed this way.

348
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:56,830
Uh, uh...uby, go get Frank, now.
Run. Come on.

349
00:35:56,960 --> 00:36:00,839
Goddammit, get moving!
We got an emergency here.

350
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:03,838
Hold it, Pulasky, =K? He's coming.

351
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:06,278
It's the phone, Frankie.

352
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:17,394
Frank! Frank, get your ass out here.
We got a runaway on 1 1.

353
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:24,029
- Central? Where are you? Goddammit!
- I'm here. What's up?

354
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:27,948
We got a runaway on track 1 1.
Engineer fell off the train.

355
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:30,799
- Sure nobody else is on board?
- How the hell do I know?

356
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:33,832
- It's gone nine miles and getting faster.
- Nine miles?!

357
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:38,795
- That's right. What are we gonna do?
- Hey, be quiet! Will you calm down?

358
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:42,799
Look, what I want you to do
is line her onto the main line on track one.

359
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:45,957
- Ok.
- Got it? I'll take things over from there.

360
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:48,396
Right, Frank.

361
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:54,676
(bleeping)

362
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:11,918
Shit!

363
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:36,833
- This sucker is flyin', Manny.
- Should've hooked it to those freight cars.

364
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:39,554
Smile, man. We're free. Yeah.

365
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:43,480
- You think so, huh?
- Yeah.

366
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:57,319
Hey, Manny. I want you to know
I'm proud to be your deputy, partner.

367
00:37:57,440 --> 00:38:02,070
Look, kid, I appreciate what you done,
but you ain't no kind of partner to me.

368
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:03,952
Don't be proud of yourself.

369
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:09,438
Look at them tattoos. They'll look really
nice in a swimming pool in Acapulco.

370
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:15,194
What'd I do to deserve this shit from you?

371
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:18,039
You don't know nothin'.
Bein' around me is stupid.

372
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:20,958
I'm at war with the world
and everybody in it.

373
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:24,038
And you're gonna get hurt.

374
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:29,278
- I don't get you, man.
- Rape boys usually are dumb.

375
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:33,439
Rapo?! I ain't no goddamn rapo, man!
Where'd you get that from?

376
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:37,155
It's on your rap sheet.
Busted for rape two years ago.

377
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:39,635
Shit, man!

378
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:42,829
That was just statutory rape.

379
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:46,111
She was 1 5 and I was older than her.

380
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:48,390
That's good.

381
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:51,992
Whoo!

382
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:58,671
- What's wrong? You dyin' for company?
- You think somebody'll be watchin'?

383
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:00,870
I expect nothin'.

384
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:12,029
She's gaining speed fast. She'll hit your
territory soon. Her brakes are burning up.

385
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:13,912
Are you nuts?

386
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:17,432
Her brakes have burnt off.

387
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:20,518
How in the fuck did that happen?
Didn't they check it?

388
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:24,349
- The throttle must be jammed wide open.
- =h, damn!

389
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:29,230
- There she goes.
- =h, God, man. What are we gonna do?

390
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:33,839
I got a wife and two kids.
I ain't got no money like Michael Jackson.

391
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:38,351
- Come on, the system's foolproof.
- Why? Because you designed it?

392
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:42,314
That I did, my boy, and I know
how to use it. Now, let me show you.

393
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:17,629
We'd better fly over the highway.

394
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:21,719
Are you serious? Jesus, those scum
could never make it this far out.

395
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:27,039
- We're freezing our asses off for nothing.
- Shut up. Keep your eyes on the glacier.

396
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:30,118
This guy. I'm telling you.

397
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:32,231
He'd do the same thing I would do.

398
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:04,591
Hey, I just thought about that bank
that you ripped off in Reno. Whoo-ee!

399
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:07,678
I was in reform school.
Man, that was so fucking great.

400
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:11,315
Two million simoleons.
Man, that was hot.

401
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:14,591
Two million is a slight exaggeration.

402
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:16,995
The insurance company.
Standard procedure.

403
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:19,839
Yeah, but it was still fucking great, man.

404
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:21,916
I'll tell you what.

405
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:33,515
Hey, Manny, I know this jug
outside Frisco. It's good for half a mil.

406
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:39,670
They handle payroll for S&A Sugar,
and S&A Sugar is a big outfit, man.

407
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:44,794
That's what I've been dreamin' about -
a really good score. Know what I mean?

408
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:48,831
And I'm gonna party, ooh! Yeah. Shit.

409
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:52,032
I'm gonna go to Mardi Gras,
I'm gonna go to Vegas,

410
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:56,631
and I'm gonna go with enough money in
my hip pocket to catch some fine bitches.

411
00:41:57,320 --> 00:42:03,668
You know, I spend almost every night of
my life dreamin' about this kind of shit.

412
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:05,756
- Dreamin'?
- Yeah.

413
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:08,356
Dreamin'.

414
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:11,237
That's bullshit.

415
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:15,797
You're not gonna do nothin' like that.
I'll tell you what you're gonna do.

416
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:19,310
You're gonna get a job.
That's what you're gonna do - a little job.

417
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:25,231
Some job a convict can get, like sweeping
off trays in a cafeteria or cleaning toilets.

418
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:29,239
And you're gonna hold on to that job
like gold, because it is gold.

419
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:33,399
Let me tell you, Jack, that is gold.
You listenin' to me?

420
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:38,310
And when that man walks in
at the end of the day

421
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:42,797
and he comes to see how you done,
you ain't gonna look in his eyes.

422
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:46,833
You'll look at the floor because
you don't wanna see that fear in his eyes

423
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:52,318
when you grab his face and slam him
to the floor and make him cry for his life.

424
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:56,831
So you look right at the floor. Pay
attention to what I'm sayin', motherfucker.

425
00:42:57,720 --> 00:42:59,915
And then he's gonna see how you done.

426
00:43:00,040 --> 00:43:03,077
He's gonna say
"You missed a little spot over there."

427
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:07,796
"You didn't get this one here.
What about this little-bitty spot?"

428
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:13,313
And you're gonna suck all that pain inside
you and you're gonna clean that spot.

429
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:16,079
And you're gonna clean that spot

430
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:19,158
until you get that shiny clean.

431
00:43:20,680 --> 00:43:24,116
And on Friday
you'll pick up your paycheck.

432
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:25,992
And if you could do that,

433
00:43:26,120 --> 00:43:30,272
you could be president
of Chase Manhattan Corporations.

434
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:32,231
If you could do that.

435
00:43:32,920 --> 00:43:37,596
Not me, man. I wouldn't do that
kind of shit. I'd rather be in fuckin' jail.

436
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:44,030
More's the pity, youngster.
More's the pity.

437
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:46,913
Could you do that kind of shit?

438
00:43:50,840 --> 00:43:52,796
I wish I could.

439
00:44:00,280 --> 00:44:02,236
I wish I could.

440
00:44:54,560 --> 00:44:58,917
Central. Central.
Eastbound 1 2. Eastbound 1 2.

441
00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:01,713
- Barstow here.
- Why did you stop us?

442
00:45:01,840 --> 00:45:05,276
There's a runaway coming at you
on track one. Hear me?

443
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:08,710
- Number 12, answer me!
- I don't see any runaway.

444
00:45:08,840 --> 00:45:11,877
If you were close enough to see her,
you'd be dead. Get it?

445
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:18,109
She's four miles away. I want you to pull
onto track two at once. Repeat, at once!

446
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:19,195
My God.

447
00:45:19,320 --> 00:45:21,470
(giggling) No, are you serious?

448
00:45:21,600 --> 00:45:23,795
Hey, Ruby, what's going on?

449
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:27,629
- Hey, hey, you can't go in there right now.
- Come on, Ruby.

450
00:45:47,840 --> 00:45:49,796
(train whistle)

451
00:45:53,400 --> 00:45:57,154
That eastbound 1 2 is crawling.
Who's the incompetent bastard on her?

452
00:45:57,280 --> 00:45:59,032
Ask him to clear fast!

453
00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:08,189
=h, man.

454
00:47:11,560 --> 00:47:14,120
=h, man. =h, man.

455
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:17,437
Didn't I tell you?
I told you something was fucked up.

456
00:47:17,560 --> 00:47:23,237
- Maybe we're on some express run.
- Wake up. We blew that caboose to hell.

457
00:47:23,360 --> 00:47:27,433
Something screwy is goin' on here.
Look. Look. All the handrails are gone.

458
00:47:27,560 --> 00:47:31,473
- Maybe the engineer is croaked.
- Engineers do not just croak.

459
00:47:31,600 --> 00:47:34,637
Why don't the whistle ever blow, huh?

460
00:47:36,040 --> 00:47:38,429
What are you, out of your mind?

461
00:47:38,560 --> 00:47:43,270
I just wanted to see if it worked.
You said the engineer was croak...

462
00:47:44,640 --> 00:47:46,596
Let go.

463
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:53,713
- You think it's a cops-and-robbers game.
- Hey, man. You picked the train.

464
00:47:55,360 --> 00:47:57,316
- You're right.
- Yeah.

465
00:48:13,360 --> 00:48:19,117
State police calling chopper one.
State police calling chopper one. Come in.

466
00:48:19,240 --> 00:48:23,631
- We have information on the escapees.
- Ranken, that's your radio.

467
00:48:25,480 --> 00:48:28,995
Railroad security found some
prison clothes in a switch yard.

468
00:48:29,120 --> 00:48:31,190
Looks like prison brogans.

469
00:48:31,320 --> 00:48:35,359
- How'd they get so far?
- What did I tell you?

470
00:48:35,480 --> 00:48:38,916
Tell them I'll be there in ten minutes.
Have some officers ready.

471
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:42,032
Roger, state police. We're on our way.

472
00:48:42,160 --> 00:48:44,116
Let's have some fun.

473
00:49:07,560 --> 00:49:10,358
Maybe we just oughta clear out of here.

474
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:14,519
Maybe we just oughta jump for it.
What do you say?

475
00:49:18,040 --> 00:49:21,191
We can break our necks
anytime we want.

476
00:49:25,040 --> 00:49:27,349
Yeah. That makes sense.

477
00:49:27,480 --> 00:49:30,472
- Let's find out what's happening.
- How we gonna do that?

478
00:49:30,600 --> 00:49:35,515
- Go up front and find out.
- Yeah. Find out what's happening.

479
00:49:35,640 --> 00:49:39,599
Go up front and find out
what the hell is goin' on.

480
00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:46,116
I want that, man.

481
00:49:53,880 --> 00:49:57,111
- What?
- Tuck that in on you someplace.

482
00:49:57,240 --> 00:49:58,593
All right.

483
00:49:58,720 --> 00:50:02,679
And wait till I give you the office
before you attack.

484
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:05,030
Yeah. Yeah.

485
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:08,153
=K.

486
00:50:12,600 --> 00:50:14,989
Hello, Mr MacDonald.

487
00:50:15,120 --> 00:50:19,432
Don't tell anyone about the runaway.
We don't wanna panic the passengers.

488
00:50:19,560 --> 00:50:23,553
Besides, we've got the company's
reputation to uphold. What's the latest?

489
00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:28,117
It went straight through
the caboose of Granville 1 2.

490
00:50:29,240 --> 00:50:31,674
Well, anyone hurt?

491
00:50:31,800 --> 00:50:35,759
- No. What's the story on the engineer?
- He had a heart attack - old fart.

492
00:50:35,880 --> 00:50:40,032
He made everyone bananas tryin' to keep
that engine from goin' to scrap. Get that.

493
00:50:40,160 --> 00:50:42,754
- What's the speed?
- About 70.

494
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:47,037
Hey, Barstow, why don't you stop her?

495
00:50:47,160 --> 00:50:51,312
You put the system in.
Cost the company $4.5 million.

496
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:56,753
The system is designed to dispatch trains,
not to stop them when they're unmanned.

497
00:50:56,880 --> 00:51:01,795
The brakes are out, the overspeed control
must've gotten screwed up by the crash.

498
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:05,435
But don't worry, Eddie. We'll do
all we can to avoid more casualties.

499
00:51:05,560 --> 00:51:10,156
- Don't forget about the Seneca bridge.
- Dave, get us some coffee.

500
00:51:10,280 --> 00:51:13,192
- What about the bridge?
- I'm taking care of it.

501
00:51:13,320 --> 00:51:18,678
- I'd like to remind you it's an old bridge.
- So what? Are you gonna get the coffee?

502
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:23,476
Mr MacDonald, by the time that runaway
reaches this bridge, it'll be doin' 90.

503
00:51:23,600 --> 00:51:26,160
The restriction for that bridge is 50.

504
00:51:47,360 --> 00:51:50,591
- Get her on the spur in Jordan. Derail her.
- Best idea, sir.

505
00:51:50,720 --> 00:51:55,794
I don't need you to tell me if I'm right!
Derail her! I don't wanna lose the bridge!

506
00:51:55,920 --> 00:51:59,595
This system is designed
so I can get everyone onto the siding.

507
00:51:59,720 --> 00:52:04,077
- Meanwhile, we'll think of something else.
- Right now it's four engines, no people.

508
00:52:04,200 --> 00:52:08,193
If I let you jerk off with your system,
this wild animal's gonna kill somebody.

509
00:52:08,320 --> 00:52:11,517
You know what
that'll cost the company? Do you?!

510
00:52:12,760 --> 00:52:14,990
Derail her. That's my order.

511
00:52:15,120 --> 00:52:17,634
You say derail, then we derail.

512
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:22,038
But these people are witnesses.
It's your decision, Eddie.

513
00:52:22,160 --> 00:52:24,594
Yeah. Yeah, it's my decision.

514
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:28,914
Central calling Jordan.
Central calling Jordan.

515
00:52:29,040 --> 00:52:31,759
Signal maintainer 40,
this is an emergency.

516
00:52:31,880 --> 00:52:35,190
Signal maintainer 40, acknowledge.
This is an emergency.

517
00:52:35,320 --> 00:52:39,074
Central calling Jordan.
Signal maintainer 40, come in.

518
00:52:39,200 --> 00:52:42,749
Where the hell are you?
Central calling Jordan.

519
00:52:42,880 --> 00:52:45,917
Jordan. Signal maintainer 40 here.

520
00:52:46,040 --> 00:52:50,272
Central here. There is an unmanned
runaway heading west on track one.

521
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:53,995
Line her into the siding. Use the
manual switch, then get out of the way.

522
00:52:54,120 --> 00:52:59,638
Superintendent MacDonald wants to
derail her. Got that? Mr Eddie MacDonald.

523
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:01,910
I'll be goddamned.

524
00:53:02,040 --> 00:53:04,395
Son of a bitch.

525
00:53:51,680 --> 00:53:53,636
- (whistle blows)
- =h!

526
00:53:56,080 --> 00:53:58,230
Hey, you hear that?

527
00:54:00,680 --> 00:54:02,875
Come on, Manny. Come on, Manny.

528
00:54:10,520 --> 00:54:16,152
See? See, I told you, man. I told you.
I knew we had an engineer on this sucker.

529
00:54:16,280 --> 00:54:19,431
- You were right, kid.
- I say blow, baby, blow!

530
00:54:32,680 --> 00:54:35,638
Boy, this is gonna be somethin'.

531
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:39,396
- (distant whistle)
- Huh?

532
00:54:44,040 --> 00:54:47,715
- Signal maintainer 40 here at Jordan.
- Central.

533
00:54:47,840 --> 00:54:52,516
Listen, did I hear you right that that
runaway is supposed to be unmanned?

534
00:54:52,640 --> 00:54:55,791
- Yeah, that's right.
- Let me tell you somethin', mister.

535
00:54:55,920 --> 00:54:57,876
I think you're wrong.

536
00:54:59,560 --> 00:55:01,039
(whistle blowing)

537
00:55:01,160 --> 00:55:04,470
The whistle!
The goddamn whistle's blowing!

538
00:55:04,600 --> 00:55:07,672
Derailing is out.un, old man, run!
Line her through!

539
00:55:10,440 --> 00:55:14,399
Somebody's blowing the whistle.
You'd have killed him just like that.

540
00:55:14,520 --> 00:55:15,475
My God!

541
00:56:18,680 --> 00:56:20,238
=K, next hurdle.

542
00:56:20,360 --> 00:56:25,115
Come on, big train.
I'll slap your fat diesel ass. Come on!

543
00:57:00,920 --> 00:57:03,434
D'you like 'em - anchovies?

544
00:57:05,880 --> 00:57:08,235
I don't remember havin' any.

545
00:57:09,480 --> 00:57:15,112
Well, if you had 'em, you'd remember
having 'em, man. I tell you what.

546
00:57:17,240 --> 00:57:19,595
- Get over here.
- Yeah. What?

547
00:57:23,320 --> 00:57:27,632
- I don't think he saw us.
- =K. =K. What do we do now?

548
00:57:27,760 --> 00:57:32,436
Let him come. When he gets two-thirds
through that door, we'll nail him.

549
00:57:32,560 --> 00:57:34,357
Uh...

550
00:57:34,480 --> 00:57:36,869
- We ain't gonna kill him, are we?
- No.

551
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:38,956
=K.

552
00:57:39,080 --> 00:57:41,389
Unless we have to.

553
00:57:41,520 --> 00:57:43,750
We'll find out what's goin' on.

554
00:57:43,880 --> 00:57:46,314
Yeah. Yeah, that makes sense.

555
00:57:49,640 --> 00:57:51,596
=h, man.

556
00:57:54,240 --> 00:57:56,800
He's in trouble out there.
Let's help him.

557
00:57:56,920 --> 00:57:59,673
Come on. Let's go help him, Manny.

558
00:58:24,040 --> 00:58:25,996
Down!

559
00:58:30,600 --> 00:58:32,556
=h, man.

560
00:58:38,240 --> 00:58:40,595
What are you doin' here?

561
00:58:40,720 --> 00:58:43,188
What am I doing here?
I work on this train.

562
00:58:43,320 --> 00:58:45,993
- What are you doing here?
- What are we doin' here?

563
00:58:46,120 --> 00:58:48,111
I'll tell you what we're doin' here.

564
00:58:48,240 --> 00:58:53,678
We're on our way to Las Vegas to see our
close and personal friend, Wayne Newton.

565
00:58:53,800 --> 00:58:58,157
Why? Are you collecting tickets
or somethin', sweetheart?

566
00:58:58,280 --> 00:59:02,751
Hey, sweetheart, how would you like
a really good fuck, huh?

567
00:59:02,880 --> 00:59:04,836
Just try it. Just try it!

568
00:59:04,960 --> 00:59:06,996
Freeze on that bullshit.

569
00:59:11,600 --> 00:59:13,716
What happened to you?

570
00:59:13,840 --> 00:59:16,559
I was tired. I was taking a nap.

571
00:59:17,240 --> 00:59:20,437
I shouldn't have done it, but I did it.
So what?

572
00:59:20,560 --> 00:59:23,552
My head got hit
when we slammed into that caboose.

573
00:59:23,680 --> 00:59:28,674
I don't know what happened, but there's
no engineer on this train. Nobody but us.

574
00:59:28,800 --> 00:59:31,997
- She's lyin'. We heard the whistle.
- I blew the whistle!

575
00:59:32,120 --> 00:59:33,997
You're tryin' to get us busted.

576
00:59:34,120 --> 00:59:36,759
This runaway's gonna
run into something fast.

577
00:59:36,880 --> 00:59:41,954
I climbed back here to the last engine
where it's safer. Don't you get it?

578
00:59:44,920 --> 00:59:48,799
- I don't believe her bullshit.
- You don't believe me?

579
00:59:49,880 --> 00:59:54,715
You just look out the window, you don't
believe me. This train is out of control.

580
00:59:54,840 --> 00:59:57,400
My God, we can get killed.

581
01:00:03,840 --> 01:00:06,957
Then we'd better do somethin' about it.

582
01:00:07,080 --> 01:00:09,196
What about the hostler helper?

583
01:00:09,320 --> 01:00:10,912
A woman. Goddammit.

584
01:00:11,040 --> 01:00:13,952
Does she know anything
about running a locomotive?

585
01:00:14,080 --> 01:00:16,514
Shit!

586
01:00:16,640 --> 01:00:21,873
The only person on the whole train
is a woman. How lucky can I get?

587
01:00:27,840 --> 01:00:31,594
- Now what?
- The chief of security from Stonehaven.

588
01:00:31,720 --> 01:00:34,473
- I don't have time for him.
- He says it's important.

589
01:00:34,600 --> 01:00:36,989
- He know about the runaway?
- I don't think so.

590
01:00:37,120 --> 01:00:39,236
Good. Tell him we'll see him later.

591
01:00:39,360 --> 01:00:42,670
- How far to the bridge? What's the ETA?
- 25 minutes.

592
01:00:42,800 --> 01:00:44,552
Shit.

593
01:00:48,040 --> 01:00:49,996
- Seneca station.
- Go ahead.

594
01:00:50,120 --> 01:00:53,590
MacDonald from Central. A runaway's
coming your way. Going over 80.

595
01:00:53,720 --> 01:00:57,429
- That's too fast for the bridge.
- I know it's going too fast.

596
01:00:57,560 --> 01:01:01,314
- Have your emergency crew together.
- Christ! Can't you stop it?

597
01:01:01,440 --> 01:01:05,069
We're gonna stop it.
Have 'em there just in case.

598
01:01:05,200 --> 01:01:06,758
Asshole.

599
01:01:18,920 --> 01:01:20,876
It won't do a thing.

600
01:01:21,840 --> 01:01:22,829
Agh!

601
01:01:22,960 --> 01:01:25,679
- I already tried it from the second engine.
- Why not?

602
01:01:25,800 --> 01:01:28,951
All I know is when a bunch
of engines are hooked up together

603
01:01:29,080 --> 01:01:35,599
everything operates from the lead engine -
you stop the lead engine, all of 'em stop.

604
01:01:37,400 --> 01:01:39,277
I don't believe this shit!

605
01:01:39,400 --> 01:01:41,789
We get out of a maximum security prison

606
01:01:41,920 --> 01:01:46,232
and wind up on an unmanned train
with this bitch and bad news.

607
01:01:46,360 --> 01:01:49,716
- You guys bust out of Stonehaven?
- Yeah. So what?

608
01:01:49,840 --> 01:01:52,559
Man, why'd you tell her that?

609
01:01:52,680 --> 01:01:54,796
You told her, clown.

610
01:01:54,920 --> 01:01:58,196
- So what? She gonna drop a dime on us?
- No.

611
01:01:59,440 --> 01:02:03,069
Boy, I guess you guys
picked the wrong train.

612
01:02:07,760 --> 01:02:11,992
How come you didn't go up to the lead
engine? How come you come back here?

613
01:02:12,120 --> 01:02:16,875
You can't cross from the second to
the first engine. It doesn't have a walkway.

614
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:20,470
There's a door in front,
but it must've jammed in the collision.

615
01:02:20,600 --> 01:02:24,229
=h, man. What do we do now?

616
01:02:24,360 --> 01:02:30,117
- You think they know about us?
- They do now, after we hit that caboose.

617
01:02:31,160 --> 01:02:36,280
If they woke up, there'd be pigs all over
this thing whenever and wherever it stops.

618
01:02:36,400 --> 01:02:40,757
- Ranken's all over this territory.
- Yeah. Maybe he'll find us.

619
01:02:46,240 --> 01:02:52,270
I ain't givin' up. No matter who dies, I ain't
givin' him that pleasure. No fuckin' way.

620
01:02:52,400 --> 01:02:54,516
I don't wanna die, Manny.

621
01:02:54,640 --> 01:02:57,234
I ain't gettin' caught alive.

622
01:03:01,680 --> 01:03:04,114
And you neither.

623
01:03:05,560 --> 01:03:07,516
I don't know, man.

624
01:03:08,560 --> 01:03:13,475
I don't know nothin' right now.
I can't even think straight right now.

625
01:03:18,240 --> 01:03:21,710
Just do what I tell you
and don't crap on yourself.

626
01:03:21,840 --> 01:03:26,197
I let you tag along to be a regular,
not a piece of shit.

627
01:03:52,360 --> 01:03:58,390
What you're doin' ain't nothin', man.
We don't stand a chance if we jump out.

628
01:03:58,520 --> 01:04:02,069
I can't jump here. This is suicide.

629
01:04:02,200 --> 01:04:06,273
If you jump here, you're gonna break
every bone in your body. Then what?

630
01:04:06,400 --> 01:04:09,836
- They've been broke before.
- I'm with you, Manny.

631
01:04:09,960 --> 01:04:12,997
I'm with you till the wheels come off.

632
01:04:16,880 --> 01:04:18,518
- You can't go!
- No?

633
01:04:18,640 --> 01:04:22,792
- You can't leave me alone here.
- I don't care who jumps with me.

634
01:04:24,880 --> 01:04:27,110
I know how to stop the train!

635
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:33,437
- Why didn't you tell us that to start with?
- We probably can't stop it 100%,

636
01:04:33,560 --> 01:04:36,632
- but maybe we can slow it down.
- You tell me how.

637
01:04:36,760 --> 01:04:41,356
If we can disconnect the electric cables
between the engines,

638
01:04:41,480 --> 01:04:43,789
the engines'll shut down one at a time.

639
01:04:43,920 --> 01:04:47,196
Now, it's not gonna be easy. We...

640
01:04:47,320 --> 01:04:50,073
They'll be frozen
and we don't have the right tools,

641
01:04:50,200 --> 01:04:53,636
but it's a better chance than jumping out.

642
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:58,709
You better know what you're talkin' about.

643
01:04:58,840 --> 01:05:02,674
Don't threaten me.
What's the matter with you?

644
01:05:04,520 --> 01:05:06,476
Come on, let's go.

645
01:05:17,600 --> 01:05:19,238
That one.

646
01:05:19,360 --> 01:05:23,399
- The one next to the coupling?
- Yeah. Here.

647
01:05:49,760 --> 01:05:51,716
Take me up.

648
01:05:55,880 --> 01:05:58,394
You do it. You have two hands.

649
01:05:58,520 --> 01:06:02,069
- =K. Hold on to me.
- Use the wrench.

650
01:06:39,200 --> 01:06:41,350
Hey, I did it! I got it!

651
01:06:41,480 --> 01:06:44,517
Get me up. Get me up.
I got it!

652
01:06:48,480 --> 01:06:51,677
- Frank, look at this. Come look at this.
- Look at what?

653
01:06:51,800 --> 01:06:54,519
The runaway has slowed down.

654
01:06:54,640 --> 01:06:58,553
- See? It's at 80, and still holding.
- It was 92 a couple of minutes ago.

655
01:06:58,680 --> 01:07:01,353
- I don't understand it.
- The girl. She slowed it.

656
01:07:01,480 --> 01:07:06,076
It doesn't matter. 80, 180. The bridge
won't take the train goin' that fast.

657
01:07:06,200 --> 01:07:09,317
- How far to the bridge now?
- Five minutes.

658
01:07:28,600 --> 01:07:30,352
- Let's go.
- Right.

659
01:07:30,480 --> 01:07:34,837
- We can use the fire extinguisher.
- Right.ight.

660
01:08:08,480 --> 01:08:10,436
I lost it!

661
01:08:13,280 --> 01:08:16,750
She's coming!
ETA's in about three minutes!

662
01:08:24,840 --> 01:08:26,796
Get me up.

663
01:08:29,720 --> 01:08:31,073
Argh!

664
01:08:31,200 --> 01:08:33,634
Manny! Manny!
Get her, man. Get her!

665
01:08:33,760 --> 01:08:36,228
Argh!

666
01:08:36,360 --> 01:08:39,477
I got you. Hold my hand. Hold my hand!

667
01:08:40,960 --> 01:08:44,714
Grab my hand! Come on.

668
01:08:53,720 --> 01:08:55,472
(distant rumbling)

669
01:09:13,040 --> 01:09:14,996
Look! Look!

670
01:09:24,960 --> 01:09:27,838
Manny! Look, Manny! Look!

671
01:09:38,480 --> 01:09:40,232
Get me Central, quick.

672
01:09:54,680 --> 01:09:56,636
=h, man. =h, man.

673
01:10:01,400 --> 01:10:05,075
That's crazy.
There are three people on the runaway.

674
01:10:05,200 --> 01:10:07,589
Holy shit.
Where'd they come from?

675
01:10:07,720 --> 01:10:11,269
- How do I know? We saved three lives.
- (beeping)

676
01:10:11,400 --> 01:10:14,631
- Not for long.
- Dave, will you give me a fucking break?

677
01:10:14,760 --> 01:10:19,390
I wish I could, but we've got five minutes
to get the runaway off the main line,

678
01:10:19,520 --> 01:10:22,273
or there'll be a head-on
with the Northeast Express.

679
01:10:22,400 --> 01:10:25,233
It's no big deal.
We'll just head her into the 14.

680
01:10:25,360 --> 01:10:28,477
Great idea, Frank.
Why don't you just send her to Elken's?

681
01:10:28,600 --> 01:10:31,068
- So?
- No, no, no. That's the chemical plant.

682
01:10:31,200 --> 01:10:36,433
- She won't make the curve at that speed.
- She'll flip and wipe out the whole plant.

683
01:10:36,560 --> 01:10:38,471
We'd better warn 'em.

684
01:10:59,520 --> 01:11:03,069
You know, girl, I oughta thank you.

685
01:11:03,200 --> 01:11:08,069
I mean, it's one thing to jump and
wrap yourself around a tree or a pole.

686
01:11:08,200 --> 01:11:14,514
But to wind up spilt all over a ditch
with a broken hip waitin' for the bulls,

687
01:11:14,640 --> 01:11:16,392
what a waste.

688
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:21,434
Yeah, man. You ain't kiddin'.

689
01:11:23,480 --> 01:11:25,948
Hey, look. We're almost there.

690
01:11:26,080 --> 01:11:29,038
Come on, Manny. Let's rip this fucker.

691
01:11:29,160 --> 01:11:32,277
- Is that the door?
- It's jammed. I couldn't open it.

692
01:11:32,400 --> 01:11:39,351
Hey, don't you worry, sweetheart. We've
been breakin' through doors all our lives.

693
01:11:43,160 --> 01:11:47,153
Come on, man. You can't do it
with that hand of yours. Let me help.

694
01:11:56,720 --> 01:11:58,870
- Let me in there.
- I got it!

695
01:12:01,480 --> 01:12:04,119
You can't do it with that hand of yours.

696
01:12:11,600 --> 01:12:13,670
Shit.

697
01:12:13,800 --> 01:12:15,836
Shit.

698
01:12:15,960 --> 01:12:17,916
Bullshit.

699
01:12:28,520 --> 01:12:32,274
Take the first west at Macketsburg.
Get onto the Bellport siding.

700
01:12:32,400 --> 01:12:37,554
Get the emergency crew in and evacuate
the plant. Get 'em as far away as possible.

701
01:12:37,680 --> 01:12:41,912
You got ten minutes, if you're lucky.
Get off my back, woman!

702
01:12:43,040 --> 01:12:46,874
Mr Barstow, I have two
very dangerous prisoners on the loose.

703
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:49,468
I don't give a shit
if your whole prison's loose.

704
01:12:49,600 --> 01:12:54,879
I got a killer train on my hands with three
people on board, and no free tracks left.

705
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:58,879
So do me a fucking favour and get lost,
or I'll have your ass kicked out!

706
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:00,956
=n the double!

707
01:13:04,160 --> 01:13:07,914
You keep an eye on her.
I'm gonna go take a leak.

708
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:15,956
(sighs)

709
01:13:22,640 --> 01:13:24,596
Argh!

710
01:13:32,680 --> 01:13:37,231
I hope you don't like it
and want to do something about it.

711
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:44,438
Yeah, I didn't think you wanted
to back up that loud conversation.

712
01:13:50,240 --> 01:13:55,109
Wipe that piss off your face. I don't
wanna hear any more crap out of you.

713
01:13:56,120 --> 01:14:00,238
If I don't get my convicts back,
the prison will be out of control.

714
01:14:00,360 --> 01:14:05,480
You know what a riot
in a maximum security prison looks like?

715
01:14:11,640 --> 01:14:14,234
Your brains are too small to imagine it.

716
01:14:15,320 --> 01:14:17,515
- Now, where's the train?
- Track one.

717
01:14:17,640 --> 01:14:22,191
I'm gonna kick your teeth in. You're
playing with me. Tell me straight. Got it?

718
01:14:22,320 --> 01:14:25,915
- Tell me how to find it with a helicopter.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

719
01:14:26,040 --> 01:14:27,996
I'll show you.

720
01:15:43,920 --> 01:15:50,155
I'll be goddamned if I've come all this way
to get stuck by some goddamn door! Shit!

721
01:15:50,280 --> 01:15:52,999
Don't give up now.
We're gonna make it through this.

722
01:15:53,120 --> 01:15:54,872
How?

723
01:15:58,720 --> 01:16:01,518
- I don't know.
- Yeah.

724
01:16:01,640 --> 01:16:05,599
But I know the people
are clearing the tracks,

725
01:16:05,720 --> 01:16:08,757
and I know that they won't abandon us.

726
01:16:13,280 --> 01:16:17,159
- How do you know that?
- I just feel it in my heart.

727
01:16:17,280 --> 01:16:19,510
There are miracles.

728
01:16:19,640 --> 01:16:22,029
You're stupid.
You know how stupid you sound?

729
01:16:22,160 --> 01:16:27,553
Miracle, my ass.
=ne must count on oneself. Nobody else.

730
01:16:27,680 --> 01:16:31,958
You think I'm waitin' around for a miracle
to happen? I ain't waitin' for no miracle.

731
01:16:32,080 --> 01:16:34,674
I'm goin' out and around. =ut and around.

732
01:16:34,800 --> 01:16:38,076
I'm goin' there. That's where I'm goin'.

733
01:16:39,200 --> 01:16:42,476
You can't make it.
There's nothing to hold on to out there.

734
01:16:42,600 --> 01:16:46,752
There's no walkways.
I told you, you can't make it.

735
01:16:50,640 --> 01:16:51,993
I'll make it.

736
01:16:52,120 --> 01:16:57,672
If I have to fly the five feet,
like a birdie, I'll fly it. I'll make it.

737
01:16:59,600 --> 01:17:03,309
Hey, Manny, you can't do it,
not with that arm of yours.

738
01:17:03,440 --> 01:17:06,512
But I can do it.
I can whip this fucker.

739
01:17:07,240 --> 01:17:10,835
So, give me a drink. Let me go for it.

740
01:17:12,640 --> 01:17:13,789
All right!

741
01:17:13,920 --> 01:17:16,673
Hey, sucker. Lighten up.

742
01:17:16,800 --> 01:17:18,358
=oh.

743
01:17:22,960 --> 01:17:25,793
- You are so brave.
- Yeah, I know it.

744
01:17:29,680 --> 01:17:31,875
=K. =K.

745
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:35,515
Goggles. Yeah, goggles.

746
01:17:35,640 --> 01:17:37,471
I'm going.

747
01:17:37,600 --> 01:17:39,716
Here I go.

748
01:17:48,520 --> 01:17:50,715
Hey, Manny?

749
01:17:50,840 --> 01:17:52,398
Partners?

750
01:17:52,520 --> 01:17:54,272
Yeah.

751
01:17:57,560 --> 01:17:59,516
Fuckin' A.

752
01:18:00,440 --> 01:18:02,192
Fuckin' A.

753
01:18:02,320 --> 01:18:04,515
=K. =K.

754
01:18:15,560 --> 01:18:19,712
You can make it. You can make it, Buck.
You got guts, kid.

755
01:18:25,880 --> 01:18:28,917
You got real guts.
More guts than brains.

756
01:18:29,040 --> 01:18:32,077
- What did you say?
- No brains. No brains.

757
01:18:32,200 --> 01:18:34,953
- That's mean.
- That's the truth.

758
01:18:42,400 --> 01:18:45,472
Come on, Buck.
Let's go. Let's go, sucker.

759
01:19:07,600 --> 01:19:10,353
- Now! Make it now! Jump for it!
- He's gotta come back.

760
01:19:10,480 --> 01:19:12,869
- Go for it, sucker. Come on.
- I can't watch.

761
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:14,956
Then... sit down!

762
01:19:21,120 --> 01:19:22,951
Don't give up on me, sucker.

763
01:19:31,520 --> 01:19:33,795
Come on! Come on! Come on! Come on!

764
01:19:38,320 --> 01:19:42,871
Don't give up. Aagh.
Don't quit, sucker. Get out there!

765
01:19:45,640 --> 01:19:49,952
He can't do it. Don't you care about him?
Doesn't his life mean anything to you?

766
01:19:50,080 --> 01:19:52,036
- Get outta here!
- Agh!

767
01:19:56,840 --> 01:20:01,994
Get back, punk. You wanna be a tough
guy? You want a deal like this? Go back!

768
01:20:04,520 --> 01:20:06,476
Let him in!

769
01:20:11,920 --> 01:20:16,596
- What are you doin', Manny?
- Show me you ain't got shit for blood!

770
01:20:16,720 --> 01:20:19,154
- Give me a break.
- =h-ho.

771
01:20:19,280 --> 01:20:21,236
Get out there now.

772
01:20:22,360 --> 01:20:26,069
Don't you talk to me.
I don't know who you are.

773
01:20:26,200 --> 01:20:29,317
You wanna be a tough guy?
Get the fuck outta here. Get out.

774
01:20:29,440 --> 01:20:33,592
- No! No! Stop it!
- You wanna kill me, or what?

775
01:20:33,720 --> 01:20:36,280
If I wanted to punch your ticket,
you'd be long gone.

776
01:20:36,400 --> 01:20:39,119
You can do it.
I'm tellin' you you can do it.

777
01:20:39,240 --> 01:20:41,993
I can't do it, Manny. I can't do it.

778
01:20:42,120 --> 01:20:45,954
You don't know what you could do,
what you can't.

779
01:20:46,080 --> 01:20:48,958
You're a coward.
Why'd I break out with a chicken? Get up.

780
01:20:49,080 --> 01:20:52,356
- Leave him alone.
- Show me some, kid.

781
01:20:52,480 --> 01:20:54,675
- Get the fuck up. You hear me?
- Stop it!

782
01:20:54,800 --> 01:20:56,950
Get the fuck up.

783
01:20:57,080 --> 01:20:58,718
No! No!

784
01:20:58,840 --> 01:21:00,717
Get the fuck outta here!

785
01:21:00,840 --> 01:21:02,956
- =K.
- No.

786
01:21:03,080 --> 01:21:06,072
- =K.
- No. No.

787
01:21:06,200 --> 01:21:08,191
=K.

788
01:21:08,320 --> 01:21:10,356
=K. =K. I'm goin'.

789
01:21:10,480 --> 01:21:13,677
No. No, he's using you.
He's using you. Don't go!

790
01:21:13,800 --> 01:21:15,916
- You gonna do what I tell you?
- Yeah.

791
01:21:16,040 --> 01:21:19,316
- You're gonna do it.
- Do it yourself, if you're so brave.

792
01:21:19,440 --> 01:21:22,034
- I would if I had two hands.
- Bullshit!

793
01:21:22,160 --> 01:21:25,835
You think you can sacrifice
someone else's life instead of your own?

794
01:21:25,960 --> 01:21:27,916
You're an animal.

795
01:21:28,760 --> 01:21:31,399
No. Worse.

796
01:21:31,520 --> 01:21:33,078
Human.

797
01:21:33,200 --> 01:21:35,156
Human!

798
01:21:35,280 --> 01:21:39,717
Get the fuck out there. Now.
Get out! Do it! Get out!

799
01:21:41,280 --> 01:21:44,158
I'm not letting you go.
No! No!

800
01:21:44,280 --> 01:21:45,872
Argh!

801
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:47,956
Don't you touch her!

802
01:21:55,400 --> 01:21:57,516
I'll kill you, Manny. I'll kill you.

803
01:21:57,640 --> 01:22:01,030
- You die, sucker. You die.
- I'll kill you, Manny.

804
01:22:01,160 --> 01:22:04,072
Don't make me kill you. I'll kill you.

805
01:22:06,760 --> 01:22:10,036
I'll kill you, Manny.
Don't make me kill you. I'll kill you.

806
01:22:10,160 --> 01:22:11,559
Come at me, I'll kill you.

807
01:22:11,680 --> 01:22:13,159
Aaargh!

808
01:22:14,080 --> 01:22:15,957
Aaargh!

809
01:22:16,080 --> 01:22:19,436
Drop the shiv. Don't make me kill you.
I'll beat you to fuckin' death.

810
01:22:19,560 --> 01:22:21,994
Come on, Manny. Try me. Try me!

811
01:22:24,480 --> 01:22:26,232
Kill him!

812
01:22:26,360 --> 01:22:28,316
Kill him! Kill him!

813
01:22:29,520 --> 01:22:31,476
Kill him!

814
01:23:32,080 --> 01:23:34,036
=h, Manny...

815
01:23:35,040 --> 01:23:37,270
I thought you was my friend.

816
01:23:39,320 --> 01:23:41,834
I thought we was partners.

817
01:23:44,360 --> 01:23:46,316
Shit.

818
01:23:46,440 --> 01:23:51,230
You know, you're worse than Ranken,
when the truth comes out.

819
01:23:51,840 --> 01:23:54,229
At least he's upfront with his bullshit.

820
01:23:56,920 --> 01:23:59,195
You was a hero.

821
01:24:01,880 --> 01:24:07,591
You was a hero to all of us
back in that shithole.

822
01:24:07,720 --> 01:24:09,676
Goddamn.

823
01:24:12,080 --> 01:24:14,310
=h, Manny.

824
01:24:17,320 --> 01:24:18,673
Manny...

825
01:24:35,240 --> 01:24:38,789
It's your mess, Frank. You should've
listened to me and derailed her.

826
01:24:38,920 --> 01:24:44,677
What do we do? Shunt 'em onto the siding
and in 1 5 minutes they run out of track?

827
01:24:44,800 --> 01:24:47,473
- Elken station. Elken station!
- Elken. Go ahead.

828
01:24:47,600 --> 01:24:51,479
- Gilchrist, this is MacDonald.
- Yes, MacDonald.

829
01:24:51,600 --> 01:24:53,158
- Barstow here.
- Come on.

830
01:24:53,280 --> 01:24:55,555
Now listen carefully and act fast.

831
01:24:55,680 --> 01:24:59,958
You have about one minute
to line the runaway under the old spur.

832
01:25:00,080 --> 01:25:03,595
- You got it.
- Good, good, good. Good boy.

833
01:25:03,720 --> 01:25:06,678
We'll save the chemical plant, huh?

834
01:25:08,200 --> 01:25:10,634
We're still gonna lose those three people.

835
01:26:44,560 --> 01:26:50,999
(TV) There are still a lot of beaming faces
at NASA headquarters in Houston today

836
01:26:51,120 --> 01:26:55,989
over Wednesday's successful launch
of the two new communications satellites.

837
01:26:56,120 --> 01:27:00,033
The number of sophisticated experiments
will apparently be doubled

838
01:27:00,160 --> 01:27:04,950
on next month's launch
of an Anglo-French weather satellite.

839
01:27:05,080 --> 01:27:09,676
Launch director Hogan praised the crew
of the just-completed mission...

840
01:27:09,800 --> 01:27:12,439
I still don't understand.

841
01:27:12,560 --> 01:27:14,949
How did this happen?

842
01:27:15,080 --> 01:27:19,278
Why couldn't we stop it,
with all this junk?

843
01:27:19,400 --> 01:27:22,710
I mean, with all this high technology.

844
01:27:27,440 --> 01:27:29,874
Some things can't be explained.

845
01:28:57,240 --> 01:28:59,117
(helicopter overhead)

846
01:29:02,560 --> 01:29:04,516
Look!

847
01:29:37,280 --> 01:29:38,838
Holy shit.

848
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:48,798
See that, Ranken? You see that?

849
01:29:52,960 --> 01:29:55,554
Come on, Ranken!

850
01:30:48,040 --> 01:30:53,478
You'll never take me back, Ranken. Try it.
You're never gonna be allowed, sucker.

851
01:30:53,600 --> 01:30:59,630
What's the matter, Ranken? You got no
fuckin' guts? No guts. No guts, Ranken.

852
01:30:59,760 --> 01:31:03,514
You hear me? You'll never stop this train,
you hear me, Ranken?

853
01:31:03,640 --> 01:31:06,791
You'll never stop it.
You hear me, sucker?

854
01:31:06,920 --> 01:31:11,198
I told you. You hear me, Ranken?
I told you I'd break free. I done it.

855
01:31:11,320 --> 01:31:14,949
Here I am, right in your face, sucker.
Come on down.

856
01:31:15,080 --> 01:31:18,117
I won! I won!

857
01:31:18,240 --> 01:31:23,997
I want you down, Ranken. Come on down.
I'm alive, sucker. Come on down, Ranken.

858
01:31:27,600 --> 01:31:31,991
Ranken, you hear me? You hear me?
You'll never get me.

859
01:31:32,120 --> 01:31:35,635
You'll never stop this train.
Never. Never! You understand?

860
01:31:35,760 --> 01:31:39,116
I won. I won! I won!

861
01:32:10,040 --> 01:32:12,395
What was that? What was that?

862
01:32:13,200 --> 01:32:15,236
Huh?

863
01:32:15,360 --> 01:32:19,273
- What happened? What happened?
- They gave up on us.

864
01:32:19,400 --> 01:32:22,073
They switched us off the main track
onto a dead end.

865
01:32:22,200 --> 01:32:26,557
- What does that mean?
- We're gonna crash any minute.

866
01:32:27,760 --> 01:32:29,512
Uh-huh.

867
01:32:51,320 --> 01:32:53,276
Hold me.

868
01:32:55,240 --> 01:32:57,196
I don't wanna die alone.

869
01:32:59,200 --> 01:33:01,953
We're gonna be all right.
We're gonna be fine.

870
01:33:02,080 --> 01:33:04,594
(chuckles) We all die alone.
Come on, Ranken.

871
01:33:04,960 --> 01:33:09,476
Come on, sucker, here I am.
Come on. I'm out of my cage now.

872
01:33:09,600 --> 01:33:14,390
I'm out, out of my cage.
I'm never going back. Never.

873
01:33:14,520 --> 01:33:18,035
You'll never stop me. Never!
I'm out. You hear me?

874
01:33:18,160 --> 01:33:23,109
- You can't get across, Manny.
- I'm out of my cage. You'll never stop me.

875
01:33:28,760 --> 01:33:31,320
You're gonna learn, kid.

876
01:33:31,440 --> 01:33:33,396
It's all up here.

877
01:33:34,560 --> 01:33:37,393
I'll cross the stinking thing!

878
01:33:37,520 --> 01:33:40,080
I'll cross it! I'll cross it!

879
01:33:41,480 --> 01:33:43,835
Watch me.

880
01:34:49,680 --> 01:34:52,240
Aaaaargh!

881
01:36:21,840 --> 01:36:23,478
Waitin' for ya.

882
01:37:05,120 --> 01:37:07,236
Is Jonah alive?

883
01:37:07,480 --> 01:37:09,914
Is Jonah alive?

884
01:37:10,040 --> 01:37:11,996
Yes. Yes!

885
01:37:16,240 --> 01:37:18,196
That's good.

886
01:37:19,160 --> 01:37:21,116
He'll be glad.

887
01:37:40,720 --> 01:37:42,517
Don't do it, Manny.

888
01:37:42,640 --> 01:37:45,757
You'll burn for it. You know you will.

889
01:37:48,080 --> 01:37:51,311
Push the button.
We're on a dead-end siding.

890
01:37:51,440 --> 01:37:54,273
We're gonna crash in five minutes.

891
01:37:58,640 --> 01:38:02,792
Then we'll have a nice
five-minute ride together.

892
01:38:08,920 --> 01:38:11,957
You think you're a hero, huh? Shit.

893
01:38:12,080 --> 01:38:14,355
You're scum.

894
01:38:14,480 --> 01:38:16,436
We're both scum, brother.

895
01:38:45,440 --> 01:38:49,672
You're going to push that button
and stop this train!

896
01:38:49,800 --> 01:38:52,030
We've only got a few minutes!

897
01:38:52,160 --> 01:38:54,230
We got all the time in the world.

898
01:38:55,160 --> 01:38:58,709
- You'll die, bastard.
- You'll die with me.

899
01:39:02,640 --> 01:39:04,596
Fuck you.

900
01:39:04,720 --> 01:39:07,757
You're as afraid to die as anybody else.

901
01:39:07,880 --> 01:39:11,111
And I never let you free, you hear me?

902
01:39:13,080 --> 01:39:15,036
I am free, Ranken.

903
01:39:16,280 --> 01:39:18,236
I am free.

904
01:39:20,120 --> 01:39:22,156
You think you won.

905
01:39:24,800 --> 01:39:27,360
I know how to die too.

906
01:39:28,560 --> 01:39:31,916
Win, lose. What's the difference?

907
01:39:39,000 --> 01:39:41,958
What about that punk and the girl?

908
01:39:48,680 --> 01:39:50,352
No, no.

909
01:39:50,480 --> 01:39:52,436
It's just you and me.

910
01:40:50,080 --> 01:40:52,275
Manny! Shut it down!

911
01:40:52,400 --> 01:40:55,676
Manny, goddammit!
Shut it down, Manny!

912
01:40:55,800 --> 01:41:00,078
Manny! Shut it down!
That's all you gotta do! Manny!

913
01:41:00,200 --> 01:41:02,430
He knows what he wants to do.

914
01:41:02,560 --> 01:41:06,314
Manny! Shut it down!
That's all you gotta do!

915
01:41:06,440 --> 01:41:09,398
Shut it down, Manny!
Shut it down!

916
01:41:12,160 --> 01:41:16,392
Shut it down, goddammit!
That's all you gotta do, Manny!

917
01:41:16,520 --> 01:41:19,876
Shut it down! Manny!

918
01:41:29,720 --> 01:41:31,676
He did it.

919
01:41:32,520 --> 01:41:34,078
He did it.

920
