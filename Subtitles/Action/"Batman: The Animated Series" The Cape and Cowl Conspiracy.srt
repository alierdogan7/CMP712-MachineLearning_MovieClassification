1
00:01:27,028 --> 00:01:29,019
It's about time.

2
00:01:37,805 --> 00:01:40,035
Good morning, Hill.

3
00:01:41,276 --> 00:01:43,972
- Good morning...
- Fugate.

4
00:01:44,145 --> 00:01:45,976
Temple Fugate?

5
00:01:46,147 --> 00:01:49,116
I should think you'd
remember the name by now, counselor.

6
00:01:49,284 --> 00:01:52,276
We've only been taking the same train
every day for...

7
00:01:52,453 --> 00:01:56,014
...one year, seven months and 13 days.

8
00:01:56,658 --> 00:01:59,126
Right. The efficiency expert.

9
00:02:00,561 --> 00:02:03,621
Six minutes behind schedule.

10
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:08,501
You seem pretty tightly wound
this morning, Fugate.

11
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:11,036
I have an important court hearing today.

12
00:02:11,205 --> 00:02:14,368
There's been a $20 million judgment
against my company.

13
00:02:14,542 --> 00:02:16,066
My attorney has appealed.

14
00:02:16,244 --> 00:02:19,805
But if we lose, it's the end of everything.

15
00:02:20,014 --> 00:02:22,141
Temple, let me give you some advice.

16
00:02:22,317 --> 00:02:25,218
I'm a lawyer.
Trust me, I know these things.

17
00:02:25,386 --> 00:02:29,720
If that judge sees you looking
as tense and haggard as you are now...

18
00:02:29,891 --> 00:02:32,018
...he'll think you were up to something.

19
00:02:32,193 --> 00:02:35,560
Loosen up. Do something to relax
before you go into court.

20
00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:37,994
Get out of your routine
for a few minutes.

21
00:02:38,166 --> 00:02:40,259
- Do you take a coffee break?
- Of course.

22
00:02:40,435 --> 00:02:43,336
Every day at 3 on the dot.

23
00:02:43,571 --> 00:02:46,665
Then take it at 3:15.

24
00:02:47,208 --> 00:02:51,736
- But my schedule!
- Forget your schedule for one day.

25
00:02:52,613 --> 00:02:56,640
Believe me,
it will make a new man out of you.

26
00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:10,955
I needed those five minutes ago.

27
00:03:11,132 --> 00:03:13,965
- I'm sorry, sir, but...
- Thirty-seven pages?

28
00:03:14,135 --> 00:03:18,094
That would take a copier exactly
one minute and 49 seconds.

29
00:03:18,272 --> 00:03:21,867
- One more delay like this and you're fired!
- Your coffee, sir.

30
00:03:22,043 --> 00:03:23,874
And those court documents you requested.

31
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:28,549
<i>Take your coffee break at 3: 15.</i>

32
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:31,379
<i>And get out of the office.</i>

33
00:03:32,086 --> 00:03:35,214
Put that in a thermos, Ms. Perkins.

34
00:04:04,385 --> 00:04:07,616
You little brats!

35
00:04:13,127 --> 00:04:14,719
No! No!

36
00:04:14,896 --> 00:04:17,421
Don't do this to me!

37
00:04:18,633 --> 00:04:20,931
My lawyer needs those papers.

38
00:04:36,184 --> 00:04:37,913
Due to his failure to appear...

39
00:04:38,086 --> 00:04:41,021
...this court finds your client in default.

40
00:04:41,189 --> 00:04:43,953
Summary judgment against him stands...

41
00:04:44,125 --> 00:04:46,491
...at $20 million.

42
00:04:46,661 --> 00:04:49,562
No! You can't! I'll be ruined!

43
00:04:49,730 --> 00:04:54,531
Then perhaps this will teach you
to be on time for a change.

44
00:05:39,147 --> 00:05:42,708
Are you quite sure you won't
stop for breakfast, Master Bruce?

45
00:05:42,884 --> 00:05:45,682
The meals they serve at these fundraisers...

46
00:05:45,853 --> 00:05:47,252
Ghastly.

47
00:05:47,421 --> 00:05:49,912
Alfred, Mayor Hill will put out
a good spread.

48
00:05:50,091 --> 00:05:53,891
He knows you don't start a reelection
campaign by poisoning supporters.

49
00:05:58,366 --> 00:06:00,630
If he were in a hurry to get to the food...

50
00:06:00,801 --> 00:06:04,259
...he'd be ahead of us
instead of behind us.

51
00:06:12,446 --> 00:06:17,611
I take it taxi drivers are no longer required
to obey traffic signals.

52
00:06:17,785 --> 00:06:22,051
- Climb off it, geezer. You had the red.
- It's nobody's fault.

53
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:24,051
Look.

54
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,924
The traffic signals are malfunctioning.

55
00:06:30,731 --> 00:06:32,790
What the devil?

56
00:06:34,001 --> 00:06:36,492
It's the same thing all the time.

57
00:06:36,804 --> 00:06:38,635
I'll sue you.

58
00:06:46,847 --> 00:06:49,372
There's the foul-up. Mayor over-the-Hill.

59
00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:52,519
Nothing works right in this city no more.

60
00:06:52,687 --> 00:06:56,145
I fear this does not bode well
for his campaign.

61
00:06:56,324 --> 00:06:58,792
No. No, it doesn't.

62
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,951
And that may be exactly the point.

63
00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:24,518
Another piece of outlandish graffiti?

64
00:07:24,852 --> 00:07:27,446
Is this somebody's idea of a joke?

65
00:07:44,972 --> 00:07:47,998
- Hold it!
- Well, well.

66
00:07:48,175 --> 00:07:51,838
The Batman. It's about time
you showed up.

67
00:07:52,013 --> 00:07:55,710
I suppose you want to know
why I've brought downtown Gotham...

68
00:07:55,883 --> 00:07:57,748
...to a standstill, Batman.

69
00:07:58,052 --> 00:08:02,182
Well, let's just say it's because
I'm a civic-minded citizen...

70
00:08:02,356 --> 00:08:05,223
...with a lot of time on his hands.

71
00:08:17,438 --> 00:08:20,339
I want some answers, wise guy.

72
00:08:21,042 --> 00:08:23,067
- Talk!
- A pity.

73
00:08:23,244 --> 00:08:25,371
I don't know what to tell you, Batman.

74
00:08:25,613 --> 00:08:28,104
Except perhaps that the 9:15...

75
00:08:28,282 --> 00:08:32,275
...is always six minutes early.

76
00:08:50,037 --> 00:08:53,700
If the creep with the clocks
did sabotage the entire traffic system...

77
00:08:53,874 --> 00:08:56,308
...he had to have come here to do it.

78
00:08:56,744 --> 00:08:58,541
Wait here.

79
00:09:03,951 --> 00:09:09,150
My pleasure. This is one of the finest
back alleys in all of Gotham.

80
00:09:41,322 --> 00:09:42,653
What kind of saboteur...

81
00:09:42,823 --> 00:09:46,623
...uses a $6000 Metronex
to trigger a time bomb?

82
00:09:46,794 --> 00:09:49,319
A saboteur with too much money?

83
00:09:49,597 --> 00:09:52,191
Most jewelry stores register
the serial numbers...

84
00:09:52,366 --> 00:09:54,732
...of the Metronexes they sell.

85
00:09:56,937 --> 00:10:00,134
Let's see what the police database
turns up.

86
00:10:01,308 --> 00:10:05,039
"Temple Fugate. 362 Brayfogle."

87
00:10:05,212 --> 00:10:06,645
Let's go, Alfred.

88
00:10:11,452 --> 00:10:16,151
It appears Mr. Fugate's neighborhood
has seen better days.

89
00:11:02,203 --> 00:11:04,603
What is it about
that particular clock tower?

90
00:11:04,772 --> 00:11:07,707
He's got more data on it
than anything else in the city.

91
00:11:07,875 --> 00:11:09,536
There's been a slight blackout.

92
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:12,304
Just one city block,
between Schiff and Robinson.

93
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,107
West of Molldorf.

94
00:11:14,281 --> 00:11:17,114
The location of Gotham Mutual's
main branch.

95
00:11:17,318 --> 00:11:20,651
No doubt some malefactors
blacked out the bank...

96
00:11:20,821 --> 00:11:23,051
...to disable the locks on the vault.

97
00:11:23,290 --> 00:11:25,884
Yes, the time locks.

98
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:27,925
- Fugate.
- Fugate.

99
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:09,828
<i>Sorry I couldn't be with you</i>
<i>in person, Batman.</i>

100
00:12:10,004 --> 00:12:11,767
<i>But I've got a train to catch.</i>

101
00:12:11,939 --> 00:12:14,430
<i>This box contains</i>
<i>a high-speed vacuum pump.</i>

102
00:12:14,608 --> 00:12:17,406
<i>I know you've got</i>
<i>all kinds of gas masks...</i>

103
00:12:17,578 --> 00:12:19,637
<i>... so I'm putting you out of my misery...</i>

104
00:12:19,813 --> 00:12:24,011
<i>... by simply removing all the oxygen</i>
<i>from the room.</i>

105
00:12:26,954 --> 00:12:28,819
<i>The process will take 15 minutes...</i>

106
00:12:29,089 --> 00:12:31,080
<i>... which is exactly 17 minutes less...</i>

107
00:12:31,258 --> 00:12:34,318
<i>... than the time it would take</i>
<i>to burn through the door...</i>

108
00:12:34,495 --> 00:12:36,258
<i>... with that torch of yours.</i>

109
00:12:37,264 --> 00:12:40,665
<i>And I don't recommend trying to open</i>
<i>the pump's housing.</i>

110
00:12:40,834 --> 00:12:44,133
<i>It's rigged with a vibration-sensitive</i>
<i>explosive.</i>

111
00:12:44,305 --> 00:12:48,639
<i>Of course, if you want to get</i>
<i>blown to bits, that's fine with me.</i>

112
00:12:48,809 --> 00:12:52,973
<i>Either way, it's time to say</i>
adieu, <i>Batman.</i>

113
00:13:28,983 --> 00:13:31,213
This magnificent station...

114
00:13:31,385 --> 00:13:35,151
...home of the world's first
fully automated subway line...

115
00:13:35,322 --> 00:13:38,849
...is the fulfillment of my pledge to you...

116
00:13:39,026 --> 00:13:42,985
...to make our subways safer
and more efficient.

117
00:13:43,163 --> 00:13:47,065
And so I declare
Gotham Central Station...

118
00:13:47,234 --> 00:13:49,930
...officially open.

119
00:13:57,711 --> 00:14:01,078
Let the first train arrive!

120
00:14:11,458 --> 00:14:13,551
Where is it?

121
00:14:36,917 --> 00:14:39,647
What an embarrassment.

122
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:43,888
I wanted that train here
at 2:30 on the dot!

123
00:14:44,058 --> 00:14:46,822
<i>So is this what you want?</i>

124
00:14:46,994 --> 00:14:51,090
<i>A mayor who can't even get</i>
<i>a single subway train to arrive on time?</i>

125
00:14:58,172 --> 00:14:59,935
<i>Clear the platform, please.</i>

126
00:15:00,107 --> 00:15:04,510
<i>Here comes some more</i>
<i>of our mayor's incompetence.</i>

127
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:42,746
Only minor injuries. Thank God.

128
00:15:42,916 --> 00:15:44,850
Hill! Where's Hill?

129
00:16:29,730 --> 00:16:32,597
<i>And in the wake of the subway accident,</i>
<i>this grim news:</i>

130
00:16:32,766 --> 00:16:34,893
<i>Mayor Hamilton Hill has vanished.</i>

131
00:16:35,068 --> 00:16:37,468
<i>The police have no leads</i>
<i>to his whereabouts...</i>

132
00:16:37,638 --> 00:16:40,539
<i>... and they fear</i>
<i>he may have been kidnapped.</i>

133
00:16:51,585 --> 00:16:52,950
Comfortable, Hill?

134
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:55,020
Well, you won't be for long.

135
00:16:55,189 --> 00:16:59,592
At 3:15 on the dot,
those hands will come together...

136
00:16:59,793 --> 00:17:02,091
...and you'll be crushed like an insect.

137
00:17:02,362 --> 00:17:04,227
3:15, Hill.

138
00:17:04,398 --> 00:17:09,768
- Does that time hold any meaning for you?
- I don't know what you're talking about!

139
00:17:09,937 --> 00:17:14,271
You told me to take
my coffee break at 3:15.

140
00:17:14,441 --> 00:17:16,875
- What?
- You don't remember?

141
00:17:17,044 --> 00:17:19,478
My court date?

142
00:17:20,781 --> 00:17:24,114
Oh, my Lord! The lawsuit!

143
00:17:24,318 --> 00:17:27,378
Fugate, I swear I was only trying to help.

144
00:17:27,554 --> 00:17:30,216
Don't hand me that.
You did it on purpose.

145
00:17:30,390 --> 00:17:35,225
The plaintiffs were represented
by your law firm, Mr. Mayor.

146
00:17:36,063 --> 00:17:40,056
But I had nothing to do
with that case, Fugate.

147
00:17:40,334 --> 00:17:41,596
Liar!

148
00:17:41,768 --> 00:17:43,463
Not that it matters anymore...

149
00:17:43,637 --> 00:17:48,472
...now that you have an appointment
to keep at 3:15 precisely...

150
00:17:48,675 --> 00:17:51,473
...with the grim reaper!

151
00:17:58,051 --> 00:18:00,713
I'm here to clean your clock, Fugate.

152
00:18:00,888 --> 00:18:02,719
Don't count on it, Batman.

153
00:18:02,890 --> 00:18:05,552
When it comes to clocks, I am king.

154
00:18:05,726 --> 00:18:07,057
<i>En garde!</i>

155
00:18:34,821 --> 00:18:36,083
Give it up, Fugate.

156
00:18:36,256 --> 00:18:38,247
Hill committed no crime against you.

157
00:18:38,425 --> 00:18:41,917
He did worse. He made me late!

158
00:19:18,999 --> 00:19:22,662
I could do this all day, Batman,
but your time is up.

159
00:19:44,257 --> 00:19:47,454
I've studied news footage of you.
I know that it takes you...

160
00:19:47,627 --> 00:19:50,960
...exactly 1/20 of a second
to throw a punch.

161
00:19:51,131 --> 00:19:55,158
Very clever. But it only takes me
1/30 of a second...

162
00:19:55,335 --> 00:19:57,200
...to do this.

163
00:20:35,175 --> 00:20:38,144
Fugate! You can't escape!

164
00:20:38,345 --> 00:20:41,143
<i>Au contraire,</i> Batman.

165
00:20:42,516 --> 00:20:45,076
You of all people should know...

166
00:20:45,252 --> 00:20:48,380
...there's always a way out.

167
00:20:54,294 --> 00:20:56,455
Fugate!

168
00:21:23,824 --> 00:21:26,588
He won't be doing any campaigning
for a few days.

169
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:29,053
But at least the mayor is safe.

170
00:21:29,229 --> 00:21:31,493
No trace of this Clock King, though.

171
00:21:31,665 --> 00:21:34,225
How could anyone survive
a wreck like this?
