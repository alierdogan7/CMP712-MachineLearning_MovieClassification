20
00:02:28,941 --> 00:02:31,652
So he refused?

21
00:02:36,114 --> 00:02:37,824
Count my uncle out.

22
00:02:38,784 --> 00:02:43,330
I gave him our statement requesting a cleanup.

23
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:46,959
He said, ”As Chamberlain, I already know.”

24
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:56,635
-Then why? 
-So I asked: ”Why overlook corruption while the lord is away?”

25
00:02:57,261 --> 00:03:01,765
He smiled and said, ”Perhaps I'm behind it.

26
00:03:03,559 --> 00:03:06,186
”You think I'm good-natured."

27
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:09,773
”People aren't what they seem."

28
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:11,108
”Be careful."

29
00:03:11,775 --> 00:03:15,821
”The worst one is beyond your imagination.”

30
00:03:16,363 --> 00:03:19,157
-And he tore it. 
-Tore it?

31
00:03:20,576 --> 00:03:23,996
-He was unreasonable. 
-Then?

32
00:03:23,996 --> 00:03:29,459
I gave up on him. I met the Superintendent.

33
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:33,380
-What did he say? 
-He was cooperative.

34
00:03:33,714 --> 00:03:36,717
At first he looked embarrassed,

35
00:03:36,717 --> 00:03:40,387
but the story of my uncle shocked him.

36
00:03:40,387 --> 00:03:45,267
-He pondered. 
-”All right,” he said. ”I'll help you.”

37
00:03:46,894 --> 00:03:49,897
”I'll talk with your group.

38
00:03:49,897 --> 00:03:51,857
”Gather them quickly.”

39
00:03:51,857 --> 00:03:56,320
-That's what he said. 
-He's great!

40
00:03:56,320 --> 00:04:02,868
-Right! 
-A powerful support for us. Not a good-natured scarecrow.

41
00:04:11,502 --> 00:04:12,878
Wait.

42
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:35,192
-An interesting story. 
-Don't let him go!

43
00:04:38,445 --> 00:04:42,658
Fool! If I wanted to run, why would I speak?

44
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:50,499
Why are you here?

45
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:53,961
Free room overnight.

46
00:04:55,796 --> 00:05:00,342
By the way, overhearing has a merit.

47
00:05:01,635 --> 00:05:05,722
They say outsiders can be good judges.

48
00:05:06,682 --> 00:05:08,225
Listen.

49
00:05:09,893 --> 00:05:14,231
I say the Chamberlain is all right,

50
00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:17,276
but the Superintendent is no good.

51
00:05:17,651 --> 00:05:21,864
-Don't insult him! 
-Take it easy.

52
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:25,409
I haven't seen them,

53
00:05:26,827 --> 00:05:30,163
so I'm not cheated by their looks.

54
00:05:31,164 --> 00:05:36,920
The Chamberlain is ugly, isn'the? 
Right?

55
00:05:41,175 --> 00:05:48,515
But from your story I judge he's a great man.

56
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:53,520
He doesn't mind being called a fool. 
Great!

57
00:05:56,773 --> 00:05:59,943
But the Superintendent...

58
00:05:59,943 --> 00:06:04,198
You mentioned his name with admiration.

59
00:06:05,908 --> 00:06:09,953
That means he looks attractive. Right?

60
00:06:20,923 --> 00:06:23,800
But people aren't what they seem.

61
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:28,430
-Be careful. 
-Shut up, bum!

62
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:31,391
Wait. 
That's what the Chamberlain said.

63
00:06:32,351 --> 00:06:35,103
He said more exactly.

64
00:06:35,979 --> 00:06:38,440
”The worst one"

65
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:40,526
”is beyond your imagination.”

66
00:06:42,236 --> 00:06:46,698
That is, the Superintendent might be the worst one.

67
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:50,786
Be still and listen.

68
00:06:51,286 --> 00:06:54,206
What's the Superintendent's job?

69
00:06:54,581 --> 00:06:57,459
To keep his clan calm.

70
00:06:57,459 --> 00:07:01,004
But he incited you to riot.

71
00:07:02,214 --> 00:07:04,216
Don't you think it's odd?

72
00:07:11,348 --> 00:07:16,395
And he told you to gather your men.

73
00:07:16,395 --> 00:07:18,856
You're in danger.

74
00:07:18,647 --> 00:07:21,984
If he's the puppeteer, he'll kill you all.

75
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:26,613
Don't do as he says. 
Watch out.

76
00:07:32,494 --> 00:07:37,708
But we're going to see him here tonight.

77
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:40,335
What?

78
00:08:02,941 --> 00:08:05,736
I was right. 
Look!

79
00:08:54,535 --> 00:08:56,537
Surrounded.

80
00:08:57,996 --> 00:09:00,290
Not even a mouse can escape.

81
00:09:17,891 --> 00:09:19,977
Stop being foolish.

82
00:09:20,727 --> 00:09:23,897
Put your swords away. This is no game.

83
00:09:23,897 --> 00:09:27,901
-Don't order us! 
-Suit yourselves.

84
00:09:27,901 --> 00:09:30,779
Die for the Superintendent.

85
00:09:38,412 --> 00:09:41,248
But we're surrounded...

86
00:09:43,333 --> 00:09:46,086
Leave it to me.

87
00:10:02,477 --> 00:10:06,231
Superintendent Kikui sent us. 
Surrender!

88
00:10:10,277 --> 00:10:14,406
You're surrounded! 
No resistance!

89
00:10:24,374 --> 00:10:28,420
Be quiet! 
What do you want?

90
00:10:40,682 --> 00:10:42,351
What are you doing?

91
00:10:48,398 --> 00:10:50,359
Don't intrude into my room!

92
00:11:00,619 --> 00:11:04,540
Looking for trouble?

93
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:07,793
Watch out. You woke me up. I'm cross.

94
00:11:36,113 --> 00:11:38,532
Pull back!

95
00:11:40,242 --> 00:11:42,703
He's not the man we want.

96
00:11:47,332 --> 00:11:51,503
Besides, it'd take a long time to kill him.

97
00:11:55,424 --> 00:11:57,342
You're strong.

98
00:12:00,804 --> 00:12:05,100
If you want a job, visit me at the Superintendent's place.

99
00:12:06,351 --> 00:12:08,353
I'm Hanbei Muroto.

100
00:12:35,255 --> 00:12:37,758
It's safe now. 
Come out.

101
00:12:55,776 --> 00:12:57,903
We don't know how to thank you.

102
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:01,823
Forget it. 
Just give me some money.

103
00:13:02,950 --> 00:13:06,954
I haven't eaten for days. 
I need some sake and food.

104
00:13:27,474 --> 00:13:28,934
I'll take just that.

105
00:13:36,233 --> 00:13:37,609
Goodbye.

106
00:13:50,956 --> 00:13:55,460
But what will you do now?

107
00:13:57,254 --> 00:14:01,633
We've learned a lesson. We'll apologize

108
00:14:01,633 --> 00:14:03,260
and follow my uncle's instructions.

109
00:14:04,344 --> 00:14:07,556
You understand. Good boys.

110
00:14:12,561 --> 00:14:15,314
Wait. It won't do.

111
00:14:16,857 --> 00:14:19,860
The Chamberlain's in danger now.

112
00:14:21,570 --> 00:14:24,448
I'd arrest him, if I were the Superintendent.

113
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:29,328
He sounded as if he knew the worst man.

114
00:14:39,338 --> 00:14:41,089
-Where to? 
-My uncle's.

115
00:14:41,089 --> 00:14:42,591
To get caught?

116
00:14:43,717 --> 00:14:46,345
They know you. You have no chance.

117
00:14:46,345 --> 00:14:50,807
-But it was my fault. 
-Our fault.

118
00:14:50,807 --> 00:14:55,437
-You did just as we planned. 
-But if my uncle...

119
00:14:55,437 --> 00:15:00,776
Stop saying ”my uncle”!
We're all involved in this.

120
00:15:00,776 --> 00:15:05,447
Yes! Live or die, the nine of us...

121
00:15:09,826 --> 00:15:13,747
Ten. You can't take care of yourselves.

122
00:15:39,773 --> 00:15:42,943
It's quiet. Everything seems all right.

123
00:15:42,943 --> 00:15:46,905
No. It's odd. The shutters are still open.

124
00:15:48,866 --> 00:15:50,450
Any fish in the pond?

125
00:15:52,870 --> 00:15:54,538
Many big ones.

126
00:16:17,394 --> 00:16:18,854
Fish.

127
00:16:35,913 --> 00:16:39,750
The Superintendent's men are in my uncle's room.

128
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:43,420
He's in trouble.

129
00:16:43,712 --> 00:16:46,840
Don't be hasty. Let's wait and see.

130
00:16:59,811 --> 00:17:04,816
We can't move like this, like a centipede.

131
00:17:05,859 --> 00:17:10,739
-Any place to hide? 
-There's a barn ahead.

132
00:17:10,739 --> 00:17:12,574
Let's go there.

133
00:17:31,677 --> 00:17:35,389
-Koiso.
 -Izaka.

134
00:17:43,939 --> 00:17:49,903
-Stop crying. 
-The Chamberlain... He's in trouble.

135
00:17:49,903 --> 00:17:51,363
Calm down. Tell me what happened.

136
00:17:52,322 --> 00:17:56,577
The Superintendent brought a troop in the evening.

137
00:17:56,577 --> 00:18:00,247
-We were eating... 
-Myuncle?

138
00:18:00,247 --> 00:18:04,835
-Ten men took him away. 
-Kidnapped? Why?

139
00:18:04,835 --> 00:18:08,547
-He had guards. 
-They had no chance to fight.

140
00:18:08,547 --> 00:18:11,425
-They're locked up. -My aunt?

141
00:18:11,425 --> 00:18:16,180
-I don't know. She's confined,too. 
-Chidori?

142
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:18,932
I think she's with her mother.

143
00:18:20,434 --> 00:18:23,353
-Guards?
 -Fourteen or fifteen.

144
00:18:24,146 --> 00:18:26,773
How could you escape?

145
00:18:26,773 --> 00:18:31,111
The sentries wanted me to bring sake for them.

146
00:18:31,111 --> 00:18:34,531
-Alone? 
-A man followed me the first time.

147
00:18:34,531 --> 00:18:39,411
-But not now. 
-Send her back.

148
00:18:40,871 --> 00:18:42,581
Back to the guards.

149
00:18:44,291 --> 00:18:47,169
They'd be more cautious

150
00:18:47,169 --> 00:18:49,254
if they found she got away.

151
00:18:50,130 --> 00:18:53,800
Better still, drown them with sake. 
Get them drunk.

152
00:18:55,135 --> 00:18:58,847
We can easily rescue the old woman and the girl.

153
00:19:00,265 --> 00:19:01,600
I see.

154
00:19:02,392 --> 00:19:04,895
Koiso,will you go back?

155
00:19:09,316 --> 00:19:11,568
Yes, I will.

156
00:19:18,867 --> 00:19:20,410
She's a samurai.

157
00:19:23,497 --> 00:19:25,541
She's more reliable than you, kids.

158
00:19:40,264 --> 00:19:44,601
I appreciate your help, but watch your tongue.

159
00:19:44,601 --> 00:19:47,729
”The old woman and the girl!”

160
00:19:48,856 --> 00:19:51,650
Don't give us orders for everything we do.

161
00:19:52,109 --> 00:19:56,947
You plan to save the lady, but first the Chamberlain.

162
00:19:57,739 --> 00:20:01,410
Do you know where he is?

163
00:20:02,536 --> 00:20:07,207
No? Then we can't save him now.

164
00:20:07,207 --> 00:20:12,504
What's the Superintendent going to do with him?

165
00:20:13,255 --> 00:20:17,843
We must find that first.

166
00:20:17,843 --> 00:20:21,138
The Superintendent must've told her why he arrested him.

167
00:20:21,138 --> 00:20:23,765
Don't you want to know?

168
00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:33,609
Understand? Then split up.

169
00:20:34,318 --> 00:20:37,905
Four of us, including me, will save the old woman.

170
00:20:37,905 --> 00:20:41,783
The others, find the Chamberlain.

171
00:20:43,410 --> 00:20:48,373
We'll meet at a safe place. Is there any?

172
00:20:49,458 --> 00:20:52,920
We can't go far with the ladies.

173
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:58,800
-My house is near. 
-No! It's next door to Kurofuji.

174
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:03,931
-Kurofuji? 
-One of the traitors.

175
00:21:03,931 --> 00:21:08,310
-Interesting! Good. Let's go there. 
-No! You fool!

176
00:21:08,310 --> 00:21:11,730
Can't you say”yes” once in a while?

177
00:21:13,899 --> 00:21:18,612
They'll never think of searching their neighbors.

178
00:22:01,822 --> 00:22:03,407
Three guards.

179
00:22:05,534 --> 00:22:09,830
I'll knock one down, so you two will get him.

180
00:22:10,747 --> 00:22:12,165
Don't kill him.

181
00:22:12,666 --> 00:22:15,460
He may tell us where the Chamberlain is.

182
00:22:18,422 --> 00:22:23,969
While I take care ofthe rest,

183
00:22:23,969 --> 00:22:25,637
go in and rescue the women.

184
00:22:27,097 --> 00:22:30,726
Then run to the barn. 
Got it?

185
00:22:41,361 --> 00:22:43,197
Why the look?

186
00:22:44,239 --> 00:22:46,575
You want to use your swords? Forget it.

187
00:22:47,409 --> 00:22:49,411
Stupid friends are dangerous.

188
00:22:49,411 --> 00:22:52,372
You might cut me in the back.

189
00:23:00,464 --> 00:23:05,969
The guardhouse. Your plan seems to have worked.

190
00:23:08,430 --> 00:23:10,807
Now!

191
00:23:41,755 --> 00:23:46,468
Too bad. Change of guards.

192
00:23:46,468 --> 00:23:48,595
Muroto... I met him at the shrine.

193
00:23:50,764 --> 00:23:53,600
He offered me ajob.

194
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:57,729
-What's he to the Superintendent?
-A brain.

195
00:23:57,729 --> 00:24:01,567
-Let's go now. He's alone. 
-You blind?

196
00:24:02,568 --> 00:24:04,736
Those three guards were cats.

197
00:24:05,904 --> 00:24:08,740
He's a tiger, but he's alone.

198
00:24:29,178 --> 00:24:34,349
-Why the racket? 
-The guards are drunk.

199
00:24:41,231 --> 00:24:43,150
So are you.

200
00:24:46,153 --> 00:24:48,197
Wash your faces in the pond.

201
00:25:02,586 --> 00:25:03,712
Do it!

202
00:25:09,593 --> 00:25:12,137
I'll take a look. Stand watch.

203
00:25:41,333 --> 00:25:47,214
They arrested my uncle to save evidence of his graft?

204
00:25:47,214 --> 00:25:48,006
They said so?

205
00:25:50,384 --> 00:25:53,387
I see. Good excuse.

206
00:25:59,518 --> 00:26:01,895
Who's that person?

207
00:26:01,895 --> 00:26:07,901
It's hard to explain, but he's our friend.

208
00:26:07,901 --> 00:26:12,906
-He saved our lives. 
-Is that so? Thank you.

209
00:26:31,592 --> 00:26:34,845
What's keeping those two? 
It's dangerous here.

210
00:26:34,845 --> 00:26:40,434
But I never ran so fast in my life.

211
00:26:40,434 --> 00:26:43,854
Let me rest here, or I can't walk.

212
00:26:49,359 --> 00:26:52,279
I've never been here.

213
00:26:53,155 --> 00:27:00,120
-The hay smells nice.
 -I love this smell.

214
00:27:00,621 --> 00:27:05,542
We came here often. 
Didn't we?

215
00:27:10,672 --> 00:27:12,841
I'll get the two.

216
00:27:15,802 --> 00:27:21,141
-Why did you come here? 
-It's so quie there...

217
00:27:21,683 --> 00:27:26,605
Lying on the hay like this...

218
00:27:27,147 --> 00:27:30,484
with the scent around me...

219
00:27:30,484 --> 00:27:34,905
I become drowsy. Mother...

220
00:27:35,822 --> 00:27:41,828
once I really fell asleep on his arm.

221
00:27:44,915 --> 00:27:47,167
Bad manners.

222
00:27:48,919 --> 00:27:50,546
But...

223
00:27:51,630 --> 00:27:54,800
Really...

224
00:27:57,886 --> 00:28:00,347
It smells nice.

225
00:28:10,858 --> 00:28:15,195
They were shoving his head in the pond to make him talk.

226
00:28:17,197 --> 00:28:19,157
But he wouldn't.

227
00:28:20,117 --> 00:28:23,453
-He only spat water?
 -He doesn't know.

228
00:28:23,453 --> 00:28:24,872
Who'd talk?

229
00:28:26,373 --> 00:28:32,212
-Ass! What'll we do?
-He saw us. Kill him.

230
00:28:32,212 --> 00:28:35,257
No. You mustn't.

231
00:28:35,591 --> 00:28:39,386
Was it you who killed the others guards?

232
00:28:42,097 --> 00:28:45,517
I had to. To save you.

233
00:28:45,517 --> 00:28:50,939
I shouldn't say this after you saved us, but

234
00:28:50,939 --> 00:28:54,568
killing people is a bad habit.

235
00:29:01,950 --> 00:29:06,496
You're too sharp. That's your trouble.

236
00:29:09,583 --> 00:29:12,669
You're like a drawn sword.

237
00:29:14,338 --> 00:29:19,801
Sharp, naked without a sheath.

238
00:29:19,801 --> 00:29:21,470
You cut well.

239
00:29:21,845 --> 00:29:27,809
But good swords are kept in their sheathes.

240
00:29:31,897 --> 00:29:34,566
What'll you dowith him?

241
00:29:36,735 --> 00:29:40,447
Come with us, will you?

242
00:29:41,281 --> 00:29:43,659
You'll be safe.

243
00:29:50,624 --> 00:29:52,709
Run! Over the rear wall!

244
00:30:10,310 --> 00:30:11,937
No,that way!

245
00:30:12,771 --> 00:30:14,606
Guard the front!

246
00:30:18,318 --> 00:30:24,741
-Hurry! 
-It may be easy for you, but not for us.

247
00:30:25,367 --> 00:30:31,331
-We can't. Can we, Mother? 
-Hurry !

248
00:30:33,375 --> 00:30:36,128
Use me as a footstool...

249
00:30:37,337 --> 00:30:40,549
-No, it's rude. 
-Go ahead!

250
00:30:40,549 --> 00:30:45,637
-But... 
-No buts. Hurry, before I'm forced to kill again!

251
00:30:46,096 --> 00:30:50,809
-Hurry! 
-Well then, excuse me.

252
00:31:04,531 --> 00:31:08,869
Hurry! Don't let Kurofuji's men see us.

253
00:31:30,849 --> 00:31:35,437
-I'm hungry. Feed me. 
-We're preparing.

254
00:31:35,437 --> 00:31:41,818
-Sake? 
-No time for that. Let's discuss what to do.

255
00:31:42,236 --> 00:31:44,446
Sake makes me bright.

256
00:31:48,283 --> 00:31:52,246
They're going to pin their crime on the Chamberlain.

257
00:31:52,246 --> 00:31:56,333
They'll make him write a false confession, then...

258
00:31:56,708 --> 00:31:59,294
Then what?

259
00:32:05,801 --> 00:32:09,555
You can be frank with us.

260
00:32:15,227 --> 00:32:19,398
They'll make him kill himself.

261
00:32:19,898 --> 00:32:23,819
-What shall we do, mother?  That's terrible. 
-Don't worry .

262
00:32:23,819 --> 00:32:27,865
Your father is a shrewd old fox.

263
00:32:27,865 --> 00:32:32,369
It won't be easy to make him commit harakiri.

264
00:32:36,123 --> 00:32:42,421
And what are you going to do?

265
00:32:42,421 --> 00:32:47,885
We'll find him and get him back. Then...

266
00:32:47,885 --> 00:32:51,597
That's enough. By shifting the blame,

267
00:32:51,597 --> 00:32:53,849
they've shown their guilt.

268
00:32:54,808 --> 00:32:57,269
If we rescue him, they'll be finished.

269
00:33:00,564 --> 00:33:05,694
-That may be so. 
-Can we get him back?

270
00:33:05,694 --> 00:33:07,779
If not,we'll be finished.

271
00:33:09,448 --> 00:33:12,201
Please do your best.

272
00:33:20,918 --> 00:33:25,172
But please, don't use too much violence.

273
00:33:29,009 --> 00:33:33,388
-By the way, may I have your name? 
-Myname?

274
00:33:46,985 --> 00:33:48,612
It's...

275
00:33:57,871 --> 00:34:01,333
Tsubaki (Camellia) Sanjuro (30-year-old).

276
00:34:01,333 --> 00:34:03,418
Going on 40.

277
00:34:05,838 --> 00:34:08,507
You're interesting.

278
00:34:11,885 --> 00:34:16,473
Speaking ofcamellias, they're really beautiful.

279
00:34:16,473 --> 00:34:20,102
Kurofuji's place is called Camellia Mansion.

280
00:34:20,853 --> 00:34:22,813
Let's peek.

281
00:34:36,660 --> 00:34:37,786
How is it?

282
00:34:42,666 --> 00:34:44,334
Very quiet.

283
00:35:09,151 --> 00:35:10,235
Who is it?

284
00:35:12,196 --> 00:35:13,697
A camellia fell.

285
00:35:16,617 --> 00:35:21,455
Why don't you relax and have another drink?

286
00:35:26,460 --> 00:35:29,421
But, Kurofuji...

287
00:35:30,839 --> 00:35:34,551
Will the Chamberlain write a confession so easily?

288
00:35:34,551 --> 00:35:37,721
Leave it to the Superintendent.

289
00:35:38,972 --> 00:35:42,559
Can you trust him? He failed this time.

290
00:36:05,332 --> 00:36:09,878
The Chamberlain is no fool.

291
00:36:10,420 --> 00:36:14,758
We underestimated him. There's a way.

292
00:36:15,717 --> 00:36:18,303
His wife and daughter...

293
00:36:19,471 --> 00:36:22,266
-Who is it? 
-Muroto.

294
00:36:34,862 --> 00:36:37,698
Muroto is reportingto Kurofuji.

295
00:36:38,699 --> 00:36:40,826
About Aunt and Chidori?

296
00:36:41,201 --> 00:36:46,957
That means the traitors are with Kurofuji.

297
00:36:46,957 --> 00:36:48,917
The three of them together.

298
00:36:48,917 --> 00:36:53,172
If they're in his house, my uncle is there,too.

299
00:36:54,631 --> 00:36:56,884
Fool! What were the guards doing?

300
00:36:58,510 --> 00:37:04,725
-We can't use the women anymore. 
-We can.

301
00:37:04,725 --> 00:37:08,729
The Chamberlain doesn't know we lost them.

302
00:37:08,729 --> 00:37:13,150
The problem is, they must be watching our houses.

303
00:37:13,567 --> 00:37:18,113
They saw you come in. They know we're here.

304
00:37:18,113 --> 00:37:21,200
-That's right. We're in danger.
-Don't worry .

305
00:37:21,575 --> 00:37:26,205
I sent my men to your houses, too.

306
00:37:28,790 --> 00:37:31,877
A man rushed in the Superintendent's.

307
00:37:34,755 --> 00:37:37,090
A man reported to Takebayashi.

308
00:37:39,676 --> 00:37:44,765
-Aren't they together? 
-Where's my uncle?

309
00:37:44,765 --> 00:37:47,643
But to carry out their plan,

310
00:37:47,643 --> 00:37:51,188
they'll see the Chamberlain soon. Let's wait.

311
00:37:51,813 --> 00:37:56,401
Don't just sit and wait. The Chamberlain's gone.

312
00:37:56,401 --> 00:37:59,446
Stir up the people, run around shouting ”why?”

313
00:37:59,446 --> 00:38:02,449
They'll want to kill him before that.

314
00:38:02,449 --> 00:38:06,620
Give them no chance.

315
00:38:07,371 --> 00:38:10,374
They'll be shocked and meet.

316
00:38:20,467 --> 00:38:24,555
-What's the drum for? 
-As planned.

317
00:38:39,945 --> 00:38:46,702
”We have found that the Chamberlain abused his authority."

318
00:38:46,702 --> 00:38:52,499
”Accused of malfeasance, he tried to destroy evidence."

319
00:38:52,499 --> 00:38:56,837
”Therefore, the elders sent a messenger to our lord in Edo,

320
00:38:56,837 --> 00:39:02,593
and confined him as a precaution."

321
00:39:03,719 --> 00:39:09,141
”He seems to have many followers. Remain calm,

322
00:39:09,141 --> 00:39:13,187
and do not let them incite you.  /Superintendent Kikui.”

323
00:39:16,815 --> 00:39:19,318
They moved quickly.

324
00:39:20,194 --> 00:39:21,987
They're smart enough.

325
00:39:23,488 --> 00:39:28,118
Too bad. If the clan is quiet,

326
00:39:28,118 --> 00:39:32,581
-we can't make a move. 
-If we do, we'll fall in their trap.

327
00:39:34,374 --> 00:39:38,837
They'll have enough time to play their game.

328
00:39:38,837 --> 00:39:40,672
No. They'll act.

329
00:39:41,798 --> 00:39:44,218
They don't know we're only ten.

330
00:39:44,718 --> 00:39:46,929
They said ”many followers.”

331
00:39:48,096 --> 00:39:50,182
They must act.

332
00:39:55,687 --> 00:39:58,649
We've done everything.

333
00:40:00,359 --> 00:40:05,572
Relax, Takebayashi. 
Pressure the Chamberlain.

334
00:40:05,572 --> 00:40:10,661
-His men? 
-They can't make a move.

335
00:40:10,661 --> 00:40:16,291
That worries me. 
Desperate men will try anything.

336
00:40:16,291 --> 00:40:18,544
They're dangerous.

337
00:40:21,588 --> 00:40:24,967
All right.

338
00:40:24,967 --> 00:40:30,138
-We'll lure them out once again. And... -We can't.

339
00:40:30,138 --> 00:40:35,185
We can. Let them know where the Chamberlain is.

340
00:40:37,729 --> 00:40:41,567
As you said ,they'll try anythingto get him back.

341
00:40:41,567 --> 00:40:45,612
When they show up,

342
00:40:47,114 --> 00:40:50,450
arrest them. 
-Nonsense!

343
00:40:50,450 --> 00:40:53,287
Are you mad? 
That's what worries me.

344
00:40:53,287 --> 00:40:57,249
Listen. It won't be here.

345
00:40:57,249 --> 00:41:01,587
We'll lure them out somewhere else.

346
00:41:02,379 --> 00:41:06,341
Show them we're meeting there.

347
00:41:06,341 --> 00:41:10,220
Don't worry. There'll be no danger.

348
00:41:11,430 --> 00:41:15,642
Only our palanquins will meet.

349
00:41:15,642 --> 00:41:18,896
We don't have to be in them.

350
00:41:38,415 --> 00:41:42,461
-They're moving! 
-I'll follow them. Tell our men.

351
00:42:05,692 --> 00:42:08,529
Kurofuji left in a palanquin!

352
00:42:14,117 --> 00:42:16,537
Kurofuji entered Kikui's house.

353
00:42:22,543 --> 00:42:25,254
Two palanquins left Kikui's.

354
00:42:31,969 --> 00:42:36,181
-Kurofuji and Kikui. 
-Where to?

355
00:42:40,477 --> 00:42:43,188
They entered Takebayashi's place.

356
00:42:43,522 --> 00:42:47,234
Three palanquins left Takebayashi's. They went west.

357
00:42:47,234 --> 00:42:50,487
-Kurofuji's villa is there. 
-That's the place. Let's go!

358
00:42:50,487 --> 00:42:55,409
Wait. It will be bad  if they see you.

359
00:42:55,409 --> 00:42:59,580
But there's only one guard for each palanquin.

360
00:42:59,580 --> 00:43:04,918
It looks like atrick. We could capture them easily.

361
00:43:04,918 --> 00:43:08,463
-Good idea! 
-Then make them confess.

362
00:43:08,463 --> 00:43:12,384
Fool! Don't you think it sounds too easy?

363
00:43:12,926 --> 00:43:16,138
-Bait looks easy to get.
 -But,

364
00:43:16,555 --> 00:43:19,141
if it's really a chance, don't miss it.

365
00:43:19,766 --> 00:43:24,897
We'll follow them, and attack them, if possible.

366
00:43:25,522 --> 00:43:29,985
-Do you agree? 
-Not a good idea,

367
00:43:30,944 --> 00:43:33,363
but it may keep me awake.

368
00:44:22,454 --> 00:44:27,584
-Are they all there? -Nothing suspicious about the palanquins?

369
00:44:27,584 --> 00:44:32,673
-You can't tell. 
-No guards concealed? -None atall.

370
00:44:32,673 --> 00:44:37,386
-Let's attack. 
-Before they enter the villa!

371
00:44:37,386 --> 00:44:41,390
Wait. 
I think you'd better stop.

372
00:45:10,586 --> 00:45:15,465
-Wait! There's something wrong. 
-Be quiet!

373
00:45:16,717 --> 00:45:18,635
Go ahead, then. Who cares?

374
00:45:20,387 --> 00:45:21,471
Let's go!

375
00:45:49,541 --> 00:45:51,835
Pardon me.

376
00:45:51,835 --> 00:45:55,923
Aren't these the palanquins of our senior clansmen?

377
00:45:55,923 --> 00:45:59,176
We learned today

378
00:45:59,176 --> 00:46:01,845
of the Chamberlain's misbehavior.

379
00:46:01,845 --> 00:46:05,599
With so few guards,

380
00:46:05,599 --> 00:46:08,393
you seem to need help.

381
00:46:08,393 --> 00:46:11,438
We're ready to help you.

382
00:46:14,858 --> 00:46:17,861
Drop your weapons!

383
00:46:18,695 --> 00:46:20,405
You're under arrest!

384
00:46:22,199 --> 00:46:27,454
Don't pretend you're not the Chamberlain's men!

385
00:46:27,454 --> 00:46:31,124
The Chamberlain's men? Ridiculous!

386
00:46:31,124 --> 00:46:34,837
No excuses! It was the Superintendent's trick.

387
00:46:34,837 --> 00:46:39,424
-You followed the palanquins! 
-Wait.

388
00:46:52,312 --> 00:46:55,482
You disgust me. Stupidity is dangerous.

389
00:47:11,498 --> 00:47:12,165
But how?

390
00:47:14,334 --> 00:47:19,214
I happened to sneeze, and the lady heard me.

391
00:47:19,214 --> 00:47:21,550
She released me.

392
00:47:23,886 --> 00:47:29,099
-Wearing my best kimono! -She let me wear it.

393
00:47:29,099 --> 00:47:31,143
Why didn't you escape?

394
00:47:33,437 --> 00:47:38,275
I couldn't, since the lady trusted me completely.

395
00:47:39,818 --> 00:47:46,283
And your story is contrary to what I wastold.

396
00:47:47,534 --> 00:47:48,368
Good lesson.

397
00:47:55,125 --> 00:47:56,376
Excuse me.

398
00:48:06,345 --> 00:48:08,972
The lady is naive in every sense of the word.

399
00:48:10,557 --> 00:48:13,435
She's stupid, that's all.

400
00:48:15,395 --> 00:48:19,358
You mean the horsemen weren't the conspirators?

401
00:48:23,237 --> 00:48:24,530
That's right.

402
00:48:26,198 --> 00:48:28,825
We released them, but they refused to go.

403
00:48:30,869 --> 00:48:36,124
They even suspect us and want our explanation.

404
00:48:41,505 --> 00:48:45,551
Trapped by your own little tricks!

405
00:48:45,551 --> 00:48:50,514
-You made more enemies instead. 
-No.

406
00:48:51,306 --> 00:48:55,853
They came to guard us in the first place.

407
00:48:55,853 --> 00:49:00,774
If we explain about the decoy palanquins...

408
00:49:02,985 --> 00:49:06,947
They're all very strong.

409
00:49:07,698 --> 00:49:10,450
-They'll gladly help us. 
-Good.

410
00:49:11,577 --> 00:49:15,122
Rope them in and send them here.

411
00:49:15,122 --> 00:49:18,125
That's not like you.

412
00:49:18,125 --> 00:49:20,586
It'll show we're here.

413
00:49:21,753 --> 00:49:23,839
Why not?

414
00:49:25,757 --> 00:49:28,844
It's about time for a showdown.

415
00:49:40,230 --> 00:49:42,149
The finale is close.

416
00:49:44,359 --> 00:49:47,279
Judging from what the horsemen said,

417
00:49:47,279 --> 00:49:49,656
the clansmen are on their side.

418
00:49:52,367 --> 00:49:54,411
We're mice in a trap.

419
00:49:55,162 --> 00:49:57,664
We have no chance.

420
00:49:58,332 --> 00:50:03,670
Live or die,the nine of us are together.

421
00:50:03,670 --> 00:50:05,464
Ten.

422
00:50:11,428 --> 00:50:12,930
I'll go to Kikui.

423
00:50:14,640 --> 00:50:18,310
-What for? 
-A job.

424
00:50:19,436 --> 00:50:21,855
Muroto kindly offered me one.

425
00:50:37,913 --> 00:50:40,582
-Where to? 
-We'll follow him.

426
00:50:40,582 --> 00:50:42,167
He might betray us.

427
00:50:43,293 --> 00:50:47,589
If so, why did he say he'd go to Kikui?

428
00:50:48,131 --> 00:50:52,636
-He went to check his house. 
-I think so, too.

429
00:50:53,470 --> 00:50:56,723
Quiet! 
-He'll never betray us.

430
00:50:56,723 --> 00:50:59,685
But what he said worries me.

431
00:50:59,685 --> 00:51:02,396
No. That's the way he talks.

432
00:51:03,814 --> 00:51:08,735
-It's true. 
-You can't tell what he'll do.

433
00:51:10,320 --> 00:51:11,738
A monster!

434
00:51:34,928 --> 00:51:39,224
-Who are you? 
-I want Muroto.

435
00:51:39,224 --> 00:51:40,684
He's busy!

436
00:52:18,180 --> 00:52:22,434
Welcome! I've been waiting for you.

437
00:52:24,978 --> 00:52:29,316
But I hear you're busy. I'll come again.

438
00:52:29,316 --> 00:52:31,985
Never mind. Come in.

439
00:52:40,244 --> 00:52:42,621
I trust him!

440
00:52:42,621 --> 00:52:45,624
How many times did he save us?

441
00:52:45,624 --> 00:52:48,168
People change!

442
00:52:48,168 --> 00:52:50,546
He thinks it's time to leave us.

443
00:52:50,546 --> 00:52:53,715
He has to worry about himself.

444
00:52:53,715 --> 00:52:56,718
If he turns us in, he'll be employed.

445
00:52:56,718 --> 00:53:00,764
No! He's poor, but a respectable samurai!

446
00:53:00,764 --> 00:53:04,935
-He beat Kikui's men easily. 
-Quiet!

447
00:53:04,935 --> 00:53:10,190
He begged for money. A samurai starves before he begs.

448
00:53:10,190 --> 00:53:14,152
-He's just open and a little eccentric. 
-I trust him!

449
00:53:14,152 --> 00:53:17,990
-He's a good man, I'm sure! -
You're the lady's kin.

450
00:53:17,990 --> 00:53:22,536
You trust everyone!

451
00:53:30,210 --> 00:53:35,924
Mother sent me to ask you 
why you were shouting.

452
00:53:35,924 --> 00:53:37,301
Nothing.

453
00:53:39,386 --> 00:53:41,847
-But... 
-Nothing!

454
00:53:51,857 --> 00:53:53,483
Excuse me.

455
00:53:59,531 --> 00:54:02,868
I was listening in the closet.

456
00:54:02,868 --> 00:54:04,912
-Get back! 
-In a moment.

457
00:54:05,787 --> 00:54:10,626
I trust that samurai, too. Listen.

458
00:54:11,543 --> 00:54:16,632
I may sound strange, but... When the lady climbed the wall,

459
00:54:16,632 --> 00:54:19,927
he offered to be her footstool.

460
00:54:19,927 --> 00:54:25,974
Her character impressed him. It shows he's a good man.

461
00:54:25,974 --> 00:54:30,312
Nonsense! He said she's stupid.

462
00:54:30,938 --> 00:54:35,275
As someone said, that's the way he talks.

463
00:54:35,275 --> 00:54:37,903
He means praise by abuse.

464
00:54:43,450 --> 00:54:46,411
-Understand? 
-No! I don't!

465
00:54:47,204 --> 00:54:51,792
No more talk.We'll follow him. He's dangerous.

466
00:54:51,792 --> 00:54:58,215
Wait. Don't split up. One-sided judgment isn't fair.

467
00:54:58,215 --> 00:55:02,636
If you go, we'll go two from each side...

468
00:55:02,636 --> 00:55:05,389
Yasukawa and Kawahara, Izaka and Hirose.
