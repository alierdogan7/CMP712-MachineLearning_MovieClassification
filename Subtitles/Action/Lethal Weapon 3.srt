COP: Nobody's dead.
RIGGS: The night's young.

6
00:01:42,332 --> 00:01:44,084
This is Sergeant Murtaugh.

7
00:01:44,172 --> 00:01:45,571
RIGGS: Threat or scare?
COP: Real thing.

8
00:01:45,652 --> 00:01:47,210
COP: He saw the device.

9
00:01:47,292 --> 00:01:50,364
MAN: It's on Level 1, by the gas pumps.
I wrote the license plate number.

10

That's okay, sir. Thanks a lot.

11
00:01:52,212 --> 00:01:54,328
RIGGS: You evacuated the building?
COP: It's clean.

12
00:01:54,412 --> 00:01:55,845
ROGER: Where's the bomb squad?
COP: Coming.

13
00:01:55,932 --> 00:01:58,082
ROGER: Good. It's under control. Let's go.

14
00:01:58,172 --> 00:02:00,367
I think we ought to check this out.

15
00:02:01,412 --> 00:02:02,811
ROGER: Riggs?
RIGGS: What?

16
00:02:02,892 --> 00:02:04,962
- Bomb squad's coming.
- There's no bomb!

17
00:02:05,052 --> 00:02:07,486
- How do you know?
- Because it's a full moon.

18
00:02:07,572 --> 00:02:09,767
Moon, lunar, lunatics. They're everywhere.

19
00:02:09,852 --> 00:02:11,808
RIGGS: Is that Greek?
ROGER: No, Latin.

20
00:02:11,892 --> 00:02:13,723
You surprise the shit out of me.

21
00:02:13,812 --> 00:02:16,087
There's no bomb.
It's probably a false alarm.

22
00:02:16,172 --> 00:02:18,686
It happens. He probably saw a radio
on the back seat.

23
00:02:18,772 --> 00:02:21,206
Let's not mess with it.
Wait for the bomb squad.

24
00:02:21,292 --> 00:02:24,045
You're right. You sit tight,
I'll be right back.

25
00:02:24,572 --> 00:02:26,130
What's the matter with you?

26
00:02:26,212 --> 00:02:28,442
- There's a bomb in there!
- No, there's not.

27
00:02:28,532 --> 00:02:30,170
- There's a bomb in there!
- There is not!

There's a bomb in there!

29

- How?

30
00:02:33,172 --> 00:02:36,289
I've got eight days till retirement
and I won't make a stupid mistake.

There is no bomb!
I'll bet vital parts of my anatomy!

33
00:02:41,732 --> 00:02:43,006
Trust me. Okay?

34
00:02:47,372 --> 00:02:49,522
That's usually my first mistake.

35
00:02:50,212 --> 00:02:51,361
Hey, Riggs!

36
00:02:51,452 --> 00:02:53,363
ROGER: Hey, wait. I'm coming.

37
00:02:53,532 --> 00:02:54,647
RIGGS: Rog?

38
00:02:54,812 --> 00:02:57,610
RIGGS: Is your insurance paid up?
ROGER: Of course. Why?

39
00:02:57,692 --> 00:03:00,650
RIGGS: There could be a bomb in here.
ROGER: Oh, God!

40
00:03:02,972 --> 00:03:06,442
ROGER: I hate it when I'm right.
RIGGS: Learn to trust your instincts more.

41

ROGER: Oh, God.

42
00:03:08,412 --> 00:03:11,131
The first impression
can often be the right one.

43

RIGGS: Drive shaft...
I wonder if there's a bomb.

44
00:03:15,852 --> 00:03:17,604
Just don't touch it.

45
00:03:18,892 --> 00:03:20,245

Son of a bitch, just look at it.

50

That's all I'll do, just look.

There's more plastic than Cher.

52
00:03:42,412 --> 00:03:44,448
RIGGS: I love this job.
This is amateur night.

53
00:03:44,532 --> 00:03:46,011
Open the door. I can't hear you.

54
00:03:46,092 --> 00:03:47,605
RIGGS: Open the door.

55
00:03:47,932 --> 00:03:49,285
Don't do nothing.

56
00:03:50,492 --> 00:03:51,925
Not that one!

ROGER: You son of a bitch.

58
00:03:53,612 --> 00:03:56,524
RIGGS: This is a pretty shonky job.
I can dismantle it.

59
00:03:56,612 --> 00:03:59,001

Everybody's outside. Just me, you
and the cat are dumb enough to be here.

00:04:06,012 --> 00:04:08,162
Nearly a cat-tastrophe, huh?

64
00:04:09,292 --> 00:04:11,123
- Relax, Rog. Relax.
- Right.

65
00:04:11,212 --> 00:04:12,008
Don't do nothing.

66
00:04:12,092 --> 00:04:15,562
We've got 9 minutes and 7 seconds left.
You know what we can do?

67
00:04:15,852 --> 00:04:17,046
We could drive it out.

68
00:04:17,132 --> 00:04:18,645
Fine, it's your turn to drive.

69
00:04:18,732 --> 00:04:20,609
No keys. I could hot-wire it.

70
00:04:21,452 --> 00:04:23,761
Don't even say "hot-wire"
around this stuff!

71
00:04:23,852 --> 00:04:24,807
You're right.

72
00:04:24,892 --> 00:04:26,723
Why am I doing this? Why?

73
00:04:27,012 --> 00:04:29,731
I'm going to have to do it
the old-fashioned way.

74
00:04:29,892 --> 00:04:31,450
What are you thinking?

75
00:04:31,692 --> 00:04:33,569
ROGER: What are you thinking?

76
00:04:34,492 --> 00:04:36,687
- I'm thinking we should cut the blue wire.
- Wait!

77
00:04:36,772 --> 00:04:38,649
- That's not what I think.
- You think maybe the red?

78
00:04:38,732 --> 00:04:39,960
No! No!

79
00:04:40,132 --> 00:04:42,726
I'm thinking it's 8 minutes and 42 seconds.

80
00:04:42,852 --> 00:04:46,128
We can go upstairs, wait for
the bomb squad, and have a cappuccino.

81
00:04:46,212 --> 00:04:49,807
The bomb squad never gets here on time.
And it's 8 minutes, 31 seconds.

82
00:04:49,892 --> 00:04:51,086
Rog, please.

83
00:04:51,292 --> 00:04:52,202
Forget the cappuccino.

84
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:55,489
- You know what they'll say?
- "Get the fuck out of here!"

85
00:04:55,732 --> 00:04:59,725
But then they'll say: "Let's cut
the blue wire," which I'll do right now.

86
00:05:00,012 --> 00:05:01,684
- Wait, wait!
- What?

87
00:05:02,052 --> 00:05:03,201
How can you be so sure?

88
00:05:03,292 --> 00:05:04,327
It's just a hunch.

89
00:05:04,412 --> 00:05:05,447
A hunch?

90
00:05:05,532 --> 00:05:06,931
Remember the bomb under your toilet?

91
00:05:07,012 --> 00:05:09,810
- How could I forget?
- Red wire, blue wire, same thing.

92
00:05:09,892 --> 00:05:12,884
This is more simplified,
but a bit more powerful.

93
00:05:13,052 --> 00:05:14,883
From where I sat, I couldn't see.

94
00:05:14,972 --> 00:05:16,371
Forget it. Come on, trust me.

95
00:05:16,452 --> 00:05:17,680
Trust you?

96
00:05:17,852 --> 00:05:20,366
Guess not. I'm cutting the red wire, okay?

97
00:05:20,452 --> 00:05:21,805
Ho... ho...

98
00:05:22,972 --> 00:05:24,087
What? What?

99
00:05:24,172 --> 00:05:26,208
A minute ago you said blue!

100
00:05:27,132 --> 00:05:28,008
I did?

101
00:05:28,092 --> 00:05:29,241
You said blue!

102
00:05:29,812 --> 00:05:31,291
- I meant red.
- Sure?

103
00:05:31,612 --> 00:05:33,125
We can do it your way.

104

RIGGS: [Whispers] Quiet!

105

I'm sure, okay?

109
00:05:43,332 --> 00:05:44,242
What?

00:05:44,732 --> 00:05:47,610
Won't you miss all this good stuff
when you retire?

111

ROGER: Seven days till retirement,
I'm busted down to patrolman.

133
00:07:33,212 --> 00:07:35,089
I should've cut the red wire.

134
00:07:35,572 --> 00:07:37,802
- You did.
- No, I cut the blue wire.

135
00:07:37,892 --> 00:07:39,484
That's what I meant.

136
00:07:39,652 --> 00:07:42,689
- We should've waited for the bomb squad.
- Must I hear this every day?

137

- Every day until I retire!
- That'll be a week too long.

- My feet are killing me.
- They're killing me, too.

- How?
- I have to listen to you bitch about them!

- Because you should've cut the red wire!
- I did cut the red wire!

It won't keep anything out.

You may have nothing to do, but I do.

Hold it! Leo's here. I'll take care of it.

346
00:17:54,372 --> 00:17:57,364
I'll make some calls.
We'll get some back-dated permits.

LEO: Which phone can I use?
ROGER: Sunroom.

348
00:18:02,412 --> 00:18:05,051
ROGER: It must be easier than this.
LEO: Count on Leo Getz.

349
00:18:05,132 --> 00:18:08,249
You need less aggravation.
Come to work with me.

350
00:18:08,572 --> 00:18:10,688
Thank you, Leo! Son of a bitch!

Hey, Nick.

- Wasn't that Darryl?
- Yeah.

360
00:18:42,812 --> 00:18:45,042
I haven't seen him around in a while.

361
00:18:45,572 --> 00:18:46,721
He dropped out of high school.

362
00:18:46,812 --> 00:18:49,042
Those are pretty gang colors he's wearing.

363
00:18:49,132 --> 00:18:50,406
Yeah, I know.

364
00:18:51,772 --> 00:18:52,921
Hey, Nick?

RIGGS: "Word."

and it's all coming true.

379
00:19:39,092 --> 00:19:43,165
TYRONE: You sank your money into this,
out here in the middle of the desert?

380
00:19:43,292 --> 00:19:45,681
JACK: Know why it'll be a gold mine?
TYRONE: Do tell.

381
00:19:45,772 --> 00:19:49,401
Because no one wants to live
next door to a menace like you.

382
00:19:49,492 --> 00:19:52,564
I came to do business,
not to be insulted by you.

Don't I pay you good and take care of you?

00:20:05,172 --> 00:20:08,323
- Sure you do.
- What about the stunt you and Billy pulled?

388
00:20:08,852 --> 00:20:09,921
It was a good plan. It worked.

It worked? It didn't work.

390
00:20:12,212 --> 00:20:13,884
You got nailed, first time out.

391
00:20:13,972 --> 00:20:16,281
Nobody who works for me
goes into business for themselves.

Do you understand me?

393

Right, Tyrone?

There's nothing I can do about that now.

You invest time and energy
into training somebody.

408

Then, they get greedy and do something
stupid that jeopardizes everything.

00:26:17,852 --> 00:26:19,922
- Can I borrow your glasses?
- Yeah.

515
00:26:20,132 --> 00:26:21,531
RIGGS: Who's wearing?

516
00:26:21,612 --> 00:26:22,931
Roger, you are.

517
00:26:23,012 --> 00:26:24,889
Why me? You guys should be wearing.

518
00:26:24,972 --> 00:26:27,008
SQUAD MEMBER:
Mr. Murtaugh, let me assist you.

519
00:26:27,092 --> 00:26:29,367
I don't need help.
I've been dressing myself since I was 30.

520
00:26:29,452 --> 00:26:31,727
- Okay, man, just trying to help.
- Get back.

521
00:26:31,812 --> 00:26:33,404
All you perverts, turn your heads.

522
00:26:33,492 --> 00:26:36,245
COP 3: Take it off, baby!
ROGER: Hold this shirt.

523
00:26:37,212 --> 00:26:39,043
SQUAD MEMBER: You're wearing a girdle!

524
00:26:39,132 --> 00:26:41,202
- He's got a girdle!
- This is not a girdle.

525
00:26:41,292 --> 00:26:43,408
ROGER: This is not a girdle. It's my back!

526
00:26:43,492 --> 00:26:45,130
<i>My back went out on me.</i>

527
00:26:46,092 --> 00:26:49,971
I hurt my back this morning lifting weights.
What're you talking about?

528
00:26:50,092 --> 00:26:51,445
RIGGS: I saw him do it.

529
00:26:51,532 --> 00:26:52,567
Everybody, listen up.

530
00:26:52,652 --> 00:26:55,689
I want you all to look at
these... Iovely bullets.

531
00:26:55,852 --> 00:26:56,568
Cute.

532
00:26:56,652 --> 00:27:00,042
Notice the smooth jacket.
Pay particular attention to the tip.

533
00:27:04,572 --> 00:27:07,928
Now you've all seen these vests
stop a.357 magnum bullet.

534
00:27:08,012 --> 00:27:09,843
ALL: Yeah.
RIGGS: Okay.

535
00:27:12,212 --> 00:27:13,440
Observe.

536
00:27:15,012 --> 00:27:16,365
[Gun blast]

537
00:27:17,292 --> 00:27:18,964
[Gun chamber clicks]

538
00:27:19,052 --> 00:27:20,770
[Pulley mechanism hums]

539
00:27:27,852 --> 00:27:29,649
RIGGS: Son of a bitch!

540
00:27:31,212 --> 00:27:34,284
COP 1: Armor-piercing bullets?
RIGGS: Yeah, cop killers.

541
00:27:35,212 --> 00:27:38,682
Those bullets came from the gun
of a suspect we arrested yesterday.

542
00:27:38,772 --> 00:27:40,888
They're out there on the streets.

543
00:27:41,012 --> 00:27:44,084
Vests are optional, boys and girls.
Especially boys.

544
00:27:44,452 --> 00:27:45,726
See you, Riggs.

545
00:27:48,252 --> 00:27:49,731
ROGER: Cop killers.

546
00:27:51,612 --> 00:27:53,648
[Whispers] Son of a bitch.

547
00:27:55,732 --> 00:28:00,328
I think we should talk to Billy Phelps.
I'll have him brought in for interrogation.

548
00:28:08,252 --> 00:28:10,641
I'm here to talk to Billy Phelps.

549
00:28:10,852 --> 00:28:13,241
- Can I see your ID, please?
- Sure.

550
00:28:13,692 --> 00:28:17,048
William Phelps, armored car suspect.
He's been moved to Interrogation.

551
00:28:17,132 --> 00:28:20,329
- Do you know where that is?
- Sure. I've been there a lot.

552
00:28:29,092 --> 00:28:30,650
ROGER: Same floor.

553
00:28:32,012 --> 00:28:35,368
[Whispers] I guess now you're retiring,
that Swiss bank account...

554
00:28:35,452 --> 00:28:37,443
...will come in pretty handy.

555
00:28:37,532 --> 00:28:40,171
How much you got in there, a million?
Million and a half?

556
00:28:40,252 --> 00:28:42,004
ROGER: Five.
RIGGS: Five?

557
00:28:42,372 --> 00:28:44,124
Well, you deserve it.

558
00:28:44,292 --> 00:28:47,443
It's better than those
miserable drug dealers getting it.

559
00:28:51,052 --> 00:28:52,770
What're you talking about?

560
00:28:53,092 --> 00:28:56,721
Don't sweat it. You laundered it,
didn't you? They can't trace it.

561
00:28:57,052 --> 00:28:58,849
RIGGS: They can't trace it.
ROGER: What?

562
00:28:58,932 --> 00:29:02,129
So long as I get an invite
to <i>Casa de</i> Murtaugh, I'm happy.

563
00:29:02,212 --> 00:29:03,406
<i>Casa</i> what?

564
00:29:03,532 --> 00:29:05,488
- I've never been to Portugal.
- Stop joking.

565
00:29:05,572 --> 00:29:06,687
She's a cop!

566
00:29:06,772 --> 00:29:09,809
I know she's a cop.
She's probably on the take, too.

567
00:29:10,932 --> 00:29:12,570
The whole Force is bent.

568
00:29:12,892 --> 00:29:15,281
RIGGS: She may be wearing a skirt,
but we're all brothers.

569
00:29:15,372 --> 00:29:18,364
You know I have nothing.
I ain't been to Portugal.

570
00:29:19,052 --> 00:29:20,804
RIGGS: Listen to me.

571
00:29:23,932 --> 00:29:26,127
LORNA: [Whispers] Son of a bitch.

572
00:29:26,452 --> 00:29:28,363
OFFICER: How're you doing?
LORNA: Fine.

573
00:29:28,452 --> 00:29:31,444
OFFICER: Who is it today?
RIGGS & LORNA: Billy Phelps.

574
00:29:31,892 --> 00:29:32,927
Who're you?

575
00:29:33,012 --> 00:29:35,651
Fly me. I'm your friendly
Portuguese airline.

576
00:29:35,932 --> 00:29:37,411
She's Infernal Affairs, Rog.

577
00:29:37,492 --> 00:29:38,766
LORNA: How'd you know?

578
00:29:38,852 --> 00:29:41,650
I took the liberty
of looking at your file folder.

579
00:29:42,492 --> 00:29:43,641
Lorna Cole.

580
00:29:44,532 --> 00:29:47,285
- And you're Sergeant Murtaugh.
- I used to be.

581
00:29:47,452 --> 00:29:50,205
What's Infernal Repairs
want with our collar?

582
00:29:50,492 --> 00:29:52,164
We're taking over, thanks.

583
00:29:52,252 --> 00:29:53,970
Nobody told us they were taking over.

584
00:29:54,052 --> 00:29:55,929
Nobody has to tell you anything,
Patrolman.

585
00:29:56,012 --> 00:29:57,365
I want to go and see the captain.

586
00:29:57,452 --> 00:30:00,171
You want to see the captain?
Let's go see the captain.

587
00:30:00,252 --> 00:30:03,289
LORNA: And put on a vest.
RIGGS: Oh, are you wearing one?

588
00:30:03,372 --> 00:30:05,363
ROGER: Just take it easy, man.

589
00:30:07,452 --> 00:30:09,204
[Riggs sighs deeply]

590
00:30:09,652 --> 00:30:10,971
[Elevator rings]

591
00:30:17,212 --> 00:30:20,284
Hey, guys. Phelps, William.
Actually, his name's Billy.

592
00:30:20,532 --> 00:30:21,806
OFFICER: You, too?

593
00:30:21,892 --> 00:30:23,883
OFFICER: Popular guy today.
JACK: Somebody with him?

594
00:30:23,972 --> 00:30:26,850
No, not really.
He's down the hall to the right.

595
00:30:27,012 --> 00:30:28,968
Want to sign in here, Sarge?

596
00:30:29,532 --> 00:30:30,647
RIGGS: Miss.

597
00:30:31,452 --> 00:30:33,204
RIGGS: What's Internal Affairs doing here?

598
00:30:33,292 --> 00:30:35,044
MURPHY: Don't start.
I just found out myself.

599
00:30:35,132 --> 00:30:37,168
This is Herman Walters,
Chief of Intelligence.

600
00:30:37,252 --> 00:30:39,243
You haven't met his daughter,
Lorna Doone.

601
00:30:39,332 --> 00:30:40,890
LORNA: Pleased to meet you.

602
00:30:40,972 --> 00:30:43,645
The Phelps case has been transferred
to Internal Affairs.

603
00:30:43,732 --> 00:30:44,562
RIGGS: Why?

604
00:30:44,652 --> 00:30:46,608
MURPHY: I can't tell you.
WALTERS: That's classified.

605
00:30:46,692 --> 00:30:49,206
We busted our buns busting this guy.
We busted him.

606
00:30:49,292 --> 00:30:51,408
Busted is right.
He spent the night in the hospital.

607
00:30:51,492 --> 00:30:53,528
ROGER: He didn't buckle up.
RIGGS: We even cited him.

608
00:30:53,612 --> 00:30:55,443
I know, I read your report.

609
00:30:55,612 --> 00:30:58,445
LORNA: Our cases have, unfortunately,
crossed paths here.

610
00:30:58,532 --> 00:31:00,887
That's all I can say.
We'll take over from here.

611
00:31:00,972 --> 00:31:03,202
Captain, what is she talking about here?

612
00:31:03,292 --> 00:31:05,886
WALTERS: That's classified.
ROGER: No, I'm talking to him.

613
00:31:05,972 --> 00:31:07,371
I'm telling you...

614
00:31:07,452 --> 00:31:09,807
No, I said, "Captain."
I'm talking to the captain.

615
00:31:09,892 --> 00:31:12,770
WALTERS: That's classified!
ROGER: I'm talking to him!

616
00:31:12,852 --> 00:31:15,082
RIGGS: That's bullshit!
MURPHY: Riggs!

617
00:31:16,452 --> 00:31:19,012
MURPHY: Maybe these guys can contribute
something to this case?

618
00:31:19,092 --> 00:31:22,289
From their records,
they only contribute mayhem and chaos.

619
00:31:22,452 --> 00:31:24,682
No, I'm Chaos, he's Mayhem.
We're a double act.

620
00:31:24,772 --> 00:31:26,603
What are we,
required reading or something?

621
00:31:26,692 --> 00:31:28,091
As a matter of fact, you are.

622
00:31:28,172 --> 00:31:31,164
It's a cross between <i>Police Gazette</i>
and <i>Mad</i> magazine.

623
00:31:31,252 --> 00:31:34,085
RIGGS: What's wrong with <i>Mad</i>?
LORNA: Nothing, I used to read it...

624
00:31:34,172 --> 00:31:35,685
You've got some taste.

625
00:31:35,772 --> 00:31:37,091
...when I was 12.

626
00:31:38,212 --> 00:31:39,725
Riggs, let's go.

627
00:31:39,812 --> 00:31:41,723
ROGER: We busted him,
we can talk to him.

628
00:31:41,812 --> 00:31:44,042
WALTERS: Captain.
MURPHY: Riggs. Murtaugh.

629
00:31:44,132 --> 00:31:46,202
MURPHY: Get your asses back here.

630
00:31:49,172 --> 00:31:50,844
You'll be needing these.

631
00:31:51,572 --> 00:31:53,483
I'm reinstating both of you.

632
00:31:53,972 --> 00:31:56,440
ROGER: Don't you just love him?
RIGGS: Yeah.

633
00:31:56,532 --> 00:31:57,647
ROGER: God!

634
00:31:59,572 --> 00:32:01,085
You really are a beautiful man.

635
00:32:01,172 --> 00:32:02,764
Just get rid of the blues.

636
00:32:02,852 --> 00:32:06,322
MURPHY: They don't go with your ponytail.
RIGGS: Absolutely not.

637
00:32:07,212 --> 00:32:08,361
RIGGS: Yeah, right.

638
00:32:08,452 --> 00:32:09,487
Get a haircut!

639
00:32:09,572 --> 00:32:10,687
Of course, I won't.

640
00:32:10,772 --> 00:32:12,842
WALTERS: You've exceeded your authority,
Captain.

641
00:32:12,932 --> 00:32:15,526
MURPHY: That's not how I see it.
WALTERS: That's how the chief will see it.

642
00:32:15,612 --> 00:32:17,489
- Take it up with him.
- I think I will.

643
00:32:17,572 --> 00:32:21,167
Catch up with them. We don't want this
screwed up with cowboy tactics.

644
00:32:21,252 --> 00:32:22,446
Son of a bitch.

645
00:32:24,772 --> 00:32:25,807
Hi, Billy.

646
00:32:28,772 --> 00:32:29,727
Jack!

647
00:32:29,812 --> 00:32:30,927
Bye, Billy.

648
00:32:31,012 --> 00:32:33,162
[Multiple silenced gunshots]

649
00:32:38,212 --> 00:32:39,725
See you, Billy.

650
00:32:46,212 --> 00:32:48,089
OFFICER: Sergeant,
did you get what you need?

651
00:32:48,172 --> 00:32:50,686
Not really. It's a dead issue, I'm afraid.

652
00:32:52,252 --> 00:32:54,288
RIGGS: How long has Phelps
been doing this?

653
00:32:54,372 --> 00:32:57,091
LORNA: Doing what?
RIGGS: This armored-car thing.

654
00:32:57,252 --> 00:33:00,164
I wouldn't know.
I'm not interested in armored cars.

655
00:33:12,972 --> 00:33:15,247
I don't think she's telling us everything.

656
00:33:15,332 --> 00:33:16,560
I think you're right.

657
00:33:16,652 --> 00:33:19,212
Boy, these six days are going to be rough.

658
00:33:19,292 --> 00:33:21,010
ROGER: God, be good to me.

659
00:33:23,252 --> 00:33:26,767
MURPHY: Shit, son of a bitch knew
there was a camera in the wall.

660
00:33:27,532 --> 00:33:28,169
Damn it!

661
00:33:28,252 --> 00:33:30,812
He didn't know there was one
in the interrogation room.

662
00:33:30,892 --> 00:33:32,291
ROGER: There isn't.

663
00:33:32,372 --> 00:33:34,363
LORNA: We installed them six months ago.

664
00:33:34,452 --> 00:33:36,522
LORNA: Every station.
MURPHY: That's great.

665
00:33:36,612 --> 00:33:38,967
Six months and we don't know about it?

666
00:33:39,052 --> 00:33:40,644
This is the "police police," Captain.

667
00:33:40,732 --> 00:33:44,088
"Police police." Very good. Can you say
that three times in a row, real fast?

668
00:33:44,172 --> 00:33:46,481
RIGGS: Why? Am I getting to you?
LORNA: Are you trying to bait me?

669
00:33:46,572 --> 00:33:47,925
I'm a master at it.

670
00:33:48,012 --> 00:33:49,206
That figures.

671
00:33:49,292 --> 00:33:51,886
Baiting master. Great, man,
try all the tricks.

672
00:33:51,972 --> 00:33:53,610
Freeze that. Stop it.

673
00:33:53,732 --> 00:33:55,211
MURPHY: Jack Travis.

674
00:33:55,292 --> 00:33:56,202
BOTH: Who?

675
00:33:56,292 --> 00:33:58,522
Lieutenant Jack Edward Travis.

676
00:33:58,972 --> 00:34:00,087
He was one of us.

677
00:34:00,172 --> 00:34:03,642
MURPHY: Hell of a brutal cop.
He could beat a confession out of anyone.

678
00:34:03,732 --> 00:34:04,608
A dirty cop.

679
00:34:04,692 --> 00:34:06,683
LORNA: I've never seen
so many suspensions...

680
00:34:06,772 --> 00:34:08,763
<i>... and reprimands and charges</i>
<i>of misconduct.</i>

681
00:34:08,852 --> 00:34:11,082
He's also as tough as they come.

682
00:34:11,612 --> 00:34:12,840
What happened to him?

683
00:34:12,932 --> 00:34:14,047
I don't know.

684
00:34:14,132 --> 00:34:17,727
His partner and him were on a stakeout.
He went for coffee, never came back.

685
00:34:17,812 --> 00:34:20,280
Looks like he's had
one cappuccino too many.

686
00:34:20,452 --> 00:34:22,170
We'd better brief Walters.

687
00:34:22,532 --> 00:34:24,602
LORNA: Excuse me, cute stuff.

688
00:34:24,772 --> 00:34:27,923
RIGGS: That's harassment.
ROGER: Cute stuff. That's you.

689
00:34:28,012 --> 00:34:31,368
RIGGS: Captain.
LORNA: Boys, boys. Just the captain.

690
00:34:31,492 --> 00:34:34,848
Your involvement in this case ended
when Phelps hit the floor.

691
00:34:35,012 --> 00:34:37,731
Why don't you just go back
and beat your street?

692
00:34:38,212 --> 00:34:41,010
LEO: Now's the time to buy.
MURPHY: Not now.

693
00:34:41,172 --> 00:34:43,163
- Hey, Roger, Roger!
- Not now, Leo!

694
00:34:43,252 --> 00:34:45,812
- Not now!
- We got to talk, babe, okay?

695
00:34:45,892 --> 00:34:47,723
You're in trouble. You've got termites.

696
00:34:47,812 --> 00:34:49,006
Termites?

697
00:34:49,332 --> 00:34:51,368
- Oh, God!
- You're infested!

698
00:34:52,132 --> 00:34:53,770
The only thing holding up your house
is the paint.

699
00:34:53,852 --> 00:34:54,921
We should go.

700
00:34:55,012 --> 00:34:57,162
Leo, could you get the place fumigated?

701
00:34:57,252 --> 00:34:59,561
We should pull every file on this guy.

702
00:34:59,652 --> 00:35:01,961
I know this guy.
Are you watching <i>Geraldo</i>?

703
00:35:02,052 --> 00:35:03,201
RIGGS: What?
LEO: I know the guy.

704
00:35:03,292 --> 00:35:05,931
RIGGS: How do you know him?
LEO: I've seen the guy before.

705
00:35:06,012 --> 00:35:08,207
ROGER: Where?
LEO: I don't know. I recognize him...

706
00:35:08,292 --> 00:35:10,886
His name is Jack Travis.
Does that ring a bell?

707
00:35:11,812 --> 00:35:13,689
Hands off the clothes. Okay?

708
00:35:14,052 --> 00:35:15,883
I'm thinking. Let me think.

709
00:35:16,612 --> 00:35:18,125
It was a big party.

710
00:35:18,212 --> 00:35:21,329
Someone brought a monkey
that knocked over the salad bar.

711
00:35:21,492 --> 00:35:24,609
And this guy comes in
and introduces me to another guy...

712
00:35:24,772 --> 00:35:26,524
...who wants a favor.

713
00:35:27,012 --> 00:35:28,684
- I got it! I got it!
- What?

714
00:35:28,892 --> 00:35:29,927
He's got it!

715
00:35:30,052 --> 00:35:31,770
- I remember!
- You remember!

716
00:35:32,132 --> 00:35:34,726
Don't do it. Don't let the earring fool you.

717
00:35:35,252 --> 00:35:37,447
- We're back. We're back!
- Yeah. Yeah.

718
00:35:37,532 --> 00:35:38,567
Listen, listen.

719
00:35:38,652 --> 00:35:40,210
Can I have a gun this time?

720
00:35:40,292 --> 00:35:41,725
[Echoing] No!

721
00:35:42,572 --> 00:35:44,642

[Scattered cheering, hollering]

723
00:35:50,492 --> 00:35:54,724
Okay, this is it! These guys always
wanted me to do favors for them!

724
00:35:55,372 --> 00:35:58,967
Like, some guys wanted broads,
another guy wanted Cuban cigars.

725
00:35:59,132 --> 00:36:00,770
Your guy, hockey!

726
00:36:00,972 --> 00:36:03,042
LEO: The best seats in the house!

727
00:36:05,292 --> 00:36:07,567
RIGGS: Where're the seats?
ROGER: Yeah?

728
00:36:08,212 --> 00:36:10,043
Probably by the glass.

729
00:36:10,892 --> 00:36:13,201
Does "needle in a haystack"
mean anything to you?

730
00:36:13,292 --> 00:36:14,725
Why don't we spread out?

731
00:36:14,812 --> 00:36:18,566
If we all take a different direction,
it'd be like old times.

732
00:36:19,332 --> 00:36:22,130
Don't push, lady!
I'm on police business here!

733
00:36:22,212 --> 00:36:23,884
Just take it easy!

Excuse me.

You're all right, pal. Stay calm.

LEO: Make sure you tell my mother!

771
00:39:14,932 --> 00:39:16,206
Where'd he go?

772
00:39:16,292 --> 00:39:17,441
Down there!

773
00:39:27,452 --> 00:39:29,090
Son of a... bitch!

774
00:39:32,132 --> 00:39:34,726
He thinks I don't know I'm dying.
I know it.

ROGER: You'll be okay.
LEO: I'm dying, Roger.

776
00:39:38,612 --> 00:39:40,091
I'm choking, see?

777

I'm going to die, I know it! What?

781
00:39:51,132 --> 00:39:52,804
You're lying on the ice.

ROGER: That's why you're cold.

783

- That's why I'm numb?
- That's why you're numb.

784
00:39:59,612 --> 00:40:01,330
But he shot me. Look at all the blood.

785
00:40:01,412 --> 00:40:04,210
ROGER: It's just a flesh wound.
LEO: So it's okay.

786

LEO: I can't believe this.

LEO: I can't believe I got shot.
DOCTOR: Calm down.

790

Riggs, are you here?

791
00:40:25,612 --> 00:40:28,251
We're all the same now. We all got shot.

792

DOCTOR: You'll be fine.

793
00:40:30,252 --> 00:40:31,162
Relax.

I can take this.

We'll take care of it. Aah!

It's no big deal.

797
00:40:38,372 --> 00:40:40,806
This isn't a good idea.
You shouldn't rush this, Doc.

798

RIGGS: You should rest up.

799
00:40:42,332 --> 00:40:44,243
A dum-dum wound can be serious.

800
00:40:44,372 --> 00:40:46,044
What's a "dum-dum wound"?

801
00:40:46,372 --> 00:40:50,206
You don't know? A guy on the Force
got his thumb shot off by a dum-dum.

802
00:40:50,292 --> 00:40:52,487
From the shock,
he was dead two days later.

803
00:40:52,572 --> 00:40:54,005
Dead two days later?

804
00:40:54,092 --> 00:40:55,571
LEO: He died from dum-dums?

805
00:40:55,652 --> 00:40:58,086
DOCTOR: We'll keep you overnight.
ROGER: Make it two.

806
00:40:58,172 --> 00:40:59,127
Two days?

807
00:40:59,212 --> 00:41:00,850
Okay, we'll keep him two days.

808
00:41:00,932 --> 00:41:02,081
Is that Leo's chart?

809
00:41:02,172 --> 00:41:04,561
DOCTOR: Two days,
then you'll be as good as new.

810
00:41:04,652 --> 00:41:06,210
LEO: I should be with them.

811
00:41:06,292 --> 00:41:08,044
I should be with... Ow, ow!

812
00:41:08,612 --> 00:41:10,204
How do you spell, "proctological"?

813
00:41:10,292 --> 00:41:11,805
ROGER: Rectal exam?

814
00:41:12,252 --> 00:41:15,050
- No, you can't do that to Leo.
- Sure, we can.

815
00:41:15,132 --> 00:41:15,928
Why's she...

816
00:41:16,012 --> 00:41:17,365
Please, Mr. Getz.

817
00:41:17,452 --> 00:41:21,001
DOCTOR: You've been shot in the arm?
Let her take it. You'll get it back.

818
00:41:21,092 --> 00:41:23,322
DOCTOR: There's a clock in your room.

819
00:41:24,412 --> 00:41:26,084
Does this look like a "dum-dum wound"?

820
00:41:26,172 --> 00:41:28,208
RIGGS: It sounded like one
when it happened.

821
00:41:28,292 --> 00:41:29,281

822
00:41:29,372 --> 00:41:30,964

No problem.

RIGGS: We won't make a move
without you.

826
00:41:36,292 --> 00:41:37,884
I thought that bullet sounded different.

827
00:41:37,972 --> 00:41:40,122
DOCTOR: Relax.
They'll be there when you get out.

828
00:41:40,212 --> 00:41:41,201
LEO: I'm fine.

829
00:41:41,292 --> 00:41:43,248
LEO: You own your house, Doc?
DOCTOR: What?

830
00:41:43,332 --> 00:41:45,163
- You don't recognize my face?
- No, sir.

831
00:41:45,252 --> 00:41:45,923
Watch.

832
00:41:46,772 --> 00:41:50,367
RIGGS: It's about time. These doggy treats
are okay, but I need some human food.

833
00:41:50,452 --> 00:41:54,047
ROGER: Don't worry. I'll make you
the best thing you've ever had.

834
00:41:54,252 --> 00:41:55,651
RIGGS: Good.

835
00:41:56,172 --> 00:41:58,163
ROGER: You ever eat
one of my hamburgers?

836
00:41:58,252 --> 00:42:00,163
RIGGS: I've been lucky so far.

837
00:42:01,052 --> 00:42:02,451
ROGER: Fast Eddie!

838
00:42:02,812 --> 00:42:04,564
ROGER: How's business?
EDDIE: Booming. Can't you tell?

839
00:42:04,652 --> 00:42:07,041
ROGER: Yeah, I'm looking at it.
Did you meet my partner?

840
00:42:07,132 --> 00:42:09,805
I want to cook one
of those monster burgers for him.

841
00:42:09,892 --> 00:42:11,245
EDDIE: Go for it.
ROGER: All right.

842
00:42:11,332 --> 00:42:13,323
RIGGS: You'll let him cook?
EDDIE: Do I have a choice?

843
00:42:13,412 --> 00:42:15,607
ROGER: No, because it's Wednesday.

844
00:42:15,772 --> 00:42:17,285
RIGGS: He's too big to argue with.

845
00:42:17,372 --> 00:42:19,283
In that case, give me a MacRog.

846
00:42:19,412 --> 00:42:20,925
RIGGS: Hold the hair.

847
00:42:21,412 --> 00:42:22,561
Did you wash your hands?

848

LORNA: Right.

1189
01:01:14,532 --> 01:01:15,487
Not too close.

1190
01:01:15,572 --> 01:01:17,563
Riggs, if he were that close, I'd be dead.

1191
01:01:17,652 --> 01:01:19,608
I can beat it. I can beat it.

1192
01:01:20,572 --> 01:01:22,688
- I'll take your word for it.
- You gotta see this.

1193
01:01:22,772 --> 01:01:24,285
LORNA: I believe you.
RIGGS: This guy had a knife.

1194
01:01:24,372 --> 01:01:28,445
RIGGS: You'll love it. He stuck it in my leg
and ran it around eight times.

1195
01:01:29,052 --> 01:01:31,168
LORNA: I'll take your word for it.
RIGGS: Look!

1196
01:01:31,252 --> 01:01:32,367
No, I said forget it.

1197
01:01:32,452 --> 01:01:34,010
This is a blue-ribbon event.

1198
01:01:34,092 --> 01:01:35,445
Forget it, Riggs.

1199
01:01:36,332 --> 01:01:37,367
You started this.

1200
01:01:37,452 --> 01:01:40,171
LORNA: Yeah, I can end it.
RIGGS: You know what?

1201
01:01:40,492 --> 01:01:42,164
You're a very poor loser.

1202
01:01:43,212 --> 01:01:44,406
I didn't lose.

1203
01:01:44,652 --> 01:01:46,244
RIGGS: Yes, you did.
LORNA: No, I didn't lose.

1204
01:01:46,332 --> 01:01:47,924
RIGGS: You lost.
LORNA: I conceded.

1205
01:01:48,012 --> 01:01:50,321
No, I conceded. There's a difference
between losing and conceding.

1206
01:01:50,412 --> 01:01:52,368
You conceded or you're conceited?

1207
01:01:52,452 --> 01:01:54,408
LORNA: You think I'm conceited?
RIGGS: Yeah.

1208
01:01:54,492 --> 01:01:56,562
Tell me you lost. Admit to it.

1209
01:01:56,652 --> 01:01:57,767
I'll get you a Band-Aid.

1210
01:01:57,852 --> 01:02:01,049

LORNA: I said, "don't touch anything."

the shit out of me, right?

01:02:15,372 --> 01:02:17,203
I can do better than that.

1214
01:02:33,612 --> 01:02:36,251
This could be a serious ethical breach here.

1215

with another sergeant before.

ROGER: What do you want?

1222
01:03:42,092 --> 01:03:44,481
I just wanted to see how you were doing.

1223
01:03:44,572 --> 01:03:46,324
Who sent you? Trish?

1224
01:03:46,852 --> 01:03:48,729
You're doing pretty well.
Trish didn't send me.

- Yeah.

Those guys from the garage,
they're all ex-cons.

1532
01:19:09,292 --> 01:19:13,365
They were all busted by the same
police officer, Jack Edward Travis.

the work-furlough program.

Mesa Verde Construction.

You don't have a pass.

- My pass?

1537

Here's my pass.

Don't mention the hospital.

- Brain surgery?
- A lapotomy.

1546
01:19:39,852 --> 01:19:42,127
Not a lobotomy.
Cut your hair so you can hear.

What's the difference?

1548
01:19:43,372 --> 01:19:47,126
The difference is, for a lapotomy,
they shave your nether regions.

1549
01:19:47,292 --> 01:19:48,407
Nether what?

1550
