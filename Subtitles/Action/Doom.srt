1
00:00:07,974 --> 00:00:09,532
In the year 2026...

2
00:00:09,642 --> 00:00:11,701
archaeologists working
in the Nevada desert...

3
00:00:11,811 --> 00:00:15,269
discovered a portal
to an ancient city on Mars.

4
00:00:16,082 --> 00:00:18,141
They called this portal the Ark.

5
00:00:19,619 --> 00:00:22,452
Twenty years later,
we're still struggling to understand...

6
00:00:22,555 --> 00:00:24,352
why it was built...

7
00:00:24,824 --> 00:00:27,691
and what happened
to the civilization that built it.

8
00:01:55,381 --> 00:01:56,939
Dr. Carmack!

9
00:01:58,718 --> 00:01:59,946
Dr. Carmack!

10
00:02:20,773 --> 00:02:24,402
This is Dr. Carmack,
Classified Research, Olduvai, ID 6627.

11
00:02:25,678 --> 00:02:27,612
We've had a Level 5 breach.

12
00:02:27,747 --> 00:02:30,511
Implement quarantine
procedures immediately.

13
00:02:30,617 --> 00:02:33,085
Implement quarantine
procedures now.

14
00:03:00,246 --> 00:03:01,713
Reading you
loud and clear, General.

15
00:03:01,848 --> 00:03:04,783
Union Aerospace has requested
assistance to contain...

16
00:03:04,918 --> 00:03:06,613
a Level 5 breach
at their Olduvai facility.

17
00:03:06,719 --> 00:03:08,380
How many personnel involved?

18
00:03:08,488 --> 00:03:11,286
Six scientists are under
lockdown in a high-security lab...

19
00:03:11,391 --> 00:03:12,585
where the breach occurred.

20
00:03:12,725 --> 00:03:14,852
Another 79 UAC employees
are on site.

21
00:03:16,062 --> 00:03:18,826
Ark travel has been suspended.
What's the objective?

22
00:03:18,932 --> 00:03:21,992
Code red. Assess level of
threat. Assess level of threat.

23
00:03:22,101 --> 00:03:24,035
Protect and retrieve
UAC property.

24
00:03:24,137 --> 00:03:27,004
Maintain quarantine at both
Ark portals by any means necessary.

25
00:03:27,106 --> 00:03:29,574
Use extreme prejudice?
Extreme prejudice.

26
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:32,473
If necessary,
search and destroy. Over.

27
00:03:32,579 --> 00:03:34,012
Search and destroy.

28
00:03:34,514 --> 00:03:36,744
Orders received
and understood. Out.

29
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:40,583
Oh, you're trying to get
nasty now, huh?

30
00:03:40,687 --> 00:03:43,554
Now you dead. You dead,
sucker. All right, all right.

31
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:46,454
You wanna bring your boys?
You wanna bring your boys?

32
00:03:46,759 --> 00:03:47,851
I don't believe this.

33
00:03:49,262 --> 00:03:51,253
I confess to God the father.

34
00:04:00,506 --> 00:04:01,803
Oh, yeah!

35
00:04:02,842 --> 00:04:05,572
I need help.
The wall, man.

36
00:04:05,678 --> 00:04:07,475
I don't believe this shit.

37
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:08,672
Six months
without a weekend...

38
00:04:08,815 --> 00:04:11,443
the goddamned transporters
are five minutes late.

39
00:04:11,551 --> 00:04:14,884
And that's five minutes of
R and R I ain't never gonna get back.

40
00:04:14,988 --> 00:04:17,582
Hey, relax, baby.
We're on vacation.

41
00:04:21,794 --> 00:04:24,160
Yo.
This game's layered, man.

42
00:04:28,468 --> 00:04:31,835
Where you going, Portman?
I'm going down to El Honto...

43
00:04:31,938 --> 00:04:34,634
and I'm gonna lock myself
in a motel room...

44
00:04:34,774 --> 00:04:37,743
with a bottle of tequila
and three she-boys.

45
00:04:40,079 --> 00:04:41,478
You're sick, man.

46
00:04:45,818 --> 00:04:49,083
I'm sick of your filth, Portman.
He speaks.

47
00:04:49,455 --> 00:04:50,513
What's it gonna be, Reaps?

48
00:04:50,657 --> 00:04:52,090
An armed conflict
someplace quiet?

49
00:04:52,191 --> 00:04:55,558
Yeah, a little relaxing
jungle warfare?

50
00:04:56,429 --> 00:04:58,021
Or maybe you're just gonna
stay right here.

51
00:04:58,131 --> 00:04:59,564
Spending my time
doing pushups.

52
00:04:59,699 --> 00:05:01,189
Listen up, men.

53
00:05:03,603 --> 00:05:05,264
Leave is canceled.

54
00:05:05,805 --> 00:05:09,400
Oh, man. I just...
I don't believe this shit.

55
00:05:10,677 --> 00:05:12,611
Fuck!
Got a problem with that, Duke?

56
00:05:12,745 --> 00:05:15,009
Me, Sarge?
Hell, no, I love my job.

57
00:05:15,114 --> 00:05:17,309
What's up, Sarge?
We got us a game.

58
00:05:19,385 --> 00:05:20,317
Kid!

59
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:23,755
Son, you are now
in the Rapid Response Tactical Squad...

60
00:05:23,856 --> 00:05:25,050
the RRTS.

61
00:05:27,193 --> 00:05:28,125
Fall in.

62
00:05:31,731 --> 00:05:34,029
All dressed up and
nowhere to go, huh, Portman?

63
00:05:35,468 --> 00:05:38,960
Kid, don't forget your rattle.
Shut up, Portman.

64
00:05:40,873 --> 00:05:42,864
Not this time, John.
What?

65
00:05:43,676 --> 00:05:46,440
We can handle this one.
You're bullshitting me.

66
00:05:47,714 --> 00:05:50,274
No, I'm not bullshitting.
We're going to Olduvai.

67
00:05:52,752 --> 00:05:53,684
Olduvai?

68
00:05:58,658 --> 00:06:01,149
Take the leave.
Is that an order?

69
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:04,193
It's a recommendation.

70
00:06:05,365 --> 00:06:06,992
See you when I get back.

71
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:13,263
Aircraft ready to load.
Copy that.

72
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:15,603
Great vacation.
Damn, they go quick.

73
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:17,369
Almost like
we've never been away.

74
00:06:18,277 --> 00:06:19,608
We're a go.

75
00:06:19,712 --> 00:06:21,680
All systems are green.
Prepare for takeoff.

76
00:06:21,781 --> 00:06:23,214
Okay, Sarge, roger.

77
00:06:28,621 --> 00:06:31,055
RRTS Special Ops

78
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:32,987

00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:46,304
"The Kid"?
Handle ID: Duke.

83
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:48,135
Say my name, baby.

84
00:06:49,609 --> 00:06:51,804
RRTS Special Ops

85
00:06:51,911 --> 00:06:54,379
Handle ID: Sarge.

86
00:06:54,514 --> 00:06:56,345
I can't believe
we're going through the Ark.

87
00:06:56,449 --> 00:06:59,850
Don't worry, Kid.
You're gonna love it.

88
00:07:02,288 --> 00:07:03,755
- All set?
- Yes, sir.

89
00:07:11,731 --> 00:07:16,191
RRTS Special Ops
clearance verified. Handle ID: Reaper.

90
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:18,159
Take us up!

91
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:20,535
RRTS air 6,
we're airborne and en route.

92
00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:33,041
You know, Kid, it's funny.

93
00:07:33,953 --> 00:07:36,979
A couple of days ago
I asked Sarge for a little pussy.

94
00:07:38,157 --> 00:07:40,591
The next day he brought you
onto the team.

95
00:07:41,427 --> 00:07:43,827
Don't give me
an excuse, Portman.

96
00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:46,264
No one here will miss you.

97
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:49,696
Men, look in.

98
00:07:50,269 --> 00:07:52,533
This is what we got
from Simcon.

99
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:56,474
We have a quarantine situation
on Olduvai.

100
00:07:56,576 --> 00:07:57,634
They sent this message...

101
00:07:57,777 --> 00:08:00,371
when the research team stopped
responding to all communications.

102
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,572
Olduvai.

103
00:08:01,681 --> 00:08:06,243
This is Dr. Carmack,
Classified Research, Olduvai, ID 6627.

104
00:08:07,286 --> 00:08:08,685
We've had a Level 5 breach.

105
00:08:08,788 --> 00:08:10,949
Implement quarantine procedures
immediately.

106
00:08:11,157 --> 00:08:12,089
I repeat.

107
00:08:12,225 --> 00:08:15,683
This is Dr. Carmack,
Classified Research, Olduvai, ID 6627.

108
00:08:15,828 --> 00:08:18,023
We've had a Level 5 breach.

109
00:08:18,197 --> 00:08:20,097
Implement
quarantine procedures now.

110
00:08:21,534 --> 00:08:23,968
UAC have
shut down the lab, men.

111
00:08:24,103 --> 00:08:25,866
We need to go up there,
locate the team...

112
00:08:25,972 --> 00:08:28,270
eliminate the threat
and secure the facility.

113
00:08:28,441 --> 00:08:29,703
What threat?

114
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:34,473
It goes like this, see: If it's
trying to kill you, it's a threat.

115
00:08:48,094 --> 00:08:50,062
Rescue mission
heading 147 degrees.

116
00:08:50,162 --> 00:08:53,029
Location Lima, Zulu,
Foxtrot 14.

117
00:08:53,132 --> 00:08:55,362
Roger, Q-06. Badger 39 out.

118
00:08:55,501 --> 00:08:56,695
Copy, Badger 39.

119
00:09:06,979 --> 00:09:10,312
How long has it been?
Ten years.

120
00:09:10,416 --> 00:09:12,611
Sure she's even
still up there?

121
00:09:16,822 --> 00:09:17,754
Yeah.

122
00:09:20,126 --> 00:09:22,560
I guess you gotta face
your demon sometime.

123
00:09:26,165 --> 00:09:29,191
Copy, Q-06, we've got
a visual on Lima, Zulu.

124
00:09:29,335 --> 00:09:32,031
ETA at 90 seconds. Stand by.

125
00:09:32,138 --> 00:09:34,834
Look alive, men. Game time.

126
00:10:00,933 --> 00:10:01,865
Halt.

127
00:10:25,057 --> 00:10:25,989
Move in.

128
00:10:38,738 --> 00:10:41,172
You hesitate, people die.

129
00:11:00,559 --> 00:11:01,753
I checked it...

130
00:11:01,894 --> 00:11:04,419
at least three times
before we sent it through.

131
00:11:05,364 --> 00:11:08,094
Sanford Crosby,
UAC Public Relations.

132
00:11:10,136 --> 00:11:12,502
Now follow me, please.
How many people you got up there?

133
00:11:12,605 --> 00:11:16,006
UAC employs 85 permanent
research staff on Olduvai.

134
00:11:20,446 --> 00:11:22,573
Welcome to the Ark, gentlemen.

135
00:11:23,215 --> 00:11:25,581
Initiating
molecular mapping drive.

136
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:27,915
Initiating
molecular mapping drive.

137
00:11:31,223 --> 00:11:33,657
All personnel,
prepare for activation.

138
00:11:35,027 --> 00:11:38,292
Keep your distance from the
core or you might get sucked in.

139
00:11:38,497 --> 00:11:40,931
You, uh, you done this before?

140
00:11:41,067 --> 00:11:43,092
Once. Training mission.

141
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:45,265
Hope you had a good dinner,
Kid.

142
00:11:45,404 --> 00:11:47,702
Inter-planet coordinate
lock engaged.

143
00:11:48,874 --> 00:11:51,900
All telemetry verified
and transmissions are five-by-five.

144
00:11:52,011 --> 00:11:54,741
Soon as we get through, I need you to
shut down the surface elevator here.

145
00:11:54,847 --> 00:11:57,042
Make sure that we get
the standard quarantine of six hours.

146
00:11:57,149 --> 00:11:59,845
Target receiver initialized.
Ready to proceed.

147
00:12:01,153 --> 00:12:04,589
Ark travel,
15 seconds and counting.

148
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,693
Five, four...

149
00:12:17,536 --> 00:12:19,367
three, two...

150
00:12:20,172 --> 00:12:21,104
one.

151
00:12:33,252 --> 00:12:34,810
Why we gotta come
all this way?

152
00:12:35,321 --> 00:12:38,313
Why can't UAC rent-a-cops
take care of this bullshit?

153
00:12:38,457 --> 00:12:40,186
Is it always that rough?

154
00:12:40,292 --> 00:12:42,658
Believe me,
it used to be a lot rougher.

155
00:12:43,129 --> 00:12:46,724
There was a time when Ark travel
was susceptible to, let's say...

156
00:12:46,866 --> 00:12:49,630
major turbulence.
What's he mean?

157
00:12:50,236 --> 00:12:53,672
He means he went
to one galaxy, his ass went to another.

158
00:12:55,674 --> 00:12:58,199
Call it
a scientific miscalculation.

159
00:12:58,811 --> 00:13:03,043
Unbelievable as it may seem,
UAC does make the odd tiny mistake.

160
00:13:03,883 --> 00:13:06,750
Marcus Pinzerowsky.
You call me Pinky. Follow me.

161
00:13:07,153 --> 00:13:09,621
Where are the personnel who
aren't locked down in the lab?

162
00:13:09,755 --> 00:13:10,687
In the atrium.

163
00:13:10,823 --> 00:13:12,791
Pinky, put us up.

164
00:13:13,793 --> 00:13:16,159
Activating remote personnel
surveillance.

165
00:13:19,698 --> 00:13:21,791
Circle out men, on my three.

166
00:13:22,501 --> 00:13:24,731
One, two, three.

167
00:13:26,806 --> 00:13:28,933
Killcams up and running.

168
00:13:29,909 --> 00:13:32,173
People, this room
is a code red, which means...

169
00:13:32,278 --> 00:13:33,905
no one gets in
without our permission.

170
00:13:34,046 --> 00:13:35,274
It stays ours at all costs.

171
00:13:35,381 --> 00:13:37,713
Mac, stay here with our friend
and secure the door.

172
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:40,047
Men, on me. Let's move out.

173
00:13:45,324 --> 00:13:46,484
Open the doors.

174
00:14:01,607 --> 00:14:03,234
Who called in the military?

175
00:14:09,648 --> 00:14:11,013
Where the fuck are we?

176
00:14:11,116 --> 00:14:13,584
Couple million light years
from breakfast.

177
00:14:13,719 --> 00:14:15,914
When can I start
evacuating people out through the Ark?

178
00:14:16,021 --> 00:14:18,387
We're at a Level 5 quarantine,
nobody goes anywhere.

179
00:14:18,490 --> 00:14:22,722
Ladies, we're under
a Level 5 quarantine...

180
00:14:22,828 --> 00:14:26,320
so I'm just gonna have to
strip search you girls.

181
00:14:26,432 --> 00:14:29,401
- I don't think so.
- Hold that thought.

182
00:14:29,501 --> 00:14:32,493
We're under a Level 5 quarantine,
so I'm just gonna have...

183
00:14:32,638 --> 00:14:34,333
to strip...
Portman!

184
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:37,238
Sergeant, this is Dr. Samantha Grimm,
the UAC science officer...

185
00:14:37,343 --> 00:14:39,402
assigned to retrieve data
from the lab.

186
00:14:39,511 --> 00:14:41,502
- Sergeant.
- Dr. Grimm.

187
00:14:41,647 --> 00:14:44,047
- Hello, John.
- Hello, Samantha.

188
00:14:44,149 --> 00:14:45,548
Hello, Samantha!

189
00:14:46,485 --> 00:14:48,350
Sarge,
this operation is a code red.

190
00:14:48,454 --> 00:14:50,513
We really don't have room
for passengers.

191
00:14:50,656 --> 00:14:54,057
Excuse me, but I have orders
to retrieve data from three servers:

192
00:14:54,193 --> 00:14:57,424
Anthropology, Forensic Archeology,
and Genetics.

193
00:14:57,563 --> 00:14:59,724
This is a military operation,
Doctor.

194
00:14:59,832 --> 00:15:02,824
We're really not here
to retrieve your science homework.

195
00:15:02,968 --> 00:15:06,699
Look, I got an idea. Why don't you
ask your CO what your orders are?

196
00:15:09,408 --> 00:15:12,172
To contain and neutralize the threat,
protect the civilians...

197
00:15:12,278 --> 00:15:16,078
and retrieve...
retrieve UAC property.

198
00:15:16,682 --> 00:15:19,515
We finally done here?
Because I've got a job to do.

199
00:15:19,852 --> 00:15:22,412
If you'll follow me?
You chose this, Reaper.

200
00:15:24,123 --> 00:15:26,455
Is this gonna spoil my day?
No, sir.

201
00:15:26,558 --> 00:15:28,651
Tell me you didn't let
a fine-looking piece of ass...

202
00:15:28,794 --> 00:15:30,921
like that get away from you,
Reaper. She's my sister.

203
00:15:31,063 --> 00:15:33,031
No shit?
Don't do this again, man.

204
00:15:33,132 --> 00:15:34,064
Do what?

205
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:37,034
There's three sections
to Carmack's lab complex.

206
00:15:37,136 --> 00:15:39,536
Archeology, Genetics,
and Weapons Research.

207
00:15:39,638 --> 00:15:41,572
You test weapons up here?
Well, it's a dead planet.

208
00:15:41,674 --> 00:15:44,541
You want that stuff tested here, where
it's safe, or in your own backyard?

209
00:15:44,643 --> 00:15:47,077
We're primarily
an archeological operation.

210
00:15:47,179 --> 00:15:49,613
Weapons Research is in
its own separate facility.

211
00:15:49,715 --> 00:15:52,081
It has nothing to do
with Dr. Carmack's work.

212
00:15:52,184 --> 00:15:53,811
How many inside
when the lab shut down?

213
00:15:53,919 --> 00:15:56,479
Only Dr. Carmack's team.
That's six people.

214
00:15:56,588 --> 00:15:59,455
In one of the carbon dating
labs, there was an internal phone...

215
00:15:59,558 --> 00:16:00,650
left off the hook.

216
00:16:00,759 --> 00:16:02,989
Did you get any information
from it?

217
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:12,464
Open the door.

218
00:16:23,082 --> 00:16:25,243
Portman, Goat, lead on.

219
00:16:33,592 --> 00:16:36,083
Magnesium, chromium, lead.
It's all normal.

220
00:16:36,228 --> 00:16:37,525
All clear.

221
00:16:41,033 --> 00:16:43,194
Pinky, give us a schematic.

222
00:16:44,269 --> 00:16:46,032
Uploading to you now.

223
00:16:49,975 --> 00:16:52,409
Carmack's lab is isolated
from the rest of the facility.

224
00:16:53,345 --> 00:16:55,677
The airlock is the only way
in or out.

225
00:16:59,118 --> 00:17:00,551
Goat, Portman: Genetics.

226
00:17:00,652 --> 00:17:03,678
Kid, Destroyer: Carmack's office,
where he sent the mayday from.

227
00:17:03,822 --> 00:17:06,586
Reaper, keep Dr. Grimm here
safe on her salvage op.

228
00:17:06,692 --> 00:17:10,628
Duke and I'll take the weapons lab,
make sure all the hardware's secure.

229
00:17:10,763 --> 00:17:12,390
Be safe, gentlemen.

230
00:17:12,898 --> 00:17:14,923
Portman, Goat, on you.
It's on.

231
00:17:27,579 --> 00:17:29,274
- Clear left.
- Clear right.

232
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:38,083
$5 says this shit ain't nothing but
a disgruntled employee with a gun.

233
00:17:40,292 --> 00:17:43,352
Fluorescent markings
as rooms are cleared. Go.

234
00:17:49,368 --> 00:17:51,063
They're on the move.

235
00:17:53,238 --> 00:17:55,035
You don't look like a "Mac".

236
00:17:56,308 --> 00:17:58,902
Katsuhiko Kumanosuke Takaashi.

237
00:18:00,546 --> 00:18:01,979
So, Mac.

238
00:18:53,098 --> 00:18:54,292
What the fuck!

239
00:19:14,653 --> 00:19:17,019
Pinky, you getting this?

240
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:18,282
Jesus.

241
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:19,755
Very cool.

242
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:49,552
Cleared.

243
00:19:50,956 --> 00:19:53,151
Where the hell is everybody?

244
00:19:56,028 --> 00:19:56,960
Hey.

245
00:20:12,244 --> 00:20:13,211
Lock in.

246
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:22,213
It's clear.

247
00:20:25,324 --> 00:20:27,155
How much time you gonna need?

248
00:20:27,259 --> 00:20:29,159
Thirty minutes, tops.

249
00:20:29,728 --> 00:20:31,320
Goat, Portman.

250
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:33,227
There's another room
to the north.

251
00:20:33,332 --> 00:20:34,890
Past Genetics.

252
00:20:36,468 --> 00:20:37,662
Copy that.

253
00:20:56,221 --> 00:20:59,088
What the hell is that?
You never did time, Portman?

254
00:20:59,191 --> 00:21:00,123
What?

255
00:21:02,361 --> 00:21:06,195
This is a holding cell.
Bullshit.

256
00:21:06,932 --> 00:21:08,593
What makes you think that?

257
00:21:10,602 --> 00:21:11,534
Touch it.

258
00:21:16,074 --> 00:21:20,170
'Cause the walls are electrified.
You asshole!

259
00:21:26,018 --> 00:21:28,612
Jeez. They leave shit
like this lying around?

260
00:21:30,188 --> 00:21:32,679
I'd hate to see
what they lock up.

261
00:21:42,334 --> 00:21:43,301
"BFG".

262
00:21:47,272 --> 00:21:49,934
Hey, Sarge, what's the deal
with the sister?

263
00:21:53,178 --> 00:21:55,874
Reaper's parents led the first team
of archeologists to Olduvai.

264
00:21:56,014 --> 00:21:58,574
They died in some accident
when he was a kid.

265
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:03,982
She followed in their
footsteps, and he didn't.

266
00:22:04,289 --> 00:22:07,622
No, what I meant was,
is she single?

267
00:22:12,764 --> 00:22:14,823
Please provide
DNA verification.

268
00:22:19,604 --> 00:22:21,663
Access denied.

269
00:22:58,210 --> 00:22:59,871
All units report contact.

270
00:23:00,545 --> 00:23:02,604
God damn it,
all units report contact.

271
00:23:03,248 --> 00:23:04,180
Hey.

272
00:23:07,319 --> 00:23:08,843
It was moving.

273
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:11,511
Friendly fire, Sarge.
Wasting ghosts.

274
00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:13,924
Roger that. Funny, Duke.

275
00:23:15,193 --> 00:23:17,923
So, "Reaper"? As in "Grim"?

276
00:23:18,630 --> 00:23:20,621
They're Marines, Sam, not poets.

277
00:23:21,533 --> 00:23:23,000
Holy shit!

278
00:23:24,169 --> 00:23:25,568
Oh, yeah, meet Lucy.

279
00:23:25,704 --> 00:23:27,331
Lucy, this is my brother,
John...

280
00:23:27,439 --> 00:23:29,373
another creature
from the long lost past.

281
00:23:29,474 --> 00:23:32,102
You found human remains?
Humanoid.

282
00:23:32,244 --> 00:23:34,769
Lucy and her child
were our first major find.

283
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:36,939
We're bringing out more
every day.

284
00:23:38,383 --> 00:23:42,217
You re-opened the dig?
I know I should have told you.

285
00:23:42,621 --> 00:23:44,555
I didn't figure it was
the sort of thing...

286
00:23:44,689 --> 00:23:47,123
I could jot down on
a yearly birthday card.

287
00:23:47,559 --> 00:23:49,550
It's been stabilized.
Bullshit.

288
00:23:50,028 --> 00:23:52,963
You wanna talk about safe?
Like you took a desk job?

289
00:23:54,666 --> 00:23:57,635
I'm a forensic archeologist,
John. I'll go where the work is.

290
00:23:57,769 --> 00:23:59,794
Is that the only reason
you're up here?

291
00:23:59,938 --> 00:24:01,872
You wanna know
why I'm up here?

292
00:24:02,908 --> 00:24:04,603
I'll show you. Come here.

293
00:24:06,778 --> 00:24:09,770
This is Lucy's chromosome
profile. Notice anything?

294
00:24:11,149 --> 00:24:13,481
My molecular genetics
is a little rusty.

295
00:24:13,718 --> 00:24:16,482
What's the first thing
Dad taught us to look for?

296
00:24:23,795 --> 00:24:26,059
She's got 24 pairs
of chromosomes.

297
00:24:26,164 --> 00:24:29,600
Humans only have 23.
But what does the extra pair do?

298
00:24:29,734 --> 00:24:31,258
Makes her superhuman.

299
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:33,461
The extra pair makes
her super strong...

300
00:24:33,605 --> 00:24:36,005
super fit, super intelligent.

301
00:24:36,308 --> 00:24:38,833
Her cells divide
50 times faster...

302
00:24:38,977 --> 00:24:41,343
meaning she heals
almost instantly.

303
00:24:41,947 --> 00:24:44,575
The fossil record indicates these people
had conquered disease.

304
00:24:44,716 --> 00:24:47,913
We found no genetic disorders,
no viruses, no cancers.

305
00:24:48,019 --> 00:24:50,487
So what, they were just
naturally superior?

306
00:24:51,122 --> 00:24:52,612
No. Not naturally.

307
00:24:53,258 --> 00:24:56,193
See, the earliest remains
we found only had 23.

308
00:24:56,962 --> 00:24:59,726
We suspect this extra
chromosome may be synthetic.

309
00:25:00,098 --> 00:25:01,292
Bioengineered?

310
00:25:02,334 --> 00:25:04,302
That's a long word
for a Marine.

311
00:25:05,370 --> 00:25:06,462
Does it ever bother you...

312
00:25:06,571 --> 00:25:08,539
you could've spent your life
looking in a microscope...

313
00:25:08,673 --> 00:25:10,231
instead of a sniper scope?

314
00:25:12,911 --> 00:25:15,744
If they were so smart,
how come they're so dead?

315
00:25:16,882 --> 00:25:18,110
We don't know.

316
00:25:19,017 --> 00:25:21,110
Maybe they just went
with time.

317
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:24,550
You don't shield a baby
from time.

318
00:25:26,992 --> 00:25:28,653
We got movement up ahead.

319
00:25:30,095 --> 00:25:32,290
You stay here, okay?
Lock the door.

320
00:25:42,974 --> 00:25:45,033
Fucking door has
been ripped open.

321
00:25:45,510 --> 00:25:48,070
There's something
in Carmack's office.

322
00:26:43,068 --> 00:26:44,000
There!

323
00:26:46,471 --> 00:26:47,529
Contact!

324
00:26:47,672 --> 00:26:50,470
Moving east through
Carmack's office! Fast!

325
00:26:53,311 --> 00:26:56,474
Confirmed contact. Moving
fast, over south corridor.

326
00:26:57,182 --> 00:26:58,479
Hold your fire!

327
00:27:08,526 --> 00:27:11,393
If you have a weapon, drop it.

328
00:27:15,834 --> 00:27:16,892
Don't move.

329
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:31,843
Sam, I told you to stay...
But he knows me, John.

330
00:27:32,450 --> 00:27:35,044
Dr. Carmack, it's me.
Samantha.

331
00:27:35,754 --> 00:27:39,053
Where are the others?
Where are they?

332
00:27:39,157 --> 00:27:40,954
Steve, Hillary...

333
00:27:41,993 --> 00:27:43,654
I'm not gonna hurt you.

334
00:27:46,131 --> 00:27:47,792
I'm not gonna hurt you.

335
00:27:49,501 --> 00:27:50,661
Ah!

336
00:27:52,937 --> 00:27:54,029
Jesus Christ!

337
00:27:54,139 --> 00:27:56,437
Oh, damn.
Get a med kit.

338
00:27:56,541 --> 00:27:57,599
Nice.

339
00:27:58,076 --> 00:28:00,101
I'm not gonna hurt you.

340
00:28:00,245 --> 00:28:02,179
Duke, get him to the infirmary
with Dr. Grimm.

341
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:05,215
Portman, Kid, go to
the airlock and dig in.

342
00:28:05,950 --> 00:28:09,442
Anything trying to get away
from us will get driven straight to you.

343
00:28:12,257 --> 00:28:15,852
Now let's see if we can find the body
that goes with that arm.

344
00:28:19,931 --> 00:28:21,762
It's messed up, huh?

345
00:28:23,968 --> 00:28:25,401
Guy like Carmack...

346
00:28:26,104 --> 00:28:28,664
who's trained to put logic
before emotion...

347
00:28:29,374 --> 00:28:31,604
he's so freaked, huh...

348
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:34,076
he tears off his own ear?

349
00:28:35,413 --> 00:28:36,675
I tell you, man.

350
00:28:37,582 --> 00:28:40,881
It's shit like that
that gets under your skin.

351
00:28:48,793 --> 00:28:49,725
Do you...

352
00:28:54,632 --> 00:28:58,033
Do you have any?
Do I have any?

353
00:29:04,175 --> 00:29:05,107
What?

354
00:29:07,779 --> 00:29:08,711
You know.

355
00:29:10,648 --> 00:29:11,842
I'm just a little shook up.

356
00:29:11,950 --> 00:29:13,850
I need something
to get my focus, man.

357
00:29:13,952 --> 00:29:16,113
My game face.

358
00:30:18,750 --> 00:30:20,183
God damn it!

359
00:30:52,417 --> 00:30:54,214
I took His name in vain.

360
00:31:21,312 --> 00:31:23,280
Shit.

361
00:31:30,121 --> 00:31:32,919
There is a God.

362
00:31:55,980 --> 00:31:57,242
Ma'am.

363
00:31:58,516 --> 00:31:59,744
Excuse me, ma'am.

364
00:32:11,829 --> 00:32:13,262
Sarge...

365
00:32:14,499 --> 00:32:16,399
I think we found
the rest of that arm.

366
00:32:26,911 --> 00:32:28,970
No, no.

367
00:32:29,347 --> 00:32:32,680
No, no, I don't do nanowalls.
Yes, you do.

368
00:32:37,355 --> 00:32:40,051
You got him? Wait here.

369
00:32:41,826 --> 00:32:42,758
Shit.

370
00:33:00,845 --> 00:33:01,903
Two, three.

371
00:33:03,014 --> 00:33:03,946
You okay?

372
00:33:04,115 --> 00:33:05,980
Did they find the others?
Not yet.

373
00:33:06,084 --> 00:33:08,382
My husband is with them.

374
00:33:09,754 --> 00:33:11,483
I'm sure Steve's fine.

375
00:33:13,224 --> 00:33:16,057
Dr. Carmack, I'm going to
take your blood pressure.

376
00:33:20,932 --> 00:33:23,662
Hey...
It's okay, it's okay.

377
00:33:25,003 --> 00:33:27,335
I can feel it.
What happened in there?

378
00:33:28,506 --> 00:33:31,304
Shut it, shut it down.
Shut it down.

379
00:33:38,883 --> 00:33:40,180
S-Shut it down.

380
00:33:43,821 --> 00:33:44,913
It's inside.

381
00:33:47,025 --> 00:33:48,424
We heard something
in Genetics.

382
00:33:48,526 --> 00:33:49,584
We're re-entering.

383
00:33:49,727 --> 00:33:52,161
That's affirmative, Reaper.

384
00:33:57,635 --> 00:33:59,432
Looks like
we missed the party.

385
00:33:59,537 --> 00:34:01,232
We were just here.

386
00:34:03,274 --> 00:34:05,299
What happened
to all the animals?

387
00:34:28,299 --> 00:34:30,733
Sir, RRTS. We're here to help.

388
00:34:33,571 --> 00:34:35,300
Sir, are you okay?

389
00:34:36,841 --> 00:34:37,773
Okay.

390
00:34:41,012 --> 00:34:42,809
No, no, no. Sir, put it down.

391
00:34:47,351 --> 00:34:48,909
Contact report.

392
00:34:49,020 --> 00:34:49,952
Damn it.

393
00:34:50,688 --> 00:34:52,679
We found another
one of the scientists.

394
00:34:52,824 --> 00:34:54,792
Some weird shit
going on here, Sarge.

395
00:34:54,926 --> 00:34:58,327
Can you ID him?
We got a Dr. Olsen.

396
00:34:59,797 --> 00:35:02,732
He rushed us. Crazy.
Just like Carmack.

397
00:35:02,867 --> 00:35:05,062
Is he dead?
Yeah, very.

398
00:35:05,203 --> 00:35:07,603
Should we bag him and tag him?
Negative.

399
00:35:07,705 --> 00:35:09,730
Continue your search.

400
00:35:11,442 --> 00:35:12,374
Sarge?

401
00:36:10,568 --> 00:36:12,502
What was that?
A monkey.

402
00:36:16,374 --> 00:36:18,342
Some kind of monkey.

403
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:37,193
Oh, my God.

404
00:36:38,396 --> 00:36:40,660
There's something
in his blood.

405
00:36:43,334 --> 00:36:45,359
What's happening to him?

406
00:36:59,450 --> 00:37:02,442
Move, move, move.
I got him.

407
00:37:02,587 --> 00:37:04,680
Clear!
Go, go, go.

408
00:37:06,657 --> 00:37:09,490
Reaper, what have you got?
We're chasing something.

409
00:37:09,594 --> 00:37:12,722
What do you mean, something?
Something big, not human.

410
00:37:12,863 --> 00:37:13,795
God damn it!

411
00:37:13,898 --> 00:37:15,388
Give me a confirmation
on what you're seeing.

412
00:37:15,533 --> 00:37:17,398
Reaper.
It's in the sewer.

413
00:37:18,803 --> 00:37:20,236
All units, all units.

414
00:37:20,371 --> 00:37:22,305
Southeast corridor
near the med lab.

415
00:37:26,377 --> 00:37:27,810
And I thought
"being in the shit"

416
00:37:27,912 --> 00:37:29,072
was a figure of speech.

417
00:37:29,180 --> 00:37:31,614
Get in the goddamn hole,
Portman.

418
00:37:37,088 --> 00:37:39,420
I can handle things here.
You should go.

419
00:37:39,857 --> 00:37:43,293
I want to stay.
Steve is gonna be okay.

420
00:37:45,162 --> 00:37:47,892
The guys looking for him
are the best.

421
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,935
Go on, go on.
Be with your daughter.

422
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:53,294
Thank you.

423
00:38:01,879 --> 00:38:03,210
What's going on?

424
00:38:06,117 --> 00:38:09,052
"No blood match".
Can't be good, right?

425
00:38:10,721 --> 00:38:12,552
This is crazy.

426
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:17,025
Oh, my God!

427
00:38:24,168 --> 00:38:26,261
Tunnel ahead
is the main junction.

428
00:38:26,404 --> 00:38:28,304
It leads back
under the lab complex.

429
00:38:28,406 --> 00:38:30,840
Destroyer, cover the exit.

430
00:39:29,033 --> 00:39:30,466
We got a Dr. Willits.

431
00:39:31,068 --> 00:39:32,262
Steve Willits.

432
00:39:35,139 --> 00:39:36,231
Move out.

433
00:39:52,590 --> 00:39:54,353
"Be sober, be vigilant...

434
00:39:54,892 --> 00:39:56,792
"because your adversary,
the devil...

435
00:39:56,894 --> 00:39:59,419
"walketh about seeking
whom he may devour."

436
00:40:01,432 --> 00:40:03,195
That's real comforting, Goat.

437
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:05,393
That ain't
freaking me out at all.

438
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:11,071
Portman!
What the fuck?

439
00:40:12,042 --> 00:40:13,100
Go, go.

440
00:40:13,577 --> 00:40:15,670
Wait! Somebody's down there.
Come on.

441
00:40:16,514 --> 00:40:17,640
Grab an arm.

442
00:40:17,748 --> 00:40:19,010
Goddamn son of a bitch
is heavy!

443
00:40:19,116 --> 00:40:20,048
Hang on.

444
00:40:21,051 --> 00:40:22,609
Quick, he's slipping back.

445
00:40:22,953 --> 00:40:24,284
He's slipping.

446
00:40:26,424 --> 00:40:27,391
Shit.

447
00:40:27,525 --> 00:40:29,049
Portman,
what the hell happened?

448
00:40:29,193 --> 00:40:30,922
I fell in the damn hole.

449
00:40:31,061 --> 00:40:31,993
Shit.

450
00:40:32,129 --> 00:40:34,563
Everybody, on me.
Watch your goddamn footing.

451
00:40:34,665 --> 00:40:35,597
Move.

452
00:40:36,133 --> 00:40:37,065
Shit.

453
00:40:51,749 --> 00:40:53,410
Goat, straight ahead.
Sir.

454
00:40:53,784 --> 00:40:54,751
Portman, you're with me.

455
00:40:54,885 --> 00:40:57,149
John, take the Kid
and go to the right.

456
00:41:09,066 --> 00:41:09,998
Shit!

457
00:41:33,123 --> 00:41:34,454
You lost your folks, right?

458
00:41:34,558 --> 00:41:35,490
Shut up.

459
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:38,828
Small world. I mean,
I lost my parents, too.

460
00:41:40,664 --> 00:41:42,291
Yeah, I mean,
I woke up one morning...

461
00:41:42,399 --> 00:41:43,423
and everything was gone.

462
00:41:43,567 --> 00:41:45,057
I mean, the only thing left
was me.

463
00:41:45,202 --> 00:41:47,670
They wanted the TV
more than they wanted me.

464
00:41:49,106 --> 00:41:50,038
Ah!

465
00:41:51,141 --> 00:41:53,041
Every time
you open your mouth...

466
00:41:53,143 --> 00:41:54,701
you give away our position.

467
00:41:56,780 --> 00:41:57,974
Wait a minute.

468
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:05,179
Your pupils are dilated.

469
00:42:05,756 --> 00:42:07,451
Are you high?
What?

470
00:42:08,792 --> 00:42:11,124
No, I got this condition...
I don't give a damn.

471
00:42:11,262 --> 00:42:12,820
You take one more shot
of that shit...

472
00:42:12,930 --> 00:42:14,898
and I'll blow holes in you.
Are we clear?

473
00:42:15,165 --> 00:42:16,097
Okay.

474
00:42:25,009 --> 00:42:25,941
Get down.

475
00:42:26,076 --> 00:42:27,202
I'm sorry, look,
I just needed a little...

476
00:42:27,344 --> 00:42:28,368
Get down!

477
00:42:30,848 --> 00:42:33,612
Goat, I think there's
something coming up on you.

478
00:42:38,422 --> 00:42:39,889
This isn't happening.

479
00:42:41,559 --> 00:42:42,890
My light is down.

480
00:42:52,236 --> 00:42:53,294
I don't see anything.

481
00:42:53,437 --> 00:42:55,803
Don't move. I'm on my way.

482
00:42:57,308 --> 00:42:58,240
Pinky.

483
00:42:59,343 --> 00:43:00,810
Can you see anything?

484
00:43:03,047 --> 00:43:05,538
No. Nothing.

485
00:43:19,797 --> 00:43:20,889
Dr. Willits?

486
00:43:28,172 --> 00:43:29,161
Goat!

487
00:43:29,673 --> 00:43:31,334
Goat, what's your position?

488
00:43:31,475 --> 00:43:33,033
Goat, where are you?

489
00:43:33,978 --> 00:43:35,275
Goat, speak to me.

490
00:43:35,412 --> 00:43:37,437
God damn it, Reaper,
report to me.

491
00:43:39,016 --> 00:43:40,142
You're dead.

492
00:43:41,085 --> 00:43:42,313
Report contact.

493
00:44:05,843 --> 00:44:07,276
Man down.

494
00:44:08,145 --> 00:44:09,703
Man down!

495
00:44:11,482 --> 00:44:11,914
Everyone, get to the Ark now!

496
00:44:13,217 --> 00:44:14,741
Hunegs, report to
the quarantine zone.

497
00:44:14,885 --> 00:44:17,854
Evacuate the entire facility.
Get everyone to the Ark now.

498
00:44:17,988 --> 00:44:19,888
- What's going on?
- Get to the goddamn Ark.

499
00:44:19,990 --> 00:44:21,082
Let's go. Come on.

500
00:44:21,225 --> 00:44:23,284
We have an emergency. Come on.

501
00:44:23,427 --> 00:44:25,327
Everybody to the Ark.

502
00:44:30,334 --> 00:44:31,460
What happened?

503
00:44:31,602 --> 00:44:32,967
He was talking about devils.

504
00:44:33,070 --> 00:44:34,037
Devils?

505
00:44:34,171 --> 00:44:36,833
All his Bible shit.
Angels. Good and evil.

506
00:44:36,940 --> 00:44:38,874
Devils among us.
Let's get this vest off him.

507
00:44:38,976 --> 00:44:40,273
Now he's clear.

508
00:44:42,446 --> 00:44:43,378
Come on.

509
00:44:44,515 --> 00:44:45,539
Got a weak pulse.

510
00:44:45,683 --> 00:44:47,241
Portman,
get me a line in here.

511
00:44:48,318 --> 00:44:49,342
Come on, man.

512
00:44:49,486 --> 00:44:51,511
Kid, keep pressure
on that wound.

513
00:44:52,022 --> 00:44:54,047
How's the pulse?
I'm losing him.

514
00:44:55,359 --> 00:44:57,418
Sam, give me
a shot of adrenaline.

515
00:45:02,833 --> 00:45:04,733
We lost the pulse.
Okay, let's defib.

516
00:45:06,370 --> 00:45:07,462
Come on, man.

517
00:45:10,841 --> 00:45:11,773
Clear!

518
00:45:16,046 --> 00:45:17,741
Where the hell's Carmack?

519
00:45:18,215 --> 00:45:19,443
He disappeared.

520
00:45:19,583 --> 00:45:20,880
What do you mean,
he disappeared?

521
00:45:20,984 --> 00:45:22,679
He's gone. He disappeared.

522
00:45:23,220 --> 00:45:24,881
I've lost the pulse.
Shit.

523
00:45:24,988 --> 00:45:25,955
Okay.

524
00:45:26,090 --> 00:45:27,853
Gonna defib. Clear!

525
00:45:30,360 --> 00:45:32,123
- Come on.
- Come on.

526
00:45:33,063 --> 00:45:34,394
No response.
We're losing him.

527
00:45:34,531 --> 00:45:36,396
Sam, give me that adrenaline.

528
00:45:46,076 --> 00:45:47,441
Come on,
you son of a bitch.

529
00:45:47,544 --> 00:45:49,171
Okay, going again.
Clear!

530
00:46:12,202 --> 00:46:13,260
He's gone.

531
00:46:22,946 --> 00:46:24,641
Doctor,
you are going to tell me...

532
00:46:24,748 --> 00:46:26,545
just what the fuck
is going on up here.

533
00:46:26,650 --> 00:46:27,981
What?
Come here.

534
00:46:30,187 --> 00:46:31,211
Come here!

535
00:46:33,056 --> 00:46:34,318
This is "what."

536
00:46:36,727 --> 00:46:37,659
God.

537
00:46:38,362 --> 00:46:39,989
Have you
found anything like this...

538
00:46:40,097 --> 00:46:41,394
on your archeological digs?

539
00:46:41,532 --> 00:46:42,464
No.

540
00:46:42,599 --> 00:46:44,362
Is there any way this thing
came from the outside...

541
00:46:44,468 --> 00:46:45,400
from the surface?

542
00:46:45,536 --> 00:46:47,333
The planet is completely dead.

543
00:46:47,437 --> 00:46:49,302
It came from somewhere, lady.

544
00:46:49,540 --> 00:46:50,802
Portman, shut up!

545
00:46:50,941 --> 00:46:53,603
The atmosphere on the surface
can't support life.

546
00:46:53,744 --> 00:46:54,733
Maybe it doesn't need air.

547
00:46:54,878 --> 00:46:56,539
It could have come from
another planet or something.

548
00:46:56,647 --> 00:46:57,671
What? Like an alien?

549
00:46:57,815 --> 00:46:59,442
Look at that thing!
Portman!

550
00:46:59,550 --> 00:47:01,484
You need to shut the fuck up!

551
00:47:01,685 --> 00:47:03,209
That's not what we saw.

552
00:47:04,254 --> 00:47:06,950
That isn't what Goat and I
shot at in Genetics.

553
00:47:07,090 --> 00:47:09,752
You telling me there's more
of these fucking things?

554
00:47:09,860 --> 00:47:11,418
Where are
your surface entry points?

555
00:47:11,562 --> 00:47:14,395
There's a pressure door at
the end of the north corridor.

556
00:47:14,531 --> 00:47:16,192
Destroyer, Kid, Portman,
get there on the double.

557
00:47:16,300 --> 00:47:17,289
Give me an update.

558
00:47:17,434 --> 00:47:19,265
Yes, sir.
Whatever this thing is...

559
00:47:19,369 --> 00:47:21,394
it cannot get back
through the Ark.

560
00:47:21,538 --> 00:47:23,972
Mac, I want you to arm Pinky
with a weapon...

561
00:47:24,107 --> 00:47:27,167
with some ST grenades,
and seal the Ark door.

562
00:47:27,311 --> 00:47:28,403
There's one other door.

563
00:47:28,545 --> 00:47:29,569
Where?

564
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:32,581
The entrance
to the archeological dig.

565
00:47:33,250 --> 00:47:35,241
Ark portal activation
in progress.

566
00:47:35,419 --> 00:47:37,512
Don't let anything
through the Ark.

567
00:47:40,524 --> 00:47:43,425
Hey, wait. Wait a minute.
You can't leave me here.

568
00:47:43,527 --> 00:47:44,960
I'm not a soldier.

569
00:47:45,062 --> 00:47:46,461
Why don't you go
fuck yourself?

570
00:47:46,563 --> 00:47:47,530
It's bullshit.

571
00:47:47,664 --> 00:47:48,824
You're supposed to protect me.

572
00:47:48,966 --> 00:47:50,365
Ark secure.

573
00:47:50,467 --> 00:47:53,163
Remaining personnel,
ready for evacuation.

574
00:48:02,179 --> 00:48:03,544
Shit.

575
00:48:04,248 --> 00:48:05,340
Duke.

576
00:48:06,250 --> 00:48:07,410
Hold this open.

577
00:48:11,355 --> 00:48:12,652
Don't be a wuss.

578
00:48:31,642 --> 00:48:33,542
Little tension
between you and Reaper?

579
00:48:33,710 --> 00:48:36,110
We just went
our separate ways.

580
00:48:36,446 --> 00:48:39,938
Why does a talented student
throw it all away and join the RRTS?

581
00:48:41,018 --> 00:48:42,144
So, what was
he like before?

582
00:48:42,319 --> 00:48:43,980
Who, John?
Yeah.

583
00:48:44,087 --> 00:48:45,554
Empathetic, sensitive.

584
00:48:45,689 --> 00:48:47,850
It's kind of hard for me to
imagine Reaper as sensitive.

585
00:48:48,158 --> 00:48:52,094
I knew Reaper before all the
"drop down and give me 50, woo-ha"stuff.

586
00:48:53,230 --> 00:48:54,390
Yeah?

587
00:48:55,465 --> 00:48:57,365
Well, it's hua...
Hua.

588
00:48:57,467 --> 00:48:58,764
Yeah.

589
00:49:00,137 --> 00:49:01,764
Do you have a family?

590
00:49:02,406 --> 00:49:05,000
I have Destroyer.
You know, we grew up together.

591
00:49:06,276 --> 00:49:09,074
You know, Duke, I bet
secretly you have a big heart.

592
00:49:09,212 --> 00:49:10,372
Oh, yeah?

593
00:49:12,582 --> 00:49:14,982
And that's not the only
secret big thing I got.

594
00:49:16,186 --> 00:49:17,175
Little rusty, huh?

595
00:49:17,321 --> 00:49:19,983
Oh, lady,
you have no idea.

596
00:49:20,590 --> 00:49:23,923
Right now, having sex
with me is practically your civic duty.

597
00:49:28,098 --> 00:49:30,089
I need a power bone saw.

598
00:49:30,233 --> 00:49:32,167
A power bone saw?

599
00:49:32,636 --> 00:49:35,002
Girl, I've been waiting
on you my whole life.

600
00:49:36,606 --> 00:49:38,403
There's one
in the procedure room.

601
00:49:38,642 --> 00:49:41,577
Down the corridor,
on the left, through the nanowall.

602
00:49:42,179 --> 00:49:43,510
Through the nanowall?

603
00:49:45,816 --> 00:49:48,410
All right,
I got it. It's cool.

604
00:49:48,585 --> 00:49:50,849
For you I got it,
'cause you're pretty.

605
00:49:50,954 --> 00:49:51,921
Cool.

606
00:49:52,055 --> 00:49:53,283
I wouldn't do it for a dude,
you know.

607
00:49:53,423 --> 00:49:54,583
Off you go.

608
00:49:57,260 --> 00:49:59,319
We're going back in
through the airlock.

609
00:49:59,930 --> 00:50:01,693
We're not calling in backup?

610
00:50:03,500 --> 00:50:04,865
The Ark is sealed.

611
00:50:05,435 --> 00:50:06,459
Nothing gets back...

612
00:50:06,570 --> 00:50:08,538
until everything
on this planet is dead.

613
00:50:09,172 --> 00:50:10,605
We're going in hot.

614
00:50:11,341 --> 00:50:12,603
You're serious.

615
00:50:13,176 --> 00:50:14,609
Pick up your weapon, Portman.

616
00:50:14,745 --> 00:50:16,372
Come on, Portman, move out.

617
00:50:16,513 --> 00:50:18,743
Didn't y'all see
how that thing greased Goat?

618
00:50:19,583 --> 00:50:22,017
We don't know what
we're dealing with here.

619
00:50:23,220 --> 00:50:24,482
It's SOP to call in
reinforcements...

620
00:50:24,621 --> 00:50:25,553
when a situation...

621
00:50:25,655 --> 00:50:26,587
We are...

622
00:50:27,591 --> 00:50:29,024
the reinforcements.

623
00:50:36,299 --> 00:50:37,732
Now, you shoulder...

624
00:50:38,035 --> 00:50:39,935
your fucking weapon, soldier.

625
00:50:54,051 --> 00:50:56,611
All UAC personnel
evacuated to Earth.

626
00:51:18,308 --> 00:51:19,240
Duke?

627
00:51:43,800 --> 00:51:44,732
Duke?

628
00:51:47,337 --> 00:51:48,269
Duke!

629
00:51:50,841 --> 00:51:53,435
Hey, hey, hey.
It's just a power shortage.

630
00:51:53,810 --> 00:51:54,742
You okay?

631
00:51:56,480 --> 00:51:57,947
Here's your bone saw.

632
00:51:59,049 --> 00:52:00,311
So, which of you
is the oldest?

633
00:52:00,450 --> 00:52:01,439
What?

634
00:52:02,219 --> 00:52:04,187
Oh, me. By two minutes.

635
00:52:04,354 --> 00:52:05,582
Twins? Shit.

636
00:52:06,123 --> 00:52:07,454
Identical, right?

637
00:52:15,065 --> 00:52:16,794
Sam, get back in the lab.

638
00:52:39,856 --> 00:52:40,788
Shit.

639
00:52:45,328 --> 00:52:46,795
Motherfucker!

640
00:52:47,764 --> 00:52:48,753
Close it!

641
00:52:58,542 --> 00:53:00,669
And that's why
I don't do nanowalls.

642
00:53:02,245 --> 00:53:04,839
Pinky, we're entering
the archeological dig.

643
00:53:15,258 --> 00:53:16,452
Secure the exit.

644
00:54:10,814 --> 00:54:12,611
Sam. I'm coming.

645
00:54:14,417 --> 00:54:16,510
I'm hungry. Let's eat.

646
00:54:25,328 --> 00:54:27,694
Come on. Come on.

647
00:54:27,831 --> 00:54:30,493
- Careful now.
- Not too close, John.

648
00:54:32,569 --> 00:54:33,934
Go, go, go.

649
00:54:34,971 --> 00:54:36,233
Slow down.

650
00:54:36,840 --> 00:54:38,603
Go around. Go around again.

651
00:54:38,708 --> 00:54:40,869
No! Mommy!

652
00:54:49,052 --> 00:54:50,713
Is this where it happened?

653
00:54:53,456 --> 00:54:54,980
Did you find the door?

654
00:55:07,304 --> 00:55:08,236
John?

655
00:55:13,510 --> 00:55:14,442
Clay.

656
00:55:19,849 --> 00:55:20,781
Thurman.

657
00:55:23,086 --> 00:55:24,280
Look at them.

658
00:55:24,954 --> 00:55:27,923
They weren't trying to stop
something from getting in.

659
00:55:28,925 --> 00:55:31,223
Something stopped them
from getting out.

660
00:55:32,962 --> 00:55:33,986
Mac, stand by.

661
00:55:34,297 --> 00:55:35,229
Destroyer, report.

662
00:55:35,365 --> 00:55:36,832
We've reached
the north airlock.

663
00:55:36,966 --> 00:55:38,024
It's secure.

664
00:55:38,168 --> 00:55:41,194
Console indicates nothing's
come in or out for 26 hours.

665
00:55:45,275 --> 00:55:46,207
Mac?

666
00:55:47,610 --> 00:55:48,542
Mac.

667
00:55:49,713 --> 00:55:52,375
Mac, Mac, you copy?

668
00:55:55,285 --> 00:55:57,082
Talk to me. Talk to me, Mac.

669
00:55:59,589 --> 00:56:00,521
Shit.

670
00:56:02,859 --> 00:56:04,292
Jesus Christ.

671
00:56:11,434 --> 00:56:13,925
We're in pursuit.
Moving fast out of the dig.

672
00:56:14,104 --> 00:56:15,435
It's getting away.

673
00:56:15,672 --> 00:56:17,003
Pinky, what do you see?

674
00:56:17,140 --> 00:56:19,131
It's big. Very big.

675
00:56:19,576 --> 00:56:21,840
Moving fast,
back towards the lab complex.

676
00:56:25,048 --> 00:56:25,980
Clear.

677
00:56:27,951 --> 00:56:29,418
It's back in the lab.

678
00:56:33,857 --> 00:56:34,789
Clear!

679
00:56:35,992 --> 00:56:36,924
Clear.

680
00:56:37,861 --> 00:56:39,192
Damn, it's fast.

681
00:56:40,163 --> 00:56:41,460
All around defense, men.

682
00:56:41,564 --> 00:56:42,792
Did you get it?

683
00:56:44,534 --> 00:56:45,523
Pinky.
Yes, Sarge?

684
00:56:45,668 --> 00:56:46,794
Anything gets through
that door...

685
00:56:46,936 --> 00:56:47,868
use an ST grenade.

686
00:56:47,971 --> 00:56:49,734
It cannot get back to Earth.

687
00:56:51,474 --> 00:56:53,704
He pops an ST in there,
he's gonna blow the Ark.

688
00:56:53,843 --> 00:56:55,970
Reaper, Kid, pairs,
cover formation.

689
00:56:56,112 --> 00:56:57,739
Sweep the corridors. Go.

690
00:56:58,681 --> 00:57:01,343
Destroyer, you and Portman
stay here. Shut the airlock.

691
00:57:01,484 --> 00:57:02,610
Maintain a perimeter.

692
00:57:02,719 --> 00:57:03,811
He blows the Ark,
how the hell...

693
00:57:03,953 --> 00:57:05,352
are we supposed to
get the fuck home?

694
00:57:05,455 --> 00:57:07,480
Portman,
shut the fucking door.

695
00:57:07,824 --> 00:57:09,155
Where you going?

696
00:57:09,559 --> 00:57:10,992
I'm going to the armory.

697
00:57:11,761 --> 00:57:13,251
I think we're gonna
need something...

698
00:57:13,396 --> 00:57:14,886
with a little bit more kick.

699
00:57:44,794 --> 00:57:45,726
Jesus.

700
00:57:46,763 --> 00:57:48,731
You see
anything like it before?

701
00:58:02,979 --> 00:58:03,911
Heart.

702
00:58:11,955 --> 00:58:12,922
Liver.

703
00:58:24,100 --> 00:58:25,294
Kidneys.

704
00:58:25,535 --> 00:58:27,162
Dogs got kidneys, right?

705
00:58:27,537 --> 00:58:28,834
Pigs got kidneys.

706
00:58:37,814 --> 00:58:39,679
It's had its appendix removed.

707
00:58:40,450 --> 00:58:41,508
It's human.

708
00:58:42,452 --> 00:58:43,783
What the fuck?

709
00:59:27,063 --> 00:59:28,724
Goat knew he was turning.

710
00:59:36,539 --> 00:59:38,598
This thing
didn't butcher Willits.

711
00:59:42,045 --> 00:59:43,410
It is Willits.

712
00:59:44,113 --> 00:59:45,045
What?

713
00:59:51,988 --> 00:59:53,512
This is bullshit, man.

714
00:59:54,324 --> 00:59:55,655
I enlisted
to serve my country...

715
00:59:55,758 --> 00:59:57,692
not get greased protecting
some corporation's...

716
00:59:57,827 --> 00:59:59,192
goddamn science project.

717
01:00:02,532 --> 01:00:03,965
I gotta take a dump.

718
01:00:04,334 --> 01:00:05,892
What? Now?

719
01:00:06,736 --> 01:00:09,569
Unless you want me shitting
my pants right here.

720
01:00:15,545 --> 01:00:17,536
Please provide DNA
verification.

721
01:00:21,117 --> 01:00:23,881
Welcome, Patricia Tallman.
Access granted.

722
01:00:36,899 --> 01:00:39,629
Big fucking gun.

723
01:01:06,095 --> 01:01:07,289
Oh, shit.

724
01:02:07,190 --> 01:02:09,852
Portman, I got floor and wall
on your gun cam.

725
01:02:10,793 --> 01:02:12,761
I'm taking a shit,
you fucking gimp.

726
01:02:14,864 --> 01:02:16,991
Fuck you, Portman,
you piece of shit.

727
01:02:45,728 --> 01:02:46,922
Lost Portman on comm...

728
01:02:47,063 --> 01:02:48,997
and all I've got on Destroyer
is a wall.

729
01:02:49,098 --> 01:02:50,531
Portman, come in.

730
01:02:52,101 --> 01:02:53,159
Destroyer.

731
01:02:53,770 --> 01:02:54,702
Come in.

732
01:03:17,927 --> 01:03:19,360
This is Corporal
Dean Portman...

733
01:03:19,495 --> 01:03:23,090
with RRTS 6 Special Ops
on Olduvai, 0310 hours.

734
01:03:24,167 --> 01:03:26,294
We have encountered
hostile activity.

735
01:04:55,725 --> 01:04:59,923
I repeat, require immediate
RRTS reinforcements.

736
01:05:28,691 --> 01:05:31,922
Destroyer, Portman,
where the hell are you?

737
01:05:41,671 --> 01:05:42,933
Shit.

738
01:07:22,371 --> 01:07:23,303
Shit.

739
01:07:35,284 --> 01:07:37,377
Oh, God! Jesus!

740
01:07:37,787 --> 01:07:38,719
Hmm.

741
01:07:43,659 --> 01:07:45,524
- Pinky, you got Portman?
- No.

742
01:08:04,580 --> 01:08:06,013
Holy shit.

743
01:08:21,630 --> 01:08:22,654
He's gone.

744
01:08:28,471 --> 01:08:29,495
Destroyer?

745
01:08:29,839 --> 01:08:30,931
And Portman.

746
01:08:31,073 --> 01:08:32,370
What the fuck happened, man?

747
01:08:32,475 --> 01:08:33,942
I got him, I got him.

748
01:08:37,346 --> 01:08:38,813
Destroyer, I got you, man.

749
01:08:39,915 --> 01:08:41,143
What's up, man?

750
01:08:50,226 --> 01:08:51,625
What the hell is this?

751
01:08:51,760 --> 01:08:54,194
And whose goddamn blood
is on that window?

752
01:08:54,296 --> 01:08:55,228
Goat's.

753
01:08:56,966 --> 01:08:58,058
He killed himself.

754
01:08:58,200 --> 01:09:01,260
What do you mean, he killed himself?
He was already dead.

755
01:09:02,104 --> 01:09:04,095
It's true.
It's Goat.

756
01:09:04,607 --> 01:09:08,008
He was changing into one of these
motherfuckers and he killed himself.

757
01:09:08,144 --> 01:09:10,442
We found two more scientists
at the dig.

758
01:09:10,746 --> 01:09:12,441
Thurman and a balding guy
with glasses.

759
01:09:12,548 --> 01:09:13,810
Dr. Clay.

760
01:09:16,519 --> 01:09:18,043
Did you check their necks?

761
01:09:18,187 --> 01:09:19,882
Were there open wounds
on their necks?

762
01:09:19,989 --> 01:09:22,321
We were conducting
a firefight, not an autopsy.

763
01:09:22,424 --> 01:09:25,154
We came up here to find
six scientists.

764
01:09:25,294 --> 01:09:26,659
Four are known dead...

765
01:09:26,829 --> 01:09:30,162
and Dr. Willits is probably KIA
somewhere down in that sewer.

766
01:09:30,399 --> 01:09:32,390
The only one missing
is Dr. Carmack.

767
01:09:32,535 --> 01:09:34,560
Has Dr. Carmack showed up yet?

768
01:09:35,471 --> 01:09:37,098
Oh, he's shown up all right.

769
01:09:38,140 --> 01:09:39,607
Look at the left ear.

770
01:09:48,083 --> 01:09:49,414
Son of a bitch.

771
01:09:49,552 --> 01:09:51,520
I think this other one
is Steve Willits.

772
01:09:51,654 --> 01:09:54,384
I'm going to run the DNA,
check it against his med records.

773
01:09:54,523 --> 01:09:56,150
What are you people
working on up here?

774
01:09:56,258 --> 01:09:58,783
We're analyzing bones,
artifacts.

775
01:09:58,928 --> 01:10:00,589
We're not doing
anything like this.

776
01:10:00,729 --> 01:10:02,390
Then what the fuck is that?

777
01:10:02,531 --> 01:10:06,763
It must be a genetic mutation,
something environmental or viral.

778
01:10:07,069 --> 01:10:08,229
I don't know.

779
01:10:09,138 --> 01:10:10,799
It may even be reversible.

780
01:10:11,173 --> 01:10:12,197
It's irreversible.

781
01:10:12,341 --> 01:10:13,672
Not necessarily.

782
01:10:13,776 --> 01:10:15,403
Dr. Carmack's condition...

783
01:10:16,645 --> 01:10:18,010
is irreversible...

784
01:10:20,883 --> 01:10:22,009
No!

785
01:10:23,385 --> 01:10:25,580
Because Carmack's condition
is that...

786
01:10:26,822 --> 01:10:27,846
he's dead.

787
01:10:29,024 --> 01:10:30,924
Kid, you and Duke...

788
01:10:31,493 --> 01:10:34,553
get back to the dig and you make sure
those other dead scientists...

789
01:10:34,697 --> 01:10:35,994
are really dead.

790
01:10:42,738 --> 01:10:43,898
I've lost...

791
01:10:44,707 --> 01:10:46,174
four soldiers.

792
01:10:46,875 --> 01:10:51,244
What are you people
experimenting with up here?

793
01:10:54,183 --> 01:10:56,117
I'm not gonna ask you again.

794
01:10:57,219 --> 01:11:00,450
I told you, it's an archeological
research center.

795
01:11:01,957 --> 01:11:04,448
Do you think I'm lying to you?
Is that what you're saying?

796
01:11:08,530 --> 01:11:10,122
You think
I'm hiding something?

797
01:11:12,835 --> 01:11:14,359
I'm telling the truth.

798
01:11:19,908 --> 01:11:21,466
What were you downloading?

799
01:11:21,610 --> 01:11:23,510
What were you sent to protect?

800
01:11:25,581 --> 01:11:27,014
The research data.

801
01:11:28,751 --> 01:11:30,844
Research into what?

802
01:11:36,659 --> 01:11:40,186
Subject was injected
with study agent at 00:03.

803
01:11:42,364 --> 01:11:47,199
Vitals normal, elevated heart rate
attributable to subject anxiety.

804
01:11:48,404 --> 01:11:53,103
C- 24 successfully grafted to
subject's marker cells at 00:09.

805
01:11:53,242 --> 01:11:56,370
He reconstructed chromosome
mutation on a human subject.

806
01:11:57,613 --> 01:11:59,740
We were never gonna do
human studies.

807
01:12:00,616 --> 01:12:02,208
What the hell
are we looking at?

808
01:12:04,953 --> 01:12:07,444
Genesis, Chapter 1.

809
01:12:08,624 --> 01:12:12,560
Subject moved to protected
observation area at 00:17.

810
01:12:18,934 --> 01:12:21,494
Subject: Curtis Stahl.

811
01:12:22,404 --> 01:12:25,100
Crime: Multiple murder.

812
01:12:26,508 --> 01:12:29,375
Status:
Condemned to execution.

813
01:12:39,755 --> 01:12:41,279
Chromosome 24.

814
01:12:43,392 --> 01:12:44,324
Oh, my God.

815
01:12:44,593 --> 01:12:48,290
49 minutes after injection,
genetic mutations...

816
01:12:48,430 --> 01:12:52,093
began to visually manifest on
subject's extremities.

817
01:13:02,678 --> 01:13:04,839
This is what you're
here to protect.

818
01:13:05,381 --> 01:13:06,780
It doesn't make any sense.

819
01:13:06,882 --> 01:13:09,009
You trusted them.
They lied to you.

820
01:13:10,185 --> 01:13:11,584
They used you, Sam.

821
01:13:12,187 --> 01:13:14,178
If he perfected xenogenesis...

822
01:13:14,323 --> 01:13:16,450
Christ, don't you get it?

823
01:13:16,558 --> 01:13:19,083
It's this place. It's hell.
It always was.

824
01:13:22,898 --> 01:13:24,456
This shit ends here.

825
01:13:26,335 --> 01:13:27,632
What are you doing?

826
01:13:27,770 --> 01:13:29,465
We need to destroy
these discs.

827
01:13:29,605 --> 01:13:31,072
That's UAC property.

828
01:13:31,673 --> 01:13:34,073
Fuck UAC, we take this back,
they'll just...

829
01:13:34,443 --> 01:13:36,411
We take the data back.

830
01:13:38,447 --> 01:13:40,915
- Do you not see what's going on here?
- I didn't see shit.

831
01:13:42,184 --> 01:13:44,049
And I ain't paid to see shit.

832
01:13:44,386 --> 01:13:45,978
I have my orders.
And so do you.

833
01:13:48,724 --> 01:13:50,157
Is this everything?

834
01:13:51,493 --> 01:13:53,984
I said, is this everything?

835
01:13:54,463 --> 01:13:57,660
I, uh, have three more to download.
Then do it.

836
01:14:11,413 --> 01:14:12,345
Sarge?

837
01:14:13,415 --> 01:14:14,382
We got a problem.

838
01:14:14,516 --> 01:14:16,507
One dead scientist is missing.

839
01:14:17,419 --> 01:14:18,386
Now.

840
01:14:20,989 --> 01:14:22,889
You just wanna leave her here?

841
01:14:23,292 --> 01:14:24,816
She's got a job to do.

842
01:14:27,930 --> 01:14:32,162
Look, this is Portman's comm.
You call if you need help, okay?

843
01:14:35,170 --> 01:14:36,432
You gonna be all right?

844
01:14:38,640 --> 01:14:39,800
I'll be fine.

845
01:14:40,108 --> 01:14:41,939
Okay. I'll see you soon.

846
01:14:46,849 --> 01:14:48,373
Pinky, are you there? Pinky.

847
01:14:48,517 --> 01:14:52,078
Sarge? Something is cutting
through the Ark door.

848
01:14:52,254 --> 01:14:53,619
You have a visual?

849
01:14:54,356 --> 01:14:56,051
Oh, I got a visual all right.

850
01:14:56,291 --> 01:14:58,054
Don't let it get to the Ark!

851
01:14:58,694 --> 01:14:59,661
Five.

852
01:14:59,795 --> 01:15:01,319
Pinky, use the grenade!
Four.

853
01:15:01,530 --> 01:15:03,191
Use the goddamn grenade!
Three, two.

854
01:15:03,599 --> 01:15:05,066
Throw it!
One.

855
01:15:22,484 --> 01:15:24,611
Pinky's gone. That fucker ran.

856
01:15:24,753 --> 01:15:25,685
Shit.

857
01:15:25,988 --> 01:15:27,250
It got through.

858
01:15:27,823 --> 01:15:29,051
What the hell is that?

859
01:15:29,157 --> 01:15:30,454
System reboot.

860
01:15:30,559 --> 01:15:34,222
Time required to begin
renewed operation: Five minutes.

861
01:15:34,329 --> 01:15:35,853
Quarantine cordon is breached.

862
01:15:35,998 --> 01:15:37,932
This mission is
no longer containment.

863
01:15:38,033 --> 01:15:40,331
Get all the weapons and ammo
you can. We're going through.

864
01:15:40,469 --> 01:15:41,401
Move!

865
01:15:41,637 --> 01:15:43,070
Sam, come in. Over.

866
01:15:43,171 --> 01:15:45,264
Sam, do you read me? Over.
Come in!

867
01:15:46,742 --> 01:15:48,175
She's not answering.

868
01:15:48,610 --> 01:15:50,373
Time required to begin
renewed operation...

869
01:15:50,479 --> 01:15:52,845
four minutes and 45 seconds.

870
01:15:53,215 --> 01:15:54,409
You got three.

871
01:16:00,956 --> 01:16:03,151
Sam! Come in, Sam!

872
01:16:15,470 --> 01:16:16,437
Sam!

873
01:16:16,705 --> 01:16:18,696
Sam, why didn't you answer
your comm? We gotta go now!

874
01:16:18,840 --> 01:16:20,603
Why did they take Goat
and not Destroyer?

875
01:16:20,709 --> 01:16:22,677
Why Carmack
and not Dr. Thurman?

876
01:16:22,778 --> 01:16:24,712
What?
Lucy had the 24th chromosome...

877
01:16:24,846 --> 01:16:25,778
but she wasn't a monster.

878
01:16:25,914 --> 01:16:28,974
She died protecting her child,
not devouring it.

879
01:16:29,384 --> 01:16:31,750
Why did the same chromosome
that made her superhuman...

880
01:16:31,853 --> 01:16:33,650
turn Stahl into a monster?

881
01:16:33,789 --> 01:16:35,654
Let's go.
Just give me a minute.

882
01:16:35,791 --> 01:16:38,624
We don't have a minute.
Then give me 10 seconds.

883
01:16:41,430 --> 01:16:42,795
This is its tongue.

884
01:16:43,165 --> 01:16:45,599
This is brain matter
from Portman.

885
01:16:51,006 --> 01:16:52,598
This is from Destroyer.

886
01:17:00,349 --> 01:17:01,941
It's choosing, John.

887
01:17:02,751 --> 01:17:04,719
It's choosing who to infect.

888
01:17:05,520 --> 01:17:07,283
It's choosing?
How is it choosing?

889
01:17:07,389 --> 01:17:10,847
There are genetic markers
for psychotic and violent behavior.

890
01:17:11,727 --> 01:17:13,854
It could be a specific
neurotransmitter...

891
01:17:13,996 --> 01:17:16,055
it's picking up on,
a ganglion.

892
01:17:16,431 --> 01:17:18,661
Latching onto numbers
in the DNA code linked to...

893
01:17:18,800 --> 01:17:21,462
Linked to what? Evil?

894
01:17:21,703 --> 01:17:24,194
Ten percent of the human
genome is still unmapped.

895
01:17:24,339 --> 01:17:27,103
Some say it's the genetic
blueprint for the soul.

896
01:17:27,709 --> 01:17:30,701
Maybe C-24 is what destroyed
the population.

897
01:17:31,647 --> 01:17:33,808
It would explain why some of them
had to build the Ark...

898
01:17:33,949 --> 01:17:35,814
to escape to a new beginning.

899
01:17:36,451 --> 01:17:40,251
Some it made superhuman.
Others, monsters.

900
01:17:42,624 --> 01:17:43,716
Oh, my God.

901
01:17:44,426 --> 01:17:46,018
We gotta get out of here now.
What?

902
01:17:46,128 --> 01:17:48,096
Come on, let's go, come on.

903
01:17:48,430 --> 01:17:50,398
The people quarantined on
the other side of the Ark...

904
01:17:50,499 --> 01:17:51,830
they won't all be infected!

905
01:17:51,933 --> 01:17:53,264
What's going on?

906
01:17:54,369 --> 01:17:57,338
Sarge is going to
kill them all. Come on.

907
01:17:59,608 --> 01:18:03,169
We uphold quarantine. Nothing
gets to the elevator back on Earth.

908
01:18:03,311 --> 01:18:05,279
We can't let them
get to the surface.

909
01:18:05,414 --> 01:18:07,439
If it breathes, kill it.
Five...

910
01:18:07,616 --> 01:18:10,016
four, three...

911
01:18:10,485 --> 01:18:12,919
two, one.

912
01:18:20,429 --> 01:18:21,987
Ark travel complete.

913
01:18:24,299 --> 01:18:26,233
This is
Corporal Dean Portman...

914
01:18:26,334 --> 01:18:29,394
with RRTS 6 Special Ops
on Olduvai, 0310 hours.

915
01:18:30,539 --> 01:18:32,700
We have encountered
hostile activity.

916
01:18:33,375 --> 01:18:36,572
Require immediate
RRTS reinforcements.

917
01:18:36,978 --> 01:18:38,468
Yeah, no shit.

918
01:18:39,114 --> 01:18:42,208
We got 58 minutes before
the auto lockdown is lifted.

919
01:18:42,784 --> 01:18:44,718
Reset it
for another six hours.

920
01:18:44,853 --> 01:18:46,650
I can't. It's been disabled.

921
01:18:46,988 --> 01:18:48,853
Same as the topside comm link.

922
01:18:48,990 --> 01:18:50,480
They're disabling
computers now?

923
01:18:50,625 --> 01:18:52,752
Yeah, they're rocket scientists,
remember?

924
01:20:03,298 --> 01:20:05,323
Ark travel complete.

925
01:20:05,901 --> 01:20:06,925
Oh, my God.

926
01:20:09,504 --> 01:20:11,028
Sarge,
what's your position?

927
01:20:22,918 --> 01:20:23,850
Sarge.

928
01:20:24,019 --> 01:20:26,214
Sarge, come in.
Do you copy?

929
01:20:26,555 --> 01:20:28,750
Come in, Sarge.
Do you read me? Over.

930
01:20:28,857 --> 01:20:30,381
Sarge, come in,
do you copy?

931
01:20:30,759 --> 01:20:32,192
Loud and clear.

932
01:20:32,327 --> 01:20:33,692
Look, do not kill everybody.

933
01:20:33,829 --> 01:20:35,592
I repeat,
do not kill everybody.

934
01:20:35,730 --> 01:20:36,992
Help me.
They're not all infected.

935
01:20:37,098 --> 01:20:39,362
Help me, help me, please.
Do you copy?

936
01:20:39,801 --> 01:20:42,031
- Copy that.
- Help me.

937
01:20:49,144 --> 01:20:52,545
Clear the rest of this sector
and meet back at the Ark chamber.

938
01:21:13,768 --> 01:21:15,258
Jesus Christ,
what the hell are...

939
01:21:15,403 --> 01:21:16,802
Who the hell's in there?

940
01:21:18,373 --> 01:21:21,774
Well, don't just stand there,
you dumb son of a bitch. Help me up.

941
01:21:27,816 --> 01:21:28,748
It's okay.

942
01:21:39,327 --> 01:21:40,259
Please...

943
01:21:41,763 --> 01:21:42,923
help us.

944
01:21:46,201 --> 01:21:48,294
You don't have to
kill all of them.

945
01:21:48,603 --> 01:21:53,199
I don't think everyone is infected,
or even capable of being infected.

946
01:21:54,910 --> 01:21:58,141
We have orders to contain this threat
by any means necessary.

947
01:21:58,280 --> 01:22:00,680
So let's evacuate
the uninfected...

948
01:22:01,349 --> 01:22:02,714
and blow this place to hell.

949
01:22:02,817 --> 01:22:04,682
And we have orders
to protect this facility.

950
01:22:04,819 --> 01:22:06,946
We don't have orders
to kill innocent people.

951
01:22:10,325 --> 01:22:13,260
We have to stop anything
from getting to the surface...

952
01:22:13,728 --> 01:22:16,094
by any means...

953
01:22:16,731 --> 01:22:17,720
necessary.

954
01:22:19,267 --> 01:22:21,792
Found this little chicken shit
hiding under a pile of dead bodies.

955
01:22:21,937 --> 01:22:23,427
Am I glad to see you guys.

956
01:22:23,571 --> 01:22:25,664
That thing
cut right through the door.

957
01:22:25,807 --> 01:22:28,799
I tried to use the grenade
but it came at me too fast.

958
01:22:29,611 --> 01:22:32,774
Followed me through the Ark
and started to kill everybody.

959
01:22:33,515 --> 01:22:34,482
It was horrible.

960
01:22:34,616 --> 01:22:37,983
There's no wound on his neck.
He's clean.

961
01:22:40,789 --> 01:22:43,280
I say who's clean...

962
01:22:45,593 --> 01:22:46,992
and who's not.

963
01:22:47,329 --> 01:22:49,490
I mean, it wasn't my fault.

964
01:22:51,099 --> 01:22:53,260
Hey, I'm not a soldier.
You shouldn't have left me...

965
01:22:53,401 --> 01:22:54,333
Sarge.

966
01:22:57,238 --> 01:22:59,229
There's a storeroom
to the south.

967
01:22:59,374 --> 01:23:01,774
It's got, like, 20 people
holed up inside of it.

968
01:23:01,876 --> 01:23:03,400
We gotta do something.

969
01:23:04,646 --> 01:23:06,841
Your orders were
to clear that sector.

970
01:23:08,350 --> 01:23:09,544
Is it cleared?

971
01:23:10,218 --> 01:23:11,981
No, I told them to stay put.

972
01:23:13,021 --> 01:23:14,921
They're okay.
They're just scared shitless.

973
01:23:15,423 --> 01:23:16,549
We kill them all.

974
01:23:20,929 --> 01:23:22,487
Let God sort them out.

975
01:23:24,165 --> 01:23:25,359
This is wrong.

976
01:23:25,800 --> 01:23:27,893
I think...
Son, you don't think.

977
01:23:30,438 --> 01:23:31,803
That's an order.

978
01:23:33,708 --> 01:23:35,505
We're in the field, soldier.

979
01:23:35,710 --> 01:23:37,337
Sarge,
if nothing's found them...

980
01:23:37,479 --> 01:23:41,210
You will obey
the direct order...

981
01:23:43,151 --> 01:23:44,880
of your commanding officer.

982
01:23:53,028 --> 01:23:54,086
No.

983
01:23:57,098 --> 01:23:58,190
Now.

984
01:24:00,368 --> 01:24:01,426
Go to hell.

985
01:24:02,070 --> 01:24:03,332
No!

986
01:24:04,139 --> 01:24:05,629
No.
Holy shit.

987
01:24:16,117 --> 01:24:19,678
Mutinous insurrection
is punishable...

988
01:24:21,289 --> 01:24:22,221
by death.

989
01:24:26,795 --> 01:24:29,923
It was his first mission!
And it's not gonna be my last.

990
01:24:30,365 --> 01:24:31,764
I need soldiers.

991
01:24:32,600 --> 01:24:35,068
I don't need anybody else
but soldiers.

992
01:25:10,438 --> 01:25:11,803
Drop the weapons.

993
01:25:12,273 --> 01:25:13,297
I mean it.

994
01:25:13,775 --> 01:25:17,370
I have no intention of being killed.
Drop the weapons.

995
01:25:23,017 --> 01:25:24,314
Ah, there's something
behind me, isn't there?

996
01:25:38,299 --> 01:25:39,231
On me.

997
01:25:43,538 --> 01:25:44,470
Get Sam.

998
01:26:02,190 --> 01:26:03,214
Wait here.

999
01:26:16,604 --> 01:26:17,536
Listen.

1000
01:26:26,114 --> 01:26:28,981
Withdraw!
Withdraw behind the nanowall.

1001
01:26:29,551 --> 01:26:32,452
Move!
I can't see. I can't see.

1002
01:26:45,200 --> 01:26:46,132
Move.

1003
01:26:52,607 --> 01:26:53,869
Clear!

1004
01:26:58,146 --> 01:27:00,171
Fuck! The wall's not closing!

1005
01:27:26,307 --> 01:27:28,241
I'm not supposed to die.

1006
01:27:30,678 --> 01:27:31,645
Let's go.

1007
01:27:35,416 --> 01:27:37,281
Come on.

1008
01:27:39,420 --> 01:27:40,352
Clear.

1009
01:27:43,825 --> 01:27:45,850
How long
before they get through?

1010
01:27:47,528 --> 01:27:48,460
Not long.

1011
01:27:50,231 --> 01:27:51,698
You've been hit.

1012
01:27:52,267 --> 01:27:53,461
Oh, John.

1013
01:28:08,983 --> 01:28:10,507
Listen to me, Sam.

1014
01:28:11,953 --> 01:28:14,751
You're cold. Shivering.

1015
01:28:16,591 --> 01:28:17,819
It's important.

1016
01:28:18,526 --> 01:28:20,391
This is an ST grenade.

1017
01:28:22,230 --> 01:28:23,891
When they come through...

1018
01:28:25,533 --> 01:28:27,626
you pop the top
and hit the button.

1019
01:28:31,539 --> 01:28:33,973
John, stay with me.
Stay awake.

1020
01:28:34,809 --> 01:28:37,277
John, stay with me, please.

1021
01:28:43,685 --> 01:28:44,777
What's that?

1022
01:28:45,620 --> 01:28:48,919
It's C-24. It's from Carmack's lab.
No.

1023
01:28:49,157 --> 01:28:51,853
It could save you.
No way, forget it.

1024
01:28:52,527 --> 01:28:54,188
You're bleeding to death.

1025
01:28:55,229 --> 01:28:57,459
No way, Sam.

1026
01:29:00,268 --> 01:29:01,929
I've done some bad things.

1027
01:29:06,441 --> 01:29:07,703
I know you.

1028
01:29:08,976 --> 01:29:10,273
You don't know me.

1029
01:29:12,480 --> 01:29:13,708
You don't know.

1030
01:29:14,549 --> 01:29:17,677
You're my brother.
I know you.

1031
01:29:22,056 --> 01:29:22,988
Wait.

1032
01:29:24,959 --> 01:29:25,926
Wait.

1033
01:29:27,228 --> 01:29:30,197
If I should turn into
one of those demons.

1034
01:29:33,101 --> 01:29:35,194
One through the heart,
one through the head...

1035
01:29:35,336 --> 01:29:36,928
don't you hesitate. Okay?

1036
01:29:37,138 --> 01:29:38,503
I won't need to.

1037
01:29:57,925 --> 01:29:59,415
I know you.

1038
01:30:00,194 --> 01:30:02,094
You're my brother.

1039
01:30:10,238 --> 01:30:11,262
Sam?

1040
01:31:59,981 --> 01:32:01,039
Sam.

1041
01:32:27,909 --> 01:32:28,876
Sam.

1042
01:33:32,273 --> 01:33:33,240
Sam.

1043
01:33:44,986 --> 01:33:45,918
John.

1044
01:34:54,188 --> 01:34:55,155
Sam.

1045
01:34:59,927 --> 01:35:00,859
Sam.

1046
01:35:32,493 --> 01:35:35,621
Sam.
You're alive.

1047
01:35:36,330 --> 01:35:37,388
Shh. Don't talk.

1048
01:35:38,165 --> 01:35:40,827
Last man standing, Reaper.

1049
01:35:46,874 --> 01:35:48,671
I think she needs
medical attention.

1050
01:35:54,348 --> 01:35:57,215
Can you get to the elevator?
I'm not sure.

1051
01:35:59,253 --> 01:36:00,277
Try.

1052
01:36:06,026 --> 01:36:08,153
Where are the survivors
Kid found?

1053
01:36:09,730 --> 01:36:11,493
I took care of that problem.

1054
01:36:13,334 --> 01:36:17,134
Quarantine's almost over.
Power should be back on any minute.

1055
01:36:21,976 --> 01:36:26,504
You killed the Kid.
We're all killers, Reaper.

1056
01:36:28,916 --> 01:36:30,349
It's what they pay us for.

1057
01:36:31,418 --> 01:36:34,819
Quarantine complete.
Elevators back on line.

1058
01:36:46,567 --> 01:36:47,761
It's finished.

1059
01:36:49,670 --> 01:36:52,798
What do you say we go outside
and get some fresh air?

1060
01:37:01,048 --> 01:37:05,041
Are you gonna shoot me?
Yeah, I was thinking about it.

1061
01:37:05,886 --> 01:37:08,878
What you got left?
Half a clip. You?

1062
01:37:19,867 --> 01:37:21,801
I've got one round.

1063
01:39:59,326 --> 01:40:01,521
Semper fi, motherfucker.

1064
01:40:03,998 --> 01:40:06,466
Faithful to the Corps, John.

1065
01:42:54,668 --> 01:42:55,828
Ugh.

1066
01:42:57,204 --> 01:42:59,604
Ark portal activation
in progress.

1067
01:43:12,419 --> 01:43:13,351
Five...

1068
01:43:13,754 --> 01:43:16,348
four, three...

1069
01:43:16,523 --> 01:43:18,718
two, one.

1070
01:43:32,539 --> 01:43:34,006
Like the Kid said:

1071
01:43:36,343 --> 01:43:37,401
"Go to hell".

1072
01:44:11,945 --> 01:44:13,242
Almost home.
