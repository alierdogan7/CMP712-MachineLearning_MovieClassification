1
00:00:39,447 --> 00:00:42,020
Fat Dog, you've finally appeared

2
00:00:42,022 --> 00:00:44,626
If I don't catch you today,
I can't report back to base

3
00:00:55,004 --> 00:00:58,184
After being in the force for this long,
have I ever arrested the wrong person ?

4
00:00:58,186 --> 00:01:01,239
I'll leave that question for the judge

5
00:01:01,241 --> 00:01:04,419
My philosophy is that...

6
00:01:05,236 --> 00:01:06,994
Cops catch felons

7
00:01:53,955 --> 00:01:57,777
Before the 1997 Handover

8
00:02:13,412 --> 00:02:14,138
4 fives

9
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:15,103
Open

10
00:02:15,105 --> 00:02:17,485
- Drink !
- This time doesn't count

11
00:02:17,487 --> 00:02:20,030
Come, again... this bottle

12
00:02:20,264 --> 00:02:21,120
7 sixes

13
00:02:21,122 --> 00:02:22,590
You lost again
- Do you know how to play ?

14
00:02:22,592 --> 00:02:24,229
Waiter, give her the rule book

15
00:02:51,759 --> 00:02:53,265
Let me introduce you.
My younger brother, 'Tiger'

16
00:02:53,267 --> 00:02:54,486
Brother Shan

17
00:02:54,925 --> 00:02:56,928
- Hello, Brother Shan
- Hello

18
00:02:56,930 --> 00:02:58,910
You're sweating a lot

19
00:03:04,368 --> 00:03:06,714
That's my adopted brother... Zha

20
00:03:12,577 --> 00:03:16,013
I have a lot of stuff to move.
There are many smugglers who can do it

21
00:03:16,015 --> 00:03:18,314
- You want to a contract deal
- If you want to do Vietnam...

22
00:03:18,316 --> 00:03:20,578
If must be us 3 brothers

23
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:23,650
Who would know the place better than us ?
We are Vietnamese

24
00:03:23,652 --> 00:03:25,711
However you want to split it,
we'll go along with it

25
00:03:25,713 --> 00:03:27,221
That's all there is to it

26
00:03:33,991 --> 00:03:35,615
I lost again

27
00:03:35,617 --> 00:03:37,973
It doesn't count.  Again, again

28
00:03:39,475 --> 00:03:41,675
- 4 ones, I don't care.
- 4 ones ?

29
00:03:41,677 --> 00:03:43,185
Is that right ?

30
00:03:43,187 --> 00:03:45,345
Just because you don't think so

31
00:03:49,325 --> 00:03:51,343
Police checking ID.
Move in

32
00:03:53,059 --> 00:03:54,567
Check ID

33
00:03:57,072 --> 00:03:59,547
You.  Get out here

34
00:04:05,166 --> 00:04:08,830
I threw that bottle

35
00:04:09,914 --> 00:04:11,585
So what ?

36
00:04:12,237 --> 00:04:14,490
My apologies

37
00:04:33,109 --> 00:04:36,890
Flashpoint

38
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:39,393
1996, January 2nd

39
00:04:39,395 --> 00:04:43,499
Mongkok, Stanley St, whilst checking ID,
you assaulted a person

40
00:04:43,501 --> 00:04:47,123
And broke the criminal's pelvis in 3 places

41
00:04:47,125 --> 00:04:48,761
He spent 2 months in hospital.
How do you plead ?

42
00:04:51,041 --> 00:04:52,806
1997, February 17th

43
00:04:52,808 --> 00:04:56,757
Yaumatei, Miu St, Triad activity.
You assaulted another person

44
00:04:56,759 --> 00:04:59,163
The criminal sustained serious head injury

45
00:04:59,165 --> 00:05:02,126
According to the doctor,
has permanently lost his sense of taste

46
00:05:02,128 --> 00:05:04,180
How do you plead ?

47
00:05:05,268 --> 00:05:08,251
- 1996...
- That’s enough

48
00:05:08,253 --> 00:05:08,894
I'm guilty

49
00:05:08,896 --> 00:05:12,157
In the first half of this year,
on average you have been involved
in 14 cases per month

50
00:05:12,159 --> 00:05:15,224
In each case, you have injured,
on average, 2.8 people

51
00:05:15,728 --> 00:05:18,526
Half a year.  You have already broken
your record from last year

52
00:05:18,528 --> 00:05:20,690
What's the problem with police
apprehending criminals ?

53
00:05:20,692 --> 00:05:22,462
The person making the complaint is me

54
00:05:22,464 --> 00:05:25,321
Are we here to arrest criminals, or police ?

55
00:05:25,323 --> 00:05:28,941
Inspector Ma,
I know that you are an outstanding officer

56
00:05:28,943 --> 00:05:31,531
You have the highest number of solved cases

57
00:05:31,533 --> 00:05:32,771
But I want to remind you...

58
00:05:32,773 --> 00:05:36,082
You need to pay attention to your
attitude and the way you operate

59
00:05:36,084 --> 00:05:37,785
I don't think there is a problem

60
00:05:38,637 --> 00:05:40,737
OK, you can leave

61
00:05:44,514 --> 00:05:45,887
I've timed it

62
00:05:45,889 --> 00:05:48,714
From when I came in,
you've talked for 1 hour

63
00:05:48,716 --> 00:05:51,398
Who knows, perhaps in an hour,
I could have solved a case

64
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:54,077
Do you think you need
to reconsider you operating standards

65
00:05:54,079 --> 00:05:56,384
Don't waste everyone's time

66
00:06:05,407 --> 00:06:06,971
Good

67
00:06:06,973 --> 00:06:09,564
That's $50k.
You want to bet with me ?

68
00:06:09,566 --> 00:06:12,023
Betting so big with me,
you'll lose everything

69
00:06:15,345 --> 00:06:18,740
Tiger... that's not how you play golf

70
00:06:18,742 --> 00:06:21,305
It's not martial arts,
where you use that stance

71
00:06:21,307 --> 00:06:22,421
Here, I'll teach you

72
00:06:22,423 --> 00:06:25,127
It’s simple.
You hold the club

73
00:06:25,129 --> 00:06:28,335
Most important is that
your thigh and shoulder is level

74
00:06:28,337 --> 00:06:31,923
Look where you're aiming,
then look at the ball

75
00:06:31,925 --> 00:06:34,102
Then swing through hard

76
00:06:39,045 --> 00:06:41,160
That's what you shouldn't do

77
00:06:45,924 --> 00:06:48,168
Again, again

78
00:06:48,318 --> 00:06:50,746
Brother Zha. something's not right

79
00:06:58,325 --> 00:07:00,140
Hold on

80
00:07:00,354 --> 00:07:02,477
These friends don't know anything

81
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:04,531
You leave first

82
00:07:08,766 --> 00:07:10,662
I asked you to move the stuff to Vietnam.

83
00:07:10,664 --> 00:07:12,777
But if you're not blaming it on tornados,
then it’s because of storms

84
00:07:12,779 --> 00:07:16,256
It’s been 2 months, friend.
You trying to send it to the moon ?

85
00:07:16,258 --> 00:07:18,335
- You screwing with me ?
- Friend...

86
00:07:18,337 --> 00:07:20,381
Big winds and big waves are inevitable

87
00:07:20,383 --> 00:07:22,526
How about you ?

88
00:07:22,528 --> 00:07:24,370
The blame will be on you if the ship sinks

89
00:07:25,266 --> 00:07:28,414
The shipment was worth $80 Mil.
You've only paid back $2k

90
00:07:29,332 --> 00:07:31,760
You should have told me earlier,
I would have sent it by courier

91
00:07:31,762 --> 00:07:33,297
It’s just a few days by plane

92
00:07:33,299 --> 00:07:35,602
If your shipping it by sea,
of course it will take a few months

93
00:07:35,604 --> 00:07:37,424
Go home and wait

94
00:07:37,681 --> 00:07:38,916
What did you say ?

95
00:07:41,623 --> 00:07:43,250
Don't be stupid now

96
00:07:43,252 --> 00:07:45,916
Otherwise, I'll kill you

97
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:49,550
You trying to scare me ?
Which one are you ?

98
00:07:49,642 --> 00:07:52,479
Your boss won't come out,
and leaves you flunkies here instead

99
00:07:52,481 --> 00:07:54,473
Get Tony out here !

100
00:07:56,744 --> 00:07:57,794
Mother fucker

101
00:08:16,528 --> 00:08:18,990
This is how we work

102
00:08:33,267 --> 00:08:36,381
Don't do that in public

103
00:08:37,928 --> 00:08:39,379
Put on some suntan lotion

104
00:08:43,181 --> 00:08:45,659
Don't be like that. Is this revenge ?

105
00:08:45,661 --> 00:08:49,262
Wait for me.  You two are always bickering

106
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:50,853
Tan

107
00:08:50,855 --> 00:08:52,605
Don't let him play cool all the time

108
00:08:52,607 --> 00:08:54,087
If you're going to arrest someone,
then just arrest them

109
00:08:54,089 --> 00:08:57,151
You're always bashing people up.
Yeah, we know you can fight

110
00:08:57,897 --> 00:09:01,599
Every time something happens
you come looking for me. Each time you come
looking for me, you want me to save you

111
00:09:01,601 --> 00:09:04,085
And if something bad happens,
you put it on me.
What do you want me to do ?

112
00:09:04,087 --> 00:09:05,667
What are you still complaining about,
muscle man ?

113
00:09:05,669 --> 00:09:07,133
Taking off your clothes all day,
showing your arse

114
00:09:07,135 --> 00:09:10,641
Last time you injured my arm, the doctor
said that there would be complications

115
00:09:10,882 --> 00:09:12,960
You threw a whole bottle of wine in my face

116
00:09:12,962 --> 00:09:15,005
If I didn't do something,
everyone would be suspicious

117
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:16,480
You fought back, remember

118
00:09:16,482 --> 00:09:18,963
You hit me, of course I would retaliate.
You want me to lose my street cred ?

119
00:09:18,965 --> 00:09:20,597
Street cred ? ! You're a cop ! Street cred.

120
00:09:20,599 --> 00:09:22,740
Why don't you scream it out louder, idiot

121
00:09:22,742 --> 00:09:26,034
We're all on the same side here,
you shouldn't have been so heavy handed

122
00:09:26,036 --> 00:09:28,363
And you.
You know that he is a loose cannon,
and you still go light a fire under him

123
00:09:28,365 --> 00:09:29,666
Who else would do that ?

124
00:09:29,668 --> 00:09:31,626
When you got me into this,
you made it sound good

125
00:09:31,628 --> 00:09:33,591
[ ?]

126
00:09:33,593 --> 00:09:35,890
How long do I need to stay undercover ?

127
00:09:35,892 --> 00:09:38,770
Don't talk about the past.
Let's talk about the facts

128
00:09:38,772 --> 00:09:40,698
Who is your superior here ?

129
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:41,968
Oh, this again

130
00:09:41,970 --> 00:09:44,418
What ?
There's such thing as a chain of command

131
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:47,498
Stop arguing.  The two of you will probably
never work together again anyway

132
00:09:47,711 --> 00:09:49,190
Really ?

133
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:50,733
The Complaints department report is out

134
00:09:50,735 --> 00:09:53,301
You remain team leader, but next month
you report to the music department

135
00:09:53,303 --> 00:09:55,399
No need to be that harsh

136
00:09:55,401 --> 00:09:57,851
You said it yourself.
There's a chain of command

137
00:09:58,503 --> 00:09:59,967
I want to appeal

138
00:10:10,414 --> 00:10:12,324
Keep at it.  It's up to you now

139
00:10:12,326 --> 00:10:14,677
Same to you

140
00:10:14,807 --> 00:10:17,865
Try not to be so picky.
Do whatever you want to do

141
00:10:18,243 --> 00:10:19,673
If I die, then I die

142
00:10:19,675 --> 00:10:22,522
I've lived my fill

143
00:10:59,568 --> 00:11:01,137
What sort of playing is that ?

144
00:11:01,139 --> 00:11:02,738
Wrong four times out of four

145
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:04,170
When was I wrong ?

146
00:11:04,172 --> 00:11:06,649
12th section,
after the 6th note, the E sharp

147
00:11:06,651 --> 00:11:09,743
We didn't hear anything wrong,
except for your shouting

148
00:11:10,244 --> 00:11:12,031
As officers, we should take things seriously

149
00:11:12,033 --> 00:11:14,705
You think we are mucking around ?
If you want to do that, leave

150
00:11:14,707 --> 00:11:16,844
Not everyone does things your way,
Inspector Ma

151
00:11:16,846 --> 00:11:19,239
- You...
- You must have been wrong

152
00:11:19,241 --> 00:11:20,953
If an officer makes a mistake

153
00:11:20,955 --> 00:11:24,460
They will ruin someone else’s life,
or their own

154
00:11:24,462 --> 00:11:27,210
Take it seriously, and improve your work

155
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:28,583
What are you doing here, mum ?

156
00:11:28,585 --> 00:11:31,465
I knew that you were here,
and wanted to let you know...

157
00:11:31,467 --> 00:11:33,360
I'm going back to the country

158
00:11:33,827 --> 00:11:35,682
Wait till I have a bit of free time,
and I'll take you back

159
00:11:35,684 --> 00:11:37,938
I've already waited

160
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:40,668
Waited until Auntie ChangZhou is dead

161
00:11:40,775 --> 00:11:42,786
I'll go back to pay my respects

162
00:11:42,788 --> 00:11:46,387
If I like it there, I won't come back

163
00:11:46,389 --> 00:11:47,571
Don't be like that, mum.

164
00:11:47,573 --> 00:11:50,184
I'm very lonely here by myself

165
00:11:50,186 --> 00:11:54,447
You worry all day, and have no time for me

166
00:11:55,214 --> 00:11:59,077
Take care.  You shouldn't risk
so much going after crooks

167
00:11:59,079 --> 00:12:03,034
What's the most important thing ?
It's preserving your own life

168
00:12:03,036 --> 00:12:05,974
Without your life, how can you be a person

169
00:12:07,383 --> 00:12:10,199
Take care. I'm leaving now

170
00:12:38,286 --> 00:12:40,445
Everyone's just after a living

171
00:12:40,447 --> 00:12:42,265
You took Shan's stuff

172
00:12:42,267 --> 00:12:45,008
He called you out to negotiate,
and you turn it to a fight

173
00:12:45,010 --> 00:12:48,711
And now you ask us to ignore it.  Why ?

174
00:12:49,031 --> 00:12:50,915
Shan will disappear

175
00:12:50,917 --> 00:12:54,442
If in the end, it is found
that you are involved, it won’t be good

176
00:12:54,444 --> 00:12:57,081
If you leave it alone, nothing will happen

177
00:12:57,285 --> 00:13:00,480
If it wasn't for the 3 of you,
nothing would have happened

178
00:13:00,482 --> 00:13:02,891
Its better if you don't mess up our place

179
00:13:02,893 --> 00:13:05,139
If we didn't take you in...

180
00:13:05,141 --> 00:13:07,564
You'd still be floating in the sea

181
00:13:09,556 --> 00:13:12,372
Our family was stuck in a refugee camp

182
00:13:12,374 --> 00:13:14,304
It wasn't much different to living in prison

183
00:13:14,306 --> 00:13:16,321
Why did we riot ?

184
00:13:16,323 --> 00:13:19,020
Because we wanted a place of our own

185
00:13:19,987 --> 00:13:23,345
If there are those that don't want us around

186
00:13:23,347 --> 00:13:25,997
Then we go to war

187
00:13:34,706 --> 00:13:35,628
Boss

188
00:13:35,630 --> 00:13:37,820
How is it ?  All done ?

189
00:13:37,822 --> 00:13:39,231
No good ?

190
00:13:39,233 --> 00:13:40,554
No yet

191
00:13:40,556 --> 00:13:42,990
It's not that the talks have broken down,
but they haven't started yet

192
00:13:42,992 --> 00:13:46,787
Don't do anything for now,
otherwise there'd  be nothing to discuss

193
00:13:47,996 --> 00:13:50,131
Don't be unreasonable now.

194
00:13:51,479 --> 00:13:53,607
That's it.  Just do it

195
00:13:53,609 --> 00:13:54,707
Wait...

196
00:13:54,709 --> 00:13:57,207
You talk to them

197
00:13:59,503 --> 00:14:02,488
Four eyes,
your wife takes your kid to school so early

198
00:14:02,490 --> 00:14:03,766
It'd be unfortunate if they died

199
00:14:03,768 --> 00:14:04,616
Are you threatening me ?

200
00:14:04,618 --> 00:14:07,894
Of course I'm threatening you,
otherwise I wouldn't be shouting
you breakfast [ ? ?]

201
00:14:09,267 --> 00:14:11,234
I also don't want
to hurt everyone’s feelings

202
00:14:11,236 --> 00:14:15,454
If we can work this one out,
there will be a lot more opportunities
for us in the future

203
00:14:19,488 --> 00:14:21,699
The four eyed woman in red...

204
00:14:21,701 --> 00:14:25,228
taking her dopey four eyed kid

205
00:14:25,337 --> 00:14:28,804
When I tell you to run over them,
I want you to floor the gas

206
00:14:28,806 --> 00:14:30,085
OK

207
00:14:31,030 --> 00:14:33,242
Quickly, have you thought it over ?

208
00:14:33,386 --> 00:14:36,815
Your 4 eyed kid is
about to reach the entrance

209
00:14:39,827 --> 00:14:42,778
I can't hear anyone answering me

210
00:14:46,027 --> 00:14:47,858
We will ignore the situation with Shan

211
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:50,911
That's too quiet,
he won't be able to hear you

212
00:14:55,982 --> 00:14:57,799
We will ignore the situation with Shan

213
00:14:58,532 --> 00:15:01,517
Don't be careless now, y'hear

214
00:15:03,301 --> 00:15:06,034
Zha, this is Da Xia

215
00:15:06,036 --> 00:15:09,272
Let's go out for drinks when you're free,
we're all friends here

216
00:15:09,274 --> 00:15:11,893
You should have said from the start

217
00:15:19,332 --> 00:15:20,812
Have breakfast

218
00:15:20,814 --> 00:15:24,406
I've spent the money to buy it...
are you not giving me any face ?

219
00:15:26,955 --> 00:15:29,160
Run over them

220
00:15:29,498 --> 00:15:30,442
OK

221
00:15:35,876 --> 00:15:37,036
Turn

222
00:15:41,836 --> 00:15:43,804
Are you a dog ? So obedient

223
00:15:43,806 --> 00:15:46,292
Just because I said it, you'd do it ?
You could have killed someone

224
00:15:46,294 --> 00:15:48,164
How can you be so dumb ?

225
00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:53,976
Hey, it's my shout for your birthday tonight

226
00:15:54,793 --> 00:15:56,730
I going to meet some friends

227
00:15:56,732 --> 00:15:59,122
What ? You have friends ?

228
00:15:59,448 --> 00:16:01,178
- Yes
- OK

229
00:16:03,325 --> 00:16:05,788
Here, have fun

230
00:16:05,790 --> 00:16:06,960
Thank you, Boss

231
00:16:28,673 --> 00:16:30,511
Lily ?

232
00:16:31,057 --> 00:16:34,351
It's me.
Are you free ?  Come over

233
00:16:35,601 --> 00:16:37,364
What are you saying ?

234
00:16:37,366 --> 00:16:38,990
Why are you shouting
at me out of the sudden ?

235
00:16:39,626 --> 00:16:42,572
Hi May, I'm looking for your daughter

236
00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:45,284
She's dead ?

237
00:16:45,989 --> 00:16:47,400
I'm so sorry...

238
00:16:47,402 --> 00:16:50,715
Bobby ? Its Wilson

239
00:16:50,717 --> 00:16:53,468
What's up ? It's my birthday today

240
00:16:54,863 --> 00:16:57,372
Don't talk about that stuff

241
00:16:57,374 --> 00:17:01,453
I won the lottery, I want to spend it up

242
00:17:01,455 --> 00:17:03,076
Hello ? Hello ?

243
00:17:05,402 --> 00:17:07,074
Hi, is Julie there

244
00:17:07,230 --> 00:17:09,327
Happy birthday

245
00:17:11,947 --> 00:17:13,631
Thank you

246
00:17:14,913 --> 00:17:16,597
Have you finished work ?

247
00:17:16,599 --> 00:17:18,493
Not yet. I'll come over after work

248
00:17:18,495 --> 00:17:20,468
OK, bye

249
00:17:20,470 --> 00:17:22,123
Bye

250
00:17:53,391 --> 00:17:55,484
It’s been a while

251
00:17:55,486 --> 00:17:59,441
It hasn't been that long.
We met half a year ago

252
00:18:00,424 --> 00:18:02,045
Have you been to Vietnam recently ?

253
00:18:02,047 --> 00:18:04,243
If you're going, you should be careful

254
00:18:04,245 --> 00:18:06,416
You might get caught

255
00:18:07,244 --> 00:18:10,170
Even if I'm just going there
for a bowl of noodles ?

256
00:18:10,172 --> 00:18:13,153
I thought you wanted
to stop selling alcohol,
Why are you still doing it ?

257
00:18:14,178 --> 00:18:15,800
Do you think I like it ?

258
00:18:15,802 --> 00:18:17,648
What else can I do ?

259
00:18:17,650 --> 00:18:19,946
Unless...

260
00:18:20,190 --> 00:18:21,941
You want me to be a prostitute ?

261
00:18:24,257 --> 00:18:28,714
Don't say that.  Do something respectable

262
00:18:29,969 --> 00:18:32,084
You know that 'Blue Girl' (beer)

263
00:18:32,086 --> 00:18:35,012
[ ?] got popular because she sold herself

264
00:18:35,014 --> 00:18:36,912
How about Carlsberg ?

265
00:18:37,789 --> 00:18:39,292
He was unfortunate

266
00:18:39,294 --> 00:18:41,701
He sold himself until he was an old man
before he got the brand

267
00:18:41,703 --> 00:18:44,776
Otherwise it wouldn't have been
called 'Uncle Carls' (phonetic pun)

268
00:18:48,607 --> 00:18:49,870
How about mine ?

269
00:18:50,414 --> 00:18:52,519
[ ?] Now, it’s wrong to say
that threes no future in living large

270
00:18:52,521 --> 00:18:57,053
[ ?] It was only because he lived large,
that he got the Johnnie Walker brand

271
00:18:58,706 --> 00:19:01,805
I'll let myself out later.
Let's have a shower

272
00:19:41,823 --> 00:19:44,117
Tiger, are we going to do this

273
00:19:44,395 --> 00:19:46,108
This is not for you

274
00:20:02,725 --> 00:20:04,035
Where so you want to go later ?

275
00:20:04,037 --> 00:20:06,127
- I want to go for a picnic
- OK

276
00:20:10,804 --> 00:20:12,675
Take our daughter away from here

277
00:20:37,149 --> 00:20:38,922
Cops ! Get in !

278
00:20:38,924 --> 00:20:40,040
You're lucky

279
00:21:00,683 --> 00:21:02,873
You can leave hospital at anytime

280
00:21:02,875 --> 00:21:04,768
If you keep fighting,
I won't let it go so easily

281
00:21:04,770 --> 00:21:06,925
If you want to die, do it far away from me.
Don't keep involving me

282
00:21:06,927 --> 00:21:09,586
I want to turn state witness

283
00:21:21,847 --> 00:21:23,258
Come in

284
00:21:24,366 --> 00:21:26,465
Inspector Wong, we've bought the criminal

285
00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:37,758
That hurts, Inspector Wong

286
00:21:38,705 --> 00:21:41,013
Do you have something to drink ? It’s hot.

287
00:21:41,015 --> 00:21:43,493
Shan's spilled the beans about Tony

288
00:21:44,148 --> 00:21:46,426
That’s great, go arrest him then

289
00:21:46,428 --> 00:21:48,349
[ ?] We have to prepare

290
00:21:48,568 --> 00:21:50,943
Those guys are insane,
if they wanted revenge,
the first to die would be you

291
00:21:50,945 --> 00:21:53,557
I know, I'm more scared than you

292
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:56,916
Inspector Wong, please don't tell me
you're leading the team on this one

293
00:21:56,918 --> 00:21:59,252
Relax, I won’t be leading.
I'm not the one that has been keeping
tabs on those Vietnamese kids

294
00:21:59,254 --> 00:22:01,293
Get them to call back
that handsome and outstanding officer

295
00:22:01,295 --> 00:22:03,068
This is a time
when the department needs him the most

296
00:22:03,070 --> 00:22:05,078
It's you who needs him the most

297
00:22:05,253 --> 00:22:06,020
Yes

298
00:22:09,977 --> 00:22:11,521
Inspector Wong

299
00:22:11,799 --> 00:22:13,134
Shut the door

300
00:22:13,326 --> 00:22:14,458
What are you doing ?

301
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:16,347
Do you want me to die,
opening the door so wide

302
00:22:16,814 --> 00:22:20,090
This time just speak
your mind if there is anything

303
00:22:20,092 --> 00:22:22,517
Fine, otherwise,
why would we call you back ?

304
00:22:22,519 --> 00:22:24,891
Help us out, solve this case,
and we can all go swimming OK ?

305
00:22:24,893 --> 00:22:26,084
Yes, Inspector Wong

306
00:22:26,086 --> 00:22:27,700
Here, put this on your head

307
00:22:28,843 --> 00:22:29,975
Put it on

308
00:22:29,977 --> 00:22:32,708
- Let me finish my smoke
- Forget it, put it out

309
00:22:32,710 --> 00:22:34,075
You won't get any girls

310
00:22:34,077 --> 00:22:38,060
Put it on, you fuckwit

311
00:22:38,062 --> 00:22:40,302
Inspector Wong, he's not co-operating

312
00:22:40,304 --> 00:22:41,834
Take him out for a beating, then

313
00:22:41,836 --> 00:22:45,260
We're about to have the '97 Handover,
can you guys take things
a little more seriously ?

314
00:22:46,081 --> 00:22:47,885
It’s their mother's big birthday tonight

315
00:22:47,887 --> 00:22:49,957
The 3 will definitely come out tonight

316
00:22:49,959 --> 00:22:52,308
First we take care of their associates

317
00:22:55,990 --> 00:22:59,956
Four eyes, we want to interview you
back at the station
about the Vietnamese case

318
00:23:02,637 --> 00:23:03,744
OK

319
00:23:04,085 --> 00:23:06,160
Brother Wilson

320
00:23:06,398 --> 00:23:07,874
Brother Wilson

321
00:23:08,469 --> 00:23:10,311
- Eat, try a bit
- This way Sir

322
00:23:10,313 --> 00:23:12,860
- It smells good, try it
- Auntie

323
00:23:13,482 --> 00:23:16,624
Wishing you fortunes deeper
than the Eastern Sea, happiness higher
than the Southern mountains

324
00:23:16,626 --> 00:23:19,604
That you become prettier year by year,
and that you are forever youthful

325
00:23:19,606 --> 00:23:21,500
- Thank you...
- Thank you

326
00:23:21,502 --> 00:23:22,543
Auntie, is your appetite good today ?

327
00:23:22,545 --> 00:23:26,049
Stop talking to her, she’s stopped eating

328
00:23:26,217 --> 00:23:27,450
- OK
- Leave

329
00:23:27,452 --> 00:23:29,480
Auntie, enjoy your meal

330
00:23:29,749 --> 00:23:31,279
If they don't return the calls,
then keep calling

331
00:23:31,281 --> 00:23:34,663
You don't need me to tell you that.
What time is it already ? Nobody's here

332
00:23:34,665 --> 00:23:37,531
- Have a bite
- Mother fucker, go !

333
00:23:39,544 --> 00:23:41,700
Here, have a bit

334
00:23:43,488 --> 00:23:44,738
Tiger

335
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:46,256
Come here

336
00:23:48,482 --> 00:23:50,657
You're so loud
that mothers' not eating any more

337
00:23:50,659 --> 00:23:52,054
Kneel

338
00:23:53,350 --> 00:23:55,081
Apologize to mother

339
00:23:55,858 --> 00:23:58,892
Mother, please eat some

340
00:24:05,890 --> 00:24:07,892
Everyone's here

341
00:24:07,894 --> 00:24:13,047
If no one goes to see Zha,
who will be there to celebrate
their mother's birthday ?

342
00:24:13,241 --> 00:24:15,100
Have a mouthful

343
00:24:15,102 --> 00:24:17,073
Eat

344
00:24:18,406 --> 00:24:21,019
If you don't want this,
then what do you want ?

345
00:24:30,254 --> 00:24:31,764
You don't like it ?

346
00:24:31,766 --> 00:24:34,693
We'll order something else, OK ?
Sea cucumber ?

347
00:24:35,608 --> 00:24:37,863
Abalone ? You don't like it ?

348
00:24:37,865 --> 00:24:40,211
Then I'll order Birds Nest Soup for you

349
00:24:40,509 --> 00:24:42,170
Sharks Fin ?

350
00:24:42,291 --> 00:24:44,772
Big Brother, something's wrong

351
00:24:44,774 --> 00:24:47,979
What's more important
than mother not eating ?

352
00:24:50,214 --> 00:24:50,947
Eat

353
00:24:50,949 --> 00:24:53,207
Tiger, feed mother

354
00:24:53,497 --> 00:24:55,991
Time to work...

355
00:24:56,432 --> 00:24:58,706
Stay here tonight

356
00:24:58,708 --> 00:25:00,414
Someone will take care of you

357
00:25:01,494 --> 00:25:03,912
You must catch them, Inspector Ma

358
00:25:08,216 --> 00:25:09,282
Here

359
00:25:12,719 --> 00:25:14,668
Have a mouthful

360
00:25:16,418 --> 00:25:18,653
The food here doesn't suit you

361
00:25:18,655 --> 00:25:20,083
I'll take you somewhere else, OK ?

362
00:25:20,085 --> 00:25:21,508
- Tiger
- Where ?

363
00:25:21,510 --> 00:25:22,730
Don't worry, let's go

364
00:25:22,732 --> 00:25:24,816
Wilson, come here

365
00:25:24,818 --> 00:25:26,090
Coming

366
00:25:26,315 --> 00:25:27,757
- They're all waiting for you there
- Quickly

367
00:25:27,759 --> 00:25:28,571
OK

368
00:25:28,573 --> 00:25:30,547
Manager

369
00:25:35,017 --> 00:25:36,237
Did you drive today ?

370
00:25:36,239 --> 00:25:39,149
Which car ? Where is it parked ?

371
00:25:49,253 --> 00:25:50,250
Hello ?

372
00:25:50,252 --> 00:25:52,064
Tony, go and get the money

373
00:25:52,066 --> 00:25:53,980
I'll leave with mother first.
We'll meet at the pier

374
00:25:53,982 --> 00:25:55,451
Understood

375
00:25:57,301 --> 00:25:58,658
Where to, Tony ?

376
00:25:58,660 --> 00:25:59,947
To the garage

377
00:26:00,478 --> 00:26:02,797
Second brother, what’s happening ?

378
00:26:09,788 --> 00:26:11,934
- Have you seen these people ?
- What time was that at ?

379
00:26:12,798 --> 00:26:13,954
- Inspector Ma
- What's the situation ?

380
00:26:13,956 --> 00:26:15,645
There is someone injured,
an ambulance is coming

381
00:26:19,637 --> 00:26:20,747
Xiao Ying

382
00:26:21,070 --> 00:26:22,233
- Check his vehicle rego
- Yes

383
00:26:22,235 --> 00:26:23,590
- Xiao Ya, tie up the loose ends here
- Yes

384
00:26:27,003 --> 00:26:27,868
Hello ?

385
00:26:27,870 --> 00:26:31,090
Where are you ? I'm at your front door

386
00:26:31,092 --> 00:26:33,583
I’m busy. I'll call you back later

387
00:26:35,734 --> 00:26:38,012
I can wait here for you to come back

388
00:26:38,014 --> 00:26:39,827
Not tonight

389
00:26:39,829 --> 00:26:41,210
I've already made a spare key for you

390
00:26:41,212 --> 00:26:43,731
I'll give it to you next time

391
00:26:44,783 --> 00:26:46,793
Can you not talk on the phone

392
00:26:46,795 --> 00:26:48,168
Sorry

393
00:27:00,466 --> 00:27:03,522
Da Pao, the target vehicle is
a dark green Mazda MPV

394
00:27:03,524 --> 00:27:05,794

395
00:27:05,796 --> 00:27:07,492

397
00:27:48,817 --> 00:27:51,078
Help out

398
00:28:18,877 --> 00:28:21,206
Brother Tiger, did you lock the door ?

399
00:28:21,323 --> 00:28:22,158
Oh yeah

400
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:25,069
I'll do it, you get in the car first

401
00:28:37,694 --> 00:28:40,197
They're leaving with the money,
call you later

402
00:28:57,192 --> 00:28:58,520
We can go now, Brother Tony

403
00:28:58,522 --> 00:29:00,818
- Have you locked it ?
- I have

404
00:29:10,467 --> 00:29:12,119
Sit in the back

405
00:29:12,806 --> 00:29:14,240
OK

406
00:29:30,691 --> 00:29:32,832
That's the car

407
00:29:40,784 --> 00:29:44,671
Wilson, give me your phone

408
00:29:51,444 --> 00:29:52,930
Brother Tony

409
00:30:10,849 --> 00:30:13,475
Mother, sit tight

410
00:30:14,272 --> 00:30:15,958
Don't drive so fast

411
00:30:42,620 --> 00:30:44,469
Pull over

412
00:30:44,471 --> 00:30:45,948
I said, pull over

413
00:30:48,079 --> 00:30:49,559
Mother, sit tight

414
00:30:56,423 --> 00:30:58,132
Jia Hui, ChangAn direction

415
00:30:58,451 --> 00:31:00,340
Are you alright.  Hang in there

416
00:31:00,342 --> 00:31:03,102
- I want to vomit.
- Vomit in here

417
00:31:03,104 --> 00:31:05,050
You'll feel better after you bring it up

418
00:31:05,118 --> 00:31:07,135
It's alright

419
00:31:12,345 --> 00:31:13,969
We in the chemical factory district

420
00:31:50,895 --> 00:31:52,732
Get out

421
00:32:24,258 --> 00:32:27,118
We're going to the pier

422
00:33:13,609 --> 00:33:15,649
Have a look

423
00:33:22,161 --> 00:33:23,972
Hey, Sir

424
00:33:23,974 --> 00:33:25,090
Are you alright ?

425
00:33:28,757 --> 00:33:30,176
- How's Wilson ?
- Inspector Wong

426
00:33:30,178 --> 00:33:32,166
Don't know yet, they're working on him

427
00:33:32,339 --> 00:33:34,641
If he can be saved then it’s alright.
Stay calm

428
00:33:37,749 --> 00:33:38,728
Hey, what are you doing ?

429
00:33:38,730 --> 00:33:40,432
I won't let you off

430
00:33:40,434 --> 00:33:41,094
What are you doing ?

431
00:33:41,096 --> 00:33:42,529
What's it to you

432
00:33:42,818 --> 00:33:43,968
Are you Julie ?

433
00:33:43,970 --> 00:33:45,399
Assaulting a police officer,
I can charge you

434
00:33:45,401 --> 00:33:46,726
So what if you're a cop ?

435
00:33:46,728 --> 00:33:48,727
Wilson is my partner

436
00:33:52,955 --> 00:33:55,028
He is also a cop

437
00:34:31,801 --> 00:34:34,140
What are you in for ? Triad activity ?

438
00:34:34,393 --> 00:34:35,504
I'm not a Triad member

439
00:34:35,506 --> 00:34:37,918
No ? Then follow me

440
00:34:38,895 --> 00:34:41,685
Call me Brother Zha

441
00:34:42,145 --> 00:34:43,680
Do it

442
00:34:43,852 --> 00:34:45,356
Brother Zha

443
00:34:46,990 --> 00:34:49,602
Have you ever seen your
3 son's beating up others ?

444
00:34:49,604 --> 00:34:52,669
I have 3 sons ?

445
00:34:54,367 --> 00:34:57,138
I've never seen it

446
00:34:57,492 --> 00:35:02,796
Sir, can you call the police for me ?

447
00:35:04,230 --> 00:35:07,368
Sir, call the police for me

448
00:35:09,222 --> 00:35:13,107
My son is missing

449
00:35:17,191 --> 00:35:19,651
No one will come to see her on holidays

450
00:35:19,653 --> 00:35:22,365
Perhaps, never at any other time either

451
00:35:22,539 --> 00:35:25,964
Take care of her for me.
She tends to wander

452
00:35:33,279 --> 00:35:37,281
It's my birthday. I'm 80.
You should have come earlier

453
00:35:37,283 --> 00:35:40,424
I'm 80...

454
00:35:43,383 --> 00:35:46,433
Xian Wei Zha,
there is sufficient evidence to show

455
00:35:46,435 --> 00:35:49,342
That during the period from 1992 to Feb 1997

456
00:35:49,344 --> 00:35:53,371
you were involved in smuggling,
aggravated assault, and Triad activities

457
00:35:53,373 --> 00:35:56,117
Those are the charges. How do you plead ?

458
00:35:56,637 --> 00:35:58,689
Not guilty

459
00:35:59,290 --> 00:36:01,342
Hearing is set for May this year

460
00:36:01,344 --> 00:36:03,705
Transfer the case
to the North Kowloon courts

461
00:36:03,707 --> 00:36:07,094
Use this time to gather your reasons

462
00:36:07,096 --> 00:36:09,222
You are denied bail
or permission to leave the country

463
00:36:09,224 --> 00:36:12,278
All your assets are now frozen

464
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:13,694
Until sentence is passed

465
00:36:14,989 --> 00:36:15,998
You're putting it all on me

466
00:36:16,032 --> 00:36:17,983
You think you can convict me ?

467
00:36:18,428 --> 00:36:19,180
Let's go

468
00:36:19,182 --> 00:36:21,779
Take your wandering hands off me

469
00:36:22,152 --> 00:36:23,289
I'll sue you for sexual assault

470
00:36:23,291 --> 00:36:24,542
Let's go

471
00:36:27,794 --> 00:36:29,621
3 months later

472
00:36:37,654 --> 00:36:39,399
I won't be able to keep up with you soon

473
00:36:39,401 --> 00:36:41,432
Then I'll slow down to wait for you

474
00:36:41,434 --> 00:36:44,252
Take it slowly. You'll get used to it

475
00:36:44,590 --> 00:36:46,148
Of course it will be slow

476
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:49,175
I've lost the use on a leg,
you think I'll get used to that ?

477
00:36:49,964 --> 00:36:52,219
Everything's sorted out for you

478
00:36:52,221 --> 00:36:55,951
Next week,
you'll be changed to a desk job

479
00:36:56,078 --> 00:36:57,560
Desk job ?

480
00:36:57,562 --> 00:37:00,052
Why don't you get the HK government
to pay me some compensation ?

481
00:37:00,054 --> 00:37:03,721
Not only won't they pay,
but and I have to cough up my own legal fees

482
00:37:04,056 --> 00:37:07,742
Are you kidding me ? Is this what
you call 'everything's sorted' ?

483
00:37:07,744 --> 00:37:10,216
You know everything
I've done for the force

484
00:37:10,218 --> 00:37:12,235
What have I got out of it ?

485
00:37:12,237 --> 00:37:17,106
When I am out,
which path will lead to wealth ?

486
00:37:17,869 --> 00:37:20,810
There are so many colleagues
waiting for your return, why don't you
persevere for a bit longer ?

487
00:37:20,812 --> 00:37:23,015
I'm persevering now

488
00:37:23,519 --> 00:37:27,053
How many people are waiting for my return,
just one ?

489
00:37:27,969 --> 00:37:30,737
I've forgotten something,
don't wait for me

490
00:37:35,815 --> 00:37:37,394
Slowly...

491
00:37:53,064 --> 00:37:57,780
Big brother,
Tiger and I will return before your trial

492
00:37:58,438 --> 00:38:02,590
I won’t give Wilson
or Shan the opportunity to testify

493
00:38:17,294 --> 00:38:18,560
Tiger

494
00:38:31,794 --> 00:38:33,217
Mother

495
00:38:36,246 --> 00:38:39,361
3 sons

496
00:38:40,352 --> 00:38:42,599
I'll take you home

497
00:38:45,355 --> 00:38:48,803
Mother, do you remember this place ?

498
00:38:48,805 --> 00:38:50,736
We used to live here

499
00:38:50,738 --> 00:38:54,032
After I pickup Big brother,
we can leave HK

500
00:39:34,253 --> 00:39:35,623
Give me

501
00:39:36,145 --> 00:39:36,901
What are you smiling about ?

502
00:39:36,903 --> 00:39:40,041
Nothing.  Perhaps injuring
your leg wasn't completely a bad thing

503
00:39:40,043 --> 00:39:41,520
This way you can't run amok every day

504
00:39:41,522 --> 00:39:43,621
And can stay home a keep me company

505
00:39:44,188 --> 00:39:45,715
You've taken care of me for so long

506
00:39:45,717 --> 00:39:47,796
You must like me a lot

507
00:39:47,798 --> 00:39:49,466
Don't you know
that in the DNA of every woman

508
00:39:49,468 --> 00:39:52,361
is encoded a natural ability
to care for others

509
00:39:53,041 --> 00:39:56,060
On behalf of your godly inherited ability,

510
00:39:56,062 --> 00:39:58,082
I hope that it will be like this forever

511
00:39:58,084 --> 00:39:59,054
Thanks

512
00:39:59,056 --> 00:40:01,099
Don't mention it

513
00:40:13,466 --> 00:40:14,862
They're here

514
00:40:16,061 --> 00:40:17,217
I want to get changed

515
00:40:17,219 --> 00:40:19,151
- Careful
- Quickly

516
00:40:21,431 --> 00:40:22,255
- Hello
- Hello

517
00:40:22,257 --> 00:40:23,673
Delivery

518
00:40:25,476 --> 00:40:27,313
Be careful

519
00:40:28,233 --> 00:40:30,382
Come and have a look.  It's good stuff

520
00:40:35,534 --> 00:40:36,396
Is it that good ?

521
00:40:36,398 --> 00:40:37,612
Its heavier than a throne

522
00:40:37,614 --> 00:40:40,199
How can you live on the roof ?
I'm so tired

523
00:40:40,201 --> 00:40:41,686
We only helped carry it

524
00:40:41,688 --> 00:40:43,876
Jun, he bought it and delivered it

525
00:40:43,878 --> 00:40:45,592
Where do you want it ?

526
00:40:46,621 --> 00:40:47,847
Over there

527
00:40:48,096 --> 00:40:49,262
OK

528
00:40:49,264 --> 00:40:51,942
Move over

529
00:40:52,107 --> 00:40:54,222
Put some muscle into it

530
00:40:55,046 --> 00:40:57,226
Slowly, don't scratch it

531
00:40:57,228 --> 00:40:59,584
That cost over $30k.  He paid for it himself

532
00:40:59,586 --> 00:41:01,992
That's sincerity.  Accept it

533
00:41:02,158 --> 00:41:03,963
- Do you have a power board ?
- Yes

534
00:41:04,216 --> 00:41:07,377
Here, let me do that.
You guys are so useless

535
00:41:07,950 --> 00:41:09,350
Where's the power point ?

536
00:41:13,730 --> 00:41:16,142
I know you're no good with English,
so it's in Chinese

537
00:41:16,144 --> 00:41:18,899
Like driving, it's automatic

538
00:41:18,901 --> 00:41:20,841
Try using this button

539
00:41:22,052 --> 00:41:23,675
You always said that your leg hurt

540
00:41:23,677 --> 00:41:26,162
This can help improve
the circulation to your leg

541
00:41:26,164 --> 00:41:30,237
The blood moves freely to the leg,
but the leg itself can't

542
00:41:32,616 --> 00:41:34,828
Walking should be simple for a person
with your intelligence and constitution,

543
00:41:34,830 --> 00:41:37,954
Train your right leg to be as mobile
as your left leg, and you'll be fine

544
00:41:40,388 --> 00:41:41,745
What did you say ?

545
00:41:41,747 --> 00:41:44,256
A joke

546
00:41:48,821 --> 00:41:51,668
It’s so funny, but no-ones laughing.
Forget it.

547
00:41:56,049 --> 00:41:57,455
I'll get it

548
00:42:00,202 --> 00:42:01,518
Takeaway delivery

549
00:42:03,953 --> 00:42:05,391
Smells good

550
00:42:06,763 --> 00:42:07,885
What is it ?

551
00:42:07,887 --> 00:42:09,016
Something good

552
00:42:15,177 --> 00:42:18,375
Actually as a cop, there's a lot of pressure

553
00:42:18,377 --> 00:42:20,372
Why don't you have a think about
doing something else ?

554
00:42:21,139 --> 00:42:24,653
Have a good think about it.
Whatever you do, include me

555
00:42:28,635 --> 00:42:31,745
I'm scared that you'll just hit everything

556
00:42:39,418 --> 00:42:41,400
Actually,
the most important thing is having a family

557
00:42:41,402 --> 00:42:43,073
I envy you

558
00:42:43,289 --> 00:42:45,758
What's more important than family ?

559
00:42:45,866 --> 00:42:48,509
If you're like me, you'll be happy

560
00:42:49,233 --> 00:42:51,125
Come over and eat

561
00:42:58,848 --> 00:43:00,583
Wait, let's take a picture first

562
00:43:00,585 --> 00:43:01,565
OK, take a picture as we eat

563
00:43:01,567 --> 00:43:03,018
No, picture first

564
00:43:03,020 --> 00:43:04,684
This is my only request

565
00:43:05,448 --> 00:43:06,412
Picture with the chicken ?

566
00:43:06,414 --> 00:43:08,648
Whatever, just go with it

567
00:43:08,879 --> 00:43:10,114
Come

568
00:43:23,180 --> 00:43:25,122
The chicken is a bit cold.

569
00:43:25,316 --> 00:43:26,391
Wait

570
00:43:26,870 --> 00:43:27,807
Let's heat it up

571
00:43:27,809 --> 00:43:29,508
If we don't improve our standards,
how can we become better people ?

572
00:43:29,510 --> 00:43:31,860
It doesn't matter, we can still eat it

573
00:43:33,075 --> 00:43:35,722
It’s so easy to heat it up

574
00:43:43,819 --> 00:43:46,305
Chicken, 200 degrees

575
00:43:46,307 --> 00:43:48,568
- I'll go help Inspector Wong
- (So don't eat it, Da Pao)

576
00:45:19,268 --> 00:45:21,188
Is Julie alright ?

577
00:45:24,040 --> 00:45:26,192
She's staying for observation

578
00:45:31,863 --> 00:45:33,860
Are you alright ?

579
00:45:39,147 --> 00:45:42,004
I'm temporarily
standing in for Inspector Wong

580
00:45:44,323 --> 00:45:47,210
For security reasons,
you are all placed on leave

581
00:45:49,892 --> 00:45:53,529
They're killing police,
and killing witnesses

582
00:45:53,910 --> 00:45:57,172
Even a retard would know
that those Vietnamese are behind it.
And you want us to take a break ?

583
00:45:57,174 --> 00:45:59,183
I'm worried for your safety

584
00:45:59,521 --> 00:46:01,016
We're all risking our lives

585
00:46:01,018 --> 00:46:03,055
You step in charge, and the first thing
you do is put us on leave ?

586
00:46:04,729 --> 00:46:07,705
You're feeling confused
and emotional right now, please leave

587
00:46:09,537 --> 00:46:12,810
When I was undercover, I was living under
the cover of fear every day

588
00:46:12,812 --> 00:46:14,934
I thought that once I mangled my leg
that I would never have another good day

589
00:46:14,936 --> 00:46:16,848
But even then, they blow up my home

590
00:46:16,850 --> 00:46:18,896
Now you want me to leave ?
Madam,

591
00:46:18,898 --> 00:46:21,760
The uniform you're wearing
was not meant to be so casually abused

592
00:46:21,762 --> 00:46:23,948
If there is sufficient evidence,
I will arrest the people involved

593
00:46:23,950 --> 00:46:26,255
Do you have any evidence ?

594
00:46:33,178 --> 00:46:35,538
You guys ask Madam,
what else needs to be done

595
00:47:43,260 --> 00:47:46,138
Where is Tony ?

596
00:47:50,879 --> 00:47:52,966
Enough ! You're going to kill him

597
00:47:55,755 --> 00:47:57,812
Give me your gun
Give me your gun

598
00:47:57,814 --> 00:47:59,086
Give me your gun

599
00:47:59,898 --> 00:48:01,112
Give me your gun

600
00:48:05,116 --> 00:48:05,931
Give me your gun

601
00:48:05,933 --> 00:48:09,937
He doesn't know.  Go to court tomorrow

602
00:49:36,610 --> 00:49:39,701
Madam, what do we do now ?

603
00:49:42,070 --> 00:49:44,934
The most important thing now,
is to find out what happened to Tony

604
00:49:45,368 --> 00:49:48,289
The most important thing now
is to protect Wilson in hospital

605
00:49:48,690 --> 00:49:50,222
He is the only witness

606
00:49:52,219 --> 00:49:53,323
Xiao Ying, let's go

607
00:49:53,325 --> 00:49:55,387
Let's go, Xiao Ya
What are you still writing ?

608
00:49:58,213 --> 00:50:01,148
My mother has a place in the country

609
00:50:02,025 --> 00:50:04,230
I really want to return to Song Flower River

610
00:50:05,575 --> 00:50:07,935
Do you know
why it is called Song Flower River ?

611
00:50:10,175 --> 00:50:13,364
There was a story from long ago

612
00:50:13,366 --> 00:50:16,335
The Song tree used to be able to bloom

613
00:50:16,719 --> 00:50:21,577
The people from my area,
all had to leave to earn a living

614
00:50:21,579 --> 00:50:25,651
Before they left, they would pluck
a Song Flower as a memento

615
00:50:25,884 --> 00:50:30,023
They told the tree that they were just
borrowing it, and would definitely
come back to return it.

616
00:50:31,243 --> 00:50:33,863
But as they left, one by one

617
00:50:33,865 --> 00:50:36,656
None of them ever returned

618
00:50:37,664 --> 00:50:40,686
In the end,
the Song Flower could not blossom

619
00:50:41,199 --> 00:50:43,937
In order to remember it

620
00:50:43,939 --> 00:50:47,388
The people there named the river,
the Song Flower River

621
00:50:52,103 --> 00:50:54,199
You're sick of this place ?

622
00:50:57,071 --> 00:50:59,893
Actually, living in HK for this long

623
00:50:59,895 --> 00:51:02,535
I've never felt that this place was home

624
00:51:07,269 --> 00:51:09,651
Mother said that she would like us to return

625
00:51:10,593 --> 00:51:13,294
The 3 of us

626
00:51:18,390 --> 00:51:20,645
It's 2 months now

627
00:51:28,603 --> 00:51:31,292
You don't like it ?

628
00:51:45,723 --> 00:51:47,460
Everyone entering
the hospital must be searched

629
00:51:47,462 --> 00:51:50,758
All the exits, doorways, backdoors,
back stairs, toilets,

630
00:51:50,760 --> 00:51:52,480
Must all have men posted. Understood ?

631
00:51:52,482 --> 00:51:53,427
Yes

632
00:51:53,429 --> 00:51:55,860
Nothing must happen to Wilson
before he goes to court

633
00:51:57,265 --> 00:51:59,633
The baby's hungry

634
00:51:59,761 --> 00:52:02,025
Should we give it something to eat ?

635
00:52:02,818 --> 00:52:05,298
I'll go buy something for you to eat

636
00:52:10,202 --> 00:52:12,391
Don't go anywhere

637
00:52:59,698 --> 00:53:01,547
Inspector Ma, wait

638
00:53:01,549 --> 00:53:03,834
Wilson,
Inspector Ma told you not to go anywhere

639
00:53:03,836 --> 00:53:05,421
Thanks

640
00:53:17,848 --> 00:53:20,529
Police ! Move

641
00:53:31,891 --> 00:53:33,358
Shots fired inside elevator.
The elevator is heading for the roof

642
00:53:33,360 --> 00:53:34,949
Get backup.  Quickly

643
00:55:10,316 --> 00:55:11,430
She's here with me

644
00:55:11,432 --> 00:55:12,993
OK

645
00:55:12,995 --> 00:55:14,813
What do you want ?

646
00:55:15,512 --> 00:55:16,957
You're scared ?

647
00:55:16,959 --> 00:55:18,950
Yes, yes

648
00:55:18,952 --> 00:55:21,818
Whatever you want, just say it.
I'll do anything

649
00:55:32,088 --> 00:55:34,560
Watch out.
You have a death wish ?

650
00:56:03,898 --> 00:56:05,408
Move

651
00:56:12,493 --> 00:56:14,096
Mummy

652
00:56:16,122 --> 00:56:17,917
Throw the gun over here

653
00:56:18,509 --> 00:56:20,660
Put the child down

654
00:56:20,724 --> 00:56:22,648
I said throw the gun over

655
00:56:24,589 --> 00:56:26,260
Can you hear me ?

656
00:56:26,318 --> 00:56:28,033
Put the child down

657
00:56:28,035 --> 00:56:30,425
Do you want her to die ?

658
00:59:17,953 --> 00:59:20,156
Inspector Ma, what's the situation ?

659
00:59:21,233 --> 00:59:22,973
Inspector Ma

660
00:59:57,913 --> 01:00:00,777
It’s time to go to court

661
01:00:37,763 --> 01:00:39,124
Hello ?

662
01:00:39,126 --> 01:00:41,076
Wilson, where are you ?

663
01:00:41,078 --> 01:00:42,398
I'm heading off to court

664
01:00:42,400 --> 01:00:44,502
Did something happen to your Julie ?

665
01:00:46,835 --> 01:00:47,997
Yes

666
01:00:49,094 --> 01:00:52,609
Don't believe them.
They'll never just let her go

667
01:00:54,644 --> 01:00:56,563
I have no choice

668
01:00:57,025 --> 01:00:58,608
How can you not have a choice ?

669
01:00:58,610 --> 01:01:01,534
You've chosen to help those bastards

670
01:01:02,116 --> 01:01:03,380
I don't want anything to happen to her

671
01:01:03,382 --> 01:01:05,059
I don't want anything
to happen to the both of you

672
01:01:05,061 --> 01:01:07,605
Do you want to die with her ?

673
01:01:41,114 --> 01:01:43,105
You need to record a statement

674
01:01:44,507 --> 01:01:46,910
You beat the criminal to death

675
01:01:46,912 --> 01:01:48,711
Then arrest me

676
01:01:57,258 --> 01:01:59,881
Witness.  You can now testify

677
01:02:26,021 --> 01:02:28,368
I don't remember anything

678
01:02:34,442 --> 01:02:36,209
[ ?] My judgment is

679
01:02:36,211 --> 01:02:39,784
The witness is unable
to testify because he claims amnesia

680
01:02:39,786 --> 01:02:42,712
All charges against the accused...

681
01:02:42,714 --> 01:02:46,440
are dropped due to lack of evidence

682
01:03:17,577 --> 01:03:19,070
Tony

683
01:03:19,582 --> 01:03:21,884
I'm out

684
01:03:41,393 --> 01:03:44,542
Speak. Where ?

685
01:03:44,544 --> 01:03:45,765
South ShengWei

686
01:03:47,077 --> 01:03:50,811
Come quickly. I'll be waiting

687
01:03:52,308 --> 01:03:54,619
Stop it.  Don't hit him

688
01:03:56,012 --> 01:03:57,811
Stop hitting him

689
01:03:57,813 --> 01:03:59,750
Wilson

690
01:04:00,157 --> 01:04:02,188
Wilson

691
01:04:03,760 --> 01:04:06,822
I never thought
that I would be able to leave

692
01:04:06,824 --> 01:04:09,875
I just want you to let her go

693
01:04:10,442 --> 01:04:13,469
Wilson

694
01:06:31,124 --> 01:06:33,333
Shoot, shoot him, Tony

695
01:06:35,496 --> 01:06:37,658
Come on, you scared ?

696
01:06:37,965 --> 01:06:40,482
Drop the gun, drop the gun

697
01:06:40,484 --> 01:06:41,564
Your momma...

698
01:06:41,566 --> 01:06:42,717
- Bastard
- Shoot

699
01:06:42,719 --> 01:06:44,085
Don't talk about my mother !

700
01:07:06,314 --> 01:07:07,621
Boss

701
01:07:35,827 --> 01:07:37,135
I'm going to kill you two bastards

702
01:07:41,208 --> 01:07:42,134
Fuck

703
01:09:29,536 --> 01:09:31,357
I'll drive

704
01:09:44,939 --> 01:09:46,491
Open the door

705
01:09:46,493 --> 01:09:48,680
What are you thinking ? Open the door

706
01:09:48,682 --> 01:09:50,347
What are you doing ?

707
01:09:50,808 --> 01:09:54,032
Leave with me.  Don't go back

708
01:09:54,264 --> 01:09:57,379
Leave with me.  You promised you wouldn't go

709
01:10:13,564 --> 01:10:15,296
Ma Jun, come out and fight

710
01:10:35,153 --> 01:10:36,561
Fuck you

711
01:10:38,907 --> 01:10:40,215
Ammo

712
01:15:09,290 --> 01:15:11,148
Mother

713
01:15:12,984 --> 01:15:17,095
I have three sons, they're missing

714
01:15:17,097 --> 01:15:20,058
Have you seen them ?

715
01:15:30,474 --> 01:15:33,991
I've lost my 3 sons

716
01:15:33,993 --> 01:15:37,648
Can you help find them for me ?

717
01:15:37,650 --> 01:15:43,071
Have you seen them ? I have 3 sons...

718
01:15:43,073 --> 01:15:46,371
I have 3 sons...

719
01:15:47,508 --> 01:15:50,554
Have you seen them ?

720
01:19:56,925 --> 01:19:59,114
You're finished, Tony

721
01:22:57,298 --> 01:23:00,462
All the time I've been in the force,
have I ever arrested the wrong person ?

722
01:23:00,464 --> 01:23:03,370
This question, I'll leave to the judge

723
01:23:03,372 --> 01:23:06,401
My philosophy is...

724
01:23:06,403 --> 01:23:08,580
that cops catch crooks

725
01:23:08,582 --> 01:23:11,418
Everything that I've done...

726
01:23:11,591 --> 01:23:14,130
Has been to maintain the peace.
