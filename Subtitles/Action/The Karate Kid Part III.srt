1
00:00:00,043 --> 00:00:02,837
Fear does not exist in this <i>dojo</i>.
Does it?

2
00:00:02,921 --> 00:00:04,172
No, <i>Sensei</i>!

3
00:00:04,339 --> 00:00:07,300
Pain does not exist in this <i>dojo</i>.
Does it?

4
00:00:07,383 --> 00:00:08,635
No, <i>Sensei</i>!

5
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:11,763
Defeat does not exist in this <i>dojo</i>.
Does it?

6
00:00:11,846 --> 00:00:13,264
No, <i>Sensei</i>!

7
00:00:13,348 --> 00:00:16,476
Fear does not exist in this <i>dojo</i>.
Does it?

8
00:00:16,601 --> 00:00:17,894
No, <i>Sensei</i>!

9
00:00:17,977 --> 00:00:21,147
Pain does not exist in this <i>dojo</i>.
Does it?

10
00:00:21,397 --> 00:00:22,607
No, <i>Sensei</i>!

11
00:00:22,690 --> 00:00:26,236
Defeat does not exist in this <i>dojo</i>.
Does it?

12
00:00:26,361 --> 00:00:27,779
No, <i>Sensei</i>!

13
00:00:28,154 --> 00:00:29,447
Prepare!

14
00:00:32,659 --> 00:00:36,246
We do not train to be merciful here.
Mercy is for the weak.

15
00:00:36,538 --> 00:00:41,126
Here, on the street, in competition,
a man confronts you, he's the enemy.

16
00:00:41,626 --> 00:00:45,171
An enemy deserves no mercy.
What is the problem, Mr. Lawrence?

17
00:00:48,425 --> 00:00:50,802
Class, we have visitors.

18
00:00:57,475 --> 00:01:00,353
I hear you jumped
some of my students last night.

19
00:01:00,645 --> 00:01:02,772
Afraid the facts mixed up.

20
00:01:03,231 --> 00:01:06,734
Now you get your boy on the mat
or you and I will have a major problem.

21
00:01:06,818 --> 00:01:09,279
Too much advantage, your <i>dojo</i>.

22
00:01:10,864 --> 00:01:12,365
Name a place.

23
00:01:12,949 --> 00:01:14,367
Tournament.

24
00:01:15,785 --> 00:01:17,996
Come on, Johnny, kill him!

25
00:01:21,416 --> 00:01:23,877
<i>Point! Chop! That's two for LaRusso!</i>

26
00:01:24,919 --> 00:01:26,588
Time out, time out.

27
00:01:26,796 --> 00:01:29,048
Go to your <i>sensei</i>. Turn. Kneel.

28
00:01:29,674 --> 00:01:31,926
Hey, Johnny, you're a cream-puff!

29
00:01:33,511 --> 00:01:35,054
Sweep the leg.

30
00:01:37,182 --> 00:01:39,142
You have a problem with that?

31
00:01:41,311 --> 00:01:42,729
No, <i>Sensei</i>.

32
00:01:44,564 --> 00:01:45,899
No mercy.

33
00:01:52,655 --> 00:01:55,200
Warning for illegal contact to the knees.

34
00:01:55,909 --> 00:01:56,743
Ready?

35
00:01:56,826 --> 00:01:58,953
No mercy! No mercy!

36
00:01:59,162 --> 00:02:00,830
Weigh the fist, Johnny.

37
00:02:00,914 --> 00:02:02,332
Finish him!

38
00:02:11,758 --> 00:02:13,009
Winner!

39
00:02:21,518 --> 00:02:22,852
Now who's the loser?

40
00:02:22,936 --> 00:02:24,687
You're really sick, man.

41
00:02:24,813 --> 00:02:26,981
How does second place feel now?

42
00:02:27,065 --> 00:02:29,109
- He can't breathe.
- Mind your business.

43
00:02:29,192 --> 00:02:32,529
- You're gonna kill him.
- <i>Sensei</i>, please. You're hurting him.

44
00:02:32,612 --> 00:02:34,823
He's sorry, okay? He really is.

45
00:02:36,324 --> 00:02:37,408
Let him go.

46
00:02:37,492 --> 00:02:39,619
Beat it, slope, or you're next.

47
00:03:13,611 --> 00:03:15,530
"Mercy is for the weak.

48
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:18,658
"We do not train to be merciful here.

49
00:03:19,075 --> 00:03:21,536
"A man face you, he is enemy.

50
00:03:22,495 --> 00:03:25,331
"Enemy deserve no mercy."

51
00:03:39,846 --> 00:03:41,222
Come, Daniel-<i>san</i>.

52
00:03:41,514 --> 00:03:43,016
Time go home.

53
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:46,186
- You could have killed him, couldn't you?
- <i>Hai.</i>

54
00:03:46,269 --> 00:03:47,645
Why didn't you then?

55
00:03:47,729 --> 00:03:51,524
<i>Because, Daniel</i>-san<i>,</i>
<i>for person with no forgiveness in heart...</i>

56
00:03:51,608 --> 00:03:54,527
<i>... living even worse punishment</i>
<i>than death.</i>

57
00:04:59,175 --> 00:05:03,263
Sensei <i>Kreese, this is Pat Johnson</i>
<i>from the All Valley Tournament.</i>

58
00:05:03,346 --> 00:05:05,306
<i>We're sorry you lost all your students.</i>

59
00:05:05,390 --> 00:05:08,393
<i>I guess the Cobra Kai won't</i>
<i>enter the tournament this year.</i>

60
00:05:08,476 --> 00:05:11,104
<i>We've made repeated requests</i>
<i>for payments of dues...</i>

61
00:05:11,187 --> 00:05:13,481
<i>... but since you've failed to respond...</i>

62
00:05:13,565 --> 00:05:16,776
<i>... we have to drop the Cobra Kai</i>
<i>from our membership rolls.</i>

63
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:19,988
<i>If you have any questions, give me a call.</i>
<i>Have a nice day.</i>

64
00:05:20,071 --> 00:05:21,865
<i>Mr. Kreese, this is Pacific Bell.</i>

65
00:05:21,948 --> 00:05:26,161
<i>This is the final call regarding your bill,</i>
<i>and if you do not pay immediately...</i>

66
00:05:38,256 --> 00:05:41,885
Mr. Kreese, good morning.
What a surprise. Some coffee?

67
00:05:42,385 --> 00:05:44,554
- Where's the boss?
- He's upstairs.

68
00:05:44,637 --> 00:05:45,889
Thanks.

69
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:26,846
Come on!

70
00:06:35,230 --> 00:06:37,524
You're telegraphing that wheel kick.

71
00:06:39,234 --> 00:06:40,985
Johnny!

72
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:43,363
What a surprise, man!

73
00:06:43,488 --> 00:06:44,614
Yes!

74
00:06:46,491 --> 00:06:48,034
What's this? You moving in?

75
00:06:48,118 --> 00:06:50,745
This is "I give up." I came to say good-bye.

76
00:06:50,829 --> 00:06:53,373
- Here are the <i>dojo</i> keys.
- What are you talking about?

77
00:06:53,456 --> 00:06:55,083
I'll pay you that back rent soon.

78
00:06:55,166 --> 00:06:58,294
You think I bought that place for the rent?
I bought it for you.

79
00:06:58,378 --> 00:06:59,504
- Mr. Silver?
- What?

80
00:06:59,587 --> 00:07:01,131
The plutonium deal.

81
00:07:01,297 --> 00:07:04,509
Johnny, every business has a slump
at one time or another.

82
00:07:04,592 --> 00:07:07,011
Ten years ago
nuclear was the preferred waste.

83
00:07:07,095 --> 00:07:09,931
You could dump it anywhere.
Now, everybody's a detective.

84
00:07:10,014 --> 00:07:12,934
I'm lucky if I make one deal a year
without being indicted.

85
00:07:13,017 --> 00:07:14,060
Thank you.

86
00:07:14,144 --> 00:07:15,353
Let's get some air.

87
00:07:15,437 --> 00:07:18,481
It's been nine months since a student
walked through my doors.

88
00:07:18,565 --> 00:07:21,317
You're not listening to me.
Come on, snap out of it.

89
00:07:21,401 --> 00:07:22,694
I can't.

90
00:07:23,153 --> 00:07:25,572
I'm broke and I'm going nowhere.

91
00:07:26,823 --> 00:07:28,074
You're wrong.

92
00:07:28,783 --> 00:07:30,577
You're going to Tahiti.

93
00:07:30,952 --> 00:07:31,661
Now.

94
00:07:32,412 --> 00:07:34,581
All right, I've made up my mind.

95
00:07:34,664 --> 00:07:37,000
This slope, Miyagi, and that punk kid...

96
00:07:37,083 --> 00:07:39,002
...I'll get them for what they did to you.

97
00:07:39,085 --> 00:07:41,463
They made you suffer,
so I'll make them suffer.

98
00:07:42,589 --> 00:07:46,092
When I think they've suffered enough,
then I start with the pain.

99
00:07:46,176 --> 00:07:49,679
- Terry, you don't have to do that.
- Don't have to? I want to.

100
00:07:49,763 --> 00:07:51,848
It's not over. We're Cobra Kai.

101
00:07:52,265 --> 00:07:54,809
Come on, say it. Cobra Kai.

102
00:07:55,518 --> 00:07:57,854
Say it! Cobra Kai.

103
00:07:57,937 --> 00:08:00,273
- Never dies.
- You bet your ass.

104
00:08:00,356 --> 00:08:02,484
- I owe you, man.
- You don't owe me anything.

105
00:08:02,567 --> 00:08:05,236
I don't owe you anything?
What about Vietnam?

106
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:07,322
How many times did you save my ass?

107
00:08:07,405 --> 00:08:10,158
I don't know. I lost count.

108
00:08:12,327 --> 00:08:14,078
Get the hell out of here.

109
00:08:18,541 --> 00:08:20,335
Have a good trip, Captain.

110
00:08:27,634 --> 00:08:32,347
<i>The White Zone is for the immediate</i>
<i>loading and unloading of passengers only.</i>

111
00:08:33,473 --> 00:08:34,641
Smog.

112
00:08:34,766 --> 00:08:37,060
Smells like home, huh, Mr. Miyagi?

113
00:08:39,145 --> 00:08:42,857
Daniel-<i>san</i>,
why mother not here to meet you?

114
00:08:42,941 --> 00:08:44,901
You tell her right flight number?

115
00:08:44,984 --> 00:08:47,904
I told her the right flight.
I just told her the wrong day.

116
00:08:47,987 --> 00:08:51,366
I told her we were coming in tomorrow.
She loves surprises.

117
00:08:51,825 --> 00:08:52,867
Hope so.

118
00:08:52,951 --> 00:08:57,413
We take taxi apartment house.
Then Miyagi go back to work.

119
00:08:59,082 --> 00:09:01,209
<i>106 Los Angeles. Crank it up!</i>

120
00:09:25,775 --> 00:09:27,652
What are you doing in my cab?

121
00:09:27,735 --> 00:09:31,197
- We just came from the airport.
- I thought that was the cab I ordered.

122
00:09:31,281 --> 00:09:34,159
- Mrs. Milo, what's going on?
- What does it seem? Progress.

123
00:09:34,242 --> 00:09:36,578
I got a message for you from your mother.

124
00:09:36,661 --> 00:09:42,041
I told you that bum would sell the place
and you'd be out of a job someday.

125
00:09:42,125 --> 00:09:43,918
You wouldn't listen to me.

126
00:09:44,002 --> 00:09:45,587
- What's the message?
- What message?

127
00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:49,048
- The one from my mother.
- She said call her at your Uncle Louie's.

128
00:09:50,967 --> 00:09:53,344
No worry nothing, Mrs. LaRusso.

129
00:09:54,721 --> 00:09:57,015
Daniel-<i>san</i> room all finished.

130
00:09:57,474 --> 00:10:01,686
Yeah, I take good care of him.
You just look out Uncle Louie.

131
00:10:01,853 --> 00:10:04,355
I might be here for a few months.

132
00:10:04,522 --> 00:10:08,276
A 70-year-old man gets emphysema,
it's no joke, you know.

133
00:10:08,651 --> 00:10:12,113
Are you sure there's no problem
for him to stay with you?

134
00:10:12,197 --> 00:10:13,615
No problem.

135
00:10:13,782 --> 00:10:14,824
Pleasure.

136
00:10:14,908 --> 00:10:16,534
<i>Mr. Miyagi, thank you.</i>

137
00:10:16,910 --> 00:10:20,413
Welcome. Bye-bye. Here Daniel-<i>san</i>.

138
00:10:20,830 --> 00:10:21,956
Nice mama.

139
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:24,375
You sure you don't need me there?

140
00:10:24,459 --> 00:10:27,462
<i>No. You stay with Mr. Miyagi</i>
<i>and start college.</i>

141
00:10:27,962 --> 00:10:32,133
I can't believe it, "Mr. College Man."
When's registration?

142
00:10:32,217 --> 00:10:34,594
<i>It's this Tuesday.</i>
<i>And classes start Thursday.</i>

143
00:10:34,677 --> 00:10:36,513
And when is Kumiko arriving?

144
00:10:38,473 --> 00:10:39,557
She's not.

145
00:10:39,641 --> 00:10:44,104
She got this great job
with a dance company in Tokyo.

146
00:10:44,229 --> 00:10:46,689
I guess she just couldn't say no, so...

147
00:10:48,108 --> 00:10:49,609
You're disappointed, huh?

148
00:10:50,235 --> 00:10:53,613
Yep. But that's life, I guess.
I'll survive.

149
00:10:53,696 --> 00:10:55,865
You'll do more than just survive.

150
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,868
I gotta go, okay?

151
00:10:58,952 --> 00:11:01,329
Listen, Uncle Louie says hi,
and I love you.

152
00:11:01,412 --> 00:11:04,165
Okay, say hi to Uncle Louie.
I love you, too.

153
00:11:13,383 --> 00:11:15,885
The little maple's still in there.
I'll get it.

154
00:11:15,969 --> 00:11:17,887
No. I go.

155
00:11:59,137 --> 00:12:00,972
Mr. Miyagi, you okay?

156
00:12:08,188 --> 00:12:10,607
Just remembering.

157
00:12:15,069 --> 00:12:17,989
I'll bet there are a lot of memories
here for you.

158
00:12:22,577 --> 00:12:24,662
So what are you going to do now?

159
00:12:28,208 --> 00:12:29,626
Don't know.

160
00:12:31,669 --> 00:12:34,798
Well, did you ever think about
opening a <i>bonsai</i> store?

161
00:12:37,842 --> 00:12:39,511
<i>Hai</i>, Daniel-<i>san</i>.

162
00:12:40,178 --> 00:12:41,638
In my dream.

163
00:12:42,472 --> 00:12:44,015
My retirement.

164
00:12:47,227 --> 00:12:48,895
What do you call this?

165
00:12:55,819 --> 00:12:57,362
Call "time to go."

166
00:13:24,097 --> 00:13:27,308
You know, I've been thinking about
the <i>bonsai</i> shop idea.

167
00:13:27,559 --> 00:13:30,562
You already have all the stock.
How hard can it be?

168
00:13:30,812 --> 00:13:32,689
Not too hard, Daniel-<i>san</i>...

169
00:13:32,981 --> 00:13:37,986
...if Miyagi have money for lease,
deposit, fix-up.

170
00:13:38,903 --> 00:13:42,157
But since we build house
for Yukie in Okinawa...

171
00:13:42,991 --> 00:13:45,326
...money very short supply.

172
00:13:45,410 --> 00:13:46,619
"Supply"?

173
00:13:47,996 --> 00:13:49,539
Supplies are us.

174
00:13:51,958 --> 00:13:55,044
Thank you, Daniel-<i>san</i>,
but that not money.

175
00:13:55,503 --> 00:14:00,091
It looks like money. Smells like money.
Good money. Smell that.

176
00:14:00,341 --> 00:14:02,135
Smell like college education.

177
00:14:02,218 --> 00:14:04,471
I know, Mr. Miyagi,
but I have a great idea...

178
00:14:04,637 --> 00:14:06,055
Daniel-<i>san</i>.

179
00:14:06,514 --> 00:14:07,807
No idea.

180
00:14:09,350 --> 00:14:11,102
Discussion closed.

181
00:14:11,811 --> 00:14:13,605
But what about your dream?

182
00:14:13,688 --> 00:14:17,108
And, Mr. Miyagi, no offence,
but if you miss the train this time...

183
00:14:17,192 --> 00:14:19,944
...there may not be another one
for a long time.

184
00:14:20,028 --> 00:14:21,905
Then Miyagi take bus.

185
00:14:46,471 --> 00:14:49,724
Revenge? Of course you want revenge.
I'm gonna get it for you.

186
00:14:49,808 --> 00:14:53,770
The day you step off the plane, you're
the biggest <i>dojo</i> operator in the valley.

187
00:14:53,853 --> 00:14:55,688
<i>What are you talking about?</i>

188
00:14:55,772 --> 00:14:58,900
I bought 20 locations today.
Yours, 100 percent.

189
00:14:58,983 --> 00:15:02,028
You are back, my man,
bigger and badder than ever.

190
00:15:02,112 --> 00:15:03,947
<i>You're a sweetheart, that's great!</i>

191
00:15:04,239 --> 00:15:06,282
But what about those two jerks?

192
00:15:06,366 --> 00:15:09,828
<i>Those two jerks are taking up</i>
<i>100 percent of my time from now on.</i>

193
00:15:09,911 --> 00:15:12,831
So just have patience.
I'm just getting things rolling.

194
00:15:12,914 --> 00:15:16,918
When I'm finished with that kid,
he'll be begging me to be his teacher.

195
00:15:17,001 --> 00:15:19,045
You know what he's gonna learn from me?

196
00:15:19,129 --> 00:15:24,008
Pain in every part of his body
and fear in every part of his mind.

197
00:15:24,676 --> 00:15:27,345
And here's the kicker:
he's gonna thank me for it.

198
00:15:27,846 --> 00:15:28,972
What about the old man?

199
00:15:29,264 --> 00:15:30,723
Him I hurt for the kid.

200
00:15:30,807 --> 00:15:34,352
By the time that little twerp
steps into the ring to defend his title...

201
00:15:34,436 --> 00:15:37,147
...I'm gonna have him thinking
he's invincible.

202
00:15:37,230 --> 00:15:40,525
Then he's gonna find out
what pain and fear really mean...

203
00:15:40,608 --> 00:15:42,735
...right in front of a thousand people.

204
00:15:43,403 --> 00:15:44,821
How do you know he'll compete?

205
00:15:45,113 --> 00:15:47,866
He'll compete. Don't worry about it.
You just have fun.

206
00:15:47,949 --> 00:15:50,660
<i>Go give Mimona and her girlfriend</i>
<i>a squeeze for me.</i>

207
00:15:50,743 --> 00:15:51,995
How do you know about her?

208
00:15:52,287 --> 00:15:53,538
I know.

209
00:15:55,123 --> 00:15:57,083
<i>Anything else you want?</i>

210
00:15:58,501 --> 00:15:59,753
Yeah.

211
00:16:01,337 --> 00:16:03,465
Make his knuckles bleed.

212
00:16:08,595 --> 00:16:11,765
I like that, Johnny.
I'm gonna use that.

213
00:16:14,184 --> 00:16:17,228
I'm going to be working full-time
on this from now on.

214
00:16:17,312 --> 00:16:18,438
Very good, sir.

215
00:16:18,521 --> 00:16:20,648
No, it's too nice.
I gotta look poor.

216
00:16:20,732 --> 00:16:23,443
This isn't bad. Fix the collar.
Make me look humble.

217
00:16:23,526 --> 00:16:26,571
- About the Borneo call?
- All right, but that's the last one.

218
00:16:26,654 --> 00:16:29,073
For the next few weeks,
my business is revenge.

219
00:16:29,157 --> 00:16:30,909
Everything is in place, sir.

220
00:16:30,992 --> 00:16:33,661
All right,
let's see what you've got for me.

221
00:16:34,287 --> 00:16:35,872
Cute but wrong.

222
00:16:37,081 --> 00:16:38,917
It's got no character.

223
00:16:39,542 --> 00:16:40,627
A truck.

224
00:16:42,629 --> 00:16:45,048
Yeah, I like it. Make sure it runs.

225
00:16:45,131 --> 00:16:46,049
Yes, sir.

226
00:16:46,132 --> 00:16:48,927
- Where are the magazines I ordered?
- Right here, sir.

227
00:16:49,010 --> 00:16:52,472
- Have a very pleasant evening, sir.
- Thank you, Margaret.

228
00:17:20,333 --> 00:17:21,835
"Karate's bad boy.

229
00:17:22,293 --> 00:17:23,503
"Mike Barnes."

230
00:17:31,636 --> 00:17:33,304
Perfect.

231
00:17:42,939 --> 00:17:44,482
Mr. Miyagi, I'm home.

232
00:17:44,899 --> 00:17:47,193
Daniel-<i>san</i>, just in time.

233
00:17:47,902 --> 00:17:49,446
How was fishing?

234
00:17:49,612 --> 00:17:51,364
We find out pretty soon.

235
00:17:52,031 --> 00:17:54,534
So, how first day at college?

236
00:17:54,868 --> 00:17:55,910
College?

237
00:17:56,661 --> 00:17:57,704
College...

238
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:02,667
College is...
Well, you know college, Mr. Miyagi.

239
00:18:03,710 --> 00:18:06,504
It's a place that I didn't go to today.

240
00:18:07,922 --> 00:18:08,965
What?

241
00:18:09,090 --> 00:18:12,802
Mr. Miyagi,
may all your dreams come true.

242
00:18:14,763 --> 00:18:15,930
What this?

243
00:18:16,055 --> 00:18:18,224
There's only one way to find out.

244
00:18:20,852 --> 00:18:22,604
All right, I'll tell you.

245
00:18:22,687 --> 00:18:24,689
It's my college diploma.

246
00:18:24,773 --> 00:18:27,233
- What?
- I'm only joking.

247
00:18:28,276 --> 00:18:30,987
Daniel-<i>san</i>, you have sense humour.

248
00:18:33,198 --> 00:18:34,407
"Lease."

249
00:18:35,450 --> 00:18:38,036
For your new <i>bonsai</i> store.
Congratulations.

250
00:18:38,828 --> 00:18:40,955
"One month security, two month rent."

251
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:44,834
Yes. With just enough left over
for renovations, if we're careful.

252
00:18:46,044 --> 00:18:50,423
Daniel-<i>san</i>, thank you very much,
but cannot accept.

253
00:18:50,882 --> 00:18:53,551
But it's your dream, Mr. Miyagi.
Why not?

254
00:18:54,302 --> 00:18:57,514
Because money in pocket
was not for Miyagi dream.

255
00:18:58,139 --> 00:18:59,808
Was for college education.

256
00:18:59,891 --> 00:19:02,936
I know, just listen to me for a minute.

257
00:19:03,019 --> 00:19:06,606
I know me. I just can't take courses
to take courses.

258
00:19:06,898 --> 00:19:09,359
I'll get bored.
Once it happens, forget about it.

259
00:19:09,442 --> 00:19:11,111
It's bye-bye college.

260
00:19:11,194 --> 00:19:15,365
I've been going to school non-stop
since I'm five. I could use the break.

261
00:19:15,949 --> 00:19:18,076
- I don't know, Daniel-<i>san</i>.
- I do.

262
00:19:18,201 --> 00:19:20,328
- Just come with me a second.
- Where?

263
00:19:20,411 --> 00:19:22,122
- Come with me.
- What about fish?

264
00:19:22,205 --> 00:19:24,666
The fish is not going anyplace.
That fish is dead.

265
00:19:27,794 --> 00:19:29,671
What a moment!

266
00:19:29,796 --> 00:19:33,133
You are now crossing over
to the right side of the tracks.

267
00:19:33,466 --> 00:19:35,677
- What that?
- That's opportunity knocking.

268
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:37,554
Straight ahead. Right up there.

269
00:19:37,637 --> 00:19:40,473
Your dream come true,
and there's plenty of free parking.

270
00:19:40,557 --> 00:19:42,100
Right here, Mr. Miyagi.

271
00:19:42,183 --> 00:19:45,353
- This place?
- This place. Wait till you see it up close.

272
00:19:49,649 --> 00:19:52,569
So, is this the opportunity
of a lifetime or what?

273
00:19:53,403 --> 00:19:55,780
Now, I know you're worried
about this area...

274
00:19:55,864 --> 00:19:59,576
...but the landlord says
this neighbourhood is up and coming.

275
00:19:59,659 --> 00:20:03,746
We're in on the ground floor over here.
Look, a pottery shop across the street.

276
00:20:03,830 --> 00:20:07,041
We could set a deal,
get some planters made up for the <i>bonsai</i>.

277
00:20:07,125 --> 00:20:10,086
Wait till you see inside, man.
This is going to be great.

278
00:20:10,170 --> 00:20:12,088
This is going to be great.

279
00:20:14,632 --> 00:20:15,967
Come on in.

280
00:20:19,387 --> 00:20:22,891
Mr. Miyagi, welcome to your dream.

281
00:20:23,975 --> 00:20:27,145
Now don't let this throw you.
Looks can be deceiving.

282
00:20:27,228 --> 00:20:29,063
We have to think potential here.

283
00:20:29,147 --> 00:20:30,940
Think potential, all right?

284
00:20:31,065 --> 00:20:33,401
You see all this stuff? Everything in here?

285
00:20:33,485 --> 00:20:37,530
You own it. Everything.
It's all yours. You could use this stuff.

286
00:20:37,614 --> 00:20:40,909
This is good wood.
We can make shelves out of this stuff.

287
00:20:40,992 --> 00:20:43,620
Back here,
I thought this would be a great spot...

288
00:20:43,703 --> 00:20:46,414
...up here, to do like a <i>bonsai</i> display.

289
00:20:46,498 --> 00:20:50,085
All those pine trees you have?
We could show them in different stages.

290
00:20:50,168 --> 00:20:52,462
You know, the possibilities are endless.

291
00:20:52,545 --> 00:20:56,007
Over here, right,
I thought this would be a great spot...

292
00:20:56,132 --> 00:20:57,717
...for a little work area.

293
00:20:57,801 --> 00:21:03,431
Over here we got like a <i>bonsai</i> hospital.
The little guys get sick. Take care of them.

294
00:21:03,598 --> 00:21:06,101
I work for free. And I thought of a name.

295
00:21:06,184 --> 00:21:07,393
Check it out.

296
00:21:07,477 --> 00:21:09,729
"Mr. Miyagi's Little Trees."

297
00:21:10,105 --> 00:21:12,440
Simple, direct, catchy.

298
00:21:12,524 --> 00:21:15,235
It doesn't look it now,
but this place is a gold mine.

299
00:21:15,318 --> 00:21:18,947
I know you can make it work, Mr. Miyagi.
If anyone can, you can.

300
00:21:21,699 --> 00:21:24,244
What did I do? Did I forget something?

301
00:21:25,870 --> 00:21:27,580
Well, what did I miss?

302
00:21:27,664 --> 00:21:30,166
Your name on lease, next to mine.

303
00:21:31,668 --> 00:21:33,795
- Partner.
- Partner?

304
00:21:34,754 --> 00:21:37,382
Yes! Mr. Miyagi, this is gonna be great.

305
00:21:50,145 --> 00:21:51,688
You're welcome.

306
00:21:54,691 --> 00:21:55,859
What?

307
00:21:57,068 --> 00:21:58,820
Don't bullshit me.

308
00:21:59,028 --> 00:22:01,114
What do you mean
you can't dump it in Borneo?

309
00:22:01,197 --> 00:22:03,324
Who in Borneo
knows what chloride sludge is?

310
00:22:03,408 --> 00:22:04,576
Just do it!

311
00:22:04,868 --> 00:22:06,077
Do it!

312
00:22:06,327 --> 00:22:08,079
Call me when it's dumped.

313
00:22:08,163 --> 00:22:09,539
Where were we, Margaret?

314
00:22:09,622 --> 00:22:12,751
"And, in conclusion,
I reject your final offer.

315
00:22:12,876 --> 00:22:17,380
"If you proceed,
I'll sue your collective asses accordingly."

316
00:22:17,505 --> 00:22:20,383
Best to Lorna and the kids. Sincerely...

317
00:22:21,342 --> 00:22:22,510
Yeah?

318
00:22:22,844 --> 00:22:24,429
Good, bring him in.

319
00:22:24,512 --> 00:22:25,680
What else?

320
00:22:25,805 --> 00:22:29,225
The grand jury.
What do you intend to do about them?

321
00:22:29,309 --> 00:22:30,894
Bribe them, as usual.

322
00:22:31,603 --> 00:22:33,188
Lighten up, Margaret.

323
00:22:33,354 --> 00:22:35,732
- Who's the DA on the case?
- Mr. Cole.

324
00:22:35,815 --> 00:22:36,900
Good.

325
00:22:37,025 --> 00:22:40,653
Let's invite Willie to dinner Tuesday night.
We'll have his favourite.

326
00:22:40,737 --> 00:22:42,405
- Poached salmon.
- Very well.

327
00:22:42,489 --> 00:22:43,782
Mr. Silver?

328
00:22:44,407 --> 00:22:46,701
You must be Mike Barnes. Welcome to LA.

329
00:22:46,785 --> 00:22:49,078
Thank you for bringing me down,
Mr. Silver.

330
00:22:49,162 --> 00:22:51,080
Milos, call the boys.

331
00:22:51,998 --> 00:22:53,917
This place is intense.

332
00:22:54,042 --> 00:22:56,461
- Consider it home.
- Thanks.

333
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:58,546
Snake, Dennis.

334
00:22:58,630 --> 00:22:59,672
Mike Barnes.

335
00:22:59,756 --> 00:23:03,551
Dennis will take care of your training.
Snake takes care of everything else.

336
00:23:03,635 --> 00:23:07,305
If you're looking to be a bad boy in LA,
Snake's the boy to be bad with.

337
00:23:07,388 --> 00:23:08,765
You know it.

338
00:23:09,641 --> 00:23:12,143
You get a weekly draw and a car.
Any questions?

339
00:23:12,227 --> 00:23:14,562
Remember on the phone you said
if I come here...

340
00:23:14,646 --> 00:23:17,565
...and I beat this LaRusso
in the All Valley Tournament...

341
00:23:17,649 --> 00:23:20,777
...that you'd give me 25 percent ownership
in your new <i>dojo</i>s?

342
00:23:20,985 --> 00:23:23,113
Which I think is more than generous.

343
00:23:23,196 --> 00:23:25,448
But I've been giving it some thought.

344
00:23:25,532 --> 00:23:29,369
For me to do my absolute best,
which is what I want to do for you...

345
00:23:29,494 --> 00:23:31,830
...l'm afraid I'm gonna need 50 percent.

346
00:23:33,623 --> 00:23:35,166
Fifty percent?

347
00:23:36,167 --> 00:23:39,421
Well, I don't know
if I can afford more than 35.

348
00:23:41,381 --> 00:23:44,467
I understand. I guess I'd better get going.

349
00:23:44,551 --> 00:23:46,553
It was nice meeting everybody.

350
00:23:48,179 --> 00:23:51,516
- Do you fight as hard as you negotiate?
- Harder.

351
00:23:51,599 --> 00:23:53,143
You got your 50 percent.

352
00:23:53,226 --> 00:23:56,020
- And I get that in writing?
- By noon today.

353
00:23:56,729 --> 00:24:00,483
You just bought yourself a champion.

354
00:24:00,567 --> 00:24:02,318
You remember that.

355
00:24:03,236 --> 00:24:05,655
- Snake, show him to his room.
- Yes, sir.

356
00:24:06,406 --> 00:24:09,325
See you later, Mike.
Milos, my blue pinstripe.

357
00:24:13,663 --> 00:24:15,457
So, what do you think?

358
00:24:15,540 --> 00:24:17,000
He's obnoxious.

359
00:24:18,168 --> 00:24:19,961
Yeah, he's perfect.

360
00:24:26,593 --> 00:24:29,721
Very good. This make special <i>bonsai</i>.

361
00:24:29,804 --> 00:24:32,223
You really see a <i>bonsai</i> in here?

362
00:24:32,724 --> 00:24:33,725
Where?

363
00:24:33,850 --> 00:24:34,976
Inside.

364
00:24:35,059 --> 00:24:36,311
Inside?

365
00:24:36,478 --> 00:24:38,354
Hello, any <i>bonsai</i> in here?

366
00:24:38,813 --> 00:24:42,442
Daniel-<i>san</i>, not inside. Inside you.

367
00:24:42,525 --> 00:24:45,028
Same place your karate come from.

368
00:24:45,153 --> 00:24:47,113
But my karate comes from you.

369
00:24:48,615 --> 00:24:51,701
Only root karate come from Miyagi.

370
00:24:52,869 --> 00:24:58,041
Just like <i>bonsai</i> choose own way grow.
Because the root is strong.

371
00:24:59,584 --> 00:25:02,879
You choose own way.
Do karate same reason.

372
00:25:03,004 --> 00:25:05,173
Yeah, but I do it your way.

373
00:25:06,091 --> 00:25:08,968
One day you do own way.

374
00:25:15,642 --> 00:25:19,437
Remember what you said before about
<i>bonsai</i> being free to grow as they choose?

375
00:25:19,521 --> 00:25:21,689
All <i>bonsai</i> aren't free to choose.

376
00:25:21,773 --> 00:25:25,527
We tell them how to grow
by using clippers and then the wire.

377
00:25:26,111 --> 00:25:29,614
But, Daniel-<i>san</i>,
our <i>bonsai</i> not true <i>bonsai</i>.

378
00:25:29,864 --> 00:25:33,243
True <i>bonsai</i> grow wild. Very rare.

379
00:25:33,326 --> 00:25:34,786
You ever seen any?

380
00:25:35,370 --> 00:25:36,412
Okinawa.

381
00:25:36,579 --> 00:25:37,956
What about here?

382
00:25:38,039 --> 00:25:39,499
I only know of one.

383
00:25:40,708 --> 00:25:42,585
What did it do, immigrate?

384
00:25:43,503 --> 00:25:47,549
With Miyagi.
Only thing Miyagi bring from Okinawa.

385
00:25:47,757 --> 00:25:49,551
Where's the tree now?

386
00:25:50,677 --> 00:25:51,761
There.

387
00:25:51,886 --> 00:25:53,555
Devil's Caldron.

388
00:25:56,224 --> 00:25:57,600
Devil's Caldron?

389
00:25:58,852 --> 00:26:01,104
No can see <i>bonsai</i> from here.

390
00:26:01,896 --> 00:26:04,983
Good place. Very safe. Nobody bother.

391
00:26:05,066 --> 00:26:07,652
Why did you put it
in such a hard place to get to?

392
00:26:07,735 --> 00:26:10,780
True original <i>bonsai</i>
worth many thousand dollar.

393
00:26:11,364 --> 00:26:14,742
Come, time learn special
Miyagi-family <i>kata</i>.

394
00:26:14,826 --> 00:26:16,202
Now you ready.

395
00:26:16,286 --> 00:26:20,999
Like all <i>bonsai</i> found in tree,
all karate found in this <i>kata</i>.

396
00:26:21,082 --> 00:26:23,585
Come, together we do <i>kata</i>.

397
00:27:48,503 --> 00:27:50,213
Hi, Mr. Miyagi.

398
00:27:50,296 --> 00:27:53,299
I brought this tree,
the one you were working on this morning.

399
00:27:53,383 --> 00:27:55,635
I thought you might want
to give it another try.

400
00:27:55,718 --> 00:27:56,594
Thank you.

401
00:27:56,678 --> 00:27:59,722
A change of scenery
might bring what's inside outside.

402
00:27:59,806 --> 00:28:02,100
- Where should I put it?
- Over here.

403
00:28:02,684 --> 00:28:04,018
Very good.

404
00:28:04,102 --> 00:28:07,522
You've done a lot of work here.
This place is bigger than I thought.

405
00:28:07,605 --> 00:28:10,150
- There's your charcoal.
- Thank you.

406
00:28:11,359 --> 00:28:12,402
Perfect.

407
00:28:14,529 --> 00:28:16,656
I hope you don't mind...

408
00:28:18,116 --> 00:28:20,410
...but I opened that letter.

409
00:28:20,493 --> 00:28:23,538
The one that came today
from the All Valley Tournament.

410
00:28:23,621 --> 00:28:25,665
There's a new rule this year.

411
00:28:26,875 --> 00:28:29,294
- Would you like to read about it?
- No.

412
00:28:29,836 --> 00:28:32,922
That's okay because I got it memorised.
It says:

413
00:28:33,006 --> 00:28:34,466
"Under the new rules...

414
00:28:34,549 --> 00:28:37,886
"...the defending champion
only needs to fight in the final match."

415
00:28:37,969 --> 00:28:41,306
Isn't that great?
That limits my fights to just one.

416
00:28:41,723 --> 00:28:44,809
That's better
than what I had to put up with last year.

417
00:28:44,893 --> 00:28:47,854
And let's face it, it's another year.

418
00:28:47,937 --> 00:28:50,648
It's a year later.
I'm a lot more experienced.

419
00:28:50,982 --> 00:28:54,152
So I think we should
seriously reconsider this.

420
00:28:54,444 --> 00:28:56,362
- Right?
- Wrong!

421
00:28:56,446 --> 00:28:57,655
Wrong?

422
00:28:57,822 --> 00:29:00,867
Should consider get
new pot for <i>bonsai</i>.

423
00:29:01,201 --> 00:29:05,413
I don't know what the big deal is.
I mean, what is your problem with this?

424
00:29:07,957 --> 00:29:11,836
If karate used defend honour,
defend a life...

425
00:29:12,337 --> 00:29:14,672
...karate means something.

426
00:29:15,590 --> 00:29:18,802
If karate used defend plastic metal trophy...

427
00:29:19,719 --> 00:29:22,180
...karate no mean nothing.

428
00:29:24,599 --> 00:29:26,017
Understand?

429
00:29:26,851 --> 00:29:28,103
I wish I did.

430
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:33,858
Go find a nice pot for <i>bonsai</i> across street.

431
00:29:40,490 --> 00:29:41,991
Here's your pen.

432
00:29:42,659 --> 00:29:44,327
Before I forget.

433
00:29:47,122 --> 00:29:51,668
And if you have a minute,
just in case you change your mind...

434
00:29:51,751 --> 00:29:53,336
...here's the application.

435
00:29:53,420 --> 00:29:54,587
Okay?

436
00:29:56,214 --> 00:29:59,175
It's no rush.
I mean, it says at the bottom...

437
00:29:59,259 --> 00:30:02,429
We have a couple of weeks
before we have to send it in.

438
00:30:03,346 --> 00:30:06,808
I'm sorry if I made it seem
like we had to do it today.

439
00:30:08,601 --> 00:30:10,478
We have some time.

440
00:30:25,994 --> 00:30:27,203
Hello?

441
00:30:28,288 --> 00:30:30,457
Hi. Could you turn that off?

442
00:30:30,748 --> 00:30:31,791
Sure.

443
00:30:31,916 --> 00:30:33,168
Thanks.

444
00:30:33,293 --> 00:30:35,712
Hang on, I'm almost finished.

445
00:30:35,795 --> 00:30:36,963
That's okay.

446
00:30:37,088 --> 00:30:39,048
It's okay. Take your time.

447
00:30:40,508 --> 00:30:41,926
That's pretty cool.

448
00:30:42,051 --> 00:30:43,303
Thanks.

449
00:30:43,762 --> 00:30:45,555
So, what can I do for you?

450
00:30:45,638 --> 00:30:48,933
Actually, I was looking to buy some pots.

451
00:30:49,434 --> 00:30:51,102
Yeah, what size?

452
00:30:54,773 --> 00:30:57,317
This would be good. Like this.

453
00:30:57,942 --> 00:31:01,279
They're for <i>bonsai</i> trees.
We're opening a shop across the street.

454
00:31:01,362 --> 00:31:03,406
Great. Welcome to the neighbourhood.

455
00:31:03,490 --> 00:31:04,616
Thanks.

456
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:06,951
Yeah, I love <i>bonsai</i>.

457
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:09,454
They're so perfect, you know?

458
00:31:09,621 --> 00:31:13,124
Maybe when we get our trees in
you could come visit the shop.

459
00:31:13,208 --> 00:31:14,918
And meet my partner, too.

460
00:31:15,001 --> 00:31:17,045
I haven't even really met you yet.

461
00:31:17,128 --> 00:31:18,797
I'm sorry.

462
00:31:19,214 --> 00:31:21,841
- Daniel LaRusso.
- Jessica Andrews. Hi.

463
00:31:21,925 --> 00:31:24,427
Hi. Is that you in that...

464
00:31:24,886 --> 00:31:26,346
Yep, that's me.

465
00:31:26,429 --> 00:31:29,140
What happened to the guy
who lost his head?

466
00:31:30,058 --> 00:31:33,061
Elizabeth Anne Rooney happened to him.
The traitor.

467
00:31:33,311 --> 00:31:34,896
The pots?

468
00:31:34,979 --> 00:31:36,898
You know what we could do?

469
00:31:38,608 --> 00:31:42,195
Could you put like a <i>bonsai</i> tree
on the side of the pot?

470
00:31:42,278 --> 00:31:45,240
- It's sort of like our trademark.
- Like embossed?

471
00:31:45,323 --> 00:31:48,159
Right on the side.
I'll draw a picture of it for you.

472
00:31:48,243 --> 00:31:50,245
That would be great.

473
00:31:50,328 --> 00:31:54,582
- Jessica, come on. I'm late, hurry up.
- Listen, I got to deal with this guy.

474
00:31:55,291 --> 00:31:57,419
Thanks, I'll see you soon then.

475
00:31:57,836 --> 00:31:58,920
How soon?

476
00:31:59,462 --> 00:32:01,756
How soon? Well, I don't know.

477
00:32:02,549 --> 00:32:04,509
- Busy tonight?
- No.

478
00:32:04,592 --> 00:32:05,635
No?

479
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:09,264
Well, then I'll see you tonight.
If that's okay with you?

480
00:32:09,347 --> 00:32:11,015
Okay. About 7:00?

481
00:32:11,224 --> 00:32:13,101
Well, sure. 7:00 is good.

482
00:32:13,184 --> 00:32:16,396
I just live right upstairs,
so go around the side, okay?

483
00:32:16,813 --> 00:32:19,858
- I'll see you around the side, 7:00.
- Bye-bye.

484
00:32:19,941 --> 00:32:22,777
Charles is going to get angry.
Open up the gate.

485
00:32:35,999 --> 00:32:37,500
You found it, huh?

486
00:32:39,377 --> 00:32:40,795
Thanks to you.

487
00:32:40,879 --> 00:32:43,339
Thanks to me? I didn't do anything.

488
00:32:43,506 --> 00:32:45,216
That looks great.

489
00:32:46,509 --> 00:32:48,386
You find something?

490
00:32:48,803 --> 00:32:52,599
Yeah. Yeah, actually I did.
I found a date.

491
00:32:52,682 --> 00:32:55,727
You didn't send me over there
just to look at pots, did you?

492
00:32:55,810 --> 00:32:57,353
Yeah, I knew it.

493
00:33:00,356 --> 00:33:02,275
Did you sign it?

494
00:33:03,693 --> 00:33:05,195
You didn't sign it.

495
00:33:05,612 --> 00:33:06,696
No.

496
00:33:11,201 --> 00:33:15,371
I understand your feelings on this.
But you have to understand mine.

497
00:33:15,455 --> 00:33:17,916
This is the biggest thing
I've ever done in my life.

498
00:33:17,999 --> 00:33:21,127
I'm proud of this title.
Why can't I defend it?

499
00:33:21,461 --> 00:33:23,922
Daniel-<i>san</i>,
you no look answer Miyagi.

500
00:33:24,881 --> 00:33:30,762
Just like a <i>bonsai</i> live inside the tree,
answer live inside of you.

501
00:33:31,930 --> 00:33:35,225
The only thing living inside me right now
is a lot of confusion.

502
00:33:35,308 --> 00:33:37,435
I have the chance
to be the champion again.

503
00:33:37,519 --> 00:33:41,106
- All I have to do is put my signature to it.
- Or match to it.

504
00:33:42,023 --> 00:33:43,441
A match to it?

505
00:33:45,068 --> 00:33:48,029
Then you watch confusion disappear
with the smoke.

506
00:35:32,759 --> 00:35:34,511
"442nd."

507
00:36:55,925 --> 00:36:57,594
What are you doing here?

508
00:36:58,219 --> 00:36:59,929
- Forget something.
- What?

509
00:37:00,346 --> 00:37:03,475
For shop. Bring good luck.

510
00:37:03,933 --> 00:37:06,770
Well, I hope it brings good customers, too.

511
00:37:07,687 --> 00:37:09,564
Daniel-<i>san</i> look good.

512
00:37:09,689 --> 00:37:12,066
Thanks for the shirt. I love it, man.

513
00:37:13,151 --> 00:37:14,402
What doing?

514
00:37:14,527 --> 00:37:19,115
I've been thinking about what you said,
and I decided to take your advice.

515
00:37:19,199 --> 00:37:21,868
I'm going to let my confusion
go up in smoke.

516
00:37:21,951 --> 00:37:23,495
I'm not entering the tournament.

517
00:37:23,578 --> 00:37:26,748
I want my karate and your karate
to mean something.

518
00:37:31,711 --> 00:37:33,671
Good decision, Daniel-<i>san</i>.

519
00:37:34,130 --> 00:37:37,133
This way no more bruises.
Save money on Band-Aid.

520
00:37:37,217 --> 00:37:41,012
Get out of here.
They never laid a hand on me last year.

521
00:37:41,096 --> 00:37:42,972
Just an elbow, a few feet.

522
00:37:43,807 --> 00:37:47,602
I'll never forget that knee to the groin.
That was interesting.

523
00:37:47,894 --> 00:37:49,938
I'll see you later, Mr. Miyagi.

524
00:37:54,275 --> 00:37:56,027
- Hi.
- Hi.

525
00:37:56,111 --> 00:37:57,987
So, you all set to go?

526
00:37:59,948 --> 00:38:02,200
First I gotta tell you this.

527
00:38:05,245 --> 00:38:08,581
After you hear this,
you just might change your mind.

528
00:38:09,124 --> 00:38:11,418
What do you have, poison oak?

529
00:38:11,584 --> 00:38:13,044
A boyfriend.

530
00:38:13,253 --> 00:38:17,799
You see, he was in the headless picture.
You know, we broke up two months ago.

531
00:38:17,924 --> 00:38:20,301
You mean Elizabeth Anne Rooney...

532
00:38:20,427 --> 00:38:25,432
We were both a little dumb about it,
but we've been talking on the phone.

533
00:38:25,515 --> 00:38:28,601
I don't know, we're gonna give it
another try when I go home.

534
00:38:28,685 --> 00:38:31,312
- Where's home?
- Columbus. Ohio.

535
00:38:32,230 --> 00:38:34,816
Yeah, I'm gonna go back
after Thanksgiving.

536
00:38:34,983 --> 00:38:37,485
- I just didn't want to lead you on.
- No.

537
00:38:37,569 --> 00:38:39,237
I did come on kind of strong.

538
00:38:39,404 --> 00:38:42,615
No, don't worry about it. It's refreshing.
We could go Dutch.

539
00:38:42,699 --> 00:38:44,159
That sounds great.

540
00:38:45,326 --> 00:38:47,704
It's just that I've been here
for two months...

541
00:38:47,787 --> 00:38:51,124
...with absolutely nothing to do
and I haven't even met any friends.

542
00:38:51,207 --> 00:38:52,834
Meet your first friend.

543
00:38:52,917 --> 00:38:54,294
All right.

544
00:38:54,377 --> 00:38:55,879
Yeah, this is wild.

545
00:38:55,962 --> 00:38:57,881
Wait till he hears about this one.

546
00:38:57,964 --> 00:38:59,048
Who?

547
00:38:59,132 --> 00:39:02,510
Mr. Miyagi. He's my partner.
You wanna meet him?

548
00:39:02,594 --> 00:39:03,720
Yeah, why not?

549
00:39:03,803 --> 00:39:06,097
You are about to meet the greatest guy.

550
00:39:06,181 --> 00:39:10,226
This guy, he's funny, he's smart.
You got a problem, he's got the answer.

551
00:39:10,310 --> 00:39:11,936
He's like no one you'll ever meet.

552
00:39:12,020 --> 00:39:14,355
On top of that,
he happens to be my best friend.

553
00:39:14,439 --> 00:39:15,815
Why do you call him "mister"?

554
00:39:15,899 --> 00:39:17,025
Mr. Miyagi.

555
00:39:17,609 --> 00:39:20,820
Meet Jessica Andrews from
Columbus, Ohio, and across the street.

556
00:39:20,904 --> 00:39:22,947
This is Mr. Miyagi
from Okinawa and Reseda.

557
00:39:23,031 --> 00:39:24,908
- How do you do?
- Hi.

558
00:39:24,991 --> 00:39:27,994
- Jessica's gonna make those pots for us.
- Very good.

559
00:39:28,077 --> 00:39:30,997
- Welcome to the neighbourhood.
- Thank you very much.

560
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:32,791
How's it going so far? Good?

561
00:39:32,874 --> 00:39:37,003
I never know retirement
mean such hard work.

562
00:39:37,462 --> 00:39:40,381
- You like to see inside shop?
- Yeah, I'd love to.

563
00:39:40,465 --> 00:39:43,009
Partner show you around.
Don't forget lock up.

564
00:39:43,093 --> 00:39:44,260
No, I won't.

565
00:39:44,344 --> 00:39:47,347
- Good night. Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you, too.

566
00:39:47,430 --> 00:39:50,100
- I'll see you later.
- Bye-bye.

567
00:39:51,810 --> 00:39:54,687
- You see why I call him "mister"?
- Yeah. He's nice.

568
00:39:54,771 --> 00:39:56,689
He's the best. Come on in.

569
00:39:59,943 --> 00:40:01,069
What's this?

570
00:40:01,152 --> 00:40:04,489
That's Mr. Miyagi's.
He brought it for good luck.

571
00:40:04,572 --> 00:40:06,699
What do you think?
It is going to be great.

572
00:40:06,783 --> 00:40:09,410
- Yeah, it is.
- It needs a little work, but...

573
00:40:09,494 --> 00:40:10,829
So where'd you meet him?

574
00:40:10,912 --> 00:40:14,207
I met him when I moved out here.
He started teaching me karate.

575
00:40:14,290 --> 00:40:15,542
Karate?

576
00:40:15,708 --> 00:40:17,544
- You do karate?
- Yeah, I do.

577
00:40:18,378 --> 00:40:20,880
He doesn't really look like
the karate-teacher type.

578
00:40:20,964 --> 00:40:22,715
He doesn't act like it either.

579
00:40:22,799 --> 00:40:25,677
Half the time he teaches me stuff,
I don't know what it is.

580
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:26,886
What do you mean?

581
00:40:26,970 --> 00:40:29,514
It's like that vase
you were making this morning.

582
00:40:29,597 --> 00:40:31,975
He'll make a whole karate lesson
out of that.

583
00:40:32,058 --> 00:40:33,601
No, I'm not kidding.

584
00:40:33,685 --> 00:40:36,312
Show me how you were making that...

585
00:40:36,396 --> 00:40:39,607
- You go up and then you go down.
- Okay, now you do that.

586
00:40:39,732 --> 00:40:41,192
Okay, go up.

587
00:40:41,943 --> 00:40:44,529
Now, okay, right, see just like that.
Now go down.

588
00:40:44,612 --> 00:40:47,031
Okay, now do that again. Go up.
I'm a mugger.

589
00:40:47,115 --> 00:40:49,784
I'm gonna grab you,
now grab the back of my head.

590
00:40:49,868 --> 00:40:51,911
Then pull down and bring your knee up.

591
00:40:51,995 --> 00:40:53,455
Room for one more down there?

592
00:40:54,539 --> 00:40:56,374
- What are you doing? We're not open.
- The door was.

593
00:40:56,458 --> 00:40:58,042
I meant for business, pal.

594
00:40:58,126 --> 00:41:01,755
I didn't come here for business.
Came here to talk to you.

595
00:41:01,838 --> 00:41:04,507
We heard you weren't entering
the All Valley this year.

596
00:41:04,591 --> 00:41:06,509
Is that true, Daniel?

597
00:41:06,634 --> 00:41:08,428
- Where'd you hear that?
- Is it true?

598
00:41:08,511 --> 00:41:10,138
Yeah, that's true. So what?

599
00:41:10,221 --> 00:41:13,892
- We'd like you to reconsider.
- Is that why you guys came down here?

600
00:41:13,975 --> 00:41:18,021
- I need your title.
- Then enter the tournament and go for it.

601
00:41:18,104 --> 00:41:20,523
Maybe you didn't hear me.
I need your title.

602
00:41:20,607 --> 00:41:23,109
You don't enter
and that effects my financial future.

603
00:41:23,193 --> 00:41:25,069
I won't let that happen. Get it?

604
00:41:25,153 --> 00:41:27,614
I have nothing to prove.
I have no reason to fight.

605
00:41:27,697 --> 00:41:30,492
I do. I got some money to make.
Give me the application.

606
00:41:30,575 --> 00:41:32,368
Forget it. I'm not going to fight...

607
00:41:32,452 --> 00:41:33,369
Sign it!

608
00:41:38,541 --> 00:41:40,043
You sign it, man!

609
00:41:40,126 --> 00:41:42,504
Come on, man! Right now!

610
00:41:42,670 --> 00:41:43,755
Let's go, punk!

611
00:41:43,838 --> 00:41:46,841
Let LaRusso sleep on it.
Come on. Mike!

612
00:41:46,966 --> 00:41:49,677
Yeah, you sleep on it.

613
00:41:50,011 --> 00:41:53,264
And you can dream about me.

614
00:41:53,973 --> 00:41:55,183
You slimeball.

615
00:41:55,266 --> 00:41:59,020
Slimeball? That's cute.
Did your mother teach you that?

616
00:41:59,145 --> 00:42:00,688
Come on, Mike.

617
00:42:01,397 --> 00:42:05,318
You'll have to excuse him.
He's usually a very mellow guy.

618
00:42:05,735 --> 00:42:06,986
See you later.

619
00:42:08,446 --> 00:42:10,281
Do you know those creeps?

620
00:42:10,865 --> 00:42:11,950
No.

621
00:42:12,325 --> 00:42:14,786
And I wanna keep it that way.

622
00:42:37,809 --> 00:42:39,185
Excuse me.

623
00:42:39,561 --> 00:42:40,979
Mr. Miyagi?

624
00:42:43,273 --> 00:42:45,191
My name is Terry Silver.

625
00:42:45,316 --> 00:42:47,986
My master is Kim San Jang
of South Korea.

626
00:42:48,069 --> 00:42:50,405
My teacher sends his respects.

627
00:42:53,366 --> 00:42:57,495
John Kreese of the Cobra Kai <i>dojo</i>
was our school's number one student.

628
00:42:58,163 --> 00:43:00,498
Word reached us in Korea
only two months ago...

629
00:43:00,582 --> 00:43:03,042
...about what happened last year
at the tournament.

630
00:43:03,126 --> 00:43:07,088
My teacher sends his apologies
for John Kreese's dishonourable actions.

631
00:43:10,467 --> 00:43:12,051
Accept apology.

632
00:43:13,595 --> 00:43:16,389
I was sent here
to help John regain balance.

633
00:43:17,265 --> 00:43:19,434
Hope you can be successful.

634
00:43:19,809 --> 00:43:22,312
Unfortunately, I arrived too late.

635
00:43:23,229 --> 00:43:25,273
I buried John last week.

636
00:43:27,609 --> 00:43:29,194
He's dead? What happened?

637
00:43:29,277 --> 00:43:32,947
His doctor said it was cardiac arrest,
but I knew John better than anyone.

638
00:43:33,031 --> 00:43:34,491
Karate was his life.

639
00:43:34,574 --> 00:43:38,411
And after he lost all his students,
it just broke his heart.

640
00:43:38,912 --> 00:43:42,499
John was a hero.
He wasn't always like what you saw.

641
00:43:42,957 --> 00:43:45,210
He saved my life in Vietnam.

642
00:43:46,252 --> 00:43:48,505
War does something to a man.

643
00:43:50,673 --> 00:43:53,301
You had to have been there
to know what I mean.

644
00:43:53,384 --> 00:43:54,761
Have been.

645
00:43:55,970 --> 00:43:57,388
Do know.

646
00:43:58,306 --> 00:43:59,682
442nd?

647
00:44:01,768 --> 00:44:02,894
Man!

648
00:44:03,311 --> 00:44:05,730
More medals of honour
came out of the 442nd...

649
00:44:05,814 --> 00:44:08,191
...than all World War II put together.

650
00:44:08,274 --> 00:44:10,318
I bet you've been there.

651
00:44:11,194 --> 00:44:13,571
Is this your student? The champion?

652
00:44:13,822 --> 00:44:14,948
Yeah.

653
00:44:15,031 --> 00:44:17,158
Our apologies to you, too.

654
00:44:18,618 --> 00:44:21,496
John had vowed
to come and apologise himself.

655
00:44:21,830 --> 00:44:23,206
He planned...

656
00:44:26,876 --> 00:44:30,130
Look, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry to interrupt your training.

657
00:44:31,548 --> 00:44:33,258
Mr. Silver...

658
00:44:35,135 --> 00:44:37,804
...very sorry to hear about death of friend.

659
00:44:38,847 --> 00:44:40,348
Me, too.

660
00:44:41,891 --> 00:44:43,268
Thank you.

661
00:44:50,692 --> 00:44:52,527
God, that's too bad.

662
00:44:53,903 --> 00:44:55,738
Too bad, Daniel-<i>san</i>.

663
00:44:56,573 --> 00:44:58,575
Come, we continue <i>kata</i>.

664
00:45:13,006 --> 00:45:14,048
Hello?

665
00:45:14,966 --> 00:45:16,760
- Eat yet?
- No, I haven't.

666
00:45:16,843 --> 00:45:20,138
I was supposed to dine with my Aunt Pat.
She owns the shop.

667
00:45:20,221 --> 00:45:25,101
She had to do some things, so I got stuck
with all this macaroni and cheese.

668
00:45:25,185 --> 00:45:28,354
Macaroni and cheese?
You know what I like!

669
00:45:28,438 --> 00:45:30,440
I grew up on macaroni and cheese.

670
00:45:30,523 --> 00:45:33,318
I never say no
when it comes to macaroni and cheese.

671
00:45:33,401 --> 00:45:35,528
- Here, have a seat.
- Thanks.

672
00:45:35,612 --> 00:45:37,864
I used to eat this stuff by the ton.

673
00:45:38,281 --> 00:45:40,700
I want you to try this, okay?
And be honest.

674
00:45:40,784 --> 00:45:41,743
Okay.

675
00:45:45,580 --> 00:45:48,750
On a scale of one to ten, I'd give it as...

676
00:45:50,126 --> 00:45:51,252
...eleven.

677
00:45:51,586 --> 00:45:53,463
Let's eat. I'm starved.

678
00:45:53,755 --> 00:45:55,632
I hope you like this.

679
00:45:55,882 --> 00:45:59,094
I'm not sure if this is
exactly what you wanted, but...

680
00:46:00,220 --> 00:46:02,138
Hey, this came out great.

681
00:46:02,305 --> 00:46:04,849
- Look at the tree. You got it just right.
- Good.

682
00:46:04,933 --> 00:46:08,103
- Wait until Mr. Miyagi sees it.
- Do you think he'll like it?

683
00:46:08,186 --> 00:46:10,188
Like it? He's gonna love it. Here.

684
00:46:10,271 --> 00:46:12,690
- I have something for you.
- For me?

685
00:46:14,234 --> 00:46:15,735
What is this?

686
00:46:17,403 --> 00:46:19,197
The Down Stairs? What is that?

687
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:22,450
It's a dance club. Yeah, it's great.
It's got live music.

688
00:46:22,534 --> 00:46:25,203
It's for the night before you go back home.

689
00:46:25,286 --> 00:46:28,081
I figured it would be
a nice going-away present.

690
00:46:28,206 --> 00:46:30,500
Daniel, that is so sweet.

691
00:46:32,961 --> 00:46:36,423
Come on, guys. This isn't funny anymore.
Come on, turn on the lights.

692
00:46:36,506 --> 00:46:39,717
Danny, I hope you got some good news
for my friend Mike here.

693
00:46:39,801 --> 00:46:41,553
- I hope so too, Daniel.
- I told you.

694
00:46:41,636 --> 00:46:44,347
I can't help you. Forget about it.
Where are you going?

695
00:46:44,431 --> 00:46:46,391
You haven't signed the application yet.

696
00:46:46,474 --> 00:46:48,977
I'm not signing the application.
I won't compete.

697
00:46:49,060 --> 00:46:50,895
Take your friends and get out of here.

698
00:46:50,979 --> 00:46:53,106
Dennis, he didn't sign it yet.

699
00:46:58,903 --> 00:47:01,573
Come on, guys.
This is getting out of hand now.

700
00:47:01,656 --> 00:47:04,451
- I'm not signing the application.
- Sure you are.

701
00:47:04,534 --> 00:47:07,245
I'm not going to be there.
You're wasting your time.

702
00:47:07,328 --> 00:47:08,955
- Take off, all right?
- You take off!

703
00:47:09,038 --> 00:47:11,875
- Come on, Dennis, take him out!
- Put his eye out!

704
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:13,710
Come on!

705
00:47:23,136 --> 00:47:25,513
Come on, punk!
Let's see what you've got!

706
00:47:25,597 --> 00:47:27,140
Nice kick. Not bad.

707
00:47:27,223 --> 00:47:29,434
Better. Good, but not good enough.

708
00:47:32,854 --> 00:47:34,481
Come on, get up!

709
00:47:35,064 --> 00:47:37,066
Why are you being so stubborn?

710
00:47:37,901 --> 00:47:39,110
Don't do that!

711
00:47:42,530 --> 00:47:46,326
I am running out of patience.
Now sign it and let's get on with it.

712
00:47:47,076 --> 00:47:48,453
Stop it!

713
00:47:50,705 --> 00:47:51,998
It's your ass!

714
00:47:52,499 --> 00:47:54,084
Just get out of here!

715
00:47:54,793 --> 00:47:57,504
- Save it for the tournament!
- Nail him!

716
00:47:57,587 --> 00:47:59,923
Mike, come on, let's get out of here!

717
00:48:01,132 --> 00:48:02,634
Come on, old man!

718
00:48:06,179 --> 00:48:07,764
Mike, let's go!

719
00:48:09,224 --> 00:48:11,017
Let's go! You wimp!

720
00:48:13,853 --> 00:48:16,314
I'll be back, LaRusso.
I'm gonna get you.

721
00:48:16,397 --> 00:48:18,358
You're finished!

722
00:48:18,525 --> 00:48:20,860
You can't watch him forever, Buddha-head.

723
00:48:30,745 --> 00:48:32,747
So, Daniel-<i>san</i>, time take Jessica home.

724
00:48:32,831 --> 00:48:34,499
Yeah. Jessica, you all right?

725
00:48:34,582 --> 00:48:36,709
Yeah. I just want to lie down.

726
00:48:50,140 --> 00:48:52,434
I can't believe you're singing.

727
00:48:52,892 --> 00:48:53,852
Forget it.

728
00:48:58,106 --> 00:48:59,649
Feel lucky, Daniel-<i>san</i>.

729
00:48:59,732 --> 00:49:01,776
Lucky? How could you feel lucky?

730
00:49:01,860 --> 00:49:05,488
Feel lucky. <i>Bonsai</i> tree not in shop.
Safe at home.

731
00:49:05,780 --> 00:49:08,950
That makes us real lucky.
I never felt luckier in my life.

732
00:49:09,033 --> 00:49:11,619
Daniel-<i>san</i>, we can rebuild the shop.

733
00:49:11,911 --> 00:49:13,746
Cannot rebuild stock.

734
00:49:16,207 --> 00:49:20,712
We sell a few trees, fix <i>shoji</i> screen,
start over again.

735
00:49:21,671 --> 00:49:25,049
What if those guys come back again?
What are we going to do then?

736
00:49:25,133 --> 00:49:27,552
If they come back,
what are we going to do?

737
00:49:27,635 --> 00:49:30,346
Just tell me,
what do we do if they come back?

738
00:49:35,101 --> 00:49:36,561
Sing happy song.

739
00:49:54,454 --> 00:49:57,165
Where are the trees?
Where'd you put the trees?

740
00:50:00,376 --> 00:50:01,836
They stole them!

741
00:50:03,046 --> 00:50:06,049
I can't believe it. They stole the trees.
Don't they get it?

742
00:50:06,132 --> 00:50:09,886
I'm not going to sign this thing.
Mr. Miyagi, what are we going to do?

743
00:50:09,969 --> 00:50:12,972
- Where are you going?
- Get fishing pole.

744
00:50:13,056 --> 00:50:14,390
What?

745
00:50:15,183 --> 00:50:16,851
Sometimes I don't get you.

746
00:50:16,935 --> 00:50:20,480
The shop's wrecked. We've just been
robbed, and you're going fishing.

747
00:50:20,563 --> 00:50:22,607
We're flat broke and you're going fishing.

748
00:50:22,690 --> 00:50:25,902
You're just going to fluff it off?
Doesn't this even bother you?

749
00:50:25,985 --> 00:50:31,157
Daniel-<i>san</i>, sometime better be bothered
on full stomach than empty one.

750
00:50:31,533 --> 00:50:34,994
Great, another great thought, huh?
That really does me good.

751
00:50:35,078 --> 00:50:38,706
You go fishing.
I'm going to the police to report it.

752
00:50:38,790 --> 00:50:41,668
Show them the application
so they can arrest these jerks.

753
00:50:41,751 --> 00:50:44,838
This is the '80s,
you gotta do something, Mr. Miyagi.

754
00:50:44,921 --> 00:50:47,215
You can't be so damn passive.

755
00:50:47,882 --> 00:50:50,844
Somebody's gotta do something
about these guys.

756
00:51:07,152 --> 00:51:09,904
I bring the tournament application
to the police station.

757
00:51:09,988 --> 00:51:11,906
As I walk in, they start laughing at me.

758
00:51:11,990 --> 00:51:14,742
Finally the sergeant said,
"Son, we'll look into it."

759
00:51:14,826 --> 00:51:16,369
We'll see. I hope.

760
00:51:17,745 --> 00:51:21,291
I still think you should ask Mr. Miyagi
before going after his tree.

761
00:51:21,374 --> 00:51:24,127
He wouldn't have hidden it
in the middle of nowhere...

762
00:51:24,210 --> 00:51:27,297
...if he wanted people to dig it up.
- I don't have a choice.

763
00:51:27,380 --> 00:51:29,799
If he doesn't sell this tree
we're looking for...

764
00:51:29,883 --> 00:51:31,634
...he loses his business. He's broke.

765
00:51:31,718 --> 00:51:34,888
His social security can barely cover
the expenses on his rowboat.

766
00:51:34,971 --> 00:51:37,223
This tree is like money in the bank.

767
00:51:37,307 --> 00:51:39,559
Great. So now we're robbing a bank.

768
00:51:46,316 --> 00:51:48,777
How much do you think
this thing is worth?

769
00:51:48,860 --> 00:51:53,448
I found out these original <i>bonsai</i> trees
start at $10,000.

770
00:51:53,531 --> 00:51:56,659
- Seriously?
- See, that's why it is so important to me.

771
00:51:56,785 --> 00:52:01,456
This one tree can set Mr. Miyagi up for life.
That's the least I could do for him.

772
00:52:04,459 --> 00:52:06,294
It's a long way down there.

773
00:52:07,754 --> 00:52:10,298
- You know what I think?
- What?

774
00:52:10,381 --> 00:52:15,470
I think when the tide comes in,
the ocean fills up the bottom down there.

775
00:52:15,720 --> 00:52:18,056
Yeah, Mr. Miyagi sure knows
how to pick 'em.

776
00:52:18,139 --> 00:52:19,891
Yeah, no kidding.

777
00:52:20,642 --> 00:52:24,187
How are we supposed to find
Mr. Miyagi's tiny little tree in all this?

778
00:52:24,270 --> 00:52:28,108
He told me he put it halfway down
the steepest cliff...

779
00:52:28,191 --> 00:52:30,735
...where it would catch
the first rays of the sun.

780
00:52:30,819 --> 00:52:32,737
Good luck. We're never gonna find it.

781
00:52:32,821 --> 00:52:35,448
- Wait! That must be it! I found it!
- Are you sure?

782
00:52:35,532 --> 00:52:38,493
God, it's beautiful.
It's like the one on the back of my <i>gi</i>.

783
00:52:38,576 --> 00:52:40,120
Come on, let me see.

784
00:52:40,203 --> 00:52:42,997
You see that ridge, where the sun hits...

785
00:52:43,081 --> 00:52:45,458
It's just like the one on the pot I made.

786
00:52:45,542 --> 00:52:47,752
How are we going to get
all the way down there?

787
00:52:47,836 --> 00:52:52,132
You leave that to me. I'll teach you.
Come on. We gotta go get the ropes.

788
00:52:54,175 --> 00:52:57,762
- You sure you understand everything?
- Yeah, I got it.

789
00:52:57,846 --> 00:53:01,808
I feed this through here
and I hold this back here and I pray to God.

790
00:53:02,934 --> 00:53:07,522
Okay. Now, are you sure
you want to do this?

791
00:53:07,814 --> 00:53:09,190
I wanna do this?

792
00:53:09,399 --> 00:53:12,861
- I gotta do it. I'll be okay.
- You got it. You'll be fine.

793
00:53:12,944 --> 00:53:15,905
Remember, the rope is your friend.
Everything will be great.

794
00:53:15,989 --> 00:53:18,283
Friend? This rope's more than my friend.

795
00:53:18,366 --> 00:53:21,744
I love this rope.
This rope and I are going steady.

796
00:53:21,870 --> 00:53:24,539
Right, rope? Just you and me, rope.

797
00:53:26,541 --> 00:53:29,419
Just lean. Okay, you got it. Don't worry.

798
00:53:29,502 --> 00:53:32,172
Just sit back. Just lean back. You got it.

799
00:53:32,964 --> 00:53:34,215
This is almost fun.

800
00:53:34,299 --> 00:53:37,218
I'm coming, okay? Just keep going.

801
00:53:37,302 --> 00:53:39,721
This isn't so hard.
You're a pretty good teacher.

802
00:53:39,804 --> 00:53:41,014
Thanks.

803
00:53:41,139 --> 00:53:43,767
Daniel! Look out! I got you, okay?

804
00:53:43,850 --> 00:53:47,771
- I'm coming! Daniel, are you okay?
- I'm okay.

805
00:53:47,854 --> 00:53:50,565
Hold on! Don't move, I'm coming.
Stay there.

806
00:53:50,690 --> 00:53:54,110
Okay, I got you. I got you.
Put both hands on the rope.

807
00:53:54,194 --> 00:53:58,281
Put your feet against the rocks
and push out. I got you.

808
00:53:58,740 --> 00:54:02,786
Push out! There you go!
All right, I got you.

809
00:54:02,911 --> 00:54:06,206
Okay, now guide your rope.
Slide your hands to the brake.

810
00:54:06,289 --> 00:54:09,375
To the brake. Right here. All right?

811
00:54:10,210 --> 00:54:13,546
You okay?
Listen, I'm so sorry about the rock.

812
00:54:13,630 --> 00:54:16,716
- You sure you're okay?
- No, I'm fine. Don't worry about it.

813
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:19,552
God, it's a lot steeper
than it looks from up there, huh?

814
00:54:19,636 --> 00:54:24,307
- You've done this kinda stuff before, right?
- Yeah, but not from this high up.

815
00:54:25,433 --> 00:54:26,559
Great!

816
00:54:26,643 --> 00:54:28,853
Maybe we should go back.
Do you want to?

817
00:54:28,978 --> 00:54:31,189
No, I gotta keep going.
I don't have a choice.

818
00:54:31,272 --> 00:54:35,318
Well, just be careful, okay?
Watch your footing, there you go.

819
00:54:35,735 --> 00:54:37,987
All right. God, you scared me.

820
00:54:38,071 --> 00:54:39,572
I scared you?

821
00:54:40,198 --> 00:54:42,909
- You can get killed doing this.
- Just think positive.

822
00:54:42,992 --> 00:54:46,037
- How are we going to get back up there?
- Don't worry about it.

823
00:54:46,121 --> 00:54:48,748
You're right. I got enough to worry about.

824
00:54:51,167 --> 00:54:53,586
- What?
- Where's the tree?

825
00:54:53,670 --> 00:54:56,172
It's right there, between the two ropes.

826
00:54:56,548 --> 00:54:57,882
Come on.

827
00:55:09,394 --> 00:55:11,146
It's a beautiful tree.

828
00:55:14,315 --> 00:55:18,111
Mr. Miyagi must have looked like
Spider-Man coming down here, huh?

829
00:55:18,194 --> 00:55:19,654
Yeah, no kidding.

830
00:55:19,737 --> 00:55:21,781
Now, remember how I told you to lock off.

831
00:55:21,865 --> 00:55:24,159
Take the rope
and you put it around your butt.

832
00:55:24,242 --> 00:55:26,578
And you tie it around your leg.
Okay, get it?

833
00:55:26,661 --> 00:55:29,664
- There you go. I got it!
- There you go. You got it.

834
00:55:29,789 --> 00:55:32,459
- All right.
- Now you can use both your hands.

835
00:55:33,418 --> 00:55:34,794
All right.

836
00:55:39,799 --> 00:55:42,260
So he really planted this here, huh?

837
00:55:42,343 --> 00:55:46,055
What, this tree? He brought this
all the way back from Okinawa.

838
00:55:47,474 --> 00:55:51,019
What if he tells you to put it back?

839
00:55:51,478 --> 00:55:52,854
What if he does?

840
00:55:52,979 --> 00:55:56,483
He's not going to tell me to put it back.
Believe me, I know this guy.

841
00:55:56,566 --> 00:55:58,443
That <i>bonsai</i> shop
was his dream come true.

842
00:55:58,526 --> 00:56:02,322
- He won't have me put it back.
- I don't think we should be doing this.

843
00:56:02,405 --> 00:56:06,409
I saw his face when he lost his job.
Believe me, I know what I'm doing.

844
00:56:06,493 --> 00:56:09,037
But what about the tree?
Isn't it going to die?

845
00:56:09,120 --> 00:56:12,999
The tree will be fine. The most important
thing is to pack the roots well.

846
00:56:13,124 --> 00:56:16,169
Believe me, he's taught me everything
about these trees.

847
00:56:16,252 --> 00:56:19,255
- Do you want me to take this for you?
- No, I got it.

848
00:56:19,339 --> 00:56:21,841
All I need is a bag to pack the roots in.

849
00:56:21,925 --> 00:56:24,010
- Daniel! Help me up!
- Hang on!

850
00:56:24,094 --> 00:56:26,930
Don't let go! Grab the rope!
Are you okay?

851
00:56:27,013 --> 00:56:28,389
I got it!

852
00:56:28,556 --> 00:56:31,643
Oh, my God! The tree's in the water!
I gotta get it!

853
00:56:33,603 --> 00:56:35,730
It's gonna get washed out!

854
00:56:35,814 --> 00:56:37,524
Move! Hurry up!

855
00:56:37,774 --> 00:56:39,567
Get out of the way!

856
00:56:40,110 --> 00:56:42,570
I gotta get it!
It's gonna get washed out!

857
00:56:42,654 --> 00:56:45,448
The rope! Hurry!
Get the canteen, quick!

858
00:56:45,782 --> 00:56:48,910
We gotta wash the roots off.
The salt water will kill them!

859
00:56:48,993 --> 00:56:51,663
- Is it gonna be okay?
- Mr. Miyagi will know what to do.

860
00:56:51,746 --> 00:56:54,707
- Just move it!
- I got the canteen. It's ready.

861
00:56:54,791 --> 00:56:57,794
We gotta get out of here!
The tide's coming in!

862
00:56:57,877 --> 00:56:59,963
Wash the roots off. Be careful.

863
00:57:00,255 --> 00:57:02,090
All right, let me have it.

864
00:57:02,215 --> 00:57:04,759
- It's soaked.
- You did good. Put it right in there.

865
00:57:04,843 --> 00:57:07,429
Little fella,
I'll have you home in no time.

866
00:57:07,512 --> 00:57:09,139
No big breaks. We're in good shape.

867
00:57:09,222 --> 00:57:11,433
- I just should have tied off better.
- It's not your fault.

868
00:57:11,516 --> 00:57:12,559
Look, it was my idea to...

869
00:57:14,519 --> 00:57:15,728
The ropes.

870
00:57:18,398 --> 00:57:21,109
LaRusso! How you doing?

871
00:57:21,276 --> 00:57:22,777
Heads up, Danny-boy.

872
00:57:22,861 --> 00:57:24,529
Here's something you forgot.

873
00:57:24,612 --> 00:57:26,781
How'd they get here?

874
00:57:28,074 --> 00:57:30,660
- Hey, this isn't a joke anymore.
- I know.

875
00:57:30,869 --> 00:57:32,370
So let the ropes down.

876
00:57:32,454 --> 00:57:32,662
First sign the application.

877
00:57:32,704 --> 00:57:34,664
First sign the application.

878
00:57:34,956 --> 00:57:36,541
Screw you, man!

879
00:57:37,208 --> 00:57:39,669
See, I think you got it backwards,
buddy-boy.

880
00:57:39,753 --> 00:57:42,046
I'm not the one who's screwed here.

881
00:57:42,338 --> 00:57:46,426
Now I figure the tide's gonna come
in about 12 minutes.

882
00:57:47,427 --> 00:57:49,053
Hope you brought a life raft.

883
00:57:49,137 --> 00:57:51,681
How do we get out of here without a rope?

884
00:57:52,015 --> 00:57:56,144
- Without a rope, we're dead.
- We're dead. Yeah, well, this guy's dead.

885
00:57:56,227 --> 00:58:00,523
You're dead. You want me to sign it?
Fine, I'll sign it.

886
00:58:00,607 --> 00:58:03,318
We'll get in the ring
and we'll see who's laughing then.

887
00:58:03,401 --> 00:58:05,820
We'll see who's smiling.
You're gonna be dead meat.

888
00:58:05,904 --> 00:58:07,280
I hate this guy.

889
00:58:07,906 --> 00:58:09,616
Here. I signed it.

890
00:58:09,699 --> 00:58:12,410
You want it? You work for it.
You pull us up!

891
00:58:12,827 --> 00:58:15,079
All right! We'll send them down.

892
00:58:16,331 --> 00:58:17,582
Let them go.

893
00:58:20,001 --> 00:58:21,544
I never learn.

894
00:58:21,711 --> 00:58:25,131
I should have just signed
the damn thing in the first place.

895
00:58:25,215 --> 00:58:27,509
I should have signed it
and gotten it over with.

896
00:58:27,592 --> 00:58:29,427
You didn't know this would happen.

897
00:58:29,511 --> 00:58:31,513
With this guy, I should have known.

898
00:58:31,596 --> 00:58:33,932
I should have known with that guy.

899
00:58:34,015 --> 00:58:37,018
I should have just signed the damn thing.

900
00:58:37,102 --> 00:58:39,771
We wouldn't be stuck down here.
The tree would be safe.

901
00:58:39,854 --> 00:58:43,441
I'm just such a jackass.
Come on, get us out of here!

902
00:58:43,691 --> 00:58:45,235
Come on, pull!

903
00:59:01,876 --> 00:59:03,711
All right, I got you.

904
00:59:09,259 --> 00:59:11,594
You're one heavy wimp, Daniel.

905
00:59:13,096 --> 00:59:15,390
Come on, don't stop. Keep pulling!

906
00:59:15,473 --> 00:59:17,809
- What are you doing?
- Pull us up.

907
00:59:17,934 --> 00:59:20,019
Leave him there. Get the application.

908
00:59:20,103 --> 00:59:22,856
No, you get the application
when I get up there.

909
00:59:25,316 --> 00:59:27,193
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

910
00:59:27,277 --> 00:59:28,987
All right, here. Just hold us.

911
00:59:29,070 --> 00:59:30,822
- Go get it.
- Here, take it.

912
00:59:33,366 --> 00:59:34,868
Check it out.

913
00:59:35,827 --> 00:59:37,203
It's cool.

914
00:59:37,454 --> 00:59:38,663
That's it.

915
00:59:38,788 --> 00:59:41,374
Don't even think about backing out, man...

916
00:59:41,458 --> 00:59:43,334
...because then I'll really be pissed.

917
00:59:43,418 --> 00:59:46,045
And this, well,
this'll all seem like a happy memory...

918
00:59:46,129 --> 00:59:48,089
...compared to what I'd do to you.

919
00:59:48,173 --> 00:59:50,091
And what we'd all do to her.

920
00:59:50,216 --> 00:59:51,718
Now you're talking.

921
00:59:53,470 --> 00:59:55,805
- Hey!
- Come on! Pull us up!

922
00:59:56,139 --> 00:59:57,390
What, Tarzan?

923
00:59:57,640 --> 00:59:58,808
Pull us up!

924
00:59:59,100 --> 01:00:01,644
- What will you give me?
- I gave you the application.

925
01:00:01,728 --> 01:00:03,605
Yeah, the stakes just went up.

926
01:00:03,688 --> 01:00:05,732
- Give me the tree.
- Daniel, don't!

927
01:00:05,815 --> 01:00:07,609
- No!
- Shut up!

928
01:00:08,193 --> 01:00:09,569
All right.

929
01:00:10,987 --> 01:00:12,947
Just hold us. Don't let go.

930
01:00:15,950 --> 01:00:18,703
Here. Now please be careful with it.

931
01:00:18,995 --> 01:00:20,663
- Please, be careful.
- I will be.

932
01:00:20,747 --> 01:00:24,084
- What are you gonna do with it?
- I'm gonna plant it down there!

933
01:00:24,167 --> 01:00:26,169
- No!
- No, don't, please.

934
01:00:26,252 --> 01:00:28,755
All right, enough. Give me it.

935
01:00:28,838 --> 01:00:31,007
- You want it?
- Just don't throw it over.

936
01:00:31,091 --> 01:00:33,009
Be careful with it, please.

937
01:00:33,093 --> 01:00:34,385
Daniel...

938
01:00:35,220 --> 01:00:36,805
...make a wish.

939
01:00:37,055 --> 01:00:38,139
No!

940
01:00:54,030 --> 01:00:55,448
Mr. Miyagi?

941
01:00:58,868 --> 01:00:59,994
Daniel-<i>san</i>.

942
01:01:00,578 --> 01:01:02,413
The trunk's split. See?

943
01:01:02,956 --> 01:01:07,460
I put the roots in peat moss,
but they got salt water on them...

944
01:01:07,710 --> 01:01:08,878
...and I washed it.

945
01:01:08,962 --> 01:01:12,132
Will you be able to save it?
I didn't mean for this to happen.

946
01:01:12,215 --> 01:01:13,258
I'm sorry.

947
01:01:13,341 --> 01:01:15,635
I just figured maybe we could sell it...

948
01:01:15,718 --> 01:01:17,303
...so we wouldn't have to close.

949
01:01:17,387 --> 01:01:20,306
I didn't want it to be my fault
your dream didn't come true.

950
01:01:20,390 --> 01:01:22,183
Whoever bought it would take good care.

951
01:01:22,267 --> 01:01:23,810
Even better care than yourself.

952
01:01:23,893 --> 01:01:26,271
- Tape. A wide one.
- That's so stupid.

953
01:01:26,354 --> 01:01:29,399
How can someone take care of it
better than where you left it?

954
01:01:29,482 --> 01:01:32,235
- I didn't mean for this to happen.
- Hold.

955
01:01:32,318 --> 01:01:36,239
- I'm sorry. Please forgive me.
- Miyagi forgive you.

956
01:01:36,364 --> 01:01:38,533
You do? I'm such an idiot.

957
01:01:39,033 --> 01:01:41,953
- Is it gonna be okay?
- Depends.

958
01:01:42,162 --> 01:01:44,497
If roots strong, tree survive.

959
01:01:44,706 --> 01:01:46,708
Where do you want these <i>bonsai</i> trees?

960
01:01:46,791 --> 01:01:48,835
Over there on rack, okay. Thank you.

961
01:01:48,918 --> 01:01:50,920
- Trees?
- Peat moss.

962
01:01:51,004 --> 01:01:53,631
Trees? What? What did you do?

963
01:01:53,715 --> 01:01:55,675
Did you buy these?

964
01:01:56,050 --> 01:01:57,427
With what?

965
01:01:58,219 --> 01:01:59,637
Sell truck.

966
01:02:00,138 --> 01:02:01,890
You sold the truck?

967
01:02:05,101 --> 01:02:08,354
Well, why didn't you tell me
that's what you were going to do?

968
01:02:08,438 --> 01:02:10,523
I wake up this morning, you gone.

969
01:02:11,191 --> 01:02:12,442
Damn it!

970
01:02:12,525 --> 01:02:14,319
Why am I so stupid?

971
01:02:15,528 --> 01:02:17,405
No worry, Daniel-<i>san</i>.

972
01:02:17,906 --> 01:02:21,242
Everything work out.
Everything okay now.

973
01:02:21,326 --> 01:02:24,162
Mr. Miyagi,
I signed to fight in the tournament.

974
01:02:32,212 --> 01:02:33,296
Why?

975
01:02:33,379 --> 01:02:36,091
I don't know why.
Because I'm not you, that's why.

976
01:02:36,174 --> 01:02:37,926
I don't always have the right answers.

977
01:02:38,009 --> 01:02:40,261
We were at the bottom.
They pulled the ropes up.

978
01:02:40,345 --> 01:02:41,679
I made a decision on the spot.

979
01:02:41,763 --> 01:02:45,016
It was the wrong one.
What else was I supposed to do?

980
01:02:45,100 --> 01:02:46,518
Understand.

981
01:02:46,935 --> 01:02:48,269
You do?

982
01:02:49,813 --> 01:02:52,107
Listen, Mr. Miyagi,
I gotta be honest with you.

983
01:02:52,190 --> 01:02:55,151
I don't stand a chance against this guy
unless you train me.

984
01:02:55,235 --> 01:02:56,277
Understand.

985
01:02:56,361 --> 01:02:58,863
Well then, you'll train me, right?

986
01:03:00,281 --> 01:03:02,909
Daniel-<i>san</i>, Miyagi always train you.

987
01:03:04,577 --> 01:03:06,830
But for tournament, cannot.

988
01:03:09,124 --> 01:03:10,416
Cannot?

989
01:03:11,459 --> 01:03:13,628
Cannot? What?
What do you mean, cannot?

990
01:03:13,711 --> 01:03:16,172
Mr. Miyagi, why not?

991
01:03:25,890 --> 01:03:28,017
You know what the worst thing was:

992
01:03:28,101 --> 01:03:31,062
When he told me he wouldn't train me
for the tournament.

993
01:03:31,146 --> 01:03:33,273
- Then I knew I was dead.
- What a drag.

994
01:03:33,356 --> 01:03:35,692
Great, let me get some water.
I'm dying of thirst.

995
01:03:35,775 --> 01:03:38,027
- You can't swallow.
- I won't.

996
01:03:38,111 --> 01:03:41,322
You can't keep stopping like this.
You gotta build up your wind.

997
01:03:41,406 --> 01:03:43,575
So bonehead can knock more out of me?

998
01:03:43,658 --> 01:03:45,952
You gotta have more confidence.

999
01:03:46,035 --> 01:03:49,622
- Remember you are the champion.
- Yeah, I'd like to forget it.

1000
01:03:53,501 --> 01:03:55,044
Jessica, this is...

1001
01:03:55,336 --> 01:03:56,504
Hi, there.

1002
01:03:56,629 --> 01:03:58,590
- Sorry, what's your name?
- Terry Silver.

1003
01:03:58,673 --> 01:04:00,759
Terry Silver, this is Jessica Andrews.

1004
01:04:00,842 --> 01:04:03,636
- You training for the Olympics?
- No, it's a tournament.

1005
01:04:03,720 --> 01:04:06,055
The one you won last year?
What's it called?

1006
01:04:06,139 --> 01:04:07,223
The All Valley.

1007
01:04:07,307 --> 01:04:10,268
Right. Good for you.
A champion should defend his title.

1008
01:04:10,351 --> 01:04:12,520
John Kreese told me you had a lot of heart.

1009
01:04:12,604 --> 01:04:14,814
Listen, do you know how to front sweep?

1010
01:04:15,106 --> 01:04:16,441
- Not really.
- Learn.

1011
01:04:16,524 --> 01:04:19,277
Most tournament guys
are suckers for the front sweep.

1012
01:04:19,360 --> 01:04:22,822
You can catch them every time.
Ask your Mr. Miyagi. He'll show you.

1013
01:04:22,906 --> 01:04:25,700
I'm kind of training for this one myself.

1014
01:04:26,493 --> 01:04:28,077
That's too bad.

1015
01:04:28,161 --> 01:04:31,706
I got a good book on sweep techniques.
I'll drop it off for you sometime.

1016
01:04:31,790 --> 01:04:32,957
Great.

1017
01:04:33,082 --> 01:04:35,919
Nice to meet you, Jessica.
Take care of our champion.

1018
01:04:36,002 --> 01:04:38,129
All right, I will. 'Bye.

1019
01:04:39,631 --> 01:04:42,926
That was a nice offer about the book.
Come on, you ready?

1020
01:04:43,009 --> 01:04:44,844
- Let's go. Yes.
- No, I'm pooped.

1021
01:04:44,928 --> 01:04:47,972
- All right, here I come.
- Come on. You're gorgeous. Hurry.

1022
01:04:48,056 --> 01:04:50,767
- Okay, I'm running.
- You gotta get some muscle.

1023
01:04:50,850 --> 01:04:52,310
Oh, man.

1024
01:04:59,692 --> 01:05:01,820
Get out of here! I signed it!

1025
01:05:01,903 --> 01:05:04,531
- Why'd you call the cops?
- Why'd you steal the trees?

1026
01:05:04,614 --> 01:05:05,949
You have no proof.

1027
01:05:06,032 --> 01:05:08,618
Who left the application, the tooth fairy?

1028
01:05:09,494 --> 01:05:10,995
It's your ass, man!

1029
01:05:14,916 --> 01:05:17,168
There's nothing you've got
that I can't counter.

1030
01:05:17,252 --> 01:05:20,130
- Your karate's a joke.
- Let him up, punk!

1031
01:05:20,463 --> 01:05:22,549
- Who are you, his mother?
- Maybe.

1032
01:05:25,385 --> 01:05:26,970
Get up! Get up!

1033
01:05:28,179 --> 01:05:30,390
You see this? You see it?

1034
01:05:33,268 --> 01:05:35,437
Get your hands off me!

1035
01:05:35,520 --> 01:05:38,148
If I see you even on the same street
as this kid...

1036
01:05:38,231 --> 01:05:40,358
...I won't be so charitable with your health.

1037
01:05:40,442 --> 01:05:42,694
- Understand?
- Yes!

1038
01:05:43,194 --> 01:05:45,822
Get the hell out of here.

1039
01:05:45,989 --> 01:05:47,240
Who is that guy?

1040
01:05:47,323 --> 01:05:49,951
- That's the lunatic who wants my title.
- Come on.

1041
01:05:50,034 --> 01:05:53,455
- I was hoping you would kill him.
- That's not what karate's about.

1042
01:05:53,538 --> 01:05:55,457
- It's for defence.
- I know, you're right.

1043
01:05:55,540 --> 01:05:58,001
- Here's your book.
- I brought that for you.

1044
01:05:58,084 --> 01:05:59,627
Right. Thanks.

1045
01:05:59,711 --> 01:06:02,213
There's only so much
you can learn from a book.

1046
01:06:02,297 --> 01:06:03,798
You're telling me.

1047
01:06:04,007 --> 01:06:06,926
Come on, stand up.
Let me show you a couple of moves.

1048
01:06:07,010 --> 01:06:10,764
Help you deal with punks like that.
Make a strong stance.

1049
01:06:11,347 --> 01:06:14,350
Back leg up a little more.
Okay, now sweep me.

1050
01:06:14,434 --> 01:06:18,521
- Well, what do you mean, like that?
- I'm not made of glass. Do it right.

1051
01:06:20,398 --> 01:06:21,483
Better.

1052
01:06:21,566 --> 01:06:24,486
Now a little higher
and at the end twist your hip.

1053
01:06:24,861 --> 01:06:26,613
Keep your hand up.

1054
01:06:30,116 --> 01:06:31,326
Are you okay?

1055
01:06:31,451 --> 01:06:33,912
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry, man.
- That's good.

1056
01:06:33,995 --> 01:06:35,872
That's a strong move.

1057
01:06:36,498 --> 01:06:38,541
Everyone needs a teacher, Daniel.

1058
01:06:38,625 --> 01:06:42,128
I'm opening the Cobra Kai <i>dojo</i> again.
It's time to set things straight.

1059
01:06:42,212 --> 01:06:46,299
Anytime you want to train,
I'll be there for you. No strings attached.

1060
01:06:46,382 --> 01:06:51,137
Thanks. I appreciate that, but...
Listen, thanks for helping me out.

1061
01:06:52,222 --> 01:06:54,724
It's my pleasure.
All right, I'll see you around.

1062
01:06:54,808 --> 01:06:56,267
I'll see you.

1063
01:06:59,395 --> 01:07:00,897
Thanks again.

1064
01:07:13,451 --> 01:07:15,203
- Hi, Jessica.
- Hi, Daniel.

1065
01:07:15,286 --> 01:07:16,704
Hey. Mr. Miyagi.

1066
01:07:17,288 --> 01:07:19,999
Listen, I have a favour to ask of you.

1067
01:07:22,001 --> 01:07:26,881
- Look, Jessica make. Beautiful. You like?
- I stayed up all night firing them.

1068
01:07:26,965 --> 01:07:30,927
I saw one the other night. They're great.
Listen, I have a favour to ask of you.

1069
01:07:31,010 --> 01:07:33,847
I just want to ask you,
do you know how to sweep?

1070
01:07:34,347 --> 01:07:35,682
Of course.

1071
01:07:35,765 --> 01:07:38,685
Would you mind showing me?
I'm not asking you to train me.

1072
01:07:38,768 --> 01:07:40,770
I don't want you to train me. One thing.

1073
01:07:40,854 --> 01:07:43,982
I'd be so appreciative.
All you have to give me is one thing.

1074
01:07:44,065 --> 01:07:48,069
That's it. Please, you gotta do it. Be a pal.

1075
01:07:48,153 --> 01:07:50,530
You wait here. I be right back.

1076
01:07:51,281 --> 01:07:52,657
Where you going?

1077
01:07:53,241 --> 01:07:54,826
Just wait here.

1078
01:07:55,827 --> 01:07:59,080
This is great.
Mr. Miyagi will teach me front sweeps.

1079
01:07:59,164 --> 01:08:03,042
I found out from this guy, tournament guys
are suckers for front sweeps.

1080
01:08:03,126 --> 01:08:05,420
- Really?
- I mean, if I get that down, man, I'm...

1081
01:08:05,503 --> 01:08:09,591
Daniel-<i>san</i>, you hold like this.
First, left sweep...

1082
01:08:09,799 --> 01:08:11,301
It's no joke, all right?

1083
01:08:11,384 --> 01:08:14,053
You don't want to show me,
you don't show me.

1084
01:08:14,179 --> 01:08:16,890
Just don't make fun of me, all right?

1085
01:08:18,224 --> 01:08:21,561
I'm sorry for asking.
Don't worry. It won't happen again.

1086
01:09:10,610 --> 01:09:12,821
- Hey.
- Hi, that was great, man.

1087
01:09:12,904 --> 01:09:14,697
- How you doing?
- Good.

1088
01:09:14,781 --> 01:09:18,660
- Just trying to work the rust out.
- Listen, I gave your offer some thought.

1089
01:09:18,743 --> 01:09:19,744
And?

1090
01:09:19,828 --> 01:09:22,789
If it's not too much trouble,
I'd like to take you up on it.

1091
01:09:22,872 --> 01:09:25,250
I mean,
you know, just on a short-term basis.

1092
01:09:25,333 --> 01:09:28,253
Trouble, are you kidding?
lt'd be an honour.

1093
01:09:28,336 --> 01:09:30,880
How does Mr. Miyagi feel about it?

1094
01:09:32,382 --> 01:09:34,134
Well, Mr. Miyagi...

1095
01:09:36,428 --> 01:09:39,264
...doesn't need to know about it, if...

1096
01:09:40,306 --> 01:09:43,101
- But he knows you're competing?
- He knows that.

1097
01:09:43,184 --> 01:09:45,019
He just doesn't approve.

1098
01:09:47,313 --> 01:09:49,732
Everybody has a right to his opinion.

1099
01:09:49,816 --> 01:09:52,735
- Look, I won't say anything.
- Thanks.

1100
01:09:52,819 --> 01:09:54,904
So, when do you want to start?

1101
01:09:54,988 --> 01:09:57,991
No, I mean, that's up to you.
Whenever it's...

1102
01:09:58,074 --> 01:10:00,785
I got a <i>gi</i> hanging in the closet.
I think it'll fit.

1103
01:10:00,869 --> 01:10:03,037
What do you say we go right now?

1104
01:10:03,121 --> 01:10:04,247
Now?

1105
01:10:04,998 --> 01:10:06,040
One more.

1106
01:10:08,168 --> 01:10:10,962
Good. Catch your breath.
Come on over here.

1107
01:10:11,045 --> 01:10:13,339
You're better than I thought.

1108
01:10:13,590 --> 01:10:16,259
You're ready to move on, Mr. LaRusso.

1109
01:10:16,342 --> 01:10:18,094
You're ready to move on.

1110
01:10:18,178 --> 01:10:20,764
There are three things
that make a champion.

1111
01:10:20,847 --> 01:10:25,268
The three "D"s:
Desire, devotion and discipline.

1112
01:10:25,435 --> 01:10:27,187
The first two I can't give you.

1113
01:10:27,270 --> 01:10:30,315
The last one I can,
but you have to be willing to receive it.

1114
01:10:30,398 --> 01:10:32,233
Are you, Mr. LaRusso?

1115
01:10:32,859 --> 01:10:34,152
Sure.

1116
01:10:35,278 --> 01:10:37,739
The response you're looking for is,
"Yes, sir."

1117
01:10:37,822 --> 01:10:41,201
- Right. Yes, sir. I'm sorry.
- That's okay. Stand up straight.

1118
01:10:41,284 --> 01:10:45,872
Now, over the years I've developed
a system of intensive short-term training...

1119
01:10:45,955 --> 01:10:47,957
...for situations just like this.

1120
01:10:48,041 --> 01:10:50,293
It comes in two parts and has three rules.

1121
01:10:50,376 --> 01:10:53,171
- I call it "Quick Silver."
- That's good.

1122
01:10:54,464 --> 01:10:56,007
You like that, huh?

1123
01:10:56,716 --> 01:10:58,343
Rule Number One:

1124
01:10:58,426 --> 01:11:00,970
A man can't stand, he can't fight.

1125
01:11:01,930 --> 01:11:03,306
Repeat it.

1126
01:11:03,807 --> 01:11:05,600
A man can't stand, he can't fight.

1127
01:11:05,683 --> 01:11:07,852
With conviction, Mr. LaRusso.

1128
01:11:08,144 --> 01:11:11,940
- A man can't stand, he can't fight.
- Good. All right.

1129
01:11:12,774 --> 01:11:16,736
Imagine these two-by-fours are legs.
Sweep them.

1130
01:11:18,947 --> 01:11:20,698
What are you...

1131
01:11:31,793 --> 01:11:33,378
That's too low.

1132
01:11:34,295 --> 01:11:37,549
Any higher it'd be like hitting the knee.
Right?

1133
01:11:37,841 --> 01:11:40,802
Did you come here
to teach or to be taught?

1134
01:11:49,602 --> 01:11:52,230
We're not sweeping floors here. Harder.

1135
01:11:52,981 --> 01:11:56,276
Come on, put your hip into it.
That's where the power is.

1136
01:11:57,610 --> 01:11:59,362
That's it. Harder.

1137
01:12:00,905 --> 01:12:02,157
Harder.

1138
01:12:07,620 --> 01:12:10,748
"Ow" is not an acceptable <i>kiai</i> in this <i>dojo</i>,
Mr. LaRusso.

1139
01:12:10,832 --> 01:12:14,502
Isn't this a little bit extreme, sir?
I mean, come on.

1140
01:12:15,462 --> 01:12:18,757
Extreme situations
require extreme measures.

1141
01:12:36,316 --> 01:12:39,027
Now, you come back tomorrow.
We'll start again.

1142
01:12:43,072 --> 01:12:45,241
You did good for your first day.

1143
01:12:47,577 --> 01:12:48,828
Thanks.

1144
01:12:56,252 --> 01:12:58,213
I really appreciate all your help.

1145
01:12:58,296 --> 01:13:00,423
- Thanks again.
- You're welcome.

1146
01:13:37,752 --> 01:13:39,421
Who is it?

1147
01:13:43,842 --> 01:13:45,885
Why don't you come in?

1148
01:13:48,179 --> 01:13:50,640
Just catching up on some sit-ups here.

1149
01:13:50,807 --> 01:13:53,935
You know, it's not easy
when you're training yourself.

1150
01:13:54,102 --> 01:13:56,646
What happened foot?

1151
01:13:58,690 --> 01:14:00,066
What foot?

1152
01:14:03,570 --> 01:14:05,321
Look at that!

1153
01:14:06,156 --> 01:14:07,615
I don't know.

1154
01:14:08,283 --> 01:14:11,161
Maybe I banged it in my sleep.
I don't remember.

1155
01:14:12,287 --> 01:14:15,081
- What's that?
- You soak foot.

1156
01:14:15,206 --> 01:14:17,000
Be better tomorrow.

1157
01:14:17,083 --> 01:14:22,255
- You got a new foot in there for me?
- No. Next best thing. New foot powder.

1158
01:14:26,384 --> 01:14:29,095
Smells like old foot powder.
What's in there?

1159
01:14:29,220 --> 01:14:32,849
Better you don't know. Give me foot.

1160
01:14:38,563 --> 01:14:40,857
- It's hot!
- Hot, hot...

1161
01:14:42,150 --> 01:14:43,443
Good.

1162
01:14:45,945 --> 01:14:49,491
Maybe tomorrow
you remember what happened foot?

1163
01:14:49,574 --> 01:14:51,159
Then you tell Miyagi.

1164
01:14:51,242 --> 01:14:53,620
Tomorrow? No.

1165
01:14:53,703 --> 01:14:57,749
I have so many things to do tomorrow.
Tomorrow, I'm busy.

1166
01:14:59,542 --> 01:15:03,838
Tomorrow is a bad day.
In the morning, I'm supposed to...

1167
01:15:03,922 --> 01:15:07,759
In the afternoon, I'm meeting with
a buddy of mine I haven't seen since...

1168
01:15:07,842 --> 01:15:10,970
...we got back, you know, from Okinawa.

1169
01:15:16,392 --> 01:15:18,061
What am I doing?

1170
01:15:20,855 --> 01:15:22,524
What am I doing?

1171
01:15:54,055 --> 01:15:56,641
Hope confusion end soon.

1172
01:15:59,811 --> 01:16:02,689
Miyagi heart empty without you.

1173
01:16:07,485 --> 01:16:12,657
The bruise on your foot is gone.
That's good. You're a fast healer.

1174
01:16:13,783 --> 01:16:15,410
All right, let's go.

1175
01:16:16,161 --> 01:16:18,997
That's a nice move.
Mr. Miyagi teach you that?

1176
01:16:19,122 --> 01:16:21,499
- No.
- I didn't think so.

1177
01:16:21,583 --> 01:16:24,878
- What was the last thing he taught you?
- We did <i>kata</i>.

1178
01:16:24,961 --> 01:16:26,755
- <i>Kata</i>?
- Yeah.

1179
01:16:26,880 --> 01:16:30,300
<i>Kata</i> is good for working up a sweat.
It won't win the tournament.

1180
01:16:30,383 --> 01:16:32,510
Come on over here. Hold the bag.

1181
01:16:32,635 --> 01:16:35,680
Rule Number Two
of the "Quick Silver" method:

1182
01:16:35,805 --> 01:16:38,391
A man can't breathe, he can't fight.

1183
01:16:38,767 --> 01:16:40,935
Now, imagine this is the enemy.

1184
01:16:41,060 --> 01:16:43,980
These are his ribs, behind them his lungs.

1185
01:16:47,984 --> 01:16:49,861
- You got it?
- Yeah.

1186
01:16:49,986 --> 01:16:51,654
Good. You try it.

1187
01:16:54,699 --> 01:16:57,035
Wait a minute. Let's do it over here.

1188
01:16:57,160 --> 01:16:59,454
- Where?
- Right here, his ribs.

1189
01:16:59,579 --> 01:17:01,080
Lay into him.

1190
01:17:08,004 --> 01:17:10,632
Why do I have to do this with this thing?

1191
01:17:11,883 --> 01:17:14,177
Because it's part of the training.

1192
01:17:14,385 --> 01:17:17,055
Because I'm teaching you
techniques you don't have.

1193
01:17:17,138 --> 01:17:19,599
Techniques you need
to win the tournament.

1194
01:17:19,682 --> 01:17:22,685
What, do you think you can rely
on that crane crap?

1195
01:17:22,811 --> 01:17:25,188
I did pretty well with it last time.

1196
01:17:27,398 --> 01:17:30,026
Wake up and smell the coffee.

1197
01:17:30,527 --> 01:17:32,987
Last time you weren't fighting this.

1198
01:17:36,366 --> 01:17:38,451
You don't get it, do you?

1199
01:17:40,245 --> 01:17:44,457
If you want to lose because of a little pain,
I can't be a part of that.

1200
01:17:44,541 --> 01:17:47,377
I make wimps into winners,
not the other way around.

1201
01:17:47,460 --> 01:17:49,546
Christ, I'm wasting my time.

1202
01:19:22,806 --> 01:19:23,973
Yeah?

1203
01:19:27,268 --> 01:19:30,021
Damn it! Can you come back later?

1204
01:19:30,105 --> 01:19:32,440
Why are you doing this to yourself?

1205
01:19:32,565 --> 01:19:33,733
Doing what?

1206
01:19:34,025 --> 01:19:35,777
What you doing.

1207
01:19:36,694 --> 01:19:37,946
Because...

1208
01:19:39,572 --> 01:19:43,201
...extreme situations
require extreme measures, okay?

1209
01:19:45,078 --> 01:19:47,497
That not sound like you talking.

1210
01:19:49,165 --> 01:19:51,126
It is me talking, all right?

1211
01:19:51,292 --> 01:19:54,337
I'm sorry if you don't like it,
but I got problems...

1212
01:19:54,421 --> 01:19:57,966
...and if you won't be part of the solution,
don't give me a hard time.

1213
01:19:58,049 --> 01:19:59,676
Okay? You got it?

1214
01:20:32,584 --> 01:20:35,336
What are you wasting your time
with <i>kata</i> for?

1215
01:20:35,462 --> 01:20:38,173
Didn't I tell you
it's useless in a tournament?

1216
01:20:38,256 --> 01:20:41,092
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir. You're right. I'm sorry.

1217
01:20:41,593 --> 01:20:43,678
All right. Come over here.

1218
01:20:43,762 --> 01:20:47,807
Let's get back to learning something
that can do some real damage.

1219
01:20:48,349 --> 01:20:50,018
Rule Number Three:

1220
01:20:50,185 --> 01:20:52,604
A man can't see, he can't fight.

1221
01:20:53,438 --> 01:20:55,315
If you hit him square in the nose...

1222
01:20:55,398 --> 01:20:58,943
...he'll be blinded by his tears
and choke on his own blood.

1223
01:20:59,235 --> 01:21:00,737
Here's how it works.

1224
01:21:00,862 --> 01:21:04,783
You wait until your man is attacking
and when he's close enough...

1225
01:21:05,575 --> 01:21:08,745
But that would be face contact.
I'd be disqualified.

1226
01:21:08,870 --> 01:21:11,915
- He ran into your fist, not your fault, right?
- Right.

1227
01:21:11,998 --> 01:21:14,959
He can't continue. That means you win.

1228
01:21:16,836 --> 01:21:18,755
- You like that?
- I like that.

1229
01:21:18,838 --> 01:21:20,507
Good. Give it a shot.

1230
01:21:23,551 --> 01:21:26,012
Let's try it over here on your friend.

1231
01:21:28,348 --> 01:21:29,891
Reverse punch.

1232
01:21:32,560 --> 01:21:33,937
Visualise.

1233
01:21:34,062 --> 01:21:36,397
This isn't a bunch of sticks
and pipes anymore.

1234
01:21:36,481 --> 01:21:39,484
This is a living fighting machine
that wants to detach...

1235
01:21:39,567 --> 01:21:42,487
...your head from the rest of your body!

1236
01:21:47,617 --> 01:21:49,744
It's blood. So what?

1237
01:21:50,829 --> 01:21:54,249
Make believe it's his.
This guy wants to break you.

1238
01:21:54,499 --> 01:21:58,795
Humiliate you. Stomp you into the ground.
What are you going to do about it?

1239
01:21:58,920 --> 01:22:01,131
- Gonna nail him!
- Then do it.

1240
01:22:05,552 --> 01:22:07,762
- Yes! You did it!
- I did it, man!

1241
01:22:08,346 --> 01:22:09,681
You nailed him!

1242
01:22:10,682 --> 01:22:13,768
- You're ready!
- I'm ready!

1243
01:22:15,645 --> 01:22:18,523
- What new teacher?
- The guy who's been training me.

1244
01:22:18,606 --> 01:22:21,609
You met him. We were jogging
and he pulled up in the car.

1245
01:22:21,693 --> 01:22:23,486
I know who you are talking about.

1246
01:22:23,570 --> 01:22:26,406
He's teaching me stuff
I thought I'd never be able to do.

1247
01:22:26,489 --> 01:22:29,742
- That's what you said about Mr. Miyagi.
- But this guy's different.

1248
01:22:29,826 --> 01:22:32,328
- How do you mean "different"?
- I'll show you sometime.

1249
01:22:32,412 --> 01:22:35,415
- Come on, let's rock 'n' roll.
- All right, let's do it.

1250
01:22:35,498 --> 01:22:37,167
What are you looking at?

1251
01:22:37,250 --> 01:22:39,961
What are you doing
looking at other guys like that for?

1252
01:22:40,044 --> 01:22:41,629
I don't play that.

1253
01:22:41,713 --> 01:22:43,631
- I got some nerve?
- You got some nerve...

1254
01:22:43,715 --> 01:22:45,425
What about you?

1255
01:22:45,550 --> 01:22:48,219
- No, you get...
- Get out of my way, white boy!

1256
01:23:25,924 --> 01:23:28,343
If I don't get something to drink,
I'm gonna die.

1257
01:23:28,426 --> 01:23:30,512
Tell me. I could drink a horse.

1258
01:23:30,637 --> 01:23:34,390
- Mr. Silver, what are you doing here?
- You told me you'd be here, remember?

1259
01:23:34,474 --> 01:23:36,893
- Hold up, sexy lady.
- Who's your friend?

1260
01:23:36,976 --> 01:23:40,230
- I've been watching you and you are hot.
- She's with me, man.

1261
01:23:40,313 --> 01:23:42,232
- Says who?
- Says me.

1262
01:23:42,941 --> 01:23:44,692
I'm taking her home.

1263
01:23:47,821 --> 01:23:51,324
What are you doing?
What is wrong with you?

1264
01:23:51,407 --> 01:23:52,826
What, are you nuts?

1265
01:23:52,951 --> 01:23:55,912
Come on. We gotta get out of here!

1266
01:23:56,037 --> 01:23:57,455
Up you go.

1267
01:23:57,580 --> 01:24:00,708
- What happened?
- He broke my nose, man.

1268
01:24:00,792 --> 01:24:02,836
Where's that guy with my money?

1269
01:24:02,919 --> 01:24:05,296
Get out of the way!

1270
01:24:06,506 --> 01:24:09,592
Man, that was beautiful.
You didn't even think.

1271
01:24:09,676 --> 01:24:11,845
Something got in your way, bang!
Down it went!

1272
01:24:11,928 --> 01:24:13,471
I gotta go back in there.

1273
01:24:13,555 --> 01:24:16,433
- What are you saying?
- I gotta check that guy out.

1274
01:24:16,558 --> 01:24:19,227
Technique and killer instinct.
You got it all now, kid.

1275
01:24:19,310 --> 01:24:21,646
- No, I gotta get out of here.
- Where you going?

1276
01:24:21,729 --> 01:24:25,191
What's wrong? You did the right thing.
You had no choice.

1277
01:24:30,447 --> 01:24:31,781
Who is it?

1278
01:24:31,906 --> 01:24:33,783
It's me, it's Daniel.

1279
01:24:40,081 --> 01:24:41,166
What do you want?

1280
01:24:41,291 --> 01:24:42,959
- Can I talk to you?
- I'm busy.

1281
01:24:43,042 --> 01:24:45,295
Just give me a minute. Please.

1282
01:24:50,550 --> 01:24:53,553
I want to apologise for tonight.
It shouldn't have happened.

1283
01:24:53,636 --> 01:24:56,473
You should tell that to the guy
whose nose you broke.

1284
01:24:56,556 --> 01:24:58,516
I am. I will.

1285
01:24:58,892 --> 01:25:01,394
I just didn't want you leaving
thinking that was me.

1286
01:25:01,478 --> 01:25:02,937
It wasn't you?

1287
01:25:03,146 --> 01:25:05,648
Then who was it? Conan the Barbarian?

1288
01:25:05,774 --> 01:25:08,860
I've been trying to be someone I'm not
and it's not working.

1289
01:25:08,943 --> 01:25:11,821
I feel like I'm losing control of everything.

1290
01:25:12,113 --> 01:25:15,408
The only thing I see you losing control of
is your temper.

1291
01:25:15,492 --> 01:25:18,286
Well, and your friendship
and Mr. Miyagi's trust.

1292
01:25:18,369 --> 01:25:20,538
I've lost everything.
I don't know what to do.

1293
01:25:20,622 --> 01:25:23,041
I've wrecked everything with Mr. Miyagi.

1294
01:25:23,124 --> 01:25:27,087
I know he's written me off.
And I can't blame him. I don't blame him.

1295
01:25:27,253 --> 01:25:29,881
I don't know what the hell I'm going to do.

1296
01:25:41,226 --> 01:25:43,269
Nobody's written you off.

1297
01:25:43,770 --> 01:25:48,483
Just because I got upset
doesn't mean I'm not your friend anymore.

1298
01:25:48,858 --> 01:25:52,946
Mr. Miyagi, he loves you.
He has faith in you. He told me that.

1299
01:25:53,029 --> 01:25:57,033
Let's see how much faith he has
when he hears about what I did tonight.

1300
01:25:57,158 --> 01:26:01,704
- I think he should hear it from you first.
- It's too late. I blew it. It's blown.

1301
01:26:01,788 --> 01:26:04,541
You're gonna blow,
unless you do something about it now.

1302
01:26:04,624 --> 01:26:09,587
I know, you're right. It's easy to say.
It's just, I don't know if I could face him.

1303
01:26:15,218 --> 01:26:16,970
You'll do fine.

1304
01:26:17,554 --> 01:26:20,223
You just gotta do it.

1305
01:26:23,184 --> 01:26:25,854
Well, I don't know if I can.

1306
01:26:35,155 --> 01:26:37,115
I'm gonna miss you.

1307
01:26:37,907 --> 01:26:40,368
Send me a Christmas card, okay?

1308
01:26:41,077 --> 01:26:43,163
You got a deal.

1309
01:26:43,955 --> 01:26:45,623
- 'Bye.
- 'Bye.

1310
01:26:51,588 --> 01:26:52,756
Thanks.

1311
01:26:53,423 --> 01:26:54,716
Anytime.

1312
01:26:58,928 --> 01:27:02,223
I just told the other nurse
that I don't know his name.

1313
01:27:02,348 --> 01:27:05,018
I'm the guy who broke his nose.
I need to talk to him.

1314
01:27:05,101 --> 01:27:08,021
I need to tell him I'm sorry
and that I want to pay for it.

1315
01:27:08,104 --> 01:27:10,899
Please, let me speak with him.

1316
01:27:12,066 --> 01:27:16,613
No, I can't wait until tomorrow, all right.
I gotta talk to him now, damn it!

1317
01:27:16,738 --> 01:27:20,700
All right. I'm sorry, okay?
I don't mean to be rude, I'm...

1318
01:27:21,242 --> 01:27:22,994
Hello, miss?

1319
01:27:28,708 --> 01:27:30,627
Look at this.

1320
01:27:30,710 --> 01:27:34,297
Look at my sweatshirt.
I got some poor guy's blood all over me.

1321
01:27:34,422 --> 01:27:36,925
Everything you taught me,
I did the opposite.

1322
01:27:37,008 --> 01:27:40,053
I couldn't have been worse.
I did everything wrong.

1323
01:27:40,136 --> 01:27:43,515
I just feel like your tree.
You know, the one that I wrecked.

1324
01:27:43,598 --> 01:27:46,351
I feel just like that.
I feel like I'm falling apart.

1325
01:27:46,434 --> 01:27:47,852
Miyagi show you something.

1326
01:27:47,936 --> 01:27:50,563
I feel like the whole world
is coming down on me.

1327
01:27:50,647 --> 01:27:53,525
It's all my fault. I did it myself.

1328
01:27:53,650 --> 01:27:57,112
Everything can heal. Just take time.

1329
01:27:57,195 --> 01:27:58,571
Take patience.

1330
01:27:58,696 --> 01:28:03,660
I'm sorry. When I started out
I never meant for it to end the way it did.

1331
01:28:04,160 --> 01:28:07,330
Sometime when take trip,
better know where trip end.

1332
01:28:07,747 --> 01:28:10,166
Otherwise better just stay home.

1333
01:28:13,002 --> 01:28:15,130
It's budding.

1334
01:28:15,255 --> 01:28:17,715
Look at that, it's gonna make it.

1335
01:28:19,467 --> 01:28:22,220
Make it because have strong root.

1336
01:28:23,346 --> 01:28:25,432
Just like you, Daniel-<i>san</i>.

1337
01:28:26,516 --> 01:28:28,768
Inside you have strong root.

1338
01:28:29,477 --> 01:28:33,481
No need nothing
except what inside you to grow.

1339
01:28:35,942 --> 01:28:37,735
Understand?

1340
01:28:41,698 --> 01:28:43,158
I do understand.

1341
01:28:47,245 --> 01:28:48,955
You're right.

1342
01:28:49,581 --> 01:28:53,209
I gotta go. I'll be right back.
I'll just be a little while.

1343
01:28:53,334 --> 01:28:54,586
Where going?

1344
01:28:54,711 --> 01:28:58,506
You remember that guy, Terry Silver?
He's the one that's been training me.

1345
01:28:58,590 --> 01:29:01,676
He meant well,
but I want to tell him it's over.

1346
01:29:01,760 --> 01:29:06,723
- It not wait for tomorrow?
- I'll feel better if I get it over with now.

1347
01:29:06,806 --> 01:29:08,516
You like Miyagi come help you?

1348
01:29:08,600 --> 01:29:12,645
No, I did it myself.
I'll get out of it myself, all right?

1349
01:29:12,771 --> 01:29:15,064
I'll be back in a little while.

1350
01:29:32,165 --> 01:29:33,374
Hello.

1351
01:29:38,463 --> 01:29:39,964
Mr. Silver?

1352
01:29:49,099 --> 01:29:50,308
Hello?

1353
01:29:53,311 --> 01:29:54,604
Hello?

1354
01:29:57,190 --> 01:29:58,358
Mr. Silver?

1355
01:29:59,192 --> 01:30:00,318
Hey.

1356
01:30:01,486 --> 01:30:03,279
- Hi.
- Here you are.

1357
01:30:03,363 --> 01:30:07,784
- Where'd you go?
- I had to go think about some things.

1358
01:30:07,951 --> 01:30:09,577
- And...
- And?

1359
01:30:10,078 --> 01:30:13,456
And I've...
Listen, I've decided not to defend my title.

1360
01:30:14,040 --> 01:30:16,960
I really appreciate
everything you've done for me.

1361
01:30:17,085 --> 01:30:19,462
I mean, you've been great. I just...

1362
01:30:19,796 --> 01:30:23,174
You know, when I hit that guy,
that's just not me.

1363
01:30:23,341 --> 01:30:26,177
I just wanted to come here
and tell you in person...

1364
01:30:26,261 --> 01:30:29,389
...'cause I figured after everything,
I owed you at least that.

1365
01:30:29,472 --> 01:30:31,599
You owe me a lot more than that,
Danny-boy.

1366
01:30:31,683 --> 01:30:34,436
I'm sorry.
I thought the lessons were free, but...

1367
01:30:34,519 --> 01:30:36,604
No. Nothing's for free.

1368
01:30:37,480 --> 01:30:39,315
You are going to defend.

1369
01:30:39,732 --> 01:30:41,818
You're getting in that ring.

1370
01:30:41,943 --> 01:30:43,403
Excuse me, Mr. Silver...

1371
01:30:43,486 --> 01:30:46,614
...you can't make me do something
I don't want to do.

1372
01:30:51,870 --> 01:30:53,246
Danny.

1373
01:30:54,581 --> 01:30:58,293
Since you met me, I've made you do things
you didn't want to do.

1374
01:30:58,418 --> 01:31:00,003
What are you talking about?

1375
01:31:00,086 --> 01:31:02,130
- What am I talking about?
- Yeah, what?

1376
01:31:02,255 --> 01:31:04,632
Let's show him what I'm talking about.

1377
01:31:07,218 --> 01:31:09,929
I'm what he's talking about, shithead.

1378
01:31:11,055 --> 01:31:14,350
- We have a simple agenda here.
- You're crazy.

1379
01:31:14,434 --> 01:31:18,146
Either you fight one fight
or fight for the rest of your life.

1380
01:31:18,229 --> 01:31:20,190
- You're sick!
- What's it gonna be?

1381
01:31:20,273 --> 01:31:24,110
I'm not gonna be there.
So just forget about it, all right?

1382
01:31:28,114 --> 01:31:31,242
Let's show Mr. Kreese
how he's going to get his business back.

1383
01:31:31,326 --> 01:31:33,661
- I won't fight.
- You don't have to.

1384
01:31:33,745 --> 01:31:36,539
You can just stand there
and let him kick your ass.

1385
01:31:40,835 --> 01:31:44,380
- Do the crane, Danny-boy!
- You're doing this to yourself, man.

1386
01:31:45,256 --> 01:31:47,092
Yes!

1387
01:31:49,385 --> 01:31:52,013
- You wanna see some more?
- I wanna see a lot more.

1388
01:31:52,097 --> 01:31:53,681
Bring him back.

1389
01:31:54,307 --> 01:31:55,809
You see his face?

1390
01:31:56,309 --> 01:31:59,020
See the trail? I think he peed in his pants!

1391
01:32:12,951 --> 01:32:16,329
Well, look who's here. The big war hero.

1392
01:32:19,541 --> 01:32:21,292
What are you waiting for?

1393
01:32:29,008 --> 01:32:30,468
Party time.

1394
01:32:34,973 --> 01:32:36,683
We're old friends.

1395
01:33:01,124 --> 01:33:02,917
Come on, little man.

1396
01:33:03,001 --> 01:33:05,545
Let's see how good you really are.

1397
01:33:47,837 --> 01:33:50,048
You think this is the end of it, old man?

1398
01:33:50,131 --> 01:33:53,093
I'm going to open Cobra Kai <i>dojo</i>s
all over this valley.

1399
01:33:53,176 --> 01:33:55,553
Hell, I might even teach for free.

1400
01:33:55,720 --> 01:33:58,181
From now on when people say
karate around here...

1401
01:33:58,264 --> 01:34:00,517
...all they'll mean is Cobra Kai karate.

1402
01:34:00,600 --> 01:34:04,020
John Kreese's karate.
You won't even be a memory.

1403
01:34:04,104 --> 01:34:06,856
Yes, he will. You won't.

1404
01:34:10,151 --> 01:34:12,195
Now will you train me?

1405
01:34:18,910 --> 01:34:20,954
Now Miyagi train you.

1406
01:34:23,873 --> 01:34:26,000
Come. Waste time here.

1407
01:36:09,729 --> 01:36:11,439
We plant tree here.

1408
01:36:12,065 --> 01:36:14,025
- You take tree.
- All set.

1409
01:36:14,192 --> 01:36:16,194
- Careful.
- I got it.

1410
01:36:16,277 --> 01:36:19,948
Happy to be home, old fella? Yeah, I bet.

1411
01:36:20,573 --> 01:36:23,618
Let's get this crummy plastic bag off you.

1412
01:36:23,743 --> 01:36:25,787
Put you back where you belong.

1413
01:36:27,122 --> 01:36:28,623
There you go.

1414
01:36:28,873 --> 01:36:30,917
Nice comfortable spot.

1415
01:36:31,042 --> 01:36:34,295
- That feel good?
- Good spot, Daniel-<i>san</i>.

1416
01:36:35,672 --> 01:36:38,925
I got just what you need.
A nice cool drink.

1417
01:36:41,511 --> 01:36:44,264
Let some of your old roots soak that up.

1418
01:36:44,722 --> 01:36:48,601
Daniel-<i>san</i>, this <i>bonsai</i> have strong root.

1419
01:36:49,185 --> 01:36:50,770
Same you.

1420
01:36:51,604 --> 01:36:54,357
This tree now choose how it grow.

1421
01:36:55,316 --> 01:36:57,735
So must you choose how you grow.

1422
01:37:00,864 --> 01:37:03,491
Miyagi have great faith in you.

1423
01:37:04,784 --> 01:37:06,536
Understand?

1424
01:37:33,354 --> 01:37:35,231
Come on, Daniel-<i>san</i>.

1425
01:37:55,418 --> 01:37:57,545
See you around, old fella.

1426
01:38:11,851 --> 01:38:13,436
<i>Point Barnes!</i>

1427
01:38:13,561 --> 01:38:16,314
<i>The score is 2-0.</i>

1428
01:38:16,689 --> 01:38:19,442
- Let's do it up, do it right!
- Ready? Begin!

1429
01:38:22,028 --> 01:38:24,906
- Did you teach him that?
- No, that one is his.

1430
01:38:25,782 --> 01:38:28,993
A warning for a kick to the groin.
Once more, costs you a point.

1431
01:38:29,077 --> 01:38:31,830
Fighting positions. Ready? Begin!

1432
01:38:34,624 --> 01:38:36,459
<i>Three points for Barnes.</i>

1433
01:38:36,543 --> 01:38:39,462
- Danny-boy's gonna get murdered up there.
- Winner!

1434
01:38:39,671 --> 01:38:41,381
Face me. Bow.

1435
01:38:41,464 --> 01:38:42,924
Shake hands.

1436
01:38:43,341 --> 01:38:45,468
You're next, LaRusso. I own your ass.

1437
01:38:45,552 --> 01:38:48,304
<i>While we wait for the challenger</i>
<i>to catch his breath...</i>

1438
01:38:48,388 --> 01:38:50,682
T-shirts! Get your Cobra Kai T-shirts!

1439
01:38:50,974 --> 01:38:55,019
<i>... I'd like to thank a new patron of ours</i>
<i>for the purchase and donation...</i>

1440
01:38:55,103 --> 01:38:58,398
<i>... of the permanent home</i>
<i>of the All Valley Championships.</i>

1441
01:38:58,481 --> 01:39:03,945
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, the president</i>
<i>of Dyna-tox Industries, Mr. Terry Silver.</i>

1442
01:39:04,028 --> 01:39:05,864
Yeah, Mr. Silver!

1443
01:39:09,200 --> 01:39:10,577
<i>Thank you, John.</i>

1444
01:39:10,994 --> 01:39:12,620
<i>Thank you very much.</i>

1445
01:39:12,954 --> 01:39:17,625
<i>I've always lived my life by the rule:</i>
<i>"If you get, you give."</i>

1446
01:39:18,877 --> 01:39:22,172
<i>For the last 20 years,</i>
<i>I've gotten from karate.</i>

1447
01:39:22,881 --> 01:39:25,049
<i>I've gotten discipline...</i>

1448
01:39:25,175 --> 01:39:28,178
<i>... health, self-confidence...</i>

1449
01:39:28,261 --> 01:39:29,846
<i>... inner peace.</i>

1450
01:39:30,013 --> 01:39:32,682
<i>Everything that makes me</i>
<i>what I am today.</i>

1451
01:39:33,016 --> 01:39:36,561
<i>And today, it's time for me to give back.</i>

1452
01:39:39,606 --> 01:39:43,276
<i>It's my pleasure to announce</i>
<i>my partnership with the greatest...</i>

1453
01:39:43,401 --> 01:39:47,447
<i>... karate man I have ever known,</i>
Sensei <i>John Kreese.</i>

1454
01:39:47,614 --> 01:39:49,908
Yeah, Mr. Kreese.

1455
01:39:55,997 --> 01:39:59,793
<i>Together, we are about to open</i>
<i>a chain of Cobra Kai</i> dojo<i>s...</i>

1456
01:39:59,959 --> 01:40:05,048
<i>... where young people can come</i>
<i>and learn the same values I've learned:</i>

1457
01:40:06,591 --> 01:40:07,926
<i>Honesty...</i>

1458
01:40:08,843 --> 01:40:10,512
<i>... compassion...</i>

1459
01:40:11,179 --> 01:40:12,931
<i>... and fair play.</i>

1460
01:40:13,556 --> 01:40:17,393
<i>Thank you all for coming.</i>
<i>Enjoy the final match.</i>

1461
01:40:17,894 --> 01:40:19,687
<i>Thank you, Mr. Silver.</i>

1462
01:40:22,065 --> 01:40:26,277
<i>And thank you again</i>
<i>for your most generous contribution.</i>

1463
01:40:26,361 --> 01:40:28,071
Remember the game plan.

1464
01:40:28,196 --> 01:40:30,615
First you win a point,
then you lose a point.

1465
01:40:30,698 --> 01:40:34,452
Keep the score 0-0.
Pulverise him for the full three minutes.

1466
01:40:34,536 --> 01:40:37,497
Then in sudden death,
you get the point, we win.

1467
01:40:37,580 --> 01:40:39,833
I want him to experience pain.

1468
01:40:39,916 --> 01:40:42,627
- First he suffers.
- Then he suffers some more.

1469
01:40:42,752 --> 01:40:47,298
<i>Representing the Cobra Kai,</i>
<i>the challenger, Mike Barnes.</i>

1470
01:40:50,760 --> 01:40:54,597
<i>And in this corner,</i>
<i>someone who needs no introduction...</i>

1471
01:40:54,681 --> 01:40:58,101
<i>... the defending champion</i>
<i>from the Miyagi</i> dojo...

1472
01:40:58,268 --> 01:41:00,311
<i>... Daniel LaRusso.</i>

1473
01:41:16,453 --> 01:41:19,038
<i>This match will have</i>
<i>a three-minute time limit.</i>

1474
01:41:19,122 --> 01:41:23,543
<i>The first fighter to score three points</i>
<i>will be designated this year's...</i>

1475
01:41:23,668 --> 01:41:26,171
<i>... All Valley Under-18 Champion.</i>

1476
01:41:26,254 --> 01:41:28,882
- <i>Fighters to your marks!</i>
- Go out there and get him.

1477
01:41:28,965 --> 01:41:30,675
Flatten him out, Mike. Fight him!

1478
01:41:30,759 --> 01:41:36,181
<i>Remember, folks, the new rule this year</i>
<i>states that if there is no winner...</i>

1479
01:41:36,264 --> 01:41:40,477
<i>... at the end of three minutes</i>
<i>the championship match will go...</i>

1480
01:41:40,560 --> 01:41:42,771
<i>... into sudden-death overtime.</i>

1481
01:41:42,854 --> 01:41:45,190
When it's over,
his mother won't recognise him.

1482
01:41:45,273 --> 01:41:46,399
You both know the rules.

1483
01:41:46,483 --> 01:41:50,236
Light contact is allowed to the body,
and I do mean light, Mr. Barnes.

1484
01:41:50,320 --> 01:41:52,363
No face contact is allowed.

1485
01:41:52,614 --> 01:41:55,700
Any violation of the rules
will result in a penalty point.

1486
01:41:56,785 --> 01:41:57,577
On your lines.

1487
01:41:57,660 --> 01:41:59,370
Come on, Daniel!

1488
01:42:00,413 --> 01:42:04,250
Face this way, bow. Face each other, bow.

1489
01:42:04,626 --> 01:42:06,086
I said bow.

1490
01:42:07,045 --> 01:42:09,756
Fighting positions. Ready? Begin!

1491
01:42:13,510 --> 01:42:17,180
Break, break! Let's go.
Out of the ring. No point.

1492
01:42:17,263 --> 01:42:18,473
Begin!

1493
01:42:22,435 --> 01:42:23,978
<i>Point, Barnes.</i>

1494
01:42:24,062 --> 01:42:26,106
<i>Score: 1-0.</i>

1495
01:42:26,189 --> 01:42:27,816
Look over at the slope.

1496
01:42:27,899 --> 01:42:29,442
Is that perfect?

1497
01:42:30,235 --> 01:42:33,404
One point Barnes for the punch.
Fighting positions.

1498
01:42:33,530 --> 01:42:34,906
Begin!

1499
01:42:39,661 --> 01:42:42,997
Danny-boy, how are the family jewels?

1500
01:42:43,456 --> 01:42:46,292
Get off the mat! Now! Get off the mat!

1501
01:42:46,376 --> 01:42:48,837
Do that again, Barnes,
and you're disqualified.

1502
01:42:48,920 --> 01:42:53,383
<i>That illegal groin kick</i>
<i>will cost Barnes his previous point.</i>

1503
01:42:53,758 --> 01:42:56,594
<i>Score is now 0-0.</i>

1504
01:42:56,928 --> 01:42:59,139
Kick to the groin. Penalty point.

1505
01:42:59,222 --> 01:43:01,766
- Score is 0-0.
- You're dirty, Barnes.

1506
01:43:01,850 --> 01:43:05,895
- He'll get you 'cause you're dirty.
- Fighting positions. Ready? Begin!

1507
01:43:14,654 --> 01:43:16,197
That's the one, Mike.

1508
01:43:16,281 --> 01:43:19,284
<i>Barnes scores the point. Reverse punch.</i>

1509
01:43:19,367 --> 01:43:20,785
Go, Daniel!

1510
01:43:21,578 --> 01:43:23,246
Come on, Daniel.

1511
01:43:23,955 --> 01:43:25,707
Let's go, LaRusso.

1512
01:43:27,417 --> 01:43:28,710
Point Barnes.

1513
01:43:28,835 --> 01:43:30,879
Score is 1-0. Ready?

1514
01:43:30,962 --> 01:43:33,089
Come on, Mike, you got him.

1515
01:43:33,256 --> 01:43:34,632
Begin!

1516
01:43:36,217 --> 01:43:38,136
Break, break!

1517
01:43:38,553 --> 01:43:40,096
On your line!

1518
01:43:40,722 --> 01:43:44,100
That's it, Barnes.
One more violation and you're disqualified.

1519
01:43:44,184 --> 01:43:47,312
<i>That illegal punch</i>
<i>will cost Barnes one point.</i>

1520
01:43:47,562 --> 01:43:49,773
<i>The score is again 0-0.</i>

1521
01:43:49,856 --> 01:43:51,858
You all right, LaRusso?

1522
01:43:52,984 --> 01:43:55,403
Intentional face contact, penalty point.

1523
01:43:55,487 --> 01:43:57,697
- Perfect.
- Score is 0-0.

1524
01:43:58,031 --> 01:43:59,949
Fighting positions.

1525
01:44:00,033 --> 01:44:01,868
Ready? Begin!

1526
01:44:05,497 --> 01:44:08,124
Now the real pain begins, Danny-boy.

1527
01:44:09,918 --> 01:44:11,211
On your lines.

1528
01:44:12,295 --> 01:44:14,714
That's a warning
for running out of the ring.

1529
01:44:14,798 --> 01:44:16,132
Come on, Barnes!

1530
01:44:18,218 --> 01:44:21,012
Fighting positions. Ready? Begin!

1531
01:44:25,391 --> 01:44:27,602
Break! Break!

1532
01:44:27,894 --> 01:44:29,270
On your line.

1533
01:44:29,479 --> 01:44:30,772
He'll get up.

1534
01:44:30,897 --> 01:44:32,774
He's too dumb not to.

1535
01:44:33,942 --> 01:44:36,778
LaRusso, on your line.

1536
01:44:37,362 --> 01:44:39,405
Get up, you pansy-ass!

1537
01:44:41,699 --> 01:44:44,661
- No point for kick to the back.
- <i>No point scored.</i>

1538
01:44:44,786 --> 01:44:48,998
- This is beautiful. It's beautiful.
- Fighting positions. Ready? Begin!

1539
01:44:52,293 --> 01:44:53,420
Break!

1540
01:44:55,213 --> 01:44:57,465
What's the matter, you can't breathe?

1541
01:44:57,549 --> 01:45:00,301
- On your line.
- I love it when he pounds him!

1542
01:45:01,511 --> 01:45:04,389
- On your line.
- This is more fun than I thought.

1543
01:45:04,514 --> 01:45:07,142
<i>No clean technique on that exchange.</i>

1544
01:45:07,434 --> 01:45:09,018
<i>No point scored.</i>

1545
01:45:09,477 --> 01:45:12,021
<i>The score remains 0-0.</i>

1546
01:45:12,522 --> 01:45:14,691
<i>Ten seconds left in the match.</i>

1547
01:45:14,774 --> 01:45:16,693
- Let's go, Danny.
- Fighting positions.

1548
01:45:16,776 --> 01:45:19,487
- You gotta turn it around.
- Ready? Begin!

1549
01:45:20,697 --> 01:45:21,990
Time!

1550
01:45:22,657 --> 01:45:24,033
Break!

1551
01:45:24,784 --> 01:45:27,203
<i>There will be a one-minute rest period.</i>

1552
01:45:27,287 --> 01:45:30,123
<i>Then the match will continue</i>
<i>with sudden death.</i>

1553
01:45:30,206 --> 01:45:33,585
- Daniel-<i>san</i>!
- Mr. Miyagi, it's over.

1554
01:45:34,002 --> 01:45:35,378
- No!
- It's over, forget it.

1555
01:45:35,462 --> 01:45:37,213
- No!
- I'm afraid. Let's go.

1556
01:45:37,297 --> 01:45:39,007
- I want to go home.
- Can't! You must not!

1557
01:45:39,090 --> 01:45:40,842
Is okay to lose to opponent.

1558
01:45:40,925 --> 01:45:44,304
- Must not lose to fear!
- Yeah, well, I'm afraid!

1559
01:45:44,387 --> 01:45:48,016
I'm afraid of him, all right?
What do you want me to do?

1560
01:45:48,892 --> 01:45:50,894
You stay focused.

1561
01:45:52,145 --> 01:45:55,565
Daniel-<i>san</i>,
your best karate is still inside you.

1562
01:45:56,065 --> 01:45:57,776
Now time let out!

1563
01:45:59,944 --> 01:46:02,447
<i>That's the end of the rest period.</i>

1564
01:46:02,530 --> 01:46:05,366
- Fighters on your lines.
- Come on, get up!

1565
01:46:05,492 --> 01:46:07,994
Get on that line!
Get on that line, LaRusso!

1566
01:46:08,077 --> 01:46:10,580
You're worthless!
Your slope teacher's nothing!

1567
01:46:10,663 --> 01:46:13,374
Get up, man!
You're no champion. Get up!

1568
01:46:13,500 --> 01:46:15,960
You suck, LaRusso! You suck, man!

1569
01:46:16,044 --> 01:46:19,130
And your teacher's karate is shit.
You hear me? He's shit!

1570
01:46:19,214 --> 01:46:20,757
You're done, LaRusso.

1571
01:46:20,840 --> 01:46:23,635
Your karate is a joke.
And your teacher's worth shit.

1572
01:46:23,718 --> 01:46:29,307
He's nothing! And you're nothing!
I own you! I own you, LaRusso!

1573
01:46:29,432 --> 01:46:32,644
Where's your little Jap teacher now?
He's a phoney, man.

1574
01:46:32,727 --> 01:46:34,646
He's a fake
and he didn't teach you nothing.

1575
01:46:34,729 --> 01:46:36,189
Your karate's shit. You hear me?
Get up!

1576
01:46:38,483 --> 01:46:41,486
Come on, Mike!
This is what we've been waiting for!

1577
01:46:47,117 --> 01:46:48,827
Fighting positions.

1578
01:46:49,119 --> 01:46:50,328
Ready?

1579
01:46:51,454 --> 01:46:52,664
Begin!

1580
01:46:52,956 --> 01:46:55,208
Mike! Take him out!

1581
01:47:00,463 --> 01:47:01,756
Hit him!

1582
01:47:05,260 --> 01:47:07,554
Get the point! Get the point!

1583
01:47:08,054 --> 01:47:11,224
Hit him, Mike! He's hallucinating.

1584
01:47:19,732 --> 01:47:21,109
Winner!

1585
01:47:21,192 --> 01:47:26,322
<i>The winner and the first to ever win</i>
<i>two years in a row...</i>

1586
01:47:27,157 --> 01:47:30,368
<i>... the grand champion, Daniel LaRusso. </i>

1587
01:47:32,245 --> 01:47:35,290
Mr. Miyagi, forget about it!

1588
01:47:54,726 --> 01:47:57,562
We did it! We did it!
