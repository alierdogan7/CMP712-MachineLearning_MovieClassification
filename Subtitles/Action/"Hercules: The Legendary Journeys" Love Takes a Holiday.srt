That's it.

497
00:37:44,762 --> 00:37:46,264
Come on.

498
00:37:59,176 --> 00:38:01,178
[ Both Panting ]

499
00:38:02,179 --> 00:38:04,682
You all right?
Yeah. I'm fine.

500
00:38:04,682 --> 00:38:06,984
Thanks.

501
00:38:06,984 --> 00:38:08,986
We're family, right?

502
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:11,856
So we are.

503
00:38:11,856 --> 00:38:14,859
In one day, I lose a son
and gain a grandson.

504
00:38:14,859 --> 00:38:18,863
To think, if Skouros hadn't
wandered off like that,
you wouldn't be alive.

505
00:38:18,863 --> 00:38:20,865
Uh, yeah.

506
00:38:21,365 --> 00:38:26,370
I-- I guess sometimes things
really do work out the way
they're supposed to.

507
00:38:26,871 --> 00:38:31,042
What courage you have.
I'm so proud of you.

508
00:38:35,546 --> 00:38:37,381
Thanks.

509
00:38:41,118 --> 00:38:43,621
You think you can make it back
to Syllabus on your own?
Yes.

510
00:38:43,621 --> 00:38:46,524
Are you going
after Iagos?
Somebody has to.

511
00:38:47,024 --> 00:38:49,427
Please be careful.
Yeah.

512
00:38:57,735 --> 00:39:02,273
Not happy with the decor?
Hey, I think this place smokes.

513
00:39:02,740 --> 00:39:07,745
You're still here.
Yeah, I cleared
my afternoon schedule.

514
00:39:07,745 --> 00:39:11,248
Tell me one thing:
Why Leandra?

515
00:39:12,750 --> 00:39:17,755
A pale imitation, but...
she reminded me of you.

516
00:39:20,257 --> 00:39:23,260
When Iagos returns with her,
I'll send her back
to the village.

517
00:39:23,694 --> 00:39:26,630
Syllabus is free.

518
00:39:26,630 --> 00:39:31,135
That's what you wanted
to hear from me, isn't it?
No.

519
00:39:31,135 --> 00:39:35,639
What I want is
the answer to my question.

520
00:39:36,173 --> 00:39:38,142
Do you love me?

521
00:39:40,111 --> 00:39:42,113
For centuries.

522
00:39:52,223 --> 00:39:56,660
Okay. This can be easy,
or it can be hard.

523
00:39:56,660 --> 00:40:00,598
- You choose.
- I already have.

524
00:40:00,598 --> 00:40:03,534
[ Laughing ]

525
00:40:05,002 --> 00:40:07,438
Yaah!
No, no. Not there.

526
00:40:07,438 --> 00:40:10,441
Over here.

527
00:40:15,746 --> 00:40:20,184
Very good! But how long
will your luck hold out?

528
00:40:23,187 --> 00:40:25,689
[ Laughing ]

529
00:40:25,689 --> 00:40:30,194
A room full of weapons
fit for the gods,
and you choose a broom.

530
00:40:30,194 --> 00:40:32,696
Yeah. Well, I don't wanna
kill you, Iagos.

531
00:40:33,197 --> 00:40:36,700
Then you're unluckyandfoolish.
Not even worth my energy.

532
00:40:36,700 --> 00:40:39,170
I'm leaving.

533
00:40:44,074 --> 00:40:47,077
I lied.
[ Laughing ]

534
00:40:51,081 --> 00:40:52,950
Which side of the sword
am I on?

535
00:40:52,950 --> 00:40:56,954
You're trying to remember if
I'm right-handed or left-handed.

536
00:40:58,422 --> 00:41:00,891
[ Chuckling ]

537
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:06,363
- Aah!
-Uh!

538
00:41:12,570 --> 00:41:15,072
That'd be left-handed.

539
00:41:17,041 --> 00:41:18,976
Kill him now!

540
00:41:23,414 --> 00:41:25,416
Here we go again.

541
00:41:44,068 --> 00:41:46,337
[ Screaming ]

542
00:41:51,609 --> 00:41:53,644
What a waste.

543
00:41:56,580 --> 00:41:58,582
[ Sighing ]

544
00:42:01,051 --> 00:42:04,522
You trapped my panther,
bested my shield...

545
00:42:04,522 --> 00:42:07,892
and defeated
my armored warriors.

546
00:42:07,892 --> 00:42:09,894
Guess I was on a roll.

547
00:42:09,894 --> 00:42:12,363
Where's Aphrodite?

548
00:42:12,363 --> 00:42:17,868
You brought her to me.
And for that,
I'll be forever grateful.

549
00:42:17,868 --> 00:42:20,237
[ Aphrodite ]
Me too.
[ Chuckles ]

550
00:42:20,237 --> 00:42:23,240
Sorry I didn't cover your back
with those moves you showed me.
I was busy showing Hephy here...

551
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:26,544
some moves of my own.
Dite, please.

552
00:42:26,544 --> 00:42:28,779
- "Dite"?
- The God of Fire.

553
00:42:28,779 --> 00:42:32,283
It only takes one little spark
to start an awesome flame.

554
00:42:32,283 --> 00:42:37,288
- So things are back to normal
  between men and women, right?
- Totally.

555
00:42:37,288 --> 00:42:40,190
I've decided to leave
the action business up to
my big brother Hercules.

556
00:42:40,190 --> 00:42:42,526
That's a relief.

557
00:42:42,526 --> 00:42:46,030
Well, I'm gonna go and say
good-bye to my grandmother.

558
00:42:46,463 --> 00:42:49,900
Remember if you or Hercules
ever need any weapons--
Hercules doesn't do weapons.

559
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:53,871
Oh, sweet cheeks.
I already got a petition
from some babe in Parthea.

560
00:42:56,874 --> 00:42:58,876
Evanthea. Huh!

561
00:42:58,876 --> 00:43:01,812
- She wants to see me again.
- Go and make somebody happy.

562
00:43:01,812 --> 00:43:03,314
Yeah.

563
00:43:03,314 --> 00:43:06,250
Or don't you and Hercules
do that either?
