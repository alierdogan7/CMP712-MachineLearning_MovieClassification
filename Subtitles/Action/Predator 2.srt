00:15:43,274 --> 00:15:44,707
Disregard for direct orders...

187
00:15:44,775 --> 00:15:46,208
from a supervising officer.

188
00:15:46,277 --> 00:15:49,212
Now get back to your cage
at Alvarado.

189
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:50,372
I'll show you
insubordination...

190
00:15:50,448 --> 00:15:52,211
you son of a bitch!

191
00:15:52,283 --> 00:15:53,716
No, no, no!

192
00:15:53,784 --> 00:15:55,046
Where you running to?

193
00:15:55,119 --> 00:15:57,053
You don't need this, Mike.

194
00:15:57,121 --> 00:15:58,383
It's not worth it.

195
00:15:58,456 --> 00:15:59,548
Relax.

196
00:15:59,624 --> 00:16:02,024
Oh, fuck!

197
00:16:04,328 --> 00:16:06,455
¤ [Spanish Rap]

198
00:16:21,612 --> 00:16:23,546
[Tony Pope]
Here's an update.

199
00:16:23,614 --> 00:16:26,048
In the midst of a shootout...

200
00:16:26,117 --> 00:16:28,210
five members
of one Colombian drug gang...

201
00:16:28,286 --> 00:16:30,720
were apparently ambushed
by their bloody rivals...

202
00:16:30,788 --> 00:16:32,221
<i>the Jamaican Voodoo Posse... </i>

203
00:16:32,290 --> 00:16:34,724
<i>who escaped</i>
<i>without a trace again... </i>

204
00:16:34,792 --> 00:16:36,225
<i>making total fools... </i>

205
00:16:36,294 --> 00:16:38,228
Back there.

206
00:16:38,296 --> 00:16:40,628
Listen, lady,
you got a backed-up toilet...

207
00:16:40,698 --> 00:16:43,223
call a plumber, not the cops.

208
00:16:43,301 --> 00:16:45,235
This license is expired.

209
00:16:45,303 --> 00:16:46,361
Bullshit.

210
00:16:46,437 --> 00:16:48,234
I paid that fee
six months ago.

211
00:16:48,306 --> 00:16:49,739
I'll kick your ass!

212
00:16:49,807 --> 00:16:51,240
Sit down!
Right now!

213
00:16:51,309 --> 00:16:52,298
Move!

214
00:16:52,376 --> 00:16:54,640
Just calm the fuck down!

215
00:17:01,319 --> 00:17:03,753
And all you got to do...

216
00:17:03,821 --> 00:17:06,756
is tee it high and let it fly.

217
00:17:06,824 --> 00:17:09,759
Ah-ooh!
Dead solid perfect.

218
00:17:09,827 --> 00:17:11,260
Now, remember,
for distance...

219
00:17:11,329 --> 00:17:14,765
you got to hold it
gently, but firmly.

220
00:17:14,832 --> 00:17:16,265
Lieutenant Harrigan!

221
00:17:16,334 --> 00:17:17,767
Detective Lambert,
Rampart Division.

222
00:17:17,835 --> 00:17:19,769
Kid, just have a seat.

223
00:17:19,837 --> 00:17:21,771
I'll be right with you.

224
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:22,931
Hey, Cap.

225
00:17:23,007 --> 00:17:24,599
Don't start with me, Mike.

226
00:17:24,675 --> 00:17:26,267
Heinemann's
so far up my ass...

227
00:17:26,344 --> 00:17:27,675
I won't sit down
for a week.

228
00:17:27,745 --> 00:17:29,679
We're not
winning this war.

229
00:17:29,747 --> 00:17:32,807
You have to play
the game on this one.

230
00:17:32,883 --> 00:17:35,818
"Effective immediately,
a federal task force...

231
00:17:35,886 --> 00:17:38,286
"under the direction
of Special Agent Peter Keyes...

232
00:17:38,356 --> 00:17:40,290
"will be investigating
criminal activities...

233
00:17:40,358 --> 00:17:41,825
"involving the trafficking...

234
00:17:41,892 --> 00:17:44,156
and distribution of
controlled substances. "

235
00:17:44,228 --> 00:17:47,789
And you will extend him
your full cooperation.

236
00:17:47,865 --> 00:17:51,130
You're cutting off my dick
and shoving it up my ass.

237
00:17:51,202 --> 00:17:53,136
The feds are calling
the shots on this.

238
00:17:53,204 --> 00:17:54,466
My hands are tied.

239
00:17:54,538 --> 00:17:55,596
Yeah?

240
00:17:55,673 --> 00:17:57,766
Captain Pilgrim.
Peter Keyes.

241
00:17:57,842 --> 00:18:00,276
Well, it's good
to meet you.

242
00:18:00,344 --> 00:18:01,868
Nice to meet you, sir.

243
00:18:01,946 --> 00:18:03,277
Lieutenant Mike Harrigan...

244
00:18:03,347 --> 00:18:05,542
Special Agent
Peter Keyes, DEA.

245
00:18:05,616 --> 00:18:07,481
I've heard
a lot about you.

246
00:18:07,551 --> 00:18:11,282
I'm sorry for this
jurisdictional intrusion.

247
00:18:11,355 --> 00:18:14,483
Don't mean to be
stepping on your toes...

248
00:18:14,558 --> 00:18:15,752
but we're attempting...

249
00:18:15,826 --> 00:18:18,192
to prevent King Willie's
voodoo gangs...

250
00:18:18,262 --> 00:18:20,287
from taking over
the entire West Coast.

251
00:18:20,364 --> 00:18:23,299
I wish I could tell you more...

252
00:18:23,367 --> 00:18:25,801
but we have a large number...

253
00:18:25,870 --> 00:18:27,895
of deep-cover operatives
involved here.

254
00:18:27,972 --> 00:18:29,906
You know how it is.

255
00:18:29,974 --> 00:18:32,807
We all have a job to do.

256
00:18:32,877 --> 00:18:35,311
I'm sure we can respect
each other's situation...

257
00:18:35,379 --> 00:18:37,472
and act responsibly.

258
00:18:37,548 --> 00:18:40,210
Well...

259
00:18:40,284 --> 00:18:43,549
um, cooperation...

260
00:18:43,621 --> 00:18:45,213
is my middle name.

261
00:18:52,063 --> 00:18:54,224
I'll see you around.

262
00:19:00,571 --> 00:19:02,232
Lieutenant,
I'm the new transfer.

263
00:19:02,306 --> 00:19:05,070
Have a seat.
I'll be right with you.

264
00:19:05,142 --> 00:19:06,575
Who is this dude?

265
00:19:06,644 --> 00:19:07,975
Yeah, what an asshole.

266
00:19:10,314 --> 00:19:12,407
All right, Danny,
what we got?

267
00:19:12,483 --> 00:19:13,780
What do we got?

268
00:19:13,851 --> 00:19:16,752
Five lowlife Scorpions
make it into the building.

269
00:19:16,821 --> 00:19:18,254
The next minute...

270
00:19:18,322 --> 00:19:19,755
they're all shish kebab...

271
00:19:19,824 --> 00:19:21,621
not one bullet wound.

272
00:19:21,692 --> 00:19:23,421
Wasn't the drugs or money.

273
00:19:23,494 --> 00:19:24,927
There's a shitload
of that.

274
00:19:24,995 --> 00:19:27,429
Maybe King Willie
brought in some outside talent.

275
00:19:27,498 --> 00:19:28,931
He's making his big move.

276
00:19:28,999 --> 00:19:31,934
A pro would have split
the moment he heard the action.

277
00:19:32,002 --> 00:19:33,435
More than one
we would have seen.

278
00:19:33,504 --> 00:19:36,439
Whoever did this
waited until the last minute...

279
00:19:36,507 --> 00:19:40,443
and then took out four men armed
with machine guns by hand...

280
00:19:40,511 --> 00:19:43,446
and then got by us.

281
00:19:43,514 --> 00:19:46,915
Maybe we should
give him a job.

282
00:19:46,984 --> 00:19:49,452
Me and my partner
bolt up the stairs...

283
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:50,953
somebody's screaming
bloody murder...

284
00:19:51,021 --> 00:19:53,319
- you got to hear this. You got to hear this.
- What?

285
00:19:53,390 --> 00:19:55,449
Hey, I forgot to tell you.

286
00:19:55,526 --> 00:19:56,959
See that guy there?

287
00:19:57,027 --> 00:19:59,962
That's Freddy's replacement.

288
00:20:00,030 --> 00:20:02,931
This guy's Jerry Lambert...

289
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,400
the Lone Ranger
from Rampart station.

290
00:20:05,469 --> 00:20:06,902
That's the Lone Ranger?

291
00:20:06,971 --> 00:20:10,134
I thought he was here
to fix the air conditioner.

292
00:20:10,207 --> 00:20:12,801
I said,
"Lady, you are under arrest. "

293
00:20:12,877 --> 00:20:14,310
And she said, "Why?"

294
00:20:14,378 --> 00:20:16,972
I said, "Your husband's dead.
You killed him. "

295
00:20:17,047 --> 00:20:19,481
- Know what she said without missing a beat?
- No.

296
00:20:19,550 --> 00:20:23,987
She said, "I stabbed
that son of a bitch plenty of times.

297
00:20:24,054 --> 00:20:27,024
- He never died on me before. "
- [Laughs]

298
00:20:27,157 --> 00:20:29,489
Uh-oh.

299
00:20:29,559 --> 00:20:32,824
Looks like he's putting
the moves to Leona.

300
00:20:32,896 --> 00:20:34,761
His first big mistake.

301
00:20:38,301 --> 00:20:40,166
I have heard about you.

302
00:20:40,237 --> 00:20:41,499
Yeah?

303
00:20:41,571 --> 00:20:44,165
Yeah.
Like your last partner got shot.

304
00:20:44,241 --> 00:20:45,299
What?

305
00:20:45,375 --> 00:20:46,307
Well...

306
00:20:46,376 --> 00:20:47,707
Oy!

307
00:20:47,778 --> 00:20:50,508
Try that cowboy shit
with me, fucker...

308
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:52,844
and you can
kiss these good-bye.

309
00:20:52,916 --> 00:20:55,384
- Got it?
- Yeah, yeah. I got it.

310
00:20:55,452 --> 00:20:59,513
Well, well, I see
the three of you have met.

311
00:20:59,589 --> 00:21:02,524
Lambert,
if you're feeling up to it...

312
00:21:02,592 --> 00:21:05,356
why don't you
limp your way in...

313
00:21:05,429 --> 00:21:07,021
and go see the lieutenant.

314
00:21:07,097 --> 00:21:09,531
- He wants to talk to you.
- Yeah.

315
00:21:09,599 --> 00:21:11,123
Aah!

316
00:21:11,201 --> 00:21:12,634
You're a bad girl.

317
00:21:12,702 --> 00:21:14,033
Ooh, I liked that.

318
00:21:14,104 --> 00:21:15,401
No, no, no!

319
00:21:15,472 --> 00:21:19,135
Goddamn, is that bitch
on the rag or what?

320
00:21:21,745 --> 00:21:24,543
This is what
I call the speech, kid.

321
00:21:24,614 --> 00:21:28,550
I only give it once,
so pay attention.

322
00:21:28,618 --> 00:21:31,815
Until now, it's all
been fun and games...

323
00:21:31,888 --> 00:21:34,755
cops and robbers,
Dunkin' Donuts...

324
00:21:34,825 --> 00:21:36,725
but you're in the shit now.

325
00:21:36,793 --> 00:21:39,057
Metro Command
is a war zone.

326
00:21:39,129 --> 00:21:40,562
I've paid my dues.

327
00:21:40,630 --> 00:21:43,064
I busted my ass
to get my transfer.

328
00:21:43,133 --> 00:21:45,294
And that scares
the shit out of me.

329
00:21:45,368 --> 00:21:47,063
Nobody
requests to come here...

330
00:21:47,137 --> 00:21:49,071
unless they're looking
for a reputation.

331
00:21:49,139 --> 00:21:50,731
There's no room
for showboats...

332
00:21:50,807 --> 00:21:52,968
or anyone looking
to prove himself.

333
00:21:53,043 --> 00:21:54,738
Now don't get me wrong.

334
00:21:54,811 --> 00:21:56,574
We need good cops.

335
00:21:56,646 --> 00:21:58,113
They say you're good...

336
00:21:58,181 --> 00:22:00,115
but the team comes first.

337
00:22:00,183 --> 00:22:02,651
You live by that,
and you'll be okay...

338
00:22:02,719 --> 00:22:05,711
and we'll all be there for you.

339
00:22:05,789 --> 00:22:07,518
The door swings both ways.

340
00:22:07,591 --> 00:22:08,990
That's it.

341
00:22:15,165 --> 00:22:16,393
Hey, kid.

342
00:22:17,801 --> 00:22:19,996
Welcome to the war.

343
00:22:20,070 --> 00:22:22,163
[Moaning]

344
00:22:22,239 --> 00:22:30,472
Ohh!

345
00:22:30,547 --> 00:22:33,047
Aah!

346
00:22:41,491 --> 00:22:42,890
[Speaking Spanish]

347
00:22:42,959 --> 00:22:44,085
No!

348
00:22:45,562 --> 00:22:49,498
Okay, guys, this has
gone too far now, huh?

349
00:22:51,568 --> 00:22:54,002
Hey-Hey, guys...

350
00:22:54,070 --> 00:22:56,561
I- I know you're
trying to scare me, huh?

351
00:22:58,575 --> 00:23:02,011
Well, you did
a pretty good job, man.

352
00:23:02,078 --> 00:23:03,511
I'm scared now.

353
00:23:05,348 --> 00:23:07,441
Stop it now.

354
00:23:07,517 --> 00:23:08,916
I can pay you...

355
00:23:08,985 --> 00:23:11,010
$2 million, man.

356
00:23:11,087 --> 00:23:12,520
In cash...

357
00:23:12,589 --> 00:23:13,681
right now.

358
00:23:13,757 --> 00:23:15,452
This is not about money.

359
00:23:15,525 --> 00:23:17,857
This is about power.

360
00:23:17,928 --> 00:23:21,455
There's a new king
in the streets.

361
00:23:21,531 --> 00:23:25,331
This is a message
he has for your people.

362
00:23:25,402 --> 00:23:27,199
You are history.

363
00:23:27,270 --> 00:23:28,532
Fucking history...

364
00:23:28,605 --> 00:23:30,197
you goddamn <i>puto. </i>

365
00:23:38,615 --> 00:23:42,073

00:36:57,445 --> 00:36:58,878
a city bus...

546
00:36:58,946 --> 00:37:01,210
What about
10 commendations for valor...

547
00:37:01,282 --> 00:37:03,716
and the best
felony arrest record...

548
00:37:03,784 --> 00:37:06,218
in the history
of this department?

549
00:37:06,287 --> 00:37:09,222
That and my intervention
on your behalf...

550
00:37:09,290 --> 00:37:12,726
are the only reasons
you still have a job.

551
00:37:12,793 --> 00:37:14,226
The chief would charge you...

552
00:37:14,295 --> 00:37:17,230
with Detective Archuleta's
death and suspend you.

553
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:23,236
As it is,
he left it in my hands.

554
00:37:23,304 --> 00:37:25,238
Now this
John Wayne attitude...

555
00:37:25,306 --> 00:37:26,739
flagrant disregard
for policies...

556
00:37:26,807 --> 00:37:28,741
is going to end now.

557
00:37:28,809 --> 00:37:30,242
No one
under my command...

558
00:37:30,311 --> 00:37:32,245
is going to impede
the progress...

559
00:37:32,313 --> 00:37:35,214
of this federal task force
headed by agent Keyes.

560
00:37:35,282 --> 00:37:36,271
No one.

561
00:37:43,324 --> 00:37:46,555
That's it.
Dismissed.

562
00:37:53,367 --> 00:37:55,801
Mike, you're
too close to this.

563
00:37:55,870 --> 00:37:57,303
Stay out of it.

564
00:37:57,371 --> 00:37:58,804
It's a police matter.

565
00:37:58,873 --> 00:38:01,808
They can't keep
the department out of it.

566
00:38:01,876 --> 00:38:03,309
We'll find Danny's killer.

567
00:38:03,377 --> 00:38:06,312
Captain, Danny and I
came up together...

568
00:38:06,380 --> 00:38:08,814
15 years
on the fucking street.

569
00:38:08,883 --> 00:38:11,317
Whoever killed him's
going to pay.

570
00:38:11,385 --> 00:38:12,818
I'm going to finish it.

571
00:38:21,829 --> 00:38:22,761
Hey!

572
00:38:25,599 --> 00:38:28,033
Hey, come on.
What is this?

573
00:38:33,441 --> 00:38:36,672
Listen, shithead. I don't give
a fuck who you really are...

574
00:38:36,744 --> 00:38:39,008
what you want
with this asshole.

575
00:38:39,079 --> 00:38:40,273
Because now it's personal...

576
00:38:40,347 --> 00:38:42,281
and he's a dead man.

577
00:38:42,349 --> 00:38:45,443
What you're dealing with
is way over your head.

578
00:38:45,519 --> 00:38:48,454
You don't know
what <i>you're</i> dealing with.

579
00:38:48,522 --> 00:38:50,114
And I'm warning you.

580
00:38:50,191 --> 00:38:53,126
Stay the fuck
out of my way!

581
00:39:03,771 --> 00:39:05,705
I'll take care of him.

582
00:39:05,773 --> 00:39:08,606
No. Let him go.

583
00:39:08,676 --> 00:39:10,769
We're too close.

584
00:39:16,116 --> 00:39:18,050
<i>[Tony Pope]</i> <i>... Claiming as
his,</i> <i>turf already controlled... </i>

586
00:39:20,821 --> 00:39:24,484
Watch as we
continue our report.

587
00:39:24,558 --> 00:39:26,492
Yes, the word is out.

588
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:28,050
L.A. Is up for grabs...

589
00:39:28,128 --> 00:39:30,562
the spoils
of our once fine city...

590
00:39:30,631 --> 00:39:34,499
<i>going to the ruthless scum</i> <i>who can
spread</i> <i>the most carnage and blood. </i>

591
00:39:34,568 --> 00:39:36,502
Our latest update
on the scoreboard...

592
00:39:36,570 --> 00:39:39,232
5 assorted trash
and 1 good cop.

593
00:39:39,306 --> 00:39:41,740
One of the best
on our force.

594
00:39:41,809 --> 00:39:43,242
Who's next?
Where's the mayor?

595
00:39:43,310 --> 00:39:45,244
He's not even in the city...

596
00:39:45,312 --> 00:39:47,246
Forget it. It's over.

597
00:39:47,314 --> 00:39:48,747
Mike, goddamn it.

598
00:39:48,816 --> 00:39:51,751
This ain't your personal
little war, you know.

599
00:39:51,819 --> 00:39:53,343
I loved Danny, too.

600
00:39:53,420 --> 00:39:56,355
You said the only way
you survive down here...

601
00:39:56,423 --> 00:39:58,357
is because you're a team.

602
00:39:58,425 --> 00:40:00,359
Door swings
both ways, remember?

603
00:40:04,831 --> 00:40:07,664
All right.
We'll do it together.

604
00:40:09,169 --> 00:40:11,603
Come on.
Talk to me about Keyes.

605
00:40:11,672 --> 00:40:13,867
He's been everywhere.
We've been on him for three days.

606
00:40:13,940 --> 00:40:16,738
- They're not looking for drug dealers.
- Yeah.

607
00:40:16,810 --> 00:40:20,439
They're setting up
radar sensors all over downtown.

608
00:40:20,514 --> 00:40:22,448
I used my whole repertoire
to keep up with them.

609
00:40:22,516 --> 00:40:26,077
I had scanners on them.
They scrambled my shit up.

610
00:40:26,153 --> 00:40:28,246
They had equipment
I can't begin to touch...

611
00:40:28,321 --> 00:40:30,983
and then this morning...

612
00:40:31,058 --> 00:40:32,286
I lost them.

613
00:40:32,359 --> 00:40:34,827
- We lost them.
- Lost them where?

614
00:40:34,895 --> 00:40:37,329
Vernon and industry.
They fuckin' disappeared.

615
00:40:37,397 --> 00:40:38,762
The slaughterhouse
district?

616
00:40:38,832 --> 00:40:40,766
Yeah, and in
this heat, whoa!

617
00:40:40,834 --> 00:40:42,267
I mean B.O. And barbecue.

618
00:40:42,335 --> 00:40:43,927
Whatever Keyes is looking for...

619
00:40:44,004 --> 00:40:45,665
he's found it
or damn close to it.

620
00:40:45,739 --> 00:40:47,969
Leona, I want to meet
with King Willie.

621
00:40:48,041 --> 00:40:51,010
Willie and I seem
to have the same problem.

622
00:40:51,078 --> 00:40:53,410
In the meantime,
you come with me.

623
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:55,448
- Mike, it's impossible.
- Just do it.

624
00:40:57,484 --> 00:40:59,179
Oh, fuck.

625
00:41:01,588 --> 00:41:02,520
<i>Omega 1.</i>

626
00:41:02,589 --> 00:41:04,022
<i>We need an extension. </i>

627
00:41:04,091 --> 00:41:06,252
<i>This is Omega 1.</i>
<i>Please make sure... </i>

628
00:41:06,326 --> 00:41:07,691
we've got
22 minutes remaining...

629
00:41:07,761 --> 00:41:09,695

of operation.

630
00:41:09,763 --> 00:41:11,025
<i>Yes, sir. </i>

631
00:41:11,098 --> 00:41:13,032
Verify that
final telemetry check.

632
00:41:13,100 --> 00:41:15,193
Start your test now.

633
00:41:15,268 --> 00:41:17,202
Scan track 3... 2... 1...

634
00:41:17,270 --> 00:41:18,202
mark.

635
00:41:18,271 --> 00:41:22,640
Number 6, power up
on the U.V. Banks.

636
00:41:22,709 --> 00:41:25,906
We're complete on the lower
U.V. Banks. Ready for testing.

637
00:41:27,514 --> 00:41:30,039
Second level, check
for ambient temperature variations.

638
00:41:30,117 --> 00:41:31,550
You got two minutes.

639
00:41:31,618 --> 00:41:32,710
Now get going.

640
00:41:32,786 --> 00:41:35,220
<i>To all units... </i>

641
00:41:35,288 --> 00:41:37,722
<i>all units, you have</i>
<i>approximately 20 minutes... </i>

642
00:41:37,791 --> 00:41:39,452
<i>to finish your task. </i>

643
00:41:39,526 --> 00:41:40,458
<i>Increasing U. V.</i>

00:41:40,527 --> 00:41:41,459
<i>Confirmed. </i>

00:41:41,528 --> 00:41:42,859
<i>Up 42%.</i>

646
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:48,233
Your friend's death
was the result...

647
00:41:48,301 --> 00:41:50,735
of a massive intrusion
in the chest cavity...

648
00:41:50,804 --> 00:41:52,237
by an edged weapon...

649
00:41:52,305 --> 00:41:54,432
that nearly cleaved
the heart in two.

650
00:41:54,508 --> 00:41:56,533
Death was instantaneous.

651
00:41:56,610 --> 00:41:58,578
He was boned like a fish.

652
00:41:58,645 --> 00:42:01,170
I've never seen anything like this.

653
00:42:01,248 --> 00:42:03,011
Please do not touch anything.

654
00:42:03,083 --> 00:42:05,483
[Glass Breaking]

655
00:42:07,888 --> 00:42:10,914
Doctor, what about
the other victims?

656
00:42:10,991 --> 00:42:12,822
Anything there?

657
00:42:12,893 --> 00:42:16,090
The federal team brought in
their own forensic examiners.

658
00:42:16,163 --> 00:42:17,790
I am the medical examiner...

659
00:42:17,864 --> 00:42:20,298
and chief pathologist in the city.

660
00:42:20,367 --> 00:42:21,834
They've cut me out completely.

661
00:42:21,902 --> 00:42:25,599
Any way to look at evidence
the feds have collected?

662
00:42:25,672 --> 00:42:27,333
They must have run tests.

663
00:42:27,407 --> 00:42:29,637
- It won't be easy.
- Doctor...

664
00:42:30,944 --> 00:42:32,878
I pried this
from Danny's hands.

665
00:42:32,946 --> 00:42:35,380
It's what took him
into the rafters.

666
00:42:35,448 --> 00:42:36,710
It has no weight.

667
00:42:36,783 --> 00:42:38,410
But it cuts like steel.

668
00:42:38,485 --> 00:42:39,918
Let me see.

669
00:42:42,489 --> 00:42:47,859
We are now at 150,000 times
normal magnification.

670
00:42:52,866 --> 00:42:54,026
Astonishing.

671
00:42:54,100 --> 00:42:56,125
This material doesn't
correspond to anything...

672
00:42:56,203 --> 00:42:57,534
on the periodic table.

673
00:42:57,604 --> 00:43:00,095
Lieutenant, what
the hell is that thing?

674
00:43:00,207 --> 00:43:04,268
- You don't buy it in a hardware store.
- Military?

675
00:43:04,344 --> 00:43:07,142
Good guess... I'm assuming it
got away from them...

676
00:43:07,214 --> 00:43:09,148
or something
they want real bad.

677
00:43:09,216 --> 00:43:12,344
Keyes. We're getting
closer to what happened...

678
00:43:12,419 --> 00:43:14,614
Don't.

679
00:43:14,688 --> 00:43:17,122
Easy, kid.
Put your gun away.

680
00:43:17,190 --> 00:43:19,658

Detective Archuleta...

01:01:48,165 --> 01:01:50,326
Who got hit
this time?

903
01:01:50,400 --> 01:01:52,163
Five gang members...

904
01:01:52,235 --> 01:01:54,203
bunch of commuters.

905
01:01:54,271 --> 01:01:56,705
It doesn't make sense.

906
01:01:56,773 --> 01:01:59,003
They were all armed.

907
01:01:59,076 --> 01:02:01,010
What do you mean?

908
01:02:01,078 --> 01:02:02,909
It's the chief.

909
01:02:02,980 --> 01:02:03,912
Wait here.

910
01:02:03,981 --> 01:02:04,913
Yeah?

911
01:02:04,982 --> 01:02:06,643
What the hell's going on?

912
01:02:06,717 --> 01:02:10,016
- It's a damn nightmare. Civilians this time.
- Were they all killed?

913
01:02:10,087 --> 01:02:11,554
Just like the others.

914
01:02:55,632 --> 01:02:58,499
[Crunching]

915
01:02:58,568 --> 01:03:00,433
Aah!

916
01:03:00,504 --> 01:03:02,904
Oh! Jerry!

917
01:03:23,293 --> 01:03:24,317
Holy shit!

918
01:03:24,394 --> 01:03:26,692
What the hell
is going on here?

919
01:03:26,763 --> 01:03:28,697
Hey, guys.
Get the camera.

920
01:03:28,765 --> 01:03:30,733
Get the camera on that.

921
01:03:43,046 --> 01:03:44,741
Hey, Harrigan!

922
01:03:44,815 --> 01:03:48,012
More victims!
More mutilations!

923
01:03:48,085 --> 01:03:49,245
Fuck you!

924
01:03:50,620 --> 01:03:52,451
<i>Pope. Are you there, Pope?</i>

925
01:03:52,522 --> 01:03:53,853
<i>Pope, what's going on?</i>

926
01:05:19,242 --> 01:05:21,176
<i>Arrrgh!</i>

927
01:05:52,709 --> 01:05:54,643
Sir. The cop is back.

928
01:05:54,711 --> 01:05:55,700
God...

929
01:05:59,549 --> 01:06:01,915
Harrigan.

930
01:06:01,985 --> 01:06:04,715
Don't you show up in
the damndest places.

931
01:06:04,788 --> 01:06:06,585
Come here, Lieutenant.

932
01:06:06,656 --> 01:06:09,318
I got something
you might find interesting.

933
01:06:09,392 --> 01:06:10,723
What is this?

934
01:06:10,794 --> 01:06:13,729
How many times do
I have to tell you?

935
01:06:13,797 --> 01:06:16,891
You don't know what
you're dealing with.

936
01:06:18,501 --> 01:06:19,934
There's your killer.

937
01:06:20,003 --> 01:06:21,095
Wonderful, isn't it?

938
01:06:21,171 --> 01:06:24,607
Pheromone signature
left by his body.

939
01:06:24,674 --> 01:06:26,232
Punch up three.

940
01:06:26,309 --> 01:06:28,743
10 years ago,
one of his kind...

941
01:06:28,812 --> 01:06:29,972
stalked and eliminated...

942
01:06:30,046 --> 01:06:32,844
an elite Special Forces crew
in Central America.

943
01:06:32,916 --> 01:06:34,281
There were two survivors.

944
01:06:34,351 --> 01:06:36,285
They indicated
that when trapped...

945
01:06:36,353 --> 01:06:39,288
the creature activated
a self-destruct device...

946
01:06:39,356 --> 01:06:41,290
that destroyed
enough rain forest...

947
01:06:41,358 --> 01:06:43,383
to cover 300 city blocks.

948
01:06:43,460 --> 01:06:45,121
Remarkable weaponry.

949
01:06:45,195 --> 01:06:47,026
That's right, Lieutenant.

950
01:06:47,097 --> 01:06:49,463
- Other-world life forms.
- Huh?

951
01:06:50,834 --> 01:06:52,563
A fucking alien.

952
01:06:54,204 --> 01:06:57,196
Iwo Jima,
Cambodia, Beirut.

953
01:06:57,274 --> 01:06:59,242
Drawn by heat and conflict.

954
01:06:59,309 --> 01:07:00,833
He's on safari.

955
01:07:00,910 --> 01:07:02,070
Lions.

956
01:07:02,145 --> 01:07:03,203
The tigers.

957
01:07:03,280 --> 01:07:04,338
The bears.

958
01:07:04,414 --> 01:07:05,847
Oh, my.

959
01:07:05,915 --> 01:07:07,576
Trophies.

960
01:07:07,651 --> 01:07:09,346
That's the game, isn't it?

961
01:07:09,419 --> 01:07:11,683
You're the lion.

962
01:07:11,755 --> 01:07:13,689
This is his jungle.

963
01:07:13,757 --> 01:07:15,349
Why can't we see him?

964
01:07:15,425 --> 01:07:17,120
Defensive adaptations
are astounding.

965
01:07:17,193 --> 01:07:20,822
It's somehow able to bend light.
Perfect camouflage.

966
01:07:20,897 --> 01:07:23,991
- You admire the son of a bitch.
- Not what he does...

967
01:07:24,067 --> 01:07:25,500
For what he is.

968
01:07:25,568 --> 01:07:27,866
For what he can give us...

969
01:07:27,937 --> 01:07:30,497
A new era
of scientific technology.

970
01:07:30,573 --> 01:07:32,404
I've waited
a lifetime for this...

971
01:07:32,475 --> 01:07:34,490
and I'm not going
to miss the chance.

972
01:07:34,525 --> 01:07:36,505
And I'm not going
to miss the chance.

973
01:07:36,579 --> 01:07:39,070
We're picking up something
on the pheromone scanners.

974
01:07:45,555 --> 01:07:47,750
Target one
is on the roof.

975
01:07:47,824 --> 01:07:51,089
It's taken us over two weeks
to learn his patterns.

976
01:07:51,161 --> 01:07:53,527
He comes here every
two days to feed.

977
01:07:53,596 --> 01:07:55,257
Seems he likes beef.

978
01:07:55,332 --> 01:07:57,391
I didn't think
he was vegetarian.

979
01:07:57,467 --> 01:08:00,402
We've prepared
a trap for this predator.

980
01:08:00,470 --> 01:08:01,698
We're certain this being...

981
01:08:01,771 --> 01:08:04,535
can see in only one
spectrum of light...

982
01:08:04,607 --> 01:08:05,596
Infrared.

983
01:08:05,675 --> 01:08:06,607
Infrared?

984
01:08:06,676 --> 01:08:09,873
He hunts by
seeing our heat.

985
01:08:09,946 --> 01:08:11,208
Block the heat,
and he's blind.

986
01:08:11,281 --> 01:08:12,714
These suits
insulate body heat...

987
01:08:12,782 --> 01:08:14,716
making the team invisible
to the creature.

988
01:08:14,784 --> 01:08:16,217
We've flooded
the packing house...

989
01:08:16,286 --> 01:08:17,719
with radioactive dust.

990
01:08:17,787 --> 01:08:20,722
We've also installed
ultraviolet lighting everywhere.

991
01:08:20,790 --> 01:08:24,726
The dust adheres to his body,
making him visible.

992
01:08:24,794 --> 01:08:26,455
Liquid nitrogen.

993
01:08:26,529 --> 01:08:28,997
You're going
to freeze him.

994
01:08:29,065 --> 01:08:30,692
We have
to capture him.

995
01:08:30,767 --> 01:08:32,132
He's moving.

996
01:08:32,202 --> 01:08:33,169
Finally.

997
01:08:34,571 --> 01:08:36,004
Grab a seat.

998
01:08:36,072 --> 01:08:37,505
Enjoy the show.

999
01:08:37,574 --> 01:08:39,098
This is history.

1000
01:08:53,323 --> 01:08:55,757
Capture and isolation
is our objective.

1001
01:08:55,825 --> 01:08:58,350
Defensive action
only on my orders.

1002
01:08:59,496 --> 01:09:01,430
Power up.
Lights on.

1003
01:09:01,498 --> 01:09:02,965
Let's get him.

1004
01:09:16,813 --> 01:09:18,007
We're in.

1005
01:09:18,081 --> 01:09:20,413
Switch to ultraviolet.

1006
01:09:20,483 --> 01:09:22,713
Radio silence.
Out.

1007
01:09:22,786 --> 01:09:24,617
Engage ultraviolet units
"A" through " J."

01:09:49,546 --> 01:09:51,138
What's all this interference?

1009
01:09:51,214 --> 01:09:52,681
Correcting the problem, sir.

1010
01:11:07,155 --> 01:11:09,248
They're moving
to the second level.

1011
01:11:09,324 --> 01:11:12,691

the number two stairwell.

back against the wall.

01:13:06,374 --> 01:13:08,137
It's backing up.

1020
01:13:08,209 --> 01:13:09,938
It's moving away from them.

1021
01:13:10,011 --> 01:13:11,706
Your boys have been made.

1022
01:13:11,779 --> 01:13:13,212
It's circling behind them.

1023
01:13:13,281 --> 01:13:14,612
Get them out, Garber!

1024
01:13:14,682 --> 01:13:16,809
They're walking into a trap!

1026
01:13:19,420 --> 01:13:20,978

1031
01:13:27,228 --> 01:13:28,320

1032
01:13:28,396 --> 01:13:29,693

what you're doing.
