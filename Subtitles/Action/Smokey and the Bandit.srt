1
00:00:54,514 --> 00:00:57,726
You heard 'bout the legend
ofJesse James

2
00:00:57,893 --> 00:01:00,312
And John Henry
just to mention some names

3
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:03,857
Well, there's a truck-drivin' legend
in the South today

4
00:01:04,066 --> 00:01:07,486
A man called Bandit
from Atlanta, Ga.

5
00:01:07,694 --> 00:01:10,280
Every gearjammer
knows his name

6
00:01:10,447 --> 00:01:13,658
They swear he got asphalt
a-runnin'in his veins

7
00:01:13,867 --> 00:01:16,620
A foot like lead
and nerves like steel

8
00:01:16,828 --> 00:01:20,415
He's gonna go to glory
ridin' 18 wheels

9
00:01:20,582 --> 00:01:22,250
Oh, boy

10
00:01:22,417 --> 00:01:25,712
He left Atlanta back in '63

11
00:01:25,879 --> 00:01:28,590
Haulin'him a load
up to Tennessee

12
00:01:28,757 --> 00:01:31,760
He hit Mount Eeale
in a drivin'rain

13
00:01:31,927 --> 00:01:34,721
So hard he couldn't even see
the passin' lane

14
00:01:34,888 --> 00:01:38,016
Well, he started down the grade
when he lost a gear

15
00:01:38,183 --> 00:01:41,561
He hit them brakes,
found he had no air

16
00:01:41,728 --> 00:01:44,481
The Mount Eeale grade
is steep and long

17
00:01:44,648 --> 00:01:48,318
And everybody that seen it
thought the Bandit was gone

18
00:01:48,527 --> 00:01:49,903
All gone

19
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:53,448
Well, his truck jack-knifed
turned completely around

20
00:01:53,657 --> 00:01:56,535
He was comin' down backwards
'bout the speed of sound

21
00:01:56,743 --> 00:01:59,579
A lot of folks seen him
and they all say

22
00:01:59,788 --> 00:02:02,833
He had his head out the window
yellin', "Clear the way!"

23
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,877
Well, he got to the bottom
safe and sound

24
00:02:06,044 --> 00:02:08,880
Everybody asked Bandit
how he made it down

25
00:02:09,047 --> 00:02:12,009
He said, "Folks, when the truck
picked up too much speed

26
00:02:12,175 --> 00:02:15,929
"I just run along beside it
and drug my feet"

27
00:02:16,138 --> 00:02:19,224
Ya heard the legend
ofJesse James

28
00:02:19,391 --> 00:02:21,518
And John Henry
just to mention some names

29
00:02:21,685 --> 00:02:25,147
Well, there's a truck-drivin' legend
in the South today

30
00:02:25,355 --> 00:02:28,859
A man called Bandit
from Atlanta, Ga.

31
00:02:29,026 --> 00:02:31,528
Every gearjammer
knows his name

32
00:02:31,695 --> 00:02:34,656
They swear he's got asphalt
a-runnin'in his veins

33
00:02:34,823 --> 00:02:38,035
A foot like lead
and nerves like steel

34
00:02:38,201 --> 00:02:41,371
He's goin' up to glory
ridin' 18 wheels

35
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:44,374
Ah, tell me, boy

36
00:02:47,669 --> 00:02:49,546
Talk to me, guitar

37
00:03:02,392 --> 00:03:04,227
Hey, Kirk. How ya doin'?

38
00:03:04,394 --> 00:03:06,647
Tod Engels. How are ya?

39
00:03:09,399 --> 00:03:13,362
- This your rig, son?
- Yeah.

40
00:03:13,528 --> 00:03:15,947
Open it up. Let's see the manifest.

41
00:03:24,623 --> 00:03:29,252
Well, placin' you under arrest
for transportin' alcoholic beverages

42
00:03:29,419 --> 00:03:31,838
across state lines
without the proper permits.

43
00:03:32,005 --> 00:03:34,341
And that means you,
you dumb cowboy.

44
00:03:34,508 --> 00:03:38,178
You know truckin' Coors beer
east of Texas is bootleggin'.

45
00:03:38,345 --> 00:03:42,015
- This here's Georgia, son.
- Just a friendly bet.

46
00:03:42,182 --> 00:03:44,643
These two old boys put me up to it.

47
00:03:44,893 --> 00:03:46,895
Now, when ya gonna learn?

48
00:03:47,062 --> 00:03:51,650
Big and Little Enos Burdette make that
same bet with every gearjammer they can.

49
00:03:51,817 --> 00:03:53,777
I say he ain't gonna go
for your game.

50
00:03:53,986 --> 00:03:58,532
Son, from what I've heard, the biggest
thing about the Bandit is his ego,

51
00:03:58,699 --> 00:04:04,121
and I figure that plus a lot of my dollars,
and he'll try anything, legal or not.

52
00:04:04,287 --> 00:04:08,875
(ANNOUNCER) They've put on quite a show
for us today, haven't they, friends?

53
00:04:09,042 --> 00:04:14,506
Yes, sir, you have seen some of
the finest gearjammin'in all of this country.

54
00:04:14,673 --> 00:04:19,803
Remember, these are the boys that take
the long hauls They really did it today.

55
00:04:22,556 --> 00:04:26,560
- Hoss... Where might I find the Bandit?
- I ain't seen him.

56
00:04:26,727 --> 00:04:28,854
- Over there behind his rig.
- Who wants to see him?

57
00:04:29,021 --> 00:04:30,856
- Who's askin'?
- I'm askin'.

58
00:04:31,023 --> 00:04:35,193
'Cause I'm the guy payin' him $25 a day
so all his loyal fans can look at him.

59
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:38,113
Do it.

60
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:43,160
I'm buyin' your attraction
for a half an hour.

61
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,960
Egotistical son of a bitch.

62
00:04:52,169 --> 00:04:57,507
A guy that paints his truck like this would go
to a minister's funeral dressed in feathers.

63
00:04:57,674 --> 00:05:02,888
(BIG ENOS) See, son? Old legends
never die. They just lose weight.

64
00:05:03,055 --> 00:05:07,184
Seems like a legend and an out-of-work
bum look a lot alike, Daddy.

65
00:05:07,351 --> 00:05:11,396
(BIG ENOS)
Bandit, me and my son are here.

66
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:18,487
Oh, I love your suits.

67
00:05:18,695 --> 00:05:23,367
It must be a bitch gettin' a size
68 extra-fat and a 12 dwarf.

68
00:05:23,533 --> 00:05:28,538
I came to make a deal. What's he get
if he wins this truck rodeo thing?

69
00:05:28,705 --> 00:05:31,666
- (BANDIT) lf? I
- $5,000, Daddy.

70
00:05:31,833 --> 00:05:35,379
- Chicken-shit money.
- Just what the hell you want, anyway?

71
00:05:35,545 --> 00:05:40,050
You to get out of this dumb-ass rodeo
and accept a real challenge.

72
00:05:45,305 --> 00:05:50,560
(BANDIT) Gettin' to Texarkana and back
in 28 hours, that's no problem.

73
00:05:50,727 --> 00:05:55,107
- It ain't never been done before, hotshit.
- Watch your language, little lady.

74
00:05:55,232 --> 00:05:57,651
The problem is that Coors beer.

75
00:05:57,818 --> 00:06:02,280
You take that east of Texas
and that's, uh... that's bootleggin'.

76
00:06:02,447 --> 00:06:05,200
I believe you're just a little bit scared.

77
00:06:05,367 --> 00:06:08,453
Great psychology. Why don't you say
somethin' bad about my mother?

78
00:06:08,578 --> 00:06:11,873
- Your mama is so ugly...
- Look, you make this run for me.

79
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:14,584
These Peterbilts are worth $80,000.

80
00:06:14,751 --> 00:06:20,257
That comes to about three grand
an hour if you make it in 28 hours.

81
00:06:20,424 --> 00:06:22,718
How about that for a challenge?

82
00:06:22,884 --> 00:06:25,470
- Dad, I don't believe that that's necess...
- Never mind.

83
00:06:25,637 --> 00:06:28,181
Wait a minute. Why do you
want that beer so bad?

84
00:06:28,348 --> 00:06:30,976
Because he's thirsty, dummy.

85
00:06:31,184 --> 00:06:34,771
You see, I got a boy runnin' tomorrow
in the Southern Classic

86
00:06:34,938 --> 00:06:38,108
When he wins,
I wanna celebrate in style.

87
00:06:38,316 --> 00:06:42,571
- How much style?
- Well, I got a few friends and me.

88
00:06:42,738 --> 00:06:44,448
400 cases.

89
00:06:44,614 --> 00:06:48,660
- 400 cases...?
- Well?

90
00:06:48,827 --> 00:06:52,789
- Well, let me see your cash.
- Big Enos's word is gold.

91
00:06:54,291 --> 00:06:57,127
All right show him the cash.

92
00:06:57,294 --> 00:06:59,546
- Go ahead, Little.
- Shit.

93
00:07:01,798 --> 00:07:05,302
Let's see. There's 400 cases of beer,
I'll need the cash for that.

94
00:07:05,469 --> 00:07:08,472
No problem. Go ahead, boy.

95
00:07:08,597 --> 00:07:11,725
New car. Gotta have a new car
to block for the truck.

96
00:07:11,892 --> 00:07:18,231
- OK. Go ahead, boy.
- I'd like to kick his ass just once.

97
00:07:18,482 --> 00:07:20,359
Speedy car.

98
00:07:22,277 --> 00:07:24,946
Speedier than that.

99
00:07:25,113 --> 00:07:26,948
Go ahead.

100
00:07:48,053 --> 00:07:50,097
- Hello, darlin'.
- Hi, Uncle Bandit.

101
00:07:50,263 --> 00:07:52,307
- Which one of the house apes are you?
- Kate.

102
00:07:52,474 --> 00:07:54,810
He's droppin' 'em like flies, isn't he?

103
00:07:54,976 --> 00:07:58,021
Well, well, well. Hello, beautiful.

104
00:07:58,188 --> 00:08:00,816
- How about 'gorgeous'?
- You can't have him.

105
00:08:01,024 --> 00:08:03,860
Obviously you can. What are you
tryin' to do, start another race?

106
00:08:04,069 --> 00:08:07,489
Look, you got Cledus in jail once.
Leave us alonel

107
00:08:07,656 --> 00:08:09,950
- Hi, Uncle Banditl
- He ain't your damn unclel

108
00:08:10,158 --> 00:08:15,372
I always recognise youl You know why?
You always kick me in the ballsl

109
00:08:15,539 --> 00:08:18,333
Damn it, Banditl Look at mel

110
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:23,005
I find it hard to look at you, Waynette,
especially with those things in your hair.

111
00:08:23,171 --> 00:08:25,632
Makes me think you're listening
to a radio station in Savannah.

112
00:08:25,799 --> 00:08:29,553
You can't go in there and bother Cledus.
Heyl This is my homel

113
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:31,972
- Cledus.
- Nol

114
00:08:32,139 --> 00:08:35,851
I know in the past
I may have done you wrong.

115
00:08:36,935 --> 00:08:39,062
- Right?
- Right.

116
00:08:39,229 --> 00:08:44,359
However, in the future, Cledus,
I will never, ever do you wrong again.

117
00:08:44,526 --> 00:08:47,029
- Right?
- Right.

118
00:08:47,946 --> 00:08:54,161
We have a big chance, a big chance
to make a run for some big bucks.

119
00:08:54,786 --> 00:08:59,291
- 80,000 of them.
- Really?

120
00:08:59,458 --> 00:09:03,628
- Are we gonna kidnap the Pope or somethin'?
- How'd you guess?

121
00:09:03,795 --> 00:09:08,633
No. We're just gonna run over to Texarkana
and pick up 400 cases of Coors

122
00:09:08,759 --> 00:09:11,511
and bring it back in 28 hours.

123
00:09:11,678 --> 00:09:14,097
Whoal I got a flash for you.

124
00:09:14,264 --> 00:09:17,059
That's called bootleggin',
and that's against the law.

125
00:09:17,225 --> 00:09:20,854
Who gives a turkey when the Snowman
and the Bandit are runnin' the booze?

126
00:09:21,021 --> 00:09:23,648
- No one can stop us.
- Hold it right there.

127
00:09:23,815 --> 00:09:26,735
There ain't gonna be no more
Snowman and Bandit.

128
00:09:26,902 --> 00:09:32,074
Because I've got to go in the morning
to Conyers and pick up a load of manure.

129
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:35,160
- Shitty job.
- Can I ask you a question?

130
00:09:35,327 --> 00:09:37,037
Sure. Ask me.

131
00:09:37,204 --> 00:09:40,207
What the hell do we wanna go to
Texas for and haul beer back here?

132
00:09:40,374 --> 00:09:42,459
For the good old American life.

133
00:09:42,626 --> 00:09:46,129
For the money, for the glory
and for the fun.

134
00:09:46,296 --> 00:09:49,549
Mostly for the money. You know
what we're gonna do with the money?

135
00:09:49,716 --> 00:09:52,344
- What?
- We're gonna buy a new rig.

136
00:09:52,511 --> 00:09:55,931
- You're crazy, you know that.
- Yeah.

137
00:09:56,098 --> 00:09:59,768
- How much money did you say it was?
- $80,000.

138
00:09:59,935 --> 00:10:02,145
$80,000?

139
00:10:02,312 --> 00:10:04,189
- Hm.
- Waynettel

140
00:10:04,439 --> 00:10:08,652
Now, Bo, I'm tellin' ya,
Fred here ain't gonna be no problem.

141
00:10:08,819 --> 00:10:13,031
- I can see he'll be a major asset.
- Besides, he's one hellacious watchdog.

142
00:10:13,198 --> 00:10:16,576
- Well, let's get goin'.
- Whoa. Hold it a minute.

143
00:10:16,785 --> 00:10:20,122
I got to ask you a question.
Sit right there, Fred.

144
00:10:20,288 --> 00:10:23,458
You mean to tell me
we're gonna drive from here

145
00:10:23,625 --> 00:10:27,004
to Texarkana, Texas,
and back to here in 28 hours?

146
00:10:27,129 --> 00:10:29,715
It's only 900 miles there
and 900 miles back.

147
00:10:29,923 --> 00:10:33,468
Well, for your information,
that ain't never been done, not in no rig.

148
00:10:33,635 --> 00:10:37,806
'Cause you and I never done it in no rig.
You gotta stop thinkin' so negative.

149
00:10:37,973 --> 00:10:40,892
'Course we can make it.
We ain't never not made it yet, have we?

150
00:10:41,059 --> 00:10:43,812
- Well, no.
- You see? There you are.

151
00:10:43,979 --> 00:10:47,149
Yeah. Yeah, I see. I see all right.

152
00:10:47,357 --> 00:10:51,653
I see our asses in a sling
if we get caught that's what I see.

153
00:10:55,198 --> 00:10:58,160
Heyl Ho-ho-hol

154
00:10:58,326 --> 00:11:01,913
Well, God Almighty,
would you look at thatl

155
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:05,000
- It's beautiful, huh?
- Honey, hush.

156
00:11:06,668 --> 00:11:10,130
I don't guess we're gonna be ridin'
in the truck together this time?

157
00:11:10,297 --> 00:11:12,924
No, son. I'll be drivin' this one
and blockin'.

158
00:11:13,091 --> 00:11:15,761
You'll be drivin' the truck.
This is Bandit One and that is...

159
00:11:15,969 --> 00:11:18,221
...Bandit Two. Together again.

160
00:11:18,388 --> 00:11:22,809
- Like Fred and Ginger and Lester and Earl
- That's right. But we got a problem.

161
00:11:23,685 --> 00:11:26,772
You know them Smokeys
got them CBs in the car now.

162
00:11:26,938 --> 00:11:30,817
I haven't worked that out yet,
but I'm thinkin' about it.

163
00:11:30,984 --> 00:11:33,278
I got an idea.
Why don't we do this?

164
00:11:33,445 --> 00:11:37,532
If I say go to channel 21, forget it.
We ain't goin' to 21, we're goin' to 19.

165
00:11:37,699 --> 00:11:41,453
- 21 is 19?
- If I say go to channel six, forget it.

166
00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:44,414
- We go to three.
- I go to three. Perfect.

167
00:11:44,539 --> 00:11:47,542
- If I say go to channel two, we go to one.
- Two is one.

168
00:11:47,709 --> 00:11:49,961
- That'll confuse everybody.
- That'll confuse 'em.

169
00:11:50,128 --> 00:11:53,465
On the other hand,
if we stayed on the odd channels,

170
00:11:53,674 --> 00:11:56,593
switched every time and started
in the basement, that'd work, too.

171
00:11:56,760 --> 00:12:01,306
- That'd do it, too, wouldn't it?
- Well, yeah, that'd work too, I guess.

172
00:12:01,473 --> 00:12:04,601
- Let's haul ass.
- OK.

173
00:12:18,699 --> 00:12:21,284
(FRED BARKS)

174
00:12:26,415 --> 00:12:30,377
Breaker One. This is the Bandit.
Is the Snowman out there?

175
00:12:30,544 --> 00:12:33,046
- Am I hittin'ya, son?
- Mercy sakes.

176
00:12:33,213 --> 00:12:36,216
You put about eight and a half on me,
blowin' my windows out. Bring it on.

177
00:12:36,383 --> 00:12:41,013
I'll be within earshot.
You keep it wound up to around 90.

178
00:12:41,179 --> 00:12:44,766
- Hey, Bandit. Me and Fred's got a question.
- What do you and Fred want?

179
00:12:44,933 --> 00:12:48,437
How come we're doing this?
They said it couldn't be done.

180
00:12:48,603 --> 00:12:51,606
- That's the reason.
- That's good with Fredl

181
00:12:52,566 --> 00:12:53,984
10-4.

182
00:12:54,276 --> 00:12:57,904
Westbound and down

183
00:12:58,071 --> 00:13:00,991
We gonna do what they say
can't be done

184
00:13:01,158 --> 00:13:05,620
We've got a long way to go
and a short time to get there

185
00:13:05,787 --> 00:13:09,374
I'm westbound
Just watch ol'Bandit run

186
00:13:09,541 --> 00:13:13,462
Keep your foot hard on the pedal,
son, never mind them brakes

187
00:13:13,628 --> 00:13:17,090
Let it all hang out
'cause we got a run to make

188
00:13:17,299 --> 00:13:21,136
The boys are thirsty in Atlanta
and there's beer in Texarkana

189
00:13:21,345 --> 00:13:25,599
And we'll bring it back
no matter what it takes

194
00:14:04,221 --> 00:14:06,515
Old Smokey's
got them ears on

195
00:14:06,682 --> 00:14:08,684
He's hot on your trail

196
00:14:08,850 --> 00:14:11,895
And he ain't gonna rest
till you're in jail

197
00:14:12,062 --> 00:14:14,231
So you've got to dodge him
you've got to duck him

198
00:14:14,439 --> 00:14:16,358
You've got to keep
that diesel truckin'

199
00:14:16,566 --> 00:14:19,903
Just put that hammer down
and give it hell

200

we gonna be sorry for, son,

215
00:15:27,679 --> 00:15:30,223

I'm westbound
Just watch ol'Bandit run

220
00:16:33,078 --> 00:16:35,956
- Big town, ain't it?
- I wonder what they do for excitement.

221
00:16:36,123 --> 00:16:38,500
They probably sit around
and watch the cars rust.

222
00:16:38,667 --> 00:16:41,920
- Damn it, it's locked.
- We're about an hour ahead of schedule.

223
00:16:42,087 --> 00:16:45,132
- Let's keep it that way.
- All right.

224
00:16:55,475 --> 00:16:57,811
Hey, want a beer?

225
00:16:57,978 --> 00:17:00,856
- Well, sonl
- Redneck heaven.

226
00:17:01,023 --> 00:17:03,650
- How we gonna load all this stuff, though?
- I'll load it with this.

227
00:17:03,859 --> 00:17:07,571
- You can't drive no forklift.
- I can drive any forkin' thing around.

228
00:17:07,738 --> 00:17:10,449
- Get seriousl Can you drive this thing?
- I am serious.

229
00:17:10,615 --> 00:17:13,201
- Crank it up. Now back it up.
- Oh, shut upl

230
00:17:13,368 --> 00:17:18,332
- I said back it up, not raise it upl
- I am backin' up, ya big dumbbell!

00:17:18,498 --> 00:17:21,293
Hold itl The beerl Watch the beerl

232

- (LAUGHS) You all right?
- Very funny (l) Very funny (l)

233
00:17:27,841 --> 00:17:29,217
I thought it was funny.

234
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:33,805
Hey, we really oughta pay somebody
for that mess we made in there.

235
00:17:33,972 --> 00:17:36,892
- All right have you...
- I got that all worked out.

236
00:17:37,059 --> 00:17:41,063
You just leave a note. Tell the folks
to send the bill to Big Enos Burdette.

237
00:17:45,359 --> 00:17:53,200
"Send... bill... to... Big... Enos... Burdette."

are you out there? Come back.

242
00:18:10,801 --> 00:18:14,721
Snowmanl How we doin', son?
Come on back.

243
00:18:14,888 --> 00:18:17,099
Hang on just a minute,
and I'll tell ya.

244
00:18:20,018 --> 00:18:22,437
We're about 28 minutes ahead of schedule.

245
00:18:22,604 --> 00:18:24,898
- Come back.
- I hate to say I told you so.

246
00:18:25,065 --> 00:18:28,610
Don't lose your head, son.
We still got a lot of boogiein' to do.

247
00:18:28,735 --> 00:18:32,030
Put the pedal to the metal.
I'm 10-10 on the side.

248
00:18:32,197 --> 00:18:35,951
For sure. Me and Fred,
we got your back door, ain't we, Fred?

249
00:18:46,128 --> 00:18:50,882
- Sorry. I don't want to get married.
- Terrific That makes two of us.

250
00:18:51,550 --> 00:18:55,721
- Will you unzip me?
- Sure.

251
00:18:56,972 --> 00:18:59,307
- Does this thing move?
- Oh, yeah.

252
00:19:12,446 --> 00:19:14,281
(BLARES HORN)

253
00:19:38,305 --> 00:19:41,308
Where are we going?
No, don't tell me. Let me guess.

254
00:19:41,475 --> 00:19:45,520
- We are a bride in search of a wedding.
- No.

255
00:19:45,687 --> 00:19:51,193
There is a wedding in search of a bride.
Let me put it another way.

256
00:19:51,359 --> 00:19:55,405
Think of it as a wedding posse
in search of a bride.

257
00:19:55,572 --> 00:19:59,785
- You understand that cowboy?
- Yeah.

258
00:20:01,369 --> 00:20:03,705
What are ya doin'?

259
00:20:05,207 --> 00:20:07,376
- These are my shoes.
- Oh, yeah.

260
00:20:07,584 --> 00:20:10,212
- And these are my legs.
- Yeah.

261
00:20:10,379 --> 00:20:15,425
- What are you gonna do with them?
- With the shoes or the legs?

262
00:20:15,592 --> 00:20:19,179
Last time I saw legs like that
they had a message tied to 'em.

263
00:20:19,346 --> 00:20:24,142
What do you mean? These are
great little legs. I'm a professional.

264
00:20:25,310 --> 00:20:29,773
Well, in that case,
you shouldn't be dressed in white.

265
00:20:29,981 --> 00:20:32,901
- Dancer.
- Oh.

266
00:20:34,695 --> 00:20:37,614
Well, cowboys love fat calves.

267
00:20:38,698 --> 00:20:42,119
- They're not fat.
- They're bigger than mine.

268
00:20:42,327 --> 00:20:46,081
- Do we really wanna talk about legs?
- One of us does.

269
00:20:46,289 --> 00:20:52,212
Otherwise we wouldn't have gone...
What are we doing now?

270
00:20:52,421 --> 00:20:56,049
Well, I am getting my clothes, you fool.

271
00:20:56,883 --> 00:21:00,053
Good idea. Why don't you
slip into somethin' comfortable?

272
00:21:03,307 --> 00:21:07,102
Are we really going 110?
We're going 110I

273
00:21:07,269 --> 00:21:11,314
Why do you wear that cowboy hat?
Because you think it looks dazzling on you.

274
00:21:12,566 --> 00:21:15,110
I'd no idea this dress
would be so hard to get out of.

275
00:22:04,868 --> 00:22:06,953
Hold up on that car wash, gentlemen.

276
00:22:10,457 --> 00:22:12,876
Come here, son.

277
00:22:15,295 --> 00:22:17,214
Whoopsl

278
00:22:19,341 --> 00:22:22,636
You look tired, boy. Rest yourself.

279
00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:29,226
You punks look tuckered out, too.

280
00:22:34,648 --> 00:22:37,317
That's an attention-getter.

281
00:22:38,151 --> 00:22:42,239
- Now, a lady in a weddin' gown.
- Yes, sir.

282
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:46,034
- Get in a car?
- Yes, sir.

283
00:22:46,201 --> 00:22:49,287
- See who was drivin'?
- N-no, sir.

284
00:22:51,665 --> 00:22:56,128
- Licence plate?
- Y-yes, sir. Georgia plates.

285
00:22:56,294 --> 00:22:58,088
"Ban-one."

286
00:22:58,255 --> 00:23:02,718
B-A-N dash O-N-E.

287
00:23:02,884 --> 00:23:06,972
All right. Now, you boys
just stay here and watch the car.

288
00:23:07,180 --> 00:23:10,434
There might be some vandals around
who wanna steal somethin',

289
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:13,770
so you boys just stay here
and keep your hands on the car

290
00:23:13,937 --> 00:23:17,649
until one of my aassociates arrive.

291
00:23:17,858 --> 00:23:24,573
And don't go home, don't go to eat,
and don't play with yourself.

292
00:23:24,740 --> 00:23:27,909
It wouldn't look nice on my highway.

293
00:23:28,035 --> 00:23:34,291
Oh, you can think about it,
but don't do it.

294
00:23:49,348 --> 00:23:52,017
Hey, man, he's gone.
Let's get outta here.

295
00:23:52,184 --> 00:23:56,229
Shitl You do what you want.
I'm stayin' right here.

296
00:24:00,317 --> 00:24:04,488
28 years old and... Oh, goodness,
what's this? I'll tuck it right in.

297
00:24:04,655 --> 00:24:08,075
I was down here dancing
in a home appliance show.

298
00:24:08,241 --> 00:24:11,328
- I danced around three trash mashers.
- Talk to me, my boy.

299
00:24:11,536 --> 00:24:15,582
I had this costume that lit up.
I only short-circuited once.

300
00:24:15,749 --> 00:24:20,295
- Where did you get that seat cover, son?
- This ain't no seat cover.

301
00:24:20,462 --> 00:24:24,132
- I was standing in the parking lot...
- I'm sitting next to Lawrence of Arabia.

302
00:24:24,299 --> 00:24:29,054
I met this guy... These can't be my pants.
God, he was good-looking.

303
00:24:29,179 --> 00:24:31,556
- And he had this hat on...
- Funny, ain't she?

304
00:24:31,723 --> 00:24:36,812
I think he was from Texas or something,
and I thought "Why not marry the guy?"

305
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:44,027
Nobody walks out
on a pretty weddin' I set up.

306
00:24:44,194 --> 00:24:46,780
I'm gonna get that girl
and set everything straight.

307
00:24:46,947 --> 00:24:52,536
She insulted my town.
She insulted my son.

308
00:24:54,663 --> 00:24:58,875
- Look, what if we...
- Shut upl She insulted my authority.

309
00:25:00,252 --> 00:25:05,841
And that's nothin' but pure and simple
old-fashioned Communism.

310
00:25:06,008 --> 00:25:09,594
It happens every time one of those
dancers starts poontangin' around...

311
00:25:09,761 --> 00:25:11,805
with those show-folk fags.

312
00:25:11,972 --> 00:25:14,766
Halfway down the aisle I said to myself,

313
00:25:14,933 --> 00:25:17,477
"Jesus Christ, what are you doing?
His mother doesn't even have any teethl"

314
00:25:17,644 --> 00:25:20,814
I jumped in this car, and it blew up
on the side of the road,

315
00:25:20,981 --> 00:25:24,109
and I ended up in this goddamn airplane.
What do you do?

316
00:25:24,776 --> 00:25:27,404
I don't remember.

317
00:25:27,571 --> 00:25:32,075
- Oh, are we on the air?
- Sort of, yeah.

318
00:25:33,577 --> 00:25:37,205
You think I'm... nuts, don't you?

319
00:25:37,372 --> 00:25:39,791
No, I don't think you're crazy.

320
00:25:39,958 --> 00:25:44,504
I picked up three brides yesterday,
just like you, very subdued.

321
00:25:44,671 --> 00:25:47,966
Hey, what... what's goin' on up there?

322
00:25:48,425 --> 00:25:51,053
- Come back, Bandit
- Bandit?

323
00:25:51,219 --> 00:25:57,225
- Is that your name or your profession?
- That's my handle. Bo's my real name.

324
00:25:57,392 --> 00:25:59,895
- What's your name?
- Carrie.

325
00:26:00,062 --> 00:26:03,732
Is she wearing a wedding dress?

326
00:26:06,401 --> 00:26:07,819
She was.

327
00:26:07,944 --> 00:26:11,531
What's she wearin' now?
Come back.

328
00:26:11,698 --> 00:26:14,618
Hey, you got peanut butter
or somethin' in your ears?

329
00:26:14,785 --> 00:26:19,081
Tell me what that woman's got on...
her mindl

331
00:26:21,458 --> 00:26:25,379
No coozie's gonna leave me
at no church.

Decoratin' up a whole town
at a cost of $40.

333
00:26:29,383 --> 00:26:31,927
Right.

334
00:26:33,136 --> 00:26:38,934
I can see her now,
runnin' back up that aisle...

335
00:26:39,101 --> 00:26:42,354
No, she was dancin'
back up the aisle,

336
00:26:42,562 --> 00:26:45,524
her knockers bouncin'
all over the joint.

337
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,819
Let go of that wheel.

338
00:26:50,028 --> 00:26:52,864
Why, her ass was wigglin', too.

339
00:26:57,536 --> 00:27:01,206
Why so fast?
You're late for a big bowling date?

340
00:27:01,373 --> 00:27:02,916
Cute.

341
00:27:05,585 --> 00:27:10,507
- So, tell me about yourself.
- What do you wanna know, my sign?

342
00:27:10,674 --> 00:27:14,720
- What do you do besides drive fast?
- Have fun.

343
00:27:14,886 --> 00:27:18,265
- Is this fun?
- Drivin'?

344
00:27:18,432 --> 00:27:23,312
- Driving, talking to me.
- They're both a challenge.

345
00:27:25,021 --> 00:27:29,818
- You've got a great profile.
- Yeah, don't I? Especially from the side.

346
00:27:30,485 --> 00:27:32,863
At least we finally agree on something.

347
00:27:33,030 --> 00:27:36,408
Yeah. We both like half my face.

348
00:27:42,372 --> 00:27:45,959
Hey, would a cop taking a leak
on the side of the road interest you?

349
00:27:47,419 --> 00:27:49,796
Yes, it would.

350
00:27:49,963 --> 00:27:55,719
- He's taking a 10-100.
- At least it's better than a 10-200.

I'm runnin' blocker for 400 cases
of illegal Coors.

355
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:53,235
Holy shitl

356
00:28:55,529 --> 00:28:59,408
I don't believe this.
Funny, I don't remember that turn.

357
00:28:59,574 --> 00:29:03,870
- Bandit, where the hell are you?
- I'll be back on the highway in a second.

358
00:29:04,037 --> 00:29:06,289
All right, good buddy.
I'll keep my eyes peeled.

359
00:29:20,178 --> 00:29:24,057
- Them things are fabulous.
- I think I just went 10-100.

360
00:29:24,224 --> 00:29:28,437
- Well, it's better than 10-200.
- That's true.

361
00:29:35,569 --> 00:29:39,614
Well, the more wheels I got
the better I like it.

362

- You lucky devil, you got him.

364
00:29:51,918 --> 00:29:55,338
- Where the hell are you?
- I'm on a two-lane blacktop.

00:29:55,505 --> 00:30:00,010
Highway marker number 71.
How's our time doin'?

366
00:30:01,053 --> 00:30:06,308
Oh, how are we doin' on time?
About 25 minutes ahead of schedule.

367
00:30:06,516 --> 00:30:10,479
- What's your 20?
- I'm about four miles ahead of you, turkey.

368
00:30:10,687 --> 00:30:12,147
Not for long.

for you. Come on.

371
00:30:21,740 --> 00:30:25,577
- Well, talk to me, good buddy.
- You've got trouble comin'.

372
00:30:25,744 --> 00:30:29,331
Well, what's your handle, son,

Goddamn. That's a Texas mountie.
What the hell's he doin' in Arkansas?

375
00:30:42,677 --> 00:30:46,390
Well, let's just see what
he's got under the hood.

376
00:30:46,556 --> 00:30:48,225
Bye-bye, babyl

377

You smoke much?

378
00:31:04,241 --> 00:31:06,702
I just started.

379

- Oh, bring it on, you lucky devil.

00:31:14,668 --> 00:31:16,837
- Comin' around you.
- Be careful.

381
00:31:17,045 --> 00:31:20,674
You're gonna have to make your own lane,
'cause you definitely got oncoming traffic

382
00:31:20,841 --> 00:31:22,259
Be careful. Be careful.

- Why?
- 'Cause you're always hoppin' around.

393

And you're kinda cute like a frog,
and... I'd like to jump ya.

395
00:32:19,399 --> 00:32:24,571
Nobody makes Sheriff Buford T. Justice
look like a possum's pecker.

396
00:32:24,738 --> 00:32:27,866
- Except for that...
- Shut your ass.

00:32:31,953 --> 00:32:35,707
- Break for that Bandit One.
- Yeah, Snowman, come on back.

399
00:32:35,874 --> 00:32:38,210
That was a Texas bubblegum machine
on your back door.

400
00:32:38,377 --> 00:32:41,963
- A Texas bubblegum machine?
- Yeah, I saw him.

401
00:32:54,267 --> 00:32:58,980
You ain't gonna believe this, but that crazy
sombitch tried to drive up under my truck.

doing in Arkansas?

- Well, who the hell knows?
- I really don't know.

406
00:33:13,745 --> 00:33:20,252
What we're dealin' with here is
a complete lack of respect for the law.

407
00:33:21,086 --> 00:33:24,840
(JUSTICE ON RADIO)
This is Sheriff Buford T. Justice.

408
00:33:25,006 --> 00:33:28,343
I'm in pursuit of a black TransAm.

409
00:33:28,552 --> 00:33:33,056
He's all mine, so stay outta the way.

410
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:44,651
This is Sheriff George Branford
of Deeson County, Arkansas.

411
00:33:44,818 --> 00:33:48,071
We are apprised of the situation
and are taking appropriate measures.

412
00:33:48,238 --> 00:33:49,823
Did you say you are a sheriff?

of Texasl

415
00:33:57,581 --> 00:34:01,209
Texas? You know, of course,
that you're out of yourjurisdiction.

416
00:34:01,376 --> 00:34:03,754
I suggest that you let my department
handle the situation.

417
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:08,717
That's very comfortin',
but I'm in a high-speed pursuit.

418
00:34:08,884 --> 00:34:11,720
- Don't you hear good?
- I hear perfectly.

419
00:34:11,887 --> 00:34:14,598
The fact that you are a sheriff
is not germane to the situation.

420
00:34:14,723 --> 00:34:18,393

got nothin' to do with itl

You ain't gonna believe this,

How'd ya do, same as always?

Yeah, about normal. I lost.

- That's a big 10-4.

839
01:12:53,416 --> 01:12:57,629
Actually, my heaviest relationship
was with an acid-rock singer...

840
01:12:57,796 --> 01:12:59,464
named Robert Crumly.

841
01:12:59,631 --> 01:13:05,304
We were together... eight and a half days.
God, I really thought that was it.

01:13:05,470 --> 01:13:06,930
And?

...with a girl...
and her motherl

845
01:13:13,645 --> 01:13:17,274
Well, at least
he kept it in the family.

846
01:13:25,240 --> 01:13:28,118
You have a wonderful way
of putting things.

847
01:13:28,285 --> 01:13:31,371

I need a smokey report,
and I need it bad, son.

851
01:13:44,885 --> 01:13:48,764
This is Foxy Lady, Bandit.
We heard you were comin' by,

852
01:13:48,972 --> 01:13:51,683
and we decided we'd take care
of those bears for you.

853
01:13:51,850 --> 01:13:56,897
- You know, a little "personalised service".
- Send me the bill, Foxy Lady.

854
01:13:57,105 --> 01:14:00,442
Better yet, why don't you
come by and pay up in person?

I'm too pooped to pop.

- Daddy, listen.
- Shut upl

01:14:12,788 --> 01:14:14,790
All right you talked me into it.

860
01:14:14,957 --> 01:14:19,336
Now I got that sombitch,
and I got him with his fly open.

861
01:14:21,421 --> 01:14:25,884
- What do we do when we get home?
- Go to bed. For a week.

862
01:14:26,051 --> 01:14:28,261
Good idea.

863
01:14:28,428 --> 01:14:32,641
- And sleep.
- Wanna bet?

at the diner, Arlene?

865
01:14:37,229 --> 01:14:40,982
- She's got some nice legs.
- I'd like to take a run on her.

866
01:14:41,191 --> 01:14:43,735
- Oh, man, what are you talkin' about?
- I'm tellin' ya.

- Let's get him.

slide right into your convoy there?

Come ahead, Bandit. We'll slip you into
the rockin' chair, play a little hide-and-seek.

those trucks, darlin'. Spot those beavers.
