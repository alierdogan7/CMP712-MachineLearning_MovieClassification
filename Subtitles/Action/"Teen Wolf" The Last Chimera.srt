- Yeah, I do, too.

Hey, Stiles, get him out of here.

Go to the hospital. Figure
out a way to save your dad.

536

We're not gonna be able to stop them.

537
00:33:43,577 --> 00:33:45,043
But we can slow them down.

538

Scott, we're gonna die down here.

542

No, we're not.

543
00:34:13,106 --> 00:34:14,239
How can you be so sure?

544
00:34:14,274 --> 00:34:16,107
Because you're not the
only one that I called.

545

Run.

549
00:34:58,368 --> 00:34:59,901
Step back. I think I can break through it.

550
00:34:59,953 --> 00:35:02,987
It's just sometimes, most
of the time, I lose control.

551
00:35:02,989 --> 00:35:04,155
So you better step back.

What?

560
00:35:45,699 --> 00:35:47,365
There's something inside him.
Something that we didn't see.

561
00:35:47,417 --> 00:35:49,417
- Melissa, we can't just open him up.
- It's a piece of bone.

562
00:35:49,452 --> 00:35:51,669
He's being poisoned by bone marrow.

I know it doesn't make any
sense, I know what it sounds like,

564
00:35:54,374 --> 00:35:56,341
but you have to open him up.

565
00:35:56,376 --> 00:35:57,542

A symbol.

589

The symbol of an Alpha and his pack.

Whose pack?

591
00:39:15,325 --> 00:39:16,407
Scott's.

DR. VALACK: It was more
than a symbol, wasn't it?

593
