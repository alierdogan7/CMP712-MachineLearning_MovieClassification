What I read
in the newspaper, sir.

71

Then you'll know
that Moonraker,
the space shuttle,

Yes, which crashed

totally destroyed,
correct?

That's the official version.

more disturbing,007.

00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:11,661
Are you suggesting
the shuttle was

That's for you
to find out,007.

Yes. We were responsible
for the safety of that
shuttle, Commander.

is justifiably concerned.

90
00:10:26,802 --> 00:10:29,220

for you.

right sleeve, will you?

99
00:10:48,866 --> 00:10:51,785

as standard equipment.

100

Strap it on your wrist.

101
00:10:58,084 --> 00:11:01,461
It's activated
by nerve impulses
from the wrist muscles.

102
00:11:01,545 --> 00:11:02,879

103
00:11:05,257 --> 00:11:07,759
Oh, thank you,007.

Be careful, will you?
Yes, Q.

in the stores for Christmas.

118
00:12:16,704 --> 00:12:17,996
Owns a lot, doesn't he?

119
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:19,956
What he doesn't own,
he doesn't want.

120
00:12:25,087 --> 00:12:27,755
We're approaching
the main complex now.

121
00:12:29,925 --> 00:12:31,676
BOND: That's where
the Moonraker shuttle
is made?

122
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:34,679
That's right,
workshops, hangars,

123
00:12:34,763 --> 00:12:38,892
design and
experimental blocks,
test centers, everything.

124
00:12:38,976 --> 00:12:40,435

125
00:12:50,863 --> 00:12:54,782
I'd heard that
Hugo Drax is obsessed
with the conquest of space.

126

Magnificent.

132
00:13:15,804 --> 00:13:17,555
Why didn't he buy
the Eiffel Tower as well?

133
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:21,267
He did, but the French
government refused him
an export permit.

134
00:13:38,702 --> 00:13:39,827
Look there.

135
00:13:39,912 --> 00:13:41,788

Well, my dear fellow,
your reputation
precedes you, of course.

150
00:15:20,387 --> 00:15:22,180
I'm honored that
your government
should send you

151
00:15:22,264 --> 00:15:23,931
on so delicate a mission.

152
00:15:24,850 --> 00:15:26,267
Delicate, Mr. Drax?

153
00:15:26,352 --> 00:15:30,313
Well, to apologize
in person for the loss
of my space shuttle.

154
00:15:31,774 --> 00:15:35,234
How would Oscar Wilde
have put it?

157
00:15:47,081 --> 00:15:51,125
Well, an apology will be made
to the American government,
Mr. Drax,

158
00:15:51,210 --> 00:15:53,795
when we've discovered
why there was no trace
of the Moonraker

159
00:15:53,879 --> 00:15:55,338
in that wreckage.

160
00:15:55,422 --> 00:15:58,633
DRAX: And your loyalty
commands respect, Mr. Bond.

161
00:16:00,886 --> 00:16:03,638
You have arrived
at a propitious moment,

162
00:16:03,722 --> 00:16:07,058

one indisputable contribution

163

to Western civilization.

May I press you to

Thank you, no,
nothing at all.

167
00:16:17,528 --> 00:16:20,363
The shuttle, is it made
entirely here in California?

168
00:16:20,447 --> 00:16:23,074
No. I own a number
of subsidiaries
throughout the world,

169
00:16:23,158 --> 00:16:24,909
producing components.

170
00:16:24,993 --> 00:16:27,328
The conquest of space
represents an investment

171
00:16:27,413 --> 00:16:30,581
in the future of the entire
human race, Mr. Bond.

172
00:16:31,375 --> 00:16:32,959
It is, therefore,
logical to seek out

173

the best that each
nation has to offer.

174
00:16:36,964 --> 00:16:39,799
Are you referring
to people or skills?

175
00:16:40,717 --> 00:16:43,553
Both, Mr. Bond.

176
00:16:52,354 --> 00:16:54,063
Am I too soon?

177
00:16:54,148 --> 00:16:55,982
Not at all.

is eager to start his tour.

179

180

who will show you around.

Look after Mr. Bond.

185
00:17:22,342 --> 00:17:25,219
See that some harm
comes to him.

186
00:17:28,974 --> 00:17:31,517

first on the right.

187

190

191
00:18:01,340 --> 00:18:02,465
Can I help you?

192
00:18:02,549 --> 00:18:04,884
Yes. My name is Bond.
James Bond.

193
00:18:04,968 --> 00:18:06,636
I'm looking for Dr. Goodhead.

194
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,429
You just found her.

195
00:18:09,598 --> 00:18:11,349
A woman.

196
00:18:11,433 --> 00:18:15,228
Your powers of observation
do you credit, Mr. Bond.

197
00:18:15,312 --> 00:18:17,271
James, to my friends.

198
00:18:18,190 --> 00:18:19,774
Holly Goodhead.

199
00:18:20,734 --> 00:18:22,818
Are you training
to be an astronaut?

200
00:18:23,403 --> 00:18:25,071
I'm fully trained.

201
00:18:25,155 --> 00:18:28,199
On loan from NASA,
the Space Administration.

202
00:18:29,785 --> 00:18:32,870
Well, Mr. Bond,
I guess we'd
better get started.

203
00:18:32,955 --> 00:18:37,166
You don't want to lose time
as well as a space shuttle,
do you?

204
00:18:44,591 --> 00:18:46,592
This is it,
the Moonraker.

205
00:18:46,677 --> 00:18:49,095
Capable of being launched
into space by rocket...

206
00:18:49,179 --> 00:18:51,389
Orbiting the Earth
and reentering
the atmosphere to land

207
00:18:51,473 --> 00:18:53,849
like any conventional
aircraft.

208
00:19:00,065 --> 00:19:03,067
GOODHEAD: This is
the centrifuge training.

209
00:19:03,151 --> 00:19:07,780
BOND: It simulates
the gravity force you feel
when shot into space.

210
00:19:12,578 --> 00:19:15,830
The speed is controlled by
the instructor from up there.

211
00:19:15,914 --> 00:19:17,999
Why not try it?

212
00:19:19,543 --> 00:19:21,502
Why not?

213
00:19:27,509 --> 00:19:29,510
Strap yourself in firmly.

214
00:19:30,554 --> 00:19:32,555
Yes, Doctor.

215
00:19:33,181 --> 00:19:35,725
Now your arms.

216
00:19:35,809 --> 00:19:38,269
That's to prevent you
from knocking yourself out.

217
00:19:38,353 --> 00:19:39,645
BOND: I see.

218
00:19:46,737 --> 00:19:49,822
How fast does it go?

219
00:19:51,033 --> 00:19:54,118
It can go up to 20 Gs,
but that would be fatal.

220
00:19:54,202 --> 00:19:56,954
Three Gs is equivalent
to take-off pressure.

221
00:19:57,039 --> 00:20:00,041
Most people
pass out at seven.

222
00:20:00,125 --> 00:20:02,627
You make a great saleswoman.

223
00:20:02,711 --> 00:20:06,756
You don't have to worry.
This is what we call
a "Chicken Switch. "

224
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:08,924
You just keep your
finger on that button,

225
00:20:09,009 --> 00:20:11,469
the moment the pressure
gets too much for you,
release the button

226
00:20:11,553 --> 00:20:13,012
and the power's cut off.

227
00:20:13,138 --> 00:20:14,138
Just like that?

229
00:20:15,349 --> 00:20:16,807
Come on, Mr. Bond.

230
00:20:16,892 --> 00:20:19,018
A 70-year-old
can take 3 Gs.

231
00:20:19,519 --> 00:20:23,522
Well, the trouble is
there is never a 70-year-old
around when you need one.

232
00:20:30,113 --> 00:20:31,155
GOODHEAD: You want me?

233
00:20:31,239 --> 00:20:32,907
Mr. Drax says
to telephone him.

234
00:20:32,991 --> 00:20:34,992
All right,
I'll call him
from my office.

235
00:20:35,077 --> 00:20:37,912
You go ahead.
I'll be right back.

236
00:20:38,789 --> 00:20:41,457

supervise the session.

Yes. We're taking
good care of him.

239

I don't know what
could've happened.

240

gone wrong with

a list of things
not to do on a first date.

243

244
00:24:25,307 --> 00:24:26,974
That's not what I came for.

245
00:24:27,058 --> 00:24:30,144
No. What do you want then?

246
00:24:32,731 --> 00:24:37,443

be shattered if I were
to say information?

247

tell you anything?

248
00:24:39,696 --> 00:24:41,780

a great deal, Mr. Bond.

of Moonraker?

happening now.
