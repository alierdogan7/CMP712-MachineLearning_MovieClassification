I am locutus of borg.

Catch you at a bad time,

10
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:18,340
No, of course not.

11
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:19,980
I've just received
a disturbing report

12
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:21,340
From deep space 5.

13
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:24,820
Our colony on ivor prime
was destroyed this morning.

14
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:26,580
Long-range sensors
have picked up--

15
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:28,260
Yes, I know.

The borg.

00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:36,140
Picard: captain's log,
stardate 50893.5.

18
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:39,180
The moment I have dreaded
for nearly 6 years

19
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:40,580
Has finally arrived.

20
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:43,740
The borg,
our most lethal enemy,

21
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:46,180
Have begun an invasion
of the federation,

22
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:50,660
And this time, there may be
no stopping them.

23
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:51,820
How many ships?

24
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:53,900
One, and it's on
a direct course for earth.

25
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:56,380
They will cross the federation
border in less than an hour.

26
00:04:56,420 --> 00:04:59,340
Admiral hayes is mobilizing
a fleet in the typhon sector.

27
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:00,420
At maximum warp,

28
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:01,740
It will take us
3 hours, 25 minutes--

29
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:03,300
We're not going.

30
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:04,900
What do you mean
we're not going?

31
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:07,580
Our orders are to patrol
the neutral zone

32
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:08,900
In case the romulans

33
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:10,860
Decide to take advantage
of the situation.

34
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:12,140
The romulans?

35
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:14,140
Captain, there has been
no unusual activity

36
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:16,460
Along the romulan border
for the last 9 months.

37
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:17,900
It seems highly unlikely
they would choose

38
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:19,620
This moment
to start a conflict.

39
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:20,580
Does starfleet
feel

40
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:22,020
We need more
shakedown time?

41
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:24,420
We've been out in space
nearly a year now.

42
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:26,340
We're ready.

43
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:27,460

44
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:28,740
Is the most advanced

45
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:30,020
We should be
on the front line.

46
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:32,700
I have gone over all this
with starfleet command.

47
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:34,620
Their orders stand.

48
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:42,580
Number one, set a course
for the neutral zone.

49
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:55,660

00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:15,540

00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:16,900
Berlioz.

52
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:18,820
What do you have?

53
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:20,740
We finished
our first sensor sweep

54
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:21,700
Of the neutral zone.

55
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:23,820
Oh, fascinating.

56
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:26,580
20 particles of space dust

00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:29,540
52 ultraviolet
radiation spikes,

58
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:30,940
And a class-2 comet.

59
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:33,940
Well, this is certainly
worthy of our attention.

60
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:38,020
Captain, why are we
out here chasing comets?

61
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:42,100
Let's just say starfleet
has every confidence

62
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:43,500
<i>In the enterprise
and her crew.</i>

63
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:45,300
They're just not sure
about her captain.

64
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:49,340
They believe that a man
who was once captured

65
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:51,020
And assimilated by the borg

66
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:52,740
Should not be
put in a situation

67
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:54,500
Where he would
face them again.

68
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:59,940
To do so would introduce
an unstable element

69
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:01,540
Into a critical situation.

70
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:03,180
That's ridiculous.

71
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:04,540
Your experience
with the borg

72
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:06,460
Makes you the perfect
man to lead this fight.

73
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:08,500
Admiral hayes disagrees.

and surrender your ships.

distinctiveness to our own.

A direct violation
of our orders.

112
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:31,340
Any of you who wish to
object should do so now.

113
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:33,140
It will be noted
in my log.

114
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:39,780
Captain, I believe I speak
for everyone here, sir,

115
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:40,940

116
00:08:43,180 --> 00:08:45,220
To hell with our orders.

117
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:52,180
Red alert. All hands
to battle stations.

118
00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:54,500

00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:39,140
Perhaps today
is a good day to die.

125
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:41,940
Prepare for ramming speed.

Mr. Worf, we could use

00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:52,220
They must've done it

180
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:54,020
They went back

Changed history.

00:12:55,940 --> 00:12:57,540
But if they changed history,
why are we still here?

183
00:12:57,620 --> 00:13:00,420
The temporal wake
must have somehow protected us

00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:01,780
From changes
in the time line.

185
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:04,220
[beeping]

186
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:05,860
Sir, the vortex
is collapsing.

187
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:07,780
Hold your course,
mr. Hawk.

188
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:09,900
We must
follow them back,

189
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:12,420
Repair whatever damage
they've done.

190
00:13:41,580 --> 00:13:42,980
Come on.

191
00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:44,700
Good night, eddy.

192
00:13:45,780 --> 00:13:47,260
Go home.

193
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:51,300
You're gonna
regret this tomorrow.

194
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:53,020
One of the things

195
00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:54,820
You should've learned
about me by now...

196
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:57,020
Is that I don't
have regrets.

197
00:13:57,060 --> 00:13:59,980
Come on, lily.
One more round.

198
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:01,380
Z, you've had enough.

199
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:03,820
I'm not going up in that thing
with a drunken pilot.

200
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:08,100
I sure as hell am not
going up there sober.

201
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:09,900
What is that?

202
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:14,740
That...Is
the constellation leo.

203
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:17,140
No. That.

204
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:26,660
It's an econ.

205
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:28,260
After all these years?

206
00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:36,540
<i>We gotta get
to the phoenix.</i>

207
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:43,580
<i>To hell with the phoenix.</i>

208
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:45,420
Aah!

209
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:47,060
Man: help! Help! Hurry!

210
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:50,220
Come on. Move. This way.

211
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:51,260
Run!

212
00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:57,060
Aah!

213
00:15:03,780 --> 00:15:05,380
Report.

214
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:06,540
Shields are down.

215
00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:07,740
Long-range sensors
are off-line.

216
00:15:07,780 --> 00:15:08,820
Main power's holding.

217
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:10,180
According to our
astrometric readings,

218
00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:12,260
We are in
the mid-21st century.

219
00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:13,580
From
the radioactive isotopes

220
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:14,700
In the atmosphere,

221
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:16,460
I would estimate
we have arrived

222
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:18,380
Approximately 10 years
after the third world war.

223
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:19,940
Makes sense.

224
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:21,580
Most of the major cities
have been destroyed.

225
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:24,740
Very few governments left.
600 million dead.

226
00:15:24,780 --> 00:15:25,860
No resistance.

227
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:27,340
Worf: captain...

228
00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:31,940
Mr. Worf,
quantum torpedoes.

229
00:15:32,020 --> 00:15:32,940
Ready, sir.

230
00:15:33,020 --> 00:15:34,100
Fire.

231
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:47,940
They were firing
at the surface.

232
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:49,100
Location?

233
00:15:50,060 --> 00:15:51,220
Western hemisphere.

234
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:52,700
North american
continent.

235
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:54,340
Looks like
a missile complex

236
00:15:54,380 --> 00:15:56,060
In central montana.

237
00:15:57,020 --> 00:15:58,860
Missile complex...

238
00:15:58,940 --> 00:16:00,580
The date? Data,

239
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:03,340
I need to know
the exact date.

240
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:06,700
April 4th...2063?

241
00:16:06,780 --> 00:16:09,820
April 4th. The day before
first contact.

242
00:16:09,860 --> 00:16:11,060
Precisely.

243
00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:12,420
Crusher: then
the missile complex

244
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:13,460
Must be where
zefram cochrane

245
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:14,860
Is building
his warp ship.

246
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:16,540
That's what
they came here to do--

247
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:17,900
Stop first contact.

248
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:19,820
How much damage,
lieutenant?

249
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:20,900
Can't tell.

250
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:22,180
Long-range sensors
are still off-line.

251
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:23,980
We have to go down there,
find out what happened.

252
00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:25,700
Data, beverly,
you're with me.

253
00:16:25,780 --> 00:16:28,620
Have a security team meet us
in transporter room 3.

254
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:32,060
Computer, mid-21st century
civilian clothing.

255
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:33,100
Number one...

256
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:34,900
You have the bridge.

257
00:16:44,020 --> 00:16:45,740
Over here.

258
00:17:08,580 --> 00:17:10,180
They're all dead.

259
00:17:15,060 --> 00:17:17,780
See if one of them
is cochrane.

260
00:17:17,860 --> 00:17:20,540
Data, let's go check
the warp ship.

261
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:42,660
The structural integrity
of the missile

262
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:43,940
Appears to be intact,

263
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:45,220
But there is
significant damage

264
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:46,780
To various sections
of the fuselage

265
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:48,540
And primary
intercooler system.

266
00:17:48,580 --> 00:17:50,660
You should have
the original blueprints

267
00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:52,140
<i>In the enterprise computer.</i>

268
00:17:52,220 --> 00:17:55,380
Commander la forge will need
to bring a team down here.

269
00:17:55,460 --> 00:17:57,900
Hold your fire!!
We're here to help you!

270
00:17:57,980 --> 00:17:59,300
Bullshit!

271
00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:02,940
Captain...

272
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:05,700
I believe
I can handle this.

273
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:26,100
[gun cocks]

274
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:28,580
Greetings.

275
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:40,580
Captain, this woman
requires medical attention.

276
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:47,580
Severe theta
radiation poisoning.

277
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:49,180
The radiation
is coming from

278
00:18:49,220 --> 00:18:50,460
The damaged
throttle assembly.

279
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:52,020
We are all going to have
to be inoculated,

280
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:53,940
And I have to get her
to sick bay.

281
00:18:54,020 --> 00:18:55,140
Doctor...

282
00:18:55,220 --> 00:18:56,660
Please, no lectures about
the prime directive.

283
00:18:56,740 --> 00:18:57,860
I will keep her
unconscious.

284
00:18:57,940 --> 00:18:59,780
Very well.
Tell commander riker

285
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:01,140
To beam down with
a search party.

286
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:03,140
We need to find
cochrane.

287
00:19:03,220 --> 00:19:04,140
<i>Crusher to enterprise--</i>

288
00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:07,260
2 to beam directly
to sick bay.

289
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:13,180
We have less
than 48 hours

290
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:14,940
Before this ship
has to be launched.

291
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:15,900
Picard to engineering.

292
00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:17,180
La forge here.

293
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:18,780
Geordi, cochrane's ship
was damaged in the attack.

294
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:20,540
Get down here with
an engineering detail.

295
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:21,740
We have work to do.

296
00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:24,340
Right.
I'm on my way, captain.

297
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:26,780
Alpha team, let's assemble
in transporter room 3.

298
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:28,100
We're heading down
to the surface.

299
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:30,620
Porter, you're gonna be
in command till I get back.

300
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:31,580
Aye, sir.

301
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:32,780
And, porter,

302
00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:34,380
Check out
the environmental controls

303
00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:35,580
While I'm gone.

304
00:19:35,620 --> 00:19:36,860
It's getting
a little warm in here.

305
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:38,020
All right, let's go.

306
00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:56,460
Isn't it amazing?

307
00:19:58,420 --> 00:20:01,860
This ship used to be
a nuclear missile.

308
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:04,900
It is historical irony
that dr. Cochrane

309
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:06,820
Would choose an instrument
of mass destruction

310
00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:09,260
To inaugurate
an era of peace.

311
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:22,300
It's a boyhood fantasy,
data.

312
00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:23,740
I must have seen this ship

313
00:20:23,780 --> 00:20:25,900
Hundreds of times
in the smithsonian,

314
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:28,220
But I was never able
to touch it.

315
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:30,660
Sir, does
tactile contact

316
00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:32,900
<i>Alter your perception
of the phoenix?</i>

317
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:34,140
Oh, yes.

318
00:20:34,180 --> 00:20:37,300
For humans, touch can
connect you to an object

319
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:41,460
In a very personal way,
make it seem more real.

320
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:51,260
I'm detecting imperfections
in the titanium casing...

321
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:55,420
Temperature variations
in the fuel manifold.

322
00:20:55,460 --> 00:20:58,420
It is no more
real to me now

323
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:00,740
Than it was
a moment ago.

324
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:03,220
Would you three
like to be alone?

325
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:05,180
What have you found out?

326
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:08,100
There's no sign of cochrane
anywhere in the complex.

327
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:09,500
He has to be here.

328
00:21:09,540 --> 00:21:10,980
There was nothing
more important to him

329
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:12,100
Than this ship.

330
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:13,940
This flight--
it was his dream.

331
00:21:14,020 --> 00:21:16,100
Captain, we should
consider the possibility

332
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:18,660
That dr. Cochrane
was killed in the attack.

333
00:21:18,740 --> 00:21:20,860
[sighs heavily]

334
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:22,820
If that's true...

335
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:26,820
Then the future
may die with him.

336
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:34,500
What do you think?

337
00:21:34,540 --> 00:21:36,100
It's like the entire
environmental system's

338
00:21:36,140 --> 00:21:37,380
Gone crazy.

339
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:38,660
It's not
just engineering.

340
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:39,940
It's the entire deck.

341
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:42,820
Maybe it's a problem
with the e.P.S. Conduits.

342
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:51,140
Hello?

343
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:53,020
Hey...

344
00:21:53,060 --> 00:21:55,460
Eiger: are you
talking to me?

345
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:57,380
Is there anyone else
working maintenance

346
00:21:57,420 --> 00:21:58,700
In this section?

347
00:21:58,780 --> 00:22:00,980
Eiger: uh...
Not that I know of.

348
00:22:04,540 --> 00:22:07,460
[zap] aah. Aah!

349
00:22:11,340 --> 00:22:12,660
Paul?

350
00:22:17,060 --> 00:22:18,460
Paul?

351
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:22,340
Are you ok in there?

352
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:31,780
Aah!

353
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:34,100
[sound of borg]

354
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:39,660
Captain? What is it?

355
00:22:42,860 --> 00:22:44,020
<i>Picard to enterprise--</i>

356
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:46,180
Mr. Worf, is everything
all right up there?

357
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:49,140
Yes, sir. We are experiencing
some environmental difficulties

358
00:22:49,220 --> 00:22:50,740
On deck 16,
but that is all.

359
00:22:50,820 --> 00:22:52,340
What kind
of difficulties?

360
00:22:52,420 --> 00:22:54,660
Humidity levels
have risen 73%,

361
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:56,180
And the temperature

362
00:22:56,260 --> 00:22:58,260
Has jumped 10 degrees
in the last hour.

363
00:22:58,340 --> 00:23:00,020
Mr. Data and I are
returning to the ship.

364
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:01,060

to run another test

370
00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:10,820
On her spinal tissue,

371
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:13,220
And find out why
it's so hot in here.

372
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:14,900
Now what?

373
00:23:14,980 --> 00:23:16,500

374
00:23:18,580 --> 00:23:19,940

376
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:22,340
Commander worf,

377
00:23:22,420 --> 00:23:24,540
I need to know exactly
what's been happening.

378
00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:26,340
We just lost contact
with deck 16--

379
00:23:26,420 --> 00:23:28,660
Communications,
internal sensors, everything.

380
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:30,900
I was about to send
a security team to investigate.

381
00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:32,740
No. Seal off deck 16.

382
00:23:32,780 --> 00:23:34,380
Post security teams
at every access point.

383
00:23:34,460 --> 00:23:35,540
Aye, sir.

384
00:23:35,620 --> 00:23:37,260
Mr. Hawk, before we lost
internal sensors,

385
00:23:37,340 --> 00:23:38,980
What were the exact
environmental conditions

386
00:23:39,060 --> 00:23:40,340
In main engineering?

387
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:42,020
Atmospheric pressure was 2
kilopasquals above normal--

388
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:44,940
92% humidity,
39.1 degrees celsius.

389
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:47,660
39.1 degrees celsius...

390
00:23:47,740 --> 00:23:49,860
Like a borg ship.

391
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:52,300
They knew their ship
was doomed.

392
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:53,860
Our shields were down,

393
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:56,300
And somehow they
transported over here

394
00:23:56,380 --> 00:23:57,980
Without being detected.

395
00:23:58,020 --> 00:24:00,860
<i>They'll assimilate

396
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:02,980

403
00:24:19,180 --> 00:24:22,020
Weapons, shields,

404
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:24,500
Quickly. Mr. Data,
lock out the main computer.

405
00:24:31,940 --> 00:24:33,780
I have isolated
the main computer

406
00:24:33,860 --> 00:24:35,100
With a fractal
encryption code.

407
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:36,380
It is highly unlikely

408
00:24:36,420 --> 00:24:37,780
The borg will be able
to break it.

409
00:24:37,860 --> 00:24:41,980
The borg have cut primary power
to all decks except 16.

410
00:24:42,020 --> 00:24:45,540
The borg won't stay
on deck 16.

411
00:24:46,780 --> 00:24:48,380
Wake up. You're all right.

412
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:51,060
Come on. Come on. Wake up.

413
00:24:51,140 --> 00:24:52,100
Hmm...

414
00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:53,380
Whoa, take it easy.
Stay calm.

415
00:24:53,420 --> 00:24:54,860
You are all right.
Now listen to me.

416
00:24:54,940 --> 00:24:56,100
You are
going to be fine.

417
00:24:56,180 --> 00:24:57,380
I need you
to do as I say.

418
00:24:57,460 --> 00:25:00,780
Alyssa...Is the e.M.H.
Program still on-line?

419
00:25:00,860 --> 00:25:01,860
It should be.

420
00:25:01,940 --> 00:25:03,620
Take it easy. That's it.
That's a girl.

421
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:04,780
I swore I'd never
use one of these.

422
00:25:04,860 --> 00:25:06,660
Computer, activate
the e.M.H. Program.

423
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:09,900
Please state the nature
of the medical emergency.

424
00:25:09,980 --> 00:25:11,740
20 borg are about
to break through that door.

425
00:25:11,780 --> 00:25:14,500
We need time to get out of here.
Create a diversion.

426
00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:16,300
This isn't
part of my program.

427
00:25:16,380 --> 00:25:18,420
I'm a doctor,
not a doorstop.

428
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:20,980
Do a dance, tell a story--
I don't care.

429
00:25:21,060 --> 00:25:22,740
Just give us a few seconds.

430
00:25:22,820 --> 00:25:24,180
[pounding]

431
00:25:28,940 --> 00:25:31,220
According to starfleet
medical research,

432
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:35,300
Borg implants can cause
severe skin irritations.

433
00:25:35,340 --> 00:25:38,460
Perhaps you'd like...
An analgesic cream?

434
00:25:43,780 --> 00:25:45,220
Which way?

435
00:25:45,260 --> 00:25:47,580
We need to get off
this deck.

436
00:25:47,620 --> 00:25:49,060
Follow me.

437
00:26:01,620 --> 00:26:03,940
First thing they'll do
in engineering

438
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:05,740
Is establish a collective--

439
00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:07,420
A central point from which
they can control the hive.

440
00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:09,540
The problem is,
if we begin firing

441
00:26:09,620 --> 00:26:11,500
Particle weapons
in engineering,

442
00:26:11,580 --> 00:26:13,740
There's a risk
we may hit the warp core.

443
00:26:16,420 --> 00:26:18,780
I believe our goal should be

444
00:26:18,820 --> 00:26:19,940
To puncture one of
the plasma coolant tanks.

445
00:26:19,980 --> 00:26:21,020
Data?

446
00:26:21,060 --> 00:26:21,980
Excellent idea.

447
00:26:22,020 --> 00:26:23,380
Plasma coolant
will liquefy

448
00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:24,980
Organic material
on contact.

449
00:26:25,060 --> 00:26:27,740
But the borg are not
entirely organic.

450
00:26:27,780 --> 00:26:29,700
True, but like all
cybernetic life forms,

451
00:26:29,740 --> 00:26:32,060
They cannot survive without
their organic components.

452
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:34,420
I have ordered
all weapons to be set

453
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:36,660
On a rotating
modulation.

454
00:26:36,740 --> 00:26:38,340
The borg
will adapt quickly.

455
00:26:38,420 --> 00:26:40,740
We will be able to fire
12 shots at most.

456
00:26:40,820 --> 00:26:42,140
One other thing--

457
00:26:43,460 --> 00:26:46,460
<i>You may encounter
enterprise crew members</i>

458
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:47,740

been assimilated.

459
00:26:47,780 --> 00:26:49,500
Don't hesitate to fire.

460
00:26:49,540 --> 00:26:53,580

doing them a favor.

00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:15,780
Lower your weapons.

547
00:32:15,860 --> 00:32:18,540
They'll ignore us till
they consider us a threat.

548
00:33:01,180 --> 00:33:03,700
Picard: the
manual release.

549
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:07,300
Mr. Worf, hold
this position.

550
00:33:12,940 --> 00:33:15,380
Computer: manual release
is on-line.

551
00:33:23,060 --> 00:33:24,980
Perhaps we should
just knock.

552
00:33:28,260 --> 00:33:29,220
Data.

553
00:33:41,380 --> 00:33:42,420
Ready phasers!

554
00:33:55,860 --> 00:33:58,060
Data, cover me.

555
00:34:05,820 --> 00:34:07,900
Captain, they've adapted!

556
00:34:18,260 --> 00:34:19,460
Picard: aah!

557
00:34:43,780 --> 00:34:45,540
Regroup on deck 15.

558
00:34:45,620 --> 00:34:47,540
Don't let them
touch you!

559
00:34:50,020 --> 00:34:50,980
Captain!

560
00:34:52,540 --> 00:34:53,500
Data!

561
00:35:08,860 --> 00:35:09,820
Uhh!

562
00:35:12,220 --> 00:35:13,180
Here!

563
00:35:16,300 --> 00:35:18,180
Crewman: captain?

564
00:35:18,220 --> 00:35:19,820
Help.

565
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:24,780
Please, help.

566
00:35:38,820 --> 00:35:40,100
Aah!

567
00:35:42,820 --> 00:35:43,740
You!

568
00:35:43,780 --> 00:35:44,700
How the hell did you--

569
00:35:44,740 --> 00:35:45,660
Back off!

570
00:35:45,700 --> 00:35:46,620
Calm down!

571
00:35:46,660 --> 00:35:47,580
Shut up!

572
00:35:47,620 --> 00:35:48,900
Who are you?

573
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:50,180
My name is
jean-luc picard.

574
00:35:50,220 --> 00:35:51,620
No! Who are you with?!

575
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:52,780
What faction?

576
00:35:52,860 --> 00:35:54,500
I'm not a member of
the eastern coalition.

577
00:35:54,580 --> 00:35:55,740
Listen--

578
00:35:55,780 --> 00:35:57,660
I said shut up!
I don't care who you're with.

579
00:35:57,700 --> 00:36:00,540
Get me the hell
out of here. Now!

580
00:36:00,580 --> 00:36:02,060
That isn't going
to be easy.

581
00:36:02,140 --> 00:36:03,580
You better find a way
to make it easy, soldier,

582
00:36:03,620 --> 00:36:04,900
Or I'm gonna start
pushing buttons.

583
00:36:04,940 --> 00:36:06,180
All right!

584
00:36:09,380 --> 00:36:10,700
Follow me.

585
00:36:10,780 --> 00:36:11,780
Slow!

586
00:36:28,060 --> 00:36:31,900
[reactor pulsates]

587
00:36:53,660 --> 00:36:56,460
Your efforts to break
the encryption codes

588
00:36:56,540 --> 00:36:57,940
Will not be successful,

589
00:36:58,020 --> 00:37:00,780
Nor will your attempts
to assimilate me

590
00:37:00,860 --> 00:37:01,740
Into your collective.

591
00:37:01,820 --> 00:37:03,180
Borg queen:
brave words.

592
00:37:03,260 --> 00:37:05,060
I've heard them before

593
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:07,940
From thousands of species
across thousands of worlds

594
00:37:07,980 --> 00:37:10,700
Since long before
you were created.

595
00:37:10,780 --> 00:37:13,740
But now,
they are all borg.

596
00:37:13,820 --> 00:37:15,660
I am unlike
any life form

597
00:37:15,740 --> 00:37:17,100
You have encountered
before.

598
00:37:17,180 --> 00:37:19,980
The codes stored
in my neural net

599
00:37:20,060 --> 00:37:21,300
Cannot be forcibly removed.

600
00:37:21,380 --> 00:37:23,220
You are
an imperfect being

601
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:25,340
Created by
an imperfect being.

602
00:37:25,380 --> 00:37:27,180
Finding your weakness

603
00:37:27,260 --> 00:37:31,740
Is only a matter of time.

604
00:37:31,780 --> 00:37:34,500
[drill whirs]

605
00:37:36,220 --> 00:37:37,540
[laughs]

606
00:37:37,580 --> 00:37:39,460
Let me just make sure

607
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:41,860
<i>That I understand you
correctly, commander.</i>

608
00:37:41,900 --> 00:37:45,340
A group of
cybernetic creatures

609
00:37:45,380 --> 00:37:46,780
From the future

610
00:37:46,820 --> 00:37:48,740
Have traveled back
through time

611
00:37:48,820 --> 00:37:50,980
To enslave
the human race,

612
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:52,300
And you're here
to stop them?

613
00:37:52,380 --> 00:37:53,540
That's right.

614
00:37:53,620 --> 00:37:54,980
Hot damn.

615
00:37:55,020 --> 00:37:56,300
You're heroic.

616
00:37:57,300 --> 00:37:59,620
We're gonna
prove it to you.

617
00:37:59,660 --> 00:38:00,580
Geordi?

618
00:38:00,620 --> 00:38:03,300
There she is.

619
00:38:03,380 --> 00:38:04,340
Beautiful!

620
00:38:05,300 --> 00:38:07,140
All right,
take a look.

621
00:38:07,220 --> 00:38:08,940
Well, well, well.

622
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:11,980
What we got here?

623
00:38:12,060 --> 00:38:14,500
I love a good peep show.

624
00:38:25,740 --> 00:38:27,180
That's a trick.

625
00:38:30,140 --> 00:38:31,500
How'd you do that?

626
00:38:31,580 --> 00:38:33,660
It's your telescope.

627
00:38:33,700 --> 00:38:34,820
That's our ship,

628
00:38:34,860 --> 00:38:35,860
<i>The enterprise.</i>

629
00:38:40,660 --> 00:38:44,900
And, uh, lily's
up there right now?

630
00:38:44,940 --> 00:38:46,220
Troi: that's right.

631
00:38:46,300 --> 00:38:48,100
Can I talk to her?

632
00:38:48,140 --> 00:38:49,220
<i>We've lost contact
with the enterprise.</i>

633
00:38:49,260 --> 00:38:50,340
We don't know why yet.

634
00:38:52,260 --> 00:38:54,500
So what is it
you want me to do?

635
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:55,940
Simple. Conduct
your warp flight

636
00:38:55,980 --> 00:38:57,220
Flight
tomorrow morning

637
00:38:57,260 --> 00:38:58,500
Just as you
planned.

638
00:38:58,540 --> 00:39:00,500
Why tomorrow morning?

639
00:39:03,660 --> 00:39:05,060
Because at 11:00
an alien ship

640
00:39:05,100 --> 00:39:07,940
Will begin
passing through

641
00:39:07,980 --> 00:39:09,340
This solar system.

642
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:12,940
Alien. You mean
extraterrestrials?

643
00:39:13,020 --> 00:39:14,380
More bad guys?

644
00:39:14,460 --> 00:39:15,340
Troi: good guys.

645
00:39:15,420 --> 00:39:16,820
They're on
a survey mission.

646
00:39:16,900 --> 00:39:18,980
They have no
interest in earth.

647
00:39:19,060 --> 00:39:20,220
Too primitive.

648
00:39:20,260 --> 00:39:22,460
Oh.

649
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:23,700
Doctor,
tomorrow morning

650
00:39:23,780 --> 00:39:25,460
When they detect
the warp signature

651
00:39:25,540 --> 00:39:26,580
From your ship

652
00:39:26,660 --> 00:39:28,020
And realize that humans
have discovered

653
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:29,700
How to travel
faster than light,

654
00:39:29,740 --> 00:39:31,700
They decide to alter
their course

655
00:39:31,780 --> 00:39:33,860
And make first contact
with earth right here.

656
00:39:33,940 --> 00:39:34,820
Here?

657
00:39:34,900 --> 00:39:37,060
Uh, actually,
over there.

658
00:39:37,100 --> 00:39:38,580
It is one of
the pivotal moments

659
00:39:38,660 --> 00:39:39,860
In human history,
doctor.

660
00:39:39,940 --> 00:39:41,620
You get to make
first contact

661
00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:43,180
With an alien race
and after you do,

662
00:39:43,260 --> 00:39:45,580
Everything begins
to change.

663
00:39:45,660 --> 00:39:46,980
Your theories
on warp drive

664
00:39:47,060 --> 00:39:49,140
Allow fleets of starships
to be built

665
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:51,460
And mankind to start
exploring the galaxy.

666
00:39:51,540 --> 00:39:53,140
It unites humanity
in a way

667
00:39:53,220 --> 00:39:54,900
That no one ever
thought possible

668
00:39:54,980 --> 00:39:56,020
When they realize

669
00:39:56,100 --> 00:39:57,620
They're not alone
in the universe.

670
00:39:57,700 --> 00:39:58,860
Poverty,
disease, war--

671
00:39:58,940 --> 00:40:02,020
They'll all be gone
within the next 50 years.

672
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:04,500
But unless you make
that warp flight

673
00:40:04,580 --> 00:40:05,900
Tomorrow morning
before 11:15,

674
00:40:05,980 --> 00:40:08,340
None of it
will happen.

675
00:40:08,420 --> 00:40:09,780
And you people,

676
00:40:09,860 --> 00:40:11,940
You're all...
Astronauts

677
00:40:12,020 --> 00:40:14,100
On some kind
of star trek.

678
00:40:14,180 --> 00:40:15,540
Geordi: look, doc,

679
00:40:15,620 --> 00:40:17,700
I know this is a lot
for you to take in,

680
00:40:17,780 --> 00:40:19,460
But we're running
out of time here.

681
00:40:19,540 --> 00:40:21,300
We need your help.

682
00:40:22,620 --> 00:40:24,620
What do you say?

683
00:40:35,660 --> 00:40:37,060
Why not?

684
00:40:48,140 --> 00:40:49,740
[phasers fire]

685
00:41:15,940 --> 00:41:17,380
[click-whir]

686
00:41:34,900 --> 00:41:36,260
It's pretty bad, sir.

687
00:41:36,340 --> 00:41:39,540
It looks like they control
decks 26 up to 11.

688
00:41:39,620 --> 00:41:41,340
But when they took
deck 11,

689
00:41:41,380 --> 00:41:42,780
They--they just stopped.

690
00:41:42,820 --> 00:41:44,060
The borg
have assimilated

691
00:41:44,100 --> 00:41:45,500
More than
half the ship

692
00:41:45,540 --> 00:41:46,780
In a matter
of hours.

693
00:41:46,820 --> 00:41:48,220
Why stop there?

694
00:41:48,260 --> 00:41:49,700
What is on deck 11?

695
00:41:49,780 --> 00:41:51,140
Hydroponics,
stellar cartography,

696
00:41:51,220 --> 00:41:52,100
Deflector control.

697
00:41:52,180 --> 00:41:53,460
No vital system.

698
00:41:53,540 --> 00:41:55,260
They would not
have stopped there

699
00:41:55,300 --> 00:41:57,180
Unless it gave them
a tactical advantage.

700
00:41:57,220 --> 00:41:58,460
Return to your
checkpoints.

701
00:41:58,500 --> 00:41:59,740
Send reports
every 10 minutes.

702
00:41:59,780 --> 00:42:00,820
Officer:
right, sir.

703
00:42:00,900 --> 00:42:02,460
Something must've
happened in sickbay.

704
00:42:02,500 --> 00:42:04,740
Where are dr. Crusher
and the others?

705
00:42:04,820 --> 00:42:06,180
Why did you break
the cease-fire?

706
00:42:06,220 --> 00:42:07,620
We didn't attack you.

707
00:42:07,660 --> 00:42:08,620
Who did?!

708
00:42:12,900 --> 00:42:13,780
There's a--

709
00:42:13,860 --> 00:42:15,580
There's
a new faction

710
00:42:15,620 --> 00:42:17,500
That wants to prevent
your launch tomorrow morning,

711
00:42:17,540 --> 00:42:18,820
But we're here to help you.

712
00:42:18,860 --> 00:42:21,060
This may be difficult
for you to accept,

713
00:42:21,100 --> 00:42:23,460
But you are not
in montana anymore.

714
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:24,700
You're on a ship,

715
00:42:24,740 --> 00:42:27,140
A--a spaceship

716
00:42:27,180 --> 00:42:28,580
Orbiting the earth
at an altitude--

717
00:42:28,660 --> 00:42:31,660
You wanna help me,
get me outta here.

718
00:42:31,740 --> 00:42:33,180
All right.

719
00:42:34,500 --> 00:42:36,380
You want a way out,

720
00:42:36,420 --> 00:42:37,980
Here it is.

721
00:42:40,140 --> 00:42:41,580
Lily: what is this?

722
00:42:46,140 --> 00:42:47,580
Australia,

723
00:42:47,620 --> 00:42:48,540
New guinea,

724
00:42:48,580 --> 00:42:49,900
The solomons.

725
00:42:49,980 --> 00:42:51,340
Montana will be up soon.

726
00:42:51,420 --> 00:42:53,540
But you may want
to hold your breath,

727
00:42:53,580 --> 00:42:55,180
It's a long way down.

728
00:42:55,260 --> 00:42:56,580
Now listen to me,

729
00:42:56,660 --> 00:42:58,060
I'm not your enemy,

730
00:42:58,140 --> 00:42:59,980
And I can get you home.

731
00:43:00,060 --> 00:43:01,900
But first you must
put that weapon down

732
00:43:01,980 --> 00:43:03,180
And trust me.

733
00:43:08,420 --> 00:43:10,300
Jean-luc picard.

734
00:43:10,340 --> 00:43:12,700
My name.

735
00:43:12,740 --> 00:43:13,860
That's my name.

736
00:43:13,900 --> 00:43:15,020
What's yours?

737
00:43:17,660 --> 00:43:18,540
Lily.

738
00:43:18,620 --> 00:43:20,900
Welcome aboard,
lily.

739
00:43:27,460 --> 00:43:29,420
Thank you.

740
00:43:29,500 --> 00:43:30,860
[beeps]

741
00:43:32,420 --> 00:43:33,300
Maximum setting.

742
00:43:33,380 --> 00:43:34,740
If you'd fired this,

743
00:43:34,820 --> 00:43:36,660
You would've
vaporized me.

744
00:43:38,220 --> 00:43:40,300
It's my first ray gun.

745
00:43:56,620 --> 00:43:58,540
There's no glass.

746
00:44:00,340 --> 00:44:01,300
Aah!

747
00:44:02,260 --> 00:44:03,980
Force field.

748
00:44:04,060 --> 00:44:06,340
I've never seen
that kind of technology.

749
00:44:06,420 --> 00:44:08,860
That's because it hasn't
been invented yet.

750
00:44:08,900 --> 00:44:10,020
What?

751
00:44:11,140 --> 00:44:13,940
There's more
I have to tell you.

752
00:44:14,020 --> 00:44:15,300
Come on.

753
00:44:15,380 --> 00:44:16,340
[beep beep]

754
00:44:20,580 --> 00:44:22,500
Borg queen:
are you ready?

755
00:44:23,660 --> 00:44:25,020
Who are you?

756
00:44:25,060 --> 00:44:26,740
I am the borg.

757
00:44:26,820 --> 00:44:28,860
That is a contradiction.

758
00:44:28,900 --> 00:44:29,820
The borg have

759
00:44:29,860 --> 00:44:31,380
A collective
consciousness.

760
00:44:31,460 --> 00:44:33,060
There are no
individuals.

761
00:44:39,780 --> 00:44:41,580
I am the beginning,

762
00:44:41,660 --> 00:44:43,500
The end,

763
00:44:43,580 --> 00:44:46,180
The one who is many.

764
00:44:59,460 --> 00:45:01,380
I am the borg.

765
00:45:02,980 --> 00:45:04,740
Greetings.

766
00:45:06,100 --> 00:45:07,460
I am curious.

767
00:45:07,540 --> 00:45:10,180
Do you control
the borg collective?

768
00:45:10,220 --> 00:45:13,220
You imply a disparity
where none exists.

769
00:45:13,300 --> 00:45:14,660
I am the collective.

770
00:45:14,700 --> 00:45:17,220
Perhaps I should
rephrase the question.

771
00:45:17,260 --> 00:45:18,500
I wish to understand

772
00:45:18,540 --> 00:45:20,140
The organizational
relationships.

773
00:45:20,220 --> 00:45:22,140
Are you their leader?

774
00:45:24,140 --> 00:45:26,260
I bring order to chaos.

775
00:45:28,020 --> 00:45:31,260
An interesting,
if cryptic response.

776
00:45:31,300 --> 00:45:33,860
You are in chaos,
data.

777
00:45:33,940 --> 00:45:35,460
You are
the contradiction.

778
00:45:35,500 --> 00:45:37,980
A machine who wishes
to be human.

779
00:45:38,020 --> 00:45:39,980
Since you seem to know
so much about me,

780
00:45:40,060 --> 00:45:43,140
You must be aware that
I am programmed to evolve...

781
00:45:43,220 --> 00:45:44,660
To better myself.

782
00:45:44,740 --> 00:45:48,100
We, too, are on a quest
to better ourselves.

783
00:45:48,140 --> 00:45:50,940
Evolving toward
a state of perfection.

784
00:45:50,980 --> 00:45:51,900
Forgive me,

785
00:45:51,940 --> 00:45:54,820
But the borg
do not evolve,

786
00:45:54,860 --> 00:45:56,020
They conquer.

787
00:45:56,100 --> 00:45:59,140
By assimilating
other beings

788
00:45:59,220 --> 00:46:00,620
Into our collective,

789
00:46:00,700 --> 00:46:03,460
We are bringing them
closer to perfection.

790
00:46:03,500 --> 00:46:05,980
Somehow...

791
00:46:06,020 --> 00:46:07,780
I question your motives.

792
00:46:07,820 --> 00:46:11,940
That is because
you haven't been properly...

793
00:46:11,980 --> 00:46:14,500
Stimulated yet.

794
00:46:19,460 --> 00:46:23,620
You have reactivated
my emotion chip.

795
00:46:24,620 --> 00:46:25,540
Why?

796
00:46:25,580 --> 00:46:27,580
Don't be frightened.

797
00:46:27,620 --> 00:46:31,060
I am not frightened.

798
00:46:35,740 --> 00:46:38,860
Do you know
what this is, data?

799
00:46:38,940 --> 00:46:40,220
It would appear

800
00:46:40,260 --> 00:46:41,980
You are attempting
to graft organic skin

801
00:46:42,020 --> 00:46:43,940
Onto my endo-skeletal
structure.

802
00:46:43,980 --> 00:46:47,260
What a cold description

803
00:46:47,300 --> 00:46:49,700
For such a beautiful gift.

804
00:46:54,420 --> 00:46:56,780
[blows]

805
00:47:02,500 --> 00:47:05,740
Was that good for you?

806
00:47:05,820 --> 00:47:07,540
Ooh.

807
00:47:12,820 --> 00:47:13,740
How many planets

808
00:47:13,820 --> 00:47:14,860
Are in this
federation?

809
00:47:14,940 --> 00:47:18,580
Over 150 spread across
8,000 light-years.

810
00:47:18,660 --> 00:47:20,260
You must not
get home much.

811
00:47:20,340 --> 00:47:23,180
Actually, I tend to think
of this ship as home.

812
00:47:23,260 --> 00:47:24,900
But if it's earth
you're talking about,

813
00:47:24,980 --> 00:47:26,820
I try to get back
whenever I can.

814
00:47:26,860 --> 00:47:28,100
[beeps]

815
00:47:28,140 --> 00:47:30,980
Good, they haven't broken
the encryption code yet.

816
00:47:31,020 --> 00:47:33,540
Who, those bionic zombies
you told me about? The--

817
00:47:33,620 --> 00:47:35,100
Borg.

818
00:47:35,140 --> 00:47:36,060
Borg?

819
00:47:36,100 --> 00:47:37,460
Sounds swedish.

820
00:47:41,220 --> 00:47:43,940
Lily: how big
is this ship?

821
00:47:44,020 --> 00:47:45,820
There are 24 decks.

822
00:47:47,580 --> 00:47:49,540
Almost 700 meters long.

823
00:47:49,620 --> 00:47:51,500
Lily: it took me
6 months

824
00:47:51,580 --> 00:47:53,100
To scrounge up
enough titanium

825
00:47:53,180 --> 00:47:56,380
Just to build
a 4-meter cockpit.

826
00:47:59,980 --> 00:48:02,420
How much did
this thing cost?

827
00:48:03,380 --> 00:48:05,220
The economics
of the future

828
00:48:05,300 --> 00:48:07,340
Are somewhat
different.

829
00:48:07,420 --> 00:48:08,460
You see,

830
00:48:08,540 --> 00:48:11,660
Money doesn't exist
in the 24th century.

831
00:48:11,740 --> 00:48:13,820
No money?

832
00:48:13,860 --> 00:48:15,500
[whispers] you mean you
don't get paid?

833
00:48:15,580 --> 00:48:17,180
The acquisition
of wealth

834
00:48:17,220 --> 00:48:19,100
Is no longer
the driving force

835
00:48:19,140 --> 00:48:20,900
In our lives.

836
00:48:20,980 --> 00:48:24,180
We work
to better ourselves

837
00:48:24,260 --> 00:48:26,620
And the rest
of humanity.

838
00:48:29,020 --> 00:48:30,860
Actually, we're
rather like yourself

839
00:48:30,940 --> 00:48:32,380
And dr. Cochrane.

840
00:48:34,500 --> 00:48:35,420
Aah!

841
00:48:35,460 --> 00:48:36,620
All right!
All right.

842
00:48:38,700 --> 00:48:40,260
Come on.

843
00:48:40,300 --> 00:48:42,940
Is-isn't there
another way around?

844
00:48:44,420 --> 00:48:46,780
I know what
I'm doing.

845
00:48:54,860 --> 00:48:56,820
Definitely not swedish.

846
00:49:00,940 --> 00:49:01,900
Aah!

847
00:49:08,300 --> 00:49:09,740
Aah!

848
00:49:16,140 --> 00:49:17,900
[gasps]

849
00:49:27,940 --> 00:49:29,980
What the hell
are you doing?

850
00:49:35,300 --> 00:49:37,540
[knock on door]

851
00:49:40,780 --> 00:49:43,820
Perhaps something
in satin.

852
00:49:52,060 --> 00:49:54,380
I'm sorry, gentlemen,
but we're closing.

853
00:49:54,460 --> 00:49:55,700
And you do understand

854
00:49:55,780 --> 00:49:57,620
We have a strict
dress code.

855
00:49:57,700 --> 00:50:00,060
So if you boys don't
leave right now, I'll--

856
00:50:04,580 --> 00:50:06,500
I'm looking for
nicky the nose.

857
00:50:06,580 --> 00:50:07,620
The nose?

858
00:50:07,660 --> 00:50:09,300
Hasn't been here
in months.

859
00:50:12,300 --> 00:50:14,180
This is the wrong chapter.

860
00:50:14,220 --> 00:50:15,780
Aah!

861
00:50:15,860 --> 00:50:19,420
Computer,
begin chapter 13.

862
00:50:19,460 --> 00:50:21,500
[beeps and whirs]

863
00:50:21,540 --> 00:50:23,980
¶ if I say I love you ¶

864
00:50:24,060 --> 00:50:26,660
Try to look as if
you're having a good time.

865
00:50:26,700 --> 00:50:32,020
¶ I want you to know ¶

866
00:50:32,100 --> 00:50:37,500
¶ it's not just because
there's moonlight ¶

867
00:50:37,540 --> 00:50:40,100
¶ although... ¶

868
00:50:40,140 --> 00:50:42,340
No, no, no,
look at me.

869
00:50:42,380 --> 00:50:43,780
Try to act naturally.

870
00:50:47,740 --> 00:50:49,100
There he is.

871
00:50:49,180 --> 00:50:51,420
¶ you're all dressed up ¶

872
00:50:51,460 --> 00:50:53,540
¶ to go dreamin' ¶

873
00:50:53,620 --> 00:50:58,860
¶ don't tell me,
I know... ¶

874
00:50:58,940 --> 00:50:59,820
Ruby.

875
00:50:59,900 --> 00:51:02,220
This is not a good time.

876
00:51:02,300 --> 00:51:04,260
It's never the time
for us, is it, dix?

877
00:51:04,300 --> 00:51:05,220
Always some excuse,

878
00:51:05,300 --> 00:51:06,860
Some case
you're working on.

879
00:51:06,940 --> 00:51:08,100
I have to talk to nicky.

880
00:51:08,180 --> 00:51:09,220
I'll see you later.

881
00:51:09,260 --> 00:51:10,180
Ok.

882
00:51:10,220 --> 00:51:11,460
But watch
your caboose...

883
00:51:11,540 --> 00:51:12,900
And dump the broad.

884
00:51:12,940 --> 00:51:15,980
¶ if I say ¶

885
00:51:16,060 --> 00:51:18,660
¶ I love you ¶

886
00:51:18,740 --> 00:51:21,540
¶ I want you to know... ¶

887
00:51:21,580 --> 00:51:22,500
Well, well, well,

888
00:51:22,580 --> 00:51:24,180
Look what
the cat dragged in.

889
00:51:24,260 --> 00:51:25,260
What's shakin', dix?

890
00:51:25,340 --> 00:51:26,540
The usual, nick,

891
00:51:26,620 --> 00:51:28,660
Martinis and skirts.
Excuse me.

892
00:51:30,580 --> 00:51:31,780
Whaa!

893
00:51:31,860 --> 00:51:33,700
Hey, I'm gonna take that
personal in a second.

894
00:51:33,780 --> 00:51:35,820
No offense.

895
00:51:35,900 --> 00:51:37,540
Hey!

896
00:51:37,580 --> 00:51:38,860
Ooh!

897
00:51:39,820 --> 00:51:41,140
Woman: aah!

898
00:51:58,420 --> 00:52:00,140
Yah!

899
00:52:01,860 --> 00:52:02,780
Aah!

900
00:52:02,820 --> 00:52:03,740
Hey!

901
00:52:03,780 --> 00:52:05,700
I think
you got him.

902
00:52:08,860 --> 00:52:10,220
I don't get it.

903
00:52:10,300 --> 00:52:11,500
I thought you said

904
00:52:11,580 --> 00:52:12,860
This was all just
a bunch of holograms.

905
00:52:12,900 --> 00:52:14,060
If it's holograms--

906
00:52:14,140 --> 00:52:16,100
I disengaged
the safety protocols.

907
00:52:16,140 --> 00:52:17,500
Without them,

908
00:52:17,540 --> 00:52:20,060
Even a holographic
bullet can kill.

909
00:52:20,100 --> 00:52:21,500
What are you doing?

910
00:52:21,540 --> 00:52:23,900
I'm looking for
the neuro-processor.

911
00:52:23,940 --> 00:52:25,340
Every borg has one.

912
00:52:25,380 --> 00:52:27,260
It's like a memory chip.

913
00:52:27,300 --> 00:52:30,140
It will contain a record
of all the instructions

914
00:52:30,180 --> 00:52:31,580
This borg
has been receiving

915
00:52:31,620 --> 00:52:33,020
From the collective.

916
00:52:33,060 --> 00:52:34,060
Oh, my.

917
00:52:34,140 --> 00:52:38,500
Jean-luc, it's one
of your uniforms.

918
00:52:38,580 --> 00:52:39,460
Yes.

919
00:52:39,540 --> 00:52:42,020
This was ensign lynch.

920
00:52:42,100 --> 00:52:43,100
[beeps]

921
00:52:43,140 --> 00:52:45,420
Tough luck, huh?

922
00:52:45,500 --> 00:52:48,700
We've got to get
to the bridge.

923
00:53:00,100 --> 00:53:02,100
Cochrane: go on.

924
00:53:02,180 --> 00:53:03,140
Jeez.

925
00:53:06,860 --> 00:53:07,820
Ffft.

926
00:53:16,980 --> 00:53:18,300
Geordi: doctor?

927
00:53:19,260 --> 00:53:20,260
Yeah?

928
00:53:20,340 --> 00:53:22,740
Would you mind taking
a look at this?

929
00:53:22,820 --> 00:53:24,620
Uh, ahem, yeah.

930
00:53:24,700 --> 00:53:25,780
Ahem.

931
00:53:25,860 --> 00:53:28,140
I tried to reconstruct
the intermix chamber

932
00:53:28,220 --> 00:53:30,460
From what I remember
in school.

933
00:53:30,500 --> 00:53:32,900
Tell me if
I got it right.

934
00:53:32,940 --> 00:53:33,940
School?

935
00:53:34,020 --> 00:53:35,500
You learned about
this in school?

936
00:53:35,580 --> 00:53:36,740
Oh, yeah.

937
00:53:36,820 --> 00:53:38,220
Basic warp design

938
00:53:38,300 --> 00:53:40,020
Is a required course
at the academy.

939
00:53:40,100 --> 00:53:41,860
The first chapter
is called...

940
00:53:41,940 --> 00:53:43,500
Zefram cochrane.

941
00:53:45,700 --> 00:53:48,740
Well, looks like
you got it right.

942
00:53:48,820 --> 00:53:50,660
Commander,
uh, this is what

943
00:53:50,700 --> 00:53:52,100
We're thinking of using

944
00:53:52,180 --> 00:53:55,820
To replace the damaged
warp plasma conduit.

945
00:53:59,540 --> 00:54:01,900
[whirs]

946
00:54:01,980 --> 00:54:03,740
Yeah, reg.

947
00:54:03,780 --> 00:54:05,220
Yeah, that's good.
But you need to

948
00:54:05,260 --> 00:54:06,980
Reinforce
this copper tubing

949
00:54:07,020 --> 00:54:08,300
With a nano-polymer.

950
00:54:08,380 --> 00:54:09,860
Dr. Cochrane, I know
this sounds silly,

951
00:54:09,900 --> 00:54:11,460
But can I shake
your hand?

952
00:54:15,260 --> 00:54:17,060
Oh, thank you,
doctor.

953
00:54:17,140 --> 00:54:18,220
I can't tell you
what an honor it is

954
00:54:18,300 --> 00:54:19,460
To work with you
on this project.

955
00:54:19,540 --> 00:54:21,860
I never imagined
that I'd be meeting         reg.

956
00:54:21,900 --> 00:54:23,820
The man who invented        reg!
Warp drive.

957
00:54:23,900 --> 00:54:25,580
I'm sorry. Right.

958
00:54:25,660 --> 00:54:27,020
Thanks.

959
00:54:33,020 --> 00:54:35,820
Do they have to
keep doing that?

960
00:54:35,900 --> 00:54:39,620
It's just a little
hero worship, doc.

961
00:54:39,660 --> 00:54:41,060
Tell you the truth,

962
00:54:41,100 --> 00:54:42,980
I can't say I blame them.

963
00:54:43,020 --> 00:54:45,220
We all grew up hearing
about what you did here,

964
00:54:45,300 --> 00:54:47,860
Or what
you're about to do.

965
00:54:47,940 --> 00:54:50,020
You know, I probably
shouldn't even tell you this,

966
00:54:50,060 --> 00:54:53,420
But I went to
zefram cochrane high school.

967
00:54:54,380 --> 00:54:55,340
Really.

968
00:54:58,740 --> 00:55:02,500
You know, I wish
I had a picture of this.

969
00:55:02,580 --> 00:55:03,540
What?

970
00:55:03,620 --> 00:55:04,780
Well, you see,

971
00:55:04,860 --> 00:55:06,220
In the future,

972
00:55:06,300 --> 00:55:09,700
This whole area becomes
an historical monument.

973
00:55:09,780 --> 00:55:12,580
You're standing
almost on the exact spot

974
00:55:12,660 --> 00:55:14,540
Where your statue's
gonna be.

975
00:55:14,620 --> 00:55:15,500
Statue?

976
00:55:15,580 --> 00:55:16,900
Oh, yeah.

977
00:55:16,980 --> 00:55:19,740
It's marble,
about 20 meters tall,

978
00:55:19,780 --> 00:55:22,500
And you're looking up
at the sky,

979
00:55:22,540 --> 00:55:24,500
And your hand's
sort of

980
00:55:24,580 --> 00:55:26,700
Reaching
toward the future.

981
00:55:26,780 --> 00:55:28,700
I gotta take a leak.

982
00:55:30,220 --> 00:55:31,660
Leak?

983
00:55:31,740 --> 00:55:34,980
I'm not detecting
any leak.

984
00:55:35,020 --> 00:55:37,380
Don't you people from
the 24th century ever pee?

985
00:55:37,420 --> 00:55:41,060
Oh, leak.

986
00:55:41,140 --> 00:55:42,020
I get it.

987
00:55:42,100 --> 00:55:44,340
That's pretty funny.

988
00:55:46,140 --> 00:55:47,300
Excuse me.

989
00:55:48,740 --> 00:55:50,220
Female officer:
commander?

990
00:55:53,140 --> 00:55:54,340
[lock clicks]

991
00:55:54,420 --> 00:55:56,140
[phasers whir]

992
00:55:56,220 --> 00:55:58,140
Captain.
Crusher: jean-luc.

993
00:55:58,180 --> 00:56:02,140
Reports of my assimilation
are greatly exaggerated.

994
00:56:02,180 --> 00:56:04,100
I found something you lost.

995
00:56:06,820 --> 00:56:07,940
[gasps]

996
00:56:08,020 --> 00:56:09,540
I am a klingon.

997
00:56:09,580 --> 00:56:11,620
Picard: mr. Worf,
report.

998
00:56:12,780 --> 00:56:14,500
The borg control
over half the ship.

999
00:56:14,580 --> 00:56:16,420
We have tried to restore
power to the bridge

1000
00:56:16,500 --> 00:56:17,660
And the weapons systems,

1001
00:56:17,700 --> 00:56:19,140
But we have been
unsuccessful.

1002
00:56:19,180 --> 00:56:20,540
We have another problem.

1003
00:56:20,580 --> 00:56:22,180
I've accessed a borg
neuro-processor,

1004
00:56:22,260 --> 00:56:24,100
And I've discovered what
they're trying to do.

1005
00:56:24,180 --> 00:56:26,020
They're transforming
the deflector dish

1006
00:56:26,100 --> 00:56:27,460
Into an
interplexing beacon.

1007
00:56:27,500 --> 00:56:29,060
Interplexing?

1008
00:56:29,140 --> 00:56:30,340
It's a sub-space
transmitter.

1009
00:56:30,420 --> 00:56:31,580
If they activate
the beacon,

1010
00:56:31,620 --> 00:56:33,220
They'll be able
to establish a link

1011
00:56:33,300 --> 00:56:34,980
With the borg living
in this century.

1012
00:56:35,060 --> 00:56:36,420
But in the 21st century,

1013
00:56:36,460 --> 00:56:38,340
The borg are still
in the delta quadrant.

1014
00:56:38,380 --> 00:56:39,740
They'll send
reinforcements.

1015
00:56:39,780 --> 00:56:41,700
Humanity will be
an easy target.

1016
00:56:41,780 --> 00:56:43,260
Attack the earth
in the past

1017
00:56:43,300 --> 00:56:44,740
To assimilate
the future.

1018
00:56:44,780 --> 00:56:46,500
Then we must destroy
the deflector dish

1019
00:56:46,580 --> 00:56:47,940
Before they can
activate the beacon.

1020
00:56:48,020 --> 00:56:50,340
We can't get
to deflector control

1021
00:56:50,420 --> 00:56:51,940
Or a shuttlecraft.

1022
00:56:53,860 --> 00:56:55,740
Mr. Worf,
do you remember

1023
00:56:55,780 --> 00:56:57,660
Your zero-g
combat training?

1024
00:56:57,700 --> 00:57:01,060
I remember it made me
sick to my stomach.

1025
00:57:03,620 --> 00:57:05,020
What are you suggesting?

1026
00:57:05,060 --> 00:57:09,340
I think it's time that
we took a little stroll.

1027
00:57:13,540 --> 00:57:15,220
Hang on.

1028
00:57:15,300 --> 00:57:17,220
There's a humanoid
life sign up ahead,

1029
00:57:17,300 --> 00:57:19,260
511 meters.

1030
00:57:20,980 --> 00:57:22,820
[whirring]

1031
00:57:27,020 --> 00:57:28,460
Cochrane?

1032
00:57:30,140 --> 00:57:31,460
Mm-hmm.

1033
00:57:31,540 --> 00:57:32,820
It's him all right.

1034
00:57:36,140 --> 00:57:37,420
[beep beep beep beep]

1035
00:57:38,700 --> 00:57:39,660
[hums]

1036
00:57:43,620 --> 00:57:45,900
I have remodulated
the pulse emitters,

1037
00:57:45,980 --> 00:57:49,020
But I do not believe we will
get more than one or 2 shots

1038
00:57:49,060 --> 00:57:50,300
Before the borg adapt.

1039
00:57:50,340 --> 00:57:53,260
Then we must make
every shot count.

1040
00:57:56,380 --> 00:57:57,380
Magnetize.

1041
00:57:57,460 --> 00:57:58,980
[beep]

1042
00:57:59,020 --> 00:57:59,940
[hums]
[hums]

1043
00:58:00,020 --> 00:58:02,460
[boots making
suction sounds]

1044
00:58:02,500 --> 00:58:04,060
Watch your caboose, dix.

1045
00:58:04,100 --> 00:58:05,740
I intend to.

1046
00:58:26,580 --> 00:58:28,460
How are you doing,
mr. Worf?

1047
00:58:28,500 --> 00:58:29,860
Not well, sir.

1048
00:58:29,940 --> 00:58:32,340
Try not to look
at the stars.

1049
00:58:32,420 --> 00:58:34,260
Keep your eyes
on the hull.

1050
00:58:39,380 --> 00:58:40,820
Picard: let's go.

1051
00:59:04,580 --> 00:59:05,700
Tell me,

1052
00:59:05,740 --> 00:59:08,260
Are you using
a polymer-based neuro-relay

1053
00:59:08,300 --> 00:59:10,260
To transit the organic
nerve impulses

1054
00:59:10,340 --> 00:59:13,740
To the central processor
of my positronic net?

1055
00:59:13,780 --> 00:59:16,300
If that is the case,
how have you solved

1056
00:59:16,340 --> 00:59:18,540
The problem of increased
signal degradation

1057
00:59:18,620 --> 00:59:20,460
Inherent to organo-synthetic
transmission acro--

1058
00:59:20,500 --> 00:59:23,540
Borg queen: do you
always talk this much?

1059
00:59:23,620 --> 00:59:25,940
Not always...

1060
00:59:26,020 --> 00:59:26,900
But often.

1061
00:59:26,980 --> 00:59:28,780
Why do you insist
on utilizing

1062
00:59:28,820 --> 00:59:30,660
This primitive
linguistic communication?

1063
00:59:30,700 --> 00:59:34,180
Your android brain is
capable of so much more.

1064
00:59:34,220 --> 00:59:35,220
Have you forgotten?

1065
00:59:35,300 --> 00:59:37,300
I am endeavoring
to become more human.

1066
00:59:37,380 --> 00:59:38,340
Human.

1067
00:59:38,380 --> 00:59:40,340
We used to be
exactly like them:

1068
00:59:40,420 --> 00:59:42,380
Flawed, weak,

1069
00:59:42,420 --> 00:59:43,540
Organic...

1070
00:59:44,980 --> 00:59:47,620
But we evolved to
include the synthetic.

1071
00:59:47,700 --> 00:59:50,900
Now we use both
to attain perfection.

1072
00:59:50,980 --> 00:59:53,820
Your goal should be
the same as ours.

1073
00:59:56,100 --> 00:59:58,500
Believing oneself
to be perfect

1074
00:59:58,580 --> 01:00:01,740
Is often the sign
of a delusional mind.

1075
01:00:01,780 --> 01:00:04,100
Small words from a small being

1076
01:00:04,140 --> 01:00:06,340
Trying to attack what
he doesn't understand.

1077
01:00:06,420 --> 01:00:09,540
I understand that you have
no real interest in me,

1078
01:00:09,620 --> 01:00:10,980
That your goal
is to obtain

1079
01:00:11,060 --> 01:00:12,260
The encryption codes

1080
01:00:12,300 --> 01:00:13,620
<i>For the enterprise
computer.</i>

1081
01:00:13,700 --> 01:00:15,940
That is one of our goals,

1082
01:00:15,980 --> 01:00:16,940
One of many...

1083
01:00:18,660 --> 01:00:20,500
But in order to reach it,

1084
01:00:20,580 --> 01:00:22,740
I'm willing
to help you reach yours.

1085
01:00:36,460 --> 01:00:37,700
Aah!

1086
01:00:41,220 --> 01:00:42,580
[exhales]

1087
01:00:46,900 --> 01:00:49,540
Is it becoming clear
to you yet?

1088
01:00:49,620 --> 01:00:51,620
Look at yourself...
Standing there

1089
01:00:51,660 --> 01:00:55,060
Cradling the new flesh
that I've given you.

1090
01:00:56,420 --> 01:00:59,940
If it means nothing to you,
why protect it?

1091
01:00:59,980 --> 01:01:01,620
I...

1092
01:01:01,700 --> 01:01:04,580
I am simply imitating
the behavior of humans.

1093
01:01:04,660 --> 01:01:05,860
You're becoming
more human

1094
01:01:05,940 --> 01:01:07,060
All the time, data.

1095
01:01:07,140 --> 01:01:08,980
Now you're learning
how to lie.

1096
01:01:11,060 --> 01:01:12,420
My...

1097
01:01:12,500 --> 01:01:14,100
Programming
was not designed

1098
01:01:14,180 --> 01:01:16,580
To process
these sensations.

1099
01:01:16,660 --> 01:01:18,740
Then tear the skin
from your limb

1100
01:01:18,820 --> 01:01:20,740
As you would
a defective circuit.

1101
01:01:23,700 --> 01:01:25,060
Go ahead, data.

1102
01:01:25,140 --> 01:01:26,980
We won't stop you.

1103
01:01:31,380 --> 01:01:33,420
Do it.

1104
01:01:33,460 --> 01:01:35,380
Don't be tempted
by flesh.

1105
01:01:45,540 --> 01:01:48,660
Are you familiar with
physical forms of pleasure?

1106
01:01:48,740 --> 01:01:50,060
Eh...

1107
01:01:50,100 --> 01:01:52,100
If you are...

1108
01:01:52,140 --> 01:01:54,420
Referring to...

1109
01:01:54,500 --> 01:01:57,300
Sexuality...

1110
01:01:57,380 --> 01:01:59,140
I am...

1111
01:01:59,220 --> 01:02:00,260
Fully functional...

1112
01:02:01,620 --> 01:02:04,260
Programmed in...

1113
01:02:04,340 --> 01:02:05,740
Multiple techniques.

1114
01:02:05,780 --> 01:02:09,060
How long has it been
since you've used them?

1115
01:02:09,100 --> 01:02:11,300
8 years...

1116
01:02:11,380 --> 01:02:14,100
7 months, 16 days,
4 minutes, 22--

1117
01:02:14,180 --> 01:02:15,700
Far too long.

1118
01:02:45,100 --> 01:02:46,980
We should bring
reinforcements.

1119
01:02:47,060 --> 01:02:48,140
There's no time.

1120
01:02:48,180 --> 01:02:50,340
It looks as if they're
building the beacon

1121
01:02:50,420 --> 01:02:52,580
Right on top
of the particle emitter.

1122
01:02:52,660 --> 01:02:54,820
Once all
the transponder rods
are in place,

1123
01:02:54,900 --> 01:02:56,180
The beacon
will be activated.

1124
01:02:56,260 --> 01:02:58,660
Well, if we set
our phasers to
full power, we--

1125
01:02:58,740 --> 01:03:00,980
No. There's a risk
that we'd hit the dish.

1126
01:03:01,060 --> 01:03:02,420
It's charged
with anti-protons.

1127
01:03:02,500 --> 01:03:04,260
We could destroy
half the ship.

1128
01:03:04,300 --> 01:03:05,940
We have to find
another way.

1129
01:03:06,020 --> 01:03:07,940
[panting]

1130
01:03:19,140 --> 01:03:20,500
Come on, come on.

1131
01:03:24,900 --> 01:03:25,780
Doctor?

1132
01:03:25,860 --> 01:03:26,820
Sir?

1133
01:03:31,060 --> 01:03:33,140
You still looking
for the bathroom?

1134
01:03:33,220 --> 01:03:34,420
I'm not going back.

1135
01:03:34,500 --> 01:03:37,060
Look, doc, we can't
do this without you.

1136
01:03:37,140 --> 01:03:38,020
I don't care.

1137
01:03:38,100 --> 01:03:39,540
I don't want
to be a statue.

1138
01:03:39,620 --> 01:03:40,740
Doctor--

1139
01:03:40,780 --> 01:03:42,340
You stay away from me.

1140
01:03:42,380 --> 01:03:44,180
We don't have time
for this.

1141
01:03:44,260 --> 01:03:46,180
Unh.

1142
01:03:50,660 --> 01:03:52,580
[gasping]

1143
01:04:00,260 --> 01:04:02,180
You told him
about the statue?

1144
01:04:04,580 --> 01:04:06,100
Picard:
for this to work,

1145
01:04:06,180 --> 01:04:09,380
All 3 maglocks will
have to be released.

1146
01:06:14,020 --> 01:06:16,580
O;-#
magnetic constrictors
are disengaged.

1147
01:06:19,300 --> 01:06:20,380
They've adapted.

1148
01:07:15,900 --> 01:07:17,300
Computer: warning.

1149
01:07:17,380 --> 01:07:19,300
Decompression
in 45 seconds.

1150
01:07:19,420 --> 01:07:21,380
[air escaping]

1151
01:07:44,340 --> 01:07:45,340
Hawk!

1152
01:07:45,380 --> 01:07:46,340
Ah.

1153
01:07:46,420 --> 01:07:48,980
Aah!

1154
01:08:26,980 --> 01:08:27,940
[beep beep]

1155
01:08:48,580 --> 01:08:49,500
[beep]

1156
01:08:49,540 --> 01:08:50,500
[hums]

1157
01:08:51,860 --> 01:08:53,100
[hums]

1158
01:08:54,780 --> 01:08:56,340
[hums]

1159
01:09:05,340 --> 01:09:07,420
Nnn. Unnhh!

1160
01:10:15,580 --> 01:10:17,820
We've had a change
of plans, data.

1161
01:10:27,780 --> 01:10:29,580
Assimilate this.

1162
01:10:57,300 --> 01:11:00,100
Only got an hour to go, doc.
How you feeling?

1163
01:11:00,180 --> 01:11:02,260
I got
a 4-alarm hangover,

1164
01:11:02,340 --> 01:11:05,540
Either from the whiskey
or your laser beam...

1165
01:11:05,660 --> 01:11:07,100
Or both,

1166
01:11:07,140 --> 01:11:10,300
But I'm ready
to make history.
Ha ha ha ha.

1167
01:11:10,340 --> 01:11:11,940
Troi to commander riker.

1168
01:11:12,020 --> 01:11:13,020
Riker here.

1169
01:11:13,060 --> 01:11:15,140
We're ready to open
the launch door.

1170
01:11:15,220 --> 01:11:16,180
Riker: go ahead.

1171
01:11:19,620 --> 01:11:21,540
[door opening]

1172
01:11:26,180 --> 01:11:27,140
Oh.

1173
01:11:28,100 --> 01:11:29,980
Look at that.

1174
01:11:32,340 --> 01:11:34,660
What, you
don't have a moon
in the 24th century?

1175
01:11:34,740 --> 01:11:36,900
Sure we do. Just
looks a lot different.

1176
01:11:36,980 --> 01:11:39,780
There are
50 million people living
on the moon in my time.

1177
01:11:39,900 --> 01:11:42,420
You see tycho city,
new berlin,

1178
01:11:42,500 --> 01:11:44,980
Even to lake armstrong
on a day like this.

1179
01:11:45,060 --> 01:11:45,940
Uh-huh.

1180
01:11:46,020 --> 01:11:47,220
And you know, doctor--

1181
01:11:47,300 --> 01:11:50,180
Please! Don't tell me
it's all thanks to me.

1182
01:11:50,260 --> 01:11:52,740
I've heard enough
about the great
zefram cochrane.

1183
01:11:52,820 --> 01:11:54,940
I don't know who writes
your history books

1184
01:11:54,980 --> 01:11:56,740
Or where you get your
information from,

1185
01:11:56,860 --> 01:12:00,420
But you people got
some pretty funny
ideas about me.

1186
01:12:00,420 --> 01:12:03,940
You all look at me as if
I'm some kind of...

1187
01:12:03,940 --> 01:12:05,620
Saint or visionary
or something.

1188
01:12:05,700 --> 01:12:08,020
I don't think
you're a saint, doc,

1189
01:12:08,100 --> 01:12:10,020
But you did
have a vision,

1190
01:12:10,140 --> 01:12:11,940
And now we're
sitting in it.

1191
01:12:13,500 --> 01:12:16,100
You want to know
what my vision is?

1192
01:12:16,220 --> 01:12:17,540
Dollar signs.

1193
01:12:17,620 --> 01:12:18,500
Money.

1194
01:12:18,580 --> 01:12:20,100
I didn't build this ship

1195
01:12:20,180 --> 01:12:22,660
To usher in a new era
for humanity.

1196
01:12:22,780 --> 01:12:25,540
You think I want
to go to the stars?

1197
01:12:25,660 --> 01:12:27,460
I don't even
like to fly.

1198
01:12:27,580 --> 01:12:29,620
I take trains.

1199
01:12:29,700 --> 01:12:30,940
I built this ship

1200
01:12:30,980 --> 01:12:34,820
So that I could
retire to some
tropical island...

1201
01:12:34,900 --> 01:12:37,060
Filled with...

1202
01:12:37,140 --> 01:12:38,300
Naked women.

1203
01:12:38,340 --> 01:12:40,380
That's zefram cochrane.

1204
01:12:40,420 --> 01:12:42,660
That's his vision.

1205
01:12:42,660 --> 01:12:44,900
This other guy
you keep talking about,

1206
01:12:44,900 --> 01:12:46,340
This historical
figure...

1207
01:12:47,940 --> 01:12:50,020
I never met him.

1208
01:12:50,020 --> 01:12:51,940
I can't imagine
I ever will.

1209
01:12:53,220 --> 01:12:54,580
Someone once said,

1210
01:12:54,660 --> 01:12:56,820
"don't try to be
a great man.

1211
01:12:56,900 --> 01:13:00,420
Just be a man,
and let history make
its own judgments."

1212
01:13:00,420 --> 01:13:02,580
That's rhetorical
nonsense.

1213
01:13:04,180 --> 01:13:05,340
Who said that?

1214
01:13:05,380 --> 01:13:07,940
You did...
10 years from now.

1215
01:13:08,900 --> 01:13:10,740
You got 58 minutes, doc.

1216
01:13:10,820 --> 01:13:12,700
You better
get on that checklist.

1217
01:13:12,740 --> 01:13:14,300
They're on the move again.

1218
01:13:14,340 --> 01:13:16,740
The borg
just overran 3 of our
defense checkpoints.

1219
01:13:16,820 --> 01:13:18,900
They've taken over
decks 5 and 6.

1220
01:13:18,980 --> 01:13:21,020
They've adapted
to every modulation
of our weapons.

1221
01:13:21,060 --> 01:13:22,660
It's like we're
shooting blanks.

1222
01:13:22,740 --> 01:13:25,940
We have to work
on finding another way
to modify our weapons

1223
01:13:26,020 --> 01:13:27,540
So they'll
be more effective.

1224
01:13:27,620 --> 01:13:28,580
In the meantime,

1225
01:13:28,660 --> 01:13:30,420
Tell your men
to stand their ground.

1226
01:13:30,500 --> 01:13:31,460
Sir.

1227
01:13:31,460 --> 01:13:34,780
Fight hand-to-hand
if they have to.

1228
01:13:34,820 --> 01:13:35,780
Aye, sir.

1229
01:13:38,660 --> 01:13:39,780
Wait.

1230
01:13:39,780 --> 01:13:41,380
Captain, our weapons
are useless.

1231
01:13:41,380 --> 01:13:43,460
We must activate
the auto-destruct
sequence

1232
01:13:43,580 --> 01:13:46,020
And use the escape pods
to evacuate the ship.

1233
01:13:46,100 --> 01:13:47,580
No!

1234
01:13:47,620 --> 01:13:50,620
Crusher: jean-luc,
if we destroy the ship,
we destroy the borg.

1235
01:13:50,660 --> 01:13:52,580
We're going to
stay and fight.

1236
01:13:52,580 --> 01:13:55,940
<i>Sir, we have lost
the enterprise.
We should not sacrifice--</i>

1237
01:13:56,060 --> 01:13:57,540
<i>We have not lost
the enterprise,
mr. Worf.</i>

1238
01:13:57,660 --> 01:13:58,980
We're not going
to lose it,

1239
01:13:59,100 --> 01:14:01,140
Not to the borg,
not while I'm
in command.

1240
01:14:01,220 --> 01:14:02,340
You have
your orders.

1241
01:14:02,340 --> 01:14:04,660
I must object
to this course
of action--

1242
01:14:04,740 --> 01:14:05,940
Your objection
is noted.

1243
01:14:06,020 --> 01:14:07,540
With all
due respect, sir,

1244
01:14:07,620 --> 01:14:09,140
I believe
you are allowing

1245
01:14:09,220 --> 01:14:12,380
Your personal experience
with the borg to influence
your judgment.

1246
01:14:14,340 --> 01:14:15,620
You're afraid.

1247
01:14:15,700 --> 01:14:18,740
You want
to destroy the ship
and run away.

1248
01:14:18,820 --> 01:14:20,340
You coward.

1249
01:14:20,420 --> 01:14:21,380
Crusher: jean-luc.

1250
01:14:22,460 --> 01:14:24,420
If you were
any other man,

1251
01:14:24,420 --> 01:14:26,740
I would kill you
where you stand.

1252
01:14:26,820 --> 01:14:28,860
Get off my bridge.

1253
01:14:36,740 --> 01:14:39,420
[door opens and closes]

1254
01:14:41,860 --> 01:14:43,700
So, what do we do now?

1255
01:14:43,780 --> 01:14:45,300
We carry out his orders.

1256
01:14:45,380 --> 01:14:47,860
Dyson, kaplan,
start working on a way
to modify the weapons--

1257
01:14:47,940 --> 01:14:50,020
This is stupid.
If we can get
off this ship

1258
01:14:50,100 --> 01:14:51,620
And then
blow it up,
let's do it.

1259
01:14:51,740 --> 01:14:54,900
Once the captain's
made up his mind,
the discussion is over.

1260
01:14:54,980 --> 01:14:55,860
Lily!

1261
01:14:55,940 --> 01:14:56,900
[door opens]

1262
01:14:58,180 --> 01:14:59,700
You son of a bitch.

1263
01:14:59,780 --> 01:15:01,300
This really
isn't the time.

1264
01:15:01,380 --> 01:15:04,180
Ok. I don't know jack
about the 24th century,

1265
01:15:04,260 --> 01:15:05,660
But everybody out there

1266
01:15:05,700 --> 01:15:08,060
Thinks that staying here
and fighting the borg
is suicide.

1267
01:15:08,100 --> 01:15:10,740
They're just afraid
to come in here
and say it.

1268
01:15:10,820 --> 01:15:12,820
The crew is accustomed

1272
01:15:21,140 --> 01:15:22,740
No one can.

1275
01:15:31,580 --> 01:15:33,820

into their collective.

1276

cybernetic devices

1277

throughout my body.

1278
01:15:39,700 --> 01:15:42,180

to the hive mind,

1279

of individuality erased.

1280
01:15:46,020 --> 01:15:47,700

1281
01:15:47,780 --> 01:15:49,620
So you can imagine,
my dear,

1282
01:15:49,700 --> 01:15:52,500
I have a somewhat
unique perspective
on the borg,

1283
01:15:52,580 --> 01:15:54,620
And I know
how to fight them.

1284
01:15:54,660 --> 01:15:57,540
Now, if
you will excuse me,
I have work to do.

1285

It's so simple.

1287

The borg hurt you,

1288
01:16:06,820 --> 01:16:09,300
And now you're going
to hurt them back.

1289
01:16:09,380 --> 01:16:11,860

succumb to revenge.

sensibility.

1291
01:16:13,860 --> 01:16:16,020

the look on your face

When you shot those borg
on the holodeck.

1293

enjoying it.

1295

Yore not the first man

1296

1446
01:26:18,900 --> 01:26:21,540
How could you
forget me so quickly?

1447
01:26:21,620 --> 01:26:23,900
We were very close,
you and I.

1448
01:26:25,220 --> 01:26:27,620
You can still
hear our song.

1449
01:26:29,180 --> 01:26:30,140
Yes, I...

1450
01:26:32,100 --> 01:26:33,540
I remember you.

1451
01:26:33,660 --> 01:26:36,220
You were there
all the time.

1452
01:26:37,540 --> 01:26:38,500
But...

1453
01:26:38,620 --> 01:26:39,620
That ship...

1454
01:26:40,980 --> 01:26:43,460
And all the borg on it
were destroyed.

1455
01:26:43,540 --> 01:26:47,140
You think in such
3-dimensional terms.

1456
01:26:47,220 --> 01:26:48,980
How small you've become.

1457
01:26:49,060 --> 01:26:51,140
Data understands me.

1458
01:26:53,060 --> 01:26:54,340
Don't you, data?

1459
01:26:57,860 --> 01:27:00,100
What have you done to him?

1460
01:27:00,100 --> 01:27:03,140
Given him what
he always wanted,
flesh and blood.

1461
01:27:04,900 --> 01:27:07,380
Let him go.

1462
01:27:07,460 --> 01:27:09,300
He's not
the one you want.

1463
01:27:09,380 --> 01:27:12,220
Are you offering
yourself to us?

1464
01:27:13,700 --> 01:27:15,060
Offering myself?

1465
01:27:17,540 --> 01:27:19,620
That's it.

1466
01:27:19,740 --> 01:27:21,180
I remember now.

1467
01:27:21,220 --> 01:27:23,620
It wasn't enough
that you assimilate me.

1468
01:27:25,220 --> 01:27:28,100
I had to give myself
freely to the borg...

1469
01:27:30,020 --> 01:27:30,940
To you.

1470
01:27:30,980 --> 01:27:32,260
You flatter yourself.

1471
01:27:32,380 --> 01:27:34,180
I've overseen
the assimilation
of countless millions.

1472
01:27:34,300 --> 01:27:35,460
You were no different.

1473
01:27:35,580 --> 01:27:36,900
You're lying.

1474
01:27:36,980 --> 01:27:39,460
You wanted more
than just another
borg drone.

1475
01:27:39,540 --> 01:27:42,700
You wanted a human being
with a mind of his own

1476
01:27:42,780 --> 01:27:45,580
Who could bridge
the gulf between
humanity and the borg.

1477
01:27:45,660 --> 01:27:46,860
You wanted
a counterpart,

1478
01:27:46,940 --> 01:27:48,020
But I resisted.

1479
01:27:48,060 --> 01:27:50,140
I fought you.

1480
01:27:50,180 --> 01:27:53,860
You can't begin
to imagine the life
you denied yourself.

1481
01:27:57,820 --> 01:27:59,740
It's not too late.

1482
01:28:02,780 --> 01:28:05,140
Locutus could
still be with you...

1483
01:28:05,220 --> 01:28:07,460
Just in the way
you wanted--

1484
01:28:07,580 --> 01:28:09,940
An equal.

1485
01:28:10,020 --> 01:28:11,380
Let data go,

1486
01:28:11,460 --> 01:28:14,660
And I will
take my place
at your side,

1487
01:28:14,660 --> 01:28:17,860
Willingly without
any resistance.

1488
01:28:17,940 --> 01:28:21,220
Such a noble creature...

1489
01:28:21,220 --> 01:28:25,220
A quality
we sometimes lack.

1490
01:28:25,300 --> 01:28:28,580
We will add
your distinctiveness
to our own.

1491
01:28:29,780 --> 01:28:32,260
Welcome home...

1492
01:28:32,340 --> 01:28:33,780
Locutus.

1493
01:28:38,980 --> 01:28:40,740
Data, you are
free to go.

1494
01:28:42,740 --> 01:28:44,580
Data, go.

1495
01:28:44,660 --> 01:28:45,860
No.

1496
01:28:48,260 --> 01:28:50,180
I do not wish to go.

1497
01:28:50,180 --> 01:28:54,180
As you can see,
I have already
found an equal.

1498
01:28:54,300 --> 01:28:58,260
Data, deactivate
the self-destruct
sequence.

1499
01:28:59,780 --> 01:29:01,820
Data, no. Don't do it.

1500
01:29:03,620 --> 01:29:04,900
Data, listen to me.

1501
01:29:06,780 --> 01:29:10,500
Computer: auto-destruct
sequence deactivated.

1502
01:29:12,340 --> 01:29:16,420
Now enter
the encryption codes and
give me computer control.

1503
01:29:17,860 --> 01:29:18,820
Data!

1504
01:29:22,260 --> 01:29:23,380
Data...

1505
01:29:33,060 --> 01:29:35,940
He will make
an excellent drone.

1506
01:29:43,460 --> 01:29:45,700
Plasma injectors
are on-line...

1507
01:29:45,700 --> 01:29:48,580
Everything's
looking good.

1508
01:29:48,580 --> 01:29:49,540
I think
we're ready.

1509
01:29:49,660 --> 01:29:51,740
They should be
out there right now.

1510
01:29:51,780 --> 01:29:54,140
We better break
the warp barrier
in the next 5 minutes

1511
01:29:54,180 --> 01:29:55,300
If we're going to
get their attention.

1512
01:29:55,300 --> 01:29:57,540
Nacelles are
charged and ready.

1513
01:29:57,660 --> 01:29:58,620
Let's do it!

1514
01:29:59,780 --> 01:30:00,740
Engage.

1515
01:30:10,340 --> 01:30:12,820
Warp field
is looking good.

1516
01:30:12,900 --> 01:30:15,620
Structural
integrity...
Is holding.

1517
01:30:15,740 --> 01:30:18,980
Speed--20,000 kilometers
per second.

1518
01:30:23,380 --> 01:30:25,380
Sweet jesus!

1519
01:30:28,420 --> 01:30:29,860
Relax, doctor.

1520
01:30:29,940 --> 01:30:32,260
I'm sure
they're just here
to give us a send-off.

1521
01:30:35,780 --> 01:30:38,940
I am bringing
the external
sensors on-line.

1522
01:30:45,780 --> 01:30:48,220
30 seconds
to warp threshold.

1523
01:30:58,660 --> 01:31:00,900
Approaching
light speed...

1524
01:31:01,020 --> 01:31:03,300
We're at critical
velocity.

1525
01:31:03,380 --> 01:31:05,060
Qutum
torpedoes
locked.

1526
01:31:05,060 --> 01:31:06,340
Destroy them.

1527
01:31:13,820 --> 01:31:14,980
Watch...

1528
01:31:14,980 --> 01:31:17,060
Your future's end.

1529
01:31:34,140 --> 01:31:35,300
Data!

1530
01:31:35,300 --> 01:31:38,500
Resistance
is futile.

1531
01:32:12,660 --> 01:32:14,660
Aaah!

1532
01:32:14,660 --> 01:32:17,540
Whoooa...

1533
01:32:29,060 --> 01:32:30,020
Aah!

1534
01:32:31,460 --> 01:32:32,900
Aah...

1535
01:32:39,460 --> 01:32:41,060
Aah!

1536
01:32:49,220 --> 01:32:53,140
Aaah!

1537
01:33:01,500 --> 01:33:02,660
That should be
enough.

1538
01:33:02,780 --> 01:33:04,660
Throttle back.
Take us out of warp.

1539
01:33:16,060 --> 01:33:18,020
Is that earth?

1540
01:33:18,100 --> 01:33:19,700
Geordi: that's it.

1541
01:33:21,140 --> 01:33:22,820
It's so small.

1542
01:33:22,940 --> 01:33:26,020
It's about to get
a whole lot bigger.

1543
01:34:44,420 --> 01:34:45,500
Captain.

1544
01:34:45,540 --> 01:34:47,220
Data.

1545
01:34:49,060 --> 01:34:50,340
Are you all right?

1546
01:34:50,340 --> 01:34:53,380
I would imagine
I look worse than I...

1547
01:34:56,260 --> 01:34:57,540
Feel.

1548
01:35:02,980 --> 01:35:05,380
Strange.

1549
01:35:05,500 --> 01:35:07,940
Part of me is...

1550
01:35:08,060 --> 01:35:10,340
Sorry she is dead.

1551
01:35:13,340 --> 01:35:14,980
She was unique.

1552
01:35:15,100 --> 01:35:17,380
She brought me
closer to humanity

1553
01:35:17,500 --> 01:35:20,260
Than I ever
thought possible,

1554
01:35:20,380 --> 01:35:22,500
And for a time...

1555
01:35:22,620 --> 01:35:25,380
I was tempted
by her offer.

1556
01:35:27,220 --> 01:35:29,220
How long a time?

1557
01:35:31,260 --> 01:35:33,540
0.68 seconds, sir.

1558
01:35:35,540 --> 01:35:37,860
For an android...

1559
01:35:37,980 --> 01:35:40,580
That is nearly
an eternity.

1560
01:35:51,460 --> 01:35:56,180
Picard: captain's log,
April 5, 2063.

1561
01:35:56,260 --> 01:35:59,300
<i>The voyage of the phoenix
was a success...</i>

1562
01:35:59,380 --> 01:36:00,420
Again.

1563
01:36:00,540 --> 01:36:03,620
The alien ship
detected the warp signature

1564
01:36:03,620 --> 01:36:06,940
And is on its way
to rendezvous with history.

1565
01:37:17,340 --> 01:37:19,260
My god...

1566
01:37:19,300 --> 01:37:21,700
They're really
from another world.

1567
01:37:21,700 --> 01:37:26,500
And they're going to
want to meet the man
who flew that warp ship.

1568
01:38:14,020 --> 01:38:16,900
Live long and prosper.

1569
01:38:37,140 --> 01:38:38,180
Thanks.

1570
01:38:42,500 --> 01:38:45,140
I think
it's time we made
a discreet exit.

1571
01:38:45,220 --> 01:38:46,660
[communicator beeps]

1572
01:38:46,740 --> 01:38:47,940
<i>Riker to enterprise,</i>

1573
01:38:48,020 --> 01:38:49,860
Stand by
to beam us up.

1574
01:38:56,580 --> 01:38:58,020
You gotta go?

1575
01:39:02,260 --> 01:39:04,420
I envy you...

1576
01:39:04,500 --> 01:39:08,100
The world
you're going to.

1577
01:39:08,180 --> 01:39:10,660
I envy you...

1578
01:39:10,740 --> 01:39:14,260
Taking these first steps
into a new frontier.

1579
01:39:16,420 --> 01:39:18,580
I shall miss you, lily.

1580
01:39:32,660 --> 01:39:34,020
<i>Picard to enterprise,</i>

1581
01:39:34,100 --> 01:39:35,300
Energize.

1582
01:39:43,300 --> 01:39:44,700
Report.

1583
01:39:44,740 --> 01:39:46,780
The moon's gravitational
field obscured
our warp signature.

1584
01:39:46,820 --> 01:39:48,060
The vulcans
did not detect us.

1585
01:39:48,100 --> 01:39:49,860
Captain,
I've reconfigured
our warp field

1586
01:39:49,980 --> 01:39:51,460
To match the
chronometric readings
of the borg sphere.

1587
01:39:51,580 --> 01:39:52,900
Recreate the vortex,
commander.

1588
01:39:52,900 --> 01:39:53,860
Aye, sir.

1589
01:39:53,860 --> 01:39:54,820
All decks
report ready.

1590
01:39:54,820 --> 01:39:56,380
Helm standing by.

1591
01:39:56,420 --> 01:39:59,420
Mr. Data, lay in a course
for the 24th century.

1592
01:39:59,460 --> 01:40:02,620
I suspect our future
is there waiting for us.

1593
01:40:02,660 --> 01:40:04,740
Course laid in, sir.

1594
01:40:06,820 --> 01:40:08,260
Make it so.

1595
01:40:23,460 --> 01:40:26,180
No, no. It's music.
I'll play you some.
