meet us tomorrow.

182
00:14:05,817 --> 00:14:09,012
At Ferry Pier.
Three o'clock.

183
00:14:09,014 --> 00:14:13,002
I'll be a little richer, and
you'll have another day to live.

184
00:14:13,004 --> 00:14:15,806
(ENGINE CHOKING)
Come on, start, you son of a bitch!

185
00:14:19,625 --> 00:14:22,316
How can you race that guy?
You can't even start your car.

186
00:14:24,622 --> 00:14:25,754
(KNOCKING ON CAR)
Who's that?

187
00:14:27,567 --> 00:14:29,864
You aren't leaving me, are you?

188
00:14:30,002 --> 00:14:32,012
Uh, hi.

189
00:14:32,338 --> 00:14:34,238
Please get in.
Thanks.

190
00:14:38,477 --> 00:14:39,967
I appreciate all your help.

191
00:14:40,479 --> 00:14:42,169
I just started working here last week.

192
00:14:42,314 --> 00:14:44,407
That gangster's been
bugging me every night.

193
00:14:44,516 --> 00:14:45,813
If you didn't show up,

194
00:14:45,951 --> 00:14:47,742
I would have been in trouble.

195
00:14:47,853 --> 00:14:49,350
What's your name?

196
00:14:49,356 --> 00:14:50,545
Boomer.

197
00:14:50,550 --> 00:14:51,989
Oh, I see.

198
00:14:51,992 --> 00:14:52,649
And you?

199
00:14:52,727 --> 00:14:54,221
Tyson.

200
00:14:54,224 --> 00:14:55,144
Ah.

201
00:14:56,004 --> 00:14:57,896
You don't know who he is?

202
00:14:57,898 --> 00:14:59,691
Not really.

203
00:14:59,734 --> 00:15:01,633
You told me
she was your girl.

204
00:15:01,937 --> 00:15:03,838
Uh, well, she is sort of.
I'm working on it.

205
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:06,564
How dare you?
That's it.

206
00:15:07,364 --> 00:15:09,458
I'm getting out of here.

207
00:15:11,315 --> 00:15:15,217
Wait.
Leave me alone.

208
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:17,448
Boomer!
Boomer!

209
00:15:17,552 --> 00:15:18,496
We've been friends forever.

210
00:15:18,498 --> 00:15:19,885
You can't let a little thing
like this come between us.

211
00:15:19,887 --> 00:15:21,776
Look, we've been
to hell and back together,

212
00:15:21,790 --> 00:15:24,086
but you have to get a grip
on reality.

213
00:15:24,258 --> 00:15:26,953
How could she be interested in you?

214
00:15:27,006 --> 00:15:29,854
You two have nothing in common.
Look at her hair.

215
00:15:29,962 --> 00:15:31,759
I don't know..

216
00:15:31,832 --> 00:15:33,924
I think I got a shot. Don't you?

217
00:15:34,136 --> 00:15:37,498
(GROANS)
You're driving me crazy!

218
00:15:37,504 --> 00:15:38,628
(SNORTS)

219
00:15:46,214 --> 00:15:48,710
I didn't like that job anyway.

220
00:15:52,155 --> 00:15:53,986
Uh, what's your name again?

221
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,178
Barbara.

222
00:15:55,391 --> 00:15:56,988
Uh, Barbara, that's right.

223
00:15:56,995 --> 00:15:59,590
Do you think you can
tell the big hero over there..

224
00:15:59,802 --> 00:16:01,791
If you might be
interested in him?

225
00:16:13,542 --> 00:16:16,942
Just between us,
you see...

226
00:16:18,146 --> 00:16:19,996
he's never had a girlfriend.

227
00:16:20,682 --> 00:16:22,279
It was nice meeting you.

228
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:28,211
You have a good time.
I'm going home now.

229
00:16:28,524 --> 00:16:29,988
I'm sorry, Boomer.

230
00:16:55,484 --> 00:16:57,975
Excuse me Mister Ma, is this
your first visit to Hong Kong?

231
00:16:58,153 --> 00:16:59,051
Yes.

232
00:16:59,112 --> 00:17:01,086
Well, we certainly look forward
to your concert, sir.

233
00:17:06,853 --> 00:17:07,976
Three hundred thousand.

234
00:17:09,962 --> 00:17:11,657
This is the last time.
Come on, I need a car.

235
00:17:12,397 --> 00:17:14,695
Look, last time
you were three hours late.

236
00:17:14,933 --> 00:17:17,140
You sure didn't complain
when I gave you $400.

237
00:17:17,902 --> 00:17:19,032
Are you backing down on our deal?

238
00:17:19,436 --> 00:17:21,932
You scratched the last one up.
They almost found me out.

239
00:17:21,937 --> 00:17:23,837
That's $600 you owe me.

240
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:24,966
Hmm.
Hey!

241
00:17:24,968 --> 00:17:27,470
Careful.
They might be watching us now.

242
00:17:27,908 --> 00:17:30,399
This is the last time.
I never wanna see you guys again.

243
00:17:31,377 --> 00:17:32,444
Step on it!

244
00:17:32,446 --> 00:17:33,884
Yeah!

245
00:17:36,446 --> 00:17:37,743
I'll be back in a second.

246
00:17:37,745 --> 00:17:39,843
Hey, wait up. Where the
hell you think you're going?

247
00:17:39,847 --> 00:17:40,941
I gotta take a leak.

248
00:17:40,944 --> 00:17:41,998
Hurry back.

249
00:17:43,382 --> 00:17:44,840
Whoa, whoa!

250
00:17:45,382 --> 00:17:47,890
Hey, you think
you own the damn road?

251
00:17:48,519 --> 00:17:50,115
Pardon me.

252
00:17:51,288 --> 00:17:53,782
Here we are, Maestro.
Uh-huh.

253
00:17:53,926 --> 00:17:55,327
Oh, bellman!

254
00:17:55,328 --> 00:17:56,402
Heh, heh.

255
00:17:58,235 --> 00:18:01,136
You out did yourself.
Nice choice too.

256
00:18:01,305 --> 00:18:02,597
My favorite color.

257
00:18:04,007 --> 00:18:06,099
You are <i>the</i> man.

258
00:18:06,241 --> 00:18:08,539
Let's take a ride. Get in!

259
00:18:08,788 --> 00:18:09,992
(LAUGHING)
Hey!

260
00:18:12,677 --> 00:18:15,167
Sorry, kid, I really don't know
what you're talking about.

261
00:18:15,445 --> 00:18:16,380
Quit fooling around, huh?

262
00:18:17,881 --> 00:18:20,780
Hey, Tyson.
What are you doing down there?

263
00:18:20,781 --> 00:18:23,349
Huh?
You and your stupid jokes. Take that!

264
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:24,315
It's not funny!

265
00:18:24,487 --> 00:18:25,784
Hey!
Rolling me on the ground like that!

266
00:18:28,002 --> 00:18:29,852
Hey!

267
00:18:29,855 --> 00:18:31,254
I'm so sorry.

268
00:18:37,864 --> 00:18:39,961
<i>Good morning, sir.
Welcome.</i>

269
00:18:39,964 --> 00:18:40,430
Yes.

270
00:18:40,434 --> 00:18:41,731
This way...

271
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:48,258
Not 100...
400,000 shares.

272
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:52,457
Ah, there you are, John!
(CHUCKLING) I remember you!

273
00:18:52,596 --> 00:18:53,494
Still well?

274
00:18:53,631 --> 00:18:55,725
I'm good. We haven't seen
each other in a long time.

275
00:18:55,867 --> 00:18:58,267
Oh, come on over here.
Look. Do you recognize her?

276
00:18:58,738 --> 00:19:02,139
She's the same girl you used
to play with, when you were a kid.

277
00:19:02,241 --> 00:19:05,038
Tammy, go on and say " hello " to John.
Go on!

278
00:19:06,911 --> 00:19:09,902
Oh, come on, a nice, big kiss.
That's better.

279
00:19:09,904 --> 00:19:11,902
She finished her training
as a nurse.

280
00:19:11,983 --> 00:19:14,984
When she heard you were coming, she
quit her job, just to take care of you.

281
00:19:15,086 --> 00:19:16,383
That's nice,
but I feel fine.

282
00:19:16,588 --> 00:19:20,191
Now, John, there are a lot of diseases
in this part of the world.

283
00:19:20,226 --> 00:19:25,216
You're a world famous conductor. You
really can't afford to catch anything.

284
00:19:25,227 --> 00:19:26,921
It would be terrible, if you did.

285
00:19:27,064 --> 00:19:28,463
Please, I would like
to freshen up first.

286
00:19:28,565 --> 00:19:31,863
Oh, I'm sorry, I forgot.
We'll talk later, huh?

287
00:19:32,304 --> 00:19:33,996
Oh, Tammy, will you show
some interest?

288
00:19:34,039 --> 00:19:35,438
Daddy, I already have a boyfriend.

289
00:19:35,607 --> 00:19:38,508
I'm helping you get a husband,
not a boyfriend.

290
00:19:38,610 --> 00:19:39,702
What about Rocky?

291
00:19:39,811 --> 00:19:40,903
Who? Stallone?

292
00:19:40,979 --> 00:19:44,380
Not Stallone. Frankie Lok.
I call him Rocky.

293
00:19:44,416 --> 00:19:47,908
Even Rocky would tell you to go for it.
Now, take this medicine bag.

294
00:19:48,119 --> 00:19:50,019
Your daddy's very serious about this.

295
00:19:50,323 --> 00:19:52,314
I want you and John to hit it off.

296
00:19:52,458 --> 00:19:56,450
We'll have a merger with the Ma family,
and both our businesses will prosper.

297
00:19:56,594 --> 00:19:58,394
And we'll be one big, happy corporation...
I mean, family.

298
00:19:58,499 --> 00:20:01,490
It's a very tough business world
we live in, my dear..

299
00:20:01,601 --> 00:20:03,593
John, are you there?
My daughter's here to see you.

300
00:20:03,775 --> 00:20:06,675
Now, you remember. Be nice to him.
Daddy, daddy.

301
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:07,588
Go on, get in there.
(SHOUTING)

302
00:20:11,748 --> 00:20:13,147
Oh, God, I hope it works.

303
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:18,662
Here, let me help you with this.

304
00:20:18,664 --> 00:20:21,541
So many bottles.
I thought your father was kidding.

305
00:20:21,719 --> 00:20:24,210
I didn't know nurses were so sexy
these days. You're showing.

306
00:20:25,355 --> 00:20:27,846
No, up here.
Oh!

307
00:20:28,826 --> 00:20:31,125
Even when I was a child,
I hardly needed vitamins or medicine.

308
00:20:32,730 --> 00:20:34,130
If I had known, I wouldn't
have brought so many.

309
00:20:34,265 --> 00:20:36,459
Come on, sit over here.

310
00:20:36,604 --> 00:20:37,998
Thank you.

311
00:20:41,004 --> 00:20:44,303
Your dress is a bit tight.
Must restrict the circulation.

312
00:20:44,608 --> 00:20:46,200
And your posture's not too good.

313
00:20:46,477 --> 00:20:49,275
That's probably why you often
get a sore back. Am I right?

314
00:20:50,013 --> 00:20:52,105
How'd you know that?
Hmm, come with me.

315
00:20:52,448 --> 00:20:54,349
Lie down, please.
So soon?

316
00:20:54,370 --> 00:20:56,112
Oh. Oh!

317
00:20:57,122 --> 00:21:00,716
Don't worry. No need to rush.
We'll go slowly.

318
00:21:04,191 --> 00:21:05,183
Oh!

319
00:21:05,786 --> 00:21:06,840
Ooh!

320
00:21:07,064 --> 00:21:09,090
Put your leg up here.
Just relax.

321
00:21:10,092 --> 00:21:12,580
(CRACKING)
(SCREAMING)

322
00:21:12,603 --> 00:21:13,797
I'm almost done.

323
00:21:13,904 --> 00:21:15,496
Wouldn't it be easier
with my clothes off?

324
00:21:15,873 --> 00:21:17,067
No need to.

325
00:21:20,345 --> 00:21:22,540
(MOANING)

326
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:24,079
I'm just loosening you up.

327
00:21:26,518 --> 00:21:28,213
It improves
the circulation.

328
00:21:29,788 --> 00:21:30,982
Are we ready yet?

329
00:21:31,890 --> 00:21:33,987
Feels pretty good,
don't you think?

330
00:21:40,496 --> 00:21:41,693
Asleep already?

331
00:21:41,967 --> 00:21:44,958
You must be very tired.

332
00:21:49,606 --> 00:21:53,699
I can't believe just because
we don't have the $300,000,

333
00:21:53,809 --> 00:21:55,106
we have to run away
to China.

334
00:21:55,210 --> 00:21:58,610
That's a real joke.
Hey, I didn't drive that bad.

335
00:21:58,679 --> 00:22:03,082
I mean, so we came in second.
I mean, what's so wrong with that?

336
00:22:03,184 --> 00:22:04,882
Did we win anything for it?
Not really.

337
00:22:04,888 --> 00:22:06,982
Oh, hey, here. Hold this
for me for a second, will ya?

338
00:22:07,153 --> 00:22:08,950
Oh, my back.

339
00:22:09,325 --> 00:22:11,623
Hi, I slept so well after that
workout you gave me last night.

340
00:22:11,894 --> 00:22:14,086
Would you like to see a menu?

341
00:22:14,088 --> 00:22:15,286
Mm-hmm.

342
00:22:15,530 --> 00:22:18,424
Let's go! I ain't got all day.
I'm busy. Talk to him.

343
00:22:19,365 --> 00:22:21,730
What's he saying?
I'm out of breath. Talk to him.

344
00:22:21,736 --> 00:22:23,635
Where's my money, huh?
Tyson, give him the money.

345
00:22:23,642 --> 00:22:25,940
You got the money.
No, you have it.

346
00:22:26,043 --> 00:22:27,533
Oh, right.

347
00:22:29,711 --> 00:22:31,810
Wait. I'll give you half now...
What are you doing?

348
00:22:31,816 --> 00:22:34,215
Listen here. I know the boat's stolen.
I hope you can appreciate it.

349
00:22:34,418 --> 00:22:36,612
Uh, huh. Call me when you get
to the mainland.

350
00:22:37,019 --> 00:22:41,815
Do you remember Barbara's last name?
Barbara Whatchamacallit.

351
00:22:41,954 --> 00:22:42,852
You fueled the tank,

You're not going anywhere.
What are we gonna do now?

366
00:23:28,215 --> 00:23:29,614
There's no way out.
We should just go ashore.

367

Either way we're going to die.
What?

00:32:38,759 --> 00:32:41,659
Nobody messes around with my girl.
Get back here, you son of a bitch.

526
00:32:41,661 --> 00:32:43,553
Rocky, wait!
Come back here.

527
00:32:44,290 --> 00:32:45,432
Hey!

528
00:32:45,434 --> 00:32:47,385
Stop it!
Hey!

529
00:32:47,387 --> 00:32:48,366
Stand back.

530
00:32:48,368 --> 00:32:50,359
Tammy, I'm gonna show you
what a real man is.

531
00:32:50,362 --> 00:32:52,575
You better run,
or he's gonna kill you.

532
00:32:55,244 --> 00:32:57,235
Now, Tammy!
You look great.

533
00:32:57,647 --> 00:32:59,137
Be right back.

534
00:33:01,608 --> 00:33:02,724
Wait!

535
00:33:05,315 --> 00:33:07,111
What's going on?

536
00:33:08,285 --> 00:33:10,085
Why are you defending me?
I don't even know you.

537
00:33:10,889 --> 00:33:12,290
Tammy!

538
00:33:14,704 --> 00:33:16,872
You better run. I'll hold him for you.
What?

539
00:33:16,874 --> 00:33:18,466
Go on! Run!
What?

540
00:33:18,468 --> 00:33:20,554
You are really hurting
my pride now, Miss.

541
00:33:23,210 --> 00:33:25,108
(GROANING)

542
00:33:36,379 --> 00:33:38,075
You forgot your change, Mister.

543
00:33:38,148 --> 00:33:40,046
I don't want it.
Thank you, sir.

544
00:33:41,667 --> 00:33:43,224
Here, you hold her.

545
00:33:43,226 --> 00:33:44,994
Haven't you had enough yet?

546
00:33:49,004 --> 00:33:50,998
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

547
00:33:52,024 --> 00:33:54,318
Wait. I don't even know you.

548
00:33:54,425 --> 00:33:56,619
So what? I don't care.

549
00:33:57,696 --> 00:33:59,594
Excuse me.

550
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:03,589
Hey.

551
00:34:07,338 --> 00:34:09,533
Why are you in such a hurry?
You didn't pay the bill?

552
00:34:09,536 --> 00:34:10,571
No, I did not.

553
00:34:10,741 --> 00:34:13,539
Hey, where'd you get that jacket?
Did you steal it?

554
00:34:13,711 --> 00:34:14,905
What are you talking about?
Cut it out.

555
00:34:15,012 --> 00:34:18,914
Wow!
That's a great car.

556
00:34:19,049 --> 00:34:21,643
Cool!
Whose is it?

557
00:34:24,002 --> 00:34:26,018
I can't believe it.
Does it belong to a lawyer?

558
00:34:26,157 --> 00:34:27,351
Can I drop you somewhere?

559
00:34:27,491 --> 00:34:30,392
What a car!
Real leather.

560
00:34:33,498 --> 00:34:34,893
Stop fighting...

561
00:34:35,866 --> 00:34:37,265
Excuse me!

562
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:44,434
Come on now.
You shouldn't do this.

563
00:34:44,575 --> 00:34:46,065
Why don't you tell him that.

564
00:34:46,072 --> 00:34:48,432
Aghhh!

565
00:34:50,281 --> 00:34:52,272
Wait, I really have no idea
who you are.

566
00:34:52,416 --> 00:34:53,405
Ahh.

567
00:34:58,956 --> 00:34:59,752
Aghh!

568
00:35:01,759 --> 00:35:02,851
Now, you're going to get it!

569
00:35:07,832 --> 00:35:09,026
You shouldn't do this!

570
00:35:09,066 --> 00:35:10,563
We'll finish this.

571
00:35:10,566 --> 00:35:11,998
Huh?

572
00:35:15,072 --> 00:35:16,970
No harm, no pain.

573
00:35:22,002 --> 00:35:23,008
Ohh...

574
00:35:23,010 --> 00:35:24,670
Don't you ever try to
come across me again.

575
00:35:24,782 --> 00:35:25,874
Who want this now, huh?

576
00:35:28,385 --> 00:35:29,579
You cause trouble everywhere.

577
00:35:35,726 --> 00:35:38,627
Hey, I'm warning you.
You'd better stop. Come on.

578
00:35:38,990 --> 00:35:40,002
Oh.

579
00:35:41,004 --> 00:35:42,912
Oh.

580
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:44,962
Ohh!

581
00:35:46,070 --> 00:35:47,560
I don't want to
hurt you any more.

582
00:35:48,506 --> 00:35:49,905
Will you stop it!

583
00:35:50,074 --> 00:35:51,974
My stuff is all broke.
Someone's got to pay.

584
00:35:51,977 --> 00:35:53,175
Come on.

585
00:36:01,184 --> 00:36:03,084
Look, you'd better pay this.
Right now.

586
00:36:11,896 --> 00:36:13,090
That guy's crazy.

587
00:36:13,497 --> 00:36:16,794
I never knew you were so strong.
Miss, what are you doing?

588
00:36:17,332 --> 00:36:19,425
I really like what I
found out about you.

589
00:36:20,868 --> 00:36:21,723
Well, alright.

590
00:36:21,939 --> 00:36:24,037
What do you want from me?

591
00:36:24,808 --> 00:36:26,400
Don't treat me like that.

592
00:36:26,944 --> 00:36:29,941
Well, whatever you say.

593
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,002
Hmm...

594
00:36:31,916 --> 00:36:32,814
Please, tell me your name?

595
00:36:32,983 --> 00:36:36,885
Boomer. Will you stop
fooling around, punk!

596
00:36:38,589 --> 00:36:40,580
My name's, John Ma,
not Boomer.

597
00:36:40,724 --> 00:36:42,123
So, where can I drop you off?

598
00:36:42,293 --> 00:36:43,885
At the hospital.

599
00:36:44,295 --> 00:36:46,286
Why? Are you sick?

600
00:36:46,430 --> 00:36:48,421
You asked me to go see Tyson.

601
00:36:48,499 --> 00:36:49,796
Oh, really?

602
00:36:50,668 --> 00:36:51,965
Bad acting talent.
You're not an actor.

603
00:36:52,336 --> 00:36:54,929
I know, I've played piano
since I was eight.

604
00:36:54,932 --> 00:36:57,888
The Royal Music Conservatory
at age twelve.

605
00:36:57,890 --> 00:37:01,839
At twenty, I won the
Beethoven Conductor Award.

606
00:37:01,911 --> 00:37:03,606
Like you have lots of money?

607
00:37:04,008 --> 00:37:06,002
Well...?

608
00:37:06,004 --> 00:37:08,480
Oh course, you went to school
and studied over-seas then?

609
00:37:08,485 --> 00:37:11,578
How did you know?
Oh, of course!

610
00:37:12,808 --> 00:37:14,002
Oh...

611
00:37:15,201 --> 00:37:17,544
Wow. This place!

612
00:37:19,036 --> 00:37:21,938
You made me feel so good the other day.
Would you mind doing it again?

613
00:37:22,073 --> 00:37:24,564
I don't know what
you're talking about, lady.

614
00:37:24,566 --> 00:37:25,974
I'm just a mechanic.

615
00:37:25,976 --> 00:37:27,466
I'll go lie down and wait.

616
00:37:32,983 --> 00:37:35,884
This joke's gone further
than I thought.

617
00:37:36,754 --> 00:37:38,153
I might just have to go for it.

618
00:37:38,802 --> 00:37:41,453
I'll fix her motor.

619
00:37:44,002 --> 00:37:46,112
Wow, what a place.
This is great.

620
00:37:50,934 --> 00:37:53,334
Hey, you know that's
very good, Beethoven?

621
00:37:53,904 --> 00:37:55,098
Beethoven.

622
00:38:07,451 --> 00:38:09,446
Stop!
What is it?

623
00:38:09,853 --> 00:38:11,451
Continue!

624
00:38:16,002 --> 00:38:17,904
Stop!

625
00:38:18,962 --> 00:38:21,260
I'm sorry, go on.
OK!

626
00:38:54,998 --> 00:38:57,224
Ugh.

627
00:38:58,302 --> 00:38:59,894
Your turn.
Try it!

628
00:39:00,003 --> 00:39:01,908
You want me...?

629
00:39:04,112 --> 00:39:05,908
No.. I can't!

630
00:39:06,278 --> 00:39:07,370
Sit down!

631
00:39:26,681 --> 00:39:30,378
I can't wait any longer!
Hurry up! Huh?

632
00:39:30,753 --> 00:39:33,050
(SNORTS)
Alright!

633
00:39:40,365 --> 00:39:42,363
Huh... huh? Ahhh!
YAieee!

634
00:39:46,434 --> 00:39:47,924
Huh... ohh.

635
00:39:55,438 --> 00:39:57,133
Hmph... mmm?

636
00:40:10,742 --> 00:40:12,876
I didn't know you drank

637
00:40:12,890 --> 00:40:14,992
and smoked.

638
00:40:15,008 --> 00:40:18,336
Always after a work-out.

639
00:40:19,002 --> 00:40:21,004
A workout, that's all it was?

640
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:22,231
Hey, you're the one
who asked me up here.

641
00:40:22,943 --> 00:40:24,740
That was very different
than the last time.

642
00:40:25,045 --> 00:40:26,637
You mean, we've done this before?

643
00:40:27,381 --> 00:40:30,008
Stop it.
What do you think I am?

644
00:40:30,012 --> 00:40:31,147
I didn't think anything,
so what's the matter?

645
00:40:31,451 --> 00:40:33,749
Huh?

646
00:40:33,751 --> 00:40:34,818
Nothing?

647
00:40:34,821 --> 00:40:36,618
Aren't you going to get that?

648
00:40:37,660 --> 00:40:39,653
Oh. I got to go.

649
00:40:39,826 --> 00:40:41,418
What concert are you talking about?

650
00:40:41,461 --> 00:40:42,758
The one I'll be conducting.

651
00:40:42,829 --> 00:40:44,830
Alright. No more jokes, ok?

652
00:40:45,832 --> 00:40:49,196
Boomer, I thought I told you,
I never wanted to see you in here again.

653
00:40:49,336 --> 00:40:52,902
Mister, you are really impolite.
You are Mister... uh?

654
00:40:52,904 --> 00:40:54,096
Security!
Come on, let's get...

655
00:40:54,098 --> 00:40:55,435
We have a problem.

656
00:40:55,542 --> 00:40:58,032
What seems to be the problem?

657
00:40:58,044 --> 00:41:00,000
I know this man,
he's always trouble around here.

658
00:41:00,180 --> 00:41:01,477
Mr. Ma?!
Yes!

659
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:03,378
There must be
some kind of mistake.

660
00:41:03,380 --> 00:41:04,949
Mr. Ma, is
the world famous Conductor.

661
00:41:05,052 --> 00:41:07,349
You should apologize?

662
00:41:07,521 --> 00:41:08,818
Sorry!

663
00:41:08,889 --> 00:41:10,186
Let's get back to work.
Yes, sir!

664
00:41:11,458 --> 00:41:13,551
Mr. Ma, it's an honor!

665
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:16,751
Thank you for your help.
Don't bother our guests.

666
00:41:17,004 --> 00:41:18,758
I am sorry!
I have to go back to my room.

667
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:21,965
By the way, your concert
has been filled to capacity.

668
00:41:22,033 --> 00:41:23,434
That's right, I almost forgot.
Thank you.

669
00:41:24,171 --> 00:41:26,969
If you need anything special,
please, don't forget to ask.

670
00:41:28,041 --> 00:41:29,235
Welcome, Miss!

671
00:41:30,744 --> 00:41:32,234
Why do they all know you?

672
00:41:32,379 --> 00:41:33,471
I really need some good help.

673
00:41:34,514 --> 00:41:36,913
These clothes are ridiculous.

674
00:41:36,915 --> 00:41:37,810
Let's get one thing straight,

675
00:41:37,812 --> 00:41:39,117
I don't have to be your slave,
just because I slept with you.

676
00:41:39,119 --> 00:41:41,011
What are you talking about?

677
00:41:41,354 --> 00:41:42,743
Give me a kiss.

678
00:41:42,822 --> 00:41:44,313
Stay still will you, there are people
waiting for you to perform.

679
00:41:44,424 --> 00:41:46,221
Perform?
Now, we gotta do it in public?

680
00:41:46,326 --> 00:41:48,123
Hey, be careful!

681
00:41:48,261 --> 00:41:50,957
Let's go, come on, hurry, hurry...
Where are we going?

682
00:41:53,700 --> 00:41:56,294
So, how much did you pay him
to get him to put on that show?

683
00:41:56,503 --> 00:41:57,902
My room here costs four hundred a day.

684
00:41:58,071 --> 00:42:00,369
Four hundred?
Yes, U.S. dollars.

685
00:42:03,004 --> 00:42:06,344
You look like a Conductor.
What do you mean look like?

686
00:42:06,346 --> 00:42:08,652
I really am a Conductor.
I wasn't kidding, you know.

687
00:42:08,654 --> 00:42:11,008
I know you're teasing me,
but I love that.

688
00:42:13,980 --> 00:42:18,220
I don't know why I let her push me around.
How did I get myself into this mess?

689
00:42:18,224 --> 00:42:20,324
Anyways, she is pretty.

690
00:42:24,002 --> 00:42:25,544
Not again.

691
00:42:44,002 --> 00:42:45,000
Ahh!
Ahh!

692
00:42:45,002 --> 00:42:46,552
Ghost!
You look just like me.

693
00:42:46,554 --> 00:42:49,212
We're even dressed the same.

694
00:42:53,340 --> 00:42:54,886
Weird.

695
00:42:54,890 --> 00:42:57,004
I don't know about you,
but I think I am going crazy.

696
00:42:57,006 --> 00:42:59,784
Wow!
It's strange isn't it?

697
00:43:00,004 --> 00:43:02,766
Hey, imagine.
I could be taken for you.

698
00:43:02,810 --> 00:43:04,000
Ah.

699
00:43:04,002 --> 00:43:07,112
No wonder the girl out there
thinks I am a musician.

700
00:43:07,114 --> 00:43:09,006
She certainly thinks I'm you.
(SNORTS)

701
00:43:09,010 --> 00:43:10,364
Ah.

702
00:43:10,366 --> 00:43:13,000
That's why the girl doesn't believe
I'm giving a concert.

703
00:43:13,010 --> 00:43:14,100
Ah.

704
00:43:14,204 --> 00:43:16,112
You play in a band.

705
00:43:16,114 --> 00:43:17,586
A band?
Never mind.

706
00:43:17,588 --> 00:43:19,224
Well, whatever you gotta do.

707
00:43:19,226 --> 00:43:21,002
What do you mean?
You're wearing my clothes.

708
00:43:21,004 --> 00:43:23,108
You have to give them
back to me and fix things up.

709
00:43:24,112 --> 00:43:26,540
Ok, but don't tell the girl
I'm with, alright?

710
00:43:27,110 --> 00:43:29,084
Wait, do you know a Barbara?

711
00:43:29,112 --> 00:43:31,022
What? You mean you know her?

712
00:43:31,086 --> 00:43:32,204
I'm pretty sure, that's her name.

713
00:43:32,206 --> 00:43:34,680
She got into my car and asked me
to take her to the hospital.

714
00:43:34,682 --> 00:43:36,872
To see this guy, Tyson.

715
00:43:37,588 --> 00:43:39,770
It's getting awfully confusing.

716
00:43:40,002 --> 00:43:41,010
Aaa... choo!

717
00:43:41,388 --> 00:43:42,440
Aah... choo!

718
00:43:46,860 --> 00:43:49,004
How come when I sneeze, you sneeze?

719
00:43:49,006 --> 00:43:50,318
That's right!

720
00:43:50,888 --> 00:43:52,480
Were you on a boat lately?

721
00:43:52,523 --> 00:43:53,421
You're right!

722
00:43:53,423 --> 00:43:54,786
Oh. My God!

723
00:43:54,788 --> 00:43:56,859
No wonder I was sea-sick.

724
00:43:57,095 --> 00:43:58,790
What do you do when I get laid?

725
00:43:59,264 --> 00:44:00,253
You mean with a girl?

726
00:44:00,398 --> 00:44:02,195
Of course, what else would I mean?

727
00:44:02,200 --> 00:44:03,780
Ho... Ho... Ho... Ho... Ho!

728
00:44:03,802 --> 00:44:06,201
Hope he's not too kinky.

729
00:44:06,204 --> 00:44:08,012
Oh, wait! Wait!

730
00:44:08,039 --> 00:44:10,112
Hey, you'd better get
your hand off me.

731
00:44:10,114 --> 00:44:11,811
You're forgetting your phone.

732
00:44:12,814 --> 00:44:14,903
Thanks a lot!

733
00:44:20,115 --> 00:44:21,712
Ah... Maestro!
Right on schedule!

734
00:44:25,188 --> 00:44:26,486
Hey!

735
00:44:26,504 --> 00:44:28,384
Are you ready?
Barbara?

736
00:44:28,396 --> 00:44:29,596
What are you doing here?
Are you serious?

737
00:44:29,731 --> 00:44:31,632
Is there something wrong with me?

738
00:44:33,702 --> 00:44:34,602
What's going on here?

739
00:44:34,604 --> 00:44:35,902
Why do I have to remind
you of every little detail?

740
00:44:36,704 --> 00:44:38,002
Just a second.

741
00:44:40,140 --> 00:44:41,234
Hello.

742
00:44:41,236 --> 00:44:43,491
<i>Who is this </i>?
Who is this?

743
00:44:43,494 --> 00:44:45,732
<i>Better get your ass down here.
We've been looking for you.</i>

744
00:44:45,734 --> 00:44:48,297
Oh no, I'm no Boomer.
You've got the wrong number.

745
00:44:49,674 --> 00:44:51,268
Huh?
This phone isn't mine.

746
00:44:51,270 --> 00:44:52,662
They got switched around.

747
00:44:56,444 --> 00:44:57,240
You just wait right here!

748
00:44:57,242 --> 00:44:58,402
Wait!

749
00:44:58,589 --> 00:45:00,681
Ya, Boomer?

750
00:45:01,224 --> 00:45:02,310
<i>Where are you </i>?

751
00:45:02,312 --> 00:45:04,315
I'm in the lobby with Barbara,
just tell me where you are?

752
00:45:04,360 --> 00:45:05,554
I'm in the car with Tammy.

753
00:45:05,761 --> 00:45:07,457
Get in here. I have to protect her.
And make it fast.

754
00:45:07,864 --> 00:45:10,765
You gotta take her with you,
it's getting too dangerous.

755
00:45:10,900 --> 00:45:11,798
But, I can't go inside.

756
00:45:12,001 --> 00:45:13,593
I need your help to
explain something to her.

757
00:45:13,770 --> 00:45:14,862
I understand.

758
00:45:14,971 --> 00:45:16,768
I've got more than
I can handle, right now.

759
00:45:16,900 --> 00:45:17,902
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)
What?

760
00:45:18,330 --> 00:45:19,404
What?

761
00:45:19,476 --> 00:45:21,671
John, John? Hello?
Damn it the battery is dead.

762
00:45:22,846 --> 00:45:25,837
Wait a second,
I need to change the phone.

763
00:45:26,516 --> 00:45:28,211
Wait, please! We're going to be late.

764
00:45:28,213 --> 00:45:29,850
I'll be right back.

765
00:45:29,853 --> 00:45:30,838
You stay right here. Don't go away.

766
00:45:30,840 --> 00:45:31,950
I'll be right back. Ok?
Where are you going?

767
00:45:42,866 --> 00:45:44,766
Ah... Maestro!
This way!

768
00:45:46,269 --> 00:45:47,861
That was quick.
Please, get in!

769
00:45:48,304 --> 00:45:49,896
Get in! Please!

770
00:45:49,898 --> 00:45:51,012
Thank you, sir.

771
00:45:51,474 --> 00:45:55,467
I was really getting worried.
We're going to be late.

772
00:45:55,612 --> 00:45:57,603
Driver, let's go!
Alright!

773
00:45:58,014 --> 00:45:59,003
Where are we going?

774
00:45:59,949 --> 00:46:01,246
To the concert.

775
00:46:04,354 --> 00:46:07,845
Is that Boomer I just saw leaving
right now, in that big car?

776
00:46:08,323 --> 00:46:09,722
Yeah, that was him alright.

777
00:46:12,362 --> 00:46:13,556
Then, who in the heck's that?

778
00:46:15,731 --> 00:46:20,430
Oh, Hi.
I thought, I just saw you leave?

779
00:46:21,770 --> 00:46:23,671
Barbara, I'm glad you're here.
I have to talk with you.

780
00:46:23,840 --> 00:46:25,330
Don't touch me.

781
00:46:25,475 --> 00:46:26,669
Does that mean you don't know us?

782
00:46:27,110 --> 00:46:28,304
Have we met before?

783
00:46:28,411 --> 00:46:30,504
We're holding your little friend,
so don't mess around?

784
00:46:30,647 --> 00:46:31,545
I'm not sure I understand.

785
00:46:31,714 --> 00:46:33,511
We're talking about Tyson.

786
00:46:41,750 --> 00:46:43,047
Don't you think you can
tell me where I'm going.

787
00:46:43,050 --> 00:46:44,880
To save someone for us.

788
00:46:44,882 --> 00:46:46,584
Sounds interesting.
Who's the lucky guy?

789
00:46:46,586 --> 00:46:49,282
Cops got our boss.
He's in that truck right there.

790
00:46:49,522 --> 00:46:52,514
No way, chase a policeman.
I'm not a race car driver.

791
00:46:52,658 --> 00:46:55,650
I heard you were the best.
Now, is the time to prove it.

792
00:46:55,728 --> 00:46:58,322
If you fail, Barbara and
Tyson are history.

793
00:46:58,464 --> 00:47:00,061
Don't get up tight!

794
00:47:00,066 --> 00:47:03,264
I'm not scared. You're the one
who needs to relax.

795
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:07,594
Oh, no! Too many people!
I'm getting out here!

796
00:47:07,907 --> 00:47:08,805
Why are you scared?

797
00:47:08,975 --> 00:47:09,772
Stop fooling around.

798
00:47:11,810 --> 00:47:14,611
Show me you're the famous John Ma.

799
00:47:14,615 --> 00:47:16,809
But, I'm not Maestro Ma.
I'm Boomer.

800
00:47:17,985 --> 00:47:19,977
Now get out there!

801
00:47:19,989 --> 00:47:22,482
Stop it!
I hate making jokes with my future.

802
00:47:23,260 --> 00:47:26,660
You've worked so hard,
all your life, for this night.

803
00:47:27,096 --> 00:47:31,588
Now, you get out there!
Show some guts!

804
00:47:32,467 --> 00:47:35,265
Fine, I'll go out there,
but you'll be sorry.

805
00:47:42,706 --> 00:47:44,196
Hey, where are you going?

806
00:47:44,977 --> 00:47:46,376
Wait!
So many people out there.

807
00:47:46,846 --> 00:47:48,939
You're baton.
What's that?

808
00:47:49,282 --> 00:47:51,078
Just wave it around.
You'll be alright.

809
00:47:51,216 --> 00:47:52,205
(SNORTS)

810
00:47:52,384 --> 00:47:53,874
Here goes nothing.

811
00:48:02,364 --> 00:48:04,558
Alright, let's move it!

812
00:48:15,017 --> 00:48:16,712
Withdraw! Pull back!

813
00:48:25,688 --> 00:48:27,485
We'll get you out of here, boss.

814
00:49:06,619 --> 00:49:08,711
Slow down!

815
00:49:13,971 --> 00:49:15,268
You wait for me
here and stay cool.

816
00:49:15,439 --> 00:49:17,236
Move it!

817
00:49:17,238 --> 00:49:18,502
What? What?
What's wrong with this door? Damn it!

818
00:49:18,676 --> 00:49:21,076
Unlock the door!
Thanks a lot.

819
00:49:43,168 --> 00:49:47,466
What? Are you sure you don't
have a reservation tonight after 9:00?

820
00:49:47,604 --> 00:49:50,299
Because, I specifically remember
calling back on Tuesday the...

821
00:49:50,406 --> 00:49:53,101
Ah!... Oh!

822
00:49:53,545 --> 00:49:54,637
Hurry up will ya!

823
00:49:58,417 --> 00:50:00,907
Tuesday, no, you don't
understand my position...

824
00:50:01,118 --> 00:50:03,210
Sorry, my turn. Go away!

825
00:50:10,286 --> 00:50:12,083
Hello?

826
00:50:12,089 --> 00:50:13,428
Is that you John?

827
00:50:13,698 --> 00:50:15,292
Hey, Boomer! I need your help
to get me out of here!

828
00:50:15,467 --> 00:50:18,367
I need you here!
You don't understand!

829
00:50:18,536 --> 00:50:20,731
They put me on stage. I'm
conducting your concert.

830
00:50:20,805 --> 00:50:22,602
It's all turning into a disaster.

831
00:50:22,640 --> 00:50:23,938
Just wave your hands
around, alright?

832
00:50:24,042 --> 00:50:25,236
What's happening to you?

833
00:50:25,444 --> 00:50:28,140
Get outside! Now!

834
00:50:30,442 --> 00:50:32,008
Phone dead.

835
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:45,180
Just wave my hands around.

836
00:51:12,619 --> 00:51:13,610
It's my concert.

837
00:51:13,688 --> 00:51:15,782
Do I know who this guy is?

838
00:51:16,339 --> 00:51:17,431
This is our big, big boss.

839
00:51:17,607 --> 00:51:18,802
You're Big Big Boss?
Uh... huh.

840
00:51:19,078 --> 00:51:22,376
Ok, hot shot, I want to go!

841
00:51:22,527 --> 00:51:23,620
Come on!

842
00:51:35,729 --> 00:51:37,630
That's it! That's it!
Stronger! Stronger!

843
00:51:37,708 --> 00:51:39,903
More feeling?

844
00:51:39,906 --> 00:51:43,224
Shut the hell up and drive!

845
00:51:50,049 --> 00:51:52,641
Hey, come on!
Quit foolin' around!

846
00:51:55,718 --> 00:51:56,618
Come on! Let's go!

847
00:51:58,371 --> 00:52:00,362
I'm sorry!
Watch out for the car!

848
00:52:49,303 --> 00:52:51,201
Are you alright? Boss!

849
00:52:51,304 --> 00:52:52,498
I'll go first!

850
00:52:52,500 --> 00:52:54,740
Start driving or I will kill you.
Get going!

851
00:53:08,721 --> 00:53:10,211
Hey, is that them?

852
00:53:13,259 --> 00:53:14,250
Step on the brake, step on it...

853
00:53:14,328 --> 00:53:16,226
Here. You do it!

854
00:53:16,329 --> 00:53:17,227
It's all yours!

855
00:53:17,363 --> 00:53:19,557
Hey, you guys!

856
00:53:19,563 --> 00:53:21,625
Now, we're on fire!

857
00:53:35,384 --> 00:53:36,681
Pull the hand-brake!

858
00:53:36,919 --> 00:53:39,216
Here, why don't
you do it, yourself.

859
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,908
Thank you. Thank you.

860
00:54:00,910 --> 00:54:02,012
Out of my way!

861
00:54:02,382 --> 00:54:04,576
Boss! We're coming!

862
00:54:13,004 --> 00:54:14,212
Bravo!

863
00:54:26,301 --> 00:54:28,099
Welcome, Mr. Ma!

864
00:54:28,872 --> 00:54:32,067
You could use a little freshening up
before the reception.

865
00:54:33,274 --> 00:54:35,265
We'll all be waiting in the
VIP room, for your arrival.

866
00:54:36,479 --> 00:54:38,971
Mr. Ma's back!

867
00:54:41,150 --> 00:54:42,549
Hello, my Dear.

868
00:54:42,651 --> 00:54:45,846
Hi, is the VIP Room ready yet
for the reception?

869
00:54:45,920 --> 00:54:47,818
Certainly it is ready... but?

870
00:54:47,955 --> 00:54:49,354
Wait a second.

871
00:54:49,393 --> 00:54:51,485
May I ask who you are?

872
00:54:51,660 --> 00:54:52,649
I'm John Ma.

873
00:54:54,530 --> 00:54:56,020
But, who is the man who
went to your room?

874
00:54:56,899 --> 00:54:59,093
Um...
Did he come back?

875
00:55:00,835 --> 00:55:02,826
I really think, we should
hurry up, for the press conference.

876
00:55:02,871 --> 00:55:04,168
I have to take a shower.
I'll be right back.

877
00:55:04,473 --> 00:55:05,667
John?!

878
00:55:07,002 --> 00:55:08,114
Thank you.

879
00:55:10,345 --> 00:55:11,243
Get in here, hurry..

880
00:55:14,216 --> 00:55:16,413
You can't believe,
what just happened to me.

881
00:55:16,488 --> 00:55:17,904
And what about me?

882
00:55:18,520 --> 00:55:20,317
I was almost killed.

883
00:55:20,688 --> 00:55:23,781
Let's forget about it.
And be ourselves.

884
00:55:23,991 --> 00:55:26,085
You're Boomer;
and I am John Ma, ok?

885
00:55:26,428 --> 00:55:28,820
Tell me...
Did you sleep with Barbara?

886
00:55:29,799 --> 00:55:31,391
No! We didn't do anything.
Good!

887
00:55:32,435 --> 00:55:34,335
Just hide yourself.

888
00:55:40,009 --> 00:55:41,203
It's Tammy!

889
00:55:41,477 --> 00:55:43,877
Don't you think,
you should go hide upstairs.

890
00:55:45,280 --> 00:55:47,078
OK.

891
00:55:53,355 --> 00:55:55,152
Hello.
It's me.

892
00:55:56,891 --> 00:55:59,088
Haven't you showered yet?
There's lots of people waiting.

893
00:55:59,161 --> 00:56:02,356
I know, you go down first
and I will join you soon.

894
00:56:02,534 --> 00:56:03,523
Hold it.

895
00:56:03,635 --> 00:56:05,829
Hmm... mm?

896
00:56:06,334 --> 00:56:08,112
Give me a kiss.

897
00:56:08,270 --> 00:56:10,464
(WHISPERS)
" You scum!"

898
00:56:11,240 --> 00:56:12,537
I'll wait downstairs.

899
00:56:17,447 --> 00:56:18,936
My purse?

900
00:56:21,951 --> 00:56:24,146
Hey, hold it!
Boomer, what are you doing?

901
00:56:24,553 --> 00:56:26,686
I'm filling the bath tub,
what does it look like?

902
00:56:26,689 --> 00:56:28,887
This whole situation is
getting out of hand.

903
00:56:29,114 --> 00:56:31,554
Hey, Boomer,
what do we do?

904
00:56:31,560 --> 00:56:33,859
This is ridiculous.

905
00:56:34,964 --> 00:56:36,261
I think I like Barbara a little.

906
00:56:36,264 --> 00:56:39,342
Don't even think about it.
Barbara is Tyson's girl, you hear?

907
00:56:42,477 --> 00:56:43,674
I don't even know Tyson.

908
00:56:44,815 --> 00:56:45,907
Wait a minute.

909
00:56:46,352 --> 00:56:48,907
When you touch Tyson's girl;
it's like you're touching my girl.

910
00:56:48,910 --> 00:56:51,611
So... stay away from her.
Do you hear?

911
00:56:52,008 --> 00:56:54,285
But, you touched my girl already.

912
00:56:54,725 --> 00:56:56,420
How could I know she's your girl.

913
00:56:56,560 --> 00:56:58,152
It doesn't matter whether,
she is or not.

914
00:56:59,996 --> 00:57:01,691
Don't mess around with her.

915
00:57:01,864 --> 00:57:02,263
Wait.
Come back.

916
00:57:02,399 --> 00:57:05,297
Are you telling me what to do?

917
00:57:05,500 --> 00:57:06,797
One minute!

918
00:57:08,972 --> 00:57:10,166
John Ma!

919
00:57:14,912 --> 00:57:16,004
Are you alright?

920
00:57:16,113 --> 00:57:17,307
I'm fine!
I'm fine!

921
00:57:17,309 --> 00:57:18,402
Huh?

922
00:57:19,783 --> 00:57:22,774
Why did you answer?
I'm John Ma.

923
00:57:22,776 --> 00:57:24,217
She really thinks I'm you, I answer.

924
00:57:24,521 --> 00:57:26,318
Hey, is there somebody
in there with you?

925
00:57:26,990 --> 00:57:30,185
Wait! Tammy, is my girl.
I'm the one she likes.

926
00:57:30,293 --> 00:57:33,484
Not you, but John Ma!
Not Boomer, you hear?

927
00:57:33,486 --> 00:57:37,331
I'm not so sure.
Besides, you already...

928
00:57:38,435 --> 00:57:40,130
So you want her to know that,

929
00:57:40,237 --> 00:57:42,228
she's been tricked. You impostor?

930
00:57:42,439 --> 00:57:43,637
John Ma!

931
00:57:44,004 --> 00:57:47,636
If you don't open the door,
I'll break it down!

932
00:57:47,642 --> 00:57:50,042
Uh... wait!
You'd better find a place to hide.

933
00:57:56,448 --> 00:57:58,642
You better not touch her.

934
00:58:00,833 --> 00:58:01,925
Why did you do that?
I'm sorry.

935
00:58:02,501 --> 00:58:03,598
Are you alright?
I'm fine!

936
00:58:03,804 --> 00:58:05,394
Who were you talking to?

937
00:58:08,407 --> 00:58:09,499
I fool you, didn't I.

938
00:58:09,609 --> 00:58:11,702
I only pretended to
be two different people.

939
00:58:11,911 --> 00:58:14,311
Not bad, hey? I've showered.
Let's go downstairs.

940
00:58:14,432 --> 00:58:15,660
Oh.

941
00:58:19,664 --> 00:58:20,870
Uh... oh.

942
00:58:20,880 --> 00:58:22,318
Tammy!
What are you doing?

943
00:58:22,320 --> 00:58:24,846
Now that I'm all wet. I need to take
a bath and change my clothes.

944
00:58:25,725 --> 00:58:26,817
A bath?

945
00:58:30,662 --> 00:58:32,760
Will you excuse me,
I also need to take one.

946
00:58:33,532 --> 00:58:36,524
I know.
Let's take one together.

947
00:58:37,303 --> 00:58:38,395
I change my mind.

948
00:58:38,904 --> 00:58:40,701
We took a bath together,
the other day.

949
00:58:41,207 --> 00:58:42,606
We did?
Are you sure about that?

950
00:58:43,410 --> 00:58:49,504
Yes, I am sure, and you didn't put your
hands all over me, you're were very nice.

951
00:58:49,713 --> 00:58:52,112
You dirty rat.
You took a bath with my girl.

952
00:58:52,348 --> 00:58:53,646
Huh?

953
00:58:54,085 --> 00:58:56,680
So, why are you undressed,
if you're not taking a bath?

954
00:58:56,856 --> 00:58:58,153
I guess I change my mind again.

955
00:58:58,791 --> 00:59:00,190
I really got to try
to figure you out.

956
00:59:04,800 --> 00:59:05,994
Hey!

957
00:59:06,996 --> 00:59:08,990
Why have you put your clothes back on?

958
00:59:11,736 --> 00:59:13,330
I need to keep them on, Tammy.

959
00:59:13,332 --> 00:59:15,036
Hmm?

960
00:59:16,539 --> 00:59:18,532
I must be seeing things.

961
00:59:20,848 --> 00:59:22,644
Oh...
What are you doing?

962
00:59:23,250 --> 00:59:24,239
Changing it!

963
00:59:24,418 --> 00:59:26,817
No, need to.
The water's clean.

964
00:59:27,486 --> 00:59:29,283
Didn't you just take a bath?

965
00:59:29,455 --> 00:59:32,357
I always fill it up after I'm done.

966
00:59:32,426 --> 00:59:34,620
It's just another habit of mine!

967
00:59:35,127 --> 00:59:37,528
There is so very much
I have to learn about you.

968
00:59:40,101 --> 00:59:43,193
So sweet.

969
00:59:43,703 --> 00:59:45,900
And I better start now,
since I'm already yours.

970
00:59:52,345 --> 00:59:55,002
Maybe it's better we don't
take a bath together.

971
00:59:55,004 --> 00:59:56,645
It could take us hours.

972
00:59:56,983 --> 00:59:58,881
The water is warm.

973
01:00:00,002 --> 01:00:00,998
Ah!

974
01:00:01,002 --> 01:00:02,004
Surprise!

975
01:00:02,955 --> 01:00:04,651
Let's take a bath together!

976
01:00:05,791 --> 01:00:07,985
You're so horrible.

977
01:00:08,561 --> 01:00:09,756
You're such a naughty boy.

978
01:00:09,830 --> 01:00:13,320
They're all waiting.
We don't have enough time.

979
01:00:13,322 --> 01:00:15,294
Forget about that.
Let go!

980
01:00:15,296 --> 01:00:16,492
Let's enjoy ourselves.

981
01:00:17,002 --> 01:00:18,754
Ah! Ah!

982
01:00:18,756 --> 01:00:19,904
Ah! Ah!

983
01:00:21,706 --> 01:00:23,697
It's just a reflection,
like in a movie.

984
01:00:24,808 --> 01:00:26,002
Mirror?!

985
01:00:26,906 --> 01:00:27,812
It's a mirror!

986
01:00:27,814 --> 01:00:29,774
You scared me to death.

987
01:00:29,776 --> 01:00:30,969
I'm awfully sorry!
I'm awfully sorry!

988
01:00:33,004 --> 01:00:34,000
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

989
01:00:34,002 --> 01:00:35,473
Who's that?

990
01:00:37,249 --> 01:00:38,341
Uh... Yes!

991
01:00:38,344 --> 01:00:39,890
May I help you, Miss?

992
01:00:41,286 --> 01:00:43,481
Where's Boomer?

993
01:00:44,227 --> 01:00:45,358
Who did you say
you're looking for?

994
01:00:46,360 --> 01:00:47,358
Boomer?

995
01:00:47,360 --> 01:00:48,759
There must be a mistake?

996
01:00:48,762 --> 01:00:50,689
I was here earlier today.

997
01:00:50,832 --> 01:00:52,628
Boomer!
Barbara!

998
01:00:52,766 --> 01:00:56,046
I wish you would leave.
I'm just here with my boyfriend.

999
01:00:56,048 --> 01:00:57,529
Boomer!
Where are you?

1000
01:00:57,637 --> 01:00:58,529
Here we go again.

1001
01:00:59,539 --> 01:01:01,034
Hey, Boomer!
Are you here?

1002
01:01:01,036 --> 01:01:02,084
Wait!!

1003
01:01:02,886 --> 01:01:03,650
Hello.

1004
01:01:04,654 --> 01:01:06,764
Do you know this woman?

1005
01:01:07,781 --> 01:01:08,873
What are you doing?

1006
01:01:09,783 --> 01:01:11,683
And what kind of girl,
do you think I am?

1007
01:01:13,053 --> 01:01:14,247
What is it?

1008
01:01:15,004 --> 01:01:17,346
Crazy Kung says, bring the
case to the dock,

1009
01:01:17,456 --> 01:01:18,447
because, if you don't,

1010
01:01:18,992 --> 01:01:19,584
Tyson will be dead.

1011
01:01:20,588 --> 01:01:22,806
Well, who is she?

1012
01:01:24,097 --> 01:01:27,294
What's wrong with you?
I thought you cared!

1013
01:01:27,434 --> 01:01:29,731
And now I find you here
with this woman!

1014
01:01:29,869 --> 01:01:30,463
You've got a problem.

1015
01:01:30,705 --> 01:01:34,902
Hey, wait a minute
I've had enough.

1016
01:01:35,642 --> 01:01:36,940
Who is she?

1017
01:01:36,943 --> 01:01:38,137
Barbara.

1018
01:01:38,578 --> 01:01:39,567
And what's her name?

1019
01:01:40,369 --> 01:01:41,668
She's Tammy.

1020
01:01:41,672 --> 01:01:42,977
His fiancée.

1021
01:01:43,185 --> 01:01:44,274
And we're going to get married.

1022
01:01:44,296 --> 01:01:45,760
You're getting married?

1023
01:01:46,453 --> 01:01:47,750
Wait! Barbara...

1024
01:01:48,221 --> 01:01:51,721
You promised me, remember?
You can't go back on your word!

1025
01:01:52,058 --> 01:01:53,956
Just close your eyes and imagine...

1026
01:01:54,093 --> 01:01:55,993
Did you tell her that?

1027
01:01:56,061 --> 01:01:58,259
We agreed on a Spring wedding?

1028
01:01:58,699 --> 01:02:01,691
There's something important
you should know.

1029
01:02:03,369 --> 01:02:05,066
Boomer!

1030
01:02:05,190 --> 01:02:06,366
Where are you?!

1031
01:02:06,784 --> 01:02:07,990
Boomer!

1032
01:02:08,002 --> 01:02:09,560
Where are you?

1033
01:02:09,573 --> 01:02:11,673
He could be behind you.

1034
01:02:11,776 --> 01:02:14,266
Yes, he's just afraid.
He was scared of girls, that's why.

1035
01:02:14,379 --> 01:02:17,075
Come on out!

1036
01:02:20,082 --> 01:02:21,379
You'll see.

1037
01:02:21,420 --> 01:02:22,121
Boomer!

1038
01:02:22,346 --> 01:02:24,998
I know you're there.
Come out.

1039
01:02:25,004 --> 01:02:26,083
Oh, no.

1040
01:02:26,533 --> 01:02:28,024
I think I'm losing my mind.

1041
01:02:34,002 --> 01:02:35,112
I...

1042
01:02:39,138 --> 01:02:40,732
Wait, I know...

1043
01:02:40,802 --> 01:02:42,110
TV.

1044
01:02:46,304 --> 01:02:48,122
Yes.

1045
01:02:50,188 --> 01:02:52,487
Huh?
Huh?

1046
01:02:52,534 --> 01:02:54,348
Oh...
Oh...

1047
01:02:54,688 --> 01:02:56,196
Huh?
Huh?

1048
01:02:56,642 --> 01:02:58,298
He's real.

1049
01:03:00,794 --> 01:03:02,886
Oh...
Oh...

1050
01:03:04,898 --> 01:03:07,598
Boomer, Tyson's in trouble.
You have to find Kung, quick!

1051
01:03:07,600 --> 01:03:09,597
If I only knew where
he was hiding?

1052
01:03:09,906 --> 01:03:12,330
Wait.
At the ship yards.

1053
01:03:12,332 --> 01:03:14,266
And you are suppose to
bring the briefcase with you.

1054
01:03:14,268 --> 01:03:15,270
Then you look after them.

1055
01:03:15,342 --> 01:03:16,741
Hold it.
Aren't you coming back?

1056
01:03:19,912 --> 01:03:21,311
If I survive, I will.

1057
01:03:24,881 --> 01:03:25,978
Mr. Ma! Mr. Ma!
Maestro! Maestro!

1058
01:03:25,980 --> 01:03:27,004
Excuse me.

1059
01:03:28,120 --> 01:03:29,917
Alright. Come to the
Conference room for the pictures!

1060
01:03:30,055 --> 01:03:31,545
Thank you for your co-operation.

1061
01:03:33,693 --> 01:03:35,489
Hi there!

1062
01:03:39,298 --> 01:03:40,487
Mr. Ma!
Maestro!

1063
01:03:40,899 --> 01:03:41,298
This way...

1064
01:03:47,012 --> 01:03:48,232
Ah... Maestro!
Mr. Ma!

1065
01:03:52,510 --> 01:03:54,680
Ah Maestro!
Boomer!

1066
01:03:56,582 --> 01:03:57,681
Boomer,

1067
01:03:58,606 --> 01:04:00,082
we should be like brothers.
We're so alike.

1068
01:04:00,488 --> 01:04:03,922
Fate, is a funny thing,
you know what I mean, cuz..

1069
01:04:03,924 --> 01:04:07,219
If I had as many brains as you...

1070
01:04:07,326 --> 01:04:10,023
I could have turned out pretty good.

1071
01:04:10,216 --> 01:04:13,988
I'm honored to know
someone as loyal as you.

1072
01:04:16,296 --> 01:04:18,993
Let's get this done, together.
As friends.

1073
01:04:22,420 --> 01:04:24,568
Let's go get Tyson.

1074
01:04:55,101 --> 01:04:56,295
How do you do?

1075
01:04:56,298 --> 01:04:57,904
Skip it.
We're wasting time.

1076
01:05:29,004 --> 01:05:30,998
It's good to see you again.

1077
01:05:31,749 --> 01:05:33,149
Will, bring the briefcase here.

1078
01:05:33,346 --> 01:05:34,420
I'll take that.

1079
01:05:34,652 --> 01:05:35,420
Hey, hey, hey!

1080
01:05:35,422 --> 01:05:36,821
I have a bomb!

1081
01:05:36,823 --> 01:05:37,884
Hand that over here.
All of you.

1082
01:05:37,886 --> 01:05:38,112
Back off!

1083
01:05:38,802 --> 01:05:40,912
Back off!
It's full of explosives!

1084
01:05:40,914 --> 01:05:42,988
Do you hear me?!
Don't come near me?!

1085
01:05:42,990 --> 01:05:44,187
If I drop it, we will all die!

1086
01:05:50,802 --> 01:05:53,398
I'll check the other side.
Yeah, fine.

1087
01:05:58,375 --> 01:06:00,866
What are you looking at?
Huh?

1088
01:06:15,058 --> 01:06:16,150
Where's Tyson?

1089
01:06:16,493 --> 01:06:18,085
He's up there!

1090
01:06:18,228 --> 01:06:20,925
Hey, Boomer!
Help me!

1091
01:06:21,065 --> 01:06:23,161
I'm stuck!

1092
01:06:24,303 --> 01:06:25,794
Up here!

1093
01:06:26,306 --> 01:06:28,001
Are you really, Tyson?

1094
01:06:29,074 --> 01:06:31,065
Don't kid around, Boomer!

1095
01:06:31,210 --> 01:06:33,804
Can you say something
to prove who you are?

1096
01:06:33,913 --> 01:06:35,512
Yeah, when we were kids...

1097
01:06:36,236 --> 01:06:41,112
AHHH!!!

1098
01:06:43,722 --> 01:06:45,314
He's such a crack-up, ain't he?

1099
01:06:52,793 --> 01:06:54,192
Hand over the briefcase, huh?

1100
01:06:54,395 --> 01:06:56,794
Or goodbye to your buddy,
you know what I mean?

1101
01:07:08,002 --> 01:07:09,006
Move over.

1102
01:07:10,431 --> 01:07:13,729
Hey, Boss! Boss we got trouble!
There's another guy!

1103
01:07:14,867 --> 01:07:16,566
Boomer, HELP!

1104
01:07:19,772 --> 01:07:21,175
Ah... help me!

1105
01:07:25,002 --> 01:07:26,807
That was your last chance.

1106
01:07:27,945 --> 01:07:30,140
Ahh!!
What have I done?

1107
01:07:34,416 --> 01:07:35,611
That was close.

1108
01:07:36,022 --> 01:07:38,812
Give me that case.

1109
01:07:39,988 --> 01:07:41,479
It's a bomb!

1110
01:07:44,735 --> 01:07:46,929
Any closer and
this will explode!

1111
01:07:48,705 --> 01:07:51,298
Alright, I've had about enough of this.
Get him!

1112
01:07:52,442 --> 01:07:53,842
Step aside!

1113
01:07:54,150 --> 01:07:55,242
Wait, take it easy, Boss.

1114
01:08:00,288 --> 01:08:01,778
No, wait.
Look at that.

1115
01:08:08,631 --> 01:08:09,724
Somebody, go check it out.

1116
01:08:10,910 --> 01:08:12,104
Go on!

1117
01:08:22,516 --> 01:08:24,313
Ahh!!

1118
01:08:28,762 --> 01:08:30,358
Go!
Go on, after him!

1119
01:08:52,206 --> 01:08:53,298
Now what?

1120
01:08:55,308 --> 01:08:57,299
Tyson, get out of here!

1121
01:09:01,411 --> 01:09:02,708
Let's get out of here.

1122
01:09:03,014 --> 01:09:04,912
I trying, but I hurt my leg.

1123
01:09:05,916 --> 01:09:09,315
Hey, what the hell?
How did you get down here, so fast?

1124
01:09:09,417 --> 01:09:11,317
What are you talking about?
I've been down here the whole time.

1125
01:09:11,753 --> 01:09:14,153
My leg. My leg.

1126
01:09:19,222 --> 01:09:20,519
Come on!

1127
01:09:38,657 --> 01:09:41,352
AHHH!

1128
01:09:55,002 --> 01:09:56,008
Alright, ...uh.

1129
01:10:00,002 --> 01:10:01,068
Alright, It's your play.

1130
01:10:01,492 --> 01:10:03,187
What's that?

1131
01:10:06,267 --> 01:10:07,564
Your turn.

1132
01:10:07,566 --> 01:10:08,742
Six.

1133
01:10:09,011 --> 01:10:10,410
There's somebody in here.

1134
01:10:13,545 --> 01:10:14,137
Come on.

1135
01:10:16,614 --> 01:10:18,605
Wait, there really is
somebody in here.

1136
01:10:18,916 --> 01:10:19,508
I'm not lying!

1137
01:10:19,510 --> 01:10:20,908
Hey, you!

1138
01:10:22,155 --> 01:10:24,350
Put your hands up!

1139
01:10:24,691 --> 01:10:25,680
Lunch break is over.

1140
01:10:26,599 --> 01:10:27,793
Put your head down!
Yes, sir.

1141
01:10:35,334 --> 01:10:36,528
Boomer, come on!

1142
01:10:38,974 --> 01:10:40,066
Come on! Let's go!

1143

Ta.. da.. da.. da..

1144
01:10:52,006 --> 01:10:53,787

Tyson!

1146
01:11:01,112 --> 01:11:02,204
It's so hot.

1147
01:11:02,324 --> 01:11:03,566
Hey, Boom...

1148
01:11:03,838 --> 01:11:05,416

01:11:30,934 --> 01:11:32,832
Over here!
Take him!

1152
01:11:35,002 --> 01:11:36,112
Ugh!

1153
01:11:40,977 --> 01:11:41,969
Tyson?

1154
01:11:42,954 --> 01:11:43,966
Tyson?

1155
01:11:45,114 --> 01:11:48,417
Hey here, I'm here, Boomer!
Hey, I'm here in the car!

1156
01:11:49,002 --> 01:11:50,484
Get in the car!
Get inside!

1157

What are you doing inside?

1158
01:11:52,421 --> 01:11:53,820
Let's drive our way
out of here, huh?

1159
01:11:54,657 --> 01:11:56,852
The car is raised up!
What are we going to do?

1160
01:11:56,854 --> 01:11:57,904
Huh?

1161
01:12:00,008 --> 01:12:01,091
Alright, check it out! Move it!

1162
01:12:03,633 --> 01:12:04,827
I can't see anything!

1163
01:12:04,934 --> 01:12:05,834
Shut up and keep looking.

1164
01:12:11,141 --> 01:12:12,116
Find anything?

1165
01:12:12,118 --> 01:12:13,010
No.

1166
01:12:18,818 --> 01:12:20,716
Oh, I'm sorry! Bye!

1167
01:12:30,423 --> 01:12:31,321
I'm sorry!

1168

What are you doing?

1169
01:12:32,899 --> 01:12:33,991
I didn't have much choice!

Boomer?

1174
01:12:55,604 --> 01:12:56,358

You want some of this?

Hey, what are you doing?
Kick him in the head!

Boomer, come back here!

1192
01:13:40,542 --> 01:13:42,841
You should be able to kill this guy.
Is something wrong?

You're fighting like a girl!

1194

My grandmother could beat
the shit out of this guy!

1195
01:13:51,248 --> 01:13:52,045
I... I was kidding.

1196
01:13:52,284 --> 01:13:54,683
I don't have a grandmother!

You bastard!

someone your own size?

Oh, heaven.

Wait!
How'd you get in here?

Watch while I do it, okay?

Get off me or die!

1249
01:20:27,407 --> 01:20:28,704
Boomer! Look out!!

1250
01:20:36,102 --> 01:20:38,399
Tyson!

1251
01:20:40,503 --> 01:20:42,695
Tyson?
Get up!

1252
01:20:42,697 --> 01:20:43,740

I had the seat belt on!
I had the seat belt on!

1258
01:20:56,002 --> 01:20:57,164
I'm going to be okay!

1259
01:20:58,238 --> 01:21:01,035
I'm going to kick your ass!

1260
01:21:01,038 --> 01:21:02,867
I've had enough.

1261
01:21:02,876 --> 01:21:04,470
Please, no more.
I'll make a deal.

1262

Take him!

01:21:32,771 --> 01:21:33,422
I got you.

1266
01:21:33,424 --> 01:21:34,568
Say your prayers now, buddy?

1267
01:21:36,175 --> 01:21:37,865
Boomer?

1268
01:21:48,446 --> 01:21:50,043
Hey!
There's two of them!

1269
01:21:50,187 --> 01:21:51,484
And only one can fight!

1270
01:21:51,758 --> 01:21:53,747
Then, which one do I have?

1271
01:21:53,892 --> 01:21:54,881
Oh.

1272
01:21:55,195 --> 01:21:57,594
The think I got the fighter.

1273
01:22:26,157 --> 01:22:27,852
He is not Boomer,
he cannot fight you.

1274
01:22:27,860 --> 01:22:29,050
Why don't you come fight me?

1275
01:22:36,134 --> 01:22:37,729
Look behind you!

1276
01:22:42,809 --> 01:22:44,510
Turn around!

1277
01:22:44,564 --> 01:22:46,062
John, Behind you!!

1278
01:22:52,102 --> 01:22:54,002

I move, he move.

1280
01:23:03,202 --> 01:23:05,002
Hit him! Hit him!

1281
01:23:05,644 --> 01:23:06,906
Harder!

1282
01:23:07,748 --> 01:23:08,648
Turn around!

1283
01:23:15,378 --> 01:23:18,171
Kick him.
Kick...

1284
01:23:19,890 --> 01:23:21,112

Oh.

1287
01:23:39,889 --> 01:23:42,481
I'm not done with you.

1288
01:23:45,832 --> 01:23:47,129
So...

1289
01:23:47,268 --> 01:23:48,964
Tell me, which one am I actually.

1290
01:23:49,004 --> 01:23:51,422
John Ma! Who do you think?

1291
01:23:51,611 --> 01:23:54,606
I wasn't really sure,
cause when I was fighting...

1292
01:23:54,720 --> 01:23:55,711
Cut the crap!

1293
01:23:56,556 --> 01:23:58,148
Open it up!

1294
01:23:58,150 --> 01:23:59,523
Okay.

1295
01:24:01,336 --> 01:24:03,234

1296
01:24:07,507 --> 01:24:08,405
Stop there!

There's just one of us.

1299

Just one?

You're seeing things.

1301
01:24:19,449 --> 01:24:20,643
Ah.

1302
01:24:20,821 --> 01:24:22,119
Get on the ground!

1303
01:24:22,359 --> 01:24:23,254
Move it!

1304
01:24:25,203 --> 01:24:26,500

Where is the seat belt?

1309
01:24:42,220 --> 01:24:43,998

What's taking them so long?

1314
01:25:10,045 --> 01:25:12,745
I'm very anxious to meet
the man who looks like John.

1315
01:25:12,947 --> 01:25:14,244
I hope he really is our son.

1316
01:25:14,349 --> 01:25:16,748
Now, momma. Don't get your
hopes up too high. You promised.

1317
01:25:16,750 --> 01:25:18,208
Yes, of course.
I won't.

1318
01:25:18,821 --> 01:25:19,416
Father, mother...

1319
01:25:19,418 --> 01:25:23,008
I still haven't seen Boomer.
I don't know where he is?

1320
01:25:26,110 --> 01:25:27,780
I'm afraid the wedding
will have to be cancelled.

1321
01:25:27,782 --> 01:25:28,702
Cancelled?!

1322
01:25:28,704 --> 01:25:31,731
Wait here, I have to find Boomer.

1323
01:25:33,067 --> 01:25:34,762
John!

1324
01:25:36,004 --> 01:25:37,142
Stop!

1325
01:25:42,502 --> 01:25:44,301
Where have you been?

1326
01:25:44,437 --> 01:25:45,927
(SNORTS) Did you have to
bring the whole crowd?

1327
01:25:46,072 --> 01:25:48,868
I can't believe it, our son?
That's our boy?

1328
01:25:53,041 --> 01:25:54,736
What do we do?

1329
01:25:54,738 --> 01:25:55,736
We get out of here, right now!

1330
01:25:55,738 --> 01:25:56,712
Let's go!

1331
01:25:57,281 --> 01:25:59,182
Are you alright?
They're getting away!

1332
01:26:02,717 --> 01:26:04,309
I've got you.
Are you Boomer or John?

1333
01:26:04,653 --> 01:26:06,247
You're not getting away that easy.
Come on.

1334
01:26:12,289 --> 01:26:13,781
That one's Boomer.

1335
01:26:13,783 --> 01:26:14,426
No, that's Boomer.
Or is it John?

1336
01:26:17,363 --> 01:26:18,455
Which one of you is John?

1337
01:26:22,565 --> 01:26:23,554

It doesn't make any difference!!
