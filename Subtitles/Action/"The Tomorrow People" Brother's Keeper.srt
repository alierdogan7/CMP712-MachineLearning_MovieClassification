176
00:09:15,093 --> 00:09:16,616
and then I hear this noise.

177
00:09:17,071 --> 00:09:19,222
Suddenly the door's
locked from the outside.

178
00:09:19,654 --> 00:09:22,084
I wouldn't beat myself
up if I were you.

179
00:09:22,359 --> 00:09:24,812
It's a professional hit. There's
nothing you could have done about it.

180
00:09:24,932 --> 00:09:26,410
But it just doesn't
make any sense.

181
00:09:26,778 --> 00:09:28,498
The killer must've been a ghost.

182
00:09:30,264 --> 00:09:31,806
MARSHAL: Wait, who are you?

183
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:34,115
Oh, I'm sorry.
Dr. Jedikiah Price.

184
00:09:34,235 --> 00:09:35,635
What kind of doctor?

185
00:09:36,237 --> 00:09:38,571
The kind who tracks ghosts.

186
00:09:51,388 --> 00:09:54,632
- Talk to me, mama. What's happening?
- I couldn't get close.

187
00:09:54,752 --> 00:09:56,918
Stephen and his Ultra gal-pal
were crowding the scene.

188
00:09:56,949 --> 00:09:58,341
But what do you think?

189
00:09:58,357 --> 00:10:00,390
Did a breakout actually
bump someone off?

190
00:10:00,510 --> 00:10:02,158
Clearly Jedikiah thinks so.

191
00:10:02,204 --> 00:10:04,100
It doesn't make sense. How?

192
00:10:04,410 --> 00:10:06,951
We can't rule out the possibility
of an evolutionary mutation.

193
00:10:06,990 --> 00:10:09,469
Whoa. You think Mother
Nature created, like,

194
00:10:09,493 --> 00:10:11,550
a Tomorrow Person 2.0?

195
00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:13,509
A Day-After-Tomorrow Person.

196
00:10:14,998 --> 00:10:17,430
There's nothing new and
improved about killing.

197
00:10:17,469 --> 00:10:19,649
Well, even Mother
Nature can brain-fart.

198
00:10:19,651 --> 00:10:21,551
Unless it wasn't nature at all.

199
00:10:21,553 --> 00:10:24,387
And what if he's another one out
of The Annex Project, like...

200
00:10:24,954 --> 00:10:28,450
Like that other guy that used
to hang out around here?

201
00:10:28,473 --> 00:10:31,953
Blond hair, blue eyes,
about yay tall.

202
00:10:33,096 --> 00:10:34,930
John's gone, Russell.

203
00:10:35,746 --> 00:10:39,101
(SIGHS) Poor guy's probably
dumpster diving for lunch.

204
00:10:42,957 --> 00:10:45,170
Mmm. Oh, man.

205
00:10:45,850 --> 00:10:46,850
Wow.

206
00:10:47,144 --> 00:10:49,178
- Horseradish?
- It's in the mustard.

207
00:10:50,046 --> 00:10:51,714
This is beyond a sandwich.

208
00:10:51,716 --> 00:10:52,948
(CHUCKLES)

209
00:10:53,725 --> 00:10:55,751
Honey, some lunch?

210
00:10:56,386 --> 00:10:57,566
I need to talk to John.

211
00:10:57,686 --> 00:10:59,004
All right. Well, John,

212
00:10:59,028 --> 00:11:00,600
good luck wherever you end up.

213
00:11:04,995 --> 00:11:06,771
Don't worry, you're staying.

214
00:11:06,891 --> 00:11:08,475
Okay? We're all staying.

215
00:11:09,132 --> 00:11:11,150
It seems like she's
got her mind made up.

216
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:13,567
Well, it's not
really her choice.

217
00:11:14,371 --> 00:11:15,938
Go easy on her, huh?

218
00:11:16,288 --> 00:11:17,766
The Annex Project,

219
00:11:17,886 --> 00:11:19,657
you said there
were no survivors.

220
00:11:19,777 --> 00:11:21,590
Other than me and Killian.

221
00:11:21,945 --> 00:11:23,553
Hey, what about after you?

222
00:11:23,928 --> 00:11:25,829
I'm tracking a
breakout who can kill.

223
00:11:25,876 --> 00:11:28,097
Maybe Ultra rebooted
the project.

224
00:11:28,128 --> 00:11:29,618
What does your boss say?

225
00:11:30,092 --> 00:11:32,133
Jedikiah denies knowing
anything about it.

226
00:11:32,253 --> 00:11:33,253
Hmm.

227
00:11:33,269 --> 00:11:35,636
- Which he would in any event.
- Exactly.

228
00:11:35,675 --> 00:11:37,236
So how will I know
what I'm up against.

229
00:11:38,061 --> 00:11:39,394
You won't.

230
00:11:40,406 --> 00:11:42,264
Until he tries to
slit my throat.

231
00:11:43,183 --> 00:11:45,536
That's why your uncle
was so hell-bent on

232
00:11:45,583 --> 00:11:47,319
weaponizing our species.

233
00:11:48,391 --> 00:11:50,839
We are the ultimate
killing machines.

234
00:11:59,059 --> 00:12:01,926
I was about two minutes away from
sending a TAC team out after you.

235
00:12:01,976 --> 00:12:03,878
- Not funny.
- Not joking.

236
00:12:04,172 --> 00:12:05,849
- Where are we?
- Nowhere.

237
00:12:05,905 --> 00:12:08,550
No signatures matching our
killer. The guy's under a rock.

238
00:12:08,727 --> 00:12:10,151
Sure about that?

239
00:12:10,491 --> 00:12:12,954
No teleports within
the last 12 hours.

240
00:12:13,545 --> 00:12:15,657
Try changing your
search parameters.

241
00:12:15,659 --> 00:12:17,792
Why would he use that
much energy to teleport?

242
00:12:17,794 --> 00:12:19,876
Because that's how much
he used last time.

243
00:12:20,796 --> 00:12:22,931
(GASPS) Oh. What...

244
00:12:23,365 --> 00:12:24,766
Did I break it?

245
00:12:24,768 --> 00:12:26,601
It was five minutes ago.

246
00:12:26,782 --> 00:12:28,303
Hillary, what happened?

247
00:12:28,804 --> 00:12:30,138
(CLUB MUSIC PLAYING)

248
00:12:30,645 --> 00:12:32,206
HILLARY: This place
is owned by the guy

249
00:12:32,208 --> 00:12:34,840
our dead witness was testifying
against in some mob trial.

250
00:12:34,858 --> 00:12:37,045
Maybe our hit man is here
to collect his money.

251
00:12:37,217 --> 00:12:40,007
With his lethal gene unlocked,
he's gonna have a leg up on us.

252
00:12:40,026 --> 00:12:42,450
Well, there's one of
him and two of us.

253
00:12:46,183 --> 00:12:48,159
- Did you feel that?
- Yeah, he's here.

254
00:12:48,184 --> 00:12:49,490
We should split up.

255
00:12:49,492 --> 00:12:52,214
<i>(THINKING) Stay on channel. Give
me a heads up if you spot him.</i>

256
00:13:01,682 --> 00:13:04,772
Whoa, dude, you
should see your face.

257
00:13:04,774 --> 00:13:06,150
What are you doing here?

258
00:13:06,181 --> 00:13:07,675
Same as you.
Tracking a breakout.

259
00:13:07,677 --> 00:13:10,144
Why didn't you tell me your
partner was hella fit?

260
00:13:10,146 --> 00:13:12,468
- Damn, girl.
- I have a deal with my uncle.

261
00:13:12,481 --> 00:13:14,608
I stay in line, he
keeps my family safe.

262
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:17,166
- I'm bringing that guy in.
- You have a family to protect,

263
00:13:17,210 --> 00:13:18,385
I have a species.

264
00:13:18,715 --> 00:13:20,755

all clear. I'm coming back.</i>

wait. I'm coming to you.</i>

HITMAN: Call me if you ever have
another problem, I can solve it.

267
00:13:31,467 --> 00:13:32,800
That's him.

Where is he?

276
00:14:26,388 --> 00:14:28,388
- I'll take that.
- No, not this time.

277
00:14:29,133 --> 00:14:30,257
Later, Stevie.

Shoulda been a hit man. (CHUCKLES)

Caviar palooza!

281
00:14:46,916 --> 00:14:48,554
This briefcase is bait.

282
00:14:52,625 --> 00:14:53,639
Hey.

283
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:54,839
What up, Mom?

284
00:14:54,871 --> 00:14:56,529
Are we purging the
basement again?

They're worth serious coin.

287
00:15:04,304 --> 00:15:06,105
Wouldn't dream of it, baby.

288
00:15:06,807 --> 00:15:08,160
I'll throw together dinner.

289
00:15:08,166 --> 00:15:09,642
Oh, already thrown.

290
00:15:10,077 --> 00:15:11,444
John hooked us up.

291
00:15:12,112 --> 00:15:13,112
John.

292
00:15:13,328 --> 00:15:14,947
- Mmm.
- I thought...

293
00:15:15,287 --> 00:15:17,750
Stephen was going to talk
to him about leaving.

294
00:15:21,354 --> 00:15:23,222
(CHUCKLING) What's this?

295
00:15:23,523 --> 00:15:24,890
Dig in.

296
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:27,268
Luca already ate
about half a cow.

297
00:15:27,915 --> 00:15:29,679
I'm guessing you guys
don't get a lot of

298
00:15:29,685 --> 00:15:31,311
proper family dinners.

299
00:15:31,431 --> 00:15:33,065
I try.

300
00:15:33,458 --> 00:15:37,023
But lately I've been lucky to get a
glimpse of my family these days.

301
00:15:37,511 --> 00:15:40,633
It seems like Stephen just comes
home to change his clothes.

302
00:15:40,974 --> 00:15:42,875
Well this looks great.

303
00:15:43,343 --> 00:15:44,910
You know, I...

304
00:15:45,876 --> 00:15:47,872
I can't even begin to imagine

305
00:15:47,928 --> 00:15:49,486
how hard it's been for you.

306
00:15:49,517 --> 00:15:51,817
And Luca. I can tell you this,

307
00:15:52,183 --> 00:15:55,654
when Stephen's gone, he is out
there protecting paranormals.

308
00:15:55,656 --> 00:15:57,025
What do you mean?

309
00:15:57,276 --> 00:15:59,046
I thought he was just an intern.

310
00:15:59,492 --> 00:16:02,294
Don't Ultra study the
Tomorrow People?

311
00:16:03,530 --> 00:16:05,497
Ultra hunts the Tomorrow People.

00:16:08,168 --> 00:16:09,401
What?

313
00:16:11,638 --> 00:16:13,972
Stephen has been acting
as a double agent

314
00:16:15,375 --> 00:16:18,065
to help us stay one step
ahead of Jedikiah and his

315
00:16:18,185 --> 00:16:19,592
lunatic partner.

316
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:23,571
That we're even surviving is

317
00:16:23,691 --> 00:16:25,272
pretty much thanks to him.

318
00:16:27,053 --> 00:16:28,387
He's a hero.

319
00:16:29,722 --> 00:16:30,922
(SIGHS)

320
00:16:31,424 --> 00:16:33,091
Just like his father.

321
00:16:36,562 --> 00:16:37,763
Ahem.

322
00:16:39,429 --> 00:16:41,319
Your husband was, umm...

323
00:16:42,733 --> 00:16:44,469
very important to me.

324
00:16:44,904 --> 00:16:46,238
You knew Roger?

325
00:16:51,844 --> 00:16:54,379
So I know how much
Stephen takes after him.

326
00:16:55,348 --> 00:16:57,482
Carrying the world
on his shoulders.

327
00:16:58,384 --> 00:17:00,151
Doing the right thing.

328
00:17:00,515 --> 00:17:01,848
No matter what the cost.

329
00:17:01,898 --> 00:17:04,476
I pay the cost, every day.
Right here.

330
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:06,024
So does Stephen.

331
00:17:06,284 --> 00:17:08,026
Family is everything to him.

332
00:17:08,462 --> 00:17:10,933
Which is why you got to
understand that if you leave,

333
00:17:10,971 --> 00:17:12,497
if you force Stephen,

334
00:17:13,432 --> 00:17:15,767
he would be leaving
his other family.

335
00:17:17,828 --> 00:17:19,748
And we need him just
as much as you do.

336
00:17:32,918 --> 00:17:34,285
Hi.

My God.

339
00:17:40,259 --> 00:17:41,926
They've gotten so big.

340
00:17:43,929 --> 00:17:45,663
It's been four years.

341
00:17:48,834 --> 00:17:50,059
I keep trying to

342
00:17:50,109 --> 00:17:52,236
lose track of the time,
I figured it would...

343
00:17:52,604 --> 00:17:53,738
you know...

344
00:17:54,406 --> 00:17:55,973
make missing you hurt less.

345
00:17:56,093 --> 00:17:58,142
Am I supposed to
feel sorry for you?

346
00:17:58,610 --> 00:17:59,944
No.

347
00:18:03,615 --> 00:18:05,182
You were right.

348
00:18:07,252 --> 00:18:09,720
I brought nothing but
danger to your doorstep.

349
00:18:14,459 --> 00:18:17,061
I know we've said our
share of goodbyes, but...

350
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:19,864
this is it.

351
00:18:20,665 --> 00:18:22,133

(LAUGHS)

354
00:18:44,557 --> 00:18:46,090
A woman?

355
00:18:46,558 --> 00:18:48,358
(GRUNTS) (GROANING)

356
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:50,094
I ask the questions.

357
00:18:50,214 --> 00:18:51,428
Who are you?

358
00:18:53,892 --> 00:18:56,676
See? That was a question.

359
00:18:56,748 --> 00:18:58,268
Are you getting the
hang of this, yet?

360
00:18:58,270 --> 00:18:59,811
The hit man you hired.

361
00:18:59,842 --> 00:19:01,100
The one you gave the money to,

362
00:19:01,112 --> 00:19:02,432
how do I get ahold of him?

363
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:03,540
What hit man?

364
00:19:05,243 --> 00:19:09,079
Was that a question coming out of that
pretty little Russian mouth of yours?

365
00:19:11,716 --> 00:19:12,950
Uh...

366
00:19:13,584 --> 00:19:15,840
I have a number for you.

367
00:19:18,156 --> 00:19:19,389
Good boy.

368
00:19:23,061 --> 00:19:25,462
<i>(THINKING) If you can hear
this, we have the briefcase.</i>

369
00:19:25,464 --> 00:19:27,064
<i>We mean no harm.</i>

370
00:19:27,832 --> 00:19:30,500
Talk about a fishing expedition.

371
00:19:30,776 --> 00:19:33,703
This fish lost a million bucks,
he's out looking for it.

372
00:19:34,205 --> 00:19:35,872
Only a matter of time.

373
00:19:36,638 --> 00:19:38,975
<i>(THINKING) If you can hear
this, we have your briefcase.</i>

374
00:19:46,450 --> 00:19:47,751
Get up.

375
00:19:48,252 --> 00:19:49,586
What are you doing?

376
00:19:49,588 --> 00:19:51,288
Have you ever heard of pajamas?

377
00:19:51,689 --> 00:19:53,356
Oh, excuse me.

378
00:19:53,358 --> 00:19:55,025
Wasn't expecting company.

379
00:19:55,609 --> 00:19:58,907
An Ultra agent is always prepared
to dispatch at a moment's notice.

380
00:19:58,925 --> 00:19:59,933
Read your handbook.

381
00:20:00,231 --> 00:20:01,364
We gotta go.

382
00:20:01,366 --> 00:20:03,099
- Where?
- I found him.

383
00:20:03,281 --> 00:20:04,834
Our breakout assassin.

384
00:20:06,370 --> 00:20:07,370
How?

385
00:20:07,467 --> 00:20:10,482
The owner of the club is being
indicted on racketeering charges.

386
00:20:10,776 --> 00:20:13,076
He was the one who ordered
the hit on his main witness.

387
00:20:13,611 --> 00:20:14,981
The motel murder victim.

388
00:20:15,479 --> 00:20:16,679
I've got the hit man's number.

389
00:20:16,681 --> 00:20:17,961
So what are we gonna do with it?

390
00:20:18,001 --> 00:20:19,349
Not we. You.

391
00:20:19,469 --> 00:20:21,084
You're going to hire
him to kill a guy.

392
00:20:23,083 --> 00:20:25,079
It's under "H", for hit man.

393
00:20:25,961 --> 00:20:27,890
Let me grab my "P" for pants.

394
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:44,774
You the guy?

395
00:20:45,375 --> 00:20:46,843
I'm the guy.

396
00:20:46,845 --> 00:20:48,444
Have a seat.

397
00:20:50,847 --> 00:20:52,348
You seem

398
00:20:52,749 --> 00:20:54,050
young.

399
00:20:54,819 --> 00:20:56,984
Well you're not exactly what
I was expecting either.

400
00:20:57,688 --> 00:20:59,735
You know, you come highly
recommended from a friend,

401
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:01,457
but maybe he was wrong.

402
00:21:03,727 --> 00:21:05,494
Look, I gotta ask.

403
00:21:05,666 --> 00:21:07,863
Are you affiliated with a
law enforcement agency?

404
00:21:07,983 --> 00:21:11,333
Reminding you it would be entrapment
to lie about said affiliation.

405
00:21:11,535 --> 00:21:12,835
No.

406
00:21:12,837 --> 00:21:15,104
I'm just looking for a permanent
fix to a real problem,

407
00:21:15,106 --> 00:21:16,605
you know what I mean?

408
00:21:17,974 --> 00:21:19,608
You mean...

409
00:21:20,010 --> 00:21:21,310
Murder?

410
00:21:22,846 --> 00:21:23,928
The murder you had in mind

411
00:21:23,947 --> 00:21:25,387
is gonna cost you a
million dollars.

412
00:21:25,882 --> 00:21:27,519
Seems a little steep.

413
00:21:27,951 --> 00:21:30,165
Plenty of guys could
do it for less.

414
00:21:30,353 --> 00:21:31,720
But I'm the best.

415
00:21:32,011 --> 00:21:34,723
I can get in anywhere,
anytime, anyhow.

416
00:21:36,113 --> 00:21:37,593
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hands on the table.

417
00:21:37,595 --> 00:21:39,061
Bad idea.

No problem.

421
00:21:52,308 --> 00:21:54,009
Sorry.

422
00:21:56,946 --> 00:21:58,814
<i>(THINKING) Sorry, Cara. It's over.</i>

423
00:22:04,663 --> 00:22:07,748
<i>(THINKING) That's funny, I was just
about to tell you the same thing.</i>

00:22:07,868 --> 00:22:09,044
<i>(THINKING) What are you talking about?</i>

425
00:22:09,069 --> 00:22:10,670
<i>We just brought the
breakout into Ultra.</i>

426
00:22:14,234 --> 00:22:15,234
<i>(THINKING) Oh yeah?</i>

427
00:22:15,259 --> 00:22:17,535
Then why did he just
walk onto my subway car?

428
00:22:35,145 --> 00:22:37,945
<i>(THINKING) Hate to break it to you,
but you got the wrong guy, Stephen.</i>

429
00:22:37,970 --> 00:22:39,182
<i>(THINKING) Yeah nice try, Cara.</i>

<i>(THINKING) They're twins.</i>

433
00:23:00,564 --> 00:23:02,665
Didn't your mother teach
you not to steal?

434
00:23:02,717 --> 00:23:04,534
Didn't yours teach
you not to kill?

435
00:23:04,551 --> 00:23:06,302
I never killed a soul.

437
00:23:09,174 --> 00:23:10,406
Oops.

438
00:23:13,391 --> 00:23:15,077
How is he able to kill?

439
00:23:16,380 --> 00:23:18,047
He's human.

440
00:23:18,070 --> 00:23:19,575
That's impossible.

441
00:23:19,609 --> 00:23:21,737
Only a paranormal could
have pulled off those hits.

442
00:23:21,857 --> 00:23:23,132
We've felt him teleport.

443
00:23:23,169 --> 00:23:24,621
The large tele-signatures.

444
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:26,372
He has a partner
teleporting him.

445
00:23:26,379 --> 00:23:27,743
Where are you pulling
this out of?

446
00:23:27,745 --> 00:23:29,145

00:23:29,147 --> 00:23:30,880

00:23:34,451 --> 00:23:36,218

We need to capture him
as soon as possible.

My brother's not
going to like this.

452
00:23:51,037 --> 00:23:53,235
He'll come after you.

453
00:23:53,570 --> 00:23:55,805
And when he does,
it won't be pretty.

454
00:23:55,807 --> 00:23:57,206
So how does this work?

455
00:23:57,208 --> 00:23:58,888
You teleport him in.

456
00:23:58,944 --> 00:24:00,564
He does the dirty work.

457
00:24:02,345 --> 00:24:04,013

at the hotel.

471
00:25:07,444 --> 00:25:09,244
So you're the executioner?

472
00:25:09,299 --> 00:25:10,879
Your brother's the getaway ride.

473
00:25:11,089 --> 00:25:12,903
What can I say? We
make a good team.

474
00:25:13,197 --> 00:25:15,150
You're as powerless
as a mewling kitten.

475
00:25:15,825 --> 00:25:18,186
You wouldn't say that if I
had a wire around your neck.

476
00:25:18,188 --> 00:25:19,754
Really?

477
00:25:20,253 --> 00:25:21,920
Textbook overcompensation.

478
00:25:23,422 --> 00:25:24,956
The fact of the matter is,

479
00:25:24,958 --> 00:25:28,126
your brother was born with gifts
that would make the gods jealous.

480
00:25:28,928 --> 00:25:32,868
But by some horrible
twist of fate,

481
00:25:32,887 --> 00:25:34,466
you were born with nothing.

482
00:25:34,870 --> 00:25:35,940
You're wrong.

483
00:25:36,009 --> 00:25:37,847
Who do you think
sets up the hits?

484
00:25:37,848 --> 00:25:39,571
Manages the money?

485
00:25:39,573 --> 00:25:41,020
Huh? My brother needs me.

486
00:25:41,064 --> 00:25:42,907
Because you're
shrewder than he is.

487
00:25:44,043 --> 00:25:45,510
Nature's

488
00:25:46,038 --> 00:25:48,272
pathetic attempt at
balancing the scales,

489
00:25:48,297 --> 00:25:49,714
but let me tell you
something, kid.

490
00:25:49,834 --> 00:25:52,250
One day your brother's going to
realize he doesn't need you.

491
00:25:53,085 --> 00:25:54,160
You're weak.

492
00:25:54,366 --> 00:25:55,543
You're a burden to him.

493
00:25:55,568 --> 00:25:57,444
An albatross around his neck.

494
00:25:57,756 --> 00:25:59,224
He doesn't need you.

495
00:26:00,626 --> 00:26:02,393
But what if I could help you?

496
00:26:03,883 --> 00:26:06,864
What if I could help you get the
powers that are your birthright?

497
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:10,234
Make you your brother's equal.

498
00:26:11,537 --> 00:26:12,737
How?

499
00:26:13,056 --> 00:26:16,253
Mmm. Well I would
need a donor, first.

00:26:18,310 --> 00:26:19,944
Your twin.

501
00:26:34,364 --> 00:26:35,798
The answer's no, Stephen.

502
00:26:35,833 --> 00:26:38,834
Cyrus may not be able to kill,
but he's an accessory to murder.

503

Let me take him in.

Tomorrow People. All of them.

What about the other criminal
breakouts we've given to Ultra?

506
00:26:45,909 --> 00:26:48,153
Cyrus was being manipulated
by his brother.

507
00:26:48,154 --> 00:26:50,994
If you want to punish someone, it
should be the brother that you've got.

508
00:26:51,114 --> 00:26:52,381
But no. You and Jedikiah
are too busy scheming

509
00:26:52,383 --> 00:26:54,249
to make Nathan sell
out his own twin.

Since you've become your

512
00:27:00,004 --> 00:27:01,004
I am.

513
00:27:01,678 --> 00:27:03,158
You're supposed to
be our inside man.

514
00:27:03,183 --> 00:27:05,385
And you're supposed to
help me protect my cover.

515
00:27:05,775 --> 00:27:07,376
I don't want to argue
with you, Stephen.

516
00:27:08,177 --> 00:27:10,545
I'm sorry, I just
don't have it in me.

Oh, this is ridiculous.
Cara is so...

Stubborn? Fearless?

522
00:27:26,311 --> 00:27:28,529
- Beautiful?
- In over her head.

523
00:27:28,531 --> 00:27:30,732
First kicking out, then
refusing to let go of Cyrus,

524
00:27:30,734 --> 00:27:33,687
she's just making one
mistake after another.

525
00:27:33,705 --> 00:27:35,036
She does have a point.

526
00:27:35,663 --> 00:27:37,359
Really? You're going
to defend her?

527
00:27:37,390 --> 00:27:39,786
Jedikiah is going to use
these twins as Guinea pigs.

528
00:27:39,849 --> 00:27:41,188
I thought that was just a ploy.

529
00:27:41,308 --> 00:27:43,344
No. It's real. Trust me.

Holy Grail for Jedikiah.

531
00:27:49,351 --> 00:27:51,118
Well, has he ever succeeded?

532
00:27:51,353 --> 00:27:52,420
No.

533
00:27:52,921 --> 00:27:54,655
I saw one once myself.

534
00:27:58,026 --> 00:28:00,151
The human is forced to watch

535
00:28:00,689 --> 00:28:04,450
as the paranormal is strapped
into this medieval looking chair

536
00:28:05,007 --> 00:28:07,201
that harvests their stem cells.

537
00:28:08,437 --> 00:28:09,970
Every time,

538
00:28:10,439 --> 00:28:12,039
the paranormal dies.

539
00:28:12,340 --> 00:28:13,340
In pain.

540
00:28:15,544 --> 00:28:17,260
Imagine if that
was you and Luca.

541
00:28:17,276 --> 00:28:18,990
Okay. I get it.

542
00:28:20,035 --> 00:28:22,816
So, like I said, maybe Cara's
right to want to hold on to him.

543
00:28:26,254 --> 00:28:29,101
Look, uh, obviously murder is...

544
00:28:29,445 --> 00:28:30,677
wrong, but...

545
00:28:31,114 --> 00:28:33,705
How do you and your brother
spend all the money?

546
00:28:34,462 --> 00:28:37,714
Are we talkin', uh, models
and bottles in Dubai?

547
00:28:37,834 --> 00:28:39,422
Savile row tailors?

548
00:28:39,635 --> 00:28:41,335
Holidays on the Riviera?

549
00:28:41,837 --> 00:28:43,303
Paint me a picture.

550
00:28:43,989 --> 00:28:45,906
Uh, we bought a house.

551
00:28:46,026 --> 00:28:47,508
Uh, in Connecticut.

552
00:28:48,743 --> 00:28:50,344
Buzzkill.

553
00:28:50,371 --> 00:28:53,086
Uh, it's big, it's got
two washer-dryers...

554
00:28:53,581 --> 00:28:56,183
<i>(PULSATING) Nathan: Cy?
Where are you? I need you.</i>

555
00:28:56,918 --> 00:28:59,537
<i>Cy, they're hurting me.</i>

556
00:28:59,587 --> 00:29:00,457
Dude, are you okay?

557
00:29:00,577 --> 00:29:01,758
Nathan's in trouble.

558
00:29:01,783 --> 00:29:03,584
I can feel it.
They're hurting him.

559
00:29:03,634 --> 00:29:04,634
<i>(THINKING) Cara?</i>

560
00:29:06,888 --> 00:29:10,329
Please. Take off the cuffs.
I have to help my brother.

561
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:11,798
Cyrus, listen to me.
It is a trap.

562
00:29:11,855 --> 00:29:13,615
Your brother's been
captured, and he's trying

563
00:29:13,628 --> 00:29:15,216
to manipulate you into
turning yourself in.

564
00:29:15,228 --> 00:29:17,480
(STAMMERING) No, I can
feel him. He needs me.

565
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:19,357
Your brother has been
using you for years.

566
00:29:19,370 --> 00:29:20,393
This is finally your
chance to be free of him.

567
00:29:20,406 --> 00:29:21,440
No...

568
00:29:21,472 --> 00:29:24,306
(STAMMERING) No, I have to
get to my brother. Please.

569
00:29:24,426 --> 00:29:27,190
- No, I will not let you...
- He's my family.

570
00:29:27,522 --> 00:29:31,195
You must have someone in your life
you'd sacrifice everything for.

571
00:29:33,054 --> 00:29:35,418
I thought your offer to give
Nathan powers was a trick.

572
00:29:35,538 --> 00:29:38,021
But it's real, only the procedure
will kill his brother.

573
00:29:38,033 --> 00:29:39,033
Hmm.

574
00:29:39,466 --> 00:29:41,806
I wonder where you got that
little piece of information?

575
00:29:42,519 --> 00:29:45,565
Not many of our agents know about
our transference protocol.

576
00:29:47,850 --> 00:29:51,178
Well, you're right. In the past
the donor has typically...

577
00:29:51,491 --> 00:29:52,667
expired.

578
00:29:52,787 --> 00:29:54,294
But that's science, Stephen.

579
00:29:54,301 --> 00:29:56,741
It's success built upon
decades of failure.

580
00:29:56,861 --> 00:29:59,919
And besides, we've never tried
the experiment on twins before.

581
00:29:59,951 --> 00:30:01,247
And you never will.

582
00:30:01,249 --> 00:30:04,551
Cyrus isn't gonna fall for your little trap.
The guy's sitting on a million bucks.

583
00:30:04,725 --> 00:30:06,519
He's probably out of
the country by now.

584
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:10,274
<i>CARA: (THINKING) I hope you're happy,
Stephen. Cyrus is turning himself in.</i>

585
00:30:12,401 --> 00:30:15,092
You okay? You're looking
a little dyspeptic.

586
00:30:16,340 --> 00:30:18,849
I'm unarmed. I don't
want any trouble.

587
00:30:19,366 --> 00:30:20,466
Well, well, well.

588
00:30:20,468 --> 00:30:22,735
It looks like my
little trap paid off.

589
00:30:24,271 --> 00:30:27,173
Take him to the lab. Prep
them both for the procedure.

590
00:30:36,683 --> 00:30:39,277
- Nathan, don't do this.
- What are you doing?

591
00:30:39,278 --> 00:30:42,136
If you try and take away his
powers, Cyrus will die.

592
00:30:42,256 --> 00:30:43,923
I've seen my share of death.

593
00:30:45,341 --> 00:30:46,580
He's your brother.

594
00:30:46,980 --> 00:30:51,003
What are you doing? Even if this
procedure works, which it never has,

595
00:30:51,123 --> 00:30:52,217
he dies.

596
00:30:53,112 --> 00:30:55,101
Are powers really worth
that much to you?

597
00:30:55,635 --> 00:30:58,437
So easy for you to say.

598
00:30:59,055 --> 00:31:01,607
You don't know what it's like
to be born without them.

599
00:31:03,243 --> 00:31:04,844
Step aside.

600

00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:22,828

602
00:31:23,730 --> 00:31:25,331

603
00:31:25,632 --> 00:31:27,334

You're gonna do well.

606
00:31:37,884 --> 00:31:39,511
May I say goodbye first?

607
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:42,047
Indeed.

608
00:31:45,285 --> 00:31:46,785
You ready, brother?

609
00:31:48,832 --> 00:31:50,570
If you think it's for the best.

610
00:31:51,210 --> 00:31:52,354
I do.

you don't wanna do this.

620
00:32:32,011 --> 00:32:34,289

million reasons why I do.

- No.

You thought you could convince

for the chance to study them.

00:34:31,511 --> 00:34:33,612
Perhaps a poor choice of words.

647
00:34:34,093 --> 00:34:36,564
Or maybe a scientist who himself

fueled my interest

00:34:45,662 --> 00:34:47,693

more than that.

of transferring powers
between siblings.

00:35:03,454 --> 00:35:05,387
You're telling me

662
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:09,414

to gain his powers?

663
00:35:09,824 --> 00:35:12,408
I value my humanity, Stephen.

664
00:35:12,908 --> 00:35:16,221
And he was my brother.
Not a lab rat.

Would you listen to yourself?

680
00:36:45,411 --> 00:36:47,578
You still care for Jedikiah.

681
00:36:48,514 --> 00:36:50,281
Or else you'd see I'm right.

682
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:57,788
Cyrus asked me something.

683
00:36:59,827 --> 00:37:02,523
If there was anyone in my

684
00:37:02,774 --> 00:37:04,144
everything for.

685
00:37:06,398 --> 00:37:07,732
It's you.

00:37:30,355 --> 00:37:31,822
No thanks.

00:37:32,958 --> 00:37:35,793
No, John, that's not what I...

You tell me.

00:38:14,532 --> 00:38:16,400
Yeah, everything's fine.

699
00:38:16,968 --> 00:38:18,368
For now.

00:38:33,936 --> 00:38:35,452
Mom.

706
00:38:36,453 --> 00:38:40,490
(SIGHING) I always resented your father for
choosing the fight over our family, but...

707
00:38:41,592 --> 00:38:43,326
Maybe I was wrong.

708
00:38:47,832 --> 00:38:51,419
Mom, everything that I'm
doing is for this family.

709
00:38:51,607 --> 00:38:52,607
I know.

710
00:38:53,202 --> 00:38:54,525
And I'm proud of you.

711
00:38:54,528 --> 00:38:56,749
You're a born leader,
just like your

712
00:38:57,341 --> 00:38:59,075
pain-in-the-ass father.

713
00:39:02,002 --> 00:39:03,513
So we can stay.

714
00:39:04,315 --> 00:39:06,649
And you can keep
working at Ultra.

715
00:39:06,989 --> 00:39:08,785
Because I know it's important.

716
00:39:10,054 --> 00:39:12,355
But I can't stop being your mom.

717
00:39:13,657 --> 00:39:15,817
I need to provide some

718
00:39:15,992 --> 00:39:18,751
semblance of a normal
life for you and Luca.

719
00:39:19,864 --> 00:39:21,164
I know.

720
00:39:21,532 --> 00:39:23,011
Luca needs it.

721
00:39:25,636 --> 00:39:26,970
So do I.

722
00:39:28,205 --> 00:39:31,574
But the days of burying my
head in the sand are over.

723
00:39:32,142 --> 00:39:33,810
I know you're in danger.

724
00:39:33,812 --> 00:39:35,044
At Ultra.

725
00:39:35,772 --> 00:39:38,031
So every night,
when you come home,

726
00:39:38,306 --> 00:39:39,758
I'll be waiting.

727
00:39:40,196 --> 00:39:43,252
Because I won't be able to rest
until I know that you're safe.

728
00:39:46,123 --> 00:39:47,523
I'm safe.

729
00:39:48,892 --> 00:39:50,226
For now.

730
00:39:54,298 --> 00:39:56,632
That's gonna have
to be good enough.

731
00:39:58,201 --> 00:39:59,735
Good night, Mom.

732
00:40:25,996 --> 00:40:27,730
I was so close.

733
00:40:29,132 --> 00:40:30,699
So close.

734
00:40:31,782 --> 00:40:35,348
I had the perfect two candidates,
and somehow, I just let 'em

735
00:40:35,373 --> 00:40:37,239
slip through my fingers.

736
00:40:40,310 --> 00:40:42,244
Well, you know what that means.

737
00:40:43,413 --> 00:40:46,482
You and I are going to have
to put our plans on hold.

738
00:40:47,083 --> 00:40:48,317
Again.

739
00:40:52,088 --> 00:40:53,589
I'm so sorry.

740
00:41:05,034 --> 00:41:07,636
Oh, yeah, you know, I
forgot to tell you.

741
00:41:07,971 --> 00:41:09,237
Your son.

742
00:41:09,639 --> 00:41:11,139
Sharp kid.

743
00:41:11,774 --> 00:41:13,508
He's looking for you.

744
00:41:14,243 --> 00:41:16,211
He's getting closer every day.

745
00:41:17,175 --> 00:41:19,881
You'd tell me if he tried to contact
you in any way, wouldn't you?

746
00:41:22,218 --> 00:41:25,587
You know what happens when we
keep secrets from each other.

747
00:41:28,124 --> 00:41:29,324
Okay.

748
00:41:30,893 --> 00:41:32,460
Anyway.

749
00:41:34,030 --> 00:41:35,864
Good night, little brother.

750
