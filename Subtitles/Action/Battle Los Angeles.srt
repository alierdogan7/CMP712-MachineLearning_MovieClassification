1
00:00:08,176 --> 00:00:12,135
--an unprecedented meteor shower
falling off the coast of Tokyo.

2
00:00:12,337 --> 00:00:16,097
The entire city is mesmerised
by this incredible sight.

3
00:00:16,778 --> 00:00:18,456
Two hours after the first contact...

4
00:00:18,617 --> 00:00:21,537
...an unidentified enemy
has reached our coastlines...

5
00:00:21,737 --> 00:00:24,738
...in a swift and militaristic attack.

6
00:00:28,058 --> 00:00:31,298
Right now, one thing is clear:
The world is at war.

7
00:00:45,581 --> 00:00:47,460
At 14:46 Pacific Standard Time...

8
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:50,261
...12 different locations
across the globe were breached...

9
00:00:50,421 --> 00:00:53,781
...in a coordinated attack
by an unknown enemy.

10
00:00:54,541 --> 00:00:57,461
All breaches were
along the coastline...

11
00:00:57,662 --> 00:01:00,061
...in what is a campaign
of rapid dominance.

12
00:01:00,263 --> 00:01:02,862
This is a textbook military invasion.

13
00:01:03,383 --> 00:01:05,782
There are massive casualties
in New York.

14
00:01:06,103 --> 00:01:09,062
Defensive lines
are being set up in Boston.

15
00:01:09,263 --> 00:01:12,782
And at 13:15 Zulu time,
we lost communications...

16
00:01:12,984 --> 00:01:15,143
...with San Francisco and San Diego.

17
00:01:15,344 --> 00:01:16,503
Their status is unknown.

18
00:01:18,064 --> 00:01:22,584
What we know is that we are the last
offensive force on the West Coast.

19
00:01:23,265 --> 00:01:25,584
We cannot lose Los Angeles.

20
00:01:29,545 --> 00:01:32,865
We have five birds down
two klicks west of CP Victory.

21
00:01:33,626 --> 00:01:36,225
We're hit, we're hit! Tighten
your asses, we're going down!

22
00:01:36,426 --> 00:01:38,025
Command and control is down.

23
00:01:38,186 --> 00:01:40,386
Civilians in need of support
two klicks northeast.

24
00:01:40,587 --> 00:01:42,826
Cables inbound.
Engage your sectors of fire, over.

25
00:01:43,307 --> 00:01:45,907
Oh, shit. Shit, shit, shit.

26
00:02:14,591 --> 00:02:17,670
Good morning. 94.5 with the Surfrider
Foundation Morning Surf Report.

27
00:02:19,431 --> 00:02:21,871
Surfers, hard northeast conditions
blowing out there...

28
00:02:22,071 --> 00:02:26,391
...the ocean slopping and chopping.
There is some size starting to build....

29
00:02:26,592 --> 00:02:28,671
Come on. Come on.

30
00:02:47,594 --> 00:02:49,554
-Morning, staff sergeant.
-Morning, sergeant.

31
00:02:49,754 --> 00:02:51,233
Morning, staff sergeant.

32
00:02:51,435 --> 00:02:53,554
-Morning, sergeant.
-Morning, staff sergeant.

33
00:02:53,755 --> 00:02:55,514
Morning, staff sergeant.

34
00:03:01,876 --> 00:03:03,955
Morning, you little prick.

35
00:03:18,277 --> 00:03:22,358
You know what they say. You're only
as old as you feel, staff sergeant.

36
00:03:22,558 --> 00:03:26,158
That's what I'm worried about.
I can't feel a damn thing.

37
00:03:31,119 --> 00:03:34,998
--to the Pacific for our next report,
where a cluster of meteors...

38
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:40,479
...is predicted to enter our atmosphere
in the early hours tomorrow morning.

39
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:41,680
Go ahead.

40
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:45,720
They're expected to strike miles
from land, far into the Pacific Ocean.

41
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:49,040
-John.
-Oh, God.

42
00:03:50,121 --> 00:03:51,681
What's up, Mike?

43
00:03:52,041 --> 00:03:55,681
Hey. What happened to that picture
of us in Iraq with that camel?

44
00:03:55,882 --> 00:03:57,521
I mean, your girlfriend.

45
00:03:58,122 --> 00:03:59,601
Hey, is this for real?

46
00:03:59,803 --> 00:04:03,521
It's got your signature. l said, "That's
gotta be a mistake. He can't write."

47
00:04:03,723 --> 00:04:07,483
No mistake, John. l did my 20.
I know when to get out.

48
00:04:07,683 --> 00:04:10,922
Come on. You got the box full of
medals, a file full of commendations.

49
00:04:11,124 --> 00:04:13,643
You can have them.
Seems you like interior decorating.

50
00:04:13,844 --> 00:04:17,443
A Marine's got a shelf life, you know?
After that....

51
00:04:17,644 --> 00:04:18,883
What? He spoils?

52
00:04:19,085 --> 00:04:20,604
Something like that.

53
00:04:20,804 --> 00:04:23,324
I'll finish my training assignment
with these Marines.

54
00:04:23,485 --> 00:04:25,045
Get them combat ready.

55
00:04:25,805 --> 00:04:27,605
And then I'll be on my merry way.

56
00:04:28,485 --> 00:04:31,766
You know, we could always use
another lean, mean typing machine.

57
00:04:31,966 --> 00:04:33,686
Shit, I ain't built like you, John.

58
00:04:34,166 --> 00:04:35,925
Ugly, slow, soft.

59
00:04:38,687 --> 00:04:40,206
God.

60
00:04:41,407 --> 00:04:43,366
You had to make some
tough calls there, Mike.

61
00:04:45,407 --> 00:04:47,567
Especially that last one.

62
00:04:48,608 --> 00:04:51,447
We all wish your men made it home.

63
00:04:53,648 --> 00:04:55,208
Here we go.

64
00:05:03,450 --> 00:05:05,049
You're expired.

65
00:05:05,450 --> 00:05:06,649
Clear the shelf...

66
00:05:07,610 --> 00:05:09,129
...staff sergeant.

67
00:05:21,011 --> 00:05:22,731
Everything I know is in here, John.

68
00:05:40,773 --> 00:05:44,053
What typically would have been
detected months, if not years, before...

69
00:05:44,214 --> 00:05:46,293
...surfaced in less than four hours.

70
00:05:46,495 --> 00:05:50,214
These images giving some idea of
the rate these meteors are travelling.

71
00:05:51,535 --> 00:05:54,094
Scientists are abuzz,
scrambling to try and understand it.

72
00:05:54,255 --> 00:05:56,495
There's something just
extremely uncomfortable...

73
00:05:56,695 --> 00:05:58,895
...about a man your size
sniffing a flower.

74
00:05:59,096 --> 00:06:00,935
What you want is some hydrangeas.

75
00:06:01,136 --> 00:06:03,695
Popular wedding flower,
come in green, blue.

76
00:06:03,856 --> 00:06:06,176
What colour is
the bridesmaids' dresses?

77
00:06:07,577 --> 00:06:11,177
-Good question.
-You're amazing. Take a whiff. Smell it.

78
00:06:12,457 --> 00:06:13,777
Yes, pretty girl?

79
00:06:13,977 --> 00:06:17,497
For 300 more, she said we could have
sprays of lilies.

80
00:06:17,698 --> 00:06:20,817
Now, l know it's a lot, but it'd be
so beautiful. What do you think?

81
00:06:21,018 --> 00:06:22,538
300 dollars? Goodness gracious.

82
00:06:22,738 --> 00:06:26,498
It's a no-brainer. You're only getting
married once. Worry about 300 bucks?

83
00:06:26,699 --> 00:06:29,538
-Thank you, Stavrou. Thank you.
-Yeah, no worries.

84
00:06:30,739 --> 00:06:34,739
You know what? lt's your day.
Do whatever you want.

85
00:06:36,581 --> 00:06:38,900
I'm gonna hit you with something.
What are you doing?

86
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:40,100
Busting your balls.

87
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:41,740
Tomorrow we shop for cakes.

88
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:43,700
And l can't wait.

89
00:06:43,901 --> 00:06:45,020
I love cake.

90
00:06:57,462 --> 00:06:58,701
Yo, Doc. What you doing?

91
00:06:58,903 --> 00:06:59,901
Skyping back home.

92
00:07:00,062 --> 00:07:02,862
Is that your girlfriend? Damn, she fine.

93
00:07:04,183 --> 00:07:05,742
Doc. My boy.

94
00:07:09,864 --> 00:07:11,983
That's my sister.

95
00:07:14,425 --> 00:07:15,624
Goddamn.

96
00:07:15,824 --> 00:07:19,664
Shoot, man. I'm speaking objectively
here, you know what I'm saying?

97
00:07:20,305 --> 00:07:21,705
All right, no, stop playing!

98
00:07:23,425 --> 00:07:24,665
May I take a message?

99
00:07:24,865 --> 00:07:27,064
Doc, is it all right
if l have one of those first?

100
00:07:28,986 --> 00:07:31,345
You eat it at your own risk.

101
00:07:33,106 --> 00:07:34,586
They're very old.

102
00:07:36,627 --> 00:07:38,546
So do you feel
that you're making progress?

103
00:07:39,867 --> 00:07:42,267
Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

104
00:07:43,547 --> 00:07:44,987
I'm sleeping a lot better.

105
00:07:45,187 --> 00:07:47,707
And then also around the firing range
and everything...

106
00:07:47,868 --> 00:07:50,307
...when I first came back
and hear the pop, pop, pop...

107
00:07:50,469 --> 00:07:53,988
...I'd get jumpy and it would mess with
me a bit and a little bit of a setback.

108
00:07:54,189 --> 00:07:56,148
But now it, you know...

109
00:07:57,149 --> 00:07:58,788
...doesn't bother me.

110
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:00,668
So l think that's progress.

111
00:08:01,550 --> 00:08:04,109
So, what's the story
with my status, doc?

112
00:08:04,310 --> 00:08:07,070
I mean, are you gonna clear me
for combat? Because....

113
00:08:07,470 --> 00:08:09,069
Yeah, l feel good.

114
00:08:11,591 --> 00:08:13,830
Let's meet again next week...

115
00:08:15,271 --> 00:08:17,791
...and we'll discuss it. Okay?

116
00:08:19,312 --> 00:08:22,911
All right, thank you.
Thank you very much, doc.

117
00:08:30,393 --> 00:08:33,433
Harris' girl is making the dude
organise his entire wedding...

118
00:08:33,593 --> 00:08:34,992
...two weeks before we deploy.

119
00:08:36,353 --> 00:08:39,713
I say the chick's busting his balls
like nobody's business.

120
00:08:41,834 --> 00:08:44,234
But he got two weeks to get it done
because we're out.

121
00:08:44,434 --> 00:08:47,754
So l just came by to visit you
one last time before we leave.

122
00:08:47,955 --> 00:08:52,195
And l brought Dad's five iron with me.
And you know what that means.

123
00:08:53,316 --> 00:08:57,075
Me and the boys are gonna
go out tonight, continue the tradition.

124
00:08:57,796 --> 00:08:59,915
Have a good time, you know?

125
00:09:01,716 --> 00:09:03,436
I'll see you soon, bro.

126
00:09:07,837 --> 00:09:09,237
See you soon.

127
00:09:12,397 --> 00:09:14,357
Motown, give me boots.
I'm going skiing.

128
00:09:14,518 --> 00:09:16,037
Oh, that's how you do it, baby.

129
00:09:19,038 --> 00:09:20,077
Here they come.

130
00:09:20,278 --> 00:09:23,118
Don't mess this up, man.
They cannot know that you a virgin.

131
00:09:23,319 --> 00:09:25,798
How do you know l--
Who says I'm a virgin?

132
00:09:25,999 --> 00:09:27,558
We know you are. Look at your face.

133
00:09:27,759 --> 00:09:30,039
What are you telling her?
Telling her what?

134
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:33,759
Oh, come on, you guys.
You're killing me.

135
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:38,639
That dog gonna hunt! Damn, Daktari,
you can play, man.

136
00:09:39,241 --> 00:09:41,000
We have courses in Nigeria, Imlay.

137
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:45,001
Shit. How am l supposed to know,
man? It's an American game, right?

138
00:09:45,201 --> 00:09:47,441
Adukwu's our Navy corpsman.
He's like a medic.

139
00:09:47,642 --> 00:09:50,721
No, not like a medic. Medic is
the Army. I'm a Navy corpsman.

140
00:09:50,922 --> 00:09:52,761
Well, sailor, yes.

141
00:09:52,962 --> 00:09:54,401
I came here to become a doctor.

142
00:09:59,163 --> 00:10:00,562
Slow down.

143
00:10:01,723 --> 00:10:03,162
That's like number five.

144
00:10:03,363 --> 00:10:04,643
How many have you had?

145
00:10:04,843 --> 00:10:06,123
No, I'm good.

146
00:10:06,323 --> 00:10:09,444
-Now, this guy here, Mr. Lenihan...
-Hey.

147
00:10:09,644 --> 00:10:12,284
...his mom signed
so he could join up at 17.

148
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:16,004
And l look after him because this boy
don't know his ass from a hot rock.

149
00:10:21,125 --> 00:10:24,284
-Not on my truck, dude!
-Easy, now. Easy, buddy.

150
00:10:24,486 --> 00:10:26,525
-Oh, yeah!
-Not on my truck.

151
00:10:26,726 --> 00:10:29,645
-Toast. To Lenihan.
-To Lenihan!

152
00:10:29,847 --> 00:10:31,366
Good luck, rookie.

153
00:10:31,566 --> 00:10:32,726
Retreat, hell!

154
00:10:32,926 --> 00:10:36,006
--emergency developing throughout
NASA and the space community.

155
00:10:36,207 --> 00:10:40,127
We now know that meteors will land
off the coasts of eight different cities...

156
00:10:40,327 --> 00:10:42,127
...and that number could keep rising.

157
00:10:42,328 --> 00:10:45,087
Evacuations now under way
in Southern California...

158
00:10:45,288 --> 00:10:47,487
...moving the population back
from the coastline.

159
00:10:47,849 --> 00:10:50,688
But a lot of curious people
are clamouring for views.

160
00:10:50,888 --> 00:10:56,008
-What are you doing up so early?
-Lieutenant. Still gotta get used to that.

161
00:10:59,689 --> 00:11:01,169
This thing right?

162
00:11:01,370 --> 00:11:03,329
-Here. You want me to do it?
-lt's tricky.

163
00:11:04,691 --> 00:11:08,049
They gotta be parallel to the deck.
That's the whole thing with these bars.

164
00:11:08,251 --> 00:11:10,410
-Don't forget to call Mr. Gilliam, okay?
-Okay.

165
00:11:10,571 --> 00:11:12,251
-Call me later.
-I'll call you later.

166
00:11:16,212 --> 00:11:18,571
That's my baby. All right.

167
00:11:36,174 --> 00:11:38,213
Let's go! Move!

168
00:11:42,575 --> 00:11:45,574
Quick time! March!

169
00:11:49,095 --> 00:11:53,455
Marines! lnto the trucks and report
to your company! Let's go!

170
00:11:53,656 --> 00:11:54,935
Move it! Let's move!

171
00:11:55,136 --> 00:11:56,535
Move it!

172
00:11:56,736 --> 00:11:59,176
-Load them up!
-Move it!

173
00:11:59,376 --> 00:12:01,416
What's going on, first sergeant?

174
00:12:03,057 --> 00:12:05,056
Meteors hitting off California now...

175
00:12:05,777 --> 00:12:08,217
...but they got the whole
goddamn base being mobilised.

176
00:12:08,417 --> 00:12:12,657
I'm bringing you back to the company,
Mike. They need you.

177
00:12:13,138 --> 00:12:14,777
First sergeant.

178
00:12:16,258 --> 00:12:19,018
All hands on deck, staff sergeant.

179
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:25,499
-You heard we might be mobilising?
-Yes, sir.

180
00:12:25,699 --> 00:12:27,058
Moving you up to squad leader.

181
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:29,419
It's a big responsibility,
but you can handle it.

182
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:30,899
Thank you, sir.

183
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:34,499
Staff Sergeant Beck is being replaced
by Staff Sergeant Nantz.

184
00:12:35,781 --> 00:12:37,300
What do you know about him?

185
00:12:37,981 --> 00:12:40,461
He's a very dedicated Marine.

186
00:12:41,142 --> 00:12:42,901
Don't bullshit me, corporal.

187
00:12:43,621 --> 00:12:45,621
What'd you hear about his last tour?

188
00:12:46,422 --> 00:12:49,341
Just the grimy details
that everybody else already knows.

189
00:12:49,822 --> 00:12:52,181
But at the end of the day,
you're our lieutenant...

190
00:12:52,343 --> 00:12:54,582
...and we take our orders from you, sir.

191
00:12:57,943 --> 00:13:01,703
You're assigned to 1st Platoon
under Second Lieutenant Martinez.

192
00:13:02,744 --> 00:13:06,583
His platoon sergeant's on leave,
so you're gonna have to suck it up.

193
00:13:07,064 --> 00:13:10,263
Yeah, so, here's the lieutenant
right up here, 1 o'clock.

194
00:13:10,424 --> 00:13:11,784
He's a kid, Mike.

195
00:13:12,345 --> 00:13:14,104
Right out of officer training school.

196
00:13:14,305 --> 00:13:16,824
He's only been with us a month,
but I think he's sharp.

197
00:13:17,825 --> 00:13:21,025
It's just an evacuation, buddy.
He's in charge.

198
00:13:21,266 --> 00:13:23,665
Just keep an eye on him, huh?

199
00:13:26,947 --> 00:13:28,466
Just don't lose my paperwork.

200
00:13:29,306 --> 00:13:31,386
-Lieutenant.
-Good afternoon, staff sergeant.

201
00:13:31,587 --> 00:13:33,306
-Happy to meet you.
-Thank you, sir.

202
00:13:33,467 --> 00:13:37,306
We're being called in to help with
an evacuation? For these meteors?

203
00:13:37,468 --> 00:13:38,906
I assume so.

204
00:13:39,067 --> 00:13:41,707
Whatever it is, I'm happy to finally
get out in the field.

205
00:13:41,948 --> 00:13:44,187
At approximately 4:42 am
Pacific Standard Time...

206
00:13:44,349 --> 00:13:45,708
...the meteors impacted....

207
00:13:45,869 --> 00:13:48,548
Who the hell took my tortellini?
You got tortellini?

208
00:13:48,749 --> 00:13:49,828
This some kind of drill?

209
00:13:49,989 --> 00:13:53,308
Get ready, man. Get ready.
It's serious. Okay?

210
00:13:56,310 --> 00:14:00,589
Meteors continue to fall off the coast
of California, Ireland, Bay of Bengal....

211
00:14:00,790 --> 00:14:01,790
Corporal. Corporal.

212
00:14:01,990 --> 00:14:03,469
-Corporal. Corporal.
-Yeah?

213
00:14:03,671 --> 00:14:05,430
It's probably just a training exercise.

214
00:14:05,631 --> 00:14:08,670
No, man. They're shifting Nantz
into our unit. Something's going on.

215
00:14:08,831 --> 00:14:11,830
The guy wants out of the Marine
Corps and now we're stuck with him.

216
00:14:12,031 --> 00:14:13,711
-Stavs!
-You got tortellini?

217
00:14:14,752 --> 00:14:16,631
I heard Nantz kicked ass his last tour.

218
00:14:16,832 --> 00:14:19,391
He went into that compound alone
and killed 10 insurgents.

219
00:14:19,552 --> 00:14:22,192
-That's what you heard, Lenihan?
-Chill out.

220
00:14:22,353 --> 00:14:24,792
Yeah. Johnson in Foxtrot told me
that he was going on--

221
00:14:24,953 --> 00:14:26,192
Don't worry about it.

222
00:14:26,393 --> 00:14:28,992
-Let's go, this is serious.
-What the hell did l do?

223
00:14:29,153 --> 00:14:31,233
Nantz got a couple guys killed
on his last tour.

224
00:14:31,394 --> 00:14:32,433
What?

225
00:14:32,594 --> 00:14:34,713
That's the story.
Lockett's brother was one.

226
00:14:34,914 --> 00:14:39,033
So l know you didn't know, but
just don't-- No, don't worry about it.

227
00:14:39,434 --> 00:14:41,634
Looks like we're getting into
some heavy shit.

228
00:14:41,874 --> 00:14:45,395
It's been my experience, lieutenant,
heavy shit is highly overrated.

229
00:14:45,595 --> 00:14:48,835
Look, staff sergeant, let's just be clear.

230
00:14:49,076 --> 00:14:51,075
I know your rep,
know what you've done.

231
00:14:51,236 --> 00:14:53,595
This is my platoon.
These are my men.

232
00:14:53,796 --> 00:14:56,916
-Not gonna have a problem, are we?
-No problem, sir. She's all yours.

233
00:14:57,276 --> 00:15:00,196
It appears our initial assumptions
were wrong.

234
00:15:02,677 --> 00:15:04,516
Listen up!
Once you get your weapon...

235
00:15:04,757 --> 00:15:08,196
...get your gear, get your munitions,
move outside!

236
00:15:10,438 --> 00:15:13,477
We got white chocolate rap from my
man. That should finish the new mix?

237
00:15:13,639 --> 00:15:16,958
National Guard troops have flown in
to evacuate beach areas...

238
00:15:17,159 --> 00:15:20,838
...and we have word
the military is now deploying.

239
00:15:21,039 --> 00:15:23,878
That's us. That's us! That's us!

240
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:27,319
-Calling military for a meteor shower?
-l don't know why they're happy.

241
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:29,079
--a meteor that just hit the ocean.

242
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:34,080
Large plumes of smoke are coming
up. Visibility is getting worse as we....

243
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:36,400
These objects were
completely undetected...

244
00:15:36,561 --> 00:15:38,280
...until they entered our atmosphere.

245
00:15:38,482 --> 00:15:41,721
NASA estimates that they are not
hitting the water at terminal velocity.

246
00:15:41,922 --> 00:15:44,441
They're slowing down before impact.

247
00:15:46,362 --> 00:15:50,282
These objects are falling into
the ocean in tightly packed clusters...

248
00:15:50,482 --> 00:15:53,202
...10 miles outside
of a major population centre.

249
00:15:53,403 --> 00:15:55,322
Thermal imaging
from the Hubble shows us...

250
00:15:55,523 --> 00:15:59,163
...that within each cluster is a central
object much larger than the others.

251
00:15:59,363 --> 00:16:02,362
Now, these central objects
are all the same geometric shape.

252
00:16:02,564 --> 00:16:04,803
They appear mechanical in nature.

253
00:16:05,204 --> 00:16:07,483
This is not a meteor shower, Marines.

254
00:16:07,685 --> 00:16:10,524
We are in Threatcon Delta.
That's right.

255
00:16:10,725 --> 00:16:13,884
Come on. All units, gear up.

256
00:16:14,085 --> 00:16:15,564
Be ready to move.

257
00:16:16,365 --> 00:16:17,565
Combat situation.

258
00:16:17,765 --> 00:16:19,765
It's what I've been training for.

259
00:16:22,406 --> 00:16:25,646
l am told that one of the Coast Guard
cutters has issued a mayday.

260
00:16:25,846 --> 00:16:28,206
lt is difficult to see, and--
Oh, my gosh!

261
00:16:28,407 --> 00:16:31,806
There is just another meteor
that just hit the ocean...

262
00:16:32,007 --> 00:16:34,646
...and it's the closest one yet,
right behind those cutters.

263
00:16:34,848 --> 00:16:37,086
Two or three meteors just impacted.

264
00:16:38,088 --> 00:16:39,167
Shit.

265
00:16:39,328 --> 00:16:42,567
Do you have any more information
in the studio? Oh, my God.

266
00:16:43,568 --> 00:16:46,608
Kate? Kate? Are you hearing us?

267
00:16:47,889 --> 00:16:51,408
-Shut up, shut up, shut up!
-Kate, are you still hearing us?

268
00:16:51,889 --> 00:16:55,929
Yes, Jean, I can hear you. Everyone,
move out. Get out of the way.

269
00:16:56,450 --> 00:16:58,249
What is that?
What is that in the water?

270
00:16:58,451 --> 00:17:01,410
I can't really get a good look,
but it appears there's something--

271
00:17:01,571 --> 00:17:05,330
I'm looking through the people, trying
to determine exactly what this is.

272
00:17:05,531 --> 00:17:09,210
I don't even know.
It's like shadowy figures.

273
00:17:09,412 --> 00:17:13,091
Maybe five, six, seven.
I can make out maybe eight figures.

274
00:17:14,412 --> 00:17:16,412
-What the hell is that?
-Holy shit!

275
00:17:16,612 --> 00:17:19,331
-Look at that!
-Stavs, you see that?

276
00:17:19,492 --> 00:17:23,052
I'm gonna head back now. Everyone
needs to get out of here right now.

277
00:17:29,534 --> 00:17:32,653
I think that we've gotta leave, Jean.
I'm gonna head back now.

278
00:17:33,334 --> 00:17:34,813
Oh, my God!

279
00:17:37,974 --> 00:17:40,614
Go! Let's go. Go, go!

280
00:17:40,855 --> 00:17:43,695
Corporal Grayston and Corporal lmlay
are both expert marksmen...

281
00:17:43,856 --> 00:17:45,814
...as well as strong fire team leaders.

282
00:17:46,016 --> 00:17:48,775
We also have PFC Lenihan,
who is our second best marksman...

283
00:17:48,976 --> 00:17:52,975
-...behind Lance Corporal Guerrero.
-What's your take on this, Specs?

284
00:17:53,577 --> 00:17:55,535
I don't know. Extraterrestrial?

285
00:17:55,737 --> 00:17:57,736
-Do you mean like from space?
-No, Imlay.

286
00:17:57,937 --> 00:18:00,136
-From Canada.
-Always got jokes, don't you, Stav?

287
00:18:00,337 --> 00:18:02,897
All right, first squad, line it up.
Bring it in. Let's go!

288
00:18:04,698 --> 00:18:05,977
As you may have heard...

289
00:18:06,178 --> 00:18:09,297
...Staff Sergeant Nantz will be
taking over for Staff Sergeant Beck.

290
00:18:09,499 --> 00:18:11,418
We're lucky to have him aboard.

291
00:18:12,099 --> 00:18:15,578
All right. Here's the situation, Marines.
We're facing an unknown enemy.

292
00:18:16,339 --> 00:18:19,458
We don't know how strong their
force is or what they're capable of.

293
00:18:19,659 --> 00:18:23,098
But one thing we do know
is that we're fighting for our land...

294
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:26,619
...our families, our home
and our country, goddamn it!

295
00:18:26,781 --> 00:18:30,020
Whatever those things are, let's show
them how Marines fight. Retreat....

296
00:18:30,181 --> 00:18:31,179
-Hell!
-Two-Five!

297
00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:33,260
-Retreat, hell!
-Let's form it up, let's go!

298
00:18:44,462 --> 00:18:46,701
First in, last out, Marines!

299
00:18:47,422 --> 00:18:50,302
Breathe, Lenihan. Breathe.
Your training will kick in.

300
00:18:50,503 --> 00:18:52,342
Thank you, staff sergeant!

301
00:18:53,503 --> 00:18:56,783
-Got something to get off your chest?
-No, it's cool, staff sergeant.

302
00:18:56,983 --> 00:18:59,903
You got a silver star, my brother
came home in a box. I get it.

303
00:19:02,704 --> 00:19:05,623
All stations, this net.
Standby for sitrep.

304
00:19:05,825 --> 00:19:08,024
Enemy elements have advanced
beyond the beach.

305
00:19:08,224 --> 00:19:11,905
Aliens? That's not possible, right?

306
00:19:12,785 --> 00:19:14,585
We'll know soon enough, brother.

307
00:19:15,385 --> 00:19:19,145
One-oh-one tank has been destroyed.
Company beyond the defensive line....

308
00:19:19,346 --> 00:19:23,146
It's in case his head gets blown off,
so they can identify his body.

309
00:19:25,106 --> 00:19:27,346
Be advised, enemy have
heavy assault weapons.

310
00:19:27,547 --> 00:19:30,106
Firepower equal
to high-explosive rounds.

311
00:19:32,748 --> 00:19:36,627
Hey, staff sergeant! Promise me
you won't let me be taken alive...

312
00:19:36,828 --> 00:19:40,227
...by some godless predator
from another world, staff sergeant?

313
00:19:41,509 --> 00:19:43,828
No promises in combat.

314
00:19:44,589 --> 00:19:47,268
Stop screwing around
and keep your head in it!

315
00:19:48,110 --> 00:19:53,189
These units are falling tactically.
Their strategies are coordinated.

316
00:19:53,390 --> 00:19:56,350
Do not underestimate enemy
combat intelligence.

317
00:20:03,111 --> 00:20:05,111
We are not evacuating civilians
fast enough.

318
00:20:05,311 --> 00:20:07,591
I say again, we are not evacuating
fast enough.

319
00:20:07,791 --> 00:20:12,911
All units be advised, there are
friendlies behind enemy lines.

320
00:20:13,392 --> 00:20:15,831
Semper Fi, 1-7 Actual, out.

321
00:20:48,316 --> 00:20:50,155
You gotta take me to dinner first, baby.

322
00:20:50,356 --> 00:20:52,916
Boys, hold on to something.
Things are about to get rough.

323
00:21:34,321 --> 00:21:37,001
Let's go, let's go, let's go! Out! Go!

324
00:21:46,483 --> 00:21:48,162
Move, move, move!

325
00:21:50,043 --> 00:21:51,602
Form it up!

326
00:21:58,724 --> 00:22:01,603
-What do we got, sir?
-All right, situation is as follows:

327
00:22:01,804 --> 00:22:04,164
Most of Santa Monica's
been cleared of civilians.

328
00:22:04,364 --> 00:22:07,804
We got a defensive line at Lincoln
Boulevard a mile from the ocean.

329
00:22:08,005 --> 00:22:11,285
Air Force has got Warthogs
and B-52s on deck.

330
00:22:11,485 --> 00:22:16,605
At 1930 hours, they will pound the
entire area from Lincoln to the ocean.

331
00:22:17,406 --> 00:22:18,566
Shit.

332
00:22:20,806 --> 00:22:22,286
We're levelling Santa Monica, sir?

333
00:22:22,487 --> 00:22:24,646
We got an infestation
of God knows what...

334
00:22:24,847 --> 00:22:27,686
...not of this Earth and
we gotta hit them with everything...

335
00:22:27,888 --> 00:22:31,007
...and we gotta hit them hard.
They are a ground-force enemy only.

336
00:22:31,207 --> 00:22:34,367
They have no aircraft, so the Air Force
will tear them a new asshole...

337
00:22:34,568 --> 00:22:36,248
...and we will rule the air.

338
00:22:36,448 --> 00:22:38,408
-You said "most civilians," sir?
-Affirmed.

339
00:22:38,609 --> 00:22:40,807
Getting distress calls,
sending squads out.

340
00:22:41,009 --> 00:22:43,848
Golf, you take Santa Monica
to Olympic.

341
00:22:44,049 --> 00:22:46,129
Foxtrot, Olympic to Pico.

342
00:22:46,329 --> 00:22:48,409
Echo, Pico to Ocean Park.

343
00:22:48,610 --> 00:22:51,049
Lieutenant Martinez,
I want you to break off a squad...

344
00:22:51,210 --> 00:22:52,369
...and a machine gun team.

345
00:22:52,570 --> 00:22:56,329
Proceed west from Lincoln
to a police station located here...

346
00:22:56,531 --> 00:22:58,610
-...at Venice and Amarosa.
-Venice and Amarosa.

347
00:22:58,811 --> 00:23:00,130
Police were overrun.

348
00:23:00,331 --> 00:23:04,611
Got a distress call that civilians are
still there. We don't know how many.

349
00:23:04,811 --> 00:23:06,771
Just gather survivors,
then you radio in.

350
00:23:06,972 --> 00:23:09,731
We'll have helicopters
in the area to evacuate you out.

351
00:23:09,932 --> 00:23:13,611
Now, be advised, you got exactly
three hours before our bombs drop.

352
00:23:13,813 --> 00:23:16,772
And make no mistake, they will drop,
with or without you.

353
00:23:16,973 --> 00:23:19,212
Get those civilians,
get the hell out of there...

354
00:23:19,413 --> 00:23:22,572
...and you kill anything
that is not human.

355
00:23:22,774 --> 00:23:24,813
Let's go! Let's get it done!

356
00:23:25,133 --> 00:23:28,293
Captain, this is not a drill. You hold
that line, you understand me?

357
00:23:28,494 --> 00:23:29,494
Yes, sir.

358
00:23:38,855 --> 00:23:41,454
--from the coastline into suburbs.
Golf company is overrun.

359
00:23:41,656 --> 00:23:43,895
Lima company
requesting immediate air support.

360
00:23:44,096 --> 00:23:47,015
Civilians are being stranded
behind enemy lines.

361
00:23:47,216 --> 00:23:48,495
Hang on, One!

362
00:23:48,697 --> 00:23:50,095
Fire in the hole!

363
00:24:04,378 --> 00:24:07,497
Troops are amassing in every coast,
along every major coastline.

364
00:24:07,699 --> 00:24:09,538
The UN has called
an emergency sitting...

365
00:24:09,698 --> 00:24:12,458
...in an attempt to establish
a means for sharing resources...

366
00:24:12,659 --> 00:24:14,498
...and intelligence across the globe.

367
00:24:14,699 --> 00:24:16,259
Watch out, go!

368
00:24:18,260 --> 00:24:20,859
This way?
Where are we supposed to go?

369
00:24:22,021 --> 00:24:23,579
Jesus Christ.

370
00:24:35,061 --> 00:24:38,221
Marines, anything beyond this point,
consider to be hostile.

371
00:24:38,422 --> 00:24:39,982
All right, nice and easy.

372
00:24:49,584 --> 00:24:50,943
Clear.

373
00:24:53,824 --> 00:24:55,623
Hell of a way to earn your citizenship.

374
00:24:56,024 --> 00:24:58,063
Shit. I'd rather be in Afghanistan.

375
00:24:58,264 --> 00:25:01,983
Lieutenant. How many civilians
we gotta get out of that police station?

376
00:25:02,145 --> 00:25:05,064
I have no idea, Guerrero.
Just stay focused.

377
00:25:10,905 --> 00:25:13,505
-What the hell's that? What is that?
-This is insane.

378
00:25:13,706 --> 00:25:15,145
Yo, eyes open.

379
00:25:15,346 --> 00:25:18,066
An unidentified enemy
has breached our coastlines...

380
00:25:18,266 --> 00:25:20,786
...in a swift and militaristic attack.

381
00:25:20,987 --> 00:25:23,906
At this point, there are many more
questions than answers.

382
00:25:24,107 --> 00:25:28,267
Right now, one thing is clear:
The world is at war.

383
00:25:29,308 --> 00:25:30,746
Eyes open.

384
00:25:32,988 --> 00:25:34,948
You see something, Simmons?

385
00:25:36,028 --> 00:25:37,308
Can't see shit.

386
00:25:39,589 --> 00:25:43,108
-Kerns, you see a cross street?
-Lieutenant, I don't see nothing.

387
00:25:43,549 --> 00:25:46,589
Police station's
about one klick northwest of here.

388
00:26:18,194 --> 00:26:20,473
-Twelve o'clock!
-Hundred metres front.

389
00:26:20,673 --> 00:26:23,473
-This is Echo 6, we need immediate--
-Turn your radios down.

390
00:26:32,515 --> 00:26:35,714
-lt's just a dog.
-Just a little doggy. Come here.

391
00:26:35,915 --> 00:26:36,994
-lt's just a dog.
-Dog.

392
00:26:37,195 --> 00:26:38,274
-Dog.
-Dog.

393
00:26:38,476 --> 00:26:40,475
What's his name, huh? "Glenn."

394
00:26:40,636 --> 00:26:42,875
Kidding me. Who's the idiot
naming dogs these days?

395
00:26:43,076 --> 00:26:44,875
What do you wanna call him, Fido?

396
00:26:45,676 --> 00:26:46,915
Watch out!

397
00:26:53,637 --> 00:26:55,556
-Where's it coming from?
-l don't know.

398
00:26:55,758 --> 00:26:57,196
Lenihan, watch your head!

399
00:26:57,398 --> 00:26:58,517
On the roof!

400
00:27:01,758 --> 00:27:03,718
Enemy fire! Eleven o'clock!

401
00:27:03,918 --> 00:27:06,598
-They're on the roof! On the roof!
-Cover him!

402
00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:13,638
Twenty-five metres!
Twenty-five metres!

403
00:27:14,999 --> 00:27:17,759
-Lieutenant!
-Left flank, on the roof!

404
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,799
Covering, covering!

405
00:27:21,561 --> 00:27:23,280
-We gotta move now!
-Lockett!

406
00:27:23,481 --> 00:27:25,520
-Yes?
-Get me an exit down that alley!

407
00:27:25,721 --> 00:27:28,400
Yes, sergeant!
Kerns, Motown, let's go!

408
00:27:32,001 --> 00:27:33,361
Get up! Come on!

409
00:27:33,562 --> 00:27:34,880
Falling back!

410
00:27:35,082 --> 00:27:36,441
Let's go, come on!

411
00:27:36,642 --> 00:27:38,641
Enemy fire! Watch your head!

412
00:27:39,243 --> 00:27:40,961
-Where'd they come from?
-Fall back!

413
00:27:41,163 --> 00:27:43,121
Enemy fire, keep your head down!

414
00:27:43,323 --> 00:27:44,602
It's all over the damn place!

415
00:27:44,803 --> 00:27:45,843
What do you see?

416
00:27:46,043 --> 00:27:47,682
I don't know, man. I don't see shit.

417
00:27:48,004 --> 00:27:49,243
How do we get out of here?

418
00:27:49,443 --> 00:27:51,643
-Lieutenant, where's the exit?
-I'm working on it!

419
00:27:51,844 --> 00:27:54,723
-Shit, we're boxed in!
-I'll take a position by the wall! Go, go!

420
00:27:54,924 --> 00:27:56,644
-Move out!
-Ambush!

421
00:27:59,085 --> 00:28:00,123
I don't have him!

422
00:28:00,565 --> 00:28:01,564
I'm hit!

423
00:28:02,805 --> 00:28:04,164
Cover me, Lockett!

424
00:28:14,846 --> 00:28:17,366
-Man down, man down!
-lt burns!

425
00:28:20,967 --> 00:28:22,006
Shit!

426
00:28:22,927 --> 00:28:24,247
I got you, Guerrero!

427
00:28:29,328 --> 00:28:32,968
Lieutenant! Lieutenant!

428
00:28:38,289 --> 00:28:39,368
I've got you covered!

429
00:28:39,569 --> 00:28:42,128
We have an exit!
Everybody, move out! Move out!

430
00:28:42,330 --> 00:28:43,328
Move, move!

431
00:28:43,489 --> 00:28:47,409
Staff sergeant, we got an exit! Come
on, we're going! Come on, let's go!

432
00:28:48,770 --> 00:28:56,090
Fall back, fall back!

433
00:29:03,572 --> 00:29:05,932
Go, keep moving! Keep moving!

434
00:29:08,653 --> 00:29:10,052
Lorenzo!

435
00:29:10,253 --> 00:29:11,412
Move, move, move!

436
00:29:11,933 --> 00:29:13,772
Keep moving, keep moving,
keep moving!

437
00:29:14,613 --> 00:29:16,852
I can't see shit!

438
00:29:19,734 --> 00:29:22,733
Shit, shit, shit!
Imlay!

439
00:29:22,934 --> 00:29:24,854
Oh, God, oh, God, oh, God.

440
00:29:26,174 --> 00:29:27,533
U.S. Marines, coming in!

441
00:29:28,015 --> 00:29:29,734
U.S. Marines, anybody in here?

442
00:29:29,935 --> 00:29:32,334
Kitchen's clear!
The kitchen's clear, lieutenant!

443
00:29:32,816 --> 00:29:34,614
Get on that window! Are we clear?

444
00:29:34,815 --> 00:29:37,094
Put the wounded in the kitchen!

445
00:29:37,296 --> 00:29:39,375
Kerns, Lockett, secure the back
of this house.

446
00:29:39,536 --> 00:29:41,895
-Yes, staff sergeant.
-Staff sergeant, we're on it!

447
00:29:44,536 --> 00:29:46,856
Doc, how long
till they're able to move?

448
00:29:47,017 --> 00:29:49,336
Ten minutes. Ten minutes,
staff sergeant. Ten minutes.

449
00:29:49,537 --> 00:29:52,216
You want me?
Come get some! I'm right here!

450
00:29:52,418 --> 00:29:53,816
What do we got, lmlay?

451
00:29:54,018 --> 00:29:56,137
I got nothing.
I can't see a goddamn thing.

452
00:29:56,297 --> 00:29:58,577
-With this smoke, it's zero visibility.
-You're dead!

453
00:29:58,738 --> 00:29:59,978
Stow that shit, Simmons!

454
00:30:00,138 --> 00:30:02,497
You'll get shot before
you're able to kill any of them.

455
00:30:02,658 --> 00:30:03,697
Your orders, sir?

456
00:30:05,379 --> 00:30:07,458
I led us right into that ambush.

457
00:30:08,019 --> 00:30:10,659
-Mottola, anyone on command?
-No, sir.

458
00:30:10,859 --> 00:30:15,019
-We need to find answers to get out.
-You're in charge, sir. Your orders?

459
00:30:19,740 --> 00:30:21,220
Let's radio that evac to meet us.

460
00:30:21,381 --> 00:30:23,500
Civilians or no,
we gotta get these wounded out.

461
00:30:23,661 --> 00:30:25,940
-Roger that.
-Hey, guys, guys. Where's Lenihan?

462
00:30:26,341 --> 00:30:28,140
I didn't see him with us. Where is he?

463
00:30:28,342 --> 00:30:29,340
-Lenihan?
-Lenihan?

464
00:30:29,542 --> 00:30:30,901
Anybody got eyes on Lenihan?

465
00:30:31,102 --> 00:30:33,141
-Lenihan!
-I'll go for Lenihan, sir.

466
00:30:33,342 --> 00:30:36,302
Imlay, Harris, on me.
Let's get this shit out of here.

467
00:30:36,502 --> 00:30:38,701
I'll package the wounded.
Rally on 10th Street.

468
00:30:38,863 --> 00:30:41,141
Be prepared to move.
We're moving out soon.

469
00:30:42,383 --> 00:30:43,822
Shit.

470
00:30:51,944 --> 00:30:53,423
Mottorola.

471
00:30:53,984 --> 00:30:55,583
Mottorola?

472
00:30:57,505 --> 00:31:00,024
Oh, come on. Mottorola, you copy?

473
00:31:00,385 --> 00:31:01,425
Lenihan, where are you?

474
00:31:01,585 --> 00:31:02,984
Staff sergeant?

475
00:31:03,186 --> 00:31:06,745
Jesus Christ. l had to turn my radio
off. These things are everywhere.

476
00:31:06,945 --> 00:31:08,945
We're coming for you.
What's your location?

477
00:31:09,146 --> 00:31:12,266
I'm in the laundry room
of some apartment complex.

478
00:31:12,466 --> 00:31:14,146
It's like three storeys--

479
00:31:23,068 --> 00:31:27,187
What colour is it? Lenihan. Lenihan?

480
00:31:42,830 --> 00:31:44,309
Shit.

481
00:31:50,270 --> 00:31:53,670
Lenihan.

482
00:31:57,991 --> 00:31:59,431
Shit.

483
00:32:08,792 --> 00:32:10,272
So smooth....

484
00:32:11,833 --> 00:32:13,433
Smooth is fast.

485
00:32:14,394 --> 00:32:15,392
Shit.

486
00:32:22,434 --> 00:32:23,714
Oh, shit.

487
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:14,559
-Lenihan!
-Lenihan, lower that weapon!

488
00:33:16,361 --> 00:33:18,120
What the hell--?

489
00:33:26,961 --> 00:33:28,681
Keep on firing!

490
00:33:31,082 --> 00:33:32,921
Jesus Christ!
What the hell is that thing?

491
00:33:33,082 --> 00:33:36,402
It's not dead. They don't die. I've hit it
a hundred times. They don't die.

492
00:33:36,602 --> 00:33:39,682
Get separated from the unit again,
I'll find you and shoot you myself.

493
00:33:39,883 --> 00:33:42,362
Imlay, drop a grenade in that pool.
Let's move!

494
00:33:42,564 --> 00:33:44,483
Come on, l got you. l got you.

495
00:33:45,643 --> 00:33:46,923
Frag out.

496
00:33:58,685 --> 00:34:00,204
Street's clear.

497
00:34:01,725 --> 00:34:03,005
Get down, get down, get down.

498
00:34:03,286 --> 00:34:06,885
-What's happening? What's going on?
-All right, we're good. Come on.

499
00:34:11,527 --> 00:34:13,966
-lt's Lenihan.
-Yo, Lockett.

500
00:34:14,167 --> 00:34:18,247
You owe me $5. l told you, a virgin
ain't gonna die till he get him some.

501
00:34:18,447 --> 00:34:20,046
Move to the police station?

502
00:34:20,248 --> 00:34:23,367
-All right, let's move. Let's move.
-Move it. Move it out.

503
00:34:35,810 --> 00:34:38,089
-Where'd that come from?
-Door's open at the bank!

504
00:34:38,289 --> 00:34:39,528
Take care of him.

505
00:34:39,730 --> 00:34:40,969
Where'd the shot come from?

506
00:34:41,650 --> 00:34:43,849
-Kerns!
-Door's open on the bank! Let's move!

507
00:34:44,010 --> 00:34:46,610
Come on, let's go! Move! Move it!

508
00:34:47,770 --> 00:34:50,930
Stavrou, you got front. Stavrou,
cover front. Harris, cover front!

509
00:34:51,611 --> 00:34:53,450
Roof's clear, roof's clear!

510
00:34:53,612 --> 00:34:54,810
I got it. I got it covered.

511
00:34:55,012 --> 00:34:57,411
Harris! Find me where
that shot came from, guys!

512
00:34:57,612 --> 00:34:59,611
Imlay, get eyes up on that roof,
all right?

513
00:34:59,812 --> 00:35:02,011
-Cover the roof!
-Roof's clear, roof's clear!

514
00:35:02,212 --> 00:35:03,372
Lockett, on me!

515
00:35:03,572 --> 00:35:05,572
Did anybody even see
where that came from?

516
00:35:07,173 --> 00:35:08,172
Doc, how serious?

517
00:35:08,373 --> 00:35:11,053
Third degree thermal burns
on his neck and his face, sir.

518
00:35:12,414 --> 00:35:13,933
You'll be surfing soon, Simmons.

519
00:35:14,414 --> 00:35:15,613
Shit.

520
00:35:19,374 --> 00:35:21,493
-Hostiles, 12 o'clock!
-Hostiles at 12 o'clock!

521
00:35:21,694 --> 00:35:23,693
Staff sergeant, hostiles, 12 o'clock!

522
00:35:24,975 --> 00:35:25,974
Prepare to fire!

523
00:35:26,895 --> 00:35:28,335
Hold it, hold it!

524
00:35:28,535 --> 00:35:30,014
Friendlies, sir.

525
00:35:31,015 --> 00:35:34,655
-Shit.
-Friendlies. Let's get them in.

526
00:35:37,696 --> 00:35:38,695
Get over here.

527
00:35:42,577 --> 00:35:45,216
Move. Move to the back.
Let's go. Come on, get.

528
00:35:45,577 --> 00:35:49,056
-What's your unit?
-40th, lD.

529
00:35:49,337 --> 00:35:50,817
Where's the rest of your unit?

530
00:35:51,018 --> 00:35:53,297
Everyone else is either dead
or missing.

531
00:35:54,138 --> 00:35:55,977
I picked up Air Force here.

532
00:35:56,179 --> 00:35:58,257
Tech Sergeant Elena Santos,
Air Force.

533
00:35:58,459 --> 00:36:02,458
61st Wing, intel, surveillance,
recon division.

534
00:36:02,619 --> 00:36:04,738
Tech sergeant? What the hell
are you doing here?

535
00:36:05,139 --> 00:36:08,379
We were tracking enemy transmissions
about 12 klicks south of here.

536
00:36:08,580 --> 00:36:10,899
They ambushed us
like they knew our freaking address.

537
00:36:12,260 --> 00:36:13,259
I'm the only one left.

538
00:36:13,461 --> 00:36:17,179
I found these guys on the way to the
safe zone at Santa Monica Airport.

539
00:36:17,901 --> 00:36:19,940
You ready to use that weapon,
tech sergeant?

540
00:36:20,141 --> 00:36:24,141
With all due respect, staff sergeant,
I didn't get this far off of my good looks.

541
00:36:24,341 --> 00:36:26,141
-I'm ready for payback.
-Outstanding.

542
00:36:27,382 --> 00:36:30,221
Lieutenant, bird inbound,
25 minutes, sir.

543
00:36:30,422 --> 00:36:33,302
Roger that.
Let's get to that police station.

544
00:36:33,502 --> 00:36:35,982
All right, let's get Simmons and move.
Let's go!

545
00:36:39,743 --> 00:36:43,262
Cover our flanks, Mottorola!
To the right, in that building!

546
00:36:43,464 --> 00:36:44,503
Watch your feet!

547
00:36:44,704 --> 00:36:45,943
There's the police station.

548
00:36:46,104 --> 00:36:48,824
Let's get those civilians
and get back to the F.O.B.!

549
00:36:51,224 --> 00:36:53,024
Gotta rock, gotta rock!

550
00:36:58,665 --> 00:36:59,825
Come on, come on, come on.

551
00:37:00,506 --> 00:37:02,705
I'll stay with our wounded,
wait for the medevac.

552
00:37:02,906 --> 00:37:05,425
I'll go for civilians.
Kerns, Dever, on me.

553
00:37:05,587 --> 00:37:08,505
-Mags, mags. I need mags.
-All right.

554
00:37:08,906 --> 00:37:12,306
Santos, when that bird arrives,
I'll need your help on this stretcher.

555
00:37:13,067 --> 00:37:14,826
U.S. Marines! U.S. Marines!

556
00:37:16,467 --> 00:37:17,867
Door. The door.

557
00:37:18,468 --> 00:37:19,747
-Elevator right.
-Clear!

558
00:37:19,948 --> 00:37:21,387
Elevator right.

559
00:37:21,828 --> 00:37:24,508
Second elevator, clear! No pulse.

560
00:37:25,948 --> 00:37:27,348
Door left.

561
00:37:28,029 --> 00:37:29,028
It's locked.

562
00:37:29,229 --> 00:37:30,468
-What's your name?
-Harper.

563
00:37:30,669 --> 00:37:33,389
-I'm gonna need you on this stretcher.
-Bird incoming, sir!

564
00:37:33,589 --> 00:37:36,229
Roger that. lmlay, pop smoke!

565
00:37:40,350 --> 00:37:42,229
-Door locked.
-Door left.

566
00:37:44,830 --> 00:37:46,350
Radios off.

567
00:37:56,312 --> 00:37:57,711
Move.

568
00:38:24,795 --> 00:38:27,035
U.S. Marines! U.S. Marines!

569
00:38:28,916 --> 00:38:30,835
-How many of you?
-Five of us, three kids.

570
00:38:31,036 --> 00:38:32,515
Kerns, kids!

571
00:38:34,956 --> 00:38:36,395
-Let's move!
-Let's go, let's go!

572
00:38:36,596 --> 00:38:39,396
All right, let's get ready to move!
Let's get it up!

573
00:38:41,877 --> 00:38:43,556
-Here we go! Let's move!
-Aye, sir!

574
00:38:43,757 --> 00:38:46,436
We got room for four and that is it!
That is it.

575
00:38:46,638 --> 00:38:48,876
-Get your wounded on! Move it!
-Oh, yeah, baby.

576
00:38:49,078 --> 00:38:51,157
Come on. Come on. Get up. Get up.

577
00:38:51,358 --> 00:38:52,958
Get him in. Hey, Guerrero.

578
00:38:54,439 --> 00:38:56,318
I'll work on that mix for you!

579
00:38:56,519 --> 00:38:59,798
I'm gonna need it, dude! You're
gonna be fine! You're gonna be fine!

580
00:39:00,239 --> 00:39:01,479
Give them hell!

581
00:39:03,599 --> 00:39:05,078
-Oh, shit.
-Come on, man.

582
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:08,359
You just had to get out of the shit.

583
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:10,279
-You take care of yourself!
-l will.

584
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:12,239
I'll see you soon, partner.

585
00:39:13,241 --> 00:39:15,079
-That's it.
-We have civilians coming out!

586
00:39:15,281 --> 00:39:17,480
-We can't take them, we got no room!
-Make room!

587
00:39:17,681 --> 00:39:19,561
We can't! Now, get back, sir!

588
00:39:19,761 --> 00:39:22,760
Fall back.
Move back, move back, move back!

589
00:39:27,162 --> 00:39:29,361
Wait! Kids, kids!

590
00:39:43,444 --> 00:39:45,323
Get back to the police station!

591
00:39:50,285 --> 00:39:52,484
Backtrack, everybody! Come on, back!

592
00:40:00,926 --> 00:40:04,765
They have air power. Again, enemy
has air support. We have a bird down.

593
00:40:04,967 --> 00:40:06,206
Damn it!

594
00:40:06,406 --> 00:40:08,126
Tango's heading northeast of our grid.

595
00:40:08,327 --> 00:40:11,126
We've disengaged back into a
police station. We have civilians.

596
00:40:11,327 --> 00:40:13,487
I say again, we have civilians.

597
00:40:13,687 --> 00:40:16,887
Lockett, Kerns, secure this door.
Nothing gets in, you understand?

598
00:40:20,209 --> 00:40:23,728
We got a body. Do you think you could
get rid of it so the kids don't see it?

599
00:40:23,928 --> 00:40:25,608
What do you want?
Where should we go?

600
00:40:25,769 --> 00:40:26,807
Dever.

601
00:40:27,009 --> 00:40:28,648
Set up back there, okay?

602
00:40:31,050 --> 00:40:33,449
Come on, you guys. Take the back.

603
00:40:33,650 --> 00:40:35,609
Stay away from the window, all right?

604
00:40:35,810 --> 00:40:38,969
Are there gonna be more choppers?
Did you guys call any in?

605
00:40:40,530 --> 00:40:44,130
I'm sure they're gonna come for us.
They know where we are.

606
00:40:46,571 --> 00:40:48,810
Shit.
You okay? You all right?

607
00:40:48,971 --> 00:40:50,371
-I'm good. Yeah.
-You sure?

608
00:40:50,571 --> 00:40:53,971
-You didn't get hit or nothing?
-No, I'm good, man. I'm good.

609
00:40:55,212 --> 00:40:57,652
Man, they're gone. They're gone.

610
00:40:57,852 --> 00:41:00,212
Everybody's gone.
Lenihan, Guerrero, Grayston.

611
00:41:00,613 --> 00:41:02,372
Grayston. Grayston had kids.

612
00:41:02,533 --> 00:41:04,332
Didn't deserve that.
Didn't deserve that!

613
00:41:04,493 --> 00:41:06,172
He didn't deserve to go out like that!

614
00:41:06,373 --> 00:41:10,133
Neither do you! You hear me?
You're gonna make it through this!

615
00:41:10,973 --> 00:41:14,533
All right? You're gonna get out of here.
You're gonna marry Cherise.

616
00:41:14,734 --> 00:41:16,493
And you're gonna be her problem...

617
00:41:16,695 --> 00:41:20,054
...because I'm done taking care
of your sorry ass, you got that?

618
00:41:22,695 --> 00:41:25,534
All stations, this net. Sitrep as follow:

619
00:41:25,695 --> 00:41:28,615
Enemy aircraft
number four fleets at this time.

620
00:41:28,815 --> 00:41:32,015
Be advised, more entering battle
space Los Angeles from ocean...

621
00:41:32,176 --> 00:41:34,455
...on bearing 2-niner-7-5-0.

622
00:41:34,657 --> 00:41:36,816
They got air support too.

623
00:41:37,617 --> 00:41:40,256
Knocked our bird right out of the sky.

624
00:41:41,258 --> 00:41:43,177
So much for ruling the air.

625
00:41:44,617 --> 00:41:46,777
There's no time for that, lieutenant.

626
00:41:46,978 --> 00:41:48,737
Those bombs are gonna drop.

627
00:41:49,578 --> 00:41:51,617
And we're in the blast radius.

628
00:41:52,659 --> 00:41:55,137
Top of my goddamn class.

629
00:41:55,579 --> 00:41:59,698
And l get out in combat in the middle
of that shit? Goddamn it!

630
00:41:59,900 --> 00:42:02,339
I already lost four
of my goddamn men!

631
00:42:03,060 --> 00:42:04,139
Four good men.

632
00:42:04,300 --> 00:42:06,379
Who would go to hell and back
for you, sir.

633
00:42:11,381 --> 00:42:12,540
-Have you?
-Yes.

634
00:42:12,741 --> 00:42:15,580
You're not the first to lose men.
You won't be the last.

635
00:42:15,781 --> 00:42:18,021
Now, put that away.
You understand me?

636
00:42:18,221 --> 00:42:20,660
Right now your men are
awaiting orders.

637
00:42:21,662 --> 00:42:24,742
Now, you can go left, you can go right.
I don't give a damn.

638
00:42:25,303 --> 00:42:27,222
Just make a decision.

639
00:42:28,823 --> 00:42:30,302
Lieutenant.

640
00:42:30,703 --> 00:42:33,102
It's a no-go on the helo, sir.

641
00:42:33,303 --> 00:42:35,102
Enemy aircraft is lighting it up.

642
00:42:35,304 --> 00:42:37,503
Command says it's like nothing
they ever seen.

643
00:42:37,703 --> 00:42:39,383
We gotta find a way out.

644
00:42:39,583 --> 00:42:41,703
We gotta get to that F.O.B.

645
00:42:41,904 --> 00:42:44,663
You're right. We gotta move.

646
00:42:44,865 --> 00:42:47,823
Let's get these people safe.
Lockett, Kerns!

647
00:42:48,025 --> 00:42:50,504
I need you to set up
an observation post on the roof.

648
00:42:50,705 --> 00:42:52,944
We're gonna move by foot,
so we gotta move fast.

649
00:42:53,106 --> 00:42:55,665
Scan for hostiles,
find the best route out of here.

650
00:42:55,826 --> 00:42:57,264
All right, sir.

651
00:42:58,706 --> 00:42:59,705
Lieutenant.

652
00:43:04,706 --> 00:43:08,666
Officials are now saying any civilian
within 10 miles of the coast...

653
00:43:08,867 --> 00:43:10,387
...should try to make their way...

654
00:43:10,548 --> 00:43:12,386
...to a military
forward operating base, F.O.B.

655
00:43:14,027 --> 00:43:16,387
This is the safest place
that you could be right now.

656
00:43:16,588 --> 00:43:20,347
Now, the military has set up a line
of defence to try to protect civilians.

657
00:43:21,268 --> 00:43:24,468
Take a look at you, make sure
you're okay, all right? Good. Okay.

658
00:43:24,669 --> 00:43:28,148
Just look at this. There you go.

659
00:43:28,349 --> 00:43:31,189
-Water fountain is there, Mr. Rincon.
-Okay, thank you.

660
00:43:31,390 --> 00:43:32,629
-No problem.
-Thank you.

661
00:43:35,750 --> 00:43:38,230
-Joe Rincon.
-Staff Sergeant Nantz.

662
00:43:38,430 --> 00:43:39,549
This is my son, Hector.

663
00:43:39,751 --> 00:43:43,270
We all wanted to thank you
for coming to get us.

664
00:43:44,191 --> 00:43:45,350
Yeah.

665
00:43:45,551 --> 00:43:48,190
Hey, Hector. We leave no man behind.

666
00:43:49,192 --> 00:43:51,271
So you here
when the police got overrun?

667
00:43:53,512 --> 00:43:57,192
Right. Well, long as you're both okay.

668
00:43:58,872 --> 00:44:00,352
Hey, you all right, man?

669
00:44:00,953 --> 00:44:02,632
Yeah. Yeah, I'm good.

670
00:44:02,833 --> 00:44:04,153
Okay.

671
00:44:05,353 --> 00:44:07,753
If you-- lf you need him
to do anything...

672
00:44:08,434 --> 00:44:11,073
-...you know.
-I'll let you know.

673
00:44:13,714 --> 00:44:15,193
Aye-aye, sir.

674
00:44:15,635 --> 00:44:16,914
Aye.

675
00:44:17,715 --> 00:44:19,194
Thank you.

676
00:44:23,315 --> 00:44:25,995
We got two dozen hostiles
about 300 metres out.

677
00:44:26,196 --> 00:44:29,635
Lieutenant, we got two dozen hostiles
300 metres north, over.

678
00:44:31,796 --> 00:44:34,356
It's like those things are on overwatch,
just like us.

679
00:44:35,877 --> 00:44:38,796
That one out front looks like
the leader. Now they got leadership.

680
00:44:38,957 --> 00:44:40,757
So do ants, Kerns.

681
00:44:41,237 --> 00:44:43,557
You think those things get scared too?

682
00:44:44,598 --> 00:44:48,598
Probably just like us. They're probably
just grunts that get told to go fight.

683
00:44:48,798 --> 00:44:53,638
Come on. Find us a way out of here,
Marine, because we're sitting ducks.

684
00:44:53,839 --> 00:44:56,278
They dragged them out of the house,
into the street...

685
00:44:56,440 --> 00:44:58,678
...put them in perfect order
before they shot them.

686
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:00,359
They shot them right in the head.

687
00:45:00,520 --> 00:45:02,879
Chief, do we have any idea
why this is happening?

688
00:45:03,080 --> 00:45:06,320
Well, it's clear there has been no
attempt at any kind of communication.

689
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:08,600
No demands, nothing like that.

690
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:11,280
So, obviously,
they are here for our resources.

691
00:45:13,161 --> 00:45:14,840
When you invade a place
for resources...

692
00:45:15,001 --> 00:45:16,841
...you wipe out
the indigenous population.

693
00:45:17,002 --> 00:45:18,960
Those are the rules
of any colonisation.

694
00:45:19,442 --> 00:45:22,601
And, right now,
we are being colonised.

695
00:45:23,202 --> 00:45:24,721
Brave kids.

696
00:45:24,923 --> 00:45:28,922
They're my nieces. My sister and her
husband are away on vacation.

697
00:45:31,723 --> 00:45:35,923
Thing is, they live in Arizona.
I see them once or twice a year.

698
00:45:36,844 --> 00:45:39,003
And now I may be all they have left.

699
00:45:39,764 --> 00:45:42,203
-You have kids?
-No.

700
00:45:42,404 --> 00:45:44,203
Neither do I.

701
00:45:45,284 --> 00:45:48,565
I used to regret that,
but maybe it was for the best.

702
00:45:48,765 --> 00:45:51,285
Of course, our planet's surface
is 70 percent water.

703
00:45:51,446 --> 00:45:54,005
So again, and l have to stress this,
without certainty...

704
00:45:54,205 --> 00:45:57,445
...the leading hypothesis remains
that their objective, their target...

705
00:45:57,646 --> 00:45:58,645
...is our water.

706
00:45:59,367 --> 00:46:02,445
-Shit.
-There ain't gonna be nothing left.

707
00:46:03,447 --> 00:46:05,847
-l think l got a way out of here.
-What'd you say?

708
00:46:06,007 --> 00:46:07,846
Right here, look. 200 metres out.

709
00:46:08,087 --> 00:46:10,087
-What's right behind that backside?
-Bus.

710
00:46:10,488 --> 00:46:12,927
-Lieutenant, we got a bus.
-Roger that.

711
00:46:13,127 --> 00:46:16,287
So the men on the roof saw a bus.
They think it could be operational.

712
00:46:16,488 --> 00:46:19,167
Maybe we'd be better off on foot.

713
00:46:20,568 --> 00:46:22,208
It's miles to the operating base...

714
00:46:22,449 --> 00:46:24,648
...and those bombs
are gonna drop in an hour.

715
00:46:24,889 --> 00:46:25,849
We gotta move fast.

716
00:46:26,970 --> 00:46:28,569
Bus is a big target.

717
00:46:28,730 --> 00:46:29,929
I made the call.

718
00:46:30,890 --> 00:46:32,730
It's my responsibility.

719
00:46:33,050 --> 00:46:34,529
Stavrou, Harris.

720
00:46:34,730 --> 00:46:37,569
Lieutenant needs recon on a bus.
If it runs, get it back here.

721
00:46:37,811 --> 00:46:41,570
-You know how to hotwire a bus?
-Stavrou can. He's from Jersey, sir.

722
00:46:42,052 --> 00:46:43,090
Ladies first.

723
00:46:46,491 --> 00:46:47,891
Two hundred metres.

724
00:46:48,092 --> 00:46:50,811
Go down, there's the cars burnt out,
there's a pickup truck.

725
00:46:51,012 --> 00:46:52,411
Right back behind there.

726
00:46:54,133 --> 00:46:57,052
We have a situation.
Y'all need to follow me.

727
00:46:58,933 --> 00:47:01,852
Harris found it out here.
Y'all gotta see this thing.

728
00:47:11,334 --> 00:47:13,694
Weapon looks like it's been
surgically attached.

729
00:47:13,894 --> 00:47:15,934
Talk about commitment to cause.

730
00:47:22,056 --> 00:47:23,615
Shit.

731
00:47:25,576 --> 00:47:28,256
-You gotta be kidding!
-Corporal. Corporal, hold it.

732
00:47:29,057 --> 00:47:31,816
Let me shoot this thing, staff sergeant.
That weapon's hot.

733
00:47:32,057 --> 00:47:33,056
Let me just shoot it.

734
00:47:33,217 --> 00:47:34,376
-Doc.
-Yes, staff sergeant.

735
00:47:35,457 --> 00:47:36,617
Oh, Lord, have mercy.

736
00:47:38,177 --> 00:47:40,297
We need to know exactly
where to hit this thing...

737
00:47:40,458 --> 00:47:42,177
...so we don't waste all our ammo.

738
00:47:44,059 --> 00:47:45,577
Maybe I can help.

739
00:47:45,778 --> 00:47:47,217
I'm a veterinarian.

740
00:47:59,540 --> 00:48:01,099
Sure you wanna do this?

741
00:48:01,341 --> 00:48:03,940
I was more sure when
I was standing over there.

742
00:48:04,741 --> 00:48:06,699
We gotta figure out
how to kill these things.

743
00:48:06,860 --> 00:48:09,981
Otherwise, we won't last another
five minutes out there, okay?

744
00:48:11,461 --> 00:48:13,340
Let's peel this back.

745
00:48:16,581 --> 00:48:19,781
-Look at this, we got a organ here.
-Jesus Christ, look at that.

746
00:48:20,543 --> 00:48:21,862
-I got another one.
-Me too.

747
00:48:22,023 --> 00:48:24,941
Does it have some sort of
cognitive mechanism? Anything?

748
00:48:25,263 --> 00:48:27,982
There's no frontal lobe,
no temporal lobe, no parietal lobe.

749
00:48:28,224 --> 00:48:29,863
The cranial vault is unlike anything.

750
00:48:30,063 --> 00:48:31,463
-Oh, shit.
-What?

751
00:48:31,624 --> 00:48:33,143
-You see what I'm seeing?
-What?

752
00:48:33,343 --> 00:48:35,503
The ones that were just
on the roof aren't on it.

753
00:48:35,664 --> 00:48:37,623
There's about two dozen
coming out the door.

754
00:48:37,864 --> 00:48:39,623
They're on the street heading this way.

755
00:48:39,784 --> 00:48:42,184
-Lieutenant, we got movement up here.
-Roger that.

756
00:48:42,345 --> 00:48:44,824
We have contact 300 metres out.
We gotta cut quick.

757
00:48:52,066 --> 00:48:53,865
Lieutenant, we gotta move!
What do we do?

758
00:48:54,026 --> 00:48:56,425
-Shit's hitting the fan. Gotta move.
-Staff sergeant.

759
00:48:56,626 --> 00:48:58,746
Come on, how do you kill this thing?

760
00:49:07,148 --> 00:49:08,667
Goddamn it, Stavs.

761
00:49:08,987 --> 00:49:10,987
-I lost them.
-You lost them?

762
00:49:11,668 --> 00:49:14,667
Lieutenant, they're gone.
Lieutenant, I don't see anything.

763
00:49:15,828 --> 00:49:18,548
-We got a breach.
-Got a breach on the north entrance!

764
00:49:18,749 --> 00:49:19,788
They're inside.

765
00:49:19,949 --> 00:49:22,268
I'm gonna gather everyone
by the doors on the south side.

766
00:49:22,429 --> 00:49:23,948
We're right behind you.

767
00:49:24,150 --> 00:49:25,588
What was that?

768
00:49:25,790 --> 00:49:28,109
-Adukwu, you go with her.
-Yes, staff sergeant.

769
00:49:28,430 --> 00:49:31,349
-Imlay, got an HE grenade round?
-Never leave home without it.

770
00:49:31,550 --> 00:49:33,829
You cover that hall to the rear.
Buy me some time.

771
00:49:34,031 --> 00:49:36,630
They start coming,
you blast the hell out of them.

772
00:49:36,991 --> 00:49:39,150
Hey, Harris.
Where's that goddamn bus?

773
00:49:39,351 --> 00:49:42,111
Stavs. Stavs, we got an enemy scout.
Come on, let's go.

774
00:49:43,872 --> 00:49:47,671
Yes! Yes! Yeah, baby!
Newark! Represent!

775
00:49:47,872 --> 00:49:49,991
Lieutenant, we've got the bus,
heading back.

776
00:49:50,192 --> 00:49:52,392
Okay, guys, the bus is en route!
Bus is en route!

777
00:49:52,592 --> 00:49:54,472
Thirty seconds till we move out!

778
00:50:00,634 --> 00:50:03,152
Imlay, give me a sitrep.
I need an update on the breach.

779
00:50:03,314 --> 00:50:05,153
Report back, over.

780
00:50:10,795 --> 00:50:12,114
We're running out of time.

781
00:50:21,836 --> 00:50:23,035
Move!

782
00:50:26,837 --> 00:50:28,515
Contact!

783
00:50:29,517 --> 00:50:30,956
They've breached.

784
00:50:36,158 --> 00:50:37,196
This is our last shot.

785
00:50:37,958 --> 00:50:39,437
Got it.

786
00:50:39,998 --> 00:50:41,517
Right here.

787
00:50:47,519 --> 00:50:50,719
That's gotta be it. It's dying.

788
00:50:55,159 --> 00:50:58,359
That's how we kill this thing, to
the right of where the heart would be.

789
00:50:58,520 --> 00:50:59,839
-Got it.
-I got three more!

790
00:51:04,161 --> 00:51:05,720
Let's get out of here.

791
00:51:09,081 --> 00:51:12,440
Get them on the bus! Get them
on that bus! Let's go, let's go!

792
00:51:17,442 --> 00:51:19,681
-Get on.
-Get underneath.

793
00:51:20,763 --> 00:51:21,802
You okay?

794
00:51:25,564 --> 00:51:29,442
Heads up. Cover your sectors of fire.
Heads up!

795
00:51:32,884 --> 00:51:36,963
Marines, concentrate firepower to
the right of where the heart would be.

796
00:51:37,124 --> 00:51:38,483
Yes, staff sergeant.

797
00:51:39,365 --> 00:51:40,803
That's how we kill these things.

798
00:51:42,685 --> 00:51:44,244
All right, remember your training.

799
00:51:44,405 --> 00:51:46,405
We got a hostile warbird,
thousand metres out.

800
00:51:46,565 --> 00:51:47,845
Everybody keep your eyes up.

801
00:51:55,886 --> 00:51:57,726
All buckled up back there, lieutenant.

802
00:51:57,927 --> 00:51:59,286
Roger that.

803
00:51:59,726 --> 00:52:02,486
It should be about
six miles to the F.O.B.

804
00:52:02,687 --> 00:52:04,487
I don't know, 25, 30 minutes.

805
00:52:04,847 --> 00:52:06,606
If we stay on these side streets.

806
00:52:06,808 --> 00:52:09,447
Air Force is gonna level this area
in 40 minutes.

807
00:52:15,449 --> 00:52:18,649
Get us to the forward operating base.
Fast.

808
00:52:32,571 --> 00:52:34,289
What the hell is that?

809
00:52:35,131 --> 00:52:36,290
Stavrou, stop the bus.

810
00:52:51,773 --> 00:52:52,852
Everyone, get down.

811
00:53:08,015 --> 00:53:10,774
Any station, this is
Foxtrot-Two-November. Sitrep to follow.

812
00:53:10,975 --> 00:53:12,934
Go ahead, Foxtrot-Two-November.

813
00:53:13,135 --> 00:53:15,295
Enemy aircraft.
They're lighting up the sky...

814
00:53:15,495 --> 00:53:18,015
...heading east towards
downtown Los Angeles.

815
00:53:18,216 --> 00:53:19,295
Copy that.

816
00:53:21,976 --> 00:53:23,255
They're tracking our signals.

817
00:53:26,777 --> 00:53:29,376
Mottola, turn off that radio!
They're tracking our signals!

818
00:53:29,577 --> 00:53:31,737
All radios off! Cell phones, everything!

819
00:53:33,538 --> 00:53:35,137
Give me your radio.

820
00:53:38,698 --> 00:53:40,617
Mottola. Give me your radio.

821
00:53:43,978 --> 00:53:44,978
Where you going?

822
00:53:45,139 --> 00:53:47,218
-Staff sergeant!
-Where the hell is he going?

823
00:53:55,460 --> 00:53:59,980
-We gotta get off this bus, all right?
-Ten o'clock, lieutenant, 10 o'clock!

824
00:54:00,180 --> 00:54:03,180
I see it, 8 o'clock, heading south!

825
00:54:03,381 --> 00:54:06,380
It's getting closer. Hey, it's on my six!

826
00:54:13,222 --> 00:54:14,901
A hundred metres!

827
00:54:21,983 --> 00:54:23,142
Oh, my God.

828
00:54:25,784 --> 00:54:27,503
Everybody, get down!

829
00:54:40,746 --> 00:54:42,584
Holy shit.

830
00:55:20,389 --> 00:55:22,269
-What was that?
-Is he all right?

831
00:55:22,469 --> 00:55:24,829
-Did he make it out?
-Staff sergeant?

832
00:55:40,551 --> 00:55:43,272
-There he is.
-Staff sergeant's alive!

833
00:55:43,472 --> 00:55:45,511
-Yeah, he's alive!
-There he is!

834
00:56:18,436 --> 00:56:20,795
That aircraft was unmanned,
Iieutenant.

835
00:56:21,557 --> 00:56:23,036
Drone.

836
00:56:30,117 --> 00:56:32,956
That was some real John Wayne shit,
staff sergeant.

837
00:56:40,798 --> 00:56:42,198
Hey.

838
00:56:43,399 --> 00:56:46,239
I can't afford to lose you.
Neither can these men, all right?

839
00:56:47,880 --> 00:56:49,639
Yeah. They're your men.

840
00:56:52,360 --> 00:56:53,920
All right, staff sergeant!

841
00:56:57,120 --> 00:56:58,640
That's how you do it!

842
00:56:58,841 --> 00:57:00,920
-That's retreat, hell!
-That's right.

843
00:57:01,321 --> 00:57:03,680
Who the hell's John Wayne?

844
00:57:13,962 --> 00:57:15,481
Everybody, eyes open!

845
00:57:15,683 --> 00:57:17,282
Stay alert!

846
00:57:18,243 --> 00:57:20,042
Thank you for that.

847
00:57:24,324 --> 00:57:25,762
It's nothing.

848
00:57:27,044 --> 00:57:28,843
What's that mean, "retreat, hell"?

849
00:57:32,644 --> 00:57:37,084
During World War I, an officer from
our regiment was ordered to retreat.

850
00:57:37,285 --> 00:57:41,804
He said, "Retreat, hell.
We just got here."

851
00:57:45,686 --> 00:57:48,045
You should have the doc
take a look at that.

852
00:57:48,767 --> 00:57:50,205
I thought you were a doctor.

853
00:57:50,807 --> 00:57:53,246
Animals and aliens only.

854
00:57:53,887 --> 00:57:55,966
I'll put it on my to-do list.

855
00:57:56,647 --> 00:57:57,886
Thank you.

856
00:58:07,648 --> 00:58:10,648
Excuse me, staff sergeant. Did you
say that was an unmanned drone?

857
00:58:10,849 --> 00:58:12,168
Correct.

858
00:58:13,169 --> 00:58:15,929
They must have one hell of
a command-and-control system.

859
00:58:16,610 --> 00:58:19,049
If NORTHCOM didn't agree with you,
I wouldn't be here.

860
00:58:19,249 --> 00:58:20,609
Why?

861
00:58:21,890 --> 00:58:25,650
My mission was to provide AIS
with a strike package.

862
00:58:25,970 --> 00:58:27,330
A strike package?

863
00:58:27,531 --> 00:58:31,090
Yeah, coordinates for a missile strike
on a command-and-control centre.

864
00:58:31,291 --> 00:58:35,050
But the asset fell off
the grid and we lost them.

865
00:58:44,573 --> 00:58:47,892
All side streets are blocked.
Our only choice is to take the freeway.

866
00:58:48,933 --> 00:58:51,173
All right. Well, it's your call.

867
00:58:51,373 --> 00:58:53,012
Stavrou, get us on a freeway.

868
00:58:54,134 --> 00:58:57,853
We don't wanna be in this area
when these bombs start to fall.

869
00:59:20,497 --> 00:59:22,656
Try to miss at least
one of the cars, Stavrou.

870
00:59:24,457 --> 00:59:25,976
Just keep driving.

871
00:59:26,897 --> 00:59:28,416
Off ramp is one mile ahead.

872
00:59:35,018 --> 00:59:36,057
Jesus.

873
00:59:37,338 --> 00:59:38,738
Look out.

874
00:59:44,579 --> 00:59:47,899
The ramp, it's gone, lieutenant.

875
00:59:53,220 --> 00:59:56,020
All right, Robertson exit,
half a click away.

876
00:59:57,740 --> 00:59:59,380
Look out! Incoming, 12 o'clock!

877
01:00:08,222 --> 01:00:10,021
-You okay?
-Harper!

878
01:00:17,303 --> 01:00:19,822
Tank's drawing enemy fire!
It's a good time to move!

879
01:00:20,023 --> 01:00:22,182
I'll suppress the fire,
you take the civilians!

880
01:00:22,384 --> 01:00:24,303
Secure this exit, Imlay!

881
01:00:27,784 --> 01:00:30,224
Imlay, get me a defensive line
on that vehicle!

882
01:00:33,785 --> 01:00:36,424
-Move, move, move!
-Let's go! Come on.

883
01:00:36,625 --> 01:00:39,064
-Let's go!
-Come on, stay down, stay down!

884
01:00:44,026 --> 01:00:46,946
Just keep everybody calm.
We'll be right back, all right?

885
01:00:47,146 --> 01:00:48,785
All right. Safety first, buddy.

886
01:00:51,906 --> 01:00:56,547
Martinez, if we get the civilians to that
helo, they take cover, rappel down.

887
01:00:56,747 --> 01:00:59,387
I got a dozen up on the bridge.
They're moving down.

888
01:00:59,628 --> 01:01:02,827
Lieutenant! Tank's out!
Nothing's stopping them now!

889
01:01:05,628 --> 01:01:09,308
Staff sergeant, civilians won't make it
to that helo without cover fire.

890
01:01:10,309 --> 01:01:12,268
Lockett, Kerns, on me, let's go!

891
01:01:12,470 --> 01:01:14,588
Let's move, let's move, let's move!

892
01:01:18,830 --> 01:01:20,629
Get the civilians down, all right?
Move!

893
01:01:25,670 --> 01:01:27,110
Come on!

894
01:01:30,432 --> 01:01:31,870
About a 30-foot drop. Let's go.

895
01:01:32,072 --> 01:01:36,351
Get behind the bus!
Now, now, now! Get behind it!

896
01:01:36,792 --> 01:01:39,592
Kids first! Around the body,
bring them down one at a time.

897
01:01:39,792 --> 01:01:41,112
Roger that.

898
01:01:42,753 --> 01:01:44,192
Imlay!

899
01:01:44,993 --> 01:01:46,872
Get your team
up on that garbage truck!

900
01:01:47,073 --> 01:01:50,553
Staff sergeant, cover us up front!
Stavs, you're with me! On me now!

901
01:01:52,273 --> 01:01:55,913
We're gonna run behind that helicopter
and we're gonna rope down, all right?

902
01:01:56,194 --> 01:01:57,353
The girls will be first.

903
01:01:57,514 --> 01:02:00,394
I promise you nothing's
gonna happen. Okay? Stay down!

904
01:02:02,674 --> 01:02:05,194
Lieutenant, dozen hostiles,
maybe more!

905
01:02:05,355 --> 01:02:07,794
Four hundred metres
and closing fast!

906
01:02:08,276 --> 01:02:10,595
Cover, cover!
What the hell are you doing?

907
01:02:10,796 --> 01:02:12,315
You guys need another gun.

908
01:02:13,436 --> 01:02:16,115
Three o'clock. Up on the bridge,
Santos. Up on the bridge.

909
01:02:16,316 --> 01:02:18,035
Incoming!

910
01:02:25,197 --> 01:02:26,757
Ten o'clock!

911
01:02:31,638 --> 01:02:33,717
-Reloading!
-Aim for the leader!

912
01:02:37,919 --> 01:02:39,878
Hell, you can take all the room
you want.

913
01:02:40,239 --> 01:02:42,238
Mottola, move, move, move!

914
01:02:42,440 --> 01:02:46,879
Yes, staff sergeant! Come on, let's go!
Let's go, go, go! Run now, run!

915
01:02:47,080 --> 01:02:50,520
Keep running! Don't stop, run!
Run, run, run!

916
01:02:57,121 --> 01:02:59,281
-Get in there!
-Cover me!

917
01:03:01,121 --> 01:03:03,921
-I'm going for the .50 cal!
-Hurry up!

918
01:03:09,603 --> 01:03:11,202
Get some, Lockett.

919
01:03:22,164 --> 01:03:24,283
-Shit.
-What the hell is that thing?

920
01:03:24,484 --> 01:03:25,963
I'm engaging!

921
01:03:29,205 --> 01:03:32,964
You'll be okay, all right? It's okay.
Listen to me. You're going to be okay.

922
01:03:33,165 --> 01:03:36,004
I got you. I will not let anything
happen to you, all right?

923
01:03:42,086 --> 01:03:43,285
Shit!

924
01:03:44,886 --> 01:03:46,645
Man down!

925
01:03:47,047 --> 01:03:50,046
You're gonna be okay. Hold on,
hold on! Keep going. Hold on!

926
01:03:50,527 --> 01:03:52,166
Keep looking up!

927
01:03:59,488 --> 01:04:00,927
Oh, God!

928
01:04:01,169 --> 01:04:02,887
I got you. It's okay. It's okay.

929
01:04:03,089 --> 01:04:05,847
Get the ant that's controlling
that thing!

930
01:04:09,169 --> 01:04:10,489
Lockett, get off your ass!

931
01:04:16,450 --> 01:04:17,649
It's turning this way!

932
01:04:17,850 --> 01:04:20,650
It's about to hit the fan, guys.
Get out now! Move!

933
01:04:20,850 --> 01:04:22,410
Santos, come on!

934
01:04:23,251 --> 01:04:24,730
-Come on!
-I'm stuck.

935
01:04:24,931 --> 01:04:26,170
Go!

936
01:04:27,331 --> 01:04:29,090
-What are you doing?
-Go!

937
01:04:30,612 --> 01:04:32,050
Imlay!

938
01:04:42,973 --> 01:04:44,172
Where's Stavrou?

939
01:04:48,894 --> 01:04:50,333
Mottorola! How many down?

940
01:04:51,974 --> 01:04:54,374
Two down, staff sarge! One to go!

941
01:04:54,574 --> 01:04:56,893
Look at me, look at me. Look, look.
Be good, okay?

942
01:04:57,095 --> 01:05:00,734
-It's gonna be fine, okay? You ready?
-Lieutenant, C-4!

943
01:05:02,975 --> 01:05:04,535
Let's blow this sucker to hell!

944
01:05:05,456 --> 01:05:06,935
Let's do it.

945
01:05:08,176 --> 01:05:09,295
Kerns!

946
01:05:15,617 --> 01:05:17,136
Covering!

947
01:05:28,418 --> 01:05:29,817
All right, dough is good to go!

948
01:05:30,018 --> 01:05:31,737
-Go!
-Covering!

949
01:05:36,899 --> 01:05:39,258
Damn it! We've lost the detonator.

950
01:05:40,300 --> 01:05:43,299
-You all right?
-Yeah, got the wind knocked out of me.

951
01:05:49,901 --> 01:05:51,420
-Mottorola!
-Dad!

952
01:05:51,861 --> 01:05:53,660
You're okay, Hector! You're okay.

953
01:05:53,821 --> 01:05:55,180
Hold on!

954
01:05:58,542 --> 01:06:01,340
-I need bandages from the first aid kit.
-Sir! Sir!

955
01:06:01,542 --> 01:06:02,901
It's okay!

956
01:06:09,862 --> 01:06:11,422
Oh, my God!

957
01:06:12,263 --> 01:06:13,262
All right.

958
01:06:28,105 --> 01:06:29,984
We gotta get you to a medevac.

959
01:06:30,185 --> 01:06:31,625
Doc!

960
01:06:35,625 --> 01:06:36,625
Oh, shit, man!

961
01:06:36,786 --> 01:06:38,465
-We need some cover!
-Damn it, I'm out!

962
01:06:38,626 --> 01:06:40,826
-Got another mag, Lockett?
-They kicking our ass!

963
01:06:40,986 --> 01:06:43,226
You're getting pinned down,
staff sergeant!

964
01:06:43,427 --> 01:06:45,626
Marines, you're getting pinned down!

965
01:06:46,387 --> 01:06:48,786
-We're not leaving you.
-Staff sergeant, get them out!

966
01:06:48,987 --> 01:06:50,947
-Lieutenant, I am not leav--
-Get them out!

967
01:06:51,147 --> 01:06:53,107
-No, I'm not leaving you!
-Get them out!

968
01:06:53,308 --> 01:06:54,307
No! Not again!

969
01:06:57,348 --> 01:06:59,907
I have a bag of C-4 on the bus.

970
01:07:00,829 --> 01:07:02,787
Give this to my wife...

971
01:07:02,989 --> 01:07:05,588
...and get them off
this goddamn freeway.

972
01:07:09,229 --> 01:07:10,669
That's an order.

973
01:07:13,749 --> 01:07:15,269
Yes, sir.

974
01:07:18,271 --> 01:07:19,870
Right behind you.

975
01:07:27,791 --> 01:07:28,990
Cover the lieutenant!

976
01:07:32,072 --> 01:07:33,191
Hey, I'm out!

977
01:07:39,033 --> 01:07:40,632
They're closing in!

978
01:07:44,273 --> 01:07:45,312
Here we go.

979
01:07:51,074 --> 01:07:53,313
This is Lieutenant William Martinez...

980
01:07:53,515 --> 01:07:56,874
...Echo Company, 2nd Battalion,
5th Marines. Hoorah!

981
01:08:58,802 --> 01:09:01,721
We're still half a klick
inside the bombing zone.

982
01:09:04,042 --> 01:09:06,081
Move to live, Marines.

983
01:09:10,283 --> 01:09:13,282
Did he just leave the lieutenant
back there to die?

984
01:09:13,484 --> 01:09:15,083
Sure looked that way.

985
01:09:15,283 --> 01:09:17,763
And this is the guy
in charge of us now?

986
01:09:18,404 --> 01:09:19,843
Let's move.

987
01:09:22,765 --> 01:09:26,884
Hey, those are our jets.
We're still in the fight.

988
01:09:28,445 --> 01:09:31,005
All right, we're clear of the bomb zone.

989
01:09:31,485 --> 01:09:33,004
Let's tighten this place down.

990
01:09:33,206 --> 01:09:34,805
Bombs drop in six minutes.

991
01:09:35,006 --> 01:09:36,885
Santos, Kerns, on me.

992
01:09:37,086 --> 01:09:40,685
Let's see if there are any comms.
All right? Hardwire only.

993
01:09:59,208 --> 01:10:01,168
-Corporal Harris, we clear?
-We're clear!

994
01:10:01,368 --> 01:10:04,248
-Do you have a hard line in here?
-Over there.

995
01:10:08,369 --> 01:10:09,969
Now, my son's an optimist.

996
01:10:10,930 --> 01:10:15,089
When this first happened, he said,
"Why don't we go try to talk to them?

997
01:10:16,370 --> 01:10:18,330
Maybe they wanna be friends."

998
01:10:21,291 --> 01:10:23,050
Hector? Hey.

999
01:10:23,251 --> 01:10:26,251
We're gonna go get some food
and water for your dad, okay?

1000
01:10:26,891 --> 01:10:28,331
It's okay.

1001
01:10:29,252 --> 01:10:30,571
And what'd you tell him?

1002
01:10:30,772 --> 01:10:32,251
I said:

1003
01:10:32,853 --> 01:10:35,212
"You know, if they're chasing
and shooting us...

1004
01:10:35,412 --> 01:10:37,692
...they're probably not good friends."

1005
01:10:41,094 --> 01:10:44,012
I should've followed directions
and gone to the F.O.B.

1006
01:10:44,214 --> 01:10:47,533
I should've never stayed at the police
station, but I was scared, man.

1007
01:10:49,694 --> 01:10:51,654
I made all the wrong decisions.

1008
01:10:51,854 --> 01:10:54,014
You trusted your gut, Mr. Rincon.

1009
01:10:55,215 --> 01:10:56,974
You made a call.

1010
01:10:57,135 --> 01:10:59,814
I'd do the same thing
to protect my Marines.

1011
01:11:05,616 --> 01:11:08,776
-I had a situation my last tour.
-Yeah?

1012
01:11:09,936 --> 01:11:13,176
There was no right call. You went left
or you go right, it didn't matter.

1013
01:11:16,417 --> 01:11:17,936
But you're alive.

1014
01:11:18,138 --> 01:11:19,897
Yeah, I survived.

1015
01:11:22,098 --> 01:11:23,737
But I wasn't supposed to.

1016
01:11:26,138 --> 01:11:27,978
Staff Sergeant Nantz....

1017
01:11:36,500 --> 01:11:38,618
You promise to save my son?

1018
01:11:45,941 --> 01:11:48,740
Staff sergeant, we have
a hardwired connection!

1019
01:11:51,141 --> 01:11:54,020
Doc, keep him warm.
Sun is going down.

1020
01:11:54,982 --> 01:11:56,661
This will keep you warm.

1021
01:11:57,062 --> 01:12:01,182
We're estimating that 20 cities in 17
countries are now under full attack.

1022
01:12:01,503 --> 01:12:05,062
It's obvious the enemy is attempting
to cut us off from one another.

1023
01:12:05,263 --> 01:12:08,343
Is there any more information
at this time, Professor Stavert?

1024
01:12:08,543 --> 01:12:11,223
New data shows that they're using
our water as their fuel...

1025
01:12:11,383 --> 01:12:13,462
...and our ocean levels
are already decreasing.

1026
01:12:13,664 --> 01:12:16,463
They are using it to power their ships,
their machinery...

1027
01:12:16,664 --> 01:12:20,463
...possibly their own bodies. It's the
composition of our water that's unique.

1028
01:12:20,665 --> 01:12:23,904
It's in a liquid state. No other
locations in our known universe...

1029
01:12:24,105 --> 01:12:26,624
...have liquid H2O
anywhere near their surface.

1030
01:12:26,825 --> 01:12:30,305
I just saw a field report that said
they will use our sewage systems...

1031
01:12:30,506 --> 01:12:33,745
-...to follow our water to their ships.
-How'd you get that to work?

1032
01:12:33,906 --> 01:12:37,786
These things are everywhere. There's
one off the coast of 20 countries.

1033
01:12:37,987 --> 01:12:40,506
They're calling it
the command-and-control centre.

1034
01:12:41,587 --> 01:12:44,226
-That's the thing you were tracking?
-Yeah.

1035
01:12:44,428 --> 01:12:48,067
So you're saying that's the thing
that's controlling the drones?

1036
01:12:48,268 --> 01:12:52,707
Yeah. And if we wipe it out,
we take out their air power.

1037
01:12:55,269 --> 01:12:56,988
These bombs better work.

1038
01:12:57,189 --> 01:12:59,348
-Let's move it.
-Bring him through here.

1039
01:12:59,629 --> 01:13:02,468
-Set him down.
-How much time we got?

1040
01:13:03,229 --> 01:13:04,269
One minute.

1041
01:13:07,310 --> 01:13:10,549
Air Force about to lay some pain
on those extraterritorial bastards.

1042
01:13:13,511 --> 01:13:15,630
-All right, Two-Five, retreat....
-Hell!

1043
01:13:15,831 --> 01:13:17,670
-Retreat....
-Hell!

1044
01:13:19,151 --> 01:13:20,110
Here we go.

1045
01:13:20,271 --> 01:13:22,631
Come on.
Let's fry these sons of bitches.

1046
01:13:22,832 --> 01:13:25,271
We get to the F.O.B.
after these bombs drop, get ammo.

1047
01:13:25,432 --> 01:13:28,551
And some goddamn reinforcements.
Some goddamn tanks.

1048
01:13:33,432 --> 01:13:35,272
-Ten.
-Gotta be strong, okay?

1049
01:13:35,473 --> 01:13:36,872
Nine.

1050
01:13:37,073 --> 01:13:38,672
Eight.

1051
01:13:38,874 --> 01:13:40,113
Seven.

1052
01:13:40,313 --> 01:13:41,792
Six.

1053
01:13:41,994 --> 01:13:43,313
Five.

1054
01:13:43,874 --> 01:13:45,233
Four.

1055
01:13:46,234 --> 01:13:47,553
Three....

1056
01:13:48,674 --> 01:13:50,514
Shit. Everybody, brace!

1057
01:14:10,716 --> 01:14:12,516
-They should've dropped.
-What the hell?

1058
01:14:12,717 --> 01:14:16,236
Wouldn't we have felt that from here if
they'd dropped? We would've felt them.

1059
01:14:16,438 --> 01:14:18,557
Would've felt it in Nevada
with that ordnance.

1060
01:14:18,758 --> 01:14:20,197
That clock right?

1061
01:14:20,398 --> 01:14:21,597
That's what I got.

1062
01:14:21,799 --> 01:14:24,958
Maybe it's a good thing. Maybe we
turned the tide. That's a good thing.

1063
01:14:25,118 --> 01:14:27,438
You damn straight, Imlay.
We was kicking some ass.

1064
01:14:27,639 --> 01:14:30,198
Could they have taken out
the whole Air Force?

1065
01:14:30,399 --> 01:14:32,038
This isn't happening.

1066
01:14:32,240 --> 01:14:33,319
Let's move.

1067
01:14:33,519 --> 01:14:35,519
Everybody, up, up. Let's move.
Come on.

1068
01:14:35,720 --> 01:14:38,439
We're in the home stretch, everybody.
We in the home stretch.

1069
01:14:55,682 --> 01:14:58,201
Now we know why
those bombs didn't drop.

1070
01:14:58,762 --> 01:15:01,962
They wiped our forward
operating base right off the map.

1071
01:15:03,643 --> 01:15:05,762
All clear, staff sergeant!

1072
01:15:06,003 --> 01:15:08,602
All right, let's bring him back here.

1073
01:15:12,644 --> 01:15:13,643
Hang in there, buddy.

1074
01:15:13,844 --> 01:15:16,323
Million-and-one odds
we'd get here in the first place...

1075
01:15:16,525 --> 01:15:20,604
...we get here and there ain't nothing.
I knew Nantz would never get us out.

1076
01:15:22,565 --> 01:15:26,405
-There were thousands of Marines here.
-Now it's just seven of us, Imlay.

1077
01:15:28,085 --> 01:15:30,285
You remind me of my older brother.

1078
01:15:31,046 --> 01:15:32,765
How's that?

1079
01:15:33,407 --> 01:15:35,686
He never smiles either.

1080
01:15:39,007 --> 01:15:40,486
Secure the front with Harris.

1081
01:15:42,407 --> 01:15:43,846
Imlay, anything?

1082
01:15:44,047 --> 01:15:46,007
Nothing.
We only got maps of Santa Monica.

1083
01:15:46,207 --> 01:15:48,687
We need something farther east.
They're all burned.

1084
01:15:48,888 --> 01:15:49,927
Follow me, Imlay.

1085
01:15:54,688 --> 01:15:57,408
All right, here's the
battalion commander's hooch.

1086
01:15:57,569 --> 01:15:59,888
Looking for maps,
anything with an extraction point.

1087
01:16:00,049 --> 01:16:01,769
Staff sergeant.

1088
01:16:10,691 --> 01:16:12,409
I'll be right back.

1089
01:16:18,491 --> 01:16:20,490
Found a tactical map, staff sergeant.

1090
01:16:20,651 --> 01:16:22,971
Shows where all the units
were deployed.

1091
01:16:23,532 --> 01:16:26,492
-What the hell are all these red marks?
-Means they're gone.

1092
01:16:26,692 --> 01:16:29,612
-You mean the units got moved?
-Wiped out.

1093
01:16:30,212 --> 01:16:32,531
-All of them?
-All of them.

1094
01:16:32,733 --> 01:16:33,932
Oh, shit.

1095
01:16:34,133 --> 01:16:38,093
All right. One alternate extraction site
is still operational.

1096
01:16:38,814 --> 01:16:40,453
That's eight klicks.

1097
01:16:40,654 --> 01:16:44,294
Staff sergeant? Staff sergeant.

1098
01:16:45,174 --> 01:16:47,854
Adukwu, plenty of weapons around.
Find yourself an M-16.

1099
01:16:48,255 --> 01:16:49,534
Mr. Rincon is dead.

1100
01:17:13,218 --> 01:17:14,776
Wake up, Dad.

1101
01:17:22,699 --> 01:17:25,258
Please help me right now.

1102
01:17:27,099 --> 01:17:28,778
Don't leave me.

1103
01:17:34,100 --> 01:17:36,379
I'm so sorry, Hector.

1104
01:17:40,300 --> 01:17:41,700
I'm sorry.

1105
01:17:42,741 --> 01:17:43,820
No.

1106
01:17:43,981 --> 01:17:47,661
Your dad tried so hard
to stay with you.

1107
01:17:49,101 --> 01:17:51,260
-I'm sorr--
-I don't wanna be here.

1108
01:17:57,943 --> 01:17:59,542
It's okay, bud.

1109
01:18:06,424 --> 01:18:09,183
Your father was a brave man, Hector.

1110
01:18:18,065 --> 01:18:22,424
Hector, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, buddy.

1111
01:18:22,625 --> 01:18:24,624
It's okay to cry.

1112
01:18:29,666 --> 01:18:31,826
He loved you very much.

1113
01:18:32,866 --> 01:18:34,706
Listen to me, Hector.

1114
01:18:36,307 --> 01:18:40,187
I need you to be brave for me.
I need you to be my little Marine.

1115
01:18:43,188 --> 01:18:44,507
Okay?

1116
01:18:46,388 --> 01:18:48,588
We gotta be brave for the others.

1117
01:18:51,309 --> 01:18:52,867
Do you know why?

1118
01:18:54,749 --> 01:18:56,188
Why?

1119
01:18:59,150 --> 01:19:01,589
Because Marines don't quit.

1120
01:19:03,670 --> 01:19:05,069
Do you believe that?

1121
01:19:07,511 --> 01:19:08,669
Say it for me.

1122
01:19:11,671 --> 01:19:15,110
-Marines don't quit.
-Good.

1123
01:19:15,631 --> 01:19:19,470
I'm gonna get you out of here, Hector.
I promise.

1124
01:19:22,952 --> 01:19:25,592
Let's go see the girls, okay? Come on.

1125
01:19:42,834 --> 01:19:46,114
We are not losing one more
of those civilians. Understand?

1126
01:19:48,315 --> 01:19:51,034
You getting us out too, staff sergeant?

1127
01:19:53,115 --> 01:19:54,755
Or are we expendable?

1128
01:20:04,157 --> 01:20:05,836
All right, Lockett.

1129
01:20:06,637 --> 01:20:08,797
You wanna go there, let's go there.

1130
01:20:12,918 --> 01:20:15,517
I commanded men and men died.

1131
01:20:15,758 --> 01:20:20,237
Kids. 19 years old.
The best men I ever led.

1132
01:20:20,959 --> 01:20:25,598
Do you think for one second I wouldn't
rather trade places with them?

1133
01:20:31,599 --> 01:20:34,239
I know you think I got my men killed.

1134
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:38,440
They're dead.

1135
01:20:40,001 --> 01:20:41,440
I'm here.

1136
01:20:42,241 --> 01:20:44,640
Like the punch line to some bad joke.

1137
01:20:44,882 --> 01:20:46,720
You think I like that?

1138
01:20:47,042 --> 01:20:50,201
Do you think a minute goes by
that those faces aren't right here...

1139
01:20:50,402 --> 01:20:52,481
...seared into my brain?

1140
01:20:55,683 --> 01:21:00,002
Dante, Thomas T. Corporal.
1-5-6-5-0-9-3-8-6.

1141
01:21:00,163 --> 01:21:05,603
Ambruster, William R. Private.
8-7-6-6-6-2-3-5-4.

1142
01:21:06,284 --> 01:21:08,723
Wharton, Jeffrey H.

1143
01:21:08,924 --> 01:21:13,764
Lance Corporal. 8-7-4-2-7-3-9-9-3.

1144
01:21:17,525 --> 01:21:19,004
Lockett...

1145
01:21:21,845 --> 01:21:24,725
...Duane G.

1146
01:21:26,326 --> 01:21:27,885
Corporal.

1147
01:21:29,447 --> 01:21:33,926
1-5-6-8-7-0-9....

1148
01:21:34,247 --> 01:21:35,966
Five-five.

1149
01:21:37,968 --> 01:21:40,606
Your brother
was an outstanding Marine.

1150
01:21:43,168 --> 01:21:44,288
He was my friend.

1151
01:21:45,368 --> 01:21:50,048
And I miss him every day.

1152
01:21:52,969 --> 01:21:54,408
And you remind me of him.

1153
01:22:03,370 --> 01:22:05,449
None of that matters right now.

1154
01:22:07,210 --> 01:22:10,970
Because our duty is to keep
moving forwards, to keep fighting.

1155
01:22:12,091 --> 01:22:13,731
That's how we honour your brother...

1156
01:22:14,331 --> 01:22:16,010
...and Lieutenant Martinez...

1157
01:22:16,251 --> 01:22:18,170
...Corporal Stavrou...

1158
01:22:18,372 --> 01:22:20,291
...Lance Corporal Mottola...

1159
01:22:21,132 --> 01:22:22,211
...Hector's father...

1160
01:22:23,052 --> 01:22:26,252
...who picked up a rifle and did what
needed to be done. A civilian.

1161
01:22:26,453 --> 01:22:28,732
So we better damn well step it up.

1162
01:22:28,933 --> 01:22:30,893
Discard any lingering doubt.

1163
01:22:31,454 --> 01:22:33,933
Work fast, work as a unit,
and we will prevail.

1164
01:22:34,174 --> 01:22:36,333
Let's figure out
how we're gonna get out of this.

1165
01:22:36,574 --> 01:22:38,573
Imlay, you come with me.
Get to higher ground.

1166
01:22:38,814 --> 01:22:41,253
The rest of you, find some ammo
and some vehicles.

1167
01:22:41,455 --> 01:22:44,814
Gotta be a few LAV's or armoured
Humvees still operational.

1168
01:22:45,655 --> 01:22:48,735
Sorry, bro. You didn't deserve this.

1169
01:22:52,016 --> 01:22:54,215
You went down fighting.

1170
01:23:00,337 --> 01:23:01,736
Holy shit.

1171
01:23:01,936 --> 01:23:03,856
I wasn't expecting to see all this.

1172
01:23:05,457 --> 01:23:07,056
That don't look good.

1173
01:23:07,297 --> 01:23:08,497
Reinforcements.

1174
01:23:12,618 --> 01:23:14,658
Holy shit.

1175
01:23:16,338 --> 01:23:18,498
They already set up a beachhead.

1176
01:23:19,379 --> 01:23:20,618
All right.

1177
01:23:22,179 --> 01:23:26,179
If that evac site is still operational,
I think we can get behind the line.

1178
01:23:26,379 --> 01:23:28,179
That's gonna be one hell of a ride.

1179
01:23:28,419 --> 01:23:30,259
Yeah, well, that's what we get paid for.

1180
01:23:30,420 --> 01:23:33,899
Everybody move to the LAV now! Go!

1181
01:23:34,101 --> 01:23:36,499
Any station, this net.
This is Foxtrot-Two-November.

1182
01:23:36,660 --> 01:23:37,780
We have 11 passengers.

1183
01:23:38,021 --> 01:23:42,101
Requesting evacuation at alternate
extraction point Charlie.

1184
01:23:42,301 --> 01:23:44,220
Are there any birds in the air? Over.

1185
01:23:44,422 --> 01:23:48,061
Foxtrot-Two-November, this is
Sierra 2-5. Orders are to pull back.

1186
01:23:48,262 --> 01:23:52,181
Get to extraction point Charlie
by 0300 or we'll be gone. Over.

1187
01:23:52,383 --> 01:23:55,222
Roger that. 0300, not a minute more.
Out.

1188
01:23:57,223 --> 01:23:59,503
Imlay, ever see what
a Bushmaster chain gun can do?

1189
01:23:59,703 --> 01:24:02,063
-Oh, shit, yes, staff sergeant.
-Get on it, son.

1190
01:24:02,264 --> 01:24:04,183
Let's do this!

1191
01:24:08,025 --> 01:24:09,463
-No lights, Kerns.
-Roger that.

1192
01:24:10,424 --> 01:24:11,984
Let's move.

1193
01:24:15,065 --> 01:24:16,624
Bushmaster is locked and loaded.

1194
01:24:16,825 --> 01:24:18,025
Give them hell.

1195
01:24:18,225 --> 01:24:19,665
Damn right.

1196
01:24:30,747 --> 01:24:32,826
Two minutes till that helo drops.

1197
01:24:35,387 --> 01:24:37,067
Everybody okay?

1198
01:24:39,948 --> 01:24:42,907
All right, Kerns, take a left.

1199
01:24:43,068 --> 01:24:46,187
I want you to go over three blocks,
then you go about five blocks...

1200
01:24:46,389 --> 01:24:48,188
...hang a right, and straight.

1201
01:24:48,429 --> 01:24:51,148
-That should get us to the evac site.
-Yes, staff sergeant.

1202
01:24:53,150 --> 01:24:56,829
-I'd hold on if I were you, Lockett!
-Copy that!

1203
01:24:58,590 --> 01:25:00,349
-We got hostiles.
-What's going on?

1204
01:25:00,551 --> 01:25:03,390
-Let's not wait around and find out.
-It's gonna be okay.

1205
01:25:03,551 --> 01:25:06,270
Got about 250 rounds, staff sergeant.

1206
01:25:14,031 --> 01:25:15,711
Know what they say if you hit a deer?

1207
01:25:15,952 --> 01:25:17,631
-Speed up!
-Damn straight!

1208
01:25:23,072 --> 01:25:24,592
-Come on!
-Y'all hold on!

1209
01:25:24,793 --> 01:25:27,232
We're gonna have to go
right through them!

1210
01:25:32,393 --> 01:25:35,073
-You saw that?
-They're going down like bowling pins!

1211
01:25:58,517 --> 01:25:59,996
Kick it out!

1212
01:26:00,317 --> 01:26:02,876
Run that sucker over, man!

1213
01:26:05,118 --> 01:26:06,197
Santos, you okay?

1214
01:26:06,997 --> 01:26:09,757
I got that nasty stuff
all over my mouth, man!

1215
01:26:12,198 --> 01:26:15,877
-It's not funny.
-You let him do you on the first date.

1216
01:26:29,161 --> 01:26:31,720
-Everyone okay?
-Yes!

1217
01:26:33,040 --> 01:26:34,200
Let's get us home.

1218
01:26:40,361 --> 01:26:42,281
Cease fire!

1219
01:26:46,723 --> 01:26:49,002
-Stay close, stay close!
-What are we doing?

1220
01:26:52,523 --> 01:26:55,802
Load them up! Our flight path
won't be clear much longer!

1221
01:26:56,003 --> 01:26:57,882
You're in the middle of the shit,
sergeant!

1222
01:26:58,043 --> 01:26:59,443
What happened to all our air?

1223
01:26:59,643 --> 01:27:02,843
Pulled back to save our assets!
They were blowing us out!

1224
01:27:03,044 --> 01:27:04,643
We're abandoning Los Angeles!

1225
01:27:14,085 --> 01:27:16,004
Let's go, Imlay!

1226
01:27:16,326 --> 01:27:17,965
Son, you okay?

1227
01:27:19,766 --> 01:27:21,085
All right.

1228
01:27:22,446 --> 01:27:24,765
Let's move! Move, move!

1229
01:27:25,846 --> 01:27:27,846
Come on, Harris, let's go!

1230
01:28:08,131 --> 01:28:09,531
Hold on!

1231
01:28:12,372 --> 01:28:13,931
-You all right?
-Everybody all good?

1232
01:28:14,132 --> 01:28:16,291
-Girls?
-Everybody okay?

1233
01:28:16,492 --> 01:28:18,052
Hold on tight!

1234
01:28:19,813 --> 01:28:20,971
What happened?

1235
01:28:21,173 --> 01:28:24,292
Pilot said something
was playing hell with our power!

1236
01:28:24,493 --> 01:28:27,732
Staff sergeant! Nine o'clock!

1237
01:28:33,414 --> 01:28:36,453
Santos, you said you were tracking
massive RF signals?

1238
01:28:36,654 --> 01:28:39,134
Could a concentration of them
knock out power?

1239
01:28:41,175 --> 01:28:43,054
Yes, definitely! Why?

1240
01:28:43,416 --> 01:28:45,694
Could be their
command-and-control centre!

1241
01:28:48,896 --> 01:28:50,335
Get me down there!

1242
01:28:50,536 --> 01:28:51,895
What?

1243
01:28:52,976 --> 01:28:55,176
I gotta recon that area!

1244
01:28:55,377 --> 01:28:57,575
No way! It's a suicide!

1245
01:28:57,777 --> 01:29:01,377
Damn it, we're the only ones left!
All the other forces have fallen back!

1246
01:29:01,577 --> 01:29:05,977
We can't land! May not have power
to take off again!

1247
01:29:13,059 --> 01:29:15,338
This is a letter for Martinez's wife.

1248
01:29:16,659 --> 01:29:18,139
Will you get it to her?

1249
01:29:21,339 --> 01:29:22,659
Yeah.

1250
01:29:27,820 --> 01:29:30,379
Hover at 40 feet!

1251
01:29:30,861 --> 01:29:32,220
-Twenty seconds!
-Roger that!

1252
01:29:36,581 --> 01:29:38,941
Come on, Adukwu, let's get this off.

1253
01:29:39,141 --> 01:29:41,261
Staff sergeant, what the hell
are you doing?

1254
01:29:41,462 --> 01:29:44,342
We're in the clear!
We're almost home, Imlay!

1255
01:29:44,542 --> 01:29:46,541
You're in charge now!

1256
01:29:47,382 --> 01:29:49,942
You get these civilians home safe!

1257
01:29:54,064 --> 01:29:56,342
You're the bravest Marine I ever seen,
Hector!

1258
01:29:57,704 --> 01:29:59,183
No!

1259
01:30:41,349 --> 01:30:43,308
Everybody, take cover.

1260
01:30:46,229 --> 01:30:47,668
I told you to stay in that helo.

1261
01:30:47,869 --> 01:30:51,229
Civilians are free and clear.
We were worried about your ass.

1262
01:30:51,589 --> 01:30:53,709
I think the command-and-control asset
is nearby.

1263
01:30:54,270 --> 01:30:56,309
Kerns, how many klicks
to that blackout?

1264
01:30:56,751 --> 01:30:58,869
It's about five klicks, staff sergeant.

1265
01:30:59,071 --> 01:31:00,469
Five klicks. All right.

1266
01:31:01,030 --> 01:31:03,070
We're gonna use this overpass
for cover.

1267
01:31:04,311 --> 01:31:05,671
If we take out those drones...

1268
01:31:05,871 --> 01:31:09,231
...our military might have a chance
to get back into this fight.

1269
01:31:09,632 --> 01:31:11,151
Santos...

1270
01:31:11,552 --> 01:31:15,071
...where would you put a command and
control asset if you wanted to protect it?

1271
01:31:16,313 --> 01:31:17,992
-Underground.
-Let's go.

1272
01:31:19,593 --> 01:31:22,592
Everybody, let's move. Come on.
Move, move, move.

1273
01:31:47,036 --> 01:31:48,035
Move.

1274
01:32:40,242 --> 01:32:42,881
They must've gone back up.
Just leads up to the street.

1275
01:32:43,082 --> 01:32:46,042
I thought they were leading us
to the command-and-control centre.

1276
01:32:46,483 --> 01:32:47,882
Damn it.

1277
01:32:52,043 --> 01:32:54,123
Let's go. Back.

1278
01:33:02,404 --> 01:33:04,644
Holy shit!

1279
01:33:05,205 --> 01:33:07,244
Santos!

1280
01:33:22,007 --> 01:33:23,805
They know we're here now.

1281
01:33:33,968 --> 01:33:36,128
That's their command-and-control.

1282
01:33:41,409 --> 01:33:44,089
Everybody out now!
Move, move, move! Follow me!

1283
01:33:44,569 --> 01:33:48,129
Up here! Up that ladder, go!
Move, move, move! Up that ladder!

1284
01:33:48,929 --> 01:33:51,129
Let's go! Move it up!
Blow that grate, Imlay!

1285
01:33:52,490 --> 01:33:53,649
Move, move, move!

1286
01:34:00,171 --> 01:34:01,850
We're right over their command asset.

1287
01:34:02,332 --> 01:34:06,890
That's it, all right. Let's move the
concrete slab, 1 o'clock. Let's move.

1288
01:34:08,972 --> 01:34:10,171
Fire in the hole!

1289
01:34:10,372 --> 01:34:12,612
That should give us a couple minutes.

1290
01:34:28,255 --> 01:34:31,214
Laser target, staff sergeant?
We don't have any more jets, though.

1291
01:34:31,415 --> 01:34:34,414
They can fire ground-to-ground
missiles from Edwards Air Force Base.

1292
01:34:34,574 --> 01:34:36,974
We radio in a strike,
paint the target with the laser.

1293
01:34:37,176 --> 01:34:38,774
-Aye-aye, staff sergeant.
-Hoorah.

1294
01:34:38,975 --> 01:34:41,895
Our best chance at radio reception
is on top of that building...

1295
01:34:42,056 --> 01:34:43,415
...but it's the most exposed.

1296
01:34:43,616 --> 01:34:45,975
I'll do it, staff sergeant.
I'll make the call.

1297
01:34:46,176 --> 01:34:47,576
Santos, you got those codes?

1298
01:34:47,776 --> 01:34:49,736
Air Force strike package coming up.

1299
01:34:51,257 --> 01:34:54,336
You get to high ground. Once you
radio in, they'll track that signal.

1300
01:34:54,537 --> 01:34:56,016
Things are gonna get real hot.

1301
01:34:56,218 --> 01:34:59,416
So once you make that call,
you get the hell out of there, all right?

1302
01:34:59,938 --> 01:35:01,056
You know what that means?

1303
01:35:01,258 --> 01:35:04,297
We're gonna have to hold those
things off till the strike gets here.

1304
01:35:04,498 --> 01:35:06,417
Bingo. Marines...

1305
01:35:07,818 --> 01:35:11,858
...we make our stand here. Let those
bastards know who they're fucking with.

1306
01:35:12,059 --> 01:35:13,058
-Retreat....
-Hell!

1307
01:35:13,259 --> 01:35:14,658
Two-Five.

1308
01:35:25,060 --> 01:35:27,300
-Right of the heart, right?
-Right of the heart.

1309
01:35:27,821 --> 01:35:29,981
They're gonna be coming up
from there. Take two.

1310
01:35:30,181 --> 01:35:32,460
Plant one there and the other one
on the other side.

1311
01:35:32,661 --> 01:35:35,181
-Keep your head down, get it done.
-Doc, watch your back!

1312
01:35:35,382 --> 01:35:37,421
Watch your head! Watch it!

1313
01:35:45,063 --> 01:35:53,462
Any station, this is
Foxtrot-Two-November, do you copy?

1314
01:35:53,664 --> 01:35:55,823
Foxtrot-Two-November,
this is Yankee-Tango, over.

1315
01:35:56,024 --> 01:35:59,383
We have a priority fire mission. We've
located an enemy command centre...

1316
01:35:59,624 --> 01:36:02,944
...under grid 885-342.

1317
01:36:03,145 --> 01:36:05,944
We will be lasing. Code 1-2-0.

1318
01:36:06,145 --> 01:36:08,465
I say again, we will be lasing.
Code 1-2-0.

1319
01:36:08,665 --> 01:36:11,105
Copy that.
Time to target, three minutes.

1320
01:36:13,026 --> 01:36:14,025
Staff sergeant!

1321
01:36:14,786 --> 01:36:17,946
We got three minutes!
It's coming in three minutes!

1322
01:36:18,146 --> 01:36:20,866
All right. Let's paint this target.

1323
01:36:32,148 --> 01:36:34,428
Hell of a shot, Kerns!
Get your ass out of there!

1324
01:36:36,148 --> 01:36:38,508
Get out of there, Kerns! Shit.

1325
01:36:42,349 --> 01:36:44,228
-Shit!
-Kerns!

1326
01:36:47,069 --> 01:36:49,429
Shit! Shit!

1327
01:36:53,591 --> 01:36:56,230
Doc, Doc! Get to cover now!
Move, move!

1328
01:36:56,431 --> 01:36:57,950
Shit.

1329
01:37:00,951 --> 01:37:02,631
Contact! Twelve o'clock!

1330
01:37:03,512 --> 01:37:05,231
Covering up front!

1331
01:37:05,432 --> 01:37:07,351
-Go, go, go!
-Go on, get in there!

1332
01:37:09,032 --> 01:37:10,752
Shift fire left! Shift fire left!

1333
01:37:11,873 --> 01:37:13,352
Right there, right there!

1334
01:37:18,753 --> 01:37:20,032
Got it!

1335
01:37:20,874 --> 01:37:22,633
Sixty seconds left.

1336
01:37:32,035 --> 01:37:34,434
-Lockett!
-Shit!

1337
01:37:37,875 --> 01:37:39,235
Let's go!

1338
01:37:46,476 --> 01:37:48,556
Back in the fight, Santos!

1339
01:37:49,317 --> 01:37:51,076
-Need a little help!
-Covering!

1340
01:37:51,277 --> 01:37:53,236
Imlay, use your grenade launcher!

1341
01:37:53,438 --> 01:37:55,516
-I got it, Doc!
-Covering!

1342
01:38:03,358 --> 01:38:05,918
Where's that goddamn artillery?
Should've hit by now.

1343
01:38:07,359 --> 01:38:09,038
Doc, let's go!

1344
01:38:12,439 --> 01:38:14,759
-Doc?
-Imlay! Imlay!

1345
01:38:23,161 --> 01:38:24,800
Incoming!

1346
01:38:29,961 --> 01:38:31,241
Yes!

1347
01:38:32,041 --> 01:38:34,600
Santos, we got it! We got it!

1348
01:38:36,402 --> 01:38:39,321
Direct hit! Direct hit!

1349
01:38:39,483 --> 01:38:40,722
Staff sergeant, you did it!

1350
01:38:44,123 --> 01:38:45,362
Yes, we got it!

1351
01:38:45,844 --> 01:38:48,242
The strike package. It went through?

1352
01:38:48,844 --> 01:38:51,123
-It came through?
-Yeah! All right, Kerns!

1353
01:38:52,244 --> 01:38:53,603
It's over.

1354
01:39:10,006 --> 01:39:11,565
It's coming up. It's coming up.

1355
01:39:23,288 --> 01:39:25,646
They're trying to get away.

1356
01:39:30,448 --> 01:39:33,648
The goddamn thing can fly,
staff sergeant. It's flying now!

1357
01:39:33,849 --> 01:39:34,967
I'll get you out!

1358
01:39:42,809 --> 01:39:45,289
We gotta protect the laser.
Come on. Come on!

1359
01:39:47,130 --> 01:39:48,609
Santos!

1360
01:39:58,491 --> 01:39:59,930
Son of a bitch!

1361
01:40:02,372 --> 01:40:05,211
-That hurt!
-Cover me, Lockett!

1362
01:40:10,372 --> 01:40:13,612
The drones are pulling it away!
We gotta take it out now!

1363
01:40:17,093 --> 01:40:19,293
Incoming Copperhead!

1364
01:40:23,814 --> 01:40:26,533
They're using the drone
to protect the ship!

1365
01:40:29,935 --> 01:40:31,614
I'm running low on ammo!

1366
01:40:31,815 --> 01:40:33,174
Santos!

1367
01:40:37,296 --> 01:40:40,215
-How is he?
-He's hanging in there, staff sergeant!

1368
01:40:40,416 --> 01:40:42,455
Crazy bastard.
You should've left me there.

1369
01:40:46,937 --> 01:40:48,376
Covering!

1370
01:40:49,257 --> 01:40:50,416
Grenade!

1371
01:40:56,938 --> 01:40:59,337
-Staff sergeant!
-We are not dying here, Lockett!

1372
01:40:59,578 --> 01:41:01,537
You damn right we're not dying!

1373
01:41:02,979 --> 01:41:05,138
It's getting out of range!
I gotta take it down!

1374
01:41:05,338 --> 01:41:07,258
Doesn't have enough punch!
Save that shot!

1375
01:41:16,460 --> 01:41:18,179
Staff sergeant!

1376
01:41:18,380 --> 01:41:19,619
Lockett, you okay?

1377
01:41:19,821 --> 01:41:21,700
Harris, you're gonna be okay.

1378
01:41:45,104 --> 01:41:47,342
There's the last Copperhead.

1379
01:41:51,024 --> 01:41:53,543
Santos, take out that drone!

1380
01:41:55,824 --> 01:41:57,504
Firing!

1381
01:42:13,747 --> 01:42:15,226
-Yeah!
-We did it!

1382
01:42:17,347 --> 01:42:21,106
We did it!

1383
01:42:26,228 --> 01:42:28,988
I can't believe it worked!

1384
01:42:34,869 --> 01:42:36,508
Yeah!

1385
01:42:36,709 --> 01:42:38,268
Staff sergeant, you did it!

1386
01:42:40,470 --> 01:42:43,349
There's nothing controlling
the drones anymore!

1387
01:42:49,671 --> 01:42:51,430
Marines, on me!

1388
01:43:03,392 --> 01:43:05,791
They're retreating. Advance!

1389
01:44:13,560 --> 01:44:15,359
You guys saved our lives out there!

1390
01:44:15,561 --> 01:44:17,359
Semper Fi, Two-Five!

1391
01:44:17,601 --> 01:44:20,840
-All right, Two-Five!
-Retreat, hell!

1392
01:44:21,041 --> 01:44:23,600
You kicked ass, staff sarge!
Welcome home!

1393
01:44:24,482 --> 01:44:27,601
-Move! Move! Move!
-Good work, Marines! Outstanding.

1394
01:44:28,162 --> 01:44:29,961
Your civilians are safe.

1395
01:44:30,162 --> 01:44:32,641
Word of how you brought
their ship down...

1396
01:44:32,802 --> 01:44:35,402
...is going out to every army
in every city.

1397
01:44:35,602 --> 01:44:39,442
We're mustering up whatever troops
we can get and going back in.

1398
01:44:39,683 --> 01:44:41,642
So get out of that gear.

1399
01:44:42,203 --> 01:44:43,363
Get some chow in you.

1400
01:44:43,804 --> 01:44:45,603
There's breakfast in the tent.

1401
01:44:45,804 --> 01:44:49,083
You earned it. Hoorah, Two-Five.

1402
01:45:35,569 --> 01:45:37,009
-Get some smoke, Imlay.
-Got you.

1403
01:45:37,209 --> 01:45:39,329
Got grenades over here.
Anybody need?

1404
01:45:39,529 --> 01:45:43,569
-Got frag rounds coming down.
-Imlay, I think you could use this.

1405
01:45:43,770 --> 01:45:46,570
-Got it. HE rounds.
-I need a couple more magazines.

1406
01:45:46,771 --> 01:45:48,930
-Very nice, very nice.
-Everybody got ammo?

1407
01:45:49,130 --> 01:45:50,530
Yes, staff sergeant.

1408
01:45:50,931 --> 01:45:53,331
What do you think you're doing,
staff sergeant?

1409
01:45:54,091 --> 01:45:56,250
We already had breakfast, sir.

1410
01:46:04,973 --> 01:46:06,732
I'll be borrowing this, sir.

1411
01:46:06,973 --> 01:46:08,332
Carry on.

1412
01:46:09,414 --> 01:46:11,372
-Retreat, hell!
-Hoorah!

1413
01:46:12,493 --> 01:46:14,413
This is Bullpen 2-3. Who's with me?

1414
01:46:14,653 --> 01:46:16,813
Morning, Bullpen.
Dog Pound 2-1, on your left.

1415
01:46:16,974 --> 01:46:18,933
Good to hear a friendly voice,
Dog Pound 2-1.

1416
01:46:19,094 --> 01:46:20,973
Liberty 1-1,
Snake Eyes joining the fight.

1417
01:46:21,134 --> 01:46:22,814
Yankee-Foxtrot-2-1,
we're on your six.

1418
01:46:22,975 --> 01:46:24,974
-Morning, Dog Pound 2-1.
-Eagle on your right.

1419
01:46:25,135 --> 01:47:29,255
This is Foxtrot-Two-November.
Let's take back Los Angeles.
