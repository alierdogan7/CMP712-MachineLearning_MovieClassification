1
00:00:21,274 --> 00:00:22,673
<i>Hit it!</i>

2
00:00:24,144 --> 00:00:25,475
<i>Come on, yeah, dance</i>

3
00:00:36,556 --> 00:00:38,456
Cute and cuddly, boys.

4
00:00:53,540 --> 00:00:55,531
All right. So why are we here?

5
00:00:55,675 --> 00:00:59,634
The question that has vexed
common man and philosopher alike.

6
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:02,179
That's not what you're going for, is it?

7
00:01:02,315 --> 00:01:04,909
Maurice said he's got
a very important announcement.

8
00:01:05,051 --> 00:01:07,519
All right,
might I have everyone's attention?

9
00:01:07,654 --> 00:01:09,349
Everyone, eyes and ears!

10
00:01:10,657 --> 00:01:12,887
Hello? Is anyone listening?

11
00:01:13,026 --> 00:01:14,459
Quiet!

12
00:01:16,863 --> 00:01:18,160
Thank you.

13
00:01:18,298 --> 00:01:21,233
It is my honour
to introduce King Julien,

14
00:01:21,367 --> 00:01:23,858
leader of lemurs,
lord of the ringtails,

15
00:01:24,003 --> 00:01:26,972
et cetera, et cetera, et cetera!

16
00:01:36,883 --> 00:01:39,977
Thank you, Maurice,
for your hearty "et caters. "

17
00:01:40,119 --> 00:01:41,586
I will cut to the chases.

18
00:01:41,721 --> 00:01:45,555
In a few hours, we celebrate
the biggest holiday of the year.

19
00:01:45,692 --> 00:01:48,126
Christmas in July!

20
00:01:48,261 --> 00:01:50,559
Except not Christmas,

21
00:01:50,697 --> 00:01:52,324
and it's not July.

22
00:01:52,465 --> 00:01:55,332
Look how playfully
they tease me, Maurice.

23
00:01:55,468 --> 00:01:58,801
You know I am speaking
of King Julien Day.

24
00:01:58,938 --> 00:02:01,532
How could you not?
It's on every calendar.

25
00:02:02,642 --> 00:02:03,836
What about this one?

26
00:02:04,611 --> 00:02:05,600
Maurice?

27
00:02:08,514 --> 00:02:09,913
There it is. See?

28
00:02:10,049 --> 00:02:12,779
So shut up and start shopping.

29
00:02:15,989 --> 00:02:18,355
So, what is King Julien Day?

30
00:02:18,491 --> 00:02:21,824
On King Julien Day,
everybody loads up the gifts on the king

31
00:02:21,961 --> 00:02:26,159
and pretty much does whatever he says.
It's eight kinds of fun.

32
00:02:26,299 --> 00:02:28,767
- No lie.
- I see.

33
00:02:28,902 --> 00:02:31,200
Well, in that case, pass.

34
00:02:31,337 --> 00:02:34,272
Listen to me. You don't
understand this here situation.

35
00:02:34,407 --> 00:02:37,171
You want King Julien
to be happy on his holiday.

36
00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:40,279
One time, everyone forgot
about King Julien Day, I tell you.

37
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:44,174
Which forgetter is next
for their whooping?

38
00:02:44,317 --> 00:02:48,720
Come on! I want you to hurt like I do!

39
00:02:51,424 --> 00:02:53,153
I couldn't sit right for a week.

40
00:02:53,293 --> 00:02:56,353
Trust me, you do not
want him to freak on you.

41
00:02:56,496 --> 00:02:58,464
We'll take our chances.

42
00:02:58,598 --> 00:03:02,261
Please! King Julien Day
is my favourite holiday

43
00:03:02,402 --> 00:03:05,530
in the whole wide world!
I love it this much!

44
00:03:05,672 --> 00:03:08,232
That's a whole lot of love
relative to body mass.

45
00:03:09,809 --> 00:03:12,209
Does anyone remember
that kid's birthday party last week?

46
00:03:13,246 --> 00:03:16,147
Yes. Poor little chap's party
got rained out.

47
00:03:16,282 --> 00:03:19,911
Well, when the humans ran for cover,
Mort and I snatched this.

48
00:03:20,954 --> 00:03:23,980
Do you know what the people
put in these things?

49
00:03:24,123 --> 00:03:25,715
Candy! Lots of it!

50
00:03:25,858 --> 00:03:27,689
The forbidden fruit-flavoured food?

51
00:03:27,827 --> 00:03:31,888
I crack it open on my belly
and dig out the creamy centre.

52
00:03:34,367 --> 00:03:38,326
That's right. This pinata
is full of sweet deliciousness.

53
00:03:43,076 --> 00:03:44,304
What have we here?

54
00:03:48,648 --> 00:03:51,310
Lots more where this came from.
It'll all be yours

55
00:03:51,451 --> 00:03:54,318
if you all just celebrate
King Julien Day like you mean it.

56
00:03:59,759 --> 00:04:01,556
Happy Me Day!

57
00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:07,889
Maurice thinks he can bribe us
with his pinata promises.

58
00:04:08,034 --> 00:04:10,935
Sadly for him,
penguins are not for sale. Right, men?

59
00:04:11,070 --> 00:04:12,697
What all do you think is in there?

60
00:04:12,839 --> 00:04:15,399
I think there are
butterscotch lollies and sourballs.

61
00:04:15,541 --> 00:04:19,409
I'd say we're looking at a 50/50 mixture
of gummy fish and candy buttons.

62
00:04:19,545 --> 00:04:21,911
- Buttons!
- We may never know,

63
00:04:22,048 --> 00:04:25,745
'cause today we're performing
scheduled maintenance on the HQ.

64
00:04:25,885 --> 00:04:28,581
- Perhaps we could postpone?
- Negative.

65
00:04:28,721 --> 00:04:30,882
You can't just reschedule
scheduled maintenance

66
00:04:31,024 --> 00:04:33,993
that's been scheduled,
right on the schedule!

67
00:04:35,595 --> 00:04:39,895
The Skipper's right. Candy is candy.
I mean, duty is duty.

68
00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:45,697
Buttons.

69
00:04:46,873 --> 00:04:49,068
Shore leave granted for today, men.

70
00:04:49,208 --> 00:04:50,675
Now, get out of here.

71
00:04:50,810 --> 00:04:52,277
Bunch of knuckleheads.

72
00:04:55,348 --> 00:04:58,511
Where are my guests?
Come out, come out, wherever you are.

73
00:04:58,651 --> 00:05:02,280
It is time to celebrate me
and the many moods of me.

74
00:05:02,422 --> 00:05:04,117
Today, festive me.

75
00:05:04,257 --> 00:05:07,226
King Julien Day! King Julien Day!

76
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,760
Hello. We are here for the candy...

77
00:05:09,896 --> 00:05:10,885
...party.

78
00:05:13,466 --> 00:05:17,027
Yes, welcome, my loyal royal subjects.

79
00:05:17,170 --> 00:05:18,797
Happy King Julien Day!

80
00:05:18,938 --> 00:05:22,271
See, the otter is in the holiday spirit.

81
00:05:23,743 --> 00:05:26,303
- Maurice?
- Everyone now bask in the glory

82
00:05:26,446 --> 00:05:30,314
- that is King Julien.
- Go ahead. Bask.

83
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:35,451
Bask harder!

84
00:05:37,924 --> 00:05:39,516
Now, just the fellows.

85
00:05:41,727 --> 00:05:43,058
Ladies!

86
00:05:46,499 --> 00:05:48,694
The ladies sound a little weak.

87
00:05:48,835 --> 00:05:50,632
You know how that makes me, Maurice.

88
00:05:52,905 --> 00:05:55,738
Hey, now.
Let's get this party started!

89
00:05:55,875 --> 00:05:58,139
Everybody, let's limbo!

90
00:05:58,277 --> 00:06:00,768
Yes! Limbo contest!

91
00:06:08,588 --> 00:06:10,613
Must have candy.

92
00:06:22,068 --> 00:06:25,868
Now, I will make you all feel inferior,
which is proper.

93
00:06:30,910 --> 00:06:32,935
Yes! Did you see?

94
00:06:33,079 --> 00:06:34,808
I am not only the king,

95
00:06:34,947 --> 00:06:37,438
but I am the limbo king, too.

96
00:06:37,583 --> 00:06:39,744
King Julien wins the limbo contest.

97
00:06:39,886 --> 00:06:44,516
Thank you. Thank you for your
boisterous and loving cheers.

98
00:06:45,825 --> 00:06:47,622
Hello, New York!

99
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:50,820
Put your hands
or other appendages together now.

100
00:06:50,963 --> 00:06:55,366
Next, the traditional King Julien Day
tossing of the fruit.

101
00:06:55,501 --> 00:06:56,763
Yeah!

102
00:06:56,903 --> 00:06:58,962
Tossing of the fruit?

103
00:06:59,105 --> 00:07:01,733
Tossing it where exactly?

104
00:07:01,874 --> 00:07:05,275
- At you exactly.
- At us? No.

105
00:07:06,212 --> 00:07:09,613
- Did I hear someone say no?
- He didn't say no.

106
00:07:12,185 --> 00:07:14,050
Chewy centre.

107
00:07:14,187 --> 00:07:17,645
I said "yo. "
As in, "Yo, I am down with that. "

108
00:07:17,790 --> 00:07:20,987
I'll buy that.
Then let the fruit fight begin.

109
00:07:22,562 --> 00:07:26,692
Yes! You love getting hit
with my unripe fruit!

110
00:07:26,832 --> 00:07:28,993
I can tell from your screams!

111
00:07:31,737 --> 00:07:35,070
Nothing more satisfying
than a job well done.

112
00:07:37,610 --> 00:07:39,168
I just cleaned that!

113
00:07:41,647 --> 00:07:42,875
What the...?

114
00:07:45,785 --> 00:07:49,118
Now, where was I? Oh, yeah.
It's time for the bake-off.

115
00:07:49,255 --> 00:07:52,816
You have one hour to bake the king
the best King Julien Day cake ever.

116
00:07:52,959 --> 00:07:55,860
Because what is a party without a cake?

117
00:07:55,995 --> 00:07:59,294
Well, it's still a party, I suppose,
but it feels like something is missing.

118
00:07:59,432 --> 00:08:01,263
Something cakey.

119
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:03,459
Anyone here know how to bake?

120
00:08:04,537 --> 00:08:07,938
Why are they shaking when they
are supposed to be baking, Maurice?

121
00:08:08,074 --> 00:08:10,099
Well, that's not what they're saying.

122
00:08:10,243 --> 00:08:13,940
I think they are,
and I am about to freak on them.

123
00:08:16,415 --> 00:08:18,315
Here it comes! The freak-out!

124
00:08:19,785 --> 00:08:21,810
I've always wanted to learn baking.

125
00:08:22,788 --> 00:08:25,985
See? No need to freak.
The bake-off starts now.

126
00:08:45,711 --> 00:08:47,110
Time!

127
00:08:49,649 --> 00:08:52,379
Very nice. Do I see bugs in there?

128
00:08:52,518 --> 00:08:56,147
Lemurs love bugs, right?

129
00:08:57,657 --> 00:08:59,488
Yes! Ordinarily.

130
00:08:59,625 --> 00:09:01,058
But I am on a low tick diet.

131
00:09:01,193 --> 00:09:05,152
- But, but, but...
- Pineapple upside-down cake

132
00:09:05,298 --> 00:09:08,096
glazed with brown booger.

133
00:09:10,102 --> 00:09:11,865
My mistake. Brown sugar.

134
00:09:13,005 --> 00:09:14,996
Just in case. Next!

135
00:09:17,810 --> 00:09:19,607
Death by chocolate.

136
00:09:20,646 --> 00:09:23,012
The chocolate part sounds promising.

137
00:09:23,149 --> 00:09:25,413
We didn't actually
have chocolate as such...

138
00:09:25,551 --> 00:09:28,714
- Buttons!
- What did you have?

139
00:09:29,622 --> 00:09:32,989
- Mainly mud.
- Nice presentation.

140
00:09:33,125 --> 00:09:36,424
Bring it so that my belly
may taste its yumminess!

141
00:09:36,562 --> 00:09:37,961
I'll bring it.

142
00:09:44,270 --> 00:09:46,465
There. Good as new.

143
00:09:49,408 --> 00:09:52,138
I was so looking forward
to eating my delicious cake.

144
00:09:52,278 --> 00:09:55,543
How can I look forward
to eating nothing? Answer me, Maurice!

145
00:09:55,681 --> 00:09:57,478
They'll make new cakes.

146
00:09:57,616 --> 00:10:00,847
- New bake-off on the double!
- Hold it, party boy.

147
00:10:00,986 --> 00:10:03,454
One quiet day
of scheduled maintenance.

148
00:10:03,589 --> 00:10:06,615
Is that too much to ask? Is it?!

149
00:10:06,759 --> 00:10:09,387
You bombard me
with music and fruit and this.

150
00:10:09,528 --> 00:10:12,725
Newsflash, lower mammal. There's
no such thing as King Julien Day!

151
00:10:15,101 --> 00:10:16,591
Oh, boy.

152
00:10:20,906 --> 00:10:22,703
My cake is back!

153
00:10:22,842 --> 00:10:26,141
It's my cake, everybody!
It came back!

154
00:10:26,278 --> 00:10:27,575
Silly penguin.

155
00:10:27,713 --> 00:10:30,238
Have some in your head, not on it.

156
00:10:30,383 --> 00:10:31,543
Hey! I am thinking

157
00:10:31,684 --> 00:10:35,415
that this was
the best King Julien Day ever.

158
00:10:35,554 --> 00:10:37,181
I think so, too.

159
00:10:37,323 --> 00:10:39,587
- What a sicko.
- Tell me about it.

160
00:10:39,725 --> 00:10:41,818
You saved my big old behind, Skipper.

161
00:10:41,961 --> 00:10:44,395
You earned this crew
one big old pinata.

162
00:10:44,530 --> 00:10:46,691
- Yay!
- Yes!

163
00:10:46,832 --> 00:10:49,926
Yes! Candy! Candy!

164
00:10:52,438 --> 00:10:54,702
- Right.
- Bang up job, Skipper.

165
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:57,604
I can almost taste
that butterscotch lolly.

166
00:10:58,210 --> 00:10:59,871
What do we have here?

167
00:11:00,012 --> 00:11:02,003
A big paper horse?

168
00:11:02,148 --> 00:11:05,914
How did you know that this
is the present I have always wanted?

169
00:11:06,051 --> 00:11:08,383
I will name him... Bob.

170
00:11:08,521 --> 00:11:11,319
Your Majesty, that's actually a pinata.

171
00:11:11,457 --> 00:11:13,118
A pin-what-a?

172
00:11:13,259 --> 00:11:15,454
Why are you making up words, Maurice?

173
00:11:15,594 --> 00:11:18,688
Come, Bob. Let me show you around.

174
00:11:20,232 --> 00:11:22,757
But our... our candy.

175
00:11:23,936 --> 00:11:25,733
Silly King Me.

176
00:11:25,871 --> 00:11:30,171
I almost forgot the traditional
sharing of the sweets.

177
00:11:30,309 --> 00:11:34,040
And wouldn't you know,
Bob has candy guts!

178
00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:35,772
Dig in!

179
00:11:36,315 --> 00:11:39,341
Enjoy Bob's guts candy.

180
00:11:58,075 --> 00:11:59,542
Ready, Maurice?

181
00:12:00,177 --> 00:12:03,305
Wait for it. Almost there.

182
00:12:04,781 --> 00:12:06,271
Now!

183
00:12:06,416 --> 00:12:09,579
Yes! Now, begins the greatest

184
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:11,847
boogie-oogie-oogie sound ever.

185
00:12:16,193 --> 00:12:19,219
Dance, my lemurs, dance!

186
00:12:19,863 --> 00:12:21,330
I like dancing.

187
00:12:25,068 --> 00:12:26,933
I don't like dancing.

188
00:12:27,938 --> 00:12:29,428
My feet are killing me.

189
00:12:29,573 --> 00:12:32,337
Not as much as I will
if you stop dancing.

190
00:12:32,476 --> 00:12:36,503
But, Your Majesty, we just can't
boogie-oogie-oogie like you.

191
00:12:36,647 --> 00:12:39,775
I want to go to bed.

192
00:12:40,450 --> 00:12:44,580
No. Last week, the baboons
shook their shiny red bottoms

193
00:12:44,721 --> 00:12:46,746
eighteen hours straight.

194
00:12:46,890 --> 00:12:49,051
I will not be out-partied.

195
00:12:56,266 --> 00:12:59,531
Roll out, team.
It's time to terminate that tune.

196
00:13:00,604 --> 00:13:02,037
Team?

197
00:13:05,542 --> 00:13:07,066
On your feet, Private.

198
00:13:07,978 --> 00:13:10,208
If that isn't the cutest thing.

199
00:13:10,347 --> 00:13:11,974
Looks like I'm flying solo.

200
00:13:22,326 --> 00:13:24,157
You call that a booty shake?

201
00:13:29,032 --> 00:13:32,229
You must take the music inside of you,

202
00:13:32,369 --> 00:13:34,200
swish it around

203
00:13:34,338 --> 00:13:36,772
and spit it out through your tail.

204
00:13:36,907 --> 00:13:38,340
Try it with me.

205
00:13:38,475 --> 00:13:40,636
Take in the music...

206
00:13:43,146 --> 00:13:46,980
- Hey, not all the music, you greediest!
- It wasn't us.

207
00:13:47,117 --> 00:13:50,484
But what else could make
a boomy box stop booming?

208
00:13:51,855 --> 00:13:53,345
A thief!

209
00:13:54,458 --> 00:13:56,619
- Keep dancing.
- But there's no music!

210
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:58,955
I'll pretend I did not hear that.

211
00:14:00,330 --> 00:14:03,163
Hey! Come back here, you music hater!

212
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:05,530
I don't hate music. I hate noise.

213
00:14:13,477 --> 00:14:14,466
Excuse me.

214
00:14:21,351 --> 00:14:22,750
Lost him.

215
00:14:32,829 --> 00:14:34,592
Mort, what are you doing?

216
00:14:34,731 --> 00:14:36,460
I'm dancing.

217
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:40,400
Give it a rest. Julien has no way
of knowing if we're dancing or not.

218
00:14:40,537 --> 00:14:42,300
Oh, you're right.

219
00:14:43,407 --> 00:14:46,843
- He knows! He knows!
- I like dancing to exhaustion!

220
00:14:51,081 --> 00:14:53,106
Be giving it up, flightless bird!

221
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:55,718
I already have three batteries.

222
00:14:55,852 --> 00:14:58,252
But your noise maker needs all four.

223
00:14:58,388 --> 00:14:59,912
The only way you're getting this one

224
00:15:00,057 --> 00:15:03,220
is if you pry it
from my cold, dead flippers.

225
00:15:04,327 --> 00:15:06,227
Sounds gross, but doable!

226
00:15:16,473 --> 00:15:18,100
Oh, no.

227
00:15:18,241 --> 00:15:21,938
I win! Into your face, penguin!

228
00:15:23,580 --> 00:15:25,548
Don't make a sound.

229
00:15:25,682 --> 00:15:28,879
- We're in Joey's pen.
- Who's Joey?

230
00:15:29,853 --> 00:15:31,878
That's Joey.

231
00:15:36,626 --> 00:15:39,094
A kangaroo?

232
00:15:39,229 --> 00:15:40,526
How cute.

233
00:15:40,664 --> 00:15:43,497
For a moment there,
I thought it would be something dan...

234
00:15:47,237 --> 00:15:49,728
Now look, marsupial,
we don't want any trouble.

235
00:15:49,873 --> 00:15:51,397
We just came to get...

236
00:15:52,809 --> 00:15:55,937
Joey don't rightly
appreciate trespassers, mates.

237
00:15:56,079 --> 00:15:57,546
Makes me mad.

238
00:16:01,051 --> 00:16:04,452
Come down, you bludgers,
before I chuck a wobbly.

239
00:16:05,222 --> 00:16:08,350
Have you never heard
such a mangling of the language

240
00:16:08,492 --> 00:16:11,461
which we are speaking?
Anyhoo, fear not.

241
00:16:11,595 --> 00:16:14,996
I have loyal subjects who live
to sacrifice their skins for me.

242
00:16:16,366 --> 00:16:18,960
Mort! Maurice!

243
00:16:19,102 --> 00:16:21,696
I'm dancing! I'm still dancing!

244
00:16:23,373 --> 00:16:25,398
They are not running
when I am bellowing.

245
00:16:25,542 --> 00:16:27,635
I shall punish them harshly.

246
00:16:28,311 --> 00:16:30,245
OK, crazy-ish idea.

247
00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:33,747
You help me get out of this place.

248
00:16:33,884 --> 00:16:35,647
Team up... with you?

249
00:16:35,785 --> 00:16:39,778
I was thinking more like
you do all of the work,

250
00:16:39,923 --> 00:16:43,256
and I will watch with anticipation.

251
00:16:44,027 --> 00:16:46,154
Well, then forget it, compadre.

252
00:16:46,296 --> 00:16:48,389
It's every animal for himself.

253
00:16:59,075 --> 00:17:00,906
OK, you win.

254
00:17:01,044 --> 00:17:03,535
Go team. First we'll need a plan.

255
00:17:07,484 --> 00:17:09,418
Here goes nothing.

256
00:17:12,088 --> 00:17:14,989
Hey! What do you know? It actually...

257
00:17:19,663 --> 00:17:22,791
Not in the face.
Please spare my money maker.

258
00:17:28,238 --> 00:17:30,365
All systems go.

259
00:17:31,608 --> 00:17:34,008
Where do you two dingoes
think you're going?

260
00:17:38,415 --> 00:17:39,404
Kangaroo!

261
00:17:39,549 --> 00:17:42,416
You cannot be bouncing this high
while I can.

262
00:17:42,552 --> 00:17:43,541
Easy, Ringtail.

263
00:17:43,687 --> 00:17:48,021
Yes, I can do all
the bouncing I choose up here.

264
00:17:48,158 --> 00:17:51,457
- Ringtail!
- Are you not seething with jealousy

265
00:17:51,595 --> 00:17:55,258
as I bounce and bounce
and bounce some more?

266
00:17:55,398 --> 00:17:58,390
Look at my bouncing magnificence!

267
00:18:02,739 --> 00:18:06,573
Hello. Did anyone ever tell you
you have beautiful eyes?

268
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:10,544
- Please, not to be hitting me.
- No worries, mate.

269
00:18:19,055 --> 00:18:23,082
Skipper, if only one of us
can make it out of here,

270
00:18:23,226 --> 00:18:25,990
let it be... Joey.

271
00:18:26,129 --> 00:18:27,858
- Wait, Joey?
- Oh, yeah.

272
00:18:27,998 --> 00:18:30,592
Without the beatings,
this place wouldn't be half bad.

273
00:18:30,734 --> 00:18:32,793
We're getting out of here, Ringtail,

274
00:18:32,936 --> 00:18:35,962
thanks to this handsome fella
and his little dummy friend.

275
00:18:36,106 --> 00:18:39,974
You have failed
to capture my regal profile.

276
00:18:40,110 --> 00:18:43,341
Joey only needs to buy it
for a few precious moments.

277
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:45,004
You see, every morning,

278
00:18:45,148 --> 00:18:47,116
that gate automatically
opens for breakfast.

279
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:51,311
At precisely 0600 hours,
we use our decoys and we break.

280
00:18:51,454 --> 00:18:54,252
Fast. Get my drift?

281
00:18:54,391 --> 00:18:57,918
No, this is too long.
I cannot wait 600 hours.

282
00:18:58,061 --> 00:19:00,029
0600 means 6am.

283
00:19:01,031 --> 00:19:03,591
- When is that?
- From reading the sun correctly,

284
00:19:03,733 --> 00:19:05,257
I'd say...

285
00:19:06,603 --> 00:19:07,968
...now!
- Now?

286
00:19:08,104 --> 00:19:09,628
Now! Now! Now!

287
00:19:11,174 --> 00:19:13,972
Nobody pushes a king out of a tree.

288
00:19:18,515 --> 00:19:20,847
Give you two a proper harrying, I will.

289
00:19:26,323 --> 00:19:28,120
Hey, look what I...

290
00:19:30,026 --> 00:19:31,152
I've been had.

291
00:19:41,705 --> 00:19:43,866
Everyone who is
important to me made it.

292
00:19:44,007 --> 00:19:45,907
Happy ending.

293
00:19:46,710 --> 00:19:50,043
But what is this feeling I am feeling?

294
00:19:50,180 --> 00:19:52,774
It is not a happiness.

295
00:19:52,916 --> 00:19:54,440
Was that the best you...?

296
00:19:55,185 --> 00:19:58,484
It is a feeling that I have not done
all I should have done.

297
00:19:58,621 --> 00:20:02,148
I do not like it.
How do I make it go away?

298
00:20:16,906 --> 00:20:19,136
Please do hurry, penguin.

299
00:20:19,275 --> 00:20:22,574
I am not used to the physical labour.

300
00:20:22,712 --> 00:20:26,648
- Trying!
- I cannot hold it much longer.

301
00:20:26,783 --> 00:20:31,345
What more can I,
a devilishly handsome lemur king, do?

302
00:20:39,929 --> 00:20:41,863
Hurry! Hurry!

303
00:20:47,704 --> 00:20:49,763
What's the matter, wallaby?

304
00:20:49,906 --> 00:20:51,601
Can't kick a moving target?

305
00:20:51,741 --> 00:20:54,232
Wallaby? I'm a kangaroo, mate!

306
00:21:02,085 --> 00:21:03,985
I've been had again.

307
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:06,418
We did it! Up high.

308
00:21:06,556 --> 00:21:07,955
Yes, it is.

309
00:21:08,091 --> 00:21:09,285
Down low.

310
00:21:11,327 --> 00:21:12,351
Too slow?

311
00:21:12,495 --> 00:21:15,157
You... You are too slow.

312
00:21:15,298 --> 00:21:17,095
Never mind.

313
00:21:18,902 --> 00:21:23,032
And so,
I bravely saved the annoying penguin.

314
00:21:24,207 --> 00:21:25,674
But at what cost?

315
00:21:25,809 --> 00:21:30,337
Without my battery,
our booties are sad and still.

316
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:33,244
That's a crying shame, Your Majesty.

317
00:21:33,383 --> 00:21:36,511
Oh, yeah! Shame.

318
00:21:36,653 --> 00:21:38,553
Look alive, lemurs.

319
00:21:39,589 --> 00:21:42,353
- This is no way to party down.
- True that.

320
00:21:42,492 --> 00:21:46,087
Your wisdom exceeds your years,
my flippered friend.

321
00:21:46,229 --> 00:21:49,630
What is a party without mad beats
to rock the streets?

322
00:21:49,766 --> 00:21:52,291
That's why you need this.

323
00:21:55,472 --> 00:21:57,064
For me?

324
00:21:57,207 --> 00:21:59,903
I'm not going to cry.
I'm not going to cry.

325
00:22:00,043 --> 00:22:04,412
Consider it a tip of the beak
for saving my tail.

326
00:22:06,216 --> 00:22:08,741
Now, squeeze in there
with your friends.

327
00:22:08,885 --> 00:22:10,910
The monster beats rage on!

328
00:22:11,054 --> 00:22:13,716
Boogie, my subjects! Yes!

329
00:22:13,857 --> 00:22:15,722
Boogie!

330
00:22:21,698 --> 00:22:25,190
How can you boys still be sleeping?
On your feet, team.

331
00:22:26,202 --> 00:22:29,000
- What's that, Skipper?
- Earmuffs? Well, I'll be.

332
00:22:29,138 --> 00:22:31,299
Only way to catch
quality sack time around here.

333
00:22:33,476 --> 00:22:36,536
Rico, did you forget
to give Skipper his?

334
00:22:38,615 --> 00:22:40,344
Thanks, boys.

335
00:22:42,418 --> 00:22:43,680
Bliss.

336
00:22:55,170 --> 00:22:58,503
Well, I'm going to see your salmon
and raise you two cod.

337
00:23:00,576 --> 00:23:02,806
What's this game called again, Skipper?

338
00:23:02,945 --> 00:23:05,812
Stomp the Wombat.
Are you in or out, Kowalski?

339
00:23:11,487 --> 00:23:14,354
You know, in Tasmania,
cheating at Stomp the Wombat

340
00:23:14,490 --> 00:23:16,287
is a capital crime.

341
00:23:22,231 --> 00:23:25,132
That's funny. I didn't know we
had a hyena exhibit at this zoo.

342
00:23:25,267 --> 00:23:26,632
We don't.

343
00:23:32,541 --> 00:23:34,736
Bogey, twelve o'clock.
Blend, boys, blend.

344
00:23:43,319 --> 00:23:46,652
All right,
I better get you off to the hospital.

345
00:23:56,999 --> 00:23:59,024
- Hello, Maurice.
- Maurice, fill me in.

346
00:23:59,168 --> 00:24:01,329
- Three words or less.
- Well, I...

347
00:24:01,470 --> 00:24:03,870
<i>- No capiche, Try four words.
- I don't think that...</i>

348
00:24:04,006 --> 00:24:05,633
- Make it five.
- If you would listen...

349
00:24:05,774 --> 00:24:09,141
OK, I'm going to give you six words,
but you're wasting valuable time here.

350
00:24:09,278 --> 00:24:12,839
It's King Julien! They just
crated him off to the zoo hospital.

351
00:24:14,283 --> 00:24:15,580
I need hug!

352
00:24:15,718 --> 00:24:17,413
He was just sitting on his throne,

353
00:24:17,553 --> 00:24:20,215
eating his favourite red lychee nuts,
and then...

354
00:24:20,356 --> 00:24:22,517
<i>He went full-speed /oco,</i>

355
00:24:22,658 --> 00:24:25,855
All slobbery mouth
and crazy red eyes.

356
00:24:25,995 --> 00:24:28,361
So? Sounds like business as usual.

357
00:24:28,497 --> 00:24:30,294
Oh, no. This was worse.

358
00:24:30,432 --> 00:24:33,560
And he had this horrible laugh.
I'll never forget it.

359
00:24:39,408 --> 00:24:40,841
Understand what I'm saying?

360
00:24:40,976 --> 00:24:44,002
So how long until
the royal pain recovers?

361
00:24:44,146 --> 00:24:46,046
I don't know. I'm just an advisor.

362
00:24:46,181 --> 00:24:48,672
There has to be someone
for me to advise.

363
00:24:48,817 --> 00:24:51,115
There has to be a king!

364
00:24:51,253 --> 00:24:54,188
- Ring-a-ding-ding, you're a king.
- Me?

365
00:24:54,990 --> 00:24:56,582
I'm just the king's right-hand man.

366
00:24:56,725 --> 00:24:59,558
And you know if the king's
right-hand man becomes the man,

367
00:24:59,695 --> 00:25:02,255
- then the king's left with no right...
- Listen up, soldier.

368
00:25:02,398 --> 00:25:05,959
Until Ringtail returns, someone's gotta
step up, take charge around here.

369
00:25:06,101 --> 00:25:09,559
- But I...
- It's either you or Sad Eyes.

370
00:25:12,741 --> 00:25:14,800
I guess it's on me
to look after things.

371
00:25:14,943 --> 00:25:19,039
But Julien will always be
our one and only king.

372
00:25:19,681 --> 00:25:21,046
There.

373
00:25:24,386 --> 00:25:26,377
We are looking dandy fine here, boy.

374
00:25:26,522 --> 00:25:31,255
When King Julien comes home,
this place will be sparkly fresh.

375
00:25:31,393 --> 00:25:34,055
He will be so happy.

376
00:25:34,196 --> 00:25:35,959
Yeah, say it.

377
00:25:36,098 --> 00:25:38,828
And we will be so tired.

378
00:25:41,603 --> 00:25:42,968
Oh, no!

379
00:25:43,105 --> 00:25:45,471
Can't just be sitting myself
on the royal throne.

380
00:25:45,607 --> 00:25:47,768
That would just be plain wrong.

381
00:25:49,812 --> 00:25:52,474
Then again, what's the harm?

382
00:25:53,482 --> 00:25:56,747
Mort, be a buddy and blow
some more air into our bounce house.

383
00:25:56,885 --> 00:25:59,683
- If it's no bother, of course.
- OK!

384
00:26:05,594 --> 00:26:08,392
You could see
the whole zoo from up here.

385
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:13,065
Bet I could eat just one.

386
00:26:17,239 --> 00:26:19,332
That's pretty tasty.

387
00:26:19,475 --> 00:26:21,636
Maybe just one more.

388
00:26:21,777 --> 00:26:23,108
Or two.

389
00:26:24,279 --> 00:26:26,008
For the king.

390
00:26:55,010 --> 00:26:58,411
This next game was invented
by double-jointed Hungarian acrobats

391
00:26:58,547 --> 00:27:00,276
from the Munich Circus.

392
00:27:05,454 --> 00:27:07,479
You lemurs aren't big
on knocking, are you?

393
00:27:07,623 --> 00:27:08,954
Silence!

394
00:27:10,025 --> 00:27:11,993
I, Maurice,

395
00:27:12,127 --> 00:27:15,563
supreme king of the lemurs...
That sounds good.

396
00:27:15,697 --> 00:27:20,031
...demand that all animals swear
their eternal loyalty

397
00:27:20,169 --> 00:27:22,535
to me, baby.

398
00:27:23,071 --> 00:27:24,504
Or else!

399
00:27:25,674 --> 00:27:28,939
Very funny, Maurice.
The whole power-mad act is hilarious.

400
00:27:29,077 --> 00:27:31,875
- But we're in the middle of something.
- Help me.

401
00:27:32,948 --> 00:27:35,348
That Maurice. What a joker.

402
00:27:35,484 --> 00:27:39,443
I don't know.
That did not exactly sound like jollity.

403
00:27:39,588 --> 00:27:41,055
Did you see his eyes, Skipper?

404
00:27:41,190 --> 00:27:43,590
"Or else," he says.

405
00:27:43,725 --> 00:27:45,750
Or else what, exactly?

406
00:27:49,598 --> 00:27:52,658
Move it! Obey me, or suffer!

407
00:27:57,206 --> 00:28:00,198
All power lines run directly
under the lemur habitat.

408
00:28:00,342 --> 00:28:02,071
Right next to these water pipes.

409
00:28:02,211 --> 00:28:04,645
- Theoretically...
- Maurice has shut down power

410
00:28:04,780 --> 00:28:08,045
and water to all the habitats.
He can control everything now.

411
00:28:08,183 --> 00:28:12,279
Wow. My theory was just about
jury-rigging a giant makeshift hot tub.

412
00:28:12,421 --> 00:28:15,117
- This is much worse.
- We are going in.

413
00:28:15,257 --> 00:28:17,487
Rico, we don't have time
to do this pretty.

414
00:28:25,801 --> 00:28:27,291
<i>Exce/ente,</i>

415
00:28:27,436 --> 00:28:30,735
Power and water controls at six o'clock.
We go on three.

416
00:28:30,872 --> 00:28:32,567
One, two...

417
00:28:33,342 --> 00:28:34,969
...three.

418
00:28:36,645 --> 00:28:39,273
Well, the hot tub theory
is officially dead.

419
00:28:39,414 --> 00:28:42,474
What's your sick
and twisted game, Maurice?

420
00:28:42,618 --> 00:28:46,145
It's King Maurice,
ruler of all I survey!

421
00:28:46,288 --> 00:28:50,384
Surrender to my supreme
and mighty power!

422
00:28:52,594 --> 00:28:54,687
Well, that's going to
be a bit of a problem.

423
00:28:54,830 --> 00:28:58,493
You see, I don't know the meaning
of the word "surrender. "

424
00:28:58,634 --> 00:29:00,829
"Surrender" is a verb, Skipper.

425
00:29:00,969 --> 00:29:03,494
It means to give up or yield...

426
00:29:03,639 --> 00:29:05,038
Oh, right.

427
00:29:05,173 --> 00:29:07,539
Here, I'll do it myself.

428
00:29:07,676 --> 00:29:10,304
I will force you to obey me.

429
00:29:10,445 --> 00:29:11,810
You and what army?

430
00:29:15,450 --> 00:29:18,385
- That army.
- Meet Bada and Bing,

431
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:21,216
personal body guards to the king.

432
00:29:22,991 --> 00:29:24,891
- Bada...
- And Bing...

433
00:29:25,027 --> 00:29:27,495
- Will crush...
- Funny birds.

434
00:29:33,302 --> 00:29:36,100
Rico, tell me you still
have an ace up your sleeve.

435
00:29:40,375 --> 00:29:43,776
- Skipper?
- Wait for it.

436
00:29:51,653 --> 00:29:53,587
They're getting away!
They're getting away!

437
00:29:57,025 --> 00:29:58,925
We got away! Hooray!

438
00:29:59,061 --> 00:30:01,495
Wait, that laugh.

439
00:30:01,630 --> 00:30:04,155
It sounds just like the one we heard
the other night. It's just like...

440
00:30:04,299 --> 00:30:06,824
That deranged ringtail, Julien.

441
00:30:14,609 --> 00:30:17,908
Remember, men, we don't know
what kind of sorry shape he's in.

442
00:30:18,046 --> 00:30:19,673
Prepare yourselves for the worst.

443
00:30:27,356 --> 00:30:28,880
Visitors.

444
00:30:29,024 --> 00:30:34,018
Welcome to my luxury
spa/retreat/getaway palace.

445
00:30:34,162 --> 00:30:36,096
- Where's my candy?
- You!

446
00:30:36,231 --> 00:30:39,291
But you...
You're... You're fine.

447
00:30:39,434 --> 00:30:42,870
But of course. I am eating my
lychee nuts in one moment,

448
00:30:43,004 --> 00:30:46,770
and then, boingo,
I am here in the laps of luxury.

449
00:30:46,908 --> 00:30:49,308
- Life is funny that way.
- Skipper.

450
00:30:49,444 --> 00:30:52,777
It's the nuts. When red lychees go bad,
they release an enzyme

451
00:30:52,914 --> 00:30:54,814
that amplifies aggression in the brain.

452
00:30:54,950 --> 00:30:57,077
The nuts make you nuts.

453
00:30:58,954 --> 00:31:01,548
They gave me this tasty
guava berry milkshake,

454
00:31:01,690 --> 00:31:04,420
and like that,
I was feeling good all over.

455
00:31:07,496 --> 00:31:10,727
The tropical fruit
must counter the nutty enzymes.

456
00:31:10,866 --> 00:31:12,163
Of course.

457
00:31:12,300 --> 00:31:14,996
But if you are cured,
why are you still in the hospital?

458
00:31:15,137 --> 00:31:19,574
Because this vibrating bed is awesome.

459
00:31:19,708 --> 00:31:23,576
Listen up, lemur. Maurice ate those
bad nuts. He went off the deep end.

460
00:31:23,712 --> 00:31:26,237
He's turned the lemur habitat
into an armed fortress.

461
00:31:26,381 --> 00:31:30,647
- He's enslaved the entire zoo.
- I cannot be believing my ears.

462
00:31:30,786 --> 00:31:33,254
Maurice ate my lychee nuts!

463
00:31:34,389 --> 00:31:36,823
Guava berry cure in aerosol form.

464
00:31:36,958 --> 00:31:38,425
One whiff should do the job.

465
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:41,358
This way. I know a secretest way
into my lemur kingdom.

466
00:31:44,032 --> 00:31:47,263
Well, boys, desperate times
call for desperate measures.

467
00:31:48,403 --> 00:31:50,963
- What are you waiting for, Ringtail?
- Who, me?

468
00:31:51,106 --> 00:31:54,564
I am going to be taking
the royal secret passage.

469
00:31:55,844 --> 00:31:57,812
But if you'd rather the potty,

470
00:31:57,946 --> 00:32:01,882
hey, far be it from me
to keep a penguin from water.

471
00:32:02,017 --> 00:32:04,542
- See you later.
- Wait, we didn't know...

472
00:32:08,690 --> 00:32:12,786
I want those penguins found.
Where are they? Where?!

473
00:32:12,928 --> 00:32:15,488
Right here, your royal nutcase.

474
00:32:19,701 --> 00:32:20,963
Ringtail, now!

475
00:32:24,072 --> 00:32:27,041
The game is now
very much being over, Maurice.

476
00:32:27,175 --> 00:32:29,234
I, King Julien,

477
00:32:29,377 --> 00:32:32,141
the one most true glorious...

478
00:32:34,449 --> 00:32:36,849
- Shut up and just do it!
- What? What?

479
00:32:36,985 --> 00:32:40,682
Am I not entitled to a brief,
heroicish moment in my...?

480
00:32:43,658 --> 00:32:45,649
Hey, you got the funny birds?

481
00:32:45,794 --> 00:32:47,853
Yeah, you got the mouthy squirrel?

482
00:32:48,396 --> 00:32:51,695
- Over here.
- I win!

483
00:32:51,833 --> 00:32:54,734
I'm the ultimate ruler of the...

484
00:32:56,271 --> 00:32:58,705
Smell it, Maurice. Smell it up.

485
00:33:00,842 --> 00:33:02,776
Guava berry.

486
00:33:03,612 --> 00:33:07,048
Who would dare wear
the sacred crown of King Julien?

487
00:33:07,182 --> 00:33:09,343
Wait. It's me!

488
00:33:14,256 --> 00:33:17,054
I have no idea what any of these do.

489
00:33:20,295 --> 00:33:21,887
I am calling your bluff

490
00:33:22,030 --> 00:33:25,363
and raising you two
of the pineapples.

491
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:29,266
I'm so embarrassed.
Did I really threaten to destroy you?

492
00:33:29,404 --> 00:33:31,895
Oh, yes! On several occasions.

493
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:34,702
But it wasn't your fault.
It was the nuts.

494
00:33:34,843 --> 00:33:37,334
Just be glad it's all over.

495
00:34:13,388 --> 00:34:16,516
What? Is that...? Are you...?
But how are all these Mort...?

496
00:34:16,658 --> 00:34:18,353
Help!

497
00:34:18,493 --> 00:34:22,054
Maurice, there are Morts
here, there and everywhere.

498
00:34:22,197 --> 00:34:26,395
I must be dreaming,
the most horrible dream inside my head.

499
00:34:26,534 --> 00:34:28,399
Quick, pinch me. Now, bite me.

500
00:34:28,536 --> 00:34:31,130
Now, slap my face
and spank my right buttock.

501
00:34:32,640 --> 00:34:35,302
- Am I awake yet?
- They're the new stuffed Mort dolls

502
00:34:35,443 --> 00:34:38,537
from the zoo gift shop.
The kids just love 'em.

503
00:34:39,714 --> 00:34:43,150
Just look at this silly Mort doll thing.

504
00:34:43,284 --> 00:34:46,845
It is the most ugliest
and stupidest...

505
00:34:46,988 --> 00:34:49,286
That's actually the real Mort.

506
00:34:50,725 --> 00:34:53,125
Hi, it's me.

507
00:34:54,295 --> 00:34:56,456
Very well. On to new business.

508
00:34:56,598 --> 00:34:58,930
Please refrain from yanking
the hats off visitors

509
00:34:59,067 --> 00:35:01,695
when they stroll past your habitats.

510
00:35:01,836 --> 00:35:04,737
There are legal issues,
and more importantly,

511
00:35:04,873 --> 00:35:06,500
it's just plain rude.

512
00:35:08,076 --> 00:35:10,670
Well, of course
we can still fling poo at them.

513
00:35:10,812 --> 00:35:12,803
That's tradition.

514
00:35:14,182 --> 00:35:15,877
Those new Mort dolls sure are cute.

515
00:35:16,017 --> 00:35:18,542
I would go so far as to call them

516
00:35:18,686 --> 00:35:20,677
downright adorable, Marlene.

517
00:35:21,789 --> 00:35:24,553
The more of me, the merrier!

518
00:35:26,127 --> 00:35:28,857
Come on, cheer up.
At least you have a toy.

519
00:35:28,997 --> 00:35:32,626
The last shipment of otter dolls
was sent back to the factory.

520
00:35:32,767 --> 00:35:34,394
Sent back, you are saying?

521
00:35:34,536 --> 00:35:39,496
Well, they did have a few...
I don't know, minor defects.

522
00:35:42,010 --> 00:35:43,375
Defects?

523
00:35:44,879 --> 00:35:47,006
Now, there is an idea.

524
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:54,147
Hey. What's up with the commotion?

525
00:35:54,289 --> 00:35:57,452
Unknown. I'm going to have to wait
for my away team to report

526
00:35:57,592 --> 00:35:59,617
before declaring DEFCON Red.

527
00:36:00,795 --> 00:36:03,355
Real quick,
what exactly is a DEFCON Red?

528
00:36:03,498 --> 00:36:07,867
Classified. Just hope you
never live to see one, sister.

529
00:36:08,603 --> 00:36:11,037
Skipper, reports indicate
that the new Mort plushes

530
00:36:11,172 --> 00:36:13,834
are tainted with
some sort of toxic substance.

531
00:36:13,975 --> 00:36:16,603
They're recalling the whole inventory
back to the factory.

532
00:36:16,744 --> 00:36:20,407
A factory recall? Wait a second.

533
00:36:21,482 --> 00:36:22,972
It's Alice.

534
00:36:23,818 --> 00:36:25,945
No wonder they're
sending these things back.

535
00:36:32,794 --> 00:36:34,091
Skipper, look!

536
00:36:34,963 --> 00:36:38,228
No, that's me in there! I like me!
Bring me back! I fall!

537
00:36:38,566 --> 00:36:39,624
Sad Eyes!

538
00:36:41,002 --> 00:36:43,493
Why do the other me's stink?

539
00:36:48,242 --> 00:36:51,405
It was you, wasn't it?

540
00:36:51,546 --> 00:36:54,572
No, of course not.
How daring of you!

541
00:36:54,716 --> 00:36:55,910
Wait, what do you mean?

542
00:36:56,651 --> 00:36:59,085
What did you do to those Mort dolls?

543
00:36:59,220 --> 00:37:02,656
I am certain
I must not have the slightly,

544
00:37:02,790 --> 00:37:06,749
foggiest idea
of what you are speaking of.

545
00:37:13,901 --> 00:37:15,425
Oh, yes!

546
00:37:15,570 --> 00:37:18,368
Have at them,
my foul black and white friends.

547
00:37:18,506 --> 00:37:20,906
Yes! Spray away!

548
00:37:21,042 --> 00:37:23,909
You there, go, go!

549
00:37:24,045 --> 00:37:26,036
You missed a spot.

550
00:37:32,387 --> 00:37:33,684
Fine.

551
00:37:33,821 --> 00:37:38,155
I was maybe indirectly responsible,
in a way that's not my fault

552
00:37:38,292 --> 00:37:42,023
for the recalling of the annoying
Mort dolls. Who is caring?

553
00:37:42,163 --> 00:37:44,631
- Mort.
- The real Mort.

554
00:37:44,766 --> 00:37:47,997
The one that was taken along
with his stuffed toys.

555
00:37:49,170 --> 00:37:52,936
Stop! Stop with the being so ridiculous!

556
00:37:53,074 --> 00:37:56,168
The real Mort is right here,
safe and soundly.

557
00:37:56,310 --> 00:37:58,244
Isn't that right, Mort?

558
00:37:59,580 --> 00:38:01,946
Well, can't we just
keep this one instead?

559
00:38:02,083 --> 00:38:04,381
Somebody has to go after him.

560
00:38:04,519 --> 00:38:07,044
Don't worry. This is what we do.

561
00:38:08,189 --> 00:38:11,488
Maurice, what have I done?

562
00:38:11,626 --> 00:38:15,027
I already miss
having that annoying Mort around

563
00:38:15,163 --> 00:38:16,596
so that I can hate him.

564
00:38:21,469 --> 00:38:23,903
We have a confirmed address
on the target, Skipper.

565
00:38:24,038 --> 00:38:26,233
Now, some transport.

566
00:38:27,442 --> 00:38:30,775
I told Harry to his face that I'm going to
write him up next time he's late.

567
00:38:30,912 --> 00:38:34,109
Hey. I know everything
that goes on around here.

568
00:38:34,248 --> 00:38:35,510
Everything!

569
00:38:43,124 --> 00:38:45,149
- Kowalski, report.
- It's dark.

570
00:38:45,293 --> 00:38:48,057
I concur.
Rico, weapons check.

571
00:38:49,564 --> 00:38:52,294
Outstanding. Private, sound off.

572
00:38:53,067 --> 00:38:55,297
- Are we there yet?
- Not yet, Private.

573
00:38:55,436 --> 00:38:58,200
Wait for it. Wait for it.

574
00:38:58,339 --> 00:39:01,240
And... move out. Now!

575
00:39:03,578 --> 00:39:06,240
Right. Back in the box.

576
00:39:06,948 --> 00:39:10,384
- Any word on the rescue?
- Yes, we have a delivery confirmation.

577
00:39:10,518 --> 00:39:13,078
Skipper and company were delivered
to the factory

578
00:39:13,221 --> 00:39:17,351
at exactly 7:30am,
Eastern Standard Time.

579
00:39:17,492 --> 00:39:20,689
Signed for by a C.W. Smith.

580
00:39:21,662 --> 00:39:23,323
Rico! Get him out of sight.

581
00:39:23,464 --> 00:39:25,796
Kowalski, have you bypassed
the security scanner yet?

582
00:39:25,933 --> 00:39:29,630
I can't seem to crack
the retinal scrambling code.

583
00:39:31,205 --> 00:39:34,333
Keep at it. Mort's here somewhere,
and he's counting on us.

584
00:39:48,456 --> 00:39:51,983
Switching to collate on my mark.

585
00:39:52,126 --> 00:39:54,253
Five, four, three...

586
00:39:56,297 --> 00:39:58,356
Evasive action!
We have enemy movement.

587
00:39:58,499 --> 00:40:00,899
Skipper, we're taking fire!

588
00:40:01,035 --> 00:40:04,266
We're also giving some.
Right, Rico?

589
00:40:06,073 --> 00:40:09,873
Steady, boys.
Stand by to toast this marshmallow!

590
00:40:11,679 --> 00:40:13,670
Popcorn, anyone? It's fresh.

591
00:40:13,815 --> 00:40:15,783
- Julien?
- How did he get here?

592
00:40:15,917 --> 00:40:20,320
Oh, I sent myself super-platinum
premier overnight express.

593
00:40:20,454 --> 00:40:22,012
This is how a king is to be rolling.

594
00:40:22,156 --> 00:40:24,784
But you're the reason
Mort's here in the first place.

595
00:40:24,926 --> 00:40:28,987
Which is why I must lend
my kingly cleverness to help.

596
00:40:29,130 --> 00:40:33,226
So, who enjoys the honour
of carrying my luggage?

597
00:40:33,367 --> 00:40:36,165
Rico, stamp his royal highness

598
00:40:36,304 --> 00:40:38,135
"return to sender. "

599
00:40:41,509 --> 00:40:44,478
OK, you win. Forget the luggage.

600
00:40:44,612 --> 00:40:47,513
Skipper, we could use
an extra set of eyes

601
00:40:47,648 --> 00:40:49,240
to cover our left flank.

602
00:40:51,919 --> 00:40:54,012
All right, Ringtail. You're in.

603
00:40:55,356 --> 00:40:58,325
Ringtail. Is this my code name?

604
00:41:20,548 --> 00:41:22,243
Sweet Mother MacArthur!

605
00:41:22,383 --> 00:41:24,180
Will you just take a lookout position?

606
00:41:24,318 --> 00:41:27,287
Why did you not just say so?

607
00:41:29,991 --> 00:41:33,586
<i>Defective items schedu/ed
for immediate destruction,</i>

608
00:41:35,897 --> 00:41:38,764
Somebody help me!

609
00:41:42,536 --> 00:41:45,505
Oh, no. This crown is all wrong.

610
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:49,098
My noble kingly nose
is looking too big here.

611
00:41:49,243 --> 00:41:52,076
Where is the quality controlling
in this dump?

612
00:42:06,327 --> 00:42:07,419
What?

613
00:42:07,561 --> 00:42:11,657
You are now officially
a hazard to this operation.

614
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:14,497
Double-time it, boys.

615
00:42:14,635 --> 00:42:17,365
Just stay out of sight, Ringtail.

616
00:42:25,146 --> 00:42:27,444
Kowalski, hit the kill switch.

617
00:42:29,450 --> 00:42:30,974
Kill the hit switch!

618
00:42:31,686 --> 00:42:33,347
Switch the kill hit!

619
00:42:35,890 --> 00:42:38,882
<i>Danger, Danger, Danger,</i>

620
00:42:46,167 --> 00:42:47,156
Skipper!

621
00:42:47,301 --> 00:42:51,704
What kind of sick and twisted
toy factory is this?

622
00:42:51,839 --> 00:42:54,933
Hang on. I'm going to bypass
the central wire...

623
00:43:20,234 --> 00:43:22,031
Rico, surprise me.

624
00:43:29,577 --> 00:43:31,670
Last words, anyone?

625
00:43:35,916 --> 00:43:38,612
- Ringtail to the rescue!
- Ringtail!

626
00:43:38,753 --> 00:43:42,621
No need to drop to your knees
to thank and worship me.

627
00:43:53,167 --> 00:43:54,691
We're safe!

628
00:43:57,238 --> 00:44:01,265
And so, as of tonight,
there's been no word from the penguins

629
00:44:01,409 --> 00:44:05,743
or Julien concerning their
valiant efforts to rescue Mort.

630
00:44:05,880 --> 00:44:08,110
I'm afraid we'll have
to assume the worst.

631
00:44:13,220 --> 00:44:15,780
- Hi!
- You guys made it!

632
00:44:15,923 --> 00:44:17,788
And Mort! He's home!

633
00:44:17,925 --> 00:44:20,155
Yeah, baby!

634
00:44:23,330 --> 00:44:26,663
I am so happy to have
my kingdom together again.

635
00:44:26,801 --> 00:44:29,793
Mort, you are free
to resume worshiping me.

636
00:44:29,937 --> 00:44:32,633
There's no place like home.

637
00:44:32,773 --> 00:44:35,606
Check it out.
The zoo has a new bestseller.

638
00:44:35,743 --> 00:44:37,836
Well, would you look at that.

639
00:44:37,978 --> 00:44:39,946
Kudos, Private.

640
00:44:40,081 --> 00:44:42,345
Private? Private.

641
00:44:42,483 --> 00:44:44,075
Hello?

642
00:44:44,218 --> 00:44:45,947
Anybody?!

643
00:45:02,607 --> 00:45:06,509
All right, men. We're up
against nine ninja warriors.

644
00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:16,851
Missed one.

645
00:45:26,231 --> 00:45:29,223
- Nice work, Rico.
- Morning, guys.

646
00:45:31,203 --> 00:45:33,228
Might wanna watch out
for the ninjas, Marlene.

647
00:45:33,371 --> 00:45:37,535
- You mean bowling pins?
- I mean ninjas.

648
00:45:37,676 --> 00:45:40,076
Don't you see the little faces on them?

649
00:45:40,212 --> 00:45:43,375
Why are you guys working, anyway?
Come on, it's Fun Day!

650
00:45:43,515 --> 00:45:45,881
Fun day? Rico, code blue.

651
00:45:46,017 --> 00:45:48,383
Private, weapons check.
Kowalski, options for...

652
00:45:48,520 --> 00:45:51,751
Hold on, wait, what is this Fun Day?

653
00:45:51,890 --> 00:45:53,323
Few humans visit on Mondays.

654
00:45:53,458 --> 00:45:57,258
Thus, our zoo overlords
renamed Monday "Fun Day. "

655
00:45:57,395 --> 00:46:01,491
Why wasn't this in my morning briefing?
How am I supposed to know this stuff?

656
00:46:01,566 --> 00:46:04,296
Come on, I'm not a mind reader.

657
00:46:04,436 --> 00:46:08,031
You, Skipper, are just...
not Fun Day material.

658
00:46:09,274 --> 00:46:11,174
- Hit the brakes, sister.
- What?

659
00:46:11,309 --> 00:46:14,767
I've taken down an angry walrus with
a wing and a prayer and another wing.

660
00:46:14,913 --> 00:46:18,144
- I can handle anything.
- Except fun.

661
00:46:18,283 --> 00:46:21,275
Especially fun. Right, boys?

662
00:46:21,953 --> 00:46:24,513
- Big fun.
- Yes, Skipper, sure.

663
00:46:24,656 --> 00:46:30,026
- Hey, I'm as fun as the next guy.
- Not if the next guy is that guy.

664
00:46:32,731 --> 00:46:35,199
It makes my tummy tingle!

665
00:46:37,335 --> 00:46:40,133
Hello, silly penguin.
What are you doing in my bouncy?

666
00:46:40,272 --> 00:46:44,868
Because it's Fun Day. And certain
sea mammals think I'm no fun.

667
00:46:45,010 --> 00:46:48,343
Hey, Marlene, check out this fun move!

668
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:50,573
I call it Corkscrew.

669
00:47:29,788 --> 00:47:31,813
You! You did this!

670
00:47:31,956 --> 00:47:35,392
- What?
- You did this.

671
00:47:35,527 --> 00:47:38,189
I know, I know.
I take full responsibility.

672
00:47:38,330 --> 00:47:41,299
- Well, 90 percent.
- I said, "Have fun. "

673
00:47:41,433 --> 00:47:44,493
- I did not say, "Go nuts. "
- Right.

674
00:47:44,636 --> 00:47:47,764
I should not have corkscrewed.
Shame on me.

675
00:47:50,408 --> 00:47:53,673
Maurice, it was all in fun.
Come on, bring it in.

676
00:47:53,812 --> 00:47:56,042
- Bring it in.
- I'm not laughing!

677
00:47:57,182 --> 00:47:59,275
All right, I'll try
to calm down the screamer

678
00:47:59,417 --> 00:48:01,749
while you guys go get his crown.
Sound like a plan?

679
00:48:01,886 --> 00:48:04,013
It does sound like a plan, Marlene.

680
00:48:04,155 --> 00:48:08,216
Gentlemen, commence Operation
Give the Furry Cry baby His Bottle.

681
00:48:10,528 --> 00:48:12,826
She did stop the screaming.

682
00:48:14,299 --> 00:48:15,789
I will get you for...

683
00:48:18,503 --> 00:48:21,734
How am I supposed
to be kingly without a crown?

684
00:48:21,873 --> 00:48:23,568
It is the proof of my kingliness.

685
00:48:24,042 --> 00:48:27,409
And that is why I'm going to make you...

686
00:48:27,545 --> 00:48:30,605
Ready? Wait for it.

687
00:48:30,749 --> 00:48:32,808
...a new crown!

688
00:48:33,451 --> 00:48:36,113
But the old crown and I have been
through so much together.

689
00:48:36,254 --> 00:48:41,089
Yes, yes, but it wasn't
as amazingly cool as...

690
00:48:43,595 --> 00:48:44,960
...this!

691
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:52,837
- It is puffy and complicated.
- Like me.

692
00:48:56,508 --> 00:48:57,600
Maurice!

693
00:49:02,147 --> 00:49:04,843
I got you! Or not.

694
00:49:13,825 --> 00:49:15,793
I want my old crown.

695
00:49:15,927 --> 00:49:18,521
Skipper, turns out
the new crown didn't fly.

696
00:49:18,663 --> 00:49:20,460
It did fly, too much.

697
00:49:20,598 --> 00:49:22,862
Not to worry, Marlene.
We're on the trail.

698
00:49:29,474 --> 00:49:30,839
Rico.

699
00:49:32,076 --> 00:49:33,543
Private, hold the flashlight.

700
00:49:34,446 --> 00:49:35,743
Oh, dear.

701
00:49:37,749 --> 00:49:39,774
I don't like the looks of this.

702
00:49:39,918 --> 00:49:42,045
Keen instinct tells me
there's danger ahead.

703
00:49:42,187 --> 00:49:45,179
It's got my name written all over it.

704
00:49:45,323 --> 00:49:46,654
You three wait here.

705
00:49:47,192 --> 00:49:50,355
I think I'd prefer to tag along,
if it's all the same, Skipper.

706
00:49:50,495 --> 00:49:53,521
Denied, Private.
I corkscrewed us into this.

707
00:49:53,665 --> 00:49:55,394
I'll go solo.

708
00:49:57,368 --> 00:50:01,429
But you're forgetting the penguin credo:
"Never swim alone. "

709
00:50:01,573 --> 00:50:03,666
Skipper, we're in this together.

710
00:50:09,113 --> 00:50:11,707
And by "this,"
I mean a steel cage trap.

711
00:50:15,253 --> 00:50:19,349
My head is naked.
My head is nude.

712
00:50:19,491 --> 00:50:23,518
My head is crownless!
Dark is my mood.

713
00:50:23,661 --> 00:50:26,596
Crazy poetry, it's good stuff.

714
00:50:26,731 --> 00:50:31,065
- I want my crown!
- And I have your crown,

715
00:50:31,202 --> 00:50:36,037
a crown you'll love as much
as you love yourself, because...

716
00:50:36,641 --> 00:50:38,438
It's you!

717
00:50:38,576 --> 00:50:42,637
I'm thinking there is an awesome amount
of fabulousness going on here.

718
00:50:44,415 --> 00:50:46,144
It is hot with handsomeness.

719
00:50:46,284 --> 00:50:49,082
And here's the best part!

720
00:50:52,457 --> 00:50:55,290
My need for beauty
and my need for fizzy drink,

721
00:50:55,426 --> 00:50:57,291
both are satisfied.

722
00:51:04,769 --> 00:51:06,202
My little head!

723
00:51:07,105 --> 00:51:10,541
I like you hideously disfigured.

724
00:51:14,546 --> 00:51:17,413
- Get 'em!
- Oh, boy. Sewer rats!

725
00:51:17,549 --> 00:51:19,574
They're actually quite cute.

726
00:51:21,619 --> 00:51:27,285
Attention, little rodentia.
Has anyone seen a leafy crown?

727
00:51:28,693 --> 00:51:30,820
- Maybe.
- What's it to you?

728
00:51:30,962 --> 00:51:34,796
- We need it, pronto.
- It belongs to our king.

729
00:51:34,933 --> 00:51:37,424
And there's only one way
to take it from us.

730
00:51:37,569 --> 00:51:40,299
- Smile and say "please"?
- No!

731
00:51:40,438 --> 00:51:44,465
- Paw-to-paw combat.
- Beat the king, get the crown.

732
00:51:44,609 --> 00:51:48,045
Beat the king, get the crown.
Beat the king, get the crown.

733
00:51:48,179 --> 00:51:49,669
Beat the king, get the crown.

734
00:51:49,814 --> 00:51:52,078
- Beat the king, get the crown.
- OK.

735
00:51:52,216 --> 00:51:55,185
I'll go easy on him.
Where is the little guy?

736
00:51:59,624 --> 00:52:02,058
- You are toast.
- What was that, Private?

737
00:52:02,193 --> 00:52:04,593
I mean crusty on the outside,
soft and warm on the inside

738
00:52:04,729 --> 00:52:06,924
- and good in a jam.
- That's nice.

739
00:52:07,065 --> 00:52:10,626
You are going down, clown!
Down to Rat Town.

740
00:52:11,269 --> 00:52:13,396
Aren't we already there?

741
00:52:15,340 --> 00:52:19,174
Now, this might be working for me.

742
00:52:19,310 --> 00:52:22,370
Yes! Smart.

743
00:52:22,513 --> 00:52:24,947
Do you really think
you can pull it off?

744
00:52:25,083 --> 00:52:26,778
- Snake!
- I don't... Come on.

745
00:52:26,918 --> 00:52:29,716
- Snake!
- That was a good look.

746
00:52:29,854 --> 00:52:33,085
<i>- Tell me you found the crown.
- The crown's been found,</i>

747
00:52:33,224 --> 00:52:35,886
That's great. Wait, where's Skipper?

748
00:52:36,027 --> 00:52:38,120
<i>Skipper is unab/e
to take your ca// right now,</i>

749
00:52:38,262 --> 00:52:41,060
<i>He's about to batt/e
a mutated rodent war/ord,</i>

750
00:52:43,401 --> 00:52:47,360
- Kowalski, analysis.
- This appears to be a former lab rat,

751
00:52:47,505 --> 00:52:49,530
thus the extreme mutations.

752
00:52:52,677 --> 00:52:54,907
Well, incredible size
and brute strength...

753
00:52:56,014 --> 00:52:59,848
...and magnificent aim
aren't... everything.

754
00:53:07,392 --> 00:53:09,917
You and me, bird, one on one.

755
00:53:10,962 --> 00:53:12,987
Talk about no help from the flock.

756
00:53:13,131 --> 00:53:15,599
Agreed. No assist from the flock.

757
00:53:16,968 --> 00:53:19,436
Let's dance. I'll lead.

758
00:53:28,479 --> 00:53:31,915
That the best you got?
Bird, that is some weak sauce.

759
00:53:33,785 --> 00:53:34,945
Missed me that time.

760
00:53:37,889 --> 00:53:39,584
Feel the rat.

761
00:53:43,928 --> 00:53:46,123
Who's your rat daddy?

762
00:53:54,939 --> 00:53:58,136
How do you like me now,
flightless bird?

763
00:54:03,848 --> 00:54:06,715
I knew you'd go
running home to your... Mama!

764
00:54:08,219 --> 00:54:11,382
- Poor Skipper. I can't look.
- This is the worst Fun Day ever.

765
00:54:11,522 --> 00:54:14,389
Fun Day... Of course!

766
00:54:16,994 --> 00:54:18,256
The Corkscrew!

767
00:54:24,635 --> 00:54:27,069
Who's got the weak sauce, now?

768
00:54:35,146 --> 00:54:38,741
Look, look, look! OK, you could
be king of the cowboys.

769
00:54:38,883 --> 00:54:41,443
- Ride 'em, part...
- Shut up, OK?

770
00:54:41,586 --> 00:54:46,023
Can you not see that your king,
which was me until the incident,

771
00:54:46,157 --> 00:54:48,557
- is brooding?
- OK. OK, I failed.

772
00:54:48,693 --> 00:54:54,393
I failed. Everybody, I failed.
There. I am an otter failure.

773
00:54:54,532 --> 00:54:58,263
If I could just say a magic word
and make your crown appear, I would.

774
00:54:58,903 --> 00:55:01,804
The magic word is... Fun Day!

775
00:55:02,740 --> 00:55:04,298
My crown!

776
00:55:06,611 --> 00:55:10,047
How I have missed you,
little head thing!

777
00:55:10,982 --> 00:55:12,847
It has a smudgy spot on it.

778
00:55:12,984 --> 00:55:15,145
Well, you see, there were these sewer...

779
00:55:15,286 --> 00:55:20,383
No, this simply will not do.
Maurice, bring me my spare crown.

780
00:55:23,161 --> 00:55:26,688
- Much better.
- A spare crown?

781
00:55:26,831 --> 00:55:29,925
He just had, you know,
just sitting around...

782
00:55:30,067 --> 00:55:33,036
All along, a spare crown, all along?

783
00:55:33,171 --> 00:55:35,332
Well, yeah. For emergencies.

784
00:55:35,473 --> 00:55:38,738
What kind of fool king
would only have one crown? Please.

785
00:55:40,878 --> 00:55:45,577
What? No! No!
Never on a Fun Day, seriously.

786
00:56:02,558 --> 00:56:04,355
Come on, challenge me!

787
00:56:04,494 --> 00:56:07,827
Give your king a real race
to the bouncy!

788
00:56:10,967 --> 00:56:12,696
Hey, that's too real!

789
00:56:12,835 --> 00:56:15,531
Give me much slower racing now.

790
00:56:16,973 --> 00:56:18,702
Look, I'm running.

791
00:56:23,379 --> 00:56:24,368
Your Majesty!

792
00:56:26,482 --> 00:56:31,181
Something dangerous and painful
has happened to the royal bouncy.

793
00:56:31,320 --> 00:56:33,982
Mort, you jump too, so we make sure.

794
00:56:36,092 --> 00:56:39,619
OK, now Maurice,
but headfirst this time.

795
00:56:41,964 --> 00:56:44,899
Total inflation pump failure
on the lemurs' bouncy, Skipper.

796
00:56:46,169 --> 00:56:48,637
Polar bear cooling fan,
kangaroo auto-feeder,

797
00:56:48,771 --> 00:56:50,739
chimp reading lamp, all down!

798
00:56:50,873 --> 00:56:53,899
Looks like we've got
some bad habitats, boys.

799
00:56:54,043 --> 00:56:57,410
- Unacceptable.
- I don't know where the night light...

800
00:56:58,114 --> 00:56:59,911
Attention, panicky mob.

801
00:57:00,049 --> 00:57:03,382
Clearly, this is phase one
in the space squid invasion.

802
00:57:03,519 --> 00:57:06,044
I'd advise you all to keep your heads.

803
00:57:06,189 --> 00:57:09,647
Space squids always
start with the heads.

804
00:57:11,360 --> 00:57:15,626
Space squids? Guys,
I think we're just having a blackout.

805
00:57:15,765 --> 00:57:19,826
Well, that's just what the squids
would want us to think, Marlene.

806
00:57:20,403 --> 00:57:23,099
If you truly are Marlene.

807
00:57:23,239 --> 00:57:28,472
You know, I believe she's right.
The entire city is suspiciously dark.

808
00:57:28,611 --> 00:57:33,071
Well, I guess that's a perfectly
logical explanation for...

809
00:57:34,050 --> 00:57:37,213
- Show your tentacles, you squid spy!
- Hey! All right, let go!

810
00:57:37,353 --> 00:57:39,753
- What are you do...?
- Her story checks out.

811
00:57:39,889 --> 00:57:43,222
A blackout?
We're going to run out of food!

812
00:57:43,760 --> 00:57:46,820
I'm concerned
about the rise in crime rates.

813
00:57:46,963 --> 00:57:50,091
Yeah, I hear that's a real problem.

814
00:57:51,167 --> 00:57:54,830
Not to worry.
Penguins always have a plan.

815
00:57:55,371 --> 00:57:57,566
My generator can
supply emergency power,

816
00:57:57,707 --> 00:57:59,937
and with the food rationing
program we've set up...

817
00:58:00,076 --> 00:58:04,137
Stop! This is no time for planning
and reasonableness!

818
00:58:04,680 --> 00:58:08,241
With no electrically power,
the zoo has now become...

819
00:58:08,885 --> 00:58:10,352
...a jungle!

820
00:58:10,486 --> 00:58:12,886
And who is the king of the jungle?

821
00:58:14,390 --> 00:58:15,584
OK, I'll give you a hint.

822
00:58:15,725 --> 00:58:19,388
He is also the king of the zoo
and the outlying midtown area.

823
00:58:19,896 --> 00:58:23,229
And it is me. OK, no more hints.

824
00:58:25,134 --> 00:58:28,763
Negative. There is no
such thing as jungle law.

825
00:58:28,905 --> 00:58:33,274
Oh, really? Perhaps everyone
would like to hear the opinionings

826
00:58:33,409 --> 00:58:35,741
of a certified jungle lawyer.

827
00:58:39,382 --> 00:58:42,476
All hail King Julien. Case closed.

828
00:58:42,618 --> 00:58:44,313
Case open!

829
00:58:44,587 --> 00:58:46,782
You can't seriously be falling for this!

830
00:58:48,324 --> 00:58:50,656
Well, he's got a briefcase.

831
00:58:52,962 --> 00:58:56,363
This is going to end very badly,
Your Majesty.

832
00:58:56,499 --> 00:58:58,592
And when this jungle law does fail,

833
00:58:58,734 --> 00:59:02,135
I will have four sweet,
sweet words for you.

834
00:59:02,271 --> 00:59:04,899
Oh, "I love King Julien?"

835
00:59:05,041 --> 00:59:06,065
Yeah... No.

836
00:59:06,209 --> 00:59:08,109
I told you so.

837
00:59:08,477 --> 00:59:11,037
- What?
- Nobody tells the king,

838
00:59:11,180 --> 00:59:14,377
- "I told you so. "
- It is unspoken of.

839
00:59:14,517 --> 00:59:17,543
Well, we'll just see about that.

840
00:59:18,154 --> 00:59:20,748
Yes, we will. And right now,

841
00:59:20,890 --> 00:59:25,384
I will be seeing you penguins
giving your king the royal sponge bath.

842
00:59:30,266 --> 00:59:31,358
I call topsies.

843
00:59:31,500 --> 00:59:35,459
Private, we're not part of this
kook-ball's kingdom. Come on, boys!

844
00:59:37,240 --> 00:59:39,538
Here you go. Knock yourself out.

845
00:59:41,377 --> 00:59:44,175
And now begins the gloriousness

846
00:59:44,313 --> 00:59:47,373
of the goldenish age of the new dawn

847
00:59:47,516 --> 00:59:51,748
of the mighty reign of jungle law!

848
00:59:55,291 --> 00:59:57,589
Hang on.
I forgot to lock the security hatch.

849
00:59:59,028 --> 01:00:02,020
What in the name
of Eisenhower's oatmeal?

850
01:00:08,771 --> 01:00:11,604
What happened to all the peanuts?

851
01:00:11,741 --> 01:00:12,867
OK.

852
01:00:14,310 --> 01:00:15,800
That was fast.

853
01:00:16,646 --> 01:00:21,083
- What in blazes is going on here?
- Hand over your food, ya mooks!

854
01:00:24,587 --> 01:00:27,647
Are you gorillas going to
give everything back nicely,

855
01:00:27,790 --> 01:00:32,591
- or does this get ugly?
- You have feet? Give Mort feet.

856
01:00:32,728 --> 01:00:35,526
Mort need feet!

857
01:00:36,565 --> 01:00:40,899
- You stole Sad Eyes, too?
- You never know when you'll need one.

858
01:00:43,940 --> 01:00:46,602
Oh, guys, guys.
Thank goodness you're back.

859
01:00:46,742 --> 01:00:49,677
- It's a madhouse up here!
- What happened to King Julien?

860
01:00:49,812 --> 01:00:53,714
He must've cracked like an Easter egg.
I knew it.

861
01:00:53,849 --> 01:00:57,478
All right, men, jungle law
has stunk up our zoo long enough.

862
01:00:57,620 --> 01:01:00,248
Time to apply some penguin-scented

863
01:01:00,389 --> 01:01:03,324
- disinfectant to this mess.
- Mess?

864
01:01:04,660 --> 01:01:07,424
Don't be so wrong, silly penguin.

865
01:01:07,563 --> 01:01:09,861
Clearly, the screaming and rampaging

866
01:01:09,999 --> 01:01:14,026
is to celebrate three
successful minutes of jungle law.

867
01:01:14,170 --> 01:01:15,865
Hooray!

868
01:01:16,739 --> 01:01:19,139
Also, I am resting, not hiding.

869
01:01:19,275 --> 01:01:23,974
Well, well, well, King Ringtail.
I believe I owe you a few words.

870
01:01:24,113 --> 01:01:27,207
In random order, they are,
"Told I so you. "

871
01:01:28,551 --> 01:01:30,246
Allow me to unscramble.

872
01:01:31,053 --> 01:01:33,385
Shushies. This is not "I told you so. "

873
01:01:33,522 --> 01:01:36,423
The royal me is still
on top of all these things.

874
01:01:36,993 --> 01:01:39,154
Ringtail, no! They'll rip you apart!

875
01:01:40,796 --> 01:01:42,423
Jungle rule stinks.

876
01:01:42,565 --> 01:01:46,228
Yes, yes, everybody
likes the chaos and the mayhem,

877
01:01:46,369 --> 01:01:49,497
but we need orderly chaos
and nice mayhem.

878
01:01:49,638 --> 01:01:53,768
- You stink, Julien!
- OK, we talked about this, Pinky.

879
01:01:53,909 --> 01:01:57,868
We express our feelings with words,
not the violent throwing of...

880
01:01:59,181 --> 01:02:03,515
Yo, Bada. What kind of ransom
you get for a king these days?

881
01:02:05,821 --> 01:02:07,789
Playtime's over, primates.

882
01:02:12,995 --> 01:02:16,692
If I don't get some food right now...

883
01:02:21,470 --> 01:02:22,994
Peanut head!

884
01:02:26,942 --> 01:02:28,341
Kowalski, analysis!

885
01:02:29,345 --> 01:02:33,281
King Julien requires immediate rescue.
But to stop the zoo-wide panic,

886
01:02:33,416 --> 01:02:35,976
we need to get the criminal element
under control, too.

887
01:02:37,119 --> 01:02:39,451
Also, somebody should
probably take care of that.

888
01:02:39,588 --> 01:02:41,613
We've got three problems:

889
01:02:41,757 --> 01:02:44,692
Ringtail, Sad Eyes
and criminal gorillas.

890
01:02:44,827 --> 01:02:49,264
I want teams of two on each.
No man enters the danger zone solo.

891
01:02:50,433 --> 01:02:53,527
Skipper, that would
leave us two men shy...

892
01:02:53,669 --> 01:02:54,795
Never tell me the math!

893
01:02:54,937 --> 01:02:58,065
If we need two recruits,
we'll find two recruits!

894
01:02:59,575 --> 01:03:01,270
Wait. What's...?

895
01:03:13,556 --> 01:03:17,993
- OK, that was... kind of fun.
- Get 'em!

896
01:03:22,932 --> 01:03:26,459
It's OK, Mort.
We're not going to hurt you.

897
01:03:26,602 --> 01:03:29,070
Not true, Private.
I did authorize lethal force.

898
01:03:35,978 --> 01:03:39,539
Peanut head! Peanut head!

899
01:03:39,682 --> 01:03:41,650
We're only here to talk, friend.

900
01:03:41,784 --> 01:03:44,344
Straight turkey, no judgments.

901
01:03:44,487 --> 01:03:47,820
Are you crazy? The dude's head
doesn't even look like a peanut!

902
01:03:47,957 --> 01:03:50,687
What? How dare you insult

903
01:03:50,826 --> 01:03:53,624
my gloriously peanut-shaped head!

904
01:03:54,697 --> 01:03:56,426
- Oh, golly.
- That ain't right.

905
01:04:05,040 --> 01:04:06,507
Bye-bye.

906
01:04:15,985 --> 01:04:18,180
OK, come on, let's return the loot.

907
01:04:25,861 --> 01:04:27,590
Time to change tactics.

908
01:04:27,730 --> 01:04:30,494
Tiny lemur! The feet need you!

909
01:04:30,633 --> 01:04:32,157
The feet?

910
01:04:35,571 --> 01:04:40,770
Why won't you go down, peanut?!

911
01:04:44,146 --> 01:04:45,272
Peanuts!

912
01:04:51,153 --> 01:04:55,214
I have seen my entire life
and many gigantic nose nuggets

913
01:04:55,357 --> 01:04:58,815
flashing before my eyes.
Thank the sky spirits that is over.

914
01:04:58,961 --> 01:05:00,155
Feet!

915
01:05:01,130 --> 01:05:03,792
There he is!
You were supposed to protect us!

916
01:05:03,933 --> 01:05:09,269
- Hey, I could really hurt somebody.
- Jungle law is for fools, baby!

917
01:05:09,405 --> 01:05:13,398
Yes, yes, everything turned out
most wonderfully in the end.

918
01:05:13,542 --> 01:05:16,978
You may now decide among yourselves
how to praise me.

919
01:05:18,247 --> 01:05:20,613
I demand to talk to my jungle lawyer!

920
01:05:21,217 --> 01:05:23,208
Dude with a briefcase?
Haven't seen him.

921
01:05:23,652 --> 01:05:27,247
Guys, we have to do something.
We can't just let this happen.

922
01:05:27,389 --> 01:05:31,120
I don't know. I am dying
to see that catapult in action.

923
01:05:31,260 --> 01:05:35,321
Looks like this is my last chance
to say what needs to be said.

924
01:05:37,066 --> 01:05:41,264
- So long, sucker.
- A moment, please!

925
01:05:41,403 --> 01:05:43,769
I've got a few words for you, Ringtail.

926
01:05:43,906 --> 01:05:46,568
Oh, no, not now. He couldn't...

927
01:05:48,010 --> 01:05:51,411
I told you...

928
01:05:52,548 --> 01:05:54,448
...that this plan was genius!

929
01:05:55,317 --> 01:05:57,979
- Say what?
- His jungle majesty knew that

930
01:05:58,120 --> 01:06:00,588
in a crisis, the biggest danger
is mass panic.

931
01:06:00,723 --> 01:06:04,523
So he sets up this post-apocalyptic
wasteland scenario

932
01:06:04,660 --> 01:06:08,118
to keep everyone's mind
off the blackout. Brilliant.

933
01:06:09,431 --> 01:06:11,922
- All right.
- Yeah.

934
01:06:16,705 --> 01:06:18,866
- Boy, that's great!
- Yeah!

935
01:06:20,242 --> 01:06:23,143
Skipper, you gave up
an "I told you so. "

936
01:06:23,279 --> 01:06:25,338
That's the most
noble thing I've ever seen.

937
01:06:25,481 --> 01:06:29,542
Sometimes, Private, you've just got
to set your sights a little higher.

938
01:06:29,685 --> 01:06:31,482
Yes, praise me!

939
01:06:31,620 --> 01:06:36,216
For I am so much greater
than any penguin could ever be!

940
01:06:36,659 --> 01:06:38,422
Rico, set the sights a little higher.

941
01:06:41,830 --> 01:06:44,765
- I have been meloned!
- All hail the king.

942
01:07:09,597 --> 01:07:10,757
What?!

943
01:07:11,165 --> 01:07:12,393
Wait a min...

944
01:07:19,107 --> 01:07:22,133
Forgive me, Rico.
Just testing out my latest invention.

945
01:07:22,277 --> 01:07:25,144
It translates thoughts into action!

946
01:07:27,081 --> 01:07:29,777
And I call it... The Helmet!

947
01:07:29,918 --> 01:07:31,510
The Helmet? Really?

948
01:07:31,653 --> 01:07:34,645
It's a working title.
I'm totally open to suggestions.

949
01:07:34,789 --> 01:07:37,952
The point is,
this proves once and for all

950
01:07:38,092 --> 01:07:40,754
that intellect is stronger
than brute force.

951
01:07:46,100 --> 01:07:49,501
Interesting point, Rico. However...

952
01:07:57,779 --> 01:08:00,407
Now, there's no need to squabble, boys.

953
01:08:00,548 --> 01:08:03,745
Intellect and brute force
are both important to this team.

954
01:08:03,885 --> 01:08:05,512
Mostly brute force.

955
01:08:05,954 --> 01:08:09,014
Look at me! I'm flying!

956
01:08:10,625 --> 01:08:13,253
Not bad, if we need to do air recon.

957
01:08:13,394 --> 01:08:14,588
What else is it good for?

958
01:08:27,108 --> 01:08:30,635
And don't get me started on his cooking!

959
01:08:30,778 --> 01:08:33,975
Maurice's cooking was so bad...

960
01:08:35,450 --> 01:08:39,386
- How bad was it?
- It was so bad, I wouldn't eat it.

961
01:08:40,855 --> 01:08:43,949
That's so funny because it's you!

962
01:08:46,461 --> 01:08:50,921
- This ain't worth a two-mango minimum.
- But seriously, folks...

963
01:08:52,634 --> 01:08:54,693
Now, that's funny!

964
01:08:55,003 --> 01:08:55,992
Do it again!

965
01:08:58,339 --> 01:09:00,170
Nice, Kowalski.

966
01:09:02,944 --> 01:09:07,313
That penguin has a magic crown
that makes things go floating.

967
01:09:07,448 --> 01:09:11,145
Maurice, why does my crown
not do such magic?

968
01:09:11,285 --> 01:09:13,048
Well, how do you know it doesn't?

969
01:09:14,022 --> 01:09:16,047
Good point. OK.

970
01:09:16,190 --> 01:09:20,149
- Fly, Mort, into the sun!
- Oh, yay!

971
01:09:23,197 --> 01:09:25,028
This crown is so lame!

972
01:09:30,471 --> 01:09:33,099
Hello, penguins.
I could not help but notice

973
01:09:33,241 --> 01:09:36,574
that you have a hat
that magically brings things.

974
01:09:36,711 --> 01:09:38,178
And we want it.

975
01:09:40,348 --> 01:09:41,337
Kowalski.

976
01:09:47,388 --> 01:09:51,347
I am consumed by jealousy!
I must have that magic hat!

977
01:09:58,733 --> 01:10:01,133
Maurice, a little more.

978
01:10:16,417 --> 01:10:18,351
Come on!

979
01:10:34,902 --> 01:10:36,961
Now, Maurice.

980
01:10:45,847 --> 01:10:48,645
- The Helmet!
- It's missing!

981
01:10:51,152 --> 01:10:53,814
- Oh, good golly.
- Hello.

982
01:10:53,955 --> 01:10:55,422
Didn't see you there.

983
01:10:55,556 --> 01:10:57,854
How are you liking my new crown?

984
01:10:57,992 --> 01:10:59,254
Quite fetching, yes?

985
01:11:00,094 --> 01:11:03,962
Careful! You have no idea of the
awesome power you now wield.

986
01:11:04,098 --> 01:11:06,931
Of course I do. That's why I took it.

987
01:11:07,068 --> 01:11:11,129
I am the king, and only the king
can wield such awesome power.

988
01:11:11,272 --> 01:11:13,263
Now, watch as I wield.

989
01:11:13,407 --> 01:11:16,638
I want a fizzy soda.

990
01:11:18,780 --> 01:11:21,078
And a candied bar.

991
01:11:23,351 --> 01:11:25,876
And now, I am wanting Chinese food.

992
01:11:30,591 --> 01:11:34,083
No. Real Chinese food from the China.

993
01:11:39,500 --> 01:11:41,127
What is taking so long?

994
01:11:41,269 --> 01:11:42,634
Work, crown, work!

995
01:11:42,770 --> 01:11:44,499
No! Don't touch that.

996
01:11:45,506 --> 01:11:46,564
You'll overload...

997
01:11:47,108 --> 01:11:49,702
You're interrupting my concentration.

998
01:11:49,844 --> 01:11:51,471
Now, where is my lo mein?

999
01:11:51,612 --> 01:11:54,740
Food coming from China
does have a long way to travel.

1000
01:11:54,882 --> 01:11:57,112
Good point, Maurice. Thank you.

1001
01:11:57,251 --> 01:11:58,718
Also, you are fired.

1002
01:11:58,853 --> 01:12:01,879
- What?!
- My brain and my crown thingamabob

1003
01:12:02,023 --> 01:12:05,891
- will do everything for me.
- Yay, King Julien!

1004
01:12:06,027 --> 01:12:09,394
Except the worshipping,
which Mort will do.

1005
01:12:09,530 --> 01:12:11,794
Yay, job security!

1006
01:12:13,434 --> 01:12:15,994
- You're still here.
- Wait!

1007
01:12:16,137 --> 01:12:20,335
Turn over The Helmet, Ringtail,
before someone gets hurt.

1008
01:12:20,474 --> 01:12:24,376
- Kowalski, tell him.
- I... I will, just as soon as I...

1009
01:12:24,512 --> 01:12:26,707
...get the Mort fur off my...

1010
01:12:26,848 --> 01:12:28,145
...tongue.

1011
01:12:29,050 --> 01:12:32,451
You have no idea of the forces
you are playing with.

1012
01:12:35,356 --> 01:12:37,984
He's turned The Helmet's
control regulator up to ten.

1013
01:12:38,125 --> 01:12:39,592
I kept it at a cool five.

1014
01:12:39,727 --> 01:12:42,025
Easy enough
for my accelerated brain capacity,

1015
01:12:42,163 --> 01:12:46,099
but ten is way too much for Julien's
extremely limited mind.

1016
01:12:46,567 --> 01:12:48,728
And that means... what, exactly?

1017
01:12:48,870 --> 01:12:52,203
Oh, just that his chaotic thoughts
will destroy us all.

1018
01:12:52,340 --> 01:12:55,104
Kowalski, have you
ever invented anything

1019
01:12:55,243 --> 01:12:57,905
that doesn't eventually
threaten to destroy us all?

1020
01:12:58,045 --> 01:13:00,912
Let me think... No.

1021
01:13:03,885 --> 01:13:07,514
What next? I know. Papaya!

1022
01:13:09,190 --> 01:13:11,055
Dice. See, Mort?

1023
01:13:11,192 --> 01:13:14,753
- There's nothing I cannot do.
- You are the greatest!

1024
01:13:14,896 --> 01:13:17,456
Except kiss up to my own heinie.

1025
01:13:17,598 --> 01:13:19,896
Very good, Mort. Perfect.

1026
01:13:20,034 --> 01:13:21,763
You, be gone.

1027
01:13:25,806 --> 01:13:28,070
You're trying to steal my crown!

1028
01:13:28,209 --> 01:13:31,940
No, it's a helmet.
And yes, we're stealing it. Back.

1029
01:13:32,680 --> 01:13:36,275
I am surrounded by the
low-down, dirty snakes.

1030
01:13:37,018 --> 01:13:39,111
Figure of speech. Go away!

1031
01:13:39,253 --> 01:13:43,314
You must exercise caution. Whatever
you think of will come right to you.

1032
01:13:43,457 --> 01:13:45,652
Your brain can't handle
that kind of power!

1033
01:13:45,793 --> 01:13:50,321
I was handling it just fine
until you came charging in here

1034
01:13:50,464 --> 01:13:52,694
like a herd of angry rhino!

1035
01:13:56,003 --> 01:14:00,235
At least I didn't say
"Like a herd of angry elephants. "

1036
01:14:02,543 --> 01:14:07,139
OK, OK. But at least
I didn't say "A city bus. "

1037
01:14:08,950 --> 01:14:11,646
OK. I see what I did there.

1038
01:14:11,786 --> 01:14:14,277
- But at least I didn't say...
- Nothing.

1039
01:14:14,422 --> 01:14:17,721
You didn't say nothing,
and you didn't think nothing.

1040
01:14:17,858 --> 01:14:21,692
Despite Skipper's double negatives,
I trust our point is becoming clear.

1041
01:14:23,965 --> 01:14:26,729
You know, my old crown
was much less dangerous.

1042
01:14:26,867 --> 01:14:29,563
So why don't you take this crown off?

1043
01:14:29,704 --> 01:14:34,073
Yes, and do so carefully. This is
a particularly explosive situation.

1044
01:14:34,208 --> 01:14:36,699
- Explosive?
- Oh, heck.

1045
01:14:36,844 --> 01:14:38,141
Hit the deck!

1046
01:14:40,548 --> 01:14:44,075
- He's grabbing some good altitude.
- I wonder if King Julien will realize

1047
01:14:44,218 --> 01:14:47,016
he can use The Helmet's power
to summon a parachute.

1048
01:14:48,656 --> 01:14:50,351
Nope. Ringtail!

1049
01:14:50,491 --> 01:14:54,791
- Take off that helmet ASAP!
- OK, OK. I'll take it off.

1050
01:14:55,796 --> 01:14:58,993
I mean, it's not like this crown
is chained to my head.

1051
01:15:00,234 --> 01:15:02,668
OK, now I am feeling the stupidness.

1052
01:15:05,206 --> 01:15:07,265
- Help!
- Let's roll.

1053
01:15:11,712 --> 01:15:15,910
OK, Ringtail.
Do not think of anything,

1054
01:15:16,050 --> 01:15:19,042
except for me telling you
not to think of anything.

1055
01:15:19,186 --> 01:15:22,155
I won't! My brain will
allow no thoughts in.

1056
01:15:22,289 --> 01:15:24,849
My brain will be a brick wall.

1057
01:15:27,795 --> 01:15:28,784
Rico!

1058
01:15:38,372 --> 01:15:40,670
You know,
I thought those would look cool.

1059
01:15:40,808 --> 01:15:42,332
And they do!

1060
01:15:45,846 --> 01:15:47,746
The Helmet is overwhelming his brain.

1061
01:15:58,092 --> 01:15:59,081
Retreat!

1062
01:16:01,729 --> 01:16:04,357
Skipper, I don't see
any way of penetrating

1063
01:16:04,498 --> 01:16:06,398
that wall of telekinetic chaos.

1064
01:16:06,534 --> 01:16:11,096
Nobody can stop Julien's brain
from destroying the entire world.

1065
01:16:11,238 --> 01:16:12,466
Look!

1066
01:16:14,308 --> 01:16:16,003
Your Highness, I am here to help.

1067
01:16:17,645 --> 01:16:19,977
- And you are...?
- Maurice!

1068
01:16:21,449 --> 01:16:23,314
I used to work for you.

1069
01:16:23,451 --> 01:16:25,885
As recently as this afternoon.

1070
01:16:26,020 --> 01:16:29,251
Now that you mention it,
your face does ring a bell.

1071
01:16:31,258 --> 01:16:34,819
Maurice! What have I done?

1072
01:16:35,963 --> 01:16:37,055
Duck!

1073
01:16:39,533 --> 01:16:41,524
He's distracted. Now's our chance!

1074
01:16:41,669 --> 01:16:44,661
Skipper, I have a careful,
well thought-out plan of attack.

1075
01:16:44,805 --> 01:16:46,238
Rico?

1076
01:16:52,947 --> 01:16:55,040
Maurice, you are alive!

1077
01:16:55,182 --> 01:16:57,207
I thought I had lost you.

1078
01:16:57,351 --> 01:16:59,376
No, but you did lose your hair.

1079
01:16:59,520 --> 01:17:00,953
I lost my...?

1080
01:17:02,590 --> 01:17:05,218
This is hideous! This...

1081
01:17:05,359 --> 01:17:07,657
I am as hairless as a chimp's bottom!

1082
01:17:07,795 --> 01:17:10,457
Chill. I got it covered.

1083
01:17:12,266 --> 01:17:16,066
Maurice, you always know
just what I need.

1084
01:17:16,203 --> 01:17:17,670
Yep.

1085
01:17:18,339 --> 01:17:20,899
Chinese Chinese food is here,
Your Majesty.

1086
01:17:21,041 --> 01:17:23,305
Yummy! Let's chow!

1087
01:17:23,444 --> 01:17:28,143
Well done, Rico.
Good old brute force to the rescue.

1088
01:17:29,049 --> 01:17:31,347
Not entirely. After all, Skipper,

1089
01:17:31,485 --> 01:17:35,148
it was my intellect that reasoned
it was time for brute force.

1090
01:17:35,289 --> 01:17:37,189
Right, Kowalski, right.

1091
01:17:37,324 --> 01:17:40,191
Intellect, brute force,
they're equally important.

1092
01:17:40,327 --> 01:17:43,296
Not really.
Give me brute force any day.

1093
01:17:43,430 --> 01:17:46,399
But, Skipper, doesn't violence
beget more violence?

1094
01:17:46,534 --> 01:17:49,002
It sure does, Private.
It's a win-win.

1095
01:18:02,823 --> 01:18:05,986
I'm jumpy! Maurice, call me Jumpy.

1096
01:18:06,127 --> 01:18:09,494
Love to, Mort,
but I've got a bajillion royal duties.

1097
01:18:10,164 --> 01:18:12,428
- You said doodies!
- No.

1098
01:18:12,566 --> 01:18:16,093
Things I gotta do for the king, "duty. "

1099
01:18:16,771 --> 01:18:22,471
- It's still funny! Now, be jumpy!
- All right, maybe just one bounce.

1100
01:18:26,847 --> 01:18:28,576
I knew that was a bad idea.

1101
01:18:30,050 --> 01:18:32,177
Oh, no. He's not going to...

1102
01:18:32,319 --> 01:18:33,684
No way. The throne!

1103
01:18:45,132 --> 01:18:46,292
I'll get the glue.

1104
01:18:46,433 --> 01:18:47,798
- To eat?
- No!

1105
01:18:50,404 --> 01:18:53,931
All right. Give the glue
a few hours to set, and we're golden.

1106
01:18:54,074 --> 01:18:58,170
Just make sure King Julien
stays away from his throne.

1107
01:18:58,312 --> 01:18:59,779
- OK?
- OK.

1108
01:18:59,914 --> 01:19:03,213
Honeys, I'm home!

1109
01:19:03,350 --> 01:19:05,580
- Who missed me?
- I did!

1110
01:19:06,821 --> 01:19:08,015
Someone else this time.

1111
01:19:08,155 --> 01:19:11,613
Hey! How was your royal walkabout,
Your Highness?

1112
01:19:11,759 --> 01:19:17,095
Maurice, this zoo is full
of so many fantastical things.

1113
01:19:17,231 --> 01:19:21,565
Did you know, for example,
free gum under all the benches.

1114
01:19:21,702 --> 01:19:24,000
Watch, I'm going to blow a bubble.

1115
01:19:27,675 --> 01:19:28,767
You can keep that.

1116
01:19:28,909 --> 01:19:31,605
Now, what to do
with the rest of my day?

1117
01:19:31,745 --> 01:19:33,406
You could sit on your throne.

1118
01:19:34,548 --> 01:19:37,016
- I take that back.
- Or you can go swimming,

1119
01:19:37,151 --> 01:19:38,948
or bouncing, or dancing.

1120
01:19:39,086 --> 01:19:41,714
<i>Work it, work it
Work it /ike you mean it</i>

1121
01:19:42,723 --> 01:19:45,453
I do mean it, but right now,

1122
01:19:45,593 --> 01:19:48,653
mostly because Mort
stuck the idea into my brain,

1123
01:19:48,796 --> 01:19:51,731
I'd like to sit on my throne.

1124
01:19:52,466 --> 01:19:55,401
- No, Your Majesty, don't!
- Don't what, Maurice?

1125
01:19:56,871 --> 01:19:59,738
Don't... don't let me keep you
from sitting on your throne,

1126
01:19:59,874 --> 01:20:04,174
which is rock-solid and not breaking,
or anything like...

1127
01:20:05,279 --> 01:20:09,807
Why is my booty unable
to find my throne sweet part?

1128
01:20:11,151 --> 01:20:12,379
My throne!

1129
01:20:12,519 --> 01:20:17,286
It's all broken and cracked
and broken!

1130
01:20:17,424 --> 01:20:20,518
Who broke the royal throne?

1131
01:20:22,263 --> 01:20:25,289
It was an old throne. Creaky.

1132
01:20:25,432 --> 01:20:28,367
Maybe just broke on its own.
Who can say?

1133
01:20:28,502 --> 01:20:30,231
I can. We did it.

1134
01:20:31,572 --> 01:20:34,336
- So it was you two.
- Yes, but it was an accident.

1135
01:20:34,475 --> 01:20:37,376
An accident you did on purpose.

1136
01:20:37,511 --> 01:20:39,502
This I cannot be believing.

1137
01:20:39,647 --> 01:20:44,584
I ask so very little from you.
But here, you two willy-nillies

1138
01:20:44,718 --> 01:20:48,484
go and ruin the most
precious symbol of my power.

1139
01:20:48,622 --> 01:20:52,217
- Isn't that your crown?
- A king can have many power symbols.

1140
01:20:52,359 --> 01:20:54,452
I see now what must be done.

1141
01:20:55,062 --> 01:20:58,930
OK, this half of the kingdom is for me
and my king things,

1142
01:20:59,066 --> 01:21:01,193
and that half is for you.

1143
01:21:01,335 --> 01:21:04,327
- This is a lot less than half.
- I like it.

1144
01:21:04,471 --> 01:21:06,462
Well, of course it is smaller, Maurice.

1145
01:21:06,607 --> 01:21:09,075
There is only one of me and two of you.

1146
01:21:09,209 --> 01:21:12,042
That means we should have more,
and you should have less.

1147
01:21:12,179 --> 01:21:15,205
The king never has less, that's the law.

1148
01:21:15,349 --> 01:21:17,715
So I take it we're
not allowed in your half?

1149
01:21:17,851 --> 01:21:21,218
- Got that right, mister.
- And you won't come into our half?

1150
01:21:21,355 --> 01:21:23,414
Why would I want to? It's so tiny.

1151
01:21:23,557 --> 01:21:25,821
You know what? Sounds jim-dandy.

1152
01:21:25,960 --> 01:21:28,520
Mort and I are going to
have a good time here.

1153
01:21:28,662 --> 01:21:30,129
But I...

1154
01:21:30,664 --> 01:21:35,363
Yeah. We're going to hang here,
kick back, maybe have a party.

1155
01:21:35,502 --> 01:21:37,993
- Do you want to have a party?
- Can we invite King Julien?

1156
01:21:38,138 --> 01:21:41,073
- No!
- Oh, OK...

1157
01:21:41,208 --> 01:21:43,676
Frankly, you two
were giving my style the cramps.

1158
01:21:43,811 --> 01:21:46,371
I can have fun all by myself.

1159
01:21:52,286 --> 01:21:54,220
You're it. No, you're it.

1160
01:21:54,355 --> 01:21:57,119
You're it, no touchbacks.
No, I'm not, because I'm on base.

1161
01:21:57,257 --> 01:22:00,488
There's no base. There is for the king.
The king is never it.

1162
01:22:00,627 --> 01:22:03,152
OK, I can't argue with that logic.

1163
01:22:05,933 --> 01:22:07,059
Well, this stinks.

1164
01:22:07,868 --> 01:22:09,927
Hello, friendly penguins.

1165
01:22:12,072 --> 01:22:15,803
I was wondering if you could
make this melon split open for me.

1166
01:22:15,943 --> 01:22:17,604
Rico, slice.

1167
01:22:18,679 --> 01:22:22,342
There you go, Ringtail.
Service with a psycho smile.

1168
01:22:23,684 --> 01:22:26,084
Yes, OK, thank you.

1169
01:22:27,054 --> 01:22:28,043
One more thing.

1170
01:22:28,188 --> 01:22:32,124
Could you also let me boss you around,
you know, just a little?

1171
01:22:32,259 --> 01:22:36,491
- No, next question.
- Please! I have nobody to browbeat.

1172
01:22:36,630 --> 01:22:38,791
Mort and Maurice have left me.

1173
01:22:38,932 --> 01:22:42,060
- They left you?
- Yes, right after I kicked them out.

1174
01:22:42,202 --> 01:22:44,796
And now I am so lonely.

1175
01:22:44,938 --> 01:22:47,338
You know, my uncle Nigel always said,

1176
01:22:47,474 --> 01:22:50,409
"On a voyage of life
the best boat is a friendship. "

1177
01:22:51,712 --> 01:22:53,304
Are we going boating?

1178
01:22:53,447 --> 01:22:56,939
Who needs Maurice and Mort when
my new bestest friends have a yacht?

1179
01:22:57,084 --> 01:22:58,949
I think what Private's saying

1180
01:22:59,086 --> 01:23:03,682
is that Maurice and Mort
are your bestest friends. Not us.

1181
01:23:03,824 --> 01:23:07,123
Maurice and Mort do not have a boat.
Who needs them?

1182
01:23:07,261 --> 01:23:08,421
- You need them.
- Who?

1183
01:23:08,562 --> 01:23:10,120
- Maurice and Mort.
- No.

1184
01:23:10,264 --> 01:23:12,596
They are a little too boatless
for my taste.

1185
01:23:12,733 --> 01:23:15,759
Forget about the boat! You need
to patch things up with your pals.

1186
01:23:16,837 --> 01:23:19,670
Nothing could possibly, ever

1187
01:23:19,807 --> 01:23:23,038
make me want to be
anywhere near them.

1188
01:23:28,015 --> 01:23:31,280
My booty senses nearby
moving and grooving.

1189
01:23:34,455 --> 01:23:38,016
- Burt. Yeah, you're on the list.
- In you go, my friend.

1190
01:23:38,158 --> 01:23:41,992
Awesome! Make way
for the party pachyderm.

1191
01:23:44,765 --> 01:23:48,098
- Where's the peanuts?
- Down the hall, on the left.

1192
01:23:48,235 --> 01:23:49,793
Thank you.

1193
01:23:49,937 --> 01:23:51,996
How'd they get a
whole elephant in that shed?

1194
01:23:52,139 --> 01:23:54,664
- It's roomier than it looks.
- A party!

1195
01:23:54,808 --> 01:23:57,470
Make way for the party king, man.

1196
01:23:57,611 --> 01:24:00,774
Hold on there, chief, we gotta see
if your name's on the guest list.

1197
01:24:00,914 --> 01:24:03,781
Party King? Nah, not on the list.

1198
01:24:03,917 --> 01:24:06,715
- Hold on, I got a King Julien.
- Yeah, that's me.

1199
01:24:06,854 --> 01:24:09,482
Yeah, you're on the
"absolutely not a guest" list.

1200
01:24:09,623 --> 01:24:14,151
What? This must be
some kind of missed stake.

1201
01:24:14,294 --> 01:24:17,229
It's no mistake. We'd love
for you to come, wouldn't we, Mort?

1202
01:24:17,364 --> 01:24:19,491
- Love!
- But you said that we're

1203
01:24:19,633 --> 01:24:22,693
supposed to stay on our half,
and you on yours.

1204
01:24:22,836 --> 01:24:25,270
My hands are tied. You understand.

1205
01:24:30,210 --> 01:24:32,940
Don't give me those sad eyes.
He started it.

1206
01:24:33,714 --> 01:24:37,445
They... do not want me at their party.

1207
01:24:37,584 --> 01:24:40,212
This is an outrageousness!

1208
01:24:40,354 --> 01:24:45,223
I shall throw my own party,
and my many friends will be coming.

1209
01:24:45,359 --> 01:24:49,056
- Right, my many friends?
- All right.

1210
01:24:49,730 --> 01:24:52,893
OK, everybody,
let's start the party games.

1211
01:24:53,033 --> 01:24:55,558
I'll make balloon animals.

1212
01:24:57,604 --> 01:24:59,663
This one is an earthworm.

1213
01:25:01,441 --> 01:25:02,738
Tapeworm.

1214
01:25:03,810 --> 01:25:05,175
And look, a hookworm.

1215
01:25:07,714 --> 01:25:08,806
Make that a flatworm.

1216
01:25:09,883 --> 01:25:11,783
- Wow, look at the time.
- Early wake up tomorrow.

1217
01:25:11,919 --> 01:25:16,288
We've got to... you know,
do something, penguin stuff.

1218
01:25:16,423 --> 01:25:17,947
You do not have to lie.

1219
01:25:18,091 --> 01:25:20,389
No one loves me!

1220
01:25:20,527 --> 01:25:23,621
- Now, that's not...
- As much as I love me.

1221
01:25:23,764 --> 01:25:25,095
OK, yeah, that's true.

1222
01:25:25,232 --> 01:25:29,430
Look at me. I cannot even
throw a proper shindig.

1223
01:25:29,570 --> 01:25:33,404
Yeah, OK...
Well, thanks for having us.

1224
01:25:34,675 --> 01:25:36,575
It was a real treat.

1225
01:25:38,445 --> 01:25:39,810
Bye, now.

1226
01:25:42,549 --> 01:25:46,076
Ringtail, you're playing my
heartstrings like a big bow fiddle.

1227
01:25:46,220 --> 01:25:50,418
Maybe you can't throw a party.
Or maybe you just need a little help.

1228
01:25:50,557 --> 01:25:53,355
Men, commence Operation Hootenanny.

1229
01:25:59,633 --> 01:26:04,093
Turntables are up to maximum speed.
This party is a go!

1230
01:26:04,238 --> 01:26:07,435
- The only thing left is the guest list.
- Leave that to me.

1231
01:26:07,574 --> 01:26:09,064
I am connected.

1232
01:26:09,209 --> 01:26:11,200
But everyone's still at
Mort and Maurice's.

1233
01:26:11,812 --> 01:26:15,976
I have many friends.
They will not be letting me down.

1234
01:26:16,116 --> 01:26:18,880
Everybody, party!

1235
01:26:21,021 --> 01:26:24,013
Who will start the conga-ga line?
Me? Okey-dokey.

1236
01:26:24,157 --> 01:26:28,150
- When you said you had friends...
- We thought you meant real friends.

1237
01:26:28,295 --> 01:26:30,320
But they are real friends.

1238
01:26:30,464 --> 01:26:33,729
Janice here wants to be
a dental technician.

1239
01:26:33,867 --> 01:26:37,234
But Emil thinks she isn't suited for it.

1240
01:26:37,371 --> 01:26:40,772
How can you crush
Janice's dreams, Emil?!

1241
01:26:42,609 --> 01:26:46,841
Yes, I'm sorry, Emil.
You're right, we should get along.

1242
01:26:46,980 --> 01:26:50,438
That's what friends do: Get along.
Not fight.

1243
01:26:54,988 --> 01:26:57,218
You need to see this. Bring Sad Eyes.

1244
01:26:58,859 --> 01:27:02,056
Please, enjoy the hors d'oeuvres.

1245
01:27:02,195 --> 01:27:06,222
None of this
"No, thanks, I'm stuffed" nonsense.

1246
01:27:06,366 --> 01:27:09,199
Rosalita, you made it!

1247
01:27:11,104 --> 01:27:13,834
Rosalita, you naughty girl.

1248
01:27:13,974 --> 01:27:17,535
You simply must, must dance with me.

1249
01:27:17,678 --> 01:27:20,408
The king. He's... He's...

1250
01:27:20,547 --> 01:27:23,038
- Stark, raving mad.
- And crazy, too.

1251
01:27:23,183 --> 01:27:25,515
Without friends,
his delicate psyche snapped.

1252
01:27:25,652 --> 01:27:29,110
Like Snappiest Snap person,
the snappingest kid in Snapadelphia.

1253
01:27:29,256 --> 01:27:32,089
Son of Snap Snap person,
snap photography specialist and...

1254
01:27:32,225 --> 01:27:34,386
- Rico.
- Thanks.

1255
01:27:36,496 --> 01:27:39,932
I just wanted to teach him a lesson.
I didn't want this.

1256
01:27:40,067 --> 01:27:42,467
He needs you, Maurice,
more than you ever knew.

1257
01:27:45,806 --> 01:27:49,139
- Come on, Mort. We're going home.
- Yay!

1258
01:27:52,446 --> 01:27:55,779
Mort, Maurice!
You came to my party?

1259
01:27:55,916 --> 01:27:58,885
- We thought it might be fun.
- Splendulous!

1260
01:27:59,019 --> 01:28:01,613
But are you on the guest list?

1261
01:28:04,057 --> 01:28:07,151
Oh, OK, I get it.
You want me to beg.

1262
01:28:07,294 --> 01:28:09,023
- Well, forget...
- Wait!

1263
01:28:09,162 --> 01:28:11,960
Don't go. You are on the list.

1264
01:28:12,099 --> 01:28:14,090
Look. See?

1265
01:28:14,234 --> 01:28:16,464
There you are. And that is me.

1266
01:28:16,603 --> 01:28:19,037
And nobody cares
that you broke my throne,

1267
01:28:19,172 --> 01:28:21,640
because we're all friends again.

1268
01:28:23,143 --> 01:28:25,941
Yeah, OK. I guess we are.

1269
01:28:26,079 --> 01:28:29,879
Huzzah! Welcome to my party, Maurice.

1270
01:28:30,016 --> 01:28:33,645
I want you to be considering
my side of the stripe,

1271
01:28:33,787 --> 01:28:35,778
your side of the stripe.

1272
01:28:36,123 --> 01:28:37,112
Yey!

1273
01:28:39,793 --> 01:28:42,353
Now, please, come meet Janice.

1274
01:28:42,496 --> 01:28:45,090
She wants to be a dental technician.

1275
01:28:45,232 --> 01:28:49,134
And this is Emil.
He wants to crush Janice's dreams.

1276
01:28:49,269 --> 01:28:51,635
It's good those freaks have each other.
