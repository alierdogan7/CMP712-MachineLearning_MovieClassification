1
00:04:32,373 --> 00:04:34,011
Joe, you're under arrest.

2
00:04:34,293 --> 00:04:36,761
Maybe so, but don't turn around, Sheriff.

3
00:04:37,333 --> 00:04:39,244
Now what're you going to do, Sheriff?.

4
00:04:47,573 --> 00:04:49,723
You can do just about what you want.

5
00:04:52,773 --> 00:04:54,684
Anybody else you want besides Joe?

6
00:04:57,213 --> 00:04:58,009
No.

7
00:04:59,413 --> 00:05:00,687
Give me a hand.

8
00:05:48,893 --> 00:05:50,884
-What is all this?
-Hello, Mr. Wheeler.

9
00:05:50,973 --> 00:05:53,931
Tell your men to stay with the wagons
till they're told different.

10
00:05:54,013 --> 00:05:56,402
Who the devil do you think you're ordering
around here?

11
00:05:56,493 --> 00:05:59,724
First Burdette's men stop me
and now you stand there and try....

12
00:06:00,893 --> 00:06:04,169
-Say, seems like I ought to know you.
-Think you do, Mr. Wheeler.

13
00:06:04,613 --> 00:06:06,524
Yeah, I remember you now.

14
00:06:07,133 --> 00:06:09,931
That star you're wearing
kind of threw me off for a minute.

15
00:06:10,013 --> 00:06:13,050
Aren't you the fellow
the Mexicans used to call borrachin?

16
00:06:13,693 --> 00:06:16,002
That's nearly right. Only it's borrachon.

17
00:06:16,093 --> 00:06:18,891
I don't think I've ever seen you
like this before.

18
00:06:19,653 --> 00:06:22,326
You mean sober? You're probably right.

19
00:06:22,413 --> 00:06:24,005
You know what borrachon means?

20
00:06:24,093 --> 00:06:25,970
My Spanish ain't too good.

21
00:06:26,053 --> 00:06:27,532
It means drunk.

22
00:06:27,933 --> 00:06:30,970
Now if the name bothers you,
they used to call me "Dude."

23
00:06:31,453 --> 00:06:33,728
Now are you going
to tell your men or do l?

24
00:06:34,373 --> 00:06:35,931
I'll tell my men.

25
00:06:41,213 --> 00:06:43,363
Stand by the wagons, everybody!

26
00:06:43,893 --> 00:06:45,087
Pass the word.

27
00:07:16,093 --> 00:07:17,731
Chance, what's going on here?

28
00:07:17,813 --> 00:07:20,930
People stopping me. Everybody telling me
what I can and can't do.

29
00:07:21,013 --> 00:07:23,129
Next thing, you'll be telling me what to do.

30
00:07:23,213 --> 00:07:24,805
-Pat, I will tell you.
-What?

31
00:07:24,893 --> 00:07:27,248
-Stop your wagons.
-I give up.

32
00:07:31,173 --> 00:07:34,848
Now don't tell me what's going on.
Just leave me wandering around in the fog.

33
00:07:34,933 --> 00:07:37,766
I like it. I'm getting used to it.
It makes me feel so good.

34
00:07:37,853 --> 00:07:40,447
You better look out, Pat,
you'll blow up and bust.

35
00:07:40,533 --> 00:07:43,684
Listen, Chance, remember me?
Your old friend Pat Wheeler.

36
00:07:43,773 --> 00:07:45,764
-Now, will you please--
-Hey, Chance!

37
00:07:45,853 --> 00:07:49,289
What do you want to do about this outfit?
Do you want to take their guns?

38
00:07:49,373 --> 00:07:50,886
Got any new men with you, Pat?

39
00:07:50,973 --> 00:07:53,203
No, nobody except Colorado here.

40
00:07:53,893 --> 00:07:55,804
-Where'd you take him on?
-Fort Worth.

41
00:07:55,893 --> 00:07:58,453
-What does he do?
-I speak English, Sheriff...

42
00:07:58,653 --> 00:08:00,371
...if you want to ask me.

43
00:08:03,613 --> 00:08:05,763
All right, buster, what do you do?

44
00:08:06,653 --> 00:08:08,132
I'm riding guard.

45
00:08:08,253 --> 00:08:10,130
Pretty young for that, aren't you?

46
00:08:10,213 --> 00:08:12,602
Just how old do you have to be, Sheriff?.

47
00:08:13,373 --> 00:08:15,364
You remember Ryan from Denver,
don't you?

48
00:08:15,453 --> 00:08:16,602
Rocky Ryan?

49
00:08:16,733 --> 00:08:18,212
That's his boy.

50
00:08:18,493 --> 00:08:20,848
He tells me the kid's faster than he was.

51
00:08:20,973 --> 00:08:23,885
He better be, packing a pair of guns.

52
00:08:24,253 --> 00:08:28,644
Now, Sheriff, if it's the two guns that
bother you, I could give you one of them.

53
00:08:28,773 --> 00:08:30,445
I could let you have them both.

54
00:08:30,533 --> 00:08:32,569
They wouldn't do me too much good.

55
00:08:32,653 --> 00:08:35,486
That fellow in the door there
has a shotgun on me.

56
00:08:35,693 --> 00:08:39,208
-Stumpy, didn't I tell--
-I know. I'm going. I'm going.

57
00:08:42,653 --> 00:08:44,609
You can keep your guns, Colorado.

58
00:08:44,693 --> 00:08:47,412
Thanks, Sheriff. I don't want any trouble.

59
00:08:47,693 --> 00:08:49,206
Well, then don't start any.

60
00:08:49,293 --> 00:08:51,602
I won't, unless I tell you first.

61
00:08:51,973 --> 00:08:53,452
That's good enough.

62
00:08:53,573 --> 00:08:56,087
Pat, you can put your wagons
in that corral.

63
00:08:56,213 --> 00:08:57,771
I ought to do just that.

64
00:08:57,853 --> 00:09:00,321
-What?
-I'm just guessing, you understand.

65
00:09:00,693 --> 00:09:03,366
It seems to me that you've already got
some trouble here.

66
00:09:03,453 --> 00:09:04,727
You're guessing right.

67
00:09:04,813 --> 00:09:08,567
It so happens that part of our load
there is fuel oil and dynamite.

68
00:09:08,653 --> 00:09:11,008
Would you like to have that
sitting next to you?

69
00:09:11,093 --> 00:09:12,321
No, I wouldn't.

70
00:09:12,413 --> 00:09:14,688
They could put them over there
by the creek.

71
00:09:14,773 --> 00:09:16,604
Near the Burdette warehouse.

72
00:09:16,733 --> 00:09:19,645
If it's going to blow
that's just as good a place as any.

73
00:09:19,773 --> 00:09:21,331
Show them the way, Dude.

74
00:09:21,413 --> 00:09:23,165
You can go along, Colorado.

75
00:09:23,293 --> 00:09:25,727
Is that the way you want it, Mr. Wheeler?

76
00:09:27,613 --> 00:09:28,807
Go ahead.

77
00:09:44,413 --> 00:09:46,881
Let's get out of the middle of the street.

78
00:09:49,693 --> 00:09:53,163
Now that you're satisfied
and that the kid's got his guns...

79
00:09:53,893 --> 00:09:56,930
...would you mind telling me
what this is all about?

80
00:09:57,893 --> 00:09:59,884
We've got Joe Burdette in here.

81
00:10:01,213 --> 00:10:04,410
-Joe Burdette in jail? Nathan's brother?
-That's right.

82
00:10:05,053 --> 00:10:06,850
What are you holding them for?

83
00:10:06,933 --> 00:10:10,050
They were about to bury the reason
when you were coming in.

84
00:10:10,213 --> 00:10:12,568
-Murder?
-No other word for it.

85
00:10:13,213 --> 00:10:15,443
No wonder this town's in such a mess.

86
00:10:16,013 --> 00:10:17,605
What does Nathan say about this?

87
00:10:17,693 --> 00:10:20,810
Nothing. He's not talking. Just doing.

88
00:10:20,893 --> 00:10:22,167
You saw part of it.

89
00:10:22,253 --> 00:10:27,281
He's got this town so bottled up
that I can't get Joe out or any help in.

90
00:10:29,133 --> 00:10:31,249
There are men over there watching us.

91
00:10:31,373 --> 00:10:32,726
They're his.

92
00:10:33,053 --> 00:10:35,726
I can't make a move
without him knowing it.

93
00:10:35,813 --> 00:10:37,451
Who you got helping you?

94
00:10:38,573 --> 00:10:40,291
You met half of them.

95
00:10:40,533 --> 00:10:44,162
You mean that fellow with the badge
that stopped me, and who else?

96
00:10:44,493 --> 00:10:46,723
Stumpy. You know him.

97
00:10:47,133 --> 00:10:49,647
He's watching Joe and guarding the jail.

98
00:10:50,493 --> 00:10:53,929
A game-legged old man and a drunk.
That's all you got?

99
00:10:54,013 --> 00:10:55,605
That's what I got.

100
00:10:56,573 --> 00:11:00,646
If I ever saw a man holding the bull
by the tail, you're it.

101
00:11:02,213 --> 00:11:04,647
It's a good idea putting my wagons
where they're safe.

102
00:11:04,733 --> 00:11:06,689
Guess I better see they did it.

103
00:11:06,773 --> 00:11:08,252
I'll see you later.

104
00:11:20,813 --> 00:11:23,008
Better get back up there
and watch the road.

105
00:11:23,093 --> 00:11:24,606
You don't look so good.

106
00:11:24,813 --> 00:11:26,212
I feel worse.

107
00:11:26,573 --> 00:11:28,325
Think I'll stop off and get a beer.

108
00:11:28,413 --> 00:11:29,892
I thought you would.

109
00:11:30,173 --> 00:11:32,448
Got some in here. Cold.

110
00:11:32,733 --> 00:11:34,485
Just as long as it's beer.

111
00:11:40,733 --> 00:11:43,122
Stumpy, didn't I tell you
to stay out of sight?

112
00:11:43,213 --> 00:11:47,252
There you go. I never can please you.
I was just covering you in case of trouble.

113
00:11:47,333 --> 00:11:51,531
I'd be in more trouble if you'd have gotten
picked off while standing at that door.

114
00:11:51,613 --> 00:11:52,807
You'd be in trouble?

115
00:11:52,893 --> 00:11:54,884
What about me
if somebody gunned me down?

116
00:11:54,973 --> 00:11:56,804
Don't you never think of me?

117
00:11:57,253 --> 00:11:59,562
Dude, I guess we better get used to it.

118
00:11:59,773 --> 00:12:02,606
Here's a fellow don't think of nobody
but himself.

119
00:12:02,733 --> 00:12:04,883
I told you why I want you back in there...

120
00:12:04,973 --> 00:12:08,329
...and you're going to stay there
with that cage locked when I'm not here.

121
00:12:08,413 --> 00:12:09,926
-You hear me?
-I heard you.

122
00:12:10,013 --> 00:12:11,605
Those windows, did you fix them?

123
00:12:11,693 --> 00:12:13,923
Them shutters is nailed up
tighter than a drum.

124
00:12:14,013 --> 00:12:15,492
Nothing could get in here.

125
00:12:15,573 --> 00:12:18,007
-Not even some fresh air.
-That's the way I want it.

126
00:12:18,093 --> 00:12:20,288
You can help to change my life.
Can't help it.

127
00:12:20,373 --> 00:12:24,651
Five, six days breathing the same air
as Burdette might make a killer out of me.

128
00:12:24,733 --> 00:12:27,008
You can hear me back there,
can't you, Joe?

129
00:12:27,093 --> 00:12:30,244
I hear you all right, but I won't have
to listen to you for very long.

130
00:12:30,333 --> 00:12:32,563
Now, Joe, that's gratitude for you.

131
00:12:32,693 --> 00:12:35,605
After me fixing up all your cuts
and bruises like I done.

132
00:12:35,693 --> 00:12:38,127
I hope it happens again.
I won't do it, that's all.

133
00:12:38,213 --> 00:12:39,851
-Shut up!
-I take it back, Joe.

134
00:12:39,933 --> 00:12:42,891
If it does happen again,
I'll do just like I done before...

135
00:12:42,973 --> 00:12:46,010
...only I hope you have
more cuts and bruises to fix.

136
00:12:46,893 --> 00:12:49,361
Hey, Dude. Dude, come here a minute.

137
00:12:50,253 --> 00:12:51,652
What do you want?

138
00:12:51,973 --> 00:12:54,487
Why don't you sit in here
in place of Stumpy?

139
00:12:55,133 --> 00:12:57,442
I'd rather listen to a drunk than him.

140
00:12:58,573 --> 00:13:00,529
How you holding up, borrachon?

141
00:13:01,053 --> 00:13:02,486
Got the shakes yet?

142
00:13:02,933 --> 00:13:07,051
That beer won't do you no good. You'll
have to get something stronger than that.

143
00:13:07,133 --> 00:13:10,091
If you're still broke,
I think I got another dollar.

144
00:13:11,973 --> 00:13:15,124
-Chance, you going to let him do that?
-I'll do better than that.

145
00:13:15,213 --> 00:13:18,444
I'll let him have the key to your cell
anytime he wants it.

146
00:13:22,653 --> 00:13:25,406
It'd be too easy.
He's got nobody to back him up.

147
00:13:26,493 --> 00:13:29,291
If he talks out of turn,
throw a bucket of water on him.

148
00:13:29,373 --> 00:13:32,524
I'll throw one in the middle of his bed
and leave him to sleep in it.

149
00:13:32,613 --> 00:13:34,012
Want another beer?

150
00:13:34,613 --> 00:13:36,444
You kind of wasted some of that last one.

151
00:13:36,533 --> 00:13:38,922
No, it wasn't wasted, except I missed him.

152
00:13:39,533 --> 00:13:42,252
-I don't need any more.
-Hey, in the jail.

153
00:13:46,413 --> 00:13:48,643
That's far enough. What do you want?

154
00:13:48,813 --> 00:13:51,725
Mr. Wheeler said to bring this package
to the Sheriff.

155
00:13:52,013 --> 00:13:55,210
-You expecting a package?
-Be right out.

156
00:13:56,093 --> 00:13:57,731
-Stumpy?
-Yeah?

157
00:13:57,813 --> 00:14:00,088
Going over to the hotel for a few minutes.

158
00:14:00,173 --> 00:14:03,324
If you don't come back,
me and Joe will have us a good cry.

159
00:14:03,533 --> 00:14:05,330
Just keep that door locked.

160
00:14:06,973 --> 00:14:09,123
-Thanks for your trouble.
-No trouble at all.

161
00:14:09,213 --> 00:14:11,488
Wheeler says just be careful coming up.

162
00:14:12,773 --> 00:14:15,241
Looks like our friend's still on the job.

163
00:14:15,573 --> 00:14:16,528
Yeah.

164
00:14:17,133 --> 00:14:19,442
There's another one over by the church.

165
00:14:20,293 --> 00:14:22,011
Any use in arresting them?

166
00:14:22,653 --> 00:14:24,450
For just standing around?

167
00:14:24,573 --> 00:14:26,609
All they'd do is get another one.

168
00:14:26,893 --> 00:14:29,088
The jail isn't big enough
to hold all of them.

169
00:14:29,173 --> 00:14:33,052
As a matter of fact,
they'd like to get a few in jail.

170
00:14:33,173 --> 00:14:34,606
Remember that.

171
00:14:38,733 --> 00:14:41,964
Senor Chance. I've been looking for you.
I have a message for--

172
00:14:42,053 --> 00:14:45,170
-What you have here?
-The package you've been waiting for.

173
00:14:45,253 --> 00:14:47,289
Just in time.

174
00:14:47,613 --> 00:14:50,571
-Carlos! Where you are?
-I'm over here.

175
00:14:50,653 --> 00:14:52,325
You keep it. Consuelo, she comes now.

176
00:14:52,413 --> 00:14:54,881
If you break the dishes,
you'll see what happens.

177
00:14:54,973 --> 00:14:58,045
Every day is the same thing.... Carlos.
Oh Senor Chance.

178
00:14:58,253 --> 00:15:00,084
I just ask Carlos if he's....

179
00:15:00,253 --> 00:15:02,528
Carlos, what is wrong?

180
00:15:03,053 --> 00:15:05,647
You look like the cat
who swallows the chicken.

181
00:15:05,733 --> 00:15:08,770
-What have you been doing?
-What have I been doing?

182
00:15:08,853 --> 00:15:12,243
I've been talking to my friend the sheriff,
that's what I have been doing.

183
00:15:12,333 --> 00:15:13,766
We have important business.

184
00:15:13,853 --> 00:15:16,003
You say I look like the cat
who eats too much.

185
00:15:16,093 --> 00:15:17,811
Consuelo, look at me.

186
00:15:18,013 --> 00:15:18,968
Am I fat?

187
00:15:19,053 --> 00:15:21,965
-I did not say you are fat.
-Please, Consuelo, do not say more.

188
00:15:22,053 --> 00:15:23,691
You already say too much.

189
00:15:23,773 --> 00:15:26,082
Me and my friend
will make our business alone.

190
00:15:26,173 --> 00:15:27,288
Come.

191
00:15:33,093 --> 00:15:35,561
The thing is if he ate the chicken or not.

192
00:15:35,933 --> 00:15:37,161
I'm going to see.

193
00:15:37,853 --> 00:15:39,571
You take chances, my friend.

194
00:15:39,653 --> 00:15:40,972
Because I know woman.

195
00:15:41,053 --> 00:15:43,203
If she will be mad or she will be sorry.

196
00:15:43,293 --> 00:15:45,807
If it is mad,
she will be much pleasure to make right.

197
00:15:45,893 --> 00:15:48,407
And if she is sorry,
it will be the same pleasure.

198
00:15:48,493 --> 00:15:50,290
You do not have women.

199
00:15:50,373 --> 00:15:51,852
So you do not know.

200
00:15:51,933 --> 00:15:54,686
But me, Carlos Remonte, I know.

201
00:15:55,813 --> 00:15:58,373
Wait till I show you
what is in this package.

202
00:15:59,893 --> 00:16:02,407
Then you tell me
if I do not know about women.

203
00:16:03,093 --> 00:16:07,245
If I had bought these myself,
everyone in town would have known.

204
00:16:08,053 --> 00:16:12,604
And it's not the sort of thing that Consuelo
would like to have known by everyone.

205
00:16:17,093 --> 00:16:18,048
You see?

206
00:16:19,613 --> 00:16:21,444
Are they not beautiful?

207
00:16:22,053 --> 00:16:24,487
Can you make the picture
how she will look?

208
00:16:24,613 --> 00:16:26,410
You sure you want me to do that?

209
00:16:26,493 --> 00:16:27,608
No.

210
00:16:28,013 --> 00:16:30,527
Do not make the picture.
It is best for me to do it.

211
00:16:30,613 --> 00:16:33,525
I beg your pardon, gentlemen,
but I'm looking for a....

212
00:16:35,133 --> 00:16:38,170
Those things have great possibilities,
but not for you.

213
00:16:41,013 --> 00:16:42,651
What are you doing here?

214
00:16:43,453 --> 00:16:47,366
Until I saw those things, I was looking
for a towel. I'd like to take a bath.

215
00:16:47,453 --> 00:16:49,921
-Didn't you come in on the stage?
-That's right.

216
00:16:50,013 --> 00:16:51,526
Why aren't you on it?

217
00:16:51,933 --> 00:16:54,527
Whoever heard of a stagecoach
having a bathroom?

218
00:16:54,613 --> 00:16:57,571
Chihuahua, I forgot.
I start to tell you and I forgot.

219
00:16:57,653 --> 00:16:59,371
The stage, she did not go.

220
00:16:59,933 --> 00:17:00,604
Why?

221
00:17:00,693 --> 00:17:03,048
-Something happened with the wheel.
-Where's Jake?

222
00:17:03,133 --> 00:17:05,886
Near the corral.
He must fix the wheel before he can leave.

223
00:17:05,973 --> 00:17:07,326
That's just fine.

224
00:17:10,333 --> 00:17:12,483
Hey, Sheriff, you forgot your pants.

225
00:18:02,293 --> 00:18:04,443
You reckon they'll try anything tonight?

226
00:18:04,533 --> 00:18:07,730
Could be. Nathan Burdette's smart.
Don't underrate him.

227
00:18:07,813 --> 00:18:09,485
That ain't no kind of answer.

228
00:18:09,573 --> 00:18:11,962
How or what he'll do, I don't know.

229
00:18:12,733 --> 00:18:14,405
Your guess is as good as mine.

230
00:18:14,493 --> 00:18:16,404
What I want to know is when.

231
00:18:17,213 --> 00:18:19,169
I wish he'd hurry up and do it.

232
00:18:29,853 --> 00:18:31,525
Have a bottle of beer, Dude?

233
00:18:31,613 --> 00:18:33,365
I'm full of beer.

234
00:18:34,333 --> 00:18:36,164
It doesn't do any good.

235
00:18:36,413 --> 00:18:39,325
It'll start working on you tomorrow
or the next day.

236
00:18:44,653 --> 00:18:45,608
Stumpy.

237
00:18:46,653 --> 00:18:49,167
We're going to take a turn
around the town.

238
00:18:50,173 --> 00:18:52,368
-You be all right?
-'Course I'll be all right.

239
00:18:52,453 --> 00:18:54,205
Then get in there where you belong.

240
00:18:54,293 --> 00:18:56,807
I'm going. But you remember one thing:

241
00:18:57,533 --> 00:19:00,331
When you come back,
you holler before you open that door.

242
00:19:00,413 --> 00:19:02,802
I'm liable to blast you
just for the heck of it.

243
00:19:02,893 --> 00:19:04,087
We'll holler.

244
00:19:11,533 --> 00:19:14,047
You got any particular reason
for going out tonight?

245
00:19:14,133 --> 00:19:15,282
Usually do.

246
00:19:15,493 --> 00:19:19,168
Don't want to do anything different,
they might think we're scared.

247
00:19:19,453 --> 00:19:20,727
Aren't we?

248
00:19:22,453 --> 00:19:24,808
I just can't take it sitting in there.

249
00:19:24,933 --> 00:19:27,083
You mean you saw I couldn't take it.

250
00:19:27,613 --> 00:19:30,081
Don't set yourself up as being so special.

251
00:19:30,653 --> 00:19:32,723
Think you invented the hangover.

252
00:19:33,093 --> 00:19:35,732
I could sure take out a patent for this one.

253
00:19:39,133 --> 00:19:40,407
Take that side.

254
00:20:15,173 --> 00:20:16,367
Good evening.

255
00:21:30,613 --> 00:21:32,410
Hold it, Dude. Stairway.

256
00:21:32,893 --> 00:21:34,451
Don't shoot, Sheriff.

257
00:21:34,573 --> 00:21:36,325
Just getting a little air.

258
00:22:09,253 --> 00:22:10,527
I'm getting jumpy.

259
00:22:10,613 --> 00:22:13,081
I'll walk along with you
and hold your hand.

260
00:22:13,213 --> 00:22:16,011
-Get back over there where you belong.
-Yes, Papa.

261
00:22:29,613 --> 00:22:32,286
-Carlos.
-Senor Chance. I been looking for you.

262
00:22:32,373 --> 00:22:34,409
-It is very bad.
-What's wrong?

263
00:22:34,493 --> 00:22:36,563
-Your friend Senor Wheeler.
-What about him?

264
00:22:36,653 --> 00:22:40,328
He is a good friend
and he wishes good for you, so he talks.

265
00:22:40,413 --> 00:22:42,802
He talks to people. He talk to everybody.

266
00:22:42,933 --> 00:22:46,084
He say why they don't help you,
that you should have some more help.

267
00:22:46,173 --> 00:22:47,811
He's right.

268
00:22:47,893 --> 00:22:50,487
But is no good to say such things
to the wrong people.

269
00:22:50,573 --> 00:22:52,370
-You tell him.
-Is he in there?

270
00:22:52,453 --> 00:22:53,602
Si, I think.

271
00:22:55,453 --> 00:22:57,364
Chance, he's over there.

272
00:22:58,413 --> 00:22:59,641
The kings full.

273
00:22:59,853 --> 00:23:01,650
That's good. Beats me.

274
00:23:09,693 --> 00:23:11,411
Spare a minute, Pat?

275
00:23:11,533 --> 00:23:12,852
Good evening, Sheriff.

276
00:23:12,933 --> 00:23:14,048
Deal me out.

277
00:23:14,133 --> 00:23:15,168
Evening.

278
00:23:25,213 --> 00:23:26,885
You two know each other.

279
00:23:27,133 --> 00:23:28,009
Yeah.

280
00:23:28,253 --> 00:23:29,732
No thanks, Carlos.

281
00:23:30,213 --> 00:23:32,044
I've been wanting to talk to you.

282
00:23:32,133 --> 00:23:33,851
You've been talking too much.

283
00:23:33,933 --> 00:23:36,527
-What do you mean "talking too much"?
-Anybody that...

284
00:23:36,613 --> 00:23:40,970
...sides in with me right now's liable to find
themselves up to their ears in trouble.

285
00:23:41,053 --> 00:23:43,931
Is that why you haven't asked for
any deputies?

286
00:23:44,013 --> 00:23:47,642
Give me a new deck of cards.
I'm not having any luck with this one.

287
00:23:48,173 --> 00:23:51,165
I was talking about why you haven't
asked for any new deputies.

288
00:23:51,253 --> 00:23:52,447
You could get some.

289
00:23:52,533 --> 00:23:54,489
How about my drivers?
You could use them.

290
00:23:54,573 --> 00:23:56,803
Suppose I got them, what would I have?

291
00:23:56,933 --> 00:23:58,730
Some well-meaning amateurs.

292
00:23:58,813 --> 00:24:01,532
Most of them worried
about their wives and kids.

293
00:24:02,253 --> 00:24:05,051
Burdette has 30 or 40 men,
all professionals.

294
00:24:05,333 --> 00:24:08,643
Only things they're worried
about is earning their pay.

295
00:24:09,413 --> 00:24:13,770
No, Pat, all I'd be doing is giving them
more targets to shoot at.

296
00:24:14,133 --> 00:24:16,089
A lot of people would get hurt.

297
00:24:16,493 --> 00:24:17,972
Joe Burdette isn't worth it.

298
00:24:18,053 --> 00:24:20,567
He isn't worth one of those
that would get killed.

299
00:24:20,653 --> 00:24:22,325
Then what are you going to do?

300
00:24:22,413 --> 00:24:25,291
All you got for help is that old man
down at the jail and this--

301
00:24:25,373 --> 00:24:27,728
Borrachon is the name,
Mr. Wheeler.

302
00:24:28,333 --> 00:24:30,893
I'll go outside so you can talk more freely.

303
00:24:35,293 --> 00:24:36,692
Wasn't good, Pat.

304
00:24:37,093 --> 00:24:38,572
Let's sit down.

305
00:24:38,733 --> 00:24:40,132
Yeah, I know.

306
00:24:40,813 --> 00:24:42,132
I shouldn't have said it.

307
00:24:42,213 --> 00:24:44,044
I meant nothing by it.

308
00:24:44,413 --> 00:24:46,973
But I'm so used to stumbling
over that fellow.

309
00:24:47,093 --> 00:24:49,812
I don't think I ever saw him
standing on his own two feet...

310
00:24:49,893 --> 00:24:51,849
...without something to hold him up.

311
00:24:51,933 --> 00:24:53,651
How long you been coming here?

312
00:24:53,733 --> 00:24:55,166
Going on two years.

313
00:24:55,253 --> 00:24:58,882
If you'd have come through three years
ago, you wouldn't have stumbled over him.

314
00:24:58,973 --> 00:25:00,406
Dude was good.

315
00:25:00,733 --> 00:25:01,882
He was my deputy.

316
00:25:01,973 --> 00:25:04,089
Best man with a gun I ever worked with.

317
00:25:04,173 --> 00:25:06,368
That's pretty hard to believe, Chance.

318
00:25:07,493 --> 00:25:10,644
A girl. Just a girl
that came through on the stage.

319
00:25:11,133 --> 00:25:13,601
She was no good,
but couldn't tell him that.

320
00:25:13,693 --> 00:25:15,888
I tried and he damn near killed me.

321
00:25:17,133 --> 00:25:18,691
Anyway, he was hooked.

322
00:25:19,013 --> 00:25:20,162
Went away with her.

323
00:25:20,253 --> 00:25:22,721
Six months later
he came back without her.

324
00:25:22,813 --> 00:25:26,044
That's when the Mexicans
started calling him borrachon.

325
00:25:26,173 --> 00:25:28,084
-That's Spanish for--
-I know.

326
00:25:28,573 --> 00:25:29,688
He told me.

327
00:25:30,493 --> 00:25:33,326
So, for two years he's been drinking...

328
00:25:33,693 --> 00:25:38,721
...all he could buy, or somebody would buy
for him until last night.

329
00:25:39,533 --> 00:25:41,524
And how long do you think that'll last?

330
00:25:41,613 --> 00:25:42,807
I don't know.

331
00:25:43,533 --> 00:25:46,445
So in the meantime,
you have to take care of him.

332
00:25:46,533 --> 00:25:49,411
He's been doing a pretty good job
of taking care of me.

333
00:25:51,213 --> 00:25:53,363
I'm supposed to be your friend, too.

334
00:25:54,053 --> 00:25:56,965
-Why don't you let me help you?
-You're not good enough.

335
00:25:57,053 --> 00:25:58,645
I don't know! I'm as good--

336
00:25:58,733 --> 00:26:01,884
If you're so good,
why did you have to hire Colorado?

337
00:26:01,973 --> 00:26:03,691
No thanks, you keep out of it.

338
00:26:03,773 --> 00:26:04,808
That's an idea.

339
00:26:04,893 --> 00:26:07,532
-What?
-Ryan. "Colorado," you call him.

340
00:26:07,853 --> 00:26:10,447
He's young, Chance, but he's good.
Real good.

341
00:26:10,973 --> 00:26:13,965
I could use him if he's good.
But that's up to him.

342
00:26:14,653 --> 00:26:16,291
We'll see what he says.

343
00:26:35,293 --> 00:26:36,692
Good evening, Sheriff.

344
00:26:36,813 --> 00:26:38,132
Any luck, kid?

345
00:26:38,533 --> 00:26:40,922
-It's a pretty fast game.
-Son, l...

346
00:26:41,213 --> 00:26:44,330
...asked you over here
because the Sheriff's a friend of mine.

347
00:26:44,413 --> 00:26:47,086
He's got trouble. He can use a good man.

348
00:26:47,733 --> 00:26:49,610
To go against the Burdettes, Sheriff?.

349
00:26:49,693 --> 00:26:50,921
That's right.

350
00:26:51,173 --> 00:26:53,323
I told him you were one of the best.

351
00:26:57,693 --> 00:27:00,127
I'll tell you what I'm a lot better at,
Mr. Wheeler.

352
00:27:00,213 --> 00:27:02,169
That's minding my own business.

353
00:27:02,733 --> 00:27:04,212
No offense, Sheriff.

354
00:27:05,053 --> 00:27:06,168
No offense.

355
00:27:12,093 --> 00:27:13,845
I never expected that.

356
00:27:14,013 --> 00:27:15,765
He showed good sense.

357
00:27:16,253 --> 00:27:18,403
-I'd like to have him.
-I don't see why you--

358
00:27:18,493 --> 00:27:20,529
Quit stewing, Pat. You tried.

359
00:27:20,733 --> 00:27:22,086
I appreciate it.

360
00:27:22,333 --> 00:27:24,642
If you don't want me,
I'll round up my men...

361
00:27:24,733 --> 00:27:28,612
...and get set for an early start
in the morning. See you before I go.

362
00:27:32,653 --> 00:27:34,006
Enough for me for a while.

363
00:27:34,093 --> 00:27:35,321
You leaving?

364
00:27:35,453 --> 00:27:38,286
-Maybe I'll have some luck now.
-Maybe.

365
00:27:38,373 --> 00:27:40,284
If you play your cards right.

366
00:27:40,413 --> 00:27:42,563
Hope you leave some of your luck with me.

367
00:27:42,653 --> 00:27:45,042
I'll come back and give it to you next time.

368
00:27:45,133 --> 00:27:46,566
We'll ante up.

369
00:27:48,853 --> 00:27:49,729
Dude?

370
00:27:49,853 --> 00:27:50,729
Yeah?

371
00:27:51,613 --> 00:27:53,729
I'll be out in a couple of minutes.

372
00:28:13,453 --> 00:28:14,806
Hi, Sheriff.

373
00:28:15,413 --> 00:28:17,927
I'm sorry about those pants.

374
00:28:18,333 --> 00:28:20,051
Carlos told me they weren't yours.

375
00:28:20,133 --> 00:28:22,931
You're in trouble, lady.
I'd like to talk to you.

376
00:28:24,293 --> 00:28:25,362
Sure.

377
00:28:30,333 --> 00:28:32,051
Sheriff, what is it?

378
00:28:32,653 --> 00:28:36,089
I was looking through the deck of cards
you people were using.

379
00:28:36,893 --> 00:28:38,485
Three cards short.

380
00:28:39,093 --> 00:28:40,924
Pretty obvious ones, aces.

381
00:28:42,933 --> 00:28:44,366
Why do you tell me?

382
00:28:44,653 --> 00:28:48,805
I know everyone in that game except you
and the fellow in the checkered vest.

383
00:28:49,013 --> 00:28:51,322
-And did you talk to him?
-He's still there.

384
00:28:51,413 --> 00:28:52,687
You were leaving.

385
00:28:52,813 --> 00:28:54,485
And I was a winner.

386
00:28:56,013 --> 00:28:58,049
Is that all you've got to go on?

387
00:28:58,773 --> 00:29:02,049
No. Here's a handbill...

388
00:29:03,453 --> 00:29:06,650
...about a gambler they're interested in
catching up with.

389
00:29:06,853 --> 00:29:08,286
You know him?

390
00:29:08,773 --> 00:29:10,604
Says he had a girl with him.

391
00:29:11,413 --> 00:29:15,531
Says the girl's about 22,
5 foot 5 inches tall...

392
00:29:16,133 --> 00:29:20,126
...good figure, brown hair,
and wears feathers.

393
00:29:22,493 --> 00:29:25,405
Now, the man isn't our...

394
00:29:25,493 --> 00:29:28,883
...friend in the checkered vest
but you could be the girl.

395
00:29:29,533 --> 00:29:31,285
Yes, I could be.

396
00:29:32,933 --> 00:29:34,889
As a matter of fact, I am.

397
00:29:37,773 --> 00:29:40,241
Make sure you're on the stage
in the morning.

398
00:29:40,333 --> 00:29:45,043
You'd better give me the money you won,
I'll see that it gets back to the right people.

399
00:29:45,893 --> 00:29:47,645
It's pretty easy, isn't it?

400
00:29:48,093 --> 00:29:52,006
Just give you the money
and get on the stage.

401
00:29:53,853 --> 00:29:55,969
But I'm not going to make it that easy.

402
00:29:56,093 --> 00:29:59,768
You've made me mad, Sheriff.
You didn't ask me if I took those cards.

403
00:29:59,893 --> 00:30:02,123
So, you're going to have to prove
I've got them.

404
00:30:02,213 --> 00:30:04,647
The only way I know you can do that
is to search me.

405
00:30:04,733 --> 00:30:06,405
-Search you?
-That's right.

406
00:30:06,533 --> 00:30:09,331
Isn't that what a sheriff usually does
to a prisoner?

407
00:30:09,413 --> 00:30:12,849
Let's see, the cards could be in my purse...

408
00:30:12,933 --> 00:30:14,525
...but they're not.

409
00:30:15,293 --> 00:30:17,932
They could be in my shoes,
my stockings, garters.

410
00:30:18,013 --> 00:30:21,130
-All right, all right.
-I don't wear anything like those red pants.

411
00:30:21,213 --> 00:30:24,171
And my sleeves are too tight,
but there's my waist.

412
00:30:24,733 --> 00:30:27,201
You've got a job to do,
where do you intend to begin?

413
00:30:27,293 --> 00:30:30,126
-That's about enough.
-You have to prove I've got those cards.

414
00:30:30,213 --> 00:30:33,205
-You keep going, and I'm apt to do it!
-I'm not so sure.

415
00:30:34,493 --> 00:30:36,211
I think you're embarrassed.

416
00:30:36,293 --> 00:30:38,409
-And if you're not--
-If he's not...

417
00:30:38,493 --> 00:30:39,528
...he ought to be.

418
00:30:39,613 --> 00:30:41,331
What're you doing here?

419
00:30:41,533 --> 00:30:43,444
I don't think she has the cards.

420
00:30:43,533 --> 00:30:45,649
If that's what you're looking for.

421
00:30:46,293 --> 00:30:47,726
How do you know?

422
00:30:47,813 --> 00:30:50,043
The fellow in the checkered vest has them.

423
00:30:50,133 --> 00:30:51,771
Why didn't you find out?

424
00:30:51,853 --> 00:30:54,492
I said I wouldn't start anything
till I told you first.

425
00:30:54,573 --> 00:30:56,928
I'm telling you.
I'm going to see if he's got them.

426
00:30:57,013 --> 00:30:58,446
Wait a minute.

427
00:30:59,453 --> 00:31:01,603
-You want to come along?
-I do.

428
00:31:01,893 --> 00:31:03,406
I'm interested, too.

429
00:31:22,453 --> 00:31:23,852
Ace high straight.

430
00:31:24,253 --> 00:31:26,323
Looks like I got the lady's luck.

431
00:31:27,453 --> 00:31:29,489
All right, keep your hands on the table.

432
00:31:29,573 --> 00:31:31,131
Right where they are.

433
00:31:32,853 --> 00:31:34,525
Put your hands back.

434
00:31:34,693 --> 00:31:36,012
Where they were.

435
00:31:49,253 --> 00:31:50,481
Holdout.

436
00:31:51,333 --> 00:31:52,971
He's all yours, Sheriff.

437
00:31:53,293 --> 00:31:54,282
Get up.

438
00:31:55,613 --> 00:31:56,648
Get up!

439
00:31:58,333 --> 00:32:00,893
We don't like tinhorns around here, mister.

440
00:32:01,213 --> 00:32:03,329
Carlos, lock him in his room.

441
00:32:03,773 --> 00:32:05,843
Let him out in time for the stage.

442
00:32:06,173 --> 00:32:09,085
You losers can help yourself
to what's on the table.

443
00:32:09,693 --> 00:32:10,808
Thanks, Colorado.

444
00:32:10,893 --> 00:32:13,612
Sheriff, aren't you forgetting something?

445
00:32:23,493 --> 00:32:27,202
I guess I was wrong about you
having those cards.

446
00:32:28,093 --> 00:32:29,606
Is that all, Sheriff?.

447
00:32:29,813 --> 00:32:32,805
I'm not going to apologize,
if that's what you mean.

448
00:32:33,093 --> 00:32:35,653
We haven't gotten past that handbill,
have we?

449
00:32:35,773 --> 00:32:36,967
That's right.

450
00:32:37,213 --> 00:32:40,091
You haven't done anything
to make me think we will.

451
00:32:40,733 --> 00:32:43,611
Idea of being searched
didn't bother you much.

452
00:32:43,893 --> 00:32:44,928
Made a joke of it.

453
00:32:45,013 --> 00:32:47,527
Instead of me being embarrassed,
you were.

454
00:32:47,693 --> 00:32:50,810
Tell me, Sheriff, what should I have done?

455
00:32:51,453 --> 00:32:52,852
I'd like to know.

456
00:32:53,213 --> 00:32:56,046
This isn't the first time
that handbill has come up.

457
00:32:56,133 --> 00:32:58,363
I'd like to know what to do about it.

458
00:32:58,733 --> 00:33:01,884
You could quit playing cards...

459
00:33:02,653 --> 00:33:04,086
...wearing feathers.

460
00:33:04,173 --> 00:33:05,526
No, Sheriff.

461
00:33:07,093 --> 00:33:08,970
No, I'm not going to do that.

462
00:33:09,973 --> 00:33:13,170
You see, that's what I'd do...

463
00:33:15,133 --> 00:33:17,931
...if I were the kind of girl
that you think I am.

464
00:33:37,053 --> 00:33:38,566
Dude, you seen Wheeler?

465
00:33:38,653 --> 00:33:40,530
Not since he went up the street.

466
00:33:40,613 --> 00:33:42,524
I think that's him coming now.

467
00:33:55,613 --> 00:33:57,092
Get him out of here.

468
00:34:02,693 --> 00:34:05,491
Watch the stable.
That's where the shot came from.

469
00:34:07,813 --> 00:34:09,531
Got him in the back.

470
00:34:10,093 --> 00:34:11,208
He's dead.

471
00:34:13,693 --> 00:34:17,447
Didn't take them long,
less than an hour after he offered to help.

472
00:34:18,853 --> 00:34:20,923
Ain't got many friends like that.

473
00:34:22,533 --> 00:34:23,932
You were smart, Colorado.

474
00:34:24,013 --> 00:34:27,050
-No one's come out of the stable.
-I want to go with you.

475
00:34:27,133 --> 00:34:29,772
Want to help get the man
that killed your boss?

476
00:34:30,013 --> 00:34:32,652
-Wouldn't you?
-I wouldn't have let him get shot.

477
00:34:32,733 --> 00:34:35,293
You had a chance to get in this
and you didn't want it.

478
00:34:35,373 --> 00:34:37,284
Stay out, we don't need you.

479
00:34:37,373 --> 00:34:40,445
If you want to do something,
get him out of the street.

480
00:34:44,413 --> 00:34:47,530
Get around to the side
where you can see front and back.

481
00:34:47,893 --> 00:34:49,087
How you going in?

482
00:34:49,173 --> 00:34:52,370
Right through the door.
If he comes out, you can have him.

483
00:34:52,773 --> 00:34:55,128
There's no sense in me
telling you to cool down.

484
00:34:55,213 --> 00:34:56,532
No, there isn't.

485
00:34:56,613 --> 00:34:57,682
I thought so.

486
00:34:57,773 --> 00:34:59,889
I'll let you know when I get there.

487
00:36:02,013 --> 00:36:03,571
Chance, you all right?

488
00:36:19,693 --> 00:36:21,251
Chance, out here.

489
00:36:22,333 --> 00:36:23,482
You all right?

490
00:36:23,573 --> 00:36:25,529
Just dirt in my eyes. Did you get him?

491
00:36:25,613 --> 00:36:27,490
He came out the door, running fast.

492
00:36:27,573 --> 00:36:29,689
-You missed him.
-I couldn't get a good shot.

493
00:36:29,773 --> 00:36:33,129
-Might've winged him.
-Don't worry. It's my fault we lost him.

494
00:36:33,213 --> 00:36:34,566
He hasn't got away yet...

495
00:36:34,653 --> 00:36:37,326
...or I wouldn't be standing here.
He went in the saloon.

496
00:36:37,413 --> 00:36:39,688
-He's still in there.
-How do you know?

497
00:36:39,853 --> 00:36:41,684
Can see both doors from here.

498
00:36:41,773 --> 00:36:43,525
And there ain't any others.

499
00:36:43,973 --> 00:36:45,645
I'm an expert on saloons.

500
00:36:46,333 --> 00:36:48,801
-Get a chance to see who he was?
-No, but we'll know.

501
00:36:48,893 --> 00:36:52,727
He'll have muddy boots.
He stepped in that puddle by the trough.

502
00:36:53,493 --> 00:36:55,688
You figure we're going in there after him?

503
00:36:55,773 --> 00:36:57,411
-Aren't we?
-We used to.

504
00:36:58,253 --> 00:37:00,767
There's eight or ten Burdette men in there.

505
00:37:01,613 --> 00:37:02,932
Maybe more.

506
00:37:04,253 --> 00:37:06,926
You take the back door, I'll go in the front.

507
00:37:07,053 --> 00:37:08,168
I'd like to try--

508
00:37:08,253 --> 00:37:09,925
You'd like to try what?

509
00:37:11,133 --> 00:37:13,044
I been going in the back door.

510
00:37:13,293 --> 00:37:15,761
They haven't been letting me in the front.

511
00:37:17,053 --> 00:37:18,805
Think you're good enough?

512
00:37:18,893 --> 00:37:20,406
I'd like to find out.

513
00:37:20,573 --> 00:37:21,847
So would l.

514
00:37:22,613 --> 00:37:25,047
I'll let you know when I get around back.

515
00:38:24,933 --> 00:38:26,605
Begin with you, Charlie.

516
00:38:27,253 --> 00:38:29,403
That shotgun you keep under the bar.

517
00:38:30,333 --> 00:38:32,051
Pick it up by the barrel.

518
00:38:32,733 --> 00:38:33,722
Easy.

519
00:38:33,813 --> 00:38:37,442
Thought you were going to ask for a drink.
It's been a long dry spell.

520
00:38:37,573 --> 00:38:38,801
Shotgun first.

521
00:38:39,573 --> 00:38:40,688
Set it down.

522
00:38:42,053 --> 00:38:43,247
Back up.

523
00:38:48,093 --> 00:38:51,005
Jim, Pedro, get over there.

524
00:38:58,133 --> 00:39:01,921
All right, the rest of you,
I'm not going to tell you twice.

525
00:39:02,693 --> 00:39:05,844
You're going to stand up
and stand real still.

526
00:39:06,773 --> 00:39:07,728
Now!

527
00:39:12,133 --> 00:39:16,843
All right, now one by one,
start with you, unbuckle your guns...

528
00:39:17,093 --> 00:39:18,845
...drop them and step back.

529
00:39:21,453 --> 00:39:22,408
Come on.

530
00:39:29,253 --> 00:39:31,847
There's no reason for you to move, Charlie.

531
00:39:35,533 --> 00:39:36,807
What's this all about?

532
00:39:36,933 --> 00:39:39,367
We're looking for a man that ran in here.

533
00:39:39,493 --> 00:39:41,006
Nobody's run in here.

534
00:39:41,093 --> 00:39:43,209
We'll remember you said that.

535
00:39:45,453 --> 00:39:47,728
Man we're looking for has muddy boots.

536
00:39:48,413 --> 00:39:50,563
Now, one by one, hold up your feet.

537
00:40:05,653 --> 00:40:07,609
Who saw a man run in here?

538
00:40:08,733 --> 00:40:09,722
I did.

539
00:40:11,013 --> 00:40:13,607
Almost forgot about you, Charlie.
Come on out.

540
00:40:15,253 --> 00:40:16,891
Clean as a whistle.

541
00:40:17,413 --> 00:40:19,529
Dude, you been seeing things again.

542
00:40:19,613 --> 00:40:21,251
You better have a drink.

543
00:40:23,373 --> 00:40:24,328
Dude.

544
00:40:25,853 --> 00:40:27,286
Maybe this'll help.

545
00:41:07,653 --> 00:41:10,121
Guess I'll take that drink now, Charlie.

546
00:41:10,573 --> 00:41:12,291
Kind of thought you would.

547
00:41:19,613 --> 00:41:21,524
You want that gun, pick it up.

548
00:41:22,933 --> 00:41:24,332
I wish you would.

549
00:41:29,373 --> 00:41:31,329
Stepped in a puddle all right.

550
00:41:32,093 --> 00:41:33,811
It's the fellow we wanted.

551
00:41:36,093 --> 00:41:37,572
I guess this is his.

552
00:41:37,653 --> 00:41:39,848
A nice, fresh $50 gold piece.

553
00:41:40,653 --> 00:41:44,328
It's just about what Burdette would figure
a man's life was worth.

554
00:41:44,853 --> 00:41:46,923
That's earning money the hard way.

555
00:41:50,333 --> 00:41:51,652
Paid killer.

556
00:41:52,853 --> 00:41:55,765
Nice, fresh $50 gold piece.

557
00:41:57,613 --> 00:42:00,002
You, mister, you got one in your pocket?

558
00:42:00,213 --> 00:42:01,566
Nobody paid me.

559
00:42:01,893 --> 00:42:03,042
Nobody!

560
00:42:03,533 --> 00:42:05,967
And nobody run in here, either, huh?

561
00:42:07,053 --> 00:42:07,929
Chance.

562
00:42:08,013 --> 00:42:09,890
I'm not going to hurt him.

563
00:42:10,093 --> 00:42:11,048
Get up!

564
00:42:12,733 --> 00:42:14,166
You're all in it.

565
00:42:15,133 --> 00:42:16,646
The whole lot of you.

566
00:42:17,733 --> 00:42:19,724
You're going to get out of town.

567
00:42:20,093 --> 00:42:21,970
Take your boy here with you.

568
00:42:23,173 --> 00:42:25,482
You can tell Burdette you got Wheeler.

569
00:42:26,253 --> 00:42:29,529
You can tell anybody else he sends,
he'd better pay them more...

570
00:42:29,613 --> 00:42:31,808
...because they're going to earn it.

571
00:42:32,973 --> 00:42:34,850
Charlie, I want you to....

572
00:42:37,653 --> 00:42:39,325
You finished yet, Dude?

573
00:42:39,813 --> 00:42:40,882
You in a hurry?

574
00:42:40,973 --> 00:42:42,201
Not especially.

575
00:42:52,773 --> 00:42:55,241
You threw the silver dollar, didn't you?

576
00:42:55,373 --> 00:42:57,443
-Yeah, Dude, l--
-You want it back?

577
00:42:58,333 --> 00:43:00,244
-Sure.
-You know how to get it?

578
00:43:02,653 --> 00:43:03,563
Yeah.

579
00:43:19,933 --> 00:43:21,651
That's all for me, Chance.

580
00:43:22,253 --> 00:43:24,642
-Charlie, come here.
-Yeah, Sheriff.

581
00:43:24,733 --> 00:43:26,052
You're going with us.

582
00:43:26,133 --> 00:43:27,964
Why pick on me? Why choose me?

583
00:43:28,053 --> 00:43:30,692
You're carrying these guns
down to the jail for us.

584
00:43:30,773 --> 00:43:33,048
All right, back up and give him room.

585
00:43:36,773 --> 00:43:39,241
I guess they'll let you
in the front door from now on.

586
00:43:45,973 --> 00:43:49,363
You mean to tell me you followed him
into Burdette's saloon?

587
00:43:49,853 --> 00:43:51,366
Why, you're crazy!

588
00:43:51,453 --> 00:43:53,683
And you are, too. What happened?

589
00:43:54,293 --> 00:43:55,692
He was hiding in the loft.

590
00:43:55,773 --> 00:43:56,808
Who got him?

591
00:43:56,893 --> 00:43:58,531
Dude did. One shot.

592
00:43:59,693 --> 00:44:01,365
I wish I could've seen that.

593
00:44:01,453 --> 00:44:03,330
I wish Wheeler could've, too.

594
00:44:03,773 --> 00:44:06,412
Wheeler didn't think
Dude and me was much good.

595
00:44:06,533 --> 00:44:09,366
Leastways it would've showed him
he was wrong about Dude.

596
00:44:09,453 --> 00:44:11,569
He was wrong about Dude, all right.

597
00:44:11,973 --> 00:44:13,929
You were good in there tonight.

598
00:44:14,493 --> 00:44:16,245
Good as you've ever been.

599
00:44:16,573 --> 00:44:19,212
But you know one reason
why you got by with it?

600
00:44:19,573 --> 00:44:23,122
They were laughing at you.
Borrachon talking big.

601
00:44:23,413 --> 00:44:26,723
You surprised them.
But next time they'll be ready for you.

602
00:44:26,813 --> 00:44:29,281
Next time they'll shoot first
and laugh afterwards.

603
00:44:29,373 --> 00:44:31,887
-Listen to him.
-Don't get too cocksure.

604
00:44:31,973 --> 00:44:33,850
What a stinker! Spit in his eye.

605
00:44:33,933 --> 00:44:36,322
Never mind him,
he's always been a stinker.

606
00:44:36,413 --> 00:44:38,927
If he were to change, that would worry me.

607
00:44:40,733 --> 00:44:43,167
You'd think I could get one
out of a whole sack.

608
00:44:43,253 --> 00:44:45,767
How'd you know
that fellow was in the loft?

609
00:44:46,133 --> 00:44:49,523
He was losing blood.
It was dripping into a drink on the bar.

610
00:44:49,693 --> 00:44:52,287
Just when I couldn't find anybody
with muddy boots.

611
00:44:52,373 --> 00:44:54,284
I could've sure used a drink then.

612
00:44:54,373 --> 00:44:57,365
If he was bleeding that means
you hit him on the run outside.

613
00:44:57,453 --> 00:45:00,570
You did, Dude? Say, that ain't bad.
That ain't bad at all.

614
00:45:00,693 --> 00:45:03,685
Ain't good either.
We had to go in after him.

615
00:45:04,613 --> 00:45:07,969
Chance, nobody please you no how?

616
00:45:08,373 --> 00:45:10,011
You got a light, Stumpy?

617
00:45:10,333 --> 00:45:13,370
Hey, in the jail! It's me, Colorado.

618
00:45:14,013 --> 00:45:15,128
Let him in.

619
00:45:17,653 --> 00:45:18,802
Come on in.

620
00:45:22,213 --> 00:45:24,647
I hear you got the man who shot Wheeler.

621
00:45:24,813 --> 00:45:26,007
Dude did.

622
00:45:27,613 --> 00:45:29,012
Thanks, Dude.

623
00:45:30,813 --> 00:45:32,644
Going to bury him in the morning.

624
00:45:32,733 --> 00:45:35,122
I've just been at the undertaker's with him.

625
00:45:35,213 --> 00:45:37,522
Here's the money and the papers
he had on him.

626
00:45:37,613 --> 00:45:39,569
I took out $60 he owed me.

627
00:45:40,413 --> 00:45:41,732
You got yours.

628
00:45:42,053 --> 00:45:43,532
How about the rest?

629
00:45:43,653 --> 00:45:45,371
Did he owe them, too?

630
00:45:45,573 --> 00:45:46,801
Probably did.

631
00:45:47,333 --> 00:45:49,210
Didn't think about that.

632
00:45:49,493 --> 00:45:52,610
I can't turn anything over to you
till I get a court order.

633
00:45:52,693 --> 00:45:55,765
-Does that mean you hold the wagons, too?
-That's right.

634
00:45:55,853 --> 00:45:57,525
Meantime, I'm broke.

635
00:45:58,373 --> 00:46:01,410
If you or any of the rest are
short eating money...

636
00:46:01,693 --> 00:46:04,890
...l'll go good for it.
I'll tell them at the hotel.

637
00:46:05,213 --> 00:46:08,444
I wish you'd do that soon,
before anything happens to you.

638
00:46:08,773 --> 00:46:10,491
No offense again, Sheriff.

639
00:46:14,653 --> 00:46:17,121
It's nice to see a smart kid for a change.

640
00:46:17,373 --> 00:46:19,967
Yeah, he ain't like the usual kid with a gun.

641
00:46:21,173 --> 00:46:23,482
Wonder if he's as good as Wheeler said?

642
00:46:24,093 --> 00:46:25,526
I'd say he is.

643
00:46:26,493 --> 00:46:29,883
I'd say he's so good,
he doesn't feel he has to prove it.

644
00:46:38,693 --> 00:46:41,491
-Don't you ever sleep?
-I was beginning to think you didn't.

645
00:46:41,573 --> 00:46:42,892
I wanted to talk to you.

646
00:46:42,973 --> 00:46:46,170
Don't tell me
you're still looking for an apology.

647
00:46:47,013 --> 00:46:49,129
No, I was thinking of making one.

648
00:46:49,293 --> 00:46:51,204
I was pretty much of a....

649
00:46:51,613 --> 00:46:54,411
I got out of line tonight
and I'm not proud of it.

650
00:46:54,533 --> 00:46:56,330
My only excuse is...

651
00:46:56,733 --> 00:46:59,611
...l didn't know
about all the trouble you were in.

652
00:47:06,613 --> 00:47:09,127
I'm going to have a drink. How about you?

653
00:47:10,093 --> 00:47:12,323
Thanks, I'd like one.

654
00:47:14,413 --> 00:47:17,132
I'm sorry about Mr. Wheeler.

655
00:47:17,493 --> 00:47:19,882
Carlos told me he was a friend of yours.

656
00:47:20,213 --> 00:47:23,569
That's why he got shot.
Or did Carlos tell you that, too?

657
00:47:23,733 --> 00:47:25,086
Yes, he told me.

658
00:47:28,253 --> 00:47:30,369
How does a man get to be a sheriff?.

659
00:47:31,013 --> 00:47:32,207
Gets lazy.

660
00:47:32,333 --> 00:47:33,686
Gets tired...

661
00:47:33,933 --> 00:47:35,685
...of selling his gun all over...

662
00:47:35,773 --> 00:47:37,684
...decides to sell it in one place.

663
00:47:37,813 --> 00:47:39,690
I'd say you made a poor sale.

664
00:47:39,933 --> 00:47:42,367
A lot of people around here
will agree with you.

665
00:47:42,453 --> 00:47:46,048
But it's still a sale
and it's too late to back out.

666
00:47:46,133 --> 00:47:50,172
Not to change the subject, but how does
a girl get herself on a handbill?

667
00:47:51,013 --> 00:47:52,571
She gets married.

668
00:47:53,333 --> 00:47:56,405
-Handbill says he was a cheat.
-He wasn't a cheat then.

669
00:47:56,853 --> 00:48:00,163
That came later after his luck turned.

670
00:48:01,293 --> 00:48:03,443
It was probably my fault he cheated.

671
00:48:03,573 --> 00:48:05,529
He liked to buy me things.

672
00:48:05,693 --> 00:48:08,332
-Then why did you leave him?
-I didn't.

673
00:48:08,973 --> 00:48:11,771
He left me rather suddenly.

674
00:48:12,933 --> 00:48:15,447
He was caught just like that man tonight...

675
00:48:16,413 --> 00:48:18,324
...only his luck had run out.

676
00:48:18,533 --> 00:48:19,886
He was shot.

677
00:48:21,053 --> 00:48:22,691
You've had a rough time.

678
00:48:24,653 --> 00:48:27,565
You're wrong, Sheriff.
I've had a good time.

679
00:48:28,173 --> 00:48:29,526
I liked gambling.

680
00:48:30,213 --> 00:48:33,171
We went everywhere,
had the best of everything.

681
00:48:34,373 --> 00:48:38,651
I didn't know that he was cheating
until they caught him.

682
00:48:40,533 --> 00:48:42,603
If I had known, it might have been rough.

683
00:48:42,693 --> 00:48:44,843
That's probably why he didn't tell me.

684
00:48:44,933 --> 00:48:46,446
When did this happen?

685
00:48:46,573 --> 00:48:48,609
About four months ago.

686
00:48:50,453 --> 00:48:53,570
Since then I've been working...

687
00:48:54,813 --> 00:48:57,122
...to get enough money for stage fare.

688
00:48:57,373 --> 00:48:58,852
You going home?

689
00:48:58,973 --> 00:49:00,406
I haven't any.

690
00:49:00,533 --> 00:49:01,761
Senor Chance!

691
00:49:01,853 --> 00:49:04,492
I didn't know you were here.
Why do you not tell me?

692
00:49:04,573 --> 00:49:07,849
You should be in bed.
Last night you slept just a little bit.

693
00:49:07,933 --> 00:49:10,731
But tonight, you will sleep well.
I will watch.

694
00:49:10,813 --> 00:49:12,963
No, Carlos, you stay out of it.

695
00:49:13,053 --> 00:49:15,283
I don't want anybody else helping me.

696
00:49:17,493 --> 00:49:19,051
This is my hotel...

697
00:49:19,293 --> 00:49:21,568
...and you are a guest under my roof.

698
00:49:21,853 --> 00:49:25,528
And I will not be told what I shall do
and what I shall not do.

699
00:49:26,933 --> 00:49:28,969
-All right, Carlos.
-What you do?

700
00:49:29,053 --> 00:49:30,281
I'll sleep in the jail.

701
00:49:30,373 --> 00:49:31,692
But you can't sleep....

702
00:49:31,773 --> 00:49:32,922
Bueno, senor.

703
00:49:33,013 --> 00:49:35,527
There's no need to watch.
I'm a light sleeper.

704
00:49:35,613 --> 00:49:38,332
I'll lock the door
and hook a chair under the knob.

705
00:49:38,493 --> 00:49:40,802
Anybody tries to get in, I'll hear them.

706
00:49:40,893 --> 00:49:42,406
-One thing.
-What?

707
00:49:42,493 --> 00:49:44,723
If I'm asleep at sunup, wake me.

708
00:49:45,453 --> 00:49:47,489
-But it's not enough.
-Will you?

709
00:49:47,613 --> 00:49:51,049
Bueno, senor. I say no more.
Have a good sleep.

710
00:49:51,133 --> 00:49:53,203
I don't want to meddle in your business.

711
00:49:53,293 --> 00:49:54,851
I'm going to turn in.

712
00:49:55,173 --> 00:49:57,448
If I don't see you in the morning, so long.

713
00:49:57,533 --> 00:49:58,568
So long.

714
00:49:58,853 --> 00:50:01,686
By the way, where are you going?

715
00:50:02,173 --> 00:50:04,733
Some place where
there aren't any handbills.

716
00:50:04,813 --> 00:50:08,692
That thing keeps popping up.
That's why I'm a little touchy about it.

717
00:50:10,333 --> 00:50:12,642
I know the sheriff that got these out.

718
00:50:13,733 --> 00:50:16,566
I'll write him a letter, get them called in.

719
00:50:17,493 --> 00:50:20,690
Then you won't have people like me
making trouble for you.

720
00:50:33,213 --> 00:50:34,328
Thanks.

721
00:51:12,958 --> 00:51:13,834
Carlos!

722
00:51:13,918 --> 00:51:14,953
Si, senor.

723
00:51:15,038 --> 00:51:17,871
It's after 7:00.
Why didn't you wake me up?

724
00:51:17,958 --> 00:51:19,152
-The girl.
-The girl?

725
00:51:19,238 --> 00:51:22,036
-That one with the feathers.
-What's she got to do with it?

726
00:51:22,118 --> 00:51:23,676
She told me not to wake you.

727
00:51:23,758 --> 00:51:25,953
She was sitting outside your room
in a chair.

728
00:51:26,038 --> 00:51:27,949
Sitting outside my room in a chair?

729
00:51:28,038 --> 00:51:29,027
All night long.

730
00:51:29,118 --> 00:51:31,268
She was still there two, three minutes ago.

731
00:51:31,358 --> 00:51:34,794
Most likely she hear you get up.
She told me not to wake you.

732
00:51:34,878 --> 00:51:36,630
You can tell her....

733
00:51:37,438 --> 00:51:38,234
The fool!

734
00:51:38,318 --> 00:51:39,592
Tell her she's a fool?

735
00:51:39,678 --> 00:51:42,476
No! I'll tell her myself.

736
00:51:42,598 --> 00:51:44,270
You tell her she's a fool?

737
00:51:44,398 --> 00:51:45,877
I didn't say I was.

738
00:51:45,958 --> 00:51:48,995
He say, "Not to wake him up. "

739
00:51:49,078 --> 00:51:51,114
She say, "To wake him up. "

740
00:51:51,198 --> 00:51:53,109
Me, I'm in the middle. Ay, Dios.

741
00:51:56,398 --> 00:51:57,194
Who is it?

742
00:51:57,278 --> 00:51:58,597
It's me. The sheriff.

743
00:51:58,678 --> 00:52:00,191
Just a minute.

744
00:52:07,038 --> 00:52:08,153
Come on in.

745
00:52:12,278 --> 00:52:13,233
Hi.

746
00:52:13,878 --> 00:52:15,630
Did you get a good night's sleep?

747
00:52:15,718 --> 00:52:16,514
Who? Me?

748
00:52:16,598 --> 00:52:19,032
Yes, you. There's nobody else in the room.

749
00:52:19,678 --> 00:52:21,589
Carlos had to go and talk.

750
00:52:22,598 --> 00:52:25,988
I couldn't sleep anyway.
I was just as well off out there in the hall.

751
00:52:26,078 --> 00:52:29,593
If anybody had come in, you'd have yelled
before they shot you. Is that it?

752
00:52:29,678 --> 00:52:30,508
Fool women.

753
00:52:30,598 --> 00:52:32,748
-Didn't you hear me say that--
-I know.

754
00:52:32,838 --> 00:52:35,875
You don't want anyone to help you.
I heard you tell Carlos.

755
00:52:35,958 --> 00:52:38,518
-Why did you do it?
-You weren't supposed to know.

756
00:52:38,598 --> 00:52:40,953
Why didn't you just go out
and not talk to Carlos?

757
00:52:41,038 --> 00:52:42,517
He didn't wake me up!

758
00:52:42,638 --> 00:52:45,027
Don't blame him, that was my fault.

759
00:52:45,278 --> 00:52:47,667
All right, nothing happened,
nobody got hurt.

760
00:52:47,758 --> 00:52:49,988
You got some sleep, I lost some.

761
00:52:50,158 --> 00:52:53,195
Now I'm tired and you're mad
and I'm getting mad. So...

762
00:52:53,278 --> 00:52:54,757
...you'd better go on.

763
00:52:54,838 --> 00:52:56,669
I'm going to get some sleep, too.

764
00:52:56,798 --> 00:52:58,675
You can't go to bed now!

765
00:52:59,158 --> 00:53:00,307
I can't?

766
00:53:00,838 --> 00:53:03,591
You just see whether or not
I can go to bed now or not.

767
00:53:03,678 --> 00:53:05,634
You've got to get on that stagecoach.

768
00:53:05,718 --> 00:53:08,391
-What'd you say?
-The stage, it leaves in an hour.

769
00:53:08,478 --> 00:53:10,708
-Why didn't you tell me?
-I just did!

770
00:53:11,318 --> 00:53:15,357
Then you better get out then,
so I can get a bath and pack my things.

771
00:53:15,478 --> 00:53:17,514
I can't do it if you stand around talking.

772
00:53:17,598 --> 00:53:19,429
You're doing most of the talking.

773
00:53:19,518 --> 00:53:22,032
That's right. And I can't do that
and bathe and pack.

774
00:53:22,118 --> 00:53:24,074
-Will you just go on and go?
-I'm going.

775
00:53:24,158 --> 00:53:25,830
Then do it, don't talk any more.

776
00:53:25,918 --> 00:53:28,671
I'm doing enough
and neither of us are saying anything.

777
00:53:28,758 --> 00:53:31,272
So, just go on and let me get on the stage.

778
00:53:32,638 --> 00:53:34,230
Oh, hell! Goodbye.

779
00:53:34,838 --> 00:53:36,430
I just wanted to....

780
00:53:37,678 --> 00:53:39,953
You could have at least let me finish.

781
00:53:40,598 --> 00:53:44,307
You try to help someone
who doesn't want any help.

782
00:53:45,438 --> 00:53:47,315
I guess I talk too much.

783
00:53:49,438 --> 00:53:50,473
You tell her?

784
00:53:50,558 --> 00:53:52,753
-Tell her what?
-That she's a fool.

785
00:53:54,518 --> 00:53:55,792
She's going on the stage?

786
00:53:55,878 --> 00:53:58,187
She's going on the stage.
You make sure she does.

787
00:53:58,278 --> 00:54:00,633
You say she was going,
why should I make sure?

788
00:54:00,718 --> 00:54:02,948
Because I say for you
to make sure she does.

789
00:54:03,038 --> 00:54:04,312
I hold you responsible.

790
00:54:04,398 --> 00:54:05,717
Responsible, me?

791
00:54:05,798 --> 00:54:06,594
Yes.

792
00:54:09,918 --> 00:54:12,990
Dude, he's up the street.
He told me to tell you he's gone.

793
00:54:13,078 --> 00:54:14,272
So I see.

794
00:54:15,038 --> 00:54:17,871
There's a lot of people in town today.

795
00:54:18,398 --> 00:54:19,751
Did you hear why?

796
00:54:19,838 --> 00:54:24,229
A man say he hear maybe Nathan Burdette
will come to see you today.

797
00:54:24,358 --> 00:54:26,314
Most likely they here to watch.

798
00:54:27,038 --> 00:54:29,916
If he does, they may see something.

799
00:54:30,558 --> 00:54:31,911
I don't like it.

800
00:54:31,998 --> 00:54:33,192
Neither do l.

801
00:54:39,198 --> 00:54:42,315
Tom, hang your gun on the fence.
You'll pick it up when you leave.

802
00:54:42,398 --> 00:54:45,071
Sure enough.

803
00:55:09,558 --> 00:55:11,150
That's far enough.

804
00:55:11,358 --> 00:55:13,314
I got orders to take your guns.

805
00:55:13,998 --> 00:55:16,068
Suppose we don't want to give them up?

806
00:55:16,158 --> 00:55:18,831
Think you're good enough
to take them against six of us?

807
00:55:18,918 --> 00:55:21,910
For a smart man, Mr. Burdette,
that's pretty stupid.

808
00:55:22,438 --> 00:55:25,794
You won't need a gun no more
because you'd be the first man I'd get.

809
00:55:25,878 --> 00:55:27,197
Come on, let's go.

810
00:55:27,278 --> 00:55:29,553
Harris, you're pretty good right there.

811
00:55:32,158 --> 00:55:33,477
Hold it, Harris!

812
00:55:33,598 --> 00:55:34,713
He cut my reins.

813
00:55:34,798 --> 00:55:38,188
I'd say he did it on purpose.
And I'm telling you to hold it.

814
00:55:42,438 --> 00:55:46,431
Now hang your guns on the fence
and you can pick them up when you leave.

815
00:55:46,518 --> 00:55:47,951
Hang up your guns.

816
00:55:55,678 --> 00:55:58,146
You're pretty good with that gun
when you're sober.

817
00:55:58,238 --> 00:55:59,751
Not bad.

818
00:56:00,038 --> 00:56:01,357
How does that happen?

819
00:56:01,438 --> 00:56:04,748
If you mean being good with a gun,
I've had a lot of practice.

820
00:56:05,278 --> 00:56:07,269
If you mean being sober...

821
00:56:07,358 --> 00:56:10,191
...l'm getting practice on account
of your brother.

822
00:56:10,278 --> 00:56:11,506
I don't follow you.

823
00:56:11,598 --> 00:56:14,066
You don't have to follow me. Matt!

824
00:56:14,998 --> 00:56:17,353
Didn't you hear the boss say
that I was sober?

825
00:56:17,438 --> 00:56:20,350
That extra gun in your vest,
lay that on the fence, too.

826
00:56:24,078 --> 00:56:27,354
-You're enjoying yourself, aren't you?
-All right, Mr. Burdette...

827
00:56:27,438 --> 00:56:30,077
...get going.
I got no more to talk to you about.

828
00:56:30,158 --> 00:56:31,955
You should enjoy it, Dude.

829
00:56:32,158 --> 00:56:35,787
Every man should have a little taste
of power before he's through.

830
00:56:55,238 --> 00:56:56,227
Stumpy!

831
00:56:56,918 --> 00:56:58,670
Burdette and his men are coming in.

832
00:56:58,758 --> 00:57:01,272
Don't put down no red carpet for them.

833
00:57:01,358 --> 00:57:03,633
And I'm staying right
where I'm supposed to.

834
00:57:03,718 --> 00:57:05,071
You do that.

835
00:57:08,158 --> 00:57:09,750
Good morning, Sheriff.

836
00:57:10,198 --> 00:57:11,517
Hello, Burdette.

837
00:57:12,198 --> 00:57:13,870
Been expecting you.

838
00:57:14,278 --> 00:57:15,916
I want to see my brother.

839
00:57:15,998 --> 00:57:17,351
You can come in.

840
00:57:18,238 --> 00:57:22,072
But that doesn't mean the rest of you.
He's not your brother.

841
00:57:22,238 --> 00:57:24,354
Go on across the street with the others.

842
00:57:24,438 --> 00:57:25,871
Do as he says.

843
00:57:27,158 --> 00:57:29,467
What are all those people doing in town?

844
00:57:29,718 --> 00:57:31,117
I didn't ask.

845
00:57:31,638 --> 00:57:34,789
Didn't ask them to come,
or ask them why they're here.

846
00:57:35,798 --> 00:57:38,870
But I think they're watching to see
what you're going to do.

847
00:57:41,198 --> 00:57:44,634
You don't like that, do you?
Too many witnesses.

848
00:57:45,438 --> 00:57:48,555
Now do you want to keep talking to me
or see your brother?

849
00:57:49,358 --> 00:57:50,837
See my brother.

850
00:57:53,198 --> 00:57:54,836
We're coming in, Stumpy.

851
00:57:55,198 --> 00:57:58,235
Come ahead.
Don't wait for me to carry you.

852
00:58:05,478 --> 00:58:07,514
All right, Stumpy, open up.

853
00:58:08,318 --> 00:58:09,751
What's the password?

854
00:58:09,838 --> 00:58:10,827
Come on.

855
00:58:10,918 --> 00:58:13,557
I'm coming. I wouldn't miss this.

856
00:58:13,638 --> 00:58:17,347
Just want him to see how we're set up.
Look who's here.

857
00:58:17,558 --> 00:58:19,913
Place's getting all cluttered up
with Burdettes.

858
00:58:19,998 --> 00:58:21,477
Come right in, Mr. Burdette.

859
00:58:21,558 --> 00:58:24,948
That fellow round the corner
with a banged-up face is your brother.

860
00:58:25,038 --> 00:58:26,187
Nathan.

861
00:58:26,918 --> 00:58:27,953
Joe.

862
00:58:29,078 --> 00:58:31,228
Looks like they gave you a going over.

863
00:58:31,318 --> 00:58:32,831
Our friend here.

864
00:58:34,198 --> 00:58:35,074
Why?

865
00:58:35,398 --> 00:58:38,595
He didn't take too kindly
to being arrested for murder.

866
00:58:38,758 --> 00:58:40,316
It wasn't murder.

867
00:58:40,598 --> 00:58:43,271
If he says it wasn't murder,
why do you say it was?

868
00:58:43,358 --> 00:58:47,271
Man gets shot that's got a gun,
there's room for reasonable doubt.

869
00:58:48,278 --> 00:58:51,429
Man gets shot that hasn't got a gun,
what would you call it?

870
00:58:52,158 --> 00:58:56,629
You knew that already, otherwise you
wouldn't have set things up like you did.

871
00:58:56,878 --> 00:58:58,277
Just what have I done?

872
00:58:58,358 --> 00:58:59,996
You're a rich man, Burdette.

873
00:59:00,078 --> 00:59:01,272
Big ranch.

874
00:59:01,398 --> 00:59:04,117
Pay a lot of people to do
what you want them to do.

875
00:59:04,638 --> 00:59:06,310
And you got a brother.

876
00:59:06,398 --> 00:59:08,787
He's no good, but he's your brother.

877
00:59:09,438 --> 00:59:12,908
If he committed 20 murders,
you'd try and see he didn't hang for them.

878
00:59:12,998 --> 00:59:14,590
I don't like that kind of talk.

879
00:59:14,678 --> 00:59:16,908
-You're accusing me--
-Let's get this straight.

880
00:59:16,998 --> 00:59:18,511
You don't like it.

881
00:59:18,598 --> 00:59:20,509
I don't like a lot of things.

882
00:59:20,638 --> 00:59:24,187
I don't like your men sitting on the road
bottling up this town.

883
00:59:24,278 --> 00:59:28,351
I don't like your men watching us,
trying to catch us with our backs turned.

884
00:59:28,438 --> 00:59:31,191
And I don't like it
when a friend of mine offers to help...

885
00:59:31,278 --> 00:59:33,348
...and 20 minutes later he's dead!

886
00:59:34,078 --> 00:59:37,115
And I don't like you, Burdette,
because you set it up.

887
00:59:39,798 --> 00:59:41,914
What're you going to do about it?

888
00:59:42,958 --> 00:59:45,074
I thought you'd get around to that.

889
00:59:45,678 --> 00:59:48,067
I'm going to sit here
with your brother in my lap...

890
00:59:48,158 --> 00:59:50,877
...until the United States Marshal
gets here.

891
00:59:50,998 --> 00:59:52,954
That'll be about six days.

892
00:59:53,278 --> 00:59:56,315
He may ask a few questions
about that busted wheel.

893
00:59:56,918 --> 01:00:00,069
But I think you're too smart
to have stopped that stage completely.

894
01:00:00,158 --> 01:00:01,750
Now I'm running out of breath.

895
01:00:01,838 --> 01:00:03,715
You talk if you want to.

896
01:00:04,358 --> 01:00:07,191
He talks awful big for a man
that's all alone...

897
01:00:07,358 --> 01:00:09,588
...except for a barfly and a cripple.

898
01:00:10,878 --> 01:00:13,597
-You can get me out of here any--
-Shut up, Joe!

899
01:00:13,998 --> 01:00:16,671
You're not as smart as your brother, Joe.

900
01:00:17,278 --> 01:00:21,112
He sees Stumpy here sitting
around the corner locked in with you.

901
01:00:21,918 --> 01:00:24,591
And if that isn't plain enough,
I'll tell you why.

902
01:00:24,678 --> 01:00:27,192
If any trouble starts around this jail...

903
01:00:27,278 --> 01:00:31,112
...before anybody can get to you,
you're going to get accidentally shot.

904
01:00:31,678 --> 01:00:33,873
I can practical guarantee that.

905
01:00:35,078 --> 01:00:37,911
I see you still have
a little grudge against us.

906
01:00:39,278 --> 01:00:42,509
460 acres might be little to you, Nathan.

907
01:00:43,078 --> 01:00:44,830
But it was a lot of country to me.

908
01:00:44,918 --> 01:00:48,752
Don't take no chances, Nathan.
He looks just crazy enough to shoot me.

909
01:00:49,118 --> 01:00:50,949
He's smarter than I thought.

910
01:00:51,998 --> 01:00:54,910
You know,
a court might just call that murder, too.

911
01:00:55,358 --> 01:00:56,916
What's the difference?

912
01:00:57,038 --> 01:00:58,949
We'd all be dead by then.

913
01:00:59,198 --> 01:01:01,473
You got anything else you want to say?

914
01:01:01,918 --> 01:01:05,115
Just one thing. Joe has friends.

915
01:01:05,918 --> 01:01:08,193
You can't hold Joe
or me responsible for them...

916
01:01:08,278 --> 01:01:11,031
...what you say they've done
or what they might do.

917
01:01:11,478 --> 01:01:12,991
I want to make that clear.

918
01:01:13,078 --> 01:01:14,830
I'll help you make it clear.

919
01:01:14,958 --> 01:01:17,518
I don't think Joe's got a friend in the world.

920
01:01:17,598 --> 01:01:21,671
And he won't have any unless somebody
buys them for him at $50 a head.

921
01:01:22,078 --> 01:01:24,387
Like the fellow that shot Wheeler.

922
01:01:25,958 --> 01:01:27,550
You made it clear.

923
01:01:27,918 --> 01:01:29,271
All right, Stumpy.

924
01:01:29,358 --> 01:01:31,189
-Nathan.
-Just sit tight, Joe.

925
01:01:31,278 --> 01:01:33,189
Send me a bottle before you leave town.

926
01:01:33,278 --> 01:01:36,748
You do that, because part of my job
is to see that it ain't poisoned.

927
01:01:36,838 --> 01:01:39,557
Sometimes takes quite a spell to find out.

928
01:01:44,198 --> 01:01:46,393
-He didn't have much to say, did he?
-No.

929
01:01:51,598 --> 01:01:54,829
What did you leave him go for?
You had plenty to hold him on.

930
01:01:54,918 --> 01:01:56,510
Anything they're going to do is...

931
01:01:56,598 --> 01:01:58,987
...planned already,
or he wouldn't have come in here.

932
01:01:59,078 --> 01:02:02,354
Throwing him with Joe would give him
an alibi for whatever happens.

933
01:02:02,438 --> 01:02:03,757
I never thought of that.

934
01:02:03,838 --> 01:02:06,068
-What do you think will happen?
-I don't know.

935
01:02:06,158 --> 01:02:07,830
You can think, can't you? Any man--

936
01:02:08,318 --> 01:02:12,072
I think I told you to get back in there
and stay with that door locked.

937
01:02:12,158 --> 01:02:14,626
Be careful how you talk to me.
You hear what Joe said.

938
01:02:14,718 --> 01:02:17,915
You're alone except for a barfly
and an old cripple.

939
01:02:18,078 --> 01:02:21,912
Calling me an old cripple.
I like hearing you say that, Joe.

940
01:02:22,438 --> 01:02:24,906
I got to fix your supper for you tonight.

941
01:02:29,918 --> 01:02:30,953
Senor Chance.

942
01:02:31,038 --> 01:02:32,471
It's me, Carlos.

943
01:02:32,558 --> 01:02:33,877
Come on in.

944
01:02:34,358 --> 01:02:35,393
What do you want?

945
01:02:35,478 --> 01:02:36,752
I want to talk to you.

946
01:02:36,838 --> 01:02:38,237
Did the girl....

947
01:02:39,158 --> 01:02:40,750
What happened to your eye?

948
01:02:40,838 --> 01:02:42,908
You told me to put the lady on the stage.

949
01:02:42,998 --> 01:02:44,795
She did that? What'd you do?

950
01:02:44,878 --> 01:02:47,312
-She did not do it.
-I thought you said she did.

951
01:02:47,398 --> 01:02:51,277
I say you tell me to put her on the stage.
Consuelo, she hit me in the eye.

952
01:02:51,358 --> 01:02:54,156
-I'm a little mixed up.
-Do not talk. I tell you.

953
01:02:54,238 --> 01:02:55,956
-Okay.
-It's better if I tell you.

954
01:02:56,038 --> 01:02:59,826
You told me to put her on the stage.
The stage she's ready, but she don't come.

955
01:02:59,918 --> 01:03:02,227
I yell at her, "Come down."
She said, "No."

956
01:03:02,318 --> 01:03:04,878
-I go and get her, she said she don't go.
-Did she go?

957
01:03:04,958 --> 01:03:07,552
I tell her you say go.
I tell her I am responsible.

958
01:03:07,638 --> 01:03:10,516
She say, no, she is responsible.
And I said that may be.

959
01:03:10,598 --> 01:03:13,954
I pick her up. And Consuelo say,
"What are you doing with that woman?"

960
01:03:14,038 --> 01:03:17,348
I say, "I take her to the stage."
The woman said she don't want to go.

961
01:03:17,438 --> 01:03:18,917
Did she go on the stage?

962
01:03:18,998 --> 01:03:22,308
Consuelo tell me put her down.
I said, "I am responsible."

963
01:03:22,398 --> 01:03:25,390
Consuelo thinks that mean something else.
So she give me this eye.

964
01:03:25,478 --> 01:03:26,547
What'd you do?

965
01:03:26,638 --> 01:03:29,357
Do? What can I do?
My arms is full of the lady.

966
01:03:29,438 --> 01:03:33,636
I can do nothing. I drop her on the floor.
She yells. And she says I tried to kill her.

967
01:03:33,718 --> 01:03:35,231
Did the girl get on the stage?

968
01:03:35,318 --> 01:03:37,912
No, she did not go!
But Jake says he couldn't wait.

969
01:03:37,998 --> 01:03:39,636
-Why?
-He says he must leave.

970
01:03:39,718 --> 01:03:42,186
I mean the girl.
Did she say why she wasn't going?

971
01:03:42,278 --> 01:03:45,190
No. She didn't say.
How can I know if she don't say?

972
01:03:45,278 --> 01:03:48,873
Please come and tell Consuelo
what responsible means.

973
01:03:48,958 --> 01:03:50,516
Stumpy, we're going out.

974
01:03:50,598 --> 01:03:53,670
Fine. I like to be left alone.
I'm getting used to it.

975
01:04:01,918 --> 01:04:03,351
The door's unlocked.

976
01:04:09,918 --> 01:04:11,351
I didn't go.

977
01:04:11,838 --> 01:04:13,271
I can see that.

978
01:04:15,198 --> 01:04:16,677
I don't know...

979
01:04:17,158 --> 01:04:20,628
...l had everything all packed,
then Carlos yelled the stage was ready...

980
01:04:20,718 --> 01:04:23,551
...and I heard somebody saying
they weren't going.

981
01:04:24,518 --> 01:04:26,236
It was me saying it.

982
01:04:26,558 --> 01:04:29,709
And you want to know why I didn't go,
don't you, Sheriff?.

983
01:04:31,598 --> 01:04:34,271
What's your name, anyway?
I don't even know that.

984
01:04:34,358 --> 01:04:36,155
Chance, John T.

985
01:04:36,438 --> 01:04:37,871
"T" for trouble.

986
01:04:38,598 --> 01:04:41,237
I always make you mad, don't l, John T.?

987
01:04:42,678 --> 01:04:45,146
Then, don't make me tell you why I stayed.

988
01:04:47,518 --> 01:04:49,270
I won't make it any harder for you.

989
01:04:49,358 --> 01:04:51,997
I won't get in your way. I'll just be here.

990
01:04:53,118 --> 01:04:54,790
You don't owe me a thing.

991
01:04:54,998 --> 01:04:57,387
And you won't owe me when it's all over.

992
01:04:58,038 --> 01:05:00,916
When that happens,
just tell me to go, and I'll go.

993
01:05:02,998 --> 01:05:05,387
No, you won't even have to tell me.

994
01:05:06,078 --> 01:05:08,273
I'll know by then, and I'll just go.

995
01:05:09,358 --> 01:05:11,155
Is that fair, John T.?

996
01:05:15,838 --> 01:05:18,796
You don't have to answer me now
if you don't want to.

997
01:05:20,278 --> 01:05:23,714
But just say something.

998
01:05:24,958 --> 01:05:28,871
If I weren't in this mess,
it might be different.

999
01:05:29,838 --> 01:05:31,157
But I am.

1000
01:05:32,478 --> 01:05:34,355
That's all I wanted to hear.

1001
01:05:54,078 --> 01:05:56,194
I'm glad we tried it a second time.

1002
01:05:57,038 --> 01:05:59,108
It's better when two people do it.

1003
01:06:01,518 --> 01:06:03,509
I've kept you long enough.

1004
01:06:03,958 --> 01:06:06,426
You'd better run along now
and do your job.
