1
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:05,036
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

2
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:07,833
Mr Romales and his friends
will be out of business.

3
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:11,919
He won't be using heroin-flavoured
bananas to finance revolutions.

4
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:15,869
Don't go back to your hotel, señor.
They'il be watching you.

5
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:21,040
- There's a plane to Miami in an hour.
- I'll be on it, but

6
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:24,118
first I have some unfinished business
to attend to.

7
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:44,559
Forgive me.

8
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:46,636
Why do you always wear that thing?

9
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:49,035
I have a slight inferiority complex.

10
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:52,076
Where was I?

11
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:46,512
Shocking!

12
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,516
Positively shocking.

13
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,996
Goldfinger

14
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:21,472
<i>H</i>e's the man

15
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:25,036
The man <i>w</i>ith the Midas touch

16
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:28,876
A spider's touch

17
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:35,156
Such a cold finger

18
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:39,598
Beckons you

19
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:42,951

<i>H</i>e loves gold

One, two, three!

00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:41,031
Who's over there?

47
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:43,913
- <i>H</i>o<i>w</i>'s this?
- It's nice... Very nice.

48
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:48,272
- Just here?
- No, a little lower.

49
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:51,676
I thought I'd find you in good hands.

50
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:55,236
Felix! How are you?

51
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:57,316
- Dink, meet Felix Leiter.
- Hello!

52
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,396
- Felix, say hello to Dink.
- Hi, Dink.

53
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:01,476
Dink, say goodbye to Felix.

54
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,556
Man talk.

55
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:09,074
You must be slipping, 007, letting
the opposition get that close to you.

56
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,350
They got a lot closer to you in Jamaica.

57
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:13,516
What's on your mind? I'm on holiday.

58
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:16,108
Not any more, you're not.
Signal from London.

59
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:19,676
I knew M wouldn't book me into
the best hotel here out of gratitude.

60
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:21,791
He asked us to keep
an eye on him for you.

61
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:24,878
Auric Goldfinger.
Sounds like a French nail varnish!

62
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,275
He's British. But he doesn't sound like it.

63
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:30,312
Big operator, worldwide interests.
All seem reputable.

64
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:32,396
Owns one of the finest US stud farms.

65
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:35,273
- What's the tie-up with Washington?
- He's clean.

66
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:36,389
And where do l find him?

67
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:46,550
That's his pigeon waiting for him now.

68
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:50,389
Goldfinger's been taking him
to the cleaners every day for a week.

69
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:56,239
Morning, Mr Simmons!
Ready for our little game?

70
00:09:56,360 --> 00:10:00,035
Sure. When you're ten grand
in the hole, you're ready for anything.

71
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:03,675
- Could I have my usual seat?
- You and your suntan!

72
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:05,836
Goldfinger's a fabulous card player.

73
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:08,315
- Same stakes?
- Let's double it.

74
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:10,396
Five dollars a point.

75
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:15,712
- Did you say five?
- My luck's gotta change some time.

76
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:18,070
OK.

77
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:21,595
I'll get back
and cable M you're on the job.

78
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:24,757
- Fill me in on the rest at dinner.
- Fine. I'll call you later.

79
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:42,719
- Four.
- So soon?

80
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:44,558
How many?

81
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:47,592
7, 12, 18, 32,

82
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:49,676
44.

83
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:00,915
Miss?

84
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:02,996
Hey, what are you...?

85
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:05,356
That's Mr Goldfinger's suite!

86
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:07,436
Yes, l know.

87
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:10,836
You're very sweet.

88
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:19,874
He just drew the king of clubs.
That makes his count 59.

89
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,468
He's got a diamond run: eight, nine, ten.

90
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:28,952
He's holding on to the six of spades,
so I guess he thinks you want it.

91
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:32,356
That last draw was the eight of hearts.

92
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:35,196
He needs kings and queens.

93
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:39,438
- Who are you?
- Bond. James Bond.

94
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:54,035
Come on, come on!

95
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:56,519
That's more like it!

96
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:59,836
- What's your name?
- Jill.

97
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:03,236
- Jill who?
- Jill Masterson.

98
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:08,352
- Tell me, Jill. Why does he do it?
- He likes to win.

99
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:12,075
- Why do you do it?
- He pays me.

100
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:15,829
- Is that all he pays you for?
- And for being seen with him.

101
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:17,791
Just seen?

102
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:20,388
Just seen.

103
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:22,476
I'm so glad.

104
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:28,750
You're much too nice to be mixed up
in anything like this, you know.

105
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:37,755
Now hear this, Goldfinger.
Your luck has just changed.

106
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:42,237
I doubt if the Miami Beach police
would take kindly to what you're doing.

107
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:45,920
Nod your head if you agree.

108
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:47,996
Nod.

109
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:51,395
Good! Now start losing, Goldfinger.

110
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:54,512
Shall we say $10,000?

111
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:56,596
No, let's be generous.

112
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:58,676
Let's make it $15,000.

113
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:02,237
May I see?

114
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:11,875
Hell, I can see this is really my day!

115
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,956
Gin!

116
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:23,960
Over and out.

117
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:26,913
That should keep him occupied
for quite some time.

118
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,996
I'm beginning to like you, Mr Bond.

119
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:31,554
Call me James.

120
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:34,752
More than anyone I've met
in a long time... James.

121
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:38,879
What on earth
are we going to do about it?

122
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,275
- Yes. What?
- I'll tell you at dinner.

123
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:43,356
Where?

124
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:45,596
Well, I know the best place in town.

125
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:08,436
Station WEDS brings you
the latest in <i>w</i>orld ne<i>w</i>s.

126
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:10,710
Washington. At the White <i>H</i>ouse today,

127
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:13,673
the President said
he <i>w</i>as entirely satisfied...

128
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:19,756
That makes two of us.

129
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:28,436
- Hello.
- Leiter here.

130
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:30,516
- Felix!
- Well, no<i>w</i>?

131
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:32,596
What's that? Dinner?

132
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:34,676
No, look, I'm sorry.

133
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:37,234
I can't. Something big's come up.

134
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:41,116
How about breakfast?

135
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:43,196
- OK.
- Not too early.

136
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:47,074
- l'll call you around nine.
- Yes, nine o'clock will be fine.

137
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:49,156
- So long, James.
- Good night, Felix.

138
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,956
It's lost its chill!

139
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:08,519
- Why, you!
- There's another in the fridge.

140
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:12,995
- Who needs it?
- My dear, some things just aren't done.

141
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:15,799
Such as drinking Dom Pérignon '53

142
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:18,639
above a temperature of 38<i>º</i> Fahrenheit.

143
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:21,115
That's as bad as listening
to the Beatles without earmuffs.

144
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:26,520
Now... where is this passion juice?

145
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:05,395
Jill?

146
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:45,791
<i>Y</i>es, Mr Bond?

147
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:49,117
Beach 79432. Room 119.

148
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:58,076
- Hello?
- Hello, Felix.

149
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:00,111
Get over here right away.

150
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:02,515
- What's happened?
- The girl's dead.

151
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:05,393
- Dink?
- No, Masterson. Jill Masterson.

152
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:09,597
And she's covered in paint. Gold paint.

153
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:20,998
Gold?

154
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:23,031
All over?

155
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:26,516
She died of skin suffocation.
It can happen to cabaret dancers.

156
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:29,837
You should leave a small bare patch
at the base of the spine

157
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:31,916
to allow the skin to breathe.

158
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:34,759
- Someone obviously didn't.
- And I know who.

159
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:41,555
This isn't a personal vendetta, 007.

160
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:43,636
It's an assignment like any other.

161
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:47,548
And if you can't treat it as such,
coldly and objectively,

162
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:49,636
008 can replace you.

163
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:53,835
You've hardly distinguished yourself.

164
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:57,475
You were to observe Mr Goldfinger.
Not borrow his girlfriend.

165
00:17:57,640 --> 00:18:01,030
Instead, Goldfinger goes to Europe
and it's only thanks to Leiter

166
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:03,151
and my diplomatic intervention

167
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:05,953
that you're not being held
by the Miami Beach police!

168
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:08,036
Sir, I am aware of my shortcomings.

169
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:12,517
But I'm prepared to continue this
assignment in the spirit you suggest

170
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:15,200
if l kne<i>w w</i>hat it <i>w</i>as about,

171
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:16,992
sir.

172
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:19,759
What do you know about gold?
Not paint, bullion.

173
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:22,436
I know it when I see it.

174
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:25,279
Meet me here at seven.

175
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:27,356
Black tie.

176
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:37,875
What do you know about gold,
Moneypenny?

177
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,639
The only gold I know about
is the kind you wear.

178
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:43,194
You know, on the third finger
of your left hand.

179
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:45,754
One of these days
we really must look into that.

180
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:48,269
What about tonight?
Come round for dinner

181
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:51,354
and I'll cook you a beautiful angel cake.

182
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:53,630
Nothing would give me greater pleasure

183
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:57,116
but unfortunately I do have
a... business appointment.

184
00:18:57,240 --> 00:19:00,152
That's the flimsiest excuse
you've ever given me!

185
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:02,635
Some girls have all the luck!

186
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:05,673
- Who is she, James?
- She is me, Miss Moneypenny,

187
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:09,839
and kindly omit the customary by-play
with 007. He's dining with me

188
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:11,951
and l don't <i>w</i>ant him to be late.

189
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:14,476
So there's hope for me yet?

190
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:18,076
Moneypenny...

191
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:20,156
Won't you ever believe me?

192
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:23,796
We here at the Bank of England

193
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:26,593
are the official depository
for gold bullion.

194
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:29,757
Just as Fort Knox, Kentucky,
is for the United States.

195
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:33,668
We know the amounts we each hold and
the amounts deposited in other banks.

196
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:36,951
We can estimate what is being held
for industrial purposes.

197
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:39,275
Thus, both governments can establish

198
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:41,630
the true value
of the dollar and the pound.

199
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:44,991
Consequently, we are concerned
with unauthorised leakages.

200
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:47,076
I take it you mean smuggling.

201
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:48,633
Yes.

202
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:53,276
Gold, gentlemen, which can be melted
down and recast, is all but untraceable,

203
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:56,551
which makes it, unlike diamonds,
ideal for smuggling,

204
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:59,797
attracting the biggest
and most ingenious criminals.

205
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:02,912
- Thank you, Brunskill. That'll be all.
- Thank you, sir.

206
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:06,191
Have a little more of this...
rather disappointing brandy.

207
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:09,835
- What's the matter with it?
- I'd say it was a 30-year-old Fine,

208
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:11,916
indifferently blended, sir.

209
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:14,758
With an overdose of Bons Bois.

210
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:17,440
Colonel Smithers is
giving the lecture, 007.

211
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:22,554
Gentlemen, Mr Goldfinger
has gold bullion on deposit

212
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:26,309
in Zurich, Amsterdam, Caracas
and Hong Kong - worth $20 million.

213
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:29,591
- Most of it came from this country.
- Why move it?

214
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:32,314
The price of gold varies
from country to country.

215
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:36,479
If you buy it here at $30 an ounce,
you can sell it in, say, Pakistan at $110

216
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:38,477
and triple your money.

217
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:41,672
- If you have facilities for melting it down.
- And has he?

218
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:45,270
Apart from being a legitimate
bullion dealer, Mr Goldfinger poses...

219
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:47,197
No, that's not quite fair.

220
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:51,677
Is, among his many other interests,
a legitimate international jeweller.

221
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:56,032
He's legally entitled to operate
modest metallurgical installations.

222
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:58,515
His British one is down in Kent.

223
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:01,757
We've failed to discover
how he transfers his gold overseas.

224
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:03,632
And Lord knows we've tried.

225
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:07,548
If your department can establish
that it is done illegally,

226
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:10,717
the bank can take action
to recover most of his holdings.

227
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:13,195
I think it's time Mr Goldfinger and l met.

228
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:15,276
Socially, of course.

229
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:17,356
I was hoping you'd say that.

230
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:21,669
It might lead to a business talk...
Mr Goldfinger's kind of business.

231
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:23,756
- I'll need some sort of bait.
- I quite agree.

232
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:27,555
This is the only one we have
from the Nazi hoard in Lake Toplitz.

233
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:29,636
But there are undoubtedly others.

234
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:33,914
Mr Bond can make
whatever use of it he thinks fit.

235
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:36,235
Providing he returns it, of course.

236
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:38,316
It's worth $5,000.

237
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,310
You'll draw it from Q branch
with your equipment in the morning.

238
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:46,953
Of course, sir.

239
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:04,551
- Morning, Q.
- Morning, 007.

240
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:06,636
This way, please.

241
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:08,751
My, we are busy this morning!

242
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:16,476
It's not perfected yet.

243
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:20,076
- Where's my Bentley?
- It's had its day, I'm afraid.

244
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:22,998
- But it's never let me down.
- M's orders, 007.

245
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:27,432
You'll be using this Aston Martin DB5
with modifications.

246
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:29,516
Now, pay attention, please.

247
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:34,513
Windscreen - bulletproof.
As are the side and the rear windows.

248
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:37,635
Revolving number plates, naturally.

249
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:39,716
Valid all countries.

250
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:44,155
Here's a nice little transmitting device,
called a homer.

251
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:47,636
You prime it by pressing that back
like this. You see?

252
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:50,399
The smaller model is now
standard field issue,

253
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:52,750
to be fitted into the heel of your shoe.

254
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:54,836
Its larger brother is magnetic.

255
00:22:55,480 --> 00:23:00,156
Right. It'll be concealed in the car
you're trailing while you keep out of sight.

256
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:03,236
Reception

257
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:05,316
on the dashboard here.

258
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:09,998
Audiovisual, range 150 miles.

259
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:12,670
Ingenious, and useful too.

260
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:15,473
Allow a man to stop off
for a quick one en route.

261
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:18,239
It has not been perfected
out of years of patient research

262
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:20,476
entirely for that purpose, 007.

263
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:26,591
And incidentally we'd appreciate its
return, along with your other equipment.

264
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:29,473
Intact, for once,
when you return from the field.

265
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:33,639
You'd be surprised at the wear and tear
that goes on out there in the field.

266
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:36,832
- Anything else?
- I won't keep you for more than an hour

267
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:39,155
if you give me
your undivided attention.

268
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:41,840
We've installed
some interesting modifications.

269
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:43,871
You see this arm here?

270
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:49,079
Now, open the top and inside are
your defence mechanism controls.

271
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:51,430
Smoke screen. Oil slick.

272
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:53,516
Rear bulletproof screen.

273
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:56,074
And leFTand right
front-wing machine guns.

274
00:23:56,200 --> 00:24:00,159
Now, this one I'm particularly keen about.
You see the gear lever here?

275
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:02,236
Now, if you take the top off,

276
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:04,556
you'll find a little red button.

277
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:08,000
- Whatever you do, don't touch it.
- And why not?

278
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:10,873
Because you'll release
this section of the roof

279
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,753
and engage and fire
the passenger ejector seat.

280
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:17,116
Ejector seat? You're joking!

281
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:19,836
I never joke about my work, 007.

282
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:27,556
- Ready, Blacking?
- Yes, sir.

283
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:30,717
An old member has dropped by, sir.
Same handicap as yours.

284
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:33,752
- I wondered if you'd rather play with him.
- Where is he?

285
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:35,996
- Mr Bond.
- Yes?

286
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:38,190
This is Mr Goldfinger.

287
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:43,949
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

288
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:48,472
- You can leave now. The first tee is clear.
- Fine.

289
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:51,956
- Hawker will caddy for you, Mr Bond.
- That'll be splendid.

290
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:55,516
Shall we make it a shilling a hole?

291
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:58,518
- I'll take some tees.
- Yes, of course.

292
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:03,711
You must excuse Oddjob, Mr Bond.

293
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:05,751
He's an admirable manservant

294
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:07,950
but mute. He's not a very good caddy.

295
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:12,073
Golf is not yet
the national game of Korea.

296
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:25,476
This meeting is not a coincidence.

297
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,956
What's your game, Mr Bond?

298
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:38,151
- My game?
- You didn't come here to play golf.

299
00:25:57,960 --> 00:26:00,793
A 1940 smelt from
the Weigenhaler foundry at Essen.

300
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:03,559
- Part of a smelt of 600.
- They vanished in 1944.

301
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:05,636
When the Nazis were on the run.

302
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:08,558
- Do you have access to more?
- Yes, from the same source.

303
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:10,033
Interesting.

304
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:13,835
- Two holes to go.
- Yes, and all square.

305
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:17,077
Then you have no objection
to increasing the stakes?

306
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:21,113
- No. What do you have in mind?
- The bar of gold you have, naturally.

307
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:26,869
- It's worth $5,000.
- Oh, I'll stake the cash equivalent!

308
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:30,876
Naturally.

309
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:36,476
Strict rules of golf?

310
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:39,556
But of course.

311
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:13,270
Bad luck, you're in the rough.

312
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:23,588
What a pity. Here it is.

313
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:27,557
No, it's not. He plays a Slazenger 1.

314
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:31,832
Strict rules of golf, Goldfinger.
Five minutes are almost up.

315
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:34,838
A lost ball will cost you
stroke and distance.

316
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:53,194
I'm still training him as a caddy.

317
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:56,352
Successfully, too.

318
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:59,957
Slazenger No.1.

319
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:02,548
Good.

320
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:05,831
If that's his original ball,
I'm Arnold Palmer.

321
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:07,678
It isn't.

322
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:10,758
- How do you know?
- I'm standing on it.

323
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:14,189
Why, you craFTy old...!

324
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:16,311
Leave it.

325
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:20,556
- The ball you found, sir?
- Yes, Slazenger 7.

326
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:23,669
Let's have a little fun with Mr Goldfinger.

327
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:29,996
Like me to mark it or knock it in?

328
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:32,076
Play it.

329
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,309
- This for a half.
- That's right.

330
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:51,556
One to go, that will be the clincher.

331
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:53,910
Fine.

332
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:56,554
Did you switch 'em, sir?

333
00:28:56,680 --> 00:29:00,309
- Then we've got him.
- If he doesn't notice the switch.

334
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:08,279
- It's your honour, sir.
- It's all right.

335
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:34,957
Down in five.

336
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:37,640
I have to sink this to halve the game,
right?

337
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:45,949
- You win, Goldfinger.
- It seems I'm too good for you!

338
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:50,838
You play a Slazenger 1, don't you?

339
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:54,316
- Yes, why?
- This is a Slazenger 7.

340
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:56,635
Here's my Penfold Hearts.

341
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:59,718
You must have played the wrong ball
on the 18th fairway.

342
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:01,796
We are playing strict rules, so

343
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:04,309
I'm afraid you lose
the hole andthe match.

344
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:42,074
She's a beauty. Phantom III, '37, isn't she?

345
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:47,240
- You are clever and resourceful, Mr Bond.
- Thank you.

346
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:51,831
Perhaps too clever. Twice our paths
have crossed. Let's leave it at that.

347
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:54,235
Didn't our first meeting convince you?

348
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:58,399
I see. You're worried about me
not giving you a return game.

349
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:03,349
Both of us know perfectly well
what we're talking about, Mr Bond.

350
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:05,630
But I see that it is necessary
to remind you.

351
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:07,716
Oddjob!

352
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:12,235
Many people have tried to involve
themselves in my affairs.

353
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:14,316
Unsuccessfully.

354
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:30,677
Remarkable. But what does
the club secretary have to say?

355
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:32,756
Nothing, Mr Bond.

356
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:34,836
I own the club.

357
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:38,999
I assume you want the cheque
made out to cash.

358
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:41,350
That would be perfectly satisfactory.

359
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:48,156
Goodbye, Mr Bond.

360
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:52,240
I believe this is yours.

361
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:28,115
Can l have your attention, please?

362
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:31,630
British United Air <i>F</i>erries
announce the final call

363
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:36,715
for the departure
of their V<i>F</i>400 flight to Geneva.

364
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:47,276
British United Air <i>F</i>erries announce the
departure of their V<i>F</i>400 flight to Geneva.

365
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:48,913
Mr Bond!

366
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:52,715
I've got you booked on the next flight
to Geneva, leaving in half an hour.

367
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:54,796
- Thank you very much.
- Right, sir.

368
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:12,476
Discipline, 007.

369
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,116
Discipline.

370
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:26,471
Are you all right? Here, let me help you.

371
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:29,398
- You know, you're lucky to be alive.
- No thanks to you.

372
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:31,476
You should've pulled over further.

373
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:33,833
Look at them!

374
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:37,191
A double blowout.
I've never seen one of these before.

375
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:40,915
- How could new tyres...?
- A defect of some kind, most likely.

376
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:42,996
I'm so glad it's the car and not you.

377
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:45,634
You don't look like a girl
who should be ditched.

378
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:47,990
Never mind that.
Please take me to a garage.

379
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:50,076
Certainly.

380
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:52,196
By the way, my name is Bond, Ja...

381
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:54,276
As quickly as possible.

382
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:04,316
- I'll take that.
- Yes, of course.

383
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:12,676
What's your name, by the way?

384
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:14,756
Soames. Tilly Soames.

385
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:19,192
Here for the hunting season?

386
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:22,073
I had a case just like that one.

387
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:26,430
It's for my ice skates.

388
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:29,076
Lovely sport.

389
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:33,592
- Where do you skate?
- St Moritz.

390
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:36,792
I didn't know there was ice there
this time of the year.

391
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:39,150
There's a garage.

392
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:51,233
<i>F</i>rulein!

393
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:54,236
I've had an accident.

394
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:06,754
How long will it take?

395
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:08,518
Thank you.

396
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:14,789
They say it'll take 24 hours to get
new tyres. There's a hotel nearby.

397
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:18,276
- Jump in. l'll run you down.
- That won't be necessary.

398
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:20,356
I hate to leave you here alone.

399
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:22,436
I can take care of myself.

400
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:24,516
Yes, l'm sure you can.

401
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:26,710
Well... don't forget to write.

402
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:21,958
Smuggling is an art, Mr Ling.

403
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:24,196
And art requires...

404
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:28,836
In this case, the bodywork
of my Rolls Royce is 18-carat gold.

405
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,877
We dismantle it here.

406
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:37,710
Reduce the gold in this special furnace,
which in turn...

407
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:39,796
..weighing approximately two tons.

408
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:45,397
I make six trips a year to Europe
in the Rolls Royce, Mr Ling.

409
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:48,080
It would be wiser to suspend
your other activities.

410
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:50,714
Mr Ling, please assure your principals

411
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:54,549
Operation Grand Slam
will have my undivided attention...

412
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:54,433
Let me go! You're breaking my back!

413
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:57,518
- What the hell are you doing here?
- I want to kill him!

414
00:41:57,640 --> 00:41:59,596
- Kill who?
- Goldfinger.

415
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:03,156
- Well, I want him alive.
- I want him dead! He killed my sister!

416
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:05,236
TM. Tilly Masterson.

417
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:07,954
I knew your sister Jill.
I know what he did to her.

418
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:10,036
No, you don't! Let me go!

419
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:13,357
- So why did you shoot at me?
- I didn't. I was shooting at him!

420
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:15,710
Well, you're a lousy shot.

421
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:17,796
But somebody else around here isn't.

422
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:18,875
Come on.

423
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:29,156
Get in the car. l'll take care of him.

424
00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:25,555
Run for that bracken when I tell you.

425
00:44:34,840 --> 00:44:35,875
Now!

426
00:48:31,360 --> 00:48:33,157
Good evening, 007.

427
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:35,236
My name is James Bond.

428
00:48:36,680 --> 00:48:40,195
And members of your curious profession
are few in number.

429
00:48:42,080 --> 00:48:44,036
You have been recognised.

430
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:48,199
Let's say by one of your opposite
numbers, who is also licensed to kill.

431
00:48:48,320 --> 00:48:50,436
That interesting car of yours!

432
00:48:52,640 --> 00:48:54,596
I, too, have a new toy, but

433
00:48:54,720 --> 00:48:56,631
considerably more practical.

434
00:48:56,760 --> 00:48:59,354
You are looking at an industrial laser,

435
00:48:59,480 --> 00:49:02,438
which emits an extraordinary light,
unknown in nature.

436
00:49:02,560 --> 00:49:04,869
It can project a spot on the moon.

437
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:09,754
Or at closer range, cut through
solid metal. I will show you.

438
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:38,596
This is gold, Mr Bond.

439
00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:42,318
All my life,
I've been in love with its colour,

440
00:49:42,440 --> 00:49:44,954
its brilliance, its divine heaviness.

441
00:49:46,640 --> 00:49:50,189
I welcome any enterprise
that will increase my stock,

442
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:53,077
which is considerable.

443
00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:58,794
I think you've made your point.
Thank you for the demonstration.

444
00:49:58,920 --> 00:50:02,754
Choose your next witticism carefully,
Mr Bond. It may be your last.

445
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:08,557
The purpose of our two encounters
is now very clear to me.

446
00:50:08,680 --> 00:50:12,229
I do not intend to be distracted
by another. Good night, Mr Bond.

447
00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:16,473
Do you expect me to talk?

448
00:50:17,600 --> 00:50:19,591
No, Mr Bond! l expect you to die!

449
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:24,555
There is nothing you can talk to me about
that I don't already know.

450
00:50:35,600 --> 00:50:37,556
You're forgetting one thing.

451
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:40,996
If I fail to report, 008 replaces me.

452
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,116
I trust he will be more successful.

453
00:50:48,160 --> 00:50:49,957
He knows what I know.

454
00:50:50,080 --> 00:50:52,196
You know nothing, Mr Bond.

455
00:50:53,600 --> 00:50:56,592
Operation Grand Slam, for instance.

456
00:51:19,520 --> 00:51:21,750
Two words you may have overheard

457
00:51:21,880 --> 00:51:26,556
which cannot have any significance
to you or anyone in your organisation.

458
00:51:26,680 --> 00:51:28,750
Can you afford to take that chance?

459
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:46,080
You are quite right, Mr Bond.

460
00:51:46,200 --> 00:51:48,156
You are worth more to me alive.

461
00:52:19,840 --> 00:52:21,796
Who are you?

462
00:52:21,920 --> 00:52:24,514
My name is Pussy Galore.

463
00:52:27,160 --> 00:52:29,116
I must be dreaming.

464
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:40,956
I thought I'd wake up dead.

465
00:52:41,520 --> 00:52:43,476
Tranquilliser gun. Knockout shot.

466
00:52:43,600 --> 00:52:45,556
I see.

467
00:52:47,800 --> 00:52:51,110
I'm delighted to be here.

468
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:55,553
And, by the way, where is here?

469
00:52:55,680 --> 00:52:59,036
35,000 feet flying southwest
over Newfoundland.

470
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:01,956
That explains the humming.

471
00:53:02,080 --> 00:53:06,870
That means you're in Mr Goldfinger's
Lockheed JetStar, heading for Baltimore.

472
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:09,275
- And you're his guest.
- I'm honoured.

473
00:53:09,400 --> 00:53:12,631
I never realised he enjoyed
my company that much.

474
00:53:12,760 --> 00:53:15,228
I don't suppose it'll be all fun and games.

475
00:53:15,360 --> 00:53:17,316
Mei-Lei.

476
00:53:18,240 --> 00:53:20,549
Can I do something for you, Mr Bond?

477
00:53:20,680 --> 00:53:25,037
Just a drink.
A martini, shaken not stirred.

478
00:53:28,040 --> 00:53:29,996
- Won't you join me?
- Not on duty.

479
00:53:30,120 --> 00:53:32,111
I'm Mr Goldfinger's personal pilot.

480
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:34,916
You are?

481
00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:36,996
And just how personal is that?

482
00:53:38,440 --> 00:53:40,396
I'm a damn good pilot.

483
00:53:40,520 --> 00:53:41,555
Period!

484
00:53:41,680 --> 00:53:44,035
Well, that's good news. By the way,

485
00:53:44,160 --> 00:53:46,230
- where is our host?
- He flew on ahead.

486
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:51,956
Thank you.

487
00:53:56,880 --> 00:53:59,792
Here's to Operation Grand Slam.

488
00:54:03,720 --> 00:54:05,870
This should be a memorable flight.

489
00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:10,715
You can turn off the charm.
I'm immune.

490
00:54:25,680 --> 00:54:27,398
We'll be landing in Baltimore,

491
00:54:27,520 --> 00:54:31,195
our port of entry into the United States,
in 55 minutes.

492
00:54:32,160 --> 00:54:33,832
Mei-Lei.

493
00:54:33,960 --> 00:54:37,111
I would like to arrive
more appropriately dressed.

494
00:54:37,240 --> 00:54:39,913
Did any of my luggage survive with me?

495
00:54:41,960 --> 00:54:43,916
And my attaché case?

496
00:54:44,040 --> 00:54:47,919
Black attaché case damaged
when examined. So sorry.

497
00:54:48,040 --> 00:54:50,156
Apologies quite unnecessary.

498
00:54:57,240 --> 00:54:59,629
Sydney, tell Mei-Lei
to keep an eye on him.

499
00:56:33,160 --> 00:56:35,355
We'll be landing in 20 minutes.

500
00:56:35,480 --> 00:56:37,914
Do you want to play it easy...
or the hard way?

501
00:56:38,040 --> 00:56:39,996
And this isn't a tranquilliser.

502
00:56:40,120 --> 00:56:43,237
Pussy, you know a lot more
about planes than guns.

503
00:56:43,360 --> 00:56:45,555
That's a Smith & Wesson .45.

504
00:56:45,680 --> 00:56:49,434
If you fire this close, the bullet
will pass through me and the fuselage

505
00:56:49,560 --> 00:56:51,516
like a blowtorch through butter.

506
00:56:51,640 --> 00:56:55,599
The cabin will depressurise and we'll
be sucked into outer space together.

507
00:56:55,720 --> 00:56:58,154
If that's how you want to arrive,
you're welcome.

508
00:56:58,280 --> 00:57:00,236
As for me, I prefer the easier way.

509
00:57:00,360 --> 00:57:02,191
That's very sensible.

510
00:57:02,320 --> 00:57:05,232
And there's so much going on
around Mr Goldfinger,

511
00:57:05,360 --> 00:57:08,352
I wouldn't dream of
not accepting his... hospitality.

512
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:10,956
He'll be very glad to see you, too.

513
00:57:11,080 --> 00:57:13,435
You like close shaves, don't you?

514
00:57:18,800 --> 00:57:21,360
Washington, sir. On the green scrambler.

515
00:57:23,040 --> 00:57:25,110
- M here.
- Leiter, sir.

516
00:57:25,240 --> 00:57:27,879
It's about 007, sir.
We picked up his homer signal

517
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:31,436
from Friendship Airport, Baltimore,
where he's just landed.

518
00:57:31,560 --> 00:57:33,676
Baltimore? Nice of him to let us know.

519
00:57:33,800 --> 00:57:35,756
Last we heard, he was in Switzerland.

520
00:57:35,880 --> 00:57:37,836
He came in on a private jet, ex Geneva.

521
00:57:37,960 --> 00:57:40,520
Registered to our old friend
Auric Goldfinger.

522
00:57:40,640 --> 00:57:44,110
I'm glad he's making progress.
Keep an eye on him for us.

523
00:57:44,240 --> 00:57:47,277
Bluegrass Field, Kentucky,
is their final destination.

524
00:57:47,400 --> 00:57:49,960
Don't charge in on him
and spoil anything, will you?

525
00:57:50,080 --> 00:57:52,150
He's evidently well on top at the moment.

526
00:58:12,760 --> 00:58:14,637
- Mr Bond.
- Of course.

527
00:58:14,760 --> 00:58:16,716
Please.

528
00:58:16,920 --> 00:58:18,876
Any time.

529
00:58:20,080 --> 00:58:22,036
Thank you.

530
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:34,956
Do mind your step, Captain.

531
00:58:35,080 --> 00:58:37,036
Just keep playing it easy.

532
00:58:39,960 --> 00:58:43,316
Mei-Lei, will you see everything's
all right with Mr Goldfinger?

533
00:58:43,440 --> 00:58:45,590
And I'll see you surprisingly soon.

534
00:59:03,560 --> 00:59:06,632
- Talented chaps.
- They should be. I trained them.

535
00:59:07,560 --> 00:59:09,357
Come on.

536
00:59:09,480 --> 00:59:11,436
You're a woman of many parts, Pussy.

537
00:59:11,560 --> 00:59:15,439
I believe the bourbon and branch water
is rather splendid here in Kentucky.

538
00:59:15,560 --> 00:59:18,711
Well, now that we're both off duty,
perhaps...

539
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:26,197
Manners, Oddjob.

540
00:59:26,320 --> 00:59:29,198
I thought you always
took your hat off to a lady.

541
00:59:30,920 --> 00:59:34,435
- You know, he kills little girls like you.
- Little boys, too.

542
01:00:17,800 --> 01:00:19,153
Well?

543
01:00:19,280 --> 01:00:21,669
- Dress rehearsal went like a dream.
- Good.

544
01:00:21,800 --> 01:00:24,837
Your final briefing is tonight.
That'll be all for now.

545
01:00:53,960 --> 01:00:56,758
Welcome to Auric Stud, Mr Bond.

546
01:00:56,880 --> 01:00:58,836
Lovely animal, isn't she?

547
01:00:58,960 --> 01:01:01,349
Certainly better bred than the owner.

548
01:01:01,480 --> 01:01:03,835
Show Mr Bond to his quarters, please.

549
01:02:03,920 --> 01:02:05,273
Felix!

550
01:02:07,880 --> 01:02:11,475
- Maybe we should just drop in on him.
- He'll shout if he needs us.

551
01:02:17,640 --> 01:02:20,154
They're all here, Mr Goldfinger.

552
01:02:20,280 --> 01:02:22,077
Oh, yes! Thank you, Kisch.

553
01:02:31,920 --> 01:02:34,593
That guy Solo's gonna wear a hole
in his shoes.

554
01:02:41,120 --> 01:02:43,270
Yeah, I like this!

555
01:02:45,120 --> 01:02:46,075
Gentlemen!

556
01:02:46,200 --> 01:02:49,636
Goldfinger, why weren't we told New York
and the West Coast were in on this?

557
01:02:49,760 --> 01:02:50,909
Look who's talking!

558
01:02:51,040 --> 01:02:53,270
I do not do business with Chicago.

559
01:02:53,400 --> 01:02:56,119
I thought we had
a private business deal to settle.

560
01:02:56,240 --> 01:02:58,754
Now I find I'm attending
a hoods' convention.

561
01:02:58,880 --> 01:03:01,997
Goldfinger, I made a delivery.
Where is my money?

562
01:03:02,120 --> 01:03:05,829
- I made a delivery, too.
- You all made the deliveries we agreed.

563
01:03:05,960 --> 01:03:08,190
And you owe me one million bucks.

564
01:03:08,320 --> 01:03:10,993
I owe each of you a million

565
01:03:11,120 --> 01:03:13,076
in gold bullion.

566
01:03:13,200 --> 01:03:15,156
So, pay!

567
01:03:15,800 --> 01:03:18,758
Gentlemen,
you can have the million today.

568
01:03:21,200 --> 01:03:23,156
Or ten millions tomorrow.

569
01:03:23,280 --> 01:03:25,350
Did you say ten million?

570
01:03:25,480 --> 01:03:27,994
As soon as my bank opens
in the morning.

571
01:03:28,120 --> 01:03:30,031
Banks don't open on Sunday.

572
01:03:30,160 --> 01:03:33,118
My bank will.

573
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:41,116
What's with that trick pool table?

574
01:03:50,600 --> 01:03:53,876
- Cover him!
- Hey, cover those doors.

575
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:55,956
Turn those lights back on!

576
01:03:57,160 --> 01:03:59,276
What are you trying to pull, Goldfinger?

577
01:03:59,400 --> 01:04:01,709
There is no cause for alarm, gentlemen.

578
01:04:05,360 --> 01:04:09,512
I don't like being cooped up
Iike this. What's that map doing there?

579
01:04:19,840 --> 01:04:21,796
This is my bank.

580
01:04:21,920 --> 01:04:25,276
The gold depository at Fort Knox,
gentlemen.

581
01:04:25,400 --> 01:04:28,756
In its vaults are $15 billion.

582
01:04:30,160 --> 01:04:32,276
The entire gold supply

583
01:04:32,400 --> 01:04:34,311
of the United States.

584
01:04:34,440 --> 01:04:36,158
Knock off Fort Knox!

585
01:04:38,480 --> 01:04:41,756
- Got a key or somethin'?
- Of a kind.

586
01:04:41,880 --> 01:04:45,270
There are 35,000 troops
stationed around there!

587
01:04:45,400 --> 01:04:47,356
41,000.

588
01:04:47,480 --> 01:04:49,835
And who's gonna say boo to them,
Goldfinger?

589
01:04:49,960 --> 01:04:52,713
- What's going on here?
- What is this?

590
01:04:52,840 --> 01:04:56,037
- The floor!
- What is this? A merry-go-round?

591
01:05:15,480 --> 01:05:17,710
Man has climbed Mount Everest,

592
01:05:18,880 --> 01:05:21,075
gone to the bottom of the ocean.

593
01:05:21,200 --> 01:05:23,156
He has fired rockets to the moon.

594
01:05:23,280 --> 01:05:25,236
Split the atom.

595
01:05:25,360 --> 01:05:27,191
Achieved miracles

596
01:05:27,320 --> 01:05:29,595
in every field of human endeavour...
except crime!

597
01:07:31,040 --> 01:07:33,998
The underworld
will applaud for centuries!

598
01:07:34,120 --> 01:07:36,190
- Cut the commercial!
- Get to the point!

599
01:07:36,320 --> 01:07:38,834
It's pointless.
The depository's impregnable.

600
01:07:38,960 --> 01:07:43,511
- The joint is bombproof, electrified...
- Bear with me, please!

601
01:07:43,640 --> 01:07:46,234
Fort Knox is a bank. Like any other.

602
01:07:46,360 --> 01:07:50,194
Larger, better protected perhaps,
but nonetheless a bank!

603
01:07:50,320 --> 01:07:52,788
It can be... I think the expression is

604
01:07:52,920 --> 01:07:54,433
blown.

605
01:07:54,560 --> 01:07:57,279
My plan is foolproof, gentlemen!

606
01:07:57,400 --> 01:08:00,517
I call it Operation Grand Slam.

607
01:08:00,640 --> 01:08:03,279
I have devoted 15 years of my life to it.

608
01:08:04,040 --> 01:08:06,918
Every detail has been
scrupulously prepared.

609
01:08:07,320 --> 01:08:09,629
Every eventuality has been considered.

610
01:08:09,760 --> 01:08:12,069
We'll operate on a split-second schedule.

611
01:08:12,200 --> 01:08:14,156
Your organisation, Mr Midnight,

612
01:08:14,280 --> 01:08:17,829
brought a batch of these canisters
across the Canadian border.

613
01:08:17,960 --> 01:08:20,315
They contain Delta 9.

614
01:08:20,440 --> 01:08:23,591
- Delta 9? What's that?
- An invisible nerve gas

615
01:08:23,720 --> 01:08:29,909
which disperses 15 minutes aFTer
inducing complete... unconsciousness

616
01:08:30,040 --> 01:08:31,996
for 24 hours.

617
01:08:33,560 --> 01:08:35,516
Tomorrow at dawn,

618
01:08:35,640 --> 01:08:39,155
the flying circus of my personal pilot,
Miss Pussy Galore,

619
01:08:39,880 --> 01:08:42,474
will spray it into the atmosphere.

620
01:08:44,720 --> 01:08:48,508
Once the population, including
the military, has been immobilised

621
01:08:48,640 --> 01:08:51,313
my task force,
which Mr Strap and his people

622
01:08:51,440 --> 01:08:54,318
smuggled across
the Rio Grande from Mexico,

623
01:08:54,440 --> 01:08:58,319
will approach Fort Knox
in motorised equipment

624
01:08:58,440 --> 01:09:02,194
along Bullion Boulevard,
which runs past the depository here

625
01:09:02,320 --> 01:09:04,436
and intersects with Gold Vault Road.

626
01:09:04,560 --> 01:09:09,031
This fence surrounding the depository,

627
01:09:09,160 --> 01:09:12,550
as Mr Strap reminded us, is electrified.

628
01:09:12,680 --> 01:09:14,636
It will be dynamited!

629
01:09:14,760 --> 01:09:17,991
My task force will then move
to the main entrance and demolish it.

630
01:09:18,120 --> 01:09:20,076
How, may I ask?

631
01:09:20,200 --> 01:09:24,591
You made that possible, Mr Solo. By
using your influence in shipping circles

632
01:09:24,720 --> 01:09:27,029
to bring through customs uninspected

633
01:09:27,160 --> 01:09:30,072
a consignment labelled machine parts.

634
01:09:30,200 --> 01:09:34,830
All that will then remain is to descend
to the vaults where the bullion is stored.

635
01:09:34,960 --> 01:09:36,916
- I've heard enough.
- Let him finish.

636
01:09:37,040 --> 01:09:40,237
If you have no objection...
I'll take my money now.

637
01:09:40,360 --> 01:09:43,830
What's the matter, Solo?
Too big for you to handle?

638
01:09:50,480 --> 01:09:53,438
We must respect Mr Solo's decision.

639
01:09:53,560 --> 01:09:57,553
Excuse me for a moment while l take care
of him. Make yourselves comfortable.

640
01:10:13,040 --> 01:10:16,430
- How do we get it out?
- That's the bit I wanna hear!

641
01:10:17,360 --> 01:10:19,316
Yeah, it'd better be good!

642
01:10:29,800 --> 01:10:31,756
Pussy!

643
01:10:31,880 --> 01:10:33,916
Who taught you judo?

644
01:10:34,040 --> 01:10:36,156
The gun you took.

645
01:10:39,120 --> 01:10:41,076
The gun.

646
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:43,956
The gun, of course.

647
01:10:53,120 --> 01:10:55,554
We must have a few
fast falls together some time.

648
01:11:11,880 --> 01:11:14,269
Hey, Strap!
He's got the right answers.

649
01:11:14,400 --> 01:11:18,029
You and me don't even have to be there.
The boys can handle everything.

650
01:11:25,160 --> 01:11:27,276
Hey, they closed up the fireplace!

651
01:11:28,120 --> 01:11:31,192
- I don't like this!
- What's going on here?

652
01:11:36,160 --> 01:11:38,116
The gas!

653
01:12:00,560 --> 01:12:04,792
Such a pity you did not choose to remain
with the others, Mr Solo. However...

654
01:12:09,560 --> 01:12:12,711
Mr Bond, I thought
you were resting in your quarters.

655
01:12:12,840 --> 01:12:16,469
They are delightful.
But it's much too nice to stay indoors.

656
01:12:16,640 --> 01:12:20,110
I ran into Miss Galore
and she suggested that we join you.

657
01:12:20,240 --> 01:12:23,437
Mr Solo, Mr Bond.
Another of my distinguished guests.

658
01:12:23,560 --> 01:12:25,516
- Hello.
- Leaving us so soon, Mr Solo?

659
01:12:25,640 --> 01:12:30,111
- He has a pressing engagement.
- Yeah. l'd like to get started, Goldfinger.

660
01:12:30,280 --> 01:12:32,669
- Boy!
- When you gotta go, you gotta go.

661
01:12:32,800 --> 01:12:35,268
My plane will get you
to New York on time

662
01:12:35,400 --> 01:12:37,755
with your excess luggage.

663
01:12:38,720 --> 01:12:40,676
Allow me.

664
01:12:41,480 --> 01:12:45,712
My chauffeur's an excellent driver.
You will be at the airport in a few minutes.

665
01:12:45,840 --> 01:12:48,274
Goodbye, Mr Solo.
Some other time, perhaps?

666
01:12:48,400 --> 01:12:50,356
Happy landings, old boy.

667
01:12:56,160 --> 01:12:58,230
I found him under the model.

668
01:12:59,960 --> 01:13:03,509
Operation Grand Slam.
I did enjoy your briefing.

669
01:13:07,440 --> 01:13:09,396
So did I.

670
01:13:26,200 --> 01:13:28,031
He's on the move.

671
01:13:50,880 --> 01:13:53,553
Slow down, don't crowd him.

672
01:14:09,160 --> 01:14:11,958
Are you blind or something?
You missed the turn!

673
01:14:41,240 --> 01:14:44,198
They've turned to the right
just ahead here somewhere.

674
01:14:58,280 --> 01:15:01,317
Where's this old pal of yours headed?

675
01:15:01,440 --> 01:15:03,715
Ten'll get you one, it's a drink or a dame.

676
01:17:07,400 --> 01:17:08,753
Dead.

677
01:17:08,880 --> 01:17:11,872
- Mechanical failure, maybe?
- Unless he switched it off.

678
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:13,956
Why would he do that?

679
01:17:16,160 --> 01:17:19,072
- Drive to the farm, it's all we can do.
- Right.

680
01:17:34,040 --> 01:17:38,238
Your share of Operation Grand Slam will
make you a very rich woman, my dear.

681
01:17:39,200 --> 01:17:41,589
Why else would I be in it, Mr Goldfinger?

682
01:17:42,960 --> 01:17:45,076
You'll retire to England, I suppose?

683
01:17:45,200 --> 01:17:48,078
No, I've spotted a little island
in the Bahamas.

684
01:17:48,200 --> 01:17:51,431
I'll hang up a sign, ''no trespassing'',

685
01:17:51,560 --> 01:17:53,516
and go back to nature.

686
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:58,878
- Yes, Kisch?
- Two men in a car with binoculars.

687
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:02,150
Touts looking for racing tips.

688
01:18:06,200 --> 01:18:08,430
There's another possibility, however.

689
01:18:08,560 --> 01:18:10,516
Kisch, ask Mr Bond to join us.

690
01:18:10,640 --> 01:18:13,598
We were right to spare Mr Bond's life
in Switzerland,

691
01:18:13,720 --> 01:18:15,756
if those gentlemen are his friends.

692
01:18:15,880 --> 01:18:18,599
Let's convince them
he needs no assistance.

693
01:18:19,800 --> 01:18:23,634
For their benefit, Pussy,
Iet's make him as happy as possible.

694
01:18:24,480 --> 01:18:27,597
I suggest you change
into something more suitable.

695
01:18:27,720 --> 01:18:29,995
Certainly.

696
01:18:30,120 --> 01:18:32,680
Business before pleasure.

697
01:18:49,800 --> 01:18:51,756
He wants you.

698
01:19:00,920 --> 01:19:03,559
Mr Bond. Sit down, please.

699
01:19:03,680 --> 01:19:05,636
Mint julep?

700
01:19:05,760 --> 01:19:08,354
- Traditional, but satisfying.
- Yes, thanks.

701
01:19:08,480 --> 01:19:10,755
Sour mash, but not too sweet, please.

702
01:19:12,720 --> 01:19:14,676
You disappoint me, Goldfinger.

703
01:19:14,800 --> 01:19:17,519
You know Operation Grand Slam
simply won't work.

704
01:19:17,640 --> 01:19:20,632
And incidentally
Delta 9 nerve gas is fatal.

705
01:19:21,720 --> 01:19:24,280
You are unusually well informed,
Mr Bond.

706
01:19:24,400 --> 01:19:26,755
You'll kill 60,000 people uselessly.

707
01:19:26,880 --> 01:19:30,156
Ha! American motorists
kill that many every two years.

708
01:19:30,280 --> 01:19:33,590
Yes, well... I've worked out
a few statistics of my own.

709
01:19:33,720 --> 01:19:35,676
$15 billion

710
01:19:35,800 --> 01:19:39,270
in gold bullion weighs 10,500 tons.

711
01:19:39,400 --> 01:19:44,349
60 men would take 12 days
to load it onto 200 trucks.

712
01:19:44,480 --> 01:19:46,436
At the most, you'll have two hours

713
01:19:46,560 --> 01:19:50,678
before the army, navy, air force, marines
move in and make you put it back.

714
01:19:51,640 --> 01:19:53,949
Who mentioned anything
about removing it?

715
01:19:57,720 --> 01:19:59,995
Is the julep tart enough for you?

716
01:20:00,120 --> 01:20:03,954
You plan to break into
the world's largest bank

717
01:20:04,080 --> 01:20:06,275
but not to steal anything.

718
01:20:06,400 --> 01:20:08,152
Why?

719
01:20:08,280 --> 01:20:09,793
Go on, Mr Bond.

720
01:20:09,920 --> 01:20:12,798
Mr Ling, the Red Chinese agent
at the factory?

721
01:20:12,920 --> 01:20:15,957
He's a specialist in nuclear fission...

722
01:20:17,880 --> 01:20:21,839
But of course!
His government's given you a bomb.

723
01:20:21,960 --> 01:20:24,315
I prefer to call it an atomic device.

724
01:20:24,440 --> 01:20:26,749
lt's small but particularly dirty.

725
01:20:26,880 --> 01:20:29,633
- Cobalt and iodine?
- Precisely.

726
01:20:29,760 --> 01:20:32,399
lf you explode it in Fort Knox, the...

727
01:20:33,840 --> 01:20:37,992
..entire gold supply of the United States
will be radioactive for...

728
01:20:38,120 --> 01:20:40,076
..57 years.

729
01:20:40,200 --> 01:20:41,918
58, to be exact.

730
01:20:42,720 --> 01:20:46,395
l apologise, Goldfinger.
lt's an inspired deal.

731
01:20:46,520 --> 01:20:49,478
They get what they want -
economic chaos in the West.

732
01:20:49,600 --> 01:20:52,398
And the value of your gold
increases many times.

733
01:20:52,520 --> 01:20:55,956
l conservatively estimate... ten times.

734
01:20:56,080 --> 01:20:58,036
Brilliant.

735
01:20:59,720 --> 01:21:02,553
But the atomic device, as you call it,

736
01:21:02,680 --> 01:21:05,831
is already, obviously, in this country.

737
01:21:05,960 --> 01:21:07,518
Obviously.

738
01:21:08,600 --> 01:21:12,149
But bringing it to Fort Knox undetected

739
01:21:12,280 --> 01:21:14,191
could be risky. Very risky.

740
01:21:14,320 --> 01:21:16,993
On the contrary, Mr Bond.
The risk is all on your side.

741
01:21:17,120 --> 01:21:20,078
If the authorities
should attempt to locate it,

742
01:21:20,200 --> 01:21:22,589
who knows where
it might be exploded?

743
01:21:22,720 --> 01:21:25,792
Perhaps the Polaris submarine pens
at New London,

744
01:21:26,640 --> 01:21:28,471
Cape Kennedy,

745
01:21:28,600 --> 01:21:30,431
near the White House.

746
01:21:30,560 --> 01:21:34,519
But we are speculating idly.
Operation Grand Slam will be successful.

747
01:21:34,640 --> 01:21:36,676
You will be there to see for yourself.

748
01:21:36,800 --> 01:21:38,791
Too closely for comfort, l'm afraid.

749
01:21:49,960 --> 01:21:51,916
Forgive me, Mr Bond,

750
01:21:52,040 --> 01:21:55,191
but l must arrange
to separate my gold from the late Mr Solo.

751
01:21:56,320 --> 01:21:58,959
As you said,
he had a pressing engagement.

752
01:22:00,040 --> 01:22:01,268
Very chic, Miss Galore.
Don't you agree?

753
01:22:03,880 --> 01:22:04,915
Please entertain Mr Bond for me, Pussy.

754
01:22:05,040 --> 01:22:06,996
I'll join you both later.

755
01:22:12,280 --> 01:22:14,236
How about it, handsome?

756
01:22:14,360 --> 01:22:17,477
Don't you think it's time
we got to know each other socially?

757
01:22:17,600 --> 01:22:19,556
The new Miss Galore.

758
01:22:19,680 --> 01:22:22,353
Where do you hide your gold knuckles
in this outfit?

759
01:22:22,480 --> 01:22:25,313
I never carry weapons
aFTer business hours.

760
01:22:25,440 --> 01:22:27,396
Yeah? So you're off duty?

761
01:22:28,120 --> 01:22:30,076
I'm completely defenceless.

762
01:22:31,040 --> 01:22:32,951
So am I.

763
01:22:38,720 --> 01:22:40,915
That's my James!

764
01:22:41,040 --> 01:22:43,349
Beautiful place Goldfinger has here.

765
01:22:43,480 --> 01:22:45,675
Yes, I'm glad you're enjoying it.

766
01:22:45,800 --> 01:22:48,872
Too bad it all has to end
tomorrow morning.

767
01:22:50,200 --> 01:22:52,919
He's quite mad, you know.

768
01:22:54,240 --> 01:22:57,073
Well, now. What do we have here?

769
01:22:58,160 --> 01:23:01,596
007 seems to have the situation
well in hand.

770
01:23:01,720 --> 01:23:04,598
Come on, I'm bushed.
Let's get back to the motel.

771
01:23:04,720 --> 01:23:07,917
- You're quite a girl, Pussy.
- I'm strictly the outdoor type.

772
01:23:08,040 --> 01:23:11,396
I'd like to think
you're not in all of this... caper.

773
01:23:12,040 --> 01:23:14,508
Skip it. I'm not interested. Let's go.

774
01:23:14,640 --> 01:23:17,598
What would it take
for you to see things my way?

775
01:23:17,720 --> 01:23:19,950
A lot more than you've got.

776
01:23:20,080 --> 01:23:23,675
- How do you know?
- I don't want to know.

777
01:23:25,520 --> 01:23:28,990
Isn't it customary to grant
a condemned man his last request?

778
01:23:29,120 --> 01:23:31,076
You've asked for this.

779
01:23:38,400 --> 01:23:40,356
Get up!

780
01:23:41,360 --> 01:23:43,316
Certainly.

781
01:23:58,560 --> 01:24:00,232
There.

782
01:24:00,360 --> 01:24:02,316
Now let's both play.

783
01:24:29,120 --> 01:24:31,270
Pussy Galore to Champagne leader.

784
01:24:31,400 --> 01:24:33,834
Commence Rockabye Baby. Good luck!

785
01:24:55,520 --> 01:24:57,476
Speed: 220.

786
01:24:57,640 --> 01:24:59,995
Wind check: westerly.

787
01:25:11,680 --> 01:25:15,389
Champagne leader to Champagne
section. Commence dive... now.

788
01:25:24,160 --> 01:25:26,116
Ready for Rockabye Baby.

789
01:25:26,240 --> 01:25:28,117
Commence spray on countdown.

790
01:25:28,240 --> 01:25:29,559
Five,

791
01:25:29,680 --> 01:25:32,752
four, three, t<i>w</i>o,

792
01:25:32,880 --> 01:25:33,915
zero.

793
01:27:14,120 --> 01:27:16,714
Champagne leader
to Grand Slam task force leader.

794
01:27:16,840 --> 01:27:18,751
The baby is asleep.

795
01:27:18,880 --> 01:27:22,350
l repeat, the baby is asleep.
We're going home no<i>w</i>.

796
01:27:22,480 --> 01:27:24,436
Out.

797
01:31:40,640 --> 01:31:42,596
Good morning, Mr Bond.

798
01:31:42,720 --> 01:31:45,154
For once,
you are exactly where l want you.

799
01:32:49,800 --> 01:32:52,519
- The bomb's here.
- Let's get moving, Brigadier.

800
01:32:52,640 --> 01:32:55,837
- Right, Jack, move in.
- Move in, commando tactics.

801
01:32:55,960 --> 01:32:59,430
Minimum offensive fire until I signal
bomb has been neutralised.

802
01:32:59,560 --> 01:33:03,348
Minimum offensive fire
until I signal bomb has been neutralised.

803
01:33:03,480 --> 01:33:05,755
Bomb disposal unit to accompany DOG.

804
01:33:38,920 --> 01:33:41,229
Goodbye, Mr Bond.

805
01:34:13,800 --> 01:34:15,677
Mr Ling, it is merely timing...

806
01:34:47,400 --> 01:34:49,356
He's one of them, so is the girl.

807
01:34:49,480 --> 01:34:51,436
I'll get her, you get the door open.

808
01:35:03,560 --> 01:35:05,278
We're trapped!

809
01:35:05,400 --> 01:35:08,278
The bomb... I'll take the fuse out.

810
01:35:09,960 --> 01:35:11,916
Don't be a fool!

811
01:35:12,040 --> 01:35:13,996
You can be a hero, I'm not!

812
01:35:17,040 --> 01:35:18,951
No, no!

813
01:40:26,360 --> 01:40:28,999
Keep going! Hurry up!

814
01:40:47,680 --> 01:40:50,274
What kept you?

815
01:40:50,400 --> 01:40:52,550
You OK, James?
Where's your butler friend?

816
01:40:52,680 --> 01:40:54,636
He blew a fuse.

817
01:40:55,480 --> 01:40:58,836
Three more ticks and Mr Goldfinger
would've hit the jackpot.

818
01:40:58,960 --> 01:41:01,394
- Did you get him?
- Not yet, but he won't get far.

819
01:41:01,520 --> 01:41:04,512
- And Pussy?
- She helped to switch the canisters.

820
01:41:04,640 --> 01:41:07,200
By the way,
what made her call Washington?

821
01:41:09,600 --> 01:41:12,433
I must have appealed
to her maternal instincts.

822
01:41:19,480 --> 01:41:21,118
Come on, James. Get aboard.
You can't keep the President waiting.

823
01:41:23,720 --> 01:41:25,676
Special plane, lunch at the White House.
How come?

824
01:41:25,800 --> 01:41:28,155
The President wants
to thank you personally.

825
01:41:28,280 --> 01:41:31,556
- It was nothing, really.
- I know that, but he doesn't.

826
01:41:32,280 --> 01:41:34,589
I suppose I'll be able to get a drink here.

827
01:41:34,720 --> 01:41:36,711
I told the stewardess liquor for three.

828
01:41:36,840 --> 01:41:39,354
- Who are the other two?
- There are no other two.

829
01:41:39,480 --> 01:41:41,596
- Goodbye, Felix.
- So long. Good luck.

830
01:41:41,720 --> 01:41:43,676
- Thank you, Brigadier.
- Good luck.

831
01:42:14,120 --> 01:42:16,270
I'm glad to have you aboard, Mr Bond.

832
01:42:16,400 --> 01:42:20,075
Well, congratulations
on your promotion, Goldfinger.

833
01:42:20,880 --> 01:42:25,032
- Are you going to the White House, too?
- In two hours l shall be in Cuba.

834
01:42:26,560 --> 01:42:29,677
You have interfered with my plans
for the last time, Mr Bond.

835
01:42:29,800 --> 01:42:33,713
It's very dangerous to fire guns in planes.
I even had to warn Pussy about it.

836
01:42:33,840 --> 01:42:37,958
- By the way, where is she?
- I will deal with her later.

837
01:42:38,080 --> 01:42:40,548
She is where she ought to be...
at the controls.

838
01:43:25,160 --> 01:43:26,388
Pussy!

839
01:43:28,480 --> 01:43:31,950
- What happened? Where's Goldfinger?
- Playing his golden harp.

840
01:43:34,200 --> 01:43:36,236
It's no good.

841
01:44:09,120 --> 01:44:11,076
Oh, no, you don't!

842
01:44:12,360 --> 01:44:14,316
This is no time to be rescued.
