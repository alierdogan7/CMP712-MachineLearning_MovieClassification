<i>Ever had one of those nights</i>

3
00:00:32,466 --> 00:00:37,376
<i>that starts out like any other, but ends
up being the best night of your life?</i>

4
00:00:41,408 --> 00:00:46,216
<font color=#FF551>GARY:</font> <i>It was June the 22nd,
1990, our final day of school.</i>

5
00:00:46,246 --> 00:00:52,488
<i>There was Oliver Chamberlain, Peter Page,
Steven Prince, Andy Knightley and me.</i>

6
00:00:52,753 --> 00:00:57,368
<i>They called me The King.
Because my name's Gary King.</i>

7
00:00:57,491 --> 00:01:02,161
<i>Ollie was funny, he fancied himself as a bit
of a player, but really, he was all mouth.</i>

8
00:01:02,162 --> 00:01:03,629
<i>We called him O-Man</i>

9
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:06,465
<i>because he had a birthmark on his
forehead that looked like a six.</i>

10
00:01:06,466 --> 00:01:08,646
<i>He loved it.</i>

11
00:01:08,735 --> 00:01:10,836
<i>Pete was the baby of the group.</i>

12
00:01:10,837 --> 00:01:14,473
<i>He wasn't the kind of kid we'd usually hang
out with, but he was good for a laugh.</i>

13
00:01:14,474 --> 00:01:17,416
<i>And he was absolutely minted.</i>

14
00:01:18,345 --> 00:01:23,015
<i>Steve was a pretty cool guy. We
jammed together, chased the girls.</i>

15
00:01:23,016 --> 00:01:26,285
<i>I think he saw us as rivals.</i>
<font color=#ff00ff>[CHUCKLES]</font> <i>Sweet, really.</i>

16
00:01:26,286 --> 00:01:29,355
<i>And Andy. Andy was my wingman.</i>

17
00:01:29,356 --> 00:01:32,358
<i>The one guy I could rely on to back me up.</i>

18
00:01:32,359 --> 00:01:36,063
<i>He loved me, and I'm not being
funny, but I loved him, too.</i>

19
00:01:36,730 --> 00:01:39,465
<i>There was nothing we were
gonna miss about school.</i>

20
00:01:39,466 --> 00:01:40,733
<i>Maybe Mr. Shepherd.</i>

21
00:01:40,734 --> 00:01:42,434
<i>He was definitely one of the good guys.</i>

22
00:01:42,435 --> 00:01:44,945
<i>He used to ask me what
I wanted to do with my life,</i>

23
00:01:45,038 --> 00:01:46,998
<i>I told him I just wanted
to have a good time.</i>

24
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,909
<i>He thought that was funny.
It wasn't meant to be.</i>

25
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:51,453
<i>Not that night.</i>

26
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:57,383
<i>Newton Haven was our hometown.
Our playground, our universe.</i>

27
00:01:57,384 --> 00:02:00,386
<i>And that night it was the
site of a heroic quest.</i>

28
00:02:00,387 --> 00:02:03,455
<i>The aim? To conquer The Golden Mile.</i>

29
00:02:03,456 --> 00:02:07,693
<i>Twelve pubs along a legendary
path of alcoholic Indulgence.</i>

30
00:02:07,694 --> 00:02:09,728
<i>There was The First Post, The Old Familiar,</i>

31
00:02:09,729 --> 00:02:12,331
<i>The Famous Cock, The Cross
Hands, The Good Companions,</i>

32
00:02:12,332 --> 00:02:15,467
<i>The Trusty Servant, The Two Headed
Dog, The Mermaid, The Beehive,</i>

33
00:02:15,468 --> 00:02:17,036
<i>The King's Head, The Hole in the Wall...</i>

34
00:02:17,037 --> 00:02:21,440
<i>All before reaching our
destiny, The World's End.</i>

35
00:02:21,441 --> 00:02:22,842
<i>We took my car into town.</i>

36
00:02:22,843 --> 00:02:26,115
<i>I called it The Beast
because she was pretty hairy.</i>

37
00:02:26,446 --> 00:02:29,081
<i>And so, our journey into manhood began.</i>
<font color=#ff00ff>[RINGS DOORBELL]</font>

38
00:02:29,082 --> 00:02:31,851
<i>We were off. We didn't waste any time.</i>

39
00:02:31,852 --> 00:02:34,157
<i>We hit pub one and we hit it hard.</i>

40
00:02:34,387 --> 00:02:37,690
<i>There was drinking, there was
fun, there was controversy,</i>

41
00:02:37,691 --> 00:02:40,593
<i>there were ladies, there
were shots, there was drama,</i>

42
00:02:40,594 --> 00:02:43,707
<i>and of course, there was drinking.</i>

43
00:02:45,432 --> 00:02:47,566
<i>By pub five, we were feeling invincible</i>

44
00:02:47,567 --> 00:02:50,002
<i>and decided to purchase
some herbal refreshment</i>

45
00:02:50,003 --> 00:02:52,872
<i>from a man we called The Reverend Green.</i>

46
00:02:52,873 --> 00:02:56,242
<i>Pint six put O-Man out of commission,
so we carried on without him.</i>

47
00:02:56,243 --> 00:02:58,911
<i>Good thing, I bumped into
his sister in the next pub,</i>

48
00:02:58,912 --> 00:03:01,854
<i>we went into the disableds
and I bumped into her again.</i>

49
00:03:01,882 --> 00:03:05,084
<i>Sam tagged along for a while,
but then I had to let her go.</i>

50
00:03:05,085 --> 00:03:08,994
<i>I had another date that night
and her name was Amber.</i>

51
00:03:09,689 --> 00:03:12,825
<i>Nine pints in and it was us against the world.</i>

52
00:03:12,826 --> 00:03:14,293
<i>Things got mental in The Beehive,</i>

53
00:03:14,294 --> 00:03:15,828
<i>so we repaired to the bowls club</i>

54
00:03:15,829 --> 00:03:21,274
<i>or as we liked to call it, The Smokehouse,
which is when it all went fuck up.</i>

55
00:03:21,534 --> 00:03:24,503
<i>Everyone got para and Pete chucked
a whitey, so we had to bench him.</i>

56
00:03:24,504 --> 00:03:27,776
<i>In the end, we blew off the last
three pubs and headed for the hills.</i>

57
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:32,211
<i>I remember sitting up there,</i>

58
00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:35,347
<i>blood on my knuckles, beer down
my shirt, sick on my shoes,</i>

59

<i>seeing the orange glow
of a new dawn break</i>

60
00:03:37,851 --> 00:03:41,897
<i>and knowing in my heart, life
would never feel this good again.</i>

61
00:03:42,956 --> 00:03:44,156

Uh... No. I'm afraid the end is nigh.

100

- The World's End.

102
00:06:38,865 --> 00:06:42,601
You know what I mean. One night.
Five guys. Twelve pubs.

00:06:42,602 --> 00:06:44,036
Let battle commence.

104
00:06:44,037 --> 00:06:45,237

- Look. Peter.

107

we're gonna see it through to the bitter end.

00:06:56,116 --> 00:06:58,884
- Even Andy?
- Why wouldn't Andy be coming?

- Not an issue. He's in.

113
00:07:04,224 --> 00:07:06,165

- My wife.

115
00:07:07,894 --> 00:07:10,596

- We divorced 10 years ago.

133
00:07:58,278 --> 00:08:00,112

134
00:08:00,113 --> 00:08:02,648
She's doing very well, apparently.

135
00:08:02,649 --> 00:08:04,049
Have you got anyone else on the go?

136
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:07,753
Yeah, I do, as it happens. She's a
fitness instructor. Twenty-six.

137
00:08:07,754 --> 00:08:10,956
Pedophile. I'm kidding.
I'd love to meet her sometime.

138
00:08:10,957 --> 00:08:12,124
No. Why are you here?

139
00:08:12,125 --> 00:08:15,932
Haven't you heard? We're
getting the band back together.

140
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:17,963
I'm not your bass player anymore.

141
00:08:17,964 --> 00:08:20,032
No, I mean we're getting the boys back together.

142
00:08:20,033 --> 00:08:21,767
We can get the band back
together as well if you want.

143
00:08:21,768 --> 00:08:25,503
No, we can't. You sold my guitar to buy drugs.

144
00:08:25,504 --> 00:08:28,640
I've always wondered, what's
that thing over the door called?

145
00:08:28,641 --> 00:08:29,575
That's a lintel.

146
00:08:29,576 --> 00:08:32,644
So, the plan is, we're going
to go back to Newton Haven,

147
00:08:32,645 --> 00:08:33,845
we are gonna do The Golden Mile

148
00:08:33,846 --> 00:08:36,815

make it to The World's End.

What is this all about, Gary?

157
00:08:54,634 --> 00:08:57,135
It's about closure, you know.

158
00:08:57,136 --> 00:09:00,305
Why should getting older affect
something as important as friendship?

159
00:09:00,306 --> 00:09:03,350
- A let's changed since then, Oliver.
- Right.

160
00:09:03,610 --> 00:09:06,011
This is our chance to take stock.

161
00:09:06,012 --> 00:09:08,192
A stock take?
You make it sound so much fun.

162
00:09:08,248 --> 00:09:10,315
Come on, O-Man. Isn't that something you'd like?

163
00:09:10,316 --> 00:09:12,784
What I'd really like is for you
to take your DMs off the sofa.

164
00:09:12,785 --> 00:09:15,887
Look. If you're worried about
me, don't be. All right?

165
00:09:15,888 --> 00:09:19,024
I'm here to tell you that Gary
King is back on the horse.

166
00:09:19,025 --> 00:09:21,927
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
You're back on the horse?

167
00:09:21,928 --> 00:09:23,095
No, I mean I'm back on the bike.

168
00:09:23,096 --> 00:09:24,263
- What is bike?
- What do you mean?

169
00:09:24,264 --> 00:09:25,931
- What is bike slang for?
- Bicycle.

170
00:09:25,932 --> 00:09:27,032
- I'm lost.
- Don't be.

171
00:09:27,033 --> 00:09:28,267
- Okay.
- Listen.

172
00:09:28,268 --> 00:09:31,036
This is our chance to finally
finish what we started.

173
00:09:31,037 --> 00:09:33,877
Come on, man, it'll be fucking mental!

174
00:09:34,841 --> 00:09:36,675
I think we're all done. So...

175
00:09:36,676 --> 00:09:38,210
How do you like the property?

176
00:09:38,211 --> 00:09:40,212
Yeah. It's amazing.
Amazing location.

177
00:09:40,213 --> 00:09:41,947
Fantastic.
Fantastic aspects.

178
00:09:41,948 --> 00:09:44,783
It's just... It's just a little
bit out of our price range.

179
00:09:44,784 --> 00:09:46,718
- He'll knock some off for you.
- What's it down for?

180
00:09:46,719 --> 00:09:48,687
- 1.2 million.
- Fuck off!

181

<font color=#ff00ff>[SIGHS]</font>

182
00:09:51,557 --> 00:09:53,358
You have my card.

183
00:09:53,359 --> 00:09:55,560
Gary, WTF?

184
00:09:55,561 --> 00:09:57,129
It's good to see you, too, O-Man.

185
00:09:57,130 --> 00:09:58,764
- Please don't call me O-Man.
- Sure.

186
00:09:58,765 --> 00:10:00,666
- Hey, how's your sister?
- She's fine.

187
00:10:00,667 --> 00:10:01,867
- She talk about me?
- No.

188
00:10:01,868 --> 00:10:03,735
So, Friday, we'll all go down together.

189
00:10:03,736 --> 00:10:05,237
Make a road trip of it, I'll drive.

190
00:10:05,238 --> 00:10:07,918
Don't think I can. I think I've
got a doctor's appointment.

191
00:10:07,974 --> 00:10:09,619
Yeah, you do. With Dr. Ink!

192
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:13,679
- You know, Dr. Ink?
- Yeah. "Drink." I get it.

193
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:16,515
Come on. It wouldn't be the
same without the O-Man.

194
00:10:16,516 --> 00:10:17,549
Jesus.

195
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:21,520
You can see the guys, see how they're
doing. Tell them how you're doing.

196
00:10:21,521 --> 00:10:24,201
You never know, you might
make it to the end this time.

197
00:10:24,957 --> 00:10:27,467
- And Andy's definitely coming?
- Yeah.

198
00:10:28,328 --> 00:10:30,929
- Andy Knightley?
- Totes.

199
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:33,269
And you convinced him how?

<font color=#ff00ff>[ELEVATOR BELL DINGS]</font>

201
00:10:37,236 --> 00:10:39,404
- Mr. Knightley.
- Felicity.

202
00:10:39,405 --> 00:10:41,312
You have a friend hereto see you.

203
00:10:43,876 --> 00:10:45,487
No, I don't.

- Yup.

206
00:10:51,751 --> 00:10:54,286
- Saw the boys the other day.
- Mmm-hmm.

207
00:10:54,287 --> 00:10:57,627
O-Man, Stevie-Baby, the Petertron.

208
00:10:58,324 --> 00:11:01,793
Yeah, I remember the names of
our childhood friends, Gary.

209
00:11:01,794 --> 00:11:04,963
We had ourselves a little idea.

210
00:11:04,964 --> 00:11:06,064
Did you now?

211
00:11:06,065 --> 00:11:07,799
Yeah. We're going to go back to Newton Haven.

212
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:12,142
- Why?
- For some unfinished business.

213
00:11:13,906 --> 00:11:15,440
That's a joke, right?

214
00:11:15,441 --> 00:11:19,277
- Five guys. Twelve pubs. Fifty pints.
- Sixty pints.

215
00:11:19,278 --> 00:11:21,279
<font color=#ff00ff>[LAUGHS]</font> Steady on,
you fucking alky.

216
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:23,515
I haven't had a drink for 16 years, Gary.

217
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:25,484
- You must be thirsty then.
<font color=#ff00ff>- [SIGHS]</font>

218
00:11:25,485 --> 00:11:28,787
We can go back, see the guys, chew
the fat, it'll be just like it always was,

219
00:11:28,788 --> 00:11:31,723
except this time we're going to
finish this thing once and for all.

220
00:11:31,724 --> 00:11:34,426
- You have a very selective memory, Gary.
- Thanks.

221
00:11:34,427 --> 00:11:36,161
You remember the Friday nights.

222
00:11:36,162 --> 00:11:37,362
I remember the Monday mornings.

223
00:11:37,363 --> 00:11:39,634
Yeah, that's why we're
going back on a Friday.

224
00:11:39,799 --> 00:11:42,534
<font color=#ff00ff>[SIGHS]</font> Why do you think none of
us live in Newton Haven anymore?

225
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:46,104
- I don't know.
- Because it's a black hole. It's boring.

226
00:11:46,105 --> 00:11:47,973
It always was and it always will be.

227
00:11:47,974 --> 00:11:50,475
It's only boring because we're not there.

228
00:11:50,476 --> 00:11:53,478
- It's pointless arguing with you.
- Exactly. So come.

229
00:11:53,479 --> 00:11:57,215
I'm picking everybody up from High
Wycombe station, Friday, 3:00 sharp.

230
00:11:57,216 --> 00:11:58,283
No, Gary.

231
00:11:58,284 --> 00:12:00,685
Oh, God, why? Have you got
to check with your missus?

232
00:12:00,686 --> 00:12:04,197
No, actually, I don't have to check with my missus.

233
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:07,670
- What are you doing?
- I'm showing you the door.

234
00:12:08,528 --> 00:12:10,762
Is it a door? It doesn't have a lintel.

235
00:12:10,763 --> 00:12:13,965
And it's glass. So is it a window or is it a dour?

236
00:12:13,966 --> 00:12:18,170
Maybe it's a windoor.
<font color=#ff00ff>[CHUCKLES]</font> You can have that.

237
00:12:18,171 --> 00:12:19,679
Please leave, Gary.

238
00:12:20,473 --> 00:12:21,674
<font color=#ff00ff>[SIGHS]</font>

239
00:12:22,308 --> 00:12:25,819
All right. All right.

240
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:30,258
£600, wasn't it?

241
00:12:33,352 --> 00:12:37,193
- Oh, urn, I thought you should know.
- What?

242
00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:39,357
Mum died.

243
00:12:39,358 --> 00:12:41,595
- When?
- Couple of weeks ago.

244
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:44,706
The big cancer.

245
00:12:44,864 --> 00:12:46,065
<font color=#ff00ff>[SIGHS]</font>

246
00:12:46,466 --> 00:12:47,736
I'm sorry.

247
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:50,335
She just always really liked you, you know.

248
00:12:50,336 --> 00:12:52,704
Got me thinking about the old days.

249
00:12:52,705 --> 00:12:55,283
Particularly that night, you know,
because we were so happy.

250
00:12:55,908 --> 00:12:59,578
And, you know, I love the boys like brothers,

251
00:12:59,579 --> 00:13:04,118
but when all's said and done,
you're the best friend I ever had.

252
00:13:05,685 --> 00:13:08,092
It was good to see you, mate.

253
00:13:19,966 --> 00:13:21,233
Pete?

254
00:13:21,234 --> 00:13:23,068
Steven. Thank God.

255
00:13:23,069 --> 00:13:25,003
I had a horrible feeling I was
going to be the only one here.

256
00:13:25,004 --> 00:13:27,706
I reckon that's not the last horrible
feeling you're gonna have today, mate.

257
00:13:27,707 --> 00:13:28,907
This can't be happening. Can it?

258
00:13:28,908 --> 00:13:30,842
You said it. What the hell are we doing here?

259
00:13:30,843 --> 00:13:32,344
What we always did.

260
00:13:32,345 --> 00:13:35,080
Follow Gary King into almost certain oblivion.

261
00:13:35,081 --> 00:13:36,348
Hello, Steven.

262
00:13:36,349 --> 00:13:37,549
You all right, mate?

263
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:39,117
Pete. Hi, mate.

264
00:13:39,118 --> 00:13:42,454
Didn't we decide to stop calling him
Fearless Leader somewhere around 1992?

265
00:13:42,455 --> 00:13:43,722
Old habits die hard.

266
00:13:43,723 --> 00:13:45,290
They'll be putting that on Gary's tombstone.

267
00:13:45,291 --> 00:13:47,025
No, they won't. You know he'll outlive us all.

268
00:13:47,026 --> 00:13:48,760
That's! be funny if it wasn't true.

269
00:13:48,761 --> 00:13:50,729
- Hang on a sec.
- What?

270
00:13:50,730 --> 00:13:53,932
I'm just trying to decide which of
us is the biggest idiot for coming.

271

<font color=#ff00ff>[WHISTLING]</font>

272
00:14:00,973 --> 00:14:03,642
Maybe he had an accident. Oh, sorry, Andy.

273
00:14:03,643 --> 00:14:06,044
Sorry. No, no, no. It's fine.

274
00:14:06,045 --> 00:14:07,312
I think Gary having an accident

275
00:14:07,313 --> 00:14:10,187
would actually be the best outcome
for all of us, including Gary.

- You're late.
- No, I'm not.

282
00:14:24,330 --> 00:14:26,998
Yeah, you are. You said 3:00. It's almost 4:00.

283
00:14:26,999 --> 00:14:28,400
Yeah, 3 for 4.

284
00:14:28,401 --> 00:14:30,335
You know your problem, Gary?
You're never wrong.

285
00:14:30,336 --> 00:14:31,436
How is that a problem?

286
00:14:31,437 --> 00:14:33,371
I can't believe you bought
another Granada Mark II.

287
00:14:33,372 --> 00:14:34,439
What do you mean?

288
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:37,075
This looks exactly like
the car I sold you in 1989.

289

This is the car you sold me in 1989.
Best 300 quid I ever spent.

- This is The Beast?
- Yeah.

291
00:14:42,014 --> 00:14:44,049
Pretty much. I mean, she's
had a bit of work done.

292
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:47,252
I had to replace the brakes,
suspension, exhaust, seats, wheels,

293
00:14:47,253 --> 00:14:50,655
paneling, carburetor, manifold, the whole
engine, really, mirrors, headlamps.

294
00:14:50,656 --> 00:14:53,191
Other than that, she's the same old motor.

Well, nobody knows how many there
were, really, do they, Pete?

310

died and they'd still have three left.

00:16:21,814 --> 00:16:23,315
If it is a piss.

325
00:16:23,916 --> 00:16:26,484
- Might be a little...
- Poo.

326
00:16:26,485 --> 00:16:28,053
How is that a poo?

327
00:16:28,054 --> 00:16:31,756
- Still work for your old man, Pete?
- Yeah. I'm a partner now.

328
00:16:31,757 --> 00:16:32,824
You?

329
00:16:32,825 --> 00:16:36,928
Yeah, started my own firm in '98.
Got bought out in '05.

330
00:16:36,929 --> 00:16:38,797
I'm happier, though. It's less stress.

331
00:16:38,798 --> 00:16:40,331
- Ollie?
- Property.

332
00:16:40,332 --> 00:16:43,868
I co-manage a boutique estate
agency in North London.

333
00:16:43,869 --> 00:16:45,103
Very competitive.

334
00:16:45,104 --> 00:16:48,039
- Is it family law you're in, Andy?
- Corporate.

335
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:49,307
Does anyone know what Gary's doing?

336
00:16:49,308 --> 00:16:51,209
He's playing <i>Need For Speed.</i> Over there.

337
00:16:51,210 --> 00:16:53,545
Come on, come on, come on!

338
00:16:53,546 --> 00:16:54,786
He hasn't changed, has he?

339
00:16:55,481 --> 00:16:59,720
I don't know. He did finally
pay me back that £600.

340
00:16:59,785 --> 00:17:02,989
- Really? He borrowed £200 off me.
- And me.

341
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:07,764

I can't believe you'd do that!

342
00:17:08,894 --> 00:17:10,161
Oh! Of course I can.

343
00:17:10,162 --> 00:17:12,239
It's just robbing Peter to pay Paul.

344
00:17:12,331 --> 00:17:16,001
No, I borrowed it from Peter to pay you.
I still owe Paul. <font color=#ff00ff>[LAUGHS]</font>

And I left that at the bloody gym!

364
00:18:16,195 --> 00:18:20,832
- Any other form of identification?
- No, it's all in my sports bag.

That's bloody typical, isn't it? Um...

366
00:18:23,402 --> 00:18:26,504
I'll give you my name and address, you
can run me through the old system.

It's Peter Page.

369
00:18:29,675 --> 00:18:34,756
48 Bishop's Gardens, London, N2 T12.

370
00:18:37,283 --> 00:18:40,318
Jesus, Gary! WTF?
Why did you give him my name?

371
00:18:40,319 --> 00:18:41,920
I'm not gonna give him my name, am I?

372
00:18:41,921 --> 00:18:43,288
Suppose I get done by the police?

373
00:18:43,289 --> 00:18:44,756
You won't get done by the police.

374
00:18:44,757 --> 00:18:46,758
Gary, he will check the number
plate against his name!

375
00:18:46,759 --> 00:18:48,393
I know. Why do you think
I gave him Pete's name?

376
00:18:48,394 --> 00:18:51,296

So, Mr. Page, what brings

Well, we're all from here. We're
just back to see the sights.

381
00:19:01,207 --> 00:19:03,208
Have a crack at the old Golden Mile.

<font color=#ff00ff>[CHUCKLES]</font>

Well, you make sure you get
that brake light fixed

384
00:19:06,745 --> 00:19:09,551
and you might want to do
an emissions test, too.

385
00:19:10,082 --> 00:19:11,349
Oh, and, Peter.

386
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:12,790

It's simple, Pete.

392
00:19:20,426 --> 00:19:23,428
The car's still registered to
you, it has been since 1989.

393
00:19:23,429 --> 00:19:24,863
But I've moved three times since then.

394
00:19:24,864 --> 00:19:26,431

407
00:20:05,437 --> 00:20:08,206
Commencing with an inaugural
tankard at The First Post,

408
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:11,376
then onto The Old Familiar, The
Famous Cock, The Cross Hands,

The Good Companions,
The Trusty Servant,

410

The Two Headed Dog, The Mermaid,
The Beehive, The King's Head

411
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:17,115
and The Hole in the Wall
for a measure of the same.

412
00:20:17,116 --> 00:20:20,985
All before the last bittersweet
pint in that most fateful terminus,

413
00:20:20,986 --> 00:20:22,253
The World's End.

414

came back from the Battle of Hastings,

- fucking rocked up at Arthur's Castle...
- Camelot.

"Hello. Could I have a tap water?"

No, because they didn't have

Exactly. He would have had a mead.
The King Arthur of beers.

486
00:24:44,950 --> 00:24:47,585
Imagine that? A French kid.

487
00:24:47,586 --> 00:24:49,390
It's pointless arguing with you.

488
00:24:49,454 --> 00:24:51,861
To kids. Wherever they may be.

489
00:24:52,591 --> 00:24:53,792
- Kids.
- Kids.

490
00:24:56,562 --> 00:24:58,366
Drink up. Let's Boo-Boo.

491
00:24:58,597 --> 00:25:02,166
- "Boo-Boo". What is that?
- You remember, "Let's Boo-Boo."

492
00:25:02,167 --> 00:25:04,268
You know, from Mr. Shepherd's
classroom, it said on the wall,

493
00:25:04,269 --> 00:25:06,871
"Exit, pursued by a bear," you
know, from that Shakespeare play?

494
00:25:06,872 --> 00:25:08,706
- <i>A Winter's Tale.</i>
- Yeah. What was it called?

495
00:25:08,707 --> 00:25:10,041
- <i>A Winter's Tale.</i>
- That's it.

496
00:25:10,042 --> 00:25:13,144
And if we needed to make a quick getaway,
we'd say, "Exit, pursued by a bear,"

497
00:25:13,145 --> 00:25:15,246
and then it was, "Exit, pursued by Yogi Bear,"

498
00:25:15,247 --> 00:25:17,081
and then it was just, "Let's Yogi and Boo-Boo,"

499
00:25:17,082 --> 00:25:18,482
and then, "Let's Boo-Boo."

500
00:25:18,483 --> 00:25:21,003
- So you're saying we should go?
- Yeah. it's shit here, innit?

501
00:25:25,791 --> 00:25:26,992
<font color=#FF551>GARY:</font> Ah!

502
00:25:27,559 --> 00:25:33,004
The Old Familiar. Now this is a pub.

503
00:25:35,467 --> 00:25:38,238
<font color=#ff00ff>[LAUGHS]</font>
Yes. This is more like it.

504
00:25:39,171 --> 00:25:40,816
<font color=#ff00ff>[TV PLAYING INDISTINCTLY]</font>

505
00:25:41,106 --> 00:25:42,478
Like déjà vu.

506
00:25:42,975 --> 00:25:49,113
David, my man, have you heard the news?
Gary King is back in town.

507
00:25:49,114 --> 00:25:50,049
Who's he?

508
00:26:03,395 --> 00:26:04,596
<font color=#ff00ff>[BURPS]</font>

509
00:26:05,530 --> 00:26:07,073
How was the funeral, Gary?

510
00:26:09,368 --> 00:26:10,706
Your mum's funeral?

511
00:26:11,603 --> 00:26:13,874
It's difficult to put into words.

512
00:26:14,573 --> 00:26:18,687
But if I had to choose three, I would say,

513
00:26:19,077 --> 00:26:22,087
"Really, really sad."

514
00:26:23,015 --> 00:26:24,715
Oh, no, that's two, isn't it?

515
00:26:24,716 --> 00:26:27,692
How about, "Really, very sad"?

516
00:26:28,487 --> 00:26:31,930
It's a shame, <font color=#ff00ff>[SIGHS]</font>
she was a good woman.

517
00:26:32,591 --> 00:26:34,225
I really liked your mum.

518
00:26:34,226 --> 00:26:37,373
<font color=#ff00ff>[CHUCKLES]</font>
Me, too, mate. Me, too.

519
00:26:37,996 --> 00:26:39,930
- Hello.
- Hello, mate.

520
00:26:39,931 --> 00:26:41,032
Are you here?

521
00:26:41,033 --> 00:26:43,134
- Yeah, I've been here for ages.
- What are you talking about?

522
00:26:43,135 --> 00:26:45,246
You get lost on the ring road again?

523
00:26:45,971 --> 00:26:47,705
This is Newton Haven.

524
00:26:47,706 --> 00:26:49,640
- What time are you meeting The Twins?
- Twins?

525
00:26:49,641 --> 00:26:52,447
We're all at The Old Familiar.
Come by if you want.

526
00:26:54,079 --> 00:26:58,056
Yeah, he is. Okay. See you soon.

527
00:26:58,250 --> 00:26:59,517
Who was that, O-Man?

528
00:26:59,518 --> 00:27:04,255
Don't call me O-Man, Gary.
If you must know it was Sam.

529
00:27:04,256 --> 00:27:05,089
- Sam's here?
- Sam's here?

530
00:27:05,090 --> 00:27:08,092
Is there a fucking echo in here?
Yes, Sam's here.

531
00:27:08,093 --> 00:27:10,394
She's down from Manchester. We're
driving to Mum's tomorrow.

532
00:27:10,395 --> 00:27:11,629
What, and she's coming here?

533
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:14,065
- Calm down, Steve, I saw her first.
- Jesus Christ, not this again.

534
00:27:14,066 --> 00:27:17,935
Are you fucking kidding me?
I saw her first.

535
00:27:17,936 --> 00:27:20,438
You really have a selective
memory, don't you?

536
00:27:20,439 --> 00:27:21,906
Somebody else was saying that.

537
00:27:21,907 --> 00:27:23,774
Me. No. I would have remembered.

538
00:27:23,775 --> 00:27:25,710
I told you I had a thing about Sam

539
00:27:25,711 --> 00:27:28,279
and you proceeded to try and get
in her pants at every opportunity.

540
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:29,347
Guys, please.

541
00:27:29,348 --> 00:27:31,682
You only liked her after
you found out I liked her!

542
00:27:31,683 --> 00:27:33,551
That's right, because you did the school play.

543
00:27:33,552 --> 00:27:35,586
- Cabaret.
- Cabaret. Because she was in it.

544
00:27:35,587 --> 00:27:38,522
And she wore those fishnet stockings
and you got a big boner on stage.

545
00:27:38,523 --> 00:27:39,690
<font color=#ff00ff>[LAUGHING]</font> Jesus Christ.

546
00:27:39,691 --> 00:27:42,793
Doesn't matter anyway, she always had
a massive wide on for Adrian Keane.

547
00:27:42,794 --> 00:27:44,028
I hated that prick.

548
00:27:44,029 --> 00:27:48,766
Can we not talk about my sister in relation to,

549
00:27:48,767 --> 00:27:51,969
A, massive wide ons, B, Steven's erect penis?

550
00:27:51,970 --> 00:27:53,471
All right.

551
00:27:53,472 --> 00:27:55,652
- Is she still fit, though?
- I'm not answering that.

552
00:27:56,208 --> 00:27:57,274
Is she, though?

553
00:27:57,275 --> 00:27:59,978
- Am I what?
- Fit.

554
00:28:00,479 --> 00:28:04,014
- Hello, Sam.
- Steven? You've grown, haven't you?

555
00:28:04,015 --> 00:28:06,050
- Yeah, sideways.
- You look fantastic.

556
00:28:06,051 --> 00:28:07,518
Steroids.

557
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:10,388
Andy, longtime.

558
00:28:10,389 --> 00:28:12,022
- Hi, Pete.
- Hi, Sam.

559
00:28:12,023 --> 00:28:13,224
All right, big brother?

560
00:28:14,593 --> 00:28:15,726
Gary.

561
00:28:15,727 --> 00:28:19,163
<i>Willkommen. Bienvenue.</i> Welcome.

562
00:28:19,164 --> 00:28:20,464
Sam. Would you like a drink?

563
00:28:20,465 --> 00:28:23,267
Hey, Steve. She's just got here. Come on.

564
00:28:23,268 --> 00:28:24,468
Sam. Would you like a drink?

565
00:28:24,469 --> 00:28:26,704
- I'll have a vodka tonic, thanks, Steven.
- Sure.

566
00:28:26,705 --> 00:28:28,425
- I'm just going to nip to the loo.
- Cool.

567
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:29,641
<font color=#ff00ff>[CHUCKLES]</font>

568
00:28:29,841 --> 00:28:31,520
Nature calls.

569
00:28:38,216 --> 00:28:40,050
- What are you doing?
- What are you doing?

570
00:28:40,051 --> 00:28:42,531
- I'm going to the toilet.
- Well, then, so am I.

571
00:28:43,989 --> 00:28:45,723
Gary! You are out of your mind!

572
00:28:45,724 --> 00:28:47,324
What are you talking about?
You gave me the sign.

573
00:28:47,325 --> 00:28:50,127
- What sign?
- You went to the toilet.

574
00:28:50,128 --> 00:28:52,029
Gary, are you serious?
I haven't seen you in 20 years.

575
00:28:52,030 --> 00:28:54,632
Do you really think I'm going to have
sex with you in the ladies' toilet?

576
00:28:54,633 --> 00:28:56,367
Well, the disableds is out of order.

577
00:28:56,368 --> 00:28:58,402
- Gary. What happened?
- I don't know,

578
00:28:58,403 --> 00:29:00,671
maybe one of them put too many
paper towels down the toilet.

579
00:29:00,672 --> 00:29:03,174
I mean, we don't know what they
are thinking, really, do we?

580
00:29:03,175 --> 00:29:05,209
No. What happened to you?

581
00:29:05,210 --> 00:29:06,548
Nothing.

582
00:29:07,345 --> 00:29:09,456
Nothing happened to me.
I'm the same old Gary.

583
00:29:09,481 --> 00:29:11,558
- No shit.
- Huh!

584
00:29:11,616 --> 00:29:12,954
So, do you wanna?

585
00:29:14,686 --> 00:29:17,154
- Oliver. I'll see you later.
- You're going?

586
00:29:17,155 --> 00:29:19,356
I thought you weren't meeting The
Twins for another half hour?

587
00:29:19,357 --> 00:29:22,436
I'm not. Oh, yeah. I believe this is yours.

<font color=#ff00ff>[CHUCKLES]</font>

589
00:29:26,665 --> 00:29:31,109
"Out of order." It's a private joke.

590
00:29:31,603 --> 00:29:33,282
I don't want to know.

591
00:29:48,053 --> 00:29:50,054

593
00:29:51,156 --> 00:29:52,699

Hey. guys, do you know what time it is?

595
00:29:55,527 --> 00:29:56,794
It's not even 6:00.

00:30:03,535 --> 00:30:04,713
Let's go.

599
00:30:05,504 --> 00:30:07,308

604
00:30:25,824 --> 00:30:26,991
Do you remember? We used to come in here

605
00:30:26,992 --> 00:30:31,829
and listen to him talk about fucking UFOs
and lizard people and underwater Nazis.

606
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:33,797
<font color=#FF551>OLIVER:</font> Didn't he spout some
bullshit about the Bermuda Triangle

607
00:30:33,798 --> 00:30:34,865
actually being a square?

608
00:30:34,866 --> 00:30:38,068
No, he said it was two isosceles
triangles forming a rhombus.

609
00:30:38,069 --> 00:30:39,370
He was your best mate,
wasn't he, Steve?

610
00:30:39,371 --> 00:30:41,906
No, he wasn't my best mate, Gary.

611
00:30:41,907 --> 00:30:44,108
He was a lonely, old guy and
I felt a bit sorry for him.

612
00:30:44,109 --> 00:30:46,152
That's right. Basil!

613
00:30:48,246 --> 00:30:50,281
Maybe we're not the local
legends you think we are.

614
00:30:50,282 --> 00:30:51,949
- Gary King?
- Speak for yourself, mate.

615
00:30:51,950 --> 00:30:53,561
You're barred.

616
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:58,789
I cannot fucking believe this. This is ridiculous.

617
00:30:58,790 --> 00:30:59,957
Believe me, Gary, it's not worth it.

618
00:30:59,958 --> 00:31:02,760
Have two in the next one. Have them
all in the next one, for all I care.

619
00:31:02,761 --> 00:31:05,629
We've got to have one in every pub
otherwise the whole thing's fucked.

620
00:31:05,630 --> 00:31:07,673
I'd say it was fairly fucked already, mate.

621
00:31:07,766 --> 00:31:08,944
Great.

622
00:31:16,641 --> 00:31:18,742
How much more of this
do we have to endure?

623
00:31:18,743 --> 00:31:20,844
- That was three. There's nine more.
- Oh, good.

624
00:31:20,845 --> 00:31:22,813
Fuck that. I need to eat something.

625
00:31:22,814 --> 00:31:24,148
We can get some food in the next pub.

626
00:31:24,149 --> 00:31:26,183
As long as it's reasonably healthy.

627
00:31:26,184 --> 00:31:27,885
This is Newton Haven.

628
00:31:27,886 --> 00:31:29,853
Hardly the heart of the organic revolution.

629
00:31:29,854 --> 00:31:31,555
I doubt it's the heart of anything.

630
00:31:31,556 --> 00:31:35,426
My wife wanted us to go organic,
problem is, I kinda like eating shit.

631
00:31:35,427 --> 00:31:37,573

we said you'd been asleep for

642

Yes, I did. Something of a personal

00:32:12,964 --> 00:32:15,833
Erika Leekes, Tracy Benson, Becky Salt.

650
00:32:15,834 --> 00:32:17,768
Two blondes and a redhead in the middle.

651
00:32:17,769 --> 00:32:20,804
- The Marmalade Sandwich.
- Becky Salt. Fucking hell.

652
00:32:20,805 --> 00:32:22,039
Wonder what they're doing now.

653
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:23,240
Why don't you ask them?

654
00:32:23,241 --> 00:32:24,375
What do you mean?

655
00:32:24,376 --> 00:32:27,945
I mean, sitting at that table over there are
two blondes and a redhead in the middle.

656
00:32:27,946 --> 00:32:29,313
Shut the fuck up.

657
00:32:29,314 --> 00:32:31,649
I'd say that's Erika Leekes on the
left, Tracy Benson on the right,

658
00:32:31,650 --> 00:32:33,717
and by process of elimination,
there's Becky Salt in the middle.

659
00:32:33,718 --> 00:32:35,653
That's the Marmalade Sandwich all growed up.

660
00:32:35,654 --> 00:32:37,388
That is very spooky.
<font color=#ff00ff>[LAUGHING]</font>

661
00:32:37,389 --> 00:32:39,089
- We should get them over.
- No.

662
00:32:39,090 --> 00:32:40,624
Leave the past where it is.

663
00:32:40,625 --> 00:32:42,292
It's bad enough having to
look at your old, ugly mugs.

664
00:32:42,293 --> 00:32:44,762
You make it sound like
we're fucking ancient.

665
00:32:44,763 --> 00:32:45,796
We haven't changed that much.

666
00:32:45,797 --> 00:32:48,032
- I mean, sure, Steve's let himself go a bit.
- What?

667
00:32:48,033 --> 00:32:50,801
Pete's got the same haircut and Oliver
has still got his mark of the devil.

668
00:32:50,802 --> 00:32:52,069
No, he hasn't No, he hasn't.

669
00:32:52,070 --> 00:32:53,303
It's called laser surgery, Gary.

670
00:32:53,304 --> 00:32:55,873
It's a small price to pay for
not being called fucking O-Man.

671
00:32:55,874 --> 00:32:57,574
That works for Sisters of Mercy tattoos as well.

672
00:32:57,575 --> 00:32:59,076
I still like the Sisters Of Mercy.

673
00:32:59,077 --> 00:33:00,477
Well, good job, or you'd never go swimming.

674
00:33:00,478 --> 00:33:01,745
- I'm lost.
- Don't be.

675
00:33:01,746 --> 00:33:04,615
Well, I for one, think it's nice
to see the old faces again.

676
00:33:04,616 --> 00:33:05,849
Cheers, mate.

677
00:33:05,850 --> 00:33:07,495
Excuse me? This taken?

678
00:33:09,454 --> 00:33:10,860
Is this seat taken?

679
00:33:12,357 --> 00:33:13,627
Have it, mate.

680
00:33:13,825 --> 00:33:15,060
Thanks.

681
00:33:17,762 --> 00:33:20,397
Wasn't that... Shane Hawkins.

682
00:33:20,398 --> 00:33:22,232
- Hey, didn't he...
- Yes, he did.

683
00:33:22,233 --> 00:33:24,468
Hang on. What happened
with Shane Hawkins again?

684
00:33:24,469 --> 00:33:27,081
I'd rather not bring it all
up again, if that's okay.

685
00:33:27,972 --> 00:33:29,640
Hey, man. Listen, Pete.

686
00:33:29,641 --> 00:33:31,408
Bottling up past trauma can lead to

687
00:33:31,409 --> 00:33:34,712
inadequate coping strategies
in later life, apparently.

688
00:33:34,713 --> 00:33:37,147
I don't know, I mean, it's not
even about the past, you know.

689
00:33:37,148 --> 00:33:40,350
It's not about the fact that he bullied me,

690
00:33:40,351 --> 00:33:42,953
that he made me miss more
school days than chicken pox.

691
00:33:42,954 --> 00:33:46,590
It's not even that he forced me to spend
entire lessons hiding in a toilet cubicle,

692
00:33:46,591 --> 00:33:49,960
or that he punched me so hard
he dislodged my eyeball.

693
00:33:49,961 --> 00:33:53,063
And it's not even that he ruined
a large portion of my childhood.

694
00:33:53,064 --> 00:33:57,508
No, it's the fact that just
then, he didn't recognize me.

695
00:33:57,569 --> 00:34:01,740
He looked straight through me
like it all meant nothing.

696
00:34:02,474 --> 00:34:04,808
That probably sounds weird, doesn't it?

697
00:34:04,809 --> 00:34:06,310
Shots!

698
00:34:06,311 --> 00:34:09,613
S-H-O-T-S. Shots.

699
00:34:09,614 --> 00:34:11,020
What are you doing, Gary?

700
00:34:11,049 --> 00:34:13,150
I thought it was obvious. Shots.

701
00:34:13,151 --> 00:34:14,752
Firstly, Peter was talking about something

702
00:34:14,753 --> 00:34:16,186
which clearly made him feel very uncomfortable.

703
00:34:16,187 --> 00:34:18,689
- It's all right, Andy.
- No, Peter, it's not all right.

704
00:34:18,690 --> 00:34:23,560
Secondly, 12 pints is more than enough,
and thirdly, I don't fucking drink!

705
00:34:23,561 --> 00:34:25,596
But shots don't count, do they?

706
00:34:25,597 --> 00:34:27,364
You said you wanted
to catch up and chew the fat.

707
00:34:27,365 --> 00:34:29,399
I think you just wanted to drink it.

708
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:30,768
We're not here as your friends.

709
00:34:30,769 --> 00:34:32,642
We're just your fucking enablers.

710
00:34:32,837 --> 00:34:35,105

word, isn't it? "Enabler."

711
00:34:35,106 --> 00:34:36,840
Gary King And The Enablers.

712
00:34:36,841 --> 00:34:38,509
That's a good name for a band, Steve.
Write that down.

713
00:34:38,510 --> 00:34:39,877
Don't do a Gary, Gary.

714
00:34:39,878 --> 00:34:41,879
- Oh, is that a thing now, is it?
- It's always been a thing.

715
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:43,614
You don't need us to help you get fucked up,

716
00:34:43,615 --> 00:34:46,591
you've done a perfectly
good job so far on your own.

717
00:34:47,519 --> 00:34:49,520
I'm gonna go and see if
there's a bus back to London

718
00:34:49,521 --> 00:34:50,854
if anyone wants to come with me.

719
00:34:50,855 --> 00:34:54,725
You can't go. This is special.
This is our anniversary.

720
00:34:54,726 --> 00:34:56,126
It's not the anniversary, Gary.

721
00:34:56,127 --> 00:34:57,761
We did this in June. It's October.

722
00:34:57,762 --> 00:34:59,563
Yeah, but it's the anniversary
of the year, isn't it?

723
00:34:59,564 --> 00:35:01,465
Every year is the anniversary of a year!

724
00:35:01,466 --> 00:35:03,333
It's just not the same anymore, Gary,

725
00:35:03,334 --> 00:35:05,903
and it's not that the town's
changed, we have changed.

726
00:35:05,904 --> 00:35:08,812
Yeah, well, you can't go,
'cause the buses are finished.

727
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:11,642
Then I'm gonna go back to the B&B.
You coming?

728
00:35:11,643 --> 00:35:12,810
I could do with an early one actually.

729
00:35:12,811 --> 00:35:14,211
I should probably go and find Sam.

730
00:35:14,212 --> 00:35:16,079
Yeah, I'm gonna go
and find Sam with Oliver.

731
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:17,486
That's settled then, yeah?

732
00:35:18,750 --> 00:35:21,585
You know what I think?
I think you're jealous.

733
00:35:21,586 --> 00:35:26,723
Yeah, you've got your houses and your cars
and your wives and your job security.

734
00:35:26,724 --> 00:35:30,027
But you don't have what I have. Freedom.

735
00:35:30,028 --> 00:35:34,438
You're all slaves and I'm free
to do what I want any old time.

736
00:35:34,766 --> 00:35:36,377
And this is what you want?

737
00:35:37,068 --> 00:35:39,942
You should grow up, mate. Join society.

738
00:35:40,038 --> 00:35:42,406
Yeah, but Mum died.

739
00:35:42,407 --> 00:35:45,986
And we're all very sorry,
but now it's time to go home.

740
00:35:48,947 --> 00:35:50,990

Can you get through to Sam?

814
00:41:49,106 --> 00:41:50,807
I've got full bars and I'm not getting through.

00:41:58,216 --> 00:42:02,694
Holy shit. This is all connected.

818
00:42:03,788 --> 00:42:06,156
This explains why everything's gone fuck up.

819
00:42:06,157 --> 00:42:07,524
Everybody's been replaced by one of these.

820
00:42:07,525 --> 00:42:10,961
That's why no one recognized
us, Basil, Dave, Raymondo.

821
00:42:10,962 --> 00:42:13,597
- I thought it was weird.
- Shane Hawkins.

822
00:42:13,598 --> 00:42:17,567
Exactly. it's not us that's changed, it's the town.

823
00:42:17,568 --> 00:42:19,669
I'm right, aren't I, Andy?

824
00:42:19,670 --> 00:42:22,038
- Andy, aren't I right?
- You're never wrong.

825
00:42:22,039 --> 00:42:25,675
No, whatever the fuck's happening,
we can't stay in the gents forever.

826
00:42:25,676 --> 00:42:27,644
Ten people have entered this
toilet in the last five minutes

827
00:42:27,645 --> 00:42:29,312
and not a single one has come back out again.

828
00:42:29,313 --> 00:42:30,847
That's going to look suspicious.

- To The Trusty Servant.

Are you saying we move
on to the next pub?

842
00:43:20,564 --> 00:43:22,732
We should get in The Beast
and head back to London!

843

- My brake light is broken.
- So don't use the brakes!

- I'm way over the limit.
- When has that ever stopped you?

get pulled over by the police.

C, we've got blood on our hands.

853
00:43:53,064 --> 00:43:55,265

- We've got ink on our hands.

- What?

- Four.

The way I see it, we've told everybody
we were doing The Golden Mile.

862
00:44:19,923 --> 00:44:20,590
You did.

863
00:44:20,591 --> 00:44:22,359
If we suddenly jump in The Beast
now and head for the hills,

864
00:44:22,360 --> 00:44:23,693
they're gonna know that we know,

865
00:44:23,694 --> 00:44:25,929
but if we keep doing what we're
doing and going where we're going,

866
00:44:25,930 --> 00:44:26,996
then they're not gonna know.

867
00:44:26,997 --> 00:44:28,198
- Know what?
- That we know.

868
00:44:28,199 --> 00:44:30,834
I suggest we finish what we started
and leave quietly in the morning.

869
00:44:30,835 --> 00:44:34,278
- Wait. You're really suggesting...
- We finish The Golden Mile.

870
00:44:34,638 --> 00:44:36,909

to give them super strength.

- Hey, why don't we just ask somebody?
- Who?

900
00:47:12,796 --> 00:47:16,205
- The Reverend Green. Come on.
- Wait.

901
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:17,934
What the fuck are you doing?

902
00:47:17,935 --> 00:47:20,471
I'm going to go and have a little
chat with The Reverend Green.

You're going to buy drugs?

904
00:47:22,806 --> 00:47:26,276
I am going to go over there and subtly
check if that is The Reverend Green

905
00:47:26,277 --> 00:47:29,245
and if it is, I can ask him what's going on,

906
00:47:29,246 --> 00:47:30,948
and possibly buy some drugs.

907
00:47:31,048 --> 00:47:32,715
But what if he's one of them?

908
00:47:32,716 --> 00:47:34,918
No, me and The Reverend had
a highly sophisticated code

909
00:47:34,919 --> 00:47:37,039
when discussing the purchase of herbal narcotics.

910
00:47:37,054 --> 00:47:41,464
If he doesn't understand me, it means he's
one of them and I will simply walk away.

911
00:47:41,625 --> 00:47:42,826
Ah!

912
00:47:48,799 --> 00:47:51,634
- Have you got any drugs?
- I don't do that anymore, Gary.

- Do what?
- That.

915
00:47:55,005 --> 00:47:56,839
'Cause drug dealing is not good enough for you?

There are no drug dealers anymore, Gary.

917
00:47:59,009 --> 00:48:00,910

- You had a proper office.
- That was the gents' toilets.

919

Nothing wrong with doing
your business in the toilet.

00:48:05,683 --> 00:48:08,484
- Look, a lot has changed since you have left.
- I know.

- A little.

922
00:48:10,654 --> 00:48:12,055
How much is a little?

- Well, they're not robots.

Course I do. It's like, "Hello, I am a robot."

929
00:48:24,835 --> 00:48:28,471

me, they are not slaves.

Are you guys robots?

941
00:48:52,896 --> 00:48:56,399
Well, the word robot actually
comes from an old Czech word...

942
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:58,034
- <i>...robotnik...</i>
- ...meaning slave.

943
00:48:58,035 --> 00:48:59,902
- And we are not slaves.
- We are very, very happy.

944

00:50:58,188 --> 00:51:02,191
for rogues, reverends, royalty
and all good folks between.

978
00:51:02,192 --> 00:51:03,826
Five of those, please.

979
00:51:03,827 --> 00:51:05,973
Welcome home, boys.

980
00:51:10,167 --> 00:51:12,001
I don't remember him being that friendly.

981
00:51:12,002 --> 00:51:14,504
He's obviously one of them.

982
00:51:14,505 --> 00:51:16,105
- How can he be?
- He remembered me.

983
00:51:16,106 --> 00:51:17,573
We don't know what they remember.

984
00:51:17,574 --> 00:51:19,175
<font color=#FF551>OLIVER:</font>
Maybe they have selective memories.

985
00:51:19,176 --> 00:51:21,077
- Yeah, like what's his name?
- Me.

986
00:51:21,078 --> 00:51:23,012
Maybe he's one of the others. Like The Reverend.

987
00:51:23,013 --> 00:51:24,480
It is very hard to tell, isn't it?

988
00:51:24,481 --> 00:51:26,449
Yeah, I mean, is he one of
them or is he one of them?

989
00:51:26,450 --> 00:51:28,284
Wait, wait, which ones
are the thems again?

990
00:51:28,285 --> 00:51:29,685
Well, they're both thems, aren't they?

991
00:51:29,686 --> 00:51:30,920
But there's two ways of saying it.

992
00:51:30,921 --> 00:51:33,055
Is he one of them or is he one of them?

993
00:51:33,056 --> 00:51:34,357
We need different terms.

994
00:51:34,358 --> 00:51:38,529
One for the people who aren't robots and
one for the robots who aren't robots.

995
00:51:39,530 --> 00:51:44,804
All right, we need to be able to
differentiate between them, them and us.

996
00:51:44,835 --> 00:51:46,636
Yeah, I think the pronouns
are really confusing.

997
00:51:46,637 --> 00:51:48,638
<font color=#FF551>ALL:</font> Yes. I don't even
know what a pronoun is.

998
00:51:48,639 --> 00:51:50,706
It's a word that can
function by itself as a noun

999
00:51:50,707 --> 00:51:52,375
which refers to something else in the discourse.

1000
00:51:52,376 --> 00:51:53,843
- I don't get it.
- You just used one.

1001
00:51:53,844 --> 00:51:55,211
- Did I?
- Yeah. "It" is a pronoun.

1002
00:51:55,212 --> 00:51:56,245
- What is?
- It.

1003
00:51:56,246 --> 00:51:57,313
- Is it?
- Christ.

1004
00:51:57,314 --> 00:52:00,183
Look, we just need a fucking word
so we can identify who's who.

1005
00:52:00,184 --> 00:52:05,163
He's a blank, she's a blank, those
two people are definitely blanks.

1006
00:52:06,890 --> 00:52:08,068
Sam.

1007
00:52:09,026 --> 00:52:10,671
I got this, Steve.

1008
00:52:13,664 --> 00:52:15,309
- All right, Sam?
- Oh, crumbs.

1009
00:52:15,566 --> 00:52:17,366
- How's your night going?
<font color=#ff00ff>- [SIGHS]</font>

1010
00:52:17,367 --> 00:52:19,911
Good. Sort of.

1011
00:52:20,437 --> 00:52:22,639
What do you mean "sort of"?

1012
00:52:23,774 --> 00:52:26,275
Well, it's weird, isn't it?

1013
00:52:26,276 --> 00:52:30,479
You come back and everything's
the same, but sort of different.

1014
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:32,248
Different how?

1015
00:52:32,249 --> 00:52:33,850
Just weird.

1016
00:52:33,851 --> 00:52:35,496
How weird?

1017
00:52:36,153 --> 00:52:37,286
What are you getting at, Gary?

1018
00:52:37,287 --> 00:52:38,966
Come with me.

1019
00:52:41,325 --> 00:52:43,092
Puck's sake, Gary, take a hint.

1020
00:52:43,093 --> 00:52:44,493
It's all right, I'm not trying to have sex with you.

1021
00:52:44,494 --> 00:52:45,962
Why are we in the disabled toilets then?

1022
00:52:45,963 --> 00:52:47,230
There's something I need to tell you right now,

1023
00:52:47,231 --> 00:52:48,531
unless you do want to have sex,

1024
00:52:48,532 --> 00:52:49,632
in which case I'll tell you afterwards.

1025
00:52:49,633 --> 00:52:50,766
Tell me right now.

1026
00:52:50,767 --> 00:52:52,134
Have you noticed anything
creepy about The Twins

1027
00:52:52,135 --> 00:52:53,269
apart from the fact that they're twins?

1028
00:52:53,270 --> 00:52:55,705
Just because they're twins doesn't
automatically make them creepy.

1029
00:52:55,706 --> 00:52:57,440
- It does a little bit.
- You had sex with them.

1030
00:52:57,441 --> 00:53:00,943
A, I did not, and, B, how did you know about that?

1031
00:53:00,944 --> 00:53:03,813
A, it's a small town, B, I'm not
stupid and, C, they told me.

1032
00:53:03,814 --> 00:53:05,648
Right. Well, I did once, but I was wasted,

1033
00:53:05,649 --> 00:53:07,550
which was creepy because it was
like there was four of them.

1034
00:53:07,551 --> 00:53:09,151
I am not proud of it. I am a bit.

1035
00:53:09,152 --> 00:53:11,787
- Is this what you wanted to tell me?
- No, this is...

1037
00:53:15,025 --> 00:53:16,325
Are you okay, Sam? Are you okay, Sam?

1038
00:53:16,326 --> 00:53:18,005
I need a cigarette.

1039
00:53:18,795 --> 00:53:21,330
- Nobots?
- How about Fauxbots?

1040
00:53:21,331 --> 00:53:23,366
I think we should get away
from the whole robots thing.

1041
00:53:23,367 --> 00:53:24,671
Steven?

1042
00:53:24,935 --> 00:53:26,307
What's he up to?

1043
00:53:26,904 --> 00:53:29,672
Oh, don't worry, he's probably just
trying to fuck Oliver's sister.

1044
00:53:29,673 --> 00:53:30,874
Andy.

1045
00:53:32,476 --> 00:53:34,349
Oh, my God, that man is full of shit.

1046
00:53:35,279 --> 00:53:37,046
I know that's not a surprise to you.

1047
00:53:37,047 --> 00:53:39,193
- What did he say, Sam?
- What did he say, Sam?

1048
00:53:39,216 --> 00:53:44,654
He said that Newton Haven has been taken
over by robots full of blue stuff

1049
00:53:44,655 --> 00:53:47,189
and if we don't do what they say,
they will make us their prisoners.

1050
00:53:47,190 --> 00:53:49,028
- Did you believe him?
- Did you believe him?

1051
00:53:49,159 --> 00:53:51,566
No, of course not.

1052
00:53:53,530 --> 00:53:55,573
- Did you believe him?
- Did you believe him?

1053
00:53:56,199 --> 00:53:57,633
What?

- See?
- Come on, Sam.

1058
00:54:12,082 --> 00:54:14,262
You know better than to believe Gary King,

1059
00:54:15,719 --> 00:54:16,920
Oh, crumbs.

1060
00:54:18,255 --> 00:54:19,433
Sam!

<font color=#ff00ff>[MUFFLED]</font> God!

00:54:47,718 --> 00:54:48,919
Oh.

1065
00:54:52,189 --> 00:54:53,990
Gary, what's happening?

1066
00:54:53,991 --> 00:54:56,797
- I told you in the disableds.
- Oh, yes, you did.

1067
00:54:56,827 --> 00:54:58,267
We should get inside, eh?

1068
00:54:58,295 --> 00:55:01,197
Otherwise people are going to
ask what the hell's going on.

1069
00:55:01,198 --> 00:55:02,398
What the hell's going on?

1070
00:55:02,399 --> 00:55:03,799
- Steve, I got this.
- Got what?

1071
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:06,135
Sam, he's not good enough for you.

1072
00:55:06,136 --> 00:55:07,203
- What?
- What?

1073
00:55:07,204 --> 00:55:10,044
We've been through some crazy shit tonight

1074
00:55:10,907 --> 00:55:13,909
and it's really put things in perspective for me,

1075
00:55:13,910 --> 00:55:18,525
and if everything is as fucked up as it seems,
then there's something I need to tell you.

1076
00:55:19,449 --> 00:55:23,352
You might think this is because
I've had seven pints, but it's not.

1077
00:55:23,353 --> 00:55:24,554
It's not.

1078
00:55:25,088 --> 00:55:26,926
I'm in love with you, Sam.

1079
00:55:27,090 --> 00:55:28,792
I always have been,

1080
00:55:28,992 --> 00:55:33,195
and it breaks my heart to see you waste
your affections on Gary fucking King.

1081
00:55:33,196 --> 00:55:35,965
- Hey, that's a bit harsh.
- Oh, no, you've got it all wrong.

1082
00:55:35,966 --> 00:55:38,134
- There's nothing between...
- And while I'm being honest,

1083
00:55:38,135 --> 00:55:42,038
just to lay it all out there, I am
currently seeing a fitness instructor.

1084
00:55:42,039 --> 00:55:43,606
She's 26 years old,

1085
00:55:43,607 --> 00:55:46,375
but I would drop her in a heartbeat if it meant

1086
00:55:46,376 --> 00:55:48,210
that I had one last chance with you.

1087
00:55:48,211 --> 00:55:51,585
Steven, there's nothing
between me and Gary King.

Hey! Get your feet off her!

1094
00:56:29,486 --> 00:56:32,166
Pop its head off! Pop its head
off like an aspirin bottle.

Nothing suggested in the last three minutes

1098
00:56:42,432 --> 00:56:44,200
has been better than Smashy-Smashy Egg Men.

1099
00:56:44,201 --> 00:56:45,868
- Nothing.
- What the hell's going on?

1100
00:56:45,869 --> 00:56:48,204
Did you guys think of a name for
the robots who aren't robots?

1101
00:56:48,205 --> 00:56:50,639
I'm afraid we've drawn a blank.

1102
00:56:50,640 --> 00:56:53,442
Well, we just had a barney with
two blanks in the beer garden.

<font color=#FF551>- SAM:</font> We have to leave now!
<font color=#FF551>- GARY:</font> Agreed.

1104
00:56:59,249 --> 00:57:00,549
Let's hit The Mermaid.

1105
00:57:00,550 --> 00:57:02,318
- Wait, what?
- Number eight.

1106
00:57:02,319 --> 00:57:03,352
"Number eight"?

1107
00:57:03,353 --> 00:57:05,829
- Oh, fuck.
- Andy, what's happening?

1108
00:57:06,123 --> 00:57:09,558
Gary thinks we should keep on with the
crawl because they know what we're doing,

1109
00:57:09,559 --> 00:57:11,694
but they don't know that we
know what they're doing.

1110
00:57:11,695 --> 00:57:15,172
And basically no one else
has a better idea, so fuck it.

1111
00:57:16,666 --> 00:57:18,004
What?

1112
00:57:18,969 --> 00:57:20,147
Wait!

1113
00:57:24,241 --> 00:57:26,709
<font color=#FF551>SAM:</font> Guys! Guys!
I've got a better idea.

1114
00:57:26,710 --> 00:57:28,744
I'm parked right round here somewhere.

1115
00:57:28,745 --> 00:57:31,547
Haul it. Just go! Steven, tell them!

1116
00:57:31,548 --> 00:57:33,616
Gary said they'll get us
if we try and leave now.

1117
00:57:33,617 --> 00:57:36,857
We're way past leaving now. Come on.

1118

1119
00:57:49,933 --> 00:57:51,669
<font color=#ff00ff>[LAUGHS]</font> Oh, yeah.

1120
00:57:52,235 --> 00:57:54,170
This is what the kids want.

1121
00:57:54,171 --> 00:57:55,604
This is a bit mad, isn't it?

1122
00:57:55,605 --> 00:57:58,574
This is perfect. We can hide out in here.
I'll get the drinks in.

1123
00:57:58,575 --> 00:58:00,075
- Good plan, O-Man.
- Hey!

1124
00:58:00,076 --> 00:58:01,846
Keep an eye out for blanks.

1125
00:58:01,912 --> 00:58:03,113
You've got it.

1126
00:58:14,224 --> 00:58:17,326
- Why didn't you say anything?
- About what?

1127
00:58:17,327 --> 00:58:19,370
About what you said in the garden.

1128
00:58:20,564 --> 00:58:21,830
I always wanted to.

1129
00:58:21,831 --> 00:58:23,832
It just never seemed like the right moment.

1130
00:58:23,833 --> 00:58:25,801
Something always got in the way.

1131
00:58:25,802 --> 00:58:28,039
Here you go, get these down you.

1132
00:58:28,438 --> 00:58:29,605
Thanks.

1133
00:58:29,606 --> 00:58:32,013
Steven?

1134
00:58:36,479 --> 00:58:39,648
Please! I have so much to live for!

1135
00:58:39,649 --> 00:58:41,717
- It's me, you numpty.
- Basil!

1136
00:58:41,718 --> 00:58:44,653
I knew seeing your faces again would spell trouble.

1137
00:58:44,654 --> 00:58:47,223
Wait. How do I know it's really you?

1138
00:58:47,224 --> 00:58:52,169
Because I'm the only one who's going to
tell you the truth about Newton Haven.

1139
00:58:52,796 --> 00:58:57,066
Now, do you recall the events of
the evening of June the 22nd, 1990?

1140
00:58:57,067 --> 00:58:59,269
No, but I know a man who does.

1141
00:59:02,439 --> 00:59:04,240
- Here you go.
- Hey.

1142
00:59:04,241 --> 00:59:06,421
See anyone we know?

1143
00:59:12,015 --> 00:59:14,286
- The Marmalade Sandwich.
- The Marmalade Sandwich.

1144
00:59:20,624 --> 00:59:21,996
They look good.

1145
00:59:24,527 --> 00:59:27,105
- It's the lights.
- It's the drink.

1146
00:59:30,934 --> 00:59:32,670
Who cares what it is?

1147
00:59:34,271 --> 00:59:35,643
<font color=#FF551>SAM:</font> Steven?

1148
00:59:36,840 --> 00:59:38,041
Steven?

1149
00:59:39,009 --> 00:59:40,509
That was the night they arrived.

1150
00:59:40,510 --> 00:59:42,745
Remember the shooting star? That was them.

1151
00:59:42,746 --> 00:59:44,213
Nothing happened at first.

1152
00:59:44,214 --> 00:59:47,950
They were getting ready, burrowing
in underground, preparing.

1153
00:59:47,951 --> 00:59:51,086
<i>Not long after you lot left,
people started to change.</i>

1154
00:59:51,087 --> 00:59:53,122
<i>Just one or two at first, then more.</i>

1155
00:59:53,123 --> 00:59:56,736
They replaced people of influence,
taking over the institutions,

1156
00:59:56,793 --> 01:00:00,129
<i>remaking, remodeling, refurbishing.</i>

1157
01:00:00,130 --> 01:00:02,250
Doing everything they could
to make us join them.

1158
01:00:02,599 --> 01:00:04,608
<font color=#ff00ff>[LOUD MUSIC PLAYING]</font>

1159
01:00:09,706 --> 01:00:13,877
I can't find Steven. Where are the others?

1160
01:00:14,511 --> 01:00:15,917
They're blending in.

1161
01:00:18,882 --> 01:00:20,459
Oh, crumbs.

1162
01:00:20,483 --> 01:00:23,552
It's not like the replacements were evil, far from it.

1163
01:00:23,553 --> 01:00:27,394
People got a lot friendlier. That's how they do it,

1164
01:00:27,924 --> 01:00:30,759
<i>It's not an invasion, it's a merger.</i>

1165
01:00:30,760 --> 01:00:33,941
<i>They don't want to get rid of
us, not if they can help it.</i>

1166
01:00:34,064 --> 01:00:36,832
<i>They just want to make us more like them.</i>

1167
01:00:36,833 --> 01:00:38,734
<i>Change the way we think.</i>

1168
01:00:38,735 --> 01:00:40,903
<i>Bring us into line with all the others.</i>

1169
01:00:40,904 --> 01:00:43,106
<i>Become another link in their chain.</i>

1170
01:00:43,373 --> 01:00:45,951
<i>Which is fine, unless you say no.</i>

1171
01:00:46,910 --> 01:00:48,610
That's when you get replaced.

1172
01:00:48,611 --> 01:00:50,913
Once they get your DNA, they've got you.

1173
01:00:50,914 --> 01:00:52,081
How do they do that?

1174
01:00:52,082 --> 01:00:53,415
<font color=#FF551>BASIL:</font> <i>Any way they like.</i>

1175
01:00:53,416 --> 01:00:59,464
<i>Blood tests, the nit nurse, sweat,
kissing, saliva on the rim of a glass.</i>

1176
01:00:59,889 --> 01:01:02,558
Why do you think I drink with this crazy straw?

1177
01:01:02,559 --> 01:01:04,136
Not so crazy now, is it?

1178
01:01:04,194 --> 01:01:07,375
If you're not on their side,
they'll create a version that is.

1179
01:01:07,597 --> 01:01:11,677
<i>They can bring you back exactly the
same or even make you young again.</i>

1180
01:01:11,968 --> 01:01:13,902
<i>It looks like you, it
even has your memories,</i>

1181
01:01:13,903 --> 01:01:16,438
<i>but really it's just a vessel
to spread their message.</i>

1182
01:01:16,439 --> 01:01:20,809
<i>Trust, love, respect, desire.</i>

1183
01:01:20,810 --> 01:01:23,752
<i>Replaced in the name of progress.</i>

1184
01:01:24,814 --> 01:01:27,316
So, what happens to the
people who get replaced?

1185
01:01:27,317 --> 01:01:30,386
The empties? Don't ask
me what happens to them.

1186
01:01:30,387 --> 01:01:31,754
Why, what happens to the empties?

1187
01:01:31,755 --> 01:01:33,455
I told you not to ask me that!

1188
01:01:33,456 --> 01:01:35,932
Go! Get out, before it's too late!

1189
01:01:39,829 --> 01:01:42,031
- Basil?
- I said go!

1190
01:01:45,869 --> 01:01:47,514
This just can't be good.

1191
01:01:47,637 --> 01:01:50,750
Sam, who was the boy that you
liked in sixth form? Adrian?

1192
01:01:51,374 --> 01:01:54,054
Adrian Keane. Why?

1193
01:01:54,477 --> 01:01:55,883
He's over there.

1194
01:02:04,721 --> 01:02:07,561
Hey, Sam. How's life?

1195
01:02:11,728 --> 01:02:13,829
Sam, we have to get out of here!
We have to get out of here!

1196
01:02:13,830 --> 01:02:16,203
- Where are the others?
- They're blending in.

1197
01:02:17,801 --> 01:02:19,639
Oh, fuck!

1198
01:02:21,838 --> 01:02:23,881
Gary! No, just one more song.

1199
01:02:24,073 --> 01:02:26,074
Gary, she's a blank!

1200
01:02:26,075 --> 01:02:27,509
Don't be so judgmental.

1201

Oh, for fuck...

1202
01:02:30,880 --> 01:02:32,080
Oh, yeah. Come on.

1203
01:02:32,081 --> 01:02:33,692
- Still got it.
- Enough's enough.

1204
01:02:33,750 --> 01:02:34,883
Let's go.

- Prick.

1209
01:02:42,725 --> 01:02:44,226
I thought you liked Adrian Keane.

1210
01:02:44,227 --> 01:02:45,928
- Adrian Keane is dead.
- Oh, God.

1211
01:02:45,929 --> 01:02:48,997
Adrian Keane died in a motorbike
accident in Italy eight years ago.

1212
01:02:48,998 --> 01:02:50,866
- Did he?
- They must have had his DNA on file.

1213
01:02:50,867 --> 01:02:52,401
That's how they were able to replicate him.

1214
01:02:52,402 --> 01:02:54,670
They know how to get to us, man.
They know everything.

1215
01:02:54,671 --> 01:02:57,239
- They didn't know Adrian was dead.
- They knew enough to tempt us.

1216
01:02:57,240 --> 01:02:59,775
They knew these three would fall for
a bunch of girls in school uniform.

1217
01:02:59,776 --> 01:03:03,278
- Hey, who wouldn't? Am I right?

Another good name for the band, Steve.

1223
01:03:13,009 --> 01:03:15,224
You're putting our lives in
the hands of a crazy old man?

1224
01:03:15,225 --> 01:03:16,959
- He's not crazy!
- No, maybe he's not.

1225
01:03:16,960 --> 01:03:18,894
Or maybe he's a blank trying to
lure us to the edge of town,

1226
01:03:18,895 --> 01:03:21,396
onto those dark country roads
where they can deal with us.

1227
01:03:21,397 --> 01:03:24,766
Yeah, we could end up dead in a field.
I hate fields.

commission by this point in the evening.

Does anyone know what robot means?

- Yeah. I do!
- Yes, Gary.

1258
01:04:55,558 --> 01:04:57,125
It means "slave."

1259
01:04:57,126 --> 01:04:59,306
Oh, very good, Gary.

1260
01:04:59,596 --> 01:05:01,129
Are you a robot, sir?

1261
01:05:01,130 --> 01:05:04,166
No, Peter, of course I'm not a robot.

1262

- Sir?
- Yes, Steven.

1263
01:05:05,268 --> 01:05:06,668
But you're on their side, though?

1264
01:05:06,669 --> 01:05:09,571
This is not about sides, Steven.

1265
01:05:09,572 --> 01:05:11,840
It's not about shirts versus skins.

1266
01:05:11,841 --> 01:05:15,644
It's about working together as one team.

1267
01:05:15,645 --> 01:05:19,383
I know it may seem a bit weird
and a little bit scary, but...

01:05:22,118 --> 01:05:23,752
They're here to help.

1270
01:05:23,753 --> 01:05:27,400
To straighten us out. To
prepare us for the big league.

1271
01:05:27,557 --> 01:05:30,993
They've seen something in us, a potential.

1272
01:05:30,994 --> 01:05:33,695
There's a vast community of worlds up there,

1273

living together, peacefully, cooperatively.

1274
01:05:38,401 --> 01:05:41,605

us along for the ride.

And what one amongst you

In some respects, they're a lot like teachers.

Oh, oh!

1302
01:07:47,563 --> 01:07:49,640
- Oh, crumbs, you're heavy.
- Sorry.

1303

Twist the melon, man!

1307
01:08:41,150 --> 01:08:42,761
Yeah!
<font color=#ff00ff>[GRUNTS]</font>

1308
01:08:44,654 --> 01:08:48,597
Sam, this is no way for a family to behave.

1309
01:08:57,166 --> 01:08:59,812
Sam, I'm disappointed in you.

1310
01:09:06,042 --> 01:09:08,244
O-Man!

1311
01:09:12,215 --> 01:09:13,758
<font color=#ff00ff>[GRUNTING]</font>

1312
01:09:22,758 --> 01:09:23,959
Okay, Andy.

1313
01:09:24,126 --> 01:09:25,634
Break it up.

1314
01:09:27,129 --> 01:09:28,967
It doesn't have to be like this.

1315
01:09:29,966 --> 01:09:36,208
It could be so much simpler,
so completely painless.

1316
01:09:36,873 --> 01:09:39,040
If only you'd see the light.

1317
01:09:39,041 --> 01:09:40,275
<font color=#FF551>OLIVER:</font> Yes.

1318
01:09:40,276 --> 01:09:44,083
See, it's not about conflict,

1319
01:09:45,848 --> 01:09:47,649
it's about togetherness.

1320
01:09:47,650 --> 01:09:50,956
- Yes.
- Let's try this again, shall we?

1321
01:09:51,354 --> 01:09:52,555
How about another round?

1322
01:09:52,922 --> 01:09:57,002
Nah, we're done here.

1323
01:09:57,593 --> 01:10:01,229
- Yes, Gary, that appears to be the case.

Oh, look, there's my car!

1336
01:10:48,044 --> 01:10:49,484
Let's climb down the drainpipe.

1337

I've got a better idea.

<font color=#ff00ff>[CAR ALARM WAILING]</font>

1339
01:10:55,484 --> 01:10:57,163
Climb down the drainpipe.

1340
01:11:00,790 --> 01:11:01,990
Okay, just go.

1341
01:11:01,991 --> 01:11:03,024
Wait. What about the others?

1342
01:11:03,025 --> 01:11:04,592
- Leave 'em with me, okay?
- I got this.

1343
01:11:04,593 --> 01:11:06,704
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, I always land on my feet.

1344
01:11:07,029 --> 01:11:08,550
I don't know if that's true, Gary.

1345
01:11:08,864 --> 01:11:10,065
Just go.

1346
01:11:10,433 --> 01:11:12,400
Will you find out what
happened to my brother?

1347
01:11:12,401 --> 01:11:16,105
Yeah, of course, of course, and
I'll look after Stevie for you, eh?

1348
01:11:16,572 --> 01:11:19,446
He's a good guy. He's better than me.

1349
01:11:19,976 --> 01:11:24,214
Gary, you're not a bad person, but
you're not boyfriend material.

1350
01:11:24,480 --> 01:11:27,282
The whole "free spirit quick one
in the disabled toilets" thing

1351
01:11:27,283 --> 01:11:31,260
is kinda cool when you're 17,
but not when you're facing 40.

1352
01:11:32,088 --> 01:11:35,735
There comes a time when you have
to go forwards and not backwards.

1353
01:11:36,559 --> 01:11:39,759
Maybe if I hadn't left you behind that
night, things would all be different.

1354
01:11:40,396 --> 01:11:42,200
It's not all about that night, Gary.

1355
01:11:42,965 --> 01:11:44,166
Isn't it?

1356
01:11:44,600 --> 01:11:46,074
It doesn't have to be.

1357
01:11:48,204 --> 01:11:50,364
We'll always have the
disableds, though, won't we?

1358
01:11:51,073 --> 01:11:53,844
Yeah. Yeah, we'll always have the disableds.

01:12:32,081 --> 01:12:33,248
You did what?

1365
01:12:33,249 --> 01:12:35,316
I put her in her car. I just told her to leave.

1366
01:12:35,317 --> 01:12:38,119
You just sent away the only one
of us sober enough to drive?

1367
01:12:38,120 --> 01:12:40,455
- Yeah.
- You just couldn't stand the fact

1368
01:12:40,456 --> 01:12:41,923
that she might prefer me to you.

1369
01:12:41,924 --> 01:12:43,797
- That's not true.
- It is true, Gary!

1370
01:12:43,926 --> 01:12:45,833
I was getting somewhere. We held hands.

1371
01:12:45,895 --> 01:12:48,463
- I was just trying to help!
- You were trying to help yourself, more like!

1372
01:12:48,464 --> 01:12:51,433
Jesus, I do something right for a
change and you fuckers get on my case.

1373
01:12:51,434 --> 01:12:54,869
Wow, that's the first time I've
ever heard you admit being wrong.

1374
01:12:54,870 --> 01:12:56,604
I said I did something right!

1375
01:12:56,605 --> 01:12:57,872
Yeah, "for a change".

1376
01:12:57,873 --> 01:13:00,075
<font color=#FF551>- GARY:</font> So?
- Meaning the rest of the time you're wrong.

1377
01:13:00,076 --> 01:13:01,743
Not necessarily.

1378
01:13:01,744 --> 01:13:05,080
Look, I just thought it was best
to keep her out of harm's way.

1379
01:13:05,081 --> 01:13:07,449
And what about us, Gary?
Aren't we in harm's way?

1380
01:13:07,450 --> 01:13:10,151
We're all right, Pete. Come on,
we're The Five Musketeers.

1381
01:13:10,152 --> 01:13:12,423
No, we're the Four Musketeers.

1382
01:13:14,390 --> 01:13:18,037
Wait, how do we know
you put her in the car?

1383
01:13:18,594 --> 01:13:20,161
How do we know you're you?

1384
01:13:20,162 --> 01:13:21,362
Of course I'm me!

1385
01:13:21,363 --> 01:13:24,874
- Well, who the fuck are you, Gary?
- I'm Gary King.

1386
01:13:25,201 --> 01:13:27,802
There's only one Gary King. How
do I know you guys are you?

1387
01:13:27,803 --> 01:13:29,414
We've been together the whole time.

1388
01:13:29,438 --> 01:13:32,707
You might all not be you. How did
you know O-Man wasn't O-Man?

1389
01:13:32,708 --> 01:13:34,709
Because his birthmark was back.

1390
01:13:34,710 --> 01:13:37,045
<font color=#FF551>- GARY:</font> What does that prove?
- Because of what Basil said.

1391
01:13:37,046 --> 01:13:38,680
They make a copy from your DNA.

1392
01:13:38,681 --> 01:13:40,048
That's why he had his birthmark.

1393
01:13:40,049 --> 01:13:41,516
He was new, like a baby.

1394
01:13:41,517 --> 01:13:43,485
- Like a man-baby.
- Like a "maybe".

1395
01:13:43,486 --> 01:13:45,887
Oliver with none of the shit that
had happened to the real Oliver.

1396
01:13:45,888 --> 01:13:47,922
<font color=#FF551>ANDY:</font> The laser surgery!

1397
01:13:47,923 --> 01:13:49,568
So the blanks really are just blank?

1398

No wear and tear, no scars.

1399
01:13:53,095 --> 01:13:55,630
Steven, in 1987 we were playing
cricket and I accidentally pushed you

1400
01:13:55,631 --> 01:13:57,832
onto a broken bottle that
nearly went up your ass.

1401
01:13:57,833 --> 01:13:59,307
- So?
- Show us your bum.

1402
01:14:05,040 --> 01:14:06,574
- Very nice.
- Thank you.

1403
01:14:06,575 --> 01:14:09,244
Pete, you got that 50cc Suzuki in 1988,

1404
01:14:09,245 --> 01:14:11,606
and you let me have a go on it
and I ran over your leg.

1405
01:14:13,516 --> 01:14:14,782
What the fuck?

1406
01:14:14,783 --> 01:14:17,122
Oh, wait, it's the other one.

<font color=#ff00ff>[CHUCKLES]</font>

1408
01:14:19,455 --> 01:14:22,757
Andy, in 1986 we re-enacted
the Knife Game from <i>Aliens</i>

1409
01:14:22,758 --> 01:14:24,192
and I stabbed you in the middle finger.

1410
01:14:24,193 --> 01:14:27,896
How about December 1997, when you OD'd

1411
01:14:27,897 --> 01:14:30,832
and I drove you to the hospital
four times over the limit

1412
01:14:30,833 --> 01:14:34,836
and I ended up rolling the car and
almost severing my femoral artery,

1413
01:14:34,837 --> 01:14:37,639
at which point you made
a miraculous fucking recovery

1414
01:14:37,640 --> 01:14:40,909
and ran off into the night,
leaving me to get arrested

1415
01:14:40,910 --> 01:14:43,147
after 12 hours of life-saving surgery?

1416
01:14:43,546 --> 01:14:44,952
Either one of those will do.

1417
01:14:47,349 --> 01:14:49,450
- Thank you.
- What about you?

1418
01:14:49,451 --> 01:14:50,994
That's easy.

1419
01:14:52,488 --> 01:14:55,156
That could have been drawn on.
Aren't all tattoos drawn on?

1420
01:14:55,157 --> 01:14:57,633
- Yeah.
<font color=#FF551>- ANDY:</font> Show us your arm.

1421
01:14:58,027 --> 01:15:01,003
- What?
- Show us your arm.

1422
01:15:01,864 --> 01:15:03,064
No, no.

1423
01:15:03,065 --> 01:15:07,869
You fell off stage at the fifth-year ball
fucking around and dislocated your elbow.

1424
01:15:07,870 --> 01:15:10,104
You've got a scar where they
put the metal plate in.

1425
01:15:10,105 --> 01:15:12,006
I don't have to show you anything, all right?

1426
01:15:12,007 --> 01:15:14,375
I'm Gary King. I know I'm me.

1427
01:15:14,376 --> 01:15:17,412
If I'm not me, then how do I know that
carved into that beam above your head

1428
01:15:17,413 --> 01:15:19,447
are the words "King Gary"?

1429
01:15:19,448 --> 01:15:20,648
But it doesn't say "King Gary".

1430
01:15:20,649 --> 01:15:23,318
Yes, it does. Doesn't it?

1431
01:15:23,319 --> 01:15:26,120
No. It says "King Gay".

1432
01:15:26,121 --> 01:15:29,157
Some cunt scrubbed out the "R"!

1433
01:15:29,158 --> 01:15:30,592
- That was me.
<font color=#FF551>- GARY:</font> Why?

1434
01:15:30,593 --> 01:15:33,228
- "King Gay". <font color=#ff00ff>[LAUGHS]</font>
- That means fuck-all anyway.

1435
01:15:33,229 --> 01:15:35,568
Mr. Shepherd remembered stuff, so did Oliver.

1436
01:15:35,631 --> 01:15:37,868
Selective memory, remember?

1437
01:15:39,768 --> 01:15:43,848
We don't see you for years and you
just pitch up and bring us here.

1438
01:15:44,206 --> 01:15:46,846
You better come out with some
hard evidence that you're human,

1439
01:15:47,276 --> 01:15:49,752
otherwise we're going to
find out for ourselves.

1440
01:15:50,913 --> 01:15:53,252
You want evidence?

1441
01:15:54,516 --> 01:15:55,888
There!

1442
01:16:00,456 --> 01:16:01,689
That proves I'm human!

1443
01:16:01,690 --> 01:16:02,757
It proves you're stupid.

1444
01:16:02,758 --> 01:16:04,092
Exactly!

1445
01:16:04,093 --> 01:16:05,693

Peter.

1459
01:16:38,394 --> 01:16:42,041
I thought that was you. Are you okay?

Am I what?

1461
01:16:44,400 --> 01:16:47,068
I know we didn't see eye to eye at school.

1462
01:16:47,069 --> 01:16:49,476
Goodness knows I regret that.

1463
01:16:49,872 --> 01:16:51,606
I wanted to say something back at the pub,

1464
01:16:51,607 --> 01:16:54,754
but I felt so terribly ashamed by what I'd done.

1465
01:16:55,144 --> 01:16:59,053
Let me make it up to you, Peter. Please.

1466
01:17:02,151 --> 01:17:04,319
- Gary, you're out of your mind!
- We've come too far.

1467
01:17:04,320 --> 01:17:05,386
It's fucking suicide.

1468
01:17:05,387 --> 01:17:09,223
I know. We are going to get to
The World's End if it kills us.

1469
01:17:09,224 --> 01:17:11,025
Where's Pete?

1470
01:17:11,026 --> 01:17:12,960
<font color=#FF551>PETER:</font> I hate you!

1471
01:17:12,961 --> 01:17:15,801
You fucking bastard! I hate you!

1472
01:17:15,864 --> 01:17:19,033
- Pete! Leave it!
- Why are you doing this, Peter?

1473
01:17:19,034 --> 01:17:20,372
We don't want to hurt you.

1474
01:17:21,236 --> 01:17:23,109
- Come on, mate!
- It's not worth it!

1475
01:17:23,439 --> 01:17:25,448
Yes, it fucking is!

1476
01:17:25,607 --> 01:17:26,808
<font color=#ff00ff>[SCREAMS]</font>

1477
01:17:26,809 --> 01:17:27,987
What's he doing?

1478
01:17:28,477 --> 01:17:29,815
Oh, shit.

1479
01:17:30,512 --> 01:17:31,713
Peter...

1480
01:17:33,615 --> 01:17:34,793
Peter...

1481
01:17:35,651 --> 01:17:40,129
I must say, I'm very disappointed in you, Peter.

1482
01:17:44,226 --> 01:17:46,327
I'll punch their fucking lights out.

1483
01:17:46,328 --> 01:17:48,208
Andy! No, no, no, there's too many of them.

1484
01:17:55,637 --> 01:17:56,838
Pete.

1485
01:18:08,350 --> 01:18:09,450
Peter.

1486
01:18:09,451 --> 01:18:10,952
- We gotta go.
- Gary's right.

1487
01:18:10,953 --> 01:18:12,787
- We gotta get to The King's Head.
- Exactly.

1488
01:18:12,788 --> 01:18:14,126
- What?
<font color=#ff00ff>- [GRUNTS]</font>

1489
01:18:15,157 --> 01:18:17,959
We are not going to The King's Head.
We're done.

1490
01:18:17,960 --> 01:18:19,927
We're going to do what we should
have done in the first place.

1491
01:18:19,928 --> 01:18:21,449
Get The Beast and get out of here.

1492
01:18:21,530 --> 01:18:24,677
We are fucking leaving
and we are never coming back.

1493
01:18:25,601 --> 01:18:27,435
Now, you can either come with us willingly

1494
01:18:27,436 --> 01:18:30,438
or I'm gonna knock you the fuck
out and carry you there myself.

1495
01:18:30,439 --> 01:18:32,507
- You choose.
- All right. All right.

1496
01:18:32,508 --> 01:18:36,244
Just think about what you're saying, you
know, because you have been drinking.

1497
01:18:36,245 --> 01:18:37,446
You fuck.

1498
01:18:54,930 --> 01:18:56,831
<font color=#FF551>STEVEN:</font>
Shit, it's those fucking kids.

1499
01:18:56,832 --> 01:18:58,534
Not them again.

1500
01:19:03,172 --> 01:19:05,206
What the hell is that?

1501
01:19:05,207 --> 01:19:07,887
I don't know, but it's definitely not modern art.

1502
01:19:17,519 --> 01:19:20,588
Oh, shit, we're trapped. Where's The Beast?

1503
01:19:20,589 --> 01:19:25,026
Okay, all right. We're here, so
The Beast is in the next street.

1504
01:19:25,027 --> 01:19:26,194
How are we gonna get to it?

1505
01:19:26,195 --> 01:19:28,196
- We'll have to go through.
- Through where?

1506
01:19:28,197 --> 01:19:30,274
I don't fucking believe this.

1507
01:19:31,767 --> 01:19:33,275
Number 10.

1508
01:19:36,872 --> 01:19:38,073
Come on.

1509
01:19:39,708 --> 01:19:40,909
<font color=#ff00ff>[GRUNTS]</font>

1510
01:19:41,176 --> 01:19:42,354
Let's go.

1511
01:19:42,711 --> 01:19:44,822
The backdoor, back door.
Let's go.

1512
01:19:45,547 --> 01:19:46,748
Here we go.

1513
01:19:49,718 --> 01:19:50,919
Okay, there it is.

1514
01:19:51,520 --> 01:19:52,721
Shit.

1515
01:19:54,389 --> 01:19:56,924
We wait for an opening, and
then we leg it to The Beast.

1516
01:19:56,925 --> 01:19:58,729
We need the keys.

1517
01:20:01,029 --> 01:20:02,435
<font color=#FF551>ANDY:</font> Gary?

1518
01:20:04,566 --> 01:20:06,973
Gary, what are you doing?

1519
01:20:07,836 --> 01:20:09,570
Just a little toast.

1520
01:20:09,571 --> 01:20:12,573
Gary, put the pint down, yeah?

1521
01:20:12,574 --> 01:20:15,812
To Oliver, Pete.

1522
01:20:16,812 --> 01:20:17,990
And to us.

1523
01:20:18,547 --> 01:20:20,784
You know, 'cause 10 pubs isn't bad,

1524
01:20:21,316 --> 01:20:24,963
It's not, but we're calling time.

1525
01:20:26,755 --> 01:20:27,956
Okay.

1526

<font color=#ff00ff>[SIGHS]</font>

1527
01:20:44,840 --> 01:20:46,314

1528
01:20:48,110 --> 01:20:49,345
Number 10.

1529
01:20:51,113 --> 01:20:52,314
Okay.

1530
01:20:52,814 --> 01:20:54,288
So close.

1531
01:20:59,488 --> 01:21:02,897
No, no, no, no, no. Gary!

1532
01:21:04,192 --> 01:21:05,793
Gary! Gary!

1533
01:21:05,794 --> 01:21:08,406
Let him go. He left you, man.

1534
01:21:08,931 --> 01:21:10,166
I can't.

1535
01:21:10,799 --> 01:21:12,000
Andy!

1536
01:21:22,711 --> 01:21:25,050
Gary! Gary!

1537
01:21:28,083 --> 01:21:31,025
Gary, come back! Come
back, you stupid bastard!

1538
01:21:54,876 --> 01:21:56,316
Gary!

1539
01:21:56,845 --> 01:21:59,355
Gary! Gary!

<font color=#ff00ff>[GRUNTING]</font>

1543
01:22:41,456 --> 01:22:42,634

<font color=#FF551>STEVEN:</font> Get in. Get in.

1546
01:22:51,533 --> 01:22:54,111
Gary, Andy, get the fuck in!

1547
01:22:54,269 --> 01:22:57,204
You heard him, Andy. Get the fuck in.

1548
01:22:57,205 --> 01:22:59,214
We haven't much time!

1549
01:23:10,452 --> 01:23:13,223
- Andy! Go, now!
- Steven!

1550
01:23:14,089 --> 01:23:15,427
Go!

<font color=#ff00ff>[GRUNTS]</font>

1552
01:23:35,210 --> 01:23:36,388
Andy.

1553
01:23:38,046 --> 01:23:39,850
I want you inside me.

1554
01:23:40,749 --> 01:23:41,950
Okay.

1555
01:23:47,189 --> 01:23:48,390

Ah!

01:24:10,445 --> 01:24:13,013
- You've had enough!
- This is The World's End, man!

1560
01:24:13,014 --> 01:24:14,318
I know!

1561
01:24:14,883 --> 01:24:16,084
Stop this!

1562
01:24:17,586 --> 01:24:20,254
Leave me alone! What do you care anyway?

1563
01:24:20,255 --> 01:24:23,891
Of course I fucking care.
There's a reason I'm angry at you!

1564
01:24:23,892 --> 01:24:25,926
I know why you're angry at me, okay?

1565
01:24:25,927 --> 01:24:28,529
But it's not my fault that you crashed that car.

1566
01:24:28,530 --> 01:24:31,711
That's not the point.
You let me down, man.

1567
01:24:31,833 --> 01:24:34,877
You were Gary King. Gary fucking King.

1568
01:24:35,504 --> 01:24:39,373
I would have followed you to the end.
<font color=#ff00ff>[CHUCKLES]</font> I fucking have!

1569
01:24:39,374 --> 01:24:41,747
Then stop following me!
<font color=#ff00ff>[GRUNTS]</font>

1570
01:24:46,515 --> 01:24:49,491
No! It's just one more.

1571
01:24:49,985 --> 01:24:51,994
Let me have this.

1572
01:24:53,054 --> 01:24:54,855
You've got everything you want.

1573
01:24:54,856 --> 01:24:56,290
What are you talking about?

1574
01:24:56,291 --> 01:25:00,194
You've got your perfect job and your
perfect house and your perfect wife.

1575
01:25:00,195 --> 01:25:01,806
You think it's so perfect?

1576
01:25:04,399 --> 01:25:05,942
She left me, Gary.

1577
01:25:06,334 --> 01:25:08,602
She took the kids to her
mum's three weeks ago,

1578
01:25:08,603 --> 01:25:12,039
Said I'm not present enough.
I'm trying to win her back.

1579
01:25:12,040 --> 01:25:13,674
And God knows I am losing.

1580
01:25:13,675 --> 01:25:17,914
But I will continue to fight,
because that is how we survive.

1581
01:25:18,914 --> 01:25:22,983
For fuck's sake, Gary, I just punched
my wedding ring out of a robot's tummy.

1582
01:25:22,984 --> 01:25:25,186
Exactly! You fight for what's important.

1583
01:25:25,187 --> 01:25:27,254
But what is so important
about The Golden Mile?

1584
01:25:27,255 --> 01:25:28,957
It's all I've got!

1585
01:25:29,524 --> 01:25:30,828

1588
01:25:52,113 --> 01:25:53,485
You need help, Gary.

1589
01:25:53,548 --> 01:25:57,195
I got help. You know what help was?

1590
01:25:58,119 --> 01:26:00,187
Help was a lot of people sitting in a circle

1591
01:26:00,188 --> 01:26:02,334
talking about how fucking awful things had got.

1592
01:26:02,757 --> 01:26:05,125
That is not my idea of a good time.

1593
01:26:05,126 --> 01:26:08,398
- And this is?
- They told me when to go to bed.

1594
01:26:09,431 --> 01:26:10,632
Me!

1595
01:26:11,233 --> 01:26:16,704
Gary, mate, how can you tell when
you're drunk if you're never sober?

1596
01:26:16,705 --> 01:26:18,816
I don't wanna be sober.

1597
01:26:20,041 --> 01:26:22,812
It never got better than that night.

1598
01:26:23,211 --> 01:26:25,331
That was supposed to be
the beginning of my life.

1599
01:26:25,914 --> 01:26:28,993
All that promise and fucking optimism.

1600
01:26:29,117 --> 01:26:32,764
That feeling like we could
take on the whole universe.

1601
01:26:33,255 --> 01:26:34,991
It was a big lie.

1602
01:26:36,591 --> 01:26:38,726
Nothing happened.

1603
01:26:38,727 --> 01:26:40,600
You don't need to do this, Gary.

1604
01:26:43,598 --> 01:26:45,004
Yeah, I do.

What are you doing?

1611
01:27:50,565 --> 01:27:52,366
No, don't go out there.

<i>Gary King of the humans.</i>

1615
01:28:03,445 --> 01:28:05,454
Yeah. What do you want?

1616
01:28:05,613 --> 01:28:09,149
<i>We are here to enable your full potential,</i>

1617
01:28:09,150 --> 01:28:12,586
<i>as we have with countless
worlds across the galaxy.</i>

1618
01:28:12,587 --> 01:28:15,289
Oh, yeah? How'd you manage that, then?

1619
01:28:15,290 --> 01:28:17,791
We appropriate a small
percentage of the population

1620
01:28:17,792 --> 01:28:21,303
at 2,000 or so penetration
points across the planet.

1621
01:28:21,396 --> 01:28:24,406
This ensures maximum coverage.

1622
01:28:24,766 --> 01:28:30,237
From there, we create simulants
to spread our ideologies

1623
01:28:30,238 --> 01:28:32,111
through peaceful indoctrination.

1624
01:28:32,574 --> 01:28:36,310
Our objective is simple, to ready the population

1625
01:28:36,311 --> 01:28:39,117
for participation in our galactic community.

1626
01:28:39,647 --> 01:28:43,650
This method requires a small sacrifice.

1627
01:28:43,651 --> 01:28:46,053
But the fewer replacements we make,

1628
01:28:46,054 --> 01:28:48,355
the more successful we consider our operation.

1629
01:28:48,356 --> 01:28:53,130
Of course, we welcome those
who volunteer themselves.

1630
01:28:53,194 --> 01:28:58,173
We can offer attractive incentives
for those who willingly combine.

1794
01:39:27,361 --> 01:39:29,598
back to the Dark Ages.

1795
01:39:30,598 --> 01:39:33,972
There were casualties, of course.
I knew a few of them.

1796
01:39:34,201 --> 01:39:38,247
Some guy from work, my
cousin Paul, Gary's mum.

1797
01:39:41,042 --> 01:39:43,443
Nobody really knew how many we lost,

1798
01:39:43,444 --> 01:39:46,112
because we never heard from
the rest of the world again.

1799
01:39:46,113 --> 01:39:48,054
<i>Everyone got cut off.</i>

1800
01:39:48,816 --> 01:39:51,656
<i>It isn't easy now, but it is simpler.</i>

1801
01:39:51,986 --> 01:39:54,454
<i>I'm back with the wife, which is something.</i>

1802
01:39:54,455 --> 01:39:58,491
<i>We decided our problems didn't seem
as bad in the grand scheme of things,</i>

1803
01:39:58,492 --> 01:40:02,429
<i>We all had to go organic in
a big way, but if I'm honest,</i>

1804
01:40:02,430 --> 01:40:06,237
<i>I'm hard pressed to recall any
processed foods I actually miss.</i>

1805
01:40:09,970 --> 01:40:13,549
As for the blanks, well, a
funny thing happened there.

1806
01:40:14,275 --> 01:40:15,954
They woke up.

1807
01:40:16,110 --> 01:40:20,486
<i>A week or so after The Network pulled out,
they just sort of rebooted by themselves,</i>

1808
01:40:21,282 --> 01:40:23,155
<i>tried to start afresh.</i>

1809
01:40:24,552 --> 01:40:28,723
<i>They seemed lost at first, children
cut off from their parents,</i>

1810
01:40:29,190 --> 01:40:34,066
<i>abandoned, forgotten, looking for guidance,
for someone to show them the way.</i>

1811
01:40:35,029 --> 01:40:37,209
<i>I felt a bit sorry for them, to be honest.</i>

1812
01:40:38,766 --> 01:40:40,600
<i>The Network was right about one thing.</i>

1813
01:40:40,601 --> 01:40:43,179
<i>We can be a bit uncivilized.</i>

1814
01:40:43,637 --> 01:40:47,512
<i>Maybe we would've been a bad
influence on the rest of the galaxy.</i>

1815
01:40:48,175 --> 01:40:51,010
<i>Oliver went back to being an estate agent.</i>

1816
01:40:51,011 --> 01:40:53,313
<i>People still need a roof over their heads,</i>

1817
01:40:53,314 --> 01:40:55,849
<i>and the old Ollie always
had a gift for the gab.</i>

1818
01:40:55,850 --> 01:40:58,985
<i>I guess the new one has, too.</i>
<font color=#ff00ff>[CHUCKLES]</font>

1819
01:40:58,986 --> 01:41:00,893
<i>He's doing all right.</i>

1820
01:41:01,655 --> 01:41:04,426
<i>I hear that the Peter found his
way home to Bishop's Gardens.</i>

1821
01:41:04,558 --> 01:41:08,570
<i>I suppose he picked up
where the other one left off.</i>

1822
01:41:09,363 --> 01:41:11,873
<i>I'm not sure his wife noticed.</i>

1823
01:41:11,999 --> 01:41:16,477
<i>Maybe she chose not to. He's a
pretty good dad by all accounts.</i>

1824
01:41:18,439 --> 01:41:21,274
<i>Steven and Sam got together in the end.</i>

1825
01:41:21,275 --> 01:41:23,243
<i>Didn't see that coming.</i>

1826
01:41:23,244 --> 01:41:25,512
<i>They shacked up just outside London.</i>

1827
01:41:25,513 --> 01:41:27,989
<i>It's a pretty nice shack, too.</i>

1828
01:41:28,249 --> 01:41:31,555
As for Gary? I don't know
what happened to Gary.

1829
01:41:32,520 --> 01:41:35,701
We got separated and I never saw him again.

1830
01:41:36,590 --> 01:41:40,260
Some say he went back to Newton Haven.
I don't know why.

1831
01:41:40,828 --> 01:41:43,030
I think his business there was done.

1832
01:41:44,031 --> 01:41:47,075
<i>It's funny, but I miss him.</i>

1833
01:41:47,868 --> 01:41:51,914
<i>I wonder if he misses me. Misses the boys.</i>

1834
01:41:58,412 --> 01:42:01,092
<i>Wherever he is, I hope he's happy.</i>

1835
01:42:01,248 --> 01:42:03,283
<i>That's all he ever wanted, really.</i>

1836
01:42:03,284 --> 01:42:05,122
<i>To have a good time.</i>

1837
01:42:05,519 --> 01:42:08,791
<i>I just hope he found it
beyond the bottom of a glass.</i>

1838
01:42:09,757 --> 01:42:14,667
<i>Because real happiness, real friends,
those are things worth living for,</i>

1839
01:42:16,197 --> 01:42:18,070
<i>worth fighting for.</i>

1840
01:42:30,077 --> 01:42:31,654
Blank bastards.

1841
01:42:34,915 --> 01:42:36,788
Fucking robots.

1842
01:42:45,693 --> 01:42:47,463
Five waters, please.

1843
01:42:49,597 --> 01:42:51,299
You can have one.

1844
01:42:51,966 --> 01:42:53,867
But I ain't serving this scum.

1845
01:42:53,868 --> 01:42:57,103
Well, I'm afraid it's all
for one and one for all.

1846
01:42:57,104 --> 01:42:59,472
You see, my young friends
and I are on an adventure.

1847
01:42:59,473 --> 01:43:03,142
A quest, if you will. And since we
find ourselves in need of refreshment,

1848
01:43:03,143 --> 01:43:06,051
you, sir, have the honor
of drawing first blood.

1849
01:43:07,014 --> 01:43:09,285
So, I'll ask you again,

1850
01:43:09,483 --> 01:43:11,162
for the last time,

1851
01:43:12,319 --> 01:43:15,591
five waters, please.

1852
01:43:23,797 --> 01:43:26,443
Who the hell do you think you are?

1853
01:43:26,634 --> 01:43:30,680
Me? They call me The King.
