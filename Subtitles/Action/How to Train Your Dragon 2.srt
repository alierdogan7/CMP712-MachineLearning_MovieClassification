00:09:03,010 --> 00:09:04,142
(Laughs)
He's down!

187
00:09:04,144 --> 00:09:06,144
And it's ugly!

188
00:09:06,146 --> 00:09:07,746
Dragons and vikings...

189
00:09:07,748 --> 00:09:09,147
(Grunts)
Enemies again...

190
00:09:09,149 --> 00:09:11,583
Locked in combat
to the bitter...

191
00:09:11,585 --> 00:09:13,552
Oh...!

192
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:18,323
(Stammering, groaning)

193
00:09:18,325 --> 00:09:21,026
You know that
doesn't wash out.

194
00:09:21,028 --> 00:09:23,128
(Rhythmic grunts)

195
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:26,031

196

¶ ¶

199
00:09:46,152 --> 00:09:48,186
so, what should we name it?

200
00:09:48,188 --> 00:09:50,822
"Itchy armpit" it is.

201
00:09:51,891 --> 00:09:53,325
What do you reckon, bud?

202
00:09:53,327 --> 00:09:56,194
Think we might find a few
timberjacks in those woods?

203
00:09:56,196 --> 00:09:59,297
The odd whispering death
or two in the rocks?

204
00:10:00,833 --> 00:10:03,935
Who knows, maybe
we'll finally track down

205
00:10:03,937 --> 00:10:05,704
another night fury.

206
00:10:05,706 --> 00:10:06,838
(Toothless grunts quietly)

207
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,873
Wouldn't that be something.

208
00:10:08,875 --> 00:10:10,909
(Sighs):
So, what do you say?

209
00:10:10,911 --> 00:10:12,344
Just keep going?

210
00:10:12,346 --> 00:10:14,279
(Low warbling)

211
00:10:14,281 --> 00:10:15,847
(Dragon screeches
in distance)

212
00:10:18,084 --> 00:10:21,286
(Screeching)

213
00:10:22,355 --> 00:10:24,089
Afternoon, milady.

214
00:10:24,091 --> 00:10:28,093
Hiccup: Where have you been?
(Giggles) Hi.

215
00:10:28,095 --> 00:10:31,363
Oh, winning races.
What else?

216
00:10:31,365 --> 00:10:33,698
The real question is,

217
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:35,000
where have you been?

218
00:10:35,002 --> 00:10:38,036
Avoiding my dad.
Oh, no.
What happened now?

219
00:10:38,038 --> 00:10:40,372
Oh, you're gonna...
You're gonna love this.

220
00:10:40,374 --> 00:10:42,407
I wake up,
the sun's shining,

221
00:10:42,409 --> 00:10:44,042
terrible terrors are

222
00:10:44,044 --> 00:10:45,210
singing on the rooftop,

223
00:10:45,212 --> 00:10:46,878
I saunter down to breakfast

224
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:49,280
thinking all is right
with the world, and I get:

225
00:10:49,282 --> 00:10:51,850
(Imitates stoick):
"Son, we need to talk."

226
00:10:51,852 --> 00:10:54,719
(Like hiccup): "Not, now, dad.
I got a whole day of goofing off

227
00:10:54,721 --> 00:10:55,887
to get started."

228
00:10:55,889 --> 00:10:57,656
(Laughs):
Okay, first of all,

229
00:10:57,658 --> 00:11:00,258
I-I don't sound like that.
What is this character?

230
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:02,260
(Laughs)
And-and second...

231
00:11:02,262 --> 00:11:04,696
What is that thing you're
doing with my shoulders?

232
00:11:04,698 --> 00:11:08,033
Yeah, that's-that's a really
flattering impersonation.

233
00:11:08,035 --> 00:11:10,001
Anyway, he goes...

234
00:11:10,003 --> 00:11:12,170
"You're the pride of berk, son,

235
00:11:12,172 --> 00:11:15,440
and I couldn't be prouder."
Aw, thanks, dad.

236
00:11:15,442 --> 00:11:18,276
I'm pretty impressed
with myself, too.

237
00:11:18,278 --> 00:11:21,246
(Laughing): When have I ever
done that with my hands?

238
00:11:21,248 --> 00:11:22,881
You just did!

239
00:11:22,883 --> 00:11:24,816
Okay, just...

240
00:11:24,818 --> 00:11:26,217
Hold... still.

241
00:11:26,219 --> 00:11:27,452
(Laughs)

242
00:11:27,454 --> 00:11:29,854
Very serious.
Mm-hmm.

243
00:11:31,424 --> 00:11:33,425
(Imitates stoick):
"You're all grown up,

244
00:11:33,427 --> 00:11:36,261
"and since no chief could ask
for a better successor,

245
00:11:36,263 --> 00:11:38,930
I've decided..."
To make you chief!
Oh, my gods!

246
00:11:38,932 --> 00:11:41,099
Hiccup, that's amazing!

247
00:11:41,101 --> 00:11:42,701
(Grunts) Oh...!

248
00:11:42,703 --> 00:11:45,003
Y-you're gonna wear
out the spring coil.

249
00:11:45,005 --> 00:11:47,305
The calibration
is very sensitive.

250
00:11:47,307 --> 00:11:49,774
(Screeching)
(Both yell, grunt)

251
00:11:49,776 --> 00:11:51,910
(Groaning)
(Hiccup sputters)

252
00:11:51,912 --> 00:11:54,913
Yeah, so... this is

253
00:11:54,915 --> 00:11:56,781
what I'm dealing with.

254
00:11:56,783 --> 00:11:58,049
What did you tell him?

255
00:11:58,051 --> 00:11:59,417
I-I didn't.

256
00:11:59,419 --> 00:12:00,819
By the time he turned
around, I was gone.

257
00:12:00,821 --> 00:12:02,187
Huh.

258
00:12:02,189 --> 00:12:05,990
Well... it's a lot
of responsibility.

259
00:12:05,992 --> 00:12:08,293
The map will have
to wait, for sure,

260
00:12:08,295 --> 00:12:09,928
and... and I'll need

261
00:12:09,930 --> 00:12:12,831
to fly toothless, since
you'll be too busy, but...

262
00:12:13,899 --> 00:12:15,233
(Soft gasp)

263
00:12:15,235 --> 00:12:18,336
I-it's not me, Astrid.

264
00:12:18,338 --> 00:12:21,506
All those speeches and planning
and running the village,

265
00:12:21,508 --> 00:12:23,141
that's his thing.

266
00:12:23,143 --> 00:12:25,343
I think you're
missing the point.

267
00:12:25,345 --> 00:12:26,945
I mean-- chief.

268
00:12:26,947 --> 00:12:28,379
What an honor!

269
00:12:28,381 --> 00:12:29,948
I'd be pretty excited.

270
00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:32,851
I-I... I'm not like you.

271
00:12:32,853 --> 00:12:35,120
You... know exactly
who you are,

272
00:12:35,122 --> 00:12:37,455
you always have, but...

273
00:12:37,457 --> 00:12:39,491
I'm still looking.

274
00:12:39,493 --> 00:12:42,260
I know that I'm
not my father,

275
00:12:42,262 --> 00:12:45,296
and I never met
my mother, so...

276
00:12:45,298 --> 00:12:47,432
What does that make me?

277
00:12:53,239 --> 00:12:57,375
What you're searching for
isn't out there, hiccup...

278
00:12:57,377 --> 00:12:59,944
It's in here.

279
00:12:59,946 --> 00:13:03,081
Maybe you just
don't see it yet.

280
00:13:03,083 --> 00:13:05,116
Ugh. Ugh!
Maybe.

281
00:13:05,118 --> 00:13:06,918
But, you know...

282
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:09,788
There is something
out there.

283
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:11,489
Hiccup...

Hiccup!

Man: Fire!
Astrid, look out!

Ooh!

309
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:42,447
(Amazed gasps)
Back again!

310
00:14:43,949 --> 00:14:46,384
Soil my britches.

311
00:14:46,386 --> 00:14:49,187
That is a night fury.

312
00:14:49,189 --> 00:14:51,289
Thought they were
all gone for good.

313
00:14:51,291 --> 00:14:53,024
Looks like our
luck's had a turn

314
00:14:53,026 --> 00:14:54,392
for the better, lads!

315
00:14:54,394 --> 00:14:56,361
Don't think drago
has one of those...

316
00:14:56,363 --> 00:14:58,196
In his dragon army.

317
00:14:58,198 --> 00:14:59,497
Dragon army?

318
00:14:59,499 --> 00:15:01,499
Look, we don't
want any trouble.

319
00:15:01,501 --> 00:15:03,935
Hah! You should
have thought of that

320
00:15:03,937 --> 00:15:06,404
before you stole
all of our dragons

321
00:15:06,406 --> 00:15:07,972
and blasted our
fort to bits!

322
00:15:07,974 --> 00:15:09,674
Man: That's right!
Man 2: Yeah, look it at!

323
00:15:09,676 --> 00:15:11,109
Hiccup:
Wait.

324
00:15:11,111 --> 00:15:12,343
What are you
talking about?

325
00:15:12,345 --> 00:15:13,978
You think we did this?

326
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:17,582
Hah! Dragon trapping is
hard enough work as it is

327
00:15:17,584 --> 00:15:20,018
without do-gooder dragon riders

328
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:23,988
sneaking in to rescue them.
What do-gooder...?

329
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:26,658
There are other dragon riders?
You mean

330
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:29,560
other than your thieving friend
from last night? You tell me.

331
00:15:29,562 --> 00:15:31,029
You may have

332
00:15:31,031 --> 00:15:32,664
an ice-spitting dragon
on your side,

333
00:15:32,666 --> 00:15:35,233
but we still have
a quota to fill.

334
00:15:35,235 --> 00:15:37,468
How do you suppose
we explain this mess

335
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:39,003
to drago bludvist?

336
00:15:39,005 --> 00:15:40,505
Drago what-fist?

337
00:15:40,507 --> 00:15:42,507
Does anything you
say make sense?

338
00:15:42,509 --> 00:15:44,342
He's expecting
a new shipment of dragons

339
00:15:44,344 --> 00:15:46,544
for his army by tomorrow.

340
00:15:46,546 --> 00:15:50,248
And drago don't
take well to excuses!

341
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:52,083
This is what he gave me

342
00:15:52,085 --> 00:15:54,452
last time I showed up
empty-handed.

343
00:15:54,454 --> 00:15:58,556
He promised to be far less
understanding in the future.

344
00:15:58,558 --> 00:16:01,426
All right, look, we don't know
anything about a dragon thief

345
00:16:01,428 --> 00:16:02,694
or an ice-spitting dragon

346
00:16:02,696 --> 00:16:04,696
or your lunatic boss

347
00:16:04,698 --> 00:16:07,131
and his dragon army, okay?

348
00:16:07,133 --> 00:16:10,234
Just give us back our dragon,
and we'll go...

349
00:16:10,236 --> 00:16:13,037
Strange, hostile person
whom we've never met.

350
00:16:13,039 --> 00:16:15,039
Oh, where are my manners?
(Chuckles)

351
00:16:15,041 --> 00:16:16,441
I'm eret...

352
00:16:16,443 --> 00:16:19,243
Son of eret.

353
00:16:19,245 --> 00:16:21,512
Finest dragon trapper alive.

354
00:16:21,514 --> 00:16:23,314
Others: Yeah.
After all...

355
00:16:23,316 --> 00:16:27,285
It's not just anyone
who can capture a night fury.

356
00:16:27,287 --> 00:16:29,320
And this is toothless.

357
00:16:29,322 --> 00:16:31,589
He says we're going. Now.

358
00:16:31,591 --> 00:16:32,724
Hah!

359
00:16:32,726 --> 00:16:34,325
They all say that.

360
00:16:34,327 --> 00:16:35,593
Rush 'em, lads!

361
00:16:35,595 --> 00:16:38,763
(Men shouting)

362
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:44,068
Astrid:
Stormfly, come on!

363
00:16:44,070 --> 00:16:45,336
Go! Go!

364
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:50,341
You will

365
00:16:50,343 --> 00:16:52,210
never hold on to
those dragons!

366
00:16:52,212 --> 00:16:53,511
You hear me?!

367
00:16:53,513 --> 00:16:56,280
Drago is coming for them all!

368
00:16:58,784 --> 00:17:02,553
Come on, meatlug!
Whoo-hoo!
Yahoo!

369
00:17:02,555 --> 00:17:04,555
(Dragons chittering)

370
00:17:04,557 --> 00:17:06,324
(Shouting happily)
(Startled shriek)

371
00:17:06,326 --> 00:17:08,226
(Grunts)

372
00:17:08,228 --> 00:17:11,195
(Laughing)

373
00:17:11,197 --> 00:17:12,296
Hey there, stoick!
Hey, how are you?

374
00:17:12,298 --> 00:17:13,765
Beautiful day.

375
00:17:13,767 --> 00:17:16,067
Hello, spitelout. Great race.
Yeah... (Mumbling)

376
00:17:16,069 --> 00:17:17,635
Oh! Sorry, Mrs. ack.

377
00:17:17,637 --> 00:17:20,338
(Quietly): Any sign of him?
Eh! He's probably flown

378
00:17:20,340 --> 00:17:22,640
off the edge
of the world by now.

379
00:17:22,642 --> 00:17:25,109
You sure you want that kid
running the village?

380
00:17:25,111 --> 00:17:27,211
You can still delay
your retirement.

381
00:17:27,213 --> 00:17:29,781
Oh, he's ready.
You'll see.

382
00:17:29,783 --> 00:17:32,383
(Hearty laugh)
There he is!

383
00:17:32,385 --> 00:17:35,053
Huh?
The pride of berk!

384
00:17:36,522 --> 00:17:39,657
Who finally decided
to show up for work. Yay.

385
00:17:39,659 --> 00:17:41,426
Sorry, got held up.
Hey, uh, dad,

386
00:17:41,428 --> 00:17:42,760
could I have a word?

387
00:17:42,762 --> 00:17:44,429
Something you're
itching to tell me?

388
00:17:44,431 --> 00:17:47,465
Uh, not quite the itch
you're thinking of, but, yes.

389
00:17:47,467 --> 00:17:48,666
Oh, good man!

390
00:17:48,668 --> 00:17:50,701
Now, lesson one:
A chief's first duty

391
00:17:50,703 --> 00:17:52,070
is to his people,

392
00:17:52,072 --> 00:17:53,404
so... 41!

393
00:17:53,406 --> 00:17:55,273
Well, can we just
talk in private for...

394
00:17:55,275 --> 00:17:56,307
Forty...
Man: That's me!

395
00:17:56,309 --> 00:17:57,542
That's me! I'm next!

396
00:17:57,544 --> 00:17:58,609
Man 2: Hey, I was
ahead of you!

397
00:17:58,611 --> 00:18:00,111
If we could just talk...

398
00:18:00,113 --> 00:18:02,180
Excuse me.
I've been here all day.

399
00:18:02,182 --> 00:18:04,549
Okay, okay, I want one
of those high seaters

400
00:18:04,551 --> 00:18:07,819
with lots of spikes and a
big storage compartment!

401
00:18:07,821 --> 00:18:11,322
Absolutely! You got it, sir.
Dad, this is actually

402
00:18:11,324 --> 00:18:13,124
a little more important
than building saddles.

403
00:18:13,126 --> 00:18:15,293
Ah, lesson two:
No task is too small

404
00:18:15,295 --> 00:18:17,195
when it comes
to serving your people.

405
00:18:17,197 --> 00:18:19,297
But, dad...
Oh, excuse us, grump.

406
00:18:19,299 --> 00:18:21,599
Can we just talk...
Yah! Grump!

407
00:18:21,601 --> 00:18:23,835
You let the forge
die down again!

408
00:18:23,837 --> 00:18:25,570
(Grumbles)

409
00:18:25,572 --> 00:18:26,838
(Yells)

410
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:29,674
Ah...

411
00:18:29,676 --> 00:18:31,709
Gobber: That's it, grump!
You're going up for adoption.

412
00:18:31,711 --> 00:18:33,311
Okay, uh...
There you go.

413
00:18:33,313 --> 00:18:35,580
Dad... yeah, but seriously,
go on. Have away.

414
00:18:35,582 --> 00:18:40,118
I really need to tell you about
this new land we came across.

415
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:41,786
Another one?
Any new dragons?

416
00:18:41,788 --> 00:18:43,654
We didn't stick
around to find out.

417
00:18:43,656 --> 00:18:46,424
These folks weren't
particularly friendly.

418
00:18:46,426 --> 00:18:47,592
Gobber:
Oh, really?

419
00:18:47,594 --> 00:18:49,360
Your night fury
and deadly nadder

420
00:18:49,362 --> 00:18:51,829
didn't bring them
cheering to the rooftops?

421
00:18:51,831 --> 00:18:53,364
No, this was different.

422
00:18:53,366 --> 00:18:55,333
Not the standard
run-for-the-hills hoo-ha

423
00:18:55,335 --> 00:18:56,667
I've come to enjoy.

424
00:18:56,669 --> 00:18:59,604
These guys were trappers.

425
00:18:59,606 --> 00:19:01,372
Dragon trappers.

426
00:19:01,374 --> 00:19:02,807
You should have seen their fort.

427
00:19:02,809 --> 00:19:05,810
All blown apart and stuck
in giant spikes of ice.

428
00:19:05,812 --> 00:19:07,278
It was weird.

429
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:08,880
I've never seen
anything like it.

430
00:19:08,882 --> 00:19:11,549
A-and worst of all,
they thought we did it!

431
00:19:11,551 --> 00:19:14,385
You know, you two are gonna get
yourselves in serious trouble

432
00:19:14,387 --> 00:19:15,720
one of these days.

433
00:19:15,722 --> 00:19:18,890
Not everyone appreciates
this way of life.

434
00:19:18,892 --> 00:19:20,191
Aye, gobber's
right, son.

435
00:19:20,193 --> 00:19:21,859
Best we keep to our own.

436
00:19:21,861 --> 00:19:24,929
Besides, you'll have more
important uses for your time.

437
00:19:24,931 --> 00:19:26,764
Huh-huh?

438
00:19:26,766 --> 00:19:29,667
Once we make
the big announcement!

439
00:19:29,669 --> 00:19:32,670
They are building
a dragon army.

440
00:19:34,206 --> 00:19:37,708
Or-or at least the guy
they work for is. Uh...

441
00:19:37,710 --> 00:19:40,545
"Dargo... bloody fist"
or something.

442
00:19:42,447 --> 00:19:44,549
I'll bloody his
fist with my face

443
00:19:44,551 --> 00:19:46,617
if he tries to
take my dragon!

444
00:19:46,619 --> 00:19:47,652
Or mine!

445
00:19:47,654 --> 00:19:49,387
Ugh! You're such a moron.

446
00:19:49,389 --> 00:19:50,655
A beautiful moron.

447
00:19:50,657 --> 00:19:52,190
Yeah.
(Disgusted groan)

448
00:19:52,192 --> 00:19:55,359
Bludvist? Drago bludvist?

449
00:19:55,361 --> 00:19:57,195
Uh, yeah. Wait...

450
00:19:57,197 --> 00:19:58,729
You know him?

451
00:20:01,533 --> 00:20:03,801
Ground all dragons!
Hiccup: What? Why?

452
00:20:03,803 --> 00:20:05,670
Stoick:
Seal the gates!

453
00:20:05,672 --> 00:20:07,805
Lower the storm doors!
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
wait, wait.

454
00:20:07,807 --> 00:20:09,373
What is happening?
Gobber: Come on!

455
00:20:09,375 --> 00:20:10,741
You heard the man!
Lock it down!

456
00:20:10,743 --> 00:20:14,445
(Urgent chatter)
Stoick: No dragon or viking

457
00:20:14,447 --> 00:20:17,648
sets foot off this island
until I give the word!

458
00:20:17,650 --> 00:20:19,750
Wait, because some guy you knew
is stirring up trouble

459
00:20:19,752 --> 00:20:20,985
in some faraway land?

460
00:20:20,987 --> 00:20:23,921
Because drago bludvist
is a madman

461
00:20:23,923 --> 00:20:26,357
without conscience
or mercy.

462
00:20:26,359 --> 00:20:28,259
And if he's built
a dragon army,

463
00:20:28,261 --> 00:20:29,827
gods help us all.

464
00:20:29,829 --> 00:20:30,995
Get them into
their pens!

465
00:20:30,997 --> 00:20:32,730
Quickly!
Aye, stoick.

466
00:20:32,732 --> 00:20:34,665
Then let's ride
back out there.

467
00:20:34,667 --> 00:20:36,667
We'll follow those
trappers to drago

468
00:20:36,669 --> 00:20:38,469
and talk some
sense into him.

469
00:20:38,471 --> 00:20:39,937
No. We fortify the island.

470
00:20:39,939 --> 00:20:41,973
It's our duty to
keep the peace.

471
00:20:41,975 --> 00:20:43,708
Peace is over, hiccup.

472
00:20:43,710 --> 00:20:46,711
I must prepare you for war.
War?

473
00:20:46,713 --> 00:20:48,980
Dad, if drago's
coming for our dragons,

474
00:20:48,982 --> 00:20:51,849
we can't wait around
for him to get here.

475
00:20:51,851 --> 00:20:55,319
Let's go find him
and change his mind.

476
00:20:55,321 --> 00:20:57,321
No, some minds
won't be changed, hiccup.

477
00:20:57,323 --> 00:20:59,724
Berk is what you need
to worry about.

478
00:20:59,726 --> 00:21:02,293
A chief protects his own.

479
00:21:02,295 --> 00:21:03,728
(Warbles quietly)

480
00:21:03,730 --> 00:21:06,264
Stoick: Secure the stables!
Latch every stall!

481
00:21:06,266 --> 00:21:08,266
Hiccup, don't.
I have to.

482
00:21:08,268 --> 00:21:09,600
Stoick:
This way!

483
00:21:09,602 --> 00:21:10,801
Quickly!
(Toothless screeches)

484
00:21:12,004 --> 00:21:14,005
Hiccup!

485
00:21:15,674 --> 00:21:16,841
Come on!

486
00:21:18,277 --> 00:21:20,311
Hiccup!
Aah!

487
00:21:22,447 --> 00:21:24,715
¶ ¶

488
00:21:24,717 --> 00:21:26,017
(deep, grumbling sigh)

489
00:21:30,355 --> 00:21:32,356
Eret:
Keep your eyes peeled, lads!

490
00:21:32,358 --> 00:21:35,393
With this wind,
we'll reach drago by daybreak.

491
00:21:35,395 --> 00:21:38,763
So best we fill this ship up
with dragons, and quick!

492
00:21:38,765 --> 00:21:40,364
It's no time to be picky!

493
00:21:40,366 --> 00:21:41,632
Uh, eret?

494
00:21:41,634 --> 00:21:43,868
Not if we want to keep our...

495
00:21:45,404 --> 00:21:46,637
...heads!

496
00:21:46,639 --> 00:21:48,572
Off the port quarter!

497
00:21:48,574 --> 00:21:50,775
Net them, lads!
Take them down!

498
00:21:50,777 --> 00:21:53,311
Man: There's two of them!
Up on the left!

499
00:21:53,313 --> 00:21:56,414
Eret: You're not
getting away this time.

500
00:21:56,416 --> 00:21:57,581
Fire!

501
00:21:57,583 --> 00:21:59,583
Reload!
Reload!

502
00:21:59,585 --> 00:22:02,753
Come on, reload!
Incoming!

503
00:22:02,755 --> 00:22:03,988
Man:
Steady yourselves, mates.

504
00:22:03,990 --> 00:22:06,357
Eret:
And here I was,

505
00:22:06,359 --> 00:22:08,659
worried we might turn up
empty-handed.

506
00:22:08,661 --> 00:22:10,695
Nope.
It's your lucky day.

507
00:22:10,697 --> 00:22:12,029
We give up.

508
00:22:13,432 --> 00:22:15,099
That's one night fury,

509
00:22:15,101 --> 00:22:17,802
uh, one deadly nadder, and...

510
00:22:17,804 --> 00:22:20,838
Two of the finest dragon
riders west of luk tuk.

511
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:22,640
That ought to make the boss
happy, right?

512
00:22:22,642 --> 00:22:23,808
(Toothless growls)

513
00:22:23,810 --> 00:22:25,409
Excuse us.

514
00:22:25,411 --> 00:22:26,644
(Whispers):
What are you doing?

515
00:22:26,646 --> 00:22:28,346
Hiccup:
Toothless, stay.

516
00:22:28,348 --> 00:22:29,714
(Curious grunt)

517
00:22:29,716 --> 00:22:31,682
Hiccup: Uh, the dragons
don't really care

518
00:22:31,684 --> 00:22:34,085
for cramped spaces, so they'll
just hang out with you.

519
00:22:34,087 --> 00:22:35,686
They won't be any trouble.

520
00:22:35,688 --> 00:22:36,821
(Men growling)

521
00:22:36,823 --> 00:22:39,023
Unless you do that.

522
00:22:39,025 --> 00:22:41,492
You know, wooden boats,
big ocean...

523
00:22:41,494 --> 00:22:43,361
H-how is your swimming?

524
00:22:43,363 --> 00:22:44,795
Not good.

525
00:22:44,797 --> 00:22:45,830
(All gasp)

526
00:22:45,832 --> 00:22:47,798
Oops. Almost forget.

527
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:50,101
Can't have armed prisoners.
Give me that.

528
00:22:50,103 --> 00:22:51,836
(Quietly):
How is this a plan?

529
00:22:51,838 --> 00:22:54,772
Just what every
dragon trapper needs.

530
00:22:54,774 --> 00:22:58,109
One end coats the blade
in monstrous nightmare saliva.

531
00:22:58,111 --> 00:23:00,878
The other sprays
hideous zippleback gas.

532
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:03,748
All it takes
is a spark, and...

533
00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:04,815
(Explosion)
(Men yelling)

534
00:23:04,817 --> 00:23:06,417
Hiccup:
Oh, yeah, there you go.

535
00:23:06,419 --> 00:23:07,852
(Coughing)

536
00:23:07,854 --> 00:23:09,854
Hiccup: Once they see you
as one of their own,

537
00:23:09,856 --> 00:23:11,088
even the testiest dragons
can be trained.

538
00:23:11,090 --> 00:23:12,423
Right, bud?

539
00:23:12,425 --> 00:23:15,459
Eret:
Give me that! (Grunts)

540
00:23:15,461 --> 00:23:17,461
What game are you playing?

541
00:23:17,463 --> 00:23:19,730
Hiccup: Uh, no game.
We just want to meet drago.

542
00:23:19,732 --> 00:23:21,465
(Grunts) Why?

543
00:23:21,467 --> 00:23:23,934
Because I'm going to change
his mind about dragons.

544
00:23:23,936 --> 00:23:27,471
(Others laughing)

545
00:23:27,473 --> 00:23:29,807
He can be really
persuasive.

546
00:23:29,809 --> 00:23:31,475
Once you've earned his loyalty,

547
00:23:31,477 --> 00:23:34,011
there is nothing a dragon
won't do for you.

548
00:23:34,013 --> 00:23:37,481
(Sputters) You won't be changing
any minds around here.

549
00:23:37,483 --> 00:23:40,885
I can change yours,
right here, right now.

550
00:23:40,887 --> 00:23:43,053
¶ ¶

551
00:23:43,055 --> 00:23:44,722
uh, may I?

552
00:23:44,724 --> 00:23:45,856
Waah!

553
00:23:48,493 --> 00:23:50,728
Watch it!
Eret: Dragon riders!

554
00:23:50,730 --> 00:23:52,530
(Men shouting indistinctly)

555
00:23:54,933 --> 00:23:56,901
(Bellowing)

556
00:23:56,903 --> 00:23:58,135
(Grunts curiously)

557
00:23:58,137 --> 00:23:59,537
Hiccup:
Put me down!

558
00:23:59,539 --> 00:24:01,605
Snotlout,
what-what are you doing?

559
00:24:01,607 --> 00:24:03,541
See how well I protect
and provide?

560
00:24:03,543 --> 00:24:04,742
(Groans, gasps)

561
00:24:04,744 --> 00:24:05,876
Tuffnut:
What is with all the nets?

562
00:24:05,878 --> 00:24:07,711
Ruffnut:
Hey, watch it! That was...

563
00:24:07,713 --> 00:24:10,014
Close.

564
00:24:12,818 --> 00:24:15,119
Oh, my.

565
00:24:18,757 --> 00:24:20,090
Me likey.

566
00:24:23,595 --> 00:24:25,996
Take me.

567
00:24:25,998 --> 00:24:29,033
(Groaning)

568
00:24:29,035 --> 00:24:30,234
Hold your fire! (Grunts)

569
00:24:31,870 --> 00:24:33,838
(Grunts)

570
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:35,072
(Grunts)

571
00:24:35,074 --> 00:24:37,007
Um, what are you guys
doing here?

572
00:24:37,009 --> 00:24:39,176
We're here to rescue you!

573
00:24:39,178 --> 00:24:40,945
I don't need to be rescued.

574
00:24:40,947 --> 00:24:42,780
Stoick: Enough!
(Dragon grumbles)

575
00:24:43,815 --> 00:24:46,183
Well, didn't you just pick

576
00:24:46,185 --> 00:24:47,985
the wrong ship, eh?

577
00:24:47,987 --> 00:24:49,820
I am eret, son of...

578
00:24:49,822 --> 00:24:50,821
(Muffled): Eret...

579
00:24:50,823 --> 00:24:52,256
(Growling)

580
00:24:52,258 --> 00:24:53,624
I...

581
00:24:53,626 --> 00:24:54,959
(Grunting, wheezing)

582
00:24:54,961 --> 00:24:57,161
Get this thing off me.

583
00:24:57,163 --> 00:24:58,829
Anyone else?

584
00:24:58,831 --> 00:25:00,698
Hmm, that's what I figured.

585
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:02,800
You, saddle up.

586
00:25:02,802 --> 00:25:04,001
We're going home.

587
00:25:04,003 --> 00:25:06,036
No.

588
00:25:06,038 --> 00:25:07,938
Of all the irresponsible...

589
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:10,908
I'm trying to protect
our dragons and stop a war.

590
00:25:10,910 --> 00:25:12,142
How is that irresponsible?

591
00:25:12,144 --> 00:25:14,778
Because war
is what he wants, son!

592
00:25:14,780 --> 00:25:17,014
(Sighs)

593
00:25:18,049 --> 00:25:20,751
(Sighs)

594
00:25:20,753 --> 00:25:23,721
Years ago, there was
a great gathering of chieftains

595
00:25:23,723 --> 00:25:26,257
<i> to discuss the dragon scourge</i>
<i> we all faced.</i>

596
00:25:26,259 --> 00:25:30,794
<i> Into our midst came a stranger</i>
<i> from a strange land,</i>

597
00:25:30,796 --> 00:25:34,565
<i> covered in scars and draped</i>
<i> in a cloak of dragon skin.</i>

598
00:25:34,567 --> 00:25:35,633
(Stranger speaks quietly)

599
00:25:35,635 --> 00:25:37,234
<i> He carried no weapon</i>

600
00:25:37,236 --> 00:25:38,936
<i> and spoke softly,</i>

601
00:25:38,938 --> 00:25:40,271
<i> saying that he,</i>

602
00:25:40,273 --> 00:25:42,640
<i> drago bludvist,</i>

603
00:25:42,642 --> 00:25:44,708
<i> was a man of the people,</i>

604
00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:49,280
<i> devoted to freeing mankind</i>
<i> from the tyranny of dragons.</i>

605
00:25:49,282 --> 00:25:51,749
<i> He claimed that he alone</i>
<i> could control the dragons,</i>

606
00:25:51,751 --> 00:25:54,118
<i> and that he alone</i>
<i> could keep us safe,</i>

607
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:57,254
<i> if we chose to bow down</i>

608
00:25:57,256 --> 00:26:00,791
<i> and follow him. </i>
(Laughter)

609
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:04,628
Stupid.
Ah, good one.

610
00:26:04,630 --> 00:26:06,830
Aye, we laughed, too...

611
00:26:06,832 --> 00:26:08,132
<i> Until he wrapped himself</i>
<i> in his cloak</i>

612
00:26:08,134 --> 00:26:09,767
<i> and cried out,</i>

613
00:26:09,769 --> 00:26:11,635
<i> "then see how well you do</i>
<i> without me!"</i>

614
00:26:11,637 --> 00:26:13,170
Drago: ...See how well
you do without me!

615
00:26:13,172 --> 00:26:16,206
<i> The rooftop suddenly burst</i>
<i> into flames,</i>

616
00:26:16,208 --> 00:26:20,010
<i> and from it,</i>
<i> armored dragons descended,</i>

617
00:26:20,012 --> 00:26:23,147
<i> burning the hall</i>
<i> to the ground.</i>

618
00:26:23,149 --> 00:26:25,983
I...

619
00:26:25,985 --> 00:26:28,619
Was the only one to escape.

620
00:26:33,258 --> 00:26:37,194
Men who kill without reason
cannot be reasoned with.

621
00:26:37,196 --> 00:26:39,063
Maybe.
Hiccup!

622
00:26:39,065 --> 00:26:41,131
I'm still going to try.

623
00:26:42,934 --> 00:26:44,802
This is what I'm good at,

624
00:26:44,804 --> 00:26:46,804
and-and if I could change
your mind,

625
00:26:46,806 --> 00:26:49,273
I can change his, too.

626
00:26:50,909 --> 00:26:52,309
Come on.

627
00:26:53,345 --> 00:26:54,678
Let's go.
No!

628
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:56,614
Lead the others back to berk.

629
00:26:56,616 --> 00:26:59,049
I've had enough mutiny
for one day.

630
00:26:59,051 --> 00:27:01,352
(Grumbling)

631
00:27:01,354 --> 00:27:03,120
Ooh, I like that.

632
00:27:03,122 --> 00:27:04,888
(Groans)
Stoick: Ruffnut!

633
00:27:04,890 --> 00:27:06,724
(Groans) Okay!

634
00:27:07,759 --> 00:27:09,727
Ah.
(Grunting)

635
00:27:11,896 --> 00:27:13,097
(Ruffnut chuckles)

636
00:27:13,099 --> 00:27:14,198
(Groans)

637
00:27:20,905 --> 00:27:24,108
(Screaming)

638
00:27:24,110 --> 00:27:25,743
(Curious grunt)

639
00:27:25,745 --> 00:27:27,311
(Sighs)

640
00:27:27,313 --> 00:27:28,979
Don't worry, bud.

641
00:27:28,981 --> 00:27:31,949
I'm not gonna let anything
happen to you.

642
00:27:31,951 --> 00:27:34,652
I promise.

643
00:27:34,654 --> 00:27:36,420
(Toothless growls)

644
00:27:37,989 --> 00:27:39,356
(Deep growling)

645
00:27:42,193 --> 00:27:43,961
Aw, come on, dad.

646
00:27:43,963 --> 00:27:45,663
Really?

647
00:27:47,165 --> 00:27:48,766
(Gasps)

648
00:27:53,672 --> 00:27:55,406
Okay.

649
00:27:55,408 --> 00:27:57,408
No sudden moves.

650
00:27:58,443 --> 00:28:00,444
(Dragon bellowing)

651
00:28:07,285 --> 00:28:09,253
¶ ¶

652
00:28:17,762 --> 00:28:19,730
¶ ¶

653
00:28:21,733 --> 00:28:23,133
hold on, hold on.

654
00:28:25,937 --> 00:28:27,237

Toothless...!

658
00:28:37,416 --> 00:28:39,383
(Screeching)

659
00:28:43,922 --> 00:28:45,889
(Screeching, growling)

00:28:55,133 --> 00:28:57,835

661
00:28:57,837 --> 00:28:59,903
(Whining)

662
00:29:04,175 --> 00:29:07,044
(Deep bellow)

663
00:29:11,416 --> 00:29:14,284
(Whimpers)

664
00:29:21,259 --> 00:29:23,227
¶ ¶

665
00:29:25,497 --> 00:29:27,097
hey!

666
00:29:27,099 --> 00:29:28,866
You left my dragon back there!

667
00:29:28,868 --> 00:29:31,301
He can't fly on his own!
He'll drown!

668
00:29:33,905 --> 00:29:35,105
(Dragons screeching)

669
00:29:42,814 --> 00:29:43,881
(Panting)

670
00:29:51,122 --> 00:29:53,457
(Grunts)

671
00:29:53,459 --> 00:29:55,793
Hey! Uh...

672
00:29:55,795 --> 00:29:57,828
We have to head back
for my dragon! (Gasps)

673
00:29:57,830 --> 00:29:59,329
(Snarling)

674
00:30:10,208 --> 00:30:12,176

678
00:30:26,125 --> 00:30:28,559

680
00:30:33,565 --> 00:30:35,165
(Inhales sharply)

681
00:30:40,905 --> 00:30:42,139
(Gasps)

682
00:30:43,908 --> 00:30:46,009
Who are you?

683
00:30:46,011 --> 00:30:48,879
The dragon thief?

684
00:30:48,881 --> 00:30:50,314
Uh...

685
00:30:50,316 --> 00:30:52,583
Drago bludvist?

686
00:30:52,585 --> 00:30:54,484
Do you even understand

687
00:30:54,486 --> 00:30:56,486
what I'm saying?

688
00:30:56,488 --> 00:30:58,922
(Rattling)
(Hiccup gasping)

689
00:30:58,924 --> 00:31:00,958
(Screeching)

690
00:31:01,492 --> 00:31:03,227
Toothless!

691
00:31:03,229 --> 00:31:06,029
Oh, it's okay,
it's okay, it's okay.

692
00:31:06,031 --> 00:31:08,131
I'm glad to see you,
too, bud.

693
00:31:08,133 --> 00:31:09,366
You really had me worried there.

694
00:31:09,368 --> 00:31:10,467
(Toothless grumbles)

695
00:31:12,103 --> 00:31:14,071

Uh, uh...

00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:50,240
(Gasps)

702
00:31:51,676 --> 00:31:53,410

703
00:31:54,646 --> 00:31:56,179
(Muffled):
Oh...

704
00:31:56,181 --> 00:31:57,481
(Softly):
Hiccup?

705
00:31:57,483 --> 00:31:59,383
Uh...

706
00:32:01,986 --> 00:32:03,654
C-could it be?

707
00:32:03,656 --> 00:32:06,990
After all these years?

708
00:32:06,992 --> 00:32:09,493
How is this possible?

709
00:32:09,495 --> 00:32:12,129
Uh, should I...

710
00:32:12,131 --> 00:32:13,463
Should I know you?

711
00:32:13,465 --> 00:32:15,632
No.

712
00:32:15,634 --> 00:32:17,334
You were only a babe.

713
00:32:23,041 --> 00:32:25,442
But a mother never forgets.

714
00:32:26,611 --> 00:32:29,179
(Gasps)

715
00:32:29,181 --> 00:32:31,148
Shh, shh.

716
00:32:33,685 --> 00:32:35,352
Come.

717
00:32:35,354 --> 00:32:37,187
Stoick:
Boar-headed!

718
00:32:37,189 --> 00:32:38,522
Just like his mother!

719
00:32:38,524 --> 00:32:40,524
Aye, she could never
stay put, either.

720
00:32:40,526 --> 00:32:41,591
Gobber:
Eh, he's just 20,

721
00:32:41,593 --> 00:32:43,160
and a viking.

722
00:32:43,162 --> 00:32:44,628
I mean, could there be
a worse combination?

723
00:32:44,630 --> 00:32:48,131
Heh! When I think
of how stubborn and senseless

724
00:32:48,133 --> 00:32:50,567
you were back in the day.

725
00:32:50,569 --> 00:32:52,269
Oh.

726
00:32:52,271 --> 00:32:55,005
Well, not much
has changed, actually.

727
00:32:55,007 --> 00:32:56,606
(Sighs)

728
00:32:56,608 --> 00:32:58,241
Ah, you know what he's like.

729
00:32:58,243 --> 00:33:00,110
He won't give up, gobber.

730
00:33:00,112 --> 00:33:02,713
And if hiccup finds drago

731
00:33:02,715 --> 00:33:05,048
before we find him...

732
00:33:05,050 --> 00:33:06,583
Ah!
Nothing can hurt hiccup,

733
00:33:06,585 --> 00:33:08,719
so long as that
night fury's around.

734
00:33:08,721 --> 00:33:10,187
It's a night fury!

735
00:33:12,256 --> 00:33:13,557
(Dragon bellows)

736
00:33:13,559 --> 00:33:16,259
Huh?

737
00:33:20,198 --> 00:33:21,264
(Groans)

738
00:33:21,266 --> 00:33:23,300
(Grunts)

739
00:33:25,103 --> 00:33:26,436
(Sighs)

740
00:33:26,438 --> 00:33:28,338
(Gasping)

741
00:33:29,741 --> 00:33:31,441
Find them, skullcrusher.

742
00:33:31,443 --> 00:33:33,143
(Deep grunt)

743
00:33:33,145 --> 00:33:34,478
Find them.

744
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:35,679
(Bellowing)

745
00:33:41,753 --> 00:33:43,687
Uh, h-hold on.
Wait just a minute.

746
00:33:43,689 --> 00:33:45,088
This way.
Come back here.

747
00:33:45,090 --> 00:33:46,723
Come.
You can't just say

748
00:33:46,725 --> 00:33:49,026
something like that and run off.

749
00:33:49,028 --> 00:33:50,494
You're my mother?!

750
00:33:50,496 --> 00:33:52,095
I mean, what the...?

751
00:33:52,097 --> 00:33:54,131
Do you... do you grasp how
insane it sounds?

752
00:33:54,133 --> 00:33:55,365
Come quickly.

753
00:33:55,367 --> 00:33:56,533
I have questions!

754
00:33:56,535 --> 00:33:58,402
(Grunting)
Where have you...

755
00:33:58,404 --> 00:34:00,404
Been all this time?
(Groans)

756
00:34:00,406 --> 00:34:01,571
(Groans)

757
00:34:01,573 --> 00:34:03,407
What-what have you been doing?

758
00:34:03,409 --> 00:34:06,343
But they-they said
you were dead!

759
00:34:06,345 --> 00:34:08,678
Everyone thinks
you were eaten by...

760
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:10,647
(Dragons bellowing,
screeching)

761
00:34:17,622 --> 00:34:19,589
(Chittering)

762
00:34:21,793 --> 00:34:23,093
(Gasps)

763
00:34:26,130 --> 00:34:28,098
(Bellowing)

764
00:34:31,536 --> 00:34:33,503
(Screeching, warbling)

765
00:34:39,811 --> 00:34:41,778
(Screeching, bellowing,
warbling continue)

766
00:34:43,548 --> 00:34:44,815
(Clears throat)

767
00:34:44,817 --> 00:34:46,149
(Gasps)

768
00:34:46,151 --> 00:34:49,152
(Low warbling)

769
00:34:49,154 --> 00:34:52,789
This is where you've been
for 20 years?

770
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:57,794
You-you've been rescuing them.

771
00:34:59,764 --> 00:35:02,632
Unbelievable.

772
00:35:02,634 --> 00:35:04,367
You're not upset?
What?

773
00:35:04,369 --> 00:35:06,169
No. I-I don't know. I...

774
00:35:06,171 --> 00:35:08,839
It's a bit much to get
my head around, to be Frank.

775
00:35:08,841 --> 00:35:11,708
It's not every day you find out
your mother

776
00:35:11,710 --> 00:35:15,879
is some kind of crazy, feral,
vigilante dragon lady.

777
00:35:15,881 --> 00:35:18,281
Oh... (Chuckles)

778
00:35:18,283 --> 00:35:19,883
Well...

779
00:35:19,885 --> 00:35:23,453
At least I'm not boring, right?
(Nervous chuckle)

780
00:35:23,455 --> 00:35:25,222
Well, I suppose there is that...

781
00:35:25,224 --> 00:35:28,325
One specific thing.

782
00:35:28,327 --> 00:35:30,160
Do-do you like it?

783
00:35:30,162 --> 00:35:31,228
I...

784
00:35:31,230 --> 00:35:32,496
I... I...

785
00:35:32,498 --> 00:35:34,464
I-I don't have the words.

786
00:35:34,466 --> 00:35:36,867
(Grumbling)

787
00:35:36,869 --> 00:35:39,469
(Sniffing)

788
00:35:39,471 --> 00:35:40,670
(Mother laughs)

789
00:35:40,672 --> 00:35:42,405
(Growls)

790
00:35:42,407 --> 00:35:44,608
C-can I...

791
00:35:44,610 --> 00:35:46,877
Oh, he's beautiful.

792
00:35:46,879 --> 00:35:48,478
Oh.

793
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:50,147
(Chuckles)

794
00:35:50,149 --> 00:35:51,314
Oh, incredible.

795
00:35:51,316 --> 00:35:53,683
(Mother laughing)

796
00:35:53,685 --> 00:35:55,886
He might very well be
the last of his kind.

797
00:35:55,888 --> 00:35:58,355
Oh... and look,

798
00:35:58,357 --> 00:35:59,890
he's your age.

799
00:35:59,892 --> 00:36:01,291
Wow.

800
00:36:01,293 --> 00:36:03,160
No wonder you get
along so well.

801
00:36:03,162 --> 00:36:04,494
Oh, yeah? Oh, yeah?

802
00:36:04,496 --> 00:36:06,363
(Laughs)

803
00:36:06,365 --> 00:36:08,899
And retractable teeth.

804
00:36:08,901 --> 00:36:11,201
How did you manage...

805
00:36:11,203 --> 00:36:12,736
I found him in the woods.

806
00:36:12,738 --> 00:36:16,306
He was shot down
and wounded.

807
00:36:16,308 --> 00:36:17,908
(Groans)

808
00:36:19,944 --> 00:36:22,679
This snafflefang lost his leg

809
00:36:22,681 --> 00:36:25,382
to one of drago bludvist's
iron traps.

810
00:36:25,384 --> 00:36:26,850
This raincutter

811
00:36:26,852 --> 00:36:29,219
had her wing sliced
by razor netting.

812
00:36:29,221 --> 00:36:31,588
And this, oh, poor hobblegrunt

813
00:36:31,590 --> 00:36:34,491
was blinded by a tree snare

814
00:36:34,493 --> 00:36:37,727
and then left to die alone
and scared.

815
00:36:37,729 --> 00:36:39,796
And what of this?

816
00:36:39,798 --> 00:36:42,799
Did drago or his trappers
do this, too?

817
00:36:42,801 --> 00:36:44,334
(Chuckles)
Oh.

818
00:36:44,336 --> 00:36:45,835
Yeah. (Grunts)

819
00:36:45,837 --> 00:36:49,573
Well, crazy thing is...

820
00:36:49,575 --> 00:36:53,510
I'm actually the one
who shot him down.

821
00:36:53,512 --> 00:36:56,279
Hey, it's-it's okay, though.

822
00:36:56,281 --> 00:36:57,347
He got me back.

823
00:36:57,349 --> 00:36:58,748
Right, bud?

824
00:36:58,750 --> 00:37:00,717
You couldn't save
all of me, could you?

825
00:37:00,719 --> 00:37:02,485
You just had to make it even.

826
00:37:02,487 --> 00:37:05,355
So peg leg.

827
00:37:05,357 --> 00:37:07,324
(Laughs, grumbling)

828
00:37:08,859 --> 00:37:10,460
(Chuckles)
Uh...

829
00:37:10,462 --> 00:37:12,963
What did your father think
of your night fury friend?

830
00:37:12,965 --> 00:37:15,999
Oh, he-he didn't take
it all that well.

831
00:37:16,001 --> 00:37:17,300
(Grunts)

832
00:37:17,302 --> 00:37:19,869
But then, he changed.

833
00:37:19,871 --> 00:37:21,004
They all did.

834
00:37:21,006 --> 00:37:22,606
Pretty soon,

835
00:37:22,608 --> 00:37:25,442
everyone back home had
dragons of their own.

836
00:37:25,444 --> 00:37:27,644
If only it were possible.

837
00:37:27,646 --> 00:37:28,745
No, really.

838
00:37:28,747 --> 00:37:30,814
Believe me, I tried, as well,

839
00:37:30,816 --> 00:37:33,850
but people are not capable
of change, hiccup.

840
00:37:33,852 --> 00:37:35,385
Some of us...

841
00:37:35,387 --> 00:37:37,654
(Squawks)
Were just born different.

842
00:37:37,656 --> 00:37:39,656
(Screeching)

843
00:37:39,658 --> 00:37:41,658
(Townsfolk screaming)

844
00:37:41,660 --> 00:37:43,927
(Man shouts a warning,
people clamor)

845
00:37:43,929 --> 00:37:46,863
Mother:
<i> Berk was a land of kill</i>

846
00:37:46,865 --> 00:37:48,431
<i> or be killed,</i>

847
00:37:48,433 --> 00:37:51,401
<i> but I believed peace</i>
<i> was possible.</i>

848
00:37:51,403 --> 00:37:52,669
(Viking warrior bellows)

849
00:37:52,671 --> 00:37:55,672
Stop!
You'll only make it worse!

850
00:37:55,674 --> 00:37:59,342
Mother:
<i> It was a very</i>
<i> unpopular opinion.</i>

851
00:37:59,344 --> 00:38:00,610
(Warrior yelling)

852
00:38:00,612 --> 00:38:02,512
Hiccup!

853
00:38:02,514 --> 00:38:04,314
Mother:
<i> Then one night,</i>

854
00:38:04,316 --> 00:38:07,417
<i> a dragon broke into our</i>
<i> house, finding you</i>

855
00:38:07,419 --> 00:38:08,985
<i> in the cradle. </i>
(Gasps)

856
00:38:08,987 --> 00:38:12,355
<i> I rushed to protect you.</i>

857
00:38:12,357 --> 00:38:14,324
(Baby hiccup giggling)

858
00:38:16,027 --> 00:38:21,331
<i> But what I saw was proof</i>
<i> of everything I believed.</i>

859
00:38:23,334 --> 00:38:25,302
(Cooing)

860
00:38:27,004 --> 00:38:29,873
(Baby hiccup crying,
thudding footsteps)

861
00:38:31,942 --> 00:38:34,044
(Grunts gently)

862
00:38:34,046 --> 00:38:36,746
<i> This wasn't a vicious beast,</i>

863
00:38:36,748 --> 00:38:39,683
<i> but an intelligent,</i>
<i> gentle creature,</i>

864
00:38:39,685 --> 00:38:43,386
<i> whose soul reflected my own.</i>

865
00:38:43,388 --> 00:38:45,021
(Stoick grunts, dragon bellows)

866
00:38:45,023 --> 00:38:48,391
Valka, run!
No, don't.

867
00:38:48,393 --> 00:38:50,593
(Valka gasps)

868
00:38:50,595 --> 00:38:52,896
Oh...

869
00:38:52,898 --> 00:38:54,064
Hold on!

870
00:38:54,066 --> 00:38:55,765
(Grunts)

871
00:38:55,767 --> 00:38:58,101
No! Aah! Stoick!

872
00:38:58,103 --> 00:39:00,470
Stoick:
Valka!

873
00:39:01,439 --> 00:39:04,074
Stoick!

874
00:39:04,076 --> 00:39:06,810
Valka.

875
00:39:06,812 --> 00:39:10,080
Valka:
<i> You and your father</i>
<i> nearly died</i>

876
00:39:10,082 --> 00:39:11,681
that night.

877
00:39:11,683 --> 00:39:14,684
All because
I couldn't kill a dragon.

878
00:39:14,686 --> 00:39:17,887
Eh, runs in the family.

879
00:39:17,889 --> 00:39:19,956
It broke my heart to stay away,

880
00:39:19,958 --> 00:39:23,426
but I believed
you'd be safer if I did.

881
00:39:24,829 --> 00:39:26,563
How did you survive?

882
00:39:26,565 --> 00:39:28,832
Oh, cloudjumper never meant
to harm me.

883
00:39:28,834 --> 00:39:32,969
He must have thought
I belonged here

884
00:39:32,971 --> 00:39:36,906
in the home of the
great bewilderbeast.

885
00:39:38,042 --> 00:39:40,110
The Alpha species.

886
00:39:40,112 --> 00:39:41,978
One of the very few

887
00:39:41,980 --> 00:39:43,947
that still exist.

888
00:39:44,982 --> 00:39:46,549
(Deep grumbling)

889
00:39:46,551 --> 00:39:47,684
Every nest has its queen,

890
00:39:47,686 --> 00:39:51,121
but this is the king
of all dragons.

891
00:39:51,123 --> 00:39:53,523
With his icy breath,

892
00:39:53,525 --> 00:39:56,126
this graceful giant
built our nest,

893
00:39:56,128 --> 00:39:59,562
a safe haven for
dragons everywhere.

894
00:39:59,564 --> 00:40:01,865
Wait, that's the ice-spitter?

895
00:40:01,867 --> 00:40:03,733
He's responsible

896
00:40:03,735 --> 00:40:04,901
for all that destruction?

897
00:40:04,903 --> 00:40:06,770
He protects us.

898
00:40:06,772 --> 00:40:09,105
We all live under his care

899
00:40:09,107 --> 00:40:10,940
and his command.

900
00:40:10,942 --> 00:40:13,877
(Screeching, chattering)

901
00:40:13,879 --> 00:40:16,012
Valka: All but the babies,
of course...

902
00:40:16,014 --> 00:40:18,882
(Squawks)

903
00:40:18,884 --> 00:40:20,617
...who listen to no one.

904
00:40:20,619 --> 00:40:22,552
(Valka chuckles)

905
00:40:23,587 --> 00:40:25,555
Aw... (Laughs)

906
00:40:28,726 --> 00:40:30,693
(Deep grunting)

907
00:40:34,465 --> 00:40:36,533
I've lived among them
for 20 years, hiccup,

908
00:40:36,535 --> 00:40:39,135
discovering their secrets.

909
00:40:42,072 --> 00:40:44,674
(Laughs)
He likes you.

910
00:40:44,676 --> 00:40:46,176
Wow.

911
00:40:46,178 --> 00:40:47,710
You must be hungry.

912
00:40:47,712 --> 00:40:49,479
Uh, yeah, I could eat.

913
00:40:49,481 --> 00:40:50,480
Good.

914
00:40:50,482 --> 00:40:51,881
It's feeding time.

915
00:40:53,584 --> 00:40:55,552
(Deep grunting)

916
00:40:59,023 --> 00:41:00,557
(Screeches)

917
00:41:00,559 --> 00:41:02,625
I don't like it.

918
00:41:02,627 --> 00:41:04,761
They should've been back
with hiccup by now.

919
00:41:04,763 --> 00:41:05,929
I don't like it, either.

920
00:41:05,931 --> 00:41:07,030
(Splashing)
Eret, son of eret,

921
00:41:07,032 --> 00:41:08,798
was the man of my dreams.

922
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:10,200
My everything!

923
00:41:10,202 --> 00:41:12,669
But, baby,
I grew facial hair for you.

924
00:41:12,671 --> 00:41:14,604
Me, too.

925
00:41:14,606 --> 00:41:16,105
What if drago shot them down?

926
00:41:16,107 --> 00:41:18,808
What if they need our help?

927
00:41:18,810 --> 00:41:20,577
We have to find them.

928
00:41:20,579 --> 00:41:21,611
Wait, wait, what?

929
00:41:21,613 --> 00:41:22,779
No, but stoick said...

930
00:41:22,781 --> 00:41:24,013
It doesn't matter
what he said

931
00:41:24,015 --> 00:41:25,215
if they've all been captured.

932
00:41:25,217 --> 00:41:26,583
Come on!

933
00:41:26,585 --> 00:41:28,551
(Rumbling)

934
00:41:29,587 --> 00:41:31,688
No-name:
Do we go back?

935
00:41:31,690 --> 00:41:32,956
Eret:
We've nowhere to go,

936
00:41:32,958 --> 00:41:34,958
nothing to sell, and no heads

937
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:36,226
to call our own.

938
00:41:36,228 --> 00:41:37,861
Uh, eret...?
If we don't turn up

939
00:41:37,863 --> 00:41:40,230
with dragons and fast...

940
00:41:40,232 --> 00:41:41,764
(Screaming)

941
00:41:41,766 --> 00:41:43,766
Careful what you wish for!

942
00:41:43,768 --> 00:41:45,535
Do something!
Eret, son of eret!

943
00:41:45,537 --> 00:41:46,536
We'll miss you, eret!

944
00:41:46,538 --> 00:41:47,537
What is this?

945
00:41:47,539 --> 00:41:48,705
A kidnapping.

946
00:41:48,707 --> 00:41:50,240
Yay, can he ride with me?
Can he?

947
00:41:50,242 --> 00:41:51,541
(Fondly):
Can he...?

948
00:41:51,543 --> 00:41:52,909
(Groans)

949
00:41:52,911 --> 00:41:54,911
You're gonna show us
the way to drago.

950
00:41:54,913 --> 00:41:56,579
And help dragon riders

951
00:41:56,581 --> 00:41:58,081
sneak into drago's camp?

952
00:41:58,083 --> 00:41:59,148
Just kill me now.

953
00:41:59,150 --> 00:42:00,250
That could be arranged.

954
00:42:00,252 --> 00:42:01,918
Stormfly, drop it.

955
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:03,586
Huh? (Screaming)

956
00:42:04,588 --> 00:42:05,855
Good girl!

957
00:42:05,857 --> 00:42:08,892
(Screeches)
Stormfly, fetch.

958
00:42:08,894 --> 00:42:09,893
(Screaming)

959
00:42:09,895 --> 00:42:10,994
All right!

960
00:42:10,996 --> 00:42:13,963
Okay! I'll take you to drago!

961
00:42:13,965 --> 00:42:15,865
(Screaming)

962
00:42:15,867 --> 00:42:17,600
Works every time.

963
00:42:17,602 --> 00:42:18,768
(Eret mutters anxiously)

964
00:42:22,873 --> 00:42:25,775
(Dragons screeching)

965
00:42:25,777 --> 00:42:28,278
Hey, I-I thought
we were going to eat.

966
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:30,046
Oh, we are.

967
00:42:35,252 --> 00:42:37,287
(Rumbling)

968
00:42:37,289 --> 00:42:40,223
(Bellowing)

969
00:42:45,663 --> 00:42:46,863
(Gasps)

970
00:42:46,865 --> 00:42:48,698
(Laughs)

971
00:42:49,733 --> 00:42:51,034
(Screeching)

972
00:43:00,844 --> 00:43:04,113
And then, from dragon island,
I found this archipelago...

973
00:43:11,055 --> 00:43:12,922
There.

974
00:43:12,924 --> 00:43:15,658
(Sighs) Whoa.

975
00:43:15,660 --> 00:43:17,760
(Toothless bellows)

976
00:43:22,766 --> 00:43:25,234
(Chuckles)

977
00:43:29,873 --> 00:43:31,608
(Chitters)

978
00:43:31,610 --> 00:43:33,109
(Hiccup whoops)

979
00:43:33,111 --> 00:43:34,243
(Valka laughs)

980
00:43:43,187 --> 00:43:46,089

¶ ¶

983
00:44:05,142 --> 00:44:07,110
valka:
Oh, when I'm up here,

984
00:44:07,112 --> 00:44:08,978
I don't even feel the cold.

985
00:44:08,980 --> 00:44:10,346
I just feel...

986
00:44:10,348 --> 00:44:12,682
Free.

987
00:44:12,684 --> 00:44:13,983
(Sighs)

988
00:44:13,985 --> 00:44:15,418
(Laughs quietly)

989
00:44:15,420 --> 00:44:17,387
This is what it is

990
00:44:17,389 --> 00:44:20,657
to be a dragon, hiccup.

991
00:44:20,659 --> 00:44:22,725
It's all well and good

992
00:44:22,727 --> 00:44:23,960
to call yourself a dragon,

993
00:44:23,962 --> 00:44:25,194
but can you fly?

994
00:44:26,363 --> 00:44:27,664
(Gasps)

995
00:44:32,770 --> 00:44:34,337
(Grunts)

996
00:44:36,040 --> 00:44:38,207
(Laughter, whooping)

997
00:44:42,980 --> 00:44:44,881
(Whooping)

998
00:44:44,883 --> 00:44:46,783
(Yelling)
(Grumbles)

999
00:44:46,785 --> 00:44:48,251
Oh, no! Aah!

1000
00:44:52,289 --> 00:44:54,257
(Bellows, grunts, chatters)

1001
00:44:55,993 --> 00:44:57,760
(Hiccup laughs)

1002
00:44:57,762 --> 00:44:58,761
(Whooping)

1003
00:44:58,763 --> 00:45:00,430
Man, almost!

1004
00:45:00,432 --> 00:45:02,765
(Sneezes, shudders)
We just about
had it that time.

1005
00:45:02,767 --> 00:45:03,900
(Grumbles)

1006
00:45:03,902 --> 00:45:05,268
(Grunts)

1007
00:45:05,270 --> 00:45:06,736
(Chuckles)

1008
00:45:06,738 --> 00:45:08,037
(Panting)

1009
00:45:08,039 --> 00:45:09,305
Incredible.

1010
00:45:09,307 --> 00:45:11,741
Well, not bad yourself.

1011
00:45:22,252 --> 00:45:25,822
All this time,
you took after me.

1012
00:45:25,824 --> 00:45:27,724
And...

1013
00:45:27,726 --> 00:45:29,492
Where was I?

1014
00:45:30,728 --> 00:45:32,995
I'm so sorry, hiccup.

1015
00:45:32,997 --> 00:45:35,965
Can we start over?

1016
00:45:39,136 --> 00:45:41,904
Will you give me another chance?

1017
00:45:44,374 --> 00:45:46,909
I-I can teach you
all that I've learned

1018
00:45:46,911 --> 00:45:49,912
these past 20 years.

1019
00:45:49,914 --> 00:45:51,414
Like...
(Toothless bellows gently)

1020
00:45:55,886 --> 00:45:57,053
Wow.

1021
00:45:57,055 --> 00:45:59,322
Now you can make
those tight turns.

1022
00:45:59,324 --> 00:46:01,224
(Toothless grunting)

1023
00:46:01,226 --> 00:46:03,493
Did you know about this?

1024
00:46:03,495 --> 00:46:06,095
(Valka chuckles)
Every dragon

1025
00:46:06,097 --> 00:46:08,331
has its secrets. And...

1026
00:46:08,333 --> 00:46:10,366
I'll show them all to you.

1027
00:46:10,368 --> 00:46:12,902
We'll unlock every mystery,

1028
00:46:12,904 --> 00:46:15,972
find every last species--
together, as mother and son.

1029
00:46:15,974 --> 00:46:17,774
(Grunts)

1030
00:46:17,776 --> 00:46:20,843
(Valka and hiccup laugh)

1031
00:46:20,845 --> 00:46:22,545
(Toothless squeals)

1032
00:46:22,547 --> 00:46:24,981
This gift we share, hiccup,

1033
00:46:24,983 --> 00:46:26,983
it bonds us.

1034
00:46:26,985 --> 00:46:31,087
This is who you are, son.

1035
00:46:31,089 --> 00:46:32,855
Who we are.

1036
00:46:32,857 --> 00:46:36,492
We will change the world
for all dragons.

1037
00:46:36,494 --> 00:46:39,295
We will make it a better,
safer place.

1038
00:46:39,297 --> 00:46:40,897
Yeah, I mean,

1039
00:46:40,899 --> 00:46:43,332
that sounds amazing.

1040
00:46:44,935 --> 00:46:47,270
(Sighs)

1041
00:46:55,345 --> 00:46:57,380
Oh, this is so great!

1042
00:46:57,382 --> 00:47:00,583
Now you and I can go talk
to drago together.

1043
00:47:00,585 --> 00:47:02,051
(Chuckles):
What?

1044
00:47:02,053 --> 00:47:04,387
There's no talking to drago.

1045
00:47:04,389 --> 00:47:05,888
But we have to...
No.

1046
00:47:05,890 --> 00:47:08,157
We must protect our own.

1047
00:47:08,159 --> 00:47:09,258
(Scoffs)
Come on.

1048
00:47:09,260 --> 00:47:10,593
We should be getting back.

1049
00:47:10,595 --> 00:47:12,562
Hmm?

1050
00:47:15,199 --> 00:47:16,432
(Chitters)

1051
00:47:17,467 --> 00:47:19,902
(Dragons screech, bellow)

1052
00:47:21,138 --> 00:47:23,105
(Grunts)

1053
00:47:25,509 --> 00:47:27,877
Okay, I got you here!

1054
00:47:27,879 --> 00:47:29,212
Now get this thing off me.

1055
00:47:29,214 --> 00:47:31,013
Never take a toy from a dragon.

1056
00:47:31,015 --> 00:47:32,515
Don't you know anything?

1057
00:47:32,517 --> 00:47:33,983
(Eret groans)

1058
00:47:33,985 --> 00:47:36,419
Why does this
keep happening to me?

1059
00:47:41,191 --> 00:47:43,159
(Men shouting in distance)

1060
00:47:50,901 --> 00:47:52,368
What's down there?

1061
00:47:54,238 --> 00:47:55,504
Large diameter bubbles,

1062
00:47:55,506 --> 00:47:57,273
massive lungs,

1063
00:47:57,275 --> 00:47:59,508
cold water deep dweller,
I'm thinking

1064
00:47:59,510 --> 00:48:01,510
class five leviathan,

1065
00:48:01,512 --> 00:48:03,145
maybe six.

1066
00:48:03,147 --> 00:48:05,414
(Rumbling grunt)

1067
00:48:06,617 --> 00:48:08,484
(Dragon grunts)
Eret: Yah!

1068
00:48:10,254 --> 00:48:12,021

1069
00:48:14,958 --> 00:48:16,259
(Men shouting)

1070
00:48:17,995 --> 00:48:19,528
Meatlug, what's wrong, girl?
Hookfang!
Come on!

1071
00:48:19,530 --> 00:48:21,097
Don't move!

1072
00:48:21,099 --> 00:48:22,565
Uh...

1073
00:48:22,567 --> 00:48:24,533

(Grumbles)

1077
00:48:43,086 --> 00:48:45,021
Get off me!

1078
00:48:45,023 --> 00:48:46,289
(Laughs)

1079
00:48:46,291 --> 00:48:48,491
Always great
to see you, my friend.

1080
00:48:48,493 --> 00:48:50,626
Keeping warm up here?

1081
00:48:50,628 --> 00:48:52,595
(Deep bellow)

1082
00:48:54,164 --> 00:48:56,699
Well, as you can see,
I am right on time

1083
00:48:56,701 --> 00:48:58,634
with a new batch of dragons,

1084
00:48:58,636 --> 00:49:00,036
just like I promised.

1085
00:49:00,038 --> 00:49:01,637
He's waking up!
Drop the ropes!

1086
00:49:01,639 --> 00:49:03,205
Give me some backup here!

1087
00:49:03,207 --> 00:49:04,707
Watch out!

1088
00:49:04,709 --> 00:49:06,309
Drop the ropes.

1089
00:49:06,311 --> 00:49:07,977

(Inhales, growls)

1092
00:49:19,691 --> 00:49:22,258
(Eret laughs anxiously)

1093
00:49:22,260 --> 00:49:23,726
(Screeches)

1094
00:49:23,728 --> 00:49:27,029
(Yelling)

1095
00:49:32,102 --> 00:49:34,470
(Growling, hissing)

1096
00:49:34,472 --> 00:49:36,672
(Dragon whimpers)

1097
00:49:39,209 --> 00:49:41,077
Snotlout: Hookfang!
Ruffnut: Hey!

1098
00:49:41,079 --> 00:49:42,411
What are you doing?!

1099
00:49:42,413 --> 00:49:44,180
You belong

1100
00:49:44,182 --> 00:49:46,082
to me now.

1101
00:49:46,084 --> 00:49:47,350
(Men chuckling)

1102
00:49:47,352 --> 00:49:49,518
Eret:
And as an added bonus,

1103
00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:52,121
I also caught you
their riders.

1104
00:49:52,123 --> 00:49:54,123
No extra charge.
What?

1105
00:49:54,125 --> 00:49:55,558
Are you kidding me?
Aw!

1106
00:49:55,560 --> 00:49:57,660
But you were so perfect!

1107
00:49:57,662 --> 00:50:00,196
Turns out there's a whole bunch
of them out there.

1108
00:50:00,198 --> 00:50:02,031
(Drago growls)
They attacked... (Choking)

1109
00:50:02,033 --> 00:50:03,699
How many?

1110
00:50:03,701 --> 00:50:06,402
Drago doesn't have them
after all.

1111
00:50:06,404 --> 00:50:07,737
How many?
Astrid: Hundreds.

1112
00:50:07,739 --> 00:50:09,338
A whole island full.

1113
00:50:09,340 --> 00:50:11,374
I wouldn't worry about it.

1114
00:50:11,376 --> 00:50:14,643
(Strained): My men are
hunting them down as we speak.

1115
00:50:14,645 --> 00:50:16,345
They won't know
where you're hiding.

1116
00:50:16,347 --> 00:50:17,780
I promise you that.

1117
00:50:17,782 --> 00:50:20,049
Oh, yes, they will!
They know we're missing,

1118
00:50:20,051 --> 00:50:22,118
and they have
tracking dragons.

1119
00:50:22,120 --> 00:50:24,620
If you so much as touch us,
hiccup is gonna kick...

1120
00:50:24,622 --> 00:50:26,589
Hiccup?
He's not a problem.

1121
00:50:26,591 --> 00:50:28,657
Really, trust me.

1122
00:50:28,659 --> 00:50:31,060
He's only the son
of stoick the vast,

1123
00:50:31,062 --> 00:50:33,062
his heir to the
throne of berk,

1124
00:50:33,064 --> 00:50:36,565
and the greatest dragon master
this world has ever seen.

1125
00:50:36,567 --> 00:50:38,601
"Dragon master"?

1126
00:50:38,603 --> 00:50:40,669
I alone control

1127
00:50:40,671 --> 00:50:42,271
the dragons.

1128
00:50:42,273 --> 00:50:44,173
Nope, mm-mm.
Sorry!
(Chuckling)

1129
00:50:44,175 --> 00:50:47,510
And unless you let us go
right now,

1130
00:50:47,512 --> 00:50:50,046
he will blast through here
on his night fury

1131
00:50:50,048 --> 00:50:52,114
and blow your entire
fleet of ships

1132
00:50:52,116 --> 00:50:54,216
to splinters.

1133
00:50:54,218 --> 00:50:55,684
Then they'll be crying
like babies.

1134
00:50:55,686 --> 00:50:57,253
(Laughter)
Funny and beautiful.

1135
00:50:57,255 --> 00:50:58,587
Good one, babe.
Yeah.
(Groans)

1136
00:50:58,589 --> 00:51:01,290
Like babies,
they always cry.

1137
00:51:01,292 --> 00:51:02,491
Real tiny ones.

1138
00:51:02,493 --> 00:51:04,827
First there was one rider,

1139
00:51:04,829 --> 00:51:07,496
(coughing)
And now all of berk?

1140
00:51:07,498 --> 00:51:10,399
And you led them to me!

1141
00:51:10,401 --> 00:51:13,169
(Grunting)
Drago...!

1142
00:51:13,171 --> 00:51:16,172
Stop all preparations!

1143
00:51:16,174 --> 00:51:20,209
We must attack
the dragon riders' nest at once!

1144
00:51:20,211 --> 00:51:23,579
We will take down their Alpha.

1145
00:51:23,581 --> 00:51:27,483
Then we will take berk!

1146
00:51:27,485 --> 00:51:28,717
(Men cheering)

1147
00:51:28,719 --> 00:51:30,319
Drago!

1148
00:51:30,321 --> 00:51:31,520
And get rid of him.

1149
00:51:31,522 --> 00:51:34,590
(Chuckles)
Drago, please, I...

1150
00:51:34,592 --> 00:51:36,459
(Grunts)

1151
00:51:36,461 --> 00:51:38,727
(Gasping, men shouting)

1152
00:51:38,729 --> 00:51:40,129
(Screeching)

1153
00:51:40,131 --> 00:51:42,098
Astrid:
Stormfly!

1154
00:51:44,234 --> 00:51:45,401
(Drago growls)

1155
00:51:45,403 --> 00:51:47,269
No!

1156
00:51:51,475 --> 00:51:53,476
(Dragons screeching)

1157
00:51:53,478 --> 00:51:54,610
(Little dragons chittering)

1158
00:51:58,181 --> 00:52:00,316
Well, bud...

1159
00:52:00,318 --> 00:52:03,419
We can't wait around for drago
to attack this place.

1160
00:52:03,421 --> 00:52:05,354
We've got to find him first.

1161
00:52:05,356 --> 00:52:06,689
(Toothless growling)

1162
00:52:06,691 --> 00:52:08,724
(Roars)

1163
00:52:08,726 --> 00:52:10,726
(Little dragon chitters)

1164
00:52:10,728 --> 00:52:12,528
(Toothless growls)

1165
00:52:12,530 --> 00:52:13,596
Let's go.

1166
00:52:13,598 --> 00:52:14,663
(Gasps)

1167
00:52:14,665 --> 00:52:15,798
(Growls)

1168
00:52:15,800 --> 00:52:17,500
Easy now.

1169
00:52:17,502 --> 00:52:19,568
Are you kidding me?
How did you get in here?

1170
00:52:19,570 --> 00:52:21,137
The same way we're
getting you out.

1171
00:52:21,139 --> 00:52:22,838
"We"?
All clear.

1172
00:52:22,840 --> 00:52:24,306
Toothless, come.
Uh, wait, uh, wait...

1173
00:52:24,308 --> 00:52:26,475
Okay, uh, dad,
there-there's something

1174
00:52:26,477 --> 00:52:28,544
you need to know.
Yeah, yeah,
tell me on the way.

1175
00:52:28,546 --> 00:52:31,547
Well, this isn't an "on the way"
kind of update, actually.

1176
00:52:31,549 --> 00:52:32,748
I've heard enough, hiccup.

1177
00:52:32,750 --> 00:52:34,416
More-more of
the earth-shattering

1178
00:52:34,418 --> 00:52:35,584
development variety.

1179
00:52:35,586 --> 00:52:37,219
Yeah, just add it to pile.

1180
00:52:37,221 --> 00:52:38,821
Hiccup:
Yeah, I, uh, uh,

1181
00:52:38,823 --> 00:52:42,191
dad, unlike most surprises
I spring on you,

1182
00:52:42,193 --> 00:52:44,493
this is one you'll like,
I promise.

1183
00:52:44,495 --> 00:52:46,529
You just have to
handle it delicately.

1184
00:52:46,531 --> 00:52:48,497
So...

1185
00:52:48,499 --> 00:52:50,366
Uh...

1186
00:52:50,368 --> 00:52:53,536
You might want to take this one.

1187
00:52:53,538 --> 00:52:55,337
Huh?

1188
00:52:55,339 --> 00:52:56,939
Oh, boy.

1189
00:52:56,941 --> 00:52:59,708
Oh, uh, dad,

1190
00:52:59,710 --> 00:53:02,311
could you put
the sword away, please?

1191
00:53:02,313 --> 00:53:04,346
(Gasps)

1192
00:53:04,348 --> 00:53:06,448
Oh.

1193
00:53:08,652 --> 00:53:10,619
(Clattering)

1194
00:53:13,890 --> 00:53:17,660
I know what
you're gonna say, stoick.

1195
00:53:17,662 --> 00:53:19,929
How could I have done this?

1196
00:53:19,931 --> 00:53:21,397
(Sighs)

1197
00:53:21,399 --> 00:53:23,432
Stayed away all of these years,

1198
00:53:23,434 --> 00:53:25,501
and why didn't
I come back to you?

1199
00:53:25,503 --> 00:53:27,469
To our son?

1200
00:53:27,471 --> 00:53:28,737
Well...

1201
00:53:28,739 --> 00:53:30,673
What sign did I have

1202
00:53:30,675 --> 00:53:32,408
that you could change, stoick?

1203
00:53:32,410 --> 00:53:34,577
That anyone on berk could?

1204
00:53:34,579 --> 00:53:37,713
I pleaded so many times

1205
00:53:37,715 --> 00:53:39,715
to stop the fighting,
to find another answer,

1206
00:53:39,717 --> 00:53:41,517
but did any of you listen?

1207
00:53:41,519 --> 00:53:42,985
This is why I never married.

1208
00:53:42,987 --> 00:53:46,255
This, and one other reason.

1209
00:53:46,257 --> 00:53:48,457
I know that I left you

1210
00:53:48,459 --> 00:53:50,593
to raise hiccup alone,

1211
00:53:50,595 --> 00:53:53,629
but I thought he'd be
better off without me,

1212
00:53:53,631 --> 00:53:55,231
and I was wrong.

1213
00:53:55,233 --> 00:53:56,799
I see that now, but...

1214
00:53:56,801 --> 00:53:58,400
Oh!

1215
00:53:58,402 --> 00:54:01,270
Stop being so stoic, stoick.

1216
00:54:01,272 --> 00:54:03,639
Go on, shout, scream,

1217
00:54:03,641 --> 00:54:05,608
say something!

1218
00:54:09,746 --> 00:54:13,582
You're as beautiful
as the day I lost you.

1219
00:54:15,819 --> 00:54:17,786
(Sighs quietly)

1220
00:54:25,996 --> 00:54:27,963
¶ ¶

1221
00:54:30,900 --> 00:54:33,569
(dragons murmur)

1222
00:54:33,571 --> 00:54:35,571
(Sighs)

1223
00:54:35,573 --> 00:54:37,539
(Men shouting)

1224
00:54:40,043 --> 00:54:42,011
(Drago grunts)

1225
00:54:46,349 --> 00:54:47,683
Drago's man:
Move it.

1226
00:54:47,685 --> 00:54:48,717
Snotlout:
Could this day get any worse?

1227
00:54:48,719 --> 00:54:50,019
Tuffnut:
Uh, let me see.

1228
00:54:50,021 --> 00:54:51,487
We're gonna jump
into freezing cold water

1229
00:54:51,489 --> 00:54:53,055
and then die from drowning.

1230
00:54:53,057 --> 00:54:54,757
Eret:
Looks refreshing.

1231
00:54:54,759 --> 00:54:56,959
Please, ladies first.

1232
00:54:56,961 --> 00:55:00,462
You are a steaming heap

1233
00:55:00,464 --> 00:55:01,730
of dragon...
Duck.

1234
00:55:01,732 --> 00:55:02,731
(Grunting)

1235
00:55:05,935 --> 00:55:08,737
Warn the others!
Get them, you son of an eret.

1236
00:55:08,739 --> 00:55:10,372
(Grunting)

1237
00:55:10,374 --> 00:55:11,840
Tuffnut:
Take that!

1238
00:55:11,842 --> 00:55:13,709
(Yells)

1239
00:55:16,079 --> 00:55:18,847
(Groans, gasps)

1240
00:55:18,849 --> 00:55:20,382
Okay, I love you again.

1241
00:55:20,384 --> 00:55:22,418
(Sighs)
Oh, pathetic.

1242
00:55:22,420 --> 00:55:23,652
You can still jump.

1243
00:55:23,654 --> 00:55:25,421
So, are we going to save
your dragons

1244
00:55:25,423 --> 00:55:27,456
and get out of here
or not?
Mm.

1245
00:55:27,458 --> 00:55:28,957
Check every trap.

1246
00:55:28,959 --> 00:55:30,926
They're here somewhere.

1247
00:55:35,832 --> 00:55:38,834
(Groaning)

1248
00:55:39,869 --> 00:55:41,437
Meatlug?

1249
00:55:41,439 --> 00:55:42,705
(Groans)

1250
00:55:42,707 --> 00:55:44,640
Anyone coming?

1251
00:55:44,642 --> 00:55:46,508
I don't know, you just keep
doing what you're doing.

1252
00:55:46,510 --> 00:55:49,378
(Eret groans with effort)
Keep cranking.

1253
00:55:53,016 --> 00:55:55,451
(Grunts)

1254
00:55:55,453 --> 00:55:58,120
(Squawks)

1255
00:56:05,729 --> 00:56:08,964
Thank you for saving my life.

1256
00:56:08,966 --> 00:56:11,667
(Purrs)

1257
00:56:11,669 --> 00:56:13,135
(Sighs)

1258
00:56:13,137 --> 00:56:15,871
Now let me return the favor.

1259
00:56:15,873 --> 00:56:17,840
Mom, you'd never
even recognize it.

1260
00:56:17,842 --> 00:56:19,041
Where we used
to make weapons,

1261
00:56:19,043 --> 00:56:21,143
we now build saddles,

1262
00:56:21,145 --> 00:56:22,678
wing slings...

1263
00:56:22,680 --> 00:56:24,646
We-we even fix dragon teeth.
(Chattering)

1264
00:56:24,648 --> 00:56:27,082
You-you wouldn't believe
how much everything's changed.

1265
00:56:27,084 --> 00:56:29,385
Aye, your son's changed berk
for the better.

1266
00:56:29,387 --> 00:56:31,453
I think we did well
with this one, val.

1267
00:56:31,455 --> 00:56:32,621
Thanks, dad.
(Gasps)

1268
00:56:32,623 --> 00:56:33,722
(Grunting)

1269
00:56:33,724 --> 00:56:35,457
Stoick (Chuckling):
I got it.

1270
00:56:35,459 --> 00:56:36,592
I got it.
(Whimpers)

1271

1272
00:56:39,563 --> 00:56:41,530
(Gagging)

1273
00:56:45,902 --> 00:56:47,803
(Grunts happily)

1274
00:56:47,805 --> 00:56:49,438
I'm, uh...

1275
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:50,806
A little out of practice.

1276
00:56:50,808 --> 00:56:52,674
Well, you know,

1277
00:56:52,676 --> 00:56:54,410
I didn't marry you
for your cooking.

1278
00:56:54,412 --> 00:56:55,677
Gobber:
I hope not.

1279
00:56:55,679 --> 00:56:57,913
Her meatballs
could kill more beasts

1280
00:56:57,915 --> 00:56:59,681
than a battle ax.

1281
00:56:59,683 --> 00:57:02,184
I've still got a few knocking
around in here. (Laughs)

1282
00:57:02,186 --> 00:57:04,987
And once you move back in
with all your dragons,

1283
00:57:04,989 --> 00:57:07,456
old drago won't even
stand a chance.

1284
00:57:07,458 --> 00:57:08,891
Everything will be okay.

1285
00:57:08,893 --> 00:57:10,592
(Chuckles)
Slow down, son.

1286
00:57:10,594 --> 00:57:12,961
It's a lot to take in.

1287
00:57:12,963 --> 00:57:15,097
Hiccup:
Oh, gotcha.

1288
00:57:17,934 --> 00:57:19,902

a pleasant melody)

1289
00:57:22,806 --> 00:57:25,207
Oh, I love this one.

(Continues whistling)

1292
00:57:40,824 --> 00:57:42,791
Remember our song, val?

1293
00:57:44,194 --> 00:57:47,696
¶ I'll swim and sail ¶

1294
00:57:47,698 --> 00:57:51,834

¶ And love me for eternity ¶

1312
00:58:53,764 --> 00:58:55,731
¶ my darling dear ¶

1313

¶ but I've no need
of mighty deeds ¶

1316
00:59:03,173 --> 00:59:05,240
¶ when I feel
your arms around me ¶

1317
00:59:05,242 --> 00:59:06,842
(stoick laughs)

1318
00:59:06,844 --> 00:59:09,177
¶ But I would bring
you rings of gold ¶

1319
00:59:09,179 --> 00:59:11,680
¶ and even sing you poetry ¶
whoo!

1320
00:59:11,682 --> 00:59:13,282
Oh, would you?
¶ and I would keep you ¶

1321

¶ from all harm

1322
00:59:17,221 --> 00:59:20,055
valka: ¶ I have no use

¶ I care not for your poetry ¶

1324

to sweetly hold ¶

¶ for the dancing
and the dreaming ¶

1339
00:59:50,287 --> 00:59:53,288
I thought I'd have to die before
we'd have that dance again.

1340
00:59:53,290 --> 00:59:55,090
No need for drastic measures.

1341
00:59:55,092 --> 00:59:56,758
(Chuckles)

1342
00:59:56,760 --> 00:59:59,094
For you, my dear...

(Softly):
Anything.

1344
01:00:00,931 --> 01:00:03,899
Will you come home, val?

1345
01:00:05,234 --> 01:00:09,171
Will you be my
wife once again?

Thank odin you didn't
listen to me, son.

Val, it's all right,

We're a team now.

Now, what do you
want to do?

1373
01:01:10,334 --> 01:01:12,968
We have to save the dragons.

1374
01:01:12,970 --> 01:01:15,303
Aye, you got it.
Come on, son!

1375

Or maybe you need dragons
to conquer people...

01:14:14,551 --> 01:14:17,585
and lead you through
odin's great battlefield.

1636
01:14:17,587 --> 01:14:20,855
May they sing your name
with love and fury,

1637
01:14:20,857 --> 01:14:24,826
so that we might hear it rise
from the depths of Valhalla,

1638
01:14:24,828 --> 01:14:27,695
and know that you've taken
your rightful place

1639

1641
01:14:33,870 --> 01:14:35,503
A warrior.

1642
01:14:36,605 --> 01:14:38,606

1643
01:14:38,608 --> 01:14:40,541

I'm not the chief that...

1654

You wanted me to be.

1655
01:15:36,232 --> 01:15:39,800
And I'm not the peacekeeper
I thought I was.

(Sighs)

1658
01:15:57,185 --> 01:16:00,187
You came early
into this world.

1659
01:16:00,189 --> 01:16:02,823
You were such a wee thing.

1660
01:16:02,825 --> 01:16:06,327
Oh, so frail, so fragile.

1661
01:16:06,329 --> 01:16:08,896
I feared you
wouldn't make it.

1662
01:16:10,699 --> 01:16:13,267
But your father...

1663
01:16:13,269 --> 01:16:16,070
He never doubted.

1664
01:16:16,072 --> 01:16:20,341
He always said you'd become
the strongest of them all.

1665
01:16:20,343 --> 01:16:22,643
And he was right.

1666
01:16:23,879 --> 01:16:26,814
You have the heart
of a chief,

1667
01:16:26,816 --> 01:16:29,250
and the soul
of a dragon.

1668

Only you can bring
our worlds together.

Mostly because
I thought I never could.

I guess you can only try.

They don't listen to anyone.

this is poorly conceived!

Heads up!
