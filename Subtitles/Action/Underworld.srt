I even took a Vampire for my bride.

708
01:37:30,594 --> 01:37:32,595
It was forbidden...

01:37:32,847 --> 01:37:35,098

our union.

710
01:37:35,266 --> 01:37:40,228
Viktor feared
a blending of the species.

711
01:37:42,022 --> 01:37:44,315
Feared it so much...

712
01:37:45,442 --> 01:37:47,485
he killed her.

713
01:37:48,571 --> 01:37:50,780

718
01:38:08,007 --> 01:38:11,175
and he's spent
the last 600 years

719
01:38:11,927 --> 01:38:15,096
exterminating my species.

when the spoils are tabulated.

How do you expect me
to assume control now
that Viktor's been awakened?

732
01:39:19,328 --> 01:39:22,872
There's no defeating him.
He grows stronger as we speak.

733

I need Michael.

about your beloved dark father.

He's the one who killed your family.
