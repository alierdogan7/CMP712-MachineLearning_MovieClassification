Intel indicates she will check into
the Burj Hotel in Dubai in 36 hours.

537
00:49:06,191 --> 00:49:08,594
Marius Wistrom is a known
operative of Cobalt.

538
00:49:08,661 --> 00:49:10,812
Wistrom is currently
en route to Dubai.

539
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:14,633
For the launch device to work,
Cobalt needs the activation codes.

540
00:49:14,684 --> 00:49:17,519
He's sending Wistrom
to buy them from Moreau.

541

The Secretary

542
00:49:21,574 --> 00:49:23,008

544
00:49:31,651 --> 00:49:33,284
We're shut down.

545
00:49:33,352 --> 00:49:37,355
No satellite, safe house, support,
or extraction.

546
00:49:37,423 --> 00:49:40,625
The four of us and the contents of this car

547
00:49:40,693 --> 00:49:43,361
are all that remain
of the IMF.

548
00:49:43,429 --> 00:49:47,799
And as of this moment,
any action is unsanctioned. So if you want out,

549
00:49:47,867 --> 00:49:49,200
speak now.

550
00:50:05,735 --> 00:50:07,202
Our mission
is Hendricks.

551
00:50:07,270 --> 00:50:09,204
We're all that stands
between him and his goal.

552
00:50:09,272 --> 00:50:10,738
Nothing can be
left to chance.

553
00:50:10,806 --> 00:50:12,757
Everyone connected
with this man

554
00:50:12,825 --> 00:50:16,161
is considered an asset with valuable
information about our target.

555
00:50:16,229 --> 00:50:17,496
No one can know
we're still on line.

556
00:50:17,563 --> 00:50:19,898
We lose Hendricks now,
we lose him forever.

557
00:50:19,966 --> 00:50:21,816
So, what's the play?

558
00:50:21,884 --> 00:50:24,269
Wistrom will take delivery from Moreau in 36 hours.

559
00:50:24,337 --> 00:50:26,505
Now we cannot let the launch codes leave the hotel,

560
00:50:26,572 --> 00:50:29,474
but we need Wistrom
to lead us to Hendricks.

561
00:50:29,542 --> 00:50:31,826
He'll only do that
if he has the codes.

562
00:50:31,894 --> 00:50:33,178
JANE: Or if he thinks
he has them.

563
00:50:33,246 --> 00:50:35,480
Our objective is to
intercept the sale,

564
00:50:35,548 --> 00:50:37,832
replace the authentic
codes with counterfeits

565
00:50:37,901 --> 00:50:39,667
and follow Wistrom
to Hendricks.

566
00:50:39,735 --> 00:50:43,438
Well, that's simple enough.
We snatch the codes, we gin up some fakes.

567
00:50:43,506 --> 00:50:48,343
Jane, you double Moreau,
and sell the codes to Wistrom and Bob's your uncle.

568
00:50:48,410 --> 00:50:51,680
And how do you propose we just
snatch the codes from Moreau?

569
00:50:51,748 --> 00:50:53,015
We take her out.

570
00:50:54,900 --> 00:50:57,952
Yeah, we take her out.
But, you know, discreetly.

571
00:50:58,020 --> 00:50:59,137
Discreetly?

572
00:50:59,539 --> 00:51:01,656
Yeah.

573
00:51:01,724 --> 00:51:05,127
Right, she's an asset. Right. I get it.

BENJI: All right.

576
00:51:09,499 --> 00:51:10,699
Or Moreau.

577
00:51:12,851 --> 00:51:15,953
She'll answer for Hanaway,
but it has to be when I say.

double Wistrom and Moreau,

583
00:51:58,731 --> 00:52:00,966
how do we keep them
in separate rooms

584
00:52:01,033 --> 00:52:03,835

they're in the same room?

ETHAN: We give
the hotel a facelift.

586
00:52:05,888 --> 00:52:08,656
Wistrom will think he's arriving at Moreau's suite,

587
00:52:08,724 --> 00:52:11,159
but, really, he'll be
walking into our decoy room.

588
00:52:11,227 --> 00:52:12,960
Where I'll double Moreau.

would be a cinch

if I could call Youssef
back at headquarters,

617

and neither do we.

my cousin is between you and him.

1064

You want something
from me, you pay.

1065
01:29:24,273 --> 01:29:29,193

I'm not buying. I'm selling.

I'm looking for a man
named Kurt Hendricks.

1075
01:29:56,555 --> 01:29:58,189
You may know him
as Cobalt.

1076
01:29:58,257 --> 01:30:01,025
In either case,
I think you know what he wants.

1077
01:30:01,093 --> 01:30:03,928
I'll bet he even tried to buy it from you at some point.

1078
01:30:05,164 --> 01:30:06,231
Go on.

1079
01:30:06,298 --> 01:30:09,067
He has a case,
he has codes.

1080
01:30:09,134 --> 01:30:12,436
But they're worthless
without a tactical satellite.

1081
01:30:12,504 --> 01:30:15,439
I want to know
where he'd get it.

1082
01:30:15,507 --> 01:30:19,244
A man with information like that
would be a potential terrorist.

1083
01:30:19,995 --> 01:30:21,963
And to your government,

1084

is a terrorist.

1088

I cannot help you.

1089
01:30:47,172 --> 01:30:50,241
I certainly cannot tell you
that Russia quietly sold

1090
01:30:50,309 --> 01:30:54,128
an obsolete tactical satellite to
a certain telecom in Mumbai.

1091
01:30:55,965 --> 01:30:58,099
And whoever gave
them that idea?

1092
01:30:58,167 --> 01:31:01,903

be shut down?

1096
01:31:09,027 --> 01:31:10,961
That would take
special skills,

1097
01:31:11,647 --> 01:31:13,280
and you cannot
do it alone.

we could help.

1103
01:31:48,167 --> 01:31:50,100

do it together.

are we going?

to find you.

the object was some sort of aircraft,

visible during daylight.

had people in Rankow.

was the ideal cover.

never told me.

she was still alive.
