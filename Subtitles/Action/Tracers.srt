1
00:01:20,314 --> 00:01:21,613
Lafayette Courier.

2
00:01:21,615 --> 00:01:23,482
Got 'er. Thank you.

3
00:01:23,484 --> 00:01:24,650
Bye-bye.

4
00:01:28,655 --> 00:01:30,189
Cam!

5
00:01:30,191 --> 00:01:31,490
Have you seen Cam?

6
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:42,568
Cam!
Where in the hell is he?

7
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:44,203
Cam, where you at, buddy?

8
00:01:44,205 --> 00:01:45,671
Damn!

9
00:01:45,673 --> 00:01:49,141
Cam!
Uptown express, okay!

10
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:05,350
- Unh!

11
00:03:15,428 --> 00:03:16,495
Are you okay?

12
00:03:16,497 --> 00:03:17,863
Yeah. I'm fine.

13
00:03:22,569 --> 00:03:24,836
Hey, you!
Come back here.

14
00:03:24,838 --> 00:03:26,672
Sorry about your bike.

15
00:03:28,474 --> 00:03:31,577
Come back here!

16
00:03:45,526 --> 00:03:47,759
Cam.

17
00:03:49,295 --> 00:03:50,429
Cam.

18
00:03:51,598 --> 00:03:53,599
You want
your check or not?

19
00:03:53,601 --> 00:03:54,881
Sorry.

20
00:03:59,806 --> 00:04:02,407
Lonnie,
I need more runs.

21
00:04:02,409 --> 00:04:03,742
Cam, I'm happy
to help you out,

22
00:04:03,744 --> 00:04:05,877
but you need
a bike first, man.

23
00:04:08,314 --> 00:04:09,915
Got a friend
that can loan you one?

24
00:04:13,286 --> 00:04:16,555
Hey, uh...

25
00:04:16,557 --> 00:04:17,789
keep your head up.

26
00:04:26,733 --> 00:04:28,033
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

27
00:04:28,035 --> 00:04:29,568
- Hey!
- What?

28
00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:30,702
Where you been hiding?

29
00:04:36,876 --> 00:04:38,043
Whatcha got there, Cam?

30
00:04:38,045 --> 00:04:39,745
- Nothing.
- Nothing?

31
00:04:41,881 --> 00:04:44,416
Okay, so what?
You forget about us or what?

32
00:04:44,418 --> 00:04:45,751
No, no, no, I didn't...
I didn't forget.

33
00:04:45,753 --> 00:04:48,320
I just...
I didn't have it.
I just got that.

34
00:04:48,322 --> 00:04:51,056
Okay. Well,
what else you got?

35
00:04:51,058 --> 00:04:53,358
- Come on.
- Come on, man.

36
00:04:55,895 --> 00:04:57,062
Are you serious?

37
00:04:58,698 --> 00:04:59,978
I am serious.

38
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:09,574
- What is that, $9.00?
- Yeah, $9.00, probably.

39
00:05:09,576 --> 00:05:12,296
- Where's all your
money going, man?
- To you guys!

40
00:05:13,514 --> 00:05:15,981
You came to us
for a loan, right, Cam?

41
00:05:15,983 --> 00:05:18,884
You accepted our terms.
1500.

42
00:05:18,886 --> 00:05:20,852
On the first
of each month, every month.

43
00:05:20,854 --> 00:05:22,754
I know. I know.

44
00:05:22,756 --> 00:05:24,656
I-I-I'm sorry.

45
00:05:24,658 --> 00:05:26,425
I... I'm sorry
I missed a payment.
It won't happen again.

46
00:05:26,427 --> 00:05:28,593
No, it won't.

47
00:05:28,595 --> 00:05:30,362
Now. Sign this please.

48
00:05:30,364 --> 00:05:32,664
Jerry,
I owe somebody rent.
Don't you wanna...

49
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:35,000
And what, you think
I'm doing this for fun?

50
00:05:35,002 --> 00:05:37,803
- No, I c...
- This is my job, Cam, okay?

51
00:05:37,805 --> 00:05:40,672
I got a boss
just like you got a boss.

52
00:05:40,674 --> 00:05:42,808
Now just sign it, okay?

53
00:05:45,078 --> 00:05:47,646
This is the second time
you've been late.

54
00:05:47,648 --> 00:05:50,849
And, uh,
that makes us, um...

55
00:05:50,851 --> 00:05:52,751
- What's that make us?
- Nervous.

56
00:05:52,753 --> 00:05:54,453
- Nervous. See?
- Yeah.

57
00:05:54,455 --> 00:05:55,620
Hu is nervous.

58
00:05:55,622 --> 00:05:58,890
So, you owe us $15,000.

59
00:05:58,892 --> 00:06:02,027
And just don't miss
another payment.

60
00:06:02,029 --> 00:06:03,562
I won't.

61
00:06:10,636 --> 00:06:12,637
Don't miss another payment.

62
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:13,939
I know.

63
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,467
- You good, buddy?
- Yeah.

64
00:07:15,469 --> 00:07:16,768
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

65
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:17,903
- You all right?
- Yeah, I'm good.

66
00:07:17,905 --> 00:07:18,905
Okay.

67
00:07:20,072 --> 00:07:21,740
Where's your bike?

68
00:07:21,742 --> 00:07:24,042
I, uh,
I hit a pothole.

69
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:29,014
It looks like you got
bigger problems.

70
00:07:29,016 --> 00:07:30,296
Let's get in here.

71
00:07:34,153 --> 00:07:36,888
All right.

72
00:07:36,890 --> 00:07:38,130
When are we gonna go
for a ride?

73
00:07:39,792 --> 00:07:41,092
Car's still broken, buddy.

74
00:07:41,094 --> 00:07:44,229
I haven't had time
to work on it.

75
00:07:44,231 --> 00:07:48,800
And I don't have the money
or the parts I need.

76
00:07:48,802 --> 00:07:50,769
Maybe you ought
to sell it.

77
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:55,507
Yeah, maybe.

78
00:07:55,509 --> 00:07:56,741
Joey?

79
00:07:56,743 --> 00:07:58,844
All right,
you're good to go.

80
00:07:58,846 --> 00:08:00,512
Thanks a lot, Cam.

81
00:08:00,514 --> 00:08:02,013
You're welcome.

82
00:08:02,015 --> 00:08:04,095
I told you to give Cam
his space.

83
00:08:05,184 --> 00:08:07,152
Chill-lax, Mom.
It's all gravy.

84
00:08:07,154 --> 00:08:08,820
Chill-lax?

85
00:08:08,822 --> 00:08:09,988
Sorry about that.

86
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:12,090
Don't worry about it.
He's a good kid.

87
00:08:13,626 --> 00:08:14,893
Hey, Ang.

88
00:08:14,895 --> 00:08:18,029
Can I talk to you
for a second?

89
00:08:18,031 --> 00:08:20,031
I'm gonna be a little late
on the rent this month.

90
00:08:20,033 --> 00:08:22,701
I'm sorry.
I'll get it to you
as soon as I can.

91
00:08:22,703 --> 00:08:26,137
I know you're good for it,
but I'm having a tough month.

92
00:08:26,139 --> 00:08:27,539
Try your best,
please, Cam?

93
00:08:27,541 --> 00:08:30,108
I know. I will.

94
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:31,576
Thank you.

95
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:13,278
Yeah?

96
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:14,913
You coming
in today or not?

97
00:10:17,149 --> 00:10:19,818
What are you...
what are you talking about?
Do you not remember?

98
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:21,886
What do you want me
to do with your new bike, then?

99
00:10:23,756 --> 00:10:25,824
What new bike?

100
00:10:25,826 --> 00:10:28,186
The one
your girlfriend dropped off
for you this morning.

101
00:10:38,938 --> 00:10:40,739
I don't have a girlfriend.

102
00:12:10,831 --> 00:12:12,311
- Hey!
- What do you want?

103
00:12:14,867 --> 00:12:16,501
To... to say thank you.

104
00:12:16,503 --> 00:12:18,203
- For what?
- What do you mean for what?

105
00:12:18,205 --> 00:12:20,238
For the bike you got me.

106
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,473
You're welcome.

107
00:12:21,475 --> 00:12:24,042
Do you, uh...

108
00:12:24,044 --> 00:12:26,177
How did you learn
how to do parkour?

109
00:12:28,414 --> 00:12:30,014
What, did I say it wrong?

110
00:12:34,954 --> 00:12:36,714
- I gotta go.
- Wait, what's your name?

111
00:12:40,459 --> 00:12:41,860
Do you ride?

112
00:12:41,862 --> 00:12:44,829
No. A bike's a ball
and chain.

113
00:12:44,831 --> 00:12:46,231
Oh, yeah?

114
00:12:46,233 --> 00:12:47,932
All right.

115
00:12:47,934 --> 00:12:49,934
Well, you know,
anybody can...

116
00:12:49,936 --> 00:12:53,538
hop up and climb this thing.

117
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:55,440
I'd like to see that.

118
00:12:59,145 --> 00:13:00,445
All right.

119
00:13:00,447 --> 00:13:01,913
You got it.

120
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:18,196
Maybe you should stick
to the bike.

121
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:21,933
Screw it.

122
00:13:28,207 --> 00:13:30,208
I'm Cam.

123
00:13:30,210 --> 00:13:31,576
Nikki.

124
00:13:33,846 --> 00:13:36,246
You want to show me
something else?

125
00:14:05,912 --> 00:14:06,945
Unh.

126
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:09,314
Ugh.

127
00:14:11,517 --> 00:14:13,184
You gotta learn how to see.

128
00:14:13,186 --> 00:14:15,920
I can see just fine.

129
00:14:15,922 --> 00:14:17,522
If you want to vault the car,
don't look at the car,

130
00:14:17,524 --> 00:14:19,157
look where the car isn't.

131
00:14:19,159 --> 00:14:21,392
Okay.

132
00:14:35,975 --> 00:14:38,142
Whoa, hey!
How did you get over there?

133
00:14:38,144 --> 00:14:40,445
Nice to meet you, Cam.

134
00:14:40,447 --> 00:14:41,980
Who are you?

135
00:14:48,988 --> 00:14:50,121
What are you doing here,
Dylan?

136
00:14:50,123 --> 00:14:52,290
I'm just looking out for you,
Nicks.

137
00:14:52,292 --> 00:14:54,592
So what, you're just
spying on me the whole time?

138
00:14:54,594 --> 00:14:57,428
- You working out alone?
- So what?

139
00:14:57,430 --> 00:14:59,564
So you gotta be careful.
That's all I'm saying.

140
00:14:59,566 --> 00:15:01,332
You gotta stay off my ass,
Dyl.

141
00:15:01,334 --> 00:15:02,934
Who is this guy?

142
00:15:04,403 --> 00:15:06,404
He's nobody.

143
00:15:06,406 --> 00:15:08,573
Haven't seen you
around.

144
00:15:08,575 --> 00:15:10,108
I haven't been around.

145
00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:11,242
Where'd you find him?

146
00:15:11,244 --> 00:15:13,411
He found me.

147
00:15:13,413 --> 00:15:17,081
- You following her?
- No, no.

148
00:15:17,083 --> 00:15:18,683
Just saw her in the park.

149
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:26,624
You know
this is dangerous stuff.

150
00:15:26,626 --> 00:15:28,993
You get hurt
if you don't know
what you're doing.

151
00:15:33,565 --> 00:15:34,966
Let's bounce.

152
00:15:53,319 --> 00:15:54,485
Wonderful.

153
00:16:06,566 --> 00:16:09,367
Well, some of this stuff
is kinda beat up,

154
00:16:09,369 --> 00:16:11,269
but uh...

155
00:16:11,271 --> 00:16:13,571
I'll give you 450.

156
00:16:18,344 --> 00:16:20,678
Look, my rent's $550.
Can you go there?

157
00:16:24,717 --> 00:16:29,153
One, two, three,
four, five, fifty.

158
00:16:29,155 --> 00:16:30,455
Thanks.

159
00:16:32,091 --> 00:16:33,371
Thanks a lot.

160
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,240
How much for
the muscle car, kid?

161
00:16:46,171 --> 00:16:49,173
It was my Dad's.

162
00:16:49,175 --> 00:16:51,009
I'm gonna have to hold onto it.

163
00:16:51,011 --> 00:16:52,643
Too bad, nice car.

164
00:17:16,335 --> 00:17:18,569
Hey, Cam!
You saw that, mom?

165
00:17:18,571 --> 00:17:20,251
Yeah, I did, baby.
Come on...

166
00:17:21,473 --> 00:17:22,807
Hey, Joey!

167
00:17:36,355 --> 00:17:38,156
It's not much to look at,

168
00:17:38,158 --> 00:17:39,490
but... Okay.

169
00:17:39,492 --> 00:17:41,059
Better watch the potholes
this time, all right?

170
00:17:41,061 --> 00:17:42,393
Hey, buddy.

171
00:19:22,361 --> 00:19:24,829
Looks like
somebody's been
practicing.

172
00:19:24,831 --> 00:19:26,697
You should come work out
with us.

173
00:19:26,699 --> 00:19:28,199
I never see you
guys around.

174
00:19:28,201 --> 00:19:29,767
We're a tight group.

175
00:19:29,769 --> 00:19:30,902
We like to keep
to ourselves.

176
00:19:32,704 --> 00:19:34,372
Loujaine floating
terminal in Brooklyn.

177
00:19:34,374 --> 00:19:36,374
- You know it?
- No.

178
00:19:36,376 --> 00:19:38,843
Pier 62. Gowanus Bay.

179
00:19:38,845 --> 00:19:40,511
I'll see you at dawn.

180
00:19:40,513 --> 00:19:41,846
All right.

181
00:20:07,372 --> 00:20:08,706
Hey, guys.

182
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:13,511
I'm Dylan.

183
00:20:13,513 --> 00:20:15,546
This is Tate, Jax.

184
00:20:15,548 --> 00:20:16,681
- How's it going?
- Cam.

185
00:20:16,683 --> 00:20:17,982
What's up?

186
00:20:17,984 --> 00:20:19,483
This is my sister Nikki.

187
00:20:19,485 --> 00:20:20,818
We already met.

188
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:39,370
This is awesome.

189
00:20:41,373 --> 00:20:42,533
What are we supposed to do?

190
00:20:46,745 --> 00:20:47,878
Try and keep up.

191
00:22:15,401 --> 00:22:17,201
Holy shit!
He's dead, dude.

192
00:22:28,513 --> 00:22:30,514
Hey, there.

193
00:22:30,516 --> 00:22:32,350
You must be Cam.

194
00:22:32,352 --> 00:22:35,386
Dylan tells me
you're new to parkour.

195
00:22:35,388 --> 00:22:37,555
He also said
you're pretty good.

196
00:22:37,557 --> 00:22:39,623
Might have to, uh,
work on this jump though.

197
00:22:42,427 --> 00:22:43,427
I'm Miller.

198
00:22:51,570 --> 00:22:53,404
Pick a fight with gravity
before you're ready,

199
00:22:53,406 --> 00:22:54,739
you tend to get a beating.

200
00:22:54,741 --> 00:22:57,181
I don't know
what I'm doing.

201
00:22:58,144 --> 00:23:00,111
That's the great thing
about parkour, my friend.

202
00:23:00,113 --> 00:23:01,645
There are no rules.

203
00:23:01,647 --> 00:23:04,515
- You all right?
- I'm good.

204
00:23:04,517 --> 00:23:05,649
Just trying to keep up.

205
00:23:13,892 --> 00:23:15,893
Cam.
Is that short for Camaro?

206
00:23:15,895 --> 00:23:17,094
Shut... You have
a learning disability, dude.

207
00:23:17,096 --> 00:23:18,763
Excuse him.

208
00:23:18,765 --> 00:23:21,098
- Where you from?
- Queens.

209
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:22,633
Play any sports
in high school?

210
00:23:22,635 --> 00:23:23,768
Nah, I barely went.

211
00:23:23,770 --> 00:23:25,936
I tried baseball once,

212
00:23:25,938 --> 00:23:29,440
Yeah, I wasn't much of a jock
in high school either.

213
00:23:29,442 --> 00:23:30,941
Look at you.
Hello.

214
00:23:30,943 --> 00:23:32,777
Where'd you do your time?

215
00:23:35,181 --> 00:23:38,716
You're not
the only one in here
with a record.

216
00:23:40,886 --> 00:23:42,453
Abbot House.
Hillside.

217
00:23:42,455 --> 00:23:43,521
Juvi.

218
00:23:45,023 --> 00:23:46,524
Yeah.

219
00:23:46,526 --> 00:23:48,659
Did six months in Otisville
a couple years ago.

220
00:23:48,661 --> 00:23:50,161
Oh shit, what for?

221
00:23:50,163 --> 00:23:52,496
B & E. Boosting cars.

222
00:23:52,498 --> 00:23:53,998
Just bullshit stuff.

223
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,600
You ever go in hard?
Pull some hold ups?

224
00:23:56,602 --> 00:24:00,104
No. I didn't want
to go that way.

225
00:24:00,106 --> 00:24:01,539
Right.

226
00:24:01,541 --> 00:24:02,873
So, what'd you do for money?

227
00:24:04,876 --> 00:24:06,744
I'm a bike messenger.

228
00:24:06,746 --> 00:24:09,547
Fifty points
for the bike messenger.

229
00:24:09,549 --> 00:24:11,982
What do you guys deliver?

230
00:24:11,984 --> 00:24:15,519
Documents.
Just business stuff.

231
00:24:15,521 --> 00:24:17,988
At least,
that's what they tell you.

232
00:24:17,990 --> 00:24:19,557
I don't know.

233
00:24:19,559 --> 00:24:21,025
I mean,
they hand me a package,
I drop it off.

234
00:24:21,027 --> 00:24:22,159
Sure, but it could be
anything, right?

235
00:24:22,161 --> 00:24:23,694
I guess.

236
00:24:23,696 --> 00:24:26,664
You never look
inside the bag?

237
00:24:26,666 --> 00:24:28,199
No.

238
00:24:28,201 --> 00:24:29,201
Never?

239
00:24:31,870 --> 00:24:33,571
No. Why would I do that?

240
00:24:33,573 --> 00:24:36,240
Just curiosity.

241
00:24:36,242 --> 00:24:38,108
It's none of my business.

242
00:24:38,110 --> 00:24:40,070
But you're the one
carrying the package.

243
00:24:43,248 --> 00:24:46,217
Look, as long as
after I drop it off
they pay me my money,

244
00:24:46,219 --> 00:24:48,659
I don't really care
what's inside the bag.

245
00:24:54,226 --> 00:24:57,094
- So what do you guys do?

246
00:24:57,096 --> 00:24:59,056
We do whatever we can
not to get caught.

247
00:25:08,206 --> 00:25:10,841
Heh.
That looks like fun.

248
00:25:10,843 --> 00:25:12,710
They are no limits, my friend.

249
00:25:12,712 --> 00:25:15,713
- Only plateaus.
- Plateaus?

250
00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:19,517
You've got
to constantly push past

251
00:25:19,519 --> 00:25:22,786
what you think you can do
or you stay stuck.

252
00:25:22,788 --> 00:25:25,589
Hmm. I like that one.

253
00:25:25,591 --> 00:25:27,925
What else you got?

254
00:25:27,927 --> 00:25:30,160
Well, how about this?
This whole thing,

255
00:25:30,162 --> 00:25:32,596
parkour, free running, tracing...
whatever you want to call it,

256
00:25:32,598 --> 00:25:34,965
is just a state of mind.

257
00:25:34,967 --> 00:25:37,101
Now the real obstacles
are not out there.

258
00:25:37,103 --> 00:25:38,235
They're in your head.

259
00:25:38,237 --> 00:25:41,105
Okay?

260
00:25:41,107 --> 00:25:43,974
I don't know.
Those obstacles look
pretty real to me.

261
00:25:43,976 --> 00:25:46,176
Well, you're gonna have to start
seeing 'em differently.

262
00:25:48,213 --> 00:25:50,748
Hmm. Got it.

263
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:53,250
So look where the car isn't.

264
00:25:53,252 --> 00:25:54,785
Exactly.

265
00:25:58,223 --> 00:26:00,624
So, uh, how's that new bike
treating you?

266
00:26:00,626 --> 00:26:02,159
It's good.
Thanks again.

267
00:26:02,161 --> 00:26:03,694
Where is it?

268
00:26:03,696 --> 00:26:05,129
I, uh,
left it at home today.

269
00:26:05,131 --> 00:26:06,330
Liar.

270
00:26:06,332 --> 00:26:08,699
Somebody clipped it.

271
00:26:08,701 --> 00:26:10,834
I didn't want to say anything.

272
00:26:10,836 --> 00:26:12,169
It's all good.
I get it.

273
00:26:12,171 --> 00:26:13,704
You're one of those kind
of people.

274
00:26:13,706 --> 00:26:16,607
What kind of people
is that?

275
00:26:16,609 --> 00:26:19,677
Can't hang on
to anything nice.

276
00:26:21,646 --> 00:26:23,280
I guess I haven't had
enough practice.

277
00:26:23,282 --> 00:26:25,082
Don't worry about it.

278
00:26:25,084 --> 00:26:26,684
I should've known better.

279
00:26:26,686 --> 00:26:28,118
I mean...

280
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:29,887
Next time
I'll just take my wallet
and burn it.

281
00:26:29,889 --> 00:26:32,957
Hey, Niks! Let's go!

282
00:26:32,959 --> 00:26:34,758
You guys all work together?

283
00:26:37,896 --> 00:26:40,230
See you around, Cam.

284
00:26:40,232 --> 00:26:41,932
Good to meet you, Cam.

285
00:26:41,934 --> 00:26:43,974
Don't let these guys
get you in trouble.

286
00:26:59,117 --> 00:27:00,317
Oh, shit!

287
00:27:06,224 --> 00:27:08,726
Excuse me,
is-is Jerry here?

288
00:27:08,728 --> 00:27:10,194
Jerry?

289
00:27:10,196 --> 00:27:11,996
Back there?

290
00:27:11,998 --> 00:27:13,130
Okay.

291
00:27:23,241 --> 00:27:25,042
Excuse me, Sir.
Is Jerry here?

292
00:27:25,044 --> 00:27:26,377
You just missed him.

293
00:27:26,379 --> 00:27:27,378
Do you know
when he'll be back?

294
00:27:27,380 --> 00:27:29,213
When he returns.

295
00:27:29,215 --> 00:27:30,314
Okay.

296
00:27:43,161 --> 00:27:44,695
Hey!

297
00:27:44,697 --> 00:27:46,997
- Hey, what are you doing?
- Hey, Cam.

298
00:27:46,999 --> 00:27:48,966
You didn't tell us
you had such a sweet ride, man.

299
00:27:48,968 --> 00:27:50,234
I have your cash,
right here!

300
00:27:50,236 --> 00:27:52,369
Here.

301
00:27:52,371 --> 00:27:54,138
- There you go, take it.
- All right, man.

302
00:27:54,140 --> 00:27:56,407
We're taking five grand
off your tab for the car,

303
00:27:56,409 --> 00:27:58,676
but you got one month
to get us the rest, all right?

304
00:27:58,678 --> 00:28:00,878
How am I supposed to get
10 grand in a month, Jerry?!

305
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:02,279
Not my problem, Cam.

306
00:28:02,281 --> 00:28:04,782
Jerry, cut me some slack,
come on.

307
00:28:08,286 --> 00:28:11,455
You still don't understand
how this works, do you?

308
00:28:11,457 --> 00:28:13,190
If you don't pay,
we don't shoot you.

309
00:28:18,096 --> 00:28:19,963
You got one month, Cam.

310
00:28:32,410 --> 00:28:33,944
Go inside the house, Joey.

311
00:28:33,946 --> 00:28:35,446
- Now.
- Joey.

312
00:28:35,448 --> 00:28:38,382
Hey, Angie, I'm sorry.

313
00:28:38,384 --> 00:28:42,753
Your friends
gave Joey a ride home
from school today, Cam.

314
00:28:42,755 --> 00:28:47,291
Those assholes brought
my son home from school.

315
00:28:47,293 --> 00:28:49,927
I don't know
what you're involved in,
and I don't want to know.

316
00:28:49,929 --> 00:28:51,428
Stay away from us.

317
00:28:51,430 --> 00:28:52,996
I mean it.

318
00:29:10,081 --> 00:29:12,249
Oh, hey look who's here.

319
00:29:12,251 --> 00:29:14,418
- Hey, what's up, buddy?
- Are you okay?

320
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:16,253
I want in.

321
00:29:18,022 --> 00:29:19,189
You are in.

322
00:29:20,526 --> 00:29:21,859
We don't just let
anybody train with us.

323
00:29:21,861 --> 00:29:25,529
No, I'm talking about work.

324
00:29:25,531 --> 00:29:27,831
Whatever you guys got going on
I want in on it.

325
00:29:32,904 --> 00:29:34,238
What's your problem?

326
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:36,373
What do you guys think,
I'm a narc or something?

327
00:29:36,375 --> 00:29:37,541
Come on.
Hey, Dylan.

328
00:29:37,543 --> 00:29:38,909
I need to talk to Miller.

329
00:29:38,911 --> 00:29:40,911
Hook me up.

330
00:29:40,913 --> 00:29:44,481
No, it's a bad idea.

331
00:29:44,483 --> 00:29:47,851
Why, you know
something I don't?

332
00:29:51,956 --> 00:29:53,557
We're in the
transport business, Cam.

333
00:29:53,559 --> 00:29:56,126
We move valuables.

334
00:29:56,128 --> 00:29:59,930
People hire us
to make obstacles go away,

335
00:29:59,932 --> 00:30:02,172
change hands,
land on someone else.

336
00:30:03,434 --> 00:30:06,834
The difference is
I provide assurances
that other people can't.

337
00:30:07,939 --> 00:30:09,907
I guarantee the work.

338
00:30:14,279 --> 00:30:15,546
You want
some evidence to disappear?

339
00:30:15,548 --> 00:30:17,881
We can take
of that for you.

340
00:30:22,387 --> 00:30:24,021
It's a profession.

341
00:30:24,023 --> 00:30:26,824
We're not thrill seekers who
pull any score that comes along.

342
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:38,068
The key is speed and silence.
In and out, fast and quiet.

343
00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:50,581
We do our research.
Plan every move.

344
00:30:50,583 --> 00:30:53,217
Work as a team.
Everyone knows their job.

345
00:31:19,912 --> 00:31:22,145
Documents. Chemicals.

346
00:31:22,147 --> 00:31:24,187
Technology. Anything.
We don't take sides.

347
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:43,600
Now I got just two rules.

348
00:31:46,471 --> 00:31:50,107
The first is,
if you get in trouble,
I'm your first call.

349
00:31:50,109 --> 00:31:51,575
The second,

350
00:31:51,577 --> 00:31:53,143
you stay out of Chinatown.

351
00:31:53,145 --> 00:31:55,312
Even if you're not on a job.

352
00:31:55,314 --> 00:31:56,647
Why is that?

353
00:31:56,649 --> 00:31:59,082
I'm inviting you to sit down
at the dinner table.

354
00:31:59,084 --> 00:32:01,124
Show me you know how
to be a good guest.

355
00:32:02,954 --> 00:32:03,954
Nice work.

356
00:32:07,191 --> 00:32:08,425
Dyl!

357
00:34:48,319 --> 00:34:49,419
Turn around!

358
00:34:53,558 --> 00:34:55,092
Hold on!

359
00:34:55,094 --> 00:34:56,493
- Don't move!
- I'm not.

360
00:34:56,495 --> 00:34:59,463
- Shut up! Shut up!
- I'm not moving!

361
00:34:59,465 --> 00:35:02,299
Who do you work for?

362
00:35:02,301 --> 00:35:04,768
- I said, who do you work for?
- Answer his question!

363
00:35:04,770 --> 00:35:06,303
No one!

364
00:35:06,305 --> 00:35:08,672
What's in the bag?

365
00:35:08,674 --> 00:35:11,141
- Tell me what's in the bag!
- I don't know!

366
00:35:11,143 --> 00:35:12,642
- Give it to me!
- No!

367
00:35:12,644 --> 00:35:14,744
Give it to me!
Give me the bag!

368
00:35:18,149 --> 00:35:20,350
You tell me what's in that bag!

369
00:35:20,352 --> 00:35:22,385
You tell me what's in that bag

370
00:35:22,387 --> 00:35:23,520
or I'm gonna
blow your brains out
right now!

371
00:35:23,522 --> 00:35:25,255
I swear to God!

372
00:35:25,257 --> 00:35:27,390
- What is in the bag!
- I just carry the bag!

373
00:35:35,633 --> 00:35:37,701
Good work, Cam.

374
00:35:42,507 --> 00:35:45,308
What... what's going on?

375
00:35:45,310 --> 00:35:47,444
You pulled some serious
moves out there, pal.

376
00:35:47,446 --> 00:35:49,613
Dude, we heard about the bus.
That was sick!

377
00:35:49,615 --> 00:35:51,915
And you, sir,
you were hauling ass!

378
00:35:51,917 --> 00:35:53,717
Hey, it's all right, buddy.

379
00:35:53,719 --> 00:35:55,218
We just had to make sure
you had our backs.

380
00:35:55,220 --> 00:35:57,687
You're family now.
What do you think?

381
00:35:59,257 --> 00:36:00,891
I think you're a bunch
of assholes.

382
00:36:00,893 --> 00:36:02,626
Especially you.

383
00:36:33,958 --> 00:36:35,959
- Hey.
- Hey.

384
00:36:35,961 --> 00:36:37,627
Where you taking me?

385
00:36:40,765 --> 00:36:43,466
All right.

386
00:36:43,468 --> 00:36:44,935
Where are the others?

387
00:36:44,937 --> 00:36:46,269
They're busy.

388
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:50,640
Well...

389
00:36:50,642 --> 00:36:52,442
you want to grab
a coffee or something?

390
00:36:52,444 --> 00:36:53,743
This isn't a date.

391
00:36:56,681 --> 00:37:00,121
I didn't...
I didn't mean it
like a date.

392
00:37:00,518 --> 00:37:01,851
Let's just get this done,
okay?

393
00:37:07,725 --> 00:37:09,559
So how long have you been
Working for Miller?

394
00:37:09,561 --> 00:37:10,694
A few years.

395
00:37:10,696 --> 00:37:13,230
Did you grow up
in the city?

396
00:37:13,232 --> 00:37:15,565
No.

397
00:37:15,567 --> 00:37:18,368
Where'd you learn how
to do parkour?

398
00:37:18,370 --> 00:37:19,703
Here.

399
00:37:21,539 --> 00:37:23,740
You still live with Dylan?

400
00:37:23,742 --> 00:37:25,775
Okay,
enough with the questions, okay?

401
00:37:27,979 --> 00:37:29,479
I'm just trying
to make conversation.

402
00:37:29,481 --> 00:37:31,314
Yeah,
but you wanted to be in.

403
00:37:31,316 --> 00:37:32,616
Guess what?
You're in.

404
00:37:32,618 --> 00:37:34,918
There's nothing left to discuss.

405
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:37,454
- What's your deal?
- My deal?

406
00:37:37,456 --> 00:37:39,656
- Yeah, what's your deal?
- I don't have a deal.

407
00:37:39,658 --> 00:37:41,625
- Then why are you
acting like this?
- Acting like what?

408
00:37:41,627 --> 00:37:44,494
I-I don't know.
I just thought we could...

409
00:37:44,496 --> 00:37:46,896
I didn't ask
you to come find me.

410
00:37:46,898 --> 00:37:49,399
Really?

411
00:37:49,401 --> 00:37:52,902
You sure about that?
You did give me that bike...

412
00:37:52,904 --> 00:37:55,538
I'm gonna tell Miller you can
work on your own next time.

413
00:37:55,540 --> 00:37:56,906
You don't need
a babysitter.

414
00:38:02,313 --> 00:38:03,780
Okay.

415
00:38:11,990 --> 00:38:13,323
This the new guy?

416
00:38:13,325 --> 00:38:15,525
Yeah.

417
00:38:15,527 --> 00:38:17,327
Good luck, new guy.

418
00:38:19,697 --> 00:38:21,031
Dylan.

419
00:38:21,033 --> 00:38:22,365
Jax.

420
00:38:22,367 --> 00:38:23,700
Nikki.

421
00:38:23,702 --> 00:38:25,035
Tate.

422
00:38:25,037 --> 00:38:26,837
Employee of the month,
Cam.

423
00:38:55,366 --> 00:38:56,700
Angie?

424
00:38:59,937 --> 00:39:02,372
What are you doing here,
Cam? I'm working.

425
00:39:02,374 --> 00:39:03,707
I know.

426
00:39:03,709 --> 00:39:05,775
I brought your rent money.

427
00:39:05,777 --> 00:39:08,945
I don't care
what you brought.

428
00:39:08,947 --> 00:39:11,414
I told you to leave us
alone, right?

429
00:39:11,416 --> 00:39:12,749
Angie...

430
00:39:16,954 --> 00:39:18,455
Angie, please.

431
00:39:19,991 --> 00:39:21,424
Hey, hey.

432
00:39:25,796 --> 00:39:27,931
Please take it.

433
00:39:27,933 --> 00:39:29,366
Okay?

434
00:39:31,135 --> 00:39:33,937
It'll hold you over until you
find somebody else to move in.

435
00:39:35,873 --> 00:39:37,707
This is too much.

436
00:39:40,644 --> 00:39:42,844
What kind of trouble
are you in?

437
00:39:47,151 --> 00:39:50,954
My mom got sick
after she lost her job.

438
00:39:50,956 --> 00:39:52,822
So I borrowed some money
off the street

439
00:39:52,824 --> 00:39:54,791
to try and help her
keep the house.

440
00:39:57,495 --> 00:39:59,396
It wasn't enough.

441
00:39:59,398 --> 00:40:01,965
So the bank foreclosed on her
a week before she died.

442
00:40:05,703 --> 00:40:07,537
You got a good heart, Cam,

443
00:40:07,539 --> 00:40:10,540
but you got to be careful.

444
00:40:10,542 --> 00:40:12,609
Further you go down
the wrong road,

445
00:40:12,611 --> 00:40:15,011
the harder it gets
to find your way back.

446
00:40:19,183 --> 00:40:20,850
I gotta get back to work.

447
00:40:22,753 --> 00:40:25,073
Wait, one sec.
One sec.

448
00:40:29,093 --> 00:40:32,061
Can you give this to Joey?

449
00:40:32,063 --> 00:40:34,731
You don't have
to tell him it's from me.

450
00:40:40,571 --> 00:40:42,572
I'm sorry for everything.

451
00:40:42,574 --> 00:40:43,854
I really am.

452
00:40:47,044 --> 00:40:50,644
I won't bother
you guys again,
I promise.

453
00:41:21,545 --> 00:41:22,679
Hey.

454
00:41:24,849 --> 00:41:27,016
What do you think, man?

455
00:41:27,018 --> 00:41:29,819
Factory paint,
marine grey.

456
00:41:29,821 --> 00:41:31,821
14 inch rally wheels.

457
00:41:35,693 --> 00:41:36,993
You got something for us?

458
00:41:43,901 --> 00:41:47,537
Uh, that's not even
two grand here, man.

459
00:41:47,539 --> 00:41:48,972
I need 10.

460
00:41:48,974 --> 00:41:51,107
Give me a few more weeks
I'll get it to you.

461
00:41:51,109 --> 00:41:53,843
Well, that's past
the deadline, Cam.

462
00:41:53,845 --> 00:41:54,978
I was hoping
we could renegotiate.

463
00:41:54,980 --> 00:41:57,680
Look, I got a new job.

464
00:41:57,682 --> 00:41:58,982
You can raise the vig
if you want to...

465
00:41:58,984 --> 00:42:00,283
Ugh!

466
00:42:01,853 --> 00:42:03,887
You're still acting
like I'm the boss, Cam.

467
00:42:03,889 --> 00:42:06,756
I'm not, all right?
Chen is the boss.

468
00:42:06,758 --> 00:42:09,125
The money you owe me,
I own Chen!

469
00:42:12,763 --> 00:42:15,798
You put me
in a tight spot here, Cam.

470
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:17,267
Now I don't want
to see anything happen

471
00:42:17,269 --> 00:42:20,970
to your friend
and her little boy, but...

472
00:42:20,972 --> 00:42:24,140
you don't make
this right, it will.

473
00:42:24,142 --> 00:42:25,542
Those are the rules.

474
00:42:27,678 --> 00:42:28,711
Ugh!

475
00:42:34,852 --> 00:42:35,985
Two weeks, Cam.

476
00:42:38,689 --> 00:42:40,023
10 grand.

477
00:42:57,875 --> 00:42:59,842
- Unh.

478
00:43:04,148 --> 00:43:05,848
Yeah?

479
00:43:05,850 --> 00:43:09,719
- We're going out tonight.
- Want to come?

480
00:43:09,721 --> 00:43:11,821
- Work?
- More like play.

481
00:43:26,637 --> 00:43:28,972
Can I get a water?

482
00:43:28,974 --> 00:43:30,940
Hey, what happened here?

483
00:43:32,643 --> 00:43:33,977
- This?
- Yeah.

484
00:43:33,979 --> 00:43:35,845
I biffed a wall trick.

485
00:43:35,847 --> 00:43:38,881
- Oh, how's the wall?

486
00:43:38,883 --> 00:43:41,918
Check this out.
Got it on a broken rail.

487
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:45,121
- That's nothing man.
- Check this out.

488
00:43:45,123 --> 00:43:46,756
Razor wire.

489
00:43:49,126 --> 00:43:51,027
Dylan, why don't you show them
what happened right here, huh?

490
00:43:51,029 --> 00:43:53,296
- Is that from a curb?
- Nah.

491
00:43:53,298 --> 00:43:54,797
It was a older lady.

492
00:43:54,799 --> 00:43:57,967
He loves the cougar's.
Yeah.

493
00:43:57,969 --> 00:44:00,003
She was a nice girl.

494
00:44:00,005 --> 00:44:01,337
She was Chinese.
She was real smart.

495
00:44:01,339 --> 00:44:03,039
I met her on the subway.

496
00:44:03,041 --> 00:44:06,909
I see her walking down the
street one night with this guy.

497
00:44:06,911 --> 00:44:09,045
I assume it must be her
cousin or something.

498
00:44:09,047 --> 00:44:12,081
So I go up to her,
I give her a big hug and a kiss.

499
00:44:12,083 --> 00:44:14,050
And she freaks out.
Like she's never seen me before.

500
00:44:14,052 --> 00:44:15,752
Goes totally ape shit.

501
00:44:15,754 --> 00:44:18,755
Turns out her cuz'
was her husband.

502
00:44:18,757 --> 00:44:21,391
Yeah, husband,
mixed-martial artist.

503
00:44:21,393 --> 00:44:23,026
Bad news
for the lady killer.

504
00:44:23,028 --> 00:44:25,895
Is that why
we can't cut though Chinatown?

505
00:44:25,897 --> 00:44:27,363
No, that's all Miller,
man.

506
00:44:27,365 --> 00:44:29,365
He's got bad blood
with the gangs there.

507
00:44:29,367 --> 00:44:31,734
- What, the Tongs?
- Yeah.

508
00:44:31,736 --> 00:44:33,369
Yeah,
some business went south.

509
00:44:33,371 --> 00:44:35,931
He had to cut a deal,
promise to stay away.

510
00:44:37,374 --> 00:44:38,875
You know,
Nikki's got some cute marks.

511
00:44:38,877 --> 00:44:41,210
Hey, hey.

512
00:44:41,212 --> 00:44:43,312
I don't know
what he's talking about.

513
00:44:43,314 --> 00:44:45,181
It's not happening.

514
00:44:45,183 --> 00:44:47,183
If I show you,
I'd have to kill ya.

515
00:44:47,185 --> 00:44:49,919
He said it.

516
00:44:49,921 --> 00:44:52,388
There she is!
The future Mrs. Jackson Smith.

517
00:44:52,390 --> 00:44:54,023
- Right there.
- Oh, yeah?

518
00:44:54,025 --> 00:44:55,792
That's gonna be
my future ex-wife.

519
00:44:55,794 --> 00:44:58,227
Yeah, we're gonna move
to the countryside.

520
00:44:58,229 --> 00:45:01,097
Make lots
of sweet ginger babies
every night of the week.

521
00:45:01,099 --> 00:45:02,899
- Oh, that's a terrible visual!
- Then rest of our lives.

522
00:45:02,901 --> 00:45:05,835
- Ugh!
- I know, you're jealous.

523
00:45:08,906 --> 00:45:10,626
You guys know nothing
about women.

524
00:46:59,049 --> 00:47:00,116
Hey.

525
00:47:01,218 --> 00:47:02,552
Hey, Hey.

526
00:47:02,554 --> 00:47:04,420
- What happened?
- Nothing.

527
00:47:04,422 --> 00:47:05,922
It's just stuffy
as hell in there.

528
00:47:05,924 --> 00:47:07,423
That's all.

529
00:47:07,425 --> 00:47:09,392
Do you wanna...
do you wanna
get out of here?

530
00:47:09,394 --> 00:47:10,526
You want to go
somewhere else?

531
00:47:10,528 --> 00:47:13,229
Not right now.
No, I can't.

532
00:47:13,231 --> 00:47:14,897
Hey, what's wrong with you?

533
00:47:18,402 --> 00:47:20,282
Nikki,
what are you afraid of?

534
00:47:27,911 --> 00:47:30,413
Hey, guys.

535
00:47:30,415 --> 00:47:31,914
Sorry I missed the fun.

536
00:47:31,916 --> 00:47:34,450
I had some business
to take care of.

537
00:47:34,452 --> 00:47:35,952
Yeah.

538
00:47:43,126 --> 00:47:44,360
Hey, you okay?

539
00:47:44,362 --> 00:47:47,163
Yeah, I'm fine.

540
00:47:47,165 --> 00:47:49,232
Hey, Cam.

541
00:47:49,234 --> 00:47:51,534
If you need anything at all,
call me.

542
00:47:51,536 --> 00:47:53,202
- All right?
- Yeah.

543
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:18,394
Coming back in?

544
00:48:21,598 --> 00:48:24,267
No, I'm tired.
I'm...

545
00:48:24,269 --> 00:48:25,401
gonna hit it.

546
00:49:34,172 --> 00:49:35,204
Hey.

547
00:49:37,741 --> 00:49:40,276
What are you doing here?

548
00:49:40,278 --> 00:49:41,477
Wanted to talk to you.

549
00:49:46,183 --> 00:49:47,316
How did you find me?

550
00:49:50,087 --> 00:49:51,387
Why are you living
on the roof?

551
00:49:56,093 --> 00:49:58,613
Why didn't you tell me
you were with Miller?

552
00:50:07,704 --> 00:50:09,605
Dylan got into some trouble.

553
00:50:11,742 --> 00:50:13,576
And Miller made it go away.

554
00:50:18,615 --> 00:50:20,750
So your brother
pimped you out to the boss.

555
00:50:20,752 --> 00:50:22,451
Sounds pretty simple to me.

556
00:50:22,453 --> 00:50:24,373
- Miller doesn't own me.
- Is that right?

557
00:50:29,493 --> 00:50:31,193
Why are you here?

558
00:50:31,195 --> 00:50:32,528
What's the point?

559
00:50:32,530 --> 00:50:35,364
I should have told you.

560
00:50:35,366 --> 00:50:37,033
It's my fault, but...

561
00:50:37,035 --> 00:50:38,367
Cam you wouldn't even
be here if I...

562
00:50:38,369 --> 00:50:40,469
- So you want me to quit?
- You can still walk.

563
00:50:40,471 --> 00:50:41,804
Is that what you want?

564
00:50:41,806 --> 00:50:43,272
I don't want
you to owe Miller
like we do!

565
00:50:43,274 --> 00:50:45,141
Do you want me to go?

566
00:50:53,183 --> 00:50:54,517
No...

567
00:51:44,469 --> 00:51:47,770
I heard once
tattoo's are like scars

568
00:51:47,772 --> 00:51:50,706
that you wear on the outside

569
00:51:50,708 --> 00:51:52,708
to show the pain
that's on the inside.

570
00:51:52,710 --> 00:51:53,876
Is that true?

571
00:51:56,580 --> 00:51:57,860
I don't know.

572
00:52:00,250 --> 00:52:02,785
Why don't you have any?

573
00:52:02,787 --> 00:52:04,753
'Cause I don't want
anyone to know.

574
00:52:13,130 --> 00:52:14,730
I owe people money, Nikki.

575
00:52:20,303 --> 00:52:22,743
And as soon as
I pay them off...

576
00:52:24,908 --> 00:52:26,408
I'm gone.

577
00:52:37,455 --> 00:52:39,288
And this moment
was brought to you by

578
00:52:39,290 --> 00:52:41,423
the sounds of summer
in New York City.

579
00:52:43,294 --> 00:52:45,594
Yeah, we're in a
over-crowded prison.

580
00:52:45,596 --> 00:52:47,296
Uh, I don't really mind it.

581
00:52:47,298 --> 00:52:48,631
- No?
- No.

582
00:52:48,633 --> 00:52:50,166
I mean,
before I left Florida,

583
00:52:50,168 --> 00:52:52,902
I'd never even seen a town
bigger than 500 people.

584
00:52:55,305 --> 00:52:57,306
Well, you're lucky,

585
00:52:57,308 --> 00:53:00,809
'cause all I've ever seen
is this jungle.

586
00:53:00,811 --> 00:53:02,344
You've never been
outside the city?

587
00:53:03,914 --> 00:53:06,882
No.

588
00:53:06,884 --> 00:53:08,884
I mean,
I don't count my jail time.

589
00:53:14,724 --> 00:53:16,392
I tried to leave.

590
00:53:16,394 --> 00:53:19,762
When?

591
00:53:19,764 --> 00:53:21,463
After my mom died.

592
00:53:24,968 --> 00:53:28,737
When she passed away,
I found out that

593
00:53:28,739 --> 00:53:32,274
she had my dad's old car.

594
00:53:32,276 --> 00:53:35,444
And she never told me
while she was alive,

595
00:53:35,446 --> 00:53:36,946
'cause she was afraid
if I found out

596
00:53:36,948 --> 00:53:38,748
I'd sell it to
try and help her out.

597
00:53:44,287 --> 00:53:47,590
So, uh...

598
00:53:47,592 --> 00:53:48,991
she kept it a secret.

599
00:53:50,727 --> 00:53:53,596
She wrote me a letter.

600
00:53:53,598 --> 00:53:55,898
She said she wanted me
to fix it up,

601
00:53:55,900 --> 00:53:58,400
get it running again.

602
00:53:58,402 --> 00:54:01,604
Just hop in and drive.

603
00:54:01,606 --> 00:54:03,305
Somewhere...

604
00:54:03,307 --> 00:54:05,441
I don't know where,
far away.

605
00:54:05,443 --> 00:54:06,909
California maybe.

606
00:54:09,279 --> 00:54:10,913
That was the plan.

607
00:54:12,549 --> 00:54:15,751
Well, where's the car now?

608
00:54:18,289 --> 00:54:20,723
The ahh...

609
00:54:20,725 --> 00:54:22,324
the bank took it.

610
00:54:22,326 --> 00:54:23,993
- The bank?
- Uh-uh.

611
00:54:23,995 --> 00:54:25,527
Oh.

612
00:54:29,833 --> 00:54:31,267
I guess I'm just one
of those people

613
00:54:31,269 --> 00:54:34,303
who can never hold
onto anything nice.

614
00:54:34,305 --> 00:54:36,505
I'll agree with that.

615
00:54:36,507 --> 00:54:37,806
Haha.

616
00:55:08,471 --> 00:55:11,940
Where you been, baby?

617
00:55:11,942 --> 00:55:13,609
I went for a walk.

618
00:55:48,345 --> 00:55:49,645
Anything wrong?

619
00:55:49,647 --> 00:55:51,080
Hmm?

620
00:55:51,082 --> 00:55:53,482
No.

621
00:55:53,484 --> 00:55:55,050
Nothing,
you know I just...

622
00:55:55,052 --> 00:55:57,353
get nervous
before the big jobs.

623
00:55:57,355 --> 00:55:59,655
That's all.

624
00:55:59,657 --> 00:56:01,890
Sure that's all?

625
00:56:01,892 --> 00:56:04,393
You seem kind of distant.

626
00:56:04,395 --> 00:56:06,428
Yeah.

627
00:56:06,430 --> 00:56:08,931
Like you're
somewhere else.

628
00:56:08,933 --> 00:56:11,133
No.

629
00:56:11,135 --> 00:56:12,801
Right here, James.

630
00:56:18,808 --> 00:56:20,888
I don't know what I'd do
without you.

631
00:56:24,814 --> 00:56:26,094
You know that?

632
00:56:27,984 --> 00:56:30,552
I'm just tired.

633
00:56:30,554 --> 00:56:32,588
I'm gonna go to bed.

634
00:56:36,626 --> 00:56:37,906
Sure.

635
00:57:17,667 --> 00:57:18,967
He's getting better.

636
00:57:23,940 --> 00:57:25,474
Nikki and I were living
on the streets

637
00:57:25,476 --> 00:57:26,975
when we found parkour.

638
00:57:26,977 --> 00:57:30,112
We got hooked.
It was like being kids again.

639
00:57:30,114 --> 00:57:33,649
The whole city
is our playground.

640
00:57:33,651 --> 00:57:35,651
Is that where
you met Miller?

641
00:57:35,653 --> 00:57:39,521
Uh-huh. Yeah.
Miller raised us.

642
00:57:39,523 --> 00:57:41,657
Taught us everything we knew,
got us off the streets.

643
00:57:41,659 --> 00:57:43,158
We'd be nowhere without him.

644
00:57:43,160 --> 00:57:46,028
Yeah, Nikki said
that she got you out

645
00:57:46,030 --> 00:57:47,129
of some sort of trouble
or something.

646
00:57:47,131 --> 00:57:48,831
Nikki said that?

647
00:57:48,833 --> 00:57:50,599
Yeah.

648
00:57:53,503 --> 00:57:55,838
What'd she tell you,
exactly?

649
00:57:55,840 --> 00:57:57,606
I mean,
nothing specifically.

650
00:57:57,608 --> 00:58:01,243
Just that you got
in some sort of trouble.

651
00:58:01,245 --> 00:58:03,545
And he made it go away.

652
00:58:05,215 --> 00:58:07,749
But she really cares
about you.

653
00:58:07,751 --> 00:58:10,151
She doesn't want
to see you get hurt.

654
00:58:11,020 --> 00:58:12,488
Are you in some sort
of trouble, Cam?

655
00:58:14,090 --> 00:58:15,824
'Cause if you are,
and Miller finds out,

656
00:58:15,826 --> 00:58:17,793
it's not just you.
That's trouble for all of us.

657
00:58:19,562 --> 00:58:20,829
And he always finds out.

658
00:58:22,265 --> 00:58:24,032
No.

659
00:58:24,034 --> 00:58:25,667
I'm all good.

660
00:58:26,903 --> 00:58:29,838
Good.

661
00:58:29,840 --> 00:58:31,607
I got the last one.

662
00:58:33,810 --> 00:58:34,910
Unit 17 code...

663
00:58:47,924 --> 00:58:48,957
All clear, good job.

664
00:58:48,959 --> 00:58:50,826
Whoo!

665
00:58:50,828 --> 00:58:52,928
That's how we do it!

666
00:59:21,224 --> 00:59:22,624
Wait.

667
00:59:22,626 --> 00:59:24,660
I'll catch up
with you later?

668
00:59:24,662 --> 00:59:26,929
Sure. Talk later.

669
00:59:26,931 --> 00:59:30,098
What do you mean?
Where's our money?

670
00:59:30,100 --> 00:59:33,035
Payday is next week,
Cam, same as usual.

671
00:59:33,037 --> 00:59:35,837
Okay, when's the next
gig happening?

672
00:59:35,839 --> 00:59:36,939
Soon.

673
00:59:36,941 --> 00:59:39,841
Hey, you did a good job.
Get some rest.

674
00:59:39,843 --> 00:59:41,403
You don't understand.
I need that money.

675
00:59:42,979 --> 00:59:44,846
Do we have a problem?

676
00:59:44,848 --> 00:59:46,281
No. No.

677
00:59:46,283 --> 00:59:48,750
No problem.

678
00:59:48,752 --> 00:59:51,320
I've got a big job
coming up next week.

679
00:59:51,322 --> 00:59:53,522
It's worth 15,
20 grand each at least.

680
00:59:55,325 --> 00:59:56,605
Does that work for you guys?

681
00:59:57,827 --> 00:59:59,795
- Sweet. Sounds good.
- Yeah.

682
01:00:00,897 --> 01:00:03,217
How about you, Cam?
Work for you?

683
01:00:03,967 --> 01:00:06,034
Yeah, that works.

684
01:00:06,036 --> 01:00:07,669
Good.

685
01:00:31,995 --> 01:00:35,764
You look just
like your dad.

686
01:00:35,766 --> 01:00:37,099
Yeah, I get that a lot.

687
01:00:39,769 --> 01:00:42,104
It's a nice...

688
01:00:42,106 --> 01:00:45,207
constant reminder
of the amazing father he was.

689
01:00:48,811 --> 01:00:49,978
Well, if it's
any consolation,

690
01:00:49,980 --> 01:00:54,116
my dad wasn't exactly
a real winner either.

691
01:00:57,320 --> 01:01:02,991
Sometimes it's
better not to know.

692
01:01:02,993 --> 01:01:03,993
Yeah.

693
01:01:15,672 --> 01:01:19,274
You're just going
to leave, aren't you?

694
01:01:19,276 --> 01:01:20,709
You should come with me.

695
01:01:22,311 --> 01:01:23,812
Yeah, right.

696
01:01:23,814 --> 01:01:24,814
Why "yeah, right"?

697
01:01:24,815 --> 01:01:25,815
I can't.

698
01:01:25,816 --> 01:01:27,883
Why not?

699
01:01:27,885 --> 01:01:29,885
It's complicated.

700
01:01:36,993 --> 01:01:38,293
Well...

701
01:01:40,697 --> 01:01:45,300
I'm not going anywhere
without wheels.

702
01:01:45,302 --> 01:01:47,769
Hold on to this for me.

703
01:01:53,476 --> 01:01:55,877
Thank you.

704
01:02:08,224 --> 01:02:10,225
Nice spot.

705
01:02:11,961 --> 01:02:14,096
I can see all the way
into the future from up here.

706
01:02:14,098 --> 01:02:16,418
Yeah, what happened
to staying in the moment?

707
01:02:19,802 --> 01:02:21,642
You're a good student,
Cam.

708
01:02:25,241 --> 01:02:27,042
Now you're moving
beyond what you've been taught.

709
01:02:27,044 --> 01:02:31,046
But outside there's
a natural order to things.

710
01:02:31,048 --> 01:02:35,083
You know, there can be
only one alpha for every pack.

711
01:02:35,085 --> 01:02:37,152
And that my friend,
I learned the hard way.

712
01:02:37,154 --> 01:02:38,520
A long time ago.

713
01:02:38,522 --> 01:02:40,956
In the back
of a Chinese restaurant,

714
01:02:40,958 --> 01:02:43,438
trying to beg for my life
with a gun in my mouth.

715
01:02:46,829 --> 01:02:49,110
Is there something
you need to tell me, Cam?

716
01:02:51,334 --> 01:02:52,334
There's nothing.

717
01:02:54,771 --> 01:02:56,051
You sure?

718
01:02:57,907 --> 01:02:58,974
Yeah, I'm sure.

719
01:03:03,346 --> 01:03:06,381
You should get
some plants up here.

720
01:03:06,383 --> 01:03:07,916
Liven this place up a bit.

721
01:03:09,385 --> 01:03:10,952
Pickup tomorrow at 9:30.

722
01:03:26,068 --> 01:03:27,068
Hey guys.

723
01:03:28,437 --> 01:03:29,471
Where's Nikki?

724
01:03:31,040 --> 01:03:32,507
Gave her the day off.

725
01:03:36,179 --> 01:03:39,581
Two minutes.

726
01:03:39,583 --> 01:03:41,583
You'll be needing this.

727
01:03:46,189 --> 01:03:49,024
Wait, we're
going in strong?

728
01:03:49,026 --> 01:03:50,892
I told you
it was big, my friend.

729
01:03:50,894 --> 01:03:51,927
You're gonna
get a cut.

730
01:03:51,929 --> 01:03:53,649
Twenty grand each.
Maybe more.

731
01:03:55,531 --> 01:03:57,199
I didn't sign up for this.

732
01:03:59,969 --> 01:04:01,469
Okay,
it's up here on the corner.

733
01:04:05,174 --> 01:04:06,174
We're doing a bank?

734
01:04:08,945 --> 01:04:11,313
Old bank. New money.

735
01:04:11,315 --> 01:04:12,315
BTK bought it.

736
01:04:12,316 --> 01:04:13,849
BTK?

737
01:04:13,851 --> 01:04:15,150
Vietnamese bangers.

738
01:04:15,152 --> 01:04:16,451
This is their laundromat.

739
01:04:16,453 --> 01:04:18,420
They keep a big stack,
couple hundred K.

740
01:04:18,422 --> 01:04:20,155
How do you know all this?

741
01:04:20,157 --> 01:04:21,223
That's my job.

742
01:04:23,359 --> 01:04:24,479
How we getting
in this thing?

743
01:04:25,294 --> 01:04:27,562
The front door.

744
01:04:27,564 --> 01:04:28,597
What?

745
01:04:29,932 --> 01:04:31,867
You're risking
a lot here, man.

746
01:04:31,869 --> 01:04:33,629
Tell your man
to make this look good.

747
01:04:35,504 --> 01:04:36,972
Okay, game time.

748
01:04:38,174 --> 01:04:39,174
Who's got my piece?

749
01:04:40,509 --> 01:04:43,011
You're carrying
the package.

750
01:04:43,013 --> 01:04:45,046
You'll be all right.
We've done this before.

751
01:04:45,048 --> 01:04:46,882
We don't even shoot
these things.

752
01:04:46,884 --> 01:04:48,724
Be safe, kids,
stay out of trouble.

753
01:04:57,627 --> 01:04:58,627
Masks!

754
01:05:18,347 --> 01:05:19,581
Hand off the gun!

755
01:05:21,951 --> 01:05:23,285
Toss him the gun!

756
01:05:24,287 --> 01:05:25,420
Toss him the gun!

757
01:05:27,290 --> 01:05:29,357
You deaf?
Toss him the gun!

758
01:05:33,229 --> 01:05:35,069
You don't like
to listen, huh?

759
01:05:37,133 --> 01:05:38,133
Get on the ground!

760
01:05:41,038 --> 01:05:46,441
Get on the ground!
You deaf? Get on the floor!

761
01:05:49,445 --> 01:05:50,612
We got to get moving!

762
01:05:57,720 --> 01:06:00,155
What... what's
the combination?!

763
01:06:00,157 --> 01:06:01,256
Answer him!

764
01:06:08,497 --> 01:06:10,131
Tell me how we get inside!

765
01:06:11,567 --> 01:06:12,600
You think this is funny?!

766
01:06:12,602 --> 01:06:14,369
Tell me what the combo is!

767
01:06:14,371 --> 01:06:16,037
What, is everybody deaf
and dumb here?

768
01:06:16,039 --> 01:06:17,079
Answer his question!

769
01:06:21,110 --> 01:06:22,110
What's the combination?!

770
01:06:23,212 --> 01:06:24,492
I don't have it.

771
01:06:26,182 --> 01:06:27,462
Is there another way in?

772
01:06:29,452 --> 01:06:30,732
Yo, come on!

773
01:06:33,122 --> 01:06:34,402
I can get in.

774
01:06:35,124 --> 01:06:36,124
What the hell
are you doing?

775
01:06:36,126 --> 01:06:38,686
I can't see shit
with this thing!

776
01:06:55,579 --> 01:06:56,579
We got to move, guys!

777
01:06:56,580 --> 01:06:59,280
There's nothing.
It's empty!

778
01:06:59,282 --> 01:07:01,082
- Check again!
- With nothing!

779
01:07:03,486 --> 01:07:04,486
Where's the money?!

780
01:07:04,488 --> 01:07:05,768
I don't know, dude.
I don't know.

781
01:07:06,622 --> 01:07:08,423
What are you
laughing at, big guy?!

782
01:07:08,425 --> 01:07:09,425
They picked it up early.

783
01:07:11,561 --> 01:07:13,161
But he wouldn't
have known that.

784
01:07:13,163 --> 01:07:15,130
Would you?

785
01:07:15,132 --> 01:07:17,232
Would you?

786
01:07:17,234 --> 01:07:18,133
Dude, let's just go!

787
01:07:18,135 --> 01:07:19,434
You're dead.

788
01:07:19,436 --> 01:07:20,535
Back up!

789
01:07:41,057 --> 01:07:42,390
A-ha!

790
01:07:42,392 --> 01:07:44,232
Where you going,
little bitch?

791
01:07:48,564 --> 01:07:50,565
Go! Go! Go!

792
01:07:50,567 --> 01:07:52,634
You better run!

793
01:08:20,629 --> 01:08:22,230
Come on! Come on! Come on!

794
01:08:34,743 --> 01:08:35,743
Back! Back! Back!

795
01:09:41,777 --> 01:09:42,777
Come on! Come on!

796
01:10:13,976 --> 01:10:17,879
Freeze! Stay down!

797
01:10:17,881 --> 01:10:20,481
Put your hands up
where I can see them, now!

798
01:10:22,351 --> 01:10:24,686
Stay right there,
get down!

799
01:10:41,370 --> 01:10:44,405
How about your dead buddy,
huh? Does he got a name?

800
01:10:44,407 --> 01:10:45,873
I don't know, might be nice
to let his family know

801
01:10:45,875 --> 01:10:47,575
where to pick up
his remains.

802
01:10:47,577 --> 01:10:49,577
He doesn't have any family.

803
01:10:49,579 --> 01:10:51,512
What the hell did you do
to get half the BTK

804
01:10:51,514 --> 01:10:53,348
to chase your little asses
down the street?

805
01:10:53,350 --> 01:10:56,351
Look, if you had anything
real to charge me with

806
01:10:56,353 --> 01:10:57,485
you wouldn't
be asking.

807
01:11:04,760 --> 01:11:05,860
The Feds would like
a word with you.

808
01:11:05,862 --> 01:11:07,362
Ooh!

809
01:11:09,665 --> 01:11:10,945
Have fun, kid.

810
01:11:16,672 --> 01:11:17,672
Miller?

811
01:11:17,674 --> 01:11:18,674
No sudden moves, okay?

812
01:11:18,675 --> 01:11:22,610
James Hatcher.
I'm with the DEA.

813
01:11:22,612 --> 01:11:24,712
You thought jumping a 20-foot
gap, five stories up was a rush?

814
01:11:24,714 --> 01:11:28,283
Just breathe for me, Cam, okay?
We don't have much time.

815
01:11:29,918 --> 01:11:31,319
Where's Dylan and Tate?

816
01:11:31,321 --> 01:11:32,487
They're in the van
on the way home.

817
01:11:32,489 --> 01:11:33,454
They should be hitting
the tunnel by now.

818
01:11:33,456 --> 01:11:34,456
Do they know about this?

819
01:11:34,457 --> 01:11:35,857
Cam, they all know.

820
01:11:35,859 --> 01:11:37,592
How the hell do you think
I ran this circus?

821
01:11:37,594 --> 01:11:39,294
Miller's a man on the ground,
shipping and receiving,

822
01:11:39,296 --> 01:11:40,862
HR, transpo.

823
01:11:40,864 --> 01:11:42,297
Hatcher's upstairs...
due diligence,

824
01:11:42,299 --> 01:11:44,866
Neither one
of them gets much sleep,

825
01:11:44,868 --> 01:11:45,967
but they work
well together.

826
01:11:45,969 --> 01:11:47,502
You got to be kidding me.

827
01:11:47,504 --> 01:11:49,370
I've been working
for a dirty Fed this whole time?

828
01:11:49,372 --> 01:11:51,772
Yeah, or a clean criminal.
Depends on your point of view.

829
01:11:53,876 --> 01:11:54,876
What about Jax, huh?

830
01:11:58,380 --> 01:12:01,716
Look, I got bad intel
on this one.

831
01:12:01,718 --> 01:12:04,352
Okay, and Jax is gone.

832
01:12:04,354 --> 01:12:06,521
But that's the past.
All we have is the moment.

833
01:12:06,523 --> 01:12:07,722
And right now,
in this moment,

834
01:12:07,724 --> 01:12:09,090
New York P.D. thinks
you're one of my CI's.

835
01:12:09,092 --> 01:12:10,758
That means you get
to walk out of here with me,

836
01:12:10,760 --> 01:12:12,627
right now,
under my protection.

837
01:12:12,629 --> 01:12:13,628
Yeah, so they
can find my body

838
01:12:13,630 --> 01:12:14,996
in a dumpster tomorrow
morning?

839
01:12:14,998 --> 01:12:16,964
No, thank you!

840
01:12:16,966 --> 01:12:18,833
Cam, I'm not going to hurt you.
I need your help.

841
01:12:18,835 --> 01:12:20,768
The cops are rousting
the whole gang.

842
01:12:20,770 --> 01:12:22,337
Sooner or later someone
is going to talk themselves

843
01:12:22,339 --> 01:12:24,259
out of trouble
and that will lead back to me.

844
01:12:25,641 --> 01:12:26,974
It's time for me
to cash out.

845
01:12:26,976 --> 01:12:29,911
Is this your
"one last score" speech?

846
01:12:29,913 --> 01:12:31,012
Save it.

847
01:12:31,014 --> 01:12:32,480
It's my exit plan.

848
01:12:32,482 --> 01:12:33,881
But I cannot do it
without your help.

849
01:12:33,883 --> 01:12:37,118
If you want me,
I need my 10 grand, today.

850
01:12:37,120 --> 01:12:39,354
Right now.
Then we'll talk.

851
01:12:39,356 --> 01:12:40,955
That's not going
to happen.

852
01:12:40,957 --> 01:12:42,056
Fine.

853
01:12:42,058 --> 01:12:43,524
Then I'm not helping you.

854
01:12:43,526 --> 01:12:45,727
All right. I'm out.

855
01:12:48,030 --> 01:12:52,767
The thing is, Cam, it's not
just about you anymore, is it?

856
01:12:52,769 --> 01:12:55,436
Because you became
part of a family.

857
01:12:55,438 --> 01:12:58,673
So you have to think
about the welfare of others.

858
01:13:03,112 --> 01:13:04,912
Where is she?

859
01:13:04,914 --> 01:13:07,548
I don't want
Nikki mixed up in this anymore.

860
01:13:07,550 --> 01:13:09,650
So you and I are going
to finish this.

861
01:13:33,008 --> 01:13:34,008
Hey!

862
01:13:35,477 --> 01:13:37,712
Why didn't you tell me? Hmm?

863
01:13:37,714 --> 01:13:38,980
I told you to get out.

864
01:13:38,982 --> 01:13:40,014
You played me
from the start.

865
01:13:40,016 --> 01:13:41,416
No.

866
01:13:41,418 --> 01:13:42,417
The bike,
that was all bullshit?

867
01:13:42,419 --> 01:13:43,419
- No.
- This has been

868
01:13:43,420 --> 01:13:44,420
a set-up the whole time?

869
01:13:44,421 --> 01:13:45,701
Cam, I swear it.
That was all me!

870
01:13:48,757 --> 01:13:50,892
I felt bad
for wrecking you out.

871
01:13:50,894 --> 01:13:52,627
I wanted
to get you a new one.

872
01:13:52,629 --> 01:13:54,162
I didn't think all of this
was going to happen.

873
01:13:54,164 --> 01:13:56,404
Well, then,
what did you think?

874
01:13:59,168 --> 01:14:00,468
You wanted in, Cam.

875
01:14:00,470 --> 01:14:03,137
No. I wanted you.

876
01:14:06,074 --> 01:14:08,176
I'm sorry.

877
01:14:08,178 --> 01:14:08,976
I'm sorry.
I wanted to tell you.

878
01:14:08,978 --> 01:14:10,478
I did!

879
01:14:10,480 --> 01:14:13,214
But... I couldn't.

880
01:14:13,216 --> 01:14:14,216
Why not?

881
01:14:14,217 --> 01:14:15,783
Because of Dylan.

882
01:14:15,785 --> 01:14:18,052
What do you mean
because of Dylan?

883
01:14:18,054 --> 01:14:20,922
That you couldn't tell me
this whole time?

884
01:14:20,924 --> 01:14:21,924
He...

885
01:14:24,927 --> 01:14:26,794
You know, Dylan is your
older brother, Nikki.

886
01:14:26,796 --> 01:14:28,062
You don't need
to babysit him.

887
01:14:28,064 --> 01:14:30,665
You can let him deal
with his own problems.

888
01:14:30,667 --> 01:14:32,967
Somebody did
something to me, okay.

889
01:14:32,969 --> 01:14:34,969
Back in Florida.

890
01:14:34,971 --> 01:14:38,239
Some scumbag came
into my bedroom late at night.

891
01:14:38,241 --> 01:14:40,041
He started touching me.

892
01:14:40,043 --> 01:14:43,478
Dylan walked in
and he beat him into a coma.

893
01:14:43,480 --> 01:14:44,812
The cops came after us.

894
01:14:44,814 --> 01:14:46,180
They chased us all the way
over here.

895
01:14:46,182 --> 01:14:48,216
And then I met Miller.

896
01:14:48,218 --> 01:14:52,954
And Miller made it
all go away.

897
01:14:52,956 --> 01:14:55,723
Dylan was there
that night to protect me.

898
01:14:55,725 --> 01:14:57,758
And now it's my job
to protect him.

899
01:14:59,928 --> 01:15:01,662
Cam, I was scared
to tell you anything else.

900
01:15:01,664 --> 01:15:05,233
Because I didn't want
you to go.

901
01:15:16,778 --> 01:15:20,915
Look...

902
01:15:20,917 --> 01:15:22,877
if I can get
us a clean exit tomorrow...

903
01:15:25,721 --> 01:15:26,854
will you come with me?

904
01:15:30,125 --> 01:15:32,059
Miller's not going
to let us just walk away.

905
01:15:32,061 --> 01:15:34,128
Do you wanna leave Miller
or not, Nikki?

906
01:16:04,326 --> 01:16:06,694
I told you
what could happen to Dylan,

907
01:16:06,696 --> 01:16:10,164
to us, if anything
ever went wrong.

908
01:16:10,166 --> 01:16:13,601
Do you remember?

909
01:16:13,603 --> 01:16:15,036
- Yeah.
- What?

910
01:16:15,038 --> 01:16:16,604
Yes!

911
01:16:20,676 --> 01:16:24,745
I'm getting us
out of this life.

912
01:16:24,747 --> 01:16:27,214
And we're going
to start over.

913
01:16:27,216 --> 01:16:30,051
Just you and me
this time.

914
01:16:30,053 --> 01:16:34,288
Okay?

915
01:17:14,363 --> 01:17:17,298
Where we going?

916
01:17:17,300 --> 01:17:18,165
The guys and I got
a plane to catch

917
01:17:18,167 --> 01:17:19,967
when we're done.

918
01:17:19,969 --> 01:17:22,903
We'll drop you
on the way to the airport.

919
01:17:22,905 --> 01:17:26,073
After you get your 10 grand,
of course.

920
01:17:26,075 --> 01:17:29,143
Here. Put these on.

921
01:17:29,145 --> 01:17:31,779
Let's go.

922
01:17:38,787 --> 01:17:41,187
Nikki and Tate will lookout
while we make the pickup, okay.

923
01:18:11,953 --> 01:18:12,953
Where are we?

924
01:18:12,955 --> 01:18:18,259
Russians keep their VIP's here,
They stash other stuff too.

925
01:18:18,261 --> 01:18:19,326
Well, what do you
need me for?

926
01:18:19,328 --> 01:18:21,462
It's a two-man job.

927
01:18:21,464 --> 01:18:22,863
Why can't Dylan go in...

928
01:18:22,865 --> 01:18:24,465
Dylan's watching our exit.

929
01:18:27,102 --> 01:18:28,869
How are we getting in?
Through the skylight?

930
01:18:28,871 --> 01:18:31,405
Copy that.

931
01:18:31,407 --> 01:18:32,473
What's inside there?

932
01:18:32,475 --> 01:18:34,008
New plateau, my friend.

933
01:18:39,047 --> 01:18:40,047
It's not loaded.

934
01:18:42,050 --> 01:18:44,151
You want me to go
in unarmed?

935
01:18:44,153 --> 01:18:45,186
I'm going in with you.

936
01:18:45,188 --> 01:18:46,420
It's you and me together
this time.

937
01:18:46,422 --> 01:18:48,456
All right?

938
01:18:50,959 --> 01:18:52,126
You're really down
with this, Dylan?

939
01:18:52,128 --> 01:18:54,929
How about you just do
your job, all right?

940
01:18:54,931 --> 01:18:58,966
Hey, get your head
in it, Cam. Right now.

941
01:18:58,968 --> 01:19:00,801
We're doing this for Nikki.

942
01:19:00,803 --> 01:19:01,869
Remember?

943
01:19:03,505 --> 01:19:04,505
Pull over.

944
01:19:04,507 --> 01:19:05,507
Why?

945
01:19:05,508 --> 01:19:08,476
'Cause I gotta
take a piss.

946
01:19:08,478 --> 01:19:10,478
Tate! Come on!

947
01:19:10,480 --> 01:19:12,079
- I can't.
- What?

948
01:19:12,081 --> 01:19:13,081
Come on, Nikki.

949
01:19:13,082 --> 01:19:14,402
Everybody knows
about you and Cam.

950
01:19:16,818 --> 01:19:17,818
Stop the van, Tate.

951
01:19:17,820 --> 01:19:19,353
- No.
- Pull over!

952
01:19:19,355 --> 01:19:21,288
Just shut up already!

953
01:19:24,292 --> 01:19:25,572
Pull the fuck over!

954
01:19:30,899 --> 01:19:32,933
Once we're inside, just
do everything I say.

955
01:19:32,935 --> 01:19:34,535
I've got this all
worked out.

956
01:19:34,537 --> 01:19:35,537
Sure landing.

957
01:19:35,538 --> 01:19:37,104
On three.

958
01:19:37,106 --> 01:19:38,106
Ready?

959
01:19:40,142 --> 01:19:42,176
One, two, three.

960
01:19:45,815 --> 01:19:47,014
Be quiet!

961
01:19:47,016 --> 01:19:48,096
Don't move! Don't move!

962
01:19:49,217 --> 01:19:50,217
Sit! Sit down!

963
01:19:57,826 --> 01:20:00,127
- What's going on!
- Watch them!

964
01:20:00,129 --> 01:20:01,409
Don't move!

965
01:20:15,577 --> 01:20:16,857
What's the exit plan?!

966
01:20:20,382 --> 01:20:23,250
Huh?

967
01:20:31,259 --> 01:20:32,459
This is the exit plan, Cam.

968
01:21:08,630 --> 01:21:10,064
Dylan, what are you doing!

969
01:21:10,066 --> 01:21:11,065
- Don't... don't move!
- Dylan...

970
01:21:11,067 --> 01:21:14,034
Do it! He's got
the diamonds!

971
01:21:14,036 --> 01:21:15,202
Dylan...

972
01:21:15,204 --> 01:21:16,204
Dylan, put the gun down!

973
01:21:16,205 --> 01:21:17,205
Don't move!

974
01:21:59,281 --> 01:22:00,481
All units, 10-10.

975
01:22:00,483 --> 01:22:03,284
Shots fired at 231 West 23rd.

976
01:22:03,286 --> 01:22:04,985
Repeat, shots fired.

977
01:23:45,587 --> 01:23:47,087
DEA, I'm taking your car!

978
01:23:47,089 --> 01:23:48,455
No!

979
01:24:32,700 --> 01:24:34,401
Nikki! Are you okay?!

980
01:24:34,403 --> 01:24:36,103
- Huh? Yeah. I'm okay.
- Are you okay?

981
01:24:36,105 --> 01:24:37,385
Come on, come on, come on.

982
01:24:40,842 --> 01:24:42,409
Come on!

983
01:25:03,698 --> 01:25:06,266
This way!

984
01:25:06,268 --> 01:25:08,535
No, no, no!

985
01:25:21,182 --> 01:25:22,416
I'm done!

986
01:25:24,486 --> 01:25:26,453
Move away, Nikki,
I don't want to hurt you!

987
01:25:31,860 --> 01:25:34,060
I'm not going to ask you
again, baby. Move away.

988
01:25:46,609 --> 01:25:48,842
Agent Hatcher.

989
01:25:48,844 --> 01:25:50,310
Chen?

990
01:25:50,312 --> 01:25:51,478
James...

991
01:26:00,388 --> 01:26:02,489
Okay, listen.
I can explain.

992
01:26:02,491 --> 01:26:03,757
There's been a mistake.

993
01:26:03,759 --> 01:26:05,459
There has.

994
01:26:05,461 --> 01:26:06,527
You made it.

995
01:26:06,529 --> 01:26:07,828
I believe
it was rule number two.

996
01:26:09,631 --> 01:26:10,731
Stay out of Chinatown.

997
01:26:13,202 --> 01:26:17,871
Watch your language!
You're in Chen's house now.

998
01:26:17,873 --> 01:26:20,941
I told you long time ago
to keep your business

999
01:26:20,943 --> 01:26:22,643
out of my neighborhood.

1000
01:26:22,645 --> 01:26:23,944
And I did, Chen, I did.

1001
01:26:23,946 --> 01:26:25,245
But this is personal.

1002
01:26:25,247 --> 01:26:26,847
So is this.

1003
01:26:26,849 --> 01:26:28,248
You've been making too
much trouble

1004
01:26:28,250 --> 01:26:29,483
for too many of my friends.

1005
01:26:29,485 --> 01:26:30,485
Okay.

1006
01:26:30,486 --> 01:26:33,187
Chen, listen to me,
please...

1007
01:26:33,189 --> 01:26:36,557
There is a boat leaving
for Macau in two hours.

1008
01:26:36,559 --> 01:26:38,725
Mr. Hu will make sure
you're on it.

1009
01:26:38,727 --> 01:26:39,727
Time to close you out.

1010
01:26:49,370 --> 01:26:51,930
You're dead,
both of you.

1011
01:26:53,908 --> 01:26:55,188
You're dead.

1012
01:27:03,618 --> 01:27:06,587
But enough about him.
You have something for me?

1013
01:27:25,306 --> 01:27:26,974
If I were you,

1014
01:27:26,976 --> 01:27:29,243
I'd seriously consider
leaving town.

1015
01:27:32,614 --> 01:27:33,847
Congratulations.

1016
01:27:35,250 --> 01:27:36,750
Your debt is clear.

1017
01:27:40,688 --> 01:27:43,323
That's it?

1018
01:27:43,325 --> 01:27:46,026
We're all done.

1019
01:27:46,028 --> 01:27:48,428
Wait.

1020
01:27:50,531 --> 01:27:52,633
What about our deal?

1021
01:28:13,022 --> 01:28:14,321
Where to?

1022
01:28:14,323 --> 01:28:16,723
Let's just drive.
