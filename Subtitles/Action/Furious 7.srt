00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:59,049

00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:01,851
You could do that. How's that
working out for you so far?

If you get the God's Eye for me,

493
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:26,004
I've already got authorization

You go from the hunted to the hunter.

And there's no place on Earth
Shaw can hide from you.

you and your family
don't go to any more funerals.

506

of gathering your team.

and reach their destination,

518
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:44,700
There's only one road
that leads in or out,

00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:46,820

Yeah, that's about it.

523

- You done?
- No, I'm not done.

524
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:58,180
So you all wanted me to break into

525
00:37:58,280 --> 00:37:59,884
a police station. Fine.

526
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:02,010
Then you asked me to stop a tank.

527
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:03,924
I wasn't happy about it, but I did it.

528
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:06,140
Then you came up with
this brilliant idea

529
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:09,660
to shoot down one
of the largest airplanes ever.

530
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:12,331
I shot that shit out of the sky. Mmm.

531
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:13,841
It's nothing.

532
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:16,205
But this right here, my friend,

533
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:17,540
happens to be

534
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:20,980
the stupidest idea
I've ever heard of in my life.

535
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:23,208
I forgot that you were the only one
to bring the plane down.

536
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:25,380
No, no. The only thing
I've ever seen him take down was

Okay.

556

It is impossible to hit it there.

557
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:18,780
That is literally the most secure
spot on the mountain.

558
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:21,326
Why? Because you cannot
physically access it.

559
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:23,620
See, that's what makes it so sweet.

560
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:26,300
Because it's the place that they
least expect us to hit them from.

(BRIAN TALKING INDISTINCTLY)

1595
02:07:28,240 --> 02:07:30,891
Things are gonna be different now.

(BRIAN LAUGHING)

1597
02:07:48,720 --> 02:07:50,404
(JACK TALKING INDISTINCTLY)

1598
02:07:54,000 --> 02:07:55,001
BRIAN: One more time.

1599
02:07:57,560 --> 02:07:59,562
You aren't going to say goodbye?

1600
02:08:10,920 --> 02:08:13,287
It's never goodbye.

1601
02:08:14,920 --> 02:08:18,606
MAN: (SINGING) It's been a long day

1602
02:08:19,120 --> 02:08:21,122
Without you, my friend

1603
02:08:21,760 --> 02:08:27,244
And I'll tell you all about it
when I see you again

1604
02:08:27,720 --> 02:08:30,451
We've come a long way

1605
02:08:30,960 --> 02:08:33,281
From where we began

1606
02:08:33,440 --> 02:08:38,924
Oh, I'll tell you all about it
when I see you again

1607
02:08:39,280 --> 02:08:41,931
When I see you again

1608
02:08:45,800 --> 02:08:48,780
First you both go out your way
And the vibe is feeling strong

1609
02:08:48,880 --> 02:08:51,700
And what's small turn to a friendship
A friendship turn into a bond

1610
02:08:51,800 --> 02:08:53,220
And that bond will never be broken

1611
02:08:53,320 --> 02:08:54,970
The love will never get lost

1612
02:08:55,080 --> 02:08:57,082
And the love will never get lost

1613
02:08:57,560 --> 02:08:59,140
And when brotherhood come first

1614
02:08:59,240 --> 02:09:00,810
Then the line will never be crossed

1615
02:09:00,920 --> 02:09:03,764
Established it on our own
When that line had to be drawn

1616
02:09:03,880 --> 02:09:06,884
And that line is what we reach
So remember me when I'm gone

1617
02:09:07,120 --> 02:09:09,487
it's been a long day

1618
02:09:10,120 --> 02:09:12,248
Without you, my friend

1619
02:09:12,760 --> 02:09:18,210
And I'll tell you all about it
when I see you again

1620
02:09:19,160 --> 02:09:21,162
When I see you again

1621
02:09:22,160 --> 02:09:24,527
Hey. You thought you could leave
without saying goodbye?

1622
02:09:32,280 --> 02:09:34,886
DOM: I used to say I live my life
a quarter-mile at a time.

1623
02:09:37,200 --> 02:09:39,931
And I think that's why we were brothers.

1624
02:09:40,720 --> 02:09:42,404
Because you did, too.

1625
02:09:44,480 --> 02:09:46,244
- This is your car.
- My car?

1626
02:09:52,680 --> 02:09:53,602
It's official.

1627
02:09:53,720 --> 02:09:54,767
You're all free.

1628
02:09:55,040 --> 02:09:57,122
Home sweet home.

1629
02:09:59,920 --> 02:10:01,604
- What's happening, dude?
- Thanks for the invite.

1630
02:10:06,720 --> 02:10:08,085
Wanna go for a drive?

1631
02:10:09,920 --> 02:10:11,126
DOM: No matter where you are,

1632
02:10:12,600 --> 02:10:14,887
whether it's a quarter-mile away

1633
02:10:15,920 --> 02:10:18,571
or halfway across the world,

1634
02:10:24,480 --> 02:10:28,242
the most important thing in life
will always be the people in this room.

1635
02:10:28,400 --> 02:10:30,562
Right here, right now.

1636
02:10:30,920 --> 02:10:32,251
Salud mi familia.

1637
02:10:32,400 --> 02:10:33,561
ALL: Salud.

1638
02:10:41,920 --> 02:10:43,524
DOM: You'll always be with me.

1639
02:10:45,800 --> 02:10:48,246
And you'll always be my brother.

1640
02:10:48,600 --> 02:10:52,020
How could we not talk about family
when family's all that we got?

1641
02:10:52,120 --> 02:10:54,980
Everything I went through
you were standing there by my side

1642
02:10:55,080 --> 02:10:57,765
And now you gonna be
there for the last ride

1643
02:11:00,480 --> 02:11:03,768
How could we not talk about family
when family's all that we got?

1644
02:11:04,040 --> 02:11:06,980
Everything I went through
you were standing there by my side

1645
02:11:07,080 --> 02:11:09,940
And now you gonna be
with me for the last ride

1646
02:11:10,040 --> 02:11:12,611
And now you gonna be
there for the last ride

1647
02:11:13,440 --> 02:11:15,124
I'll tell you

1648
02:11:16,040 --> 02:11:17,929
Yeah, we came a long way

1649
02:11:20,760 --> 02:11:22,410
I'll see you again
