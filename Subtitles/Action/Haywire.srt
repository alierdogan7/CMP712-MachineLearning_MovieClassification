3
00:01:54,448 --> 00:01:55,825
Shit.

4
00:02:22,351 --> 00:02:24,937
What the hell are you doing out here?

5
00:02:26,397 --> 00:02:28,190
I had to drive all night.

6
00:02:32,528 --> 00:02:33,696
I'm hungover as shit.

7
00:02:34,488 --> 00:02:36,323
And you're really starting
to cut into my vacation time,

8
00:02:36,407 --> 00:02:37,408
so can we go, please?

9
00:02:39,410 --> 00:02:40,536
We'll take my car. Come on.

10
00:02:40,619 --> 00:02:42,288
I don't think so.

11
00:02:45,583 --> 00:02:48,002
Why you making...
Why are you gonna make this difficult?

12
00:02:49,253 --> 00:02:52,882
What's difficult? He turns himself in.
Then it's easy.

13
00:02:54,008 --> 00:02:56,051
Turns himself in. Why would he do that?

14
00:02:58,304 --> 00:03:00,264
What exactly did he say I did?

15
00:03:00,347 --> 00:03:02,975
He didn't. He just said
to come pick you up.

16
00:03:03,058 --> 00:03:05,603
Nothing else? Nothing about Barcelona?

17
00:03:05,686 --> 00:03:06,937
No.

18
00:03:07,021 --> 00:03:10,024
Nothing about Dublin? Nothing about Paul?

19
00:03:16,238 --> 00:03:18,324
Hi. Can I get you something?

20
00:03:18,407 --> 00:03:19,909
- Need a minute?
- Y'all have beer?

21
00:03:20,826 --> 00:03:22,494
No, I wish.

22
00:03:22,578 --> 00:03:24,580
Just a coffee. Black.

23
00:03:28,667 --> 00:03:31,170
Okay, if you got something to say, say it.

24
00:03:31,253 --> 00:03:32,504
Aaron...

25
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:36,842
Have you even seen him?

26
00:03:38,219 --> 00:03:39,303
No.

27
00:03:52,024 --> 00:03:53,442
You're really not getting
in the car, are you?

28
00:03:53,525 --> 00:03:54,610
No.

29
00:03:59,615 --> 00:04:02,076
- Thank you.
- Have you got any...

30
00:04:04,787 --> 00:04:06,872
You need to get in the car, Mallory!

31
00:04:59,341 --> 00:05:01,510
- You got a car? You got a car?
- What?

32
00:05:02,011 --> 00:05:03,345
- Which one?
- This one.

33
00:05:03,429 --> 00:05:06,098
No, no, passenger side. Give me your keys.

34
00:05:06,181 --> 00:05:07,558
- Here.
- Keys!

35
00:05:14,565 --> 00:05:16,525
What's happening?
Where are you taking me?

36
00:05:16,608 --> 00:05:18,444
Put your seatbelt on.

37
00:05:21,905 --> 00:05:23,198
Shit!

38
00:05:26,327 --> 00:05:28,996
- What's your name?
- Scott.

39
00:05:29,079 --> 00:05:30,456
- I'm Mallory.
- Hi.

40
00:05:30,539 --> 00:05:33,542
You're gonna fix my arm while we drive.
Okay, Scott?

41
00:05:33,625 --> 00:05:34,835
Yeah.

42
00:05:46,722 --> 00:05:48,891
Okay. Here. Ready?

43
00:05:55,022 --> 00:05:58,484
- Okay.
- Now take two of the dry packets,

44
00:05:58,567 --> 00:06:01,528
put them on the one
you already have in place.

45
00:06:03,238 --> 00:06:04,948
- Yeah?
- Now take the tape,

46
00:06:05,032 --> 00:06:08,118
wrap it around the gauze
so it stays on my arm.

47
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:12,164
- Tight.
- Yeah.

48
00:06:12,247 --> 00:06:13,582
- Sorry.
- Couple times around.

49
00:06:13,665 --> 00:06:15,417
- Watch your arm.
- Yeah.

50
00:06:17,086 --> 00:06:19,505
Okay, now tape... Use
the scissors to cut it.

51
00:06:19,588 --> 00:06:22,341
- Okay.
- Okay.

52
00:06:22,424 --> 00:06:24,593
That should be good for now.

53
00:06:25,302 --> 00:06:27,554
Jesus Christ.

54
00:06:27,638 --> 00:06:30,641
- I'm hyperventilating.
- Scott.

55
00:06:30,724 --> 00:06:32,643
Thank you.

56
00:06:32,726 --> 00:06:33,769
Yeah, sure.

57
00:06:34,686 --> 00:06:36,855
So, who...

58
00:06:36,939 --> 00:06:38,482
Who was that guy?

59
00:06:38,565 --> 00:06:41,110
- I mean, honestly.
- Aaron?

60
00:06:41,193 --> 00:06:43,278
Someone I worked with.

61
00:06:43,362 --> 00:06:47,324
- Was he your... You know.
- No.

62
00:06:47,408 --> 00:06:48,617
No.

63
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:50,577
Where did you work with him?

64
00:06:50,661 --> 00:06:52,079
Barcelona.

65
00:06:54,456 --> 00:06:56,166
I...

66
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:59,169
I don't mean to, you know, get personal.

67
00:06:59,253 --> 00:07:01,880
- Are you in the drug business?
- No.

68
00:07:01,964 --> 00:07:04,425
Are you with the government?

69
00:07:04,508 --> 00:07:06,885
They contracted a company I work for.

70
00:07:06,969 --> 00:07:10,013
Private company.

71
00:07:10,097 --> 00:07:12,516
Wow. That's actually real?

72
00:07:12,599 --> 00:07:15,060
- Oh, yeah.
- That makes sense.

73
00:07:15,144 --> 00:07:16,728
So what do you do? What's your job?

74
00:07:20,315 --> 00:07:22,109
Barcelona. Separatists?

75
00:07:22,818 --> 00:07:24,778
No, no. It's clean.

76
00:07:24,862 --> 00:07:28,365
Negotiations broke down,
just need somebody to go and get the guy.

77
00:07:30,659 --> 00:07:31,994
Okay, whatever.

78
00:07:41,336 --> 00:07:42,921
<i>In four points,</i>

79
00:07:43,005 --> 00:07:45,757
<i>a better immunity language,
more access to intelligence,</i>

80
00:07:45,841 --> 00:07:47,634
<i>this fee structure is unacceptable.</i>

81
00:07:48,677 --> 00:07:49,678
Intelligence?

82
00:07:49,845 --> 00:07:53,348
Yeah, I need parity with Rodrigo here
and all his people.

83
00:07:53,515 --> 00:07:54,766
<i>Todos.</i>

84
00:07:56,143 --> 00:07:57,978
<i>You're with State, right?</i>

85
00:07:59,021 --> 00:08:00,355
Yes.

86
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:02,900
You like it?

87
00:08:03,817 --> 00:08:06,820
I like the idea of me doing my job

88
00:08:06,904 --> 00:08:09,740
more than the idea
of someone else doing my job.

89
00:08:09,823 --> 00:08:14,328
All right, now the immunity
language is as good as we can do.

90
00:08:14,411 --> 00:08:16,872
Fee structure... A number?

91
00:08:17,372 --> 00:08:19,333
Yeah, we need to adjust the overall payment

92
00:08:19,416 --> 00:08:22,336
in order that we can address things
like hazard bumps.

93
00:08:22,586 --> 00:08:26,632
I'll make a list.
But also how the installments are spaced.

94
00:08:26,715 --> 00:08:28,383
Fewer steps.

95
00:08:28,884 --> 00:08:30,636
Hi.

96
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:32,262
Hey.

97
00:08:32,346 --> 00:08:33,639
What, am I first?

98
00:08:33,722 --> 00:08:37,518
Yeah, Victor will be here at 4:30,
and Jamie's running late.

99
00:08:39,311 --> 00:08:41,355
<i>There's always a cash flow problem.</i>

100
00:08:42,564 --> 00:08:45,567
This is a short timetable, Kenneth.
Should I be nervous?

101
00:08:46,235 --> 00:08:47,402
If it will make you feel better,

102
00:08:47,486 --> 00:08:50,906
you can get the people
that did the Mexico job, Alex.

103
00:08:54,243 --> 00:08:56,662
Look, I know it's more efficient
if we wait for everybody to get here,

104
00:08:56,745 --> 00:09:00,874
but you want to start going through this?
I've got some ideas.

105
00:09:00,958 --> 00:09:05,295
You're right. It's more efficient
if we wait for everyone to get here.

106
00:09:08,257 --> 00:09:10,509
This should be fun.

107
00:09:10,592 --> 00:09:12,719
- Your kit's under your bed.
- Yours check out?

108
00:09:12,803 --> 00:09:16,515
- Good to go.
- I'll check later then, thank you.

109
00:09:16,598 --> 00:09:19,601
There's no smoking in here.

110
00:09:19,685 --> 00:09:21,103
Oh, okay.

111
00:09:23,939 --> 00:09:25,566
It's a phone.

112
00:09:27,484 --> 00:09:29,528
<i>Tell me about Kenneth.</i>

113
00:09:30,946 --> 00:09:33,073
What about him?

114
00:09:33,156 --> 00:09:36,159
How long have you worked together?

115
00:09:36,243 --> 00:09:37,786
Three years.

116
00:09:40,455 --> 00:09:42,416
Not so long.

117
00:09:42,499 --> 00:09:45,002
It is in this business.

118
00:09:45,085 --> 00:09:46,169
<i>You said four points.</i>

119
00:09:46,628 --> 00:09:49,006
You have Mallory Kane
as an essential element.

120
00:09:49,089 --> 00:09:50,048
Is that a problem?

121
00:09:50,132 --> 00:09:52,593
Not a good precedent for me,
for my business.

122
00:09:52,676 --> 00:09:54,636
Well, it doesn't work for us
if she's not involved.

123
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,305
She's not available.

124
00:09:57,306 --> 00:09:59,891
You mind if I call and check on that?

125
00:10:01,810 --> 00:10:04,021
I didn't realize
your interest extended to personnel.

126
00:10:04,104 --> 00:10:08,150
No, no. No, when somebody's good,
it comes to my attention.

127
00:10:08,233 --> 00:10:11,153
It's come to my attention
you're spreading yourself a little thin.

128
00:10:11,236 --> 00:10:13,655
Kenneth, I don't want your B-team.
She's value-added.

129
00:10:14,615 --> 00:10:16,742
Only reason we came to you.

130
00:10:19,036 --> 00:10:20,579
All right, I'll free her up.

131
00:10:20,662 --> 00:10:23,832
And I'll forego the hazard bumps
if you remove the essential element clause.

132
00:10:23,915 --> 00:10:26,752
- That important, huh?
- Do you want her in Barcelona or not?

133
00:11:34,736 --> 00:11:38,490
<i>Explain it to me then.
So I can understand it.</i>

134
00:11:38,907 --> 00:11:40,784
How are we not light?

135
00:11:41,535 --> 00:11:43,995
So we have a man in the car,
we got a man at the door.

136
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:45,831
Leaves you two to breach with.

137
00:11:46,498 --> 00:11:48,083
You're going hot on a hostage rescue.

138
00:11:48,166 --> 00:11:50,335
There's two rooms inside.

139
00:11:50,419 --> 00:11:52,337
So, the way I read it,

140
00:11:52,421 --> 00:11:55,799
you're either two men short in one room,
or you're one man short in each room.

141
00:11:57,342 --> 00:11:58,844
Anyone else think we're light?

142
00:12:00,053 --> 00:12:01,179
Us?

143
00:12:02,264 --> 00:12:03,432
No way.

144
00:12:04,349 --> 00:12:05,767
Good to go.

145
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:10,021
Good to go.

146
00:16:50,552 --> 00:16:52,303
- You tracking me with the names?
- Uh-huh.

147
00:16:52,387 --> 00:16:53,888
Repeat them.

148
00:16:55,056 --> 00:16:58,309
Mallory. Kenneth. Aaron.

149
00:16:58,393 --> 00:17:02,522
Jamie. Victor. Rodrigo.

150
00:17:02,605 --> 00:17:04,983
Barcelona.

151
00:17:05,066 --> 00:17:08,319
Hostage name.

152
00:17:08,403 --> 00:17:09,738
- Yang.
- Jiang.

153
00:17:09,821 --> 00:17:11,990
Shit. Jiang. Jiang.

154
00:17:13,950 --> 00:17:15,827
Don't speak. Walk in front of me.

155
00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:19,456
If I touch you, drop to your knees.
Do you understand?

156
00:18:03,958 --> 00:18:05,126
Done.

157
00:18:15,762 --> 00:18:17,847
They all gone?

158
00:18:17,931 --> 00:18:19,432
Yeah.

159
00:18:22,977 --> 00:18:26,523
When that guy took off,
why'd you chase him?

160
00:18:26,606 --> 00:18:29,567
We already had Jiang in the backseat.

161
00:18:29,651 --> 00:18:31,653
I don't like loose ends.

162
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:39,244
Is this your idea of relaxing?

163
00:18:39,327 --> 00:18:42,247
Wine and gun maintenance?

164
00:18:42,330 --> 00:18:45,166
There's another glass in the kitchen.

165
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:46,835
You gonna leave your name
and number afterwards?

166
00:18:48,545 --> 00:18:50,505
Why? You want it?

167
00:18:58,346 --> 00:19:00,473
You're gonna leave Kenneth?

168
00:19:02,851 --> 00:19:04,686
I left Kenneth six months ago.

169
00:19:06,271 --> 00:19:08,731
I meant the company.

170
00:19:08,815 --> 00:19:10,650
You're gonna leave the company?

171
00:19:10,733 --> 00:19:13,778
Company, I left an hour ago.

172
00:19:13,862 --> 00:19:15,363
How come?

173
00:19:17,365 --> 00:19:20,618
'Cause I'm not going down with the ship.

174
00:19:20,702 --> 00:19:22,120
Are you?

175
00:19:24,873 --> 00:19:27,625
If he's paying, yeah, I'm staying.

176
00:19:31,004 --> 00:19:33,423
If you stay...

177
00:19:33,506 --> 00:19:35,383
I don't know, maybe...

178
00:21:26,202 --> 00:21:27,912
Hi.

179
00:21:27,996 --> 00:21:29,956
What are you doing here?

180
00:21:30,873 --> 00:21:32,250
Gate key still worked.

181
00:21:32,333 --> 00:21:35,044
I didn't change everyone's
locks, just mine.

182
00:21:35,128 --> 00:21:36,671
Hey, I came by
'cause you weren't picking up.

183
00:21:36,754 --> 00:21:39,632
- I just landed.
- Yeah, two hours ago.

184
00:21:39,799 --> 00:21:42,593
I've been away for nine weeks.
That was my third job in a row.

185
00:21:42,677 --> 00:21:44,012
Give me a break.

186
00:21:44,095 --> 00:21:45,596
You wouldn't know what to do with a break.

187
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:47,348
Oh, you think you know me?

188
00:21:48,558 --> 00:21:50,018
Oh, I know you.

189
00:21:54,897 --> 00:21:57,233
I bet he's just like his books.

190
00:21:57,317 --> 00:21:58,943
- What?
- Your father.

191
00:21:59,027 --> 00:22:01,404
I bet he's just like the characters
in his books.

192
00:22:01,487 --> 00:22:02,488
How would you know?

193
00:22:02,572 --> 00:22:05,116
You've never read one of his books
and you've never met him.

194
00:22:05,199 --> 00:22:07,493
I'm just going off his photograph.

195
00:22:08,619 --> 00:22:10,288
What do you want?

196
00:22:11,748 --> 00:22:14,292
The usual. I have an assignment.

197
00:22:14,375 --> 00:22:17,128
Well, your timing sucks.
I haven't even unpacked yet.

198
00:22:17,211 --> 00:22:19,881
This'll take no time at all.
It's like a paid holiday.

199
00:22:19,964 --> 00:22:21,883
This will take no time
at all starting when?

200
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:24,802
Well, tonight.

201
00:22:25,428 --> 00:22:28,222
I mean, you would have to leave tonight.

202
00:22:29,307 --> 00:22:33,603
Well, if it is a paid holiday,
then it doesn't have to be me.

203
00:22:33,686 --> 00:22:35,396
I'm overqualified.

204
00:22:38,191 --> 00:22:41,194
The client has asked for you.

205
00:22:41,277 --> 00:22:44,655
Mallory, it's MI6.
It's a new in for me. I can expand.

206
00:22:44,739 --> 00:22:46,407
Yeah, sounds great. For you.

207
00:22:46,491 --> 00:22:47,992
Let me turn the volume up a little here.

208
00:22:48,076 --> 00:22:50,536
You probably heard me
mention the name Paul.

209
00:22:50,620 --> 00:22:52,705
Paul. Never, not once.

210
00:22:52,789 --> 00:22:56,209
Well, Paul, he's one of us,
but he's freelance.

211
00:22:56,292 --> 00:22:58,169
Actually, I was hoping
you might convince him to come aboard,

212
00:22:58,252 --> 00:22:59,420
but that's secondary.

213
00:22:59,504 --> 00:23:03,174
Paul has managed to get close
to a curious character named Studer,

214
00:23:03,257 --> 00:23:05,927
and our client
wants to take advantage of this.

215
00:23:06,010 --> 00:23:09,013
Studer is a French national
residing in Ireland.

216
00:23:09,097 --> 00:23:10,848
It's tricky, they want a light footprint.

217
00:23:10,932 --> 00:23:14,185
- Well, you've got Paul.
- I've got Paul, but Paul...

218
00:23:14,268 --> 00:23:17,897
Paul has presented himself
as one half of a power couple.

219
00:23:20,483 --> 00:23:21,943
This is your pitch?

220
00:23:22,151 --> 00:23:23,694
You want me to be eye candy?

221
00:23:23,778 --> 00:23:25,905
MI6 wants me to be eye candy?

222
00:23:26,155 --> 00:23:28,032
Mallory, you are the eye.

223
00:23:30,785 --> 00:23:32,578
I don't even know how to play that.

224
00:23:32,662 --> 00:23:34,914
I don't wear the dress.

225
00:23:34,997 --> 00:23:38,751
- Make Paul wear the dress.
- Well, I'll ask.

226
00:23:38,835 --> 00:23:42,922
Look, do this and then we'll go away
afterwards. We'll go to Majorca.

227
00:23:44,298 --> 00:23:47,301
- Majorca?
- Not like before, as friends.

228
00:23:47,385 --> 00:23:48,886
You can take a break.

229
00:23:49,929 --> 00:23:52,014
It's literally two days.

230
00:23:53,182 --> 00:23:54,809
Paul. That's Paul.

231
00:23:57,061 --> 00:23:59,939
You guys would be like the perfect couple.

232
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:04,652
So he'll know you.

233
00:24:07,488 --> 00:24:09,532
I need this to happen.

234
00:24:25,715 --> 00:24:27,341
- Hi.
- Hi.

235
00:24:33,598 --> 00:24:36,058
My better half. You look great.

236
00:25:48,631 --> 00:25:50,758
Mind if I freshen up first?

237
00:25:51,759 --> 00:25:54,178
Presumably, you'll need more time.

238
00:25:55,388 --> 00:25:56,889
Go ahead.

239
00:27:27,438 --> 00:27:28,856
All yours.

240
00:28:22,326 --> 00:28:25,871
Wow. You look fantastic.

241
00:28:28,582 --> 00:28:30,251
Can you zip me?

242
00:28:30,501 --> 00:28:31,919
Of course.

243
00:28:48,227 --> 00:28:51,105
- I'm leaving my gun.
- Me, too.

244
00:29:14,003 --> 00:29:15,504
Shall we?

245
00:30:00,090 --> 00:30:02,009
<i>Russborough
Remember Russborough.</i>

246
00:30:02,802 --> 00:30:04,386
Russborough.

247
00:30:04,470 --> 00:30:05,805
Who's Russborough?

248
00:30:05,888 --> 00:30:08,390
Not a who. A what. A place.

249
00:30:11,185 --> 00:30:14,104
It's where we were supposed to meet Studer.

250
00:30:32,957 --> 00:30:35,209
Not your natural habitat, is it?

251
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:48,931
Wrong side of the tracks.

252
00:30:49,014 --> 00:30:50,140
Kept getting into fights.

253
00:30:51,225 --> 00:30:52,726
Bleak future.

254
00:30:54,061 --> 00:30:56,397
Kenneth knows
how to put trouble to good use.

255
00:31:01,735 --> 00:31:03,237
I'm empty.

256
00:31:05,281 --> 00:31:08,492
- You have family?
- Both parents, still going strong.

257
00:31:08,576 --> 00:31:09,827
Teachers.

258
00:31:09,910 --> 00:31:13,497
Two brothers and a rather adorable niece.

259
00:31:13,581 --> 00:31:14,957
Whiskey.

260
00:31:16,834 --> 00:31:19,795
- They know what you do?
- No.

261
00:31:19,879 --> 00:31:21,547
I can never lie to my dad.

262
00:31:21,630 --> 00:31:23,090
Then he must worry about you.

263
00:31:23,173 --> 00:31:24,925
I tell him not to.

264
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:29,722
Still keeping tabs?

265
00:31:29,805 --> 00:31:31,974
I hate babysitting jobs.

266
00:31:36,353 --> 00:31:38,355
That guy just recognized me.

267
00:31:38,439 --> 00:31:40,983
- Who?
- Gray shirt, gray tie, goatee.

268
00:31:45,362 --> 00:31:47,197
- You sure?
- Yeah.

269
00:31:47,281 --> 00:31:48,449
Why would he know you?

270
00:31:48,532 --> 00:31:53,078
'Cause the last time I saw him,
I was in Baghdad in my hotel room.

271
00:31:53,162 --> 00:31:55,748
All right. Here comes our friend.

272
00:31:58,250 --> 00:32:01,629
Well, it's obvious you're newlyweds.

273
00:32:01,712 --> 00:32:04,131
Still talking to each other
instead of the other guests.

274
00:32:04,214 --> 00:32:06,592
- Oh, I'm sorry. Are we being rude?
- No, no.

275
00:32:06,675 --> 00:32:09,053
- Katie, Eric Studer.
- Hi.

276
00:32:09,136 --> 00:32:13,474
Listen, I had some brainwave.
What are you two doing afterwards?

277
00:32:13,682 --> 00:32:16,143
- Well, I don't know. You're jet-lagged, right?
- Mmm-hmm.

278
00:32:16,769 --> 00:32:19,396
No, I'm sorry. I mean tomorrow, this week.

279
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:20,856
No particular plans.

280
00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:23,317
- We were going back to London.
- London?

281
00:32:25,903 --> 00:32:27,071
I may have better than this.

282
00:32:27,821 --> 00:32:29,365
We're going to Saint Moritz.

283
00:32:29,448 --> 00:32:31,533
- "We"?
- Yeah, some friends.

284
00:32:31,617 --> 00:32:34,578
It'll be fun. We'll fly in,
put you up at a Suvretta.

285
00:32:34,662 --> 00:32:36,664
- Well...
- Do you ski?

286
00:32:36,747 --> 00:32:39,750
- Snowboard.
- These are the Alps, they're pretty steep.

287
00:32:39,833 --> 00:32:41,961
Like the prices. We'll discuss it.

288
00:32:42,044 --> 00:32:44,380
No, no, no discussion. We go.

289
00:32:44,463 --> 00:32:46,006
I'll send the itinerary to your hotel.

290
00:32:47,007 --> 00:32:48,425
Wheels up at 11:00.

291
00:32:49,510 --> 00:32:51,637
Okay? Okay?

292
00:32:56,767 --> 00:33:00,145
You locate Goatee. I'll take Studer.

293
00:33:05,359 --> 00:33:07,945
Myself and a few friends
are heading to a nice little village.

294
00:33:08,028 --> 00:33:09,029
Maybe you could come and join us.

295
00:33:10,239 --> 00:33:11,448
- Sounds good.
- Yeah?

296
00:33:11,532 --> 00:33:13,867
Bet you look good in white.
Fluffy, little bunny.

297
00:34:21,435 --> 00:34:23,854
I should think Sunday.

298
00:34:26,190 --> 00:34:27,608
Sunday?

299
00:34:30,069 --> 00:34:33,614
Maybe Saturday, if we're lucky.

300
00:34:37,451 --> 00:34:39,203
Then let's be lucky.

301
00:35:00,974 --> 00:35:01,934
Oh!

302
00:35:02,017 --> 00:35:04,061
- Mrs. Hillier.
- Hi Katie.

303
00:35:04,144 --> 00:35:06,772
Katie. You haven't promised to come skiing.

304
00:35:06,855 --> 00:35:09,399
I can't even find my way around here.

305
00:35:09,483 --> 00:35:12,069
Richard is in the other room.
I just left him.

306
00:35:12,152 --> 00:35:15,239
Well, actually, I was looking for the...

307
00:35:15,322 --> 00:35:19,159
Oh, they're in the back of the library.

308
00:35:19,243 --> 00:35:20,744
So much wine.

309
00:35:20,828 --> 00:35:22,496
- So much to look at.
- Yeah.

310
00:35:23,664 --> 00:35:27,417
You've only seen the inside.
I should show you the maze.

311
00:35:27,501 --> 00:35:29,586
Isn't it a little dark out there?

312
00:35:29,670 --> 00:35:31,088
Perfect time.

313
00:35:31,171 --> 00:35:33,423
I get claustrophobic, even in the daytime.

314
00:35:33,507 --> 00:35:36,218
No, the whole point is to relax
and lose yourself.

315
00:35:36,301 --> 00:35:38,512
I'll take a rain check.

316
00:35:39,096 --> 00:35:41,390
This is Ireland. Won't be long.

317
00:35:43,767 --> 00:35:46,812
And to find your way back,
retrace your steps.

318
00:37:04,932 --> 00:37:05,933
Fuck.

319
00:37:44,888 --> 00:37:46,473
Hi.

320
00:37:46,556 --> 00:37:49,309
<i>- Where are you?</i>
- In the bathroom.

321
00:37:49,393 --> 00:37:51,728
I'm not used to drinking so much.

322
00:37:51,812 --> 00:37:55,399
My friend from Baghdad has a date.
Well, a couple, actually.

323
00:37:55,482 --> 00:37:57,776
I think it's the paid-for kind.

324
00:37:57,859 --> 00:37:59,653
Where are you?

325
00:37:59,736 --> 00:38:01,613
<i>In the main room.</i>

326
00:38:01,697 --> 00:38:04,074
<i>I spoke to Studer briefly
and made our apologies,</i>

327
00:38:04,157 --> 00:38:06,243
<i>told him we'd discuss Saint Moritz
in the morning.</i>

328
00:38:07,828 --> 00:38:10,956
<i>I think we should get back to the hotel
and talk to Kenneth, don't you?</i>

329
00:39:06,928 --> 00:39:08,055
Thank you.

330
00:40:41,731 --> 00:40:43,900
Mallory, you're in way over your head.

331
00:40:44,734 --> 00:40:45,777
Think this through.

332
00:40:45,861 --> 00:40:48,613
You've been out of control
since you've arrived.

333
00:40:48,697 --> 00:40:50,157
You need to call Kenneth.

334
00:43:05,792 --> 00:43:08,003
Excuse me. I should take this.

335
00:43:09,129 --> 00:43:10,463
Pauly?

336
00:43:11,965 --> 00:43:14,968
So, is the divorce final?

337
00:43:17,637 --> 00:43:19,264
<i>Paul, are you there?</i>

338
00:43:24,311 --> 00:43:25,353
Mallory.

339
00:43:42,662 --> 00:43:45,332
<i>- Hello.
- Dad, it's Mal.</i>

340
00:43:45,415 --> 00:43:49,127
<i>Things are kind of screwed up here
and I need to come home.</i>

341
00:43:49,210 --> 00:43:52,922
<i>It may take me a couple of days,
depending on what happens.</i>

342
00:43:53,006 --> 00:43:55,508
Don't worry about me,
you just get here as quick as you can.

343
00:43:55,842 --> 00:43:58,094
I'll try.

344
00:43:58,178 --> 00:43:59,179
Keep your eyes open.

345
00:44:00,347 --> 00:44:03,183
I haven't shut my eyes since you were born.

346
00:44:03,266 --> 00:44:04,267
Just be careful.

347
00:44:05,226 --> 00:44:07,020
<i>And watch your six.</i>

348
00:44:08,772 --> 00:44:10,690
I will

349
00:44:10,774 --> 00:44:12,150
I'll see you at the house.

350
00:48:18,605 --> 00:48:21,649
- Can I get this cell phone?
- It's €42.50.

351
00:48:27,572 --> 00:48:29,032
There you go.

352
00:53:50,937 --> 00:53:54,774
Come on, let's go, let's go.
Get over there. Let's go. Come on.

353
00:54:32,603 --> 00:54:35,439
<i>Rodrigo. Hi, it's Mallory Kane.</i>

354
00:54:35,523 --> 00:54:37,566
<i>- Mallory Kane.
- I hope it's not too late.</i>

355
00:54:37,650 --> 00:54:39,986
<i>I just landed in New York.
Do you have a minute?</i>

356
00:54:40,069 --> 00:54:42,613
<i>I just felt like I had to call.
I was going over my report,</i>

357
00:54:42,697 --> 00:54:46,492
and I realized
I never thanked you for all your help.

358
00:54:46,575 --> 00:54:51,539
<i>It's really not necessary.
It's not even customary.</i>

359
00:54:51,622 --> 00:54:52,707
Well, it should be.

360
00:54:53,291 --> 00:54:57,044
<i>But I just wanted to verify one thing
with you before I actually file my report.</i>

361
00:54:57,503 --> 00:55:02,133
Was it you or Kenneth
who sold the Barcelona job to Studer?

362
00:55:47,303 --> 00:55:48,429
Rodrigo.

363
00:55:48,512 --> 00:55:50,473
<i>Que paso?</i>
What are you working so late for?

364
00:55:50,556 --> 00:55:52,266
It's what, past 8:00, your time?

365
00:55:52,558 --> 00:55:55,811
<i>Yeah.
Listen, Mallory Kane just called me.</i>

366
00:55:56,896 --> 00:55:58,939
<i>I thought you should know.</i>

367
00:56:00,900 --> 00:56:03,194
- Wait, she called you at home?
- Yes.

368
00:56:05,154 --> 00:56:07,156
Was that a nice conversation?

369
00:56:07,740 --> 00:56:12,203
Yeah, yeah, very nice.
Brief, but very nice. Yeah.

370
00:56:12,745 --> 00:56:15,206
She thanked me for my assistance.

371
00:56:16,999 --> 00:56:19,210
<i>She still in Dublin?</i>

372
00:56:19,293 --> 00:56:21,837
She said she just landed in New York.

373
00:56:21,921 --> 00:56:23,672
<i>Good.</i>

374
00:56:23,756 --> 00:56:28,302
<i>Good. Well,
why don't you stay off your house line,</i>

375
00:56:28,677 --> 00:56:33,057
and I wouldn't go outside
till I call you back.

376
00:56:33,140 --> 00:56:35,142
Or your family.

377
00:56:35,226 --> 00:56:37,228
<i>- I see. Thank you</i>
- All right.

378
00:56:37,311 --> 00:56:39,021
Rodrigo, you take care, all right?

379
00:56:39,105 --> 00:56:40,856
<i>Yeah, sure. Bye.</i>

380
00:56:51,700 --> 00:56:55,121
Tyler, the activity log
for the number that I just sent you,

381
00:56:55,204 --> 00:56:59,291
I want you to connect me
to the last incoming call.

382
00:57:06,257 --> 00:57:07,258
Who is this?

383
00:57:07,508 --> 00:57:10,177
Mallory, hi. My name is Alex Coblenz.

384
00:57:10,261 --> 00:57:15,057
I was with Kenneth and Rodrigo
when the Barcelona deal went down.

385
00:57:15,141 --> 00:57:17,601
<i>Who else besides you knows about this?</i>

386
00:57:17,685 --> 00:57:21,564
No, only the people
that need to know in order to fix it.

387
00:57:21,647 --> 00:57:23,774
The people who thought up Barcelona.

388
00:57:23,858 --> 00:57:26,444
<i>Mallory, we did not think up Barcelona.</i>

389
00:57:26,527 --> 00:57:29,405
No, you just helped.

390
00:57:29,488 --> 00:57:31,907
- Can you bring me in?
<i>- We can, yes,</i>

391
00:57:31,991 --> 00:57:35,327
<i>but I'd like you
to keep doing what you're doing.</i>

392
00:57:35,411 --> 00:57:40,166
We want you to bust Kenneth's budget,
you know, see how he reacts.

393
00:57:40,249 --> 00:57:43,669
Everyone he reaches out to,
you know, it's like another layer.

394
00:57:43,752 --> 00:57:45,588
<i>What do you think he's into?</i>

395
00:57:45,671 --> 00:57:48,591
Well, whatever it is,
Kenneth is not at the top.

396
00:57:49,300 --> 00:57:54,430
<i>It's just not possible. We like Studer.
We think there's something there.</i>

397
00:57:54,513 --> 00:57:56,557
You gotta get me off the watch list.

398
00:57:56,807 --> 00:57:58,851
Mallory, I cannot do that.

399
00:57:58,934 --> 00:58:01,020
You know, while Kenneth's watching,
he'll know we spoke.

400
00:58:02,855 --> 00:58:07,443
<i>I promise I 'II do everything I can
to convince him to meet you.</i>

401
00:58:07,526 --> 00:58:09,653
<i>Then you can find out
what we both want to know,</i>

402
00:58:09,737 --> 00:58:12,448
<i>which is why this is happening.</i>

403
00:58:14,658 --> 00:58:17,244
I got a fake ID in London,
came in through Canada,

404
00:58:17,328 --> 00:58:19,246
and crossed the border.

405
00:58:19,330 --> 00:58:23,626
Coblenz helped me set up a meeting
with Kenneth, but Aaron showed up instead.

406
00:58:23,709 --> 00:58:25,461
And then I met you.

407
00:58:27,755 --> 00:58:29,924
There's some water in my backpack.

408
00:58:30,007 --> 00:58:31,383
Have some.

409
00:58:33,886 --> 00:58:36,222
Don't mind if I do. Thank you.

410
00:58:38,557 --> 00:58:41,352
- You want some?
- Yeah, please.

411
00:58:41,435 --> 00:58:43,729
- Help me.
- Yeah, sorry.

412
00:58:45,648 --> 00:58:47,733
- Good?
- Yeah. Thanks.

413
00:58:57,576 --> 00:59:00,037
What's going on here?

414
00:59:00,120 --> 00:59:01,830
Random road check?

415
00:59:02,498 --> 00:59:05,417
All right. Hold On.

416
00:59:16,887 --> 00:59:17,888
Yep.

417
00:59:31,944 --> 00:59:33,112
Jesus!

418
00:59:39,201 --> 00:59:40,202
Jeez!

419
00:59:46,792 --> 00:59:49,128
I just got this
car, like, a week ago.

420
00:59:49,211 --> 00:59:50,337
Yeah, Well...

421
01:00:02,099 --> 01:00:03,726
Whoops, more LEOs.

422
01:00:05,227 --> 01:00:06,687
What's a LEO?

423
01:00:07,896 --> 01:00:09,982
Law enforcement officers.

424
01:00:30,461 --> 01:00:31,920
Shit!

425
01:00:32,004 --> 01:00:33,839
Shit! Watch the car!

426
01:00:40,971 --> 01:00:43,557
That was nice. That was nice.
That was really bad.

427
01:00:43,641 --> 01:00:44,933
I thought
that was gonna be really bad for a second.

428
01:00:45,017 --> 01:00:46,977
I thought I was gonna have a heart attack.
Oh, my God.

429
01:00:47,061 --> 01:00:49,897
Jesus Christ! You are a great driver!

430
01:00:59,615 --> 01:01:00,949
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, are you?

431
01:01:01,033 --> 01:01:03,869
Yeah. Oh, my God! There's
a deer in the car.

432
01:01:03,952 --> 01:01:05,788
- Jesus...
- Yeah, I know.

433
01:01:13,462 --> 01:01:15,798
- Should we run?
- No. Don't.

434
01:01:15,881 --> 01:01:17,549
We've done enough.

435
01:01:25,057 --> 01:01:26,725
Show me your hands.

436
01:01:26,809 --> 01:01:28,018
Freeze! Don't move!

437
01:01:28,102 --> 01:01:30,062
You, behind
the car, step forward!

438
01:01:30,145 --> 01:01:32,731
Hands in the air! Turn around!

439
01:01:32,815 --> 01:01:33,857
Turn around, punk!

440
01:01:39,405 --> 01:01:41,323
<i>Unit three.</i>

441
01:01:42,282 --> 01:01:43,659
OFFICER 13 Unit three.

442
01:01:43,742 --> 01:01:48,664
<i>Proceed with suspects to 2345 Clearview.</i>

443
01:01:48,747 --> 01:01:53,043
<i>Repeat, 2345 Clearview, and hold.</i>

444
01:01:53,127 --> 01:01:56,130
<i>Federal agents en route.</i>

445
01:01:56,213 --> 01:01:57,715
Unit three, copy.

446
01:01:57,798 --> 01:02:00,843
You must have stepped in something.

447
01:02:00,926 --> 01:02:02,261
OFFICER 11 Yeah.

448
01:02:04,221 --> 01:02:06,682
Excuse me, Deputy Cross?

449
01:02:06,765 --> 01:02:08,726
Deputy Cross? Hi.

450
01:02:08,809 --> 01:02:12,104
You were in the Corps, right?
I was a devil dog.

451
01:02:12,187 --> 01:02:15,441
Listen, this might sound a little funny.

452
01:02:15,524 --> 01:02:18,193
I'm a private contractor
on a 10-24 operation,

453
01:02:18,277 --> 01:02:20,571
and these guys you're about to meet
are not federal agents.

454
01:02:21,405 --> 01:02:23,407
I mean, follow your protocol and all,

455
01:02:23,490 --> 01:02:25,367
but you should really keep your distance.

456
01:02:25,451 --> 01:02:29,747
Use your radio and your loudspeakers
in order to confirm who these guys aren't.

457
01:02:29,830 --> 01:02:31,540
Really, I'm not joking.

458
01:02:31,623 --> 01:02:34,960
You can look me up,
a New Mexico license for Mallory Kane.

459
01:02:35,043 --> 01:02:36,879
I'll confirm the number.

460
01:02:36,962 --> 01:02:39,006
You need to sit back.

461
01:02:39,089 --> 01:02:42,384
Look, an innocent civilian will be killed
if you do not listen to me.

462
01:02:42,468 --> 01:02:45,846
Hey, Wonder Woman, you said your piece.
Now sit back and shut up.

463
01:03:49,034 --> 01:03:51,245
- Jesus, are you...
- Get down!

464
01:04:01,380 --> 01:04:04,424
Just keep your head down
a few more minutes and you're out of this.

465
01:04:04,508 --> 01:04:07,761
Great, great. How are you gonna
get out of this, may I ask?

466
01:04:07,845 --> 01:04:11,056
I'll just dump the car.
I'll find another ride. I'll catch a bus.

467
01:04:11,139 --> 01:04:12,724
Great, good luck with that.

468
01:04:12,808 --> 01:04:14,893
I can't wait till Coblenz hears about this.

469
01:04:14,977 --> 01:04:17,229
- What is that?
- Listen, when we split,

470
01:04:17,312 --> 01:04:19,189
I'm gonna give you a number to call.

471
01:04:19,273 --> 01:04:22,484
I was supposed to be
sleeping in late today,

472
01:04:22,568 --> 01:04:24,444
not getting carjacked.

473
01:04:24,528 --> 01:04:25,863
Scott, you still with me?

474
01:04:25,946 --> 01:04:29,241
- Yeah, yeah. Yeah, a number.
- Just tell them everything.

475
01:04:29,324 --> 01:04:32,369
Tell the police, too,
tell them everything I've told you, okay?

476
01:04:32,452 --> 01:04:34,329
- Yeah, okay.
- You did great.

477
01:04:34,413 --> 01:04:36,915
- You're gonna be fine.
- Yeah. Okay.

478
01:04:37,833 --> 01:04:41,086
This is the trouble
with the private sector, Kenneth.

479
01:04:41,169 --> 01:04:44,423
You got that macho takedown,
but where's the due diligence?

480
01:04:44,506 --> 01:04:45,757
Where's the follow-through?

481
01:04:47,384 --> 01:04:50,554
Now, we got ourselves a real twizzler here.

482
01:04:50,679 --> 01:04:53,348
And for eight figures,
I don't accept excuses,

483
01:04:53,432 --> 01:04:56,518
explanations or rationales.

484
01:04:56,602 --> 01:04:59,062
Now I don't even know
why the hell you're standing here.

485
01:04:59,146 --> 01:05:02,441
You should be in her father's living room,
explaining to him,

486
01:05:02,524 --> 01:05:06,612
telling him that his daughter
is a fugitive with ties to terrorists.

487
01:05:06,695 --> 01:05:09,907
That she killed a man in cold blood
in Dublin and killed four cops.

488
01:05:11,283 --> 01:05:12,784
You tell him.

489
01:05:13,827 --> 01:05:15,120
Show him.

490
01:05:16,455 --> 01:05:17,956
<i>He'll come at you
like he's government,</i>

491
01:05:18,040 --> 01:05:19,750
<i>make me seem like a monster.</i>

492
01:05:20,709 --> 01:05:23,211
Play like you're shocked.

493
01:05:23,295 --> 01:05:26,089
The guy with the broken arm, Aaron,

494
01:05:26,173 --> 01:05:27,341
get in his head.

495
01:05:27,424 --> 01:05:29,509
Keep bringing up Barcelona.

496
01:05:29,593 --> 01:05:31,803
Get him arguing with Kenneth.

497
01:05:31,887 --> 01:05:33,889
Kenneth.

498
01:05:33,972 --> 01:05:37,559
My fault. I should've seen that one coming.

499
01:05:37,643 --> 01:05:39,728
You did.

500
01:05:39,811 --> 01:05:44,066
Hold up a sec, Mal.
Let's analyze your options.

501
01:05:44,149 --> 01:05:46,485
We could leave right now, disappear.

502
01:05:46,568 --> 01:05:49,655
We could be in Buenos Aires
this time tomorrow.

503
01:05:52,824 --> 01:05:54,868
I'm not gonna run any more.

504
01:05:58,372 --> 01:06:02,417
<i>Mr. Kane, these were taken
by the police. They're pretty graphic.</i>

505
01:06:04,586 --> 01:06:06,922
<i>Her prints are all over the room.</i>

506
01:06:07,005 --> 01:06:10,717
<i>The security video shows them
coming in together and her leaving alone.</i>

507
01:06:10,801 --> 01:06:14,471
<i>The guest downstairs
complained about the noise.</i>

508
01:06:14,554 --> 01:06:16,264
<i>Paul fought back,</i>

509
01:06:16,348 --> 01:06:18,684
<i>but she obviously had
the element of surprise in her favor.</i>

510
01:06:18,767 --> 01:06:22,020
<i>She choked him out
and she shot him in the head.</i>

511
01:06:23,689 --> 01:06:27,734
Add that to the four police,
and that is five dead in three days.

512
01:06:28,443 --> 01:06:32,155
- Where was she last seen?
- Upstate New York, 36 hours ago.

513
01:06:32,239 --> 01:06:35,659
- Was she alone?
- No, she was with a boy, 19.

514
01:06:35,742 --> 01:06:38,495
She grabbed him at gunpoint.
Used him as a ride and a shield,

515
01:06:38,578 --> 01:06:41,456
so we can add aggravated kidnapping
to the murder charges.

516
01:06:43,834 --> 01:06:45,002
No, I'm sorry.

517
01:06:45,877 --> 01:06:48,422
This doesn't sound like my daughter.

518
01:06:51,383 --> 01:06:54,052
She ever mention the name Kenneth?

519
01:06:54,136 --> 01:06:55,595
No.

520
01:06:56,388 --> 01:06:58,140
Really?

521
01:06:58,223 --> 01:07:00,684
He runs the company she worked for.

522
01:07:00,767 --> 01:07:04,855
They were in a relationship for over a year,
and yet she never mentioned him to you?

523
01:07:06,231 --> 01:07:07,649
What do you know about her?

524
01:07:08,191 --> 01:07:09,985
Really, at the end of the day?

525
01:07:10,694 --> 01:07:11,695
I raised her.

526
01:07:12,070 --> 01:07:14,823
<i>And denial is
a very effective parenting tool.</i>

527
01:07:14,906 --> 01:07:16,366
<i>She was a Marine.
She does something,</i>

528
01:07:16,450 --> 01:07:17,909
<i>there must be a reason for it.</i>

529
01:07:17,993 --> 01:07:21,663
<i>Mr. Kane, she is no longer</i> a <i>Marine
She is</i> a <i>murderer.</i>

530
01:07:21,747 --> 01:07:24,291
<i>She is a public threat.
She's on a killing spree.</i>

531
01:07:25,709 --> 01:07:28,712
Now, you are the only person
that she can trust.

532
01:07:28,795 --> 01:07:31,089
You're gonna help bring her in
before she kills again.

533
01:07:31,173 --> 01:07:33,759
Without you, she won't survive this.

534
01:07:45,145 --> 01:07:46,938
I heard from her.

535
01:07:48,607 --> 01:07:49,608
Ten days ago.

536
01:07:50,275 --> 01:07:53,195
She texted me,
said she was going to Barcelona.

537
01:07:53,278 --> 01:07:55,822
What did she say exactly?

538
01:07:55,906 --> 01:07:58,784
"Going to Barcelona. Call you after."

539
01:07:58,867 --> 01:08:00,869
Six words, that's it?

540
01:08:00,952 --> 01:08:02,412
Well, it was enough for me.

541
01:08:02,496 --> 01:08:05,040
And she didn't mention Dublin?
She didn't say anything about this?

542
01:08:05,123 --> 01:08:06,208
No.

543
01:08:09,127 --> 01:08:10,712
Who was he?

544
01:08:10,796 --> 01:08:13,673
He was an agent with British Intelligence.

545
01:08:14,633 --> 01:08:18,595
Now, whether this was a murder-for-hire
or a crime of passion, we don't know.

546
01:08:18,678 --> 01:08:20,138
Well, she would never kill someone
for money.

547
01:08:20,222 --> 01:08:21,431
There must be an explanation.

548
01:08:21,515 --> 01:08:24,351
Didn't this all start after Barcelona?

549
01:08:24,434 --> 01:08:26,728
Maybe that has something to do
with why she's a fugitive.

550
01:08:26,812 --> 01:08:28,230
Something must have happened there.

551
01:08:29,481 --> 01:08:31,233
- Aaron.
- I'm on it.

552
01:08:38,573 --> 01:08:41,743
It's overseas. Prepaid phone.
Yeah, that's gotta be her.

553
01:08:41,827 --> 01:08:43,662
Wait for the track.

554
01:08:44,663 --> 01:08:45,747
Go.

555
01:08:45,831 --> 01:08:47,249
Talk to her.

556
01:08:50,335 --> 01:08:51,837
Mallory.

557
01:08:51,920 --> 01:08:55,048
<i>Dad, don't say anything.
Give Kenneth the phone.</i>

558
01:08:55,841 --> 01:08:58,885
Just be careful.

559
01:09:07,769 --> 01:09:11,273
Mallory, I hope you've decided
to turn yourself in.

560
01:09:11,356 --> 01:09:13,608
<i>You can tell me right now
why you sold me out</i>

561
01:09:13,692 --> 01:09:15,318
<i>and what you're into with Studer,</i>

562
01:09:15,402 --> 01:09:16,903
<i>or you can tell me in ten minutes,</i>

563
01:09:16,987 --> 01:09:19,698
<i>when I have my hands around your throat.</i>

564
01:09:20,323 --> 01:09:22,242
You need to think for a minute, Mallory.

565
01:09:22,325 --> 01:09:23,618
You need to stop pretending

566
01:09:23,702 --> 01:09:26,329
you can achieve a desirable outcome
in this situation,

567
01:09:26,663 --> 01:09:29,124
and turn yourself in.

568
01:09:29,207 --> 01:09:31,835
Do it for the sake of your father.

569
01:09:31,918 --> 01:09:33,670
<i>Surrender now if you wanna live.</i>

570
01:09:33,753 --> 01:09:36,464
I'm sorry, Mallory, that's not possible.

571
01:09:36,548 --> 01:09:38,675
<i>All right, Kenneth. We'll do it your way.</i>

572
01:09:38,758 --> 01:09:40,802
She's...

573
01:09:40,886 --> 01:09:42,137
She's here.

574
01:09:42,387 --> 01:09:43,388
Here? Where?

575
01:09:43,513 --> 01:09:46,975
In the house. Track says she's in the house.
Go, now. You sit down.

576
01:09:47,058 --> 01:09:48,727
You knew about this?
You knew she was here?

577
01:09:48,810 --> 01:09:53,523
No. I told you, I haven't heard from her
since she texted me.

578
01:09:53,607 --> 01:09:54,900
Kenny.

579
01:09:57,903 --> 01:09:59,988
Do we need to have a conversation
about Barcelona?

580
01:10:00,071 --> 01:10:01,865
Aaron, you were in Barcelona.
You know what happened.

581
01:10:01,948 --> 01:10:03,366
We rescued a man.

582
01:10:03,450 --> 01:10:06,369
- Did we?
- Aaron, you need to focus right now.

583
01:10:06,453 --> 01:10:08,330
You were in Barcelona?

584
01:10:09,581 --> 01:10:12,459
I'm confused.
She works for a private company.

585
01:10:17,464 --> 01:10:19,758
Breaker box. Get on it. Lock the doors.

586
01:10:19,841 --> 01:10:22,344
- What if she's inside?
- Then we'll pressure-cook her.

587
01:10:22,427 --> 01:10:23,678
We'll find her.

588
01:10:23,762 --> 01:10:25,013
I don't mean to tell you your job,

589
01:10:25,096 --> 01:10:28,308
but isn't there someone
you should be calling, Agent Milgrom?

590
01:10:28,391 --> 01:10:31,144
Other officers of the law, to bring help?

591
01:10:31,228 --> 01:10:33,104
We can handle this.

592
01:10:33,438 --> 01:10:35,065
- Go.
- I got this. Watch him.

593
01:11:16,356 --> 01:11:17,607
- Did you hear that?
- Yeah.

594
01:11:17,691 --> 01:11:19,025
Get on it.

595
01:11:26,491 --> 01:11:28,994
Tom's down. IED in the breaker box.

596
01:11:29,077 --> 01:11:30,996
- We need to get to the car.
- I'm not sure if that'll help.

597
01:11:31,079 --> 01:11:32,205
But she can't outrun a car.

598
01:11:32,831 --> 01:11:33,999
<i>She can if it's not running.</i>

599
01:11:34,082 --> 01:11:35,625
<i>Well, then let's find out.</i>

600
01:11:35,792 --> 01:11:37,711
Be my guest. Go ahead.

601
01:11:41,548 --> 01:11:43,383
You should see this.

602
01:11:45,844 --> 01:11:48,013
Who did that? Her?

603
01:11:48,722 --> 01:11:50,974
<i>- Yeah, probably. That's why we're here.</i>
<i>- Doesn't make any sense, man.</i>

604
01:11:51,057 --> 01:11:53,518
<i>- Aaron, let's not discuss this right now.
- No. We're gonna talk about it.</i>

605
01:11:53,601 --> 01:11:54,728
<i>- Calm down.</i>
- Don't tell me to calm down.

606
01:11:54,811 --> 01:11:56,896
- What did you do?
- I did what I was contracted to do.

607
01:11:56,980 --> 01:11:58,565
We were contracted to rescue somebody.

608
01:11:59,149 --> 01:12:00,984
<i>It seems to me, you auctioned
him off and tried to burn her.</i>

609
01:12:01,067 --> 01:12:02,444
<i>- That's not what happened.</i>
<i>- Really?</i>

610
01:12:02,527 --> 01:12:03,862
<i>- No, I can explain.</i>
<i>- Then explain it,</i>

611
01:12:03,945 --> 01:12:05,530
and try really hard.

612
01:12:12,037 --> 01:12:14,080
Don't give me a reason.

613
01:12:34,726 --> 01:12:36,561
No, just go help her!

614
01:12:57,540 --> 01:12:59,376
- Kenneth!
- He's gone.

615
01:13:34,702 --> 01:13:36,329
You better run.

616
01:14:00,019 --> 01:14:01,688
I'm So stupid.

617
01:14:11,156 --> 01:14:14,576
Can't believe I met you a week ago.

618
01:14:14,659 --> 01:14:16,661
Eight, eight days.

619
01:14:19,747 --> 01:14:22,375
We were in Barcelona eight days ago?

620
01:14:26,337 --> 01:14:29,007
I'm trying to focus on my breathing.

621
01:15:28,733 --> 01:15:29,734
<i>Mal?</i>

622
01:15:31,903 --> 01:15:33,071
Mal?

623
01:15:35,698 --> 01:15:37,075
Sweetheart?

624
01:15:49,420 --> 01:15:50,797
It's okay.

625
01:16:33,840 --> 01:16:35,925
In the auction business,
they have an expression

626
01:16:36,009 --> 01:16:38,636
called "the halo effect."

627
01:16:38,720 --> 01:16:40,763
You know what that is?

628
01:16:40,972 --> 01:16:44,350
It's when an object or work of art
is more desirable

629
01:16:44,434 --> 01:16:46,686
because of its prior ownership.

630
01:16:48,730 --> 01:16:52,191
Very rare when it happens, you know?
Maybe once in a lifetime.

631
01:16:53,359 --> 01:16:55,486
Gotta catch it when you can.

632
01:16:58,990 --> 01:17:02,035
Look, I got plenty of
drama in my own office.

633
01:17:02,118 --> 01:17:03,828
You were his contact.

634
01:17:03,911 --> 01:17:06,080
No, I was his employer.

635
01:17:06,164 --> 01:17:08,499
There's a very big difference, trust me.

636
01:17:08,583 --> 01:17:10,084
There's only one person I trust.

637
01:17:10,168 --> 01:17:12,587
Your dad, yes. He okay?

638
01:17:12,670 --> 01:17:16,007
He's fine. Thanks for cleaning up.

639
01:17:16,090 --> 01:17:21,346
Well, I told you you can have Kenneth
alone at the house. I promised you that.

640
01:17:21,429 --> 01:17:24,599
It should at least make me a colleague,

641
01:17:24,682 --> 01:17:26,726
if not a friend.

642
01:17:26,809 --> 01:17:29,187
And if something happens to you?

643
01:17:29,270 --> 01:17:31,105
Well, then you're screwed.

644
01:17:31,189 --> 01:17:32,982
One friend's not a lot.

645
01:17:33,066 --> 01:17:35,693
It depends on who it is.

646
01:17:35,777 --> 01:17:39,572
- And the kid who helped me?
- We'll fix the ding in his car.

647
01:17:40,865 --> 01:17:43,743
Okay, I will buy him a new car.

648
01:17:44,869 --> 01:17:47,205
What is that, an incentive?

649
01:17:48,581 --> 01:17:50,375
It could be.

650
01:17:50,458 --> 01:17:51,959
You gotta admit

651
01:17:52,043 --> 01:17:54,671
that this type of life appeals
to a certain kind of person.

652
01:17:54,754 --> 01:17:58,841
You know? You're off the grid,
you never answer to anybody.

653
01:17:59,926 --> 01:18:02,387
Always looking over your shoulder.

654
01:18:03,388 --> 01:18:07,725
And you got Kenneth out there
with all his contacts.

655
01:18:08,851 --> 01:18:10,812
Makes you pretty vulnerable.

656
01:18:11,270 --> 01:18:13,022
Where is he?

657
01:18:13,940 --> 01:18:18,403
Well, Mallory, that is a valuable piece
of information, isn't it?

658
01:18:20,530 --> 01:18:22,740
<i>We think he's crossed the border.</i>

659
01:18:22,824 --> 01:18:25,368
<i>Possible sightings in Veracruz.</i>

660
01:18:26,077 --> 01:18:30,248
But what would be nice to know
is what he gave everything up for.

661
01:18:33,292 --> 01:18:36,170
So we're back to the government option.

662
01:18:36,254 --> 01:18:39,132
Pays less, taxes are taken out.

663
01:18:39,215 --> 01:18:41,968
But you get your good name back.

664
01:18:51,811 --> 01:18:53,563
I'll let you know.

665
01:18:55,356 --> 01:18:57,483
- When?
- When I have him.

666
01:19:28,639 --> 01:19:29,891
Yes?

667
01:19:31,309 --> 01:19:32,310
Kenneth.

668
01:19:37,023 --> 01:19:38,775
He's not available.

669
01:19:58,586 --> 01:20:00,254
I'm good.

670
01:20:00,338 --> 01:20:02,215
Just going for a walk.

671
01:21:57,455 --> 01:21:58,623
Fuck!

672
01:22:02,793 --> 01:22:04,503
Who did I extract in Barcelona?

673
01:22:04,587 --> 01:22:07,131
You mean who did you kill in Dublin?

674
01:22:07,214 --> 01:22:09,550
Tide's coming in.

675
01:22:11,093 --> 01:22:12,803
It was a journalist, a dissident.

676
01:22:13,804 --> 01:22:16,557
A dissident journalist,
a scientist, what does it matter?

677
01:22:16,641 --> 01:22:18,392
It mattered to someone. Who?

678
01:22:20,603 --> 01:22:24,106
You were excited on the phone.
What do you have?

679
01:22:25,024 --> 01:22:27,693
A unique alignment of conditions.

680
01:22:29,654 --> 01:22:33,407
I know this man, Jiang,
has been a problem for you,

681
01:22:33,491 --> 01:22:36,619
leaking information and so forth.

682
01:22:36,702 --> 01:22:38,788
Restricting your movements.

683
01:22:40,247 --> 01:22:43,584
I also know this Kane girl
is about to leave her employer

684
01:22:43,668 --> 01:22:46,671
and take all his business with her.

685
01:22:46,754 --> 01:22:49,507
Which he won't survive.

686
01:22:49,590 --> 01:22:51,801
So when I get word that.

687
01:22:51,884 --> 01:22:54,762
Jiang has been staying
in a safe house in Barcelona,

688
01:22:56,138 --> 01:22:58,808
<i>I see an opportunity for everyone</i>

689
01:23:00,601 --> 01:23:03,020
<i>to transcend their circumstances.</i>

690
01:23:05,106 --> 01:23:09,610
You mean hire the girl to rescue Jiang?

691
01:23:09,694 --> 01:23:12,905
And I deliver him to you.

692
01:23:12,989 --> 01:23:15,032
<i>The story will be that she's gone rogue.</i>

693
01:23:15,366 --> 01:23:16,784
Sold out on the Barcelona job

694
01:23:16,867 --> 01:23:18,953
and murdered a man
for money at Russborough.

695
01:23:20,037 --> 01:23:21,455
Resistance?

696
01:23:21,539 --> 01:23:23,457
He won't be in a position to.

697
01:23:23,541 --> 01:23:24,959
Put a bullet in him,

698
01:23:25,042 --> 01:23:28,129
plant the broach on him, and then kill her
when you get back to the hotel.

699
01:23:29,130 --> 01:23:31,215
- Self-defense.
- Of course.

700
01:23:35,302 --> 01:23:39,557
I'm assuming the motive of everyone
involved is strictly professional?

701
01:23:42,059 --> 01:23:44,645
Paul, the motive is money.

702
01:23:44,729 --> 01:23:46,981
The motive is always money.

703
01:23:47,064 --> 01:23:49,817
<i>What about Kenneth?
Can he guarantee delivery?</i>

704
01:23:49,900 --> 01:23:51,986
<i>It's a two-for-one deal.</i>

705
01:23:52,236 --> 01:23:54,488
- You take Jiang out...
- Uh-huh.

706
01:23:54,572 --> 01:23:57,450
Kenneth takes the Kane girl out.

707
01:23:57,533 --> 01:23:59,660
- To close the loop.
- Mmm-hmm.

708
01:23:59,744 --> 01:24:01,620
With no one looking.

709
01:24:01,704 --> 01:24:04,040
Yeah. You're right.

710
01:24:05,249 --> 01:24:06,459
She does sound perfect.

711
01:24:06,542 --> 01:24:08,753
You only have to look at her.

712
01:24:09,211 --> 01:24:10,212
<i>What about the girl?</i>

713
01:24:11,714 --> 01:24:14,008
- What about her?
- Can she handle herself?

714
01:24:15,718 --> 01:24:17,595
I'm sure you'll cope.

715
01:24:22,933 --> 01:24:25,311
I've never done a woman before.

716
01:24:26,395 --> 01:24:29,106
Oh, you shouldn't think of her
as being a woman.

717
01:24:29,190 --> 01:24:31,358
No, that would be a mistake.

718
01:24:32,943 --> 01:24:34,445
<i>What's in this for you?</i>

719
01:24:34,987 --> 01:24:36,697
Besides my money.

720
01:24:38,616 --> 01:24:40,034
A new life.

721
01:24:41,952 --> 01:24:43,496
And a new wife.

722
01:24:45,623 --> 01:24:48,584
That's everything I know.

723
01:24:48,667 --> 01:24:51,295
That's everything I know. That's it.

724
01:24:59,512 --> 01:25:02,848
Mallory!

725
01:25:05,434 --> 01:25:06,936
Mallory!

726
01:26:16,172 --> 01:26:17,214
Dianna.

727
01:26:38,110 --> 01:26:39,403
Dianna.

728
01:27:00,382 --> 01:27:01,508
Shit.
