1
00:01:14,770 --> 00:01:17,740
Orbulus! look, it's Unicron!

2
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:46,870
The ships!  Get to the ships!
It's our only chance!

3
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:07,420
Kranix!

4
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:04,350
There is an evil new force in the universe

5
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:07,950
A monster planet that devours everything in its path...

6
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,800
and it's heading for the smal planet Cybertron

7
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:14,900
where a unique race of transforming robots continue fighting a civil war...

8
00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:18,900
a war between good and evil that has raged for millions of years.

9
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:22,750
The evil Decepticon Transformers, led by the maniacal Megatron,

10
00:03:22,850 --> 00:03:25,600
have sworn to crush their enemies, the Autobots.

11
00:03:25,650 --> 00:03:29,450
To this end, they have relentlessly rescued them across the galaxy

12
00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:32,850
from planet Cybertron to planet Earth and back again.

13
00:03:32,950 --> 00:03:38,450
But the heroic Autobot Transformers and their courageous leader Optimus Prime

14
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:41,500
are not easily defeated.

15
00:03:57,070 --> 00:04:00,000
It is the year 2005.

16
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:05,440
The treacherous Decepticons have conquered the Autobots' home planet of Cybertron.

17
00:04:11,010 --> 00:04:15,120
But, from secret staging grounds on two of Cybertron's moons...

18
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:19,490
...the valiant Autobots prepare to retake their homeland.

19
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:33,940
Ironhide, report to me at once.

20
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:39,210
Every time I look into a monitor, Prime, my circuits sizzle.

21
00:04:39,210 --> 00:04:43,550
When are we gonna start busting Decepti-chops?

22
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:47,320
I want you to make a special run to Autobot City on Earth.

23
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:48,620
But Prime!

24
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:54,290
Listen, Ironhide. We don't have enough energon cubes to power a full-scale assault.

25
00:04:54,290 --> 00:04:57,060
Ready the shuttle for launch.

26
00:04:57,060 --> 00:05:00,260
Your days are numbered now, Decepti-creeps!

27
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:12,780
Jazz, report security status.
No sign of Decepticons here, Prime.

28
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:14,580
What about Moon Base Two?

29
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:18,950
Jazz to Moon Base Two, Jazz to Moon Base Two...

30
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:22,050
Bumblebee and Spike here.

31
00:05:21,950 --> 00:05:26,460
We're about to send up a shuttle. Any Decepticon chinanagins in your area?

32
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:27,960
All clear, Jazz.

33
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:31,430
Hey, Ironhide, tell my son Daniel, I miss him.

34
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:37,670
And tell him not to worry. I'll be coming home as soon as we kick Megatron's tail across the galaxy.

35
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:39,400
Will do, Spike.

36
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:43,270
Cliffjumper, commence countdown.

37
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:49,380
5...4...3...2...1...Blast off!

38
00:05:55,750 --> 00:06:01,290
Now, all we need is a little energon, and a lot of luck.

39
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,770
Laserbeak returns, Megatron.

40
00:06:12,770 --> 00:06:18,910
Welcome, Laserbeak. Unlike some of my other warriors, you never fail me.

41
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:23,250
Soundwave, play back Laserbeak's findings.

42
00:06:23,450 --> 00:06:26,750
As you command Megatron.

43
00:06:30,150 --> 00:06:33,320
<i>I want you to make a special run to Autobot City on Earth.</i>

44
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:34,720
<i>But Prime!</i>

45
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:40,760
<i>Listen, Ironhide. We don't have enough energon cubes to power a full-scale assault.</i>

46
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:43,030
<i>Ready the shuttle for launch.</i>

47
00:06:43,030 --> 00:06:47,640
<i>Now all we need is a little energon, and a lot of luck.</i>

48
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:51,670
More than you imagine, Optimus Prime.

49
00:07:06,190 --> 00:07:07,520
Megatron!

50
00:07:08,390 --> 00:07:12,030
Decepticons!
Die, Autobots!

51
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,670
This was almost too easy, Starscream.

52
00:07:52,670 --> 00:08:01,000
Much easier, almighty Megatron, than attacking the real threat, the Autobots' moon base.

53
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:06,420
You're an idiot, Starscream.  When we slip by their early warning systems

54
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:13,000
in their own shuttle and destroy Autobot City, the Autobots will be vanquished forever.

55
00:08:13,010 --> 00:08:15,250
No!

56
00:08:15,390 --> 00:08:18,500
Such heroic nonsense.

57
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:32,480
Fish are jumping today, huh, Dan-O?

58
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:34,240
I guess so.

59
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,850
Hey, what's the matter?

60
00:08:35,850 --> 00:08:38,620
Uh, I don't know, Hot Rod.

61
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:41,120
Come on, you can tell me.

62
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,990
Guess I just miss my dad.

63
00:08:42,990 --> 00:08:47,660
Don't worry, Spike will be back soon... oh hey! I caught something!

64
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:52,730
Wow! Look at the size of it!

65
00:08:52,730 --> 00:08:55,100
Yep. It's a whopper all right.

66
00:09:01,670 --> 00:09:04,870
Hot Rod, the shuttle's coming. Let's watch it land.

67
00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:07,240
Talk about dull, Daniel.

68
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:12,580
Hurry or we'll miss it!

69
00:09:28,670 --> 00:09:31,730
If you're going to ride, Dan-O, ride in style.

70
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,240
Hey! Let's stop here!

71
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:46,420
Why settle for a peek, Daniel, when you can see everything from Lookout Mountain?

72
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:51,320
A little to the left. A little bit more...

73
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:03,000
Turbo-revvin' young punk! I'll straighten you out yet.

74
00:10:16,410 --> 00:10:19,280
Hot Rod, Look! There's a hole in the shuttle.

75
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:24,120
What?
Decepticons!

76
00:10:29,230 --> 00:10:31,830
What's that darn fool doing?

77
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:38,100
Attack!

78
00:10:55,690 --> 00:10:58,320
Come on down, Auto-brat.

79
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:25,550
Huh. Not bad for an old-timer.

80
00:11:25,550 --> 00:11:30,720
Old-timer? That's something you'll never be if you don't get back to the city.

81
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:35,230
Save it, Kup. Let's burn rubber.

82
00:11:57,210 --> 00:12:01,180
Ultra Magnus, a cursory evaluation of Decepticon capability

83
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:04,020
indicates a distinct tactical deficiency.

84
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:07,760
In other words, Perceptor... We're outnumbered!

85
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:16,070
Springer, you and Arcee transform Autobot City.

86
00:12:16,070 --> 00:12:19,900
Perceptor, tell Blaster to radio Prime for reinforcements.

87
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:22,910
What about me? Hm huh hm huh hm huh? I can help, I want to help. What about me?

88
00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:25,180
Blurr, you can help me alert the others.

89
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:28,780
Absolutely positively definitely. Nobody can get a job done faster than I can. Nobody, nobody, nobody!

90
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:31,250
Come on, Arcee, Let's go!

91
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:34,550
But Hot Rod and Kup are still outside the city.

92
00:12:36,690 --> 00:12:40,490
We can't wait.
They'll have to take care of themselves. Come on!

93
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:06,450
Pathetic fools!
There's no escape.

94
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:46,520
Breach their defenses!

95
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:55,530
Delicious... eh, Shrapnel?

96
00:13:55,530 --> 00:14:00,400
Uh, a little heavy on the electrons, electrons.

97
00:14:05,210 --> 00:14:07,540
The Insecticons are in our way.

98
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:10,250
Wrong. They're our way in. Yah!

99
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:29,170
Look out, shout.

100
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:35,740
Hey Perceptor, what's shaking, other than this fortress?

101
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:41,280
Blaster, Ultra Magnus sends orders to contact Optimus Prime on Moon Base One.

102
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:44,480
All right! Cover your receptors, Perceptor.

103
00:14:50,450 --> 00:14:55,530
Optimus Prime, do you read me? The Decepticons are blitzing Autobot City.

104
00:14:55,530 --> 00:14:59,930
We're really taking a pounding.  Don't know how much longer we can hold out.

105
00:14:59,930 --> 00:15:02,900
Soundwave, jam that transmission.

106
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:09,210
Rumble, Frenzy, Ravage, Ratbat... eject. Operation 

107
00:15:13,710 --> 00:15:20,120
Optimus Prime, do you read me? The Decepticons are blitzing Autobot City. We're really taking a...

108
00:15:22,390 --> 00:15:26,660
First we crack the shell, then we crack the nuts inside.

109
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:42,170
Run, Blaster. Save yourself!
No way. Two can play.

110
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:43,500
Sick'em.

111
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:59,260
Do you think you got through to Prime?

112
00:15:59,260 --> 00:16:04,660
Let's hope so. Cause if I didn't we're all going to look like burnt-out toaster ovens.

113
00:16:07,330 --> 00:16:10,000
We've got Decepticons in the gates, Decepticons in the air, Decepticons inside the walls... Decepticons, Decepticons, Decepticons!

114
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,670
If we pick them off the wall and they show up in the air. If we shoot them out of the air

115
00:16:12,670 --> 00:16:15,510
and they show up in the gates over there, and that leaves us nowhere, that's where!

116
00:16:29,390 --> 00:16:37,250
Come on, Arcee. We've got to get this launcher into place. Megatron's making his big push, and we got to push back.

117
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:45,250
Keep at it Springer my boy. Help's at hand.
Together now.

118
00:16:52,580 --> 00:16:55,980
I was afraid you'd be trapped outside the city.

119
00:16:55,980 --> 00:17:02,550
Hey, I wasn't worried for a microsecond..
Then you probably didn't understand the situation.

120
00:17:05,890 --> 00:17:07,420
That did it.

121
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:15,730
Constructicons, merge for the kill.

122
00:17:15,730 --> 00:17:17,970
Kup, Hot Rod, look!

123
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:22,310
Devastator.

124
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:28,510
Prepare for extermination.

125
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:40,490
I've got better things to do tonight than die.

126
00:18:18,190 --> 00:18:22,030
Their defenses are broken. Let the slaughter begin!

127
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:34,510
Dinobots, destroy Devastator.
Me Grimlock love challenge.

128
00:19:08,510 --> 00:19:13,620
Megatron must be stopped, no matter the cost.

129
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:03,100
Prime.

130
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:07,000
One shall stand; one shall fall.

131
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,410
Why throw away your life so recklessly?

132
00:20:10,410 --> 00:20:13,880
That's a question you should ask yourself, Megatron.

133
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:18,210
No! I'll crush you with my bare hands!

134
00:20:21,050 --> 00:20:25,820
I've got to help Prime.
Stay away, lad. That's Prime's fight.

135
00:21:04,130 --> 00:21:07,400
I'll rip out your optics!

136
00:21:15,510 --> 00:21:18,610
Finish him off, Prime. Do it now.

137
00:21:28,990 --> 00:21:34,160
No more, Optimus Prime! Grant me mercy, I beg of you!

138
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:42,230
You who are without mercy, now plead for it? I thought you were made of sterner stuff.

139
00:21:42,230 --> 00:21:46,170
No you don't, Megatron!
Out of the way, Hot Rod!

140
00:21:50,910 --> 00:21:53,680
Fall. Fall!!!

141
00:22:03,890 --> 00:22:09,930
Ah, I would have waited an eternity for this. It's over, Prime.

142
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:15,770
Never!

143
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:30,250
Optimus, forgive me.

144
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:44,290
How do you feel, "mighty" Megatron?
Astrotrain, transform and get us out of here.

145
00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:50,470
Uh, don't leave me, Soundwave.
As you command, Megatron.

146
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:13,320
The Decepticons are retreating.
Prime did it. He turned the tide.

147
00:23:20,430 --> 00:23:23,470
Astrotrain, take off!

148
00:23:50,660 --> 00:23:54,460
I fear the wounds are fatal.

149
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:03,710
Prime, you can't die!

150
00:24:04,810 --> 00:24:14,180
Do not grieve.
Soon I shall be one with the Matrix.

151
00:24:14,180 --> 00:24:17,420
Prime.

152
00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:30,700
Ultra Magnus, it is to you, old friend, I shall pass the Matrix of Leadership, as it was passed to me.

153
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:37,070
But, Prime, I'm... I'm just a soldier. I'm not worthy.

154
00:24:37,070 --> 00:24:46,550
Nor was I... but one day an Autobot will rise from our ranks

155
00:24:46,550 --> 00:24:54,990
and use the power of the Matrix to light our darkest hour.

156
00:25:08,370 --> 00:25:14,340
Until the day... till all are one...

157
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:42,300
Jettison some weight or I'll never make it to Cybertron.

158
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:49,810
Fellow Decepticons, Astrotrain has requested that we lighten our burden.

159
00:26:49,810 --> 00:26:54,240
In that case I say it is survival of the fittest.

160
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:56,450
Do I hear a second on that?

161
00:26:58,580 --> 00:27:02,690
...and against?
The ayes have it.

162
00:27:05,990 --> 00:27:08,660
Get... Make room for others...

163
00:27:14,130 --> 00:27:18,030
Brothers, don't!

164
00:27:18,030 --> 00:27:24,540
Oh, how it pains me to do this!
Wait... I still function.
Wanna bet?

165
00:27:24,540 --> 00:27:26,780
Starscream!!!!

166
00:27:29,780 --> 00:27:40,720
As Megatron has, how shall we say, departed, I nominate myself as the new leader.

167
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:47,060
Wait. The Constructicons form Devastator, the most powerful robot. We should rule.

168
00:27:47,060 --> 00:27:51,100
Soundwave Superior. Constructicons inferior.

169
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:57,370
Who are you calling inferior?
No one would follow an uncharismatic bore like you!

170
00:27:57,370 --> 00:28:00,640
Hey! Nobody calls Soundwave "unchrasimatic".

171
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:03,050
Yeah! Let's kick tailgate!

172
00:28:03,050 --> 00:28:06,180
Constructicons, unite!

173
00:28:07,380 --> 00:28:09,090
No way!

174
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:44,620
Welcome, Megatron.

175
00:28:56,130 --> 00:28:58,840
Who... Who said that?

176
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:03,840
I am Unicron.

177
00:29:06,610 --> 00:29:09,610
Show yourself.

178
00:29:09,610 --> 00:29:16,920
I have summoned you here for a purpose.
Nobody summons Megatron.

179
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:24,230
Then it pleases me to be the first.
State your business.

180
00:29:24,230 --> 00:29:33,640
This is my command. You are to destroy the Autobot Matrix of Leadership.

181
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:38,780
It is the one thing, the only thing, that can stand in my way.

182
00:29:38,780 --> 00:29:45,680
You have nothing to fear.  I have already crushed Optimus Prime with my bare hands.

183
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:47,820
You exaggerate.

184
00:29:47,820 --> 00:29:52,790
The point is he's dead, and the Matrix died with him.

185
00:29:52,790 --> 00:30:02,930
No. The point is you are a fool! The Matrix has been passed to their new leader, Ultra Magnus.

186
00:30:02,930 --> 00:30:07,870
Destroy it for me.
Why should I? What's in it for me?

187
00:30:07,870 --> 00:30:16,050
Your bargaining posture is highly dubious. But, very well, I will provide you with a new body

188
00:30:16,050 --> 00:30:18,110
and new troops to command.

189
00:30:18,110 --> 00:30:23,990
And?
And nothing! You belong to me now.

190
00:30:23,990 --> 00:30:27,390
I belong to nobody!

191
00:30:27,390 --> 00:30:35,060
Perhaps I misjudged you.
Proceed on your way to oblivion.

192
00:30:35,060 --> 00:30:43,970
NO! No! No!
I accept your terms! I accept!

193
00:30:46,980 --> 00:30:49,310
Excellent.

194
00:31:07,860 --> 00:31:11,100
Behold, Galvatron!

195
00:31:12,140 --> 00:31:15,000
And these shall be your minions.

196
00:31:17,870 --> 00:31:25,250
Scourge, the tracker, and his huntsmen, the sweeps.

197
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:34,560
Cyclonus, the warrior, and his armada commander.

198
00:31:35,390 --> 00:31:38,190
And this shall be your ship.

199
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:47,170
Now Go!
Destroy the Autobot Matrix.

200
00:31:47,170 --> 00:31:54,440
I will rip open Ultra Magnus, and every other Autobot, until the Matrix has been destroyed.

201
00:31:58,350 --> 00:32:00,280
To Cybertron!

202
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:14,500
Destroy the Matrix.

203
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:29,710
Get on with the ceremony.

204
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:45,330
My fellow Decepticons, as your new leader, I...

205
00:32:49,630 --> 00:32:53,100
Who disrupts my coronation?

206
00:32:53,940 --> 00:33:01,110
Coronation, Starscream? This is bad comedy.
Megatron, is that you?

207
00:33:01,110 --> 00:33:02,850
Here's a hint!

208
00:33:27,890 --> 00:33:32,260
Will anyone else attempt to fill his shoes?

209
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:37,500
What'd he say his name was?
Galvatron!

210
00:33:37,550 --> 00:33:41,050
Long live Galvatron!
Galvatron!

211
00:33:52,180 --> 00:33:54,250
Where'd that come from?

212
00:33:56,550 --> 00:34:00,090
Who cares?
I'm more worried about where it's going?

213
00:34:04,490 --> 00:34:08,700
Talk to me, Earth. We've got a situation out here.

214
00:34:13,830 --> 00:34:17,270
Roger me! Wilco me! anything! Hello, hello, Earth.

215
00:34:18,010 --> 00:34:20,070
I'm picking up a faint signal.

216
00:34:21,010 --> 00:34:26,750
This is Jazz. A gi-normous, weird-looking planet just showed up in the suburbs of Cybertron.

217
00:34:26,750 --> 00:34:31,820
And it's attacking Moon Base One.
Jazz! Cliffjumper!

218
00:34:41,130 --> 00:34:43,960
Got to blast free, if we can.

219
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:47,470
Ignition and...
Hit it!

220
00:34:51,940 --> 00:34:54,840
Jazz! We're not getting away!

221
00:34:59,010 --> 00:35:02,380
This is Spike and Bumblebee, up here on Moon Base Two.

222
00:35:02,380 --> 00:35:07,420
This thing, this monster planet, just ripped the first moon to shreds.

223
00:35:07,420 --> 00:35:11,020
...and it's heading this way.
We'll try and slow it down.

224
00:35:11,020 --> 00:35:15,100
But you better get here fast, because we're not going to...

225
00:35:15,100 --> 00:35:16,800
Dad!

226
00:35:17,530 --> 00:35:22,870
Bumblebee, activate the explosives.
If this doesn't stop him, nothing will.

227
00:35:22,870 --> 00:35:26,340
The explosives are activated. Let's get out of here.

228
00:35:31,910 --> 00:35:34,780
Hurry! It's going to blow!

229
00:35:54,940 --> 00:35:58,140
All right! Hooray! We did it! We done it! Way to go!

230
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:04,340
Look!
It isn't even dented! What are we going to do now?

231
00:36:07,780 --> 00:36:11,320
We're being sucked into it!

232
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:17,590
How dare, Unicron! Cybertron and all it's moons belong to me!

233
00:36:24,130 --> 00:36:27,900
But remember, we belong to him.

234
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:30,770
I belong to nobody.

235
00:36:36,780 --> 00:36:40,080
I will obey, Unicron.

236
00:36:44,490 --> 00:36:46,750
Decepticons, to Earth.

237
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:54,630
Autobots, prepare to board the shuttles This new menace is more dangerous

238
00:36:54,630 --> 00:37:00,600
than all the Decepticons put together.
Somehow we must destroy it before it devours Cybertron.

239
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:06,310
But what about my dad? He... he's on the moon between that monster planet and Cybertron.

240
00:37:06,310 --> 00:37:09,940
Daniel, we'll do everything we can for Spike.

241
00:37:09,940 --> 00:37:15,120
And what are we going to do when we get there? That thing crunches moons, it'll make short work of us.

242
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:18,620
Maybe the matrix can stop it.
You're right; it can!

243
00:37:18,620 --> 00:37:22,120
What do you know about it, lad?
I've just got this feeling.

244
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:23,960
Look!

245
00:37:27,630 --> 00:37:29,400
To the shuttles!

246
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:36,600
I, Galvatron, will crush you, just as Megatron crushed Prime.

247
00:37:37,300 --> 00:37:41,310
And you'll die trying, just like Megatron.

248
00:37:41,310 --> 00:37:43,880
Autobot scrap!

249
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:46,210
Do you want me to gun Ultra Magnus?

250
00:37:46,210 --> 00:37:50,950
There are plenty of Autobots for you. Ultra Magnus is mine!

251
00:37:55,390 --> 00:37:59,760
Stay close to me, Daniel..
And you better stay close to me.

252
00:38:03,430 --> 00:38:06,370
No, you better stay close to me.

253
00:38:06,370 --> 00:38:09,600
Nice Dino, good Dino, sweet Dino, wouldn't you step in the nice spaceship for Blurr? Pretty please? Pretty pretty pretty please?

254
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:13,370
Pretty pretty pretty please? Nice Dino, good Dino, with a cherry and sugar and whipped cream on top? Nice Dino, good Dino, sweet Dino?

255
00:38:13,370 --> 00:38:19,250
Me Grimlock not "nice dino".
Me bash brains!

256
00:38:34,860 --> 00:38:37,400
Blurr, get the Dinobots in the shuttle.

257
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:39,930
I'm trying to get them in the shuttle, Ultra Magnus, cause I know we can't launch the shuttle until we get them in the shuttle,

258
00:38:39,930 --> 00:38:43,140
but I can't seem to get them in the shuttle, because they're impossible, impossible, impossible!

259
00:38:43,140 --> 00:38:48,010
Okay, forget it. Kup, Hot Rod, you get the Dinobots aboard and get us out of here!

260
00:38:58,420 --> 00:39:00,850
Come on, you big bozo, get in the shuttle.

261
00:39:07,530 --> 00:39:11,470
This reminds me of the battle on Alpha 9. The Petro-rabbits were...

262
00:39:11,470 --> 00:39:18,040
Grimlock, get your noodle out of my face!
Me Grimlock love Kup's war stories.

263
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:23,540
You're living one now. Engage the boosters, for Cybertron's sake!

264
00:39:23,540 --> 00:39:30,680
Tell Grimlock about Petro-rabbits again.
I'll give you petro-rabbits. Contact.

265
00:39:42,030 --> 00:39:46,100
Looks like we're shipmates, squirt.
All right!

266
00:39:46,100 --> 00:39:49,070
But if you get spacesick, you're going to walk home.

267
00:39:55,340 --> 00:39:56,740
Hurry.

268
00:39:59,380 --> 00:40:02,350
Wait, Ultra Magnus! Arcee's still out there!

269
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:08,060
Jump!

270
00:40:20,930 --> 00:40:25,010
Thanks.
Whew. That was close.

271
00:40:25,010 --> 00:40:27,570
Believe it or not, this is the fun part.

272
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:46,790
Congratulations, Autobots, we've lost them.
So rest while you can.

273
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:54,970
I remember the dust was so thick off Beta 4, you had to use windshield wipers on your optic sensors.

274
00:40:54,970 --> 00:41:00,870
Me Grimlock know all about wipers, want to hear good part of story.

275
00:41:00,870 --> 00:41:04,040
Good part, Kup. Tell Swoop good part.

276
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:14,660
Okay, okay. Well, the dust was really thick. And then this gigantic Ichyac came tromping and stomping down the mountain,

277
00:41:14,660 --> 00:41:19,430
flames spewing out of its nostrils. And I thought for sure...

278
00:41:19,430 --> 00:41:23,200
Hey, Kup, don't you think we have better things to do now than tell old stories?

279
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:24,630
Like what?

280
00:41:24,630 --> 00:41:29,400
Like try to figure out how we're going to rescue our friends, and then save Cybertron.

281
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:32,140
No. Tell story.

282
00:41:32,140 --> 00:41:36,310
Quiet. We want to hear story. Tell story, tell story.

283
00:41:38,450 --> 00:41:40,250
Time out, time out, time out!

284
00:41:51,630 --> 00:41:55,600
They're closing on us.
Yep, like the shrikebats of Dromedon.

285
00:41:55,600 --> 00:42:00,700
How'd you beat them? I'm trying to remember. There were an awful lot of casualties that day.

286
00:42:00,700 --> 00:42:04,200
Oh, yeah! We inverted polarities.

287
00:42:05,140 --> 00:42:06,670
They're coming back!

288
00:42:13,860 --> 00:42:18,040
All right! We survived that.
But will we survive this?

289
00:42:22,210 --> 00:42:25,480
Cyclonus, transform and attack.

290
00:42:44,900 --> 00:42:46,530
I can't control it!

291
00:42:50,530 --> 00:42:51,900
We're going to crash!

292
00:42:57,270 --> 00:43:01,650
Kup and Hot Rod just bought it.
I can't deal with that now.

293
00:43:05,350 --> 00:43:10,150
Face it, Magnus. The Decepticons are going to dog us until they see us dead.

294
00:43:10,150 --> 00:43:14,730
Then that's exactly what they're going to see.
Prepare for emergency separation.

295
00:43:14,730 --> 00:43:17,860
That's too dangerous!.
What choice do we have?

296
00:43:47,530 --> 00:43:54,830
The Autobots have been terminated.
Excellent. And the Matrix with them.

297
00:43:56,800 --> 00:44:00,340
No! Unicron! Why?
Take me to Unicron! Take me now!

298
00:44:18,090 --> 00:44:21,260
Did you have to let them detonate three-quarters of the ship?

299
00:44:21,260 --> 00:44:25,800
Seeing as how they would have detonated four quarters, I think it was a good choice.

300
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:28,330
But now how are we going to get there in this wreck?

301
00:44:28,330 --> 00:44:31,940
Perceptor, can you locate a place to set down for repairs?

302
00:44:31,940 --> 00:44:37,310
Gamma rays in this sector of space create marginal navigation probabilities. However...

303
00:44:37,310 --> 00:44:42,280
ahem, yes. I believe I can. he planet of junk is in this vicinity.

304
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:44,010
Then let's go for it.

305
00:44:57,500 --> 00:45:04,000
Kup! Grimlock! Slag! Anybody!

306
00:45:22,700 --> 00:45:25,570
Hot Rod, help me!

307
00:45:25,570 --> 00:45:29,410
Kup... Kup!

308
00:45:38,550 --> 00:45:40,050
Help...

309
00:46:24,250 --> 00:46:27,720
Kup, talk to me.

310
00:46:31,050 --> 00:46:35,130
Fix me.
Sure, Kup. Right away.

311
00:47:00,580 --> 00:47:02,190
Brace for impact.

312
00:47:24,780 --> 00:47:29,280
Say something. Anybody.

313
00:47:30,710 --> 00:47:33,950
Remind me to give the auto-pilot a raise.

314
00:47:34,450 --> 00:47:39,020
Daniel?
I, I'm okay.

315
00:47:41,490 --> 00:47:45,330
Let's try to salvage this thing.
Can I help too?

316
00:47:45,330 --> 00:47:47,430
It's rough out there, kid.

317
00:47:48,030 --> 00:47:52,700
I think Daniel can make himself useful with this. It was Spike's Exo-Suit.

318
00:47:52,700 --> 00:47:56,570
Dad's Exo-Suit! He told me all about it.

319
00:47:56,600 --> 00:47:58,000
Here, try it on.

320
00:48:02,710 --> 00:48:05,380
Now try to walk. Come on, you can do it.

321
00:48:14,660 --> 00:48:20,530
Just think about what you want to do before you do it.
It's kind of tricky.

322
00:48:24,300 --> 00:48:26,640
Keep on practicing. You'll get the hang of it.

323
00:48:26,640 --> 00:48:29,570
Come on, showtime's over. We've got work to do.

324
00:48:41,020 --> 00:48:44,590
This must be the junk capitol of the universe.

325
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:56,200
Stop, thief! No welcome-wagon hello stranger with that good coffee flavor for you.

326
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:58,600
Yeah, yeah.
Or your money back.

327
00:48:58,740 --> 00:49:02,770
Offer expires while you wait. Operators are standing by.

328
00:49:10,810 --> 00:49:14,120
That does it. So, what do you think?

329
00:49:22,560 --> 00:49:28,000
Of all the circuit-glitched diode-blowin' dimwittery. You left a piece out!

330
00:49:28,200 --> 00:49:35,000
No way; you're just a little stiff.
Anyway, all things considered, you've done an amazing job, lad. Amazing.

331
00:49:35,070 --> 00:49:40,040
Really?
Yeah. You even got rid of a nasty burr in my rotator.

332
00:49:40,040 --> 00:49:43,810
Now let's find the Dinobots and get off this twisted planet.

333
00:50:01,870 --> 00:50:07,400
Don't act hostile; I'll use the universal greeting.
Universal greeting?

334
00:50:07,400 --> 00:50:10,870
I'll have them eating out of my hand:

335
00:50:10,900 --> 00:50:14,500
Bah weep granah weep nini bong!

336
00:50:14,550 --> 00:50:17,100
Bah weep granah weep nini bong?

337
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:21,250
Bah weep granah weep nini bong!

338
00:50:21,620 --> 00:50:27,420
See? The universal greeting works every time. Now, without making any sudden moves,

339
00:50:27,420 --> 00:50:29,730
offer them an energon goodie.

340
00:50:32,600 --> 00:50:34,630
This is getting expensive.

341
00:50:34,630 --> 00:50:37,000
Don't worry. They'll reciprocate.

342
00:50:40,070 --> 00:50:48,310
I thought they were supposed to reciprocate.
No more. Empty.

343
00:51:06,830 --> 00:51:10,730
Reminds me of the Nitith Slave Mines on Galganas 7.

344
00:51:10,730 --> 00:51:16,040
Every place reminds you of someplace else.
Experience, lad. You should learn to appreciate it.

345
00:51:16,040 --> 00:51:17,940
A lot of good it's done us so far.

346
00:51:17,940 --> 00:51:20,710
Hey, what's going on over there?

347
00:51:20,710 --> 00:51:25,780
Has the Imperial Majester delivered a verdict?

348
00:51:25,780 --> 00:51:30,550
I have.
Guilty or innocent?

349
00:51:30,550 --> 00:51:34,860
Innocent.
Feed him to the Sharkticons.

350
00:51:45,030 --> 00:51:47,770
We've got to get a new travel agent.

351
00:51:48,770 --> 00:51:52,250
<i>Bah weep granah weep nini bong.</i>

352
00:51:55,910 --> 00:51:58,780
What is this place?

353
00:51:59,480 --> 00:52:05,090
The world of the savage Sharkticons, and their cruel masters, the Quintessons.

354
00:52:05,090 --> 00:52:10,090
I am Kranix. My planet was destroyed by Unicron.

355
00:52:10,090 --> 00:52:17,500
Unicron. Who's Unicron?
A planet that devours everything in its path.

356
00:52:17,500 --> 00:52:20,170
So that's the monster's name.

357
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:29,250
No, please! I'm the last survivor of lithone! No, no!

358
00:52:31,350 --> 00:52:32,750
Let him go.

359
00:52:35,520 --> 00:52:44,260
Soon you too shall receive your sentence.
Has the Imperial Majester reached a verdict?

360
00:52:44,260 --> 00:52:49,700
I have.
Guilty or innocent?

361
00:52:49,700 --> 00:52:58,980
Spare me this mockery of justice!
I repeat, guilty or innocent?

362
00:52:58,980 --> 00:53:01,480
Innocent.

363
00:53:13,590 --> 00:53:16,030
Not the end I'd wish for, lad.

364
00:53:27,040 --> 00:53:29,040
Me Swoop no see nothing.

365
00:53:29,040 --> 00:53:33,810
Me Grimlock positive Hot Rod and Kup close.

366
00:53:33,810 --> 00:53:38,250
Me Slag say you full of beryllium bologna.

367
00:53:40,680 --> 00:53:44,650
Me Grimlock say you full of cesium salami.

368
00:53:44,650 --> 00:53:47,160
Beryllium bologna!

369
00:53:48,060 --> 00:53:52,600
Friend find, look behind.
Who say that?

370
00:53:59,170 --> 00:54:04,010
Friend find, look behind. You go wrong way. You fool I say.

371
00:54:04,010 --> 00:54:10,510
Me Grimlock fool?
Picture you got. No fool you not.

372
00:54:10,600 --> 00:54:14,700
Me Grimlock no like you.

373
00:54:22,590 --> 00:54:25,960
Why boy hit my nose?

374
00:54:25,960 --> 00:54:29,230
Wheelie say find friends today.

375
00:54:29,230 --> 00:54:32,400
Me Grimlock say we on our way.

376
00:54:47,420 --> 00:54:53,220
Unicron, why did you torture me?
You have failed.

377
00:54:53,220 --> 00:55:00,260
No, Unicron. Ultra Magnus is dead, and the Matrix destroyed.

378
00:55:00,260 --> 00:55:11,070
The Matrix has not been destroyed, and Ultra Magnus lives on the planet of junk.

379
00:55:11,610 --> 00:55:19,250
Stalk him. Tear him apart, and destroy the Matrix.

380
00:55:23,650 --> 00:55:27,020
Be sure the fittings are securely welded.

381
00:55:27,020 --> 00:55:29,790
Absolutely, positively, definitely. I wouldn't do it any other way, any other way at all.

382
00:55:29,790 --> 00:55:34,400
This Exo-Suit's fantastic. I think I'm starting to get the hang of it.

383
00:55:38,200 --> 00:55:41,500
Forward, avanti, and like, go for the gusto.

384
00:55:42,750 --> 00:55:44,000
Hold on.

385
00:55:46,580 --> 00:55:50,080
Decepticons! We've got to draw them off and double back to the shuttle.

386
00:56:03,960 --> 00:56:05,630
There goes the shuttle.

387
00:56:12,470 --> 00:56:14,400
What do I do?

388
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:17,440
Transform, transform. You can do it, I know you can do it, you can do it.

389
00:56:19,040 --> 00:56:21,510
Transform.

390
00:56:26,450 --> 00:56:30,320
Human germ.
Transform.

391
00:56:38,360 --> 00:56:41,300
There they are.
Attack!

392
00:56:49,110 --> 00:56:52,410
Make a break for cover. I'll try and unleash the power of the Matrix.

393
00:56:54,310 --> 00:56:56,210
Till all are one!

394
00:56:58,950 --> 00:57:01,380
Till all are one.

395
00:57:11,090 --> 00:57:12,760
Open, damn it, open.

396
00:57:15,830 --> 00:57:20,170
Prime, you said the matrix will light our darkest hour.

397
00:57:20,170 --> 00:57:25,540
Magnus, I want the Matrix.
Never!

398
00:57:25,540 --> 00:57:27,980
Sweeps, terminate him.

399
00:57:34,320 --> 00:57:37,050
Die. Die!

400
00:57:41,160 --> 00:57:49,250
Unicron, my master, with this I shall make you my slave.

401
00:57:49,750 --> 00:57:52,000
Nooo!

402
00:57:52,640 --> 00:57:58,740
Before his Imperial Majester delivers a verdict, would you like to beg for your lives?

403
00:57:58,740 --> 00:58:03,350
It sometimes helps, but not often.

404
00:58:03,350 --> 00:58:07,620
I can't transform.
Keep trying.

405
00:58:07,620 --> 00:58:10,720
Silence, or you will be held in contempt of this court.

406
00:58:10,720 --> 00:58:17,060
I have nothing but contempt of this court.
Guilty or innocent?

407
00:58:17,060 --> 00:58:18,960
Innocent.

408
00:58:24,500 --> 00:58:28,000
They've got more Sharkticons than we've got photon charges.

409
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:31,170
Then let's hold a demolition derby.

410
00:59:22,260 --> 00:59:25,230
Didn't even bend a fender.

411
00:59:25,230 --> 00:59:30,370
Yeah, but look. There's a lot more of those can-diggin' grill-crackin' things.

412
00:59:34,870 --> 00:59:40,110
We can't hold out forever, Kup, but we can give them one humongous repair bill!

413
00:59:59,030 --> 01:00:01,400
Execute them...

414
01:00:07,370 --> 01:00:09,210
Excuse me.

415
01:00:12,840 --> 01:00:16,210
Me Grimlock want to munch metal.

416
01:00:40,470 --> 01:00:44,170
I never thought I'd be glad to see those big bozos.

417
01:00:44,170 --> 01:00:48,080
Me Grimlock no bozo, me king.

418
01:00:48,080 --> 01:00:50,950
Sharkticons, execute them.

419
01:00:57,290 --> 01:01:01,260
Me Grimlock say execute them.

420
01:01:05,630 --> 01:01:09,900
I think the problems on this planet will be solved very shortly.

421
01:01:09,900 --> 01:01:13,170
Yeah, but what about our problems? We need a ship.

422
01:01:13,170 --> 01:01:16,670
You get ship if I get trip.
Who are you?

423
01:01:16,670 --> 01:01:22,410
Him Wheelie. Him friend.
He'll be mine too if he can find a ship.

424
01:01:22,410 --> 01:01:27,750
Ship: Stare over there.
That's a ship?

425
01:01:27,750 --> 01:01:30,250
Who cares, as long as it flies.

426
01:01:40,960 --> 01:01:42,730
Ultra Magnus...

427
01:01:42,730 --> 01:01:45,670
Without the Matrix there is no hope, no hope, no hope, no hope at all.

428
01:01:46,100 --> 01:01:49,040
First Prime, now Ultra Magnus. What do you do?

429
01:01:51,540 --> 01:01:52,980
Look!

430
01:01:52,980 --> 01:02:03,720
Don't look behind door number two, Monty. It's time to play End of the Line, My Valentine. Geroni-geron-ron-ronimo!

431
01:02:36,690 --> 01:02:41,120
It's not hard to knock 'em down, it's getting them to stay down that's the trick.

432
01:02:41,720 --> 01:02:46,230
They're indestructible, and they're everywhere!

433
01:02:49,300 --> 01:02:51,600
You check in, but you don;t check out.

434
01:03:50,730 --> 01:03:55,930
Steady as she goes, Bob. Snoopy visitors get mud in the eye, by and by. Film at eleven.

435
01:04:02,710 --> 01:04:04,750
It's Hot Rod.

436
01:04:04,800 --> 01:04:08,000
And Kup and the Dinobots.

437
01:04:09,510 --> 01:04:11,880
Guns aren't exactly friendly.

438
01:04:11,880 --> 01:04:14,120
Neither are they, in case you haven't noticed.

439
01:04:14,120 --> 01:04:17,700
What was that universal greeting again? Never mind; I remember.

440
01:04:17,750 --> 01:04:21,500
Bah weep granah weep nini bong.

441
01:04:21,750 --> 01:04:24,750
Bah weep granah weep nini bong.

442
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:27,500
Bah weep granah weep nini bong.

443
01:04:27,850 --> 01:04:31,500
Bah weep granah weep nini bong.

444
01:04:56,990 --> 01:05:01,930
Me Grimlock not kisser. Me Grimlock king.

445
01:05:03,430 --> 01:05:11,340
Have a nice day and... ??? ... so say the Junkions.

446
01:05:11,340 --> 01:05:18,110
Where'd you learn to talk like that?
TV. We talk TV. You talk some TV?

447
01:05:18,110 --> 01:05:24,320
I talk some TV and now the news, don't touch that dial.

448
01:05:24,320 --> 01:05:29,360
By George, Kimosaves, your smashed-up friend soon like brand new with 90-day warranty.

449
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:42,750
Happy motoring. Cock-a-doodle-doo!

450
01:05:46,940 --> 01:05:53,320
Look, he's alive. I don't believe it.
You're all alive?

451
01:05:53,320 --> 01:05:58,960
The Matrix...
It's gone.

452
01:05:58,960 --> 01:06:02,060
And with it, all hope.
No!

453
01:06:02,060 --> 01:06:05,430
Galvatron has it.
Where's Galvatron? Where is he?

454
01:06:05,430 --> 01:06:11,940
And the answer is: Unicron.
Then we've got to destroy Unicron.

455
01:06:11,940 --> 01:06:17,370
Yes, friends, act now; destroy Unicron. Kill the Grand Poobah.

456
01:06:17,370 --> 01:06:26,020
Eliminate even the toughest stains. Hurry, hurry, hurry, sale must end. Rush right on down and test-drive latest model with no obligation.

457
01:06:26,020 --> 01:06:33,190
New improved Junkion planet is sleek, sexy import with turbo handling..

458
01:06:42,930 --> 01:06:48,910
Yeah! Destroy Unicron! Kill the Grand Poobah! Eliminate even the toughest stains!

459
01:07:03,820 --> 01:07:15,570
Unicron! Unicron! Answer me! See this: the Matrix. I now possess that which you most fear!

460
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:18,550
NOOO!

461
01:07:18,570 --> 01:07:22,750
You'll do my bidding, or taste my wrath!

462
01:07:28,140 --> 01:07:32,050
You underestimate me, Galvatron.

463
01:08:19,730 --> 01:08:27,540
For a time, I considered sparing your wretched little planet, Cybertron.

464
01:08:27,540 --> 01:08:35,650
But now you shall witness its dismemberment.
No!

465
01:08:43,350 --> 01:08:47,520
Decepticons, we're under attack. Scramble!

466
01:09:28,250 --> 01:09:34,800
I don't believe it. Doesn't this remind you of anything, Kup?
Nope. Never seen anything like it before.

467
01:09:34,840 --> 01:09:42,110
What happened to Moon Base Two? Where's my dad? That's what we're going to find out.

468
01:09:48,650 --> 01:09:55,730
...and enamel. Resists fire, rain and corrosion for up to five years. Satisfaction guaranteed.

469
01:09:55,730 --> 01:09:58,090
Or your money back!

470
01:10:25,120 --> 01:10:30,460
Where's Hot Rod?
I don't know, but I hope they didn't get him.

471
01:10:31,030 --> 01:10:33,360
Quick, this way.

472
01:11:11,200 --> 01:11:16,610
The Matrix!
It will do you no good, Autobot. It can not be opened.

473
01:11:16,610 --> 01:11:19,180
Not by a Decepticon.

474
01:11:19,180 --> 01:11:24,310
Like it or not, we are allies now against a common foe.

475
01:11:25,780 --> 01:11:32,420
Destroy him Galvatron, now, or you yourself shall be obliterated.

476
01:11:32,420 --> 01:11:36,590
Of course, my master.

477
01:11:50,170 --> 01:11:55,010
Puny Autobot. You lack even Prime's courage.

478
01:12:10,390 --> 01:12:13,430
Me Grimlock kick butt.

479
01:12:30,780 --> 01:12:35,190
Me Grimlock need new strategy.

480
01:12:44,530 --> 01:12:49,300
Help! Help!
Daniel!

481
01:13:09,090 --> 01:13:11,150
Arcee! Kup!

482
01:13:47,120 --> 01:13:49,590
Dad!
Daniel!

483
01:13:49,590 --> 01:13:53,160
Dad, what can I do?
Knock down the acid cover.

484
01:13:53,160 --> 01:13:55,770
How?
Blast it, son!

485
01:13:55,770 --> 01:14:03,310
But I don't have a gun.
Use your Exo-Suit. Hurry!

486
01:14:19,490 --> 01:14:23,890
Daniel! You did it!
Yeah. I did it!

487
01:14:26,860 --> 01:14:34,200
Come out, Autobot. We all must die sometime.
Not today, Galvatron.

488
01:15:13,880 --> 01:15:23,020
I will crush you with my bare hands.
Die, Autobot.

489
01:15:38,400 --> 01:15:49,710
First Prime, then Ultra Magnus, and now you. It's a pity you Autobots die so easily,

490
01:15:49,710 --> 01:15:54,420
or I might have a sense of satisfaction. Now...

491
01:16:01,160 --> 01:16:04,890
Arise, Rodimus Prime.

492
01:16:04,890 --> 01:16:06,660
Optimus?

493
01:16:08,130 --> 01:16:09,770
No!

494
01:16:18,210 --> 01:16:22,410
This is the end of the road Galvatron.

495
01:16:42,700 --> 01:16:47,640
Now, light our darkest hour.

01:17:34,920 --> 01:17:38,020
No time to answer that now. Let's get out of here.

01:17:49,130 --> 01:17:52,940
Autobots, transform and roll out.

504
01:18:57,270 --> 01:18:59,870
Till all are one.

505
01:18:59,870 --> 01:19:02,540
Till all are one.

506
01:19:03,740 --> 01:19:05,280
Till all are one.
