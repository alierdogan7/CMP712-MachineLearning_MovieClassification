01:04:22,300 --> 01:04:25,400
There are glasses in the bar.

748
01:04:29,200 --> 01:04:30,700
Hmm.

749
01:04:36,400 --> 01:04:38,600
You know what you're doing?

750
01:04:59,600 --> 01:05:01,900
I like your place, Brenda.

751
01:05:01,900 --> 01:05:06,300
I've been here three months.
Still fixing it up.

752
01:05:10,100 --> 01:05:12,200
Interesting view.

753
01:05:12,300 --> 01:05:14,300
What did you say?

754
01:05:19,400 --> 01:05:22,100
I said, "Interesting view"!

755
01:05:22,100 --> 01:05:23,800
Isn't it great?

756
01:05:29,700 --> 01:05:31,600
You never told me...

757
01:05:31,700 --> 01:05:34,700
what you do
for a living.

758
01:05:34,700 --> 01:05:39,500
I work for
the Metropolitan Museum...

759
01:05:39,500 --> 01:05:42,300
in acquisitions.

760
01:05:42,300 --> 01:05:45,400
Huh. That explains
your interest...

761
01:05:45,500 --> 01:05:47,800
in ancient weapons.

762
01:05:49,900 --> 01:05:51,300
Right.

763
01:05:52,800 --> 01:05:55,800
Especially the samurai.

764
01:05:55,900 --> 01:05:57,400
Very nice.

765
01:05:57,500 --> 01:05:59,900
Shall we have a toast?

766
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:01,500
Yes.

767
01:06:06,500 --> 01:06:08,400
Brandy.

768
01:06:08,500 --> 01:06:11,100
Bottled in 1783.

769
01:06:11,200 --> 01:06:13,400
Wow. That's old.

770
01:06:16,200 --> 01:06:19,600
1783 was a very good year.

771
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:23,400
Mozart wrote
his great mass.

772
01:06:23,500 --> 01:06:26,100
The Montgolfier Brothers went up...

773
01:06:26,200 --> 01:06:29,100
in their first balloon.

774
01:06:31,200 --> 01:06:32,500
Hah.

775
01:06:32,500 --> 01:06:34,400
And England recognized...

776
01:06:34,500 --> 01:06:38,000
the independence
of the United States.

777
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:40,400
Is that right?

778
01:06:40,500 --> 01:06:41,800
Yes.

779
01:06:49,400 --> 01:06:50,900
What's that?

780
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:53,000
It's for you.

781
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:54,600
Can I open it?

782
01:06:54,700 --> 01:06:56,400
If you like.

783
01:07:10,800 --> 01:07:11,700
You bastard.

784
01:07:11,700 --> 01:07:13,700
Where did you find this?

785
01:07:13,700 --> 01:07:15,800
I have an extensive library.

786
01:07:17,400 --> 01:07:18,700
Odd thing.

787
01:07:18,800 --> 01:07:21,200
Your bio doesn't
mention the Met.

788
01:07:21,200 --> 01:07:23,700
It says you work
for the police...

789
01:07:23,700 --> 01:07:25,500
in forensics.

790
01:07:25,600 --> 01:07:27,700
Are you and Moran
setting me up?

791
01:07:27,800 --> 01:07:29,700
I don't work for Moran.

792
01:07:29,800 --> 01:07:32,200
Then why is that bald policeman...

793
01:07:32,300 --> 01:07:34,700
sitting outside
watching your apartment?

794
01:07:36,500 --> 01:07:37,700
You remember him.

795
01:07:37,800 --> 01:07:39,100
Moran's had him tailing me.

796
01:07:39,200 --> 01:07:41,300
What are you going to do?

797
01:07:41,400 --> 01:07:44,100
Question is,
what are you going to do?

798
01:07:44,100 --> 01:07:46,800
Turn off the tape or
shoot me with the .45?

799
01:07:50,400 --> 01:07:52,400
I'm not looking
for a killer.

800
01:07:52,400 --> 01:07:53,900
I'm looking for a sword.

801
01:07:53,900 --> 01:07:55,900
The one used on Fasil.

802
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:58,800
- I only want to see the samurai.
- Why?

803
01:07:58,800 --> 01:08:00,800
Because it's not
supposed to exist.

804
01:08:00,900 --> 01:08:03,000
I dated the blade
at 600 B.C.

805
01:08:03,100 --> 01:08:05,400
The metal had been
folded 200 times.

806
01:08:05,500 --> 01:08:09,000
The Japanese didn't make swords
like that till the Middle Ages.

807
01:08:09,100 --> 01:08:11,300
So where the hell
did it come from?

808
01:08:11,400 --> 01:08:13,300
If I could verify
its existence...

809
01:08:13,400 --> 01:08:15,800
it would be like
discovering a 747...

810
01:08:15,900 --> 01:08:18,900
a thousand years
before the Wright Brothers ever flew.

811
01:08:18,900 --> 01:08:21,400
This is crazy.

812
01:08:21,400 --> 01:08:24,000
Wait a minute, Nash.
I want some answers.

813
01:08:25,900 --> 01:08:27,900
You want?

814
01:08:27,900 --> 01:08:30,300
Don't you ever
think about anything...

815
01:08:30,400 --> 01:08:32,000
except what you want?

816
01:08:41,800 --> 01:08:43,200
[ Sigh ]

817
01:08:46,400 --> 01:08:48,500

You must leave her, brother.

~ When love must die? ~~

838
01:10:54,600 --> 01:10:57,000
My beautiful man.

839
01:10:57,100 --> 01:10:59,000
My husband.

840
01:10:59,100 --> 01:11:02,200
I am that, my love.

841
01:11:06,100 --> 01:11:09,400
I've never really known...

842
01:11:09,500 --> 01:11:11,100
What?

843
01:11:12,800 --> 01:11:15,100
Why you stayed.

844
01:11:16,500 --> 01:11:19,900
Because I love you
as much now...

845
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:23,000
as the first day we met.

846
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:25,600
And I love you.

847
01:11:30,100 --> 01:11:33,000
I don't want to die.

848
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:37,500
I want to stay
with you forever.

849
01:11:37,500 --> 01:11:39,500
I want that too.

850
01:11:39,500 --> 01:11:43,100
Will you do something
for me, Connor?

851
01:11:45,500 --> 01:11:47,000
What, lass?

852
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:51,000
In the years to come,
will you light a candle...

853
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:54,100
and remember me
on my birthday?

854
01:11:54,200 --> 01:11:58,800
Aye, love. I will.

855
01:11:58,900 --> 01:12:02,600
I wanted to have
your children.

856
01:12:02,700 --> 01:12:06,900
They would have been
strong and fine.

857
01:12:11,100 --> 01:12:13,500
Don't see me, Connor.

01:12:13,600 --> 01:12:16,300
Let me die in peace.

We're in the highlands.

I made for you.

Good night,
my bonny Heather.

868
01:13:31,100 --> 01:13:33,600
Hey! Kastagir.

869
01:13:34,600 --> 01:13:38,000
Macleod, it's good
to see you again.

870
01:13:38,100 --> 01:13:41,000
It seems like 100 years.

871
01:13:41,100 --> 01:13:43,700
It's been 100 years.

872
01:13:51,400 --> 01:13:53,300
How have you been?

873
01:13:55,200 --> 01:13:57,600
Hey, this...

874
01:13:57,600 --> 01:14:01,500
puts hairs on your chest.

875
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:05,500
What is it?

876
01:14:05,600 --> 01:14:06,900
Boom-boom.

877
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:08,500
Big strong man like you...

878
01:14:08,600 --> 01:14:11,300
shouldn't be afraid
of a little boom-boom.

879
01:14:11,400 --> 01:14:14,400
Maybe you think
I'm trying to poison you.

880
01:14:14,500 --> 01:14:16,300

881

caught us, friend.

Has it? Do you think
we should go on?

885
01:14:31,200 --> 01:14:33,600
I think we should
have a party.

886
01:14:33,700 --> 01:14:36,900
Oh, no. I remember
our last party.

887
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:38,000
Really?

888
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:39,500
When exactly was that?

889
01:14:39,600 --> 01:14:41,500
It was 1783.

890
01:14:41,600 --> 01:14:44,200
1783.

891
01:14:44,300 --> 01:14:45,700
Oh, yes.

892
01:14:45,700 --> 01:14:48,200
Your famous duel
on Boston Common.

893
01:14:48,200 --> 01:14:49,700
Ha ha ha!
You were drunk.

894
01:14:49,700 --> 01:14:52,200
What was that guy's name again?

895
01:14:52,200 --> 01:14:53,700
His name was Bassett.

896
01:14:53,800 --> 01:14:55,100
The heavier blade, Mr. Bassett.

897
01:14:55,200 --> 01:14:56,200
I implore you.

898
01:14:56,200 --> 01:14:59,800
I am fighting this duel,

01:52:05,600 --> 01:52:07,600
I can love and
have children.

1301
01:52:07,600 --> 01:52:09,500
Live and grow old.

1302
01:52:09,600 --> 01:52:12,000
You never prepared
me for that...

1303
01:52:12,100 --> 01:52:13,500
you Spanish peacock.

1304
01:52:13,600 --> 01:52:15,200
[ Ramirez ]
Ha ha ha ha.

1305
01:52:15,300 --> 01:52:17,400
Patience, Highlander.

1306
01:52:17,400 --> 01:52:19,700
You have done well.

1307
01:52:19,800 --> 01:52:21,900
But it'll take time.

1308
01:52:22,000 --> 01:52:27,400
You are generations
being born and dying.

1309
01:52:27,400 --> 01:52:29,900
You are at one
with all living things.

1310
01:52:30,000 --> 01:52:33,200
Each man's thoughts and dreams
are yours to know.

1311
01:52:34,900 --> 01:52:37,700
You have power beyond imagination.

1312
01:52:37,800 --> 01:52:40,600
Use it well, my friend.

1313
01:52:40,700 --> 01:52:42,700
Don't lose your head.

1314
01:53:22,600 --> 01:53:24,000
~ One dream ~

1315
01:53:24,100 --> 01:53:26,000
~ One source ~

1316
01:53:26,100 --> 01:53:27,900
~ One prize ~

1317
01:53:27,900 --> 01:53:29,500
~ One goal ~

1318
01:53:29,600 --> 01:53:33,500
~ One golden glance ~

1319
01:53:33,600 --> 01:53:37,000
~ Of what should be ~

1320
01:53:37,100 --> 01:53:40,600
~ One shine of light ~

1321
01:53:40,600 --> 01:53:44,500
~ That shows the way ~

1322
01:53:44,600 --> 01:53:48,000
~ No mortal man ~

1323
01:53:48,100 --> 01:53:52,000
~ Can win this day ~

1324
01:53:52,100 --> 01:53:55,600
~ The waiting seems ~

1325
01:53:55,600 --> 01:53:59,200
~ Eternity ~

1326
01:53:59,300 --> 01:54:02,500
~ The day will dawn ~

1327
01:54:02,600 --> 01:54:06,700
~ On sanity ~

1328
01:54:06,800 --> 01:54:10,500
~ Is this a kind ~

1329
01:54:10,600 --> 01:54:12,600
~ Of magic? ~

1330
01:54:14,100 --> 01:54:19,800
~ There can be only one ~

1331
01:54:21,600 --> 01:54:23,000
~ This rage ~

1332
01:54:23,100 --> 01:54:25,200
~ That lasts ~

1333
01:54:25,300 --> 01:54:28,500
~ A thousand years ~

1334
01:54:28,600 --> 01:54:31,600
~ Will soon be done ~

1335
01:54:47,100 --> 01:54:51,000
~ This flame that burns ~

1336
01:54:51,100 --> 01:54:54,400
~ Inside of me ~

1337
01:54:54,400 --> 01:54:56,700
~ I'm hearing ~

1338
01:54:56,800 --> 01:55:02,100
~ Secret harmonies ~

1339
01:55:02,100 --> 01:55:03,600
~ The bell ~

1340
01:55:03,600 --> 01:55:05,600
~ That rings ~

1341
01:55:05,600 --> 01:55:09,500
~ Inside your mind ~

1342
01:55:09,500 --> 01:55:13,500
~ Is charging ~

1343
01:55:13,500 --> 01:55:17,000
~ The doors of time ~

1344
01:55:17,100 --> 01:55:20,500
~ The waiting seems ~

1345
01:55:20,600 --> 01:55:24,100
~ Eternity ~

1346
01:55:24,200 --> 01:55:27,700
~ The day will dawn ~

1347
01:55:27,700 --> 01:55:31,500
~ On sanity ~

1348
01:55:31,600 --> 01:55:33,500
~ This is ~

1349
01:55:33,600 --> 01:55:35,500
~ A kind ~

1350
01:55:35,600 --> 01:55:37,300
~ Of magic ~

1351
01:55:39,100 --> 01:55:46,000
~ There can be only one ~

1352
01:55:46,100 --> 01:55:48,000
~ This rage ~

1353
01:55:48,100 --> 01:55:50,200
~ That lasts ~

1354
01:55:50,300 --> 01:55:53,000
~ A thousand years ~

1355
01:55:53,100 --> 01:55:55,000
~ Will soon be
will soon be ~

1356
01:55:55,100 --> 01:55:57,500
~ Will soon be done ~

1357
01:55:57,600 --> 01:55:59,200
~ This is ~

1358
01:55:59,300 --> 01:56:01,100
~ A kind ~

1359
01:56:01,100 --> 01:56:03,300
~ Of magic ~

1360
01:56:07,800 --> 01:56:10,600
~ A kind of magic ~~
