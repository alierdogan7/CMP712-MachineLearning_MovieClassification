1
00:00:21,567 --> 00:00:24,286
Klytus, l'm bored.

2
00:00:24,447 --> 00:00:27,245
What plaything
can you offer me today?

3
00:00:27,407 --> 00:00:34,279
An obscure body in the SK system.
The inhabitants call it Earth.

4
00:00:35,927 --> 00:00:38,964
How peaceful it looks.

5
00:00:44,727 --> 00:00:47,082
EARTHQUAKE

6
00:00:49,687 --> 00:00:55,683
Most effective, Your Majesty.
Will you destroy this Earth?

7
00:00:55,847 --> 00:01:01,797
Later. l like to play with things ...
before annihilation.

8
00:01:16,087 --> 00:01:17,759
MAlN TlTLE

9
00:03:27,287 --> 00:03:29,403
HOT HAlL

10
00:05:16,927 --> 00:05:20,602
Green Mountain Airways 123
requesting instructions.

11
00:05:20,767 --> 00:05:25,841
l hope Flash Gordon's had
a great vacation after last season.

12
00:05:37,407 --> 00:05:41,195
- Any problem, fellas?
- Just turbulence. Nothing serious.

13
00:05:41,367 --> 00:05:45,201
Nothing you'd want to toss
a third-down pass through either.

14
00:05:45,367 --> 00:05:49,645
Would you like to autograph this
for my kid, Mr. Gordon?

15
00:05:52,807 --> 00:05:56,925
- Call Boston approach.
- lt may be smoother higher up.

16
00:05:57,087 --> 00:06:01,080
Do us a favor and leave them alone.
They're busy driving the bus.

17
00:06:01,887 --> 00:06:05,675
lt's just a little turbulence.

18
00:06:05,847 --> 00:06:09,681
- My name's Flash.
- l know.

19
00:06:09,847 --> 00:06:13,760
l'm sorry if l seemed rude.
l'm just a little scared.

20
00:06:13,927 --> 00:06:18,205
lt's kind of nice.
A travel agent who's scared in planes.

21
00:06:18,367 --> 00:06:21,564
l asked the Matire D' who you were.

22
00:06:24,527 --> 00:06:29,442
- Talk to me. Get my mind off this.
- l couldn't believe you were alone.

23
00:06:29,607 --> 00:06:32,485
- You're just saying that.
- No, l mean it.

24
00:06:32,647 --> 00:06:37,801
- What were you doing there, alone?
- Trying to get my head together.

25
00:06:37,967 --> 00:06:42,563
- By myself, you know?
- l sure do.

26
00:06:43,287 --> 00:06:46,165
lt's okay.
Honestly, it's nothing.

27
00:06:46,327 --> 00:06:49,205
- Famous last words.
- l take flying lessons.

28
00:06:49,367 --> 00:06:53,599
Sometimes air rises above clouds
and you get a ...

29
00:06:54,727 --> 00:06:57,525
What's the matter?

30
00:07:02,367 --> 00:07:05,165
What's happening, Flash?

31
00:07:38,927 --> 00:07:43,876
Dr. Zarkov! There's no sun.
lt's 8:24 in the morning.

32
00:07:44,047 --> 00:07:47,244
- No sun?
- No.

33
00:07:47,407 --> 00:07:50,240
Check the angular vector
of the moon.

34
00:07:51,127 --> 00:07:56,042
<i>There seems to be no reason</i>
<i>for these intergalactic upsets.</i>

35
00:07:56,207 --> 00:08:01,440
<i>only Dr. Hans Zarkov, formerly</i>
<i>of NASA, provided an explanation.</i>

36
00:08:01,607 --> 00:08:06,397
<i>His ideas, however,</i>
<i>have been rejected as irrational.</i>

37
00:08:06,567 --> 00:08:12,437
<i>According to NASA, today's</i>
<i>solar eclipse is no cause for alarm.</i>

38
00:08:12,607 --> 00:08:17,681
<i>A team of scientists has been</i>
<i>in conference with the President.</i>

39
00:08:19,527 --> 00:08:22,599
What do you find?
The moon out of orbit?

40
00:08:22,767 --> 00:08:26,885
By more than <i>tw</i>elve degrees.
lt must be a mistake.

41
00:08:27,047 --> 00:08:31,325
That's no mistake.
lt's an attack.

42
00:08:33,327 --> 00:08:37,366
l've been right all these years.

43
00:08:46,527 --> 00:08:52,762
Fragments of moon rock. Our moon
is subjected to some enormous force.

44
00:08:52,927 --> 00:08:59,036
A kind of energy beam.

45
00:08:59,207 --> 00:09:03,246
Time to go, Munson.
l've got the coordinates, -

46
00:09:03,407 --> 00:09:06,205
- the direction it's coming from.

47
00:09:06,367 --> 00:09:09,359
This is what we've been waiting for.

48
00:09:09,527 --> 00:09:13,998
We'll go up and counter-attack.

49
00:09:14,167 --> 00:09:18,399
You're crazy.
l'm not going up in that.

50
00:09:18,567 --> 00:09:22,845
- l can't handle the capsule alone.
- You'd better try.

51
00:09:23,007 --> 00:09:27,922
- Get your toothbrush and whatever.
- Right, chief.

52
00:09:28,087 --> 00:09:32,763
Munson!
Why are you running away?

53
00:09:34,327 --> 00:09:37,046
All the frequencies are dead.

54
00:09:37,207 --> 00:09:41,280
- Get a look at the V.O.R.
- Holy cow!

55
00:09:42,927 --> 00:09:45,999
John, ten o'clock!

56
00:09:50,207 --> 00:09:53,677
l'll put this baby down right here.

57
00:10:01,447 --> 00:10:04,245
What the hell?

58
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:12,203
- My God, where are the pilots?
- Help me pull her up.

59
00:10:21,007 --> 00:10:23,726
Are we coming up?
l can't see.

60
00:10:23,887 --> 00:10:26,720
Me neither. Look for landing lights.

61
00:10:26,887 --> 00:10:32,041
- This isn't my scene. Look where?
- Hit the switches over there.

62
00:10:32,207 --> 00:10:36,644
Did your flying lessons
get as far as landing?

63
00:10:36,807 --> 00:10:40,402
l was afraid you'd ask that. No.

64
00:10:40,567 --> 00:10:43,684
Hang on, here we go.

65
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:56,876
Munson!

66
00:10:57,047 --> 00:11:00,642
l swear, Munson, l'll shoot!

67
00:11:00,807 --> 00:11:03,799
Get shot, go up,
what's the difference?

68
00:11:03,967 --> 00:11:07,198
You'll give your life to save Earth.

69
00:11:07,367 --> 00:11:11,440
- Haven't you any spirit at all?
- No!

70
00:11:18,727 --> 00:11:22,322
- Dr. Zarkov, listen!
- You're back.

71
00:11:33,767 --> 00:11:37,646
- Dale, you all right?
- l'm terrific.

72
00:11:37,807 --> 00:11:42,039
Let's get out of here
before she blows.

73
00:11:54,647 --> 00:11:58,481
Hold me for a second, then drop me,
l'll kiss the ground.

74
00:11:58,647 --> 00:12:02,686
- You sure you're okay?
- Fine. But no more flying.

75
00:12:05,047 --> 00:12:10,565
- Good morning! Are you injured?
- lt seems not.

76
00:12:10,727 --> 00:12:14,845
A miracle.
l expect you'd like to use my phone?

77
00:12:15,007 --> 00:12:20,286
- l would.
- l'm sure the insurance ...

78
00:12:20,447 --> 00:12:24,599
- Please, don't mention it.
- What happened to the sun?

79
00:12:24,767 --> 00:12:29,921
- Looks like an eclipse.
- There was nothing about it on TV.

80
00:12:30,087 --> 00:12:33,318
The phone is right in there.

81
00:12:40,087 --> 00:12:43,841
Sorry, Munson.
Missed your opportunity.

82
00:12:44,007 --> 00:12:49,001
- Where's the telephone?
- l'm sure that's Dr. Zarkov.

83
00:12:49,167 --> 00:12:51,727
He's a crazy scientist l saw on TV.

84
00:12:51,887 --> 00:12:56,483
He kept talking about an attack.
They kicked him out of NASA ...

85
00:12:56,647 --> 00:12:59,161
- Dr. Zarkov.
- Enough!

86
00:12:59,327 --> 00:13:02,160
- Are you crazy?
- Unfortunately not.

87
00:13:02,327 --> 00:13:08,516
The attack has begun. We have eleven
days before the moon crashes down.

88
00:13:08,687 --> 00:13:13,203
- l need aid in taking off.
- Taking off where?

89
00:13:13,367 --> 00:13:18,646
Up there. l need one person
to keep a foot on that red pedal -

90
00:13:18,807 --> 00:13:23,437
- during blast-off.
You're the lighter. Sit down.

91
00:13:24,687 --> 00:13:29,715
You may leave. Tell the world
what Hans Zarkov has done.

92
00:13:30,647 --> 00:13:34,845
l guess l'll be running along now.
You lunatic!

93
00:13:40,247 --> 00:13:42,477
Flash, the doors!

94
00:14:07,847 --> 00:14:12,637
Sit down! Keep a foot on the pedal,
or the G-forces will kill us all.

95
00:14:12,807 --> 00:14:14,718
My God, we're moving.

96
00:14:16,287 --> 00:14:21,407
For God's sake,
strap yourselves down! Quick!

97
00:14:41,127 --> 00:14:44,085
The red pedal!

98
00:14:46,767 --> 00:14:52,080
Friendship.
Built this to send in friendship ...

99
00:14:54,087 --> 00:14:56,999
The end, now ...

100
00:14:57,167 --> 00:15:03,402
Unless we three can ...
Unless we can ...

101
00:16:11,047 --> 00:16:15,438
Strange object
in the imperial vortex.

102
00:16:15,607 --> 00:16:19,566
What distance?

103
00:16:19,727 --> 00:16:23,845
Parallel to star field Zygma 12,
approaching.

104
00:16:30,527 --> 00:16:34,964
<i>- Test object for life waves.</i>
<i>- Positive, form unknown.</i>

105
00:16:35,127 --> 00:16:37,402
<i>Approximate Mong Scale 3.</i>

106
00:16:42,847 --> 00:16:47,284
<i>object entering our control range,</i>
<i>approaching the Sea of Fire.</i>

107
00:16:47,447 --> 00:16:50,996
<i>Bring it through safely. Land it.</i>

108
00:17:31,447 --> 00:17:34,996
Wake up, Dale. We're okay.

109
00:17:35,167 --> 00:17:39,285
lt's me, Flash. Remember?
We're on the ground.

110
00:17:39,887 --> 00:17:43,562
- Back home?
- l don't think so.

111
00:17:56,007 --> 00:18:00,717
Hello. We're from Earth. Friends.

112
00:18:13,367 --> 00:18:17,599
Whoever they are,
it's clear they are highly developed.

113
00:18:17,767 --> 00:18:21,999
- l'm sure we can reason with them.
- Want to bet on it?

114
00:18:29,087 --> 00:18:33,080
- My God!
- ls this a Civic Reception?

115
00:18:33,247 --> 00:18:37,320
- More like a police state.
- That could be our good luck.

116
00:18:37,487 --> 00:18:40,206
lt means we'll find allies everywhere.

117
00:18:40,367 --> 00:18:44,565
They're just waiting for someone
to lead them in revolt.

118
00:18:44,727 --> 00:18:50,120
- Are you looking at me, Zarkov?
- Please. l just want to get home.

119
00:18:53,127 --> 00:18:57,439
<i>Guards, halt.</i>
<i>Prisoners, follow me.</i>

120
00:19:09,767 --> 00:19:14,477
<i>Halt, Lizard Man!</i>
<i>Escape is impossible. Surrender.</i>

121
00:19:18,607 --> 00:19:22,486
<i>Prisoners, march below me</i>
<i>to Emperor Ming.</i>

122
00:19:22,647 --> 00:19:26,925
Let's not argue. Here, hold my hand.

123
00:19:27,087 --> 00:19:32,366
- You want to reason with that?
- lf it fails, l still have the gun.

124
00:19:32,527 --> 00:19:36,839
Don't worry. l'll make it plain
l'm acting on my own.

125
00:19:37,007 --> 00:19:40,716
- lt's plain suicide.
- lt's a rational transaction.

126
00:19:40,887 --> 00:19:43,799
- One life for billions.
- <i>Halt!</i>

127
00:19:52,087 --> 00:19:54,521
<i>Proceed.</i>

128
00:20:47,607 --> 00:20:52,681
Hail Ming, hail!
Ruler of the universe!

129
00:20:52,847 --> 00:20:57,716
Hail, Ming! Emperor of the galaxy!

130
00:20:57,887 --> 00:21:01,721
The tributes of the Hawkmen
will be first.

131
00:21:04,007 --> 00:21:07,079
- Are we dreaming?
- l'd like to think so.

132
00:21:07,247 --> 00:21:12,640
The fabled lce Jewel of Frigia.

133
00:21:12,807 --> 00:21:16,436
- We seized it in battle.
- Stop!

134
00:21:18,927 --> 00:21:23,523
The lce Jewel is our tribute,
not Vultan's.

135
00:21:24,327 --> 00:21:28,479
Vultan stole it
while we were burying our dead.

136
00:21:28,647 --> 00:21:31,957
- You are a thief.
- What?

137
00:21:34,927 --> 00:21:37,725
Let down your weapons!

138
00:21:39,487 --> 00:21:43,605
No one, but no one,
dies in the palace -

139
00:21:43,767 --> 00:21:47,362
- without a command
from the Emperor.

140
00:21:53,247 --> 00:21:55,886
Hail Ming.

141
00:21:58,767 --> 00:22:04,364
You obey ...
Or you sacrifice your daughter.

142
00:22:12,367 --> 00:22:14,756
Hail Ming.

143
00:22:18,247 --> 00:22:22,286
Now the tributes from Ardentia.

144
00:22:23,647 --> 00:22:27,845
Your Majesty,
we, the people of Ardentia, -

145
00:22:28,007 --> 00:22:31,283
- have suffered
since you blasted our kingdom.

146
00:22:31,447 --> 00:22:35,281
l can offer you nothing
except my loyalty.

147
00:22:35,447 --> 00:22:40,237
Prince Thun,
we prize nothing more highly.

148
00:22:40,407 --> 00:22:45,037
- And how great is this loyalty?
- Without measure.

149
00:22:45,207 --> 00:22:49,758
We are delighted to hear it.
Fall on your sword.

150
00:22:51,647 --> 00:22:56,562
Show us this loyalty.
Throw yourself onto your sword.

151
00:23:12,167 --> 00:23:18,800
May this deed of Prince Thun be an
example to all the kingdoms of Mongo.

152
00:23:18,967 --> 00:23:21,925
Death to Ming!

153
00:23:55,527 --> 00:23:59,645
- This Ming's a psycho.
- <i>This Ming is a psycho.</i>

154
00:23:59,807 --> 00:24:04,961
- Who said that?
<i>- The fair-haired prisoner.</i>

155
00:24:28,687 --> 00:24:30,837
Come along, Fellini.

156
00:24:36,527 --> 00:24:38,518
Remember me?

157
00:24:46,567 --> 00:24:52,085
- Who are you?
- Flash Gordon. Quarterback.

158
00:24:52,247 --> 00:24:57,480
Dale Arden, Your Highness.
Live and let live, that's my motto.

159
00:24:57,647 --> 00:25:03,643
l'm Hans Zarkov. l kidnapped them
in an effort to save our planet Earth.

160
00:25:03,807 --> 00:25:09,757
An obscure body, which has given you
so much amusement recently.

161
00:25:09,927 --> 00:25:15,047
We're only interested in friendship.
Why do you attack us?

162
00:25:15,207 --> 00:25:18,085
Why not?

163
00:25:18,247 --> 00:25:24,561
Pathetic earthlings.
Hurling your bodies into the void, -

164
00:25:24,727 --> 00:25:28,481
- without an inkling of
who or what is out here.

165
00:25:28,647 --> 00:25:34,005
lf you knew anything about
the Universe, you'd hide from it.

166
00:25:35,967 --> 00:25:39,004
Come closer.
Not you!

167
00:25:39,167 --> 00:25:43,604
- You. Let us see you.
- No.

168
00:25:53,767 --> 00:25:56,486
- Dale!
- Don't.

169
00:26:28,367 --> 00:26:33,236
- Did you ever see such response?
- No. Truly.

170
00:26:33,407 --> 00:26:36,479
She even rivals your daughter.

171
00:26:47,487 --> 00:26:51,241
- What happened?
- Don't know, but it was sensational.

172
00:26:51,407 --> 00:26:54,683
Remove the Earth woman.

173
00:26:54,847 --> 00:26:58,886
Prepare her for our pleasure.

174
00:27:01,487 --> 00:27:05,799
Forget it, Ming. Dale's with me.

175
00:27:07,807 --> 00:27:11,800
- Stay back!
- Don't, Flash, they'll kill you.

176
00:27:26,967 --> 00:27:30,926
l'll go with them, just ...
You ..!

177
00:27:58,727 --> 00:28:00,683
Klytus!

178
00:28:01,687 --> 00:28:04,918
Are your men on the right pills?

179
00:28:06,367 --> 00:28:09,962
Maybe you should execute
their trainer.

180
00:28:21,287 --> 00:28:23,562
Come here!

181
00:28:23,727 --> 00:28:28,881
You fools. He's playing some
barbaric game. Match him, like this.

182
00:28:33,247 --> 00:28:37,604
- Forty one! Forty <i>tw</i>o!
- Go, Flash, go.

183
00:28:40,327 --> 00:28:43,399
Go, Flash, go!

184
00:29:15,127 --> 00:29:17,960
Don't kill him yet, Father.

185
00:29:18,127 --> 00:29:22,757
l want him.
Give him to me.

186
00:29:23,407 --> 00:29:26,558
What would Prince Barin say?

187
00:29:26,727 --> 00:29:31,084
l can handle Barin.
Please ...

188
00:29:33,567 --> 00:29:37,162
Really, Aura. Your appetites
are too dangerous. l refuse.

189
00:29:37,327 --> 00:29:43,243
Guards! Deliver the scientist
to General Klytus for conditioning.

190
00:29:43,407 --> 00:29:47,082
This one has defied us
before our subjects.

191
00:29:47,247 --> 00:29:52,037
We order him disposed of tonight
by public execution.

192
00:29:54,487 --> 00:30:00,084
<i>This is a public announcement.</i>
<i>Flash Gordon is to be executed-</i>

193
00:30:00,247 --> 00:30:04,320
<i>- at 29.15 Mingo mean time.</i>

194
00:30:04,487 --> 00:30:09,641
Fly back to your kingdom.
You may see me sooner than you think.

195
00:30:14,087 --> 00:30:18,239
- Lying bitch.
- l'll come.

196
00:30:18,407 --> 00:30:24,084
lf you rocket there right away.
l've a surprise for you.

197
00:30:24,247 --> 00:30:28,718
- Don't you love me?
- l don't trust you.

198
00:30:31,287 --> 00:30:34,438
Just be there.

199
00:30:44,287 --> 00:30:47,404
l demand to see the Governor.

200
00:30:51,087 --> 00:30:54,477
l can hardly breathe in this thing.

201
00:30:55,447 --> 00:31:00,726
Yes, you don't look well. And l'm told
you refused your final meal.

202
00:31:00,887 --> 00:31:05,085
- The chef will be upset.
- Tell him to go to hell!

203
00:31:05,247 --> 00:31:10,844
Gas works more quickly
on an empty stomach. Any requests?

204
00:31:11,007 --> 00:31:16,479
- Let me see Dale right away.
- Oh, dear. How pathetic.

205
00:31:16,647 --> 00:31:19,764
Yes, l anticipated that.

206
00:31:19,927 --> 00:31:23,966
Bring in the Emperor's concubine.

207
00:31:24,127 --> 00:31:29,440
- Oh, my God!
- l said l want to see her!

208
00:31:32,967 --> 00:31:37,757
You have until the sands run out.

209
00:31:42,927 --> 00:31:45,521
Pathetic ...

210
00:31:48,767 --> 00:31:54,364
You look great.
No kidding, you look great.

211
00:31:54,527 --> 00:31:59,726
lt's the eye make-up. l hope
l remember the trick when l wake up.

212
00:31:59,887 --> 00:32:03,402
That's exactly
what l was gonna tell you.

213
00:32:03,567 --> 00:32:08,004
This isn't happening.
lt's just a bad dream.

214
00:32:08,167 --> 00:32:10,158
l agree completely.

215
00:32:10,327 --> 00:32:15,355
We'll wake up any minute
in Dark Harbor and laugh about this.

216
00:32:16,327 --> 00:32:21,117
Only, next time l'll walk over
and talk to you.

217
00:32:21,287 --> 00:32:25,838
- Promise?
- Cross my heart and hope to ...

218
00:32:26,767 --> 00:32:31,522
- l really will talk to you, Dale.
- What if we're wrong?

219
00:32:31,687 --> 00:32:36,920
- What if it isn't a dream?
- You'll find Zarkov, save the Earth.

220
00:32:37,087 --> 00:32:41,558
He'll get you home in the capsule.
Don't think of me, think of ...

221
00:32:43,527 --> 00:32:46,121
Don't look at it.

222
00:32:48,847 --> 00:32:53,079
lt won't turn over ...
lt won't turn over.

223
00:33:44,127 --> 00:33:49,042
Did you enjoy yourselves on Sybaria?
l hear you flew the Doctor there.

224
00:33:49,207 --> 00:33:53,325
Klytus kindly fed me the information.

225
00:33:53,487 --> 00:33:57,366
He wants me himself. His agents
are always making up lies about me.

226
00:34:34,447 --> 00:34:39,840
Look!
Water is leaking from her eyes.

227
00:34:40,007 --> 00:34:44,683
lt's what they call tears,
a sign of their weakness.

228
00:35:01,087 --> 00:35:03,965
This will help you on your way.

229
00:35:27,887 --> 00:35:30,401
Flash!

230
00:35:55,647 --> 00:35:59,276
FLASH GORDON -
EARTHLlNG EXECUTED BY MlNG

231
00:36:14,407 --> 00:36:16,477
Hurry.

232
00:36:23,127 --> 00:36:27,803
You know what happens
if l'm found out.

233
00:36:27,967 --> 00:36:31,403
l'm a fool for you, Aura.

234
00:36:32,687 --> 00:36:36,646
There we are. Sybaria again,
same place, next weekend?

235
00:36:36,807 --> 00:36:39,605
l can hardly wait.

236
00:37:04,167 --> 00:37:10,356
- Where am l?
- Back from the dead. l saved you.

237
00:37:10,527 --> 00:37:14,486
- How?
- By magic, of course.

238
00:37:14,647 --> 00:37:19,801
- With a kiss, because l like you.
- Where's Dale and Zarkov?

239
00:37:19,967 --> 00:37:25,439
They're safe. Put this uniform on
before the Lizard Men come.

240
00:37:27,607 --> 00:37:30,804
Don't worry, l won't look.

241
00:37:32,527 --> 00:37:34,802
l like you a lot.

242
00:37:40,727 --> 00:37:44,515
- Where are you taking me?
- To the moon Arboria.

243
00:37:44,687 --> 00:37:47,759
l've got to rescue my friends
and save Earth.

244
00:37:47,927 --> 00:37:52,205
Pretty risky telling that
to the Emperor's daughter.

245
00:37:54,967 --> 00:37:59,006
- What's in Arboria?
- People who'll help you.

246
00:37:59,167 --> 00:38:02,955
- Prince Barin does anything l ask.
- That's Zarkov!

247
00:38:06,327 --> 00:38:10,445
They're just conditioning him
to our climate. Keep out of sight.

248
00:38:14,527 --> 00:38:20,523
Every thousand years l test
each life system in the universe.

249
00:38:20,687 --> 00:38:26,717
l visit it with mysteries,
earthquakes, unpredicted eclipses.

250
00:38:27,487 --> 00:38:30,604
Strange craters in the wilderness.

251
00:38:30,767 --> 00:38:35,443
lf these are taken as natural, l judge
that system ignorant and harmless.

252
00:38:35,607 --> 00:38:42,080
l spare it. But if the hand of Ming
is recognized in these events, -

253
00:38:42,247 --> 00:38:49,483
- l judge that system dangerous.
l call upon the great god Dyzan.

254
00:38:49,647 --> 00:38:55,722
And for his greater glory,
and our mutual pleasure ...

255
00:38:58,047 --> 00:39:01,323
l destroy it utterly.

256
00:39:01,487 --> 00:39:06,561
So it's my fault
Earth is being destroyed?

257
00:39:06,727 --> 00:39:09,719
Precisely, Doctor.

258
00:39:11,607 --> 00:39:17,079
l thought it might amuse you to
know this, before your mind is gone.

259
00:39:19,687 --> 00:39:22,155
Proceed with it.

260
00:39:27,527 --> 00:39:31,042
What are you doing to me?

261
00:39:31,207 --> 00:39:34,677
We're just emptying your mind.

262
00:39:34,847 --> 00:39:40,205
We are going to empty your memory
as we might empty your pockets ...

263
00:39:41,087 --> 00:39:46,207
- Doctor ...
- No, don't. Please. l beg you.

264
00:39:46,367 --> 00:39:51,361
My mind is all l have. l've spent
my whole life trying to fill it.

265
00:39:51,527 --> 00:39:54,200
Begin.

266
00:40:37,367 --> 00:40:39,961
Now he showed promise.

267
00:40:56,527 --> 00:40:59,166
Papa!

268
00:41:21,367 --> 00:41:24,404
- Hold it there.
- Reprogram now?

269
00:41:24,567 --> 00:41:27,206
Yes.

270
00:41:28,127 --> 00:41:33,247
But don't fill him with anything above
level three. His mind can't take it.

271
00:41:33,407 --> 00:41:36,399
l understand. Level three only.

272
00:41:36,567 --> 00:41:39,161
l have to attend to something.

273
00:41:39,327 --> 00:41:44,037
- Can you manage without me?
- l'll try.

274
00:41:44,207 --> 00:41:46,596
l'll return.

275
00:41:47,967 --> 00:41:50,322
Begin to reprogram.

276
00:41:52,527 --> 00:41:57,203
Continue to level six.
l gave you an order.

277
00:41:57,367 --> 00:42:00,564
Program the subject to level six.

278
00:42:12,567 --> 00:42:15,206
Try again.

279
00:42:15,367 --> 00:42:21,397
Your left hand controls direction,
right does the altitude.

280
00:42:22,887 --> 00:42:26,243
And use your fingers too this time.

281
00:42:30,727 --> 00:42:35,403
Gently, darling,
it's extremely sensitive ...

282
00:42:35,567 --> 00:42:39,196
- Like me.
- What's that?

283
00:42:39,367 --> 00:42:42,359
The planet Aquaria.

284
00:42:48,087 --> 00:42:53,559
Now take a left over Frigia,
the next moon rising.

285
00:42:56,767 --> 00:43:03,400
Every moon of Mongo is a kingdom.
My father keeps them fighting.

286
00:43:03,567 --> 00:43:08,766
lt's a really brilliant strategy.

287
00:43:08,927 --> 00:43:14,399
- Why don't they team up against him?
- Team up? What does that mean?

288
00:43:14,567 --> 00:43:19,004
- Maybe l'll show you sometime.
- Wonderful.

289
00:43:19,167 --> 00:43:23,718
You can do it
when l take you to Cythera.

290
00:43:23,887 --> 00:43:28,165
lt's my secret pleasure moon.
l have a little palace there, -

291
00:43:28,327 --> 00:43:31,399
-just for <i>tw</i>o.

292
00:43:31,567 --> 00:43:35,355
- Wait a minute.
- Oh, Flash, l saved your life.

293
00:43:45,767 --> 00:43:49,726
Drink this.
lt has no name.

294
00:43:49,887 --> 00:43:54,165
Many brave men died to bring it here
from the Galaxy of Pleasure.

295
00:43:54,327 --> 00:43:59,606
lt will make your nights with Ming
more agreeable.

296
00:43:59,767 --> 00:44:02,327
- Will it make me forget?
- No.

297
00:44:02,487 --> 00:44:06,116
But it will make you not mind
remembering.

298
00:44:15,087 --> 00:44:17,806
This isn't bad at all.

299
00:44:23,087 --> 00:44:28,923
lt's a thought amplifier. l'm going to
think to Barin to expect us.

300
00:44:29,087 --> 00:44:32,875
- You're kidding. Think to him?
- Of course.

301
00:44:33,047 --> 00:44:38,599
- Don't you have telepathy on Earth?
- Could l call Dale on this?

302
00:44:38,767 --> 00:44:44,080
- lf l showed you how. But l won't.
- Please, show me.

303
00:44:44,247 --> 00:44:49,002
You'll have to persuade me
much better than that.

304
00:44:52,327 --> 00:44:57,765
What are you doing? Are you mad?
Let go, we're diving into Frigia.

305
00:44:57,927 --> 00:45:02,125
- Pull up.
- Just tune me in to Dale.

306
00:45:10,167 --> 00:45:15,446
<i>Dale, it's me, Flash.</i>
<i>Are you getting me?</i>

307
00:45:17,047 --> 00:45:22,963
Oh, my head.
lf it only was you.

308
00:45:23,127 --> 00:45:28,679
- She's not getting me.
- Use your brain.

309
00:45:30,807 --> 00:45:36,120
<i>l'm with you, Dale. Just concentrate</i>
<i>hard. lt's telepathy.</i>

310
00:45:36,287 --> 00:45:40,963
<i>Can this be real?</i>
<i>l saw you executed.</i>

311
00:45:41,127 --> 00:45:46,565
<i>- l was saved.</i>
<i>- Thank God. Where are you?</i>

312
00:45:46,727 --> 00:45:51,278
<i>ln a rocket to Arboria, to get help.</i>
<i>Are you okay?</i>

313
00:45:51,447 --> 00:45:56,965
<i>- l'm locked in Ming's bedroom.</i>
<i>- Fake him out. Girls know how.</i>

314
00:45:57,127 --> 00:46:00,802
lt's been done to me.
<i>Fake him out till l get back</i>.

315
00:46:00,967 --> 00:46:05,597
<i>lt's too dangerous for you here.</i>
<i>Stay where you're safe.</i>

316
00:46:05,767 --> 00:46:10,795
<i>- This girl really turns me on ...</i>
<i>- l didn't quite get that.</i>

317
00:46:12,247 --> 00:46:17,082
<i>- lt wasn't about you.</i>
<i>- What?</i>

318
00:46:17,247 --> 00:46:21,240
<i>l've got to go, someone's coming.</i>
<i>Got to stop thinking to each other.</i>

319
00:46:24,447 --> 00:46:29,043
His lmperial Highness
will be here very soon.

320
00:46:29,207 --> 00:46:32,597
- Shall l pour?
- Please.

321
00:46:34,367 --> 00:46:40,237
- Wouldn't you like a sip?
- No, it's forbidden for us slaves.

322
00:46:40,407 --> 00:46:44,446
lt's quality stuff, have some.

323
00:46:45,687 --> 00:46:50,715
We're all girls here, l won't tell.
Just one sip.

324
00:46:50,887 --> 00:46:53,845
Live a little.

325
00:47:01,207 --> 00:47:03,562
Bottoms up.

326
00:47:07,887 --> 00:47:10,879
- What is your name?
- Hans Zarkov.

327
00:47:11,047 --> 00:47:16,644
Agent Zarkov! Number 2133 of the
Anti-lnsurgent Espionage Group.

328
00:47:16,807 --> 00:47:19,480
Hail Ming.

329
00:47:19,647 --> 00:47:21,763
Good.

330
00:47:47,247 --> 00:47:51,638
- lt's not usually so bad.
- How far to the landing pad?

331
00:47:51,807 --> 00:47:55,277
Six point four. l'll drop the flaps.

332
00:48:49,887 --> 00:48:52,196
You?

333
00:49:09,447 --> 00:49:11,881
Over here.

334
00:49:16,567 --> 00:49:18,842
Hey buddy!

335
00:50:14,847 --> 00:50:20,319
l've got her.
Sector 409 beta.

336
00:50:20,487 --> 00:50:23,445
Activate Agent Zarkov.

337
00:50:41,327 --> 00:50:45,240
<i>Dr. Zarkov.</i>
<i>You're a sight for sore eyes.</i>

338
00:50:45,407 --> 00:50:49,161
<i>- Rest a minute.</i>
<i>- l can't.</i>

339
00:50:49,327 --> 00:50:52,717
<i>We've got to join up with Flash.</i>
<i>He's alive.</i>

340
00:50:52,887 --> 00:50:57,199
<i>l talked to him by telepathy.</i>
<i>He went to Arboria to get help.</i>

341
00:50:57,367 --> 00:51:01,076
<i>- lncredible.</i>
<i>- There's soldiers everywhere.</i>

342
00:51:01,247 --> 00:51:03,966
<i>- Let me think a moment.</i>
- Unseal the city.

343
00:51:04,127 --> 00:51:10,123
- Allow her to exit with Zarkov.
- <i>l think l can find a way out.</i>

344
00:51:10,287 --> 00:51:13,085
<i>No questions, just follow me.</i>

345
00:51:17,967 --> 00:51:22,006
Dale Arden is under the guidance
of Agent Zarkov.

346
00:51:22,167 --> 00:51:27,799
- But Flash Gordon is still alive.
- He was revived by a traitor.

347
00:51:27,967 --> 00:51:32,279
And spirited from the city.
We know this from the Earth girl.

348
00:51:32,447 --> 00:51:38,079
- What traitor?
- l have my suspicions.

349
00:51:38,247 --> 00:51:42,001
- Stop at nothing.
- No matter to whom the trail leads?

350
00:51:42,167 --> 00:51:45,204
l said at nothing.

351
00:51:57,727 --> 00:52:01,003
- What's that?
- Their sacred temple.

352
00:52:01,167 --> 00:52:06,321
A young man is being initiated.
But we must hide till it's done.

353
00:52:37,607 --> 00:52:39,723
l love initiations.

354
00:52:48,007 --> 00:52:51,966
l am now of age, Green Father.
l ask for the test of manhood.

355
00:52:52,127 --> 00:52:57,838
Choose your passage,
into this world, or the next.

356
00:52:58,007 --> 00:53:01,556
May Arbor guide you.

357
00:53:56,967 --> 00:54:00,403
Send me on my way.

358
00:54:00,567 --> 00:54:05,197
- Spare me the madness.
- l will. Hold him.

359
00:54:12,127 --> 00:54:16,279
- This guy is going to help me?
- Stay.

360
00:54:22,567 --> 00:54:28,039
That was extremely moving.
l do sometimes keep a promise.

361
00:54:33,967 --> 00:54:38,836
- Prepare a feast.
- No, l have to get back right away.

362
00:54:39,007 --> 00:54:45,082
- Then why did you come?
- l brought you a present. Flash?

363
00:54:52,567 --> 00:54:55,479
Welcome back from the grave.

364
00:54:55,647 --> 00:54:58,684
l knew you were up to something,
but not necrophilia.

365
00:54:58,847 --> 00:55:02,601
Just keep him for me until my father
has had his way with Dale Arden.

366
00:55:02,767 --> 00:55:07,761
l'll keep him all right! ln my larder.
Take him, with the rest of the meat.

367
00:55:07,927 --> 00:55:13,638
l forbid it. lf you kill Flash,
you'll never have me again.

368
00:55:14,647 --> 00:55:19,323
What danger is there?
Everyone thinks he's dead.

369
00:55:19,487 --> 00:55:24,356
- l'll take him to Cythera next week.
- Harboring a fugitive is treason.

370
00:55:24,527 --> 00:55:28,361
You're not frightened of Ming.

371
00:55:30,407 --> 00:55:34,525
- You are playing with fire, Aura.
- Of course l am.

372
00:55:42,487 --> 00:55:43,761
Does anyone ever trust her <i>tw</i>ice?

373
00:55:45,327 --> 00:55:48,842
So they let us escape because Klytus
thought he erased your memory.

374
00:55:49,007 --> 00:55:56,846
Do you know why it failed? l started
to recite Shakespeare, the Talmud, -

375
00:55:57,007 --> 00:56:04,243
- Einstein, anything l could remember,
even The Beatles. lt armored me.

376
00:56:04,407 --> 00:56:09,527
They couldn't wipe those things away.
You can't beat the human spirit.

377
00:56:16,327 --> 00:56:21,959
Prince Barin! l'm not your enemy,
Ming is. And you know it.

378
00:56:22,127 --> 00:56:27,326
Ming is the enemy of every creature
on Mongo. Let's team up and fight him.

379
00:56:29,647 --> 00:56:32,684
Lower them into the swamp.

380
00:56:34,527 --> 00:56:36,757
We can do it, Barin!

381
00:57:00,487 --> 00:57:05,242
Your lover Barin is harboring
Gordon, is he not?

382
00:57:05,407 --> 00:57:07,762
This lying is such a waste of time.

383
00:57:07,927 --> 00:57:13,081
You left with a pilot and returned
alone. Wasn't he Gordon?

384
00:57:14,407 --> 00:57:18,719
Who do you think you're protecting?
The lmperial Surgeon?

385
00:57:18,887 --> 00:57:23,756
- Another lover of yours!
- Yourjealousy has made you mad.

386
00:57:23,927 --> 00:57:27,602
Seize the surgeon
on suspicion of treason.

387
00:57:27,767 --> 00:57:31,965
- Prepare him for torture!
- Confess and we won't hurt you.

388
00:57:32,127 --> 00:57:36,359
- We don't like doing this at all.
- Never!

389
00:57:36,527 --> 00:57:40,122
Bring me the bore worms.

390
00:57:40,287 --> 00:57:44,246
No! Not the bore worms.

391
00:57:47,767 --> 00:57:52,443
l'm a princess. My father
will have your head for this.

392
00:57:52,607 --> 00:57:59,399
He'll execute your whole perverted
secret police. l demand to see him!

393
00:58:00,647 --> 00:58:03,400
With pleasure.

394
00:58:08,767 --> 00:58:12,999
- Father ...
- The traitor is close to confession.

395
00:58:13,167 --> 00:58:17,160
Should we stop the torture?

396
00:58:17,327 --> 00:58:21,115
- No.
- Damn you, father!

397
00:58:27,247 --> 00:58:32,446
- That damn woman's using me again.
- What do you expect?

398
00:58:32,607 --> 00:58:37,886
- l don't know what you see in her.
- Keep playing, fool.

399
00:58:39,887 --> 00:58:46,156
- Fico, l'm going to kill Gordon now.
- And lose the princess forever?

400
00:58:46,327 --> 00:58:52,596
There must be a way to dispose of him
and keep faith with the princess.

401
00:58:52,767 --> 00:58:58,558
- l'm sorry, Flash, l'm finished.
- No, you're not. Get up.

402
00:58:58,727 --> 00:59:02,003
Look, someone's coming.

403
00:59:06,647 --> 00:59:10,242
Send him over. Hurry up.

404
00:59:10,407 --> 00:59:14,719
lt's no good, Flash.
l can't hold on.

405
00:59:14,887 --> 00:59:17,845
Go on, get in.

406
00:59:19,527 --> 00:59:23,406
Sleep well, you traitor.
We hang you in the morning.

407
00:59:30,447 --> 00:59:33,917
- There's always hope.
- This is better.

408
00:59:34,087 --> 00:59:38,444
l stole the key.
We need weapons to cross the swamp.

409
00:59:38,607 --> 00:59:42,043
They're stored in the temple.
Want to climb up with me?

410
00:59:42,207 --> 00:59:45,085
Hold on, Hawkman.

411
00:59:48,487 --> 00:59:52,082
Nice confession. l commend you.

412
00:59:52,247 --> 00:59:57,605
- Execute her.
- No. Too kind.

413
00:59:57,767 --> 01:00:01,362
Aura will be banished to Frigia
after my wedding.

414
01:00:01,527 --> 01:00:06,078
One year in a cavern of ice
will cool her blood.

415
01:00:07,607 --> 01:00:11,646
And then, who knows?

416
01:00:11,807 --> 01:00:17,404
Perhaps we'll marry her to someone
worthy of her treacherous nature.

417
01:00:17,567 --> 01:00:24,962
- How can l express my gratitude?
- Easily. Get me Gordon and Barin.

418
01:00:29,727 --> 01:00:30,682
With pleasure.

419
01:00:53,327 --> 01:00:56,000
Hans, look!

420
01:01:07,247 --> 01:01:11,798
- Hey Vultan!
- Not now.

421
01:01:11,967 --> 01:01:15,721
You'll love this.
See what Brave Blue has caught.

422
01:01:15,887 --> 01:01:19,004
Prince Vultan. Remember us?

423
01:01:20,447 --> 01:01:25,157
lndeed l do, my lovely.

424
01:01:25,327 --> 01:01:29,798
Call the Emperor.
Tell him l have prisoners.

425
01:01:29,967 --> 01:01:33,323
- You wouldn't!
- Are you mad, Vultan?

426
01:01:33,487 --> 01:01:39,278
You hate Ming. You're only waiting
for the moment to attack.

427
01:01:39,447 --> 01:01:42,484
Yes, and Ming knows it, too.

428
01:01:42,647 --> 01:01:47,880
By delivering you,
l allay his suspicions.

429
01:01:48,047 --> 01:01:53,679
- l gain time.
- Our weapons are inferior.

430
01:01:53,847 --> 01:01:58,079
Ming's not unbeatable.
He couldn't even kill Flash.

431
01:01:58,247 --> 01:02:03,560
- Gordon's alive?
- ln Arboria with Prince Barin.

432
01:02:03,727 --> 01:02:05,957
l tell you, now is the time to strike.

433
01:02:18,167 --> 01:02:21,603
- Where are the weapons?
- Feel one.

434
01:02:29,007 --> 01:02:33,956
- Do you know where you are?
- Up the creek.

435
01:02:34,127 --> 01:02:37,437
You've trespassed.

436
01:02:37,607 --> 01:02:43,955
A stranger in this temple
must try the Wood Beast, or die ...

437
01:02:44,127 --> 01:02:46,687
That figures.

438
01:02:49,007 --> 01:02:53,319
You came here of your own free will.
However, -

439
01:02:53,487 --> 01:02:59,084
- because of my word to Aura,
l swear by Arbor l'll not kill you ...

440
01:03:00,247 --> 01:03:03,080
Unless you beg me to.

441
01:03:04,087 --> 01:03:08,046
The Beast lies somewhere
in the stump. Choose a passage.

442
01:03:08,207 --> 01:03:10,437
No way.

443
01:03:15,807 --> 01:03:19,197
- Coward.
- Let's do it.

444
01:03:35,047 --> 01:03:38,517
Must be my lucky day.

445
01:03:38,687 --> 01:03:41,076
You scared?

446
01:03:49,447 --> 01:03:52,678
What would Aura think of you now?

447
01:04:03,687 --> 01:04:06,645
Second down.

448
01:04:12,327 --> 01:04:14,761
Your play.

449
01:04:14,927 --> 01:04:18,124
No, yours.

450
01:04:18,967 --> 01:04:24,644
- Are you sure these are the rules?
- They've just been changed.

451
01:04:47,807 --> 01:04:52,164
Death is certain,
but only after tortured madness.

452
01:04:52,327 --> 01:04:56,525
- How long?
- lt depends on your strength.

453
01:04:57,487 --> 01:05:01,275
Please, end it now.

454
01:05:03,087 --> 01:05:08,115
Tricked you, Barin.
Back off!

455
01:05:08,287 --> 01:05:12,519
One move and you're looking
for a new prince.

456
01:05:15,447 --> 01:05:20,680
Leave him! He's mine.
l hunt him alone.

457
01:06:51,487 --> 01:06:54,126
What the hell is going on?

458
01:07:19,287 --> 01:07:23,644
This is one grave
you won't be returning from.

459
01:07:27,007 --> 01:07:28,281
Vultan wants a word.

460
01:07:47,767 --> 01:07:52,795
Excuse me for waking you. We scanned
a Hawkman patrol 400 Mongo miles east.

461
01:07:52,967 --> 01:07:56,004
They have Gordon and Prince Barin.

462
01:07:58,487 --> 01:08:03,641
- When do we reach Vultan's kingdom?
- Estimating sixteen.

463
01:08:03,807 --> 01:08:07,083
Wake me when it's in sight.

464
01:08:15,647 --> 01:08:20,243
- You'd sell us to Ming?
- Come on, Barin.

465
01:08:20,407 --> 01:08:25,925
Do you expect mercy here? What
would you do if l were your captive?

466
01:08:26,087 --> 01:08:30,683
Remind you of
Article 1<i>7</i> of Ming's Law:

467
01:08:30,847 --> 01:08:34,635
''No prince of Mongo
shall be offered for ransom -

468
01:08:34,807 --> 01:08:38,197
- without trial by combat.''

469
01:08:38,367 --> 01:08:43,361
ls there such an article?
What a damned nuisance.

470
01:08:44,127 --> 01:08:50,441
- And ... who do you choose to fight?
- Him.

471
01:08:54,047 --> 01:08:56,766
This is a lunatic asylum.

472
01:08:57,647 --> 01:09:01,799
- Where are we being taken now?
- Ssh, l'm calculating.

473
01:09:01,967 --> 01:09:07,803
Time remaining before the moon crashes
on Earth. l'd say, roughly ...

474
01:09:08,007 --> 01:09:11,522
Fourteen hours, nine minutes
and <i>tw</i>enty seconds.

475
01:09:11,687 --> 01:09:14,963
And we haven't even found ...
Flash!

476
01:09:20,287 --> 01:09:24,599
Last time l saw you
l prayed it was a dream.

477
01:09:24,767 --> 01:09:29,795
This time l pray it's not.
Are you okay? Me too.

478
01:09:29,967 --> 01:09:35,837
- l've got some crazy stories to tell.
- Save them for our kids.

479
01:09:36,007 --> 01:09:41,639
- Enough!
- Leave us alone! l just got engaged.

480
01:09:54,367 --> 01:09:58,963
Let the combat begin! To the death.

481
01:10:32,127 --> 01:10:34,925
Give me the remote control.

482
01:10:39,127 --> 01:10:41,766
Come on!

483
01:10:46,367 --> 01:10:48,756
He's tilting it.

484
01:10:57,087 --> 01:10:59,282
Watch out!

485
01:11:14,607 --> 01:11:18,361
- Present from Vultan.
- Brute! Give me that.

486
01:11:18,527 --> 01:11:21,519
- Bastard!
- Flash!

487
01:11:27,727 --> 01:11:30,924
Come on, finish him.

488
01:12:03,127 --> 01:12:06,722
Flash! l love you.

489
01:12:06,887 --> 01:12:10,800
But we only have 14 hours
to save the Earth.

490
01:12:26,207 --> 01:12:28,721
How's that feel, Arborian?

491
01:12:39,207 --> 01:12:44,679
lf you kill me, promise to team up
with Vultan and fight Ming.

492
01:12:47,847 --> 01:12:49,963
Goodbye, Barin.

493
01:12:56,967 --> 01:13:01,597
- Take my hand.
- You've won, let him go.

494
01:13:11,847 --> 01:13:14,077
That's it, Prince.

495
01:13:17,327 --> 01:13:20,842
- What is this?
- Humanity.

496
01:13:41,687 --> 01:13:44,963
Where you go, l follow.

497
01:13:48,407 --> 01:13:51,843
Listen to me!

498
01:13:52,647 --> 01:13:56,925
There is something finer
in this galaxy than Ming's law.

499
01:13:57,087 --> 01:13:59,647
Rubbish!

500
01:14:05,527 --> 01:14:08,485
Hawkmen, to your posts!

501
01:14:30,727 --> 01:14:34,322
Agent Zarkov,
you will be liquidated for treachery.

502
01:14:34,487 --> 01:14:38,765
Vultan!
Surrender the fugitives at once, -

503
01:14:38,927 --> 01:14:42,317
- or the lmperial Fleet will blast
your kingdom to atoms.

504
01:14:46,647 --> 01:14:49,525
- Step forward, Barin.
- <i>Prince</i> Barin.

505
01:14:49,687 --> 01:14:55,603
Princess Aura has implicated you
on a charge of high treason.

506
01:14:55,767 --> 01:14:59,362
- A prison ship will take you away.
- You tortured Aura.

507
01:14:59,527 --> 01:15:03,076
lnteresting girl. l think
she found it rather enjoyable.

508
01:15:03,247 --> 01:15:05,715
Klytus.

509
01:15:23,247 --> 01:15:26,762
The first step forward.

510
01:15:26,927 --> 01:15:32,240
lnto the air, Hawkpeople.
Fly for your lives!

511
01:15:32,407 --> 01:15:37,925
You damned hothead, you brought down
destruction on my kingdom.

512
01:15:38,087 --> 01:15:41,318
He showed us the way.
Fight with us.

513
01:15:41,487 --> 01:15:45,844
- Against the lmperial Fleet?
- They won't expect resistance.

514
01:15:46,007 --> 01:15:48,885
- We'll take them by surprise.
- We can do it.

515
01:15:49,047 --> 01:15:56,078
You're all mad! My duty is
to protect my people. Evacuate!

516
01:15:56,247 --> 01:16:00,798
- Then take us with you.
- lmpossible, we can't carry more.

517
01:16:00,967 --> 01:16:04,437
- You're leaving us to die?
- You know Ming's law.

518
01:16:04,607 --> 01:16:08,725
Outside his own kingdom,
the hunter becomes the hunted.

519
01:16:08,887 --> 01:16:14,041
- Traitor!
- Save your breath. Fly!

520
01:16:21,727 --> 01:16:24,002
Help me pull these down.

521
01:16:24,167 --> 01:16:27,159
We'll make parachutes
and jump to Arboria.

522
01:16:27,327 --> 01:16:29,443
We'll kill ourselves.

523
01:16:29,607 --> 01:16:33,885
A body reaches maximum velocity
within a few hundred feet.

524
01:16:34,047 --> 01:16:39,997
- We'll need some rope.
- My God, what is that?

525
01:16:42,087 --> 01:16:47,002
lt's Ming.
We must stop him.

526
01:16:54,287 --> 01:16:57,882
- Blast them?
- Not yet. Send down a shuttle.

527
01:16:58,047 --> 01:17:02,086
- Bring back Barin, Zarkov and Dale.
- And Gordon?

528
01:17:02,247 --> 01:17:06,240
Leave him there.
Prepare my lmperial Lander.

529
01:17:13,367 --> 01:17:16,120
Why aren't l going with them?

530
01:17:17,127 --> 01:17:21,917
- l've got other plans for you.
- l can imagine.

531
01:17:23,287 --> 01:17:29,965
- You want to destroy me.
- lt's the only way to save Earth.

532
01:17:31,047 --> 01:17:35,563
- What if l granted you a kingdom?
- lf you what?

533
01:17:37,247 --> 01:17:41,718
Ming the Merciless,
ruler of the universe, -

534
01:17:41,887 --> 01:17:47,757
- offers Flash Gordon a kingdom
of Mongo, to rule over as his own.

535
01:17:48,807 --> 01:17:54,040
You're crazy. Why would you do that?

536
01:17:54,207 --> 01:17:58,803
Because l've never met your like.
You're a hero, don't you see that?

537
01:17:58,967 --> 01:18:05,679
Who better to rule a kingdom?
Your moon is very close now.

538
01:18:06,727 --> 01:18:12,643
- Earth's end might come within hours.
- You'd call off the attack?

539
01:18:12,807 --> 01:18:15,605
- l could.
- Everyone would be saved?

540
01:18:15,767 --> 01:18:19,237
Yes, and no.

541
01:18:21,407 --> 01:18:26,083
After the earthquakes and tidal waves,
they won't be the same human beings.

542
01:18:26,247 --> 01:18:31,241
They'll be more tractable. Easier
for you to rule, in the name of Ming.

543
01:18:31,407 --> 01:18:38,358
- You mean slaves?
- Let's say 'satisfied with less'.

544
01:18:40,687 --> 01:18:46,637
- What about Dale?
- We have decided to marry her.

545
01:18:47,527 --> 01:18:50,883
She's exceptional.
We'll breed with her -

546
01:18:51,047 --> 01:18:56,246
- and send our progeny back
to populate your Earth.

547
01:18:56,407 --> 01:19:02,801
Do you really prefer death
to a kingdom? l'm disappointed.

548
01:19:02,967 --> 01:19:08,246
l'd rather see you on my side
than scattered into ...

549
01:19:11,327 --> 01:19:13,921
Atoms.

550
01:19:14,087 --> 01:19:17,716
But as you wish.

551
01:19:20,287 --> 01:19:25,884
We'll return to the lmperial Rocket.
Leave the Earthling here to his doom.

552
01:19:39,087 --> 01:19:42,602
- Beam another blast.
- You murderer.

553
01:20:19,367 --> 01:20:22,564
Flash. l loved you.

554
01:20:28,847 --> 01:20:32,726
- They were brave creatures.
- Shut up!

555
01:20:32,887 --> 01:20:39,201
With respect, the man who rid us
of Klytus should not be deserted.

556
01:20:39,367 --> 01:20:45,681
So ... maybe l'd do it different
if l had it over again.

557
01:20:45,847 --> 01:20:52,320
- Then fight.
- l can't help a man who's dead!

558
01:20:52,487 --> 01:20:57,197
Flash Gordon to Vultan.
Mayday, mayday.

559
01:20:59,007 --> 01:21:03,683
This is Vultan. l read you.
Where are you?

560
01:21:03,847 --> 01:21:10,559
- Flying blind on a rocket cycle.
- Flying blind on a rocket cycle?

561
01:21:11,367 --> 01:21:16,122
We're in Arboria.
l'll send you a homing beam.

562
01:21:16,287 --> 01:21:20,599
For what it's worth,
Ming's got Dale, Zarkov and Barin.

563
01:21:22,287 --> 01:21:27,486
- l see. My thanks to you.
- What for?

564
01:21:27,647 --> 01:21:32,721
Well ... for giving a dumb old bird
a second chance.

565
01:21:32,887 --> 01:21:35,879
Over to homing beam.

566
01:21:49,127 --> 01:21:51,641
Don't touch me!

567
01:21:53,847 --> 01:21:57,635
- You!
- Stop! l'm a prisoner too.

568
01:21:57,807 --> 01:22:03,165
Damned Mongo person! You couldn't
tell the truth to save your life.

569
01:22:06,127 --> 01:22:11,679
- Stop! l'm going to be exiled.
- Liar!

570
01:22:11,847 --> 01:22:14,407
Liar.

571
01:22:21,127 --> 01:22:26,599
- ls this another trick, Aura?
- ls this a trick?

572
01:22:28,327 --> 01:22:33,355
Could l cry
if my heart hadn't changed?

573
01:22:33,527 --> 01:22:38,999
l've been such a spoiled fool.
l never knew what my father was ...

574
01:22:39,167 --> 01:22:43,206
Until he let Klytus use bore worms.

575
01:22:43,367 --> 01:22:48,395
l believe you.
But l don't trust you.

576
01:22:48,567 --> 01:22:53,766
You're of Ming's blood. You'll cosy up
with him again in the morning.

577
01:22:53,927 --> 01:22:58,603
Not if you give him this.
lt's deadly poison.

578
01:22:58,767 --> 01:23:02,726
He always drinks a power potion
before making love.

579
01:23:02,887 --> 01:23:09,281
- Drop this into his glass tonight.
- l can't. l gave him my word.

580
01:23:09,447 --> 01:23:13,440
- What word?
- To be a good wife ...

581
01:23:13,607 --> 01:23:17,202
lf he'd spare Zarkov and Barin.
He vowed he would.

582
01:23:17,367 --> 01:23:22,236
My father has never kept a vow.

583
01:23:22,407 --> 01:23:26,764
Keeping our word is one of the things
that make us better than you.

584
01:23:28,807 --> 01:23:34,882
A guard will take you to the waiting
room. Your Joyous Time has come.

585
01:23:35,047 --> 01:23:38,642
You are to be prepared
for your wedding.

586
01:23:39,607 --> 01:23:43,520
l'm lost. Nothing can save me now.

587
01:23:58,487 --> 01:24:01,604
Flash Gordon approaching.

588
01:24:01,767 --> 01:24:06,318
What do you mean,
'Flash Gordon approaching'?

589
01:24:06,487 --> 01:24:11,003
<i>on a rocket cycle.</i>
<i>Shall l inform His Majesty?</i>

590
01:24:11,167 --> 01:24:15,638
The Emperor would shoot you
for interrupting his wedding.

591
01:24:15,807 --> 01:24:18,401
Fire when Gordon's in range.

592
01:24:38,727 --> 01:24:44,359
He's escaping, idiot!
Dispatch War Rocket Ajax.

593
01:25:04,687 --> 01:25:07,076
Charge the boosters.

594
01:25:16,767 --> 01:25:21,966
- Flash Gordon in range, Captain.
- Fire!

595
01:25:27,527 --> 01:25:31,918
- Shall we go in after him?
- No. Reduce velocity.

596
01:25:38,807 --> 01:25:43,961
Our trap worked.
They'll follow me for sure.

597
01:25:44,127 --> 01:25:46,800
Stand by, my Hawkmen!

598
01:25:51,127 --> 01:25:55,757
- He's not coming out, sir.
- Prepare to electrify cloud.

599
01:25:56,927 --> 01:26:02,399
Prepare sky nets to catch
Gordon's body. Fire capacitators.

600
01:26:08,167 --> 01:26:12,843
- They're trying to flush you out.
- Let's go in.

601
01:26:19,767 --> 01:26:23,806
Good. They're coming through.

602
01:26:47,087 --> 01:26:51,365
Squadron 40 ... Dive!

603
01:27:07,927 --> 01:27:10,316
Arm topside!

604
01:27:24,007 --> 01:27:26,999
Second wave. Dive!

605
01:27:57,607 --> 01:28:00,167
Stop engines. Repel boarders.

606
01:28:40,207 --> 01:28:45,406
- Biro's hit. l'm going in after him.
- lmpetuous boy.

607
01:28:47,847 --> 01:28:51,965
Oh well, who wants to live forever?

608
01:28:54,087 --> 01:28:56,555
Dive!

609
01:29:50,007 --> 01:29:52,646
Biro, hold on, l'm coming.

610
01:29:54,527 --> 01:29:59,157
- You all right?
- They winged me. Detonate the mine.

611
01:30:03,847 --> 01:30:06,122
Blow it, Flash!

612
01:30:12,047 --> 01:30:15,039
Let's get out of here.

613
01:30:20,967 --> 01:30:24,676
Well done, Flash. Here.
Up there, Luro!

614
01:30:24,847 --> 01:30:27,236
Come on.

615
01:30:32,447 --> 01:30:35,200
Full velocity, all drives.

616
01:30:54,767 --> 01:30:57,645
<i>Attention, all citizens.</i>

617
01:30:57,807 --> 01:31:02,005
<i>Behold the face</i>
<i>of your Empress to be.</i>

618
01:31:04,527 --> 01:31:10,124
While you await the ceremony,
all channels will display -

619
01:31:10,287 --> 01:31:14,405
- the execution of the traitors,
Barin and Zarkov.

620
01:31:27,167 --> 01:31:30,000
Pick that up, would you?

621
01:31:38,367 --> 01:31:40,961
Tell me more about this Houdini.

622
01:31:42,327 --> 01:31:45,399
This is it.
At least it'll be over quickly.

623
01:31:52,847 --> 01:31:57,284
Scanner malfunction,
area <i>7-7</i> delta, under repair.

624
01:32:08,247 --> 01:32:12,081
- They've changed the code.
- l've changed too, Aura.

625
01:32:12,247 --> 01:32:16,035
- l think l can work it out.
- Will you marry me?

626
01:32:16,207 --> 01:32:20,644
We'll try.
Not now, Barin!

627
01:32:20,807 --> 01:32:23,526
lf l'm not at the wedding,
l'll be shot.

628
01:32:23,687 --> 01:32:28,602
l thought it was the Zeitman series!
l haven't changed.

629
01:32:35,167 --> 01:32:40,480
Everybody take off! Form a battle
stream behind the rocket.

630
01:32:40,647 --> 01:32:44,162
Flash and me bail out
when the shooting starts.

631
01:32:44,327 --> 01:32:49,481
- And keep your head down.
- See you in Mingo City.

632
01:32:49,647 --> 01:32:55,358
Yes ... with luck.
What are you setting there?

633
01:32:55,527 --> 01:33:00,362
That's the time left for the Earth.
ln minutes and seconds.

634
01:33:01,687 --> 01:33:06,363
- Level with me. Will this do it?
- Yes, no doubt.

635
01:33:06,527 --> 01:33:10,884
There's a lightning field at the
entrance. When this baby hits it ...

636
01:33:12,327 --> 01:33:18,436
lt will blow that field dead.
My Hawkmen fly right in.

637
01:33:18,607 --> 01:33:21,883
Let's see what Mingo City's saying.

638
01:33:28,407 --> 01:33:29,999
Oh, my God.

639
01:34:00,527 --> 01:34:03,837
- Rocket Ajax returning.
- With Gordon's body?

640
01:34:04,007 --> 01:34:06,999
l presume so. Communications are off.

641
01:34:07,167 --> 01:34:12,958
- Are they in the proper approach?
- <i>Negative.</i>

642
01:34:13,127 --> 01:34:17,120
- Open fire!
<i>- on Ajax?</i>

643
01:34:17,287 --> 01:34:22,122
<i>All weapons, now!</i>
<i>Charge the lightning field.</i>

644
01:34:22,287 --> 01:34:26,838
l take responsibility,
in the Emperor's name.

645
01:34:33,847 --> 01:34:38,284
Attention, all wedding guests.
There is no cause for alarm.

646
01:34:38,447 --> 01:34:42,679
The weapons are being fired
in continuous salute, -

647
01:34:42,847 --> 01:34:46,556
- in honor of His Majesty's wedding.

648
01:34:52,767 --> 01:34:56,840
Come on, Flash.
lt's time to bail out.

649
01:34:57,007 --> 01:35:01,478
Sorry, l'm not coming.
The rocket cycle's gone.

650
01:35:01,647 --> 01:35:05,879
- l'll carry you.
- Bail out, Vultan.

651
01:35:06,047 --> 01:35:09,642
- Are you crazy?
- The fire's too heavy.

652
01:35:09,807 --> 01:35:13,083
We'll never make it
with nobody at the wheel.

653
01:35:13,247 --> 01:35:17,684
- lt's suicide, Flash!
- No. A rational transaction.

654
01:35:17,847 --> 01:35:21,965
- One life for billions.
- You'll be destroyed!

655
01:35:22,127 --> 01:35:25,597
Looney bird!
Get out of here, they need you.

656
01:35:25,767 --> 01:35:31,876
- Goodbye, Flash, it's been ...
- l know. For me too, Vultan.

657
01:35:32,927 --> 01:35:36,397
Tell Dale l know
it would've been good.

658
01:35:36,567 --> 01:35:40,116
You must come from
one hell of a planet.

659
01:35:40,287 --> 01:35:43,359
Not too bad.

660
01:35:53,127 --> 01:35:56,915
Onward, my brave Hawkmen.

661
01:35:57,087 --> 01:36:02,639
Let this be known forever
as Flash Gordon's Day!

662
01:36:05,407 --> 01:36:11,039
- Freeze, you bloody bastards!
- Take us to Ming.

663
01:36:11,207 --> 01:36:14,961
We do not lead traitors
to the Emperor.

664
01:36:15,127 --> 01:36:20,247
We'll find a way.
Grab an imager off an agent.

665
01:36:27,087 --> 01:36:29,601
Zarkov!

666
01:36:33,407 --> 01:36:36,683
- Thank you.
<i>- Ajax still approaching.</i>

667
01:36:36,847 --> 01:36:39,486
<i>ldentified Earthling Gordon</i>
<i>at the controls.</i>

668
01:36:39,647 --> 01:36:44,721
<i>We guarantee its destruction in</i>
<i>the lightning field. General Kala?</i>

669
01:36:44,887 --> 01:36:48,516
<i>Please show yourself.</i>

670
01:36:48,687 --> 01:36:53,124
- Let's go.
- We must deactivate the field.

671
01:36:53,287 --> 01:36:57,644
- Where are the atomic generators?
- There's no time.

672
01:36:57,807 --> 01:37:02,403
l'm heading for Sector Alpha 9.
Hold the fort.

673
01:37:17,047 --> 01:37:21,040
There must be a way of
deactivating the lightning field.

674
01:37:52,887 --> 01:37:56,880
Do you, Ming the Merciless,
ruler of the universe, -

675
01:37:57,047 --> 01:38:01,359
- take this Earthling, Dale Arden,
to be your Empress of the hour?

676
01:38:01,527 --> 01:38:07,443
- Of the hour, yes.
- Do you promise to use her?

677
01:38:07,607 --> 01:38:14,365
Not to blast her into space ...
until you grow weary of her?

678
01:38:14,527 --> 01:38:17,280
- l do.
- l do not!

679
01:38:41,887 --> 01:38:46,642
Recite after me, Your Majesty.
With this ring ...

680
01:38:46,807 --> 01:38:50,686
Matsuna! Ring! Ring!

681
01:38:55,047 --> 01:39:00,326
Recite after me, Your Majesty.
With this ring l thee wed.

682
01:39:02,127 --> 01:39:04,960
Dale, what a damn shame.

683
01:39:10,727 --> 01:39:14,845
Freeze!
Deactivate the lightning field.

684
01:39:37,727 --> 01:39:40,321
- Gordon!
- Flash?

685
01:40:23,767 --> 01:40:29,478
The game's lost. Stop your attack
on Earth, and l'll spare your life.

686
01:40:30,887 --> 01:40:34,197
You pitiful fool.

687
01:40:34,367 --> 01:40:39,157
My life is not
for any Earthling to give, -

688
01:40:39,327 --> 01:40:41,841
- or take.

689
01:40:45,447 --> 01:40:48,359
Your power's fading, Ming.

690
01:41:11,727 --> 01:41:14,958
The reactors are destroyed.
Glad you made it, Vultan.

691
01:41:15,127 --> 01:41:17,960
Better late than never.

692
01:41:18,127 --> 01:41:21,403
- Dale.
- Look out, Flash.

693
01:41:21,567 --> 01:41:25,526
Don't move. Stay where you are.

694
01:41:26,767 --> 01:41:32,319
<i>Long live Flash. You've saved</i>
<i>your Earth. Have a nice day.</i>

695
01:41:41,527 --> 01:41:45,520
Barin is the rightful heir.

696
01:41:45,687 --> 01:41:49,441
Hail Barin, King of Mongo.

697
01:41:49,607 --> 01:41:53,520
We owe everything to Flash.

698
01:41:53,687 --> 01:41:58,158
We appoint Vultan
General of our armies.

699
01:42:00,847 --> 01:42:06,399
From this day on, let every breed
of Mongo live together in peace.

700
01:42:08,727 --> 01:42:13,562
- Will we ever get out of here, Hans?
- l don't know.

701
01:42:13,727 --> 01:42:17,959
- But we'll try.
- We certainly invite you all to stay.

702
01:42:18,127 --> 01:42:22,518
- What do you think?
- l'm a New York City girl.

703
01:42:24,247 --> 01:42:28,240
lt's a little too quiet around here
for me.

704
01:42:39,887 --> 01:42:43,004
THANKS

705
01:42:48,567 --> 01:42:52,879
FLASH

706
