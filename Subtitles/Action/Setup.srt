When I was younger

00:00:58,642 --> 00:01:00,728
I wanted to be a priest.

4
00:01:00,895 --> 00:01:02,521
I was going into battle

5
00:01:02,688 --> 00:01:05,316
to save men's souls
from the evil of the world.

6
00:01:05,483 --> 00:01:07,234
But as I got older,

7
00:01:07,401 --> 00:01:09,737
I saw the world
for what it really was.

8
00:01:09,904 --> 00:01:12,531
It wasn't so much
who I was going to save,

9
00:01:12,698 --> 00:01:15,076
but who was gonna save
the world from me.

48
00:04:02,743 --> 00:04:05,537
Okay, Mr. Antisocial. Next time
you're standing next to some chick

49
00:04:05,704 --> 00:04:07,873
trying to get laid, you're
gonna need my big mouth.

50
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:09,541
Yeah.

51
00:04:09,708 --> 00:04:12,211
The day I need you

My man in the warden's office says
they gonna be putting your ass

59
00:05:09,435 --> 00:05:12,813

Then it's gonna be on, motherfucker.

Fuck you, nigger.
Anytime.

00:05:16,025 --> 00:05:18,569
You's a real tough
motherfucker now, huh?

62
00:05:18,736 --> 00:05:21,363
That's why they got your ass

69
00:05:44,303 --> 00:05:46,096
You want to run

70
00:05:46,263 --> 00:05:49,099
Come on, I can't hear you.
Come on, motherfucker.

71
00:05:49,266 --> 00:05:51,352
Run your mouth.
I'll fuck you anytime, man.

72
00:05:51,518 --> 00:05:53,395
- Any fucking time.
- Guard: Shut up!

73
00:05:53,562 --> 00:05:55,481
Keep your mouth shut.
Keep your mouth shut.

74
00:05:55,647 --> 00:05:57,608
Hey, general population,
I'll see you there.

75
00:05:59,234 --> 00:06:01,320
Hey, you gonna nurse that bottle
or are you gonna drink it?

76
00:06:01,487 --> 00:06:02,988
What, you in a hurry, man?

77
00:06:03,155 --> 00:06:05,366
Pass that shit.
I need to warm up.

78
00:06:08,952 --> 00:06:11,830
I was just remembering
the first time

79
00:06:11,997 --> 00:06:13,832
Dave ever met my pop.

80
00:06:13,999 --> 00:06:16,210
Dude, I thought he was
gonna shit himself.

81
00:06:16,377 --> 00:06:17,795
You remember that?
You were stuttering.

82
00:06:17,961 --> 00:06:20,422
You were like, "N-n-n-nice
to meet you, s-sir."

83
00:06:20,589 --> 00:06:22,174
Fuck you.
Whatever, man.

84
00:06:22,341 --> 00:06:24,802
I don't blame you for being scared, man.
I've been scared of him too.

85
00:06:24,968 --> 00:06:26,887
Could be a mean old
son of a bitch.

86
00:06:27,054 --> 00:06:29,056
Nah, he was just all talk.

87
00:06:29,223 --> 00:06:31,892
All talk? That's all you've been
doing is talking.

88
00:06:32,059 --> 00:06:33,560
Start drinking.

89
00:06:38,399 --> 00:06:42,069
- Man, it is cold up here.
- Dave: Fucking freezing.

90
00:06:42,236 --> 00:06:44,238
Dave:
Hey, man, hey.

91
00:06:44,405 --> 00:06:47,241
You know why I love
being up here, man?

92
00:06:47,408 --> 00:06:50,160
It's just like
being above it all, man.

93
00:06:50,327 --> 00:06:53,497
Like no problems pressing
down on my shoulders.

94
00:06:53,664 --> 00:06:55,582
Hey, like if you need counseling,
I've got you covered.

95
00:06:55,749 --> 00:06:57,918
- But can I have the bottle?
- Yeah, right.

96
00:07:01,130 --> 00:07:03,132
Man, fuck

97
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:08,679

98
00:07:08,846 --> 00:07:11,890
Come on, bro, relax.

99
00:07:12,057 --> 00:07:14,852
Come on, hug it out.

- Where's your guy?
- He'll be here.

152
00:10:30,756 --> 00:10:32,966
You tell him we'd be down
here by the old truck depot?

153
00:10:33,133 --> 00:10:34,635
Yeah, I told him.

154
00:10:34,801 --> 00:10:38,388
- You say down by the river?
- The river, yeah.

155

See, now you see why i did
what i did, man. I got y'alls back.

Here he comes.

162
00:11:28,105 --> 00:11:30,023
Why don't y'all wait here?

163

Dave:
$5 million, man.

164
00:11:35,112 --> 00:11:37,280
I can take care of my girl.

Sonny: That's all you think about.
Valerie this, Valerie that.

166
00:11:40,409 --> 00:11:42,869
- Dave: What do you want?
- I'm waiting on that money.

167
00:11:43,036 --> 00:11:45,622
- You okay?
- Yeah.

168
00:11:49,793 --> 00:11:52,587
You sure?

169
00:11:52,754 --> 00:11:55,006
Like I got a choice.

170
00:11:57,801 --> 00:11:59,845
- ( gunshot)
- Oh!

171
00:12:00,011 --> 00:12:02,556
- What the fuck are you doing?
- I'm sorry, bro.

172
00:12:02,723 --> 00:12:05,475
( gunshot )

173
00:12:06,893 --> 00:12:08,729
Let's go!
Let's go!

174
00:12:15,235 --> 00:12:17,571
Sonny's voice:
As I laid gasping for my next breath,

175
00:12:17,738 --> 00:12:20,157
I knew God had given me
a second chance.

176
00:12:20,323 --> 00:12:22,743
But I was too stupid
to take it.

177
00:12:22,909 --> 00:12:24,745
I was going to get
what was mine.

178
00:12:24,911 --> 00:12:26,288
( groans )

179
00:12:26,455 --> 00:12:28,123
Sonny, what the fuck?

180
00:12:28,290 --> 00:12:29,332
- Fuck!
- He shot me.

181
00:12:29,499 --> 00:12:31,293
- Who shot you?
- Vince, man.

182
00:12:32,586 --> 00:12:35,213
Are you fucking kidding me?
Sit down.

183
00:12:36,590 --> 00:12:39,217
- Where'd you get hit?
- Up top.

184
00:12:39,384 --> 00:12:41,470
Lay down.
Lay down.

185
00:12:42,763 --> 00:12:44,097
Oh fuck.

186
00:12:44,264 --> 00:12:46,224
It's lodged
in your collarbone.

187
00:12:50,604 --> 00:12:52,522
Get your fucking dirty hands
out of there. Let me have a look.

188
00:12:52,689 --> 00:12:56,026
You got lucky. Looks like
it hit your cross. Let me get this off.

189
00:12:56,193 --> 00:12:59,488
- My mom gave me that.
- Yeah, I know.

190
00:12:59,654 --> 00:13:01,990
Hold on, you're gonna
need this. Here.

191
00:13:02,157 --> 00:13:05,118
'Cause this is gonna
pucker your asshole.

192
00:13:08,330 --> 00:13:10,916
Move this.
Ready?

193
00:13:12,375 --> 00:13:15,045
Oh shit.

194
00:13:15,212 --> 00:13:16,963
It ain't even that deep.

195
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:18,715
It's fucking burning, man.

196
00:13:20,217 --> 00:13:21,968
I heard something
was gonna go down.

197
00:13:22,135 --> 00:13:23,553
I didn't think
it was you guys.

198
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:25,013
What did you hear, Joe?

199
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:27,891
Come on, let me finish
this shit, all right?

200
00:13:28,058 --> 00:13:30,769
Ahh! Shit!

201
00:13:30,936 --> 00:13:32,437
Fuck, it's in there.
Hold on.

202
00:13:32,604 --> 00:13:35,690
I see the shit.
I feel it.

203
00:13:35,857 --> 00:13:37,776
(groaning )

204
00:13:37,943 --> 00:13:39,945
Oh Shit. Shit.

205
00:13:40,111 --> 00:13:41,655
Hold on, hold on.

206
00:13:41,822 --> 00:13:43,824
Oh fuck.

207
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:47,786
Nice, huh? I'll make
a nice tongue stud with that.

208
00:13:53,041 --> 00:13:56,044
I can't believe he shot me, man.
What'd you hear, Joey?

209
00:13:56,211 --> 00:13:58,296
Vince was running his mouth

210
00:13:58,463 --> 00:14:01,132
to some connected guys downtown
that he's got a big score coming.

211
00:14:01,299 --> 00:14:03,301
Why would he say that?
We never kick back to them.

212
00:14:03,468 --> 00:14:06,304
I don't know. I think he was just
trying to buy some protection.

213
00:14:09,766 --> 00:14:11,768
Hold that there. Hold that.

214
00:14:19,025 --> 00:14:21,194
Where the fuck are you going?
You need to lay down.

215
00:14:21,361 --> 00:14:23,029
- I got to find him.
- Oh, yeah, genius?

216
00:14:23,196 --> 00:14:25,740
You gonna be walking around in
a bloody shirt with a bullet hole in it?

217
00:14:25,907 --> 00:14:28,034
Cops won't be looking for that.
Take that shit off.

218
00:14:28,201 --> 00:14:30,203
Here.

219
00:14:32,205 --> 00:14:36,710
- Listen, you know John R, right?
- Yeah, made guy, runs the card clubs.

220
00:14:36,877 --> 00:14:38,920
Yeah, down on Woodward.
Now I'll bet

221
00:14:39,087 --> 00:14:41,339
if someone was to go
down there this Friday night,

222
00:14:41,506 --> 00:14:45,594
he might run into Vince or someone
who knows where he is.

223
00:14:47,053 --> 00:14:49,931
- Thanks, Joey.
- Hey, hold on.

224
00:14:51,892 --> 00:14:53,810
Try not to get
your ass shot again, all right?

225
00:14:56,021 --> 00:14:57,564
You need anything,
you come back here.

226
00:14:57,731 --> 00:15:00,025
- All right?
- All right.

227
00:15:00,191 --> 00:15:02,736
(church bells ringing )

228
00:15:29,930 --> 00:15:32,599
Do you want to talk about it?

229
00:15:32,766 --> 00:15:34,935
Talk about what?

230
00:15:35,101 --> 00:15:37,103
Whatever brought you here.

231
00:15:39,189 --> 00:15:41,358
I'm here to pray for a friend.

232
00:15:41,524 --> 00:15:42,776
Ah.

233
00:15:42,943 --> 00:15:44,819
Is he sick?

234
00:15:44,986 --> 00:15:47,906
No. He's dead.

235
00:15:49,574 --> 00:15:51,451
Forgive me for asking.

236
00:15:51,618 --> 00:15:53,870
Were you close?

237
00:15:54,037 --> 00:15:55,789
Yeah.

238
00:15:55,956 --> 00:15:57,958
We were like brothers.

239
00:15:58,124 --> 00:16:02,504
Then rest assured
he is in a better place now.

240
00:16:03,755 --> 00:16:07,050
How do you know?
You ever been dead before?

241
00:16:11,805 --> 00:16:14,891
There are many paths
to God, my son.

242
00:16:15,058 --> 00:16:18,520
I pray that yours
will not be too difficult.

243
00:16:33,284 --> 00:16:35,495
- There you are.
- Thank you, sir.

244
00:16:49,009 --> 00:16:51,177
Hey, beautiful lines.

245
00:16:51,344 --> 00:16:53,096
Yeah.

246
00:16:53,263 --> 00:16:56,558
I guess $5 million will buy you
a lot of things like that, huh?

247
00:16:58,727 --> 00:17:01,938
You see, my friend, I think we are
both looking for the same thing.

248
00:17:02,105 --> 00:17:04,607
I'm not your friend
and I'm not looking for anything.

249
00:17:04,774 --> 00:17:08,820
Okay, so let's cut
the bullshit, shall we?

250
00:17:08,987 --> 00:17:12,699
You took something from us
and we want it back.

251
00:17:12,866 --> 00:17:16,286
And I'm the guy
they picked to get it back.

252
00:17:16,453 --> 00:17:20,749
However, if you help us,

253
00:17:20,915 --> 00:17:23,585
we are willing to overlook
your part in it.

254
00:17:23,752 --> 00:17:26,880
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

255
00:17:27,047 --> 00:17:30,383
Hey, come on. It only took me
two days to find you.

256
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:33,762
And if I get those stones
without your help,

257
00:17:33,928 --> 00:17:36,848
we are going to meet again.

258
00:17:37,015 --> 00:17:41,227
Except this time you won't
even hear the hammer drop.

259
00:17:41,394 --> 00:17:43,938
Are we clear?

260
00:17:44,105 --> 00:17:46,524
Look, if it was up to my friends

261
00:17:46,691 --> 00:17:48,276
you'd be dead already.

262
00:17:48,443 --> 00:17:51,905
But I'm a patient man.

263
00:17:53,656 --> 00:17:56,910
You've got one week, huh?

264
00:17:57,077 --> 00:17:59,954
It was very nice meeting you.

265
00:18:02,749 --> 00:18:04,959
Oh, hey, ladies.
How's it going?

266
00:18:05,126 --> 00:18:07,378
What you guys up to tonight?

267
00:18:07,545 --> 00:18:10,590
Oh come on,
don't be like that.

268
00:18:10,757 --> 00:18:12,634
Could you get that door
for me, big man?

269
00:18:12,801 --> 00:18:14,427
Sure, no problem.

270
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:20,683
Why don't you stop playing
like such a fucking nit?

271
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:23,978
- I'm out.
- Shut your trap, you fuck stick.

272
00:18:24,145 --> 00:18:25,772
In fact, take that.

273
00:18:27,774 --> 00:18:29,275
Put your hands
where I can see 'em.

274
00:18:29,442 --> 00:18:32,779
- Are you robbing us?
- Let's not get ahead of ourselves.

275
00:18:32,946 --> 00:18:34,948
Who the fuck do you think
you're talking to?

276
00:18:35,115 --> 00:18:36,491
(grunts)

277
00:18:36,658 --> 00:18:38,284
All right, now let's start over.

278
00:18:38,451 --> 00:18:41,037
Okay, what can we do for you?

279
00:18:41,204 --> 00:18:43,623
Now we're getting somewhere.
I'm looking for Vincent Long.

280
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:45,667
- Anybody seen him?
- No.

281
00:18:45,834 --> 00:18:47,210
Of course
everyone's got amnesia.

282
00:18:47,377 --> 00:18:49,003
But if you get
your memory back,

283
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:51,381
tell him an old friend is
looking for him, all right?

284
00:18:54,509 --> 00:18:56,427
And now I'm robbing you.

285
00:18:56,594 --> 00:18:58,847
- What the fuck are you looking at?
- Nothing.

286
00:19:16,447 --> 00:19:18,408
- How's everything over here?
- Very good.

287
00:19:18,575 --> 00:19:20,368
Okay? Good.

288
00:19:20,535 --> 00:19:23,163
- All done?
- Yeah, I'm finished.

289
00:19:23,329 --> 00:19:26,082
- I just need the check, please.
- Okay.

290
00:19:31,129 --> 00:19:34,549
Here you go.

291
00:19:34,716 --> 00:19:36,968
Slow night tonight, huh?

292
00:19:37,135 --> 00:19:39,679
Yeah well, it pays the bills.

293
00:19:39,846 --> 00:19:42,640
I'm really a singer. I'm not
gonna be here much longer.

294
00:19:42,807 --> 00:19:44,684
And why is that?

295
00:19:44,851 --> 00:19:46,561
Well, I pray every night

296
00:19:46,728 --> 00:19:48,438
that God gets me
a record contract.

297
00:19:48,605 --> 00:19:51,024
- Does He hear you?
- Of course He does.

298
00:19:52,192 --> 00:19:53,902
I just have to wait my turn.

299
00:19:55,904 --> 00:19:57,822
No no, that's for you.

300
00:19:57,989 --> 00:20:00,867
Thank you.

301
00:20:01,034 --> 00:20:02,869
Good things are coming
to you too.

302
00:20:03,036 --> 00:20:04,579
- I promise.
-( laughs )

303
00:20:04,746 --> 00:20:06,456
Happy holidays.

304
00:20:13,087 --> 00:20:15,131
(grunts)

305
00:20:23,056 --> 00:20:24,349
You with me?

306
00:20:24,515 --> 00:20:27,727
- You got a name?
- Sonny.

307
00:20:27,894 --> 00:20:30,563
Like in "O what a sunny
fucking day we're having?"

308
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:32,315
Fuck you.
Who are you?

309
00:20:32,482 --> 00:20:34,817
All right, Sonny.
Sleepy-time.

310
00:20:41,199 --> 00:20:43,660
Are you out
of your fucking mind?

311
00:20:43,826 --> 00:20:46,037
Are you?

312
00:20:47,872 --> 00:20:50,416
I'm looking for my so-called friend.
He shot me.

313
00:20:50,583 --> 00:20:53,753
- I'm gonna find him.
- So you can shoot him?

314
00:20:57,257 --> 00:20:59,884
Are you retarded?
Are you handicapped?

315
00:21:00,051 --> 00:21:02,679
You think you're gonna
come into my town

316
00:21:02,845 --> 00:21:05,181
and take down poker games,

317
00:21:05,348 --> 00:21:07,809
shoot whoever you want
without my permission?

318
00:21:07,976 --> 00:21:10,144
Are you done
with your speech?

319
00:21:13,314 --> 00:21:15,316
Take it easy, Petey.

320
00:21:19,779 --> 00:21:22,115
What's the name
of the kid that shot you?

321
00:21:22,282 --> 00:21:25,868
Vincent. Vincent Long.

322
00:21:27,870 --> 00:21:30,123
Vincent Long that runs
with John R's crew?

323
00:21:30,290 --> 00:21:32,125
Yeah, he's been hanging around.

324
00:21:33,418 --> 00:21:35,003
Congratulations.

325
00:21:35,169 --> 00:21:37,672
You managed to piss off
a very important group of people

326
00:21:37,839 --> 00:21:40,758
that I make money with.
That means you owe me now.

327
00:21:40,925 --> 00:21:43,511
- Is that right?
- Yeah, that's right.

328
00:21:43,678 --> 00:21:46,097
Every fucking thing
I say is right.

329
00:21:49,392 --> 00:21:51,144
But I'm a fair guy.

330
00:21:51,311 --> 00:21:53,396
You help me out with my problem

331
00:21:53,563 --> 00:21:55,398
and I can help you out
with your problem.

332
00:21:55,565 --> 00:21:57,275
I'm listening.

333
00:21:57,442 --> 00:22:01,237
I used to know a guy,
laundered money for the Russians.

334
00:22:03,323 --> 00:22:06,367
But he had a funny way
of counting.

335
00:22:06,534 --> 00:22:09,537
For every $3 he laundered
he kept $1 for himself.

336
00:22:09,704 --> 00:22:12,957
Accumulated quite
a stack of dollars.

337
00:22:13,124 --> 00:22:15,084
$2 million.

338
00:22:15,251 --> 00:22:17,712
Only problem is the Russians
found out about it

339
00:22:17,879 --> 00:22:20,256
and chopped both his legs
off with a axe.

340
00:22:20,423 --> 00:22:22,425
But they never found the money.

341
00:22:22,592 --> 00:22:24,635
His family buried it with him.

342
00:22:24,802 --> 00:22:27,513
Well, I ain't digging up
no motherfucking dead body.

343
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:30,433
Shut the fuck up.

344
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:33,186
I don't want you to dig
anyone up.

345
00:22:35,021 --> 00:22:36,647
The Russians found out
where the money is.

346
00:22:36,814 --> 00:22:39,067
They're gonna take it
out of the ground tonight

347
00:22:39,233 --> 00:22:40,777
and you're gonna take it
from them.

348
00:22:40,943 --> 00:22:42,111
What's in it for me?

349
00:22:42,278 --> 00:22:46,240
Very few men know the exact
value of their life.

350
00:22:46,407 --> 00:22:48,576
Now you know
what yours is worth.

351
00:22:48,743 --> 00:22:50,870
$2 million.

352
00:22:51,037 --> 00:22:53,456
And just to make sure
you bring that money to me,

353
00:22:53,623 --> 00:22:55,500
I'm gonna send Petey
along with you.

354
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:00,838
Get out of here.

355
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:09,222
Okay, there they are.

356
00:23:14,519 --> 00:23:16,771
Kick back, relax.
We'll let them dig it up.

357
00:23:16,938 --> 00:23:19,524
( exhales )

358
00:23:19,690 --> 00:23:21,776
Hey, you got a plan?

359
00:23:21,943 --> 00:23:24,529
A plan? Oh yeah,
the plan's real complicated.

360
00:23:24,695 --> 00:23:26,406
You're gonna sneak
your ass down there

361
00:23:26,572 --> 00:23:28,991
and shoot those motherfuckers
in the head and grab the money.

362
00:23:29,158 --> 00:23:31,536
Then you're gonna run your ass
back up here like a crack nigger

363
00:23:31,702 --> 00:23:33,788
at a police funeral.
You down with that, homie?

364
00:23:33,955 --> 00:23:35,248
And where you gonna be at?

365
00:23:35,415 --> 00:23:37,834
Oh, close enough to shoot you
in the head if you fuck up.

366
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,420
What's to stop you from shooting me
after I bring you the money?

367
00:23:40,586 --> 00:23:43,423
That's what we call
a calculated risk.

368
00:23:43,589 --> 00:23:45,466
Ssst

369
00:23:47,510 --> 00:23:48,886
Petey:
All right, they got it.

370
00:23:49,053 --> 00:23:51,514
- Let's go. Go get it.
- Shit.

371
00:24:10,366 --> 00:24:11,784
(grunts)

372
00:24:21,377 --> 00:24:22,503
Get down.

373
00:24:27,425 --> 00:24:30,845
(mumbling quietly)

374
00:24:50,156 --> 00:24:51,991
Got it.

375
00:24:54,327 --> 00:24:56,537
I get your $2 million
and you're still gonna shoot me?

376
00:24:56,704 --> 00:24:58,456
No.

377
00:24:58,623 --> 00:25:02,168
But I can't watch you
and drive this car at the same time.

378
00:25:02,335 --> 00:25:03,544
I need that other gun.

379
00:25:08,508 --> 00:25:10,384
Thanks, Sonny.
You're all right.

380
00:25:10,551 --> 00:25:12,678
You've got some balls.

381
00:25:12,845 --> 00:25:16,390
You don't have to worry
about your problem now.

382
00:25:16,557 --> 00:25:18,351
Mr. Biggs is a man of his word.

383
00:25:18,518 --> 00:25:20,520
I know you two got off
on the wrong foot.

384
00:25:20,686 --> 00:25:24,398
Hey, you did the job,
we've got his cash.

385
00:25:24,565 --> 00:25:26,317
Shit, let's celebrate.

386
00:25:26,484 --> 00:25:28,152
Know anyplace
where we can get a bag?

387
00:25:28,319 --> 00:25:31,948
I know a few people.
Let me make some phone calls.

388
00:25:32,990 --> 00:25:34,992
Make it happen.

389
00:25:43,709 --> 00:25:45,836
Hey, what's up? It's Sonny.

390
00:25:46,003 --> 00:25:48,047
Yeah yeah yeah, I know.

391
00:25:48,214 --> 00:25:51,551
Hey, I want to stop by there.
You know, got to get a little something.

392
00:25:53,010 --> 00:25:55,680
All right. All right, cool.

393
00:26:11,946 --> 00:26:14,115
You're just gonna leave
the money in the trunk?

394
00:26:14,282 --> 00:26:15,741
Yeah, why not?

395
00:26:15,908 --> 00:26:18,119
Who the fuck's gonna know
I got $2 million in my car?

396
00:26:23,374 --> 00:26:25,251
( knocks )

397
00:26:28,087 --> 00:26:29,422
( knocks )

398
00:26:29,589 --> 00:26:32,633
- ( gunshots on game )
-( knocking )

399
00:26:41,058 --> 00:26:42,518
About time
you showed up, man.

400
00:26:42,685 --> 00:26:44,186
Come on, man.

401
00:26:44,353 --> 00:26:45,563
Who this?

402
00:26:45,730 --> 00:26:47,607
G, Petey; Petey, G.

403
00:26:47,773 --> 00:26:49,191
Is he a cop?

404
00:26:49,358 --> 00:26:51,569
Come on, why you gonna
ask me some shit like that?

405
00:26:51,736 --> 00:26:53,446
Shit, nigga, I had to ask.

406
00:26:53,613 --> 00:26:55,781
Y'all come on in.

407
00:26:58,576 --> 00:27:00,369
Damn.

408
00:27:04,206 --> 00:27:06,250
Hey man, the war is over.
Didn't you hear?

409
00:27:06,417 --> 00:27:08,544
Depends on which war
you're talking about.

410
00:27:08,711 --> 00:27:10,838
How much you need?

411
00:27:19,096 --> 00:27:21,849
Oh yeah.
I can handle that.

412
00:27:26,562 --> 00:27:28,606
G Money:
So how you been, Sonny?

413
00:27:28,773 --> 00:27:31,484
Sonny:
Hey, surviving.

414
00:27:31,651 --> 00:27:33,653
What's up
with this motherfucker, man?

415
00:27:33,819 --> 00:27:37,448
- That's business.
- Yeah, I can dig it.

416
00:27:44,205 --> 00:27:46,040
( laughs )

417
00:27:46,207 --> 00:27:48,000
I can smell that weed
from over here, man.

418
00:27:48,167 --> 00:27:49,710
Ooh, this is that fire.

419
00:27:49,877 --> 00:27:51,837
Now we call this
that snake weed.

420
00:27:52,004 --> 00:27:54,548
Got a partner, man,
he runs an exotic pet store--

421
00:27:57,134 --> 00:27:58,928
Hey, motherfucker.
What are you doing?

422
00:27:59,095 --> 00:28:00,513
This ain't goddamn
"Duck Hunt."

423
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:02,932
Relax. I can handle
a fucking gun.

424
00:28:03,099 --> 00:28:04,517
I'm quite sure
you can handle a gun.

425
00:28:04,684 --> 00:28:06,811
But I just spent $2,000
getting them triggers dialed up.

426
00:28:09,689 --> 00:28:11,190
He's your boy, huh?

427
00:28:22,368 --> 00:28:26,747
Anyway, man, he puts the weed
inside of boa constrictors.

428
00:28:26,914 --> 00:28:29,500
- And customs don't check it?
- There ain't nobody dumb enough

429
00:28:29,667 --> 00:28:31,293
to put their hand down
no goddamn snake's throat.

430
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:34,213
( laughs )
They're too cheap for the X-rays.

431
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:36,549
So they just wave them
motherfuckers on through.

432
00:28:36,716 --> 00:28:38,843
- ( gunshot )
- Holy shit!

433
00:28:39,009 --> 00:28:41,721
- Oh shit.
- This is bad, man.

434
00:28:41,887 --> 00:28:43,389
- Get a towel.
- What?

435
00:28:43,556 --> 00:28:44,724
- Get a towel.
- Why, man?

436
00:28:44,890 --> 00:28:46,308
This motherfucker's dead.

437
00:28:46,475 --> 00:28:49,103
- The fucking guns is loaded?
- Man, do you keep a car in the garage

438
00:28:49,270 --> 00:28:51,605
without no gas in it?
You heard me, right?

439
00:28:51,772 --> 00:28:53,983
I told this motherfucker.
I said do not touch the guns.

440
00:28:54,150 --> 00:28:56,736
But he wanted to be the goddamn
Lone Ranger and start fucking with shit.

441
00:28:56,902 --> 00:28:58,070
I am not going down
for this shit.

442
00:28:58,237 --> 00:28:59,405
Get me something
to wrap him up in.

443
00:28:59,572 --> 00:29:01,323
I got two strikes.
This ain't gonna be my third.

444
00:29:01,490 --> 00:29:04,118
- Get me something to wrap him up in.
- Shit, where are we gonna take him?

445
00:29:04,285 --> 00:29:05,578
- I know a guy.
- Is he far?

446
00:29:05,745 --> 00:29:07,204
Motherfucker, you got
something better to do?

447
00:29:07,371 --> 00:29:09,081
No no no. You're right.

448
00:29:10,666 --> 00:29:12,918
- Shit.
- Okay.

449
00:29:13,085 --> 00:29:15,254
Okay. Man, you ought
to ashamed of yourself

450
00:29:15,421 --> 00:29:17,506
bringing this crazy white man
to my motherfucking house.

451
00:29:17,673 --> 00:29:20,301
- You know that?
- Help me turn him over.

452
00:29:20,468 --> 00:29:22,219
- Oh shit.
- Oh shit.

453
00:29:22,386 --> 00:29:24,263
- All right.
- Help me pick him up.

454
00:29:24,430 --> 00:29:26,098
I ain't fucking with you
no more, Sonny.

455
00:29:26,265 --> 00:29:29,643
I am not fucking with you no more.
One, two, three.

456
00:29:29,810 --> 00:29:31,103
( both groan )

457
00:29:32,605 --> 00:29:34,231
- Oh.
- Oh shit.

458
00:29:34,398 --> 00:29:35,941
Damn.

459
00:29:36,108 --> 00:29:38,486
All right, all right.
Hold on. All right.

460
00:29:41,113 --> 00:29:43,365
What the hell were you
feeding this man?

461
00:29:49,455 --> 00:29:51,040
Right, where are the keys?

462
00:29:51,207 --> 00:29:52,708
He's got the keys.

463
00:29:52,875 --> 00:29:55,127
He got the keys?

464
00:29:56,712 --> 00:29:58,422
Well, you get 'em.
I ain't touching him.

465
00:30:06,263 --> 00:30:07,973
Getting my gun.

466
00:30:09,308 --> 00:30:11,727
Don't shoot your dick off,
motherfucker.

467
00:30:23,489 --> 00:30:25,866
Okay.

468
00:30:31,831 --> 00:30:34,625
G Money: You know I got
some nosy-ass neighbors.

469
00:30:38,254 --> 00:30:40,172
All right.

470
00:30:42,925 --> 00:30:44,134
Hey, Sonny man.

471
00:30:44,301 --> 00:30:46,178
Look, bro, you're my boy.
All right?

472
00:30:46,345 --> 00:30:49,849
Love you, man. But don't come
around here no more, all right?

473
00:30:50,015 --> 00:30:52,309
Bad for business, man.

474
00:31:13,664 --> 00:31:15,958
Hey, you're early.

475
00:31:16,125 --> 00:31:17,710
The suits are still here.

476
00:31:17,877 --> 00:31:19,753
- Come around the side in a mo.
- Okay.

477
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:22,256
All right?

478
00:31:22,423 --> 00:31:25,509
Grab his legs.

479
00:31:25,676 --> 00:31:27,803
Help me get him undressed.

480
00:31:27,970 --> 00:31:29,597
He's a big boy, isn't he?

481
00:31:34,310 --> 00:31:35,811
What are we gonna
do with his clothes?

482
00:31:35,978 --> 00:31:37,688
Oh, there's a furnace
in the back.

483
00:31:47,823 --> 00:31:49,909
( fabric ripping )

484
00:31:50,910 --> 00:31:52,745
Hmm.

485
00:31:52,912 --> 00:31:55,122
All right.

486
00:31:57,833 --> 00:31:59,585
All right.

487
00:32:07,718 --> 00:32:10,471
( sawing )

488
00:32:10,638 --> 00:32:13,724
( breathing heavily )

489
00:32:13,891 --> 00:32:16,226
(giggling )

490
00:32:27,029 --> 00:32:29,406
Yeah, bring the bin
a bit closer.

491
00:32:32,952 --> 00:32:34,787
There we go.

492
00:32:40,125 --> 00:32:43,045
Right.

493
00:32:43,212 --> 00:32:45,756
Did you know there's 207 bones
in the human body?

494
00:32:45,923 --> 00:32:49,385
And 27 of those are in the cranium.

495
00:32:49,551 --> 00:32:52,596
Now the average cranial capacity

496
00:32:52,763 --> 00:32:55,015
of modern man-- hit it, would you?

497
00:32:55,182 --> 00:32:57,476
--is 1200cc.

498
00:32:57,643 --> 00:33:00,479
And the average cranial capacity

499
00:33:00,646 --> 00:33:02,106
of Neanderthal man

500
00:33:02,272 --> 00:33:04,274
is 1800cc.

501
00:33:04,441 --> 00:33:06,652
I was just thinking
how fascinating

502
00:33:06,819 --> 00:33:09,863
that a creature that we think
is a primitive caveman

503
00:33:10,030 --> 00:33:13,242
actually had 27% more brains

504
00:33:13,409 --> 00:33:15,995
than anyone alive today.

505
00:33:16,161 --> 00:33:18,664
Sonny's voice: As I listened
to the butcher rambling on

506
00:33:18,831 --> 00:33:21,500
it hit me--
Vince set up the score.

507
00:33:21,667 --> 00:33:23,544
So the driver must have
been in on it.

508
00:33:23,711 --> 00:33:26,839
If I found her,
I'd be that much closer to him.

509
00:33:27,006 --> 00:33:28,882
As for Petey, well...

510
00:33:29,049 --> 00:33:32,594
let's just say there's a reason
I'll never eat a hamburger again.

511
00:34:13,719 --> 00:34:15,554
( car starts )

512
00:34:43,499 --> 00:34:45,000
Drive around the block.

513
00:34:45,167 --> 00:34:47,795
( gasps )
Okay.

514
00:34:47,961 --> 00:34:50,672
Okay. Okay, please.

515
00:34:50,839 --> 00:34:53,133
( whimpers )

516
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:55,677
Please take it easy.

517
00:34:57,429 --> 00:34:59,223
This is far enough.
Pull over.

518
00:35:00,349 --> 00:35:02,601
Please don't hurt me.

519
00:35:02,768 --> 00:35:05,104
Shut it off.

520
00:35:06,605 --> 00:35:08,690
- Okay.
- What's your name?

521
00:35:08,857 --> 00:35:11,527
Mia.

522
00:35:11,693 --> 00:35:13,570
You recognize me?

523
00:35:15,405 --> 00:35:18,367
No, I'm sorry.
I don't. Should I?

524
00:35:18,534 --> 00:35:21,703
An Iranian diamond broker got jacked
on the corner of 6th and Santa Fe.

525
00:35:21,870 --> 00:35:24,373
( breathes heavily )

526
00:35:25,916 --> 00:35:27,292
Yeah, that's right.

527
00:35:27,459 --> 00:35:29,086
I didn't get my share.
Where is he?

528
00:35:29,253 --> 00:35:32,965
The blonde guy? I swear
I have not seen him since then.

529
00:35:33,132 --> 00:35:35,259
L-- I met him
through some friends.

530
00:35:35,425 --> 00:35:38,637
He offered me $5,000
to take this guy to a spot.

531
00:35:38,804 --> 00:35:40,305
- Bullshit.
- No no no no.

532
00:35:40,472 --> 00:35:42,015
I swear to God.
(crying )

533
00:35:42,182 --> 00:35:44,643
I'm telling you the truth.
You have to believe me.

534
00:35:44,810 --> 00:35:47,271
I did not know that my client
was gonna get hurt.

535
00:35:47,437 --> 00:35:50,190
He promised me that
that wasn't going to happen.

536
00:35:50,357 --> 00:35:53,485
I swear to God I'm telling you
the truth. You have to believe me.

537
00:35:53,652 --> 00:35:55,821
Please, believe me.

538
00:35:55,988 --> 00:35:58,240
- Mia.
- Yes?

539
00:35:58,407 --> 00:36:01,535
For your sake I hope
you're telling the truth.

540
00:36:08,750 --> 00:36:10,794
Oh God.

541
00:37:30,123 --> 00:37:32,334
Gotcha.

542
00:38:33,312 --> 00:38:35,105
Whoa whoa whoa
whoa whoa.

543
00:38:35,272 --> 00:38:37,316
There's no money
in the house.

544
00:38:37,482 --> 00:38:38,817
Vincent Long, you know him?

545
00:38:38,984 --> 00:38:41,653
No, I've never heard of him.

546
00:38:44,614 --> 00:38:46,700
Okay, yeah, I know him.

547
00:38:46,867 --> 00:38:49,202
Sit your ass down.

548
00:38:55,542 --> 00:38:57,002
Let's start with who you are.

549
00:38:57,169 --> 00:38:59,463
I'm Russell.

550
00:38:59,629 --> 00:39:02,799
I work for
the diamond exchange.

551
00:39:02,966 --> 00:39:06,511
Your friend came to me, asked me if
I could move $5 million in uncut stones.

552
00:39:06,678 --> 00:39:08,430
He brought 'em, I paid him.

553
00:39:08,597 --> 00:39:10,390
Done deal.
Everybody got their share.

554
00:39:10,557 --> 00:39:11,892
Not everybody.

555
00:39:12,059 --> 00:39:14,394
Well, obviously.

556
00:39:14,561 --> 00:39:17,147
- What's the girl's angle?
- Mia?

557
00:39:17,314 --> 00:39:18,857
She's my girlfriend.

558
00:39:19,024 --> 00:39:21,234
We needed a driver
who wouldn't freak out.

559
00:39:21,401 --> 00:39:23,945
So we planted her
at the car service.

560
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:27,616
Look, I can't help you.

561
00:39:27,783 --> 00:39:30,827
I move diamonds.
That's all I do.

562
00:39:30,994 --> 00:39:32,996
People don't get their share,
some guy gets clipped,

563
00:39:33,163 --> 00:39:35,082
it's not my fucking problem.
Hey, whoa, hey!

564
00:39:35,248 --> 00:39:37,334
- Dave Hall.
- What?

565
00:39:37,501 --> 00:39:40,837
Say it, Dave Hall.
Say it, God damn it.

566
00:39:41,004 --> 00:39:42,756
- Dave Hall.
- Dave Hall! Dave Hall.

567
00:39:42,923 --> 00:39:44,633
That wasn't just
anybody who got clipped.

568
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:47,302
That was my long-time
friend Dave Hall.

569
00:39:48,929 --> 00:39:51,640
Hey hey, I can help you
get Vince.

570
00:39:51,807 --> 00:39:54,184
- Yeah?
- Yeah, it won't be easy.

571
00:39:54,351 --> 00:39:57,229
He's got a place
he hangs out over on 3rd.

572
00:39:57,396 --> 00:40:00,941
Couple of guys, tough--
real stone killers.

573
00:40:03,402 --> 00:40:05,529
Now when you see him
you to give him a message.

574
00:40:05,695 --> 00:40:08,490
Tell him his old friend from high school
is looking for him.

575
00:40:16,873 --> 00:40:19,292
Oh, you're kidding me.
You're kidding me, right?

576
00:40:19,459 --> 00:40:21,420
Really?

577
00:40:21,586 --> 00:40:24,005
- Put your arms down. Come around here.
- Unbelievable.

578
00:40:24,172 --> 00:40:26,258
So what are you gonna
do about this guy?

579
00:40:27,968 --> 00:40:31,388
What, no hello?
That's fucking rude.

580
00:40:31,555 --> 00:40:34,391
Oh, I'm sorry. Hello.

581
00:40:34,558 --> 00:40:36,935
Now what the fuck are you
gonna do about this guy?

582
00:40:37,102 --> 00:40:39,479
He came to my house
last night, Vince.

583
00:40:39,646 --> 00:40:41,231
My house.

584
00:40:41,398 --> 00:40:44,109
This is your fuck up.
This was your end of the deal.

585
00:40:44,276 --> 00:40:45,944
- My end?
- Yes.

586
00:40:46,111 --> 00:40:48,822
Now take care of it.

587
00:40:48,989 --> 00:40:50,740
What did you tell him?

588
00:40:50,907 --> 00:40:51,950
What do you mean?

589
00:40:52,117 --> 00:40:54,953
I mean what
did you tell him?

590
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:57,539
Uh, how about not a goddamn thing?
What are you talking about?

591
00:40:57,706 --> 00:41:00,292
Russell, I know how weak you are,
so just tell me what you told him.

592
00:41:00,459 --> 00:41:02,335
I didn't-- I didn't say--
I didn't say anything.

593
00:41:02,502 --> 00:41:05,130
You're still alive.

594
00:41:05,297 --> 00:41:07,132
That means you
told him something.

595
00:41:07,299 --> 00:41:09,468
Now I want to know
what the fuck it was.

596
00:41:09,634 --> 00:41:12,012
Okay, you know what?
Yes.

597
00:41:12,179 --> 00:41:15,223
I told you
from the beginning

598
00:41:15,390 --> 00:41:17,601
there could be
no loose ends, Vince.

599
00:41:17,767 --> 00:41:20,020
You needed money.
I told you how to get it.

600
00:41:20,187 --> 00:41:22,314
Somewhere along the line
you fucked up.

601
00:41:22,481 --> 00:41:25,650
These were your friends.
You should have handled it.

602
00:41:25,817 --> 00:41:27,819
( choking )

603
00:41:36,953 --> 00:41:39,080
Get that shit
out of here, Markus.

604
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:46,838
I-I can't believe
we're related.

605
00:41:47,005 --> 00:41:50,675
I fucked this guy for months
to make this deal happen.

606
00:41:50,842 --> 00:41:53,637
I never did like
the idea of you fucking him.

607
00:41:53,803 --> 00:41:56,640
You know what
we had to do, Vince.

608
00:41:56,806 --> 00:41:58,266
Now what about Sonny?

609
00:41:58,433 --> 00:42:00,727
I'm gonna handle it.

610
00:42:00,894 --> 00:42:02,103
( scoffs )

611
00:42:02,270 --> 00:42:04,397
How did he look?

612
00:42:04,564 --> 00:42:07,359
How the fuck do you think he looked?
He looked pissed off.

613
00:42:07,526 --> 00:42:10,028
I hope you know
what you're doing, Vince.

614
00:42:14,074 --> 00:42:16,952
( clock chiming )

615
00:42:19,871 --> 00:42:22,290
- Mr. B.
- Yeah, Tony?

616
00:42:27,295 --> 00:42:28,880
( sighs )

617
00:42:29,047 --> 00:42:31,258
You know, one of the greatest
pleasures of my life

618
00:42:31,424 --> 00:42:35,136
is eating my breakfast
and reading the sports page.

619
00:42:36,555 --> 00:42:38,223
I like reading the box scores.

620
00:42:38,390 --> 00:42:40,559
I like seeing who wins,
who loses.

621
00:42:40,725 --> 00:42:44,062
It relaxes me.
You know what I mean?

622
00:42:45,647 --> 00:42:47,148
( sighs )

623
00:42:50,235 --> 00:42:52,320
Now they say

624
00:42:52,487 --> 00:42:54,990
that they're gonna stop
publishing newspapers

625
00:42:55,156 --> 00:42:57,367
so people can read the stats
and the box scores

626
00:42:57,534 --> 00:42:59,369
on their fucking cell phone.

627
00:42:59,536 --> 00:43:02,080
Who wants to look at a cell phone
when you're eating food?

628
00:43:02,247 --> 00:43:05,083
It's ridiculous.
I'll tell you what it is--

629
00:43:05,250 --> 00:43:07,752
uncivilized.

630
00:43:07,919 --> 00:43:10,255
It's a different world.

631
00:43:10,422 --> 00:43:12,382
Same world,

632
00:43:12,549 --> 00:43:14,426
different toys.

633
00:43:17,387 --> 00:43:19,180
What do you hear
about Petey and the kid?

634
00:43:19,347 --> 00:43:21,182
Nothing yet.

635
00:43:21,349 --> 00:43:23,476
But we grabbed one
of the Russians this morning.

636
00:43:23,643 --> 00:43:25,854
Sal's softening him up
right now.

637
00:43:26,021 --> 00:43:28,440
All right.
Go take a look.

638
00:43:28,607 --> 00:43:31,276
I'll be down there
in a little bit, all right?

639
00:43:31,443 --> 00:43:33,445
- Give me a call if something changes.
- All right.

640
00:43:33,612 --> 00:43:35,864
Will do, boss.

641
00:43:49,544 --> 00:43:51,963
Boss.

642
00:43:54,132 --> 00:43:55,842
What did Petey's mom say?

643
00:43:56,009 --> 00:43:58,178
She hasn't heard anything.

644
00:43:58,345 --> 00:44:00,847
And the sisters,
no one's seen him.

645
00:44:03,224 --> 00:44:04,809
This way.

646
00:44:06,311 --> 00:44:08,313
Thanks.

647
00:44:13,860 --> 00:44:17,489
How's it going, Sal?
He tell you anything?

648
00:44:17,656 --> 00:44:21,951
- Not much.
- Hey, Ivan.

649
00:44:22,118 --> 00:44:24,663
Oh. Hey, buddy.

650
00:44:27,499 --> 00:44:29,459
Hey. Hey.

651
00:44:30,835 --> 00:44:34,172
How you doing in there?

652
00:44:34,339 --> 00:44:37,884
Sal, this defeats the whole fucking
purpose of interrogating him.

653
00:44:38,051 --> 00:44:40,470
How are you gonna get anything
out of him if he's dead?

654
00:44:40,637 --> 00:44:43,431
You brought me all the way
down here for this?

655
00:44:43,598 --> 00:44:45,433
Now you've got to go get
another Russian, all right?

656
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:48,853
( man whispering )

657
00:45:06,913 --> 00:45:09,124
I was hoping I'd see
you again, my son.

658
00:45:09,290 --> 00:45:11,459
You can leave
the burden of life

659
00:45:11,626 --> 00:45:13,211
at the door
of God's house.

660
00:45:13,378 --> 00:45:16,715
You really believe
all this shit, Father?

661
00:45:18,425 --> 00:45:21,136
I mean, if He made good
He also made bad, right?

662
00:45:24,431 --> 00:45:26,516
Do you believe in free will?

663
00:45:26,683 --> 00:45:28,435
The idea that you are free

664
00:45:28,601 --> 00:45:30,770
to make your own choice
in this world.

665
00:45:30,937 --> 00:45:32,355
Of course.

666
00:45:32,522 --> 00:45:35,150
Then how could you make a choice
between right and wrong

667
00:45:35,316 --> 00:45:37,902
if God did not offer
the two extremes?

668
00:45:38,069 --> 00:45:41,573
The path to God is based
upon your ability

669
00:45:41,740 --> 00:45:44,451
as a thinking, feeling being

670
00:45:44,617 --> 00:45:46,494
to make the correct
decisions.

671
00:45:46,661 --> 00:45:49,748
If everything was perfect,
then you wouldn't be on earth.

672
00:45:49,914 --> 00:45:52,917
You'd already be in heaven.

673
00:45:53,084 --> 00:45:55,044
You don't live
in my world, Father.

674
00:45:55,211 --> 00:45:58,757
God can forgive
almost anything, my son.

675
00:46:00,175 --> 00:46:02,927
But you must open
your heart to Him.

676
00:46:13,563 --> 00:46:16,107
( control tower chatter )

677
00:46:41,633 --> 00:46:43,051
Aw, Christ.

678
00:46:43,218 --> 00:46:45,678
Back five fucking minutes,
I got to deal with this asshole.

679
00:46:45,845 --> 00:46:47,305
Vincent:
Hey, Johnny.

680
00:46:47,472 --> 00:46:50,642
Welcome back.
How was Vegas?

681
00:46:50,809 --> 00:46:52,143
- Hot.
- Yeah?

682
00:46:52,310 --> 00:46:53,895
Yeah, what else
you want to know?

683
00:46:54,062 --> 00:46:57,398
-I need to talk to you.
- I heard you got a problem with ghosts.

684
00:46:57,565 --> 00:46:59,150
- Ghosts?
- Yeah.

685
00:46:59,317 --> 00:47:00,693
People that should
be dead, but ain't.

686
00:47:00,860 --> 00:47:03,154
What the fuck did I tell you?
If you're gonna whack someone,

687
00:47:03,321 --> 00:47:05,448
you put two in the head. That way
they can't come back for you.

688
00:47:05,615 --> 00:47:07,325
- Yeah, I know.
- You know, but you didn't do that,

689
00:47:07,492 --> 00:47:09,577
did you?
Now you got problems.

690
00:47:09,744 --> 00:47:11,746
Yeah, I was kind of hoping
you could help me out.

691
00:47:11,913 --> 00:47:13,957
I already helped you out.
I took care of the cops.

692
00:47:14,123 --> 00:47:15,875
Come on, man, you got a cut.

693
00:47:16,042 --> 00:47:18,920
For protection. I ain't going
to war for you, kid.

694
00:47:19,087 --> 00:47:21,840
- I'm not asking you to go to war for--
- You shut the fuck up.

695
00:47:22,006 --> 00:47:26,094
Listen, that friend of yours,
somehow he got Biggs involved.

696
00:47:26,261 --> 00:47:27,887
That changed everything.

697
00:47:28,054 --> 00:47:30,932
This guy don't fuck around.
He's the most ruthless,

698
00:47:31,099 --> 00:47:34,185
cold motherfucker you'll ever meet.
You know what happened

699
00:47:34,352 --> 00:47:36,604
-to the last guy who fucked with him?
- No.

700
00:47:36,771 --> 00:47:38,898
Let's just say he got
a closed-casket funeral.

701
00:47:39,065 --> 00:47:42,318
I can't do anything on this.
You're on your own.

702
00:47:42,485 --> 00:47:44,821
( huffs )
All right.

703
00:47:44,988 --> 00:47:47,031
And I'll tell you something else.

704
00:47:47,198 --> 00:47:50,869
If Biggs reaches out for me,
I'm gonna deliver you.

705
00:47:51,035 --> 00:47:53,454
Just like that?

706
00:47:53,621 --> 00:47:55,957
It's business.

707
00:48:02,547 --> 00:48:04,632
John.

708
00:48:05,884 --> 00:48:08,052
Fuck.

709
00:48:43,421 --> 00:48:45,423
( sniffles )

710
00:49:12,158 --> 00:49:14,953
Sonny?

711
00:49:20,667 --> 00:49:22,877
- Hey.
- I'm sorry.

712
00:49:23,878 --> 00:49:26,255
( Sobs )

713
00:49:42,063 --> 00:49:44,482
He always said that

714
00:49:44,649 --> 00:49:47,402
he'd be okay as long
as you were there.

715
00:49:53,741 --> 00:49:55,660
I'll make it better.

716
00:50:28,026 --> 00:50:29,485
Long time.

717
00:50:30,737 --> 00:50:32,155
Only 13 years.

718
00:50:32,321 --> 00:50:34,032
I can't help you.

719
00:50:34,198 --> 00:50:36,034
I didn't come here
to ask you for your help.

720
00:50:36,200 --> 00:50:37,702
Well, then why
don't you get to it?

721
00:50:37,869 --> 00:50:40,163
They only let me out of
my cage for about 15 minutes.

722
00:50:40,329 --> 00:50:43,583
I came to ask

723
00:50:43,750 --> 00:50:46,127
is there anything you
want me to tell your son

724
00:50:46,294 --> 00:50:48,796
before I kill him?

725
00:50:51,841 --> 00:50:54,385
You know, if this glass wasn't
between us I'd break your fucking neck

726
00:50:54,552 --> 00:50:56,262
- for talking to me that way!
- The glass is there.

727
00:50:56,429 --> 00:50:57,847
Hey. Hey!

728
00:50:58,014 --> 00:50:59,640
- That's it, let's go.
- You hear that?

729
00:50:59,807 --> 00:51:02,351
That's it, let's go.
Let's go.

730
00:51:02,518 --> 00:51:04,479
- That's it.
- This crazy motherfucker.

731
00:51:04,645 --> 00:51:06,898
All right, all right.

732
00:51:11,527 --> 00:51:13,863
- Is he here?
- Yeah, but he's busy right--

733
00:51:14,030 --> 00:51:16,074
What the fuck? Mia.

734
00:51:17,408 --> 00:51:19,077
So you gonna be around
later on?

735
00:51:21,829 --> 00:51:23,498
- Yo, Mia, what the fuck?
- Get rid of her.

736
00:51:23,664 --> 00:51:25,500
- Hey.
- What?

737
00:51:25,666 --> 00:51:27,794
Get your shit
and get going.

738
00:51:29,504 --> 00:51:32,548
I guess just go.

739
00:51:32,715 --> 00:51:34,592
You're a fucking asshole.

740
00:51:36,260 --> 00:51:38,930
This is why we're in a world
of shit, Vincent.

741
00:51:39,097 --> 00:51:40,765
Because you're off
fucking around

742
00:51:40,932 --> 00:51:42,350
instead of taking care
of business.

743
00:51:42,517 --> 00:51:44,519
Calm down.
I'm tying up the loose ends.

744
00:51:44,685 --> 00:51:48,439
Loose ends? The only fucking
loose end is Sonny.

745
00:51:48,606 --> 00:51:52,235
I am telling you, Vincent,
do not underestimate him.

746
00:51:52,401 --> 00:51:54,112
I grew up with Sonny.
He's a hothead.

747
00:51:54,278 --> 00:51:56,197
He'll always come through
the front door.

748
00:51:56,364 --> 00:51:58,241
Great, so we'll just wait
for the doorbell to ring, right?

749
00:51:58,407 --> 00:52:00,409
Mia, enough.

750
00:52:16,384 --> 00:52:19,220
Man on P.A.: We need a backup
register open, please.

751
00:52:19,387 --> 00:52:21,681
Backup register open, please.

752
00:52:26,310 --> 00:52:27,812
This what you want?

753
00:52:30,773 --> 00:52:32,942
All cashiers
please come to the front.

754
00:52:33,109 --> 00:52:35,111
All cashiers to the front.

755
00:52:50,751 --> 00:52:53,588
-( knocking )
- It's open, Vincent.

756
00:52:57,008 --> 00:52:58,926
( gasps )

757
00:53:01,095 --> 00:53:03,681
- ( grunts )
- ( screams )

758
00:53:05,433 --> 00:53:07,894
We're done with
the small talk, hmm?

759
00:53:08,060 --> 00:53:09,896
( panting )

760
00:53:10,062 --> 00:53:11,522
Where are my diamonds?

761
00:53:11,689 --> 00:53:13,399
I sold them.

762
00:53:13,566 --> 00:53:16,027
( tisks )
Wrong answer.

763
00:53:16,194 --> 00:53:18,905
(whimpering )

764
00:53:21,073 --> 00:53:23,367
Oh, come on.

765
00:53:28,539 --> 00:53:30,917
( moans )

766
00:53:31,083 --> 00:53:34,378
So this is fun for you?
Huh?

767
00:53:34,545 --> 00:53:36,380
( coughs )

768
00:53:36,547 --> 00:53:38,132
Want to go again?

769
00:53:38,299 --> 00:53:40,718
You have a lot
of nice things here.

770
00:53:40,885 --> 00:53:42,970
( coughs )

771
00:53:46,974 --> 00:53:49,518
( sighs )

772
00:53:49,685 --> 00:53:51,562
Is this all worth it?

773
00:53:54,357 --> 00:53:57,151
Yeah, it is.

774
00:53:57,318 --> 00:54:00,738
Ooh, scary-- blood.

775
00:54:03,574 --> 00:54:05,576
- ( shatters )
- ( whimpers )

776
00:54:08,955 --> 00:54:12,792
Give me my diamonds
and we're done.

777
00:54:12,959 --> 00:54:15,211
Fuck you!

778
00:54:40,945 --> 00:54:42,780
Fuck, man.
I'm starving.

779
00:54:42,947 --> 00:54:45,825
We'll get something
on the way back home.

780
00:54:47,243 --> 00:54:48,869
What you in the mood for?

781
00:54:49,036 --> 00:54:51,038
Shit, like a fucking salad.

782
00:54:51,205 --> 00:54:52,915
What the hell?

783
00:54:53,082 --> 00:54:55,126
What's wrong with you, man?

784
00:54:58,838 --> 00:55:01,549
Yo, Mia.

785
00:55:04,343 --> 00:55:06,762
Mia.

786
00:55:25,781 --> 00:55:27,616
Fuck.

787
00:55:31,996 --> 00:55:34,206
Mia?

788
00:55:41,797 --> 00:55:43,674
Fuck.

789
00:55:50,473 --> 00:55:52,683
Oh fuck.

790
00:55:54,685 --> 00:55:57,480
We've got to get
the fuck out of here, Vince.

791
00:55:57,646 --> 00:56:00,358
We've got to go.

792
00:56:00,524 --> 00:56:02,526
- Let's go.
- Get off me!

793
00:56:02,693 --> 00:56:06,030
I'm sorry, man.
We've got to get the fuck out of here.

794
00:56:06,197 --> 00:56:08,115
Shut up.

795
00:56:19,001 --> 00:56:21,504
I'm sorry, girl.

796
00:56:39,855 --> 00:56:41,399
( muffled screams )

797
00:56:41,565 --> 00:56:44,443
- Biggs: Frankie, how's it going?
- Nothing, boss.

798
00:56:44,610 --> 00:56:46,070
No one's seen
or heard anything.

799
00:56:46,237 --> 00:56:47,988
They must have whacked
the both of them.

800
00:56:48,155 --> 00:56:50,408
Listen, you stupid fucking
Russian son of a bitch,

801
00:56:50,574 --> 00:56:52,743
if you're not gonna plan
on growing gills anytime soon,

802
00:56:52,910 --> 00:56:54,870
I'd suggest you tell the man
what he wants to know.

803
00:56:55,037 --> 00:56:56,997
Black man took the money.

804
00:56:57,164 --> 00:56:59,625
That's all I see.
He took it.

805
00:57:09,009 --> 00:57:12,179
10 bucks says when he comes up
for air he starts screaming about God.

806
00:57:12,346 --> 00:57:13,431
- 20.
- Bet.

807
00:57:13,597 --> 00:57:15,391
Tony:
Bring him up.

808
00:57:15,558 --> 00:57:18,394
( sputtering )

809
00:57:18,561 --> 00:57:20,604
Oh, mother of God!

810
00:57:20,771 --> 00:57:22,857
( laughs )

811
00:57:23,023 --> 00:57:25,943
Hey, Aqualung.

812
00:57:26,110 --> 00:57:28,112
Let me tell you something.
God ain't here.

813
00:57:28,279 --> 00:57:31,198
Okay?
God has left Detroit.

814
00:57:31,365 --> 00:57:33,451
I'm your only god today.

815
00:57:33,617 --> 00:57:36,537
So you'd better tell me
what happened to my boy Petey,

816
00:57:36,704 --> 00:57:38,330
what happened
to the black man,

817
00:57:38,497 --> 00:57:40,708
and what happened
to my fucking money.

818
00:57:40,875 --> 00:57:43,961
- You hear me?
- Man with gun, he took your money.

819
00:57:44,128 --> 00:57:47,673
He took your money.
I tell the truth. I tell the truth!

820
00:57:47,840 --> 00:57:49,800
( laughs )
You're a tough son of a bitch.

821
00:57:49,967 --> 00:57:51,969
Back in the pool, Tony.

822
00:57:58,100 --> 00:58:01,562
- You see that game last night?
- Yeah.

823
00:58:01,729 --> 00:58:04,148
It was a ball. Way outside.

824
00:58:04,315 --> 00:58:05,941
No fucking way
that was a strike.

825
00:58:06,108 --> 00:58:08,486
Ump walked to the plate,
he couldn't see shit.

826
00:58:08,652 --> 00:58:10,279
- They should use that computer box.
- Yeah.

827
00:58:10,446 --> 00:58:13,157
- Way outside.
- Fuckin' ump is like Mr. fucking Magoo.

828
00:58:13,324 --> 00:58:14,950
He can't see anything.

829
00:58:15,993 --> 00:58:17,745
I think he's drowning, boss.

830
00:58:20,289 --> 00:58:21,832
Pull him up.

831
00:58:26,420 --> 00:58:28,672
-( laughs)
-I think he's dead.

832
00:58:28,839 --> 00:58:30,466
I think he was telling the truth.

833
00:58:30,633 --> 00:58:32,009
( laughs )

834
00:58:32,176 --> 00:58:34,845
Listen, come and get me
after you clean this up.

835
00:58:35,012 --> 00:58:38,098
- I'm gonna go get a massage.
- Will do. Let's get him.

836
00:58:39,475 --> 00:58:41,352
( beeps )

837
00:58:45,731 --> 00:58:47,608
( phone ringing )

838
00:58:49,693 --> 00:58:53,364
Yeah? Yeah, I'll be there.
I'm just running a few minutes late.

839
00:59:21,392 --> 00:59:24,270
- I don't like to be kept waiting.
- Whatever.

840
00:59:32,111 --> 00:59:34,321
- You're light.
- it's all there.

841
00:59:34,488 --> 00:59:37,533
No it isn't.
You're light.

842
00:59:37,700 --> 00:59:39,368
What the fuck are you
trying to say, Saunders?

843
00:59:39,535 --> 00:59:41,412
The warden said
the price went up.

844
00:59:41,579 --> 00:59:43,289
No no no.
We had a deal.

845
00:59:43,455 --> 00:59:46,584
Yeah, you paid for a year's
worth of protection.

846
00:59:46,750 --> 00:59:49,420
And now you're gonna
have to pay more.

847
00:59:49,587 --> 00:59:53,173
You want the old man kept
in protective custody?

848
00:59:53,340 --> 00:59:56,427
You pay $100,000 upfront.

849
00:59:56,594 --> 00:59:58,596
This is bullshit.

850
00:59:58,762 --> 01:00:00,431
How long do you think
that old man's

851
01:00:00,598 --> 01:00:02,933
gonna stay in
the general population?

852
01:00:03,100 --> 01:00:06,478
I give him two days before
the brothers cut him a new one.

853
01:00:06,645 --> 01:00:08,814
You want that on your head?

854
01:00:08,981 --> 01:00:13,152
I know you're about family,
so do the right thing, Vince.

855
01:00:13,319 --> 01:00:15,571
Be the good son.

856
01:00:21,368 --> 01:00:24,872
You'd better think this through
before you pull that trigger.

857
01:00:26,165 --> 01:00:27,791
You fuck up with us

858
01:00:27,958 --> 01:00:30,002
and your old man's
a stain on the floor.

859
01:00:30,169 --> 01:00:32,504
Got it?

860
01:00:32,671 --> 01:00:35,591
You got 24 hours.

861
01:00:35,758 --> 01:00:37,926
Or we feed him to the animals.

862
01:00:38,093 --> 01:00:40,220
Get out.

863
01:01:19,301 --> 01:01:21,303
Mia's dead.

864
01:01:28,686 --> 01:01:30,354
What do you want me to say?

865
01:01:30,521 --> 01:01:33,524
Say fucking something.
Anything.

866
01:01:33,691 --> 01:01:34,817
There's nothing to say.

867
01:01:34,983 --> 01:01:36,652
You don't even
want to know how?

868
01:01:36,819 --> 01:01:38,404
It doesn't fucking matter.

869
01:01:38,570 --> 01:01:40,698
You're out there making
mistake after mistake.

870
01:01:40,864 --> 01:01:42,366
And you wonder why she's dead?

871
01:01:42,533 --> 01:01:43,951
What am I doing wrong?

872
01:01:44,118 --> 01:01:46,453
Well, Sonny for one.

873
01:01:48,664 --> 01:01:50,332
How do you know
about Sonny?

874
01:01:50,499 --> 01:01:52,209
He came to visit me.

875
01:01:52,376 --> 01:01:54,128
He sat right where
you're sitting right now

876
01:01:54,294 --> 01:01:57,047
on the other side of this glass
and he looked me in the eye.

877
01:01:57,214 --> 01:01:59,717
Can you do the same?

878
01:02:01,719 --> 01:02:03,345
I'm doing my best.

879
01:02:03,512 --> 01:02:05,097
Well, it's not good enough.

880
01:02:05,264 --> 01:02:07,141
What am I supposed to do?

881
01:02:07,307 --> 01:02:09,309
( sighs )

882
01:02:11,812 --> 01:02:14,732
You really are a little shit.
You know that?

883
01:02:14,898 --> 01:02:17,109
I never thought
I'd have to say that.

884
01:02:17,276 --> 01:02:21,196
Big men make
big moves, Vincent.

885
01:02:21,363 --> 01:02:23,907
Are you a big man?

886
01:03:11,830 --> 01:03:13,791
( groans )

887
01:03:51,119 --> 01:03:52,996
Hey.

888
01:04:24,403 --> 01:04:26,780
Sonny's voice: I knew Biggs
had to be hot on my trail.

889
01:04:26,947 --> 01:04:29,157
You don't take $2 million
from a guy like that

890
01:04:29,324 --> 01:04:31,076
and expect him
to forget about it.

891
01:04:35,747 --> 01:04:38,584
Biggs: No no, you've got
to explain it to me again.

892
01:04:40,210 --> 01:04:42,796
The same guy that
shot you whacked Petey,

893
01:04:42,963 --> 01:04:45,841
took my money, and you want me
to believe that?

894
01:04:46,008 --> 01:04:47,718
Yes.

895
01:04:47,885 --> 01:04:51,179
I told you I was looking for him
when you first grabbed me, remember?

896
01:04:51,346 --> 01:04:53,515
You think I'd be sitting here
if I had your money?

897
01:04:53,682 --> 01:04:55,976
Shit, I ain't crazy.

898
01:05:01,398 --> 01:05:02,816
What?

899
01:05:05,777 --> 01:05:09,281
- Where's my money?
- Vincent has your money.

900
01:05:09,448 --> 01:05:11,700
Your friend Vincent?

901
01:05:11,867 --> 01:05:13,660
Yes.

902
01:05:13,827 --> 01:05:17,122
I know where Vincent is
and I know where the money is.

903
01:05:17,289 --> 01:05:20,208
There's just one problem.
He's got an army around him.

904
01:05:20,375 --> 01:05:23,837
An army of juvenile
delinquents with pistols?

905
01:05:24,004 --> 01:05:26,673
Give me some of your men and we'll go
get the money and bring it right back.

906
01:05:26,840 --> 01:05:30,427
I have a different plan.
Come on.

907
01:05:39,144 --> 01:05:40,604
You all right?

908
01:05:40,771 --> 01:05:42,230
Yeah, I'm cool.

909
01:05:42,397 --> 01:05:44,524
You sure?

910
01:05:46,526 --> 01:05:48,362
All right.

911
01:05:49,863 --> 01:05:51,365
You want a drink?

912
01:05:51,531 --> 01:05:53,575
No thank you.

913
01:05:54,660 --> 01:05:56,411
Might help you relax a little.

914
01:06:00,832 --> 01:06:03,877
Why is it rich people
are always telling me to relax?

915
01:06:05,671 --> 01:06:08,840
'Cause you're young.
You're a young man.

916
01:06:09,007 --> 01:06:12,469
Young guys just want
to run through their life

917
01:06:12,636 --> 01:06:14,054
as fast as they can.

918
01:06:14,221 --> 01:06:17,557
Set it up, knock it down.
Set it up, knock it down.

919
01:06:19,309 --> 01:06:21,436
It's short, real short.

920
01:06:21,603 --> 01:06:24,356
You get to be my age
you see just how short it is.

921
01:06:24,523 --> 01:06:27,567
The older you get, the closer
you get to your death,

922
01:06:27,734 --> 01:06:30,570
you want to relax.
You want to take your time.

923
01:06:32,155 --> 01:06:33,824
There's no rush, kid.

924
01:06:36,994 --> 01:06:38,787
You sure you don't want
that drink?

925
01:06:40,831 --> 01:06:42,833
Yeah, I'll take a drink.

926
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:45,669
- Bourbon or Scotch?
- Bourbon.

927
01:07:07,691 --> 01:07:09,693
Crap.

928
01:07:14,197 --> 01:07:16,533
You should know I hate
this John R prick.

929
01:07:16,700 --> 01:07:19,828
Just let me do the talking
when we get there, all right?

930
01:07:36,762 --> 01:07:38,472
Hey, you go to church?

931
01:07:40,265 --> 01:07:42,392
I used to.

932
01:07:42,559 --> 01:07:45,437
It got to a point they didn't want
to see me there anymore.

933
01:07:47,981 --> 01:07:50,108
I still help them out
with donations.

934
01:07:51,902 --> 01:07:55,155
I could see those priests
up there sweating.

935
01:07:55,322 --> 01:07:57,407
I made them nervous.

936
01:07:57,574 --> 01:07:59,868
So you believe in God?

937
01:08:00,035 --> 01:08:02,996
I don't know
if I believe in their God.

938
01:08:03,163 --> 01:08:06,792
Yeah, I pray.

939
01:08:08,085 --> 01:08:09,711
I pray every night.

940
01:08:09,878 --> 01:08:13,090
I need a God that's got
a lot of forgiveness.

941
01:08:16,259 --> 01:08:18,261
You're gonna be
all right though.

942
01:08:18,428 --> 01:08:20,138
Don't worry about a thing.

943
01:09:01,304 --> 01:09:04,474
What's the matter, Vince? You look
like you've seen a fucking ghost.

944
01:09:12,649 --> 01:09:15,527
- You know why we're here, John?
- Yeah, I know.

945
01:09:15,694 --> 01:09:17,362
That's the kid
you wanted to see.

946
01:09:18,572 --> 01:09:19,948
Consider him delivered.

947
01:09:20,115 --> 01:09:22,284
Where's my money?

948
01:09:22,450 --> 01:09:23,827
I don't know
what you're talking about.

949
01:09:23,994 --> 01:09:25,495
Give him
his fucking money, Vince.

950
01:09:25,662 --> 01:09:27,873
I don't know what this dude
told you, but it's bullshit.

951
01:09:29,416 --> 01:09:31,501
Last chance.

952
01:09:33,587 --> 01:09:35,380
With all due respect,
I know exactly who you are

953
01:09:35,547 --> 01:09:37,257
and I would never
fucking steal--

954
01:09:37,424 --> 01:09:39,759
John: Jesus Christ!
Take it easy.

955
01:09:39,926 --> 01:09:41,928
Everybody just take it easy.
God damn it.

956
01:09:42,095 --> 01:09:43,680
That's for Petey.

957
01:09:45,640 --> 01:09:48,226
John: You got something
of this man's, you give it to him now.

958
01:09:48,393 --> 01:09:50,020
Or we could all die, John.

959
01:09:54,107 --> 01:09:55,901
(grunts)

960
01:09:56,067 --> 01:09:58,111
( gunshots )

961
01:10:38,276 --> 01:10:40,070
Shit.

962
01:10:50,830 --> 01:10:52,415
Oh! Hey!

963
01:11:03,301 --> 01:11:05,345
- ( tires screech )
-( horn honks )

964
01:11:12,894 --> 01:11:14,604
(grunts)

965
01:11:22,570 --> 01:11:25,115
- Move!
-( pans clatter)

966
01:11:27,867 --> 01:11:30,453
- ( gunshots )
-( people screaming )

967
01:11:45,510 --> 01:11:47,637
Woman:
Watch out.

968
01:12:13,955 --> 01:12:15,790
Fuck!

969
01:12:32,849 --> 01:12:34,934
(dialing )

970
01:12:36,686 --> 01:12:39,481
Saunders, don't you
fucking move my dad.

971
01:12:39,647 --> 01:12:42,025
I've got your money
and I'll be there in an hour.

972
01:12:45,445 --> 01:12:47,405
Going somewhere?

973
01:12:47,572 --> 01:12:49,908
Who the fuck are you?

974
01:12:50,075 --> 01:12:51,534
That's not the topic.

975
01:12:51,701 --> 01:12:53,328
All right,
what is the topic?

976
01:12:53,495 --> 01:12:55,705
Diamonds.
Mm-hmm.

977
01:12:55,872 --> 01:12:58,083
That's right.
Sit down.

978
01:12:58,249 --> 01:13:00,460
Sit down!

979
01:13:03,546 --> 01:13:07,300
You know, in some countries
they cut off the hand that steals.

980
01:13:07,467 --> 01:13:09,511
And you stole from us.

981
01:13:09,677 --> 01:13:12,722
So the way I see it,
you have three choices:

982
01:13:12,889 --> 01:13:15,225
you can fuck around,

983
01:13:15,392 --> 01:13:17,310
in which case I kill you;

984
01:13:17,477 --> 01:13:20,980
you can go for that gun
on the desk

985
01:13:21,147 --> 01:13:23,608
and I kill you;

986
01:13:23,775 --> 01:13:27,529
or you can just
give me the diamonds

987
01:13:27,695 --> 01:13:29,030
and I'll let you disappear.

988
01:13:29,197 --> 01:13:31,074
Yeah right.

989
01:13:31,241 --> 01:13:33,451
Look, my friend,

990
01:13:33,618 --> 01:13:36,913
you're not half as tough
as your little girlfriend.

991
01:13:37,080 --> 01:13:39,416
And at the end

992
01:13:39,582 --> 01:13:41,292
she talked.

993
01:13:43,169 --> 01:13:45,755
So what is it going to be?

994
01:13:45,922 --> 01:13:47,841
She wasn't my girlfriend.

995
01:13:48,007 --> 01:13:50,260
She was my family.

996
01:13:51,886 --> 01:13:53,346
- ( gunshot )
- ( screams )

997
01:13:57,434 --> 01:13:59,853
You got off easy,
motherfucker.

998
01:15:06,836 --> 01:15:08,296
(grunts)

999
01:15:08,463 --> 01:15:10,798
( groans )

1000
01:15:12,759 --> 01:15:15,178
( Vincent coughing )

1001
01:15:23,311 --> 01:15:26,689
( coughing, sputtering )

1002
01:15:39,953 --> 01:15:41,621
(coughing )

1003
01:15:47,752 --> 01:15:50,004
isn't much fun dying,
huh, Vince?

1004
01:15:51,047 --> 01:15:53,132
Start digging.

1005
01:15:53,299 --> 01:15:56,052
Are you fucking
kidding me, man?

1006
01:15:56,219 --> 01:15:58,596
You want me to dig
my own goddamn grave?

1007
01:15:58,763 --> 01:16:02,267
Don't make me say it again.
I said start digging.

1008
01:16:04,269 --> 01:16:06,437
And make sure it's deep
so you're comfortable.

1009
01:16:06,604 --> 01:16:08,982
How much do you want?

1010
01:16:09,148 --> 01:16:12,527
Huh? How much is my life
worth to you?

1011
01:16:12,694 --> 01:16:16,281
A rat's skin is only worth
something to a rat, Vince.

1012
01:16:16,447 --> 01:16:19,534
Man, bullshit.
Come on.

1013
01:16:19,701 --> 01:16:21,995
Who are you to judge me?

1014
01:16:22,161 --> 01:16:25,415
You ever thought about where
the fuck you'd be without me?

1015
01:16:27,500 --> 01:16:29,752
Yeah, I thought about that

1016
01:16:29,919 --> 01:16:32,171
when I thought I was
taking my last breath.

1017
01:16:32,338 --> 01:16:35,883
Man, who was the one
out there making contacts,

1018
01:16:36,050 --> 01:16:38,094
setting up scores while you
and Dave was getting high?

1019
01:16:38,261 --> 01:16:39,804
Huh? Me.

1020
01:16:39,971 --> 01:16:41,723
Who was the one who
brought you in on shit,

1021
01:16:41,889 --> 01:16:44,559
put money in your pockets,
helped you support your moms?

1022
01:16:44,726 --> 01:16:47,645
- Me!
- That's what I don't understand, man.

1023
01:16:47,812 --> 01:16:49,314
That's what--

1024
01:16:49,480 --> 01:16:51,983
We were family, man.
We were brothers.

1025
01:16:52,150 --> 01:16:55,486
- You, me and Dave--
- Fuck Dave, dude.

1026
01:16:55,653 --> 01:16:57,572
Come on.
That stuttering little bitch.

1027
01:16:57,739 --> 01:16:59,365
This is about us, man.

1028
01:16:59,532 --> 01:17:02,452
How long before him and his big-ass
mouth would have got us all whacked?

1029
01:17:02,619 --> 01:17:05,288
- ( gunshot)
- ( groaning )

1030
01:17:09,083 --> 01:17:11,836
- He was loyal.
- ( groaning )

1031
01:17:15,131 --> 01:17:17,216
He was weak.

1032
01:17:17,383 --> 01:17:19,427
He was my friend.

1033
01:17:19,594 --> 01:17:21,012
Just like you, Vince.
Remember?

1034
01:17:21,179 --> 01:17:23,056
Oh fuck.

1035
01:17:24,307 --> 01:17:27,769
Let me tell you something
as your friend, Sonny.

1036
01:17:27,935 --> 01:17:30,938
Everything you got in this world
is because of me.

1037
01:17:31,105 --> 01:17:34,025
Everything you fucking are
in this world

1038
01:17:34,192 --> 01:17:36,611
is because of me.

1039
01:17:36,778 --> 01:17:38,696
What could you have gotten into

1040
01:17:38,863 --> 01:17:40,740
that was so bad that you
couldn't tell me?

1041
01:17:40,907 --> 01:17:43,701
Huh?
Tell me, I want to know.

1042
01:17:46,412 --> 01:17:48,831
I had your back
since we were kids, man.

1043
01:17:48,998 --> 01:17:51,751
And what do you do? You fucking
shoot me and leave me for dead.

1044
01:17:51,918 --> 01:17:55,088
I had no choice, man.
I was in over my head.

1045
01:17:55,254 --> 01:17:57,674
I couldn't--
I needed all the money.

1046
01:17:57,840 --> 01:18:00,051
They were gonna--
they were gonna kill my father.

1047
01:18:00,218 --> 01:18:03,012
- What?
- They were gonna kill my dad.

1048
01:18:04,555 --> 01:18:08,184
Sonny, you're right, man.

1049
01:18:08,351 --> 01:18:10,853
And I'm sorry.
I should have come to you.

1050
01:18:12,730 --> 01:18:15,274
But you-- you've gotta tell me,
what can I do right now?

1051
01:18:15,441 --> 01:18:18,653
How can I make this right, man?
Tell me what to do.

1052
01:18:20,238 --> 01:18:22,699
You should have thought
about that before.

1053
01:18:24,283 --> 01:18:27,286
You make peace with God,
not me.

1054
01:18:27,453 --> 01:18:29,622
Do it.

1055
01:18:29,789 --> 01:18:32,542
Fucking do it, Sonny.
Shoot my ass.

1056
01:18:32,709 --> 01:18:35,586
'Cause you know what? You ain't nothing
in this world without me, man.

1057
01:18:35,753 --> 01:18:38,589
You shoot me
and we're the same.

1058
01:18:38,756 --> 01:18:40,842
We'll both be gone.

1059
01:18:47,432 --> 01:18:49,267
We're not the same.

1060
01:18:51,561 --> 01:18:53,688
You're fucking pathetic, man.

1061
01:18:55,356 --> 01:18:57,692
Man, fuck you!

1062
01:18:57,859 --> 01:18:59,694
Fuck you, man!

1063
01:18:59,861 --> 01:19:01,320
I don't need you, Sonny.

1064
01:19:01,487 --> 01:19:03,281
I don't need you, man.
You need me.

1065
01:19:03,448 --> 01:19:06,617
You need me!

1066
01:19:06,784 --> 01:19:10,079
I'm gonna walk out of here.
You'll see, man.

1067
01:19:10,246 --> 01:19:13,875
You hear me?
You hear me?!

1068
01:19:14,041 --> 01:19:16,669
Fuck you!

1069
01:19:17,670 --> 01:19:19,172
I'll find your ass!

1070
01:19:19,338 --> 01:19:21,048

- ( grunts )
- Yo, man, check it out. Check it out.

1072
01:19:36,355 --> 01:19:38,232
Man: Yo, it was nice
knowing you, buddy.

1073
01:19:38,399 --> 01:19:40,359
- ( alarm sounding )
- Break it up! Make a hole!

1074

- Back off!

1075

-I need a medic in Red.

- Back up.
- Get back.

1077
01:19:47,825 --> 01:19:50,286
Get back on the wall.
Get back.

1078
01:19:50,453 --> 01:19:53,206
Let me see your hand.
Get your hand out of there.

1079
01:19:58,044 --> 01:19:59,337

- Hi.
