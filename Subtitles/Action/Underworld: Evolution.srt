and others on deception.

374

Viktor was not the first of our kind,
as you were led to believe.

Toward the end of his ruthless life,

383
00:50:23,360 --> 00:50:27,319

to Viktor than silver or gold,

384
00:50:27,520 --> 00:50:30,239
Marcus came with an offer,

387
00:50:36,640 --> 00:50:40,030
And in return, Viktor was
to use his army-turned-immortal
to help him.

388
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:42,598
To do what?

389
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:44,916
To defeat
the very first Werewolves,

390
00:50:45,120 --> 00:50:47,998
a dangerous
and infectious breed

391
00:50:48,200 --> 00:50:50,668
created by Marcus' own
flesh and blood:

392
00:50:52,640 --> 00:50:54,153
His twin brother, William.

393
00:50:56,080 --> 00:50:57,672
But these weren't
the Lycans we know.

394
00:50:58,040 --> 00:51:00,156
Disgusting though
your brethren may be,

395
00:51:00,360 --> 00:51:02,237
they at least are evolved.

396
00:51:02,440 --> 00:51:04,590
No, these were raging monsters.

397
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:07,951
Never able to take
human form again.

398
00:51:08,160 --> 00:51:11,152
It was only later generations
that learned to channel their rage.

399
00:51:11,360 --> 00:51:14,909
And William's appetite
for destruction and rampage
was insatiable.

400
00:51:16,160 --> 00:51:17,513
He had to be stopped.

401
00:51:17,720 --> 00:51:20,029
And so once Viktor's army
was turned,

402
00:51:20,240 --> 00:51:22,515
the legions of Vampires
under his control

403
00:51:22,720 --> 00:51:25,792
tracked down
and destroyed the animals,

404
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:27,228
then captured William

405
00:51:27,840 --> 00:51:29,239
and locked him away.

406
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:31,796
Viktor's prisoner for all time.

407
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:35,549
Why let him live?

408
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:39,833
For the very same reason
that Viktor never conspired
against Marcus: Fear.

409
00:51:40,160 --> 00:51:42,196
He was warned that,
should Marcus ever be killed,

410
00:51:42,680 --> 00:51:45,558
all those in his bloodline
would follow him to the grave.

411
00:51:46,600 --> 00:51:48,431
So in Viktor's mind,

412
00:51:48,640 --> 00:51:51,234
William's death would mean
the end for all Lycans,

413
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:52,475
his slaves.

414
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:55,833
Yes.

415
00:51:57,040 --> 00:51:59,031
Yes, a clever deception,

416
00:51:59,240 --> 00:52:01,879
but one Viktor was hardly
willing to put to the test.

417
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:05,077
And so Marcus was protected

within such a fool.

550
01:05:21,520 --> 01:05:23,192
The eldest of the immortals,

551
01:05:23,680 --> 01:05:27,434
yet you have made no attempt
to seize your destiny.

552
01:05:27,640 --> 01:05:32,760
We are oddities
of nature, you and I.
Nothing more.

553
01:05:32,960 --> 01:05:35,394
This is a world for humanity.

554
01:05:35,600 --> 01:05:39,559
And that petty sentiment explains
why you rejected your sons?

555
01:05:39,760 --> 01:05:42,115
Why you stood by
for over half a millennium

556
01:05:42,320 --> 01:05:45,710
as William suffered alone
in darkness?

557
01:05:46,240 --> 01:05:48,117
No, Father.

558
01:05:48,760 --> 01:05:51,957
I have no respect
for your petty sentiment.

559
01:05:53,760 --> 01:05:56,479
Viktor's key. Where is it?

560
01:05:56,680 --> 01:05:59,319
Whatever plan you have
for William is futile.

561
01:05:59,520 --> 01:06:02,512
You cannot control your brother.
Oh, I am stronger now.

562
01:06:02,720 --> 01:06:05,951
And our bond is greater
than you have ever
wanted to acknowledge.

563
01:06:06,160 --> 01:06:07,388
You're wrong.

564
01:06:07,600 --> 01:06:10,672
Soon you'll be drowning in Lycans,
just like before.

565
01:06:10,880 --> 01:06:12,438
Oh, not Lycans, Father...

566
01:06:12,840 --> 01:06:14,637
or Vampires.

567
01:06:14,840 --> 01:06:19,152
A new race, created in
the image of their maker...

568
01:06:20,200 --> 01:06:21,758
their new god:

569
01:06:24,640 --> 01:06:26,517
Me.

[Music]

571

572
01:06:44,840 --> 01:06:46,398
has no father.

573
01:07:21,080 --> 01:07:22,832
You will fail.

574
01:07:57,240 --> 01:07:58,878
Get the kit.
No.

575
01:08:05,960 --> 01:08:09,077
Please, sir, let us help you.

576
01:08:09,560 --> 01:08:11,471
The time has come,
my friend.

577
01:08:13,040 --> 01:08:14,473
Find the girl.

578
01:08:15,840 --> 01:08:17,831
Bring her to me.

579
01:08:23,120 --> 01:08:24,348
No, wait. Wait.

580
01:08:27,880 --> 01:08:30,872
If you want Marcus,
you'll need Alexander's help.

581
01:08:36,960 --> 01:08:38,359
Don't leave him here.

582
01:08:58,200 --> 01:09:01,715
Did he get the pendant?
Yes.

583
01:09:02,480 --> 01:09:04,994
He's too powerful for you alone.

584
01:09:05,560 --> 01:09:07,516
You are the only one
older than he is,

585
01:09:07,720 --> 01:09:09,597
the only one stronger.

586
01:09:09,800 --> 01:09:12,075
You could have
killed him yourself.

587
01:09:13,240 --> 01:09:16,118
No matter what he's become...

588
01:09:17,480 --> 01:09:18,799
he is my son.

589
01:09:24,880 --> 01:09:27,519
You are the last hope left.

590
01:09:28,440 --> 01:09:31,591
There is only one way
to defeat him.

591
01:09:38,640 --> 01:09:40,596
Quickly, now,

592
01:09:40,800 --> 01:09:44,588
before there is no more legacy
left in my veins.

593
01:09:52,800 --> 01:09:54,836
What will I become?

594
01:09:56,600 --> 01:09:58,158

Head back around
towards the river.

602

I don't see a way inside.

603
01:15:31,480 --> 01:15:33,596
There used to be
a river entrance just there.

604
01:15:33,800 --> 01:15:35,756
It must be submerged now.

605
01:15:35,960 --> 01:15:37,359

No, William. Stop.

slow him down.
