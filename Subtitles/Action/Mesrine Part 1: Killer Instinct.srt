Some events of this movie are based on fiction.
It's not possible to completely show...

4
00:00:23,208 --> 00:00:26,908
complexity of a man's life,
which everybody perceives differently.

Mesrine: Part 1 - Death Instinct

6
00:05:00,669 --> 00:05:04,338
I was born maybe a half mile from here.

7
00:05:22,143 --> 00:05:24,017
Go ahead, go.

8
00:05:24,018 --> 00:05:26,624
- Did you let him in?
- Yeah.

9
00:05:50,493 --> 00:05:53,705
<i>Algeria, 1959.</i>

10
00:05:57,307 --> 00:06:00,037
- I can't...
- Everything will be alright, brother.

11
00:06:00,038 --> 00:06:05,112
Look at me, everything will be fine.
Think about your family.

12
00:06:06,901 --> 00:06:12,597
Look at me.
Where is the bomb?

13
00:06:17,098 --> 00:06:19,069
God won't help you.

14
00:06:21,194 --> 00:06:26,246
- Stop! Let him go!
- Mind your own shit!

15
00:06:26,247 --> 00:06:30,302
- Mesrine!
- I am gonna shake him up.

16
00:06:33,577 --> 00:06:35,762
Talk...

17
00:06:35,763 --> 00:06:37,714
Look at your brother.

18
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:40,947
Do you want a cigarette?

19
00:06:40,948 --> 00:06:44,702
Don't tell them anything, they'll kill you anyway.

20
00:06:44,703 --> 00:06:48,611
I like you, tell me
where is the bomb at?

21
00:06:48,612 --> 00:06:51,430
Nobody has to suffer.

22
00:06:52,376 --> 00:06:56,163
I tell you everything.

23
00:06:56,164 --> 00:06:57,726
Don't tell them anything!

24
00:07:01,007 --> 00:07:02,027
Jasmin!

25
00:07:02,627 --> 00:07:05,374
- Where is the bomb?
- Say nothing!

26
00:07:05,375 --> 00:07:09,378
- Don't tell them!
- Shut her hole!

27
00:07:09,379 --> 00:07:11,945
Leave her alone! That's my sister!

28
00:07:11,946 --> 00:07:15,891
<i>Stop!
Leave her alone!</i>

29
00:07:17,841 --> 00:07:20,219
I play with her for a little bit.

30
00:07:24,170 --> 00:07:27,807
Stop!
I kill you!

31
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:40,962
Kill them!

32
00:07:51,904 --> 00:07:54,304
Shoot!

33
00:07:58,663 --> 00:08:04,175
It's your duty!

34
00:08:10,295 --> 00:08:12,747
No!

35
00:08:15,264 --> 00:08:18,447
Where did you hide the bomb, you bastards?!

36
00:09:52,912 --> 00:09:55,394
Father found you a job.

37
00:09:56,983 --> 00:09:59,216
- Really?
  Yes.

38
00:09:59,217 --> 00:10:05,083
- At the factory.
  Steelmill?  - Yes, right there.

39
00:10:05,084 --> 00:10:13,129
Good factory. If you'll like it over there,
you'll have a good future.

40
00:10:17,787 --> 00:10:20,480
Thank you.

41
00:10:26,895 --> 00:10:29,851
Hey, where you at?

42
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:42,429
- Come down.
- Ok, i'll be right there.

43
00:10:44,031 --> 00:10:46,234
I'll be right back.

44
00:10:46,235 --> 00:10:49,772
- You haven't eaten anything. - Do you have any money?
  Yes, I do.

45
00:10:56,508 --> 00:11:00,866
- So, how was it with the guerilas?
- It was a piece of cake.

46
00:11:02,105 --> 00:11:07,456
- How was Algeria?
- Good. I don't feel like talking about it.

47
00:11:07,457 --> 00:11:12,769
- You have a nice ride. I see you're doing fine.
- I'm not complaining.

48
00:11:12,770 --> 00:11:15,390
I'm doing some work, you know. It's good money.

49
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:18,091
- Tell me more about it.
- I'll tell you  everything about it.

50
00:11:20,001 --> 00:11:23,141
- And where are we going?
- I asked where we are going?

51
00:11:43,070 --> 00:11:46,865
- It's always so many people here.
- Always packed.

52
00:12:04,910 --> 00:12:07,549
Let's go.

53
00:12:12,225 --> 00:12:14,682
Ladies, how are you?

54
00:12:16,807 --> 00:12:19,742
I came with my friend.
Take care of him.

55
00:12:19,743 --> 00:12:22,038
We'll see.

56
00:12:23,478 --> 00:12:26,618
Jacques, come here.

57
00:12:26,619 --> 00:12:30,174
- He's handsome.
- I'll be having fun with Suzan.

58
00:12:31,529 --> 00:12:35,383
- I'm Sarah.
- Sarah...

59
00:12:35,384 --> 00:12:37,788
Haven't we met before?

60
00:12:40,811 --> 00:12:46,159
- Are you in it for the money only?
- Yeah, only when i get paid.

61
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,510
You'll pay me.

62
00:12:48,911 --> 00:12:52,511
You're very nice, but i won't let you go unless you pay me.

63
00:12:53,963 --> 00:12:55,858
We'll see.

64
00:13:08,608 --> 00:13:11,017
Hey guys.

65
00:13:11,018 --> 00:13:14,492
- Where you been?
- Some of us have to work too.

66
00:13:16,414 --> 00:13:20,918
- This is Major.
- This is my payout. Who's dealing?

67
00:13:25,944 --> 00:13:30,436
- You wanna lift?
- I take a walk.

68
00:13:30,437 --> 00:13:33,311
I'm completely broke.
Can i borrow for a cab?

69
00:13:35,983 --> 00:13:39,867
- That's too much. - Are you sure?
- Yeah, thanks.

70
00:13:42,268 --> 00:13:50,901
Listen these your "dirty jobs", could you let me in?  - Yes.

71
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:03,669
- Relax, just push harder.
- Ok.

72
00:14:16,804 --> 00:14:20,392
The safe is behind that bookshelf.

73
00:14:27,525 --> 00:14:30,683
This one?

74
00:15:35,273 --> 00:15:38,541
Look what i found.

75
00:15:38,542 --> 00:15:44,451
- Check it out, so much money is here.
- What a catch.

76
00:15:47,582 --> 00:15:51,105
Thieves!
What do you want here?

77
00:15:51,636 --> 00:15:54,894
- Hello, are you the owners of this apartment?
- Yes. - Excellent.

78
00:15:54,895 --> 00:15:57,750
Inspector Bernar... Romain Japlé.
The Police.

00:15:57,751 --> 00:16:02,809
I must inform you that you've been robbed.

80
00:16:04,179 --> 00:16:09,026
- And that's not all. Those scumbags
 turned your bedroom upside down.
- God!

81
00:16:09,027 --> 00:16:12,349
- Calm down honey.
- Calm down madam. I'm sorry.

82
00:16:12,350 --> 00:16:16,459
- We found this weapon at your place.
- Yes, this is my rifle.

83
00:16:16,460 --> 00:16:21,836
I hope you have a permit for it.
Bring it to the police precinct as soon as possible.

84
00:16:21,837 --> 00:16:26,728
- To be honest, i don't know  where it is...
- Daniel, did you take the fingerprints?   Yes, i did.

85
00:16:26,729 --> 00:16:29,130
Get ready, we're going to laboratory.

86
00:16:29,131 --> 00:16:32,470
- Eduard, come take a look.
- Go, i think missus will be shocked.

87
00:16:32,471 --> 00:16:35,144
Quiet Marie, calm down.

88
00:16:35,145 --> 00:16:38,346
- We'll be expecting you at the precinct tomorrow at 9.
- Ok, we'll be there.

89
00:16:38,347 --> 00:16:40,729
Thank you.

90
00:16:40,730 --> 00:16:46,463
- Listen, Do you still have these kinda jobs?
-  Sure, a plenty.

91
00:16:46,464 --> 00:16:50,274
- Do you want me to introduce you to the boss?
  Who is it? - Guido.

92
00:16:51,908 --> 00:16:55,919
Guido, this is my buddy Jacques Mesrine i talked to you about.

93
00:16:58,744 --> 00:17:01,178
Jacques Mesrine?

94
00:17:02,645 --> 00:17:07,874
- Paul told me a lot about you.
  Thanks.  - Sit down.

95
00:17:10,885 --> 00:17:15,599
When are you going to stop bringing me these 
wandering dogs from the streets?

96
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:19,549
- It's not...  
- Are you talking about me?
- No, not you.

97
00:17:19,550 --> 00:17:22,582
- I asked you something , Paul.
- And i asked you too, grandpa!

98
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:25,125
- What?
- Wandering dogs? You mean me?

99
00:17:25,126 --> 00:17:27,865
What's pissing you off?

100
00:17:31,139 --> 00:17:38,159
- I hope you have a big army behind you.
- My army is secret organization.

101
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:42,361
Everybody recognize it
and it attacks whenever it wants to.

102
00:17:44,825 --> 00:17:46,351
You are just bragging, you old babbler.

103
00:17:47,052 --> 00:17:49,283
- If you don't know how to socialize
  with older people, you shithead,

104
00:17:49,328 --> 00:17:50,883
  then i will have to teach you some manners.

105
00:17:50,884 --> 00:17:53,983
And what else would you like?

106
00:17:58,639 --> 00:18:00,913
Are you looking for this?

107
00:18:03,589 --> 00:18:07,364
That's what happens when you hug old people.

108
00:18:09,668 --> 00:18:14,056
- Where is you respect?
- Okay, calm down.

109
00:18:23,283 --> 00:18:26,276
Don't be afraid I'm not a sociopath.

110
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:31,632
- Yes.
- I see you're not dumb.

111
00:18:31,633 --> 00:18:34,410
I give you an advice,

112
00:18:34,411 --> 00:18:38,212
the kind you'll only get from a friend.

113
00:18:38,213 --> 00:18:44,201
In our bussiness you can't win.
At the end of your career if you lucky...

114
00:18:44,202 --> 00:18:45,943
you'll get this.

115
00:18:45,944 --> 00:18:50,178
If you get out of  water dry...
Are you following me?

116
00:18:51,428 --> 00:18:53,863
Thanks.

117
00:18:53,864 --> 00:18:56,275
I take your advice to my heart.

118
00:18:57,966 --> 00:19:01,598
If you really consider me as a friend,

119
00:19:01,599 --> 00:19:04,986
call me Jacques.

120
00:19:04,987 --> 00:19:07,973
Of course Jacques, sure.

121
00:19:19,975 --> 00:19:25,137
My Jacques. My lovely Jacques.

122
00:19:25,738 --> 00:19:27,953
Do you wanna do it again?

123
00:19:27,954 --> 00:19:32,776
I have a friend, but... if you'll pay me,
i'll work for you.

124
00:19:34,691 --> 00:19:37,516
Have you lost your mind?
What are you blabbing about?

125
00:19:37,517 --> 00:19:41,150
Who do you think i am?
Some sucker?

126
00:19:41,151 --> 00:19:45,715
I don't need your services.
I'll manage without you.

127
00:19:49,651 --> 00:19:52,154
Don't be so pissed.

128
00:19:54,373 --> 00:19:57,610
- I like you, Sarah
- I like you too.

129
00:19:57,611 --> 00:20:00,858
You must be careful how you talk to me.

130
00:20:03,253 --> 00:20:05,095
Hi.

131
00:20:09,110 --> 00:20:11,469
- Your boss called.
- What did he want?

132
00:20:11,470 --> 00:20:14,022
He said you didn't come to work for a week.

133
00:20:14,023 --> 00:20:15,895
- And what?
- What "what"?

134
00:20:15,896 --> 00:20:19,292
Father have found you a good job
and that's the way you pay him back?

135
00:20:19,293 --> 00:20:21,395
So what. What's your problem?

136
00:20:21,396 --> 00:20:24,102
Leave me alone!

137
00:20:24,103 --> 00:20:28,373
<i>Good man earns for his livelihood honestly!</i>

138
00:20:28,374 --> 00:20:32,467
<i>Keeps his family together and has a respect for them.</i>

139
00:20:37,014 --> 00:20:39,186
<i>Talk to your son!</i>

140
00:21:13,436 --> 00:21:17,698
You know, Me and your mom, we don't want you to leave.

141
00:21:17,699 --> 00:21:19,794
It's your house.

142
00:21:22,087 --> 00:21:26,525
Your mom, your mom...

143
00:21:26,526 --> 00:21:30,160
Speak for yourself for once.

144
00:21:30,161 --> 00:21:32,675
What's going on with you, Jacqui?

145
00:21:32,676 --> 00:21:36,865
Jacques is tired of his father being henpecked.

146
00:21:38,420 --> 00:21:42,831
And i am ashamed how you
collaborated with germans.

147
00:21:42,832 --> 00:21:49,787
And one more thing, tell me one reason
why i should be proud of my father.

148
00:21:49,788 --> 00:21:52,280
No, i didn't work for germans.

149
00:21:52,281 --> 00:21:56,288
- I was forced to.
- Nobody forced you, dad!

150
00:21:56,289 --> 00:21:59,283
The same way nobody forced me to go to Algeria!

151
00:21:59,284 --> 00:22:03,372
My god, just tell me what's going on with you.

152
00:22:03,373 --> 00:22:05,758
Do you have any pride?

153
00:22:16,111 --> 00:22:18,738
Spain, 1960.

154
00:22:30,016 --> 00:22:33,271
- It's nice here.
- I wouldn't lie to you.

155
00:22:33,272 --> 00:22:35,007
These two are coming to greet us.

156
00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:39,801
Excuse me.
How you doing?

157
00:22:39,802 --> 00:22:44,191

- Blond is mine.
- Ok, then i take brunette.

00:22:58,469 --> 00:22:59,877
Yeah, i do.

161
00:22:59,878 --> 00:23:03,140
- Paris, Paris... France.
- Eiffel tower. - Yeah.

162
00:23:03,141 --> 00:23:06,009
You know... Wait.

163
00:23:06,010 --> 00:23:09,519
Hey, Paul, how do you say kiss in spanish?

164
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:11,775
- Beso.
- Oh, kiss!

165
00:23:11,776 --> 00:23:12,776
A little beso...

166
00:23:12,777 --> 00:23:18,074
- I want you "beso".
- No, please.

167
00:23:30,983 --> 00:23:33,697

- No, no, no...

168
00:23:33,698 --> 00:23:37,741
Hey, man!

169

Hi.

171
00:23:48,176 --> 00:23:50,825
Would you like to dance?

172
00:23:50,826 --> 00:23:56,583
- In spanish you say  "bailar".
- Bailar? Great. So, would you like to "bailar"?

173
00:23:56,584 --> 00:23:58,832
No.

174
00:23:58,867 --> 00:24:01,051
Sofia, say yes.

175
00:24:02,002 --> 00:24:05,052
- Are you coming?
- Yes.

176
00:24:16,003 --> 00:24:20,126
- I'd like to dance, boy.
- Frenchmen don't dance.

177
00:25:45,283 --> 00:25:54,653
Come to my room, number 10.

178
00:25:54,654 --> 00:25:57,586
- No, no. - Why?
- No.

179
00:25:57,587 --> 00:25:59,487
- Really?
- Yes.

180
00:27:02,062 --> 00:27:04,492
I have never been with someone before.

181
00:27:07,555 --> 00:27:10,532
It's the first time.

182
00:27:10,533 --> 00:27:14,284
- First time?
- Yes.

183
00:27:14,285 --> 00:27:19,260
Sofia...

184
00:27:53,059 --> 00:27:55,918
Hey, Jacques!

185
00:27:55,919 --> 00:27:58,713
It's time, let's go!

186
00:28:00,989 --> 00:28:04,374
We got to go.
Move a bit faster.

187
00:28:20,751 --> 00:28:23,088
Get in.

188
00:28:24,468 --> 00:28:26,490
We're leaving.

189
00:28:31,114 --> 00:28:33,448
Bye!

190
00:28:38,651 --> 00:28:40,959
Bye!

191
00:28:41,371 --> 00:28:44,103
What can you do in weather like this?

192
00:28:44,104 --> 00:28:47,088
Weather is not bothering me,
I work where it doesn't matter.

193
00:28:50,296 --> 00:28:53,800
- What do you need the gun for?
- You don't carry the gun?

194
00:28:53,801 --> 00:28:59,683
- No, I don't. If you do anything can happen.
- Is it here? - Yeah.

195
00:29:07,805 --> 00:29:10,036
- Good evening!
- Good evening!

196
00:29:13,323 --> 00:29:17,843
- Do you want something to drink?
- Give me whiskey. - Double.

197
00:29:22,292 --> 00:29:25,504
- Is Sarah here?
- No, she's not but she'll be here soon.

198
00:29:26,646 --> 00:29:30,304
Sarah is taken, but Mado is free.

199
00:29:30,305 --> 00:29:32,469
Go!

200
00:29:32,470 --> 00:29:36,443
I wouldn't take this one.

201
00:29:36,444 --> 00:29:39,576
- Gentlemen, would you buy a lady a drink?
- Get lost!

202
00:29:39,577 --> 00:29:43,123
- What if you'd show some respect for the lady?
- Beat it! Get lost!

203
00:29:43,124 --> 00:29:48,521
What's that about?
Are you serving faggots in your bar?

204
00:29:48,822 --> 00:29:50,022
I told you to get lost!

205
00:29:53,244 --> 00:29:54,856
Hey, you!

206
00:29:54,857 --> 00:29:57,831
What kind of manners are these?

207
00:29:59,497 --> 00:30:02,651
What's wrong?
Anyone else wants some too? Huh?

208
00:30:07,368 --> 00:30:10,696
Jacques, What are you doing here?

209
00:30:10,697 --> 00:30:13,081
Leave him alone!

210
00:30:13,082 --> 00:30:17,342
- My poor boy. - What are you doing?
- Have you lost your mind?

211
00:30:18,719 --> 00:30:23,404
- Are selling yourself because of him?
  Yeah. And you got a problem with it? He's my friend, ok?

212
00:30:24,488 --> 00:30:27,616
You snake! Get out of here!
I didn't ask you for anything!

213
00:30:27,617 --> 00:30:31,271
- My love.
- My nose...

214
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:36,188
- I'm so sorry.
- Sweet couple.

215
00:30:36,992 --> 00:30:38,880
Get out of here!

216
00:30:41,494 --> 00:30:42,912
Get out!

217
00:30:57,211 --> 00:30:59,700
I'm sorry, Sarah.

218
00:31:12,526 --> 00:31:15,799
God!

219
00:31:45,318 --> 00:31:47,191
Sit in back.

220
00:32:13,097 --> 00:32:15,217
Your nose got bigger.

221
00:32:16,892 --> 00:32:22,219
It's nothing.
And how's Sarah, is she alive?

222
00:32:26,159 --> 00:32:32,205
Listen Jacques, i've made an agreement with Guido.
I let you have her.

223
00:32:35,183 --> 00:32:40,108
I fixed her smile a little bit .

224
00:32:48,349 --> 00:32:55,044
Ahmed, that's nice suit.

225
00:32:55,045 --> 00:32:58,737
- It's a classic. Isn't it Guido?
- A classic suit.

226
00:32:58,738 --> 00:33:03,495
- Is excellent. - Oh, yeah.
- I look in it like a real frenchman.

227
00:33:05,490 --> 00:33:07,970
Frenchman?

228
00:33:10,807 --> 00:33:14,067
You know how they call an Arab in suit like this?

229
00:33:15,041 --> 00:33:18,278
- Do you know it, Guido?
- No, I don't know.

230
00:33:18,279 --> 00:33:22,380
They say, "defendant , stand up!"

231
00:33:29,721 --> 00:33:31,901
good joke.

232
00:33:31,902 --> 00:33:36,607
Jacques, do you know what they call Arab in ashtray?

233
00:33:36,608 --> 00:33:38,575
No.

234
00:33:38,576 --> 00:33:41,440
A wastefulness. Three of them would fit in it.

235
00:33:54,985 --> 00:33:57,008
Good joke.

236
00:33:57,009 --> 00:34:02,052
- We're just joking.
- Don't be afraid.

237
00:34:03,716 --> 00:34:07,033
- We are not like that.
- No, we are not.

238
00:34:41,884 --> 00:34:45,725
You son of bitch.
I spit on people like you!

239
00:34:45,726 --> 00:34:51,140
Guido,  i gave you a word of a man.
I promised you!

240
00:34:51,141 --> 00:34:54,237
- Your arab word is worth a shit!
- Shut up!

241
00:34:54,238 --> 00:34:57,708
Shut up!

242
00:34:57,709 --> 00:35:04,036
- Come here so i can see you better.
- Look, he whiffs like girl. - Shut your hole!

243
00:35:07,308 --> 00:35:13,581
I would put bullet in a man's head,
but an animal like you, i finish off with knife!

244
00:35:14,792 --> 00:35:19,758
Did you want to sell Sarah!
For how much?

245
00:35:42,231 --> 00:35:44,844
Die you asshole!

246
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:50,289
Well, what you got?
Flesh.

247
00:36:50,290 --> 00:36:54,030
- What's that?
- That's not important.

248
00:36:54,031 --> 00:36:57,713
- Jacques, did you get married?
- Yes, I did.

249
00:36:58,131 --> 00:37:00,013
- Are you married?
- I am.

250
00:37:00,014 --> 00:37:04,171
Heard that, Guido?
He got married.

251
00:37:04,172 --> 00:37:10,616
- She's pregnant.
- He got married because she is pregnant. Bravo.

252
00:37:12,705 --> 00:37:16,003
Enough.

253
00:37:16,004 --> 00:37:20,022
Hey, are you gonna serve me finally?
Pour drinks! Bitch!

254
00:37:20,023 --> 00:37:24,134
Move your ass! What are you doing?
Pour drinks!

255
00:37:24,135 --> 00:37:27,811
Hey, guys, what's the problem?

256
00:37:28,958 --> 00:37:31,852
And who are you?
Son of this bitch or the owner?

257
00:37:31,853 --> 00:37:34,277
Please, serve them.

258
00:37:35,716 --> 00:37:38,812
move your ass!

259
00:37:40,854 --> 00:37:43,102
Well, you see.

260
00:37:56,210 --> 00:37:59,609
Nothing's happening. Keep playing.
Everything is okay.

261
00:38:02,181 --> 00:38:07,121
This for disrespect
and this for your drinks.

262
00:38:12,946 --> 00:38:16,370
- Does it always take so long?
- Depends.

263
00:38:16,371 --> 00:38:19,880
- 8-10 hours, depends.
- That long?

264
00:38:19,881 --> 00:38:22,288
Depends, maybe even longer.

265
00:38:38,477 --> 00:38:42,060
- When you become father, maybe you'll settle down. 
- Maybe.

266
00:38:42,061 --> 00:38:45,823
Lot of things change with time but me.

267
00:38:45,824 --> 00:38:48,826
- Only a few people change.
- It's true.

268
00:38:48,827 --> 00:38:54,044
- Do you remember Skazatov?  - Who is he?
- You shot him in his knees, that guy.

269
00:38:54,045 --> 00:38:57,520
Oh, Skazatov, i remember.

270
00:38:59,379 --> 00:39:02,223
And what about him?

271
00:39:02,224 --> 00:39:07,910
A couple days ago he came with two buddies and was asking about you.

272
00:39:07,911 --> 00:39:11,278
Were they tough guys?

273
00:39:12,634 --> 00:39:15,701
Yes they were.

274
00:39:15,702 --> 00:39:21,362
But without my approval they won't do anything to you.

275
00:39:21,363 --> 00:39:27,564
Really? So it's cool.

276
00:39:31,261 --> 00:39:33,629
What are they doing over there?

277
00:39:34,597 --> 00:39:37,159
A child.

278
00:39:39,510 --> 00:39:43,461
- Mister Mesrine?
- It's me. Guido, finally.

279
00:39:45,607 --> 00:39:47,908
You have a beautiful daughter.

280
00:39:50,553 --> 00:39:52,781
You the man.

281
00:39:52,782 --> 00:39:56,159
- How are you?
- She's beautiful.

282
00:40:06,604 --> 00:40:09,180
Hi.

283
00:40:23,712 --> 00:40:25,238
What happened?

284
00:40:27,516 --> 00:40:33,506
- Were you out with buddies and whores?
- Yeah, you're right.

285
00:40:35,339 --> 00:40:37,058
Wait.

286
00:40:38,650 --> 00:40:42,908
Let me finish it.
Yeah, i was with my buddies.

287
00:40:42,909 --> 00:40:46,876
- How about whores?
- Whores?

288
00:40:46,877 --> 00:40:47,877
Whores.

289
00:40:50,021 --> 00:40:52,951
why would i need whores when i have a woman like you?

290
00:41:18,022 --> 00:41:23,156
That bank looks great. Only two tellers work there,
but most importantly there's no safe.

291
00:41:23,157 --> 00:41:26,465
These morons keep money
under regular lock.

292
00:41:26,466 --> 00:41:29,517
Jacques, it's a walk in the park.

293
00:41:29,518 --> 00:41:32,639
- And you don't want to do it?
- No.

294
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:35,019
- Why?
- Because i'm going with Guido.

295
00:41:35,020 --> 00:41:40,233
- I don't have any choice and you know that.
- That bank can be easily robbed.

296
00:41:40,234 --> 00:41:42,997
Get in, get out, the same way bunnies fuck.

297
00:41:44,564 --> 00:41:48,670
- Yeah, as long as bunnies won't get fucked by someone else.
- Yeah.

298
00:41:53,337 --> 00:41:57,211
To bunnies!
I do it!

299
00:41:58,323 --> 00:42:02,403
<i>Prison d´Evreux, 1962.</i>

300
00:42:57,999 --> 00:43:01,538
- How are you?
- Dad.

301
00:43:01,539 --> 00:43:04,815
Did she say "dad"?

302
00:43:06,343 --> 00:43:10,656
My little girl. Dad.

303
00:43:10,657 --> 00:43:16,426
She said it.
I'm dad.

304
00:43:16,427 --> 00:43:19,103
Your daddy.

305
00:43:19,104 --> 00:43:22,287
She said it for the first time.

306
00:43:25,041 --> 00:43:27,582
Jacques...

307
00:43:27,583 --> 00:43:31,593
I don't know what to do.

308
00:43:31,594 --> 00:43:37,805
- What do you mean?
- I phoned your parents and they said...

309
00:43:39,710 --> 00:43:42,924
i should go back to Spain.

310
00:43:42,925 --> 00:43:46,249
What kinda crap is this? Is this why you came here?

311
00:43:46,250 --> 00:43:49,250
To look at me and tell me you're taking my daughter away from me?

312
00:43:51,911 --> 00:43:58,351
Sofia, look at me.

313
00:43:58,352 --> 00:44:01,789
Do you want to tell me that?

314
00:44:04,677 --> 00:44:09,134
I love you...

315
00:44:11,423 --> 00:44:13,413
...you're my wife.

316
00:44:13,414 --> 00:44:16,600
I need you a lot.

317
00:44:16,601 --> 00:44:20,705
Phone my parents,
they'll help you out. Sofia...

318
00:44:22,026 --> 00:44:24,458
For them you're like their own daughter.

319
00:44:26,253 --> 00:44:29,336
- Will you phone them?
- Yes, I will.

320
00:44:33,473 --> 00:44:37,155
This is my mom. Mom.

321
00:44:37,156 --> 00:44:40,225
She's a beauty your mom.

322
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:53,463
I just got out of jail. I'm not ashamed to say
 i was there for robberies.

323
00:44:55,130 --> 00:44:57,409
And the reason I don't have any references 
it's simply because...

324
00:44:57,410 --> 00:45:00,400
my life was on the edge since i came back from army.

325
00:45:00,410 --> 00:45:04,298
And right here I'd like to  start fresh from zero.

326
00:45:06,001 --> 00:45:11,422
I'm doing this because of my parents, my wife
and of course for myself.

327
00:45:11,623 --> 00:45:13,770
But most importantly for little daughter because...

328
00:45:13,771 --> 00:45:15,571
... i have a little a daughter.

329
00:45:16,671 --> 00:45:20,949
You know, your past is not helping you.

330
00:45:20,950 --> 00:45:25,381
But at the same time i feel your honesty.

331
00:45:27,146 --> 00:45:30,976
You can start work tomorrow.

332
00:45:30,977 --> 00:45:35,017
- Really?
  Yes.  - Thank you.

333
00:45:35,018 --> 00:45:37,605
- I'll show you where you'll work.
- Sure.

334
00:45:37,606 --> 00:45:40,805
This way, please.

335
00:45:40,806 --> 00:45:44,041
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

336
00:45:45,674 --> 00:45:49,128
Jacques, your little Bruno is a cutie.
Doesn't he cry during the night?

337
00:45:49,129 --> 00:45:53,214
Only rarely, but that's pretty normal.

338
00:45:53,215 --> 00:45:56,867
- Does he cry?
  No. - You're sweet.

339
00:45:56,868 --> 00:46:02,405
- Just wait when his teeth start coming out...
- Anyway, we'll see.

340
00:46:02,406 --> 00:46:07,231
- I adore kus-kus.
- You know what, you should open a restaurant.

341
00:46:07,232 --> 00:46:11,580
- You're good cook.
- Besides, he already has a job with a good pay.

342
00:46:11,581 --> 00:46:15,856
- We don't miss anything.
- Don't get excited.

343
00:46:15,857 --> 00:46:19,749
Sofia, come to me, honey.

344
00:46:23,748 --> 00:46:26,495
- Good night.
  Good night.  - Bye, bye.

345
00:46:29,115 --> 00:46:37,520
I have a job for you.
You wanna make some money?

346
00:46:37,521 --> 00:46:39,840
No, i don't.

347
00:46:39,841 --> 00:46:42,666
- No?
- No, i don't want to.

348
00:46:42,667 --> 00:46:47,219
Because of Sabrine and Bruno.
I live and support myself honestly.

349
00:46:47,220 --> 00:46:51,591
Alright we'll discuss it any other time.

350
00:46:53,106 --> 00:46:55,359
Let me know.

351
00:47:01,501 --> 00:47:03,951
- Jacques, you got a minute?
- Yeah, i do.

352
00:47:03,952 --> 00:47:09,436
- I have serious problems.
- Like what?

353
00:47:09,437 --> 00:47:12,228
I'll have to fire somebody.

354
00:47:12,229 --> 00:47:15,859
- But above all...
- I get it.

355
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:19,136
- Wait...
- It's alright.

356
00:47:19,137 --> 00:47:23,825
- Last one to come, first one to go.
- I haven't decided yet.

357
00:47:23,826 --> 00:47:29,153
- Don't make anything out of it, you're good man.
- Don't worry because of me.

358
00:47:37,042 --> 00:47:41,060
- So, i'm ready.
  Let's go.   - Jacques?

359
00:47:43,061 --> 00:47:45,445
- Jacques, where are you going?
- Everything's ok. I'm going out with my buddies.

360
00:47:45,446 --> 00:47:49,348
What buddies?
You said you're done with it.

361
00:47:49,349 --> 00:47:53,610
- Listen to me! 
- You listen to me! I don't have time for this now.

362
00:47:53,611 --> 00:47:56,417
- You promised me that you won't hang out with them anymore. 
- That's history.

363
00:47:56,418 --> 00:47:59,352
Go back to them and
that whore too!

364
00:47:59,353 --> 00:48:02,282
- And what's bothering you?
- Why can't you just stay home?

365
00:48:02,283 --> 00:48:05,159
This is the home of my parents!
I lost my job!

366
00:48:05,160 --> 00:48:09,402
- I don't care whose home is it!
- Quiet! You wake up Bruno!

367
00:48:09,403 --> 00:48:12,635
If you leave, I'll call cops!

368
00:48:17,456 --> 00:48:20,474
What did you say?

369
00:48:20,475 --> 00:48:23,348
Say it again! Repeat what you just said!

370
00:48:24,645 --> 00:48:28,540
Don't you ever say these words again, ok?

371
00:48:34,980 --> 00:48:40,760
- Come here! Open the mouth!
- So, kill me!  - Open your mouth!

372
00:48:46,762 --> 00:48:53,101
If i should choose between my 
buddies and you, i'd choose them.

373
00:48:53,102 --> 00:48:55,842
Remember that.

374
00:48:55,843 --> 00:48:58,551
Mom!

375
00:49:03,912 --> 00:49:07,097
Take care of daughter.

376
00:49:15,582 --> 00:49:20,662
Fat Guido.
You think i can't recognize you through the mask?

377
00:49:24,852 --> 00:49:27,775
You're ridiculous.

378
00:49:27,776 --> 00:49:31,035
- Yeah, sure.
- The guy you're getting these papers for...

379
00:49:31,336 --> 00:49:32,836
is already dead.

380
00:49:33,036 --> 00:49:36,434
- You asshole.
  Looser. - Shut up!

381
00:49:36,435 --> 00:49:38,604
Who sent you?

382
00:49:38,605 --> 00:49:41,115
- Chevallier?
- Shut up!

383
00:49:41,116 --> 00:49:43,317
This is your end.
You're finished.

384
00:49:43,318 --> 00:49:45,878
You've reached your goal.

385
00:49:47,277 --> 00:49:49,617
I found them.

386
00:49:54,895 --> 00:49:59,173
- Why did you do it?
  Mind your own shit. Any other questions?

387
00:49:59,174 --> 00:50:03,394
- You killed unarmed man!
- Do you recall how you put the gun in your wife's mouth.

388
00:50:03,395 --> 00:50:05,383
That's something different.

389
00:50:07,026 --> 00:50:09,154
I break.

390
00:50:11,416 --> 00:50:15,916
- Do you bet more or you wanna take a break?
- Time, time, time...

391
00:50:17,938 --> 00:50:21,728
You don't need me to give you an advice.
You'll figure it out yourself.

392
00:50:32,530 --> 00:50:35,861
- Here!
- Why are you throwing away your wedding ring?

393
00:50:35,862 --> 00:50:39,549
- She has abandoned us. Me and three kids.
- What?

394
00:50:39,550 --> 00:50:41,736
Yeah.

395
00:50:43,809 --> 00:50:46,928
- Really?
  Yeah.   - Good.

396
00:50:46,929 --> 00:50:51,258
You think this is more than three?

397
00:50:51,259 --> 00:50:53,947
Doesn't matter. Fuck Sofia.

398
00:50:55,565 --> 00:51:03,388
So, Who is the best?
Your friend Paul won everything.

399
00:51:30,942 --> 00:51:34,339

400
00:51:43,527 --> 00:51:48,602
- Handsome, are you gonna buy me a drink?
  He can't, he's here with me.

401
00:51:50,062 --> 00:51:52,003
okay then.

402
00:52:05,965 --> 00:52:07,909
Thanks.

403
00:52:09,057 --> 00:52:12,711
- What's your name?
- Jeanne.

404
00:52:12,712 --> 00:52:17,150
Jeanne? Funny.
And I am Tarzan.

405
00:52:21,577 --> 00:52:26,896
- My real name is Jacques.
- My pleasure Jacques.

406
00:52:26,897 --> 00:52:31,838
- What do you want to drink?
- I thought it's customary for a gentleman to ask this question.

407
00:52:31,839 --> 00:52:34,686
Traditions need to be changed.

408
00:52:34,687 --> 00:52:39,186
- I try. I'm ready for everything.
- Me too.

409
00:52:40,790 --> 00:52:42,918
Really?

410
00:52:42,919 --> 00:52:45,306
Yes.

411
00:52:49,225 --> 00:52:52,266
- Quiet! Nobody moves!
- Everybody put your hands on the table!

412
00:52:52,267 --> 00:52:56,821
- Quickly, all of you hands on the table!
- I said, hands on the table!

413
00:52:56,822 --> 00:53:00,124
Hey, calm her down!

414
00:53:00,125 --> 00:53:03,995
Move, hurry, hurry!

415
00:53:05,713 --> 00:53:07,787
What's your problem?!

416
00:53:11,203 --> 00:53:13,357
- I said, quiet!
- Quiet!

417
00:53:14,566 --> 00:53:16,534
- Quick, move!
- Jacques...

418
00:53:17,806 --> 00:53:20,212
- now you're stealing from me?
  Do you have a problem with it?

419
00:53:20,213 --> 00:53:26,115
- You won't get too far.
- Don't worry about me.

420
00:53:27,333 --> 00:53:29,455
I have what i want.

421
00:53:30,852 --> 00:53:33,688
Here is a tip.

422
00:53:41,910 --> 00:53:45,169
- Dad, why isn't it working?
  Sweetie,

423
00:53:45,170 --> 00:53:49,132
because the ball and the racket must be this way.

424
00:54:05,068 --> 00:54:09,263
- Are you alright?
 Dad, does it hurt? - No, it's nothing, honey.

425
00:54:09,264 --> 00:54:11,941
I'm only injured.

426
00:54:12,264 --> 00:54:14,741
- I love you dad.
- I love you too.

427
00:54:23,870 --> 00:54:27,002
In front of my daughter!
What the hell is it!

428
00:54:27,525 --> 00:54:31,145
Will you stay together? Do you still want 
to be with him?

429
00:54:31,146 --> 00:54:34,314
- To the end.
  Yes, of course.

430
00:54:35,240 --> 00:54:40,705
If you love this woman, run away with her
and come back when everything settles down.

431
00:54:40,706 --> 00:54:43,379
Do you really mean it?

432
00:54:43,380 --> 00:54:46,835
You think they won't go after us once we cross the border?

433
00:54:46,836 --> 00:54:51,730
The police is trying to get you,
i won't help you with that.

434
00:54:51,731 --> 00:54:55,053
Yeah, but they were shooting at my daughter!
I guess there are some rules!

435
00:54:55,054 --> 00:55:00,839
What rules?! In this bussiness
there's only one rule, rule of the jungle.

436
00:55:00,840 --> 00:55:03,743
Everything has principles and moral laws.

437
00:55:03,744 --> 00:55:07,546
Get ready.
It will hurt.

438
00:55:18,882 --> 00:55:21,318
Don't twist, I almost had her.

439
00:55:23,401 --> 00:55:25,121
Guido!

440
00:55:28,281 --> 00:55:32,043
 Remember in the future,
this is being used for killing people!

441
00:55:33,906 --> 00:55:35,814
Good.

442
00:55:51,276 --> 00:55:53,521
Let me, i'll help you out.

443
00:55:53,522 --> 00:55:56,455
Bye mom.

444
00:55:56,456 --> 00:56:01,021
- Come to me.
- Bye dad.

445
00:56:02,422 --> 00:56:05,893
- My love.
- Be back soon.

446
00:56:47,847 --> 00:56:50,776
<i>Montreal, 1968.</i>

447
00:57:00,566 --> 00:57:02,561
More, more, more!

448
00:57:04,577 --> 00:57:06,663
Good!

449
00:57:43,050 --> 00:57:45,546
You're doing pretty good for a Frenchman.

450
00:57:45,547 --> 00:57:48,784
It seems you are not from around here.

451
00:57:48,785 --> 00:57:51,623
How long have you been here?

452
00:57:52,939 --> 00:57:54,403
A month or two.

453
00:57:55,418 --> 00:57:57,660
Do you like this job?

454
00:57:58,984 --> 00:58:02,365
I was doing better back in France.

455
00:58:02,366 --> 00:58:04,533
What was your job?

456
00:58:12,909 --> 00:58:15,994
I was robbing banks.
My name is Jacques Mesrine.

457
00:58:15,995 --> 00:58:18,551
And yours?

458
00:58:18,552 --> 00:58:21,355
Jean-Paul Mercier.

459
00:58:21,356 --> 00:58:24,126
I'm helping to finance a thieves.

460
00:58:25,332 --> 00:58:28,066
Pefect job in Quebec.

461
00:58:28,067 --> 00:58:33,035
- Pleased to meet you.
- You too.

462
00:58:37,923 --> 00:58:44,267
Because of your criminal past I have to deny 
your residence application.

463
00:58:44,268 --> 00:58:48,480
You have 10 days to leave Canadian territory.

464
00:59:04,161 --> 00:59:05,811
Dear.

465
00:59:05,812 --> 00:59:08,148
How did it go at the immigration?

466
00:59:10,011 --> 00:59:14,369
Good, but we need more time.

467
00:59:14,370 --> 00:59:19,217
Next week you don't have to go back to construction job.

468
00:59:19,218 --> 00:59:22,742
- Why?
- I replied  to an ad from some millionaire.

469
00:59:22,743 --> 00:59:25,743
He's looking for a driver.
We'll go for an interview.

470
00:59:27,392 --> 00:59:31,101
- Will you be working for him too?
  Yes, I always want to be with you.

471
00:59:53,923 --> 00:59:57,336
Mr. Davallier. Mrs. Schneider
and Mr. Mesríne are here.

472
00:59:57,337 --> 00:59:59,328
Come in, please.

473
01:00:02,806 --> 01:00:08,288
- Welcome.
- So it's you, Jacques and Jeanne.

474
01:00:08,289 --> 01:00:11,044
My guardian angels.

475
01:00:12,459 --> 01:00:18,301
- I suppose that we are hired.
- And you have my blessing too, my son.

476
01:00:18,302 --> 01:00:23,243
So in that case, thanks dad.

477
01:00:39,282 --> 01:00:42,259
Let's go
one, two and three.

478
01:00:43,723 --> 01:00:45,197
Are you alright?

479
01:00:45,198 --> 01:00:47,509
Slowly.

480
01:00:47,510 --> 01:00:49,834
We are not in a hurry.

481
01:00:51,108 --> 01:00:53,771
Don't worry, i'm holding you.

482
01:00:55,826 --> 01:00:57,563
So where to, sir?

483
01:00:57,564 --> 01:01:00,438
- to Santlar street.
- Sure.

484
01:01:13,199 --> 01:01:16,634


485
01:01:18,162 --> 01:01:20,074
Hello sir.

486
01:01:21,200 --> 01:01:25,917
- Have you paid for the parking?
- I live here, here is my card.
- Good then, take care.

487
01:01:44,964 --> 01:01:46,215
Look.

488
01:01:46,216 --> 01:01:49,554
- This is from Jacques.
- From Jacques?

489
01:02:26,201 --> 01:02:29,517
I'm telling you for the first and  the last time,
stop mingling in to my work.

490
01:02:29,518 --> 01:02:32,848
- I don't want to see you here anymore!
- What? Are you going to complain?

491
01:02:32,928 --> 01:02:34,848
I've been working here for more than 20 years!

492
01:02:34,849 --> 01:02:37,511
Just go!

493
01:02:37,512 --> 01:02:41,695
- You'll see, you won't get out of this that easily!
- Go, just go!

494
01:02:42,324 --> 01:02:44,545
That's okay.

495
01:02:55,386 --> 01:02:58,314
My gardener gave me a notice.

496
01:02:58,315 --> 01:03:04,442
You talked to him with disrespect.
The whole altercation was provoked by you.

497
01:03:04,443 --> 01:03:07,298
- That guy is just a nobody.
- Maybe he is,

498
01:03:07,299 --> 01:03:11,641
but he served me loyally for 20 years.

499
01:03:11,642 --> 01:03:14,585
And I only knew you for three months,

500
01:03:14,586 --> 01:03:19,124
so with less regret i rather say goodbye to you.

501
01:03:19,125 --> 01:03:23,483
- I'm giving two days to leave this house.
- Sure. Come, we're leaving.

502
01:04:05,072 --> 01:04:08,139
<i>Jacques, we have to talk!</i>

503
01:04:13,198 --> 01:04:15,371
<i>Jacques!</i>

504
01:04:17,205 --> 01:04:19,873
<i>- Jacquesi!</i>
- Damn! 

505
01:04:22,195 --> 01:04:23,879
What?! What!

506
01:04:26,131 --> 01:04:31,309
- Why are you treating me like this?
  For disrespecting me, Georges.

507
01:04:31,310 --> 01:04:35,068
- and for disrespecting my wife.
- Tell me...

508
01:04:36,354 --> 01:04:38,295
what do you intend to do with me?

509
01:04:38,296 --> 01:04:43,169
- Jacques?!
- What? At first, you've been so nice to us,

510
01:04:43,170 --> 01:04:47,230
and then because of that idiot gardener,
you fired us!

511
01:04:47,231 --> 01:04:49,626
Are we some kind of scum?

512
01:04:50,786 --> 01:04:55,150
You'll pay for this.
I'll teach you some respect!

513
01:04:55,151 --> 01:04:58,416
- My brother will pay you.
- It's possible.

514
01:04:59,310 --> 01:05:03,363
In the meanwhile let me watch the TV!

515
01:05:47,574 --> 01:05:51,251
Jacques!

516
01:06:27,355 --> 01:06:29,122
Help!

517
01:06:33,454 --> 01:06:37,065
- Hi  Jacques. This is Jean-Paul.
- What's up? 
- I don't think he'll come.

518
01:06:37,066 --> 01:06:40,390
We'll see about that.
I'm done talking!

519
01:06:46,125 --> 01:06:48,889
He thinks, he is gonna pull my leg.

520
01:06:48,890 --> 01:06:52,909
That old fart didn't show up with the money!
He'll pay, you'll see Jeanne.

521
01:07:24,440 --> 01:07:26,171
That's him.

522
01:07:32,736 --> 01:07:34,715
Shit!

523
01:07:50,850 --> 01:07:53,648

524
01:08:33,927 --> 01:08:36,643
- What are we going to do, Jacques?  Look. 
- Shit!

525
01:08:39,689 --> 01:08:42,228
I have to stop.

526
01:08:43,001 --> 01:08:45,020
Fine, stop.

527
01:08:45,021 --> 01:08:48,100
Get ready!

528
01:08:49,665 --> 01:08:52,669

01:09:04,214 --> 01:09:07,014

532
01:09:07,015 --> 01:09:09,675
 No. It's too many of them.

533
01:09:09,676 --> 01:09:12,537

534
01:09:12,538 --> 01:09:16,132

- Quebec? A very restricting country.

I don't give a shit what i can't do.
I'm Jacques Mesrine. Stop pissing me off!

Forget about it, Frenchman.

561
01:17:22,453 --> 01:17:25,711
I've seen you on TV.

562
01:17:27,097 --> 01:17:29,898
Long live Quebec, right?

563
01:17:32,290 --> 01:17:35,252
You think you can get through barb wire?

564
01:17:38,498 --> 01:17:43,544
Your friend Mercier is right there
where you've been tortured by Gottier.

565
01:17:47,562 --> 01:17:51,508
- How is he?
- How could he be, he's barely alive.

566
01:17:55,510 --> 01:17:59,541
See you soon, French.

567
01:17:59,576 --> 01:18:02,671
By the way, you looked more happier on TV.

568
01:19:12,219 --> 01:19:14,578
Hey!

569
01:19:17,438 --> 01:19:20,119
- Nice to see you again.
- You too.

570
01:19:21,959 --> 01:19:24,622
Hey, hold on.
They're watching.

571
01:19:43,463 --> 01:19:46,561
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

572
01:19:49,597 --> 01:19:52,057
Do you know these two?

573
01:19:52,058 --> 01:19:55,556
- Which ones?
- The fat one with buddy.

574
01:19:57,136 --> 01:20:00,643
That fat one is murderer.

575
01:20:00,644 --> 01:20:05,442
The other one, too.
He's suspected of killing the guard.

576
01:20:08,604 --> 01:20:10,268
Why? Are they causing problems for you?

577
01:20:11,804 --> 01:20:13,800
Right now, i don't know.

578
01:20:15,252 --> 01:20:19,351
I think I know how we'll escape from here.

579
01:20:19,352 --> 01:20:22,299
We'll get through the fence.

580
01:20:22,300 --> 01:20:25,442
During our walk in daylight?

581
01:20:27,651 --> 01:20:29,819
Do you have any other ideas?

582
01:20:29,820 --> 01:20:34,378
Good, Jacques. 
When?

583
01:20:36,971 --> 01:20:40,246
By the fall you'll be either outside or
 you'll be dead.

584
01:20:41,746 --> 01:20:45,357
I'm for it. Death or freedom.

585
01:21:19,818 --> 01:21:22,981
Tell me honestly.
What do you want from me, Frenchman?

586
01:21:22,982 --> 01:21:29,220
- I need tools.
- What's in it for me?

587
01:21:30,652 --> 01:21:33,179
I don't have anything to offer you.

588
01:21:33,180 --> 01:21:35,811
Except a chance for freedom.

589
01:21:35,812 --> 01:21:39,938
If i'll manage to get out of here,
i'll take you with me. I'm giving you my word.

590
01:21:41,130 --> 01:21:44,051
You're desparate, Frenchman.
I like it.

591
01:21:45,657 --> 01:21:48,487
- Let's go.
- See you.

592
01:21:49,906 --> 01:21:52,403
Did he agree?

593
01:21:53,670 --> 01:21:56,462
- What day is today?
- I know is monday.

594
01:22:06,497 --> 01:22:09,826
Jesus, Frenchman!
Do you want to get killed?!

595
01:22:14,179 --> 01:22:17,973
But not here and not on monday.

596
01:22:25,945 --> 01:22:29,857
They are always watching,
except on monday after weekend hangover.

597
01:24:28,844 --> 01:24:30,697
Mercier, let's go.

598
01:25:13,457 --> 01:25:15,782
- Are you looking out?
- Yeah.

599
01:25:40,181 --> 01:25:41,755
Hurry!

600
01:26:19,821 --> 01:26:21,498
Don't worry, everything is ok.

601
01:26:27,002 --> 01:26:29,468
Stop! Or i'll shoot!

602
01:27:08,838 --> 01:27:10,310
Come on, let's get out of here!

603
01:27:36,623 --> 01:27:39,157
Everybody on the ground!
Face to the ground!

605
01:28:03,289 --> 01:28:07,921
<i>Until now this was considered impossible.</i>

- Jean-Paul!
- What?

607
01:28:10,824 --> 01:28:13,751
- They talk about us.
- Leave me alone right now!

608
01:28:36,317 --> 01:28:39,109
- Jean-Paul!
  Give me two minutes, damn!

609
01:28:42,026 --> 01:28:43,924
We're famous, Jean-Paul.

610
01:28:53,824 --> 01:28:57,418
Don't go out with your hands up
only if they'll capture both of us.

611
01:28:57,419 --> 01:28:59,687
They shoot at everybody, whoever moves.

612
01:29:01,677 --> 01:29:04,881
- We must be fast.
  How much time do we have?

613
01:29:04,882 --> 01:29:06,982
30 seconds.

614
01:29:08,945 --> 01:29:10,767
Not enough?

615
01:29:13,746 --> 01:29:15,486
- Do we have a choice?
- No.

616
01:29:27,278 --> 01:29:29,501
I wanna see your hands!

617
01:29:29,502 --> 01:29:32,331
Quick on the floor!

618
01:29:32,332 --> 01:29:35,706
Don't move!

619
01:29:37,145 --> 01:29:39,884
Quiet!

620
01:29:39,885 --> 01:29:43,645
I said don't move!

621
01:29:43,646 --> 01:29:46,255
Don't move and nothing happens to you!

622
01:29:47,928 --> 01:29:51,306
I'm telling you, don't move!

623
01:29:52,701 --> 01:29:54,652

624
01:29:54,653 --> 01:30:00,329

626
01:30:11,804 --> 01:30:15,850
Thank you ladies and gentlemen.
Take care. Stay nicely on the floor.

627
01:30:21,451 --> 01:30:24,337
No, not yet. That one across the street too.

628
01:30:24,338 --> 01:30:26,406
- What?
  Let's go!

629
01:30:26,407 --> 01:30:28,207
You're crazy!

630
01:30:55,336 --> 01:30:57,498

631
01:30:58,681 --> 01:31:00,110
It's time.

632
01:31:20,914 --> 01:31:22,495
I'll be back soon!

Yeah.

- two, three!

639
01:33:45,356 --> 01:33:47,195
Shit!

641
01:34:07,658 --> 01:34:10,226

- Ok.

Everything is fine.
Not bad. It's ok.

659
01:37:37,145 --> 01:37:42,548
No, nothing is fine.
As soon as i'll get better,

- No, don't organize anything.
  What's going on with you, honey? Stop.

662

Mercier is with me.
We're armed to the teeth.

No, please don't do it.
Soon my jail time will be over.

Hush, what are you talking about?

666
01:38:05,128 --> 01:38:09,432
I'll come to get you, my love.
We'll leave together and everything will stay behind us.

667
01:38:10,907 --> 01:38:14,788
Don't do it, Jacques.
I don't want you to come.

668
01:38:14,789 --> 01:38:18,200
- I'm asking you, please understand.
- I'll come to get you!

- No, they know you'll come.

They won't kill me, trust me.

Jacques, you must not come.

674

I said i'll come and i really will do it, damn!

  No, Jacques...

My hand is still weak.
