00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:08,330
<i>Los Phantomas.</i>

2
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:32,841
Oh!

3
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:19,771
Juan?

4
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:22,931
Luis?

5
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:26,285
Pablo!

6
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:42,046
Oh...

7
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:44,487
No, no, no, please!

8
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:46,250
No, no, no!

9
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,656
Look, there's money. Look at
all the drugs around you, man.

10
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:51,251
<i>We could do business. We'll get you rich!</i>

11
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,444
What are you doing? No.

12
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:59,728
Stop doing that. No, what are you...

13
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:10,130
No, no. Look, you got
all this money around, man.

14
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:12,248
No, no...

15
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,561
He's my kitten, Iglesias.

16
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:17,961
<i>Please, please.
No, don't hurt him. Please.</i>

17
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:22,286
No, no, no.

18
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:24,807
<i>That's my baby, Iglesias. No, no.</i>

19
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:28,803
<i>He's a kitten, you know.</i>

20
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,564
Everybody likes baby kittens.

21
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:31,801
<i>Right?</i>

22
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:33,962
You know, it's not so bad, yeah.

23
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:40,816
Please, no. Look, I'll go away.
I'll go away, please!

24
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:42,683
<i>Please, no!</i>

25
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,201
Freeze! Police!

26
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:53,486
Drop your weapon now!

27
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:55,324
<i>Show me your hands now!</i>

28
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:57,642
<i>On the ground. Get on the ground!</i>

29
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:58,841
<i>Get on the ground now!</i>

30
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:50,202
<i>Ca“ Re“.</i>

31
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:52,328
Calling Rell-

32
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,086
Hey, cuz!

33
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:06,408
Oh, my gosh. You're alive, man.

34
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,449
<i>How are you? How you doing?</i>

35
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:10,728
Nothing makes sense anymore.

36
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:12,891
<i>Are you okay?</i>

37
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:16,729
Maisie broke up with me.

38
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,402
Yes! Finally.

39
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:21,364
Oh, buddy, I'm sorry.

40
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:22,925
<i>What happened? Why?</i>

41
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:24,650
I don't know.

42
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:28,808
She said my life wasn't going anywhere.

43
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:34,605
I mean, what the fuck does that even mean?

44
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:36,336
Hey, you know what?
I'm gonna swing by right now.

45
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:37,361
<i>No!</i>

46
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:39,922
Clarence, I don't want you
to see me like this.

47
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:42,481
I look like Apollo Creed.

48
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:44,005
<i>Which Rocky?</i>

49
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:46,442
The one where he died.

50
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,602
Oh, boy. Okay. All right.

51
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:50,842
Hang on, I'm gonna be right there, okay?

52
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:52,851
Okay.

53
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:14,961
Oh!

54
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,490
Can I help you?

55
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:27,360
Hey-

56
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,286
Hey.

57
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:50,325
Here you go.

58
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:52,403
Go ahead. Drink some.

59
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,365
It's just milk.

60
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:56,010
I swear, look.

61
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:01,726
There.

62
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:05,961
You just drank it 'cause I drank it.

63
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:08,091
Oh, you're so hungry.

64
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:09,770
What?

65
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:11,246
Okay.

66
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:13,721
No, no, no, you need a bath.

67
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:15,962
All right, just stay there.

68
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:22,767
All right, we're gonna have to walk.

69
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:34,890
Rell, it's gonna be okay.

70
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:37,407
Now, I know you don't want to
hear this right now,

71
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:38,896
but everything happens for a reason.

72
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:39,921
You're right, Clarence.

73
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:42,287
Everything does happen for a reason.

74
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:43,527
I want you to meet

75
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:45,721
Keanu.

76
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:48,766
What?

77
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:49,921
No.

78
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:51,161
<i>No.</i>

79
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,249
On, my <i>God!</i>

80
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:55,687
That's the cutest cat
I've ever seen in my life.

81
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:57,490
Hello! I'm sorry, Keanu?

82
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:59,085
- Yeah.
- Okay.

83
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:02,130
I think it means "cool breeze"
in Hawaiian.

84
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:08,376
Honey, I'm sorry
I can't come with you guys this weekend.

85
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,576
It's just I've got all that
stuff to do around the house.

86
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:11,840
I understand, honey. It's fine.

87
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:13,296
I got the low-flow toilet to put in.

88
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:14,896
I just want you to do me
a little favor this weekend.

89
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:16,216
- Yeah.
- I want you to try and relax.

90
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:18,163
Right. Got it. Absolutely.
What do you mean?

91
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:20,243
Well, sometimes you can be
a little wound up.

92
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:21,925
Wound up? How am I wound up?

93
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:24,845
You're not hearing me.
You're not hearing me.

94
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,241
You spend so much time
trying to be the person

95
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,602
- you think everyone wants you to be.
- Okay.

96
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:32,081
And I just want you to be Clarence.

97
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:33,936
Okay, great.
If that's what you want, then...

98
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:35,216
- But, see, that's what I'm saying.
- No, no, no.

99
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:37,481
I mean, that's what I want,
so that's what I'm gonna do.

100
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:39,130
Deep breath. Ready?

101
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:40,486
Just...

102
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:42,284
Ah!

103
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,610
Loosen up your shoulders.

104
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:48,171
And what's crack-a-lacking,
beautiful people?

105
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,845
Hey, Spencer.

106
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,809
Hannah. A vision, as always.

107
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:52,961
Oh, thank you.

108
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:54,121
- Give me that.
- Okay.

109
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:55,880
- Clarence. Give me some skin.
- Spencer.

110
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:57,416
You got it, brother.
That's all the skin you get.

111
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,441
Where's Belle?

112
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:01,211
Oh, honey, let me get her for you. Belle!

113
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,126
- Them's some pipes.
- Right.

114
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:05,647
Our daughters just can't get
enough of each other, huh?

115
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:07,896
I'm tellin' ya. Girls, right?
Raising girls is the best.

116
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:09,001
- I tell ya, yeah.
- Yeah.

117
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:10,730
- Hey. Here we go.
- Thanks.

118
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:12,296
Hey, you know what?
Maybe when you get back,

119
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,200
we can see that new
Shailene Woodley movie, huh?

120
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:16,208
Clarence, you're embarrassing me.

121
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:18,329
- My bad.
- She got ya. She got ya.

122
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:22,160
- There we go. There.
- Let's do it, kids.

123
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,163
Get your seatbelt on, young ladies.

124
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,685
Okay. We got this.

125
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:26,966
Oh, honey.

126
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,120
<i>(HORN HONKS)
- Really got to go, guys.</i>

127
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,201
All right, sweetheart.

128
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:33,203
All right. Okay.

129
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:35,244
Uh, where's Micah?

130
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:38,483
Oh, well, unfortunately,
my beautiful bride sends her apologies.

131
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:39,920
She can't make it this weekend.

132
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:41,530
She's got food poisoning.

133
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:43,006
- Oh, no.
- Oh!

134
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:46,607
Yeah, poor thing. She was up all night
just projectile vomiting.

135
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:48,000
- Oh!
- And more.

136
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:49,856
You know.
I'll spare you the gritty details.

137
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:51,405
- Thanks.
- Oh! Oh, yeah.

138
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:53,164
And diarrhea is what I'm talking about.

139
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,361
<i>- Right.
- Oh.</i>

140
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:56,249
Great. So, no Micah, then?

141
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:59,047
No. No Micah this weekend.

142
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:00,685
That's okay. That's okay.

143
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:02,842
That's too bad. It's too bad. But, uh...

144
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,411
- it's fine.
- Okay. Well, yeah.

145
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,360
Take care.

146
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:08,648
<i>- And</i> have a <i>good time.</i>
- We will.

147
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:10,285
Oh, yep-

148
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:13,889
- Bye, honey.
- Drive safe. Bye, Belle.

149
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:16,361
Take care, guys! Have a great time!

150
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:20,361
Ah!

151
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,928
<i>Here's kitty!</i>

152
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,730
No, you don't want to go through there.

153
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:26,723
Look, you just want to
stay in there, okay?

154
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:29,400
She's just found your manuscript
and you're ferocious with that.

155
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:31,016
So, you're gonna stay right there. Yeah.

156
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:32,201
<i>Re“?</i>

157
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:33,765
Just find the space. In here!

158
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:34,921
Hey-

159
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:37,724
Wow, you're working again.

160
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:39,041
What is that?

161
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:41,242
- This is December.
- December?

162
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:42,731
Yeah, for the calendar.

163
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:44,882
I didn't tell you about
the calendar. Check it.

164
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:46,081
The calendar?

165
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,401
Oh!

166
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:53,361
- Well, this is amazing.
- Thanks.

167
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:55,324
You could make a bundle on this.

168
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:56,721
<i>Yeah, I know.</i>

169
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:58,570
I mean, I'm not gonna sell it.

170
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:01,087
- Oh!
- It's for personal use only. And family.

171
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:02,401
Oh, well, thank you.

172
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:04,841
No, I wouldn't want to exploit
Keanu's cuteness like that.

173
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:05,921
<i>Okay-</i>

174
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:12,524
You have been very productive.

175
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:14,683
- I know, right?
- Um...

176
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:15,921
Yeah. You know what?

177
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:17,445
This movie's in about 20 minutes.

178
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,096
- Are you ready to go?
- Uh, yes, okay.

179
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:20,167
Come here, buddy.

180
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:21,976
Good job today, man. You did really good.

181
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,560
I'm gonna put Keanu in his little nook.

182
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:24,601
Oh, he has a nook?

183
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:26,649
Of course he has a nook.
Everyone has a nook.

184
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,165
Okay. Hey, buddy.

185
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:29,810
House meeting.

186
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,445
I'm nothing without you.

187
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,320
<i>And at the same time,
I need you to clean up</i>

188
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:35,283
<i>your little area while I'm gone.
Is that cool?</i>

189
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:37,442
- I'll see you soon.
- Okay. Good.

190
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:38,806
Uh, say goodbye.

191
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:41,007
You're coming with me.

192
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:44,881
Right, yeah, of course. I'm sorry.

193
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,929
Uh, goodbye, Keanu.

194
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:49,446
Cool.

195
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:51,200
Now, we'll talk about it later.

196
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,691
Okay. Bye. Hey.

197
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:54,764
Get that bitch!

198
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:57,725
Get her! Get her!

199
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:59,848
Get her! Yeah!

200
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,331
I'm psyched for this movie, man.

201
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:02,840
Is that a photo of you and Maisie?

202
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:04,371
Yeah. <i>I</i> mean, <i>it</i> was.

203
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:07,967
That was amazing!
Movie of the year!

204
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:10,696
That is, like, the best Liam Neesons movie
I've ever seen in my life.

205
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:12,176
- Best Liam Neesons movie ever.
- Hands down.

206
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:14,043
I'm, like, jacked up from that movie!

207
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:17,283
- All right, settle down. Settle down.
- Whoo!

208
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:20,206
What a way to start a weekend,
you know what I mean?

209
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:21,771
That's good, because now,

210
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:24,321
I've got all that "doing me"
stuff out of the way,

211
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:26,403
and now tomorrow, I can mow the lawn,

212
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:27,816
- I can get my bills done.
- Hey. Hey.

213
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:32,164
You don't think that going and seeing
a Liam Neesons movie with me right now

214
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:34,288
counts towards you doing you.

215
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:35,656
- What? That is me doing me.
- No.

216
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:38,216
I wanted to see that movie.
Hannah would never go see that with me.

217
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:39,241
It's just the beginning.

218
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:41,656
You have something else planned
for the rest of the weekend?

219
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:43,200
We're gonna go to my house, right now.

220
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:44,810
We're gonna smoke some weed.

221
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:46,962
No, Rell. Hannah would...

222
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:49,208
Will love it. Hannah will love it.

223
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:50,725
You don't know my wife very well.

224
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:52,816
I know her well enough
to know that she's a woman,

225
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:55,366
and women like bad boys.

226
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:57,727
Who are you to give me this advice?
Are you bad?

227
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:01,720
I mean, I'm not saying I roll up,
fuckin' with my AK, poppin' fools.

228
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:02,960
No, you're not rolling up,

229
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:04,256
because that would require
a driver's license,

230
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:05,936
- which you, as a grown man, do not have.
- Fair enough.

231
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:08,216
So, there will be
no rolling up with AK's or anything else.

232
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:10,840
But I don't have a driver's license
'cause I'm from New York City.

233
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:12,325
NYC, baby.

234
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:14,240
Where, yeah, the dudes
that kicked my ass...

235
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:15,536
- Yes?
- ...were bigger than the dudes

236
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:16,696
that kicked your ass, motherfucker.

237
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,560
I'm from Detroit.
Detroit public school system.

238
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:21,211
Impossible. Guaranteed
the guys who kicked my ass

239
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:23,696
were twice as big and scary as
the guys who kicked your ass.

240
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:30,490
- No way.
- Guaranteed.

241
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:35,402
- Fine. So...
- Guaranteed.

242
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:36,721
You have to get the last one.

243
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:39,565
Do it. I don't care.
I'm not getting into a...

244
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:40,721
No way.

245
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:43,082
What makes you think
I can't handle my business?

246
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:45,322
<i>I've got it all on lock.
I'm good to go, drawg.</i>

247
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:47,445
I'm good to go, dude.

248
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:56,410
George Michael is holding it down.

249
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:00,487
- See, you just grooved on it.
- I'm not saying...

250
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:01,641
You just went...

251
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:03,365
I'm not saying it's not a good song.

252
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:05,522
I'm saying we should be listening to this.

253
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,125
What are you doing? You all right?

254
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:13,406
What is that?

255
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:38,201
Yeah. Roll on, po-po.

256
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:39,486
I'm sorry, no.

257
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:41,416
You don't get to say,
"Roll on, po-po" like that

258
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:44,523
after you just smiled
and waved to the police.

259
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:48,687
He ain't want none, did he?

260
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:50,845
<i>Re“, what does that mean'?</i>

261
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,207
Oh, snap. Is it raining?

262
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:56,045
Well, it's LA. It'll stop in a minute.

263
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:00,525
So, what? You're so hardcore,

264
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:02,523
you're just, like,
afraid of a little rain?

265
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:04,444
Why is your door open?

266
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:07,166
Keanu.

267
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:11,091
Keanu!

268
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:12,966
Keanu!

269
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,570
<i>Keanu!</i>

270
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,890
Keanu!

271
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:21,841
<i>Keanu!</i>

272
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:23,681
<i>Re“ .</i>

273
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:25,561
<i>Rell!</i>

274
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:29,721
I'm sorry.

275
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,047
No.

276
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:40,966
No!

277
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:43,600
I am so sorry, buddy.

278
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:46,441
No!

279
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:51,416
<i>CLARENCE". Listen, the cops are here now.</i>

280
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:52,856
<i>And they're gonna take care of it. Right.</i>

281
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:53,881
<i>They're professional.</i>

282
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:56,122
They take this kind of stuff seriously.

283
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:58,886
<i>Crimson Tide. Good one.</i>

284
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:02,246
These are good. You take these?

285
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:04,728
- They're just pictures.
- Keep them.

286
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:07,611
Do you think there's any chance
you might find the guys who did this?

287
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:08,921
Hell no.

288
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:11,003
In most burglaries,
the guys are never caught.

289
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:14,401
Oh, um...

290
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:16,769
You know, there might be a chance.

291
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:20,131
<i>I wish that I could be more help.</i>

292
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:22,681
I'm sorry, but I'm gonna have
to take that blanket back.

293
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:24,761
Oh.

294
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:28,045
This sucks.

295
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:29,850
Are you sure he was stolen?

296
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,923
These guys don't usually take pets.

297
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:35,243
Usually they're after drugs
or something they can sell for drugs.

298
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:38,481
<i>We'll keep an eye out for the cat.</i>

299
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:39,920
Thank you very much.

300
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:41,605
<i>Take care of each other.</i>

301
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:44,886
See, now that's promising.

302
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:47,168
Maybe Keanu will come back,
or maybe he'll...

303
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:48,446
<i>Re“?</i>

304
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:49,846
Where are you going?

305
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,001
Hulka's house.

306
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:52,525
Who is Hulka?

307
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,684
My weed dealer.

308
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:56,251
What?

309
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:58,971
You live across the way
from your weed dealer?

310
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:01,446
Oh, sup, sup, bro?

311
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:04,282
Hey, Hulka. This is my cousin, Clarence.

312
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:06,329
- Hello.
- Sup?

313
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:09,440
All right, in or out.

314
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:12,046
Can't leave the door open,
you know what I'm sayin'?

315
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:13,480
And don't fuck up all this shit.

316
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:15,010
I'm building a motorcycle.

317
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:17,483
So, the reason I'm here...

318
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:19,364
- Okay, look...
- No.

319
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:21,966
This is the perfect
sativa-dominant hybrid strain.

320
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:23,645
It's called Spoonie Gee.

321
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:26,883
Great. This is all great.
I'm not here for any of that.

322
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:28,720
I'm here because my place got broken into.

323
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:30,805
Oh, shit, you serious?

324
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:32,883
Oh, man, that suck a thick donkey ball.

325
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:34,804
What'd they get?

326
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,450
They got Keanu.

327
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:38,170
- Oh, shit. The little guy?
- Yeah.

328
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:40,049
Oh, fuck, man. I'm sorry, bro.

329
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:41,287
Okay. So...

330
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:42,601
Thank you.

331
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:44,250
I got an anti-sadness strain in here.

332
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:46,136
- It's called Walking on Sunshine.
- No, no. I don't care.

333
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,969
No, I'm not here for weed, man.

334
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:51,488
I'm here just to ask you
some questions. Like,

335
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:55,087
has anyone shady come by here
in the last couple of days?

336
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,923
Well, I mean... Well, um...

337
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:01,843
You know, I run
a professional business here.

338
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,844
I never had a dissatisfied customer.

339
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:07,249
I don't know,
it's a real fucking quandary.

340
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:10,324
Maybe it's someone that
you're selling all of this marijuana to.

341
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:14,605
Yeah. Or maybe it was somebody who thought
they were breaking into your house?

342
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:16,360
Oh, yeah. Look, bro.

343
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:18,522
I be real with you, okay?

344
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:21,968
I'm so fucking high right now.
I'm not even sure you're real.

345
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:23,491
I'm just like, where am I?

346
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:25,051
Where did all these eels come from?

347
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,201
Oh, shit!

348
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:27,361
No, no, no.

349
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:29,647
No, no, no, no.

350
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:31,481
Hulka!

351
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:33,560
Who the fuck would want to
break into your house?

352
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:36,521
The Blips.

353
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:37,886
<i>Man, the Blips.</i>

354
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:39,166
The Blips?

355
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:42,842
These are the guys that were kicked out
of the Bloods and the Crips.

356
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,286
The Blips.

357
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:45,885
Blood-Grips, Blips.

358
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:49,044
<i>I've started getting into
selling some heavier shit,</i>

359
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,850
<i>and when you're selling the heavier shit,</i>

360
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,571
turf becomes a thing. You know?

361
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:56,644
And so, yeah. I mean,
the 17th Street Blips,

362
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:58,564
they did tell me, you know,

363
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:01,007
they gonna break in and "fuck my shit up."

364
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:03,921
<i>But... I mean, that's not,
like, concrete proof.</i>

365
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:06,521
The 17th Street Blips.
Okay, where are they?

366
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:08,721
17th Street.

367
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:10,245
Be specific!

368
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:13,404
Dude, look! I get you lost your kitty-cat,

369
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:17,326
but y'all some dumb fucks if
you think I'm gonna be a rat.

370
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:20,927
I ain't some punk-ass bitch
who's gonna be intimidated by y'all nerds!

371
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:22,411
- You...
- Nerds...

372
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:24,847
Yeah, that's right! You a fuckin' nerd!

373
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,889
- What you doing?
- What do you think I'm doing?

374
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:30,601
Oh, shit! You fucking crazy?

375
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:32,205
No, not my De La!

376
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:33,850
Yeah, I got your De La now, bitch.

377
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,240
Hulka? ls everything okay?

378
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:36,930
Mom, not now!

379
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:38,081
Bro, no.

380
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:40,169
Oh, you fuck!

381
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:41,361
What's this?

382
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:43,600
No, no, no! Not Grandmaster.
Not Grandmaster, please!

383
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:44,761
Tell me!

384
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:47,924
Okay, okay! Dude's at a strip club
called Hot Party Vixens.

385
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:50,327
<i>Okay? But this dude, their leader,</i>

386
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:52,960
his name is Cheddar,
and he is a bad motherfucker.

387
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:55,442
<i>You don't wanna mess with him.</i>

388
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:57,968
Dude, you lost your cat.

389
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:00,803
You lost your cat.

390
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:02,161
Come on, Rell.

391
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:04,482
<i>We'll figure something out in the morning.</i>

392
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:06,170
<i>It's not over.</i>

393
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:10,649
All right, this is the place.

394
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:12,609
Hot Party Vixens.

395
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:15,485
HPV.

396
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:17,005
That's unfortunate.

397
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:19,561
Check it. We're going to approach the bar.

398
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:22,121
Then we are going to
explain the situation.

399
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:23,481
- No, no, no.
- Yeah.

400
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:25,376
See, you're talking about
explaining the situation.

401
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:28,483
Hulka said this is a crazy
drug dealer named Cheddar.

402
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:29,641
So?

403
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:31,484
What's so scary about "Cheddar"?

404
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:32,971
Cheddar is a psychopath name.

405
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:36,011
You only name yourself
something adorable if you can back it up.

406
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:37,936
- I don't think that's a thing.
- That's a thing.

407
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:39,849
If you meet a guy named
Fluffy Pink Bunny Head,

408
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,161
he will stab you in the eye.

409
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:44,005
I'm sure that this Cheddar guy
is gonna be reasonable about money.

410
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:46,686
And, if need be,
we will just buy Keanu back.

411
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:48,683
No, no. Not like that. Come on, just...

412
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:49,841
What, this?

413
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:52,522
- Yeah, pop the collar.
- Uh...

414
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,126
- Okay?
- Yeah.

415
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:57,845
It's what the kids are doing.

416
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,001
Not really.

417
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:00,851
But okay.

418
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:03,725
- Ready?
- Yeah.

419
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:28,720
Wow!

420
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:32,043
God gave you one face.
Why would you change it?

421
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:33,247
Nope, Clarence-

422
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:35,004
I just don't understand that at all.

423
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:36,286
- No, no, no.
- No, what?

424
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:37,481
No, this was a bad idea.

425
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:40,405
Isn't your cat here?
We need to get the cat.

426
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:42,369
- Hey, baby.
- Hello, how do you do?

427
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:44,568
Oh, dear. Okay.

428
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:45,721
I'm, uh...

429
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:47,962
I'm flattered. Thank you.

430
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:49,161
But I am married.

431
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:50,401
No.

432
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:52,528
- Thank you.
- Oh...

433
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:54,051
You just took my wedding ring.

434
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:55,856
No, no, no. We're here,
we're here, you're good.

435
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:56,881
One beer, please.

436
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:58,366
I'll take a white wine...

437
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:00,056
Sir, that young lady just took
my wedding ring,

438
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:01,216
- so I'm wondering...
- it's all right.

439
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:04,084
- No, no. Clarence, Clarence, Clarence!
- Yeah.

440
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:06,004
You can't talk like that here.

441
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:08,806
- Okay?
- I can't talk like what?

442
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:12,282
You sound like Richard Pryor
doing an impression of a white guy.

443
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:16,927
I do not sound like Richard Pryor
doing an impression of a white guy.

444
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:18,570
"I do not sound like Richard Pryor

445
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:20,529
"doing an impression of a white guy."

446
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:22,762
You sound like John Ritter all the time.

447
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:25,526
Well, I beg to differ, nigga.

448
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:27,284
N-word. Went straight to the N-word.

449
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:28,936
- Yeah. Yeah, I did.
- It's not authentic.

450
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:30,416
Because that's how
real people talk, Clarence.

451
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:32,204
No, it is not in my experience.

452
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:34,096
- It's not how people talk.
- Please, please, you're wrong.

453
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:37,056
You understand? People understand
the historical significance of that word,

454
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:38,280
and that you can't just say it

455
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:39,936
shiftlessly with no
responsibility whatsoever.

456
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:41,291
Absolutely wrong. 100% wrong.

457
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:43,283
Listen, this is life.

458
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:45,283
You listen to me. You don't shush me.

459
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:46,885
You niggas in the right place?

460
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:49,601
Yeah, we in the right place, nigga!

461
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:52,041
You in the right place, nigga?

462
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:54,642
Who the fuck are these niggas?

463
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:56,006
Who the fuck are we?

464
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:58,401
Who the fuck aren't we?

465
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:01,166
- Oh!
- Are you trying to die today?

466
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:03,890
Nah.

467
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:05,485
We ain't trying to die today.

468
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:07,768
Let me break it down right quick.

469
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:09,968
Y'all gonna take us to Cheddar,

470
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:12,487
and then we can start nailin'
down the hows and whens

471
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:14,051
and wherefores and...

472
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:15,241
Whys.

473
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:17,801
Did I not mention the whys?
The whys, too, motherfucker.

474
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:20,008
- Well, look here, homeboy.
- Yeah, dude.

475
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:22,561
You in Bliptown now,

476
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:24,484
and you don't make the rules.

477
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:26,244
Cheddar does.

478
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:29,842
And you don't meet Cheddar
until you meet me.

479
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:31,520
You feel me?

480
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,810
So who the fuck are you niggas?

481
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:36,810
Nigga...

482
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:38,890
Nigga, nigga...

483
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:41,128
- Psst. Tell her, man.
- Nigga...

484
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:45,243
I'm Techtonic.

485
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:46,965
- Nice!
- Thank you.

486
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:48,921
What about you?

487
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:52,083
My name is Shark Tank.

488
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:57,360
Well, look here,
Techtonic and Shark Tank.

489
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:00,569
Cheddar is a businessman.
He don't take drop-bys.

490
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:02,404
You think we don't mean business?

491
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:07,401
And swam.

492
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:11,731
Why don't you search 'em, Bud?

493
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:13,882
Go on ahead, Bud.

494
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:16,203
These niggas not strapped.

495
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:20,806
- Come on.
- Yeah, let's come on, then.

496
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:53,246
What's up, motherfucker?

497
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:54,765
MANI <i>What?</i>

498
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:04,089
Chill. Hey, yo, Cheddar.

499
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:19,169
You'll get it next time, boss.

500
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:30,161
Hi-C.

501
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:33,130
The fuck is this?

502
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:34,327
I'm Techtonic.

503
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:36,881
Sup, Cheddar? Finally.

504
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:39,122
- He's Shark...
- The king pimp himself.

505
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:40,281
Shark Tank.

506
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:44,081
Yeah, I mean, we've been looking
forward to this, dawg. Ha-ha!

507
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:46,971
Talkin' about the H-N-I-C.

508
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:48,281
My man.

509
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:50,606
All right.

510
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:51,841
Yeah.

511
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:55,960
You know, I got a lot of enemies

512
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:59,562
that would love to walk in this room
and put a bullet hole in old Cheddar.

513
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:01,606
Hey!

514
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:04,803
We ain't got no beef with you, Cheddar.

515
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,571
No? How about now, nigga?

516
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:12,442
That's a nice piece.

517
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:16,607
You should keep the safety on.

518
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:18,689
You know what? I get it.

519
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:20,205
Hi-C, what the fuck is this, huh?

520
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:23,011
You bring me a couple of bitch-ass niggas
as a joke, right?

521
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:26,249
- What?
- Us? Uh, no.

522
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:28,010
I'm sorry, bitch-ass niggas?

523
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:30,010
<i>Am I right, Tech?</i>

524
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:32,288
It's been a long-ass time
since we heard that.

525
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:35,882
- Oh, really?
- Yeah, nigga.

526
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:40,645
We killed 25 dudes this month, man.

527
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:43,522
So, if y'all so fuckin' real,

528
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:45,842
why ain't I never seent you before?

529
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:47,771
- Well...
- Oh!

530
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:49,445
That's because...

531
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:51,011
I don't know,

532
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:55,370
maybe we didn't wanna be seent.

533
00:26:58,720 --> 00:26:59,721
Wait a minute.

534
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:03,730
Y'all them Allentown niggas, ain't you?

535
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:05,166
- Us? Yes.
- Nah.

536
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:06,810
- Yes, Techtonic.
- Yeah, what?

537
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:08,724
Nigga, yes, we them Allentown niggas.

538
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:10,160
What the fuck is wrong with you?

539
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:11,201
This nigga acting like

540
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:13,408
- he got amnesia up here, fucking around.
- Crazy.

541
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:15,608
Shit.

542
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:18,766
Why didn't y'all say something
earlier, man?

543
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:22,047
We was tryin' to stay incognito.

544
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:23,765
You gotta keep 'em on their toes!

545
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:29,244
Oh, damn.

546
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:33,045
Why don't y'all come over here,
have a seat so we can talk?

547
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:34,611
Okay, yeah.

548
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:40,609
You know, uh...

549
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:43,565
I heard how it went down
at King Diaz's church.

550
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:45,444
That was some cold shit.

551
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:47,849
You know, man, that's how we do.

552
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,401
<i>You know, we gets to do, 'now we do.</i>

553
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:51,726
Oh, damn!

554
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:53,496
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Don't worry about her, man.

555
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:54,521
That's Montana.

556
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:56,245
<i>All right.</i>

557
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:59,842
Hey, man, you know,
as much as I love snakes,

558
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,685
I think we need to go
to the bathroom real quick

559
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:03,887
and drain ours.

560
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:06,771
Well played, yep. That's what
we should do. Mmm-hmm.

561
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:08,445
Oh, look who's up from their nap.

562
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:16,886
Hey-

563
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:19,086
Cute cat.

564
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:23,846
Uh, yeah. This is my nigga,
New Jack, right here, man.

565
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:25,530
Yup. Hey, but, look,

566
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:27,736
before y'all go run off
and do your little tinkle...

567
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:29,285
Where'd you get him?

568
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:36,563
Seems to me,

569
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:39,883
no stupid-ass nigga in his right mind

570
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:42,486
would let a cat like that go willy-nilly.

571
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:43,961
The fuck?

572
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:46,402
How much you want for him?

573
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:47,966
He serious?

574
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:50,165
Actually, he is, man.

575
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:53,244
We in the market right now
for a gangsta pet, so...

576
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:56,967
Oh, well, he ain't for sale.

577
00:28:57,920 --> 00:28:59,968
Everything has a price.

578
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:01,685
At a pet store.

579
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:04,486
But this ain't no motherfucking
pet store, nigga.

580
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:05,896
<i>CLARENCE". Well, that's a shame.</i>

581
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:07,001
Um...

582
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:09,163
<i>Thank you for sharing your time.</i>

583
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:10,810
I said,

584
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:13,961
everything has its price.

585
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:19,081
Well, shit. I mean, damn.

586
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:21,447
Y'all drive a hard-ass bargain.

587
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:24,162
All right. Hey.
I'll be right back, pimpin'.

588
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:28,607
I wanna show y'all something. Come on.

589
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:33,525
Come on.

590
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:39,887
I don't know if y'all know
what we slinging these days.

591
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:41,680
Holy Shit.

592
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:45,282
Holy shit, indeed.

593
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:47,530
Nah, man.

594
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:50,371
That's what it's called, man. Holy Shit.

595
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:53,171
Only you ain't heard of it yet
because it's new.

596
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:56,005
And we the only ones that got it in LA.

597
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:57,961
<i>What you're looking at</i>

598
00:29:58,120 --> 00:30:00,487
is a cross between PCP,

599
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:03,723
MDMA and DMT.

600
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:05,926
Imean...

601
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:09,569
One puff of this, and holy shit!

602
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:10,926
It's like you...

603
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:15,528
Smokin' crack with God.

604
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:21,405
So, uh, maybe y'all can accompany
these fools on a run.

605
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:24,404
You know, show 'em how y'all
get down over in Allentown.

606
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:28,163
Well, you know, actually, though, um...

607
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:30,288
- Like a run, run?
- Yeah.

608
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:32,169
You do that,

609
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:36,129
I'll give you New Jack
as a gesture of respect.

610
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:39,764
Wow. But, unfortunately, we...

611
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:41,445
Deal.

612
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:43,170
Deal. Y'all hear that?

613
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:46,084
<i>They gonna shadow you.</i>

614
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:48,240
So you make sure you listen to
every word they say

615
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:49,816
and you take it as gospel, you understand?

616
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:51,576
But right quick, though,
right quick, though,

617
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:52,726
Cheddar, seriously, man.

618
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:54,882
I just was thinking about
what's been going on.

619
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:57,367
As recently, our docket is full, nigga...

620
00:30:57,520 --> 00:30:59,966
And at the same time, Cheddar,

621
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:04,444
if I can get a moment
to discuss with my colleague.

622
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:06,963
Let's go, let's go, let's go, now!

623
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:08,256
It doesn't have to be that hard.

624
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:09,936
I will not sell drugs.
I can't sell drugs, Rell.

625
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:10,961
This was your idea.

626
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:12,416
You were the one that wanted
to come here, man.

627
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:13,441
All right, listen.

628
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:15,961
You were the one who said
we were the Allentown niggas.

629
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:17,645
I am not breaking the law.

630
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:19,689
It's easy. It's easy, though. It's easy!

631
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:21,336
- What's easy?
- I've seen Hulka do this.

632
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:23,567
He just stands there. People want drugs.

633
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:26,803
We just feed them some
bullshit about New <i>Jack City,</i>

634
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:28,086
and we just get Keanu.

635
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:30,442
I'm not jeopardizing my family
by selling drugs, okay?

636
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:31,761
- Or...
- Or?

637
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:33,729
- Maybe you'll like it.
- What?

638
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:35,296
Maybe you'll like
being a bad motherfucker.

639
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:36,481
No, no.

640
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:38,483
- You're good at it.
- What?

641
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:41,291
And it's just team building.
This is what you do.

642
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:43,249
I don't do team building for drug rings.

643
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:44,481
I do it for corporate...

644
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:46,480
- Ever hear of corporate crime?
- That's not...

645
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:48,130
- Y'all ready?
- Yeah.

646
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:49,805
Yeah.

647
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:51,610
Good. Let's go.

648
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:53,564
You ready, Shark Tank?

649
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:55,641
Yeah.

650
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:58,121
I'm fuckin' ready, Techtonic.

651
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:20,851
Sup, sup?

652
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:22,371
Finders keepers, yo.

653
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:24,045
Hey, keep your distance, yo.

654
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:26,009
No, no, no. Know what I'm saying?

655
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:27,889
No, don't shut that door. No, no, no.

656
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:30,042
I'm about to leave, anyway, so...

657
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:33,290
All right, y'all.

658
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:34,851
Gather 'round and whatnot.

659
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:37,444
So, seriously, what's gonna happen now

660
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:39,722
before we get on this job,
it's time for us to all

661
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:41,564
<i>get to know each other
a little bit better.</i>

662
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:43,324
We gonna go in a circle, first of all,

663
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:44,885
and everyone gonna say their name

664
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:46,440
and then two things about yourself.

665
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:47,881
<i>For instance.</i>

666
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:50,328
My name is Shark Tank.

667
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:52,761
And I ran hurdles in high school.

668
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:54,564
And I like to hold my gun like this.

669
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:57,129
<i>So, that's me.</i>

670
00:32:57,800 --> 00:32:59,962
I'm Techtonic.

671
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:03,530
- I once shot two dudes with one bullet.
- Blam.

672
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:05,563
And I went to a exclusive,

673
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:07,802
early screening of
The <i>Blair Witch</i> Project.

674
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,047
- You did?
- Yeah.

675
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:10,247
I did not know that. See?

676
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:12,376
That was before we even knew
if it was real or not.

677
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:14,562
That's right. People thought
that shit was real.

678
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:16,285
Go on, nigga.

679
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:18,160
I'm Bud.

680
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:22,282
And I got into gang bangin'
after I got stabbed by my moms.

681
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:25,249
I'm gonna need two things, though.

682
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:27,246
And my grandma.

683
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:30,731
Well, you know, them family reunions
get crazy sometimes, man.

684
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:32,120
Thanks for sharing, brother.

685
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:33,924
Whassup? I'm Trunk.

686
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:35,605
I got a knock-out left hook.

687
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:36,881
Mmm-hmm.

688
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:38,081
I got my name

689
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:40,576
because I accidentally locked
my car keys in my trunk once.

690
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:42,840
- It happens to the best of us, dawg.
- With a dead body.

691
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:44,646
Okay.

692
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:46,806
Yeah, well, you know,

693
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,446
Trunk is a better name than Dead Body.

694
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:57,010
Let's move on. What about you?

695
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:58,207
Yeah.

696
00:33:58,560 --> 00:33:59,891
Stitches.

697
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:02,081
And?

698
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:03,844
Two things about yourself?

699
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:08,651
Nah, nigga.

700
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:10,290
Okay, you know what, Shark Tank?

701
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:12,448
I think, in his own way,

702
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:14,329
Stitches did share something
about hisself.

703
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:16,005
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

704
00:34:16,160 --> 00:34:18,322
- We should move on.
- Yeah, okay.

705
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:20,171
I'm Hi-C.

706
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:23,810
First off, uh, I don't like
niggas I don't know.

707
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:25,644
Second, I'm real curious

708
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:29,122
about what exactly went down
at the Diaz church massacre.

709
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:30,441
- Mmm-hmm.
- Yeah.

710
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:33,521
Okay.

711
00:34:33,680 --> 00:34:36,206
Now we all know things about each other.

712
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:38,806
So, let's knock this job out real quick.

713
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:41,770
Was it really like the word on the street?

714
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:46,283
What was the word on the streets?

715
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:48,886
Blood bath. Hundred executions.

716
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:51,566
- Yeah.
- Yeah, at least 100.

717
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:52,801
Hundred, 101.

718
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:54,336
And you ran up the wall
and did a back flip,

719
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:56,089
and came down
and was still shooting niggas.

720
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:57,361
Mmm.

721
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:59,363
Damn straight. Did that, too.

722
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:00,681
Well, show us.

723
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,923
- Hmm?
- Show us!

724
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:04,201
- The flip, hmm?
- Yeah.

725
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:07,331
- I think we'd all like to see that.
- Um...

726
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:13,161
All right, let me explain
somethin' to y'all real quick.

727
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:15,687
It ain't gonna be like you think.

728
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:19,250
Cheddar already told y'all,
we ain't here...

729
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:21,408
ALLI Oh!

730
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:23,808
Damn, nigga! You see that shit?

731
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:25,485
He did it. He flipped it?

732
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:28,121
He flipped it.

733
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:29,480
Bring it in right here, homie.

734
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:31,170
<i>Whoo! All right!</i>

735
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:33,484
It's like black Jesus up in here.

736
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:35,085
That's what I'm talking about.

737
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:36,924
Oh, my God!
I just did a flip. Oh, my God!

738
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:39,082
<i>Shit! That Shit is crazy.</i>

739
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:43,811
So next time we tell y'all
we did somethin',

740
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:47,883
take our word that we did somethin'.

741
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:49,730
- Now let's see you do it.
- Yeah.

742
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:51,245
- What?
- Sorry?

743
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:53,129
Your turn, nigga.

744
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:56,370
Only he's flippin' today.

745
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:58,090
Only I'm flippin' today, y'all.

746
00:35:58,240 --> 00:35:59,526
We alternate flip days.

747
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:03,162
<i>Okay, today's the day
where I'm gonna be doin' all the flips.</i>

748
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:04,970
<i>Y'all ain't gonna see him flip today.</i>

749
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:08,090
I'll flip the fuck
outta that shit tomorrow.

750
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:09,241
<i>Ooh, yeah!</i>

751
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:10,606
Hey!

752
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:13,081
Let's flip the subject
and go flip some Holy Shit.

753
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:14,287
- Okay?
- Hells yeah, dirt.

754
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:15,856
<i>Let's take care of that.
- Exactly.</i>

755
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:18,451
Yo, everybody won't fit into my car.

756
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:20,087
My brothers. My brothers.

757
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:22,000
Come on, just tell me
what you want from me.

758
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:24,447
Look, take anything. It's all yours, okay?

759
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:26,125
Okay? Hey, y'all like weed?

760
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:28,521
Just untie me, I'll go get it for you.

761
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:30,603
Fuck! No!

762
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:32,967
No! Come on! I didn't do shit!

763
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:34,281
<i>I wouldn't...</i>

764
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:35,771
Oh, shit.

765
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:37,610
I'm the fuckin' cat, aren't I?

766
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:39,808
<i>That's what you're gonna do to me.</i>

767
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:41,610
I ain't scared.

768
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,650
The cat? The cat...

769
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:48,086
You're looking for Keanu?

770
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:51,449
The cat's at Hot Party Vixens.
You know, that strip club downtown.

771
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:53,369
You guys, don't kill me.

772
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:55,927
I fuckin' know everything about hip-hop.

773
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:06,411
Yo, Shark, no disrespecting, now, man,

774
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:10,089
but why you drive this weak-ass van?

775
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:15,241
You wanna get caught,
go ahead, drive a little drug car.

776
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:18,450
<i>But you wanna never get pulled over again,</i>

777
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:21,491
you drive a inconspicuous family vehicle.

778
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:24,962
Inconspicuous, least hardcore,

779
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:28,841
motherfuckin' soccer mom,
Full House thing.

780
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,684
Where we goin' again?

781
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:32,360
Just head towards the Hollywood Hills.

782
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:33,925
I'll guide you from there.

783
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:36,687
Wordness to the turdness.

784
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:45,970
Here we are.

785
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:52,921
<i>You comm"?</i>

786
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:58,521

00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:00,885

Nah. Fuck that. You comin' with.

789
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:04,480
Cheddar said you was gonna
show me how to do this.

790
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:06,005
Yeah, go ahead, Techtonic.

791
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:08,766
I'ma show these guys how to keep watch.

792
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:11,005
Thank you, Shark Tank.

793
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:12,440
You're more than welcome, nigga.

794
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:15,086
Come on. We gotta
get this over with, man.

795
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:18,323
Don't worry about it, baby.

796
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:20,409
Ain't no thang.

797
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:22,729
Ain't no thang.

798
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:35,724
Watch and learn.

799
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:43,089
Hi!

800
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:12,608
Ah! Yay! You guys are here!

801
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:14,205
On, finally!

802
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,365
What's up?

803
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:20,131
Somebody order some drugs?

804
00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:23,802
Yes! Oh, my God!

805
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,810
I was just telling these guys

806
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:30,203
about this job that I did in
Paris for a couple of months,

807
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:32,283
and this guy, he let me
smoke some of this stuff.

808
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:35,762
<i>And I swear to God, this drug is insane.</i>

809
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:37,251
<i>And the beauty is,</i>

810
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:40,007
every trip is different!

811
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:43,682
Ha! Can I please see it?

812
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:47,128
Ooh. Backpack. Backpack.

813
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:50,122
<i>Got</i> a <i>neat little backpack.</i>

814
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:53,968
Yes!

815
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:56,322
Oh, my God, yes!

816
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:58,284
Come on, please, please, please! Come sit.

817
00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:00,204
Have a drink. Sit down!

818
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:02,488
Sorry, we just want to see the money.

819
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:10,842
You see, Donnie,

820
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:14,970
some people don't respect the game.

821
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:16,606
What game?

822
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:18,120
Life!

823
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:21,286
Life is a fuckin' game!

824
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:22,845
<i>And the only real question is,</i>

825
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,890
<i>who are the players
and who are the pieces?</i>

826
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:28,202
Come on, you guys.
Let's smoke some Holy Shit.

827
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:29,561
No, no, no.

828
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:31,805
<i>Thought I made myself clear.</i>

829
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:33,610
We're not interested.

830
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:53,481
Man, fuck!

831
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:55,608
Let's get some tunes
goin' in this motherfucker.

832
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:56,936
- Something, man.
- Tunes, man, yeah.

833
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:58,849
Fuck, yeah. Let's see what we got here.

834
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,200
- I know you got some killer shit.
- Actually, no, we...

835
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:04,204
What? Yo.

836
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:07,967
Yo, Shark Tank, my nigga.
Um...

837
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:12,726
What the fuck is this?

838
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:16,769
Oh...

839
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:20,088
Shit, niggas!

840
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:22,527
This my shit right here!

841
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:24,241
This your shit?

842
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:27,288
This shit sound kinda white.

843
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:29,491
- White? White?
- Yeah.

844
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:32,166
Niggas, this is
George Michael, right here.

845
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:35,927
All right? This one of the greatest
recording artists of all time, man.

846
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:38,162
This the real OG up in here.

847
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:39,526
So,

848
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:41,611
he black, then?

849
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:45,081
You know, he light-skinned.

850
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:47,846
And then, he used to roll
with this nigga, Ridgeley.

851
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,001
Yeah.

852
00:41:49,160 --> 00:41:52,004
And then, George Michael
was trying to do that solo thing, right?

853
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:53,730
And then, wham!

854
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:59,327
Then nobody never see Ridgeley ever again.

855
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:01,922
He killed the motherfucker?

856
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:03,680
Nobody

857
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:05,606
ever

858
00:42:06,120 --> 00:42:07,360
SEED

859
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,525
him

860
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:11,290
again.

861
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:12,841
Shit.

862
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,684
I'll fuck with that nigga.

863
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:16,530
I'll fuck with him.

864
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:18,808
- Hey, hey, y'all.
- If he start that shit.

865
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:21,930
Wait till y'all hear
this next track, though, dirt.

866
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:23,881
You know,

867
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:26,407
in samurai times,

868
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:28,485
a refusal

869
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:31,088
to sit at a man's court

870
00:42:31,240 --> 00:42:34,210
was considered a profound
insult to his honor.

871
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:41,928
Ha! I'm just fucking with you!

872
00:42:42,120 --> 00:42:43,804
You should have seen your face.

873
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:46,210
Oh, my God.

874
00:42:46,360 --> 00:42:48,488
Oh, that was amazing.

875
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:49,801
Mmm.

876
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:51,925
Crazy.

877
00:42:52,080 --> 00:42:53,161
Whoo!

878
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:56,526
The man asked for the money.

879
00:42:56,680 --> 00:42:57,841
Yeah.

880
00:43:00,040 --> 00:43:01,690
Rachel, get the bag.

881
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:03,521
I'm not your slave.

882
00:43:03,720 --> 00:43:05,324
Get the fucking bag!

883
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:12,201
Ooh!

884
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:16,970
I loved you in
The House Bunny, by the way.

885
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:19,243
- Thank you, man.
- Yeah. Yeah.

886
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:21,243
You know this chick?

887
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:24,123
It's Anna Faris, the actress.

888
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:25,686
She's in movies?

889
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:28,724
<i>Lost in Translation?</i>

890
00:43:29,240 --> 00:43:31,368
<i>Chipwrecked? The Squeakquel?</i>

891
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:33,961
Scary <i>Movie?</i>

892
00:43:34,120 --> 00:43:35,645
Oh... You in that movie?

893
00:43:35,840 --> 00:43:37,763
<i>Scary Movie 1, 2, 3 and 4.</i>

894
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:39,604
Not 5. Too old.

895
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:40,801
Hmm.

896
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:42,650
But, enough! Enough! Enough!

897
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:45,929
No more Hollywood talk.
I'm so sick of this bullshit.

898
00:43:46,120 --> 00:43:48,726
<i>- Yeah.
- All I care about</i>

899
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:51,010
is truth.

900
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:54,291
Or dare.

901
00:43:56,520 --> 00:43:58,010
Truth or dare!

902
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:08,490
Yo, that chorus
do kick in nice, though.

903
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:10,722
It does, don't it? Yeah, yeah. I mean,

904
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:12,848
y'all hear the father figure part, right?

905
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:14,201
Because, my man right here,

906
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:17,489
he didn't have his own
positive male role model in his life.

907
00:44:17,640 --> 00:44:18,846
So...

908
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:20,001
Damn!

909
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:21,525
Yo, I never knew my daddy.

910
00:44:21,720 --> 00:44:23,324
- Really?
- No.

911
00:44:53,640 --> 00:44:55,722
Man, George Michael the shit, man!

912
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:57,684
- Right, dawg?
- Right on, man.

913
00:44:57,880 --> 00:44:59,120
Love that man.

914
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:01,602
Truth.

915
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:04,451
What is

916
00:45:04,600 --> 00:45:07,843
the dirtiest, most fucked-up
thing you've ever done?

917
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:10,441
Mmm...

918
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,809
You know, you don't have to...

919
00:45:13,960 --> 00:45:16,964
This dude cheated on my sister
and I cut his dick off.

920
00:45:17,160 --> 00:45:18,969
Oh... Uh...

921
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:22,484
Fuck, yeah!

922
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:26,008
That is the kind of shit
you should get paid for.

923
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:28,051
Thank you.

924
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:30,481
<i>Okay, your turn, same question.</i>

925
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:34,723
Most fucked-up?

926
00:45:38,920 --> 00:45:41,400
I once cut two dicks off.

927
00:45:42,840 --> 00:45:45,081
Yeah, that's right.

928
00:45:46,440 --> 00:45:47,851
They didn't even see it coming.

929
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:49,001
Snuck up on them.

930
00:45:49,160 --> 00:45:51,242
<i>Got real close.</i>

931
00:45:52,080 --> 00:45:55,323
One of them was long, thin, pointy,
like a pencil.

932
00:45:56,960 --> 00:45:59,884
The other one was short, girthy.

933
00:46:00,840 --> 00:46:02,683
Had a little bit of heft to it.

934
00:46:04,360 --> 00:46:09,048
<i>Got up in there lickety-split,
snip, snip, yeah.</i>

935
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:12,644
I took them, too.

936
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:16,407
So, yeah, I'm a motherfuckin' dick-taker.

937
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:25,369
300 for the dick-taker.

938
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:28,566
Okay.

939
00:46:31,880 --> 00:46:34,963
- So, Allentown...
- What? Nigga, fuck, what? Nigga.

940
00:46:35,120 --> 00:46:36,536
Tell me about it, man. Was it crazy?

941
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:37,561
Surely should have been.

942
00:46:37,720 --> 00:46:38,721
Was it...

943
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:41,531
Hells bells, hold on
to your shells, nigga.

944
00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:43,682
Shit was crazy, shit was crazy.

945
00:46:43,840 --> 00:46:47,242
We was just dodging bullets
on a everyday basis.

946
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:49,402
You know, just for survival.

947
00:46:50,280 --> 00:46:52,601
But, you know, the thing
about me and Techtonic,

948
00:46:52,760 --> 00:46:54,569
is our communication skills.

949
00:46:54,720 --> 00:46:57,291
That's the backbone of our teamwork.

950
00:46:58,080 --> 00:47:00,003
- You feel me?
- Yeah.

951
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:01,366
I get that.

952
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:02,760
All right.

953
00:47:04,320 --> 00:47:05,845
- You know what?
- Mmm.

954
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:09,886
I never told y'all niggas how I got this.

955
00:47:12,200 --> 00:47:15,124
A kid stabbed me
'cause I stole his Ring Pop.

956
00:47:16,280 --> 00:47:18,009
That's awful, man.

957
00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:19,685
How old were you?

958
00:47:19,840 --> 00:47:20,921
Twenty-three.

959
00:47:21,400 --> 00:47:23,926
Oh. Okay. Well...

960
00:47:24,440 --> 00:47:26,204
Yeah, thank you for sharing, though.

961
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:27,925
That felt good.

962
00:47:28,440 --> 00:47:29,885
I got one, too. Check it out.

963
00:47:30,040 --> 00:47:31,120
Okay, yeah. Let's see that.

964
00:47:31,240 --> 00:47:32,287
Buckshot.

965
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:34,485
Holding up a liquor store.

966
00:47:34,640 --> 00:47:35,846
Oh, man.

967
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:39,569
And then he shot you, man. That's crazy.

968
00:47:39,720 --> 00:47:42,291
Nah, actually, it made the news,

969
00:47:42,440 --> 00:47:44,841
and when I got back to my
grandmamma house, she shot me.

970
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,656
Okay, you know, you need to spend
a little less time with your family.

971
00:47:47,680 --> 00:47:49,091
I'm gonna advise that.

972
00:47:49,560 --> 00:47:50,840
- Hell, yeah.
- So, what you got?

973
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:53,281
- Me? Oh, okay, let me, um...
- Yeah, yeah.

974
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:57,281
Come on, man.
You got a bunch of shit, man.

975
00:47:57,440 --> 00:47:59,080
- Here it is.
- You ain't gotta be modest.

976
00:48:01,680 --> 00:48:03,205
A damn-ass street fight.

977
00:48:03,400 --> 00:48:04,606
Appendix.

978
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:06,126
Blam...

979
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:08,441
Your appendix?

980
00:48:08,600 --> 00:48:10,443
- They took it out of my body.
- What?

981
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:12,005
Mmm-hmm. Mmm-hmm.

982
00:48:12,200 --> 00:48:13,725
Y'all don't even want to hear about

983
00:48:13,880 --> 00:48:15,723
what went down with my wisdom teeth.

984
00:48:15,880 --> 00:48:17,211
- Shit.
- Damn.

985
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:18,967
Truth or dare?

986
00:48:19,320 --> 00:48:20,321
Dare.

987
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:22,369
Why would you choose dare?

988
00:48:22,520 --> 00:48:23,806
Hmm...

989
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:27,281
I dare you

990
00:48:29,880 --> 00:48:31,041
to shoot your friend.

991
00:48:33,320 --> 00:48:34,446
You jokin'.

992
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:35,971
She's jokin'.

993
00:48:37,840 --> 00:48:39,365
You know she's jokin', right?

994
00:48:39,560 --> 00:48:40,766
<i>ANNA". I'm not joking.</i>

995
00:48:41,160 --> 00:48:43,288
That's $10,000.

996
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:47,001
What?

997
00:48:47,160 --> 00:48:48,207
<i>Hey.</i>

998
00:48:52,160 --> 00:48:54,447
Show us what it looks like

999
00:48:54,600 --> 00:48:56,841
to see a man's brains explode.

1000
00:48:58,440 --> 00:48:59,646
Hey-

1001
00:49:00,200 --> 00:49:02,328
Fuck it! He ain't my friend.

1002
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:05,211
Hey! Fuck. Yo, Hi-C!

1003
00:49:06,680 --> 00:49:09,126
Don't let white girl tear us apart, Hi-C.

1004
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:11,800
This is fuckin' black-on-black violence.
This is how it happens.

1005
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:15,130
Don't fuckin'
let Anna Faris tear us apart!

1006
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:18,204
Yes, come on.
Show us what death looks like.

1007
00:49:19,520 --> 00:49:21,124
<i>Come on.</i>

1008
00:49:21,560 --> 00:49:23,881
Do it. Do it, do it, do it.

1009
00:49:24,040 --> 00:49:25,565
<i>Do it, do it, do it.</i>

1010
00:49:25,720 --> 00:49:27,290
Do it, do it.

1011
00:49:27,560 --> 00:49:28,561
<i>Do it!</i>

1012
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:30,166
Fuck that!

1013
00:49:30,680 --> 00:49:32,170
<i>The fuck is wrong with you?</i>

1014
00:49:32,360 --> 00:49:33,521
Get it, then!

1015
00:49:34,320 --> 00:49:36,561
- What?
- Get the cash, motherfucker!

1016
00:49:38,160 --> 00:49:40,447
You broke my nose!

1017
00:49:41,720 --> 00:49:43,051
Look, look, look!

1018
00:49:48,040 --> 00:49:50,247
You fucking peasant!

1019
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:53,686
Crazy bitch!

1020
00:49:55,760 --> 00:49:58,331
Bring your ass here, little Wendy!

1021
00:50:00,600 --> 00:50:01,965
Come on. Let's go!

1022
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:35,847
Move!

1023
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:37,445
Get in the back!

1024
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:39,207
Move it!

1025
00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:42,725
Drive!

1026
00:50:42,880 --> 00:50:44,484
<i>I gotta start the car.</i>

1027
00:50:46,240 --> 00:50:47,605
You good?

1028
00:50:50,920 --> 00:50:52,410
<i>Come on-Drive!</i>

1029
00:50:53,520 --> 00:50:55,170
I said drive, motherfucker!

1030
00:50:55,360 --> 00:50:56,407
I'm going, I'm going.

1031
00:50:56,560 --> 00:50:58,120
- Seat belts and shit!
- Come on, y'all.

1032
00:50:59,240 --> 00:51:01,322
What the fuck is y'all singing?

1033
00:51:01,480 --> 00:51:02,686
George Michael.

1034
00:51:03,400 --> 00:51:05,880
Shit, don't break the goddamn van.

1035
00:51:11,480 --> 00:51:14,927
- Oh, Stitches!
- No, no.

1036
00:51:15,080 --> 00:51:16,684
You ain't gonna hit nobody.

1037
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:17,881
Oh, there it goes!

1038
00:51:18,040 --> 00:51:19,246
<i>We still got this party shit</i>

1039
00:51:19,400 --> 00:51:20,686
<i>- goin' on later or what?
- Yeah.</i>

1040
00:51:20,840 --> 00:51:21,976
<i>We're going
downstairs in a second.</i>

1041
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:23,120
<i>Don't even worry about that.</i>

1042
00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:25,120
About time you passed that shit, eh?

1043
00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:26,536
Here's the thing, man. I was, like...

1044
00:51:26,560 --> 00:51:29,211
Just say some... Yeah, dawg?

1045
00:51:29,680 --> 00:51:32,650
Shark Tank, can I catch
your ear for a second?

1046
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:34,165
All right, dawg!

1047
00:51:34,360 --> 00:51:36,124
To be continued, y'all.

1048
00:51:36,320 --> 00:51:37,685
All right.

1049
00:51:37,840 --> 00:51:39,683
<i>- I'll be right back.
- Okay, Stitches.</i>

1050
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:41,729
Nah!

1051
00:51:42,600 --> 00:51:43,647
I gotta tell you, man,

1052
00:51:43,800 --> 00:51:46,849
I'm having an amazing time,
and these are not bad people.

1053
00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:49,202
Clarence, Clarence, they're bad people.

1054
00:51:49,360 --> 00:51:50,616
- No, no-
- They're very, very bad.

1055
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:52,136
Okay. They're drug dealers,
and I get all of that...

1056
00:51:52,160 --> 00:51:53,491
Listen to me. Listen to me.

1057
00:51:53,640 --> 00:51:55,216
- In the mansion, earlier...
- Yeah, yeah.

1058
00:51:55,240 --> 00:51:56,685
<i>Hey! Shark!</i>

1059
00:51:56,880 --> 00:51:58,689
Shark Tank! Come here!

1060
00:51:58,880 --> 00:52:00,564
Shut the fuck up, nigga.

1061
00:52:01,040 --> 00:52:02,690
Dumb motherfucker.

1062
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:04,696
Okay. We'll just have
a couple more drinks,

1063
00:52:04,720 --> 00:52:06,800
and then we'll just go see
where Cheddar's at, right?

1064
00:52:07,360 --> 00:52:09,010
I never get to go out. I never go out.

1065
00:52:09,160 --> 00:52:10,720
I am doing something that Hannah asked.

1066
00:52:10,840 --> 00:52:12,046
This is for my marriage.

1067
00:52:12,200 --> 00:52:13,964
These drinks are for my marriage.

1068
00:52:14,520 --> 00:52:15,726
Thank you. Thank you so much.

1069
00:52:15,880 --> 00:52:18,201
I cannot tell you how much
I appreciate that. All right.

1070
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:19,480
<i>Shark, you better hurry up!</i>

1071
00:52:19,560 --> 00:52:20,696
<i>CLARENCE". Listen up, niggas.</i>

1072
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:23,087
<i>BUD". We about to be out this motherfucker.</i>

1073
00:52:23,480 --> 00:52:24,720
- Oh!
- You good?

1074
00:52:29,720 --> 00:52:31,643
You got me on that one.

1075
00:52:34,160 --> 00:52:35,571
You good, though?

1076
00:52:36,920 --> 00:52:38,524
Yeah, I'm good.

1077
00:52:40,680 --> 00:52:42,250
You good?

1078
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:44,244
Yeah. I'm good.

1079
00:52:48,600 --> 00:52:50,921
Shit got crazy back there, huh?

1080
00:52:52,280 --> 00:52:54,487
You ain't never seen
nobody get killed before?

1081
00:52:54,720 --> 00:52:56,768
Me?

1082
00:52:56,920 --> 00:52:59,400
Yeah, I've seen people get killed before,

1083
00:52:59,560 --> 00:53:00,766
by me.

1084
00:53:02,600 --> 00:53:05,922
I was just trying to say that,
usually in Allentown,

1085
00:53:06,080 --> 00:53:08,924
we handle our business
a little bit more professionally.

1086
00:53:09,440 --> 00:53:11,602
Mmm-hmm. Okay.

1087
00:53:16,760 --> 00:53:17,966
You, uh...

1088
00:53:18,560 --> 00:53:20,483
You ever think about gettin' out the game?

1089
00:53:21,360 --> 00:53:22,407
No.

1090
00:53:24,200 --> 00:53:25,804
That's a shame.

1091
00:53:26,560 --> 00:53:30,884
I would imagine that
it's a tough job for a woman to be here.

1092
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:34,880
Not that you can't,

1093
00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:37,486
because a woman can do
anything a man can do, but...

1094
00:53:37,640 --> 00:53:38,846
Yeah.

1095
00:53:39,600 --> 00:53:40,880
You think if I get out the game,

1096
00:53:40,920 --> 00:53:43,366
niggas gonna stop thinkin'
they own bitches?

1097
00:53:45,120 --> 00:53:46,804
Well, I'm not like that.

1098
00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:49,641
You're not?

1099
00:53:49,800 --> 00:53:50,961
Nah.

1100
00:53:53,320 --> 00:53:55,561
I bet you, out there somewhere

1101
00:53:55,960 --> 00:53:59,407
there's a non-gangster motherfucker

1102
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:02,482
that'd be real lucky to have you.

1103
00:54:03,520 --> 00:54:04,851
I mean...

1104
00:54:06,840 --> 00:54:08,683
You look kind of like

1105
00:54:10,160 --> 00:54:12,162
the female lion in The Lion <i>King.</i>

1106
00:54:12,320 --> 00:54:13,367
Nala.

1107
00:54:13,560 --> 00:54:14,736
That's crazy that you say that,

1108
00:54:14,760 --> 00:54:16,296
because it's, like, my favorite cartoon.

1109
00:54:16,320 --> 00:54:18,322
- Really?
- Yeah, and I'm a Leo.

1110
00:54:18,520 --> 00:54:19,760
That's crazy how you knew that.

1111
00:54:19,800 --> 00:54:21,484
You must be psychic or somethin'.

1112
00:54:21,640 --> 00:54:23,563
Wow.

1113
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:30,880
You don't want to get mixed up
with a dude like me.

1114
00:54:31,040 --> 00:54:32,724
I'm a wanderer.

1115
00:54:32,880 --> 00:54:33,961
Oh, you gay.

1116
00:54:34,160 --> 00:54:35,685
- No.
- Yeah.

1117
00:54:35,840 --> 00:54:37,569
Why you think I'm gay, though?

1118
00:54:37,720 --> 00:54:39,210
I'm just messing with you, man.

1119
00:54:39,360 --> 00:54:40,885
I know you not gay.

1120
00:54:41,640 --> 00:54:43,210
How do you know?

1121
00:54:43,360 --> 00:54:45,249
I could tell you like girls.

1122
00:54:46,840 --> 00:54:48,001
Good.

1123
00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:51,521
I wanna thank you for earlier.

1124
00:54:52,280 --> 00:54:53,361
Really?

1125
00:54:54,680 --> 00:54:56,603
Like, for what?

1126
00:54:56,760 --> 00:54:58,171
For helping me kill those people.

1127
00:54:58,320 --> 00:54:59,526
Yeah. Well, I...

1128
00:54:59,680 --> 00:55:02,206
No. No. I...

1129
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:03,765
I ain't help you kill them people.

1130
00:55:03,920 --> 00:55:05,524
You did that on your own.

1131
00:55:05,680 --> 00:55:07,444
It's kind of like we killed them together.

1132
00:55:07,600 --> 00:55:12,891
Nah, I think it's more like
you murdered them on your own.

1133
00:55:13,560 --> 00:55:16,609
Mmm. But I couldn't have
done it without you.

1134
00:55:17,400 --> 00:55:21,450
Agree to disagree with that one.

1135
00:55:21,600 --> 00:55:23,523
We killed them together.

1136
00:55:24,520 --> 00:55:26,443
Well, legally speaking,

1137
00:55:27,520 --> 00:55:29,124
I did not help you.

1138
00:55:31,080 --> 00:55:32,241
Mmm...

1139
00:55:33,600 --> 00:55:34,761
You all right?

1140
00:55:34,920 --> 00:55:35,921
I didn't...

1141
00:55:36,600 --> 00:55:37,761
You was kind of close.

1142
00:55:37,920 --> 00:55:39,046
Yeah.

1143
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:41,126
Got my trick knee.

1144
00:55:41,280 --> 00:55:42,936
Why don't we go ahead
and finish this downstairs?

1145
00:55:42,960 --> 00:55:44,849
Mmm-hmm. You wanna... I go first.

1146
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:46,047
Yeah. Go on.

1147
00:55:46,560 --> 00:55:48,280
Come on, y'all.
Let's go to this party, man.

1148
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:49,840
- Hell, yeah.
- You heard her, y'all.

1149
00:55:49,880 --> 00:55:51,928
Niggas is in here caking and shit.

1150
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:36,482
Allentown!

1151
00:56:38,160 --> 00:56:39,650
Whoo!

1152
00:56:43,480 --> 00:56:46,131
Excuse me. Can I come
through here for a second?

1153
00:56:46,280 --> 00:56:47,850
Excuse me!

1154
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:51,206
- Hey!
- Hey, hey!

1155
00:56:51,800 --> 00:56:53,484
We said one drink!

1156
00:56:53,680 --> 00:56:55,682
Hey, but we're turning it out, man!

1157
00:56:55,840 --> 00:56:58,047
It's not "turn out," it's "turn up"!

1158
00:56:58,200 --> 00:56:59,964
And it's time to turn down, man!

1159
00:57:00,120 --> 00:57:01,531
On, hey, hey, hey!

1160
00:57:01,680 --> 00:57:03,887
Okay. I see what's going on.

1161
00:57:04,040 --> 00:57:06,202
You're just mad
because they like Shark Tank

1162
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:07,731
more than they like Techtonic!

1163
00:57:07,880 --> 00:57:09,166
What? No, no!

1164
00:57:09,360 --> 00:57:11,328
I'm sorry.
I just have a lot of personality.

1165
00:57:11,480 --> 00:57:12,936
I don't know what to tell you, brother.

1166
00:57:12,960 --> 00:57:14,803
- What?
- What?

1167
00:57:14,960 --> 00:57:17,247
First of all, I don't care

1168
00:57:17,400 --> 00:57:19,402
if they like Shark Tank
more than Techtonic.

1169
00:57:19,560 --> 00:57:21,050
They're murderers!

1170
00:57:21,680 --> 00:57:22,681
All right.

1171
00:57:22,840 --> 00:57:24,171
Second of all, no, they don't!

1172
00:57:24,320 --> 00:57:25,560
Yo, Tank!

1173
00:57:26,520 --> 00:57:27,726
What up?

1174
00:57:27,920 --> 00:57:29,206
Nah!

1175
00:57:31,800 --> 00:57:32,847
Yo, nigga, you aight?

1176
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:35,048
Word to Big Bird I'm aight, dawg. Blam!

1177
00:57:35,200 --> 00:57:36,201
<i>Aight, man.</i>

1178
00:57:36,360 --> 00:57:37,885
Hey, Stitches, man.

1179
00:57:38,040 --> 00:57:40,725
Let me show you how we
smoke weed in Allentown.

1180
00:57:47,440 --> 00:57:48,930
Aight.

1181
00:57:49,080 --> 00:57:51,606
That's my boy, right there.
He know how to do it right.

1182
00:57:51,760 --> 00:57:53,728
- Yo, Shark Tank!
- Yeah, dawg?

1183
00:57:53,880 --> 00:57:56,087
Your turn, my nigga!

1184
00:57:57,400 --> 00:57:58,890
Well, you know,

1185
00:57:59,040 --> 00:58:01,725
I'm more one of them
pipe-smokin' niggas, you know.

1186
00:58:01,880 --> 00:58:03,086
You say a Pipe?

1187
00:58:03,240 --> 00:58:04,241
- Thank God.
- Yeah.

1188
00:58:04,400 --> 00:58:06,926
Thank you so much, sir. Thank you. Yeah.

1189
00:58:07,080 --> 00:58:08,127
Here we go.

1190
00:58:11,240 --> 00:58:12,241
Yeah.

1191
00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:14,243
Gonna heat it up. Heat it on up.

1192
00:58:14,920 --> 00:58:17,241
Ooh. It's gonna be delicious.

1193
00:58:19,640 --> 00:58:21,404
Yeah-.

1194
00:58:21,600 --> 00:58:25,207
Yo, I almost forgot.

1195
00:58:25,480 --> 00:58:26,845
Just got this done out back.

1196
00:58:27,040 --> 00:58:28,883
Oh...

1197
00:58:29,560 --> 00:58:30,721
- Shit!
- Shit!

1198
00:58:30,880 --> 00:58:33,611
That's actually the best tattoo
I've ever seen in my life!

1199
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:34,841
Me, too, man. Me, too.

1200
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:36,331
You want some, dawg?

1201
00:58:36,640 --> 00:58:39,610
Nah. I don't fuck with that Holy Shit.

1202
00:58:39,760 --> 00:58:40,841
<i>Yo, you all right?</i>

1203
00:58:42,760 --> 00:58:44,285
- Hey, man.
- Help him!

1204
00:58:45,240 --> 00:58:47,641
- Holy shit!
- Holy shit!

1205
00:58:47,800 --> 00:58:49,290
Holy shit.

1206
00:58:49,440 --> 00:58:51,442
Shit!

1207
00:58:51,600 --> 00:58:52,726
Holy shit!

1208
00:58:52,920 --> 00:58:54,440
All right. You doin' all right, right?

1209
00:58:55,320 --> 00:58:56,845
Holy shit.

1210
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:59,321
I think maybe we should go,
like, lay down somewhere.

1211
00:59:04,960 --> 00:59:07,406
<i>Yo, nigga, you floatin'!</i>

1212
00:59:32,320 --> 00:59:33,890
Am I in Heaven?

1213
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:56,809
You're George Michael.

1214
00:59:57,400 --> 00:59:59,641
You're George Michael, man.

1215
01:00:01,120 --> 01:00:04,010
No. That's my favorite fucking song.

1216
01:00:12,840 --> 01:00:14,320
That's it. I like when you do that...

1217
01:00:14,440 --> 01:00:16,408
That thing. That leg thing. That's my jam.

1218
01:00:21,520 --> 01:00:23,727
Oh, no, I can't.
There's no way I can spin.

1219
01:00:23,880 --> 01:00:25,405
No, I can't do it.

1220
01:00:25,600 --> 01:00:27,090
What? Oh... There it is.

1221
01:00:29,880 --> 01:00:31,245
Oh, it's so good.

1222
01:00:36,760 --> 01:00:38,364
George.

1223
01:00:38,520 --> 01:00:40,010
<i>I have faith.</i>

1224
01:00:43,200 --> 01:00:44,565
Hello?

1225
01:00:49,600 --> 01:00:50,681
Oh.

1226
01:00:50,840 --> 01:00:53,081
Hello, Clarence. It's me,

1227
01:00:53,400 --> 01:00:54,561
Keanu.

1228
01:00:54,720 --> 01:00:55,721
Meow.

1229
01:00:55,920 --> 01:00:57,126
Wait.

1230
01:00:58,200 --> 01:00:59,247
Are you...

1231
01:01:00,040 --> 01:01:02,520
<i>- Keanu Reeves?</i>

1232
01:01:02,920 --> 01:01:03,967
<i>KEANU'. Yeah.</i>

1233
01:01:04,120 --> 01:01:06,248
I'm your spirit teacher.

1234
01:01:06,400 --> 01:01:09,006
People can't be excellent to you

1235
01:01:09,160 --> 01:01:12,562
unless you're being excellent to yourself.

1236
01:01:12,960 --> 01:01:14,560
I don't understand. What does that mean?

1237
01:01:14,640 --> 01:01:15,721
Clarence,

1238
01:01:15,880 --> 01:01:17,882
it's time to wake up.

1239
01:01:18,040 --> 01:01:22,841
Where you go from there
is a choice I leave to you.

1240
01:01:23,280 --> 01:01:25,442
On. Right.

1241
01:01:25,600 --> 01:01:27,170
<i>The Matrix.</i>

1242
01:01:27,320 --> 01:01:29,846
Dude, all you need to remember is...

1243
01:01:32,920 --> 01:01:35,082
on...

1244
01:01:35,920 --> 01:01:37,206
<i>I get it.</i>

1245
01:01:54,640 --> 01:01:56,210
Oh, let me get a picture...

1246
01:01:57,760 --> 01:01:58,966
Hannah!

1247
01:01:59,120 --> 01:02:00,167
Hi!

1248
01:02:00,560 --> 01:02:01,800
Hannah! <i>Baby.</i>

1249
01:02:01,960 --> 01:02:02,961
Hi, baby.

1250
01:02:03,120 --> 01:02:05,009
Oh, I miss you so much, baby.

1251
01:02:05,160 --> 01:02:06,366
How are you?

1252
01:02:06,760 --> 01:02:08,000
<i>Not good.</i>

1253
01:02:08,200 --> 01:02:09,440
Wait, where are you?

1254
01:02:09,960 --> 01:02:12,122
Oh, God. Oh... Huh?

1255
01:02:12,280 --> 01:02:14,089
What? No. I'm just outwith Rell.

1256
01:02:14,240 --> 01:02:15,321
<i>I'm doing me!</i>

1257
01:02:15,480 --> 01:02:17,642
- Are you at a club?
- Yeah.

1258
01:02:17,800 --> 01:02:20,531
In fact, it's of the strip club variety,

1259
01:02:20,680 --> 01:02:22,409
and I've never done that,

1260
01:02:22,560 --> 01:02:25,643
and I'm just having some
really rugged fun, you know?

1261
01:02:25,840 --> 01:02:29,049
So, you're at a strip club
having rugged fun.

1262
01:02:29,200 --> 01:02:31,009
Yeah. No, it's not like that.

1263
01:02:31,160 --> 01:02:33,811
It's not about the degrading
of women or anything.

1264
01:02:33,960 --> 01:02:35,689
I'm here for a very specific reason.

1265
01:02:35,840 --> 01:02:38,081
<i>And... No, that didn't sound right.</i>

1266
01:02:38,240 --> 01:02:39,287
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

1267
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:41,001
It's complicated.

1268
01:02:41,160 --> 01:02:42,336
I'll explain it to you tomorrow.

1269
01:02:42,360 --> 01:02:43,800
But it's all good. It's nothing bad.

1270
01:02:43,880 --> 01:02:45,689
Okay. Okay. Whatever.

1271
01:02:45,840 --> 01:02:46,841
But, baby...

1272
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:49,048
This is what you said you wanted, right?

1273
01:02:49,240 --> 01:02:50,685
You said to have fun.

1274
01:02:50,840 --> 01:02:52,360
<i>HANNAH". Whatever, Clarence. Whatever.</i>

1275
01:02:52,400 --> 01:02:55,324
<i>I just didn't think that
being in a strip club was your thing.</i>

1276
01:02:55,480 --> 01:02:58,006
Yeah, well, you know... Shit. I mean...

1277
01:02:58,160 --> 01:03:00,208
What'd you think my idea
of fun was, right?

1278
01:03:00,360 --> 01:03:02,567
It ain't like my fuckin'
lifestyle is some secret.

1279
01:03:02,720 --> 01:03:04,688
Why are you talking to me like that?

1280
01:03:04,880 --> 01:03:06,564
- See about it, then.
- What?

1281
01:03:06,760 --> 01:03:08,480
I said, why are you
talking to me like that?

1282
01:03:08,520 --> 01:03:10,727
I've never heard you
talk to me like that before.

1283
01:03:10,880 --> 01:03:13,087
I mean... I talk like that sometimes.

1284
01:03:13,240 --> 01:03:15,083
Yeah. All right. Okay.

1285
01:03:15,240 --> 01:03:16,685
Wait, what's wrong?

1286
01:03:16,840 --> 01:03:18,410
This is what you asked for, right?

1287
01:03:18,600 --> 01:03:21,046
Fine. I'm fine. Everything's fine.

1288
01:03:21,200 --> 01:03:22,376
I didn't want to ruin your weekend.

1289
01:03:22,400 --> 01:03:23,401
I just want you to know

1290
01:03:23,560 --> 01:03:25,688
that Spencer's been
a little inappropriate,

1291
01:03:25,840 --> 01:03:28,684
and I'm coming home tomorrow morning
instead of tomorrow night.

1292
01:03:29,240 --> 01:03:30,924
Inappropriate?

1293
01:03:32,800 --> 01:03:34,609
Spencer was inappropriate how?

1294
01:03:34,760 --> 01:03:36,569
<i>Let's just say
he made me uncomfortable.</i>

1295
01:03:36,720 --> 01:03:38,563
<i>I can't get into it right now.</i>

1296
01:03:38,720 --> 01:03:40,245
Baby, I gotta go.

1297
01:03:40,400 --> 01:03:42,562
You better behave yourself, too. Bye.

1298
01:03:42,720 --> 01:03:44,056
No, Hannah, please
don't hang up the phone.

1299
01:03:44,080 --> 01:03:45,776
Can you just explain to me
what's going on right now?

1300
01:03:45,800 --> 01:03:47,290
Hannah!

1301
01:03:47,440 --> 01:03:48,771
Hannah!

1302
01:03:48,920 --> 01:03:50,570
<i>TRUNK". Yo, this party is crazy!</i>

1303
01:03:51,800 --> 01:03:52,801
Oh.

1304
01:03:53,760 --> 01:03:55,330
Hey.

1305
01:03:56,720 --> 01:03:57,801
You aight?

1306
01:03:58,600 --> 01:04:00,045
Yeah, nigga. Yeah.

1307
01:04:00,200 --> 01:04:02,248
You know, just side bitch.

1308
01:04:02,800 --> 01:04:03,926
Word, uh...

1309
01:04:04,280 --> 01:04:07,090
Well, Cheddar wants to holla at you.

1310
01:04:07,280 --> 01:04:08,520
Cool, yeah.

1311
01:04:09,600 --> 01:04:11,762
I'll let him know you're coming.

1312
01:04:16,760 --> 01:04:18,125
<i>CHEDDAR'. SO, uh...</i>

1313
01:04:18,760 --> 01:04:21,764
Hi-C tells me
y'all some bad motherfuckers.

1314
01:04:21,960 --> 01:04:24,566
Even taught my goons some new tricks.

1315
01:04:25,760 --> 01:04:29,321
Yeah, we taught them
how we do things in Allentown.

1316
01:04:29,800 --> 01:04:31,211
<i>CHEDDAR'. Yeah, Well, um...</i>

1317
01:04:31,360 --> 01:04:34,204
I got a big exchange tomorrow. I need you.

1318
01:04:34,520 --> 01:04:36,966
<i>Help keep shit 100.
You know what I'm saying?</i>

1319
01:04:37,120 --> 01:04:38,690
After that,

1320
01:04:39,200 --> 01:04:41,806
- New Jack here is yours.
<i>- Um...</i>

1321
01:04:42,840 --> 01:04:46,481
I think we'd prefer to stick
to the original arrangement.

1322
01:04:46,640 --> 01:04:47,971
You know what I'm saying?

1323
01:04:49,080 --> 01:04:50,491
Okay, I see.

1324
01:04:51,480 --> 01:04:52,925
Driving up the price.

1325
01:04:53,480 --> 01:04:55,642
Okay, 10 G's plus New Jack.

1326
01:04:56,760 --> 01:04:57,886
Nah.

1327
01:04:58,280 --> 01:04:59,441
<i>Cheddar.</i>

1328
01:04:59,800 --> 01:05:01,211
<i>We just want the cat.</i>

1329
01:05:01,760 --> 01:05:04,684
Shark Tank and I,
we getting a little sleepy.

1330
01:05:05,440 --> 01:05:06,441
Sleepy?

1331
01:05:06,600 --> 01:05:09,490
Hell, yeah, nigga, we sleepy.

1332
01:05:10,480 --> 01:05:12,528
And when them Allentown niggas get tired,

1333
01:05:12,720 --> 01:05:14,290
we gotta catch some Z's,

1334
01:05:14,440 --> 01:05:17,205
or else Allentown niggas get cranky.

1335
01:05:19,200 --> 01:05:20,247
20.

1336
01:05:21,720 --> 01:05:23,165
<i>Straight up.</i>

1337
01:05:23,320 --> 01:05:26,449
Now, I know y'all ain't
gonna turn down 20 G's.

1338
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:28,047
I mean, shit.

1339
01:05:28,200 --> 01:05:31,204
That's a lot of money even by
Allentown standards, right?

1340
01:05:31,880 --> 01:05:32,881
Well...

1341
01:05:33,040 --> 01:05:35,646
Let me tell you about Allentown standards.

1342
01:05:37,560 --> 01:05:39,961
By Allentown standards,

1343
01:05:40,160 --> 01:05:41,730
when a nigga make a deal,

1344
01:05:43,040 --> 01:05:45,407
a nigga make a goddamn deal.

1345
01:05:45,920 --> 01:05:46,967
Ooh... Shark...

1346
01:05:47,120 --> 01:05:49,566
And didn't nobody say nothing

1347
01:05:49,720 --> 01:05:52,530
<i>about no exchange tomorrow.</i>

1348
01:05:53,400 --> 01:05:56,290
So, let me tell you
how it's gonna go down.

1349
01:05:57,240 --> 01:06:00,084
You gonna give us our goddamn cat,

1350
01:06:00,240 --> 01:06:04,086
and we gonna be on our
goddamn way, Spencer!

1351
01:06:04,240 --> 01:06:05,526
Uh, Cheddar.

1352
01:06:09,440 --> 01:06:11,761
Take pimpin' upstairs
to the office for me.

1353
01:06:11,920 --> 01:06:14,764
- Give him some of that catnip he like.
- Mmm-hmm.

1354
01:06:18,840 --> 01:06:20,046
You know, um,

1355
01:06:21,680 --> 01:06:23,330
maybe, just maybe,

1356
01:06:23,480 --> 01:06:25,767
just take a little time
to think about my offer.

1357
01:06:25,960 --> 01:06:27,849
We don't need time. We need...

1358
01:06:28,040 --> 01:06:29,087
Time is good.

1359
01:06:29,240 --> 01:06:31,242
We need some time. You need some time.

1360
01:06:31,400 --> 01:06:33,209
We'll take some. You take some.

1361
01:06:33,360 --> 01:06:36,409
You do it here. We'll do it over here.

1362
01:06:38,600 --> 01:06:40,409
- What are you doing?
- What am I doing?

1363
01:06:40,560 --> 01:06:42,056
This motherfucker trying to side wind us.

1364
01:06:42,080 --> 01:06:43,376
What the fuck are you doing, Tech?

1365
01:06:43,400 --> 01:06:45,767
I'm not Tech. I'm not Tech.
I'm Rell. Clarence.

1366
01:06:45,920 --> 01:06:47,604
Well, I was staying in character.

1367
01:06:47,760 --> 01:06:50,570
What are you, Daniel Day-Lewis
all of a sudden? Come on, man!

1368
01:06:50,720 --> 01:06:52,609
Look, I spoke to Hannah on the phone,

1369
01:06:52,760 --> 01:06:55,331
- and she said that Spencer did something.
- What?

1370
01:06:55,480 --> 01:06:57,040
She wouldn't tell me, man. She hung up!

1371
01:06:57,080 --> 01:06:58,081
Okay...

1372
01:06:58,280 --> 01:07:00,965
it can't be that bad if she didn't say.

1373
01:07:02,440 --> 01:07:05,489
You almost got us killed, man, okay?

1374
01:07:05,640 --> 01:07:07,290
Look, Keanu needs you.

1375
01:07:07,440 --> 01:07:09,807
I need you. I need you.

1376
01:07:11,800 --> 01:07:12,961
- Okay?
- Yeah.

1377
01:07:13,120 --> 01:07:14,281
Okay. Then come on.

1378
01:07:14,440 --> 01:07:15,601
Okay. I'm good. I'm good.

1379
01:07:15,800 --> 01:07:17,802
All right. Let's get Keanu.
Let's get out of here.

1380
01:07:17,960 --> 01:07:19,007
Yes.

1381
01:07:29,680 --> 01:07:31,682
Watch the door. Keanu!

1382
01:07:32,120 --> 01:07:33,360
Keanu!

1383
01:07:37,920 --> 01:07:39,649
I said I was gonna take care of you.

1384
01:07:42,840 --> 01:07:44,569
But I'm here now.

1385
01:07:45,800 --> 01:07:46,961
Get that off you.

1386
01:07:47,160 --> 01:07:48,810
I'm here for you, buddy.

1387
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:50,411
I love you.

1388
01:07:53,920 --> 01:07:55,081
Okay.

1389
01:07:55,400 --> 01:07:57,084
All right, go, go, go. Just walk.

1390
01:07:57,240 --> 01:07:58,810
I see. I get it now,

1391
01:07:58,960 --> 01:08:00,296
because when I stand up for myself,

1392
01:08:00,320 --> 01:08:01,816
that means I'm standing up
for Hannah and Belle,

1393
01:08:01,840 --> 01:08:03,016
and when I don't stand up for myself,

1394
01:08:03,040 --> 01:08:04,200
I'm not standing up for them.

1395
01:08:04,240 --> 01:08:07,005
Clarence, you can keep on talking,
but just know, I think we just won.

1396
01:08:07,520 --> 01:08:08,521
Oh.

1397
01:08:08,680 --> 01:08:10,170
Oh, my gosh, you're right.

1398
01:08:10,320 --> 01:08:11,731
Gosh, that was so weird, wasn't it?

1399
01:08:11,880 --> 01:08:13,560
I mean, we just walked right out of there.

1400
01:08:27,200 --> 01:08:28,440
Biscuits.

1401
01:08:32,960 --> 01:08:34,041
Hey, buddy.

1402
01:08:34,200 --> 01:08:35,281
Hey-

1403
01:08:42,520 --> 01:08:45,364
Oh... Fuck me.

1404
01:08:45,520 --> 01:08:46,601
What?

1405
01:08:46,880 --> 01:08:48,405
Oh, you know what?

1406
01:08:48,600 --> 01:08:50,136
Guess you don't know who you messing with

1407
01:08:50,160 --> 01:08:52,640
because you being
crazy disrespectful right now.

1408
01:08:52,800 --> 01:08:55,963
Hey! If you fucking touch
one hair on my cat's head,

1409
01:08:56,120 --> 01:08:57,167
I will kill you!

1410
01:08:57,800 --> 01:09:00,406
- Help!
- Never mind.

1411
01:09:01,920 --> 01:09:03,251
<i>Okay, yes, yes.</i>

1412
01:09:03,960 --> 01:09:05,536
Putting them down. Putting the guns down.

1413
01:09:05,560 --> 01:09:07,016
Yes, that's good.
Yes, thank you, thank you!

1414
01:09:07,040 --> 01:09:08,087
<i>- Hey.
- Thank you.</i>

1415
01:09:09,880 --> 01:09:11,564
- They like Keanu.
- That's good.

1416
01:09:11,720 --> 01:09:13,882
<i>We do, too.
We like Keanu as well.</i>

1417
01:09:14,080 --> 01:09:15,730
Everybody here seems to like Keanu,

1418
01:09:15,920 --> 01:09:18,241
so we can agree on that, right, guys?

1419
01:09:18,400 --> 01:09:20,164
Hey, we're fun dudes. We're friends!

1420
01:09:20,320 --> 01:09:22,561
<i>Please!
What do you want from us?</i>

1421
01:09:22,760 --> 01:09:24,603
- Oh, <i>God!</i>
- Oh, fuck.

1422
01:09:24,800 --> 01:09:26,245
Oh, my God. Are those tiny penises?

1423
01:09:26,400 --> 01:09:27,447
RELLI No!

1424
01:09:27,640 --> 01:09:30,166
Please, Lord, let those be fingers.

1425
01:09:30,320 --> 01:09:32,096
They're fucking fingers, man.
They're fucking fingers.

1426
01:09:32,120 --> 01:09:33,406
Oh, my <i>God!</i>

1427
01:09:37,240 --> 01:09:38,844
Hey! Listen, if you let us go,

1428
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:40,416
I might be able to get you visitor passes

1429
01:09:40,440 --> 01:09:42,681
to a meeting of the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee

1430
01:09:42,840 --> 01:09:44,096
if they're not in a closed session!

1431
01:09:44,120 --> 01:09:45,121
Oh, my gosh!

1432
01:09:49,560 --> 01:09:50,607
That just worked.

1433
01:09:50,760 --> 01:09:53,286
I don't fucking know how that worked.

1434
01:09:53,440 --> 01:09:54,771
I have a friend.
<i>I</i> have a friend.

1435
01:09:54,960 --> 01:09:56,936
A friend of mine went to grade
school with the speechwriter

1436
01:09:56,960 --> 01:09:59,008
<i>for John Kerry, a former
presidential candidate.</i>

1437
01:09:59,160 --> 01:10:00,600
Oh, my God. I think this is working.

1438
01:10:00,680 --> 01:10:02,170
<i>- No.
- Why would this be working?</i>

1439
01:10:02,320 --> 01:10:05,881
I think that they
are going to murder us to death!

1440
01:10:06,040 --> 01:10:07,201
On, my <i>God!</i>

1441
01:10:07,360 --> 01:10:09,362
Lord save me now, please!

1442
01:10:09,520 --> 01:10:10,965
Oh, fuck.

1443
01:10:14,840 --> 01:10:15,841
Keanu.

1444
01:10:18,880 --> 01:10:20,962
No! What is that one?

1445
01:10:22,040 --> 01:10:24,327
- Why are you doing this?
- Buddy“.

1446
01:10:24,480 --> 01:10:26,687
<i>Gentlemen, please,
why can't we just talk about this?</i>

1447
01:10:26,840 --> 01:10:27,966
<i>Can't we just...</i>

1448
01:10:28,160 --> 01:10:29,161
Okay, ready?

1449
01:10:29,320 --> 01:10:30,360
Just <i>take</i> a <i>deep</i> breath...

1450
01:10:30,480 --> 01:10:31,481
Get that bitch!

1451
01:10:33,280 --> 01:10:34,520
Get that bitch!

1452
01:10:35,480 --> 01:10:37,528
Get that bitch.

1453
01:10:37,680 --> 01:10:39,250
Yeah, get that bitch!

1454
01:10:41,960 --> 01:10:43,530
Get that, bitch!

1455
01:10:45,320 --> 01:10:47,004
No, not the fucking knife.

1456
01:10:47,160 --> 01:10:48,207
Man.

1457
01:10:48,360 --> 01:10:49,521
<i>I'm saying...</i>

1458
01:10:49,720 --> 01:10:50,926
I don't know what I'm saying.

1459
01:10:51,080 --> 01:10:54,004
I don't know... Wait, wait, wait.
I think we're gonna need more time.

1460
01:10:54,160 --> 01:10:55,376
Just give us a little bit more time.

1461
01:10:55,400 --> 01:10:57,687
Sir, I'm begging you, please.

1462
01:10:57,840 --> 01:10:59,736
<i>Think about, dig in to
yourselves, into your souls.</i>

1463
01:10:59,760 --> 01:11:01,842
Why would you have to
do something like this?

1464
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:03,001
Please, no.

1465
01:11:03,160 --> 01:11:04,491
Oh, God. Oh, God.

1466
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:06,240
On, my God.

1467
01:11:09,400 --> 01:11:11,004
<i>I</i> got you!

1468
01:11:11,200 --> 01:11:13,089
Yes!

1469
01:11:14,360 --> 01:11:15,691
Yes! Yes! Oh, God, yes!

1470
01:11:15,840 --> 01:11:17,524
<i>Yes, yes, yes. Oh, yes, Re“.</i>

1471
01:11:17,680 --> 01:11:19,160
- Back up!
- Thank you, God, for this!

1472
01:11:19,200 --> 01:11:20,531
Back up!

1473
01:11:20,680 --> 01:11:22,489
Okay. Yes. We gotcha!

1474
01:11:22,640 --> 01:11:24,688
Fucking got you, motherfucker!

1475
01:11:24,880 --> 01:11:27,008
Just don't move, all right?

1476
01:11:27,160 --> 01:11:29,401
We're gonna take our cat,
and we're gonna be on our way!

1477
01:11:29,560 --> 01:11:31,005
- If you don't mind.
- Keanu!

1478
01:11:31,160 --> 01:11:32,207
- Keanu!
- Keanu!

1479
01:11:32,840 --> 01:11:33,921
CLARENCE; Keanu!

1480
01:11:34,560 --> 01:11:35,891
Keanu!

1481
01:11:36,040 --> 01:11:37,724
Drop the fucking... Hey, back up!

1482
01:11:37,880 --> 01:11:39,689
What are you doing? Stop moving forward!

1483
01:11:39,840 --> 01:11:40,887
<i>Stop walking!</i>

1484
01:11:41,040 --> 01:11:42,087
<i>Stop walking toward us!</i>

1485
01:11:42,240 --> 01:11:43,401
Stay right there!

1486
01:11:43,560 --> 01:11:44,760
<i>Why are you walking toward us?</i>

1487
01:11:44,840 --> 01:11:46,046
<i>Why are you walking toward us?</i>

1488
01:11:46,200 --> 01:11:47,770
Hey, knock it off! Knock it off!

1489
01:11:47,920 --> 01:11:50,287
<i>We will fire these guns and
shoot bullets into your body.</i>

1490
01:11:50,440 --> 01:11:52,522
Count of three.
We gotta fucking shoot them.

1491
01:11:52,680 --> 01:11:54,569
I can't shoot them!
I will not kill somebody.

1492
01:11:54,720 --> 01:11:56,480
- Clarence, we gotta do it!
- I cannot do it!

1493
01:11:56,560 --> 01:11:57,607
Okay, one...

1494
01:12:08,160 --> 01:12:09,241
I said the count of three.

1495
01:12:09,400 --> 01:12:10,526
I know. I'm sorry.

1496
01:12:10,720 --> 01:12:12,576
- I said the count of three.
- I heard you say...

1497
01:12:12,600 --> 01:12:14,125
- Yeah.
- I heard it. Oh, my God!

1498
01:12:14,280 --> 01:12:15,611
We've killed people!

1499
01:12:15,760 --> 01:12:17,000
"Well?

1500
01:12:17,160 --> 01:12:18,400
Why "we"? No, you did it!

1501
01:12:18,600 --> 01:12:20,045
- What, no!
- I didn't shoot anybody.

1502
01:12:32,440 --> 01:12:33,726
Okay.

1503
01:12:34,080 --> 01:12:35,520
Okay, we just murdered those people.

1504
01:12:35,600 --> 01:12:36,880
- That's okay. All right.
- Okay.

1505
01:12:36,920 --> 01:12:39,764
- We should go. We should go.
- Ah...

1506
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:41,331
Keanu!

1507
01:12:41,480 --> 01:12:42,811
Here, kitty, kitty!

1508
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:44,206
Oh, God.

1509
01:12:44,360 --> 01:12:45,964
Uh... Kitty, kitty!

1510
01:12:46,760 --> 01:12:48,285
Keanu!

1511
01:13:05,560 --> 01:13:07,688
Thought y'all motherfuckers was dead.

1512
01:13:08,480 --> 01:13:10,721
<i>Didn't say goodbye or nothing.</i>

1513
01:13:10,880 --> 01:13:12,723
Oh, and my cat, New Jack?

1514
01:13:12,880 --> 01:13:16,009
<i>The one I would never give up
to two niggas like y'all?</i>

1515
01:13:16,200 --> 01:13:17,770
<i>He was gone, too.</i>

1516
01:13:17,920 --> 01:13:20,048
And now I see that you are, in fact,

1517
01:13:20,200 --> 01:13:22,806
holding that nigga New Jack as we speak.

1518
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:24,240
Hi-C,

1519
01:13:24,640 --> 01:13:26,085
get my cat.

1520
01:13:32,440 --> 01:13:34,010
<i>HULKA". Hey, hey, you two!</i>

1521
01:13:34,920 --> 01:13:35,921
What's that?

1522
01:13:36,080 --> 01:13:37,161
That?

1523
01:13:38,440 --> 01:13:40,010
That's just a nigga in the trunk, man.

1524
01:13:40,160 --> 01:13:41,605
What you think?

1525
01:13:41,760 --> 01:13:43,364
Because that's
how we roll, motherfucker.

1526
01:13:43,560 --> 01:13:44,607
That's our car.

1527
01:13:44,760 --> 01:13:46,683
We be putting niggas
in this trunk all the time.

1528
01:13:46,840 --> 01:13:49,002
This the last day this
motherfucker's alive, man.

1529
01:13:49,160 --> 01:13:50,336
<i>HULKA'. Oh, Shit! Don't kill me!</i>

1530
01:13:50,360 --> 01:13:51,805
<i>- Oh, Shit.
- What?</i>

1531
01:13:51,960 --> 01:13:53,007
Oh, Rell!

1532
01:13:53,160 --> 01:13:54,685
<i>Rel!'s cousin! Fuck!</i>

1533
01:13:54,840 --> 01:13:56,080
Make sure you got your keys.

1534
01:13:56,280 --> 01:13:57,486
Here's the deal, man.

1535
01:13:57,640 --> 01:13:59,688
This nigga right here? He stole your cat.

1536
01:13:59,840 --> 01:14:00,841
That's him.

1537
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:02,650
We just got your cat back for you.

1538
01:14:02,800 --> 01:14:04,131
<i>That is a hurtful lie!</i>

1539
01:14:04,280 --> 01:14:05,281
<i>Yo, Cheddar.</i>

1540
01:14:05,440 --> 01:14:06,441
That's Hulka.

1541
01:14:06,600 --> 01:14:09,000
<i>That's whose apartment that Trunk and Bud
stole the cat from.</i>

1542
01:14:09,120 --> 01:14:10,610
He probably tryin' to steal him back.

1543
01:14:10,760 --> 01:14:12,444
<i>Yo, it wasn't my place!
It was their place!</i>

1544
01:14:12,600 --> 01:14:13,896
<i>- There</i> you go.
- That's <i>what</i> happened.

1545
01:14:13,920 --> 01:14:15,729
Your girl know what's up.

1546
01:14:15,880 --> 01:14:17,280
Give me the keys. Give me the keys.

1547
01:14:17,360 --> 01:14:19,010
You don't need to...

1548
01:14:19,640 --> 01:14:20,641
<i>Cheddar. Look,</i>

1549
01:14:20,800 --> 01:14:21,936
<i>I don't even know if you remember this.</i>

1550
01:14:21,960 --> 01:14:24,042
I met you at the club once. Hulka. Hulka.

1551
01:14:24,200 --> 01:14:25,201
<i>Look, come on, man...</i>

1552
01:14:25,360 --> 01:14:26,361
Kill this motherfucker.

1553
01:14:26,560 --> 01:14:28,688
- What? No! Come on, man!
- Kill him?

1554
01:14:28,840 --> 01:14:31,161
Like, end his life so
the motherfucker expires?

1555
01:14:31,360 --> 01:14:32,691
Take the soul out of his body?

1556
01:14:32,840 --> 01:14:34,560
But we can't do that,
and I'll tell you why.

1557
01:14:34,640 --> 01:14:35,971
Because we don't have a gun.

1558
01:14:36,120 --> 01:14:37,560
- We ain't got no guns.
- That's why.

1559
01:14:37,640 --> 01:14:38,721
This...

1560
01:14:41,320 --> 01:14:43,448
- Thank you.
- Appreciate it.

1561
01:14:43,600 --> 01:14:45,216
- Thanks for the gun.
- I really appreciate it.

1562
01:14:45,240 --> 01:14:47,376
You looking out, and that's why
I respect you, Cheddar.

1563
01:14:47,400 --> 01:14:50,370
<i>That was
efficient as fuck. Um...</i>

1564
01:14:51,720 --> 01:14:53,404
Hey, you know what, Techtonic?

1565
01:14:53,560 --> 01:14:54,925
What's that?

1566
01:14:55,920 --> 01:14:57,365
Do the honors, dawg.

1567
01:14:59,360 --> 01:15:01,089
You one considerate motherfucker.

1568
01:15:01,240 --> 01:15:03,481
- I do what I can, dirt.
- Just do it!

1569
01:15:04,240 --> 01:15:05,810
<i>No, no, please don't!</i>

1570
01:15:05,960 --> 01:15:07,936
Don't kill me. Don't shoot me!
I don't want to die.

1571
01:15:07,960 --> 01:15:09,883
<i>Come on, I just want to build motorcycles,</i>

1572
01:15:10,040 --> 01:15:12,407
<i>and be a stunt man in my spare time, yo!</i>

1573
01:15:12,560 --> 01:15:14,608
<i>Oh, God, I didn't Want this.</i>

1574
01:15:14,840 --> 01:15:16,524
<i>[Rel], Rell.</i>

1575
01:15:17,160 --> 01:15:18,286
Come on, bro.

1576
01:15:20,400 --> 01:15:21,686
Fucking do it.

1577
01:15:23,440 --> 01:15:24,487
Can't do it!

1578
01:15:27,440 --> 01:15:29,966
And you have many more guns than I do.

1579
01:15:30,120 --> 01:15:31,884
So, I give you this one.

1580
01:15:32,040 --> 01:15:33,530
Y'all ain't from fuckin' Allentown.

1581
01:15:33,680 --> 01:15:34,841
Fuckin' knew it.

1582
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:36,411
In a sense,

1583
01:15:36,560 --> 01:15:38,767
aren't we all from Allentown?

1584
01:15:38,920 --> 01:15:42,447
George Michael is
a real nigga, though, right?

1585
01:15:42,640 --> 01:15:44,642
He's not black. I lied about that.

1586
01:15:44,800 --> 01:15:46,120
He is not black, and I apologize.

1587
01:15:46,160 --> 01:15:47,161
Nah!

1588
01:15:47,320 --> 01:15:49,163
And he probably
had a fuckin' father figure

1589
01:15:49,320 --> 01:15:50,731
the whole fuckin' time.

1590
01:15:52,160 --> 01:15:53,730
I can't speak to that.

1591
01:15:53,880 --> 01:15:55,056
<i>I don't know the man personally.</i>

1592
01:15:55,080 --> 01:15:56,605
Bitch, shut the fuck up!

1593
01:15:56,760 --> 01:15:57,886
You don't get to talk!

1594
01:15:58,640 --> 01:16:00,324
Y'all talk too damn much.

1595
01:16:00,680 --> 01:16:03,490
- I don't talk that much.
- What?

1596
01:16:04,160 --> 01:16:05,446
Take this nigga out.

1597
01:16:05,600 --> 01:16:06,931
<i>No! Please!</i>

1598
01:16:07,120 --> 01:16:08,960
Not in front of us.
Please, not in front of us.

1599
01:16:09,600 --> 01:16:10,647
Oh.

1600
01:16:10,800 --> 01:16:13,531
Just taking me out from the trunk?
Oh, thank you.

1601
01:16:14,280 --> 01:16:15,520
And put him in our trunk.

1602
01:16:15,680 --> 01:16:17,011
Aw, man.

1603
01:16:17,160 --> 01:16:18,207
Okay. Okay.

1604
01:16:18,360 --> 01:16:20,136
Well, anything better
than being shot, you heard?

1605
01:16:20,160 --> 01:16:22,845
Right? Oh, I stand corrected! No, no, no!

1606
01:16:23,640 --> 01:16:25,005
No, no, no!

1607
01:16:28,040 --> 01:16:29,246
No, no, no!

1608
01:16:29,400 --> 01:16:31,164
Oh, this is fucking gross!

1609
01:16:31,320 --> 01:16:32,924
Oh, this is fuckin'...

1610
01:16:36,640 --> 01:16:37,687
H U LKAI Motherfucker!

1611
01:16:37,840 --> 01:16:39,968
- So, my name is Rell.
- And I am Clarence.

1612
01:16:40,120 --> 01:16:41,246
Look.

1613
01:16:41,400 --> 01:16:43,209
You two morons is coming with us.

1614
01:16:43,360 --> 01:16:46,682
Allentown or not, y'all gonna
be my Allentown niggas today.

1615
01:16:47,560 --> 01:16:51,246
You do anything stupid,
and you're fuckin' dead.

1616
01:16:51,640 --> 01:16:52,641
- Okay.
- Yep.

1617
01:16:52,800 --> 01:16:54,360
That goes without saying at this point.

1618
01:16:54,400 --> 01:16:56,050
That gun is so close to my head.

1619
01:16:56,200 --> 01:16:57,725
Is that necessary?

1620
01:17:34,160 --> 01:17:36,606
Welcome to my home, guys. How you doing?

1621
01:17:36,760 --> 01:17:40,048
Anything? Beer, wine, liquor, girls?

1622
01:17:40,200 --> 01:17:41,247
Videogames?

1623
01:17:43,280 --> 01:17:44,327
No?

1624
01:17:44,760 --> 01:17:46,524
Bacon Diaz.

1625
01:17:47,760 --> 01:17:49,250
I heard you had a baller crib,

1626
01:17:49,400 --> 01:17:52,643
but this is practically
Neverland fuckin' Ranch out here.

1627
01:17:53,240 --> 01:17:55,481
Thank you. Thanks.

1628
01:17:55,640 --> 01:17:57,722
Who the fuck is...

1629
01:17:57,880 --> 01:17:59,086
That's them.

1630
01:17:59,240 --> 01:18:00,321
That's them?

1631
01:18:00,480 --> 01:18:02,323
<i>CHEDDAR". The Allentown niggas.</i>

1632
01:18:02,920 --> 01:18:04,410
<i>Los Phantomas?</i>

1633
01:18:04,960 --> 01:18:07,440
Yep. They the ones
that killed your cousin.

1634
01:18:08,480 --> 01:18:10,482
And we here to collect the bounty.

1635
01:18:10,640 --> 01:18:11,687
Wait...

1636
01:18:11,840 --> 01:18:14,081
No fuckin' way these guys
could be the Phantomas, man.

1637
01:18:14,240 --> 01:18:15,605
They're like shadows, man.

1638
01:18:15,760 --> 01:18:17,967
They're like the boogeyman
and shit, you know?

1639
01:18:18,120 --> 01:18:19,451
- No, you're right.
- Good eye.

1640
01:18:19,600 --> 01:18:21,728
But what happened was
I was trying to get my cat.

1641
01:18:21,920 --> 01:18:23,763
<i>- That's his cat.
- And his name is Keanu.</i>

1642
01:18:23,920 --> 01:18:24,960
<i>It's this cat right there!</i>

1643
01:18:25,080 --> 01:18:26,764
Iglesias?

1644
01:18:27,320 --> 01:18:29,288
That's my cousin's cat.

1645
01:18:30,040 --> 01:18:31,041
They took him?

1646
01:18:31,200 --> 01:18:32,486
Who? Who?

1647
01:18:32,680 --> 01:18:34,216
Oh, shit.
Somebody's getting an ass whippin'.

1648
01:18:34,240 --> 01:18:36,242
- Let's go. Come on!
- Yeah!

1649
01:18:36,840 --> 01:18:38,126
God damn right, they had him.

1650
01:18:38,280 --> 01:18:39,645
- We did not have him.
- No.

1651
01:18:39,800 --> 01:18:41,484
No, no, no. There's no way, sir.

1652
01:18:41,640 --> 01:18:43,240
That cat just was found on his doorstep.

1653
01:18:43,320 --> 01:18:44,481
That cat's name is Keanu.

1654
01:18:44,640 --> 01:18:46,416
- I know because I named him.
- And has been his for months.

1655
01:18:46,440 --> 01:18:47,760
It's too much of a coincidence...

1656
01:18:48,360 --> 01:18:49,600
So, it was them?

1657
01:18:49,760 --> 01:18:51,171
Shit, yeah, it was them.

1658
01:18:51,320 --> 01:18:52,845
No! No, it was not us.

1659
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:54,570
Do we got a deal or what?

1660
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:03,001
Deal.

1661
01:19:03,160 --> 01:19:04,161
Deal. Why is it a deal?

1662
01:19:04,320 --> 01:19:06,280
Don't make the deal,
because we're not those guys.

1663
01:19:06,400 --> 01:19:07,526
Show them.

1664
01:19:07,720 --> 01:19:09,165
Give me a second before I kill you.

1665
01:19:09,320 --> 01:19:11,687
On, God!

1666
01:19:11,840 --> 01:19:13,046
Come on, man!

1667
01:19:13,240 --> 01:19:15,561
<i>Why is everybody being hasty?</i>

1668
01:19:15,720 --> 01:19:17,131
Get Iglesias.

1669
01:19:18,960 --> 01:19:20,689
Whoa. Wait a minute.

1670
01:19:20,840 --> 01:19:22,808
I was thinking I would hold on to the cat.

1671
01:19:23,800 --> 01:19:25,723
Okay. See, there's a problem with that,

1672
01:19:25,880 --> 01:19:29,009
because Iglesias belongs to my family.

1673
01:19:29,360 --> 01:19:30,566
I wanna give him to my aunt,

1674
01:19:30,720 --> 01:19:32,656
so she can have something
to remember my cousin by.

1675
01:19:32,680 --> 01:19:33,681
<i>You know?</i>

1676
01:19:33,840 --> 01:19:35,922
<i>So, that's non-negotiable.</i>

1677
01:19:36,520 --> 01:19:38,204
Deal breaker.

1678
01:19:38,680 --> 01:19:39,920
Deal breaker.

1679
01:19:40,080 --> 01:19:41,366
Don't think too long, kid.

1680
01:19:41,520 --> 01:19:43,249
Don't think too long.

1681
01:19:45,640 --> 01:19:47,369
<i>Nght, Papi.</i>

1682
01:19:50,080 --> 01:19:51,445
Look here, man.

1683
01:19:53,200 --> 01:19:54,645
Oh, God.

1684
01:19:56,920 --> 01:19:58,126
Bottom line is...

1685
01:19:58,280 --> 01:19:59,361
Light this bitch up!

1686
01:20:27,040 --> 01:20:28,451
<i>Stitches!</i>

1687
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:30,411
You need help?

1688
01:20:30,560 --> 01:20:32,130
Nah!

1689
01:20:34,560 --> 01:20:36,244
Rell, Rell! Look, look!

1690
01:20:36,400 --> 01:20:37,811
They're communicating.

1691
01:20:38,640 --> 01:20:39,680
I'm out, I'm out, I'm out!

1692
01:20:39,800 --> 01:20:41,370
<i>I got you!</i>

1693
01:20:51,920 --> 01:20:52,967
Awesome!

1694
01:20:53,120 --> 01:20:54,929
I know. Yeah. Oh.

1695
01:21:01,600 --> 01:21:02,726
Hi-C!

1696
01:21:07,280 --> 01:21:08,884
Get the damn cat!

1697
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:11,809
<i>- Get the damn cat!
- Fuck!</i>

1698
01:21:20,440 --> 01:21:21,601
No, Rell! Whoa!

1699
01:21:22,600 --> 01:21:24,762
Hey! You will die!

1700
01:21:24,920 --> 01:21:26,604
Then get my back.

1701
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:19,525
Don't tell me you just tried to flip,

1702
01:22:19,680 --> 01:22:21,250
'cause you flopped, stupid!

1703
01:22:21,400 --> 01:22:22,526
Give me the cat.

1704
01:22:22,680 --> 01:22:24,205
- Give me the cat.
- No! Keanu!

1705
01:22:24,360 --> 01:22:25,361
Come on, Iglesias.

1706
01:22:25,520 --> 01:22:26,567
Who's going home?

1707
01:22:26,720 --> 01:22:28,643
Going home, home...

1708
01:22:29,200 --> 01:22:30,645
Rell... No! Why!

1709
01:22:30,840 --> 01:22:33,411
He's got Keanu!

1710
01:22:33,880 --> 01:22:35,166
Where'd he go?

1711
01:22:35,320 --> 01:22:36,401
Let's go.

1712
01:22:37,040 --> 01:22:39,088
I got you, Iglesias. Here we go. Okay.

1713
01:22:39,240 --> 01:22:40,600
Manny, open the car. Open the car.

1714
01:22:41,040 --> 01:22:42,087
I got Iglesias.

1715
01:22:42,720 --> 01:22:43,721
Go, go, go.

1716
01:22:43,880 --> 01:22:45,006
Where are you going?

1717
01:22:45,160 --> 01:22:46,889
- Your house!
- My house?

1718
01:22:48,640 --> 01:22:50,051
What are you doing?

1719
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:52,081
What? Rell!

1720
01:22:52,240 --> 01:22:54,561
Rell, you can't drive!

1721
01:22:56,080 --> 01:22:57,844
Unbelievable. What...

1722
01:23:16,760 --> 01:23:18,091
- I'll shoot you!
- Oh, fuck!

1723
01:23:18,240 --> 01:23:20,242
You ain't gonna fuckin' shoot the driver!

1724
01:23:20,400 --> 01:23:21,686
What are you doing?

1725
01:23:21,840 --> 01:23:22,887
Oh, shit!

1726
01:23:23,040 --> 01:23:24,610
Yeah, motherfucker!

Oh, fuck! Look out!

1728

Oh...

1773
01:26:08,880 --> 01:26:10,370
Keanu!

1774
01:26:11,880 --> 01:26:13,245
Oh, man.

1775
01:26:18,160 --> 01:26:19,446
Of course you're alive.

1776
01:26:22,200 --> 01:26:23,281
What?

1777
01:26:23,440 --> 01:26:25,807
You got a-fuckin'-nother gun in your ass?

1778
01:26:25,960 --> 01:26:27,246
What?

1779
01:26:29,880 --> 01:26:30,927
Shit!

1780
01:26:31,120 --> 01:26:34,886
Who the fuck taught you how to drive,
you bad-driving bitch?

1781
01:26:35,320 --> 01:26:36,924
I don't drive.

1782
01:26:39,800 --> 01:26:41,131

1783
01:26:43,440 --> 01:26:45,761

1785
01:26:51,320 --> 01:26:53,641
Clarence, you did it, man!
Fuck, you did it, cuz!

1786
01:26:53,800 --> 01:26:55,290
That was so fuckin' badass!

1787
01:26:55,480 --> 01:26:56,641
Oh, thanks, man.

1788
01:26:56,800 --> 01:26:59,121

- Keanu! Shit!

1789
01:26:59,600 --> 01:27:00,647
God, ow.

01:27:00,800 --> 01:27:02,643
What the fuck is wrong with you?

1791
01:27:02,800 --> 01:27:05,167
Trying to kill me with my kid's car!

1792
01:27:05,840 --> 01:27:07,251
No.

1793
01:27:07,760 --> 01:27:09,922
I'm unkillable.

1794
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:20,240
<i>CHEDDAR'. What the fuck?</i>

1795
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:24,368
Blips was supposed to run this game, man.

And y'all fuckin' ruined it.
Y'all fucked everything up.

01:27:33,440 --> 01:27:34,805
I still gotta get mines, though.

1801
01:27:34,960 --> 01:27:36,166

1802
01:27:36,320 --> 01:27:37,685

Trunk, drop it.

On the ground?

<i>All this Bliptown family shit?</i>

1819
01:28:17,040 --> 01:28:18,371
It's over.

1820
01:28:26,080 --> 01:28:27,525
Cheddar, you're under arrest.

1821
01:28:27,680 --> 01:28:29,364
Put your hands up.

1822
01:28:31,720 --> 01:28:33,563
I will shoot you.

1823
01:28:36,880 --> 01:28:39,008
Don't turn your back on me.

1824
01:28:40,880 --> 01:28:42,086
Fuck you, bitch!

<i>Now! On your knees!</i>

1832
01:29:12,760 --> 01:29:14,285
Keanu!

1833
01:29:20,600 --> 01:29:21,931
Go get him, Rell.

1834
01:29:22,120 --> 01:29:24,009
It's me. You all right?

1835
01:29:24,160 --> 01:29:26,049
Are you hurt? Are you hurt?

1836
01:29:32,320 --> 01:29:33,560
I love you.

1837
01:29:34,920 --> 01:29:36,570
We're gonna go home.

1838
01:29:39,280 --> 01:29:41,681
All right. We're good. We're gonna go.

1839
01:29:47,400 --> 01:29:48,401
What?

1840
01:29:48,560 --> 01:29:50,600
- Wait, no. Stay in the car!
- Why? What's going on?

1841
01:29:50,640 --> 01:29:52,496
Because there's a bunch
of dead people out here, that's why.

1842
01:29:52,520 --> 01:29:54,124
(%GROANS)

1843
01:29:54,320 --> 01:29:57,130
- Honey! You punched him in the face!
- Yeah.

1844
01:29:57,280 --> 01:29:58,400
You punched him in the face.

1845
01:29:58,520 --> 01:30:00,124
I need you to fuck me right now.

1846
01:30:00,280 --> 01:30:01,850
Okay. Stay in the car!

1847
01:30:02,040 --> 01:30:04,008
Right now. Stay in the car.

1848
01:30:04,160 --> 01:30:05,241
"Ch, yes!

1849
01:30:14,160 --> 01:30:15,844
Well, this was a fuckin' mess.

1850
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:17,161
Tell me about it.

1851
01:30:17,320 --> 01:30:18,845
Hey, I know you need this back.

1852
01:30:19,000 --> 01:30:20,286
He's keepin' his.

1853
01:30:20,440 --> 01:30:22,124
- Rell.
- You're doing good work.

1854
01:30:22,280 --> 01:30:24,521
We need to talk about
a few things before you go.

1855
01:30:24,680 --> 01:30:26,496
But first let me introduce you
to Officer Galloway

1856
01:30:26,520 --> 01:30:27,851
and Officer Dunn.

1857
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:29,445
Oh, snap!

1858
01:30:29,880 --> 01:30:31,644
Right. You're alive.

1859
01:30:31,800 --> 01:30:33,689
- Sorry about that.
- Yeah.

1860
01:30:33,840 --> 01:30:35,763
I had a fantastic time.

1861
01:30:36,240 --> 01:30:37,241
That's weird.

1862
01:30:37,400 --> 01:30:38,640
Mmm-hmm.

1863
01:30:38,840 --> 01:30:40,840
- What about Anna Faris?
- Well, she's still alive.

1864
01:30:40,920 --> 01:30:43,207
We hire celebrities all the time
to help us with cases.

1865
01:30:43,360 --> 01:30:45,169
Like Shaq or Steven Seagal.

1866
01:30:45,320 --> 01:30:46,845
No shit.

1867
01:30:47,040 --> 01:30:50,726
I'm gonna let you two
talk about that other thing.

1868
01:30:50,920 --> 01:30:52,046
Mmm.

1869
01:30:54,760 --> 01:30:56,489
"That other thing"?

1870
01:30:56,920 --> 01:30:58,922
Ooh. I like the sound of that.

1871
01:31:00,320 --> 01:31:03,722
So, what, do you need me for some kind of
top-secret mission or something?

1872
01:31:03,880 --> 01:31:06,804
No. No top-secret missions goin' on.

1873
01:31:06,960 --> 01:31:09,008
But we need to talk about your behavior.

1874
01:31:10,040 --> 01:31:11,724
You know I just wanted my cat back.

1875
01:31:11,880 --> 01:31:13,530
I know. And you got him.

1876
01:31:13,680 --> 01:31:15,444
Keanu's a cutie.

1877
01:31:17,360 --> 01:31:18,725
Damn, Hi-C.

1878
01:31:18,880 --> 01:31:20,882
Parker. Trina Parker.

1879
01:31:21,400 --> 01:31:23,004
Trina Parker.

1880
01:31:25,240 --> 01:31:26,571
I kind of liked Hi-C.

1881
01:31:26,720 --> 01:31:28,722
Well, she kind of liked you, too.

1882
01:31:31,120 --> 01:31:32,963
Well... OW.

1883
01:31:34,920 --> 01:31:36,445
Maybe we should go somewhere.

1884
01:31:38,760 --> 01:31:40,569
Maybe we should.

1885
01:31:40,760 --> 01:31:42,410
Right to jail.

1886
01:31:42,960 --> 01:31:44,450
Whoa...

1887
01:31:45,240 --> 01:31:46,321
Mmm-hmm.

1888
01:31:46,560 --> 01:31:48,130
That makes sense.

1889
01:31:48,280 --> 01:31:50,362
Broke a lot of laws, probably.

1890
01:31:50,560 --> 01:31:52,927
Don't worry. I'll testify on your behalf.

1891
01:31:53,080 --> 01:31:55,128
- Watch him for me?
- I will.

1892
01:31:56,200 --> 01:31:57,281
And just remember, Rell.

1893
01:31:57,440 --> 01:31:59,090
There's consequences to your actions.

1894
01:31:59,280 --> 01:32:00,281
Hey.

1895
01:32:00,440 --> 01:32:02,204
There's consequences to your actions

1896
01:32:02,360 --> 01:32:05,125
because you gonna be
in trouble in a second.

1897
01:32:05,280 --> 01:32:06,441
- Oh, yeah?
- Hold up. Yeah.

1898
01:32:06,600 --> 01:32:08,284
I'm gonna take you on a date.

1899
01:32:08,440 --> 01:32:10,249
- Okay.
- Ow. I'm shot in the leg. Ow!

1900
01:32:10,400 --> 01:32:11,970
Ow, ow, ow!

1901
01:32:12,320 --> 01:32:14,243
You ready to go, Keanu?

1902
01:32:16,480 --> 01:32:18,005
You're a cutie.

1903
01:32:18,160 --> 01:32:20,811
I can see why he did all of that for you.

1904
01:32:27,800 --> 01:32:29,962
HULKAI <i>Help!</i>

1905
01:32:30,120 --> 01:32:31,167
<i>(He'll) me!</i>

1906
01:32:31,640 --> 01:32:32,801
Help me!

1907
01:32:33,120 --> 01:32:34,246
Oh, thank God.

1908
01:32:34,440 --> 01:32:36,124
Yo, kill it! Kill it!

1909
01:32:36,320 --> 01:32:38,926
It hurts so bad, you don't even know.

1910
01:32:44,280 --> 01:32:46,328
Hasn't even
been that bad, really.

1911
01:32:46,480 --> 01:32:48,296
Clarence and I, having killed
the Allentown brothers

1912
01:32:48,320 --> 01:32:51,483
has us kind of lookin' like
crime heroes or somethin'.

1913
01:32:51,640 --> 01:32:53,722
We don't even have to
change our voice or anything.

1914
01:32:54,960 --> 01:32:57,122
Mostly it's just good to see you.

1915
01:32:57,600 --> 01:32:58,840
I love you, Keanu.

1916
01:33:02,160 --> 01:33:03,161
How <i>much</i> longer?

1917
01:33:03,320 --> 01:33:05,322
Three more weeks, baby.
That's it. 21 days.

1918
01:33:06,640 --> 01:33:07,920
And what are you gonna do to me?

1919
01:33:07,960 --> 01:33:10,280
I'm gonna take this moustache
and I'm just gonna go like...

1920
01:33:10,360 --> 01:33:11,850
Gonna rub it all over your neck.

1921
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:13,256
- Moustache in here...
- I'm gonna put my 'stache

1922
01:33:13,280 --> 01:33:14,600
right in there. I'm just gonna...

1923
01:33:15,960 --> 01:33:17,405
Hey! Quit poundin' on the glass.

1924
01:33:17,560 --> 01:33:19,369
I'm sorry, sir. I apologize.

1925
01:33:19,520 --> 01:33:21,807
That's my wife, though.
That was a love pound.

1926
01:33:26,400 --> 01:33:28,209
- Hey
- Hey.

1927
01:33:28,560 --> 01:33:29,800
Thanks for watching him.

1928
01:33:29,960 --> 01:33:31,041
No problem.

1929
01:33:31,240 --> 01:33:33,163
He's like one of the family.

1930
01:33:33,720 --> 01:33:36,166
I do have some news for you, though.

1931
01:33:36,320 --> 01:33:37,606
What?

1932
01:33:37,760 --> 01:33:39,808
I took Keanu to the vet.

1933
01:33:41,880 --> 01:33:43,530
He has a rare disease.

1934
01:33:44,160 --> 01:33:45,400
Oh, no.

1935
01:33:46,720 --> 01:33:49,041
He's gonna be a kitten forever.

1936
01:34:12,280 --> 01:34:14,362
What's going on, motherfuckers?

1937
01:34:15,120 --> 01:34:18,124
Okay. Let's do this.
