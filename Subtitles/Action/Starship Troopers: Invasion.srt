01:23:16,958 --> 01:23:20,098
Do you realize that
you not only destroyed my ship

1054
01:23:20,261 --> 01:23:21,968
and killed my crew,

1055
01:23:22,130 --> 01:23:26,738
but you also put the entire planet
at risk for infestation.

1056
01:23:27,135 --> 01:23:29,479
My apologies for your loss.

1057
01:23:29,637 --> 01:23:32,345
But my research is going to save
an entire galaxy.

1058
01:23:34,242 --> 01:23:36,779
Just like I saved you.

1059
01:23:39,748 --> 01:23:41,728
It was you.

1060
01:23:42,017 --> 01:23:44,725
You told me how to find Hero.

1061
01:23:46,121 --> 01:23:48,158
Well, that's classified.

1062
01:23:48,323 --> 01:23:51,770
See, nothing can stop us when
the three of us are working together.

1063
01:23:51,926 --> 01:23:53,599
Are we, Carl?

1064
01:23:53,762 --> 01:23:58,040
Pardon?
Are we? Working together?

1065
01:23:59,334 --> 01:24:01,439
Cheer up, Johnny.
You're a hero.

1066
01:24:01,603 --> 01:24:03,014
No.

1067
01:24:03,171 --> 01:24:05,310
No, I'm not.

1068
01:24:06,641 --> 01:24:08,552
But I met one.
