00:19:56,267 --> 00:19:59,668
A virgin brain.
We're gonna start you off right.

356
00:19:59,737 --> 00:20:02,706
Just save us some time,
tell me what you know.

357
00:20:02,773 --> 00:20:04,172
Just what I've read.

358
00:20:04,241 --> 00:20:07,176
That the technology
was developed for the Feds...

359
00:20:07,244 --> 00:20:11,840
to replace the body wire,
and now it's gone black market.

360
00:20:11,916 --> 00:20:13,850
That's right, so...

361
00:20:13,918 --> 00:20:16,614
this conversation's
not taking place, OK?

362
00:20:16,687 --> 00:20:19,178
-Damn right it's not.
-Good.

363
00:20:19,256 --> 00:20:22,282
Do I get the deck from you?

364
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:25,090
I'll get you a deck at my cost.
My thing is the software.

365
00:20:25,162 --> 00:20:26,220

366
00:20:26,297 --> 00:20:27,924
Clips. Right.

367
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:33,637
Listen, I want you to know
what we're talking about here.

368
00:20:33,704 --> 00:20:36,639
This is not
"like TV, only better."

369
00:20:36,707 --> 00:20:39,801
This is life.

370
00:20:39,877 --> 00:20:42,072
It's a piece of somebody's life.

371
00:20:42,146 --> 00:20:45,980
It's pure and uncut, straight
from the cerebral cortex.

372
00:20:46,050 --> 00:20:48,143
You're there. You're doing it.

373
00:20:48,219 --> 00:20:49,982
You're seeing it, hearing it.

374
00:20:50,054 --> 00:20:51,155
You're feeling it.

375
00:20:51,155 --> 00:20:51,621

376
00:20:52,723 --> 00:20:56,181
What kind of things, exactly?

377
00:20:56,260 --> 00:20:58,694
Anything. Whatever you want,
whoever you wanna be.

378
00:20:58,763 --> 00:21:01,994
Want to go skiing without
leaving your den,you can...

379
00:21:02,066 --> 00:21:04,330
but I'm assuming
that a guy like you...

380
00:21:04,402 --> 00:21:06,666
you want to ski,
you fly to Aspen.

381
00:21:06,737 --> 00:21:08,671
That's not what
you're interested in.

382
00:21:08,739 --> 00:21:09,706
It's...

383
00:21:12,410 --> 00:21:15,174
It's about the stuff
that you can't have, right?

384
00:21:15,246 --> 00:21:17,339
The forbidden fruit, hmm?

385
00:21:17,415 --> 00:21:20,350
Running into a liquor store with
a .357 Magnum in your hand...

386
00:21:20,418 --> 00:21:23,615
feeling the adrenaline
pumping through yourveins, huh?

387
00:21:23,688 --> 00:21:28,625
Or see that guy with the
drop-dead Filipino girlfriend?

388
00:21:28,693 --> 00:21:31,856
Wouldn'tyou like to be
that guy fortwenty minutes?

389
00:21:31,929 --> 00:21:33,362
The right twenty minutes.

390
00:21:33,431 --> 00:21:35,331
I can make it happen...

391
00:21:35,399 --> 00:21:37,560
and you won't even tarnish
your wedding ring.

392
00:21:41,205 --> 00:21:42,365
Sounds good.

393
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:45,307
I can get you what you want.

394
00:21:45,376 --> 00:21:48,004
I can get you anything.
Just talk to me.

395
00:21:48,079 --> 00:21:51,571
You have to trust me, OK?
'Cause I'm your priest.

396
00:21:51,649 --> 00:21:53,207
I'm your shrink.

397
00:21:53,284 --> 00:21:57,380
I am your main connection
to the switch board of souls.

398
00:21:58,889 --> 00:22:00,982
I'm the Magic Man.

399
00:22:01,058 --> 00:22:04,050
The Santa Claus
of the subconscious.

400
00:22:04,128 --> 00:22:07,256
You say it,
you think it,you can have it.

401
00:22:09,233 --> 00:22:11,497
You want a girl?

402
00:22:11,569 --> 00:22:12,763
You want two girls?

403
00:22:14,238 --> 00:22:17,503
I don't know what your thing is,
what you're curious about.

404
00:22:17,575 --> 00:22:18,974
You want a guy?

405
00:22:20,511 --> 00:22:22,672
Maybe you want to be a girl.

406
00:22:22,747 --> 00:22:25,545
Hey,think of that. Be a girl.

407
00:22:25,616 --> 00:22:26,947
See what that feels like.

408
00:22:27,017 --> 00:22:29,781
Maybe you want a nun
to tie you up.

409
00:22:29,854 --> 00:22:31,685
It's all doable.

410
00:22:32,723 --> 00:22:34,281
Talk to me about costs.

411
00:22:34,358 --> 00:22:37,623
Before we get into numbers,
I want you to try a taste.

412
00:22:37,695 --> 00:22:39,595

Your supervisor has recommended
an excellent club...

It's on La Cienega.

701

Thank you.

of this gentleman?

736

Faith, can I talk to you
for one second?

737
00:39:45,155 --> 00:39:47,885
It's not a good idea right now.

738

I just gotta talk to you
for one second.

between you and Faith.

742

You see,
that's your problem, Lenny...

743
00:40:03,373 --> 00:40:04,704
you assume too much.

744
00:40:04,774 --> 00:40:07,106
You assume there's something
where there's nothing.

You assume
that you have a life...

of other people's lives...

754

the historical perspective.

what I'm charging him--

is OK atthe same time.

1050
01:01:55,917 --> 01:01:57,942

Are you gonna protect me?

Are you a big tough guy?
You're a fucking talker.

You don't even own a gun.

1053

FAITH: Lenny just stopped by
to give me some bad news.

1059
01:02:22,410 --> 01:02:24,037
An oldfriend of mine's
been murdered.

1060
01:02:24,112 --> 01:02:25,943
Remember lris?

1061
01:02:26,014 --> 01:02:27,641

did you get up here?

Tell you what, Lenny.

1064
01:02:32,220 --> 01:02:34,984
Just for you, hmm?
Make you a deal.

1065
01:02:35,056 --> 01:02:36,956
Why don't you just take her?

1066
01:02:37,025 --> 01:02:39,459
If she's so unhappy and
wants to leave, she can go.

1067
01:02:39,528 --> 01:02:41,393
I'll let her decide.

1068
01:02:41,463 --> 01:02:44,921
Faith always knows
what she wants. Don't you, baby?

1069
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:47,264
See? Hands off.

1070
01:02:50,038 --> 01:02:51,266
I'll tell you something else.

1071
01:02:52,040 --> 01:02:53,871
I'll tell you this,you fuck.

1072
01:02:53,942 --> 01:02:57,503
If she says she stays,you go.

1073
01:02:57,579 --> 01:03:00,810
You crawl
back in your cockroach hole...

1074

cross my vision again.

1076
01:03:11,426 --> 01:03:12,552

I've made my choice, Lenny.

1079
01:03:36,251 --> 01:03:37,377
Get him out.

You're fucking crazy, Faith!

Come with me! Faith!

1083
01:03:50,565 --> 01:03:53,363
I don't love you anymore!
Do you understand that?

1084

You mean nothing to me!

1085

gonna get lris out of this.

1087

GANT: Now you understand
the danger we're in.

1088
01:04:08,783 --> 01:04:11,115
That was so sweet what you
said out there. So touching.

1089
01:04:11,186 --> 01:04:13,017
I almost believed it.

1090
01:04:13,088 --> 01:04:16,751
I don't think he understands
you did it for him.

1091
01:04:16,825 --> 01:04:18,793
He doesn't even know
what's going on.

1092
01:04:18,860 --> 01:04:19,952
Leave him alone!

1093
01:04:20,028 --> 01:04:21,893
I'd leave him alone
if he'd stop coming around...

1094
01:04:21,963 --> 01:04:24,056
and you would just stop
talking to him!

1095
01:04:28,236 --> 01:04:30,761
The only time a whore
should open her mouth...

1096
01:04:31,573 --> 01:04:33,302
is when she's giving head.

LENNY: Can we be smart here?
I can make itworth yourwhile.

I'm not saying
I mind a couple of shots.

1104

to beatthe shit out of you,
but itwas short notice.

1115

they'll never nail this guy...

the second
they walk in the room.

1126
01:06:32,794 --> 01:06:34,819
It's all about
whatthey see walking in--

1127
01:06:34,896 --> 01:06:37,956
dead hooker, handcuffs,
penetration.

1128

They know nobody gives a shit
about a dead hooker.

1130

They're road kill, right?

1131
01:06:44,005 --> 01:06:46,633
They'll take some pictures,
make some jokes...

1132
01:06:46,708 --> 01:06:49,472
and just shrug it off
like it's a random kill.

she knew somebody was after her.

1562
01:36:04,508 --> 01:36:06,100
LENNY: We know aboutJeriko.

1563
01:36:06,176 --> 01:36:07,803
Iris made me a copy of the tape.

1564
01:36:07,878 --> 01:36:11,006
I was trying to keepyou
out of this.

1565
01:36:11,081 --> 01:36:12,480
LENNY: I know. How'd it happen?

1566
01:36:12,549 --> 01:36:15,416
MACE: Why was lris riding around
with Jeriko wearing a wire?

1567
01:36:15,486 --> 01:36:17,954
Faith, listen--Look at me.

1568
01:36:18,021 --> 01:36:20,353
You gotto trust us.
We're here to helpyou.

1569
01:36:22,526 --> 01:36:23,925
All right.
I'll talkto you alone.

1570
01:36:23,994 --> 01:36:25,757
Mace is in this.

1571
01:36:25,829 --> 01:36:27,023
Tell us.

1572
01:36:28,399 --> 01:36:29,525
Faith.

1573
01:36:33,737 --> 01:36:36,331
Philo, he's gotten
obsessed with playback.

1574
01:36:37,341 --> 01:36:39,172
He's a total wiretripjunkie.

1575
01:36:39,943 --> 01:36:43,276
He's such a controlfreak, he's
been having peoplefollowed.

1576
01:36:43,347 --> 01:36:45,611
He's recording his business
partners' phone calls.

1577
01:36:45,682 --> 01:36:47,809
He's wiring up people
left and right.

1578
01:36:49,486 --> 01:36:51,283
Philo and Jeriko
weren't getting along.

1579
01:36:51,355 --> 01:36:53,414
He was afraid Jeriko
was gonna dump him...

1580
01:36:53,490 --> 01:36:56,789
but he wasn't sure, so he starts
with the surveillance.

1581
01:36:56,860 --> 01:36:59,624
A couple of nights ago,
he wires up lris...

1582
01:36:59,696 --> 01:37:01,630
and he sends her
and the other girl, Diamanda...

1583
01:37:01,698 --> 01:37:03,563
overto Jeriko's table.

1584
01:37:07,271 --> 01:37:09,364
DIAMANDA: Hi, baby.

1585
01:37:09,440 --> 01:37:11,635
IRIS: Hi. My name is lris.

1586
01:37:11,708 --> 01:37:12,902
JERIKO: Hey.

1587
01:37:13,777 --> 01:37:16,041
IRIS: I got a presentforyou.

1588
01:37:17,214 --> 01:37:18,442
You are so beautiful.

1589
01:37:20,184 --> 01:37:22,778
FAITH: So that night,
lris calls up crying.

1590
01:37:22,853 --> 01:37:24,115
She'sfreaking out.

1591
01:37:24,188 --> 01:37:26,748
She comes over,
and she plays the tape.

1592
01:37:26,824 --> 01:37:27,984
Philo loses it.

1593
01:37:28,058 --> 01:37:31,084
He can't believe the disaster
she's gotten him into.

1594
01:37:31,161 --> 01:37:33,391
He's afraid the cops
will beat it out of her...

1595
01:37:33,464 --> 01:37:36,524
who she's been workingfor
and then come lookingfor him.

1596
01:37:40,003 --> 01:37:41,868
MACE: Why didn't he just
go public with the tape?

1597
01:37:41,939 --> 01:37:43,031
Save himself thatway?

1598
01:37:43,106 --> 01:37:45,666
FAITH: lf it got out
he spied on his own artists...

1599
01:37:45,742 --> 01:37:48,267
he'd lose all his other acts,
and it'd be overfor him.

1600
01:38:01,058 --> 01:38:02,355
PHILO: Shh.

1601
01:38:11,668 --> 01:38:13,863
FAITH:
So he gives lris some money.

1602
01:38:13,937 --> 01:38:17,134
He tells herto check into
a hotel under an assumed name...

1603
01:38:17,207 --> 01:38:19,107

whatto do.

1605
01:38:20,878 --> 01:38:22,607
You think he killed her?

1606
01:38:22,679 --> 01:38:24,874
The killer knew where she was
because he put herthere.

1607
01:38:27,284 --> 01:38:28,979
What a nightmare.

1608
01:38:29,052 --> 01:38:31,452

thefuck she is, butwe're late.

to work it atthe Bonaventure?

1611

Ahh

2087
02:16:56,057 --> 02:16:58,116
Ahhh

2088
02:16:59,861 --> 02:17:01,692
Ahhh

2089
02:17:05,934 --> 02:17:10,837
Ahhhh

2090
02:17:20,548 --> 02:17:24,507
Ahhh

2091
02:17:29,791 --> 02:17:32,385
Pretend there's no night

2092
02:17:33,228 --> 02:17:36,288
Hold on

2093
02:17:36,364 --> 02:17:37,854
Everything has

2094
02:17:37,932 --> 02:17:40,127
Come apart

2095
02:17:42,170 --> 02:17:45,003
But in this moment

2096
02:17:45,874 --> 02:17:48,240
Right now

2097
02:17:48,309 --> 02:17:50,641
When it can come together

2098
02:17:54,682 --> 02:17:59,984
Makes no sense

2099
02:18:00,054 --> 02:18:04,650
What's there to lose?

2100
02:18:06,928 --> 02:18:09,897
Fall in the light

2101
02:18:09,964 --> 02:18:12,831
Fall in the light

2102
02:18:12,901 --> 02:18:19,067
Fall in the light

2103
02:18:19,140 --> 02:18:21,836
Will you catch me
if I'mfalling?

2104
02:18:21,910 --> 02:18:23,468
Will you catch me?

2105
02:18:24,612 --> 02:18:27,342
Hold on...hold on

2106
02:18:29,017 --> 02:18:29,751
Hold on

2107
02:18:29,751 --> 02:18:30,513
Hold on

2108
02:18:30,585 --> 02:18:31,711
Will you catch me?
