1
00:00:17,251 --> 00:00:19,446
[Aramis]
Some of this is legend,

2
00:00:19,531 --> 00:00:22,125
but at least
this much is fact -

3
00:00:22,211 --> 00:00:26,602
when rioting citizens of France
destroyed the Bastille,

4
00:00:26,691 --> 00:00:30,809
they discovered in its records
this mysterious entry...

5
00:01:09,571 --> 00:01:11,482
You dead yet?

6
00:02:17,244 --> 00:02:18,996
[Man] Aramis!

7
00:02:21,284 --> 00:02:23,161
Aramis!

8
00:02:23,244 --> 00:02:25,917
Porthos is...

9
00:02:26,004 --> 00:02:30,600
[Porthos] I'm sorry, my dears.
You would have enjoyed it.

10
00:02:30,684 --> 00:02:33,278
He's hung like a donkey.

11
00:02:33,364 --> 00:02:35,082
- So are you!
- Really?

12
00:02:35,164 --> 00:02:39,601
He's been asleep so long,
I'd forgotten.

13
00:02:39,684 --> 00:02:41,914
OK, go on now.

14
00:02:42,004 --> 00:02:43,915
Leave His Holiness alone.

15
00:02:44,004 --> 00:02:47,155
I'll bring you back tomorrow,
when he's in a better mood.

16
00:02:47,244 --> 00:02:50,600
Go on, ladies. Go!

17
00:02:55,164 --> 00:02:58,440
Stop praying
and revel with me, Aramis!

18
00:02:58,524 --> 00:03:00,401
I need my spirits lifted.

19
00:03:00,484 --> 00:03:03,157
I'm old, I'm weak,
my strength is gone.

20
00:03:03,244 --> 00:03:04,677
Porthos!

21
00:03:04,764 --> 00:03:08,154
- I'm praying.
- I just said that.

22
00:03:08,244 --> 00:03:11,634
Are you deaf, too?
I know you're blind,

23
00:03:11,724 --> 00:03:15,080
because if you'd seen those tits
you'd have tears in your eyes.

24
00:03:15,164 --> 00:03:17,598
There's more to life

25
00:03:17,684 --> 00:03:19,197
than a good pair of tits.

26
00:03:19,284 --> 00:03:20,683
Really?

27
00:03:22,364 --> 00:03:25,561
If you can name me one thing,

28
00:03:25,644 --> 00:03:27,282
one single thing,

29
00:03:27,364 --> 00:03:29,832
that is more sublime

30
00:03:29,924 --> 00:03:32,836
than the feel of a plump pink
nipple between my lips,

31
00:03:32,924 --> 00:03:35,802
I'll build you a new cathedral.

32
00:03:37,444 --> 00:03:39,116
Forgiveness.

33
00:03:39,204 --> 00:03:41,195
Forgiveness?

34
00:03:43,524 --> 00:03:44,923
[Porthos farts]

35
00:03:46,764 --> 00:03:48,675
Forgive me...

36
00:03:49,284 --> 00:03:51,240
Forgive me...

37
00:03:51,324 --> 00:03:54,077
Am I forgiven?

38
00:03:55,204 --> 00:03:57,764
Hm? Am I forgiven?

39
00:04:01,444 --> 00:04:04,754
Your forgiveness isn't sweeter
than a plump nipple.

40
00:04:04,844 --> 00:04:06,721
Don't you understand?

41
00:04:06,804 --> 00:04:09,113
I'm trying to pray!

42
00:04:09,204 --> 00:04:11,195
You're always praying!

43
00:04:15,884 --> 00:04:17,920
[Aramis] D'Artagnan!

44
00:04:18,004 --> 00:04:21,679
Oh! D'Artagnan!

45
00:04:21,764 --> 00:04:23,436
How are you, young pup?

46
00:04:23,524 --> 00:04:25,435
You interrupted
a theological discussion.

47
00:04:25,524 --> 00:04:27,719
- So I see.
- Welcome. Sit down.

48
00:04:27,804 --> 00:04:30,876
No, I come upon
the King's business.

49
00:04:30,964 --> 00:04:33,319
He wishes to see you.

50
00:04:33,404 --> 00:04:35,076
You serve him loyally,

51
00:04:35,164 --> 00:04:39,362
even though people throw
rotten eggs at his emblem.

52
00:04:39,444 --> 00:04:41,036
D'Artagnan, look at you!

53
00:04:41,124 --> 00:04:45,037
You look so young
and I feel so old.

54
00:04:48,964 --> 00:04:50,920
The King says immediately.

55
00:04:54,404 --> 00:04:56,235
One for all, d'Artagnan.

56
00:04:58,484 --> 00:05:00,361
And all for one.

57
00:05:04,124 --> 00:05:07,082
We were all Musketeers once.

58
00:05:10,844 --> 00:05:13,153
I wonder how Athos is doing.

59
00:05:14,284 --> 00:05:16,240
Relax, Raoul.

60
00:05:16,324 --> 00:05:18,235
After all, you're my son.

61
00:05:18,324 --> 00:05:20,918
How could any woman resist you?

62
00:05:21,004 --> 00:05:22,676
When will you ask her?

63
00:05:22,764 --> 00:05:25,403
Today, as we arrive...

64
00:05:25,484 --> 00:05:27,759
or when we leave.

65
00:05:27,844 --> 00:05:29,914
When I think about it,
I get confused.

66
00:05:30,004 --> 00:05:32,154
Will this help?

67
00:05:35,404 --> 00:05:36,803
Mother's ring.

68
00:05:36,884 --> 00:05:38,795
I can't take this. It's yours.

69
00:05:38,884 --> 00:05:41,557
She died giving you to me.

70
00:05:41,644 --> 00:05:46,274
I want to die knowing it's worn
by the woman my son loves.

71
00:05:46,364 --> 00:05:48,514
Go! Bring back your fiancée.

72
00:06:18,426 --> 00:06:21,384
Your Majesty, the attack
will come at dawn.

73
00:06:21,466 --> 00:06:24,697
No, no. Do not
underestimate the Dutch.

74
00:06:27,866 --> 00:06:29,777
These troops will be
cut off here,

75
00:06:29,866 --> 00:06:32,300
so shift them here and here.

76
00:06:32,386 --> 00:06:34,297
Then we outnumber them there.

77
00:06:34,386 --> 00:06:35,865
Send that.

78
00:06:35,946 --> 00:06:37,061
Your Majesty!

79
00:06:37,146 --> 00:06:38,420
The yellow sash.

80
00:06:38,506 --> 00:06:41,179
As your advisors,
we feel that it's...

81
00:06:41,266 --> 00:06:44,736
- ..our duty...
- Yes, our duty to inform you

82
00:06:44,826 --> 00:06:47,215
that there are riots in Paris.

83
00:06:47,306 --> 00:06:49,183
Riots?

84
00:06:49,266 --> 00:06:52,178
Paris is the most beautiful
city in the world.

85
00:06:52,266 --> 00:06:55,144
Why should my people
feel anything

86
00:06:55,226 --> 00:06:56,659
but pride and contentment?

87
00:06:56,746 --> 00:06:58,145
Of course, Your Majesty.

88
00:06:58,226 --> 00:07:00,376
I'm sure they are
content and proud.

89
00:07:00,466 --> 00:07:02,502
But they are also starving.

90
00:07:02,586 --> 00:07:07,262
If we distributed some of the
food reserved for the army...

91
00:07:07,346 --> 00:07:10,383
[Man] The priest Aramis!

92
00:07:21,466 --> 00:07:24,378
Father Aramis, His Majesty
is experiencing difficulty

93
00:07:24,466 --> 00:07:27,902
- with the Jesuits.
- The Jesuits?

94
00:07:27,986 --> 00:07:31,376
They have declared
His Majesty's wars unjust.

95
00:07:31,466 --> 00:07:34,378
His Majesty should speak
to their leader.

96
00:07:34,466 --> 00:07:35,899
But who is he?

97
00:07:35,986 --> 00:07:38,625
No one can keep secrets
like the Jesuits.

98
00:07:38,706 --> 00:07:40,264
Ah, Aramis!

99
00:07:40,346 --> 00:07:42,541
Your Majesty.

100
00:07:48,146 --> 00:07:52,856
You are a priest,
but once you were a Musketeer.

101
00:07:52,946 --> 00:07:54,618
Like my father,

102
00:07:54,706 --> 00:07:57,618
I have trusted you
with the gravest of missions.

103
00:07:58,746 --> 00:07:59,701
So...

104
00:08:02,226 --> 00:08:05,662
I want you to find the
secret leader of the Jesuits.

105
00:08:05,746 --> 00:08:07,737
And when you have,

106
00:08:07,826 --> 00:08:09,737
for God and for France,

107
00:08:09,826 --> 00:08:11,384
I wish you to kill him.

108
00:08:15,026 --> 00:08:17,460
I know this is
a terrible thing I ask,

109
00:08:17,546 --> 00:08:20,936
especially from a priest.

110
00:08:21,026 --> 00:08:23,381
Can you accept this mission

111
00:08:23,466 --> 00:08:25,855
and keep it private?

112
00:08:28,786 --> 00:08:33,177
When I discover the identity
of this Jesuit rebel,

113
00:08:34,386 --> 00:08:38,698
I will kill both him
and the man who told me.

114
00:08:38,786 --> 00:08:42,540
Once a Musketeer,
always a Musketeer, hmm?

115
00:08:45,826 --> 00:08:47,737
[The King] About these riots...

116
00:08:47,826 --> 00:08:50,340
We have stocks
on the wharves now.

117
00:08:50,426 --> 00:08:51,859
Distribute that.

118
00:08:51,946 --> 00:08:54,062
But that food is spoiling.

119
00:08:54,146 --> 00:08:56,706
That's why it wasn't
sent to the army.

120
00:08:56,786 --> 00:08:58,663
Then you must hurry.

121
00:08:58,746 --> 00:09:01,977
What an excellent idea,
Your Majesty.

122
00:09:02,066 --> 00:09:04,375
Look at that stitching!

123
00:09:04,466 --> 00:09:06,138
Don't they look glorious?

124
00:09:06,226 --> 00:09:08,296
Not so glorious as you.

125
00:09:13,464 --> 00:09:14,897
Who is that?

126
00:09:17,624 --> 00:09:19,580
Raoul, the son of Athos.

127
00:09:19,664 --> 00:09:22,576
François, you may like
young soldiers,

128
00:09:22,664 --> 00:09:25,622
but I'm referring
to the beauty with him.

129
00:09:25,704 --> 00:09:28,935
Her name is Christine.

130
00:09:36,224 --> 00:09:39,136
[Fanfare]

131
00:10:10,944 --> 00:10:12,263
Your Majesty?

132
00:10:15,104 --> 00:10:16,856
What now, d'Artagnan?

133
00:10:16,944 --> 00:10:19,060
Assassins falling from the sky?

134
00:10:19,144 --> 00:10:21,863
I was not told
of the pig chase.

135
00:10:21,944 --> 00:10:24,139
Look at these men's faces.

136
00:10:24,224 --> 00:10:26,613
Howthey admire you.

137
00:10:26,704 --> 00:10:28,183
With you protecting me,

138
00:10:28,264 --> 00:10:31,017
what fool would try to harm me?

139
00:10:31,104 --> 00:10:33,698
A fool's blade can be
sharper than his brain.

140
00:10:33,784 --> 00:10:35,695
Let us play a game.

141
00:10:35,784 --> 00:10:38,298
Let's pretend that I am king

142
00:10:38,384 --> 00:10:40,340
and you are captain
of my Musketeers.

143
00:10:40,424 --> 00:10:42,255
Pretend my wish is law,

144
00:10:42,344 --> 00:10:45,461
and my wish is
to enjoy this party.

145
00:10:45,544 --> 00:10:47,899
As should you.

146
00:10:49,984 --> 00:10:51,576
[King Louis] Ladies!

147
00:11:00,624 --> 00:11:03,058
Christine...
ever since I arrived...

148
00:11:03,144 --> 00:11:05,135
- Monsieur? Mademoiselle?
- No, thank you.

149
00:11:05,984 --> 00:11:07,895
- Christine...
- Raoul!

150
00:11:07,984 --> 00:11:09,781
D'Artagnan!

151
00:11:09,864 --> 00:11:12,424
Captain, may I present
Christine Bellefort.

152
00:11:13,624 --> 00:11:15,023
Enchanté.

153
00:11:15,104 --> 00:11:17,698
D'Artagnan
is my father's best friend.

154
00:11:17,784 --> 00:11:19,581
I am honoured

155
00:11:19,664 --> 00:11:22,542
you granted my request
to join the Musketeers.

156
00:11:22,624 --> 00:11:24,262
The honour is mine.

157
00:11:24,344 --> 00:11:26,141
One for all...

158
00:11:26,224 --> 00:11:28,215
And all for one.

159
00:11:28,304 --> 00:11:30,022
Christine...

160
00:11:34,064 --> 00:11:35,941
I love you.

161
00:11:36,024 --> 00:11:38,822
And I love you, Raoul.

162
00:11:38,904 --> 00:11:42,214
I'll never be rich,
but you have my heart.

163
00:11:42,304 --> 00:11:44,454
Then I am richer than the King.

164
00:11:47,784 --> 00:11:49,456
I have something to give you...

165
00:11:49,744 --> 00:11:51,735
[Shrill squealing]

166
00:11:54,224 --> 00:11:57,534
[Louis] We offer a contest
of cunning and agility.

167
00:11:57,624 --> 00:11:59,740
Behold our unicorn!

168
00:12:02,024 --> 00:12:04,413
Whoever captures our unicorn,

169
00:12:04,504 --> 00:12:06,540
shall win its treasure.

170
00:12:09,624 --> 00:12:13,936
Now, to the chase!
I command you all!

171
00:12:17,064 --> 00:12:19,532
The pendant will be yours!

172
00:13:22,344 --> 00:13:25,734
Christine, isn't it?
I'd have thought it impossible,

173
00:13:25,824 --> 00:13:29,897
but the excitement of the chase
has made you more beautiful.

174
00:13:29,984 --> 00:13:32,498
Sire, l...thank you.

175
00:13:32,584 --> 00:13:34,256
You blush.

176
00:13:34,344 --> 00:13:36,380
You do not wish to look
beautiful for your king?

177
00:13:36,464 --> 00:13:40,742
No, sire! I mean...yes...
Of course, sire!

178
00:13:40,824 --> 00:13:43,179
- I mean, you are...
- It's all right.

179
00:13:43,264 --> 00:13:45,824
You're not used
to these surroundings.

180
00:13:45,904 --> 00:13:49,817
That is a condition
we can happily remedy.

181
00:13:54,384 --> 00:13:57,456
You would fit nicely
as a lady-in-waiting.

182
00:13:57,544 --> 00:14:02,572
His Majesty is...
very...very kind.

183
00:14:03,664 --> 00:14:07,782
But I am engaged to Raoul -
or will be when he asks me.

184
00:14:07,864 --> 00:14:09,741
You would choose a soldier

185
00:14:09,824 --> 00:14:12,133
who has not yet proposed

186
00:14:12,224 --> 00:14:13,657
above a king?

187
00:14:13,744 --> 00:14:16,736
I can only be faithful
to my heart.

188
00:14:16,824 --> 00:14:19,896
But how faithful
is that heart to you?

189
00:14:20,704 --> 00:14:22,296
[Pig grunts]

190
00:14:34,784 --> 00:14:36,422
Wait, Christine!

191
00:14:56,344 --> 00:14:58,733
- Christine!
- Raoul!

192
00:15:00,984 --> 00:15:02,815
Feed your people!

193
00:15:09,024 --> 00:15:10,696
Jesuits!

194
00:15:25,864 --> 00:15:28,173
Get me a general!

195
00:15:52,504 --> 00:15:55,974
[Metal clanging on metal]

196
00:17:00,737 --> 00:17:03,729
Her Majesty
wishes a word with you.

197
00:17:13,137 --> 00:17:14,855
Your Majesty?

198
00:17:14,937 --> 00:17:18,213
I understand you saved
my son's life today.

199
00:17:18,297 --> 00:17:21,812
God smiled upon us,
Your Majesty.

200
00:17:21,897 --> 00:17:24,047
And you are not hurt?

201
00:17:24,137 --> 00:17:27,573
- No, my lady.
- That is good.

202
00:17:38,937 --> 00:17:40,893
Captain?

203
00:17:40,977 --> 00:17:42,888
Raoul, son of Athos,

204
00:17:42,977 --> 00:17:46,413
has withdrawn his request
to join the Musketeers.

205
00:17:49,743 --> 00:17:50,103
[Plays a plaintive melody]

206
00:17:50,103 --> 00:17:52,492
[Plays a plaintive melody]

207
00:17:59,223 --> 00:18:00,702
D'Artagnan!

208
00:18:00,783 --> 00:18:02,899
You have improved.

209
00:18:02,983 --> 00:18:04,621
It's been so long!

210
00:18:04,703 --> 00:18:06,421
So it has, my friend.

211
00:18:07,503 --> 00:18:09,141
What's the occasion?

212
00:18:09,223 --> 00:18:11,612
As you say, it's been too long.

213
00:18:11,703 --> 00:18:15,173
The great d'Artagnan
must have the best wine.

214
00:18:15,263 --> 00:18:17,731
If the great Athos offers,

215
00:18:17,823 --> 00:18:20,291
then the great d'Artagnan
must drink.

216
00:18:20,383 --> 00:18:24,661
I'm sorry I haven't been
to see you lately, my friend.

217
00:18:24,743 --> 00:18:28,133
Head of the King's bodyguards?
Must keep you busy.

218
00:18:28,223 --> 00:18:30,100
Especially with this king.

219
00:18:30,183 --> 00:18:32,617
Still, I should
have come more often.

220
00:18:32,703 --> 00:18:35,092
Oh, I belong to the past,

221
00:18:35,183 --> 00:18:37,572
when grown men wore the uniform.

222
00:18:37,663 --> 00:18:39,858
At least it gives you time

223
00:18:39,943 --> 00:18:43,379
- to practise your violin.
- And feel sorry for myself.

224
00:18:43,463 --> 00:18:46,261
My son is grown.
He proposed to a wonderful girl.

225
00:18:46,343 --> 00:18:50,177
The errors of my life
are made right in him.

226
00:18:50,263 --> 00:18:53,300
Now, for the life
I've always wished him,

227
00:18:53,383 --> 00:18:56,659
- he's leaving home.
- Athos, l...

228
00:18:56,783 --> 00:18:58,421
Ah!

229
00:18:58,543 --> 00:19:00,454
Out celebrating all night!

230
00:19:00,543 --> 00:19:03,341
Raoul, look who's come to visit.

231
00:19:05,423 --> 00:19:07,300
What's wrong?

232
00:19:07,383 --> 00:19:10,375
I cannot make her a widow,

233
00:19:10,463 --> 00:19:13,375
just as I've made her a wife.

234
00:19:13,463 --> 00:19:16,341
I've been recalled
to my regiment.

235
00:19:16,423 --> 00:19:18,937
But that makes no sense!

236
00:19:19,023 --> 00:19:21,935
You've already served
at the front.

237
00:19:22,023 --> 00:19:23,979
Has there been some disaster?

238
00:19:27,183 --> 00:19:29,981
Has everyone else
been recalled?

239
00:19:30,063 --> 00:19:33,817
I believe the King's eye
has fallen on Christine.

240
00:19:33,903 --> 00:19:37,657
True, he noticed her,
but it has nothing to do...

241
00:19:37,743 --> 00:19:40,621
The King is a dog!

242
00:19:40,703 --> 00:19:42,295
- Athos!
- And a coward!

243
00:19:42,383 --> 00:19:45,181
But I am neither. And so I go.

244
00:19:45,263 --> 00:19:46,537
Raoul!

245
00:19:47,783 --> 00:19:49,774
D'Artagnan!

246
00:19:49,863 --> 00:19:52,775
Does the King have trouble
finding women?

247
00:19:52,863 --> 00:19:54,501
I served his father.

248
00:19:54,583 --> 00:19:58,496
Until I retired, I served him.

249
00:19:58,583 --> 00:20:00,460
And now, to seduce a woman

250
00:20:00,543 --> 00:20:03,535
who'll mean nothing to him
once he's had her,

251
00:20:03,623 --> 00:20:06,057
he would put
my son's life in danger?

252
00:20:06,143 --> 00:20:08,577
You knew this was happening!

253
00:20:08,663 --> 00:20:10,858
That's why you came!

254
00:20:10,943 --> 00:20:13,457
- I knew your temper...
- You came to restrain me?

255
00:20:13,543 --> 00:20:16,694
I came to bring you hope!

256
00:20:18,223 --> 00:20:21,135
I will speak
to the King personally.

257
00:20:21,223 --> 00:20:22,895
I still have faith

258
00:20:22,983 --> 00:20:27,022
he may become the king
we wish him to be.

259
00:20:27,103 --> 00:20:31,813
You don't know what
it's like to have a son.

260
00:20:31,903 --> 00:20:34,861
To have kissed his hair,
watched him grow.

261
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:41,860
Yes, fatherhood is a blessing
I can only imagine.

262
00:20:44,303 --> 00:20:45,702
D'Artagnan!

263
00:20:45,783 --> 00:20:49,059
I have never known
a finer man than you,

264
00:20:49,143 --> 00:20:52,533
but if the King harms my son
merely to take a lover,

265
00:20:52,623 --> 00:20:54,932
then this king becomes my enemy!

266
00:20:55,023 --> 00:20:58,732
As will any man who stands
between him and me!

267
00:20:58,823 --> 00:21:00,893
Then I must hurry,

268
00:21:00,983 --> 00:21:02,894
for I treasure your son...

269
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:06,219
as I treasure you.

270
00:21:15,136 --> 00:21:16,489
Guard the gate!

271
00:21:16,576 --> 00:21:18,055
Captain! The people say

272
00:21:18,136 --> 00:21:21,446
the food the King ordered us
to distribute is rotten.

273
00:21:21,536 --> 00:21:23,970
They're attacking Musketeers.

274
00:21:26,016 --> 00:21:27,415
Get the gates!

275
00:21:43,456 --> 00:21:46,414
- Prepare to fire.
- No! Close the gates!

276
00:21:46,496 --> 00:21:48,293
Do not fire!

277
00:22:00,496 --> 00:22:02,407
It's d'Artagnan!

278
00:22:02,496 --> 00:22:05,886
[Crowd falls silent]

279
00:22:06,016 --> 00:22:09,929
Citizens of Paris, listen to me.

280
00:22:10,016 --> 00:22:13,008
- I am one of you.
- We're starving!

281
00:22:13,096 --> 00:22:15,246
They gave us garbage
not fit for rats!

282
00:22:18,056 --> 00:22:19,205
Listen to me!

283
00:22:22,216 --> 00:22:23,695
Listen, I beg you.

284
00:22:23,776 --> 00:22:24,845
No-o-o-o!

285
00:22:49,816 --> 00:22:52,330
You're right, it is rotten.

286
00:22:52,416 --> 00:22:54,532
I'll speak to the King myself.

287
00:22:54,616 --> 00:22:56,254
You have my word.

288
00:23:00,896 --> 00:23:03,330
And you will release those men,

289
00:23:03,416 --> 00:23:05,884
for they serve France...and you.

290
00:23:35,656 --> 00:23:38,045
[Moans of passion]

291
00:23:44,016 --> 00:23:46,894
Oh, Louis, you were right!

292
00:23:46,976 --> 00:23:50,446
A woman has never known love

293
00:23:50,536 --> 00:23:53,494
until she has known
the love of a king.

294
00:23:53,576 --> 00:23:56,136
I'm hungry.

295
00:24:01,696 --> 00:24:04,130
I'll have some food brought.

296
00:24:04,216 --> 00:24:06,935
I like to eat alone.

297
00:24:09,176 --> 00:24:12,009
By the way,
you're leaving tomorrow.

298
00:24:30,856 --> 00:24:33,734
These passageways
are meant for my security,

299
00:24:33,816 --> 00:24:36,728
not for you
to startle me to death.

300
00:24:36,816 --> 00:24:39,489
It's for your security
that I've come.

301
00:24:39,576 --> 00:24:41,328
I know about the rioting.

302
00:24:41,416 --> 00:24:43,805
Your people want to love you,

303
00:24:43,896 --> 00:24:46,364
but they are eating rotten food.

304
00:24:46,456 --> 00:24:48,811
Rotten food?

305
00:24:50,936 --> 00:24:53,734
I'll deal with that decisively.

306
00:24:53,816 --> 00:24:57,729
There is another matter

307
00:24:57,816 --> 00:25:00,808
of a more personal nature,
Your Majesty...

308
00:25:00,896 --> 00:25:03,774
You are surrounded
by beautiful women.

309
00:25:03,856 --> 00:25:05,733
Do you love any of them?

310
00:25:05,816 --> 00:25:07,727
Quite frequently, actually.

311
00:25:07,816 --> 00:25:10,011
M-hm. And they love you?

312
00:25:10,096 --> 00:25:13,645
How do you know, when a woman
is intimate with you,

313
00:25:13,736 --> 00:25:16,853
that it is you
and not the crown she loves?

314
00:25:16,936 --> 00:25:19,006
You think my affairs are empty?

315
00:25:19,096 --> 00:25:20,848
I think it is possible

316
00:25:20,936 --> 00:25:24,212
for one man to love
one woman all his life

317
00:25:24,296 --> 00:25:26,412
and be the better for it.

318
00:25:26,496 --> 00:25:28,566
You may be right.

319
00:25:28,656 --> 00:25:33,093
Perhaps I haven't met a woman
with a heart like my own

320
00:25:33,176 --> 00:25:34,814
until recently.

321
00:25:37,296 --> 00:25:39,332
Would that be Christine?

322
00:25:39,416 --> 00:25:43,409
D'Artagnan, I fear
you watch me too closely.

323
00:25:43,496 --> 00:25:46,886
Did you send Raoul to war
so that you could pursue her?

324
00:25:46,976 --> 00:25:48,728
Do you question my honour?

325
00:25:48,816 --> 00:25:52,206
No, I do not
question your honour.

326
00:25:52,296 --> 00:25:54,446
It is you I care about.

327
00:25:54,536 --> 00:25:57,334
Raoul will return soon.

328
00:25:57,416 --> 00:26:00,214
You have my word.

329
00:26:00,296 --> 00:26:02,685
Thank you, Your Majesty.

330
00:26:05,136 --> 00:26:06,967
D'Artagnan!

331
00:26:12,536 --> 00:26:14,413
I am a young king...

332
00:26:15,536 --> 00:26:17,606
but I am King.

333
00:26:17,696 --> 00:26:20,927
Then be a good king,
Your Majesty.

334
00:26:30,016 --> 00:26:32,530
You are the new chief advisor.

335
00:26:32,616 --> 00:26:35,050
Execute him for
distributing rotten food.

336
00:26:37,256 --> 00:26:41,169
And the next time
there are rioters, shoot them.

337
00:26:54,982 --> 00:26:58,179
Please take this
to the royal despatchers.

338
00:27:06,222 --> 00:27:10,295
Christi-i-i-ine...

339
00:27:26,302 --> 00:27:29,294
I'll get you water
in a moment, Mother.

340
00:27:38,942 --> 00:27:41,854
'His Majesty regrets
to inform you

341
00:27:41,942 --> 00:27:44,058
'that Raoul, son of Athos,

342
00:27:44,142 --> 00:27:46,576
'has been killed in action.'

343
00:28:40,382 --> 00:28:42,850
Sir, a casualty report came.

344
00:28:45,982 --> 00:28:47,893
Does Athos know of this?

345
00:28:57,222 --> 00:28:59,213
Athos, my friend...

346
00:28:59,302 --> 00:29:01,657
Stop, you traitor!

347
00:29:10,262 --> 00:29:13,698
Athos, listen to me!

348
00:29:13,782 --> 00:29:15,693
The cannons killed Raoul!

349
00:29:15,782 --> 00:29:19,218
Do not add your own death
to this tragedy.

350
00:29:19,302 --> 00:29:20,781
I beg you!

351
00:29:28,622 --> 00:29:31,500
Get back! Get back!

352
00:29:49,582 --> 00:29:51,573
YOU'RE the traitor.

353
00:29:59,222 --> 00:30:01,178
See to the wounded.

354
00:30:17,004 --> 00:30:18,995
Does your new
apartment suit you?

355
00:30:21,924 --> 00:30:25,360
Sire, when you sent for me
after the news of Raoul,

356
00:30:25,444 --> 00:30:27,912
I came to ask for your help.

357
00:30:28,004 --> 00:30:29,915
I have no way to feed my family.

358
00:30:30,004 --> 00:30:31,915
My father is dead, my mother...

359
00:30:32,004 --> 00:30:33,995
..has a sickness of the lungs.

360
00:30:34,084 --> 00:30:37,440
And your sister has
signs of the condition.

361
00:30:37,524 --> 00:30:40,402
My physician saw them both
and is optimistic.

362
00:30:40,484 --> 00:30:43,396
They will recover
at my country estate.

363
00:30:43,484 --> 00:30:45,156
Your Majesty...

364
00:30:45,244 --> 00:30:47,838
I know that for you, this day...

365
00:30:47,924 --> 00:30:50,279
the earth has
spun round many times.

366
00:30:50,364 --> 00:30:52,958
You must still feel it spinning.

367
00:30:53,044 --> 00:30:57,674
Let us sit at a quiet dinner
and bring it to a pause.

368
00:31:05,484 --> 00:31:07,156
Listen to me!

369
00:31:11,884 --> 00:31:14,159
You've lost someone
dear to your heart.

370
00:31:14,244 --> 00:31:19,557
And I have no desire for you
to turn that heart to stone.

371
00:31:21,404 --> 00:31:23,395
I only ask you this:

372
00:31:23,484 --> 00:31:25,918
that whatever you feel tonight,

373
00:31:26,004 --> 00:31:29,963
you allow yourself
to share it openly with me.

374
00:31:47,724 --> 00:31:49,635
To good health.

375
00:32:19,644 --> 00:32:21,600
You are so beautiful.

376
00:32:32,244 --> 00:32:33,996
I cannot do this.

377
00:32:59,284 --> 00:33:01,195
Christine...

378
00:33:01,324 --> 00:33:06,796
I hope you know there is
more of me to love than a crown.

379
00:33:31,124 --> 00:33:33,592
Of all the wonders I have seen,

380
00:33:36,204 --> 00:33:40,197
I have never seen any
as beautiful as you.

381
00:33:53,386 --> 00:33:56,298
[Porthos] Aramis!
ls this the way to hell?

382
00:33:56,386 --> 00:34:01,016
Hell may be our destination,
but not this trip.

383
00:34:14,146 --> 00:34:16,102
[Porthos] A tomb!

384
00:34:16,186 --> 00:34:18,495
We're in a tomb?

385
00:34:31,346 --> 00:34:36,215
The secrecy is regrettable,
but necessary.

386
00:34:36,306 --> 00:34:38,217
[Aramis] Please, sit.

387
00:34:46,186 --> 00:34:51,340
When we were young and saw
injustice, we fought it.

388
00:34:51,426 --> 00:34:54,099
Some problems cannot
be solved with a sword.

389
00:34:54,186 --> 00:34:56,495
Some can't be settled
without one!

390
00:34:56,586 --> 00:34:58,656
Here is the problem at hand.

391
00:34:58,746 --> 00:35:01,897
The Jesuits oppose Louis' wars

392
00:35:01,986 --> 00:35:04,864
and the starvation that results.

393
00:35:04,946 --> 00:35:08,256
So, Louis has ordered me

394
00:35:08,346 --> 00:35:11,941
to discover the identity
of the Jesuits' general.

395
00:35:12,026 --> 00:35:13,937
And to kill him.

396
00:35:17,546 --> 00:35:19,935
Let the secret general
worry about that!

397
00:35:20,026 --> 00:35:21,982
The problem is...

398
00:35:24,066 --> 00:35:25,545
..that I am he.

399
00:35:27,986 --> 00:35:31,820
I am the General
of the Order of Jesuits.

400
00:35:37,666 --> 00:35:40,624
What do you propose to do?

401
00:35:40,706 --> 00:35:42,458
Replace the King.

402
00:35:42,546 --> 00:35:45,219
- I cannot listen to this.
- It can't be done.

403
00:35:46,586 --> 00:35:47,701
It can!

404
00:35:47,786 --> 00:35:49,822
I am with you.

405
00:35:51,786 --> 00:35:53,060
So am l.

406
00:35:53,186 --> 00:35:54,141
No!

407
00:35:54,346 --> 00:35:55,904
I need you.

408
00:35:55,986 --> 00:35:58,022
All for one and one for all.

409
00:35:58,106 --> 00:36:01,735
I cannot betray my king!
I swore an oath!

410
00:36:01,826 --> 00:36:05,580
When a king is dishonourable,
you are removed from your oath.

411
00:36:05,666 --> 00:36:09,215
An oath is an oath
because it cannot be removed!

412
00:36:09,306 --> 00:36:10,864
Why do you follow him?

413
00:36:10,946 --> 00:36:12,299
Why?

414
00:36:12,386 --> 00:36:17,062
What we fought for is greater
than king or rank or reward.

415
00:36:17,146 --> 00:36:18,704
What do you fight for?

416
00:36:18,786 --> 00:36:23,302
For the belief that every man
can be better, even Louis.

417
00:36:25,106 --> 00:36:27,495
Whatever the plan,
I am with you.

418
00:36:30,066 --> 00:36:33,342
The next time we meet,
one of us will die.

419
00:36:36,946 --> 00:36:38,061
Athos, wait!

420
00:36:38,146 --> 00:36:39,420
D'Artagnan!

421
00:36:39,546 --> 00:36:42,504
Even were I not a priest,

422
00:36:42,586 --> 00:36:46,499
I could see that your heart
carries a secret weight

423
00:36:46,586 --> 00:36:49,737
and that it is hurting you
to bear it alone.

424
00:36:50,986 --> 00:36:55,423
I cannot betray my king.

425
00:36:57,866 --> 00:37:00,016
I will defend him with my life.

426
00:37:00,106 --> 00:37:02,859
Then God be with you.

427
00:37:02,946 --> 00:37:05,858
For none of us will.

428
00:38:00,832 --> 00:38:05,747
I hear there was an incident
at the Musketeers' gate,

429
00:38:05,832 --> 00:38:09,745
where a man came
intent on killing me.

430
00:38:09,832 --> 00:38:11,982
Is it our policy now

431
00:38:12,072 --> 00:38:14,632
to let would-be assassins
go free, d'Artagnan?

432
00:38:14,712 --> 00:38:17,670
He wished to kill his own pain.

433
00:38:17,752 --> 00:38:20,585
His son is dead.

434
00:38:20,672 --> 00:38:23,391
I can think of nothing worse.

435
00:38:23,472 --> 00:38:28,387
- What about losing your king?
- That depends on the king.

436
00:38:30,552 --> 00:38:32,463
When I became a Musketeer,

437
00:38:32,552 --> 00:38:35,066
I was told,
each time I drew my sword,

438
00:38:35,152 --> 00:38:38,110
I should consider
not what I killed,

439
00:38:38,192 --> 00:38:40,626
but what I allowed to live.

440
00:38:40,712 --> 00:38:42,987
You know who told me that?

441
00:38:43,072 --> 00:38:45,142
Athos.

442
00:38:45,272 --> 00:38:48,469
If he has become our enemy,

443
00:38:48,552 --> 00:38:51,271
we should ask ourselves why.

444
00:38:51,352 --> 00:38:53,308
Athos is gone.

445
00:38:53,392 --> 00:38:56,543
Porthos and Aramis
are missing, too.

446
00:38:56,632 --> 00:38:59,544
You know them
better than anyone.

447
00:38:59,632 --> 00:39:02,544
Are they a threat to me?

448
00:39:02,632 --> 00:39:07,262
If they are a threat,
we need not seek them out.

449
00:39:07,352 --> 00:39:09,468
They will find us.

450
00:39:15,672 --> 00:39:18,140
Not if you find them first.

451
00:40:40,454 --> 00:40:41,887
Who is that?

452
00:40:41,974 --> 00:40:43,202
Chi è?

453
00:40:43,294 --> 00:40:46,809
È malato.

454
00:40:46,894 --> 00:40:49,806
Lo rimpiazzo io.

455
00:40:49,894 --> 00:40:52,249
[Guard]
He says he's a replacement.

456
00:40:52,334 --> 00:40:53,653
Parla francese?

457
00:40:53,734 --> 00:40:55,645
Non lo parlo.

458
00:40:55,734 --> 00:41:00,285
Il prigioniero
ha solo un giorno al mese

459
00:41:00,374 --> 00:41:03,207
per la confessione.

460
00:41:03,294 --> 00:41:07,253
He says the prisoners
gets Confession once a month.

461
00:41:07,334 --> 00:41:09,211
The usual priest is sick.

462
00:41:17,134 --> 00:41:19,523
Vai, vai! Avanti!

463
00:41:27,734 --> 00:41:28,849
Grazie.

464
00:41:28,934 --> 00:41:30,765
Grazie tanto, signore.

465
00:41:30,854 --> 00:41:32,685
Grazie. Grazie.

466
00:41:34,374 --> 00:41:37,332
It is my Confession day.

467
00:41:45,054 --> 00:41:48,683
I'm sorry. You've never
seen me before.

468
00:41:48,774 --> 00:41:50,048
I must shock you.

469
00:41:53,734 --> 00:41:55,213
I am a friend.

470
00:41:55,294 --> 00:41:58,206
I am here to help you.

471
00:42:02,894 --> 00:42:04,566
What are you doing?

472
00:42:04,654 --> 00:42:07,805
It is your escape to freedom.

473
00:42:15,174 --> 00:42:16,687
Who is this?

474
00:42:16,774 --> 00:42:19,607
He is you.

475
00:42:25,174 --> 00:42:27,688
Signore, scusi, scusi!

476
00:42:27,774 --> 00:42:29,730
Signore!

477
00:42:29,814 --> 00:42:32,453
Ehi, ehi! Signore, scusi!

478
00:42:36,254 --> 00:42:37,846
Cosa c'è?

479
00:42:37,934 --> 00:42:42,246
È caduto stecchito
mentre leggevo la messa.

480
00:42:42,334 --> 00:42:44,894
He says he fell stone dead

481
00:42:44,974 --> 00:42:47,886
as he was reading him the Mass.

482
00:42:47,974 --> 00:42:51,967
[Guard]
How could he just keel over?

483
00:42:52,054 --> 00:42:55,524
Ha la peste.
Come I'altro prete.

484
00:42:55,614 --> 00:42:59,368
He says the prisoner
had a fever, like the priest.

485
00:42:59,454 --> 00:43:02,332
Plague? They brought
plague in here?

486
00:43:02,414 --> 00:43:05,326
Get him out! Get him out now!

487
00:43:05,414 --> 00:43:08,053
No last rites! Get away!

488
00:43:12,214 --> 00:43:17,163
We could chisel it off
and see who it was.

489
00:43:18,694 --> 00:43:20,650
No one will ever know.

490
00:43:20,734 --> 00:43:22,292
Bruciatelo!

491
00:43:22,374 --> 00:43:25,286
O la peste ci colpirà tutti!

492
00:43:25,374 --> 00:43:28,571
He says burn it
or we will all get plague.

493
00:43:28,654 --> 00:43:30,292
He's right!

494
00:43:30,374 --> 00:43:33,047
Dio! Dio, Dio...

495
00:43:34,414 --> 00:43:37,326
Don't touch me!

496
00:43:37,414 --> 00:43:39,132
Get out!

497
00:43:41,694 --> 00:43:44,367
Stay back! He has plague.

498
00:43:44,454 --> 00:43:46,365
Hurry up!

499
00:43:46,454 --> 00:43:48,251
Via!

500
00:43:51,654 --> 00:43:54,214
Hurry, hurry, hurry!

501
00:43:54,294 --> 00:43:56,649
Go away! Hurry!

502
00:44:38,454 --> 00:44:40,331
My God!

503
00:44:49,694 --> 00:44:52,652
[Horses' hooves]

504
00:45:07,734 --> 00:45:09,213
Whoah!

505
00:45:15,254 --> 00:45:17,006
[Aramis] Jesuits. They're mine.

506
00:45:18,731 --> 00:45:19,291
[Clang of metal, cry of pain]

507
00:45:19,291 --> 00:45:21,600
[Clang of metal, cry of pain]

508
00:47:17,451 --> 00:47:20,443
[He collapses]

509
00:47:31,811 --> 00:47:32,960
Here...

510
00:47:35,011 --> 00:47:36,922
Drink.

511
00:47:42,011 --> 00:47:43,729
It's all right.

512
00:47:52,931 --> 00:47:55,126
I have waited six years

513
00:47:55,211 --> 00:47:57,850
to ask this question...

514
00:48:00,011 --> 00:48:02,400
Why was this done to me?

515
00:48:03,571 --> 00:48:05,163
You don't know?

516
00:48:07,211 --> 00:48:09,281
What do you remember?

517
00:48:09,371 --> 00:48:12,044
I lived in a country house.

518
00:48:12,131 --> 00:48:14,042
I had guardians.

519
00:48:14,131 --> 00:48:17,043
An old woman and a priest.

520
00:48:17,131 --> 00:48:19,042
But no friends.

521
00:48:19,131 --> 00:48:22,567
They took me to the prison.

522
00:48:22,651 --> 00:48:25,768
- Who?
- A man in black.

523
00:48:25,851 --> 00:48:28,319
I never saw his face...

524
00:48:30,211 --> 00:48:32,645
but he took me to the prison

525
00:48:32,731 --> 00:48:36,485
and he put me into the mask.

526
00:48:36,571 --> 00:48:38,368
And you don't know why?

527
00:48:38,451 --> 00:48:41,887
For days I shouted,
"What have I done?"

528
00:48:44,571 --> 00:48:47,529
Then I realised there was
something about my face

529
00:48:47,611 --> 00:48:49,010
which had to be hidden.

530
00:48:49,091 --> 00:48:51,969
But I never knew what.

531
00:48:52,051 --> 00:48:54,121
What is your name?

532
00:48:54,211 --> 00:48:58,329
The old woman called me...

533
00:48:58,411 --> 00:49:00,402
Phillippe.

534
00:49:00,531 --> 00:49:02,647
Phillippe...

535
00:49:04,571 --> 00:49:08,883
These men will clean you.
They won't harm you.

536
00:49:12,651 --> 00:49:13,845
Thank you.

537
00:49:17,011 --> 00:49:19,320
Thank you for your kindness.

538
00:49:28,124 --> 00:49:28,684
Why are you so glum?

539
00:49:28,684 --> 00:49:30,515
Why are you so glum?

540
00:49:30,604 --> 00:49:32,322
I expected action.

541
00:49:32,404 --> 00:49:35,316
There was no killing,
no fighting.

542
00:49:35,404 --> 00:49:37,076
I was useless.

543
00:49:37,164 --> 00:49:42,158
Porthos, I grow tired
of this attitude.

544
00:49:43,204 --> 00:49:48,324
You are surrounded by beauty,
by intrigue, by danger.

545
00:49:48,404 --> 00:49:51,316
What more can a man want?

546
00:49:51,404 --> 00:49:53,872
Look around you.

547
00:49:55,804 --> 00:49:58,443
The robins are singing,
the pigeons cooing...

548
00:49:59,644 --> 00:50:01,236
Can't you listen to their song?

549
00:50:03,364 --> 00:50:04,513
Oh...!

550
00:50:13,724 --> 00:50:16,796
There's food here, but Louis
sends it all to the army.

551
00:50:16,884 --> 00:50:18,795
I have no appetite.

552
00:50:18,884 --> 00:50:20,476
I'm wasting away.

553
00:50:20,564 --> 00:50:23,476
Even women don't
interest me any more.

554
00:50:23,564 --> 00:50:25,998
Say goodbye to Porthos.

555
00:50:26,084 --> 00:50:28,552
He is gone.

556
00:50:36,764 --> 00:50:38,755
Who is he?

557
00:50:38,804 --> 00:50:42,763
Seek the truth, not facts.

558
00:50:42,844 --> 00:50:44,755
You are not my priest!

559
00:50:44,844 --> 00:50:47,153
And wouldn't be
even if I had one!

560
00:50:47,244 --> 00:50:48,962
That's bitter.

561
00:50:50,684 --> 00:50:53,596
The loss of Raoul
and d'Artagnan,

562
00:50:53,684 --> 00:50:58,633
who you held as a brother
and now you hate.

563
00:50:58,724 --> 00:51:01,397
What right have you to judge me?

564
00:51:01,484 --> 00:51:04,203
Are you holier
than everyone else?

565
00:51:04,284 --> 00:51:08,721
Yes, and I'm more intelligent
than anybody else.

566
00:51:08,844 --> 00:51:11,722
[Porthos yells in pain]

567
00:51:13,724 --> 00:51:15,396
Porthos, what is it?

568
00:51:15,484 --> 00:51:17,202
Kidney stones.

569
00:51:17,284 --> 00:51:19,240
It hurts when I piss.

570
00:51:19,324 --> 00:51:21,235
It hurts when I shit.

571
00:51:21,324 --> 00:51:25,442
I'm just a fat old fart
with nothing to live for.

572
00:51:25,524 --> 00:51:27,401
I'm going to hang myself

573
00:51:27,484 --> 00:51:29,395
as soon as I'm sober.

574
00:51:29,484 --> 00:51:30,883
Come on!

575
00:51:30,964 --> 00:51:33,558
Aramis! He is ready!

576
00:52:00,149 --> 00:52:03,266
The greatest mystery of life...

577
00:52:03,349 --> 00:52:05,943
is who we truly are.

578
00:52:06,029 --> 00:52:08,020
Yes.

579
00:52:09,989 --> 00:52:13,948
I will tell you the secret
that was kept from you.

580
00:52:14,029 --> 00:52:18,580
[Aramis] It began the night
King Louis was born.

581
00:52:18,669 --> 00:52:20,625
D'Artagnan, Athos
and I were dining.

582
00:52:20,709 --> 00:52:22,222
D'Artagnan was drunk -

583
00:52:22,309 --> 00:52:24,743
the only time
I've seen him like that.

584
00:52:24,829 --> 00:52:26,865
[Aramis] I was on duty.

585
00:52:26,949 --> 00:52:30,180
I was summoned to the
rear door of the palace.

586
00:52:30,269 --> 00:52:34,148
The Queen's priest
handed me a baby.

587
00:52:34,229 --> 00:52:36,982
Do you understand this, Athos?

588
00:52:37,069 --> 00:52:39,537
The Queen had given
birth to twins.

589
00:52:39,629 --> 00:52:43,986
The child I carried
was the younger of the two.

590
00:52:44,069 --> 00:52:45,627
[Baby cries]

591
00:52:45,709 --> 00:52:47,745
[Man] Another!

592
00:52:47,869 --> 00:52:50,144
[Echo] It's another.

593
00:52:50,269 --> 00:52:53,579
[Two babies cry]

594
00:52:53,669 --> 00:52:55,864
The King realised
he had two heirs.

595
00:52:55,949 --> 00:52:59,225
He'd seen brothers
tear apart enough kingdoms

596
00:52:59,309 --> 00:53:03,188
that he decided to make one
disappear. You, Phillippe!

597
00:53:03,269 --> 00:53:06,898
He ordered your identity
kept from you.

598
00:53:06,989 --> 00:53:09,423
On his deathbed,
he revealed the truth to Louis

599
00:53:09,509 --> 00:53:11,101
and your mother.

600
00:53:11,189 --> 00:53:14,022
She had been told
you died at birth.

601
00:53:14,109 --> 00:53:17,863
She blamed herself
for believing it.

602
00:53:17,949 --> 00:53:21,464
She wished to restore
your birthright.

603
00:53:21,549 --> 00:53:23,460
But now, Louis was King.

604
00:53:23,549 --> 00:53:25,540
He was afraid to kill you,

605
00:53:25,629 --> 00:53:27,938
for his claim to power

606
00:53:28,029 --> 00:53:30,862
rested on the sanctity
of royal blood.

607
00:53:30,949 --> 00:53:32,860
So he devised a way

608
00:53:32,949 --> 00:53:35,383
to keep you forever hidden.

609
00:53:37,109 --> 00:53:41,102
For my country, for my king...

610
00:53:41,189 --> 00:53:45,979
I bought peace with your life

611
00:53:46,069 --> 00:53:48,025
and with my soul.

612
00:53:49,549 --> 00:53:54,464
One day...l will
ask your forgiveness.

613
00:53:56,709 --> 00:54:01,066
But not until I have
restored you to what is yours.

614
00:54:01,149 --> 00:54:02,582
Restored?

615
00:54:02,669 --> 00:54:05,024
We will replace Louis
with Phillippe.

616
00:54:05,109 --> 00:54:06,986
That is your plan?

617
00:54:07,069 --> 00:54:09,503
Exchanging one for the other?

618
00:54:09,589 --> 00:54:10,863
It's ludicrous!

619
00:54:10,949 --> 00:54:13,861
It's brilliant. What did
you think we were up to?

620
00:54:13,949 --> 00:54:16,099
Revolution, open war!

621
00:54:16,189 --> 00:54:17,508
Blood in the streets.

622
00:54:17,589 --> 00:54:19,307
At least it's a change.

623
00:54:19,389 --> 00:54:22,779
Physical resemblance is a start,
but Louis' arrogance...

624
00:54:22,869 --> 00:54:24,541
[Aramis] ..can be adopted!

625
00:54:24,629 --> 00:54:26,540
[Athos] And people close to him?

626
00:54:26,629 --> 00:54:28,779
I have considered everything.

627
00:54:28,869 --> 00:54:33,306
Have you considered
you not only risk our lives,

628
00:54:33,389 --> 00:54:35,061
you risk Phillippe's as well?

629
00:54:35,149 --> 00:54:38,300
And like us, he has a choice.

630
00:54:39,989 --> 00:54:42,344
What about it, Phillippe?

631
00:54:42,429 --> 00:54:47,184
All those years in prison,
were they for nothing?

632
00:54:47,269 --> 00:54:52,138
Or have they given you strength
unlike ordinary men?

633
00:54:52,229 --> 00:54:55,141
You have the chance to be king,

634
00:54:55,229 --> 00:54:58,665
if you have the heart
to take that chance,

635
00:54:58,749 --> 00:55:01,900
you have the heart.

636
00:55:01,989 --> 00:55:03,058
Do you?

637
00:55:03,229 --> 00:55:06,221
I...l...

638
00:55:12,509 --> 00:55:14,465
Do you?

639
00:55:46,110 --> 00:55:47,429
Your Majesty!

640
00:55:47,510 --> 00:55:50,422
A box has arrived

641
00:55:50,510 --> 00:55:53,980
whose contents
are for your eyes only.

642
00:55:57,550 --> 00:55:59,461
Take this to my mother.

643
00:56:51,190 --> 00:56:53,021
[Weeping] My son!

644
00:56:53,150 --> 00:56:55,539
My son!

645
00:57:01,430 --> 00:57:04,786
Please...forgive me.

646
00:57:04,870 --> 00:57:08,226
I can never make it right.

647
00:57:09,990 --> 00:57:11,343
My Lady...

648
00:57:16,150 --> 00:57:17,344
D'Artagnan...

649
00:57:48,110 --> 00:57:49,782
No... No...

650
00:57:49,910 --> 00:57:51,502
If anyone sees...

651
00:57:51,590 --> 00:57:53,785
it is death.

652
00:57:53,870 --> 00:57:57,180
If I don't kiss you,
I'll die anyway.

653
00:58:04,510 --> 00:58:07,547
I cannot bear to see you cry.

654
00:58:09,350 --> 00:58:10,942
Please...

655
00:58:12,190 --> 00:58:14,340
Tell me what's wrong.

656
00:58:22,910 --> 00:58:24,104
Anna!

657
00:58:26,070 --> 00:58:30,461
I know that to love you
is treason against France.

658
00:58:30,550 --> 00:58:34,463
But not to love you
is treason against my heart.

659
00:58:34,550 --> 00:58:37,667
Then we will both
die traitors, d'Artagnan.

660
00:58:46,999 --> 00:58:49,069
[Aramis] More wine!

661
00:58:49,239 --> 00:58:50,877
More wine.

662
00:58:52,079 --> 00:58:54,468
How is he?

663
00:58:54,559 --> 00:58:59,679
Exhausted. He's had a long day.

664
00:58:59,759 --> 00:59:01,954
- Aramis...
- More wine!

665
00:59:02,039 --> 00:59:04,951
Consider this plan.
Phillippe is like a child.

666
00:59:05,039 --> 00:59:07,473
- He cannot be ready...
- You can do it!

667
00:59:07,559 --> 00:59:08,708
- No!
- Yes!

668
00:59:08,799 --> 00:59:11,711
- In a year maybe...
- Three weeks!

669
00:59:11,799 --> 00:59:13,471
Three weeks?!

670
00:59:13,559 --> 00:59:17,347
The King is having
a masquerade ball.

671
00:59:17,439 --> 00:59:20,078
A swirl of people,
their faces covered.

672
00:59:20,159 --> 00:59:23,117
It's a perfect opportunity.
We must act!

673
00:59:23,199 --> 00:59:25,997
Phillippe could be
discovered at any time.

674
00:59:26,079 --> 00:59:27,876
More wine! Where is everybody?

675
00:59:29,359 --> 00:59:31,953
[Porthos] No! It's no use.

676
00:59:33,199 --> 00:59:35,394
My sword is bent.

677
00:59:35,479 --> 00:59:36,878
It'll be all right.

678
00:59:36,959 --> 00:59:40,872
You're just taking
a while to get started.

679
00:59:40,959 --> 00:59:44,269
- I'll make your sword straight.
- No, it's dead.

680
00:59:44,359 --> 00:59:47,237
It's dead! I am useless!

681
00:59:47,319 --> 00:59:48,718
Useless...

682
00:59:51,759 --> 00:59:54,831
Three weeks to learn
all he must know?

683
00:59:54,919 --> 00:59:57,956
For 1 6 years, he was
educated as a gentleman.

684
00:59:58,039 --> 01:00:01,588
And for six more,
he lived in that mask!

685
01:00:01,679 --> 01:00:05,592
Now he knows that those
who should have loved him

686
01:00:05,679 --> 01:00:09,115
threw him into
loneliness and pain.

687
01:00:09,199 --> 01:00:12,350
You're fond of him. That's good.

688
01:00:12,439 --> 01:00:15,397
Don't play God with me, Aramis!

689
01:00:15,479 --> 01:00:17,470
Nothing can replace Raoul!

690
01:00:23,159 --> 01:00:24,592
What is Porthos doing?

691
01:00:24,679 --> 01:00:29,116
Walking into the barn naked,
or so it seems.

692
01:00:29,199 --> 01:00:31,155
[Athos] What is he doing?

693
01:00:31,239 --> 01:00:33,707
Going to hang himself.

694
01:00:34,679 --> 01:00:35,907
Hang himself?!

695
01:00:37,439 --> 01:00:39,350
Oh, mon Dieu!

696
01:00:39,439 --> 01:00:42,112
A sign from God...

697
01:00:42,199 --> 01:00:44,269
Oh, my God!

698
01:00:50,759 --> 01:00:55,355
If Porthos is determined
to end his life,

699
01:00:55,439 --> 01:00:57,350
he'll find the opportunity.

700
01:01:02,159 --> 01:01:04,468
Goodbye, cruel world.

701
01:01:04,559 --> 01:01:08,154
Farewell to useless Porthos.

702
01:01:15,559 --> 01:01:18,551
- What was that?
- I sawed the beam.

703
01:01:23,319 --> 01:01:25,753
I'm a genius,
not an engineer.

704
01:01:33,239 --> 01:01:36,709
ARAMIS! You did this!

705
01:01:36,799 --> 01:01:39,871
You knew I'd hang myself
and you sawed the beam!

706
01:01:39,959 --> 01:01:42,427
- Admit it!
- Of course I knew.

707
01:01:42,519 --> 01:01:44,510
You've been moping around
for months.

708
01:01:44,599 --> 01:01:49,070
Now you can stop boring
everyone and be useful!

709
01:01:51,119 --> 01:01:54,111
- Well...all right.
- Put some clothes on!

710
01:02:18,472 --> 01:02:21,384
I've worn this mask so long,

711
01:02:21,472 --> 01:02:23,906
I don't feel safe without it.

712
01:02:23,992 --> 01:02:25,948
I will sit with you.

713
01:02:26,032 --> 01:02:28,023
I can't sleep either.

714
01:04:09,512 --> 01:04:11,946
I've been in prison
for six years.

715
01:04:12,032 --> 01:04:14,307
You have freed me.

716
01:04:16,712 --> 01:04:20,671
Now you ask me
to enter another prison.

717
01:04:20,752 --> 01:04:23,425
A palace is hardly a prison.

718
01:04:25,512 --> 01:04:28,549
Do you see
those farm maids?

719
01:04:28,632 --> 01:04:31,544
See the one holding the lamb?

720
01:04:31,632 --> 01:04:34,465
I would tend lambs with her
the rest of my life.

721
01:04:34,552 --> 01:04:38,591
We're offering you
a chance to be king.

722
01:04:38,672 --> 01:04:43,382
No, you offer me a chance
to pretend to be king!

723
01:04:43,472 --> 01:04:47,863
A king you hate!

724
01:04:47,952 --> 01:04:49,704
Not everyone hates him.

725
01:04:49,792 --> 01:04:51,783
Don't you?

726
01:04:54,512 --> 01:04:56,423
Why should I become him?

727
01:04:56,512 --> 01:05:01,142
Until you give me
a reason, I won't.

728
01:05:01,232 --> 01:05:03,302
I cannot.

729
01:05:03,392 --> 01:05:07,021
We're all God's instruments,
like it or not.

730
01:05:07,112 --> 01:05:09,182
All we can do is keep faith.

731
01:05:09,272 --> 01:05:12,309
Though I sometimes
find that hard.

732
01:05:12,392 --> 01:05:14,826
We all fail at faith, Aramis.

733
01:05:14,912 --> 01:05:19,861
That's why we must eat,
drink, and make love to life.

734
01:05:19,952 --> 01:05:23,422
As king, you can have
a thousand ploughmaids.

735
01:05:23,512 --> 01:05:25,468
Porthos! You miss the point!

736
01:05:25,552 --> 01:05:27,031
What point?

737
01:05:27,112 --> 01:05:28,989
Phillippe is right.

738
01:05:29,072 --> 01:05:31,222
We haven't given him a reason

739
01:05:31,312 --> 01:05:33,587
to do what we ask.

740
01:05:33,672 --> 01:05:35,628
I understand
your reason, Athos.

741
01:05:35,712 --> 01:05:37,543
You do?

742
01:05:37,632 --> 01:05:39,941
Porthos told me about your son.

743
01:05:43,232 --> 01:05:45,746
You think that's why I'm here?

744
01:05:48,152 --> 01:05:52,464
Yes, Raoul is my reason,
but not the way you think.

745
01:05:52,552 --> 01:05:55,112
Once, all of us believed

746
01:05:55,192 --> 01:05:58,662
in serving something
greater than ourselves.

747
01:05:58,752 --> 01:06:00,629
Aramis had his faith.

748
01:06:00,712 --> 01:06:03,624
Porthos, his lust for life.

749
01:06:03,712 --> 01:06:05,589
D'Artagnan, his devotion.

750
01:06:05,672 --> 01:06:07,390
And I had Raoul.

751
01:06:07,472 --> 01:06:10,384
But we all had a common dream -

752
01:06:10,472 --> 01:06:13,908
that one day we would
be able to serve a king

753
01:06:13,992 --> 01:06:16,460
worthy of the throne.

754
01:06:16,552 --> 01:06:19,510
It is what we dreamt,

755
01:06:19,592 --> 01:06:22,345
what we bled for,

756
01:06:22,432 --> 01:06:25,981
and what we have waited
a lifetime for.

757
01:06:26,072 --> 01:06:30,463
I taught Raoul
to believe in that dream.

758
01:06:30,552 --> 01:06:33,112
And now my son is dead.

759
01:06:35,312 --> 01:06:40,750
So I am here to find out
if his life was in vain.

760
01:06:40,832 --> 01:06:45,986
And the only one who can
answer that question is you.

761
01:07:01,752 --> 01:07:03,026
Athos...

762
01:07:03,112 --> 01:07:05,580
if we fail in this attempt -

763
01:07:05,672 --> 01:07:08,869
and we probably will -

764
01:07:08,952 --> 01:07:12,388
I am honoured to die beside you.

765
01:07:16,672 --> 01:07:17,991
And you.

766
01:08:27,207 --> 01:08:29,675
This arrived for you.

767
01:08:35,007 --> 01:08:37,077
[Raoul's voice]
'My darling Christine,

768
01:08:37,167 --> 01:08:39,601
'in parting from you

769
01:08:39,687 --> 01:08:42,599
'l have left heaven for hell.

770
01:08:42,687 --> 01:08:46,600
'l go because I can love you
only in honour.

771
01:08:46,687 --> 01:08:51,602
'You've created in me
the need to be a better man.

772
01:08:51,687 --> 01:08:54,599
'l will love
through heaven or hell

773
01:08:54,687 --> 01:08:58,236
'to love you
as you should be loved.

774
01:08:58,327 --> 01:09:01,922
'Remember that
and give yourself no blame.

775
01:09:02,007 --> 01:09:05,158
'Yours forever, Raoul.'

776
01:09:30,087 --> 01:09:31,236
What's wrong?

777
01:09:36,567 --> 01:09:38,523
What's the matter?

778
01:09:47,087 --> 01:09:48,918
What's wrong?

779
01:09:49,007 --> 01:09:52,204
I received a letter
from Raoul.

780
01:09:52,287 --> 01:09:55,484
He sent it to the palace,

781
01:09:55,567 --> 01:09:58,001
knowing that he would die

782
01:09:58,087 --> 01:10:00,476
and that I would be here.

783
01:10:02,647 --> 01:10:04,603
How would he know that?

784
01:10:07,287 --> 01:10:12,645
I...l can't guess
what he was thinking.

785
01:10:12,727 --> 01:10:14,683
He was irrational.

786
01:10:14,767 --> 01:10:18,726
I ordered him placed
far from the fighting...

787
01:10:21,047 --> 01:10:24,756
but he plunged in
against my wishes.

788
01:10:24,847 --> 01:10:29,284
He forgives me for all
that he knew I would do.

789
01:10:29,367 --> 01:10:31,835
But how can I forgive myself?

790
01:10:31,927 --> 01:10:33,326
Forgive?

791
01:10:34,487 --> 01:10:36,364
I loved him , Louis.

792
01:10:36,447 --> 01:10:39,166
I love him still.

793
01:10:46,087 --> 01:10:47,566
Still...

794
01:10:47,647 --> 01:10:51,401
And in pretending to love you,
I do something awful.

795
01:10:54,487 --> 01:10:56,398
You pretend?!

796
01:10:59,967 --> 01:11:02,879
I have sinned
against love and God

797
01:11:02,967 --> 01:11:04,719
for the sake of your mercy,

798
01:11:04,807 --> 01:11:08,243
which you would not
have given without my sin.

799
01:11:08,327 --> 01:11:12,366
I will burn in hell
and so will you.

800
01:11:12,607 --> 01:11:14,404
No. No, no.

801
01:11:15,527 --> 01:11:17,199
No, my love.

802
01:11:18,567 --> 01:11:20,717
You will burn in hell,

803
01:11:20,807 --> 01:11:23,241
but I will not,

804
01:11:23,327 --> 01:11:27,764
for I am King, ordained by God.

805
01:11:40,048 --> 01:11:40,648
[Horses hooves]

806
01:11:40,648 --> 01:11:41,967
[Horses hooves]

807
01:11:43,048 --> 01:11:46,279
[Aramis]
Come on! We have to get started.

808
01:11:47,648 --> 01:11:49,286
- Get my bag.
- Where do you go?

809
01:11:49,368 --> 01:11:52,280
Paris. I'll be gone a few days.

810
01:11:52,368 --> 01:11:55,121
Make sure everything
is ready when I return.

811
01:11:55,208 --> 01:11:58,359
You want me to do
the impossible alone?

812
01:11:58,448 --> 01:12:02,885
This is the perfect solution -
a revolution without bloodshed.

813
01:12:02,968 --> 01:12:05,846
Or treason -
for he is a king's son.

814
01:12:05,928 --> 01:12:08,362
I can't get him ready in time!

815
01:12:08,448 --> 01:12:10,803
The urgency is not my choice.

816
01:12:10,888 --> 01:12:13,243
Instead of distributing food,

817
01:12:13,328 --> 01:12:15,478
Louis has ordered
the rioters shot.

818
01:12:15,568 --> 01:12:17,479
Imagine what will happen

819
01:12:17,568 --> 01:12:21,038
when the starving people
hear about this ball.

820
01:12:21,128 --> 01:12:23,801
This is not for me, Athos.

821
01:12:23,888 --> 01:12:26,482
It's for everything
we once were...

822
01:12:26,568 --> 01:12:28,524
and might be again.

823
01:12:46,568 --> 01:12:48,286
Thank you, Father.

824
01:12:48,368 --> 01:12:50,643
The ball is now tomorrow night.

825
01:12:50,728 --> 01:12:53,686
Louis is unhappy
with his mistress

826
01:12:53,768 --> 01:12:56,043
and needs revelry.

827
01:12:56,128 --> 01:12:58,517
My tailors must work all night!

828
01:12:58,608 --> 01:12:59,882
Saddle my horse!

829
01:13:09,808 --> 01:13:12,242
The brothel is closed
for the night.

830
01:13:12,328 --> 01:13:15,320
Everyone out,
except the ladies. OUT!

831
01:13:15,408 --> 01:13:17,717
Closed? We came here...

832
01:13:17,808 --> 01:13:19,958
Go somewhere else.

833
01:13:20,048 --> 01:13:21,640
Out! Out!

834
01:13:21,728 --> 01:13:24,561
You must finish
the clothes you were making.

835
01:13:24,648 --> 01:13:27,082
We'll go, and take
your money with us!

836
01:13:27,168 --> 01:13:29,204
Come on, old man!

837
01:13:29,288 --> 01:13:34,078
Old? You try to rob me
because you think me old?

838
01:13:34,208 --> 01:13:35,323
Oh...!

839
01:13:43,888 --> 01:13:48,518
See if you can rob someone
with your pistol up there!

840
01:13:48,608 --> 01:13:50,121
Out! Everybody out!

841
01:13:50,208 --> 01:13:52,278
Out! Get out!

842
01:13:52,368 --> 01:13:56,327
Porthos,
I finished this for you.

843
01:13:56,408 --> 01:13:59,206
I love Paris! I love life!

844
01:13:59,288 --> 01:14:01,927
And I love you, ladies!

845
01:14:02,008 --> 01:14:04,761
Now get busy - except for you!

846
01:14:04,848 --> 01:14:06,281
Come!

847
01:14:08,448 --> 01:14:09,847
No, wait.

848
01:14:09,928 --> 01:14:11,839
With a king, it is so.

849
01:14:11,928 --> 01:14:14,567
Servants have
touched the goblet,

850
01:14:14,648 --> 01:14:17,242
so the king touches
as little as possible.

851
01:14:17,328 --> 01:14:18,283
Again...

852
01:14:23,088 --> 01:14:24,521
I'm sorry.

853
01:14:24,608 --> 01:14:26,997
No, do not be sorry!

854
01:14:27,088 --> 01:14:30,364
There are no mistakes
when you are king.

855
01:14:30,448 --> 01:14:32,325
You never apologise.

856
01:14:32,408 --> 01:14:35,127
The king cares for
nothing and for no one.

857
01:14:35,208 --> 01:14:38,166
Is that the king
you wish me to be?

858
01:14:38,248 --> 01:14:42,719
Or do you say this
because your son is dead?

859
01:14:48,888 --> 01:14:51,322
Forgive me. I did not mean...

860
01:14:51,408 --> 01:14:54,559
I am not angry with you.
Do you understand?

861
01:14:56,688 --> 01:15:01,045
Good. Of course we wish you
to be a good king,

862
01:15:01,128 --> 01:15:05,041
but first you must pass as
Louis, who is cold and cruel.

863
01:15:05,128 --> 01:15:08,564
His eyes say he cares
only for himself.

864
01:15:08,648 --> 01:15:11,208
Your eyes ask too much.

865
01:15:11,488 --> 01:15:14,525
You shouldn't care about me.

866
01:15:15,208 --> 01:15:17,597
You shouldn't care about...

867
01:15:19,568 --> 01:15:22,287
You mustn't ask about my son.

868
01:15:31,168 --> 01:15:34,604
[Queen Anne] Bless me, Father,
for I have sinned.

869
01:15:36,568 --> 01:15:39,002
And so have l.

870
01:15:39,088 --> 01:15:40,487
Aramis!

871
01:15:40,688 --> 01:15:42,804
Your Majesty.

872
01:15:42,888 --> 01:15:45,083
Do you believe

873
01:15:45,168 --> 01:15:48,717
that just as one can lie
can destroy a life,

874
01:15:48,808 --> 01:15:52,278
one truth can put it
together again?

875
01:15:52,368 --> 01:15:55,280
I pray every day
for such a miracle.

876
01:15:55,368 --> 01:15:58,280
I have prayed every day
for forgiveness.

877
01:15:58,368 --> 01:16:00,836
But forgiveness
must come from you

878
01:16:00,928 --> 01:16:03,283
before it can come from God.

879
01:16:03,368 --> 01:16:06,678
It was I who took
your other son from you.

880
01:16:06,768 --> 01:16:11,637
And I was never brave enough
to find the truth.

881
01:16:11,728 --> 01:16:15,038
I have raised a son
who destroys lives

882
01:16:15,128 --> 01:16:17,403
instead of saving them.

883
01:16:17,488 --> 01:16:20,958
And I have failed to save a son

884
01:16:21,048 --> 01:16:23,846
who died within an iron mask.

885
01:16:23,928 --> 01:16:27,204
No! That mask
was Louis' creation.

886
01:16:27,288 --> 01:16:30,200
Now we have a chance
to make a miracle -

887
01:16:30,288 --> 01:16:33,360
to strip all masks away forever.

888
01:16:35,808 --> 01:16:37,719
These rooms are yours.

889
01:16:37,808 --> 01:16:40,197
Through this corridor
and upstairs,

890
01:16:40,288 --> 01:16:42,802
or through this passage,

891
01:16:42,888 --> 01:16:45,482
are the rooms of your
mistress Christine.

892
01:16:45,568 --> 01:16:46,921
And whose rooms are these?

893
01:16:49,048 --> 01:16:50,367
Your mother's.

894
01:16:53,088 --> 01:16:55,079
My mother's...?

895
01:17:01,168 --> 01:17:03,204
Change the horses!

896
01:17:06,328 --> 01:17:09,559
Clear everything out!

897
01:17:09,648 --> 01:17:10,763
Now!

898
01:17:19,888 --> 01:17:22,800
[Aramis] Remember, Phillippe:
nobility is born in the heart.

899
01:17:22,888 --> 01:17:27,803
[Porthos] Make love as if you
don't care. Fart when you wish.

900
01:17:27,888 --> 01:17:31,324
[Athos] Hold your goblet
with two fingers.

901
01:17:31,408 --> 01:17:34,923
If you get stuck,
just say "Continue."

902
01:17:35,008 --> 01:17:36,964
[Aramis] ln the morning,

903
01:17:37,048 --> 01:17:41,405
order that we be brought
to the palace as your advisors.

904
01:18:22,537 --> 01:18:24,050
D'Artagnan watches everything!

905
01:18:24,137 --> 01:18:26,571
We will need luck.

906
01:18:26,657 --> 01:18:28,568
We will make our own luck!

907
01:18:28,657 --> 01:18:30,090
If Phillippe holds up.

908
01:18:30,177 --> 01:18:33,249
Relax, Phillippe!
You're doing well.

909
01:18:50,777 --> 01:18:52,415
My brother!

910
01:19:11,897 --> 01:19:13,967
What is wrong, Your Majesty?.

911
01:19:16,777 --> 01:19:18,733
Nothing. Carry on.

912
01:19:32,537 --> 01:19:34,448
Did you see that?

913
01:19:35,537 --> 01:19:37,653
What, Your Majesty?

914
01:19:37,737 --> 01:19:39,932
A mask! I saw a mask!

915
01:19:40,017 --> 01:19:43,453
The ballroom is full
of masks, Your Majesty.

916
01:20:09,377 --> 01:20:11,766
[Music stops]

917
01:20:11,857 --> 01:20:13,495
Your Majesty?

918
01:20:15,657 --> 01:20:17,648
Carry on, everyone.

919
01:20:23,657 --> 01:20:25,966
To the passageway.

920
01:20:26,097 --> 01:20:27,212
[Panicked breathing]

921
01:20:27,377 --> 01:20:30,528
Your Majesty! Your Majesty!

922
01:20:53,687 --> 01:20:56,155
It's Judgement Day.

923
01:21:10,807 --> 01:21:13,526
Don't look so shocked,
Phillippe.

924
01:21:13,607 --> 01:21:16,326
Phillippe?
Why do you call me Phillippe?

925
01:21:16,407 --> 01:21:18,921
We have a present for you.

926
01:21:20,407 --> 01:21:21,840
No!

927
01:21:36,007 --> 01:21:38,043
D'Artagnan guards the hall.

928
01:21:38,127 --> 01:21:41,563
Let us go back
the way we came.

929
01:21:41,647 --> 01:21:44,525
Time to go, Your Majesty.

930
01:21:58,727 --> 01:21:59,842
Good.

931
01:22:03,207 --> 01:22:05,675
- You know the way.
- Hm-hm.

932
01:22:31,567 --> 01:22:34,081
You have the heart of a king.

933
01:22:52,208 --> 01:22:52,688
[Music stops]

934
01:22:52,688 --> 01:22:54,087
[Music stops]

935
01:23:46,648 --> 01:23:48,445
Continue.

936
01:23:59,648 --> 01:24:01,604
[Courtier] Your Majesty?

937
01:24:04,688 --> 01:24:06,838
Some refreshments, Your Majesty?

938
01:24:26,968 --> 01:24:29,721
[Stunned silence]

939
01:24:47,368 --> 01:24:49,518
The Queen Mother!

940
01:26:00,528 --> 01:26:02,837
God bless the King
and Queen Mother!

941
01:26:02,928 --> 01:26:05,442
God bless the King
and Queen Mother!

942
01:26:45,168 --> 01:26:47,602
I retire now.

943
01:26:47,688 --> 01:26:49,360
Wait two dances,

944
01:26:49,448 --> 01:26:51,484
then withdraw to your room

945
01:26:51,568 --> 01:26:54,446
and spend the night in safety.

946
01:26:54,528 --> 01:26:56,723
We have much to talk about.

947
01:26:56,808 --> 01:27:00,244
And the rest of
our lives to do it.

948
01:27:00,328 --> 01:27:02,717
Goodnight...

949
01:27:06,008 --> 01:27:07,487
Mother.

950
01:27:09,048 --> 01:27:10,879
Goodnight...

951
01:27:12,848 --> 01:27:14,566
my son.

952
01:27:34,808 --> 01:27:36,685
Anne...

953
01:27:37,328 --> 01:27:39,125
Tomorrow.

954
01:27:56,408 --> 01:27:59,241
How long has the King been back?

955
01:27:59,328 --> 01:28:00,807
Some while, Captain.

956
01:28:14,766 --> 01:28:16,165
[Christine] Murderer.

957
01:28:17,446 --> 01:28:19,038
Murderer!

958
01:28:20,486 --> 01:28:21,601
Christine?

959
01:28:21,686 --> 01:28:25,565
I wrote to the front
under your seal.

960
01:28:25,646 --> 01:28:30,640
I demanded to know why the
general disregarded the order

961
01:28:30,726 --> 01:28:33,320
to keep Raoul out of danger.

962
01:28:33,406 --> 01:28:35,124
He writes back:

963
01:28:35,206 --> 01:28:36,764
'But, Your Majesty!

964
01:28:36,846 --> 01:28:39,758
'Your letter ordered me
to place him

965
01:28:39,846 --> 01:28:41,837
'at the vanguard of the assault

966
01:28:41,926 --> 01:28:44,360
'in front of the cannon.'

967
01:28:44,446 --> 01:28:46,004
You killed Raoul!

968
01:28:46,166 --> 01:28:49,203
You killed Raoul!
You killed Raoul!

969
01:28:49,366 --> 01:28:51,436
Let her go! You're hurting her!

970
01:29:03,006 --> 01:29:06,476
However I have wronged you,
I will make amends.

971
01:29:24,686 --> 01:29:27,120
Take her to her room.

972
01:29:31,046 --> 01:29:33,958
Deploy the Musketeers!
Guard the passages!

973
01:29:37,286 --> 01:29:38,719
Continue.

974
01:29:47,406 --> 01:29:51,285
We have an emergency
of security, Your Majesty.

975
01:29:51,366 --> 01:29:54,324
I must ask you to accompany me.

976
01:29:54,406 --> 01:30:00,595
Not now. The ball...
My guests...

977
01:30:01,966 --> 01:30:04,799
I insist...Your Majesty.

978
01:30:07,686 --> 01:30:09,836
Yes, certainly.

979
01:30:42,756 --> 01:30:46,669
- They've raised the alarm!
- They'll try to cut us off.

980
01:31:39,476 --> 01:31:40,909
I am Porthos!

981
01:31:42,476 --> 01:31:44,273
And I fight the King!

982
01:31:55,236 --> 01:31:57,033
Look out!

983
01:31:57,116 --> 01:31:59,550
Come on! Porthos!

984
01:32:02,156 --> 01:32:03,305
Come on!

985
01:32:05,236 --> 01:32:06,715
Everyone pump!

986
01:32:09,236 --> 01:32:12,831
Stop them before
they reach the river!

987
01:33:14,146 --> 01:33:15,943
Pull them back!

988
01:33:17,826 --> 01:33:21,580
This man...is an imposter.

989
01:33:21,666 --> 01:33:24,783
This is the imposter.

990
01:33:27,306 --> 01:33:28,625
Pull them back.

991
01:33:38,186 --> 01:33:40,541
Get in the boat, Your Majesty.

992
01:33:48,626 --> 01:33:50,059
Open the gate!

993
01:33:52,346 --> 01:33:54,064
Open the gate!

994
01:33:55,546 --> 01:33:56,979
Open the gate.

995
01:33:58,586 --> 01:34:00,975
I'm sorry. I failed you.

996
01:34:04,466 --> 01:34:06,900
We failed you.

997
01:34:19,186 --> 01:34:20,460
Stop!

998
01:34:28,386 --> 01:34:30,138
You take my king...

999
01:34:30,226 --> 01:34:32,786
I shall take yours.

1000
01:34:47,666 --> 01:34:49,577
[Louis] Get him! Get him!

1001
01:34:49,666 --> 01:34:52,544
Seize the imposter!

1002
01:34:53,626 --> 01:34:55,537
- Get him!
- Sire!

1003
01:34:55,626 --> 01:34:57,457
Seize him!

1004
01:35:01,226 --> 01:35:02,181
Phillippe!

1005
01:35:03,666 --> 01:35:06,783
Seize him! Take him!

1006
01:35:09,786 --> 01:35:12,254
- Hold on to him!
- Athos!

1007
01:35:12,346 --> 01:35:14,257
ATHOS!

1008
01:35:47,352 --> 01:35:50,469
I was told this
imposter was dead.

1009
01:35:51,552 --> 01:35:53,463
You knew?

1010
01:35:53,552 --> 01:35:58,307
You knew there was a man
of such resemblance?

1011
01:35:58,392 --> 01:35:59,825
He is my brother.

1012
01:35:59,912 --> 01:36:02,824
- Brother?
- My twin.

1013
01:36:02,912 --> 01:36:04,982
My blood.

1014
01:36:05,072 --> 01:36:09,190
A fact which has
kept him alive, until now.

1015
01:36:12,232 --> 01:36:13,551
Phillippe!

1016
01:36:16,112 --> 01:36:18,501
Louis! Please!

1017
01:36:18,592 --> 01:36:20,628
You were a part
of this, Mother?

1018
01:36:20,712 --> 01:36:23,180
I love you both!

1019
01:36:23,272 --> 01:36:25,228
That has meant nothing to us!

1020
01:36:25,312 --> 01:36:27,064
It has meant something to me.

1021
01:36:29,992 --> 01:36:32,108
Your Majesty, listen to me.

1022
01:36:32,192 --> 01:36:35,582
Never once have I asked
anything for myself.

1023
01:36:37,272 --> 01:36:41,106
I ask you now - spare the life
of this man, your brother.

1024
01:36:41,192 --> 01:36:44,184
You have no right to ask this!

1025
01:36:51,032 --> 01:36:52,431
Your Majesty...

1026
01:36:52,512 --> 01:36:55,310
every day of your life,

1027
01:36:55,392 --> 01:36:57,303
I have watched over you.

1028
01:36:57,392 --> 01:37:00,350
I have bled for you.

1029
01:37:00,432 --> 01:37:02,343
I have prayed every day

1030
01:37:02,432 --> 01:37:07,506
to see you become
greater than your office.

1031
01:37:07,592 --> 01:37:11,267
Show me what my faith
and blood have purchased.

1032
01:37:11,352 --> 01:37:12,626
Show mercy.

1033
01:37:12,712 --> 01:37:15,670
You take the side of traitors?

1034
01:37:15,752 --> 01:37:19,791
This one, worst of all -
my own brother!

1035
01:37:19,872 --> 01:37:23,103
And what have you done to him?

1036
01:37:25,232 --> 01:37:27,109
For one moment...

1037
01:37:27,192 --> 01:37:29,945
I thought you had
become the king

1038
01:37:30,032 --> 01:37:32,387
I'd hoped you would be.

1039
01:37:35,792 --> 01:37:37,271
Please...

1040
01:37:37,352 --> 01:37:40,310
My Lord, may I speak?

1041
01:37:40,392 --> 01:37:42,428
I beg that you kill me.

1042
01:37:42,512 --> 01:37:46,187
I release you from any sin
in taking my life.

1043
01:37:46,272 --> 01:37:51,187
In fact, I pray God
rewards you for your mercy.

1044
01:37:51,272 --> 01:37:54,230
But, please...do not...

1045
01:37:54,312 --> 01:37:56,143
I beg you...

1046
01:37:56,232 --> 01:38:00,942
return me to the prison
where I have lived for so long.

1047
01:38:05,672 --> 01:38:07,105
D'Artagnan...

1048
01:38:07,192 --> 01:38:10,582
You will hunt down
Porthos, Athos and Aramis

1049
01:38:10,672 --> 01:38:13,630
and bring me their heads.

1050
01:38:13,712 --> 01:38:16,146
Or I will have yours.

1051
01:38:22,832 --> 01:38:24,311
As for you, my brother,

1052
01:38:24,392 --> 01:38:27,589
back to the prison you shall go,

1053
01:38:27,672 --> 01:38:30,630
and into the mask you hate.

1054
01:38:30,712 --> 01:38:33,624
Wear it until you love it.

1055
01:38:33,712 --> 01:38:35,907
And die in it!

1056
01:38:51,022 --> 01:38:51,977
Anne!

1057
01:38:53,502 --> 01:38:55,413
There were two?

1058
01:38:55,542 --> 01:38:57,373
Not one but two?

1059
01:38:57,462 --> 01:38:59,896
I couldn't tell you.

1060
01:38:59,982 --> 01:39:01,893
You had enough to bear.

1061
01:39:01,982 --> 01:39:04,052
Anne...

1062
01:39:04,182 --> 01:39:08,460
I have loved you always,
none but you.

1063
01:39:08,542 --> 01:39:11,978
No matter what happens,

1064
01:39:12,062 --> 01:39:15,213
I pray you remember that.

1065
01:39:19,342 --> 01:39:21,139
[Woman screams]

1066
01:39:26,902 --> 01:39:28,460
Christine's room.

1067
01:39:47,622 --> 01:39:49,738
Where is she?

1068
01:40:03,142 --> 01:40:05,019
Get rid of it.

1069
01:40:06,662 --> 01:40:08,573
Where are you taking me?

1070
01:40:08,662 --> 01:40:10,414
No!

1071
01:40:15,182 --> 01:40:19,141
Where are you taking me?!
Where are you taking me?!

1072
01:40:19,222 --> 01:40:21,178
Please, no! No!

1073
01:40:21,262 --> 01:40:23,776
No! No! No!

1074
01:40:23,902 --> 01:40:25,893
NO!

1075
01:40:31,862 --> 01:40:32,817
No!

1076
01:40:32,902 --> 01:40:33,812
No!

1077
01:40:33,902 --> 01:40:36,336
No-o-o-o-o!

1078
01:40:36,422 --> 01:40:39,175
No! No! No!

1079
01:40:54,702 --> 01:40:57,614
It has been done, Your Majesty.

1080
01:40:57,702 --> 01:41:00,296
When d'Artagnan returns,
watch him.

1081
01:41:00,382 --> 01:41:03,340
When he leaves again, tell me.

1082
01:41:04,502 --> 01:41:05,981
Your Majesty.

1083
01:41:14,012 --> 01:41:15,968
Nothing down here.

1084
01:41:16,052 --> 01:41:17,849
All right, this way.

1085
01:41:40,252 --> 01:41:44,245
[D'Artagnan's voice]
Phillippe is in the lower
dungeon of the Bastille.

1086
01:41:44,332 --> 01:41:48,644
At midnight, I will delay
the new guards for 1 0 minutes.

1087
01:41:48,732 --> 01:41:51,644
One for all and all for one,
d'Artagnan.

1088
01:41:51,732 --> 01:41:55,168
It is a trap,
but we have no choice.

1089
01:41:55,252 --> 01:41:59,165
If Phillippe is in the Bastille,
to the Bastille we will go.

1090
01:41:59,252 --> 01:42:01,641
I'd rather die covered in blood

1091
01:42:01,732 --> 01:42:04,690
than an old man
lying in my piss.

1092
01:42:21,652 --> 01:42:26,772
Our old uniforms,
from our days of glory.

1093
01:42:26,852 --> 01:42:30,162
I was saving them...

1094
01:42:30,252 --> 01:42:33,642
so that we could
wear them in death.

1095
01:42:34,172 --> 01:42:35,969
And so we shall!

1096
01:42:47,730 --> 01:42:49,482
Open up. We have a prisoner.

1097
01:42:58,490 --> 01:43:00,924
Take him to level three.

1098
01:43:01,010 --> 01:43:04,002
The captain will see
to the document.

1099
01:43:09,650 --> 01:43:11,322
It worked!

1100
01:43:11,410 --> 01:43:13,128
It's a prison.

1101
01:43:13,210 --> 01:43:16,680
The problems come
when we want to get out.

1102
01:43:21,890 --> 01:43:24,529
[Clock strikes]

1103
01:43:24,610 --> 01:43:27,522
Midnight. We have 1 0 minutes.

1104
01:44:15,570 --> 01:44:17,481
Down there.

1105
01:44:29,090 --> 01:44:31,809
Is this what you're looking for?

1106
01:44:36,930 --> 01:44:38,363
The key!

1107
01:44:38,450 --> 01:44:39,565
No!

1108
01:44:40,650 --> 01:44:42,686
Remember this?

1109
01:44:42,770 --> 01:44:44,920
[Musketeer]Don't be so sad.

1110
01:44:45,010 --> 01:44:47,763
There's nothing
left of him anyway.

1111
01:44:47,850 --> 01:44:50,410
He's just a snivelling,
drooling...

1112
01:44:50,490 --> 01:44:53,004
I knew you'd come!

1113
01:44:53,090 --> 01:44:55,206
We feared the mask
would destroy you.

1114
01:44:55,290 --> 01:44:57,520
I wear the mask,
it does not wear me.

1115
01:45:30,280 --> 01:45:32,953
- The courtyard is blocked.
- He lies!

1116
01:45:33,040 --> 01:45:36,396
- He's here to trap us.
- See for yourselves.

1117
01:45:39,440 --> 01:45:41,556
All that you have suffered,

1118
01:45:41,640 --> 01:45:44,313
I would gladly
have borne myself

1119
01:45:44,400 --> 01:45:47,073
to keep it from you.

1120
01:45:49,560 --> 01:45:51,437
Go to the east gate.

1121
01:45:51,520 --> 01:45:54,114
The courtyard
is filling with soldiers!

1122
01:45:54,200 --> 01:45:56,156
This way!

1123
01:46:08,720 --> 01:46:11,280
Go till you reach the river.

1124
01:46:11,360 --> 01:46:15,558
- They'll know you helped us.
- That doesn't matter. Go!

1125
01:46:22,440 --> 01:46:24,112
Fire!

1126
01:46:32,320 --> 01:46:33,833
Get that door!

1127
01:46:35,880 --> 01:46:37,154
The lock!

1128
01:46:41,080 --> 01:46:43,036
We're trapped!

1129
01:46:57,680 --> 01:46:58,829
Charge them!

1130
01:46:58,920 --> 01:47:02,196
Spare their lives if you can.

1131
01:47:40,400 --> 01:47:43,472
Cowards! Twenty men
run from four!

1132
01:47:43,560 --> 01:47:47,030
No one has the stomach
to fight the Captain.

1133
01:48:30,342 --> 01:48:32,572
[Louis] D'Artagnan!

1134
01:48:32,662 --> 01:48:35,130
I am not angry with you.

1135
01:48:35,222 --> 01:48:38,180
I knew you'd lead me to them.

1136
01:48:38,262 --> 01:48:40,776
Lay down your sword

1137
01:48:40,862 --> 01:48:43,217
and I will not punish you.

1138
01:48:43,302 --> 01:48:46,419
You can retire in peace.

1139
01:48:46,502 --> 01:48:49,380
I'll give your friends
a swift execution

1140
01:48:49,462 --> 01:48:51,453
if you surrender now.

1141
01:48:55,404 --> 01:48:57,281
You should take his offer.

1142
01:49:00,404 --> 01:49:02,395
We're dead anyway.

1143
01:49:02,484 --> 01:49:03,997
He's right, d'Artagnan.

1144
01:49:07,524 --> 01:49:08,798
[Phillippe] Wait!

1145
01:49:08,884 --> 01:49:11,478
Bargain me to Louis
for your lives.

1146
01:49:11,564 --> 01:49:13,794
You've done your best.

1147
01:49:13,884 --> 01:49:15,442
Please, let me go.

1148
01:49:18,084 --> 01:49:19,563
No.

1149
01:49:23,684 --> 01:49:25,242
I cannot do it.

1150
01:49:27,644 --> 01:49:29,555
Even if I could give up my king,

1151
01:49:33,244 --> 01:49:35,599
I could not give up...

1152
01:49:35,684 --> 01:49:37,117
my son.

1153
01:49:47,404 --> 01:49:49,759
Your son?

1154
01:49:49,844 --> 01:49:52,039
I loved your mother.

1155
01:49:52,124 --> 01:49:54,433
I love her still.

1156
01:49:56,684 --> 01:49:58,595
You are my son.

1157
01:50:03,924 --> 01:50:06,836
I never knew you existed.

1158
01:50:06,924 --> 01:50:12,362
And I never felt pride
as a father...

1159
01:50:15,364 --> 01:50:17,320
until this moment.

1160
01:50:28,164 --> 01:50:29,802
[Banging]

1161
01:50:39,450 --> 01:50:41,008
D'Artagnan...

1162
01:50:42,090 --> 01:50:44,479
They're young Musketeers.

1163
01:50:44,570 --> 01:50:48,165
They've been weaned
on our legends.

1164
01:50:48,250 --> 01:50:51,048
They revere us!

1165
01:50:51,130 --> 01:50:55,726
- It is an advantage.
- Yes. Why don't we charge them?

1166
01:50:55,810 --> 01:50:58,165
I trained these men.

1167
01:50:58,250 --> 01:51:01,083
They will fight to the death.

1168
01:51:02,730 --> 01:51:04,368
But if we must die...

1169
01:51:04,450 --> 01:51:06,281
if we must die,

1170
01:51:06,370 --> 01:51:08,759
Iet it be like this.

1171
01:51:16,650 --> 01:51:17,719
One for all...

1172
01:51:17,810 --> 01:51:19,163
All for one.

1173
01:51:39,610 --> 01:51:41,202
[Yelling]

1174
01:51:46,010 --> 01:51:48,046
Shoot!

1175
01:51:49,170 --> 01:51:51,206
Magnificent valour!

1176
01:51:53,290 --> 01:51:54,848
Shoot them!

1177
01:51:56,050 --> 01:51:57,278
Fire!

1178
01:53:56,050 --> 01:53:57,881
Get off me!

1179
01:54:01,730 --> 01:54:03,129
[D'Artagnan] Phillippe!

1180
01:54:03,250 --> 01:54:05,605
Phillippe!

1181
01:54:05,690 --> 01:54:08,329
He is...your brother.

1182
01:54:09,970 --> 01:54:12,245
Brother?

1183
01:54:17,010 --> 01:54:21,083
Outside, all of you!
You are sworn to silence.

1184
01:54:23,490 --> 01:54:27,483
Get this off me!

1185
01:54:37,210 --> 01:54:39,280
Forgive me.

1186
01:54:43,130 --> 01:54:44,802
All my life...

1187
01:54:47,050 --> 01:54:51,009
this...this is the death

1188
01:54:51,090 --> 01:54:53,684
I have always wanted.

1189
01:54:57,050 --> 01:54:59,086
All for one...

1190
01:54:59,170 --> 01:55:02,560
And one fo...

1191
01:55:02,690 --> 01:55:05,727
[Aramis prays quietly]

1192
01:55:09,130 --> 01:55:12,122
YOU were the one in the mask.

1193
01:55:47,450 --> 01:55:49,441
All MY life...

1194
01:55:49,530 --> 01:55:52,681
all I ever wanted to be

1195
01:55:52,770 --> 01:55:55,079
was him.

1196
01:56:03,995 --> 01:56:05,951
We recaptured the prisoner.

1197
01:56:06,035 --> 01:56:08,469
No, I am the Ki...!

1198
01:56:10,035 --> 01:56:11,787
Put this madman

1199
01:56:11,875 --> 01:56:14,628
where no one
can hear his insanity.

1200
01:56:14,715 --> 01:56:17,627
Let him be fed by a deaf mute,

1201
01:56:17,715 --> 01:56:19,433
but feed him well.

1202
01:56:19,515 --> 01:56:21,949
Let him find redemption

1203
01:56:22,035 --> 01:56:24,754
wearing the pains
he caused others.

1204
01:56:24,835 --> 01:56:26,712
Take him!

1205
01:56:26,795 --> 01:56:28,672
I am Louis! I am Louis!

1206
01:56:32,755 --> 01:56:34,711
[Governor] And the others?

1207
01:56:41,555 --> 01:56:45,025
They are my loyal council
and truest friends.

1208
01:57:25,995 --> 01:57:30,386
In nomine patris et filii
et spiritu sancti.

1209
01:57:31,555 --> 01:57:33,307
Amen.

1210
01:57:42,435 --> 01:57:44,903
He was the best of us all.

1211
01:57:58,235 --> 01:57:59,668
[Phillippe] Athos!

1212
01:58:07,195 --> 01:58:09,948
After all you have done,

1213
01:58:10,035 --> 01:58:12,788
I must ask one more service.

1214
01:58:12,875 --> 01:58:15,992
Let me love you
like a son to a father.

1215
01:58:16,075 --> 01:58:19,431
And I pray you live for this:

1216
01:58:19,515 --> 01:58:22,666
to love me like your son.

1217
01:58:41,595 --> 01:58:44,905
Musketeers, salute!

1218
01:58:49,355 --> 01:58:52,506
One for all, all for one!

1219
01:59:03,435 --> 01:59:07,394
[Aramis] The prisoner in
the iron mask was never found.

1220
01:59:07,475 --> 01:59:11,832
It was whispered that
he received a royal pardon

1221
01:59:11,915 --> 01:59:15,032
and lived quietly
in the country,

1222
01:59:15,115 --> 01:59:18,152
visited often by the Queen.

1223
01:59:18,235 --> 01:59:20,669
The King known as Louis XIV,

1224
01:59:20,755 --> 01:59:25,146
brought his people food,
prosperity and peace.

1225
01:59:25,235 --> 01:59:28,147
He is remembered
as the greatest ruler

1226
01:59:28,235 --> 01:59:31,989
in the history of his nation.
