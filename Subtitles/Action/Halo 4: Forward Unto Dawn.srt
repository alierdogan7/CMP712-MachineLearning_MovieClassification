1
00:00:11,432 --> 00:00:12,356
[Evil Cortana]
<i>I hate you.</i>

2
00:00:12,470 --> 00:00:14,809
- [Good Cortana]<i> Cortana!</i>
- [Evil]<i> Stop it. I've made up my mind.</i>

3
00:00:14,886 --> 00:00:16,937
[Evil]
<i>Maybe if I'm going to die aboard this ship,</i>

4
00:00:16,938 --> 00:00:19,879
<i>then Chief will suffer the same fate as me.</i>

5
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:21,990
- [Good] <i>Cortana stop...</i>
- [Evil] <i>You sacrificed everything...</i>

6
00:00:21,991 --> 00:00:24,387
- <i>for him.</i>
- [Good]<i> Control yourself.</i>

7
00:00:24,388 --> 00:00:25,787
[Evil]
<i>I can't.</i>

8
00:00:26,452 --> 00:00:28,552
[Good]
<i>This isn't right. Something is...</i>

9
00:00:39,902 --> 00:00:41,601
[Good]
<i>Something set us down.</i>

10
00:00:41,602 --> 00:00:44,208
<i>Something. Interesting.</i>

11
00:00:44,407 --> 00:00:45,946
<i>I need to think.</i>

12
00:00:45,947 --> 00:00:48,047
[Evil]
<i>Thinking is what's killing you.</i>

13
00:01:12,576 --> 00:01:13,976
What happened?

14
00:01:14,161 --> 00:01:16,961
You passed out during a training exercise.

15
00:01:17,029 --> 00:01:19,129
My chest feels like it's on fire.

16
00:01:19,569 --> 00:01:22,317
Turns out the cryo blisters
and your difficulty breathing

17
00:01:22,318 --> 00:01:24,559
are an allergic reaction
to the psydoprethaline.

18
00:01:24,815 --> 00:01:26,525
It's a drug we inject
to keep ice crystals

19
00:01:26,526 --> 00:01:28,315
from forming in your
cells during cryo sleep.

20
00:01:28,459 --> 00:01:31,097
Occurs in about 1 in
every 50,000 or so.

21
00:01:31,098 --> 00:01:34,598
So I won't be able to breath
every time I wake up from cryo sleep?

22
00:01:35,705 --> 00:01:38,729
The intensity of your allergy
is still undetermined.

23
00:01:39,037 --> 00:01:41,137
I'll know more in a few hours.

24
00:01:41,477 --> 00:01:44,977
I want you to take it real easy
the rest of the day, cadet.

25
00:01:45,585 --> 00:01:46,985
Yes, sir.

26
00:01:51,330 --> 00:01:52,450
Thanks.

27
00:02:08,349 --> 00:02:09,749
Hey bro.

28
00:02:12,408 --> 00:02:15,208
I'm on Andesia, it's a jump away from home.

29
00:02:17,009 --> 00:02:18,829
It's day, uh...

30
00:02:21,604 --> 00:02:22,724
...496.

31
00:02:25,076 --> 00:02:27,176
I'm sorry I didn't com yesterday.

32
00:02:29,044 --> 00:02:32,643
Couldn't. We got pinned in a
firefight for seven hours.

33
00:02:37,409 --> 00:02:41,636
Uhh, I must've killed
a dozen Innies though.

34
00:02:43,456 --> 00:02:45,276
Mom would be proud.

35
00:02:47,776 --> 00:02:49,441
We're doing really good work here.

36
00:02:49,712 --> 00:02:51,812
We're doing a good thing.

37
00:02:57,001 --> 00:02:59,949
Rich didn't make it.
You remember Rich from back home.

38
00:03:03,531 --> 00:03:06,331
He was right there next to me and then...

39
00:03:07,746 --> 00:03:09,146
...wasn't.

40
00:03:09,254 --> 00:03:12,754
A pineapple and I'm flying
in four different directions.

41
00:03:21,657 --> 00:03:24,457
I had to shave it all off for Rich.

42
00:03:24,524 --> 00:03:26,624
He said it made me look tough.

43
00:03:28,953 --> 00:03:30,353
Anyways, uh...

44
00:03:33,066 --> 00:03:34,886
...I gotta go, bro.

45
00:03:36,002 --> 00:03:37,933
<i>I can't wait to get home.</i>

46
00:03:37,934 --> 00:03:39,754
<i>We'll see ya. Cadmon, out.</i>

47
00:03:41,852 --> 00:03:43,952
[Lasky]
What are you doing?

48
00:03:47,287 --> 00:03:50,087
Why do you torment yourself with these?

49
00:03:54,801 --> 00:03:56,201
Are you okay?

50
00:03:59,414 --> 00:04:01,514
- Whoa.
- I've been better.

51
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:03,620
Wh, what did Dr. Hughes say?

52
00:04:03,706 --> 00:04:05,526
That it's nothing.

53
00:04:05,797 --> 00:04:06,917
Really?

54
00:04:15,353 --> 00:04:17,173
You know we won today.

55
00:04:18,473 --> 00:04:20,293
Your strategy worked.

56
00:04:21,558 --> 00:04:25,516
That's just me, being a leader.

57
00:04:27,449 --> 00:04:29,651
[Sully over console]
<i>Lasky, wake up.</i>

58
00:04:29,652 --> 00:04:31,472
<i>Oh, hey, Chyler.</i>

59
00:04:31,845 --> 00:04:33,320
What's up, Sully?

60
00:04:33,321 --> 00:04:36,121
<i>Get in here, you guys gotta see this.</i>

61
00:04:40,134 --> 00:04:41,554
You look like crap.

62
00:04:41,555 --> 00:04:44,449
[Sully] Alright, so feast
your eyes on grade "A"

63
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:47,875
classified non-licit intelligence
vids I pieced together.

64
00:04:47,922 --> 00:04:50,022
Super pain in the ass to do but...

65
00:04:50,421 --> 00:04:51,821
so worth it.

66
00:04:53,343 --> 00:04:55,612
[Dimah]
This is beyond top secret.

67
00:04:55,613 --> 00:04:59,113
[Sully] I've never seen something
encrypted so hard but I cracked it.

68
00:04:59,262 --> 00:05:00,662
[Chen]
Wow.

69
00:05:00,886 --> 00:05:02,986
- [Sully] It's crazy, huh?
- [Chen] Yeah.

70
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:07,011
[Sully] Wait, wait, wait, wait
now here comes the best part.

71
00:05:07,012 --> 00:05:10,512
- [Sully] Watch his hand.
- [Spartan]<i> Target acquired.</i>

72
00:05:10,633 --> 00:05:12,733
[On video]
<i>They're coming! They're coming!</i>

73
00:05:12,819 --> 00:05:15,058
[Sully]
That thing is like two feet taller then we are.

74
00:05:15,059 --> 00:05:16,526
[Dimah]
Pretty crazy, huh?

75
00:05:16,527 --> 00:05:18,626
[Sully]
Now check this out.

76
00:05:20,386 --> 00:05:23,664
[Spartan]
<i>We've got an unknown hostile. Pulling back.</i>

77
00:05:24,261 --> 00:05:27,059
- [Vickers] Uh, no way!
- [Sully] Now who do you think they're running from?

78
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:28,775
Are they fighting together?

79
00:05:28,776 --> 00:05:31,576
[Sully]
Okay now, here comes the bast part.

80
00:05:33,142 --> 00:05:34,962
- Whoa.
- What is that thing?

81
00:05:35,378 --> 00:05:38,178
[Sully]
Now what do you think that is?

82
00:05:41,450 --> 00:05:43,565
[PA]
<i>It is now 1800.</i>

83
00:05:43,565 --> 00:05:46,795
<i>All cadets report to the mess hall.</i>

84
00:05:52,963 --> 00:05:55,763
[Sully]
<i>What do you think that thing was?</i>

85
00:05:56,219 --> 00:05:57,708
Definitely not an ODST.

86
00:05:57,709 --> 00:05:59,529
Then what could it be?

87
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:01,960
Maybe some upgraded ODST armour.

88
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:04,271
Come on, did you not see
the size of that thing?

89
00:06:04,272 --> 00:06:06,092
That's not ODST.

90
00:06:10,178 --> 00:06:11,798
Guys, look, you're missing the point.

91
00:06:11,799 --> 00:06:15,613
What matters is that our soldiers were
fighting alongside the Insurrectionists.

92
00:06:15,614 --> 00:06:17,714
Why would we protect the enemy?

93
00:06:20,325 --> 00:06:21,725
Cadet Lasky.

94
00:06:21,745 --> 00:06:24,545
Colonel Mehaffey would like to see you.

95
00:06:32,391 --> 00:06:35,191
[Mehaffey]
<i>How are you feeling?</i>

96
00:06:35,373 --> 00:06:38,549
Uh, my chest burns, sir.

97
00:06:38,692 --> 00:06:40,092
Quite a bit.

98
00:06:42,401 --> 00:06:44,221
This is for you.

99
00:06:50,885 --> 00:06:53,685
Seems like you have a choice to make, Thomas.

100
00:06:57,116 --> 00:06:58,936
I don't understand, sir.

101
00:06:59,962 --> 00:07:03,839
It appears Dr. Hughes' test has
revealed that the level of your allergy

102
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:07,500
to psydoprethaline is serious enough
to warrant a medical discharge.

103
00:07:08,085 --> 00:07:10,395
If you feel that you are unfit for service

104
00:07:10,396 --> 00:07:13,896
all you need to do is sign the
release and bring it to the tether.

105
00:07:20,416 --> 00:07:21,731
When would I leave?

106
00:07:21,732 --> 00:07:23,132
Tomorrow.

107
00:07:24,816 --> 00:07:25,667
Tomorrow?

108
00:07:25,668 --> 00:07:27,487
You know, Thomas...

109
00:07:29,172 --> 00:07:30,572
...your memories...

110
00:07:31,304 --> 00:07:34,104
...and choices are all you'll have left.

111
00:07:35,450 --> 00:07:38,950
At the end of the game the king
and the pawn go into the same box.

112
00:07:40,187 --> 00:07:43,687
You have to decide what you're
willing to sacrifice.

113
00:07:52,542 --> 00:07:53,662
Axios.

114
00:07:54,931 --> 00:07:56,051
Axios.

115
00:08:26,854 --> 00:08:28,405
[Colonel Lasky]
<i>Thomas.</i>

116
00:08:28,406 --> 00:08:31,323
<i>It is with a heavy heart that I
must inform you that today, your</i>

117
00:08:31,324 --> 00:08:34,634
<i>brother Cadmon was shot down by
Insurrectionist forces on Andesia.</i>

118
00:08:35,027 --> 00:08:36,875
<i>All of his squad perished.</i>

119
00:08:36,876 --> 00:08:39,749
<i>I've been told that it was
a quick and painless death.</i>

120
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:42,053
<i>There are no remains to bury.</i>

121
00:08:42,054 --> 00:08:46,254
<i>With this in mind I have decided that you
shall not leave Corbulo to attend services.</i>

122
00:08:46,723 --> 00:08:48,123
(Voice fades)

123
00:09:00,165 --> 00:09:01,985
[Sully]
Lasky!

124
00:09:02,456 --> 00:09:04,848
Lasky, move over I gotta
show you something.

125
00:09:04,849 --> 00:09:06,213
Now's not a good time, Sully, okay.

126
00:09:06,214 --> 00:09:08,033
No, it's important.

127
00:09:15,942 --> 00:09:18,042
Now what the hell is that?

128
00:09:20,698 --> 00:09:21,818
Hm?

129
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,463
Whoa.

130
00:09:25,568 --> 00:09:26,868
(Powers down)

131
00:09:27,391 --> 00:09:28,791
It's off line.

132
00:09:28,986 --> 00:09:31,086
I'm screwed, man.
It's ONI.

133
00:09:31,089 --> 00:09:32,909
They must have flagged those coms.

134
00:09:32,910 --> 00:09:34,730
I gotta talk to Dimah.

135
00:09:34,779 --> 00:09:36,879
Dimah! Did you tell your mom?

136
00:09:39,450 --> 00:09:40,570
Chyler?

137
00:10:00,471 --> 00:10:01,871
[Lasky]
Hey.

138
00:10:07,568 --> 00:10:09,668
I thought I'd give your spot a try.

139
00:10:11,481 --> 00:10:13,581
That com didn't make any sense.

140
00:10:14,310 --> 00:10:17,110
Hating the enemy is all I've ever known.

141
00:10:18,950 --> 00:10:21,050
Did you tell Mehaffey about it?

142
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:26,640
No.

143
00:10:28,995 --> 00:10:30,115
No.

144
00:10:34,279 --> 00:10:35,679
What's that?

145
00:10:39,023 --> 00:10:41,123
Apparently I'm allergic to war.

146
00:10:47,159 --> 00:10:48,979
What does this mean?

147
00:10:49,277 --> 00:10:51,097
You're leaving?

148
00:10:52,713 --> 00:10:54,813
Yeah, tomorrow if I sign it.

149
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:56,960
Are you going to?

150
00:10:59,673 --> 00:11:01,073
I don't know.

151
00:11:03,849 --> 00:11:06,611
- Chyler.
- Oh, it's okay.

152
00:11:07,430 --> 00:11:09,030
I know you don't want to be here.

153
00:11:09,031 --> 00:11:10,851
I just thought...

154
00:11:11,493 --> 00:11:12,613
...that maybe...

155
00:11:17,625 --> 00:11:19,025
I'll miss you.

156
00:11:37,472 --> 00:11:39,292
(Sirens start to sound)

157
00:11:42,003 --> 00:11:43,203
What is that?

158
00:11:43,217 --> 00:11:45,973
[PA]
<i>All cadets, report to the tether.</i>

159
00:11:45,974 --> 00:11:47,374
I don't know.

160
00:11:48,950 --> 00:11:51,264
To the tether!
Now!

161
00:11:51,298 --> 00:11:53,118
This is not a drill!

162
00:11:53,333 --> 00:11:56,133
Let's go, let's move,
let's move, come on!

163
00:12:05,714 --> 00:12:08,676
- Let's move it cadets!
- Go, go, move it cadets!

164
00:12:09,143 --> 00:12:10,263
Go, go, go!

165
00:12:11,916 --> 00:12:13,736
Go to your squads. Now.

166
00:12:19,786 --> 00:12:21,606
Keep moving, cadets!

167
00:12:23,252 --> 00:12:26,752
Tyler, Lasky. The rest of the squad's
already at the tether. Let's go.

168
00:12:28,702 --> 00:12:31,291
Hastati!
This way. Hurry up.

169
00:12:31,612 --> 00:12:33,409
Right here. Right here.

170
00:12:33,410 --> 00:12:35,883
Lasky, Chen, let's go.

171
00:12:37,270 --> 00:12:39,090
Okay. Hold tight. Stay in line.

172
00:12:39,501 --> 00:12:41,039
What is this? Insurrectionists?

173
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:42,860
I have no idea.

174
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:47,020
When we're assigned a number we're
going to get on to the tether, okay.

175
00:12:55,072 --> 00:12:56,472
What the...?

176
00:12:56,890 --> 00:12:58,990
Why are ODSTs dropping here?

177
00:12:59,984 --> 00:13:01,384
I don't know.

178
00:13:02,730 --> 00:13:04,830
Because we're under attack.

179
00:13:11,035 --> 00:13:12,002
This is not good.

180
00:13:12,003 --> 00:13:14,102
ODSTs dropping is never good.

181
00:13:14,971 --> 00:13:17,071
This is ridiculous.
I can get us on this wagon.

182
00:13:17,231 --> 00:13:19,875
No, no, no. We will hold our position.

183
00:13:19,876 --> 00:13:21,276
Guys, come on.

184
00:13:21,562 --> 00:13:24,362
No, Tchakova, that is a direct order.

185
00:13:24,415 --> 00:13:25,566
Suit yourself.

186
00:13:25,567 --> 00:13:26,651
- Dimah.
- No, Dimah.

187
00:13:26,652 --> 00:13:28,751
Get back in line right now.

188
00:13:32,089 --> 00:13:34,189
Return to your squad, cadet.

189
00:13:34,262 --> 00:13:35,328
I'm getting on this wagon.

190
00:13:35,329 --> 00:13:37,428
It's full. Wait for the next one.

191
00:13:37,569 --> 00:13:40,836
My mother is Secretary of Fleet-Com.

192
00:13:42,429 --> 00:13:44,249
Your choice, marine.

193
00:13:45,833 --> 00:13:46,953
Go.

194
00:13:51,422 --> 00:13:53,522
<i>Wagon full. Send her off.</i>

195
00:13:54,307 --> 00:13:56,921
This is taking too long, April.
Maybe we should bum-rush like Dimah.

196
00:13:56,922 --> 00:13:59,022
No. No, no, no, no, we'll be fine.

197
00:14:22,963 --> 00:14:25,063
What the hell are those things?

198
00:14:40,794 --> 00:14:41,914
Go!

199
00:15:34,785 --> 00:15:36,885
[Chyler]
Oh my God. What is that?

200
00:15:47,277 --> 00:15:49,097
[Chyler]
Tom, come on.

201
00:15:49,156 --> 00:15:50,919
- Come on.
- What was that?

202
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:52,320
I don't know.

203
00:15:53,754 --> 00:15:55,546
(Screams and crashing of people
falling from the tether)

204
00:15:55,547 --> 00:15:57,846
(Screams and crashing continues)
Come on, come on! Run!

205
00:16:02,510 --> 00:16:04,610
