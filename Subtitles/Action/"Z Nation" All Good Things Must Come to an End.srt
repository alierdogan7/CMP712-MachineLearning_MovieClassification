00:10:25,478 --> 00:10:27,611
Cuz we ain't coming back.

191
00:11:11,023 --> 00:11:12,823
All right. Doc, you stay with 10K.

192
00:11:12,859 --> 00:11:15,025
Vasquez and Addy, you guys cover us.

193
00:11:15,027 --> 00:11:17,194
Dearie, put your guns away.

194
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:19,113
They have a nuclear submarine.

195
00:11:19,615 --> 00:11:21,031
She has a point.

196
00:11:22,001 --> 00:11:23,334
Hey.

197
00:11:24,287 --> 00:11:25,536
You ready?

198
00:11:26,122 --> 00:11:27,538
No.

199
00:11:28,257 --> 00:11:30,374
But when did that ever matter?

200
00:11:35,214 --> 00:11:36,130
Cap'n.

201
00:11:36,549 --> 00:11:39,216
Auntie. Looks like you had a busy morning.

202
00:11:39,552 --> 00:11:41,635
We had a bit of a lunch rush.

203
00:11:42,355 --> 00:11:43,721
That's not him, is it?

204
00:11:44,106 --> 00:11:45,356
No, sir.

205
00:11:47,059 --> 00:11:49,894
Lieutenant Roberta Warren.
Missouri National Guard.

206
00:11:50,062 --> 00:11:51,562
We have the package here.

207
00:11:52,114 --> 00:11:53,063
Safe.

208
00:11:54,150 --> 00:11:56,450
So, you're The Murphy?

209
00:11:56,903 --> 00:11:58,202
Actually it's just Murphy.

210
00:11:58,237 --> 00:12:00,905
<i>I don't know where this
whole the came from.</i>

211
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:02,239
We have a wounded man.

212
00:12:02,375 --> 00:12:05,576
I'm the ship's doctor.
Let me take a look at him.

213
00:12:05,711 --> 00:12:08,128
Lot of people been looking
for you, Mr. Murphy.

214
00:12:08,164 --> 00:12:10,164
Well you found me.

215
00:12:10,883 --> 00:12:11,916
Now what?

216
00:12:12,051 --> 00:12:15,920
First we have to make sure
you are who you say you are.

217
00:12:16,005 --> 00:12:17,221
Oh.

218
00:12:18,591 --> 00:12:19,673
I am.

219
00:12:20,977 --> 00:12:22,259
<i>How do we know you are who you say you are?</i>

220
00:12:22,261 --> 00:12:24,845
I understand your
reluctance, Lieutenant Warren.

221
00:12:24,897 --> 00:12:28,349
We've been tracking
Delta-Xray-Delta for two years.

222
00:12:28,434 --> 00:12:30,567
If I'd been through
what you'd been through,

223
00:12:30,603 --> 00:12:34,188
I'd make damn sure I was giving
that package to the right person

224
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:34,939
too.

225
00:12:35,074 --> 00:12:37,775
Doctor, would you mind joining us?

226
00:12:44,367 --> 00:12:45,449
Is that him?

227
00:12:46,085 --> 00:12:47,501
I don't know.

228
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:48,919
I'm sorry.

229
00:12:49,755 --> 00:12:52,923
I only saw him for a minute
before we were evacuated.

230
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:54,291
Everything was so chaotic, there was

231
00:12:54,343 --> 00:12:56,427
Perhaps this'll jog your memory.

232
00:12:56,462 --> 00:12:57,127
Pike me.

233
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:58,595
Pike me!

234
00:12:58,631 --> 00:13:01,799
Or I will hunt you down
and eat your brains!

235
00:13:04,103 --> 00:13:04,969
That's him.

236
00:13:05,638 --> 00:13:06,470
Satisfied?

237
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:07,638
Very.

238
00:13:08,975 --> 00:13:11,275
Now let's get you back to the sub.

239
00:13:11,310 --> 00:13:13,727
We got a lot of work to do.

240
00:13:15,648 --> 00:13:17,481
What happened to your Delta Force Escort,

241
00:13:17,483 --> 00:13:18,282
Lieutenant Hammond?

242
00:13:18,367 --> 00:13:20,234
He didn't make it.

243
00:13:20,319 --> 00:13:22,786
A lot of people didn't make it.

244
00:13:23,656 --> 00:13:25,039
Easy, easy.

245
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:41,088
Hey.

246
00:13:43,059 --> 00:13:44,675
It's okay.

247
00:13:46,512 --> 00:13:47,895
I need your word

248
00:13:48,014 --> 00:13:51,982
that he will be treated
humanely. He may be The Murphy.

249
00:13:52,018 --> 00:13:53,350
But he still is a human being.

250
00:13:53,352 --> 00:13:55,102
You have my word, Lieutenant Warren.

251
00:13:55,154 --> 00:13:57,938
We'll treat him like the
celebrity he's about to become.

252
00:13:58,274 --> 00:14:01,942
[laughing] Celebrity? You hear that?

253
00:14:02,161 --> 00:14:07,197
I'm about to become the first
post-apocalyptic reality star.

254
00:14:07,333 --> 00:14:08,532
Yay me.

255
00:14:08,617 --> 00:14:10,367
Well don't forget the little people.

256
00:14:10,703 --> 00:14:13,370
It's gonna be okay, kid.
They got a real surgeon.

257
00:14:13,372 --> 00:14:14,705
They're gonna fix you up.

258
00:14:14,707 --> 00:14:16,090
I'm his physician. I'm
gonna need to go with you.

259
00:14:16,125 --> 00:14:17,591
Sorry, sir. We barely
have room for these two.

260
00:14:17,626 --> 00:14:18,842
But I, I have to be

261
00:14:18,878 --> 00:14:19,793
Don't worry.

262
00:14:19,845 --> 00:14:21,879
We'll take good care of him.

263
00:14:29,722 --> 00:14:30,854
Hey.

264
00:14:32,775 --> 00:14:35,142
Sorry about your family.

265
00:14:46,072 --> 00:14:47,488
Whoa, whoa. Hey.

266
00:14:47,573 --> 00:14:50,407
That's it? No goodbye? Nothing?

267
00:14:55,164 --> 00:14:58,382
A handshake? After all the
shit we've been through?

268
00:15:02,138 --> 00:15:04,388
Hey. I have something for you.

269
00:15:07,593 --> 00:15:10,144
I knew it. Damn it, Murphy.

270
00:15:10,479 --> 00:15:12,813
Just trying to survive, man.

271
00:15:12,932 --> 00:15:15,399
I got something for you too, brother.

272
00:15:16,519 --> 00:15:18,602
In case you get seasick.

273
00:15:20,439 --> 00:15:21,522
Thank you, brother.

274
00:15:21,607 --> 00:15:22,489
[whispering] Take care.

275
00:15:22,525 --> 00:15:23,690
We're ready, Mr. Murphy.

276
00:15:25,411 --> 00:15:26,410
<i>Psst.</i>

277
00:15:35,955 --> 00:15:37,287
Thank you.

278
00:15:38,124 --> 00:15:39,873
For everything.

279
00:15:45,848 --> 00:15:47,297
You better get going.

280
00:15:49,135 --> 00:15:50,517
Who knows?

281
00:15:51,470 --> 00:15:54,304
Maybe I'll actually enjoy doing some good.

282
00:15:55,024 --> 00:15:56,356
Count on you.

283
00:16:23,335 --> 00:16:25,002
Amen.

284
00:16:25,137 --> 00:16:26,587
No shit.

285
00:16:26,889 --> 00:16:28,839
So that's it then, huh?

286
00:16:29,175 --> 00:16:31,058
I hope the kid's gonna be okay.

287
00:16:31,093 --> 00:16:32,092
He will.

288
00:16:32,678 --> 00:16:35,179
Let's get these bodies out of here.

289
00:16:46,692 --> 00:16:49,776
At least there's no harm
done to the gene pool.

290
00:16:50,579 --> 00:16:52,029
Give you mercy.

291
00:16:52,414 --> 00:16:53,247
Hey.

292
00:16:53,282 --> 00:16:55,165
What about this poor blue son of a

[whispering] Warren.

305
00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:43,080
[whispering] Come and get some mercy.

[automatic gunfire]

308
00:17:46,993 --> 00:17:48,409
So remember,

309
00:17:48,912 --> 00:17:51,412
there is no such thing as death.

310
00:17:51,548 --> 00:17:56,050
There is only eternal life
for La Reina de la Muerta.

<i>[automatic gunfire continues]</i>

325
00:18:57,147 --> 00:18:59,731
Well my hat's off to you, Doctor Kurian.

326
00:18:59,783 --> 00:19:02,233
Once again you've proven your value.

327
00:19:02,485 --> 00:19:03,484
I must admit,

328
00:19:03,536 --> 00:19:04,986
I can't believe I'm
getting such good directions

329
00:19:05,038 --> 00:19:06,370
from a head in a box.

330
00:19:06,489 --> 00:19:09,157
My queen

331
00:19:12,495 --> 00:19:13,161
Wait.

332
00:19:19,169 --> 00:19:20,835
Where are you, little kitty?

333
00:19:22,338 --> 00:19:23,888
Oooh.

334
00:19:24,007 --> 00:19:26,507
There you are, pretty pretty.

335
00:19:28,511 --> 00:19:31,846
Violence at such a range is so impersonal.

336
00:19:31,981 --> 00:19:33,848
Where's the dignity?

337
00:19:34,017 --> 00:19:35,683
Ammo? Who's got what?

338
00:19:35,735 --> 00:19:36,400
I'm good.

339
00:19:36,436 --> 00:19:36,901
Doc?

340
00:19:38,104 --> 00:19:40,738
Well I'm okay, but I left my
bag out there. I don't know

341
00:19:40,774 --> 00:19:43,608
how far Im gonna be able
to chuck the damn crowbar.

342
00:19:43,660 --> 00:19:44,442
I'm out.

343
00:19:45,528 --> 00:19:47,745
And without range, this
cover won't do us much good.

344
00:19:48,081 --> 00:19:50,248
Well if you just ask nicely

345
00:19:52,452 --> 00:19:54,418
Well aren't you full of surprises.

346
00:19:54,454 --> 00:19:56,871
Well I'm a little low on ammo.

347
00:19:57,006 --> 00:20:00,374
But I think we can give
them hell in the meantime.

348
00:20:02,428 --> 00:20:05,346
All right. Let's rock and roll.

349
00:20:06,216 --> 00:20:09,267
The fact that they haven't
started beating down these doors

350
00:20:09,302 --> 00:20:12,637
yet worries me more than
if they just kept attacking.

351
00:20:12,722 --> 00:20:15,857
Mindless mayhem we can handle.

352
00:20:16,142 --> 00:20:18,226
Whatever the hell they're planning,

353
00:20:18,778 --> 00:20:20,561
I'm not so sure.

354
00:20:39,249 --> 00:20:42,466
Young male. Single large caliber
gunshot wound to the abdomen.

355
00:20:42,502 --> 00:20:45,887
Pulse weak, irregular.
He's lost a lot of blood.

356
00:20:48,341 --> 00:20:49,974
Is he gonna be okay?

357
00:20:50,009 --> 00:20:52,393
They'll do everything they
can. Now we need to leave.

358
00:20:52,428 --> 00:20:54,979
We'll make sure to get him back
to his friends in one piece.

359
00:20:55,014 --> 00:20:56,230
Your man's in good hands.

360
00:20:56,266 --> 00:20:59,150
He's not my man. He's just
a byproduct of the apocalypse

361
00:20:59,185 --> 00:21:00,735
I couldn't seem to shake.

362
00:21:00,770 --> 00:21:01,819
Follow me.

363
00:21:05,408 --> 00:21:07,491
<i>We've been waiting for you
a long time, Mr. Murphy.</i>

364
00:21:07,610 --> 00:21:10,077
Yeah, well I got a little sidetracked.

365
00:21:10,163 --> 00:21:12,163
Have there been any side
effects from the vaccine?

366
00:21:12,198 --> 00:21:15,666
Side effects? Lady, I am a
giant walking side effect.

367
00:21:15,952 --> 00:21:17,168
Any cravings?

368
00:21:17,287 --> 00:21:18,703
You mean for brains?

369
00:21:19,255 --> 00:21:20,121
No.

370
00:21:25,762 --> 00:21:27,461
Who are you working for?

371
00:21:27,797 --> 00:21:30,131
I thought the U.S. Government
collapsed years ago.

372
00:21:30,266 --> 00:21:31,132
It did.

373
00:21:32,268 --> 00:21:34,435
The whole idea of a nation
state is a thing of the past.

374
00:21:34,604 --> 00:21:37,855
A new world is rising
from the ashes of the old.

375
00:21:37,974 --> 00:21:39,473
A better world.

376
00:21:39,559 --> 00:21:40,808
Zona.

377
00:21:41,444 --> 00:21:42,526
Zona?

378
00:21:43,029 --> 00:21:44,562
I've heard of that.

379
00:21:44,948 --> 00:21:48,316
This crazy pilot in Roswell.
He was gonna fly some

380
00:21:48,318 --> 00:21:50,067
experimental aircraft back to Zona.

381
00:21:50,119 --> 00:21:51,719
We thought he was nuts.

382
00:21:51,771 --> 00:21:52,637
Zona's real?

383
00:21:52,689 --> 00:21:56,224
Zona is more than just
real. It's the future.

384
00:21:56,609 --> 00:22:00,311
Early in the apocalypse, a
group of visionary world leaders

385
00:22:00,363 --> 00:22:04,065
and businessmen embarked
on a plan to save humanity.

386
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:06,817
Together they created a zombie free island

387
00:22:06,819 --> 00:22:10,037
where the seeds of the next
human race have been planted.

388
00:22:10,406 --> 00:22:12,707
What about the old human race?

389
00:22:12,742 --> 00:22:14,325
Time may be running out.

390
00:22:14,327 --> 00:22:17,378
The pilot you met was part of a larger plan

391
00:22:17,413 --> 00:22:20,047
to recover advanced technology
and cultural heritage

392
00:22:20,083 --> 00:22:21,499
before it's lost forever.

393
00:22:21,834 --> 00:22:24,835
Unfortunately, both
tend to be very fragile.

394
00:22:24,971 --> 00:22:29,140
We're in a race against time to
hold onto what makes us human.

395
00:22:29,342 --> 00:22:30,508
[clank]

396
00:22:38,234 --> 00:22:39,183
Sorry.

397
00:22:39,269 --> 00:22:40,151
My bad.

398
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:44,105
So if we are going to save the human race,

399
00:22:44,190 --> 00:22:45,740
maybe we better get started.

400
00:22:48,361 --> 00:22:50,861
Anybody tries to come in that front door

401
00:22:50,863 --> 00:22:53,781
is stepping right into our kill box.

402
00:22:53,866 --> 00:22:55,783
<i>Cubrirse! Cubrirse!</i>

403
00:22:57,670 --> 00:22:59,920
Now what are they up to?

404
00:23:06,379 --> 00:23:07,928
Hey, Roberta!

405
00:23:07,964 --> 00:23:09,096
Hey!

406
00:23:09,382 --> 00:23:12,717
It's not you I came
after. Just Murphy. Hmmm?

407
00:23:13,186 --> 00:23:15,436
I only want Murphy!

408
00:23:15,555 --> 00:23:19,473
You give him to me, and
we can still be friends.

409
00:23:19,559 --> 00:23:22,893
Too late, Chica! He's gone!

410
00:23:26,566 --> 00:23:30,318

412
00:23:35,658 --> 00:23:37,375
Shit. Missed.

413
00:23:40,580 --> 00:23:41,212
Ready.

414
00:23:41,297 --> 00:23:42,713
(all) Apunten!

415
00:23:43,249 --> 00:23:44,582
Machetes!

416
00:23:50,306 --> 00:23:51,055

Perfect. Just like when I was a kid.

438
00:25:09,668 --> 00:25:13,253
I'm gonna need a few samples
of your blood to run some tests.

439
00:25:13,622 --> 00:25:14,671
I'm all yours.

440
00:25:17,876 --> 00:25:19,709
This should be interesting.

442
00:25:24,216 --> 00:25:25,098
Their eyes?

443
00:25:26,101 --> 00:25:28,351
It's a side effect from
one of the early vaccines

444
00:25:28,387 --> 00:25:29,603
given to everyone on Zona.

445
00:25:29,638 --> 00:25:30,687
But not you?

446
00:25:30,722 --> 00:25:31,888
I've never been.

447
00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:34,057
I've only seen the inside of this sub

448
00:25:34,109 --> 00:25:35,642
since we evacuated Mt. Wilson.

449
00:25:35,694 --> 00:25:38,278
How do you even know Zona's real then?

450
00:25:38,313 --> 00:25:40,897
I worked for some of the
people who first founded Zona

451
00:25:40,949 --> 00:25:41,865
before the outbreak.

452
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:43,366
They're the only ones left

453
00:25:43,402 --> 00:25:46,369
with enough power and
resources to stop this plague.

454
00:25:46,405 --> 00:25:47,571
We almost had it.

455
00:25:48,073 --> 00:25:50,624
But the vaccine only slows down the virus.

456
00:25:50,659 --> 00:25:53,126
It doesn't kill it or make you immune.

457
00:25:53,161 --> 00:25:55,245
Some of the earliest people vaccinated

458
00:25:55,297 --> 00:25:58,081
are losing their immunity
and starting to turn.

459
00:25:58,083 --> 00:25:59,549
Including the founder of Zona.

460
00:26:01,253 --> 00:26:02,836
That's why we need you.

461
00:26:03,922 --> 00:26:06,640
I thought the vaccine
was for all of humanity?

462
00:26:06,675 --> 00:26:07,591
It will be.

463
00:26:10,729 --> 00:26:13,096
Have you had any major childhood diseases?

464
00:26:13,148 --> 00:26:15,015
Measles, mumps, chickenpox.

465
00:26:15,434 --> 00:26:17,984
Yes, yes, and I think yes.

466
00:26:18,103 --> 00:26:21,321
I was sick all the time when
I was a kid. I had everything.

467
00:26:21,356 --> 00:26:24,774
Mono, whooping cough,
poison ivy, you name it.

468
00:26:24,826 --> 00:26:26,776
Any sexually transmitted diseases?

469
00:26:33,785 --> 00:26:34,534
The usual.

470
00:26:35,754 --> 00:26:38,288
You don't have to go into detail
The tests will tell me more.

471
00:26:38,423 --> 00:26:39,422
Any children?

472
00:26:42,044 --> 00:26:44,344
These are awfully personal questions.

473
00:26:46,598 --> 00:26:47,631
You mind?

474
00:26:49,134 --> 00:26:50,934
A little privacy?

475
00:26:53,772 --> 00:26:54,688
Would you mind?

476
00:26:54,723 --> 00:26:56,389
We'll only be a minute.

I thought you might be
different than Doctor Kurian.

479
00:27:09,988 --> 00:27:10,987
But I was wrong.

480
00:27:11,123 --> 00:27:12,789
You met Doctor Kurian?

481
00:27:12,824 --> 00:27:15,825
Oh we're old buddies, he and I.

482
00:27:16,161 --> 00:27:18,161
I know all about you two.

483
00:27:18,497 --> 00:27:20,130

00:27:20,465 --> 00:27:21,381

[breathing heavily]

561
00:31:30,165 --> 00:31:32,165
We could've been

562
00:31:33,051 --> 00:31:34,334
such good friends.

563
00:31:40,225 --> 00:31:40,723

564
00:31:40,809 --> 00:31:41,925

566
00:31:51,403 --> 00:31:52,318
Escorpion?

567
00:31:53,488 --> 00:31:54,771
No, mi reina.

568
00:31:55,273 --> 00:31:56,406
Soy Hector.

569
00:32:05,166 --> 00:32:07,784
Te doy misericordia.

570
00:32:54,230 --> 00:32:55,229
Thank you.

571
00:32:55,515 --> 00:32:56,397
De nada.

572
00:32:57,149 --> 00:32:57,681
Wait! [smack]

573
00:32:58,518 --> 00:33:00,017
Never leave a zombie to do a man's job.

574
00:33:00,019 --> 00:33:01,268
He saved my life.

575
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:02,603
I don't care.

576
00:33:02,905 --> 00:33:05,322
Well ding dong. The bitch is dead.

577
00:33:06,859 --> 00:33:08,158
<i>You killed your queen?</i>

578
00:33:09,078 --> 00:33:09,827
Why?

579
00:33:10,863 --> 00:33:12,530
She wasn't my queen.

580
00:33:16,452 --> 00:33:18,953
Not since she got that cooked
batch of Kurian's vaccine.

581
00:33:19,338 --> 00:33:22,256
I followed them here through
all their death and destruction.

582
00:33:22,708 --> 00:33:25,009
She wasn't human anymore.

583
00:33:25,211 --> 00:33:27,044
None of them were.

584
00:33:30,466 --> 00:33:33,183
I won't rob you of your revenge.

585
00:33:33,269 --> 00:33:34,552
You've earned it.

586
00:33:35,221 --> 00:33:38,222
Escorpion deserves to
die for what he did to

587
00:33:41,611 --> 00:33:43,477
What I did to your family.

588
00:33:43,813 --> 00:33:46,814
If you want to kill me, you go right ahead.

589
00:33:46,866 --> 00:33:49,783
I've been a one man apocalypse all my life.

590
00:33:49,902 --> 00:33:51,485
I'm not afraid to die.

591
00:33:51,571 --> 00:33:54,872
Death, shit, that's all I know.

592
00:33:56,075 --> 00:33:58,292
I know it don't mean shit,

593
00:33:58,327 --> 00:34:00,744
but I apologize.

594
00:34:01,914 --> 00:34:05,015
I'm not that man who
killed your family, man.

595
00:34:07,553 --> 00:34:09,503
That man is dead.

596
00:34:10,056 --> 00:34:13,307
Killed by the Zs when you
threw me down that hole.

597
00:34:13,476 --> 00:34:14,975
In that one second,

598
00:34:15,094 --> 00:34:17,561
I saw every horrible and
malicious thing I ever did.

599
00:34:17,597 --> 00:34:19,813
And I wanted to die right there and then.

600
00:34:19,849 --> 00:34:22,733
But I knew if my life
were to have any meaning,

601
00:34:22,768 --> 00:34:25,019
I had to get out of there.

602
00:34:25,354 --> 00:34:30,074
I had to survive and make up
for all the things that I did.

603
00:34:30,826 --> 00:34:33,110
Maybe this is how I do it.

604
00:34:34,697 --> 00:34:36,580
Do me a favor, man.

605
00:34:39,619 --> 00:34:41,335
You pull that trigger.

606
00:34:49,962 --> 00:34:51,462
Do what you have to.

607
00:34:53,966 --> 00:34:57,885
But who are you gonna be
after you pull that trigger?

608
00:35:16,706 --> 00:35:17,955
[gunshot]

609
00:35:22,628 --> 00:35:23,827
What happened?

610
00:35:42,098 --> 00:35:43,564
I couldn't do it.

611
00:35:43,599 --> 00:35:45,065
I know.

612
00:35:46,102 --> 00:35:47,568
I'm glad.

613
00:35:47,853 --> 00:35:49,353
Not for him.

614
00:35:49,572 --> 00:35:50,437
For you.

615
00:35:53,492 --> 00:35:55,826
Never did show you this did I?

616
00:35:55,995 --> 00:35:56,410
No.

617
00:36:01,751 --> 00:36:03,117
She's beautiful.

618
00:36:04,503 --> 00:36:05,703
They both are.

619
00:36:07,673 --> 00:36:10,007
Come on. We better get going.

620
00:36:11,177 --> 00:36:13,043
My mission is over.

621
00:36:14,964 --> 00:36:17,715
Yeah. So is mine.

622
00:36:20,686 --> 00:36:21,885
You better go.

623
00:36:23,773 --> 00:36:26,106
Well I ain't gonna say goodbye.

624
00:36:27,193 --> 00:36:28,442
Me neither.

625
00:36:30,863 --> 00:36:31,895
Well.

626
00:36:34,483 --> 00:36:37,568
Watch out for those
puppies and kittens, huh?

627
00:36:44,410 --> 00:36:45,626
I will.

628
00:37:00,142 --> 00:37:01,008
What happened?

629
00:37:01,093 --> 00:37:02,092
Is he alive?

630
00:37:02,595 --> 00:37:03,260
He's alive.

631
00:37:05,931 --> 00:37:07,264
He's not coming.

632
00:37:07,349 --> 00:37:09,183
Well, what do we do now, Chief?

633
00:37:09,235 --> 00:37:10,484
I don't know.

634
00:37:10,603 --> 00:37:13,187
I'm not in charge anymore.

I got enough food, ammo,

640
00:38:09,628 --> 00:38:10,377
I'm in.

641
00:38:13,048 --> 00:38:13,964
Well look.

642
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,551
If we need to, we kill
him and we take the truck.

643
00:38:25,010 --> 00:38:27,477
We're only going as far as the beach.

644
00:38:27,563 --> 00:38:29,313
I like the beach.

Big sub like that, they got
to have a real medical team.

Well I hope they don't bleed him dry.

I hate to admit it,

653
00:39:47,241 --> 00:39:49,124
but I kinda miss Murphy.

654
00:39:49,209 --> 00:39:49,791
Really?

655
00:39:50,544 --> 00:39:51,877
I didn't get to know him too well,

656
00:39:51,912 --> 00:39:53,996

00:40:02,056 --> 00:40:03,755
That doesn't look good.

658
00:40:03,841 --> 00:40:05,173
Is it submerging?

659
00:40:08,429 --> 00:40:09,344
No.

660
00:40:09,813 --> 00:40:11,346
It's sinking.

00:40:11,515 --> 00:40:12,848

Is that a boat?

664
00:40:21,659 --> 00:40:26,161
It's Murphy. He has Doctor
Merch and the Sub Captain.

665
00:40:26,530 --> 00:40:28,113
