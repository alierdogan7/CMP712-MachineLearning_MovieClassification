00:01:32,008 --> 00:01:39,828
Philipine authorities now say the toll in yesterday's
hotel bombing has risen to 146 dead and 231 wounded

7
00:01:39,898 --> 00:01:46,128
It is the most devastating terrorist attack in Asia,
in 10 years. And the worst ever, in Manila.

8
00:01:46,188 --> 00:01:49,568
While no organization has taken
responsibility for the blast,

9
00:01:49,628 --> 00:01:52,478
Western intelligence sources have identified

10
00:01:52,528 --> 00:01:58,448
chemical traces that are the hallmark of
the infamous arms-dealer, Aarmir Barkawi

11
00:01:59,848 --> 00:02:06,608
International security experts say that the Barkawi
family is now instigating violence in remote capitals

12
00:02:06,658 --> 00:02:13,128
To foster instability, and thus fuel
massive arms sales around the globe.

14
00:02:52,328 --> 00:02:54,808
Did Philippine Intelligence track you?

Father,

16
00:03:08,708 --> 00:03:11,098
- You did well,
- Thank you.

We need to discuss Major General Rahmad.

It's your sister's wedding.

00:03:17,248 --> 00:03:19,308
I'm sorry, this can't wait.

20
00:03:22,568 --> 00:03:25,338
I think your ISI officer was compromised.

21
00:03:25,458 --> 00:03:30,548
Kamran, all Pakistani intelligence
officers are compromised.

22
00:03:30,718 --> 00:03:34,818
One of our Afghani friends discovered
a German BND agent in his circle.

23
00:03:34,868 --> 00:03:35,568
And?

24
00:03:40,718 --> 00:03:45,228
That particular general won't be very
useful to us anymore. He's been eliminated.

25
00:03:48,548 --> 00:03:50,508
Thought you might want to know.

26
00:03:50,568 --> 00:03:51,848
Don't forget his family.

27
00:03:53,498 --> 00:03:58,098
Vengeance must always be profound,
and absolute.

28
00:04:05,258 --> 00:04:06,208
Very happy.

Pick a name yet?

37
00:06:25,368 --> 00:06:27,918
Well, we were thinking Benjamin

- Hell, no!!

If it's a girl, maybe.

00:06:40,248 --> 00:06:41,318
Voight,

41
00:06:43,068 --> 00:06:47,358
- Voight, you want to run over him for me?
- Believe me, sir. We've tried.

Alright, so six cameras, right?

47
00:07:19,228 --> 00:07:24,508
One, two, three, four, five, six.

48
00:07:24,558 --> 00:07:26,698
- Why is that too much?
- Yeah, maybe.

49
00:07:26,728 --> 00:07:28,658
Yeah, it's too much.
and I thought that.

50
00:07:29,058 --> 00:07:30,698
They're baby gifts from the guys.

51
00:07:32,338 --> 00:07:34,678
- I'll take them down.
- All we need ..

52
00:07:35,258 --> 00:07:38,798
- Is one baby monitor.
- One baby monitor, right.

53
00:07:39,138 --> 00:07:39,818
Okay,

54
00:07:40,338 --> 00:07:43,298

He is believed to have
suffered a heart attack.

85
00:10:16,748 --> 00:10:20,008
Possibly, from complications
after the surgical procedure

86
00:10:20,068 --> 00:10:22,008
to repair his knee a day earlier.

87
00:10:22,288 --> 00:10:25,168

within the next 48 hours.

Yes, it's a logistical nightmare.

But let's make sure this runs
without a hitch.

104
00:11:29,698 --> 00:11:30,578
Questions?

105
00:11:31,388 --> 00:11:35,128
And what special requests did
the [ ?? ] circus demand so far?

106
00:11:35,358 --> 00:11:37,918
Dallas Cowboys cheerleaders,
part of the [ ?? ] possibly?

That's a request I can get with [ ?? ]

I'm partial to the Kardashians, myself.
As apparently is Her Majesty.

109
00:11:46,718 --> 00:11:49,408
19 special requests from
12 different countries.

110
00:11:49,508 --> 00:11:51,488
We denied all of them.

111
00:11:52,628 --> 00:11:55,918
Any issues or special concern
with our current assessment?

112
00:11:56,268 --> 00:11:59,178
We all know about he 350 or
so British nationals who

113
00:11:59,238 --> 00:12:01,368
have traveled back and forth
to Syria in the past year,

114
00:12:02,088 --> 00:12:05,128
As we've seen before in Iraq,
and Afghanistan.

115
00:12:06,128 --> 00:12:10,148
Of rising concern is the handful
we believe to be former military.

116
00:12:10,208 --> 00:12:12,218
- Is any of this actionable?
- No.

00:12:13,358 --> 00:12:14,408
Very well ..

118
00:12:15,268 --> 00:12:17,498

119
00:12:17,798 --> 00:12:19,128
with dignity.

120
00:12:20,318 --> 00:12:22,078

Sir,

122
00:12:29,868 --> 00:12:31,858
- Are you ready for us?
- Yeah, come on in.

123
00:12:33,028 --> 00:12:34,288
Take a seat.

The Brits are world-class.
We all know their reputation.

127
00:12:47,438 --> 00:12:48,458
But still,

128
00:12:48,548 --> 00:12:50,198
These are the trips I hate.

129
00:12:50,248 --> 00:12:53,198
Last minute, out of the country,
no time to plan.

130
00:12:53,588 --> 00:12:55,968
Are you sure I can't talk you out of this?

131
00:12:56,698 --> 00:12:58,088
Lynn, it's a state funeral.

132
00:12:59,158 --> 00:13:00,708
They're our oldest, strongest ally.

133
00:13:01,008 --> 00:13:03,928
Alright.  I spent half the night
on the line with our advance team.

134
00:13:04,588 --> 00:13:07,048
Metropolitan Police will secure the parameter

135
00:13:07,148 --> 00:13:08,868
of the funeral around St. Paul's Cathedral.

136
00:13:08,928 --> 00:13:11,258
Air Force One will land at
Stansted Airport (London)

137
00:13:11,378 --> 00:13:13,328
On the ground, it's all Mike.

138
00:13:13,518 --> 00:13:17,858
Touch down. Then a 12-minute chopper
ride to Somerset House.

139
00:13:18,458 --> 00:13:20,788
From there we take an armoured vehicle escort

140
00:13:20,858 --> 00:13:24,078
down Sweet Street .. to the Cathedral

141
00:13:26,028 --> 00:13:27,408
You don't seem thrilled.

142
00:13:27,738 --> 00:13:29,498
The British have their hands full.

143
00:13:29,788 --> 00:13:32,648
It's a cluster-fuck .. sir.

144
00:13:33,248 --> 00:13:34,218
Well,

145
00:13:34,648 --> 00:13:38,148
Forty different countries,
with 40 different security teams.

146
00:13:38,468 --> 00:13:42,588
Minimal flexibility on approach routes.
funeral seating, egress.

147
00:13:44,308 --> 00:13:46,358
- Can we make it work?
- Mike?

148
00:13:47,688 --> 00:13:48,778
I always do, sir.

149
00:13:50,498 --> 00:13:51,458
Good.

150
00:13:52,128 --> 00:13:53,918
I know it's not great timing for you, but ..

151
00:13:55,548 --> 00:13:56,628
It's what I do.

152
00:13:57,368 --> 00:13:58,298
Thank you sir.

153
00:14:13,718 --> 00:14:16,118
- There's my man.
- Mr. Vice-President,

154
00:14:16,918 --> 00:14:19,008
- How was your vacation, sir?
- Son,

155
00:14:19,698 --> 00:14:23,058
Do you have any idea, the joy a man feels

156
00:14:23,148 --> 00:14:26,848
pulling a 70-lb king macarel out of the
waters around Jekyll Island?

157
00:14:27,038 --> 00:14:29,328
- No, sir, I don't.
- That makes two of us.

158
00:14:30,018 --> 00:14:34,418
And I'll have to wait till next year to find out.
But, thanks for asking.

159
00:14:47,668 --> 00:14:50,048
- It's beautiful.
- There you go.

160
00:14:50,678 --> 00:14:52,718
- It's pretty.
- I love these things.

161
00:14:57,008 --> 00:14:59,438
Don't worry about a thing, we'll be fine.

162
00:15:02,088 --> 00:15:04,728
- Doris, can we have a minute?
- Sure.

163
00:15:07,398 --> 00:15:09,938
- Oh you meant Leah? right.
- Very funny, Doris.

164
00:15:12,808 --> 00:15:14,608
She tells me not to worry.

165
00:15:16,378 --> 00:15:17,858
It's only three days.

166
00:15:18,688 --> 00:15:21,198
- Yeah,
- And I'm not due for two weeks.

167
00:15:23,358 --> 00:15:27,168
- Walking away, it's not so easy this time.

168
00:15:27,628 --> 00:15:30,698
Hey, I got this.

169
00:15:31,338 --> 00:15:36,508
You go and you do what you have to do, and

Your idea of nesting being, bullet-proofing

Now, that is actually a great idea.

Yes,

182
00:16:51,038 --> 00:16:52,328

00:39:55,308 --> 00:39:59,288
This is the day,
when your world changes forever.

340
00:40:01,618 --> 00:40:06,408
- Jesus. -- This is all over social media too.
Everybody in the world has seen this.

341
00:40:07,028 --> 00:40:09,528
Aamir Bakawi.

342
00:40:09,708 --> 00:40:11,338
Number six on the 10 list.

343
00:40:11,538 --> 00:40:14,478
This man is responsible for
more deaths than the Plague.

344
00:40:14,808 --> 00:40:17,318
Sells arms to every failed state in the world.

345
00:40:17,558 --> 00:40:22,178
Has a vast array of connections,
terrorists, mercenaries, corporations,

346
00:40:23,798 --> 00:40:30,158
- Mr. Vice-President, it's Barkawi.
- Put him through.

347
00:40:34,678 --> 00:40:39,158
Thought you might take my call.
You understand if I make it difficult to track.

348
00:40:39,358 --> 00:40:41,158
You have me at somewhat of a loss.

349
00:40:42,128 --> 00:40:46,088
I thought you would've learned a lesson
by now, about crawling out of your hole.

350
00:40:46,468 --> 00:40:51,518
- I've never lifted a finger against you.
- You arm those who have.

351
00:40:52,678 --> 00:40:57,318
I sold triggers, Mr. Trumbull.
Just like you.

352
00:40:58,548 --> 00:40:59,528
What do you want?

353
00:41:00,178 --> 00:41:01,078
Your President.

354
00:41:02,768 --> 00:41:04,918
You can end this right now.

355
00:41:06,808 --> 00:41:10,098
- Just hand him over.
- That's not going to happen.

356
00:41:10,908 --> 00:41:14,298
Then every death from this moment
forward, will be on your head.

357
00:41:27,608 --> 00:41:33,348
Barkawi, sells arms to dummy companies.
Some of them probably in London.

358
00:41:34,068 --> 00:41:35,358
Find a connection to him.

359
00:41:35,728 --> 00:41:40,308
He's probably been planning this for
years. Everybody makes a mistake.

360
00:41:40,548 --> 00:41:43,038
We have to find him before
he finds the President.

361
00:41:44,658 --> 00:41:45,748
Let's get to it.

362
00:42:05,018 --> 00:42:06,878
- Mike is a bully?
- Yeah.

363
00:42:08,408 --> 00:42:10,238
Not exactly standard police issue.

364
00:42:13,768 --> 00:42:14,738
Really?

365
00:42:16,878 --> 00:42:17,638
Oh, my god.

366
00:42:20,918 --> 00:42:24,198
- I've never seen a man suffocate before.
- I didn't have a knife.

367
00:42:24,888 --> 00:42:27,978
Got  more ammunition than
the entire US Army.

368
00:42:28,588 --> 00:42:32,028
How can they pull something like this off.
Gots to be somebody on the inside.

369
00:42:32,128 --> 00:42:34,288
Yeah, looks like it.

370
00:42:34,458 --> 00:42:38,028
These aren't you typical hill-trained
hillbillies. These guys are pros.

371
00:42:38,088 --> 00:42:41,378
- We should go for the Embassy.
- They'll be expecting that.

372
00:42:43,018 --> 00:42:46,118
There's a MI-6 safehouse near here.
I have a contact there.

373
00:42:46,348 --> 00:42:50,798
We go there, we get geared up, and get an extraction.
- Do you trust them? -- Yeah.

374
00:42:51,138 --> 00:42:55,798
The fact is, every single one of these guys
is a terrorist asshole. Until proven otherwise.

375
00:42:56,348 --> 00:42:59,608
The only person you trust right now,
is me, okay?

376
00:43:00,328 --> 00:43:01,958
Come on, let's go.

377
00:43:04,018 --> 00:43:08,368
- Gotta get underground.
- These guys are everywhere.

378
00:43:27,278 --> 00:43:28,228
Let's go.

379
00:43:36,688 --> 00:43:38,728
Stay here. I'll be back.

380
00:44:36,658 --> 00:44:37,938
Raza ..

381
00:44:42,038 --> 00:44:42,968
Raza

382
00:44:47,458 --> 00:44:48,358
Here ..

383
00:44:53,398 --> 00:44:56,168
We can do easy, or the hard way.

384
00:44:57,288 --> 00:44:59,508
Raza. Answer me, brother.

385
00:45:04,538 --> 00:45:07,988
Raza's not feeling too well at the moment.
He's a little bit fucked up.

386
00:45:08,488 --> 00:45:10,988
Hey, you. What's this dick guy's name?

387
00:45:14,658 --> 00:45:18,438
- This is Kamra. Who is this?
- Hey, Cameron. [sic]

388
00:45:19,098 --> 00:45:22,478
- My name is Mike Banning.
- You are the one with the President.

389
00:45:22,958 --> 00:45:28,318
Bingo. So why don't you boys pack up your shit and head
back to Fuckeninstan or wherever it is you're from.

390
00:45:29,418 --> 00:45:35,148
You should've let us kill him quickly.
Because now, we're going to kill him slowly.

391
00:45:35,868 --> 00:45:39,558
And stream it live. For the whole world to see.

392
00:45:40,548 --> 00:45:42,188
Can you hear me, Mr. President?

393
00:45:43,868 --> 00:45:46,428
- Tell him,
- Yeah, he can hear you.

394
00:45:46,518 --> 00:45:48,488
And here's something I want you hear first.

395
00:45:59,608 --> 00:46:02,828
That's the sound of your brother dying. Yeah.

396
00:46:03,158 --> 00:46:07,438
Not much of a talker, that one.
But I bet one of your men will.

397
00:46:08,378 --> 00:46:10,418
I'll see you soon, Cameron [sic]

398
00:46:14,228 --> 00:46:16,538
- Was that really necessary?
- No.

399
00:46:25,508 --> 00:46:27,228
The Brits are compromised.

400
00:46:27,788 --> 00:46:31,618
The police for sure.
Who do you trust?

401
00:46:31,688 --> 00:46:34,678
We can also assume all communications
are compromised.

402
00:46:34,778 --> 00:46:37,938
Anything that isn't secured,
could get into the wrong hands, sir.

403
00:46:38,098 --> 00:46:41,288
- And Banning would know that too.
- So how could he even reach out for help?

404
00:46:42,578 --> 00:46:45,128
There, freeze that. Sir,

405
00:46:46,908 --> 00:46:49,338
- Is Banning left-handed?
- No, right-handed.

406
00:46:50,208 --> 00:46:53,458
Okay, well, the President doesn't move
without a drone or satellite over his head.

407
00:46:53,968 --> 00:46:56,828
- Banning knows that.
- That's his left hand.

408
00:46:57,128 --> 00:47:00,458
- Southpaw .. six.
- Shorthand for MI-6.

409
00:47:01,878 --> 00:47:04,778
Look for any MI-6 location in that are.

410
00:47:05,258 --> 00:47:06,968
- Yes, sir.
- Alright, Banning.

411
00:47:19,518 --> 00:47:22,088
- You okay?
- Yeah.

412
00:47:22,688 --> 00:47:25,228
- [ ?? ] , bad choice.
- Hah,

413
00:47:26,298 --> 00:47:28,208
Sit down, take deep breaths.

414
00:47:35,088 --> 00:47:36,188
How many you think died?

415
00:47:37,968 --> 00:47:40,458
I don't know .. A lot.

416
00:47:41,168 --> 00:47:46,138
All those innocent people.
Dead ... Because of me.

417
00:47:46,308 --> 00:47:48,268
No. Not because of you. Because of them.

418
00:47:48,898 --> 00:47:50,298
They tried to kill you, sir.

419
00:47:50,828 --> 00:47:54,958
And they killed all these people, just
to make everyone else more afraid.

420
00:47:55,008 --> 00:47:56,878
Well, fuck that.
Fuck them.

421
00:47:57,418 --> 00:48:01,558
Mike ..
You don't let them take me.

422
00:48:01,858 --> 00:48:03,728
- I'm not going to.
- You need to do it.

423
00:48:04,888 --> 00:48:07,108
If it comes to it.  If it's going south.

424
00:48:10,378 --> 00:48:12,138
If it comes to it, I want you to kill me.

425
00:48:15,458 --> 00:48:16,488
That' an order.

426
00:48:18,018 --> 00:48:20,218
I will not be prosecuted for propaganda.

427
00:48:20,258 --> 00:48:24,138
As my son and the American people see me on
fucken YouTube for the rest of their lives.

428
00:48:30,198 --> 00:48:30,828
.. Okay.

429
00:48:36,968 --> 00:48:40,738
- Vice President Trumbull is among us, sir.
- Inspector.

430
00:48:41,028 --> 00:48:43,168
I'm afraid our .. news isn't promising.

431
00:48:43,328 --> 00:48:46,358
Our dearly departed Prime Minister
James Wilson was assassinated.

432
00:48:47,588 --> 00:48:51,568
Poison in his anesthesia, and his doctor's
body found dumped about an hour ago.

433
00:48:51,798 --> 00:48:52,768
State funeral ..

434
00:48:53,698 --> 00:48:57,338
Must-attend event for western leaders.
Each one a target.

435
00:48:57,568 --> 00:49:00,388
Goddamn.
And we walked right into it.

436
00:49:00,518 --> 00:49:03,248
And all dead. By your men and ours.

437
00:49:03,298 --> 00:49:04,688
What's happening on the ground?

438
00:49:04,808 --> 00:49:10,578
The terrorists have killed 19 first-
responders. We've another 30 unaccounted for.

439
00:49:10,878 --> 00:49:14,888
They're impersonating us. Our people
are walking right into ambushes.

440
00:49:14,938 --> 00:49:16,168
Say the word and we go in.

441
00:49:16,648 --> 00:49:20,778
But make no mistake.  We risk turning
London into another Fallujah.

442
00:49:21,448 --> 00:49:25,128
That's the last thing we need.
The President in the middle of an urban battle.

443
00:49:25,338 --> 00:49:26,888
Or the citizens of London.

444
00:49:26,968 --> 00:49:29,768
Or you're just as likely to take out
half the Metropolitan Police Force,

445
00:49:29,808 --> 00:49:33,258
Unless you can tell me how you can tell the
difference between the good guys and the bad guys.

446
00:49:33,478 --> 00:49:37,178
- We're have to stand down our Emergency Services.
- Surrender London?

447
00:49:37,238 --> 00:49:38,038
He's right.

448
00:49:39,658 --> 00:49:44,448
Take out all legitimate personnel.
Anyone that remains .. is a terrorist.

449
00:49:44,528 --> 00:49:45,898
Look, the sooner we end this,

450
00:49:45,948 --> 00:49:48,818
The more chance there is of stopping
London becoming a complete warzone.

451
00:49:48,878 --> 00:49:50,808
Well, how do we get the
word out to our people?

452
00:49:52,308 --> 00:49:53,468
[??] system.

453
00:49:54,248 --> 00:49:57,528
We [??] sound that, people know to
stay secure in their place, then ...

454
00:49:58,138 --> 00:49:59,628
You have the military sweep in.

455
00:50:00,728 --> 00:50:02,388
door-to-door, if necessary.

456
00:50:02,968 --> 00:50:05,048
Clear these bastards out.

457
00:50:47,378 --> 00:50:50,568
- Good evening.
- Is Auntie M in?

458
00:51:04,658 --> 00:51:05,908
Put that away.

459
00:51:08,278 --> 00:51:10,608
- Are you who I think you are?
- Unfortunately

460
00:51:21,258 --> 00:51:24,838
What a pleasure this is, two handsome men
visiting me on such a lovely evening.

461
00:51:25,948 --> 00:51:29,868
- Long time, Jackson. -- Eh, not long enough.
-- Mr. President.

462
00:51:30,818 --> 00:51:31,488
Sir,

463
00:51:31,938 --> 00:51:36,268
- Jaqueline, MI-6 finest.  Don't fuck with her.
- Hello.

464
00:51:45,418 --> 00:51:50,538
The phones are down.  That said,
It did allow us to pick up this..

465
00:51:52,928 --> 00:51:55,658
Mr. President, Banning ..

466
00:51:56,628 --> 00:52:01,568
I hope this finds you well.
Mike, we got your message.

467
00:52:03,028 --> 00:52:05,728
And I'm sure you don't know
who you can trust,

468
00:52:06,098 --> 00:52:09,018
and all prior authentications
may be compromised.

469
00:52:09,348 --> 00:52:11,618
So .. I offer you this,

470
00:52:12,388 --> 00:52:19,888
Do you have any idea the joy a man experiences pulling a
70-lb King Mackerel out of the waters around Jekyll Island?

471
00:52:20,928 --> 00:52:21,828
That's him.

472
00:52:23,908 --> 00:52:29,408
a Delta Team has been clandestinely inserted.
By now they should en route to your position.

473
00:52:29,928 --> 00:52:36,208
They'll take you to the US Embassy, where an armored
convoy stands by to get you out of SAM range.

474
00:52:36,248 --> 00:52:38,618
- And on to a military train.
- Thank god.

475
00:52:39,368 --> 00:52:42,298
- Let's get us out of here.
- Alright, sir.  So who's behind all this?

476
00:52:44,008 --> 00:52:45,428
Aamir Bakawi.

477
00:52:51,138 --> 00:52:54,278
Bakawi provides armaments.
He's a fucken criminal.

478
00:52:55,308 --> 00:52:56,658
Shielded by governments.

479
00:52:58,208 --> 00:53:02,928
Mike, there was a drone strike, to get him.
Two years ago, authorized by the G8.

480
00:53:03,018 --> 00:53:03,968
So we took a shot.

481
00:53:05,668 --> 00:53:06,988
He survived

482
00:53:07,658 --> 00:53:12,378
We didn't know his family was there.
His daughter was killed.

483
00:53:13,158 --> 00:53:15,248
Well, he certainly got his revenge.

484
00:53:16,718 --> 00:53:20,148
- Civilians?
- Well, they're not being targeted specifically, but ..

485
00:53:20,618 --> 00:53:22,828
- Collateral damage?
- Yeah, quite a lot, I'm afraid.

486
00:53:23,218 --> 00:53:27,118
[??] targeting. No official support from
any countries Barkawi shows, but..

487
00:53:27,798 --> 00:53:31,828
Didn't have any problems finding the creeps today,
United Nations all with blood on their hands. [??]

488
00:53:33,998 --> 00:53:36,988
- Who's on the inside? There's gotta be somebody.
- Yeah, you're right.

489
00:53:37,818 --> 00:53:40,448
They've infiltrated our CCTV system.

490
00:53:40,708 --> 00:53:42,478
And they've copied the Wi-Fi network. [??]

491
00:53:44,108 --> 00:53:46,758
- Yeah, but who?
- I don't know.

492
00:53:46,958 --> 00:53:49,738
Mike ..
if you hadn't move our schedule up.

493
00:53:54,628 --> 00:53:57,458
- Here you go sir, get this in you.
- Thanks.

494
00:53:57,688 --> 00:54:00,548
- I don't know about you, but I'm thirsty as fuck.
- Yeah.

495
00:54:12,568 --> 00:54:17,318
- How're you doing?
- I was thinking about my son.

496
00:54:19,958 --> 00:54:24,288
He sends me these jokes every day.
It's kind of our, our thing.

497
00:54:25,848 --> 00:54:28,608
A little off-color.
His mother wouldn't approve.

498
00:54:29,278 --> 00:54:33,488
I tell you something Mike, These little
messages I get from him everyday,

499
00:54:34,968 --> 00:54:36,878
They mean everything, you'll see.

500
00:54:39,868 --> 00:54:45,578
Most important thing, never criticize.
Always encourage.

501
00:54:47,218 --> 00:54:50,128
You just want them to be passionate.
That's what I always tell my son.

502
00:54:50,468 --> 00:54:52,628
Find something you care about, and care deeply.

503
00:54:53,938 --> 00:54:57,828
That and the Golden Rule.
Treat others as you like to be treated.

504
00:54:59,988 --> 00:55:03,378
- That's it?
- Yeah, basically.

505
00:55:03,978 --> 00:55:05,528
What about all the other stuff.

506
00:55:06,578 --> 00:55:12,118
Sleeping, eating, electrical outlets,
diapers, stairs, and ...

507
00:55:12,418 --> 00:55:14,078
That stuff takes care of itself.

508
00:55:14,598 --> 00:55:18,608
- Really?
- No, hah ha, you'll figure it out.

509
00:55:20,728 --> 00:55:22,108
Okay, your dates have arrived.

510
00:55:24,678 --> 00:55:27,498
That's under construction.
No one lives or works there.

511
00:55:28,108 --> 00:55:33,338
- That's why this is particularly interesting.
- I had my NSA analysts take a peek at the power usage ..

512
00:55:33,558 --> 00:55:35,638
Through the roof the last three weeks.

513
00:55:36,008 --> 00:55:38,978
pretty odd, considering no one
lives or works there.

514
00:55:39,858 --> 00:55:44,998
Central London.
Right under our bloody noses.

515
00:55:46,018 --> 00:55:48,078
Tell the SAS that we're going
to make a house call.

516
00:55:54,518 --> 00:55:55,548
Mike,

517
00:55:56,888 --> 00:55:58,248

There's no way to dress this up, sir.
It isn't good.

520
00:56:22,288 --> 00:56:26,138
Could be worse. Could be [??]

521
00:56:27,528 --> 00:56:30,678
Atta boy.  Don't stop for anyone.

522
00:56:53,308 --> 00:56:58,488
- Are we clear?
- Yeah, ha hah. We fucken made it.

523
00:56:59,638 --> 00:57:00,618
Ha ha, we did.

524
00:58:07,818 --> 00:58:09,118
Where is he?

525
00:58:12,348 --> 00:58:15,448
Where the fuck?  Where is he?

526
00:58:17,328 --> 00:58:18,848

Now, I'm going to go get him.
And you can kill me,

538

Or you can come with me.

539

542
00:59:31,708 --> 00:59:34,798
Disable the authorization code

How many men get to experience
their death witnessed by billions .. live?

548
01:00:15,928 --> 01:00:17,808
You are going to go down in history.

549

- You don't understand,

554
01:00:54,618 --> 01:00:58,258
We have NSA imagery of where you're going.
It's their base of operations.

555

There are nealy a 100 terrorists in there.

556
01:01:01,128 --> 01:01:03,648
Yeah, well.
They should have brought more men.

557
01:01:09,988 --> 01:01:12,928
- Things are ready to get sporty.
- Just watch your balls.

558
01:01:13,358 --> 01:01:14,558
Will do.

559
01:01:58,548 --> 01:01:59,768

561
01:03:20,788 --> 01:03:24,208
Yeah, they kill the President
the second we try it.

Alright call Fox Command .. [??] the utilities here.. [??]

- Let's pull out the plug. -- Yeah.

01:03:43,208 --> 01:03:46,008
- What happened?
- The power supply was just cut.

566
01:03:46,088 --> 01:03:48,288
Get the emergency generators up.
Come on!

567
01:03:52,668 --> 01:03:56,408
Banning, this is what we got.
This is a three-story building..

568
01:03:56,518 --> 01:04:00,868
The entry point is here.  There are
two stairwells. One here, and one here.

569
01:04:01,108 --> 01:04:05,038
We believe the President is being held
in this room, on the second floor.

570
01:04:06,208 --> 01:04:09,608
Hold your position. I need you to hit
this building with everything you got.

No!
The whole world needs to see this.

Hear that, Kamran?
That's the sound of inevitability.

578
01:06:39,348 --> 01:06:44,098
I am going to kill you live. But that doesn't
mean you can't suffer privately first.

579
01:06:55,618 --> 01:06:56,768
Look at me!

580

to make you better about yourself.
