00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:25,710
(Vehicle Approaching)

00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:56,740
(Indistinct Chattering)

3
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:33,230
Une bière, s'il vous plaît.

4
00:02:52,790 --> 00:02:54,550
Merci.

5
00:04:35,230 --> 00:04:37,060
(Door Opens)

6
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:40,480
(French) We are closed.

7
00:04:40,610 --> 00:04:42,320
Just a small drink.

8
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:51,080
The toilets?

9
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:56,830
(Telephone)

10
00:05:37,210 --> 00:05:39,040
(Door Opens)

11
00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:47,760
(French)
A quick drink and then I'll leave.

12
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,680
(Irish Accent)
Why are you rushing off?

13
00:05:52,850 --> 00:05:55,980
- Hmm?
- I said, why are you rushing off?

14
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:57,770
(French) I don't understand.

15
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:01,020
The man from Bristol called ya.

16
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:09,410
- What man?
- The man in the wheelchair.

17
00:06:09,570 --> 00:06:11,950
(Car Horn)

18
00:06:15,910 --> 00:06:18,580
(Vehicle Pulls Up)

19
00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:48,490
What were you doing back here?

20
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:51,490
Lady,...

21
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:55,160
... I never walk into a place
I don't know how to walk out of.

22
00:06:56,410 --> 00:06:58,290
Then why would you get into that van?

23
00:06:58,410 --> 00:07:00,790
You know the reason.

24
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:14,030
Make yourselves at home.

25
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,660
You've come a long way.

26
00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:19,750
- Thanks for coming.
- What's the job?

27
00:08:19,910 --> 00:08:23,620
There's some people
who have something we require.

28
00:08:23,790 --> 00:08:27,170
- And we want you to get it from them.
- It involves shooting?

29
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:30,880
You must be tired.

30
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:33,180
We'll tell you more tomorrow.

31
00:08:39,850 --> 00:08:43,980
Seven fat years
and seven lean years.

32
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:46,900
- That's what it says in the Bible.
- You ever kill anybody?

33
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:49,570
I hurt somebody's feelings once.

34
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,870
Don't I know you?

35
00:08:59,910 --> 00:09:03,410
I don't think so. I'd remember.

36
00:09:10,590 --> 00:09:12,420
Okay, two-hour shifts.

37
00:09:12,590 --> 00:09:15,260
I'll watch the front,
you guys watch the back.

38
00:09:17,550 --> 00:09:19,100
Merci.

39
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:25,980
(Truck Horn)

40
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:33,820
You awake, then?

41
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:38,240
Hmm?

42
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:42,620
How we doing?

43
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:48,830
Yep.

44
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:08,980
You labour or management?

45
00:10:09,230 --> 00:10:13,230
If I was management,
I wouldn't have given you a cigarette.

46
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:18,990
I am the tour guide.
Over there is the Eiffel Tower.

47
00:10:19,110 --> 00:10:21,830
Over here, the Louvre.
Over there, les toilettes.

48
00:10:21,990 --> 00:10:24,290
What do I call you?

49
00:10:24,450 --> 00:10:27,120
- My name is Vincent.
- Sam.

50
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:35,050
As per the agreement,
your salary will be $5,000 a week...

51
00:10:35,170 --> 00:10:37,840
...with a minimum
of four weeks work.

52
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:40,340
On the successful completion
of the mission,...

53
00:10:40,510 --> 00:10:44,310
...you will each receive
a bonus of $20,000.

54
00:10:45,810 --> 00:10:49,850
And by the way,
my name is Deirdre.

55
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:52,900
- The broad outlines of the mission are...
- Who are your principals?

56
00:10:53,070 --> 00:10:54,860
For you,
there's no one but myself.

57
00:10:55,110 --> 00:10:56,990
Huh?

58
00:10:57,110 --> 00:11:00,070
And what can we infer
from your charming Irish lilt?

59
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:03,280
- Anything you like.
- Where's the equipment?

60
00:11:03,450 --> 00:11:05,950
Tell me what you need, make a list,
and give it to Vincent.

61
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:09,290
- Some of the equipment's quite technical.
- If it's in Paris, I'll find it.

62
00:11:09,410 --> 00:11:12,880
This is what we're after.

63
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:16,960
We need to take it intact from several
men who'll be intent on preventing us.

64
00:11:17,130 --> 00:11:19,340
- How many men?
- You American?

65
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:23,300
I think the group will be between
five and eight. No more than eight.

66
00:11:23,470 --> 00:11:27,980
- You don't know for sure?
- Not now but I will know before the event.

67
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:31,600
If you don't know,
why say between five and eight?

68
00:11:31,730 --> 00:11:33,610
There's two to three cars.
The group's traveling.

69
00:11:33,730 --> 00:11:35,070
- They're not in Paris?
- No.

70
00:11:35,190 --> 00:11:36,070
Where are they?

71
00:11:36,230 --> 00:11:38,780
- You'll find out soon enough.
- What's in the case?

72
00:11:40,530 --> 00:11:43,450
Our plan, in broad strokes, is an ambush.

73
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:46,120
It's to hit the car,
to take them in transit.

74
00:11:46,290 --> 00:11:50,000
- Transit? City? Country?
- Right now, as I said, I don't know.

75
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:52,500
But we've to move very quickly.

76
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:57,050
We'll start with this: Ambush
and assault on two to three vehicles,...

77
00:11:57,170 --> 00:12:01,840
...five to eight men, and our objective
is the safe retrieval of this case.

78
00:12:01,970 --> 00:12:05,640
Tell Vincent
what it is you'll need.

79
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:10,600
What do we know about them?
Are they French? Who are they?

80
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:14,020
All you need to know right now
is that they're very unpleasant.

81
00:12:14,190 --> 00:12:18,730
- You've done this kind of thing before?
- You know...

82
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:19,940
How difficult can it be?

83
00:12:20,070 --> 00:12:22,150
We have no idea
how these men will be armed?

84
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,700
It seems they'll be
very well armed, indeed.

85
00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:26,870
Where are we going and
how are we getting back from there?

86
00:12:26,990 --> 00:12:30,120
It'll be in France, and the group
will disband at the RV point.

87
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:33,870
- (French) What does she mean?
- After that, we're on our own.

88
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,670
- It's a military term.
- That's right.

89
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:38,340
Larry, tell Vincent what you'll need.

90
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:43,340
Something very fast. Audi S-8.
Something that can shove.

91
00:12:43,470 --> 00:12:46,180
I'm going to have it for you
by the afternoon.

92
00:12:46,350 --> 00:12:49,970
I'll also need a nitrous system.
I've got the specs.

93
00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:57,060
What do you use, weapons-wise?

94
00:12:57,230 --> 00:12:59,400
- Hmm?
- Weapons.

95
00:12:59,530 --> 00:13:02,570
- I'm a... I'm a weapons man.
- Weapons man.

96
00:13:02,690 --> 00:13:04,570
- Yeah.
- Okay.

97
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:08,700
They tend to settle the argument.
So what do you favor?

98
00:13:08,870 --> 00:13:12,410
Well, you know. It's a toolbox.
You put the tools in for the job.

99
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:13,710
What?

100
00:13:13,830 --> 00:13:16,920
You know,
I actually favor the old 191 1 .

101
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:20,420
.45. Old gun.

102
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:24,380
It served my country well.
A long time.

103
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:26,890
Your country!

104
00:13:27,050 --> 00:13:29,050
Not done too well, have you,
last few wars?

105
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:31,600
Perhaps not, but at least
we don't go around whining about it.

106
00:13:34,270 --> 00:13:35,020
You ex-military?

107
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:37,100
No, I got my job
through the New York Times.

108
00:13:38,730 --> 00:13:41,980
- (French) Don't let him get you down.
- It don't mean nothing to me.

109
00:13:42,110 --> 00:13:43,900
I say what I think.

110
00:13:44,030 --> 00:13:46,450
Are you ex-military?

111
00:13:46,610 --> 00:13:48,780
Boys at Hereford?

112
00:13:48,950 --> 00:13:51,620
I'm sorry, but I'd like to go backwards.
The line of retreat is...

113
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:56,210
She just told you.
We meet back at the RV, disband.

114
00:13:56,370 --> 00:14:00,290
I understand. I'm just trying to get
a vague notion of the opposition.

115
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:06,090
We're gonna cause some animosity.
How many will be coming after us?

116
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:09,260
- You worried about your own skin?
- Yeah, I am.

117
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:11,260
It covers my body.

118
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:16,060
All your concerns will be addressed
before we leave.

119
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:18,690
- Electronics and commo.
- Not more than three cars?

120
00:14:18,810 --> 00:14:20,190
That is our information.

121
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:23,030
- Can you get me a simulator?
- What's a simulator?

122
00:14:23,150 --> 00:14:26,360
Gunpowder. Sound only, no lead.
Sounds like a pistol.

123
00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:28,030
Quite diverting.

124
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:31,780
Listen, I'm also gonna need
some bigger injection jets.

125
00:14:31,910 --> 00:14:34,580
The Bosch is not gonna do it.
They have to be custom-made.

126
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:37,620
We going north? We going south?

127
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:40,960
I'd like some new clothes.

128
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:43,750
- Vincent will sort you out.
- I'll take care of it.

129
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:53,760
- So what brought you here?
- A fella that doesn't work so well.

130
00:14:55,140 --> 00:14:57,480
The man in the wheelchair?

131
00:14:58,390 --> 00:14:59,850
How did he get there?

132
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:04,780
That was in your neck of the woods,
back in the late unpleasantness.

133
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:17,450
Good reflexes.

134
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,750
Oh, yeah.

135
00:15:21,290 --> 00:15:23,460
They die hard.

136
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:34,010
- Interrogation.
- What?

137
00:15:34,140 --> 00:15:38,180
- Methods to withstand interrogation.
- You've done that?

138
00:15:38,350 --> 00:15:41,270
We were taught
to hold out indefinitely.

139
00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:46,820
- Nobody can hold out indefinitely.
- Ah, is that so?

140
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:52,530
Everybody has a limit. I spent
some time in interrogation... once.

141
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:54,990
- They make it hard on you?
- They don't make it easy.

142
00:15:55,370 --> 00:15:59,410
Yeah, it was unpleasant.
I held out as long as I could.

143
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:02,210
All the stuff they tried.

144
00:16:02,330 --> 00:16:04,630
You just can't hold out for ever.

145
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:07,420
- Impossible.
- How'd they finally get to you?

146
00:16:07,590 --> 00:16:10,300
- They gave me a grasshopper.
- What's a grasshopper?

147
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:14,930
That's two part gin, two part brandy,
one part crème de menthe...

148
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:17,100
Fucking smartass!

149
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:20,980
- Can you find this place?
- Of course.

150
00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:23,020
I know it.

151
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:26,150
That's where
they wanna do the exchange.

152
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:28,110
You're gonna exchange for cash?

153
00:16:29,150 --> 00:16:33,240
- You know these people?
- My people know them.

154
00:16:33,410 --> 00:16:35,620
Your people have done business
with them before?

155
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:38,540
Or these people
just gave your people a number?

156
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:51,590
Larry.

157
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:58,930
Okay. If we're gonna do it,
let's do the goddamn thing right.

158
00:17:01,850 --> 00:17:04,600
- Hey!
- I'm busy.

159
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:08,190
Okay, come on. Let's go.

160
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:11,820
The answers to your questions
I'll know when I get back.

161
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:15,030
- I'll go with you.
- Go with them.

162
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:37,180
Who does this girl work for?

163
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:41,640
Well, she works for our betters.

164
00:17:41,770 --> 00:17:44,940
It seems that's what
we're meant to know.

165
00:17:52,730 --> 00:17:55,700
Always a waiting game.

166
00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:59,620
- What?
- It's a waiting game.

167
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:05,410
Hey, wait.
Would you not do that, please?

168
00:18:07,540 --> 00:18:10,590
Bad for the night vision, yeah?

169
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:19,050
There they are.

170
00:19:07,390 --> 00:19:10,060
- You have the list?
- Yes, I have it.

171
00:19:10,230 --> 00:19:11,900
Give it to me.

172
00:19:15,230 --> 00:19:17,740
Money?

173
00:19:19,030 --> 00:19:21,530
Okay. You follow my lead.

174
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:23,910
Just make sure you watch my back.

175
00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:30,370
(French) Don't make any sudden moves.

176
00:19:30,870 --> 00:19:34,420
Just because we're buying guns
doesn't mean we didn't bring any.

177
00:19:34,550 --> 00:19:37,800
Don't worry. Everything's fine.

178
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:43,050
You want to back him up?

179
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:49,140
What would I profit from your death?

180
00:19:49,270 --> 00:19:52,690
- Well, you'd have the money.
- I have the money already.

181
00:19:54,650 --> 00:19:57,070
I'll watch the back.

182
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,780
- (French) Have you got it all?
- Oui.

183
00:20:04,660 --> 00:20:08,000
- You're sure?
- Of course. Come and see.

184
00:20:18,340 --> 00:20:19,300
There it is!

185
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:41,740
It's not all here.

186
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:45,910
- Vincent.
- What?

187
00:20:49,910 --> 00:20:52,580
It's not all here.

188
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:54,500
- C'est tout?
- Ah, non, non, non.

189
00:20:54,710 --> 00:20:58,920
Le patron va contrôler I'argent.
Vous aurez le reste de la marchandise.

190
00:20:59,050 --> 00:21:03,050
Tiens. Il est lå dans la voiture,
avec le patron.

191
00:21:03,180 --> 00:21:07,600
He said the rest is in the other car.
The boss wants to check the money.

192
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:10,890
(French)
If he agrees, we have no problem.

193
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:12,810
Here, take the car keys.

194
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:15,980
Go on. Take them.

195
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:21,650
Come on. Come.

196
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:25,990
Okay, give me...
Give me some of the money.

197
00:21:33,210 --> 00:21:36,170
Give me some of the money!

198
00:21:38,170 --> 00:21:40,420
- Okay.
- You aren't going in there?

199
00:21:40,550 --> 00:21:44,680
- Yeah, I am, and so are you.
- Why am I going in there?

200
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:48,800
- Why? To protect me.
- There is no protection there.

201
00:21:48,930 --> 00:21:52,390
If it's a come-on, we're fish in a barrel.
Why do they want you in there?

202
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:54,890
- What are you, crazy?
- You know, you think too hard.

203
00:21:55,060 --> 00:21:58,650
Nobody ever told me that before.
But I wouldn't go in there.

204
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:03,860
- What is it, Sam?
- I don't like it. Look at it.

205
00:22:05,570 --> 00:22:07,410
Okay, okay.

206
00:22:07,570 --> 00:22:09,950
Okay, let's just do it.
Let's just do it and be done, yeah?

207
00:22:10,950 --> 00:22:12,330
You don't wanna go in there.

208
00:22:13,910 --> 00:22:17,830
- I'm getting paid to go. It's that simple.
- Okay, come on. Let's go.

209
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:21,550
If anything goes down,
get next to one of those guys.

210
00:22:21,670 --> 00:22:23,800
If there's a sniper,
he'll be afraid to shoot his own guy.

211
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:25,590
- Let's go!
- All right.

212
00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:49,660
Stop!

213
00:22:49,780 --> 00:22:51,950
(French) Stay where you are.

214
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:10,430
So, everything's fine.

215
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:17,060
(Boat Horn)

216
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:23,400
Shit! I can't see! I can't see!

217
00:23:36,450 --> 00:23:38,330
Have some of this!

218
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,550
Fucking arse-hole!

219
00:23:49,170 --> 00:23:52,300
- Fucking have some more, you bastards!
- (Siren)

220
00:23:54,050 --> 00:23:55,930
Come on! Come on!

221
00:23:57,390 --> 00:23:59,770
- (Gunfire Continues)
- Let's go!

222
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:04,150
- No! You goddamn...
- Come on! Let's go!

223
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:19,120
- Is anybody hurt?
- We're fine.

224
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:25,880
Almost a bit of raspberry jam
back there, yeah?

225
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,880
A bit of raspberry jam back there!

226
00:24:28,010 --> 00:24:30,050
(Tyres Screeching)

227
00:24:31,630 --> 00:24:35,300
Got the swag, kept the money.
Job well done.

228
00:24:35,430 --> 00:24:37,310
That's a fact. That is a fact.

229
00:24:37,470 --> 00:24:39,220
(Siren)

230
00:25:02,830 --> 00:25:03,920
Slow down. Slow down.

231
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:08,170
I think I have to stop.

232
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:37,950
Thank you.

233
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:41,450
(Spence Coughing)

234
00:25:49,590 --> 00:25:51,420
Why did you take this job?

235
00:25:54,010 --> 00:25:56,010
My friend, I need the money.

236
00:25:57,180 --> 00:25:59,510
(French) The money is here.

237
00:26:03,850 --> 00:26:06,980
That's what this is, you know? Money.

238
00:26:11,110 --> 00:26:12,990
Yeah, but who are our employers?

239
00:26:15,650 --> 00:26:17,490
You're right.

240
00:26:20,990 --> 00:26:23,910
(Tannoy announcement in French)

241
00:26:46,020 --> 00:26:47,850
Excuse me.

242
00:26:48,020 --> 00:26:50,520
Excuse me, monsieur.

243
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:01,700
(Irish Accent)
The Russians are bidding for the case.

244
00:27:01,830 --> 00:27:05,830
The case is in Nice.
They're trying to sell it to the Russians.

245
00:27:05,950 --> 00:27:09,210
They're staying at
the Villa Belle Mer in Nice.

246
00:27:10,380 --> 00:27:14,840
- The team isn't ready.
- Whatever the team is, you do it now.

247
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:18,050
The Russians have decided to bid.
We need to move now.

248
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:20,220
Excuse me.

249
00:27:20,470 --> 00:27:23,850
I have the information.
We'll be moving very soon.

250
00:27:24,010 --> 00:27:25,890
It'll definitely
be in the nature of an ambush...

251
00:27:26,060 --> 00:27:29,850
...somewhere between here and here.

252
00:27:30,020 --> 00:27:34,400
We'll anticipate
a three-car convoy with a backup team.

253
00:27:34,530 --> 00:27:38,030
We will try and stop the target
before they can get away from us.

254
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:40,110
- What's in the case?
- That information isn't necessary.

255
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:42,240
Is it heavy? Is it explosive?

256
00:27:42,410 --> 00:27:44,370
Is it chained
to some unlucky bloke's wrist?

257
00:27:44,540 --> 00:27:46,540
- Are we gonna have to chop it off?
- All right.

258
00:27:46,660 --> 00:27:48,830
I don't have to let you know...

259
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:52,290
Then the price has got to go up.

260
00:27:52,460 --> 00:27:54,250
I'll get you the case,
but the price has gotta go up.

261
00:27:54,420 --> 00:27:57,130
If it's gonna be amateur night,
I want $100,000. I want it up front.

262
00:27:57,260 --> 00:28:01,970
I want it in a bank account. I want
another $100,000 when you get the case.

263
00:28:19,530 --> 00:28:22,030
(Dialing)

264
00:28:34,290 --> 00:28:37,170
Okay.

265
00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:42,590
We've got shooters here, shooters here.

266
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:44,550
I'll tell you an old trick.

267
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:45,350
Hey.

268
00:28:55,110 --> 00:28:57,770
- What's your problem?
- Draw it again.

269
00:28:59,190 --> 00:29:02,400
Draw it again.
You're the ace field man. Draw it again.

270
00:29:02,570 --> 00:29:06,200
It's a simple diagram.
Just draw it again. Draw what you saw.

271
00:29:06,330 --> 00:29:10,870
Draw it again! Draw it again.

272
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:17,500
Two shooters.
Car comes through here.

273
00:29:17,630 --> 00:29:19,590
Shooters across from each other,
kill each other dead.

274
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:22,550
- Oh, my. Where'd you learn that?
- In a regiment.

275
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:25,180
- What regiment was that?
- The 22nd Special Air Service.

276
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:27,680
What's the color
of the boathouse at Hereford?

277
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:30,390
What's the color
of the boathouse at Hereford?

278
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:32,430
- I don't like your attitude.
- What's the color of the boathouse...

279
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:35,060
- Fuck off!
- What's... You got the gun. I'm unarmed.

280
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:38,150
Do something. Go ahead.
Do something. Do something.

281
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:40,190
Do something.

282
00:29:51,370 --> 00:29:53,870
Tell me about an ambush?
Don't tell me about an ambush!

283
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:57,000
I ambushed you with a cup of coffee.

284
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:03,130
You'll get your money
when we get the case.

285
00:30:03,260 --> 00:30:06,010
- The others, too.
- That is what I understood.

286
00:30:06,130 --> 00:30:07,970
Come on.
We've gotten the word. We're moving.

287
00:30:15,390 --> 00:30:17,270
Put this near the front.

288
00:30:18,860 --> 00:30:22,150
Careful! Careful with that!

289
00:30:33,410 --> 00:30:37,000
So what color
is the boathouse at Hereford?

290
00:30:37,170 --> 00:30:39,040
How the fuck should I know?

291
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:03,360
This'll complete your compensation.

292
00:31:06,860 --> 00:31:09,820
Thanks for your time.
Feel free to leave when we're gone.

293
00:31:11,530 --> 00:31:13,370
Do I need to suggest that you forget us?

294
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:18,750
Because we will not forget.

295
00:31:59,290 --> 00:32:00,870
(Computer Beeping)

296
00:32:23,610 --> 00:32:27,070
- Morning.
- I see you're reviewing our problem.

297
00:32:27,190 --> 00:32:29,780
Well, either you're part of the problem,
part of the solution,...

298
00:32:29,900 --> 00:32:32,070
- ...or you're just part of the landscape.
- Indeed.

299
00:32:33,490 --> 00:32:34,700
What's in the case?

300
00:32:35,830 --> 00:32:38,160
Something we're paying ya for.

301
00:32:53,140 --> 00:32:57,350
- You and the girl are in front of the hotel.
- The name's Deirdre.

302
00:32:57,510 --> 00:33:00,480
Deirdre.
Wait outside the hotel for the target.

303
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:03,020
He leaves the hotel for the villa,
the villa for the hotel.

304
00:33:03,190 --> 00:33:04,310
He activates his cellphone.

305
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:06,230
How do you know
he's gonna use his cellphone?

306
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:09,230
- He'll use a phone.
- How do you know?

307
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:11,740
- I'm gonna call him on it.
- How do you know he'll have it with him?

308
00:33:11,900 --> 00:33:14,070
He's waiting for a call.

309
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:18,450
His people will call him to tell him
the location of the meet.

310
00:33:18,620 --> 00:33:20,450
- Okay?
- Okay.

311
00:33:20,580 --> 00:33:23,870
The villa, the hotel, the car,
the stop light, 8 to 10 guys.

312
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:25,880
How good's their...
How good's their security?

313
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:29,050
- I can't tell you.
- Well, let's find out. Where are they?

314
00:33:29,170 --> 00:33:31,050
The last report, they were at the hotel.

315
00:33:31,220 --> 00:33:33,050
- The case is at the hotel?
- We presume that it is.

316
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:35,930
- That's interesting.
- Why don't we do it now?

317
00:33:36,050 --> 00:33:39,390
- It's tempting.
- It's a good plan. Let's stick to the plan.

318
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:43,230
Everybody wants to go to the party.
Nobody wants to stay and clean up.

319
00:33:43,350 --> 00:33:45,690
- Please.
- The only thing is that the map...

320
00:33:45,810 --> 00:33:48,480
...the map is not the territory.

321
00:33:49,900 --> 00:33:51,440
Let's go look at the ground.

322
00:33:51,570 --> 00:33:54,530
Bring some money.
We're gonna do a little shopping.

323
00:34:02,910 --> 00:34:04,670
Listen up.

324
00:34:05,830 --> 00:34:08,710
You're my wife.
Be who you wanna look like.

325
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:11,960
It's just a game. Just a game.

326
00:34:12,090 --> 00:34:14,880
Man and a woman going for a walk.

327
00:34:15,010 --> 00:34:18,640
Piece of cake.
Relax. Relax, darling.

328
00:34:20,350 --> 00:34:22,220
You look good cleaned up.

329
00:34:26,270 --> 00:34:28,150
Is that the hotel?

330
00:34:43,830 --> 00:34:46,620
Put your arm under mine.
Put your arm under mine.

331
00:34:48,540 --> 00:34:51,750
Why aren't they at the villa?
Why are they down here?

332
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:54,010
Fun and games?
Pretty girls and beer or what?

333
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:02,180
(Indistinct Chattering In French)

334
00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:11,230
(French) Can I help you, sir?

335
00:35:11,570 --> 00:35:13,570
No. We're looking at the menu.

336
00:35:20,030 --> 00:35:21,410
Merci.

A little.

339
00:35:55,780 --> 00:35:58,490
Could you take a picture
of me and my wife?

340
00:35:58,650 --> 00:36:01,320
It's very easy. You press like that.

341

Can you get that palm tree in?
We wanna show we're on the Riviera.

- Just snap away.

346

- So what have we learned?
- Can it be done?

358
00:37:20,690 --> 00:37:23,240
It can be done.
We should have two more men.

359
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:26,120
- We don't have two more men.
- Go to your handler.

360

- There is no handler.
- Let me go.

There's no handler.
There's only me.

we're gonna need some more men.

363
00:37:33,710 --> 00:37:36,840
There's no more help,
there's no more men. Are you afraid?

364
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,340
Of course I'm afraid. You think
I'm reluctant because I'm happy?

365
00:37:39,460 --> 00:37:42,720
We've made a good plan,
and we're gonna stick with it.

- If I take the report, I got nothing else.

386

They at the villa?

So how did you get started
in this business?

390
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:56,230
A wealthy scoundrel
seduced and betrayed me.

391
00:39:57,600 --> 00:39:59,940

- Then don't make me.

510
00:58:40,930 --> 00:58:42,770
My price just went up 300%.

511
00:58:44,600 --> 00:58:48,690
I want the package, Gregor.
What do I have to do to get it?

512
00:58:48,860 --> 00:58:50,730
Just wait for my next phone call.

513
00:58:50,860 --> 00:58:53,320
I'll find a place
where I can tilt the field in my favor.

514
00:58:53,570 --> 00:58:56,370
(Siren)

515
00:59:37,610 --> 00:59:40,330
Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me.

516
00:59:40,490 --> 00:59:42,660
Could you tell me
how to find a post office?

517
00:59:42,830 --> 00:59:46,040
Do... Do I know you?
I'm sorry. Do I know you?

518
00:59:46,210 --> 00:59:48,460
How did you know I speak English?

519
00:59:48,580 --> 00:59:50,960
You got an English newspaper.

520
00:59:51,130 --> 00:59:53,010
Sorry.

521
00:59:53,130 --> 00:59:55,130
- I'm sorry. I beg your pardon.
- It's all right.

522
00:59:55,260 --> 00:59:57,800
Uh, what do you need
a post office for?

523
00:59:57,930 --> 01:00:00,720
'Cause over here,
they use them for different things.

524
01:00:00,850 --> 01:00:01,720
I need your help.

525
01:00:03,430 --> 01:00:05,270
- I thought you left.
- I did leave.

526
01:00:05,430 --> 01:00:07,600
- You did leave? You're out?
- That's right.

527
01:00:07,730 --> 01:00:10,060
Can you help me? I need your help.

528
01:00:12,110 --> 01:00:13,940
What's the number?

529
01:00:18,360 --> 01:00:21,200
Yeah, the post office is, uh,
just down to your left.

530
01:00:21,370 --> 01:00:23,080
- Up on the left? Thanks.
- On the left.

531
01:00:31,080 --> 01:00:34,880
- A friend of yours?
- We went to high school together.

532
01:00:35,050 --> 01:00:38,300
Everyone's your brother
until the rent comes due.

533
01:00:38,430 --> 01:00:39,970
Ain't that the truth!

534
01:00:40,140 --> 01:00:42,550
(French) Yes. Yes, on the terrace?

535
01:00:43,010 --> 01:00:44,430
Facing me? I see him.

536
01:00:44,560 --> 01:00:47,600
Yes, I'll get him. Hang on, please.

537
01:00:52,110 --> 01:00:53,570
Excuse me, sir. Are you Sam?

538
01:00:56,570 --> 01:00:57,400
Yeah.

539
01:00:57,530 --> 01:00:58,950
Telephone for you.

540
01:01:07,870 --> 01:01:09,750
Yeah, good to see you, too.

541
01:01:09,870 --> 01:01:12,710
If his position changes, I'll let you know.

542
01:01:19,420 --> 01:01:21,430
Gregor's in a town called Arles.

543
01:02:37,540 --> 01:02:39,920
He's at the arena.

544
01:02:59,820 --> 01:03:02,650
(Telephone)

545
01:03:12,370 --> 01:03:15,330
[Woman]
So this is the amphitheater of Arles...

546
01:03:15,500 --> 01:03:19,460
...which was built
at the end of the first century AD.

547
01:03:19,630 --> 01:03:22,010
It is built with limestone.

548
01:03:29,510 --> 01:03:30,760
I know those men.

549
01:04:03,090 --> 01:04:06,090
[Woman] And you can see
this dominant yellow color...

550
01:04:06,220 --> 01:04:08,720
...which is actually caused
essentially by a lantern.

551
01:04:08,840 --> 01:04:11,560
We're not sure that the walls
were actually yellow.

552
01:04:11,680 --> 01:04:13,560
And so,
now we will continue...

553
01:04:13,720 --> 01:04:16,310
...and visit the Roman baths
down this way.

554
01:04:25,280 --> 01:04:27,240
(Tour Guide Speaking French)

555
01:04:27,360 --> 01:04:28,160
(Telephone)

556
01:04:29,990 --> 01:04:31,830
Yeah.

557
01:04:34,370 --> 01:04:38,250
[Gregor] Thank you, gentlemen.
That'll do nicely.

558
01:04:40,210 --> 01:04:42,040
It's Sergi. I remember you.

559
01:04:42,210 --> 01:04:44,920
(Russian Accent) Yes, Gregor, it's me.

560
01:04:45,050 --> 01:04:48,800
- How have you been?
- Well. These are trying times.

561
01:04:48,970 --> 01:04:52,010
- I'm sorry about the unfortunate incident.
- Oh, yeah.

562
01:04:52,220 --> 01:04:55,600
It was excessive.
And more to the point, it was foolish.

563
01:04:55,720 --> 01:04:58,440
I couldn't agree with you more.

564
01:04:58,560 --> 01:05:00,850
Mikhi did it without consulting me.

565
01:05:02,480 --> 01:05:05,190
Yeah, he's turned rogue
and can't be controlled, is that it?

566
01:05:18,210 --> 01:05:20,920
Excusez-moi.
Je cherche la vieille maison de Van Gogh.

567
01:05:21,080 --> 01:05:24,130
- I don't... I don't...
- Oh, English.

568
01:05:24,250 --> 01:05:26,130
Sorry. Such a fool.

569
01:05:26,300 --> 01:05:28,130
I was looking for Van Gogh's old house.

570
01:05:28,260 --> 01:05:32,640
So what could have been conducted
in a collegial atmosphere...

571
01:05:32,800 --> 01:05:34,850
...is now fucked into a cocked hat.

572
01:05:34,970 --> 01:05:38,890
- What do you think?
- [Sergi] I think we'll meet your price.

573
01:05:40,600 --> 01:05:44,690
Yeah. Yes, so let's see it. Let's see it now.

574
01:05:44,820 --> 01:05:46,190
Where do you have it, in your belt?

575
01:05:46,400 --> 01:05:48,990
- Let's see it!
- Show me the case first.

576
01:05:51,320 --> 01:05:54,450
You're great in the locker room,
and your reflexes might die hard,...

577
01:05:54,620 --> 01:05:56,450
...but you're weak
when you put your spikes on.

578
01:05:58,080 --> 01:06:02,040
- Gregor? Are you all right?
- Gregor's fine.

579
01:06:02,210 --> 01:06:04,880
But I think you're in a wee spot of trouble.

580
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:08,760
- Where is it? Where is it?
- I don't have it with me.

581
01:06:08,880 --> 01:06:09,840
Where?

582
01:06:09,970 --> 01:06:12,430
I mailed it to myself.
A post-office box in Paris.

583
01:06:12,550 --> 01:06:13,550
Hilfe!

584
01:06:13,680 --> 01:06:15,350
Help! He's robbing me!

585
01:06:17,310 --> 01:06:20,060
(Crowd Shouting)

586
01:06:54,550 --> 01:06:56,550
[Vincent] Pardon. Pardon.

587
01:06:56,720 --> 01:06:58,470
Pardon. Avancez!

588
01:06:58,640 --> 01:06:59,430
Pardon.

589
01:07:01,390 --> 01:07:02,640
(Gunfire)

590
01:07:54,070 --> 01:07:55,900
(Groaning)

591
01:08:03,950 --> 01:08:04,750
Stop.

592
01:08:08,540 --> 01:08:11,210
- Where do I know you from?
- Vienna.

593
01:08:11,340 --> 01:08:14,920
Of course. I'm sorry to have to do this.

594
01:08:15,050 --> 01:08:16,050
Hey!

595
01:08:34,400 --> 01:08:36,110
- Christ.
- Drive.

596
01:08:51,710 --> 01:08:54,550
(Siren)

597
01:08:58,300 --> 01:09:03,390
Stop! Descends! Vite! Descends!

598
01:09:20,610 --> 01:09:27,830
- I'm gonna have to take care of this.
- What do you want to do?

599
01:09:27,960 --> 01:09:31,710
Uh, get to a doctor
or a veterinarian's office.

600
01:09:31,880 --> 01:09:34,090
I'll just boost what I need.

601
01:09:37,880 --> 01:09:41,510
- Could you do that?
- Of course. I can do better.

602
01:09:44,260 --> 01:09:46,470
- How is it?
- I'm leaking.

603
01:09:47,890 --> 01:09:49,560
I'm sorry.

604
01:09:54,270 --> 01:09:56,110
That girl sold us out.

605
01:10:00,780 --> 01:10:03,620
She sold us out.

606
01:10:25,930 --> 01:10:27,810
(Dogs Barking)

607
01:10:55,250 --> 01:10:58,170
- (French) Ready, Jean-Pierre?
- Everything's ready.

608
01:11:17,520 --> 01:11:19,480
Get my legs up.

609
01:11:19,610 --> 01:11:21,490
Careful.

610
01:11:31,080 --> 01:11:33,250
Are you sure you can do this?

611
01:11:33,410 --> 01:11:36,960
Yeah. I once removed a guy's appendix
with a grapefruit spoon.

612
01:11:37,130 --> 01:11:40,340
- Have a drink.
- No booze. No.

613
01:11:46,090 --> 01:11:51,060
Easy, easy, easy.

614
01:11:57,100 --> 01:12:00,900
It's just below the surface.

615
01:12:02,440 --> 01:12:05,570
All right, let's do it.
Just douse it with alcohol.

616
01:12:05,740 --> 01:12:08,910
(Opens Bottle, Liquid Pouring)

617
01:12:09,070 --> 01:12:11,540
Take the gauze and wipe away
as much of the blood as you can.

618
01:12:11,700 --> 01:12:13,830
Keep it clean so I can see it.

619
01:12:18,290 --> 01:12:20,170
Yeah. That's it.

620
01:12:27,050 --> 01:12:29,140
All right. What we're gonna do is routine.

621
01:12:29,300 --> 01:12:31,810
I've done this many times before.

622
01:12:31,970 --> 01:12:34,100
There are no vital organs, arteries.
It's okay.

623
01:12:34,270 --> 01:12:36,310
You won't kill me.
Just make sure you get the bullet...

624
01:12:36,440 --> 01:12:38,480
- ...before you pry it out.
- All right.

625
01:12:38,650 --> 01:12:40,480
Take that scalpel.

626
01:12:45,030 --> 01:12:46,900
The upper part.

627
01:12:48,530 --> 01:12:50,490
Over here. Just cut up there.

628
01:12:50,620 --> 01:12:52,490
Just a little cut.

629
01:12:59,210 --> 01:13:02,040
(Grunts)

630
01:13:03,460 --> 01:13:05,300
Okay. Got it.

631
01:13:07,220 --> 01:13:09,050
Now take the clamp.

632
01:13:09,220 --> 01:13:11,890
Take the clamp and open up... the hole.

633
01:13:12,050 --> 01:13:14,600
Just put it in there.

634
01:13:15,720 --> 01:13:17,600
Put it in there.

635
01:13:17,730 --> 01:13:19,600
That's it. Put it in. Just...

636
01:13:19,770 --> 01:13:21,980
Now open it up. Spread it. Spread it.

637
01:13:22,110 --> 01:13:24,440
Okay. Okay.

638
01:13:24,570 --> 01:13:27,610
Now get the other...
Get the other clamps and get the bullet.

639
01:13:27,740 --> 01:13:29,740
Remember, don't take it out
unless you really got it.

640
01:13:32,280 --> 01:13:35,120
(Groaning)

641
01:13:39,250 --> 01:13:41,120
(Groans Loudly)

642
01:13:46,050 --> 01:13:48,050
(Sighs)

643
01:13:48,220 --> 01:13:51,550
Do it again. Do it again.
Just try once more.

644
01:13:54,600 --> 01:13:57,640
(Groaning)

645
01:13:57,770 --> 01:14:01,350
- (Panting)
- I'm sorry.

646
01:14:03,310 --> 01:14:07,150
When he pulls it out, put the gauze in.
There's gonna be a lot of blood.

647
01:14:12,910 --> 01:14:14,740
Put the gauze there.

648
01:14:24,750 --> 01:14:27,090
Fucker sprayed his bullet with Teflon.

649
01:14:28,420 --> 01:14:32,260
He was trying to stamp me "paid in full".

650
01:14:32,470 --> 01:14:35,220
- Is that why it went through the vest?
- Yeah.

651
01:14:37,010 --> 01:14:39,730
You think you can stitch me up
on your own?

652
01:14:41,140 --> 01:14:44,730
If you don't mind,
I'm gonna pass out.

653
01:15:08,960 --> 01:15:11,920
(Child Crying)

654
01:15:34,450 --> 01:15:36,870
You gonna kill me?

655
01:15:36,990 --> 01:15:40,870
No. I'm not gonna kill ya.

656
01:15:57,340 --> 01:15:59,430
(Beating Continues)

657
01:16:08,480 --> 01:16:10,320
Why would I want to kill ya?

658
01:16:15,280 --> 01:16:17,320
(Panting)

659
01:16:29,590 --> 01:16:32,500
- I gave you a job.
- I did my job.

660
01:16:33,710 --> 01:16:35,340
So how'd it go wrong?

661
01:16:35,470 --> 01:16:37,470
I thought you wanted the case.

662
01:16:38,720 --> 01:16:40,470
Oh, we'll get the case.

663
01:16:40,600 --> 01:16:43,640
We'll get the case, eh, Gregor?

664
01:16:45,390 --> 01:16:47,270
Don't you worry about the case.

665
01:16:49,770 --> 01:16:51,860
What I want is an explanation.

666
01:16:52,020 --> 01:16:54,690
An explanation? For what?

667
01:16:54,900 --> 01:16:56,820
You bollixed it up.

668
01:16:57,030 --> 01:16:59,950
- I bollixed it up?
- You hired him.

669
01:17:00,070 --> 01:17:01,950
Through your fucking contact!

670
01:17:08,080 --> 01:17:11,710
- You didn't do your homework.
- Why did you have to kill Larry?

671
01:17:11,840 --> 01:17:13,710
Oh, Larry, is it?

672
01:17:14,880 --> 01:17:16,720
I was clearing up your mess.

673
01:17:16,840 --> 01:17:19,720
My mess?
Oh, well, you take over, then.

674
01:17:19,890 --> 01:17:21,720
- Eh?
- But you can't, can you?

675
01:17:21,890 --> 01:17:24,010
It's you that's hiding, isn't it, Seamus?

676
01:17:24,180 --> 01:17:26,520
It's you that can't show your face.

677
01:17:29,230 --> 01:17:32,650
Who else thinks that?
Who you been talking to?

678
01:17:32,810 --> 01:17:34,980
Isn't that the reason
why I'm doing this job?

679
01:17:38,650 --> 01:17:40,490
You're a good girl, Deirdre.

680
01:17:41,910 --> 01:17:43,780
Do your job, eh?

681
01:17:57,550 --> 01:17:59,630
(French) He's tough, your Yank.

682
01:18:01,050 --> 01:18:02,640
You're right about that.

683
01:18:04,930 --> 01:18:06,140
But who is he?

684
01:18:07,890 --> 01:18:09,690
That's not important.

685
01:18:10,730 --> 01:18:13,440
Didn't he work for the CIA?

686
01:18:14,610 --> 01:18:16,360
He used to.

687
01:18:17,110 --> 01:18:18,570
Not anymore?

688
01:18:20,200 --> 01:18:21,820
He's on the run.

689
01:18:23,370 --> 01:18:24,830
You're sure?

690
01:18:24,950 --> 01:18:29,870
I know what he can do.
I've seen him.

691
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:32,460
Why would he carve himself up
if he were still CIA?

692
01:18:32,580 --> 01:18:35,170
He makes a call and it's taken care of.

693
01:18:45,760 --> 01:18:47,720
And you? How are you?

694
01:18:56,520 --> 01:19:01,990
We need some information.
We need to find some people in Paris.

695
01:19:02,110 --> 01:19:03,070
Who?

696
01:19:03,610 --> 01:19:06,280
An Irish man and woman,...

697
01:19:06,410 --> 01:19:08,620
...a German, an ex-KGB.

698
01:19:09,450 --> 01:19:10,540
They're professionals.

699
01:19:10,660 --> 01:19:12,120
They're in hiding.

700
01:19:12,830 --> 01:19:15,880
This is really important to you?

701
01:19:18,130 --> 01:19:20,630
He saved my life.

702
01:19:23,550 --> 01:19:24,380
Bon.

703
01:19:26,850 --> 01:19:29,390
I'll find them for you.

704
01:19:48,160 --> 01:19:50,910
Where's the case?

705
01:19:54,460 --> 01:19:56,290
It will come tomorrow. I'm sure.

706
01:19:56,500 --> 01:20:00,000
Well, I'm sure it will, too. Let's go.

707
01:20:01,130 --> 01:20:03,420
Let's hope so, for your sake, anyway.

708
01:20:35,120 --> 01:20:37,250
Are you feeling better?

709
01:20:37,420 --> 01:20:39,590
Yeah, enough to move around. Thanks.

710
01:20:49,550 --> 01:20:51,390
My hobby.

711
01:20:52,560 --> 01:20:54,390
One grows old.

712
01:20:56,190 --> 01:20:58,020
I knew a lot of fellas, friends of mine,...

713
01:20:58,190 --> 01:21:00,020
...they just wanted to live,
to open a bar.

714
01:21:00,150 --> 01:21:02,570
Had they lived,
would they have done it?

715
01:21:05,780 --> 01:21:08,910
- Then they were spared their disillusion.
- Yeah, that's right.

716
01:21:10,990 --> 01:21:13,120
Who were these people?
Friends of yours?

717
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:19,040
- I wouldn't hurt a friend.
- Was that my question?

718
01:21:20,580 --> 01:21:21,880
That's right.

719
01:21:27,420 --> 01:21:30,760
Well, who are you?

720
01:21:32,430 --> 01:21:35,890
A fella like you,
trying to make it to retirement.

721
01:21:36,060 --> 01:21:40,100
At the end of the day, we're likely
to be punished for our kindnesses.

722
01:21:40,230 --> 01:21:43,230
You don't have to worry about me.
I won't hurt you.

723
01:22:11,180 --> 01:22:13,430
The 47 ronin, do you know it?

724
01:22:15,470 --> 01:22:20,940
47 samurai whose master
was betrayed and killed by another lord.

725
01:22:21,060 --> 01:22:24,570
They became ronin,
master-less samurai,...

726
01:22:24,730 --> 01:22:26,900
...disgraced by another man's treachery.

727
01:22:28,400 --> 01:22:30,950
For three years they plotted,
pretending to be thieves,...

728
01:22:31,110 --> 01:22:33,780
...mercenaries, even madmen.

729
01:22:33,950 --> 01:22:36,290
That I didn't have time to do.

730
01:22:36,410 --> 01:22:38,790
And then one night they struck,
slipping into the castle...

731
01:22:38,950 --> 01:22:40,870
...of their lord's betrayer, killing him.

732
01:22:42,370 --> 01:22:44,790
Nice. I like that. My kind of job.

733
01:22:44,960 --> 01:22:46,880
There's something more.

734
01:22:48,510 --> 01:22:52,590
All 47 of them committed seppuku,...

735
01:22:52,760 --> 01:22:56,050
...ritual suicide,
in the courtyard of the castle.

736
01:22:56,220 --> 01:22:58,970
Well, that I don't like so much.

737
01:22:59,140 --> 01:23:02,230
- But you understand it?
- What do you mean, I understand it?

738
01:23:04,310 --> 01:23:08,940
The warrior code, the delight in the battle.
You understand that, yes?

739
01:23:10,240 --> 01:23:13,110
But also something more.

740
01:23:13,240 --> 01:23:15,620
You understand there is something
outside yourself...

741
01:23:15,740 --> 01:23:18,080
...that has to be served.

742
01:23:18,240 --> 01:23:20,450
And when that need is gone,...

743
01:23:20,620 --> 01:23:24,000
...when belief has died, what are you?

744
01:23:24,120 --> 01:23:26,080
A man without a master.

745
01:23:26,290 --> 01:23:29,090
Right now I'm a man
without a pay cheque.

746
01:23:29,250 --> 01:23:32,970
The ronin could have hired
themselves to new masters.

747
01:23:33,090 --> 01:23:35,220
They could have fought
for themselves.

748
01:23:35,390 --> 01:23:38,350
But they chose honor.
They chose myth.

749
01:23:39,560 --> 01:23:41,350
They chose wrong.

750
01:23:49,190 --> 01:23:51,690
Seppu... Seppu... what?

751
01:23:51,860 --> 01:23:54,030
Yes, seppuku.

752
01:23:54,150 --> 01:23:56,370
Disembowelment.

753
01:23:56,530 --> 01:23:59,240
The sword goes in here.

754
01:23:59,370 --> 01:24:01,620
(Slicing Sound)

755
01:24:09,380 --> 01:24:11,380
[Sam] Are you sure
this address is good?

756
01:24:11,550 --> 01:24:13,420
[Vincent] Jean-Pierre gave it to me.

757
01:24:46,920 --> 01:24:50,380
Under the bridge by the river...

758
01:24:50,500 --> 01:24:53,170
How did you know
it was an ambush?

759
01:24:53,300 --> 01:24:55,720
Whenever there is any doubt,
there is no doubt.

760
01:24:55,880 --> 01:24:57,720
That's the first thing
they teach you.

761
01:25:01,510 --> 01:25:04,180
Who taught you?

762
01:25:04,350 --> 01:25:07,480
I don't remember.
That's the second thing they teach you.

763
01:25:12,690 --> 01:25:14,940
All good things
come to those who wait.

764
01:25:45,770 --> 01:25:49,350
- Why is Gregor still alive?
- He's taking them to the package.

765
01:26:13,960 --> 01:26:15,130
How ya doing?

766
01:26:23,010 --> 01:26:25,720
What are you...
What are you gonna do to me?

767
01:26:25,890 --> 01:26:31,100
Let's just be calm for one more moment.
One more moment.

768
01:26:43,820 --> 01:26:45,870
Why? Why?

769
01:26:45,990 --> 01:26:48,040
You know why.

770
01:26:48,160 --> 01:26:50,290
No. You don't wanna do that.

771
01:26:54,130 --> 01:26:55,090
You can't.

772
01:27:00,050 --> 01:27:00,670
Get back!

773
01:27:02,300 --> 01:27:04,260
Get in the fucking car!

774
01:27:14,230 --> 01:27:15,770
Why didn't you shoot her?

775
01:28:07,990 --> 01:28:09,700
Take the tunnel, now!

776
01:28:09,830 --> 01:28:11,790
[Deirdre] Oh, Christ!

777
01:28:14,120 --> 01:28:16,210
Eh, merde!

778
01:28:47,870 --> 01:28:49,830
(Siren)

779
01:29:33,120 --> 01:29:35,620
(Horns Honking)

780
01:30:11,110 --> 01:30:13,120
(Tyres Screeching)

781
01:31:10,550 --> 01:31:14,050
(Horns Honking)

782
01:31:24,730 --> 01:31:26,060
Come on! Come on!

783
01:31:51,220 --> 01:31:53,130
All right, you fuck!

784
01:33:46,710 --> 01:33:48,710
(Deirdre Screaming)

785
01:34:00,590 --> 01:34:03,430
(Coughing)

786
01:34:14,480 --> 01:34:16,990
(Gunfire)

787
01:34:21,530 --> 01:34:23,740
(Shouting In French)

788
01:34:34,920 --> 01:34:37,170
(Groaning)

789
01:35:20,170 --> 01:35:22,510
[Vincent] Where could he be?

790
01:35:22,630 --> 01:35:26,560
- Where could he be?
- Hmm.

791
01:35:26,720 --> 01:35:30,140
The Irish and the Russians are looking
for him. So where does he go?

792
01:35:30,270 --> 01:35:34,100
He goes to the Russians
to make the deal for the case.

793
01:35:34,230 --> 01:35:37,690
Gregor ain't coming in unless
he can figure out a safe exchange.

794
01:35:37,860 --> 01:35:39,990
He knows they'll kill him for the case
rather than pay him for it.

795
01:35:40,110 --> 01:35:45,450
He's got to work it out soon
before the Irish find him.

796
01:35:46,830 --> 01:35:48,620
So where does he go?

797
01:35:50,500 --> 01:35:52,330
You go to what you know.

798
01:35:55,920 --> 01:35:59,710
He's KGB.
He goes to one of his old safe houses.

799
01:36:01,220 --> 01:36:03,800
No, they're all blown.

800
01:36:03,970 --> 01:36:06,300
Where does he go?

801
01:36:06,470 --> 01:36:08,470
(Sighs)

802
01:36:12,100 --> 01:36:15,480
So, you're on the run.
Where do you go?

803
01:36:15,650 --> 01:36:17,520
Hmm?

804
01:36:21,690 --> 01:36:26,070
Where's he been? Where's he been?
Where's he been? Where's he been?

805
01:36:26,240 --> 01:36:28,830
(Chattering In French)

806
01:36:37,880 --> 01:36:40,420
He made the fake case.

807
01:36:40,550 --> 01:36:42,880
He had the fake case made.

808
01:36:43,050 --> 01:36:46,470
Gregor. He had it made.

809
01:36:46,590 --> 01:36:49,140
He had to have had it made.

810
01:36:50,680 --> 01:36:53,770
In Paris, before we went to Nice.

811
01:36:53,890 --> 01:36:55,690
He didn't have time to have it made.

812
01:36:55,810 --> 01:36:57,980
He bought something that looked like it,
then spray-painted it.

813
01:36:58,110 --> 01:37:00,650
Where did he get the spray?
He never left the room.

814
01:37:00,770 --> 01:37:02,730
Where did he get the case?

815
01:37:12,410 --> 01:37:14,620
[Vincent] Excusez-moi, monsieur.

816
01:37:35,980 --> 01:37:37,770
It's a case for ice skates.

817
01:37:41,400 --> 01:37:43,280
Why ice skates?

818
01:37:45,610 --> 01:37:47,570
And why would Gregor
know an ice-skate case?

819
01:37:49,620 --> 01:37:52,080
He didn't have time to have it made.

820
01:37:52,240 --> 01:37:57,000
He didn't have time to have it made.
The Russians made it.

821
01:37:59,000 --> 01:38:01,540
The Russians made it.

822
01:38:04,710 --> 01:38:06,550
We're following the wrong people.

823
01:38:06,720 --> 01:38:09,590
We don't have to find Gregor.

824
01:38:09,760 --> 01:38:12,430
We find the Russians,
they will take us to him.

825
01:38:12,600 --> 01:38:16,430
(Russian) You've lived in Paris
a long time. You know the people.

826
01:38:16,560 --> 01:38:19,560
- I get around.
- You meet the new Russians.

827
01:38:19,690 --> 01:38:23,570
You know how it is.
Ex-spies. Now it's Mafia.

828
01:38:24,480 --> 01:38:26,570
Under diplomatic cover.

829
01:38:28,150 --> 01:38:29,110
KGB?

830
01:38:29,400 --> 01:38:30,360
Ex-KGB.

831
01:38:30,820 --> 01:38:35,370
(French) Heavy hitters, gamblers,
lots of money, big cars.

832
01:38:35,490 --> 01:38:36,870
(Russian) They live like Tsars.
Throw money away.

833
01:38:37,000 --> 01:38:38,830
Fur hats are expensive.

834
01:38:38,960 --> 01:38:44,340
- And bodyguards.
- Expensive coats, Dr Zhivago.

835
01:38:44,460 --> 01:38:47,590
I have a lot of work, no time.

836
01:38:49,130 --> 01:38:50,720
I understand.

837
01:38:52,510 --> 01:38:54,180
All right. Let's go.

838
01:38:55,140 --> 01:38:56,100
Okay.

839
01:39:03,310 --> 01:39:04,860
(French) It will be fine.

840
01:39:06,400 --> 01:39:08,240
The guy is gonna reach out.

841
01:39:08,360 --> 01:39:10,240
Is he any good?

842
01:39:10,400 --> 01:39:13,240
Jean-Pierre says if it's Russian
and it's in Paris...

843
01:39:13,370 --> 01:39:15,370
(Speaking Russian)

844
01:39:24,380 --> 01:39:27,750
(French) If I wanted to find Russians
in Paris this week,...

845
01:39:27,880 --> 01:39:32,010
...I'd go to the ice show.

846
01:39:40,930 --> 01:39:44,350
(Crowd Chattering)

847
01:39:44,520 --> 01:39:47,360
(Applause, Cheering)

848
01:40:46,080 --> 01:40:48,170
- Bonsoir, Pierre.
- Bonsoir.

849
01:40:48,290 --> 01:40:50,170
Je vais payer pour votre soeur.

850
01:40:50,300 --> 01:40:53,630
Oh, merci beaucoup,
Mademoiselle Kirilova.

851
01:41:00,180 --> 01:41:04,890
(French)
I'll trade you a cigarette for a favor.

852
01:41:05,480 --> 01:41:07,350
The favor is, steer clear of those guys.

853
01:41:07,480 --> 01:41:08,940
Who? The Russians?

854
01:41:15,490 --> 01:41:17,660
They sure throw their money around.

855
01:41:18,820 --> 01:41:19,870
Bonsoir.

856
01:41:19,990 --> 01:41:22,160
- Ca va?
- Salut.

857
01:41:25,500 --> 01:41:27,330
- Bonsoir.
- Ah, bonsoir.

858
01:41:33,920 --> 01:41:38,220
The Russian is seeing Natacha Kirilova,
the star of the ice show.

859
01:41:38,340 --> 01:41:41,890
He spends every evening in the audience.

860
01:41:43,180 --> 01:41:44,640
How did you find that out?

861
01:41:44,770 --> 01:41:48,020
We went to high school together.

862
01:41:48,150 --> 01:41:49,100
(Clapping)

863
01:42:22,300 --> 01:42:24,720
(Russian) Mikhi, is everything all right?

864
01:42:25,560 --> 01:42:26,930
Everything is fine.

865
01:42:28,190 --> 01:42:29,190
Sweet girl.

866
01:42:32,020 --> 01:42:32,980
Go. Go on.

867
01:42:38,200 --> 01:42:40,990
(Applause, Cheering)

868
01:42:52,000 --> 01:42:53,710
(PA System In French)
Ladies and gentlemen!

869
01:42:53,840 --> 01:42:57,090
We are very proud to present...

870
01:42:57,210 --> 01:43:04,050
...two-time Olympic champion
and three-time World champion,...

871
01:43:04,180 --> 01:43:07,770
...Natacha Kirilova!

872
01:43:17,110 --> 01:43:23,530
(Applause Fades)

873
01:44:18,380 --> 01:44:21,340
(Applause, Whistling)

874
01:44:40,610 --> 01:44:43,450
(Applause)

875
01:45:14,100 --> 01:45:15,980
Let's go.

876
01:45:29,370 --> 01:45:31,450
(Russian) Wait out here.

877
01:45:36,460 --> 01:45:38,670
Yes, he is.

878
01:45:38,790 --> 01:45:40,840
Hello, Mikhi.

879
01:45:41,000 --> 01:45:44,970
- The meeting is not till later tonight.
- The meeting's now.

880
01:45:45,170 --> 01:45:48,220
(Crowd Applauding)

881
01:45:48,390 --> 01:45:49,930
You have the money?

882
01:45:51,310 --> 01:45:55,180
Well, we were going to go back
to get it before the meet.

883
01:45:55,310 --> 01:45:56,390
I don't think so.

884
01:45:57,900 --> 01:45:59,770
You have the money?

885
01:46:04,230 --> 01:46:07,200
I might have the money.
Where is the case?

886
01:46:07,320 --> 01:46:11,660
No, you have to do it.
I couldn't live with myself.

887
01:46:24,670 --> 01:46:26,510
I have the money.

888
01:46:26,670 --> 01:46:29,130
We conclude this now
and part friends.

889
01:46:29,260 --> 01:46:31,010
Okay?

890
01:46:33,930 --> 01:46:34,970
Where is the case?

891
01:46:47,400 --> 01:46:49,240
I'd like to be paid now.

892
01:46:54,870 --> 01:46:57,000
No doubt.

893
01:47:01,790 --> 01:47:03,630
Now tell me the other part.

894
01:47:05,130 --> 01:47:07,260
The other part?

895
01:47:07,420 --> 01:47:09,260
I'm leaving.

896
01:47:09,420 --> 01:47:12,260
I'm taking my fee and I'm leaving.

897
01:47:13,930 --> 01:47:16,970
I have a person with a rifle in the stadium.

898
01:47:17,220 --> 01:47:20,020
I've worked with her for years.
She never misses.

899
01:47:20,190 --> 01:47:23,110
I will call.

900
01:47:23,270 --> 01:47:25,570
I have to call within 45 seconds...

901
01:47:25,730 --> 01:47:27,780
...to say that I'm leaving,...

902
01:47:27,940 --> 01:47:31,070
...and then in another 10 minutes
to say that I'm safe.

903
01:47:32,780 --> 01:47:36,660
Should I be unable to call,
your friend will be shot.

904
01:47:46,550 --> 01:47:48,380
30 seconds, Mikhi.

905
01:47:49,840 --> 01:47:52,300
- (French) We need to get inside.
- You can't pass without badges.

906
01:47:59,680 --> 01:48:01,480
20 seconds.

907
01:48:12,200 --> 01:48:13,160
10 seconds.

908
01:48:28,800 --> 01:48:29,340
(Gunshot)

909
01:48:42,430 --> 01:48:45,270
(French) There were two of them.

910
01:48:45,400 --> 01:48:47,060
They were looking for those guys.

911
01:48:47,190 --> 01:48:49,320
Just a minute, sir!

912
01:48:49,480 --> 01:48:51,360
(Camera Shutters Clicking)

913
01:49:05,920 --> 01:49:09,800
(French) I am a Chilean citizen,
as you can see from my passport.

914
01:49:09,920 --> 01:49:11,550
Merci.

915
01:49:14,010 --> 01:49:16,340
(Chattering, Shouting)

916
01:49:50,040 --> 01:49:53,170
- Mama!
- Shh, shh, shh.

917
01:49:59,050 --> 01:50:00,640
Katchev!

918
01:50:00,760 --> 01:50:01,890
Qu'est-ce qui se passe?

919
01:50:04,640 --> 01:50:07,310
(Screaming)

920
01:50:16,950 --> 01:50:17,910
Stay with him.

921
01:50:50,810 --> 01:50:53,320
Get out of here.
Get out of here!

922
01:50:53,480 --> 01:50:56,280
Get out of the car.
Walk away. Walk away!

923
01:50:56,400 --> 01:50:59,200
Walk away! Go. Go.

924
01:50:59,320 --> 01:51:02,160
- I will if you will.
- Just go.

925
01:51:02,280 --> 01:51:04,700
Come with me.
Forget about the case.

926
01:51:09,160 --> 01:51:11,630
I didn't come for the case.
I came for your boss.

927
01:51:13,500 --> 01:51:16,050
I came for Seamus. I came for him.

928
01:51:17,460 --> 01:51:22,340
Just get out of here.
I never left. Don't you see?

929
01:51:23,760 --> 01:51:26,060
Get out of the way!
Get out of the way!

930
01:51:29,430 --> 01:51:31,060
(Sirens)

931
01:51:34,440 --> 01:51:35,730
Get out of the way!

932
01:51:35,860 --> 01:51:37,150
(French) This way is blocked.

933
01:52:05,010 --> 01:52:06,850
I can take you in or leave you here.

934
01:52:08,390 --> 01:52:09,600
There. That's him with the case.

935
01:52:09,730 --> 01:52:11,810
(French) Sir! Over here, please.

936
01:52:11,940 --> 01:52:12,640
Wait! Wait!

937
01:52:13,770 --> 01:52:15,480
(Screaming, Shouting)

938
01:52:20,320 --> 01:52:23,320
(French) There are more back there!

939
01:52:54,730 --> 01:52:57,150
(Panting)

940
01:53:00,650 --> 01:53:02,490
[Seamus] Stay where you are!
Stay where you are!

941
01:53:02,610 --> 01:53:06,450
Don't move! Shut your fucking mouth up!
Shut your mouth!

942
01:53:13,290 --> 01:53:17,330
(Gasping, Sobbing)

943
01:53:20,500 --> 01:53:22,300
You stupid shite.

944
01:53:22,510 --> 01:53:26,010
- You're a dead man.
- (Gunfire)

945
01:53:48,570 --> 01:53:50,910
(Radio)
This is the BBC World Service.

946
01:53:51,080 --> 01:53:53,750
It was announced today,
after almost 30 years...

947
01:53:53,870 --> 01:53:57,210
...of bloody and seemingly intractable
civil conflict in Northern Ireland,...

948
01:53:57,330 --> 01:53:59,210
...that a peace agreement
has been reached between...

949
01:53:59,380 --> 01:54:02,550
...the predominantly Protestant
government of that British-ruled enclave,...

950
01:54:02,710 --> 01:54:05,220
- ...and the Irish resistance...
- (Overlapping Radio Reports)

951
01:54:10,050 --> 01:54:13,600
...have told CNN that it was
the apprehension and slaying...

952
01:54:13,770 --> 01:54:18,560
...in France of the Irish terrorist Seamus
O'Rourke, by parties still unknown,...

953
01:54:18,690 --> 01:54:20,980
...that contributed a stability,
largely allowing...

954
01:54:21,110 --> 01:54:25,070
...the negotiations to proceed
to their historic conclusion today.

955
01:54:25,240 --> 01:54:28,110
O'Rourke had earlier
been denounced by the IRA,...

956
01:54:28,280 --> 01:54:32,330
...the military wing of Sinn Fein,
as a rogue breakaway operative.

957
01:54:34,870 --> 01:54:38,170
Well, then, good knowing ya.

958
01:54:48,930 --> 01:54:49,890
Hmm?

959
01:54:50,010 --> 01:54:53,180
- I'm sorry?
- You said something.

960
01:54:53,310 --> 01:54:56,770
I said she would not
be coming back here.

961
01:54:58,980 --> 01:55:03,400
Yeah. She would
not be coming back here, would she?

962
01:55:09,700 --> 01:55:11,740
I can't even put my hand in my pocket
to pay the bill.

963
01:55:11,870 --> 01:55:13,990
I'll get it.

964
01:55:16,540 --> 01:55:18,330
I'll get the next one.

965
01:55:24,710 --> 01:55:26,420
What was in the case?

966
01:55:26,670 --> 01:55:28,670
I don't remember.

967
01:55:30,050 --> 01:55:31,550
Lesson number two.

968
01:55:33,760 --> 01:55:35,600
Keep in touch.

969
01:55:54,160 --> 01:55:55,950
Let's go.

970
01:56:09,210 --> 01:56:11,970
[Vincent]
No questions, no answers.

971
01:56:12,090 --> 01:56:14,180
That's the business we're in.

972
01:56:14,300 --> 01:56:16,560
You accept it and move on.

973
01:56:18,020 --> 01:56:20,770
Maybe that's lesson number three.
