Brenda! Brenda.

1199
01:36:09,560 --> 01:36:12,848
- Brenda, talk to me.
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1200
01:36:13,000 --> 01:36:14,206
What's going on with her?

1201
01:36:14,360 --> 01:36:16,522
I don't know. Brenda, are you all right?

1202
01:36:16,680 --> 01:36:19,045
- Brenda? Talk to me.
- What the hell?

1203
01:36:19,960 --> 01:36:20,722
Shit!

1204
01:36:20,920 --> 01:36:22,126
- Crank! We got a Crank!
- No!

1205
01:36:22,280 --> 01:36:23,770
- No!
- Wait, wait!

1206
01:36:23,960 --> 01:36:25,530
- Step back!
- Listen, okay?

1207
01:36:25,680 --> 01:36:27,523
This just happened, okay?
She's not dangerous yet.

1208
01:36:27,680 --> 01:36:29,882
- You shouldn't have brought her here!
- I know.

1209
01:36:30,200 --> 01:36:32,123
We let Cranks in here now,
the safe haven doesn't last a week!

1210
01:36:32,280 --> 01:36:35,571
- Step back!
- I understand, okay? I understand.

1211
01:36:35,720 --> 01:36:39,202
Just listen. Please. Please, okay?
I told her that you could help.

1212
01:36:40,080 --> 01:36:41,764
Okay? No.

1213
01:36:42,200 --> 01:36:43,964
There's got to be something you can do.

1214
01:36:46,720 --> 01:36:49,326
Yeah, there is.

1215
01:36:53,640 --> 01:36:56,128

There's nothing we can do for her.

1220
01:37:11,320 --> 01:37:12,810
Hello, Thomas.

1221
01:37:15,240 --> 01:37:16,287
What?

1222
01:37:18,240 --> 01:37:19,924
You know me?

1223
01:37:21,280 --> 01:37:22,441
Interesting.

1224
01:37:24,240 --> 01:37:26,641
It makes sense
they'd put you in the maze.

1225
01:37:27,760 --> 01:37:29,330
Though I must admit...

1226
01:37:29,800 --> 01:37:32,485
I was worried they'd kill you
after what you did.

1227
01:37:34,440 --> 01:37:35,805
What I did?

1228
01:37:38,800 --> 01:37:42,600
The first time we spoke,
you said you couldn't take it anymore...

1229
01:37:43,200 --> 01:37:45,521
watching your friends die, one by one.

1230
01:37:47,120 --> 01:37:48,849
The last time we spoke...

1231
01:37:49,000 --> 01:37:52,800
you gave me the coordinates
of every WICKED compound, trial and lab.

1232
01:37:55,200 --> 01:37:56,964
He was our source.

1233
01:37:58,440 --> 01:38:00,886
We couldn't have pulled
all this off without him.

1234
01:38:02,480 --> 01:38:03,845
Take her to the tent.

1235
01:38:04,480 --> 01:38:06,482
Get these guys some warm clothes.

1236
01:38:07,680 --> 01:38:10,165
- Careful.
- Come on.

1237
01:38:14,680 --> 01:38:17,206
Hey, it's the least we can do.

1238
01:38:17,840 --> 01:38:19,808
Thomas, come on.

1239
01:38:21,480 --> 01:38:23,323
I need to get some blood from you.

1240
01:38:30,320 --> 01:38:32,926
In the beginning, we were lost.

1241
01:38:33,880 --> 01:38:36,167
All we knew for sure...

1242
01:38:36,320 --> 01:38:39,722
was that the younger you were,
the stronger your chances.

1243
01:38:40,560 --> 01:38:42,210
You worked for WICKED?

1244
01:38:44,560 --> 01:38:46,688
Long time ago.

1245
01:38:47,440 --> 01:38:49,681
You know, at first,
we had the best intentions.

1246
01:38:50,360 --> 01:38:52,681
Find a cure, save the world.

1247
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:57,686
It was clear you kids were the key,
because you were immune.

1248
01:38:58,520 --> 01:38:59,851
But why?

1249
01:39:00,240 --> 01:39:02,288
Eventually, we found an answer.

1250
01:39:02,840 --> 01:39:05,525
An enzyme produced
by the brains of the immune.

1251
01:39:05,680 --> 01:39:07,091
Once separated from the bloodstream...

1252
01:39:07,240 --> 01:39:10,687
it can serve as a powerful agent
to slow the spread of the virus.

1253
01:39:11,720 --> 01:39:13,927
So, you found a cure?

1254
01:39:14,440 --> 01:39:15,805
Not exactly.

1255
01:39:17,240 --> 01:39:21,609
The enzyme can't be manufactured,
only harvested from the immune.

1256
01:39:22,360 --> 01:39:23,600
The young.

1257
01:39:25,360 --> 01:39:27,727
Of course, that didn't stop WICKED.

1258
01:39:27,880 --> 01:39:28,927
If they had their way...

1259
01:39:29,080 --> 01:39:31,970
they'd sacrifice an entire generation.

1260
01:39:32,120 --> 01:39:34,805
All for this.

1261
01:39:35,920 --> 01:39:37,251
A gift of biology.

1262
01:39:37,400 --> 01:39:39,084
Of evolution.

1263
01:39:40,880 --> 01:39:43,087
But one not meant for all of us.

A few months maybe.

1268
01:40:06,240 --> 01:40:08,242
But that's the catch, isn't it?

1269
01:40:09,320 --> 01:40:10,845
She'll always need more.

1270
01:40:12,760 --> 01:40:13,966
Okay.

1271

She'll be fine.

1275
01:40:33,560 --> 01:40:36,564
You know she can't come with us, right?

1276
01:41:34,320 --> 01:41:35,890
He was my brother.

1277
01:41:37,520 --> 01:41:39,568
Hey. Sorry.

1278
01:41:39,720 --> 01:41:41,722
Are you okay? How are you feeling?

1279
01:41:45,360 --> 01:41:47,488
You remind me of him.

1281

Where is he now?

1282
01:42:03,520 --> 01:42:05,249
I don't know.

1283
01:42:07,040 --> 01:42:09,168
When we were kids...

1284
01:42:09,320 --> 01:42:12,085
we were taken in
by one of WICKED's camps.

1285
01:42:15,440 --> 01:42:17,568
They gave us a bunch of tests.

1286
01:42:19,240 --> 01:42:21,049
They didn't want me.

1287
01:42:23,600 --> 01:42:25,250
They wanted him, though.

1288
01:42:31,080 --> 01:42:34,163
They didn't even let me say good-bye.

1289
01:42:40,840 --> 01:42:42,524
What was his name?

1290
01:42:46,520 --> 01:42:48,249

1319
01:46:00,920 --> 01:46:02,570
I remember mine.

1320
01:46:05,120 --> 01:46:07,122
She was a beautiful woman.

1321
01:46:07,880 --> 01:46:09,609
Everybody loved her.

1322
01:46:11,200 --> 01:46:13,441
And before WICKED, she was all I had.

1323
01:46:18,400 --> 01:46:22,689
When she got sick,
I didn't know what to do.

1324
01:46:24,480 --> 01:46:27,324
I just kept her locked up. Hidden.

1325
01:46:28,680 --> 01:46:30,523
I thought she'd get better.

1326
01:46:32,960 --> 01:46:37,807
Every night, she'd make
these awful sounds, like screaming.

1327
01:46:38,840 --> 01:46:42,322
And then, one night, she just stopped.

1328
01:46:43,760 --> 01:46:45,330
She was finally quiet.

1329
01:46:48,240 --> 01:46:50,004
I went down to her room.

1330
01:46:52,800 --> 01:46:54,564
And there was blood everywhere.

1331
01:46:55,960 --> 01:46:58,122
But she was just sat there, calm.

1332
01:46:59,360 --> 01:47:00,850
She said she was feeling better.

1333
01:47:01,840 --> 01:47:04,491

02:03:39,320 --> 02:03:41,402
I'd like some revenge.

1544
02:03:50,720 --> 02:03:52,404
So, what's your plan?
