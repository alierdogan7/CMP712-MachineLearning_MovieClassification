1
00:03:00,625 --> 00:03:02,491
Come, come.

2
00:03:08,102 --> 00:03:11,038
You have authorization
to dress him like that?

3
00:03:11,106 --> 00:03:12,870
Oh, yes, sir.

4
00:03:14,010 --> 00:03:15,876
Circus ape, huh?

5
00:03:15,946 --> 00:03:19,145
The only one ever to have been
trained as a bareback rider

6
00:03:19,392 --> 00:03:21,326
in the entire history of the circus.

7
00:03:21,394 --> 00:03:23,329
Circuses are past history .

8
00:03:23,397 --> 00:03:25,593
Not while I live and breathe.

9
00:03:25,667 --> 00:03:27,636
Go ahead, Senor Armando.

10
00:03:27,703 --> 00:03:29,638
Thank you.
Come, come.

11
00:03:44,928 --> 00:03:46,658
Come, come.

12
00:03:54,374 --> 00:03:57,310
- Did I do all right?
- Yes, yes, yes.

13
00:03:57,378 --> 00:03:59,870
But walk more like
a primitive chimpanzee.

14
00:03:59,949 --> 00:04:04,183
Your arms should move
from the shoulder, like so.

15
00:04:05,656 --> 00:04:07,682
Yes, that's better.

16
00:04:07,759 --> 00:04:12,027
After 20 years,
you've picked up evolved habits from me.

17
00:04:12,099 --> 00:04:14,933
That could be dangerous.
Even fatal.

18
00:04:15,003 --> 00:04:16,938
Armando, I don't understand.

19
00:04:17,006 --> 00:04:21,536
Caesar, there can be only one
talking chimpanzee on Earth,

20
00:04:21,613 --> 00:04:24,742
the child of the two talking apes,
Cornelius and Zira,

21
00:04:24,817 --> 00:04:28,585
who came from the future
and were brutally murdered

22
00:04:28,656 --> 00:04:32,423
for fear that one very distant day
apes might dominate the human race.

23
00:04:32,494 --> 00:04:36,455
But outside of you,
nobody even knows I exist.

24
00:04:36,533 --> 00:04:39,264
We must keep it that way.

25
00:04:39,337 --> 00:04:43,105
The mere fact of your existence would be
regarded as a great threat to mankind.

26
00:04:43,176 --> 00:04:44,575
- I--
- Shh!

27
00:04:44,645 --> 00:04:47,274
Come, come.

28
00:05:03,038 --> 00:05:03,605
Attention.
This is the watch commander.

29
00:05:03,605 --> 00:05:06,268
Attention.
This is the watch commander.

30
00:05:06,342 --> 00:05:09,710
Disperse apes gathering in the mall.

31
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:13,274
Repeat. Disperse apes
gathering in the mall.

32
00:05:13,352 --> 00:05:17,723
Take the serial number of each offender
and notify Ape Control immediately.

33
00:05:17,792 --> 00:05:19,350
Repeat.

34
00:05:19,427 --> 00:05:23,559
Take these rial number of each offender
and notify Ape Control immediately.

35
00:05:23,633 --> 00:05:26,569
Their masters
are to be cited and fined.

36
00:05:26,637 --> 00:05:28,071
Repeat.

37
00:05:28,139 --> 00:05:32,042
Their masters
are to be cited and fined.

38
00:06:19,177 --> 00:06:22,148
Attention, attention.
This is the watch commander.

39
00:06:22,215 --> 00:06:24,149
Attention, attention.

40
00:06:24,218 --> 00:06:28,121
Disperse unauthorized
ape gathering at ramp six.

41
00:06:28,190 --> 00:06:31,524
Repeat, disperse
unauthorized ape gathering

42
00:06:31,595 --> 00:06:33,529
at the foot of ramp six.

43
00:06:33,597 --> 00:06:36,864
No citation or fine
in this instance.

44
00:06:36,936 --> 00:06:39,098
Repeat.
No citation or fine.

45
00:06:39,173 --> 00:06:41,368
But how did it happen?

46
00:06:41,442 --> 00:06:42,876
Shh.

47
00:06:48,953 --> 00:06:50,887
Go!

48
00:06:50,955 --> 00:06:52,924
Go!

49
00:06:52,991 --> 00:06:54,186
No!

50
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:55,591
No!

51
00:06:55,662 --> 00:06:57,028
Aah!

52
00:07:04,908 --> 00:07:07,207
Go.
You go.

53
00:07:11,952 --> 00:07:15,184
But you said humans
treated apes like pets.

54
00:07:16,592 --> 00:07:18,527
They did, in the beginning.

55
00:07:18,595 --> 00:07:20,996
- They've made slaves of them.
- Shh!

56
00:07:29,009 --> 00:07:33,448
They all died eight years ago,
every dog and cat in the world.

57
00:07:33,516 --> 00:07:35,450
It was like a plague.

58
00:07:35,518 --> 00:07:38,455
The disease that killed them
was a mysterious virus

59
00:07:38,523 --> 00:07:40,992
brought back from outer space
by one of the astronauts.

60
00:07:41,059 --> 00:07:43,995
- Didn't the disease affect humans?
- No, no, we were immune.

61
00:07:44,063 --> 00:07:45,998
And so were simians,
even the smallest.

62
00:07:46,066 --> 00:07:48,000
That's how it began--

63
00:07:48,069 --> 00:07:52,234
humans wanting little pets
to replace those they'd lost.

64
00:07:52,308 --> 00:07:56,076
When people realized
how quick they were to learn,

65
00:07:56,147 --> 00:07:58,082
how easy to train,

66
00:07:58,150 --> 00:08:02,087
the pets became larger and larger

67
00:08:02,155 --> 00:08:04,716
until now...

68
00:08:04,792 --> 00:08:06,954
It's monstrous.

69
00:08:10,033 --> 00:08:14,028
Now you understand
why I've kept you away.

70
00:08:14,105 --> 00:08:16,074
Yes, Lisa.

71
00:08:16,142 --> 00:08:20,604
A Young Queen Falls
for Mrs. Riley.

72
00:08:35,035 --> 00:08:36,627
No!

73
00:08:43,213 --> 00:08:45,148
Lisa.

74
00:08:46,718 --> 00:08:48,152
Yes?

75
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:53,182
Could you be so kind
as to display it in your window?

76
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:55,525
- When I have the time.
- Thank you.

77
00:09:00,571 --> 00:09:01,932
Attention.

78
00:09:02,066 --> 00:09:04,696
The labor demonstration
on the south plaza

79
00:09:04,771 --> 00:09:07,570
will be terminated in 10 minutes.

80
00:09:07,641 --> 00:09:09,074
Repeat.

81
00:09:09,143 --> 00:09:11,578
The labor demonstration
on the south plaza

82
00:09:11,646 --> 00:09:14,583
will be terminated in 10minutes.

83
00:09:22,328 --> 00:09:24,559
Thank you, Frank.

84
00:09:26,133 --> 00:09:30,071
Now that I know
they won't kill me,

85
00:09:30,139 --> 00:09:32,074
I don't enjoy them.

86
00:09:34,379 --> 00:09:37,406
Well, for heaven's sakes, a circus.

87
00:09:37,483 --> 00:09:40,078
[Growling, Snarling]

88
00:10:10,729 --> 00:10:12,664
Home, Lisa.

89
00:10:24,983 --> 00:10:26,212
Yes?

90
00:10:26,285 --> 00:10:27,809
Oh, I was wondering,

91
00:10:27,887 --> 00:10:31,222
would you be kind enough
to display these posters?

92
00:10:32,794 --> 00:10:34,228
Stop it!

93
00:10:34,296 --> 00:10:35,661
No, Zelda.

94
00:10:35,731 --> 00:10:37,632
Home, Zelda.

95
00:10:39,036 --> 00:10:40,663
I'm sorry , Mrs. Riley.

96
00:10:40,738 --> 00:10:42,673
I'll comb you out in a minute.

97
00:10:42,741 --> 00:10:45,302
I want to be combed out now.
I have to go to a luncheon.

98
00:10:45,378 --> 00:10:46,607
Thursday, then.

99
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:48,273
Thursday.

100
00:10:48,349 --> 00:10:50,784
Oh, I'm out of raisins.

101
00:10:50,853 --> 00:10:52,787
- Take mine.
- Thank you.

102
00:10:52,855 --> 00:10:56,793
Why stir 'em into something like that?
The pigment is in synthetic alloy.

103
00:10:56,861 --> 00:10:58,887
You're over tipping.

104
00:10:58,964 --> 00:11:00,295
Yeah, but it'll come back.

105
00:11:00,365 --> 00:11:01,298
[Crash]

106
00:11:01,367 --> 00:11:02,766
No!

107
00:11:02,836 --> 00:11:04,236
No, no!

108
00:11:05,774 --> 00:11:08,175
I told them to condition them to fire.

109
00:11:13,318 --> 00:11:14,979
Attention, attention.

110
00:11:15,053 --> 00:11:17,956
The labor demonstration
on the south plaza

111
00:11:18,024 --> 00:11:20,721
will be terminated in five minutes.

112
00:11:20,795 --> 00:11:23,856
The labor demonstration
will be terminated

113
00:11:23,932 --> 00:11:25,525
in five minutes.

114
00:11:25,602 --> 00:11:28,299
Failure to comply with this order

115
00:11:28,372 --> 00:11:32,936
can result in a one-year suspension
of your right to bargain collectively.

116
00:11:33,012 --> 00:11:34,445
What's his job?

117
00:11:34,513 --> 00:11:36,379
He's a messenger.

118
00:11:36,450 --> 00:11:38,510
For the governor, so get!

119
00:11:38,586 --> 00:11:40,680
Hyah! Get!

120
00:11:40,756 --> 00:11:42,223
Go! Go!

121
00:11:42,291 --> 00:11:43,850
Otto, no!

122
00:11:43,927 --> 00:11:46,055
Otto, no, no.

123
00:11:46,130 --> 00:11:48,190
- [Groaning]
- Otto, no, no.

124
00:11:48,267 --> 00:11:50,600
- Otto, no.
- [Groaning Continues]

125
00:11:50,670 --> 00:11:53,071
Stop this at once, all of you!

126
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:55,075
Mr. MacDonald, we were just--

127
00:11:55,143 --> 00:11:59,137
I saw what you were doing. Sedate
the animal and get him out of here.

128
00:11:59,215 --> 00:12:00,478
Who's that?

129
00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:02,644
MacDonald, the governor's
number-one assistant.

130
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,916
He love apes or something?

131
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:06,958
Don't it figure?

132
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:10,928
Hold him, Bill.

133
00:12:10,998 --> 00:12:12,557
Aah!

134
00:12:12,634 --> 00:12:14,124
Lousy human bastards!

135
00:12:21,046 --> 00:12:22,981
Who said that?

136
00:12:24,050 --> 00:12:25,985
I did.

137
00:12:26,053 --> 00:12:29,491
He's a performing ape for my circus.

138
00:12:29,558 --> 00:12:32,187
- A talking ape?
- No!

139
00:12:32,262 --> 00:12:34,788
That's impossible.
It was I who spoke.

140
00:12:34,865 --> 00:12:38,996
Didn't sound like you.
Yell "lousy human bastards."

141
00:12:39,071 --> 00:12:41,506
That's not what I said.

142
00:12:41,574 --> 00:12:43,509
That's what I heard.

143
00:12:43,577 --> 00:12:46,570
Yell "lousy human bastards!"

144
00:12:46,649 --> 00:12:48,514
Lousy human bastards.

145
00:12:48,584 --> 00:12:50,553
We said yell!

146
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:52,282
Lousy human bastards!

147
00:12:52,357 --> 00:12:55,521
- Yeah. Yeah. Could be.
- I don't think so.

148
00:12:55,594 --> 00:12:58,063
That's right.
The ape spoke.

149
00:12:58,131 --> 00:12:59,622
No, they're mistaken.

150
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:03,501
I admit my behavior was inexcusable,
and I am deeply sorry , but--

151
00:13:03,572 --> 00:13:07,305
- We better take him to headquarters.
- You're right.

152
00:13:07,378 --> 00:13:08,709
Otto, no!

153
00:13:09,848 --> 00:13:11,680
No! Otto, no!

154
00:13:17,291 --> 00:13:18,725
[Groans]

155
00:13:32,546 --> 00:13:34,640
Move him out.

156
00:13:41,225 --> 00:13:43,250
Oh, Armando, forgive me.

157
00:13:43,327 --> 00:13:48,028
Oh, no, no. You only said out loud
what I was thinking.

158
00:13:48,101 --> 00:13:51,470
I'm sorry .
I was so angry .

159
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:55,102
I might have bluffed it through
if you hadn't run away.

160
00:13:55,178 --> 00:13:57,613
Now they'll suspect
you're understanding all that was said.

161
00:13:57,681 --> 00:14:01,619
Armando,
let's go back to the circus.

162
00:14:01,687 --> 00:14:03,315
No, no, no.

163
00:14:03,390 --> 00:14:04,482
Please.

164
00:14:04,558 --> 00:14:06,891
That's the first place they'll look.

165
00:14:24,419 --> 00:14:27,184
Here's what we'll do.

166
00:14:27,256 --> 00:14:29,191
- I'll go to the police.
- Oh, no, no, no.

167
00:14:29,259 --> 00:14:31,319
It's the only way.

168
00:14:31,395 --> 00:14:35,629
I'll say I couldn't find you,

169
00:14:35,702 --> 00:14:39,901
that, uh, you've run away before,
that big cities frighten you.

170
00:14:39,974 --> 00:14:42,911
- But where would I go?
- You wait right here.

171
00:14:42,979 --> 00:14:46,245
- If this works,
I'll be back by nightfall.
- But what if it doesn't?

172
00:14:46,316 --> 00:14:49,844
- What if they don't let you go?
- They will. They will.

173
00:14:52,091 --> 00:14:55,824
But just in case,
if I am not back by then,

174
00:14:55,897 --> 00:15:00,336
these steps go down to a tunnel
that leads to the harbor.

175
00:15:00,403 --> 00:15:03,567
Cargoes of apes
are frequently unloaded at night.

176
00:15:03,641 --> 00:15:06,702
You must infiltrate
one of them.

177
00:15:06,778 --> 00:15:09,612
Apes imported from overseas
arrive naked.

178
00:15:09,682 --> 00:15:12,346
- You'll have to
get rid of these clothes.
- I don't want to.

179
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:15,356
We must have an alternate plan.
Don't you see?

180
00:15:18,061 --> 00:15:21,793
Right now,
the only safe hiding place for you

181
00:15:21,866 --> 00:15:23,801
is among your own kind.

182
00:15:38,456 --> 00:15:40,391
I shouldn't be long.

183
00:15:54,158 --> 00:15:55,921
Why would you say "human"?

184
00:15:55,993 --> 00:15:59,192
That's a very odd thing
for another human being to say.

185
00:15:59,265 --> 00:16:02,497
I didn't say "human," Mr. Governor.
I said "inhuman."

186
00:16:02,569 --> 00:16:04,504
"Lousy inhuman bastards."

187
00:16:04,572 --> 00:16:08,407
And by the blessed St. Francis,
who loved all animals, I meant it.

188
00:16:08,477 --> 00:16:10,412
I run a circus, and--

189
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,642
- We know that.
- From 20 years back.

190
00:16:12,717 --> 00:16:14,652
From the year, Senor Armando,

191
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:17,747
when the two talking apes
arrived and conceived a baby

192
00:16:17,824 --> 00:16:21,557
whose survival could have threatened
the future of the entire human race.

193
00:16:21,630 --> 00:16:25,590
Mr. Governor, it's my understanding
the baby was shot dead.

194
00:16:25,668 --> 00:16:27,637
Or so it was believed.

195
00:16:27,704 --> 00:16:29,639
However, ever since this morning

196
00:16:29,707 --> 00:16:33,235
I'm beginning to wonder
if they shot the right baby.

197
00:16:33,312 --> 00:16:36,875
They could have switched their baby
with one from a zoo.

198
00:16:36,951 --> 00:16:38,852
Or perhaps a circus.

199
00:16:38,921 --> 00:16:40,616
Surely you can't be serious.

200
00:16:40,689 --> 00:16:44,718
Hoskyns, the cassette, please.

201
00:16:47,332 --> 00:16:49,301
This is a recording
of the recommendations

202
00:16:49,368 --> 00:16:52,532
made to the then president
of the United States

203
00:16:52,606 --> 00:16:55,941
by the chairman of
the presidential committee.

204
00:16:58,348 --> 00:17:03,378
We believe that the talking apes,
Cornelius and Zira,

205
00:17:03,455 --> 00:17:05,514
have come from the future.

206
00:17:05,591 --> 00:17:07,822
We believe their spoken testimony

207
00:17:07,894 --> 00:17:10,261
thatsome2,000yearshence,

208
00:17:10,331 --> 00:17:14,793
their descendants will have
all but exterminated the human race.

209
00:17:14,871 --> 00:17:18,639
The female ape
is now pregnant with child.

210
00:17:18,710 --> 00:17:21,612
The commission therefore recommends

211
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:27,086
that the ape child's birth
should be prevented,

212
00:17:27,154 --> 00:17:30,147
and that both the male and the female

213
00:17:30,225 --> 00:17:34,027
should be rendered incapable
of begetting another.

214
00:17:37,937 --> 00:17:42,808
But, Mr. Governor, every zoo, public
and private, was searched by the police,

215
00:17:42,877 --> 00:17:44,845
and every circus,
including my own.

216
00:17:44,913 --> 00:17:46,848
Where a small chimpanzee was found.

217
00:17:46,916 --> 00:17:49,852
The only chimpanzee
ever to be born in a circus,

218
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:52,515
and legally certified
to have been born

219
00:17:52,591 --> 00:17:57,154
a month before the talking apes
arrived on earth.

220
00:17:57,230 --> 00:17:59,165
- Where is he now?
- I wish I knew.

221
00:17:59,233 --> 00:18:02,397
- I've searched everywhere.
- Senor Armando!

222
00:18:03,372 --> 00:18:05,739
Let me remind you

223
00:18:05,809 --> 00:18:09,941
of the seriousness
of our problem.

224
00:18:10,015 --> 00:18:14,043
Now, your circus travels
mainly in the provinces?

225
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:15,850
Yes, sir.

226
00:18:15,923 --> 00:18:17,915
Undoubtedly, you are unaware

227
00:18:17,993 --> 00:18:21,691
of the rising tide of disobedience
and outright defiance

228
00:18:21,764 --> 00:18:26,328
among the servant apes
in our cities.

229
00:18:26,404 --> 00:18:29,807
Mr. Governor, many of the reported
offenses have been proved minor.

230
00:18:29,876 --> 00:18:33,369
That ape who was killed while trying
to escape from the city last night,

231
00:18:33,448 --> 00:18:35,280
would you call his offense minor?

232
00:18:35,351 --> 00:18:37,047
No, I would not.

233
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:39,749
He physically assaulted his own master.

234
00:18:39,824 --> 00:18:42,259
But only after what must
have been severe provocation.

235
00:18:42,327 --> 00:18:46,628
The ape's body was covered
with bruises from a beating.

236
00:18:46,699 --> 00:18:49,829
Which he no doubt richly deserved.

237
00:18:49,904 --> 00:18:54,137
How many more out there
are just like that ape,

238
00:18:54,210 --> 00:18:56,806
all burning with resentment,

239
00:18:56,881 --> 00:18:59,715

with enough intelligence,

240
00:18:59,785 --> 00:19:02,414
with enough will to lead them?

241
00:19:02,489 --> 00:19:07,554
Waiting for an ape
who can think, who can talk.

242
00:19:10,066 --> 00:19:14,232
Senor Armando,
has your ape ever talked

243
00:19:14,305 --> 00:19:17,833
or shown any signs
of being articulate?

244
00:19:17,910 --> 00:19:20,345
Never in my presence
or anyone else's.

These figures seem inflated.
Did you double-check them?

358
00:32:01,271 --> 00:32:03,137
- Yes, sir.
- Then triple-check them.

359
00:32:03,208 --> 00:32:04,608
No. Come.

360
00:32:04,677 --> 00:32:07,112
Hold all calls, Miss Greer.

361
00:32:07,180 --> 00:32:10,116
Here's the IQ profile on all apes
tested in the last four weeks.

362
00:32:10,184 --> 00:32:12,619
It's risen by 3 2/3 points.

363
00:32:12,688 --> 00:32:15,749
Show that to Mr. MacDonald.
He thinks I'm imagining things.

364
00:32:15,825 --> 00:32:18,762
I assembled that data, Morgan.
You summarized the wrong part.

365
00:32:18,830 --> 00:32:21,925
As a result, their work output
has increased about the same percentage,

366
00:32:22,001 --> 00:32:25,335
which I thought the governor
might regard as good news.

367
00:32:25,406 --> 00:32:27,841
We'll go over that later.

368
00:32:32,416 --> 00:32:33,509
No.

369
00:32:35,921 --> 00:32:37,354
Watch.

370
00:32:55,147 --> 00:32:57,013
Do.

371
00:33:16,411 --> 00:33:18,346
[Shrieking]

372
00:33:18,414 --> 00:33:20,906
No, no, no.
Clean, clean.

373
00:33:20,984 --> 00:33:24,443
The little fellow's
not so bright after all.

374
00:33:24,522 --> 00:33:27,857
No, but then brightness
has never been encouraged among slaves.

375
00:33:27,927 --> 00:33:30,556
Oh, don't be so touchy,
Mr. MacDonald.

376
00:33:30,631 --> 00:33:34,398
All of us were slaves once,
in one sense of the word or another.

377
00:33:34,469 --> 00:33:37,337
We can send him back
for reconditioning.

378
00:33:37,406 --> 00:33:39,034
That isn't necessary .

379
00:33:39,109 --> 00:33:41,544
You're quite right,
Mr. MacDonald,

380
00:33:41,613 --> 00:33:44,606
but not for any of your
bleeding-heart reasons.

381
00:33:44,683 --> 00:33:47,882
Reconditioning.
That's all you ever think of.

382
00:33:47,955 --> 00:33:52,188
If we took every ape who muffed
an assignment or disobeyed an order

383
00:33:52,261 --> 00:33:54,196
and sent him back
for reconditioning,

384
00:33:54,264 --> 00:33:56,893
Ape Management would become
impossibly overcrowded.

385
00:33:56,967 --> 00:33:59,232
It's the only thing
that has any effect.

386
00:33:59,304 --> 00:34:03,367
-Just makes them worse.
- Some of them couldn't be worse.

387
00:34:03,443 --> 00:34:06,345
I've been having
a comprehensive list compiled.

388
00:34:06,414 --> 00:34:08,849
- Mr. Governor?
- Yes? What is it?

389
00:34:08,918 --> 00:34:12,856
- It's time for your meeting
with the defense council.
- I'll be along in a moment.

390
00:34:12,924 --> 00:34:15,860
- Defense council?
- I'll tell you all about it later.

391
00:34:15,928 --> 00:34:18,864
Has this anything to do
with the list you just mentioned?

392
00:34:18,932 --> 00:34:20,867
You'll be given full details.

393
00:34:20,935 --> 00:34:25,374
Meanwhile, we're going to recondition
this little fellow ourselves.

394
00:34:25,441 --> 00:34:27,876
- We haven't named him yet, have we?
- No, Mr. Breck.

395
00:34:27,945 --> 00:34:30,881
Well, I'm going to revive
a charming tradition

396
00:34:30,949 --> 00:34:33,885
established in her lifetime
by my dear wife

397
00:34:33,953 --> 00:34:35,888
and let you name yourself.

398
00:35:08,368 --> 00:35:09,961
Caesar.

399
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:13,608
A king.

400
00:35:17,776 --> 00:35:18,606
[Buzzer]

401
00:35:19,812 --> 00:35:20,904
Yes?

402
00:35:23,150 --> 00:35:26,087
They're waiting for you
in the council chamber.

403
00:35:27,990 --> 00:35:31,257
We'll never make a bartender
out of Caesar.

404
00:35:31,329 --> 00:35:33,628
Have him detailed
to the command post.

405
00:35:48,686 --> 00:35:51,281
[Both Grunt]

406
00:35:52,358 --> 00:35:54,919
[Whimpering]

407
00:36:05,309 --> 00:36:06,743
No.

408
00:36:18,962 --> 00:36:23,526
Attention. There are reports of
unescorted apes in the plaza.

409
00:36:23,602 --> 00:36:25,798
Investigate.

410
00:36:27,574 --> 00:36:29,509
No, no, when you're deciphering,

411
00:36:29,577 --> 00:36:33,015
the internal indicator
is the second code.

412
00:36:34,584 --> 00:36:37,520
- It hasn't been declassified yet.
- Can I help you?

413
00:36:37,588 --> 00:36:39,819
This ape's been assigned
to the command post.

414
00:36:39,891 --> 00:36:41,826
- What's his name, sir?
- Caesar.

415
00:36:41,894 --> 00:36:45,525
- Start him off in the files.
Low priority traffic.
- Yes, sir.

416
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:49,037
First check the priority,
then the action addressee.

417
00:36:49,104 --> 00:36:50,663
Do.

418
00:36:54,078 --> 00:36:56,047
Lisa.

419
00:36:56,114 --> 00:36:57,548
Lisa!

420
00:37:08,932 --> 00:37:10,833
Ah, Senor Armando.

421
00:37:10,902 --> 00:37:12,837
Guards, you may go.

422
00:37:12,905 --> 00:37:15,033
- This way, Senor.
- Sit down, sit down.

423
00:37:15,108 --> 00:37:17,042
We have good news for you.

424
00:37:19,380 --> 00:37:20,814
Good news?

425
00:37:20,882 --> 00:37:23,374
Yes.
You're to be released.

426
00:37:23,452 --> 00:37:27,823
Inspector Hoskyns and I have come to
believe that your ape is not the child

427
00:37:27,892 --> 00:37:30,327
of the two talking chimpanzees.

428
00:37:32,399 --> 00:37:34,333
You found him?

429
00:37:34,402 --> 00:37:37,236
Not yet, but he'll turn up.

430
00:37:37,306 --> 00:37:40,333
I'm sorry for the inconvenience.

431
00:37:40,410 --> 00:37:43,005
Please forgive us.
It was unavoidable.

432
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:45,015
Oh, yes, yes.

433
00:37:46,919 --> 00:37:49,149
Then I'm free to go?

434
00:37:49,222 --> 00:37:53,353
As soon as you sign
this sworn declaration.

435
00:37:54,930 --> 00:37:56,899
What does it say?

436
00:37:56,967 --> 00:38:00,904
Only what you've been saying-- that the
circus ape is incapable of human speech

437
00:38:00,972 --> 00:38:04,239
and to the best of your knowledge
has never uttered a word.

438
00:38:04,310 --> 00:38:07,405
- Certainly.
- Excellent.

439
00:38:07,481 --> 00:38:12,113
We'll check this with the authenticator.
Then you'll be free to go.

440
00:38:13,756 --> 00:38:17,489
- The, uh, authenticator?
- Oh, it's just a formality.

441
00:38:17,562 --> 00:38:21,500
Sit back down, please.
It'll just take a moment.

442
00:38:35,453 --> 00:38:38,446
What does the authenticator do?

443
00:38:38,524 --> 00:38:41,791
It makes people tell the truth.
It's quite painless.

444
00:38:41,863 --> 00:38:45,766
You said the first time you heard
the name Cornelius was in this office.

445
00:38:45,834 --> 00:38:48,600
Was that true?

446
00:38:58,052 --> 00:38:59,953
No.

447
00:39:00,021 --> 00:39:02,183
Now, there.
You see?

448
00:39:02,258 --> 00:39:05,353
But that's not really
a mark against you.

449
00:39:05,429 --> 00:39:08,366
You most probably heard it
somewhere else before.

450
00:39:08,434 --> 00:39:12,303
Now, about your statement,
sworn statement,

451
00:39:12,372 --> 00:39:16,310
that the circus ape
is incapable of speech.

452
00:39:16,378 --> 00:39:18,870
No.
I won't submit to this.

453
00:39:18,948 --> 00:39:20,415
You will.

454
00:39:20,484 --> 00:39:24,148
I have done nothing wrong!
You are treating me like a criminal!

455
00:39:24,222 --> 00:39:25,656
Sit back, please.

456
00:39:27,226 --> 00:39:28,660
No. No.

457
00:39:28,729 --> 00:39:30,994
- Guard!
- No!

458
00:39:31,065 --> 00:39:32,966
No.

459
00:39:36,506 --> 00:39:38,873
Hell no!

460
00:39:50,024 --> 00:39:52,516
I knew that circus owner was lying!

461
00:39:52,596 --> 00:39:55,532
- He fell to his death accidentally.
- While trying to escape.

462
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:58,035
He knew he'd been exposed.

463
00:41:02,627 --> 00:41:06,064
[Hissing]

464
00:41:10,638 --> 00:41:13,574
Aah!

465
00:41:26,126 --> 00:41:28,755
Attention. Attention.

466
00:41:28,831 --> 00:41:31,031
Last night, several security forces
apprehended and placed in custody

467
00:41:31,031 --> 00:41:33,296
Last night, several security forces
apprehended and placed in custody

468
00:41:33,368 --> 00:41:38,239
a number of servant apes
from households throughout the city

469
00:41:38,308 --> 00:41:42,303
who had gathered clan destinely
in the unused building

470
00:41:42,381 --> 00:41:44,145
on the outskirts
of the east sector.

471
00:41:44,217 --> 00:41:47,210
Property owners are firmly warned

472
00:41:47,288 --> 00:41:49,723
that they bearsole responsibility

473
00:41:49,792 --> 00:41:53,229
for the behavior and whereabouts
of their servant apes.

474
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:28,208
[Grunting]

475
00:42:42,198 --> 00:42:45,897
[All Hooting]

476
00:42:45,971 --> 00:42:47,233
Frank.

477
00:42:52,814 --> 00:42:54,247
Frank.

478
00:42:59,823 --> 00:43:02,418
- [Grunts]
- No!

479
00:43:25,259 --> 00:43:28,627
"One dozen steaks, New York cut,

480
00:43:28,697 --> 00:43:31,223
for Mrs. Van Thal."

481
00:43:31,301 --> 00:43:33,236
Yeah, OK.

482
00:43:33,304 --> 00:43:35,739
Add one gallon ofk--
No.

483
00:43:37,076 --> 00:43:39,340
Two...

484
00:43:39,412 --> 00:43:41,404
gallons...

485
00:43:41,481 --> 00:43:44,748
of kerosene.

486
00:43:57,237 --> 00:43:59,763
Mr. Governor,
the latest ape disobedience figures.

487
00:43:59,841 --> 00:44:03,209
There's been a marked increase
in property damage.

488
00:44:03,279 --> 00:44:05,908
It couldn't all be carelessness,
Mr. MacDonald.

489
00:44:05,983 --> 00:44:09,216
Arrange for distribution
of the Achilles' List,

490
00:44:09,288 --> 00:44:11,723
copies to each police precinct.

491
00:44:11,791 --> 00:44:15,228
Details are to be left
to the individual commanders,
but I want every ape on that list

492
00:44:15,296 --> 00:44:20,133
rounded up and delivered to
the reconditioning center
by 0600 tomorrow morning.

493
00:44:20,203 --> 00:44:23,230
I'm sorry , 309.
The cages are full.

494
00:44:23,307 --> 00:44:26,243
We cannot accommodate any new intakes

495
00:44:26,311 --> 00:44:28,473
until after Tuesday's auction.

496
00:44:28,547 --> 00:44:31,244
I repeat that.
After Tuesday's auction.

497
00:44:36,626 --> 00:44:40,723
"Collect one repaired Colt .45."

498
00:44:41,833 --> 00:44:43,768
Add...

499
00:44:43,836 --> 00:44:49,572
1 00 rounds ammunition.

500
00:44:56,154 --> 00:45:00,615
The Achilles' List,
referring to our Achilles' heel,

501
00:45:00,692 --> 00:45:03,561
contains the name of every ape
who over the past year

502
00:45:03,631 --> 00:45:05,758
has been guilty of overt disobedience.

503
00:45:05,833 --> 00:45:11,001
- The charge against them is nonsense.
- It will do for my purposes.

504
00:45:11,075 --> 00:45:15,240
They constitute the hard core of our
problem, and I'm going to crush them.

505
00:45:15,313 --> 00:45:18,751
You will only further
aggravate the problem.

506
00:45:18,819 --> 00:45:24,020
This action is folly,
and I wish to protest it
in the strongest possible terms.

507
00:45:24,093 --> 00:45:26,528
Very well, Mr. MacDonald.

508
00:45:26,596 --> 00:45:29,725
Your protest has been duly noted.

509
00:45:29,800 --> 00:45:34,501
From now on, you have one assignment--
to find that talking ape.

510

[Buzzer]

512
00:45:48,594 --> 00:45:51,291
What is this?
A red alert?

513
00:45:51,364 --> 00:45:52,798
Sort of.

514
00:45:52,867 --> 00:45:57,202
Ape Management computer's
come up with a rather intriguing error.

515
00:45:57,272 --> 00:45:59,707
Shipment 507-l for Indonesia

516
00:45:59,775 --> 00:46:02,210
comprised three orangutans
and one chimpanzee.

517
00:46:02,279 --> 00:46:03,770
So?

518
00:46:04,916 --> 00:46:07,751
There are no chimpanzees in Borneo.

519
00:46:07,821 --> 00:46:09,846
Yes, sir. One moment.

520
00:46:09,923 --> 00:46:12,358
State Security Chief Inspector Kolp
on line three.

521
00:46:12,426 --> 00:46:13,860
Yes, Inspector?

522
00:46:13,929 --> 00:46:17,867
Give me the Indonesian file
for last month.

523
00:46:17,935 --> 00:46:21,531
That's 507 ex-Borneo.

524
00:46:21,606 --> 00:46:23,871
Right, Inspector.
Let me check.

525
00:46:23,943 --> 00:46:27,346
507 ex-Borneo.
Yes, sir.

526
00:46:27,415 --> 00:46:29,576
That chimpanzee was sold
to Governor Breck.

527
00:46:29,651 --> 00:46:31,586
Just as I first thought!

528
00:46:31,654 --> 00:46:34,590
We've had him under our noses
all the time!

529
00:46:34,658 --> 00:46:38,562
I'll have the ape executed immediately
on your verbal orders alone.

530
00:46:38,630 --> 00:46:40,997
- You'll have it in writing.
- Thank you, sir.

531
00:46:41,067 --> 00:46:43,730
Get Mr. MacDonald
at the command post.

532
00:46:43,804 --> 00:46:45,796
Suppose he won't speak?

533
00:46:45,874 --> 00:46:47,843
I don't understand.

534
00:46:47,910 --> 00:46:51,347
What the chief inspector means is,
there'd still be a doubt.

535
00:46:51,415 --> 00:46:54,408
If the chimpanzee keeps his mouth shut,
the case stays open.

536
00:46:54,486 --> 00:46:56,579
We'd like to close the file.

537
00:46:56,655 --> 00:46:59,751
You shall.
I promise you.

538
00:46:59,827 --> 00:47:02,262
Reconditioning applications
are made in triplicate.

539
00:47:02,331 --> 00:47:05,733
A disturbance in the north plaza?
What kind of disturbance?

540
00:47:05,802 --> 00:47:10,036
MacDonald speaking.
Yes, sir.

541
00:47:10,108 --> 00:47:13,977
You want me to turn
Caesar over to Kolp?

542
00:47:14,046 --> 00:47:16,607
He's on your Achilles' List?

543
00:47:16,684 --> 00:47:20,382
Mr. MacDonald,
do not question an order.

544
00:47:20,456 --> 00:47:23,255
No, I'm not questioning the orders.

545
00:47:25,263 --> 00:47:29,167
I sent him out on an errand.
He should be back momentarily.

546
00:47:30,570 --> 00:47:34,565
Yes, sir.
I'll do just as you say.

547
00:47:47,394 --> 00:47:48,656
Come.

548
00:47:59,010 --> 00:48:01,445
No, this goes
to Traffc Control!

549
00:48:01,514 --> 00:48:04,382
Take it easy.
They can't read.

550
00:48:04,451 --> 00:48:06,386
Not yet, they can't.

551
00:48:09,458 --> 00:48:10,891
Do!

552
00:48:13,464 --> 00:48:15,091
Mr. MacDonald,

553
00:48:15,166 --> 00:48:17,397
are you near a phone?

554
00:48:18,604 --> 00:48:21,733
Mr. MacDonald,
it is imperative

555
00:48:21,809 --> 00:48:24,904
that you get to a phone.

556
00:48:26,623 --> 00:48:29,787
Come in, Mr. MacDonald.
Do you hear me?

557
00:48:29,860 --> 00:48:33,298
Get to a phone and come in.

558
00:48:34,367 --> 00:48:36,302
Now come in.

559
00:48:39,074 --> 00:48:40,473
Yes, Mr. Governor?

560
00:48:40,542 --> 00:48:42,807
Kelp is on his way.

561
00:48:42,878 --> 00:48:45,508
- Is Caesar back yet?
- Not yet, sir.

562
00:48:45,583 --> 00:48:49,520
- I'll keep a lookout.
- Notify me the moment he's handed over.

563
00:48:50,590 --> 00:48:52,023
Yes, sir.

564
00:49:08,849 --> 00:49:12,115
I wish...

565
00:49:12,186 --> 00:49:16,625
I wish there was some way we could
communicate so you'd understand that l--

566
00:49:20,365 --> 00:49:23,494
I understand,

567
00:49:23,569 --> 00:49:25,504
Mr. MacDonald.

568
00:49:32,114 --> 00:49:34,640
Yes, l--

569
00:49:34,718 --> 00:49:37,244
I'm the one they're looking for.

570
00:49:47,337 --> 00:49:51,274
I never believed it.
I thought you were a myth.

571
00:49:51,342 --> 00:49:55,007
Well, I'm not.

572
00:49:55,081 --> 00:49:58,017
But I will tell you
something that is.

573
00:49:58,085 --> 00:50:00,520
The belief that
human beings are kind.

574
00:50:00,588 --> 00:50:02,580
No, Caesar.
There are some--

575
00:50:02,658 --> 00:50:05,594
A handful, perhaps, but not most.

576
00:50:05,662 --> 00:50:09,532
They won't learn to be kind
until we force them to.

577
00:50:09,601 --> 00:50:13,538
We can't do that
until we are free.

578
00:50:13,606 --> 00:50:17,544
How do you propose
to gain this freedom?

579
00:50:17,612 --> 00:50:22,244
By the only means left to us--
revolution.

580
00:50:22,319 --> 00:50:24,914
But it's doomed to failure.

581
00:50:24,989 --> 00:50:26,890
Perhaps.

582
00:50:26,959 --> 00:50:28,756
- This time.
- And the next.

583
00:50:28,827 --> 00:50:31,730
- Maybe.
- But you'll keep trying.

584
00:50:31,799 --> 00:50:36,568
You above every one else
should understand.

585
00:50:36,639 --> 00:50:39,575
We cannot be free
until we have power.

586
00:50:39,643 --> 00:50:43,478
How else can we achieve it?

587
00:50:52,761 --> 00:50:53,693
Go!

588
00:51:06,079 --> 00:51:11,714
Mr. MacDonald, I have an order to have
the ape Caesar taken into custody.

589
00:51:11,788 --> 00:51:13,723
I know.
I've been looking for him.

590
00:51:13,791 --> 00:51:15,816
- He's not in the command post?
- No.

591
00:51:15,893 --> 00:51:20,195
Issue an order to round up
all unaccompanied apes.

594
00:53:10,388 --> 00:53:13,324
I still don't see why
he made a run for it.

595
00:53:13,392 --> 00:53:15,827
It's really quite simple.

596
00:53:15,895 --> 00:53:18,091
The ape has intelligence.

597
00:53:18,165 --> 00:53:20,464
He learned Armando was dead.

598
00:53:20,535 --> 00:53:23,937
He assumed the man
betrayed him under torture.

599
00:53:24,007 --> 00:53:26,910
But we don't do that to humans.

600
00:53:33,353 --> 00:53:34,616
Now.

601
00:53:44,136 --> 00:53:45,728

Well, there's your proof.

620
00:55:06,684 --> 00:55:08,380
We're convinced, Mr. Governor.

621
00:55:08,454 --> 00:55:12,050
It's fantastic.
Absolutely fantastic.

622
00:55:12,125 --> 00:55:14,060
Have it say something else.

00:55:17,901 --> 00:55:19,892

[Growling]

627
00:55:31,386 --> 00:55:34,584
- We could persuade him.
- No.

628
00:55:34,657 --> 00:55:37,628
He's not responsible for what he is.

629
00:55:37,695 --> 00:55:39,595
Still, seeing him there,

630
00:55:39,664 --> 00:55:43,067
it's like looking
at some deadly bacillus

631
00:55:43,136 --> 00:55:48,337
and knowing you've got it
bottled up at last.

632
00:55:51,714 --> 00:55:54,844
- Is that all, sir?
- Not quite.

633
00:55:56,888 --> 00:56:00,587
I have authorization here from the
governor to have this beast destroyed.

634
00:56:00,660 --> 00:56:02,093
I'll notify the vet.

635
00:56:03,965 --> 00:56:05,900
He is wired for electrocution,
isn't he?

636
00:56:05,968 --> 00:56:08,802
- Yes.
- Well, then electrocute him now.

Very good work, Inspector.

642
00:57:03,845 --> 00:57:05,780
What happened to Mr. MacDonald?

01:00:05,967 --> 01:00:08,766
There's $50,000 worth of apes
in jeopardy.

652
01:00:08,838 --> 01:00:12,241
Get them out of here alive.

Yes!
Commander, I understand the situation.

657

Assemble as large a force
as you can and follow them.

658
01:02:10,443 --> 01:02:12,776
Order full mobilization
of all security forces--

659
01:02:12,846 --> 01:02:14,711
police, militia
and reserve defense units.

660
01:02:14,782 --> 01:02:17,877
Cordon off every entrance to the city.

661
01:02:17,953 --> 01:02:20,889
Our control method is to include
tear gas and sedation darts?

662
01:02:20,957 --> 01:02:25,794
There will be but one control method--
shoot to kill.

663
01:02:25,864 --> 01:02:27,856
A small group of apes

664
01:02:27,934 --> 01:02:29,869
scheduled for intensivere conditioning

665
01:02:29,937 --> 01:02:32,372
have escaped from Ape Management.

666
01:02:32,440 --> 01:02:34,500
Until they've been
rounded up by police,

667
01:02:34,577 --> 01:02:37,638
all citizens are requested
to remain indoors.

668
01:02:37,714 --> 01:02:41,412

as soon as recapture is effected.

I guess here it is.

670
01:02:45,859 --> 01:02:48,988
Ape Management
is in the hands of the apes.

671
01:02:49,063 --> 01:02:52,398
Many officials are either dead
or held hostage.

672
01:02:52,468 --> 01:02:56,428
The main band of rioting apes are at
this very moment marching on the city.

673
01:02:56,507 --> 01:02:59,444
It's been established that the ape mob

674
01:02:59,512 --> 01:03:03,279
is under the command of
a supernormally intelligent chimpanzee

675
01:03:03,350 --> 01:03:05,182
who has...

676
01:03:05,253 --> 01:03:07,162
acquired the power of speech.

677
01:03:07,296 --> 01:03:10,095

Get out a retraction immediately!

01:03:10,166 --> 01:03:14,036

has been apprehended and put to death.

chimpanzees Cornelius and Zira,

to the future to the whole human race.

were once our ancestors.

against flame throwers?

And, in that smoke,
from this day forward,

817
01:22:15,200 --> 01:22:20,731
my people will crouch
and conspire and plot and plan

for the inevitable day
of man's downfall,

and self-destructively

turns his weapons against his own kind,

821
01:22:30,854 --> 01:22:33,916
the day of the writing in the sky

under radioactive rubble,

out of which I will lead my people
from their captivity.

826
01:22:47,017 --> 01:22:51,854
We shall build our own cities in which
there will be no place for humans

Now we will put down our weapons.

836
01:24:21,116 --> 01:24:24,986
We have passed through
the night of the fires,

837
01:24:26,356 --> 01:24:29,520
and those who were our masters

838
01:24:29,595 --> 01:24:32,622
are now our servants!

839
01:24:32,699 --> 01:24:36,967
And we, who are not human,

840
01:24:37,038 --> 01:24:41,772
can afford to be humane.

841
01:24:41,844 --> 01:24:44,974
Destiny is the will of God,

842
01:24:45,049 --> 01:24:50,045
and if it is man's destiny
to be dominated,

843
01:24:50,123 --> 01:24:52,422
it is God's will

844
01:24:52,493 --> 01:24:57,296
that he be dominated with compassion

845
01:24:57,367 --> 01:25:00,360
