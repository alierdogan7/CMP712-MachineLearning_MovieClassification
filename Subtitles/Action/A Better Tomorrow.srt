1
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:45,100
Kit!

2
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:50,300
Kit!

3
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:21,500
- Two dollars.
- Okay.

4
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:31,000
- Mark.
- Coming.

5
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Hey, the plate!

6
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:43,600
Sir.

7
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:49,100
Tastes good?

8
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,200
Are you alright?

9
00:03:57,700 --> 00:04:00,000
- Here, go see a doctor.
- Thanks, Mark.

10
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,100
Can you read that?

11
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:15,500
What?

12
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,900
It's all in English.

13
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:34,600
You're good at bullshitting.
Your English has improved.

14
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:37,400
- You can even say "Of course"!
- Of course!

15
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:42,500
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

16
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:45,900
Good morning.

17
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:52,300
- Good morning, Mark.
- That's "Brother Mark".

18
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:57,100
Mr. Yiu.

19
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:59,000
Ho, you're back.

20
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:00,300
Everything okay?

21
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:01,800
- I already checked it.
- Great.

22
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,500
It's easy dealing with the foreigners.

23
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:06,500
They are not all trustworthy.

24
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,900
You trust people too easily.

25
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:09,900
Thanks.

26
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:11,700
You're Shing? Take a seat.

27
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,500
No, thanks, I'll stand.

28
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:20,100
Good morning, Linda.

29
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:28,100
Rose!

30
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:31,400
Shing, you can learn a lot from Ho.

31
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:33,300
He is the most loyal.

32
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:37,300
Yes, he can teach me a lot.

33
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:41,800
Mark is a bit frivolous, but he is loyal.

34
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,900
Yes, he takes good care of me.

35
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
What's that?

36
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:47,100
Nothing, we're just talking about you.

37
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:48,200
Really?

38
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:52,000
Your brother, Kit, graduates today.

39
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:54,100
Oh, yeah!

40
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:56,700
I forgot to get him a present.

41
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,100
I gotta go.

42
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:02,200
Ho, take Shing with you to Taiwan
day after tomorrow.

43
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:06,000
Give the youngster a change.

44
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:10,700
Taiwan! You got the guts?!

45
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:13,700
I've been at this for years,
and I'm still afraid. Know why?

46
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:16,800
The drills, choppers, Taiwan gangs!
Even the beer drinking can kill you!

47
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:18,600
- Don't make fun of him.
- Okay.

48
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,400
So, Kit graduated...
get him a woman for a gift!

49
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:23,600
No, I won't let him go astray like us.

50
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:25,400
Hey, it's better than getting a hooker.

51
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
I want to see him
get a doctorate degree...

52
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:30,400
...and see him get married...

53
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:32,500
See him consummate his marriage,
have a baby...

54
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:34,300
...then his life will be even harder!

55
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:39,700
They say, "One with a dirty mouth
steps on shit entering an elevator! "

56
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,000
You first.

57
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:45,200
I won't! Let's step in together!

58
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:07,600
Don't move. Police!

59
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:08,900
- Search!
- Yes, sir.

60
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Don't move!

61
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:12,100
- Don't joke with me.
- Turn around.

62
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,600
We both have guns.

63
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:15,600
If you don't respect me,
I won't respect you.

64
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:18,000
Let's see who is not
respecting the other.

65
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:24,300
That tickles! Don't...

66
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,400
Enough!

67
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:27,600
Enough.

68
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Brother, I have some good news.

69
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:34,700
I've been accepted to become
a Police Inspector. Surprised?

70
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,900
It'll be hard work.

71
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,100
You'll be Police Commissioner
one day.

72
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:42,900
Jackie!

73
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:46,000
She's my girlfriend.
She helps take care of dad.

74
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:47,200
My big brother.

75
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:48,300
Hi.

76
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:53,600
Don't worry, dad's in good hands.

77
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:01,000
- Thank you very much.
- Don't mention it.

78
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:03,200
It's time for my audition!

79
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:08,300
A new girlfriend...
I hope this time it'll last.

80
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:11,000
It'll depend on how she behaves.

81
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:13,000
You said you would go with me.

82
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:14,700
Hurry up!

83
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:17,300
I'd love to stay, but...

84
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:20,200
No need to explain, get out of here!

85
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:21,800
Excuse me.

86
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,500
- Let's go.
- Hurry up!

87
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:25,700
Bye.

88
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:35,900
- Ho...
- Dad.

89
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:38,400
You should get out of the business.

90
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:42,000
Your brother has no idea
what you are doing.

91
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:46,900
I remember when you kids played
"Cops & Robbers" together.

92
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:49,000
Even when he lost...

93
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:51,800
...he still wanted to be the cop.

94
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:55,900
I don't want to see you two brothers
play this game for real.

95
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:59,800
Give it up for the sake of
your brother.

96
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:05,900
- Okay?
- Alright.

97
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
It's about time.

98
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:22,000
- Sorry, the traffic was horrible.
- A real traffic jam.

99
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:23,200
I'm Jackie.

100
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:25,900
- Give me a chance, please!
- Give her a chance!

101
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:29,600
- Careful, she's pregnant!
- Are you alright?

102
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:31,200
Sir, the traffic was awful!

103
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:33,400
- Please give her a chance?
- Okay.

104
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,100
Alright, go, go ahead!

105
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,800
Pregnant and getting
pushed like that...

106
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:46,200
Hey, panel judges, please listen.

107
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,100
Sorry.

108
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:26,800
It's all your fault! You embarrassed
me before I went on stage!

109
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:28,400
You can't help in any way!

110
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:31,200
You don't even have confidence
in yourself. How can I help?

111
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:33,900
They didn't say you failed.
You don't know it's hopeless.

112
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,500
Give that back to me!

113
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,300
Now it's really hopeless!

114
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,100
Have you decided?

115
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:56,500
One last job, then I'll quit.

116
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,200
Because of Kit?

117
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:11,600
That deal in Taiwan tomorrow,
you better not go.

118
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:15,900
If anything happens to me there,
you can take care of things here.

119
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:18,800
You will lead the Brothers
in the future.

120
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:23,700
I cannot do that.

121
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:28,100
Let Shing do it.
He looks just like a Godfather.

122
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,900
Mark, stop fooling around!

123
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:35,000
Ho, we can't do it without you.
I still have much to learn from you.

124
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:37,100
You really think you can learn this?

125
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:40,900
Don't think reading gangster books
will make you the boss.

126
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:46,200
Have you ever had a gun
pointed at your head?

127
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:48,100
No.

128
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:51,500
Twelve years ago...

129
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:54,200
Twelve years already.

130
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:59,000
For the first time, I went with Ho
to bring goods to Indonesia.

131
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:03,300
The Boss there treated us to
dinner in the night club.

132
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:07,800
I said something wrong,
displeasing the Boss...

133
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:10,400
...and there were two
guns pointing at my head.

134
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:13,300
I was forced to drink
a bottle of whisky.

135
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,900
I was so scared, I pissed my pants!

136
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:24,300
Fortunately, Ho drank the whole
bottle of whiskey for me.

137
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:30,300
But, it got even worse after that.
Four guns were pointed at my head.

138
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:36,500
You know what they made me drink?

139
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:38,900
Piss!

140
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:44,400
Drink piss in a night club!

141
00:13:57,900 --> 00:14:00,300
You want to learn? That's learning!

142
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:14,500
That's how we got through
our first job.

143
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:17,100
That's all in the past,
forget about it.

144
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:18,700
No.

145
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:28,100
I had never cried before.

146
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,200
That was the first time I cried.

147
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:40,800
I swore I'd never let anyone
point a gun at my head again!

148
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,100
How's that?

149
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:16,900
Careful!

150
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:21,700
Practice more with your sand bag.

151
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:25,200
I'm leaving tomorrow.

152
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:31,200
Disappearing as usual.

153
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:34,000
I'll be back soon.

154
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:39,100
While I'm away,
take good care of dad.

155
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:40,300
Sure.

156
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:43,800
Take care.

157
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:45,700
I will.

158
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:35,500
They're coming, move!
Hurry!

159
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:42,400
Careful, something's wrong.

160
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:46,700
- How do you know?
- Intuition.

161
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:55,900
- Mr. Sung, how are you?
- Where is Mr. Wang?

162
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,700
Sick. I'm his nephew.
He asked me to meet with you.

163
00:16:58,800 --> 00:16:59,900
How are you?

164
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,400
What's wrong with him?

165
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:04,700
Mr. Sung, let's go in first.

166
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,700
It's nothing serious. The police
are quite alert these days...

167
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:09,500
...and it's better for him to lay low.

168
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:11,600
- Have a cup of tea.
- Thanks.

169
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:13,600
Mr. Sung, this way please.

170
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:16,600
Come in, please, have a seat.

171
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:18,800
Let's not waste any more time.

172
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:26,000
Head quarters, please run a check
on a car numbered 1 0863 79.

173
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:38,500
Mr. Sung, you really keep your word.
When I was a kid, I admired you.

174
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:42,800
Can you believe someone is
giving me triple pay to kill you?

175
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,700
He's crazy, who does he think I am?

176
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:47,300
Let me get your money.

177
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:08,200
The police are coming!

178
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:08,600
Hello?

179
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:16,500
Uncle...

180
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:51,100
Sung Tse Ho has killed
some of our Brothers in Taiwan.

181
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:53,100
Now, the police are after him...

182
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:55,600
...and our boss is afraid he'll talk.

183
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:57,800
You're coming with me.

184
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:00,000
I don't want to use force.

185
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:01,700
You bastard!

186
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:08,900
If you hurt my son, I'll hunt
you down till the day I die!

187
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:10,800
Run, quickly run!

188
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,800
What are you doing? Don't! Don't!

189
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:19,100
No, don't!

190
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:24,900
Hello, hello? Wrong number!

191
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:33,600
Uncle, let's go!

192
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:38,700
Uncle!

193
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:41,900
Jackie, what's happening?

194
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,700
Kit, watch out!

195
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,500
Dad, don't come out!

196
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:13,000
Dad! Dad, don't!

197
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:32,200
Dad!

198
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:34,500
Dad!

199
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:44,900
Kit, you have to... forgive...
your brother...

200
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:14,000
Who betrayed me?

201
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:20,800
You?

202
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:24,700
Ho, if I betrayed you,
I wouldn't be here with you.

203
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:33,700
I don't know if I'll escape this time.

204
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:54,200
Ho, what are you doing?

205
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:56,600
- Ho...
- Surrendering.

206
00:23:56,700 --> 00:24:00,500
You can't go, Ho! Don't go.
You shouldn't go out there.

207
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:06,700
Ho, don't. Don't go out there!

208
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:08,000
Go! Run!

209
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:14,500
- Ho...
- Go!

210
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,800
I won't let you get caught.

211
00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:18,700
Gun shots are coming from inside!

212
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:21,000
- Go!
- I don't want to!

213
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:22,800
I'm telling you to go!

214
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:32,900
Stand up and don't move!
Don't move!

215
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:35,800
Put down the gun!

216
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:37,800
Put down the gun!

217
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:37,300
Brotherhood and ethics do not seem
to exist in our world anymore.

218
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:39,700
No one is trustworthy anymore.

219
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:42,300
Little Wang really is my nephew...

220
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:44,700
...but he has betrayed me as well.

221
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:48,100
He hooked up with
a new force in Hong Kong...

222
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:50,400
...and is trying to take over
my business.

223
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:54,500
Sung Tse Ho went down
because of him.

224
00:25:57,400 --> 00:26:00,400
On principle, we strictly
respect loyal friends.

225
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:03,200
And we won't forgive those
who betray us.

226
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:06,700
Hello?

227
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:08,900
Yes.

228
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:14,900
Tonight he will be at
Fung Lim Kok Restaurant.

229
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:22,200
Is there anything else
I can do to help?

230
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:24,000
Do you need some extra men?

231
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:31,400
Take care.

232
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:33,500
Thanks.

233
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,300
Captain!

234
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:18,300
Captain, this way.

235
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:29,800
I'm not scared.

236
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:32,700
My boss will bail me out.

237
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:35,200
Come on, drop your gun
and let's fight.

238
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:37,300
Then we'll see who is stronger.

239
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:41,200
5703!

240
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:44,500
- Yes, sir, what is it?
- Nothing.

241
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:55,300
Mr. Sung, what's up?

242
00:30:55,700 --> 00:30:58,100
Drug trafficking, resisting arrest,
assault.

243
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:00,400
- Not very smart.
- Take his statement.

244
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:03,700
Thanks!

245
00:31:18,300 --> 00:31:22,600
How's it going? It's a lot different
on the outside, isn't it?

246
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:24,300
Need a lift?

247
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:26,900
No, thanks.
We're going different directions.

248
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:29,000
I admire you.

249
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:33,000
Your loyalty. Three years in jail
and you haven't said a word.

250
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:35,200
What's crazy is while
you were inside...

251
00:31:35,300 --> 00:31:38,200
...the counterfeit money was
still being printed.

252
00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:40,100
Thanks!

253
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:44,300
I've retired.

254
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:51,500
Tell your friends...

255
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:55,500
...that case three years ago isn't
closed yet. I'm not giving up.

256
00:31:58,100 --> 00:32:01,200
Once a thief, it's not easy
to turn your life around.

257
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:05,600
Bye.

258
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:07,700
I won't be back.

259
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,000
Stop!

260
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:27,300
Kit, calm down!

261
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:36,800
Stop fighting!

262
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:48,300
Kit, stop it!

263
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:52,800
Don't let me see you again!

264
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:52,100
You the manager?

265
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:58,200
There's no manager here.

266
00:34:58,300 --> 00:35:00,200
I'm Ken. What do you want?

267
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:05,300
Ken, Uncle Chung from Taiwan
told me to come to you.

268
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:07,200
I was doing business in Taiwan...

269
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:09,800
You were in jail, not doing business.

270
00:35:12,900 --> 00:35:16,000
Uncle Chung asked me to
give you this letter in person.

271
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:21,000
Uncle Chung never has
anything good for me.

272
00:35:21,100 --> 00:35:23,200
But we are good old friends.

273
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:26,800
It's very difficult for an
ex-con to find a job.

274
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:30,000
Who wants to employ an ex-con?

275
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:35,900
No need to get depressed.

276
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:39,100
Everyone here has been in jail
before.

277
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:45,400
Some people like to adopt orphans...

278
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:48,000
...I like to take care of ex-convicts!

279
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:52,200
You see, I also have been
in prison before.

280
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:57,600
Colleagues...

281
00:35:58,100 --> 00:36:01,500
...this brother has just been
released.
Take good care of him.

282
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:04,800
- He is... you are...
- Sung Tse Ho.

283
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,300
Brother Ho!

284
00:36:06,700 --> 00:36:08,600
Oh no, just call me Ho.

285
00:36:11,100 --> 00:36:14,900
What are you doing? Trying to win
favors? Get back to work!

286
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:17,700
I'm not paying you to stand around!

287
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:21,300
- You got a driver's license?
- No.

288
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:24,000
I don't care if you get one or not.

289
00:36:24,100 --> 00:36:26,100
Just stick around here for now.

290
00:36:26,300 --> 00:36:29,300
- Ken, you're very kind.
- Don't worry about it.

291
00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:31,600
There is no boss here.

292
00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:35,000
Mark.

293
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:49,200
Why did you lie to me in your letters?

294
00:39:18,100 --> 00:39:22,000
Mark, even if both my two legs
were broken...

295
00:39:22,300 --> 00:39:24,700
...I could never make it up to you.

296
00:39:25,700 --> 00:39:31,000
Idiot, I just had some bad luck,
don't worry about it.

297
00:39:37,300 --> 00:39:39,100
I'm so happy to see you again!

298
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:41,800
It's been so long!

299
00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:43,800
You still look good.

300
00:39:47,300 --> 00:39:51,400
Mark, this is not our world anymore.

301
00:39:51,900 --> 00:39:53,700
Why are you still staying here?

302
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:07,700
I've waited for you for three years.
Three years, already!

303
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:13,700
We can start over again!

304
00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:38,300
Don't worry about me.
Look after your brother.

305
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:45,000
He's been following Shing everyday.
It's getting dangerous.

306
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:51,700
Anyhow, you two are real brothers.

307
00:40:57,500 --> 00:41:00,000
Kit, we all know you are very
capable.

308
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:05,000
In fact, I'd like you to be promoted,
but the higher-ups don't approve.

309
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:06,800
Why?

310
00:41:14,500 --> 00:41:16,400
This guy. You know him well.

311
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,300
We thought he had
disappeared for good.

312
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:26,000
But he was just released from jail
and is back in town.

313
00:41:26,100 --> 00:41:29,500
- He's with his old brothers again.
- How does that affect me?

314
00:41:29,700 --> 00:41:32,900
This is an investigation
of corruption in the police force.

315
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:36,300
And we can't have officers
with relatives in the crime world.

316
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:38,800
Now do you understand?

317
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:44,600
When I'm on duty...

318
00:41:45,100 --> 00:41:47,400
...I never think of him as my brother.

319
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:49,800
Kit...

320
00:41:50,900 --> 00:41:53,500
...you're off the Shing case.

321
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:55,500
I can't allow anything to ruin it.

322
00:42:01,900 --> 00:42:04,600
Mr. Sung, Shing is meeting
the Thai men tonight.

323
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,800
Brothers, cheers!

324
00:42:17,100 --> 00:42:19,500
- Mark, tell us some of your stories!
- Ho, you tell.

325
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:22,700
My Boss says the maximum price
is 1 8 million, no more.

326
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:24,000
Okay, okay.

327
00:42:24,100 --> 00:42:25,900
Sung Tse Ho's group is outside.

328
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:30,500
Beer, please.

329
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:34,300
Bye.

330
00:42:37,700 --> 00:42:40,000
Our Boss is over there.

331
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:47,400
Ho!

332
00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:51,000
You didn't let us know you're back!
What kind of a friend are you?

333
00:42:55,100 --> 00:42:57,700
We were once good brothers.
Right, Mark?

334
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:07,200
Ho, if you hadn't taken care of me,
I wouldn't be where I am today.

335
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:12,600
Don't be silly, you've worked hard.
I don't have that kind of power.

336
00:43:12,700 --> 00:43:15,900
It's thanks to Mark,
the position opened up for me.

337
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:20,000
Mark, should you ever need my help,
feel free to call me.

338
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:22,600
No more bullshit,
come on, let's drink!

339
00:43:22,700 --> 00:43:25,100
You really take good care
of your brothers!

340
00:43:26,300 --> 00:43:27,900
Come on, cheers!

341
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:35,200
This glass is for my leg!

342
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:38,900
Happy?

343
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:52,000
Ho, call me when you have time.
We have lots to discuss.

344
00:43:52,100 --> 00:43:53,300
I'm not interested.

345
00:43:53,900 --> 00:43:55,400
You will be.

346
00:43:56,200 --> 00:43:57,800
I have to go now.

347
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:07,100
Sung Tse Ho!

348
00:44:09,500 --> 00:44:11,000
Step outside with me.

349
00:44:23,300 --> 00:44:24,900
What are you doing?

350
00:44:27,300 --> 00:44:29,000
What did Shing tell you?

351
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:30,800
Just bullshit.

352
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:32,700
Don't lie to me!

353
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:34,900
Is it business or bullshit?

354
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:36,100
Really bullshit!

355
00:44:36,200 --> 00:44:38,200
- Are the goods arriving soon?
- I don't know.

356
00:44:38,600 --> 00:44:40,900
Where is it unloading? And when?

357
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:42,600
I don't know.

358
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:46,500
You don't know anything!
How can you be the boss?

359
00:44:48,500 --> 00:44:49,400
Kit...

360
00:44:50,300 --> 00:44:53,200
Don't ever call me Kit again,
say Officer!

361
00:45:01,900 --> 00:45:03,200
Officer...

362
00:45:05,500 --> 00:45:08,000
...I haven't been the Boss
for a long time.

363
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:17,100
Where do you work?

364
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:19,300
United Taxi Co.

365
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:23,500
A regular job?

366
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:28,400
Robbing with a taxi?

367
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:34,400
- Where do you live?
- United Taxi Co.

368
00:45:36,100 --> 00:45:38,500
Someone's willing to take in
a thief like you!

369
00:45:40,100 --> 00:45:42,700
You bastard! "Thief"?!
He has a name!

370
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:44,200
Just because you have a gun...

371
00:45:44,300 --> 00:45:46,500
Touch me again and I'll kill you,
you cripple!

372
00:45:49,900 --> 00:45:53,400
Kid, do not point a gun at my head.

373
00:45:53,500 --> 00:45:55,400
If you've got the guts, kill me!

374
00:45:55,700 --> 00:45:57,800
Shoot me... shoot me!

375
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:00,000
Kit...

376
00:46:00,500 --> 00:46:03,800
...Officer, I know I owe you a lot.

377
00:46:04,100 --> 00:46:06,300
Can you give me another chance?

378
00:46:06,500 --> 00:46:08,000
Give you another chance?

379
00:46:08,200 --> 00:46:10,500
I'm the one who needs
another chance!

380
00:46:11,800 --> 00:46:15,200
Because of you, I've lost
any chance of promotion!

381
00:46:15,900 --> 00:46:17,800
Because you're a gangster!

382
00:46:22,700 --> 00:46:24,700
You'd better not leave Hong Kong.

383
00:46:29,100 --> 00:46:31,200
I'll be watching you!

384
00:47:23,700 --> 00:47:25,600
Break time!

385
00:47:26,200 --> 00:47:27,900
Thank you, Ken!

386
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,700
Don't thank me, it's deducted
from your salary!

387
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:32,000
You're so mean!

388
00:47:32,100 --> 00:47:33,900
Hey, I've got a wife to support.
