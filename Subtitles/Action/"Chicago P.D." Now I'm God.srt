672
00:24:41,002 --> 00:24:42,009

- ate the payments?

- If you're gonna order
- enough chemo to kill someone,

678

From the fraud to these murders,

723
00:26:13,509 --> 00:26:15,000
and drawing that line--

724
00:26:15,002 --> 00:26:16,012
- Will unnecessarily

725
00:26:16,013 --> 00:26:17,020
prejudice the jury.

What happened to the patients

727
00:26:18,515 --> 00:26:20,004
in that case

728
00:26:20,006 --> 00:26:21,019
- is irrelevant
- in the current proceeding.

729
00:26:21,022 --> 00:26:23,017
- Irrelevant?
- Because the fraud victims

730
00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:25,011
Didn't die and my victims did?

731
00:26:25,013 --> 00:26:27,011
- Your Honor--
- Pull it back, Ms. Shelby.

732
00:26:27,014 --> 00:26:28,513
- Dr. Reybold murdered four

733
00:26:28,514 --> 00:26:30,013
women to cover up his fraud.

734
00:26:30,015 --> 00:26:32,013
The jury needs to hear this

735
00:26:32,015 --> 00:26:34,011
- so that they can understand
- the whole story.

736
00:26:34,014 --> 00:26:36,021
- But they'll be
- unduly prejudiced if they do.

737
00:26:36,024 --> 00:26:38,001
The bottom line is:

738
00:26:38,003 --> 00:26:39,010
the fraud victims

739
00:26:39,011 --> 00:26:40,016
can't testify.

740
00:26:48,023 --> 00:26:49,515
- Too prejudicial?

741
00:26:49,516 --> 00:26:51,005
Not relevant?

742
00:26:51,007 --> 00:26:52,013
- It was an uphill battle.

743
00:26:52,015 --> 00:26:53,509
- So not one of the victims

744
00:26:53,510 --> 00:26:55,001
can testify

745
00:26:55,003 --> 00:26:57,017
- that Reybold dosed
- our four women personally?

746
00:26:57,020 --> 00:26:59,009
- Three... the Medical Examiner

747
00:26:59,011 --> 00:27:00,516
just ruled Jessica Pope's death

748
00:27:00,517 --> 00:27:02,019
a suicide.

749
00:27:02,021 --> 00:27:04,013
- Put me on the stand.

750
00:27:04,015 --> 00:27:06,002
- Why?
- Do you have cancer?

751
00:27:06,005 --> 00:27:08,000
- I can walk a jury
- through all of this.

752
00:27:08,003 --> 00:27:09,011
- Sure, then Green
- will rip you a new one

753
00:27:09,012 --> 00:27:10,014
when she brings up Camille

754
00:27:10,016 --> 00:27:12,004
- and your motive
- for going after him.

755
00:27:12,007 --> 00:27:14,020
- I'm the lead investigator
- on this case.

756
00:27:14,023 --> 00:27:15,518
If you don't put me

757
00:27:15,519 --> 00:27:17,013
on the stand, she will,

758
00:27:17,015 --> 00:27:18,017
and you won't have

759
00:27:18,018 --> 00:27:19,018
set the table for it.

760
00:27:19,019 --> 00:27:21,002
Dana.

761
00:27:21,004 --> 00:27:22,008
- If you go off script

762
00:27:22,009 --> 00:27:23,010
one time,

763
00:27:23,012 --> 00:27:25,000
- you will lose this case
- for us.

764
00:27:25,003 --> 00:27:26,009
lt is too big a risk.

765
00:27:26,011 --> 00:27:28,010
- I'm putting Erin on
- to talk about the investigation.

766
00:27:28,013 --> 00:27:29,511
There is no way

767
00:27:29,512 --> 00:27:31,011
you are testifying.

768
00:27:37,020 --> 00:27:39,019
- If Denny's anything
- like his brother,

769
00:27:39,022 --> 00:27:40,513
He would have thrown that gun

770
00:27:40,514 --> 00:27:42,005
into the river like Roman said.

771
00:27:42,007 --> 00:27:44,000
- Denny's not like Ritchie
- though.

772
00:27:44,001 --> 00:27:45,016
- He's had the same job
- for ten years.

773
00:27:45,019 --> 00:27:47,017
- I mean, those parking tickets
- by Callie's house--

774
00:27:47,020 --> 00:27:49,021
- Only brush with the law
- he's ever had.

775
00:27:49,024 --> 00:27:51,017
I bet my life he took that gun

776
00:27:51,018 --> 00:27:53,011
to protect Ritchie--and Callie.

777
00:27:53,013 --> 00:27:55,007
- So go talk to him.
- I can't.

778
00:27:55,010 --> 00:27:57,008
- I have been
- in this guy's face before.

779
00:27:57,011 --> 00:27:59,021
- He won't roll for just me.
- I mean, I-I need...

780
00:27:59,024 --> 00:28:01,007
- Something
- to hold over him or--

781
00:28:01,010 --> 00:28:02,017
- I know what you need.

782
00:28:02,019 --> 00:28:04,007
- Wait, what?
- Me.

783
00:28:04,010 --> 00:28:06,017
- Bobby, watch the desk.
- I'm doing some field work.

784
00:28:06,020 --> 00:28:07,509
- Okay.

785
00:28:07,510 --> 00:28:08,999
- Are you coming or what?

786
00:28:09,001 --> 00:28:10,003
- Yeah.

787
00:28:16,011 --> 00:28:17,019
- Hey.

788
00:28:17,021 --> 00:28:20,002
'Sup, Denny?

789
00:28:20,004 --> 00:28:21,021
- This is harassment.

790
00:28:21,023 --> 00:28:22,522
- I'm gonna paint you

791
00:28:22,523 --> 00:28:24,019
a picture here, Denny.

792
00:28:24,021 --> 00:28:26,019
You lie to an officer,

793
00:28:26,021 --> 00:28:27,511
that's impeding

794
00:28:27,512 --> 00:28:28,999
an investigation.

795
00:28:29,001 --> 00:28:31,002
- You make a false statement
- on the record,

796
00:28:31,003 --> 00:28:32,018
- That's obstruction of
- justice.

797
00:28:32,021 --> 00:28:34,003
You keep a gun,

798
00:28:34,005 --> 00:28:36,000
- that's withholding evidence
- in a murder.

799
00:28:36,003 --> 00:28:37,014
- You brought your mom?

800
00:28:37,016 --> 00:28:39,018
- What, 'cause you couldn't prove
- I did any of that on your own?

801
00:28:39,021 --> 00:28:41,017
- We have proof that you
- drove your inebriated brother

802
00:28:41,020 --> 00:28:42,510
To a residence where he

803
00:28:42,511 --> 00:28:44,000
committed aggravated battery,

804
00:28:44,002 --> 00:28:45,021
- and then he threatened
- a police officer,

805
00:28:45,024 --> 00:28:47,008
Which led to his death.

806
00:28:47,010 --> 00:28:48,010
You know what you can

807
00:28:48,011 --> 00:28:49,009
be charged with?

808
00:28:49,011 --> 00:28:50,018
Accessory to murder.

809
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:52,000
- Whatever.

810
00:28:52,002 --> 00:28:53,013
- You're just saying things
- to try and trap me.

811
00:28:53,016 --> 00:28:54,020
- No, you will be charged

812
00:28:54,022 --> 00:28:55,514
as an accessory

813
00:28:55,515 --> 00:28:57,003
in your own brother's death.

814
00:28:57,005 --> 00:28:59,010
- Felony murder.
- That's two to five years.

815
00:28:59,013 --> 00:29:00,016
And not in county.

816
00:29:00,017 --> 00:29:01,020
Stateville.

817
00:29:01,022 --> 00:29:03,004
Come on, the way I see it,

818
00:29:03,006 --> 00:29:04,017
- you've been trying to help
- everybody else.

819
00:29:04,020 --> 00:29:06,013
- Your brother.
- Callie.

820
00:29:06,016 --> 00:29:07,516
If I were you, I'd start

821
00:29:07,517 --> 00:29:09,016
thinking about helping myself.

822
00:29:09,018 --> 00:29:11,014
- Where's the gun, Denny?

823
00:29:14,011 --> 00:29:15,513
- That gun turns up, the city

824
00:29:15,514 --> 00:29:17,013
does nothing for Callie.

825
00:29:17,015 --> 00:29:19,010
- She quit her job
- to take care of Andrew.

826
00:29:19,013 --> 00:29:21,013
Ritchie left her flat broke.

827
00:29:21,015 --> 00:29:24,013
She deserves better.

828
00:29:24,015 --> 00:29:25,999
- There's a reward

829
00:29:26,001 --> 00:29:28,019
- for information leading
- to the whereabouts of the gun.

830
00:29:28,022 --> 00:29:30,017
That reward could...

831
00:29:30,019 --> 00:29:31,520
take the turn of a check

832
00:29:31,521 --> 00:29:33,019
made out to anonymous.

833
00:29:33,021 --> 00:29:34,521
If you tell the detective

834
00:29:34,522 --> 00:29:36,019
in charge everything you saw--

835
00:29:36,021 --> 00:29:37,512
all of it--

836
00:29:37,513 --> 00:29:39,001
and that gun turns back up,

837
00:29:39,003 --> 00:29:40,511
well, that check could end up

838
00:29:40,512 --> 00:29:42,017
in the hands of a nice woman.

839
00:29:42,019 --> 00:29:45,007
25,000 dollars' worth.

840
00:29:45,009 --> 00:29:47,005
- And I wouldn't be charged
- with anything?

841
00:29:47,008 --> 00:29:49,005
- You're the grieving brother.

842
00:29:49,007 --> 00:29:50,014
Why would we charge you

843
00:29:50,015 --> 00:29:51,021
with anything?

844
00:29:57,004 --> 00:29:59,016
- In your review
- of Dr. Reybold's books,

845
00:29:59,019 --> 00:30:00,514
You found no evidence he

846
00:30:00,515 --> 00:30:02,009
billed any insurance companies

847
00:30:02,011 --> 00:30:03,506
for these treatments.

848
00:30:03,507 --> 00:30:04,998
- No.

849
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,507
- Well, who did pay

850
00:30:06,508 --> 00:30:08,012
for these treatments?

851
00:30:08,014 --> 00:30:09,509
- Dr. Reybold himself.

852
00:30:09,510 --> 00:30:11,002
From his personal account.

853
00:30:11,004 --> 00:30:12,006
- Personal.

854
00:30:12,008 --> 00:30:13,020
- Which allowed him
- to overdose patients--

855
00:30:13,023 --> 00:30:14,516
- Objection.

856
00:30:14,517 --> 00:30:16,010
- Overruled.

857
00:30:16,012 --> 00:30:17,514
- To overdose patients

858
00:30:17,515 --> 00:30:19,013
without raising a red flag

859
00:30:19,015 --> 00:30:20,514
with the insurance companies.

860
00:30:20,515 --> 00:30:22,010
- Yes.

861
00:30:22,012 --> 00:30:25,009
- No further questions.

862
00:30:25,011 --> 00:30:26,506
- Could Dr. Reybold

863
00:30:26,507 --> 00:30:27,998
have been helping patients

864
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,017
get the care they needed?

865
00:30:29,019 --> 00:30:30,512
For instance,

866
00:30:30,513 --> 00:30:32,002
if three patients came to him

867
00:30:32,004 --> 00:30:34,017
- and said they were having
- financial difficulties

868
00:30:34,020 --> 00:30:37,002
but wanted to stay alive...

869
00:30:37,004 --> 00:30:38,511
what kind of doctor might pay

870
00:30:38,512 --> 00:30:40,015
for those treatments himself?

871
00:30:40,017 --> 00:30:42,011
- A really remarkable one.

872
00:30:42,012 --> 00:30:44,004
That's for sure.

873
00:30:46,023 --> 00:30:48,012
- Thank you.

874
00:30:48,013 --> 00:30:49,998
That's all.

875
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,023
- My conversation
- with Dr. Reybold

876
00:30:51,026 --> 00:30:53,017
- Coupled with
- a look at his history

877
00:30:53,020 --> 00:30:55,017
led me to a clear diagnosis

878
00:30:55,018 --> 00:30:57,015
of psychopathy.

879
00:30:57,017 --> 00:31:00,013
The psychopathic mind

880
00:31:00,014 --> 00:31:03,007
lacks fear, remorse, empathy.

881
00:31:03,009 --> 00:31:05,506
In essence, it can't connect to

882
00:31:05,507 --> 00:31:08,001
or care about others.

883
00:31:08,003 --> 00:31:09,998
That's Dr. Reybold.

884
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,013
- But he's a doctor.

885
00:31:11,015 --> 00:31:12,510
Doesn't that suggest

886
00:31:12,511 --> 00:31:14,003
empathy or caring?

887
00:31:14,005 --> 00:31:15,504
- Well, you'd be shocked

888
00:31:15,505 --> 00:31:17,000
how many functional psychopaths

889
00:31:17,002 --> 00:31:18,008
are in the world,

890
00:31:18,010 --> 00:31:20,016
- you know, attracted to power,
- control.

891
00:31:20,019 --> 00:31:22,017
- Flaunting
- his success rates,

892
00:31:22,020 --> 00:31:23,520
the therapies only

893
00:31:23,521 --> 00:31:25,020
he can administer,

894
00:31:25,022 --> 00:31:27,022
belittling his patients

895
00:31:27,023 --> 00:31:29,019
to keep them under his control.

896
00:31:29,021 --> 00:31:30,520
"I'm the one

897
00:31:30,521 --> 00:31:32,016
with the medical degree, "

898
00:31:32,018 --> 00:31:34,016
he would say to his patients.

899
00:31:34,018 --> 00:31:36,011
- You know this how?

900
00:31:36,013 --> 00:31:37,016
- Because he told me.

901
00:31:37,018 --> 00:31:38,516
- I renew my objection.

902
00:31:38,517 --> 00:31:40,012
This entire conversation--

903
00:31:40,014 --> 00:31:42,010
- Was a spontaneous admission

904
00:31:42,011 --> 00:31:44,004
that has already been ruled on.

905
00:31:44,006 --> 00:31:46,000
- Agreed.
- Overruled.

906
00:31:46,003 --> 00:31:47,003
Continue, Ms. Shelby.

907
00:31:47,005 --> 00:31:48,506
- So Dr. Reybold

908
00:31:48,507 --> 00:31:50,004
would ask his patients

909
00:31:50,006 --> 00:31:51,999
if they had a medical degree?

910
00:31:52,001 --> 00:31:54,018
- And made sure they knew

911
00:31:54,020 --> 00:31:55,519
he was the only one

912
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:57,016
who could save them.

913
00:31:57,018 --> 00:31:58,516
Those are actual words

914
00:31:58,517 --> 00:32:00,012
from our conversation.

915
00:32:00,014 --> 00:32:03,010
- Thank you, Dr. Charles.

916
00:32:05,003 --> 00:32:06,511
- Well, let's talk

917
00:32:06,512 --> 00:32:08,017
about that conversation.

918
00:32:08,019 --> 00:32:09,513
Was it at your office?

919
00:32:09,514 --> 00:32:11,005
- No.

920
00:32:11,007 --> 00:32:12,009
- At the court?

921
00:32:12,010 --> 00:32:13,010
Ordered by a judge?

922
00:32:13,011 --> 00:32:15,007
- Nope.
- Did Dr. Reybold know

923
00:32:15,008 --> 00:32:16,021
he was being interviewed?

924
00:32:16,023 --> 00:32:17,514
- As I said before,

925
00:32:17,515 --> 00:32:19,003
it was not an interview.

926
00:32:19,005 --> 00:32:20,504
lt was two doctors striking up

927
00:32:20,505 --> 00:32:22,001
a conversation.

00:32:22,003 --> 00:32:24,007
- Where did this conversation
- take place?

929
00:32:24,010 --> 00:32:25,507
- In a coffee shop.

930
00:32:25,508 --> 00:32:27,005
- Near your house?

931
00:32:27,007 --> 00:32:28,008
- No.

932
00:32:28,009 --> 00:32:29,009
- Your office?

933
00:32:29,010 --> 00:32:31,006
- No.
- In fact,

934
00:32:31,009 --> 00:32:32,515
it was 8 miles

935
00:32:32,516 --> 00:32:34,023
from either of those places.

936
00:32:36,003 --> 00:32:37,018
- Didn't measure.

937
00:32:37,020 --> 00:32:39,011
- Do you know
- how many coffee shops

938
00:32:39,014 --> 00:32:40,507
Are between your house

939
00:32:40,508 --> 00:32:42,001
or office and there?

940
00:32:42,003 --> 00:32:43,017
- I don't.

941
00:32:43,019 --> 00:32:45,008
- 37.

942
00:32:45,010 --> 00:32:48,006
37 other coffee shops,

943
00:32:48,008 --> 00:32:49,504
and you rolled

944
00:32:49,505 --> 00:32:50,998
into this particular one,

945
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,016
- two blocks
- from the defendant's house?

946
00:32:53,019 --> 00:32:54,512
To stalk him?

947
00:32:54,513 --> 00:32:56,006
- Objection.

948
00:32:56,008 --> 00:32:57,014
- Sustained.

949
00:32:57,016 --> 00:32:58,017
- Were you paid

950
00:32:58,018 --> 00:32:59,018
by the prosecution

951
00:32:59,019 --> 00:33:01,010
- for your services,
- Dr. Charles?

952
00:33:01,013 --> 00:33:02,011
- I was not.

953
00:33:02,013 --> 00:33:03,507
- You're an unpaid agent

954
00:33:03,508 --> 00:33:05,000
of the police.

955
00:33:05,002 --> 00:33:06,505
- No one told me

956
00:33:06,506 --> 00:33:08,005
to speak with Dr. Reybold.

957
00:33:08,007 --> 00:33:11,998
I walked into that coffee shop

958
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,010
and I saw this...

959
00:33:14,012 --> 00:33:16,008
doctor...

960
00:33:17,014 --> 00:33:18,015
And my curiosity

961
00:33:18,016 --> 00:33:19,016
got the best of me.

962
00:33:19,017 --> 00:33:21,021

Dr. Charles?

967
00:33:29,001 --> 00:33:31,005
Perhaps at a bar called Molly's?

968
00:33:31,007 --> 00:33:32,504
- I have.

969
00:33:32,505 --> 00:33:33,999
- So they're friends of yours?

970
00:33:34,001 --> 00:33:36,017
- My report on Dr. Reybold
- is an unbiased analy--

971
00:33:36,020 --> 00:33:38,015
- That wasn't the question.

972
00:33:38,017 --> 00:33:40,019
- I know them through work

973
00:33:40,021 --> 00:33:42,013
and would be very proud

974
00:33:42,014 --> 00:33:44,003

Comparing notes.

1002
00:34:40,002 --> 00:34:41,003
We know this from

00:34:41,004 --> 00:34:42,002
their phone records.

1004
00:34:42,004 --> 00:34:43,509
After their December 10th

1005
00:34:43,510 --> 00:34:45,013
meeting with Dr. Reybold,

1006
00:34:45,015 --> 00:34:47,017
- they agreed
- to an experimental treatment

1007
00:34:47,020 --> 00:34:49,009
which, in actuality,

1008
00:34:49,011 --> 00:34:51,011
was simply

1009
00:34:51,012 --> 00:34:53,008
twice the usual dose of chemo.

1010
00:34:53,010 --> 00:34:54,516
The following week, he upped it

1011
00:34:54,517 --> 00:34:56,020
to three times the amount.

1012
00:34:56,022 --> 00:34:58,023
- By the time they wound up
- in the hospital,

1013
00:34:58,026 --> 00:35:00,005
it was at seven times.

1014
00:35:00,007 --> 00:35:01,505
- Because they confronted him

1015
00:35:01,506 --> 00:35:03,000
about what he did,

1016
00:35:03,002 --> 00:35:04,017
- and he was afraid
- of being exposed.

1017
00:35:04,020 --> 00:35:05,510
- Objection.

1018
00:35:05,511 --> 00:35:07,000
Counsel is testifying.

1019
00:35:07,002 --> 00:35:09,009
- Sustained.

1020
00:35:09,011 --> 00:35:11,003
- In your investigation,

1021
00:35:11,005 --> 00:35:12,012
did you find it suspicious

1022
00:35:12,014 --> 00:35:13,510
three patients met with

1023
00:35:13,511 --> 00:35:15,003
the doctor one day--

1024
00:35:15,005 --> 00:35:16,005
- Objection.

1025
00:35:16,007 --> 00:35:18,010
- No one knows what transpired
- in this meeting.

1026
00:35:18,013 --> 00:35:19,517
- That's because everyone in

1027
00:35:19,518 --> 00:35:21,021
that meeting besides Dr. Reybold

1028
00:35:21,023 --> 00:35:23,010
is dead or in a coma.

1029
00:35:23,012 --> 00:35:25,006
- You Honor.
- One more time,

1030
00:35:25,009 --> 00:35:27,018
and you're in contempt.

1031
00:35:27,020 --> 00:35:30,005
- [sighs]

1032
00:35:30,007 --> 00:35:31,512
Could the amounts the patients

1033
00:35:31,513 --> 00:35:33,014
received have been lab mistakes?

1034
00:35:33,016 --> 00:35:34,516
- No, Dr. Reybold's signature

1035
00:35:34,517 --> 00:35:36,014
was on every order.

1036
00:35:36,016 --> 00:35:38,012
- Well, what about
- a dosing error?

1037
00:35:38,015 --> 00:35:40,006
- His staffer testified

1038
00:35:40,008 --> 00:35:41,507
that Dr. Reybold personally

1039
00:35:41,508 --> 00:35:43,004
administered those doses.

1040
00:35:43,006 --> 00:35:44,018
- But the staffer cut a deal.

1041
00:35:44,020 --> 00:35:46,003
- That doesn't mean
- it wasn't the truth.

1042
00:35:46,006 --> 00:35:47,006
- Objection.

1043

lmproper opinion.

1044
00:35:48,008 --> 00:35:49,014

1045
00:35:49,016 --> 00:35:50,016
- What about any

1046
00:35:50,017 --> 00:35:51,015
other witnesses who--

1047
00:35:51,017 --> 00:35:53,002
- Asked and answered.

1048
00:35:53,004 --> 00:35:54,007
- Yes, Ms. Shelby,

1049
00:35:54,008 --> 00:35:55,008
move on.

1050
00:35:55,010 --> 00:35:57,007
- Your Honor, someone has to

1051
00:35:57,008 --> 00:35:59,002
speak for these victims.

1052
00:35:59,004 --> 00:36:00,009
- You don't speak.

1053
00:36:00,010 --> 00:36:01,012
You ask questions.

1054
00:36:01,014 --> 00:36:03,008
- And if nobody else
- saw the doctor dosing--

1055
00:36:03,011 --> 00:36:06,011
- Someone else did.

1056
00:36:06,013 --> 00:36:09,002
Me.

1057
00:36:09,004 --> 00:36:10,507
I saw Dr. Reybold

1058
00:36:10,508 --> 00:36:12,007
dose a patient.

1059
00:36:12,009 --> 00:36:14,011
My wife.

1060
00:36:14,013 --> 00:36:15,509
I saw Dr. Reybold

1061
00:36:15,510 --> 00:36:17,002

1062
00:36:17,004 --> 00:36:18,511

1063
00:36:18,512 --> 00:36:20,015
under Dr. Reybold's care

1064
00:36:20,017 --> 00:36:22,019
six years ago.

1065
00:36:31,002 --> 00:36:32,002
.

1066
00:36:32,003 --> 00:36:32,017
- Sergeant Voight--

1067
00:36:32,018 --> 00:36:32,019
- I'm a witness.

1068
00:36:33,016 --> 00:36:36,017
I saw him dose a patient.

1069
00:36:38,008 --> 00:36:39,011
- The State has

1070
00:36:39,012 --> 00:36:40,012
no further questions

1071
00:36:40,013 --> 00:36:42,008
for this witness.

1072
00:36:43,023 --> 00:36:46,008
- Well, I have a few.

1073
00:36:50,006 --> 00:36:52,010
Losing your wife to cancer

1074
00:36:52,012 --> 00:36:53,509
must have been very painful,

1075
00:36:53,510 --> 00:36:55,005
Sergeant.

1076
00:36:58,010 --> 00:36:59,515
Can you talk

1077
00:36:59,516 --> 00:37:01,019
about your wife's illness?

1078
00:37:07,014 --> 00:37:08,517
- Camille was referred

1079
00:37:08,518 --> 00:37:10,018
to Dr. Reybold

1080
00:37:10,020 --> 00:37:11,521
when her ovarian cancer

1081
00:37:11,522 --> 00:37:13,020
returned.

1082
00:37:13,022 --> 00:37:16,022
He recommended

1083
00:37:16,023 --> 00:37:19,020
an aggressive course

1084
00:37:19,022 --> 00:37:21,018
and then a second round

1085
00:37:21,019 --> 00:37:23,012
when that didn't get it all.

1086
00:37:23,014 --> 00:37:26,008
She was cold all the time...

1087
00:37:28,008 --> 00:37:31,015
Couldn't keep food down.

1088
00:37:31,017 --> 00:37:33,016
Memory went in and out.

1089
00:37:33,017 --> 00:37:35,012
She...

1090
00:37:35,014 --> 00:37:38,007
She was depressed.

1091
00:37:41,011 --> 00:37:42,515
She fought as hard

1092
00:37:42,516 --> 00:37:44,019
as she could, but...

1093
00:37:45,019 --> 00:37:47,021
- She sounds brave.

1094
00:37:50,014 --> 00:37:52,017
- She was.

1095
00:37:52,019 --> 00:37:54,009
- [sighs]

00:37:54,011 --> 00:37:56,005
You're still in mourning

over your wife's death.

1098
00:37:59,007 --> 00:38:01,022
- Isn't that what this is
- about?

1099
00:38:01,025 --> 00:38:03,011
- No.

1100
00:38:04,023 --> 00:38:07,001
- How gratifying would it be

1101
00:38:07,003 --> 00:38:10,013
to help convict Dr. Reybold?

1102
00:38:10,015 --> 00:38:12,012
- It would be very gratifying.

1103
00:38:12,014 --> 00:38:13,014
- No further questions.

1104
00:38:13,015 --> 00:38:14,013
- For all his victims.

1105
00:38:14,015 --> 00:38:16,001
- I said no further questions.

1106
00:38:16,003 --> 00:38:17,503
You answered exactly

1107
00:38:17,504 --> 00:38:19,003
as I expected you to.

1108
00:38:20,020 --> 00:38:22,013
- Redirect?

1109
00:38:24,002 --> 00:38:26,014
What other victims

1110
00:38:26,016 --> 00:38:27,018
are you referring to,

1111
00:38:27,019 --> 00:38:28,019
Sergeant Voight?

1112
00:38:28,020 --> 00:38:30,000
- Objection.

1113
00:38:30,002 --> 00:38:31,003
- Ms. Green

1114
00:38:31,004 --> 00:38:32,002
questioned my witness

1115
00:38:32,004 --> 00:38:34,008
