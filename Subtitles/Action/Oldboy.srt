- I...
- You had no right!

Who the hell are you?

342
00:41:05,122 --> 00:41:08,062
Your friend, Chucky, called me,
because you did not feel well.

00:41:08,081 --> 00:41:11,717
- I got it right. So get out.
- You have it not good.

What are you doing here?

345
00:41:14,187 --> 00:41:16,922
I'm sorry,
that I read your letters.

346
00:41:18,727 --> 00:41:21,473
- Did you call the police?
- No.

347
00:41:21,493 --> 00:41:23,552
Why?

348
00:41:23,587 --> 00:41:26,242
- I believe in you.
- Why?

349
00:41:26,982 --> 00:41:30,975
I believe that you have been
locked up for some time.

350
00:41:33,329 --> 00:41:36,931
- And you want to be a father to your daughter.
- Do not touch me.

351
00:41:37,051 --> 00:41:41,642
- And you want to prove your love.
- Do not touch me, I said.

352
00:41:44,672 --> 00:41:48,812
What if I think you know too much?
Now that you know about the letters.

353
00:41:49,951 --> 00:41:53,166
What if I think
I ought to kill you?

354
00:41:55,262 --> 00:41:58,026
So I'd probably be dead.

358

Or I can put you in touch
with people who can.

359
00:42:22,384 --> 00:42:26,203
There are social workers, lawyers,
and a few police officers, I trust.

360
00:42:26,224 --> 00:42:28,874
No, I do not need your help.

- Because he's happy.

The person who called me,
do not know what it means.

368
00:43:24,841 --> 00:43:27,354
- Now what?
- I need the Yellow Pages.

369
00:43:27,856 --> 00:43:31,935
- Where have all the phone boxes?
- Hold on, Joe. What are you looking for?

370
00:43:31,956 --> 00:43:35,840
A restaurant.
It's called something with "Dragon."

I never ask after their name,
and they tell it either.

- He should be at the hospital.

- It will not go.
- Why not?

462
00:57:19,407 --> 00:57:23,479
Someone tried to kill him.
Should not we call the police?

463
00:57:23,513 --> 00:57:26,847
- I'm asking you not to.
- He is not a herrelřs dog -

464
00:57:26,882 --> 00:57:29,478
- or a bird with a broken wing.

465
00:57:29,598 --> 00:57:32,492
I know you love the hĺblřse coincidence, -

and fall back into an old pattern.

Do you believe it?

Turn yourself just a little.
Sorry.

Bleeding has stopped.
It's a good sign.

474
00:58:35,012 --> 00:58:38,914
I can not tell you or Marie,
what I should do.

475
00:58:39,205 --> 00:58:42,642
But I can tell you one thing.
She has gone over much.

476
00:58:42,662 --> 00:58:48,096
If it is something that she does not need
it is to get hurt.

477
00:58:50,741 --> 00:58:53,366
Please do not hurt her.

478
00:59:00,969 --> 00:59:03,785
He likes you.

479
00:59:07,673 --> 00:59:10,020
Can you too like him?

480
00:59:10,990 --> 00:59:14,395
No, it's been a long time.

481
00:59:16,632 --> 00:59:19,431
He still likes you.

You should go. Come on. Go.

Come on.

487
01:00:04,998 --> 01:00:09,359

KRL down!

496
01:01:08,497 --> 01:01:10,165
KRL so down!

497
01:01:14,441 --> 01:01:19,587
If you kill me, you die within a
seconds. Without knowing why.

498
01:01:23,718 --> 01:01:25,047
Stop then!

499
01:01:25,771 --> 01:01:32,270
I have your daughter. If you want to see her
alive again, we should proceed without violence.

500
01:01:34,106 --> 01:01:37,174
Can I see your list?

501
01:01:44,915 --> 01:01:45,701
No.

502
01:01:46,632 --> 01:01:49,520
It is not beneficial to you.
Trust me.

503
01:01:50,593 --> 01:01:53,457
I have a suggestion, Joseph.

504
01:01:54,011 --> 01:01:57,722
If you accept and through with,
you will be amply rewarded.

505
01:01:58,409 --> 01:02:04,190
First with a video of your wife's
rape and murder.

506
01:02:04,637 --> 01:02:05,988
Donna Hawthorne.

507
01:02:07,047 --> 01:02:10,080
- Look at the camera.
- No!

508
01:02:10,850 --> 01:02:16,003
I do not see it.
Turn it off.

509
01:02:16,507 --> 01:02:17,495
Say: "Farewell."

510
01:02:20,432 --> 01:02:24,188
- Turn it off!
- Well.

511
01:02:24,506 --> 01:02:25,999
Second gets you:

512
01:02:27,299 --> 01:02:31,729
My hĺndskrevne confession
of this deed.

513
01:02:32,571 --> 01:02:35,893
And your bortfřrelse
and indespćrring.

514
01:02:36,809 --> 01:02:40,660
Third...
And it is my favorite -

515
01:02:41,503 --> 01:02:44,994
- $ 20 million in diamonds.

516
01:02:46,020 --> 01:02:52,039
Finally, and again only in case of
that you manage -

517
01:02:53,483 --> 01:02:58,108
- I'm gonna shoot me a bullet in your head.
And you are welcome to watch.

518
01:02:58,385 --> 01:03:01,083
Answer two questions.

519
01:03:02,006 --> 01:03:05,569
First of all:
Who am I?

520
01:03:06,215 --> 01:03:12,041
Second:
Why I entertained you indespćrret 20 years?

521
01:03:12,587 --> 01:03:17,770
Answers to both questions
satisfactory in -

522
01:03:18,758 --> 01:03:22,393
- 46 hours from now, you won.

523
01:03:22,794 --> 01:03:26,894
Refuse to participate, this corresponds
to fall short of the target.

524
01:03:27,087 --> 01:03:29,911
You remain a fugitive of the law.

525
01:03:30,032 --> 01:03:35,704
'll Get no reward or sjćlefred.
And I'll kill your daughter.

526
01:03:36,946 --> 01:03:41,627
If you, or someone you know
go to the police or warn Mia -

527
01:03:42,048 --> 01:03:44,830
- will be the impact gruopvćkkende.
Especially for her.

528
01:03:44,831 --> 01:03:48,286
If you doubt my determination,
or my influence -

529
01:03:48,407 --> 01:03:51,158
- I would suggest that you quickly
possible'll take to your friend Marie.

530
01:03:53,105 --> 01:03:56,196
This is a live broadcast.
What is your answer?

531
01:03:56,317 --> 01:03:57,827
Yes or no?

532
01:04:00,699 --> 01:04:01,770
Yes!

533
01:04:01,892 --> 01:04:06,297
Her address is 629 Cooper Street
You'd better hurry.

534
01:04:16,957 --> 01:04:18,393
Marie!

535
01:04:26,060 --> 01:04:27,593
Good evening, Joe.

536
01:04:30,114 --> 01:04:36,248
I should just enjoy myself with her.
But now that you are here -

537
01:04:37,075 --> 01:04:40,969
- bitch can wait.

538
01:04:41,481 --> 01:04:47,785
Throw him up on the table.
Up with the idiot.

539
01:04:47,906 --> 01:04:50,301
Hold him tight.

540
01:04:54,780 --> 01:04:58,849
The last one made me lose my temper
-

541
01:05:01,458 --> 01:05:08,684
- I tracked down and tortured in
16 days, according to the rules.

542
01:05:08,803 --> 01:05:11,748
But compared to what
I will do with you -

543
01:05:11,867 --> 01:05:16,128
- this corresponds to an ant
fuck an elephant.

544
01:05:29,415 --> 01:05:30,396
Yes?

545
01:05:31,546 --> 01:05:36,237
I'm sorry, but that's not possible.
A godtgřrelse are in order.

546
01:05:37,051 --> 01:05:41,838
Well, you gave me the address,
and I am extremely grateful.

547
01:05:43,198 --> 01:05:47,267
No, you can not offer me anything,
who can hold me...

548
01:05:48,130 --> 01:05:50,235
I have to go to the door?

549
01:05:53,371 --> 01:05:56,316
Hold him tight.

550
01:06:03,518 --> 01:06:04,930
Cortesz?

551
01:06:05,386 --> 01:06:06,631
Cortesz.

552
01:06:08,306 --> 01:06:09,311
Let me get a little space.

553
01:06:13,955 --> 01:06:16,181
Maybe I can still...

554
01:06:17,809 --> 01:06:22,237
Thank you for your generosity.
And I thank you -

555
01:06:22,356 --> 01:06:28,345
- To vćrdsćtte my sacrifice.
And a good evening to you too.

556
01:06:31,242 --> 01:06:34,088
You're lucky pig, asshole.
Are you aware of it?

557
01:06:35,390 --> 01:06:38,067
Let's get out.

558
01:06:55,161 --> 01:06:56,850
It's okay, Marie.

559
01:07:01,094 --> 01:07:05,265
It's okay.

560
01:07:05,266 --> 01:07:07,566
Sorry... sorry.

561
01:08:07,994 --> 01:08:10,574
One of my friends live nearby.

562
01:08:12,046 --> 01:08:15,374
I can sleep with her.
I do not feel safe anymore.

563
01:08:24,152 --> 01:08:25,044
Hello?

564
01:08:28,206 --> 01:08:30,739
Every time he calls,
playing the same tune.

565
01:08:47,017 --> 01:08:51,204
Evergreen Academy.
Ring any bells?

566
01:08:52,869 --> 01:08:55,642
The private school I went to.

567
01:09:00,369 --> 01:09:02,708
It was weird. I can not find anything.

568
01:09:05,264 --> 01:09:08,857
Here is something.

569
01:09:09,518 --> 01:09:13,546
- Who is Edwina Burke?
- She was my school principal.

570
01:09:28,883 --> 01:09:32,296
I drank fřrhen. Very much.

571
01:09:34,418 --> 01:09:38,252
I did too.
On top of a lot of shit.

572
01:09:40,857 --> 01:09:44,788
This evening, I was close on
to take a sprřjte again.

573
01:09:48,044 --> 01:09:49,925
I'm glad you're here.

574
01:10:18,596 --> 01:10:22,913
Hello, you miss Burke?
Edwina Burke from Evergreen Academy?

575
01:10:23,347 --> 01:10:27,712
Can we talk for a
of your former students?

576
01:10:28,218 --> 01:10:29,305
Joe Doucett.

577
01:10:30,609 --> 01:10:33,000
- Come on in..
- I hope not to bother you.

578
01:10:33,120 --> 01:10:37,991
I was making tea.
Sit down though.

579
01:10:42,048 --> 01:10:44,052
Joseph Doucett?

580
01:10:45,067 --> 01:10:48,809
- Remember him?
- Of course.

581
01:10:49,365 --> 01:10:55,760
He is the only killer in the
motley bunch of students.

582
01:10:56,147 --> 01:11:00,254
And if I told you
Joe Doucett is innocent?

583
01:11:00,662 --> 01:11:04,382
The fact that another man killed her.
One he knew from Evergreen.

584
01:11:04,913 --> 01:11:09,018
- Tell me first who you are.
- I'm sorry.

585
01:11:09,139 --> 01:11:13,559
My name is Marie Sebastian.
Have you heard about the innocence project?

586
01:11:14,099 --> 01:11:18,060
They work dreamed convicts.

587
01:11:18,664 --> 01:11:21,876
Joseph disappeared 20 years ago.

588
01:11:23,059 --> 01:11:24,653
Excuse me for a moment.

589
01:11:45,227 --> 01:11:46,918
Do you believe that it was not he?

590
01:11:47,038 --> 01:11:50,829
There have sprung up evidence that suggests
that he was blamed for it.

591
01:11:51,844 --> 01:11:54,391
It comes as a great relief.

592
01:11:54,510 --> 01:11:57,654
He was a really nice guy.

593
01:11:59,312 --> 01:12:03,181
Donna adored him, but he
vćrdsatte neither it or her.

594
01:12:03,300 --> 01:12:06,545
He was tall thoughts about themselves.

595
01:12:06,929 --> 01:12:08,371
But others are not.

596
01:12:08,756 --> 01:12:11,759
He could even be malicious.

597
01:12:12,552 --> 01:12:15,508
Always with a smile, as if the
was a joke.

598
01:12:15,999 --> 01:12:19,675
I saw him a bit like a
lost soul.

599
01:12:22,534 --> 01:12:26,643
You nćvnte the killer
was another student?

600
01:12:26,763 --> 01:12:29,623
- I suspect that Joe had enemies?
- Yes, many.

601
01:12:30,008 --> 01:12:35,029
But to do something sĺdant would krćve
something quite unusual...

602
01:12:35,697 --> 01:12:37,908
Yes, but was there any?

603
01:12:38,028 --> 01:12:41,176
Can you get on one?

604
01:12:41,657 --> 01:12:44,131
I can not think of one.

605
01:12:44,829 --> 01:12:47,904
I drove past your old school.

606
01:12:48,577 --> 01:12:51,244
- What happened to it?
- They took it from me.

607
01:12:51,363 --> 01:12:53,863
My father built the school.
Stone on stone.

608
01:12:54,296 --> 01:12:59,689
Board sold it to a company.
Since that time the gates closed.

609
01:13:01,215 --> 01:13:06,543
Everything is still there. Records, files.
All of the school's history.

610
01:13:07,222 --> 01:13:10,830
- But it has left.
- Goodbye.

611
01:13:11,169 --> 01:13:14,100
Marie?
At the beginning of our conversation?

612
01:13:14,220 --> 01:13:18,492
There you said that Joe is innocent.
Not "was innocent."

613
01:13:19,678 --> 01:13:21,858
I assumed he was dead.

614
01:13:25,491 --> 01:13:26,726
Thank you.

615
01:13:35,905 --> 01:13:38,036
Did you go to school here?

616
01:13:38,735 --> 01:13:40,309
It's been a long time.

617
01:13:43,724 --> 01:13:46,340
Let's get back tonight.

618
01:14:21,645 --> 01:14:24,133
- Hello?
- I have no idea who it is.

619
01:14:24,253 --> 01:14:26,244
The name tells me nothing.

620
01:14:26,365 --> 01:14:30,290
- What about your classmates?
- Oh, I have not seen in years.

621
01:14:30,411 --> 01:14:35,384
As if assholes want to talk to me.
In addition to you, I hated every one.

622
01:14:35,505 --> 01:14:38,179
- Sorry, Joe.
- Do not mention it.

623
01:14:38,300 --> 01:14:42,371
I'm trying to figure something out.
I'll call again.

624
01:14:51,990 --> 01:14:54,072
We should change your dressing.

625
01:14:57,457 --> 01:14:59,857
- Can I help you?
- Yes, thank you.

626

There is no connection to the number.
Please leave a message.

628
01:16:33,448 --> 01:16:37,031
Joe, it's Chucky.
Call back when you hear this.

629
01:16:37,151 --> 01:16:41,080
It is not about him. It is about
her. Whore. Do you remember her?

630
01:16:41,200 --> 01:16:43,249
Joe, call me.

631
01:16:49,121 --> 01:16:52,793
Chucky!

632
01:17:05,173 --> 01:17:07,226
You called her a whore.

633
01:17:08,066 --> 01:17:10,379
You called her a whore!

634
01:17:11,883 --> 01:17:14,949
Whore! Whore! Whore!

635
01:18:03,167 --> 01:18:07,328

In preparation at the new skoleĺr -

01:18:14,853 --> 01:18:18,753
- I do pay attention on a student
from Pryce family.

638
01:18:19,128 --> 01:18:21,877
Amanda Pryce.
Are you right for her?

639
01:18:22,715 --> 01:18:26,707
- 1986.
- I found her.

640
01:18:27,459 --> 01:18:29,730
Here. Amanda Pryce.

641
01:18:30,164 --> 01:18:34,908
We have been made opmćrksomt on,

642
01:18:40,837 --> 01:18:42,370
Do you remember her?

643
01:18:48,096 --> 01:18:49,919
Wait.

644
01:18:50,038 --> 01:18:53,313
Young women must be on their place.

645
01:18:53,433 --> 01:18:56,392
- Give it to me again.
- Joe, let her alone.

646
01:18:56,513 --> 01:18:59,006
- If she wants to go, let her go.
- Jonna, shut the fuck up.

647
01:18:59,126 --> 01:19:02,080
They are damn sexy.

648
01:19:02,366 --> 01:19:05,326
You're fucking sick.

649
01:19:06,490 --> 01:19:08,125
Here, your břsserřv.

650
01:19:11,903 --> 01:19:14,319
- Joe, let her come over.
- Look at her.

651
01:19:15,867 --> 01:19:17,527
She is scared shitless.

652
01:19:18,877 --> 01:19:20,154
Let her past.

653
01:19:25,340 --> 01:19:26,975
She has so much deserved it.

654
01:19:28,114 --> 01:19:29,588
She allows one to talk to me like that?

655
01:19:29,709 --> 01:19:31,682
I do not care. I'm full.

01:21:43,355 --> 01:21:46,468
That's him. The man who was in the greenhouse
the pĺgćldende evening.

668
01:21:47,961 --> 01:21:50,222
It was her father.

669
01:22:04,619 --> 01:22:07,004
Chucky. Where are you?

670
01:22:08,426 --> 01:22:09,439
Call me.

671
01:22:49,686 --> 01:22:52,563
If he kills you,
you will never see your daughter.

672
01:22:52,984 --> 01:22:56,924
And you kill him,
you still will not see your daughter.

673
01:23:00,187 --> 01:23:01,682
Pull over not up to him.

674
01:23:04,177 --> 01:23:05,560
I have no choice.

675
01:23:06,426 --> 01:23:07,821
Please.

676
01:23:10,436 --> 01:23:12,672
I do not want you drive.

677
01:23:14,846 --> 01:23:16,266
Listen.

678
01:23:17,600 --> 01:23:19,738
Promise me that you are not going anywhere.

679
01:23:23,568 --> 01:23:26,966
You do not call someone
and you do not talk to anybody.

680
01:23:38,809 --> 01:23:40,550
Do you expect here?

681
01:23:44,372 --> 01:23:45,645
Promise?

682
01:23:48,107 --> 01:23:48,996
Yes?

683
01:24:11,360 --> 01:24:14,276
- Here's Tom Melby.
- You listen to me.

684
01:24:14,635 --> 01:24:17,847
- Has Marie right?
- Write my instructions down.

685
01:24:23,176 --> 01:24:25,853
I am ready.
Where am I going?

686
01:24:45,127 --> 01:24:46,595
Where is Mia?

687
01:25:15,833 --> 01:25:17,054
Where is Mia?

688
01:25:22,866 --> 01:25:23,581
There.

689
01:25:27,303 --> 01:25:28,796
Where is she?

690
01:25:30,844 --> 01:25:31,781
Here.

691
01:25:33,299 --> 01:25:35,841
Right around here,
to be exact.

692
01:25:39,017 --> 01:25:43,841
But you do not see her,
until I have your answer.

693
01:25:44,927 --> 01:25:48,510
Please remove the knife,
or she is going to pay for it.

694
01:25:53,014 --> 01:25:54,667
Your reward.

695
01:25:55,294 --> 01:25:57,836
As I said, I am a man,
that stands by its word.

696
01:25:59,132 --> 01:26:03,019
- Well. Who am I?
- Adrian Doyle Pryce.

697
01:26:03,660 --> 01:26:06,194
Why do I spćrret you for 20 years?

698
01:26:06,314 --> 01:26:08,464
You think I'm responsible
for your family's dead.

699
01:26:08,584 --> 01:26:10,945
- Be more specific.
- I saw your sister.

700
01:26:11,401 --> 01:26:14,786
With a man.
The in greenhouse.

701
01:26:14,906 --> 01:26:17,501
They fucked!

702
01:26:19,067 --> 01:26:21,511
- It told you all, right?
- Jo.

703
01:26:23,371 --> 01:26:28,442
I told Donna and Chucky.
And most of Evergreene.

704
01:26:30,404 --> 01:26:32,809
Gossip are quick to five chickens.

705
01:26:32,930 --> 01:26:36,868
Amanda is a whore!

706
01:26:37,116 --> 01:26:40,272
Leave me alone.

707
01:26:40,392 --> 01:26:45,359
Whore! Whore!

708
01:26:45,479 --> 01:26:49,902
You have no idea how
hard it was for Amanda.

709
01:26:50,023 --> 01:26:53,905
All the torment. Because of you.

710
01:26:55,820 --> 01:26:57,065
Go on.

711
01:26:57,185 --> 01:27:00,043
First today, I knew
it was your father.

712
01:27:00,662 --> 01:27:03,446
The school had to be found out,
what was happening.

713
01:27:04,162 --> 01:27:08,243
Then left your family
urgently country.

714
01:27:09,681 --> 01:27:12,678
Apparently helped your escape
nor family.

715
01:27:12,798 --> 01:27:17,551
- He feared well the consequences?
- You know nothing about my father.

716
01:27:18,673 --> 01:27:21,148
He knew no fear.
Only for love.

717
01:27:21,670 --> 01:27:26,407
Arthur Pryce was a great man.
And will always be a great man.

718
01:27:29,076 --> 01:27:31,299
What we shared with each other -

719
01:27:32,924 --> 01:27:36,752
- was wonderful, skřnt. And clean.

720
01:27:38,145 --> 01:27:43,106
My father did what he did
to honor and preserve...

721
01:27:44,263 --> 01:27:46,313
Father...

722
01:28:45,919 --> 01:28:47,519
Father.

723
01:29:05,609 --> 01:29:08,347
<i> My father loved my mother. </ I>

724
01:29:11,480 --> 01:29:14,523
<i> He loved my sister. </ I>

725
01:29:18,696 --> 01:29:22,658
<i> And he loved me.
You see, Joseph, - </ i>

726
01:29:23,399 --> 01:29:28,352
- my sister and I thought that we
had with our father, would last forever.

727
01:29:30,240 --> 01:29:33,165
And that no one could take that away from us.

728
01:29:33,200 --> 01:29:36,732
But it was just exactly what you did.
And yes... -

729
01:29:37,742 --> 01:29:41,538
- Therefore I spćrrede you for 20 years.

730
01:29:47,482 --> 01:29:50,025
It seems
that you have won, Doucett.

731
01:29:50,288 --> 01:29:53,882
- Take me to Mia.
- Yes, of course.

732
01:30:12,184 --> 01:30:16,062
Do you know what I find fascinating
, Joseph?

733
01:30:16,099 --> 01:30:22,963
You have always been avoiding making
the most fundamental questions:

734
01:30:25,587 --> 01:30:28,208
Why did I let you go?

735
01:30:55,968 --> 01:30:58,588
Watch your head.

736
01:31:11,660 --> 01:31:16,586
Welcome to one of the TV series,
that have survived in allerlćngst time -

737
01:31:16,624 --> 01:31:20,285
- even if it only had a single viewer:

738
01:31:21,615 --> 01:31:23,388
You.

739
01:31:47,602 --> 01:31:51,032
<i> We adopted Mia shortly after the tragedy. </ I>

740
01:31:51,533 --> 01:31:58,880
<i> Neither her mother or Doucett
had family, so we were lucky... </ i>

741
01:31:58,915 --> 01:32:03,239
- <i> Blessed.
- Yes, it was a blessing... </ i>

742
01:32:32,600 --> 01:32:38,127
Is not that astonishing?
People believe everything they see on television.

743
01:32:41,303 --> 01:32:44,073
Thank you, Ashley. You can walk again.

744
01:32:52,053 --> 01:32:53,917
Joseph?

745
01:32:53,952 --> 01:32:56,625
No. No. Mia?

746
01:32:57,958 --> 01:32:59,555
Mia!

747
01:32:59,790 --> 01:33:01,735
Mia!

748
01:33:02,094 --> 01:33:07,563
Oh, Joseph. It's not your daughter.

749
01:33:07,888 --> 01:33:12,862
Ashley is a musician,
and a well-paid actor -

750
01:33:12,981 --> 01:33:17,255
- who has been employed by me
since she was ten years old.

751
01:33:18,066 --> 01:33:20,539
I wish you could see you p ..

752
01:33:23,165 --> 01:33:27,156
No more Christmas games!
Tell me where she's gone!

753
01:33:27,417 --> 01:33:31,635
Answer the question,
you have never asked.

754
01:33:33,182 --> 01:33:36,124
Why I let you loose?

755
01:33:38,473 --> 01:33:41,289
Tell me. Tell me that.

756
01:33:44,177 --> 01:33:47,494
You know the answer, Joseph.

757
01:33:48,073 --> 01:33:51,490
Deep in your heart, you know
-

758
01:33:51,845 --> 01:33:55,698
- the simple truth.

759
01:33:56,489 --> 01:33:59,133
<i> - Say hello to the camera.
- Hello. </ I>

760
01:34:05,453 --> 01:34:08,151
It took a while -

761
01:34:08,586 --> 01:34:11,025
- to change her name -

762
01:34:11,978 --> 01:34:13,879
- and her records.

763
01:34:16,872 --> 01:34:20,050
Finding the right parents.

764
01:34:21,371 --> 01:34:24,444
A insensitive mother -

765
01:34:25,290 --> 01:34:30,450
- and a loving father who was
taken from her too soon.

766
01:34:30,485 --> 01:34:34,292
It took me twenty years to create her.

767
01:34:35,660 --> 01:34:38,956
A fřlsom and caring woman -

768
01:34:38,991 --> 01:34:41,506
- who aspired to help people in distress, -

769
01:34:41,625 --> 01:34:45,884
- because she had overcome -

770
01:34:45,885 --> 01:34:49,686
- an enormously sřrgelig past.

771
01:34:49,721 --> 01:34:53,993
A woman
could not do otherwise -

772
01:34:54,028 --> 01:34:58,781
- but to fall in love with a man
like you -

773
01:34:59,915 --> 01:35:03,045
- Joseph Doucett.

774
01:35:09,844 --> 01:35:14,029
No! No!

775
01:35:14,764 --> 01:35:18,075
Oh dear God! No!

776
01:35:23,302 --> 01:35:25,793
CALLING
MARIE SEBASTIAN

777
01:35:30,451 --> 01:35:33,731
- Joe? Joe.
- No!

778
01:35:37,070 --> 01:35:39,895
No!

779
01:35:41,080 --> 01:35:44,022
You can not make her hurt.

780
01:35:44,057 --> 01:35:47,022
- Who is it?
- Leave her out.

781
01:35:47,057 --> 01:35:49,209
- Please...
- Who is it?

782
01:35:49,210 --> 01:35:52,579
Please, help it with
make her hurt.

783
01:35:52,580 --> 01:35:55,294
Do me hurt instead.

784
01:35:57,021 --> 01:35:59,748
Kill me.

785
01:35:59,783 --> 01:36:04,030
Kill me.
Please, kill me.

786
01:36:04,065 --> 01:36:09,460
I will not kill you, Joseph.
This is the reason why I let you free.

787
01:36:14,292 --> 01:36:19,659
So I could experience this moment
with you.

788
01:36:20,934 --> 01:36:24,928
So you could fully understand,
what I had, -

789
01:36:24,963 --> 01:36:28,136
- and what you took from me.

790
01:36:45,071 --> 01:36:47,931
Now that I am free, -

791
01:36:47,966 --> 01:36:51,021
- the rest is silence.
