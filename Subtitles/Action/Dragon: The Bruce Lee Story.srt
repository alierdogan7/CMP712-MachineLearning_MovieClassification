1
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:52,800
kung fu is more than
a system of fighting.

2
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:54,920
It's a system of thought.

3
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:59,160
you must outthink your opponent,
whatever form he takes...

4
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:03,160
because some of them
will be more than just men.

5
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:05,920
what else could it be, sifu?

6
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:08,960
we all have inner demons
to fight.

7
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:13,440
we call these demons fear
and hatred and anger.

8
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:16,960
If you don't conquer them,
then a life of a hundred years...

9
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:18,880
is a tragedy.

10
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:21,200
If you do,
a life of a single day...

11
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:23,840
can be a triumph.

12
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,600
don't worry about it.
don't worry.

13
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:10,960
excuse me, my son.

14
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,360
uh, six pints
of beer, mate.

15
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:16,960
- no.
- aw, come on.

16
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:22,400
oh, god, what about
that one there?

17
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,760
hello. mind if I take over?
go on, piss off!.

18
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:43,680
big boy!.

19
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:47,880
hey, look,
I'm fred astaire!.

20
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,800
she's a bit frisky, isn't she?

21
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:04,560
oh, yeah. come on, one, two.
oh, I love it when they fight back.

22
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:06,640
one, two, come on!

23
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:09,880
stay back. stay back.
back in-- hey, hey! back in line.

24
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:18,120
- what do you want?
- I want to dance with her.

25
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:21,000
this one's mine.
get one of your own.

26
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:25,520
she is one of my own.

27
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:49,080
hold it, lads.

28
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:52,880
leave him to me.
come on, try that again.

29
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:56,360
I'm gonna get you,
you little yellow bastard.

30
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:59,040
smash your face in.

31
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,920
try it again, huh?

32
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:47,840
hey, bob!

33
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:57,560
wanna try this?

34
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:04,760
okay.

35
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,600
papa!

36
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:15,840
the police were here.
they're looking for you.

37
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:18,840
- I know.
- the sailor's in hospital
with a punctured lung.

38
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:21,960
- he might die.
- he was making trouble.
he started it.

39
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:25,840
he's the nephew of the assistant
police lnspector of kowloon.

40
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:28,360
I can hide out
with my friends.

41
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:31,320
you don't have
any friends now!

42
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:46,840
the cops will be back.

43
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:49,400
I should
get out of here.

44
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:51,320
sit down.

45
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:58,920
I've thought a lot
about this...

46
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:02,040
for a very long time.

47
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:05,320
- you'll have to leave hong kong.
- for how long?

48
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:07,240
forever.

49
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:11,800
this is a joke, right?
you're joking.

50
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:16,280
listen to me, sai-fong, you'll die
in hong kong. I've seen it.

51
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:19,320
you're too superstitious,
papa.

52
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:26,360
you're a man now.
almost.

53
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:29,720
you have a right to know everything.
you had an older brother.

54
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:32,920
he died in childbirth.

55
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,200
the demon took him
away from us.

56
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:38,360
the firstborn man-child
is very valuable.

57
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:42,280
so when you were born,
I name you sai-fong, a girl's name.

58
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:46,760
we dress you in dresses so the demon
wouldn't know I had another son.

59
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:50,360
I made you speak english,
all so we could fool him.

60
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:52,280
but now he knows.

61
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:55,480
and he's coming for you.

62
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:59,400
you must leave tonight.

63
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:01,520
where, papa?
where can I go?

64
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:04,720
you love american movies.

65
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:07,360
you love american cars.

66
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:10,520
- you go to america.
- america?

67
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:14,200
I was in america on tour
with the canton opera company in 1940.

68
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:17,360
san francisco.
doing the drunken princess.

69
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:19,760
november 27th,
you were born.

70
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:23,120
that morning I got you
and three good reviews.

71
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:26,040
I was very proud.
come here. come here.

72
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:33,400
this...

73
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:35,440
is your birth
certificate.

74
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:37,720
"bruce lee."

75
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:41,160
- It sounded very american.
- It sure does.

76
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:47,800
you were born there.
show this to the immigration man.

77
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:51,000
they have to let you in.

78
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,920
you need money
to go to america.

79
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:00,080
It's yours.

80
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:03,480
I saved it for you...

81
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:05,400
for a day like today.

82
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:11,240
I don't know
what to say.

83
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:17,240
say you'll do better.

84
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:19,720
tell me you'll make
a big noise in america...

85
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:22,600
so I can hear it
over here.

86
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:52,320
no.

87
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:54,240
- do you speak english?
- yeah.

88
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:57,800
I'm practicing my english.
going to america.

89
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:00,360
I've always wanted
to go to america.

90
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,720
james dean.

91
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:07,920
french fries. the sky's the limit,
that's what they say.

92
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,400
not a chinaman's chance.
they say that too.

93
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:14,320
- you ever hear that?
- no.

94
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:18,240
you know, the chinese,
we built the railroads there.

95
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:20,760
the americans, the gwailo,
would lower chinamens...

96
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:23,880
over the cliff in baskets
to set the dynamite.

97
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,480
get pulled up too slow,
bang!

98
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,520
rope break.

99
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,960
bye-bye. bye-bye.

100
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:34,040
bye-bye.

101
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:38,480
americans say,
"not a chinaman's chance"...

102
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:41,120
and round-eyed gwailo
would laugh.

103
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:44,600
we're not human to them.

104
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:48,640
- how do you know?
- I'm a history teacher.

105
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:53,240
things are different now.
It's today.

106
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:57,240

- come on, touch me, chink. come on.
- hit him, joe.

176
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:59,960
quit looking at him
and touch me, chink.

177
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:02,680
come on, man.

178
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:05,640
he's scared of you, man.

179
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:08,760
he's scared.

180
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:11,720
- mr. henderson, we so sorry.
- are you coming?

181
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:14,680
I have to finish
my workout.

182
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:17,120
might as well finish
on you.

183
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:23,880
- finish him, joe.
- okay, chink, let's go.

184
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:27,560
ken, andy,
get off the mat!

185
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:30,960
- go on, man,
I'm gonna kill this guy.
- you can take him, joe.

186
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:32,880
wait.

187
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:36,240
what is this? what are you gonna do,
stink me to death?

188
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:38,160
come on! come on.

189
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:41,040
wait. wait.
so sorry.

190
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:45,960
oh! what is this,
a fight or a striptease?

191
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:49,360
come on! come on!

192
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:51,120
- okay, I ready.
- yeah?

193
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:57,080
aah! very good
shadow boxing!

194
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:59,240
you... aaaah!

195
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:03,600
- chinks can jump real high, huh?
- come on, joe!

196
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:06,320
come on.

197
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:09,600
come on, show him what for, joe.

198
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:11,520
aaah!

199
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:13,960
- get up, joe!
- I'll kill you, you bastard!

200
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:17,720
I'm no bastard. I'm bruce lee!

201
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:41,040
sorry about your father.
that was koreans.

202
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:43,440
I'm an american.

203
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:54,280
- you sure showed him, henderson!
- yeah, way to go, joe.

204
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:04,760
hey!
ease up, ease up.

205
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:06,680
we come in peace.

206
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:08,760
I'm benny sayles
and this is tad overton.

207
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:10,960
we just wanna ask you
a question.

208
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:13,320
that jujitsu stuff.
can you teach us?

209
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:15,240
can anybody do it?

210
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:20,600
I told you.
It's secret chink stuff.

211
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:24,080
aaaaah!

212
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:26,520
shit.

213
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:30,520
- you okay?
- yeah, I'm all right.

214
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:33,880
you see that? you see how it flowed?
be like water.

215
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,840
water's the softest stuff
in the world...

216
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:37,760
but it can fit
into any container.

217
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:41,720
It seems weak,
but it can penetrate rock.

218
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:44,800
be like the nature
of water.

219
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:47,360
that's it for today.
friday we spar, eh?

220
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:49,280
- all right.
- all right.

221
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:51,200
- hi, guys.
- hi, linda.

222
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:53,400
- hi. hi.
- hi.

223
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:55,480
Is this class
only for guys?

224
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:57,720
'cause it looks like
you only teach guys.

225
00:28:57,800 --> 00:29:01,880
I teach whoever wants to learn.
usually guys are the ones
interested in fighting.

226
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:03,800
I've dated some
of these animals.

227
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:06,680
- I've done plenty of fighting.
- ha ha.
- ooh!

228
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:10,360
but seriously, I'd like
to take lessons.

229
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:13,240
how about friday?
3:00?

230
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:15,160
that's a date.

231
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:18,040
no, that's an appointment.

232
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:21,200
- there's a difference.
- see ya, bruce.

233
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:23,760
- bye, guys.
- bye, linda.

234
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:32,640
emotion can be the enemy.

235
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:35,440
If you give in to emotion,
you can lose yourself.

236
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:37,960
be at one
with your emotions...

237
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:41,720
because the body
always follows the mind.

238
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:44,080
this is not about winning.

239
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:46,000
this is about perfection.

240
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:49,400
then why all those
colored belts?

241
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:52,040
the only thing belts are good for
is to hold your pants up.

242
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:54,120
okay, let's spar,
shall we?

243
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:56,200
um, linda?

244
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:00,280
linda and...

245
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:05,240
linda and me, I guess.
come, linda.

246
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:07,160
go get 'em, linda.

247
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:10,800
- remember reference? okay.
- mm-hmm.

248
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:14,920
set?

249
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:19,800
you're open.

250
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:21,720
I saw it coming.

251
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:26,800
- uhh!
- yeah!

252
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:30,760
there you go. you see?
It isn't size or strength that matters.

253
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:34,200
It's focus.
you all have a chi, an inner spirit.

254
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:36,600
focus and then there's nothing
you cannot bend to your will.

255
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:38,520
like you just saw.

256
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:42,120
find your reference points
and square off.

257
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:44,400
good.

258
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:46,760
I kinda
like this position.

259
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:48,720
then say "yes"
to a date.

260
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:50,640
- all of us?
- no, just you and me.

261
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:52,560
- why?
- why?

262
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:56,280
- yeah, why? why me?
- 'cause I already fell for you.

263
00:30:56,840 --> 00:31:00,440
premier nikita khrushchev made his
first visit to the berlin wall today.

264
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:03,120
with his entourage,
he surveyed the structure...

265
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:06,240
- which has made a division--
- bye, mom! I'm going bowling!

266
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:08,600
- I'm not deaf.
- I'm sorry.

267
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:11,480
- you're going where?
- I'm going bowling.

268
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:14,680
- have fun. not too late, now.
- okay. nope.

269
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:17,400
bowling, for christ's sakes, emery?

270
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:19,560
couldn't you think
of something better? bowling?

271
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:22,040
give me a break, sherry.
I needed the bag.

272
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:27,480
hey, watch that upholstery!
It's my father's car.

273
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:29,400
okay! watch the road!

274
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:33,560
I don't believe you.

275
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:37,640
oh. you think he likes blue?

276
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:40,760
do you think this dress
is too wrinkled?

277
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:43,320
all this
for a chinese guy.

278
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:46,320
I can't believe you're going out
with a chinese guy.

279
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:48,760
well, let me tell ya,
if you met him...

280
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:50,680
you'd get it.

281
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:53,840
I don't think I could kiss
somebody who wasn't white.

282
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:56,120
l-I just don't think
I could do that.

283
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:59,000
I'll try and live with that thought.
I really will.

284
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:02,600
- you'd kiss him?
- kiss him? at least.

285
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:06,520
you'd let him put his tongue
in your mouth. a chinese guy.

286
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:09,080
who knows? maybe more.

287
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:11,960
you are so low, emery.

288
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:14,200
you pretend to be this jock...

289
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:16,360
but you're a, a beatnik.

290
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:19,920
ooh. pass me the bongos,
daddy-o.

291
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:29,640
hi.

292
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:35,400
- you look great.
- thanks.

293
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:39,400
- blue looks good on you.
- I'm glad you like it.
you look really good yourself.

294
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:42,200
I've never seen you
with so many clothes on.

295
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:44,720
- wanna get a table?
- yeah. okay.

296
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:48,680
lee. we have
reservations at 8:00.

297
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:54,240
I'm sorry. I don't have
a table right now.

298
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:56,920
perhaps you'd like
to sit at the bar.

299
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:59,040
- okay. thank you.
- okay.

300
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:04,600
a philosophy major. now what can
you do with a philosophy major?

301
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:07,800
you can think deep thoughts
about being unemployed.

302
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:11,640
you're such a good teacher. have you
ever thought about teaching kung fu?

303
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:13,560
what do you think
I've been doing?

304
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:18,240
no, but I mean really going for it.
In the american way.

305
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:21,240
making a business.
a chain, like mcdonald's.

306
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:23,960
I like teaching, but--

307
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:27,160
oh, sure, it's fun to throw
helpless girls on the floor.

308
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:29,680
seriously, I like the way
it changes people.

309
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:34,040
you can't change people
with your fists. I've learned that.

310
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:37,840
see, they see something strange,
something they don't understand...

311
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:39,760
and they get afraid.

312
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:42,240
teach them the beauty of that strange
thing and they're no longer afraid...

313
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:45,000
because it's become
part of them.

314
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:48,280
well, sometimes strange things
can be very beautiful.

315
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:52,760
excuse me.

316
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:56,600
It's been half an hour and I still
see people being seated ahead of us.

317
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:59,480
come, don't exaggerate.
It's been barely twenty minutes.

318
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:07,240
like to have
our check, please.

319
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:09,680
- I was thinking.
- what were you thinking?

320
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:12,760
I'd like to take you
someplace else...

321
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:14,840
someplace good.

322
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:16,760
thank you.

323
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:42,800
two for
breakfast at tiffany's.

324
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:46,040
- hey, baby, what's going on here?
- oh, hi.

325
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:47,960
- you're gonna love this movie.
- oh, yeah?

326
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:04,240
- you remember?
- miss-a go-right-ry!

327
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:06,320
I protest!

328
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:10,080
I lost my key.

329
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:12,000
but that was two weeks ago.

330
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:14,520
you cannot keep
ringing my bell!

331
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:17,720
you disturb-a me.
you must have a key made!

332
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:20,120
It won't do any good.
I'll just lose them all.

333
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:24,440
- you like me. you know you do.
- come on, baby, what is this?

334
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:26,360
you like me.
I'm a liked guy.

335
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:29,640
In thirty seconds, I going
to call the po-rice!

336
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:33,480
I got to get my rest!
I'm an artist.

337
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:35,600
let's get out of here.

338
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:38,840
don't be angry. I won't do it again.

339
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:40,760
If you promise
not to be angry...

340
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:44,720
- I might let you take those
pictures we mentioned.
- when?

341
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:16,440
what is this place?
what are we doing here?

342
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:18,840
- come on, be a little adventurous.
- where are you taking me?

343
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:44,120
- well, what do you think?
- I don't know what to think.

344
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:47,400
what do you mean you don't know
what to think? this was your idea.

345
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:50,280
my idea, to move into
an industrial slum?

346
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:53,040
this is no slum!

347
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:56,680
this is the first
bruce lee kung fu lnstitute.

348
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:59,960
you talked me
into it.

349
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:03,200
you make me feel
like I can do anything.

350
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:14,840
you can.

351
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:23,160
when I came over on the boat,
I knew this was an "idea" place.

352
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:28,600
ldeas make this country great.
here a good idea makes a man
anything he wants to be.

353
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:32,960
you drop a pebble in a pond,
you get ripples.

354
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:36,920
soon the ripples
cross the whole pond.

355
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:39,800
come here.

356
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:47,960
drop it.

357
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:54,560
see, it's begun.

358
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:40,920
set.

359
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:44,360
one! two! three!

360
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:47,640
one! two! three!

361
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:51,160
one! two! three!

362
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:55,640
one! two! three!

363
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:59,120
one! two! three!

364
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:28,520
what is wrong with you today?
you're acting so funny.

365
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:32,080
hmm?

366
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:38,480
well, I gotta go.

367
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:41,640
I told mom l'd
help her with dinner.

368
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:46,120
your mother must think
you're a professional bowler by now.

369
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:48,480
- I'm gonna tell her.
- when?

370
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:55,240
when I'm ready.

371
00:41:55,360 --> 00:41:57,400
are you ashamed?

372
00:41:57,520 --> 00:42:01,240
are you ashamed
you wanna marry a chinaman?

373
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:06,160
no, I'm not ashamed.

374
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:09,200
are you ashamed of me?
did you tell your father about me?

375
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:12,760
did you tell him about
your little gwailo girl?

376
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:15,640
yes.

377
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:20,400
what did he say?

378
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:23,160
doesn't matter
what he said.

379
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:26,040
what matters
is I told him.

380
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:34,080
okay.

381
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:41,040
okay.

382
00:42:41,120 --> 00:42:43,920
I'm gonna tell her.

383
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:50,480
she's just not gonna
understand, bruce.

384
00:42:51,640 --> 00:42:53,840
- sugar, mr. lee?
- please.

385
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:56,560
- cream?
- no.

386
00:42:56,640 --> 00:43:00,800
- how many sugars?
- just one.

387
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:04,240
- linda, you want some coffee, too?
- no, thank you.

388
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:07,360
thank you.

389
00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:10,640
- cookie?
- no.

390
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:14,440
are you pregnant?

391
00:43:17,320 --> 00:43:20,080
no.

392
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:26,920
okay. okay.

393
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:31,800
let's look at this from all angles.
how will you live?

394
00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:35,680
I'm opening a school in oakland.
maybe one in palo alto?

395
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:38,560
soon it'll become
a chain like mcdonald's.

396
00:43:38,680 --> 00:43:42,520
I don't wanna rain on
your parade, mr. lee, but
the world needs hamburgers.

397
00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:44,760
- It doesn't need judo.
- kung fu.

398
00:43:44,840 --> 00:43:46,680
whatever.

399
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:49,440
more and more people
are studying it all the time.

400
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:54,240
- that's how l
put myself through school.
- okay, I'll give you that.

401
00:43:54,360 --> 00:43:58,720
so let's get down to
the real issue: children.

402
00:43:58,840 --> 00:44:02,440
after all, linda, that's what
marriage is really about: children.

403
00:44:07,960 --> 00:44:10,360
we wanna have children,
someday.

404
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:14,600
ah. but what
will they be?

405
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:17,560
they won't be white
and they won't be oriental.

406
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:21,400
they'll be some kind of half-breed, and
they won't be accepted by either side.

407
00:44:21,480 --> 00:44:24,720
they'll be american.
linda's american, I'm american.

408
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:28,200
you're an american citizen.
you're not really an american.

409
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:37,000
- bruce.
- you'd better put
a band-aid on that cut.

410
00:44:37,120 --> 00:44:41,080
bruce. bruce!

411
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:44,000
I spoke to him like a gentleman.
you heard me.

412
00:44:44,120 --> 00:44:45,840
- my favorite china.
- mom--

413
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:50,320
you can do better than that. believe me,
you'll forget about him in a month.

414
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:52,680
do you really wanna
have yellow babies?

415
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:55,720
- can you imagine that,
yellow babies? oh, linda.
- yes, I can.

416
00:44:55,840 --> 00:44:58,600
all this will do is bring you pain.
linda, listen to me.

417
00:44:58,720 --> 00:45:01,720
- I can't allow it. I'm sorry,
but I can't allow it. linda--
- It's not up to you.

418
00:45:01,840 --> 00:45:04,600
- mom, it's not up to you!
- linda!

419
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:06,600
linda! linda!

420
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:09,360
- stop! wait!
- no! no! no!

421
00:45:09,720 --> 00:45:12,280
bruce!

422
00:45:14,760 --> 00:45:17,480
bruce!

423
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:54,560
- what's this?
- all-purpose loan.

424
00:45:54,680 --> 00:45:57,720
- where're you going?
- to a wedding!

425
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:26,880
- hi, honey!
- hi, hon.

426
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,080
- anything?
- not yet.

427
00:46:29,160 --> 00:46:32,920
- what are you doing?
- just giving the place
a little blessing.

428
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:36,400
well, we don't need a blessing
because we've got advertising.

429
00:46:44,280 --> 00:46:46,440
you open?

430
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:52,960
come in, come in.

431
00:46:55,960 --> 00:46:58,600
caught the flyer.
thought I'd check it out.

432
00:46:58,720 --> 00:47:00,440
see?

433
00:47:00,520 --> 00:47:04,280
seen some of them
chop-socky flicks, man.

434
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:06,960
some cool shit.

435
00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:09,400
name's jerome.
jerome sprout.

436
00:47:09,480 --> 00:47:11,240
bruce lee.
my wife, linda.

437
00:47:11,360 --> 00:47:13,440
- hey.
- hi, jerome.

438
00:47:13,560 --> 00:47:16,040
- I'd like to take some lessons.
- I like to give them.

439
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:21,320
- solid. now, you know
I'm not chinese?
- I've noticed that.

440
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:25,160
some of them other chinese teachers,
man, they turn me down flat.

441
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:28,360
- some of 'em wouldn't
even let me in the door.
- you got yourself a teacher.

442
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:32,040
I can dig it, man.
you got yourself a student.

443
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:35,000
keep repeating it.
now backwards. go for a switch.

444
00:47:35,120 --> 00:47:37,800
- like that?
- yeah. yeah.

445
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:42,160
we're gonna speed up a little bit.
all right, ready?

446
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:45,000
oh! whoop!

447
00:47:45,120 --> 00:47:48,120
one! two! one!

448
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:50,480
two! one! two!

449
00:47:50,560 --> 00:47:53,560
one! two!
one! two!

450
00:47:53,680 --> 00:47:57,200
one! two!
one! two! one!

451
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:04,840
one! two! one! two!

452
00:48:08,640 --> 00:48:11,760
thank you.

453
00:48:11,840 --> 00:48:15,880
one! two!
one! two!

454
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:19,720
one! two!
one! two!

455
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:47,880
bruce. I know you
like to be called bruce.

456
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:51,240
you've been charged with
violating the martial arts code.

457
00:48:51,360 --> 00:48:56,200
we've had several complaints
from wu zuolin and wong jack man
and many others.

458
00:48:56,320 --> 00:48:59,080
you've been teaching the gwailo.
this must stop.

459
00:48:59,200 --> 00:49:02,520
I'll teach whoever
wants to learn.

460
00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:08,440
bruce, we do things
differently here.

461
00:49:08,520 --> 00:49:13,480
one of the things we do not do is
teach our secrets to whites, blacks.

462
00:49:13,600 --> 00:49:16,360
they are the enemy.

463
00:49:18,120 --> 00:49:21,040
they are not the enemy.
they just don't know us.

464
00:49:21,120 --> 00:49:23,760
we've been so closed
for so long,

465
00:49:23,840 --> 00:49:26,640
they've never seen the real beauty
of our culture.

466
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:29,720
- let's show it to them.
- no. no. no.

467
00:49:29,840 --> 00:49:34,640
I'm sorry. we do not agree. you are
ordered to stop teaching the gwailo.

468
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:36,560
or what?

469
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:39,640
or we will settle this
by combat.

470
00:49:40,680 --> 00:49:42,520
prepare yourself.

471
00:50:05,480 --> 00:50:08,600
- not hungry?
- nah.

472
00:50:18,560 --> 00:50:23,760
- you canceled all your classes today.
- I had to take care of some business.

473
00:50:23,840 --> 00:50:28,200
- what business?
- oh, nothing much.

474
00:50:28,320 --> 00:50:30,120
tax stuff.

475
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:35,840
- I better get going.
- there's something
you're not telling me.

476
00:50:38,320 --> 00:50:41,240
do we owe
a lot of money?

477
00:50:49,120 --> 00:50:51,880
I owe everything...

478
00:50:53,360 --> 00:50:55,480
to you.

479
00:50:55,560 --> 00:50:57,880
see you.

480
00:51:10,560 --> 00:51:12,600
what'd you find out?

481
00:51:12,680 --> 00:51:15,160
-bookies are laying 20 to 1 against you.
-who is this guy?

482
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:19,560
johnny sun. he's got a school
on thompson. he's a killer, man.

483
00:51:19,680 --> 00:51:22,280
- what are you, his press agent?
- he's a real killer.

484
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:24,720
a couple of brothers
tried to rob him last year.

485
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:28,920
one went to a hospital.
one with a gun went to a funeral home.

486
00:51:29,040 --> 00:51:32,760
you're a real confidence
builder, jerome.

487
00:52:14,360 --> 00:52:17,680
man, they eat their
wheaties in that family.

488
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:20,440
tiny there's his
younger brother luke.

489
00:52:20,560 --> 00:52:22,680
bruce, forget
about this stuff.

490
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:27,480
forget about all us gwailo and let's
get the hell outta here right now.

491
00:54:40,640 --> 00:54:42,440
yah!

492
00:55:21,440 --> 00:55:24,560
do you give up?
do you give up?

493
00:55:24,640 --> 00:55:29,360
- do you give up?
- I give up. I give up.

494
00:55:30,880 --> 00:55:33,800
- I give up.
- right on!

495
00:55:42,080 --> 00:55:44,920
I teach who I want.

496
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:47,400
the decision is mine.

497
00:56:30,120 --> 00:56:34,360
dr. donan, come to the hospital
administration office.

498
00:56:34,440 --> 00:56:37,480
dr. craig and dr. donan,
to the hospital administration office.

499
00:56:37,600 --> 00:56:41,400
- mrs. lee, I'm dr. arlo.
- how is he? Is he okay?

500
00:56:43,040 --> 00:56:46,480
- let's not talk in here.
- Is he okay?

501
00:56:57,600 --> 00:57:01,160
there are some papers
to sign, mrs. lee.

502
00:57:02,600 --> 00:57:06,200
- mrs. lee.
- huh?

503
00:57:06,320 --> 00:57:09,080
some-- there are some papers.
some papers.

504
00:57:32,560 --> 00:57:38,200
you know, this thing's kinda sexy. maybe
we can keep it after you're better.

505
00:57:38,280 --> 00:57:40,960
I'm sorry.

506
00:57:41,080 --> 00:57:43,800
It was a bad joke.

507
00:57:47,200 --> 00:57:51,400
I know you're mad. don't be mad.
lt'll only make things worse.

508
00:57:51,520 --> 00:57:55,640
worse? couldn't take a hell of a lot
to make things worse.

509
00:57:55,720 --> 00:57:59,120
- you should've told me
where you were going.
- why?

510
00:57:59,200 --> 00:58:02,160
because I'm your wife, that's why!
I had a right to know.

511
00:58:02,240 --> 00:58:06,400
you might wanna think about that.
the wife part, I mean.

512
00:58:10,180 --> 00:58:14,220
- what're you saying?
- take a good look at me, linda.

513
00:58:19,340 --> 00:58:22,180
- so we've got a little trouble.
- this is more than a little trouble!

514
00:58:22,260 --> 00:58:24,420
okay, so we've got
big trouble!

515
00:58:24,500 --> 00:58:27,300
you're always going on about
the beauties of your chinese culture!

516
00:58:27,420 --> 00:58:30,740
let me tell you about the beauties
of my culture! we love big trouble!

517
00:58:30,860 --> 00:58:34,140
that's what you say now! In six months,
you'll be looking for the back door!

518
00:58:34,260 --> 00:58:38,140
oh, no, it's never gonna be over
between you and me! you get it?

519
00:58:38,260 --> 00:58:40,820
go back to your mother, linda!
I'm finished!

520
00:58:40,900 --> 00:58:43,700
tell her I made
a mistake. do it!

521
00:58:43,780 --> 00:58:46,740
you hear me? tell her
you made a mistake! don't touch me!

522
00:58:46,860 --> 00:58:51,580
I don't want you here!
I don't want you! get out! go!

523
00:58:51,700 --> 00:58:53,940
leave me alone!

524
00:58:54,060 --> 00:58:55,980
don't look at me
like that!

525
00:59:16,940 --> 00:59:19,300
who is it? who's there?

526
00:59:22,220 --> 00:59:25,460
who is it?

527
00:59:25,540 --> 00:59:27,380
who's there?

528
00:59:35,620 --> 00:59:39,300
hi. I thought
I'd improve the view.

529
00:59:39,420 --> 00:59:42,300
oh, look at
the big kung fu man.

530
00:59:42,380 --> 00:59:46,340
- first sign of trouble
and all he does is quit.
- shut up! shut up!

531
00:59:49,420 --> 00:59:53,140
see this notebook? looks like the
ones we had in school, right?

532
00:59:53,260 --> 00:59:55,620
wrong.
this is your future.

533
00:59:55,700 --> 00:59:59,340
- I don't have any more future.
- sure, you do.

534
00:59:59,460 --> 01:00:03,100
you know, all I keep hearing
is the fight took too long.

535
01:00:03,180 --> 01:00:05,660
too much tradition,
too much classical mess...

536
01:00:05,740 --> 01:00:08,300
too many fixed positions
in wing chun.

537
01:00:08,380 --> 01:00:11,260
you know everything
that's wrong, so fix it.

538
01:00:11,340 --> 01:00:13,740
stop whining
and start fighting.

539
01:00:13,860 --> 01:00:15,860
fight back
with your mind.

540
01:00:15,980 --> 01:00:20,660
- I can't write, I can't move!
- you talk, quitter. I'll write.

541
01:00:27,700 --> 01:00:31,980
- I'm waiting.
- It would take forever.

542
01:00:32,060 --> 01:00:34,860
you goin' anywhere?

543
01:00:36,380 --> 01:00:39,980
I'm not.

544
01:00:40,060 --> 01:00:44,140
oh, yeah, there's
just one more thing.

545
01:00:45,660 --> 01:00:48,460
I'm pregnant.

546
01:00:53,060 --> 01:00:57,740
the great mistake is to anticipate
the outcome of the engagement.

547
01:00:57,860 --> 01:00:59,660
you ought not
to be thinking...

548
01:00:59,780 --> 01:01:03,500
of whether it ends
in victory or defeat;

549
01:01:03,580 --> 01:01:06,660
but let nature
take its course...

550
01:01:06,780 --> 01:01:11,220
and your tools will strike
at the right moment.

551
01:01:11,300 --> 01:01:14,580
the consciousness of self
is the greatest hindrance...

552
01:01:14,660 --> 01:01:16,500
to the proper execution
of all--

553
01:01:16,580 --> 01:01:18,900
the knowledge and skill you have
achieved are meant to be forgotten.

554
01:01:19,020 --> 01:01:21,780
so you can float-- to obtain
enlightenment in martial art...

555
01:01:21,900 --> 01:01:23,900
means the extinction
of everything which--

556
01:01:24,020 --> 01:01:28,180
the way to transcend karma lies in
the proper use of the mind and the will.

557
01:01:28,260 --> 01:01:30,100
jeet kune do
is not to hurt...

558
01:01:30,220 --> 01:01:33,300
but is one of the avenues through which
life opens its secrets to us.

559
01:01:33,420 --> 01:01:36,180
relaxation
is essential...

560
01:01:36,300 --> 01:01:39,860
for faster and
more powerful punching.

561
01:01:39,980 --> 01:01:43,340
let your lead punch
shoot up loosely and ea--

562
01:01:43,420 --> 01:01:45,700
an-and what? "loosely and" what?

563
01:01:45,820 --> 01:01:49,100
- loosely and easily!
- "easily." okay.

564
01:01:49,220 --> 01:01:52,380
do not tighten up
or clench your fists...

565
01:01:52,460 --> 01:01:55,260
until the moment
of impact.

566
01:01:55,340 --> 01:01:57,180
- aah! aah.
- okay, come on. come on.

567
01:01:57,260 --> 01:02:00,500
all punches should end
with a snap several inches...

568
01:02:00,580 --> 01:02:03,260
- behind the target.
- okay.

569
01:02:05,860 --> 01:02:07,660
morning, ladies!

570
01:02:07,780 --> 01:02:11,180
- congratulations, mr. lee.
- thank you.

571
01:02:50,860 --> 01:02:52,900
hey, kiddo.

572
01:02:52,980 --> 01:02:55,940
he's too young
to shave.

573
01:02:56,020 --> 01:02:59,940
they aren't shaving mirrors.
they're called pat kwa.

574
01:03:00,060 --> 01:03:03,180
pat kwa?

575
01:03:03,300 --> 01:03:05,380
they're like gargoyles
on churches.

576
01:03:05,500 --> 01:03:09,260
you put them around
to ward off evil spirits.

577
01:03:13,020 --> 01:03:16,780
- I wanna call him brandon.
- brandon.

578
01:03:16,900 --> 01:03:18,860
that's good.

579
01:03:18,940 --> 01:03:21,220
do you wanna hold him?

580
01:03:53,020 --> 01:03:55,820
- oh, look at daddy.
- hey, big guy.

581
01:03:55,900 --> 01:03:59,220
come on up here. shh!

582
01:04:01,420 --> 01:04:04,660
- he's so tiny.
- hi, baby.

583
01:04:04,740 --> 01:04:07,700
- don't be afraid.
- he's so tiny.

584
01:04:09,180 --> 01:04:11,500
you're beautiful.

585
01:04:18,140 --> 01:04:21,460
- bruce? bruce,
come here! It came!
- yeah?

586
01:04:21,540 --> 01:04:23,740
look! It's here,
it's here, it's here!

587
01:04:23,860 --> 01:04:26,620
- oh.
- open it! open it up quick!

588
01:04:31,940 --> 01:04:33,740
whoa!

589
01:04:33,860 --> 01:04:36,420
It's your book!
It's your book.

590
01:04:36,500 --> 01:04:40,060
look at that.

591
01:04:43,260 --> 01:04:46,020
okay, hold on.
I'll get it.

592
01:04:56,180 --> 01:04:59,900
- hi.
- hi.

593
01:05:00,020 --> 01:05:03,980
- may I come in?
- why?

594
01:05:04,100 --> 01:05:07,980
- I like your hair.
- come on, mom, I don't
wanna chitchat with you.

595
01:05:08,100 --> 01:05:11,300
- what are you doing here?
- I came to see you and--

596
01:05:11,380 --> 01:05:13,700
did you come
to see me...

597
01:05:13,780 --> 01:05:17,420
or did you come to see
the yellow baby?

598
01:05:17,540 --> 01:05:21,220
- I think maybe I made a mistake.
- brandon, it's grandma!

599
01:05:21,300 --> 01:05:24,780
grandma's come to see you!
come on in, grandma!

600
01:05:25,980 --> 01:05:28,620
there's someone
you ought to meet.

601
01:05:31,700 --> 01:05:33,540
come on.

602
01:05:40,420 --> 01:05:42,380
how are you feeling,
mr. lee?

603
01:05:42,500 --> 01:05:46,260
- oh, like half-man, half-car.
- glad to hear it.

604
01:05:49,860 --> 01:05:53,660
linda, your mom's got great legs.
great legs!

605
01:06:01,260 --> 01:06:03,540
he looks--

606
01:06:05,780 --> 01:06:09,100
well, he-- he looks
like both of you.

607
01:06:11,420 --> 01:06:13,660
may l?

608
01:06:34,780 --> 01:06:38,220
oh, come on,
sweetheart.

609
01:06:38,300 --> 01:06:40,660
there you go.

610
01:06:40,740 --> 01:06:43,540
hello. yes.

611
01:06:43,620 --> 01:06:47,380
you're such
a handsome fella.

612
01:06:47,460 --> 01:06:49,420
he's gorgeous.

613
01:06:56,140 --> 01:06:58,540
he's so sweet.

614
01:06:58,620 --> 01:07:00,580
oh, yes, you are.

615
01:07:05,500 --> 01:07:07,500
you did good,
sweetheart.

616
01:07:07,620 --> 01:07:10,940
you sure did good.
gosh, yes.

617
01:07:11,020 --> 01:07:13,180
look at you!

618
01:07:13,300 --> 01:07:17,980
brandon, you're a strong one.
only you could do this.

619
01:07:35,660 --> 01:07:39,020
the art of jeet kune do
is simply to simplify.

620
01:07:39,140 --> 01:07:42,980
It favors formlessness so that
it can assume all forms.

621
01:07:43,100 --> 01:07:46,140
kung fu, karate,
tae kwan do.

622
01:07:46,220 --> 01:07:48,740
all the classical styles
are attempts...

623
01:07:48,860 --> 01:07:51,100
to arrest
the flux of conflict.

624
01:07:51,180 --> 01:07:54,620
but in actual combat, the opponent
doesn't wait for formalities.

625
01:07:54,700 --> 01:07:57,700
he's not a robot, but a human
being, fluid and alive.

626
01:08:02,060 --> 01:08:05,060
for instance--
for instance!

627
01:08:05,180 --> 01:08:08,540
like a sculptor who doesn't
keep adding clay to a statue...

628
01:08:08,620 --> 01:08:11,620
but strips away the inessentials
until the truth is revealed.

629
01:08:11,740 --> 01:08:14,980
I have developed a way of fighting
with no fixed positions...

630
01:08:15,100 --> 01:08:16,900
with no set movements.

631
01:08:25,300 --> 01:08:27,700
the fancy mess
of martial arts...

632
01:08:27,820 --> 01:08:30,220
solidifies
what was once fluid.

633
01:08:30,300 --> 01:08:34,220
It is nothing but blind devotion
to the systematic uselessness...

634
01:08:34,300 --> 01:08:36,860
of routines
that lead nowhere.

635
01:08:36,940 --> 01:08:41,020
calm down!

636
01:08:45,780 --> 01:08:48,780
calm down! calm down!

637
01:08:48,860 --> 01:08:51,180
- tell him to prove it!
- yeah!

638
01:08:51,300 --> 01:08:53,100
tell him
to prove it!

639
01:08:53,220 --> 01:08:56,780
mr. lee is not here
for competition.

640
01:08:56,900 --> 01:08:58,820
prove it! prove it!

641
01:08:58,900 --> 01:09:01,180
- prove it! prove it!
- all right, calm down, calm down!

642
01:09:01,300 --> 01:09:04,580
- keep it quiet! mr. lee--
- prove it! prove it!

643
01:09:04,660 --> 01:09:07,500
- prove it! prove it!
- okay!

644
01:09:07,580 --> 01:09:09,540
okay, I'll prove it.

645
01:09:11,580 --> 01:09:14,620
I'll need someone
to prove it on.

646
01:09:18,020 --> 01:09:20,260
I'll beat any man
in this room in 60 seconds!

647
01:09:20,380 --> 01:09:22,260
what?

648
01:09:25,660 --> 01:09:27,980
I'll fight him!

649
01:09:32,540 --> 01:09:35,980
I beat him before!

650
01:09:36,060 --> 01:09:39,340
I beat him again!

651
01:09:55,300 --> 01:09:58,300
what are you, crazy?
the doctor said no more fighting.

652
01:09:58,420 --> 01:10:00,860
they told me l'd
never walk again, too.

653
01:10:00,940 --> 01:10:04,060
when will you be happy?
when they're right?

654
01:10:04,140 --> 01:10:06,340
bruce, I'm begging you.
If you love me--

655
01:10:06,460 --> 01:10:09,100
- this isn't about you and me.
- fine!

656
01:10:09,220 --> 01:10:12,660
but I'm not going through this again,
do you understand me?

657
01:10:12,740 --> 01:10:15,020
you get hurt,
you're on your own.

658
01:10:17,100 --> 01:10:19,900
don't go
too far, hon!

659
01:10:20,020 --> 01:10:23,260
lt'll be over
in sixty seconds.

660
01:10:56,220 --> 01:10:59,260
this is
a challenge match...

661
01:10:59,340 --> 01:11:03,580
to prove mr. lee's theories
on jeet kune do.

662
01:11:03,660 --> 01:11:06,300
sixty seconds.

663
01:11:11,300 --> 01:11:13,700
bow to the judges.

664
01:11:20,540 --> 01:11:23,340
bow to each other.

665
01:11:27,140 --> 01:11:29,100
begin!

666
01:13:28,500 --> 01:13:30,340
jesus christ!

667
01:14:08,020 --> 01:14:11,300
bruce lee! bruce lee!
bruce lee! bruce lee!

668
01:14:11,380 --> 01:14:15,340
bruce lee! bruce lee!
bruce lee! bruce lee!

669
01:14:15,460 --> 01:14:17,140
bruce lee! bruce lee!
bruce lee! bruce lee!

670
01:14:19,260 --> 01:14:23,140
- yeah!
- hey, mr. lee!

671
01:14:24,980 --> 01:14:28,180
bill krieger's the name. you looked
pretty great out there today.

672
01:14:28,300 --> 01:14:32,340
no, he didn't. he was too slow.
he took too long.

673
01:14:32,460 --> 01:14:34,780
you looked pretty fast to me.

674
01:14:34,900 --> 01:14:37,580
you think you can do some of
that stuff in front of a camera?

675
01:14:37,660 --> 01:14:41,860
- I'm a tv producer and--
- right, and I'm marvin gaye.

676
01:14:41,980 --> 01:14:45,580
I'm casting my new series.
It's called the green hornet...

677
01:14:45,660 --> 01:14:48,540
and I think
we could use you.

678
01:15:01,020 --> 01:15:03,860
so, d'you hear I bought
a house on the beach?

679
01:15:03,940 --> 01:15:05,780
right in malibu.
I'm tellin' ya...

680
01:15:05,860 --> 01:15:08,700
I got 120 yards of sand
as my front yard.

681
01:15:08,780 --> 01:15:12,500
th-that's too tight. I can
sell the stunt. you don't have
to cut off the circulation.

682
01:15:12,580 --> 01:15:14,580
cal, run him
through the scene.

683
01:15:14,660 --> 01:15:18,820
as soon as you get your cue light,
you come through that door.

684
01:15:18,940 --> 01:15:21,700
then you work your way
down this catwalk here.

685
01:15:21,820 --> 01:15:24,500
be real careful as
you negotiate this corner.

686
01:15:24,580 --> 01:15:27,540
I want you to get down these steps
as fast as you can.

687
01:15:27,620 --> 01:15:29,500
not too fast.

688
01:15:29,620 --> 01:15:32,700
I don't want you to tumble. I don't
want to lose you on the first show.

689
01:15:32,780 --> 01:15:34,620
when you get
to this landing...

690
01:15:34,700 --> 01:15:37,300
do you think you could take
these five steps all at once?

691
01:15:37,380 --> 01:15:39,220
- I'll try.
- atta boy.

692
01:15:39,300 --> 01:15:41,860
first positions, everybody!

693
01:15:41,980 --> 01:15:44,300
hey, can you tell
it's me?

694
01:15:45,860 --> 01:15:48,700
I just talked to the network.
they love the dailies. they love 'em.

695
01:15:48,780 --> 01:15:51,460
- don't they always?
- yeah. listen, there's, uh--

696
01:15:51,580 --> 01:15:55,540
- there's one small problem.
- lemme call you back.

697
01:15:55,660 --> 01:15:59,620
- yeah, what is it?
- uh, it's this guy lee.

698
01:15:59,700 --> 01:16:02,660
you know, he's
awfully... oriental.

699
01:16:02,740 --> 01:16:04,860
- he's supposed to be oriental.
- yeah.

700
01:16:04,940 --> 01:16:07,300
- he's playing an oriental.
- I know, I know. what?

701
01:16:07,380 --> 01:16:09,940
- kato is oriental.
- I know, I know.

702
01:16:10,060 --> 01:16:13,020
uh, can you just make sure
he keeps the mask on?

703
01:16:13,100 --> 01:16:16,580
roll sound!
roll camera!

704
01:16:16,700 --> 01:16:20,100
and mark it!

705
01:16:22,060 --> 01:16:24,980
- action!
- all right, green hornet...

706
01:16:25,100 --> 01:16:27,180
where's
the secret formula?

707
01:16:27,300 --> 01:16:32,420
- where it belongs.
- okay, have it your way.

708
01:16:44,740 --> 01:16:46,500
kato!

709
01:16:55,380 --> 01:16:57,580
good work, kato!

710
01:16:57,700 --> 01:17:00,620
good work, kato!

711
01:17:00,740 --> 01:17:02,980
ow! ow!

712
01:17:04,500 --> 01:17:06,980
hey, hey, hey, hey!

713
01:17:11,180 --> 01:17:13,940
- good work, kato.
- thanks, boss.

714
01:17:17,340 --> 01:17:21,780
huh? ah, cut, cut, cut!

715
01:17:21,860 --> 01:17:24,020
that's a print.

716
01:17:24,100 --> 01:17:27,020
thought that'd be
a little more exciting.

717
01:17:30,020 --> 01:17:32,740
If he came from hong kong,
he'd end up in san francisco.

718
01:17:32,860 --> 01:17:35,620
- I don't wanna do the urban thing.
- we helped with the railroads.

719
01:17:35,740 --> 01:17:38,580
- how about the wild west?
- okay, great. the wild west.

720
01:17:38,700 --> 01:17:40,820
- okay.
- chinese immigrant wanders the land.

721
01:17:40,940 --> 01:17:44,140
- he's a good guy, a hero.
- of course, he's a hero.
he's the star of the show.

722
01:17:44,220 --> 01:17:46,060
he wanders the land
solving problems.

723
01:17:46,140 --> 01:17:49,340
- every week he solves a problem.
- with no gun. just his hands.

724
01:17:49,460 --> 01:17:51,340
that's good.
that's great. no gun.

725
01:17:51,460 --> 01:17:54,820
- he's looking for something.
- his father. he lost his father
who came ahead of him.

726
01:17:54,940 --> 01:17:58,260
no, no, not the father. the father
thing has been done to death.

727
01:17:58,340 --> 01:18:00,180
- he's searching for his brother.
- good.

728
01:18:00,260 --> 01:18:02,100
- searching for his brother.
- he never finds him.

729
01:18:02,180 --> 01:18:05,820
- not until the fifth year.
- he wanders the land,
searching for his brother...

730
01:18:05,940 --> 01:18:09,540
- solving problems with no gun.
- and he has something
no one else has ever seen.

731
01:18:09,660 --> 01:18:12,220
- kung fu! starring bruce lee.
- kung fu! uh-huh.

732
01:18:12,260 --> 01:18:15,260
he remembers what he was taught
in the old country by his teacher...

733
01:18:15,380 --> 01:18:17,180
and teaches people
his culture.

734
01:18:17,300 --> 01:18:20,060
after he's kicked the shit
out of everybody. fantastic!

735
01:18:20,180 --> 01:18:23,380
- we've got action, culture!
It's a western!
- but it's an eastern.

736
01:18:23,460 --> 01:18:25,660
It's an eastern.
right. It's an eastern.

737
01:18:25,740 --> 01:18:28,220
they're gonna love it.
this thing's gonna run forever!

738
01:18:28,300 --> 01:18:30,140
- kung fu!
- kung fu!

739
01:18:31,420 --> 01:18:32,860
easy, easy.

740
01:18:42,700 --> 01:18:44,660
wow.

741
01:18:44,780 --> 01:18:48,020
- you steal steve mcqueen's car?
- he stole mine.

742
01:18:48,140 --> 01:18:50,500
- come on, get in. we're late.
- okay.

743
01:18:50,620 --> 01:18:52,860
what? linda. hey.

744
01:18:52,940 --> 01:18:56,100
-l--
-you do the clutch, I'll work the stick.

745
01:19:32,020 --> 01:19:33,900
bruce! linda!

746
01:19:33,980 --> 01:19:37,580
- so glad you guys could make it.
go on in. we'll be right down.
- okay.

747
01:19:37,660 --> 01:19:39,820
this way, please.

748
01:19:58,300 --> 01:20:01,660
excuse me, mr. krieger,
there's a phone call.

749
01:20:01,780 --> 01:20:03,700
excuse me.

750
01:20:06,300 --> 01:20:09,100
did I ever tell you I was
the cha-cha champion of hong kong?

751
01:20:09,180 --> 01:20:11,860
about 15,000 times.

752
01:20:11,940 --> 01:20:15,660
- did I ever tell you I was pregnant?
- once.

753
01:20:15,740 --> 01:20:19,060
make that twice.

754
01:20:24,100 --> 01:20:26,860
hold it, everybody!
hold it!

755
01:20:27,100 --> 01:20:31,020
hold it!

756
01:20:31,100 --> 01:20:33,900
I know the timing
is lousy, but, uh...

757
01:20:33,980 --> 01:20:36,780
I wanted you to hear it
first from me personally.

758
01:20:36,860 --> 01:20:39,260
the show's been cancelled.

759
01:20:39,380 --> 01:20:41,180
- what?
- oh, no.

760
01:20:41,300 --> 01:20:44,380
I know it's a bummer, but we'll
finish out the last episodes...

761
01:20:44,500 --> 01:20:47,380
and, uh, that'll be that.

762
01:20:47,500 --> 01:20:50,100
I'm sorry.

763
01:20:50,220 --> 01:20:53,060
enjoy the rest of the party.

764
01:20:55,220 --> 01:20:59,220
bill and I will just roll
into kung fu!

765
01:20:59,300 --> 01:21:01,540
1, 2, cha-cha-cha.

766
01:21:01,660 --> 01:21:04,420
1, 2, cha-cha-cha.
1 and 2 and 3 and 4...

767
01:21:04,540 --> 01:21:07,820
and 1 and 2 and 3 and 4.
1, 2, cha-cha-cha.

768
01:21:07,940 --> 01:21:10,940
uh-huh. uh-huh.

769
01:21:11,060 --> 01:21:15,260
so what are they saying at
the network about kung fu?

770
01:21:15,380 --> 01:21:17,860
right.

771
01:21:17,980 --> 01:21:20,140
and when do you think
they'll know?

772
01:21:20,260 --> 01:21:24,140
oh, bill, bill, bill.
what about dinner?

773
01:21:24,260 --> 01:21:26,300
call me back.

774
01:21:36,740 --> 01:21:40,220
they still haven't made
any decisions on the show.

775
01:21:40,340 --> 01:21:43,260
- still looks good.
- good.

776
01:21:43,340 --> 01:21:45,580
don't worry.

777
01:21:45,700 --> 01:21:48,300
who else are they gonna get,
mickey rooney?

778
01:21:48,380 --> 01:21:50,340
I'm not worried.

779
01:21:51,980 --> 01:21:54,260
I'm not worried.

780
01:22:38,300 --> 01:22:40,140
hello?

781
01:22:42,420 --> 01:22:45,220
- really?
- as quickly as you can...

782
01:22:45,300 --> 01:22:47,660
snatch the pebble
from my hand.

783
01:22:47,980 --> 01:22:49,580
all right.

784
01:22:52,180 --> 01:22:55,540
- okay.
- when you can take
the pebble from my hand...

785
01:22:55,660 --> 01:22:57,860
it will be time
for you to leave.

786
01:22:59,420 --> 01:23:01,780
what's wrong, honey?

787
01:23:04,500 --> 01:23:07,300
my father's dead.

788
01:24:16,140 --> 01:24:18,940
- It comes, it goes.
- In your dream?

789
01:24:19,020 --> 01:24:22,540
no, I'm always awake.
It's not a dream, sifu.

790
01:24:22,660 --> 01:24:26,060
when your father first brought
you here, he told me everything.

791
01:24:26,180 --> 01:24:28,340
he wanted you to learn
wing chun...

792
01:24:28,460 --> 01:24:31,020
to protect yourself
against man...

793
01:24:31,060 --> 01:24:33,540
- and other forces.
- I thought that was all superstition.

794
01:24:33,620 --> 01:24:38,820
superstition is a name the ignorant
give to their ignorance.

795
01:24:38,900 --> 01:24:41,860
you were special then,
and you're special now.

796
01:24:41,940 --> 01:24:44,580
that's why the demon
wants you.

797
01:24:46,860 --> 01:24:50,460
we have spent a lot of time together,
preparing you for this.

798
01:24:54,980 --> 01:24:57,140
good. good.

799
01:24:57,260 --> 01:24:59,540
very good.

800
01:25:01,940 --> 01:25:05,060
what if I won't fight him?

801
01:25:05,140 --> 01:25:06,980
you have no choice.

802
01:25:07,060 --> 01:25:11,620
-you're fighting for more than yourself.
-what are you saying, sifu?

803
01:25:11,700 --> 01:25:15,660
as I told you, this demon
is your inner fear.

804
01:25:15,740 --> 01:25:18,980
It doesn't matter
how many men you defeat.

805
01:25:19,060 --> 01:25:21,420
If you don't conquer
your own fears...

806
01:25:21,500 --> 01:25:24,060
you will pass your demons
on to your children...

807
01:25:24,140 --> 01:25:27,260
as your father passed his
on to you.

808
01:25:29,620 --> 01:25:31,460
no.

809
01:25:31,540 --> 01:25:33,380
you will fight him.

810
01:25:38,340 --> 01:25:41,100
when you are
at your absolute peak...

811
01:25:41,180 --> 01:25:43,340
he will come to you.

812
01:25:43,420 --> 01:25:46,700
when the monsoon blow,
be prepared.

813
01:26:53,700 --> 01:26:56,900
mr. lee! mr. lee!

814
01:26:57,020 --> 01:26:59,620
I've been chasing you
all over hong kong.

815
01:26:59,740 --> 01:27:01,740
you should buy a car.

816
01:27:01,860 --> 01:27:05,500
- just a joke.
- I'm philip tan.

817
01:27:05,620 --> 01:27:08,220
I'm a producer. I want to
make a picture with you.

818
01:27:08,300 --> 01:27:11,260
- talk is cheap. pictures are expensive.
- I'm on the level.

819
01:27:11,340 --> 01:27:13,380
you're kato,
and over here...

820
01:27:13,500 --> 01:27:16,420
kato has a small
but loyal following.

821
01:27:16,540 --> 01:27:18,380
something we can build on.

822
01:27:18,500 --> 01:27:21,700
they don't call your show the green
hornet. It's called the kato show.

823
01:27:21,820 --> 01:27:24,740
did you know that?
well, it's true.

824
01:27:24,820 --> 01:27:28,060
when I hear kato is in town,
I consider it a good omen.

825
01:27:28,140 --> 01:27:31,220
- I've got to get back to my family.
- leave tomorrow. give us time.

826
01:27:31,340 --> 01:27:34,580
-I've been away for so long.
-I'll buy you a new ticket, first class.

827
01:27:34,700 --> 01:27:37,500
I'll take care of everything.
one more day, please.

828
01:27:37,580 --> 01:27:40,140
you can't lose.

829
01:27:40,180 --> 01:27:42,020
what's the movie?

830
01:28:05,940 --> 01:28:08,300
action! action!

831
01:28:08,420 --> 01:28:10,860
action!

832
01:28:33,700 --> 01:28:35,620
my brother can't talk right.

833
01:28:35,740 --> 01:28:37,540
he can't walk right.

834
01:28:37,660 --> 01:28:39,860
you have dishonored
my family.

835
01:28:39,940 --> 01:28:41,780
- I have sworn to kill you.
- swearing is easy.

836
01:28:45,340 --> 01:28:49,580
I read your book.
I know all your tricks.

837
01:28:49,660 --> 01:28:52,220
let's see how well you've
learned your lesson.

838
01:32:46,260 --> 01:32:50,780
It's so hot in here, I like
to put my dolly in the refrigerator.

839
01:32:50,860 --> 01:32:52,820
yeah, that was fun!

840
01:32:52,940 --> 01:32:54,940
- we missed you!
- I missed you too!

841
01:32:55,020 --> 01:32:56,940
- I missed you.
- I missed you!

842
01:33:55,380 --> 01:33:57,300
hurry up! over there!

843
01:34:00,380 --> 01:34:02,940
listen, cheng, give up.

844
01:34:05,380 --> 01:34:07,620
cheng!

845
01:34:07,740 --> 01:34:09,540
ohh!

846
01:34:12,940 --> 01:34:14,740
It's okay, mei.

847
01:34:36,100 --> 01:34:38,740
let's get out of here
before they lynch us.

848
01:35:15,100 --> 01:35:17,940
yeah! hey!

849
01:35:18,060 --> 01:35:21,220
bruce!

850
01:35:56,260 --> 01:35:58,860
bruce!

851
01:35:58,940 --> 01:36:01,020
linda!

852
01:36:01,140 --> 01:36:02,940
bruce!

853
01:36:04,980 --> 01:36:07,540
bruce!

854
01:37:23,140 --> 01:37:25,020
daddy's taking me
to the circus!

855
01:37:25,100 --> 01:37:27,540
oh, my.

856
01:37:27,620 --> 01:37:30,620
- okay, brandon, go change.
don't keep daddy waiting.
- okay!

857
01:37:39,820 --> 01:37:42,260
okay, back! back!
number two. number two.

858
01:37:45,860 --> 01:37:48,100
It's okay.

859
01:37:48,180 --> 01:37:50,580
come on, big boy.

860
01:37:50,700 --> 01:37:52,620
come on.

861
01:37:52,740 --> 01:37:57,220
your bed is so much more cozy.
come on.

862
01:37:57,340 --> 01:37:59,740
we'll go up to your bed with
the covers and everything.

863
01:38:22,220 --> 01:38:26,380
somewhere there's gotta be
a series in all this.

864
01:38:30,460 --> 01:38:34,300
three minutes.
It's like doing 200 pushups.

865
01:38:38,020 --> 01:38:39,860
- wanna try?
- uh, no thanks.

866
01:38:39,980 --> 01:38:43,540
- you might turn it up
and try to electrocute me.
- the thought crossed my mind.

867
01:38:43,660 --> 01:38:46,220
justifiable homicide,
some might say.

868
01:38:46,300 --> 01:38:49,180
what do you want, bill?

869
01:38:49,300 --> 01:38:53,500
- you didn't come here
to discuss old times.
- I came to discuss new times.

870
01:38:53,620 --> 01:38:57,580
there's somebody I want you to meet.
his name is freddie weintraub.

871
01:38:57,700 --> 01:38:59,500
we've got a project for you.

872
01:38:59,620 --> 01:39:02,260
what's the matter,
david carradine turn you down?

873
01:39:02,380 --> 01:39:05,940
no, fred's got a script.
It's called enter the dragon.

874
01:39:06,060 --> 01:39:08,860
we're gonna shoot it here,
but it's your ticket back to america.

875
01:39:08,980 --> 01:39:11,700
It's a feature.

876
01:39:11,780 --> 01:39:13,740
a hollywood feature.

877
01:39:13,820 --> 01:39:16,700
with all the trimmings.
hmm?

878
01:39:16,820 --> 01:39:19,660
hey!

879
01:39:49,900 --> 01:39:51,740
ohh.

880
01:39:51,820 --> 01:39:53,860
It's okay.

881
01:39:53,980 --> 01:39:55,780
I'm awake.

882
01:39:57,100 --> 01:39:59,340
I was working
on game of death.

883
01:39:59,460 --> 01:40:01,260
lost track of time.

884
01:40:02,900 --> 01:40:05,820
the kids okay?

885
01:40:05,940 --> 01:40:09,820
don't you ever get tired
of asking that question?

886
01:40:09,900 --> 01:40:12,460
linda, we've been
through this before.

887
01:40:12,580 --> 01:40:15,300
I don't have a choice.

888
01:40:15,420 --> 01:40:17,980
you might not...

889
01:40:18,020 --> 01:40:20,180
but I do.

890
01:40:20,260 --> 01:40:23,540
I'm taking the kids
and going home for a while.

891
01:40:23,620 --> 01:40:27,940
- home's here for now.
- no. here is where we watch you work.

892
01:40:28,060 --> 01:40:31,980
- what do you want me to do?
- I want you to come with us.

893
01:40:32,100 --> 01:40:35,100
forget it.

894
01:40:35,180 --> 01:40:37,980
I worked in america for ten years
and what did it get me?

895
01:40:38,060 --> 01:40:41,820
- It got me nothing.
- It got you me.

896
01:40:41,900 --> 01:40:44,500
oh, man.

897
01:40:44,620 --> 01:40:47,340
they got such
a good line of bullshit.

898
01:40:47,460 --> 01:40:50,220
"come and get it!"
"america, the mountain of gold!"

899
01:40:50,340 --> 01:40:52,740
"It's for everybody!!"
yeah, it's for everybody white!

900
01:40:52,820 --> 01:40:56,420
but they don't tell you that!
you gotta read the small print!

901
01:40:56,500 --> 01:40:58,340
If you can read.

902
01:40:59,700 --> 01:41:01,860
I am not america.

903
01:41:01,980 --> 01:41:05,460
your kids are not america.
don't push us away.

904
01:41:08,820 --> 01:41:11,540
we're going.

905
01:41:11,660 --> 01:41:13,940
I want you
to come with us.

906
01:41:17,220 --> 01:41:20,340
I want the kids
to have a father again.

907
01:41:20,460 --> 01:41:22,540
don't lay any
guilt trips on me!

908
01:41:22,620 --> 01:41:26,380
- I'm not taking any guilt trips!
- this place is eating us up!

909
01:41:26,500 --> 01:41:30,180
- can't you see that, bruce?
- this place has given us a life!

910
01:41:30,260 --> 01:41:32,660
I'm somebody here!
I'm special!

911
01:41:32,780 --> 01:41:34,820
back there,
I'm just another gook!

912
01:41:34,900 --> 01:41:38,820
just another wetback, charlie chan,
slopehead, coolie dishwasher...

913
01:41:38,900 --> 01:41:40,980
in a stinking chinkie
restaurant!

914
01:41:41,100 --> 01:41:42,700
mom!

915
01:41:42,780 --> 01:41:44,780
wash your shirt, mister white man?

916
01:41:44,860 --> 01:41:47,460
please?
no tickee, no shirtee!

917
01:41:47,540 --> 01:41:51,100
- order one from column "a"
and one from column "b!"
- mommy!

918
01:41:51,220 --> 01:41:53,020
me happy to build
the railroads...

919
01:41:53,140 --> 01:41:55,580
to dig the mines for you,
mister white man!

920
01:41:57,620 --> 01:42:00,820
- mommy, I'm scared! what's happening?
- Is that who I am?

921
01:42:00,900 --> 01:42:03,820
Is it? tell me!
tell me that's who I am!

922
01:42:03,900 --> 01:42:07,180
I don't know who the hell
you are anymore!

923
01:42:08,860 --> 01:42:11,540
- do you?
- mommy, what's happening?

924
01:42:30,820 --> 01:42:34,140
weintraub's script is called enter
the dragon. I read it. It's really good.

925
01:42:34,260 --> 01:42:37,700
- I thought we were partners.
I made you my partner!
- we are partners!

926
01:42:37,820 --> 01:42:39,620
I told him without you,
no deal.

927
01:42:39,740 --> 01:42:41,860
"a co-production In association
with philip tan"?

928
01:42:41,980 --> 01:42:44,420
- that's an insult!
- you could get more.

929
01:42:44,540 --> 01:42:47,580
- It's not about getting more.
we don't need them!
- yes, we do.

930
01:42:47,660 --> 01:42:50,860
It's warner brothers,
big budget, in english, with
international distribution!

931
01:42:50,980 --> 01:42:53,980
don't sell me, bruce!
don't sell a salesman!

932
01:43:01,420 --> 01:43:03,980
do you have an aspirin?

933
01:43:20,860 --> 01:43:24,420
I don't know, man. I don't know
how much longer I can keep this up.

934
01:43:28,540 --> 01:43:31,500
you want it so bad,
don't you?

935
01:43:31,620 --> 01:43:33,820
you want their love so bad.

936
01:43:33,900 --> 01:43:35,740
our love's
not good enough for you.

937
01:43:35,820 --> 01:43:39,500
when I was a kid,
I had all these crazy ideas.

938
01:43:41,220 --> 01:43:45,580
I wanted to show the world the beauty
of our culture, to give them a hero.

939
01:43:45,700 --> 01:43:48,460
- but a chinese hero.
- you have.

940
01:43:48,540 --> 01:43:50,380
don't you see that?

941
01:43:53,460 --> 01:43:55,540
I want something else now.

942
01:43:57,620 --> 01:44:00,820
I want to stop breaking
my wife's heart.

943
01:44:00,940 --> 01:44:04,180
I want to play with my children
without having to look at the clock.

944
01:44:07,340 --> 01:44:09,260
they're american.

945
01:44:10,780 --> 01:44:13,580
I need to get back to america
or I'll lose them.

946
01:44:18,700 --> 01:44:21,420
If I lose them,
nothing means anything.

947
01:46:46,100 --> 01:46:47,860
look!

948
01:46:50,980 --> 01:46:52,980
no.

949
01:46:53,100 --> 01:46:57,420
no!

950
01:46:57,500 --> 01:47:00,820
nooo!

951
01:47:00,940 --> 01:47:03,380
nooooooo!

952
01:47:05,940 --> 01:47:08,140
daddy! dad!

953
01:47:08,260 --> 01:47:13,660
- dad, come home! dad!
- brandon, run!

954
01:47:13,780 --> 01:47:17,620
- run, brandon! run, brandon! go!
- dad! come on, dad!

955
01:47:17,700 --> 01:47:20,540
brandon, run!

956
01:47:20,660 --> 01:47:23,220
- aaah!
- dad?

957
01:47:23,260 --> 01:47:27,860
dad! dad, he's coming! dad!

958
01:47:29,380 --> 01:47:33,260
come on, dad!
dad, he's coming!

959
01:47:38,220 --> 01:47:40,340
dad!

960
01:47:46,460 --> 01:47:48,860
It's okay, brandon!
It's okay!

961
01:47:51,820 --> 01:47:54,500
dad!

962
01:48:12,620 --> 01:48:15,380
now, brandon, now!
now! run!

963
01:48:41,460 --> 01:48:44,500
kind of lost you there
for a minute, bud. you okay?

964
01:48:49,580 --> 01:48:51,420
bruce? you all right?

965
01:48:51,500 --> 01:48:53,380
you all right?

966
01:49:09,140 --> 01:49:11,100
dad! what are you
doing here?

967
01:49:11,180 --> 01:49:14,300
I live here.

968
01:49:14,380 --> 01:49:16,940
- hey, can I play with you guys?
- sure.

969
01:49:16,980 --> 01:49:19,820
daddy, we had a typhoon.

970
01:49:20,940 --> 01:49:22,740
I know.

971
01:49:24,180 --> 01:49:26,740
but it's over now.

972
01:49:26,820 --> 01:49:31,180
okay, dad, I'll be
the engineer, you be the switcher.

973
01:49:31,300 --> 01:49:33,540
hey, that sounds great.

974
01:49:38,820 --> 01:49:41,380
last shot.

975
01:49:41,460 --> 01:49:44,020
make it great.

976
01:50:01,700 --> 01:50:04,460
- linda, I forgot something.
- what?

977
01:50:05,820 --> 01:50:08,620
I forgot to tell you
I love you.

978
01:50:11,300 --> 01:50:14,340
you know, I don't think you've
ever said that to me before.

979
01:50:14,420 --> 01:50:17,220
yeah, but I meant it
every day.

980
01:50:51,060 --> 01:50:53,820
three weeks before
the opening of enter the dragon...

981
01:50:53,940 --> 01:50:56,140
the film that brought him
international fame...

982
01:50:56,220 --> 01:50:59,180
bruce fell into
a mysterious coma and died.

983
01:50:59,260 --> 01:51:01,140
he was 32.

984
01:51:01,260 --> 01:51:04,980
over 25,000 people attended
his funeral in hong kong...

985
01:51:05,100 --> 01:51:09,140
but I buried him back home
in america to be close to us.

986
01:51:09,220 --> 01:51:13,020
all these years later, people still
wonder about the way he died.

987
01:51:13,140 --> 01:51:15,900
I prefer to remember
the way he lived.
