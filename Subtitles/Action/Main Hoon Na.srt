1
00:00:20,961 --> 00:00:23,930
I'm here now!

2
00:01:36,703 --> 00:01:39,729
Can we hope for the same gesture
of humanity from Pakistan?

3
00:01:40,307 --> 00:01:42,537
I can't speak to the Indian Army
General like this...

4
00:01:42,776 --> 00:01:44,744
let's simplify this...
- Sir, General Bakshi has arrived!

5
00:01:45,112 --> 00:01:47,410
Already?
- Should I ask him to go back?

6
00:02:04,698 --> 00:02:07,326
Cameras off! No cameras
before the show begins

7
00:02:08,402 --> 00:02:10,461
Are you in charge here?
- Yes sir!

8
00:02:10,704 --> 00:02:13,172
Not anymore!
I'm Brigadier Shekhar Sharma.

9
00:02:13,707 --> 00:02:15,572
The General's security
is my responsibility

10
00:02:15,943 --> 00:02:17,467
Any problems with that?
- Not at all sir!

11
00:02:17,711 --> 00:02:18,678
Good!

12
00:02:19,012 --> 00:02:21,503
Capt. Vikram, Major Abbas...
over there

13
00:02:22,716 --> 00:02:23,683
Major Karan

14
00:02:24,184 --> 00:02:25,913
Come with me

15
00:02:31,458 --> 00:02:33,585
Sir, security camera is in position.
- Good!

16
00:02:34,962 --> 00:02:37,430
All positions secured?
- Yes sir. All positions secured

17
00:02:37,631 --> 00:02:39,064
Good. Let the show begin

18
00:02:41,735 --> 00:02:43,703
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to 'People's Voice'

19
00:02:44,137 --> 00:02:48,540
I'm your host, Rajat Saxena
and today's issue is:

20
00:02:48,976 --> 00:02:55,040
Project Milaap (Unity), a historic
step or a historic mistake?

21
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:02,889
The dawn of 15th of August,
our Independence Day...

22
00:03:03,357 --> 00:03:08,454
will see 50 Pakistani prisoners
in Indian custody released...

23
00:03:08,695 --> 00:03:10,458
at the Indian border

24
00:03:12,266 --> 00:03:16,498
Let's meet the man
behind Project Milaap

25
00:03:17,037 --> 00:03:19,904
Please welcome General
Amar Singh Bakshi...

26
00:03:20,207 --> 00:03:22,573
the Commander in Chief
of the Indian Army

27
00:03:31,351 --> 00:03:35,481
We'd first like to
congratulate you sir, because...

28
00:03:36,123 --> 00:03:40,025
the Parliament actually agreed
to Project Milaap this very morning!

29
00:03:43,964 --> 00:03:48,924
General Bakshi, do you really
believe that Project Milaap...

30
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:51,638
will lead to friendship
between India and Pakistan?

31
00:03:52,172 --> 00:03:55,869
It's not so simple.
A chasm of fifty five years...

32
00:03:56,910 --> 00:03:59,538
cannot be bridged
by releasing fifty prisoners

33
00:04:00,013 --> 00:04:06,213
Then why Project Milaap?
- It's a step... to cover the miles

34
00:04:06,486 --> 00:04:09,455
So according to you
they are all innocent!

35
00:04:09,923 --> 00:04:13,882
None of them are terrorists
or ISI agents?

36
00:04:14,261 --> 00:04:17,560
If we had a shred of doubt that
they are dangerous to India...

37
00:04:18,131 --> 00:04:20,099
we would never have
taken this step

38
00:04:20,934 --> 00:04:24,335
Most of them
are poor villagers...

39
00:04:24,938 --> 00:04:27,304
who didn't even know
they had crossed the border

40
00:04:28,642 --> 00:04:31,270
After all the border is not
completely sealed

41
00:04:32,379 --> 00:04:34,347
They didn't even have weapons...

42
00:04:35,115 --> 00:04:39,518
yet they have been in our prisons
for years... some since 1971

43
00:04:40,253 --> 00:04:44,189
We feel it's time to
send them back home

44
00:04:47,494 --> 00:04:50,361
But not everyone agrees
with you General

45
00:04:51,665 --> 00:04:53,929
Some even want to stop you

46
00:04:55,235 --> 00:04:59,069
Everyone has the right to
free speech in a democracy!

47
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,470
But some people
don't want to merely speak

48
00:05:04,177 --> 00:05:06,873
Sir, I'm talking about Raghavan

49
00:05:08,315 --> 00:05:11,284
The people would like to know
who Raghavan is...

50
00:05:12,519 --> 00:05:18,151
and is it true that
he has sworn to stop Project Milaap?

51
00:05:18,458 --> 00:05:23,896
Raghavan is a mask. He hides
his face because of his shame

52
00:05:25,198 --> 00:05:27,598
He's a coward - a terrorist...

53
00:05:28,435 --> 00:05:31,404
so used to violence
that he now fears peace

54
00:05:31,938 --> 00:05:33,906
Project Milaap
will be successful

55
00:05:34,941 --> 00:05:38,433
The prisoners will certainly be
released on the dawn of 15th August

56
00:06:02,235 --> 00:06:05,204
Damn! Back up!
We need back up immediately

57
00:06:18,118 --> 00:06:19,016
Come in

58
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:21,888
Major Ram reporting, sir!
I'm outside the studio

59
00:06:22,189 --> 00:06:26,888
Maj. Ram, hold position for
two minutes! Back up is arriving

60
00:06:27,127 --> 00:06:29,220
It's too late, sir.
I'm going in

61
00:06:42,409 --> 00:06:47,403
Hello General. I'm Raghavan.
I'll ask you the remaining questions

62
00:06:51,952 --> 00:06:56,855
So General, I'm sure Pakistan is also
releasing our poor villagers, right?

63
00:06:57,290 --> 00:06:59,850
Exactly what
I was going to ask him!

64
00:07:02,596 --> 00:07:04,860
When elders speak,
learn to shut up!

65
00:07:10,537 --> 00:07:15,372
So General, what about
Pakistan's show of good will?

66
00:07:16,910 --> 00:07:19,140
We haven't heard anything
from Pakistan yet

67
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:22,876
Then why are we being
so damn foolish?

68
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:25,878
Because someone has to
take the first step

69
00:07:26,586 --> 00:07:30,147
If we all behave like you,
there will never be peace

70
00:07:30,457 --> 00:07:33,551
We've thought about this a lot

71
00:07:34,928 --> 00:07:38,125
And we are certain
that Pakistan will reciprocate

72
00:07:39,699 --> 00:07:42,566
Pakistan! Pakistan is going
to laugh at us...

73
00:07:43,603 --> 00:07:46,071
because they don't want peace.
- Why?

74
00:07:47,107 --> 00:07:49,575
Don't the Pakistanis
love their children?

75
00:07:50,443 --> 00:07:55,073
You do, General!
You love your daughter a lot

76
00:08:05,158 --> 00:08:06,352
Too bad!

77
00:08:07,894 --> 00:08:09,862
She will really miss you, General

78
00:08:10,297 --> 00:08:11,924
No one can save you now

79
00:10:58,431 --> 00:10:59,557
Ram!

80
00:11:31,064 --> 00:11:34,465
Easy now.
You'll be all right, Sharma

81
00:11:35,135 --> 00:11:36,932
Ambulance is on the way

82
00:11:37,971 --> 00:11:40,269
I want to speak to my son

83
00:11:45,478 --> 00:11:46,445
Ram...

84
00:11:52,719 --> 00:11:53,947
Father...

85
00:12:40,967 --> 00:12:42,264
Ram...
- Father...

86
00:12:44,737 --> 00:12:45,704
Please...

87
00:12:46,973 --> 00:12:49,601
Was I a good father?
- Yes father, but right now...

88
00:12:50,176 --> 00:12:54,078
No, tell me!

89
00:12:54,581 --> 00:12:57,209
You're the best father
in the whole world

90
00:12:57,917 --> 00:13:00,477
I'm guilty son!
- No, father

91
00:13:01,921 --> 00:13:03,889
Ram, listen please!

92
00:13:06,259 --> 00:13:09,023
There's something
I've always hidden from you

93
00:13:11,598 --> 00:13:12,895
You...

94
00:13:16,936 --> 00:13:24,399
You're not my only son

95
00:13:41,961 --> 00:13:44,395
I have a wife, Madhu

96
00:13:46,432 --> 00:13:48,593
And a son, Lakshman...

97
00:13:49,969 --> 00:13:53,530
your step... your brother!

98
00:13:55,074 --> 00:13:57,042
Who I haven't seen
for twenty years

99
00:14:11,724 --> 00:14:14,215
It's been twenty years
since she left me

100
00:14:15,929 --> 00:14:19,888
Twenty years I have lived
away from them

101
00:14:21,935 --> 00:14:25,894
It's time I pay for my deeds.
- Don't say this father

102
00:14:30,276 --> 00:14:34,906
I knew you'll forgive me Ram.
Your heart is big

103
00:14:36,583 --> 00:14:40,917
But until she forgives me
I will not find peace

104
00:14:46,426 --> 00:14:49,589
My family will remain broken...
scattered

105
00:14:51,764 --> 00:14:58,135
Promise me Ram, that you will
not immerse my ashes alone...

106
00:14:58,605 --> 00:15:02,097
that both my sons will
do my last rites

107
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:34,504
Where is father's family?

108
00:15:34,974 --> 00:15:38,501
Son, they left
nineteen years back...

109
00:15:40,246 --> 00:15:44,910
Because I came here, right?

110
00:15:48,087 --> 00:15:52,183
Dear Shekhar, I know you consider
what happened between us...

111
00:15:53,026 --> 00:15:54,857
ten years back
a big mistake

112
00:15:56,329 --> 00:16:00,629
I stayed away from you as I knew
how much you loved your wife

113
00:16:02,035 --> 00:16:03,866
But today I'm helpless

114
00:16:04,904 --> 00:16:08,203
By the time you get this letter
I may not be alive

115
00:16:10,109 --> 00:16:12,873
I leave our son in your care

116
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:18,211
Please look after him.
He is your son, too

117
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:23,218
What's your name, son?
- Ram Sharma, sir!

118
00:16:30,930 --> 00:16:32,227
Madhu... please

119
00:16:33,066 --> 00:16:35,899
It was just a mistake

120
00:16:36,936 --> 00:16:38,563
It was just a mistake.
- Mistake?

121
00:16:39,038 --> 00:16:41,905
After marriage
it's called Infidelity, Shekhar

122
00:16:42,341 --> 00:16:45,902
I'm leaving. I can't live
with this lie anymore

123
00:16:46,345 --> 00:16:50,577
Lie? Are you calling
our marriage, our son a lie?

124
00:16:52,051 --> 00:16:54,383
And what about the one
who is sitting outside...

125
00:16:55,221 --> 00:16:57,189
your illegitimate son?

126
00:16:59,125 --> 00:17:00,854
He's a truth too

127
00:17:01,894 --> 00:17:04,454
And if he enters the house,
I am leaving

128
00:17:05,331 --> 00:17:08,232
Where will he go?
It's not his fault

129
00:17:08,901 --> 00:17:11,529
You're right Shekhar.
It's not his fault

130
00:17:12,238 --> 00:17:14,536
It's my fault
for having trusted you

131
00:17:46,105 --> 00:17:47,902
For my sake...

132
00:17:48,541 --> 00:17:50,907
because of me, father
stayed away from his family

133
00:17:55,548 --> 00:17:58,847
I will bring them home

134
00:17:59,886 --> 00:18:04,448
They won't come home, son,
not till you're here

135
00:18:10,496 --> 00:18:13,397
You can't go anywhere
at this stage, Ram

136
00:18:13,966 --> 00:18:16,867
I need you till 15th August.
- I know, sir

137
00:18:17,904 --> 00:18:20,532
But I made a promise
to my father

138
00:18:21,340 --> 00:18:25,470
Then go ahead.
Project Milaap was his dream too

139
00:18:27,613 --> 00:18:31,049
Ram, this is the photograph
Raghavan gave me

140
00:18:32,418 --> 00:18:35,387
It's my daughter Sanjana,
in her college in Darjeeling

141
00:18:36,355 --> 00:18:38,323
This picture was taken
from her college

142
00:18:38,925 --> 00:18:43,328
A gun can reach where a camera can.
And it's my worst fear

143
00:18:43,930 --> 00:18:46,421
Sir, why don't you call her back?
- Because she won't agree

144
00:18:47,066 --> 00:18:50,229
Even if her life's in danger?
- You don't know my daughter, Ram

145
00:18:51,637 --> 00:18:53,901
I haven't seen her
for two years

146
00:18:56,042 --> 00:18:57,907
She hates me

147
00:19:00,546 --> 00:19:05,074
Of course, it's my fault entirely.
I never let her come close to me

148
00:19:06,552 --> 00:19:11,922
I wanted a son. A son,
who would join the army like me

149
00:19:13,726 --> 00:19:17,093
That's why I never loved her...

150
00:19:18,965 --> 00:19:20,933
like I would've loved my son

151
00:19:24,136 --> 00:19:26,604
Today I can give anything
to catch her glimpse...

152
00:19:27,974 --> 00:19:29,339
but she won't let me

153
00:19:30,643 --> 00:19:33,942
Sir, can we not send a 24 hour
Protection Team for her surveillance?

154
00:19:34,413 --> 00:19:36,938
Sanjana will never let anyone
in a uniform come close to her

155
00:19:37,683 --> 00:19:42,347
If anyone does, she will run away
...she's done it before

156
00:19:44,323 --> 00:19:46,951
So what do you recommend sir?
- I want you...

157
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:51,558
to go to Darjeeling,
under cover to protect Sanjana

158
00:19:52,765 --> 00:19:54,494
I don't trust anyone else

159
00:19:54,934 --> 00:20:00,236
I'm sorry, sir. It's impossible for me
to go to Darjeeling right now

160
00:20:01,507 --> 00:20:03,907
I thought you may be interested
in this mission...

161
00:20:04,944 --> 00:20:09,540
as there's another student,
Lakshman Sharma, studying there

162
00:20:13,953 --> 00:20:17,912
Your father and I've been friends
for 25 years. I know everything

163
00:20:18,958 --> 00:20:20,926
Call it fate or co-incidence...

164
00:20:21,494 --> 00:20:25,328
but his wife Madhu and
his son Lakshman live in Darjeeling

165
00:20:26,465 --> 00:20:28,592
You are now officially on leave
till 15th August

166
00:20:29,435 --> 00:20:31,403
I've already spoken
to the Principal of St. Paul's

167
00:20:32,038 --> 00:20:33,938
You are joining the college
from Monday

168
00:20:35,675 --> 00:20:37,939
And what subject
will I teach there?

169
00:20:38,311 --> 00:20:41,280
You are not going there as a teacher
...you will be a student

170
00:20:44,050 --> 00:20:46,280
I'll look really strange
as a student, sir

171
00:20:46,652 --> 00:20:48,950
I think I'm better off as a teacher.
- You can't stay with Sanjana...

172
00:20:49,155 --> 00:20:52,522
all the time as a teacher.
- But I just don't look like a student

173
00:20:52,992 --> 00:20:55,483
Besides, it's been ages since I
attended the national Defence College

174
00:20:55,962 --> 00:21:00,899
Don't worry. Even the principal
will say that you are there...

175
00:21:01,267 --> 00:21:03,235
to complete your graduation
which was left incomplete

176
00:21:03,469 --> 00:21:06,563
But sir, the current generation...?
I've never even seen a civil college

177
00:21:07,273 --> 00:21:10,401
I'll be caught in a day!
- Ram, no matter what...

178
00:21:11,277 --> 00:21:13,245
Project Milaap cannot stop!

179
00:21:13,946 --> 00:21:16,244
Those prisoners have to be released
on 15th August

180
00:21:17,950 --> 00:21:19,542
But Sanjana's safety...?

181
00:21:19,952 --> 00:21:21,920
No harm will come to Sanjana

182
00:21:22,955 --> 00:21:25,253
I promise you, sir.
- Thank you, Major

183
00:22:08,334 --> 00:22:11,895
"Like the winds sigh..."

184
00:22:12,338 --> 00:22:15,899
"and the birds fly..."

185
00:22:16,342 --> 00:22:19,903
"like the bumble bee's affair..."

186
00:22:20,346 --> 00:22:23,907
"I roam without a care"

187
00:22:32,291 --> 00:22:35,920
"I'm the queen of hearts!
What sadness is, I know not"

188
00:22:36,362 --> 00:22:39,263
"With no fear,
I do and I defy"

189
00:22:39,965 --> 00:22:47,497
"Like the winds sigh,
and the birds fly..."

190
00:23:15,267 --> 00:23:19,294
"They can halt, they can try,
they can stop and ask me why..."

191
00:23:19,705 --> 00:23:22,435
"but do I listen,
oh no, not l"

192
00:23:23,275 --> 00:23:26,904
"I'm stubborn,
I'm crazy..."

193
00:23:27,413 --> 00:23:30,246
"They say my mind is hazy..."

194
00:23:30,950 --> 00:23:38,254
"but no one knows
where my dreams lie"

195
00:23:38,757 --> 00:23:45,925
"Like the winds sigh,
and the birds fly..."

196
00:23:46,398 --> 00:23:53,930
"Like the bumble bee's affair,
I roam without a care"

197
00:24:02,314 --> 00:24:05,875
"I'm the queen of hearts,
What sadness is, I know not"

198
00:24:06,285 --> 00:24:09,311
"With no fear,
I do and I defy"

199
00:24:26,205 --> 00:24:31,233
It's odd, I've never seen my brother,
I've no clue what he looks like

200
00:24:31,744 --> 00:24:34,907
But I'm certain
his eyes will be like mine

201
00:24:41,654 --> 00:24:43,918
Actually I think he'd be
exactly like me...

202
00:24:44,323 --> 00:24:46,917
calm, shy, decent, disciplined

203
00:24:55,935 --> 00:24:58,199
And my heart says I will
recognize him instantly...

204
00:24:59,438 --> 00:25:01,065
my little Lakshman

205
00:25:12,985 --> 00:25:16,580
"Let the nymphets
come to lure me"

206
00:25:17,256 --> 00:25:19,884
"And know that I'm no worker bee"

207
00:25:20,926 --> 00:25:24,453
"For when I look into their eyes,
I'll steal their hearts, their minds"

208
00:25:24,997 --> 00:25:27,989
"No matter how gorgeous..."

209
00:25:28,934 --> 00:25:35,567
"they'll be mine
without a fuss"

210
00:25:36,141 --> 00:25:39,599
"Like the winds sigh..."

211
00:25:40,112 --> 00:25:43,377
"and the birds fly..."

212
00:25:43,949 --> 00:25:47,407
"Like the bumble bee's affair..."

213
00:25:47,953 --> 00:25:51,445
"I roam without a care"

214
00:26:00,332 --> 00:26:03,392
"I may be mad, a little strange,
and wilder than most..."

215
00:26:03,936 --> 00:26:06,871
"but the most lovable,
am everybody's toast"

216
00:26:07,573 --> 00:26:10,872
"Like the winds sigh..."

217
00:26:11,310 --> 00:26:14,871
"and the birds fly..."

218
00:26:15,247 --> 00:26:18,876
"Like the bumble bee's affair..."

219
00:26:19,318 --> 00:26:22,879
"I roam without a care"

220
00:26:51,083 --> 00:26:58,182
Friends, it's a truly blessed day
as today we have amongst us...

221
00:26:58,490 --> 00:27:00,458
the famous student
of St. Paul's, Lucky!

222
00:27:04,897 --> 00:27:08,196
When I came to this college
four years back, Lucky was my senior

223
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:12,427
When we first got here,
Lucky ragged us a lot, didn't he?

224
00:27:13,072 --> 00:27:17,441
In the canteen, he stripped me and
made me sing 'My heart will go on... '

225
00:27:19,945 --> 00:27:21,879
He's as smooth as so charming,
smooth and perky

226
00:27:22,014 --> 00:27:23,982
We wanna fail school
just like Lucky!

227
00:27:24,183 --> 00:27:25,878
I love Lucky!

228
00:27:26,151 --> 00:27:30,315
Despite having failed his class
thrice, Lucky is still with us

229
00:27:30,589 --> 00:27:33,558
And God willing,
Lucky may fail again...

230
00:27:33,926 --> 00:27:36,486
and bless our juniors
with his presence too

231
00:27:36,929 --> 00:27:38,897
And now, the moment
we've been waiting for...

232
00:27:43,936 --> 00:27:45,563
Yes, it wasn't easy!

233
00:27:46,004 --> 00:27:48,495
To fail consecutively thrice,
is not an ordinary feat!

234
00:27:51,009 --> 00:27:56,003
But friends, with hard work,
perseverance and dedication...

235
00:27:56,482 --> 00:27:58,848
you can all get here

236
00:28:00,886 --> 00:28:05,346
And if I have your blessings,
I will continue to be with you...

237
00:28:05,891 --> 00:28:10,089
right here, in this college,
for eons to come

238
00:28:10,896 --> 00:28:12,864
That's a promise

239
00:28:22,074 --> 00:28:24,042
Don't you feel any shame?
- Shame, Sanju?

240
00:28:24,443 --> 00:28:28,971
Just look at these faces,
full of love, respect

241
00:28:29,982 --> 00:28:31,950
And I won't need to study
this year as well

242
00:28:32,418 --> 00:28:36,548
I've got you to copy from!
- Yeah, right

243
00:28:37,923 --> 00:28:39,390
Irritating!
- Sanju...

244
00:28:40,259 --> 00:28:43,888
Lucky, is Sanju your girlfriend?
- Avoid, man!

245
00:28:44,329 --> 00:28:47,560
When Lucky has a girlfriend,
the whole college will turn to her

246
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:51,558
Who wants to look at Sanju?
- Hey, I only look at Sanju

247
00:28:52,337 --> 00:28:54,567
Do you think she'll be my girlfriend?
- Are you...?

248
00:28:55,507 --> 00:29:01,002
Oh yes. Why not? What a face!
What muscles!

249
00:29:02,047 --> 00:29:04,015
What style!
- Oh stop!

250
00:29:04,283 --> 00:29:06,251
You're perfect!
- I know

251
00:29:06,618 --> 00:29:10,918
I have an idea! Let's arm wrestle.
I'll beat you and impress Sanju, okay?

252
00:29:11,323 --> 00:29:12,415
Meet me outside

253
00:29:17,657 --> 00:29:22,594
Stop it. You'll hurt yourself, Percy.
- Pain's my middle name, Sanju!

254
00:29:23,396 --> 00:29:25,591
You think you look cool smoking?
- Yeah, yeah

255
00:29:25,965 --> 00:29:27,830
Please! Give it to me.
- Avoid, Sanju!

256
00:29:30,636 --> 00:29:33,196
Hi Mini.
- Hi sweetheart

257
00:29:33,372 --> 00:29:35,135
Where's your miserable boyfriend?

258
00:29:36,309 --> 00:29:37,606
Right here!

259
00:29:37,810 --> 00:29:41,211
Quit playing with fleas!
Wanna fight a man for a change?

260
00:29:42,315 --> 00:29:45,284
Would love to fight with a man.
But I don't mind fighting you either!

261
00:29:45,985 --> 00:29:47,953
Who are you calling a flea?
- Scram!

262
00:29:48,721 --> 00:29:52,623
The loser gets punished!
- And Mini will kiss the winner

263
00:30:16,282 --> 00:30:18,250
Have you gone mad, Sanju?
- What'd I do?

264
00:30:18,618 --> 00:30:20,916
You lost, Lucky!
- Time for punishment!

265
00:30:21,621 --> 00:30:24,181
Whoever walks in first
through that gate...

266
00:30:24,624 --> 00:30:27,184
push the person
and make him fall down. Simple

267
00:30:27,693 --> 00:30:29,092
Hey what if it's a teacher?

268
00:30:32,164 --> 00:30:34,598
Or the principal?

269
00:30:35,301 --> 00:30:37,929
Whatever... man!

270
00:30:39,305 --> 00:30:41,102
It's the principal!

271
00:30:47,747 --> 00:30:49,044
Scared, Lucky?

272
00:31:03,596 --> 00:31:05,564
Come here! Where was I going?

273
00:31:06,932 --> 00:31:08,229
Home, sir!

274
00:31:51,143 --> 00:31:52,337
Hi.
- Hello

275
00:31:53,279 --> 00:31:55,179
Can you tell me
where's the principal's office?

276
00:31:55,648 --> 00:31:57,548
First floor,
third door to the left!

277
00:31:58,651 --> 00:32:00,016
Thank you.
- You're welcome

278
00:32:08,294 --> 00:32:10,262
Sorry man, it was a bet!

279
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:17,569
What's your name?
- Wanna complain to the principal?

280
00:32:17,937 --> 00:32:19,905
Avoid being a pain!

281
00:32:23,609 --> 00:32:25,133
I asked you what your name is

282
00:32:26,612 --> 00:32:31,345
Okay uncle, if you don't like
your face I can change it for you!

283
00:32:39,225 --> 00:32:42,126
C'mon! You think you are tough?
C'mon let's fight, uncle

284
00:32:45,631 --> 00:32:47,599
C'mon, let's go man

285
00:32:48,968 --> 00:32:52,802
Is he our new Chemistry prof?
- What...? Oh God!

286
00:32:53,973 --> 00:32:55,941
C'mon man, you are mine!
- I'm sorry

287
00:32:56,575 --> 00:32:59,544
Behave yourself!
We were just playing a game

288
00:33:01,580 --> 00:33:03,980
Lucky, say sorry. C'mon!
- Sorry

289
00:33:04,183 --> 00:33:05,150
It's okay

290
00:33:05,651 --> 00:33:08,211
Can you take me to
the principal's office? I'm new here

291
00:33:08,621 --> 00:33:10,885
Hey, did I not say first floor,
third door to the left?

292
00:33:11,390 --> 00:33:13,551
He's deaf too! Come on, Sanju.
- Excuse me, Sanju

293
00:33:14,593 --> 00:33:15,890
Hello. I'm Ram

294
00:33:17,596 --> 00:33:19,757
And I'm Lucky.
Now beat it

295
00:33:24,703 --> 00:33:25,670
Tough guy!

296
00:33:33,612 --> 00:33:34,579
Mrs Kakkad!

297
00:33:39,051 --> 00:33:41,849
I'm going to fail them all!

298
00:33:42,321 --> 00:33:44,221
Uncle, leave my hand,
grab it later!

299
00:33:44,623 --> 00:33:46,921
I'm off, bye!
- The hag bores us to death

300
00:33:47,126 --> 00:33:49,253
Shameless!
What are you upto?

301
00:33:49,762 --> 00:33:51,252
Lemme go, uncle!

302
00:33:53,899 --> 00:33:56,925
Hi handsome! Are you
the new Chemistry teacher?

303
00:33:58,571 --> 00:34:01,039
No... I'm a student.
- Student?

304
00:34:01,340 --> 00:34:04,002
I could just die!
I'm Mrs Kakkad, the Hindi teacher!

305
00:34:04,577 --> 00:34:06,044
Good morning, ma'am.
- Good morning

306
00:34:06,245 --> 00:34:08,941
Meet me in the back side
when my period is empty!

307
00:34:09,315 --> 00:34:11,112
I'll teach you everything

308
00:34:11,584 --> 00:34:14,553
Oh! Such strong muscles!

309
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:17,218
What...?
- She means strong muscles!

310
00:34:17,590 --> 00:34:20,115
Thank you. Thank you.
- Mention not

311
00:34:20,693 --> 00:34:23,719
Finally I've found an oasis!

312
00:34:23,996 --> 00:34:26,226
Very good ma'am! Excuse me!
- Sure

313
00:34:26,599 --> 00:34:28,226
Everything is "squeezed" for you

314
00:34:29,668 --> 00:34:31,226
Excuse me, sir

315
00:34:34,607 --> 00:34:37,235
Major Ram Prasad Sharma, sir!
General Bakshi may have spoken to you

316
00:34:38,611 --> 00:34:40,238
Of course. Why didn't you
tell me earlier?

317
00:34:40,679 --> 00:34:43,580
Lieutenant Ram, right?
- Major Ram, sir

318
00:34:46,118 --> 00:34:50,077
What can I do for you, General?
- Not General. Major

319
00:34:51,323 --> 00:34:55,123
Look, no one except you know that
I'm not a student here

320
00:34:55,661 --> 00:34:57,629
So no saluting!
- Right

321
00:34:58,931 --> 00:35:00,523
No saluting

322
00:35:02,001 --> 00:35:03,866
The thing is Captain...
please sit down

323
00:35:04,103 --> 00:35:07,539
I had really wanted to join the army.
But I couldn't remember the ranks

324
00:35:08,974 --> 00:35:13,206
So, what can I do
for my country, Sergeant?

325
00:35:15,247 --> 00:35:16,214
Okay!

326
00:35:19,251 --> 00:35:22,049
I'd like to be
in Sanjana Bakshi's class

327
00:35:22,655 --> 00:35:24,555
Done! What else, Wing Commander?

328
00:35:24,890 --> 00:35:27,859
And please stop saluting every second.
- Top secret, I know!

329
00:35:29,595 --> 00:35:32,223
May I leave, sir?
- Bye, Cadet Ram!

330
00:35:40,773 --> 00:35:42,070
Don't salute, please.
- Top secret

331
00:35:42,207 --> 00:35:44,573
Sir, there is a student in
your college. Lakshman Prasad Sharma

332
00:35:44,810 --> 00:35:47,108
Do you know him?

333
00:35:47,947 --> 00:35:51,178
Just a distant relative!
You must know him

334
00:35:51,617 --> 00:35:54,848
No, I don't.
I can't even remember names

335
00:35:57,556 --> 00:36:01,515
Don't worry. Go to the ID office
at 9:30 sharp

336
00:36:01,961 --> 00:36:04,623
You'll get all the information.
Okay? All the best

337
00:36:05,264 --> 00:36:07,528
Over and out.
Tango and Cash!

338
00:36:08,567 --> 00:36:10,535
Each man for himself!
- Okay!

339
00:36:19,645 --> 00:36:21,545
Roger!
- Major, sir

340
00:36:23,015 --> 00:36:24,539
Come on, Comrade

341
00:36:53,145 --> 00:36:55,045
"Oh brother! Where art thou?"

342
00:36:55,547 --> 00:36:57,845
"My dear..."

343
00:36:58,217 --> 00:37:01,050
"I look for you..."

344
00:37:01,787 --> 00:37:04,517
"night and day..."

345
00:37:05,024 --> 00:37:07,857
"in every way"

346
00:37:09,194 --> 00:37:11,526
"My dear..."

347
00:37:12,031 --> 00:37:14,864
"I look for you"

348
00:37:15,567 --> 00:37:18,035
"night and day..."

349
00:37:18,704 --> 00:37:21,537
"in every way"

350
00:37:22,174 --> 00:37:25,041
"Call me..."

351
00:37:25,577 --> 00:37:28,045
"show me where
you're hiding"

352
00:37:28,914 --> 00:37:30,677
"Where are you...?"

353
00:37:30,849 --> 00:37:32,339
"I'm here feeling blue"

354
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:36,548
What do you say, Bro?

355
00:38:18,630 --> 00:38:21,599
Hello.
May I sit with you?

356
00:38:22,901 --> 00:38:25,062
You, here...?
- Hello uncle

357
00:38:25,571 --> 00:38:27,869
The senior citizen bench is there.
- Shut up

358
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:40,718
What...? What are you doing?
Please make yourself comfortable

359
00:38:41,386 --> 00:38:43,547
Three years of house-warming
should qualify this as your home

360
00:38:43,922 --> 00:38:46,117
In fact, please consider
this your bedroom

361
00:38:46,592 --> 00:38:48,890
Thank you, sir. You're too kind!
- That's me!

362
00:38:52,865 --> 00:38:55,129
Sanju, a round cap today, eh?

363
00:38:55,601 --> 00:38:57,569
I'll get you
a cowboy hat tomorrow, okay?

364
00:38:59,271 --> 00:39:02,104
And why are you sitting?
Please lie down

365
00:39:02,608 --> 00:39:04,838
In fact, on her lap.
I won't mind, and neither will she

366
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:08,847
You...?

367
00:39:09,615 --> 00:39:11,173
Sit, sit

368
00:39:12,684 --> 00:39:14,584
You're new?
- Yes sir

369
00:39:14,786 --> 00:39:16,754
Then get comfy!
- I'm okay, sir

370
00:39:17,089 --> 00:39:20,581
Relax. No, this isn't
a Temple of Knowledge

371
00:39:21,260 --> 00:39:23,592
This is a club.
Am I not right?

372
00:39:24,630 --> 00:39:26,257
Please put your feet up.
- No, sir

373
00:39:26,398 --> 00:39:29,959
No I insist that you keep
your feet up. Please

374
00:39:30,302 --> 00:39:31,326
Up...?
- Please

375
00:39:31,970 --> 00:39:35,599
My feet...?
- Come on, please!

376
00:39:36,308 --> 00:39:38,606
Okay, if you insist, sir.
I'll be fine

377
00:39:39,211 --> 00:39:41,611
How dare you!

378
00:39:43,048 --> 00:39:46,609
How dare you!
I'm going to set you right!

379
00:39:46,985 --> 00:39:48,612
But sir...?
- Come with me to the principal

380
00:39:49,988 --> 00:39:52,218
Follow me. I said, follow me!

381
00:39:53,659 --> 00:39:56,150
Sir, if you walk ahead,
I'd be able to

382
00:39:56,595 --> 00:39:59,086
Oh! You will teach me, eh?
Come on!

383
00:39:59,631 --> 00:40:00,962
And quiet!

384
00:40:05,671 --> 00:40:07,639
And no talking while I'm gone...
It's the principal

385
00:40:08,073 --> 00:40:09,301
I was just coming to you

386
00:40:09,675 --> 00:40:12,576
I want to expel this
not-so-young man immediately!

387
00:40:12,945 --> 00:40:15,573
Go to my office and collect
your Leaving Certificate immediately

388
00:40:16,615 --> 00:40:19,175
Mr Rasai, there is a new student
in your class. Ram Sharma

389
00:40:19,384 --> 00:40:21,579
Sir, I'm Ram Sharma.
- Major!

390
00:40:22,821 --> 00:40:25,585
I mean, Majoring in physics.
Follow me

391
00:40:30,362 --> 00:40:32,990
Class! This is
our new student Ram Sharma

392
00:40:33,966 --> 00:40:37,595
Ten years back due to
some family responsibilities...

393
00:40:38,036 --> 00:40:39,765
he had to abandon his education

394
00:40:40,038 --> 00:40:42,939
But now he's back to complete
his graduation

395
00:40:45,978 --> 00:40:48,606
I want you all
to be friends with him

396
00:40:49,081 --> 00:40:50,810
Now who will be his friend?

397
00:40:55,587 --> 00:40:56,554
Sanjana!

398
00:41:22,781 --> 00:41:24,749
I hope she doesn't know
you're shadowing her

399
00:41:25,284 --> 00:41:27,252
No, sir. Not at all

400
00:41:33,625 --> 00:41:34,592
How is she?

401
00:41:40,432 --> 00:41:42,161
What have I done?
- She's different

402
00:41:42,801 --> 00:41:44,598
Are you two friends?

403
00:41:47,773 --> 00:41:51,732
Ram, I don't like being
compelled to be a friend

404
00:41:52,644 --> 00:41:54,874
Fine.
- I choose my friends

405
00:41:55,914 --> 00:41:59,543
And they are very special.
And you're not

406
00:42:01,586 --> 00:42:03,554
Are you two friends, Ram?

407
00:42:03,922 --> 00:42:06,049
Not yet. But we will be

408
00:42:12,664 --> 00:42:15,155
There are two commandos
stationed outside the hostel at night

409
00:42:20,272 --> 00:42:22,570
You don't have to worry
with me around, sir

410
00:42:24,042 --> 00:42:26,010
Everything is just fine here

411
00:42:28,714 --> 00:42:30,682
And father,
you don't worry too

412
00:42:32,084 --> 00:42:34,052
I'm here now

413
00:42:34,619 --> 00:42:38,578
I'll find them,
I'm sure they are close by...

414
00:42:40,025 --> 00:42:41,253
near me...

415
00:42:42,761 --> 00:42:45,730
Lucky, did you speak to anyone?
- Yeah. I've put an advertisement...

416
00:42:45,964 --> 00:42:48,159
up on the notice board.
We'll find someone real soon

417
00:42:48,367 --> 00:42:50,597
Fix the fuse, Lucky!
The lights keep going out

418
00:42:51,970 --> 00:42:53,870
Did I not ask you to
And your dinner?

419
00:43:27,606 --> 00:43:29,369
Welcome to Darjeeling, Raghavan

420
00:44:06,244 --> 00:44:08,212
It was a choice I had to make
for the sake...

421
00:44:08,580 --> 00:44:12,141
of my little brother's education.
I had to quit college

422
00:44:12,784 --> 00:44:15,548
But I always felt incomplete

423
00:44:16,054 --> 00:44:20,548
And one day as I ticked
'under graduate' in a form...

424
00:44:21,226 --> 00:44:23,194
I decided that as soon
as my brother finishes his studies...

425
00:44:23,595 --> 00:44:25,563
I don't want to hear your saga

426
00:44:25,931 --> 00:44:28,661
I'm not interested in you
or your brother

427
00:44:30,936 --> 00:44:33,564
Fine! Let's talk about you.
Where you from?

428
00:44:33,839 --> 00:44:36,069
What does your dad do?

429
00:44:56,561 --> 00:44:58,688
What's up, Sanju?
- Lucky...

430
00:44:58,897 --> 00:45:01,866
Ram has turned into my shadow!
- Who? Our uncle?

431
00:45:02,734 --> 00:45:05,532
It's the first time
a guy's after you. Enjoy, baby

432
00:45:05,737 --> 00:45:08,865
What are you saying?
- Maybe she wants another guy, Lucky

433
00:45:12,577 --> 00:45:14,875
Mini darling.
I'll be back in a blink

434
00:45:16,615 --> 00:45:18,708
Hey micro-mini! Watch it

435
00:45:31,596 --> 00:45:32,824
Hey Uncle!

436
00:45:34,599 --> 00:45:35,896
Bell Bottoms!

437
00:45:37,669 --> 00:45:38,897
Dude...

438
00:45:41,006 --> 00:45:44,567
are you deaf?
- Selectively, yes!

439
00:45:45,610 --> 00:45:48,579
What's up, man? Why don't you stick
with people your age?

440
00:45:49,114 --> 00:45:52,948
Hang on!
There aren't any here

441
00:45:54,553 --> 00:45:57,078
Is this how you talk to your elders?
- Look Mr Geriatric...

442
00:45:57,589 --> 00:46:00,524
go do what old people do.
Sanju's my friend

443
00:46:01,226 --> 00:46:03,854
So stop bugging her, or else...

444
00:46:07,566 --> 00:46:08,863
Else what?

445
00:46:09,834 --> 00:46:14,203
For you, I'll shut eyes and count
till ten... not the usual three

446
00:46:15,240 --> 00:46:18,209
And when I open my eyes,
you better have disappeared

447
00:46:22,581 --> 00:46:24,549
I think so.
- Thinking's good for you

448
00:46:35,594 --> 00:46:39,553
Where are you running?
Am I a witch?

449
00:46:42,267 --> 00:46:44,235
I'm coming... don't go away

450
00:46:51,610 --> 00:46:53,840
Uncle, I hope
you've left for good

451
00:46:56,214 --> 00:46:59,513
That's Sanju!
- You failed again!

452
00:46:59,951 --> 00:47:03,182
Yet again! And this time
you've broken even my record

453
00:47:04,556 --> 00:47:06,956
How did you manage
to get 3.5% in Hindi?

454
00:47:07,559 --> 00:47:11,120
Tell you what, if you pass this year
I'll give you a "Cadabury"...

455
00:47:11,563 --> 00:47:13,531
that too a milky one!
- Come again

456
00:47:13,765 --> 00:47:17,257
She means Milk Cadbury.
- Yes, milk one!

457
00:47:18,069 --> 00:47:20,867
Sweet boy!
And where's the other one?

458
00:47:21,306 --> 00:47:23,206
Student name?
- Lakshman Prasad Sharma

459
00:47:23,575 --> 00:47:25,202
Your name?
- Ram Sharma

460
00:47:25,577 --> 00:47:27,545
Can't give another student's
information to you

461
00:47:27,912 --> 00:47:29,880
Just find out if...

462
00:47:33,184 --> 00:47:35,880
Want information? We'll take it out
from the college computer...

463
00:47:36,321 --> 00:47:38,881
during the lunch break!
Piece of cake

464
00:47:53,605 --> 00:47:55,505
How much longer?
- Almost done

465
00:48:03,348 --> 00:48:05,942
This is a race between
Lucky and Vivek

466
00:48:06,885 --> 00:48:09,513
Lucky, who is our favourite

467
00:48:10,755 --> 00:48:12,814
And Vivek, who is a bit angry

468
00:48:13,658 --> 00:48:17,116
So whoever runs upto the roof...

469
00:48:17,796 --> 00:48:21,527
and gets the college flag
for Mini gets a huge...

470
00:48:21,733 --> 00:48:23,860
Are you mad?
I'd just said race!

471
00:48:26,638 --> 00:48:28,538
You guys will be rusticated!

472
00:48:31,242 --> 00:48:33,210
Why? Are you scared, Lucky?

473
00:48:45,757 --> 00:48:46,724
Done!

474
00:49:22,393 --> 00:49:24,588
What's going on?
- Sir, a race is on

475
00:49:24,996 --> 00:49:28,932
No one told me it's Sports Day!
Yeah! Race!

476
00:50:25,723 --> 00:50:27,247
Lucky!

477
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:32,088
Lucky hold on! I'm coming!
Someone do something

478
00:50:51,916 --> 00:50:53,144
Who's that?

479
00:51:00,892 --> 00:51:02,223
Captain Ram!

480
00:51:03,928 --> 00:51:06,123
I mean, I want to make him
the Captain of the Athletic Team

481
00:51:06,598 --> 00:51:08,896
See how fit he is!
Come on Captain, come on

482
00:51:13,605 --> 00:51:17,234
Who is this "Makko" man!

483
00:51:28,286 --> 00:51:30,254
Ram turned out to be Rambo!

484
00:51:59,817 --> 00:52:01,216
Let go, Lakshman

485
00:52:03,054 --> 00:52:04,783
Don't look down. Let go

486
00:52:04,989 --> 00:52:07,549
No! Are you mad?
I'll die if I let go!

487
00:52:07,959 --> 00:52:09,927
Give me your hand.
- No...

488
00:52:10,995 --> 00:52:12,724
Don't be scared

489
00:52:13,665 --> 00:52:15,223
I'm here now

490
00:52:16,334 --> 00:52:18,302
Let go

491
00:53:15,593 --> 00:53:17,561
I didn't know you were so fit.
Were you in the army?

492
00:53:19,597 --> 00:53:22,225
Hey, stop that!
You're okay now

493
00:53:23,668 --> 00:53:26,569
No, no, why do you keep
calling me Lakshman?

494
00:53:26,904 --> 00:53:28,565
Because Lakshman your name

495
00:53:30,908 --> 00:53:33,172
But no one knows my real name
in the college

496
00:53:33,878 --> 00:53:37,575
It doesn't go with the image!
You will not squeal, okay?

497
00:53:37,815 --> 00:53:40,579
Okay. Image!
Stop trembling first

498
00:53:42,353 --> 00:53:44,913
And what do you think of my image?
- Your image is set

499
00:53:48,092 --> 00:53:51,255
Idiot! You freaked me out!
Didn't I say it's too dangerous?

500
00:53:51,896 --> 00:53:53,727
What 'Okay'?
What if something had happened?

501
00:53:53,898 --> 00:53:55,798
You didn't even think about
what your mother would go through

502
00:53:56,634 --> 00:53:58,864
How do you know mom?

503
00:54:00,238 --> 00:54:02,536
I don't. I mean...

504
00:54:03,908 --> 00:54:06,877
you must have a mom,
- True. Everybody has a mom

505
00:54:09,580 --> 00:54:12,879
Not everyone.
You are very lucky

506
00:54:17,588 --> 00:54:18,555
Ram...

507
00:54:20,591 --> 00:54:24,550
the other day I had said that
my friends are special people

508
00:54:26,664 --> 00:54:28,564
Well, you are extremely special

509
00:54:38,709 --> 00:54:40,074
What's that?
- Hey uncle...

510
00:54:40,611 --> 00:54:42,169
Okay... come on

511
00:55:02,567 --> 00:55:06,025
Youth! Wonderful thing

512
00:55:08,005 --> 00:55:09,870
Isn't it, Khan?
- Yes, sir!

513
00:55:11,709 --> 00:55:15,543
Such joy! Innocence!
Look at this boy

514
00:55:17,582 --> 00:55:20,142
Has he even thought about
his future...

515
00:55:20,918 --> 00:55:24,547
its dangers?
How it's rife with enemies?

516
00:55:24,956 --> 00:55:27,083
No kid thinks
about these things, Raghavan

517
00:55:30,661 --> 00:55:33,129
It's time to send another message
to General Bakshi

518
00:55:33,764 --> 00:55:35,732
Shoot that boy

519
00:55:36,801 --> 00:55:38,735
Shoot him
while Sanjana is around

520
00:55:39,604 --> 00:55:41,902
And I want a recording of this!

521
00:55:45,042 --> 00:55:47,010
Any problems, Khan?

522
00:55:49,614 --> 00:55:51,582
But he's a kid

523
00:55:54,085 --> 00:55:58,181
This is war, Khan.
Any war needs sacrifices

524
00:55:59,090 --> 00:56:03,857
Our war was for the country
ten years back and still is

525
00:56:05,229 --> 00:56:06,196
Remember?

526
00:56:15,573 --> 00:56:17,541
We found some villagers
at the border...

527
00:56:17,775 --> 00:56:20,266
who claim they got lost searching
for water. They are Pakistanis

528
00:56:22,980 --> 00:56:27,542
You know very well that you are
standing on Indian soil

529
00:56:29,187 --> 00:56:31,155
So get ready for a trial!

530
00:56:36,260 --> 00:56:38,228
Are you Pakistani?

531
00:56:39,597 --> 00:56:42,157
Don't be afraid. Answer calmly

532
00:56:44,135 --> 00:56:46,035
Are you Pakistani?

533
00:56:46,337 --> 00:56:47,304
Yes, sir

534
00:56:49,874 --> 00:56:51,239
Trial over

535
00:57:19,570 --> 00:57:22,539
Major Datta, on what basis
did you kill those eleven Pakistanis?

536
00:57:23,007 --> 00:57:24,975
They were Pakistani spies!
- All of them?

537
00:57:25,643 --> 00:57:27,611
Perhaps.
- Is it possible that...

538
00:57:27,912 --> 00:57:31,211
some of them weren't spies?
- It's possible

539
00:57:31,682 --> 00:57:34,082
And it's also possible that none
of them were spies

540
00:57:34,585 --> 00:57:36,212
They were Pakistanis!

541
00:57:53,004 --> 00:57:55,097
I feel ashamed of having ever
called you a friend

542
00:58:12,890 --> 00:58:14,016
Ten years!

543
00:58:17,762 --> 00:58:19,992
It's taken me ten years
to create my own army

544
00:58:23,567 --> 00:58:29,528
I've handpicked each soldier

545
00:58:31,876 --> 00:58:33,844
I never said it would be easy...

546
00:58:35,112 --> 00:58:37,137
never claimed victory would come
without losing something

547
00:58:37,581 --> 00:58:39,879
If blood must be shed,
then it must, Khan!

548
00:58:40,918 --> 00:58:45,946
It could be ours, the enemies'
or a little boy's

549
00:59:43,678 --> 00:59:48,308
"Who are you waiting for?
I'm here now"

550
00:59:48,750 --> 00:59:53,312
"Just one look,
I'm here now"

551
00:59:54,089 --> 00:59:58,492
"Who are you waiting for?
I'm here now"

552
00:59:59,294 --> 01:00:03,594
"Just one look,
I'm here now"

553
01:00:04,366 --> 01:00:08,928
"Why are you quiet,
why the heavy brow?

554
01:00:09,538 --> 01:00:13,440
"If it's endless love you wish,
ask for it aloud"

555
01:00:14,643 --> 01:00:19,273
"And you shall receive it,
for I'm here now"

556
01:00:20,315 --> 01:00:24,615
"Who are you waiting for?
I'm here now"

557
01:00:25,320 --> 01:00:29,279
"Just one look,
I'm here now"

558
01:01:00,422 --> 01:01:04,324
"When you think,
when you see..."

559
01:01:06,061 --> 01:01:10,020
"how much I love you..."

560
01:01:10,632 --> 01:01:12,600
"Don't stay silent"

561
01:01:13,301 --> 01:01:20,264
"Tell me, you have
that special friend..."

562
01:01:22,110 --> 01:01:26,672
"who will give you
his heart, give up his soul"

563
01:01:32,454 --> 01:01:36,823
"And I will say, true,
for I'm here now"

564
01:01:37,492 --> 01:01:41,622
"Who are you waiting for?
I'm here now"

565
01:01:42,464 --> 01:01:46,992
"Just one look,
I'm here now"

566
01:01:48,103 --> 01:01:52,733
"Why are you quiet,
why the heavy brow?"

567
01:01:53,341 --> 01:01:57,675
"If it's endless love you wish,
ask for it aloud"

568
01:01:58,280 --> 01:02:02,717
"And you shall receive it,
for I'm here now"

569
01:02:03,285 --> 01:02:07,654
"Who are you waiting for?
I'm here now"

570
01:02:08,623 --> 01:02:13,253
"Just one look,
I'm here now"

571
01:02:54,936 --> 01:02:58,667
"If there's something
in your heart..."

572
01:02:59,274 --> 01:03:01,242
"tell me"

573
01:03:02,510 --> 01:03:06,674
"No matter what time
of day or night..."

574
01:03:07,282 --> 01:03:08,909
"tell me"

575
01:03:10,385 --> 01:03:14,685
"If problems plague you..."

576
01:03:15,623 --> 01:03:19,684
"or you feel down and out..."

577
01:03:20,328 --> 01:03:22,592
"tell me"

578
01:03:28,770 --> 01:03:32,866
"If you have a wish,
a little want..."

579
01:03:33,341 --> 01:03:38,711
"don't ever be apprehensive,
for I'm here now"

580
01:03:44,386 --> 01:03:48,880
"Just one look,
I'm here now"

581
01:03:49,524 --> 01:03:53,551
"Why are you quiet,
why the heavy brow?"

582
01:03:54,763 --> 01:03:58,893
"If it's endless love you wish,
ask for it aloud"

583
01:04:00,268 --> 01:04:04,568
"And you shall receive it,
for I'm here now"

584
01:04:05,273 --> 01:04:09,733
"Who are you waiting for?
"I'm here now"

585
01:04:10,278 --> 01:04:14,840
"Just one look,
I'm here now"

586
01:04:39,107 --> 01:04:41,268
What is this now?
- The loser must face punishment

587
01:04:41,476 --> 01:04:43,944
No look,
I just lost because...

588
01:04:45,313 --> 01:04:46,280
Sit!

589
01:04:46,648 --> 01:04:48,275
And I sit here till when?

590
01:04:48,483 --> 01:04:50,451
Until a girl walks
towards you from there

591
01:04:50,652 --> 01:04:52,950
Girl?
- And until you serenade her!

592
01:04:53,321 --> 01:04:55,721
Girls, singing...
I've never done that

593
01:04:58,026 --> 01:05:00,358
Someone's coming!
- I hope it's not Mrs Kakkad!

594
01:05:01,262 --> 01:05:02,889
Sanju! I can't sing

595
01:05:03,965 --> 01:05:05,626
What the hell am I to sing?

596
01:05:07,268 --> 01:05:12,900
"I'm just a little brave
tin soldier, sing with me..."

597
01:05:14,275 --> 01:05:17,244
I should have stuck to the army.
I need a fresh new song... yes

598
01:05:17,745 --> 01:05:21,237
"Buffalo soldier
...in the heart of..."

599
01:05:42,303 --> 01:05:44,771
I got it!
She's the new Chemistry teacher

600
01:05:48,610 --> 01:05:49,736
Ram, don't sing

601
01:05:52,113 --> 01:05:53,375
No singing...

602
01:05:53,681 --> 01:05:55,205
Swan song baby!

603
01:05:59,521 --> 01:06:01,216
Wow! What a lovely sari

604
01:06:10,865 --> 01:06:14,562
"My heart is the moon"

605
01:06:19,007 --> 01:06:22,636
"You are the moonlight"

606
01:06:23,578 --> 01:06:25,910
Just remembered!
Her name is Chandni (moonlight)

607
01:06:26,881 --> 01:06:31,250
"Why is the moonlight..."

608
01:06:33,721 --> 01:06:37,680
"so far from the moon?"

609
01:06:49,637 --> 01:06:53,368
Is it my imagination?
Or were you just singing to me?

610
01:06:54,242 --> 01:06:57,643
No! 'I'm just
a little tin soldier... '

611
01:07:00,248 --> 01:07:01,476
Whatever!

612
01:07:10,558 --> 01:07:13,891
"You have no choice..."

613
01:07:14,929 --> 01:07:18,228
"but to return to my sphere"

614
01:07:19,634 --> 01:07:26,836
"So go where you will,
go my dear"

615
01:07:28,409 --> 01:07:30,240
"Go on, my..."

616
01:07:31,713 --> 01:07:33,578
Don't watch!
You won't be able to bear it

617
01:07:34,282 --> 01:07:37,251
No way! Such behavior
in this college, I will never bear it

618
01:07:37,685 --> 01:07:39,653
By the way, which song was it?

619
01:07:43,291 --> 01:07:45,919
'My heart is the moon... '
- My favourite!

620
01:07:46,628 --> 01:07:48,926
'You are the moonlight... '
- What song is this?

621
01:07:49,731 --> 01:07:51,426
'Why is the moonlight so... '

622
01:07:54,235 --> 01:07:56,965
So old, and a student!
Disgusting!

623
01:07:58,239 --> 01:08:00,764
So young and a teacher! Amazing!

624
01:08:01,309 --> 01:08:03,709
Colonel, do you know
who her father is?

625
01:08:04,245 --> 01:08:06,372
No. Who, sir?
- How the heck do I know?

626
01:08:07,248 --> 01:08:09,876
Admiral, I know she is relevant
to your mission...

627
01:08:10,251 --> 01:08:12,879
No, no...
- But apologize, you must! Go now!

628
01:08:35,276 --> 01:08:38,973
A moonlight!
And what am I an eclipse?

629
01:08:42,450 --> 01:08:43,917
"Makko" man!

630
01:08:53,594 --> 01:08:54,561
You?

631
01:08:55,330 --> 01:08:57,855
How dare you enter
the staff room? No...

632
01:08:58,299 --> 01:09:01,928
don't stop me... I will have you
thrown out of the college, get that?

633
01:09:03,371 --> 01:09:05,601
You punk!

634
01:09:17,385 --> 01:09:19,819
Hey, this was in the 'Matrick'?
- You mean Matrix?

635
01:09:20,021 --> 01:09:20,988
Shut up fatso!

636
01:09:22,323 --> 01:09:25,781
Ms Chandni, if you command me
I'll throw him out!

637
01:09:26,661 --> 01:09:27,628
No, thanks

638
01:09:32,433 --> 01:09:35,300
Shoot!
- Actually they made me kneel...

639
01:09:35,670 --> 01:09:38,468
and so I did because I'm a brave
little tin soldier!

640
01:09:39,340 --> 01:09:42,639
They said a girl will come
and then 'when I saw you I felt... '

641
01:09:43,778 --> 01:09:46,303
'like a blooming rose,
like a poet's prose... '

642
01:09:46,748 --> 01:09:52,880
'like a deer in flight,
like a full-moon night... '

643
01:09:53,354 --> 01:09:55,254
'like an endless search... '

644
01:09:55,623 --> 01:10:00,788
'like the flame of a candle
in a far away church... '

645
01:10:03,464 --> 01:10:06,865
'I saw a girl... '

646
01:10:10,238 --> 01:10:12,035
In front of everyone?

647
01:10:12,673 --> 01:10:15,801
Every time I see her,
I want to sing!

648
01:10:16,310 --> 01:10:19,541
Must be our Chemistry!
- Shut up! Madame Curie!

649
01:10:19,781 --> 01:10:22,614
Go and get the tickets!
- And we'll get the chips

650
01:10:22,850 --> 01:10:23,976
I'll have popcorn

651
01:10:24,318 --> 01:10:26,411
Guys, please stick together!
This place is new to me...

652
01:10:26,754 --> 01:10:27,982
I may get lost

653
01:10:28,656 --> 01:10:30,624
"I'll get lost"
What crap!

654
01:10:38,699 --> 01:10:40,963
Why'd you push?
- Sorry!

655
01:10:46,774 --> 01:10:48,833
Hold this.
How long are they taking, man?

656
01:10:59,887 --> 01:11:03,846
No mistakes, Khan.
I want Gen. Bakshi to know that...

657
01:11:04,859 --> 01:11:06,827
the bullet could be
for his daughter too

658
01:11:09,497 --> 01:11:11,863
Record it. The girl should be
in the frame

659
01:11:48,603 --> 01:11:49,968
What did I do?

660
01:11:59,814 --> 01:12:01,611
In a hurry, my friend?

661
01:14:45,479 --> 01:14:47,743
Looks like
your friends abandoned you

662
01:14:48,015 --> 01:14:49,880
What's to become of you now?

663
01:14:58,325 --> 01:15:00,225
What is he doing here?

664
01:15:00,594 --> 01:15:02,221
He's a student, sir

665
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:09,561
Since?
- About ten days old here

666
01:15:09,904 --> 01:15:10,871
Really?

667
01:15:12,273 --> 01:15:15,242
Major Ram has been protecting her
for the past ten days, and you...

668
01:15:17,445 --> 01:15:21,006
Because of your stupidity,
Khan has been caught

669
01:15:22,049 --> 01:15:24,779
Commander, give me a chance

670
01:15:28,289 --> 01:15:31,781
No Captain.
You don't know Major Ram Sharma!

671
01:15:32,960 --> 01:15:34,723
He's the best

672
01:15:38,699 --> 01:15:41,600
My departed friend Shekhar's son.
Looks I'll have to deal with him...

673
01:15:41,902 --> 01:15:42,869
myself

674
01:15:44,305 --> 01:15:46,273
It's going to be fun.
Gentlemen...

675
01:15:46,841 --> 01:15:49,935
I promise you victory, and
that we will celebrate it with Khan

676
01:16:09,663 --> 01:16:11,494
Who is Raghavan?

677
01:16:13,067 --> 01:16:14,898
Our commander.
- A terrorist!

678
01:16:15,803 --> 01:16:18,829
A soldier who can die
for his country!

679
01:16:19,673 --> 01:16:21,641
No! He can only kill

680
01:16:22,476 --> 01:16:24,740
What war is he going to win
by killing a young boy?

681
01:16:25,279 --> 01:16:28,578
And what war are you fighting
by garlanding the enemies?

682
01:16:28,849 --> 01:16:30,612
We don't want war,
we want friendship!

683
01:16:32,820 --> 01:16:35,914
It's shameful that you have
sold yourself to friendship...

684
01:16:36,290 --> 01:16:38,258
and we have to do your job

685
01:16:38,459 --> 01:16:40,825
You may be in the army
but we are the true soldiers

686
01:16:41,695 --> 01:16:43,526
You and your army is useless!

687
01:16:44,999 --> 01:16:47,832
You are fortunate, Khan, that you're
in front of an officer of the Army

688
01:16:48,903 --> 01:16:51,633
If we were like you, then
you'd have been dead by now

689
01:16:55,576 --> 01:16:57,544
We have orders to take him
to the headquarters

690
01:16:57,845 --> 01:16:59,813
Put it on hold!
Keep interrogating him

691
01:17:00,948 --> 01:17:02,916
Though, I doubt if he'll talk

692
01:17:03,684 --> 01:17:05,652
Is my jeep ready?
- Sir, where are you going?

693
01:17:06,921 --> 01:17:08,889
To college.
To complete my studies

694
01:17:10,791 --> 01:17:13,225
If the atomic weight of Oxygen
is sixteen...

695
01:17:15,262 --> 01:17:18,493
can anyone tell me
the atomic weight of Calcium?

696
01:17:54,235 --> 01:17:56,203
The atomic weight...
- Oh please let them be

697
01:17:57,471 --> 01:17:59,701
Your hair look beautiful
when you let them fly

698
01:18:01,909 --> 01:18:04,707
Really! When your hair falls
on your face it's like...

699
01:18:05,346 --> 01:18:11,717
'I saw a girl and felt..."

700
01:18:12,353 --> 01:18:14,617
'like a blooming rose... '

701
01:18:45,319 --> 01:18:48,584
"Now that you're here,
and so am I..."

702
01:18:49,490 --> 01:18:52,926
"come a little closer
so I could try..."

703
01:18:54,295 --> 01:18:57,594
"to tell you
how madly I love you"

704
01:19:05,606 --> 01:19:09,269
"When I first saw you
and began to get to know you..."

705
01:19:10,311 --> 01:19:13,747
"I lost my sense of time"

706
01:19:14,581 --> 01:19:18,449
"The fragrance of your body
cast a spell on me"

707
01:19:19,320 --> 01:19:23,279
"And I lost my heart"

708
01:20:09,636 --> 01:20:12,605
"Why are you this beautiful?"

709
01:20:13,307 --> 01:20:17,266
"It makes us all wonder
and believe in things like fairies"

710
01:20:17,811 --> 01:20:19,779
"Though your beauty
pales them to a blur"

711
01:20:20,314 --> 01:20:23,943
"So, why are you beautiful?"

712
01:20:24,385 --> 01:20:28,947
"That makes one speechless.
I'm lost and in a mess..."

713
01:20:29,323 --> 01:20:31,018
"I'm obsessed"

714
01:20:31,558 --> 01:20:34,857
"I worshipped you,
I desired only you"

715
01:20:36,096 --> 01:20:39,759
"When I first saw you,
and began to get to know you..."

716
01:20:40,334 --> 01:20:45,294
"I lost my sense of time"

717
01:21:19,606 --> 01:21:23,269
"Now that you're here
and so am I..."

718
01:21:23,977 --> 01:21:27,879
"come a little closer
so I could tell you..."

719
01:21:28,649 --> 01:21:31,948
"what magic came over me
when I first met your eye"

720
01:21:33,554 --> 01:21:37,285
"My first thoughts of you,
when I realized you..."

721
01:21:38,025 --> 01:21:41,756
"when I really saw you,
and began to know you..."

722
01:21:42,629 --> 01:21:46,588
"I lost my sense of time"

723
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:50,868
"The fragrance of your body
cast a spell on me"

724
01:21:51,772 --> 01:21:55,572
"And my heart slipped"

725
01:22:30,043 --> 01:22:32,841
Violins are playing.
In college

726
01:22:34,715 --> 01:22:37,275
Ram? With a teacher? These will
turn into your funeral trumpets

727
01:22:40,320 --> 01:22:42,447
Look at that.
- You saw that?

728
01:22:42,723 --> 01:22:44,452
Nobody can see that

729
01:22:44,691 --> 01:22:47,285
I've had this up for so many days
with no response

730
01:22:47,494 --> 01:22:50,588
This is the problem of our college.
No respect, no discipline

731
01:22:50,964 --> 01:22:52,932
Whoever did this has had it

732
01:22:57,070 --> 01:23:00,233
Lucky needs a tenant!
I'm here now

733
01:23:02,276 --> 01:23:04,574
Are you sure you won't have
any problems with me at home?

734
01:23:04,945 --> 01:23:08,676
No problems. Grandpa's room is empty
and money's a bit tight right now

735
01:23:09,283 --> 01:23:11,251
And if you're around,
mom will love you

736
01:23:11,451 --> 01:23:13,851
Mom will love me?
- She always wanted a son like you...

737
01:23:14,354 --> 01:23:18,586
Clean. But got me instead!
You two will get along superbly

738
01:23:18,959 --> 01:23:21,757
And wait till you
taste her cooking

739
01:23:22,629 --> 01:23:26,929
Mom's cooking!
- Yeah, she has only two missions

740
01:23:27,367 --> 01:23:30,268
One, to reform me.
Two, to feed everyone

741
01:23:32,539 --> 01:23:34,507
And your dad?

742
01:23:39,646 --> 01:23:44,811
Ram, you're my friend
and all my friends know this

743
01:23:46,119 --> 01:23:48,451
Do not speak to me
about my father

744
01:23:49,389 --> 01:23:50,356
Never

745
01:24:00,934 --> 01:24:02,902
That's our home

746
01:24:03,604 --> 01:24:05,799
Lakshman,
there's no electricity...?

747
01:24:07,274 --> 01:24:12,906
I'm history! Mom had asked me
to repair the fuse

748
01:24:13,280 --> 01:24:14,907
I'll go and get
the fuse repaired buddy...

749
01:24:15,282 --> 01:24:17,250
you go and calm mom down.
- I'm coming with you...

750
01:24:17,384 --> 01:24:19,352
I'll be back in two minutes!
- No Lakshman, how will I...?

751
01:24:19,686 --> 01:24:21,244
Just two minutes!

752
01:24:23,957 --> 01:24:25,788
But how will I...? Mom...

753
01:25:05,432 --> 01:25:07,400
Are you back, son?

754
01:25:13,373 --> 01:25:15,898
What took you so long?

755
01:25:20,280 --> 01:25:22,248
And why are you so quiet?

756
01:25:23,283 --> 01:25:24,841
I knew you'd forget again

757
01:25:25,285 --> 01:25:27,810
Do you know how long I've been
in darkness? We have a blown fuse

758
01:25:28,322 --> 01:25:30,916
Forget it, I'll scold you later,
but first take the Lord's blessings

759
01:25:31,758 --> 01:25:34,921
Oh Lord, I hope
he passes this year...

760
01:25:35,595 --> 01:25:39,258
makes his mother proud
finds every joy in life

761
01:25:42,636 --> 01:25:44,604
Who...? Who are you?

762
01:25:48,775 --> 01:25:51,073
I thought it's my son...
- I...

763
01:25:52,479 --> 01:25:53,537
I'm...

764
01:25:55,916 --> 01:25:59,977
This is Ram, mom, my friend,
and your new paying guest

765
01:26:01,254 --> 01:26:03,222
Ram, this is mom

766
01:26:04,691 --> 01:26:05,953
I know

767
01:26:13,266 --> 01:26:15,234
He's just your type

768
01:26:22,275 --> 01:26:23,742
Bless you, son

769
01:26:36,842 --> 01:26:38,070
Ram...

770
01:26:40,846 --> 01:26:42,939
here, have it hot

771
01:26:43,382 --> 01:26:46,146
Enough, aunty.
I just had loads... please!

772
01:26:46,519 --> 01:26:48,000
Enough already? You're young,
you need more. Come on
