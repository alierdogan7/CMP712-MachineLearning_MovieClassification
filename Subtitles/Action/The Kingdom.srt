<i>After capturing</i>
<i>most of the Arabian Peninsula</i>

00:00:48,514 --> 00:00:51,075
<i>with the help of</i>
<i>the Wahhabi Islamic warriors,</i>

4
00:00:51,617 --> 00:00:55,884
<i>Ibn Saud establishes</i>
<i>the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.</i>

5
00:00:56,121 --> 00:00:58,522
<i>The Wahhabis</i>
<i>were fiercely anti-Western.</i>

6
00:00:58,591 --> 00:01:00,058
<i>They want to</i>
<i>go back in time</i>

7
00:01:00,125 --> 00:01:03,562
<i>to a pure Islam that wasn't</i>
<i>threatened by the West.</i>

8
00:01:03,629 --> 00:01:06,064
<i>It was by chance</i>
<i>that we discovered oil.</i>

9
00:01:06,131 --> 00:01:08,292
<i>We were looking for water.</i>

10
00:01:08,367 --> 00:01:11,097
<i>Despite criticism</i>
<i>of foreign presence in the Kingdom,</i>

11
00:01:11,171 --> 00:01:14,038
<i>the King allows commercial</i>
<i>oil production to begin.</i>

12
00:01:14,273 --> 00:01:16,673
<i>The result is the first union</i>

13
00:01:16,742 --> 00:01:19,734
<i>between Saudi Arabia</i>
<i>and the United States.</i>

14
00:01:20,579 --> 00:01:21,841
<i>To accommodate</i>
<i>the workforce</i>

15
00:01:21,914 --> 00:01:24,678
<i>the first Western housing</i>
<i>compounds are created.</i>

16
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:27,776
<i>The strict Islamic laws</i>
<i>enforced outside of these walls</i>

17
00:01:27,853 --> 00:01:29,344
<i>do not apply inside.</i>

18
00:01:29,922 --> 00:01:31,685
<i>West and East</i>
<i>came together in Egypt</i>

19
00:01:31,757 --> 00:01:34,658
<i>when President Roosevelt</i>
<i>and Ibn Saud, King of Arabia.. .</i>

20
00:01:34,727 --> 00:01:38,662
<i>They want America</i>
<i>present there in the kingdom</i>

21
00:01:38,731 --> 00:01:41,199
<i>because we are their security.</i>

22
00:01:41,266 --> 00:01:45,829
<i>The Saudi elite became</i>
<i>notorious big spenders and lost credibility</i>

23
00:01:45,905 --> 00:01:48,566
<i>and respect among</i>
<i>religious conservatives.</i>

24
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:51,940
<i>In response to the</i>
<i>U. S. Support of Israel in the Arab-Israeli War,</i>

25
00:01:52,011 --> 00:01:55,378
<i>Wahhabi Muslims pressured</i>
<i>the Saudi monarchy to stop pumping oil.</i>

26
00:01:55,447 --> 00:01:57,678
<i>Those who control</i>
<i>the flow of oil</i>

27
00:01:57,749 --> 00:01:59,683
<i>hold the Western</i>
<i>world hostage.</i>

28
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:03,253
<i>Prices quadruple.</i>

29
00:02:03,322 --> 00:02:07,782
<i>Oil was</i>
<i>an American national security priority.</i>

30
00:02:07,859 --> 00:02:10,089
<i>The embargo</i>
<i>redefined the balance of power</i>

31
00:02:10,161 --> 00:02:12,254
<i>between the oil consumers</i>
<i>and oil producers.</i>

32
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:16,460
<i>Iraq's battle-trained army</i>
<i>swept across Kuwait's borders at first light.</i>

33
00:02:16,534 --> 00:02:19,094
<i>As a Saudi national,</i>
<i>Osama bin Laden offered his services</i>

34
00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:20,501
<i>to the Royals.</i>

35
00:02:20,571 --> 00:02:22,562
<i>bring his army</i>
<i>from Afghanistan</i>

36
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:24,665
<i>to repel the Iraqi invaders</i>
<i>from Kuwait.</i>

37
00:02:24,742 --> 00:02:27,404
<i>But the Saudis</i>
<i>had a better offer.</i>

38
00:02:27,478 --> 00:02:29,970
<i>A half-million troops</i>
<i>from the United States.</i>

39
00:02:33,019 --> 00:02:34,177
<i>His offer rejected,</i>

40
00:02:34,252 --> 00:02:36,982
<i>Osama took to the streets</i>
<i>and mosques to denounce the U. S. ,</i>

41
00:02:37,054 --> 00:02:39,546
<i>the Royal Family</i>
<i>and their unholy alliance.</i>

42
00:02:39,624 --> 00:02:40,921
<i>Osama bin Laden this week</i>

43
00:02:40,992 --> 00:02:43,894
<i>again lashed out</i>
<i>at the Saudi Royal Family.</i>

44
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:47,690
<i>We were tracking</i>
<i>bin Laden since the early '90s.</i>

45
00:02:47,766 --> 00:02:49,666
<i>We stripped him</i>
<i>of his citizenship.</i>

46
00:03:06,818 --> 00:03:09,912
<i>When it became clear</i>
<i>that 15 of the 19 were Saudis,</i>

47
00:03:09,988 --> 00:03:13,389
that was a disaster.
A total disaster.

48
00:03:13,459 --> 00:03:16,222
<i>Because bin Laden, at that moment,</i>
<i>had made, in the minds of Americans,</i>

49
00:03:16,295 --> 00:03:17,421
<i>Saudi Arabia into an enemy.</i>

50
00:03:17,496 --> 00:03:20,955
We are with you to get to...
The perpetrators of

51
00:03:21,033 --> 00:03:24,332
How dare they say
they are Muslim!

52
00:03:24,403 --> 00:03:27,270
<i>This is a nation</i>
<i>where tradition and modernity</i>

53
00:03:27,339 --> 00:03:29,035
<i>are in violent collision.</i>

54
00:03:29,374 --> 00:03:32,173
<i>The Al Qaeda is thought</i>
<i>to have been behind the bombing.</i>

55
00:03:32,244 --> 00:03:37,080
<i>A team of F. B. I. Agents prepare</i>
<i>to investigate the attack in Saudi Arabia.</i>

56
00:03:39,019 --> 00:03:42,749
<i>The latest</i>
<i>terrorist attacks showcase the great division</i>

57
00:03:42,822 --> 00:03:46,986
<i>between the pro-U. S. Monarchy</i>
<i>and the extremist Wahhabi militants</i>

58
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:48,688
<i>within the kingdom.</i>

59
00:03:58,070 --> 00:03:59,505
Yeah, come on! Come on!

60
00:03:59,572 --> 00:04:01,198
Here we go.
Let's go!

61
00:04:01,306 --> 00:04:02,330
Here you go, man.

62
00:04:02,407 --> 00:04:03,634
Hey, thanks.

63
00:04:04,843 --> 00:04:05,935
Yeah!

64
00:04:07,279 --> 00:04:09,110
Hey, guys, you might
want to move back!

65
00:04:09,181 --> 00:04:10,613
Is this what
you're looking at?

66
00:04:10,682 --> 00:04:11,808
Easy.

67
00:04:11,882 --> 00:04:13,316
Out!

68
00:04:13,953 --> 00:04:15,317
Give it up!

69
00:04:16,755 --> 00:04:18,689
Come on, move it!

70
00:04:18,757 --> 00:04:21,088
We need a hit. Come on!

71
00:04:21,158 --> 00:04:23,024
Here we go. No-hitter.

72
00:04:23,128 --> 00:04:24,219
No-hitter.

73
00:04:24,296 --> 00:04:25,628
Come on. Do your worst.

74
00:04:43,182 --> 00:04:44,979
Hello. How are you today,
Sergeant?

75
00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:47,712
Sun is shining.
Wind is blowing.

76
00:04:47,786 --> 00:04:49,048
How bad can I be doing?

77
00:05:01,367 --> 00:05:06,099
And this is the skateboard
that my Grandma Ruth gave to me.

78
00:05:06,171 --> 00:05:10,301
This is my fish Jaws.
And he's a really neat fish.

79
00:05:10,375 --> 00:05:15,210
And this is the day that my daddy says
is the happiest day of his life.

80
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:18,272
Can you tell us
about that day, Mr. Fleury?

81
00:05:20,085 --> 00:05:22,383
Yeah. You guys want to hear it?
You want to hear the story?

82
00:05:23,622 --> 00:05:25,817
Do you want to hear about that day?
Well, I'll tell you what.

83
00:05:25,891 --> 00:05:27,586
This is December 4

84
00:05:27,659 --> 00:05:29,786
and we were at the hospital all day
and most of the night.

85
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:31,055
And we was waiting on
this little man to come out.

86
00:05:31,129 --> 00:05:33,893
And then all of a sudden the doctor
showed up and said, 'He's not coming out.'

87
00:05:35,033 --> 00:05:37,228
'We got to go in and get him.'

88
00:05:38,203 --> 00:05:40,432
Like a search team, right?
So what she did was...

89
00:05:40,506 --> 00:05:42,370
You sure I can
tell this story?

90
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:45,274
So what happened was,
is they took a tiny little knife

91
00:05:45,344 --> 00:05:47,870
then cut right underneath
the belly button,

92
00:05:47,947 --> 00:05:49,038
and they opened her up

93
00:05:49,114 --> 00:05:53,016
and then took her hands and stuck them
all the way in her belly and disappeared.

94
00:05:53,085 --> 00:05:56,078
And she was in there just rustling
and rumbling and looking for something.

95
00:05:56,155 --> 00:05:59,249
Then she started pulling and pulling
and pulling and pulling

96
00:05:59,325 --> 00:06:02,691
and she was pulling,
and all of a sudden she stopped!

97
00:06:03,894 --> 00:06:06,955
Then she looked at me and said,
'Mr. Fleury, are you ready

98
00:06:07,032 --> 00:06:08,397
'to have your world rocked?'

99
00:06:08,467 --> 00:06:10,367
And I said,
'Well, I guess so.'

100
00:06:10,436 --> 00:06:13,029
And so she starts pulling and pulling
and all of a sudden a head popped out.

101
00:06:13,105 --> 00:06:16,165
And I looked down and I said, 'Kevin!'
And then he looked back at me

102
00:06:16,241 --> 00:06:17,732
and he said...
Daddy!

103
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:20,243
Daddy! Yeah.

104
00:06:20,846 --> 00:06:22,143
And that was...

105
00:06:23,883 --> 00:06:25,474
That was the happiest
day of my life.

106
00:06:25,549 --> 00:06:26,847
Say that again!

107
00:08:21,133 --> 00:08:22,293
Roddy!

108
00:08:52,797 --> 00:08:54,628
Please do not panic,
everything okay.

109
00:08:54,699 --> 00:08:56,497
Come. Follow me, please.
Come with me.

110
00:08:56,569 --> 00:08:59,002
Come. Follow me, please.
Come with me.

111
00:09:40,211 --> 00:09:42,203
Fran?
<i>Are you getting this yet?</i>

112
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:44,942
Slow down. I'm at Kevin's school.
What's going on?

113
00:09:45,016 --> 00:09:47,540
Riyadh. We got a lot of bodies
down here, Ronnie.

114
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:50,088
Hold on, I'm going outside.
I can't hear you. Where exactly?

115
00:09:50,156 --> 00:09:52,623
The Al Rahmah Western
Housing Compound.

116
00:09:52,692 --> 00:09:55,388
Oil company employees.
They hit the compound picnic.

117
00:09:55,827 --> 00:09:56,852
How?

118
00:09:56,928 --> 00:09:58,055
Broad fucking daylight.

119
00:09:58,130 --> 00:10:00,427
They blew up a goddamn
softball game, Ronnie.

120
00:10:00,498 --> 00:10:01,965
I mean, kids and everything.

121
00:10:02,034 --> 00:10:03,331
<i>You understand?</i>
When?

122
00:10:03,401 --> 00:10:05,699
<i>An hour ago.</i>
<i>Get them away from there!</i>

123
00:10:06,339 --> 00:10:09,308
An hour ago. One bomber.
Shooter crew for diversion.

124
00:10:11,142 --> 00:10:13,303
Over there! Jesus Christ.

125
00:10:13,379 --> 00:10:14,437
Fran, you okay?

126
00:10:14,513 --> 00:10:16,275
Get them
on the far side.

127
00:10:18,383 --> 00:10:20,681
Yeah, I'm fine. Listen to me, Ronnie.
You got to get out here.

128
00:10:20,753 --> 00:10:22,948
Do you understand me?
You got to get out here.

129
00:10:23,022 --> 00:10:24,387
Don't take no for an answer.

130
00:10:24,456 --> 00:10:26,015
<i>All right, I hear you.</i>
<i>I hear you.</i>

131
00:10:26,092 --> 00:10:27,581
They're not gonna say no.
<i>Good.</i>

132
00:10:27,659 --> 00:10:28,648
All right.

133
00:10:30,962 --> 00:10:34,159
Hey. Look, Daddy's got to
go to work. All right?

134
00:10:34,232 --> 00:10:35,460
We're gonna do ceramics.

135
00:10:35,533 --> 00:10:36,694
We're gonna do what?
Ceramics?

136
00:10:36,769 --> 00:10:38,531
Well, we'll do ceramics
when I get back, okay?

137
00:10:38,603 --> 00:10:39,661
Who was that?

138
00:10:39,738 --> 00:10:41,035
That was Uncle Fran.

139
00:10:41,107 --> 00:10:43,200
Uncle Fran? What happened?

140
00:10:43,275 --> 00:10:45,334
Some bad things happened.

141
00:10:46,312 --> 00:10:48,279
A lot of bad people out there?

142
00:10:48,347 --> 00:10:50,975
Yeah. But you are not one of them.

143
00:11:12,837 --> 00:11:13,827
Hey, Rex?

144
00:11:16,041 --> 00:11:19,033
How old were you
when your hat was that small?

145
00:11:23,281 --> 00:11:25,249
Come on, buddy.
You got to get up.

146
00:11:25,584 --> 00:11:26,710
We got work to do.

147
00:11:36,928 --> 00:11:39,898
Well, we got to clear out this perimeter.
We got to...

148
00:11:39,965 --> 00:11:41,727
I got...
We got to preserve

149
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:43,427
Get Jack and Steve
to cover on the far side.

150
00:11:53,111 --> 00:11:54,443
<i>The initial attack,</i>

151
00:11:54,513 --> 00:11:56,378
<i>involving a suicide bomber</i>
<i>and at least two gunmen.. .</i>

152
00:11:56,449 --> 00:11:57,643
<i>... was apparently designed</i>
<i>to lure.. .</i>

153
00:11:57,717 --> 00:11:58,876
<i>REPORTER 2:... <i>in and around</i></i>
<i>the Al Rahmah.. .</i>

154
00:11:58,950 --> 00:12:00,315
<i>... first responders</i>
<i>to the scene.. .</i>

155
00:12:00,384 --> 00:12:01,751
<i>... Western housing complex</i>
<i>near Riyadh.</i>

156
00:12:01,821 --> 00:12:03,584
<i>... followed by</i>
<i>a massive secondary explosion.</i>

157
00:12:03,656 --> 00:12:06,750
Numbers so far, 100 plus killed,
200 plus injured.

158
00:12:06,826 --> 00:12:08,726
Target was a softball game.

159
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:12,661
The killers wore Saudi
police uniforms. Special...

160
00:12:16,202 --> 00:12:18,066
Special Agent Fran Manner
was killed.

161
00:12:42,762 --> 00:12:45,356
Grant? Take a stab
at the bomb sizes.

162
00:12:47,801 --> 00:12:53,567
From the craters it looks like they used
a high explosive, possibly military grade.

163
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:56,638
Twenty, thirty pounds
of P. E. T. N.

164
00:12:56,709 --> 00:12:58,142
That's something
that they have.

165
00:12:58,611 --> 00:13:01,705
Semtex or C-4
if they could get it.

166
00:13:02,046 --> 00:13:03,981
That there. God knows.

167
00:13:04,048 --> 00:13:07,815
That crater looks like a plane
dropped a 500-pounder.

168
00:13:07,887 --> 00:13:10,617
Sir? I, already know the answer to this,
but is there any chance in hell

169
00:13:10,689 --> 00:13:12,589
we get to go over there
and use our hands?

170
00:13:12,658 --> 00:13:15,023
If you already know the answer,
why ask the question?

171
00:13:15,094 --> 00:13:16,186
Just thought I'd ask.

172
00:13:16,262 --> 00:13:18,389
Look, we're not seeing
this kind of planning and execution

173
00:13:18,464 --> 00:13:19,863
anywhere else, are we?
No.

174
00:13:19,931 --> 00:13:22,229
I mean, these ain't hot-wired
artillery shells

175
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:24,462
waiting for Humvees
to roll by.

176
00:13:24,937 --> 00:13:26,495
These hits are coordinated.

177
00:13:26,571 --> 00:13:30,530
The planning, timing in big,
broad-daylight, balls-out ugly.

178
00:13:30,608 --> 00:13:31,632
So fucking greedy.

179
00:13:31,709 --> 00:13:34,007
Do we know if they used the uniforms
in the other two attacks?

180
00:13:34,077 --> 00:13:36,343
No, as far as I know
this is the first time for that.

181
00:13:36,415 --> 00:13:39,611
Then you're saying now they got
access to Saudi uniforms?

182
00:13:39,684 --> 00:13:41,709
I mean, baby Jesus!

183
00:13:41,786 --> 00:13:43,981
Is anybody taking credit?
Anybody seen anything on the web?

184
00:13:44,055 --> 00:13:45,614
Haven't heard anything.
Tom, you got anything?

185
00:13:45,690 --> 00:13:46,714
We haven't found anything yet.

186
00:13:46,792 --> 00:13:48,623
How do we know
it's not Saudi on Saudi?

187
00:13:48,694 --> 00:13:52,687
Could be. If it's Saudi, then it's
quite probably the work of Abu Hamza.

188
00:13:52,765 --> 00:13:55,562
Osama wannabe.
Lived in Iraq. Afghanistan.

189
00:13:55,633 --> 00:13:57,226
Sir, not to beat a dead horse,

190
00:13:57,303 --> 00:14:00,567
but if there was ever a time for us
to put boots on Saudi sand,

191
00:14:00,638 --> 00:14:01,866
I mean,
don't you think this is it?

192
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:04,000
There's no way, Adam.
They will never allow it.

193
00:14:04,076 --> 00:14:05,407
Then let's just ask.

194
00:14:05,477 --> 00:14:08,343
The Saudi Royal Family cannot appear
as if they're losing control.

195
00:14:08,414 --> 00:14:11,076
If they lose control of their country,
lose control of the people,

196
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:13,083
they risk losing
control of the oil.

197
00:14:13,151 --> 00:14:14,140
And that is not gonna happen.

198
00:14:15,487 --> 00:14:17,113
State Department.

199
00:14:18,591 --> 00:14:20,820
'We are in agreement
with the Saudi security assessment

200
00:14:20,892 --> 00:14:24,886
'that any additional American presence
on kingdom soil represents reckless risk.'

201
00:14:24,964 --> 00:14:26,556
Oh, come on, risk?
Yeah.

202
00:14:26,631 --> 00:14:29,157
What's that?
That's not a reckless risk?

203
00:14:29,235 --> 00:14:30,259
Fuck it.

204
00:14:31,569 --> 00:14:33,833
You hang tight.
I'm gonna go get access.

205
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:37,267
Keep your bags packed.
Keep your phones on.

206
00:14:37,343 --> 00:14:38,775
Some of you are gonna
get some calls.

207
00:17:02,821 --> 00:17:05,255
Everyone's terrified,
so nothing moves.

208
00:17:05,324 --> 00:17:07,383
You and your team
aren't going anywhere

209
00:17:07,459 --> 00:17:09,790
and this meeting's
just a circle jerk, Ronnie.

210
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:11,920
Attorney General Young is
gonna go through the motions

211
00:17:11,996 --> 00:17:14,191
because protocol says
we get an appeal.

212
00:17:14,265 --> 00:17:16,666
We'll be on record,
but you expect nothing more.

213
00:17:17,636 --> 00:17:20,297
I met with Prince Thamer
at Saudi Embassy

214
00:17:20,371 --> 00:17:22,669
15 minutes after hearing
this morning's news.

215
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:24,765
And after speaking
with Thamer,

216
00:17:24,843 --> 00:17:27,709
I advised withholding
additional U. S. Personnel,

217
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:30,510
because a large part
of the religious justification

218
00:17:30,582 --> 00:17:34,642
for these bombs is the presence
of current U. S. Personnel.

219
00:17:34,787 --> 00:17:36,549
More boots on Saudi soil

220
00:17:36,621 --> 00:17:38,419
is only gonna make
an already combustible situation

221
00:17:38,490 --> 00:17:39,957
that much more so.

222
00:17:40,024 --> 00:17:41,253
My two cents.

223
00:17:41,393 --> 00:17:44,157
The Saudis have not asked for F. B. I. Help.
They've done the opposite.

224
00:17:44,228 --> 00:17:47,858
This is just going to further complicate
an already deteriorating situation

225
00:17:47,933 --> 00:17:50,697
with one of our few remaining
allies in the Middle East.

226
00:17:50,769 --> 00:17:51,757
Rock solid logic.

227
00:17:51,837 --> 00:17:55,000
Well, we would like to be on the record
as saying the F. B. I. Would like

228
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:59,272
an Evidence Response Team
on the ground in Riyadh now.

229
00:17:59,878 --> 00:18:03,939
Doesn't your team in that country
represent exactly the kind

230
00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:08,051
of target that these masters
would die for?

231
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:10,350
They'd trade 10 of their own
for one of you.

232
00:18:10,422 --> 00:18:13,721
Not to go after criminals
because they might try to harm you

233
00:18:13,792 --> 00:18:15,782
is really not
a policy of the F. B. I.

234
00:18:15,994 --> 00:18:17,586
See, we try not to say uncle.

235
00:18:18,062 --> 00:18:19,086
We try.

236
00:18:19,163 --> 00:18:20,687
Let me put it to you
another way.

237
00:18:20,765 --> 00:18:22,996
Al Qaeda lost the first phase
of this war.

238
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:24,090
And they know it.

239
00:18:24,335 --> 00:18:26,497
So a new zero-sum phase
has begun.

240
00:18:26,638 --> 00:18:28,572
'If you're a Westerner
or a moderate Arab

241
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:32,439
'and you won't join us, we will let loose
the truly talented murderers.'

242
00:18:32,510 --> 00:18:34,103
Men like Abu Hamza.

243
00:18:34,346 --> 00:18:35,813
These are
operational commanders

244
00:18:35,881 --> 00:18:40,715
who plan, organize, train, brainwash,
preach extreme violence.

245
00:18:41,419 --> 00:18:43,512
These are the men
we're fighting.

246
00:18:43,588 --> 00:18:44,714
Duly noted.

247
00:18:45,424 --> 00:18:46,686
Anything else?

248
00:18:48,827 --> 00:18:51,318
Now, as far as
the public's concerned

249
00:18:51,996 --> 00:18:55,022
let's try to view this
through F. B. I. Agents' eyes.

250
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:56,122
Is that clear?

251
00:18:59,437 --> 00:19:03,932
Sir, how do you suppose this is viewed
through F. B. I. Agents' eyes?

252
00:19:04,242 --> 00:19:05,335
Pardon me?

253
00:19:06,511 --> 00:19:10,345
I said, in this situation,
how do you feel this is viewed

254
00:19:10,415 --> 00:19:12,042
through our eyes?

255
00:19:14,119 --> 00:19:15,711
It's a variation of vengeance.

256
00:19:15,787 --> 00:19:19,518
When one of your own is killed,
agents lose their analytical skills.

257
00:19:19,591 --> 00:19:20,615
Kind of like a...

258
00:19:20,692 --> 00:19:22,319
Thirty-six hours.

259
00:19:24,296 --> 00:19:26,696
We don't do it in 36 hours,
we can forget it.

260
00:19:26,765 --> 00:19:28,790
Agent Fleury, Agent Mayes,

261
00:19:30,168 --> 00:19:32,694
I appreciate your passion.
Quite spirited.

262
00:19:32,771 --> 00:19:36,331
If you were running the F. B. I. ,
you might turn it into Patton's Third Army.

263
00:19:36,407 --> 00:19:38,273
Might be a good idea,
I don't know.

264
00:19:47,752 --> 00:19:50,722
My daddy used to fly a helicopter
up in Saudi Arabia.

265
00:19:50,788 --> 00:19:52,415
Is that right?
Now, where would he sit?

266
00:19:52,490 --> 00:19:54,459
Would he sit either here,
or would he sit over there?

267
00:19:54,526 --> 00:19:56,390
No, he used to sit
right here.

268
00:19:56,461 --> 00:19:57,758
And you want to know a secret?

269
00:19:57,829 --> 00:19:59,023
What?

270
00:19:59,097 --> 00:20:01,725
My daddy died in Saudi Arabia.

271
00:20:03,468 --> 00:20:06,333
Yeah. Your daddy died
in Saudi Arabia.

272
00:20:08,306 --> 00:20:09,797
You know your daddy
was my friend, right?

273
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:11,239
Yeah.

274
00:20:11,309 --> 00:20:13,107
So that means
that now you're my friend.

275
00:20:13,178 --> 00:20:14,406
Yeah.

276
00:20:16,447 --> 00:20:19,383
So, since we're friends
you promise to take me flying

277
00:20:19,451 --> 00:20:21,476
when you know
how to fly this helicopter?

278
00:20:21,553 --> 00:20:22,848
Good. Good.

279
00:20:22,921 --> 00:20:24,615
What sound does it make
when it takes off?

280
00:20:26,358 --> 00:20:27,347
Yeah.

281
00:20:29,428 --> 00:20:30,951
What about...

282
00:20:32,162 --> 00:20:34,723
Yeah, like that, huh?

283
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:36,665
That's when it's coming in.

284
00:21:24,615 --> 00:21:27,278
How hard you gonna hit
the Royal Family tomorrow in your column?

285
00:21:27,352 --> 00:21:29,149
I'm gonna hit them
with a fucking sledgehammer.

286
00:21:29,221 --> 00:21:32,554
The bombings or other things?

287
00:21:32,624 --> 00:21:33,612
What's other
than the bombings?

288
00:21:33,691 --> 00:21:36,388
I know you've been tracking
our investigation on Al-Haramain, right?

289
00:21:36,461 --> 00:21:40,022
Yeah. Royal Family's donations
that end up blowing shit up.

290
00:21:40,099 --> 00:21:42,397
Yeah. Seat's taken.

291
00:21:44,469 --> 00:21:46,095
I need a favor.

292
00:21:46,170 --> 00:21:47,468
I don't do favors, Ronnie.

293
00:21:47,539 --> 00:21:49,837
Listen, Elaine, when this thing breaks
and it's gonna be real,

294
00:21:49,908 --> 00:21:50,932
I'm gonna bring it
to you first.

295
00:21:51,009 --> 00:21:53,034
I'm listening.

296
00:21:53,912 --> 00:21:55,641
I need you to call Thamer
at the Embassy,

297
00:21:55,714 --> 00:21:57,442
tell him that the F. B. I.
Is getting ready

298
00:21:57,515 --> 00:22:01,680
to lay out major Saudi VIP indictments
dealing with charity financing

299
00:22:01,753 --> 00:22:04,516
out of this Boston investment firm.
We're gonna freeze a lot of Saudi cash

300
00:22:04,588 --> 00:22:06,284
and roll out some
hardcore embarrassment.

301
00:22:06,358 --> 00:22:08,417
And you tell them
I'm heading up the investigation.

302
00:22:08,493 --> 00:22:10,051
And I'm not the nicest
kid on the block.

303
00:22:10,128 --> 00:22:11,117
That's accurate.

304
00:22:11,196 --> 00:22:12,857
And all I need is
15 minutes tonight.

305
00:22:12,931 --> 00:22:13,988
Tonight?

306
00:22:14,067 --> 00:22:15,260
Come on. Exclusive.

307
00:22:15,334 --> 00:22:17,359
I know you like exclusives.

308
00:22:18,637 --> 00:22:20,264
I'll see what I can do.

309
00:22:28,413 --> 00:22:31,006
Your Excellency,
Special Agent Ronald Fleury.

310
00:22:31,082 --> 00:22:33,642
Listen, can we talk inside?
Sure.

311
00:22:33,718 --> 00:22:35,846
There's too many people in there
that know both me and you.

312
00:22:35,921 --> 00:22:39,118
I would like to keep this
as discreet as possible.

313
00:22:40,325 --> 00:22:43,555
I know you have a busy schedule.
It's just, so many people in there.

314
00:22:43,628 --> 00:22:46,119
Why don't we
pull up here and talk?

315
00:22:47,866 --> 00:22:52,235
I had an interesting conversation
<i>with a reporter from the Post.</i>

316
00:22:52,304 --> 00:22:56,001
She exaggerates a lot of things.
Me, I consider myself a friend.

317
00:22:56,442 --> 00:22:57,737
A friend of Saudi Arabia.

318
00:22:57,808 --> 00:23:00,936
I just need a little cooperation,
that's all.

319
00:23:01,412 --> 00:23:02,812
What kind of cooperation?

320
00:23:02,881 --> 00:23:04,211
Like clearance to land

321
00:23:04,281 --> 00:23:06,408
on the Prince Sultan's
airport tomorrow.

322
00:23:06,484 --> 00:23:08,750
One month would be
as soon as we could.

323
00:23:09,154 --> 00:23:12,123
One month. This is gonna go
down one of two ways.

324
00:23:12,189 --> 00:23:15,159
One, the F. B. I. Has evidence that
two Royal Family wives donated

325
00:23:15,227 --> 00:23:17,991
$10 million to three
Arab-American cultural centers

326
00:23:18,063 --> 00:23:19,495
right outside of Boston,

327
00:23:19,563 --> 00:23:21,930
and that some of that money
got to Jakarta

328
00:23:22,001 --> 00:23:24,400
and these mosques, and they have
training camps right next to them.

329
00:23:24,469 --> 00:23:26,129
It's just weird to see
little kids playing

330
00:23:26,205 --> 00:23:29,298
and then not-so-little kids
playing with guns right next door.

331
00:23:29,374 --> 00:23:32,104
It's just odd.
Don't you think?

332
00:23:32,177 --> 00:23:33,407
You have no proof of this.

333
00:23:33,479 --> 00:23:35,537
How do you know?

334
00:23:38,449 --> 00:23:40,576
It's gonna be big.
It's gonna be a big story.

335
00:23:40,652 --> 00:23:43,051
I mean, it's not just gonna be
in the metro papers.

336
00:23:43,121 --> 00:23:46,249
<i>It's gonna be in the Omaha Herald,</i>
<i>places like the Terrell Tribune.</i>

337
00:23:46,323 --> 00:23:48,019
You, you ever been
to Terrell, Texas?

338
00:23:48,093 --> 00:23:49,822
Good chili.

339
00:23:49,895 --> 00:23:51,157
What is your point?

340
00:23:51,629 --> 00:23:53,097
I want in immediately.

341
00:23:54,331 --> 00:23:55,663
Define immediately.

342
00:23:55,734 --> 00:23:57,463
Right the fuck now immediately.

343
00:24:07,513 --> 00:24:10,072
So, what was
Fran Manner to her?

344
00:24:10,782 --> 00:24:12,215
He taught her how to shoot.

345
00:24:13,184 --> 00:24:15,244
She introduced him
to his wife.

346
00:24:15,453 --> 00:24:17,922
And he got her
into the Bureau.

347
00:24:18,423 --> 00:24:21,017
They celebrated her graduation
at the IHOP

348
00:24:21,092 --> 00:24:23,322
until some townie called
Janet something.

349
00:24:23,395 --> 00:24:26,125
I don't know,
something not very nice.

350
00:24:26,198 --> 00:24:29,291
So the townie didn't see Fran
coming out of the head,

351
00:24:29,366 --> 00:24:33,031
but he definitely felt
Fran's uppercut shatter his jaw.

352
00:24:33,103 --> 00:24:35,369
Really? And he didn't get
bounced for that?

353
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:38,135
No. No, Fleury took care of it.

354
00:24:38,208 --> 00:24:42,579
Yeah, I do know the post in Riyadh was part
of the deal Fleury cut to save Fran's career.

355
00:24:42,647 --> 00:24:46,276
Thank you. Janet, what did Fleury whisper
to you this morning?

356
00:24:51,288 --> 00:24:53,382
Grant's age is a liability.

357
00:24:56,061 --> 00:24:57,790
Hey.
Hello, sir.

358
00:24:57,863 --> 00:24:58,852
Thanks for volunteering.

359
00:24:58,931 --> 00:25:00,124
Yeah, actually I didn't.

360
00:25:00,197 --> 00:25:01,222
Well, thank you, anyway.

361
00:25:01,298 --> 00:25:03,358
We're going to Riyadh?
Is that right?

362
00:25:03,435 --> 00:25:05,096
State Department said yes?
Nope.

363
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:06,159
White House?

364
00:25:06,238 --> 00:25:07,728
Nope.

365
00:25:07,806 --> 00:25:10,604
We bringing security?
No.

366
00:25:10,674 --> 00:25:12,905
This is really gonna suck,
I think.

367
00:25:12,977 --> 00:25:15,105
All right, well
that's very questionable.

368
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:16,841
Dog giving birth.
'Whelp.'

369
00:25:16,915 --> 00:25:17,903
W-H-E-L-P-S? Whelps?

370
00:25:17,983 --> 00:25:19,109
Yeah.

371
00:25:19,184 --> 00:25:21,484
Bitch giving birth.
Whelp. Next word.

372
00:25:21,553 --> 00:25:23,349
A dog giving birth.

373
00:25:23,420 --> 00:25:24,444
Right on.

374
00:25:24,522 --> 00:25:25,580
Is that what you thought
it meant?

375
00:25:25,656 --> 00:25:27,090
I know what it means.

376
00:25:27,158 --> 00:25:28,181
That's why I played it.

377
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:30,557
And you didn't think it was
a hit and a scream.

378
00:25:30,628 --> 00:25:33,827
Like a 'welt' and a 'yelp'?

379
00:25:33,899 --> 00:25:35,059
Yeah.

380
00:25:35,767 --> 00:25:38,031
I don't have much here,
don't worry about it.

381
00:25:38,103 --> 00:25:40,503
Hey, what are four people
supposed to do

382
00:25:40,572 --> 00:25:42,004
over there in five days,
anyway?

383
00:25:42,073 --> 00:25:44,633
Aren't you the one that practically
demanded we go this morning?

384
00:25:44,708 --> 00:25:47,701
I didn't say 'I.'
I said 'F. B. I.'

385
00:25:47,779 --> 00:25:48,768
Let's go.

386
00:25:48,847 --> 00:25:49,871
I got it, I got it!

387
00:25:49,948 --> 00:25:51,209
Here it comes.

388
00:25:52,317 --> 00:25:53,477
False alarm.

389
00:25:55,387 --> 00:25:57,183
What's it like over there
on the ground?

390
00:25:57,254 --> 00:25:59,655
It's a bit like Mars.

391
00:25:59,792 --> 00:26:00,951
Mars?
Yeah.

392
00:26:01,026 --> 00:26:03,357
Sounds like
I didn't pack right.

393
00:26:04,029 --> 00:26:08,022
Well, I will be looked at with disdain
for pretty much the entire time

394
00:26:08,099 --> 00:26:10,659
we're on the ground.
Kind of like South Virginia.

395
00:26:10,734 --> 00:26:13,101
Hey. Go easy on my kin.

396
00:27:49,734 --> 00:27:53,000
Man, it feels like you got
a beast in there, Fleury.

397
00:27:54,439 --> 00:27:56,270
What is it?
You don't think I'm okay?

398
00:27:56,341 --> 00:27:59,571
I think you're not
entirely clear right now.

399
00:28:03,982 --> 00:28:07,281
Look, you want to go?
We go. I got you.

400
00:28:07,353 --> 00:28:09,582
But you got to check yourself.

401
00:28:10,387 --> 00:28:11,548
I'm checked.

402
00:28:12,923 --> 00:28:16,883
Okay. I'm just checking
that you're checked.

403
00:28:26,570 --> 00:28:30,200
You know, I got 15 ties
in my closet from Fran.

404
00:28:30,674 --> 00:28:33,235
Every Christmas,
he'd give me these ties.

405
00:28:33,311 --> 00:28:36,006
Fran sent you ties?
He sent me ties, too.

406
00:28:36,081 --> 00:28:37,877
At least 12, 13 of them.

407
00:28:37,948 --> 00:28:40,109
Some of the ugliest ties
I've ever seen in...

408
00:28:40,186 --> 00:28:42,152
Hey, good-looking ties.
What?

409
00:28:42,219 --> 00:28:45,678
Very colorful.
I go fishing with those ties.

410
00:28:45,757 --> 00:28:49,124
I'll take you shopping with me sometime.
I'll show you style.

411
00:28:49,194 --> 00:28:50,456
You'll show me style?

412
00:28:50,526 --> 00:28:51,927
You gotta get
your L. L. Bean on.

413
00:28:51,996 --> 00:28:54,965
You got to? You probably buy your car
batteries and your shirts in the same place.

414
00:28:56,835 --> 00:28:58,666
That's good. That's good.

415
00:30:02,534 --> 00:30:03,592
Colonel Al Ghazi.

416
00:30:03,668 --> 00:30:05,101
Special Agent Ronald Fleury.

417
00:30:05,170 --> 00:30:09,004
Special Agent Mayes. Special Agent Sykes.
Special Agent Leavitt.

418
00:30:09,107 --> 00:30:10,939
You have your vests?
Excuse me?

419
00:30:11,009 --> 00:30:13,239
Vests. You know, stop bullets.
The vests.

420
00:30:13,311 --> 00:30:14,403
Bullet-proof vests.

421
00:30:14,479 --> 00:30:16,470
Yeah, we, we brought them.
We're good, thanks.

422
00:30:16,548 --> 00:30:19,642
Good. I will ask for
your passports and weapons.

423
00:30:28,359 --> 00:30:29,348
Sykes.

424
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:32,819
What?

425
00:30:35,866 --> 00:30:36,856
Fuck.

426
00:30:40,637 --> 00:30:42,698
There is an Israeli stamp in here.
Is that a problem?

427
00:30:44,042 --> 00:30:45,770
I've been to Israel
three times.

428
00:30:45,845 --> 00:30:47,573
Got a grandma there.
Is that all right?

429
00:30:49,013 --> 00:30:50,105
It's okay.

430
00:30:59,657 --> 00:31:03,184
I'm very sorry for your loss.
Your two fallen comrades.

431
00:31:09,902 --> 00:31:12,391
If you please go
to the second vehicle.

432
00:31:29,354 --> 00:31:30,980
It's like 150 miles an hour.

433
00:31:31,054 --> 00:31:32,317
You, like, doing
like a breathing thing?

434
00:31:32,390 --> 00:31:33,448
Like a yoga technique
or something?

435
00:31:33,524 --> 00:31:35,047
Do you have a problem with this?
Take the iPod.

436
00:31:35,125 --> 00:31:37,060
Yeah, I have a problem.
I wish that I was as calm as you are.

437
00:31:37,127 --> 00:31:39,027
I like it.
If somebody was tailing us,

438
00:31:39,097 --> 00:31:40,256
they'd stick out.

439
00:31:40,931 --> 00:31:43,229
Standard operation speed.

440
00:31:46,237 --> 00:31:48,467
Hey, explain to the driver
I get carsick.

441
00:31:48,539 --> 00:31:49,939
You've got to shut up.

442
00:31:50,008 --> 00:31:51,908
You ever been
to the U. S. , Colonel?

443
00:31:51,976 --> 00:31:54,001
Yeah, I have been there once.

444
00:31:54,711 --> 00:31:56,943
I spent four days in Quantico.

445
00:31:57,548 --> 00:32:01,711
I also saw Michael Jordan play
for the Washington Wizards.

446
00:32:01,819 --> 00:32:04,310
Hey, Colonel, your people got
portable lights on the scene?

447
00:32:04,389 --> 00:32:05,413
Portable lights?

448
00:32:05,490 --> 00:32:06,684
So we can
work at night.

449
00:32:06,758 --> 00:32:07,850
See what we're doing.
Lights, yes.

450
00:32:07,926 --> 00:32:10,952
We have portable lights.
But your team cannot work at night.

451
00:32:11,029 --> 00:32:13,623
Why? We only got seven days.
We work around the clock.

452
00:32:13,698 --> 00:32:17,189
Five, Mister. You have five days,
and you're not safe at night.

453
00:32:17,267 --> 00:32:18,494
We're safe
during the day, huh?

454
00:32:18,568 --> 00:32:22,300
Listen, were the uniformed bombers
brother soldiers?

455
00:32:22,373 --> 00:32:23,931
I don't know.

456
00:32:24,008 --> 00:32:27,273
Driver, are we late or something?
Is there a...

457
00:32:27,345 --> 00:32:28,812
Abu Hamza.

458
00:32:31,316 --> 00:32:34,581
You think he was responsible
for these attacks?

459
00:32:38,556 --> 00:32:39,545
I don't know.

460
00:32:39,624 --> 00:32:40,784
You don't know
the source of the blast.

461
00:32:40,858 --> 00:32:42,883
You don't know
if there was uniformed officers.

462
00:32:42,961 --> 00:32:45,657
Listen, Mister,
Special Agent Fleury.

463
00:32:45,763 --> 00:32:48,528
Forty-seven of my men were
blown into hundreds of pieces.

464
00:32:48,599 --> 00:32:50,191
That will take months
to collect them.

465
00:32:50,267 --> 00:32:53,237
Eighty thousands of officers
across all the country.

466
00:32:53,304 --> 00:32:56,330
Thousands of people
that can forge identity.

467
00:32:56,407 --> 00:33:00,309
I apologize. I'm very sorry
I don't have definitive answers.

468
00:33:03,414 --> 00:33:05,609
Hey, driver, driver, driver!

469
00:33:12,423 --> 00:33:13,481
It's a camel.

470
00:33:13,558 --> 00:33:15,390
That's, well,
it's good practice, huh?

471
00:33:15,461 --> 00:33:18,293
Maybe slower,
next time we'll recognize livestock.

472
00:33:55,833 --> 00:33:59,360
Okay. The bathroom
through that door.

473
00:34:00,436 --> 00:34:03,875
We tried to give you
some privacy.

474
00:34:04,475 --> 00:34:07,569
Actually, I want to put you
in the bathroom,

475
00:34:07,645 --> 00:34:10,808
but if it's okay
with you this. So...

476
00:34:11,582 --> 00:34:13,641
And we try to find
something pink

477
00:34:13,717 --> 00:34:16,186
but I wish it will
make the job.

478
00:34:16,254 --> 00:34:19,087
Okay, tomorrow we will
start working.

479
00:34:19,158 --> 00:34:20,851
I will come in the morning.

480
00:34:21,559 --> 00:34:23,025
See you tomorrow.

481
00:34:23,093 --> 00:34:24,254
Al Ghazi.
Yeah?

482
00:34:24,327 --> 00:34:26,319
Exactly what time are you
coming tomorrow?

483
00:34:26,397 --> 00:34:28,023
Sunrise.
Okay.

484
00:34:28,098 --> 00:34:29,464
What time is sunrise?

485
00:34:29,734 --> 00:34:31,668
Excuse me!
What time is sunrise?

486
00:34:31,969 --> 00:34:34,096
When I open this door.
Good night.

487
00:34:38,009 --> 00:34:39,739
That's against fire code.

488
00:34:40,278 --> 00:34:42,507
They don't have
fire codes here, Sykes.

489
00:34:42,579 --> 00:34:44,571
You're in the jungle now, baby.
Look sharp.

490
00:34:44,648 --> 00:34:48,278
Axl, do you have any more lollipops?
Blood sugar's a little low.

491
00:34:49,253 --> 00:34:52,483
Don't cross this pink line.
Stay back.

492
00:34:52,556 --> 00:34:54,718
You're real butch
after a long flight.

493
00:34:54,791 --> 00:34:57,158
<i>'Contrary to</i>
<i>the State Department policy,</i>

494
00:34:57,229 --> 00:34:59,093

<i>I have come before this committee</i>

That's you, baby.

I mean the fucking
Senate Select Committee on Terror.

504
00:35:37,068 --> 00:35:39,764
So you're going before
the Senate Select Committee

505
00:35:39,837 --> 00:35:41,997
and not to the President
who appointed you.

506
00:35:42,072 --> 00:35:43,507
Why is that?

507
00:35:43,841 --> 00:35:46,537
I bet the President wasn't
the audience you thought he'd be.

508
00:35:46,778 --> 00:35:49,370
I'll bet the President realized
that you can't have voters asking

509
00:35:49,446 --> 00:35:53,440
why the second longest-serving
F. B. I. Director got fired for doing his job.

510
00:35:53,518 --> 00:35:57,819
For sending agents to Saudi Arabia just
seven months before mid-term elections.

511
00:35:57,889 --> 00:35:59,549
So you want to bet?

512
00:35:59,623 --> 00:36:02,491
Mister Attorney General,
I obviously already have.

513
00:36:02,726 --> 00:36:03,716
I bet my job.

514
00:36:04,728 --> 00:36:06,025
I'm gonna bury you.

515
00:36:06,095 --> 00:36:11,433
You know, Westmoreland made all of us
officers write our own obituaries during Tet.

516
00:36:11,736 --> 00:36:14,864
When we thought the Cong were
gonna end it all right there.

517
00:36:14,939 --> 00:36:17,840
And once we clued in
to the fact that life is finite,

518
00:36:17,975 --> 00:36:21,240
the thought of losing it
didn't scare us anymore.

519
00:36:22,212 --> 00:36:23,841
The end comes no matter what.

520
00:36:23,916 --> 00:36:26,711
The only thing that matters is
how do you want to go out?

521
00:36:26,784 --> 00:36:28,719
On your feet or on your knees?

522
00:36:29,921 --> 00:36:31,947
I bring that lesson to this job.

523
00:36:33,724 --> 00:36:37,820
I act knowing that someday
this job will end, no matter what.

524
00:36:40,731 --> 00:36:42,665
You should do the same.

525
00:37:44,661 --> 00:37:46,789
Which one of you
is Ronald Fleury?

526
00:37:49,667 --> 00:37:50,998
Damon Schmidt,
State Department.

527
00:37:51,069 --> 00:37:53,969
I'm here to make sure
that you get out of here okay.

528
00:37:54,705 --> 00:37:56,570
Is this your team right here?
Yes. All three of them.

529
00:37:56,642 --> 00:37:59,610
Hey, everybody, you're gonna need these.
Electrolytes.

530
00:37:59,677 --> 00:38:02,405
Good to see you.
Some electrolytes for you.

531
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:05,044
Take that.
You don't want to drop in this heat.

532
00:38:05,115 --> 00:38:07,413
Do you have any idea
how much trouble you're in?

533
00:38:07,484 --> 00:38:09,476
My boss hates you.

534
00:38:09,552 --> 00:38:10,679
He's furious.

535
00:38:10,754 --> 00:38:12,279
When you get back home,
you're done.

536
00:38:12,523 --> 00:38:15,651
If you make it back home.
Now here comes the Prince.

537
00:38:15,727 --> 00:38:19,253
You hold onto his hand and you make sure
you don't let go of it until he does, okay?

538
00:38:20,031 --> 00:38:22,760
That's good.
We got to dial down the boobies.

539
00:38:22,866 --> 00:38:24,993
We need to cover
these situations.

540
00:38:25,236 --> 00:38:27,134
No verbal response.

541
00:38:27,205 --> 00:38:28,999
All right, everybody,
here we go.

542
00:38:29,071 --> 00:38:31,837
Your Excellency,
Special Agent Fleury

543
00:38:31,909 --> 00:38:34,968
of the Federal Bureau of Investigation
and his colleagues.

544
00:38:54,865 --> 00:38:58,028
You will honor me with
your presence tomorrow at my home.

545
00:39:05,709 --> 00:39:08,702
I'll tell you why this is a win.
You documented it and you're still alive.

546
00:39:08,779 --> 00:39:10,644
I got a plane.
It's fueled up,

547
00:39:10,715 --> 00:39:12,306
it's ready to go,
it's got your name on it.

548
00:39:12,382 --> 00:39:14,111
You guys want to go,
let's do it.

549
00:39:14,184 --> 00:39:16,813
You talk a lot.
A little too much.

550
00:39:18,554 --> 00:39:20,023
You wearing a vest?

551
00:39:20,091 --> 00:39:22,615
You got nothing.
You got nothing, big boy.

552
00:39:22,693 --> 00:39:26,322
You want to tighten up the Kevlar. Okay?
All right. Offer still stands.

553
00:39:26,397 --> 00:39:27,385
I'm always ready to go.

554
00:39:38,709 --> 00:39:40,177
So what'd the Prince say?

555
00:39:40,242 --> 00:39:43,008
That there are more rules
than just not working at night.

556
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:44,171
Rules? What rules?

557
00:39:44,248 --> 00:39:45,909
It's a slow roll.

558
00:39:47,151 --> 00:39:49,642
This whole trip's gonna be
like deep sea fishing in Florida.

559
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:52,483
We need more security here
before we go on.

560
00:39:52,556 --> 00:39:54,489
Are you fucking kidding me?
You got a fucking army.

561
00:39:54,558 --> 00:39:58,323
I'm not kidding you, okay?
And don't talk to me with this language.

562
00:39:58,395 --> 00:40:01,923
You pay 700 bucks for a boat,
sit on your can out in the ocean.

563
00:40:01,999 --> 00:40:06,561
Crew jumps around, screams, points,
throws out fish bait, you catch nothing.

564
00:40:06,703 --> 00:40:08,797
Okay, let's go
inside now, please.

565
00:40:25,289 --> 00:40:28,155
This is the kind of
radical circumstance

566
00:40:28,225 --> 00:40:31,352
that could have seriously upped
Shaq's free throw percentages.

567
00:40:31,428 --> 00:40:32,953
I mean, you take a man,
you ship him off to Riyadh.

568
00:40:33,030 --> 00:40:34,998
Grant.
No cell phones,

569
00:40:35,065 --> 00:40:36,396
Look at this website.

570
00:40:36,467 --> 00:40:38,765
Nothing but being
locked in a gym.

571
00:40:39,003 --> 00:40:42,268
He could have been shooting,
what, 70, 80 percent?

572
00:40:42,605 --> 00:40:46,508
Lakers would still be together.
Kobe and Shaq, lovers forever.

573
00:40:47,410 --> 00:40:49,709
I don't know about that part.
Kobe's a hater.

574
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:51,805
Fleury, come here
and look at this.

575
00:40:52,182 --> 00:40:54,174
It's a website that went up
about a half hour ago,

576
00:40:54,251 --> 00:40:57,014
Al Saha dot something.

577
00:40:58,323 --> 00:41:01,188
They so love
to flaunt their work.

578
00:41:06,798 --> 00:41:08,696
Time to go.

579
00:41:11,835 --> 00:41:15,704
You won't need your gear.
Not yet.

580
00:41:15,938 --> 00:41:17,532
That's what I thought.

581
00:41:17,808 --> 00:41:19,638
The remaining rules.

582
00:41:19,943 --> 00:41:23,071
You cannot touch evidence,
please leave it.

583
00:41:23,146 --> 00:41:25,774
You cannot question
anyone without me present,

584
00:41:25,883 --> 00:41:29,215
touch a dead Muslim,
or leave my sight at any time.

585
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:32,550
Your safety is
my primary concern.

586
00:41:32,857 --> 00:41:35,222
I thought your primary concern
would be the investigation.

587
00:41:35,291 --> 00:41:37,021
And you would be mistaken.

588
00:41:37,995 --> 00:41:39,688
I think this is one of those
'something happens to us,

589
00:41:39,763 --> 00:41:41,458
'his head comes off'
kind of deals.

590
00:41:41,530 --> 00:41:42,761
You're our babysitter, right?

591
00:41:42,834 --> 00:41:44,664
We call that a babysitter.

592
00:41:44,735 --> 00:41:46,864
Yeah. Who's running
the investigation?

593
00:41:46,936 --> 00:41:48,370
General Abdulmalik.

594
00:41:48,439 --> 00:41:50,872
He has given us permission to
walk through the crime scene.

595
00:41:50,940 --> 00:41:51,965
Walk through? Shit.
Walk through?

596
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:53,030
You kidding me?

597
00:41:53,111 --> 00:41:54,974
Where are you going,
Mr. Fleury?

598
00:41:55,044 --> 00:41:56,740
I'm gonna go find somebody
that's in charge, so I can get

599
00:41:56,814 --> 00:41:58,213
some clarification
on what's going on.

600
00:41:58,281 --> 00:41:59,647
Okay, there is
nothing to clarify.

601
00:41:59,717 --> 00:42:01,911
Yes, the hell there is!
You think I flew over here for 18 hours,

602
00:42:01,985 --> 00:42:03,476
and you gonna tell us
we can walk through?

603
00:42:03,554 --> 00:42:05,419
I don't know what kind of game you playing.
I'm not that guy!

604
00:42:05,490 --> 00:42:08,614
Listen. This is not
a game show, Mr. Fleury.

605
00:42:08,792 --> 00:42:11,351
And definitely there are
no deals made here.

606
00:42:11,562 --> 00:42:14,224
There is me telling you
what you may or may not do.

607
00:42:14,298 --> 00:42:15,491
And there is you doing it.
That's it.

608
00:42:15,565 --> 00:42:17,794
You gonna tell me what to do.

609
00:42:17,866 --> 00:42:19,834
You will be permitted to
walk through the crime scene

610
00:42:19,905 --> 00:42:22,532
when we determine it is safe,
that's it.

611
00:42:23,073 --> 00:42:24,301
Any questions?

612
00:42:27,044 --> 00:42:29,239
By the way,
I don't like your jokes.

613
00:42:32,583 --> 00:42:34,380
What about witnesses?

614
00:42:37,054 --> 00:42:39,418
The witnesses?

615
00:42:39,490 --> 00:42:41,754
So you haven't interviewed
the witnesses?

616
00:42:42,393 --> 00:42:43,449
Not yet.

617
00:42:43,529 --> 00:42:44,755
Can we do that?

618
00:43:02,845 --> 00:43:04,438
We didn't really see anything.

619
00:43:05,014 --> 00:43:07,915
It was so fast and so loud.

620
00:43:08,719 --> 00:43:10,414
So nobody saw anything?

621
00:43:10,487 --> 00:43:13,650
I hit the deck.
The place was going Rambo.

622
00:43:13,724 --> 00:43:15,314
Guns, guns, guns.

623
00:43:15,392 --> 00:43:17,019
We went into our safe room.

624
00:43:17,094 --> 00:43:18,925
Safe room, what's that?
That room right there.

625
00:43:20,097 --> 00:43:24,193
Earl got an allowance of about $15,000
when we moved here to build it.

626
00:43:26,103 --> 00:43:29,971
We stayed in here,
till we heard the screams.

627
00:43:30,541 --> 00:43:32,441
Yeah, those kids were screaming,
all right.

628
00:43:33,110 --> 00:43:35,009
That's what got me out
of the house. Them kids.

629
00:43:35,145 --> 00:43:36,271
Which kids are those?

630
00:43:37,281 --> 00:43:40,250
Tracy Jackson.
She lived next door.

631
00:43:42,118 --> 00:43:46,077
She was murdered looking out
of her own window, in front of her children.

632
00:43:46,189 --> 00:43:48,488
Jacksons didn't have
a safe room.

633
00:43:58,067 --> 00:43:59,592
Mr. Jackson?

634
00:44:03,806 --> 00:44:07,038
Mr. Jackson. Aaron Jackson?

635
00:44:07,111 --> 00:44:08,135
Yeah.

636
00:44:09,845 --> 00:44:11,405
You keep him away from me!

637
00:44:11,482 --> 00:44:12,846
Hold on, hold on.

638
00:44:13,016 --> 00:44:15,041
Special Agent
F. B. I. Ronald Fleury.

639
00:44:15,283 --> 00:44:16,479
You know what?

640
00:44:16,553 --> 00:44:18,248
That's... Whoa, whoa.

641
00:44:18,589 --> 00:44:20,250
They're the ones
that attacked us.

642
00:44:20,322 --> 00:44:21,722
We don't know that just yet.

643
00:44:21,792 --> 00:44:23,156
That's what I'm here for.

644
00:44:23,226 --> 00:44:25,991
I just need to ask the boys
some questions about maybe something

645
00:44:26,063 --> 00:44:27,290
that they saw the other night.

646
00:44:27,363 --> 00:44:29,161
What do you want to ask my boys
about the other night?

647
00:44:29,233 --> 00:44:31,029
I told you...

648
00:44:31,100 --> 00:44:32,159
What do you want
to ask them about?

649
00:44:32,236 --> 00:44:34,396
You want to ask them about
watching their mother bleed to death?

650
00:44:34,470 --> 00:44:36,871
Is that what you want
to ask my boys?

651
00:44:37,707 --> 00:44:41,007
My 5-year-old boy,
when I got home, had a box of Band-Aids

652
00:44:41,512 --> 00:44:44,345
and he was trying to put
his mama's mouth back on.

653
00:44:49,886 --> 00:44:51,979
Is this what Mohammed
the prophet...

654
00:44:52,054 --> 00:44:53,318
Oh, come on, man,
let's not have a fight.

655
00:44:53,390 --> 00:44:55,152
Is this what Allah wants?
You know that, this isn't...

656
00:44:55,224 --> 00:44:56,452
This isn't gonna bring
your wife back.

657
00:44:56,527 --> 00:44:58,825
Does Allah love your kids
more than he does mine?

658
00:44:58,896 --> 00:45:01,694
Does Allah love your wife
more than he does mine?

659
00:45:02,165 --> 00:45:04,258
Leave me the fuck alone
and do not come back to my house!

660
00:45:04,333 --> 00:45:05,891
I'll leave you alone,
but just...

661
00:45:05,969 --> 00:45:07,664
I should have went home
a long goddamn time ago!

662
00:45:18,681 --> 00:45:20,377
This is the big explosion.

663
00:45:21,385 --> 00:45:24,911
About one hour
into the rescue.

664
00:45:48,145 --> 00:45:49,510
Where did
the water come from?

665
00:45:49,579 --> 00:45:51,047
They hit a water main?

666
00:45:51,114 --> 00:45:52,102
Water main?

667
00:45:52,182 --> 00:45:53,342
Yeah, where'd the water
come from?

668
00:45:53,417 --> 00:45:55,010
From a water pipe?
They break one?

669
00:45:55,084 --> 00:46:00,647
No, it's from the tanks
of this fire engine.

670
00:46:00,857 --> 00:46:05,055
This is the water that didn't,
how you say it, evaporate in the blast.

671
00:46:05,128 --> 00:46:06,959
This truck used to be here?

672
00:46:07,029 --> 00:46:09,394
We think so.

673
00:46:09,566 --> 00:46:14,161
This hole is the case.
Your men are contaminating this.

674
00:46:14,938 --> 00:46:18,465
You understand evidence?
Little things that are clues.

675
00:46:18,643 --> 00:46:22,169
Clues can be very helpful
to a fellow trying to solve a crime.

676
00:46:22,980 --> 00:46:24,470
You want to go into the hole?

677
00:46:24,548 --> 00:46:25,775
Yeah! Absolutely.

678
00:46:26,083 --> 00:46:28,176
No.

679
00:46:28,252 --> 00:46:29,684
All right.

680
00:46:32,555 --> 00:46:34,148
Who was running security?

681
00:46:34,224 --> 00:46:37,317
Security here is
a combination of police

682
00:46:37,393 --> 00:46:39,793
and National Guards of...

683
00:46:42,231 --> 00:46:45,689
Mr. Sykes! Please come back.

684
00:46:54,610 --> 00:46:55,600
Please.

685
00:47:06,089 --> 00:47:07,783
This vehicle was stolen.

686
00:47:08,491 --> 00:47:12,018
A team outside the blast radius,
shooting at anything, everyone.

687
00:47:12,695 --> 00:47:14,789
Sergeant Haytham ended this part.

688
00:47:23,438 --> 00:47:25,772
Were any of the shooters your men?
Real Saudi police?

689
00:47:25,843 --> 00:47:27,207
No, they weren't.

690
00:47:35,551 --> 00:47:36,643
Nice work.

691
00:47:38,754 --> 00:47:42,452
There were two officers in the car.
Both of them were executed.

692
00:47:46,429 --> 00:47:49,866
And those were your men.
I'm sorry.

693
00:47:54,003 --> 00:47:55,096
Car was parked here,
backed in?

694
00:47:55,172 --> 00:47:56,263
Yes.

695
00:47:56,538 --> 00:47:57,528
They were attacked
from the front,

696
00:47:57,608 --> 00:47:59,575
so they must have assumed
they were fellow officers.

697
00:47:59,644 --> 00:48:00,735
These guys been
identified yet?

698
00:48:00,811 --> 00:48:04,247
Not yet. It's likely that the four men
prayed in the same mosque.

699
00:48:04,313 --> 00:48:05,802
That's enough to identify them?

700
00:48:05,883 --> 00:48:06,940
If it's in Suweidi, yes.

701
00:48:07,017 --> 00:48:08,041
Suweidi?

702
00:48:08,117 --> 00:48:10,018
Suweidi's a known
militant stronghold.

703
00:48:10,087 --> 00:48:11,748
Al Qaeda could recruit
from the storefronts.

704
00:48:11,821 --> 00:48:13,812
Is there any way we can check out
those surrounding buildings.

705
00:48:13,890 --> 00:48:15,619
Like especially
that one right there.

706
00:48:15,691 --> 00:48:17,284
Why?
From the posting

707
00:48:17,361 --> 00:48:19,419
the attack was filmed
from a high vantage point

708
00:48:19,495 --> 00:48:22,260
and that building right there
looks over the whole crime scene.

709
00:48:22,333 --> 00:48:23,798
It's outside the walls.

710
00:48:23,866 --> 00:48:25,163
Come on now,
this is damn insane.

711
00:48:25,235 --> 00:48:27,635
We got enough security to
invade North Korea and Suweidi...

712
00:48:27,704 --> 00:48:29,604
You don't know
what you are talking about.

713
00:48:29,672 --> 00:48:31,071
Can we just ask?

714
00:48:34,043 --> 00:48:35,101
Okay.

715
00:48:35,177 --> 00:48:37,408
All right. We'll be
in the Community Center.

716
00:48:55,465 --> 00:49:01,130
How many virgins
will be available to you upon entry

717
00:49:01,203 --> 00:49:07,802
into the afterlife here, if you follow
what the zealots follow in this stuff?

718
00:49:08,177 --> 00:49:09,405
Seventy.

719
00:49:10,747 --> 00:49:12,077
That's incorrect.

720
00:50:37,134 --> 00:50:38,862
Hey, buddy,
how you doing?

721
00:50:39,235 --> 00:50:40,669
I'm in Saudi Arabia.

722
00:50:40,736 --> 00:50:42,636
Yeah, you remember
where I showed you on the map?

723
00:50:44,607 --> 00:50:47,633
Well, right now I'm sitting
in the gym-slash-hotel.

724
00:50:50,379 --> 00:50:54,874
What? Yeah, Fran is,
Fran's around.

725
00:50:54,951 --> 00:50:58,749
We, we... Yeah, I saw him.

726
00:51:00,623 --> 00:51:03,091
He is...
He's, he's tall as ever.

727
00:51:05,062 --> 00:51:07,757
Yeah, and
we're looking for the bad guy.

728
00:51:08,464 --> 00:51:11,592
And I'm gonna get some sleep.
Yeah, I'm gonna go to bed.

729
00:51:12,001 --> 00:51:13,992
I love you, too.
All right, bye.

730
00:51:37,895 --> 00:51:39,224
We have permission.

731
00:51:39,495 --> 00:51:40,485
Really?

732
00:51:40,563 --> 00:51:41,588
Yeah.

733
00:52:24,607 --> 00:52:27,303
There's the building.
That's the rooftop.

734
00:52:33,282 --> 00:52:34,271
We have a problem.

735
00:52:34,351 --> 00:52:35,682
What's the problem?

736
00:53:01,177 --> 00:53:02,509
Hey! Hey! Hey!

737
00:53:02,578 --> 00:53:06,105
All right, easy, easy, easy.
Fleury, stop Fleury. Careful. Leave it!

738
00:53:11,520 --> 00:53:13,216
Fuck!
Al Ghazi!

739
00:53:14,423 --> 00:53:15,822
Tell me he didn't
blow out my eardrum.

740
00:53:15,892 --> 00:53:16,880
Is it fucking bleeding?

741
00:53:16,959 --> 00:53:18,324
It's all right.
There's no blood.

742
00:53:23,399 --> 00:53:27,233
Come on, you okay? Let's get up.
Janet, you okay? Let's get up.

743
00:53:34,477 --> 00:53:35,841
Are you okay?
Come on, Janet.

744
00:53:35,911 --> 00:53:37,606
Are you okay?
No, are you okay?

745
00:53:37,680 --> 00:53:38,738
I'm good. I'm good. Thanks.

746
00:53:38,814 --> 00:53:39,940
You sure? Let me look at you.

747
00:53:40,015 --> 00:53:41,004
Okay. Thank you.

748
00:53:41,083 --> 00:53:42,607
All right.
Come on, let's go up.

749
00:53:52,028 --> 00:53:53,517
Fleury, look at this.

750
00:53:53,595 --> 00:53:56,999
There's the front gate,
the police car and the bomb site.

751
00:53:57,066 --> 00:53:59,660
And look.
That's about the same angle, right?

752
00:54:00,369 --> 00:54:04,136
Yeah. Al Ghazi, have you seen
the video on Al Saha?

753
00:54:04,305 --> 00:54:07,241
Look. Look right through there.
Same exact thing.

754
00:54:07,810 --> 00:54:10,371
This is too pretty of a plan
to be hatched in just one day.

755
00:54:10,446 --> 00:54:12,744
He had to come here
a couple of times.

756
00:54:13,282 --> 00:54:15,045
This man is a Saudi.

757
00:54:16,018 --> 00:54:18,282
See, if foreigners were here,

758
00:54:18,621 --> 00:54:20,487
someone would say something.

759
00:54:20,557 --> 00:54:22,889
So maybe Abu Hamza?
Could be.

760
00:54:22,959 --> 00:54:24,823
Yeah. Then we should ask around.
Get out of here and some people...

761
00:54:24,894 --> 00:54:26,485
They won't tell you anything.

762
00:54:26,562 --> 00:54:27,653
Why not?

763
00:54:27,729 --> 00:54:29,254
He's like Robin Hood to you.

764
00:54:30,599 --> 00:54:32,294
People feel
sympathy to him.

765
00:54:32,368 --> 00:54:33,767
Well, we know two things.

766
00:54:33,836 --> 00:54:35,895
We know he was Saudi,
we know he was here.

767
00:54:35,971 --> 00:54:37,495
That's two big answers
in two minutes.

768
00:54:37,573 --> 00:54:39,199
Imagine if we had
a couple of days.

769
00:54:39,275 --> 00:54:41,267
General Malik, he's got
his heart in the right place,

770
00:54:41,344 --> 00:54:43,811
but he is clearly
not an investigator.

771
00:54:43,879 --> 00:54:46,312
Now listen.
Let me help you.

772
00:54:48,651 --> 00:54:50,118
AL GHAZl:
It's a detonator. Where you...

773
00:54:50,185 --> 00:54:51,582
Yeah, it's a gift
from us to you.

774
00:54:51,655 --> 00:54:54,316
We found it at the bomb site.
Run with that.

775
00:54:56,425 --> 00:54:57,687
Leavitt!
Yeah?

776
00:54:59,061 --> 00:55:00,494
Hey, where,
where are you going?

777
00:55:00,562 --> 00:55:02,758
You got a lot of evidence here.
We'd like to bag it.

778
00:55:02,832 --> 00:55:04,094
No, no we have five minutes...

779
00:55:04,166 --> 00:55:06,101
Fucking bullshit.
We're here to collect evidence.

780
00:55:06,168 --> 00:55:07,465
Why you say this bad word?

781
00:55:07,536 --> 00:55:09,027
We're not fucking
tourists here, all right.

782
00:55:09,104 --> 00:55:10,197
Why you say these bad words?

783
00:55:10,273 --> 00:55:11,739
I'm getting the kit.
Fleury, talk to this guy.

784
00:55:11,807 --> 00:55:14,833
I would bring a soap
and wash your mouth!

785
00:55:17,380 --> 00:55:18,437
Leavitt!

786
00:55:18,514 --> 00:55:20,482
Yeah, it's Leavitt,
not Livette.

787
00:55:20,550 --> 00:55:23,040
I'm not a goddamn
French-Canadian.

788
00:55:25,054 --> 00:55:28,990
Tonight we have the dinner
in the palace.

789
00:55:30,259 --> 00:55:33,922
Miss Mayes,
she can't be there.

790
00:55:34,463 --> 00:55:36,454
It's only men.
Only men?

791
00:55:36,532 --> 00:55:38,057
Yeah, you know, tradition.

792
00:55:38,134 --> 00:55:39,896
That's gonna be boring.
No women?

793
00:55:40,002 --> 00:55:41,127
No. Just men.

794
00:55:41,203 --> 00:55:42,465
No women allowed. All right.

795
00:55:42,538 --> 00:55:43,903
Only men.
Yeah.

796
00:55:43,970 --> 00:55:45,337
You wait.
No.

797
00:55:45,408 --> 00:55:48,274
Janet. He wants to
tell you something.

798
00:55:52,648 --> 00:55:53,909
What?

799
00:55:53,981 --> 00:55:55,609
How's your ear? It is good?

800
00:55:56,486 --> 00:55:58,680
It's the right one
or the left?

801
00:57:20,369 --> 00:57:21,495
How many princes are there?

802
00:57:21,570 --> 00:57:22,799
Over 5,000.

803
00:57:22,871 --> 00:57:24,463
Does every prince get
a palace this big?

804
00:57:24,540 --> 00:57:25,939
Some get bigger.

805
00:57:26,008 --> 00:57:27,441
And who pays
for all this?

806
00:57:27,509 --> 00:57:29,773
Exxon? Chevron? Shell?

807
00:57:29,845 --> 00:57:33,679
Serious now, the Prince will
talk to you like subjects.

808
00:57:33,749 --> 00:57:36,742
If he gives you to hold
his raptor, do not flinch.

809
00:57:36,819 --> 00:57:38,116
It is a compliment.

810
00:57:38,186 --> 00:57:39,950
His what?
Hold his rapture?

811
00:57:43,626 --> 00:57:45,252
His talons slice bones.

812
00:57:45,995 --> 00:57:47,120
That right?

813
00:57:48,063 --> 00:57:50,054
That's my most prolific hunter.

814
00:57:50,832 --> 00:57:52,858
I try to teach his friend
over there,

815
00:57:52,935 --> 00:57:55,495
but I fear it is something
you are born with or not.

816
00:57:56,138 --> 00:57:57,696
You agree,
Mr. Ronald?

817
00:57:57,773 --> 00:57:59,071
Innate or not at all?

818
00:57:59,141 --> 00:58:00,200
I do.

819
00:58:01,108 --> 00:58:02,906
What have you seen
so far in our kingdom?

820
00:58:02,979 --> 00:58:06,436
I know that I can arrange a safari for you
and your colleagues.

821
00:58:07,783 --> 00:58:08,875
Safari?

822
00:58:11,553 --> 00:58:12,679
Well...

823
00:58:21,230 --> 00:58:23,595
I'll tell you what I've seen.
I've seen...

824
00:58:27,836 --> 00:58:31,204
I've seen that the man that planned
the worst crime in your kingdom's history

825
00:58:31,273 --> 00:58:33,673
is without a doubt Saudi.

826
00:58:38,847 --> 00:58:41,748
If you walk three kilometers
from the compound,

827
00:58:42,149 --> 00:58:45,313
you will find the rooftop
where the attacks were planned.

828
00:58:45,621 --> 00:58:48,715
I've seen a person in this room
who's 'born with it.'

829
00:58:48,924 --> 00:58:53,656
Colonel Al Ghazi. Everything that
I'm telling you Mr. Al Ghazi told us

830
00:58:53,795 --> 00:58:56,730
while he was observing the crime scenes
and protecting us.

831
00:58:56,798 --> 00:58:58,288
He wasn't even on duty.

832
00:58:58,367 --> 00:59:01,393
So I agree with you that instincts
like this cannot be taught.

833
00:59:01,470 --> 00:59:04,633
Not to falcons,
and definitely not to SANG generals.

834
00:59:05,141 --> 00:59:08,632
I know you want him caught.
We want him caught.

835
00:59:08,744 --> 00:59:10,735
So let us help you.

836
00:59:10,811 --> 00:59:14,111
America's not perfect, not at all,
I'll be the first to say that,

837
00:59:14,182 --> 00:59:16,242
but we are good at this.

838
00:59:16,319 --> 00:59:21,120
Allow us to help your men
go catch this criminal.

839
00:59:33,402 --> 00:59:35,371
The rules
for tonight still stand,

840
00:59:35,437 --> 00:59:36,734
but tomorrow is a new day.

841
00:59:36,805 --> 00:59:37,829
All right, Ghazi.

842
00:59:37,905 --> 00:59:38,999
Look at you Mr. Al Ghazi.

843
00:59:39,075 --> 00:59:40,872
Coming through.
You feeling your power, huh?

844
00:59:40,943 --> 00:59:42,706
Yeah, of course.
You feel his power?

845
00:59:42,778 --> 00:59:44,837
We made a success
tonight, correct or not?

846
00:59:44,913 --> 00:59:45,902
We need to party.

847
00:59:46,014 --> 00:59:47,003
Okay.

848
01:00:06,134 --> 01:00:07,624
Okay. Give him half,
you keep half.

849
01:00:07,704 --> 01:00:09,068
Tell him pass them out
around the compound,

850
01:00:09,137 --> 01:00:11,128
see if they recognize anything.

851
01:00:13,508 --> 01:00:14,701
Let's go.

852
01:00:30,560 --> 01:00:32,891
Need a little check? Huh?

853
01:00:32,995 --> 01:00:35,965
You big queer.
I can... Never mind.

854
01:00:38,166 --> 01:00:40,634
Gonna have to get
a little dirty, people.

855
01:00:41,370 --> 01:00:44,203
Yeah, you got to get dirty.
Nasty, filthy!

856
01:00:47,209 --> 01:00:51,373
All right, fellows, what we need to do is
get this water out of here.

857
01:00:51,647 --> 01:00:54,445
So we can see what's
really going on down here.

858
01:00:55,751 --> 01:00:57,049
You understand?

859
01:00:59,222 --> 01:01:02,384
See, something drivable
blew up.

860
01:01:09,931 --> 01:01:13,527
Let's dry up this hole to see
if we can't figure out what she was.

861
01:01:14,302 --> 01:01:15,394
All right?

862
01:01:18,907 --> 01:01:20,704
Who's got a pump?

863
01:01:20,810 --> 01:01:21,969
Pump?

864
01:01:22,044 --> 01:01:24,069
Yeah, a pump.
Pump out the water.

865
01:01:47,602 --> 01:01:49,537
You cannot touch any Muslim.

866
01:01:49,602 --> 01:01:51,401
So tell me what to do,
I'll do it.

867
01:01:51,475 --> 01:01:53,942
Yeah, come over here then.
Take this.

868
01:01:54,342 --> 01:01:57,402
This finger also? I push it?
Yes, please.

869
01:01:57,947 --> 01:02:00,916
Really clean on the...
That's what's important.

870
01:02:03,119 --> 01:02:06,211
Okay. Good. The non-Muslim bodies,
where are they?

871
01:02:08,890 --> 01:02:10,221
We have them
in the next tent.

872
01:02:10,293 --> 01:02:11,554
I need to see them.

873
01:02:13,563 --> 01:02:16,327
Just take a look at these and
see if you recognize any of them please.

874
01:02:16,399 --> 01:02:18,059
Oh, those are horrible.

875
01:02:18,934 --> 01:02:21,665
No, I'm sorry,
I don't recognize either of them.

876
01:02:25,239 --> 01:02:27,401
You know, that chair outside
looks like it gets a lot of wear.

877
01:02:27,476 --> 01:02:28,876
It looks comfortable.

878
01:02:28,945 --> 01:02:30,775
Yeah, it is.
That's my mom's chair.

879
01:02:30,980 --> 01:02:32,174
She spends
a lot of time out there?

880
01:02:32,248 --> 01:02:33,475
Yeah, all day.

881
01:02:33,548 --> 01:02:36,210
All day, huh? Where is she?

882
01:02:36,519 --> 01:02:38,213
She's sleeping now.

883
01:02:38,286 --> 01:02:39,980
Then let's wake her up.

884
01:02:40,489 --> 01:02:41,478
I've seen him.

885
01:02:41,556 --> 01:02:42,580
When?

886
01:02:44,292 --> 01:02:46,284
Like a week ago.

887
01:02:46,361 --> 01:02:49,331
Twice, I've seen him
watering with the garden crews.

888
01:02:49,396 --> 01:02:50,694
And I thought that was funny.

889
01:02:50,766 --> 01:02:51,926
Funny how?

890
01:02:52,067 --> 01:02:55,833
He was a Saudi, I'm pretty sure.
The gardener.

891
01:02:57,773 --> 01:02:59,866
Yeah?
Well, Saudis, like Americans

892
01:02:59,941 --> 01:03:01,841
don't do manual labor.

893
01:03:01,910 --> 01:03:04,174
Blowing leaves is
beneath them.

894
01:03:42,852 --> 01:03:47,016
The gardener. We know who he is.
I want to take you somewhere.

895
01:03:47,089 --> 01:03:48,077
Where?

896
01:03:48,191 --> 01:03:51,387
Someone who can lead us
to catch the big dogs.

897
01:03:51,459 --> 01:03:52,483
More like the big fish.

898
01:03:52,561 --> 01:03:53,585
Big fish?

899
01:03:53,662 --> 01:03:55,494
Yeah, big fish.

900
01:03:57,232 --> 01:04:02,362
A dog... A dog is more bigger
than a fish.

901
01:04:02,637 --> 01:04:04,764
Yeah, I don't...
I didn't make it up.

902
01:04:10,812 --> 01:04:16,478
<i>Don't count on me</i>
<i>To do the things I've done before</i>

903
01:04:21,424 --> 01:04:22,550
So why'd you get into this,
Al Ghazi?

904
01:04:22,625 --> 01:04:23,682
Into what?

905
01:04:23,758 --> 01:04:25,988
Being a cop. Why'd you
get into being a cop?

906
01:04:26,062 --> 01:04:28,723
I mean, with all this
violence and chaos, it seems so crazy.

907
01:04:28,797 --> 01:04:30,731
It's because of...

908
01:04:32,602 --> 01:04:34,466
The Green Beast.
The what?

909
01:04:34,537 --> 01:04:35,696
The Green Beast.

910
01:04:35,770 --> 01:04:36,998
What the hell is
the Green Beast?

911
01:04:37,072 --> 01:04:39,562
It's a TV show when I was kid.

912
01:04:39,642 --> 01:04:41,611
You know,
a man who turns green

913
01:04:41,676 --> 01:04:44,076
when he's very angry,
he turns green and...

914
01:04:44,145 --> 01:04:45,339
Oh, oh, oh, yeah, the Hulk.

915
01:04:45,413 --> 01:04:50,077
Yeah, you know. He was killing just
bad people, because they did wrong.

916
01:04:50,151 --> 01:04:53,850
Yeah. Yeah, 'Don't make me angry.
You wouldn't like me when I'm angry.'

917
01:04:54,055 --> 01:04:56,217
Ah, you know
also Steve Austin?

918
01:04:56,291 --> 01:04:58,260
<i>Yeah, Six Million Dollar Man!</i>

919
01:04:58,326 --> 01:05:00,226
Now, that's my shit.
That's my shit.

920
01:05:00,295 --> 01:05:01,320
What? You need bathroom,
you mean?

921
01:05:01,396 --> 01:05:02,454
No, no, no.

922
01:05:02,530 --> 01:05:04,294
I can stop here if you want.
No, no, no.

923
01:05:05,468 --> 01:05:09,164
<i>Cause when those lights go on at night</i>

924
01:05:09,237 --> 01:05:12,604
<i>And light up the playgrounds then</i>

925
01:06:07,964 --> 01:06:10,090
Sir? Thank you.

926
01:06:31,787 --> 01:06:33,447
Something cooking.

927
01:06:52,674 --> 01:06:54,073
That's a gurney.

928
01:06:55,644 --> 01:06:57,008
Son of a bitch.

929
01:06:57,078 --> 01:07:00,512
Oh, God.
You know what those sons of bitches did?

930
01:07:01,414 --> 01:07:03,077
They blew up an ambulance.

931
01:07:04,120 --> 01:07:06,087
Oh, man. Now that is nasty!

932
01:07:07,389 --> 01:07:08,855
Low-down.

933
01:07:10,158 --> 01:07:12,787
I'm 42 years old.

934
01:07:14,529 --> 01:07:17,190
I have two daughters
and a son.

935
01:07:19,135 --> 01:07:20,625
Beautiful son.

936
01:07:20,702 --> 01:07:23,535
And I find myself in a place
where I no longer care

937
01:07:23,605 --> 01:07:25,732
about why we are attacked.

938
01:07:25,807 --> 01:07:30,710
I only care that 100 people
woke up a few mornings ago,

939
01:07:30,780 --> 01:07:32,838
had no idea it was their last.

940
01:07:34,583 --> 01:07:37,745
When we catch the man
who murdered these people,

941
01:07:37,953 --> 01:07:40,580
I don't care to ask
even one question.

942
01:07:41,057 --> 01:07:42,613
I want to kill him.

943
01:07:45,593 --> 01:07:47,061
Do you understand?

944
01:07:50,665 --> 01:07:52,063
Yes, I do.

945
01:07:59,408 --> 01:08:01,375
So, is your first name Colonel?

946
01:08:03,044 --> 01:08:04,034
What?

947
01:08:04,112 --> 01:08:05,443
Your first name.
What's your first name?

948
01:08:05,880 --> 01:08:06,972
Faris.

949
01:08:07,048 --> 01:08:08,140
Faris.

950
01:08:08,216 --> 01:08:09,241
Yeah.

951
01:08:09,317 --> 01:08:10,683
Officer Faris.

952
01:08:19,495 --> 01:08:21,223
Friend, hold up!

953
01:08:31,172 --> 01:08:34,700
Shit. Give me that shovel.

954
01:08:37,011 --> 01:08:39,537
Oh, we got something good, man.

955
01:08:40,249 --> 01:08:41,944
That grapple?

956
01:08:43,586 --> 01:08:45,609
Get the keys to it.
I need it down here.

957
01:08:47,055 --> 01:08:48,454
Thanks, bud.

958
01:09:25,327 --> 01:09:26,953
See that man,
through the window?

959
01:09:27,028 --> 01:09:28,222
Yeah.

960
01:09:28,329 --> 01:09:29,490
Izz Al Din.

961
01:09:29,564 --> 01:09:33,262
He joined bin Laden when Al Qaeda
brought the fight to the Royal Family.

962
01:09:33,601 --> 01:09:35,263
Does he know
where bin Laden is?

963
01:09:35,337 --> 01:09:37,770
'Cause that'd be a real big promotion
for me, if I could get that one.

964
01:09:37,839 --> 01:09:41,172
He turned himself in last year
during an amnesty.

965
01:09:41,275 --> 01:09:45,508
He's now part of a new government effort,
to balance the experience of Saudi youth.

966
01:09:45,580 --> 01:09:47,605
Oh, he's doing
community service.

967
01:09:47,917 --> 01:09:49,781
Okay.
Yes.

968
01:10:36,833 --> 01:10:40,096
The man who made war
on Al Rahmah is someone his age.

969
01:10:47,742 --> 01:10:51,235
A man who can plan mass murder
of women and children

970
01:10:51,313 --> 01:10:53,212
and then go home
and sleep soundly,

971
01:10:53,282 --> 01:10:56,444
that kind of man is
supremely difficult to catch.

972
01:10:56,518 --> 01:10:58,109
How does he know
he slept soundly?

973
01:11:03,124 --> 01:11:04,888
Because he hasn't stopped.

974
01:11:09,397 --> 01:11:13,596
You stop only when dead faces
don't let you sleep.

975
01:11:13,667 --> 01:11:14,931
Is that why you quit?

976
01:11:22,109 --> 01:11:25,602
Seventeen days without sleep
will make you quit anything.

977
01:11:35,390 --> 01:11:37,324
American military detonator.

978
01:11:37,392 --> 01:11:38,518
Yeah.

979
01:11:39,695 --> 01:11:40,992
How would they get it?

980
01:11:48,370 --> 01:11:51,828
There are several ways to get
this military equipment.

981
01:11:51,908 --> 01:11:53,533
But not everyone can get it.

982
01:11:53,608 --> 01:11:55,132
Could Abu Hamza get 'em?

983
01:12:07,655 --> 01:12:09,250
Absolutely, yes.

984
01:12:10,159 --> 01:12:13,458
Then ask him if he knows
where I can find Abu Hamza.

985
01:12:15,863 --> 01:12:18,297
Did you say something funny?
'Cause I didn't say something funny.

986
01:12:18,367 --> 01:12:21,063
Abu Hamza, he is like ghost.

987
01:12:22,037 --> 01:12:23,025
Abu Hamza like a ghost.

988
01:12:23,105 --> 01:12:24,195
Yeah, I got that.

989
01:12:25,007 --> 01:12:26,439
I understood that.

990
01:12:29,011 --> 01:12:30,170
You need...

991
01:12:30,245 --> 01:12:31,802
Yeah, prayers, luck and...

992
01:12:31,914 --> 01:12:33,276
Handshakes.

993
01:12:41,556 --> 01:12:45,687
Every bomb maker at some point
gets bitten by his own work.

994
01:13:11,054 --> 01:13:12,179
Okay, chief.

995
01:13:18,960 --> 01:13:21,122
HAYTHAM:
It's hospital identification.

996
01:13:21,196 --> 01:13:22,958
You know it?
Yes.

997
01:13:23,665 --> 01:13:24,654
Call it in.

998
01:13:24,733 --> 01:13:26,701
Look who got
the big clue!

999
01:13:26,801 --> 01:13:28,861
It's some pretty soft skin,
I'll bet you, too.

1000
01:13:28,936 --> 01:13:30,199
You know,
that mud looked pretty good.

1001
01:13:30,272 --> 01:13:32,833
Hey, hey, come on,
that's my only shirt, Grant!

1002
01:13:36,746 --> 01:13:39,475
The ambulance was stolen
from King Fahd Hospital,

1003
01:13:39,547 --> 01:13:40,536
three days before the bombing.

1004
01:13:40,616 --> 01:13:41,639
Okay.

1005
01:13:41,717 --> 01:13:46,347
I got 20 men that rotated shifts
on the stolen ambulance.

1006
01:13:46,555 --> 01:13:50,251
One of them is very important.
He's in our interest.

1007
01:13:50,326 --> 01:13:54,317
His name is Muaath Al Abdullah.
This is Fahd Al Abdullah, his brother.

1008
01:13:54,395 --> 01:13:55,886
The one that Haytham shot.

1009
01:13:55,963 --> 01:13:57,123
So where's Muaath?

1010
01:13:57,198 --> 01:13:59,497
We are going now there.
Let's go.

1011
01:13:59,800 --> 01:14:01,430
Bring your vests.

1012
01:15:33,362 --> 01:15:34,988
Fingerprints are
on the other side.

1013
01:15:35,061 --> 01:15:37,860
I'm not looking
for fingerprints.

1014
01:15:37,933 --> 01:15:39,092
Then what are you doing?

1015
01:15:39,166 --> 01:15:40,566
Fingers.

1016
01:15:55,483 --> 01:15:58,941
Pictures of the compound.
American Embassy.

1017
01:16:05,594 --> 01:16:06,618
Japan.

1018
01:16:06,695 --> 01:16:09,185
It's the Coalition.
All these countries have troops in Iraq.

1019
01:16:15,571 --> 01:16:17,699
This is meaningless, man. This is pointless.

1020
01:16:20,809 --> 01:16:22,435
What he say?

1021
01:16:22,510 --> 01:16:24,206
The Prince.
Fuck.

1022
01:16:35,457 --> 01:16:36,446
Ghazi.

1023
01:16:38,793 --> 01:16:39,817
Was anyone hurt?

1024
01:16:39,894 --> 01:16:42,261
No, nothing.
Everything under control.

1025
01:16:42,332 --> 01:16:44,093
Relax.
Were there any pictures taken?

1026
01:16:44,165 --> 01:16:47,463
No picture. Nothing, the team was safe.
Everything good.

1027
01:16:47,537 --> 01:16:49,398
I'm taking them out of here.
They're getting on a plane

1028
01:16:49,472 --> 01:16:51,769
as soon as the Prince leaves, all right?
Where are they right now?

1029
01:16:51,840 --> 01:16:53,831
They are inside.
Are they?

1030
01:16:55,077 --> 01:16:57,874
Hello. Yes, sir,
everybody's safe.

1031
01:16:58,546 --> 01:17:00,037
No, I'm next
to the corpses right now,

1032
01:17:00,115 --> 01:17:01,912
but I don't think
this is the end of this, sir.

1033
01:17:01,984 --> 01:17:05,350
To me this doesn't feel
anything like senior leadership.

1034
01:17:05,454 --> 01:17:06,443
Yeah.

1035
01:17:06,555 --> 01:17:08,284
Yes, sir, I do. I do.

1036
01:17:08,357 --> 01:17:09,346
Fleury!

1037
01:17:10,825 --> 01:17:11,814
Hey.

1038
01:17:20,036 --> 01:17:21,593
Schmidt, you all right?
Yeah.

1039
01:17:21,670 --> 01:17:22,762
You sure?
Mmm-hmm.

1040
01:17:22,838 --> 01:17:26,035
All right.
Don't throw up on your tie.

1041
01:17:28,310 --> 01:17:30,039
Want some water?
No, I'm fine.

1042
01:17:30,112 --> 01:17:31,705
You sure?
Yes!

1043
01:17:31,777 --> 01:17:34,214
You lucky bastard, Fleury.
Congratulations.

1044
01:17:34,281 --> 01:17:36,306
You won the hand
on the river card.

1045
01:17:36,384 --> 01:17:37,476
Schmidt, we didn't
win anything.

1046
01:17:37,551 --> 01:17:39,984
These are just teenagers.
Kids. Insignificant.

1047
01:17:40,055 --> 01:17:44,923
I'm looking at one, two, three,
four bad guys, a whole lot of guns.

1048
01:17:44,993 --> 01:17:47,893
This is good stuff.
You did good. Pack up.

1049
01:17:48,029 --> 01:17:50,589
Revel in the fact that when you
get home, for a few weeks,

1050
01:17:50,666 --> 01:17:52,633
your shit's not gonna stink.
All right?

1051
01:17:57,472 --> 01:17:59,203
Turn those frowns
upside-down, people.

1052
01:17:59,273 --> 01:18:03,938
This will be pitched as a stunning
Saudi-only counterpunch,

1053
01:18:04,311 --> 01:18:06,303
killing those responsible
for Al Rahmah.

1054
01:18:06,380 --> 01:18:10,612
The Al Jazeera is gonna play up the fact
that there's an F. B. I. Presence here.

1055
01:18:10,885 --> 01:18:12,547
Hello. Put that down.
Put it down.

1056
01:18:12,620 --> 01:18:13,953
Yeah. You got it.

1057
01:18:14,023 --> 01:18:16,751
It's time to go home.
The four of you are on a plane now.

1058
01:18:16,827 --> 01:18:19,190
Four vehicles will be left behind
when the Prince and the press leave.

1059
01:18:19,261 --> 01:18:21,752
You'll convoy straight to B. A. Flights
into Dulles.

1060
01:18:21,830 --> 01:18:23,297
Last-minute fares come out
of all your pockets.

1061
01:18:23,365 --> 01:18:25,333
I tried to get you an upgrade.
Doesn't look good.

1062
01:18:25,399 --> 01:18:29,299
Check at the counter. All right?
You guys are heroes. Fly safe.

1063
01:18:42,884 --> 01:18:44,977
I'm going straight
to Diamond Dan's

1064
01:18:45,053 --> 01:18:46,644
and I'm gonna order
six P. B. R.'s.

1065
01:18:46,721 --> 01:18:48,383
Pabst, Sykes? Really?

1066
01:18:48,457 --> 01:18:49,924
Yeah, first thing.
Best beer on the planet.

1067
01:18:49,991 --> 01:18:52,925
Is that how you get laid? You go
and you take a couple Pi-Phi's and you...

1068
01:18:54,229 --> 01:18:57,128
So, Al Ghazi, what do you think?
What's going on in that head of yours?

1069
01:18:57,198 --> 01:18:59,131
Haytham, you guys drink
that stuff, Pabst?

1070
01:18:59,202 --> 01:19:00,429
What is it?
It's a small win.

1071
01:19:00,502 --> 01:19:01,662
It's beer.

1072
01:19:01,737 --> 01:19:04,501
Reminds me of when
they hit the towers, first time, in '93.

1073
01:19:04,605 --> 01:19:06,437
You remember
how they caught the cell?

1074
01:19:06,508 --> 01:19:07,600
Car bomb.
Yeah.

1075
01:19:07,676 --> 01:19:10,668
He went back to get
his deposit on the rental car.

1076
01:19:10,746 --> 01:19:13,078
$400. Stupidity.

1077
01:19:13,280 --> 01:19:15,111
Then nine years later
they come back.

1078
01:19:15,283 --> 01:19:16,840
I got a feeling
I'm coming back too.

1079
01:19:16,918 --> 01:19:18,544
Yes, you will.

1080
01:19:18,984 --> 01:19:20,112
Yes, you will.

1081
01:19:20,222 --> 01:19:22,189
I didn't even know
you could still buy that.

1082
01:19:22,257 --> 01:19:23,417
It only comes
in keg form, doesn't it?

1083
01:19:23,492 --> 01:19:24,480
Oh, Schlitz,
Pabst, sure.

1084
01:19:24,593 --> 01:19:27,082
Do you think they just hand
that blue ribbon out? Do you?

1085
01:19:27,162 --> 01:19:30,426
It's not just some cute little name.
It was just Pabst.

1086
01:19:30,499 --> 01:19:32,125
And then they won a ribbon.

1087
01:19:32,201 --> 01:19:34,169
And now it's
Pabst Blue Ribbon.

1088
01:19:34,235 --> 01:19:35,328
you're doing sensitive work?
Haytham?

1089
01:19:35,402 --> 01:19:37,427
You guys have Pabst Blue Ribbon out here?
Oh, you don't even have

1090
01:19:37,505 --> 01:19:39,029
beer out there.
No, you can't drink beer.

1091
01:19:39,106 --> 01:19:41,006
They don't have beer.
No pork, no beer.

1092
01:19:41,076 --> 01:19:43,738
Yeah, I used to do
keg stands in college.

1093
01:19:43,812 --> 01:19:45,780
Oh, yeah?
Well, what, does that mean that you

1094
01:19:45,848 --> 01:19:48,713
don't like things
that are awarded the blue...

1095
01:19:51,052 --> 01:19:52,245
Brake!

1096
01:20:45,541 --> 01:20:47,565
I'm still locked in.
Get me out.

1097
01:20:48,609 --> 01:20:50,908
What are they doing?
Hold onto him!

1098
01:20:50,978 --> 01:20:52,912
Hey, Leavitt, hold on!
Don't do it!

1099
01:20:52,980 --> 01:20:54,574
Hold on! Hold on!

1100
01:20:54,950 --> 01:20:56,076
Come on, Leavitt,
hold on, baby.

1101
01:20:56,150 --> 01:20:57,276
Fuck you!

1102
01:20:57,352 --> 01:20:58,910
I got you!

1103
01:20:58,986 --> 01:21:00,648
Shit!

1104
01:21:03,158 --> 01:21:06,286
Fleury! Fleury! Fleury!

1105
01:21:09,563 --> 01:21:10,961
There's more of them!

1106
01:21:11,032 --> 01:21:12,762
Fleury! Fleury!

1107
01:21:32,954 --> 01:21:34,012
Leavitt!

1108
01:21:46,500 --> 01:21:48,023
We gotta move!

1109
01:22:13,194 --> 01:22:15,354
Al Ghazi, you've gotta put your foot
in this motherfucker. Let's go!

1110
01:22:15,430 --> 01:22:16,625
I put it! I putting foot!

1111
01:22:16,698 --> 01:22:18,687
Motherfuckers!
I'm gonna fucking kill them!

1112
01:22:18,767 --> 01:22:20,461
We cannot lose him,
you understand? We can't lose him.

1113
01:22:20,535 --> 01:22:21,559
If we lose him, he's dead.

1114
01:22:38,853 --> 01:22:39,841
Give me a MAC. Give me a MAC.

1115
01:22:39,921 --> 01:22:40,945
I see it!

1116
01:22:41,022 --> 01:22:42,046
There he is right there,
let's go!

1117
01:22:42,123 --> 01:22:43,249
Yes, yes.

1118
01:22:43,325 --> 01:22:45,623
Let's move. Let's move.
Take the left, take the left, take the left.

1119
01:22:56,806 --> 01:22:58,738
Let's go, let's go,
let's move.

1120
01:22:58,809 --> 01:22:59,865
You've lost him!
Damn it, you lost him!

1121
01:22:59,940 --> 01:23:02,034
I have not lost him!
I see him! He is in front!

1122
01:23:02,110 --> 01:23:03,166
There he is, there he is!

1123
01:23:03,243 --> 01:23:04,574
Punch it! Punch it, Al Ghazi!

1124
01:23:14,654 --> 01:23:16,146
Watch it, he just turned,
he just turned.

1125
01:23:16,223 --> 01:23:18,953
He's up there.
He's right there, don't lose him.

1126
01:23:20,495 --> 01:23:23,020
Watch out, watch out,
watch out, watch out, watch out!

1127
01:23:42,049 --> 01:23:43,745
Khaled! Khaled!

1128
01:23:52,060 --> 01:23:53,994
He went to the left!
Take a left!

1129
01:23:54,061 --> 01:23:56,461
You're gonna lose him!
Do not fucking lose him!

1130
01:24:18,887 --> 01:24:21,412
No, no, it's Suweidi.
This is not good area.

1131
01:24:21,488 --> 01:24:24,479
We shouldn't be here.
We shouldn't be here!

1132
01:24:26,394 --> 01:24:28,020
Suburban to the right.

1133
01:24:40,508 --> 01:24:42,738
Mercedes. Mercedes straight ahead.

1134
01:24:43,478 --> 01:24:44,501
All right.

1135
01:24:44,579 --> 01:24:46,411
We're in it, we're in it, we're in it.
You got it.

1136
01:24:46,481 --> 01:24:47,641
Hold up, hold up, hold up.

1137
01:25:10,937 --> 01:25:11,996
Reverse! Reverse!

1138
01:25:12,073 --> 01:25:13,973
Move, move, move.

1139
01:25:30,825 --> 01:25:31,813
Grenade!

1140
01:25:31,893 --> 01:25:33,086
Cover!

1141
01:26:35,723 --> 01:26:37,246
Move, Al Ghazi!

1142
01:26:53,942 --> 01:26:55,670
You good?
I'm good.

1143
01:26:55,842 --> 01:26:56,935
Go!

1144
01:27:26,040 --> 01:27:27,631
Cover me!

1145
01:28:00,008 --> 01:28:01,100
There's a blood trail!

1146
01:28:01,175 --> 01:28:04,837
There's a blood trail
going into the building!

1147
01:29:08,276 --> 01:29:09,903
Are you good?
Yeah, yeah, fine.

1148
01:29:09,977 --> 01:29:10,966
We gotta get backup.

1149
01:29:11,045 --> 01:29:12,205
Look,
we don't have time.

1150
01:29:12,279 --> 01:29:14,942
We need two to backup here.
The other three go inside.

1151
01:29:15,016 --> 01:29:16,415
Haytham.
Okay. You good, Sykes?

1152
01:29:16,650 --> 01:29:18,119
Yeah, I got backup!
Go, go.

1153
01:29:18,187 --> 01:29:20,814
Let's go.
Go, go, go, go, go!

1154
01:29:21,087 --> 01:29:22,420
This is very bad neighborhood.

1155
01:29:22,490 --> 01:29:24,220
Yeah, no shit.

1156
01:30:21,682 --> 01:30:24,549
Which side of the door
you think Allah is on?

1157
01:30:24,854 --> 01:30:27,377
We are about to find out.

1158
01:32:16,229 --> 01:32:17,492
Fuck!

1159
01:32:30,111 --> 01:32:32,306
<i>It's okay! Malesh! Malesh!</i>

1160
01:32:32,413 --> 01:32:36,783
<i>Stay here! Malesh! Malesh.</i>
Stay here! Stay here!

1161
01:34:03,039 --> 01:34:05,266
Leavitt! You okay?

1162
01:34:14,949 --> 01:34:16,472
Haytham! I got this!

1163
01:34:16,549 --> 01:34:18,576
Go inside and see
how they're doing.

1164
01:35:23,853 --> 01:35:25,840
You okay?

1165
01:35:30,659 --> 01:35:32,558
Oh, I have something.

1166
01:36:42,429 --> 01:36:44,192
Abu Hamza.

1167
01:36:47,102 --> 01:36:48,899
Get out!

1168
01:36:50,205 --> 01:36:51,502
Put it down! Put it down!

1169
01:36:51,571 --> 01:36:53,231
You put that fucking gun down!

1170
01:36:53,308 --> 01:36:54,638
Put it down.
Put that gun down.

1171
01:36:54,708 --> 01:36:56,539
Put it down!
Put that fucking gun down!

1172
01:36:56,610 --> 01:36:58,805
Put the fucking gun down right now!
Put the gun down!

1173
01:37:01,147 --> 01:37:02,273
Ali.

1174
01:37:02,348 --> 01:37:03,646
Fuck.

1175
01:37:09,588 --> 01:37:12,251
Go, go, go, go.

1176
01:37:12,326 --> 01:37:16,263
Hold on. Fuck.
Hold on, buddy. Hold on.

1177
01:37:16,331 --> 01:37:19,390
Hold on. Hold on.
Breathe, breathe, breathe, fucking breathe.

1178
01:37:19,466 --> 01:37:23,062
It's okay. God, he's just a kid.
He's just a kid.

1179
01:37:26,272 --> 01:37:30,299
It's all right, I got you, I got you,
I got you, I got you. I got you.

1180
01:37:31,612 --> 01:37:33,705
I got you. Just calm down. Relax.
Relax, relax. Gotta breathe.

1181
01:37:33,780 --> 01:37:37,147
You gotta breathe, you gotta breathe.
Breathe, breathe, breathe.

1182
01:37:37,651 --> 01:37:40,620
Relax, relax. You gotta breathe.
You gotta breathe.

1183
01:37:43,123 --> 01:37:45,819
Let's get a fucking ambulance!

1184
01:37:55,336 --> 01:37:58,362
We got 'em. We got 'em. We got 'em.
We got 'em, okay? We got 'em all.

1185
01:37:58,439 --> 01:38:00,532
Just relax. Relax, baby.

1186
01:38:00,708 --> 01:38:02,230
Come on,
you gotta stay with us.

1187
01:38:02,309 --> 01:38:04,301
You gotta stay with us.
You gotta...

1188
01:38:04,845 --> 01:38:06,938
Faris! Faris!

1189
01:38:28,535 --> 01:38:31,867
Yeah. We got 'em, baby.
We got 'em.

1190
01:39:34,667 --> 01:39:37,865
My condolences.
Thank you.

1191
01:40:21,215 --> 01:40:23,272
This is his son, Sultan.

1192
01:40:23,351 --> 01:40:24,909
Sultan. Hey.

1193
01:40:29,623 --> 01:40:33,320
Tell him that his father
was a very brave man.

1194
01:40:43,638 --> 01:40:46,538
He asks if you know his father.

1195
01:40:47,941 --> 01:40:49,306
Yeah.

1196
01:40:52,712 --> 01:40:57,309
I knew your father,
your father was a good friend of mine.

1197
01:41:07,294 --> 01:41:08,785
All right.

1198
01:41:51,371 --> 01:41:53,362
Thank you, Sergeant Haytham.

1199
01:41:53,440 --> 01:41:54,737
Thank you.

1200
01:41:56,710 --> 01:41:58,439
Thank you, man.

1201
01:41:58,513 --> 01:42:00,845
This is to keep away
your worries.

1202
01:42:04,185 --> 01:42:07,050
Thanks, man.

1203
01:42:32,813 --> 01:42:34,779
We testify next Tuesday.

1204
01:42:34,882 --> 01:42:36,874
Fleury goes first.
But I'm gonna go through it

1205
01:42:36,951 --> 01:42:39,510
with each of you one-on-one,
in advance, just to make sure

1206
01:42:39,586 --> 01:42:41,452
we're all on the same page.

1207
01:42:41,988 --> 01:42:44,685
If they ask you, if we've talked about
any of this, the answer is

1208
01:42:44,758 --> 01:42:47,591
unequivocally no, okay?

1209
01:42:48,462 --> 01:42:53,229
You did outstanding work over there.
You hold your heads high.

1210
01:43:03,811 --> 01:43:05,005
Fleury.

1211
01:43:05,812 --> 01:43:09,408
Tell me what you whispered to Janet,
in the briefing, to get her to stop crying

1212
01:43:09,483 --> 01:43:12,477
about Fran, you know,
before all this, before we even got airborne.

1213
01:43:12,554 --> 01:43:14,544
What'd you say to her?

1214
01:43:25,766 --> 01:43:27,233
You remember?

1215
01:43:34,608 --> 01:43:37,577
I told her we were
gonna kill them all.
