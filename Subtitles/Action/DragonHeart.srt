1
00:01:02,829 --> 00:01:04,763
Not bad.

2
00:01:07,901 --> 00:01:10,495
But not good enough to live.

3
00:01:20,113 --> 00:01:24,413
Mind if I sit down?
I don't have your energy.

4
00:01:24,451 --> 00:01:26,749
Fight with your head.

5
00:01:29,522 --> 00:01:31,615
Not your heart.

6
00:01:44,637 --> 00:01:46,605
Straight.

7
00:01:46,639 --> 00:01:49,107
Better, Einon.

8
00:01:49,142 --> 00:01:51,975
But you're still dead.

9
00:01:58,751 --> 00:02:01,219
Purpose, not passion.

10
00:02:11,898 --> 00:02:14,890
No one ever found victory
in the dirt.

11
00:02:18,771 --> 00:02:20,796
The peasants are revolting.

12
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:23,172
They've always been revoltin', Prince.

13
00:02:23,276 --> 00:02:25,506
But now they're rebellin'.

14
00:02:25,578 --> 00:02:29,173
King Freyne wants his son
to witness his noble victory.

15
00:02:29,249 --> 00:02:32,810
There's nothing noble
about crushing desperate men.

16
00:02:32,852 --> 00:02:34,820
They're traitorous scum!

17
00:02:34,854 --> 00:02:37,118
The king commands!
Bring him!

18
00:02:41,461 --> 00:02:44,624
You can come, too, nursemaid.

19
00:03:48,928 --> 00:03:51,761
Die, you dog!

20
00:04:02,775 --> 00:04:05,938
- I wish we were down there.
- No, you don't.

21
00:04:06,045 --> 00:04:08,445
Yes, I do. Just to see you
in action, Bowen.

22
00:04:08,514 --> 00:04:11,108
Yours would be
the finest blade on the field.

23
00:04:11,184 --> 00:04:14,119
My blade was not made
for your father's slaughter.

24
00:04:14,187 --> 00:04:17,281
He is my father, Bowen,
and he is the king.

25
00:04:17,357 --> 00:04:19,291
Yes.

26
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:21,759
But when you are king,
remember today...

27
00:04:21,794 --> 00:04:24,627
and the difference
between battle and butchery.

28
00:04:24,731 --> 00:04:26,926
And remember the Old Code.

29
00:04:26,966 --> 00:04:29,127
Then you'll be a greater king
than your father.

30
00:04:32,071 --> 00:04:34,301
I promise, Knight...

31
00:04:34,407 --> 00:04:36,932
I will be greater.

32
00:05:13,846 --> 00:05:16,508
Freyne!

33
00:05:16,582 --> 00:05:20,018
Now, Hewe, now!

34
00:05:32,532 --> 00:05:35,365
- He's trapped!
- Einon!

35
00:05:35,435 --> 00:05:37,369
Einon!

36
00:05:46,679 --> 00:05:49,546
Einon, no!

37
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:05,730
Enough! Enough!

38
00:06:05,832 --> 00:06:08,130
The battle's out there!

39
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:31,417
Father?

40
00:06:45,605 --> 00:06:48,369
Die! It's mine!

41
00:07:36,656 --> 00:07:39,284
Einon! Einon!

42
00:07:40,893 --> 00:07:42,986
I'm here, Einon!

43
00:07:43,095 --> 00:07:45,962
I'm here, my King.

44
00:08:16,361 --> 00:08:18,329
Dead, madam.

45
00:08:18,363 --> 00:08:22,663
King Freyne,
your husband, slain.

46
00:08:25,870 --> 00:08:27,861
In here!

47
00:08:30,542 --> 00:08:33,670
In here, on the bed.

48
00:08:38,783 --> 00:08:41,684
Get out! Out!
Out! Brok, out!

49
00:08:43,321 --> 00:08:45,380
You stay, Bowen.

50
00:08:50,362 --> 00:08:53,160
Forgive me, Queen Aislinn.

51
00:08:54,699 --> 00:08:57,167
There's nothing to forgive.

52
00:08:57,235 --> 00:08:59,863
His father's tyranny
brought him to this end.

53
00:09:03,008 --> 00:09:05,408
He's beyond all help.

54
00:09:14,886 --> 00:09:16,820
Not all.

55
00:09:21,893 --> 00:09:23,918
A knight is sworn to valor.

56
00:09:24,029 --> 00:09:26,259
Sworn to valor.

57
00:09:26,331 --> 00:09:28,765
- His heart knows only virtue.
- Virtue.

58
00:09:28,867 --> 00:09:32,928
His blade defends the helpless.

59
00:09:33,004 --> 00:09:35,063
His might upholds the weak.

60
00:09:37,275 --> 00:09:39,505
You must stay awake, my son!

61
00:09:39,577 --> 00:09:42,011
- You must stay awake. Repeat the Code.
- The Code.

62
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:44,071
His might upholds the weak.

63
00:09:44,115 --> 00:09:47,346
H-His word speaks only truth.

64
00:09:47,419 --> 00:09:49,353
His wrath--

65
00:09:49,421 --> 00:09:51,446
Undoes the wicked.

66
00:10:03,234 --> 00:10:05,566
Brok, stay there.

67
00:10:14,245 --> 00:10:17,612
Lord! Great one!

68
00:10:21,219 --> 00:10:23,813
Your song is sad!

69
00:10:23,922 --> 00:10:26,550
Are the stars shining tonight?

70
00:10:26,624 --> 00:10:30,492
No. No bright souls
glitter in this darkness.

71
00:10:37,736 --> 00:10:40,500
Leave us. Go.

72
00:10:42,107 --> 00:10:44,575
Aislinn, daughter of the Celts.

73
00:10:44,642 --> 00:10:48,169
Whose people loved your kind
and called you friend.

74
00:10:48,246 --> 00:10:51,181
Ah, the king's son...

75
00:10:51,282 --> 00:10:53,682
cruel and full of trickery.

76
00:10:53,785 --> 00:10:57,778
- Is this why you've come,
dragonslayer's wife?
- Dragonslayer's widow!

77
00:10:59,157 --> 00:11:02,649
This boy is not his father.

78
00:11:02,694 --> 00:11:05,925
This knight here is his mentor.
He has taught him the Old Code.

79
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:10,700
I need your help.

80
00:11:23,148 --> 00:11:25,309
The wound is deep.

81
00:11:25,383 --> 00:11:27,943
You know what you ask.

82
00:11:28,019 --> 00:11:30,613
I will teach him your ways.

83
00:11:30,688 --> 00:11:33,782
He will grow in your grace.
He will grow just and good.

84
00:11:33,858 --> 00:11:35,792
I swear.

85
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:40,058
No! The boy must swear.
Give me your sword, Knight.

86
00:11:40,131 --> 00:11:42,065
Your sword!

87
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:52,741
Do not be afraid.
He can save you.

88
00:11:52,811 --> 00:11:54,745
Now listen to me, boy.

89
00:11:54,813 --> 00:11:58,544
Swear that your father's
blood lust and tyranny died with him.

90
00:11:58,583 --> 00:12:01,746
Swear that you will live
and rule with mercy.

91
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:04,254
Come to me
and learn the Once-ways.

92
00:12:04,322 --> 00:12:06,256
Now swear!

93
00:12:06,324 --> 00:12:08,690
I swear.

94
00:12:20,572 --> 00:12:22,506
He's dead!

95
00:12:23,942 --> 00:12:27,275
Peace, Knight of the Old Code.

96
00:12:27,345 --> 00:12:30,280
Witness the wonders
of an ancient glory.

97
00:13:22,267 --> 00:13:24,792
Half my heart
to make you whole.

98
00:13:24,836 --> 00:13:27,999
Its strength
to purify your weakness.

99
00:13:28,106 --> 00:13:31,473
Live, and remember your oath.

100
00:14:07,278 --> 00:14:11,374
I served the father only
for the sake of the son.

101
00:14:11,449 --> 00:14:14,282
All my hopes rest on him.

102
00:14:14,352 --> 00:14:16,843
Forgive a doubting fool.

103
00:14:16,888 --> 00:14:21,052
Call when you need of me.
Ask what you will of me.

104
00:14:21,159 --> 00:14:25,289
My sword, my service are yours.

105
00:14:25,363 --> 00:14:28,992
Only remind him
always of his vow...

106
00:14:29,067 --> 00:14:32,059
Knight of the Old Code.

107
00:14:44,716 --> 00:14:46,650
Brok.

108
00:14:47,418 --> 00:14:49,545
Your Majesty?

109
00:14:49,587 --> 00:14:52,750
The Romans built
this great fortress.

110
00:14:52,824 --> 00:14:56,316
I will rebuild it,
and mine will be greater.

111
00:14:58,363 --> 00:15:01,526
It will take many men, my Lord,
to rebuild this ruin.

112
00:15:02,367 --> 00:15:04,426
Yes.

113
00:15:04,502 --> 00:15:06,766
Yes, it will.

114
00:15:37,969 --> 00:15:39,869
Not so rebellious now.

115
00:15:39,937 --> 00:15:44,033
You should thank me, boy.
It was my stroke made you king.

116
00:15:45,943 --> 00:15:49,640
No, Brok, I want no martyrs.

117
00:15:49,714 --> 00:15:52,080
Death should be a release,
not a punishment.

118
00:15:55,053 --> 00:15:56,987
Look good, dog.

119
00:15:57,055 --> 00:15:59,148
I'm the last thing
you'll ever see.

120
00:16:00,658 --> 00:16:02,558
Burn the insolence
out of his eyes.

121
00:16:04,095 --> 00:16:07,223
No! No!
Not my eyes! No!

122
00:16:07,298 --> 00:16:09,630
Father!

123
00:16:10,501 --> 00:16:12,435
Run!

124
00:16:20,278 --> 00:16:22,678
How dare you defy me!

125
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:26,341
Einon, you're unwell.
You've been bewitched.

126
00:16:26,417 --> 00:16:28,681
Look at this!
It's madness!

127
00:16:30,021 --> 00:16:32,421
- Remember the Code!
- The king is above the Code!

128
00:16:35,426 --> 00:16:37,860
Have you forgotten
everything I taught you?

129
00:16:37,929 --> 00:16:41,695
No one is above the Code...

130
00:16:41,799 --> 00:16:44,529
especially the king.

131
00:17:05,656 --> 00:17:09,057
Dragon, I loved that boy,
and you changed him!

132
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:11,390
You tricked me, Dragon!

133
00:17:11,462 --> 00:17:14,625
No matter where you fly...

134
00:17:14,699 --> 00:17:17,896
no matter where you go,
I will find you!

135
00:17:19,036 --> 00:17:21,903
Today I make a new vow!

136
00:17:21,973 --> 00:17:26,410
I will spend the rest of my life
hunting you down!

137
00:17:31,082 --> 00:17:33,983
Avalon, oh, Avalon.

138
00:17:34,051 --> 00:17:36,713
For you I quest each day...

139
00:17:36,754 --> 00:17:39,222
the resting place of Arthur...

140
00:17:39,256 --> 00:17:42,384
and the Old Code of his way.

141
00:17:42,426 --> 00:17:45,418
And when I find
those holy stones...

142
00:17:45,496 --> 00:17:49,262
I'll pray, I'll pray, I'll pray.

143
00:17:49,367 --> 00:17:52,234
Oh, Avalon, bright Avalon...

144
00:17:52,269 --> 00:17:55,102
think me not a fool.

145
00:17:55,172 --> 00:18:00,075
My quest is not for vanity,
my quest is spiritual.

146
00:18:00,111 --> 00:18:02,272
Spiritual!

147
00:18:02,346 --> 00:18:05,577
Merlin, spiritual!

148
00:18:05,616 --> 00:18:08,016
Whoa! Merlin!

149
00:18:08,085 --> 00:18:10,019
Merlin! Ow!

150
00:18:14,759 --> 00:18:17,125
Everyone's a critic!

151
00:18:38,983 --> 00:18:41,645
- Dragon, dragon.
- Yes, I know. Where?

152
00:18:41,719 --> 00:18:44,313
There, there.

153
00:19:18,422 --> 00:19:21,482
Get back here, horse.
You coward.

154
00:19:25,529 --> 00:19:30,023
Marvelous! Heroics befitting the days
of Arthur and the Round Table!

155
00:19:30,134 --> 00:19:32,261
Never have I seen such skill!

156
00:19:32,336 --> 00:19:35,362
Then you must have lived
the sheltered life...

157
00:19:35,439 --> 00:19:37,532
of a mon-- monk.

158
00:19:37,641 --> 00:19:41,372
Why, yes. A scribe, scholar,
historian and poet.

159
00:19:41,479 --> 00:19:44,380
Your servant, sir,
Brother Gilbert of Glockenspur.

160
00:19:44,448 --> 00:19:47,940
My humble life is in debt
to your exalted prowess...

161
00:19:48,018 --> 00:19:51,715
your dauntless courage,
and your superb, swift sword.

162
00:19:51,822 --> 00:19:53,881
You have the poet's gift
of exaggeration.

163
00:19:53,958 --> 00:19:56,119
Sir, you should read
my histories.

164
00:19:56,193 --> 00:20:00,061
But you belittle your talent.
Modesty as well as valor.

165
00:20:00,164 --> 00:20:02,860
The Code of ancient Camelot
still lives.

166
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:07,337
Hardly worthy of Camelot.
Still, it's one less dragon.

167
00:20:10,674 --> 00:20:13,006
Well done, Knight!
Congratulations.

168
00:20:13,077 --> 00:20:15,307
Our gratitude,
mine and King Einon's.

169
00:20:15,379 --> 00:20:18,576
Uh, you can keep your gratitude.
I'll take the gold.

170
00:20:18,682 --> 00:20:21,048
- Yours or the king's.
- Gold, Knight?

171
00:20:21,085 --> 00:20:24,577
We made a bargain, remember?
One dragon put down, one bag of gold.

172
00:20:24,688 --> 00:20:27,384
Your honor has a price,
Sir Knight?

173
00:20:27,424 --> 00:20:29,756
It has expenses.

174
00:20:29,860 --> 00:20:32,420
Honor won't feed my belly
nor shoe my horse.

175
00:20:32,496 --> 00:20:34,555
The priest is right.

176
00:20:34,598 --> 00:20:38,557
It is your duty to protect King Einon's
vassals as a knight of the realm.

177
00:20:38,602 --> 00:20:41,366
Not of this realm.
I bend no knee to Einon.

178
00:20:42,773 --> 00:20:45,606
I should have known.
Foreign riffraff!

179
00:20:45,676 --> 00:20:48,372
Well, begone, vagabond,
before I arrest you!

180
00:20:49,847 --> 00:20:51,781
Back to work, you scum!

181
00:20:51,882 --> 00:20:55,045
If King Einon's wheat
isn't cut before the rain...

182
00:20:55,119 --> 00:20:57,553
I'll do a little cutting
of my own!

183
00:20:58,522 --> 00:21:00,717
Sir Knight!
Sir Knight, wait!

184
00:21:02,393 --> 00:21:04,020
Sir Knight!

185
00:21:04,094 --> 00:21:06,119
Hear me out!

186
00:21:06,197 --> 00:21:08,757
I'm on a pilgrimage.
Might we travel together?

187
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:12,098
The road's still free,
unless Einon's taxed it.

188
00:21:21,979 --> 00:21:25,710
A road tax, King Einon. Hmm?

189
00:21:25,783 --> 00:21:28,308
A road tax.

190
00:21:29,486 --> 00:21:31,454
They are your roads, after all.

191
00:21:31,488 --> 00:21:33,956
People really ought to pay
for the privilege of using them.

192
00:21:33,991 --> 00:21:37,119
- And those that can't pay
will have to work it off.
- lngenious, Felton.

193
00:21:37,161 --> 00:21:39,959
Only you could keep such a good brain
under such a bad hat.

194
00:21:39,997 --> 00:21:43,160
That's very good, "bad hat."

195
00:21:43,234 --> 00:21:45,498
Out of my way, peacock.

196
00:21:45,569 --> 00:21:48,629
Brok, some are good at hunting men,
some are good at hunting money.

197
00:21:48,672 --> 00:21:51,402
Both have value for me.

198
00:22:55,139 --> 00:22:57,073
Kara?

199
00:22:59,243 --> 00:23:02,212
Kara, I told you--

200
00:23:02,246 --> 00:23:05,807
- I told you not to come here anymore.
- I'm a disobedient child.

201
00:23:06,850 --> 00:23:10,308
Go on. Take a drink. Go on.

202
00:23:11,488 --> 00:23:13,581
Magnificent shot, Your Highness!

203
00:23:13,691 --> 00:23:16,922
- Care to double the wager?
- Ah, yes, happily.

204
00:23:16,994 --> 00:23:18,985
Shall we say the water bucket?

205
00:23:19,063 --> 00:23:21,361
Stand still. Stand still.

206
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:26,094
Superb!

207
00:23:26,203 --> 00:23:28,103
Double again?

208
00:23:28,205 --> 00:23:31,003
Double again. Why not?

209
00:23:32,943 --> 00:23:35,241
I say.

210
00:23:35,279 --> 00:23:37,270
A moving target.

211
00:23:37,381 --> 00:23:39,440
Peasant scum.

212
00:23:46,090 --> 00:23:48,854
You've got a nerve,
interfering with the king's sport!

213
00:23:48,926 --> 00:23:51,622
There's no sport
in tormenting a sick, old man.

214
00:23:53,297 --> 00:23:56,789
I beg Your Majesty,
let him go.

215
00:23:56,867 --> 00:24:00,359
It's been 12 years.
Your castle is built.

216
00:24:01,638 --> 00:24:03,902
He can do you no more harm.

217
00:24:05,743 --> 00:24:08,303
For God's sake, release him.

218
00:24:13,984 --> 00:24:16,475
Father!

219
00:24:16,587 --> 00:24:19,215
I've always said death is a release,
not a punishment.

220
00:24:19,289 --> 00:24:21,814
Go.

221
00:24:27,064 --> 00:24:28,998
Kara.

222
00:25:14,010 --> 00:25:17,036
Yoo-hoo!
Yoo-hoo!

223
00:25:17,113 --> 00:25:20,708
I've decided to compose
"The Ballad of Bowen"!

224
00:25:20,817 --> 00:25:25,015
- How do you prefer I should write this?
- Far away!

225
00:25:25,054 --> 00:25:28,285
Oh, don't concern yourself
with my safety!

226
00:25:28,357 --> 00:25:31,520
I mean verse, meter.

227
00:25:32,795 --> 00:25:36,162
Shall I spice it up
with a poetical flourish...

228
00:25:36,232 --> 00:25:38,860
or just the cold, hard facts?

229
00:25:38,901 --> 00:25:40,869
If you do not be quiet...

230
00:25:40,903 --> 00:25:43,895
you and I shall be the only things
that are cold and hard around here.

231
00:25:44,006 --> 00:25:47,908
I mean, it's all very well to go
hacking and whacking at dragons.

232
00:25:47,977 --> 00:25:52,573
But if a dragon falls in the
forest and nobody gets to hear
about it, does it make a thud?

233
00:25:52,648 --> 00:25:55,208
- Brother Gilbert.
- What?

234
00:26:05,194 --> 00:26:08,527
The quill is mightier than the s--

235
00:26:08,598 --> 00:26:10,532
Ooh.

236
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:14,229
The quill is mightier than the--

237
00:26:22,879 --> 00:26:25,939
That's all that's left
of the last dragonslayer...

238
00:26:26,048 --> 00:26:28,278
who tangled with me!

239
00:26:28,384 --> 00:26:30,784
If I were you,
I'd quit while I was ahead.

240
00:26:38,728 --> 00:26:42,186
Is that the best you can do?

241
00:26:46,135 --> 00:26:48,103
Catch!

242
00:26:48,137 --> 00:26:51,629
You know, I've got quite
a collection of victims in here.

243
00:26:51,741 --> 00:26:53,936
I won't be added to it!

244
00:26:56,812 --> 00:26:59,940
I've given you
my final warning.

245
00:26:59,982 --> 00:27:02,951
Into the mouth of death he strode.

246
00:27:02,985 --> 00:27:06,045
Into the gringy gloom.

247
00:27:06,122 --> 00:27:08,886
Into the pit of fear unknown...

248
00:27:08,958 --> 00:27:11,620
perhaps to court his doom.

249
00:27:11,661 --> 00:27:14,221
That was good.

250
00:27:14,297 --> 00:27:16,629
What did I say?
What did I say?

251
00:27:24,340 --> 00:27:27,002
A little damp for fire,
isn't it?

252
00:27:27,109 --> 00:27:30,806
Why must you knight-errands
out to make a name for yourselves...

253
00:27:30,846 --> 00:27:32,837
always pick on us dragons?

254
00:27:32,949 --> 00:27:35,281
I don't need a name!

255
00:27:35,351 --> 00:27:37,649
And I have a collection of my own!

256
00:27:37,687 --> 00:27:41,145
Yeah? You're one
who kills dragons for money.

257
00:27:41,190 --> 00:27:43,624
It's honest enough work.

258
00:27:43,693 --> 00:27:45,661
One must earn a living.

259
00:27:45,695 --> 00:27:49,859
Oh, yes, one must live.

260
00:27:49,966 --> 00:27:53,868
Well, since you seek a profit,
we might as well begin.

261
00:27:53,970 --> 00:27:56,530
Oh, don't flatter yourself.

262
00:27:56,605 --> 00:28:00,041
It's not the profit.
It's the pleasure.

263
00:28:00,142 --> 00:28:04,340
Perhaps less pleasurable
and more costly than you think!

264
00:28:09,352 --> 00:28:12,185
Bowen! Bowen, take care!

265
00:28:12,221 --> 00:28:14,883
He went that way!

266
00:28:14,991 --> 00:28:17,118
Take care, Bowen!

267
00:29:07,843 --> 00:29:10,437
You can't fly forever!

268
00:29:10,546 --> 00:29:14,073
- Neither can you!
- Slow down!

269
00:29:14,116 --> 00:29:17,711
Come, visit the woods!

270
00:29:19,789 --> 00:29:22,121
Whoa!

271
00:29:28,764 --> 00:29:32,598
Look out! Well done!

272
00:29:32,635 --> 00:29:35,627
- Ow!
- Pity. That must have hurt.

273
00:29:35,738 --> 00:29:37,797
- Yeah!
- Again?

274
00:29:37,907 --> 00:29:39,807
- Ow!
- And again?

275
00:29:39,875 --> 00:29:42,105
How do you like the ride so far?

276
00:29:43,913 --> 00:29:46,814
We're earning our money now,
aren't we?

277
00:29:48,617 --> 00:29:51,780
Now, is there somewhere you
would like me to drop you off?

278
00:29:58,928 --> 00:30:01,396
Yikes!

279
00:30:07,903 --> 00:30:12,067
The sword against the fang and claw.
The flame against the shield.

280
00:30:12,141 --> 00:30:14,132
Blah, blah, blah,
which one would win?

281
00:30:14,176 --> 00:30:17,839
Blah, blah,
field, shield, wield.

282
00:30:17,947 --> 00:30:20,575
Whose flesh from bones
be peeled. Oh, no.

283
00:30:20,649 --> 00:30:24,642
Whose fate would soon be sealed.

284
00:30:24,687 --> 00:30:26,678
Whose fate would soon be sealed?

285
00:30:26,789 --> 00:30:29,815
Whose fate would soon be sealed!

286
00:30:31,861 --> 00:30:36,321
Oh, you're good. Haven't had
this sort of challenge in some time.

287
00:30:36,365 --> 00:30:38,458
Nor likely to again!

288
00:31:04,894 --> 00:31:06,828
Drat!

289
00:31:12,334 --> 00:31:14,734
A little overconfident, aren't we?

290
00:31:14,837 --> 00:31:18,398
Hardly. But if you win,
you'll be out of work.

291
00:31:18,474 --> 00:31:22,410
I will not stop until I've rid the world
of every last one of you.

292
00:31:22,511 --> 00:31:24,741
I am the last one!

293
00:31:47,403 --> 00:31:51,430
You're just trying to save
your scaly hide with tricks.

294
00:31:53,842 --> 00:31:56,572
Haven't you noticed the pickings
are rather slim these days?

295
00:31:57,613 --> 00:31:59,945
I got me one just the other day.

296
00:32:00,049 --> 00:32:04,452
So it was you who killed the
Scarred One. She and I were the last.

297
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:07,421
Must've been a proud kill, warrior.

298
00:32:07,456 --> 00:32:10,789
How much gold did her tattered carcass
put in your purse?

299
00:32:10,893 --> 00:32:13,020
That's none of your business.

300
00:32:13,095 --> 00:32:16,866
Couldn't have been very much.
And you'll kill me for sport?

301
00:32:16,999 --> 00:32:19,797
And when there are
no more dragons to slay...

302
00:32:19,902 --> 00:32:22,029
how will you make
a living, Knight?

303
00:32:22,104 --> 00:32:23,867
Shut up!

304
00:32:39,121 --> 00:32:41,487
Whoa!

305
00:32:43,993 --> 00:32:48,828
If your teeth come down, my sword
goes up, right into your brain!

306
00:32:54,003 --> 00:32:57,769
If your sword goes up,
my teeth come down!

307
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:01,503
Into the moonlit night
the titans dueled...

308
00:33:01,610 --> 00:33:04,511
in mortal combat bound.

309
00:33:04,613 --> 00:33:09,073
Oh, who'd the fatal
false step make?

310
00:33:09,151 --> 00:33:12,518
Whose blood
would stain the ground?

311
00:33:32,041 --> 00:33:35,602
Oh, good Lord.
Sir Eglamore.

312
00:33:35,678 --> 00:33:38,704
Oh, thank you very much.

313
00:33:38,781 --> 00:33:41,045
It's been stuck down there
for months.

314
00:33:41,116 --> 00:33:43,380
Can you get your buttocks
off my tongue?

315
00:33:43,452 --> 00:33:45,545
Why should you
be comfortable?

316
00:33:45,654 --> 00:33:50,023
My armor is rusting in your drool,
and your breath is absolutely foul.

317
00:33:50,059 --> 00:33:52,186
Well, what do you expect...

318
00:33:52,227 --> 00:33:55,196
with old knights
rotting between my molars?

319
00:33:55,230 --> 00:33:57,357
Oh, God, my mouth is so dry.

320
00:34:00,569 --> 00:34:02,867
No, no, no, stop!

321
00:34:02,905 --> 00:34:04,896
No, stop!

322
00:34:08,210 --> 00:34:11,407
Sorry about that.

323
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:14,415
It seems we're in a bit
of a stalemate, wouldn't you say?

324
00:34:14,516 --> 00:34:17,576
Yuck! But I can go
three days without sleep.

325
00:34:17,686 --> 00:34:19,813
I can go three weeks.

326
00:34:19,888 --> 00:34:23,324
Ooh! I'll stab you
before I nod off.

327
00:34:23,392 --> 00:34:27,761
And I'll chomp you.
Marvelous, we'll kill each other.

328
00:34:27,863 --> 00:34:30,388
- What do you suggest?
- A truce.

329
00:34:30,432 --> 00:34:33,560
Get out of my mouth
and let's talk face-to-face.

330
00:34:33,602 --> 00:34:36,435
How do I know I can trust you?

331
00:34:36,505 --> 00:34:39,372
I give you my word.

332
00:34:39,441 --> 00:34:42,501
The word of a dragon.
It's worthless.

333
00:34:42,578 --> 00:34:46,105
Stubborn lout!

334
00:34:49,385 --> 00:34:52,286
I should have known!

335
00:34:52,388 --> 00:34:55,186
Go on. Kill me!

336
00:34:59,962 --> 00:35:02,795
I don't want to kill you!
I never did!

337
00:35:02,898 --> 00:35:05,298
And I don't want you to kill me!

338
00:35:05,401 --> 00:35:07,301
How do we gain?

339
00:35:07,403 --> 00:35:10,395
If you win, you lose a trade.

340
00:35:10,472 --> 00:35:13,305
If I win, I wait around
for the next sword slinger...

341
00:35:13,409 --> 00:35:15,900
thirsting to carve a reputation
out of my hide.

342
00:35:17,079 --> 00:35:19,309
And I'm tired of lurking in holes...

343
00:35:19,415 --> 00:35:21,440
and skulking in darkness.

344
00:35:22,284 --> 00:35:24,218
I'm gonna let you up now.

345
00:35:24,286 --> 00:35:26,652
And if you insist...

346
00:35:26,722 --> 00:35:30,158
we can pursue this fracas
to its final stupidity.

347
00:35:30,225 --> 00:35:34,389
Or you can listen
to my alternative.

348
00:35:43,272 --> 00:35:45,001
Hmm?

349
00:35:45,074 --> 00:35:48,168
What's the alternative?

350
00:35:53,348 --> 00:35:56,340
Father, Father, look!

351
00:35:59,188 --> 00:36:01,156
Dragon!

352
00:36:05,327 --> 00:36:08,194
Out of the way!
Out of the way!

353
00:36:08,263 --> 00:36:10,322
Out of the way!

354
00:36:36,859 --> 00:36:39,521
Pesky critters, dragons.

355
00:36:41,296 --> 00:36:43,230
You!

356
00:36:43,298 --> 00:36:46,734
Like big rats.
You never seem to get rid of them.

357
00:36:46,835 --> 00:36:50,566
Unless you pay me
two bags of gold, in advance.

358
00:36:59,248 --> 00:37:01,375
Come on, Dragon.

359
00:37:03,252 --> 00:37:05,846
Come on, Dragon.

360
00:37:07,089 --> 00:37:09,057
Yes!

361
00:37:10,692 --> 00:37:12,592
Ow!

362
00:38:00,776 --> 00:38:04,075
Hmm.

363
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:07,414
Hello.

364
00:38:08,483 --> 00:38:12,044
Twenty-eight, twenty-nine.

365
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:15,487
Most profitable, Dragon.
I should have met you a long time ago.

366
00:38:15,557 --> 00:38:17,991
There is much gold in the world.

367
00:38:18,060 --> 00:38:21,723
Perhaps when you've had your fill of it,
you'll no longer need me.

368
00:38:21,797 --> 00:38:25,324
I am a Knight of the Old Code.
My word is my bond.

369
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:28,927
- No compunctions then?
- About what?

370
00:38:29,004 --> 00:38:33,065
Well, such deception hardly befits
a Knight of the Old Code.

371
00:38:33,141 --> 00:38:37,669
Fleecing Einon's lackeys.
That's a service to mankind.

372
00:38:37,779 --> 00:38:39,337
Is it?

373
00:38:39,448 --> 00:38:42,508
When you squeeze the nobility,
it's the peasants who feel the pinch.

374
00:38:42,584 --> 00:38:44,779
That's not my concern.

375
00:38:44,853 --> 00:38:48,448
Why should I stick my neck out
for people afraid to risk their own?

376
00:38:48,523 --> 00:38:51,083
Don't clutter up
a clever scheme with morality.

377
00:38:51,159 --> 00:38:53,423
Mmm, so be it...

378
00:38:54,496 --> 00:38:57,488
Knight of the Old Code.

379
00:38:57,532 --> 00:39:01,434
If I wanted my conscience pricked,
I would have stayed with the priest!

380
00:39:01,503 --> 00:39:04,666
Huh! And what does a dragon
know of the Old Code, anyway?

381
00:39:04,706 --> 00:39:06,867
His blade defends the helpless.

382
00:39:06,942 --> 00:39:11,345
His might upholds the weak.
His word speaks only truth.

383
00:39:11,380 --> 00:39:14,178
Shut up! I remember.

384
00:39:14,216 --> 00:39:17,447
That's all it is, a memory.
Nothing can bring it back.

385
00:39:17,519 --> 00:39:20,386
You sound like one who tried.

386
00:39:20,489 --> 00:39:22,389
And failed.

387
00:39:22,491 --> 00:39:26,052
So I no longer try to change the world,
Dragon. I just try to get by in it.

388
00:39:26,128 --> 00:39:29,120
Yes, it's better than death,
I suppose.

389
00:39:29,197 --> 00:39:31,893
Oh, is it? I should think
you'd welcome death.

390
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:36,027
You know, the last of your kind,
all your friends dead,
hunted wherever you go.

391
00:39:38,140 --> 00:39:41,166
Do you delight in reminding me?

392
00:39:41,243 --> 00:39:44,701
Yes, Knight,
I do long for death.

393
00:39:45,981 --> 00:39:48,040
But fear it.

394
00:39:53,588 --> 00:39:57,388
Why? Aside from your misery,
what's to lose?

395
00:39:58,327 --> 00:40:00,261
My soul.

396
00:40:31,359 --> 00:40:33,452
Finish him, Brok!

397
00:40:35,930 --> 00:40:38,364
Well, are you a man?

398
00:40:49,043 --> 00:40:51,773
Should he continue, Mother?

399
00:40:51,813 --> 00:40:58,480
Oh, the field belongs to the apparently
inexhaustible Sir Brok, my son.

400
00:41:21,676 --> 00:41:24,611
The quarry!

401
00:41:26,614 --> 00:41:29,515
First you beg mercy
for your father's fate.

402
00:41:29,617 --> 00:41:31,608
Then you try to avenge it.

403
00:41:32,820 --> 00:41:35,345
Now, you'll share it.

404
00:41:35,423 --> 00:41:38,620
In your kingdom, Einon,
there are worse fates than death.

405
00:41:41,462 --> 00:41:43,487
I'll think one up for you.

406
00:41:44,832 --> 00:41:49,098
- Take her away.
- No! No!

407
00:41:53,107 --> 00:41:55,166
He killed my father!

408
00:41:55,209 --> 00:41:57,700
He killed my father!

409
00:41:59,881 --> 00:42:02,941
He killed my father!

410
00:43:00,375 --> 00:43:02,843
I remember you now.

411
00:43:04,846 --> 00:43:06,871
I remember you.

412
00:43:09,283 --> 00:43:13,549
Your hair, like fire.

413
00:43:17,725 --> 00:43:20,250
You gave me this scar.

414
00:43:22,797 --> 00:43:24,731
Didn't you?

415
00:43:31,806 --> 00:43:35,970
I... owe... you.

416
00:43:50,992 --> 00:43:53,426
I can, uh--

417
00:43:53,494 --> 00:43:55,758
I really can.

418
00:44:03,004 --> 00:44:06,804
Sorry, Bowen.
I hope you like it well done.

419
00:44:12,647 --> 00:44:15,912
You must have hated us very much.

420
00:44:15,983 --> 00:44:18,508
I hated one of you.

421
00:44:18,586 --> 00:44:22,852
These I killed because I wanted
to kill him. But I never found him.

422
00:44:22,957 --> 00:44:26,188
I never will.
If you're the last, he must be dead.

423
00:44:26,260 --> 00:44:28,194
Oh, yes.

424
00:44:28,262 --> 00:44:30,526
Tell me, what was he like...

425
00:44:30,598 --> 00:44:33,089
this, uh, dragon
that you hated?

426
00:44:34,969 --> 00:44:37,802
He only had half a heart.

427
00:44:37,872 --> 00:44:40,363
But even that was enough
to pollute an innocent boy.

428
00:44:40,441 --> 00:44:43,376
Einon was no innocent!
He polluted the heart!

429
00:44:44,879 --> 00:44:46,847
How do you know that?

430
00:44:46,881 --> 00:44:49,111
How do you know that, Dragon?

431
00:44:51,219 --> 00:44:53,881
All dragons know that story.

432
00:44:53,988 --> 00:44:56,479
What was to be their hope
became their doom.

433
00:44:56,557 --> 00:45:00,891
A spoiled, ungrateful child was given
a great gift and destroyed it!

434
00:45:00,962 --> 00:45:06,229
No! I knew Einon.
I was his teacher.

435
00:45:06,334 --> 00:45:09,735
I taught him
the ways of honor, of right.

436
00:45:11,539 --> 00:45:13,530
Then he betrayed you...

437
00:45:13,574 --> 00:45:17,305
just as he betrayed
the dragon whose heart he broke.

438
00:45:17,378 --> 00:45:19,312
That's a lie, Dragon!

439
00:45:19,380 --> 00:45:23,578
Stop calling me "Dragon"!
I have a name.

440
00:45:25,153 --> 00:45:27,713
Well, what is it?

441
00:45:27,755 --> 00:45:30,747
You couldn't possibly pronounce it
in your tongue.

442
00:45:30,825 --> 00:45:34,022
- Try me.
- It's--

443
00:45:51,445 --> 00:45:55,438
Next time stab more flesh,
less cloth.

444
00:45:55,550 --> 00:45:58,041
I'll pierce your heart!

445
00:46:05,359 --> 00:46:07,452
You already did.

446
00:46:11,899 --> 00:46:16,529
A very special heart,
like no other.

447
00:46:16,604 --> 00:46:19,801
A black, withered thing
without pity.

448
00:46:24,412 --> 00:46:26,607
Then teach me.

449
00:46:27,815 --> 00:46:30,249
Pity me.

450
00:46:32,053 --> 00:46:34,146
I'll give you everything.

451
00:46:35,423 --> 00:46:38,119
Even power.

452
00:46:38,159 --> 00:46:41,060
You're so beautiful.

453
00:46:49,070 --> 00:46:51,732
Even power.

454
00:46:52,573 --> 00:46:55,064
Even a throne.

455
00:47:16,097 --> 00:47:18,031
Oh, dear.

456
00:47:18,099 --> 00:47:20,966
Thank you.
It's passed now.

457
00:47:21,035 --> 00:47:23,299
What was it?

458
00:47:23,371 --> 00:47:26,636
An old complaint
that acts up now and again.

459
00:47:28,776 --> 00:47:33,213
Forgive me if anything
I said, if I upset you.

460
00:47:33,314 --> 00:47:36,340
It wasn't you, not you.

461
00:48:11,419 --> 00:48:13,319
Don't be afraid.

462
00:48:13,387 --> 00:48:16,982
I won't let you suffer
the same fate as me.

463
00:48:17,058 --> 00:48:19,083
I've come to help you.

464
00:48:25,499 --> 00:48:28,764
This will bring you out
well below the castle walls.

465
00:48:43,884 --> 00:48:46,114
Thank--

466
00:48:50,558 --> 00:48:52,458
You.

467
00:48:59,699 --> 00:49:02,259
Have you been watching over me
all night?

468
00:49:02,335 --> 00:49:05,702
I've been thinking.

469
00:49:05,772 --> 00:49:08,707
Yes? About what?

470
00:49:08,808 --> 00:49:13,211
Many things.
Mostly about what to call you.

471
00:49:13,313 --> 00:49:15,372
I think I've found you a name.

472
00:49:15,482 --> 00:49:18,883
You say that as though you reached up
and plucked it from the sky.

473
00:49:18,985 --> 00:49:21,510
I did.

474
00:49:21,554 --> 00:49:23,886
Up there.

475
00:49:23,990 --> 00:49:26,220
Do you see that group of stars?

476
00:49:27,327 --> 00:49:30,558
I know those stars very well.

477
00:49:30,663 --> 00:49:34,155
- Do you see the shape that they make?
- Mm-hmm, a dragon.

478
00:49:34,234 --> 00:49:36,168
Yes.

479
00:49:36,302 --> 00:49:38,429
They call it "Draco."

480
00:49:38,538 --> 00:49:42,133
It means "dragon"
in the scholars' speech.

481
00:49:42,242 --> 00:49:44,802
So instead of calling me
"Dragon" in your tongue...

482
00:49:44,911 --> 00:49:47,402
you'll call me "Dragon"
in some other tongue.

483
00:49:47,447 --> 00:49:50,245
You're right.
It's silly.

484
00:49:50,316 --> 00:49:54,912
No. No, I would be honored
to be named after those stars.

485
00:49:54,988 --> 00:49:57,821
I-- I truly would.

486
00:49:59,225 --> 00:50:01,125
Thank you, Bowen.

487
00:50:02,262 --> 00:50:04,162
Draco.

488
00:50:09,769 --> 00:50:13,762
Throw off the yoke
of Einon's oppression!

489
00:50:13,807 --> 00:50:16,970
We must start to fight back!

490
00:50:17,076 --> 00:50:20,273
Your father sang that sour tune once,
and we did fight back.

491
00:50:20,313 --> 00:50:22,645
And once was enough!
We'll not dance to it again!

492
00:50:22,749 --> 00:50:25,240
No, Hewe, just cringe
like a dog under Einon's boot.

493
00:50:25,318 --> 00:50:27,650
At least a cringing dog's
a live one!

494
00:50:27,687 --> 00:50:30,952
Hey! Why waste good food
on bad rhetoric?

495
00:50:32,091 --> 00:50:34,082
I speak the truth.

496
00:50:34,160 --> 00:50:38,028
Truth?
It's rarely inspiring, lass.

497
00:50:38,131 --> 00:50:40,258
And it never wins rebellions...

498
00:50:40,333 --> 00:50:44,326
but it will stretch necks,
if there is a neck...

499
00:50:44,437 --> 00:50:47,167
underneath that little mud pie.

500
00:50:54,514 --> 00:50:57,779
Ready or not, here I come!

501
00:50:58,852 --> 00:51:00,649
Dragon!

502
00:51:07,327 --> 00:51:09,955
It's Draco!

503
00:51:10,029 --> 00:51:11,963
About time.

504
00:51:18,671 --> 00:51:20,571
Mmm!

505
00:51:20,673 --> 00:51:24,040
It seems you people
are in need of a dragonslayer.

506
00:51:25,645 --> 00:51:28,375
Where is the lord responsible
for this village?

507
00:51:29,983 --> 00:51:32,383
Brok lives in a big house
about six miles away.

508
00:51:32,485 --> 00:51:35,852
But he'll only blame any damage on us
and pluck our pockets to pay for it.

509
00:51:35,922 --> 00:51:39,824
I won't pluck them as deeply.
I'll make you a fair offer.

510
00:51:39,893 --> 00:51:42,327
Take it, or leave him!

511
00:51:52,872 --> 00:51:56,239
It's enough you people
grovel to Einon.

512
00:51:56,342 --> 00:51:59,334
Will you be bullied by some broken-down,
blackmailing knight as well?

513
00:51:59,412 --> 00:52:03,007
That's right, you don't need me.

514
00:52:03,082 --> 00:52:05,016
Settle it yourself.

515
00:52:05,084 --> 00:52:07,518
Of course, there are other ways.

516
00:52:07,587 --> 00:52:09,851
Perhaps you'll part with...

517
00:52:09,923 --> 00:52:12,915
one of your precious daughters,
instead of gold.

518
00:52:18,431 --> 00:52:23,300
Dragons are partial
to maiden sacrifices, I hear.
