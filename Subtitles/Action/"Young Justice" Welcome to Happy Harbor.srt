1
00:00:10,555 --> 00:00:11,522
- [grunts]

2
00:00:11,589 --> 00:00:12,523
[whoosh]

3
00:00:12,590 --> 00:00:14,958
Ohh!

4
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:23,000
- You again!

5
00:00:23,068 --> 00:00:24,968
I'm startin' to get insulted
Green Arrow's

6
00:00:25,036 --> 00:00:28,072
Not messin' up
my operations personally.

7
00:00:34,846 --> 00:00:37,614
Uhh!

8
00:00:37,682 --> 00:00:41,018
Do you know what I pay
for a suit in my size?!

9
00:00:41,086 --> 00:00:43,253
Scorch the Earth, boys.

10
00:00:43,321 --> 00:00:44,721
- Uhh!
- Unh!

11
00:00:44,789 --> 00:00:47,157
- Ohh!
- [laughs]

12
00:00:50,962 --> 00:00:53,363
- [grunts]

13
00:01:00,805 --> 00:01:01,738
- Hyah!

14
00:01:01,806 --> 00:01:03,273
- [coughs]

15
00:01:03,341 --> 00:01:04,608
- The cave is perfect.

16
00:01:04,676 --> 00:01:06,944
It has everything
the team will need.

17
00:01:07,011 --> 00:01:09,279
- For covert missions,
you know, spy stuff.

18
00:01:09,347 --> 00:01:11,548
- And wait till you see Superboy
and Miss Martian.

19
00:01:11,616 --> 00:01:12,816
But I saw her first.

20
00:01:12,884 --> 00:01:15,686
- [grunts]

21
00:01:16,754 --> 00:01:17,921
- Hahh!

22
00:01:22,393 --> 00:01:23,594
- Heh heh.

23
00:01:23,661 --> 00:01:27,631
Tell Arrow he shouldn't
send boys to do a man's job.

24
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,702
Go ahead.

25
00:01:34,572 --> 00:01:35,506
[coughs]

26
00:01:35,573 --> 00:01:37,141
[muffled yells]

27
00:01:39,244 --> 00:01:43,113
- High-density
polyurethane foam. Nice.

28
00:01:43,181 --> 00:01:45,649
- So, Speedy, you in?

29
00:01:46,651 --> 00:01:47,851
- Pass.

30
00:01:47,919 --> 00:01:51,088
I'm done letting Arrow and
the League tell me what to do.

31
00:01:51,156 --> 00:01:53,590
I don't need a baby sitter
or a clubhouse

32
00:01:53,658 --> 00:01:55,626
To hang out
with the other kids.

33
00:01:55,693 --> 00:01:57,794
Your Junior Justice League
is a joke,

34
00:01:57,862 --> 00:02:02,199
Something to keep you busy
and in your place.

35
00:02:02,267 --> 00:02:04,334
I don't want any part of it.

36
00:02:32,964 --> 00:02:37,167
- Recognized: Robin, b01;

37
00:02:37,235 --> 00:02:41,538
Kid Flash, b03.

38
00:02:50,615 --> 00:02:52,449
- Did you ask him?
What did he say?

39
00:02:52,517 --> 00:02:54,051
- He's arriving now.

40
00:02:54,118 --> 00:02:56,086
- Then what are we waiting for?

41
00:03:01,826 --> 00:03:04,895
[seabird calls]

44
00:03:19,711 --> 00:03:20,844
- Greetings.

45
00:03:20,912 --> 00:03:23,814
Is there a reason you
intercept me outside the cave?

46
00:03:23,881 --> 00:03:26,049
- We hoped you had
a mission for us.

47
00:03:26,117 --> 00:03:28,852
- Mission assignments are
the Batman's responsibility.

48
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:31,088
- But it's been over a week,
and nothing--

49
00:03:31,155 --> 00:03:32,522
- You'll be tested soon enough.

50
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:35,525
For the time being, simply enjoy
each other's company.

51
00:03:35,593 --> 00:03:37,861
- This team is not
a social club.

52
00:03:37,929 --> 00:03:41,064
- No, but I am told
social interaction

53
00:03:41,132 --> 00:03:43,767
Is an important
team-building exercise.

54
00:03:43,835 --> 00:03:48,972
Perhaps you can keep busy by
familiarizing yourself with the cave.

55
00:03:50,108 --> 00:03:51,174
- "Keep busy."

56
00:03:51,242 --> 00:03:53,043
- Does he think
we're falling for this?

57
00:03:53,111 --> 00:03:54,411
- Oh, I'll find out.

58
00:03:58,349 --> 00:04:01,451
- Recognized: Red Tornado, 1-6.

59
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:03,787
- [sighs] I'm sorry.

60
00:04:03,855 --> 00:04:06,323
I forgot he's a machine,
inorganic.

61
00:04:06,391 --> 00:04:08,692
I cannot read his mind.

62
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:09,926
- Nice try, though.

63
00:04:09,994 --> 00:04:13,297
So, uh, you know what
I'm thinkin' right now?

64
00:04:13,364 --> 00:04:15,432
- We all know
what you're thinkin' now.

65
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:16,667
- Ow.

66
00:04:17,869 --> 00:04:20,570
- And now we tour the clubhouse.

67
00:04:20,638 --> 00:04:22,572
- Well, Superboy and I
live here.

68
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:24,174
We can play tour guides.

69
00:04:24,242 --> 00:04:25,475
- Don't look at me.

70
00:04:25,543 --> 00:04:28,612
- We won't. A private tour
sounds much more fun.

71
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:30,380
- Sh-she never said private.

72
00:04:30,448 --> 00:04:33,450
- Team building. We'll all go.

73
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:36,453
- Unh!

74
00:04:36,521 --> 00:04:39,456
- So this would be
our front door...

75
00:04:39,524 --> 00:04:41,491
And this would be the back.

76
00:04:41,559 --> 00:04:44,127
The cave is actually
the entire mountain.

77
00:04:44,195 --> 00:04:45,529
- It was hollowed out
and reinforced

78
00:04:45,596 --> 00:04:48,298
By Superman and Green Lantern
in the early days of the League.

79
00:04:48,366 --> 00:04:51,201
- Then why abandon it
for the hall of justice?

80
00:04:51,269 --> 00:04:54,137
- The cave's secret location
was compromised.

81
00:04:54,205 --> 00:04:57,140
- So they traded it in
for a tourist trap?

82
00:04:57,208 --> 00:04:58,475
Yeah. That makes sense.

83
00:04:58,543 --> 00:05:00,477
- If villains know of the cave,

84
00:05:00,545 --> 00:05:02,045
We must be on constant alert.

85
00:05:02,113 --> 00:05:04,848
- The bad guys know we know
they know about the place,

86
00:05:04,916 --> 00:05:06,416
So they'd never think
to look here.

87
00:05:06,484 --> 00:05:09,086
- Uh, he means
we're hiding in plain sight.

88
00:05:09,153 --> 00:05:11,154
- Ah, that's much clearer.

89
00:05:11,222 --> 00:05:12,456
- [sniffs]

90
00:05:12,523 --> 00:05:13,590
I smell smoke.

91
00:05:13,658 --> 00:05:15,859
- [gasps] My cookies!

92
00:05:26,003 --> 00:05:29,439
I was trying out grammy Jones
recipe from episode 17 of--

93
00:05:29,507 --> 00:05:30,374
Heh. Never mind.

94
00:05:30,441 --> 00:05:32,342
- I bet they'd have
tasted great.

95
00:05:32,410 --> 00:05:34,111
He doesn't seem to mind.

96
00:05:34,178 --> 00:05:36,046
- [crunching]

97
00:05:36,114 --> 00:05:39,182
I have a serious metabolism.

98
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:41,618
- I'll make more?

99
00:05:41,686 --> 00:05:43,787
- It was sweet of you
to make any.

100
00:05:43,855 --> 00:05:44,721
- Thanks, Aqualad.

101
00:05:44,789 --> 00:05:46,056
- We're off duty.

102
00:05:46,124 --> 00:05:47,124
Call me Kaldur'ahm.

103
00:05:47,191 --> 00:05:49,826
Actually, my friends
call me Kaldur.

104
00:05:49,894 --> 00:05:53,663
- I'm Wally. See? I already
trust you with my secret I.D.,

105
00:05:53,731 --> 00:05:55,899
Unlike Mr. Dark Glasses
over here.

106
00:05:55,967 --> 00:05:59,336
Batman's forbidden Boy Wonder
from telling anyone his real name.

107
00:05:59,404 --> 00:06:00,704
- Mine's no secret.

108
00:06:00,772 --> 00:06:02,439
It's M'gann M'orzz.

109
00:06:02,507 --> 00:06:04,307
Like, you can call me Megan.

110
00:06:04,375 --> 00:06:07,677
It's an Earth name,
and I'm on Earth now.

111
00:06:09,414 --> 00:06:10,647
[telepathic]
Don't worry, Superboy.

112
00:06:10,715 --> 00:06:12,682
- [grunts]

113
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:15,085
- We'll find you
an Earth name, too.

114
00:06:15,153 --> 00:06:17,087
- Get out of my head!

115
00:06:18,089 --> 00:06:20,290
- What's wrong?
I don't understand.

116
00:06:20,358 --> 00:06:22,993
Everyone on Mars
communicates telepathically.

117
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:24,828
- M'gann, stop.

118
00:06:26,063 --> 00:06:28,131
Things are different on Earth.

119
00:06:28,199 --> 00:06:31,067
Here, your powers are
an extreme invasion of privacy.

120
00:06:31,135 --> 00:06:33,336
- Besides, cadmus' creepy
little psychic genomes

121
00:06:33,404 --> 00:06:35,605
Left a bad taste in his brain.

122
00:06:35,673 --> 00:06:37,107
- I--I didn't mean to--

123
00:06:37,175 --> 00:06:40,043
- Just stay out.

124
00:06:44,348 --> 00:06:45,315
- Hello, Megan.

125
00:06:45,383 --> 00:06:47,551
I know what we can do.

126
00:06:55,293 --> 00:06:57,427
Superboy, please.

127
00:06:57,495 --> 00:06:59,296
- Don't talk to me.

128
00:07:10,741 --> 00:07:12,909
- It's my martian bioship.

129
00:07:16,948 --> 00:07:17,881
- Cute.

130
00:07:17,949 --> 00:07:20,116
Not aerodynamic, but cute.

131
00:07:20,184 --> 00:07:22,352
- It's at rest, silly.

132
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:23,653
I'll wake it.

133
00:07:33,531 --> 00:07:35,732
Well, are you coming?

134
00:07:41,606 --> 00:07:43,740
Strap in for launch.

135
00:07:43,808 --> 00:07:46,142
- Whoa.

136
00:07:46,210 --> 00:07:48,011
- Cool.

137
00:07:48,079 --> 00:07:51,681
- Red Tornado,
please open the bay doors.

138
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:04,694
- Incredible.

139
00:08:04,762 --> 00:08:07,197
- [sighs] She sure is.

140
00:08:07,265 --> 00:08:08,532
I--I mean the ship,

141
00:08:08,599 --> 00:08:10,867
Which, like all ships, is a she.

142
00:08:10,935 --> 00:08:13,703
- Fast with his feet,
not so much with his mouth.

143
00:08:13,771 --> 00:08:15,505
- Dude!

144
00:08:15,573 --> 00:08:17,407
- I may not have psychic powers,

145
00:08:17,475 --> 00:08:19,709
But I can guess
what you're thinking.

146
00:08:19,777 --> 00:08:22,746
You overreacted, and you
don't know how to apologize.

147
00:08:22,813 --> 00:08:24,748
Just say sorry.

148
00:08:28,819 --> 00:08:29,786
- He'll come around.

149
00:08:29,854 --> 00:08:32,155
- He doesn't seem
to like me much.

150
00:08:32,223 --> 00:08:35,592
- You guys remember he
has super hearing, right?

151
00:08:37,762 --> 00:08:40,897
- Hey, how 'bout showing us
a little martian shape-shifting?

152
00:08:49,707 --> 00:08:52,208
- Is it wrong
that I think I'm hot?

153
00:08:52,276 --> 00:08:53,610
- Impressive,

154
00:08:53,678 --> 00:08:57,314
But you know you're not exactly
gonna fool anyone with those.

155
00:08:57,381 --> 00:09:00,016
- Mimicking boys
is a lot harder.

156
00:09:00,084 --> 00:09:01,651
- And your clothes?

157
00:09:01,719 --> 00:09:03,587
- They're organic,
like the ship.

158
00:09:03,654 --> 00:09:05,789
They respond
to my mental commands.

159
00:09:05,856 --> 00:09:08,358
- As long as they're
the only ones.

160
00:09:08,426 --> 00:09:12,095
- Can you do that ghosting through
walls thing that manhunter does?

161
00:09:12,163 --> 00:09:14,364
- Density shifting?

162
00:09:14,432 --> 00:09:17,601
No. I-it's a very
advanced technique.

163
00:09:17,668 --> 00:09:20,604
- Flash can vibrate his
molecules right through a wall.

164
00:09:20,671 --> 00:09:23,540
Heh heh heh. When he tries it,
bloody nose.

165
00:09:23,608 --> 00:09:24,674
- Dude!

166
00:09:24,742 --> 00:09:26,643
- Here's something I can do.

167
00:09:28,212 --> 00:09:30,814
Camouflage mode.

168
00:09:30,881 --> 00:09:32,482
- Red Tornado to Miss Martian.

169
00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:34,451
An emergency alert
has been triggered

170
00:09:34,518 --> 00:09:36,386
At the Happy Harbor power plant.

171
00:09:36,454 --> 00:09:39,022
I suggest
you investigate covertly.

172
00:09:39,090 --> 00:09:40,790
I'm sending coordinates.

173
00:09:40,858 --> 00:09:43,193
- Received. Adjusting course.

174
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:45,795
- [scoffs] Tornado's
keeping us busy again.

175
00:09:45,863 --> 00:09:48,765
- Well, a simple fire
led you to Superboy.

176
00:09:48,833 --> 00:09:51,635
We should find out
what caused the alert.

177
00:09:51,702 --> 00:09:53,937
- I think I know the cause.

178
00:10:07,451 --> 00:10:10,019
[all grunt]

179
00:10:21,131 --> 00:10:23,732
[workers yelling]

180
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:27,136
- Robin, are tornadoes
common to New England?

181
00:10:27,204 --> 00:10:28,137
Robin?

182
00:10:28,205 --> 00:10:29,672
[Robin laughs]

183
00:10:29,739 --> 00:10:31,941
- He was just here.

184
00:10:36,613 --> 00:10:38,380
- Unh!

185
00:10:41,151 --> 00:10:42,451
- Who's your new friend?

186
00:10:42,519 --> 00:10:45,788
- Didn't catch his name,
but he plays kinda rough.

187
00:10:46,890 --> 00:10:49,258
- My apologies.

188
00:10:49,326 --> 00:10:52,261
You may address me
as Mr. Twister.

189
00:10:57,100 --> 00:10:58,801
- Uhh! Whoa!

190
00:11:16,119 --> 00:11:17,253
- Whaah!

191
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:19,288
Uhh! Unh!

192
00:11:21,091 --> 00:11:22,391
[both yell]

193
00:11:25,629 --> 00:11:28,697
- I was prepared to be
challenged by a superhero.

194
00:11:28,765 --> 00:11:31,367
I was not, however,
expecting children.

195
00:11:31,434 --> 00:11:34,436
- We're not children!

196
00:11:37,374 --> 00:11:39,842
- Objectively, you are.

197
00:11:39,910 --> 00:11:41,977
Have you no adult supervision?

198
00:11:42,045 --> 00:11:46,282
I find your presence here
quite disturbing.

199
00:11:46,349 --> 00:11:48,184
- Well, we hate
to see you disturbed.

200
00:11:48,251 --> 00:11:52,087
Let's see if you're more turbed
once we kick your can.

201
00:11:55,692 --> 00:11:56,926
- Yaah!

202
00:12:06,403 --> 00:12:08,571
[both yelling]

203
00:12:10,574 --> 00:12:11,974
- Indeed.

204
00:12:12,042 --> 00:12:14,143
That was quite turbing.

205
00:12:14,211 --> 00:12:15,678
Thank you.

206
00:12:15,745 --> 00:12:16,912
[all groan]

207
00:12:24,955 --> 00:12:26,322
- What have you done to my team?

208
00:12:26,389 --> 00:12:29,358
- Embarrassed them, largely.

209
00:12:29,426 --> 00:12:30,593
- Ahh!

210
00:12:33,730 --> 00:12:35,464
- I got you, Wally.

211
00:12:35,532 --> 00:12:38,000
- Ohh. Thanks.

212
00:12:38,068 --> 00:12:41,737
- I would have thought you had all
learned your limitations by now.

213
00:12:41,805 --> 00:12:43,672
- What do you want?!

214
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:45,341
- Isn't it obvious?

215
00:12:45,408 --> 00:12:48,177
I'm waiting for a real hero.

216
00:12:48,245 --> 00:12:49,912
- Read his mind.
Find a weakness.

217
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:52,381
- I thought I wasn't
supposed to do that.

218
00:12:52,449 --> 00:12:54,450
- It's ok with the bad guys.

219
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:59,722
- Nothing. I'm getting nothing.

220
00:12:59,789 --> 00:13:01,390
Hello, Megan.

221
00:13:01,458 --> 00:13:04,493
Mr. Twister is Red Tornado
in disguise.

222
00:13:04,561 --> 00:13:07,162
He's inorganic, an android.

223
00:13:07,230 --> 00:13:10,833
And how many androids do you
know that can generate tornados?

224
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:13,102
- Red Tornado sent us here.

225
00:13:13,169 --> 00:13:15,337
- After saying we'd be tested
soon enough.

226
00:13:15,405 --> 00:13:18,207
This is his test,
something to keep us busy.

227
00:13:18,275 --> 00:13:20,242
- Speedy called it.
We're a joke.

228
00:13:20,310 --> 00:13:21,910
- Unh!

229
00:13:22,779 --> 00:13:26,248
- This game, so over.

230
00:13:28,618 --> 00:13:31,453
- We know who you are
and what you want.

231
00:13:31,521 --> 00:13:33,122
- So let's end this.

232
00:13:33,189 --> 00:13:35,324
- Consider it ended.

233
00:13:40,530 --> 00:13:42,031
- An impressive show,

234
00:13:42,098 --> 00:13:44,066
But we will not indulge you.

235
00:13:44,134 --> 00:13:46,001
We will not engage.

236
00:13:47,971 --> 00:13:51,006
- Uh, can Red Tornado do that?

237
00:13:51,074 --> 00:13:54,243
- You think I'm Tornado? Ironic.

238
00:13:54,311 --> 00:13:56,312
[all yell]

239
00:14:04,487 --> 00:14:07,189
- Aah!

240
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:21,054
- [groans]

241
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:33,467
- Fine, then.

242
00:14:33,534 --> 00:14:35,869
I won't deny
you children have power,

243
00:14:35,937 --> 00:14:38,138
But playing hide-and-seek
with you

244
00:14:38,206 --> 00:14:39,806
Would not help me
achieve my objectives,

245
00:14:39,874 --> 00:14:41,808
So stay concealed.

246
00:14:41,876 --> 00:14:46,680
If you confront me again,
I will show no mercy.

247
00:14:52,887 --> 00:14:53,954
- What happened?

248
00:14:54,021 --> 00:14:56,022
- I placed the bioship
between us.

249
00:14:56,090 --> 00:14:57,090
- Unh! Unh!

250
00:14:57,158 --> 00:14:59,059
And that's supposed
to make it right?

251
00:14:59,127 --> 00:15:01,962
You tricked us into thinking
Twister was Red Tornado.

252
00:15:02,029 --> 00:15:04,030
- She didn't do it on purpose.

253
00:15:04,098 --> 00:15:05,632
- I-it was a rookie mistake.

254
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:07,067
We shouldn't have listened.

255
00:15:07,135 --> 00:15:08,535
- You are pretty inexperienced.

256
00:15:08,603 --> 00:15:10,303
Hit the showers.

257
00:15:10,371 --> 00:15:12,072
We'll take it from here.

258
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:14,174
- Stay out of our way.

259
00:15:21,048 --> 00:15:24,718
- I was just trying
to be part of the team.

260
00:15:24,786 --> 00:15:29,356
- To be honest, I'm not sure
we really have a team.

261
00:15:32,627 --> 00:15:34,795
[car alarms blaring]

262
00:15:37,598 --> 00:15:39,766
[people screaming]

263
00:15:48,543 --> 00:15:51,278
- Certainly this will get
the required attention.

264
00:15:51,345 --> 00:15:52,279
- You got ours,

265
00:15:52,346 --> 00:15:54,281
Full and undivided!

266
00:15:56,150 --> 00:15:58,018
- Immaterial and insufficient!

267
00:15:58,085 --> 00:16:02,088
You are a distraction
I can no longer tolerate.

268
00:16:02,156 --> 00:16:04,558
- Hraah!

269
00:16:10,698 --> 00:16:12,632
- The team really
needs your help.

270
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:15,969
- If I intervened,
it would not be to help.

271
00:16:16,037 --> 00:16:18,772
Still, it is an odd coincidence

272
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:21,975
That this Twister
shares my elemental abilities

273
00:16:22,043 --> 00:16:25,345
And my immunity to telepathy.

274
00:16:25,413 --> 00:16:27,781
- Hello, Megan.

275
00:16:34,088 --> 00:16:35,255
- Ahh!

276
00:16:41,462 --> 00:16:43,897
[timer beeps]

277
00:16:43,965 --> 00:16:46,132
[timers beep]

278
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:48,034
- Aah!

279
00:16:49,504 --> 00:16:51,271
- Whoa. Whoa.

280
00:16:51,339 --> 00:16:53,173
Ahh!

281
00:16:58,546 --> 00:17:00,380
Whaah!

282
00:17:06,454 --> 00:17:07,888
- [grunts]

283
00:17:11,659 --> 00:17:13,260
- You brought your utility belt?

284
00:17:13,327 --> 00:17:16,129
- Never leave home without it--
first thing Batman taught me.

285
00:17:16,197 --> 00:17:18,932
- Yeah, right after never
go to the bathroom without it.

286
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,267
- [telepathic] Listen to me...

287
00:17:20,334 --> 00:17:22,202
- Unh!
- All of you.

288
00:17:22,270 --> 00:17:23,603
- What did we tell you?

289
00:17:23,671 --> 00:17:25,772
- I know,
and I know I messed up,

290
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:28,842
But now I'm very clear
on what we need to do.

291
00:17:28,910 --> 00:17:30,076
Please trust me.

292
00:17:31,312 --> 00:17:33,880
- Get back!
Everyone clear the area!

293
00:17:33,948 --> 00:17:36,016
- [panting]

294
00:17:41,389 --> 00:17:43,423
- Hit the showers, boys.

295
00:17:43,491 --> 00:17:45,892
I was hoping
you could handle this.

296
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:47,561
Clearly you cannot.

297
00:17:47,628 --> 00:17:49,563
- But we've got a plan now.

298
00:17:49,630 --> 00:17:52,365
- The subject
is not up for debate.

299
00:17:53,568 --> 00:17:57,103
- I was beginning to believe
you'd never show up.

300
00:17:57,171 --> 00:17:59,105
- I'm here now.

301
00:18:09,650 --> 00:18:12,419
We are evenly matched, Twister.

302
00:18:13,654 --> 00:18:17,123
- No, Tornado, we are not.

303
00:18:28,836 --> 00:18:32,305
Remain still, android.

304
00:18:37,211 --> 00:18:41,047
The reprogramming
won't take long.

305
00:18:42,550 --> 00:18:44,584
- Longer than you might think.

306
00:18:44,652 --> 00:18:46,252
- No.

307
00:19:24,425 --> 00:19:25,525
[groans]

308
00:19:25,593 --> 00:19:28,461
Foul. I--I call foul.

309
00:19:31,632 --> 00:19:33,299
- M'gann, no!

310
00:19:38,572 --> 00:19:41,141
- Don't know how things
are done on Mars,

311
00:19:41,208 --> 00:19:44,077
But on Earth, we don't
execute our captives!

312
00:19:44,145 --> 00:19:46,179
- You said you trust me.

313
00:19:50,551 --> 00:19:53,687
That's why
I couldn't read his mind.

314
00:19:55,322 --> 00:19:57,824
- Cool. Souvenir.

315
00:19:58,859 --> 00:20:00,794
- We should have had
more faith in you.

316
00:20:00,861 --> 00:20:04,030
- Yeah. You rocked this mission.

317
00:20:04,098 --> 00:20:05,031
Get it?

318
00:20:05,099 --> 00:20:06,433
Rocked. Heh.

319
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:07,467
- Ignore him.

320
00:20:07,535 --> 00:20:10,503
We're all just turbed
you're on the team.

321
00:20:11,372 --> 00:20:14,407
- Heh. Thanks. Me, too.

322
00:20:16,077 --> 00:20:18,945
- Heh. Now, brom,
aren't you relieved

323
00:20:19,013 --> 00:20:21,314
I didn't let you
wear the armor?

324
00:20:21,382 --> 00:20:23,483
- Extremely, professor,
but you're not upset?

325
00:20:23,551 --> 00:20:26,553
- I'm convinced our tracking
program was operational

326
00:20:26,620 --> 00:20:29,889
And that the real Tornado
was somewhere in the vicinity.

327
00:20:29,957 --> 00:20:34,260
Besides, you know science
advances in fits and starts.

328
00:20:34,328 --> 00:20:36,663
Even failure can be instructive,

329
00:20:36,731 --> 00:20:40,500
And I'd say we learned
quite a lot today.

330
00:20:41,435 --> 00:20:43,603
[buoy bell ringing]

331
00:20:45,406 --> 00:20:48,942
- It was clearly created
to sabotage or destroy you.

332
00:20:49,009 --> 00:20:49,876
- Agreed.

333
00:20:49,944 --> 00:20:51,678
- Is that why
you wouldn't help us?

334
00:20:51,746 --> 00:20:53,179
- No. This was your battle.

335
00:20:53,247 --> 00:20:57,317
I do not believe it is my role
to solve your problems for you.

336
00:20:57,384 --> 00:20:59,285
Nor should you solve mine
for me.

337
00:20:59,353 --> 00:21:02,355
- But if you're in danger...

338
00:21:02,423 --> 00:21:04,924
- Consider this matter closed.

339
00:21:06,761 --> 00:21:07,961
- Batman, Aquaman, and Flash,

340
00:21:08,028 --> 00:21:10,363
They'd have jumped right in
to fix things.

341
00:21:10,431 --> 00:21:12,866
- Guess if we're gonna have
a baby sitter,

342
00:21:12,933 --> 00:21:15,301
A heartless machine
is exactly what we need.

343
00:21:15,369 --> 00:21:16,302
- Dude! Harsh.

344
00:21:16,370 --> 00:21:17,303
- And inaccurate.

345
00:21:17,371 --> 00:21:18,671
I have a heart,

346
00:21:18,739 --> 00:21:20,373
Carbon-steel alloy.

347
00:21:20,441 --> 00:21:22,709
I also have excellent hearing.

348
00:21:22,777 --> 00:21:24,377
- Heh. Right.

349
00:21:24,445 --> 00:21:28,114
Sorry. I'll strive
to be more accurate.

350
00:21:28,182 --> 00:21:30,016
- And more respectful.

351
00:21:34,722 --> 00:21:38,024
- Speedy was so wrong.
This team thing...

352
00:21:38,092 --> 00:21:40,193
- Might just work out.

353
00:21:44,165 --> 00:21:45,498
- Sorry.
