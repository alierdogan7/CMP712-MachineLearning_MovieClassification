It's been like this
all day.

<i>There you go</i>
<i>There's your change</i>

841
01:02:05,850 --> 01:02:07,750
<i>Can I help you, buddy?</i>

842
01:02:07,852 --> 01:02:09,581
- Oh, my-
<i>- It's Sue Storm!</i>

843
01:02:09,687 --> 01:02:11,917
- It's the Invisible Woman!
<i>- Hey, you're right!</i>

844
01:02:12,022 --> 01:02:15,549
<i>Sue Storm! It</i> is <i>you!</i>
<i>Listen, my kid loves you!</i>

[ Shouting, Chattering ]

846
01:02:22,500 --> 01:02:24,627
I can't believe
I'm doing this again!

847
01:02:38,933 --> 01:02:42,664
All right, I'm here. Let's make this quick.
I got places to go today.

848
01:02:42,770 --> 01:02:45,534
- [ Grumbles ]
- Oh, wait. [ Laughs ] I don't go anywhere.

849
01:02:45,639 --> 01:02:49,803
Johnny, it's imperative that we
stay inside for the foreseeable future.

850
01:02:49,910 --> 01:02:52,504
<i>I know, I know, Reed, but when you</i>
<i>said that last time my brain hurt a week</i>

851
01:02:52,613 --> 01:02:54,672
Johnny, it's too dangerous
for you to be in public.

852
01:02:54,782 --> 01:02:56,579
You've been saying that for years.

853
01:02:56,684 --> 01:02:59,482
What worries me
is that our powers are evolving.

854
01:02:59,587 --> 01:03:03,751
<i>I know I know!
<i>I am so close to flying, guys, I can taste it</i>

855
01:03:03,858 --> 01:03:06,156
- You can't fly.
- Yet.

856
01:03:06,260 --> 01:03:09,821
- Johnny, can you put that napkin out?
- Oh, Jesus.

857
01:03:10,931 --> 01:03:13,525
What's going on?
How you gonna cure us?

858
01:03:13,634 --> 01:03:17,195
I'm gonna build a machine
to re-create the storm.

859
01:03:17,304 --> 01:03:20,740
<i>The cosmic rays will travel</i>
<i>from this generator to this chamber</i>

860
01:03:20,841 --> 01:03:22,741
<i>What, no pop-ups?</i>

861
01:03:22,843 --> 01:03:25,175
<i>If I can reverse the wave signal-</i>

862
01:03:25,279 --> 01:03:28,009
It'll return us back to normal.

863
01:03:28,115 --> 01:03:31,846
- Huh.
<i>- Right But what are the risks?</i>

864
01:03:31,952 --> 01:03:35,046
Even a small miscalculation could
increase our symptoms exponentially.

865
01:03:35,156 --> 01:03:37,784
- [ Metal Crunches ]
- Or perhaps even kill us.

866
01:03:37,892 --> 01:03:40,383
<i>Now, dying- that's bad, right?</i>

867
01:03:40,494 --> 01:03:43,395
<i>I say wejust let sleeping dogs lie, guys</i>

868
01:03:43,497 --> 01:03:46,466
- So, how long till this
contraption's up and runnin'?
- It's hard to say.

869
01:03:46,567 --> 01:03:48,694
- How long, Reed?
- I don't know-

870
01:03:48,802 --> 01:03:50,736
<i>You don't</i> know?

871
01:03:50,838 --> 01:03:52,897
- You don't want this to get worse.
- Worse than <i>that?</i>

872
01:03:53,007 --> 01:03:55,737
<i>Guys, look, we're gonna</i>
<i>be stuck here for a while</i>

873
