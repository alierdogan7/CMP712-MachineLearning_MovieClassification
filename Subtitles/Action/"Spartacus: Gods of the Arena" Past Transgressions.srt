2
00:00:13,975 --> 00:00:17,307
There is but one path.
We kill them all.

3
00:00:29,269 --> 00:00:32,964
I'm your Dominus.
I will have your fucking hearts!

4
00:00:33,084 --> 00:00:34,675
Quintus...

5
00:00:38,433 --> 00:00:40,100
Lucretia!

6
00:00:41,410 --> 00:00:43,403
What would you do?

7
00:00:44,498 --> 00:00:46,466
To hold your wife again?

8
00:00:47,868 --> 00:00:50,270
<i>To feel the warmth</i>
<i>of her skin?</i>

9
00:00:51,973 --> 00:00:53,873
The taste of her lips?

10
00:00:54,279 --> 00:00:56,276
<i>How many men</i>
<i>would you kill?</i>

11
00:01:00,004 --> 00:01:01,615
<i>I left the deed</i>
<i>in Barca's hands.</i>

12
00:01:01,682 --> 00:01:04,050
Now you're free.

13
00:01:04,118 --> 00:01:07,053
We have been betrayed by
the Beast of fucking Carthage.

14
00:01:10,324 --> 00:01:12,525
You are beneath me.

15
00:01:12,593 --> 00:01:13,301
Arghh!

16
00:01:13,421 --> 00:01:15,595
<i>He is a Magistrate!</i>

17
00:01:16,478 --> 00:01:19,799
<i>One can never know who</i>
<i>is plotting violence, can one.</i>

18
00:01:19,867 --> 00:01:22,035
<i>Or when they may</i>
<i>commit the act.</i>

19
00:01:25,073 --> 00:01:26,458
<i>Your wife,</i>
<i>she moves ever closer,</i>

20
00:01:26,578 --> 00:01:28,074
<i>even as we speak.</i>

21
00:01:28,896 --> 00:01:30,830
<i>My word is kept.</i>

22
00:01:30,898 --> 00:01:32,298
They're reunited.

23
00:01:36,503 --> 00:01:39,539
<i>You will become the greatest</i>
<i>Lanistain the republic.</i>

24
00:01:41,994 --> 00:01:45,111
<i>And as such a title we will</i>
<i>climb beyond our station,</i>

25
00:01:45,179 --> 00:01:46,512
<i>beyond Capua,</i>

26
00:01:47,312 --> 00:01:52,095
<i>perhaps to the very steps</i>
<i>of the Senate itself.</i>

27
00:02:07,167 --> 00:02:10,169
The fights are particularly
entertaining today.

28
00:02:10,237 --> 00:02:12,171
You'd enjoy them more
viewed from the pulvinus.

29
00:02:15,409 --> 00:02:16,843
Fucking shit eater.

30
00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:19,779
Let Vettius preen like a woman.

31
00:02:19,847 --> 00:02:21,114
You'll school him
in the ways of men,

32
00:02:21,181 --> 00:02:22,815
when Gannicus
takes to the sands.

33
00:02:22,883 --> 00:02:23,883
Ahh, absent Tullius

34
00:02:23,951 --> 00:02:25,184
and the Magistrate
to bear witness,

35
00:02:25,252 --> 00:02:27,520
<i>what's the fucking purpose?</i>

36
00:02:27,588 --> 00:02:29,088
One man in today's games.

37
00:02:29,156 --> 00:02:30,890
One only, and the seat
sneeding to impress

38
00:02:30,958 --> 00:02:33,326
<i>stand empty</i>
<i>as Vettius' fucking head.</i>

39
00:02:42,836 --> 00:02:43,736
Get up! Get up!

40
00:02:43,804 --> 00:02:46,439
Solonius! What news?

41
00:02:46,507 --> 00:02:48,641
Tullius and the Magistrate were
delayed with pressing business,

42
00:02:48,709 --> 00:02:50,610
but arrive shortly.

43
00:02:50,677 --> 00:02:52,678
As long as
the current match continues...

44
00:02:56,150 --> 00:02:57,283
No.

45
00:02:57,351 --> 00:02:58,551
Get up!

46
00:02:58,619 --> 00:03:00,319
Good day!

47
00:03:00,387 --> 00:03:03,589
Get up, get up you fuck...

48
00:03:16,003 --> 00:03:18,237
Vettius begins the match
without proper instruction?

49
00:03:18,305 --> 00:03:19,672
Proper?

50
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:22,141
<i>Vettius and the word</i>
<i>are of distant relations.</i>

51
00:03:22,209 --> 00:03:24,744
I for one am grateful
to be spared his oratory.

52
00:03:24,812 --> 00:03:26,846
The man's voice
causes skull to ache.

53
00:03:29,683 --> 00:03:31,918
Gannicus takes position!

54
00:03:53,073 --> 00:03:55,475
Now there's
a fucking gladiator!

55
00:04:19,166 --> 00:04:21,167
<i>Take his fucking face off!</i>

56
00:04:28,041 --> 00:04:29,442
Begin!

57
00:05:00,073 --> 00:05:03,943
Is your man ever
of a serious note?

58
00:05:04,011 --> 00:05:05,411
He'd strip naked
and fight with his cock,

59
00:05:05,479 --> 00:05:06,846
<i>as long as he wins.</i>

60
00:05:06,914 --> 00:05:09,515
Gannicus, I love you.

61
00:05:28,602 --> 00:05:30,670
What is he doing Quintus...

62
00:06:14,581 --> 00:06:16,515
Fucking kill him!

63
00:06:19,319 --> 00:06:20,653
No!

64
00:06:20,721 --> 00:06:22,555
<i>Wait just a little while.</i>

65
00:06:23,523 --> 00:06:26,859
Gannicus, do not kill him.

66
00:06:26,927 --> 00:06:30,196
<i>DO NOT KILL HIM.</i>

67
00:06:31,265 --> 00:06:33,532
<i>Noooo!</i>

68
00:06:56,456 --> 00:06:58,858
Now they arrive.

69
00:07:01,161 --> 00:07:03,529
A victory regardless.

70
00:07:03,597 --> 00:07:05,698
Won in dewy morn.

71
00:07:05,766 --> 00:07:06,932
<i>None of the important</i>
<i>matches happen</i>

72
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,169
until after
the midday sun has passed.

73
00:07:10,237 --> 00:07:13,506
Consider yourself fortunate to
have a man in the games at all.

74
00:07:13,573 --> 00:07:15,474
Good Solonius stands
with empty hands.

75
00:07:18,445 --> 00:07:19,879
Come then.

76
00:07:19,946 --> 00:07:22,648
Let us see them
filled with drink.

77
00:07:22,716 --> 00:07:24,784
Tell Doctore to see
Gannicus back to the ludus.

78
00:07:24,851 --> 00:07:27,086
And properly rewarded
for his showing.

79
00:07:28,422 --> 00:07:29,955
Can we not stay
for the rest of the games?

80
00:07:30,023 --> 00:07:31,624
Vettius' men command
the prominent matches.

81
00:07:31,692 --> 00:07:32,658
He has more than enough eyes

82
00:07:32,726 --> 00:07:34,293
to watch him stroke his cock.

83
00:07:34,361 --> 00:07:35,795
I would not add ours
to the sight.

84
00:07:38,098 --> 00:07:40,800
<i>Now you love me, Capua.</i>

85
00:07:43,503 --> 00:07:44,970
Doctore.

86
00:07:49,009 --> 00:07:51,177
Dominus orders Gannicus
returned to the ludus,

87
00:07:51,244 --> 00:07:52,645
and seen to reward.

88
00:07:56,016 --> 00:07:57,249
Perhaps one day
the pretty little bitch

89
00:07:57,317 --> 00:07:59,685
will fight later
in the afternoon.

90
00:07:59,753 --> 00:08:01,787
With the rest of the men.

91
00:08:01,855 --> 00:08:04,623
You and your tiny cock
best pray that day never come.

92
00:08:09,429 --> 00:08:11,931
Save blood for the fucking
sands, Gannicus.

93
00:08:12,899 --> 00:08:14,934
What seized fucking brain,

94
00:08:15,001 --> 00:08:16,769
releasing your swords
in the arena?

95
00:08:17,938 --> 00:08:19,338
I could have killed
the man absent an arm

96
00:08:19,406 --> 00:08:21,707
and both fucking legs.

97
00:08:21,775 --> 00:08:23,075
Hubris.

98
00:08:23,143 --> 00:08:24,677
A fine quality.

99
00:08:24,745 --> 00:08:28,514
Often possessed by cunts
who perish from it.

100
00:08:28,582 --> 00:08:30,216
Ahh!

101
00:08:30,283 --> 00:08:32,451
Did you catch
the manner of his eye,

102
00:08:32,519 --> 00:08:34,954
as he gazed down
from the pulvinus?

103
00:08:35,021 --> 00:08:36,789
Fucking Vettius.

104
00:08:36,857 --> 00:08:38,457
Barely free
of his mother's tit,

105
00:08:38,525 --> 00:08:40,292
yet carries himself
above lanistas

106
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:42,228
of more deserving years.

107
00:08:42,295 --> 00:08:44,530
Youth often imagines
itself swollen beyond its worth.

108
00:08:44,598 --> 00:08:46,499
Time will cure him
of the condition,

109
00:08:46,566 --> 00:08:48,434
as it does all
foolish young men.

110
00:08:48,502 --> 00:08:50,503
Time is what he holds
in abundance.

111
00:08:50,570 --> 00:08:52,505
The new arena will be finished
in but a handful of months.

112
00:08:52,572 --> 00:08:55,374
If we are excluded
from the opening games...

113
00:08:55,442 --> 00:08:57,143
Vettius is but shit
from a shit town.

114
00:08:57,210 --> 00:08:59,278
How could Tullius
and the Magistrate

115
00:08:59,346 --> 00:09:02,047
favor a boy from Nola
over Capua's own sons?

116
00:09:02,115 --> 00:09:03,649
How do they do it now?

117
00:09:03,717 --> 00:09:05,618
We must prove ourselves
in the more important bouts

118
00:09:05,685 --> 00:09:07,920
in the old arena
and secure position.

119
00:09:07,988 --> 00:09:10,556
To fight later in the day we
must first distinguish ourselves

120
00:09:10,624 --> 00:09:11,857
against Vettius' men.

121
00:09:11,925 --> 00:09:14,894
Yet Vettius' men only fight
later in the day.

122
00:09:14,961 --> 00:09:16,429
A vexing conundrum.

123
00:09:16,496 --> 00:09:18,063
Lucretia?!

124
00:09:18,131 --> 00:09:19,932
Gaia!

125
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,133
Gaia!

126
00:09:21,201 --> 00:09:23,536
How come you to Capua
without telling me?

127
00:09:23,603 --> 00:09:25,604
I have only
this moment returned,

128
00:09:25,672 --> 00:09:27,773
<i>with intentions</i>
<i>of seeking you out.</i>

129
00:09:27,841 --> 00:09:30,176
Do you travel
with your husband?

130
00:09:30,243 --> 00:09:32,845
He takes to road no more.

131
00:09:32,913 --> 00:09:34,680
Not in this life, at least.

132
00:09:34,748 --> 00:09:35,781
Apologies.

133
00:09:35,849 --> 00:09:36,782
None required.

134
00:09:36,850 --> 00:09:38,884
It was his time.

135
00:09:40,687 --> 00:09:42,421
Are you occupied?

136
00:09:42,489 --> 00:09:45,224
I am fit to bursting
with stories of my adventures.

137
00:09:46,159 --> 00:09:47,560
Quintus...?

138
00:09:47,627 --> 00:09:49,762
What man dares stand
between women and gossip?

139
00:09:49,830 --> 00:09:51,197
You must tell me everything.

140
00:09:51,264 --> 00:09:53,132
Secret no detail.

141
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,868
Removed from the ears of men,
my lips willingly part...

142
00:09:56,770 --> 00:09:59,138
Gaia returns unencumbered.

143
00:09:59,206 --> 00:10:01,974
And in enticing form.

144
00:10:02,042 --> 00:10:04,877
Huh, that woman is
a force of fucking nature.

145
00:10:04,945 --> 00:10:08,347
One that has blown many an
unsuspecting man to his ruin.

146
00:10:08,415 --> 00:10:10,549
You require someone
more refined to grace armas

147
00:10:10,617 --> 00:10:12,551
our fortunes rise.

148
00:10:15,222 --> 00:10:18,524
Have eyes ever
beheld such a marvel?

149
00:10:18,592 --> 00:10:21,927
A sight to put the Circus
Maximus in Rome to bitter shame.

150
00:10:21,995 --> 00:10:23,195
We will be the ones shamed,

151
00:10:23,263 --> 00:10:26,899
if grand ceremony
passes absent our gladiators.

152
00:10:26,967 --> 00:10:28,100
We must force advantage,

153
00:10:28,168 --> 00:10:30,069
before opportunity
slips from grasp.

154
00:10:30,136 --> 00:10:31,737
No, we must be patient.

155
00:10:31,805 --> 00:10:34,640
Your father would venture forth
with respect and caution.

156
00:10:34,708 --> 00:10:36,509
Then a blessing
he is not present.

157
00:10:36,576 --> 00:10:38,577
Perhaps we should send word
to him in Sicilia,

158
00:10:38,645 --> 00:10:39,778
petition advice...?

159
00:10:39,846 --> 00:10:41,981
I can already
divine content of his reply.

160
00:10:42,048 --> 00:10:44,917
Which is why he never
rose above his humble station.

161
00:10:44,985 --> 00:10:46,552
Fuck patience!

162
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:48,454
Ahh.

163
00:10:48,522 --> 00:10:49,889
Look to Tullius for the way!

164
00:10:49,956 --> 00:10:51,624
He seizes
opportunity by the balls

165
00:10:51,691 --> 00:10:54,793
while lesser men
are left holding cock!

166
00:10:54,861 --> 00:10:57,196
A simple merchant,

167
00:10:57,264 --> 00:10:59,298
yet he gives honored
counsel to the Magistrate

168
00:10:59,366 --> 00:11:02,601
and all the rest of the noble
shit eaters of Capua.

169
00:11:02,669 --> 00:11:05,204
Truth told,
yet at excessive volume.

170
00:11:05,272 --> 00:11:07,640
I would shout his praise
to the fucking heavens.

171
00:11:07,707 --> 00:11:08,841
His hands shaped events

172
00:11:08,909 --> 00:11:12,311
resulting in the erection
of the new arena.

173
00:11:12,379 --> 00:11:14,280
He supplies slaves
from the furthest reaches

174
00:11:14,347 --> 00:11:16,282
of the Republic to speed
its completion.

175
00:11:16,349 --> 00:11:18,717
Through the ambitions
of Tullius,

176
00:11:18,785 --> 00:11:21,253
Capua is elevated.

177
00:11:21,321 --> 00:11:23,856
<i>A lesson to be studied,</i>
<i>and reproduced in kind.</i>

178
00:11:24,357 --> 00:11:26,392
Is that all?

179
00:11:26,459 --> 00:11:28,127
A simple task then, Batiatus.

180
00:11:30,130 --> 00:11:31,564
Dominus.

181
00:11:31,631 --> 00:11:35,067
Between us, we have the greatest
gladiators in Capua.

182
00:11:35,135 --> 00:11:38,437
Barca, Acadeus, Gannicus...

183
00:11:38,505 --> 00:11:41,106
Men forged into something
beyond their worth.

184
00:11:41,174 --> 00:11:43,509
Beyond anything that smug
little piss Vettius

185
00:11:43,577 --> 00:11:45,311
could ever hope to offer...

186
00:11:50,550 --> 00:11:51,717
Perhaps Tullius
should not have strayed

187
00:11:51,785 --> 00:11:54,320
so far abroad
in acquiring his slaves.

188
00:11:55,889 --> 00:11:57,590
Pick him up.

189
00:11:59,459 --> 00:12:00,826
<i>Crixus!</i>

190
00:12:01,828 --> 00:12:03,829
You know the rules.

191
00:12:03,897 --> 00:12:05,731
<i>No one breaks the line!</i>

192
00:12:05,799 --> 00:12:07,199
<i>Hold!</i>

193
00:12:08,435 --> 00:12:09,668
This is one
of good Tullius' slaves?

194
00:12:09,736 --> 00:12:11,036
It is.

195
00:12:11,104 --> 00:12:12,371
I would make purchase.

196
00:12:12,439 --> 00:12:13,505
Purchase?

197
00:12:13,573 --> 00:12:14,607
What's the man's worth?

198
00:12:14,674 --> 00:12:16,342
<i>He is not for sale.</i>

199
00:12:16,409 --> 00:12:18,010
Fifty denarii.

200
00:12:18,078 --> 00:12:19,011
What are you doing?

201
00:12:19,079 --> 00:12:20,279
Seizing balls.

202
00:12:20,347 --> 00:12:22,214
The man is barely worth ten.

203
00:12:22,282 --> 00:12:24,650
<i>Why would you pay such</i>
<i>a sum for a shit Gaul?</i>

204
00:12:24,718 --> 00:12:25,951
Shit?

205
00:12:26,019 --> 00:12:28,153
Do you not see
the promise in his eyes?

206
00:12:28,221 --> 00:12:30,255
<i>The spark smoldering</i>
<i>in his breast?</i>

207
00:12:30,323 --> 00:12:32,725
<i>I would give it tender,</i>
<i>to ignite in the arena!</i>

208
00:12:35,161 --> 00:12:36,862
Fifty?

209
00:12:36,930 --> 00:12:39,765
Add another five
to weight your own purse.

210
00:12:39,833 --> 00:12:40,966
Lend me twenty denarii.

211
00:12:42,769 --> 00:12:43,869
You pay too much for the man.

212
00:12:43,937 --> 00:12:45,571
<i>The man is nothing.</i>

213
00:12:45,639 --> 00:12:47,539
<i>I pay to gain favor</i>
<i>with Tullius.</i>

214
00:12:51,411 --> 00:12:53,379
A waste of coin.

215
00:12:53,446 --> 00:12:55,881
<i>The shit fuck will</i>
<i>never be a gladiator.</i>

216
00:12:55,949 --> 00:12:59,685
<i>Even the lowest man</i>
<i>can rise beyond the heavens,</i>

217
00:12:59,753 --> 00:13:02,421
if tempted
with the proper reward...

218
00:13:23,543 --> 00:13:25,544
Urgh!

219
00:14:12,392 --> 00:14:15,227
He was well satisfied?

220
00:14:15,295 --> 00:14:17,029
Very well.

221
00:14:17,097 --> 00:14:18,831
Dominus will be pleased.

222
00:14:18,898 --> 00:14:20,933
Not as much as I am.

223
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,134
When are you not so?

224
00:14:22,202 --> 00:14:24,203
Especially with yourself?

225
00:14:24,270 --> 00:14:25,671
It is a curse.

226
00:14:25,739 --> 00:14:28,140
Being blessed
with so much to offer.

227
00:14:28,208 --> 00:14:30,576
And so few interested
in sharing it.

228
00:14:36,883 --> 00:14:39,051
See yourselves well scrubbed.

229
00:14:39,119 --> 00:14:41,987
I would not
have you smell of goat.

230
00:14:42,055 --> 00:14:43,255
Goat?

231
00:14:43,323 --> 00:14:44,623
A dead one.

232
00:14:46,793 --> 00:14:49,161
The smell of victory, brother.

233
00:14:49,229 --> 00:14:50,329
Well earned.

234
00:14:50,396 --> 00:14:52,297
The men all speak
of your triumph.

235
00:14:52,365 --> 00:14:54,933
As they will of yours,
when you return to the arena.

236
00:14:55,001 --> 00:14:57,469
The crowd will cum
in great geysers,

237
00:14:57,537 --> 00:15:00,272
drenching the gods
gathered to witness

238
00:15:00,340 --> 00:15:04,810
Oenomaus once more
upon the sands!

239
00:15:04,878 --> 00:15:06,678
I would have words
with my wife.

240
00:15:06,746 --> 00:15:09,748
Absent your cock,
which has escaped you.

241
00:15:11,618 --> 00:15:13,452
It will be missed.

242
00:15:17,123 --> 00:15:19,057
Has Dominus
spoken of my return?

243
00:15:19,125 --> 00:15:20,893
I have not heard it.

244
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:22,928
More than a year has passed
since I faced Theokoles.

245
00:15:22,996 --> 00:15:24,163
Perhaps Dominus
does not intend...

246
00:15:24,230 --> 00:15:26,165
You were the only one
to ever stand against

247
00:15:26,232 --> 00:15:28,300
the Shadow of Death and live.

248
00:15:28,368 --> 00:15:31,336
Batiatus would be a fool
to keep you from the arena.

249
00:15:31,404 --> 00:15:32,437
Or I am the fool,

250
00:15:32,505 --> 00:15:34,306
for ever dreaming
of such a thing.

251
00:15:34,374 --> 00:15:35,674
You are many things.

252
00:15:35,742 --> 00:15:37,109
Foolish is not among them.

253
00:15:37,177 --> 00:15:39,645
Batiatus waits
but for the perfect day

254
00:15:39,712 --> 00:15:42,047
for his champion
to retake glory.

255
00:15:52,759 --> 00:15:53,926
Is it true?

256
00:15:53,993 --> 00:15:56,261
That his thing
is large as a horse's?

257
00:15:56,329 --> 00:15:57,462
Diona!

258
00:15:57,530 --> 00:15:58,931
Are you not curious?

259
00:15:58,998 --> 00:16:00,532
Is Gannicus' really that big?

260
00:16:02,268 --> 00:16:04,770
Where is Domina?

261
00:16:04,838 --> 00:16:06,972
In the triclinium
with her guest.

262
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:08,473
Diona, see the girls bathed.

263
00:16:08,541 --> 00:16:09,942
Yes, Melitta.

264
00:16:12,912 --> 00:16:15,647
It is exciting, speaking
of such things, is it not?

265
00:16:16,816 --> 00:16:19,585
I was of a similar age,
not so long ago.

266
00:16:19,652 --> 00:16:22,187
I know the giddy enticement
of the subject.

267
00:16:22,255 --> 00:16:26,358
<i>Yet you and Diona</i>
<i>should turn thought from it.</i>

268
00:16:26,426 --> 00:16:28,861
Soon enough your flowers
will be plucked.

269
00:16:28,928 --> 00:16:30,696
Hastening the moment
will only result

270
00:16:30,763 --> 00:16:32,397
in bruising of the petals.

271
00:16:33,633 --> 00:16:35,000
Yes, Melitta.

272
00:16:36,469 --> 00:16:39,104
And in regards to Gannicus...

273
00:16:39,172 --> 00:16:40,439
I've seen bigger.

274
00:16:44,210 --> 00:16:47,212
Oh, you don't seem overly
distraught at his passing.

275
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:49,448
How would you present,

276
00:16:49,515 --> 00:16:52,484
after years enduring
withered flesh groping at you.

277
00:16:52,552 --> 00:16:55,354
But when you left Capua
I thought you madly in love.

278
00:16:55,421 --> 00:16:57,956
I was...with his purse.

279
00:16:59,726 --> 00:17:04,296
Sadly his fortunes
went dry towards the end.

280
00:17:04,364 --> 00:17:07,366
And did you aid
in their evaporation?

281
00:17:07,901 --> 00:17:09,835
What can I say?

282
00:17:09,903 --> 00:17:12,004
I am the glorious sun.

283
00:17:14,607 --> 00:17:17,743
Returned to bless
loving rays upon favored friend...

284
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:21,546
Gaia...

285
00:17:21,614 --> 00:17:24,616
I have far too many baubles
brought from Rome.

286
00:17:26,119 --> 00:17:28,420
Along with other
pleasures to be shared...

287
00:17:39,899 --> 00:17:41,500
It suits you.

288
00:17:42,568 --> 00:17:44,836
It would dazzle Venus herself.

289
00:17:47,173 --> 00:17:50,542
I fear I have nothing so
exquisite to give in return.

290
00:17:50,610 --> 00:17:53,612
Your company
is all I ever desire.

291
00:17:55,148 --> 00:17:56,815
And...?

292
00:17:58,051 --> 00:17:59,351
And, I would not
refuse the comforts

293
00:17:59,419 --> 00:18:01,053
of a well appointed villa,

294
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:03,588
until I manage
other arrangements...?

295
00:18:04,424 --> 00:18:06,191
Involving a ripe purse?

296
00:18:08,695 --> 00:18:12,531
So many years have passed,
yet nothing has changed.

297
00:18:12,598 --> 00:18:15,667
Everything has changed,

298
00:18:16,269 --> 00:18:17,536
and for the better,

299
00:18:17,603 --> 00:18:19,137
by the judging of it.

300
00:18:21,007 --> 00:18:22,307
When last we parted,

301
00:18:22,375 --> 00:18:25,477
this house was but a tomb,

302
00:18:25,545 --> 00:18:29,548
haunted by the living specter
of your husband's father.

303
00:18:29,615 --> 00:18:31,750
<i>And you,</i>
<i>forced to smile and cater,</i>

304
00:18:31,818 --> 00:18:35,087
bringing him his honeyed
wine every evening.

305
00:18:35,154 --> 00:18:36,688
I thought the crusty
old bastard

306
00:18:36,756 --> 00:18:38,790
would never succumb
to the afterlife.

307
00:18:38,858 --> 00:18:41,293
He is not yet so far removed.

308
00:18:41,361 --> 00:18:43,962
Merely retired
to Sicilia for his health.

309
00:18:44,030 --> 00:18:46,898
So he yet controls the ludus?

310
00:18:46,966 --> 00:18:47,899
No.

311
00:18:47,967 --> 00:18:50,002
My husband does.

312
00:18:50,069 --> 00:18:51,737
<i>As his proxy.</i>

313
00:18:51,804 --> 00:18:53,572
<i>Was Gannicus</i>
<i>well attended then?</i>

314
00:18:53,639 --> 00:18:55,540
He was, Domina.

315
00:18:55,608 --> 00:18:58,010
Gannicus?

316
00:18:58,077 --> 00:19:04,049
That Celt with the ridiculously
charming smile?

317
00:19:04,117 --> 00:19:05,384
<i>He has risen to prominence</i>
<i>within the ludus</i>

318
00:19:05,451 --> 00:19:08,954
ever since Oenomaus
was injured against Theokoles.

319
00:19:09,022 --> 00:19:12,124
In an amazing
display of bravery.

320
00:19:12,191 --> 00:19:14,026
<i>Gannicus.</i>

321
00:19:14,861 --> 00:19:16,094
<i>Oenomaus.</i>

322
00:19:16,162 --> 00:19:20,298
All the hard, rippling men
right beneath our feet.

323
00:19:20,366 --> 00:19:22,834
One moistens at the thought.

324
00:19:22,902 --> 00:19:24,202
Gaia!

325
00:19:24,270 --> 00:19:25,937
They are but slaves!

326
00:19:26,005 --> 00:19:28,240
<i>Please.</i>

327
00:19:28,307 --> 00:19:30,675
In all the years
you've called this ludus home,

328
00:19:30,743 --> 00:19:32,978
you've never once considered
fucking one of them?

329
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:37,249
The very thought
of that turns stomach.

330
00:19:38,651 --> 00:19:40,886
I would never lay
with any man besides my husband.

331
00:19:41,721 --> 00:19:43,922
Let alone a filthy gladiator.

332
00:19:48,127 --> 00:19:50,429
<i>Fucking Gaul.</i>

333
00:19:50,496 --> 00:19:53,331
Another sacrifice
to the gods of the arena.

334
00:19:54,834 --> 00:19:57,569
Ze'irta kema atteta
mezayyna, hada.

335
00:19:59,605 --> 00:20:01,440
Ah, Dagan thinks you of a form,

336
00:20:01,507 --> 00:20:03,241
giving odds in your favor.

337
00:20:03,309 --> 00:20:05,010
Odds?

338
00:20:05,078 --> 00:20:06,845
Do you know
where you are, friend?

339
00:20:06,913 --> 00:20:08,313
The House of Batiatus.

340
00:20:08,381 --> 00:20:09,981
Trainer of gladiators.

341
00:20:10,049 --> 00:20:11,049
<i>Yes.</i>

342
00:20:11,117 --> 00:20:13,452
You stand among
his latest recruits.

343
00:20:13,519 --> 00:20:15,420
Bound by pain and blood,

344
00:20:15,488 --> 00:20:17,923
together we toil
beneath the cruel sting

345
00:20:17,990 --> 00:20:20,058
of Doctore's whip.

346
00:20:20,126 --> 00:20:22,294
There were eight of us,
when training began.

347
00:20:22,361 --> 00:20:24,296
Now we're but three.

348
00:20:24,363 --> 00:20:26,231
Four.

349
00:20:31,971 --> 00:20:34,673
And how are we so blessed
by a swelling number?

350
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:35,674
Hm?

351
00:20:35,741 --> 00:20:37,375
By what means
do you find yourself

352
00:20:37,443 --> 00:20:39,111
among such storied company?

353
00:20:41,147 --> 00:20:43,181
My own.

354
00:20:44,517 --> 00:20:46,618
You willingly present
ass for fucking?

355
00:20:46,686 --> 00:20:48,286
No,

356
00:20:48,354 --> 00:20:51,490
no, young Indus.

357
00:20:51,557 --> 00:20:54,993
Do you not see it in his eyes?

358
00:20:55,061 --> 00:21:00,065
<i>This is a man with dreams</i>
<i>of blood and glory.</i>

359
00:21:00,133 --> 00:21:02,134
I doubt he'll live
to see the test.

360
00:21:02,201 --> 00:21:03,635
Test?

361
00:21:03,703 --> 00:21:05,137
<i>Our last trial.</i>

362
00:21:05,204 --> 00:21:07,539
We must all face
one of the seasoned men,

363
00:21:07,607 --> 00:21:10,742
and demonstrate to the Dominus
what we have learned.

364
00:21:10,810 --> 00:21:13,979
Live, and receive
the Mark of the Brotherhood,

365
00:21:14,046 --> 00:21:16,882
proving yourself
worthy of the arena.

366
00:21:18,084 --> 00:21:20,552
I will stand upon its sands.

367
00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:22,654
Gammadta mezayyna.

368
00:21:22,722 --> 00:21:25,123
Be-qushya matya maysaeri.

369
00:21:26,826 --> 00:21:28,960
Hm, he longs
to call you brother,

370
00:21:29,028 --> 00:21:31,296
<i>and join you as gladiator.</i>

371
00:21:34,333 --> 00:21:36,468
Tell him the feeling
is well shared.

372
00:21:38,804 --> 00:21:40,238
<i>Oh, Jupiter's cock!</i>

373
00:21:42,508 --> 00:21:46,478
Fifty denarii,
for a fucking stone hauler.

374
00:21:47,513 --> 00:21:49,948
Coin well spent.

375
00:21:50,016 --> 00:21:51,550
Was it?

376
00:21:53,152 --> 00:21:54,319
Word surly
has reached Tullius' ear,

377
00:21:54,387 --> 00:21:56,154
yet none of gratitude return.

378
00:21:57,857 --> 00:22:00,125
Fifty denarii!

379
00:22:00,193 --> 00:22:01,293
Solonius was right.

380
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:03,962
I should temper patience,
as my father would.

381
00:22:04,030 --> 00:22:07,165
You're not your father.

382
00:22:07,233 --> 00:22:08,733
Nor would I have it so.

383
00:22:11,237 --> 00:22:14,172
Perhaps tomorrow you will
find yourself in the market.

384
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:16,007
Where you have often
mentioned Tullius

385
00:22:16,075 --> 00:22:18,310
frequents upon a certain hour,

386
00:22:18,377 --> 00:22:20,679
overseeing his concerns.

387
00:22:20,746 --> 00:22:22,480
A chance encounter,
to gauge reaction?

388
00:22:22,548 --> 00:22:25,483
Certain to be favorable.

389
00:22:25,551 --> 00:22:28,553
As I know your reply
to my request will be.

390
00:22:30,389 --> 00:22:32,991
Give it voice,
and see it considered.

391
00:22:33,059 --> 00:22:35,694
I would have Gaia
remain with us.

392
00:22:35,761 --> 00:22:37,395
Just for a few days,

393
00:22:37,463 --> 00:22:39,364
until she can manage
other arrangements.

394
00:22:39,432 --> 00:22:41,499
The request does not surprise.

395
00:22:41,567 --> 00:22:43,168
Is that a yes?

396
00:22:43,236 --> 00:22:44,202
Ask for the moon,

397
00:22:44,270 --> 00:22:46,838
and I would wrest it
from the heavens.

398
00:22:46,906 --> 00:22:50,208
Gaia will be so pleased
at your answer.

399
00:22:50,276 --> 00:22:53,612
Let her keep company
with her wine a moment longer...

400
00:22:57,516 --> 00:23:00,986
Has a wife ever
had such a husband?

401
00:23:01,787 --> 00:23:03,421
He but honors her...

402
00:23:03,489 --> 00:23:06,524
and the gods for guiding her
to his arms...

403
00:24:06,952 --> 00:24:11,122
Crixus, you lower
shield when you thrust.

404
00:24:11,190 --> 00:24:15,126
See it raised, or your fucking
brains on the sand.

405
00:24:15,194 --> 00:24:15,894
Yes, Doctore.

406
00:24:17,630 --> 00:24:19,397
A lucky blow.

407
00:24:20,066 --> 00:24:21,232
A blow well struck.

408
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:23,068
I will not make
the same mistake.

409
00:24:28,974 --> 00:24:30,008
Good!

410
00:24:30,076 --> 00:24:31,309
Again!

411
00:24:37,917 --> 00:24:39,684
Doctore!

412
00:24:40,419 --> 00:24:42,020
I would work the palus.

413
00:24:42,088 --> 00:24:43,455
In the shade.

414
00:24:46,525 --> 00:24:48,460
I would not let gaze linger.

415
00:24:48,527 --> 00:24:49,561
Gannicus is a fucking fool,

416
00:24:49,628 --> 00:24:51,629
yet one of deadly skill.

417
00:24:51,697 --> 00:24:53,131
He is often rewarded
for his victories

418
00:24:53,199 --> 00:24:54,966
with wine and cunt.

419
00:24:55,034 --> 00:24:56,401
Gain Dominus' favor,

420
00:24:56,469 --> 00:24:58,036
and such delights
could be yours.

421
00:25:02,208 --> 00:25:05,410
Drink and women
are not my concern.

422
00:25:05,478 --> 00:25:07,145
Ah, more for me then.

423
00:25:09,815 --> 00:25:12,584
Fucking recruits.

424
00:25:12,651 --> 00:25:14,552
<i>Smaller and smaller</i>
<i>each year.</i>

425
00:25:18,691 --> 00:25:20,325
Apologies.

426
00:25:28,334 --> 00:25:30,335
<i>Oenomaus.</i>

427
00:25:30,403 --> 00:25:32,170
You return to form.

428
00:25:34,039 --> 00:25:35,774
Pair with Crixus,
and bring him to speed.

429
00:25:38,978 --> 00:25:40,245
Dominus.

430
00:25:51,390 --> 00:25:53,391
Gratitude.

431
00:25:53,459 --> 00:25:54,659
For your instructions...

432
00:25:58,097 --> 00:26:01,332
Lesson one: never drop
your fucking guard.

433
00:26:05,504 --> 00:26:06,905
Do you lay eyes?

434
00:26:06,972 --> 00:26:09,073
No. Perhaps Tullius
did not come today.

435
00:26:09,141 --> 00:26:10,208
He always arrives,

436
00:26:10,276 --> 00:26:12,410
and seldom departs
before noonday sun.

437
00:26:12,478 --> 00:26:14,612
Are you his shadow now,
adhered to each footstep?

438
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:15,980
I but study my subject,

439
00:26:16,048 --> 00:26:18,249
as any proper student
would in pursuit of knowledge.

440
00:26:19,685 --> 00:26:20,885
Tullius' man.

441
00:26:22,655 --> 00:26:23,788
I seek your master,
good Tullius.

442
00:26:23,856 --> 00:26:24,789
Would he be within?

443
00:26:24,857 --> 00:26:26,291
Oh...

444
00:26:27,259 --> 00:26:28,860
I wish to express my gratitude

445
00:26:28,928 --> 00:26:32,230
for allowing me to purchase
his slave Crixus.

446
00:26:32,298 --> 00:26:34,265
The Gaul shows great promise
towards the arena.

447
00:26:36,302 --> 00:26:38,870
Perhaps you could
pass word of my presence...

448
00:26:43,909 --> 00:26:46,311
You owe me a few of those,
if you recall.

449
00:26:46,378 --> 00:26:49,414
A costly enterprise,
for us both.

450
00:26:49,482 --> 00:26:51,216
That one prays
will turn profit.

451
00:26:53,486 --> 00:26:55,687
Good Batiatus.

452
00:26:55,754 --> 00:26:57,422
The gods answer...

453
00:26:59,892 --> 00:27:01,926
In mocking tone.

454
00:27:01,994 --> 00:27:03,661
<i>I hoped for occasion</i>
<i>to give gratitude</i>

455
00:27:03,729 --> 00:27:05,997
for relieving me
of that troublesome Gaul.

456
00:27:06,065 --> 00:27:07,332
Think nothing of it.

457
00:27:07,399 --> 00:27:09,467
A gesture of respect,
for a man deserving of it.

458
00:27:09,535 --> 00:27:11,302
Received with all intentions.

459
00:27:11,370 --> 00:27:13,271
Yet I fear you have overpaid.

460
00:27:13,339 --> 00:27:17,008
A common mistake, for those
with no head towards business.

461
00:27:18,477 --> 00:27:21,946
Fifty denarii, minus the ten
of the Gaul's actual worth.

462
00:27:22,014 --> 00:27:23,915
Well uh...

463
00:27:23,983 --> 00:27:25,517
I do not ask for its return.

464
00:27:25,584 --> 00:27:26,784
Fair bargain was struck.

465
00:27:26,852 --> 00:27:28,086
Fair?

466
00:27:28,153 --> 00:27:29,287
A clumsy maneuver to
gain position

467
00:27:29,355 --> 00:27:30,722
for your ill-trained men.

468
00:27:30,789 --> 00:27:31,723
Vettius.

469
00:27:31,790 --> 00:27:33,191
Ill-trained?

470
00:27:33,259 --> 00:27:35,493
Any one of my men could
best yours fucking blindfolded,

471
00:27:35,561 --> 00:27:36,861
you pissy little shit.

472
00:27:36,929 --> 00:27:38,496
Listen how the rooster crows.

473
00:27:38,564 --> 00:27:39,497
Let us calm ourselves...

474
00:27:39,565 --> 00:27:40,498
You doubt my words?

475
00:27:40,566 --> 00:27:42,333
Test them.

476
00:27:42,401 --> 00:27:44,269
<i>Request the match</i>
<i>in next month's games.</i>

477
00:27:44,336 --> 00:27:45,503
Why delay?

478
00:27:45,571 --> 00:27:47,038
Let us see it here
in the morning,

479
00:27:47,106 --> 00:27:49,741
<i>the people to judge</i>
<i>who holds the better man.</i>

480
00:27:49,808 --> 00:27:51,009
In the market?

481
00:27:51,076 --> 00:27:52,043
Surely the Magistrate

482
00:27:52,111 --> 00:27:54,412
would not approve
such disruption.

483
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:56,447
Good Tullius has his ear.

484
00:27:56,515 --> 00:27:58,383
The Magistrate could
be swayed to allow it...

485
00:27:58,450 --> 00:28:00,752
if that is what you wish?

486
00:28:00,819 --> 00:28:01,986
It is.

487
00:28:02,054 --> 00:28:03,588
And long past due.

488
00:28:03,656 --> 00:28:05,690
Tomorrow then.

489
00:28:06,725 --> 00:28:09,027
A friendly rivalry,
well settled.

490
00:28:11,730 --> 00:28:13,498
You press beyond advantage.

491
00:28:13,566 --> 00:28:14,832
No.

492
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:16,968
I fucking press towards it.

493
00:28:18,137 --> 00:28:20,004
You should have
seen young Vettius,

494
00:28:20,072 --> 00:28:22,507
so easily goaded
into making challenge!

495
00:28:22,575 --> 00:28:24,042
The fucking child!

496
00:28:24,109 --> 00:28:25,043
All men are reduced in years,

497
00:28:25,110 --> 00:28:27,111
when faced with superior mind.

498
00:28:27,179 --> 00:28:29,080
Superior in all accounting!

499
00:28:29,148 --> 00:28:30,448
A fact Tullius
and the rest of the city

500
00:28:30,516 --> 00:28:32,483
will bear witness
to in the marketplace!

501
00:28:32,551 --> 00:28:34,218
Sleep will come
with difficulty tonight.

502
00:28:34,286 --> 00:28:37,388
It's been ages
since I've seen a decent match.

503
00:28:37,456 --> 00:28:38,556
Or Tullius.

504
00:28:38,624 --> 00:28:39,891
In the blush of youth,

505
00:28:39,959 --> 00:28:41,726
he was forever attempting
to slip beneath my robes.

506
00:28:41,794 --> 00:28:42,794
Ha.

507
00:28:42,861 --> 00:28:44,729
You should have
fucking let him.

508
00:28:44,797 --> 00:28:46,731
Tullius has grown
to be a man of worth.

509
00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:50,168
One to be emulated and admired.

510
00:28:50,235 --> 00:28:53,004
And who will you choose
to impress him?

511
00:28:53,072 --> 00:28:55,540
<i>Vettius' foolishness</i>
<i>presents rare opportunity.</i>

512
00:28:55,608 --> 00:28:58,676
The question begs
careful consideration...

513
00:29:07,086 --> 00:29:08,886
I have news to lift the heart.

514
00:29:08,954 --> 00:29:10,955
Vettius has made challenge.

515
00:29:11,023 --> 00:29:12,457
The coward finds his cock.

516
00:29:12,524 --> 00:29:14,559
And I would see it shriveled.

517
00:29:14,627 --> 00:29:17,362
My bestman is to meet his dog
in the marketplace come morning.

518
00:29:17,429 --> 00:29:18,830
The market?

519
00:29:18,897 --> 00:29:20,365
Ah, detail of no consequence.

520
00:29:20,432 --> 00:29:22,467
My question to you is plain.

521
00:29:22,534 --> 00:29:25,503
Is our man prepared
for such a vital match?

522
00:29:27,539 --> 00:29:28,806
Yes, Dominus.

523
00:29:28,874 --> 00:29:30,908
I long to honor
this house once again.

524
00:29:33,712 --> 00:29:35,380
No, I fear you have
mistaken intentions.

525
00:29:37,116 --> 00:29:38,583
I speak of Gannicus.

526
00:29:41,487 --> 00:29:43,454
Gannicus.

527
00:29:46,692 --> 00:29:49,127
The question would
be better put to Doctore.

528
00:29:51,330 --> 00:29:52,630
Leave.

529
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,734
His counsel is always valued,

530
00:29:58,604 --> 00:30:01,539
yet he is my father's man.

531
00:30:01,607 --> 00:30:03,574
His judgment clouded through

532
00:30:03,642 --> 00:30:05,143
a haze of outdated traditions.

533
00:30:05,210 --> 00:30:08,713
I seek a more
visceral assessment.

534
00:30:08,781 --> 00:30:09,647
You and I practically
grew up together

535
00:30:09,715 --> 00:30:11,082
in this ludus.

536
00:30:11,150 --> 00:30:14,085
You have witnessed the rise
and fall of a dozen champions.

537
00:30:15,821 --> 00:30:19,457
What now does your gut
tell you of Gannicus?

538
00:30:20,526 --> 00:30:22,060
<i>Is he worthy of the mantle?</i>

539
00:30:25,130 --> 00:30:26,531
I believe it so.

540
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:29,634
He must truly be,
for you to offer

541
00:30:29,702 --> 00:30:34,172
support despite
your own desires.

542
00:30:34,239 --> 00:30:36,908
I would not give false tongue
to gain advantage.

543
00:30:38,343 --> 00:30:41,212
There are few that
would stand with you so.

544
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:42,447
Your wife's weekly visit.

545
00:30:42,514 --> 00:30:43,448
Two nights hence?

546
00:30:43,515 --> 00:30:44,816
Yes Dominus.

547
00:30:44,883 --> 00:30:47,051
I would see her to your bed
tonight as well.

548
00:30:47,119 --> 00:30:49,754
In gratitude
for honest thoughts.

549
00:30:49,822 --> 00:30:51,789
Dominus.

550
00:30:58,030 --> 00:31:00,832
<i>Do the gods ever</i>
<i>answer your prayers?</i>

551
00:31:00,899 --> 00:31:02,667
They often reveal
their leanings,

552
00:31:02,735 --> 00:31:04,335
though not in words.

553
00:31:04,403 --> 00:31:05,870
Much like my husband.

554
00:31:07,806 --> 00:31:09,640
Dominus summoned me.

555
00:31:09,708 --> 00:31:11,642
To ask of Gannicus.

556
00:31:11,710 --> 00:31:13,711
Gannicus?

557
00:31:13,779 --> 00:31:15,413
He has chosen him as champion,

558
00:31:17,116 --> 00:31:19,550
he is to face Vettius' man
in the marketplace tomorrow.

559
00:31:21,453 --> 00:31:24,088
And this is why you sulk?

560
00:31:24,156 --> 00:31:25,490
The streets are no place

561
00:31:25,557 --> 00:31:27,692
for the mighty Oenomaus
to make his return.

562
00:31:28,961 --> 00:31:31,095
The arena will be home
to your triumphs,

563
00:31:31,163 --> 00:31:33,397
when the time comes.

564
00:31:33,465 --> 00:31:35,733
And I will be there
to witness it...

565
00:32:16,175 --> 00:32:18,176
I will dream of your touch.

566
00:32:18,243 --> 00:32:21,345
As I dream of yours
every night.

567
00:32:34,159 --> 00:32:36,694
<i>♪ Blood rains down</i>
<i>from an angry sky. ♪</i>

568
00:32:36,762 --> 00:32:41,065
<i>♪ My cock rages on,</i>
<i>my cock rages on...♪</i>

569
00:32:41,133 --> 00:32:44,735
♪ The blood rains down,
from an angry sky, ♪

570
00:32:44,803 --> 00:32:48,773
♪ my cock rages on,
my cock rages on...♪

571
00:32:48,841 --> 00:32:50,408
Gannicus!

572
00:32:50,475 --> 00:32:51,642
Brother!

573
00:32:51,710 --> 00:32:53,544
Brother come, drink, join me!

574
00:32:53,612 --> 00:32:55,012
Lower voice!

575
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:56,681
If the Guards
were to hear you...

576
00:32:56,748 --> 00:32:57,949
The guards have already passed.

577
00:32:58,016 --> 00:33:00,051
And were well plied with wine

578
00:33:00,118 --> 00:33:02,220
to keep nose from
fucking business.

579
00:33:02,287 --> 00:33:04,956
Tomorrow you fight
for the honor of this ludus.

580
00:33:05,023 --> 00:33:06,457
Now is not the time for drink.

581
00:33:06,525 --> 00:33:08,359
Every night is time for drink.

582
00:33:09,828 --> 00:33:11,896
For the morning
sun may greet you

583
00:33:11,964 --> 00:33:17,501
with your last fucking day.

584
00:33:22,975 --> 00:33:25,776
Fall to your bed.

585
00:33:25,844 --> 00:33:28,512
Or risk steeper plummet
against Vettius' man.

586
00:33:28,580 --> 00:33:32,483
Words of wisdom, well received,
well, well, received.

587
00:33:36,088 --> 00:33:37,955
Oenomaus?

588
00:33:40,425 --> 00:33:42,560
It should be you tomorrow.

589
00:33:53,672 --> 00:33:55,973
Where is good Vettius?

590
00:33:56,041 --> 00:33:57,642
Is he among you?

591
00:33:57,709 --> 00:33:59,810
Or did he come to sense,
and remain within

592
00:33:59,878 --> 00:34:01,545
the warm safety of his bed?

593
00:34:01,613 --> 00:34:02,747
Ah!

594
00:34:02,814 --> 00:34:04,582
<i>There he stands!</i>

595
00:34:04,650 --> 00:34:07,218
Fresh and young
as a newborn calf!

596
00:34:07,286 --> 00:34:09,654
The fool at last shows himself.

597
00:34:09,721 --> 00:34:11,155
Batiatus.

598
00:34:11,223 --> 00:34:13,925
We had begun to fret
on your arrival.

599
00:34:13,992 --> 00:34:16,160
Although I see you arrive
with unexpected gift...

600
00:34:17,896 --> 00:34:19,697
It has been too long, Gaia.

601
00:34:19,765 --> 00:34:21,299
And grows longer still.

602
00:34:21,366 --> 00:34:22,800
Apologies for my delay.

603
00:34:22,868 --> 00:34:26,771
I had much difficulty
in the choosing of a man.

604
00:34:26,838 --> 00:34:28,506
<i>An imposing task,</i>

605
00:34:28,573 --> 00:34:30,908
when each among
my stable stands a titan!

606
00:34:32,177 --> 00:34:35,046
Perhaps good Vettius
should have taken more time

607
00:34:35,113 --> 00:34:36,614
with the choosing of his own.

608
00:34:36,682 --> 00:34:40,017
Words fall from your mouth,
as shit from ass.

609
00:34:40,085 --> 00:34:43,120
Let us not become mired
in base exchange.

610
00:34:44,756 --> 00:34:47,425
We are gathered
this glorious day

611
00:34:47,492 --> 00:34:51,362
to witness honorable contest
between respected rivals.

612
00:34:52,998 --> 00:34:54,465
Clear space!

613
00:34:58,770 --> 00:35:00,237
The years have favored Tullius.

614
00:35:00,305 --> 00:35:03,307
And his purse.

615
00:35:03,375 --> 00:35:04,709
A brawl in the streets.

616
00:35:04,776 --> 00:35:06,577
Where is the honor
in such a thing?

617
00:35:06,645 --> 00:35:07,912
Fuck honor.

618
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:09,213
This is business.

619
00:35:09,281 --> 00:35:12,550
Gratitude to Magistrate Sextus

620
00:35:12,617 --> 00:35:14,518
The event turns
larger than expected.

621
00:35:14,586 --> 00:35:15,686
<i>for allowing</i>
<i>such thrilling event</i>

622
00:35:15,754 --> 00:35:17,588
Your mad schemes
may yet bear fruit.

623
00:35:17,656 --> 00:35:19,056
Enough for both of us
to feast upon.

624
00:35:19,124 --> 00:35:21,659
<i>In the streets</i>
<i>of the great city of Capua!</i>

625
00:35:24,696 --> 00:35:26,797
Batiatus.

626
00:35:26,865 --> 00:35:29,100
Present your man.

627
00:35:29,167 --> 00:35:34,005
In honor of the Magistrate,
esteemed Tullius,

628
00:35:34,072 --> 00:35:36,273
<i>and the good people of Capua...</i>

629
00:35:36,341 --> 00:35:39,076
I give you the fearless Gaul ever

630
00:35:39,144 --> 00:35:43,114
to take up arms in the arena!

631
00:35:43,181 --> 00:35:44,548
Slayer of beasts!

632
00:35:44,616 --> 00:35:47,718
Conqueror of giants!

633
00:35:47,786 --> 00:35:50,888
Behold Gannicus!

634
00:35:50,956 --> 00:35:53,424
<i>Champion</i>
<i>of the House of Batiatus!</i>

635
00:36:00,365 --> 00:36:02,633
A fine choice.

636
00:36:04,102 --> 00:36:04,668
Vettius.

637
00:36:04,736 --> 00:36:05,970
Present your man.

638
00:36:06,038 --> 00:36:08,939
I have no tongue
for overripe embellishment.

639
00:36:09,007 --> 00:36:10,608
Nor is it required.

640
00:36:10,675 --> 00:36:12,376
<i>Otho! Stand forth!</i>

641
00:36:14,813 --> 00:36:16,280
Grrrr!

642
00:36:20,619 --> 00:36:22,319
Your day finally comes.

643
00:36:22,387 --> 00:36:24,188
And yours ends.

644
00:36:24,256 --> 00:36:28,426
Gratitude to Batiatus
and Vettius.

645
00:36:28,493 --> 00:36:32,229
Now, let us judge
who stands the better house!

646
00:36:37,903 --> 00:36:39,770
Apologies, Magistrate.

647
00:36:41,373 --> 00:36:42,840
There appears to
be something missing.

648
00:36:45,777 --> 00:36:47,044
Where is your man's blindfold?

649
00:36:49,181 --> 00:36:50,281
Blindfold?

650
00:36:50,348 --> 00:36:51,649
What the fuck...

651
00:36:53,518 --> 00:36:55,719
That was your boast,
was it not?

652
00:36:58,457 --> 00:37:03,027
That your gladiator could best
any of my men absent sight...?

653
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:11,202
You did voice such challenge.

654
00:37:11,269 --> 00:37:13,804
A simple figure of speech,
not meant to be...

655
00:37:13,872 --> 00:37:15,473
Good Tullius...

656
00:37:15,540 --> 00:37:18,075
If Batiatus does not
wish to honor terms,

657
00:37:18,143 --> 00:37:19,810
he should remove himself.

658
00:37:19,878 --> 00:37:21,579
With tail between legs.

659
00:37:33,391 --> 00:37:35,025
Doctore.

660
00:37:37,662 --> 00:37:43,501
Come...the task should
not be that difficult.

661
00:37:43,568 --> 00:37:46,337
I need only direct my blades
towards the smell of shit.

662
00:37:48,406 --> 00:37:50,508
Gannicus. Ever the fool.

663
00:37:59,651 --> 00:38:01,352
You are going
to allow this, Quintus?

664
00:38:01,419 --> 00:38:03,254
The choice has been
removed from my hands.

665
00:38:08,193 --> 00:38:09,393
Begin!

666
00:38:32,517 --> 00:38:33,617
Yes!

667
00:38:43,962 --> 00:38:45,462
How thrilling.

668
00:38:45,530 --> 00:38:47,531
I have never seen such a thing.

669
00:38:47,599 --> 00:38:49,200
For good reason.

670
00:39:20,031 --> 00:39:21,565
A noble attempt.

671
00:39:21,633 --> 00:39:23,467
To be remembered
only in its failing.

672
00:40:05,777 --> 00:40:07,144
Get up!

673
00:40:16,655 --> 00:40:17,888
Yes!

674
00:40:24,596 --> 00:40:26,630
Fucking kill him!

675
00:40:29,701 --> 00:40:31,235
Yes!

676
00:40:46,051 --> 00:40:49,353
Have you ever
fucking seen the like?

677
00:40:51,323 --> 00:40:55,292
<i>Perhaps good Vettius should</i>
<i>pit a man less prone to death</i>

678
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:57,828
against the mighty Gannicus!

679
00:40:57,896 --> 00:40:59,863
An impressive display,
Batiatus.

680
00:40:59,931 --> 00:41:01,332
<i>One not soon forgotten.</i>

681
00:41:03,001 --> 00:41:05,436
Gannicus is truly a wonder.

682
00:41:05,503 --> 00:41:08,539
One deserving more prominent
position in the games.

683
00:41:08,606 --> 00:41:10,641
You gaze upon my very thoughts.

684
00:41:10,709 --> 00:41:12,409
Commitments beckon.

685
00:41:12,477 --> 00:41:15,145
Join me at Nestor's shop
after the market closes,

686
00:41:15,213 --> 00:41:18,115
and we shall discuss
your man at length.

687
00:41:33,331 --> 00:41:38,001
Only mad Gannicus could win
contest fucking blindfolded!

688
00:41:38,069 --> 00:41:40,337
<i>Barca could do the same!</i>

689
00:41:40,405 --> 00:41:43,240
And I would kill you
for being a fool.

690
00:41:43,975 --> 00:41:46,176
<i>Auctus speaks truth.</i>

691
00:41:46,244 --> 00:41:51,081
Facing Vettius' man
absent sight was beyond foolish.

692
00:41:51,149 --> 00:41:54,718
The gods must have taken
pity on your addled brain.

693
00:41:54,786 --> 00:41:57,287
The gods had naught
to do with it.

694
00:41:57,355 --> 00:42:01,425
Otho he grunts like a stuck pig
before each attack.

695
00:42:01,493 --> 00:42:03,627
His squeals
they gave way position!

696
00:42:05,063 --> 00:42:08,399
Your victory lifts the heart.

697
00:42:08,466 --> 00:42:10,768
You will not be rid
of Gannicus so easily brother.

698
00:42:13,271 --> 00:42:15,606
Dominus he rewards me
with all the wine

699
00:42:15,673 --> 00:42:19,176
that I can drink and I would
share it with my brothers!

700
00:42:22,313 --> 00:42:23,814
Those that bear the mark.

701
00:42:27,285 --> 00:42:28,886
One day.

702
00:42:31,923 --> 00:42:34,491
Gannicus' victory forges
path to greater glory.

703
00:42:36,327 --> 00:42:37,461
With Tullius' support,

704
00:42:37,529 --> 00:42:40,264
we can finally gain
proper position in games!

705
00:42:40,331 --> 00:42:42,966
Maybe a place in the opening
ceremony of the new arena.

706
00:42:43,034 --> 00:42:44,435
After such
a magnificent showing,

707
00:42:44,502 --> 00:42:46,103
I have no doubt Gannicus

708
00:42:46,171 --> 00:42:48,205
will be offered a place
in the primus.

709
00:42:48,273 --> 00:42:50,073
Primus...

710
00:42:50,141 --> 00:42:54,111
Yeah, I favor
the fucking sound of that.

711
00:42:56,314 --> 00:42:58,215
Expect late return.

712
00:42:58,283 --> 00:43:00,117
<i>I would seek out</i>
<i>Solonius afterwards,</i>

713
00:43:00,185 --> 00:43:03,253
to discuss extending
advantage to his house as well.

714
00:43:04,823 --> 00:43:07,558
Send Tullius my regards.

715
00:43:07,625 --> 00:43:10,127
And gauge his response
in remembering me.

716
00:43:11,896 --> 00:43:13,831
How could he fucking
forget you.

717
00:43:17,802 --> 00:43:21,305
It staggers mind,
the change in him.

718
00:43:21,372 --> 00:43:23,273
Change?

719
00:43:23,341 --> 00:43:24,441
You know my meaning.

720
00:43:24,509 --> 00:43:26,510
He always seemed so...

721
00:43:26,578 --> 00:43:27,945
demure and cowed.

722
00:43:28,012 --> 00:43:30,080
Now he positively burns.

723
00:43:30,148 --> 00:43:33,016
He has always done so.

724
00:43:33,084 --> 00:43:36,019
His light was merely muted
by the shadow of his father.

725
00:43:36,087 --> 00:43:39,389
The man could turn day to night
with disapproving frown.

726
00:43:41,726 --> 00:43:43,494
He never cared much for me.

727
00:43:45,296 --> 00:43:49,266
Or, I suspect, anything
that smacked of enjoyment...

728
00:43:52,237 --> 00:43:54,705
And what might this be?

729
00:43:54,772 --> 00:43:56,373
More gifts from Rome.

730
00:43:58,610 --> 00:44:01,745
The finest opium,
carried from Cyprus.

731
00:44:06,084 --> 00:44:08,652
I have not partaken
in many years.

732
00:44:10,121 --> 00:44:11,522
My husband...

733
00:44:11,589 --> 00:44:13,757
Will be gone most
of the night...

734
00:44:19,330 --> 00:44:22,499
Good Batiatus.

735
00:44:22,567 --> 00:44:26,270
<i>Word of Gannicus' victory</i>
<i>has spread throughout the city.</i>

736
00:44:26,337 --> 00:44:29,706
His name- and yours-
fall from every mouth.

737
00:44:29,774 --> 00:44:31,508
May they always find
the taste pleasing.

738
00:44:33,144 --> 00:44:35,379
Everyone clamors
to see your man again.

739
00:44:35,446 --> 00:44:36,680
With exception of poor Vettius.

740
00:44:36,748 --> 00:44:38,815
He is fit for seizure
from the ordeal.

741
00:44:38,883 --> 00:44:40,250
Unfortunate.

742
00:44:40,318 --> 00:44:43,487
That he could not provide
more worthy opponent.

743
00:44:43,555 --> 00:44:45,722
Yet his stock is well known
to be of inferior quality,

744
00:44:45,790 --> 00:44:47,357
as is the boy himself.

745
00:44:47,425 --> 00:44:49,893
The manner in which
he tends the ludus.

746
00:44:49,961 --> 00:44:52,396
The child has no fucking
talent for it.

747
00:44:54,032 --> 00:44:55,999
You surprise me, Batiatus.

748
00:44:56,067 --> 00:44:59,102
Your disposition towards
business is much more...

749
00:44:59,170 --> 00:45:01,171
aggressive than your father's.

750
00:45:02,473 --> 00:45:04,274
We are of diverging
temperament.

751
00:45:04,342 --> 00:45:06,243
And desires.

752
00:45:06,311 --> 00:45:09,046
How does he fare in Sicilia?

753
00:45:10,348 --> 00:45:13,050
The clime is more agreeable
to various conditions

754
00:45:13,117 --> 00:45:16,787
brought about by
the passing of the years.

755
00:45:16,854 --> 00:45:19,823
How did the Magistrate
take to Gannicus' display?

756
00:45:19,891 --> 00:45:22,492
Ignited by it,
as was the crowd.

757
00:45:24,395 --> 00:45:26,496
He even broached subject
of retaining the man.

758
00:45:26,564 --> 00:45:28,699
For the opening games
of the new arena.

759
00:45:29,901 --> 00:45:31,935
Gannicus in the opening games?

760
00:45:34,205 --> 00:45:35,138
If you could aid
in such a thing,

761
00:45:35,206 --> 00:45:37,407
I would forever
be in your debt.

762
00:45:37,475 --> 00:45:40,444
It merely requires a word
in the proper ear.

763
00:45:40,511 --> 00:45:43,480
All that remains
is to agree upon a price.

764
00:45:43,548 --> 00:45:47,050
Ah, of course I would be happy
to see coin to your hand

765
00:45:47,118 --> 00:45:49,386
in exchange for assistance.

766
00:45:49,454 --> 00:45:52,155
What, err, sum
did you have in mind?

767
00:45:54,959 --> 00:45:57,594
You misunderstand, Batiatus.

768
00:45:57,662 --> 00:45:59,296
I do not offer
a broker arrangement.

769
00:45:59,364 --> 00:46:00,764
I offer to purchase your man.

770
00:46:04,302 --> 00:46:05,736
Purchase?

771
00:46:05,803 --> 00:46:08,572
But why would you
want a gladiator?

772
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:09,573
You're not a lanista.

773
00:46:09,641 --> 00:46:12,175
Jupiter's cock, no.

774
00:46:12,243 --> 00:46:14,044
Yet I have many
vested interests.

775
00:46:14,112 --> 00:46:15,345
In shipping.

776
00:46:15,413 --> 00:46:16,480
Goods and services.

777
00:46:16,547 --> 00:46:19,082
This very shop.

778
00:46:19,150 --> 00:46:20,884
And young Vettius' ludus.

779
00:46:27,425 --> 00:46:29,493
<i>Look at the little fuck now.</i>

780
00:46:29,560 --> 00:46:30,894
About to shit himself.

781
00:46:30,962 --> 00:46:32,462
Still your tongue.

782
00:46:32,530 --> 00:46:34,231
The grownups are talking.

783
00:46:37,568 --> 00:46:40,337
Two hundred denarii.

784
00:46:40,405 --> 00:46:42,172
A generous offer.

785
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:43,540
In respect of your father.

786
00:46:45,677 --> 00:46:46,710
Apologies.

787
00:46:47,812 --> 00:46:49,546
I would not part with the man.

788
00:46:53,317 --> 00:46:57,254
I allowed you to purchase
one of my slaves.

789
00:46:57,321 --> 00:46:59,890
Yet now you deny me
the same opportunity?

790
00:47:01,059 --> 00:47:02,926
Gannicus is not for sale.

791
00:47:05,296 --> 00:47:07,364
Everything is for sale,
Batiatus.

792
00:47:09,033 --> 00:47:10,634
The question is but price.

793
00:48:26,177 --> 00:48:28,078
I make fair offer.

794
00:48:29,413 --> 00:48:32,415
And you produce
cock to piss on me.

795
00:48:34,385 --> 00:48:36,386
Do you know what that
feels like, Batiatus?

796
00:48:57,978 --> 00:49:00,108
Reconsider your answer.

797
00:49:00,702 --> 00:49:02,779
Or be excluded
from the games forever.

798
00:49:24,033 --> 00:49:33,147
