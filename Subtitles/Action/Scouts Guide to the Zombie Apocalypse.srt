we're still trying to contain it.

898
00:53:57,903 --> 00:54:00,023
What about everyone at the party?
Were they evacuated?

899
00:54:00,614 --> 00:54:01,781

Well, where is everybody?

902
00:54:46,159 --> 00:54:48,828
Nobody's here. It must be a mistake.

Yeah, 1146 Dunton Avenue. This is it.

904
00:54:52,165 --> 00:54:55,251
It's not a mistake, Carter.
Jeff sent you a fake address.

I can't believe he sent us
a fucking fake address!

BEN: Why does it surprise you?

911
00:55:07,973 --> 00:55:10,734
I mean, did you actually think
he was gonna invite us to a real party?

912
00:55:11,518 --> 00:55:12,686
Karma.

913
00:55:13,186 --> 00:55:14,270

- Nothing.
- No, speak up.

915
00:55:16,147 --> 00:55:17,732
Well, I just think it's a little ironic

916
00:55:17,816 --> 00:55:20,694
that, you know, you're all upset now
because you got ditched.

917
00:55:20,860 --> 00:55:23,446
Oh, okay.
So you're saying that we deserve it.

918

We went to your stupid campout, dude.

919
00:55:25,240 --> 00:55:26,783
You lied to me.

920

behind me this time.

- No.
- Dude, that's like incest.

No, it's not, I'm not even related to her.

938

So you do like her, then.

where the party is.
