minimal civilian traffic was hijacked.

What are they transporting?

We need you to infiltrate,
locate the device,

we don't know who has it.

and there's checkpoints everywhere.

526
00:47:06,166 --> 00:47:07,415
Fuck!

527
00:47:40,605 --> 00:47:43,719
- Where are you going?
- (LOLA GRUNTING)

528
00:47:45,708 --> 00:47:48,895
I knew you'd be fun to play with
the second I saw you.

529
00:48:10,941 --> 00:48:13,961
I really love this game.

530
00:48:32,592 --> 00:48:34,737
Do I look like a bitch?

531
00:48:37,976 --> 00:48:40,965
Hey, Rayzah.
I heard shouts.

532
00:48:40,965 --> 00:48:44,016
You can play but not too hard, okay?

533
00:48:45,099 --> 00:48:46,235
You are one lucky bitch.

534
00:48:46,245 --> 00:48:49,192
(PANTING)

535
00:48:57,742 --> 00:48:59,690
What do we got here?

536
00:48:59,731 --> 00:49:01,741
Take us to Tremaine.

537
00:49:12,405 --> 00:49:16,477
K2, get your fat ass up here!
We got a guest coming!

538
00:49:18,560 --> 00:49:21,507
Yeti, move it!
Upstairs, now!

539
00:49:21,517 --> 00:49:23,559
It's show time!

540
00:49:27,808 --> 00:49:30,015
Damien, you see that?

541
00:49:43,575 --> 00:49:45,657
Lino.

542
00:49:46,709 --> 00:49:49,625
Surprised that your back here so soon.

543
00:49:49,656 --> 00:49:52,718
You see?
He is surprised.

544
00:49:52,958 --> 00:49:55,978
- Who's your boy?
- I'm his driver.

545
00:49:56,019 --> 00:49:57,956
He's a cop.

546
00:49:59,112 --> 00:50:03,174
- Comes for his bomb.
- Thanks. Thanks for that.

547
00:50:03,216 --> 00:50:06,538
- That's great.
- Wow, a cop.

548
00:50:06,548 --> 00:50:09,391
Haven't seen one of those
around here in years.

549
00:50:09,401 --> 00:50:13,588
I believe the police station closed around
the same time as the school, the hospital.

550
00:50:13,640 --> 00:50:16,754
The government thought
we didn't need that around here.

551
00:50:16,837 --> 00:50:19,784
So, what, you're the new Sheriff in town?

552
00:50:19,826 --> 00:50:21,898
You're a brave man.

553
00:50:24,127 --> 00:50:26,106
Where's Lola?

554
00:50:26,116 --> 00:50:27,210
We'll get to her.

555
00:50:27,220 --> 00:50:29,407
Let's talk about this bomb.
You're here to buy?

556
00:50:30,386 --> 00:50:32,292
I came to disarm it.

557
00:50:32,333 --> 00:50:34,437
This is gonna make you a little bit anxious.
It's ticking.

558
00:50:34,447 --> 00:50:37,572
Tremaine Alexander don't do anxious.
I cause anxious.

559
00:50:37,613 --> 00:50:40,727
I could be halfway down South
before this thing goes off

560
00:50:40,779 --> 00:50:42,758
or you can make me an offer.

561
00:50:42,758 --> 00:50:45,038
I'll offer you to disable it before
it blows us all up, you like that?

562
00:50:45,080 --> 00:50:49,152
That won't fly. How about I just
send it back the way I found it?

563
00:50:49,152 --> 00:50:51,224
K2, let the sunshine in.

564
00:50:51,266 --> 00:50:54,286
Gentleman, please,
your gonna love the view.

565
00:51:14,167 --> 00:51:16,187
Only a crazy person would have a rocket.

566
00:51:16,218 --> 00:51:18,291
We live in a war,
so we prepared for war.

567
00:51:18,301 --> 00:51:22,404
I can destroy downtown
at a push of this button.

568
00:51:22,435 --> 00:51:24,414
Let's talk numbers.

569
00:51:24,456 --> 00:51:27,549
You let all those people die for money?
That's low even for you.

570
00:51:27,580 --> 00:51:30,767
Nigga, where I come from,
everything is about cash.

571
00:51:30,808 --> 00:51:32,860
You know what that means, right?

572
00:51:32,902 --> 00:51:33,901
(LAUGHING)

573
00:51:33,943 --> 00:51:36,890
First I need to know Lola's okay.

574
00:51:41,129 --> 00:51:42,337
Rayzah.

575
00:51:43,180 --> 00:51:45,232
Look at number three.

576
00:51:56,844 --> 00:51:58,854
What do you see?

577
00:52:05,279 --> 00:52:08,122
What do you see Lino?

578
00:52:12,579 --> 00:52:15,495
- (LINO SHOUTING)
- No, no, wait.

579
00:52:15,537 --> 00:52:17,516
Coward!

580
00:52:17,516 --> 00:52:19,734
- You wanna die here man?
- Don't shoot.

581
00:52:23,910 --> 00:52:28,003
Now's not the time.
Lino, not now.

582
00:52:28,117 --> 00:52:30,158
Now you boys all excited

583
00:52:30,158 --> 00:52:33,220
let's do this shit the uptown way.

584
00:52:33,251 --> 00:52:35,438
I got a rocket, I got a bomb
and I got a pretty woman.

585
00:52:35,480 --> 00:52:38,427
I say we starts the bidding at
10 million dollars.

586
00:52:38,438 --> 00:52:40,375
- Do I hear 11?
- 11.

587
00:52:40,416 --> 00:52:41,624
- 11 million.
- 12

588
00:52:41,635 --> 00:52:44,540
Oh, that's a spicy bid right there.
We gettin there now.

589
00:52:44,582 --> 00:52:47,737
- 15.
- 15? Stop the bullshit!

590
00:52:47,748 --> 00:52:50,966
You tell me how much it's worth to you?
How much the people downtown worth?

591
00:52:51,007 --> 00:52:54,038
Because around here,
people lives aren't worth a shit.

592
00:52:54,038 --> 00:52:57,152
Look around, Sheriff,
this used to be a palace.

593
00:52:57,193 --> 00:52:59,266
Doorman, woman waiting on table.

594
00:52:59,287 --> 00:53:02,369
Where the bitches at now?
In the alley, shooting up.

595
00:53:02,411 --> 00:53:04,462
Because of drugs dealer like you.

596
00:53:04,462 --> 00:53:06,472
I didn't cause this reality.

597
00:53:06,514 --> 00:53:09,701
I just help them ease the pain.

598
00:53:09,711 --> 00:53:10,805
Let's get back to that money.

599
00:53:10,857 --> 00:53:12,898
- We're at 15 million, right?
- 15.

600
00:53:12,939 --> 00:53:13,970
- Do I hear 20 million?
- 20.

601
00:53:13,981 --> 00:53:16,855
Okay, stop the game.
What's it gonna take?

602
00:53:16,897 --> 00:53:18,917
You got 3 million people downtown.

603
00:53:18,917 --> 00:53:21,167
10 dollars per person.
Price of a happy meal.

604
00:53:21,177 --> 00:53:23,114
That's 30 million dollars for me.

605
00:53:23,156 --> 00:53:25,228
- Then 30 million?
- 30 million.

606
00:53:25,270 --> 00:53:27,321
Done.
30 million it is.

607
00:53:27,321 --> 00:53:28,571
30 million.

608
00:53:28,613 --> 00:53:33,611
Sold to Lino Dupree and the
new Sheriff of Brick Mansions.

609
00:53:33,716 --> 00:53:35,694
Call your people and make it happen.

610
00:53:36,850 --> 00:53:39,933
And Lino, stay out of my business.

611
00:53:40,839 --> 00:53:44,140
(DIALING, CELLPHONE RINGING)

612
00:53:46,056 --> 00:53:47,337
- Yes?
- It's Detective Collier.

613
00:53:47,337 --> 00:53:51,294
- Collier? Where are we now?
- We're close. Really close.

614
00:53:51,305 --> 00:53:54,523
- Close enough to punch the code in?
- No, unfortunately no.

615
00:53:54,533 --> 00:53:55,596
What's the problem?

616
00:53:55,606 --> 00:53:57,720
The problem is that
the new owner wants to sell.

617
00:53:57,730 --> 00:53:59,709
Are you sure the bomb is there?

618
00:53:59,740 --> 00:54:03,698
Yes, and I can tell you that there's
only 48 minutes before it blows up.

619
00:54:03,708 --> 00:54:04,812
Okay.

620
00:54:04,989 --> 00:54:07,978
- How do we proceed?
- You have an Hawaiian bank account?

621
00:54:07,978 --> 00:54:11,165
- I want it in cash, man.
- They can't do cash.

622
00:54:11,248 --> 00:54:14,195
- We still got an account in Hawaii?
- We do.

623
00:54:14,237 --> 00:54:15,445
Give him the numbers.

624
00:54:15,455 --> 00:54:18,361
Bank, 83675.

625
00:54:18,371 --> 00:54:20,444
Bank, 83675.

626
00:54:20,454 --> 00:54:22,506
Account, 0210-84.

627
00:54:22,537 --> 00:54:24,828
Account, 0210-84.

628
00:54:25,776 --> 00:54:28,723
- What's he asking?
- 30 million dollars.

629
00:54:28,973 --> 00:54:29,972
Hold on.

630
00:54:30,014 --> 00:54:32,888
Tremaine wants 30 million
for the device.

631
00:54:32,899 --> 00:54:34,971
The city damn near broke.

632
00:54:36,127 --> 00:54:38,200
- We cannot do that, Detective.
- All right, good.

633
00:54:38,210 --> 00:54:40,355
You have to find another solution.

634
00:54:47,666 --> 00:54:48,759
Exactly.

635
00:54:49,645 --> 00:54:51,696
All right, good, yeah.

636
00:54:51,696 --> 00:54:52,831
Perfect.

637
00:54:52,946 --> 00:54:55,966
That's a wrap.
They're sending in the money.

638
00:54:55,997 --> 00:54:58,955
- Let's go disable that bomb.
- Hold on.

639
00:54:58,955 --> 00:55:02,048
Wait a minute,
let my man verify the transfer.

640
00:55:02,287 --> 00:55:05,245
Bank doesn't open for another 25 minutes.

641
00:55:05,245 --> 00:55:06,380
25 minutes.

642
00:55:06,422 --> 00:55:08,567
Well, that's enough time for me
to finish dinner.

643
00:55:08,577 --> 00:55:10,525
K2.

644
00:55:10,525 --> 00:55:13,514
Show our guests to the presidential suite.

645
00:55:14,524 --> 00:55:16,742
Nice doing business with you, Sheriff.

646
00:55:16,784 --> 00:55:17,679
Move!

647
00:55:17,690 --> 00:55:19,939
Sometimes you dont gotta be a rocket scientist.

648
00:55:19,981 --> 00:55:22,032
Just got to have a rocket.

649
00:55:46,974 --> 00:55:48,120
Move!

650
00:55:48,120 --> 00:55:50,098
Face the rack!

651
00:55:50,973 --> 00:55:52,108
- On your knees!
- Shit.

652
00:55:52,150 --> 00:55:54,233
Put your damn hands behind your head!

653
00:55:54,243 --> 00:55:57,295
I got to tell you,
I'm claustrophobic.

654
00:55:58,482 --> 00:56:02,397
Until Tremaine gets his 30 million,
their lives worth more than both of us.

655
00:56:02,439 --> 00:56:05,532
They die, you die.

656
00:56:11,895 --> 00:56:13,874
So you're not having a plan gets us in.

657
00:56:13,874 --> 00:56:16,154
Hey, you know where the bomb is,
I know where Lola is.

658
00:56:16,196 --> 00:56:18,248
And in 25 minutes, we act.

659
00:56:18,248 --> 00:56:20,320
In 25 minutes Tremaine is gonna shoot us.

660
00:56:20,372 --> 00:56:22,476
The device is gonna kill 3 million people.

661
00:56:22,486 --> 00:56:25,579
What? When he gets his money,
everybody walks away.

662
00:56:25,579 --> 00:56:26,683
There is no money.

663
00:56:26,694 --> 00:56:29,578
The city can't pay.
I was just trying to buy us some time.

664
00:56:29,578 --> 00:56:30,713
Forget what I said before.

665
00:56:30,765 --> 00:56:33,744
Don't trust your instinct.
They're shit.

666
00:56:33,952 --> 00:56:36,004
I should've killed Tremaine
when I had the chance.

667
00:56:36,004 --> 00:56:38,024
Shut up.

668
00:56:40,076 --> 00:56:41,180
Wait.

669
00:56:41,190 --> 00:56:44,377
That story about Tremaine killing
your friend, it's true?

670
00:56:45,179 --> 00:56:48,480
That's my father. He used to
lead some officers on a drug raid.

671
00:56:48,480 --> 00:56:52,645
He got separated from his squad.
Tremaine's boys captured him and killed him.

672
00:56:52,687 --> 00:56:54,562
I'm sorry.

673
00:56:55,676 --> 00:56:58,769
Let's go make him pay.
Back me up.

674
00:57:02,976 --> 00:57:05,017
Help him man!

675
00:57:06,236 --> 00:57:09,225
Stop it!

676
00:57:09,225 --> 00:57:11,412
- Son of a bitch.
- What happened?

677
00:57:11,453 --> 00:57:13,317
Oh, shit.

678
00:57:13,328 --> 00:57:14,567
- He's not breathing.
- What?

679
00:57:14,578 --> 00:57:16,525
We got to get him out of here.

680
00:57:16,660 --> 00:57:18,608
Shit.

681
00:57:18,743 --> 00:57:21,628
- Oh, come on!
- He's not breathing, come on!

682
00:57:21,670 --> 00:57:23,877
- Okay, go!
- Open the gate!

683
00:57:23,888 --> 00:57:25,794
I will talk to the boss.

684
00:57:27,855 --> 00:57:29,064
Go!

685
00:57:37,343 --> 00:57:40,425
- Something's not right about this.
- You think they'll come up with the money?

686
00:57:40,436 --> 00:57:41,498
We'll see.

687
00:57:41,508 --> 00:57:42,612
Tell me how you got that bomb again.

688
00:57:42,623 --> 00:57:46,778
Bomb? Yeah. These dudes at base told
me about some weapon being moved.

689
00:57:46,820 --> 00:57:49,881
No security.
Keys left in the truck.

690
00:57:49,881 --> 00:57:51,860
Easy money, baby.

691
00:57:51,902 --> 00:57:55,120
That's whats bothering me man.
You can never trust easy.

692
00:58:01,285 --> 00:58:03,420
- I'm okay.
- You're crazy.

693
00:58:03,472 --> 00:58:06,450
We're out of the room.
Your turn cop.

694
00:58:06,461 --> 00:58:09,720
Is this some kind of game to you?

695
00:58:10,626 --> 00:58:11,803

- More or less.

Different method, same result.

- But you still need the key.

00:59:32,981 --> 00:59:34,887
Go, go!

710
00:59:34,897 --> 00:59:36,168

- Faster!
- You wanna drive?

716
01:00:06,337 --> 01:00:08,410
- Go ahead, drive.
- Whoah, whoah.

717
01:00:11,378 --> 01:00:12,409
I need to get out.

718
01:00:12,450 --> 01:00:14,471
What are you trying to do
Jumping out of the damn car for?

719
01:00:14,471 --> 01:00:15,751
- Where you going?
- I'm trying to get rid of these guys.

720
01:00:15,793 --> 01:00:17,730
Will you shut up?

721
01:00:32,258 --> 01:00:34,403
I don't see them!

- Why didn't you tell me that?

- Come on, tell me, which way?
- Left, left!

I told you to stay down!

730

Look, we can't just run to that rooftop.
They're gonna be expecting us.

- You got a better solution?
- I'm working on it.

Hello. What?

747
01:04:54,682 --> 01:04:56,859
Okay.
I'm gonna bring it up right now.

748
01:04:58,890 --> 01:05:00,931
We have an issue.

749
01:05:01,004 --> 01:05:04,024
These are satellite surveillance
images from Brick Mansions

01:05:04,066 --> 01:05:05,201

751
01:05:05,211 --> 01:05:08,158
- There's the bomb.
- What's that?

752
01:05:08,158 --> 01:05:11,532
That's an old Russian missile.
Has a radius about 5 miles.

753
01:05:11,564 --> 01:05:15,459
- How the hell did they get that?
- Wait, if they launch that...

754
01:05:15,459 --> 01:05:17,604
- The city is ground zero.
- We're gonna have to evacuate.

755
01:05:17,614 --> 01:05:19,624
- No time.
- There's a fallout shelter.

756
01:05:19,635 --> 01:05:21,769
It won't help us against the NAD blast.

757
01:05:21,822 --> 01:05:22,957
What options do we have then?
Drone?

758
01:05:22,967 --> 01:05:26,956
Too late. We'll never get
authorization just like that.

759
01:05:32,204 --> 01:05:34,423
- Bank is open.
- I'll check.

760
01:05:40,619 --> 01:05:43,608
I think they fooled us.
No deposit.

761
01:05:43,608 --> 01:05:45,826
And you wonder why people
don't trust the government.

762

What the hell is going on?

763
01:05:50,908 --> 01:05:52,918
Not only did they not make the transfer.

764
01:05:54,241 --> 01:05:57,229
They're emptying all of our bank accounts.

765
01:06:01,260 --> 01:06:04,623

Stay clear.

- What was that?
- Looks like they shot the launch mechanism.

780
01:07:23,614 --> 01:07:26,801
- The missile can't launch.
- We're still in the game.

781
01:07:29,800 --> 01:07:31,946

do it or die trying.

- You watch your tone, woman.

Watch my tone?
What is wrong with you?

Untie the girl!

01:13:06,165 --> 01:13:08,373

and do this myself.

Welcome to our world.

871
01:18:04,195 --> 01:18:07,309
So, what are we gonna do
with this shit?

872
01:18:14,380 --> 01:18:16,526
Let's give it back.

873
01:18:29,075 --> 01:18:33,178
- For you Captain.
- Thank you son.

874
01:18:49,892 --> 01:18:51,996
- Hold it!
- Let's go!

875
01:18:52,017 --> 01:18:56,172
Hey, come on, no stairs!
Elevator! Let's go, now!

876
01:19:05,566 --> 01:19:08,659
- This is better than the stairs.
- Yeah.

877
01:19:13,866 --> 01:19:16,115
(CLAMORING)

878
01:19:24,290 --> 01:19:25,300
I can't reach him.

879
01:19:25,373 --> 01:19:28,518
We don't have a satellite image.
If the bomb went off, we would've heard it.

880
01:19:28,570 --> 01:19:31,590
I don't like this.
I don't like this at all.

881
01:19:32,528 --> 01:19:34,777
He's our man.
He'll get back to us.

882
01:19:35,798 --> 01:19:36,902
Hello.

883
01:19:38,016 --> 01:19:40,901
What do you mean
they're inside the building?

884
01:19:47,191 --> 01:19:51,346
Hey, you boys remember Lino?
My eyes in Brick Mansions?

885
01:19:52,575 --> 01:19:54,554
Well, he showed me a lot.

886
01:19:56,470 --> 01:19:59,656
Mr. Mayor.
Great place you got here.

887
01:20:05,957 --> 01:20:11,195
Tremaine Alexander.
I'm like the Mayor of Brick Mansions.

888
01:20:11,237 --> 01:20:14,226
It's a pleasure to meet my constituter.

889
01:20:14,465 --> 01:20:19,433
On behalf on myself,
a new appointed Sheriff and Lino

890
01:20:19,443 --> 01:20:22,495
and the citizen of Brick Mansions.

891
01:20:22,536 --> 01:20:26,691
We decided to give you
a campaign contribution.

892
01:20:26,702 --> 01:20:28,806
- COMPUTER VOICE: Device activated.
- What's going on?

893
01:20:28,816 --> 01:20:30,930
Believe it or not,
I forgot the damn code.

894
01:20:30,972 --> 01:20:34,200
- What was it? 4-8...
- Detective.

895
01:20:34,210 --> 01:20:39,168
- We can take it from here.
- 2-1-6.

896
01:20:39,209 --> 01:20:40,240
Are you sure about that?

897
01:20:40,292 --> 01:20:41,500
I think Lino, you said it couldn't be 6

898
01:20:41,500 --> 01:20:43,448
because that was the ZIP code
for Brick Mansions.

899
01:20:43,489 --> 01:20:45,395
It will be too much of a coincidence?

900
01:20:45,395 --> 01:20:48,613
You said it was a coincidence.
I said they wanted to blow us up.

901
01:20:48,665 --> 01:20:50,873
Yeah, I think all that jumping around
rooftops has us losing it.

902
01:20:50,883 --> 01:20:53,872
You hit your head one too many times.
You're having a hard time to remember.

903
01:20:53,914 --> 01:20:55,851
Gentleman, thank you very
much, we'll take it...

904
01:20:55,893 --> 01:20:58,038
I'm pretty sure the last number is 6.

905
01:20:58,048 --> 01:21:03,078
Mr. Mayor, you want to press the button?
Or does my man Damien have to do it.

906
01:21:03,078 --> 01:21:05,369
- Go for it man.
- Give it a push.

907
01:21:07,463 --> 01:21:10,483
Stop! Stop! Enough!

908
01:21:11,493 --> 01:21:15,586
What the hell happened out there?
You had a direct order.

909
01:21:15,627 --> 01:21:16,867
You played me
just like you played my father.

910
01:21:16,877 --> 01:21:20,834
Yeah, and your empathy made you soft,
just like your father.

911
01:21:20,876 --> 01:21:23,021
I have to make the
tough decision for the city.

912
01:21:23,032 --> 01:21:25,177
And I sent this bomb in there

913
01:21:25,292 --> 01:21:28,166
to get rid of it's problems.

914
01:21:28,312 --> 01:21:31,405
Come on. You know it.

915
01:21:32,415 --> 01:21:34,456
They're no better than animals.

916
01:21:34,560 --> 01:21:38,663
Animals? Who's animals?
Men who struggled to survive?

917
01:21:38,663 --> 01:21:42,860
Or men who will destoy a whole community,
underprivileged women and children?

918
01:21:45,057 --> 01:21:51,243
As a Mayor, I have to do what's best
for all the people of the city.

919
01:21:51,243 --> 01:21:53,191
- The hardworking ones...
- You mean the rich ones?

920
01:21:53,222 --> 01:21:55,367
The ones that contribute.

921
01:21:55,378 --> 01:21:59,481
The ones that are sick and tired
of that cesspool.

922
01:21:59,481 --> 01:22:02,668
Cesspool?
You need to wake up my man.

923
01:22:02,678 --> 01:22:06,594
- The people are rising up.
- And the people...

924
01:22:07,958 --> 01:22:11,843
Check this out.
They're sick of you.

925
01:22:23,423 --> 01:22:26,401
Catch it on the news in about 5 minutes.

926
01:22:28,703 --> 01:22:32,827
(LAUGHING)

927
01:22:42,220 --> 01:22:45,438
The Mayor of Detroit was arrested today
after a compromising video posted online

928
01:22:45,449 --> 01:22:49,406
appeared to show him plotting an attack
on Brick Mansions residence.

929
01:22:49,417 --> 01:22:51,666
(MAYOR ON THE TAPE)
"And I sent this bomb in there."

930
01:22:51,708 --> 01:22:54,821
The demolition of walls that divide
the city from the Brick Mansions project

931
01:22:54,832 --> 01:22:56,665
will begin next month.

932
01:22:56,748 --> 01:22:58,727
With no date set for new election,

933
01:22:58,727 --> 01:23:02,851
the acting Mayor announced plans to reopen
schools, hospitals and police stations...

934
01:23:42,685 --> 01:23:45,778
Up, up, up.
That was really good.

935
01:23:45,778 --> 01:23:47,881
- (HONKING)
- Go, go, go.

936
01:23:50,818 --> 01:23:52,922
(WHISTLING)

937
01:23:53,067 --> 01:23:56,254
- Yeah man.
- Yo, Sheriff. What a surprise.

938
01:23:56,265 --> 01:23:58,337
- No more crime to fight around here?
- Yeah.

939
01:23:58,358 --> 01:24:03,284
Well, I see you shared your share of the reward money
very responsibly.

940
01:24:03,284 --> 01:24:04,460
I didn't buy this.
Tremaine gave it to me.

941
01:24:04,502 --> 01:24:05,408
No way.

942
01:24:05,408 --> 01:24:07,418
Yeah, he didn't think it
was right for his image

943
01:24:07,460 --> 01:24:09,532
with the whole
From the People campaign.

944
01:24:09,720 --> 01:24:12,813
- Guys got my vote.
- We're gonna need it.

945
01:24:12,844 --> 01:24:15,895
What about you partner?
I see you still fighting the good fight.

946
01:24:15,906 --> 01:24:19,019
- Only with Lola.
- Lino.

947
01:24:20,102 --> 01:24:23,195
I gotta go, you're making
me uncomfortable.

948
01:24:23,195 --> 01:24:25,341
- Easy partner.
- He's just jealous.

949
01:24:25,351 --> 01:24:28,465
- You guys.
- Hey, on three.

950
01:24:29,350 --> 01:24:31,527
Three.
