[scoffs]

6
00:01:13,449 --> 00:01:15,993
- It stopped.
- What's that, Dave?

7
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:18,037
Nothing. How we doing?

8
00:01:18,204 --> 00:01:19,330
Oh, we're ready.

9
00:01:19,497 --> 00:01:22,708
- You, uh, feeling the magic?
- Oh, I'm feeling the magic, all right.

10
00:01:22,875 --> 00:01:24,502
- Let's hit 'em.
- Yeah.

11
00:01:24,668 --> 00:01:26,879
- Let's do it.
- Here we go.

12
00:01:27,046 --> 00:01:30,591
- Let's hit 'em.
- Let's go make $30 million.

13
00:01:35,471 --> 00:01:37,098
[Dave] Good morning.

14
00:01:38,307 --> 00:01:40,684
Before I begin, let me...

15
00:01:47,066 --> 00:01:48,943
[all murmuring]

16
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:51,195
- David?
- I'll go get help.

17
00:01:51,362 --> 00:01:53,781
- [horns honking, brakes screeching]
- Jesus. Jesus, David.

18
00:01:53,948 --> 00:01:55,491
- [cars crashing]
- Phone 911. Phone 911!

19
00:01:55,658 --> 00:01:57,076
[woman] David?

20
00:01:58,452 --> 00:02:00,621
[crashing continues]

21
00:02:00,788 --> 00:02:02,998
[people screaming]

22
00:02:05,751 --> 00:02:07,920
[man] Nick? Nicky?!

23
00:02:08,087 --> 00:02:09,505
N icky!

24
00:02:09,672 --> 00:02:11,799
[screams continue]

25
00:02:24,603 --> 00:02:26,355
[sirens approaching]

26
00:02:33,154 --> 00:02:34,864
[man 1] OK.

27
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:37,533
[man 2] It's OK, it's OK.
You'll be OK.

28
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:39,326
Get everybody else off the bus.

29
00:02:40,578 --> 00:02:42,454
[ticking continues]

30
00:02:45,541 --> 00:02:48,252
[man 3] Sound waves.

31
00:02:49,587 --> 00:02:51,130
So...

32
00:02:51,297 --> 00:02:55,259
...if we know that sound waves
gain wavelength...

33
00:02:55,426 --> 00:02:56,552
[writing on chalkboard]

34
00:02:56,719 --> 00:02:59,263
...and lose frequency

35
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:02,266
as they travel
through more dense materials...

36
00:03:04,143 --> 00:03:06,562
...then the anomalies in these waves...

37
00:03:08,355 --> 00:03:11,025
...are the means
by which we can surmise

38
00:03:11,192 --> 00:03:12,610
the fundamental architecture
of our planet.

39
00:03:16,155 --> 00:03:19,074
- How are the nails coming, Christine?
- [laughter]

40
00:03:20,117 --> 00:03:24,038
Good. All right,
let's have a demonstration.

41
00:03:24,205 --> 00:03:27,541
Mr. Acker, Veronica.
Thank you very much.

42
00:03:28,709 --> 00:03:30,211
[blows loud note]

43
00:03:30,377 --> 00:03:34,632
All right. Mrs. Limestone,
being a big softie, you know,

44
00:03:34,798 --> 00:03:37,801
loves walks in the park, bedtime
stories, big romantic. Loves Chet.

45
00:03:37,968 --> 00:03:40,012
I can't play Chet,
but I'll see what I can do.

46
00:03:40,179 --> 00:03:42,848
Watch the oscilloscope, all right?

47
00:03:43,015 --> 00:03:44,600
Here we go.

48
00:03:45,226 --> 00:03:47,394
[playing off-key]

49
00:03:49,146 --> 00:03:50,356
[clears throat]

50
00:03:52,775 --> 00:03:55,611
- Dr. Joshua Keyes?
- Maybe.

51
00:03:55,778 --> 00:03:59,281
- Yes or no, sir?
- The first one.

52
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:01,033
Please come with us, sir.

53
00:04:04,662 --> 00:04:08,249
- [stammers] Guys, what's going on?
- We don't know, sir.

54
00:04:08,415 --> 00:04:10,334
What do you mean, you don't know?

55
00:04:10,501 --> 00:04:13,170
Your security clearance
is higher than ours.

56
00:04:13,337 --> 00:04:14,922
I have security clearance?

57
00:04:15,089 --> 00:04:18,133
We're just here to
bring you to your jet.

58
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:19,343
I have a jet?

59
00:04:31,355 --> 00:04:33,440
[man speaking French]

60
00:04:36,402 --> 00:04:38,153
Hey, Serge.

61
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,197
Serge. Serge.

62
00:04:40,364 --> 00:04:44,368
Damn! It's about time.
You're always late.

63
00:04:45,577 --> 00:04:47,204
Let's keep moving, gentlemen.

64
00:04:47,371 --> 00:04:50,708
What am I doing here? They wouldn't
brief me until you got here.

65
00:04:50,874 --> 00:04:54,712
You know, there are biochemists
everywhere, military. I hate them.

66
00:04:54,878 --> 00:04:57,548
When are you going to meet a nice girl
and bring her for dinner?

67
00:04:57,715 --> 00:05:00,175
- I'm married to my work.
- So am I.

68
00:05:00,342 --> 00:05:04,430
Which makes my wife my mistress.
That's why I'm still in love with her.

69
00:05:05,597 --> 00:05:08,142
- You were always a romantic.
- I love my wife.

70
00:05:08,309 --> 00:05:11,145
- Yeah, I know. I love your wife, too.
- I know.

71
00:05:11,312 --> 00:05:13,230
But I don't love your wife.
You know what I mean.

72
00:05:13,397 --> 00:05:14,398
You don't love her
the same way, you know.

73
00:05:14,565 --> 00:05:16,358
It's the French.
I think it's the cheese.

74
00:05:16,525 --> 00:05:18,235
- Ah, the cheese.
- [both laugh]

75
00:05:18,402 --> 00:05:22,156
- You're... you're teasing me, right?
- Oh, my...!

76
00:05:22,323 --> 00:05:23,991
Whoa. Wait, these are bodies.

77
00:05:24,158 --> 00:05:25,784
I think we're
in the wrong place here.

78
00:05:25,951 --> 00:05:28,412
- Yeah, we're in the wrong place.
- [man] No.

79
00:05:28,579 --> 00:05:31,165
If you were in the wrong place,
you would've already been shot.

80
00:05:31,332 --> 00:05:34,918
- That's a hell of a greeting.
- Serge.

81
00:05:35,085 --> 00:05:37,504
- Serge.
- Serge. Yes. Always a pleasure.

82
00:05:37,671 --> 00:05:39,673
Same here, Thomas.
Dr. Keyes.

83
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:42,343
I know. Tom Purcell.

84
00:05:42,843 --> 00:05:45,012
Gentlemen, you do realise
that everything here

85
00:05:45,179 --> 00:05:47,389
is totally classified, OK?

86
00:05:50,517 --> 00:05:52,644
At 10.30 a.m. local time,

87
00:05:52,811 --> 00:05:55,773
32 civilians,
all within a ten-block radius...

88
00:05:56,648 --> 00:05:57,858
...died.

89
00:05:58,359 --> 00:05:59,693
They didn't get sick first.

90
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:03,447
- They simply hit the ground dead.
- Nerve agent?

91
00:06:03,614 --> 00:06:05,699
- [Tom] Our first guess. No.
- They all died at the same time?

92
00:06:05,866 --> 00:06:08,077
[Tom] As far as we can tell,
to the second.

93
00:06:08,243 --> 00:06:10,621
This hits CNN in one hour.
I need a reason.

94
00:06:10,788 --> 00:06:13,332
[Serge] Is there a variation
in sex, age, body type?

95
00:06:13,499 --> 00:06:15,167
They all had pacemakers.

96
00:06:15,918 --> 00:06:19,380
Under a minute.
Your reputation is well-deserved.

97
00:06:21,298 --> 00:06:23,258
- Hey, hey, hey.
- [Tom] How did you guess,

98
00:06:23,425 --> 00:06:25,719
- without any clues from the victims?
- No, that's...

99
00:06:25,886 --> 00:06:27,262
Serge and I are the clues.

100
00:06:27,429 --> 00:06:30,557
I mean, he specialises in high energy
weapons. I do geomagnetics.

101
00:06:30,724 --> 00:06:34,269
So calling us means you suspect
an electromagnetic pulse weapon.

102
00:06:34,436 --> 00:06:38,148
If these are the only fatalities,
they must be people susceptible to...

103
00:06:38,315 --> 00:06:41,026
- ...electronic interference.
- QED pacemakers.

104
00:06:41,193 --> 00:06:43,779
- You're spooky sometimes?
- [Tom] Now, I need to know,

105
00:06:44,363 --> 00:06:46,156
did some sort of weapon
kill these people?

106
00:06:46,323 --> 00:06:49,034
The power that you would need
to create an EM pulse strong enough...

107
00:06:49,201 --> 00:06:51,120
I mean, that's... that's not a weapon
that I've ever heard of.

108
00:06:51,286 --> 00:06:54,123
- No.
- OK, we're done.

109
00:06:55,374 --> 00:06:58,669
We're not done, sir. There's nothing
on the other side of the equal sign.

110
00:06:58,836 --> 00:07:00,712
- I agree with Joshua...
- Thank you.

111
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:02,965
Our greatest concern was this
may have been an act of war,

112
00:07:03,132 --> 00:07:06,844
but since it's not, I think we can all
breathe a little easier, can't we?

113
00:07:08,178 --> 00:07:09,763
[door opens]

114
00:07:13,475 --> 00:07:14,935
[cooing]

115
00:07:25,612 --> 00:07:27,906
- Look at my hat.
- [child squeals]

116
00:07:33,454 --> 00:07:35,789
What is it, sweetheart?

117
00:07:36,582 --> 00:07:38,417
[pained cooing]

118
00:07:43,088 --> 00:07:45,841
It's OK, son. These things
happen all the time...

119
00:07:46,008 --> 00:07:47,509
[birds squawking]

120
00:07:56,059 --> 00:07:57,352
Let's go, let's go! Come on!

121
00:08:04,276 --> 00:08:06,278
[screams]

122
00:08:06,445 --> 00:08:08,989
- [thudding]
- [people shouting]

123
00:08:10,866 --> 00:08:12,826
- [squawking continues]
- [people screaming]

124
00:08:14,077 --> 00:08:14,912
Justin!

125
00:08:18,248 --> 00:08:20,501
You bloody idiot!

126
00:08:25,547 --> 00:08:27,925
- [boy] Hurry! Run!
- [screaming continues]

127
00:08:33,055 --> 00:08:35,307
- [grunts]
- [tires screech]

128
00:08:36,975 --> 00:08:38,393
[both grunt]

129
00:08:46,568 --> 00:08:48,487

130
00:08:52,824 --> 00:08:53,951

131
00:09:08,674 --> 00:09:10,717
[Child] Daddy!

132

[sobs]

133
00:09:22,229 --> 00:09:24,565
<i>[man on TV] The skies are empty
over Nelson's Column now,</i>

134
00:09:24,731 --> 00:09:26,984
<i>but a few hours ago,
it was a different story.</i>

135
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:29,820
<i>Eyewitnesses claimed that
the frenzied swarms of birds</i>

136
00:09:29,987 --> 00:09:31,697
<i>were not in fact attacking
people deliberately...</i>

137
00:09:31,863 --> 00:09:34,533
And it's not just this time.
No,no,no,no,no,no.

138
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:37,494
The Fortean <i>Times</i> reported
violent bird swarms

139
00:09:37,661 --> 00:09:40,914
twice last month in Australia and Japan.

140
00:09:41,081 --> 00:09:44,793
<i>...this bizarre and terrifying incident
in London's historic Trafalgar Square.</i>

141
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:46,044
- Weird.
- Mm-hm.

142
00:09:46,211 --> 00:09:48,463
- Quite strange, also.
- Mm. Strange, indeed.

143
00:09:53,051 --> 00:09:56,221
- How do birds navigate?
- [woman] By sight?

144
00:09:56,388 --> 00:09:59,725
- No, no, no, the long range stuff.
- [woman] Magnetic fields.

145
00:09:59,891 --> 00:10:03,228
Little ions in their brains align
with the magnetic field of the Earth.

146
00:10:03,395 --> 00:10:06,690
- Yeah, what she said.
- Right?

147
00:10:06,857 --> 00:10:11,153
Acker. Hit the Net, do a search for,
oh, two years ought to do it.

148
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:14,364
Any and all, like, "weird news,"
you know, bizarre animal migrations,

149
00:10:14,531 --> 00:10:17,284
specifically birds.
Whale and dolphin beachings.

150
00:10:17,451 --> 00:10:20,287
Uh, unusual atmospheric phenomenon,
unexplained plane crashes,

151
00:10:20,454 --> 00:10:23,206
- you know, just use your imagination.
- That is a huge search.

152
00:10:23,373 --> 00:10:26,418
You can use our T-1 line to look up
Sailor Moon crap. You're up to this.

153
00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:30,213
Danni, Danni, get me the brightest kids
from the Field Theory class

154
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:32,382
and design a computer model
of an electromagnetic field.

155
00:10:32,549 --> 00:10:34,718
- What are we doing?
- I need a 3-D computer model

156
00:10:34,885 --> 00:10:36,845
- of the Earth to lay the field over.
- Whoa, the planet Earth?

157
00:10:37,012 --> 00:10:39,514
Yeah, the planet Earth.
You know, the pretty blue one.

158
00:10:40,223 --> 00:10:43,393
Map out the anomalies that Acker finds
and grunt out the equations.

159
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:47,314
And... grab those smelly kids
from the Non-Linear Diff class, too.

160
00:10:47,481 --> 00:10:48,982
Listen, Josh, do we even
have time for this?

161
00:10:49,149 --> 00:10:51,401
Do this and I'll sign
your doctorates blindfolded.

162
00:10:51,568 --> 00:10:53,695
- [Danni] Blindfolded?
- Blindfolded. Do not pass Go.

163
00:10:53,862 --> 00:10:55,906
Go directly to PhD.

164
00:11:00,702 --> 00:11:04,539
Be wrong. Be wrong.

165
00:11:53,797 --> 00:11:55,716
[typing on keyboard]

166
00:12:00,512 --> 00:12:03,306
Tim, I'm coming in a little hot.
Give me some drag, will you?

167
00:12:03,473 --> 00:12:04,766
Roger that.

168
00:12:07,477 --> 00:12:09,146
[clears throat]

169
00:12:13,817 --> 00:12:16,653
We are in attitude and ready
for entry interface.

170
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:18,447
Nice work, Major.

171
00:12:18,613 --> 00:12:20,866
I have the controls now for E.I.

172
00:12:21,032 --> 00:12:23,160
I could take us in.

173
00:12:23,326 --> 00:12:25,662
You could... but you won't.

174
00:12:25,829 --> 00:12:29,666
- I'm ready for this, Bob.
- Oh, no, you're not, Beck.

175
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:33,628
You're trained, and you're certified.
Doesn't make you the commander.

176
00:12:33,795 --> 00:12:36,173
And the commander lands the bird.
You got to be the youngest person

177
00:12:36,339 --> 00:12:39,342
ever in space. You should say,
thank you, be happy. Now.

178
00:12:40,886 --> 00:12:44,473
[man] Endeavour, Houston, at this time
we show you go for re-entry.

179
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:47,058
<i>[Beck] Houston, Endeavour descending
through 400,000 feet</i>

180
00:12:47,225 --> 00:12:50,771
<i>- coming upon entry interface.
- Endeavour, this is Flight.</i>

181
00:12:50,937 --> 00:12:53,565
Weren't able to annoy the commander
into letting you bring her in this time?

182
00:12:53,732 --> 00:12:55,859
That's a negative, Stick. I'll
have to be more annoying next time.

183
00:12:56,026 --> 00:12:57,694
- Is that even possible?
- [laughs]

184
00:12:57,861 --> 00:13:00,489
[man] Endeavour, we see you
in good entry config.

185
00:13:00,655 --> 00:13:01,865
<i>[Beck] Roger, Houston.</i>

186
00:13:05,869 --> 00:13:06,870
<i>[Tim] Advise.</i>

187
00:13:07,037 --> 00:13:09,039
<i>[Bob] I'm seeing
those plasma trails now.</i>

188
00:13:09,206 --> 00:13:11,875
<i>- [Tim] All right, mark 24 and a 1/2.
- [Bob] So, a minute to air.</i>

189
00:13:12,042 --> 00:13:13,710
<i>[Beck] I don't believe in belts.</i>

190
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:20,675
<i>Just get me through the Earth's
atmosphere in this spaceship.</i>

191
00:13:20,842 --> 00:13:23,970
- [beeping]
- Com dropout.

192
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:38,610
<i>- [Tim] Start the I Com.
- [Bob] Let's wait till the, uh...</i>

193
00:13:39,361 --> 00:13:40,487
Com restored.

194
00:13:43,198 --> 00:13:45,116
[alarm beeping]

195
00:13:48,495 --> 00:13:51,081
- [chattering]
- Quiet!

196
00:13:57,254 --> 00:13:58,755
We are out of position here.

197
00:13:58,922 --> 00:14:00,632
Guidance shows us on energy
and on course.

198
00:14:00,799 --> 00:14:03,468
Well, I've made this approach
213 times in the simulator.

199
00:14:03,635 --> 00:14:05,345
- We're not where we should be.
- Where the hell are we?

200
00:14:07,013 --> 00:14:09,349
[Stick] Endeavour, guidance is bad.

201
00:14:09,516 --> 00:14:12,102
You are now 1-2-niner miles off course.

202
00:14:12,269 --> 00:14:14,437
Roger, Houston.
We sort of noticed. Is that...?

203
00:14:14,604 --> 00:14:16,523
Los Angeles. That is confirmed.

204
00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:19,025
We are 1-5 thousand feet.

205
00:14:19,192 --> 00:14:21,069
We got maybe two minutes
of glide time left.

206
00:14:21,236 --> 00:14:23,280
Doesn't make sense. The guidance,
the beacons are all wrong?

207
00:14:23,446 --> 00:14:26,032
We're heading straight for downtown.

208
00:14:26,199 --> 00:14:27,742
We're not gonna crash
into Los Angeles.

209
00:14:27,909 --> 00:14:30,328
They're going to hit
downtown LA at 300 knots.

210
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:35,000
Bob, you know LA?
Because I have an idea.

211
00:14:35,166 --> 00:14:37,127
Houston, those buildings
are getting mighty big.

212
00:14:37,294 --> 00:14:40,589
- Can you clear a freeway?
- OK, thank you.

213
00:14:40,755 --> 00:14:42,132
Come on. Come on.

214
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:46,261
It's rush hour, Commander,
and it's bumper-to-bumper.

215
00:14:49,306 --> 00:14:51,474
Sir, I have an alternate.
If you turn to heading 1-7-5...

216
00:14:51,641 --> 00:14:53,059
It's Houston's call. Houston?

217
00:14:55,645 --> 00:14:58,440
- Computers are still plotting.
- Come on.

218
00:15:07,657 --> 00:15:09,451
[rumbling]

219
00:15:09,618 --> 00:15:10,911
[crowd murmuring]

220
00:15:18,293 --> 00:15:19,961
Houston, we are running
out of time here.

221
00:15:20,128 --> 00:15:22,130
- Sir, I have an alternate.
- All right, Beck, what do you got?

222
00:15:22,297 --> 00:15:25,258
Houston, I have coordinates for an
alternate landing site. Can you confirm?

223
00:15:25,425 --> 00:15:27,677
<i>- Endeavour, give them to me.
- I show possible touchdown</i>

224
00:15:27,844 --> 00:15:30,889
<i>at 33-55 north, 1-18-10 west.</i>

225
00:15:33,183 --> 00:15:36,102
- [Stick] Bill?
- It's theoretically possible.

226
00:15:36,269 --> 00:15:38,021
<i>Endeavour, that is confirmed.</i>

227
00:15:38,188 --> 00:15:42,192
<i>Turn right, heading 1-7-5.
Expect visual contact</i>

228
00:15:42,359 --> 00:15:44,611
<i>with Los Angeles River in five seconds.</i>

229
00:15:49,866 --> 00:15:52,869
No, that will not work, Houston.
We got bridges every few hundred yards.

230
00:15:53,036 --> 00:15:54,663
Our wingspan alone
is going to fold us up.

231
00:15:54,829 --> 00:15:56,456
I've figured the "L" over "D" max.

232
00:15:56,623 --> 00:15:58,166
We can make it
if you can bring us straight in.

233
00:15:58,333 --> 00:15:59,417
We're coming in high and hot.

234
00:16:06,091 --> 00:16:07,384
Two-ninety feet, 320.

235
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:09,135
- Two-seventy, 3-0-5...
- Arm the gear.

236
00:16:09,302 --> 00:16:11,304
- [Tim] Gear on.
- Gear down. Now.

237
00:16:11,471 --> 00:16:12,305
[Tim] Gear in transition.

238
00:16:17,602 --> 00:16:19,938
Two-forty feet, 290.

239
00:16:20,105 --> 00:16:22,232
[Bob] Hang on.
This isn't going to be subtle.

240
00:16:24,859 --> 00:16:27,487
Two-ten feet, 265.

241
00:16:28,613 --> 00:16:30,407
Get out of the way! Move!

242
00:16:33,994 --> 00:16:34,995
- Derotate.
- [Bob] Inward.

243
00:16:41,126 --> 00:16:43,461
- 230... 210...
- Speed brakes!

244
00:16:44,921 --> 00:16:46,589
- One hundred per cent.
- [Bob] We're way too fast.

245
00:16:46,756 --> 00:16:48,049
- Deploy the chute.
- No. We'd snag the bridge.

246
00:16:48,216 --> 00:16:49,217
We'll tear the tail off.

247
00:16:52,762 --> 00:16:53,805
Banking right.

248
00:16:59,811 --> 00:17:01,312
[Beck] Commander, that next bridge!

249
00:17:01,479 --> 00:17:03,273
Watch it! We're way too high
for that one!

250
00:17:04,065 --> 00:17:06,026
- Suck up the gear!
- Not yet. We'll lose all steering.

251
00:17:06,192 --> 00:17:07,944
We hit, it's over!

252
00:17:11,614 --> 00:17:13,658
And... gear up now!

253
00:17:19,789 --> 00:17:21,624
Lock your harnesses.
It's out of my hands.

254
00:17:30,091 --> 00:17:31,885
[all shouting]

255
00:17:38,308 --> 00:17:41,853
- Let's get out of here!
- Run! Let's get out!

00:18:25,522 --> 00:18:26,773
[man] Dr. Zimsky?!

262
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:28,566
Will you make sure my assistant
has your number, darling?

263
00:18:28,733 --> 00:18:29,692
Sure.

264
00:18:29,859 --> 00:18:32,278
- Dr. Zimsky!
- Hello. No, it's all right.

265
00:18:32,445 --> 00:18:34,239
- Hello.
- Thank you, sir.

266
00:18:34,405 --> 00:18:35,824
- Dr. Zimsky.
- Yes. What's your name?

267
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:37,283
- Josh Keyes.
- Josh.

268
00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:40,411
No, sir, I don't need you to sign it.
I need you to read that.

269
00:18:40,578 --> 00:18:41,955
[laughs] I'm sorry, I don't have time.

270
00:18:42,122 --> 00:18:44,290
- I'm late for the White House, please.
- Sir...

271
00:18:44,457 --> 00:18:46,251
I need you to confirm my results, sir.

272
00:18:46,417 --> 00:18:48,628
Young man, do you have
any idea who I am?

273
00:18:48,795 --> 00:18:50,880
Yes, I do, sir. Please read this.

274
00:18:51,548 --> 00:18:52,882
[camera clicking]

275
00:18:53,049 --> 00:18:55,093
What's it about?

276
00:18:55,844 --> 00:18:57,428
It's the end of the world.

No, I... this is impossible. I'm sorry.
[laughs]

280
00:19:26,749 --> 00:19:30,253
I... I can't have missed this.
You... You have to be wrong.

281
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:33,006
I mean, look, I'm sure with careful
comparison to my own work,

282
00:19:33,173 --> 00:19:35,884
we'll find that you are mistaken.
No offence, but...

283
00:19:36,050 --> 00:19:37,844
Well, I mean,
we'll know soon enough.

284
00:19:39,095 --> 00:19:41,931
The bigger effects will start up
any day now.

- Only you and Dad ever call me that.

287
00:20:45,787 --> 00:20:47,455
Right, Beck.

288
00:20:47,622 --> 00:20:50,375
So, what brings you to sunny D.C.?

289
00:20:50,541 --> 00:20:52,043
The Board of Review is next week.

290
00:20:54,045 --> 00:20:57,215
Just trying to get a sense
of the mood upstairs.

291
00:20:57,382 --> 00:21:01,094
- How bad is it?
- Your crew crashed the space shuttle.

292
00:21:01,261 --> 00:21:04,013
Now, how good do you
think it could be?

293
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:06,182
- Sir, this is my life.
- Well...

294
00:21:06,349 --> 00:21:08,893
I was studying for the academy
when I was 13.

295
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:11,187
It still is and has
always been my life.

296
00:21:11,354 --> 00:21:13,106
It's over.

297
00:21:14,023 --> 00:21:16,276
It's over, Rebecca.

298
00:21:16,442 --> 00:21:18,027
I'm sorry.

- [man] Really?
- It's like the 4th of July.

301
00:21:22,365 --> 00:21:24,826
- What the hell's the hurry here?
- [cell phone rings]

302
00:21:26,744 --> 00:21:30,665
Rebecca, would you excuse me, please?
Excuse me.

303
00:21:34,210 --> 00:21:38,423
- Purcell.
- Thomas, um, look...

304
00:21:40,383 --> 00:21:43,386
...it seems that destiny
may have caught up with us.

305
00:22:02,947 --> 00:22:06,242
Did Zimsky really try
to give you his autograph?

306
00:22:08,745 --> 00:22:11,247
Ah, Monsieur Zimsky.

307
00:22:11,414 --> 00:22:13,916
Conrad Zimsky. Herr Zimsky.

308
00:22:14,083 --> 00:22:16,002
Superstar.

309
00:22:18,463 --> 00:22:19,922
Ahh. [exhales]

310
00:22:22,008 --> 00:22:24,260
I think I skipped drunk.

311
00:22:24,427 --> 00:22:26,512
Went right to hangover.

312
00:22:26,679 --> 00:22:28,890
[low-tempo music plays]

313
00:22:30,767 --> 00:22:32,643
I spoke with the kids.

314
00:22:32,810 --> 00:22:34,937
They don't sleep at night.

315
00:22:35,104 --> 00:22:39,817
They look at the sky, and...
and they think it's pretty.

316
00:22:41,402 --> 00:22:44,572
- Is there any chance you're wrong?
- No. The sky, man.

317
00:22:44,739 --> 00:22:46,282
The sky... I mean,
that's just the beginning.

318
00:22:46,449 --> 00:22:50,286
- That's high-altitude static discharge.
- I know.

319
00:22:50,453 --> 00:22:52,497
[man] Dr. Keyes...

320
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:56,667
...your presence is
required at the Pentagon.

321
00:22:56,834 --> 00:23:00,713
Ahh! It's my best buddies. Hey!

322
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:02,673
Why don't you join us for a drink?

323
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:05,259
We'd be grateful if you could
join us for a ride, sir.

324
00:23:05,426 --> 00:23:07,136
And if I were to say no?

325
00:23:07,303 --> 00:23:08,596
- Just asking.
- Yeah.

326
00:23:08,763 --> 00:23:12,058
- Well, we have no sense of humour.
- That's true.

327
00:23:13,351 --> 00:23:16,396
- Oh.
- And we're armed.

328
00:23:19,732 --> 00:23:21,025
Thank you.

329
00:23:24,237 --> 00:23:26,656
- [Tom] Dr. Keyes, welcome.
- Thank you.

330
00:23:26,823 --> 00:23:30,076
Dr. Zimsky informs us
that you made a useful contribution

331
00:23:30,243 --> 00:23:33,663
to his investigations, so he wanted you
to assist him with the briefing.

332
00:23:33,830 --> 00:23:36,165
That's very generous of you,
Dr. Zimsky.

333
00:23:36,332 --> 00:23:39,168
Science is a selfless business,
dear boy.

334
00:23:39,335 --> 00:23:43,673
Now, why don't you begin,
and I'll fill in all the difficult bits.

335
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:46,426
[clears throat]

336
00:23:47,009 --> 00:23:50,012
All right, I'll put this
as simply as I can.

337
00:23:50,179 --> 00:23:53,057
[sighs] Everybody on Earth
is dead in a year.

338
00:23:55,476 --> 00:23:56,644
And let me explain why.

339
00:23:56,811 --> 00:24:00,523
Wrapped around the Earth
is an invisible field of energy.

340
00:24:00,690 --> 00:24:03,359
It's made up of
electricity and magnetism,

341
00:24:03,526 --> 00:24:06,821
so it's called, creatively enough,
the electromagnetic field.

342
00:24:06,988 --> 00:24:09,240
It's where we get our magnetic
North Pole and South Pole,

343
00:24:09,407 --> 00:24:12,410
and it protects us
from cosmic radiation.

344
00:24:12,577 --> 00:24:16,205
- So this EM field is our friend.
- But now...?

345
00:24:16,372 --> 00:24:19,292
But now, that field is falling apart.

346
00:24:19,917 --> 00:24:22,211
- Why?
- [scoffs] Why?

347
00:24:24,005 --> 00:24:25,756
This here.

348
00:24:27,633 --> 00:24:30,720
Does somebody have a can
of air freshener?

349
00:24:34,098 --> 00:24:36,309
Uh... Quick and dirty.

350
00:24:37,727 --> 00:24:41,355
The thin skin, that's the Earth's crust.
That's what we live on.

351
00:24:41,522 --> 00:24:43,357
It's 30 miles thick.

352
00:24:43,524 --> 00:24:46,486
The meat here, call it the mantle.

353
00:24:46,652 --> 00:24:50,907
And forgetting all the funky
transitions, it's 2,000 miles thick.

354
00:24:52,575 --> 00:24:56,287
The core, the peach pit
in the centre, that's a tricky one.

355
00:24:56,454 --> 00:24:59,248
There's two parts:
the inner core and the outer core.

356
00:24:59,415 --> 00:25:03,586
Are you following me?
The inner core is...

357
00:25:03,753 --> 00:25:06,756
Well, it's a big solid chunk of iron,
we think.

358
00:25:06,923 --> 00:25:10,259
And that's surrounded by the outer core,
and that is liquid.

359
00:25:10,426 --> 00:25:13,054
Yes, but, most importantly,

360
00:25:13,221 --> 00:25:16,098
this liquid is constantly spinning
in one direction.

361
00:25:16,265 --> 00:25:18,559
So a trillion trillion tons of hot metal

362
00:25:18,726 --> 00:25:22,021
spinning at
a thousand miles an hour, so...

363
00:25:22,188 --> 00:25:23,231
Right, so, Physics 101:

364
00:25:23,397 --> 00:25:25,942
Hot metal moving fast
makes an electromagnetic field.

365
00:25:26,108 --> 00:25:30,363
This spinning liquid outer core
is the engine that drives the EM Field.

366
00:25:31,781 --> 00:25:33,616
And that's where we have our problem.

367
00:25:33,783 --> 00:25:35,618
This engine has stalled.

368
00:25:35,785 --> 00:25:39,288
The core of the Earth
has stopped spinning.

369
00:25:40,414 --> 00:25:42,959
- How could this have happened?
- [people murmuring]

370
00:25:44,669 --> 00:25:46,337
We don't know.

371
00:25:49,423 --> 00:25:50,550
What's the timeline here?

372
00:25:51,551 --> 00:25:53,427
As the EM Field
becomes more and more unstable,

373
00:25:53,594 --> 00:25:55,263
we'll start seeing isolated incidents.

374
00:25:55,429 --> 00:25:58,057
One plane will fall from the sky,
and then two, and then...

375
00:25:58,224 --> 00:26:01,477
...in a few months, anything,
everything electronic will be fried.

376
00:26:01,644 --> 00:26:04,981
Static discharges in the atmosphere
will create superstorms

377
00:26:05,147 --> 00:26:07,567
with hundreds of lightning strikes
per square mile.

378
00:26:07,733 --> 00:26:09,485
After that, it gets bad.

379
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:14,865
The Earth's EM Field
shields us from the solar winds,

380
00:26:15,032 --> 00:26:19,495
which are a lethal blend of radioactive
particles and microwaves.

381
00:26:19,662 --> 00:26:22,999
When that shield collapses,
microwave radiation

382
00:26:23,165 --> 00:26:27,545
will literally cook our planet.

383
00:26:28,087 --> 00:26:29,171
Dr. Zimsky.

384
00:26:30,089 --> 00:26:32,967
- [clears throat]
- This is the sun.

385
00:26:34,051 --> 00:26:37,972
This is the Earth...
without the EM Field.

386
00:26:38,139 --> 00:26:39,599
- Would you?
- Mm-hm.

387
00:26:49,692 --> 00:26:52,862
Three months, gentlemen,
and we're back in the Stone Age.

388
00:26:53,029 --> 00:26:56,198
A full year, the field collapses...

389
00:26:56,365 --> 00:26:57,700
...and that.

390
00:27:02,872 --> 00:27:03,873
May I?

391
00:27:05,541 --> 00:27:07,960
Feel free to throw up.
I know I did.

392
00:27:09,253 --> 00:27:12,089
So... how do we fix it?

393
00:27:12,256 --> 00:27:14,175
- We can't.
- Not in my vocabulary.

394
00:27:14,342 --> 00:27:15,551
Then you might want
to get one of those

395
00:27:15,718 --> 00:27:18,220
word-a-day calendars, General,
because it's impossible.

396
00:27:18,387 --> 00:27:21,140
The core is the size of Mars. You're
talking about jumpstarting a planet.

397
00:27:21,307 --> 00:27:23,392
This is a superheated hyper-fluid

398
00:27:23,559 --> 00:27:26,103
of molten iron and nickel
at 9,000 degrees Fahrenheit,

399
00:27:26,270 --> 00:27:29,231
2,000 miles down, 1,000 miles thick.

400
00:27:29,398 --> 00:27:33,194
And the deepest we've ever been
is... seven miles

401
00:27:33,361 --> 00:27:35,613
- with a two-inch drill bit.
- If we can go into space,

402
00:27:35,780 --> 00:27:38,240
- we certainly...
- Well, space is easy. It's empty.

403
00:27:38,407 --> 00:27:41,077
We're talking about millions of pounds
of pressure per square inch.

404
00:27:42,203 --> 00:27:43,996
Even if we somehow
came up with a brilliant plan

405
00:27:44,163 --> 00:27:47,375
to fix the core,
we just can't get there.

406
00:27:48,584 --> 00:27:50,169
[Zimsky] Yes, but...

407
00:27:55,758 --> 00:27:57,176
...what if we could?

408
00:28:49,019 --> 00:28:51,147
Hello, Braz.

409
00:28:53,607 --> 00:28:55,401
Why the hell aren't you dead yet?

410
00:28:56,819 --> 00:28:58,112
OK, this way.

411
00:29:00,823 --> 00:29:03,117
Oh. That went better than I expected.

412
00:29:03,284 --> 00:29:05,619
Dr. Brazzelton,
I see you know Dr. Zimsky.

413
00:29:05,786 --> 00:29:09,415
Yeah. Twenty years ago,
he stole my research. [laughs]

414
00:29:09,582 --> 00:29:13,794
- After that, we kind of lost touch.
- Research that was equally mine.

415
00:29:13,961 --> 00:29:16,005
That's funny, I don't remember a cheque
from any of the patents.

416
00:29:16,172 --> 00:29:17,923
[sighing] All right, Braz,

417
00:29:18,090 --> 00:29:21,969
20 years in the desert
makes you a prophet and a martyr.

418
00:29:22,136 --> 00:29:24,555
Look, we're here
about your legendary ship.

419
00:29:24,722 --> 00:29:29,226
OK, I'm combining
high-frequency pulse lasers

420
00:29:29,393 --> 00:29:31,395
with resonance tube ultrasonics.

421
00:29:31,562 --> 00:29:34,440
If you've ever seen ultrasonic waves
break up a kidney stone

422
00:29:34,607 --> 00:29:36,942
on the Discovery Channel,
it's the same deal here.

423
00:29:37,109 --> 00:29:40,738
- Uh, you can put your helmets on now.
- [motor starting]

424
00:29:41,614 --> 00:29:43,365
- Firing.
- [powering up]

425
00:30:00,257 --> 00:30:01,884
[shouting]

426
00:30:06,013 --> 00:30:08,265
[shouting]

427
00:30:10,851 --> 00:30:12,895
[engine powering down]

428
00:30:15,189 --> 00:30:17,858
[Braz] Yeah. Oh.

429
00:30:20,069 --> 00:30:22,488
[coughing]

430
00:30:26,408 --> 00:30:27,910
[Spits]

431
00:30:30,788 --> 00:30:34,083
OK, I'm officially impressed.

432
00:30:41,465 --> 00:30:42,800
[Zimsky] Well, all right.

433
00:30:42,967 --> 00:30:46,679
So you've made some progress
with the engine, I will grant you.

434
00:30:47,596 --> 00:30:50,182
Uh, have you begun
to think about a shell?

435
00:30:50,349 --> 00:30:53,853
OK, this is Alex.

436
00:30:54,019 --> 00:30:55,521
OK, Alex. Good.

437
00:30:56,564 --> 00:30:58,649
OK, here we have a concrete block,

438
00:30:59,275 --> 00:31:03,237
and in back of that,
we have a two-inch steel plate.

439
00:31:06,365 --> 00:31:08,951
- [engine powering up]
- OK. We're ready.

440
00:31:14,039 --> 00:31:17,376
And we are... firing.

441
00:31:30,681 --> 00:31:32,099
[engine powering down]

442
00:31:37,187 --> 00:31:39,690
- Voilà!
- That's...

443
00:31:41,317 --> 00:31:44,236
- That's impossible.
- [Braz] I combined the crystals

444
00:31:44,403 --> 00:31:47,948
in a tungsten-titanium matrix
at supercool temperatures,

445
00:31:48,574 --> 00:31:50,659
and that's what did the trick.

446
00:31:50,826 --> 00:31:53,120
The applications for this are just...

447
00:31:53,287 --> 00:31:55,497
What do you call this material?

448
00:31:55,664 --> 00:31:58,334
Well, its real name has 37 syllables.

449
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:01,128
I call it Unobtanium.

450
00:32:01,295 --> 00:32:02,922
- Unobtanium?
- Mm-hm.

451
00:32:03,088 --> 00:32:06,383
The Unobtanium will take
the heat and the pressure

452
00:32:06,550 --> 00:32:07,927
and transform it to energy,

453
00:32:08,093 --> 00:32:10,220
which in turn, reinforces
the shell of the ship, you see.

454
00:32:10,387 --> 00:32:13,891
So the hotter and the deeper she gets,
the stronger she gets, theoretically.

455
00:32:14,058 --> 00:32:16,936
- [Zimsky] Theoretically?
- Theoretically, yes.

456
00:32:17,102 --> 00:32:20,773
This... is Johnson, don't mind him.

457
00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:24,318
This is the prototype
for the cockpit here.

458
00:32:24,485 --> 00:32:27,738
Excuse me, Dr. Brazzelton, when do you
think the ship will be operational?

459
00:32:27,905 --> 00:32:31,367
When I get my fabrication
methods perfected.

460
00:32:32,034 --> 00:32:35,037
Twelve... ten years, ten years.

461
00:32:35,204 --> 00:32:37,831
What would it take to get
it done in three months?

462
00:32:40,292 --> 00:32:43,087
[laughing] Fifteen billion dollars. I...

463
00:32:45,798 --> 00:32:47,549
Will you take a cheque?

464
00:32:48,592 --> 00:32:50,594
Why don't you use a credit card?
You get miles.

465
00:32:50,761 --> 00:32:52,137
Mm.

466
00:32:54,139 --> 00:32:55,808
[pounding]

467
00:32:56,934 --> 00:32:59,812
- [man 1] Shit!
- [man 2] Mr. Finch, this is the FBI.

468
00:32:59,979 --> 00:33:02,356
- We have a warrant.
- [pounding continues]

469
00:33:06,235 --> 00:33:07,987
- [Finch] Purge!
- [Computers beeping]

470
00:33:10,739 --> 00:33:12,116
Come on, purge!

471
00:33:25,170 --> 00:33:27,131
FBI! Freeze!

472
00:33:28,966 --> 00:33:29,967
[dings]

473
00:33:35,347 --> 00:33:36,974
[clattering]

474
00:33:37,141 --> 00:33:39,101
OK.

475
00:33:39,268 --> 00:33:43,647
I know these look like computers.
Totally not.

476
00:33:43,814 --> 00:33:47,943
Theodore Donald Finch.
Carnegie Mellon University. MIT.

477
00:33:48,110 --> 00:33:50,112
Worked at Sun, Lucent, RAND Corp.

478
00:33:50,279 --> 00:33:52,489
My handle's "Rat". Call me Rat.

479
00:33:52,656 --> 00:33:54,408
Sixty-three computer fraud indictments.

480
00:33:54,575 --> 00:33:56,285
Sixty-four.

481
00:33:57,453 --> 00:33:59,371
Two convictions.

482
00:33:59,538 --> 00:34:01,707
This is strike three, Mr. Finch.

483
00:34:01,874 --> 00:34:03,125
Wait a second.

484
00:34:03,292 --> 00:34:05,544
You guys aren't here
to whack me, are you?

485
00:34:05,711 --> 00:34:09,590
Because I was really, really hoping
to have sex before that happened.

486
00:34:09,757 --> 00:34:14,803
Yeah. I've been told by the FBI,
whose database you crippled last year,

487
00:34:14,970 --> 00:34:18,307
that you are the best in the business.
So you're about to be given a choice.

488
00:34:18,474 --> 00:34:21,643
- What if I say no?
- Excuse me, but

489
00:34:21,810 --> 00:34:24,688
is this really the best we could do?
I mean...

490
00:34:24,855 --> 00:34:28,400
- How many languages do you speak?
- Five, actually.

491
00:34:28,567 --> 00:34:32,488
Well, I speak one.
One, zero, one, zero, zero.

492
00:34:32,654 --> 00:34:36,492
With that, I could steal
your money, your secrets,

493
00:34:36,658 --> 00:34:38,994
your sexual fantasies, your whole life,

494
00:34:39,161 --> 00:34:43,457
any country, any place,
anytime I want.

495
00:34:43,624 --> 00:34:45,000
We multitask like you breathe.

496
00:34:46,376 --> 00:34:48,212
I couldn't think
as slow as you if I tried.

497
00:34:51,757 --> 00:34:54,093
- Do you have any idea...?
- OK, hey. Hey!

498
00:34:54,259 --> 00:34:56,929
Let's just, let's give the kid a break.

499
00:34:59,223 --> 00:35:02,434
OK, it's a phone. It's just a phone.

500
00:35:04,311 --> 00:35:06,230
Rat...

501
00:35:06,396 --> 00:35:09,900
...we got a big... problem.

502
00:35:10,067 --> 00:35:12,069
A lot of people are going to die.

503
00:35:12,236 --> 00:35:14,196
- We need your help.
- What kind of help?

504
00:35:14,363 --> 00:35:15,697
- [blows on wrapper]
- Information control.

505
00:35:15,864 --> 00:35:18,408
We need you to control the flow
of information on the Internet.

506
00:35:18,575 --> 00:35:20,911
You're dreaming.
Nobody controls the Net.

507
00:35:21,078 --> 00:35:24,790
Could you... with unlimited resources?

508
00:35:25,666 --> 00:35:27,417
You want me to hack the planet?

509
00:35:27,584 --> 00:35:29,086
[chuckles]

510
00:35:29,545 --> 00:35:31,380
- [dialing phone]
- He wants me to hack the planet.

511
00:35:31,547 --> 00:35:32,840
[blowing sounds]

512
00:35:33,006 --> 00:35:35,759
[phone dialing]

513
00:35:37,469 --> 00:35:41,181
You've got free long distance
on that phone... forever.

514
00:35:42,766 --> 00:35:46,520
OK. If I decide to do this,

515
00:35:46,687 --> 00:35:49,273
I'm going to need
an unlimited supply

516
00:35:49,439 --> 00:35:52,025
of Xena tapes and Hot Pockets.

517
00:35:52,776 --> 00:35:55,821
- Hot Pockets?
- They help me concentrate.

518
00:35:56,780 --> 00:35:58,323
Sounds fair.

519
00:35:58,991 --> 00:36:00,701
[shoes squeaking]

520
00:36:05,581 --> 00:36:07,207
[door opens]

521
00:36:07,791 --> 00:36:10,085
[man] Major Childs,
they're ready for you.

522
00:36:13,005 --> 00:36:14,006
[swallows]

523
00:36:14,173 --> 00:36:17,718
Major Childs, a clarification:

524
00:36:17,885 --> 00:36:19,219
You and you alone were responsible

525
00:36:19,386 --> 00:36:21,722
for proposing the descent vectors
for the shuttle, correct?

526
00:36:22,931 --> 00:36:24,308
Yes, General.

527
00:36:24,474 --> 00:36:26,727
[General] We have determined
that the Class "A" landing mishap

528
00:36:26,894 --> 00:36:28,228
experienced by the Shuttle Endeavour

529
00:36:28,395 --> 00:36:31,982
was caused by biased navigational data
from the ground

530
00:36:32,149 --> 00:36:34,735
due to a brief geomagnetic disturbance.

531
00:36:34,902 --> 00:36:37,237
Major Childs,
the resourcefulness you showed

532
00:36:37,404 --> 00:36:39,114
in determining
the descent vectors proved

533
00:36:39,281 --> 00:36:42,868
that you have exceptional
navigational skills.

534
00:36:43,035 --> 00:36:44,953
You've brought much credit
upon yourself,

535
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:48,165
the space programme
and the United States Air Force.

536
00:36:48,332 --> 00:36:50,042
Congratulations, Major.

537
00:36:50,959 --> 00:36:54,630
You are reassigned with Commander
Iverson and Flight Director Stickley

538
00:36:54,796 --> 00:36:57,216
to a new mission, effective immediately.

539
00:36:57,382 --> 00:37:02,095
Transportation is waiting outside.
Good luck and Godspeed, Major.

540
00:37:26,328 --> 00:37:28,664
[chattering]

541
00:37:28,830 --> 00:37:30,499
[Serge] Are you sure you want
to wear this tie?

542
00:37:30,666 --> 00:37:32,000
- [Josh] Why?
- [Serge] I don't know.

543
00:37:32,167 --> 00:37:33,919
I mean, you look so nervous about it.

544
00:37:34,086 --> 00:37:36,838
- You look so...
- So, how are you holding up?

545
00:37:37,005 --> 00:37:38,840
- Oh, hi.
- I'm good, I'm good.

546
00:37:39,007 --> 00:37:41,677
I'm about to tell a couple hundred
people the world is going to end.

547
00:37:41,843 --> 00:37:43,679
- Well...
- I've had better days.

548
00:37:43,845 --> 00:37:45,681
You look good.

549
00:37:45,847 --> 00:37:47,391
Well, no, you don't look good.

550
00:37:47,557 --> 00:37:49,518
Why did he touch his tie like that?

551
00:37:50,185 --> 00:37:52,312
Thomas, let me speak
with you for a moment.

552
00:37:52,479 --> 00:37:54,147
Listen, wouldn't you rather I did this?

553
00:37:54,314 --> 00:37:55,732
I mean, given my reputation,
I think that...

554
00:37:55,899 --> 00:37:57,526
No. No, Keyes is in
the lead here, Zimsky.

555
00:37:57,693 --> 00:38:01,196
Yes. Thomas, this is the most important
scientific operation in history.

556
00:38:01,363 --> 00:38:04,032
And given my status,
I feel that it's my job to present...

557
00:38:04,199 --> 00:38:06,535
Project Destiny was your job, Zimsky.

558
00:38:06,702 --> 00:38:08,537
And you went way beyond
authorised limits.

559
00:38:08,704 --> 00:38:10,038
And let me tell... let me tell you,

560
00:38:10,205 --> 00:38:14,209
I still, I want to know
if Destiny caused this problem.

561
00:38:14,376 --> 00:38:17,587
It's highly unlikely,
but it may be the solution.

562
00:38:17,754 --> 00:38:20,173
- Now, I have not finished checking...
- Excuse me.

563
00:38:22,134 --> 00:38:26,096
Rebecca... I'm so glad I was wrong.

564
00:38:26,263 --> 00:38:29,141
Right over left...
No, the other left, the other left.

565
00:38:29,308 --> 00:38:30,475
- Gentlemen.
- And then you...

566
00:38:30,642 --> 00:38:31,852
Gentlemen.

567
00:38:32,019 --> 00:38:36,481
Commander Iverson, Major Childs,
this is your crew:

568
00:38:36,648 --> 00:38:39,359
- Dr. Brazzelton knows the ship.
- Hello.

569
00:38:39,526 --> 00:38:42,487
- [Tom] Dr. Zimsky knows the planet.
- Doctor.

570
00:38:42,654 --> 00:38:44,448
Dr. Leveque knows the weapons system.

571
00:38:44,614 --> 00:38:48,577
- Excuse me, ladies first. Hi.
- [Tom] And Dr. Keyes... [clears throat]

572
00:38:48,744 --> 00:38:50,871
Dr. Keyes built the navigation system.

573
00:38:51,038 --> 00:38:53,165
- So...
- Hi. Rebecca Childs.

574
00:38:53,332 --> 00:38:54,374
Bob Iverson.

575
00:38:54,541 --> 00:38:57,294
These are your fellow... fellow what?

576
00:38:57,461 --> 00:38:59,921
- Terranauts?
- [Stick] Hello.

577
00:39:00,088 --> 00:39:01,340
All this brain power over here

578
00:39:01,506 --> 00:39:03,050
is starting to smell
like burning batteries.

579
00:39:03,216 --> 00:39:05,802
- Y'all better come and join in.
- Yeah.

580
00:39:08,055 --> 00:39:09,431
It's the simplest things
that are the hardest, huh?

581
00:39:09,598 --> 00:39:13,602
Yeah. It's official. I'm the
least-qualified person on this base.

582
00:39:13,769 --> 00:39:16,605
Dr. Keyes, I'm sure the people in charge
have every confidence in you.

583
00:39:16,772 --> 00:39:18,607
Well, the problem is that I'm in charge.

584
00:39:18,774 --> 00:39:21,610
- [chuckles] Yeah, I know.
- Can I help you?

585
00:39:21,777 --> 00:39:23,362
Yes, please.

586
00:39:23,528 --> 00:39:24,821
[clears throat]

587
00:39:25,447 --> 00:39:27,657
You're an astronaut,
and you can tie a Windsor?

588
00:39:27,824 --> 00:39:29,159
Mm-hm.

589
00:39:29,326 --> 00:39:33,789
- Is there anything you can't do?
- Not that I'm aware of.

590
00:39:34,790 --> 00:39:37,042
I find that incredibly intimidating.

591
00:39:37,209 --> 00:39:40,128
Yep. Most people do.

592
00:39:40,295 --> 00:39:42,381
Here.

593
00:39:43,215 --> 00:39:45,133
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

594
00:39:47,052 --> 00:39:51,223
[Tom] Let me introduce our project
leader, Dr. Joshua Keyes.

595
00:39:51,932 --> 00:39:53,934
[Josh] Thank you, thank you.

596
00:39:54,101 --> 00:39:57,646
Good evening. Good evening.

597
00:39:57,813 --> 00:40:02,984
Wow. This looks like a meeting
for Nobel Prize Winners Anonymous.

598
00:40:04,152 --> 00:40:05,987
I know you are all
the finest in your fields

599
00:40:06,154 --> 00:40:08,365
and have come a long way to be here.

600
00:40:08,532 --> 00:40:12,869
So, I'll outline our programme
over the next three months.

601
00:40:16,581 --> 00:40:19,876
<i>Dr. Brazzelton will supervise
the building of a ship</i>

602
00:40:20,043 --> 00:40:22,546
<i>which is capable of reaching
the centre of our planet.</i>

603
00:40:22,712 --> 00:40:24,798
<i>Once there, it will deliver
an explosive charge</i>

604
00:40:24,965 --> 00:40:27,384
<i>large enough to restart its core.</i>

605
00:40:29,469 --> 00:40:33,432
<i>Dr. Zimsky will calculate the scale
of the explosion needed.</i>

606
00:40:33,598 --> 00:40:35,934
[Zimsky] This is a program I designed
to simulate the effect

607
00:40:36,101 --> 00:40:39,020
of nuclear detonations on the core.

608
00:40:39,187 --> 00:40:42,357
If my calculations are correct,
a tiny nudge in any direction

609
00:40:42,524 --> 00:40:44,276
will force the core back
into its normal flow.

610
00:40:44,443 --> 00:40:45,902
What's a "tiny nudge"
in planetary terms?

611
00:40:46,069 --> 00:40:48,738
- A thousand megatons, give or take?
- [Zimsky] Tops.

612
00:40:48,905 --> 00:40:51,324
Because any more than that
would create a core instability.

613
00:40:51,491 --> 00:40:54,202
[Serge] We made a few monster warheads
in the 200-megaton range.

614
00:40:54,369 --> 00:40:57,622
Braz, do you think the ship
can handle five of these babies?

615
00:40:57,789 --> 00:40:58,748
Yeah.

616
00:40:58,915 --> 00:41:01,001
- I can enlarge the ejection pod...
- [Bob] Forgive me,

617
00:41:01,168 --> 00:41:04,212
but, you know, I know
I'm not the expert here,

618
00:41:04,379 --> 00:41:07,007
but what if the core
is thicker or thinner?

619
00:41:07,174 --> 00:41:09,009
I mean, what if it's not
what you think it is?

620
00:41:09,176 --> 00:41:11,052
Isn't that going to affect
the way the explosions are...?

621
00:41:11,219 --> 00:41:15,765
Yes, yes, yes, yes.
And what if the core is made of cheese?

622
00:41:15,932 --> 00:41:20,437
This is all best guess, Commander.
That's all science is, is best guess.

623
00:41:21,771 --> 00:41:23,732
So my best guess is you don't know.

624
00:41:23,899 --> 00:41:26,860
<i>[Josh] With luck, irony will break
for the good guys for once,</i>

625
00:41:27,027 --> 00:41:28,862
<i>and the world's biggest weapons
of mass destruction</i>

626
00:41:29,029 --> 00:41:30,655
<i>will help save the world.</i>

627
00:41:30,822 --> 00:41:34,701
<i>The ship will be powered by a small
experimental nuclear reactor.</i>

628
00:41:34,868 --> 00:41:38,413
<i>It will be divided into six compartments
like cars on a train:</i>

629
00:41:38,580 --> 00:41:40,624
<i>the locomotive unit,
navigation compartment,</i>

630
00:41:40,790 --> 00:41:43,835
<i>living quarters, engineering,
bomb compartment</i>

631
00:41:44,002 --> 00:41:46,338
<i>and finally the weapons-control module.</i>

632
00:41:47,214 --> 00:41:50,467
Up to a 45-degree angle, every
compartment will be held level

633
00:41:50,634 --> 00:41:54,888
by these gyro control gimbals.
But if we do breach a section,

634
00:41:56,056 --> 00:41:57,933
bulkhead doors engage automatically,

635
00:41:58,099 --> 00:42:01,269
seal off the section in red, and eject.

636
00:42:01,436 --> 00:42:04,940
- Is ejection really the best option?
- Only option.

637
00:42:05,106 --> 00:42:08,318
Each damaged compartment
degrades the entire hull.

638
00:42:08,485 --> 00:42:10,779
<i>[Josh] The objective is simple.</i>

639
00:42:10,946 --> 00:42:12,864
<i>The obstacles are gigantic.</i>

640
00:42:13,031 --> 00:42:15,283
<i>We're going to need
all the help in the world,</i>

641
00:42:15,450 --> 00:42:17,953
<i>but if we are to avoid
panic and chaos,</i>

642
00:42:18,119 --> 00:42:20,872
<i>the world at large can never
know what's happening here.</i>

643
00:42:21,039 --> 00:42:23,083
<i>Which is where our friend
Mr. Rat comes in.</i>

644
00:42:23,250 --> 00:42:26,503
[Rat] It's called Virus-bot. It's a
computer virus that will seek out files

645
00:42:26,670 --> 00:42:29,464
anywhere on the Web that contain
keywords that we designate

646
00:42:29,631 --> 00:42:34,386
and wipes them out.
This is my kung fu, and it is strong.

647
00:42:34,553 --> 00:42:38,181
<i>[Josh] Meanwhile, there are
a million puzzles ahead of us,</i>

648
00:42:38,348 --> 00:42:39,432
<i>and we have three months
to solve them.</i>

649
00:42:39,599 --> 00:42:41,685
<i>We have a committed
and ingenious team.</i>

650
00:42:41,851 --> 00:42:45,230
<i>We have every resource
available to us, and we have the best</i>

651
00:42:45,397 --> 00:42:47,691
<i>of the world's scientific
and technical talents on our side.</i>

652
00:42:47,857 --> 00:42:52,112
<i>With your help we can,
we must... succeed.</i>

653
00:42:52,696 --> 00:42:55,156
[indistinct conversations]

654
00:42:56,825 --> 00:42:58,910
- Feedback in the resonance tube.
- Talk to me, gentlemen.

655
00:42:59,077 --> 00:43:00,870
[Serge] We are losing
structural integrity.

656
00:43:01,037 --> 00:43:03,748
No, it's not feedback.
It's an impeller malfunction, I believe.

657
00:43:03,915 --> 00:43:05,417
No, it's not, no. If it were
an impeller malfunction...

658
00:43:05,584 --> 00:43:07,627
For God's sakes, Braz, make the call!

659
00:43:07,794 --> 00:43:09,546
No, I'll make the call.
I should make the call.

660
00:43:09,713 --> 00:43:11,464
[Beck] Sixty-five knots!

661
00:43:11,631 --> 00:43:13,383
Depth, 8-5 thousand feet.

662
00:43:13,550 --> 00:43:14,676
L0ok,guys...

663
00:43:18,513 --> 00:43:19,556
It's a disaster!

664
00:43:19,723 --> 00:43:20,724
[laughing]

665
00:43:21,433 --> 00:43:23,560
[alarm blaring]

666
00:43:24,811 --> 00:43:27,689
What part of "talk to me"
don't you guys understand?

667
00:43:27,856 --> 00:43:31,318
For the 22nd time in a row,
everyone on Earth is dead.

668
00:43:32,527 --> 00:43:34,237
Let's take a little quiet time,

669
00:43:34,404 --> 00:43:36,364
and you all are going
to try this again.

670
00:43:41,077 --> 00:43:44,789
- Hey
- Hi.

671
00:43:46,791 --> 00:43:48,084
What is this?

672
00:43:48,251 --> 00:43:51,880
Uh, well, it's... I invented it.

673
00:43:52,047 --> 00:43:55,008
It's how you're going to...
going to steer underground.

674
00:43:55,175 --> 00:43:58,386
It's... not very good reception.

675
00:43:58,553 --> 00:44:00,180
[Josh] Well, uh, you're looking

676
00:44:00,347 --> 00:44:03,391
through three feet of lead
at 50 yards away, so...

677
00:44:03,558 --> 00:44:04,809
...it ain't bad.

678
00:44:06,186 --> 00:44:10,899
It's like a CAT scan at a hospital,
but it's, uh, it's souped-up.

679
00:44:11,941 --> 00:44:13,485
I invented it
for deep earth surveying.

680
00:44:13,652 --> 00:44:15,904
And then the government came in,
bought my research,

681
00:44:16,071 --> 00:44:18,573
paid off my student loan guys
and made me a consultant.

682
00:44:18,740 --> 00:44:22,702
I'm sorry, this is really delicate.
And I have it just the way I want it.

683
00:44:22,869 --> 00:44:26,790
So... excuse me.

684
00:44:26,956 --> 00:44:29,417
Uh... Yeah. Then they brought me in
when the pacemakers quit,

685
00:44:29,584 --> 00:44:32,587
and... boom, you know,
I'm Apocalypse Boy.

686
00:44:33,296 --> 00:44:35,090
Apocalypse Boy?

687
00:44:35,256 --> 00:44:38,677
Yeah. I'm having T-shirts made up.

688
00:44:38,843 --> 00:44:40,929
Well, hats sell better.

689
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:46,101
You know, it's funny, because
that is right where it should be.

690
00:44:46,267 --> 00:44:47,310
Well...

691
00:44:47,477 --> 00:44:48,853
I'm sorry. I'm a little
ragged around the edges.

692
00:44:49,020 --> 00:44:50,522
I'm just trying to get
this thing to focus correctly.

693
00:44:50,689 --> 00:44:54,234
- This is cool, but can I just...?
- Well... Mm-hm.

694
00:45:04,494 --> 00:45:08,123
It's better. It's better. Ah...

695

[electrical zapping]

696
00:45:35,150 --> 00:45:37,652
God, I hate this sky.

699
00:46:20,111 --> 00:46:22,906
[Bob] Crashing one ship
isn't enough for you?

700
00:46:23,072 --> 00:46:24,699
Hey. Practice makes perfect.

701
00:46:26,576 --> 00:46:27,535
You can practise all you like.

702
00:46:27,702 --> 00:46:28,953
It doesn't mean you're ready
to sit on that seat.

703
00:46:29,120 --> 00:46:31,873
So you keep reminding me, sir.

704
00:46:33,082 --> 00:46:34,793
You know, I doubt
you're even going to listen to this,

705
00:46:34,959 --> 00:46:36,044
but I'm going to give it a shot.

706
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:43,092
Being a leader isn't about ability.
It's about responsibility.

707
00:46:44,219 --> 00:46:45,887
- Got it, sir.
- No, you don't, Beck.

708
00:46:46,054 --> 00:46:48,681
I mean, you're not just responsible
for making good decisions.

709
00:46:48,848 --> 00:46:51,226
You have to be responsible
for the bad ones.

710
00:46:52,268 --> 00:46:55,021
You got to be ready
to make the shitty call.

711
00:46:55,188 --> 00:46:57,398
- What makes you think I'm not?
- Because you're so good.

712
00:46:58,608 --> 00:47:01,569
You haven't hit anything
you couldn't beat.

713
00:47:01,736 --> 00:47:03,988
I mean, hell, you were the one who
figured out how to save the shuttle.

714
00:47:04,155 --> 00:47:06,616
You made me, you made the rest
of NASA just look like an ass.

715
00:47:08,493 --> 00:47:11,412
It's just that
you're used to winning...

716
00:47:15,166 --> 00:47:17,836
...and you're not really
a leader until you've lost.

719
00:47:26,970 --> 00:47:29,639
- I wouldn't call them chefs.

721
00:47:31,099 --> 00:47:33,601
It's about nutrition.

00:47:55,123 --> 00:47:56,374
[Josh] It's a lightning superstorm.

- Popping up all over the world.
- Got 'em. Tracking.

728
00:48:02,922 --> 00:48:05,967
Uh-oh. Rome does not look good.

This planet is decaying faster
than we thought.

It's just the start.

742
00:50:01,749 --> 00:50:04,419
Soon they'll be EM spikes and microwaves
will break through the weak spots and...

743
00:50:04,627 --> 00:50:08,297
All right. Get this ship
in the ground. Now.

- ...this is the time for...
- [laughs]

751
00:51:12,570 --> 00:51:14,947
- Josh, do you mind?
- No, not at all. Yeah.

752
00:51:16,157 --> 00:51:17,617
We should have a name
for this baby.

- Oh, she's called Virgil, actually.
- Virgil,

754
00:51:19,827 --> 00:51:21,788
the poet that led our man
into the depths of hell?

755
00:51:21,954 --> 00:51:23,206
- That's it.
- That's appropriate, I guess.

756
00:51:23,372 --> 00:51:25,083
Well, here's to <i>Virgil.</i>

757
00:51:26,459 --> 00:51:28,336

Still think the water-launch
was a good idea?

Yes, yes, I chose this location
because the crust is thin here.

805
00:56:19,710 --> 00:56:22,338
The downside is... there's lots
of seismic activity.

Four thousand feet.

No, there's not enough time
for power-up.

00:59:25,354 --> 00:59:26,897
- reconfiguring every five minutes.
- [exhales]

838
00:59:27,064 --> 00:59:30,568
Hull integrity 100 per cent.
Reactor power 100 per cent.

839
00:59:30,734 --> 00:59:33,654
- All green on the bomb compartment.
- Speed is 60 knots.

840
00:59:33,821 --> 00:59:35,781
[laughs] Hot damn.

841
00:59:35,948 --> 00:59:39,243
All right, we'll be through the crust
in 15 minutes and into the mantle.

842
00:59:39,410 --> 00:59:41,787
Twenty-four hours to the core,
and then assuming we survive...

843
00:59:41,954 --> 00:59:44,123
- Assuming?
- Yes, assuming.

844
00:59:44,290 --> 00:59:47,418
Another 15 hours to the
inner core-outer core border.

845
00:59:47,585 --> 00:59:48,419
[beeping]

846
00:59:48,586 --> 00:59:52,047
- They're doing well.
- The crust is just rock.

847
00:59:52,548 --> 00:59:54,049
Now, it gets interesting.

848
00:59:54,216 --> 00:59:55,593
<i>Virgil, can we get a status check?</i>

849
00:59:55,759 --> 00:59:57,970
We're about to make
the transition into the mantle.

850
01:00:27,541 --> 01:00:29,501
- [rumbling]
- Come on, come on.

851
01:00:43,182 --> 01:00:44,516
[exhales]

852
01:00:44,683 --> 01:00:48,646
Well, exterior pressure
is 800,000 pounds per square inch.

853
01:00:48,812 --> 01:00:51,482
And hull integrity is 100 per cent.

854
01:00:51,649 --> 01:00:55,486
It's as if we we're diving
through the memories of the planet.

855
01:00:55,653 --> 01:00:59,990
But we are about to pass
from memory into madness.

856
01:01:00,699 --> 01:01:02,201
Are you going to be doing

857
01:01:02,368 --> 01:01:04,745
that Carl Sagan narration
all the way to the core?

858
01:01:04,912 --> 01:01:07,289
- I beg your pardon?
- I said...

859
01:01:07,456 --> 01:01:09,583
[stammers] I have an obligation
to my students...

860
01:01:09,750 --> 01:01:11,210
An obligation to make
a book deal perhaps?

861
01:01:11,377 --> 01:01:12,836
[Zimsky] Two book deals,
if you'd like to know the truth.

862
01:01:13,003 --> 01:01:15,547
I read that last book.
It wasn't very good.

863
01:01:15,714 --> 01:01:17,508
[Zimsky] Oh, really? Really?
When did you learn how to read?

864
01:01:17,675 --> 01:01:18,509
[Braz] You amaze me.

865
01:01:38,237 --> 01:01:39,446
[Bob] People.

866
01:01:40,447 --> 01:01:42,950
Drs. Zimsky and Keyes?

867
01:01:45,911 --> 01:01:47,871
You guys are
our resident geophysicists.

868
01:01:48,038 --> 01:01:49,373
What do you make of this?

869
01:01:49,540 --> 01:01:54,002
The mantle is a chemical hodgepodge
of... a variety of elements...

870
01:01:54,169 --> 01:01:57,881
Say it with me: "I don't know."

871
01:01:58,048 --> 01:02:02,219
Well, Commander, wise men say,
"When in doubt, you should go around."

872
01:02:02,386 --> 01:02:05,055
No. It's too big. We turn too slow.

873
01:02:05,222 --> 01:02:07,725
Anything that we can't go through
displays as black.

874
01:02:07,891 --> 01:02:11,812
- So, what's... what's static?
- It's nothing.

875
01:02:11,979 --> 01:02:16,316
- What do you mean?
- It's nothing.

876
01:02:18,318 --> 01:02:19,319
It's empty space.

877
01:02:20,320 --> 01:02:21,989
L.-

878
01:02:23,532 --> 01:02:25,367
I never taught the computer how
to read empty space.

879
01:02:25,534 --> 01:02:26,785
And I never taught <i>Virgil</i>
how to fly.

880
01:02:28,120 --> 01:02:29,413
Oh, God!

881
01:02:45,429 --> 01:02:47,347
[all grunting]

882
01:02:51,685 --> 01:02:53,479
Oh, no, man!

883
01:03:06,533 --> 01:03:08,285
[Bob] Oh, dear God.

884
01:03:16,919 --> 01:03:17,836
[grunts]

885
01:03:26,220 --> 01:03:27,137
[shouts]

886
01:03:34,728 --> 01:03:36,188
[groaning]

887
01:03:41,985 --> 01:03:42,861
Ah!

888
01:03:43,612 --> 01:03:44,530
[screams]

889
01:03:55,582 --> 01:03:58,460
[all grunting, panting]

890
01:03:59,962 --> 01:04:01,296
Serge, you all right?

891
01:04:02,965 --> 01:04:04,466
Yeah.

892
01:04:11,473 --> 01:04:14,518
- Anybody hurt?
- No. You OK?

893
01:04:14,685 --> 01:04:15,686
- Yeah.
- [craft hissing]

894
01:04:15,853 --> 01:04:17,145
What's that? What is that?

895
01:04:17,312 --> 01:04:20,691
From the cooling system.
Shut that down. Shut it down.

896
01:04:20,858 --> 01:04:23,777
I told you to go around her.
Nobody listens to me.

897
01:04:23,944 --> 01:04:25,112
Where in God's name are we?

898
01:04:25,279 --> 01:04:28,574
Whatever has us jammed up
is inside our lasers. Shut 'em down.

899
01:04:32,035 --> 01:04:33,829
We're not going anywhere.

900
01:04:38,250 --> 01:04:39,793
Powering down.

901
01:04:39,960 --> 01:04:42,212
[ship powers down]

902
01:04:45,340 --> 01:04:48,135
Josh, is there any other image
you can pull up?

903
01:04:48,302 --> 01:04:52,973
Nope. Whatever it is,
it's also inside our MRI cameras.

904
01:04:54,391 --> 01:04:56,685
- We have to go outside.
- [Serge] What?

905
01:04:56,852 --> 01:05:00,063
Believe me, I hate to admit it,
but I think he's right.

906
01:05:00,230 --> 01:05:02,149
- I'm coming. I want to collect samples.
- [Bob] Wait, hang on, hang on.

907
01:05:02,316 --> 01:05:04,276
The first problem is,
the only way out of the ship

908
01:05:04,443 --> 01:05:07,446
is the way we came in,
which is through the impeller outlet...

909
01:05:07,613 --> 01:05:10,157
- Which is still at 5,000 degrees.
- Exactly, I mean...

910
01:05:10,324 --> 01:05:13,827
I'll just flush it with liquid nitrogen
from the cooling system.

911
01:05:13,994 --> 01:05:17,831
Wait. The cooling system that's keeping
us from roasting to death in this ship?

912
01:05:17,998 --> 01:05:21,460
Well, just a small part of it.

913
01:05:24,421 --> 01:05:28,258
Alternatives? Anybody.

914
01:05:40,604 --> 01:05:42,606
[heavy breathing]

915
01:05:43,857 --> 01:05:45,192
[Bob] Whoa, whoa, that's it.

916
01:05:45,359 --> 01:05:48,862
[Josh] It's like a giant...
giant crystal.

917
01:05:49,029 --> 01:05:51,865
- [Zimsky] Where the hell are we?
- [Bob] Well, the good news is,

918
01:05:52,032 --> 01:05:53,951
it looks like the suits
can take the pressure.

919
01:05:55,953 --> 01:05:57,871
It's completely jammed
the laser assembly.

920
01:05:58,038 --> 01:06:00,374
We just... we got to hope,
if we can cut it loose,

921
01:06:00,540 --> 01:06:01,667
- they're still functional.
- Careful!

922
01:06:02,334 --> 01:06:03,752
OK.

923
01:06:04,711 --> 01:06:05,712
Got it.

924
01:06:05,879 --> 01:06:09,424
- Beck, try the lights, will you?
- Lighting up.

925
01:06:13,845 --> 01:06:17,099
- Oh, it's magnificent.
- [Zimsky] Oh, my God.

926
01:06:18,058 --> 01:06:20,268
[Braz] Aladdin's cave.

927
01:06:20,435 --> 01:06:23,730
[Zimsky] It's like
a crystal Grand Canyon.

928
01:06:38,912 --> 01:06:40,080
I think it's a geode.

929
01:06:40,247 --> 01:06:44,167
But I don't understand
how it could have survived down here.

930
01:06:44,334 --> 01:06:47,170
- Cobalt shell, maybe?
- [Zimsky] Well, I mean,

931
01:06:47,337 --> 01:06:49,756
in a magma environment
of 5,000 degrees.

932
01:06:49,923 --> 01:06:52,634
Something would have to protect it.
Unbelievable.

933
01:06:53,427 --> 01:06:54,886
- Zimsky.
- Yeah?

934
01:06:55,887 --> 01:06:58,265
We're inside a giant gem bubble,

935
01:06:58,432 --> 01:07:00,976
wrapped in a cobalt cocoon

936
01:07:01,643 --> 01:07:04,021
700 miles below the surface
of the Earth.

937
01:07:06,690 --> 01:07:09,401
- Hell of a day.
- [Zimsky laughing]

938
01:07:09,568 --> 01:07:11,403
Yes, it is.

939
01:07:11,570 --> 01:07:12,946
- [Braz] I'll start cutting.
- [Bob] OK, Braz.

940
01:07:13,113 --> 01:07:15,198
I'm going to check the hull.
Call me if you need me.

941
01:07:15,365 --> 01:07:16,867
- OK.
- [tool powering up]

942
01:07:18,535 --> 01:07:20,620
[Zapping]

943
01:07:21,038 --> 01:07:22,247
[hissing]

944
01:07:24,291 --> 01:07:25,751
Oh, no.

945
01:07:26,835 --> 01:07:27,961
- Zimsky!
- Yeah?

946
01:07:28,128 --> 01:07:30,589
- Zimsky...
- Look! It's an amethyst.

947
01:07:31,923 --> 01:07:34,301
[Zimsky] Oh, God,
we've breached the shell.

948
01:07:41,683 --> 01:07:42,809
[shouts]

949
01:07:42,976 --> 01:07:45,479
- [gasps]
- [all shouting]

950
01:07:50,525 --> 01:07:53,528
Guys, you don't have to be here!
I want you back inside!

951
01:07:53,695 --> 01:07:57,074
Well, I think that means me.
Orders are orders.

952
01:08:05,248 --> 01:08:07,042
Wait, Josh.

953
01:08:07,918 --> 01:08:09,503
The problem is I'm losing oxygen.

954
01:08:09,669 --> 01:08:12,172
- Braz, what can I do?
- Check the feeds for me.

955
01:08:13,215 --> 01:08:15,675
Check the feeds for me, Josh.

956
01:08:19,387 --> 01:08:20,305
Quick!

957
01:08:20,472 --> 01:08:21,640
I'm coming. I'm coming
as fast as I can.

958
01:08:22,349 --> 01:08:25,227
Hey, guys, at this rate we have three
minutes before the lava gets to us.

959
01:08:25,393 --> 01:08:27,187
Come on, guys. Come on.

960
01:08:31,983 --> 01:08:32,943
[beeps]

961
01:08:33,110 --> 01:08:34,736
[Braz] It's not going to work
without oxygen!

962
01:08:34,903 --> 01:08:36,863
We're losing oxygen!

963
01:08:37,030 --> 01:08:38,907
[air hissing]

964
01:08:46,039 --> 01:08:47,082
I fixed it. Now cut!

965
01:08:47,249 --> 01:08:50,127
[Braz] That's good. It's working now.
It's working well now!

966
01:08:50,293 --> 01:08:52,003
That's good, Josh!

967
01:09:03,098 --> 01:09:06,226
- Josh's vital signs are dropping.
- What?

968
01:09:09,354 --> 01:09:10,647
[exhales]

969
01:09:11,731 --> 01:09:13,567
Serge!

970
01:09:16,194 --> 01:09:20,824
[Braz] You're almost there.
You're almost there, Josh.

971
01:09:32,127 --> 01:09:34,588
- [grunts]
- Josh!

972
01:09:36,381 --> 01:09:38,884
[grunting]

973
01:09:48,351 --> 01:09:49,519
[grunts]

974
01:09:51,313 --> 01:09:54,774
- Joshua!
- OK, guys, connect the oxygen.

975
01:09:54,941 --> 01:09:56,985
- [Bob] Braz, you got that?
- [Braz] Yes. Connected!

976
01:09:57,152 --> 01:09:59,154
<i>[Bob] Good. I got to check these lasers.</i>

977
01:10:00,197 --> 01:10:02,908
OK, Beck, turn 'em over.

978
01:10:03,825 --> 01:10:05,493
Pre-lasers only,
if you don't mind.

979
01:10:05,660 --> 01:10:06,786
Initiating.

980
01:10:09,122 --> 01:10:12,083
This better work.
The tide's really coming in.

981
01:10:13,668 --> 01:10:14,920
Yes!

982
01:10:16,504 --> 01:10:18,548
We got lucky! I think we're going
to swim right out of this one.

983
01:10:20,800 --> 01:10:22,844
Bob?

984
01:10:23,470 --> 01:10:24,763
[gasps]

985
01:10:34,356 --> 01:10:35,774
[long beep]

01:10:38,610 --> 01:10:40,278
Bob?

987
01:10:45,992 --> 01:10:47,494
Bob...

988
01:10:50,997 --> 01:10:52,916
Braz, come on, it's over.

989
01:10:53,458 --> 01:10:55,502
OK. OK.

990
01:10:55,669 --> 01:10:57,337
Beck! Beck!

991
01:10:57,963 --> 01:10:59,631
<i>We're coming in.</i>

992
01:10:59,798 --> 01:11:02,509
<i>[panting] Initiate start sequence.</i>

993
01:11:03,176 --> 01:11:04,135
Beck!

994
01:11:04,302 --> 01:11:06,554
- Beck, do you hear me?
- [Serge] Careful.

995
01:11:07,555 --> 01:11:08,974
<i>Start the impellers!</i>

996
01:11:11,434 --> 01:11:13,979
The door, open the door.

997
01:11:14,604 --> 01:11:16,690
<i>Activate bulkhead doors!</i>

998
01:11:17,357 --> 01:11:19,234
<i>Now, Beck!</i>

999
01:11:54,144 --> 01:11:55,478
[gasps]

1000
01:11:59,858 --> 01:12:02,193
You OK? You're going to be weak.
You're OK.

1001
01:12:02,360 --> 01:12:03,695
Good job, good job. Good man.

1002
01:12:03,862 --> 01:12:05,905
- Well done, well done.
- [Josh] I'm fine. Thank you.

1003
01:12:07,032 --> 01:12:11,244
So... we have some good news, and...

1004
01:12:11,411 --> 01:12:12,620
...and we have some bad news.

1005
01:12:12,787 --> 01:12:14,331
Good news.
I'll take good news.

1006
01:12:14,497 --> 01:12:18,376
- All right.
- Well, we're alive and we're moving.

1007
01:12:18,960 --> 01:12:20,712
That's g... that's good news.

1008
01:12:21,963 --> 01:12:23,381
Oh, it is hot in here.

1009
01:12:23,548 --> 01:12:26,760
Yeah, that nitro we flushed out of the
cooling system, it's causing things

1010
01:12:26,926 --> 01:12:29,804
just to heat up a little. I'm going
to go back and make some adjustments.

1011
01:12:29,971 --> 01:12:32,891
- I'll lend you a hand.
- I'm fine.

1012
01:12:33,058 --> 01:12:35,268
[Beck] I'm going to check
your heartbeat, OK?

1013
01:12:35,435 --> 01:12:37,729
Thanks, Braz. Appreciate it.

1014
01:12:39,356 --> 01:12:42,067
So, that's the bad news?
That's not too bad.

1015
01:12:42,233 --> 01:12:45,779
No. Commander Iverson died.

1016
01:12:45,945 --> 01:12:51,576
But... we're living,
and he would want to...

1017
01:12:51,743 --> 01:12:53,036
He'd want us to
complete our mission,

1018
01:12:53,203 --> 01:12:56,498
so I think that it's
important that we all...

1019
01:12:59,417 --> 01:13:04,214
- It's all right.
- Thank you.

1020
01:13:04,381 --> 01:13:06,633
I'm sorry.

1021
01:13:09,135 --> 01:13:13,848
Let's give him a second, OK?
He deserves that.

1022
01:13:19,437 --> 01:13:22,649
Oh, God, this all just seems
too big, doesn't it?

1023
01:13:25,151 --> 01:13:26,528
I think you were attempting
the impossible.

1024
01:13:26,694 --> 01:13:29,489
You were trying
to save the world, and...

1025
01:13:30,281 --> 01:13:32,117
...it's overwhelming.

1026
01:13:33,076 --> 01:13:35,161
I came here to save my wife
and my two children

1027
01:13:35,328 --> 01:13:39,999
and... six billion lives...
it's too much.

1028
01:13:40,166 --> 01:13:44,254
I just hope I'm smart enough
and brave enough to save three.

1029
01:13:46,131 --> 01:13:48,925
You did a nice job, Joshua.
Very nice. Great.

1030
01:13:49,092 --> 01:13:51,886
- You'd have done the same thing.
- Well, maybe, maybe.

1031
01:14:02,689 --> 01:14:05,942
Hey... who's steering the ship?

1032
01:14:06,109 --> 01:14:10,196
- Video screen autopilot.
- I hope he knows the way.

1033
01:14:10,363 --> 01:14:12,240
You and me both.

1034
01:14:14,492 --> 01:14:19,330
So... you're really
a college professor?

1035
01:14:19,497 --> 01:14:24,335
You're not from the CIA or the NSA
or any of those three-letter places?

1036
01:14:24,502 --> 01:14:27,714
No. I am a boring college professor.

1037
01:14:27,881 --> 01:14:30,884
Wrong place, wrong place.

1038
01:14:33,094 --> 01:14:35,472
That was the bravest thing
I've ever seen.

1039
01:14:37,098 --> 01:14:39,851
Well, I just, I just...
Listen, the lack of oxygen

1040
01:14:40,018 --> 01:14:41,978
kept me from weeping
like a little girl,

1041
01:14:42,145 --> 01:14:45,315
as is my custom
in dangerous situations.

1042
01:14:53,239 --> 01:14:57,327
[Beck] Hey, guys, we're close
to the mantle core interface.

1043
01:14:57,494 --> 01:14:58,453
Where are you?

1044
01:14:58,620 --> 01:15:01,247
[Serge] Key's in, Dr. Brazzelton.

1045
01:15:01,414 --> 01:15:04,542
- Ready.
- [Josh] We are in the

1046
01:15:04,709 --> 01:15:06,169
- luxurious, beautiful...
- [Serge] OK, the code...

1047
01:15:06,336 --> 01:15:10,131
...weapons control
checking the controls on the nukes.

1048
01:15:10,298 --> 01:15:11,758
[Serge] This is
the birthday of my daughter.

1049
01:15:11,925 --> 01:15:14,177
[Braz] O-3-1-9-9-5.

1050
01:15:14,344 --> 01:15:18,598
- Ready? Three, two and one.
- Yeah.

1051
01:15:19,891 --> 01:15:21,309
Thank you.

1052
01:15:21,476 --> 01:15:22,477
Green. All green.

1053
01:15:23,061 --> 01:15:26,105
Great. So we have
to synchronise the babies now.

1054
01:15:30,443 --> 01:15:32,487
Just a second.

1055
01:15:33,321 --> 01:15:34,364
- There.
- Mm-hm.

1056
01:15:34,531 --> 01:15:36,658
All right, now let's
put them to bed.

1057
01:15:39,077 --> 01:15:40,995
Zimsky, could you please come up
here for a second?

1058
01:15:41,704 --> 01:15:43,331
- Yes?
- We're not supposed

1059
01:15:43,498 --> 01:15:46,376
- to go through anything black.
- Yes, so please don't.

1060
01:15:46,543 --> 01:15:47,961
What is this?

1061
01:15:49,921 --> 01:15:51,381
[Zimsky] They're scattered everywhere.

1062
01:15:54,092 --> 01:15:56,553
Oh, my God! They're diamonds!

1063
01:15:57,554 --> 01:15:59,013
[Beck] Great.

1064
01:15:59,180 --> 01:16:03,142
You might want to sit down and buckle
up. We're on a collision course here.

1065
01:16:10,275 --> 01:16:11,651
Alrighty. Careful.

1066
01:16:15,405 --> 01:16:19,742
Guys, we're dodging diamonds
the size of Cape Cod, so bear with me.

1067
01:16:19,909 --> 01:16:21,619
Not exactly nimble here.

1068
01:16:21,786 --> 01:16:24,330
- Diamonds? I want some.
- Can I help?

1069
01:16:47,228 --> 01:16:48,438
Oh!

1070
01:16:49,814 --> 01:16:52,984
- [thudding]
- OK. It's OK.

1071
01:16:55,528 --> 01:16:57,989
[Beck] OK, it looks like
we're in the clear.

1072
01:17:03,161 --> 01:17:04,662
- [scraping]
- [alarm beeping]

1073
01:17:04,829 --> 01:17:05,788
Breach!

1074
01:17:05,955 --> 01:17:09,792
Guys! Weapons control, get out!
Get out now!

1075
01:17:20,094 --> 01:17:21,429
[Josh] Serge!

1076
01:17:24,140 --> 01:17:28,227
Serge! What the hell are you doing?
Come on!

1077
01:17:28,394 --> 01:17:31,064
[$6rge] My notebook!

1078
01:17:34,442 --> 01:17:35,860
Serge!

1079
01:17:42,116 --> 01:17:44,285
Take the time reg, Joshua!

1080
01:17:44,452 --> 01:17:48,206
- Come on Serge! Come on!
- My notes! You'll need them!

1081
01:17:48,373 --> 01:17:51,125
No! God, no, Serge!

1082
01:17:51,292 --> 01:17:54,337
- It's OK.
- Serge, come on! No!

1083
01:17:54,504 --> 01:17:56,631
Serge!

1084
01:17:56,798 --> 01:17:58,883
We need the box!

1085
01:17:59,050 --> 01:18:00,551
[Braz shouting]

1086
01:18:00,718 --> 01:18:02,345
We can get him!
We can get him!

1087
01:18:02,512 --> 01:18:04,847
Hold on, Serge!

1088
01:18:19,404 --> 01:18:22,949
Beck! Beck!
Override the ejection system!

1089
01:18:24,367 --> 01:18:27,328
Beck, no! One damaged compartment
threatens the whole ship!

1090
01:18:28,204 --> 01:18:30,498
Beck! Beck!

1091
01:18:31,290 --> 01:18:34,627
<i>Override the ejection system!</i>

1092
01:18:40,091 --> 01:18:43,052
Serge, we're right here. We're not
going to forget about you, man.

1093
01:18:43,219 --> 01:18:44,762
- Josh, can you hear me?
- Serge! Serge...

1094
01:18:44,929 --> 01:18:47,056
Hey, buddy, look in your monitor
right now. Serge, look in your monitor.

1095
01:18:47,223 --> 01:18:51,394
<i>- I'm right here. Serge...
- Josh, I can't see you.</i>

1096
01:18:51,561 --> 01:18:53,855
Braz is going to override
the doors manually, OK?

1097
01:18:54,021 --> 01:18:56,482
We're working on it right now.
Braz, how long?

1098
01:18:56,649 --> 01:18:59,569
Going as fast as I can,
fast as I can.

1099
01:18:59,736 --> 01:19:01,738
- OK, I'm scared.
- We're going right now.

1100
01:19:01,904 --> 01:19:04,365
- Shouldn't be two seconds, all right?
- <i>Josh!</i>

1101
01:19:04,532 --> 01:19:07,034
Beck, override
the ejection systems, OK?

1102
01:19:07,201 --> 01:19:09,662
<i>Damn it. I don't think
Beck can hear me.</i>

1103
01:19:09,829 --> 01:19:11,748
<i>Serge, look at me now. Serge!</i>

1104
01:19:11,914 --> 01:19:14,459
Serge, we're right here, OK? We're not
going to forget about you, man.

1105
01:19:14,625 --> 01:19:18,045
I'm going to get you out of here.
We're working on it, all right?

1106
01:19:18,212 --> 01:19:22,633
- Stay with me here. OK?
- [sobs] I don't know what to do.

1107
01:19:22,800 --> 01:19:24,635
You can hear me now?
All right, here I am.

1108
01:19:24,802 --> 01:19:28,806
I'm not going to let you go, man. I'm
not going to let you go, all right?

1109
01:19:28,973 --> 01:19:31,100
<i>Stay with me here, OK?</i>

1110
01:19:31,267 --> 01:19:35,521
I'm going to come to Paris
and we'll go out, all right? After this.

1111
01:19:35,688 --> 01:19:37,231
After this is all
said and done, all right?

1112
01:19:37,398 --> 01:19:39,025
- <i>Josh!</i>
- Serge!

1113
01:19:39,192 --> 01:19:44,030
- Serge! Serge! Serge!
- [Serge screaming]

1114
01:19:45,239 --> 01:19:46,199
<i>Serge _/</i>

1115
01:20:06,177 --> 01:20:07,595
[sighs]

1116
01:20:09,764 --> 01:20:12,225
- [inhales sharply]
- [kicking console]

1117
01:20:39,335 --> 01:20:41,087
Did you reset the overrides?

1118
01:20:44,215 --> 01:20:46,050
I never pushed them.

1119
01:20:46,926 --> 01:20:48,761
You let him die.

1120
01:20:51,430 --> 01:20:54,183
Actually, you really want to know?
I killed him twice.

1121
01:20:54,350 --> 01:20:56,894
First when I hit the diamond, and then
when I didn't hit the override.

1122
01:20:57,061 --> 01:20:59,272
Do you want me to feel any worse
about that than I already do?

1123
01:20:59,438 --> 01:21:00,439
It's not possible.

1124
01:21:00,606 --> 01:21:01,899
Why are you being so smug about that?

1125
01:21:02,066 --> 01:21:03,901
- Could you have made the decision?
- [Josh] Yes.

1126
01:21:04,068 --> 01:21:05,236
- Could you?
- Yes, I could've.

1127
01:21:05,403 --> 01:21:07,613
If you would've hit that switch,
I could've got him outta there!

1128
01:21:07,780 --> 01:21:09,490
I was yelling for you!

1129
01:21:13,661 --> 01:21:15,288
Take it and look at it!

1130
01:21:16,706 --> 01:21:18,666
I was two inches from him!

1131
01:21:18,833 --> 01:21:22,253
I was two inches, and I told you
to put the door up and you didn't!

1132
01:21:22,795 --> 01:21:26,257
I was screaming for you!
Why didn't you do it?!

1133
01:21:27,633 --> 01:21:31,012
Because I had to make that decision.
Fate or God...

1134
01:21:31,178 --> 01:21:33,973
No! Damn it!
You leave God out of this!

1135
01:21:34,140 --> 01:21:36,309
Serge died so that we could
complete our job.

1136
01:21:36,475 --> 01:21:37,935
Oh, that's right,
the job of saving the world.

1137
01:21:38,102 --> 01:21:42,481
Not the whole world, Josh!
Just three of them.

1138
01:22:30,237 --> 01:22:33,157
- [monitor beeping]
- [quiet chattering]

1139
01:22:33,366 --> 01:22:37,078
Virgil, you are approaching
core interface. Are you good to go?

1140
01:22:37,244 --> 01:22:39,038
[Braz] Josh?

1141
01:22:39,205 --> 01:22:40,831
Josh, can you hear me?

1142
01:22:43,167 --> 01:22:45,461
Josh, can you hear me?

1143
01:22:49,966 --> 01:22:52,468
Ready as we'll ever be, Stick.

1144
01:22:52,635 --> 01:22:54,387
Dr. Keyes.

1145
01:22:56,055 --> 01:22:57,348
Right here.

1146
01:23:00,810 --> 01:23:03,396
Deep Earth, we are green
and good to go.

1147
01:23:43,686 --> 01:23:46,689
We just got a huge speed jump.
We're at 95 knots...

1148
01:23:46,856 --> 01:23:47,815
...110...

1149
01:23:47,982 --> 01:23:50,484
...13O... 140.

1150
01:23:52,111 --> 01:23:53,946
Our speed's jumped
because the density of the core

1151
01:23:54,113 --> 01:23:56,532
is different than our estimates.
It's lighter than we thought.

1152
01:23:56,699 --> 01:23:58,617
- So much for best guesses.
- [Beck] I'm fine with this.

1153
01:23:58,784 --> 01:24:01,037
At this rate, we'll,
what, hit the inner core

1154
01:24:01,203 --> 01:24:04,498
in a little over five hours.
I think we finally bought some luck.

1155
01:24:04,665 --> 01:24:06,042
- Braz.
- Yeah.

1156
01:24:06,208 --> 01:24:07,918
Would you please punch
the new core density into the equations

1157
01:24:08,085 --> 01:24:10,129
for the nuclear detonation?

1158
01:24:15,092 --> 01:24:17,011
Please tell me this is enough.

1159
01:24:22,683 --> 01:24:24,769
- Failure.
- [Beck] You're telling me

1160
01:24:24,935 --> 01:24:26,687
the 1,000 megatons
of nuclear warheads

1161
01:24:26,854 --> 01:24:28,647
we hauled down here
isn't going to cut it?

1162
01:24:29,815 --> 01:24:32,151
No. This core material is too thin.

1163
01:24:32,318 --> 01:24:33,652
- What?
- [Zimsky] The energy waves from

1164
01:24:33,819 --> 01:24:34,904
the explosion
won't spread far enough.

1165
01:24:35,071 --> 01:24:36,405
They'll just bleed
away into nothing.

1166
01:24:40,076 --> 01:24:41,535
[exhales, stammers]

1167
01:24:42,203 --> 01:24:43,204
That's it.

1168
01:24:43,370 --> 01:24:47,500
- We go home. We go home.
- [Josh] Home?

1169
01:24:47,666 --> 01:24:51,003
Our commander is dead.
Our weapons specialist is dead.

1170
01:24:51,170 --> 01:24:52,880
Our weapons control systems are gone.

1171
01:24:53,047 --> 01:24:55,591
We don't know whether
we can arm the nuclear devices,

1172
01:24:55,758 --> 01:24:59,220
and our plan to fix the core
no longer works. So... we have failed.

1173
01:24:59,386 --> 01:25:00,429
We have not failed.

1174
01:25:00,596 --> 01:25:05,184
We have failed, and we go home,
and we go to the alternative.

1175
01:25:05,351 --> 01:25:06,685
What alternative?
What are you talking about?

1176
01:25:06,852 --> 01:25:09,522
General, this is Dr. Conrad Zimsky.

1177
01:25:09,688 --> 01:25:10,606
Destiny is a go.

1178
01:25:10,773 --> 01:25:13,275
<i>Repeat. Destiny is a go.</i>

1179
01:25:13,442 --> 01:25:14,860
[sighs] Damn.

1180
01:25:19,365 --> 01:25:22,493
I need to know
everything to do my job.

1181
01:25:22,660 --> 01:25:24,870
You don't have to know this.

1182
01:25:25,496 --> 01:25:29,583
General, it is my job
to ensure the safety of this mission.

1183
01:25:29,750 --> 01:25:33,379
Anything that affects it is my business.
Now what the hell is Destiny?

1184
01:25:33,546 --> 01:25:35,422
It's a device.

1185
01:25:35,589 --> 01:25:41,137
Deep Earth Seismic Trigger
Initiative, DEST-INI. Destiny.

1186
01:25:42,471 --> 01:25:45,558
We had reason to believe that our
enemies were building a weapon

1187
01:25:45,724 --> 01:25:47,977
that could generate
targeted seismic events.

1188
01:25:49,395 --> 01:25:53,274
They would be able to create massive
earthquakes under our territory.

1189
01:25:53,440 --> 01:25:55,067
- No way of telling who did it.
- So?

1190
01:25:55,234 --> 01:25:57,027
So... we built one, too.

1191
01:25:57,903 --> 01:26:01,490
M.A.D. Mutually Assured Destruction.

1192
01:26:01,657 --> 01:26:03,534
A perfect acronym
if ever there was one.

1193
01:26:03,701 --> 01:26:05,411
- Beautiful.
- They built it first.

1194
01:26:05,578 --> 01:26:07,788
I built it better.
I beamed high-powered

1195
01:26:07,955 --> 01:26:10,624
electromagnetic energy waves
down Deep Earth fault lines,

1196
01:26:10,791 --> 01:26:13,460
- and, you know.
- Zimsky, what makes you think

1197
01:26:13,627 --> 01:26:17,089
- that Destiny would touch the core?
- [Josh] 'Cause it already did.

1198
01:26:19,049 --> 01:26:22,761
This isn't a fluke.
We killed the planet.

1199
01:26:22,928 --> 01:26:24,847
[Beck] You keep saying
that the core is too big

1200
01:26:25,014 --> 01:26:26,682
to be affected by anything
short of nukes.

1201
01:26:26,849 --> 01:26:28,642
- So...
- The core is an engine.

1202
01:26:28,809 --> 01:26:31,395
Throw a small wrench into a big engine,
you can still stall it.

1203
01:26:33,981 --> 01:26:35,691
<i>Deep Earth, this is Virgil.</i>

1204
01:26:35,858 --> 01:26:40,154
We require clarification on
the status of Project Destiny.

1205
01:26:40,738 --> 01:26:43,991
- Why weren't we notified of this, sir?
- Because you didn't need to know.

1206
01:26:45,618 --> 01:26:47,953
<i>Now you may not like this.
I may not like it either.</i>

1207
01:26:48,120 --> 01:26:50,623
But it's my job,
and I do it for my country,

1208
01:26:50,789 --> 01:26:53,417
and if we don't develop these
devices, someone worse will

1209
01:26:53,584 --> 01:26:56,462
and they will use them against us.
But you have my word.

1210
01:26:56,629 --> 01:26:59,506
No one in this
administration, no one,

1211
01:27:00,216 --> 01:27:01,967
had any idea
that this could happen.

1212
01:27:02,134 --> 01:27:05,512
So the device that killed the
planet is your backup plan?

1213
01:27:05,679 --> 01:27:09,850
An electric shock can stop a heart.
It can certainly restart one.

1214
01:27:10,017 --> 01:27:13,812
- Destiny will work. It has to.
- No, it won't work.

1215
01:27:13,979 --> 01:27:16,190
If you fire that thing again
with the core already stalled,

1216
01:27:16,357 --> 01:27:18,108
- it'll terminally destabilise it.
- Yes, granted,

1217
01:27:18,275 --> 01:27:20,903
there is a marginal risk involved,
but given the circumstances,

1218
01:27:21,070 --> 01:27:23,280
- I hardly see that as an alternative.
- No, Zimsky, listen to me.

1219
01:27:23,447 --> 01:27:24,907
Every volcano on the planet will blow.

1220
01:27:25,074 --> 01:27:27,034
There'll be earthquakes big
enough to rip us to pieces.

1221
01:27:27,201 --> 01:27:28,577
- <i>[Tom] Dr. Keyes.</i>
- What?

1222
01:27:28,744 --> 01:27:31,455
I'm afraid it's all we've got.

1223
01:27:31,622 --> 01:27:34,917
Now, I have orders from the president.
Come home, <i>Virgil.</i> We go to plan B.

1224
01:27:35,084 --> 01:27:37,628
- Well, what about plan C?
- What? What?

1225
01:27:38,170 --> 01:27:42,549
Well, plan C. We continue on.
We restart the core... somehow.

1226
01:27:42,716 --> 01:27:45,261
We don't do it, you fire Destiny.

1227
01:27:45,427 --> 01:27:46,720
I can't wait for you
to get out of there.

1228
01:27:46,887 --> 01:27:49,974
- Then don't. We fail, fire Destiny.
- Oh, come on! That's ridiculous!

1229
01:27:50,140 --> 01:27:52,017
- What choice do we have, Zimsky?
- Are you kidding me?

1230
01:27:52,184 --> 01:27:54,520
If they set that thing off,
the shock waves will wipe us out!

1231
01:27:54,687 --> 01:27:56,814
We'll be lucky to get back
if we turn back right now!

1232
01:27:56,981 --> 01:28:00,150
Virgil, I'm telling you right now,
we will fire Destiny,

1233
01:28:00,317 --> 01:28:02,236
and we need to do so
as quickly as possible,

1234
01:28:02,403 --> 01:28:05,572
and if you're still there,
you will be destroyed.

1235
01:28:06,407 --> 01:28:07,366
<i>Rebecca ?</i>

1236
01:28:08,117 --> 01:28:09,868
Please don't make me
have to do this.

1237
01:28:16,041 --> 01:28:17,626
Plan C.

1238
01:28:20,504 --> 01:28:21,964
It's your call, Commander.

1239
01:28:27,970 --> 01:28:30,139
Majority decision.

1240
01:28:30,306 --> 01:28:32,808
We're going in.

1241
01:28:32,975 --> 01:28:34,226
I'm sorry, sir.

1242
01:28:37,104 --> 01:28:40,441
Oh, come on, you're a bunch of suicidal
morons! What are you, crazy?

1243
01:28:40,607 --> 01:28:43,068
Plan C?
Restart the core "somehow"?

1244
01:28:43,235 --> 01:28:45,821
Oh, that's a great idea!
That's a brilliant idea!

1245
01:28:45,988 --> 01:28:48,490
I can't believe I'm stuck in this
floating septic tank with you lunatics!

1246
01:28:48,657 --> 01:28:50,993
You may have nothing to lose.
You may have nothing to lose!

1247
01:28:51,160 --> 01:28:53,078
You may have nothing to lose,
but I have my life to lose,

1248
01:28:53,245 --> 01:28:55,414
thank you very much,
while you're up! Now turn it around!

1249
01:28:55,581 --> 01:28:57,124
He told us to go back
and we're going back!

1250
01:28:57,291 --> 01:28:59,001
Why? You want to be a hero?
You want to be a martyr?

1251
01:28:59,168 --> 01:29:00,878
What do you want to be?
You're out of your mind!

1252
01:29:01,045 --> 01:29:02,671
- Thank you! Turn it around!
- No!

1253
01:29:02,838 --> 01:29:03,881
- Zimsky.
- I'm not gonna die like this!

1254
01:29:04,048 --> 01:29:06,675
- I don't wanna die!
- Zimsky, it's not about you!

1255
01:29:06,842 --> 01:29:08,969
- If you wanna die like this...
- ...three people...

1256
01:29:09,136 --> 01:29:10,846
Shut up!

1257
01:29:14,850 --> 01:29:16,268
[panting]

1258
01:29:16,435 --> 01:29:18,228
It's not a stupid ship.

1259
01:29:20,064 --> 01:29:21,398
I had to.

1260
01:29:25,361 --> 01:29:27,821
- It had to happen sometime.
- Yeah.

1261
01:29:33,535 --> 01:29:35,454
- [computer beeping]
- Um...

1262
01:29:35,621 --> 01:29:38,332
- Status! What is that?
- [Rat] It's the EM monitoring station.

1263
01:29:38,499 --> 01:29:40,459
It's the one that tracks EM pulses.

1264
01:29:40,626 --> 01:29:43,087
God, no.

1265
01:29:44,004 --> 01:29:45,422
[sighs]

1266
01:29:46,840 --> 01:29:48,217
- Just talk, Mr. Rat.
- [Rat] No.

1267
01:29:48,384 --> 01:29:51,011
- That's a good boy.
- Um...

1268
01:29:51,178 --> 01:29:54,640
Remember those invisible microwaves
that Josh was talking about?

1269
01:29:54,807 --> 01:29:57,810
Well, they just found a hole.

1270
01:30:15,869 --> 01:30:17,913
[water boiling]

1271
01:30:37,641 --> 01:30:39,435
No, it's a parking lot out here...

1272
01:30:39,601 --> 01:30:41,186
- [sizzling sound]
- [screams]

1273
01:30:46,233 --> 01:30:49,027

OK, OK, OK. Let's try again.

- Your torque is R, cross F...
- No, your R is too small, Josh.

- Right.
- Wait, hold on.

- No, I mean,

01:34:06,475 --> 01:34:08,560
it took me and 400
of the world's smartest people

1322
01:34:08,727 --> 01:34:10,646
- to come up with the first plan.
- You want to help?

1323
01:34:10,812 --> 01:34:13,357
No. I want to turn around and go home.

1324
01:34:13,523 --> 01:34:16,777
- It's not going to happen.
- Well, then we're going to die.

1325
01:34:18,070 --> 01:34:19,404
- True.
- All right, look

1326
01:34:19,571 --> 01:34:21,073
- let's start from square one.
- OK.

1327
01:34:21,239 --> 01:34:25,243
Let's start from square one. The bulk
modules... depends on density.

1328
01:34:25,410 --> 01:34:30,832
Your torque is R cross F,
but you have to integrate volume...

1329
01:34:30,999 --> 01:34:35,045
But here, here...
just consider this.

1330
01:34:37,756 --> 01:34:39,049
Now, we got this...

1331
01:34:39,216 --> 01:34:43,178
OK, now, R cross F,
we're putting put in pi. What's V?

1332
01:34:44,888 --> 01:34:47,724
- Oh, for God's sake!
- All right. I'm hitting him again.

1333
01:34:47,891 --> 01:34:50,894
No, no, no!
Braz, no, look, I have a theory.

1334
01:34:51,853 --> 01:34:54,022
- Are you interested?
- Yes. We're interested.

1335
01:34:54,815 --> 01:34:57,067
Then let me smoke a cigarette,
and I'll tell you.

1336
01:35:06,576 --> 01:35:09,037
- Oh, thank God.
- [Braz whistles]

1337
01:35:09,204 --> 01:35:13,625
Hm? All right, fine, look. Look,
we have to use wave interference, OK?

1338
01:35:13,792 --> 01:35:16,586
Because one explosion won't do it.
Think about stones in a pond.

1339
01:35:16,753 --> 01:35:19,798
You drop a large stone into a pond,
you get a big splash,

1340
01:35:19,965 --> 01:35:21,425
and then that's it, it's over.

1341
01:35:21,591 --> 01:35:25,303
But drop a smaller stone,
wait until the ripples weaken

1342
01:35:25,470 --> 01:35:28,098
and drop another and another,
and another,

1343
01:35:28,265 --> 01:35:30,642
and fluid dynamics 101.

1344
01:35:31,435 --> 01:35:34,312
The ripples reinforce each other
in geometric progression.

1345
01:35:34,479 --> 01:35:36,231
[Braz] The whole bigger than
the sum of the parts.

1346
01:35:36,398 --> 01:35:39,484
Then we'll have five
200 megaton explosions...

1347
01:35:39,651 --> 01:35:41,069
Instead of one big bang.

1348
01:35:41,236 --> 01:35:44,698
- [Josh] So, we hotwire the nukes.
- Yes.

1349
01:35:44,865 --> 01:35:47,033
As one does.
We seed them through the core

1350
01:35:47,200 --> 01:35:50,078
at locations that have
to be accurate to the inch.

1351
01:35:50,245 --> 01:35:52,998
We detonate them in a sequence
that has to be accurate

1352
01:35:53,165 --> 01:35:54,416
to the millisecond,

1353
01:35:54,583 --> 01:35:58,837
then we outrun the biggest
nuclear shock wave in history.

1354
01:35:59,379 --> 01:36:01,381
- Right.
- Yeah.

1355
01:36:02,674 --> 01:36:04,801
I mean, that should be fairly simple.

1356
01:36:05,927 --> 01:36:07,888
[alarm blaring]

1357
01:36:12,434 --> 01:36:15,020
[man 1] ...should now be
diverting to the central...

1358
01:36:15,187 --> 01:36:18,023
[man 2] Final calibration
on both transmission systems...

1359
01:36:18,190 --> 01:36:19,191
[indistinct chatter]

1360
01:36:23,695 --> 01:36:25,280
[computer beeps]

1361
01:36:26,364 --> 01:36:30,118
Cut the... cut the rouge.
The red wire above the circuit.

1362
01:36:30,285 --> 01:36:32,204
- OK. OK.
- No, no, wait, hold it!

1363
01:36:32,370 --> 01:36:33,538
I'm sorry, cut it below.

1364
01:36:36,374 --> 01:36:39,711
- [computer beeps]
- I don't know what that means.

1365
01:36:44,049 --> 01:36:45,550
[man 1] Extensions A, B.

1366
01:36:45,717 --> 01:36:48,887
- [man 2] Here we go.
- [man 1] F, check. Increase power

1367
01:36:49,054 --> 01:36:51,014
- to reactors ten through 15.
- We're almost there, folks.

1368
01:36:51,181 --> 01:36:52,599
[typing]

1369
01:37:10,116 --> 01:37:11,785
[computer beeping]

1370
01:37:19,876 --> 01:37:23,255
- [typing]
- [beeping continues]

1371
01:37:44,317 --> 01:37:46,111
[Beck] OK, guys we're closing
on the inner core.

1372
01:37:46,278 --> 01:37:47,946
The nukes are ready.
Timers are on.

1373
01:37:49,573 --> 01:37:52,742
- Great. Let's start dropping them.
- No. The bombs are not built

1374
01:37:52,909 --> 01:37:55,078
for these pressures.
That's why they were in that pod.

1375
01:37:55,245 --> 01:37:56,413
If you send them out now,

1376
01:37:56,580 --> 01:37:58,290
out of that casing,
they'll be crushed instantly.

1377
01:37:58,456 --> 01:38:01,459
- I'm assuming we have a Plan D.
- Plan D is Virgil's compartments.

1378
01:38:01,626 --> 01:38:03,461
We put a nuke in
each section of Virgil,

1379
01:38:03,628 --> 01:38:06,506
and then eject the individual sections
one at a time. They should stay intact

1380
01:38:06,673 --> 01:38:08,758
- long enough for the nuke to go off.
- [groans]

1381
01:38:10,594 --> 01:38:12,804
- What?
- Virgil's not designed

1382
01:38:12,971 --> 01:38:15,056
to eject undamaged compartments.

1383
01:38:15,223 --> 01:38:19,436
OK, these are the ejection mechanisms
holding each compartment in place, um...

1384
01:38:20,103 --> 01:38:23,815
They're all connected
by one master hydraulic gear, um,

1385
01:38:23,982 --> 01:38:25,442
kind of like keys on a key ring.

1386
01:38:25,609 --> 01:38:28,278
What we have to do,
we have to unlock the piston.

1387
01:38:28,445 --> 01:38:31,948
That will release the compartments
so the bombs can be jettisoned.

1388
01:38:32,115 --> 01:38:33,325
Where's the master gear?

1389
01:38:33,909 --> 01:38:36,202
In the crawl space
we used to get out earlier.

1390
01:38:36,369 --> 01:38:37,495
Well, what the hell is it doing there?

1391
01:38:37,662 --> 01:38:39,164
I built the ship
in three damn months.

1392
01:38:39,331 --> 01:38:41,875
I didn't think I'd be intentionally
sabotaging it. I'm sorry!

1393
01:38:42,500 --> 01:38:43,710
So one of us has to go in there.

1394
01:38:43,877 --> 01:38:45,337
- Correct.
- Into the crawl space

1395
01:38:45,503 --> 01:38:47,881
- that has core fluid at 9,000 degrees.
- [Braz] Yes.

1396
01:38:48,048 --> 01:38:49,299
Can you flush it
with liquid nitrogen?

1397
01:38:49,466 --> 01:38:50,800
[Braz] We don't have
enough at this point.

1398
01:38:50,967 --> 01:38:54,137
9,000 degrees.
And our suits are built to withstand...?

1399
01:38:54,763 --> 01:38:56,765
- Half that, probably.
- Right. Half that.

1400
01:38:56,932 --> 01:38:58,516
So, what you're saying
is whoever goes into that crawl space,

1401
01:38:58,683 --> 01:39:00,477
is not coming back.

1402
01:39:10,737 --> 01:39:13,198
- Together.
- Yes, thank you.

1403
01:39:13,365 --> 01:39:14,658
Wait.

1404
01:39:14,824 --> 01:39:15,951
- On three.
- OK.

1405
01:39:16,117 --> 01:39:19,371
One... two... three.

1406
01:39:28,922 --> 01:39:30,382
Huh.

1407
01:39:31,591 --> 01:39:36,054
Well, I better go on, get myself ready.

1408
01:39:37,722 --> 01:39:39,849
No, Braz, wait.
No, Braz. Excuse me.

1409
01:39:40,016 --> 01:39:41,059
Just a moment, may I see that?

1410
01:39:41,226 --> 01:39:42,852
- No.
- May I? May I?

1411
01:39:43,019 --> 01:39:45,230
- Yes.
- Thank you.

1412
01:39:46,147 --> 01:39:49,943
- Magic.
- I mean, Braz,

1413
01:39:51,152 --> 01:39:52,779
three straws of equal length.

1414
01:39:52,946 --> 01:39:55,782
I mean, this is childish.
Let's do it again.

1415
01:39:55,949 --> 01:39:59,494
No, we will not do it again. [laughs]
I thought you'd be happy.

1416
01:40:00,036 --> 01:40:02,580
No. Not at the expense
of you making us look like fools.

1417
01:40:02,747 --> 01:40:04,290
He's right. Why do you get dibs
on being the hero?

1418
01:40:04,457 --> 01:40:06,626
- Because it's my damn ship.
- Oh, that makes perfect sense.

1419
01:40:06,793 --> 01:40:11,006
Look, for 20 years, I've done
nothing but Virgil, 20 years.

1420
01:40:11,172 --> 01:40:14,175
<i>Virgil</i> belongs to me,
and I will not let her fail.

1421
01:40:14,342 --> 01:40:19,597
I will not. Now if you want to know
what's worth dying for... this ship.

1422
01:40:19,764 --> 01:40:22,642
Building it instead of imagining it.

1423
01:40:22,809 --> 01:40:26,187
If <i>Virgil</i> needs more blood,
it will be my blood.

1424
01:40:27,939 --> 01:40:29,858
Now I am going to go and get ready.

1425
01:40:41,870 --> 01:40:42,954
Good to go.

1426
01:40:48,376 --> 01:40:51,629
Beck. Josh.

1427
01:40:54,049 --> 01:40:56,551
It's a hell of a boat you built, Braz.

1428
01:40:56,718 --> 01:41:00,930
I am really proud to
have known you guys.

1429
01:41:01,097 --> 01:41:03,141
[Josh] Thank you.

1430
01:41:23,703 --> 01:41:27,332
Braz. Edward.

1431
01:41:29,209 --> 01:41:31,211
Yes, Conrad?

1432
01:41:31,377 --> 01:41:34,672
You're right. It is your ship.

1433
01:41:36,508 --> 01:41:38,718
But I wish to God it had been ours.

1434
01:41:54,984 --> 01:41:56,236
[whooshing]

1435
01:41:56,402 --> 01:41:58,196
[beeping]

1436
01:42:02,408 --> 01:42:04,786
The chamber's sealed, Beck.

1437
01:42:04,953 --> 01:42:06,913
Ready.

1438
01:42:10,208 --> 01:42:12,127
<i>Open the hatch.</i>

1439
01:42:16,089 --> 01:42:17,298

[sizzling]

1443
01:42:50,373 --> 01:42:51,875
Hang on, Braz.

1444
01:42:53,001 --> 01:42:54,085
Come on, hang on.

1445
01:43:37,629 --> 01:43:38,713
[glass shattering]

[computer beeping]

1447
01:43:48,598 --> 01:43:51,017
Manual override is complete!
Braz, we can still get you out of there.

1448
01:43:53,978 --> 01:43:58,483
No... Start... start the impeller.

1449
01:44:01,569 --> 01:44:02,946
No.

1450
01:44:10,954 --> 01:44:12,747
[panting]

1451
01:44:31,474 --> 01:44:33,810
We got a job to do. Let's do it.

1452
01:44:35,144 --> 01:44:36,396
Let's go.

1453
01:44:38,564 --> 01:44:40,483
[man] Magnetic shielding systems are up.

1454
01:44:40,650 --> 01:44:42,360
- Power level's 85 per cent.
- [computers beeping]

1455
01:44:42,527 --> 01:44:45,822
- Increase power to Reactor ten.
- All personnel should be clear.

[Zimsky, Josh shouting]

1458
01:45:01,754 --> 01:45:04,382
[Zimsky] Oh, God! Oh, I'm sorry.

1459
01:45:08,511 --> 01:45:10,596
- [both grunting]
- OK, she's down.

<i>[Beck] Approaching the first
drop-off point.</i>

1461
01:45:13,474 --> 01:45:15,310
We got to be accurate
to the second here, boys.

1462
01:45:17,353 --> 01:45:19,772
And drop in three-five seconds.

1463
01:45:19,939 --> 01:45:22,942
And... timer on.

1464
01:45:23,109 --> 01:45:24,652
- Pull it.
- [timer beeping]

1465
01:45:29,324 --> 01:45:32,452
Clear... and... ejecting.

1466

[telephone ringing]

1467
01:45:39,834 --> 01:45:42,920
- All right. Initiate firing sequence.
- Sir...

1468
01:45:43,087 --> 01:45:45,173
It's our last shot, Stick.

1469
01:45:46,799 --> 01:45:49,719
- Damn you.
- Damn me? Too late.

01:45:49,886 --> 01:45:53,306
<i>[man] Ten, nine, eight...</i>

1471
01:45:54,766 --> 01:45:56,851
[Rat] What's that?

1472
01:46:00,938 --> 01:46:02,231
Gotcha!

1473
01:46:02,398 --> 01:46:06,402
- [man 1] ...four, three, two...
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!

1474
01:46:06,569 --> 01:46:09,989
Someone's diverted our energy.
Where the hell's it gone?!

1475
01:46:10,156 --> 01:46:11,366
It looks like...

1476
01:46:13,451 --> 01:46:15,119
Coney Island.

1477
01:46:17,497 --> 01:46:19,874
Your kung fu is not strong.

1478
01:46:20,041 --> 01:46:22,460
Well, how long will it take
to get it back online?

1479
01:46:23,086 --> 01:46:25,296
Well, then get to it!

1480
01:46:33,221 --> 01:46:36,641
Oh, hey, General.
Is there something I can do for you?

1481
01:46:36,808 --> 01:46:38,684
- Mm.
- [computer game beeping]

1482
01:46:41,562 --> 01:46:43,856
- Timer on.
- [timer beeping]

1483
01:46:44,816 --> 01:46:46,484
Clear... ejecting.

1484
01:46:54,033 --> 01:46:55,034
Ejecting.

1485
01:46:58,287 --> 01:47:00,498
Pull it.

1486
01:47:00,665 --> 01:47:01,916
All right.

1487
01:47:02,083 --> 01:47:05,545
Let's go throw our last little
200 megaton stone in the pond.

1488
01:47:05,711 --> 01:47:07,672
I always wanted to make a splash
in nuclear physics.

1489
01:47:07,839 --> 01:47:09,674
You know, that energy propagation stuff
you were talking about...

1490
01:47:09,841 --> 01:47:11,175
- Oh, that was high school physics.
- Yeah, it's not exactly...

1491
01:47:11,342 --> 01:47:13,511
I just took the wavelengths from the
core fluid off the MRI readings.

1492
01:47:13,678 --> 01:47:16,139
- Yeah, and multiplied by 800...
- Six hundred.

1493
01:47:16,973 --> 01:47:21,436
Surely you compensated
for the MRI bias.

1494
01:47:21,602 --> 01:47:22,979
We got to reset the timers!

1495
01:47:24,981 --> 01:47:26,566
[Zimsky] It's not the timers!
No! It just won't work.

1496
01:47:26,732 --> 01:47:28,484
It's not the timers!
This is not enough!

1497
01:47:28,651 --> 01:47:30,695
- What's not enough?
- The last bomb is not enough.

1498
01:47:30,862 --> 01:47:32,155
- To complete the wave form.
- Yeah. No.

1499
01:47:32,321 --> 01:47:34,157
The last bomb has
to be 30 per cent larger.

1500
01:47:34,323 --> 01:47:36,200
That's six or seven pounds
of plutonium.

1501
01:47:36,367 --> 01:47:38,286
Where are we going to get six
or seven pounds of plutonium?

1502
01:47:43,082 --> 01:47:44,459
Ahh!

1503
01:47:45,835 --> 01:47:49,714
Guys, we got hit by an energy flare.
I can't keep us on course.

1505
01:47:51,757 --> 01:47:55,261
- No, Beck! No, wait! No! Push it!
- You push it!

1506
01:47:55,428 --> 01:47:57,138
Come on, guys, I can't hear you.

1507
01:47:59,265 --> 01:48:01,893
- It's got my shoulder! Ahh!
- Push!

1508
01:48:02,059 --> 01:48:03,978
<i>Guys! Clear!</i>

1509
01:48:04,145 --> 01:48:05,688
Clear the compartment!
What are you doing?

1510
01:48:05,855 --> 01:48:07,356
<i>I think the flare
has knocked the come out.</i>

1511
01:48:07,523 --> 01:48:10,151
- I can't get it, Josh. I can't get it.
- Go...

1512
01:48:10,318 --> 01:48:12,904
- I can't.
- OK.

1513
01:48:13,070 --> 01:48:17,700
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- Can you hear me?

1514
01:48:17,867 --> 01:48:19,952

01:49:25,101 --> 01:49:26,686
Beck, can you hear me?

1533
01:49:26,852 --> 01:49:28,980
Beck, if you have any better
ideas, you tell me now.

1534
01:49:29,814 --> 01:49:33,234
We've only have three minutes
to eject this one. Beck!

1535
01:49:34,694 --> 01:49:36,571
Come on, guys. I can't hear you.

1536
01:49:39,240 --> 01:49:40,950

- Please.

01:51:41,987 --> 01:51:44,073

- I'm sorry.
- Hold on, let me get...

1554
01:51:47,118 --> 01:51:49,662
No. Stay here for one second.

1555
01:51:49,829 --> 01:51:52,123
I was trying to call you.

1556
01:51:52,289 --> 01:51:55,751
- I know. The coms were down.
- Right.

1557
01:51:57,002 --> 01:51:59,714
- I know what you did.
- We don't have enough energy...

1558
01:51:59,880 --> 01:52:02,133
- I know.
- ...to get back.

1559
01:52:02,299 --> 01:52:03,634
You did good.

1560
01:52:03,801 --> 01:52:06,303
I would've done the same thing.

1561
01:52:07,972 --> 01:52:09,682
Where's Zimsky?

1562
01:52:11,892 --> 01:52:13,686
Come here.

1563
01:52:15,104 --> 01:52:16,397
You did good.

1564
01:52:19,150 --> 01:52:20,818
You did good.

1565
01:52:33,038 --> 01:52:36,500
[exhales] One minute
to the first detonation.

1566
01:52:36,667 --> 01:52:39,336
And 12 until the blast hits us.

1567
01:52:43,966 --> 01:52:46,761
I was hoping we'd
suffocate to death first.

Beck, Beck.

1571
01:53:27,218 --> 01:53:30,429
What could you do if I got you enough
power to fire the impeller?

1572
01:53:30,596 --> 01:53:31,931
Maybe not the laser, but the impeller.

1573
01:53:32,097 --> 01:53:35,309
- What? From where?
- The heat of the core.

1574
01:53:35,476 --> 01:53:39,271
It's 9,000 degrees.
Unobtanium converts heat to energy.

1575
01:53:39,438 --> 01:53:42,608
So this whole damn ship
is like a big old solar panel.

1576
01:53:42,775 --> 01:53:44,485
Come on, I need your help.

1577
01:53:51,992 --> 01:53:55,913
- Number two's going!
- Come on, come on.

1578
01:54:12,638 --> 01:54:17,309
For here in the
great infinite unknowable...

1579
01:54:17,476 --> 01:54:21,897

important thing of all:

Himself.

1581
01:54:25,109 --> 01:54:26,861
He can understand...

1582
01:54:28,779 --> 01:54:31,490
What the fuck am I doing?

1583
01:54:32,741 --> 01:54:34,577
[chuckles]

1584
01:55:08,360 --> 01:55:11,614

[cheering]

1586
01:55:20,456 --> 01:55:22,082
All right!

1587
01:55:22,875 --> 01:55:25,002
[cheering continues]

1588
01:55:30,549 --> 01:55:32,384
[Josh] Come on, Beck, where is it?

1589
01:55:34,011 --> 01:55:37,348
Come on. Come on, hurry up.
Is that the last one?

1590
01:55:37,514 --> 01:55:39,767
Yeah.

1591
01:55:47,149 --> 01:55:48,275
Give it a couple seconds.

1592
01:55:48,442 --> 01:55:50,569
- [zap]
- [beeping]

1593
01:55:58,535 --> 01:56:00,704
It worked!

1594
01:56:13,550 --> 01:56:16,053
Get ready to pull a few G's.

1595
01:56:34,113 --> 01:56:36,782
- Four hundred twenty knots.
- Now, this is more like it.

1596
01:56:36,949 --> 01:56:37,825
Four-forty.

1597
01:56:45,457 --> 01:56:47,835
Mr. Rat, what's the
centre of this quake?

1598
01:56:48,002 --> 01:56:50,337
It's everywhere!
It's one giant shock wave!

1599
01:56:50,504 --> 01:56:52,381
The planet's healing itself.

1600
01:56:55,259 --> 01:56:58,429
At this speed, we're going to be home
in a third of the time.

1601
01:57:30,044 --> 01:57:32,212
As long as we can surf
these magma flows, we'll be OK.

1602
01:57:32,379 --> 01:57:34,673
Let's just pray we don't run
into any dead ends,

1603
01:57:34,840 --> 01:57:37,593
or we're going to miss those lasers.

1604
01:57:40,304 --> 01:57:42,973
OK, navigator, which way?

1605
01:57:43,140 --> 01:57:44,558
We've got greater
flow density on the left.

1606
01:57:44,725 --> 01:57:46,310
Go with the flow.

1607
01:58:07,956 --> 01:58:10,542
- [beeping]
- Bill, where are they headed?

1608
01:58:10,709 --> 01:58:11,835
Looks like she found
a space between

1609
01:58:12,002 --> 01:58:15,047
some tectonic plates
somewhere near Hawaii.

1610
01:58:20,719 --> 01:58:22,012
- Josh...
- Yeah?

1611
01:58:22,179 --> 01:58:23,263
They're closing in on us too fast.

1612
01:58:23,430 --> 01:58:26,391
- I don't know if I can...
- Beck, you got it.

1613
01:58:37,361 --> 01:58:39,238
[beeping]

1614
01:58:41,573 --> 01:58:43,742
Um... [stammers]

1615
01:58:43,909 --> 01:58:47,162
We lost them, Stick, and I...

1616
01:59:07,933 --> 01:59:09,810
[Beck] Where'd our power go?

1617
01:59:11,228 --> 01:59:13,772
[Josh] We were powered by the heat.

1618
01:59:13,939 --> 01:59:15,607
It's stone cold down here.

1619
01:59:18,152 --> 01:59:19,778
Well...

1620
01:59:19,945 --> 01:59:21,905
Look on the bright side.

1621
01:59:23,657 --> 01:59:25,784
At least we're not
going to boil to death.

1622
01:59:25,951 --> 01:59:28,745
- You always look on the bright side?
- Always.

1623
01:59:30,956 --> 01:59:32,291
OK, let's assess:

1624
01:59:35,294 --> 01:59:39,756
We've got no communications,
we're probably 800 feet down,

1625
01:59:39,923 --> 01:59:41,842
but we might as well be 800 miles.

1626
01:59:42,843 --> 01:59:44,636
We're in an Unobtanium

1627
01:59:44,803 --> 01:59:47,347
cigar tube with the sonar
signature of a rock.

1628
01:59:47,514 --> 01:59:50,684
We've got just enough power
to make the ultrasonics burp,

1629
01:59:50,851 --> 01:59:54,229
but no one's listening
on those frequencies anyway, and...

1630
01:59:55,230 --> 01:59:56,899
...nobody even knows we're alive.

1631
02:00:02,654 --> 02:00:04,823
OK.

1632
02:00:04,990 --> 02:00:07,201
Give me a minute on this one.

1633
02:00:23,967 --> 02:00:25,427
This is hopeless.

1634
02:00:25,594 --> 02:00:27,971
Come on, General, we've got to be
getting close. We can't...

1635
02:00:28,138 --> 02:00:31,808
Mr. Rat, even if they were still alive,
there's no way they could contact us.

1636
02:00:31,975 --> 02:00:33,143
[telephone rings]

1637
02:00:33,310 --> 02:00:35,020
Bridge.

1638
02:00:35,729 --> 02:00:37,814
Skipper, Combat relays that our
sub has something on the sonar.

1639
02:00:37,981 --> 02:00:40,400
- Where do they think?
- Bill, put it up on the hydrophone.

1640
02:00:42,277 --> 02:00:44,321
[whale sounds]

1641
02:00:45,989 --> 02:00:46,990
Whales, sir.

1642
02:00:47,157 --> 02:00:50,577
They're a long way off their usual path,
but that's not uncommon since that...

1643
02:00:50,744 --> 02:00:52,829
What are they calling it?
Orbital wobble?

1644
02:00:52,996 --> 02:00:55,207
Yeah, that's what they call it.

1645
02:00:55,374 --> 02:00:59,461
Well, thank you very much, Captain,
but I think we're done here.

1646
02:00:59,628 --> 02:01:01,004
General.

1647
02:01:03,840 --> 02:01:08,011
J.O., this is the captain.
Stand down from SAR Operations.

1648
02:01:39,543 --> 02:01:42,379
It's whales! It's whales!

1649
02:01:42,546 --> 02:01:46,383
Hey! General! Stick!

1650
02:01:46,550 --> 02:01:49,428
It's whales! The ultrasonics!

1651
02:01:49,594 --> 02:01:53,307
They're singing to them!
You gotta find the whales!

1652
02:02:11,616 --> 02:02:14,161
[man] Alpha X Ray, this is
November Echo six one zero.

1653
02:02:14,328 --> 02:02:17,831
I'm changing...
Hold on, I'm seeing those whales now.

1654
02:02:17,998 --> 02:02:20,834
Whoa! OK, ball's in the water.

1655
02:02:21,001 --> 02:02:23,628
This is neat. Those whales
are circling something.

1656
02:02:23,795 --> 02:02:26,256
Hold on, hold on.
We have a strong echo here.

1657
02:02:26,423 --> 02:02:28,925
Depth, 800 feet.
There's something down there.

1658
02:02:29,092 --> 02:02:31,011
There's definitely
something down there.

1659
02:03:14,638 --> 02:03:17,140
I told you pulsing the
ultrasonics would work.

1660
02:03:17,307 --> 02:03:19,518
Do you ever get tired
of being right?

1661
02:03:20,519 --> 02:03:22,229
Yes.

1662
02:03:22,979 --> 02:03:25,148
So, what's next for you?

1663
02:03:25,816 --> 02:03:28,235
- A shower.
- [laughs]

1664
02:03:28,985 --> 02:03:32,155
Then back to NASA, I guess.

1665
02:03:32,322 --> 02:03:33,782
You?

1666
02:03:33,949 --> 02:03:37,494
Deep-dish pepperoni pizza,
green peppers, onions,

1667
02:03:37,661 --> 02:03:40,205
- extra mushrooms, then a shower...
- Mmm.

1668
02:03:40,372 --> 02:03:42,874
...and then back to the classroom.

1669
02:03:43,792 --> 02:03:46,169
NASA could use
a few good men, you know.

1670
02:03:48,839 --> 02:03:53,427
Yeah. Unfortunately, so could my
freshmen geophysics students.

1671
02:03:58,348 --> 02:04:02,144
You know what makes me
really, really angry?

1672
02:04:02,310 --> 02:04:05,814
Bob, Serge, Braz, Zimsky...

1673
02:04:05,981 --> 02:04:08,984
No one's going to ever know
what they did or why they died.

1674
02:04:12,112 --> 02:04:16,450
Unless... it all got out somehow.

1675
02:04:19,536 --> 02:04:23,665
- That's unthinkable.
- Yeah.

1676

1677
02:04:58,617 --> 02:05:01,620
[cracks knuckles] OK, here we go.

02:05:02,370 --> 02:05:04,706
[beeping]

1679
02:05:04,873 --> 02:05:07,125
- [all computers beeping]
- [people murmuring]

1680
02:05:10,795 --> 02:05:12,839
Sweet.

1681
02:05:25,435 --> 02:05:28,438
<i>[woman] It is now emerging that
the world owes its survival</i>

1682
02:05:28,605 --> 02:05:31,733
<i>to the heroism of six
remarkable individuals:</i>

1683
02:05:31,900 --> 02:05:33,777
<i>- Shuttle Commander Robert Iverson...
- [man 1] This extraordinary craft...</i>

1684
02:05:33,944 --> 02:05:35,278
<i>[woman] ...French Scientist,
Dr. Serge...</i>

1685
02:05:35,445 --> 02:05:37,948
<i>[man 1] ...was captained
by NASA astronaut Dr. Bob Iverson.</i>

1686
02:05:38,114 --> 02:05:39,533
<i>[man 2] Edward Brazzelton is a name...</i>

1687
02:05:39,699 --> 02:05:42,285
<i>[man 3] ...Dr. Conrad Zimsky
will be best remembered...</i>

1688
02:05:42,452 --> 02:05:45,455
<i>[man 4] On Capitol Hill today,
everyone's asking the same question:</i>

1689
02:05:45,622 --> 02:05:48,166
<i>What is Project Destiny?</i>

1690
02:05:48,333 --> 02:05:50,961
<i>[reporters overlapping]</i>

1691
02:05:51,127 --> 02:05:53,338
Destiny, meet world.

1692
02:05:53,505 --> 02:05:56,007
World, meet Destiny.

1693
02:05:57,133 --> 02:06:00,220
<i>[man] Dr. Brazzelton, Dr. Zimsky...</i>

1694
02:06:00,387 --> 02:06:03,056
<i>[reporters fade]</i>

1695
