00:18:34,232 --> 00:18:35,233

No.

I had a feeling
you'd say that.

You could have been
one of us.

out of here.

I thought
you would never ask.

Sorry I had to play rough
with you guys,

what this could do,

I had to make Blood
trust me.

were brainwashed,

why not you?

402
00:21:21,899 --> 00:21:24,401
Because half my brain
is electronic.

He may have been able
to fool the man,

404
00:21:26,439 --> 00:21:28,173
but he couldn't fool
the machine.

405
00:21:28,208 --> 00:21:29,907
Which means,
next time we face him,

406
00:21:29,942 --> 00:21:32,910
we have our own
secret weapon.

high school because of this.
