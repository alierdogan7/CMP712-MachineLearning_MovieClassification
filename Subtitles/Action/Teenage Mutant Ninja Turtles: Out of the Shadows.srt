(BRAKES SCREECHING)

352
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:16,951
Uh, guys, they're coming back.

353
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:19,998
Enough! It's time to take out the trash.

354
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:25,874
(GRUNTING)

355
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:31,839
That's how I roll.

356
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:33,919
That's how you roll.

357
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Whoo!

358
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:37,880
(REVVING)

359
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:46,478
Anything else I can do for you?

360
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:47,680
(CHUCKLES)

361
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:53,315
Raider 3, move in. Move in.
Get him to the extraction point.

362
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:58,840
Oh...

363
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:05,276
We are two miles from Exit 14.
Set up an intercept.

364
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:11,148
- What is that thing?
- It's a big-ass magnet.

365
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:16,040
Whoa!

366
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:19,480
- (BOTH EXCLAIMING)
- Now we're talking!

367
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:22,560
(GRUNTS)

368
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,518
Get back there. Secure the prisoners.

369
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:37,200
(GRUNTS)

370
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:38,280
(LAUGHS)

371
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:39,520
(GROANS)

372
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:41,719
Shredder!

373
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:43,195
- (GRUNTS)
- (GROANS)

374
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:47,708
Shit!

375
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:49,711
- He's getting away!
- No, he's not.

376
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
(GRUNTING)

377
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:57,109
Yeah!

378
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:00,816
If Sensei Shredder
can't make it to the extraction point,

379
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:02,990
then we bring the extraction point to him.

380
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:04,816
- Come on, come on, come on.
- Don't rush me! Don't rush me!

381
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:05,840
BEBOP: (LAUGHS) Yeah!

382
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:10,114
Hey. My name is Be-bop!

383
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:12,549
Hi.

384
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:13,680
(SCREAMS)

385
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:21,077
Okay. It's all you, Mikey.

386
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:22,593
Time to shine.

387
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:24,440
Ow! Ow!

388
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:25,960
I'm sorry!

389
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:27,832
- It's stuck.
- Oh, this sucks.

390
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:31,119
- Oh, there it is.
- Whoo-hoo! Yeah!

391
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:33,517
This is awesome!

392
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:35,416
We have to teleport Shredder earlier.

393
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:36,555
KARAI: But you said...

394
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:39,234
Yes, that that would be
irresponsibly dangerous. True.

395
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:41,280
All right, Donnie,
you've got to get Mikey closer.

396
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:43,440
(SCREAMING)

397
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:46,520
(SCREAMING)

398
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:47,953
Locking on.

399
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:49,429
One shot is all you got.

400
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:54,200
Initiate.

401
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:55,793
Take the shot, Mikey!

402
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:56,880
(GRUNTS)

403
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:10,593
Where'd he go?

404
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:13,039
It worked!

405
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:15,789
But... Shredder's location unknown?

406
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:22,240
(GROANING)

407
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:28,835
Where am I?

408
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:31,992
Does it matter?

409
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:34,275
I know what you're thinking right now.

410
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:37,352
Of all the ways you'd like to kill me.

411
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:40,193
But that would require
you outthinking me.

412
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:44,353
And no one, no thing
is smarter than the Krang!

413
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:46,959
Oh, I'm sorry.

414
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:51,033
Did I get a little tentacle mucus
in your eyes, Shredder?

415
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:56,080
So you know my name.

416
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:58,071
Why am I here?

417
00:23:58,160 --> 00:24:00,435
Because you
and your buddy Dr. Stockman

418
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:02,909
found something of mine.

419
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,036
The teleportation device.

420
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:08,391
The teleport was
supposed to break me out of prison.

421
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:11,958
(LAUGHS) But it is capable
of so much more.

422
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:13,871
That device is part of a machine

423
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:15,837
called the arc capacitor.

424
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:20,791
Years ago, I launched
the arc capacitor to Earth's dimension.

425
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:23,110
But upon entering your atmosphere,

426
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:25,509
it broke apart into three pieces.

427
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:28,550
You and Stockman have one piece.

428
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:31,275
Another is in a museum in New York.

429
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:34,238
The third is in the Brazilian rainforest.

430
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:36,392
Collect the other two pieces.

431
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:38,391
Dr. Stockman should
be inventive enough

432
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:42,075
to reassemble the arc capacitor.

433
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:43,559
SHREDDER: And then what?

434
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:44,959
KRANG: It will open a portal

435
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:47,031
through which
I can bring my war machine,

436
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:49,918
the Technodrome, to Earth.

437
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:55,350
Together, we can bring
the people of your planet to their knees.

438
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:57,439
I'm interested.

439
00:24:57,800 --> 00:25:00,360
I will help you take down planet Earth

440
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:02,954
if you help me with my problem.

441
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:06,957
Four brothers will try to stop me.

442
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:09,559
Turtles.

443
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:11,676
I'm aware of your past.

444
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:13,632
Take this.

445
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:17,872
It will solve
all your problems with those pests.

446
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:22,115
I'll see you on the other side.

447
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:24,360
(GRUNTING)

448
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:28,157
Push me back in! (GRUNTING)

449
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:30,996
Push me in, you stupid robot.

450
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:32,120
(GRUNTS)

451
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:34,119
More!

452
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:37,199
You idiot!

453
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:38,616
APRIL: Okay, so he just vanished?

454
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:39,760
DONATELLO: Wait, wait, wait.

455
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:41,440
If I run the video
from my shoulder camera

456
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:42,616
through an electrostatic filter,

457
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:45,313
we might be able to see
what happened to Shredder.

458
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:47,197
Come on. Show me something, buddy.

459
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:48,633
Look! Right there!

460
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:56,276
It appears to be some kind of
residue from a teleportation event.

461
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:59,876
Yeah, teleportation event residue, man.
It's the worst.

462
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:02,155
Does that kind of technology even exist?

463
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:04,800
Baxter Stockman's been
working on this kind of tech for years.

464
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:06,576
All of that stuff
that I pulled off of his iPad,

465
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:08,816
it was full of information
about Shredder and the Foot Clan.

466
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:10,080
It was like a virtual playbook!

467
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:13,995
Baxter has to have a backup.
And I bet it's on the mainframe at TCRI.

468
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:16,919
Donnie, I need something.
What do you got?

469
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,194
Wait.

470
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:20,080
I know exactly what you need.

471
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:23,148
Totally plug-and-play.

472
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:25,436
Perfect. I'll go check it out.

473
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:27,357
We'll go with. Operate in support.

474
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:29,199
Wait.

475
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,433
The sun's coming up.

476
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:34,593
You can't go outside. You'll be seen.

477
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:41,336
MALE REPORTER 1: <i>The notorious
criminal known as Shredder</i>

478
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:42,800
<i>escaped police custody last night...</i>

479
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:44,376
FEMALE REPORTER: <i>He was being
transported from Lower Manhattan</i>

480
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:45,816
<i>where he was serving a life sentence...</i>

481
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:47,536
MALE REPORTER 2: <i>There's a
statewide manhunt in progress,</i>

482
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:48,616
<i>with the police chief saying</i>

483
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:50,756
<i>he will stop at nothing
to capture the fugitive.</i>

484
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,000
HAMLETT: Unbelievable.

485
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:57,273
Widen the search radius to 200 miles
on all bridges and ports.

486
00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:01,069
And I want hourly updates from
Homeland Security and Border Patrol.

487
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:03,037
Make it on the half hour.

488
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:05,315
Excuse me?

489
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:07,038
This is my investigation now.

490
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:09,156
Bureau Chief Vincent. Organized Crime.

491
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:10,798
I have jurisdictional authority.

492
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:12,518
You forfeited jurisdiction.

493
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:14,320
And you proved
to be an authority on nothing

494
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:17,830
when you lost
three convicted felons in one night!

495
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:20,593
Shredder's the most notorious criminal
this city has ever seen.

496
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:22,033
And we had him!

497
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:24,151
Now he's out there.

498
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:27,710
And where did you recover
this highly secured vehicle?

499
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:31,909
Found it under the G.W. Bridge,
abandoned and stripped.

500
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:34,349
Any witnesses?

501
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:37,152
Unfortunately.

502
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:38,936
CASEY: Everything's normal,
I'm following procedure,

503
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:42,999
and the next thing I know,
ninjas on motorcycles just...

504
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:44,514
They come zipping past!

505
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:47,313
And they're coming at us
from every possible direction.

506
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:49,119
- Keep going.
- Okay. Uh...

507
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:50,795
I look at my side view

508
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:53,030
and I see what has to be
a giant garbage truck

509
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:56,237
that is just barreling towards
us like it is on a warpath.

510
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:57,736
(STAMMERS) And what was
the objective of this

511
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:59,398
battle-hungry sanitation vehicle?

512
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:00,816
See, I'm wondering
the same thing myself.

513
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:03,229
But then it starts
launching manhole covers

514
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:05,356
right from the grille of the truck.

515
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:07,909
Manhole covers!

516
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:10,793
Yeah, manhole covers.
As guided projectiles.

517
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:12,114
(SIGHING)

518
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:13,838
You're taking some time off, Jones.

519
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:15,598
I'm pulling you off the payroll.

520
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:17,671
Hey, I'm not crazy! I know what I saw!

521
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:19,320
Look, I can help you catch these guys.

522
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:21,920
I'm from New York.
I know these streets better than anyone.

523
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,877
First rule of tracking fugitives:

524
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:25,016
Don't take help from someone

525
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:26,696
who's responsible
for losing them in the first place.

526
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:28,233
We were ambushed!

527
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:30,559
Thanks for your statement, Jones.

528
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:31,789

Leo, Leo, okay.
You're not gonna believe this.

888
00:48:12,120 --> 00:48:14,429
Okay, I made a solution
from a sample of the purple ooze,

889
00:48:14,520 --> 00:48:16,556
right, to expedite analysis of the isotope?

890
00:48:16,640 --> 00:48:19,791
But while I was waiting for it
to catalyze, I started thinking,

891
00:48:19,880 --> 00:48:23,077
if the purple ooze can
turn humans into animals,

892
00:48:23,320 --> 00:48:26,073
perhaps if properly reengineered...

894
00:48:29,480 --> 00:48:31,152

our hands on more of this stuff,

To blend in with humans

901
00:49:03,400 --> 00:49:06,039

our strategic advantage.
