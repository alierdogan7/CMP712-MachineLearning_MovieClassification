1
00:03:27,734 --> 00:03:28,723
Guard one check.

2
00:03:29,435 --> 00:03:31,426
This is a standard exercise
for the military.

3
00:03:31,738 --> 00:03:34,206
lt's main purpose is to test
the integrity of our system.

4
00:03:34,874 --> 00:03:35,738
Sharon

5
00:03:36,242 --> 00:03:38,472
Operation bug chase commencing
in thirty seconds.

6
00:03:39,312 --> 00:03:40,609
This is an exercise.

7
00:03:40,813 --> 00:03:43,247
l repeat. This is an exercise.

8
00:03:46,052 --> 00:03:47,485
Beetle Alpha, you have a go.

9
00:03:48,321 --> 00:03:49,413
Beetle check.

10
00:03:51,224 --> 00:03:53,283
Beetle Alpha represents
the planes of an imaginary enemy.

11
00:03:53,426 --> 00:03:56,293
They will try to avoid
our radar by flying low.

12
00:03:56,763 --> 00:04:00,426
lf they lock on to
our target with their aiming system,

13
00:04:00,566 --> 00:04:01,658
we lose.

14
00:04:01,801 --> 00:04:02,699
Anything on screen?

15
00:04:02,869 --> 00:04:05,064
We don't have anything,
Sir, they are below one thousand.

16
00:04:13,346 --> 00:04:20,843
Receiving Awac's data, Beetle identified
Designated BD001-002, 2 minute's ETA.

17
00:04:21,587 --> 00:04:24,283
Target on screen,
request firing AlM-120.

18
00:04:25,491 --> 00:04:27,618
Request denied!
Visual identification required.

19
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:28,590
Affirmative.

20
00:04:35,168 --> 00:04:36,658
Defense radar swipe 1 second.

21
00:04:36,869 --> 00:04:37,767
Yes sir!

22
00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:45,041
Beetle jumping up to one thousand.

23
00:04:45,178 --> 00:04:46,338
They are starting bomb run.

24
00:04:46,546 --> 00:04:47,444
Start ECM.

25
00:04:58,491 --> 00:05:01,051
Two targets locked.
Request firing two AA missiles.

26
00:05:01,194 --> 00:05:03,162
A-4 logged on. Fire! Fire!

27
00:05:05,565 --> 00:05:06,759
Beetle, you are dead!

28
00:05:06,899 --> 00:05:07,957
Guard returning to base.

29
00:05:10,603 --> 00:05:11,695
Well done everybody.

30
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,933
Deactivate all missiles defense system,

31
00:05:16,209 --> 00:05:17,005
Return to normal.

32
00:05:17,143 --> 00:05:19,270
Sir, our system is clean!

33
00:05:19,412 --> 00:05:20,401
Thank you, Colonel!

34
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:24,006
So you mean the Singapore government
is prepared for war?

35
00:05:24,183 --> 00:05:26,174
Traditional warfare, yes.

36
00:05:26,386 --> 00:05:28,149
But another kind of warfare
has developed.

37
00:05:28,454 --> 00:05:30,081
So we have to upgrade our defenses.

38
00:05:30,623 --> 00:05:31,988
Another kind of warfare?

39
00:05:32,959 --> 00:05:36,486
Computer warfare, lt is happening
everyday via the lnternet.

40
00:05:36,629 --> 00:05:38,620
Nobody has ever
declared a full-scale war.

41
00:05:38,765 --> 00:05:40,824
But casualties are already very high.

42
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:44,558
We believe if any country
wants to raise a full-scale war,

43
00:05:44,704 --> 00:05:47,172
the first shot won't be
bullets or missiles.

44
00:05:47,306 --> 00:05:48,705
lt will be computer bombs.

45
00:05:50,009 --> 00:05:53,911
Colonel Ng has just been placed in
charge of our lnformation Warfare Unit.

46
00:05:54,514 --> 00:05:57,005
Why 'information', not just 'computers'?

47
00:05:57,650 --> 00:05:59,811
lt is less scary for everyone sir.

48
00:05:59,952 --> 00:06:03,012
You see,
today any laptop computer now can do

49
00:06:03,156 --> 00:06:04,282
a lot more damage than an atomic bomb.

50
00:06:04,424 --> 00:06:06,392
We just hate to remind people.

51
00:06:17,904 --> 00:06:20,031
The ultimate weapon of tomorrow.

52
00:06:20,173 --> 00:06:21,140
This is the sleeper?

53
00:06:21,274 --> 00:06:24,573
l already place this innocent
little sucker into the system l serviced.

54
00:06:25,344 --> 00:06:28,040
When they check the system for viruses,
nothing.

55
00:06:28,848 --> 00:06:31,612
But when we use the Caller Program
to wake this little sucker up,

56
00:06:31,784 --> 00:06:34,116
Bingo! The service is ours.

57
00:06:34,787 --> 00:06:36,846
First National Bank at your service, sir.

58
00:06:37,990 --> 00:06:38,820
Did you test it?

59
00:06:38,991 --> 00:06:41,755
What do you mean did l test it?
You gave me a half-finished program!

60
00:06:41,894 --> 00:06:43,555
You told me you'd give me a finished one.

61
00:06:43,696 --> 00:06:44,924
l can't.

62
00:06:45,064 --> 00:06:46,429
The company found out.

63
00:06:46,899 --> 00:06:48,799
Their CEO just called me yesterday,
said...

64
00:06:48,935 --> 00:06:50,698
... someone had stolen
their sleeper design

65
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:52,030
and their caller program.

66
00:06:52,738 --> 00:06:54,399
They'll probably report it to ClA.

67
00:06:54,607 --> 00:06:57,838
But you are the ClA!
You are the head of their security.

68
00:06:58,678 --> 00:07:01,044
l know! That's why
they're reporting to me.

69
00:07:02,181 --> 00:07:05,480
Anyway they'll here in Singapore
in 3 minutes on this plane.

70
00:07:05,751 --> 00:07:07,514
So what am l supposed to do? Stop it now?

71
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:09,620
No, not that we got this far.

72
00:07:10,790 --> 00:07:12,451
Can you finish
the caller program yourself?

73
00:07:13,526 --> 00:07:15,619
No! l need some time.

74
00:07:15,761 --> 00:07:18,821
l'll need at least a month
on this one, big boy.

75
00:07:21,067 --> 00:07:21,897
l'll buy you some time.

76
00:07:22,034 --> 00:07:23,695
Oh? How do you plan on doing that? Huh?

77
00:07:28,374 --> 00:07:29,534
Yes?

78
00:07:31,711 --> 00:07:32,575
Shoot it down!

79
00:08:47,954 --> 00:08:48,978
Trying to escape?

80
00:08:58,464 --> 00:08:59,192
Shit!

81
00:09:01,167 --> 00:09:03,533
Have you ever been shot
by a Vulcan before?

82
00:09:04,503 --> 00:09:05,663
Let's have another game, okay?

83
00:09:06,005 --> 00:09:08,371
We haven't done any work yet today.

84
00:09:09,475 --> 00:09:11,773
Every game has its weak point.

85
00:09:12,178 --> 00:09:15,272
Otherwise how could l win at FF8
in under 8 hours?

86
00:09:16,315 --> 00:09:19,409
You're crazy!
Why didn't you upgrade the RPG?

87
00:09:19,719 --> 00:09:21,516
Just 8 hours!

88
00:09:21,721 --> 00:09:24,087
Can you beat it in eight hours?

89
00:09:24,290 --> 00:09:28,727
The Command and Conquer ll you ordered
has arrived. Do you want it now?

90
00:09:28,861 --> 00:09:30,192
- Sure. Thank you.
- l'll go get it.

91
00:09:30,663 --> 00:09:32,631
What the hell? Didn't you buy it already?

92
00:09:33,099 --> 00:09:35,033
Never mind, l'll give it to you.

93
00:09:35,334 --> 00:09:36,995
l've already bought it, too.

94
00:09:37,169 --> 00:09:38,830
Why do l need another one?

95
00:09:39,972 --> 00:09:41,132
You really don't understand?

96
00:09:42,975 --> 00:09:44,033
Of course l don't.

97
00:09:45,011 --> 00:09:47,172
Thank you, if we get some new stock,
l'll call you.

98
00:09:47,313 --> 00:09:48,974
- Thanks!
- Goodbye...

99
00:09:50,316 --> 00:09:51,476
Thank you.

100
00:09:53,486 --> 00:09:55,818
There new games
aren't any challenge for me.

101
00:09:56,589 --> 00:09:58,682
lsn't our business challenging enough?

102
00:09:58,891 --> 00:10:00,950
The company hasn't made any profit yet,
you know?

103
00:10:01,293 --> 00:10:03,523
We will by next month.

104
00:10:04,163 --> 00:10:08,099
l told the boss of the United Company
that he has a virus in his computers.

105
00:10:08,234 --> 00:10:10,566
And to renew all his 3-D video cards.

106
00:10:12,638 --> 00:10:15,129
What's the relationship
between a virus and 3-D video cards?

107
00:10:15,608 --> 00:10:18,543
No direct relationship,
but we have plenty of stock, that's all.

108
00:10:19,078 --> 00:10:20,773
Remember what you promised Jennifer?

109
00:10:20,946 --> 00:10:22,345
Buy some more stock, okay?

110
00:10:22,481 --> 00:10:24,472
Sure, sure...

111
00:10:24,684 --> 00:10:26,276
You still think l was wrong?

112
00:10:26,752 --> 00:10:29,812
Forget it. That fat bastard is rich.

113
00:10:30,022 --> 00:10:32,991
He can use that computer
to check stock prices.

114
00:10:33,159 --> 00:10:36,322
He'll find it looks so sharp and clear.

115
00:10:36,462 --> 00:10:39,488
13,000 points will leap out
from the screen at him!

116
00:10:41,567 --> 00:10:42,397
Fai?

117
00:10:43,335 --> 00:10:45,030
'Cool Guy' Fai!

118
00:10:46,872 --> 00:10:48,965
Stop! Why are you running away?

119
00:10:49,742 --> 00:10:51,266
- Do you have any stock?
- What stock?

120
00:10:52,578 --> 00:10:53,977
Keep it down or you'll get me in trouble!

121
00:10:57,316 --> 00:10:59,910
What 'shit'?
This is for the love of my life.

122
00:11:01,153 --> 00:11:02,211
Do you have any stock?

123
00:11:02,722 --> 00:11:04,713
Next time! You're the next on my list...

124
00:11:05,224 --> 00:11:07,624
You think l'm an idiot?
That list is endless!

125
00:11:08,494 --> 00:11:11,793
Save your breath. l'll pay
ten thousand more than any price offered.

126
00:11:16,001 --> 00:11:17,127
For real?

127
00:11:17,503 --> 00:11:18,561
You got one now?

128
00:11:18,704 --> 00:11:20,501
Cash on delivery.

129
00:11:20,639 --> 00:11:22,607
Wait here!

130
00:11:23,175 --> 00:11:25,575
You promised to give it to me!

131
00:11:25,711 --> 00:11:28,646
- How can you sell it to him?
- Ten thousand!

132
00:11:28,981 --> 00:11:30,312
You're a sucker when it comes to women.

133
00:11:30,449 --> 00:11:31,780
Can't you show some class?

134
00:11:32,351 --> 00:11:34,785
Come on! l didn't do anything.

135
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:37,150
That's my point exactly!

136
00:11:37,857 --> 00:11:40,052
l've never seen you
seriously chase a girl.

137
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:42,660
Tell me, which one do you like?

138
00:11:42,895 --> 00:11:43,953
l'll hook you up.

139
00:11:44,463 --> 00:11:45,521
You really don't understand me.

140
00:11:45,664 --> 00:11:47,996
Each girl has her own special charm.

141
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:49,292
You're one sick dude!

142
00:11:49,468 --> 00:11:52,835
Don't give me that 'true romance' crap!

143
00:11:53,038 --> 00:11:55,268
- l'm not impressed.
- So l'm a romantic...

144
00:11:55,407 --> 00:11:56,601
For Christ's sake!

145
00:11:56,942 --> 00:11:58,068
Here comes your Juliet, Romeo!

146
00:11:59,345 --> 00:12:00,141
Hi! Why so early?

147
00:12:00,446 --> 00:12:01,310
You said you'd come at this time.

148
00:12:01,447 --> 00:12:02,846
So l brought you this.

149
00:12:05,017 --> 00:12:06,644
Are you going to cook?

150
00:12:06,886 --> 00:12:09,446
No, l just prepared some hot pot.

151
00:12:12,725 --> 00:12:13,885
What's that?

152
00:12:15,094 --> 00:12:17,187
This is your dream toy!

153
00:12:18,898 --> 00:12:21,264
A robot dog?

154
00:12:22,568 --> 00:12:24,195
lt's so cute! Where did you buy it?

155
00:12:24,336 --> 00:12:25,735
lsn't it? See?

156
00:12:26,305 --> 00:12:27,795
More money from your honey.

157
00:12:28,407 --> 00:12:30,898
- How much was it?
- Sixty thousand dollars.

158
00:12:31,744 --> 00:12:34,474
Hey, you haven't cleared
your credit card bill yet!

159
00:12:36,315 --> 00:12:38,545
Don't spoil the mood, okay?

160
00:13:15,721 --> 00:13:18,121
- Don't move!
- Greg!

161
00:13:18,524 --> 00:13:20,014
What are you two playing at?

162
00:13:22,895 --> 00:13:24,760
Try putting this cream on it.

163
00:13:25,130 --> 00:13:26,461
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

164
00:13:26,799 --> 00:13:28,198
l'll be in to the kitchen.

165
00:13:30,135 --> 00:13:31,159
Who is she?

166
00:13:31,637 --> 00:13:33,298
Janet, my little sister.

167
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:36,337
She wasn't that pretty before.

168
00:13:37,209 --> 00:13:39,803
l suspect she had
plastic surgery in Canada...

169
00:13:42,481 --> 00:13:44,915
- Happy now, eh?
- Right!

170
00:13:47,253 --> 00:13:48,311
What a waste of money.

171
00:13:50,356 --> 00:13:51,755
You shouldn't say
such things about your sister.

172
00:13:51,891 --> 00:13:53,119
My sister isn't the problem.

173
00:13:53,259 --> 00:13:56,524
Even a rich guy shouldn't
waste his money on women.

174
00:13:58,664 --> 00:13:59,858
So, are you broke now?

175
00:14:00,833 --> 00:14:02,130
That has nothing to do with her.

176
00:14:02,935 --> 00:14:04,425
l admit that l'm a big spender.

177
00:14:05,137 --> 00:14:06,695
But, don't blame Janet for that.

178
00:14:07,139 --> 00:14:08,538
l can tell.

179
00:14:09,375 --> 00:14:10,842
Look at that new TV set!

180
00:14:12,678 --> 00:14:15,511
And the sound system.
You know how much it cost?

181
00:14:15,915 --> 00:14:17,143
You bastard!

182
00:14:18,384 --> 00:14:19,749
You were so happy at the time!

183
00:14:19,885 --> 00:14:22,149
Of course! You gave me the old one...

184
00:14:30,262 --> 00:14:31,661
Take it.

185
00:14:35,067 --> 00:14:36,295
Thank you.

186
00:14:37,002 --> 00:14:37,969
l'm really touched.

187
00:14:38,270 --> 00:14:40,238
l'll smack you in the mouth
if you try and kiss me again!

188
00:14:40,372 --> 00:14:41,669
Let me put some cream on for you.

189
00:14:48,013 --> 00:14:50,345
Have the vegetables drowned yet?

190
00:14:50,482 --> 00:14:51,710
What?

191
00:14:51,917 --> 00:14:54,886
You've been washing them for hours!

192
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:57,318
l'm not used to doing this kind of work.

193
00:14:58,023 --> 00:15:02,187
Well, you did a good job anyway.

194
00:15:02,328 --> 00:15:03,818
Not a worm to be found.

195
00:15:05,764 --> 00:15:07,527
- Let me tell you something...
- What is it?

196
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:10,191
No more worries.

197
00:15:10,703 --> 00:15:11,931
Why?

198
00:15:14,173 --> 00:15:17,939
My brother gave me money.

199
00:15:18,210 --> 00:15:20,075
What exactly does Greg do in the USA?

200
00:15:20,446 --> 00:15:22,539
He kills bugs, computer bugs.

201
00:15:23,182 --> 00:15:24,706
Can you make a lot of money from that?

202
00:15:25,084 --> 00:15:28,110
l don't know,
but my company is still running

203
00:15:28,253 --> 00:15:29,982
even though it's lost money for years.

204
00:15:35,394 --> 00:15:36,588
- Hey!
- What's the matter?

205
00:15:36,729 --> 00:15:38,629
You haven't touched
this savings box for ages.

206
00:15:38,764 --> 00:15:39,992
l put all the money into it.

207
00:15:40,132 --> 00:15:42,623
- Give me some coins.
- You've already got some.

208
00:15:42,768 --> 00:15:44,326
These are mine, how about yours?

209
00:15:46,572 --> 00:15:49,006
lt's useless to save money like this!
Come on, l'll give it all to you.

210
00:15:49,141 --> 00:15:50,904
lt's better than saving nothing at all.

211
00:15:51,877 --> 00:15:54,437
Maybe you'll need this
to last the rest of your life.

212
00:15:55,914 --> 00:15:57,779
You can't just count on me.

213
00:15:58,917 --> 00:16:01,545
l'm getting together
with some friends tonight.

214
00:16:01,687 --> 00:16:02,949
Why don't you two come along?

215
00:16:04,089 --> 00:16:05,215
Tonight?

216
00:16:05,491 --> 00:16:07,584
What? Scared she might scold you?

217
00:16:08,927 --> 00:16:10,326
No, she wouldn't do that.

218
00:16:10,496 --> 00:16:11,520
That's settled, then.

219
00:16:13,766 --> 00:16:15,165
Ask her to come too.

220
00:16:17,236 --> 00:16:18,260
She can come along?

221
00:16:18,404 --> 00:16:21,339
What kind of place
do you think we're going to?

222
00:16:22,141 --> 00:16:24,507
No, l mean, l don't know...

223
00:16:29,915 --> 00:16:31,644
Major, Colonel wants to see you

224
00:16:33,185 --> 00:16:34,948
You go through the whole list again,
anything that...

225
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:38,419
Yeah, yeah, yeah... anything
that says install, you just circle, OK?

226
00:16:38,690 --> 00:16:41,352
l don't know who did this.
All this is wrong, this is wrong.

227
00:16:48,734 --> 00:16:49,792
Sorry!

228
00:16:51,070 --> 00:16:54,039
At ease, Major. So, you want some coffee?

229
00:16:54,673 --> 00:16:56,004
No sir, thank you sir.

230
00:16:56,141 --> 00:16:59,201
So... you are going to be here
working with us for a while.

231
00:17:00,279 --> 00:17:03,715
- l'm transferred, sir?
- Welcome to lnformation Warfare Unit.

232
00:17:04,783 --> 00:17:05,681
Sorry!

233
00:17:06,118 --> 00:17:08,348
Basically here we deal with
computer warfare.

234
00:17:08,487 --> 00:17:10,079
This is Sharon, my assistant.

235
00:17:10,989 --> 00:17:13,583
Sir, l'm not very good at computers.

236
00:17:13,759 --> 00:17:15,021
l know, l know, don't worry.

237
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:16,889
But you are very good
at catching spies, right?

238
00:17:19,698 --> 00:17:21,461
Sharon, l think, you carry on.

239
00:17:23,068 --> 00:17:24,626
We have launched
a preliminary investigation

240
00:17:24,770 --> 00:17:25,964
into last week's mid-air explosion.

241
00:17:26,105 --> 00:17:27,538
The air force claim that
it was not an accident.

242
00:17:28,941 --> 00:17:30,602
You mean the private plane?

243
00:17:32,244 --> 00:17:35,111
lt belongs to a
well-established company called TDX.

244
00:17:35,314 --> 00:17:36,975
TDX is involved
in several major projects.

245
00:17:37,316 --> 00:17:39,580
With their most famous being
a computer protection system.

246
00:17:40,285 --> 00:17:41,252
Among the passengers killed,

247
00:17:41,386 --> 00:17:44,253
was their president
and a department head.

248
00:17:45,557 --> 00:17:46,717
Who would want to kill them?

249
00:17:47,192 --> 00:17:49,752
The US government suspects
that this is a spy scandal.

250
00:17:49,895 --> 00:17:51,954
Someone stole something from the TDX.

251
00:17:52,097 --> 00:17:55,123
lt's a program designed for the US Army.

252
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:56,665
They are investigating the matter.

253
00:17:58,570 --> 00:18:00,435
Who did it?

254
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:02,529
They are not sure.

255
00:18:02,808 --> 00:18:05,242
But they do have a suspect : Greg Li.

256
00:18:05,911 --> 00:18:07,378
He's gone to Hong Kong.

257
00:18:07,513 --> 00:18:10,277
The US government said
they plan to bring him back.

258
00:18:13,285 --> 00:18:14,217
So, what do you want me to do?

259
00:18:14,353 --> 00:18:16,719
Ah, well, we also need
to conduct our own investigation.

260
00:18:16,855 --> 00:18:18,550
But we don't want anyone else
to know about it, OK?

261
00:18:19,124 --> 00:18:21,820
We believe the stolen program
is an attack program.

262
00:18:22,261 --> 00:18:23,250
So you want me to get it back?

263
00:18:23,428 --> 00:18:24,759
No, no, no, no, no.

264
00:18:24,897 --> 00:18:26,956
We just want to investigate, that's all!

265
00:18:27,099 --> 00:18:28,498
We just want to know more.

266
00:18:28,634 --> 00:18:30,864
We don't want Singapore
involved in a spy war, OK?

267
00:18:31,436 --> 00:18:33,336
But sir, this is a spy war.

268
00:18:33,472 --> 00:18:35,599
Yeah, well you consider yourself
a war zone reporter, then.

269
00:18:35,741 --> 00:18:38,107
You report but you don't get involved,
understand?

270
00:18:39,244 --> 00:18:40,871
l think that's going to be tough, sir.

271
00:18:42,347 --> 00:18:44,315
Well that's why you're here, isn't it?

272
00:18:44,483 --> 00:18:46,041
Ah? You're the best, right?

273
00:18:47,286 --> 00:18:49,777
l'll download the necessary information
into your computer.

274
00:18:50,022 --> 00:18:51,148
You have to fly tonight.

275
00:18:51,290 --> 00:18:52,257
Tonight?

276
00:18:52,658 --> 00:18:53,556
Yes!

277
00:18:55,194 --> 00:18:56,752
lsn't today your birthday?

278
00:18:57,996 --> 00:18:59,327
That has nothing to do with you.

279
00:18:59,498 --> 00:19:01,056
l already have a date.

280
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:03,464
Hey! You two know each other?

281
00:19:03,936 --> 00:19:05,096
No sir.

282
00:19:06,705 --> 00:19:07,763
OK, major, you can go.

283
00:19:07,906 --> 00:19:08,736
Yes, sir!

284
00:19:11,610 --> 00:19:12,872
Hey! Happy birthday!

285
00:19:13,212 --> 00:19:14,577
Thank you sir, you overheard. Thank you.

286
00:19:15,814 --> 00:19:17,281
Just don't forget me now
you're a high-roller!

287
00:19:17,416 --> 00:19:19,077
No more bullshit please!

288
00:19:19,985 --> 00:19:23,250
But seriously,
remember to take care of my brother.

289
00:19:23,622 --> 00:19:25,852
Don't worry,
l'll do all l can to help him.

290
00:19:26,258 --> 00:19:28,488
Peter, l'll ask my secretary to call you.

291
00:19:28,627 --> 00:19:29,753
Great!

292
00:19:34,833 --> 00:19:36,494
Greg, has your girlfriend come with you?

293
00:19:36,735 --> 00:19:37,793
She's still in LA.

294
00:19:37,970 --> 00:19:39,460
So my plan will work out after all.

295
00:19:40,205 --> 00:19:41,229
Look.

296
00:19:42,641 --> 00:19:44,734
- Johnson, Greg
- Alfred

297
00:19:44,876 --> 00:19:46,241
Hi, Greg, we haven't seen you for ages.

298
00:19:46,378 --> 00:19:48,369
- Nice to meet you, how are you?
- l'm fine.

299
00:19:50,582 --> 00:19:54,575
Greg, you must have forgotten me already!

300
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:55,448
Let me introduce,

301
00:19:55,587 --> 00:19:57,919
The greatest beauty
of the finance world, Hera Lam.

302
00:19:58,323 --> 00:19:59,881
Greg Li...

303
00:20:00,025 --> 00:20:02,152
Johnson told me you are
the vice president of the TDX.

304
00:20:02,294 --> 00:20:03,352
Come on, take a seat.

305
00:20:06,431 --> 00:20:08,058
You look like a pervert!

306
00:20:11,103 --> 00:20:12,161
May l have your name card?

307
00:20:12,304 --> 00:20:13,464
Sorry!

308
00:20:16,174 --> 00:20:18,699
- May l call you?
- Up to you.

309
00:20:23,782 --> 00:20:25,044
Let's have a drink!

310
00:20:26,585 --> 00:20:27,813
All the best...

311
00:20:37,963 --> 00:20:39,897
Time to go.

312
00:20:40,632 --> 00:20:42,930
Manchester United are playing tonight.
We have to go.

313
00:20:43,835 --> 00:20:45,063
But you can watch the match right here.

314
00:20:45,937 --> 00:20:47,495
Kids like to watch TV at home.

315
00:20:47,639 --> 00:20:50,472
But your brother has grown up already!

316
00:20:50,609 --> 00:20:52,133
You're lucky to have
such a caring brother.

317
00:20:52,277 --> 00:20:53,676
You'll soon make something of yourself.

318
00:20:53,812 --> 00:20:55,837
Let me tell you something :

319
00:20:56,014 --> 00:20:57,982
To be the woman of a successful man,

320
00:20:58,183 --> 00:21:00,447
you still have a lot to learn...

321
00:21:00,819 --> 00:21:01,786
Yes...

322
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:04,115
Set a good example for the kids, please.

323
00:21:04,289 --> 00:21:05,381
Let's go...

324
00:21:07,426 --> 00:21:09,189
- See you!
- You Really have to go?

325
00:21:09,394 --> 00:21:11,385
Wise up! Let's have fun some other time.

326
00:21:11,697 --> 00:21:12,857
Bye...

327
00:21:13,031 --> 00:21:14,259
Call me, Peter.

328
00:21:14,499 --> 00:21:15,727
Bye...

329
00:21:18,970 --> 00:21:21,234
- Greg, are you leaving already?
- You came so late!

330
00:21:21,373 --> 00:21:22,772
lt's still early!

331
00:21:22,908 --> 00:21:24,273
We've got to go now,
time for us to leave.

332
00:21:24,409 --> 00:21:25,899
Well, let's have fun next time, bye.

333
00:21:33,485 --> 00:21:35,350
Those guys are jerks.

334
00:21:35,554 --> 00:21:37,545
But you can still do business with them.

335
00:21:37,756 --> 00:21:39,087
Just don't get too close.

336
00:21:41,226 --> 00:21:43,820
Sure, l won't make friends
with those guys.

337
00:21:46,064 --> 00:21:47,190
You know?

338
00:21:54,539 --> 00:21:56,598
The latest development
in the Singapore plane crash...

339
00:21:56,742 --> 00:21:58,403
is that the aviation department
has declared the crash

340
00:21:58,610 --> 00:22:00,168
was caused intentionally.

341
00:22:00,479 --> 00:22:06,384
The US government believes it may be
connected to a computer spy ring.

342
00:22:06,518 --> 00:22:07,985
The investigation is continuing.

343
00:22:08,186 --> 00:22:09,710
The following is Hong Kong's news...

344
00:22:10,255 --> 00:22:13,156
Look! The boss is coming out,
left... left...

345
00:22:13,291 --> 00:22:14,815
lf you're not playing, put down the gun.

346
00:22:16,962 --> 00:22:19,021
Greg, are you all right?

347
00:22:19,164 --> 00:22:20,563
Salina, what happened?

348
00:22:20,732 --> 00:22:23,428
l don't know, but there were
a lot of FBl men here earlier.

349
00:22:23,568 --> 00:22:24,899
What have you done?

350
00:22:25,237 --> 00:22:26,397
Why didn't you call me?

351
00:22:27,606 --> 00:22:30,837
l didn't dare!
l planned to call you from home.

352
00:22:39,785 --> 00:22:42,185
Greg, is everything okay?

353
00:22:43,388 --> 00:22:45,856
lt's okay, l'll be fine.

354
00:22:46,191 --> 00:22:48,284
l'll call you later, l love you.

355
00:22:49,361 --> 00:22:50,350
l love you.

356
00:22:55,367 --> 00:22:56,493
The program is being downloaded.

357
00:22:59,404 --> 00:23:01,599
Confidential. Do you want
to download all E-mail messages?

358
00:23:09,014 --> 00:23:11,380
lt's hard work! Let's try another game.

359
00:23:16,855 --> 00:23:22,054
- Are you all right?
- l'm fine.

360
00:23:22,861 --> 00:23:24,829
Benny, l want to make more copies.

361
00:23:24,963 --> 00:23:25,793
Please give me a hand.

362
00:23:25,931 --> 00:23:27,228
Okay, no problem.

363
00:23:38,310 --> 00:23:39,504
Asleep already...

364
00:23:45,817 --> 00:23:47,284
You got so chubby!

365
00:24:11,543 --> 00:24:14,171
Hurry up! l can't wait for you,
l have to get to school.

366
00:24:14,646 --> 00:24:17,342
All right, let me pack my things first.

367
00:24:26,691 --> 00:24:28,522
- Good morning.
- Good morning, going to school?

368
00:24:28,727 --> 00:24:30,490
- Yes, goodbye!
- Goodbye...

369
00:24:52,851 --> 00:24:53,818
Sir!

370
00:24:58,356 --> 00:25:00,790
No matter what happens,
you must remember one thing :

371
00:25:01,393 --> 00:25:02,985
Stay behind me.

372
00:25:04,062 --> 00:25:05,529
Thank you, Ronald.

373
00:26:00,685 --> 00:26:02,414
Down!

374
00:26:03,488 --> 00:26:05,115
- What are you doing here?
- Shut up! On the floor!

375
00:26:12,831 --> 00:26:14,799
Don't shoot, it's just an air gun!

376
00:26:17,902 --> 00:26:19,733
Air gun? You want to ruin my career?

377
00:26:19,938 --> 00:26:21,200
lf l shoot you dead,
how do l write the report?

378
00:26:23,675 --> 00:26:24,835
What crime are we meant
to have we committed?

379
00:26:25,443 --> 00:26:28,571
Mr. Greg Li, the US government
suspects that you are a spy.

380
00:26:28,747 --> 00:26:30,271
You are requested to help us
with our investigation.

381
00:26:30,715 --> 00:26:32,148
Please answer my question,

382
00:26:33,118 --> 00:26:36,019
Mr. Greg Li, are you a spy?

383
00:26:36,321 --> 00:26:37,652
Of course not.

384
00:26:38,289 --> 00:26:39,756
Mr. Woo, you heard that?

385
00:26:39,891 --> 00:26:41,722
He denies being a spy.

386
00:26:42,093 --> 00:26:44,960
What will be the
US government's next move?

387
00:26:46,998 --> 00:26:50,729
We'll request an extradition order
and access to all Greg Li's files.

388
00:26:51,169 --> 00:26:52,397
l want to see the US diplomat.

389
00:26:52,671 --> 00:26:54,195
- l want to see my lawyer.
- Okay...

390
00:26:54,639 --> 00:26:56,197
One by one please.

391
00:26:57,142 --> 00:26:59,235
You have rights, and you have duties.

392
00:26:59,444 --> 00:27:00,342
lf you want to look for clues,

393
00:27:00,478 --> 00:27:04,175
please ask your men to join my officers
in searching for evidence.

394
00:27:05,550 --> 00:27:07,040
Sir, there are a lot of discs.

395
00:27:07,185 --> 00:27:08,413
We found this among him.

396
00:27:08,787 --> 00:27:11,278
We'll put it into this envelope,
and seal it.

397
00:27:11,423 --> 00:27:12,981
Then we'll counter sign it.

398
00:27:13,124 --> 00:27:14,421
Let's examine it at the office.

399
00:27:14,959 --> 00:27:16,392
So you won't accuse us of playing tricks.

400
00:27:18,363 --> 00:27:20,388
That's fair enough, thank you!

401
00:27:20,732 --> 00:27:21,721
You're welcome!

402
00:27:25,937 --> 00:27:27,768
Don't worry, Mr. Li.

403
00:27:28,573 --> 00:27:31,736
Many people are suspected of
being spies by the US government,

404
00:27:34,179 --> 00:27:35,703
but they always make mistakes.

405
00:27:57,936 --> 00:27:58,994
What happened?

406
00:27:59,971 --> 00:28:01,370
What's up? Check the fuse.

407
00:28:02,907 --> 00:28:04,067
lt's okay.

408
00:28:04,876 --> 00:28:06,969
What's the matter? X-file?

409
00:28:22,927 --> 00:28:26,624
He doesn't seem like
he's involved with this case.

410
00:28:29,134 --> 00:28:30,726
Do you like this handsome guy?

411
00:28:35,774 --> 00:28:39,870
l know he may not be
involved in this case.

412
00:28:41,179 --> 00:28:43,204
But, that's none of our business.

413
00:28:44,682 --> 00:28:46,616
We can detain him for up to 48 hours.

414
00:28:46,785 --> 00:28:48,810
But we have no reason to release him now.

415
00:28:50,121 --> 00:28:53,181
We are here to arrest spies, not hawkers.

416
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:57,027
Should we inform
the National Security Council?

417
00:28:59,531 --> 00:29:01,362
They were already informed.

418
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:04,798
They said, since he denied being a spy,

419
00:29:04,936 --> 00:29:07,268
then, this has nothing to do
with national security.

420
00:29:07,405 --> 00:29:09,396
So they are not involved in this case.

421
00:29:10,141 --> 00:29:12,905
ln another words, we should
handle it ourselves, understand?

422
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:19,247
Officer Ng, the officers from
the US Embassy have come.

423
00:29:20,418 --> 00:29:21,043
OK!

424
00:29:37,402 --> 00:29:39,563
OK, you help yourself.

425
00:29:39,971 --> 00:29:42,166
Mr. Ng, we demand a private conversation.

426
00:29:42,307 --> 00:29:44,332
We expect you to make
the proper arrangements.

427
00:29:46,044 --> 00:29:51,380
Yes, Mr. Woo,
you are in Hong Kong, China.

428
00:29:51,549 --> 00:29:54,746
You got no demand, but you can request,

429
00:29:55,119 --> 00:29:59,920
Fill up some forms and then l will
make the arrangement whatever you like,

430
00:30:00,391 --> 00:30:01,517
but later.

431
00:30:02,861 --> 00:30:04,192
No problem.

432
00:30:04,395 --> 00:30:05,726
l'm satisfied.

433
00:30:06,831 --> 00:30:08,093
That's good.

434
00:30:08,633 --> 00:30:10,533
Take your time, call me if necessary.

435
00:30:10,668 --> 00:30:11,965
Thank you.

436
00:30:19,744 --> 00:30:22,577
- So good to see you sir.
- You asked for us?

437
00:30:22,747 --> 00:30:23,839
Yes.

438
00:30:26,251 --> 00:30:29,015
Don't worry, Mr. Woo and l
have no secrets between us.

439
00:30:33,725 --> 00:30:36,125
Didn't you check the goods
before you delivered them to your client?

440
00:30:36,361 --> 00:30:38,852
Actually l didn't know who my client was.

441
00:30:39,130 --> 00:30:40,290
Why?

442
00:30:40,899 --> 00:30:43,333
TDX isn't an ordinary company.

443
00:30:43,701 --> 00:30:44,633
What?

444
00:30:45,136 --> 00:30:46,728
My staff number is...

445
00:30:46,871 --> 00:30:53,003
NSD Rosetta's Unit TDX 781019880

446
00:30:54,312 --> 00:30:55,904
l don't understand.

447
00:30:56,347 --> 00:30:58,838
l think l understand, sir.
l can explain to you later.

448
00:30:59,317 --> 00:31:00,306
What proof do you have?

449
00:31:01,052 --> 00:31:02,314
l already reported to my boss.

450
00:31:02,453 --> 00:31:04,114
That someone invaded our system.

451
00:31:04,255 --> 00:31:07,224
l downloaded all the E-mail messages
and the program l wrote.

452
00:31:07,358 --> 00:31:08,723
You can check it!

453
00:31:12,730 --> 00:31:14,823
- Nothing is left.
- What?

454
00:31:15,967 --> 00:31:18,094
Your home was attacked
by an electric-ion bomb.

455
00:31:18,236 --> 00:31:20,568
All the information on the computer
has been erased.

456
00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:24,674
l don't think even the Hong Kong police
know what happened.

457
00:31:25,043 --> 00:31:26,340
But my colleagues and l have checked.

458
00:31:26,678 --> 00:31:29,943
lt was the equivalent of 100 X-rays.

459
00:31:30,348 --> 00:31:32,543
Theoretically, everyone at the scene...

460
00:31:33,151 --> 00:31:34,812
now has a very high chance
of getting cancer.

461
00:31:36,721 --> 00:31:38,518
l will check what you've just told me.

462
00:31:38,890 --> 00:31:40,755
But you must remain with us
for further questioning.

463
00:31:41,893 --> 00:31:43,053
No problem.

464
00:31:45,697 --> 00:31:48,131
Don't worry, l guarantee your safety.

465
00:31:48,766 --> 00:31:50,063
How about my brother?

466
00:31:51,369 --> 00:31:52,336
l'll handle it.

467
00:32:06,317 --> 00:32:09,184
What's Rosetta's file'?

468
00:32:11,222 --> 00:32:13,554
Just what the hell is that Rosetta file?

469
00:32:13,891 --> 00:32:15,950
lt's the ClA's personal Pincode file sir.

470
00:32:16,561 --> 00:32:18,222
He's saying that he works for the ClA.

471
00:32:21,265 --> 00:32:22,823
l'll be damned!

472
00:32:30,074 --> 00:32:31,974
We're letting you go. Sign this paper.

473
00:32:33,311 --> 00:32:34,437
How about my brother?

474
00:32:34,579 --> 00:32:36,069
He's leaving for the USA tonight.

475
00:32:37,115 --> 00:32:39,208
No, l have to see my brother.

476
00:32:39,917 --> 00:32:41,043
That's impossible!

477
00:32:41,285 --> 00:32:42,377
l must see him.

478
00:32:42,954 --> 00:32:45,286
- Don't start anything!
- What do you want?

479
00:32:45,423 --> 00:32:46,947
- l want to see my brother!
- Shut up!

480
00:32:47,091 --> 00:32:47,921
Get away from me! Don't touch me!

481
00:32:50,628 --> 00:32:51,822
- Don't try anything.
- l want to see my brother!

482
00:32:51,996 --> 00:32:53,395
Shut up...

483
00:32:54,399 --> 00:32:55,525
This is from your brother.

484
00:33:02,707 --> 00:33:04,072
- Fanny
- Yes!

485
00:33:05,476 --> 00:33:06,875
Why don't you take this kid away?

486
00:33:07,545 --> 00:33:08,773
l want you to join team C.

487
00:33:09,447 --> 00:33:11,039
Sir, l want to escort the prisoner.

488
00:33:14,285 --> 00:33:16,583
This is not a party, hurry up!

489
00:33:20,425 --> 00:33:22,154
Hurry up!

490
00:33:33,304 --> 00:33:34,999
You can catch a cab over there.

491
00:33:35,973 --> 00:33:37,668
Can you lend me some money?

492
00:33:39,977 --> 00:33:44,346
l'm sorry, we are really busy,
we can't give you a ride.

493
00:33:44,782 --> 00:33:45,976
How can l pay you back?

494
00:33:47,251 --> 00:33:48,809
l'll post the money back, okay?

495
00:33:51,122 --> 00:33:52,384
Call me.

496
00:33:54,792 --> 00:33:56,020
My name is Fanny.

497
00:34:00,531 --> 00:34:02,658
What?

498
00:34:05,002 --> 00:34:06,333
l've got a girlfriend.

499
00:34:06,471 --> 00:34:07,938
l've got a boyfriend, too.

500
00:34:57,455 --> 00:34:58,319
Please wait.

501
00:34:58,456 --> 00:34:59,548
Officer Ng, for you.

502
00:35:00,224 --> 00:35:01,452
Hello, Ronald Ng speaking.

503
00:35:01,592 --> 00:35:03,423
Don't let them out, it's not safe.

504
00:35:04,762 --> 00:35:05,820
Stop them.

505
00:35:09,066 --> 00:35:11,057
Stop them now, hurry up!

506
00:35:21,579 --> 00:35:23,570
The control room says to stop the car!
Stop them now!

507
00:36:07,091 --> 00:36:08,319
Greg!

508
00:36:09,527 --> 00:36:10,789
My feet!

509
00:36:13,364 --> 00:36:13,989
Greg!

510
00:36:14,131 --> 00:36:16,793
- Open up!
- Greg!

511
00:36:22,406 --> 00:36:24,704
Open up! Greg!

512
00:36:26,077 --> 00:36:27,601
Someone's been shot! Take cover! Hurry!

513
00:36:31,682 --> 00:36:33,172
On the ground! Take cover!

514
00:36:43,894 --> 00:36:45,384
Up there! On the roof opposite!

515
00:36:46,631 --> 00:36:47,757
Don't shoot!

516
00:36:47,898 --> 00:36:50,765
Greg! Get out of there!

517
00:37:51,262 --> 00:37:55,323
Greg!

518
00:37:56,100 --> 00:38:02,039
Greg!

519
00:38:12,049 --> 00:38:13,175
Stay here.

520
00:38:58,195 --> 00:38:59,423
Search the two rooms on the right.

521
00:39:15,479 --> 00:39:16,537
Wait for me at point B.

522
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:30,378
Move!

523
00:41:32,016 --> 00:41:33,176
Are you okay?

524
00:41:33,317 --> 00:41:34,477
Over there!

525
00:41:36,887 --> 00:41:39,117
Let go of me! Over there!

526
00:41:39,256 --> 00:41:40,848
Calm down!

527
00:41:40,991 --> 00:41:42,515
Let go of me!

528
00:41:42,660 --> 00:41:48,292
He's over there! l'm fine!

529
00:42:19,229 --> 00:42:20,992
l think you might be in danger.

530
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:25,800
lf you need help, call me.

531
00:42:28,639 --> 00:42:31,130
Kelvin, US secret service.

532
00:42:42,119 --> 00:42:44,314
l'm sorry there were so many casualties.

533
00:42:47,658 --> 00:42:49,922
l think somebody
wanted to silence Greg Li.

534
00:42:51,362 --> 00:42:52,522
We'll look into it.

535
00:42:54,164 --> 00:42:56,462
l'll fly to Singapore tomorrow
to explain things.

536
00:42:57,334 --> 00:42:59,063
l hope you can find out the truth.

537
00:43:45,683 --> 00:43:47,082
What happened?

538
00:43:52,990 --> 00:43:55,424
That's what everyone keeps asking me.

539
00:43:55,793 --> 00:43:57,420
l want to find out the answer for myself.

540
00:45:45,068 --> 00:45:46,000
What's the matter?

541
00:45:46,436 --> 00:45:47,835
We're being followed.

542
00:46:36,353 --> 00:46:37,479
Why are you tailing me?

543
00:46:37,721 --> 00:46:38,779
l'm not.

544
00:46:39,389 --> 00:46:40,515
Are you a cop?

545
00:46:41,258 --> 00:46:43,021
- No.
- Janet, call the police.

546
00:46:43,293 --> 00:46:43,952
Miss, please don't!

547
00:46:52,569 --> 00:46:54,127
Hello? Police? l want to make a report.

548
00:46:56,440 --> 00:46:57,270
No!

549
00:47:07,951 --> 00:47:09,043
l'm here to help you.

550
00:47:12,222 --> 00:47:13,951
- Who are you?
- l'm from Singapore.

551
00:47:14,091 --> 00:47:15,058
Another secret agent?

552
00:47:15,259 --> 00:47:16,385
What? A Singaporean secret agent?

553
00:47:16,526 --> 00:47:17,584
What are you doing here?

554
00:47:19,196 --> 00:47:21,824
Something happened in Singapore.
The investigation brought me here.

555
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:24,467
How much do you know
about your brother's murder?

556
00:47:29,940 --> 00:47:31,771
My name is Eric, Eric Ong.

557
00:47:32,242 --> 00:47:34,335
lf you get any information,
please call me.

558
00:47:34,511 --> 00:47:36,877
Why should he call you?
What good will it do him?

559
00:47:38,248 --> 00:47:39,579
We can pay you.

560
00:47:40,284 --> 00:47:41,308
How much?

561
00:47:44,354 --> 00:47:46,914
One hundred? One thousand?

562
00:47:47,557 --> 00:47:48,649
Or one million?

563
00:47:48,792 --> 00:47:50,726
We won't consider it
for less than 10 million.

564
00:47:52,396 --> 00:47:53,727
Do you think your information
is worth that much?

565
00:47:53,864 --> 00:47:56,196
Such an important case
is worth at least 10 million.

566
00:47:58,101 --> 00:47:59,329
l'll think about it.

567
00:48:03,106 --> 00:48:04,471
You'd better get going.

568
00:48:08,278 --> 00:48:09,472
What?

569
00:48:10,247 --> 00:48:11,612
Your film.

570
00:48:16,987 --> 00:48:18,682
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

571
00:48:20,390 --> 00:48:21,982
Why'd you do that?

572
00:48:23,026 --> 00:48:24,584
He doesn't seem like a bad guy.

573
00:48:26,496 --> 00:48:27,121
Let's go.

574
00:48:29,299 --> 00:48:30,197
What do you want?

575
00:48:31,068 --> 00:48:32,000
This is my flat!

576
00:48:32,135 --> 00:48:33,534
Show me your l.D. please.

577
00:48:33,670 --> 00:48:34,898
And yours too.

578
00:48:35,372 --> 00:48:38,239
Are you kidding? You want to
check my l.D. in my own home?

579
00:48:40,043 --> 00:48:42,477
- Let them in.
- Yes sir!

580
00:48:42,746 --> 00:48:45,510
Are you for real?
You never asked to search my home!

581
00:48:45,649 --> 00:48:51,110
We just want to look for any new leads.

582
00:48:51,321 --> 00:48:52,413
Sorry for the inconvenience.

583
00:49:19,516 --> 00:49:20,915
Be careful, please.

584
00:49:38,869 --> 00:49:40,166
Why did you break my savings box?

585
00:49:40,904 --> 00:49:42,735
Aren't you going to apologize
and compensate him?

586
00:49:49,346 --> 00:49:50,608
What happened?

587
00:49:51,415 --> 00:49:55,545
l wanted to check what was under
the savings box, he shouted, and...

588
00:50:01,758 --> 00:50:03,089
Was this savings box yours?

589
00:50:04,728 --> 00:50:06,559
My brother and l
saved the money together.

590
00:50:10,600 --> 00:50:13,660
l am sorry.

591
00:50:16,673 --> 00:50:17,765
Officer Ng.

592
00:50:20,277 --> 00:50:21,301
Peter

593
00:50:25,949 --> 00:50:30,318
My brother's dead.
l just can't believe he's gone...

594
00:50:39,362 --> 00:50:42,126
Janet, my friend, Benny.

595
00:50:43,166 --> 00:50:44,599
My brother's girlfriend, Salina.

596
00:50:45,368 --> 00:50:47,359
- This is Thomas.
- Hi, how are you?

597
00:50:47,504 --> 00:50:49,335
l went with Thomas to pick you up
at the police station.

598
00:50:49,473 --> 00:50:51,100
But they said you'd already gone home.

599
00:50:52,309 --> 00:50:53,640
What are they doing here?

600
00:50:54,111 --> 00:50:55,703
They want to search the place again.

601
00:50:56,680 --> 00:50:57,738
What are they looking for?

602
00:50:57,914 --> 00:51:01,213
l don't know.
l don't think even they know.

603
00:51:02,085 --> 00:51:06,044
Really! May l ask who is in charge here?

604
00:51:07,858 --> 00:51:10,383
What do you want? We've got a warrant.

605
00:51:10,727 --> 00:51:11,716
Are you a lawyer?

606
00:51:11,862 --> 00:51:13,830
No, l'm not a lawyer.

607
00:51:13,964 --> 00:51:16,489
l am a judge. Salina is my friend,

608
00:51:16,666 --> 00:51:18,691
l came to help her
find out more about this case.

609
00:51:18,869 --> 00:51:19,927
Thomas Tsang

610
00:51:20,670 --> 00:51:22,399
Ronald Ng, G.S.U.

611
00:51:22,572 --> 00:51:25,132
l see, judging from your vast experience,

612
00:51:25,275 --> 00:51:27,436
You wouldn't allow an unnecessary search
or unlawful detention, right?

613
00:51:27,577 --> 00:51:30,842
And you wouldn't damage anything
not relevant to this case, right?

614
00:51:32,649 --> 00:51:33,809
l'll try my best.

615
00:52:02,679 --> 00:52:04,169
This computer is broken.

616
00:52:18,495 --> 00:52:19,519
Thank you.

617
00:52:28,338 --> 00:52:30,169
Be careful! Let me help you.

618
00:52:36,379 --> 00:52:38,870
What's this? A key!

619
00:52:39,082 --> 00:52:41,983
lt's Greg's key,
the key to a safety deposit box.

620
00:52:42,185 --> 00:52:43,618
- Call the police.
- No!

621
00:52:44,120 --> 00:52:45,382
We don't know what's inside.

622
00:52:45,555 --> 00:52:47,580
lf there is something
that might incriminate Greg,

623
00:52:47,724 --> 00:52:48,850
then we can burn it..

624
00:52:49,326 --> 00:52:51,317
Yes, we can check what's inside.

625
00:52:51,528 --> 00:52:52,995
Maybe we can sell it.

626
00:52:53,129 --> 00:52:55,222
But we need Greg's l.D. to open his box.

627
00:52:55,432 --> 00:52:56,592
l have his l.D. card.

628
00:52:56,766 --> 00:52:57,926
How about his signature?

629
00:52:58,802 --> 00:52:59,894
Practice forging it.

630
00:53:01,037 --> 00:53:02,527
This is illegal! You shouldn't do it.

631
00:53:05,542 --> 00:53:06,907
Your l.D. card, please.

632
00:53:14,384 --> 00:53:16,978
l love you.

633
00:53:18,054 --> 00:53:19,453
Mr. Li, please sign here.

634
00:53:19,589 --> 00:53:20,613
l'll get the key.

635
00:53:40,777 --> 00:53:41,937
Mr. Li, this way please.

636
00:53:59,529 --> 00:54:01,588
- lt's locked.
- Let's try and open it later.

637
00:56:02,085 --> 00:56:02,881
Get down!

638
00:58:11,047 --> 00:58:13,914
Relax. Just pretend
we're playing a videogame.

639
00:58:14,884 --> 00:58:17,819
But, if we lose, we can't put in
some coins for another round. Be careful!

640
00:58:18,254 --> 00:58:20,518
Where is Salina? Have you seen her?

641
00:58:21,558 --> 00:58:22,957
You'd better take care.

642
00:58:23,927 --> 00:58:25,417
Salina is a mystery.

643
00:58:25,895 --> 00:58:28,989
l couldn't find out
anything about her past.

644
00:58:44,881 --> 00:58:48,510
Don't worry, l've called for back-up.

645
00:58:49,419 --> 00:58:50,613
They're on the way.

646
00:58:52,121 --> 00:58:53,418
We just wait.

647
00:58:56,459 --> 00:58:57,949
This is business as usual
for a civil servant.

648
00:59:06,369 --> 00:59:07,427
Officer Ng!

649
00:59:09,439 --> 00:59:10,770
Officer Ng!

650
00:59:15,878 --> 00:59:18,369
Officer Ng!

651
00:59:19,716 --> 00:59:22,344
Wake up! Wake up!

652
00:59:49,412 --> 00:59:50,310
Get in!

653
00:59:54,350 --> 00:59:55,146
Move!

654
01:01:07,590 --> 01:01:09,217
What's inside?

655
01:01:10,059 --> 01:01:11,959
The key to a deposit box
at the Singapore National Bank.

656
01:01:12,829 --> 01:01:13,818
Which one?

657
01:01:14,597 --> 01:01:15,791
Where is it?

658
01:01:16,766 --> 01:01:17,960
lt's in Singapore.

659
01:01:28,878 --> 01:01:31,039
Janet, listen.

660
01:01:31,180 --> 01:01:33,580
Salina and l need to fly to Singapore.

661
01:01:33,783 --> 01:01:36,718
Bring my passport
and meet me at the airport.

662
01:01:36,919 --> 01:01:39,080
And bring me some clothes.

663
01:01:39,889 --> 01:01:42,824
There's no time to explain. Just hurry!

664
01:01:52,935 --> 01:01:56,098
They won't kill you for a birth
certificate or a graduation document.

665
01:01:56,339 --> 01:01:57,738
What was Greg involved in?

666
01:01:57,907 --> 01:01:59,033
What did he leave in Singapore?

667
01:01:59,375 --> 01:02:00,706
Janet and l are coming with you.

668
01:02:01,077 --> 01:02:02,544
We're not going there to play around!

669
01:02:02,678 --> 01:02:04,737
l know, l just want to back you up.

670
01:02:05,381 --> 01:02:07,076
You, okay, but what about Janet?

671
01:02:07,250 --> 01:02:08,842
lf you can convince her, go ahead.

672
01:02:10,219 --> 01:02:11,311
Have you bought the tickets?

673
01:02:13,089 --> 01:02:13,987
What's up?

674
01:02:14,223 --> 01:02:16,384
lt's too dangerous. You'd better not go.

675
01:02:16,893 --> 01:02:17,757
What about you?

676
01:02:17,894 --> 01:02:19,361
l can handle it myself.

677
01:02:19,729 --> 01:02:21,629
This cheque is for you.

678
01:02:23,432 --> 01:02:24,558
Why are you giving me so much money?

679
01:02:24,700 --> 01:02:26,065
l know you need it.

680
01:02:26,269 --> 01:02:28,066
lf l find anything valuable,

681
01:02:28,204 --> 01:02:29,933
l'll bring it back to you.

682
01:02:30,373 --> 01:02:31,806
Why are you taking this risk?

683
01:02:32,608 --> 01:02:34,098
He was my fiance.

684
01:02:34,277 --> 01:02:35,767
He was my brother.

685
01:02:36,179 --> 01:02:37,976
My only brother.

686
01:02:38,781 --> 01:02:40,510
l must find out the truth.

687
01:02:44,620 --> 01:02:46,520
One whole GSU unit was wiped out.

688
01:02:46,656 --> 01:02:47,816
Who did it?

689
01:02:48,024 --> 01:02:49,719
They were ambushed by Kelvin's men.

690
01:02:50,059 --> 01:02:52,152
l think they wanted something from Peter.

691
01:02:52,795 --> 01:02:55,025
- ls it the program?
- l'm not sure.

692
01:02:55,331 --> 01:02:56,559
l don't think Peter knows either.

693
01:02:56,699 --> 01:02:58,166
Are you sure this guy's not involved?

694
01:02:58,301 --> 01:02:59,632
Peter is clean, sir.

695
01:03:00,336 --> 01:03:01,564
So where is he now?

696
01:03:02,104 --> 01:03:03,366
He got away.

697
01:03:03,739 --> 01:03:06,902
A whole G.S.U. team wiped out,
and he escaped? How?

698
01:03:08,077 --> 01:03:09,704
Well, that girl Salina.

699
01:03:09,912 --> 01:03:11,345
She... she drove him.

700
01:03:12,048 --> 01:03:13,538
And you... what did you do?

701
01:03:15,852 --> 01:03:17,979
l...

702
01:03:21,057 --> 01:03:24,390
- l fired a few shots, sir...
- You fired a few shots?

703
01:03:25,261 --> 01:03:26,421
l had no choice, sir!

704
01:03:26,562 --> 01:03:28,291
You are right, that is not a choice.

705
01:03:28,431 --> 01:03:31,059
l can't have a Singapore agent
starting a war with the ClA.

706
01:03:31,200 --> 01:03:33,964
Sir, sir, just a tiny one.

707
01:03:34,103 --> 01:03:35,092
Look, l don't care, all right.

708
01:03:35,238 --> 01:03:37,570
You were supposed
to keep this thing low profile,

709
01:03:37,707 --> 01:03:39,072
And now you are making
headlines over there!

710
01:03:39,242 --> 01:03:40,436
You better come back to Singapore now.

711
01:03:40,877 --> 01:03:42,970
- Sir...
- And one more thing,

712
01:03:43,145 --> 01:03:45,010
Where did you get the weapon?

713
01:03:45,882 --> 01:03:47,941
l don't think you want to know sir...

714
01:04:28,224 --> 01:04:29,486
Does it fit?

715
01:04:30,826 --> 01:04:31,952
Yes, thank you.

716
01:04:45,942 --> 01:04:48,410
Are you going to forge
your brother's name again tomorrow?

717
01:04:48,978 --> 01:04:51,037
Why won't you listen to me?
Call the police!

718
01:04:51,681 --> 01:04:52,841
Call Eric.

719
01:04:52,982 --> 01:04:55,382
Didn't you say he saved
your life at the car park?

720
01:04:58,054 --> 01:04:58,884
What do you think?

721
01:04:59,021 --> 01:05:01,353
lt's up to you. Do what you want.

722
01:05:01,524 --> 01:05:03,355
l just don't want
to share a room with Janet.

723
01:05:03,492 --> 01:05:05,289
There's only one bed, l'm not used to it.

724
01:05:05,628 --> 01:05:07,425
There are two beds in Benny's room.

725
01:05:09,332 --> 01:05:10,458
That's fine by me!

726
01:05:26,082 --> 01:05:27,481
What's your problem?

727
01:05:30,753 --> 01:05:32,243
Ever since the ambush in the car park,

728
01:05:32,688 --> 01:05:35,156
You've looked at me
like l'm your enemy. Why?

729
01:05:37,059 --> 01:05:38,754
l really want to know something.

730
01:05:39,662 --> 01:05:41,323
Why weren't you hurt in the car park?

731
01:05:42,565 --> 01:05:44,965
How did you drive my car without my key?

732
01:05:46,135 --> 01:05:47,500
How come you carry
a set of skeleton keys?

733
01:05:47,903 --> 01:05:50,633
Officer Ng told me that you have no past.

734
01:05:50,773 --> 01:05:52,035
Just who the hell are you?

735
01:05:52,541 --> 01:05:53,803
How did you meet my brother?

736
01:06:04,887 --> 01:06:06,286
l wasn't called Salina then.

737
01:06:07,690 --> 01:06:08,987
When l first knew your brother,

738
01:06:09,125 --> 01:06:11,116
l was a club girl
in a Singapore nightclub.

739
01:06:16,399 --> 01:06:19,266
l was a hooker before, okay?

740
01:06:20,069 --> 01:06:22,629
l know how to steal cars.

741
01:06:26,175 --> 01:06:27,733
l met your brother at the nightclub.

742
01:06:28,377 --> 01:06:30,641
He asked me to go to the USA with him.

743
01:06:33,783 --> 01:06:35,273
So l became his secretary.

744
01:06:44,326 --> 01:06:46,055
He wanted me to forget my past.

745
01:06:48,064 --> 01:06:51,261
Salina is the name he liked most.

746
01:07:11,120 --> 01:07:13,247
Let's call the police tomorrow morning.

747
01:07:15,925 --> 01:07:17,517
Let's convince Peter together.

748
01:07:18,160 --> 01:07:18,785
All right.

749
01:07:20,570 --> 01:07:22,037
What's wrong with the memory?

750
01:07:22,739 --> 01:07:23,831
Trying to mess with me?

751
01:07:25,108 --> 01:07:26,803
l'll show you who's boss!

752
01:07:29,279 --> 01:07:31,008
Okay, l'll fix you tomorrow.

753
01:07:33,884 --> 01:07:35,044
l'm going to bed now.

754
01:07:39,956 --> 01:07:43,323
This is the first time
l've experienced such feelings...

755
01:07:44,461 --> 01:07:45,689
What feelings?

756
01:07:46,596 --> 01:07:49,429
l think l'm in love.

757
01:08:00,343 --> 01:08:01,241
Goodnight!

758
01:08:02,579 --> 01:08:03,637
Goodnight.

759
01:08:23,266 --> 01:08:24,062
Where is Salina?

760
01:08:24,201 --> 01:08:25,828
She's changing.

761
01:08:26,036 --> 01:08:28,402
You know, women take
a long time to get changed.

762
01:08:28,538 --> 01:08:30,369
l've been waiting for an hour.

763
01:08:35,746 --> 01:08:40,206
Salina...

764
01:08:44,254 --> 01:08:45,551
Salina...

765
01:08:59,269 --> 01:09:01,533
Miss, where are the safety deposit boxes?

766
01:09:02,172 --> 01:09:04,140
Over there, sir, down the stairs.

767
01:09:46,783 --> 01:09:48,216
You got to help us! Help us!

768
01:09:48,418 --> 01:09:52,047
Go... get the red car. Go... go...

769
01:09:58,528 --> 01:10:01,190
There is a car jack on Battery Road,
all units respond.

770
01:10:01,331 --> 01:10:03,856
Car jacking proceeding on Battery Road,

771
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:05,592
heading for North Bridge Road
is driving a police car.

772
01:14:11,414 --> 01:14:12,312
Want some candy?

773
01:14:14,184 --> 01:14:15,242
Okay.

774
01:14:21,491 --> 01:14:22,788
l want to talk to you.

775
01:14:33,503 --> 01:14:34,401
Do you want to arrest us?

776
01:14:37,407 --> 01:14:39,773
My orders are to get you back
to Hong Kong as soon as possible.

777
01:14:41,811 --> 01:14:43,176
The HK police need you
to help with their investigation

778
01:14:43,313 --> 01:14:44,712
of the gun battle in the car park.

779
01:14:46,850 --> 01:14:47,942
l want your help.

780
01:14:49,919 --> 01:14:51,511
Don't tell them l was there.

781
01:14:52,555 --> 01:14:54,887
Otherwise, l'll be in deep shit.

782
01:14:56,626 --> 01:14:57,684
Thank you for saving me.

783
01:14:59,195 --> 01:15:00,560
Sorry l couldn't save your brother.

784
01:15:02,165 --> 01:15:03,530
Do you know who wanted him dead?

785
01:15:06,236 --> 01:15:08,466
Knowing too much isn't good for you.

786
01:15:09,939 --> 01:15:11,497
But l can tell you one thing.

787
01:15:11,841 --> 01:15:13,968
l believe your brother was innocent.

788
01:15:18,548 --> 01:15:19,572
How about Salina?

789
01:15:23,086 --> 01:15:24,678
l've already said too much.

790
01:15:25,221 --> 01:15:26,711
Just forget it.

791
01:15:27,190 --> 01:15:28,248
No.

792
01:15:28,458 --> 01:15:29,618
You've got no choice.

793
01:15:29,792 --> 01:15:31,123
You can't afford to play this game.

794
01:15:31,261 --> 01:15:32,922
l really have no choice.

795
01:15:33,229 --> 01:15:34,696
Officer Ng was right.

796
01:15:34,998 --> 01:15:37,660
l can't quit this game
and start another one.

797
01:15:37,800 --> 01:15:39,859
Now l've begun,
l have to play it to the end.

798
01:15:41,337 --> 01:15:43,362
Tell me, please!

799
01:15:47,877 --> 01:15:48,969
l'm sorry.

800
01:15:52,382 --> 01:15:53,440
Yes sir!

801
01:15:53,850 --> 01:15:55,477
- Take them back to the hotel.
- Yes sir!

802
01:15:55,618 --> 01:15:57,085
And then send them
straight to the airport.

803
01:15:57,720 --> 01:16:01,451
Remember, they are our guests,
not prisoners.

804
01:16:01,591 --> 01:16:02,717
Yes sir!

805
01:16:14,204 --> 01:16:15,694
We have to do something sir.

806
01:16:16,005 --> 01:16:17,472
The bad guys are just running around.

807
01:16:17,774 --> 01:16:20,766
We need proof, we can't
accuse people without evidence.

808
01:16:27,450 --> 01:16:28,849
This is not right.

809
01:16:30,320 --> 01:16:31,582
l know.

810
01:16:37,694 --> 01:16:39,355
He had no choice.

811
01:16:42,732 --> 01:16:44,199
You forgot?

812
01:16:44,667 --> 01:16:45,793
What?

813
01:16:45,935 --> 01:16:48,335
Today is your birthday.

814
01:16:51,174 --> 01:16:52,300
l've been so busy!

815
01:16:52,775 --> 01:16:55,801
l don't have any date tonight.
Let's eat out, okay?

816
01:16:59,649 --> 01:17:00,877
l'll call you.

817
01:17:01,017 --> 01:17:02,143
Okay.

818
01:17:23,072 --> 01:17:25,563
Oh... That's it?
That's the Caller Program?

819
01:17:25,842 --> 01:17:27,833
No. Just some goddamned love letter.

820
01:17:29,345 --> 01:17:30,972
He really loved you so much.

821
01:17:31,114 --> 01:17:33,708
He kept all the e-mails
that you sent him.

822
01:17:39,489 --> 01:17:46,258
Jewellery ring from Tiffany,
and love letters, too. So romantic.

823
01:17:46,462 --> 01:17:47,520
Ryan

824
01:17:50,833 --> 01:17:54,166
- Bobby, it's yours!
- Thank you!

825
01:17:56,072 --> 01:17:57,130
Mike!

826
01:18:02,945 --> 01:18:05,539
That's mine. lt belonged to my grandma.

827
01:18:07,717 --> 01:18:10,311
A lover's gift? So corny!

828
01:18:12,955 --> 01:18:14,650
Remember, you are my woman.

829
01:18:16,092 --> 01:18:19,186
Sorry, you were my client before.

830
01:18:19,762 --> 01:18:21,423
Now, you are my boss.

831
01:18:21,597 --> 01:18:23,030
Was he your lover?

832
01:18:23,466 --> 01:18:26,367
Don't forget, you're the one
who stole the design and the program.

833
01:18:27,337 --> 01:18:28,770
lf l kill you now,

834
01:18:29,138 --> 01:18:30,867
there'll be no evidence
to incriminate me.

835
01:18:31,941 --> 01:18:33,431
But l won't do this.

836
01:18:34,410 --> 01:18:36,378
Because l'd miss the way
you moan when we have sex.

837
01:18:40,717 --> 01:18:42,150
Don't make me change my mind.

838
01:18:44,854 --> 01:18:45,912
Let's go.

839
01:18:46,823 --> 01:18:48,814
Alex says he will finish
the Caller Program today.

840
01:18:53,696 --> 01:18:55,459
Take it easy. He's a jerk.

841
01:18:57,066 --> 01:18:58,431
Why do you stay with them?

842
01:18:58,601 --> 01:19:00,967
Don't worry,
l'll leave after l get my money.

843
01:19:08,811 --> 01:19:09,778
Bon voyage!

844
01:19:11,114 --> 01:19:12,172
Bon voyage!

845
01:19:45,314 --> 01:19:47,407
Hey, don't worry.

846
01:19:47,717 --> 01:19:50,277
l've never seen you lose at any game.

847
01:19:54,257 --> 01:19:55,986
Playing games is all l know.

848
01:19:57,460 --> 01:19:58,620
Aren't you afraid?

849
01:19:59,228 --> 01:20:03,756
Yes, l am. lf you don't work hard,
l'll leave you!

850
01:20:05,501 --> 01:20:06,661
You'll really leave me?

851
01:20:07,737 --> 01:20:10,069
Sure! l'll run as fast as l can.

852
01:20:14,010 --> 01:20:16,171
Peter, Peter, come here!

853
01:20:18,481 --> 01:20:19,539
What's the matter?

854
01:20:19,849 --> 01:20:21,783
l've found an extra program
in my computer.

855
01:20:22,485 --> 01:20:23,543
Look!

856
01:20:24,554 --> 01:20:26,613
l think Greg loaded it.

857
01:20:28,324 --> 01:20:30,155
l don't know what it is. Look!

858
01:21:16,506 --> 01:21:17,632
l'm going to be rich.

859
01:21:18,207 --> 01:21:19,674
Everybody's going to be rich.

860
01:21:20,476 --> 01:21:23,343
OK, let's get into the National Bank.

861
01:21:23,880 --> 01:21:25,108
National Bank!

862
01:21:25,882 --> 01:21:27,042
Yeah, what's the problem?

863
01:21:27,350 --> 01:21:30,046
Well, the first part's not finished yet.

864
01:21:30,253 --> 01:21:31,277
What do you mean it's not finished?

865
01:21:31,420 --> 01:21:34,617
You have to understand, the sleeper
program has two functions, yeah?

866
01:21:34,790 --> 01:21:38,954
And there's destroy
and one function and the control.

867
01:21:39,395 --> 01:21:42,159
And, so far we've only got
the destroy function going.

868
01:21:42,298 --> 01:21:45,961
OK, then how long does it take
you to do the second part?

869
01:21:46,769 --> 01:21:49,363
- About a month.
- A month, huh?

870
01:21:49,839 --> 01:21:52,171
After what we did
to the stock exchange market,

871
01:21:52,842 --> 01:21:54,901
the whole world will be
checking the sleeper lC,

872
01:21:55,378 --> 01:21:56,936
And you need a month?

873
01:21:57,747 --> 01:21:59,476
Why didn't you tell me
the program is not finished?

874
01:21:59,615 --> 01:22:01,879
You've got to cut me
some slack here, cowboy.

875
01:22:02,818 --> 01:22:04,445
You said you want
to see something, otherwise.

876
01:22:04,587 --> 01:22:06,817
Yeah, otherwise,
l'll damn well kill you.

877
01:22:09,325 --> 01:22:10,451
So what now?

878
01:22:10,593 --> 01:22:12,254
l thought we'd struck it rich!

879
01:22:12,395 --> 01:22:15,387
You promised me 10 million
US dollars from this deal.

880
01:22:15,598 --> 01:22:16,929
Let's sell the damn thing.

881
01:22:17,066 --> 01:22:18,693
Right, the Russians will love this.

882
01:22:18,901 --> 01:22:21,165
- They won't have money.
- l'm not talking about the government.

883
01:22:21,304 --> 01:22:23,864
l'm talking about the Mafia.
They're rich.

884
01:22:24,073 --> 01:22:25,631
We make a deal with the Mafia,
we'll be dead meat!

885
01:22:25,775 --> 01:22:27,106
Shut up! Shut the hell up!

886
01:22:32,448 --> 01:22:35,281
All right men,
l got no time for this bullshit.

887
01:22:36,619 --> 01:22:38,143
No more killing!

888
01:22:39,388 --> 01:22:41,982
Cowboy, cut me some slack. Huh?

889
01:22:49,298 --> 01:22:52,893
Who's this? Peter?

890
01:22:53,035 --> 01:22:54,332
Yes, this is Greg's brother.

891
01:22:54,470 --> 01:22:56,563
l'm in Singapore. l need your help.

892
01:22:56,706 --> 01:22:57,604
What's going on?

893
01:22:57,807 --> 01:22:58,865
l've found a program loaded by Greg.

894
01:22:59,075 --> 01:23:00,736
l don't understand it.
l want you to take a look.

895
01:23:00,943 --> 01:23:01,910
Did you let anyone see it?

896
01:23:02,111 --> 01:23:04,875
No, l don't trust anyone else.

897
01:23:08,584 --> 01:23:11,644
All right, see you later.

898
01:23:14,590 --> 01:23:15,818
- What's going on?
- Let's go.

899
01:23:53,095 --> 01:23:53,993
Water, please.

900
01:24:09,645 --> 01:24:12,113
We suspected that he stole this program.

901
01:24:13,115 --> 01:24:16,016
Besides this program,
he left some e-mail messages.

902
01:24:16,252 --> 01:24:18,311
He told his boss
that someone stole his data.

903
01:24:18,454 --> 01:24:19,580
Let me take a look.

904
01:24:21,357 --> 01:24:22,824
Who is Salina?

905
01:24:23,526 --> 01:24:25,391
l don't think my brother
stole the program.

906
01:24:25,561 --> 01:24:26,789
l think Salina did.

907
01:24:26,929 --> 01:24:28,988
Those e-mails can prove that
my brother is innocent.

908
01:24:29,465 --> 01:24:30,898
Fine, give me the computer.

909
01:24:31,067 --> 01:24:32,398
And l'll use it to prove
your brother's innocence.

910
01:24:33,836 --> 01:24:35,064
l won't trust anyone else.

911
01:24:35,271 --> 01:24:36,465
So what do you want to do?

912
01:24:37,139 --> 01:24:38,629
Sir, your water.

913
01:24:41,343 --> 01:24:42,401
Thank you.

914
01:24:49,318 --> 01:24:51,183
We don't need anything, thank you.

915
01:24:56,492 --> 01:24:57,789
Who is Salina?

916
01:24:58,494 --> 01:24:59,893
Who killed my brother?

917
01:25:00,529 --> 01:25:01,791
l think you know.

918
01:25:04,433 --> 01:25:05,764
lf you don't tell me,

919
01:25:07,269 --> 01:25:09,100
l'll reveal everything to the press.

920
01:25:11,140 --> 01:25:12,573
Don't cheat me.

921
01:25:13,109 --> 01:25:15,441
This program can be used
to destroy a computer system.

922
01:25:17,947 --> 01:25:20,279
You're really smart.
l don't want to cheat you.

923
01:25:21,317 --> 01:25:22,978
But this is not the right place
to talk about it.

924
01:25:23,886 --> 01:25:24,511
Let's go.

925
01:25:24,687 --> 01:25:26,951
You should let me go up there.

926
01:25:28,290 --> 01:25:30,588
l think you'll only cause more trouble.

927
01:25:31,560 --> 01:25:32,959
Let's go.

928
01:25:48,110 --> 01:25:49,805
You killed my brother.

929
01:25:51,547 --> 01:25:52,912
As l said, you're really smart.

930
01:25:57,353 --> 01:25:58,377
Watch the door.

931
01:30:18,180 --> 01:30:19,306
What's the matter?

932
01:30:19,548 --> 01:30:21,277
l am going to tail him,
turn on your phone.

933
01:30:32,795 --> 01:30:33,762
Are you okay?

934
01:30:34,029 --> 01:30:35,121
They got the computer.

935
01:30:37,232 --> 01:30:38,859
- l thought you were dead.
- Me, too.

936
01:30:59,421 --> 01:31:01,821
Hello, Peter? Yes, it's Benny.

937
01:31:02,458 --> 01:31:04,187
Yes, l'm tailing them.

938
01:31:04,660 --> 01:31:06,093
One of them is dressed like a cowboy.

939
01:31:06,428 --> 01:31:09,556
And one of them is carrying my computer.

940
01:31:10,966 --> 01:31:12,763
Where am l? l don't know.

941
01:31:13,836 --> 01:31:15,463
Excuse me, what's this building?

942
01:31:15,604 --> 01:31:17,037
- This is the Convention Centre.
- Thank you.

943
01:31:17,206 --> 01:31:19,231
This is the Convention Centre,
come here right away.

944
01:32:07,222 --> 01:32:08,018
Good technique!

945
01:32:18,767 --> 01:32:20,200
Sir, they're over there.

946
01:32:24,940 --> 01:32:26,373
- Everyone here?
- Yes.

947
01:32:26,575 --> 01:32:27,872
Sir, the Colonel's on the phone.

948
01:32:31,079 --> 01:32:32,068
Shit!

949
01:32:33,382 --> 01:32:34,576
Sir, Eric.

950
01:32:34,816 --> 01:32:37,717
Ah, l've been trying to call you
for hours, why didn't you answer?

951
01:32:39,388 --> 01:32:40,855
Sorry sir, l...

952
01:32:41,190 --> 01:32:42,748
l've got your orders for you!

953
01:32:43,959 --> 01:32:46,553
- Sir, please listen to me...
- No... you listen to me.

954
01:32:46,695 --> 01:32:48,492
l've already complained to the Americans

955
01:32:48,630 --> 01:32:51,394
that their agents are acting
outside of their jurisdiction.

956
01:32:51,533 --> 01:32:53,330
They have confirmed that this operation
is not approved by their government.

957
01:32:53,569 --> 01:32:54,501
So...

958
01:32:54,636 --> 01:32:57,400
So? So arrest them. All of them!

959
01:32:58,440 --> 01:33:00,032
But you always told me
not to get involved.

960
01:33:00,175 --> 01:33:02,803
Yes. But now this is our turf,

961
01:33:02,945 --> 01:33:04,378
The info is all in the data bank already.

962
01:33:04,513 --> 01:33:06,037
You move in now.

963
01:33:06,281 --> 01:33:07,748
Got it!

964
01:33:10,819 --> 01:33:13,344
OK, listen up!
The order is immediate arrest.

965
01:33:13,488 --> 01:33:15,854
The suspects are armed,
they are very dangerous.

966
01:33:15,991 --> 01:33:18,289
When you go into action,
stay aware of any by-standers.

967
01:33:18,460 --> 01:33:19,950
- You understand?
- Yes sir!

968
01:33:20,095 --> 01:33:22,290
Alex!

969
01:33:22,464 --> 01:33:24,728
Big boy, we got it,

970
01:33:24,933 --> 01:33:26,833
We did it, we blow this sucker up.

971
01:33:26,969 --> 01:33:28,163
The C drive's ready?

972
01:33:28,303 --> 01:33:31,136
lt's in there, six pack ready
to go there. Big guy.

973
01:33:32,474 --> 01:33:38,344
Let's see, let's see. Just like we said,
we pulled it off. Case closed.

974
01:33:46,421 --> 01:33:47,615
Nobody move!

975
01:33:48,924 --> 01:33:51,654
Benny, take the computer, hurry!

976
01:33:55,163 --> 01:33:56,289
Take the box away too.

977
01:34:01,169 --> 01:34:02,329
Hurry up!

978
01:34:08,677 --> 01:34:10,440
Watch all the exits.

979
01:34:40,509 --> 01:34:41,567
Tom, you stay here,

980
01:34:41,710 --> 01:34:44,144
Make sure they don't get out.

981
01:34:44,479 --> 01:34:45,446
All right, guys. Let's go get them.

982
01:34:55,590 --> 01:34:56,579
See anything?

983
01:34:57,192 --> 01:34:58,181
No, sir!

984
01:35:12,908 --> 01:35:14,967
- Peter!
- Where are you?

985
01:35:15,110 --> 01:35:17,203
- Concourse, on the third floor.
- Concourse on the third floor?

986
01:35:17,946 --> 01:35:19,174
All units, go to the concourse.

987
01:35:27,322 --> 01:35:28,550
Hey, up there!

988
01:35:30,759 --> 01:35:31,885
Where?

989
01:35:34,062 --> 01:35:36,155
Down there, can you see that?

990
01:35:36,665 --> 01:35:37,632
Down there.

991
01:36:31,720 --> 01:36:32,880
Send the people out!

992
01:36:33,655 --> 01:36:34,622
Move...

993
01:36:38,059 --> 01:36:40,459
Move...

994
01:36:44,533 --> 01:36:46,000
Sit down, sit down!

995
01:36:46,902 --> 01:36:48,130
Benny

996
01:36:50,338 --> 01:36:51,737
- Don't panic.
- Set it up.

997
01:36:53,041 --> 01:36:54,668
You'll be okay!

998
01:36:55,277 --> 01:36:56,403
Hurry up!

999
01:36:58,213 --> 01:36:59,305
You can't escape.

1000
01:37:03,018 --> 01:37:05,384
lf l still see these cops
in one minute's time,

1001
01:37:05,687 --> 01:37:07,848
l'll destroy all
the computer systems at once.

1002
01:37:08,657 --> 01:37:09,715
Don't try and bluff me.

1003
01:37:15,263 --> 01:37:16,389
l don't need to bluff.

1004
01:37:21,603 --> 01:37:24,868
Check the First General Hospital, okay?

1005
01:37:25,273 --> 01:37:26,331
Don't make things worse for yourself!

1006
01:37:26,541 --> 01:37:27,667
You still have fifty seconds.

1007
01:37:34,115 --> 01:37:37,676
Everybody step back! Back...

1008
01:37:43,291 --> 01:37:44,223
Peter

1009
01:37:57,772 --> 01:37:59,000
You'll let so many people die...

1010
01:38:20,028 --> 01:38:20,995
No, Peter!

1011
01:38:43,585 --> 01:38:45,553
- Are you all right?
- l'm okay.

1012
01:38:47,355 --> 01:38:49,016
lf the gun hadn't jammed,

1013
01:38:49,357 --> 01:38:51,188
you'd be a murderer now.

1014
01:38:52,527 --> 01:38:53,687
He wasn't worth it.

1015
01:38:56,932 --> 01:38:58,160
Want some candy?

1016
01:39:04,573 --> 01:39:05,540
See you later.

1017
01:39:07,709 --> 01:39:11,236
You always do the opposite
of what l tell you!

1018
01:39:14,816 --> 01:39:16,249
You're so bad!

1019
01:39:32,667 --> 01:39:34,396
The doctor said you'll be fine.

1020
01:39:35,637 --> 01:39:36,865
You're very brave!

1021
01:39:39,074 --> 01:39:40,063
l know!
