Previously on <i>Alphas...</i>

2
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:03,288
Gary and I just found
something that is huge.

3
00:00:03,469 --> 00:00:05,284
- Stanton Parish.
- This is from the Civil War.

4
00:00:05,368 --> 00:00:06,835
He was about
40 years old, right?

5
00:00:06,903 --> 00:00:09,804
Same guy,
100 years later.

6
00:00:09,872 --> 00:00:12,717
War
it's inevitable,

7
00:00:12,785 --> 00:00:14,554
in two years, maybe three.

8
00:00:14,622 --> 00:00:16,625
Nothing that you or I
can do to stop that.

9
00:00:28,277 --> 00:00:30,710
[Sighs]

10
00:00:32,345 --> 00:00:34,849
Bill, you all right?

11
00:00:40,391 --> 00:00:44,526
It's too early.

12
00:00:44,594 --> 00:00:46,598
Come back to bed
and warm me up.

13
00:00:46,666 --> 00:00:48,000
[Chuckles]

14
00:00:48,068 --> 00:00:50,503
In fact, you know what?
Why don't we both call in sick--

15
00:00:50,571 --> 00:00:53,673
No, no. I-
I-I've got to go to work.

16
00:00:55,408 --> 00:00:57,576
Bill, you need a break.

17
00:00:57,643 --> 00:00:58,777
You've been so stressed,

18
00:00:58,845 --> 00:01:00,078
and those pills
are not working anymore.

19
00:01:00,145 --> 00:01:03,982
Jeannie, I--
[Sighs]

20
00:01:04,049 --> 00:01:05,584
Jeannie, I got this.

21
00:01:05,653 --> 00:01:09,489
Okay?

22
00:01:09,557 --> 00:01:12,393
I gotta go.

23
00:01:30,748 --> 00:01:33,049
Gary?
Breakfast.

24
00:01:33,116 --> 00:01:36,085
In a minute.

25
00:01:36,153 --> 00:01:38,954
[Screaming loudly]

26
00:01:55,974 --> 00:01:58,543
[Footsteps approaching]

27
00:02:07,521 --> 00:02:10,424
It sounds to me like it's
a cathartic release, Sandra.

28
00:02:10,491 --> 00:02:12,994
It's releasing some tension
and some stress, you know?

29
00:02:13,062 --> 00:02:14,763
It's--it's basically
a coping mechanism.

30
00:02:14,831 --> 00:02:16,565
No, I-it's happening
every day, Lee.

31
00:02:16,632 --> 00:02:17,599
That's not coping.

32
00:02:17,668 --> 00:02:19,101
They locked him up.

33
00:02:19,169 --> 00:02:21,737
They put a metal chip
in his head, for God's sake.

34
00:02:21,805 --> 00:02:23,273
He's gone back to work
way too soon.

35
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:25,742
Well, Sandra,
Gary needs to work.

36
00:02:25,810 --> 00:02:27,210
It's good for him,
you know that.

37
00:02:27,278 --> 00:02:29,112
He really needs
to talk to somebody

38
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:30,514
about what happened to him.

39
00:02:30,582 --> 00:02:32,650
Listen, I-I'm on my way
to pick him up now.

40
00:02:32,718 --> 00:02:35,287
I'll find some time today
to speak with him.

41
00:02:35,354 --> 00:02:39,525
I mean, you know
that I love my parents to death,

42
00:02:39,593 --> 00:02:41,561
but they're all over me again.

43
00:02:41,628 --> 00:02:44,164
I mean, all of the sudden,
it's like, "where are you going?

44
00:02:44,232 --> 00:02:45,366
"How late are you
gonna be at work?

45
00:02:45,433 --> 00:02:46,600
Are you being safe?"

46
00:02:46,668 --> 00:02:48,703
They need to understand
that I'm an adult

47
00:02:48,770 --> 00:02:50,405
and that I'm gonna do
what I want to do.

48
00:02:50,472 --> 00:02:51,439
[Muttering] I'm gonna do
what I want to do.

49
00:02:51,507 --> 00:02:52,707
Yeah, exactly, Gary.

50
00:02:52,775 --> 00:02:54,442
Well, perhaps
you should look into getting

51
00:02:54,510 --> 00:02:55,811
your own apartment again.

52
00:02:55,879 --> 00:02:57,179
[Cell phone rings]
Yeah, I thought about it,

53
00:02:57,247 --> 00:02:58,681
but after everything
that happened last year--

54
00:02:58,748 --> 00:03:00,382
- Nathan.
Yes, what is it?

55
00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:02,117
- [Sniffing]
- Hi, yeah, what's up?

56
00:03:02,185 --> 00:03:04,720
- What is that smell?
- What happened?

57
00:03:04,788 --> 00:03:07,223
[Sniffs] I smell nice.
I smell like a washing machine.

58
00:03:07,291 --> 00:03:09,192
No, it's not you, Gary.
Someone reeks of cologne.

59
00:03:09,259 --> 00:03:11,527
[Sniffs]

60
00:03:11,595 --> 00:03:14,563
Hicks!

61
00:03:14,631 --> 00:03:15,998
What are you doing?

62
00:03:16,066 --> 00:03:17,900
[Groans]
Harken.

63
00:03:17,968 --> 00:03:19,201
Hello, Rachel.

64
00:03:19,269 --> 00:03:21,504
Listen up, old spice,
I will hose you down.

65
00:03:21,572 --> 00:03:23,105
What are you talking about?
You know, that's not me.

66
00:03:23,173 --> 00:03:24,707
You've got perfect timing.
Meet John Bennett.

67
00:03:24,774 --> 00:03:27,443
This is Rosen's new choice
for our lead tactical.

68
00:03:27,511 --> 00:03:28,744
Rachel Pirzad.

69
00:03:28,812 --> 00:03:31,714
Rachel,
I've heard a lot about you.

70
00:03:33,550 --> 00:03:35,986
- What did you tell him?
- I didn't tell him anything.

71
00:03:36,053 --> 00:03:37,654
But if I did,
I would've told him

72
00:03:37,722 --> 00:03:39,623
all of the good stuff.

73
00:03:39,691 --> 00:03:42,527
So you're gonna
be working here now?

74
00:03:42,594 --> 00:03:44,896
Only on an as-needed basis,
but, yeah.

75
00:03:44,964 --> 00:03:48,934
Well, on an as-needed basis,

76
00:03:49,002 --> 00:03:52,304
you need to know that
your body spray or whatever

77
00:03:52,372 --> 00:03:54,073
is--

78
00:03:54,141 --> 00:03:55,408
it's way too distracting.

79
00:03:55,476 --> 00:03:57,911
It's not that you smell,
exactly, ju--

80
00:03:57,979 --> 00:03:59,679
Rachel, Bill.

81
00:03:59,747 --> 00:04:02,115
Hello, John.
Welcome.

82
00:04:02,183 --> 00:04:03,416
Thank you, sir.

83
00:04:03,484 --> 00:04:05,786
Cley just called.
An Alpha's been killed.

84
00:04:05,853 --> 00:04:07,120
We need you to go.

85
00:04:11,192 --> 00:04:14,328

Building Seven escapee.

87
00:04:16,197 --> 00:04:19,099
He can generate electricity
in his bare hands.

88
00:04:19,167 --> 00:04:20,234
[Electricity crackling]

89
00:04:20,302 --> 00:04:22,236
Those look
like chemical burns.

90
00:04:22,304 --> 00:04:23,671
There's an extremely
high concentration

91
00:04:23,739 --> 00:04:25,239
of hydrochloric acid.

92
00:04:25,307 --> 00:04:27,308
Did someone pour it on him?

93
00:04:27,376 --> 00:04:29,578
No, more like
spit it at him.

94
00:04:29,645 --> 00:04:32,748
The acid is mixed
with the attacker's saliva.

95
00:04:35,184 --> 00:04:37,352
So you can smell
this guy's spit?

96
00:04:37,419 --> 00:04:39,354
Hey, saliva has
a very distinctive smell.

97
00:04:39,422 --> 00:04:41,056
That's cool.
It's poison spit.

98
00:04:41,123 --> 00:04:42,524
- Yeah.
- It's like a cobra.

99
00:04:42,592 --> 00:04:44,092
I like that.
He didn't like it, though,

100
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:45,593
'cause it melted his--

101
00:04:45,661 --> 00:04:48,563
I-I'm being inappropriate.

There's some skin
under the nails.

104

He definitely put up a fight.

[Screams]

106
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:59,308
So we're saying
another Alpha killed him?

108
00:05:04,013 --> 00:05:05,513
Unh!

109
00:05:05,581 --> 00:05:07,615
Rachel, there's something
written on his hand.

110
00:05:07,683 --> 00:05:08,583
Can you take a look at that?

111
00:05:10,752 --> 00:05:12,353

that's a phone number.

- What kind of delivery?
- Didn't say.

122
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:34,041
No, Bill, there's
no "Crawford" in Bolivia.

123
00:05:34,109 --> 00:05:36,411
It's not even Spanish.

124
00:05:36,478 --> 00:05:38,479
There's--there's
a "Cristo" in Caracas.

125
00:05:38,547 --> 00:05:41,016
Bill, would you take point
on this, please?

126
00:05:41,083 --> 00:05:42,817
Maybe you can find someone

who knows what happened
to Mr. Duffy.

128
00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:46,053
- That's what I do.
- Good.

for Parish.

132
00:05:59,734 --> 00:06:02,169
this definitely
isn't Bolivia.

and cheering.

136
00:06:09,945 --> 00:06:11,879
Maybe squatters.

that acid?

139
00:06:16,851 --> 00:06:19,286
It's hard to tell.
Um, I need to get a closer look.

No, no, no.
Area's not secure.

I'm gonna go check it out.

Well,
from the looks of things,

160
00:07:29,658 --> 00:07:33,862
this is probably where Duffy
got that blood on his knuckles,

161

is that you stink, okay?

355
00:16:09,787 --> 00:16:12,856
neurological impulses
throughout our brain.

356
00:16:12,923 --> 00:16:16,626
It controls all physical
and fine motor skills

357
00:16:16,694 --> 00:16:19,328
while also impacting
our thoughts,

358
00:16:19,396 --> 00:16:23,166
emotions,
and cognitive function.

359
00:16:23,233 --> 00:16:27,403
The spinal cord serves as
a telegraphic cable,

360
00:16:27,471 --> 00:16:31,041
sending various messages
throughout the body.

361
00:16:31,108 --> 00:16:33,043
The spine itself measures
approximately

362
00:16:33,110 --> 00:16:35,378
a quarter of an inch
in diameter,

363
00:16:35,446 --> 00:16:38,248
and varies in length
from person to person.

367
00:16:44,855 --> 00:16:46,189
'cause he'll mess
with your eyes.

368
00:16:46,257 --> 00:16:47,890
And then there's this
other guy, super flexible.

369
00:16:47,958 --> 00:16:49,392
You punch him,
pops right back,

370
00:16:49,460 --> 00:16:51,294
so you gotta drive him
into a corner.

371
00:16:51,362 --> 00:16:53,863
That way, he springs back
and forth against your fists.

372
00:16:53,931 --> 00:16:57,867
What about, um,
that guy that spits acid?

373

No, never have.

378
00:17:14,452 --> 00:17:16,019
Yeah, but you just can't
pick that up right away.

Ahh.
You're an Alpha.

381

So are we done chatting?

382
00:17:22,728 --> 00:17:24,562
We got a lot of work to do.

383
00:17:26,065 --> 00:17:28,266
Hi.

384
00:17:28,333 --> 00:17:30,434
Um...

385
00:17:30,502 --> 00:17:32,970
so I raided the soap aisle.

386
00:17:37,610 --> 00:17:39,110
I figured
while we're on stakeout,

387
00:17:39,178 --> 00:17:42,413
you should get to at least
choose how I smell...

388
00:17:42,481 --> 00:17:44,615
which really sounded
a whole lot better in my head.

389
00:17:44,683 --> 00:17:46,650
So you actually went
and bought all of these things?

390
00:17:46,718 --> 00:17:48,719
Yeah, I mean,
I thought about unscented,

391
00:17:48,787 --> 00:17:50,955
but I figure nothing's
really unscented to you.

392
00:17:51,023 --> 00:17:52,223
You're right!

393
00:17:52,291 --> 00:17:55,427
There is no such thing
as unscented to me.

394
00:17:55,494 --> 00:17:57,996

You're welcome.

398

Is that it?

399
00:18:16,583 --> 00:18:19,218
I'm not gonna amp up
just for practice.

400
00:18:19,285 --> 00:18:20,686
It's not healthy for me.

401
00:18:20,754 --> 00:18:23,155
Well, my bet...
is using your ability

402
00:18:23,223 --> 00:18:24,590
is not your problem.

403

It's holding back.

404

all the time that's building up.

to see that, no.

00:25:04,897 --> 00:25:08,299
Don't you tell me
you support him in this.

531
00:25:08,366 --> 00:25:10,334
I think we both
need to support Gary

532
00:25:10,402 --> 00:25:12,669
in whatever steps
he needs to take

533
00:25:12,737 --> 00:25:16,406
towards his independence.

534
00:25:16,474 --> 00:25:18,208
But this is too big a step.

535
00:25:23,815 --> 00:25:26,283
For him or for you?

536
00:25:35,626 --> 00:25:38,862
Yeah, let me get a turkey dog
with everything.

537
00:25:38,929 --> 00:25:39,996
Coming up.
And for you?

538
00:25:40,064 --> 00:25:41,431
What do you want?

539
00:25:41,499 --> 00:25:43,599
Uh, what do
they taste like?

540
00:25:43,667 --> 00:25:45,602
They taste like hot dogs.

541
00:25:45,669 --> 00:25:47,571
What, you've never had
a hot dog before?

542
00:25:47,638 --> 00:25:49,406
Must have, right?

543
00:25:49,473 --> 00:25:51,341
Um, yeah, I'll just have
the same thing.

544
00:25:51,409 --> 00:25:52,576
All right,
give me two, please.

545
00:25:52,644 --> 00:25:55,012
Thanks.
Thanks.

546
00:25:55,079 --> 00:25:57,181
- So you coming tonight?
- Hell, yeah.

547
00:25:57,248 --> 00:25:59,450
There's gonna be
a boatload of people there

548
00:25:59,518 --> 00:26:00,885
with deep pockets,

549
00:26:00,953 --> 00:26:03,421
so you got to crush everyone
so we can rake it.

550
00:26:03,489 --> 00:26:07,158
Yeah, you need
some of this here.

551
00:26:07,226 --> 00:26:09,027
Some peppers and...

552
00:26:09,095 --> 00:26:12,598
so what about, uh, Bazevich?
Think he'll be there?

553
00:26:12,665 --> 00:26:15,934
You have, like, a man-crush
on him or something?

554
00:26:16,002 --> 00:26:17,169
How should I know
if he's coming?

555
00:26:17,237 --> 00:26:18,604
What do you mean
how should you know?

556
00:26:18,672 --> 00:26:20,573
I thought you knew everything
about these fights.

557
00:26:20,641 --> 00:26:22,141
How did you get involved
with them anyway?

558
00:26:22,209 --> 00:26:24,577
Just kind of
found myself there.

559
00:26:24,645 --> 00:26:27,346
These are amazing.
This is good.

560
00:26:27,414 --> 00:26:28,414
- You like that?
- Yeah.

561
00:26:28,482 --> 00:26:30,182
That's good stuff.

562
00:26:30,250 --> 00:26:34,187
What do you mean
you just found yourself there?

563
00:26:34,255 --> 00:26:38,791
I. I have this thing
where I can't remember

564
00:26:38,859 --> 00:26:43,296
anything that happened, like,
more than a month ago.

565
00:26:43,364 --> 00:26:44,664
Like, a month from now,

566
00:26:44,732 --> 00:26:49,203
I won't remember this
or you or the hot dog.

567
00:26:49,271 --> 00:26:51,372
- You serious?
- Mm-hmm.

568
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:53,975
My brain's wired to,
like, make room

569
00:26:54,043 --> 00:26:55,910
for all the new crap
I learn, you know?

570
00:26:55,978 --> 00:26:58,613
Yeah, but what about
your family, your home?

571
00:26:58,681 --> 00:27:01,216
Home's the fights for now.

572
00:27:01,284 --> 00:27:04,720
You got to be careful.
That's a rough crowd.

573
00:27:04,787 --> 00:27:07,489
Don't get all "Papa bear"
on me, okay?

574
00:27:07,557 --> 00:27:11,059
I've been taking care
of myself for...

575
00:27:11,127 --> 00:27:13,729
Well, I can't remember,
but it--it's been a long time.

576
00:27:13,796 --> 00:27:15,997
It's got to be lonely,
though.

577
00:27:21,938 --> 00:27:23,838
It's stupid, though.

578
00:27:23,906 --> 00:27:25,807
I don't know
why libraries do this.

579
00:27:25,875 --> 00:27:28,777
Dr. Rosen, it's just
a big waste of space.

580
00:27:28,845 --> 00:27:31,246
They could fit everything
in here just on one microchip.

581
00:27:31,314 --> 00:27:32,648
Inside voice, please, Gary.

582
00:27:32,715 --> 00:27:34,216
What?

583
00:27:34,284 --> 00:27:35,851
Inside voice, please.

584
00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:40,088
My inside voice
is too quiet.

585
00:27:40,156 --> 00:27:44,559
Well, split the difference,
then, huh?

586
00:27:44,627 --> 00:27:47,162
Oh, we are fortunate
this university

587
00:27:47,230 --> 00:27:50,231
preserved its newspapers.

588
00:27:50,299 --> 00:27:52,100
[Door closes]

589
00:27:56,405 --> 00:27:58,239
[Sighs]

590
00:28:02,811 --> 00:28:06,446
Jacob.
This is a surprise.

591
00:28:06,514 --> 00:28:10,583
You're making
a presentation tonight.

592
00:28:10,651 --> 00:28:13,453
Your abilities
are extraordinary.

593
00:28:15,189 --> 00:28:18,091
Cancel your presentation,
Zac.

594
00:28:18,159 --> 00:28:20,894
Promise to never speak
of what I can do.

595
00:28:20,961 --> 00:28:22,863
I can't, Jacob.

596
00:28:22,930 --> 00:28:25,632
It's too important
to keep to ourselves.

597
00:28:27,968 --> 00:28:30,570
[Gasps]

598
00:28:30,638 --> 00:28:33,640
[Gasping and choking]

599
00:28:42,651 --> 00:28:45,519
This crowd is hot tonight.

600
00:28:45,587 --> 00:28:47,354
Well, Rocky, try and remember
why we're here.

601
00:28:47,422 --> 00:28:48,689
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

602
00:28:48,757 --> 00:28:50,324
You see Kat anywhere?

603
00:28:50,392 --> 00:28:51,859
Don't worry about that kid.
She can take care of herself.

604
00:28:51,927 --> 00:28:53,227
No, look, she can't take care
of herself.

605
00:28:53,295 --> 00:28:55,229
She forgets things.
She could be lost or confused.

606
00:28:55,297 --> 00:28:57,298
I think she's gonna be okay.
Just stay focused.

607
00:28:57,366 --> 00:28:58,499
All right, all right,
all right.

608
00:28:58,567 --> 00:28:59,734
Let's go, let's go,
let's go.

609
00:28:59,801 --> 00:29:01,703
Who is gonna start the show?

610
00:29:01,770 --> 00:29:03,071
I will.

611
00:29:03,138 --> 00:29:05,573
No, no, no, no, no, man.
We need a real fighter.

612
00:29:05,641 --> 00:29:08,176
Bring it on.

613
00:29:08,244 --> 00:29:10,245
All right, all right,
we got some fresh meat.

614
00:29:10,312 --> 00:29:12,514
Now, who is gonna
be the challenger?

615
00:29:12,582 --> 00:29:14,449
Rubberman!

616
00:29:14,517 --> 00:29:17,252
[Crowd shouting]

617
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:20,522
[Laughs]

618
00:29:20,590 --> 00:29:22,825
I'm gonna remember
to send you some flowers.

619
00:29:22,893 --> 00:29:24,994
All right, ladies and gentlemen,
you know what time it is.

620
00:29:25,062 --> 00:29:26,762
Time to place your bets!

621
00:29:35,607 --> 00:29:38,242
There's nothing to control.

622
00:29:38,309 --> 00:29:40,511
You don't have
to reach for it,

623
00:29:40,579 --> 00:29:42,914
'cause it's part of you.

624
00:29:42,981 --> 00:29:45,349
When you want it,
it'll be there.

625
00:29:45,417 --> 00:29:47,885
[Crowd shouting]

626
00:29:53,425 --> 00:29:56,226
[Cheering]

627
00:30:04,869 --> 00:30:07,637
Unit one still clear.

628
00:30:07,705 --> 00:30:11,174
So your dad and both sisters
are in the military.

629
00:30:11,242 --> 00:30:12,375
Your brother's a cop.

630
00:30:12,443 --> 00:30:13,943
You must have felt
a lot of pressure

631
00:30:14,011 --> 00:30:17,546
to make certain choices
about your life, huh?

632
00:30:17,614 --> 00:30:20,882
- Sounds like you can relate.
- [Chuckles]

633
00:30:20,950 --> 00:30:22,852
I smell something.

634
00:30:22,919 --> 00:30:23,953
Seriously?
I mean, I--

635
00:30:24,020 --> 00:30:24,920
No.

636
00:30:28,625 --> 00:30:29,825
That S.U.V.

637
00:30:29,893 --> 00:30:31,927
He's not in there now,
but Bazevich--

638
00:30:31,995 --> 00:30:33,429
he was definitely in there.

639
00:30:33,497 --> 00:30:35,631
All right, all right,
all right.

640
00:30:35,699 --> 00:30:37,600
Who's next?
[Laughs]

641
00:30:39,169 --> 00:30:41,237
I am.

642
00:30:41,305 --> 00:30:43,339
[Crowd oohing]

643
00:30:43,407 --> 00:30:45,041
Nah, nah, nah, nah,
nah, nah, nah.

644
00:30:45,109 --> 00:30:47,043
Surprise.

645
00:30:48,427 --> 00:30:49,526
You trying to play me, Kat?

646
00:30:49,594 --> 00:30:51,061
I never said
I wasn't a fighter.

647
00:30:51,129 --> 00:30:53,402
There is gonna be
some action tonight!

648
00:30:53,502 --> 00:30:54,836
Place your bets!
Right now!

649
00:30:54,903 --> 00:30:56,504
Kat, this isn't
a good idea.

650
00:30:56,571 --> 00:31:00,107
Harken,
this isn't personal.

651
00:31:00,175 --> 00:31:01,475
All right, all right.
What you waiting for?

652
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:09,115
In battle, a warrior
who remains calm

653
00:31:09,183 --> 00:31:11,117
and remembers their training

654
00:31:11,185 --> 00:31:15,054
will always vanquish a foe
who does not.

655
00:31:18,826 --> 00:31:21,628
Shift your opponent's weight
to one leg

656
00:31:21,696 --> 00:31:23,663
and attack
the weighted knee.

657
00:31:28,703 --> 00:31:30,070
If you lack size,

658
00:31:30,138 --> 00:31:32,640
compensate with speed
and precision.

659
00:31:40,482 --> 00:31:43,484
The brain
is the most sensitive organ

660
00:31:43,552 --> 00:31:45,720
in the human body.

661
00:31:47,290 --> 00:31:53,062
[Crowd shouting, cheering]

662
00:31:53,130 --> 00:31:54,997
Aah!

663
00:31:58,836 --> 00:32:00,770
[Cheering]

664
00:32:01,973 --> 00:32:05,376
Hey.
Hey, you all right?

665
00:32:05,443 --> 00:32:06,677
Is he okay?

666
00:32:06,745 --> 00:32:08,545
He's awesome.
Yeah, thanks.

667
00:32:08,613 --> 00:32:09,847
Hey, Harken.

668
00:32:09,915 --> 00:32:11,248
Harken.

669
00:32:11,316 --> 00:32:12,249
Come on.

670
00:32:12,317 --> 00:32:13,584
Not bad.

671
00:32:13,652 --> 00:32:17,787
Some people want to talk
to you about a job.

672
00:32:17,855 --> 00:32:20,256
- What kind of a job?
- Well, I don't know.

673
00:32:20,324 --> 00:32:23,126
They didn't say,
but I know they pay big.

674
00:32:23,193 --> 00:32:26,862
Hear 'em out.
Let 'em buy you a drink.

675
00:32:26,930 --> 00:32:30,099
Okay.

676
00:32:30,166 --> 00:32:32,634
You all right?

677
00:32:36,973 --> 00:32:39,074
Oh, that's that girl Kat
from the other night.

678
00:32:43,413 --> 00:32:45,481
Bill! Hicks!
Come on!

679
00:32:49,753 --> 00:32:50,720
What happened?

680
00:32:50,788 --> 00:32:52,054
You okay?

681
00:32:52,122 --> 00:32:53,322
- [Sighs]
- Ask him who did it.

682
00:32:53,390 --> 00:32:54,991
[Groans]
Hicks, I will kill you.

683
00:32:55,059 --> 00:32:57,027
Hey, listen,
we got a lead on Bazevich.

684
00:32:57,094 --> 00:32:58,495
He was in that car.
[Engine turns over]

685
00:32:58,562 --> 00:32:59,829
Oh, and your friend Kat
just got in there.

686
00:32:59,897 --> 00:33:01,297
All right, let's go.
Come on.

687
00:33:01,365 --> 00:33:03,299
[Tires squeal]

688
00:33:08,872 --> 00:33:12,141
That's their S.U.V.

689
00:33:12,209 --> 00:33:14,644
What the hell is this place?

690
00:33:14,712 --> 00:33:17,448
Okay, Bazevich is inside.

691
00:33:17,515 --> 00:33:19,716
You can smell him?

692
00:33:19,784 --> 00:33:21,385
Believe me,
he's unforgettable.

693
00:33:21,453 --> 00:33:22,854
Rachel,
what's going on in there?

694
00:33:22,921 --> 00:33:26,091
There's, uh...
[Heartbeats in distance]

695
00:33:26,158 --> 00:33:27,692
There's multiple heartbeats.

696
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:33,031
An EKG, respirators,
hospital machines?

697
00:33:33,099 --> 00:33:35,868
The place is wired
with sensor alarms.

698
00:33:35,935 --> 00:33:38,370
I hear weaponry...
[Guns clack]

699
00:33:38,438 --> 00:33:41,406
And heavy boots.

700
00:33:41,474 --> 00:33:43,508
Unit One to tactical,
send backup to our position.

701
00:33:43,576 --> 00:33:45,510
Wait.
It's that girl Kat.

702
00:33:45,578 --> 00:33:50,215
No! Let me go!

703
00:33:50,283 --> 00:33:52,918
Her voice is weak.
She's fading.

704
00:33:52,985 --> 00:33:56,555
A male voice now.
"Make sure she stays under."

705

I wasn't undercover.

You were
definitely undercover.

with those guys.

uh, in the village,

next to my favorite restaurant,

781
00:37:50,990 --> 00:37:54,324

very easy for me, Stanton.

794
00:38:57,995 --> 00:39:00,530
Or do you prefer Major Dunham?

795
00:39:00,598 --> 00:39:03,066
I prefer Stanton.

796
00:39:03,134 --> 00:39:06,203
Well, thank you for providing
Dr. Harrison's research.

797
00:39:06,270 --> 00:39:08,739
So you'd know how I began.

798
00:39:08,806 --> 00:39:11,241
Yes.
By murdering a friend.

799
00:39:13,311 --> 00:39:17,648
Dr. Harrison
wanted to use me.

800
00:39:17,716 --> 00:39:21,318
So you scarified
an innocent man.

801
00:39:21,385 --> 00:39:24,321
Have you ever sacrificed
an innocent man?

802
00:39:24,389 --> 00:39:26,022
Not intentionally.

803

his own destiny.

of a grateful nation?

No.

810
00:39:44,409 --> 00:39:49,013

of my unique perspective.

one of my favorite subjects

825
00:40:32,425 --> 00:40:34,925

was cellular research...

826
00:40:34,993 --> 00:40:36,260

It was very tedious,
but, um...

It was exciting,
because eventually...

832
