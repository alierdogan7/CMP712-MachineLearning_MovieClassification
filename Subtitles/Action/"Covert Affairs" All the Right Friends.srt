00:09:04,379 --> 00:09:05,712
- It's protocol.
- Protocol?

179
00:09:05,780 --> 00:09:07,414
Yeah, which already saved
your life once.

180
00:09:07,482 --> 00:09:09,483
Uh-huh, yeah,
I realize your boss requires

181
00:09:09,551 --> 00:09:11,852
a blind allegiance
and slavish devotion, okay?

182
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:13,421
We don't have time for this.

183
00:09:13,488 --> 00:09:15,456
But I know for a fact
that your agency's in league

184
00:09:15,524 --> 00:09:16,991
with the people
who are trying to kill me.

185
00:09:17,059 --> 00:09:18,292
You understand?
You're like a dog with a bone.

186
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:19,960
And I know
that I'm absolutely right.

187
00:09:20,028 --> 00:09:21,829
- You're not right.
- Absolutely.

188
00:09:21,897 --> 00:09:23,196
Not this time.

189
00:09:23,264 --> 00:09:24,431
Now, please.

190
00:09:24,499 --> 00:09:25,933
To where?

191
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,736
I'm gonna take you to
a safe location in Buenos Aires.

192
00:09:28,804 --> 00:09:30,270
- Oh, okay.
- Once there, I check in.

193
00:09:30,338 --> 00:09:32,406
If everything's okay, I'll take
you to the Italian embassy.

194
00:09:32,473 --> 00:09:34,174
Hey, hey, no.

195
00:09:34,241 --> 00:09:35,975
- Yes.
- Ah!

196
00:09:36,043 --> 00:09:39,280
[Speaking Italian]

197
00:09:39,348 --> 00:09:40,948
Nightmare.
Don't worry.

198
00:09:41,016 --> 00:09:42,683
By tonight, you'll be home
safe in Italy,

199
00:09:42,751 --> 00:09:44,118
and all this will be over.

200
00:09:44,186 --> 00:09:46,121
[Grunts]

201
00:09:46,189 --> 00:09:48,824
I don't know how people
like you sleep at night.

202
00:09:48,892 --> 00:09:52,028
I know you felt
you owed me, sir,

203
00:09:52,096 --> 00:09:54,698
but a promotion?

204
00:09:54,766 --> 00:09:57,802
This would be a substantial
change in your life--

205
00:09:57,869 --> 00:10:00,471
a staff, your own office
on the seventh floor.

206
00:10:00,538 --> 00:10:03,874
Whoa. A view.

207
00:10:03,942 --> 00:10:07,078
A bump in grade means
a bump in pay--

208
00:10:07,146 --> 00:10:08,681
a significant one.

209
00:10:08,748 --> 00:10:10,683
Next, you're gonna offer me
a new parking space.

210
00:10:10,751 --> 00:10:12,118
[Chuckles]

211
00:10:12,186 --> 00:10:15,455
- [Chuckles]
- Two spaces down from mine.

212
00:10:15,523 --> 00:10:17,089
Two spaces south
is the D.D.I.

213
00:10:17,157 --> 00:10:19,559
He's not going anywhere.

214
00:10:19,626 --> 00:10:22,895
Two spaces north...

215
00:10:22,963 --> 00:10:24,964
Office
of Congressional Affairs?

216
00:10:25,032 --> 00:10:27,566
We think you'd be perfect.

217
00:10:27,634 --> 00:10:29,034
You want me in O.C.A.?

218
00:10:29,102 --> 00:10:31,304
We want you to run O.C.A.

219
00:10:31,372 --> 00:10:32,906
Charlie's going green badge.

220
00:10:32,973 --> 00:10:36,609
He's got kids
to put through college.

221
00:10:36,677 --> 00:10:41,481
Plus, it's time for newer blood,
younger blood.

222
00:10:41,549 --> 00:10:42,783
Well, that would mean--

223
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:45,352
Yes, Auggie.

224
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:48,589
You'd be overt.

225
00:10:48,656 --> 00:10:51,258
I could never go
in the field again.

226
00:10:51,326 --> 00:10:52,659
Yeah, that's right.

227
00:10:52,727 --> 00:10:57,431
Once you step in front
of the cameras, it's--

228
00:10:57,499 --> 00:11:00,835
I remember when I did it.

229
00:11:00,902 --> 00:11:03,070
It was a big step.

230
00:11:03,138 --> 00:11:06,073
You'd be one of three
public faces for the CIA--

231
00:11:06,141 --> 00:11:09,143
the D.C.I., me, and you.

232
00:11:09,211 --> 00:11:11,846
[Chuckles]

233
00:11:11,914 --> 00:11:14,282
Here I thought
I was in trouble.

234
00:11:14,349 --> 00:11:15,917
Oh, this is a hell
of an opportunity--

235
00:11:15,984 --> 00:11:17,585
a career maker.

236
00:11:17,653 --> 00:11:21,023
And honestly...

237
00:11:21,090 --> 00:11:23,157
We're not exactly pulling you
from the field.

238
00:11:23,225 --> 00:11:26,861
The D.C.I. and I agree.

239
00:11:26,929 --> 00:11:29,297
We both think you are
the right man for the job.

240
00:11:34,470 --> 00:11:35,570
I'm speechless.

241
00:11:35,638 --> 00:11:37,705
Well, you'd have
to work on that.

242
00:11:37,773 --> 00:11:40,542
You can't be speechless
on this job.

243
00:11:40,610 --> 00:11:43,879
- When?
- You'd start next week.

244
00:11:43,947 --> 00:11:46,315
So you need to give it
some serious thought.

245
00:12:07,239 --> 00:12:10,342
Carlo Reni was arrested
by the FBI two days ago

246
00:12:10,409 --> 00:12:12,611
for reading the trash
at the Bureau of Land Management

247
00:12:12,679 --> 00:12:14,112
here in D.C.

248
00:12:14,180 --> 00:12:15,581
He said he was investigating
a story for--

249
00:12:15,648 --> 00:12:16,815
I know.
I know.

250
00:12:16,883 --> 00:12:18,150
He stuck to his cover.
I know this.

251
00:12:18,218 --> 00:12:19,351
Tell me what I don't know.

252
00:12:19,419 --> 00:12:21,587
The FBI had him
all of five hours

253
00:12:21,655 --> 00:12:23,890
before the Italian A.I.S.E.
offered up a trade.

254
00:12:23,957 --> 00:12:25,825
Did you know that?
No.

255
00:12:25,893 --> 00:12:27,961
Which means, of course--

256
00:12:28,029 --> 00:12:29,796
His own agency
blew his cover.

257
00:12:29,863 --> 00:12:32,498
- He knows something.
- What?

258
00:12:32,566 --> 00:12:35,101
He said he was only
in the country for five days

259
00:12:35,168 --> 00:12:36,468
before he was arrested.

260
00:12:36,536 --> 00:12:39,004
- Where was he before that?
- A lot of traveling--

261
00:12:39,072 --> 00:12:41,373
mostly South America,
working his cover.

262
00:12:41,441 --> 00:12:43,308
Before that,
some Middle East visits.

263
00:12:43,376 --> 00:12:45,911
He was kicked out of Iran
for publishing articles

264
00:12:45,978 --> 00:12:49,580
"Libelous and unfavorable
to the government."

265
00:12:49,648 --> 00:12:51,082
What does Persia House say?

266
00:12:51,150 --> 00:12:53,684
That he was kicked out
for his story, ostensibly.

267
00:12:53,752 --> 00:12:54,985
They have him on a watch list.

268
00:12:55,053 --> 00:12:59,890
Get Genaro.
I want a face-to-face.

269
00:12:59,957 --> 00:13:01,491
Auggie.
Joan.

270
00:13:01,559 --> 00:13:03,193
Good meeting?

271
00:13:03,261 --> 00:13:05,029
Interesting meeting.

272
00:13:05,096 --> 00:13:07,531
What can I do?

273
00:13:07,599 --> 00:13:09,767
I want confirmation that
there is a jet on the ground

274
00:13:09,835 --> 00:13:11,269
in the Falklands.

275
00:13:11,337 --> 00:13:13,104
I want to know whether or not
we're being played.

276
00:13:13,172 --> 00:13:14,506
I can do that.

277
00:13:14,573 --> 00:13:17,876
And someone please find out
who the opposition is.

278
00:13:17,943 --> 00:13:19,310
If we have a hitter
in the field,

279
00:13:19,378 --> 00:13:20,445
I want to know who it is.

280
00:13:25,083 --> 00:13:27,151
[Cows mooing]

281
00:13:34,659 --> 00:13:36,626
And this is probably
where you steal

282
00:13:36,694 --> 00:13:39,195
some hapless peasant's vehicle,

283
00:13:39,263 --> 00:13:40,763
his only worldly possession--
typical.

284
00:13:40,831 --> 00:13:44,067
Actually, this is where
I buy it.

285
00:13:44,135 --> 00:13:46,469
<i>Buenos dias!</i>

286
00:13:52,409 --> 00:13:56,145
But you would have
stolen it.

287
00:13:56,212 --> 00:13:57,913
Let me drive.
I know the way.

288
00:14:01,084 --> 00:14:02,884
In Italy,
a woman never drives.

289
00:14:02,952 --> 00:14:04,720
The man drives.

290
00:14:04,788 --> 00:14:07,656
We're not in Italy.

291
00:14:07,723 --> 00:14:09,291
Fine.

292
00:14:09,359 --> 00:14:12,961
Get us lost.
We're not lost.

293
00:14:13,028 --> 00:14:15,263
It's only a matter of time.

294
00:14:24,172 --> 00:14:25,339
Auggie?

295
00:14:25,407 --> 00:14:27,675
Got a signal, I think,

296
00:14:27,742 --> 00:14:30,210
at least that's
what N.G.A. tells me,

297
00:14:30,278 --> 00:14:32,312
but they might be playing
with me.

298
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:34,848
Officially,
it's in customs' hold.

299
00:14:34,915 --> 00:14:37,017
Passengers and crew
are still aboard.

300
00:14:37,085 --> 00:14:38,652
Can we get eyes
on the ground?

301
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:39,987
Working on it.

302
00:14:40,055 --> 00:14:41,489
What about Genaro
at the Italian embassy?

303
00:14:41,557 --> 00:14:43,024
I'm making arrangements.

304
00:14:43,091 --> 00:14:44,626
Word is, he'd like
to speak with you, too.

305
00:14:44,693 --> 00:14:46,027
Good.

306
00:14:46,095 --> 00:14:48,797
- Anything on our hitter?
- One possible--

307
00:14:48,865 --> 00:14:50,666
a Helmut Drum.

308
00:14:50,734 --> 00:14:52,869
He arrived in Buenos Aires

309
00:14:52,936 --> 00:14:55,838
on a flight from London
yesterday morning--

310
00:14:55,906 --> 00:14:57,840
former Chechen separatist,

311
00:14:57,907 --> 00:15:00,109
noted involvement
in death squads,

312
00:15:00,177 --> 00:15:02,912
ties to the usual
unsavory suspects,

313
00:15:02,979 --> 00:15:04,813
mostly Eastern Europe.

314
00:15:04,881 --> 00:15:07,348
It's believed
he's independent.

315
00:15:07,416 --> 00:15:09,250
European ties,
anglo appearance

316
00:15:09,318 --> 00:15:10,818
makes him a good commodity
in certain markets.

317
00:15:10,886 --> 00:15:12,620
Now he's in Argentina.

318
00:15:12,688 --> 00:15:14,655
He fits Annie's description.

319
00:15:14,723 --> 00:15:18,093
I profiled this guy
for the U.K. desk.

320
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:19,394
He is not
a true believer anymore.

321
00:15:19,462 --> 00:15:20,896
He is all about the money.

322
00:15:20,963 --> 00:15:23,699
He's the real deal.
Let's give Annie a heads-up.

323
00:15:23,767 --> 00:15:25,501
Already tried.
Can't reach her.

324
00:15:25,569 --> 00:15:27,370
- Try again.
- Yep.

325
00:15:44,077 --> 00:15:47,846
[Engine sputtering]

326
00:15:57,924 --> 00:16:00,158
This wouldn't happen
if you let me drive.

327
00:16:16,136 --> 00:16:18,370
I would kill for a macchiato.

328
00:16:18,438 --> 00:16:20,840
Speaking of which...

329
00:16:20,907 --> 00:16:23,008
Any idea who wants you dead?

330
00:16:23,076 --> 00:16:25,478
- Now you want to know?
- Might be helpful.

331
00:16:25,545 --> 00:16:29,481
People in your line of work,
maybe people you know.

332
00:16:29,549 --> 00:16:32,685
I don't know people
like that.

333
00:16:32,752 --> 00:16:34,153
And I don't work
with people like that.

334
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:36,588
You keep saying
you're not a spy,

335
00:16:36,656 --> 00:16:39,724
and yet consider
the circumstances.

336
00:16:39,792 --> 00:16:41,793
I admit to making
certain parties unhappy.

337
00:16:41,861 --> 00:16:44,095
It's the nature of my work.

338
00:16:44,163 --> 00:16:45,930
The only thing we have
in common--

339
00:16:45,998 --> 00:16:48,300
I'm not the one
with an assassin after him.

340
00:16:48,367 --> 00:16:51,270
The free press has its enemies
in your country and mine.

341
00:16:51,338 --> 00:16:52,872
I'll give you
one thing, Carlo.

342
00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:54,808
Whatever you are,
you talk a good game.

343
00:16:54,875 --> 00:16:57,044
I'll give you that.

344
00:16:57,111 --> 00:16:59,547
[Engine sputtering, turning]

345
00:16:59,614 --> 00:17:00,982
Alternator belt.

346
00:17:01,050 --> 00:17:03,251
It's not pretty,
but it'll hold.

347
00:17:03,318 --> 00:17:07,221
Another thing I'm not--
mechanical.

348
00:17:07,289 --> 00:17:08,823
If I found you a macchiato,

349
00:17:08,890 --> 00:17:10,391
you think
that might jog your memory

350
00:17:10,459 --> 00:17:12,793
about who's after us?

351
00:17:15,163 --> 00:17:16,663
Maybe.

352
00:17:16,731 --> 00:17:20,166
[Chuckles]

353
00:17:20,234 --> 00:17:22,502
But no caramel

00:27:26,559 --> 00:27:29,360
Tell me who's trying
to kill you.

535
00:27:29,428 --> 00:27:30,428
[Sighs]

536
00:27:30,496 --> 00:27:31,863
Well--

537
00:27:31,931 --> 00:27:33,298
Unless a woman
shouldn't know these things.

538
00:27:33,366 --> 00:27:34,866
Look, I mean--

539
00:27:34,934 --> 00:27:38,837
I think it's about a story
I've been working on...

540
00:27:38,905 --> 00:27:40,339
about the O.C.U.

541
00:27:40,406 --> 00:27:41,640
The Italian
oil conglomerate?

542
00:27:41,708 --> 00:27:43,275
Yes, exactly,
and the Italian government.

543
00:27:43,343 --> 00:27:44,777
It's a conspiracy?

544
00:27:44,845 --> 00:27:47,380
My sources are connected
to certain government officials.

545
00:27:47,448 --> 00:27:50,216
It's about the oil rigs
here in South America.

546
00:27:50,284 --> 00:27:52,252
I want to get you
to a safe house.

547
00:27:55,223 --> 00:27:59,661
[Crowd cheering]

548
00:27:59,728 --> 00:28:01,062
They say,
"Follow the money."

549
00:28:01,130 --> 00:28:05,600
Well, I followed the money,
and here I am.

550
00:28:05,668 --> 00:28:07,669
They know I'm close
to publishing.

551
00:28:07,737 --> 00:28:09,137
I have corroboration--

552
00:28:09,205 --> 00:28:10,805
how they bribed
and extorted

553
00:28:10,873 --> 00:28:12,773
to get their share
of the San Jorge oil fields.

554
00:28:12,841 --> 00:28:16,043
They want to stop me.
They need to stop me.

555
00:28:16,111 --> 00:28:18,145
I am not a spy.

556
00:28:18,212 --> 00:28:19,679
I'm a writer.

557
00:28:19,747 --> 00:28:21,581
I've been working
on this story for two years.

558
00:28:21,649 --> 00:28:23,917
Someone wants me
back in Italy to--

559
00:28:23,985 --> 00:28:26,820
to stop me from publishing.

560
00:28:26,888 --> 00:28:29,023
The Italian embassy
may not be the place to go.

561
00:28:29,091 --> 00:28:30,424
Finally.

562
00:28:30,492 --> 00:28:31,926
But we can't go
to the U.S. embassy either.

563
00:28:31,994 --> 00:28:33,328
- Why?
- It's complicated.

564
00:28:33,396 --> 00:28:35,997
[Cell phone rings]

565
00:28:36,065 --> 00:28:37,733
Yeah?
Where are you?

566
00:28:37,801 --> 00:28:39,435
- We're in the city.
- You are not safe.

567
00:28:39,502 --> 00:28:41,270
The local authorities
have your descriptions.

568
00:28:41,338 --> 00:28:42,572
Not surprising.

569
00:28:42,639 --> 00:28:44,340
We're working
on an extraction.

570
00:28:44,408 --> 00:28:46,375
You are not to go
to the Italian embassy.

571
00:28:46,443 --> 00:28:47,677
Understood?
Yeah.

572
00:28:47,745 --> 00:28:49,178
I-I already figured that out.

573
00:28:49,246 --> 00:28:51,013
Are either of you injured?

574
00:28:51,081 --> 00:28:52,549
No, we're good.

575
00:28:52,616 --> 00:28:55,451
The package may not be
what we thought it was.

576
00:28:55,519 --> 00:28:57,787
Well, I don't think anyone
is who we think they are.

577
00:28:57,855 --> 00:29:00,222
Either way, your safety
is what's important.

578
00:29:00,290 --> 00:29:01,824
Auggie's working
on a possible exit.

579
00:29:01,892 --> 00:29:03,493
"Possible"?

580
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:05,995
Highly probable, though still
in the formative stages.

581
00:29:06,062 --> 00:29:07,396
I need you to get

582
00:29:07,464 --> 00:29:10,032
to the U.S. President's
Line terminal at the wharf.

583
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:11,801
U.S. President's line

584
00:29:11,868 --> 00:29:13,402
at Buenos Aires
or La Cotta?

585
00:29:13,470 --> 00:29:15,304
Buenos Aires, berth 28.

586
00:29:15,372 --> 00:29:17,206
I'll have more information
when you get there.

587
00:29:17,273 --> 00:29:19,008
Just get there and be safe.

588
00:29:19,076 --> 00:29:21,277
And there's another detail
you need to be aware of.

589
00:29:21,345 --> 00:29:22,712
Annie, we've discovered

590
00:29:22,780 --> 00:29:24,313
that two of Carlo's contacts
have turned up dead

591
00:29:24,381 --> 00:29:25,648
in the past 24 hours.

592
00:29:25,716 --> 00:29:27,616
Both were employed by O.C.U.

593
00:29:27,684 --> 00:29:29,585
He told me he's working
on a story about O.C.U.

594
00:29:29,653 --> 00:29:32,621
Their names are Rinaldo
and Vasquez.

595
00:29:32,689 --> 00:29:34,723
Keep your head down.
Get to the wharf.

596
00:29:34,791 --> 00:29:37,526
We'll get you out.

597
00:29:37,593 --> 00:29:39,995
What?

598
00:29:40,062 --> 00:29:42,197
Rinaldo and Vasquez--
does that mean anything?

599
00:29:42,264 --> 00:29:44,199
Two of my sources.
Why?

600
00:29:44,266 --> 00:29:46,901
They're dead.

601
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:52,707
We have to get to the wharf.

602
00:29:52,775 --> 00:29:54,609
My agency's gonna try
and get us out of here.

603
00:29:54,677 --> 00:29:57,545
But, but--

604
00:29:57,613 --> 00:29:59,580
Carlo.

605
00:29:59,648 --> 00:30:01,850
Carlo, I'm sorry.

606
00:30:01,917 --> 00:30:03,919
I know this is hard,
but we have to move.

607
00:30:03,987 --> 00:30:05,554
I'm responsible.

608
00:30:05,621 --> 00:30:07,456
They put their faith in me,
and now they're dead.

609
00:30:07,523 --> 00:30:09,191
The police
are looking for us.

610
00:30:09,258 --> 00:30:12,928
It'll all be for nothing if you
get caught and go to jail.

611
00:30:12,995 --> 00:30:15,497
We have to move, now.

612
00:30:17,834 --> 00:30:19,435
[Speaking spanish]

613
00:30:19,503 --> 00:30:21,170
Uh, oh...

614
00:30:41,692 --> 00:30:43,793
Sorry.

615
00:30:55,111 --> 00:30:57,946
[Crowd cheering]

616
00:31:21,637 --> 00:31:23,104
I need to talk
to the editor, please.

617
00:31:23,172 --> 00:31:25,507
<i>Claro que si.</i>

618
00:31:29,012 --> 00:31:30,680
Annie, how--
how did you know?

619
00:31:30,747 --> 00:31:32,348
Where else would
a writer go?

620
00:31:32,416 --> 00:31:33,716
A writer?

621
00:31:33,784 --> 00:31:35,551
Look, we are still
in danger,

622
00:31:35,619 --> 00:31:37,520
and I am still responsible
for you.

623
00:31:37,588 --> 00:31:40,056
- When did you decide that--
- We don't have time for this.

624
00:31:40,123 --> 00:31:41,524
We need to get
to the extraction point.

625
00:31:41,591 --> 00:31:44,359
I am glad. I really am,
but I have to do this.

626
00:31:44,427 --> 00:31:46,028
No, you need to trust me.

627
00:31:46,095 --> 00:31:48,996
I do trust you...
Mostly.

628
00:31:49,064 --> 00:31:51,232
But I trust this too.

629
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:54,101
Look, if I'm going
to get killed, Annie,

630
00:31:54,169 --> 00:31:56,570
which at this point
is fairly probable,

631
00:31:56,638 --> 00:31:59,407
then I have
to get my story out.

632
00:31:59,475 --> 00:32:00,808
I have to.

633
00:32:00,876 --> 00:32:04,078
I made promises, and I want
to keep those promises.

634
00:32:07,316 --> 00:32:08,983
How do you know
they'll print it?

635
00:32:09,051 --> 00:32:11,553
I don't.

636
00:32:11,620 --> 00:32:14,288
But it's not
the battles won, Annie.

637
00:32:14,356 --> 00:32:15,556
It's the battles waged.

638
00:32:15,624 --> 00:32:18,659
You can understand that...

639
00:32:18,727 --> 00:32:21,395
If you are
who I think you are.

640
00:32:24,399 --> 00:32:26,667
Make it quick.

641
00:32:43,451 --> 00:32:46,554
You think I have
an ulterior motive?

642
00:32:46,622 --> 00:32:49,424
Frankly, yes.

643
00:32:49,492 --> 00:32:50,759
We all have motives.

644
00:32:50,827 --> 00:32:53,062
We're told that in our training,
to expect it.

645
00:32:53,129 --> 00:32:55,365
You think mine are suspect
due to my circumstances?

646
00:32:55,432 --> 00:32:58,468
No, sir.
Due to my circumstances.

647
00:32:58,536 --> 00:32:59,869
Uh-huh.

648
00:32:59,937 --> 00:33:01,571
You're
in a public relations battle,

649
00:33:01,639 --> 00:33:03,540
and I'm the feel-good hit
of the summer.

650
00:33:03,607 --> 00:33:05,008
[Chuckles]
That's ballsy, Auggie.

651
00:33:05,075 --> 00:33:06,443
Good for you.

652
00:33:06,510 --> 00:33:08,779
I have my reasons, sure.

653
00:33:08,847 --> 00:33:10,780
And, yes, I am fighting
for my career.

654
00:33:10,848 --> 00:33:13,417
So what?
It's irrelevant.

655
00:33:13,484 --> 00:33:16,086
There's never a clean
game board, Auggie, never.

656
00:33:16,153 --> 00:33:18,221
Gets more complicated
the higher you climb.

657
00:33:18,289 --> 00:33:20,524
Up or down, yes or no.

658
00:33:20,591 --> 00:33:22,459
Your decision, your terms.

659
00:33:22,527 --> 00:33:26,030
To hell with me
or what I may or may not need.

660
00:33:26,098 --> 00:33:29,233
And I wouldn't worry about me
too much if I were you.

661
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:33,604
I still have a few teeth
in my head.

662
00:33:33,671 --> 00:33:35,739
Question--

663
00:33:35,807 --> 00:33:38,041
who would I answer to?

664
00:33:38,109 --> 00:33:40,176
The D.C.I. and me.

665
00:33:40,244 --> 00:33:43,479
And what about...Perks?

666
00:33:43,547 --> 00:33:45,881
What do you have in mind?

667
00:33:45,948 --> 00:33:48,550
Say I wanted an extraction
in a foreign country.

668
00:33:48,618 --> 00:33:50,251
[Laughs]

669
00:33:50,319 --> 00:33:54,288
I thought you were gonna ask
for a wet bar.

670
00:33:54,356 --> 00:33:56,691
[Carlo speaking spanish]

671
00:34:03,333 --> 00:34:05,601
His people are working
on the same story.

672
00:34:05,668 --> 00:34:07,436
He's got a reporter
in the San Jorge Gulf,

673
00:34:07,504 --> 00:34:08,938
and I also got a name.

674
00:34:09,006 --> 00:34:10,707
I know who visited me
when I was in custody.

675
00:34:10,775 --> 00:34:11,975
- Who?
- Genaro.

676
00:34:12,043 --> 00:34:14,511
Romano Genaro.
He's Italian intelligence.

677
00:34:14,579 --> 00:34:16,647
He gets a cut
on any oil extracted--

678
00:34:16,715 --> 00:34:18,282
potentially millions.

679
00:34:18,349 --> 00:34:21,018
I knew I was making someone
in the government unhappy,

680
00:34:21,085 --> 00:34:22,586
someone pulling strings.

681
00:34:22,654 --> 00:34:23,988
I didn't know until now.

682
00:34:24,056 --> 00:34:26,991
He's in for a big surprise.

683
00:34:43,577 --> 00:34:46,346
What's the best way
to the wharf?

684
00:34:50,051 --> 00:34:51,385
Genaro's our man.

685
00:34:51,452 --> 00:34:54,221
He's been assisting the Italian
oil conglomerate O.C.U.

686
00:34:54,289 --> 00:34:56,190
And coercing oil leases.

687
00:34:56,257 --> 00:34:58,692
Carlo Reni's investigations
were about to uncover that

688
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:00,026
and name names.

689
00:35:00,094 --> 00:35:01,427
That's why Genaro
was so anxious

690
00:35:01,495 --> 00:35:02,896
to keep this off
the official channels.

691
00:35:02,963 --> 00:35:05,231
So much
for professional courtesy.

692
00:35:05,299 --> 00:35:06,766
Reni is not a spy.

693
00:35:06,834 --> 00:35:09,535
But, Joan, this doesn't change
the facts on the ground.

694
00:35:09,603 --> 00:35:11,004
Jorge--

695
00:35:11,072 --> 00:35:12,739
Your operative crashed
through a police checkpoint

696
00:35:12,806 --> 00:35:15,141
and assaulted
a local policeman.

697
00:35:15,209 --> 00:35:16,609
I'm bringing her in.

698
00:35:16,677 --> 00:35:19,879
Do not threaten me.
This is my operative at risk.

699
00:35:19,947 --> 00:35:22,448

we're in, Joan.

700

somewhere...

We will have future business.

704
00:35:31,859 --> 00:35:34,761
Do not think for a minute
that your harming

705
00:35:34,829 --> 00:35:37,097
one of my people
will not have a deep impact

706
00:35:37,164 --> 00:35:39,700
on our relationship.

707

Annie,
what's he doing here?

708
00:36:19,976 --> 00:36:22,011
Someone at the newspaper
must have tipped him off.

709
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:26,849
