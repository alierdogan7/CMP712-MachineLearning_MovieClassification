It was great.
I had a wonderful time.

68

It was like, you know,
being in another country.

69

It was a different world,
another universe.

I feel very Zen. Very different.

Is he all right?

78
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:54,676
He's fine. I'm sure he's fine.

79

Thank you very much, Casper.

- You know, the ghost.
- Oh, right.

83
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:14,830
So how are you, then,
you big bloody man?

84
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:18,276
I'm good. I'm good. I've had
a few things to work through.

85
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:20,749
- With Sarah?
- No, with George Lucas.

(Daisy) Tim, it's been over a year.

88

It's been 18 months, Daisy.

89
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:39,678
And it still hurts.

90
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:42,228
I didn't think Phantom Menace
was that bad.

91
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:49,313
It's nice to see you, Mike.
What've you been up to?

92
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:51,391
I'm in the quarterfinals
of Robot Wars.

93
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:53,391
Wow!

94
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:55,914
But I've had to
move out of Mum's place.

95
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,037
- Really?
- Things have been a bit... difficult.

96
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:02,112
She's been very overbearing
and I felt suffocated.

97
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:04,156
I've got a lot to offer the world,

98
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,879
and my mum's not ready
to accept that yet.

99
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:09,428
- Right.
- And I shot the cat up the asshole.

100
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:11,078
Right.

101
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:17,188
Well, we'll have to have
a party at your flat.

102
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:22,035
Yeah... Actually, Daisy,
he's staying here. I spoke to Marsha.

103
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:24,156
She said, "The more the merrier."

104
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:26,708
As far as she knows, he's
staying in the spare room.

105
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,950
Oh, right. Oh... my room.

106
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,359
- Yeah.
- I see.

107
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:33,113
Sorry to spring this on you,
he had nowhere to go.

108
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:37,478
- There was a bed going, so...
- It's fine. Fine.

109
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:39,869
Hope you haven't made
too much of a mess.

110

111
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:47,915
He'll be on the sofa by tonight.

112
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,275
Fine! It's fine. It's fine.

113
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:53,432
I've been sleeping rough
for two months.

114
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:56,239
Another night's not gonna kill me.

115
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:01,359
Let's see your photos.

116
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:07,754
No need for photos.
Welcome to the 21st century.

117
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,072
I got this cheap in Singapore.
Here we go.

118
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:18,470
I've got three two-hour tapes.
I just couldn't stop filming.

119
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:21,552
I'm thinking about going
into documentary filmmaking.

120
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:24,359
Travelogues. A Michael Palin
for the millennium.

121
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:27,318
I could use this as a pilot.
See what you think.

122
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:28,879
See what you think.

123
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:33,360

days. It's really early... '

- It's Daisy.

129
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:02,836
- Hi.
- Go there.

130
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,755
- D'you want some tea?
- Yes, please.

131
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:11,152
I got you some lapsang souchong
because I knew you were coming back.

132
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:12,559
Thanks.

133
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:15,837
Did you have a great time?

134
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:18,798
Yes. Yes, I did. It was amazing.

135
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:23,590
Incredible, you know.
So many different places and...

136
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:27,514
- (Brian moans)
- Is everything all right?

137
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:31,673
- Yes! Why?
- You seem different.

138
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:33,557
I feel different, Daisy.

139
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:35,949
- Are you on Prozac?
- No.

140
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:39,749
I'm just... I don't know...
I'm enjoying life

141
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:43,150
- and it's thanks... to you.
- Really?

142
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:44,958
It's because of you I met Twist.

143
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:48,112
I can't believe
I was single for so long.

144
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:51,237
Loooooove is
a beautiful thing, Daisy.

145
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:54,312
You should try it!

146
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:56,675
You two having fun, are you?

Well, Brian.
I'm very happy for you.

00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:20,149
Aaaaah!

Eeeee!

153
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,994
- Ow!
- Is this a new one?

154
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:27,355
- No, same one.
- Our one?

155
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,839
Yeah.

156

158
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:36,917
- Hello, kitten. Welcome home!
- Hello!

159
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:43,195
Hello, baby. How are you?
How's he been? Has he missed me?

160
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:46,989
He's fine. I had a bloke come
and put a dog flap out the back.

161
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:49,116
He loves it. He's never in.

162
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:53,591
That's cos Mummy's been away.
But she's back now, isn't she?

163
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:54,795
In your basket.

164
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:55,869
(Boys) Oooh.

165
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:59,919
Well, come in. Come and sit down.

166

Nice to have you back, Daisy.

169

I've got you something.

170
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:12,709
Oh! Duty free! How did you know?

171
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:18,394
- How was it, kitten? Was it magic?
- Oh, yes. It was.

172
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:21,392
I just feel energised, you know.

173
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:24,597
I feel creative.
I feel absolutely good.

174
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:27,716
Did you behave yourself?

175
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:28,915
What d'you mean?

176
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,638
Well, you know.

177
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:34,030
Young woman away on her own
without her beau.

178
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:36,076
Never know what might happen.

179
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:40,836
Half a bottle of ouzo destructo
and ooh, the regret.

180
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:43,593
I didn't actually go to Greece,
I went to Asia.

181
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:46,319
I know. No, I was just saying.

182
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:48,550
I trust you didn't play away.

183
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:50,153
Oooooh.

184
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:55,755
Well, there was...
There was one guy.

185
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:58,953
Go on.

186
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:03,715
'He was called Steven.

187
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:08,193
'I met him at the airport
on the way home.

188
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:10,350
'Nothing happened, just...

189
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:12,954
'He was really sweet.'

190
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:15,918
Ah, did he remind you of Tim?

191
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,036
Er, no. Not really.

192
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,955
'We just sort of found each other.

193
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:23,837
'Kindred spirits.

194
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:25,751
'You know...

195
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:29,355
'We talked for ages about
everything. It was great.

196
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:32,557
'He was so easy-going.

197
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:35,313
'I met a lot of really annoying
idiots on holiday.

198
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:38,710
'Going on and on,
but Steven just seemed...

199
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:42,031
'different.

200
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:46,432
'I don't know. He made
me feel relaxed. At ease.

201
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:48,351
'Like I could be myself.

202
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:57,956
'What can I say? He was like...
a real gentleman.'

203
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:00,270
- So what happened?
- I don't know.

204
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:02,794
'We were at arrivals,
just chatting.

205
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:06,589
'We were even gonna share a cab
and he just vanished.

206
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:19,160
'I must have lost him
in the crowd.'

207
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:22,232
Oh, well. You know what they say,

208
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:26,029
why go out for hamburger when
you can have steak at home?

209
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,599
Get off me, you bummer.

210
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:31,878
Oh, there she is,
duchess of the D grade.

211
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:34,428
Doing her A Levels, bless her.

212
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:36,158
Where the fuck have you been?

213
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:39,676
I don't mind you staying out late,
but at least you could phone.

214
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,193
(Door slams upstairs)

215
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:46,393
Right, I'm off.

216
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:48,436
Hang on, I've got something else.

217
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:51,830
- It's video footage of me.
- Oh, good.

218
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:54,070
Just see what you think.

219
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:57,470
It's nice to have you back safe,
Daisy. You look really well.

220
00:12:57,560 --> 00:13:00,438
A lot of people LOSE weight
when they're travelling.

221
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:02,351
(Door closes)

222
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:11,190
- You all right?
- Yeah.

223
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:16,596
I just feel a bit weird. That's all.

224
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:21,037
(Sighs) This time yesterday,
I was in Delhi.

225
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:24,874
- (Boys) Oooh!
- The most magical city in India.

226
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:29,476
Probably the world...
and now I'm just back in London.

227
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:33,189
- (Boys) Eeeeee.
- Where nothing ever happens.

228
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:40,878
It's not here.

229
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:43,599
We have the wrong bag?

230
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:47,995
Look.

231
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:53,438
Daisy Steiner, 23 Meteor Street,

232
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:55,112
Tufnell Park.

233
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:57,236
What do you want to do?

234
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:01,669
Get the car.

235
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:04,033
(Boys grunting)

236
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,639
- Look.
- Look.

237
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:15,631
- (Groaning)
- Kick-slam.

238
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:19,349
(Shouts)

239
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:20,589
(Groaning)

240
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:25,358
Come on, Daisy. Why don't you
come and have a fight?

241
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:35,394
(Screams)

242
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:38,833
No.

243
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:41,309
Suit yourself.

244
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:44,439
Can't we go down the pub?

245
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:45,714
The pub?

246
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:47,631
I REALLY want to go.

247
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:51,918
I fancy a pint of Guinness and
some salt and vinegar crisps.

248
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,673
I'm jet-lagged and I don't
want to fall asleep.

249
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:59,072
Daisy! Coming?

250
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:02,277
Yeah, just give me a second.

251
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:07,794
I'm wearing nothing at all.

252
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:10,155
What are you wearing?

253
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:11,798
(Groans)

254
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:17,235
Ooh, Prada.

255
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:19,356
What's Prada?

256
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:24,473
- Is he coming?
- I left him a note.

257
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:26,710
Right, you can buy
the first round.

258
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,995
- I've only got rupees.
- God, all right.

259
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:31,275
- Mike can get the first round.
- What?

260
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:33,669
I just want to have
a nice, relaxing day.

261
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:49,399
(Doorbell buzzes)

262
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,353
(Buzzes again)

263
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:02,832
(Buzzes)

264
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:09,038
- Yes?
- Daisy Steiner?

265
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:10,235
Yes.

266
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:14,279
- Are you Daisy Steiner?
- No.

267
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:16,112
Do you know where she is?

268
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:18,873
- No.
- Do you know where she is?

269
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:20,279
Why?

270
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:23,670
Miss Steiner is under suspicion
of bringing a bag

271
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:26,797
containing sensitive materials
into the country.

272
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:27,995
Sensitive...

273
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:30,548
Can you tell us
where she is, Mr Topp?

274
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:33,791
How do you know my name?

275
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:36,110
It's written on the doorbell.

276
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:38,955
Oh, right.

277
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,473
Where is she, Brian?

278
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:44,075
Brian isn't on the doorbell.

279
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:47,038
- Where is she?
- Er...

280
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:51,316
What pub?

281
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:18,719
(Sighs)

282
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:21,314
Right, I'm off to point
the pink pistol

283
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:23,072
at the porcelain firing range.

284
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:32,359
Oi oi.

285
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:40,672
Come on, Daisy. It can't be
that bad being back.

286
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:44,389
I'm fine. I was really
looking forward to coming back.

287
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:45,993
Seeing everybody.

288
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:49,959
Yeah, I've been looking forward
to seeing you, too. I have.

289
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:52,634
It's been really weird
since you've been away.

290
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:54,517
The flat's been very different.

291
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:59,230
- There's been... something missing.
- Really, what?

292
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:02,073
Um... The smell.

293
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:06,868
- Daisy Steiner?
- (Both) Yeah.

294
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,712
Would you come with us, please?

295
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:09,915
Where are you going?

296
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,070
Would you come with us, please?

297
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:13,479
No. I'm all right here.

298
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:15,949
Miss Steiner,
I don't want to tell you again.

299
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:17,792
I think you should go with them.

300
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:19,711
No. I don't know who they are.

301
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:21,756
Miss Steiner,
you are under suspicion

302
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:24,434
of illegally bringing
sensitive materials

303
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:26,954
- into the country.
- What, a kite?

304
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:31,318
We have your partner in custody,
Miss Steiner.

305
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:34,551
- Your partner?
- A Mr Steven Edwards.

306
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:37,871
Who is Steven Edwards, Daisy?

307
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:39,075
Daisy!

308
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:43,597
(Daisy)
'He was like a real gentleman.

309
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:46,194
(Echoes) 'Gentleman. Gentleman.'

310
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:49,431
- Little shit.
- Who is Steven Edwards?

311
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:51,238
- We met at the airport.
- Did you?

312
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:54,232
- Miss Steiner.
- Do you mind? I'm... Ow!

313
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:55,355
(Whistles)

314
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:59,558
Say hello to my little friend.

315
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:06,557
Huh?

316
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:08,790
Shit!

317
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:33,515
(Groans)

318
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:37,675
That just happened, didn't it?

319
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:39,637
Er, yeah.

320
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:51,512
(Daisy) 'Here we are
going down the corridor.

321
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:53,670
'Hello.'

322
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:57,150
Stop walking in front of the
telly. Your tights are strobing.

323
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:58,912
You will go out looking like a...

324
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,149
(Rustling on TV)

325
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:01,912
Bloody hell!

326
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:07,549
Note to self.
Shoot first, quip later.

327
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:10,438
Where did you learn to take care
of yourself like that?

328
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:14,274
Let's say my time in Asia wasn't
just spent sightseeing.

329
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:22,548
I've changed, Tim.

330
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:28,272
Your front door's open.

331
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:35,715
- Brian.
- Welcome home, Miss Steiner.

332
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:39,470
They arrived just before you did.

333
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:41,232
You Lando.

334
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:42,833
Take a seat, Miss Steiner.

335
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:46,993
And let us not have a repeat
of our last encounter.

336
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:49,435
You're beginning to try my patience.

337
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:51,556
We have the bag, Miss Steiner.

338
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:54,677
- I didn't know I had it.
- There's no point resisting.

339
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:57,149
You have illegally carried goods
into this country,

340
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:59,708
contravening
every customs law there is

341
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:02,872
and we have all the evidence
we need to bring you in.

342
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:05,269
No, you don't.

343
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:08,318
- Marsha!
- Hello, everybody.

344
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:09,469
(Mumble)

345
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:11,949
Hello, Brian.

346
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:13,553
(Mumbles)

347
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:14,755
What is this?

348
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:16,796
I think this
will clear everything up.

349
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:19,440
- We don't have time for this.
- Oi!

350
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:24,839
- Timmy!
- Wait!

351
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:45,155
Thanks for your help, Mrs Klein.

352
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:49,552
- It's Miss, actually.
- Miss Klein.

353
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:50,755
(Clicks)

354
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:53,593
We'll keep this for study,
Miss Steiner.

355
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:56,672
Don't even think
about leaving the country.

356
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:59,558
Don't worry. I won't.

357
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:01,834
I can't afford it.

358
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:03,399
(Growls)

359
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:06,038
(Sighing)

360
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:26,676
(Sighs) That's better.
You'd never know he'd been here.

361
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:36,115
Aw, he's like a giant baby.

362
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:38,077
With a moustache.

363
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:41,277
Thanks for letting him stay.
He won't be here too long.

364
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,316
That's OK. I like having him here.

365
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:46,073
I'm sorry about your kite.

366
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:48,594
- My kite?
- Yeah. I got it for you.

367
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:50,159
- Did you?
- Yeah.

368
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:53,357
Sure you didn't get it
for Steven Edwards?

369
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:56,318
It was a weird day, wasn't it?

370
00:22:56,400 --> 00:23:00,029
- Sort of...
- Slightly unbelievable.

371
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:03,590
- It's nice to be back, though.
- It's nice to have you back.

372
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:08,510
Get off me, you Joey.

373
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:13,236
'Hello and welcome to Bangkok.

374
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:17,711
'I am in the Phad Phang
Pang Pong Phankam...

375
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:21,509
'It's something like that...
Memorial Peace Gardens.

376
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:24,831
'I've been here
for about four days.

377
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:26,353
'It's early in the morning.

378
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:28,874
'It's about five
so it's quite chilly.'

379
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:30,916
(Snoring)

380
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,399
(Daisy continues)

381
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:37,071
I hate this job.
