00:14:55,646 --> 00:14:56,980
What's her name?

189
00:14:58,982 --> 00:15:02,069
Is there no sun
in this cursed country?

190
00:15:02,152 --> 00:15:03,779
Which way is east?

191
00:15:03,862 --> 00:15:05,739
- Her name.
- East!

192
00:15:05,822 --> 00:15:08,116
Her name.

193
00:15:13,330 --> 00:15:16,333
- Jasmina.
- That way.

194
00:15:16,375 --> 00:15:18,418
You are sure?

195
00:15:18,502 --> 00:15:21,630
I would know blindfolded.
I'm five miles from home.

196
00:15:26,677 --> 00:15:28,262
Was she worth it?

197
00:15:30,973 --> 00:15:33,392
Worth dying for.

198
00:15:33,475 --> 00:15:34,017
[Dogs Barking]

199
00:15:34,017 --> 00:15:35,394
[Dogs Barking]

200
00:15:39,189 --> 00:15:40,607
We've got him now!

201
00:16:04,548 --> 00:16:07,509
[Dogs Barking]

202
00:16:17,394 --> 00:16:19,021
Ha ha ha.

203
00:16:25,611 --> 00:16:27,237
You're dog's meat, son,
you know that.

204
00:16:28,739 --> 00:16:30,115
Get down here!

205
00:16:30,199 --> 00:16:31,909
You know that
you're doomed!

206
00:16:31,992 --> 00:16:33,410
Come down here!

207
00:16:33,493 --> 00:16:34,411
Down!

208
00:16:34,494 --> 00:16:36,079
You're not playing
by the rules, boy.

209
00:16:36,163 --> 00:16:38,999
Deer don't climb trees.

210
00:16:39,082 --> 00:16:41,960
Perhaps he thinks
he's a game bird.

211
00:16:42,044 --> 00:16:42,961
Ha ha ha!

212
00:16:43,045 --> 00:16:44,963
Shall we
teach him to fly?

213
00:16:45,047 --> 00:16:45,964
Yeah.

214
00:16:46,048 --> 00:16:47,674
Get him down.

215
00:16:49,009 --> 00:16:50,219
[Robin]
Hold!

216
00:16:51,637 --> 00:16:53,597
I'm curious as to
what manner of creature...

217
00:16:53,639 --> 00:16:56,767
is so fearsome that it
takes six men to attack it.

218
00:16:56,850 --> 00:16:59,770
Stranger, this is
no affair of yours.

219
00:16:59,853 --> 00:17:02,189
Well, have we treed
the devil himself?

220
00:17:02,272 --> 00:17:03,732
Let me see.

221
00:17:03,774 --> 00:17:07,694
A small boy...
a truly dangerous animal.

222
00:17:07,778 --> 00:17:10,739
This boy killed one of
the sheriff of Nottingham's deer.

223
00:17:10,781 --> 00:17:12,282
You starve us!

224
00:17:12,324 --> 00:17:14,201
We needed the meat.

225
00:17:14,284 --> 00:17:16,245
I advise you
to move on, pilgrim.

226
00:17:16,286 --> 00:17:17,746
This is the sheriff s land.

227
00:17:17,788 --> 00:17:18,872
Wrong.

228
00:17:18,956 --> 00:17:21,250
This is my land and my tree.

229
00:17:21,333 --> 00:17:25,212
Therefore, whatever is in it
also belongs to me.

230
00:17:25,295 --> 00:17:28,215
Might I have
the pleasure of your name...

231
00:17:28,298 --> 00:17:31,218
before I have you
run through?

232
00:17:31,301 --> 00:17:34,304
Robin of Locksley.

233
00:17:37,975 --> 00:17:40,936
Well, well. Locksley.

234
00:17:42,479 --> 00:17:43,981
Welcome home.

235
00:17:45,524 --> 00:17:46,775
Kill him!

236
00:17:50,821 --> 00:17:51,905
Aah!

237
00:17:51,989 --> 00:17:52,990
Azeem!

238
00:17:53,073 --> 00:17:54,992
It's time
to redeem that vow!

239
00:17:55,075 --> 00:17:56,994
Unleash the hounds!

240
00:17:59,329 --> 00:18:01,623
Get off your damn knees!

241
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:07,171
Look out!

242
00:18:13,552 --> 00:18:14,720
[Boy]
Yay!

243
00:18:20,017 --> 00:18:21,310
Now, sir...

244
00:18:21,351 --> 00:18:24,813
if you'd be so kind
as to give me your name...

245
00:18:24,897 --> 00:18:26,273
before I run you through.

246
00:18:26,356 --> 00:18:30,277
Guy of Gisborne,
the sheriff s cousin.

247
00:18:31,862 --> 00:18:34,323
That little bastard
was poaching deer.

248
00:18:34,406 --> 00:18:38,535
Poaching? Is it not
a greater crime to starve a family?

249
00:18:38,619 --> 00:18:41,163
Go on, Locksley.

250
00:18:42,789 --> 00:18:43,999
Go on.

251
00:18:44,082 --> 00:18:48,879
I've seen enough blood spilt
to last two lifetimes.

252
00:18:48,962 --> 00:18:51,006
Now get off my land.

253
00:18:57,638 --> 00:19:00,057
And tell Nottingham
what happens to his scum...

254
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:02,059
when they
pick on small children.

255
00:19:05,771 --> 00:19:07,397
You.

256
00:19:07,481 --> 00:19:10,067
You traveled 10,000 miles
to save my life...

257
00:19:10,150 --> 00:19:12,069
then leave me
to be butchered?

258
00:19:12,110 --> 00:19:15,113
I fulfill my vows
when I choose.

259
00:19:15,197 --> 00:19:17,407
Which does not
include prayer times...

260
00:19:17,491 --> 00:19:20,410
or mealtimes or anytime
I'm outnumbered 6-to-1.

261
00:19:20,494 --> 00:19:22,913
You whine like a mule.

262
00:19:22,996 --> 00:19:24,915
You are still alive.

263
00:19:32,506 --> 00:19:34,424
Have no fear.
Come down, boy.

264
00:19:40,013 --> 00:19:43,433
Is it true, boy?
Did you kill a deer?

265
00:19:43,517 --> 00:19:44,935
Hundreds of them.

266
00:19:50,357 --> 00:19:51,775
You scared him.

267
00:19:57,865 --> 00:19:59,575
Interesting place, this...

268
00:19:59,658 --> 00:20:01,451
England.

269
00:20:11,712 --> 00:20:13,714
[Bell Clanging]

270
00:20:16,383 --> 00:20:17,801
[Bird Squawking]

271
00:20:22,055 --> 00:20:23,473
Hold up, Sir Guy.

272
00:20:23,557 --> 00:20:25,475
The sheriff s not
to be disturbed.

273
00:20:33,567 --> 00:20:34,651
Cousin.

274
00:20:34,735 --> 00:20:37,487
I trust you justify
your intrusion...

275
00:20:37,571 --> 00:20:40,157
with news of profound value.

276
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:42,784
I met a hooded man today...

277
00:20:42,826 --> 00:20:45,996
who bade me warn you
not to harm his people.

278
00:20:46,079 --> 00:20:48,874
Who told you to cover up?

279
00:20:48,957 --> 00:20:49,958
His name?

280
00:20:50,042 --> 00:20:53,504
Robin of Locksley.

281
00:20:53,545 --> 00:20:56,006
The prodigal son returns.

282
00:20:56,048 --> 00:20:59,009
He's a whelp.
This girl could best him.

283
00:20:59,051 --> 00:21:00,969
Put it there!

284
00:21:04,515 --> 00:21:08,310
Yes, well, this whelp
bested four of my men.

285
00:21:08,352 --> 00:21:11,480
Yes, well, your men
were probably drunk.

286
00:21:13,524 --> 00:21:15,776
And yet you survived, cousin.

287
00:21:15,859 --> 00:21:17,611
I barely survived.

288
00:21:25,035 --> 00:21:26,787
Yes, yes. I'm sure
it would take an army...

289
00:21:26,870 --> 00:21:29,456
to match these rogues.

290
00:21:29,540 --> 00:21:31,333
I trust Locksley's
visited his manor...

291
00:21:31,416 --> 00:21:34,336
and found the home fires
still burning.

292
00:21:37,214 --> 00:21:39,132
Time for potence, cousin.

293
00:21:50,519 --> 00:21:52,688
Mortianna?

294
00:21:58,402 --> 00:22:00,028
[Grumbling]

295
00:22:08,704 --> 00:22:10,706
- [Squawks]
- Shut up!

296
00:22:21,466 --> 00:22:23,177
You cold, madam?

297
00:22:32,603 --> 00:22:34,062
Chit-chit-chit-chit-choo.

298
00:22:34,104 --> 00:22:35,397
Ya, ya, ya.

299
00:22:54,791 --> 00:22:56,376
What do you see?

300
00:22:58,545 --> 00:23:01,048
The son of a dead man.

301
00:23:01,131 --> 00:23:02,758
Locksley.

302
00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:04,384
Does he affect us?

303
00:23:04,468 --> 00:23:06,428
He precedes the lionheart.

304
00:23:06,512 --> 00:23:08,972
King Richard returns
from the Crusades.

305
00:23:09,056 --> 00:23:11,475
That could prove
a bit awkward.

306
00:23:11,558 --> 00:23:13,477
It would soften the spines
of the barons.

307
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:14,478
Soon?

308
00:23:14,561 --> 00:23:15,979
Make haste.

309
00:23:16,063 --> 00:23:18,732
But my plan is still intact?

310
00:23:19,858 --> 00:23:21,860
Aah!

311
00:23:21,944 --> 00:23:23,237
What's wrong?

312
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:27,950
I have seen our death.

313
00:23:28,033 --> 00:23:29,368
The painted man...

314
00:23:29,451 --> 00:23:30,869
he haunts my dreams...

315
00:23:30,953 --> 00:23:34,414
adorned with strange
foreign markings.

316
00:23:34,498 --> 00:23:36,625
Ah! Locksley's companion.

317
00:23:37,668 --> 00:23:39,753
Kill him!

318
00:23:39,837 --> 00:23:42,256
Kill them both!

319
00:23:42,339 --> 00:23:43,799
[Moaning]

320
00:23:49,888 --> 00:23:51,598
Father?

321
00:23:52,891 --> 00:23:53,851
Father!

322
00:23:53,892 --> 00:23:55,477
Is anyone here?

323
00:23:57,396 --> 00:23:58,313
Duncan!

324
00:23:59,565 --> 00:24:00,482
Father!

325
00:24:16,415 --> 00:24:18,792
No!

326
00:24:18,876 --> 00:24:20,043
No.

327
00:24:20,127 --> 00:24:21,545
Who is it?

328
00:24:21,628 --> 00:24:23,046
It's my father.

329
00:24:23,130 --> 00:24:24,423
[Footsteps]

330
00:24:27,885 --> 00:24:29,303
Who's there?

331
00:24:30,721 --> 00:24:33,307
Who's there?

332
00:24:33,390 --> 00:24:34,474
Master Robin?

333
00:24:35,726 --> 00:24:37,811
Is that you?

334
00:24:37,895 --> 00:24:39,021
Duncan?

335
00:24:39,104 --> 00:24:40,814
Oh, praise be.

336
00:24:40,898 --> 00:24:43,317
I thought God
had abandoned us.

337
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:44,818
Duncan, my father.

338
00:24:44,902 --> 00:24:46,320
Oh, it's a miracle.

339
00:24:46,403 --> 00:24:48,822
Why... Why didn't
you cut him down?

340
00:24:48,906 --> 00:24:50,324
It's a miracle.

341
00:24:50,407 --> 00:24:51,491
I never thought that...

342
00:24:51,575 --> 00:24:52,826
Are you deaf?

343
00:24:52,910 --> 00:24:53,827
Easy!

344
00:24:53,911 --> 00:24:55,829
Look at him.

345
00:24:55,913 --> 00:24:58,999
I would have done
if I could see.

346
00:25:03,420 --> 00:25:05,839
Who did this to you,
Duncan?

347
00:25:05,923 --> 00:25:07,341
Guy... Guy of Gisborne...

348
00:25:07,424 --> 00:25:11,261
with the sheriff and
his witch looking on.

349
00:25:11,345 --> 00:25:13,263
Why?

350
00:25:13,347 --> 00:25:14,932
They say that the sheriff...

351
00:25:15,015 --> 00:25:17,851
captured your father
worshiping the devil...

352
00:25:17,935 --> 00:25:19,561
that he signed a confession...

353
00:25:19,603 --> 00:25:21,355
before the bishop.

354
00:25:21,438 --> 00:25:23,607
No.

355
00:25:23,690 --> 00:25:26,068
That's not possible.

356
00:25:26,151 --> 00:25:29,696
Nottingham declared
all Locksley lands forfeit.

357
00:25:29,780 --> 00:25:31,615
Did you believe the charges?

358
00:25:33,116 --> 00:25:36,912
Not even when
they took my eyes.

359
00:25:39,289 --> 00:25:41,250
[Sobbing]

360
00:25:47,965 --> 00:25:49,550
We must go.

361
00:25:53,345 --> 00:25:56,557
He loved you till the end,
young master.

362
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:59,560
He never gave up hope
of your return.

363
00:25:59,643 --> 00:26:01,562
I should have been here.

364
00:26:04,147 --> 00:26:07,067
He called the Crusades
a foolish quest.

365
00:26:07,150 --> 00:26:10,487
He said it was vanity
to force other men...

366
00:26:10,571 --> 00:26:12,447
to our religion.

367
00:26:12,489 --> 00:26:14,783
But you must flee now.

368
00:26:14,867 --> 00:26:16,326
Head south to safety.

369
00:26:16,368 --> 00:26:18,328
Gisborne will
surely seek revenge.

370
00:26:18,370 --> 00:26:19,830
I hear you, Duncan.

371
00:26:22,082 --> 00:26:23,417
You should go home.

372
00:26:24,668 --> 00:26:27,671
My world's turned
upside down here.

What is this place?

381
00:27:11,507 --> 00:27:13,008
Peter's home.

382
00:27:13,091 --> 00:27:16,845
It's nearly six years
since we left together.

383

is at her door.

00:39:47,179 --> 00:39:49,223
Well, this here
is our river...

559
00:39:49,306 --> 00:39:52,309
and any man
who wishes to cross...

560
00:39:52,351 --> 00:39:53,644
must pay a tax.

561
00:39:53,727 --> 00:39:56,605
I will pay no tax.

562
00:39:56,647 --> 00:39:58,106
As you can see...

563
00:39:58,190 --> 00:40:00,901
I have nothing...

564
00:40:00,984 --> 00:40:02,569
not even my sword.

565
00:40:02,653 --> 00:40:04,446
Bollocks!

566
00:40:04,530 --> 00:40:06,949
Any man who travels
with two servants...

567
00:40:07,032 --> 00:40:09,952
and claims he's got
no bloody money...

568
00:40:10,035 --> 00:40:11,453
is either a fool...

569
00:40:11,495 --> 00:40:13,080
or a liar.

570
00:40:13,163 --> 00:40:15,123
Yeah, he's a liar!

571
00:40:15,165 --> 00:40:16,667
Who are you?

572
00:40:16,750 --> 00:40:18,627
John Little...

573
00:40:20,003 --> 00:40:21,880
best man of the woods.

574
00:40:21,964 --> 00:40:24,925
- Yeah!
- Yay!

575
00:40:25,008 --> 00:40:29,638
Well, best man,
do you lead this rabble?

576
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:30,639
- Whoa!
- Oh!

577
00:40:30,681 --> 00:40:32,724
Yes, I do, mate.

578
00:40:32,808 --> 00:40:36,228
And if you tosspots want to travel
through Sherwood Forest...

579
00:40:36,311 --> 00:40:39,106
it's going to cost you...

580
00:40:39,189 --> 00:40:41,149
that gold medallion.

581
00:40:44,903 --> 00:40:46,864
This is sacred to me.

582
00:40:46,947 --> 00:40:49,825
It's sacred to us,
too, matey.

583
00:40:49,908 --> 00:40:52,661
That there will feed us
for a blooming month.

584
00:40:52,744 --> 00:40:55,831
You'll have to
fight me for it.

585
00:40:55,914 --> 00:40:57,291
Whoa! Whoa!

586
00:40:57,374 --> 00:40:59,209
Love to, mate.

587
00:40:59,293 --> 00:41:02,296
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

588
00:41:05,549 --> 00:41:07,009
Be careful, Father.

589
00:41:07,050 --> 00:41:10,053
He walloped 12 of
the sheriff s men.

590
00:41:10,137 --> 00:41:11,555
Is that so?

591
00:41:11,638 --> 00:41:14,224
Reckon I'm going
to enjoy this.

592
00:41:15,350 --> 00:41:16,894
Hey!

593
00:41:16,977 --> 00:41:18,979
That's your father?

594
00:41:20,105 --> 00:41:22,149
Come on, John!

595
00:41:22,232 --> 00:41:23,192
Knock him over, John!

596
00:41:23,192 --> 00:41:24,818
Knock him over, John!

597
00:41:33,785 --> 00:41:35,704
Ha ha ha ha!

598
00:41:45,589 --> 00:41:47,382
Whoa!

599
00:41:52,012 --> 00:41:55,516
[Will Scarlett]
He's drowning!

600
00:41:55,599 --> 00:41:57,726
Lost something?

601
00:41:58,936 --> 00:42:02,648
Thanks for the taxes.
Ha ha ha!

602
00:42:02,731 --> 00:42:04,316
Looks like
the little rich boy...

603
00:42:04,399 --> 00:42:06,151
is lost for words, eh?

604
00:42:07,319 --> 00:42:09,279
Any great ideas?

605
00:42:09,363 --> 00:42:10,572
Get up!

606
00:42:10,614 --> 00:42:12,032
Move faster!

607
00:42:12,115 --> 00:42:13,951
Move faster.

608
00:42:14,034 --> 00:42:14,952
Great idea.

609
00:42:21,917 --> 00:42:23,377
Watch it, John!

610
00:42:27,756 --> 00:42:29,174
We're not through yet.

611
00:42:29,258 --> 00:42:31,677
All right, my old cocker.

612
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:33,971
You want another
good walloping?

613
00:42:34,054 --> 00:42:35,556
You shall have one.

614
00:42:46,817 --> 00:42:47,901
Ohh!

615
00:42:47,985 --> 00:42:50,612
Seems I've made it
past the gate, John Little.

616
00:42:50,696 --> 00:42:53,323
Or should I call you
LittleJohn?

617
00:42:53,407 --> 00:42:55,117
[Wulf]
Hit him, Father! Wallop him!

618
00:43:17,556 --> 00:43:19,975
Swimming time again,
old chum.

619
00:43:20,017 --> 00:43:22,019
Ohh!

620
00:43:34,156 --> 00:43:35,574
[Wulf]
Where is he?

621
00:43:35,657 --> 00:43:37,117
Do you see him?

622
00:43:49,671 --> 00:43:52,299
It's a bloomin' shame.

623
00:43:52,382 --> 00:43:54,468
He was a brave lad.

624
00:43:56,053 --> 00:43:57,679
Ooh! Aah!

625
00:43:59,348 --> 00:44:01,433
Help!

626
00:44:01,517 --> 00:44:02,935
Do you yield?

627
00:44:03,018 --> 00:44:04,436
I can't bloody swim!

628
00:44:06,688 --> 00:44:08,065
Do you yield?

629
00:44:08,148 --> 00:44:09,066
Yes!

630
00:44:09,149 --> 00:44:11,652
Good. Now put
your feet down.

631
00:44:18,033 --> 00:44:19,368
I'll be buggered.

632
00:44:21,411 --> 00:44:23,872
- The medallion.
- Give me your name first.

633
00:44:25,207 --> 00:44:27,167
Robin of Locksley.

634
00:44:27,251 --> 00:44:30,462
Well,
Robin of Locksley...

635
00:44:30,546 --> 00:44:32,881
you got balls of solid rock.

636
00:44:32,923 --> 00:44:33,882
Come on.

637
00:44:33,966 --> 00:44:35,509
[Laughing]

638
00:44:38,053 --> 00:44:39,888
That's Much,
the Miller's son...

639
00:44:39,972 --> 00:44:41,139
Harold Brownwell...

640
00:44:41,223 --> 00:44:43,642
and that stumpy one there
is David of Doncaster...

641
00:44:43,725 --> 00:44:46,645
but the lads
all calls him Bull.

642
00:44:46,728 --> 00:44:47,646
[Laughing]

643
00:44:47,729 --> 00:44:49,064
'Cause you're short?

644
00:44:49,147 --> 00:44:52,401
No. It's 'cause
I'm so long!

645
00:44:55,112 --> 00:44:56,738
Yeah, look.

646
00:44:56,780 --> 00:45:00,117
No, Bull.
Save it. Save it for the ladies.

647
00:45:00,200 --> 00:45:02,202
Give the man some mead.

648
00:45:02,286 --> 00:45:04,621
Very good, isn't it?

649
00:45:05,998 --> 00:45:08,625
Now, I made that myself.

650
00:45:08,709 --> 00:45:12,171
Has English hospitality
changed so much in six years...

651
00:45:12,254 --> 00:45:16,175
that a friend of mine's
not welcome at this table?

652
00:45:16,258 --> 00:45:18,177
But he's a savage, sire.

653
00:45:19,761 --> 00:45:22,306
That he is.

654
00:45:22,389 --> 00:45:25,100
But no more than you or I.

655
00:45:28,270 --> 00:45:30,189
And don't call me sire.

656
00:45:32,274 --> 00:45:35,444
With regret, I must decline.

657
00:45:36,570 --> 00:45:38,071
Allah forbids it.

658
00:45:38,155 --> 00:45:39,781
Your bloody loss, mate.

659
00:45:39,865 --> 00:45:43,202
How is it there are
so many of you in hiding?

660
00:45:43,285 --> 00:45:44,620
Well, we're all outlaws.

661
00:45:44,661 --> 00:45:46,830
Got prices on our heads.

662
00:45:46,914 --> 00:45:48,707
Even the young lad there.

663
00:45:48,790 --> 00:45:50,125
He's a blasted sheriff.

664
00:45:50,542 --> 00:45:52,878
He says we owes him taxes.

665
00:45:52,961 --> 00:45:54,379
Well, you know,
your ghost...

666
00:45:54,463 --> 00:45:57,716
will only keep the sheriff s men
at bay so long.

667
00:45:57,799 --> 00:45:59,218
They've worked so far.

668
00:45:59,301 --> 00:46:01,220
You have a better idea?

669
00:46:06,308 --> 00:46:07,935
You can always fight back.

670
00:46:08,018 --> 00:46:09,853
Yeah.
Ha ha ha ha.

671
00:46:11,271 --> 00:46:14,733
I reckon I must have cracked
that noble head of yours.

672
00:46:14,816 --> 00:46:17,236
These are all good lads here.

673
00:46:17,319 --> 00:46:19,863
They got hearts of oak,
but they're farmers.

674
00:46:21,990 --> 00:46:23,742
It'd be lambs
to the slaughter.

675
00:46:23,825 --> 00:46:27,412
They say the sheriff
was raised by a witch.

676
00:46:27,496 --> 00:46:28,413
Witch?

677
00:46:28,497 --> 00:46:30,082
She knows
every man's thoughts.

678
00:46:30,165 --> 00:46:32,000
You can see
right through her...

679
00:46:32,042 --> 00:46:33,126
and she flies.

680
00:46:33,210 --> 00:46:34,837
That's a load
of codswallop.

681
00:46:34,878 --> 00:46:37,256
What does the rich son
of a devil worshiper care...

682
00:46:37,339 --> 00:46:38,382
about outlaw peasants?

683
00:46:38,465 --> 00:46:40,467
My lord was a kind
and generous man!

684
00:46:40,551 --> 00:46:43,470
Who among you dares
believe him capable...

685
00:46:43,554 --> 00:46:46,473
Duncan. My father was
no devil worshiper...

686
00:46:46,557 --> 00:46:50,853
and I'll have words with any man
who says otherwise.

687
00:46:53,480 --> 00:46:54,898
But he's right.

688
00:46:57,150 --> 00:46:59,570
I was a rich man's son.

689
00:47:01,655 --> 00:47:04,908
But when I killed
the sheriff s men...

690
00:47:04,992 --> 00:47:07,744
I became an outlaw
like you.

691
00:47:07,828 --> 00:47:09,204
You are nothing like us.

692
00:47:11,164 --> 00:47:13,876
Well... that there's
Will Scarlett.

693
00:47:13,959 --> 00:47:16,086
Don't take no note of him.

694
00:47:16,170 --> 00:47:18,088
He's full of piss and wind.

695
00:47:18,172 --> 00:47:20,048
Come on, lads, drink up.

696
00:47:20,132 --> 00:47:23,719
Stop talking
so much bloody rubbish.

697
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:27,306
This here is the best
we simple men can expect.

698
00:47:27,389 --> 00:47:28,807
Here we're safe.

699
00:47:30,350 --> 00:47:31,768
Here...

700
00:47:31,852 --> 00:47:33,562
we are kings.

701
00:47:33,645 --> 00:47:36,273
Ha ha ha!
Ha ha ha!

702
00:47:40,194 --> 00:47:43,947
[Rooster Crows]

703
00:47:44,031 --> 00:47:46,033
[Coughing]

704
00:47:46,116 --> 00:47:47,451
[Sheep Bleats]

705
00:47:47,534 --> 00:47:49,745
[Coughing]

706
00:47:52,289 --> 00:47:53,123
Aah!

707
00:47:53,207 --> 00:47:55,626
Aah!

708
00:47:58,212 --> 00:48:00,130
Too much mead, old friend?

709
00:48:00,214 --> 00:48:02,132
Oh, forgive me.
I oversleep.

710
00:48:02,216 --> 00:48:03,842
No, no.
Rest yourself.

711
00:48:13,727 --> 00:48:15,646
What day is it, Duncan?

712
00:48:15,729 --> 00:48:17,147
Sunday, I think.

713
00:48:18,732 --> 00:48:21,652
Do they still give alms
to the poor at mass?

714
00:48:21,735 --> 00:48:23,153
That they do.

715
00:48:23,237 --> 00:48:25,155
These days,
the need for mercy...

716
00:48:25,239 --> 00:48:26,657
is greater than ever.

717
00:48:43,173 --> 00:48:45,634
Well, my other god calls.

718
00:48:46,927 --> 00:48:49,805
Oh, don't upset
yourself, Mortianna.

719
00:48:49,888 --> 00:48:52,432
Appearances are important
to that lot.

720
00:48:52,516 --> 00:48:54,476
Especially on a Sunday.

721
00:48:54,560 --> 00:48:58,480
You know my true faith
lies in the old ways.

722
00:49:00,357 --> 00:49:02,317
Although...

723
00:49:02,401 --> 00:49:05,237
frankly sometimes...

724
00:49:06,864 --> 00:49:09,241
I can't see much difference.

725
00:49:12,202 --> 00:49:14,162
Did my parents truly tell you...

726
00:49:14,204 --> 00:49:16,957
to instruct me in all this?

727
00:49:18,125 --> 00:49:20,836
Their dying wish.

728
00:49:32,598 --> 00:49:34,892
[Chuckles]

729
00:49:34,975 --> 00:49:37,144
Come on.

730
00:49:59,750 --> 00:50:03,378
We beseech thy blessing,
Lord...

731
00:50:03,420 --> 00:50:05,005
on all your people...

732
00:50:06,423 --> 00:50:08,509
but most especially...

733
00:50:08,592 --> 00:50:11,220
on our noble sheriff
of Nottingham.

734
00:50:12,429 --> 00:50:14,389
Grant him the wisdom...

735
00:50:14,431 --> 00:50:19,061
to guide and protect
our glorious city.

736
00:50:19,102 --> 00:50:21,563
Grant him also
the strength...

737
00:50:21,605 --> 00:50:23,565
to bring to justice...

738
00:50:23,607 --> 00:50:27,402
the lawless men who would
threaten its safety...

739
00:50:27,444 --> 00:50:29,905
and prosperity...

740
00:50:29,947 --> 00:50:33,033
and the judgment
to punish them...

741
00:50:33,116 --> 00:50:34,910
in your name.

742
00:50:34,952 --> 00:50:36,370
Amen.

743
00:50:36,453 --> 00:50:38,580
- Amen.
- Amen.

744
00:50:38,664 --> 00:50:41,208
Go in peace.

745
00:50:43,335 --> 00:50:45,087
Alms, please, sir.

746
00:50:46,338 --> 00:50:47,548
Please, madam.

747
00:50:49,466 --> 00:50:51,426
- Sarah.
- Yes.

748
00:50:51,468 --> 00:50:52,427
Thank you.

749
00:50:52,469 --> 00:50:53,428
Thank you.

750
00:50:53,470 --> 00:50:54,429
Ma'am.

751
00:50:54,471 --> 00:50:55,806
That's all I have.

752
00:50:55,889 --> 00:50:57,099
God bless you, mum.

753
00:51:14,992 --> 00:51:17,452
Alms for a blind man, milady?

754
00:51:17,494 --> 00:51:18,954
Mmm.

755
00:51:18,996 --> 00:51:21,623
For one who cannot
see your beauty.

756
00:51:25,169 --> 00:51:26,128
Hello.

757
00:51:26,170 --> 00:51:28,630
What are you doing here?

758
00:51:28,672 --> 00:51:30,465
Searching my soul.

759
00:51:30,507 --> 00:51:34,469
I do not wish to be seen
with an outlaw.

760
00:51:34,511 --> 00:51:36,972
You prefer the company
of Nottingham?

761
00:51:37,014 --> 00:51:38,974
There's a price
on your head.

762
00:51:39,016 --> 00:51:39,975
How much?

763
00:51:40,017 --> 00:51:41,476
100 gold pieces.

764
00:51:41,518 --> 00:51:42,978
Is that all?

765
00:51:43,020 --> 00:51:45,480
I'll have to annoy
the good sheriff more.

766
00:51:45,522 --> 00:51:47,482
Soon it will be 1,000.

767
00:51:47,524 --> 00:51:50,485
For 1,000, I would
turn you in myself.

768
00:51:50,527 --> 00:51:52,487
Nottingham is
mounting an army.

769
00:51:52,529 --> 00:51:54,990
He has every blacksmith
in the county...

770
00:51:55,032 --> 00:51:57,492
in the castle,
making swords and armor.

771
00:51:57,534 --> 00:51:58,994
What is he planning?

772
00:51:59,036 --> 00:52:01,496
I don't know,
but there's no limit...

773
00:52:01,538 --> 00:52:02,664
to the man's ambitions.

774
00:52:04,041 --> 00:52:05,334
Go!

775
00:52:05,375 --> 00:52:06,335
Thank you.

776
00:52:06,376 --> 00:52:07,336
Quickly! Go!

777
00:52:08,545 --> 00:52:10,005
Robin, do something for me.

778
00:52:10,047 --> 00:52:11,006
What?

779
00:52:11,048 --> 00:52:12,216
Take a bath.

780
00:52:12,299 --> 00:52:13,467
Take a bath?

781
00:52:33,570 --> 00:52:36,365
These are my private
chambers, my son.

782
00:52:38,075 --> 00:52:40,536
I have priests
who would hear your confession.

783
00:52:40,577 --> 00:52:41,828
- Gggt!
- Aah!

784
00:52:41,912 --> 00:52:44,331
Shh!

785
00:52:47,584 --> 00:52:51,380
I see the boy I knew
in the man before me.

786
00:52:53,257 --> 00:52:56,260
Welcome home, Robin.

787
00:52:56,343 --> 00:52:59,179
You shine like
the sun, milady.

788
00:52:59,263 --> 00:53:02,182
You've been meeting
with Robin of Locksley.

789
00:53:02,266 --> 00:53:03,559
My cousin tells me...

790
00:53:03,600 --> 00:53:06,562
the knave deprived
you of some horses.

791
00:53:06,603 --> 00:53:08,063
Oh... yes.

792
00:53:08,105 --> 00:53:09,565
A most disagreeable
experience.

793
00:53:09,606 --> 00:53:12,067
Yes, I know.
And for inflicting that upon you...

794
00:53:12,109 --> 00:53:15,571
I'm going to hang him
from the walls by his own entrails.

795
00:53:15,612 --> 00:53:17,072
I'd like to see that.

796
00:53:17,114 --> 00:53:18,699
If you'd bring
your household...

797
00:53:18,782 --> 00:53:20,075
within the city walls...

798
00:53:20,117 --> 00:53:22,578
I could give your every need
my personal attention.

799
00:53:22,619 --> 00:53:25,080
I do thank you,
but I prefer to stay...

800
00:53:25,122 --> 00:53:27,082
in my family's home
for now.

801
00:53:27,124 --> 00:53:30,586
Oh. Well, then, perhaps
you'd do me the honor...

802
00:53:30,627 --> 00:53:32,588
of accepting
a small token...

803
00:53:32,629 --> 00:53:35,299
of my undying devotion
to your safety.

804
00:53:35,382 --> 00:53:37,593
Oh!

805
00:53:37,634 --> 00:53:40,596
Why... King Richard
will be deeply moved...

806
00:53:40,637 --> 00:53:43,724
to hear of your concern
for my welfare.

807
00:53:43,807 --> 00:53:44,766
Yes, um...

808
00:53:44,808 --> 00:53:47,603
I'm afraid the king
has many enemies...

809
00:53:47,644 --> 00:53:49,605
both abroad
and at home.

810
00:53:49,646 --> 00:53:51,607
I fear for his safe return.

811
00:53:51,648 --> 00:53:53,609
Oh, no. Fear not,
dear sheriff.

812
00:53:53,650 --> 00:53:56,111
He will return,
and when he does...

813
00:53:56,153 --> 00:53:58,947
he will wish to reward
his faithful subjects.

814
00:54:02,826 --> 00:54:05,746
I asked your father
three times...

815
00:54:05,829 --> 00:54:08,624
if he worshiped
the dark one...

816
00:54:08,665 --> 00:54:12,628
because his answer
vexed me so grievously.

817
00:54:12,669 --> 00:54:14,630
He said...

818
00:54:14,713 --> 00:54:20,636
he must meet God
with a clear conscience.

819
00:54:29,853 --> 00:54:31,522
You lie.

820
00:54:38,445 --> 00:54:39,363
On your souls...

821
00:54:39,446 --> 00:54:41,823
do not shed blood
in the house of God!

822
00:54:46,537 --> 00:54:49,706
Aah!

823
00:54:49,790 --> 00:54:50,874
[Nottingham]
You bastard!

824
00:54:50,958 --> 00:54:52,000
In there!

825
00:54:53,502 --> 00:54:54,461
Get him!

826
00:54:54,545 --> 00:54:56,672
Get him!

827
00:55:00,676 --> 00:55:01,718
Locksley!

828
00:55:01,802 --> 00:55:04,137
I'm going to cut
your heart out...

829
00:55:04,179 --> 00:55:05,889
with a spoon!

830
00:55:05,973 --> 00:55:07,850
Then it begins.

831
00:55:12,187 --> 00:55:13,146
Aah!

832
00:55:13,188 --> 00:55:14,147
Aah!

833
00:55:22,739 --> 00:55:23,657
Aah!

834
00:55:23,740 --> 00:55:26,493
He's taking
the sheriff s horse!

835
00:55:30,581 --> 00:55:32,499
Close the gate!

836
00:55:32,583 --> 00:55:35,043
The sheriff s horse!
Close the gate!

837
00:55:35,085 --> 00:55:37,546
He's stolen
the sheriff s horse!

838
00:55:44,178 --> 00:55:45,721
Uhh!

839
00:55:55,606 --> 00:55:57,524
What are you looking at?

840
00:56:09,786 --> 00:56:11,747
There's a rider coming in!

841
00:56:18,128 --> 00:56:19,213
Water!

842
00:56:19,254 --> 00:56:20,214
Thank you.

843
00:56:20,255 --> 00:56:21,715
For the animal.

844
00:56:21,798 --> 00:56:23,717
How can I protect you,
Christian...

845
00:56:23,800 --> 00:56:26,220
if I know not
where you go?

846
00:56:26,261 --> 00:56:28,222
You've hardly raised
a finger...

847
00:56:28,263 --> 00:56:29,890
when you do know...

848
00:56:29,973 --> 00:56:30,891
great one.

849
00:56:32,142 --> 00:56:34,061
I prefer to have
the choice.

850
00:56:34,144 --> 00:56:36,563
Wonderful. You've stolen
the sheriff s horse?

851
00:56:36,647 --> 00:56:39,566
You've stirred up
a bloody hornet's nest now!

852
00:56:39,650 --> 00:56:41,068
Are you afraid, John?

853
00:56:41,151 --> 00:56:42,569
Yeah, a little.

854
00:56:42,653 --> 00:56:44,071
Well, so is the sheriff.

855
00:56:44,154 --> 00:56:46,740
Today I gave him a sting
he'll not forget.

856
00:56:46,823 --> 00:56:49,243
You fool!
You've started a war!

857
00:56:49,284 --> 00:56:50,744
We're already at war.

858
00:56:52,496 --> 00:56:53,497
Duncan...

859
00:56:53,580 --> 00:56:54,498
bread.

860
00:56:56,834 --> 00:56:58,752
And I say we strike back...

861
00:56:58,836 --> 00:57:00,754
at the very man
who takes our homes...

862
00:57:00,838 --> 00:57:02,089
and would
hunt our children.

863
00:57:02,172 --> 00:57:03,090
We?

864
00:57:03,173 --> 00:57:05,759
You planning to
join us then, matey?

865
00:57:07,010 --> 00:57:08,512
No, to lead you.

866
00:57:13,308 --> 00:57:15,102
Christian...

867
00:57:15,185 --> 00:57:16,687
these are simple people.

868
00:57:17,771 --> 00:57:19,189
They are not warriors.

869
00:57:19,273 --> 00:57:21,775
Be careful
you do not do this...

870
00:57:21,859 --> 00:57:23,110
for your own purposes.

871
00:57:23,193 --> 00:57:24,444
You forget yourself, Azeem.

872
00:57:24,486 --> 00:57:27,281
I do not ask for your company
or counsel.

873
00:57:29,199 --> 00:57:31,285
Why a spoon, cousin?

874
00:57:31,326 --> 00:57:33,287
Why not an ax
or something...

875
00:57:33,328 --> 00:57:35,289
Because it's dull, you twit!

876
00:57:35,330 --> 00:57:37,624
It'll hurt more!

877
00:57:37,708 --> 00:57:41,295
I want this brigand found.

878
00:57:41,336 --> 00:57:42,796
Starve them out!

879
00:57:42,880 --> 00:57:43,797
Slaughter their...

880
00:57:43,881 --> 00:57:45,799
No, take their livestock.

881
00:57:45,883 --> 00:57:49,303
I want Locksley's own people
fighting to bring his head in.

882
00:57:49,344 --> 00:57:52,306
Well, perhaps we could create
a name for him...

883
00:57:52,347 --> 00:57:55,309
something to drive fear
into the hearts of the populace.

884
00:57:55,350 --> 00:57:57,853
Maybe Locksley the Lethal
or Wreaking Robin or...

885
00:57:57,895 --> 00:57:58,896
Whatever!

886
00:57:58,979 --> 00:58:00,606
I want him dead
by the next full moon...

887
00:58:00,689 --> 00:58:03,108
before the barons
come back.

888
00:58:03,192 --> 00:58:04,276
Now sew...

889
00:58:06,361 --> 00:58:09,990
and keep the stitches small!

890
00:58:28,008 --> 00:58:29,760
He's not here, sir.

891
00:58:31,178 --> 00:58:34,097
Where is your mate,
the man they call Little?

892
00:58:34,181 --> 00:58:36,016
He died last winter.

893
00:58:36,099 --> 00:58:38,101
Burn it down.

894
00:58:38,185 --> 00:58:39,937
Light the other one.

895
00:58:44,650 --> 00:58:47,402
Leave us the sow.
Her young will feed us.

896
00:58:47,444 --> 00:58:50,072
Beware of
the Sherwood bandit.

897
00:58:50,113 --> 00:58:51,949
Robin of the Hood?
Yes, sir.

898
00:58:52,032 --> 00:58:55,285
Pray he's brought to us
before winter.

899
00:59:00,415 --> 00:59:01,542
Ma!

900
00:59:01,625 --> 00:59:02,793
Over here!

901
00:59:13,679 --> 00:59:15,347
Oh, John!

902
00:59:15,430 --> 00:59:16,640
Papa!

903
00:59:16,723 --> 00:59:18,892
They burned it, all of it.

904
00:59:20,644 --> 00:59:23,397
Where is this
Robin Hood now?

905
00:59:23,438 --> 00:59:25,274
He's there.

906
00:59:26,316 --> 00:59:29,778
Look! Look what
they've done!

907
00:59:33,240 --> 00:59:36,326
If it's fame
you seek, Christian...

908
00:59:36,410 --> 00:59:38,328
I think you have it.

909
00:59:41,248 --> 00:59:43,750
You brought this misery
on us, Locksley.

910
00:59:43,834 --> 00:59:46,253
It's Nottingham
trying to divide us.

911
00:59:46,336 --> 00:59:48,255
We are divided, rich boy.

912
00:59:48,338 --> 00:59:51,258
I'm not as blind
as that old man.

913
00:59:51,341 --> 00:59:54,261
You're still trying to be
lord of the manor.

914
00:59:54,344 --> 00:59:57,181
I heard today the sheriff
now values your neck...

915
00:59:57,264 --> 00:59:58,932
at 500 gold pieces.

916
01:00:00,475 --> 01:00:02,978
I say we take him in.

917
01:00:03,020 --> 01:00:04,605
- Aye.
- Aye.

918
01:00:04,646 --> 01:00:07,316
Do you think the sheriff
will return everything...

919
01:00:07,399 --> 01:00:08,817
after I'm gone?

920
01:00:08,859 --> 01:00:11,570
He'll give us the reward
and our pardons.

921
01:00:11,653 --> 01:00:12,821
Wrong.

922
01:00:14,948 --> 01:00:17,826
He'll stretch your
necks one by one.

923
01:00:17,910 --> 01:00:20,454
What would you
have us do...

924
01:00:20,495 --> 01:00:22,456
fight armored men
on horseback...

925
01:00:22,497 --> 01:00:24,958
with rocks
and our bare hands?

926
01:00:25,042 --> 01:00:26,460
If needs be.

927
01:00:26,502 --> 01:00:29,129
But with
the one true weapon...

928
01:00:29,213 --> 01:00:30,797
that escapes you, Will...

929
01:00:32,257 --> 01:00:33,717
courage.

930
01:00:41,600 --> 01:00:43,477
Look out!

931
01:00:57,366 --> 01:00:58,867
Thank you, Wulf.

932
01:01:00,619 --> 01:01:02,538
You wish to end this?

933
01:01:02,621 --> 01:01:04,665
You wish to go home?

934
01:01:04,748 --> 01:01:07,793
Then we must stop
fighting amongst ourselves...

935
01:01:07,876 --> 01:01:11,672
and face that the price
for it may be dear.

936
01:01:11,713 --> 01:01:13,549
I for one
would rather die...

937
01:01:13,632 --> 01:01:16,718
than to spend my life
in hiding.

938
01:01:16,802 --> 01:01:18,887
The sheriff calls us outlaws...

939
01:01:18,971 --> 01:01:21,431
but I say we are free.

940
01:01:21,515 --> 01:01:24,643
And one free man
defending his home...

941
01:01:24,726 --> 01:01:28,689
is more powerful
than 10 hired soldiers.

942
01:01:30,107 --> 01:01:32,192
The Crusades taught me that.

943
01:01:35,863 --> 01:01:39,032
I will make you
no promises save one...

944
01:01:40,450 --> 01:01:43,370
that if you truly believe
in your hearts...

945
01:01:43,453 --> 01:01:44,872
that you are free...

946
01:01:44,913 --> 01:01:47,207
then I say we can win.

947
01:01:47,291 --> 01:01:48,750
They got armor.

948
01:01:48,792 --> 01:01:49,877
Yeah! Right!

949
01:01:49,960 --> 01:01:51,628
They got armor, Bull?

950
01:01:51,712 --> 01:01:53,422
Even this boy
can be taught...

951
01:01:53,463 --> 01:01:55,924
to find chinks
in every suit of armor.

952
01:01:55,966 --> 01:01:58,051
We ain't got nothing to eat.

953
01:01:58,135 --> 01:02:01,096
What do we need that
the forest cannot provide?

954
01:02:01,138 --> 01:02:03,724
We have food,
wood for weapons.

955
01:02:03,765 --> 01:02:06,894
We'll find safety
and solace in her trees.

956
01:02:06,935 --> 01:02:08,896
Yeah, but
what about our kin?

957
01:02:08,937 --> 01:02:11,648
Sheriff s taken
all they got, too.

958
01:02:14,276 --> 01:02:17,112
Then, by God,
we take it back.

959
01:03:08,539 --> 01:03:09,790
Ho!

960
01:03:55,127 --> 01:03:56,170
Hyah!

961
01:04:01,049 --> 01:04:03,802
What's the meaning of this?

962
01:04:03,886 --> 01:04:06,305
Milady, a woman
of your beauty...

963
01:04:06,388 --> 01:04:08,056
has no need for
such decorations.

964
01:04:08,098 --> 01:04:10,184
How dare you!

965
01:04:14,271 --> 01:04:16,231
[Bell Rings]

966
01:04:19,067 --> 01:04:21,403
Please don't take that.

967
01:04:21,486 --> 01:04:23,280
Please don't take that.

968
01:04:23,363 --> 01:04:26,450
Please, sir, those
belong to our lord.

969
01:04:26,533 --> 01:04:29,036
Now they belong
to my lord sheriff!

970
01:04:40,255 --> 01:04:42,216
- Yay!
- Ha ha!

971
01:04:42,257 --> 01:04:44,760
Give it back.

972
01:04:44,801 --> 01:04:46,261
Good.
Tell the sheriff...

973
01:04:46,303 --> 01:04:48,972
for every harm he
does these people...

974
01:04:49,056 --> 01:04:52,059
I will visit it
back on him tenfold.

975
01:05:00,859 --> 01:05:02,778
Something vexes thee?

976
01:05:14,164 --> 01:05:15,749
What the devil?

977
01:05:15,832 --> 01:05:17,793
'Tis a hot day,
my friend...

978
01:05:17,876 --> 01:05:20,295
to burden your horse
with a heavy purse.

979
01:05:20,379 --> 01:05:23,257
The sheriff will hear of this.

980
01:05:27,135 --> 01:05:28,804
I truly hope so.

981
01:05:28,846 --> 01:05:30,055
Yeah!

982
01:05:37,229 --> 01:05:38,188
There, luv.

983
01:05:38,272 --> 01:05:39,773
Buy yourself
a new sow.

984
01:05:39,815 --> 01:05:42,442
God bless you, Fanny...

985
01:05:42,484 --> 01:05:44,611
and God bless Robin Hood.

986
01:05:47,447 --> 01:05:50,367
We reckon he's nicked
three to four million...

987
01:05:50,450 --> 01:05:53,287
in the last
five months, sire.

988
01:05:53,328 --> 01:05:56,790
All right, fine.
Raise the bounty on his head.

989
01:05:56,832 --> 01:05:58,542
25,000 crowns.

990
01:05:58,625 --> 01:06:00,085
Begging your pardon, sire.

991
01:06:00,169 --> 01:06:03,589
It won't do no good
how much you raise it.

992
01:06:03,672 --> 01:06:05,591
Really, scribe?
And why is that?

993
01:06:05,674 --> 01:06:08,093
Because, sire,
the poor, you see?

994
01:06:08,177 --> 01:06:10,596
He gives them
what he takes...

995
01:06:10,679 --> 01:06:13,515
and, well, sire,
they love him.

996
01:06:16,560 --> 01:06:18,020
Just a minute.

997
01:06:18,061 --> 01:06:21,440
Robin Hood steals money
from my pocket...

998
01:06:21,523 --> 01:06:23,942
forcing me
to hurt the public...

999
01:06:24,026 --> 01:06:26,486
and they love him for it?

1000
01:06:27,946 --> 01:06:29,198
Yes.

1001
01:06:30,532 --> 01:06:32,367
That's it, then!

1002
01:06:32,451 --> 01:06:35,329
Cancel the kitchen scraps
for lepers and orphans...

1003
01:06:35,370 --> 01:06:38,207
no more
merciful beheadings...

1004
01:06:38,290 --> 01:06:41,043
and call off Christmas.

1005
01:06:42,211 --> 01:06:43,712
The treasury is empty.

1006
01:06:43,795 --> 01:06:46,715
All day and all night,
people plague my door...

1007
01:06:46,798 --> 01:06:48,217
whining for tax relief...

1008
01:06:48,300 --> 01:06:50,719
and safe passage
through Sherwood Forest.

1009
01:06:50,802 --> 01:06:52,221
"We cannot pay thee...

1010
01:06:52,304 --> 01:06:53,722
what the highwayman
has taken."

1011
01:06:53,805 --> 01:06:55,724
It's the shortest route
to London.

1012
01:06:55,807 --> 01:06:59,811
It's the only road to London,
you little ferret.

1013
01:06:59,895 --> 01:07:02,814
Sir Guy's patrols
have found nothing, sire.

1014
01:07:02,898 --> 01:07:04,816
No camp. Nothing.

1015
01:07:04,900 --> 01:07:06,068
[Spits]

1016
01:07:06,151 --> 01:07:11,198
This hooded viper
simply slithers into the forest.

1017
01:07:11,281 --> 01:07:13,867
You, my room,
10:30 tonight.

1018
01:07:13,909 --> 01:07:15,827
You, 10:45...

1019
01:07:15,911 --> 01:07:17,579
and bring a friend.

1020
01:07:35,556 --> 01:07:37,432
A tongue offends thee.

1021
01:07:38,559 --> 01:07:39,560
Whose?

1022
01:07:39,601 --> 01:07:41,436
One who rights all.

1023
01:07:42,437 --> 01:07:45,315
One who...

1024
01:07:45,399 --> 01:07:47,442
That horrible little scribe?

1025
01:07:47,526 --> 01:07:49,611
- His tongue?
- Cut it out.

1026
01:07:58,912 --> 01:08:00,706
#What's the pleasure
in this life #

1027
01:08:00,789 --> 01:08:02,875
# Laughter, love,
and drinking #

1028
01:08:02,958 --> 01:08:04,626
# Good King Richard,
bless his soul #

1029
01:08:04,710 --> 01:08:06,545
# Loves his wine
and warring #

1030
01:08:06,628 --> 01:08:08,505
# But for us
who stay at home #

1031
01:08:08,589 --> 01:08:10,799
#There's only beer
and whoring #

1032
01:08:10,883 --> 01:08:12,593
# Play your music,
dance the day #

1033
01:08:12,634 --> 01:08:14,678
#Think of not
tomorrow... #

1034
01:08:19,057 --> 01:08:20,350
How many?

1035
01:08:20,434 --> 01:08:21,894
20.

1036
01:08:21,977 --> 01:08:23,270
20?

1037
01:08:23,312 --> 01:08:25,230
How many?

1038
01:08:26,732 --> 01:08:27,900
Five.

1039
01:08:29,484 --> 01:08:31,320
They can't count anyway.

1040
01:08:31,361 --> 01:08:33,697
- Come on.
- Why scare them?

1041
01:08:33,780 --> 01:08:36,658
And they call me barbarian.

1042
01:08:36,700 --> 01:08:38,493
# Loves his wine
and warring #

1043
01:08:38,577 --> 01:08:40,329
# But for us
who stay at home #

1044
01:08:40,412 --> 01:08:42,831
#There's only beer
and whoring #

1045
01:08:42,915 --> 01:08:45,667
# Play the music,
dance the day... ##

1046
01:08:45,709 --> 01:08:48,170
Friar! You'll find
it difficult to sing...

1047
01:08:48,253 --> 01:08:51,173
with a sword
in your gullet.

1048
01:08:51,256 --> 01:08:53,175
Yes, my lord.

1049
01:08:54,801 --> 01:08:55,969
You pig.

1050
01:08:56,011 --> 01:08:57,513
Shut up about it!

1051
01:08:57,554 --> 01:08:59,014
Help me move this log!

1052
01:08:59,056 --> 01:09:00,349
Log? This is a tree!

1053
01:09:00,432 --> 01:09:01,850
You're supposed to help me!

1054
01:09:01,892 --> 01:09:04,353
I'm supposed to be
meeting a girl!

1055
01:09:11,068 --> 01:09:13,028
You men in front, after me.

1056
01:09:13,070 --> 01:09:16,698
You men in the rear,
stay with the wagon!

1057
01:09:17,991 --> 01:09:19,535
On to glory!

1058
01:09:19,618 --> 01:09:22,663
Ha ha ha ha ha!

1059
01:09:33,882 --> 01:09:36,093
Bastards!
Come on, find them!

1060
01:09:46,979 --> 01:09:48,689
# Oh... ##

1061
01:10:09,251 --> 01:10:10,210
[Burp]

1062
01:10:10,252 --> 01:10:11,545
Go!

1063
01:10:11,587 --> 01:10:12,838
Hyah!

1064
01:10:12,921 --> 01:10:14,131
Hyah!

1065
01:10:21,305 --> 01:10:23,599
Welcome to Sherwood,
Friar. Giddyup!

1066
01:10:45,454 --> 01:10:46,622
Aagh!

1067
01:10:48,498 --> 01:10:52,920
- Hey, hey, hey!
- Surrender your weapons!

1068
01:10:52,961 --> 01:10:54,963
Surrender your weapons
and I'll give you my word...

1069
01:10:55,047 --> 01:10:56,924
you shall go free!

1070
01:10:56,965 --> 01:10:58,175
Don't do that!

1071
01:11:00,302 --> 01:11:01,803
Aah! What are you...

1072
01:11:02,638 --> 01:11:05,432
Azeem! Aah!

1073
01:11:18,153 --> 01:11:19,488
Look at that!
Oh!

1074
01:11:19,571 --> 01:11:22,074
I'll be buggered.

1075
01:11:22,157 --> 01:11:24,076
This treasure had a purpose.

1076
01:11:24,159 --> 01:11:26,078
We must find out what.

1077
01:11:26,161 --> 01:11:28,080
Oh! Aah!

1078
01:11:40,926 --> 01:11:43,345
Good morning,
my reverend friend.

1079
01:11:43,387 --> 01:11:45,347
You travel
with poor company...

1080
01:11:45,389 --> 01:11:48,350
when you travel with
Nottingham soldiers.

1081
01:11:48,392 --> 01:11:50,018
Tax him!

1082
01:11:50,102 --> 01:11:52,187
- Tax him!
- Tax him!

1083
01:11:52,271 --> 01:11:53,689
I'm Robin of Locksley...

1084
01:11:53,772 --> 01:11:56,316
and my men are thirsty.

1085
01:11:56,358 --> 01:11:58,110
- Aye!
- That's right.

1086
01:11:58,193 --> 01:11:59,319
Robin Hood!

1087
01:11:59,403 --> 01:12:04,241
Ha! Lord bless me.

1088
01:12:04,324 --> 01:12:07,536
I mistook you
for common thieves.

1089
01:12:07,619 --> 01:12:09,538
Kindly let me pass, huh?

1090
01:12:09,621 --> 01:12:12,040
Surely the lord
has the charity...

1091
01:12:12,124 --> 01:12:14,501
to spare a few barrels...

1092
01:12:14,543 --> 01:12:16,253
for good Christian men, yes?

1093
01:12:16,336 --> 01:12:18,172
We have much to celebrate.

1094
01:12:18,213 --> 01:12:19,798
Come on.

1095
01:12:19,882 --> 01:12:24,052
If you wish them to share
in the good lord's brew...

1096
01:12:24,094 --> 01:12:26,096
you must best me for it!

1097
01:12:26,180 --> 01:12:27,389
Hyah!

1098
01:12:32,060 --> 01:12:33,478
Confess, Robin Hood...

1099
01:12:33,562 --> 01:12:37,482
that Friar Tuck is a braver,
holier, and wiser man...

1100
01:12:37,566 --> 01:12:39,902
than thou art.

1101
01:12:56,001 --> 01:12:59,796
He giveth
and he taketh away.

1102
01:13:04,426 --> 01:13:05,886
Do you yield?

1103
01:13:10,432 --> 01:13:13,018
I'd rather roast in hell.

1104
01:13:13,101 --> 01:13:14,478
Aah!

1105
01:13:15,771 --> 01:13:17,523
Shoot him! Shoot him!

1106
01:13:19,233 --> 01:13:20,859
# Robin has his way #

1107
01:13:20,943 --> 01:13:23,195
#Whether you live
by night or day #

1108
01:13:23,278 --> 01:13:25,614
#Whether you're rich
or young or old #

1109
01:13:25,656 --> 01:13:27,658
#Whether you're noble,
meek, or bold #

1110
01:13:27,741 --> 01:13:30,202
#You will fall #

1111
01:13:30,285 --> 01:13:32,371
# Short or tall ##

1112
01:13:32,454 --> 01:13:37,501
Oh, I think the good friar's
taken us far enough.

1113
01:13:37,584 --> 01:13:38,836
Well done, Friar.

1114
01:13:38,919 --> 01:13:42,714
Thank you, Lord,
for teaching me humility.

1115
01:13:42,798 --> 01:13:44,758
Ohh.

1116
01:13:51,139 --> 01:13:52,432
Well, Tuck...

1117
01:13:52,474 --> 01:13:53,892
Thanks for the beer.

1118
01:13:53,976 --> 01:13:56,895
Are these not
the meek of the earth?

1119
01:13:56,979 --> 01:14:00,941
We're in need of an honest man
to minister to them.

1120
01:14:01,024 --> 01:14:02,526
What say you, Friar?

1121
01:14:06,488 --> 01:14:09,908
The Lord reveals himself
in mysterious ways.

1122
01:14:12,160 --> 01:14:13,287
I accept.

1123
01:14:13,370 --> 01:14:14,413
Good.

1124
01:14:14,496 --> 01:14:16,707
You will not regret it.

1125
01:14:16,790 --> 01:14:18,959
Aye, but you may!
