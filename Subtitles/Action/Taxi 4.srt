1
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:40,600
TAXI 4

2
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:49,640
Alright.

3
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:50,960
Are we finally leaving?

4
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,520
A suspect has been
located in the hotel.

5
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:55,360
But don't worry Mr. Martinez,
your client is perfectly safe.

6
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:57,400
I've assigned my best
people to the operation.

7
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:02,160
Gibert calling Alan.

8
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:04,440
/You've reached the police.
/Please wait on the line.

9
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:05,400
I've located the suspect.

10
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:07,400
Distance...
About 15 meters.

11
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:09,320
- Join me.
- Right away, boss.

12
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:11,240
Concentrate, Alan.

13
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:14,000
Do you see the suspect,
at 11 o'clock?

14
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:16,840
No, "at 11 o'clock"
is a term used in the navy.

15
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:19,800
You've been in Marseille for 10 years
and I bet you haven't seen the sea.

16
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:22,160
Actually I have, when making
my rounds at the port.

17
00:01:22,195 --> 00:01:23,080
Fine.

18
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:27,440
At 12 o'clock is straight ahead
and at 11 o'clock is this way.

19
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:28,680
Straight and to the left.

20
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:31,440
Ah yes, indeed.

21
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:35,720
Are you sure this is the suspect?
I think it's rather a hotel maid.

22
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:36,400
But of course.

23
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:38,280
Do you think a terrorist
moves around yelling

24
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:39,840
and wearing an explosive belt?

25
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:41,480
- No.
- Exactly.

26
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:43,760
They disguise themselves.

27
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:47,000
And is there a better disguise than
a hotel maid pushing a cart?

28
00:01:47,035 --> 00:01:48,240
- I'm asking you.
- Sure.

29
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:49,920
Especially in a hotel.

30
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:52,400
Do you hear the song
that rat is humming

31
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:53,520
to give himself courage?

32
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:56,000
Ah yes.
Is that Spanish?

33
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:58,360
That's a revolutionary song,
my little Alan.

34
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:09,160
On my command
neutralize the Basque.

35
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,120
Roger that.

36
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:13,160
At 12 o'clock!

37
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:15,880
/And we're done!

38
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:17,280
Let that nightingale sing.

39
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:19,000
Put him in a cage.
I'll question him later.

40
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,080
Go!

41
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:25,000
Gibert, how's it going?

42
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:27,800
Mr. Prefect, I've just neutralized
the Spanish terrorist.

43
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,760
He was transporting
a set of little bottles.

44
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:31,360
Most likely toxic substances

45
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:32,480
/he was going to spread.

46
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:33,400
I'll have it tested.

47
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:34,440
/Excellent, Gibert.

48
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:36,080
/And now take care
/of our client,

49
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:37,720
because we can't allow
ourselves to be late.

50
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:39,120
Consider it done, Mr. Prefect.

51
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:43,360
Emilien, the coast is clear.
You can deliver the package.

52
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:44,960
Emilien?

53
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,080
Emilien, answer right away!

54
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,600
I'm practically standing
in the exit door.

55
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,920
We can't do this while
I'm on a special mission.

56
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:53,080
It's not my fault.

57
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:55,280
You look so handsome when
you're on a special mission.

58
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:57,200
You look like Sean Connery
and you turn me on.

59
00:02:57,235 --> 00:02:58,160
Sean Connery...

60
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:59,400
Please, don't make fun of me.

61
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:01,000
You enjoy this
because you're stronger.

62
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:02,880
Alright, you can tie
me up next time.

63
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:04,880
Not so loud.
The hotel is bugged.

64
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:07,000
Yes sir, inspector.

65
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:09,200
I'll take care of the package,
and you find Gibert.

66
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,280
I love you, Emilien.

67
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:17,000
I love you too, Petra.
But this isn't the time.

68
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,640
See you at home tonight.

69
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:25,080
Mr. Cissé?

70
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:28,680
Mr. Cissé, we need to end the interview,
to be on the pitch in 20 minutes.

71
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:37,040
I'm sorry to disturb you
but I'm from the police and...

72
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:38,480
What's your name?

73
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:39,280
Emilien.

74
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:43,960
No, this isn't about...
This is about...

75
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:44,600
/Emilien!

76
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,720
This isn't the time
to exchange business cards.

77
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:47,800
/Where is that...

78
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:51,560
What a name.
Damn foreigner.

79
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:53,040
That's Djibril Cissé, sir.

80
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:53,600
Excuse me?

81
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:56,960
Don't get wise with me or I'll check
your papers and have you deported.

82
00:03:58,320 --> 00:03:59,200
Emilien, look.

83
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:00,360
They don't look alike.

84
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,800
/The nose, the teeth.

85
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:04,440
But it's certainly him,
I assure you.

86
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:05,760
/Not so fast, Emilien.

87
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:07,160
/I know about deception.

88
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,880
I worked for 2 years in customs,
so I saw plenty of impostors.

89
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:12,880
For example that Korean subsidiary in 82.
I smoked them out.

90
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:15,040
- But he's not Korean.
- How can you be sure?

91
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:16,120
I checked his papers.

92
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:19,160
- His eyes are a bit slanted.
- That's because he's tired.

93
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:21,480
We have to go or the Prefect
will grow impatient.

94
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:22,000
Yes.

95
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:23,520
Head to the car!

96
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:31,720
I don't know what you did to them,
but you aren't popular here.

97
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:39,360
Don't worry.
He doesn't know anything about soccer.

98
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:40,400
His passion is fishing.

99
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:42,000
What are you mumbling, Emilien?

100
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:44,000
I just said that
your passion is fishing.

101
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,600
Fishing is a real sport.

102
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:47,000
Do you ever fill
a fishing net?

103
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,280
No, my job is to put
the ball in the goal net.

104
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:52,280
That's good.
Because fishing isn't for amateurs.

105
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:56,080
For example consider float fishing,
on the lakeside.

106
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:59,240
Sometimes you have to
stand motionless for 8 hours

107
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:00,360
/observing the float.

108
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:01,120
/And then...

109
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:09,720
What's going on?

110
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:11,000
Are you OK?
Break anything?

111
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:12,080
No.
I'm fine.

112
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:14,960
Couldn't you have turned
on the signal?

113
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:17,280
We were told Mr. Cissé
is having a siesta at the hotel,

114
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:18,360
so we avoided waking him.

115
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:19,600
He's not having a siesta.

116
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:21,680
He's in my car
and he's being transferred.

117
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:24,400
Djibril Cissé is being transferred?
He'll play for Marseille?

118
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:26,120
It's Cissé.

119
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:30,040
Do something or we'll be late.

120
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:31,040
Don't worry.

121
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:32,960
I know someone who'll
get us out of here.

122
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:38,600
You have taxis in the police?

123
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:40,400
No, he rather belongs
to the Air Force.

124
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:44,720
Marseille Express at your service.

125
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:45,880
Daniel, no time for jokes.

126
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:48,200
Mr. Cissé has to be at
the Vélodrome in 10 minutes.

127
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,080
Mr. Djibril.

128
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:51,325
Nice to have you.
Will you be playing in Marseille?

129
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,640
I'm taking part in a charity match
and I'm going to be late.

130
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,120
Since it's for a good cause.

131
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:18,360
I'll change clothes in the car,
to gain some time.

132
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:19,280
You can always try.

133
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:24,920
Mom, you'll never believe
who's going to play for Marseille.

134
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:29,440
That's not the right way.
We're leaving Marseille.

135
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:31,200
We'll go around to
avoid the traffic jams.

136
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:46,240
I assure you, Djibril Cissé,
no. 9, playing for Olympique de Marseille.

137
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,720
Now this is a road.

138
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:51,720
Real driving.

139
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
We can't hear the engine.

140
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:54,720
At this speed all
we hear is the wind.

141
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,720
This just in.

142
00:06:56,760 --> 00:07:02,280
Olympique de Marseille has acquired
an exceptional player, Djibril Cissé.

143
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:09,480
/A speeding white taxi
/will be there in 1 minute.

144
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:10,760
Roger that.

145
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,440
It must be our
little Daniel.

146
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:15,480
At his speed
we have no chance.

147
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:17,960
- Shall we send the new guy?
- Damn. Are you kidding?

148
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,800
What's wrong?
He's new, let him learn.

149
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:21,640
/Hey, new guy?

150
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:22,480
Yes, boss?

151
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:24,000
Stand next to the radar

152
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:26,720
and set it to "extra sensitive".

153
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:28,320
- Alright?
- Yes, sir.

154
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,960
Attention, here comes
the TGV train.

155
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,480
/Step away from the platform.

156
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:40,720
Thanks, kid.

157
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:41,400
/You did well.

158
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:43,600
The measurement is more effective
on "extra sensitive".

159
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,040
Your taxi is quite fast.

160
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:50,320
I have my tricks.

161
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,760
I recovered some parts from
the Concorde, when it was scrapped.

162
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,400
Slow down, I don't want
to miss the exit.

163
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:55,600
I've just received confirmation.

164
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:59,320
The Marseille club has made the transfer
of the year for 60 million euro.

165
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,040
All the spots are full.

166
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:11,200
Drive to the underground parking.
I know it like my pocket.

167
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:13,320
I'm not sure why, but I worry
when you say that.

168
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,560
Djibril Cissé's arrival
to Olympique de Marseille

169
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:21,680
is fueling rumors and insane amounts
of money are being mentioned.

170
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:23,120
To find out more,

171
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:26,480
we'll go live to our reporter
at the Vélodrome stadium.

172
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:30,520
I'm coming to you live from
Marseille for this friendly match

173
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:32,760
being played for the
Association of Sick Children.

174
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,520
And maybe that's why the players
have demanded insane amounts,

175
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:40,360
since there is talk of
a contract worth 200 million euro.

176
00:08:40,395 --> 00:08:42,800
/We'll invite him to
/the microphone of TF1,

177
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:45,005
/but until now the star
/has failed to arrive.

178
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:47,800
Cissé or not, if he's not here
in a minute, I'm starting the match.

179
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:54,120
Try taking a right here.

180
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:56,000
Emilien, we've taken a right
here twice already.

181
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:57,760
Are you sure you know it
like your pocket?

182
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:00,080
Yes. I was responsible for
security during the pope's visit.

183
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:02,160
We spent 6 days here looking
for Gibert, who got lost.

184
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,240
That sounds promising.

185
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:05,680
I don't know the parking,
but I'll trust my intuition.

186
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:08,560
We're starting.

187
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:18,800
7 minutes and 32 seconds.

188
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:19,640
Thanks for the ride.

189
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:20,680
Thanks for the show.

190
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,720
We have a better view
here than on TV.

191
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:43,400
But you're in the
middle of the pitch.

192
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:46,320
Take a seat in the stands
or it's a yellow card.

193
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:47,480
Of course, Mr. referee.

194
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:05,600
What an idiot.

195
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:26,280
- Foul.
- He's on crutches.

196
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:37,080
- Free kick.
- What's his problem?

197
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:28,280
Warm up and stretch your legs.
I don't want any injuries during play.

198
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,080
Do you like the shirt?

199
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:43,080
Yes, but it's too big.

200
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,400
You'll ask mom to wash it.

201
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:47,080
It'll shrink and be
the right size.

202
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,440
The logo will come off.

203
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,720
I'll ask mom to wash
around the logo.

204
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:51,840
Listen to me.

205
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:53,960
I'd like to see you play
longer than 3 minutes,

206
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,440
so no red card, OK?

207
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:56,280
OK.

208
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:58,040
Go.

209
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:01,160
The first rule is that you
never touch the ball, OK?

210
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:01,640
OK.

211
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:04,360
And if someone passes you the ball,
kick it right away.

212
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:05,080
Which way?

213
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:07,320
Don't worry about that.
Kick it and let the others worry.

214
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:09,480
Could I finally get
to play soccer?

215
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:11,320
Daddy will play
with you later.

216
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:14,520
Go, my son.

217
00:12:14,555 --> 00:12:15,120
Go.

218
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:17,000
And don't run too fast.

219
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:28,280
Are you sure he won't
catch a cold?

220
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:28,920
Don't worry.

221
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,440
I gave him a heated shirt
and plenty of vitamin C this morning.

222
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:33,160
Then he's really
in no danger.

223
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:35,960
You should have signed him up for hockey,
to amortize the equipment.

224
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,600
Are you nuts?
That's too dangerous.

225
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:39,280
His mother wanted him
to take up karate.

226
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:41,120
But luckily I have the
file of the club manager.

227
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:43,040
He accepted to refuse him,
without Petra knowing.

228
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:44,720
Emilien, he'll be at risk
his whole life.

229
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:46,040
So he better get
used to it.

230
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:47,680
Yes, but that can wait.

231
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:48,880
What about swimming?

232
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:49,600
No.

233
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:51,480
His bronchi are too frail.
It's hereditary.

234
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:54,080
And you never broke anything
when you were little?

235
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:55,480
Yes, my arm.
3 times.

236
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:56,200
See.

237
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:58,080
But that didn't
make me any smarter

238
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:00,120
or get me a place
at the police academy.

239
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:02,840
Maybe you'd have been
better off breaking a leg.

240
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:07,400
Very good, my son!

241
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:11,840
Who will our kids
grow up to be?

242
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:13,360
What?

243
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:16,160
Do you think mine will be
a cab driver, and yours a cop?

244
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:16,880
Why not?

245
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:18,360
That's nothing bad.

246
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:20,680
We both help others.
That's beautiful in itself.

247
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,640
It could be worse.
It could be the exact opposite.

248
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:24,600
Mine a cab driver,
and yours a cop.

249
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,160
Don't mention such misfortune.

250
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:32,720
Emilien, yes?

251
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,240
Emilien?

252
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:36,760
What urgent matter?

253
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:39,480
Gibert told you that?
But I'm not working today.

254
00:13:39,515 --> 00:13:39,960
Emilien?

255
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:41,400
Are you alright Maxim?

256
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:42,640
No, that's not possible.

257
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:43,680
Emilien, you'd better...

258
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,200
Alright.
I'm coming.

259
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:47,800
Daniel, Gibert is summoning everyone
for an urgent matter.

260
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:49,960
Can you take care of Maxim?
Petra is on a secret mission.

261
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,280
I can't call her.
And my mother is on a pilgrimage to Lourdes.

262
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:52,920
To Lourdes?

263
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:54,560
She goes there every year
since my birth.

264
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:55,880
Such a miracle
must be celebrated.

265
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:58,200
- Take my stuff to the station after the game.
- No problem.

266
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:00,280
Just don't take them
to the port for sweets.

267
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:00,760
Sure.

268
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:03,320
They'll get a slice of bread,
a cup of water and go to bed.

269
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:04,560
I'm kidding.

270
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:05,160
Go.

271
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:06,440
I'll take care of him
like my own.

272
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:07,400
That's what I'm afraid of.

273
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:09,800
Emilien, your son visits
me every Wednesday.

274
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:12,640
And he's never complained.
He never returns with warts on his face.

275
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:13,080
No.

276
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:14,680
So get moving
and go to work.

277
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:15,280
OK.

278
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:19,440
4 minutes and 30 seconds without
a card is your record.

279
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:21,120
But I didn't do anything.

280
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:24,440
That referee gives out cards
to every promising player.

281
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:27,120
Go get Maxim.
I'll take you to the port.

282
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:28,800
Come on Max,
we're going to the port.

283
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:36,600
Stop that ball this instant!

284
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:38,200
I got it, boss.

285
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:39,960
Bring me that ball.

286
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:46,000
It won't piss me off anymore.

287
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:48,880
Here kids.
You can play on.

288
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:52,240
Alright, gentlemen...

289
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:56,760
This isn't the time for dribbling, footwork
or any other soccer nonsense.

290
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:58,280
I've talked on the
phone with Paris.

291
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:01,200
They're sending us
a very special package.

292
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:03,760
It's this year's
biggest transfer.

293
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:04,360
Drogba?

294
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:04,960
Thuram?

295
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,160
No, I know.
Makelele?

296
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:06,720
Beckenbauer?

297
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:07,440
Maradona?

298
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:09,200
You're a real
bunch of morons.

299
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:10,360
I'm not talking about tennis.

300
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:12,240
I'm talking about a criminal.

301
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:13,040
Tapie?

302
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:15,960
This one is even more famous.

303
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:18,440
According to his file,
he's public enemy no. 1.

304
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:20,040
/It's...

305
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:25,760
Boss...

306
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:28,680
That's yesterday's transfer.

307
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:30,520
So where's my paper?

308
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:33,000
It's written on the back.
You asked us to save paper.

309
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:33,800
Yes, that's true.

310
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:35,000
That was my wife's idea.

311
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:37,560
She saw a TV show about the destruction
of the Amazon forests.

312
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:40,800
Do you know how many acres
of forest are destroyed each day?

313
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,800
/- 3? 6?
/- I don't know.

314
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:44,480
How many?

315
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:48,840
If you knew,
it would make you shudder.

316
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:49,840
How many?

317
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:54,000
It's millions of matchboxes being
cut down and going up in flames.

318
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:56,320
So...
When the opportunity presents itself...

319
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:57,840
Respect your papers.

320
00:15:57,880 --> 00:16:00,440
Respect the paper.
Economize.

321
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:02,240
Boss, and that public enemy no. 1?

322
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:03,040
Yes...

323
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:04,440
He's a Belgian,

324
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:06,960
whose name I won't pronounce
because it makes me feel sick.

325
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,040
53 armed robberies.

326
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:10,760
/Accomplice to 122 murders.

327
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,640
/There hasn't been anyone
/worse since Al Capone.

328
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:14,720
He's being transferred to Congo,

329
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:16,760
where he'll be tried
in 10 criminal cases.

330
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,160
Transit in Marseille.

331
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:22,760
We take care of him from the time
of his arrival until 5 a. m. tomorrow.

332
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:25,400
And we put him on a plane
of the Congo authorities.

333
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:27,920
This Belgian won't have
the time to tour the city.

334
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:31,600
Surveillance must be ultra tight.

335
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:33,880
One police officer per square inch.

336
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:37,320
I want so many officers around him,
so that he can't see the sea.

337
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:38,720
Do you understand?

338
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:39,800
Yes, boss!

339
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,120
At what time is that monster
of the Ardennes flying in?

340
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:44,200
Good question, Emilien.

341
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:45,080
At exactly 3 p. m.

342
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:46,760
Boss, it's already 3:05.

343
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:48,400
It's 12:05 on mine.

344
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:51,680
Head to the cars!

345
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:54,280
Maxim, is this what
you ordered?

346
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:55,960
So why aren't you eating?

347
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,360
Because my dad says that such
a cake only gets you stains all over.

348
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:03,080
You'll show your dad that's not
the case and you won't stain yourself.

349
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:11,200
/Damn, your father.

350
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:12,160
Leo, hide under the table.

351
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:13,760
/What's this in the
/middle of the street?

352
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:15,280
Get out of the way.
Police.

353
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:16,560
She's caught a flat tire.

354
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:18,160
I can't leave her
alone in this heat.

355
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:19,120
He's right, boss.

356
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:20,080
She'll dehydrate.

357
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:21,120
We need to help her.

358
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:23,200
I'm a certified life guard.
I'll help her.

359
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:24,960
I was a florist
before being a cop.

360
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,680
Nobody move!

361
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:35,560
Isn't he ashamed?
He should be behind bars.

362
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:37,640
/How much time does it take
/to change a tire?

363
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:38,720
It doesn't take 3 hours.

364
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:40,760
Around here we
take our time.

365
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:43,440
Thank you.

366
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:44,680
Finally.

367
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:45,880
Go.

368
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:56,720
/Is the cake good at least?

369
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,840
- Mr. General.
- Gibert, explain yourself.

370
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:11,920
I'm sorry for being late.

371
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:14,120
We took a shortcut thru the port,
but caught a flat tire.

372
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,940
Does it take an hour
to change a tire?

373
00:18:15,975 --> 00:18:17,720
It now takes the
police a whole week.

374
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:19,320
The training of recruits
is getting worse.

375
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:20,720
They learn to shoot on day 1.

376
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:24,040
But between you and me,
we change tires more often than we shoot.

377
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:26,360
Do you have the same
problem in the army?

378
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:27,600
No.
We have caterpillars.

379
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:28,880
Caterpillars.
Very good.

380
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:29,920
They go everywhere.

381
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:01,280
That's funny.
This reminds me of my vacation in Africa.

382
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:03,680
They had the same cages
and we slept in them,

383
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:05,440
to protect ourselves
from the wild animals.

384
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:07,280
This animal is of
the worst kind, Gibert.

385
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:08,080
If it escapes,

386
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:11,080
it will burn down the city and kill
everyone before you change a tire.

387
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:12,640
Don't worry,
Mr. General.

388
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:14,800
We're used to such
characters in Marseille.

389
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:16,080
One day they're limping
on one leg,

390
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:18,000
and the next they're healthy
and playing soccer.

391
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:19,760
Load him up.

392
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:25,720
And we're done.

393
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:28,680
Gibert, be careful with this package.
Your career depends on it.

394
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:30,120
Don't worry, Mr. General.

395
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:31,480
Consider it done.

396
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:32,400
Let's sync our watches.

397
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:34,160
- 4:20.
- 12:05. Perfect.

398
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:35,440
We'll be in touch
every 2 hours.

399
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:36,800
Forward!

400
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:42,600
Hello, this is Gibert.

401
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:44,000
Mr. General.

402
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:44,680
Already?

403
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:45,480
Yes, already.

404
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:48,520
You've been gone 30 seconds,
and already you've made a blunder.

405
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:49,080
How so?

406
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:50,360
Look in the mirror.

407
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:52,640
A price tag.

408
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,720
Of course.
Now I see better.

409
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:55,840
Thank you, Mr. General.

410
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:59,720
Gibert, I meant the exterior mirror.

411
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:01,200
/Now look to your right.

412
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:04,000
Holy crap!

413
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:05,600
Stop the cars!

414
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:22,800
- Are you sure this is the place?
- I'm 100% sure.

415
00:20:22,835 --> 00:20:24,480
Alright, this is
what we'll do.

416
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:27,240
You'll stay in the car.
I'll be better off on my own.

417
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:29,480
And if...
And I emphasize the "if".

418
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:31,480
If I'm not back in 30 minutes,
come and get me.

419
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:32,480
OK, fine.

420
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:34,480
What?

421
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:37,560
Call me before
you let him out.

422
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:39,080
It'll be safer that way.

423
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:40,120
No problem.

424
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:50,160
Damn.
What a throw.

425
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:08,920
COMMISSIONAIRE GIBERT

426
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:26,960
OK.

427
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:28,600
Get to work, Serge.

428
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:33,600
Hi, Daniel.

429
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:36,360
I found this a mile down the road.
Does it belong to you?

430
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:38,800
Damn, I knew it had
rolled off somewhere.

431
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:39,600
Thanks.

432
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:41,880
- Hi, kids.
- They're growing up fast.

433
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:43,965
Hi, Maxim.
We know each other.

434
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,040
Luckily he doesn't
look like his dad.

435
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:47,720
OK, let's go.

436
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:49,560
Emilien hasn't returned yet.

437
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:51,640
No problem. I'll put them in
front of the computer.

438
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:55,200
Does your dad have anything
against video games?

439
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:58,120
Now you have something to do.

440
00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:59,840
I'll be gone 5 minutes.
I'll make a call.

441
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:00,800
Be good.

442
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:05,880
Is someone else using it?

443
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:08,800
No, they simply gave
my dad the worst computer.

444
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:10,600
You can barely
send an e-mail.

445
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:12,800
- And Gibert's computer?
- It's an atom bomb.

446
00:22:12,835 --> 00:22:13,360
SYSTEM ERROR

447
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:14,640
What's this mess?

448
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:15,880
Nothing works.

449
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:19,160
Why don't they make the
newer models more user-friendly?

450
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:21,680
Yes?

451
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:22,840
We want to use the computer.

452
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:24,800
The computer's already in use.

453
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:26,280
Why don't you go
to another office?

454
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:29,280
Because this computer is the
latest generation Extreme Core.

455
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:32,440
SYSTEM ERROR

456
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:34,520
Do you know how
to use this machine?

457
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:35,480
Kids' play.

458
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:38,000
Hi, Marley.

459
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:38,800
Hi.

460
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:40,840
Got anything for
a dry throat?

461
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
It's the end of the season
and I have little left.

462
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:44,400
Look in the closet.

463
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:46,360
HOLLAND.
MOROCCO.

464
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:47,240
COLUMBIA.

465
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,040
Indeed.

466
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:52,480
Should I roll 2?

467
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:54,200
Yeah, maybe I'll
finally wake up.

468
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:02,240
/Here.

469
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:06,160
Thanks, but I never smoke while on the job.
I'll smoke it at home.

470
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:07,840
That's funny.

471
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:10,560
Here it's the other way around.
We smoke at work but never at home.

472
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:12,880
Damn, it's Gibert.

473
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:14,120
Damn, the car...

474
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:24,440
OK, Alan...

475
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:26,960
Put the animal in
the big office.

476
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:29,040
- Should I get him out of the cage?
- Of course not.

477
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:31,800
Must I remind you that
this animal is extremely dangerous?

478
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:34,320
I know.
But this cage is extremely big.

479
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:35,720
Don't question my orders.

480
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:36,960
Execute.

481
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:42,240
To all units.

482
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:44,880
/The wolf is entering
/the sheep house.

483
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:46,320
Damn, it's Gibert.
Get rid of it.

484
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:04,360
Wait, Marley.
Come here.

485
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:05,560
/Come here.

486
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:06,800
Yes, Commissionaire?

487
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:08,800
Have you been smoking?

488
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:10,320
No.
I assure you.

489
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:12,160
Don't tell me stories.

490
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:14,320
I have an acute sense of smell,
my little Marley.

491
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:17,160
Last winter I had a 3-month
workshop with rescue dogs.

492
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:18,800
I sniffed a lot of snow.

493
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:19,920
I don't doubt it.

494
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:22,600
At the end of the workshop
I could smell drugs from a mile away.

495
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:23,720
Unreal...

496
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:24,680
Yes.

497
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:28,560
OK, I'll let you go this time.
But it better not happen again.

498
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:33,760
Type the password.

499
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:35,760
I type the password.

500
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:38,160
Upload the picture.

501
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:40,160
I upload the picture.

502
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:43,120
First you click the
picture you don't want.

503
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:45,320
First I click the
picture I don't want.

504
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:47,120
And you click the picture
you want to keep.

505
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:51,040
Thanks a lot, boys.

506
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:53,800
Without you I never
would have managed.

507
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:55,440
You deserve a little something.

508
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:58,800
A ticket.
Here you go.

509
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:04,400
Put it away.
It's our little secret.

510
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:06,320
What are you
doing here, kids?

511
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:09,200
I've told you not
to touch my computer.

512
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:09,840
Go.

513
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:13,760
And what are
you doing here?

514
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:15,640
I'm...

515
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:17,640
You're the new IT trainer?

516
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:20,680
That's right.

517
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:22,160
I'm sorry.
It slipped my mind.

518
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:25,000
The help of a trainer is a must
in case of these machines.

519
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:27,200
I'm rather talented when
it comes to electronics.

520
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:29,760
But I must admit that
I'm having a hard time.

521
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:31,680
OK, let's have a lesson today.

522
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:34,880
I had a hard day and I feel
my head is going to explode.

523
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:37,000
Excuse me...
But you're smoking.

524
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:38,840
No, I stopped
smoking 3 weeks ago.

525
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:42,600
I generally have a strong will
but this time I got a patch.

526
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:44,360
- See?
- It suits you.

527
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:47,400
But I meant you have smoke
coming out your head.

528
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:49,200
Yes, indeed.

529
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:50,520
- May I?
/- Be my guest.

530
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:53,240
Where did this come from?

531
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:55,800
This is from Morocco.

532
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:58,720
Put it out please.
This is a non-smoking office.

533
00:25:58,840 --> 00:25:59,640
I'm sorry.

534
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:03,680
OK, can we start the lesson?
I have also other things to do.

535
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:06,360
Of course. Where did you
finish last lesson?

536
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:07,520
At adjusting the chair.

537
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,120
Grab the mouse.

538
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:16,040
One eye on the monitor,
and the other on the keyboard.

539
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:27,480
This won't be easy.

540
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:31,680
Are you sure this is
for kids under 6?

541
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:33,480
Dad, this game is super soft.

542
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,680
We haven't played it for years.

543
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:37,920
Daniel...

544
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:40,320
You'll never imagine what
a difficult case I've been given.

545
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:42,520
It's widely known
I have no imagination.

546
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:45,320
They've sent us an important client.
A very important client.

547
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:47,680
- That is?
- He's wanted by every police in Europe.

548
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:48,600
And they sent him here?

549
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:50,520
That's good.
He can play some boules.

550
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:51,440
He won't have time.

551
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:53,680
Tomorrow at 5 a. m. we'll
put him on a plane to Congo.

552
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:55,120
/If he doesn't escape
/in the meantime.

553
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:57,480
I don't want to make fun of you,
but this isn't a police station.

554
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:58,480
It's an amusement center.

555
00:26:58,520 --> 00:26:59,280
Exactly, Daniel.

556
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:03,960
Gibert has summoned everyone
and I have to do overtime.

557
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:07,360
I've called Petra
but she doesn't answer.

558
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:09,480
She's still on that
damn secret mission.

559
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:11,120
So I'm left with
the kid and...

560
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:14,240
You'd like your friend
Daniel to take care of him.

561
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,160
For 2 or 3 hours until
I'm off duty.

562
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:19,160
I'll pick him up
after duty.

563
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:21,040
- Sugar?
- Yes.

564
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:24,760
When will I get to work?
I've been with the kids since this morning.

565
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:26,200
Your wife can't take of them?

566
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:28,080
She's in Paris at a
redecorating exposition.

567
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:29,320
She redecorates?

568
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:30,960
She only redecorates garages.

569
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
She's decided to
redecorate our garage.

570
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:35,400
- What a mess...
- That's right.

571
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:37,040
Even the taxi has
to stand outside.

572
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:37,960
Can you imagine?

573
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,480
- That's rough.
- Right.

574
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:42,400
But come to think of it...

575
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:45,000
It's better for the
taxi to stand outside.

576
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:46,320
She's putting flowers everywhere.

577
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:48,480
/The flower pollen is
/damaging everything.

578
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:51,120
I spend the weekends cleaning
everything with cotton swabs.

579
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:54,160
When living with someone you
need to learn to compromise.

580
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:56,120
And what compromises have
you arrived at with Petra?

581
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:57,360
A whole bunch.

582
00:27:58,200 --> 00:27:58,880
For example?

583
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:00,200
For example, my personal things.

584
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:02,720
When I was single
my things were a mess.

585
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:06,160
And when Petra saw a shirt lying around
she'd throw it out the window.

586
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:08,240
- Your boxers too?
- Everything, I'm telling you.

587
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:10,960
What did you do?
Did you learn to clean up?

588
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:12,760
Exactly.
And I bought a fishing rod.

589
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,520
I don't have to go
down 3 floors to get my stuff.

590
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:20,080
When do you want to
pick up your kid?

591
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:21,600
I'll be off duty
in 2 hours.

592
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:23,240
OK.
Go for 2 hours.

593
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:25,120
You're a real pal, Daniel.

594
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:25,880
Yeah, I know.

595
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:30,320
Tell me.

596
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:32,480
/Since it'll be the 4
/of us without the wives,

597
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:34,640
how about some pizza
and TV at my garage?

598
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:35,680
Before the shop closes.

599
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:36,480
Sold.

600
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:40,120
Tell me.

601
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:41,880
What will you do with them
during those 2 hours?

602
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:42,880
I have an idea.

603
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:45,160
/Grandpa!

604
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:46,800
Kids!

605
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:48,640
/It's so nice
/to see you.

606
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,400
You were supposed
to come on Sunday.

607
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:53,080
I know, but we were going to the movies
and they saw your house,

608
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:54,680
and started to scream
wanting to see you.

609
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:56,840
Yes, grandpa.
I missed you so much.

610
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:58,320
I want to stay with Leo.

611
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,200
My sweet angels.

612
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:02,400
I'm here.
Grandpa is here.

613
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:03,640
/Don't worry.

614
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:05,200
They're so sensitive.

615
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:07,040
Their mothers are
out of town.

616
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:08,280
/They act like tough guys,

617
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:10,080
but in fact
they're soft-hearted.

618
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:13,400
Can I keep them for
a couple of hours?

619
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:14,760
/So that they can calm down.

620
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:18,440
But not more than 2 hours,
Mr. General.

621
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:19,520
/They have homework to do.

622
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:20,440
2 hours.

623
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:21,280
Starting now.

624
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:30,520
He's been gone an hour.
Shall we go get him?

625
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:32,320
We'll wait another 5 minutes
and then we'll go.

626
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:33,680
/Up.

627
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:34,600
That's it.

628
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:36,320
And now down.
Faster.

629
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:37,480
Faster...

630
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:39,520
Up.

631
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:40,845
See.
It's not so hard.

632
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:42,760
/The most important is
/to keep a steady pace.

633
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:43,400
Boss!

634
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:45,680
Alan, you made me lose.

635
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,120
/How many points
/did I score?

636
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:47,800
8.

637
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:49,600
Not bad for a first time.

638
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:51,520
/What's the record?

639
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:53,320
/The record is...

640
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:55,520
/20 million, 653 thousand.

641
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:57,680
- May I?
- Be my guest.

642
00:29:58,160 --> 00:29:58,720
Hello?

643
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:00,240
It's me.
Shall we come and get you?

644
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:02,560
No, there's no need.
I'm done here.

645
00:30:02,595 --> 00:30:03,440
/I'll be there soon.

646
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:04,640
OK, fine.

647
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:05,480
And?

648
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:06,520
He's fine.

649
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:08,600
Excuse me, but I have to go.

650
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:09,400
Already?

651
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:11,400
Another client is
waiting for me.

652
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:13,800
Next month at the same hour.

653
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:14,920
With great pleasure.

654
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:28,560
Alan, what did you do?
Are you completely nuts?

655
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:30,720
You gave an order to put
him in the big office.

656
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:32,840
And orders shouldn't be questioned.

657
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,200
That's true.
You did well, my little Alan.

658
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:44,080
Take off the cover.
He won't stand here all dressed up.

659
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:53,080
He's impressive.

660
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:55,680
Is he really that dangerous?

661
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:56,640
He's even worse.

662
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:58,920
He can slit a sheep's
throat with his ears.

663
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:00,920
Don't be afraid,
my little Emilien.

664
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:03,640
I spent 5 years in Equatorial Guyana,
eating fried spiders

665
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:05,560
and counting hippos for UNESCO.

666
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:07,680
So I won't be scared of
some Belgian, believe me.

667
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:12,920
We'll start with a routine interrogation.
That'll calm him down.

668
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:14,400
Alan, get me the papers.

669
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:16,000
Go ahead, Alan.

670
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:21,160
First and last name!

671
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:25,000
So?
How'd it go?

672
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:27,000
The place is a nuthouse,
I swear.

673
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:29,040
It gives me the creeps.

674
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:30,440
Come on, go.

675
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:38,120
You want to play
the wise guy?

676
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:39,560
Alan, the Bouches-du-Rhône department.

677
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:41,160
- Bouches-du-Rhône?
- Yes, Bouches-du-Rhône.

678
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:41,880
Sure, boss.

679
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:43,840
You'll see.

680
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:46,360
Will you answer?

681
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:51,440
Stay calm!

682
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:54,520
You still want to
play the wise guy?

683
00:31:54,555 --> 00:31:55,240
Alright.

684
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:57,320
Alan, there's a hunting
rifle in my desk.

685
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:58,120
You'll see.

686
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:02,480
I brought it back from Guyana.
A gift from the head of the reserve.

687
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:05,160
This dart will put an elephant
to sleep in 5 seconds.

688
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:07,320
/OK, Alan.
/Careful, it's loaded.

689
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:08,200
/Keep him at gunpoint.

690
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:10,480
If he tries to escape,
fire at him.

691
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:11,640
Without a warning shot?

692
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:13,160
Of course.
There's only one dart.

693
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:15,200
What will you use to
put him to sleep?

694
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:17,160
All the better for me.

695
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:19,720
Let's continue the interrogation.

696
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:20,920
First and last name.

697
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,200
What's that?

698
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:24,840
He's starting to
piss me off.

699
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:27,960
Don't piss me off.
You don't want to see me pissed off.

700
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,440
Boss, it must be hard for him to
talk with a ball in his mouth.

701
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:33,400
That's just an excuse.
If he wanted to, he'd talk.

702
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:35,000
Look, boss.

703
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:36,720
He's trying to say something.

704
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:38,240
Let him say it.
That's all we're asking.

705
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:41,320
Boss, what if we take the
ball out of his mouth?

706
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:42,080
Not a chance.

707
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:43,640
Give an arm,
he'll take a finger.

708
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:45,880
That's what this
little blackboard is for.

709
00:32:45,915 --> 00:32:46,800
There's a blackboard?

710
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:47,840
Yeah, have a look.

711
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:49,320
And there's chalk on a chain.

712
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:50,560
This allows him to communicate.

713
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:51,200
Very good.

714
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:52,320
He'll answer us in writing.

715
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:54,080
Emilien, write
"first and last name".

716
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:56,720
Boss, he can't talk but
he can hear us very well.

717
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:00,240
Give him the chalk.

718
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:02,640
But be careful he doesn't
bite your leg off.

719
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:05,520
/Go ahead, Emilien.

720
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:14,480
Slowly.

721
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:22,000
/Very good, Emilien.

722
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,040
PEE

723
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:32,160
What did he write?

724
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:37,040
- Pee.
- Pee?

725
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:37,960
That's right.

726
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,880
I understand, but is that
his first or last name?

727
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:41,840
Boss, I think he wants
to go to the bathroom.

728
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:45,240
He's not going anywhere.

729
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:48,160
That trick "I'll go to the
bathroom and run away",

730
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:49,840
I've seen it a hundred times.

731
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:52,800
He thinks he'll trick us
with such an old stunt.

732
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:54,520
Are you kidding me?

733
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:56,960
There must be something prepared
for such an eventuality.

734
00:33:58,040 --> 00:33:59,160
Look over there.

735
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:01,560
Look where?

736
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:06,200
Emilien, do you know
how this works?

737
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:08,000
Of course.
It's kids' play.

738
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:09,920
This is the drain pipe.

739
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:11,480
And this one is for cleaning.
Simple.

740
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:13,960
They showed us a training video
about new equipment a month ago.

741
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:14,960
Right, Alan?

742
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:15,760
Never mind.

743
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:17,000
Hook him up.

744
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:19,480
And you keep
him at gunpoint!

745
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:27,560
Try this and tell
me what you think.

746
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:40,520
This stuff is strong.
I'm already seeing huge worms.

747
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:44,120
This connects to the water tap.

748
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:47,960
And this is placed
in the toilet.

749
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:51,280
Done.

750
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:52,560
That was easy.

751
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:54,200
I hooked up the pipes...

752
00:34:55,680 --> 00:34:57,160
Alan, give me that.

753
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:58,480
I'm sorry, man.

754
00:34:58,520 --> 00:35:00,920
- I wasn't focused.
- Then focus a little, Alan.

755
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:03,920
We're at a police station so
you can't go around waving a weapon.

756
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:06,240
And we have no experience
in shooting at bears.

757
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:09,320
This thing is used
to shoot at bears.

758
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:11,400
You have to be careful
in an office.

759
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:13,240
One finger on the safety catch,

760
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:15,760
while keeping the weapon
close to the body, like this.

761
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:20,200
My foot.

762
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:25,440
There's a chair here.

763
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:28,000
Lay him down.

764
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:29,840
He weighs as much as
a couple of people.

765
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:32,360
Damn...
Look at him.

766
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:34,160
He looks like he
smoked some carpet.

767
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:36,440
No, it's some stuff
for bears.

768
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:37,280
For bears?

769
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:38,280
You gave him that.

770
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:39,920
I didn't give him anything.

771
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:40,880
No, you morons.

772
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:43,880
He shot himself with
a sleeping dart for bears.

773
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:46,600
We have to wake him or he'll
hibernate for 6 months.

774
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:48,240
Consider that...
6 months of peace...

775
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:50,760
And who will sign
the vacations?

776
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:54,080
- Get up!
- Wake up!

777
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:56,000
General alarm!

778
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:01,760
Where were we?

779
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:04,080
We were at first
and last name.

780
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:06,240
Have you become as
stupid as Gibert?

781
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:07,600
I'm sorry.

782
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:10,840
I spend the whole day with him
so it's starting to rub off.

783
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:13,680
Are you OK Belgian?
Did you take a leak?

784
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:16,320
Did you play
"white men can't piss"?

785
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:18,680
That was funny.

786
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:20,720
"White men can't piss".

787
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:23,680
OK, enough.

788
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:26,920
That must have been a big pee.
See how his legs have swollen?

789
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:27,880
But that's not normal.

790
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:30,880
It should go
out the drain pipe.

791
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:32,800
But water is flowing inwards.

792
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:33,920
That's not possible.

793
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:35,040
Water should flow outwards.

794
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:36,000
Yes, I know.

795
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:37,120
Maybe you hooked it up wrong.

796
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:39,440
No, that's not possible.
I was extra careful.

797
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:42,280
I connected the drain pipe to the tap,
putting the other pipe in the toilet.

798
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:43,240
Seems right to me.

799
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:45,920
Anyway, something's wrong.

800
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:51,080
I'll go and check.

801
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:57,480
I messed up again.

802
00:36:58,160 --> 00:36:59,760
I'm such an idiot.

803
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:04,720
I turned off the water
so it should drop.

804
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:05,480
It's dropping.
Look.

805
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:07,280
Before he had two geysers
shooting from his eyes,

806
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:08,720
and now he has
two little disks.

807
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:10,760
Damn, we need to get him out of there.
He'll drown.

808
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:11,680
Are you sure about this?

809
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:13,760
He's extremely dangerous.
We can't toy with him.

810
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:16,760
Do you think the death of a Belgian
at a French station is something funny?

811
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:18,080
You're right.
That isn't funny.

812
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:21,960
There must be a way to
quickly open this.

813
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:23,160
See anything?

814
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:24,680
A button, a lever.

815
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:26,480
A chain?

816
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:28,800
No, a handle.

817
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:30,440
Hurry up.
Grab it on your side.

818
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:31,680
- Ready?
- Yeah.

819
00:37:31,715 --> 00:37:32,120
One.

820
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:32,920
Two.

821
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:41,160
He doesn't look good.

822
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:43,160
Let's take off the mask.

823
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:44,680
You do it.

824
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:46,560
- Why me?
- Go ahead, do it.

825
00:37:57,240 --> 00:37:58,400
This thing is hard
to take off.

826
00:37:58,520 --> 00:37:59,320
Do it slowly.

827
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:05,960
This is funny.

828
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:07,560
This isn't how
I imagined him.

829
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:08,320
Then how?

830
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:09,040
I don't know...

831
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:11,800
With a face like...
And teeth like...

832
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:12,960
And a jaw like...

833
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,240
- Like a monster.
- Yeah. Worse.

834
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:16,000
The biggest killers
are the most anonymous.

835
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:17,680
The better they look,
the more careful we are.

836
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:18,400
Go ahead, wake him.

837
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:22,280
What are you doing?

838
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:23,120
I'm being careful.

839
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:31,160
Sir?

840
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:33,160
Sir?

841
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:35,520
Sir?

842
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:37,320
Sir?

843
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:42,440
He feels better now.

844
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:45,120
That's good.
I'm glad.

845
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:50,000
Where am I?

846
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:51,920
You're at Marseille's main
police station.

847
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:57,040
And you're police officers?

848
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:00,120
Yes.

849
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:01,600
We're soon to be
chief inspectors.

850
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:03,640
Soon to be chief inspectors.

851
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:08,760
- The book?
- No, first the flyswatter.

852
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:12,040
Stop it!

853
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:13,280
Stop it.

854
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:13,920
/Listen.

855
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:15,360
This is a regrettable mistake.

856
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:19,200
And it's not the fault of the
French police, but the Belgian one.

857
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:22,920
It's true.

858
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:30,600
Mr. Albert Vandenbosh.

859
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:33,440
Wanted by Interpol for
criminal cases in 17 countries.

860
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:34,280
Memory coming back?

861
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:35,800
My memory is good
and that's the problem.

862
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:39,080
My name isn't Albert Vandenbosh
but Fénimore Eugene Triboulet

863
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:41,200
and I'm an attaché
at the Belgian Embassy.

864
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:45,200
He thinks we're morons.

865
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:47,920
1987. Armed robbery on
the Paris-Bouche train.

866
00:39:47,955 --> 00:39:49,160
I did not commit any crime.

867
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:50,320
I'm an attaché.

868
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:51,360
You're rather attached.

869
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:53,720
If you think we'll believe your story,
then you're very mistaken.

870
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:55,800
Alan, prepare a report
for the boss.

871
00:39:56,680 --> 00:39:57,880
It'll make him happy.

872
00:39:58,200 --> 00:39:59,080
I'll go over to the file.

873
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:00,520
/Write.

874
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:02,960
Albert Vandenbosh.

875
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,200
/Eugene Triboulet, I tell you.

876
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:05,760
I know that Vandenbosh.

877
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:08,280
Look at his picture.
He has a different face.

878
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:09,160
/He has a moron's face.

879
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:10,520
Yeah, sure.

880
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:11,240
Emilien?

881
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:13,160
Come and see this.

882
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:18,600
Who is this?

883
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:21,120
Albert Vandenbosh.

884
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:22,200
See?
I told you.

885
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:24,040
/I won't blame you,
/it wasn't your fault.

886
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:24,800
/Untie me.

887
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:26,800
I won't file a complaint
and we can forget about this.

888
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:29,680
Where did you meet Vandenbosh?

889
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:31,440
I wouldn't say that
I met him.

890
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:33,560
I saw him at the
police station in Bruges.

891
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:35,280
What were you doing
at the station in Bruges?

892
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:36,480
/I came to report a robbery.

893
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:38,120
I was the victim
of a carjacking.

894
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:38,600
A car what?

895
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:40,160
A carjacking.
My Toyota was stolen.

896
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:43,200
Two guys threw me out of my car
and drove off with it.

897
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:45,960
In Marseille we call
that a "Parisian".

898
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:47,440
In Belgium we say "carjacking".

899
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:48,840
- Carjacking.
- Carjacking.

900
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:49,920
And then?

901
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:53,400
I was in the Commissionaire's office,
a kind and hospitable man,

902
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:55,720
when I felt the need
to go to the bathroom.

903
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:57,960
You always feel the
need to go pee?

904
00:40:58,840 --> 00:41:00,680
I had some prostate
surgery last year.

905
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:01,680
I'm sorry.

906
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:02,520
And then?

907
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:06,280
I was in the bathroom cabin,
when I stumbled upon Vandenbosh,

908
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:07,840
who was taking off
this horrible suit.

909
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:10,280
/And then his accomplices
/jumped on top of me

910
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:12,520
and forced me to put on
this horrible attire.

911
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:14,040
/Of course I tried
/to defend myself.

912
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:16,280
But they quickly put
the ball in my mouth

913
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:18,720
and since then
I couldn't defend myself.

914
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:19,520
Do you understand?

915
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:20,840
You're really good.

916
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:24,480
But unluckily for you,
you've met your match today.

917
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:25,200
Emilien?

918
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:26,200
What now?

919
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:27,440
Can you come and see this?

920
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:32,400
BELGIAN EMBASSY

921
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:34,320
FENIMORE EUGENE TRIBOULET
CULTURAL ATTACHE

922
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:36,040
Fénimore Eugene Triboulet.

923
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:39,240
Cultural attaché at the Belgian
embassy since 1996.

924
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:41,440
/Since the 17th of May 1996
/to be exact.

925
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:45,120
My nomination was also shown
in the evening TV news.

926
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:46,360
Is there a number to call?

927
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:47,360
Yeah, there's the number.

928
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:48,120
Go ahead, call.

929
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:49,720
Call them.

930
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:57,840
Belgian Embassy, hello.
How may I help you?

931
00:41:57,880 --> 00:42:00,000
Hello.
I'd like to talk to Mr. Triboulet.

932
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:02,440
Unfortunately Mr. Triboulet
has been absent for 3 days.

933
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:05,640
Do you know where I can find him?
It's an important matter.

934
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:06,960
To be honest,

935
00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:09,160
/we haven't heard from
/Mr. Triboulet in 3 days.

936
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:11,600
and the embassy is
starting to worry.

937
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:12,800
Are you saying he's disappeared?

938
00:42:12,840 --> 00:42:13,800
Something like that.

939
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:16,080
We know he went to the station
in Bruges Tuesday morning,

940
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:18,040
/to report the carjacking
/of his Toyota.

941
00:42:18,360 --> 00:42:20,800
And since then we
have no news of him.

942
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:22,120
/Are you his father?

943
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:23,440
No.

944
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:26,160
That's terrible.

945
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:28,200
I'll call again later.

946
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:33,000
Holy cow...

947
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:36,320
Will you talk?

948
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:38,840
Go easy on him.

949
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:41,080
Don't worry.
I have an eye on them.

950
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:43,600
And you try not to
burn down the station.

951
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:47,200
Can you borrow me some clothes?
We have a problem with the prisoner.

952
00:42:47,240 --> 00:42:48,200
Yeah, look in the closet.

953
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:50,120
/The boss has a few
/shirts to change clothes.

954
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:52,800
You're right.

955
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:54,560
He can change clothes
every 10 minutes.

956
00:42:56,120 --> 00:42:57,080
My little Daniel.

957
00:42:57,120 --> 00:42:58,200
You've come at the right time.

958
00:42:58,400 --> 00:42:59,120
Is there a problem?

959
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:01,920
No, but it would be nice if
you could sign an armistice.

960
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:15,920
Leo, look over here.

961
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:20,280
Awesome.

962
00:43:20,320 --> 00:43:22,840
I prefer to die in glory
than to surrender in infamy.

963
00:43:25,360 --> 00:43:26,120
What is that?

964
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:31,720
Peace.
The war's over.

965
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:38,640
Are you OK, Mr. General?

966
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:39,800
I'm fine.

967
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:41,240
I'm fine.

968
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:46,080
I lost the battle
but not the war.

969
00:43:46,120 --> 00:43:48,200
If you don't mind the next
battle will be some other time.

970
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:49,920
I'd like the kids
to do their homework.

971
00:43:50,080 --> 00:43:51,600
Yes.
Of course.

972
00:43:52,120 --> 00:43:53,000
Let's do it this Sunday.

973
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:54,200
This Sunday.
That's right.

974
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:55,320
The day of Our Father.

975
00:43:55,880 --> 00:43:56,800
It'll make Him happy.

976
00:43:57,160 --> 00:43:57,920
Yes.

977
00:43:58,440 --> 00:43:59,960
And we'll eat an apple pie.

978
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,520
Very good.
I'll take care of that.

979
00:44:01,560 --> 00:44:03,080
Go to the car.

980
00:44:05,560 --> 00:44:08,600
You were supposed to be good for 2 hours,
and not destroy his living room.

981
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:11,000
He started it.
We wanted to play checkers.

982
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:13,120
But he said that checkers
are a game for faggots.

983
00:44:13,160 --> 00:44:15,120
Checkers are a game for faggots?
He said that?

984
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:17,320
And do you know what
a "faggot" is?

985
00:44:17,360 --> 00:44:19,280
A "faggot" is a flyswatter.

986
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:22,360
My dad says there are plenty
of faggots at the office.

987
00:44:26,760 --> 00:44:29,920
I don't know what these flies
ate this summer but they're huge.

988
00:44:32,520 --> 00:44:34,600
Your boss must be
really well-built.

989
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,560
These clothes are a little too big
but you look good in them.

990
00:44:37,600 --> 00:44:40,000
This isn't exactly my style
but I won't be picky.

991
00:44:40,040 --> 00:44:41,920
Better this than
that diving suit.

992
00:44:41,960 --> 00:44:42,840
That's for sure.

993
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:50,680
This one is huge.

994
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:55,280
Are you nuts?

995
00:44:55,320 --> 00:44:56,280
/Sorry, man.

996
00:44:56,320 --> 00:44:58,400
But there was a giant
fly right here.

997
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:02,640
Giant flies and worms.
I know what you're saying.

998
00:45:02,680 --> 00:45:03,960
I have something
to make it go away.

999
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,280
I assure you...
Where did it go?

1000
00:45:06,320 --> 00:45:08,040
How many of these
flyswatters do you have?

1001
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:09,640
No, it's not at
all like that.

1002
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:10,440
/I'll explain.

1003
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:12,640
Our boss loves fly fishing.

1004
00:45:13,480 --> 00:45:14,600
And his birthday is coming up,

1005
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:16,960
so we're collecting
some flies for him.

1006
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:18,600
It'll be a surprise.

1007
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:22,000
Excuse me.

1008
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:23,360
OK...

1009
00:45:24,040 --> 00:45:25,000
/Give you a ride?

1010
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:27,280
No, thank you.
I'll take a cab.

1011
00:45:28,360 --> 00:45:29,200
Bye.

1012
00:45:30,600 --> 00:45:31,720
And once again I'm sorry.

1013
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:37,720
Daniel.

1014
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:38,760
Is Emilien off duty?

1015
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:40,080
He has an hour left.

1016
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:43,640
Tell him I'm with the kids.
I'll get the pizzas and we'll meet at my place.

1017
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:44,840
Alright.
I'll tell him.

1018
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:45,920
/- Bye.
- Thanks.

1019
00:45:54,920 --> 00:45:57,560
You've arrived at the right time.
I was looking for a means of transport.

1020
00:45:57,600 --> 00:45:59,280
Where should I drive you, sir?

1021
00:45:59,320 --> 00:46:00,840
Number 4, Mediterranean Square.

1022
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:01,680
/Nice address.

1023
00:46:01,720 --> 00:46:02,960
And may I ask for a favor?

1024
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:03,760
Which is?

1025
00:46:03,800 --> 00:46:06,120
I know that French Riviera inhabitants
live at their own pace,

1026
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:08,400
because of the sun, which induces
them to take siestas.

1027
00:46:08,440 --> 00:46:12,080
But the sun has set and the heat
has subsided so I won't play the tourist.

1028
00:46:12,120 --> 00:46:13,800
So could you step on it,

1029
00:46:13,840 --> 00:46:16,280
so that I may arrive at my
destination as soon as possible?

1030
00:46:16,320 --> 00:46:17,560
The port of Marseille,

1031
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:18,640
for Marseille.

1032
00:46:18,680 --> 00:46:19,520
Right?

1033
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:22,400
You better buckle up
instead of being a wise guy.

1034
00:46:22,440 --> 00:46:23,080
What?

1035
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:28,280
/- Disgusting.
/- What a stench.

1036
00:46:29,840 --> 00:46:30,680
I deserved it.

1037
00:46:35,840 --> 00:46:36,960
Have a nice stay in Marseille.

1038
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:38,160
Bye.

1039
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:48,720
Delta 1, the sardine has arrived.

1040
00:46:48,760 --> 00:46:49,960
Your turn,
Delta 3.

1041
00:46:50,120 --> 00:46:51,720
/Roger that.
/We're on our way.

1042
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:52,520
We're starting.

1043
00:46:57,080 --> 00:46:59,800
This is better than those clothes
that smelled like sardines.

1044
00:47:00,200 --> 00:47:01,680
Did you get all the
things I asked for?

1045
00:47:01,720 --> 00:47:02,440
Everything's ready.

1046
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:03,440
What about the specialist?

1047
00:47:03,480 --> 00:47:06,080
It's not easy to find
someone competent in this town.

1048
00:47:06,120 --> 00:47:07,120
So I had to...

1049
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:10,120
Serge, I'm not asking
how brilliant you were,

1050
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:11,840
but whether you
found a specialist.

1051
00:47:11,880 --> 00:47:12,800
The best of the best.

1052
00:47:12,840 --> 00:47:14,960
Then get me a meeting with him,
if you don't mind.

1053
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:15,600
Of course.

1054
00:47:15,880 --> 00:47:17,560
I asked him to
pay you a visit.

1055
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:19,680
That must be him.

1056
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:34,600
Do we kiss or shake hands?

1057
00:47:34,640 --> 00:47:36,040
Given the choice,
I'll pick the kiss.

1058
00:47:38,320 --> 00:47:39,800
In Belgium it's 3.

1059
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:44,280
It's an honor to
work for you.

1060
00:47:44,320 --> 00:47:46,640
- What do you know about my work?
- Work. What a vulgar word.

1061
00:47:46,680 --> 00:47:48,640
I prefer to speak
of your masterpiece.

1062
00:47:49,320 --> 00:47:50,080
She's good.

1063
00:47:50,280 --> 00:47:51,000
OK.

1064
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:51,800
When do we start?

1065
00:47:52,280 --> 00:47:52,920
Not so fast.

1066
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:54,280
I'm a softy for compliments,

1067
00:47:54,440 --> 00:47:56,320
but before we begin,
I have to test you.

1068
00:47:56,360 --> 00:47:57,280
A sort of ritual.

1069
00:47:59,240 --> 00:48:00,000
I'll close my eyes.

1070
00:48:00,040 --> 00:48:01,280
I'll hold you close.

1071
00:48:01,320 --> 00:48:04,360
And you'll try, I repeat,
you'll try to steal something

1072
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:05,520
without me noticing.

1073
00:48:05,560 --> 00:48:07,120
You have 1 minute.
Starting now.

1074
00:48:08,760 --> 00:48:10,440
I set it to the
right time.

1075
00:48:10,680 --> 00:48:11,880
It was running a minute late.

1076
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:14,320
She's really very good.

1077
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:15,760
Where did you recruit her?

1078
00:48:18,880 --> 00:48:19,680
It's no use.

1079
00:48:19,720 --> 00:48:22,720
We've tried the books but he's not
interested in any of them.

1080
00:48:22,760 --> 00:48:23,240
OK...

1081
00:48:23,320 --> 00:48:24,480
I see only one solution.

1082
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:27,000
- He's here.
- Where's the bear?

1083
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:31,760
His nose is warm.

1084
00:48:32,040 --> 00:48:33,480
He's not a bear,
he's a commissionaire.

1085
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:35,840
He shot himself with a sleeping dart.
We need to wake him.

1086
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,480
That's what I thought because
I've never seen such a species.

1087
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:41,200
I'll apply the antidote.

1088
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:43,080
This dose is
for an elephant,

1089
00:48:43,120 --> 00:48:44,920
but it works the same way
in case of a bear.

1090
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:46,480
Do you know what
you're doing?

1091
00:48:46,520 --> 00:48:47,040
Yes.

1092
00:48:47,080 --> 00:48:48,840
The most important is
to aim properly,

1093
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:51,880
above the trunk
and between the eyes.

1094
00:48:54,040 --> 00:48:55,680
- Emilien!
- I'm here, boss.

1095
00:48:56,480 --> 00:48:57,560
Are you OK?
What's wrong?

1096
00:48:57,600 --> 00:48:59,240
That's a normal reaction.

1097
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:01,160
He should lie some
time in his basket.

1098
00:49:03,800 --> 00:49:05,280
I dozed off for 5 minutes.

1099
00:49:05,560 --> 00:49:06,520
What time is it?

1100
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:07,920
12:05?

1101
00:49:07,960 --> 00:49:09,120
That's why I'm so hungry.

1102
00:49:09,160 --> 00:49:09,960
I'd eat an ox.

1103
00:49:10,640 --> 00:49:11,680
Shall I order a pizza, boss?

1104
00:49:11,720 --> 00:49:12,920
I won't refuse, my little Alan.

1105
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:13,400
I'm on it.

1106
00:49:13,720 --> 00:49:16,760
Emilien, I had an absurd dream
and you were in it.

1107
00:49:16,840 --> 00:49:17,320
Really?

1108
00:49:17,360 --> 00:49:19,720
Yes, that Belgian had tricked you

1109
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:21,040
and you let him get away.

1110
00:49:22,440 --> 00:49:24,160
It was one of those dreams.

1111
00:49:28,680 --> 00:49:29,440
Emilien?

1112
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:50,000
Daniel...

1113
00:49:50,920 --> 00:49:52,600
You'll never believe
what happened.

1114
00:49:52,840 --> 00:49:53,760
You got fired?

1115
00:49:54,120 --> 00:49:54,760
How'd you know?

1116
00:49:54,840 --> 00:49:56,760
You get fired once a month.
It's easy to remember.

1117
00:49:56,800 --> 00:49:58,320
But this time it's
for real, Daniel.

1118
00:49:58,360 --> 00:49:59,800
Do you remember that
public enemy no. 1?

1119
00:49:59,840 --> 00:50:01,840
We were supposed to keep
an eye on him during his stay.

1120
00:50:02,160 --> 00:50:03,320
- I let him get away.
- No?

1121
00:50:03,360 --> 00:50:04,000
I did.

1122
00:50:04,040 --> 00:50:05,680
He got away
and I didn't stop him.

1123
00:50:05,720 --> 00:50:06,560
I'm such an idiot.

1124
00:50:06,600 --> 00:50:07,880
That was quite a stupidity.

1125
00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:10,360
It's not just one stupidity,
it's a whole bunch.

1126
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:12,240
I keep stacking them one
on top of the other.

1127
00:50:12,520 --> 00:50:15,200
I've made so many of them,
I can write the dictionary of stupidity.

1128
00:50:15,240 --> 00:50:16,160
Don't rub it in.

1129
00:50:16,200 --> 00:50:17,280
/You had your successes.

1130
00:50:17,320 --> 00:50:18,440
/The Santa Clause gang?

1131
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:19,240
That Chinese woman?

1132
00:50:19,640 --> 00:50:20,600
Those were lucky shots.

1133
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:23,320
I'm a good-for-nothing, Daniel.

1134
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:26,400
Gibert did the right thing by
taking away my badge. I don't deserve it.

1135
00:50:26,440 --> 00:50:28,000
Don't worry.
You're not the only one.

1136
00:50:28,200 --> 00:50:30,480
Besides, I picked this profession
to make my dad happy.

1137
00:50:30,640 --> 00:50:32,640
He asked me on his death bed.
How could I refuse?

1138
00:50:32,680 --> 00:50:33,400
That's not easy.

1139
00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:35,480
But you tried your best
and that's what counts.

1140
00:50:36,680 --> 00:50:37,720
Yeah, you're right.

1141
00:50:39,240 --> 00:50:41,320
Time to start a new chapter
and do something else.

1142
00:50:41,560 --> 00:50:42,720
Something that I care about.

1143
00:50:42,760 --> 00:50:44,680
Now that's positive attitude.

1144
00:50:45,240 --> 00:50:47,440
Apart from stupidities,
what would you like to do?

1145
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:50,600
That's problem.
I've become attached to this profession.

1146
00:50:50,840 --> 00:50:52,760
It's one of the most
beautiful professions.

1147
00:50:52,920 --> 00:50:55,560
In that case, you're really
in a dead end.

1148
00:50:56,240 --> 00:51:00,000
If only I could find the Belgian,
Gibert would give me back my badge.

1149
00:51:00,040 --> 00:51:00,720
What Belgian?

1150
00:51:00,760 --> 00:51:01,920
The prisoner was a Belgian.

1151
00:51:01,960 --> 00:51:03,560
With a big face,
dressed as a fisherman?

1152
00:51:03,600 --> 00:51:04,120
Yeah.

1153
00:51:06,240 --> 00:51:07,320
That's exactly him.

1154
00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:08,760
Did you see him?

1155
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:10,600
He got in my cab
in front of the station.

1156
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:11,720
That was him.

1157
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:13,445
He didn't want a lift,
preferring a cab.

1158
00:51:13,480 --> 00:51:16,840
That was a truly spectacular escape.
Was there also a goodbye fanfare?

1159
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:18,880
Stop it, Daniel.
Do you remember where you drove him?

1160
00:51:18,920 --> 00:51:19,800
Of course I remember.

1161
00:51:20,320 --> 00:51:21,560
You're a genius, Daniel.

1162
00:51:23,720 --> 00:51:24,240
Emilien?

1163
00:51:24,280 --> 00:51:24,920
What?

1164
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:26,240
And what about the kids?

1165
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:29,160
/Crap.
/The kids.

1166
00:51:29,600 --> 00:51:30,680
Do you have an idea?

1167
00:51:33,680 --> 00:51:34,600
My little Daniel.

1168
00:51:35,160 --> 00:51:36,120
Is it already Sunday?

1169
00:51:36,160 --> 00:51:37,120
Yes, it's Sunday.

1170
00:51:37,160 --> 00:51:39,080
I'll leave the kids
and go get the apple pie.

1171
00:51:39,920 --> 00:51:40,720
Very good.

1172
00:51:40,760 --> 00:51:41,960
I'll fire up the oven.

1173
00:51:50,360 --> 00:51:51,320
Are you sure this is it?

1174
00:51:51,360 --> 00:51:52,520
Yes, no. 4.

1175
00:51:53,520 --> 00:51:55,200
We have to make sure
they're still here.

1176
00:51:55,640 --> 00:51:56,440
They're still here.

1177
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:58,400
How do you know?
The lights are out.

1178
00:51:58,440 --> 00:52:00,760
The lights are out because they're
sleeping like everyone else,

1179
00:52:00,840 --> 00:52:01,760
except morons.

1180
00:52:01,840 --> 00:52:03,000
And the car is
parked up front.

1181
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:06,200
You'd make a good cop,
you know?

1182
00:52:07,520 --> 00:52:08,640
Was that a compliment?

1183
00:52:09,280 --> 00:52:09,845
Yes.

1184
00:52:09,880 --> 00:52:11,280
Don't tell me it
never attracted you.

1185
00:52:11,320 --> 00:52:13,240
As a kid, you never played
cops and robbers?

1186
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:15,440
I did. But I was always
part of the other team.

1187
00:52:15,480 --> 00:52:16,000
Always.

1188
00:52:16,040 --> 00:52:18,960
So if you want my help tomorrow,
I need to get some sleep.

1189
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:20,840
- Is that possible?
- Go ahead. Sleep.

1190
00:52:20,920 --> 00:52:22,080
I'll keep an eye on them.

1191
00:52:34,440 --> 00:52:35,240
Emilien!

1192
00:52:38,800 --> 00:52:40,400
I'm sorry.
I dozed off.

1193
00:52:40,520 --> 00:52:43,560
We have coffee, hamburgers,
cheeseburgers, cake.

1194
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:45,040
And yogurt.

1195
00:52:45,080 --> 00:52:46,280
You had all
this in the car?

1196
00:52:46,320 --> 00:52:47,520
I went out to buy it.

1197
00:52:47,840 --> 00:52:48,560
What?

1198
00:52:49,120 --> 00:52:50,560
So the house wasn't
being watched?

1199
00:52:50,600 --> 00:52:54,000
I was supposed to sleep, and you were
supposed to watch the house.

1200
00:52:54,040 --> 00:52:55,880
But you snore so loud
that I can't sleep.

1201
00:52:55,920 --> 00:52:56,960
So maybe they ran off.

1202
00:52:57,080 --> 00:52:58,520
They didn't run off.
Look.

1203
00:52:58,680 --> 00:53:00,160
The car is parked
in the same spot.

1204
00:53:00,200 --> 00:53:02,800
Two guys drove up in
a second car an hour ago.

1205
00:53:02,840 --> 00:53:04,200
Yeah? Why didn't
you wake me up?

1206
00:53:04,240 --> 00:53:06,120
When you're asleep that's
when I get some rest.

1207
00:53:06,160 --> 00:53:07,040
In spite of the snoring.

1208
00:53:07,080 --> 00:53:07,600
Daniel...

1209
00:53:08,360 --> 00:53:09,080
They're leaving.

1210
00:53:11,480 --> 00:53:12,440
/There's your Belgian.

1211
00:53:12,560 --> 00:53:13,320
It's not him.

1212
00:53:13,360 --> 00:53:15,040
He didn't have a mustache
and he was younger.

1213
00:53:15,080 --> 00:53:16,680
Emilien, he disguised himself.

1214
00:53:17,440 --> 00:53:19,000
Look.
That mustache is falling off.

1215
00:53:19,760 --> 00:53:20,520
/Yes...

1216
00:53:20,600 --> 00:53:22,640
/Why would he dress up
/as an old man when going out?

1217
00:53:22,720 --> 00:53:24,800
Maybe because the police
is looking for him.

1218
00:53:24,840 --> 00:53:25,840
Oh yeah, of course.

1219
00:53:26,960 --> 00:53:28,960
But I've seen that girl
somewhere before.

1220
00:53:36,240 --> 00:53:37,200
I've never seen her.

1221
00:53:59,680 --> 00:54:00,800
Where are they going?

1222
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:01,680
Guess.

1223
00:54:06,280 --> 00:54:07,720
MONACO

1224
00:54:12,040 --> 00:54:12,960
/Monaco, of course.

1225
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,280
One bank per square inch.
This is paradise for him.

1226
00:54:15,400 --> 00:54:16,880
It's called a fiscal paradise.

1227
00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:17,920
Yeah, tell me about it.

1228
00:54:17,960 --> 00:54:19,880
There are plenty of boxes
here we'd like to open.

1229
00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:21,325
It would help us in many cases.

1230
00:54:21,360 --> 00:54:25,360
Should I ask the Belgian to open a few?
He owes you that for your help.

1231
00:54:25,520 --> 00:54:26,480
Stop your nonsense.

1232
00:54:35,080 --> 00:54:35,760
There we go.

1233
00:54:37,520 --> 00:54:38,480
He's chosen a bank.

1234
00:54:40,960 --> 00:54:42,120
BELGIAN ROYAL BANK

1235
00:54:47,400 --> 00:54:48,840
Belgian Royal Bank.

1236
00:54:49,560 --> 00:54:51,200
Most likely he's homesick.

1237
00:54:51,320 --> 00:54:52,400
/Will they rob the bank?

1238
00:54:52,560 --> 00:54:53,920
They didn't go
to play boules.

1239
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:54,840
I'm calling Gibert.

1240
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,320
Don't you want to wait
until you have some proof?

1241
00:54:57,520 --> 00:54:59,520
Don't worry.
We'll find the proof later.

1242
00:54:59,560 --> 00:55:00,720
/Hello, sir?
/Emilien speaking.

1243
00:55:00,760 --> 00:55:03,240
I have the Belgian.
I mean I've located him.

1244
00:55:03,400 --> 00:55:04,720
I know I'm not a cop anymore.

1245
00:55:04,760 --> 00:55:08,480
I was taking a walk and I saw him
walk into a bank with his gang.

1246
00:55:09,120 --> 00:55:10,480
They didn't go
there to play boules.

1247
00:55:11,840 --> 00:55:13,640
It's the Belgian Royal Bank
in Monaco.

1248
00:55:13,680 --> 00:55:14,760
Yeah, it's far.

1249
00:55:15,600 --> 00:55:17,640
OK, I'll try to
slow them down.

1250
00:55:18,800 --> 00:55:19,560
They're coming.

1251
00:55:19,720 --> 00:55:20,520
Great.

1252
00:55:20,640 --> 00:55:22,800
We've located the Daltons,
and they're sending Rantanplan.

1253
00:55:23,280 --> 00:55:25,240
Hello.
How may I help you?

1254
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:27,520
Yes, I've come to
see my son, Edward.

1255
00:55:27,560 --> 00:55:29,040
Edward Triboulet?
You're his father?

1256
00:55:29,080 --> 00:55:29,600
Yes.

1257
00:55:29,640 --> 00:55:31,080
My pleasure.
He'll be happy to see you.

1258
00:55:31,120 --> 00:55:32,920
This way please.
Second floor, room 115.

1259
00:55:32,960 --> 00:55:34,160
Thank you, young man.

1260
00:55:34,960 --> 00:55:35,760
This way.

1261
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:37,160
You're kind, Etienne.

1262
00:55:39,040 --> 00:55:39,720
Come in.

1263
00:55:42,760 --> 00:55:43,440
Dad?

1264
00:55:44,040 --> 00:55:46,200
- Dad has been dead for 4 years, moron.
- Oh, right.

1265
00:55:46,240 --> 00:55:47,960
He wouldn't be proud
you changed your name.

1266
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:49,720
You didn't like it, did you?

1267
00:55:49,960 --> 00:55:50,880
Fénimore...

1268
00:55:51,800 --> 00:55:52,640
You're not in prison?

1269
00:55:53,120 --> 00:55:53,960
Not this week.

1270
00:55:54,120 --> 00:55:56,280
I treat prison like
a country house.

1271
00:55:56,320 --> 00:55:57,560
I go there to relax.

1272
00:56:04,040 --> 00:56:04,960
Bring your head closer.

1273
00:56:06,280 --> 00:56:07,680
What a stupid hairstyle.

1274
00:56:07,720 --> 00:56:08,880
Can't you get
another hairstyle?

1275
00:56:08,920 --> 00:56:10,400
Girls don't like hair
combed like that.

1276
00:56:10,440 --> 00:56:12,520
They like hair combed
like mine.

1277
00:56:13,960 --> 00:56:15,440
I assume you're still single.

1278
00:56:15,800 --> 00:56:16,600
Yes.

1279
00:56:38,640 --> 00:56:39,920
Delta 1, we're in position.

1280
00:56:40,680 --> 00:56:41,840
/Roger that, Delta 2.

1281
00:56:44,960 --> 00:56:46,320
That girl is going
to join them.

1282
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:48,000
/I've seen her before.

1283
00:56:48,080 --> 00:56:49,120
I'm sure of that.

1284
00:56:50,560 --> 00:56:51,520
I'm entering the bank.

1285
00:56:51,600 --> 00:56:52,640
/Roger that, Delta 2.

1286
00:56:52,880 --> 00:56:53,920
We have you on visual.

1287
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:55,000
Things are heating up.

1288
00:56:55,560 --> 00:56:57,720
Maybe I'll go there
and have a discreet look.

1289
00:56:57,760 --> 00:56:58,440
No.

1290
00:56:58,480 --> 00:56:59,680
You don't know
what discreet is.

1291
00:56:59,720 --> 00:57:01,760
We stay in the car
and wait for Rantanplan.

1292
00:57:05,200 --> 00:57:05,960
Madame?

1293
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,520
I have an appointment with
Mr. Triboulet to open an account.

1294
00:57:10,200 --> 00:57:11,640
I'll call him, madam.

1295
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:19,720
Go ahead.
What are you waiting for?

1296
00:57:21,280 --> 00:57:22,040
Hello?

1297
00:57:22,960 --> 00:57:24,000
A client.

1298
00:57:24,040 --> 00:57:24,800
/Take care of her.

1299
00:57:24,840 --> 00:57:26,560
Don't let my presence
inconvenience you.

1300
00:57:26,600 --> 00:57:28,000
Yes, I'm coming.

1301
00:57:28,240 --> 00:57:29,000
/Right away.

1302
00:57:30,760 --> 00:57:32,280
Go and give me
the keys to the safe.

1303
00:57:32,320 --> 00:57:33,200
/I'll take your place.

1304
00:57:33,920 --> 00:57:36,360
I only have the keys
to the empty boxes.

1305
00:57:38,720 --> 00:57:40,000
I only open accounts.

1306
00:57:40,560 --> 00:57:42,040
Good, because so do I.

1307
00:57:47,120 --> 00:57:48,920
I'm sorry for the delay, countess.

1308
00:57:49,080 --> 00:57:50,120
Please, this way.

1309
00:57:54,560 --> 00:57:56,360
- Open it.
- Yes sir, Mr. Triboulet.

1310
00:58:03,680 --> 00:58:05,200
If you don't mind
the step, countess.

1311
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:21,000
And we're done.

1312
00:58:22,600 --> 00:58:23,680
Your turn, countess.

1313
00:58:28,520 --> 00:58:30,480
Do you have a favorite place
when opening an account?

1314
00:58:32,040 --> 00:58:32,920
That wall there.

1315
00:58:32,960 --> 00:58:35,360
On that wall we have number 82.
Alright?

1316
00:58:36,440 --> 00:58:37,120
Perfect.

1317
00:58:50,800 --> 00:58:52,400
And?
Catch anything?

1318
00:58:52,440 --> 00:58:54,560
I'm looking for the
alarm system cables.

1319
00:58:54,600 --> 00:58:55,840
/If I don't turn it off,

1320
00:58:55,880 --> 00:58:58,600
the alarm will go off when
we open a safety box.

1321
00:58:59,040 --> 00:59:00,320
She's really very good.

1322
00:59:01,160 --> 00:59:01,960
That's for sure.

1323
00:59:02,320 --> 00:59:04,800
Bring us something to eat.
I haven't eaten since last night.

1324
00:59:04,840 --> 00:59:06,000
I'll bring us something, boss.

1325
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:12,080
FRIES

1326
00:59:14,520 --> 00:59:15,600
What's Gibert doing?

1327
00:59:15,640 --> 00:59:17,280
It doesn't take an hour
to get to Monaco.

1328
00:59:17,320 --> 00:59:19,200
- I've taught you some bad habits.
- That's true.

1329
00:59:19,520 --> 00:59:20,600
And what are they doing?

1330
00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:22,200
It doesn't take an hour
to open a box.

1331
00:59:22,240 --> 00:59:23,600
Maybe they're opening
more than one.

1332
00:59:25,720 --> 00:59:27,240
This is a list of
those we want to open.

1333
00:59:27,280 --> 00:59:29,440
This will take some time.
Have a coffee.

1334
00:59:29,920 --> 00:59:30,760
A coffee?

1335
00:59:47,520 --> 00:59:48,920
The "La Libre Belgique" newspaper.

1336
00:59:49,360 --> 00:59:50,560
Now this is class.

1337
00:59:50,880 --> 00:59:52,600
In Her Majesty's service.

1338
01:00:02,080 --> 01:00:03,560
I've opened the first box.

1339
01:00:03,595 --> 01:00:05,040
Roger, Delta 2.
Carry on.

1340
01:00:18,680 --> 01:00:19,360
What?

1341
01:00:19,600 --> 01:00:21,040
A guy in a suit
and dark glasses

1342
01:00:21,080 --> 01:00:22,360
gets in a van
at 9 in the morning.

1343
01:00:22,400 --> 01:00:23,520
Do you think that's normal?

1344
01:00:23,560 --> 01:00:26,040
Maybe he got back from work
and is changing clothes before going out.

1345
01:00:26,080 --> 01:00:29,000
And he bought fries,
even though he sells them.

1346
01:00:29,040 --> 01:00:30,880
Maybe those he bought
are better than his own.

1347
01:00:30,920 --> 01:00:32,680
You have an answer
for everything.

1348
01:00:32,720 --> 01:00:34,120
And that's why I'm a cop.

1349
01:00:41,320 --> 01:00:43,645
I have only 5 boxes left.

1350
01:00:43,680 --> 01:00:45,320
Alright Delta 2, wait a moment.

1351
01:00:50,800 --> 01:00:54,080
Number 107.
I repeat: number 107. 1-0-7.

1352
01:00:54,320 --> 01:00:55,240
Roger.

1353
01:01:03,080 --> 01:01:04,400
A black diary.
Is that it?

1354
01:01:04,520 --> 01:01:05,320
Confirmed.

1355
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:11,800
- You scared me.
- I'm sorry.

1356
01:01:11,835 --> 01:01:13,600
- How's it going?
- Only 5 left.

1357
01:01:13,640 --> 01:01:15,320
- Hurry up.
- Of course.

1358
01:01:19,200 --> 01:01:20,660
It's me.
How's it going?

1359
01:01:20,695 --> 01:01:22,120
I'm doing what I can, but...

1360
01:01:22,160 --> 01:01:27,280
He has a smaller head than yours,
so the wig keeps falling off.

1361
01:01:27,315 --> 01:01:27,520
Stop fooling around
and get out of there!

1362
01:01:28,040 --> 01:01:28,885
Moron.

1363
01:01:28,920 --> 01:01:31,920
Enough of this.
Put on the mustache and let's go.

1364
01:01:32,280 --> 01:01:33,600
Or else he'll yell
at me again.

1365
01:01:35,080 --> 01:01:37,680
What are they doing?
Have they stopped for breakfast?

1366
01:01:37,760 --> 01:01:38,760
That wouldn't surprise me.

1367
01:01:40,400 --> 01:01:41,840
Look.
There.

1368
01:01:43,320 --> 01:01:44,680
I told you, he'll get away.

1369
01:01:44,715 --> 01:01:46,040
- Yes, hello?
/- Gibert here.

1370
01:01:46,320 --> 01:01:48,440
Boss, he's leaving the bank
disguised as an old man.

1371
01:01:48,480 --> 01:01:49,240
/Where are you?

1372
01:01:49,280 --> 01:01:51,400
The driver left to
ask for directions,

1373
01:01:51,440 --> 01:01:53,240
but it's not easy,
because the inhabitants

1374
01:01:53,280 --> 01:01:54,880
/run away when they see
/a police officer.

1375
01:01:54,920 --> 01:01:56,760
And the GPS is broken again.

1376
01:01:57,240 --> 01:01:58,840
It's displaying the wrong town.

1377
01:02:00,280 --> 01:02:01,200
Where do I go now?

1378
01:02:01,240 --> 01:02:02,440
You go to the beach.

1379
01:02:02,480 --> 01:02:04,920
Once you get there, you walk
into the sea and swim ahead.

1380
01:02:04,960 --> 01:02:06,160
- Alright.
- Now get lost.

1381
01:02:06,320 --> 01:02:09,000
He left and is going to get away.
He's at the end of the street.

1382
01:02:09,320 --> 01:02:10,480
It's there around that corner.

1383
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:14,760
Emilien, how was that
old man dressed?

1384
01:02:23,960 --> 01:02:24,760
What do we do?

1385
01:02:24,800 --> 01:02:26,400
Nothing. We don't care.
It's not him.

1386
01:02:26,880 --> 01:02:28,160
I'm not myself!
I'm not myself!

1387
01:02:28,200 --> 01:02:29,600
Sure.
And I'm not myself either.

1388
01:02:29,640 --> 01:02:30,920
Load him up.

1389
01:02:30,960 --> 01:02:32,600
You're making a mistake.
I'm not myself.

1390
01:02:32,640 --> 01:02:33,600
Emilien?

1391
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:34,880
Yes, boss?

1392
01:02:34,920 --> 01:02:37,680
/We'll meet at the office.
/I have a police badge for you.

1393
01:02:37,720 --> 01:02:38,640
Thank you, boss.

1394
01:02:39,360 --> 01:02:40,200
Did you hear that?

1395
01:02:41,400 --> 01:02:42,960
Wonderful!
And thanks to you, Daniel.

1396
01:02:43,160 --> 01:02:44,400
How will I ever thank you?

1397
01:02:44,440 --> 01:02:45,440
Emilien, something's fishy.

1398
01:02:45,480 --> 01:02:46,680
He simply feels guilty.

1399
01:02:46,720 --> 01:02:48,640
He knows I'm a good cop
and doesn't want to lose me.

1400
01:02:48,680 --> 01:02:50,520
I'm not talking about that,
but about the Belgian.

1401
01:02:50,560 --> 01:02:52,920
They drove up in 2 cars
and 6 people went in with bags.

1402
01:02:52,960 --> 01:02:54,960
Now 2 of them came out with
no bags and left on foot.

1403
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:56,160
Can you explain that?

1404
01:02:57,080 --> 01:02:57,800
No.

1405
01:02:58,960 --> 01:03:00,040
That's not easy.

1406
01:03:00,080 --> 01:03:02,440
And did you notice the old man
wasn't limping the same way?

1407
01:03:02,480 --> 01:03:04,040
I did notice that.

1408
01:03:04,520 --> 01:03:06,200
I thought he must have
fallen down the stairs.

1409
01:03:06,240 --> 01:03:07,840
Old people often
fall down the stairs.

1410
01:03:07,880 --> 01:03:09,800
And I think it's not
the same person.

1411
01:03:10,520 --> 01:03:11,200
Really?

1412
01:03:12,760 --> 01:03:14,680
If that wasn't the Belgian
then where is he?

1413
01:03:15,720 --> 01:03:16,600
There.

1414
01:03:20,720 --> 01:03:21,800
Holy cow...

1415
01:03:22,040 --> 01:03:24,080
I'll take a different route.
That'll be more discreet.

1416
01:03:24,120 --> 01:03:25,040
We'll meet at the house.

1417
01:03:25,080 --> 01:03:25,680
No way.

1418
01:03:25,720 --> 01:03:27,800
We rob together
and get caught together.

1419
01:03:27,880 --> 01:03:30,200
Besides, you won't leave me.
I'm rich and single.

1420
01:03:31,040 --> 01:03:32,080
I'd regret it.

1421
01:03:33,560 --> 01:03:35,080
Dammit.
He didn't let her leave.

1422
01:03:35,120 --> 01:03:36,120
What now?
Do we follow them?

1423
01:03:36,160 --> 01:03:37,400
With this piece of junk?

1424
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:41,440
What are you waiting for?
Follow them.

1425
01:03:41,480 --> 01:03:43,240
I'll let them get away.
It's more fun this way.

1426
01:03:43,280 --> 01:03:45,280
This isn't the
time for games. Go.

1427
01:04:00,040 --> 01:04:01,440
Why are they going
so slowly?

1428
01:04:01,520 --> 01:04:04,520
It's nice to drive slowly for once.
We can enjoy the scenery.

1429
01:04:04,680 --> 01:04:06,320
Driving this slowly
they'll suspect us.

1430
01:04:06,360 --> 01:04:08,760
A taxi cab is less suspicious
than a piece of junk with fries.

1431
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:11,160
What are they up to?

1432
01:04:11,360 --> 01:04:13,680
In Monaco they prefer
caviar over fries.

1433
01:04:13,720 --> 01:04:17,240
When they saw a car with Belgian plates,
they followed their client.

1434
01:04:17,280 --> 01:04:18,920
I assure you, this isn't
the time for jokes.

1435
01:04:18,960 --> 01:04:20,680
I remind you that
I'm up to my neck in trouble.

1436
01:04:20,720 --> 01:04:22,800
You got your badge back.
That's what matters.

1437
01:04:22,840 --> 01:04:23,480
Really?

1438
01:04:23,640 --> 01:04:26,520
You think Gibert will give me my badge,
when he learns he has the wrong guy?

1439
01:04:27,480 --> 01:04:30,480
My name is Edward Triboulet
and I work for the Belgian Royal Bank.

1440
01:04:30,600 --> 01:04:32,000
And I'm Hercule Poirot.

1441
01:04:32,040 --> 01:04:33,400
Alan, which book is it now?

1442
01:04:34,680 --> 01:04:36,280
- Number 77, boss.
- 77...

1443
01:04:36,600 --> 01:04:37,800
The Seine-et-Marne department.

1444
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:39,160
/A very nice department.

1445
01:04:39,400 --> 01:04:40,280
You'll see.

1446
01:04:41,160 --> 01:04:42,400
It's worth a visit, isn't it?

1447
01:04:42,840 --> 01:04:43,960
Let's try this again.

1448
01:04:44,160 --> 01:04:45,045
First and last name!

1449
01:04:45,080 --> 01:04:47,960
My name is Edward.
Edward Triboulet.

1450
01:04:48,400 --> 01:04:51,240
This is leading nowhere, boss.
And we have few books left.

1451
01:04:51,280 --> 01:04:54,920
Don't worry about that.
We have the 22-part encyclopedia.

1452
01:04:55,920 --> 01:04:57,000
But...

1453
01:04:57,200 --> 01:04:59,480
Since he's Belgian I thought

1454
01:04:59,800 --> 01:05:02,880
we could use a different method.

1455
01:05:02,960 --> 01:05:04,240
Do you know what I mean?

1456
01:05:04,280 --> 01:05:05,760
Good thinking, my little Alan.

1457
01:05:05,800 --> 01:05:06,720
Everyone get out.

1458
01:05:07,200 --> 01:05:08,280
Please!

1459
01:05:08,600 --> 01:05:10,120
Don't leave me!

1460
01:05:10,160 --> 01:05:11,280
Please, don't leave me!

1461
01:05:11,320 --> 01:05:12,480
Stay!

1462
01:05:17,600 --> 01:05:20,960
- So you're Belgian?
- Yes, I'm from Brussels.

1463
01:05:26,840 --> 01:05:28,640
Jacques Brel was also Belgian?

1464
01:05:28,680 --> 01:05:31,040
Yes, he was a great man
and a hero.

1465
01:05:31,440 --> 01:05:32,960
Let's listen to the hero.

1466
01:05:49,240 --> 01:05:50,400
Beautiful, isn't it?

1467
01:05:51,560 --> 01:05:52,560
Wonderful.

1468
01:05:52,600 --> 01:05:53,960
Is this better?

1469
01:05:55,320 --> 01:05:56,120
Not that.

1470
01:05:56,160 --> 01:05:56,720
No.
Mercy.

1471
01:05:56,800 --> 01:05:59,960
No!
Stop it!

1472
01:06:04,560 --> 01:06:06,360
- Not that...
- First and last name!

1473
01:06:06,760 --> 01:06:08,440
Help!
Save me!

1474
01:06:08,760 --> 01:06:11,200
- Damn. He's giving it to him.
- The boss is good at that.

1475
01:06:15,080 --> 01:06:16,440
Crap.

1476
01:06:17,920 --> 01:06:19,400
We lost those guys
with the fries.

1477
01:06:23,120 --> 01:06:24,200
We're not going
to the house?

1478
01:06:24,240 --> 01:06:26,520
I have greater ambitions
than that pitiful house.

1479
01:06:26,560 --> 01:06:27,600
Call the Columbian.

1480
01:06:37,480 --> 01:06:38,400
Are you out of prison?

1481
01:06:38,440 --> 01:06:39,640
Yes, I'm calling
to tell you

1482
01:06:39,680 --> 01:06:41,640
that thanks to what I'm holding,
you'll take my place.

1483
01:06:42,600 --> 01:06:43,280
I'm listening.

1484
01:06:43,440 --> 01:06:45,520
BRB. Belgian Royal Bank.
Ring a bell?

1485
01:06:45,560 --> 01:06:46,040
Yes.

1486
01:06:46,080 --> 01:06:48,640
/The things that were in your box
/are not there anymore.

1487
01:06:50,520 --> 01:06:51,120
Hello?

1488
01:06:51,960 --> 01:06:53,440
Did you drown in
your pretty pool?

1489
01:06:53,480 --> 01:06:54,320
What do you want?

1490
01:06:54,640 --> 01:06:55,440
/Not much.

1491
01:06:55,480 --> 01:06:58,920
You have 10 minutes to get in your yacht
and sail to your shitty country.

1492
01:07:01,320 --> 01:07:02,320
And we're done.

1493
01:07:02,400 --> 01:07:04,760
I got us an estate, my dear.
Tell me what you think.

1494
01:07:29,400 --> 01:07:30,440
/This is what I love.

1495
01:07:30,480 --> 01:07:32,720
I came here a year ago,
for talks with the Columbian.

1496
01:07:32,760 --> 01:07:34,680
And I fell madly in
love with this place.

1497
01:07:38,280 --> 01:07:40,200
But that bastard
wouldn't sell it to me.

1498
01:07:42,240 --> 01:07:43,840
Come, my dear.
I'll take you to paradise.

1499
01:07:49,280 --> 01:07:51,320
Look at this.
Isn't this beautiful?

1500
01:07:51,360 --> 01:07:52,200
Follow me.

1501
01:08:02,360 --> 01:08:03,880
Isn't this paradise?

1502
01:08:16,440 --> 01:08:17,920
This stuff is first class.

1503
01:08:18,520 --> 01:08:21,120
It's not the flour they sell
on the streets of the capital.

1504
01:08:22,200 --> 01:08:24,160
You turned me on
in the bank,

1505
01:08:24,200 --> 01:08:25,600
while opening those boxes.

1506
01:08:25,760 --> 01:08:26,480
Eugene...

1507
01:08:26,520 --> 01:08:28,240
Don't you think
we should slow down?

1508
01:08:28,280 --> 01:08:29,920
We have no time to lose.

1509
01:08:29,960 --> 01:08:31,920
We have to hurry,
ever faster.

1510
01:08:32,200 --> 01:08:33,840
We might be dead in an hour.

1511
01:08:34,080 --> 01:08:35,440
We have to make use
of each moment.

1512
01:08:35,560 --> 01:08:38,000
- You're right, Eugene.
- Call me Fénimore.

1513
01:08:38,040 --> 01:08:41,400
Fénimore, allow me to change clothes,
to look more beautiful.

1514
01:08:42,200 --> 01:08:43,320
That's a good idea.

1515
01:08:43,480 --> 01:08:44,400
I'll change too.

1516
01:08:44,440 --> 01:08:46,960
And we'll eat a candlelight dinner
on the patio overlooking the sea.

1517
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:48,240
Excellent.

1518
01:08:50,400 --> 01:08:51,760
See you soon,

1519
01:08:52,200 --> 01:08:53,280
Fénimore.

1520
01:08:58,160 --> 01:09:01,160
Delta 1, you need to come get me,
things are heating up here.

1521
01:09:01,480 --> 01:09:03,040
When will you be here?

1522
01:09:03,080 --> 01:09:04,000
Hold on, Delta 2.

1523
01:09:04,080 --> 01:09:06,120
Excuse me, sir.
How long will the repair take?

1524
01:09:06,320 --> 01:09:08,520
Young man...
2 or 3 days.

1525
01:09:09,360 --> 01:09:10,480
Delta 2...

1526
01:09:10,880 --> 01:09:12,120
I'm sending reinforcements.

1527
01:09:15,960 --> 01:09:17,200
/Emilien, what are you doing?

1528
01:09:17,240 --> 01:09:18,240
I'm calling reinforcements.

1529
01:09:21,360 --> 01:09:24,000
My little Emilien.
The Belgian admitted everything.

1530
01:09:24,040 --> 01:09:24,800
Everything?

1531
01:09:24,920 --> 01:09:27,120
/Everything.
/We couldn't stop him.

1532
01:09:27,280 --> 01:09:28,800
/And since he
/became so willing,

1533
01:09:28,840 --> 01:09:30,880
we attributed him
a few other cases.

1534
01:09:30,920 --> 01:09:33,520
He'll get a 1000 years of prison
and won't notice the difference.

1535
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:35,360
Boss, that's not
the right Belgian.

1536
01:09:35,400 --> 01:09:36,440
What do you mean?

1537
01:09:36,480 --> 01:09:37,720
That's his double,
a look-alike.

1538
01:09:37,760 --> 01:09:39,480
The real Belgian left
the bank 5 minutes later.

1539
01:09:39,520 --> 01:09:41,360
So where's the real Belgian?

1540
01:09:41,400 --> 01:09:44,920
I've followed him to
the Columbian's villa in Cannes.

1541
01:09:44,960 --> 01:09:46,640
The Belgian and
the Columbian together.

1542
01:09:46,680 --> 01:09:48,080
/Can you imagine
/such a catch?

1543
01:09:48,120 --> 01:09:50,200
General alarm!

1544
01:09:57,160 --> 01:09:58,560
You look sublime, my dear.

1545
01:09:58,600 --> 01:09:59,280
Thank you.

1546
01:09:59,320 --> 01:10:00,840
And you look great in white.

1547
01:10:00,880 --> 01:10:01,760
You think so?

1548
01:10:02,400 --> 01:10:03,240
I like white.

1549
01:10:03,640 --> 01:10:04,600
I like white...

1550
01:10:05,240 --> 01:10:06,480
But I prefer champagne.

1551
01:10:12,120 --> 01:10:14,280
- Did you hear those shots?
- I heard only one.

1552
01:10:14,320 --> 01:10:17,000
Trust me. One shot is usually
followed by others.

1553
01:10:17,040 --> 01:10:17,920
What are you doing?

1554
01:10:17,960 --> 01:10:20,360
I'll take up a forward position
and prepare the terrain for Gibert.

1555
01:10:20,400 --> 01:10:21,880
You'd be better off
guarding the rear.

1556
01:10:21,920 --> 01:10:24,800
Don't worry. I'll inspect
the topography of the terrain.

1557
01:10:24,840 --> 01:10:27,000
So that special forces
can penetrate easily.

1558
01:10:27,040 --> 01:10:28,480
Here.
Put this in your ear.

1559
01:10:28,920 --> 01:10:30,760
You'll be able to
monitor me from afar.

1560
01:10:38,360 --> 01:10:39,960
I have a bad
feeling about this.

1561
01:10:41,720 --> 01:10:42,640
To us.

1562
01:10:54,320 --> 01:10:55,800
/There's a high fence.

1563
01:10:56,240 --> 01:10:57,440
I'm climbing up a post.

1564
01:10:58,360 --> 01:11:00,720
There's a tree branch
that reaches into the estate.

1565
01:11:00,760 --> 01:11:02,560
/That's strange.
/Such branches are usually sawed.

1566
01:11:02,600 --> 01:11:03,720
But this one isn't.

1567
01:11:03,760 --> 01:11:04,240
Actually...

1568
01:11:04,400 --> 01:11:05,160
It is.

1569
01:11:09,280 --> 01:11:12,120
That was a topography class
presented by Emilien.

1570
01:11:12,160 --> 01:11:13,000
Let's dance.

1571
01:11:30,040 --> 01:11:31,920
Do you realize what
a couple we'll make?

1572
01:11:31,960 --> 01:11:33,080
Fire and ice.

1573
01:11:33,360 --> 01:11:35,280
My Machiavellism
and your professionalism.

1574
01:11:35,600 --> 01:11:37,640
We'll be the most feared
couple of modern times.

1575
01:11:38,200 --> 01:11:40,800
I'll be your Clyde
and you'll be my Bonnie.

1576
01:11:42,360 --> 01:11:43,560
Shall we dance or kiss?

1577
01:11:43,600 --> 01:11:44,720
We can do both.

1578
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:47,320
Otherwise I'll come to believe
you're a double agent.

1579
01:11:53,920 --> 01:11:56,160
Haven't you learned
to knock when entering?

1580
01:11:56,360 --> 01:11:57,360
I'm sorry, boss.

1581
01:11:57,400 --> 01:11:59,160
But look what
fell out of the sky.

1582
01:11:59,800 --> 01:12:01,600
Well, well. It's the little
cop from Marseille.

1583
01:12:01,680 --> 01:12:02,960
That little cop is an inspector.

1584
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:04,280
I won't let you
get away with this.

1585
01:12:04,320 --> 01:12:06,360
Hands in the air!
You're under arrest!

1586
01:12:08,120 --> 01:12:09,680
You know, you're really stupid.

1587
01:12:09,800 --> 01:12:11,240
Barging in here
with your little gun

1588
01:12:11,280 --> 01:12:13,320
and believing you can arrest
the public enemy no. 1.

1589
01:12:13,680 --> 01:12:15,880
The killer of the Flanders.
The monster of Belgium.

1590
01:12:17,520 --> 01:12:18,840
I warn you.
The house is surrounded.

1591
01:12:18,880 --> 01:12:19,840
Really?

1592
01:12:19,880 --> 01:12:20,680
Right.

1593
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:21,920
Reinforcements.

1594
01:12:22,600 --> 01:12:23,680
An armada.

1595
01:12:24,440 --> 01:12:27,080
I can hear the helicopters
circling the house.

1596
01:12:28,240 --> 01:12:30,200
- They'll be here any moment.
- Very good.

1597
01:12:30,360 --> 01:12:31,320
We'll be waiting for them.

1598
01:12:31,760 --> 01:12:33,560
I'll show you what
we'll welcome them with.

1599
01:12:36,400 --> 01:12:38,640
But first you'll pay
for disturbing my peace!

1600
01:12:38,680 --> 01:12:39,560
Leave him to me.

1601
01:12:39,600 --> 01:12:41,560
I've always dreamed
of killing a cop.

1602
01:12:41,600 --> 01:12:42,800
And I was off
to a good start.

1603
01:12:42,840 --> 01:12:43,280
Fine.

1604
01:12:43,320 --> 01:12:45,800
This will be my engagement
gift for you, my rose.

1605
01:12:45,840 --> 01:12:49,040
No other gift will
make me happier.

1606
01:12:49,800 --> 01:12:50,960
Miss, please listen to me...

1607
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:53,280
- Mrs.
- Mrs., if you prefer.

1608
01:12:53,320 --> 01:12:56,040
I've never hit a woman
and I practiced judo for 8 years.

1609
01:13:00,120 --> 01:13:01,320
That was a Japanese hold.

1610
01:13:04,440 --> 01:13:06,560
Since you insist,
I'll take this seriously.

1611
01:13:06,600 --> 01:13:08,920
OK.
But open your eyes.

1612
01:13:08,960 --> 01:13:10,440
Don't worry about me.

1613
01:13:10,680 --> 01:13:12,640
But I am worried about you.

1614
01:13:14,880 --> 01:13:15,720
Do we know each other?

1615
01:13:16,560 --> 01:13:17,560
Think harder.

1616
01:13:19,840 --> 01:13:22,320
I don't know that hold,
but that must have hurt.

1617
01:13:22,440 --> 01:13:25,520
Reinforcements better come quick
or there won't be much left of him.

1618
01:13:28,840 --> 01:13:30,240
Do you like my girlfriend?

1619
01:13:30,600 --> 01:13:31,760
She's not my type.

1620
01:13:34,160 --> 01:13:36,240
And would you like me more
if I were a blonde?

1621
01:13:37,240 --> 01:13:37,960
Petra?

1622
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:39,280
I was sure that I know her.

1623
01:13:39,320 --> 01:13:40,520
It took you awhile.

1624
01:13:43,360 --> 01:13:44,280
Finally.

1625
01:13:44,480 --> 01:13:46,200
Gibert and his orchestra.

1626
01:13:48,240 --> 01:13:50,640
Boss, should I check if
the front gate isn't open?

1627
01:13:50,680 --> 01:13:52,520
You might as well use
the door bell.

1628
01:13:53,080 --> 01:13:55,920
The success of an operation hinges
on the element of surprise.

1629
01:13:55,960 --> 01:13:59,200
And thanks to this catapult system
we will jump over the fence!

1630
01:14:00,800 --> 01:14:02,520
That was the
Swedish corkscrew.

1631
01:14:03,240 --> 01:14:03,840
/Go on.

1632
01:14:03,960 --> 01:14:04,760
Show him.

1633
01:14:04,880 --> 01:14:05,880
Break his neck.

1634
01:14:05,960 --> 01:14:06,840
Finish him.

1635
01:14:07,400 --> 01:14:08,680
I have a knife
on my right thigh.

1636
01:14:08,720 --> 01:14:10,280
- Take me as a hostage.
- What?

1637
01:14:11,080 --> 01:14:12,520
Turn around and take me.

1638
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:14,280
In front of everyone?

1639
01:14:14,840 --> 01:14:16,240
Take me as a hostage,
you idiot.

1640
01:14:19,160 --> 01:14:20,440
He's holding a knife
on my throat.

1641
01:14:20,520 --> 01:14:21,640
Where did he get the knife?

1642
01:14:21,680 --> 01:14:23,280
I did a whole body
search and found nothing.

1643
01:14:23,320 --> 01:14:24,760
If you move,
I'll slit her throat.

1644
01:14:24,800 --> 01:14:25,720
Nobody move.

1645
01:14:25,800 --> 01:14:27,240
Don't worry, dear.
I'll deal with this.

1646
01:14:27,280 --> 01:14:27,880
Stay calm.

1647
01:14:28,040 --> 01:14:29,080
And you, little cop...

1648
01:14:29,280 --> 01:14:31,400
Tell me what you want,
and you'll have it.

1649
01:14:33,600 --> 01:14:36,600
Boss, are you sure this is safe
without a warm-up?

1650
01:14:37,320 --> 01:14:39,320
I'm warm as the breeze, Alan.

1651
01:14:39,600 --> 01:14:43,720
I took part in a trampoline
competition back in 71.

1652
01:14:43,800 --> 01:14:45,600
Exactly.
71 was a long time ago.

1653
01:14:45,640 --> 01:14:47,640
Jumping on a trampoline
is like riding a bike.

1654
01:14:47,680 --> 01:14:49,600
You never forget it.
Send the first group.

1655
01:15:02,200 --> 01:15:03,480
Betrayed by technology...

1656
01:15:03,520 --> 01:15:05,440
Alan, go to the truck
and find the problem.

1657
01:15:05,480 --> 01:15:06,160
I'm on it, boss.

1658
01:15:10,240 --> 01:15:11,560
What's your number, boss?

1659
01:15:11,600 --> 01:15:13,240
I have no idea.
I'm in last place.

1660
01:15:13,280 --> 01:15:15,840
Probably a burned-out fuse.
Find it.

1661
01:15:17,040 --> 01:15:18,920
With his weight, I'm not
surprised it doesn't work.

1662
01:15:18,960 --> 01:15:20,000
OVERLOAD

1663
01:15:20,520 --> 01:15:21,720
I found the problem, boss.

1664
01:15:50,160 --> 01:15:51,080
We have company.

1665
01:15:51,240 --> 01:15:52,480
What do we do, boss?

1666
01:15:53,640 --> 01:15:55,120
We wage war!

1667
01:16:01,960 --> 01:16:03,200
/You want to play?

1668
01:16:03,840 --> 01:16:04,800
/You want to catch me?

1669
01:16:04,840 --> 01:16:06,000
Then come and get me!

1670
01:16:15,720 --> 01:16:17,480
I'm glad I stayed in my cab.

1671
01:16:23,080 --> 01:16:24,840
I'm the no. 1 here,
do you hear me?

1672
01:16:24,880 --> 01:16:27,520
And not only of Belgium,
but of the whole world!

1673
01:16:27,640 --> 01:16:29,520
And some French cops
are not going to scare me!

1674
01:16:32,640 --> 01:16:33,320
/Let's go!

1675
01:16:35,840 --> 01:16:37,920
Come on!
I'll show you!

1676
01:16:50,800 --> 01:16:52,320
Do you know what
this Frenchie says?

1677
01:16:54,680 --> 01:16:57,160
He says you're making him mad!

1678
01:16:58,640 --> 01:16:59,960
And this little Frenchie...

1679
01:17:01,080 --> 01:17:03,160
is going to kick your ass.

1680
01:17:03,720 --> 01:17:04,920
It won't take long.

1681
01:17:23,160 --> 01:17:24,640
Daniel, help us.

1682
01:17:24,680 --> 01:17:26,120
I'm not surprised
he remembers me.

1683
01:17:29,480 --> 01:17:31,320
And who's no. 1 now?

1684
01:17:43,640 --> 01:17:46,640
This weapon is dangerous.
I'll go get something bigger.

1685
01:17:47,440 --> 01:17:49,000
- Is he nuts?
- What's he doing?

1686
01:17:49,040 --> 01:17:51,000
Guys, look what I found.

1687
01:17:52,560 --> 01:17:54,120
I saw one of these
in a movie.

1688
01:17:54,360 --> 01:17:55,240
/Ignition.

1689
01:17:55,280 --> 01:17:57,080
This guy should be
locked away.

1690
01:17:58,200 --> 01:18:00,880
I'll clean up this house.
It won't take long.

1691
01:18:23,400 --> 01:18:24,440
Help...

1692
01:18:48,520 --> 01:18:49,800
It looks better in yellow.

1693
01:18:56,520 --> 01:18:57,320
My love...

1694
01:18:57,920 --> 01:18:59,400
When I think that
I didn't recognize you

1695
01:18:59,600 --> 01:19:01,000
and that I almost hit you.

1696
01:19:01,120 --> 01:19:03,800
Don't worry.
I would have defended myself.

1697
01:19:09,160 --> 01:19:11,240
Where should I drop you off,
before matters get hot?

1698
01:19:19,720 --> 01:19:20,880
Listen, buddy.

1699
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:22,560
I won't congratulate you
for that handling.

1700
01:19:22,600 --> 01:19:23,360
Neither will I.

1701
01:19:23,720 --> 01:19:24,760
And I'm not the only one.

1702
01:19:28,920 --> 01:19:31,560
Excuse me, who among you
is the group leader?

1703
01:19:31,600 --> 01:19:32,680
Excuse me.

1704
01:19:34,240 --> 01:19:34,960
Right.

1705
01:19:36,680 --> 01:19:38,040
May I ask what
your rank is?

1706
01:19:38,080 --> 01:19:38,880
Commandant.

1707
01:19:38,920 --> 01:19:39,600
That's it?

1708
01:19:39,880 --> 01:19:42,320
Judging by your look,
I thought you were a General.

1709
01:19:42,680 --> 01:19:45,440
Surely someone doesn't like you
and is putting a spanner in the works.

1710
01:19:45,480 --> 01:19:46,440
I can take care of that.

1711
01:19:47,120 --> 01:19:48,760
I know a few influential people.

1712
01:19:48,800 --> 01:19:52,600
I buy weapons for them,
so they owe me a favor, Commandant.

1713
01:19:53,360 --> 01:19:54,000
Why not.

1714
01:19:54,320 --> 01:19:55,600
Shall we discuss this
in the car?

1715
01:19:55,880 --> 01:19:57,080
My pleasure, Commandant.

1716
01:19:57,600 --> 01:19:58,320
Load him up!

1717
01:19:59,000 --> 01:19:59,800
What are you doing?

1718
01:19:59,840 --> 01:20:00,600
Let go of me!

1719
01:20:00,640 --> 01:20:02,600
You're making a mistake!
Do you know who I am?

1720
01:20:02,640 --> 01:20:04,760
Let go of me!
You're making a mistake!

1721
01:20:11,240 --> 01:20:13,640
Young man, your behavior is
an example for others.

1722
01:20:13,680 --> 01:20:14,560
Thank you, sir.

1723
01:20:14,840 --> 01:20:17,480
But Emilien deserves the merit.
I only drove the taxi cab.

1724
01:20:17,520 --> 01:20:19,560
Besides, the meter has been
running since yesterday.

1725
01:20:20,200 --> 01:20:21,320
There's something I don't get.

1726
01:20:21,360 --> 01:20:23,080
You knew he was going
to rob that bank?

1727
01:20:23,120 --> 01:20:23,800
Yes.

1728
01:20:23,840 --> 01:20:26,880
There are hundreds of safety boxes
we can't legally open.

1729
01:20:26,960 --> 01:20:29,920
So we gave the Belgian the green light
and he opened them for us.

1730
01:20:29,960 --> 01:20:32,320
He'll get 200 years of prison
and won't notice the difference.

1731
01:20:32,360 --> 01:20:33,160
Exactly.

1732
01:20:33,200 --> 01:20:35,400
How did you know
he would escape?

1733
01:20:35,440 --> 01:20:38,680
By transferring him to you,
we were 90% sure he'd escape.

1734
01:20:39,080 --> 01:20:39,920
Really?

1735
01:20:41,240 --> 01:20:43,600
So I had my part in the
success of this operation?

1736
01:20:43,720 --> 01:20:45,720
Yes.
You were perfect.

1737
01:20:51,280 --> 01:20:53,400
Any news about Gibert?

1738
01:20:53,760 --> 01:20:56,880
Even a whole box of sleeping pills
hasn't slowed him down.

1739
01:20:56,915 --> 01:20:59,960
We'll show them!
Forward!

1740
01:21:02,920 --> 01:21:04,240
Win the match!

1741
01:21:04,480 --> 01:21:06,160
The Commissionaire is
full of energy.

1742
01:21:06,200 --> 01:21:08,200
We've tried everything
to get him to tire.

1743
01:21:08,240 --> 01:21:11,280
We signed him up for the New York marathon,
but even that didn't help.

1744
01:21:11,680 --> 01:21:13,280
Shoot!
Go on!

1745
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:19,000
What's he doing?
Is this how he plays?

1746
01:21:24,040 --> 01:21:25,040
Shoot!

1747
01:21:29,720 --> 01:21:31,440
You're not here to
pretend you're playing.

1748
01:21:31,560 --> 01:21:33,520
I'll show you
how to play.

1749
01:21:47,240 --> 01:21:48,640
Is this hard to do?

1750
01:21:49,200 --> 01:21:50,080
Look.

1751
01:21:51,040 --> 01:21:52,400
Look at this ball handling.
