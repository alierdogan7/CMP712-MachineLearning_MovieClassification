00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:11,470
<font color=#38B0DE>tan****</font>

2
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:15,320
i'm alone now.

3
00:00:15,890 --> 00:00:17,080
i'm cut off.

4
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:19,710
nowhere to run.

5
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:22,270
i had to do this.

6
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:24,840
i had to try.

7
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:31,080
i'm afraid it's all going
to end and end quietly.

8
00:00:35,510 --> 00:00:38,370
i'm afraid i'm never going to
get out of the wilderness here.

9
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:43,820
i'm afraid i've failed.

10
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:45,420
they're after me.

11
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:46,830
send help.

12
00:00:46,830 --> 00:00:50,390
after i got this message,i
kept trying to call her back.

13
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:53,010
then i called the sheriff.

14
00:00:53,770 --> 00:00:54,930
but after her message.

15
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:56,500
you don't know who to trust.

16
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:18,770
dr.shaw.

17
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:21,480
i was worried about
you speeding like that.

18
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:23,670
something were to happen to
you,why,we'd be up a creek.

19
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:24,910
sorry.

20
00:01:24,910 --> 00:01:27,990
i've got an emergency
appendectomy on the mainland.

21
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:31,860
now what's in the back?

22
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:45,680
since jessie was a child,the more in need
someone was,the more she wanted to help.

23
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:48,110
first,it was that e.r.in chicago.

24
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:51,820
then doctors without
borders in east africa.

25
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:53,510
kabul,kosovo.

26
00:01:53,510 --> 00:01:55,340
mrs.shaw,i've got to be honest with you.

27
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:57,100
we've never worked in
that part of the world.

28
00:01:57,100 --> 00:02:00,600
now,i don't know what detective simms
told you about the way we operate,but.

29
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:06,600
he said you were the best,and he said that if it were
his child,you'd be the only people he'd trust to help.

30
00:02:07,730 --> 00:02:08,900
what do we have here?

31
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:16,010
hank benson.

32
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:20,940
yeah,i thought i'd take the body to county
while i was there,get the autopsy started.

33
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:24,340
i don't think the company's
gonna like that very much.

34
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:27,480
they keep trying to tell me she's lost.

35
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:30,140
jessica's not lost.

36
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:33,420
i know my daughter.

37
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:35,370
she can handle herself.

38
00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:43,710
let's go!

39
00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:28,430
get down there.

40
00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:29,880
i want bodies,both of them.

41
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:38,860
agrius industries?

42
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:42,460
$16.2 billion in sales last year.

43
00:03:42,710 --> 00:03:48,610
industrial hardware,agriculture,biotech,and
apparently a small mining operation in tanarak,alaska.

44
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:53,540
about three hours after jessica's voice
mail,the company made an announcement

45
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:58,260
that they were going to be doing a heavy blasting
around the mines and restricting access to the island.

46
00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:00,600
so you think they're keeping
people away while they hunt for her?

47
00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:02,100
that's the way i read it.

48
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:05,260
so why would a big company like that mess
around with a smalltime country doctor?

49
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:10,340
well,jessica's mother said that the company reps have
been hassling her about the death of a mine foreman.

50
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:12,470
something about trying
to prevent an autopsy.

51
00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:14,110
autopsy?was he murdered?

52
00:04:14,110 --> 00:04:15,630
you know,that's what's strange.

53
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:17,010
i looked into it.

54
00:04:17,010 --> 00:04:19,290
the guy actually did
die of a heart attack.

55
00:04:19,290 --> 00:04:21,340
no foul play whatsoever suggested.

56
00:04:21,340 --> 00:04:22,100
that's weird.

57
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:25,320
okay,the island.

58
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:28,530
400 square miles,mostly
forest surrounding the mine.

59
00:04:28,530 --> 00:04:32,620
one access road to the mainland
here,which they've closed,

60
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:35,330
so we're gonna have to build you an
official cover to get you through,

61
00:04:35,330 --> 00:04:39,470
which is going to be very difficult since
we don't have any friends like that up there.

62
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:41,840
he's on it.

63
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:46,220
what can i say?

64
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:47,520
he likes your desk.

65
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:51,070
look,i don't know how he does what
he does and i don't give a damn,

66
00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:53,630
but up there in alaska,it's
completely insulate.

67
00:04:53,630 --> 00:04:56,010
you're not from there,you can't get in.

68
00:04:56,010 --> 00:04:56,910
you don't think he can do it?

69
00:04:56,910 --> 00:04:58,070
no,no.

70
00:04:58,070 --> 00:04:59,030
i really don't.

71
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:00,710
i'll tell you what.

72
00:05:00,710 --> 00:05:02,050
just stay here,work the corporate angle.

73
00:05:02,050 --> 00:05:05,030
it's a big company,somebody has to
know something and how we can stop it.

74
00:05:05,030 --> 00:05:06,270
paul woodruff.

75
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:09,000
who is paul woodruff?

76
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,490
alaska bureau of land
and mine development.

77
00:05:11,490 --> 00:05:14,820
guy's been on leave for a couple of months,so
you're him for the next 48 hours.enjoy.

78
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:16,670
- thank you.
- you're welcome.

79
00:05:16,670 --> 00:05:19,230

car waiting for you when you land.

80
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:22,300

00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:23,730

82
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:25,690
later,dude.

83
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,440
don't you want to know how i did it?

84
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:29,400
no.

85
00:05:29,650 --> 00:05:30,740
no?

86
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:33,250
maybe.

87
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,310
you remember what i
said about that place.

88
00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:43,310
they don't like strangers,so don't go
up there screwing around or nothing.

89
00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:45,870
just blend in and keep a low profile.

90
00:05:46,850 --> 00:05:48,400
it's me.

91
00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:53,980
yeah.

92
00:06:06,910 --> 00:06:09,200

oh,thank god you speak english.

97

i've been driving so long,i figured
i should be halfway to moscow by now.

98
00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:39,060
was that a joke?

99
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:42,800
ahah yeah,it was.

100
00:06:44,230 --> 00:06:46,640
paul woodruff,bureau of
land and mine management.

101
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:49,880
i heard you had some heavy blasting going
on down at the mine,shut the island down.

102
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:52,560
yes,sir,until the wind blows
out the dust and debris.

103
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:55,340
right,well,unfortunately someone
forgot to tell my office about that,

104
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:58,840
so would it be possible to get
some of this out of the way for me?

105
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:03,300
you just wait right there.

106
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:08,600
yeah,it's me.

107
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,260
yeah,i got a guy down here.

108
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:14,290
his name's paul woodruff the
bureau of land and mine management.

109
00:07:14,290 --> 00:07:15,800

125
00:09:15,590 --> 00:09:18,710
got eyes on a smoke column about
800 yards east of our position.

126
00:09:18,710 --> 00:09:19,890
copy that.

127
00:09:19,890 --> 00:09:21,230
get out there and report back.

128
00:09:21,230 --> 00:09:22,380
oh,you're looking for somebody.

129
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:23,340
i thought the island was evacuated.

130
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:26,270
lost touch with a surveyor yesterday.

131
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:28,590
need me to file a report?

132
00:09:29,130 --> 00:09:31,740

anywhere,don't touch anything.

00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:32,860

135
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:47,690

wing chun.black belt.

139
00:09:54,650 --> 00:09:55,640
i bet you're pretty good at it.

140
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:56,850
you don't want to find out.

141
00:09:56,850 --> 00:09:58,210
trust me.

142
00:10:45,930 --> 00:10:48,010
i'm christopher chance.your mom sent me.

143
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:49,920
- my mom?
- yeah

144
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:51,540
you're not one of them?

145
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:53,430
would we still be talking if i were?

146
00:10:56,590 --> 00:10:57,850
so what was in the syringe?

147
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:00,720
morphine.

148
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:01,550
interesting.

149
00:11:01,550 --> 00:11:03,530
next time,you might just
want to leave it empty.

150
00:11:03,530 --> 00:11:06,110
air bubble in the jugular
is lethal in seconds.

151
00:11:07,110 --> 00:11:10,210
i think i know what putting an
air bubble in the jugular does.

152
00:11:10,210 --> 00:11:12,980
i went to school for quite some
time to learn how not to do it.

153
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:14,540
so what ary yo a aop?

154
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:15,620
not exactly.

155
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:18,940
well,not at all,really.

156
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:20,720
your mom hired me to
get you off the island.

157
00:11:21,970 --> 00:11:23,140
oh,i see.

158
00:11:23,770 --> 00:11:25,340
you're a mercenary.

159
00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:29,910
there's a truck up by the side of the
road with the keys still in the ignition.

160
00:11:30,130 --> 00:11:33,320
if you want to get to it while it can still
do us some good,i suggest that we get moving.

161
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:43,350
any idea why they're after you?

162
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:45,860
hank benson.

163
00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:47,400
your patient,the guy who died?

164
00:11:47,890 --> 00:11:50,310
yeah,he was a mine foreman.

165
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:55,470
last time i came through tanarak,he complained of
labored breathing and some rash he couldn't explain,

166
00:11:55,470 --> 00:11:58,810
so i diagnosed it as allergies
and gave him an antihistamine.

167
00:11:58,810 --> 00:12:00,270
then,last week,i get a call.

168
00:12:00,270 --> 00:12:02,720
hank had dropped dead
of a pulmonary embolism.

169
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:03,610
doesn't sound right.

170
00:12:03,610 --> 00:12:04,820
really doesn't.

171
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:07,830
made no sense based on what he presented
to me when i first examined him.

172
00:12:07,830 --> 00:12:09,710
so i scheduled an
autopsy with the mainland.

173
00:12:09,710 --> 00:12:14,640
24 hours later,company men show up telling
me they want agrius to handle the autopsy.

174
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:16,410
why didn't you let them?

175
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:19,030
a man had died in my care.

176
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:22,420
a man with a wife,three children.

177
00:12:23,390 --> 00:12:24,930
and i couldn't explain
to them what happened.

178
00:12:24,930 --> 00:12:26,280
i don't get to just walk away from that.

179
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:27,940
i owed it to them.

180
00:12:29,890 --> 00:12:31,850
when the company kept
pressuring me really hard,

181
00:12:31,850 --> 00:12:36,150
it became pretty clear that whatever hank had
died of,they didn't want it coming to light.

182
00:12:37,150 --> 00:12:38,520
i couldn't let that happen.

183
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:41,410
i guess that sounds ridiculous.

184
00:12:41,830 --> 00:12:43,020
not really.

185
00:12:44,490 --> 00:12:46,420
a mercenary with a heart of gold?

186
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:51,020
i prefer death retardant specialist.

187
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:54,030
you okay?

188
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:55,360
i'm fine.

189
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:57,010
i just want to get out of here.

190
00:12:59,650 --> 00:13:01,020
you never explained
how you got into town.

191
00:13:01,020 --> 00:13:02,730
don't they have the roads blocked off?

192
00:13:02,730 --> 00:13:04,360
they sent me in with an escort.

193
00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:06,990
what happened to him?

194
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:12,420
all right,whoever he is,he's good.

195
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:14,820
tracks head this way
towards this small trail.

196
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:17,110
last radio communication
was ten minutes ago.

197
00:13:17,110 --> 00:13:18,330
that gives him quite a head start.

198
00:13:18,330 --> 00:13:20,670
top speed's a couple mimis per hour.

199
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:24,030
all right,i want cahill's
team from the south.

200
00:13:24,030 --> 00:13:25,350
thompson's from the east.

201
00:13:25,350 --> 00:13:27,030
let's tighten the noose.

202
00:13:29,430 --> 00:13:31,700
all right,winston,i got into
the company's phone records.

203
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:35,610
all the calls in and out of agrius industry
headquarters for,like,the past seven days.

204
00:13:35,610 --> 00:13:36,970
we're gonna go sing
happy birthday to janis.

205
00:13:36,970 --> 00:13:39,540
- there's cake too.
- sweet.thanks,man.

206
00:13:40,170 --> 00:13:45,310
all right,at any rate,12 hours ago,a call came
in from tanarak island,alaska,to jason banneker.

207
00:13:45,310 --> 00:13:47,790
you know who that
is,dude?that's the agrius ceo.

208
00:13:47,790 --> 00:13:49,280
so this thing goes to the top?

209
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:50,230
yep.

210
00:13:51,190 --> 00:13:53,030
okay,after they hung
up,who did the ceo call?

211
00:13:53,030 --> 00:13:54,820
banneker placed two outgoing calls.

212
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:57,300
first went to his attorney.

213
00:13:57,300 --> 00:13:58,710
well,that makes sense.

214
00:13:58,710 --> 00:14:01,860
second?second one went to
an internal number at agrius.

215
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:02,770
that's weird.

216
00:14:02,770 --> 00:14:03,870
what?

217
00:14:03,870 --> 00:14:06,570
second one went to the head
of research and development.

218
00:14:06,570 --> 00:14:09,000
a guy named dr.david patel.

219
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,950
you got a problem in a
mining town in nowhere,alaska.

220
00:14:12,950 --> 00:14:14,490
why the hell would you
call some egghead in r&d?

221
00:14:14,490 --> 00:14:15,700
that's a good question.

222
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:17,430
probably worth asking
the egghead directly.

223
00:14:17,430 --> 00:14:18,580
nah,them guys never talk.

224
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:19,630
agrius owns them.

225
00:14:19,630 --> 00:14:21,110
quitter.

226
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:22,330
i don't give up so easily,dude.

227
00:14:22,330 --> 00:14:24,900
i'll take care of dr.patel.

228
00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:27,270
listen,i gotta run.

229
00:14:27,270 --> 00:14:28,580
i'll see you later.

230
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:33,360
hey,thanks,man.

231
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:35,030
hey,do you actually work here?

232
00:14:35,030 --> 00:14:36,280
no.

233
00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:41,410
you know they're never gonna
let you through the roadblocks.

234
00:14:41,410 --> 00:14:42,550
is there a plan for that?

235
00:14:42,550 --> 00:14:43,870
yes,there is.

236
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:48,030
drive down to the marina,borrow a fishing
boat,and sort this out on the mainland.

237
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:54,820
i don't mean to sound unappreciative,but is there any
way that plan works without anyone else getting kill?

238
00:14:54,820 --> 00:14:56,230
ideally.

239
00:14:57,180 --> 00:14:58,480
i've worked in afghanistan and.

240
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:01,210
and rwanda and i've seen
a lot of people killed

241
00:15:01,210 --> 00:15:04,820
and i'm a physician and i just
would prefer it not be on my behalf.

242
00:15:08,830 --> 00:15:10,140
let's go.now

243
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:12,260
- but i thought the truck.
- truck's no longer an option.come on

244
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:18,840
there they are.

245
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:25,860
stay here.

246
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:33,870
when i fire,head that way.

247
00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:35,500
- but it's a dead end.
- trast me

248
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:51,120
oh,god.

249
00:15:51,790 --> 00:15:52,470
oh,god.

250
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:01,900
okay,so we just.

251
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:03,560
we just make them think that we jumped.

252
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:05,120
okay,how?

253
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:06,090
by jumping.

254
00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:09,650
what?are you insane?we're
never gonna make that!

255
00:16:09,650 --> 00:16:12,470
no,i mean,probably.definitely.

256
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:16,220
there they are!

257
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:17,920
on the count of three.

258
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:19,040
- one.
- oh god

259
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:31,010
isn't that what got me in
trouble in the first place?

260
00:16:31,290 --> 00:16:35,670
what got you in trouble is you never had a masal maasai 
warrior chief teach you how to build a smokeless fire.

261
00:16:36,330 --> 00:16:37,310
and you have?

262
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:39,970
dry twigs,no air underneath the tender.

263
00:16:39,970 --> 00:16:42,350
it's a little more art than
science,but once you get the.

264
00:16:43,850 --> 00:16:45,000
the hang of it.

265
00:16:45,650 --> 00:16:47,100
you should take off yours too.

266
00:16:48,630 --> 00:16:52,210
the dock is six to seven miles from
here,and wet clothes in this temperature.

267
00:16:52,610 --> 00:16:54,940
we're gonna face
hypothermia halfway there.

268
00:16:55,950 --> 00:16:56,870
okay.

269
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:02,850
shouldn't take long to
dry those things out.

270
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:08,300
in the meantime,better make sure we keep our
core temperature from going down too fast.

271
00:17:13,270 --> 00:17:15,720
yeah,we should take advantage
of whatever we have available.

272
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:17,700
our body heat.

273
00:17:18,930 --> 00:17:20,560
that's what i was gonna.

274
00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:26,780
i just want you to understand that it's.

275
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:28,630
oh,yeah,completely practical.

276
00:17:29,210 --> 00:17:30,400
i agree.

277
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:51,160
hey,dude.

278
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:52,360
mission accomplished.

279
00:17:54,260 --> 00:17:55,660
you called.you ididou had the guy.

280
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:57,550
- yeah  
- yeah

281
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:01,350
where's the guy?

282
00:18:07,990 --> 00:18:09,490
what is wrong with you?

283
00:18:09,490 --> 00:18:10,780
what?

284
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:13,550
tried asking him nicely.

285
00:18:20,510 --> 00:18:21,570
can i ask you a question?

286
00:18:21,570 --> 00:18:22,960
please.

287
00:18:23,490 --> 00:18:26,040
rwanda,afghanistan,alaska.

288
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:27,490
what's your story?

289
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:32,090
well,there's a lot of
doctors in san francisco.

290
00:18:32,450 --> 00:18:38,480
the places i've been,you're lucky if the
hospitals have four walls,let alone doctors.

291
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:43,210
do i feel like i'm pushing the
same boulder up the same hill?

292
00:18:44,060 --> 00:18:45,410
some days.

293
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:47,900
but i'm making a difference.

294
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:50,410
what else?

295
00:18:51,590 --> 00:18:53,060
that isn't enough?

296
00:18:54,570 --> 00:18:58,120
well,i've just met a lot of docs in a world
tour of hot spots,but i haven't met one

297
00:18:58,120 --> 00:19:01,240
who seemed like they're trying to
get lost or leave something behind.

298
00:19:03,370 --> 00:19:05,000
i doubt you're the first.

299
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:16,350
i swore an oath to help people who needed it
without any regards to what i was getting out of it.

300
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:21,670
i wouldn't expect someone
like you to understand that.

301
00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:23,440
someone like me?

302
00:19:24,350 --> 00:19:27,300
i've known a lot of
mercenaries from my world tour,

303
00:19:28,430 --> 00:19:33,230
ani haven't met one yet who wouldn't sell out whatever
cause he was fighting for if the price was right.

304
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:36,950
somehow i doubt you're the first.

305
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:41,710
we should probably get going.

306
00:19:52,770 --> 00:19:54,160
here you go,doctor.

307
00:19:55,670 --> 00:19:58,370
sorry about,you know,him.

308
00:20:02,010 --> 00:20:03,060
are you going to kill me?

309
00:20:03,060 --> 00:20:04,630
no.

310
00:20:05,210 --> 00:20:07,010
then what's he doing with my phone?

311
00:20:07,010 --> 00:20:09,410
dr.patel,i'm gonna need
to ask you a few questions.

312
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,390
a week ago,you were on a phone call
with the ceo of agrius industries.

313
00:20:15,390 --> 00:20:17,120
i need to know what that
phone call was about.

314
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:19,380
i can't talk about that.

315
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:22,030
i've got nondisclosures,a
confidentiality agreement.

316
00:20:22,030 --> 00:20:23,330
wait,wait,wait,wait!

317
00:20:24,230 --> 00:20:25,960
come on,man.

318
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:32,640
a mine foreman died a few
days ago in tanak,alaska.

319
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:35,640
not a cavein.not a mishap.not
an accident.not foul play.

320
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:39,430
now,ever since then,agrius industries
has been doing everything in its power

321
00:20:39,430 --> 00:20:43,980
to make sure the cause of this man's death is
kept a secret,including trying to kill his doctor.

322
00:20:45,130 --> 00:20:48,770
now i believe the phone call you were on is
connected to that in some way,and i need to know how.

323
00:20:51,710 --> 00:20:53,430
five or six years ago.

324
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:57,060
agrius patented a
chemical called propalyde.

325
00:20:57,310 --> 00:20:58,510
what is it?

326
00:20:58,510 --> 00:21:00,790
it's a ticking time bomb.

327
00:21:06,170 --> 00:21:07,390
sector five is clear.

328
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:09,290
get on to the harbor.

329
00:21:09,290 --> 00:21:10,920
no boat leaves the
island without my okay.

330
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:12,260
copy that.

331
00:21:24,070 --> 00:21:25,970
let's see if i can get
ahold of my partner.

332
00:21:25,970 --> 00:21:27,600
a cell phone's not gonna
work.the towers are down.

333
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:28,750
we'll go straight to the satellite.

334
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:29,870
how?

335
00:21:29,870 --> 00:21:33,420
dial 4155550112.

336
00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:35,350
on star dialing now.

337
00:21:35,350 --> 00:21:37,080
please hold.

338
00:21:40,150 --> 00:21:41,230
where the hell are you?

339
00:21:41,230 --> 00:21:41,850
we're on our way to the harbor.

340
00:21:41,850 --> 00:21:42,980
i've got jessica.

341
00:21:42,980 --> 00:21:44,840
well,that's good.

342
00:21:45,510 --> 00:21:46,680
what's the problem?

343
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:48,410
i don't know if you're
gonna be able to get out.

344
00:21:48,410 --> 00:21:49,740
what are you talking about?

345
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:54,760
when jessica tried to leave with that body,it set off all
kinds of alarms at agrius about something called propalyde.

346
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:56,080
propalyde?

347
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:57,820
yeah,it's an industrial solvent.

348
00:21:57,820 --> 00:22:02,990
it's got a lot of uses,including mining,and it's a
hell of a lot more toxic than anyone cares to admit.

349
00:22:02,990 --> 00:22:04,480
that's what killed hank.

350
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:10,650
well,if it is,his death could be the first in what
could amount to a billiondollar tort against agrius.

351
00:22:10,650 --> 00:22:12,010
they gotta contain it.

352
00:22:12,010 --> 00:22:13,610
they gotta erase any evidence that it
was on the island before it gets out.

353
00:22:13,610 --> 00:22:16,950
but right now,i'm the
only evidence that's left.

354
00:22:18,130 --> 00:22:18,810
what if we got other proof?

355
00:22:18,810 --> 00:22:21,500
evidence that her patient
was exposed to this chemical?

356
00:22:22,060 --> 00:22:23,300
like what?

357
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:24,890
soil samples from the mine.

358
00:22:25,370 --> 00:22:26,250
proves he had exposure.

359
00:22:26,250 --> 00:22:29,460
that plus the doctor who treated him
could tell a pretty convincing story.

360
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:31,190
will it be enough?

361
00:22:31,770 --> 00:22:33,200
it's gonna have to be.

362
00:22:37,220 --> 00:22:40,280
if we get to the boat
and off the island.

363
00:22:41,190 --> 00:22:43,380
this doesn't end,does it?

364
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:47,030
you know enough to be dangerous,but
not enough to stop them.

365
00:22:47,030 --> 00:22:49,000
if you can keep pushing,other
dominoes will fall.

366
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:53,780
they can't contain this and they know it,and they're
never gonna stop coming after you unless we stay.

367
00:22:54,250 --> 00:22:56,800
we get the proof we need
to expose their coverup.

368
00:23:01,870 --> 00:23:03,670
these people have done enough.

369
00:23:04,230 --> 00:23:05,840
i want to see this end.

370
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:07,810
for good.

371
00:23:10,610 --> 00:23:11,670
winston?

372
00:23:11,670 --> 00:23:13,090
there's an airfield near the mine.

373
00:23:13,090 --> 00:23:15,390
who do we know that can get a plane
to the ground within four hours?

374
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:21,210
four hours' notice to get you out of a hot zone
with a professional kill squad shooting at you?

375
00:23:21,790 --> 00:23:22,900
nobody you'd want to.

376
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:24,830
what about that guy from
seattle,fred something?

377
00:23:24,830 --> 00:23:25,720
frank.

378
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:26,820
deceased.

379
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:28,040
harris from calgary?

380
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:29,950
also deceased.

381
00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:32,960
what about that flight
instructor from coeur d'alene?

382
00:23:33,540 --> 00:23:35,400
the one with the glass eye?

383
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:39,100
he's too far away and,you know,dead.

384
00:23:39,710 --> 00:23:40,440
maybe i could.

385
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:41,380
you know what?

386
00:23:41,380 --> 00:23:42,690
you be at that airstrip in four hours.

387
00:23:42,690 --> 00:23:44,340
i'll figure something out.

388
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:10,730
okay,check the desk,look for work schedules,call
logs,anything that might have hank's name on it.

389
00:24:10,730 --> 00:24:13,430
how do we know they haven't destroyed
everything that has his name on it?

390
00:24:13,430 --> 00:24:14,370
we don't.

391
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,090
what?

392
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:25,360
what?i'm starving.

393
00:24:28,730 --> 00:24:30,020
oh,work schedule.

394
00:24:33,090 --> 00:24:34,950
hank benson.shaft 183.

395
00:24:37,290 --> 00:24:38,010
okay.

396
00:24:38,010 --> 00:24:40,690
183.it's on the eastern slope.

397
00:24:44,490 --> 00:24:46,170
come on,doctor.

398
00:24:46,170 --> 00:24:48,840
no lab work?no tissue
samples?not even a damn memo?

399
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:53,670
look,i'm telling you,the records of our propalyde
testing were just cleared out of our offices.

400
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:56,870
i was told it was to
arrange for safe storage.

401
00:24:56,870 --> 00:24:58,140
but who knows where it went?

402
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:00,560
there is nothing that
can document any of this.

403
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:01,380
listen to me.

404
00:25:01,380 --> 00:25:03,090
if we don't get something that proves
the company knew about propalyde,

405
00:25:03,090 --> 00:25:07,340
we're never going to be able to get the kind
of leverage we're going to need over them.

406
00:25:10,220 --> 00:25:13,520
this number appears in your call logs
four times over the last seven days.

407
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:14,500
there's no name.

408
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:15,420
who is it?

409
00:25:18,580 --> 00:25:20,290
tell me the truth.

410
00:25:21,730 --> 00:25:23,800
his name is jon taggart.

411
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:24,840
that's what i figured.

412
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:26,370
who is jon taggart?

413
00:25:26,370 --> 00:25:27,510
he's a fixer.

414
00:25:27,510 --> 00:25:29,760
corporate espionage.evidence scrubber.

415
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:33,430
agrius definitely hired this guy to
make the evidence go away on propalyde.

416
00:25:34,740 --> 00:25:36,770
so what did he say to you
when he talked to you last?

417
00:25:36,770 --> 00:25:38,290
keeeeyour mouth shut.you signed an nda.

418
00:25:38,290 --> 00:25:39,120
blah,blah,blah.

419
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:40,550
that sort of thing?am i close?

420
00:25:40,550 --> 00:25:42,410
yeah,that's exactly what he said.

421
00:25:44,330 --> 00:25:45,510
you know this person?

422
00:25:45,510 --> 00:25:46,810
yeah,he's kind of a shark.

423
00:25:46,810 --> 00:25:49,180
no real code.a real sleazebag.

424
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:52,880
i'm sorry.you say he's a real sleazebag?

425
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:54,920
- yeah 
- oh,got you.

426
00:25:57,040 --> 00:26:00,010
but if we can get to him,he'll
have the evidence we need.

427
00:26:10,730 --> 00:26:13,000
any idea what this
propalyde stuff looks like?

428
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,030
no.

429
00:26:14,030 --> 00:26:15,660
all we know is that
it killed your patient?

430
00:26:15,660 --> 00:26:16,690
pretty much.

431
00:26:16,690 --> 00:26:18,530
should we be worried about that?

432
00:26:18,530 --> 00:26:22,190
well,hank was exposed to high
doses over a month or two.

433
00:26:22,190 --> 00:26:23,670
we'll be fine.

434
00:26:23,670 --> 00:26:25,950
not sure i believe you,but
i do like your style.

435
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:31,160
is this how it really works?

436
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:34,410
shovel a crime into a deep,dark
hole,hope nobody finds out about it?

437
00:26:34,410 --> 00:26:35,940
happens more than you think.

438
00:26:39,380 --> 00:26:40,780
here.

439
00:26:43,670 --> 00:26:45,020
this wood is new.

440
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:46,920
whoever closed it was in a hurry.

441
00:26:57,170 --> 00:26:58,880
obviously they beat us here.

442
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:00,240
i don't understand.

443
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:02,140
why didn't she try to
make it off the island?

444
00:27:02,660 --> 00:27:04,120
why'd she come here?

445
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:07,220
she's looking for proof.

446
00:27:08,750 --> 00:27:11,250
mine shaft 183,we finish
prerigging it to blow?

447
00:27:11,990 --> 00:27:15,400
good.send howe and stanton to the
entrance.make sure no one gets out.

448
00:27:15,990 --> 00:27:17,820
let's put an end to this.

449
00:27:33,620 --> 00:27:36,680
if this is it,they didn't do
a very good job of hiding it.

450
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:38,850
maybe they're not done.

451
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:57,600
all right.

452
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:58,900
we've gotta get out of here.

453
00:27:58,900 --> 00:28:00,590
we've gotta get to that airfield.

454
00:28:07,850 --> 00:28:09,040
what is that?

455
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:11,060
that's a preblast warning.

456
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:13,760
- but the exit's that way. 
- not anymore

457
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:37,630
are you okay?

458
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:40,170
i think so.

459
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:49,240
i don't suppose you know
your way around here,do you?

460
00:28:50,820 --> 00:28:52,910
maybe there's some loose
rocks we could move.

461
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:54,920
oh,god.

462
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:55,990
what?

463
00:28:57,190 --> 00:28:58,200
i.

464
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:00,370
something just got lodged in there.

465
00:29:00,370 --> 00:29:01,740
you think?

466
00:29:02,030 --> 00:29:03,220
all right,sit down.

467
00:29:03,220 --> 00:29:04,280
now.

468
00:29:11,470 --> 00:29:12,710
sorry.

469
00:29:15,540 --> 00:29:16,990
just wait a second.

470
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:19,170
we're gonna have to pull this one out.

471
00:29:19,170 --> 00:29:20,770
oh,it's not that bad,is it?

472
00:29:20,770 --> 00:29:22,300
it'll just work itself out.

473
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:25,770
what is this?is this bullet wounds?

474
00:29:26,580 --> 00:29:27,560
yeah.

475
00:29:30,790 --> 00:29:32,600
this one looks like barbed wire.

476
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:33,860
no.

477
00:29:34,420 --> 00:29:35,240
no,wait.

478
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:36,870
yes.

479
00:29:37,450 --> 00:29:38,770
sarajevo.

480
00:29:42,020 --> 00:29:45,900
i.i don't even know what this one is.

481
00:29:47,910 --> 00:29:50,550
oh,that's a masal ngulu blade.

482
00:29:51,130 --> 00:29:52,540
seriously?

483
00:29:58,170 --> 00:30:02,530
in chicago,um,i had a
patient named jose ortega.

484
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:04,980
acute liver failure.

485
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:14,810
i knew how to treat him,but the hospital and the
hmo,they kept pushing me to find a cheaper way out.

486
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:20,760
i was the only one standing
between him and them.

487
00:30:22,940 --> 00:30:24,710
and you caved.

488
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:28,140
i let myself be talked into it.

489
00:30:29,030 --> 00:30:32,600
i believed them when they said
they wanted what was best for him.

490
00:30:33,050 --> 00:30:37,990
i swore from then on i would never walk
away from somebody i had to protect.

491
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:41,300
no matter the cost.

492
00:30:43,730 --> 00:30:45,940
ngulu blade's a lot easier to get over.

493
00:30:48,990 --> 00:30:50,560
how would you know?

494
00:30:52,130 --> 00:30:53,870
'cause i've been there too.

495
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:57,330
sorry.

496
00:30:57,330 --> 00:30:58,670
for what?

497
00:31:07,780 --> 00:31:08,950
thank you.

498
00:31:13,980 --> 00:31:15,380
you hear that?

499
00:31:17,740 --> 00:31:19,060
that hissing?

500
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:21,150
yeah.

501
00:31:22,910 --> 00:31:24,460
explosion must have.

502
00:31:25,130 --> 00:31:27,170
severed one of the vent pipes.

503
00:31:28,350 --> 00:31:28,960
what's it venting?

504
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:30,530
good question.

505
00:31:32,330 --> 00:31:34,980
must be carbon monoxide.it's
collecting up here.

506
00:31:35,490 --> 00:31:36,740
there's no other way out.

507
00:31:38,470 --> 00:31:39,850
not yet.

508
00:32:06,900 --> 00:32:08,100
hey,taggart.

509
00:32:09,340 --> 00:32:10,400
been a while.

510
00:32:12,150 --> 00:32:13,810
what?

511
00:32:19,180 --> 00:32:20,220
oh,yeah.i get it.

512
00:32:20,220 --> 00:32:22,250
i mean,i could be recording this,right?

513
00:32:22,930 --> 00:32:24,880
if i were you,i wouldn't
say a word either.

514
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:26,250
so here's the deal.

515
00:32:26,550 --> 00:32:28,430
i know you're working with agrius.

516
00:32:28,430 --> 00:32:30,960
you're scrubbing evidence
over this whole propalyde mess.

517
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:35,330
and i also know,dude,even if you destroyed
it all,you kept one folder for yourself.

518
00:32:36,070 --> 00:32:38,510
the one with the
really good stuff in it.

519
00:32:38,510 --> 00:32:41,530
the one that guarantees you get paid
on time,they never mess with you.

520
00:32:41,530 --> 00:32:42,860
problem is this.

521
00:32:43,820 --> 00:32:45,800

for you to be anywhere near it when it do.

523
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:50,630

helped a really good person out of a rotten situation?

529
00:33:04,150 --> 00:33:05,460

530
00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:07,920

back booth by the can.all right?

534
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:19,280

541
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:43,440

what the hell was that?

545
00:34:05,020 --> 00:34:06,710
sounded like a secondary explosion.

546
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:08,500
give me the map.

547
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:11,790

548
00:34:12,390 --> 00:34:13,870

549
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:16,940

550
00:34:16,940 --> 00:34:20,140

no.

554
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:34,690
not another cliff.

555
00:34:34,690 --> 00:34:36,340
- it's just a little one.come on.

556
00:34:43,050 --> 00:34:44,280
see?

557
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:45,460
it's not so bad.

558
00:35:04,370 --> 00:35:05,550
take the wheel.

559
00:35:29,630 --> 00:35:30,730
get down!

560
00:35:31,130 --> 00:35:32,320
chance,the other side!

561
00:36:12,100 --> 00:36:13,660
come on.we're going.

562
00:36:13,660 --> 00:36:15,300
going?going where?

563
00:37:01,310 --> 00:37:02,680
who the hell are you?

564
00:37:04,270 --> 00:37:05,540
aw,that doesn't matter.

565
00:37:05,540 --> 00:37:07,010
i know who you are,though.

566
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:11,290
you're jason banneker,ceo
of agrius industries.

567
00:37:13,190 --> 00:37:14,800
it says it in this too.

568
00:37:18,870 --> 00:37:20,030
where'd you get these?

569
00:37:20,030 --> 00:37:21,550
well,i hate to ruin the surprise.

570
00:37:21,550 --> 00:37:23,340
it's all gonna come out at your trial.

571
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:25,080
come on,jason.

572
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:26,380
you knew what happened to that miner.

573
00:37:26,380 --> 00:37:29,170
you knew propalyde was
toxic and then you hid it.

574
00:37:31,290 --> 00:37:33,790
so here's how it's gonna
go for you and agrius.

575
00:37:33,790 --> 00:37:35,310
you're gonna get raked over the coals.

576
00:37:35,790 --> 00:37:37,690
your stock price is going
right in the crapper.

577
00:37:37,690 --> 00:37:38,950
fines.

578
00:37:38,950 --> 00:37:41,600
payout to hank benson's family
is gonna make your head swim

579
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:48,210
and then you are gonna have a nice extended
stay at eglin minimum security prison.

580
00:37:48,210 --> 00:37:51,620
that's pretty much set in stone as
far as you're concerned,believe that.

581
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:53,970
and if you're lucky.

582
00:37:55,100 --> 00:37:57,030
well,that'll be the end.

583
00:37:58,970 --> 00:38:00,370
get on with it.

584
00:38:02,130 --> 00:38:06,060
i can make sure you go away for
conspiracy to murder jessica shaw.

585
00:38:07,780 --> 00:38:09,470
only it won't be at federal summer camp.

586
00:38:09,470 --> 00:38:10,570
it'll be at lompoc.

587
00:38:10,570 --> 00:38:13,640
you know,for real prison.

588
00:38:14,260 --> 00:38:14,790
two to a cell.

589
00:38:14,790 --> 00:38:16,950
ten to a shower.trust me.

590
00:38:16,950 --> 00:38:19,730
you wouldn't do well there at all.

591
00:38:22,340 --> 00:38:24,080
what exactly is it you want?

592
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:26,840
couple things.

593
00:38:28,230 --> 00:38:29,480
one.

594
00:38:31,490 --> 00:38:33,980
nobody messes with jessica shaw.

595
00:38:34,790 --> 00:38:37,000
not during the propalyde trial.

596
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:38,710
ever.

597
00:38:39,580 --> 00:38:44,400
and two,you take out your checkbook and
write a check out to me for whatever's in it.

598
00:38:44,860 --> 00:38:48,480
now you do that and the murder
will just stay in my pocket.

599
00:38:51,140 --> 00:38:52,970
but you mess around.

600
00:38:55,270 --> 00:38:56,980
bye,jason.

601
00:39:12,470 --> 00:39:14,190
so who do i make this out to?

602
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:28,530
hey,do you mind?

603
00:39:28,980 --> 00:39:30,170

604
00:39:30,170 --> 00:39:32,980
you know,i don't know if you
noticed it,but i'm working here.

605
00:39:32,980 --> 00:39:35,340
i'm trying to clean up
another one of your messy.

606
00:39:37,430 --> 00:39:38,750
tracks.

607
00:39:39,010 --> 00:39:40,670
hey,you want to take carmine for a walk?

608
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:43,210
no.

609
00:39:43,740 --> 00:39:46,210
neither do i,so this is
how he gets his exercise.

610
00:39:47,140 --> 00:39:48,330
lucky dog.

611
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:00,550

613
00:40:04,870 --> 00:40:06,040

614
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:07,120
no,no,no.

615
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:08,840
he's just always grumpy like that.

616
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:13,270
so what's up?

617
00:40:13,270 --> 00:40:14,660
i was just in the area.

618
00:40:14,660 --> 00:40:15,980
went to see my mother.

619
00:40:16,740 --> 00:40:17,760
how is she?

620
00:40:18,130 --> 00:40:19,150
grateful.

621
00:40:19,150 --> 00:40:20,290

622
00:40:20,290 --> 00:40:21,540

624
00:40:27,060 --> 00:40:28,970
what makes you think
i'm not sticking around?

625
00:40:28,970 --> 00:40:33,930
well,you don't really strike me as a pursecarrying
kind of woman,but you're carrying a pue.

626
00:40:33,930 --> 00:40:36,220
bandaid on your arm says you
probably just got a vaccination.

627
00:40:36,220 --> 00:40:38,220
i'm guessing yellow fever.

628
00:40:38,220 --> 00:40:40,980
comfortable clothes,travel shoes.

629
00:40:42,130 --> 00:40:44,120
your mom told me.

630
00:40:50,900 --> 00:40:52,250
thanks again.

631
00:40:58,430 --> 00:41:02,130

dakar,just give me a shout.

632
00:41:06,590 --> 00:41:10,160

bistro on medina street.

633
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:14,220
well,it's worth checking out.

634
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:17,250

635
00:41:22,820 --> 00:41:24,770
oh,one more thing.

636
00:41:33,970 --> 00:41:36,380
a little somehing
from agrius industries.

637
00:41:40,590 --> 00:41:41,710
what's this for?

638
00:41:41,710 --> 00:41:44,060
that's some travel money.

639
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:47,350
so you can keep pushing
your boulder uphill.

640
00:41:52,450 --> 00:41:53,500
thank you.

641
00:42:07,790 --> 00:42:09,260
