AssaIam aIaikum,
Peter.

341
00:29:29,934 --> 00:29:31,268
What is it?

342
00:29:31,895 --> 00:29:33,353
Spindrift coming off the top.

343
00:29:34,063 --> 00:29:37,399
That's local. If something
was coming in, it'd show
on the other peaks.

344
00:29:37,984 --> 00:29:41,403
Your sister's fine, man.
You look after yourself.

345
00:29:41,738 --> 00:29:45,574
You too.
Thanks for everything.

00:31:01,734 --> 00:31:05,612
FRANK [OVER RADIO]:
Understood, Tom.
You guys take good care up there.

347
00:31:05,989 --> 00:31:08,824
Thanks, base. Out.

348
00:31:10,618 --> 00:31:12,119
Well, you heard it.

349
00:31:16,124 --> 00:31:18,125
Computer model shows
it's building.

350
00:31:18,334 --> 00:31:20,502
That's a concern.

351
00:31:21,296 --> 00:31:23,046
We're about an hour from
the bottleneck, right?

352
00:31:23,214 --> 00:31:24,339
Yeah.

353
00:31:26,467 --> 00:31:28,135
Let's kick it
and get up there.

354
00:31:28,344 --> 00:31:31,388
Gets any worse,
we'll shelter under
the ice cliffs till it passes.

355
00:31:31,639 --> 00:31:35,350
If it comes in fast,
we're totally exposed out here.

356
00:31:35,602 --> 00:31:37,853
But it's not coming in fast.
He said it's slow-moving.

357
00:31:38,187 --> 00:31:40,022
There's a 70 percent
chance it'll turn east
and miss us.

358
00:31:40,189 --> 00:31:41,189
That's right.

359
00:31:41,608 --> 00:31:44,484
I'm not gonna risk a storm.
Not at 26,000.

360
00:31:44,694 --> 00:31:48,196
We're not suggesting
anything stupid.
Sure, the weather could turn.

361
00:31:48,948 --> 00:31:51,700
But the odds are with us.
We're five hours
from the summit.

362
00:31:52,368 --> 00:31:55,245
We turn back now, that's it.
We've lost our window.

363
00:31:55,538 --> 00:31:59,541
I know. Elliot, I'm aware of that.
It's my responsibility.

364
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:03,670
But I won't let a marketing campaign
compromise our safety.

365
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:06,381
You think this is
about a marketing campaign?

This is about getting
to the top.

367
00:32:11,387 --> 00:32:13,889
I don't give a shit
about the publicity.

368
00:32:15,058 --> 00:32:16,558
This is a life statement for me.

369
00:32:20,313 --> 00:32:23,899

Lenticular cloud to the southeast.
Winds at 80 knots, rising.

374
00:33:06,734 --> 00:33:10,612
Thanks, Eddie.
Tom says he's going on. Campbell,
what's base camp pressure?

375
00:33:10,863 --> 00:33:13,115
Pressure's dropped
two points in four hours.

376
00:33:13,449 --> 00:33:15,617
You made your case.
We listened. We decided.

377
00:33:15,952 --> 00:33:19,788
It's too high a risk.
Why am I here
if you don't listen to me?

378
00:33:20,123 --> 00:33:24,960
I'll assess the risk. As to why
you're here, I wonder myself.

They're going on.

381
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:34,636
The wind's hitting a dozen
peaks to the south.

We've assessed
all the satellite data.

Why are you vacillating?

How is she?

1031
01:54:53,803 --> 01:54:55,137
Amazing.

1032
01:54:56,931 --> 01:54:58,974
Talk about a will to live.

1033
01:55:32,842 --> 01:55:41,516
♪ OnIy one woman ♪

1034
01:55:42,185 --> 01:55:48,523
♪ Not the picture
Of the woman you Iove ♪♪

1035
01:55:49,067 --> 01:55:51,526
That's not a song.
It's definitely a song.

1036
01:55:51,861 --> 01:55:53,403
There's no way that's a song.

1037
01:55:53,571 --> 01:55:55,697
It's a good song.

1038
01:55:56,866 --> 01:55:59,034
A winning song, by the sound of it.

1039
01:55:59,369 --> 01:56:01,370
I think you're making it up.

1040
01:56:07,877 --> 01:56:10,295
That was a hell of a thing
you did up there.

1041
01:56:11,130 --> 01:56:12,965
Anybody else would've given up.

1042
01:56:15,051 --> 01:56:16,635
Not everybody.

1043
01:56:17,887 --> 01:56:19,554
He'd be proud of you.

1044
01:56:21,391 --> 01:56:23,475
Angry, but really proud.

1045
01:56:42,704 --> 01:56:44,037
Get some sleep.
