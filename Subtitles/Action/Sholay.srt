1
00:00:30,857 --> 00:00:33,985
- The Thakur...?
- Welcome, sir. This way...

2
00:04:18,551 --> 00:04:22,385
l knew it the moment l received
your letter, Thakur...

3
00:04:22,822 --> 00:04:23,948
...that you wished to meet me.

4
00:04:24,457 --> 00:04:25,253
l took the first available train.

5
00:04:26,359 --> 00:04:29,817
l'm putting you to
some trouble, jailer.

6
00:04:30,129 --> 00:04:32,529
Not at all, sir. Just name it...
whatever it be.

7
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,833
- l need two men.
- Two?

8
00:04:53,386 --> 00:04:55,081
Do you recognize them?

9
00:04:55,822 --> 00:04:59,781
There's hardly a prison where
they have not been held, Thakur.

10
00:05:00,793 --> 00:05:03,660
This is Veeru.
...and this is Jai.

11
00:05:04,230 --> 00:05:08,724
They're crooks, both of them.
Thieves of the first order.

12
00:05:09,068 --> 00:05:11,127
l know.

13
00:05:13,506 --> 00:05:18,375
They're just what l need
for the assignment at hand.

14
00:05:19,178 --> 00:05:22,670
l can't say what assignment
you have in mind, Thakur.

15
00:05:23,316 --> 00:05:26,308
But l can surely tell you that
they're good for nothing.

16
00:05:27,854 --> 00:05:29,947
That's not true, jailer.

17
00:05:30,289 --> 00:05:35,522
For all their vices, they
have some virtues, too.

18
00:05:36,729 --> 00:05:40,358
A fake coin is a fake, sir.
Whichever way you look at it.

19
00:05:40,666 --> 00:05:43,134
That is perhaps the difference
between man and coin.

20
00:05:44,971 --> 00:05:50,034
l clearly remember what
happened two years ago.

21
00:05:51,010 --> 00:05:54,571
l had arrested both of them
in district Jamalpur.

22
00:05:56,082 --> 00:05:59,540
We had to reach the police station
at village Tamli by dusk.

23
00:06:00,853 --> 00:06:02,684
Since no other arrangements
could be made...

24
00:06:04,190 --> 00:06:06,215
...we took a goods-train.

25
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:12,523
l had two constables with me.
And there were these crooks...

26
00:06:13,232 --> 00:06:16,133
...Jaidev and Veeru;
chained and handcuffed.

27
00:06:16,936 --> 00:06:19,928
Could you have been at the Daulatpur
police station earlier, sir?

28
00:06:20,506 --> 00:06:23,304
Yes, l was. Why did you ask?

29
00:06:23,943 --> 00:06:25,570
l remember now!

30
00:06:25,978 --> 00:06:29,607
l've been wondering where l've seen
you, ever since you've caught us.

31
00:06:30,082 --> 00:06:32,642
Remember Lalji's shop? The
provision store which we robbed?

32
00:06:33,186 --> 00:06:36,883
- Do you remember?
- The provision store? No...

33
00:06:38,858 --> 00:06:41,326
Don't you? Jai...

34
00:06:41,627 --> 00:06:43,925
Remember, we were held at
the Daulatpur police station?

35
00:06:44,730 --> 00:06:47,790
- Daulatpur?
- Yes, don't you remember?

36
00:06:48,134 --> 00:06:51,126
- When was that?
- We had robbed the grocer...

37
00:06:51,871 --> 00:06:55,204
He was the officer then...
Don't you recognize him?

38
00:06:56,409 --> 00:06:59,435
All police officers
look the same to me.

39
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:05,478
l can't help it, you know...
He's always talking nonsense.

40
00:07:07,987 --> 00:07:10,319
Since when have the two of you
been in this racket?

41
00:07:11,224 --> 00:07:15,718
You could say, we stood our own
two feet, the moment we could!

42
00:07:16,295 --> 00:07:17,284
But why must you do all this?

43
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:21,561
The reason what you're a cop for...
we into it for the money.

44
00:07:21,868 --> 00:07:25,827
Not true. l'm not a police officer
just for the money.

45
00:07:26,472 --> 00:07:29,669
l have enough of family land
to keep us going.

46
00:07:30,776 --> 00:07:34,769
But perhaps l'm fond of the
dangers involved in the game.

47
00:07:35,882 --> 00:07:37,975
We face dangers everyday, too.

48
00:07:38,818 --> 00:07:43,278
There's a difference. l take on
dangers to protect the law.

49
00:07:44,056 --> 00:07:46,616
And you do it to
break the law.

50
00:07:47,393 --> 00:07:51,193
You need to be a brave man,
in both the cases.

51
00:07:51,531 --> 00:07:52,657
Oh sure! You do need courage.

52
00:07:53,933 --> 00:07:54,763
l see.

53
00:07:56,669 --> 00:07:58,694
You guys think you're
very brave, don't you?

54
00:07:59,338 --> 00:08:02,239
You will see when
the need arises, lnspector.

55
00:08:02,708 --> 00:08:04,539
We'd at least take on
1 5 or 20 guys.

56
00:08:05,578 --> 00:08:07,102
l haven't exaggerated it,
have l?

57
00:08:08,114 --> 00:08:10,878
- Now that you've already said it...
- We deal with it!

58
00:08:22,728 --> 00:08:23,422
Bandits!

59
00:08:39,579 --> 00:08:41,012
Well, lnspector?
Want to try out our guts?

60
00:08:47,853 --> 00:08:50,253
There's still time, lnspector.
Give it a thought!

61
00:09:00,099 --> 00:09:02,693
Don't you try to escape.

62
00:09:43,376 --> 00:09:44,365
Stop the engine, driver!

63
00:09:51,384 --> 00:09:54,285
Let's move ahead!
As fast as you can!

64
00:10:20,846 --> 00:10:22,279
Charge ahead!

65
00:13:07,913 --> 00:13:10,143
Give me a swig! Quick!

66
00:15:14,573 --> 00:15:16,473
- Are you okay?
- l'm all right...

67
00:15:46,905 --> 00:15:48,998
He dares mess with Veeru!

68
00:15:56,448 --> 00:15:58,143
They've fled, the swines!

69
00:15:58,984 --> 00:15:59,973
Let's go... Come on!

70
00:16:02,621 --> 00:16:06,352
l had warned you
not to escape...

71
00:16:15,701 --> 00:16:16,565
What do you think?

72
00:16:17,503 --> 00:16:18,299
We can run away.

73
00:16:20,439 --> 00:16:21,497
Leaving him in this state?

74
00:16:22,574 --> 00:16:24,132
He's going to die, if we
leave him in this condition.

75
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:27,510
Suppose we take him
to the hospital...

76
00:16:28,047 --> 00:16:29,708
...we get sent away
for four or six months.

77
00:16:31,583 --> 00:16:33,608
- So what do you suggest?
- What do you think?

78
00:16:35,854 --> 00:16:36,411
Get it out.

79
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:44,459
lf it's Heads, we go to the hospital;
if it's Tails, we escape.

80
00:16:55,274 --> 00:16:58,675
They are criminals, no doubt.
But they're terribly brave.

81
00:17:00,045 --> 00:17:03,503
They're dangerous, because
they know how to fight back.

82
00:17:04,683 --> 00:17:07,584
They're bad... but they're human.

83
00:17:09,655 --> 00:17:14,354
Could you find these
guys for me, jailer?

84
00:17:15,461 --> 00:17:19,397
We'll easily find them, if they
are presently in some prison.

85
00:17:20,165 --> 00:17:24,295
But if they're free, it's
difficult to find such people.

86
00:23:57,329 --> 00:23:59,263
Soorma Bhopali! You're pulling
out more of the firewood.

87
00:23:59,664 --> 00:24:02,224
Naturally. You don't expect me
to put some more, do you?

88
00:24:02,734 --> 00:24:06,135
The scale says it's enough...
and you insist on more.

89
00:24:06,771 --> 00:24:08,966
Just take the wood and get going.
Give me the money...

90
00:24:10,408 --> 00:24:11,534
Here's a 2-Rupee bill.

91
00:24:11,877 --> 00:24:15,369
l can see that, but is it genuine?
Okay, it is.

92
00:24:16,815 --> 00:24:18,840
So then, good-bye.

93
00:24:20,151 --> 00:24:24,554
- Won't you return my money?
- Money? What money do you want?

94
00:24:24,923 --> 00:24:27,050
- That's a two-Rupee bill!
- The wood is worth 2 Rupees too!

95
00:24:28,026 --> 00:24:29,152
Just this much of wood
for two Rupees ?!

96
00:24:29,928 --> 00:24:33,125
Were you out to buy the whole forest
for two bucks then?

97
00:24:33,632 --> 00:24:37,432
Now look; l've had enough!
Just get going.

98
00:24:37,769 --> 00:24:41,466
l'm not Soorma Bhopali for nothing!
Okay?

99
00:24:41,773 --> 00:24:45,231
Get lost...
l wonder where they come from!

100
00:24:46,011 --> 00:24:49,606
He says the wood is too little!
Wants the forest then, does he?!

101
00:24:49,648 --> 00:24:52,344
They always come early every
morning to spoil my day!

102
00:24:52,951 --> 00:24:58,389
There, Chand! You're at your
cursed poetry again!

103
00:24:58,657 --> 00:25:00,750
Go and check if they're unloaded
the stuff from the truck yet!

104
00:25:02,093 --> 00:25:04,960
Well! Well! Are you guys
watching a drama here?

105
00:25:05,564 --> 00:25:07,862
This is no travelers' bungalow...
who are you guys?

106
00:25:12,938 --> 00:25:15,429
God Almighty! lt's you!

107
00:25:16,007 --> 00:25:17,634
How are you, Soorma Bhopali?

108
00:25:17,943 --> 00:25:20,844
l'm fine, thank you!

109
00:25:21,379 --> 00:25:23,370
But what are you guys up to?!

110
00:25:24,916 --> 00:25:25,473
Come here!

111
00:25:26,351 --> 00:25:31,118
The police have declared a reward
of 2000 Rupees for your arrest.

112
00:25:31,556 --> 00:25:36,391
lf someone watches us together,
l'll land in trouble, too!

113
00:25:36,861 --> 00:25:37,793
So please get going!

114
00:25:38,530 --> 00:25:41,158
Know what, Soorma Bhopali?
We want to go to prison.

115
00:25:41,833 --> 00:25:44,028
l hope God fulfills your wish!

116
00:25:44,636 --> 00:25:47,935
Had this been Bhopal, l'd have had
you locked up in just two minutes!

117
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:52,103
l'm not Soorma Bhopali for
nothing, you know!

118
00:25:52,410 --> 00:25:53,468
But why would anyone
need me here?

119
00:25:53,812 --> 00:25:56,406
A warrant's out in
your name in any case!

120
00:25:57,148 --> 00:26:00,345
But we want you to
have us arrested.

121
00:26:01,286 --> 00:26:02,583
What are you talking about?!

122
00:26:03,121 --> 00:26:06,818
There's a reward of 2000 Rupees
which you will get.

123
00:26:07,225 --> 00:26:13,095
Give us half the money, when
we're released from prison.

124
00:26:13,999 --> 00:26:16,194
- Do you get it?
- What are you saying!

125
00:26:16,735 --> 00:26:21,195
Have some betel-leaf;
Go on... it's great!

126
00:26:31,583 --> 00:26:33,414
Since when have they started
having a parade here?

127
00:26:33,752 --> 00:26:36,915
You've just arrived, sonny boy.
You'll get to know soon.

128
00:26:37,656 --> 00:26:38,987
This new jailer is a nasty one!

129
00:26:40,025 --> 00:26:42,687
- A nasty jailer, he says.
- There he is.

130
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:07,843
Attention, l say!

131
00:27:08,853 --> 00:27:10,582
But they're already
at attention, sir.

132
00:27:14,292 --> 00:27:16,226
l know that.

133
00:27:17,796 --> 00:27:21,323
Prisoners!
This is a warning for you!

134
00:27:22,367 --> 00:27:25,530
Everything that went unchecked
before my arrival here...

135
00:27:25,937 --> 00:27:27,700
...will no longer be tolerated!

136
00:27:30,341 --> 00:27:36,576
l've been a jailer since
the British days!

137
00:27:37,182 --> 00:27:39,343
l don't belong to the breed
of jailers...

138
00:27:39,684 --> 00:27:42,244
...who waste time, trying to
reform the prisoners!

139
00:27:43,988 --> 00:27:48,982
l know it for a fact!
You guys can't be reformed!

140
00:27:49,494 --> 00:27:52,361
How can you ever change,
when l have not changed?

141
00:27:58,536 --> 00:28:02,370
l know, my words don't
go down well with you.

142
00:28:03,975 --> 00:28:08,378
Which is why l am transferred
from every place l work in.

143
00:28:09,647 --> 00:28:16,314
But despite all my transfers...
l have not changed!

144
00:28:17,922 --> 00:28:19,719
So you'd better remember!

145
00:28:20,425 --> 00:28:24,361
Don't think l am not informed
of all that you guys are up to!

146
00:28:25,930 --> 00:28:30,924
l have spies everywhere
in the prison.

147
00:28:32,070 --> 00:28:34,231
l get a report of every moment.

148
00:28:36,074 --> 00:28:38,338
Not even a bird could
flap its wings here...

149
00:28:38,643 --> 00:28:40,406
...without my consent!

150
00:28:41,479 --> 00:28:44,607
- What the hell was that?!
- A bird... a pigeon, sir!

151
00:28:44,983 --> 00:28:46,917
What's that in my eyes...
never mind!

152
00:28:47,986 --> 00:28:51,387
This will do for today!
You may leave now.

153
00:28:56,628 --> 00:28:57,424
Let's go!

154
00:29:00,532 --> 00:29:01,692
Strange guy!

155
00:29:03,101 --> 00:29:05,126
Who could be the jailer's spy?

156
00:29:06,204 --> 00:29:09,002
l know that.
lt's the barber, Hariram.

157
00:29:09,874 --> 00:29:11,933
He's very thick with the jailer.
The swine!

158
00:29:12,777 --> 00:29:15,473
Hariram, the barber?

159
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:25,353
Go ahead and shave
my moustache, Hariram.

160
00:29:26,424 --> 00:29:28,984
lt has all been arranged!

161
00:29:29,961 --> 00:29:32,486
We get cracking tomorrow.

162
00:29:32,564 --> 00:29:36,432
How many days will it take
to make the tunnel?

163
00:29:37,402 --> 00:29:39,427
You've cut my face!

164
00:29:40,138 --> 00:29:43,938
The tunnel? lt should be
ready in about a week.

165
00:29:45,076 --> 00:29:47,237
Where are we going to
dig the tunnel from?

166
00:29:48,279 --> 00:29:51,043
lt's from Barrack No. 9.

167
00:29:51,683 --> 00:29:54,015
l hope the jailer
doesn't get to know!

168
00:29:54,819 --> 00:29:57,379
No one will hear of it!

169
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:03,889
Let's go!

170
00:30:05,763 --> 00:30:06,821
There. l'm through.

171
00:30:14,472 --> 00:30:18,806
Yes, Hariram?
What news do you bring?

172
00:30:19,344 --> 00:30:22,507
Be careful, sir. They're digging
a tunnel in the jail.

173
00:30:23,982 --> 00:30:26,849
Oh, well! A tunnel in my jail...

174
00:30:28,887 --> 00:30:31,515
What was that? A tunnel
in my jail ?!

175
00:30:31,823 --> 00:30:33,222
Yes, sir. The prisoners are
making a tunnel in the jail.

176
00:30:34,425 --> 00:30:36,552
l've been a jailer since
the days of the British!

177
00:30:37,829 --> 00:30:41,856
A tunnel in my jail, eh?

178
00:31:08,826 --> 00:31:11,590
So this is where the
tunnel is being dug!

179
00:31:12,964 --> 00:31:13,953
This is wonderful!

180
00:31:14,966 --> 00:31:18,493
But you guys seem to have
forgotten that my spies...

181
00:31:18,937 --> 00:31:22,429
...are spread out in
every part of the prison.

182
00:31:24,042 --> 00:31:25,339
And what is this?

183
00:31:27,946 --> 00:31:35,045
So this is the tool with which
you will dig the tunnel!

184
00:31:39,557 --> 00:31:47,293
l'm a jailer... from
the British days!

185
00:31:51,135 --> 00:31:52,124
Here he comes!

186
00:31:55,306 --> 00:31:57,968
- ls it all arranged then?
- Yes.

187
00:31:58,643 --> 00:32:00,838
We won't miss out this time!

188
00:32:02,180 --> 00:32:04,307
A pistol has arrived
in the prison!

189
00:32:04,849 --> 00:32:06,316
Has the pistol arrived?!

190
00:32:07,618 --> 00:32:15,923
ln just a couple of days,
the jailer and his spies...

191
00:32:22,166 --> 00:32:25,602
A pistol in my prison, eh?

192
00:32:26,004 --> 00:32:28,438
A pistol in my prison,
did you say?!

193
00:32:29,073 --> 00:32:30,768
- A revolt?!
- That's right.

194
00:32:31,142 --> 00:32:32,575
- Streams of blood?!
- Exactly.

195
00:32:32,910 --> 00:32:33,672
Guards!

196
00:32:42,253 --> 00:32:43,220
Halt!

197
00:32:44,856 --> 00:32:46,653
Search every nook and corner
of the jail!

198
00:32:47,725 --> 00:32:49,590
Half of you go in that direction.

199
00:32:50,528 --> 00:32:52,996
Half of you go there.

200
00:32:56,034 --> 00:32:59,936
The rest of you guys...
come with me!

201
00:34:10,074 --> 00:34:11,939
Here's the pistol!

202
00:34:13,878 --> 00:34:16,312
Move an inch, and...

203
00:34:18,549 --> 00:34:19,447
Guards!

204
00:34:20,284 --> 00:34:21,182
They've left.

205
00:34:23,855 --> 00:34:26,483
- Let's go to your office.
- How can l?

206
00:34:27,158 --> 00:34:28,386
You have asked me not to move!

207
00:34:29,293 --> 00:34:31,454
The first order stands cancelled.
Let's go.

208
00:34:43,141 --> 00:34:47,475
ls the jailer of the British days
so scared?

209
00:34:48,779 --> 00:34:50,576
No!

210
00:34:52,083 --> 00:34:54,608
Come and see us off
at the gate first!

211
00:35:11,102 --> 00:35:13,900
Have the gate opened.

212
00:35:22,346 --> 00:35:23,506
Open the gate.

213
00:35:33,824 --> 00:35:35,724
Here's the key.

214
00:35:38,396 --> 00:35:40,728
And here's the '' pistol'' !

215
00:35:45,970 --> 00:35:47,961
The two of them must have
tried to run away, isn't it?

216
00:35:48,739 --> 00:35:51,537
Tried to run away?
That's an understatement!

217
00:35:51,909 --> 00:35:53,467
They put their lives
into it!

218
00:35:53,811 --> 00:35:55,972
But l wasn't about
to let them go!

219
00:35:56,547 --> 00:35:58,447
As l held one of them...

220
00:35:58,883 --> 00:36:00,942
...the other tried to escape.

221
00:36:01,352 --> 00:36:04,913
l dragged him back and asked,
''Where to, feller?''

222
00:36:05,423 --> 00:36:09,359
With two stinging slaps, l ordered
them to the police station!

223
00:36:09,594 --> 00:36:11,755
That was it! They were
begging at my feet!

224
00:36:12,263 --> 00:36:14,231
Did Veeru and Jai really
beg at your feet?

225
00:36:14,532 --> 00:36:15,624
They're dangerous criminals!

226
00:36:16,100 --> 00:36:18,625
They're criminals, all right!

227
00:36:18,903 --> 00:36:23,203
But l'm not called Soorma
Bhopali for nothing!

228
00:36:23,608 --> 00:36:26,941
You can imagine!
They wept at my feet!

229
00:36:27,245 --> 00:36:30,442
And begged for forgiveness;
l'd have forgiven them, too!

230
00:36:30,748 --> 00:36:35,208
But l was furious that they had
dared to trespass my territory!

231
00:36:35,886 --> 00:36:37,683
- What happened next?
- What else?!

232
00:36:38,222 --> 00:36:39,917
You know l carry a stick!

233
00:36:40,291 --> 00:36:43,692
lt was days since l had used it.
So l got down to brass-tracks...

234
00:36:43,995 --> 00:36:47,692
...and l really thrashed them!
l gave them a terrible beating!

235
00:36:48,132 --> 00:36:49,929
- What happened next?
- What would have happened?

236
00:36:50,434 --> 00:36:54,495
l held them by their collars
and said...

237
00:36:55,606 --> 00:36:57,938
- What did you say?
- What did l ?!

238
00:36:58,442 --> 00:37:01,468
What did l say?!
Yes, l remember...

239
00:37:01,746 --> 00:37:04,579
l said, '' Do let me know if there is
something more l can do for you''

240
00:37:04,949 --> 00:37:08,248
Well, guys... have you
nothing better to do?

241
00:37:08,719 --> 00:37:11,984
You plunk yourselves here and
compel me to concoct falsehoods!

242
00:37:12,390 --> 00:37:14,790
Go and attend to your work!
Go on... lazy bums!

243
00:37:17,028 --> 00:37:21,055
Well,... l was only kidding.

244
00:37:21,699 --> 00:37:25,430
But you guys have been released
pretty quickly, haven't you?

245
00:37:25,936 --> 00:37:31,340
My word! The stint at the prison
seems to have been good for you!

246
00:37:31,942 --> 00:37:35,776
We are here to collect
our thousand Rupees.

247
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:39,049
- A thousand rupees?
- That's right. A thousand bucks.

248
00:37:39,950 --> 00:37:41,349
l see!

249
00:37:41,652 --> 00:37:45,383
l got the money the very next day
of your arrest!

250
00:37:46,023 --> 00:37:51,051
Since that day, the money has been
lying in an envelope in my pocket!

251
00:37:51,329 --> 00:37:53,194
Check it out...
it's a thousand bucks!

252
00:37:54,832 --> 00:37:56,925
Well, Soorma... see you again.

253
00:38:09,714 --> 00:38:10,942
lt's these chaps l've
been looking for.

254
00:38:11,849 --> 00:38:14,010
When does their prison term
come to an end?

255
00:38:15,086 --> 00:38:17,384
On the 1 8th of the next month.

256
00:38:23,294 --> 00:38:25,956
Could l have a beedi, guard?

257
00:38:43,347 --> 00:38:46,475
Well, lnspector? Who have you
brought to the prison today?

258
00:38:47,952 --> 00:38:51,479
l'm not an lnspector anymore.
l'm just Thakur Baldev Singh.

259
00:38:51,989 --> 00:38:57,484
Why? Have you gotten over your
fondness of playing with dangers?

260
00:38:58,295 --> 00:39:02,823
lf your bravery really makes
you so arrogant...

261
00:39:03,434 --> 00:39:07,165
...will you accept
an assignment from me?

262
00:39:07,938 --> 00:39:10,406
We accept assignments
only for money.

263
00:39:10,841 --> 00:39:12,103
How much do you want?

264
00:39:17,882 --> 00:39:18,974
What's the job?

265
00:39:20,184 --> 00:39:22,414
Why must you worry about that,
if you're really brave?

266
00:39:23,888 --> 00:39:26,550
Name the price.
And you will get it.

267
00:39:27,925 --> 00:39:30,155
Provided you do what
l want you to do.

268
00:39:32,563 --> 00:39:36,090
Gabbar Singh?!
The notorious bandit?!

269
00:39:36,534 --> 00:39:38,399
Yes. He's the one.

270
00:39:39,003 --> 00:39:41,563
The police are even said to have
placed a reward on his head.

271
00:39:41,972 --> 00:39:45,703
50,000 Rupees... for capturing him
dead or alive.

272
00:39:46,811 --> 00:39:50,747
You've got to capture the
bandit for me... alive.

273
00:39:52,116 --> 00:39:55,984
You want us to get Gabbar Singh...
that too, alive and kicking!

274
00:39:56,287 --> 00:39:59,415
Gabbar Singh is no sheep-kid
we could run and catch, Thakur!

275
00:39:59,957 --> 00:40:02,755
l know it's a difficult task.

276
00:40:03,327 --> 00:40:06,785
But no one pays so much
for something easy.

277
00:40:07,364 --> 00:40:11,130
Let's suppose we risk our lives and
somehow manage to capture him.

278
00:40:11,769 --> 00:40:14,966
Do you want us to hand him over
to you for just 20,000 Rupees?

279
00:40:15,639 --> 00:40:17,300
So you can make a cool
50,000 Rupees, for nothing?

280
00:40:18,175 --> 00:40:20,268
The reward from the police
will go to you, too.

281
00:40:20,945 --> 00:40:23,470
l only want Gabbar.

282
00:40:24,515 --> 00:40:26,847
ls it an old feud?

283
00:40:27,685 --> 00:40:31,849
That's none of your business.

284
00:40:35,993 --> 00:40:37,517
May l ask you another
question then?

285
00:40:38,696 --> 00:40:41,665
You know we're criminals, too.

286
00:40:42,766 --> 00:40:46,361
Why did you choose us
to track down the bandit?

287
00:40:47,204 --> 00:40:51,106
Only because iron
shall deal with iron.

288
00:40:57,748 --> 00:40:58,680
That's 5,000 Rupees.

289
00:40:59,650 --> 00:41:01,914
You will get 5,000 more upon
your arrival in Ramgarh.

290
00:41:02,987 --> 00:41:04,955
The rest after you have
accomplished the mission.

291
00:41:10,294 --> 00:41:13,593
What do you suggest?

292
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:25,536
'' Heads'' - we go.

293
00:41:48,299 --> 00:41:49,857
Well, gentlemen?
Where will you go?

294
00:41:50,301 --> 00:41:53,168
Belapur, Rampur, Ramgarh...
where do you want to go?

295
00:41:55,072 --> 00:41:58,200
Have you never seen
a horse-cart before?

296
00:41:58,842 --> 00:42:00,275
This is a village, sir.

297
00:42:00,644 --> 00:42:04,102
You can't find cars here in
which you can speed away.

298
00:42:04,748 --> 00:42:06,375
Basanti's ''tonga'' is all
you will find around here.

299
00:42:06,951 --> 00:42:09,977
Now look; l'm not in the habit
of talking unnecessarily.

300
00:42:10,287 --> 00:42:11,584
- Say so, if you wish to go...
- Well, we do wish...

301
00:42:11,855 --> 00:42:16,952
lt's okay, if you don't wish to go!
You won't be my enemies!

302
00:42:17,361 --> 00:42:20,262
l thought you'd need a tonga
and happened to ask you.

303
00:42:20,531 --> 00:42:22,692
But you don't have to be
my passengers, you know.

304
00:42:23,067 --> 00:42:24,659
lt's your own free will!

305
00:42:25,169 --> 00:42:28,798
This is Basanti's tonga, not
the field of the landlord...

306
00:42:29,073 --> 00:42:30,802
...which you will have to till,
even if you don't want to!

307
00:42:31,108 --> 00:42:34,100
- This is just like...
- Let's go! We wish to go!

308
00:42:35,346 --> 00:42:37,576
- Let's go!
- Sure. When have l refused?

309
00:42:37,982 --> 00:42:40,849
Now look; l'm not a chatter-box.

310
00:42:41,452 --> 00:42:43,579
So l'd better tell you in advance.

311
00:42:44,021 --> 00:42:46,785
A ride to Belapur costs 2 Rupees
and one to Rampur costs 1 .5 Rupee.

312
00:42:47,124 --> 00:42:49,888
Don't haggle, please!
What Basanti says is final!

313
00:42:50,361 --> 00:42:52,420
- Okay, but we...
- l know what you will say!

314
00:42:52,730 --> 00:42:57,030
Just why l charge 2 Rupees for
Belapur and 1 .50 for Ramgarh?

315
00:42:57,501 --> 00:42:59,867
You'd better ask which village
this tonga belongs to. Go on.

316
00:43:00,471 --> 00:43:04,373
- Well, where does it belong?
- lt belongs to Ramgarh!

317
00:43:04,908 --> 00:43:08,105
l see! So it belongs
to Ramgarh! Now l know!

318
00:43:08,145 --> 00:43:10,636
Actually, there is this thing
worth considering.

319
00:43:10,881 --> 00:43:13,008
When l make a trip to Belapur,
l actually make two trips.

320
00:43:13,417 --> 00:43:15,180
To Belapur and back to Ramgarh.

321
00:43:15,653 --> 00:43:17,780
But should l go to Ramgarh,
it's like going home.

322
00:43:23,293 --> 00:43:25,090
Where would you like to go?

323
00:43:25,529 --> 00:43:28,123
Actually, we'd like
to go to Ramgarh, too.

324
00:43:28,332 --> 00:43:30,027
Sure! When have l refused?

325
00:43:30,601 --> 00:43:34,230
But you will have to tell me
whose house you're going to.

326
00:43:34,905 --> 00:43:36,566
So Basanti can take you
to that house.

327
00:43:37,107 --> 00:43:40,304
lf l'm not told where
you've got to go...

328
00:43:40,611 --> 00:43:41,737
...how will l stop the tonga?

329
00:43:42,312 --> 00:43:44,906
How will the tonga stop
if l don't stop it?

330
00:43:45,616 --> 00:43:50,383
Who holds the reins?
l do!

331
00:43:50,788 --> 00:43:52,380
And if l...

332
00:43:52,656 --> 00:43:54,283
We've got to go to Thakur
Baldev Singh's place.

333
00:43:56,627 --> 00:43:58,561
Sure! Let's go!
When did l refuse?

334
00:43:59,496 --> 00:44:00,758
You could said as much!

335
00:44:01,331 --> 00:44:02,559
Let's go, Dhanno!

336
00:44:11,542 --> 00:44:15,308
So you see, l had already
lost my parents.

337
00:44:16,180 --> 00:44:20,412
And who had to fend for my aunt
and ply the tonga?

338
00:44:20,684 --> 00:44:21,548
Me, of course.

339
00:44:22,219 --> 00:44:27,247
People ask how a girl like me
can go around plying a tonga.

340
00:44:27,725 --> 00:44:29,955
l have an answer ready
for them.

341
00:44:30,494 --> 00:44:33,361
Dhanno is a mare; and she
can still draw the cart.

342
00:44:33,697 --> 00:44:36,723
So why not Basanti?
Am l right?

343
00:44:36,900 --> 00:44:40,961
So what's wrong? City girls drive
cars... no one says anything to them.

344
00:44:42,005 --> 00:44:45,907
You're a wise man, although
you're from the city.

345
00:44:46,343 --> 00:44:48,607
- What is your name?
- Veeru.

346
00:44:49,747 --> 00:44:51,908
You haven't yet asked me
my name, have you?

347
00:44:52,349 --> 00:44:54,146
What is your name, Basanti?

348
00:44:54,618 --> 00:44:56,882
Oh, shut up! You're always
talking nonsense!

349
00:44:58,055 --> 00:45:00,421
l wasn't talking to you, you know.

350
00:45:00,758 --> 00:45:04,319
But since you have asked me,
let me tell you...

351
00:45:04,628 --> 00:45:05,788
...my name is Basanti.

352
00:45:06,163 --> 00:45:07,687
That's the first time
l've heard the name.

353
00:45:08,766 --> 00:45:11,530
Basanti! What a lovely name!

354
00:45:12,703 --> 00:45:16,070
There's a story
behind my name, too.

355
00:45:16,440 --> 00:45:17,600
Really? Do tell me... !

356
00:45:18,709 --> 00:45:21,507
When l was a little girl,...

357
00:45:21,945 --> 00:45:24,345
... a distant relative said...

358
00:45:41,565 --> 00:45:44,033
That's it, Dhanno! Halt!

359
00:45:45,169 --> 00:45:46,329
This is the Thakur's mansion.

360
00:45:47,237 --> 00:45:51,674
Strange! Talking to you guys,
l didn't even realize the distance.

361
00:45:52,142 --> 00:45:54,235
That's right.
We are very talkative.

362
00:45:54,578 --> 00:45:57,741
Here's the 1 .50 Rupee
we had settled for.

363
00:45:58,048 --> 00:46:00,107
You're a nice man. l shouldn't be
accepting the money from you.

364
00:46:00,651 --> 00:46:03,677
But what will the horse eat,
if it befriends its food?

365
00:46:04,288 --> 00:46:07,689
- So l will accept the money.
- That's very kind of you.

366
00:46:09,426 --> 00:46:12,020
Let's go, Dhanno!

367
00:46:19,837 --> 00:46:23,329
Wow! She talks so well!

368
00:46:24,341 --> 00:46:26,775
She talks too much!

369
00:46:27,110 --> 00:46:29,544
Let's go. You don't have to
score with every girl you meet.

370
00:46:32,115 --> 00:46:32,979
Come on!

371
00:46:34,318 --> 00:46:35,148
Welcome.

372
00:46:39,489 --> 00:46:40,751
This way, please.

373
00:46:45,696 --> 00:46:46,458
Greetings, Thakur.

374
00:46:47,364 --> 00:46:48,922
You had no problems
getting here, l hope?

375
00:46:49,800 --> 00:46:51,392
Well, not much.

376
00:46:52,369 --> 00:46:52,926
Come in.

377
00:46:56,373 --> 00:46:59,069
Had you dropped a letter, l'd have
sent someone to receive you.

378
00:47:00,544 --> 00:47:02,171
Your stay has been arranged.

379
00:47:03,614 --> 00:47:05,343
Just let me know, if there
is anything you need.

380
00:47:16,526 --> 00:47:19,654
l had promised to pay you 5000
rupees on your arrival here.

381
00:47:24,201 --> 00:47:27,227
You remember your
assignment, don't you?

382
00:47:28,505 --> 00:47:30,564
l want Gabbar.

383
00:47:31,174 --> 00:47:33,199
- l want him alive.
- Of course, remember.

384
00:47:33,710 --> 00:47:37,908
You want Gabbar...
captured alive.

385
00:47:38,882 --> 00:47:39,678
You will have him.

386
00:47:41,084 --> 00:47:43,450
Go and take some rest.
You must be tired.

387
00:47:44,421 --> 00:47:45,718
We'll discuss the rest later.

388
00:47:46,823 --> 00:47:47,414
Follow me.

389
00:48:00,938 --> 00:48:03,338
Please go ahead.
l'll go and fetch the keys.

390
00:48:10,547 --> 00:48:15,041
That safe was
stuffed with riches!

391
00:48:16,553 --> 00:48:19,044
Folks in this village
seem to wear a lot of gold.

392
00:48:19,589 --> 00:48:20,647
So what do you say?

393
00:48:44,314 --> 00:48:50,275
Quite a big house...
and beautiful, too.

394
00:48:51,688 --> 00:48:54,213
- Who else stays in there?
- Your keys.

395
00:48:56,626 --> 00:48:57,456
That is your quarters.

396
00:48:58,261 --> 00:49:00,161
Do call me over, should
you need something.

397
00:49:04,868 --> 00:49:08,895
l can't quite figure this out.

398
00:49:09,306 --> 00:49:12,798
Why must we bother, Jai?
The Thakur has paid us 1 0,000.

399
00:49:13,343 --> 00:49:17,439
Let's clean out his safe tonight
and get away. What say?

400
00:49:18,181 --> 00:49:19,648
Very well.

401
00:49:20,784 --> 00:49:22,649
Let's sleep now, if we're going
to keep awake tonight.

402
00:51:00,784 --> 00:51:02,752
Thakur! These guys were...

403
00:51:03,320 --> 00:51:04,218
They're my men.

404
00:51:05,622 --> 00:51:07,089
Then why did they attack us?

405
00:51:08,225 --> 00:51:13,094
l wanted to see if you still
possess the courage and strength.

406
00:51:13,530 --> 00:51:20,026
Or whether time has rendered
your might, impotent.

407
00:51:20,303 --> 00:51:22,328
So? What did you see?

408
00:51:23,673 --> 00:51:31,045
l see that l have made no mistake
in having you brought here.

409
00:51:35,785 --> 00:51:38,083
There is one mistake you
have made, Thakur!

410
00:51:38,788 --> 00:51:40,983
You have shown us the
contents of your safe.

411
00:53:04,441 --> 00:53:05,840
Here's the key to the safe.

412
00:53:07,177 --> 00:53:12,615
The safe has some ornaments
which are of no use to me.

413
00:53:13,717 --> 00:53:16,618
A widow will never need them again.

414
00:53:18,455 --> 00:53:22,016
lt has some money, too.
You can take that away.

415
00:53:23,927 --> 00:53:27,988
l'm glad, it will at least break
the Thakur's false hopes.

416
00:53:29,165 --> 00:53:31,224
Hopes, that he has pinned on you.

417
00:53:44,281 --> 00:53:45,646
Excuse me.

418
00:54:07,971 --> 00:54:11,168
That which happened last night
will not happen again.

419
00:54:30,894 --> 00:54:33,158
Here... have some more!

420
00:54:33,797 --> 00:54:35,662
You've eaten enough
to be big and strong!

421
00:54:36,032 --> 00:54:39,832
But when we make to trip to Belapur,
you sure do put on airs!

422
00:54:40,403 --> 00:54:43,804
- Go ahead and eat...!
- Basanti...!

423
00:54:44,207 --> 00:54:46,732
l'm here, feeding
this donkey, auntie!

424
00:54:47,577 --> 00:54:49,670
Now watch her take off!

425
00:54:50,447 --> 00:54:54,975
Listen, lady!
You can roam around all day!

426
00:54:55,285 --> 00:54:57,685
But you wouldn't do
a simple chore for me!

427
00:54:58,154 --> 00:55:00,179
There she is! Ranting as usual!

428
00:55:00,490 --> 00:55:02,981
You're always losing
your temper with me, auntie.

429
00:55:03,360 --> 00:55:05,521
Won't you give me a chance?
What had you asked me to do?

430
00:55:05,929 --> 00:55:07,590
You asked me to go to
the physician, didn't you?

431
00:55:07,897 --> 00:55:10,491
l did go to him to
fetch your medicines.

432
00:55:10,800 --> 00:55:11,960
But he wasn't there.

433
00:55:12,402 --> 00:55:14,962
He's supposed to be ill...

434
00:55:15,238 --> 00:55:17,103
...and has gone to the neighboring
village for treatment.

435
00:55:17,407 --> 00:55:20,968
l didn't mention the doctor and
you gave me a whole lecture!

436
00:55:21,678 --> 00:55:23,646
What else did you ask me to do?

437
00:55:23,980 --> 00:55:25,948
Didn't l ask you to fetch some
raw mangoes for the pickle?

438
00:55:26,182 --> 00:55:27,376
But you will never remember!

439
00:55:28,985 --> 00:55:32,512
Oh sure, you did tell me!
l'll go and fetch them right away!

440
00:55:35,792 --> 00:55:38,488
lmamsaheb! Do you want me
to reach you home?

441
00:55:39,195 --> 00:55:39,991
Who's that?

442
00:55:40,730 --> 00:55:43,790
Basanti! lt's you today.

443
00:55:44,734 --> 00:55:46,793
l've spent years in this village.

444
00:55:47,570 --> 00:55:49,037
You weren't even born then.

445
00:55:49,672 --> 00:55:53,073
But even before l can alight
the steps of the mosque...

446
00:55:53,476 --> 00:55:56,536
...there is someone
to reach me home.

447
00:55:57,046 --> 00:55:57,978
Why wouldn't anyone?

448
00:55:58,882 --> 00:56:01,350
There's not a soul in town
who does not respect you.

449
00:56:01,851 --> 00:56:04,513
When they respect you so much,
why won't they help you too?

450
00:56:04,954 --> 00:56:06,683
lt's all very natural.
Actually...

451
00:56:06,956 --> 00:56:10,983
When you can talk so much, why don't
you talk some sense to Ahmed too?

452
00:56:11,528 --> 00:56:13,359
He's even younger to you.

453
00:56:14,063 --> 00:56:17,032
l know how to make them
see sense, lmam.

454
00:56:17,567 --> 00:56:19,034
l can make your son
see reason too.

455
00:56:19,402 --> 00:56:25,705
But unless l know what l have
to talk about, how will l?

456
00:56:26,242 --> 00:56:30,440
Ahmed's uncle works for a beedi-
manufacturing factory in Jabalpur.

457
00:56:30,847 --> 00:56:32,940
- He earns 300 Rupees every month!
- Really?

458
00:56:33,716 --> 00:56:36,617
He has written to me so very often
to send Ahmed over...

459
00:56:36,920 --> 00:56:39,218
...so he'll talk to his boss and
find Ahmed a job in the same factory.

460
00:56:39,756 --> 00:56:42,122
But Ahmed is just not
prepared to go!

461
00:56:42,625 --> 00:56:44,786
He says l'd be left all alone!

462
00:56:45,528 --> 00:56:48,258
- Hi! How are you?
- l'm fine, all right.

463
00:56:48,665 --> 00:56:52,624
Now tell me; you've completed your
matriculation and speak English too.

464
00:56:53,102 --> 00:56:55,468
And as your uncle
in Jabalpur writes...

465
00:56:55,605 --> 00:56:58,039
There you are! You're taken up
with my father says, too!

466
00:56:58,508 --> 00:56:59,600
That's the only thing he says
to anyone who meets him.

467
00:57:00,210 --> 00:57:02,678
So what's wrong? l just answered
a question she asked.

468
00:57:03,012 --> 00:57:05,537
You know, l'm not used
to talking without reason.

469
00:57:06,149 --> 00:57:08,640
But just think it over!
lt's a beedi-manufacturing factory!

470
00:57:09,018 --> 00:57:13,682
Work while you work... and smoke
a beedi, when you feel like it!

471
00:57:13,890 --> 00:57:15,983
lt's like getting all the
mangoes for nothing...

472
00:57:16,359 --> 00:57:18,452
- My God!
- What's wrong?

473
00:57:19,062 --> 00:57:21,758
The mangoes! l forgot them again!

474
00:57:22,432 --> 00:57:23,524
- The raw-mangoes!
- The raw mangoes ?

475
00:57:23,967 --> 00:57:25,525
Yes. l had to fetch them
for the pickle...

476
00:57:48,391 --> 00:57:50,757
Well? What are you doing here?

477
00:57:51,494 --> 00:57:53,587
Well... ! That's how it is.

478
00:57:55,131 --> 00:57:56,860
Well... which mango do you
want me to knock off?

479
00:57:57,500 --> 00:57:59,730
Can you really shoot down
the mango l want?

480
00:58:00,103 --> 00:58:01,832
That's child's play!

481
00:58:02,305 --> 00:58:04,466
The best of the big shots pay
respects at my meet...

482
00:58:04,741 --> 00:58:07,733
...and swear they haven't seen
a marksman like me!

483
00:58:08,411 --> 00:58:09,935
You seem to be a damn good-shot!

484
00:58:10,280 --> 00:58:12,475
Sure... he's of royal
descent, isn't he?

485
00:58:13,483 --> 00:58:17,010
- What was that he said?
- Never mind. He talks nonsense.

486
00:58:17,554 --> 00:58:18,680
So, which mango do you want?

487
00:58:20,790 --> 00:58:25,090
That one there... the other one,
too. And yet another one there.

488
00:58:37,941 --> 00:58:39,875
My word! Your friend
is a great shot, too!

489
00:58:40,543 --> 00:58:42,135
Eh? Oh, yes. Bright chap, you know.

490
00:58:42,579 --> 00:58:44,206
l'm still teaching him...
He'll learn soon.

491
00:58:44,948 --> 00:58:48,213
- Can you teach me, too?
- Certainly! l can teach you, too!

492
00:58:48,651 --> 00:58:51,085
ln fact, l can teach you this
in a matter of two days.

493
00:58:51,854 --> 00:58:53,446
- ln just two days ?!
- Of course.

494
00:58:53,923 --> 00:58:56,255
There have been people he has
''taught'' in a couple of hours!

495
00:59:00,063 --> 00:59:02,861
- ln just a couple of hours!
- He talks nonsense, you know!

496
00:59:03,232 --> 00:59:05,700
Well, come with me, if you
wish to learn this.

497
00:59:07,203 --> 00:59:08,397
Can you see that mango there?

498
00:59:09,639 --> 00:59:10,936
- You can see it, can't you?
- Sure.

499
00:59:11,240 --> 00:59:13,208
Now hold the gun...

500
00:59:13,776 --> 00:59:18,543
...and bring this other hand...
close to the other.

501
00:59:18,915 --> 00:59:23,978
Now place this finger
on the trigger.

502
00:59:24,354 --> 00:59:26,720
Now close your eye and...

503
00:59:26,990 --> 00:59:28,958
l have already shut my eyes!

504
00:59:30,126 --> 00:59:31,593
What is he talking about?

505
00:59:32,161 --> 00:59:33,651
The usual nonsense!

506
00:59:34,864 --> 00:59:37,298
- Now close your eyes.
- Very well.

507
00:59:38,234 --> 00:59:41,101
You've shut your eyes, have you?
Now... can you see that mango?

508
00:59:42,472 --> 00:59:46,670
Strange! How can l see the mango,
when l've shut my eyes?

509
00:59:47,210 --> 00:59:48,905
- Have you shut both your eyes?!
- Yes.

510
00:59:49,512 --> 00:59:52,106
But you must shut only
your left eye... this one!

511
00:59:53,116 --> 00:59:55,346
Now use your other eye
to aim at the mango.

512
00:59:56,586 --> 00:59:59,350
- Okay. And what do l do now?
- Now? Well...

513
01:00:00,123 --> 01:00:00,817
Now squeeze the trigger!

514
01:00:06,162 --> 01:00:07,925
He's found his mark!

515
01:00:09,666 --> 01:00:13,158
l thought l was learning
to handle a gun.

516
01:00:13,803 --> 01:00:16,033
But now l smell a rat!

517
01:00:16,539 --> 01:00:20,270
A rat? What is that?
l don't understand!

518
01:00:20,710 --> 01:00:22,007
But l understand this
perfectly well!

519
01:00:22,712 --> 01:00:26,546
You city-guys think we in the
countryside are morons!

520
01:00:27,050 --> 01:00:33,580
But Basanti could very well
teach you a lesson!

521
01:00:33,956 --> 01:00:37,585
l was only teaching you!
You're misunderstanding me!

522
01:00:38,061 --> 01:00:39,153
l understand you very well!

523
01:00:40,296 --> 01:00:44,164
Sit here with your gun!
l'm going home!

524
01:00:44,734 --> 01:00:45,462
Good-bye!

525
01:03:31,400 --> 01:03:35,359
Kashiram ! Dholiya!
Where the hell are all of you?

526
01:03:41,744 --> 01:03:44,941
Come, Shankar...
what have you brought?

527
01:03:45,815 --> 01:03:48,215
lt's some jowar, sir.

528
01:03:48,618 --> 01:03:52,520
Bloody fiend! You give us
a handful of jowar?

529
01:03:53,623 --> 01:03:56,114
D'you want to feed the guests at your
daughter's wedding with the rest?

530
01:03:56,525 --> 01:03:59,085
l speak the truth, sir!
l've brought all l had!

531
01:03:59,629 --> 01:04:04,896
We need just one bullet
to blow your brains out!

532
01:04:05,601 --> 01:04:06,966
The stinking bastard!

533
01:04:10,606 --> 01:04:12,699
And what have you got, Dholiya?

534
01:04:13,542 --> 01:04:14,270
lt's wheat, sir.

535
01:04:14,911 --> 01:04:18,074
Very well. Keep all the stuff there.

536
01:04:19,215 --> 01:04:19,772
Hold it.

537
01:04:21,851 --> 01:04:23,284
Welcome, Thakur!

538
01:04:25,087 --> 01:04:26,577
You're still alive, are you?

539
01:04:27,523 --> 01:04:31,186
Yes. And till such time
as l live...

540
01:04:31,761 --> 01:04:35,697
...tell Gabbar you won't even
get a grain from this village.

541
01:04:37,099 --> 01:04:39,192
And who's going to stop us? You?

542
01:04:39,669 --> 01:04:44,868
Yes. My men and l will.

543
01:04:47,276 --> 01:04:48,208
These men?

544
01:04:49,679 --> 01:04:54,480
Heard that, guys? The Thakur has
built an army of eunuchs!

545
01:04:55,251 --> 01:04:57,947
Death hovers over
your head, Kalia!

546
01:04:59,121 --> 01:05:00,782
Just look around!

547
01:05:17,206 --> 01:05:19,504
Two of them? ls that all?

548
01:05:19,976 --> 01:05:21,409
That's enough for you.

549
01:05:22,945 --> 01:05:25,937
Kashiram... have all
the things taken back.

550
01:05:27,049 --> 01:05:28,710
Think it over, Thakur.

551
01:05:29,518 --> 01:05:31,042
When Gabbar gets to know...

552
01:05:31,520 --> 01:05:34,614
...that people of this village
refuse to give him foodgrains...

553
01:05:35,257 --> 01:05:37,521
...there can be a lot
of bloodshed.

554
01:05:38,260 --> 01:05:40,854
Why must you simply...

555
01:05:49,071 --> 01:05:50,003
Get lost!

556
01:05:50,840 --> 01:05:52,068
And tell Gabbar...

557
01:05:52,608 --> 01:05:57,375
...that the people of Ramgarh
have stopped feeding mad dogs!

558
01:05:59,181 --> 01:06:00,808
Go away!

559
01:06:01,484 --> 01:06:04,749
All right, Thakur!
l will go away!

560
01:06:55,671 --> 01:06:57,161
How many were they?

561
01:06:58,140 --> 01:07:00,199
There were two of them, chief.

562
01:07:08,684 --> 01:07:10,117
Two of them?

563
01:07:10,953 --> 01:07:12,853
Goddamned bastards!

564
01:07:17,526 --> 01:07:20,927
There were just two of them...
and there were three of you.

565
01:07:22,064 --> 01:07:24,589
You have still returned...

566
01:07:25,234 --> 01:07:29,796
...without anything.

567
01:07:32,475 --> 01:07:33,965
What did you expect?

568
01:07:35,377 --> 01:07:37,402
That l'd be delighted?!

569
01:07:38,614 --> 01:07:40,206
That l'd congratulate you?!

570
01:07:43,052 --> 01:07:44,383
Shame on you!

571
01:07:50,960 --> 01:07:52,257
Samba!

572
01:07:53,162 --> 01:07:55,630
What prize has the Government
placed on my head?

573
01:07:55,898 --> 01:07:58,696
Fifty thousand Rupees, no less.

574
01:07:59,034 --> 01:08:00,365
Did you hear him?

575
01:08:02,271 --> 01:08:04,466
Fifty grand!

576
01:08:05,407 --> 01:08:08,774
And that's only because...

577
01:08:09,044 --> 01:08:12,536
...when children as many as
50 miles away from here...

578
01:08:13,349 --> 01:08:16,477
...when the babies are hollering
away in the nights...

579
01:08:16,752 --> 01:08:21,121
...their mother ask them to go to
sleep, lest Gabbar Singh arrives!

580
01:08:22,658 --> 01:08:24,683
And these bastards!

581
01:08:25,528 --> 01:08:28,861
They've done my reputation to dust!

582
01:08:31,967 --> 01:08:35,869
You will be punished.
You certainly will!

583
01:08:43,879 --> 01:08:45,471
How many bullets does
this gun have?

584
01:08:46,015 --> 01:08:47,710
- How many bullets in this?
- There are six, chief.

585
01:08:48,684 --> 01:08:50,208
Six bullets.

586
01:08:54,423 --> 01:08:56,288
This gun has six bullets.

587
01:08:58,727 --> 01:09:03,323
Six bullets... for just 3 men.

588
01:09:04,033 --> 01:09:05,864
That's an injustice!

589
01:09:12,875 --> 01:09:16,436
lt's okay now... it certainly is.

590
01:09:18,647 --> 01:09:23,311
Three parts of this now hold
bullets; and three are empty.

591
01:09:24,653 --> 01:09:28,180
l'll just roll the
whole stuff over.

592
01:09:31,060 --> 01:09:34,393
l don't know now where the bullets
are, or where they are not.

593
01:09:35,464 --> 01:09:39,195
l know nothing!

594
01:09:42,805 --> 01:09:53,909
This gun now holds three lives
and three deaths.

595
01:09:55,417 --> 01:09:57,078
Let's see what they get.

596
01:10:05,127 --> 01:10:06,219
He's escaped!

597
01:10:24,647 --> 01:10:26,114
He's escaped, too!

598
01:10:35,691 --> 01:10:38,353
What's gonna happen
of you, Kaliya?

599
01:10:38,594 --> 01:10:42,655
Chief! l've always lived
on what l got from you!

600
01:10:44,099 --> 01:10:48,195
lt's time you stopped a bullet.

601
01:10:55,611 --> 01:10:56,339
This is amazing!

602
01:11:10,192 --> 01:11:11,625
All three have escaped!

603
01:11:12,561 --> 01:11:17,931
None of the bastards
stopped a bullet!

604
01:11:44,593 --> 01:11:45,855
All three have escaped!

605
01:12:24,633 --> 01:12:29,366
Death to the cowards!

606
01:21:53,535 --> 01:21:58,097
Well... so this is the
Thakur's soldier!

607
01:22:01,476 --> 01:22:06,470
Kaliya told us there
were two of them, Samba.

608
01:22:07,882 --> 01:22:09,577
Where is the other?

609
01:22:10,385 --> 01:22:12,945
Where are you, soldier?!

610
01:22:14,622 --> 01:22:18,114
Hey, soldier... where
is your partner?

611
01:22:18,994 --> 01:22:19,551
Speak up!

612
01:22:20,462 --> 01:22:22,726
Listen, you other soldier!

613
01:22:23,198 --> 01:22:26,292
Will you step out, or do
l gun down your friend here?

614
01:22:27,035 --> 01:22:28,195
Hold it!

615
01:22:31,473 --> 01:22:36,877
Welcome...! Welcome!

616
01:22:38,713 --> 01:22:40,840
We now have you in
our clutches!

617
01:22:43,284 --> 01:22:43,943
Welcome...

618
01:22:47,756 --> 01:22:49,314
Good-boy!

619
01:23:03,872 --> 01:23:09,936
Well, Thakur? You brought these guys
to protect Ramgarh, did you?

620
01:23:10,512 --> 01:23:12,878
To take on Gabbar, did you?

621
01:23:13,381 --> 01:23:14,678
Listen, you villagers!

622
01:23:15,784 --> 01:23:18,252
Take a look out here!

623
01:23:18,887 --> 01:23:22,152
These the guys who came here
to protect you from me!

624
01:23:23,558 --> 01:23:28,120
Have they lost your pluck?
All of it?!

625
01:23:32,200 --> 01:23:37,297
There's only one man who can
save you from Gabbar's wrath!

626
01:23:38,473 --> 01:23:40,031
And that's Gabbar himself!

627
01:23:41,743 --> 01:23:47,079
ln exchange for your security, if
we take some provisions from you...

628
01:23:47,482 --> 01:23:49,177
...that is no crime or injustice!

629
01:23:49,784 --> 01:23:53,618
No crime, l say!
lt's no injustice!

630
01:23:57,826 --> 01:24:02,490
That's it then! Should anyone
dare raise his head again...

631
01:24:02,764 --> 01:24:03,992
...l will...

632
01:24:10,672 --> 01:24:11,297
The heads!

633
01:24:12,674 --> 01:24:15,837
You think these guys are
accomplished fighters, don't you?

634
01:24:17,045 --> 01:24:18,876
These hired-gunmen will now...

635
01:24:19,447 --> 01:24:25,682
...place their heads on my feet
and beg for mercy!

636
01:24:27,489 --> 01:24:29,650
They will beg at my feet!

637
01:24:34,162 --> 01:24:37,859
You've heard me, haven't you?
You have?

638
01:24:40,502 --> 01:24:44,666
Those heads of yours...
at my feet!

639
01:24:46,574 --> 01:24:47,438
Come on.

640
01:24:48,943 --> 01:24:50,171
Move, l say!

641
01:25:23,611 --> 01:25:25,203
Hurry up, Dhanno!

642
01:27:15,657 --> 01:27:19,286
We can't wage this battle
for you anymore, Thakur!

643
01:27:20,528 --> 01:27:24,191
We held you in great respect.
But it's all over!

644
01:27:25,333 --> 01:27:27,927
We came here for
the brave inspector...

645
01:27:28,403 --> 01:27:31,998
...who waged a lone battle against
a gang of bandits in the train.

646
01:27:32,740 --> 01:27:34,367
We didn't come here
for a coward...

647
01:27:35,043 --> 01:27:38,410
...who couldn't pick up a gun lying
before him to save our lives!

648
01:27:40,915 --> 01:27:44,112
lt's okay, if you wish to leave.

649
01:27:45,019 --> 01:27:45,781
You can go.

650
01:27:46,821 --> 01:27:52,191
Before you leave, won't you
want to know the reason...

651
01:27:52,460 --> 01:27:55,293
...why l didn't pick up
this gun lying here?

652
01:27:55,596 --> 01:27:59,965
What reason can there be?
You're a coward!

653
01:28:02,603 --> 01:28:08,269
lt's a long story.

654
01:28:09,210 --> 01:28:12,976
lt happened during the days l was
posted at the Belapur police station.

655
01:28:13,715 --> 01:28:18,414
We got information that Gabbar was
going to loot the village Haripur.

656
01:28:19,153 --> 01:28:21,018
The police raided them
at the right time...

657
01:28:21,255 --> 01:28:22,722
...and the bandits had to flee.

658
01:28:23,624 --> 01:28:26,616
l started chasing Gabbar.

659
01:30:31,919 --> 01:30:35,650
Let me go... let go...
Leave me alone, you bastard!

660
01:30:36,157 --> 01:30:40,719
Gabbar Singh! This is no arm!
This is a noose!

661
01:30:42,964 --> 01:30:45,558
ln view of the testimonies
and the evidence at hand...

662
01:30:45,867 --> 01:30:47,494
...this Court reaches
the conclusion that...

663
01:30:47,935 --> 01:30:51,996
...Gabbar Singh is a dangerous
and professional criminal.

664
01:30:52,573 --> 01:30:55,406
This court, therefore, holding
him guilty of dacoity...

665
01:30:55,710 --> 01:31:01,342
...sentences him to 20 years
of rigorous imprisonment.

666
01:31:06,821 --> 01:31:11,724
l'll remember you...
l'm sure, l will remember you.

667
01:31:12,627 --> 01:31:16,723
After 20 years in the prison,
you will forget everything, Gabbar.

668
01:31:17,331 --> 01:31:20,357
No prison in the world
has walls strong enough...

669
01:31:20,768 --> 01:31:23,236
...to hold Gabbar captive
for 20 long years.

670
01:31:24,372 --> 01:31:30,538
And the day l escape,...
you will regret it, Thakur.

671
01:31:31,946 --> 01:31:33,277
You're going to regret it.

672
01:31:34,181 --> 01:31:34,647
Take him away.

673
01:31:35,850 --> 01:31:38,148
This enmity's going to
cost you dear, Thakur!

674
01:31:43,424 --> 01:31:45,892
Thakur! Congratulations!

675
01:31:46,561 --> 01:31:49,428
Another criminal you've nabbed
is coming to my prison.

676
01:31:51,632 --> 01:31:55,466
He's a dangerous man, jailer.
You'd better be careful.

677
01:31:56,804 --> 01:31:59,204
l'm glad your application
for leave has come through.

678
01:32:00,241 --> 01:32:03,301
lt had to anyway. You're going on
leave after a very long time.

679
01:32:03,578 --> 01:32:08,140
Had l not taken leave now, my folks
would have stopped talking to me.

680
01:32:09,083 --> 01:32:12,246
lt's the same story with
everyone in our profession.

681
01:32:12,587 --> 01:32:13,679
l face the same problem.

682
01:32:14,088 --> 01:32:15,578
How many members do
you have in your family?

683
01:32:16,090 --> 01:32:21,494
l have two sons who are married and
a daughter of marriageable age, too.

684
01:32:22,330 --> 01:32:24,298
l want to find a nice groom
for her this time.

685
01:32:25,399 --> 01:32:26,957
l also have a grandson.

686
01:32:27,468 --> 01:32:28,901
Really? You don't look so old!

687
01:32:29,770 --> 01:32:32,068
We in the village are
married very early in life.

688
01:32:32,840 --> 01:32:35,206
An early marriage means
the son comes early, too.

689
01:32:36,043 --> 01:32:38,534
Since the son marries early,
he has a son very soon.

690
01:32:39,213 --> 01:32:41,010
ln fact, he's about
8 years of age.

691
01:32:41,315 --> 01:32:43,943
Old enough to take offence if
you don't visit him on leave?

692
01:32:44,352 --> 01:32:45,649
You bet!

693
01:32:46,020 --> 01:32:49,217
l'm carrying gifts for everyone,
in order to pacify them.

694
01:32:50,191 --> 01:32:54,127
There you are then; l've never
accepted a bribe in my life.

695
01:32:54,428 --> 01:32:57,158
But l have to bribe my family,
whenever l go home!

696
01:32:58,399 --> 01:32:59,866
l must take your leave now.

697
01:33:04,338 --> 01:33:07,501
- What is it?
- Gabbar Singh has escaped, sir!

698
01:33:07,975 --> 01:33:09,374
Gabbar Singh has escaped?!

699
01:33:12,446 --> 01:33:13,572
You've missed again!

700
01:33:14,548 --> 01:33:16,175
You're no good, uncle!

701
01:33:16,450 --> 01:33:19,078
Oh sure! Your father's been hunting
lions, hasn't he? Just shut up!

702
01:33:19,487 --> 01:33:22,251
You're going to the station to
receive grandpa, aren't you?

703
01:33:22,857 --> 01:33:25,052
- May l come along, too?
- Go and ask your mother.

704
01:33:25,626 --> 01:33:26,456
Why don't you tell her?

705
01:33:27,294 --> 01:33:29,626
Just tell her that you're
going with me. Go on.

706
01:33:32,833 --> 01:33:33,424
Mother...

707
01:33:34,969 --> 01:33:36,937
Let me cut the vegetables.

708
01:33:37,638 --> 01:33:39,629
May l go to the station
with uncle, mother?

709
01:33:40,041 --> 01:33:41,303
No. You're not going
to the station.

710
01:33:41,976 --> 01:33:46,310
Madam... l've asked someone
to fix the main-gate.

711
01:33:47,448 --> 01:33:53,444
And here are the things
you had asked for...

712
01:33:55,356 --> 01:33:58,689
- Young mistress!
- l'm coming over!

713
01:34:06,767 --> 01:34:10,703
l'm going to the temple. But if
there is anything l can do...?

714
01:34:11,205 --> 01:34:12,900
Go on. l'll handle it.

715
01:34:13,441 --> 01:34:15,102
- Let's go.
- Give me that.

716
01:34:19,180 --> 01:34:22,274
- May l go to the station, mom?
- Haven't l said you can't?

717
01:34:22,950 --> 01:34:25,214
Let him go, if he wants to.

718
01:34:25,686 --> 01:34:28,086
No way. There are always so many
trains passing by.

719
01:34:28,355 --> 01:34:29,014
l'm scared.

720
01:34:29,457 --> 01:34:32,483
The trains seem to have an axe
to grind against your son.

721
01:34:33,160 --> 01:34:36,186
They'll leave their tracks
to go after him!

722
01:34:36,864 --> 01:34:39,389
You have a funny logic.

723
01:34:40,601 --> 01:34:42,660
So you're preparing the
vegetable father likes, eh?

724
01:34:43,671 --> 01:34:46,196
- Let him go, l say.
- Okay! Go ahead and spoil him!

725
01:34:47,842 --> 01:34:50,367
Will you go like this?
Go and have a bath.

726
01:34:50,811 --> 01:34:52,972
Ask your aunt to...
Nirmala!

727
01:34:53,848 --> 01:34:54,872
Yes, sister-in-law?

728
01:34:55,116 --> 01:34:56,743
Will you get a set of clothes
out for the kid, my girl?

729
01:34:57,284 --> 01:34:58,251
Right away.

730
01:34:59,253 --> 01:34:59,810
Go on.

731
01:35:00,688 --> 01:35:02,315
And you've started chewing
on the raw vegetables!

732
01:35:04,525 --> 01:35:07,494
They're all busy today
to impress father!

733
01:35:07,862 --> 01:35:10,296
As if you get the witch to
do the chores every day!

734
01:35:11,899 --> 01:35:13,958
This wheel is still lying here?

735
01:35:15,402 --> 01:35:18,530
Ramlal has become
a forgetful old man.

736
01:35:19,406 --> 01:35:24,571
l'd asked him to have the drawing
room and father's room cleaned.

737
01:35:24,812 --> 01:35:26,109
But he's not even to be seen.

738
01:35:26,647 --> 01:35:30,447
He's away at the temple with Radha.
He will do it when he returns.

739
01:35:31,585 --> 01:35:33,678
- Hey, Ninni!
- Yes, brother?

740
01:35:34,155 --> 01:35:37,647
Have a bath and get ready!
Aren't we going to the station?

741
01:35:38,259 --> 01:35:40,693
l'll join you in a minute!

742
01:35:42,563 --> 01:35:47,466
l can't figure out how this silly
hunter found a wife like Radha.

743
01:35:48,502 --> 01:35:50,834
lt was l who asked father
to pursue the alliance.

744
01:35:51,305 --> 01:35:53,000
But does anyone even
acknowledge what l've done?

745
01:35:54,041 --> 01:35:56,635
l've found him a wife
who's one in a million!

746
01:35:56,911 --> 01:36:00,438
Or girls nowadays ask for a division
the day they are married.

747
01:36:01,115 --> 01:36:03,811
Wait and see what a great match
l find for Nimmo next.

748
01:36:13,327 --> 01:36:14,453
No!

749
01:40:37,976 --> 01:40:39,068
Gabbar?

750
01:40:43,548 --> 01:40:44,412
Yes...

751
01:42:44,569 --> 01:42:45,968
Welcome, Thakur.

752
01:42:47,906 --> 01:42:50,500
l knew for sure
that you'd come here.

753
01:42:55,881 --> 01:42:58,941
The ass struggles!

754
01:42:59,351 --> 01:43:01,478
You contemptible bastard!
God-damn scoundrel!

755
01:43:03,588 --> 01:43:07,388
Curse me as much as you wish!
To your heart's content!

756
01:43:07,793 --> 01:43:11,092
- You bastard!
- Yes! Shout some more!

757
01:43:12,030 --> 01:43:15,989
Remember? l cried the other day
and you watched the fun?

758
01:43:17,369 --> 01:43:20,827
You will cry your lungs out today...
and l will watch the fun!

759
01:43:21,606 --> 01:43:22,368
Know what, Samba?

760
01:43:24,042 --> 01:43:28,877
l was livid at the court that
day... so very furious!

761
01:43:29,614 --> 01:43:32,811
l could have wrung his neck
there and then! The bastard!

762
01:43:33,518 --> 01:43:37,181
But l couldn't help it!
l was held by four of those cops!

763
01:43:37,856 --> 01:43:40,188
Handcuffs in my hands...
my legs shackled! Remember?

764
01:43:42,594 --> 01:43:44,459
You remember that, don't you?

765
01:43:48,767 --> 01:43:51,031
Any last wish, Thakur?

766
01:43:58,410 --> 01:44:01,402
There's still a lot
of life in your arms.

767
01:44:02,881 --> 01:44:04,041
Tie him up!

768
01:44:18,396 --> 01:44:20,591
l'm not going to kill you now.

769
01:44:22,167 --> 01:44:27,764
After l'm through with you...
the world will spit on you.

770
01:44:29,241 --> 01:44:31,175
Your arms are full of life!

771
01:44:32,677 --> 01:44:36,374
His arms are strong enough
to pull down a running horse!

772
01:44:39,251 --> 01:44:41,913
Your arms are full of life!

773
01:44:43,321 --> 01:44:45,448
D'you remember what you
had once told me?

774
01:44:46,191 --> 01:44:49,024
They aren't arms...
they're a noose!

775
01:44:50,228 --> 01:44:54,255
And here you are!
The noose has been destroyed!

776
01:44:54,833 --> 01:44:56,323
lt has been ripped open!

777
01:44:57,536 --> 01:44:59,367
Arms full of life, aren't they?

778
01:45:01,973 --> 01:45:03,497
These arms...

779
01:45:04,442 --> 01:45:06,103
- ...give them to me, Thakur.
- No!

780
01:45:07,546 --> 01:45:13,143
- Give me your arms, Thakur!
- No!

781
01:46:35,967 --> 01:46:37,958
- Did you see anything else?
- No, sir.

782
01:46:38,570 --> 01:46:41,232
We shut our doors and windows
when we heard the gunfire.

783
01:46:42,073 --> 01:46:43,802
l see... very well.

784
01:46:45,477 --> 01:46:47,672
- Put your thumb-impression here.
- Very well, sir.

785
01:46:50,315 --> 01:46:51,213
Welcome, Thakur.

786
01:46:54,586 --> 01:46:58,386
l've got to know of what happened
here, from these folks.

787
01:46:58,790 --> 01:46:59,848
l wanted to discuss
something with you.

788
01:47:00,625 --> 01:47:04,186
The police want Gabbar;
dead or alive.

789
01:47:05,930 --> 01:47:09,229
You will have him one day.

790
01:47:10,602 --> 01:47:12,126
ls there something you can
tell me about Gabbar?

791
01:47:13,471 --> 01:47:14,631
No.

792
01:47:15,740 --> 01:47:18,538
Okay. That's all l wanted to know.

793
01:47:19,444 --> 01:47:20,570
Thank you, Thakur.

794
01:47:25,350 --> 01:47:26,180
Good-bye.

795
01:47:40,331 --> 01:47:45,997
We don't want that money, Thakur.

796
01:47:46,871 --> 01:47:47,769
Please take it back.

797
01:47:49,574 --> 01:47:52,168
Please don't think, we won't carry
out the mission for you.

798
01:47:53,611 --> 01:48:00,244
But didn't you say
you only work for money?

799
01:48:00,819 --> 01:48:04,220
Well, we...

800
01:48:04,456 --> 01:48:05,548
We will get the money anyway.

801
01:48:07,726 --> 01:48:10,126
- Once we have killed Gabbar...
- You will not kill Gabbar!

802
01:48:13,131 --> 01:48:18,535
You are here to catch Gabbar alive
and hand him over to me.

803
01:48:19,404 --> 01:48:23,033
Give me your word! That you will
hand him over to me, alive!

804
01:48:28,613 --> 01:48:35,917
We give you our word, Thakur.
But please take back the money.

805
01:48:37,422 --> 01:48:41,358
Girija, the blacksmith, brings
some news from village Titli.

806
01:48:45,330 --> 01:48:48,788
You might meet Gabbar
again very soon.

807
01:48:50,468 --> 01:48:51,025
Come on.

808
01:48:55,106 --> 01:48:57,540
- Greetings, Thakur.
- Greetings.

809
01:48:58,376 --> 01:49:00,139
So what's news, Girija?

810
01:49:00,712 --> 01:49:03,545
There are some gypsies
staying at Pipri.

811
01:49:03,915 --> 01:49:05,212
Hira and his friends
are there too.

812
01:49:07,852 --> 01:49:10,582
Hira is the one who sells
arms and ammunition to Gabbar.

813
01:49:11,623 --> 01:49:14,717
Gabbar is bound to meet him
in a couple of days.

814
01:49:16,027 --> 01:49:20,657
Strike... when the iron is hot.

815
01:54:13,458 --> 01:54:17,417
My God! What happened to him?

816
01:54:18,529 --> 01:54:21,930
Don't worry. The bullet has
just grazed his arm.

817
01:54:22,567 --> 01:54:23,693
lt's not a serious injury.

818
01:54:26,170 --> 01:54:28,900
We blew up almost all their
arms and explosives, Thakur...

819
01:54:29,140 --> 01:54:30,630
...but Gabbar managed to escape.

820
01:54:31,809 --> 01:54:34,539
lt's okay. We'll get him
again someday.

821
01:54:39,750 --> 01:54:43,516
Take a swig, partner.
Your troubles will vanish.

822
01:54:44,956 --> 01:54:48,153
Should you stop drinking, it will
reduce most of your troubles.

823
01:54:49,861 --> 01:54:51,419
- Would you like to...?
- God almighty!

824
01:55:15,920 --> 01:55:19,151
Greetings, lmam.
l have a letter for you.

825
01:55:19,624 --> 01:55:22,559
- Here you are.
- lt must be from Jabalpur.

826
01:55:23,361 --> 01:55:26,057
- Could you read it for me?
- Certainly.

827
01:55:27,498 --> 01:55:30,763
Where are my glasses?
l put it in my pocket!

828
01:55:31,135 --> 01:55:34,332
That which you are looking for
is here with me!

829
01:55:35,206 --> 01:55:37,231
- Here you are!
- The chatterbox is here, isn't she?

830
01:55:37,675 --> 01:55:41,406
Actually, we were going in
the opposite directions.

831
01:55:41,913 --> 01:55:44,108
You were on your bicycle
and l was on foot.

832
01:55:44,448 --> 01:55:47,474
You dropped your glasses
and l picked them up!

833
01:55:47,919 --> 01:55:50,581
l guessed as much that the
glasses must belong to you.

834
01:55:51,088 --> 01:55:54,888
The funny part is, it's
really yours. Actually...

835
01:55:55,226 --> 01:55:57,524
lf you rest your mouth a little,
l'd know what the letter says.

836
01:55:58,129 --> 01:56:00,723
- l'll listen to you later.
- Okay! When did l refuse?

837
01:56:01,499 --> 01:56:07,131
- lt begins with a greeting.
- Greetings himself, too.

838
01:56:07,438 --> 01:56:12,637
Everything is fine here and we
pray for your well-being.

839
01:56:13,477 --> 01:56:17,140
''The good news is that the job
for Ahmed has been finalized''

840
01:56:18,115 --> 01:56:19,776
'' He will get a salary
of 200 Rupees''

841
01:56:20,585 --> 01:56:23,383
'' He can very well stay with me
and eat with us, too''

842
01:56:24,155 --> 01:56:26,646
lt's good that he will
be in his uncle's care.

843
01:56:27,124 --> 01:56:29,524
Oh yes! That's wonderful!
That's just what l wanted, too.

844
01:56:29,927 --> 01:56:32,395
'' lt wouldn't be proper to delay
this matter anymore''

845
01:56:32,830 --> 01:56:35,628
'' l hope you will treat this
letter like a telegram''

846
01:56:36,367 --> 01:56:39,393
'' Please arrange to send
Ahmed here at the earliest''

847
01:56:40,004 --> 01:56:42,996
'' Everything else is fine here;
my folks send you their regards''

848
01:56:43,541 --> 01:56:47,671
- '' l remain, yours...
- Mukait Ul-lah.

849
01:56:48,145 --> 01:56:49,578
l will not listen to any
excuse from Ahmed now.

850
01:56:50,581 --> 01:56:54,039
That's right.
But he's very much here.

851
01:56:54,919 --> 01:56:57,217
Let me tell you, father.
l'm not going there.

852
01:56:57,888 --> 01:57:01,415
- This is like...
- This boy is a fool!

853
01:57:02,693 --> 01:57:07,221
l have one foot in the grave and you
have your life ahead of you!

854
01:57:07,598 --> 01:57:13,002
How long will you cling to me?
You don't find such jobs everyday.

855
01:57:13,404 --> 01:57:14,871
Your father is right, son.

856
01:57:15,473 --> 01:57:22,641
ln fact, l've heard of people
praying at temples in the cities...

857
01:57:23,614 --> 01:57:25,912
- The temple?!
- What's wrong?

858
01:57:27,351 --> 01:57:32,550
Actually, l was headed for the temple
and happened to find his glasses.

859
01:57:32,857 --> 01:57:35,724
That's it! l forgot
where l was going!

860
01:57:36,060 --> 01:57:38,927
But l've remembered it now!

861
01:57:41,532 --> 01:57:45,593
Hey, Veeru... there goes
your horse-cart girl.

862
01:57:51,108 --> 01:57:54,134
Well, Basanti...
you're on foot today.

863
01:57:54,979 --> 01:57:57,413
Has your mare run away
with the cart?

864
01:57:58,115 --> 01:58:04,520
You still don't understand
that no one elopes out here.

865
01:58:04,955 --> 01:58:07,014
My mare is honorably at home
and today being a Monday...

866
01:58:07,291 --> 01:58:13,389
...aunt told me that if l pray
to Lord Shiva on every Monday...

867
01:58:13,698 --> 01:58:16,428
...l'll get a husband that
the world will be stunned.

868
01:58:16,701 --> 01:58:21,035
l said, okay... l don't intend
to marry a bum anyway.

869
01:58:21,372 --> 01:58:23,135
Okay, then... l must leave.
Praise the Lord!

870
01:58:29,613 --> 01:58:30,409
Praise the Lord!

871
01:58:36,554 --> 01:58:37,111
Praise the Lord!

872
01:58:56,374 --> 01:59:00,708
Lord! There is nothing in the
world that is hidden from You.

873
01:59:01,178 --> 01:59:02,406
You are omniscient, Lord!

874
01:59:03,547 --> 01:59:05,674
l don't say that You have
forgotten it.

875
01:59:06,350 --> 01:59:08,375
But it's always good
to remind You.

876
01:59:09,019 --> 01:59:12,182
Today's a Monday and l have
a small request, Lord.

877
01:59:13,057 --> 01:59:19,223
Look at my hands, rough and rugged
from holding the reins!

878
01:59:19,864 --> 01:59:21,832
And what problems
could You have, Lord?

879
01:59:22,333 --> 01:59:26,599
Get me married into a family where
l will rule like the Queens!

880
01:59:27,071 --> 01:59:29,039
Life's gotta be fun!

881
01:59:30,341 --> 01:59:33,435
l leave the rest to You.

882
01:59:35,012 --> 01:59:37,503
Young lady...

883
01:59:37,848 --> 01:59:39,440
Who spoke?

884
01:59:40,751 --> 01:59:42,878
lt is l who has spoken!

885
01:59:44,155 --> 01:59:47,784
Lord! lt's You !
This is a miracle!

886
01:59:50,694 --> 01:59:56,394
l have found a match
for you, lady.

887
01:59:57,201 --> 01:59:59,635
ln just one Monday?
That's excellent!

888
02:00:00,171 --> 02:00:02,230
You must obviously have
chosen the best!

889
02:00:02,940 --> 02:00:06,671
Could You tell me the name, perhaps?
Or do l come again next week?

890
02:00:07,278 --> 02:00:08,404
l will do as You say, Lord.

891
02:00:08,579 --> 02:00:11,173
His name is Veeru.

892
02:00:11,882 --> 02:00:17,218
Veeru?! This has to do with my life!
Please don't make haste, Lord!

893
02:00:17,755 --> 02:00:19,279
l wouldn't mind You taking
a few Mondays more.

894
02:00:20,324 --> 02:00:23,782
He's okay to look at;
but he's a bloody smart ass!

895
02:00:24,495 --> 02:00:26,190
Silence, maiden!

896
02:00:26,630 --> 02:00:30,396
l never talk without reason, Lord!
l'll do as You say!

897
02:00:31,469 --> 02:00:38,432
lf you don't obey my command, you
will remain a spinster all your life!

898
02:00:38,709 --> 02:00:40,404
Forgive me, Lord!

899
02:00:40,778 --> 02:00:46,239
You will continue to drive the
horse-cart all your life!

900
02:00:47,084 --> 02:00:54,149
l now command you to go and tell
your aunt, in no uncertain terms...

901
02:00:54,792 --> 02:00:59,354
...that it is Veeru who will be
your companion for life!

902
02:01:00,564 --> 02:01:05,695
To respect and honor Veeru therefore
shall be your prime duty!

903
02:01:06,837 --> 02:01:11,638
Because, your heavens
lie at his feet!

904
02:01:12,576 --> 02:01:17,275
Should you please him,
l shall be pleased!

905
02:01:18,215 --> 02:01:23,517
And if you irritate him,
l shall be enraged!

906
02:01:24,388 --> 02:01:25,514
Really?

907
02:01:26,690 --> 02:01:28,248
So go to him...

908
02:01:43,674 --> 02:01:46,199
l thought l would...

909
02:01:47,411 --> 02:01:51,370
You thought this village belle
has no brains!

910
02:01:51,882 --> 02:01:53,247
You thought you could fool me!

911
02:01:53,784 --> 02:01:55,046
You think you're smart!

912
02:01:55,653 --> 02:01:58,451
But l could outsmart guys
like you!

913
02:01:58,956 --> 02:02:01,516
Sit here and play God!
l'm going home!

914
02:02:03,561 --> 02:02:06,029
At least listen to me!

915
02:06:17,581 --> 02:06:19,879
l've thought of
something today.

916
02:06:20,918 --> 02:06:22,783
You must do that,
once in a while.

917
02:06:23,787 --> 02:06:26,051
l've taken a very
crucial decision today.

918
02:06:26,957 --> 02:06:31,917
l know what your decision is;
you want to marry Basanti.

919
02:06:32,429 --> 02:06:35,193
That's wonderful!
You're a true friend!

920
02:06:35,699 --> 02:06:37,360
Only a friend could
know how l feel!

921
02:06:37,835 --> 02:06:43,296
But l also know that this is your
8th decision to marry this year.

922
02:06:43,874 --> 02:06:44,932
But this is final!

923
02:06:45,609 --> 02:06:49,010
Really? No wonder... you've been
drinking from early this morning.

924
02:06:50,948 --> 02:06:53,712
- Will you do something for me?
- What is it?

925
02:06:54,251 --> 02:06:58,813
Go and talk to Basanti's aunt;
make such an impression...

926
02:06:59,156 --> 02:07:00,919
...that the old lady is compelled
to propose our marriage!

927
02:07:01,358 --> 02:07:01,949
Why must l do that?

928
02:07:02,426 --> 02:07:05,224
Naturally! lt's the groom's folks
who approach the bride's parents!

929
02:07:05,629 --> 02:07:09,895
Besides, you're the only one
l have in the world, my friend!

930
02:07:10,300 --> 02:07:12,359
lt's your wedding, okay?
So go and do this yourself.

931
02:07:13,337 --> 02:07:17,330
Give it a thought...
a cozy home, after marriage!

932
02:07:17,774 --> 02:07:19,799
- A home that is yours.
- A loving wife...

933
02:07:20,110 --> 02:07:22,010
- Your wife.
- A handful of kids...

934
02:07:22,279 --> 02:07:25,248
- All yours, too.
- You're the one they'll call uncle!

935
02:07:25,949 --> 02:07:28,850
They'll forever pester you,
play with you all the time...

936
02:07:29,152 --> 02:07:33,589
...and ask you
to tell them a story!

937
02:07:35,592 --> 02:07:40,188
Which means l'm going to play
the maid-servant in your house.

938
02:07:42,032 --> 02:07:44,557
lt's clear now!
You are no friend!

939
02:07:45,769 --> 02:07:47,202
To hell with such a...

940
02:07:52,442 --> 02:07:57,243
Acting pricey, aren't you? Because
no one else can do this for me?

941
02:07:59,383 --> 02:08:02,716
Had only my mom been alive,
l'd have settled down in life!

942
02:08:02,986 --> 02:08:04,317
l'd even have had kids!

943
02:08:05,322 --> 02:08:08,849
Had my old man been around, he'd
have celebrated my wedding in style!

944
02:08:09,726 --> 02:08:13,560
Had l brothers and sisters, they'd
have begged the old lady...

945
02:08:13,931 --> 02:08:15,398
...but seen to it that
l married Basanti.

946
02:08:15,899 --> 02:08:20,063
But don't you forget! Those without
support, have God on their side!

947
02:08:20,971 --> 02:08:22,404
Lord Almighty!

948
02:08:24,041 --> 02:08:26,908
You're not the friend l knew!

949
02:08:27,144 --> 02:08:29,135
You don't want me to give up crime
and settle down in life!

950
02:08:30,180 --> 02:08:36,050
What had l imagined you to be...
and what you really are!

951
02:08:40,757 --> 02:08:46,389
The bloody clown...
he's forever up to dramatics!

952
02:08:47,297 --> 02:08:50,357
Cut the act! l'll go and talk
it over with the old lady.

953
02:08:51,401 --> 02:08:52,834
Will you, really?!

954
02:08:53,136 --> 02:08:59,371
An unmarried girl at home is
like a burden on the soul, son.

955
02:08:59,776 --> 02:09:03,075
l can be at peace, only when
Basanti is married.

956
02:09:04,214 --> 02:09:08,378
You're right. You are indeed
bearing a burden.

957
02:09:09,086 --> 02:09:12,419
But l can't just dump her
in a well, can l?

958
02:09:12,956 --> 02:09:16,483
Please don't mind this,
but l must ask...

959
02:09:16,960 --> 02:09:22,227
...about the suitor's family,
his habits and his earnings.

960
02:09:23,433 --> 02:09:29,065
As far as earnings go,
once he is married,

961
02:09:29,506 --> 02:09:31,497
...he will start earning
to fend for them.

962
02:09:32,843 --> 02:09:36,142
Doesn't he earning anything
at the moment, then?

963
02:09:36,546 --> 02:09:39,709
Of course, he does!
When did l say that he doesn't?

964
02:09:40,017 --> 02:09:42,850
lt's like this; no one can
win all the time, can he?

965
02:09:43,353 --> 02:09:46,288
There are times the poor chap
even loses money.

966
02:09:46,556 --> 02:09:47,784
- Loses money?
- That's right...

967
02:09:48,158 --> 02:09:51,616
...but that's gambling, you know.
There's little l can say about it.

968
02:09:52,262 --> 02:09:54,457
My God! ls he a gambler?

969
02:09:54,865 --> 02:09:59,461
Not at all, madam!
lt's a shame to call him a gambler!

970
02:09:59,736 --> 02:10:02,261
He's a gem of a person;
decent and straight.

971
02:10:02,539 --> 02:10:07,772
But when someone is high on liquor,
he can't see things in perspective.

972
02:10:08,211 --> 02:10:12,113
They force him into gambling.
How's poor Veeru to blame?

973
02:10:12,949 --> 02:10:19,286
You're right, son. A drinker and
a gambler... and yet, faultless!

974
02:10:19,556 --> 02:10:25,495
You're misunderstanding my friend.
He's an innocent, young chap.

975
02:10:25,962 --> 02:10:28,658
Just get him married to Basanti...

976
02:10:29,099 --> 02:10:31,897
...he'll give up drinking
and gambling in no time!

977
02:10:32,369 --> 02:10:34,997
Don't tell me, son.
l know better.

978
02:10:35,372 --> 02:10:38,341
Has anyone ever been able to kick
habits like drinking and gambling?

979
02:10:39,109 --> 02:10:43,136
You don't know Veeru. Believe me,
he's not at all like that.

980
02:10:43,647 --> 02:10:47,481
Once he's married, he'll stop
visiting the nautch girl. Period!

981
02:10:47,884 --> 02:10:49,784
His drinking problem will be
solved on its own!

982
02:10:50,053 --> 02:10:54,513
Good Lord! That's all he lacked!
He even visits brothels, does he?

983
02:10:54,791 --> 02:10:56,349
So what's wrong with that?

984
02:10:56,993 --> 02:11:01,453
Even kings and princes have
often patronized dancing-girls!

985
02:11:02,165 --> 02:11:07,865
l see... but can you tell me which
family your friend hails from?

986
02:11:08,338 --> 02:11:10,898
We'll let you know that,
the moment we get to know of it!

987
02:11:12,008 --> 02:11:18,038
l must say one thing, son.
For all your friend's vices...

988
02:11:18,582 --> 02:11:22,211
...you can only praise him!

989
02:11:22,819 --> 02:11:25,788
l can't help it, aunt.
l'm really soft at heart.

990
02:11:26,556 --> 02:11:32,085
So, do l take it then that
they will soon be married?

991
02:11:32,329 --> 02:11:35,127
Married? lt's okay even if she
remains a spinster all her life!

992
02:11:35,332 --> 02:11:36,594
But l will not let Basanti
marry such a man!

993
02:11:36,933 --> 02:11:38,798
l'm her aunt; not her step-mother!

994
02:11:41,104 --> 02:11:45,939
lt's strange that you refuse,
despite the best of my efforts.

995
02:11:47,444 --> 02:11:53,076
Poor Veeru. l don't know
how he will deal with this.

996
02:11:53,783 --> 02:11:57,651
l'll take a jump and die!
Out of my way!

997
02:11:58,021 --> 02:12:01,013
Hey, watch it!
What are you doing?

998
02:12:01,958 --> 02:12:06,122
l'm doing just what every
legendary lover has done!

999
02:12:06,530 --> 02:12:09,761
They died for their beloved's!

1000
02:12:11,168 --> 02:12:15,605
Suicide!

1001
02:12:18,241 --> 02:12:21,108
Well now... what is suicide?

1002
02:12:21,611 --> 02:12:24,239
When the English die,
they call it suicide.

1003
02:12:25,348 --> 02:12:27,680
But why do the English die?

1004
02:12:28,385 --> 02:12:33,345
What's up, feller? Why do you
want to commit suicide?

1005
02:12:33,690 --> 02:12:38,184
You'd rather not ask!
You'll break into tears!

1006
02:12:38,795 --> 02:12:41,355
lt's a very sad story!

1007
02:12:41,998 --> 02:12:46,401
lt has emotions, drama
and tragedy!

1008
02:12:47,170 --> 02:12:51,971
You know Basanti, don't you?
l was going to marry her.

1009
02:12:52,542 --> 02:12:57,775
But her wicked aunt has
been an obstacle!

1010
02:12:58,548 --> 02:13:01,711
l can't live in this big,
bad world, anymore!

1011
02:13:02,219 --> 02:13:06,246
l bid you farewell, villagers!
Good-bye!

1012
02:13:11,962 --> 02:13:14,089
Well, ... what is ''good-bye'' ?

1013
02:13:14,664 --> 02:13:16,825
When the English leave,
it's called ''good-bye'' .

1014
02:13:17,434 --> 02:13:19,834
But where do the English go?

1015
02:13:20,370 --> 02:13:23,635
Hey, villagers! Here l go!

1016
02:13:24,341 --> 02:13:26,434
God Almighty! Here l come!

1017
02:13:26,977 --> 02:13:29,172
Hold it! Wait...!

1018
02:13:30,380 --> 02:13:36,080
What?!... Okay, if you insist,
l'll wait for a while.

1019
02:13:36,519 --> 02:13:40,956
Hey... you're a strange friend!
You're sitting here unaffected!

1020
02:13:41,224 --> 02:13:42,816
- Why? What's wrong?
- How am l to know?

1021
02:13:43,226 --> 02:13:45,160
Look at your friend!
He's climbed all the way up there!

1022
02:13:47,897 --> 02:13:49,194
You see that, don't you?!

1023
02:13:51,768 --> 02:13:53,998
Yes, l do.
But nothing's going to happen.

1024
02:13:54,537 --> 02:13:56,732
He'll climb down,
when he sobers down.

1025
02:13:57,907 --> 02:14:01,809
l've seen many cruel people.
But not a heartless friend like you!

1026
02:14:02,579 --> 02:14:04,103
Hey, watch out!

1027
02:14:04,547 --> 02:14:09,416
l have no one in the world!
Nor friend, nor buddy...

1028
02:14:09,953 --> 02:14:12,217
So l'm going to end my life!

1029
02:14:12,989 --> 02:14:15,787
But l must warn you, villagers!

1030
02:14:16,526 --> 02:14:23,295
Where a lover ends his life, the
village is wrought with calamities!

1031
02:14:23,500 --> 02:14:25,263
What calamities will
we have to face?

1032
02:14:25,568 --> 02:14:32,633
There will be famine and drought!
Diseases and death!

1033
02:14:33,009 --> 02:14:37,810
And all that only for the sake of
that old hag! That old hag indeed!

1034
02:14:38,081 --> 02:14:38,638
My God!

1035
02:14:39,182 --> 02:14:43,949
You will see for yourselves!
When l die...

1036
02:14:44,487 --> 02:14:50,323
...the police will arrive and take
the old hag away to jail!

1037
02:14:51,127 --> 02:14:58,659
ln jail, the old hag will
labor on the grindstone...!

1038
02:14:59,803 --> 02:15:02,363
You'd better agree, lady.
Or he'll kill himself!

1039
02:15:02,839 --> 02:15:05,205
But how can l agree, Dinanath?!

1040
02:15:05,809 --> 02:15:11,441
You don't have to beg for anything
from the hag, villagers!

1041
02:15:11,881 --> 02:15:13,405
Nothing can stop me now!

1042
02:15:14,250 --> 02:15:16,218
l will certainly end my life!

1043
02:15:18,221 --> 02:15:22,123
Here goes; one, two, three...

1044
02:15:22,592 --> 02:15:24,457
Please, aunt! Agree to what he says!

1045
02:15:24,928 --> 02:15:27,089
You'd better agree, or do the rounds
of the courts and police stations!

1046
02:15:27,364 --> 02:15:28,922
But l've never been a court
or a police station!

1047
02:15:29,265 --> 02:15:30,630
- Then you'd better agree.
- All right.

1048
02:15:31,134 --> 02:15:35,161
Stop that, Veeru!
l agree!

1049
02:15:35,972 --> 02:15:38,668
The old lady has agreed!
Now quietly come down!

1050
02:15:40,777 --> 02:15:43,007
Who wants to marry
the old lady!

1051
02:15:43,613 --> 02:15:46,411
lt's Dhanno... l mean,
it's Basanti l want to marry.

1052
02:15:47,250 --> 02:15:51,687
l'm willing to marry you, Veeru!
Come down now!

1053
02:15:52,055 --> 02:15:54,751
Hear that, villagers?

1054
02:15:55,024 --> 02:15:59,723
The old lady is willing...
and so is Basanti!

1055
02:16:00,263 --> 02:16:03,096
So my death has been cancelled!

1056
02:16:03,500 --> 02:16:06,628
l'm coming down, aunt...
my adorable aunt!

1057
02:16:07,003 --> 02:16:08,470
l'm coming down...

1058
02:16:13,810 --> 02:16:15,971
What am l going to do now?!

1059
02:16:35,732 --> 02:16:37,825
- So long, father.
- You're leaving, are you?

1060
02:16:38,635 --> 02:16:40,500
Go on... my God protect you.

1061
02:16:40,937 --> 02:16:42,871
Write to me, the moment
you reach there.

1062
02:16:44,107 --> 02:16:48,203
You're a very careless eater;
look after your health, okay?

1063
02:16:49,279 --> 02:16:52,680
As my father, God bless his soul,
used to say...

1064
02:16:53,249 --> 02:16:57,015
...in good health lies
true happiness and wealth.

1065
02:16:58,188 --> 02:17:01,555
Let me walk with you for a while.
l'll get myself some air, too.

1066
02:17:01,891 --> 02:17:04,018
lt's okay, father. Relax...
l'll go away from here.

1067
02:17:05,195 --> 02:17:10,497
Really? Okay, then...
Let's embrace.

1068
02:17:14,971 --> 02:17:17,235
Hurry up, Junga... l hold
the Queen of clubs.

1069
02:17:17,974 --> 02:17:22,377
That's okay, Samba. But look there;
the easy prey.

1070
02:17:57,380 --> 02:17:58,847
- Chief...
- Yes?

1071
02:17:59,816 --> 02:18:01,215
This boy's from Ramgarh.

1072
02:18:02,418 --> 02:18:05,080
He was on his way to the station,
when we found him.

1073
02:19:34,377 --> 02:19:38,438
Why's there so much
of silence here?

1074
02:19:48,257 --> 02:19:50,122
- lmam-saheb...
- Who's that?

1075
02:19:51,728 --> 02:19:56,995
Veeru? Why's there so much
of silence here, son?

1076
02:19:58,301 --> 02:20:00,565
Please come with me.

1077
02:20:01,504 --> 02:20:04,268
- Please come...
- What's wrong?

1078
02:20:06,175 --> 02:20:09,736
What's up, son?
Where are you leading me...

1079
02:20:11,447 --> 02:20:12,471
Who's that?

1080
02:20:19,555 --> 02:20:20,283
Ahmed ?!

1081
02:20:22,225 --> 02:20:25,752
Ahmed!

1082
02:20:49,819 --> 02:20:53,220
lmamsaheb, l must...

1083
02:20:53,523 --> 02:20:56,583
How will you console him, Thakur?
You're responsible for all this.

1084
02:20:57,794 --> 02:20:58,818
lt's true!

1085
02:21:00,430 --> 02:21:05,868
And you villagers had better listen
to this letter from Gabbar, too!

1086
02:21:07,370 --> 02:21:10,862
Addressed to the people of Ramgarh,
it says, '' Look at the...''

1087
02:21:11,708 --> 02:21:15,542
''consequences of challenging me
at the Thakur's instigation''

1088
02:21:16,813 --> 02:21:19,680
''Should you folks still
not mend your ways...''

1089
02:21:20,216 --> 02:21:24,084
''death shall perform its ugly dance
in every courtyard of Ramgarh!''

1090
02:21:24,520 --> 02:21:28,820
''Should you care for the lives
of your family and children...''

1091
02:21:29,292 --> 02:21:31,692
'' ...then before sunrise tomorrow...''

1092
02:21:31,994 --> 02:21:37,022
'' hand over the Thakur's men
to me, at the old hillock''

1093
02:21:37,567 --> 02:21:40,798
He has signed it off as ''Gabbar
Singh, chief of the bandits.''

1094
02:21:41,671 --> 02:21:45,835
How could you land us in such
a grave danger, Thakur!

1095
02:21:56,352 --> 02:22:02,951
To lead an honorable life, we will
have to pay a price, Dinanath.

1096
02:22:04,127 --> 02:22:08,689
And we can pay the bandits
with food-grains for our lives.

1097
02:22:09,232 --> 02:22:11,700
We can't pay them with
our children's lives!

1098
02:22:12,168 --> 02:22:14,602
We're farmers, after all.
We are not soldiers.

1099
02:22:15,371 --> 02:22:19,137
You are right, Shankar.
We are indeed farmers.

1100
02:22:20,209 --> 02:22:22,973
This has been a country
of farmers for many ages.

1101
02:22:23,579 --> 02:22:27,106
But whenever someone evil has
shown aggressive designs...

1102
02:22:27,617 --> 02:22:32,554
...by God, it was farmers who
melted their ploughs into swords!

1103
02:22:33,823 --> 02:22:39,853
lt's not the blood of cowards
that flows in our veins! No!

1104
02:22:40,196 --> 02:22:43,165
But how is violence and bloodshed
going to help?

1105
02:22:43,800 --> 02:22:46,291
Non-violence has its place, too.

1106
02:22:46,869 --> 02:22:48,996
l do believe in non-violence.

1107
02:22:49,839 --> 02:22:52,069
But it won't be an
act of non-violence...

1108
02:22:52,341 --> 02:22:54,104
..to grovel before
a wicked and evil man!

1109
02:22:55,077 --> 02:22:57,068
lt's nothing but cowardliness!
Plain spinelessness!

1110
02:22:57,313 --> 02:22:59,611
Those who don't bow
are broken down, Thakur!

1111
02:23:00,349 --> 02:23:03,682
This Thakur can neither be made
to bow nor be broken down!

1112
02:23:04,921 --> 02:23:07,788
This Thakur can only die!

1113
02:23:08,758 --> 02:23:13,388
But l will live in dignity,
till as long as l live!

1114
02:23:13,796 --> 02:23:17,095
For how long are you going to live?
And how long will we live either...

1115
02:23:17,500 --> 02:23:19,127
...with these guys
around in the village?

1116
02:23:22,772 --> 02:23:26,833
lf you think you can save
your children's lives...

1117
02:23:27,143 --> 02:23:30,408
...by handing us over
to Gabbar Singh...

1118
02:23:30,746 --> 02:23:35,240
...you can very well give us
up to Gabbar. We are willing.

1119
02:23:35,618 --> 02:23:37,916
Yes. We must do
the right thing now.

1120
02:23:38,788 --> 02:23:41,382
We can't bear the burden
of this problem anymore.

1121
02:23:43,259 --> 02:23:47,127
Who's speaking of not
bearing the burden?

1122
02:23:48,297 --> 02:23:52,961
Do you know what is the biggest
burden in the world?

1123
02:23:54,937 --> 02:23:58,134
A father bearing
the bier of his son!

1124
02:23:58,941 --> 02:24:01,136
There can be no bigger burden.

1125
02:24:02,378 --> 02:24:04,869
An old man like me is willing
to bear this burden...

1126
02:24:05,348 --> 02:24:10,376
...and you refuse
to combat a problem?

1127
02:24:12,321 --> 02:24:17,452
There's something l very
strongly believe in.

1128
02:24:18,127 --> 02:24:22,655
An honorable death is any day better
than a life of humiliation.

1129
02:24:23,733 --> 02:24:26,258
lt's l, who has lost a son.

1130
02:24:27,737 --> 02:24:32,003
But l'd still want both of them
to stay on in this village.

1131
02:24:33,409 --> 02:24:35,502
l leave the rest to you.

1132
02:24:42,418 --> 02:24:44,852
lt's time for my prayers.

1133
02:24:46,222 --> 02:24:48,281
l will ask God today
why He did not give me...

1134
02:24:49,025 --> 02:24:53,985
...some more sons to be
sacrificed for the village.

1135
02:24:57,233 --> 02:25:02,034
Will someone please help me
reach the mosque...?

1136
02:26:34,263 --> 02:26:37,699
What's that? A letter?

1137
02:26:38,034 --> 02:26:39,558
Of course, you idiot!
Read it.

1138
02:26:40,069 --> 02:26:44,529
'' lf you kill one villager, Gabbar,
we will slay four of your men''

1139
02:26:46,042 --> 02:26:49,705
Check out if it's those guys, or
have they dumped someone else here?

1140
02:27:26,949 --> 02:27:34,117
'' For every villager you kill, Gabbar,
we will slay four of your men''

1141
02:27:46,035 --> 02:27:47,764
The fun begins now!

1142
02:27:49,371 --> 02:27:54,741
lt's ages since l've run into
someone who boasts so much!

1143
02:27:55,878 --> 02:27:58,108
The real fun begins now!

1144
02:28:00,015 --> 02:28:06,045
This game will end with the
lives of these two guys.

1145
02:28:07,256 --> 02:28:11,283
Every family and household in
Ramgarh, will end with this, too!

1146
02:28:18,634 --> 02:28:19,259
Here you are.

1147
02:28:23,105 --> 02:28:24,129
lt was really bothering you.

1148
02:28:42,258 --> 02:28:44,055
She's a very unfortunate girl.

1149
02:28:45,161 --> 02:28:47,652
lt's almost as if she has
forgotten to speak.

1150
02:28:48,564 --> 02:28:53,331
As for earlier, l'm always reminded
of those days...

1151
02:28:53,802 --> 02:28:57,431
...when l first visited her village
with my master.

1152
02:28:59,141 --> 02:29:00,267
lt was on the festival
of colors.

1153
02:29:00,776 --> 02:29:01,765
Hey! That's enough!

1154
02:29:03,245 --> 02:29:06,146
lt's the festival of colors!
No one can take offense!

1155
02:29:07,416 --> 02:29:10,977
How will l celebrate with your father
if you douse all the colors on me?

1156
02:29:11,086 --> 02:29:13,850
How will you celebrate the festival
with my father in any case?

1157
02:29:14,223 --> 02:29:16,088
He just doesn't know how
to celebrate the festival!

1158
02:29:16,458 --> 02:29:18,824
He's been sitting at home
all day!

1159
02:29:19,228 --> 02:29:22,629
Either he touches the feet
of the elders visiting him...

1160
02:29:22,932 --> 02:29:25,526
...or the younger ones touch his
feet as a mark of respect.

1161
02:29:26,101 --> 02:29:28,797
They apply a pinch of color on each
other's forehead from a plate...

1162
02:29:29,104 --> 02:29:33,063
...embrace each other and
that's it! They've celebrated it!

1163
02:29:33,642 --> 02:29:36,509
That's no way of doing it!
lt's us, who really celebrate it!

1164
02:29:37,513 --> 02:29:39,276
Really? And how do
you celebrate it?

1165
02:29:39,782 --> 02:29:43,616
You know Paro, don't you?

1166
02:29:43,852 --> 02:29:45,285
- Paro?
- Yes! Paro!

1167
02:29:45,754 --> 02:29:51,158
There's a tank in her courtyard.
We've mixed all the colors in it!

1168
02:29:51,493 --> 02:29:53,154
Where folks normally douse
color on people...

1169
02:29:53,429 --> 02:29:56,193
...we dump people
in the colors!

1170
02:29:56,832 --> 02:30:00,666
The moment we spot someone,
he goes straight in the tank!

1171
02:30:01,570 --> 02:30:04,368
l hope you don't have a tank
of colors in your house!

1172
02:30:04,773 --> 02:30:08,174
Or Ramlal and l will find
ourselves neck-deep in it.

1173
02:30:10,546 --> 02:30:11,570
Watch what l do!

1174
02:30:12,481 --> 02:30:13,573
Anyone in, mister?

1175
02:30:14,250 --> 02:30:15,547
Who's that?

1176
02:30:16,719 --> 02:30:20,120
- l've scared you again!
- You're crazy!

1177
02:30:21,156 --> 02:30:23,147
The Thakur!
You didn't even tell me!

1178
02:30:23,525 --> 02:30:26,016
Welcome! Greetings of the season!

1179
02:30:27,796 --> 02:30:30,390
What are you standing there for?

1180
02:30:30,866 --> 02:30:33,460
Won't you bring some sweets
for the Thakur?

1181
02:30:33,869 --> 02:30:34,995
Just a moment...

1182
02:30:35,571 --> 02:30:37,300
- Must l bring the plate too?
- Which one?

1183
02:30:37,873 --> 02:30:40,433
The one from which you will
take a pinch of color...

1184
02:30:40,676 --> 02:30:42,234
Sure, go ahead and bring it.

1185
02:30:43,879 --> 02:30:45,039
Please come, Thakur.

1186
02:30:46,248 --> 02:30:50,378
Let's go and sit there...
it's very loud out here.

1187
02:30:51,487 --> 02:30:55,014
- So, Ramlal? ls everything fine?
- l'm fine, thank you, sir.

1188
02:30:56,025 --> 02:30:58,289
Well, Thakur? l hope you've
had a nice crop this year.

1189
02:30:58,927 --> 02:31:01,191
Actually, l'm an outsider
in my own house.

1190
02:31:02,097 --> 02:31:04,964
lt's Ramlal who knows everything
about my farms.

1191
02:31:05,734 --> 02:31:07,759
lt's he who commands things
in our farms.

1192
02:31:09,738 --> 02:31:13,003
Sweets for everyone!

1193
02:31:13,275 --> 02:31:14,742
Open your mouth, uncle!

1194
02:31:16,045 --> 02:31:18,741
That's enough, dear...

1195
02:31:19,381 --> 02:31:21,246
Okay, Mr. Ramlal...
open your mouth!

1196
02:31:21,750 --> 02:31:23,980
- Give it to me, dear. l'll have it.
- No, sir!

1197
02:31:24,219 --> 02:31:25,481
- l will feed you!
- Give it to me, dear.

1198
02:31:26,055 --> 02:31:30,583
She's like your daughter, Ramlal.
Let her feed you.

1199
02:31:30,993 --> 02:31:34,394
He's right. Now open your mouth!

1200
02:31:36,432 --> 02:31:38,627
My God! How could l forget the
plate with the colors?

1201
02:31:40,903 --> 02:31:41,961
She's a very jovial girl.

1202
02:31:42,371 --> 02:31:46,273
You bet! She's always
kicking up a racket!

1203
02:31:46,542 --> 02:31:48,908
Here l come with
the plate of colors!

1204
02:31:49,211 --> 02:31:53,841
Here's the plate of colors for you
to take a pinch out of it!

1205
02:31:54,216 --> 02:31:57,185
- l'm leaving!
- Where are you going?

1206
02:31:58,220 --> 02:32:02,054
l'm going to my friends to celebrate!
May l leave?

1207
02:32:03,859 --> 02:32:05,759
Haven't you had enough
of the colors yet?

1208
02:32:06,495 --> 02:32:11,125
lt's a festival of colors, uncle...
of all hues!

1209
02:32:13,936 --> 02:32:15,267
How can anyone ever have
enough of the colors?

1210
02:32:15,771 --> 02:32:18,103
Tell me; wouldn't the world be
so dull, without these colors?

1211
02:32:18,407 --> 02:32:21,240
How dull and lifeless her world
has suddenly come to be.

1212
02:32:27,516 --> 02:32:32,317
With her tears having washed away
her bridal-henna...

1213
02:32:32,654 --> 02:32:38,615
...what colors can
she look forward to in life?

1214
02:34:06,815 --> 02:34:12,845
l've taken a decision.

1215
02:34:13,655 --> 02:34:16,783
Really? So you've started
taking decisions too?!

1216
02:34:17,493 --> 02:34:22,328
Yes. When you are into it,
l think l'd rather do it too.

1217
02:34:22,764 --> 02:34:24,425
- What is that?
- Get married.

1218
02:34:24,900 --> 02:34:27,266
Get married ?!

1219
02:34:29,805 --> 02:34:30,931
You want to get married?!

1220
02:34:31,540 --> 02:34:33,872
Yes... l've had enough.

1221
02:34:34,910 --> 02:34:38,346
l've now decided to lead
a straight and simple life.

1222
02:34:39,047 --> 02:34:42,983
ln which l have a house of my own,
a wife, many children...

1223
02:34:43,652 --> 02:34:46,246
...who will pester you
for stories...

1224
02:34:46,488 --> 02:34:50,447
Hey! That's enough!
Sit down here, will you?

1225
02:34:50,759 --> 02:34:52,351
Sit down here, l say.

1226
02:34:54,129 --> 02:34:58,293
l hope you know that you need
a girl to get married to?

1227
02:34:59,501 --> 02:35:01,935
Have you approved of a girl then?

1228
02:35:02,504 --> 02:35:05,735
- Yes, l have.
- Who is she, may l ask?

1229
02:35:11,446 --> 02:35:12,310
That Radha?!

1230
02:35:13,715 --> 02:35:16,115
Are you mad? Don't you know
who she is?

1231
02:35:17,219 --> 02:35:23,647
Now look; even thugs and criminals
are given a second chance in life.

1232
02:35:24,293 --> 02:35:25,760
And then, Radha has done
nothing wrong.

1233
02:35:26,995 --> 02:35:29,156
Has she no right to start
life afresh?

1234
02:35:29,631 --> 02:35:34,159
How can that be? What will society
and community think of it?

1235
02:35:35,037 --> 02:35:40,839
The society and community are meant
to save man from loneliness.

1236
02:35:41,977 --> 02:35:44,070
They're not meant to
isolate someone.

1237
02:35:45,180 --> 02:35:49,640
Besides, must we let Radha suffer
in silence for fear of society?

1238
02:35:52,487 --> 02:35:57,254
How long are we going to live
anyway? We might soon be dead.

1239
02:35:58,160 --> 02:36:01,755
Whose support will she live on?
Whom will she turn to?

1240
02:36:03,432 --> 02:36:05,696
lt was because of all this
that l came to you.

1241
02:36:07,135 --> 02:36:11,162
But you are her father.
l leave the decision to you.

1242
02:36:11,707 --> 02:36:13,902
Not at all, Thakur.
She's your daughter now.

1243
02:36:14,876 --> 02:36:18,778
Whatever you decide will be
best for her.

1244
02:36:20,315 --> 02:36:23,978
l'd still want you to
meet Jai at least once.

1245
02:36:25,120 --> 02:36:27,054
l'll send him over
in a couple of days.

1246
02:36:44,072 --> 02:36:45,596
A penny for your thoughts!

1247
02:36:46,742 --> 02:36:49,176
lt's nothing.

1248
02:36:50,312 --> 02:36:54,214
l get it! l know what
you're worrying about.

1249
02:36:55,350 --> 02:36:59,878
You're wondering whether your
proposal will come through.

1250
02:37:00,355 --> 02:37:02,380
l suggest you toss again.

1251
02:37:03,025 --> 02:37:07,689
lf it's Heads, it's gonna
be okay. Or else... well!

1252
02:37:09,765 --> 02:37:15,533
lf everything works out
well, Veeru...

1253
02:37:16,705 --> 02:37:19,833
...why don't we settle down here,
in this village?

1254
02:37:20,142 --> 02:37:22,110
There! You've spoken my heart!

1255
02:37:23,045 --> 02:37:24,979
l've been thinking of this, too.

1256
02:37:25,547 --> 02:37:27,674
lt's no use being thieves
all our lives.

1257
02:37:28,216 --> 02:37:29,706
We've spent enough time
in the prisons.

1258
02:37:30,285 --> 02:37:33,584
Once we get the money,
let's settle down here.

1259
02:37:33,922 --> 02:37:36,322
We'll buy some land and
turn farmers.

1260
02:37:37,392 --> 02:37:42,125
But we can't use the plough...
how will we be farmers?

1261
02:37:42,731 --> 02:37:48,431
Our vices taught us to wield guns;
our virtues will teach us this.

1262
02:37:48,804 --> 02:37:52,103
You're right. Necessity does
teach a man a lot in life.

1263
02:37:52,541 --> 02:37:55,135
l've already worked out
everything for myself!

1264
02:37:55,377 --> 02:37:56,571
l'll marry the girl
who drives the horse-cart...

1265
02:37:56,945 --> 02:37:59,914
...and be the father of a
couple of children in 2/3 years.

1266
02:38:00,515 --> 02:38:02,449
l've even thought
of the brats' names!

1267
02:38:02,884 --> 02:38:06,945
And when l ask my wife
where the kids are...

1268
02:38:07,289 --> 02:38:08,586
She'll say...

1269
02:38:08,990 --> 02:38:13,484
''They must be with your friend Jai
to listen to his stories''

1270
02:38:14,896 --> 02:38:20,061
Why must you always send your
children to me for stories?

1271
02:38:20,702 --> 02:38:24,536
You know l can't remember
these bloody stories, Jai!

1272
02:38:25,207 --> 02:38:29,041
Stories, my foot! You don't even
remember what happened yesterday.

1273
02:38:29,344 --> 02:38:32,745
Yesterday? Of course l remember
l met Basanti yesterday!

1274
02:38:33,248 --> 02:38:35,910
We've promised to meet
at the lake this morning!

1275
02:38:37,519 --> 02:38:38,781
- This morning, huh?
- Yes!

1276
02:38:40,589 --> 02:38:41,385
Here l go!

1277
02:39:01,276 --> 02:39:02,334
Let's go, Dhanno!

1278
02:39:12,154 --> 02:39:16,250
Let's go! lt's a question
of my chastity today!

1279
02:39:43,852 --> 02:39:48,084
Go on, Dhanno! Faster!

1280
02:40:24,960 --> 02:40:27,793
Faster, Dhanno! Go for it!

1281
02:43:00,982 --> 02:43:06,010
What do these guys in Ramgarh
feed their daughters with?

1282
02:43:07,288 --> 02:43:13,158
Look at her... she's one hell
of a spicy doll, isn't she?

1283
02:43:15,230 --> 02:43:16,458
Damn spicy, all right!

1284
02:43:17,165 --> 02:43:21,864
Remember how we went to Jamnadas's
daughter's wedding last year, chief?

1285
02:43:22,237 --> 02:43:24,000
She'd given them a terrific
dance performance there.

1286
02:43:24,539 --> 02:43:25,233
Wow!

1287
02:43:26,708 --> 02:43:29,905
She must be a sizzling dancer!

1288
02:43:31,279 --> 02:43:34,908
Show us a couple
of steps, darling.

1289
02:43:35,750 --> 02:43:39,777
Now look, lady... don't you
act too high and mighty!

1290
02:43:40,321 --> 02:43:46,089
Or l'll scratch off this
beautiful skin... all right?

1291
02:43:52,067 --> 02:43:55,525
Wait a minute, darling.

1292
02:43:59,841 --> 02:44:01,172
Tie the bastard!

1293
02:44:10,051 --> 02:44:13,452
You seem to be thick with him,
what say?

1294
02:44:20,295 --> 02:44:25,927
Well, strong man? Mohammad
comes to the mountain, eh?

1295
02:44:26,634 --> 02:44:30,730
You have a scene with
that babe, do you?

1296
02:44:31,139 --> 02:44:36,736
You bastard! l've yet to see
a creep like you!

1297
02:44:37,612 --> 02:44:39,273
You won't get to see one either.

1298
02:44:42,517 --> 02:44:45,418
Because your life is
now going to end.

1299
02:44:46,087 --> 02:44:48,078
- The bastard...
- No!

1300
02:45:00,101 --> 02:45:03,400
Like a house on fire, eh?

1301
02:45:08,076 --> 02:45:10,738
You're pretty thick, aren't you?

1302
02:45:12,347 --> 02:45:16,977
Pick up your gun, Samba!

1303
02:45:18,386 --> 02:45:22,823
And aim your gun at this cur!

1304
02:45:26,294 --> 02:45:28,023
Now listen to me, darling.

1305
02:45:28,763 --> 02:45:34,531
lf you wish to save your lover,
show us some dance.

1306
02:45:34,836 --> 02:45:39,864
No! Don't you dare dance
before this dogs, Basanti!

1307
02:45:46,014 --> 02:45:50,576
Delay this any longer, and we'll
blow your lover's head apart!

1308
02:45:52,287 --> 02:45:56,553
There's another thing
l must tell you, darling.

1309
02:45:56,824 --> 02:46:00,487
That man will breathe,
only till you continue to dance.

1310
02:46:02,030 --> 02:46:06,296
That gun will go off, the
moment your feet stop moving.

1311
02:52:09,130 --> 02:52:12,429
lf anyone dare moves,
he's gonna be dead meat!

1312
02:52:15,303 --> 02:52:19,763
Gabbar Singh! Ask your men
to drop their guns!

1313
02:52:24,345 --> 02:52:25,312
Go on

1314
02:53:47,662 --> 02:53:49,596
Go after them! Go on!

1315
02:53:50,831 --> 02:53:53,197
And don't return empty-handed,
you bastards!

1316
02:53:55,603 --> 02:53:56,467
Hurry up!

1317
02:55:28,763 --> 02:55:30,993
- Jai! Are you all right?
- Yes, l'm okay.

1318
02:55:34,635 --> 02:55:38,093
The three of us can't escape
on a single horse, Veeru.

1319
02:55:38,873 --> 02:55:43,071
Take Basanti away to the village
and return soon.

1320
02:55:43,377 --> 02:55:48,076
And bring lots of ammunition
when you return.

1321
02:55:48,949 --> 02:55:52,146
No! l will stay here!
Take Basanti and leave quickly!

1322
02:55:53,354 --> 02:55:56,289
Listen to me, Veeru!
Take Basanti away! l'll stay here.

1323
02:55:57,625 --> 02:55:59,422
No, Jai! l can't leave you alone.

1324
02:56:00,561 --> 02:56:02,495
One of us will have to go, Veeru.

1325
02:56:02,930 --> 02:56:04,898
Or else, we'll soon
run out of bullets.

1326
02:56:06,634 --> 02:56:09,626
Well, all right.
Let's toss instead.

1327
02:56:10,371 --> 02:56:12,896
lf it's Heads, l stay back.
lf it's Tails, you hold fort.

1328
02:56:17,411 --> 02:56:18,207
l win!

1329
02:56:23,083 --> 02:56:25,551
- But how can you be...
- No more arguments, Veeru!

1330
02:56:25,886 --> 02:56:28,446
Leave your gun and bullets behind.
And take Basanti out quickly! Go on!

1331
02:56:35,963 --> 02:56:38,022
l somehow don't feel like
leaving you alone, Jai.

1332
02:56:38,866 --> 02:56:41,460
- Take care, okay?
- Sure.

1333
03:00:39,273 --> 03:00:40,535
There's just one bullet!

1334
03:01:49,643 --> 03:01:54,103
- Are you okay, Jai?!
- Yes... l'm okay.

1335
03:01:54,948 --> 03:01:59,476
l've killed every
single bastard before...

1336
03:01:59,987 --> 03:02:04,754
Don't worry, Jai!
Just don't be scared!

1337
03:02:05,726 --> 03:02:09,093
Why must l be scared when
you're with me, Veeru?

1338
03:02:09,830 --> 03:02:12,958
Let's return to our village!
Everything will be all right!

1339
03:02:13,934 --> 03:02:16,960
My game is up, Veeru.

1340
03:02:17,204 --> 03:02:19,069
- lt's all over...
- No!

1341
03:02:19,540 --> 03:02:22,441
No, Jai! Don't say such things!

1342
03:02:23,410 --> 03:02:27,176
But l have no regrets, Veeru.

1343
03:02:27,748 --> 03:02:32,014
l have lived for my friend...
and am dying before him!

1344
03:02:32,653 --> 03:02:36,589
But there is something
l'm leaving unfinished, Veeru.

1345
03:02:36,890 --> 03:02:38,824
l won't be able to tell
stories to your children.

1346
03:02:39,092 --> 03:02:41,822
You're going to be all right, Jai!
Nothing will happen to you!

1347
03:02:42,095 --> 03:02:48,227
But you must tell your children
tales of our friendship and exploits.

1348
03:02:48,535 --> 03:02:49,900
You won't forget that, will you?

1349
03:02:50,204 --> 03:02:51,466
What nonsense are you talking?!

1350
03:02:56,410 --> 03:02:57,775
Look there, Veeru...

1351
03:03:04,885 --> 03:03:07,251
There's yet another
incomplete story, Veeru.

1352
03:03:08,388 --> 03:03:11,516
What had l dreamed of;
and what has come to be?

1353
03:03:11,758 --> 03:03:15,524
No, Jai!
You can't leave me like this!

1354
03:03:18,031 --> 03:03:18,929
No!

1355
03:03:19,499 --> 03:03:23,128
No, Jai! Please don't!

1356
03:03:23,670 --> 03:03:30,337
No, Jai!
You can't do this to me!

1357
03:06:13,673 --> 03:06:21,136
Jai! You have cheated me
to save my life?

1358
03:06:26,219 --> 03:06:28,687
l swear upon the blood
that you have shed!

1359
03:06:29,990 --> 03:06:34,791
l will pick and choose each
one of them, and give them death!

1360
03:06:35,629 --> 03:06:39,190
Gabbar Singh!
l'm coming after you!

1361
03:07:32,018 --> 03:07:32,712
Run! But how far
will you go, you swine!

1362
03:07:41,628 --> 03:07:44,620
Gabbar! Come out in the open!

1363
03:07:45,565 --> 03:07:47,965
Face me like a man,
you bastard!

1364
03:07:48,735 --> 03:07:53,331
l've come to avenge every drop
of blood that my friend has shed!

1365
03:07:53,874 --> 03:07:56,866
You can't escape death today!

1366
03:09:30,203 --> 03:09:37,575
Hand him over to me, Veeru.

1367
03:09:38,044 --> 03:09:43,107
No, Thakur! l'm not going to
let this bastard live anymore!

1368
03:09:43,650 --> 03:09:45,311
Don't forget your promise, Veeru!

1369
03:09:45,619 --> 03:09:47,143
l don't remember anything!

1370
03:09:47,554 --> 03:09:52,116
All l know is that this bastard's
men have killed my friend!

1371
03:09:52,892 --> 03:09:55,087
And l'm going to have
his blood for that!

1372
03:09:55,662 --> 03:09:59,564
lt was that very friend of yours
who had made a promise to me.

1373
03:10:01,534 --> 03:10:03,195
Leave him alone.

1374
03:10:13,647 --> 03:10:20,416
l wish it was l who had made the
promise; l'd have broken it today!

1375
03:10:21,321 --> 03:10:24,984
But it was my friend
who gave you his word.

1376
03:10:25,358 --> 03:10:26,120
So,...

1377
03:11:12,605 --> 03:11:19,602
You can't fight me, Thakur!
l've already cut your arms!

1378
03:11:21,047 --> 03:11:26,383
One uses his feet, not his hands,
to crush the snake, Gabbar!

1379
03:11:27,287 --> 03:11:31,451
My feet are enough
to deal with you!

1380
03:11:54,347 --> 03:11:57,874
Your arms are full of
strength, aren't they?

1381
03:12:55,108 --> 03:12:58,805
Gabbar! Give your hands to me!

1382
03:12:59,345 --> 03:13:00,175
No!

1383
03:13:01,214 --> 03:13:02,841
Give me this hand, Gabbar!

1384
03:13:04,217 --> 03:13:05,684
No!

1385
03:14:27,400 --> 03:14:28,367
Let him go!

1386
03:14:30,970 --> 03:14:33,632
lt is up to the justice system to...
punish a criminal.

1387
03:14:35,909 --> 03:14:38,571
Justice needs Gabbar...

1388
03:14:39,112 --> 03:14:43,811
Dead or alive!

1389
03:14:44,083 --> 03:14:47,883
Your emotions have overcome your...
duties and responsibilities?

1390
03:14:51,624 --> 03:14:54,616
Justice does not have any respect left?

1391
03:15:00,066 --> 03:15:03,194
Thakur Sahib...l know of your sufferings.

1392
03:15:04,370 --> 03:15:07,498
But don't forget...that you've been...
such a police officer...

1393
03:15:08,007 --> 03:15:09,838
that you are still idolized today.

1394
03:16:49,776 --> 03:16:52,904
Well, Thakur...
l must leave now.

1395
03:16:58,284 --> 03:17:00,878
l know l can't share your grief;
