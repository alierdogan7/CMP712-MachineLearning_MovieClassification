1
00:01:31,203 --> 00:01:36,607
By late in the 21st century the nations
of the Earth were finally at peace,

2
00:01:36,708 --> 00:01:42,146
working together to explore
and colonize the distant reaches of space.

3
00:01:47,919 --> 00:01:51,411
Unfortunately, we weren't alone out there.

4
00:01:52,391 --> 00:01:56,828
A race of nonhuman aliens called the Dracs
were claiming squatters'rights

5
00:01:56,928 --> 00:02:00,796
to some of the richest
star systems in the galaxy.

6
00:02:00,866 --> 00:02:04,859
Well, they weren't
gonna get it without a fight.

7
00:02:10,609 --> 00:02:13,544
Space was the new battleground.

8
00:02:13,612 --> 00:02:19,073
For many of us, Earth became
a precious memory light years away.

9
00:02:22,788 --> 00:02:26,189
Our only home was a fortress in space.

10
00:02:26,258 --> 00:02:31,355
As in any war, there were long periods
with nothing to do but wait.

11
00:02:31,963 --> 00:02:34,056
And then...

12
00:02:43,775 --> 00:02:48,644
All personnel to battle stations.
Prepare to launch. This is not an exercise.

13
00:02:48,747 --> 00:02:53,241
All personnel to battle stations.
Prepare to launch. This is not an exercise.

14
00:03:02,627 --> 00:03:06,222
Flight Leader, this is Echo Two.
Four bandits at three o'clock.

15
00:03:06,331 --> 00:03:08,925
Roger, Echo Two. I copy.
Right 90 and go for it.

16
00:03:15,407 --> 00:03:18,535
Echo Six to Flight Leader.
They're pulling the yellow line.

17
00:03:18,610 --> 00:03:22,068
Roger, Echo Six.
Cleared hot one-on-one with two backup.

18
00:03:25,751 --> 00:03:29,687
Let's snuff 'em and get home early.
I got a hot date with Murcheson.

19
00:03:29,821 --> 00:03:33,348
- The nurse?
- This time she's gonna give in, I guarantee it.

20
00:03:33,425 --> 00:03:36,758
Isn't that the same Murcheson
we called the White Balloon?

21
00:03:36,828 --> 00:03:39,592
Come on, she's lost 20 pounds.

22
00:03:42,267 --> 00:03:43,962
- Gotcha.
- Attaboy.

23
00:03:44,035 --> 00:03:45,900
- Yeah.
- Six more bandits on three.

24
00:03:48,573 --> 00:03:51,599
- Leader, copy?
- Roger. They thought we didn't see 'em.

25
00:03:51,676 --> 00:03:54,509
- Well, I didn't. Did anybody see 'em?
- I see 'em now.

26
00:04:01,019 --> 00:04:02,577
- Well?
- Bandit on zero.

27
00:04:05,457 --> 00:04:07,015
Hold on to your lunch, Joey.

28
00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:13,029
Echo Six, bandits closing.

29
00:04:13,098 --> 00:04:15,931
- Where is he, Will?
- He's right on your damn...

30
00:04:18,003 --> 00:04:19,664
- Oh, Jesus.
- Bastard.

31
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:26,035
- How many Ks we got left?
- Another 65, but we'll have a heat problem.

32
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:31,909
- What the hell's Will doing?
- Say your prayers, toadface.

33
00:04:33,351 --> 00:04:35,216
Shit.

34
00:04:37,122 --> 00:04:39,215
Engine heat beyond normal.

35
00:04:40,025 --> 00:04:44,519
Blast him and let's go. That's Fyrine IV
down there. Unexplored territory.

36
00:04:44,629 --> 00:04:46,824
OK, Joey.

37
00:04:54,973 --> 00:04:57,669
- We're hitting atmosphere.
- Visors down.

38
00:04:59,711 --> 00:05:01,941
I lost him. What's on the scope?

39
00:05:02,047 --> 00:05:06,450
- Willy, pull outta here. We're gonna burn up.
- Dammit. Where is he?

40
00:05:07,285 --> 00:05:10,083
He ejected. He's out. The bastard's out.

41
00:05:16,895 --> 00:05:18,795
Come on, Joey. We're punching out.

42
00:05:19,998 --> 00:05:22,990
Oh, shit. Get your nose up.

43
00:05:24,469 --> 00:05:26,528
Come on. Get your nose up.

44
00:05:27,672 --> 00:05:29,731
That's it.

45
00:05:32,944 --> 00:05:35,572
Get up. Get up. Easy.

46
00:05:47,826 --> 00:05:49,919
Come on, Joey.

47
00:05:52,898 --> 00:05:55,366
Come on.

48
00:06:11,983 --> 00:06:15,817
- You OK, Will?
- Yeah. I'm fine.

49
00:06:19,257 --> 00:06:22,192
When you see Murcheson,

50
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:25,457
just don't call her the White Balloon anymore.

51
00:06:26,364 --> 00:06:29,265
- It hurts her feelings.
- OK, Joey.

52
00:06:29,768 --> 00:06:32,066
And don't let the guys call her that.

53
00:06:34,673 --> 00:06:36,766
I liked her.

54
00:06:39,577 --> 00:06:42,808
It's a promise, Joey.
Now you be still. You lay quiet.

55
00:06:43,648 --> 00:06:45,616
- Will?
- What?

56
00:06:46,952 --> 00:06:49,386
I'm really tired.

57
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:04,495
Hey, Joey.

58
00:07:09,307 --> 00:07:11,400
I'm sorry, Joey.

59
00:07:13,678 --> 00:07:15,771
I'm sorry.

60
00:07:49,681 --> 00:07:52,149
I could see where the Drac fighter went down.

61
00:07:53,251 --> 00:07:56,914
Its ejection capsule
couldn't be far from the wreck.

62
00:07:57,022 --> 00:08:00,685
I just hoped it wasn't dead yet.

63
00:08:07,298 --> 00:08:11,564
It's funny, but I'd never actually seen a Drac.

64
00:08:11,669 --> 00:08:14,502
I knew they were completely inhuman.

65
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:17,073
Not even male or female,

66
00:08:17,142 --> 00:08:22,136
but both, bundled together
in a scaly, reptilian body.

67
00:15:59,203 --> 00:16:02,229
Burn, you mother. Burn.

68
00:16:16,187 --> 00:16:18,621
You blew it, toadface.

69
00:17:05,903 --> 00:17:08,201
Hey, Drac. I'm hungry.

70
00:17:09,473 --> 00:17:13,432
Hungry. You understand that? Hungry? Huh?

71
00:17:22,787 --> 00:17:25,847
Hey, you understand any English, toadface?

72
00:17:42,707 --> 00:17:45,039
What? Urgh.

73
00:17:49,947 --> 00:17:51,437
Stick it.

74
00:17:57,021 --> 00:17:59,854
So your name's Jerry Shigan. So what?

75
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:12,095
What? D'you wanna know my name?

76
00:18:12,169 --> 00:18:15,104
Willis E Davidge.

77
00:18:20,911 --> 00:18:22,970
How about some food?

78
00:18:23,981 --> 00:18:26,541
Some food? Give me some food.

79
00:18:29,487 --> 00:18:32,115
Food.

80
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:04,979
You're kidding.

81
00:19:56,574 --> 00:19:59,839
Oh, Drac. Wake up, Drac. Wake up.

82
00:19:59,944 --> 00:20:02,344
Cut me loose.

83
00:20:04,548 --> 00:20:07,176
Help me. Cut me loose.

84
00:20:09,153 --> 00:20:11,212
Help me.

85
00:20:32,076 --> 00:20:34,169
Yeah, you said it.

86
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:57,991
No.

87
00:21:59,730 --> 00:22:04,292
Look, Drac. I coulda killed you easy.
You owe me one.

88
00:22:05,002 --> 00:22:08,995
What'd you say your name was?
Your name? Your name?

89
00:22:09,106 --> 00:22:11,336
Jeriba Shigan.

90
00:22:11,709 --> 00:22:14,075
All right.

91
00:22:14,144 --> 00:22:16,271
All right. Now, listen.

92
00:22:18,916 --> 00:22:21,407
Listen. Listen.

93
00:22:21,719 --> 00:22:24,711
Meteors fall here.

94
00:22:26,757 --> 00:22:32,320
- Many meteors. You understand "meteors"?
- Meteors?

95
00:22:35,399 --> 00:22:39,130
Zeerki fall here. Many zeerki. No?

96
00:22:39,203 --> 00:22:42,764
We're out in the open.

97
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:49,211
If we stay here, we... we die. Die.

98
00:22:50,948 --> 00:22:52,643
Die.

99
00:22:52,750 --> 00:22:59,383
Yeah. What we gotta do
is we gotta take all the... the...

100
00:22:59,456 --> 00:23:02,619
the goodies out of that thing of yours.

101
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:04,950
Yeah, neesay.

102
00:23:05,029 --> 00:23:07,657
Naesay. Naesay. Yeah, naesay.

103
00:23:07,765 --> 00:23:12,828
And get our butts up
higher in the forest. Up there.

104
00:23:12,937 --> 00:23:16,964
At least there's some cover up there.
Cover? You know "cover"?

105
00:23:26,283 --> 00:23:28,581
Exactly.

106
00:23:30,654 --> 00:23:32,884
I'm glad you agree.

107
00:23:37,194 --> 00:23:39,253
Yeah, yeah.

108
00:23:46,270 --> 00:23:51,037
Next time, huh. I'll put
that knife right up your kazoo.

109
00:23:51,108 --> 00:23:53,201
If you've got one.

110
00:24:05,889 --> 00:24:07,789
OK, toadface.

111
00:24:07,858 --> 00:24:10,850
You gonna shoot me? Go ahead. 
Shoot me.

112
00:24:10,928 --> 00:24:14,091
Come on, shoot me.
Go ahead and do it now. Shoot me.

113
00:24:14,198 --> 00:24:17,793
Cos whether we live or die,
I don't love you and you don't love me.

114
00:24:17,868 --> 00:24:23,397
But we're stranded here, you understand?
You get it or don't you gavey Engleesh, huh?

115
00:24:32,216 --> 00:24:34,081
Yeah, phtuga.

116
00:24:34,151 --> 00:24:36,847
Write and tell my mother, you big frog.

117
00:24:38,222 --> 00:24:40,087
Look.

118
00:24:40,524 --> 00:24:43,049
We've got to...

119
00:24:43,127 --> 00:24:47,427
What we gotta do is
we have to build a shelter. With stones.

120
00:24:48,098 --> 00:24:51,932
Shelter. You gavey? Shelter?

121
00:24:55,539 --> 00:24:57,734
It was slow going.

122
00:24:57,841 --> 00:25:04,542
Since I had to communicate with that lizard,
I tried learning a few words of its crude lingo.

123
00:25:05,983 --> 00:25:07,610
Hey, Drac.

124
00:25:07,684 --> 00:25:09,675
Drac...

125
00:25:17,961 --> 00:25:19,588
Forget it.

126
00:25:19,696 --> 00:25:22,187
Enough talk. Let's get on with it, huh?

127
00:25:23,867 --> 00:25:25,698
Shit.

128
00:25:33,510 --> 00:25:37,071
Of course, the Drac was picking up
a few words of English, too.

129
00:25:37,147 --> 00:25:39,411
- Yeah.
- Shit.

130
00:25:40,818 --> 00:25:43,378
Shit? What do you mean, "shit"?

131
00:25:44,354 --> 00:25:46,413
No solid.

132
00:25:48,092 --> 00:25:50,151
"No solid." I'll show you.

133
00:25:56,533 --> 00:25:58,831
Not solid.

134
00:26:19,156 --> 00:26:22,057
My left foot.

135
00:26:22,159 --> 00:26:25,526
My right foot.

136
00:26:25,596 --> 00:26:29,259
This is my left foot.

137
00:26:30,801 --> 00:26:34,567
This is my right foot.

138
00:26:36,073 --> 00:26:39,668
And these are both my feet.

139
00:26:39,776 --> 00:26:42,643
- Yeah, great.
- Yeah, great.

140
00:26:42,746 --> 00:26:45,442
This is my head.

141
00:26:45,549 --> 00:26:47,813
That is your ugly head.

142
00:26:48,085 --> 00:26:49,780
No, no.

143
00:26:49,887 --> 00:26:54,256
This is my head. That's is you head.

144
00:26:54,358 --> 00:26:56,826
You ugly head.

145
00:27:06,403 --> 00:27:10,965
That is Davidge ugly head.

146
00:27:12,209 --> 00:27:14,370
All right, that's enough.

147
00:27:14,444 --> 00:27:19,438
Keep that up and you can learn English alone
because I won't be your teacher anymore.

148
00:27:19,516 --> 00:27:22,041
Sorry, Davidge.

149
00:27:23,420 --> 00:27:25,513
That's better.

150
00:27:25,622 --> 00:27:30,423
You know, while you're having
such a good time and doing nothing,

151
00:27:30,494 --> 00:27:34,453
I am trying to think of ways
to improve our situation.

152
00:27:34,665 --> 00:27:37,691
- OK.
- You know the old saying:

153
00:27:37,801 --> 00:27:42,431
If at first you don't succeed,
try, try again.

154
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:48,468
Davidge, you learn this
from great Drac teacher, Shizumaat?

155
00:27:49,746 --> 00:27:52,647
- No, from Mickey Mouse.
- Who?

156
00:27:59,890 --> 00:28:02,324
Is this great Irkmann teacher?

157
00:28:04,361 --> 00:28:06,329
Yeah.

158
00:28:06,430 --> 00:28:08,091
Sort of.

159
00:28:22,746 --> 00:28:24,839
Uh, forget it.

160
00:29:24,141 --> 00:29:26,166
Mm. Delish.

161
00:29:26,243 --> 00:29:27,733
Have one.

162
00:29:29,946 --> 00:29:32,506
Don't forget who helped me acquire the taste.

163
00:29:34,151 --> 00:29:37,848
Besides, I'm going to improve the menu.

164
00:29:39,056 --> 00:29:41,115
Soon we picked up.

165
00:29:41,191 --> 00:29:44,592
One side or other side.

166
00:29:44,961 --> 00:29:47,452
What, with the war going on?

167
00:29:47,564 --> 00:29:50,260
We got more chance of
catching a Greyhound bus.

168
00:29:51,068 --> 00:29:53,059
Humans.

169
00:29:53,170 --> 00:29:55,570
Easy you give up.

170
00:29:55,639 --> 00:30:03,239
Shizumaat teaches us
"Intelligent life takes a stand."

171
00:30:04,948 --> 00:30:08,475
Where'd you get that crap?
Out of that book you're always readin'?

172
00:30:08,585 --> 00:30:14,490
I'm the one that's takin' a stand. I wouldn't
be here if it wasn't for you sons of Shit-mat.

173
00:30:14,591 --> 00:30:17,856
- Shizumaat.
- Yeah, whatever.

174
00:30:17,961 --> 00:30:21,158
This war begun by you. By humans.

175
00:30:21,231 --> 00:30:25,600
You know something, Jerry?
Your great Shizumaat eats shit.

176
00:30:28,638 --> 00:30:36,409
Irkmann, your Mickey Mousssse
is one big, stupid dope.

177
00:30:45,322 --> 00:30:47,586
Yay. Meat.

178
00:30:47,657 --> 00:30:51,252
Hey, mother. You stay there,
you mother. Hey. Hey. Hey. Aha.

179
00:30:57,734 --> 00:31:01,727
You dirty, rotten son of a bitch.

180
00:31:06,009 --> 00:31:07,874
Shit.

181
00:31:17,487 --> 00:31:19,546
Hey, goddamn.

182
00:31:56,259 --> 00:31:57,886
Get outta here.

183
00:32:34,097 --> 00:32:36,930
Oh. Get me outta here.

184
00:32:42,305 --> 00:32:44,136
God.

185
00:33:07,364 --> 00:33:09,423
Thank you.

186
00:33:15,839 --> 00:33:17,932
Go ahead.

187
00:33:20,410 --> 00:33:23,072
Argh. Oh. God.

188
00:33:29,853 --> 00:33:31,946
You saved my life.

189
00:33:33,223 --> 00:33:39,389
- Why?
- Maybe I need to look at another face.

190
00:33:40,664 --> 00:33:44,259
Even as ugly as yours.

191
00:33:44,601 --> 00:33:47,570
So you still think humans are ugly, huh?

192
00:33:47,637 --> 00:33:51,403
Compared to a Drac, very ugly.

193
00:33:52,709 --> 00:33:58,238
But that thing out there,
it's even more ugly than you.

194
00:33:59,416 --> 00:34:03,375
- Thank you.
- You are welcome.

195
00:34:18,902 --> 00:34:21,200
Ha-ha. That's it.

196
00:34:22,205 --> 00:34:27,541
Even that thing under the ground couldn't
bite through this. I bet they're meteor-proof.

197
00:34:27,644 --> 00:34:30,078
They're meteor-proof.

198
00:34:30,814 --> 00:34:34,306
- What?
- Zeerki-proof. Zeerki-proof.

199
00:34:37,887 --> 00:34:40,685
Jerry, old Drac,

200
00:34:40,824 --> 00:34:44,954
- where would you be without me, huh?
- Back home.

201
00:34:54,504 --> 00:34:56,563
Aw, shit.

202
00:34:58,842 --> 00:35:02,505
Hey, Professor, how about a little help, huh?

203
00:35:09,586 --> 00:35:12,555
Don't you ever get tired of reading that book?

204
00:35:14,257 --> 00:35:16,122
No.

205
00:35:18,161 --> 00:35:20,686
Well, what's in it anyway?

206
00:35:20,764 --> 00:35:22,857
Things.

207
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:25,527
Oh, for Christ's sake.

208
00:35:28,505 --> 00:35:32,066
It is called Talman.

209
00:35:32,142 --> 00:35:37,205
It contains the words
of our great teacher, Shizumaat.

210
00:35:37,313 --> 00:35:41,147
I suppose you have to know
the Drac language to read it, right?

211
00:35:41,251 --> 00:35:43,219
It would help.

212
00:35:44,954 --> 00:35:47,013
So teach me the Drac language.

213
00:35:49,159 --> 00:35:51,218
It is not for you, Davidge.

214
00:35:51,628 --> 00:35:54,119
Shizumaat is too good for us humans?

215
00:35:54,264 --> 00:35:58,963
- Not too good for humans, too good for you.
- Now you're ajudge of character.

216
00:35:59,035 --> 00:36:01,595
Do you not remember
what you say about Shizumaat?

217
00:36:01,771 --> 00:36:06,071
Yeah, well, maybe you forgot about
what you said about Mickey Mouse.

218
00:36:06,176 --> 00:36:08,235
That was wrong.

219
00:36:10,380 --> 00:36:13,281
I did not mean it.

220
00:36:20,490 --> 00:36:23,391
I didn't mean what I said
about Shizumaat either.

221
00:36:42,312 --> 00:36:44,405
Jerry, what are you...

222
00:36:48,251 --> 00:36:53,655
This book must be given to the pupil.

223
00:36:55,391 --> 00:36:59,259
I then become the master.

224
00:37:00,630 --> 00:37:05,090
I am not worthy, 
but there is no one else here.

225
00:37:16,913 --> 00:37:19,006
Now read.

226
00:37:35,932 --> 00:37:39,368
Time passed, as time does.

227
00:37:44,908 --> 00:37:47,843
We ate, we slept.

228
00:37:49,846 --> 00:37:55,250
And sometimes I listened to the skies
for some faint hope of rescue.

229
00:38:21,778 --> 00:38:26,806
In the meantime I studied its language
and read its Talman.

230
00:38:45,501 --> 00:38:47,366
Translate.

231
00:38:47,437 --> 00:38:56,835
"If one receives evil from another,
let one not do evil in return."

232
00:38:57,981 --> 00:39:09,654
"Rather, let him extend love to the enemy,
that love might unite them."

233
00:39:10,226 --> 00:39:14,993
I've heard all this before
in the human Talman.

234
00:39:15,465 --> 00:39:17,660
Of course you have.

235
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:20,462
Truth is truth.

236
00:39:21,838 --> 00:39:28,402
But what you have not yet learned
is the way we Dracs express the truth.

237
00:39:30,246 --> 00:39:35,445
The words of Shizumaat must be sung.

238
00:40:34,210 --> 00:40:36,269
Let's go.

239
00:40:49,659 --> 00:40:51,559
Come on, Jerry. Move it.

240
00:40:55,665 --> 00:40:57,724
Come on.

241
00:41:05,174 --> 00:41:07,142
Get up, damn you.

242
00:41:14,083 --> 00:41:17,575
What do I have to do,
carry you, you lazy bastard?

243
00:41:17,687 --> 00:41:20,679
- I am sorry, Davidge.
- We live like animals.

244
00:41:20,757 --> 00:41:23,692
And you get so fat you can barely move.

245
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:29,528
- You'll never conquer the universe like that.
- We were here 1,000 years before you.

246
00:41:30,767 --> 00:41:36,069
Well, in case you haven't heard it, Dracface,
we legally annexed this star system.

247
00:41:36,139 --> 00:41:40,542
- You invaded this star system.
- Bullshit. You're the invaders.

248
00:41:40,610 --> 00:41:43,943
No, we are explorers.
We are founders of worlds.

249
00:41:45,815 --> 00:41:49,478
What do you think we are, Dracface?
Homebodies, huh?

250
00:41:49,552 --> 00:41:53,784
- We settled twice as many worlds as you.
- Exactly. You spread like a disease.

251
00:41:53,890 --> 00:41:59,351
- What the hell are you gonna do about it?
- You see what we do about it. We fight.

252
00:41:59,562 --> 00:42:03,225
Ha-ha. Some fighter you are.
You wouldn't last a week without me.

253
00:42:03,332 --> 00:42:07,769
- You lie. You owe your existence to me.
- We'll see about that.

254
00:42:10,606 --> 00:42:14,007
You get out of my shelter. 
Get out. Get out.

255
00:42:14,110 --> 00:42:16,374
You get out of my shelter, 
you son of a bitch.

256
00:42:17,780 --> 00:42:20,146
It's my shelter. I built it, OK?

257
00:42:25,154 --> 00:42:28,180
You son of a bitch.
I'll kill you, you bastard.

258
00:42:28,257 --> 00:42:30,452
I'll kill you.

259
00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:12,900
I think we're starting to go crazy.

260
00:43:17,306 --> 00:43:22,710
What we have to do,
we have to start movin'.

261
00:43:26,382 --> 00:43:29,215
You think we really are alone out here?

262
00:43:31,687 --> 00:43:35,817
Of course we are alone.

263
00:43:36,659 --> 00:43:38,718
I don't know.

264
00:43:42,265 --> 00:43:44,733
I had that dream again.

265
00:43:47,637 --> 00:43:50,333
There's this big ship in my dream.

266
00:43:53,109 --> 00:43:55,669
It's so loud, I wake up.

267
00:43:59,115 --> 00:44:01,606
But then I can still hear it.

268
00:44:02,652 --> 00:44:04,643
It was a dream.

269
00:44:05,121 --> 00:44:07,214
I don't know.

270
00:44:09,859 --> 00:44:11,918
Maybe.

271
00:44:14,864 --> 00:44:17,958
But I do know if we stay here, we die.

272
00:44:19,168 --> 00:44:22,137
Sooner or later we'll die.

273
00:44:24,707 --> 00:44:28,473
If this planet don't kill us,
we're gonna kill each other.

274
00:44:37,887 --> 00:44:39,946
You sure you won't come with me?

275
00:44:40,890 --> 00:44:43,586
No, Davidge.

276
00:44:44,961 --> 00:44:47,054
I stay here.

277
00:44:48,397 --> 00:44:51,525
I have no interest in your dreams.

278
00:44:56,772 --> 00:44:58,933
Any chance is better than no chance.

279
00:45:03,479 --> 00:45:06,971
Oh, come on, Jerry.
You're just being stubborn.

280
00:45:08,084 --> 00:45:13,317
No, I am notjust being stubborn.

281
00:45:19,996 --> 00:45:25,957
If I find help, I'll come back for you.

282
00:45:29,338 --> 00:45:31,602
And if you do not?

283
00:45:33,643 --> 00:45:36,134
Then I guess we both die.

284
00:45:39,548 --> 00:45:41,607
Alone.

285
00:45:45,821 --> 00:45:48,153
I'll see you later.

286
00:48:13,602 --> 00:48:15,900
Hello.

287
00:48:16,572 --> 00:48:18,472
Anybody?

288
00:48:40,196 --> 00:48:42,289
They're core samples.

289
00:48:43,632 --> 00:48:45,725
They're core samples.

290
00:49:16,866 --> 00:49:18,959
Scavengers.

291
00:49:29,290 --> 00:49:32,851
What I'd been hearing at night
was the scavenger ship.

292
00:49:32,961 --> 00:49:36,988
The scavengers were
human all right. Barely human.

293
00:49:37,832 --> 00:49:42,064
They were outlaw miners
who raped whole planets for precious ores.

294
00:49:42,170 --> 00:49:46,436
They hunted Dracs for slave labor,
so we tolerated them.

295
00:49:46,574 --> 00:49:49,065
I could only hope they'd found nothing.

296
00:49:50,011 --> 00:49:53,037
I had no idea what I was gonna say to Jerry.

297
00:50:14,135 --> 00:50:18,128
How cold do you think it's going to get?

298
00:50:18,940 --> 00:50:21,033
I don't know.

299
00:50:21,610 --> 00:50:23,519
I guess we'll find out.
