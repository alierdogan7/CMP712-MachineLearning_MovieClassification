He had manners.

He didn't tell you where
he was moving, did he?

30
00:07:03,549 --> 00:07:05,676
He owed some rent, honey.

31
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:11,181
I told him he could wait to pay
me till he got back on his feet.

He wasn't in
an accident, was he?

Oh no, he lost his job
with the oil tool company.

he left this box.

he could make up his back rent.

No. Nobody ships out if they're
in arrears, you know that.

NATASHA:
So, what's your name?

179
00:20:04,746 --> 00:20:07,332
Chance Boudreaux.
What's your name?

180
00:20:07,665 --> 00:20:09,167
It's Nat.

181
00:20:10,543 --> 00:20:11,628
Nat?

182
00:20:12,462 --> 00:20:15,423
Your parents name you
for a bug?

183
00:20:16,549 --> 00:20:19,302
No, actually,
it's short for Natasha.

184
00:20:19,385 --> 00:20:20,803
Natasha.

185
00:20:21,304 --> 00:20:23,640
What kind of a name is Chance?

186
00:20:24,682 --> 00:20:26,851
Well, my mama took one.

187
00:20:31,022 --> 00:20:32,941
So, how did you lose your papa?

188
00:20:34,442 --> 00:20:38,321
My parents, they got divorced
when I was seven and my father...

189
00:20:38,821 --> 00:20:40,740
Well, he moved away.

190
00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:48,206
NATASHA: We started to write and he
even called me a couple of times.

191
00:20:48,289 --> 00:20:51,209

here who can help us.

193

of hot sauce on ya, do ya?

195
00:21:14,565 --> 00:21:17,110
Elijah. What's happening?

196
00:21:17,193 --> 00:21:18,861
Wednesday meat loaf.

197
00:21:18,945 --> 00:21:21,572
I mean, they said
it was meat loaf.

198
00:21:21,656 --> 00:21:23,074
I thought you were
gonna get a ship.

199
00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:25,201
I lost my boarding pass.

200

201
00:21:30,999 --> 00:21:32,292

202
00:21:32,375 --> 00:21:33,459
We met yesterday.

203
00:21:33,543 --> 00:21:34,961
Have you seen my father?

204
00:21:35,044 --> 00:21:36,212
I saw the next best thing.

205
00:21:37,088 --> 00:21:41,384
<i>I was at Plaza D'ltalia yesterday, and
I saw this sleeping bag in a cart.</i>

206
00:21:42,385 --> 00:21:46,639
<i>It was a tiger stripe, like the kind
they used to issue to recon guys.</i>

207
00:21:46,889 --> 00:21:49,225
<i>Your daddy had one
just like it.</i>

208
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:52,979
Thanks, Charlie.
You bet.

209
00:22:50,578 --> 00:22:53,122
Don't be offended.
He passed them out for money.

210
00:22:53,998 --> 00:22:56,209

I thought you was
gonna catch a ship.

216
00:23:18,773 --> 00:23:21,526
Maybe I'll stick around
to run for mayor.

217

We're looking for someone
who worked for you.

218
00:23:23,361 --> 00:23:25,154
The man's name
is Douglas Binder.

219
00:23:27,115 --> 00:23:28,366
I never heard of him.

220
00:23:28,449 --> 00:23:29,826
I think he knew you.

221
00:23:29,909 --> 00:23:31,202
Did he work for you, sir?

222
00:23:31,285 --> 00:23:32,912
Maybe he did, maybe he didn't.

223
00:23:33,496 --> 00:23:35,665

he's not too good with faces.

226
00:23:54,684 --> 00:23:55,977
Right?

00:23:58,688 --> 00:24:02,316

I didn't know you had company.

228
00:24:16,372 --> 00:24:18,374
We were just leaving.

we should go back up there.

Not together.

231
00:24:27,091 --> 00:24:29,927
Poe knows something about
my father, obviously.

232
00:24:30,011 --> 00:24:32,263
Look, if you don't want to go back
up there, I'll just go back myself.

233
00:24:32,346 --> 00:24:36,559
Hey. If you want to find your daddy,
you're gonna have to work smarter,

234
00:24:36,642 --> 00:24:38,186
not harder.

235
00:24:39,395 --> 00:24:40,563
Yeah.

00:24:45,818 --> 00:24:48,446
Natasha Binder?
What's the problem?

237
00:24:48,529 --> 00:24:50,990
Miss Binder, I'm afraid
I have some bad news.

238

How did it happen?

00:25:25,191 --> 00:25:29,529
There was a fire last night in an
abandoned building in the Ninth Ward.

242
00:25:30,446 --> 00:25:34,534
The fire department discovered your
father's body in one of the rooms.

243
00:25:34,617 --> 00:25:35,993
I need to see him.

244
00:25:36,077 --> 00:25:38,996
Your daddy was burned
pretty badly.

245

had to be made from

father's service record.
