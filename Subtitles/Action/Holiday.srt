26
00:03:57,299 --> 00:03:58,803
Taxi!

27
00:04:00,570 --> 00:04:01,241
Can I have some water, mom?

28
00:04:01,504 --> 00:04:02,711
Try this biscuit.

29
00:04:03,706 --> 00:04:04,777
Here.

30
00:04:09,045 --> 00:04:09,956
Mom?

31
00:04:12,649 --> 00:04:13,924
When is the training going to come?

32
00:04:13,983 --> 00:04:15,043
It's due.
It will be here soon.

33
00:04:15,069 --> 00:04:15,658
- Give it to me.

34
00:04:15,685 --> 00:04:18,966
Go and ask its correct arrival time.

35
00:04:19,022 --> 00:04:22,006
To know the correct time, wait for the train.

36
00:04:22,092 --> 00:04:23,509
It will be here soon.

37
00:04:23,535 --> 00:04:25,830
- At least find out where it is!

38
00:04:25,863 --> 00:04:27,633
Where has it reached!

39
00:04:27,659 --> 00:04:28,838
Call him up!

40
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:30,612
It will be here soon..

41
00:04:46,917 --> 00:04:47,623
Hello?

42
00:04:47,785 --> 00:04:49,289
Hi, this is Virat's sister.

43
00:04:49,587 --> 00:04:50,897
Yes.
- Where has the train reached?

44
00:04:50,955 --> 00:04:54,167
Actually the train has stalled due to some problem with the engine.

45
00:04:54,625 --> 00:04:55,765
Is my brother close-by?

46
00:04:55,894 --> 00:04:56,930
Virat..

47
00:04:58,730 --> 00:04:59,709
Yes, he is playing.

48
00:04:59,798 --> 00:05:01,064
Virat! Virat!

49
00:05:01,090 --> 00:05:01,771
Virat!

50
00:05:01,966 --> 00:05:04,141
Virat! Virat! Virat!

51
00:05:04,636 --> 00:05:06,049
Virat! Virat!

52
00:05:06,075 --> 00:05:06,836
Virat!

53
00:05:07,205 --> 00:05:09,950
Virat! Virat! Virat!

54
00:05:10,108 --> 00:05:11,748
Yeah!

55
00:05:11,876 --> 00:05:13,083
Come on, Virat!

56
00:05:13,745 --> 00:05:14,952
Come on!

57
00:05:15,079 --> 00:05:16,908
Virat! Virat!

58
00:05:16,934 --> 00:05:17,917
Virat!

59
00:05:22,787 --> 00:05:24,769
Yes!
- Yeah!

60
00:05:25,090 --> 00:05:28,233
Virat! Virat! Virat!

61
00:05:30,662 --> 00:05:32,234
Yes!

62
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:36,579
Shit! Viral!

63
00:05:36,902 --> 00:05:39,248
Yes!
- Come on, you can do it!

64
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,320
Yeah!

65
00:05:47,613 --> 00:05:49,059
Yes!

66
00:05:50,983 --> 00:05:52,692
Yes!

67
00:05:52,752 --> 00:05:55,965
Virat! Virat! Virat!

68
00:05:56,022 --> 00:05:56,967
Yeah!

69
00:05:57,823 --> 00:05:58,768
Yes!

70
00:06:01,928 --> 00:06:03,910
Come on, Virat! Come on!

71
00:06:04,564 --> 00:06:07,674
Virat! Virat! Virat!

72
00:06:08,234 --> 00:06:09,874
Come on, champion!

73
00:06:13,173 --> 00:06:16,157
Where did sir come from?

74
00:06:17,143 --> 00:06:17,861
Virat! Come on!

75
00:06:17,887 --> 00:06:18,843
- Look behind you!

76
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:19,858
Come on!
- Look behind you!

77
00:06:19,913 --> 00:06:21,018
Go on!

78
00:06:21,181 --> 00:06:22,719
Look behind you!
- What happened?

79
00:06:29,523 --> 00:06:32,029
Captain Virat IC58664 reporting sir!

80
00:06:32,726 --> 00:06:33,968
Damn!

81
00:06:38,199 --> 00:06:39,645
Oh God!

82
00:06:44,105 --> 00:06:45,141
Sorry, sir.

83
00:06:45,206 --> 00:06:47,621
I didn't know I was standing on muck.

84
00:06:47,675 --> 00:06:49,178
Let me wipe it off.

85
00:06:49,944 --> 00:06:51,219
Good block, sir.

86
00:06:51,713 --> 00:06:52,624
Sir..

87
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:55,689
The muck.. I, sir..

88
00:06:56,318 --> 00:06:57,821
Sir, the train is signalling us.

89
00:06:57,985 --> 00:07:00,798
Sir, you can clean this up in its bathroom.

90
00:07:00,855 --> 00:07:02,530
Let's go, sir.
Let's go!

91
00:07:02,590 --> 00:07:03,642
Let's go!
 Hurry up!

92
00:07:03,668 --> 00:07:04,221
Let's go!

93
00:07:04,259 --> 00:07:06,207
Hurry up! Let's go!

94
00:07:14,803 --> 00:07:16,283
'Your attention please.'

95
00:07:16,538 --> 00:07:21,014
'Jammu to Mumbai, Soldier Holiday Special Express..'

96
00:07:21,076 --> 00:07:24,083
It's here!
- 'Train No. 12472..

97
00:07:24,146 --> 00:07:26,959
...Is arriving on Platform No. 5.'

98
00:07:27,015 --> 00:07:28,257
'Thank you.'

99
00:07:36,559 --> 00:07:38,802
Brother.. Brother..

100
00:07:39,095 --> 00:07:41,600
Everyone's here except Virat.

101
00:07:41,664 --> 00:07:42,376
Where is he?

102
00:07:42,402 --> 00:07:44,002
- There he is! Look, mom!

103
00:07:44,033 --> 00:07:45,981
Brother! Hi, brother!
- Virat!

104
00:07:49,973 --> 00:07:52,114
Brother! Let's go!
- Let's go!

105
00:07:54,277 --> 00:07:54,837
How are you?

106
00:07:54,863 --> 00:07:56,215
- I am fine. How about you?

107
00:07:56,279 --> 00:07:57,760
Virat!
- Dad!

108
00:07:58,281 --> 00:07:59,090
Hello!

109
00:07:59,148 --> 00:08:00,636
Dad, they are my friends.

110
00:08:00,662 --> 00:08:01,554
He's Vishal..

111
00:08:01,585 --> 00:08:03,122
Virat, we don't have time.
Let's go.

112
00:08:03,187 --> 00:08:04,223
Yes, let's go.
- But my friends..

113
00:08:04,488 --> 00:08:05,797
We are in a hum.
- Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!

114
00:08:05,855 --> 00:08:07,564
Listen to me..
- Where are you taking him?

115
00:08:07,624 --> 00:08:08,865
I'll see you guys later!
- Hurry up!

116
00:08:08,925 --> 00:08:10,634
I'll talk to you later.
- Call me.

117
00:08:10,694 --> 00:08:11,970
Where are we going, dad?

118
00:08:12,062 --> 00:08:14,066
Yes. Bye.
- First let's get out of here.

119
00:08:14,098 --> 00:08:15,875
Let's go.
- But what's the hum]?

120
00:08:15,933 --> 00:08:16,954
Just come with us.

121
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:18,908
Get inside. Get inside the taxi.

122
00:08:18,936 --> 00:08:20,245
Let's go.
- Keep the bags there.

123
00:08:20,504 --> 00:08:21,985
Yes, over here.
- Get in.

124
00:08:22,039 --> 00:08:23,212
Come on.

125
00:08:28,278 --> 00:08:30,659
Hit the third gear, sir.

126
00:08:32,817 --> 00:08:33,990
What's the hum], dad?

127
00:08:34,016 --> 00:08:35,188
Where are we going?

128
00:08:35,219 --> 00:08:37,064
Don't you know?

129
00:08:37,087 --> 00:08:39,000
Otherwise, why would I be asking you?

130
00:08:39,023 --> 00:08:40,902
Shut up and listen.

131
00:08:40,991 --> 00:08:43,201
We are going to see a bride for you.

132
00:08:43,294 --> 00:08:46,278
The auspicious time ends in 23 minutes.

133
00:08:46,531 --> 00:08:49,310
After 5:00pm the alignment of the stars will change.

134
00:08:49,567 --> 00:08:51,606
And Shraddha period begins from tomorrow.

135
00:08:51,669 --> 00:08:54,312
No one will introduce their daughter to you after that.

136
00:08:54,572 --> 00:08:56,714
We need to see this girl before that.

137
00:08:56,775 --> 00:09:00,055
Otherwise, you idiot will always remain single.

138
00:09:00,712 --> 00:09:02,557
Mom, I'll go wearing my military outfit?

139
00:09:02,614 --> 00:09:03,491
So what?

140
00:09:03,549 --> 00:09:08,024
Let's go home, rest, eat, freshen up and then go.

141
00:09:08,254 --> 00:09:11,261
You are not getting any younger, son.

142
00:09:11,590 --> 00:09:13,731
A single day won't change my age.

143
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:16,170
Quiet, all of you.

144
00:09:16,228 --> 00:09:18,141
Sorry.
- Hit the fourth gear, sir.

145
00:09:18,197 --> 00:09:20,679
It's a taxi, and not an aeroplane, sir.

146
00:09:20,766 --> 00:09:22,179
We've reached.
- Your destination.

147
00:09:22,234 --> 00:09:23,771
They are here.

148
00:09:23,836 --> 00:09:24,838
Hi.
- Hello.

149
00:09:24,904 --> 00:09:26,680
Welcome.
- Welcome.

150
00:09:26,739 --> 00:09:28,242
Hi.
- Hello.

151
00:09:29,008 --> 00:09:30,044
Hello.

152
00:09:31,811 --> 00:09:33,086
Your son didn't come with you?

153
00:09:33,212 --> 00:09:34,852
He is my son.

154
00:09:36,282 --> 00:09:39,289
His clothes suggest he has just returned from a battlefield.

155
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:42,663
Let's go.
- This way.

156
00:09:42,722 --> 00:09:43,758
Let's go.

157
00:09:44,023 --> 00:09:45,902
This way.
Please come.

158
00:09:48,228 --> 00:09:50,039
Three wickets down at the door itself.

159
00:09:50,097 --> 00:09:51,941
Hi.
- Hello.

160
00:09:52,299 --> 00:09:53,301
Welcome.

161
00:09:53,566 --> 00:09:54,739
Jai Hind.

162
00:09:56,904 --> 00:09:57,632
Have a seat.

163
00:09:57,658 --> 00:09:58,933
Please have a seat.

164
00:10:01,809 --> 00:10:02,788
Oh.

165
00:10:03,276 --> 00:10:05,657
You are late.

166
00:10:05,846 --> 00:10:06,882
Look at this..

167
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:07,868
Couldn't help it.

168
00:10:07,894 --> 00:10:09,146
The train got delayed.

169
00:10:09,216 --> 00:10:10,881
Close the buttons at least.

170
00:10:10,907 --> 00:10:12,818
- We couldn't have driven it.

171
00:10:14,054 --> 00:10:15,763
Did you have any trouble finding out house?

172
00:10:15,823 --> 00:10:17,132
No, not at all.

173
00:10:19,059 --> 00:10:21,770
We needed to see the girl before the auspicious hour ends.

174
00:10:21,829 --> 00:10:24,779
That's why we brought him here directly from the station.

175
00:10:25,266 --> 00:10:26,337
Please Call her.

176
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:27,238
Yes, of course.

177
00:10:27,668 --> 00:10:28,647
Call her.

178
00:10:28,702 --> 00:10:29,681
Yes.

179
00:10:30,038 --> 00:10:31,017
Saiba.

180
00:10:33,574 --> 00:10:34,645
Saiba!

181
00:10:40,815 --> 00:10:41,886
Sister!

182
00:10:41,983 --> 00:10:43,054
She's Saiba?

183
00:10:46,855 --> 00:10:48,336
Oh, thank God.

184
00:11:21,824 --> 00:11:23,065
Thank you.

185
00:11:38,208 --> 00:11:39,985
Saiba sings well.

186
00:11:40,110 --> 00:11:41,921
What would you like to hear?

187
00:11:42,112 --> 00:11:43,752
Any nice song will do.

188
00:11:43,847 --> 00:11:44,986
Look at his clothes,

189
00:11:45,048 --> 00:11:46,996
<i>'Jana Gena Mane' sounds pefiem.</i>

190
00:12:22,119 --> 00:12:24,762
She's nice, isn't she?

191
00:12:25,056 --> 00:12:26,628
Do you have her phone number?

192
00:12:27,759 --> 00:12:28,738
“Her!" Already!

193
00:12:28,793 --> 00:12:32,073
0226276..
- Just a minute, mom.

194
00:12:32,129 --> 00:12:33,610
022..

195
00:12:33,865 --> 00:12:35,038
789.

196
00:12:37,001 --> 00:12:37,912
Hello?

197
00:12:38,136 --> 00:12:39,309
Hi, I am Virat.

198
00:12:39,671 --> 00:12:42,746
Silence!
That boy has called.

199
00:12:42,975 --> 00:12:44,182
Yes, son?

200
00:12:44,242 --> 00:12:46,987
Uncle, I wanted to say that your daughter is very beautiful.

201
00:12:47,045 --> 00:12:48,320
Oh!
- Beautiful.

202
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:52,191
But it seems that we have different tastes.

203
00:12:52,284 --> 00:12:55,234
I don't think we will make a good match.

204
00:12:55,954 --> 00:12:59,097
But I pray that you find someone better than me.

205
00:12:59,858 --> 00:13:00,997
Sorry for the trouble.

206
00:13:01,059 --> 00:13:02,904
Stupid! What's your problem!

207
00:13:02,961 --> 00:13:03,963
Forget it!

208
00:13:04,029 --> 00:13:05,738
I don't think he will never get married!

209
00:13:05,798 --> 00:13:07,063
Why didn't you like her!

210
00:13:07,089 --> 00:13:08,670
Give me at least one reason!

211
00:13:08,701 --> 00:13:10,205
Not one, I have three reasons.

212
00:13:10,236 --> 00:13:11,807
What? - What?
- What?

213
00:13:12,071 --> 00:13:13,642
She plait is a metre long and then some.

214
00:13:13,739 --> 00:13:15,550
That's not an excuse.
- So what?

215
00:13:15,608 --> 00:13:19,150
Girls with hair longer than 6 inches take 1V2 hours to get their hair done.

216
00:13:19,212 --> 00:13:21,718
In her case, she will take six hours!

217
00:13:21,781 --> 00:13:24,229
I'll have to wait the whole day to go for a party.

218
00:13:25,318 --> 00:13:26,663
Did I tell you?

219
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:28,663
Did I ask you to get me married?

220
00:13:28,722 --> 00:13:29,633
Did I?!

221
00:13:29,689 --> 00:13:30,794
Secondly..

222
00:13:30,990 --> 00:13:33,940
She is very shy and timid.

223
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:41,979
Saw that?

224
00:13:42,035 --> 00:13:44,017
She raised her hand on her father.

225
00:13:44,171 --> 00:13:46,016
You should have been strict from the beginning.

226
00:13:46,140 --> 00:13:48,247
“Hit papa! Hit papa!"

227
00:13:48,342 --> 00:13:50,153
You got her into this habit.

228
00:13:50,344 --> 00:13:51,722
And what's the third reason?

229
00:13:51,778 --> 00:13:54,694
And the third reason is that I want a stylish girl.

230
00:13:54,749 --> 00:13:56,252
An impressive girl.

231
00:13:56,316 --> 00:13:59,061
She looks like she has just come from a village.

232
00:14:07,061 --> 00:14:07,904
Hey!

233
00:14:08,729 --> 00:14:10,836
What.
What are you doing?

234
00:14:11,131 --> 00:14:12,042
Hey!

235
00:14:14,101 --> 00:14:16,049
Why do you need so much money?

236
00:14:16,104 --> 00:14:18,245
I served coffee to six people.

237
00:14:18,539 --> 00:14:19,883
This is a tip for that.

238
00:14:19,907 --> 00:14:21,855
Hey..
- Bye!

239
00:14:25,146 --> 00:14:26,991
According the post-modem report.

240
00:14:27,048 --> 00:14:29,895
This woman committed suicide by setting herself on fire.

241
00:14:29,951 --> 00:14:31,878
Impossible.
 This isn't a suicide.

242
00:14:31,904 --> 00:14:32,721
It's murder.

243
00:14:33,655 --> 00:14:36,935
Soles of who commit suicide by setting themselves on fire never burn.

244
00:14:36,992 --> 00:14:38,735
This..
- Her soles are burnt.

245
00:14:38,794 --> 00:14:40,833
Someone killed her, made her lie down..

246
00:14:40,896 --> 00:14:45,907
Pour an accelerant on her, started a fire and declared it as suicide.

247
00:14:46,001 --> 00:14:47,222
Your case is solved.

248
00:14:47,248 --> 00:14:48,771
Just find the murderer.

249
00:14:49,971 --> 00:14:51,680
You started already?

250
00:14:52,208 --> 00:14:53,950
When I came to know that you are coming..

251
00:14:54,010 --> 00:14:55,649
I thought of taking a leave and going to Madgaon.

252
00:14:55,677 --> 00:14:57,887
But my luck simply..

253
00:14:58,580 --> 00:14:59,925
My leave wasn't approved.

254
00:15:00,016 --> 00:15:01,692
Just say that I trouble you.

255
00:15:01,718 --> 00:15:03,993
Why are you beating around the bush?

256
00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:05,899
Oh really?
I should just say it?

257
00:15:06,055 --> 00:15:07,900
Virat, you take a holiday and come here even] year.

258
00:15:07,957 --> 00:15:08,902
Yes, I do.

259
00:15:08,958 --> 00:15:10,233
You spend your days with me.

260
00:15:10,292 --> 00:15:11,203
Yes, I do.

261
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:12,741
You meddle in my affairs.

262
00:15:12,795 --> 00:15:13,866
Yes, I do.

263
00:15:15,932 --> 00:15:18,609
Whenever I am about to get promoted to being an inspecton.

264
00:15:18,868 --> 00:15:22,045
You ruin my chances and I get stuck at being a sub-inspector.

265
00:15:22,104 --> 00:15:23,278
Listen..

266
00:15:23,606 --> 00:15:25,781
I'll no longer meddle in your affairs.

267
00:15:25,842 --> 00:15:28,052
Happy?
You won't face any problems.

268
00:15:29,212 --> 00:15:32,094
Just a minute.
Here.

269
00:15:33,283 --> 00:15:34,764
Solve it.

270
00:15:38,789 --> 00:15:39,928
What's happening?

271
00:15:39,957 --> 00:15:41,164
A sports tournament.

272
00:15:41,258 --> 00:15:43,035
We're providing security for it.

273
00:15:45,028 --> 00:15:46,634
Hi, Rocky!

274
00:15:48,198 --> 00:15:49,577
Hi, Rocky!

275
00:15:50,601 --> 00:15:51,945
Let's go.
Do you want to provide security?

276
00:15:52,002 --> 00:15:53,244
Do you want to hang out with him?

277
00:15:55,273 --> 00:15:56,719
Rocky is retiring tomorrow.

278
00:15:56,874 --> 00:15:58,878
Today is his last day on duty.

279
00:15:59,610 --> 00:16:00,783
He is very smart.

280
00:16:00,878 --> 00:16:03,760
A few days back there was an article on him in the Mumbai Mirror.

281
00:16:03,915 --> 00:16:05,554
What's wrong with his paw?

282
00:16:05,649 --> 00:16:07,893
He broke a bone during practice.

283
00:16:08,086 --> 00:16:10,831
Department doesn't need him because he has a broken bone.

284
00:16:11,022 --> 00:16:12,195
So they are retiring him.

285
00:16:13,658 --> 00:16:14,694
Strange, isn't it?

286
00:16:14,893 --> 00:16:18,572
You are looked after only till the time you are needed.

287
00:16:19,063 --> 00:16:20,976
From tomorrow he will be a street dog.

288
00:16:21,265 --> 00:16:24,215
Can I take Rocky with me tomorrow?

289
00:16:25,904 --> 00:16:27,249
Sure.

290
00:16:27,772 --> 00:16:29,981
Fine. I'll take him in.

291
00:16:30,709 --> 00:16:32,281
Fantastic.
- Bye, Rocky.

292
00:16:37,917 --> 00:16:39,727
Security is perfect?
- Yes, sir.

293
00:16:39,985 --> 00:16:42,558
Don't let anyone in without proper ID.
- Okay, sir.

294
00:16:48,293 --> 00:16:49,831
Mukund..
- Yes?

295
00:16:49,862 --> 00:16:51,639
There's a lot of beauty here.

296
00:16:51,697 --> 00:16:54,270
Control your emotions.
I'm on duty.

297
00:16:54,333 --> 00:16:55,814
Yes, sir.

298
00:16:56,001 --> 00:16:58,678
Not so seriously. Control.

299
00:17:02,808 --> 00:17:06,020
Beauty reminds me, we went to see a girl yesterday.

300
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:07,081
How was she?

301
00:17:08,014 --> 00:17:08,924
Don't ask.

302
00:17:08,982 --> 00:17:09,941
I got so bored!

303
00:17:09,967 --> 00:17:10,989
Just don't ask!

304
00:17:11,017 --> 00:17:14,092
Intercollegiate boxing championship is about to begin.

305
00:17:14,154 --> 00:17:19,074
We first call upon, Saiba Thapar from St. Xavier's college, Mumbai!

306
00:17:20,526 --> 00:17:23,773
She is very delicate.

307
00:17:23,830 --> 00:17:27,212
V9"! Shy type, you know..

308
00:17:49,156 --> 00:17:51,229
You know the rules. Box.

309
00:18:01,235 --> 00:18:03,878
Come on, Saiba. Don't give up!

310
00:18:03,938 --> 00:18:05,350
Come on, Saiba!

311
00:18:05,376 --> 00:18:07,540
Saiba, you can do it!

312
00:18:09,877 --> 00:18:12,018
You can do it, Saiba!
- Saiba!

313
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:13,219
Come on, Saiba!

314
00:18:13,281 --> 00:18:14,818
Better focus!

315
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:17,789
I don't like this girl at all!

316
00:18:23,025 --> 00:18:24,973
One, two..

317
00:18:25,928 --> 00:18:27,807
Three, four..

318
00:18:28,631 --> 00:18:30,977
Five, six..

319
00:18:31,634 --> 00:18:33,980
Seven, eight.

320
00:18:34,236 --> 00:18:36,240
Nine, ten!

321
00:18:36,905 --> 00:18:40,254
And the winner is, Saiba Thapar!

322
00:18:41,043 --> 00:18:42,922
You should marry someone like her.

323
00:18:42,978 --> 00:18:44,891
Saiba! Saiba! Saiba!

324
00:18:44,947 --> 00:18:48,160
Right?
- She is the girl I met that day.

325
00:19:02,599 --> 00:19:09,215
<i>“I like to wander, but I am not wayward."</i>

326
00:19:10,006 --> 00:19:17,228
<i>“I gave my head free rein, but I didn't let it spoil me."</i>

327
00:19:17,514 --> 00:19:24,200
<i>“Now I feel, without you, I can no longer survive.”</i>

328
00:19:25,155 --> 00:19:31,305
<i>“lf not you, there shall be no one else.”</i>

329
00:19:31,595 --> 00:19:35,012
<i>“Only you rule my thoughts.”</i>

330
00:19:35,065 --> 00:19:38,744
<i>“Only you bring me peace."</i>

331
00:19:38,803 --> 00:19:42,653
<i>“In this world filled with fake intoxication..”</i>

332
00:19:42,707 --> 00:19:46,284
<i>“Only you give me a high.”</i>

333
00:19:46,544 --> 00:19:50,017
<i>“Only you rule my thoughts.”</i>

334
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:53,793
<i>“Only you bring me peace."</i>

335
00:19:53,851 --> 00:19:57,667

<i>“Only you give me a high.”</i>

337
00:20:02,193 --> 00:20:04,197
<i>“Loving you has made me feel alive.”</i>

338
00:20:04,262 --> 00:20:05,937
<i>“I forget everything, after looking into your soul.”</i>

339
00:20:05,997 --> 00:20:08,947
<i>“This is what your love does to me."</i>

340
00:20:27,719 --> 00:20:31,261
<i>“Why you are the only one I desire?</i>

341
00:20:31,323 --> 00:20:34,934
<i>“Why can't I see anyone beyond you?”</i>

342
00:20:34,961 --> 00:20:38,879
<i>“I wonder what brought about these changes.”</i>

343
00:20:38,898 --> 00:20:42,075
<i>“I am crazy about you.”</i>

344
00:20:42,368 --> 00:20:46,115
<i>“Why have all the games changed?”</i>

345
00:20:46,172 --> 00:20:50,147
<i>“Why are all my desires limited to you?”</i>

346
00:20:50,209 --> 00:20:53,820
<i>“I wonder what brought about these changes.”</i>

347
00:20:53,846 --> 00:20:56,955
<i>“I am crazy about you.”</i>

348
00:20:57,016 --> 00:20:58,759

362
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:42,373
<i>“Only you give me a high.”</i>

363
00:21:53,174 --> 00:21:57,058
<i>“Only you are the one I have lost my head to."</i>

364
00:21:57,111 --> 00:22:00,722
<i>“Whatever I am, however I am, I am yours.”</i>

365
00:22:00,782 --> 00:22:04,563
<i>“I am the shore where your desires gather.”</i>

366
00:22:04,619 --> 00:22:08,035
<i>“How do I say this?”</i>

367
00:22:08,090 --> 00:22:11,870
<i>“Only for you, I've come down to this earth.”</i>

368
00:22:11,926 --> 00:22:15,639
<i>“I am the signal of your innocent eyes.”</i>

369
00:22:15,697 --> 00:22:19,308
<i>“I am the shore where your desires gather.”</i>

370
00:22:19,334 --> 00:22:22,751
<i>“How do I say this?”</i>

371
00:22:22,805 --> 00:22:24,251
<i>“You are close to me..”</i>

372
00:22:24,306 --> 00:22:26,015
<i>“Just a little.”</i>

373
00:22:26,075 --> 00:22:28,114
<i>“You are my thirst.”</i>

374
00:22:28,177 --> 00:22:30,090
<i>“Just a little.”</i>

375
00:22:30,179 --> 00:22:31,888
<i>“You are the one that suits me."</i>

376
00:22:31,947 --> 00:22:33,986
<i>“Just a little.”</i>

377
00:22:34,917 --> 00:22:37,764
<i>“Now I belong to you.”</i>

378
00:22:37,820 --> 00:22:41,328
<i>“Only you rule my thoughts.”</i>

379
00:22:41,591 --> 00:22:45,099
<i>“Only you bring me peace."</i>

380
00:22:45,161 --> 00:22:48,839

00:22:56,239 --> 00:22:59,952
<i>“Only you bring me peace."</i>

384
00:23:00,010 --> 00:23:03,757
<i>“In this world filled with fake intoxication..”</i>

385
00:23:03,814 --> 00:23:07,287
<i>“Only you give me a high.”</i>

386
00:23:08,719 --> 00:23:10,564
<i>“Loving you has made me feel alive.”</i>

387
00:23:10,621 --> 00:23:12,124
<i>“I forget everything, after looking into your soul.”</i>

388
00:23:12,189 --> 00:23:15,833
<i>“This is what your love does to me."</i>

389
00:23:18,129 --> 00:23:20,236
No! No! Absolutely not!

390
00:23:20,564 --> 00:23:22,877
Earlier you sought three faults in her.

391
00:23:22,967 --> 00:23:25,849
Now you feel that she is the moon.

392
00:23:25,903 --> 00:23:27,942
Mom, how will a phone call make any difference to you?

393
00:23:28,005 --> 00:23:29,680
Your son will get a chance to settle down.

394
00:23:29,741 --> 00:23:30,453
Try and understand.

395
00:23:30,479 --> 00:23:31,303
Just one phone call.

396
00:23:31,342 --> 00:23:32,687
Happy birthday, mom,

397
00:23:32,744 --> 00:23:34,817
I celebrated my birthday last month.

398
00:23:34,946 --> 00:23:36,586
And you are giving me a gift today!

399
00:23:36,648 --> 00:23:38,026
That too a dog!
- Please, mom.

400
00:23:38,082 --> 00:23:39,791
Consider it a belated birthday gift. Mom..

401
00:23:39,851 --> 00:23:41,024
Your pencil.

402
00:23:41,218 --> 00:23:43,997
Hey, make the phone call, please.

403
00:23:44,155 --> 00:23:45,693
Just one call for your brother.
- No.

404
00:23:45,757 --> 00:23:46,293
Please?

405
00:23:46,358 --> 00:23:48,066
See. Happy birthday-

406
00:23:50,595 --> 00:23:51,768
I hate dogs!

407
00:23:51,896 --> 00:23:53,138
Both of you, get out of here!

408
00:23:54,199 --> 00:23:56,044
Is this a joke?

409
00:23:56,168 --> 00:23:57,614
He didn't like me the other day.

410
00:23:57,669 --> 00:23:58,843
Now he likes me.

411
00:23:59,004 --> 00:24:01,282
Will it do if again after marriage he says he doesn't like me?

412
00:24:01,639 --> 00:24:05,216
Look, you got your first proposal when you were 13.

413
00:24:05,277 --> 00:24:08,159
I've been getting text messages since I was 10!

414
00:24:08,213 --> 00:24:10,628
Like you, I too have rejected many.

415
00:24:10,683 --> 00:24:14,726
You know, I used to get loads of text messages when I turned 18.

416
00:24:14,853 --> 00:24:19,101
Then as my age progressed the number of text messages declined.

417
00:24:19,192 --> 00:24:23,235
Now the only text messages I get are from customer care and call centres.

418
00:24:23,296 --> 00:24:27,680
Look, you should display some attitude but then you should give in.

419
00:24:27,733 --> 00:24:28,941
Got it?

420
00:24:29,035 --> 00:24:31,017
Anything you say won't make any difference to me.

421
00:24:31,037 --> 00:24:32,882
Oh God.

422
00:24:33,907 --> 00:24:36,823
You go to buy one article and you end up buying plenty.

423
00:24:36,876 --> 00:24:38,356
To go shopping with your wife..

424
00:24:38,612 --> 00:24:40,320
A person gets bored to death.

425
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:42,319
Please don't get married, Virat.

426
00:24:42,582 --> 00:24:43,789
I am telling you.

427
00:24:46,119 --> 00:24:47,361
Hey, this..

428
00:24:48,755 --> 00:24:49,791
Man] Kom..

429
00:24:49,956 --> 00:24:51,938
Isn't she the same boxer?

430
00:24:55,229 --> 00:24:56,732
Handsome.

431
00:24:56,796 --> 00:24:57,775
He's hot.

432
00:24:57,897 --> 00:24:59,105
Say hi to him.

433
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:00,839
He's the one I rejected.

434
00:25:08,976 --> 00:25:10,685
What are you doing?

435
00:25:10,745 --> 00:25:11,724
Look"

436
00:25:24,191 --> 00:25:25,297
Hey!

437
00:25:31,899 --> 00:25:33,676
I'll fall down!

438
00:25:44,079 --> 00:25:45,840
This is a police bike.

439
00:25:45,866 --> 00:25:46,986
I am on duty.

440
00:25:52,353 --> 00:25:53,834
Hey..
Get down!

441
00:25:53,889 --> 00:25:54,960
What happened?
- Get down!

442
00:25:55,023 --> 00:25:57,062
Okay. Okay. Okay!
- How dare he!

443
00:25:57,293 --> 00:25:58,329
Move aside!

444
00:25:58,594 --> 00:26:00,166
Hey!
Why did you kiss me?

445
00:26:00,629 --> 00:26:01,904
When did I kiss you?

446
00:26:01,963 --> 00:26:03,569
I kissed my mirror.

447
00:26:03,632 --> 00:26:04,668
This mirror belongs to me.

448
00:26:04,733 --> 00:26:06,146
I can do anything I want to do with it.

449
00:26:06,235 --> 00:26:08,274
The mirror might be yours but the face in it is mine!

450
00:26:08,537 --> 00:26:09,103
Just a minute.

451
00:26:09,129 --> 00:26:10,703
This mirror belongs to the government.

452
00:26:10,739 --> 00:26:11,913
Hey..
- Hey!

453
00:26:12,074 --> 00:26:14,022
I can do anything I want to do with this mirror.

454
00:26:14,043 --> 00:26:16,651
I can love it, kiss it or break it!

455
00:26:16,813 --> 00:26:17,887
Why just you?

456
00:26:17,913 --> 00:26:19,150
I'll break it!

457
00:26:19,182 --> 00:26:20,857
Just a minute, madam. No violence!

458
00:26:20,884 --> 00:26:21,693
This is a public road.

459
00:26:21,751 --> 00:26:23,231
So? He can kiss in the middle of the road?

460
00:26:23,285 --> 00:26:24,732
And you?
 You are a cop, right?

461
00:26:24,787 --> 00:26:26,131
Why are you standing here quietly like a fool?

462
00:26:26,188 --> 00:26:27,293
Let's go, Saiba.
- Look, ma'am, you..

463
00:26:27,557 --> 00:26:28,325
Let's go. Let's go.

464
00:26:28,352 --> 00:26:28,755
Let's go.

465
00:26:28,792 --> 00:26:29,999
Aren't you ashamed of eve-teasing?

466
00:26:30,059 --> 00:26:32,166
Let's go. Let's go.
- I'll break your jaw!

467
00:26:32,229 --> 00:26:34,268
Let's go.
- Ifl see you here again, I'll kill you!

468
00:26:34,331 --> 00:26:35,834
Let's go, girl! Let's go!

469
00:26:35,898 --> 00:26:37,573
Get inside.
- Keep moving. Keep moving.

470
00:26:37,634 --> 00:26:39,274
Keep moving. Come on!

471
00:26:39,336 --> 00:26:40,586
Ask for boxer Saiba!

472
00:26:40,612 --> 00:26:41,673
- Yes, we will.

473
00:26:41,705 --> 00:26:42,741
Then you will know who I am.

474
00:26:42,805 --> 00:26:44,845
Couldn't you have found a better place to romance?

475
00:26:50,748 --> 00:26:52,627
Move on, man!
- Hey!

476
00:26:52,716 --> 00:26:54,823
She has the keys to my bike!

477
00:26:54,852 --> 00:26:57,095
So what? Push it.
- Push..

478
00:26:58,255 --> 00:27:01,672
If only you wouldn't have rejected her..

479
00:27:01,692 --> 00:27:04,106
My bike won't have lost its mirror.

480
00:27:05,996 --> 00:27:07,705
Isn't she great, Makiya?

481
00:27:07,931 --> 00:27:12,578
She took the bike keys while talking to us and we didn't even realise.

482
00:27:12,670 --> 00:27:15,279
Not while talking, while verbally abusing us.

483
00:27:15,606 --> 00:27:19,752
Tell me what did my depanmenfs bike have to do with your quarrel?

484
00:27:21,179 --> 00:27:23,058
My purse! My purse!

485
00:27:23,114 --> 00:27:24,413
Has someone seen my purse?

486
00:27:24,439 --> 00:27:25,587
It contains Rs. 5000!

487
00:27:25,616 --> 00:27:26,288
Has someone seen my purse?

488
00:27:26,551 --> 00:27:27,292
Hey Romeo, something happening over there.

489
00:27:27,551 --> 00:27:28,544
Someone has stolen it.
I had it with me.

490
00:27:28,570 --> 00:27:29,114
- Come on, go ahead.

491
00:27:29,153 --> 00:27:30,155
My purse.. Where is my purse?

492
00:27:30,188 --> 00:27:31,931
It contained Rs. 5000 in it!
- Silence!

493
00:27:32,090 --> 00:27:32,548
My purse.. Please. Please.

494
00:27:32,574 --> 00:27:33,092
- You want your purse, right?

495
00:27:33,124 --> 00:27:34,126
Yes.
- You will get it.

496
00:27:34,192 --> 00:27:35,331
We are with the police.

497
00:27:35,594 --> 00:27:36,869
No one will move from their place.

498
00:27:36,928 --> 00:27:38,101
Stop the bus.

499
00:27:38,162 --> 00:27:39,333
Ask him to stop the bus.

500
00:27:39,359 --> 00:27:40,966
- I'll get down from the front.

501
00:27:41,333 --> 00:27:44,112
You will get your purse.
Come on. Come on.

502
00:27:44,236 --> 00:27:45,580
Come over here.

503
00:27:45,637 --> 00:27:46,810
Ask everyone to get down one by one.
- Okay.

504
00:27:46,871 --> 00:27:47,680
Hurry Up-

505
00:27:47,739 --> 00:27:49,084
Come on everyone, get off the bus, one by one.

506
00:27:49,141 --> 00:27:50,952
Everyone, get off the bus. Hurry up.
- Come on.

507
00:27:51,076 --> 00:27:53,024
Come on.
- Everyone, get off the bus one by one.

508
00:27:53,212 --> 00:27:54,123
This one?
- Come on, get down.

509
00:27:54,179 --> 00:27:55,625
Is this the one?
- No.

510
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:56,966
Come on, get down.

511
00:27:56,992 --> 00:27:58,348
- Leave. Come on.

512
00:27:58,685 --> 00:28:00,029
Do I look like a thief to you?

513
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:02,595
This one?
- No. - You can leave.

514
00:28:02,688 --> 00:28:03,251
Do one thing.

515
00:28:03,277 --> 00:28:04,922
Go inside and check under the seats.

516
00:28:04,957 --> 00:28:05,766
Yes, sir.
- Okay?

517
00:28:05,825 --> 00:28:07,134
Go and check if it is under the seat.

518
00:28:07,192 --> 00:28:08,263
Is this the one?

519
00:28:08,594 --> 00:28:09,733
Look"
- No.

520
00:28:09,996 --> 00:28:12,536
Come on!
Come on! Get off from the front!

521
00:28:14,967 --> 00:28:17,246
Open her bag.
- She? Open your purse.

522
00:28:17,270 --> 00:28:19,012
You will even check ladies purses?

523
00:28:19,072 --> 00:28:20,780
No, it's not there.

524
00:28:21,074 --> 00:28:22,611
Who's next?
- No. Not this one.

525
00:28:22,675 --> 00:28:24,281
Some of you get down from here.

526
00:28:25,278 --> 00:28:27,055
Yes, come on.
- Not this one.

527
00:28:27,113 --> 00:28:28,650
This one?

528
00:28:38,659 --> 00:28:39,968
Got it!
Got it! This is my purse!

529
00:28:40,027 --> 00:28:40,990

I got my pUTSe!

531

This is the one!

532
00:28:42,454 --> 00:28:43,827
- Virat, we found the purse!

533
00:28:44,631 --> 00:28:48,276
Hand him over to the police!
- Hit him!

534
00:28:49,203 --> 00:28:51,776
Virat! What's wrong, Virat?

535
00:28:54,742 --> 00:28:55,813
Virat!

536
00:29:09,757 --> 00:29:10,532
Hey you..

537
00:29:10,592 --> 00:29:11,936
Why.. why did you need to run?

538
00:29:11,993 --> 00:29:13,633
Why were you running?

539
00:29:13,695 --> 00:29:14,674
Why did you run?

540
00:29:15,530 --> 00:29:16,897
Why did you run?
 Yes?

541
00:29:16,923 --> 00:29:18,094
Why did you run?

542
00:29:18,567 --> 00:29:21,210
Why are you looking over there?

543
00:29:39,054 --> 00:29:40,056
Hey..

544
00:29:47,697 --> 00:29:49,041

565
00:30:58,169 --> 00:30:59,980
We gathered all the information.

566
00:31:00,037 --> 00:31:02,178
We knew that we would catch him one day.

567
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:04,984
Very soon I'll catch all the terrorists behind this attack.

568
00:31:05,075 --> 00:31:07,957
Don't worn].
Mumbai is safe as long as I am here.

569
00:31:08,179 --> 00:31:10,752
I have worked day and night and caught this terrorist.

570
00:31:10,815 --> 00:31:13,959
And it's assumed, their aim wasn't to blow up just one bus.

571
00:31:14,019 --> 00:31:15,830
They have a hidden agenda behind this.

572
00:31:15,888 --> 00:31:17,630
And we need to find that out.

573
00:31:18,356 --> 00:31:21,671
ViraL. Let's go and give an interview.

574
00:31:27,032 --> 00:31:28,604
Let's go.
- Let's go.

575
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:31,212
Not there. Let's go this way.

576
00:31:35,874 --> 00:31:38,015
'Sir, it's often seen that the Mumbai police..'

577
00:31:38,076 --> 00:31:40,719
'..has been unable to capture the terrorists behind the blasts.'

578
00:31:40,779 --> 00:31:41,758
'Even if they capture them.'

579
00:31:41,813 --> 00:31:44,957
Instead of questioning him, they are giving him VIP treatment.

580
00:31:45,017 --> 00:31:50,165
Let me assure you, I can die for the people of this country.

581
00:31:50,222 --> 00:31:52,865
He's blabbering as if he is the one who caught him.

582
00:31:54,193 --> 00:31:56,334
Actually, I should've been there.

583
00:31:57,697 --> 00:31:59,234
But you dragged and brought me here.

584
00:32:00,734 --> 00:32:05,882
Let me assure you, I won't rest in peace till this case isn't solved.

585
00:32:06,005 --> 00:32:08,284
If I would've been on TV..

586
00:32:08,342 --> 00:32:12,317
First of all, my mother-in-law would've been stunned.

587
00:32:14,247 --> 00:32:16,058
I would've gained a lot of respect.

588
00:32:17,985 --> 00:32:20,627
I would've become an inspector.

589
00:32:24,724 --> 00:32:26,866
Very soon the will be brought before the law.

590
00:32:54,789 --> 00:32:58,331
'Among those who died in the bus bomb blast included women and children.'

591
00:32:58,393 --> 00:33:02,642
'According to the police, the terrorist caught, Aseem Lala, is behind it.'

592
00:33:02,698 --> 00:33:07,584
'They also state that there can be other terrorist organisations behind it.'

593
00:33:07,636 --> 00:33:09,640
'But this has still not been confirmed.'

594
00:33:09,704 --> 00:33:14,088
'Police state that the terrorists behind it won't be spared.'

595
00:33:14,142 --> 00:33:18,186
'Home ministry has recommended formation of a high level investigation team.'

596
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:21,730
'And also assured that the security is being tighten up.'

597
00:33:21,783 --> 00:33:23,731
'Those behind these attacks.'

598
00:33:56,852 --> 00:33:58,697
Patil, I need someone at the back-street.

599
00:33:58,754 --> 00:33:59,756
Okay, sir.

600
00:33:59,855 --> 00:34:01,063
He is here.

601
00:34:05,161 --> 00:34:05,852
What is it?

602
00:34:05,878 --> 00:34:07,634
- We were waiting for you.

603
00:34:07,663 --> 00:34:08,803
Let's go.

604
00:34:12,035 --> 00:34:13,106
Come inside.

605
00:34:14,972 --> 00:34:16,920
This is Virat's house.

606
00:34:18,041 --> 00:34:20,820
Do as you have been briefed.

607
00:34:20,877 --> 00:34:21,822
Okay, sir.

608
00:34:22,112 --> 00:34:23,821
You are all on unofficial duty.

609
00:34:24,281 --> 00:34:27,025
Set your Walkies to a different channel.

610
00:34:27,083 --> 00:34:29,327
What is it, Makiya?
At this hour?

611
00:34:29,820 --> 00:34:32,099
They will be here tonight, for security.

612
00:34:33,157 --> 00:34:36,607
Do one thing. Take your family somewhere tomorrow morning.

613
00:34:36,660 --> 00:34:37,731
Just for a few days.

614
00:34:37,796 --> 00:34:39,367
Why? What happened?

615
00:34:40,364 --> 00:34:42,973
That terrorist escaped from the hospital.

616
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:44,272
What?

617
00:34:44,602 --> 00:34:45,273
Yes.

618
00:34:45,770 --> 00:34:48,686
He killed a doctor and two of my cops.

619
00:34:49,273 --> 00:34:50,618
But how?

620
00:34:50,675 --> 00:34:51,634
I don't know.

621
00:34:51,660 --> 00:34:53,946
In spite of so much security.

622
00:34:54,145 --> 00:34:55,717
You got him arrested.

623
00:34:55,780 --> 00:34:57,989
So he could come here and attack you.

624
00:34:58,383 --> 00:35:00,296
That's why they are here.

625
00:35:00,752 --> 00:35:02,734
Don't worny.
 Go to sleep.

626
00:35:03,255 --> 00:35:04,564
I'll make a move.

627
00:35:05,057 --> 00:35:07,061
Keep YOU!' eyes open, GUYS!

628
00:35:29,915 --> 00:35:31,190
Rocky..

629
00:36:17,832 --> 00:36:20,178
Yes, sir.
I have sent Tawde and Patil to Gate No. 2.

630
00:36:20,267 --> 00:36:23,741
I have never seen so much security being given by police.

631
00:36:26,908 --> 00:36:28,856
Hey!

632
00:36:30,711 --> 00:36:32,784
Hurry up!

633
00:36:35,016 --> 00:36:36,861
Catch him!

634
00:37:09,752 --> 00:37:11,096
He must have gone straight ahead.

635
00:37:11,153 --> 00:37:12,759
Sun/avanshi, where are you? Wait.

636
00:37:12,821 --> 00:37:14,200
I am coming.
- Okay, sir.

637
00:37:18,627 --> 00:37:20,768
Hurry up! Tambe, this way!

638
00:38:20,825 --> 00:38:23,809
What wrong did those innocent kids do to you?

639
00:38:43,181 --> 00:38:46,256
You know why did I sever your finger without first questioning you?

640
00:38:46,885 --> 00:38:48,958
Because now I am going to ask you a question.

641
00:38:49,588 --> 00:38:52,196
And if you don't answer me,

642
00:38:53,024 --> 00:38:55,234
you know the consequences.

643
00:38:58,097 --> 00:38:59,600
One question.

644
00:39:00,866 --> 00:39:02,211
One second.

645
00:39:03,835 --> 00:39:05,943
If you don't answer me..

646
00:39:07,773 --> 00:39:08,912
Another finger.

647
00:39:15,081 --> 00:39:18,726
Someone helped you escape from the hospital.

648
00:39:19,586 --> 00:39:21,123
Who was it?

649
00:39:21,888 --> 00:39:24,131
ACP Ashok Gaikwad.

650
00:39:29,696 --> 00:39:30,971
So simple.

651
00:39:45,312 --> 00:39:46,087
Who is it?

652
00:39:46,146 --> 00:39:47,125
It's me.

653
00:39:51,218 --> 00:39:52,756
What do you want at this hour of the night?

654
00:39:52,853 --> 00:39:54,596
Leave. We'll talk in the morning.

655
00:39:54,788 --> 00:39:56,022
I want to talk to you now.

656
00:39:56,048 --> 00:39:57,091
Come on the terrace.

657
00:39:57,124 --> 00:39:58,254
I told you to leave.

658
00:39:58,280 --> 00:39:59,860
We'll talk in the morning.

659
00:40:00,294 --> 00:40:01,068
Leave.

660
00:40:01,362 --> 00:40:03,935
Look, your friend's picture.

661
00:40:15,343 --> 00:40:19,386
The one you helped escape is a guest in my house.

662
00:40:21,816 --> 00:40:24,162
Sorry I didn't tell you who I am.

663
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:27,998
My name is Virat.

664
00:40:29,257 --> 00:40:30,829
Indian Army.

665
00:40:31,726 --> 00:40:33,035
Not just that.

666
00:40:33,795 --> 00:40:36,278
D.l.A.

667
00:40:37,399 --> 00:40:39,881
Defence Intelligence Agency.

668
00:40:40,135 --> 00:40:42,117
I am a specialist over there.

669
00:40:43,172 --> 00:40:45,120
A secret agent with the army.

670
00:40:46,909 --> 00:40:51,658
My friends who work with me don't know about this.

671
00:40:52,147 --> 00:40:54,425
Not even my family knows about this.

672
00:40:57,119 --> 00:40:59,294
Why am I telling you all this?

673
00:40:59,822 --> 00:41:01,997
I am sure this is what you are thinking about.

674
00:41:03,158 --> 00:41:06,905
It's because you won't live.

675
00:41:08,898 --> 00:41:10,971
When we are at the border..

676
00:41:11,367 --> 00:41:15,114
...our enemy shoots us and we shoot them.

677
00:41:15,638 --> 00:41:17,711
This is what generally happens.

678
00:41:20,310 --> 00:41:24,855
One day, in our camp, a man named Ashraf..

679
00:41:24,915 --> 00:41:26,692
He was from Sholapur.

680
00:41:27,751 --> 00:41:30,165
He just disappeared suddenly.

681
00:41:30,921 --> 00:41:34,167
Even after searching for seven days, we couldn't find him.

682
00:41:34,625 --> 00:41:36,037
We found him on the eighth day.

683
00:41:36,326 --> 00:41:38,274
He was stuck at the enemy camp.

684
00:41:39,363 --> 00:41:42,643
They tortured him for seven days.

685
00:41:43,334 --> 00:41:45,907
They had gouged out his eyes.

686
00:41:46,137 --> 00:41:50,055
They shoved a beer bottle into his rare.

687
00:41:50,207 --> 00:41:52,918
And then, they broke that bottle.

688
00:41:54,411 --> 00:41:56,222
They were very cruel to him.

689
00:41:57,214 --> 00:42:02,225
We had taken his dead body to his house.

690
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:05,124
His mother was crying

691
00:42:05,656 --> 00:42:07,899
and father was wailing.

692
00:42:08,292 --> 00:42:10,866
His sister was screaming, yelling..

693
00:42:12,163 --> 00:42:14,612
His family was in a very bad state.

694
00:42:15,633 --> 00:42:17,045
But on the tenth day,

695
00:42:17,369 --> 00:42:21,982
his younger brother joined the military.

696
00:42:24,042 --> 00:42:26,820
We die at the border even/day.

697
00:42:27,079 --> 00:42:29,687
...so that you can live peacefully with your families.

698
00:42:36,388 --> 00:42:39,896
This is a locally made gun.

699
00:42:44,196 --> 00:42:46,270
This is my gun.

700
00:42:52,037 --> 00:42:54,213
If I shoot you,

701
00:42:55,241 --> 00:42:59,091
I'll have to tell everyone why I did so.

702
00:42:59,345 --> 00:43:03,799
Your family will express their disgust over your dead body.

703
00:43:04,683 --> 00:43:07,326
Your kids will beg at the signal.

704
00:43:07,887 --> 00:43:11,862
Your wife will sell herself on the streets at night.

705
00:43:12,692 --> 00:43:19,206
And if you shoot yourself, it will be considered as on-duty suicide.

706
00:43:19,699 --> 00:43:23,047
Someone from your family will get a job.

707
00:43:23,136 --> 00:43:25,710
They will get the provident fund money.

708
00:43:25,905 --> 00:43:28,752
Pension will reach home every month, on time.

709
00:43:29,043 --> 00:43:34,088
Now you decide which gun do you wish to pick.

710
00:43:34,114 --> 00:43:35,093
And yes,

711
00:43:36,150 --> 00:43:41,298
if the barrel of this gun points towards me then I'll shoot you.

712
00:44:03,011 --> 00:44:05,927
You are challenging a very big threat.

713
00:44:11,152 --> 00:44:11,850
A shot was fired.

714
00:44:11,876 --> 00:44:13,352
- The sound came from the terrace.

715
00:44:13,587 --> 00:44:15,337
I think from over there.

716
00:44:15,363 --> 00:44:16,893
- From the terrace.

717
00:44:47,023 --> 00:44:51,704
I know that you and the ACP don't know everything.

718
00:47:24,251 --> 00:47:27,896
'Juhu. Bandra. Dharavi..'

719
00:47:27,989 --> 00:47:30,665
'Dadar. Bombay central.'

720
00:47:31,058 --> 00:47:33,700
'Blasts at 12 places in Mumbai.'

721
00:47:45,640 --> 00:47:46,619
When?

722
00:47:47,675 --> 00:47:48,984
On 27th.

723
00:47:49,143 --> 00:47:50,351
Time?

724
00:47:50,612 --> 00:47:52,719
4:00pm.

725
00:49:08,893 --> 00:49:09,984
Looking beautiful?

726
00:49:10,010 --> 00:49:11,161
- Very beautiful.

727
00:49:11,328 --> 00:49:13,139
Came from Jalandhar and made a Maharashtrian fall for her.

728
00:49:13,197 --> 00:49:14,906
Really!
- She is very smart!

729
00:49:16,801 --> 00:49:18,646
He is naive.

730
00:49:27,778 --> 00:49:29,087
You're looking gorgeous.

731
00:49:29,146 --> 00:49:31,025
Thank you so much. - Congratulations.

732
00:49:31,081 --> 00:49:33,360
Hi.
- Thank you so much.

733
00:49:34,018 --> 00:49:35,590
Thanks for coming.

734
00:49:35,653 --> 00:49:36,758
Listen..

735
00:49:36,954 --> 00:49:38,765
Listen!
- What?

736
00:49:39,057 --> 00:49:40,088
Come with me.

737
00:49:40,114 --> 00:49:41,223
I have doubt.

738
00:49:41,960 --> 00:49:43,065
Doubt?

739
00:49:43,294 --> 00:49:45,298
Do you think this is a mathematical class?

740
00:49:46,231 --> 00:49:47,061
Come with me.

741
00:49:47,087 --> 00:49:49,001
I need to ask you something.

742
00:49:49,334 --> 00:49:51,908
Please try to understand, I am getting married.

743
00:49:51,970 --> 00:49:53,075
After some time.

744
00:49:53,371 --> 00:49:56,321
Listen, my head will explode if you won't come with me.

745
00:49:56,374 --> 00:49:57,684
Come with me, now!

746
00:49:57,743 --> 00:50:01,023
Let's see.
I have plans but..

747
00:50:01,079 --> 00:50:02,058
Excuse me.

748
00:50:02,113 --> 00:50:04,152
Can you please hold this?
Let's go.

749
00:50:06,084 --> 00:50:07,622
Congratulations.

750
00:50:07,953 --> 00:50:08,989
What!

751
00:50:09,155 --> 00:50:12,264
The college beauty contest that I won..

752
00:50:12,324 --> 00:50:15,103
You lost but you were the second runner up.

753
00:50:15,627 --> 00:50:17,199
Okay. Continue.

754
00:50:17,263 --> 00:50:21,113
You have Hrithik, John and Salman's posters in your hostel room.

755
00:50:21,167 --> 00:50:22,340
So what?

756
00:50:23,869 --> 00:50:26,181
Then why are you getting married to this baldy?

757
00:50:26,238 --> 00:50:29,188
Look, there are no more than 10 film stars.

758
00:50:29,308 --> 00:50:32,315
But there are 30 crores girls in India.

759
00:50:32,679 --> 00:50:34,250
So think practically.

760
00:50:34,313 --> 00:50:37,024
The good looking guys aren't smart

761
00:50:37,082 --> 00:50:39,030
And the smart ones don't look good.

762
00:50:39,085 --> 00:50:40,361
Listen..

763
00:50:40,887 --> 00:50:44,168
And what about those who are smart and good looking?

764
00:50:44,224 --> 00:50:47,834
Beg, plead and get married to him.

765
00:50:48,328 --> 00:50:49,706
<i>30"'!-</i>

766
00:50:53,366 --> 00:50:54,745
Howzat!

767
00:50:57,304 --> 00:51:00,379
What's troubling you, Makiya?

768
00:51:01,341 --> 00:51:03,345
There's something that I cannot understand.

769
00:51:03,644 --> 00:51:06,252
Try me. I might be able to help.

770
00:51:07,815 --> 00:51:10,822
In spite of being a cop, I cannot understand.

771
00:51:11,652 --> 00:51:12,859
How will you understand?

772
00:51:12,920 --> 00:51:15,733
Why? I am a militan/ man.

773
00:51:16,124 --> 00:51:18,834
Do you know the basic difference between a cop and a military man?

774
00:51:18,892 --> 00:51:20,168
What?

775
00:51:20,761 --> 00:51:21,797
As soon as someone says “Attention!”..

776
00:51:21,895 --> 00:51:24,378
A military man stands stiff, like this.

777
00:51:24,899 --> 00:51:28,179
When he gets shoot orders, he starts firing without thinking.

778
00:51:28,236 --> 00:51:29,876
But it's not so with us.

779
00:51:29,938 --> 00:51:31,681
We need to use our brains.

780
00:51:31,739 --> 00:51:35,155
I mean if we need to catch a pickpocket, we need to think like one.

781
00:51:35,209 --> 00:51:38,193
If we need to catch a murderer, we need to think like one.

782
00:51:38,346 --> 00:51:39,325
And if we need to catch a terrorist.

783
00:51:39,380 --> 00:51:40,861
You need to think like one.

784
00:51:40,915 --> 00:51:42,988
No, you sometimes need to become a terrorist.

785
00:51:43,050 --> 00:51:43,791
Oh, my God.

786
00:51:43,852 --> 00:51:45,856
But in this case, even a cop's brain has stopped working.

787
00:51:45,954 --> 00:51:47,196
Then how can you help me?

788
00:51:47,256 --> 00:51:48,088
Still, try me.

789
00:51:48,114 --> 00:51:51,027
I'll try to solve this to be best of my ability.

790
00:51:51,059 --> 00:51:53,201
Tell me. What's the problem?

791
00:51:53,761 --> 00:51:54,365
Fine. It goes like this.

792
00:51:54,429 --> 00:51:55,431
The terrorist escaped from the hospital.

793
00:51:55,697 --> 00:51:56,199
He did.

794
00:51:56,265 --> 00:51:59,340
That very night a cop committed suicide in his house.

795
00:51:59,401 --> 00:52:03,946
That cop was posted at the hospital from where the terrorist escaped.

796
00:52:05,307 --> 00:52:09,783
Now these two incidents are related, this is what a cop thinks.

797
00:52:10,079 --> 00:52:12,357
Now tell me what a military man thinks.

798
00:52:13,048 --> 00:52:17,661
I think this isn't a suicide, it's a murder.

799
00:52:18,821 --> 00:52:19,994
How can you say that?

800
00:52:20,055 --> 00:52:21,832
Because I committed this murder.

801
00:52:24,794 --> 00:52:25,865
Why did you do it?

802
00:52:26,029 --> 00:52:28,409
Why did he help that terrorist escape from the hospital?

803
00:52:28,664 --> 00:52:30,805
Escape from the hospital.

804
00:52:31,301 --> 00:52:32,303
How do you know that?

805
00:52:32,368 --> 00:52:33,940
The terrorist told me.

806
00:52:36,139 --> 00:52:37,312
Where did you find the terrorist?

807
00:52:37,373 --> 00:52:39,286
That day in the hospital, you..

808
00:52:40,043 --> 00:52:40,988
What?

809
00:52:43,079 --> 00:52:44,388
hospital.

810
00:52:45,214 --> 00:52:45,989
Hey!

811
00:52:46,082 --> 00:52:46,754
Hi.

812
00:52:46,817 --> 00:52:47,990
What are you..
- Hi.

813
00:52:52,122 --> 00:52:52,897
Can we talk...?

814
00:52:53,690 --> 00:52:54,396
You don't..

815
00:53:02,732 --> 00:53:03,711
Yes?

816
00:53:05,870 --> 00:53:07,248
Can I marry you?

817
00:53:07,271 --> 00:53:08,615
Marriage?

818
00:53:09,606 --> 00:53:10,916
When did you get that idea?

819
00:53:10,975 --> 00:53:12,650
This morning. 8:40am.

820
00:53:12,777 --> 00:53:14,086
What happened at 8:40am?

821
00:53:14,178 --> 00:53:15,625
My friend got married.

822
00:53:15,680 --> 00:53:17,889
The most beautiful girl in the college.

823
00:53:17,949 --> 00:53:20,990
But the guy she is getting married to is not at all good looking.

824
00:53:21,085 --> 00:53:23,260
So, I asked her, why is she getting married to him?

825
00:53:23,355 --> 00:53:26,931
She said sometimes some things don't match.

826
00:53:27,325 --> 00:53:30,775
And you know how difficult it is to find a good guy these days.

827
00:53:31,829 --> 00:53:33,310
So my friends too advised me..

828
00:53:33,365 --> 00:53:36,212
And I thought that why won't we get married!

829
00:53:36,401 --> 00:53:38,644
I hope you very well know that from the very beginning..

830
00:53:38,703 --> 00:53:41,152
...nothing seems to match between you and me.

831
00:53:41,773 --> 00:53:45,315
First I rejected you then you rejected me.

832
00:53:45,410 --> 00:53:46,670
Now you are giving your consent.

833
00:53:46,696 --> 00:53:47,679
- I am just saying yes.

834
00:53:47,713 --> 00:53:49,820
Yes, but nothing matches. Right?

835
00:53:50,716 --> 00:53:52,060
Do you smoke cigarettes?

836
00:53:52,918 --> 00:53:54,262
Smoking?

837
00:53:54,352 --> 00:53:56,129
Yuck, I don't do all that.

838
00:53:56,321 --> 00:53:58,166
Anyway, it's not allowed in boxing.

839
00:53:58,190 --> 00:54:01,664
Saw? But I like girls who smoke.

840
00:54:02,294 --> 00:54:04,799
I like the fragrance of tobacco.

841
00:54:04,863 --> 00:54:06,674
Oh yes..

842
00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:09,273
It's not like I have never done it.

843
00:54:09,335 --> 00:54:12,251
Sometimes, you know, girls, parties..

844
00:54:12,338 --> 00:54:13,784
It happens.

845
00:54:13,973 --> 00:54:15,044
Nice. Nice.

846
00:54:15,107 --> 00:54:16,280
Do you drink?

847
00:54:16,608 --> 00:54:18,089
Drinks? Alcohol?

848
00:54:18,945 --> 00:54:20,654
Yes, red wine.

849
00:54:20,714 --> 00:54:23,094
You know, good for the head, good for the skin.

850
00:54:23,149 --> 00:54:25,222
Sometimes even vodka!

851
00:54:29,155 --> 00:54:31,194
But I hate girls who drink.

852
00:54:32,158 --> 00:54:36,339
I just cannot bear the sight of girls drinking.

853
00:54:36,663 --> 00:54:38,736
I can't understand why do they drink?

854
00:54:39,233 --> 00:54:40,804
Why are you crying?

855
00:54:42,269 --> 00:54:44,912
You are saying this on purpose.

856
00:54:44,972 --> 00:54:46,816
On purpose?
- I know that you love me.

857
00:54:46,907 --> 00:54:49,823
Saiba..
Saiba, listen to me. I...l..

858
00:54:49,877 --> 00:54:50,685
You..

859
00:54:50,745 --> 00:54:52,818
I came here straight from the wedding.

860
00:54:52,980 --> 00:54:55,725
I didn't even eat!
- I'll feed you.

861
00:54:55,816 --> 00:54:57,695
I am just joking!
- Joking?

862
00:54:57,752 --> 00:54:59,665
I am just joking, come on!

863
00:54:59,820 --> 00:55:02,359
If you don't believe me then let's go
to the temple outside and get married.

864
00:55:03,190 --> 00:55:06,140
But there's a problem.

865
00:55:07,295 --> 00:55:08,969
Now what's the problem?

866
00:55:09,129 --> 00:55:11,271
Because I was angry with you“.

867
00:55:11,332 --> 00:55:16,685
I said okay to the next boy my parents introduced me to.

868
00:55:17,738 --> 00:55:19,014
You said okay?

869
00:55:19,074 --> 00:55:23,390
Yes, it's not a big deal to say okay and then say not okay.

870
00:55:23,644 --> 00:55:25,820
But you said okay to him and then you said the same okay to me.

871
00:55:25,881 --> 00:55:28,261
No, no, no.
The okay I said to you is different.

872
00:55:28,349 --> 00:55:30,126
The okay I said to him is different.

873
00:55:30,185 --> 00:55:32,360
He too is a military man.

874
00:55:33,021 --> 00:55:34,057
A military man?

875
00:55:34,222 --> 00:55:38,231
If we somehow convince him not to go ahead with this marriage..

876
00:55:38,293 --> 00:55:39,399
Then our job will be done.

877
00:55:39,728 --> 00:55:42,006
He'll be at the coffee shop at 12 o'clock.

878
00:55:42,364 --> 00:55:44,106
Let's do one thing.

879
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:46,036
Let me accompany you.

880
00:55:46,101 --> 00:55:47,011
Let's meet him.

881
00:55:47,069 --> 00:55:48,242
You'll come with me?

882
00:55:51,740 --> 00:55:53,050
He is going to come over here?

883
00:55:53,242 --> 00:55:55,246
Yes. Please wait here.

884
00:55:55,311 --> 00:55:56,256
Okay.

885
00:56:00,650 --> 00:56:03,292
Stay here, I'll go inside and talk to him.

886
00:56:04,153 --> 00:56:05,030
You stay here.

887
00:56:05,056 --> 00:56:06,684
I'll go and talk to him.

888
00:56:06,723 --> 00:56:08,796
Come inside when I ask you to.

889
00:56:17,867 --> 00:56:19,109
Excuse me..

890
00:56:19,336 --> 00:56:20,932
Excuse me, the gentleman with the flower.

891
00:56:20,958 --> 00:56:21,750
Please turn around.

892
00:56:21,771 --> 00:56:22,250
Turn.

893
00:56:22,372 --> 00:56:23,351
Yeah?

894
00:56:25,841 --> 00:56:26,377
Sir!

895
00:56:28,111 --> 00:56:31,061
LC58664,
Captain Virat reporting, sir!

896
00:56:34,017 --> 00:56:34,792
Virat!

897
00:56:34,852 --> 00:56:36,059
What's going on?

898
00:56:36,219 --> 00:56:38,030
You gave such a salute to me

899
00:56:38,622 --> 00:56:40,831
that I felt as if I am on the parade ground.

900
00:56:40,858 --> 00:56:42,065
I am sorry, sir.

901
00:56:42,960 --> 00:56:48,780
The girl I am going to marry is coming here to meet me.

902
00:56:49,767 --> 00:56:52,148
I have never been married before.

903
00:56:52,303 --> 00:56:53,783
It's my first time.

904
00:56:53,837 --> 00:56:55,944
I am a little nervous.

905
00:57:00,979 --> 00:57:01,787
Hi...

906
00:57:07,185 --> 00:57:08,358
How are you?

907
00:57:08,787 --> 00:57:09,858
Stupid!

908
00:57:10,088 --> 00:57:11,067
<i>'.</i>

909
00:57:16,695 --> 00:57:18,141
How do I say it?

910
00:57:19,764 --> 00:57:20,607
Hi.

911
00:57:21,165 --> 00:57:22,271
Hi.

912
00:57:23,768 --> 00:57:26,217
Hi! Come, come, come.
Sit, sit, sit.

913
00:57:35,314 --> 00:57:38,925
You too like me, that's what your mother told me.

914
00:57:49,028 --> 00:57:50,133
Thank you.

915
00:57:51,063 --> 00:57:52,908
Sorry. Saiba, Virat.

916
00:57:53,165 --> 00:57:54,703
We are in the same battalion.

917
00:57:54,834 --> 00:57:55,939
He is very junior to me.

918
00:57:55,968 --> 00:57:56,970
Okay.

919
00:57:57,036 --> 00:57:59,883
He keeps on making mistakes and hence keeps getting punished.

920
00:57:59,939 --> 00:58:01,750
He is very scared of me.

921
00:58:02,075 --> 00:58:02,610
Virat..

922
00:58:02,675 --> 00:58:04,247
Sir! - Saiba.

923
00:58:04,877 --> 00:58:06,187
Hello, madam.

924
00:58:06,246 --> 00:58:07,248
Madam?

925
00:58:07,580 --> 00:58:10,359
I've kept a get-together at the hotel in the evening.

926
00:58:10,616 --> 00:58:12,359
A small party, you see.
- Oh.

927
00:58:13,586 --> 00:58:14,862
You must come.

928
00:58:15,656 --> 00:58:16,225
Yeah.

929
00:58:16,289 --> 00:58:18,158
Virat..
 - I'll be there, sir.

930
00:58:18,184 --> 00:58:18,957
Thank you.

931
00:58:19,092 --> 00:58:22,269
Now, it's 12:30pm.

932
00:58:22,663 --> 00:58:24,804
We were going to meet 12 o'clock.

933
00:58:25,799 --> 00:58:26,642
<i>30"'!-</i>

934
00:58:27,634 --> 00:58:28,399
I'm very punctual.

935
00:58:28,425 --> 00:58:29,698
I'm a military man, you see.

936
00:58:29,736 --> 00:58:30,875
Of course.

937
00:58:31,838 --> 00:58:34,047
So, we'll meet at the party in the evening?

938
00:58:34,208 --> 00:58:35,620
Yes.

939
00:58:37,678 --> 00:58:39,682
Virat..
- Yes, sir! IC58..

940
00:58:40,981 --> 00:58:42,766
Not in a public place.

941
00:58:42,792 --> 00:58:44,822
See you in the evening.

942
00:58:44,886 --> 00:58:45,922
Sorry, sir.

943
00:58:48,022 --> 00:58:49,195
Bye-bye.

944
00:58:49,256 --> 00:58:50,635
Bye.

945
00:58:56,197 --> 00:58:56,903
Virat!

946
00:58:56,997 --> 00:58:57,976
Sir!

947
00:58:58,098 --> 00:58:59,738
Is this how you were going to talk?

948
00:58:59,800 --> 00:59:04,345
Sorry, madam, but you are going to get married to him.

949
00:59:05,039 --> 00:59:07,352
He left. Why are you addressing me as madam?

950
00:59:07,675 --> 00:59:09,714
We love each other, don't we?

951
00:59:09,777 --> 00:59:11,759
We broke up.

952
00:59:11,813 --> 00:59:13,722
We started loving just an hour back.

953
00:59:13,748 --> 00:59:14,754
Already break up?

954
00:59:14,782 --> 00:59:17,790
Look madam, he is better than me in everything.

955
00:59:18,086 --> 00:59:19,725
Do you know?

956
00:59:19,988 --> 00:59:23,735
To complete a 400meter race I take 52 seconds.

957
00:59:23,792 --> 00:59:26,001
He takes 48 seconds.

958
00:59:26,629 --> 00:59:29,339
In high jump..
You know I can jump 6 feet high.

959
00:59:29,598 --> 00:59:31,910
He jumps 6 feet 4 inches high.

960
00:59:32,134 --> 00:59:34,845
In long jump, I hold a record of 7 meters.

961
00:59:34,903 --> 00:59:36,282
He has a record of 7.4.

962
00:59:36,339 --> 00:59:37,819
In weight lifting he..

963
00:59:37,973 --> 00:59:40,149
Am I selecting candidates for military?

964
00:59:40,209 --> 00:59:42,088
I don't like him.
 That's it.

965
00:59:42,178 --> 00:59:45,128
You didn't like me when we met for the first time, right?

966
00:59:45,248 --> 00:59:46,957
Then you started liking me, didn't you?

967
00:59:47,083 --> 00:59:49,759
You met him for the first time today, so you don't like him.

968
00:59:49,818 --> 00:59:51,926
You will like him in near future.

969
00:59:52,288 --> 00:59:54,065
That was different and this is different.

970
00:59:54,123 --> 00:59:57,403
He is my senior and I'll have to give this sacrifice.

971
00:59:57,660 --> 00:59:59,835
And I am the only thing you can sacrifice?

972
00:59:59,996 --> 01:00:01,408
Your phone's ringing.

973
01:00:01,765 --> 01:00:03,109
It's yours.

974
01:00:06,202 --> 01:00:07,376
Smart!

975
01:00:08,338 --> 01:00:09,112
Hello?

976
01:00:09,171 --> 01:00:13,682
Tell me, where did you meet that terrorist?

977
01:00:13,743 --> 01:00:15,052
I'll tell you that later.

978
01:00:15,679 --> 01:00:18,720
We need to do something important tomorrow. Okay?

979
01:00:19,316 --> 01:00:20,387
Hey, Vi..

980
01:00:21,919 --> 01:00:22,898

1001
01:00:35,733 --> 01:00:37,236
What are you doing over here?

1002
01:00:38,068 --> 01:00:40,141
Don't you know why I am here?

1003
01:00:41,739 --> 01:00:43,743
Don't ever come to my room unannounced.

1004
01:00:43,841 --> 01:00:46,415
There's something called as privacy.

1005
01:00:48,712 --> 01:00:52,186
Once again I ask you, where did you meet that terrorist?

1006
01:00:53,884 --> 01:00:54,795
Here.

1007
01:00:57,455 --> 01:00:58,457
Hey..

1008
01:01:00,125 --> 01:01:02,266
He ran away from the hospital.

1009
01:01:02,327 --> 01:01:03,865
How did you catch him?

1010
01:01:03,929 --> 01:01:05,740
You remember we went to the hospital?

1011
01:01:05,797 --> 01:01:08,302
Then you went to sleep, but I stayed back.

1012
01:01:08,366 --> 01:01:10,314
I knew he would do something.

1013
01:01:10,802 --> 01:01:12,180
Hey, but..

1014
01:01:12,804 --> 01:01:14,410
You cannot keep him like this.

1015
01:01:14,673 --> 01:01:16,051
You'll have to hand him over to the police.

1016
01:01:16,240 --> 01:01:18,051
So that he can once again run away?

1017
01:01:19,311 --> 01:01:22,921
No. But we'll find out how many people are working with him and..

1018
01:01:22,981 --> 01:01:24,223
Let that to me.

1019
01:01:24,283 --> 01:01:26,663
Why are you injecting him with this?

1020
01:01:27,786 --> 01:01:29,392
Say something.

1021
01:01:30,056 --> 01:01:32,129
Why are you untying him?

1022
01:01:35,862 --> 01:01:36,237
Virat!

1023
01:01:36,295 --> 01:01:38,676
What...?
What's going on?

1024
01:01:38,731 --> 01:01:40,735
You ask too many questions!

1025
01:01:40,800 --> 01:01:42,280
And you are answering none of them!

1026
01:01:42,334 --> 01:01:43,838
Will someone tell me what's happening here?

1027
01:01:43,903 --> 01:01:45,281
What have you injected him with?

1028
01:01:45,371 --> 01:01:47,718
Nothing.
It's just Ketamine.

1029
01:01:47,774 --> 01:01:49,778
He will remain unconscious for two hours.
 That's it.

1030
01:01:49,842 --> 01:01:51,015
And where are you going wearing this coat?

1031
01:01:51,076 --> 01:01:52,250
I'm going to attend a wedding.

1032
01:01:53,280 --> 01:01:54,282
<i>Wedding f?</i>

1033
01:01:54,947 --> 01:01:56,792
My batch-mate is getting married.

1034
01:01:56,949 --> 01:01:57,586
What will you do over here?

1035
01:01:57,612 --> 01:01:58,319
You are free, so come along.

1036
01:01:58,351 --> 01:01:59,456
Come with me.

1037
01:01:59,686 --> 01:02:00,472
You'll get free food.

1038
01:02:00,498 --> 01:02:01,021
Come with me.

1039
01:02:01,354 --> 01:02:02,960
But you have untied his hands and legs!

1040
01:02:02,990 --> 01:02:04,231
Let's go.
- ls everything alright?

1041
01:02:04,290 --> 01:02:05,862
Yes, man. What do I tell you!

1042
01:02:05,926 --> 01:02:07,124
How's everyone at home?

1043
01:02:07,150 --> 01:02:08,399
- Yes. Fine. All well.

1044
01:02:08,661 --> 01:02:09,531
Sister-in-law is fine too.

1045
01:02:09,557 --> 01:02:10,794
My son has started going to school.

1046
01:02:10,831 --> 01:02:11,742
Hi, guys.

1047
01:02:11,965 --> 01:02:12,841
Hi! 
- Virat is here.

1048
01:02:12,867 --> 01:02:14,268
- You are finally here, Virat.

1049
01:02:14,301 --> 01:02:16,249
Hurry up.
- You are always late.

1050
01:02:16,303 --> 01:02:17,974
We are getting late.

1051
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:18,834
Hurry up.

1052
01:02:19,006 --> 01:02:20,008
Everyone has been waiting for you.

1053
01:02:20,073 --> 01:02:21,052
Hi! Hi!

1054
01:02:23,043 --> 01:02:24,752
Let me first go meet uncle.

1055
01:02:24,811 --> 01:02:25,813
Hello, uncle.

1056
01:02:26,013 --> 01:02:27,187
Hello, aunty.

1057
01:02:28,282 --> 01:02:29,819
Hey, Virat!

1058
01:02:30,218 --> 01:02:32,233
You are looking very smart!

1059
01:02:32,259 --> 01:02:34,423
- Thank you.

1080
01:02:42,163 --> 01:02:43,535
What about your marriage?

1081
01:02:43,561 --> 01:02:45,263
I heard something went wrong.

1082
01:02:45,667 --> 01:02:47,238
Yes, there was confusion during our first meeting.

1083
01:02:47,301 --> 01:02:48,179
So we broke it off.

1084
01:02:48,205 --> 01:02:48,898
What do I say?

1085
01:02:50,872 --> 01:02:51,977
Who is he?

1086
01:02:52,040 --> 01:02:53,919
Oh, he.. I forgot.

1087
01:02:53,975 --> 01:02:55,284
He's my friend..

01:02:58,146 --> 01:02:59,786
Bandra East.

Sarah..

1094
01:03:06,821 --> 01:03:09,327
Will you take Joel as your wedding husband?

01:03:09,391 --> 01:03:10,929
Yes. With God's help.

1096
01:03:22,237 --> 01:03:22,731

01:03:22,757 --> 01:03:23,435
- Look at the time..

1098
01:03:23,673 --> 01:03:25,916
Guys, the bridegroom is calling you.

1099
01:03:26,008 --> 01:03:27,010
Come, guys.

1100
01:03:27,843 --> 01:03:28,379

01:03:32,380 --> 01:03:32,943
- Thanks, Virat.

1105
01:03:32,982 --> 01:03:34,657
Hi, Virat.
Hi, Siddhanh.

1106
01:03:34,717 --> 01:03:35,788

1108
01:03:36,436 --> 01:03:37,015

Thank you so much.

1110
01:03:43,159 --> 01:03:45,368
You will know once you go there?

1111
01:03:46,429 --> 01:03:48,035
What are you doing?

1112
01:03:48,097 --> 01:03:49,338
Alright, GUYS-

1113
01:03:50,033 --> 01:03:51,206
He's saying something.
- Listen. Listen.

1114
01:03:51,267 --> 01:03:52,372
Virat is saying something.

1115
01:03:52,803 --> 01:03:54,283
It's been a long time.

1116
01:03:54,805 --> 01:03:55,443
Let's play a game.

1117
01:03:55,469 --> 01:03:56,071
What do you say?

1118
01:03:56,106 --> 01:03:56,983
A game?

1119
01:03:57,040 --> 01:03:58,145
Come on, man!

1120
01:03:58,341 --> 01:04:01,291
He wants to play games in the camp, when the train stops.

1121
01:04:01,344 --> 01:04:03,623
And now even at a wedding, he wants to play a game.

1122
01:04:03,747 --> 01:04:04,886
This is a real game.

1123
01:04:04,948 --> 01:04:06,053
Real game?!

1124
01:04:06,883 --> 01:04:07,658
Yes.

1125
01:04:07,717 --> 01:04:10,360
Fine, then the six of us will be one team and you six be the other.

1126
01:04:10,387 --> 01:04:11,696
What do you say?

1127
01:04:11,722 --> 01:04:13,169
All of us are in one team.

1128
01:04:13,257 --> 01:04:14,293
All of us in one team?
- Yes.

1129
01:04:14,358 --> 01:04:15,667
There is no opponent?

1130
01:04:15,726 --> 01:04:16,831
But what are the rules?

1131
01:04:16,893 --> 01:04:18,101
I'll tell that later.

1132
01:04:18,162 --> 01:04:20,371
Fine. But after winning, you'll give all of us a party.

1133
01:04:20,631 --> 01:04:22,374
Yes. - Yes.
- You'll have to give a party.

1134
01:04:22,633 --> 01:04:23,635
Okay.

1135
01:04:25,235 --> 01:04:27,217
Okay, let's go.

1136
01:04:33,010 --> 01:04:34,821
Guys, pay attention.

1137
01:04:35,312 --> 01:04:37,089
This is a little serious game.

1138
01:04:37,349 --> 01:04:41,699
You will soon know who our opponents are.

1139
01:04:43,788 --> 01:04:45,235
Can you see my house?

1140
01:04:45,657 --> 01:04:46,728
Look at it very carefully.

1141
01:04:46,791 --> 01:04:50,299
In two minutes, a guy will come out from the backdoor.

1142
01:04:50,963 --> 01:04:52,911
The 12 of us will follow him.

1143
01:04:53,098 --> 01:04:53,975
Understood?
- Yes.

1144
01:04:54,032 --> 01:04:59,385
After that when he meets another person we team will get divided into two.

1145
01:04:59,938 --> 01:05:02,820
Six people will follow the guy who will just come outside.

1146
01:05:02,875 --> 01:05:06,018
And six people will follow the guy he meets.

1147
01:05:06,078 --> 01:05:10,964
As these people keep meeting different people,
our keep will keep getting divided.

1148
01:05:11,016 --> 01:05:12,691
Did you all understand?
- Yes.

1149
01:05:12,751 --> 01:05:13,753
Very good.

1150
01:05:13,819 --> 01:05:17,703
Remember, your cell phones should always be on.

1151
01:05:18,791 --> 01:05:20,898
Don't answer anyone's call except mine.

1152
01:05:21,060 --> 01:05:23,269
We 12 will have a conference call and stay connected.

1153
01:05:23,329 --> 01:05:24,901
Okay?
- Yes. - Okay.

1154
01:05:24,964 --> 01:05:26,808
Let's wait for the man now.

1155
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:28,241
He'll be here soon.

1156
01:05:41,147 --> 01:05:43,220
Is that him?
- That's the guy. Yeah.

1157
01:05:47,687 --> 01:05:49,862
This is very risky.

1158
01:05:50,657 --> 01:05:52,696
It will be more risky if we don't do anything.

1159
01:05:52,959 --> 01:05:55,033
Stan the car and follow him.

1160
01:06:08,776 --> 01:06:09,426
Where did he go?

1161
01:06:09,452 --> 01:06:10,304
- He was just here.

1162
01:06:12,112 --> 01:06:14,253
Where is he? We've lost him.

1163
01:06:14,314 --> 01:06:15,316
Where is he?
- There he is!

1164
01:06:15,349 --> 01:06:16,921
Over there. Over there.

1165
01:06:20,988 --> 01:06:22,093
Drive slowly.

1166
01:06:22,357 --> 01:06:23,735
He got into a rickshaw.

1167
01:06:23,791 --> 01:06:25,032
Vishal, note the number.

1168
01:06:25,693 --> 01:06:28,700
M I-I-O3-AA-6221 .

1169
01:06:41,810 --> 01:06:43,313
He's accomplice is here. Look..

1170
01:06:43,378 --> 01:06:44,916
Drive slowly.

1171
01:06:46,414 --> 01:06:49,193
What will we do if those 12 people don't split up?

1172
01:06:49,250 --> 01:06:52,200
They will have to, because they a job to finish at 12 places.

1173
01:06:53,389 --> 01:06:54,835
Stop the car.

1174
01:06:55,991 --> 01:06:57,836
Come on, boys.
- Come, come, come.

1175
01:07:12,742 --> 01:07:14,849
You all six.. Follow him.

1176
01:07:14,911 --> 01:07:16,289
Let's go. Move.

1177
01:07:19,915 --> 01:07:21,624
We are following him.

1178
01:07:22,985 --> 01:07:24,192
Keep following him.

1179
01:07:24,253 --> 01:07:25,289
Copy that.

1180
01:07:25,888 --> 01:07:27,163
Move. Move.

1181
01:07:31,661 --> 01:07:32,970
Stay on the line.

1182
01:07:36,733 --> 01:07:37,735
He's meeting another guy.

1183
01:07:37,800 --> 01:07:39,076
Stay alert Stay alert

1184
01:07:40,703 --> 01:07:41,911

Copy that.

01:07:51,882 --> 01:07:53,226
You follow him.

1188
01:07:54,184 --> 01:07:55,186
How many so far?

1189
01:07:55,252 --> 01:07:56,090
We are following the first guy.

1190
01:07:56,116 --> 01:07:57,088
- We are following the second guy.

1191
01:07:57,120 --> 01:07:57,997
We are following the new one.

1192
01:07:58,055 --> 01:07:59,262
Keep following.

1193
01:08:06,164 --> 01:08:08,043
He's walking right in front of me.

1194
01:08:08,366 --> 01:08:10,211
Stay alert
- Copy that.

1195
01:08:11,202 --> 01:08:13,879
Virat, we are following the first guy.

1196
01:08:15,672 --> 01:08:17,244
Another guy has joined.

1197
01:08:26,184 --> 01:08:27,323
Get in the train.

1198
01:08:29,988 --> 01:08:31,229
We are in the train.

1199
01:08:41,766 --> 01:08:43,304
Virat, they are splitting up.

1200
01:08:55,147 --> 01:08:56,422
Stay there.

1201
01:09:05,658 --> 01:09:06,865
Okay. Well done.

1202
01:09:07,192 --> 01:09:08,867
Virat, Goregaon Station.

1203
01:09:10,062 --> 01:09:11,668
Wait for the high point.

1204
01:09:12,365 --> 01:09:14,677
The first guy is meeting a cell phone dealer.

1205
01:09:17,270 --> 01:09:18,682
Now they are separate.

1206
01:09:18,939 --> 01:09:20,146
You follow him.

1207
01:09:23,343 --> 01:09:24,721
He's meeting another guy.

1208
01:09:24,778 --> 01:09:26,656
All of you split.
Split now!

1209
01:09:26,713 --> 01:09:28,125
They are splitting up.

1210
01:09:47,934 --> 01:09:48,815
You follow him.

1211
01:09:48,841 --> 01:09:49,838
Stay connected.

1212
01:09:49,870 --> 01:09:51,215
It's target at sight.

1213
01:10:00,114 --> 01:10:01,652
I'm following the new one.

1214
01:10:01,716 --> 01:10:03,025
There is one for each of us now.

1215
01:10:03,084 --> 01:10:04,120
Virat, I'm at Dockyard Road.

1216
01:10:04,218 --> 01:10:05,254
Masjid Bandar.

1217
01:10:05,319 --> 01:10:06,698
I'm getting into a fern].

1218
01:10:06,855 --> 01:10:08,199
I'm at Dharavi.

1219
01:10:09,023 --> 01:10:10,230
I'm at Matunga.

1220
01:10:11,759 --> 01:10:12,966
Virat, he has gotten into a bus.

1221
01:10:15,397 --> 01:10:17,242
He's getting inside a mall.
- Yes.

1222
01:10:18,132 --> 01:10:19,340
I'm right behind him.

1223
01:10:19,401 --> 01:10:20,278
I'm at Bandra.

1224
01:10:20,335 --> 01:10:21,110
I'm in a fern].

1225
01:10:21,170 --> 01:10:21,978
I'm at Chembur.

1226
01:10:22,036 --> 01:10:23,108
I'm at Kurla.

1227
01:10:23,205 --> 01:10:27,316
Guys, we are 12 people for those 12 guys.

1228
01:10:27,376 --> 01:10:28,982
The game is going to end now.

1229
01:10:29,044 --> 01:10:30,787
I have kept something in your bags.

1230
01:10:30,846 --> 01:10:32,053
Check it out.

1231
01:10:32,981 --> 01:10:33,756
It's a gun.

1232
01:10:33,816 --> 01:10:35,228
Hey, it contains a gun.

1233
01:10:35,284 --> 01:10:36,697
It contains a gun.

1234
01:10:36,819 --> 01:10:38,128
Virat, this is a gun.

1235
01:10:38,186 --> 01:10:40,099
No one needs to panic.

1236
01:10:40,355 --> 01:10:42,064
I have placed that gun there.

1237
01:10:42,324 --> 01:10:45,103
There's a bomb in the bag of the guy you are following.

1238
01:10:45,160 --> 01:10:47,199
He's not an ordinary guy.

1239
01:10:47,229 --> 01:10:50,806
He has killed innocent women and children in our country.

1240
01:10:50,866 --> 01:10:52,779
He's a damn terrorist.

1241
01:10:52,835 --> 01:10:55,079
We need to do what we do at the border.

1242
01:10:55,304 --> 01:10:57,843
To keep a bomb at four places at the same time..

1243
01:10:57,907 --> 01:10:59,718
To cause serial blasts in train..

1244
01:10:59,775 --> 01:11:01,883
We too know their technique.

1245
01:11:01,945 --> 01:11:03,152
We need to show them that.

1246
01:11:03,212 --> 01:11:05,752
There shouldn't be a difference of even a second.

1247
01:11:05,816 --> 01:11:07,957
Shoot them at the same time.

1248
01:11:08,117 --> 01:11:09,256
Ready, get set, boys.

1249
01:11:09,318 --> 01:11:10,297
Yes.

1250
01:11:10,353 --> 01:11:11,332
We will do it.

1251
01:11:11,387 --> 01:11:12,093
Yes.

1252
01:11:12,155 --> 01:11:13,328
We will do it.

1253
01:11:15,124 --> 01:11:16,399
Three..

1254
01:11:25,402 --> 01:11:26,882
Two..

1255
01:11:28,805 --> 01:11:29,784
One..

1256
01:11:30,374 --> 01:11:31,183
Shoot!

1257
01:11:52,963 --> 01:11:54,342
He's dead. I've left.

1258
01:12:04,309 --> 01:12:05,254
We'll do that.

1259
01:12:05,276 --> 01:12:06,415
When are you giving us party?
- I will. I will.

1260
01:12:06,644 --> 01:12:08,091
What have you done!
- Finished. End.

1261
01:12:12,918 --> 01:12:15,925
The dead body found at 11 places and the one found here..

1262
01:12:15,987 --> 01:12:17,365
They are sleeper cells.

1263
01:12:17,422 --> 01:12:20,304
They are even claimed to be terrorists.

1264
01:12:20,358 --> 01:12:22,397
They even found bombs in their bags.

1265
01:12:22,661 --> 01:12:23,332
According to the police..

1266
01:12:23,394 --> 01:12:27,278
All the cell phones found on sleeper cells are of high technology.

1267
01:12:27,333 --> 01:12:30,111
Looking at the magnitude of the preparations of these sleeper cells..

1268
01:12:30,168 --> 01:12:34,144
...one thing is for certain that Mumbai has been saved from a major disaster.

1269
01:12:34,773 --> 01:12:38,748
At the moment the biggest threat to this world are the sleeper cells.

1270
01:12:38,810 --> 01:12:39,687
What are they?

1271
01:12:39,713 --> 01:12:40,839
And who are they?

1272
01:12:40,912 --> 01:12:44,728
Look, in a terrorist world, these sleeper cells..

1273
01:12:44,750 --> 01:12:47,860
...are the one whose activities are most secretive.

1274
01:12:47,954 --> 01:12:53,375
Like the 12 men who were killed were kind of sleeper cells..

1275
01:12:53,459 --> 01:12:56,204
Yet they stayed among the common man..

1276
01:12:56,262 --> 01:12:58,836
...and prepared themselves for an attack.

1277
01:12:58,965 --> 01:13:01,208
The most important question.

1278
01:13:01,267 --> 01:13:04,718
Do these sleeper cells belong to a particular religion?

1279
01:13:04,771 --> 01:13:08,382
It's not always that they are related to religion.

1280
01:13:08,708 --> 01:13:13,059
When a country or a group want to plan a terrorist in our country“

1281
01:13:13,146 --> 01:13:21,232
They find people who hold a grudge, a feeling of revenge towards the government.

1282
01:13:21,288 --> 01:13:28,042
These people are found and prepared to execute a terrorist attack against us..

1283
01:13:28,095 --> 01:13:31,307
And seek their revenge.

1284
01:13:31,699 --> 01:13:38,316
After the 9/11 attack, all the secret agencies had one thing in mind..

1285
01:13:38,439 --> 01:13:41,912
That they should rid America of sleeper cells.

1286
01:13:42,042 --> 01:13:47,122
And they got rid of them in such a way that after the 9/11 attack..

1287
01:13:47,181 --> 01:13:52,967
...no attack of that kind or magnitude took place again in America.

1288
01:13:53,321 --> 01:13:56,863
Navin Chandra, Age: 29, killed in a BEST Bus.

1289
01:13:56,925 --> 01:14:00,968
Afsar Ali, Age: 31, killed at the Mumbai Central ST Stand.

1290
01:14:01,129 --> 01:14:02,940
Mother, look father!

1291
01:14:03,699 --> 01:14:04,370
Mother!

1292
01:14:04,800 --> 01:14:07,305
Mother! Look father!

1293
01:14:09,103 --> 01:14:11,416
Mother! Father's photo!

1294
01:14:12,707 --> 01:14:13,982
Mother! Look father!

1295
01:14:14,042 --> 01:14:16,150
Mother! Look father!

1296
01:14:16,411 --> 01:14:18,393
Look mother, father..

1297
01:14:29,424 --> 01:14:31,099
Who did this?

1298
01:14:31,827 --> 01:14:33,831
We still don't know who did it

1299
01:14:34,964 --> 01:14:37,037
Even the police have no clue.

1300
01:14:38,333 --> 01:14:39,439
Any clues?

1301
01:14:40,002 --> 01:14:42,713
Police has confiscated all their things.

1302
01:14:43,172 --> 01:14:47,250
Just one non-tracker phone has been taken by a shooter.

1303
01:14:50,213 --> 01:14:51,989
Whose phone was it?

1304
01:14:52,048 --> 01:14:56,330
Afsar Ali, who got killed at Mumbai Central, near the ST Stand.

1305
01:15:58,450 --> 01:16:01,400
I don't know who you are, where you are.

1306
01:16:02,887 --> 01:16:05,666
You have killed 12 of my men.

1307
01:16:05,858 --> 01:16:08,967
One of them was my brother.

1308
01:16:09,895 --> 01:16:11,808
I am coming to you.

1309
01:16:13,332 --> 01:16:16,977
When I find you, I'll kill you.

1310
01:16:19,271 --> 01:16:20,946
I am waiting.

1311
01:17:27,675 --> 01:17:29,850
Hello. Please come.

1312
01:18:45,522 --> 01:18:47,002
What's the height of this wall?

1313
01:18:47,057 --> 01:18:48,401
S ix feet.

1314
01:18:51,528 --> 01:18:53,669
They are excellent jumpers.

1315
01:18:56,967 --> 01:18:58,538
What was the speed of the bus?

1316
01:18:58,602 --> 01:19:00,744
Approximately 40km/hr.

1317
01:19:00,971 --> 01:19:02,816
They are good runners as well.

1318
01:19:06,443 --> 01:19:08,517
They can swim well too.

1319
01:19:10,781 --> 01:19:14,460
They have shot all the 12 people on their forehead.

1320
01:19:16,487 --> 01:19:20,735
A moving bus, crowded market, dark theatre..

1321
01:19:21,392 --> 01:19:25,401
Even from a distance of 20 meters they shot at the centre of the forehead.

1322
01:19:27,032 --> 01:19:28,535
They are trained shooters.

1323
01:19:31,002 --> 01:19:33,280
But they are not cops.

1324
01:19:35,006 --> 01:19:38,286
Was there anything common in these 12 people?

1325
01:19:38,877 --> 01:19:39,948
No.

1326
01:19:42,346 --> 01:19:44,454
But there was one thing common in them.

1327
01:19:44,516 --> 01:19:46,623
During enquin/ I found out

1328
01:19:46,818 --> 01:19:50,531
that these 12 people were wearing suits while shooting.

1329
01:19:52,291 --> 01:19:53,031
What did you just say?

1330
01:19:53,392 --> 01:19:56,899
These 12 people were wearing suits while shooting.

1331
01:19:57,964 --> 01:20:00,469
This is something you should have told me sooner.

1332
01:20:00,532 --> 01:20:02,811
I thought it's very common to wear suits.

1333
01:20:02,902 --> 01:20:09,086
It's very common to wear suits in America, but not in India.

1334
01:20:13,312 --> 01:20:16,695
So they are people who wear suit-pants.

1335
01:20:18,951 --> 01:20:21,628
They can be waiters in a hotel.

1336
01:20:22,522 --> 01:20:24,834
Businessmen attending a board meeting.

1337
01:20:26,626 --> 01:20:30,043
They can be software engineers attending a seminar.

1338
01:20:30,930 --> 01:20:34,883
Advocates, marriage functions.

1339
01:20:38,806 --> 01:20:41,653
I need a list of all the seminars..

1340
01:20:41,708 --> 01:20:44,885
...and marriage functions that took place in Mumbai on the 27th.

1341
01:20:45,679 --> 01:20:48,959
The ones with dress code suit-pants.

1342
01:20:51,685 --> 01:20:53,598
You think you are very smart.

1343
01:20:53,754 --> 01:20:56,032
Instead of killing those 12 people if you would've caught them alive..

1344
01:20:56,290 --> 01:20:57,702
...then we would've got some information.

1345
01:20:57,858 --> 01:20:59,862
It's of no use.

1346
01:21:00,328 --> 01:21:02,674
Because they never know what the plan is.

1347
01:21:02,729 --> 01:21:04,369
What?
- Yes.

1348
01:21:04,665 --> 01:21:07,672
Those 12 people didn't even know each other.

1349
01:21:07,734 --> 01:21:09,010
What are you saying!

1350
01:21:09,470 --> 01:21:11,611
These people are called sleeper cells.

1351
01:21:11,873 --> 01:21:13,752
Whether you call them their heads or bosses..

1352
01:21:13,775 --> 01:21:15,620
Can be one, two or three..

1353
01:21:15,810 --> 01:21:17,449
They make the plan together.

1354
01:21:17,511 --> 01:21:21,726
And then they find people who are ready to sacrifice their lives.

1355
01:21:21,783 --> 01:21:25,599
And the ones who are ready to sacrifice their lives are called sleeper cells.

1356
01:21:25,653 --> 01:21:27,031
That's why it's no use capturing them.

1357
01:21:27,088 --> 01:21:29,001
Because they don't know anything.

1358
01:21:30,325 --> 01:21:34,709
So till these sleeper cells don't get orders
from their boss they lead a normal life?

1359
01:21:34,762 --> 01:21:35,867
Exactly.

1360
01:21:35,930 --> 01:21:38,311
We won't even know where they are.

1361
01:21:38,433 --> 01:21:39,937
It can be our neighbour.

1362
01:21:40,002 --> 01:21:42,280
Or the one sitting next to us in a bus.

1363
01:21:42,337 --> 01:21:43,476
It can even be our courier boy.

1364
01:21:43,538 --> 01:21:44,517
It can be anyone.

1365
01:21:44,573 --> 01:21:46,521
So how do we destroy them?

1366
01:21:46,574 --> 01:21:48,556
There's one way to destroy them.

1367
01:21:48,610 --> 01:21:51,720
Kill their head or boss.

1368
01:21:52,280 --> 01:21:56,323
Once he is dead, their connection shall end.

1369
01:21:56,384 --> 01:21:58,993
And as the sleeper cells won't get any orders, they'll become dormant.

1370
01:21:59,054 --> 01:22:02,403
Just a minute! But how will you find the head of the sleeper cells?

1371
01:22:02,925 --> 01:22:04,565
Who said I will find him?

1372
01:22:04,627 --> 01:22:05,868
He will find me.

1373
01:22:05,928 --> 01:22:08,035
What?
- Because of what I have done.

1374
01:22:08,898 --> 01:22:11,074
We killed 12 of his men..
- Yes.

1375
01:22:11,334 --> 01:22:14,945
He will surely attack us to seek revenge.

1376
01:22:15,604 --> 01:22:19,819
According to my plan, he will soon show himself.

1377
01:22:20,844 --> 01:22:24,317
But in a big city like Mumbai, how will he find you?

1378
01:22:26,750 --> 01:22:28,321
We killed his men?

1379
01:22:28,384 --> 01:22:28,920
Right.

1380
01:22:28,985 --> 01:22:30,660
We must've made some mistake.

1381
01:22:30,720 --> 01:22:32,633
We must've left some clue behind.

1382
01:22:32,889 --> 01:22:34,962
He will come out to look for the clue.

1383
01:22:35,024 --> 01:22:42,610
If we find out what that clue is we can capture him before he attacks.

1384
01:22:43,333 --> 01:22:45,008
Then get thinking about what that clue is.

1385
01:22:45,302 --> 01:22:46,859
Move that colourful thing..

1386
01:22:46,885 --> 01:22:48,038
What is it called?

1387
01:22:48,639 --> 01:22:49,641
Cube?

1388
01:22:49,974 --> 01:22:53,618
Move the cube, they will help you find out.

1389
01:22:53,911 --> 01:22:54,890
Right?

1390
01:22:55,813 --> 01:22:57,316
Because if you have left a clue behind..

1391
01:22:57,381 --> 01:22:58,885
You won't answer this call.

1392
01:22:58,949 --> 01:23:02,399
No! Today you need to decide, friend or girlfriend.

1393
01:23:02,820 --> 01:23:04,392
Girlfriend.
- Good..

1394
01:23:04,856 --> 01:23:05,631
Hello?

1395
01:23:05,690 --> 01:23:08,731
Your sir has summoned us to his house.
Right away.

1396
01:23:08,793 --> 01:23:09,772
Okay, I am coming.

1397
01:23:09,827 --> 01:23:11,968
Hurry up.
- Yes, I'm coming.

1398
01:23:12,029 --> 01:23:13,596
Virat! What are you doing?

1399
01:23:13,622 --> 01:23:14,765
Let's go inside..

1400
01:23:15,800 --> 01:23:16,939
Virat!

1401
01:23:26,812 --> 01:23:28,087
Jyoti..

1402
01:23:35,687 --> 01:23:37,464
Remain seated. Sit.

1403
01:23:37,956 --> 01:23:39,938
She is Jyoti, my neighbour.

1404
01:23:39,991 --> 01:23:41,266
Hi.

1405
01:23:41,960 --> 01:23:45,275
She has been in love with me since childhood.

1406
01:23:45,764 --> 01:23:46,766
Sit.

1407
01:23:47,366 --> 01:23:51,045
After hearing the news that I am going to get married to you, she..

1408
01:23:52,771 --> 01:23:54,411
She was going to commit suicide.

1409
01:23:54,473 --> 01:23:55,752
We got her hospitalised.

1410
01:23:55,778 --> 01:23:57,004
It was a big problem.

1411
01:23:57,376 --> 01:23:59,825
Then I decided..

1412
01:24:01,848 --> 01:24:04,627
I am sorry, I will marry Jyoti.

1413
01:24:07,020 --> 01:24:08,398
I know..

1414
01:24:09,756 --> 01:24:12,295
This must've come to you as a huge shock.

1415
01:24:14,428 --> 01:24:18,403
I evoked love in your head, I made a mistake.

1416
01:24:21,735 --> 01:24:22,841
No more suicides.

1417
01:24:22,867 --> 01:24:24,039
Life is precious.

1418
01:24:26,373 --> 01:24:28,480
Now I have a question for the two of you.

1419
01:24:28,542 --> 01:24:29,544
Yes, sir.

1420
01:24:29,576 --> 01:24:32,355
You came here on a holiday, to get married.

1421
01:24:32,980 --> 01:24:33,685
Yes, sir.

1422
01:24:33,747 --> 01:24:34,818
Here..

1423
01:24:35,448 --> 01:24:38,626
And you wanted to marry a military man?

1424
01:24:39,286 --> 01:24:40,027
Yes.

1425
01:24:40,487 --> 01:24:42,629
Why don't the two of you get married?

1426
01:24:43,958 --> 01:24:45,735
But sir..
- Virat!

1427
01:24:45,926 --> 01:24:47,031
Don't act suspicious..

1428
01:24:47,294 --> 01:24:49,868
I loved her, but I never touched her.

1429
01:24:50,631 --> 01:24:52,306
That's by mistake.

1430
01:24:52,700 --> 01:24:54,306
Ask her!

1431
01:24:56,670 --> 01:25:01,784
Look, I can understand that it won't be easy for you to forget me.

1432
01:25:02,944 --> 01:25:04,049
Now what can I do?

1433
01:25:04,312 --> 01:25:06,624
It's not my fault that I am so handsome.

1434
01:25:06,680 --> 01:25:08,457
Yes, sir!
- Strange guy.

1435
01:25:08,516 --> 01:25:10,931
He stands up for anything I say.

1436
01:25:12,386 --> 01:25:14,061
Well, all the best.

1437
01:25:15,557 --> 01:25:16,935
Thank you, sir.

1438
01:25:17,025 --> 01:25:18,027
Thank you. Bye.
- Bye.

1439
01:25:18,293 --> 01:25:18,931
Thank you.
- Bye.

1440
01:25:18,993 --> 01:25:20,440
Come on, let's go.

1441
01:25:20,696 --> 01:25:21,903
Saiba..

1442
01:25:25,367 --> 01:25:25,970
Yeah?

1443
01:25:26,034 --> 01:25:28,313
Because we couldn't get married..

1444
01:25:30,572 --> 01:25:31,449
Never do this.

1445
01:25:31,506 --> 01:25:32,611
<i>I'll m].</i>

1446
01:25:32,674 --> 01:25:33,915
All the best.

1447

Let's go.

1448
01:25:36,345 --> 01:25:37,654
Hurry Up-

1449
01:25:37,812 --> 01:25:39,259
Bye, sir.

1450

<i>“Blame it on the night.”</i>

1467
01:27:11,710 --> 01:27:13,953

01:27:14,012 --> 01:27:15,492

01:28:40,868 --> 01:28:44,319
<i>“Blame the night!”</i>

1492
01:28:44,372 --> 01:28:47,720
<i>“Blame the night!”</i>

1493
01:28:47,775 --> 01:28:51,625
<i>“Blame the night!”</i>

1494
01:28:51,679 --> 01:28:54,925
<i>“Tonight.

1495

01:28:56,985 --> 01:28:58,624
<i>“Let's be shameless.”</i>

1497
01:28:58,686 --> 01:29:00,497

<i>“Blame it on the night.”</i>

1501
01:29:19,675 --> 01:29:20,484
What are you doing? What...?

1502
01:29:20,542 --> 01:29:21,851
Where...? Where are you taking me?

1503
01:29:22,043 --> 01:29:23,854
It's still..
the song is still playing.

1504
01:29:27,116 --> 01:29:29,064
“Blame the night.”

1505
01:29:30,352 --> 01:29:31,058
What's wrong?

1506
01:29:31,720 --> 01:29:32,756
Are you okay?

1507
01:29:36,592 --> 01:29:38,403
Your body temperature seems high.

1508
01:29:39,628 --> 01:29:42,407
Today is our first date so..

1509
01:29:42,832 --> 01:29:43,971
You know the rules.

1510
01:29:44,033 --> 01:29:48,384
According to that you need to give your boyfriend whatever he asks for.

1511
01:29:48,705 --> 01:29:50,345
That's why I am a little scared.

1512
01:29:50,407 --> 01:29:52,320
But I don't want anything.

1513
01:29:52,409 --> 01:29:53,650
You brought me to such a nice club.

1514
01:29:53,710 --> 01:29:55,316
You spent a lot of money.

1515
01:29:55,378 --> 01:29:56,330
I am okay.
I am happy.

1516
01:29:56,356 --> 01:29:57,351
Come on, let's dance.

1517
01:29:57,381 --> 01:29:58,520
Idiot.

1518
01:29:58,615 --> 01:30:00,927
Suppose if you had asked for a kiss on our first date!

1519
01:30:00,983 --> 01:30:02,692
I would have to kiss you, right?

1520
01:30:09,726 --> 01:30:11,071
Yes, you will have to kiss me.

1521
01:30:11,328 --> 01:30:14,643
Saw? 
This is what I feared.

1522
01:30:15,532 --> 01:30:16,911
I want a kiss.

1523
01:30:18,468 --> 01:30:19,949
So, what should I do now?

1524
01:30:20,438 --> 01:30:22,077
Nothing, just close your eyes.

1525
01:30:22,373 --> 01:30:23,910
I'll do whatever needs to be done.

01:30:46,665 --> 01:30:47,906
Damn..

1547
01:30:50,636 --> 01:30:51,581
Yes?

1548
01:30:51,703 --> 01:30:52,512
Listen..

1549
01:30:52,571 --> 01:30:55,384
I found the clue which he will use to find us.

1550
01:30:55,407 --> 01:30:56,409
What?

1551
01:30:59,311 --> 01:31:01,315
I'll find out everything.
Okay?

1552
01:31:02,314 --> 01:31:03,350
Hey..

1553
01:31:04,549 --> 01:31:05,893
Idiot.

1554
01:31:08,954 --> 01:31:11,767
But how will he know we left from the church?

1555
01:31:12,358 --> 01:31:15,467
There was just one similarity in the shootout of those 12 people.

1556
01:31:15,660 --> 01:31:17,437
And that's their dress-code.

1557
01:31:18,364 --> 01:31:22,009
If he is very smart, he will come straight to the church.

1558
01:31:35,715 --> 01:31:38,756
Of all the functions that took place on the 27th in Mumbai..

1559
01:31:38,818 --> 01:31:41,893
...the wedding in this church is the only event that matches with our list.

1560
01:31:42,422 --> 01:31:44,870
Because the one who got married is a military man.

1561
01:31:46,994 --> 01:31:48,406
Yes?

1562
01:31:50,530 --> 01:31:55,679
The name of the bridegroom is William Maﬂin Joel.

1563
01:31:56,604 --> 01:31:58,312
Can we get his address?

1564
01:31:58,371 --> 01:31:59,579
Yes.
- Please.

1565
01:32:05,479 --> 01:32:06,618
Yes?

1566
01:32:06,747 --> 01:32:08,956
Joel's residence?
- Yes.

1567
01:32:09,082 --> 01:32:10,383
We are from the army.

1568
01:32:10,409 --> 01:32:11,522
His batch mates.

1569
01:32:11,719 --> 01:32:14,566
Okay! Come, come, come.

1570
01:32:15,356 --> 01:32:16,597
Joel is on honeymoon.

1571
01:32:16,657 --> 01:32:17,933
Did you contact him on his mobile?

1572
01:32:17,992 --> 01:32:19,666
His phone was out of reach, uncle.

1573
01:32:19,726 --> 01:32:21,041
Oh! Hill station.

1574
01:32:21,067 --> 01:32:21,995
I am sorry.

1575
01:32:22,030 --> 01:32:24,603
Come. She's Joel's mom.

1576
01:32:24,733 --> 01:32:25,657
She's cannot speak.

1577
01:32:25,683 --> 01:32:26,681
- Oh, I'm so sorry.

1578
01:32:26,701 --> 01:32:27,680
Come, sit.

1579
01:32:28,936 --> 01:32:30,747
I have brought a gift for Joel.

1580
01:32:30,805 --> 01:32:32,349
Oh, thank you very much.

1581
01:32:32,375 --> 01:32:33,403
God bless you.

1582
01:32:34,375 --> 01:32:35,447
What will you have to drink?

1583
01:32:35,510 --> 01:32:37,047
No, thank you, uncle.

1584
01:32:40,014 --> 01:32:42,827
Uncle, can we have a look at Joel's wedding album?

1585
01:32:42,884 --> 01:32:44,797
Why not! I'll just get it.

1586
01:32:47,689 --> 01:32:49,602
That's great, madam!

1587
01:32:49,824 --> 01:32:52,706
You will give the address to any stranger?

1588
01:32:52,761 --> 01:32:56,440
Isn't it your duty to at least call his family and inform?

1589
01:32:56,498 --> 01:32:57,179
This isn't the time to argue.

1590
01:32:57,205 --> 01:32:57,696
Let's go. 
Hurry up.

1591
01:32:57,732 --> 01:32:58,353
What do I say about.

1592
01:32:58,379 --> 01:32:58,999
- Let's get going.

1593
01:32:59,034 --> 01:33:01,016
No one is answering the phone at their residence.

1594
01:33:03,038 --> 01:33:04,713
He's Joel's school teacher.

1595
01:33:04,873 --> 01:33:06,718
And this is Joel's cousin.

1596
01:33:17,086 --> 01:33:18,999
They are Joel's batch-mates.

1597
01:33:39,375 --> 01:33:40,822
Uncle, there are five teams in this.

1598
01:33:40,877 --> 01:33:42,984
Yes, so far he has been to five camps.

1599
01:33:43,046 --> 01:33:44,823
That's why there are five teams.

1600
01:33:45,582 --> 01:33:46,653
Can I have a cup of coffee?

1601
01:33:46,716 --> 01:33:47,953
Oh yes, sure.

1602
01:33:47,979 --> 01:33:49,691
I'll just get it.

1603
01:33:52,489 --> 01:33:53,798
We got stuck at the last stage.

1604
01:33:53,857 --> 01:33:57,604
How will we know which team out of these five?

1605
01:33:59,563 --> 01:34:00,873
I will find out.

1606
01:34:01,933 --> 01:34:03,881
Boys, here's your coffee.

1607
01:34:03,934 --> 01:34:05,346
Thank you.

1608
01:34:17,782 --> 01:34:19,091
You returned so soon!

1609
01:34:19,350 --> 01:34:21,525
I couldn't find that medicine anywhere.

1610
01:34:22,420 --> 01:34:23,729
They are Joel's batch-mates.

1611
01:34:23,788 --> 01:34:24,893
They couldn't attend the wedding.

1612
01:34:24,956 --> 01:34:26,006
Welcome! Welcome!

1613
01:34:26,032 --> 01:34:26,562
Welcome!

1614
01:34:26,591 --> 01:34:28,630
I'm Noel. Joel's brother.
- Hi.

1615
01:34:28,793 --> 01:34:29,397
Sit.

1616
01:34:29,461 --> 01:34:30,839
Dad, did you give them coffee or something?

1617
01:34:30,895 --> 01:34:32,274
Yes.
- Oh great. Okay.

1618
01:34:32,964 --> 01:34:34,672
Thanks for coming, guys.

1619
01:34:35,400 --> 01:34:37,643
In which camp was Joel with you?

1620
01:34:39,304 --> 01:34:40,409
Kashmir.

1621
01:34:41,406 --> 01:34:42,579
Which year?

1622
01:34:44,743 --> 01:34:46,052
2005.

1623
01:34:46,845 --> 01:34:50,318
Joel was in Delhi in 2005.

1624
01:34:50,583 --> 01:34:53,328
After that he never sewed in Kashmir.

1625
01:35:00,392 --> 01:35:02,031
Can I see your ID cards?

1626
01:35:05,497 --> 01:35:07,479
Can you show me your ID cards?

1627
01:35:10,036 --> 01:35:10,879
Show me.

1628
01:35:10,937 --> 01:35:12,679
May I see your ID cards?

1629
01:35:12,872 --> 01:35:15,651
Dad! You are just too much!

1630
01:35:15,708 --> 01:35:17,552
You just let anyone enter the house!

1631
01:35:17,610 --> 01:35:18,088
What happened?

1632
01:35:18,344 --> 01:35:19,540
I asked them about work.

1633
01:35:19,566 --> 01:35:20,909
They don't know anything.

1634
01:35:20,947 --> 01:35:24,831
I hate smart people.

1635
01:35:35,395 --> 01:35:36,431
Show me!

1636
01:35:36,563 --> 01:35:37,542
Show me!

1637
01:35:43,003 --> 01:35:46,579
I need to leave a message for him.

1638
01:36:05,326 --> 01:36:07,706
They are smarter than I thought.

1639
01:36:26,848 --> 01:36:28,830
Why has these people circled?

1640
01:36:29,383 --> 01:36:29,885
Look"

1641
01:36:30,819 --> 01:36:34,327
To find out which one team out of these five shot those 12 people..

1642
01:36:34,390 --> 01:36:37,704
...he will pick one member from each team.

1643
01:36:37,759 --> 01:36:40,641
And he has circled those he will pick.

1644
01:36:40,695 --> 01:36:42,370
He is very smart.

1645
01:36:46,402 --> 01:36:47,006
Hello?

1646
01:36:47,102 --> 01:36:49,106
Hi, I'm Captain Virat Bakshi here.

1647
01:36:49,571 --> 01:36:51,553
Look, I want to tell you something.

1648
01:36:51,606 --> 01:36:54,681
According to our intelligence report your life is in danger.

1649
01:36:54,744 --> 01:36:55,620
Are you safe?

1650
01:36:55,678 --> 01:36:57,124
Yes, I am okay.

1651
01:36:57,446 --> 01:36:58,448
Are you sure?

1652
01:36:58,580 --> 01:36:59,754
Yes, there's no problem.

1653
01:36:59,915 --> 01:37:03,388
Please call me back on this number if you face any problem.

1654
01:37:03,453 --> 01:37:04,626
Please note down this number.

1655
01:37:04,687 --> 01:37:05,792
Okay.

1656
01:37:09,892 --> 01:37:11,430
Yes, Virat. I am fine.

1657
01:37:11,494 --> 01:37:12,530
Yes, I am safe.

1658
01:37:12,629 --> 01:37:13,836
Yes Virat, I am fine.

1659
01:37:13,930 --> 01:37:16,675
I'll surely call you if there is any problem.

1660
01:37:18,068 --> 01:37:19,139
What?

1661
01:37:19,469 --> 01:37:21,508
All those who were circled are safe.

1662
01:37:25,042 --> 01:37:26,579
That's the problem.

1663
01:37:27,410 --> 01:37:29,517
It's not as we thought.

1664
01:37:30,748 --> 01:37:33,789
That means they are planning something else.

1665
01:37:34,785 --> 01:37:36,698
That can be dangerous.

1666
01:38:21,666 --> 01:38:23,705
Virat. Amar Singh here.

1667
01:38:23,968 --> 01:38:26,383
Someone has kidnapped my niece.

1668
01:38:27,372 --> 01:38:28,408
When?

1669
01:38:28,506 --> 01:38:31,012
She went to the yoga class in the morning, but still hasn't returned.

1670
01:38:31,376 --> 01:38:34,451
They took her saying that we have sent a car from home.

1671
01:38:35,347 --> 01:38:37,488
File a complaint in your area's police station immediately.

1672
01:38:37,549 --> 01:38:38,528
Don't worn]. Nothing will happen.

1673
01:38:38,583 --> 01:38:39,791
Hurry up. Go.

1674
01:38:48,060 --> 01:38:48,937
Yes, Vi rat?

1675
01:38:49,562 --> 01:38:52,978
You cannot get any information by torturing an army man.

1676
01:38:53,098 --> 01:38:55,342
That's why they are kidnapping the girls in their family.

1677
01:38:55,434 --> 01:38:56,539
Bloody cowards.

1678
01:38:56,702 --> 01:38:57,374
Why?

1679
01:38:57,403 --> 01:38:59,908
To find out which team killed those 12 terrorists.

1680
01:38:59,972 --> 01:39:03,549
...they'll kidnap the girls and threaten the family on the phone.

1681
01:39:03,609 --> 01:39:04,748
They will blackmail them.

1682
01:39:04,911 --> 01:39:07,587
I'm sending you the numbers of the 5 guys..

1683
01:39:07,646 --> 01:39:10,893
...he had marked in the album right away.

1684
01:39:11,351 --> 01:39:12,730
Listen to me very carefully, Mukund.

1685
01:39:12,819 --> 01:39:13,958
Call them.

1686
01:39:14,087 --> 01:39:18,062
Ask them to give the numbers of all the girls that are not in the house.

1687
01:39:18,424 --> 01:39:19,734
Go to the control room..

1688
01:39:19,793 --> 01:39:23,540
...and check in which area are their sim cards travelling.

1689
01:39:23,663 --> 01:39:24,642
Okay.

1690
01:39:32,672 --> 01:39:33,617
Yes, tell me.

1691
01:39:33,740 --> 01:39:34,742
Where are you?

1692
01:39:34,808 --> 01:39:36,346
I'm going to the designing class.

1693
01:39:36,377 --> 01:39:37,881
Where are you at this ven/ moment?

1694
01:39:37,945 --> 01:39:39,516
Santacruz. Why?

1695
01:39:40,380 --> 01:39:41,325
These five mobile numbers..

1696
01:39:41,348 --> 01:39:43,091
Quickly track in which area they are.
- Yes, sir.

1697
01:39:53,995 --> 01:39:54,804
Hello?

1698
01:39:54,895 --> 01:39:57,036
Virat, my sister went for jogging in the morning.

1699
01:39:57,498 --> 01:39:59,605
Someone forced her into a car and left.

1700
01:39:59,700 --> 01:40:00,611
Yeah?

1701
01:40:07,775 --> 01:40:08,880
This number is not showing.

1702
01:40:08,944 --> 01:40:09,952
This.. Yes, Virat?

1703
01:40:09,978 --> 01:40:11,713
I was just about to call you.

1704
01:40:11,746 --> 01:40:12,657
Why? What happened?

1705
01:40:12,714 --> 01:40:16,063
Out of those five girls one girl's number is already deactivated.

1706
01:40:16,118 --> 01:40:18,031
And another number just got deactivated.

1707
01:40:18,119 --> 01:40:20,602
I too received a phone call 45 minutes ago.

1708
01:40:20,789 --> 01:40:22,828
They kidnapped another girl.

1709
01:40:23,391 --> 01:40:24,804
Virat, we need a big police force for it.

1710
01:40:24,860 --> 01:40:26,967
Their families have filed police complaints.

1711
01:40:27,028 --> 01:40:29,067
Please don't get confuse now.

1712
01:40:29,598 --> 01:40:30,509
What are you going to do?

1713
01:40:30,566 --> 01:40:31,511
I'll tell you.

1714
01:40:31,633 --> 01:40:34,742
First you tell me where did that second cell phone get deactivated?

1715
01:40:34,803 --> 01:40:38,653
Four kilometres from where she studied, travelling towards south-Mumbai..

1716
01:40:38,707 --> 01:40:41,020
Her sim card was deactivated in Byculla.

1717
01:40:41,477 --> 01:40:43,584
And the girl who went missing before her..

1718
01:40:43,745 --> 01:40:45,818
Her sim card too was deactivated in Byculla.

1719
01:40:45,882 --> 01:40:48,889
Okay. Do one thing. Leave for Byculla.

1720
01:40:48,952 --> 01:40:49,954
I'll meet you on the way.

1721
01:40:50,019 --> 01:40:54,369
Listen Virat, let's call and immediately warn the rest of the three girls..

1722
01:40:54,423 --> 01:40:55,836
...not to get out of the house alone.

1723
01:40:55,892 --> 01:40:57,234
Look, don't do anything.

1724
01:40:57,260 --> 01:40:58,491
Don't ruin anything.

1725
01:40:58,528 --> 01:41:02,571
That sleeper cells' head is more important than those five girls.

1726
01:41:02,899 --> 01:41:03,605
Got it?

1727
01:41:03,700 --> 01:41:05,545
Now quickly leave that place.
- Hello, Virat?

1728
01:41:06,102 --> 01:41:07,081
Shit.

1729
01:41:14,044 --> 01:41:14,784
Hello?

1730
01:41:14,844 --> 01:41:18,022
My sister went to college in the morning to attend a seminar.

1731
01:41:19,582 --> 01:41:21,461
The fourth girl was also taken.

1732
01:41:25,355 --> 01:41:26,357
Hello?

1733
01:41:27,892 --> 01:41:30,569
Yes! The fifth girl was also kidnapped!

1734
01:41:31,061 --> 01:41:32,474
Are you a human or a sadist?

1735
01:41:32,530 --> 01:41:33,737
Why are you so happy?

1736
01:41:34,031 --> 01:41:35,569
Five girls have been kidnapped.

1737
01:41:35,633 --> 01:41:37,478
You are not at all worried about them?

1738
01:41:38,769 --> 01:41:40,842
I know what is important for you.

1739
01:41:41,372 --> 01:41:43,820
Sleeper cells' head should come outside so that you can kill him.

1740
01:41:43,874 --> 01:41:44,910
Right?

1741
01:41:45,376 --> 01:41:48,792
Do you know what will happen if he is caught?

1742
01:41:48,980 --> 01:41:51,896
All the bomb blasts and terrorist acts happening in Mumbai..

1743
01:41:51,950 --> 01:41:54,023
...will stop for many years to come. Got it?

1744
01:41:54,085 --> 01:41:58,560
But the lives of the five girls who have been kidnapped are at stake.

1745
01:41:58,623 --> 01:41:59,556
Think about them.

1746
01:41:59,582 --> 01:42:01,063
Think about their family.

1747
01:42:01,359 --> 01:42:02,931
I am not concerned about anything.

1748
01:42:02,994 --> 01:42:06,468
Will you say the same thing if someone from your family is kidnapped?

1749
01:42:06,531 --> 01:42:08,979
I told you, it makes no difference to me.

1750
01:42:09,468 --> 01:42:12,941
Anyway, out of those five girls one girl is my sister. Got it?

1751
01:42:14,673 --> 01:42:16,518
All I know is..

1752
01:42:16,775 --> 01:42:20,352
...that that terrorist will keep all the kidnapped girls at one place.

1753
01:42:20,679 --> 01:42:23,492
We need to save them and also catch that scoundrel.

1754
01:42:23,548 --> 01:42:25,359
No, wait a minute.

1755
01:42:25,617 --> 01:42:26,596
<i>P tee“?</i>

1756
01:42:26,651 --> 01:42:30,125
In those five photos one boy's name was Sarfaraz.

1757
01:42:30,890 --> 01:42:33,772
I sent my sister in place of his.

1758
01:42:33,826 --> 01:42:35,431
Where are you at this ven/ moment?

1759
01:42:35,494 --> 01:42:37,305
Santacruz.
Why?

1760
01:42:37,530 --> 01:42:38,532
Do one thing.

1761
01:42:38,598 --> 01:42:40,010
Go to Rizwi college.

1762
01:42:40,066 --> 01:42:42,070
You know my team-mate Sarfaraz?

1763
01:42:42,334 --> 01:42:44,408
Take his sister's Scooty and come here.

1764
01:42:44,737 --> 01:42:46,912
Why should I get her Scooty?

1765
01:42:47,374 --> 01:42:48,376
Because I am asking you to.

1766
01:42:48,441 --> 01:42:50,012
Go and get it right away!

1767
01:42:50,677 --> 01:42:52,852
There's a 40% discount at Lewis.

1768
01:42:52,912 --> 01:42:54,860
Will you buy me three-fourth pants?

1769
01:42:55,448 --> 01:42:57,036
I'll buy you two instead.

1770
01:42:57,062 --> 01:42:58,013
Hurry up now.

1771
01:42:58,051 --> 01:42:59,429
Okay.

1772
01:43:13,600 --> 01:43:15,012
Have you lost your mind, Virat!

1773
01:43:15,836 --> 01:43:16,872
I just can't think straight.

1774
01:43:16,970 --> 01:43:19,920
I mean being her brother how can you do this?

1775
01:43:20,040 --> 01:43:21,715
Nothing will happen to her.

1776
01:43:22,676 --> 01:43:24,749
Not just her, nothing will happen to anyone.

1777
01:43:25,912 --> 01:43:26,721
Stop. Stop here.

1778
01:43:26,780 --> 01:43:28,056
What's Pinkie doing over here?

1779
01:43:30,551 --> 01:43:31,530
Brother, this..

1780
01:43:42,597 --> 01:43:44,977
Brother, listen..
This is Preeti's stole.

1781
01:43:45,033 --> 01:43:46,946
And get a maroon top for me.

1782
01:43:47,001 --> 01:43:48,345
There should be embroidery done over here.

1783
01:43:48,402 --> 01:43:49,678
And I want mirror work over here.

1784
01:43:49,738 --> 01:43:50,877
Okay?
 Medium size.

1785
01:43:50,939 --> 01:43:52,852
Okay?
 Bye. See you.

1786
01:43:57,011 --> 01:43:58,082
Okay, Virat.

1787
01:43:58,413 --> 01:44:00,486
I'll go and ask my informers.

1788
01:44:00,548 --> 01:44:01,619
Let's see.

1789
01:44:16,599 --> 01:44:17,772
Go!

1790
01:44:41,357 --> 01:44:43,396
Untie their hands.

1791
01:44:49,800 --> 01:44:51,975
Project the photos one by one.

1792
01:44:54,804 --> 01:44:56,479
Who knows him?

1793
01:44:58,307 --> 01:45:00,722
Who knows him!

1794
01:45:01,978 --> 01:45:03,516
He's my brother.

1795
01:45:03,747 --> 01:45:04,954
Go over there.

1796
01:45:14,091 --> 01:45:16,004
My uncle..

1797
01:45:20,097 --> 01:45:21,772
He's my brother.

1798
01:45:30,375 --> 01:45:31,354
Your brother?

1799
01:45:31,809 --> 01:45:32,845
No.

1800
01:45:33,911 --> 01:45:35,016
Your brother?

1801
01:45:39,983 --> 01:45:41,658
Project the next photo.

1802
01:45:44,688 --> 01:45:45,930
He's my brother.

1803
01:45:47,625 --> 01:45:48,798
Go over there.

1804
01:45:59,838 --> 01:46:02,047
Your brother is not in these five photographs?

1805
01:46:02,340 --> 01:46:03,081
No.

1806
01:46:06,812 --> 01:46:08,760
Show the group photos one by one.

1807
01:46:11,584 --> 01:46:13,327
Is your brother there in this photograph?

1808
01:46:31,671 --> 01:46:33,015
That's him.

1809
01:46:34,574 --> 01:46:35,451
He?

1810
01:46:35,508 --> 01:46:36,487
No.

1811
01:46:37,677 --> 01:46:38,588
He?

1812
01:46:39,912 --> 01:46:41,017
Yes.

1813
01:46:45,818 --> 01:46:51,399
Who asked you to drive the Scooty of the girl we were going to kidnap?

1814
01:46:54,094 --> 01:46:55,438
My brother.

1815
01:47:07,407 --> 01:47:08,045
Yes?

1816
01:47:08,408 --> 01:47:10,014
The operation is successful.

1817
01:47:10,511 --> 01:47:12,891
We know the team of those 12 people.

1818
01:47:13,013 --> 01:47:16,430
One member of that team sent his sister in place of another.

1819
01:47:16,517 --> 01:47:18,897
I've discarded the sim cards from the phones of all the girls.

1820
01:47:18,986 --> 01:47:22,767
He has no chance of finding out where we are.

1821
01:47:22,823 --> 01:47:24,395
No, no, no!

1822
01:47:24,592 --> 01:47:25,833
He is not a fool.

1823
01:47:25,893 --> 01:47:30,711
If he can send his sister then he must've found a way to reach you.

1824
01:47:30,899 --> 01:47:32,744
He will find you.

1825
01:47:32,968 --> 01:47:34,004
What are you saying?!

1826
01:47:34,068 --> 01:47:37,645
Kill the girls and vacate the place before he finds you.

1827
01:47:37,706 --> 01:47:38,913
Right away!
Tie these four girls!

1828
01:47:38,974 --> 01:47:39,817
Okay.

1829
01:47:39,875 --> 01:47:41,355
And bring this girl over here.

1830
01:47:41,409 --> 01:47:42,081
Hurry up!

1831
01:47:42,343 --> 01:47:43,517
Come on!

1832
01:47:46,648 --> 01:47:47,821
Come with me!

1833
01:47:49,385 --> 01:47:50,558
Set up the camera.

1834
01:47:51,787 --> 01:47:52,732
Bring them here.

1835
01:47:53,489 --> 01:47:54,628
Hurry up.
 Make her sit!

1836
01:48:09,005 --> 01:48:10,610
Silence.

1837
01:49:30,621 --> 01:49:31,430
He is here.

1838
01:49:31,856 --> 01:49:33,531
He is trying to kill everyone.

1839
01:50:21,607 --> 01:50:22,609
Turn around.

1840
01:51:31,680 --> 01:51:33,719
Come on! Come on!

1841
01:52:20,864 --> 01:52:22,971
Don't worry.
Everything will be fine.

1842
01:52:23,567 --> 01:52:25,742
I'll drop guys in a taxi.

1843
01:52:25,902 --> 01:52:30,413
If cops ask whether you saw anything say that it was too dark.

1844
01:52:30,440 --> 01:52:32,319
You couldn't see my face. Understood?

1845
01:52:32,342 --> 01:52:32,946
Okay?
- Yes.

1846
01:52:33,043 --> 01:52:34,352
Come on, get into the car.

1847
01:52:34,444 --> 01:52:35,082
Come on, fast.

1848
01:53:16,988 --> 01:53:19,665
Purposely!
You got me trapped purposely, didn't you!

1849
01:53:19,791 --> 01:53:21,830
He was holding such a big knife over here!

1850
01:53:21,927 --> 01:53:24,877
A little movement and he would've severed my head!

1851
01:53:25,864 --> 01:53:28,871
We could catch him because we placed your life at risk!

1852
01:53:29,000 --> 01:53:31,540
You should have risked your own life!

1853
01:53:31,570 --> 01:53:33,552
Why me? What had I done?

1854
01:53:33,639 --> 01:53:36,088
Why? Can't you civilians sacrifice your lives?

1855
01:53:36,375 --> 01:53:39,825
Should only military and cops sacrifice theirs?

1856
01:53:39,879 --> 01:53:43,056
You just want to sit on your sofa and watch news channels.

1857
01:53:43,382 --> 01:53:44,761
And pass comments like..

1858
01:53:44,951 --> 01:53:46,955
“These cops should do this.”

1859
01:53:47,019 --> 01:53:48,664
“No, the militan/ is wrong.

1860
01:53:48,690 --> 01:53:50,028
They should do this"

1861
01:53:50,055 --> 01:53:51,798
You never want to do anything on your own.

1862
01:53:52,492 --> 01:53:56,444
What would've happened if I would've got shot in the crossfire?

1863
01:53:56,496 --> 01:53:57,123
What would've happened?

1864
01:53:57,149 --> 01:53:57,967
You would've lost your life.

1865
01:53:57,997 --> 01:53:59,444
What else could've happened?

1866
01:53:59,699 --> 01:54:03,378
Yeah, right, I would've lost my life.

1867
01:54:03,537 --> 01:54:04,744
<i>Free“,</i>

1868
01:54:05,838 --> 01:54:09,085
when those terrorists who intend to kill thousands.

1869
01:54:09,442 --> 01:54:13,519
...are ready to sacrifice their lives then why can't we?

1870
01:54:13,580 --> 01:54:14,616
Think about it.

1871
01:54:15,448 --> 01:54:19,868
Now look, because of you that main guy was caught, alive.

1872
01:54:20,587 --> 01:54:21,966
He isn't the main terrorist.

1873
01:54:22,022 --> 01:54:24,095
Someone called him up and ordered.

1874
01:54:24,357 --> 01:54:26,670
After that he took out the knife.

1875
01:55:37,400 --> 01:55:38,709
What's this?

1876
01:55:41,003 --> 01:55:42,313
Nail cutter.

1877
01:55:44,039 --> 01:55:45,041
What are you doing over here?

1878
01:55:45,308 --> 01:55:47,813
That day you left in the middle hence I came here.

1879
01:55:47,910 --> 01:55:50,587
Don't ever come up from behind me and startle me again.

1880
01:55:50,646 --> 01:55:51,751
Why?

1881
01:55:51,982 --> 01:55:54,932
There could've been someone else with me in this room.

1882
01:55:57,854 --> 01:56:00,861
Sandbag, dumbbells..

1883
01:56:01,625 --> 01:56:03,435
You workout as well.

1884
01:56:03,593 --> 01:56:04,834
Not bad.

1885
01:56:06,596 --> 01:56:08,578
You know I read this in a forwarded message..

1886
01:56:08,765 --> 01:56:11,840
That 40 calories are burned during a deep kiss.

1887
01:56:11,902 --> 01:56:13,645
That's equal to 30 minutes of brisk walking.

1888
01:56:13,670 --> 01:56:16,654
20 minutes of swimming, 10 minutes of skipping and 5 minutes of..

1889
01:56:17,674 --> 01:56:18,813
You want a kiss?

1890
01:56:18,975 --> 01:56:20,246
Then ask for it directly.

1891
01:56:20,272 --> 01:56:21,745
Don't beat around the bush.

1892
01:56:22,012 --> 01:56:23,960
Forward message, science of construction, email..

1893
01:56:24,015 --> 01:56:25,689
These are vacuous things.

1894
01:56:25,849 --> 01:56:28,560
Anyway, I very well know how girls like you are.

1895
01:56:28,853 --> 01:56:31,860
You want it but you blame us for it.

1896
01:56:32,089 --> 01:56:34,732
“You know, you know, you know, that boy is so mean!"

1897
01:56:34,792 --> 01:56:36,136
“You know I just hate him."

1898
01:56:36,393 --> 01:56:37,601
Useless.. - “My mom.."

1899
01:56:41,398 --> 01:56:45,442
Now that you are here why just 40..

1900
01:56:46,538 --> 01:56:48,486
...let's burn 80 calories.

1901
01:56:48,939 --> 01:56:51,388
Or 160?

1902
01:56:51,876 --> 01:56:54,485
Or 240?

1903
01:56:54,779 --> 01:56:57,854
By morning we both will be sporting six-packs.

1904
01:57:03,621 --> 01:57:04,498
Not here.

1905
01:57:04,722 --> 01:57:05,701
Let's go over there.

1906
01:57:09,662 --> 01:57:11,438
Now who is concerned about the location?

1907
01:57:11,496 --> 01:57:12,533
I am.

1908
01:57:12,698 --> 01:57:13,871
Close your eyes.

1909
01:57:17,035 --> 01:57:19,108
If I close my eyes, you will run away.

1910
01:57:19,170 --> 01:57:20,879
I won't.

1911
01:57:25,778 --> 01:57:26,553
Who is it?

1912
01:57:26,612 --> 01:57:28,491
I told you! I think mom's here!

1913
01:57:29,515 --> 01:57:30,893
Go and open the door, I'll go hide in this cupboard.

1914
01:57:30,916 --> 01:57:32,124
Not there! Not there!

1915
01:57:32,385 --> 01:57:33,126
Not there! Not there!

1916
01:57:33,352 --> 01:57:34,142
It contains my knickers.

1917
01:57:34,168 --> 01:57:35,154
Do one thing. You hide here!

1918
01:57:35,355 --> 01:57:37,132
Hide in here.

1919
01:57:38,057 --> 01:57:39,469
Hey.. - HUT"! UP!

1920
01:57:39,492 --> 01:57:40,768
Hurry.. Climb up!

1921
01:57:40,993 --> 01:57:42,702
Just take a deep breath.

1922
01:57:51,137 --> 01:57:52,082
Did you watch the television?

1923
01:57:52,439 --> 01:57:53,510
What's the score?

1924
01:57:53,707 --> 01:57:54,944
Stop the drama.

1925
01:57:54,970 --> 01:57:57,114
I just saw what you did.

1926
01:57:58,511 --> 01:57:59,991
16 people are dead.

1927
01:58:00,547 --> 01:58:02,153
All of them were sleeper cells.

1928
01:58:02,549 --> 01:58:05,032
Everyone had perfectly normal jobs.

1929
01:58:05,986 --> 01:58:08,730
Now the difficult job is to convince their family.

1930
01:58:08,788 --> 01:58:10,064
Because none of them are ready to believe that.

1931
01:58:10,090 --> 01:58:11,969
This is what I expected from them.

1932
01:58:12,625 --> 01:58:15,633
Did you find out anything about the head of the sleeper cell?

1933
01:58:27,708 --> 01:58:30,715
I knew it! I was sure that you'll bring him along!

1934
01:58:30,944 --> 01:58:32,892
But he isn't the head.

1935
01:58:32,980 --> 01:58:34,723
We still haven't found him.

1936
01:58:35,583 --> 01:58:36,927
Oh..

1937
01:58:38,352 --> 01:58:40,129
Why is he coughing like a girl?

1938
01:58:41,789 --> 01:58:42,734
What happened?

1939
01:58:43,424 --> 01:58:44,130
Are you alright?

1940
01:58:45,360 --> 01:58:46,669
Another sleeper cell?

1941
01:58:53,568 --> 01:58:57,884
You aren't used to keeping books and clothes in the cupboard?

1942
01:58:58,440 --> 01:58:59,749
Say hi to him.

1943
01:58:59,875 --> 01:59:01,481
Hi.
- Hi.

1944
01:59:02,010 --> 01:59:03,753
You are going to marry him?

1945
01:59:04,012 --> 01:59:04,889
Yes.

1946
01:59:04,980 --> 01:59:07,087
Wonderful.

1947
01:59:07,583 --> 01:59:10,157
He's half mad. You are half mad.

1948
01:59:10,652 --> 01:59:11,825
Kids will be fully mad.

1949
01:59:12,989 --> 01:59:14,731
He's feeling shy!

1950
01:59:31,674 --> 01:59:36,753
<i>“My head seems a little poetic!”</i>

1951

1954

This is related to the death of 12 sleeper cells.

2028
02:03:17,406 --> 02:03:18,716
The bomb blasts on 27th September..

2029
02:03:18,775 --> 02:03:23,752
He killed him because he didn't get any information.

2030
02:03:26,016 --> 02:03:30,629
The one you are looking for is one of these 12 people.

2031
02:03:31,087 --> 02:03:34,368
He is a cold-blooded murderer.

2032
02:03:35,024 --> 02:03:36,835
Instigate him.

2033
02:03:37,827 --> 02:03:39,740
Plan something big.

2034
02:03:40,663 --> 02:03:42,736
A powerful attack.

2035
02:03:43,833 --> 02:03:45,873
He will show himself.

2036
02:03:47,871 --> 02:03:51,652
Show him the power of sleeper cells.

2037
02:04:00,651 --> 02:04:01,463
Do one thing, mom.

2038
02:04:01,489 --> 02:04:02,885
Go ahead, I'll be there soon.

2039
02:04:02,920 --> 02:04:04,799
Hurry up.
- Yes, I'm coming.

2040
02:04:14,398 --> 02:04:16,402
Let's finish this game.

2041
02:04:17,102 --> 02:04:18,810
I want you.

2042
02:04:19,570 --> 02:04:20,606
Alive.

2043
02:04:22,440 --> 02:04:24,479
Call your team-mate Kapil.

2044
02:04:24,843 --> 02:04:26,517
He is at the R-city mall.

2045
02:04:26,679 --> 02:04:33,900
Tell him the building he is in is going to blast in 10 seconds.

2046
02:04:34,386 --> 02:04:35,889
Hey! Listen!

2047
02:04:42,361 --> 02:04:43,841
Hey, Virat!
 How are you?

2048
02:04:43,895 --> 02:04:45,535
Kapil!
 Where are you?

2049
02:04:45,597 --> 02:04:47,806
I'm out with my family.

2050
02:04:47,866 --> 02:04:49,074
But where are you?

2051
02:04:49,334 --> 02:04:50,643
R-city mall.

2052
02:04:52,571 --> 02:04:55,578
Kapil, take your family and leave that place right away.

2053
02:04:55,641 --> 02:04:56,450
There's a bomb over there.

2054
02:04:56,542 --> 02:04:57,852
Chocolate.
- Get out of there.

2055
02:04:57,910 --> 02:04:59,356
Chocolate?
- What are you saying?

2056
02:04:59,411 --> 02:05:01,984
Kapil, I said, the bomb is going to blast in five seconds.

2057
02:05:02,010 --> 02:05:02,751
Get out of there!

2058
02:05:03,015 --> 02:05:04,724
There are a lot of people here.

2059
02:05:04,784 --> 02:05:07,461
Inform everybody and leave!

2060
02:05:10,390 --> 02:05:11,392
Kapil!

2061
02:05:12,625 --> 02:05:13,853
Kapil, don't think!

2062
02:05:13,879 --> 02:05:15,429
Just get out of there!

2063
02:05:32,612 --> 02:05:33,684
Heard that?

2064
02:05:33,780 --> 02:05:35,591
How was the sound?

2065
02:05:36,584 --> 02:05:37,917
That's not all.

2066
02:05:37,943 --> 02:05:42,541
I know exactly where the rest of the 11 people are.

2067
02:05:42,556 --> 02:05:45,563
Because each one of them is being followed by a sleeper cell.

2068
02:05:45,626 --> 02:05:46,901
You want to check?

2069
02:05:48,862 --> 02:05:50,810
Monty Baggha, Juhu Beach.

2070
02:05:50,864 --> 02:05:52,903
Yogesh, Hanuman Temple.

2071
02:05:52,966 --> 02:05:55,074
Jigar Gill, COD Mulund.

2072
02:05:55,336 --> 02:05:57,375
Chirag Sethi, Mithibai College.

2073
02:05:57,505 --> 02:05:59,886
Sarfaraz, Sea-face, Caner Road.

2074
02:05:59,941 --> 02:06:02,014
Vishal, PVR Kurla.

2075
02:06:02,076 --> 02:06:04,080
Lalit, Phoenix Mall.

2076
02:06:04,345 --> 02:06:06,692
Sandeep Sachdeva, Andheri Market.

2077
02:06:06,748 --> 02:06:09,094
Abhay Shukla, Mount Man] Church.

2078
02:06:09,350 --> 02:06:11,765
Virat Bakshi, Bandra Market.

2079
02:06:11,853 --> 02:06:15,395
And Siddhanh, Goregaon Station.

2080
02:06:16,791 --> 02:06:18,898
Now let me blow up the next one.

2081
02:06:20,395 --> 02:06:24,039
Virat Bakshi, who is at the Bandra Market.

2082
02:06:28,003 --> 02:06:31,921
There will be a blast over there in the next three seconds.

2083
02:06:34,811 --> 02:06:35,721
Three..

2084
02:06:38,814 --> 02:06:39,759
Two..

2085
02:06:43,051 --> 02:06:43,962
One!

2086
02:06:48,123 --> 02:06:49,729
Boom!

2087
02:06:52,395 --> 02:06:53,534
Got scared?

2088
02:06:54,664 --> 02:06:55,973
You got scared huh?

2089
02:06:56,399 --> 02:06:58,540
I didn't place a bomb over there.

2090
02:06:58,568 --> 02:07:00,743
I don't want them dead.

2091
02:07:01,037 --> 02:07:02,517
I want you.

2092
02:07:02,973 --> 02:07:04,112
I need you.

2093
02:07:04,440 --> 02:07:05,579
Okay.

2094
02:07:06,075 --> 02:07:07,886
You want me, right?

2095
02:07:09,078 --> 02:07:10,524
I'll come to you.

2096
02:07:11,047 --> 02:07:12,527
Don't harm anyone else.

2097
02:07:12,648 --> 02:07:14,061
Good decision.

2098
02:07:14,918 --> 02:07:16,593
Get ready.

2099
02:07:24,695 --> 02:07:25,868
How are you?
- Hello, Virat!

2100
02:07:25,962 --> 02:07:27,500
Great!
- See you later.

2101
02:07:28,098 --> 02:07:29,450
What is this place?

2102
02:07:29,476 --> 02:07:30,470
Who are they?

2103
02:07:31,435 --> 02:07:36,446
We all know those who die in border war and counter terrorism.

2104
02:07:36,707 --> 02:07:40,956
They are the army officers who are handicapped during war.

2105
02:07:41,745 --> 02:07:43,693
No one knows them.

2106
02:07:43,948 --> 02:07:46,830
In every field, if you work sincerely, you get promoted.

2107
02:07:47,017 --> 02:07:50,399
But only in army and police..

2108
02:07:50,454 --> 02:07:51,958
You get retirement.

2109
02:07:52,456 --> 02:07:53,835
And that's a shame.

2110
02:07:53,958 --> 02:07:55,496
Hi, Virat.
- Hi.

2111
02:07:55,760 --> 02:07:56,865
Even/things ready.

2112
02:07:58,629 --> 02:07:59,904
Hello, everyone.

2113
02:07:59,964 --> 02:08:01,775
Hi.
- Hi.

2114
02:08:03,034 --> 02:08:04,140
How are you guys?

2115
02:08:04,402 --> 02:08:06,406
Fine. - Good.
- Great.

2116
02:08:06,704 --> 02:08:09,415
I've already spoken to all of you over the phone.

2117
02:08:09,740 --> 02:08:12,656
The time we have been waiting for has come.

2118
02:08:12,844 --> 02:08:16,091
We are going to execute an assignment together.

2119
02:08:19,818 --> 02:08:23,064
Tomorrow morning, I am going to meet the head.

2120
02:08:23,454 --> 02:08:25,436
The one who controls the sleeper cells.

2121
02:08:25,490 --> 02:08:29,500
At that moment no one can follow me because they'll keep an eye on me.

2122
02:08:29,628 --> 02:08:34,012
Before meeting him, I'm going to insert a tracking chip in my body.

2123
02:08:34,065 --> 02:08:37,573
That chip will indicate my movements.

2124
02:08:37,636 --> 02:08:39,777
And you will be communicating everything to him.

2125
02:08:39,838 --> 02:08:40,817
Okay?

2126
02:08:41,907 --> 02:08:48,422
I've very secretly called for cyclonite explosive that we use in the army.

2127
02:08:48,481 --> 02:08:50,156
We will get it by this evening.

2128
02:08:50,416 --> 02:08:53,525
With that we will make C-4 plastic explosive.

2129
02:08:53,586 --> 02:08:55,568
After making it you'll give it to Joel.

2130
02:08:55,622 --> 02:08:57,729
Joel, you'll be in touch with Mukund.

2131
02:08:57,791 --> 02:09:00,069
Mukund, you keep telling him where they are taking me.

2132
02:09:00,126 --> 02:09:02,575
I am sure they'll take me to an isolated place.

2133
02:09:13,973 --> 02:09:16,923
No one knows why he wants me alive.

2134
02:09:17,011 --> 02:09:19,619
I am sure there must be a reason behind it.

2135
02:09:19,680 --> 02:09:24,657
Exactly 15 minutes after I meet the sleeper cells' head..

2136
02:09:25,052 --> 02:09:27,797
...that bomb should explode, Joel.

2137
02:09:27,855 --> 02:09:29,928
It is your responsibility.

2138
02:09:30,758 --> 02:09:34,038
Along with me, those who order sleeper cells will also die.

2139
02:09:34,094 --> 02:09:38,479
After that all sleeper cells will become coma cells.

2140
02:09:38,799 --> 02:09:41,544
They will never receive any order.

2141
02:09:41,802 --> 02:09:43,613
It's like a suicide attack.

2142
02:09:43,671 --> 02:09:44,810
Boom!

2143
02:09:48,076 --> 02:09:50,388
What kind of a joke is this, Virat!

2144
02:09:50,711 --> 02:09:53,661
You are talking about suicide and they are applauding.

2145
02:09:54,549 --> 02:09:55,790
What's happening, man!

2146
02:09:55,851 --> 02:09:57,490
He is a very dangerous man.

2147
02:09:57,552 --> 02:10:00,468
Fine. But why do you need to sacrifice your life?

2148
02:10:01,389 --> 02:10:02,251
You too have a family.

2149
02:10:02,277 --> 02:10:03,020
Think about them!

2150
02:10:03,058 --> 02:10:05,404
They too had a family...!

2151
02:10:05,727 --> 02:10:07,868
Those who were killed during the Taj attack.

2152
02:10:09,130 --> 02:10:13,139
They too left at night telling their kids that they'll be back by morning.

2153
02:10:13,469 --> 02:10:15,542
Hemant Karkare, Vijay Salaskar, Ashok Kamte..

2154
02:10:15,604 --> 02:10:18,417
Sandeep Unnikrishnan, Sashank Shinde, Tukaram Omble.

2155
02:10:18,540 --> 02:10:19,918
They too had a family.

2156
02:10:20,008 --> 02:10:21,114
Their dead bodies reached home.

2157
02:10:21,177 --> 02:10:23,557
Have you thought about their families?

2158
02:10:24,113 --> 02:10:26,459
He talks about family!

2159
02:10:27,116 --> 02:10:28,995
Here.. look at them!

2160
02:10:29,151 --> 02:10:30,996
Some don't have a spinal cord.

2161
02:10:31,053 --> 02:10:32,124
Some don't have legs.

2162
02:10:32,387 --> 02:10:33,878
Some don't have hands.

2163
02:10:33,904 --> 02:10:35,055
Some are blind.

2164
02:10:35,557 --> 02:10:37,631
But still, they are happy.

2165
02:10:37,727 --> 02:10:39,675
They too have a family.

2166
02:10:50,940 --> 02:10:53,981
An army man couldn't get a better opportunity.

2167
02:10:55,612 --> 02:10:58,118
When those terrorists who intend to kill thousands are ready..

2168
02:10:58,381 --> 02:11:02,390
...to sacrifice their lives then why can't we, the protectors do that?

2169
02:11:06,122 --> 02:11:09,903
Mukund, I came to this decision after giving it a lot of thought.

2170
02:11:10,961 --> 02:11:13,443
If you want to do something for me..

2171
02:11:14,397 --> 02:11:17,006
My family is a little naive when it comes to the ways of the world.

2172
02:11:17,401 --> 02:11:18,779
I have two sisters.

2173
02:11:19,002 --> 02:11:23,513
Whenever you can spare some time, do visit them.

2174
02:11:37,856 --> 02:11:40,395
There's just four days left the engagement.

2175
02:11:40,892 --> 02:11:42,965
And all of a sudden you don't want to go ahead with.

2176
02:11:43,494 --> 02:11:45,134
It doesn't need to happen now.

2177
02:11:45,897 --> 02:11:47,674
We'll see when I come next.

2178
02:11:49,934 --> 02:11:51,916
But we are getting married next year.

2179
02:11:52,137 --> 02:11:54,518
We were just getting engaged.

2180
02:11:56,541 --> 02:11:58,386
But that's not needed either.

2181
02:11:59,711 --> 02:12:01,522
First you said that you don't like me.

2182
02:12:01,913 --> 02:12:03,519
Then you said you like me.

2183
02:12:04,116 --> 02:12:05,892
And now, once again..

2184
02:12:06,818 --> 02:12:08,493
Do you even really like me?

2185
02:12:08,553 --> 02:12:09,749
Don't you understand?

2186
02:12:09,775 --> 02:12:11,027
I said no, didn't I?

2187
02:12:11,456 --> 02:12:12,561
Not now.

2188
02:12:16,796 --> 02:12:18,709
Will you be able to forget me?

2189
02:12:25,170 --> 02:12:26,776
I won't be able to do it.

2190
02:13:40,781 --> 02:13:43,697
My man is standing next to you.

2191
02:13:47,422 --> 02:13:48,493
Where is he?

2192
02:14:18,487 --> 02:14:19,660
He's clean.

2193
02:14:24,994 --> 02:14:25,699
Hello..

2194
02:14:25,761 --> 02:14:31,445
Can you see an Indigo car, 3525, across the road?

2195
02:14:34,638 --> 02:14:35,879
Get in it.

2196
02:14:53,123 --> 02:14:58,100
Straight ahead, black Honda City, 7087.

2197
02:14:58,362 --> 02:15:01,539
Take it to Bombay Stock Exchange.

2198
02:18:34,418 --> 02:18:36,057
You must be wondering..

2199
02:18:36,587 --> 02:18:38,660
Why haven't I still killed you?

2200
02:18:38,756 --> 02:18:40,465
What's my plan?

2201
02:18:42,493 --> 02:18:43,837
You don't know, do you?

2202
02:18:44,128 --> 02:18:45,472
I'll tell you.

2203
02:18:52,603 --> 02:18:55,109
The cars you parked..

2204
02:19:00,511 --> 02:19:02,619
Do you know what was in them?

2205
02:19:10,187 --> 02:19:12,032
I won't blow them up.

2206
02:19:13,458 --> 02:19:15,565
I'll inform the police.

2207
02:19:16,594 --> 02:19:20,705
Then the question that shall arise will be who planted them.

2208
02:19:22,968 --> 02:19:23,639
Then..

2209
02:19:39,551 --> 02:19:41,533
While the police will be looking for you..

2210
02:19:41,787 --> 02:19:46,001
I would've already killed you and your 10 team-mates.

2211
02:19:46,058 --> 02:19:48,974
Rather according to the police, to kill you..

2212
02:19:49,027 --> 02:19:51,738
And to defuse the time bomb at the right time.

2213
02:19:51,897 --> 02:19:53,970
Do you know who will take the credit of it?

2214
02:19:55,635 --> 02:19:56,444
Look at this.

2215
02:19:57,103 --> 02:19:59,142
Mr. Alwyn Dsouza.

2216
02:20:00,606 --> 02:20:02,919
Joint Secretary of Defence.

2217
02:20:05,044 --> 02:20:09,155
Not just that, the 12 sleeper cells whom you have killed..

2218
02:20:09,582 --> 02:20:12,998
The credit of that as well will go to the Joint Secretary of Defence.

2219
02:20:13,653 --> 02:20:16,192
And with that he will get promoted.

2220
02:20:16,456 --> 02:20:19,668
And he will become the Secretary of Defence.

2221
02:20:20,059 --> 02:20:24,945
Virat, there are sleeper cells all across lndia..

2222
02:20:24,997 --> 02:20:27,606
...except in the Indian army.

2223
02:20:28,468 --> 02:20:30,108
But with this,

2224
02:20:30,604 --> 02:20:33,919
we will recruit sleeper cells in the Indian army as well.

2225
02:20:33,974 --> 02:20:38,427
Then we shall do everything we want to.

2226
02:20:42,883 --> 02:20:45,526
'I'll anyhow have to get out of here!'

2227
02:20:46,052 --> 02:20:47,590
'I cannot die.'

2228
02:20:48,155 --> 02:20:50,570
'Sleeper cells in the Indian army..'

2229
02:20:50,858 --> 02:20:52,737
'It's like cancer for our country.'

2230
02:21:21,088 --> 02:21:22,535
Any death wish?

2231
02:21:22,691 --> 02:21:24,468
Any last wishes?

2232
02:21:28,830 --> 02:21:31,439
I don't want you to use your gun to kill me.

2233
02:21:37,572 --> 02:21:38,608
Did you hear that?

2234
02:21:42,378 --> 02:21:45,761
I, too, don't want to use my gun to kill you.

2235
02:23:23,849 --> 02:23:24,794
Hit me.

2236
02:23:41,800 --> 02:23:43,645
Indian army!

2237
02:24:12,031 --> 02:24:14,571
Uncuff my hands and then hit me.

2238
02:24:15,435 --> 02:24:16,608
What did you say?

2239
02:24:20,707 --> 02:24:24,124
Uncuff my hands and then hit me.

2240
02:24:39,794 --> 02:24:40,739
Listen!

2241
02:24:42,963 --> 02:24:47,781
You boss is hitting me while my hands are cuffed.

2242
02:24:47,801 --> 02:24:50,648
And when I asked him to uncuffthem, he's thinking.

2243
02:24:52,440 --> 02:24:54,718
You've already broken my arms and legs.

2244
02:24:55,610 --> 02:24:59,585
You have so many men who have weapons with them.

2245
02:25:00,048 --> 02:25:01,996
And yet, you are scared.

2246
02:25:05,887 --> 02:25:07,835
You should be scared.

2247
02:25:09,424 --> 02:25:11,030
You should be scared.

2248
02:25:13,027 --> 02:25:14,565
Now laugh!

2249
02:25:14,963 --> 02:25:16,136
Laugh!

2250
02:25:16,430 --> 02:25:17,775
Laugh now!

2251
02:25:25,807 --> 02:25:29,691
You are scared to uncuff my hands and then hit me, aren't you?

2252
02:25:31,880 --> 02:25:34,124
I like this fear.

2253
02:25:34,816 --> 02:25:36,661
What are you doing, brother?

2254
02:25:36,718 --> 02:25:38,063
Just shoot him.
Shoot him.

2255
02:25:38,121 --> 02:25:39,054
He's very clever.

2256
02:25:39,080 --> 02:25:40,891
Heed my advice, just shoot him.

2257
02:25:40,923 --> 02:25:42,802
You cannot defeat him.

2258
02:25:45,027 --> 02:25:46,599
I mean..

2259
02:25:50,666 --> 02:25:51,873
Uncuff him.

2260
02:28:23,892 --> 02:28:25,874
What is he doing, brother?
- I don't know.

2261
02:29:01,463 --> 02:29:03,069
They will fight each other to death, brother.

2262
02:29:03,132 --> 02:29:04,222
Order me to shoot.

2263
02:29:04,248 --> 02:29:05,640
- No! Absolutely not!

2264
02:29:24,820 --> 02:29:26,130
No!

2265
02:29:47,110 --> 02:29:48,921
I say you shoot both of them!

2266
02:29:48,978 --> 02:29:49,980
Shoot them!

2267
02:29:50,046 --> 02:29:51,994
We don't have any other option left!

2268
02:29:52,048 --> 02:29:54,030
Shoot both of them.

2269
02:29:57,154 --> 02:30:00,000
Drop your weapons into the sea.

2270
02:30:01,925 --> 02:30:03,031
Hurry Up-

2271
02:30:05,128 --> 02:30:07,633
You.. Give me my handcuffs.

2272
02:30:10,835 --> 02:30:11,609
My watch..

2273
02:30:13,971 --> 02:30:14,916
Come on..

2274
02:30:38,696 --> 02:30:40,439
You are not smart

2275
02:30:40,832 --> 02:30:41,811
Why?

2276
02:30:41,834 --> 02:30:43,712
Even if you kill me..

2277
02:30:44,035 --> 02:30:49,923
...that ship contains all the network details to control the sleeper cells.

2278
02:30:50,976 --> 02:30:54,792
There are people who will continue this.

2279
02:30:56,448 --> 02:30:57,484
Wait.

2280
02:31:09,562 --> 02:31:10,769
Three..

2281
02:31:11,763 --> 02:31:12,937
Two..

2282
02:31:13,632 --> 02:31:14,908
One..

2283
02:31:16,168 --> 02:31:17,443
Boom!

2284
02:31:34,388 --> 02:31:35,868
You didn't understand, did you?

2285
02:31:38,825 --> 02:31:41,069
You should die in suspense.

2286
02:32:06,453 --> 02:32:09,596
If he would've said he liked the girl the day he had come..

2287
02:32:09,657 --> 02:32:11,195
...we would got them married before he left.

2288
02:32:11,459 --> 02:32:12,800
It's the same here.

2289
02:32:12,826 --> 02:32:14,730
But no one listens to us.

2290
02:32:14,762 --> 02:32:15,901
This boy I tell you..

2291
02:32:15,963 --> 02:32:17,205
Sir..
- He will never be serious in life.

2292
02:32:17,465 --> 02:32:18,536
Take care.

2293
02:32:18,666 --> 02:32:20,477
They make a superb couple, don't they, sir?

2294
02:32:22,736 --> 02:32:29,217
You know, the reason they are together today is me?

2295
02:32:29,678 --> 02:32:30,953
You, sir?

2296
02:32:33,414 --> 02:32:34,724
Yes.

2297
02:32:34,783 --> 02:32:39,601
Sir, the day we came here and his father took him away in a hurry..

2298
02:32:39,854 --> 02:32:42,394
That was to introduce him to this girl.

2299
02:32:42,790 --> 02:32:43,915
He rejected her.

2300
02:32:43,941 --> 02:32:45,628
Then she rejected him.

2301
02:32:45,793 --> 02:32:47,934
And when they both consented.

2302
02:32:47,996 --> 02:32:52,416
Some idiot came in the middle and confused everything.

2303
02:32:52,468 --> 02:32:54,780
But now everything is fine, sir.

2304
02:32:56,806 --> 02:33:01,452
But sir, why did you say that you are the reason they are together?

2305
02:33:01,744 --> 02:33:04,022
The story you told me..

2306
02:33:04,413 --> 02:33:04,915
Sir.

2307
02:33:05,013 --> 02:33:08,521
The idiot you mentioned in it..

2308
02:33:08,618 --> 02:33:09,689
Yes, sir.

2309
02:33:10,586 --> 02:33:11,895
That's 'ME'.

2310
02:33:13,689 --> 02:33:14,930
Come to the camp..

2311
02:33:15,592 --> 02:33:16,161
Yes, sir.

2312
02:33:16,426 --> 02:33:18,499
I'll hang the two of you upside down.

2313
02:33:19,796 --> 02:33:21,141
No, sir..

2314
02:33:28,872 --> 02:33:30,820
Truly, army is great.

2315
02:33:33,543 --> 02:33:37,495
For the next 11 months, on a snow-clad mountain.

2316
02:33:37,981 --> 02:33:42,435
Or in a desert, making your own tent, cooking your own food..

2317
02:33:43,687 --> 02:33:46,671
Thinking about these 40-days holiday..

2318
02:33:48,492 --> 02:33:51,874
Keep looking at the family photo tucked in the wallet.

2319
02:33:54,898 --> 02:33:57,142
This is how you'll have to live, right?

2320
02:33:58,602 --> 02:34:00,709
I'll miss you.
- Take care.
