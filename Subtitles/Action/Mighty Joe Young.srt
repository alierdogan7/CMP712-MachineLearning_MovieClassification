- Good.

are that way, Mexico's that way,

Don't worry about the rest.
You'll never see it through the smog.

00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:32,913
Maybe you better check and see
if Joe's okay back there.

537
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:10,077
All right.
I'm a little confused, O'Hara,

- Hello, Harry. Hiya, gorgeous.
- Welcome back, Gregg.

you requested no fire hoses
and no restraints of any kind.

- Come on, let me introduce you.
- Well, how are we supposed
to control this animal?

- With a giant rolled-up newspaper? Hi.
- Jill Young, I'd like you...

you met Joe.

I know it looks small,
but this is just the entrance.

- Okay.

hose you guys down too?

- [ Jill ] No, no, no.

than a legend,
