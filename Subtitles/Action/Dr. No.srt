<i>¶¶ Three blind mice in a row</i>

2
00:02:31,429 --> 00:02:33,920
<i>¶¶ Three blind mice, there they go</i>

3
00:02:34,057 --> 00:02:36,597
<i>¶¶ Marching down the street, single file</i>

00:02:36,728 --> 00:02:38,852

the attitude of three blind mice</i>

12
00:03:03,047 --> 00:03:05,086

<i>¶¶ Oh, the mice...</i>

17
00:03:18,194 --> 00:03:21,197
<i>That's it. 100 honours, and 90 below.</i>

18
00:03:21,324 --> 00:03:24,112
<i>Nicely done, Strangways.
I have to give it to you.</i>

19
00:03:24,245 --> 00:03:28,375
<i>I must leave you for a few minutes.
Order a round on my chit, Professor.</i>

20
00:03:28,502 --> 00:03:29,451
<i>Right.</i>

21
00:03:29,587 --> 00:03:32,459
<i>Damn it all!
Must you always break off at this time?</i>

22
00:03:32,591 --> 00:03:37,504
<i>My managing director's a creature of
habit. I get a call every day at this time.</i>

23
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:39,681
<i>Hurry back before the cards get cold.</i>

24
00:03:39,811 --> 00:03:43,182
<i>20 minutes. And don't doctor
any hands for me while I'm away.</i>

25
00:03:45,278 --> 00:03:46,773
<i>Same again.</i>

26
00:03:49,325 --> 00:03:51,034
<i>Bless you, master.</i>

27
00:04:06,353 --> 00:04:09,687
<i>- Hurry, man! Hurry!
- Get away, quick!</i>

28
00:04:28,552 --> 00:04:32,339
<i>W6N... W6N... W6N.</i>

29
00:04:32,476 --> 00:04:34,884
<i>Calling G7W.</i>

30
00:04:35,021 --> 00:04:37,062
<i>How do you hear me? Over.</i>

31
00:04:37,943 --> 00:04:42,156
<i>G7W London. G7WLondon.
Receiving you. Over. </i>

32
00:04:43,409 --> 00:04:44,987
<i>Stand by to transmit.</i>

33
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,365
<i>Wait. Out.</i>

34
00:05:09,074 --> 00:05:10,735
<i>Here.</i>

35
00:05:35,739 --> 00:05:37,982
<i>Hello, W6N. Report my signals.</i>

36
00:05:38,118 --> 00:05:40,907
<i>Report my signals. Over.</i>

37
00:05:41,041 --> 00:05:43,115
<i>Hello, W6N. Over.</i>

38
00:05:48,593 --> 00:05:50,920
<i>Foreman of signals-urgent.</i>

39
00:05:56,563 --> 00:05:59,056
<i>Get me the Ml6 radio security control.</i>

40
00:06:00,111 --> 00:06:01,356
<i>What is it?</i>

41
00:06:01,488 --> 00:06:05,357
<i>W6N, Jamaica. Broken contact, sir,
during a routine transmission.</i>

42
00:06:05,494 --> 00:06:06,443
<i>Broken or faded?</i>

43
00:06:06,579 --> 00:06:09,202
<i>Broken.
The carrier wave is still established.</i>

44
00:06:09,333 --> 00:06:13,499
<i>- And the emergency frequencies?
- No joy on either. I'm still calling.</i>

45
00:06:13,632 --> 00:06:15,922
<i>Keep trying.
Let me know when they come up.</i>

46
00:06:16,052 --> 00:06:20,718
<i>Hello, W6N? W6N?
Report my signals. Over.</i>

47
00:06:20,852 --> 00:06:24,897
<i>Foreman of signals, sir.
Jamaica's broken off mid-transmission.</i>

48
00:06:25,024 --> 00:06:27,397
<i>No, sir. It's not a technical fault.</i>

49
00:06:27,528 --> 00:06:29,320
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

50
00:06:29,448 --> 00:06:30,991
<i>Will you tell him, sir?</i>

51
00:06:31,117 --> 00:06:32,577
<i>Very good.</i>

52
00:06:39,032 --> 00:06:42,652
<i>- Excuse me, sir. Are you a member?
- No, I'm looking for Mr James Bond.</i>

53
00:06:42,788 --> 00:06:46,574
<i>- What name should I say, sir?
- Just give him my card, will you?</i>

54
00:06:46,711 --> 00:06:49,796
<i>Would you like to leave your coat
over there, sir?</i>

55
00:07:01,651 --> 00:07:03,145
<i>200,000 à la banque. </i>

56
00:07:03,278 --> 00:07:04,822
<i>- Suivi.
- Suivi. </i>

57
00:07:06,199 --> 00:07:08,074
<i>- Carte.
- Carte. </i>

58
00:07:12,625 --> 00:07:14,666
<i>Sept à la banque. </i>

59
00:07:15,631 --> 00:07:17,007
<i>200,000 à la banque. </i>

60
00:07:17,550 --> 00:07:19,591
<i>- Suivi.
- Banco suivi. </i>

61
00:07:27,482 --> 00:07:29,772
<i>- Carte.
- Carte. </i>

62
00:07:29,903 --> 00:07:31,730
<i>Huit à la banque. </i>

63
00:07:32,406 --> 00:07:33,783
<i>- Suivi.
- C'est suivi. </i>

64
00:07:33,909 --> 00:07:38,157
<i>- The house will cover the difference?
- Oui, madame. Changeur, s'il vous plaît. </i>

65
00:07:43,673 --> 00:07:45,714
<i>- Carte.
- Carte. </i>

66
00:07:47,429 --> 00:07:50,634
<i>- Neuf à la banque.
- I need another thousand.</i>

67
00:07:50,767 --> 00:07:53,177
<i>I admire your courage, Miss... uh...?</i>

68
00:07:53,313 --> 00:07:56,270
<i>Trench. Sylvia Trench.</i>

69
00:07:56,610 --> 00:07:59,103
<i>I admire your luck, Mr...?</i>

70
00:08:00,074 --> 00:08:01,902
<i>Bond.</i>

71
00:08:02,036 --> 00:08:03,530
<i>James Bond.</i>

72
00:08:03,662 --> 00:08:07,995
<i>Mr Bond, I suppose you wouldn't
care to... um... raise the limit?</i>

73
00:08:08,129 --> 00:08:09,409
<i>I have no objections.</i>

74
00:08:09,547 --> 00:08:12,633
<i>Pas possible, madame. Ce n'est pas légal. </i>

75
00:08:13,470 --> 00:08:15,428
<i>- Now.
- C'est suivi, monsieur. </i>

76
00:08:19,897 --> 00:08:21,724
<i>Looks like you're out to get me.</i>

77
00:08:22,399 --> 00:08:24,441
<i>It's an idea, at that.</i>

78
00:08:25,363 --> 00:08:27,986
<i>- Eight.
- Huit à la banque. </i>

79
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:31,201
<i>Neuf à la banque. </i>

80
00:08:31,331 --> 00:08:33,788
<i>- Excuse me, sir.
- Thank you.</i>

81
00:08:34,626 --> 00:08:36,751
<i>André, I must pass the shoe.</i>

82
00:08:36,881 --> 00:08:39,670
<i>I hope you'll forgive me,
but it's most important.</i>

83
00:08:39,801 --> 00:08:41,427
<i>Thank you.</i>

84
00:08:45,185 --> 00:08:47,225
<i>Have those changed, will you?</i>

85
00:08:51,738 --> 00:08:55,985
<i>Too bad you have to go.
Just as things were getting interesting.</i>

86
00:08:56,118 --> 00:08:57,864
<i>Yes.</i>

87
00:08:57,996 --> 00:09:03,160
<i>Tell me, Miss Trench, do you play any
other games? Besides chemin de fer? </i>

88
00:09:03,298 --> 00:09:05,089
<i>Hmm. Golf,</i>

89
00:09:05,217 --> 00:09:07,257
<i>amongst other things.</i>

90
00:09:07,469 --> 00:09:10,722
<i>- Tomorrow afternoon, then.
- Tomorrow? Let me see...</i>

91
00:09:11,101 --> 00:09:14,387
<i>And, uh, we could have dinner
afterwards, perhaps?</i>

92
00:09:14,522 --> 00:09:16,563
<i>Sounds tempting.</i>

93
00:09:17,319 --> 00:09:19,110
<i>May I, um,</i>

94
00:09:19,237 --> 00:09:21,030
<i>let you know in the morning?</i>

95
00:09:21,157 --> 00:09:23,198
<i>Splendid.</i>

96
00:09:23,870 --> 00:09:25,910
<i>My number's on the card.</i>

97
00:09:43,067 --> 00:09:45,107
<i>See if he's there, will you?</i>

98
00:09:47,407 --> 00:09:52,036
<i>James, where on earth have you been?
I've been searching London for you!</i>

99
00:09:53,332 --> 00:09:55,373
<i>007 is here, sir.</i>

100
00:09:55,752 --> 00:09:57,792
<i>He'll see you in a minute.</i>

101
00:09:57,922 --> 00:09:59,963
<i>Moneypenny!</i>

102
00:10:00,302 --> 00:10:01,334
<i>What gives?</i>

103
00:10:01,470 --> 00:10:04,009
<i>Me. Given an ounce of encouragement.</i>

104
00:10:04,850 --> 00:10:08,436
<i>You never take me to dinner
looking like this, James.</i>

105
00:10:08,564 --> 00:10:10,556
<i>You never take me to dinner. Period.</i>

106
00:10:10,692 --> 00:10:14,823
<i>I would, you know. Only M
would have me court-martialled for</i>

107
00:10:14,949 --> 00:10:17,238
<i>illegal use of government property.</i>

108
00:10:17,368 --> 00:10:21,072
<i>Flattery will get you nowhere.
But don't stop trying.</i>

109
00:10:21,209 --> 00:10:24,294
<i>- Now...
- What's all this to-do about?</i>

110
00:10:24,421 --> 00:10:26,249
<i>Strangways. And it looks serious.</i>

111
00:10:26,383 --> 00:10:29,920
<i>We've been burning the air between
here and Jamaica for three hours.</i>

112
00:10:30,890 --> 00:10:31,840
<i>Oh. In you go.</i>

113
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,601
<i>Don't forget to write.</i>

114
00:10:48,996 --> 00:10:50,872
<i>Good evening, sir.</i>

115
00:10:50,999 --> 00:10:53,040
<i>It happens to be 3am.</i>

116
00:10:53,170 --> 00:10:55,210
<i>When do you sleep, 007?</i>

117
00:10:55,547 --> 00:10:57,589
<i>Never on the firm's time, sir.</i>

118
00:10:58,052 --> 00:11:00,093
<i>Sit down.</i>

119
00:11:03,768 --> 00:11:06,143
<i>Jamaica went off the air tonight,</i>

120
00:11:06,272 --> 00:11:09,442
<i>in the middle of the opening procedure.
We've checked and...</i>

121
00:11:09,570 --> 00:11:11,896
<i>Strangways has disappeared.</i>

122
00:11:12,032 --> 00:11:15,782
<i>So has his secretary.
A new girl. We'd only just sent her out.</i>

123
00:11:15,913 --> 00:11:18,869
<i>Was Strangways on something... special?</i>

124
00:11:19,001 --> 00:11:21,458
<i>He was checking
an enquiry from the Americans.</i>

125
00:11:21,588 --> 00:11:26,003
<i>They complained about interference
with their Cape Canaveral rockets.</i>

126
00:11:26,136 --> 00:11:29,009
<i>They think it comes
from the Jamaica area.</i>

127
00:11:29,976 --> 00:11:33,596
<i>- Does "toppling" mean anything to you?
- A little.</i>

128
00:11:33,732 --> 00:11:37,946
<i>It's throwing the gyroscopic controls
of a guided missile off balance with a...</i>

129
00:11:38,072 --> 00:11:39,899
<i>a radio beam or something.</i>

130
00:11:40,033 --> 00:11:45,242
<i>Five million dollars' worth of missile
aimed at a spot in the South Atlantic,</i>

131
00:11:45,374 --> 00:11:48,912
<i>but finishing up in the Brazilian jungle,
is bad enough.</i>

132
00:11:49,048 --> 00:11:53,214
<i>Now they're gonna try orbiting a rocket
round the moon.</i>

133
00:11:53,721 --> 00:11:57,258
<i>The American CIA sent a man down
to work with Strangways.</i>

134
00:11:57,894 --> 00:12:02,107
<i>- A fellow called Leiter. Do you know him?
- I've heard of him. Never met him.</i>

135
00:12:02,235 --> 00:12:04,773
<i>Has he found out anything important?</i>

136
00:12:04,905 --> 00:12:08,525
<i>Better ask him.  You're booked
on the 7 o'clock plane to Kingston.</i>

137
00:12:08,661 --> 00:12:12,577
<i>That gives you exactly
three hours, 22 minutes.</i>

138
00:12:13,209 --> 00:12:15,250
<i>Armourer.</i>

139
00:12:15,504 --> 00:12:20,846
<i>You'll get a set of background papers
at the airport, in a self-destructor bag.</i>

140
00:12:21,139 --> 00:12:23,677
<i>You can study them during the flight.</i>

141
00:12:23,809 --> 00:12:26,384
<i>I want to know
what's happened to Strangways.</i>

142
00:12:28,025 --> 00:12:29,684
<i>Sir.</i>

143
00:12:31,195 --> 00:12:33,236
<i>Take off your jacket.</i>

144
00:12:38,957 --> 00:12:40,998
<i>Give me your gun.</i>

145
00:12:43,923 --> 00:12:48,256
<i>Yes, I thought so. This damn Beretta
again. I've told you about this before.</i>

146
00:12:48,387 --> 00:12:51,226
<i>You tell him-for the last time.</i>

147
00:12:52,938 --> 00:12:55,975
<i>Nice and light-in a lady's handbag.</i>

148
00:12:56,651 --> 00:12:58,231
<i>No stopping power.</i>

149
00:12:58,363 --> 00:13:00,404
<i>Any comments, 007?</i>

150
00:13:01,743 --> 00:13:03,403
<i>I disagree, sir.</i>

151
00:13:03,537 --> 00:13:07,288
<i>I've used a Beretta for ten years.
I've never missed with it yet.</i>

152
00:13:07,418 --> 00:13:11,750
<i>Maybe not, but it jammed on your last job
and you spent six months in hospital.</i>

153
00:13:11,884 --> 00:13:16,132
<i>A double-O number means you're
licensed to kill, not get killed.</i>

154
00:13:16,265 --> 00:13:17,464
<i>And another thing.</i>

155
00:13:17,601 --> 00:13:21,933
<i>Since I've been head of Ml6, there's been
a 40% drop in double-O casualties.</i>

156
00:13:22,065 --> 00:13:25,317
<i>I want it to stay that way.
You'll carry the Walther.</i>

157
00:13:25,864 --> 00:13:29,566
<i>Unless you'd prefer to go back
to standard intelligence duties?</i>

158
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:33,239
<i>No, sir. I would not.</i>

159
00:13:33,374 --> 00:13:37,839
<i>Then from now on you carry
a different gun. Show him, armourer.</i>

160
00:13:38,008 --> 00:13:43,432
<i>Walther PPK. 7.65mm with a delivery
like a brick through a plate-glass window.</i>

161
00:13:44,602 --> 00:13:48,386
<i>Takes a Brausch silencer,
with little reduction in muzzle velocity.</i>

162
00:13:48,523 --> 00:13:50,102
<i>The American CIA swear by them.</i>

163
00:13:50,234 --> 00:13:53,320
<i>- Thank you, Major Boothroyd.
- Thank you, sir.</i>

164
00:13:54,158 --> 00:13:56,234
<i>- Any questions, 007?
- No, sir.</i>

165
00:13:56,369 --> 00:13:58,113
<i>All right, then. Best of luck.</i>

166
00:13:58,245 --> 00:14:00,286
<i>Thank you, sir.</i>

167
00:14:04,006 --> 00:14:05,001
<i>007!</i>

168
00:14:05,716 --> 00:14:08,470
<i>- Sir?
- Just leave the Beretta.</i>

169
00:14:27,166 --> 00:14:31,877
<i>Miss Moneypenny, forget the usual
repartee. 007's in a hurry. </i>

170
00:14:41,397 --> 00:14:43,437
<i>Ciao.</i>

171
00:14:43,817 --> 00:14:45,858
<i>Good luck.</i>

172
00:15:25,701 --> 00:15:28,573
<i>There! Now you made me miss it.</i>

173
00:15:29,207 --> 00:15:31,116
<i>You don't miss a thing.</i>

174
00:15:31,251 --> 00:15:33,708
<i>How did you get in here?</i>

175
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:36,249
<i>I decided to accept your invitation.</i>

176
00:15:38,305 --> 00:15:40,594
<i>That was for tomorrow afternoon.</i>

177
00:15:41,141 --> 00:15:44,014
<i>Tell me...
Do you always dress this way for golf?</i>

178
00:15:44,147 --> 00:15:48,277
<i>I changed into something more
comfortable. I hope I did the right thing.</i>

179
00:15:48,403 --> 00:15:50,398
<i>You did the right thing,</i>

180
00:15:50,531 --> 00:15:53,948
<i>but you picked the wrong moment.
I have to leave immediately.</i>

181
00:15:54,078 --> 00:15:56,405
<i>Oh, that's too bad.</i>

182
00:15:57,334 --> 00:16:00,620
<i>Just as things were
getting interesting again.</i>

183
00:16:05,887 --> 00:16:08,463
<i>When did you say you had to leave?</i>

184
00:16:09,644 --> 00:16:11,685
<i>Immediately.</i>

185
00:16:14,151 --> 00:16:16,192
<i>Almost immediately.</i>

186
00:16:26,962 --> 00:16:30,748
<i>Hello, New York. Your Pan-Am 323
just landed - Kingston, Jamaica.</i>

187
00:16:35,726 --> 00:16:39,097
<i>Would passengers
please go to terminal four? </i>

188
00:16:58,230 --> 00:17:00,189
<i>Taxi!</i>

189
00:17:00,316 --> 00:17:01,942
<i>All right, then. Go ahead.</i>

190
00:17:02,070 --> 00:17:04,109
<i>Help yourself.</i>

191
00:17:04,823 --> 00:17:07,577
<i>- Taxi!
- Mr... Bond, sir?</i>

192
00:17:08,246 --> 00:17:09,657
<i>Yes?</i>

193
00:17:09,788 --> 00:17:13,206
<i>I'm Mr Jones-chauffeur from
Government House, sent to get you.</i>

194
00:17:13,336 --> 00:17:16,504
<i>Fine. You can drop my luggage
at the hotel on the way.</i>

195
00:17:16,633 --> 00:17:19,636
<i>- Hang on, I want to check my reservation.
- I can do that.</i>

196
00:17:19,762 --> 00:17:22,302
<i>No, no. You just take care of the bags.</i>

197
00:17:41,546 --> 00:17:43,540
<i>- Government House?
- Yes. </i>

198
00:17:43,674 --> 00:17:47,544
<i>- Principal Secretary, please.
- Hold the line, please. </i>

199
00:17:51,145 --> 00:17:54,313
<i>- Who wants him?
- James Bond. Universal Exports.</i>

200
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:56,775
<i>Welcome to Jamaica, Mr Bond.</i>

201
00:17:57,363 --> 00:18:00,199
<i>Yes, your head office
alerted us this morning.</i>

202
00:18:00,325 --> 00:18:04,575
<i>- Are you free for lunch at one o'clock?
- One o'clock suits me fine.</i>

203
00:18:04,708 --> 00:18:08,493
<i>- Have you sent a car for me?
- No, I didn't think you'd want one. </i>

204
00:18:08,630 --> 00:18:10,708
<i>Quite right. One o'clock, then.</i>

205
00:18:11,468 --> 00:18:14,174
<i>Forgive me if I'm... a few minutes late.</i>

206
00:18:31,123 --> 00:18:32,951
<i>Thank you.</i>

207
00:18:33,084 --> 00:18:36,621
<i>- Where to first, sir?
- Government House, but I'm in no hurry.</i>

208
00:18:36,757 --> 00:18:39,295
<i>Just, uh... take me for a ride.</i>

209
00:19:09,306 --> 00:19:12,724
<i>Do you always drive this fast?
I told you I wasn't in a hurry.</i>

210
00:19:12,854 --> 00:19:16,723
<i>Sorry, sir, but I think there's
some fellow trying to follow us.</i>

211
00:19:21,033 --> 00:19:23,489
<i>Then I suggest you... try and lose them.</i>

212
00:19:43,651 --> 00:19:45,692
<i>Take the next turning on the right.</i>

213
00:20:03,181 --> 00:20:04,558
<i>Now, Mr Jones.</i>

214
00:20:04,684 --> 00:20:07,804
<i>Talk fast,
before your friend doubles back.</i>

215
00:20:08,106 --> 00:20:10,146
<i>Who are you working for?</i>

216
00:20:10,526 --> 00:20:13,445
<i>I... don't know what you're talking about.</i>

217
00:20:13,573 --> 00:20:17,074
<i>- I was just sent to meet you at the airport.
- Ah, but by whom?</i>

218
00:20:17,204 --> 00:20:19,362
<i>By...</i>

219
00:20:19,499 --> 00:20:21,242
<i>- Government House.
- I don't think so.</i>

220
00:20:21,376 --> 00:20:25,756
<i>Both hands on the wheel, Mr Jones.
I'm a very nervous passenger.</i>

221
00:20:26,509 --> 00:20:28,549
<i>Get out-move!</i>

222
00:20:29,556 --> 00:20:32,012
<i>Keep your hands where I can see them.</i>

223
00:20:56,598 --> 00:20:58,638
<i>Get up!</i>

224
00:21:10,953 --> 00:21:13,161
<i>- Now talk.
- All right.</i>

225
00:21:13,290 --> 00:21:14,286
<i>All right.</i>

226
00:21:17,379 --> 00:21:19,420
<i>Let me have a cigarette.</i>

227
00:21:33,279 --> 00:21:35,652
<i>To hell with you!</i>

228
00:21:58,609 --> 00:22:01,397
<i>Sergeant, make sure he doesn't get away.</i>

229
00:22:06,748 --> 00:22:09,157
<i>Tut-tut-tut. Cyanide in a cigarette?</i>

230
00:22:09,418 --> 00:22:12,457
<i>- Fantastic!
- No less.</i>

231
00:22:12,590 --> 00:22:14,168
<i>Duff, what have you got for us?</i>

232
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:18,432
<i>The car was stolen and we haven't
been able to identify the driver yet.</i>

233
00:22:18,933 --> 00:22:20,891
<i>But he surely wasn't a Kingston man.</i>

234
00:22:21,019 --> 00:22:23,892
<i>Wherever he was from,
news of my arrival leaked.</i>

235
00:22:24,024 --> 00:22:28,154
<i>- We didn't advertise it, I can assure you.
- Perhaps not.</i>

236
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:31,568
<i>I got the impression
someone had been selling tickets.</i>

237
00:22:31,702 --> 00:22:33,742
<i>Anything more we can do for you?</i>

238
00:22:33,872 --> 00:22:36,793
<i>I'd like to meet the last people
to see Strangways.</i>

239
00:22:36,919 --> 00:22:40,455
<i>Nobody seems to have seen him
after he left our bridge four.</i>

240
00:22:40,591 --> 00:22:42,632
<i>- Who were the others?
- Professor Dent...</i>

241
00:22:42,761 --> 00:22:46,547
<i>Metallurgist, runs a test laboratory.
Respected. Clean bill.</i>

242
00:22:46,684 --> 00:22:50,637
<i>- Potter...
- Old general. Been here for ages.</i>

243
00:22:50,775 --> 00:22:52,233
<i>We'll start with those.</i>

244
00:22:52,358 --> 00:22:55,612
<i>- Want them brought in?
- Lord, no! I want to meet them socially.</i>

245
00:22:55,740 --> 00:22:57,817
<i>I can introduce you at the club tonight.</i>

246
00:22:57,951 --> 00:23:00,740
<i>Fine.
We'll take a look at Strangways' place.</i>

247
00:23:00,873 --> 00:23:02,914
<i>I'll run you up there now.</i>

248
00:23:15,436 --> 00:23:17,144
<i>Go on in.</i>

249
00:23:22,864 --> 00:23:24,904
<i>Yes, that's her blood patch.</i>

250
00:23:25,283 --> 00:23:30,530
<i>- They've grouped it as O Rh positive.
- That's her group all right.</i>

251
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:42,677
<i>The set was still switched on
when we came round.</i>

252
00:23:42,810 --> 00:23:45,849
<i>We tried to get through,
but it was dead the other end.</i>

253
00:23:45,983 --> 00:23:51,656
<i>And it'll stay dead. All frequencies are
changed immediately security's broken.</i>

254
00:23:58,335 --> 00:24:00,626
<i>Receipt from Dent Laboratories.</i>

255
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:03,881
<i>Is geology a hobby of Strangways'?</i>

256
00:24:04,011 --> 00:24:06,550
<i>Not that I know of, no.</i>

257
00:24:12,899 --> 00:24:15,023
<i>Who's the man with Strangways?</i>

258
00:24:17,448 --> 00:24:19,490
<i>One of the local fishermen.</i>

259
00:24:19,618 --> 00:24:24,034
<i>- He drove the car that tailed me.
- That gives us something to work on.</i>

260
00:24:24,167 --> 00:24:26,161
<i>I'll have him checked.</i>

261
00:24:26,296 --> 00:24:30,841
<i>You do that. I want to change before
I meet Pleydell-Smith at the club.</i>

262
00:24:37,223 --> 00:24:41,769
<i>One medium-dry vodka martini -
mixed like you said, sir, and not stirred.</i>

263
00:24:41,896 --> 00:24:44,520
<i>- Anything else, sir?
- No, that's all.</i>

264
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:07,274
<i>Curious, old Strangways
just vanishing like that. Or is it?</i>

265
00:26:07,404 --> 00:26:10,692
<i>Cherchez la femme.
His secretary was very nice indeed.</i>

266
00:26:10,826 --> 00:26:12,951
<i>Did you know her?</i>

267
00:26:13,081 --> 00:26:15,488
<i>I've seen her around, you know?</i>

268
00:26:15,625 --> 00:26:18,996
<i>None of you can throw any light
on what happened to him?</i>

269
00:26:19,131 --> 00:26:21,207
<i>In his conversation? Any hint?</i>

270
00:26:22,803 --> 00:26:26,388
<i>I only heard him talk about
big game fishing and bridge.</i>

271
00:26:26,517 --> 00:26:28,261
<i>Fishing was the latest craze.</i>

272
00:26:28,394 --> 00:26:31,731
<i>He got the bug three weeks ago.
He's been out every day.</i>

273
00:26:31,859 --> 00:26:33,484
<i>It must have cost something.</i>

274
00:26:33,611 --> 00:26:38,026
<i>These fishermen ask the earth to charter,
and Quarrel's the most expensive.</i>

275
00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:39,074
<i>Quarrel?</i>

276
00:26:39,204 --> 00:26:41,778
<i>A Cayman Islander.
He keeps a boat in the harbour.</i>

277
00:26:41,916 --> 00:26:42,450
<i>I see.</i>

278
00:26:53,353 --> 00:26:56,439
<i>- Excuse me. Where do I find Quarrel?
- He him.</i>

279
00:26:56,566 --> 00:26:57,563
<i>Thank you.</i>

280
00:27:08,334 --> 00:27:10,375
<i>Is your name Quarrel?</i>

281
00:27:11,298 --> 00:27:12,709
<i>Maybe.</i>

282
00:27:12,841 --> 00:27:14,752
<i>I'm a friend of...</i>

283
00:27:14,886 --> 00:27:17,129
<i>Commander Strangways.</i>

284
00:27:18,809 --> 00:27:23,224
<i>Now ain't that nice!
I like people who's friends of people.</i>

285
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:27,352
<i>I thought you might be able
to tell me what happened to him.</i>

286
00:27:28,366 --> 00:27:30,739
<i>As far as I know, nothing happened.</i>

287
00:27:31,077 --> 00:27:33,866
<i>Unless you know... different, Captain.</i>

288
00:27:34,834 --> 00:27:37,207
<i>Where did you take him in your boat?</i>

289
00:27:38,172 --> 00:27:40,166
<i>You see that, Captain?</i>

290
00:27:40,301 --> 00:27:42,342
<i>That there's the Caribbean.</i>

291
00:27:43,055 --> 00:27:44,514
<i>That's where.</i>

292
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:45,886
<i>Fishing.</i>

293
00:27:46,018 --> 00:27:49,685
<i>I'm interested in fishing.
I'd like to charter your boat.</i>

294
00:27:49,816 --> 00:27:51,892
<i>I'm sorry, Captain. It's not for hire.</i>

295
00:27:52,026 --> 00:27:54,484
<i>It seems I came to the wrong address.</i>

296
00:27:54,614 --> 00:27:59,778
<i>That's all right, Captain. Now, if you'll
excuse me, I got business to attend to.</i>

297
00:28:33,300 --> 00:28:35,340
<i>Hey, Pussfeller.</i>

298
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:59,202
<i>Well, if it ain't my friend
what gets addresses mixed!</i>

299
00:29:00,049 --> 00:29:02,588
<i>You got the right one,
if you likes good eating.</i>

300
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:06,386
<i>I do, if the... conversation matches it.</i>

301
00:29:06,934 --> 00:29:08,975
<i>Back at the boat too public.</i>

302
00:29:09,355 --> 00:29:12,725
<i>- In there it different.
- Well, after you.</i>

303
00:29:13,736 --> 00:29:15,777
<i>Sure thing.</i>

304
00:29:19,286 --> 00:29:22,871
<i>- Hey, man! See we get a bit of privacy.
- Nothing but, Quarrel. Nothing but.</i>

305
00:29:31,992 --> 00:29:34,781
<i>- Take a seat.
- No, I'm fine.</i>

306
00:29:35,707 --> 00:29:39,291
<i>OK, mister.
Supposing you start the conversation.</i>

307
00:29:39,503 --> 00:29:41,544
<i>Now how's about it?</i>

308
00:29:50,730 --> 00:29:54,813
<i>Ain't no use you struggling.
Pussfeller wrestles alligators.</i>

309
00:30:02,247 --> 00:30:04,953
<i>Right. Up slowly and face that wall.</i>

310
00:30:14,601 --> 00:30:16,640
<i>Hold it.</i>

311
00:30:21,110 --> 00:30:23,150
<i>Gently, bud. Gently.</i>

312
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:25,529
<i>Let's not get excited.</i>

313
00:30:29,581 --> 00:30:30,612
<i>Frisk him.</i>

314
00:30:43,854 --> 00:30:45,894
<i>Nothing.</i>

315
00:30:46,691 --> 00:30:49,730
<i>Interesting.
Where were you measured for this?</i>

316
00:30:49,863 --> 00:30:51,858
<i>My tailor. Savile Row.</i>

317
00:30:51,991 --> 00:30:54,614
<i>Is that so? Mine's a guy in Washington.</i>

318
00:30:55,329 --> 00:30:58,451
<i>Felix Leiter. Central Intelligence Agency.</i>

319
00:30:58,628 --> 00:31:00,666
<i>You must be James Bond.</i>

320
00:31:00,963 --> 00:31:05,629
<i>- You mean we're fighting the same war?
- Yeah. I spotted you at the airport, but...</i>

321
00:31:05,763 --> 00:31:09,548
<i>when you left with the opposition
I figured I must be wrong.</i>

322
00:31:09,685 --> 00:31:11,181
<i>Quarrel's been helping me.</i>

323
00:31:11,313 --> 00:31:14,648
<i>- No hard feelings, I hope?
- Glad to know you, Mr Bond.</i>

324
00:31:14,775 --> 00:31:16,735
<i>Pussfeller owns the place.</i>

325
00:31:16,862 --> 00:31:21,326
<i>- I hope he cooks better than he fights!
- Nobody died from my cooking-yet!</i>

326
00:31:21,453 --> 00:31:24,125
<i>¶¶ Down Kingston town, you know,
all the people go jump up</i>

327
00:31:24,250 --> 00:31:26,077
<i>¶¶ Wavin' arms about, leapin' in and out</i>

328
00:31:26,209 --> 00:31:28,038
<i>¶¶ It's so easy to jump up</i>

329
00:31:28,172 --> 00:31:29,965
<i>¶¶ Take a pretty girl, take a whirl</i>

330
00:31:30,092 --> 00:31:31,920
<i>¶¶ And then do it again, again jump up</i>

331
00:31:32,054 --> 00:31:34,806
<i>¶¶ Hold her very tight,
then for all the night</i>

332
00:31:34,932 --> 00:31:35,714
<i>¶¶ Jump up</i>

333
00:31:35,851 --> 00:31:37,394
<i>¶¶ Jump up, jump up</i>

334
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:39,264
<i>¶¶ Jamaica jump up, jump up</i>

335
00:31:39,397 --> 00:31:41,308
<i>¶¶ Jamaica jump-up music</i>

336
00:31:41,443 --> 00:31:43,769
<i>¶¶ Jamaica never want to stop jump-up</i>

337
00:31:43,905 --> 00:31:45,530
<i>¶¶ Jump up, jump up</i>

338
00:31:45,658 --> 00:31:47,318
<i>¶¶ Jamaica jump up, jump up</i>

339
00:31:47,452 --> 00:31:49,492
<i>¶¶ Jamaica jump-up music</i>

340
00:31:49,622 --> 00:31:51,662
<i>¶¶ Jamaica never want to stop jump-up</i>

341
00:31:59,582 --> 00:32:01,327
<i>Cape Canaveral is screaming.</i>

342
00:32:01,460 --> 00:32:04,961
<i>With this moon rocket launch,
they don't want anything to go wrong.</i>

343
00:32:05,090 --> 00:32:08,758
<i>And Strangways didn't think
the interference came from here?</i>

344
00:32:08,889 --> 00:32:10,929
<i>I suppose you cased the joint?</i>

345
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:13,642
<i>I checked-unofficially.</i>

346
00:32:14,062 --> 00:32:16,899
<i>You Limeys can be touchy
about trespassing.</i>

347
00:32:17,025 --> 00:32:19,814
<i>Strangways and Quarrel
checked the offshore islands.</i>

348
00:32:19,947 --> 00:32:21,775
<i>- You found nothing?
- Not a thing.</i>

349
00:32:21,908 --> 00:32:24,780
<i>- Where did you look?
- Just about most everywhere.</i>

350
00:32:25,205 --> 00:32:28,041
<i>Fire Island, Crab Key, Morgan's Reef.</i>

351
00:32:28,168 --> 00:32:29,331
<i>Checked them all?</i>

352
00:32:29,461 --> 00:32:32,548
<i>All except Crab Key.
We didn't have no right to go there.</i>

353
00:32:32,675 --> 00:32:34,918
<i>- Why not?
- It belongs to a Chinese...</i>

354
00:32:37,766 --> 00:32:40,056
<i>Get her, Quarrel-and the camera.</i>

355
00:32:44,610 --> 00:32:46,438
<i>Evening, missis.</i>

356
00:32:48,783 --> 00:32:50,492
<i>You're hurting!</i>

357
00:32:50,619 --> 00:32:53,657
<i>The Captain wants you
to have a drink with us.</i>

358
00:32:54,793 --> 00:32:56,204
<i>You're hurting me!</i>

359
00:32:56,335 --> 00:32:58,377
<i>You can't mean it.</i>

360
00:33:06,603 --> 00:33:07,598
<i>Good evening.</i>

361
00:33:13,531 --> 00:33:15,903
<i>Why do you want another picture of me?</i>

362
00:33:16,033 --> 00:33:18,608
<i>Because I only got your hat at the airport.</i>

363
00:33:18,746 --> 00:33:22,447
<i>- Tell this ape to let me go!
- Why do you want a picture at all?</i>

364
00:33:22,584 --> 00:33:25,043
<i>Because that's the way I earn my living.</i>

365
00:33:26,133 --> 00:33:29,753
<i>- Who pays you?
- Oh... The Daily Gleaner! </i>

366
00:33:31,724 --> 00:33:33,765
<i>Pussfeller! Pussfeller!</i>

367
00:33:36,064 --> 00:33:38,522
<i>- Anything I can do?
- Ever seen this girl before?</i>

368
00:33:38,651 --> 00:33:40,277
<i>She come here sometimes.</i>

369
00:33:40,404 --> 00:33:44,357
<i>She being a nuisance to you?
You want for me to get rid of her?</i>

370
00:33:44,495 --> 00:33:49,040
<i>No. Just ring the Gleaner.  Find out
if they sent a photographer here tonight.</i>

371
00:33:50,211 --> 00:33:52,334
<i>They didn't send me. I work freelance.</i>

372
00:33:52,506 --> 00:33:55,045
<i>Freelance, hm? For whom?</i>

373
00:33:55,678 --> 00:33:56,876
<i>You...!</i>

374
00:33:58,139 --> 00:33:59,800
<i>Tell us and he'll stop.</i>

375
00:34:07,112 --> 00:34:11,408
<i>We don't get nothing out of this gal.
You want for me to break her arm?</i>

376
00:34:11,535 --> 00:34:12,532
<i>Another time.</i>

377
00:34:17,878 --> 00:34:21,546
<i>The second time nothing's come out.
Give her her arm back.</i>

378
00:34:22,594 --> 00:34:24,635
<i>Run along, Freelance.</i>

379
00:34:24,888 --> 00:34:28,260
<i>You'll be sorry.
You'll all be sorry, you rats!</i>

380
00:34:33,361 --> 00:34:38,109
<i>One takes cyanide, another would have
had her arm broken. Neither would talk.</i>

381
00:34:38,244 --> 00:34:43,203
<i>- Who puts that sort of scare into people?
- I think we'd better find out, but fast.</i>

382
00:34:43,459 --> 00:34:46,333
<i>You mentioned Crab Key.
Why can't we go over there?</i>

383
00:34:46,465 --> 00:34:50,594
<i>It belongs to a Chinese character.
He won't allow anyone to land.</i>

384
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:53,843
<i>Our naval reconnaissance planes
took a look.</i>

385
00:34:53,976 --> 00:34:56,017
<i>They only found a bauxite mine.</i>

386
00:34:56,146 --> 00:34:58,187
<i>Low-scan CH radar setup.</i>

387
00:34:58,317 --> 00:35:00,275
<i>Nothing illegal about that.</i>

388
00:35:00,404 --> 00:35:02,895
<i>That Crab Key scares me plenty.</i>

389
00:35:03,574 --> 00:35:06,530
<i>Friends of mine went out there once
after seashells.</i>

390
00:35:06,662 --> 00:35:09,035
<i>Only trouble, they never came back again.</i>

391
00:35:09,166 --> 00:35:11,623
<i>Local fishermen won't go near it.</i>

392
00:35:11,753 --> 00:35:13,831
<i>Strangways and me slip in at night.</i>

393
00:35:13,965 --> 00:35:16,374
<i>He take samples, we came straight back.</i>

394
00:35:16,512 --> 00:35:19,300
<i>- Don't do to hang about there.
- What kind of samples?</i>

395
00:35:19,725 --> 00:35:23,095
<i>Oh, bits of rock. Sand. Water.</i>

396
00:35:24,231 --> 00:35:28,695
<i>I see. Crab Key begins to interest me.</i>

397
00:35:28,821 --> 00:35:31,528
<i>What else do we know
about this Chinese gentleman?</i>

398
00:35:31,659 --> 00:35:33,783
<i>Nothing much. Except his name.</i>

399
00:35:34,788 --> 00:35:36,829
<i>Doctor No.</i>

400
00:36:11,479 --> 00:36:15,017
<i>- I'd like to see Professor Dent, please.
- Have you an appointment?</i>

401
00:36:15,151 --> 00:36:17,857
<i>James Bond.
We met yesterday at the Queen's Club.</i>

402
00:36:17,988 --> 00:36:20,528
<i>Very well. He's somewhere in the lab.</i>

403
00:36:21,621 --> 00:36:23,661
<i>Is Professor Dent there?</i>

404
00:36:26,168 --> 00:36:27,829
<i>Oh, never mind. Thank you.</i>

405
00:36:27,962 --> 00:36:29,458
<i>Morning, Professor.</i>

406
00:36:31,135 --> 00:36:33,378
<i>Mr Bond. Anything I can do for you?</i>

407
00:36:33,513 --> 00:36:36,966
<i>Yes. I came across this
in Strangways' office.</i>

408
00:36:37,727 --> 00:36:39,768
<i>Your receipt.</i>

409
00:36:39,980 --> 00:36:41,393
<i>Yes, that's right.</i>

410
00:36:41,525 --> 00:36:43,815
<i>Can you tell me anything about it?</i>

411
00:36:45,073 --> 00:36:49,571
<i>Poor old Strangways.
Bit of a bug of his, this amateur geology.</i>

412
00:36:49,746 --> 00:36:53,996
<i>He brought some rock samples in for
testing, convinced they were valuable.</i>

413
00:36:54,129 --> 00:36:55,623
<i>Were they?</i>

414
00:36:55,756 --> 00:36:58,711
<i>No, of course not.
Just low-grade iron pyrites.</i>

415
00:36:59,178 --> 00:37:01,089
<i>Can I see them?</i>

416
00:37:01,223 --> 00:37:03,596
<i>Well, no, I... I threw 'em away.</i>

417
00:37:04,811 --> 00:37:08,515
<i>- Do you know where he found them?
- No, he didn't say.</i>

418
00:37:09,443 --> 00:37:13,195
<i>- Crab Key, perhaps?
- Definitely not.</i>

419
00:37:13,658 --> 00:37:15,367
<i>Why so certain?</i>

420
00:37:15,828 --> 00:37:18,949
<i>- Not geologically possible.
- Thank you, Professor.</i>

421
00:37:19,083 --> 00:37:21,657
<i>It's kind of you to spare me your time.</i>

422
00:37:21,795 --> 00:37:23,836
<i>You're welcome, Mr Bond.</i>

423
00:37:24,049 --> 00:37:26,090
<i>Oh, Professor...</i>

424
00:37:28,681 --> 00:37:30,722
<i>Allow me.</i>

425
00:37:34,274 --> 00:37:36,315
<i>Morning.</i>

426
00:37:55,389 --> 00:37:58,309
<i>- Take me to Crab Key.
- I can't. You know the procedure.</i>

427
00:37:58,436 --> 00:38:01,688
<i>There's no time for procedure.
I'll take responsibility.</i>

428
00:38:01,817 --> 00:38:03,810
<i>Man, I hope you know what you're doing.</i>

429
00:38:03,944 --> 00:38:06,234
<i>- Come on...
- All right.</i>

430
00:38:48,972 --> 00:38:52,093
<i>- I radioed. They're expecting me.
- Go ahead.</i>

431
00:39:37,316 --> 00:39:39,857
<i>Sit down. </i>

432
00:39:47,249 --> 00:39:51,498
<i>Why have you disobeyed
my strictest rule and come in daylight? </i>

433
00:39:51,630 --> 00:39:53,174
<i>I had to.</i>

434
00:39:53,301 --> 00:39:55,507
<i>Bond came to see me this morning.</i>

435
00:39:55,636 --> 00:40:00,384
<i>Yes, I know. I gave orders that he should
be killed. Why is he still alive? </i>

436
00:40:00,978 --> 00:40:03,019
<i>Our attempts failed.</i>

437
00:40:03,148 --> 00:40:05,059
<i>Your attempts failed. </i>

438
00:40:05,193 --> 00:40:09,407
<i>I do not like failure. You are not
going to fail me again, Professor. </i>

439
00:40:09,533 --> 00:40:12,286
<i>No. I came to warn you.</i>

440
00:40:12,705 --> 00:40:14,081
<i>Warn me? </i>

441
00:40:14,207 --> 00:40:16,081
<i>Tell you.</i>

442
00:40:16,210 --> 00:40:19,829
<i>Bond discovered Strangways'
rock samples came from Crab Key.</i>

443
00:40:19,965 --> 00:40:22,292
<i>He's not a fool.
He's sure to come out here.</i>

444
00:40:22,427 --> 00:40:26,474
<i>I hope not.
If he does, I shall hold you responsible. </i>

445
00:40:26,601 --> 00:40:28,642
<i>I make myself clear? </i>

446
00:40:29,772 --> 00:40:31,812
<i>Yes, quite clear.</i>

447
00:40:33,152 --> 00:40:35,480
<i>Go to the table. </i>

448
00:40:47,634 --> 00:40:49,675
<i>You see what is in the cage? </i>

449
00:40:52,056 --> 00:40:54,098
<i>Pick it up. </i>

450
00:40:56,022 --> 00:40:58,061
<i>Pick it up! </i>

451
00:41:05,787 --> 00:41:07,828
<i>Tonight. </i>

452
00:41:23,397 --> 00:41:25,972
<i>- I'd like to send a cable.
- Yes, of course.</i>

453
00:41:27,069 --> 00:41:30,570
<i>By the way, the car you ordered,
it's been delivered.</i>

454
00:41:30,700 --> 00:41:32,990
<i>It's in number five parking lot.</i>

455
00:41:33,121 --> 00:41:35,161
<i>Thank you. Good night.</i>

456
00:41:35,289 --> 00:41:37,331
<i>Good night, Mr Bond.</i>

457
00:44:39,584 --> 00:44:41,912
<i>- Morning, Pleydell-Smith.
- Morning, Bond.</i>

458
00:44:42,047 --> 00:44:45,335
<i>Sorry to trouble you so early.
I need some information.</i>

459
00:44:45,470 --> 00:44:47,877
<i>All you have on Dr No and Crab Key.</i>

460
00:44:48,432 --> 00:44:50,972
<i>Miss Taro, bring me the files on Dr No.</i>

461
00:44:51,103 --> 00:44:52,134
<i>Sit down.</i>

462
00:44:52,271 --> 00:44:54,146
<i>What do you know about this island?</i>

463
00:44:54,274 --> 00:44:56,731
<i>Not much,
except there's a bauxite mine there.</i>

464
00:44:56,862 --> 00:44:59,567
<i>Dr No runs the place
like a concentration camp.</i>

465
00:44:59,699 --> 00:45:03,201
<i>I've heard funny rumours,
but no-one's complained officially.</i>

466
00:45:04,666 --> 00:45:09,496
<i>- Right, Miss Taro. Just leave them here.
- I'm very sorry, but we can't find them.</i>

467
00:45:09,632 --> 00:45:14,545
<i>- What do you mean? Who had them last?
- Commander Strangways, sir. Both files.</i>

468
00:45:14,681 --> 00:45:16,925
<i>All right, Miss Taro. All right.</i>

469
00:45:17,977 --> 00:45:20,897
<i>Damn nuisance,
their disappearing like that.</i>

470
00:45:21,025 --> 00:45:22,934
<i>On the contrary.</i>

471
00:45:23,487 --> 00:45:25,943
<i>I'd have been surprised if they hadn't.</i>

472
00:45:26,073 --> 00:45:30,204
<i>By the way, that came for you from
London this morning, in the plane,</i>

473
00:45:30,330 --> 00:45:32,371
<i>in the diplomatic pouch.</i>

474
00:45:36,631 --> 00:45:38,672
<i>A present from home.</i>

475
00:45:41,097 --> 00:45:43,469
<i>Can I get out that way?</i>

476
00:45:57,957 --> 00:46:01,826
<i>That's a naughty little habit -
listening at keyholes.</i>

477
00:46:01,962 --> 00:46:04,799
<i>I wasn't listening.
I was looking for those files.</i>

478
00:46:04,925 --> 00:46:07,632
<i>Anything that can't be found,
I get the blame.</i>

479
00:46:07,763 --> 00:46:11,014
<i>Oh, forget it.
Actually, it's not very important anyhow.</i>

480
00:46:11,143 --> 00:46:14,929
<i>I hate to think of you spending
all afternoon looking for them.</i>

481
00:46:15,065 --> 00:46:17,392
<i>No. I have the afternoon off.</i>

482
00:46:17,528 --> 00:46:22,157
<i>There's a coincidence. So have I.
Why don't you show me round the island?</i>

483
00:46:22,285 --> 00:46:25,656
<i>What should I say to an invitation
from a strange gentleman?</i>

484
00:46:25,790 --> 00:46:27,618
<i>You should say yes.</i>

485
00:46:27,751 --> 00:46:29,792
<i>I should say maybe.</i>

486
00:46:30,256 --> 00:46:32,048
<i>Three o'clock, my hotel,</i>

487
00:46:32,176 --> 00:46:34,216
<i>maybe?</i>

488
00:46:35,013 --> 00:46:36,722
<i>Yes, maybe.</i>

489
00:46:36,849 --> 00:46:38,475
<i>Good.</i>

490
00:46:49,631 --> 00:46:52,669
<i>The luminous dial activates it.
Here, hold this.</i>

491
00:46:52,801 --> 00:46:56,718
<i>Now, where exactly did Commander
Strangways place those samples?</i>

492
00:46:56,850 --> 00:46:59,936
<i>- About where your feet is, sir.
- Good.</i>

493
00:47:05,948 --> 00:47:07,776
<i>- Hi, there.
- Hi.</i>

494
00:47:07,909 --> 00:47:11,410
<i>- Lose something?
- Take a look at this Geiger reading.</i>

495
00:47:14,878 --> 00:47:19,341
<i>Those samples Strangways brought back
from Crab Key... were radioactive.</i>

496
00:47:19,468 --> 00:47:23,385
<i>Yet Professor Dent told me
they were worthless chunks of iron ore.</i>

497
00:47:23,516 --> 00:47:27,101
<i>- He's either a bad professor or a poor liar.
- I intend to find out which.</i>

498
00:47:27,230 --> 00:47:30,019
<i>Quarrel, how soon can you
get us over to Crab Key?</i>

499
00:47:30,152 --> 00:47:32,858
<i>Well... it's like this here, Captain.</i>

500
00:47:33,991 --> 00:47:37,656
<i>Commander Strangways,
he done take samples of all the islands.</i>

501
00:47:37,787 --> 00:47:41,575
<i>- We could check the nearest ones first.
- No. I'm interested in Crab Key.</i>

502
00:47:41,711 --> 00:47:45,331
<i>I done take the commander there.
We got away without trouble.</i>

503
00:47:45,467 --> 00:47:48,339
<i>It don't do to tempt providence too often.</i>

504
00:47:48,471 --> 00:47:50,595
<i>You see... there's a dragon.</i>

505
00:47:50,724 --> 00:47:53,762
<i>- What?
- Native superstition.</i>

506
00:47:53,896 --> 00:47:55,937
<i>Started by Dr No, probably.</i>

507
00:47:56,985 --> 00:47:58,895
<i>We won't force you to do anything.</i>

508
00:47:59,030 --> 00:48:03,158
<i>Leiter and I will go after dark, if you'll
give us the navigational directions.</i>

509
00:48:03,285 --> 00:48:07,785
<i>I gets my navigational directions
from my nose, my ears,</i>

510
00:48:07,917 --> 00:48:09,496
<i>from my instincts.</i>

511
00:48:10,714 --> 00:48:13,005
<i>Anyway, I'll be here about seven.</i>

512
00:48:15,221 --> 00:48:16,929
<i>Fine.</i>

513
00:48:23,901 --> 00:48:26,738
<i>Oh, Mr Bond!
There's a telephone message for you.</i>

514
00:48:26,864 --> 00:48:28,821
<i>Johnny, what have you done with it?</i>

515
00:48:28,950 --> 00:48:30,991
<i>It's right here.</i>

516
00:48:51,722 --> 00:48:53,679
<i>Hello?</i>

517
00:48:53,808 --> 00:48:55,849
<i>Oh, Mr Bond!</i>

518
00:48:56,146 --> 00:49:00,015
<i>I was thinking, why don't you
collect me at my apartment?</i>

519
00:49:00,985 --> 00:49:03,526
<i>It's lovely up here in the mountains.</i>

520
00:49:03,782 --> 00:49:05,740
<i>Nice and cool.</i>

521
00:49:05,869 --> 00:49:10,617
<i>All right. You leave the Port Royal Road
out of Kingston,</i>

522
00:49:10,920 --> 00:49:15,879
<i>then along the Wentworth Road,
until you get to the cement factory.</i>

523
00:49:16,093 --> 00:49:18,004
<i>Then you turn left.</i>

524
00:49:18,139 --> 00:49:20,262
<i>Follow the road up the hill, </i>

525
00:49:20,391 --> 00:49:22,350
<i>down the other side, </i>

526
00:49:22,478 --> 00:49:28,851
<i>then two miles further on, on the left,
Magenta Drive 239.</i>

527
00:49:30,866 --> 00:49:32,990
<i>I'll be waiting for you. </i>

528
00:51:13,231 --> 00:51:15,191
<i>How did it happen?</i>

529
00:51:16,947 --> 00:51:19,818
<i>I think they were on their way to a funeral.</i>

530
00:51:40,010 --> 00:51:42,051
<i>Just a minute!</i>

531
00:51:51,361 --> 00:51:53,568
<i>You did invite me here, remember?</i>

532
00:51:53,698 --> 00:51:58,197
<i>Oh, of course.
I just didn't expect you here so soon.</i>

533
00:51:59,581 --> 00:52:01,622
<i>Yes, yes, come in.</i>

534
00:52:05,716 --> 00:52:08,387
<i>Uh... I'll just go and put some clothes on.</i>

535
00:52:08,512 --> 00:52:11,051
<i>Don't go to any trouble on my account.</i>

536
00:52:13,395 --> 00:52:14,676
<i>Please!</i>

537
00:52:14,814 --> 00:52:18,515
<i>Forgive me. I thought I was
invited up here to admire the view.</i>

538
00:52:23,409 --> 00:52:25,818
<i>I feel one of us should answer it.</i>

539
00:52:33,593 --> 00:52:35,004
<i>Hello?</i>

540
00:52:35,137 --> 00:52:37,628
<i>Yes. Yes, I know. He's here now.</i>

541
00:52:42,230 --> 00:52:44,224
<i>I don't know what happened.</i>

542
00:52:45,194 --> 00:52:48,896
<i>All right. I'll try and keep him here
for a couple of hours.</i>

543
00:52:49,659 --> 00:52:51,403
<i>I'll have to go now.</i>

544
00:52:51,579 --> 00:52:53,703
<i>All right. I'll call you later.</i>

545
00:52:58,130 --> 00:53:01,049
<i>You believe in living dangerously.
I can see that.</i>

546
00:53:01,177 --> 00:53:02,920
<i>What do you mean?</i>

547
00:53:03,054 --> 00:53:06,841
<i>Sitting around with wet hair,
you'll die of pneumonia.</i>

548
00:53:10,024 --> 00:53:12,696
<i>- It's rather beautiful.
- Thank you.</i>

549
00:53:12,820 --> 00:53:14,813
<i>Do you always wear it up?</i>

550
00:53:14,948 --> 00:53:16,941
<i>- Don't you like it?
- Yes, very much.</i>

551
00:53:18,079 --> 00:53:21,163
<i>With your sort of... face... it's wonderful.</i>

552
00:53:22,918 --> 00:53:26,254
<i>- What's going on behind my back?
- Nothing.</i>

553
00:53:27,884 --> 00:53:29,925
<i>Look-no hands.</i>

554
00:53:45,996 --> 00:53:47,657
<i>I'm hungry.</i>

555
00:53:47,790 --> 00:53:49,499
<i>Let's go out and eat.</i>

556
00:53:49,627 --> 00:53:55,004
<i>- I'll make you a Chinese dinner here.
- No. I'm feeling Italian and musical.</i>

557
00:53:55,553 --> 00:53:59,006
<i>- Let's go to the Blue Mountain Grill.
- I'd rather stay here.</i>

558
00:53:59,142 --> 00:54:00,802
<i>It's more fun...</i>

559
00:54:00,935 --> 00:54:02,396
<i>alone.</i>

560
00:54:02,521 --> 00:54:05,144
<i>But I don't want you
getting dishpan hands.</i>

561
00:54:05,275 --> 00:54:09,110
<i>- I like cooking.
- Forget it. May I use your phone?</i>

562
00:54:12,453 --> 00:54:14,328
<i>Who are you ringing?</i>

563
00:54:14,457 --> 00:54:16,498
<i>Taxi.</i>

564
00:54:17,544 --> 00:54:23,088
<i>James Bond here. Can I have a car
sent to... 2171 Magenta Drive?</i>

565
00:54:23,221 --> 00:54:25,926
<i>As soon as you can, please. Thank you.</i>

566
00:54:26,766 --> 00:54:28,807
<i>I thought you came by car.</i>

567
00:54:28,937 --> 00:54:31,726
<i>Damn thing wouldn't start. Engine trouble.</i>

568
00:54:31,859 --> 00:54:33,900
<i>That explains...</i>

569
00:54:35,114 --> 00:54:36,692
<i>Explains what?</i>

570
00:54:36,824 --> 00:54:38,865
<i>Why you need a taxi.</i>

571
00:54:39,537 --> 00:54:41,578
<i>Why I need a taxi?</i>

572
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,040
<i>Careful-my nail varnish!</i>

573
00:54:54,936 --> 00:54:57,772
<i>- The lights.
- No, no, I always leave them on.</i>

574
00:55:01,863 --> 00:55:04,569
<i>What's... What's going on?!</i>

575
00:55:04,701 --> 00:55:08,915
<i>Forgive me. Book her, Superintendent,
will you? And, uh...</i>

576
00:55:09,040 --> 00:55:11,664
<i>be careful of her nail varnish.</i>

577
00:56:33,199 --> 00:56:35,609
<i>¶¶ Underneath the mango tree</i>

578
00:56:35,744 --> 00:56:40,492
<i>¶¶ Me honey and me
come watch for the moon</i>

579
00:56:41,045 --> 00:56:43,085
<i>¶¶ Underneath the mango tree</i>

580
00:56:43,255 --> 00:56:48,253
<i>¶¶ Me honey and me make bu-lu-lup soon</i>

581
00:56:48,597 --> 00:56:50,923
<i>¶¶ Underneath the moonlit sky</i>

582
00:56:51,226 --> 00:56:55,809
<i>¶¶ Me honey and I come sit hand in hand</i>

583
00:56:56,234 --> 00:56:58,275
<i>¶¶ Underneath the moonlit sky</i>

584
00:56:58,822 --> 00:57:03,154
<i>¶¶ Me honey and I come make fairyland</i>

585
00:57:04,246 --> 00:57:07,665
<i>¶¶ Mango, banana and tangerine</i>

586
00:57:07,795 --> 00:57:09,835
<i>¶¶ Sugar... </i>

587
00:57:36,421 --> 00:57:38,830
<i>Drop it, Professor! I'm behind you!</i>

588
00:57:43,516 --> 00:57:46,139
<i>I thought you'd turn up sooner or later.</i>

589
00:57:46,270 --> 00:57:48,310
<i>Sit down.</i>

590
00:57:50,693 --> 00:57:52,486
<i>The girl talked?</i>

591
00:57:52,613 --> 00:57:54,405
<i>But of course.</i>

592
00:57:54,532 --> 00:57:57,286
<i>I was suspicious
at the Queen's Club anyhow</i>

593
00:57:57,412 --> 00:58:02,456
<i>when it turned out you were the only one
who'd seen Strangways' new secretary.</i>

594
00:58:02,586 --> 00:58:04,497
<i>Then later, at the lab,</i>

595
00:58:04,632 --> 00:58:10,674
<i>you made no reference to the fact that
Strangways' samples were radioactive.</i>

596
00:58:10,808 --> 00:58:12,682
<i>Very clever, Mr Bond.</i>

597
00:58:14,020 --> 00:58:16,098
<i>But you're up against
more than you know.</i>

598
00:58:16,233 --> 00:58:18,475
<i>Shoot me and you'll end up
like Strangways.</i>

599
00:58:18,610 --> 00:58:22,446
<i>- Then you killed him?
- He was killed, but never mind how.</i>

600
00:58:22,743 --> 00:58:25,199
<i>Who are you working for, Professor?</i>

601
00:58:25,329 --> 00:58:29,377
<i>I'll tell you, as you won't live to use
the information. I'm working for...</i>

602
00:58:31,255 --> 00:58:33,296
<i>It's a Smith & Wesson.</i>

603
00:58:34,386 --> 00:58:36,297
<i>And you've had your six.</i>

604
00:58:53,374 --> 00:58:55,332
<i>Better late than never.</i>

605
00:58:55,460 --> 00:58:58,747
<i>- Everything ready?
- Yeah, for the last two hours.</i>

606
00:59:01,345 --> 00:59:03,503
<i>Everything's going to be fine.</i>

607
00:59:03,639 --> 00:59:07,935
<i>Bottom part of where my belly used to be
tells me different.</i>

608
00:59:08,064 --> 00:59:10,852
<i>For me, Crab Key will be
a gentle relaxation.</i>

609
00:59:10,984 --> 00:59:13,025
<i>From what? Dames?</i>

610
00:59:13,154 --> 00:59:14,815
<i>No, from being a clay pigeon.</i>

611
00:59:45,120 --> 00:59:47,743
<i>This is as far as we can go
with the engine.</i>

612
00:59:47,874 --> 00:59:50,746
<i>Make with paddle and wind
from now on in.</i>

613
00:59:50,879 --> 00:59:52,920
<i>OK.</i>

614
00:59:54,969 --> 00:59:56,629
<i>Let me go with him.</i>

615
00:59:56,762 --> 00:59:59,600
<i>No, we settled that. Anyhow, it's my beat.</i>

616
00:59:59,727 --> 01:00:02,644
<i>But it's my head in the noose
if anything gets unstuck.</i>

617
01:00:02,897 --> 01:00:05,853
<i>Canaveral can only wait 48 hours
for that moonshot.</i>

618
01:00:05,985 --> 01:00:08,822
<i>We'll be back in 12.
If not, then it's your beat.</i>

619
01:00:08,949 --> 01:00:11,620
<i>You'd better bring your Marines with you.</i>

620
01:00:11,787 --> 01:00:16,581
<i>Hey, Quarrel, if you see a dragon,
get in first and breathe on him, you hear?</i>

621
01:00:16,710 --> 01:00:19,582
<i>With all that rum in you, he'll die happy!</i>

622
01:00:46,840 --> 01:00:50,128
<i>Better drop the sail
in case their radar's on scan.</i>

623
01:00:59,025 --> 01:01:01,066
<i>Hard about, Captain... now!</i>

624
01:01:30,032 --> 01:01:32,072
<i>Cover it up.</i>

625
01:01:32,537 --> 01:01:35,076
<i>We'd better get some sleep
before it gets light.</i>

626
01:01:35,208 --> 01:01:37,248
<i>I'll be down this end.</i>

627
01:02:21,080 --> 01:02:23,953
<i>¶¶ Underneath the mango tree</i>

628
01:02:24,086 --> 01:02:26,293
<i>¶¶ La-la la-la dee</i>

629
01:02:26,421 --> 01:02:29,627
<i>¶¶ Come watch for the moon</i>

630
01:02:30,178 --> 01:02:31,293
<i>¶¶ La-la-da-da</i>

631
01:02:31,430 --> 01:02:34,515
<i>¶¶ Mango tree, me honey and me</i>

632
01:02:35,436 --> 01:02:37,477
<i>¶¶ Make bu-lu-lup</i>

633
01:02:37,607 --> 01:02:40,941
<i>¶¶ Underneath the mango tree...</i>

634
01:02:42,364 --> 01:02:44,405
<i>¶¶ Make bu-lu-lup soon</i>

635
01:02:45,242 --> 01:02:49,575
<i>¶¶ La-la-la dee-da-da... me honey and me</i>

636
01:02:50,418 --> 01:02:52,874
<i>¶¶ Underneath the mango tree</i>

637
01:02:53,004 --> 01:02:54,963
<i>¶¶ My honey and me...</i>

638
01:02:55,091 --> 01:02:57,133
<i>Who is that?</i>

639
01:03:02,854 --> 01:03:05,559
<i>It's all right.
I'm not supposed to be here, either.</i>

640
01:03:05,691 --> 01:03:08,017
<i>I take it you're not. Are you alone?</i>

641
01:03:08,153 --> 01:03:11,737
<i>What are you doing here?
Looking for shells?</i>

642
01:03:11,867 --> 01:03:14,156
<i>No. I'm just looking.</i>

643
01:03:14,287 --> 01:03:16,328
<i>Stay where you are.</i>

644
01:03:16,958 --> 01:03:19,497
<i>I promise I won't steal your shells.</i>

645
01:03:19,629 --> 01:03:21,423
<i>I promise you you won't, either.</i>

646
01:03:23,051 --> 01:03:24,249
<i>Stay where you are!</i>

647
01:03:24,386 --> 01:03:28,054
<i>I can assure you,
my intentions are strictly honourable.</i>

648
01:03:48,216 --> 01:03:50,256
<i>What's your name?</i>

649
01:03:50,677 --> 01:03:51,792
<i>Ryder.</i>

650
01:03:51,929 --> 01:03:53,092
<i>Ryder what?</i>

651
01:03:53,222 --> 01:03:55,263
<i>Honey... Ryder.</i>

652
01:03:56,394 --> 01:04:00,264
<i>- What's so funny about it?
- Nothing. It's a very pretty name.</i>

653
01:04:02,737 --> 01:04:04,778
<i>What's your name?</i>

654
01:04:04,949 --> 01:04:06,990
<i>James.</i>

655
01:04:07,870 --> 01:04:11,371
<i>Honey, did you use your sail
all the way up to the reef here?</i>

656
01:04:11,501 --> 01:04:13,709
<i>Of course. I always do.</i>

657
01:04:13,838 --> 01:04:16,590
<i>Then they'll know we're here.
They have radar.</i>

658
01:04:16,717 --> 01:04:19,256
<i>Oh, my boat is too small to be noticed.</i>

659
01:04:19,889 --> 01:04:22,262
<i>And I often come here to get the shells.</i>

660
01:04:22,393 --> 01:04:25,645
<i>At first they used to try to catch me,
but they couldn't.</i>

661
01:04:25,773 --> 01:04:29,856
<i>- Now I don't think they bother any more.
- They will this time.</i>

662
01:04:32,074 --> 01:04:35,326
<i>- Don't bother with those now.
- Don't bother?</i>

663
01:04:35,747 --> 01:04:37,574
<i>Are they valuable?</i>

664
01:04:37,708 --> 01:04:40,581
<i>This one is worth $50 in Miami.</i>

665
01:04:40,712 --> 01:04:42,540
<i>50!</i>

666
01:04:45,596 --> 01:04:47,969
<i>You promise you won't tell anyone?</i>

667
01:04:48,099 --> 01:04:49,725
<i>I promise.</i>

668
01:04:49,852 --> 01:04:53,187
<i>- Hey! Come and take a look!
- He's with me.</i>

669
01:04:54,066 --> 01:04:56,440
<i>Captain, what do you think of that!</i>

670
01:04:59,241 --> 01:05:01,281
<i>What's the matter?</i>

671
01:05:05,208 --> 01:05:08,746
<i>That's a high-powered boat.
Take some cover! Come on!</i>

672
01:05:37,257 --> 01:05:39,216
<i>They're here all right.</i>

673
01:05:39,345 --> 01:05:42,301
<i>OK, folks!
Come out and you won't get hurt!</i>

674
01:05:43,810 --> 01:05:45,851
<i>Stand up and show yourselves</i>

675
01:05:46,022 --> 01:05:48,230
<i>or I'll be forced to open fire!</i>

676
01:05:51,446 --> 01:05:52,645
<i>Come on out!</i>

677
01:05:52,782 --> 01:05:54,361
<i>We know you're there!</i>

678
01:05:54,493 --> 01:05:56,285
<i>We've been expecting you!</i>

679
01:05:56,412 --> 01:05:59,166
<i>Just walk out with your hands up
and you'll be OK!</i>

680
01:06:00,461 --> 01:06:02,205
<i>This is your last chance!</i>

681
01:06:02,338 --> 01:06:04,131
<i>He's bluffing. Keep down.</i>

682
01:06:04,926 --> 01:06:07,051
<i>All right. You've been warned!</i>

683
01:06:07,931 --> 01:06:09,094
<i>This is it!</i>

684
01:06:09,224 --> 01:06:12,393
<i>Lie still. It won't last long.
They don't know we're here.</i>

685
01:06:12,521 --> 01:06:13,518
<i>Fire!</i>

686
01:06:27,836 --> 01:06:29,544
<i>Are you coming out?</i>

687
01:06:30,090 --> 01:06:31,668
<i>All right, then.</i>

688
01:06:32,385 --> 01:06:33,760
<i>We'll be back.</i>

689
01:06:33,886 --> 01:06:35,928
<i>We'll be back with the dogs!</i>

690
01:06:36,057 --> 01:06:37,469
<i>Full speed ahead!</i>

691
01:07:01,054 --> 01:07:02,549
<i>I told you this place was wrong.</i>

692
01:07:02,682 --> 01:07:06,515
<i>- That was a machine gun, not a dragon.
- There's a dragon here, too.</i>

693
01:07:06,645 --> 01:07:07,643
<i>She's right.</i>

694
01:07:07,773 --> 01:07:10,692
<i>- You've seen it, hm?
- Yes, I have.</i>

695
01:07:10,819 --> 01:07:14,522
<i>He had two glaring eyes,
a short tail and pointed wings.</i>

696
01:07:14,658 --> 01:07:16,699
<i>He was breathing fire.</i>

697
01:07:17,371 --> 01:07:19,080
<i>You don't believe me, do you?</i>

698
01:07:19,207 --> 01:07:23,504
<i>Little gal, I does.
Let's get the hell outta here.</i>

699
01:07:23,631 --> 01:07:27,215
<i>Listen, both of you.
There are no such things as dragons.</i>

700
01:07:27,344 --> 01:07:32,055
<i>What you saw was something that looked
like one. I'm trying to think what it was.</i>

701
01:07:32,185 --> 01:07:33,680
<i>How do you know there aren't?</i>

702
01:07:33,813 --> 01:07:37,729
<i>What do you know about animals?
Did you ever see a mongoose dance?</i>

703
01:07:37,861 --> 01:07:41,398
<i>A scorpion with sunstroke
sting itself to death?</i>

704
01:07:41,533 --> 01:07:44,619
<i>Or a praying mantis
eat her husband after making love?</i>

705
01:07:44,747 --> 01:07:47,286
<i>- I hate to admit it, but I haven't.
- Well, I have.</i>

706
01:07:47,418 --> 01:07:49,246
<i>She's right.</i>

707
01:07:50,338 --> 01:07:54,006
<i>All right, they've gone.
Honey, you're getting out of here.</i>

708
01:07:54,137 --> 01:07:57,257
<i>I'm getting out when I'm ready.
That's never in daylight.</i>

709
01:07:57,391 --> 01:07:59,515
<i>This time you are, and fast.</i>

710
01:07:59,644 --> 01:08:01,520
<i>Where's your boat?</i>

711
01:08:02,440 --> 01:08:04,517
<i>Fetch my shoes.</i>

712
01:08:11,997 --> 01:08:14,704
<i>Look! Look what they've done!</i>

713
01:08:14,836 --> 01:08:16,876
<i>It's all your fault!</i>

714
01:08:17,839 --> 01:08:22,254
<i>I'm sorry. I'll get you a new boat
when we get back to Kingston.</i>

715
01:08:22,429 --> 01:08:25,432
<i>What are we going to do with her now?</i>

716
01:08:25,559 --> 01:08:28,681
<i>If you like,
I know a good place where we can hide.</i>

717
01:08:28,814 --> 01:08:31,687
<i>That'll do for a start.
Leave the things you don't need.</i>

718
01:08:31,819 --> 01:08:33,860
<i>All right, all right.</i>

719
01:08:56,541 --> 01:09:01,004
<i>- Must we come this way?
- Yes. It throws the dogs off the scent.</i>

720
01:09:02,592 --> 01:09:05,845
<i>- Damn mosquitoes!
- Rub water all over yourself.</i>

721
01:09:06,056 --> 01:09:08,096
<i>It's the salt they're after.</i>

722
01:09:12,524 --> 01:09:16,738
<i>Hey...! Quick! They's coming!
Across there!</i>

723
01:09:20,202 --> 01:09:23,787
<i>Quarrel, cut some of those reeds.
Give me the knife.</i>

724
01:09:24,126 --> 01:09:26,165
<i>Over there.</i>

725
01:09:37,354 --> 01:09:39,394
<i>They're coming closer.</i>

726
01:09:39,524 --> 01:09:41,018
<i>- Aiee!
- Keep quiet.</i>

727
01:09:41,151 --> 01:09:42,396
<i>Something's biting me!</i>

728
01:09:42,529 --> 01:09:45,401
<i>If you disturb the mud,
they'll know we've been here.</i>

729
01:10:10,028 --> 01:10:12,188
<i>- Looks like they're onto something.
- Sh!</i>

730
01:10:55,599 --> 01:10:57,428
<i>Ssh!</i>

731
01:10:57,562 --> 01:10:59,602
<i>Get down, get down!</i>

732
01:11:36,580 --> 01:11:39,416
<i>- Why?
- Because I had to.</i>

733
01:11:39,542 --> 01:11:43,495
<i>That guy sure knew his business,
trailing us after we let the others pass.</i>

734
01:11:43,633 --> 01:11:45,922
<i>Where is this hiding place of yours?</i>

735
01:11:46,052 --> 01:11:47,132
<i>Up there.</i>

736
01:11:49,808 --> 01:11:50,888
<i>Come on.</i>

737
01:12:02,328 --> 01:12:04,571
<i>You smell nicer already.</i>

738
01:12:05,249 --> 01:12:07,290
<i>Oh, thank you.</i>

739
01:12:07,753 --> 01:12:09,794
<i>Mr Bond! Quick!</i>

740
01:12:12,635 --> 01:12:14,428
<i>- What is it now?
- Look at these!</i>

741
01:12:18,143 --> 01:12:20,184
<i>Those are dragon tracks!</i>

742
01:12:20,857 --> 01:12:23,229
<i>Look! That's where he breathed!</i>

743
01:12:23,485 --> 01:12:26,357
<i>Captain, you ought to get some rest
if you wants to.</i>

744
01:12:26,490 --> 01:12:28,946
<i>I stay out here... on watch...</i>

745
01:12:29,077 --> 01:12:31,534
<i>in case he comes a-looking for us.</i>

746
01:12:31,663 --> 01:12:34,038
<i>Right, and I'll take the second watch.</i>

747
01:12:35,254 --> 01:12:37,461
<i>We'll be out of here by midnight.</i>

748
01:12:40,595 --> 01:12:42,968
<i>I never met a detective before.</i>

749
01:12:44,184 --> 01:12:46,392
<i>Are you going to arrest Dr No?</i>

750
01:12:46,521 --> 01:12:51,482
<i>Someone is. We can't have him trying
to kill everyone who comes here.</i>

751
01:12:51,612 --> 01:12:53,487
<i>He doesn't just try.</i>

752
01:12:53,616 --> 01:12:56,652
<i>- Mm?
- I'm pretty sure he killed my father.</i>

753
01:12:56,786 --> 01:12:57,784
<i>What?</i>

754
01:12:57,913 --> 01:13:01,747
<i>You see,
my father was a marine zoologist.</i>

755
01:13:01,876 --> 01:13:05,415
<i>We came to the Caribbean
for him to study seashells.</i>

756
01:13:05,550 --> 01:13:07,674
<i>One day he came to Crab Key...</i>

757
01:13:07,804 --> 01:13:09,798
<i>...and I never saw him again.</i>

758
01:13:09,931 --> 01:13:12,555
<i>They said he must have drowned,</i>

759
01:13:12,686 --> 01:13:16,020
<i>but he was too good a diver
for that to happen to him.</i>

760
01:13:16,149 --> 01:13:18,856
<i>Didn't the police investigate?
And your family?</i>

761
01:13:18,988 --> 01:13:21,694
<i>They investigated for a long time.</i>

762
01:13:22,075 --> 01:13:24,864
<i>Then they said
"Missing, presumed dead".</i>

763
01:13:24,997 --> 01:13:28,082
<i>I haven't got any family.
There was only my father and me.</i>

764
01:13:28,210 --> 01:13:29,835
<i>You're here all alone?</i>

765
01:13:29,963 --> 01:13:32,086
<i>Where did you live before?</i>

766
01:13:32,216 --> 01:13:34,008
<i>All over the world.</i>

767
01:13:34,135 --> 01:13:36,462
<i>The Philippines, Bali, Hawaii.</i>

768
01:13:36,598 --> 01:13:38,342
<i>Anywhere there were shells.</i>

769
01:13:38,476 --> 01:13:40,386
<i>You went to school somewhere? </i>

770
01:13:40,520 --> 01:13:43,606
<i>I didn't need to. We had an encyclopedia.</i>

771
01:13:43,734 --> 01:13:46,856
<i>I started at A when I was eight,
and now I've reached T.</i>

772
01:13:46,989 --> 01:13:49,612
<i>I bet I know a lot more things than you do.</i>

773
01:13:51,663 --> 01:13:54,120
<i>Didn't anyone in Kingston help?</i>

774
01:13:54,835 --> 01:13:59,794
<i>Well... there was this man who owned
the place where we were living.</i>

775
01:13:59,925 --> 01:14:02,882
<i>He let me stay on
for a while without paying.</i>

776
01:14:03,348 --> 01:14:05,970
<i>Then one night he came up to my room...</i>

777
01:14:06,727 --> 01:14:08,104
<i>Well, you know.</i>

778
01:14:09,023 --> 01:14:11,894
<i>I scratched his face, and then...</i>

779
01:14:12,027 --> 01:14:14,068
<i>But he was stronger than I was.</i>

780
01:14:14,197 --> 01:14:15,906
<i>What happened after that?</i>

781
01:14:17,786 --> 01:14:21,573
<i>I put a black-widow spider
underneath his mosquito net.</i>

782
01:14:22,169 --> 01:14:24,376
<i>A female, and they're the worst.</i>

783
01:14:24,672 --> 01:14:26,713
<i>It took him a whole week to die.</i>

784
01:14:29,929 --> 01:14:31,010
<i>Did I do wrong?</i>

785
01:14:32,558 --> 01:14:35,348
<i>Well, it wouldn't do to make a habit of it.</i>

786
01:14:37,233 --> 01:14:40,022
<i>Do you have a woman of your own?</i>

787
01:14:43,492 --> 01:14:45,202
<i>Captain, quick! Down here!</i>

788
01:14:46,664 --> 01:14:49,536
<i>Whatever's coming, it's coming this way!</i>

789
01:14:49,878 --> 01:14:52,287
<i>This time I want to see it.</i>

790
01:14:52,632 --> 01:14:55,254
<i>And hurry!
There's less than 12 hours to go!</i>

791
01:15:20,710 --> 01:15:22,289
<i>Stay where you are! </i>

792
01:15:22,421 --> 01:15:24,961
<i>All of you! Stay right where you are! </i>

793
01:15:36,527 --> 01:15:39,446
<i>OK, Captain.
If that ain't a dragon, what is it?</i>

794
01:15:39,574 --> 01:15:41,317
<i>A dragon that runs on diesel.</i>

795
01:15:41,451 --> 01:15:46,494
<i>Forget the spooks, Quarrel. You take the
driver. I'll take the headlights and tyres.</i>

796
01:15:46,625 --> 01:15:48,121
<i>You keep safe out of sight.</i>

797
01:15:48,253 --> 01:15:49,451
<i>Come on.</i>

798
01:16:24,976 --> 01:16:26,768
<i>I told you to stay there!</i>

799
01:16:26,896 --> 01:16:28,936
<i>- I was frightened.
- Get down!</i>

800
01:16:44,214 --> 01:16:46,707
<i>Come on out!
Hands where we can see 'em!</i>

801
01:16:49,348 --> 01:16:51,425
<i>And the dame! Quick!</i>

802
01:16:51,809 --> 01:16:53,934
<i>Unless you want an extra navel.</i>

803
01:16:56,775 --> 01:16:58,603
<i>Hold it. Drop that gun.</i>

804
01:17:00,531 --> 01:17:02,572
<i>Now kick it away from you.</i>

805
01:17:04,496 --> 01:17:09,042
<i>The girl will stay where she is.
Now walk towards me, hands out in front.</i>

806
01:17:19,770 --> 01:17:21,763
<i>Come on!</i>

807
01:17:21,897 --> 01:17:24,734
<i>Hey, you!
Where do you think you're going!</i>

808
01:17:25,779 --> 01:17:28,816
<i>Sorry we ain't got any flowers.
Come on, let's go.</i>

809
01:17:28,950 --> 01:17:31,656
<i>Come on. Come on, let's go!</i>

810
01:17:37,172 --> 01:17:38,417
<i>Give me that knife.</i>

811
01:17:51,861 --> 01:17:53,356
<i>Leave him alone!</i>

812
01:17:53,487 --> 01:17:56,028
<i>- Leave him alone!
- Get out of the way!</i>

813
01:18:12,027 --> 01:18:13,438
<i>Get inside!</i>

814
01:18:13,570 --> 01:18:15,611
<i>Keep an eye on the man.</i>

815
01:18:16,118 --> 01:18:20,662
<i>And be careful. They've been
in the swamp and they're contaminated.</i>

816
01:18:23,504 --> 01:18:25,544
<i>Check their Geiger reading. </i>

817
01:18:32,684 --> 01:18:34,558
<i>He's reading 95, Chief.</i>

818
01:18:34,688 --> 01:18:36,016
<i>She's 88.</i>

819
01:18:36,148 --> 01:18:39,566
<i>Too much for the monitor.
Scrub them down, but quick!</i>

820
01:18:51,963 --> 01:18:53,673
<i>Do another reading.</i>

821
01:19:02,271 --> 01:19:05,357
<i>- Reading 72.8.
- The mud's soaked into their clothes.</i>

822
01:19:05,485 --> 01:19:07,859
<i>All right, then. Take off all their clothes.</i>

823
01:19:07,988 --> 01:19:11,524
<i>- What's he going to do?
- Do as he says. We're contaminated.</i>

824
01:19:11,660 --> 01:19:14,699
<i>- Do the girl first.
- We give the orders around here.</i>

825
01:19:14,833 --> 01:19:18,748
<i>Fine, but do something about this.
Come here, you. Here.</i>

826
01:19:20,466 --> 01:19:23,552
<i>Use the high-temperature jets.
Full pressure.</i>

827
01:19:31,608 --> 01:19:33,649
<i>68.</i>

828
01:19:36,032 --> 01:19:39,153
<i>- She's reading 47.
- All right. Put the man through.</i>

829
01:19:40,497 --> 01:19:42,538
<i>He's now clocking 40.</i>

830
01:19:43,251 --> 01:19:45,292
<i>Stages three and five.</i>

831
01:19:45,713 --> 01:19:48,040
<i>Reading 38.</i>

832
01:19:49,177 --> 01:19:51,217
<i>32.</i>

833
01:19:51,473 --> 01:19:53,965
<i>- Down to 8.
- Hold the girl.</i>

834
01:19:56,563 --> 01:19:58,605
<i>He's now 18.</i>

835
01:20:01,613 --> 01:20:03,654
<i>He's now at 8.</i>

836
01:20:07,038 --> 01:20:09,577
<i>- She's clear.
- Good. Get the man ready.</i>

837
01:20:15,468 --> 01:20:17,296
<i>He's got a count of four.</i>

838
01:20:17,429 --> 01:20:20,799
<i>- Check his fingernails.
- Put your hands in there.</i>

839
01:20:21,267 --> 01:20:22,597
<i>He's OK.</i>

840
01:20:22,729 --> 01:20:25,434
<i>I will notify reception
they're coming through.</i>

841
01:20:26,443 --> 01:20:29,814
<i>Decontamination here.
They're coming through.</i>

842
01:20:57,485 --> 01:20:58,731
<i>Come in.</i>

843
01:20:58,862 --> 01:21:00,903
<i>Come in!</i>

844
01:21:01,032 --> 01:21:03,442
<i>Come in... you poor dears.</i>

845
01:21:03,912 --> 01:21:06,405
<i>We simply didn't know
when to expect you.</i>

846
01:21:06,541 --> 01:21:09,663
<i>First it was teatime yesterday,
and then dinner.</i>

847
01:21:09,795 --> 01:21:12,919
<i>It was only half an hour ago
we knew you were on your way.</i>

848
01:21:13,051 --> 01:21:16,302
<i>Cigarette? American, English, or Turkish?</i>

849
01:21:16,431 --> 01:21:20,978
<i>I'm Sister Rose. This is Sister Lily. We'll
make your stay as pleasant as possible.</i>

850
01:21:21,105 --> 01:21:23,098
<i>That's most kind of you, but...</i>

851
01:21:23,233 --> 01:21:26,937
<i>Oh, you'll want to see your rooms!
Breakfast is ready,</i>

852
01:21:27,073 --> 01:21:29,530
<i>and then you'll want to sleep.</i>

853
01:21:32,123 --> 01:21:36,419
<i>The doctor left strict orders you're
not to be disturbed until this evening.</i>

854
01:21:36,545 --> 01:21:38,836
<i>He'll be delighted
if you join him for dinner.</i>

855
01:21:38,967 --> 01:21:41,921
<i>- Will you be there?
- Tell him I also will be delighted.</i>

856
01:21:42,054 --> 01:21:44,178
<i>Splendid. I know he'll be pleased.</i>

857
01:21:44,308 --> 01:21:46,349
<i>Here we are.</i>

858
01:21:48,481 --> 01:21:50,688
<i>This will be your room, Mr Bond.</i>

859
01:21:52,654 --> 01:21:54,694
<i>This is your bathroom in here.</i>

860
01:21:55,450 --> 01:21:57,491
<i>And for you, young lady,</i>

861
01:21:58,204 --> 01:22:00,245
<i>this is your room.</i>

862
01:22:03,212 --> 01:22:05,585
<i>You'll find fresh clothes in here.</i>

863
01:22:08,512 --> 01:22:12,595
<i>I hope they fit.
We didn't get your sizes till last night.</i>

864
01:22:12,726 --> 01:22:16,015
<i>Don't hesitate to ring
if there's anything you want.</i>

865
01:22:16,148 --> 01:22:18,357
<i>Such as two air tickets to London?</i>

866
01:22:19,778 --> 01:22:22,486
<i>I'll leave you two dear people in peace.</i>

867
01:22:36,890 --> 01:22:41,601
<i>- Well, let's have some breakfast.
- How can you eat at a time like this?</i>

868
01:22:41,730 --> 01:22:45,729
<i>I'm hungry. We don't know when
we'll get the chance to eat again.</i>

869
01:22:45,861 --> 01:22:47,272
<i>Here, take this.</i>

870
01:22:47,405 --> 01:22:51,903
<i>Careful. The whole place
is probably wired for sound.</i>

871
01:23:02,137 --> 01:23:03,964
<i>Have you...</i>

872
01:23:04,307 --> 01:23:07,511
<i>Have you any idea
what they'll do with us?</i>

873
01:23:07,645 --> 01:23:09,686
<i>No idea.</i>

874
01:23:10,316 --> 01:23:12,772
<i>No door handles or windows, either.</i>

875
01:23:15,950 --> 01:23:17,527
<i>It's a prison, then.</i>

876
01:23:17,660 --> 01:23:20,449
<i>Mink-lined with first-class service.</i>

877
01:23:24,504 --> 01:23:26,545
<i>What's the matter?</i>

878
01:23:27,760 --> 01:23:29,799
<i>I don't feel so good.</i>

879
01:23:31,723 --> 01:23:33,764
<i>I feel so sleepy.</i>

880
01:23:37,232 --> 01:23:39,274
<i>Damn coffee!</i>

881
01:24:53,684 --> 01:24:55,724
<i>How do you feel?</i>

882
01:24:57,773 --> 01:24:59,813
<i>Sleepy.</i>

883
01:25:00,945 --> 01:25:03,069
<i>What made us pass out like that?</i>

884
01:25:03,241 --> 01:25:05,281
<i>The coffee was drugged.</i>

885
01:25:10,751 --> 01:25:14,252
<i>It's time for dinner.
We don't want to keep the doctor waiting.</i>

886
01:25:14,381 --> 01:25:16,174
<i>That would never do. Ready, Honey?</i>

887
01:25:18,764 --> 01:25:20,258
<i>I suppose so.</i>

888
01:25:25,482 --> 01:25:27,524
<i>You're doing fine.</i>

889
01:25:31,158 --> 01:25:33,199
<i>Come on.</i>

890
01:25:33,745 --> 01:25:36,368
<i>Am I properly dressed for the occasion?</i>

891
01:25:36,499 --> 01:25:39,122
<i>- Quite suitable.
- Suitable for what?</i>

892
01:25:52,233 --> 01:25:54,274
<i>This way, please.</i>

893
01:25:57,699 --> 01:25:59,942
<i>I'm glad your hands are sweating, too.</i>

894
01:26:00,078 --> 01:26:01,952
<i>Of course I'm scared, too.</i>

895
01:26:02,080 --> 01:26:04,953
<i>Be natural and leave all the talking to me.</i>

896
01:26:05,085 --> 01:26:07,127
<i>In here, please.</i>

897
01:26:07,297 --> 01:26:09,337
<i>I hope you enjoy your dinner.</i>

898
01:27:05,377 --> 01:27:07,418
<i>Come and look!</i>

899
01:27:16,770 --> 01:27:21,020
<i>Artificial light. We could be
hundreds of feet beneath the sea.</i>

900
01:27:21,151 --> 01:27:22,980
<i>Look at that. Sea tulips.</i>

901
01:27:23,113 --> 01:27:25,072
<i>They do not grow above 200ft.</i>

902
01:27:25,199 --> 01:27:27,906
<i>One million dollars, Mr Bond.</i>

903
01:27:28,914 --> 01:27:30,907
<i>You were wondering what it cost.</i>

904
01:27:31,041 --> 01:27:32,870
<i>As a matter of fact, I was.</i>

905
01:27:40,390 --> 01:27:44,520
<i>Forgive my not shaking hands.
It's awkward with these. A misfortune.</i>

906
01:27:44,645 --> 01:27:47,020
<i>You were admiring my aquarium.</i>

907
01:27:48,736 --> 01:27:50,895
<i>Yes. It's quite impressive.</i>

908
01:27:51,031 --> 01:27:54,948
<i>A unique feat of engineering,
if I may say so. I designed it myself.</i>

909
01:27:55,080 --> 01:27:59,542
<i>The glass is convex, ten inches thick,
which accounts for the magnifying effect.</i>

910
01:27:59,670 --> 01:28:04,584
<i>Minnows pretending they're whales.
Just like you on this island, Dr No.</i>

911
01:28:04,719 --> 01:28:06,760
<i>It depends, Mr Bond,</i>

912
01:28:06,931 --> 01:28:09,388
<i>on which side of the glass you are.</i>

913
01:28:10,019 --> 01:28:13,438
<i>A medium dry martini, lemon peel,
shaken, not stirred.</i>

914
01:28:13,566 --> 01:28:16,023
<i>- Vodka?
- Of course.</i>

915
01:28:16,862 --> 01:28:18,903
<i>We'll have dinner at once.</i>

916
01:28:19,784 --> 01:28:22,740
<i>There's so much to discuss. So little time.</i>

917
01:28:45,819 --> 01:28:48,739
<i>Well, Dr No, you haven't done badly,
considering.</i>

918
01:28:48,866 --> 01:28:51,027
<i>A handicap is what you make of it.</i>

919
01:28:51,161 --> 01:28:54,117
<i>I was the unwanted child
of a German missionary</i>

920
01:28:54,249 --> 01:28:56,492
<i>and a Chinese girl of good family.</i>

921
01:28:56,628 --> 01:29:01,292
<i>Yet I became treasurer of the most
powerful criminal society in China.</i>

922
01:29:01,427 --> 01:29:06,221
<i>It's rare for the Tongs to trust anyone
who isn't completely Chinese.</i>

923
01:29:06,476 --> 01:29:08,517
<i>I doubt they shall do so again.</i>

924
01:29:08,688 --> 01:29:12,902
<i>I escaped to America
with ten million of their dollars in gold.</i>

925
01:29:13,028 --> 01:29:15,782
<i>That's how you financed this operation.</i>

926
01:29:15,908 --> 01:29:19,575
<i>A good idea to use atomic power.
I'm glad you can handle it properly.</i>

927
01:29:19,705 --> 01:29:25,082
<i>I'd hate to think your decontamination
chamber wasn't effective.</i>

928
01:29:25,213 --> 01:29:29,427
<i>My work has given me
a unique knowledge of radioactivity,</i>

929
01:29:29,554 --> 01:29:32,306
<i>but not without costs, as you see.</i>

930
01:29:32,976 --> 01:29:34,721
<i>Yes.</i>

931
01:29:34,854 --> 01:29:40,195
<i>Your power source had
our organisation puzzled for some time.</i>

932
01:29:40,362 --> 01:29:42,403
<i>They are still puzzled, Mr Bond.</i>

933
01:29:42,533 --> 01:29:45,238
<i>Not any longer. I sent a complete report.</i>

934
01:29:45,370 --> 01:29:50,248
<i>You've not contacted your headquarters
since you requested a Geiger counter.</i>

935
01:29:50,378 --> 01:29:54,129
<i>But there are so many files
open on you already, Dr No.</i>

936
01:29:54,968 --> 01:29:56,713
<i>Our own, the CIA's...</i>

937
01:29:57,888 --> 01:30:01,058
<i>The one from the Tong society
that you robbed.</i>

938
01:30:01,186 --> 01:30:05,055
<i>When trouble comes, you'll find
this is a small and naked island.</i>

939
01:30:05,192 --> 01:30:07,483
<i>An expendable island.</i>

940
01:30:07,614 --> 01:30:11,113
<i>When my mission is accomplished,
I'll destroy it and move on.</i>

941
01:30:11,243 --> 01:30:15,789
<i>But the habit of enquiry is consistent.
I see you're wondering why, where, when.</i>

942
01:30:15,916 --> 01:30:19,122
<i>I gratify your curiosity
because you're the one man</i>

943
01:30:19,256 --> 01:30:21,630
<i>capable of appreciating what I've done</i>

944
01:30:23,095 --> 01:30:25,337
<i>and keeping it to himself.</i>

945
01:30:26,267 --> 01:30:31,774
<i>Just a minute. There's no point
in involving the girl at this stage.</i>

946
01:30:31,900 --> 01:30:34,937
<i>Let her go free. She'll promise not to talk.</i>

947
01:30:35,071 --> 01:30:37,826
<i>- No, I'm staying with you.
- I don't want you here.</i>

948
01:30:37,951 --> 01:30:40,491
<i>I agree. This is no place for the girl.</i>

949
01:30:40,664 --> 01:30:42,704
<i>Take her away.</i>

950
01:30:43,835 --> 01:30:44,832
<i>No!</i>

951
01:30:45,922 --> 01:30:47,086
<i>No!</i>

952
01:30:47,217 --> 01:30:51,596
<i>- I'm sure the guards will amuse her.
- Let me go! No!</i>

953
01:30:53,309 --> 01:30:57,178
<i>That's a Dom Pérignon '55.
It would be a pity to break it.</i>

954
01:31:01,779 --> 01:31:03,572
<i>I prefer the '53 myself.</i>

955
01:31:06,161 --> 01:31:09,199
<i>Clumsy effort, Mr Bond.
You disappoint me.</i>

956
01:31:09,333 --> 01:31:11,374
<i>I'm not a fool,</i>

957
01:31:11,503 --> 01:31:16,168
<i>so please do not treat me as one.
And that table knife, please put it back.</i>

958
01:31:18,806 --> 01:31:21,132
<i>Well, we can't all be geniuses, can we?</i>

959
01:31:21,267 --> 01:31:26,776
<i>Does the toppling of American missiles
really compensate for having no hands?</i>

960
01:31:26,902 --> 01:31:30,522
<i>Missiles are only the first step
to prove our power.</i>

961
01:31:30,657 --> 01:31:35,619
<i>Our power? Your disregard for human life
means you must be working for the East.</i>

962
01:31:35,749 --> 01:31:39,582
<i>East, West-just points of the compass,
each as stupid as the other.</i>

963
01:31:39,712 --> 01:31:41,920
<i>I'm a member of SPECTRE.</i>

964
01:31:42,050 --> 01:31:43,427
<i>- SPECTRE?
- SPECTRE.</i>

965
01:31:43,553 --> 01:31:48,977
<i>Special Executive for Counterintelligence,
Terrorism, Revenge, Extortion.</i>

966
01:31:49,103 --> 01:31:53,566
<i>The four cornerstones of power, headed
by the greatest brains in the world.</i>

967
01:31:53,693 --> 01:31:56,150
<i>Correction. Criminal brains.</i>

968
01:31:56,280 --> 01:32:00,280
<i>The successful criminal brain
is always superior. It has to be.</i>

969
01:32:00,412 --> 01:32:02,287
<i>Well, why become criminal?</i>

970
01:32:02,415 --> 01:32:06,332
<i>I'm sure the West would welcome
a scientist of your... calibre.</i>

971
01:32:07,131 --> 01:32:10,584
<i>The Americans are fools.
I offered my services. They refused.</i>

972
01:32:10,719 --> 01:32:15,219
<i>So did the East.
Now they can both pay for their mistake.</i>

973
01:32:15,352 --> 01:32:19,517
<i>World domination. That same old dream.</i>

974
01:32:19,649 --> 01:32:23,863
<i>Our asylums are full of people
who think they're Napoleon... or God.</i>

975
01:32:28,956 --> 01:32:31,994
<i>You persist in trying to provoke me,
Mr Bond.</i>

976
01:32:32,127 --> 01:32:35,747
<i>- I could've had you killed in the swamp.
- And why didn't you?</i>

977
01:32:37,051 --> 01:32:41,633
<i>I thought you less stupid.
Usually, when a man gets in my way...</i>

978
01:32:46,274 --> 01:32:49,193
<i>But you were different.
You cost me time, money,</i>

979
01:32:49,320 --> 01:32:52,027
<i>effort. You damaged my organisation</i>

980
01:32:52,158 --> 01:32:53,571
<i>and my pride.</i>

981
01:32:53,702 --> 01:32:56,621
<i>I was curious to see
what kind of a man you were.</i>

982
01:32:56,748 --> 01:32:59,538
<i>I thought there might be a place
for you with SPECTRE.</i>

983
01:32:59,670 --> 01:33:01,794
<i>I'm flattered.</i>

984
01:33:01,923 --> 01:33:04,796
<i>I'd prefer the revenge department.</i>

985
01:33:05,887 --> 01:33:12,144
<i>My first job would be finding the man
who killed Strangways and Quarrel.</i>

986
01:33:12,273 --> 01:33:15,691
<i>I misjudged you.
You are just a stupid policeman</i>

987
01:33:18,658 --> 01:33:21,196
<i>whose luck has run out.</i>

988
01:33:21,662 --> 01:33:25,116
<i>They're waiting for you
in the control room, Dr No.</i>

989
01:33:25,251 --> 01:33:29,001
<i>No hurry. They won't have started
their countdown check yet.</i>

990
01:33:29,132 --> 01:33:34,591
<i>You won't get away with it, Dr No. The
Americans are prepared for any trouble.</i>

991
01:33:36,017 --> 01:33:38,593
<i>I never fail, Mr Bond.</i>

992
01:33:38,731 --> 01:33:40,522
<i>What do we do with him?</i>

993
01:33:40,649 --> 01:33:43,856
<i>Soften him up.
I haven't finished with him yet.</i>

994
01:36:09,374 --> 01:36:10,371
<i>Aagh!</i>

995
01:39:24,402 --> 01:39:27,025
<i>Have you got new fuel elements loaded?</i>

996
01:39:27,324 --> 01:39:29,363
<i>All ready, sir.</i>

997
01:39:32,540 --> 01:39:35,458
<i>The roadblock is about 3,000ft away. </i>

998
01:39:35,586 --> 01:39:38,292
<i>Everyone is pulled back.
No traffic allowed. </i>

999
01:39:38,424 --> 01:39:41,129
<i>The launch area is completely cleared... </i>

1000
01:39:52,070 --> 01:39:55,358
<i>The vehicle is now
at its full weight of 240 tons. </i>

1001
01:39:55,491 --> 01:39:59,622
<i>All the automatic transistors
have been put onto the vehicle. </i>

1002
01:39:59,748 --> 01:40:02,205
<i>We will run up
to half power for 30 seconds.</i>

1003
01:40:06,341 --> 01:40:08,382
<i>Control interlocks free.</i>

1004
01:40:08,511 --> 01:40:10,553
<i>Fuel elements 12.5.</i>

1005
01:40:30,421 --> 01:40:31,501
<i>Control?</i>

1006
01:40:31,632 --> 01:40:36,509
<i>Control rod actuators operating.
Core temperature 113.</i>

1007
01:40:36,973 --> 01:40:38,171
<i>Converters?</i>

1008
01:40:38,308 --> 01:40:41,429
<i>Converters standing by.
Ignition heaters on.</i>

1009
01:40:42,064 --> 01:40:44,105
<i>Radiation?</i>

1010
01:40:44,401 --> 01:40:47,606
<i>Counters 121, 141, 109.</i>

1011
01:40:47,739 --> 01:40:51,027
<i>- Energy stabilisers?
- Energy steady...</i>

1012
01:40:51,161 --> 01:40:56,325
<i>The tracking stations are plugged into
the control centre at Cape Canaveral. </i>

1013
01:40:56,462 --> 01:40:57,659
<i>Fuel elements?</i>

1014
01:40:57,796 --> 01:41:01,333
<i>- We're just checking...
- Fuel elements! Where's Chang?</i>

1015
01:41:02,387 --> 01:41:05,924
<i>Chang! What are you doing there?!
Get on the gantry!</i>

1016
01:41:08,813 --> 01:41:10,094
<i>Hurry!</i>

1017
01:41:16,992 --> 01:41:19,949
<i>- Shut down.
- Shut down reactor!</i>

1018
01:41:28,680 --> 01:41:32,215
<i>This is Mercury Control.
Countdown for... </i>

1019
01:41:32,351 --> 01:41:35,853
<i>Reactor shutdown,
temperature 227, falling.</i>

1020
01:41:36,274 --> 01:41:38,564
<i>- Converters off.
- Converters off.</i>

1021
01:41:38,695 --> 01:41:42,611
<i>- Radiation reading.
- Radiation zero.</i>

1022
01:41:43,034 --> 01:41:44,744
<i>Shutdown procedure complete.</i>

1023
01:41:44,872 --> 01:41:46,866
<i>Reactor safe.</i>

1024
01:41:47,000 --> 01:41:48,827
<i>Last fuelling control has been made. </i>

1025
01:41:48,960 --> 01:41:50,621
<i>Stand by.</i>

1026
01:41:50,755 --> 01:41:53,592
<i>We stay on Mercury Control
for the countdown. </i>

1027
01:41:53,718 --> 01:42:00,601
<i>This is Mercury Control. The check
indicates all systems are go at this time. </i>

1028
01:42:00,729 --> 01:42:04,978
<i>The countdown is now four minutes,
30 seconds</i>

1029
01:42:05,111 --> 01:42:07,150
<i>and counting. </i>

1030
01:42:10,202 --> 01:42:12,076
<i>This is Mercury Control. </i>

1031
01:42:12,706 --> 01:42:18,296
<i>The spacecraft pilot, the launch, the
tracking crew in case of emergency, </i>

1032
01:42:18,423 --> 01:42:20,997
<i>and even the weather man,
have given us the word go. </i>

1033
01:42:21,135 --> 01:42:24,304
<i>Remain on standby.
Approximately two minutes to go.</i>

1034
01:42:24,433 --> 01:42:27,269
<i>Control rod actuators standing by.</i>

1035
01:42:28,187 --> 01:42:30,395
<i>Converters standing by.</i>

1036
01:42:31,110 --> 01:42:33,732
<i>Synchronise radio beam for toppling.</i>

1037
01:42:35,073 --> 01:42:37,863
<i>Synchronising radio beam for toppling.</i>

1038
01:42:51,140 --> 01:42:53,299
<i>Radio beam synchronised for toppling.</i>

1039
01:42:53,435 --> 01:42:56,438
<i>Zeroed on the rocket now.</i>

1040
01:42:56,566 --> 01:42:59,686
<i>We will now stay on
Mercury Spacecraft Control</i>

1041
01:42:59,820 --> 01:43:02,526
<i>- for the final countdown.
- Stand by.</i>

1042
01:43:02,658 --> 01:43:05,494
<i>Run to full power. Fuel elements 21.</i>

1043
01:43:05,619 --> 01:43:07,614
<i>Attention all controls.</i>

1044
01:43:07,915 --> 01:43:09,957
<i>Going into operation... now.</i>

1045
01:43:14,259 --> 01:43:16,253
<i>The umbilical is retracted. </i>

1046
01:43:16,387 --> 01:43:22,180
<i>All elements of operation have reported
that they are in good condition. </i>

1047
01:43:22,564 --> 01:43:26,563
<i>G minus one-nine seconds and counting. </i>

1048
01:43:30,491 --> 01:43:33,067
<i>G minus one-five and counting. </i>

1049
01:43:38,755 --> 01:43:39,918
<i>Ten... </i>

1050
01:43:40,048 --> 01:43:41,212
<i>Nine... </i>

1051
01:43:41,343 --> 01:43:42,457
<i>Eight... </i>

1052
01:43:42,593 --> 01:43:43,793
<i>Seven... </i>

1053
01:43:43,929 --> 01:43:45,009
<i>Six... </i>

1054
01:43:45,140 --> 01:43:48,179
<i>- Five... Four... Three...
- Shut down!</i>

1055
01:43:48,312 --> 01:43:50,436
<i>Two... One... </i>

1056
01:43:51,233 --> 01:43:53,025
<i>Zero! </i>

1057
01:43:58,536 --> 01:43:59,485
<i>Lift off! </i>

1058
01:44:46,320 --> 01:44:48,777
<i>The tower has been jettisoned. </i>

1059
01:44:49,283 --> 01:44:53,199
<i>It's a hunk. There's the rocket
against that grey sky, and it's green. </i>

1060
01:44:53,330 --> 01:44:57,378
<i>We can see the outline of the rocket.
The engines are burning. </i>

1061
01:44:57,505 --> 01:45:00,257
<i>You can hear the roar,
which still sounds good and true. </i>

1062
01:45:00,384 --> 01:45:04,301
<i>It's a very hot rocket. </i>

1063
01:45:04,432 --> 01:45:08,977
<i>You can see the flame of it
against the grey of the cumulus. </i>

1064
01:45:09,106 --> 01:45:11,893
<i>Up in the sunlight, beginning to gleam. </i>

1065
01:45:12,026 --> 01:45:13,936
<i>A very good, steady climb. </i>

1066
01:45:14,531 --> 01:45:18,447
<i>All systems go! Go! Go! </i>

1067
01:45:31,575 --> 01:45:33,616
<i>Honey! Honey!</i>

1068
01:45:40,465 --> 01:45:42,506
<i>Honey!</i>

1069
01:45:50,521 --> 01:45:53,727
<i>- Where's the girl I came in with?
- I don't know!</i>

1070
01:45:56,364 --> 01:45:58,608
<i>Where's the girl
they brought in with me?</i>

1071
01:45:58,743 --> 01:46:00,784
<i>- Number twelve.
- Show me.</i>

1072
01:47:35,275 --> 01:47:37,315
<i>We've run out of fuel.</i>

1073
01:47:41,117 --> 01:47:43,195
<i>What are we going to do now?</i>

1074
01:47:43,330 --> 01:47:45,370
<i>Well, we can swim, or, er...</i>

1075
01:47:46,458 --> 01:47:47,788
<i>Or what?</i>

1076
01:47:47,920 --> 01:47:49,960
<i>Come here.</i>

1077
01:48:03,151 --> 01:48:05,823
<i>Ahoy, Mr Bond! Ahoy, Mr Bond!</i>

1078
01:48:07,200 --> 01:48:09,110
<i>Well, well! What's the matter?</i>

1079
01:48:09,243 --> 01:48:11,284
<i>Do you need help?</i>

1080
01:48:13,752 --> 01:48:15,211
<i>I'm quite sure you don't.</i>

1081
01:48:15,336 --> 01:48:18,174
<i>Now that you're here,
you'd better give us a tow.</i>

1082
01:48:18,300 --> 01:48:20,544
<i>Throw us your line.</i>
