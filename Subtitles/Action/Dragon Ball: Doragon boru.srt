00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:12,030
Long ago, in an era
completely unknown to all...

2
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:20,840
On a certain mountain thousands
of miles from civilization,

3
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:27,070
there lived a lone boy who
communed with nature.

4
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:38,790
"Bulma and Son Goku"

5
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,350
Hiya!

6
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:09,320
Okay! All done making the firewood!

7
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:11,790
I sure am hungry...

8
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:34,760
It should be right around here somewhere...

9
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:52,020
Grandpa! I'm going out to catch food!

10
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:05,760
That's weird, I could swear
l saw you glowing...

11
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:08,590
Grandpa! Did you do something just now?

12
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:12,080
Weird!

13
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,140
Oh well.

14
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,640
What do I feel like eating?

15
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:24,990
I already had a bear the other day...

16
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:38,750
Yahoo!

17
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,390
Yummy!

18
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,550
This feels great!

19
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:49,830
That's it! I'll have some fish!

20
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:06,390
Time to eat!

21
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:18,390
I did it!

22
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:22,940
What a good haul!

23
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,350
What's that sound?

24
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,470
I hit him!

25
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:45,800
He's alive!

26
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:51,150
You evil beast! You're trying
to steal my food, aren't you?!

27
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:57,670
Well, I won't let you!

28
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:08,190
If you want my food, then come fight me!

29
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:12,630
How dare you, you monster!

30
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,870
Huh? There's a weird goblin
coming out of the beast!

31
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,390
You jerk!

32
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:29,670
What was that? Black magic?!

33
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:33,360
Yikes! Why aren't you dead?!

34
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:36,320
Don't be stupid! l'd never die that easy!

35
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:39,520
My body's as hard as steel!

36
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:42,190
Say goodbye, you evil goblin!

37
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:44,200
Goblin?!

38
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:47,740
Time out! I'm not a goblin! I'm a human!

39
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,390
Human...?

40
00:06:56,600 --> 00:07:00,950
lsn't it obvious? Have a good look! See?

41
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:02,920
Stop right there!

42
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:04,430
Don't move a muscle!

43
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,520
Are you human?!

44
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:15,240
Of course I am!

45
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:19,000
You don't seem like me,
you're soft and weak-looking...

46
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,440
Well, come on, I'm a girl!

47
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:24,270
A girl? You're a girl?

48
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,520
What a hick!

49
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:28,520
You've never seen a girl before?

50
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:32,300
No. You're the first human l've
seen besides me and Grandpa.

51
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:40,300
Grandpa told me that if I ever met l
girl, that I should be nice to her.

52
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:44,040
Sounds like good advice.

53
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:46,550
So you live together with your grandpa then?

54
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:48,910
He died a long time ago.

55
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:54,520
What're you doing, you little pervert?!

56
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:56,980
Girls don't even have tails?

57
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:01,990
How strange!

58
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:04,600
Talk about lame!

59
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:08,710
Does he think he's cool
with that tail accessory?

60
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:11,750
Did this beast catch you or something?

61
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:15,750
This isn't a beast! It's a car!

62
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:22,310
I heard about cars from Grandpa,
but this is what they look like?

63
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:26,750
You're really strong for someone so tiny.

64
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:29,630
Grandpa trained me!

65
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:35,320
Oh! If you were riding in this,
does that mean you're from the city?

66
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:36,640
Yeah.

67
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,360
Okay! Come to my house!

68
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:40,310
I'll make you some food
since you're a girl!

69
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,750
W-wait a second.

70
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:55,230
It's further down this path,
so does that mean he has it... ?

71
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:02,030
If so, then his power'll come in
really handy, even if he is weird... !

72
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:05,150
What's wrong? Don't you want
me to make you any food?

73
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:07,320
I'm coming.

74
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:10,070
But no funny business!

75
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:12,480
What's funny business?

76
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,270
Well, you know...

77
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:16,080
That's right!

78
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:20,510
This is the first time he's seen a girl,
so he doesn't know anything about that!

79
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:23,760
You sure are weird.

80
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,510
Oh well! Follow me!

81
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:33,590
By the way, what's your name?

82
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:36,840
Goku! Son Goku!

83
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:37,840
What about you?

84
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:40,270
Eh? Me?

85
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,440
Yeah!

86
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:43,720
Bulma.

87
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:45,560
Bulma?

88
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:46,960
What a funny name!

89
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:49,670
That's why I didn't wanna tell you!

90
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:52,350
Bulma!

91
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:57,310
Look, I don't like it either, you know!

92
00:09:57,520 --> 00:10:00,080
I hate kids!

93
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:18,420
Wait here.

94
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:26,200
Grandpa... !

95
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,520
What's the matter?

96
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:29,680
G-Grandpa's talking!

97
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:31,830
I thought your grandpa was dead...

98
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:36,830
There it is! The Dragon Ball!

99
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:39,190
Move!

100
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:42,260
Hey! Stop touching Grandpa!

101
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:45,260
Grandpa...? This?

102
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:50,120
Yeah! It's the only memento
of his that he left me!

103
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:52,150
Girls aren't allowed to touch it!

104
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:57,560
Look! He's glowing! It's
like he's talking excitedly!

105
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:59,240
That's the first time
l've seen him do that!

106
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:01,910
Oh well, I guess I'll let
you in on the secret.

107
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:04,320
Look!

108
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:07,670
It's Grandpa! You have two grandpas?!

109
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:10,550
These aren't grandpas,
they're Dragon Balls!

110
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:13,000
Dragon Balls...?

111
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:18,310
Yeah! Your Dragon Ball is
reacting to these two here.

112
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,830
Try putting yours next to them.

113
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:22,390
Okay...

114
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:27,350
See?

115
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,680
I found this ball in a
storeroom in my house.

116
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:34,680
I wondered what it was,
so I did some research

117
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:37,640
and found out they're
actually really amazing!

118
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:40,200
What's so amazing about them?

119
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,510
Want me to tell you?

120
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:45,200
Yeah.

121
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:45,910
Alright.

122
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,630
There it is!

123
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:05,150
So this is the legendary Dragon Ball?

124
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,840
So I just chant the words into this, right?

125
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:22,280
--No.
--Eh?

126
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:27,400
While that is a Dragon Ball, it's
completely useless by itself.

127
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:28,880
What?!

128
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:35,060
Pilaf-sama. There are seven
Dragon Balls in all...

129
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:37,910
Seven, huh...?

130
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:46,750
When all seven Dragon Balls
are brought together,

131
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:54,000
Shen Long - the lord of
the dragons - appears.

132
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,800
If you chant the words then,

133
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:59,270
then he will grant you any
single wish you want.

134
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:03,590
Any wish at all? lncredible!

135
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:07,790
I will use the Dragon Balls
to rule the world!

136
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:14,190
Wow!

137
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:19,360
Any wish will come true if you
collect all seven Dragon Balls?

138
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:22,630
I heard that someone once collected
them all and became a king!

139
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:25,560
But that was a really long time ago,

140
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:28,430
so it looks like they all got
separated again since then.

141
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:32,280
So you're trying to collect them all?

142
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:35,240
It was really hard, but ten days ago
l finally found this Five-Star Ball

143
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:37,160
in a valley to the north!

144
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:39,280
Grandpa's has four stars!

145
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:40,500
Which makes it the Four-Star Ball!

146
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:44,320
I already know what my wish is going to be!

147
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:47,120
Having an unlimited supply of
strawberries is hard to turn down,

148
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:50,150
but I'm going to wish for
a cute boyfriend instead!

149
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:53,560
So can I have that Four-Star Ball?

150
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:54,960
No way!

151
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:57,190
Grandpa gave this to me!

152
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:59,520
Cheapskate!

153
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:02,950
Come on, you're not going to use it anyway!

154
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:09,190
Oh, I get it! I know what you want!

155
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:16,150
How about this?
You can touch it if you'd like!

156
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:18,840
I don't wanna touch your dirty butt.

157
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:21,670
It is not dirty! How rude!

158
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:25,840
Yeah, why don't you help
me find the Dragon Balls?

159
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:29,270
Your grandpa did tell you
to be nice to girls, right?

160
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:31,280
Find the Dragon Balls?

161
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:33,400
You've got nothing to do here, after all.

162
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:36,350
And it's your duty as a man to go to
various places and train yourself!

163
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Do you think I can get strong
like Grandpa if I train?

164
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,480
Of course!

165
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:44,000
All you've ever seen are
these mountains, right?

166
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,880
You haven't even seen the ocean, have you?

167
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:48,520
There're towns where tons of people live,

168
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:51,200
and you'll even get to see
dinosaurs and monsters!

169
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:53,760
Sounds like fun! I think I'll go!

170
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:56,760
Great! It's decided then!

171
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:58,440
But you're not getting my ball!

172
00:14:58,440 --> 00:14:59,520
I'll hold on to it.

173
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:02,910
That's fine! I'll just need to borrow
it after we find the other ones...

174
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:05,160
This is looking good!

175
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:07,240
He'll make the perfect bodyguard,

176
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:09,750
and it doesn't matter as
long as I get my wish!

177
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:12,990
Time to set out on our
exciting adventure! Let's go!

178
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:19,550
But how do you find the other balls
if you don't know where they are?

179
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:23,360
That's what makes me so smart!

180
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:25,720
Though I'm cute too!

181
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:27,070
This!

182
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:32,520
The Dragon Radar. I made it myself!

183
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:36,160
Look! These three dots
are the balls we have.

184
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:38,000
The next one is over here.

185
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,950
Approximately 1200 kilometers to the west!

186
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:42,560
I don't get it.

187
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:44,760
We can't just walk there, though.

188
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:48,460
You totaled my car, so we'll
have to use something else...

189
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:53,150
Let's see... What number was it?

190
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:54,590
Number nine!

191
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:57,590
Get back.

192
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:05,800
Okay, let's go!

193
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:08,390
Yikes! You're a witch!

194
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:10,750
I knew it! You really are a witch!

195
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:13,200
What are you talking about?

196
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:18,220
These're called Hoi Poi Capsules;
everyone civilized uses them!

197
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:21,880
It's not black magic!

198
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:23,750
Just get in behind me already!

199
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:26,830
Ready? Here we go!

200
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:33,070
Wow! This goes a lot faster than I run!

201
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:35,910
Hey, watch where you're grabbing!

202
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:53,350
And so began Goku and Bulma's
fantastic and momentous adventure!

203
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:11,870
Wow! What an amazing technique!
We were flying!

204
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:13,480
I try my best... !

205
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:16,510
I didn't expect the slope to be that steep!

206
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:22,550
Sorry! Wait there, I'll be right back!

207
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:24,240
Why? Where are you going?

208
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:25,480
You sure are dimwitted, huh?!

209
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:28,670
When a lady says that, she's
obviously going to take a leak!

210
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:31,160
Oh, you need to go pee?

211
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:33,110
No following me!

212
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:36,480
But she could've gone pee right here...

213
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:38,550
She sure is weird.

214
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:46,190
What's wrong? Did a snake bite your wiener?!

215
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:54,150
Who are you?!

216
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:57,390
I'm Goku. Are you a friend of hers?

217
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,440
Why, yes.

218
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:07,630
We have some things to
discuss now, so you wait here!

219
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:15,520
Huh? I'm all tied up.

220
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:18,710
Well, thanks a bunch! Bye now!

221
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:24,000
It's been so long since l've had human meat!

222
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,990
I'm gonna take my time eating you!

223
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:31,160
Hey! How long should I wait?!

224
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:33,390
What're you doing?! Save me!

225
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:36,440
ldiot! Moron! Blockhead!

226
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:39,280
Oh, you want me to save you?

227
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:41,470
You should've said so sooner!

228
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:48,110
But now what do I do? I can't fly...

229
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:50,470
That's right!

230
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:53,160
I wonder if I can ride this...

231
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:56,510
I think she twisted this thing hard...

232
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:01,720
I did it! It's moving!

233
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:03,350
Okay!

234
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:14,270
Here goes!

235
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:24,510
I'll do it from here!

236
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:28,110
Goku!

237
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:36,840
What a fool!

238
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:38,790
Extend, pole!

239
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:45,030
Have a taste of my Nyoibou!

240
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:58,470
Help me... !

241
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:00,070
Okay!

242
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:16,660
I guess I didn't save her after all...

243
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:27,630
I wound up taking a leak anyway... !

244
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:29,750
Good for you!

245
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:37,200
Goku and Bulma's journey has just begun.

246
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:41,390
What awaits them next on their adventure?

247
