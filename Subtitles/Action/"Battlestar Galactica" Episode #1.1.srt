There'll always be rumours.
For most people, that's all they'll ever be.

plus three Marines.

Once this gets out officially...

of being Cylons for no reason at all.

how're we doing on the screenings?

885
01:05:29,638 --> 01:05:32,789
To tell you the truth,
there are significant problems...

886
01:05:32,878 --> 01:05:35,392
with implementing
my Cylon detection method...

887

that l used aboard Galactica previously...

888
01:05:37,638 --> 01:05:40,357
and basically because
l've run out of natural resources.

889
01:05:40,438 --> 01:05:44,113
l need chemical compounds.
For example, the precursor test.

890
01:05:44,198 --> 01:05:47,349
l need large samples of tetrahydrocycline...

891

Your intellect obviously outstrips
everyone in this room.

894

But it's also obvious
by the way that you're talking...

895
01:06:02,918 --> 01:06:05,955
that in order to make
large-scale screenings...

896

But the need for secrecy?

905
01:06:37,758 --> 01:06:41,387
Clearly, this falls
into the ''absolutely necessary'' category.

may be critical to our very survival.

02:26:20,452 --> 02:26:24,889
[Eerie instrumental music]

2003
02:26:48,452 --> 02:26:52,047
-Madame President.
-Would you close that curtain, please?

2004
02:26:57,252 --> 02:26:58,287
ROSLlN: Thank you.

2005
02:26:58,372 --> 02:27:02,729
You are obviously an intelligent,
well-educated young woman.

2006
02:27:03,052 --> 02:27:06,044
Would you mind explaining to me why
you waited five years...

2007
02:27:06,132 --> 02:27:07,724
in between breast exams?

2008
02:27:07,812 --> 02:27:10,929
Yes, l would mind.
lt's none of your business.

2009
02:27:12,132 --> 02:27:13,485
l was busy.

2010
02:27:14,932 --> 02:27:17,969
-And now, here you are.
-Yes. Here we are.

2011
02:27:18,732 --> 02:27:21,929
-Would you mind?
-l do, actually.

2012
02:27:22,972 --> 02:27:25,406
Your doctor back on Caprica was right.

2013
02:27:25,492 --> 02:27:28,450
lt's too damn late to operate,
the cancer is too far advanced.

2014
02:27:28,532 --> 02:27:31,888
DOC COTTLE: We can try to shrink
the tumour with gamma treatments...

2015
02:27:31,972 --> 02:27:34,202
and follow that up with lV cis-Doloxan.

2016
02:27:34,292 --> 02:27:38,001
Did he explain to you the side-effects
of Doloxan?

2017
02:27:38,252 --> 02:27:40,243
Hair loss, nausea, muscle degeneration.

2018
02:27:40,332 --> 02:27:43,847
l watched my mother endure two years
of Doloxan before she died.

2019
02:27:44,932 --> 02:27:47,844
l would like to explore alternate treatment.

2020
02:27:48,692 --> 02:27:50,410
DOC COTTLE: Prayer?
ROSLlN: Witty.

2021
02:27:51,412 --> 02:27:54,165
Have you ever heard of Chamalla extract?

2022
02:27:54,692 --> 02:27:58,321
DOC COTTLE: Gods. You're one of those.
ROSLlN: What if it works?

2023
02:28:01,452 --> 02:28:04,091
All the evidence on Chamalla is anecdotal.

2024
02:28:04,172 --> 02:28:07,323
DOC COTTLE: lt's nothing but a bunch
of loose talk and false hope.

2025
02:28:07,412 --> 02:28:09,209
ROSLlN: l'll take that as a yes.

2026
02:28:12,332 --> 02:28:13,651
All right.

2027
02:28:13,972 --> 02:28:17,123
l'll put out a med request
to the civilian fleet.

2028
02:28:17,652 --> 02:28:20,962
Maybe there's some other wide-eyed dreamer
out there...

2029
02:28:21,052 --> 02:28:24,442
with a secret horde of Chamalla extract
in their luggage.

2030
02:28:25,452 --> 02:28:28,285
DOC COTTLE: Put your clothes back on now.
ROSLlN: Thank you.

2031
02:28:32,372 --> 02:28:34,408
DOC COTTLE: And for what it's worth...

2032
02:28:35,372 --> 02:28:39,729
l would seriously consider prayer.

2033
02:28:46,772 --> 02:28:49,127
Boonie jumpers. Shuttle jockies.

2034
02:28:49,772 --> 02:28:53,526
And a Fleet Academy wash-out. This is
the best that you could come up with?

2035
02:28:53,612 --> 02:28:56,046
-Diamonds in the rough.
-Yeah, right.

2036
02:28:56,132 --> 02:28:58,646
APOLLO: They're the most qualified pilots
in the fleet.

2037
02:28:58,732 --> 02:28:59,847
STARBUCK: Great!

2038
02:29:02,172 --> 02:29:03,844
STARBUCK: Attention on deck.

2039
02:29:06,972 --> 02:29:10,123
That means get on your feet, nuggets!

2040
02:29:14,092 --> 02:29:18,688
You are joining the Colonial Fleet,
boys and girls, not some after-school club.

2041
02:29:18,772 --> 02:29:19,921
Seats.

2042
02:29:25,452 --> 02:29:28,683
STARBUCK: Pilots call me Starbuck,
but you may refer to me as God.

2043
02:29:28,772 --> 02:29:32,128
You've all flown before, but you're about
to enter a whole new world...

2044
02:29:32,212 --> 02:29:33,645
so pay attention.

2045
02:29:33,732 --> 02:29:35,962
We don't have any flight simulators
on board...

2046
02:29:36,052 --> 02:29:39,044
so we're putting you into the cockpit, today.

2047
02:29:42,892 --> 02:29:44,689
This is the Viper Mark II.

2048
02:29:44,772 --> 02:29:48,003
lt's as manoeuvrable as a jack-rabbit,
and can flip end for end...

2049
02:29:48,092 --> 02:29:50,287
in 0.35 seconds.

2050
02:29:50,612 --> 02:29:54,127
You've never flown anything remotely like it,
so don't think that you have.

2051
02:29:54,212 --> 02:29:57,761
STARBUCK: Today we'll do basic launch,
approach, and landing manoeuvres...

2052
02:29:57,852 --> 02:30:00,650
and anyone not paying attention
is liable to end up...

2053
02:30:00,732 --> 02:30:05,567
as a puddle or something to be hosed
out of the cockpit by the chief of the deck.

2054
02:30:07,412 --> 02:30:09,687
She's laying it on a little thick.

2055
02:30:10,292 --> 02:30:14,046
STARBUCK: Costanza, right?
COSTANZA: Yes, God, sir.

2056
02:30:14,132 --> 02:30:17,329
Not anymore.
From now on, your name is ''Hot Dog.''

2057
02:30:17,412 --> 02:30:20,165
And when God speaks, Hot Dog, you listen.

2058
02:30:20,252 --> 02:30:24,131
Maybe if you had learned that at
the Academy, you wouldn't have washed out.

2059
02:30:28,932 --> 02:30:30,206
Sit up!

2060
02:30:36,372 --> 02:30:40,331
LSO: Viper 791 Galactica,
you are cleared for approach.

2061
02:30:41,852 --> 02:30:45,128
LSO: Speed 175 port bay,
hands on approach...

2062
02:30:45,212 --> 02:30:47,442
checkers green. Call the ball.

2063
02:30:50,492 --> 02:30:52,164
l have the ball.

2064
02:30:52,372 --> 02:30:54,090
STARBUCK: Easy on the throttle, Kat.

2065
02:30:55,532 --> 02:30:59,002
STARBUCK: Are you listening to me?
Don't chase the lights, okay?

2066
02:30:59,612 --> 02:31:02,649
KAT: Roger, Starbuck.
STARBUCK: Kat, don't chase the lights!

2067
02:31:02,732 --> 02:31:05,451
Set it by the numbers
and correct with thrusters.

2068
02:31:09,652 --> 02:31:11,529
LSO: Wave-off!

2069
02:31:13,652 --> 02:31:14,846
Punch it, Kat!

2070
02:31:22,452 --> 02:31:26,764
Worse than awful.
Wretched beyond belief, actually.

2071
02:31:27,772 --> 02:31:29,490
STARBUCK: You call yourselves pilots.

2072
02:31:29,652 --> 02:31:33,964
It'll take the knuckle draggers a week to
pound your divots out of the flight deck.

2073
02:31:34,052 --> 02:31:38,330
-With due respect, sir, that's unfair.
-Yes, sir. This was only our first day.

2074
02:31:40,732 --> 02:31:42,768
No. lt's your last.

2075
02:31:43,372 --> 02:31:46,205
lt would be criminal to let any of you
near a Viper again.

2076
02:31:46,572 --> 02:31:49,769
So pack your gear and
get the hell off my ship. You're done.

2077
02:32:07,532 --> 02:32:09,363
What are you doing here, Kara?

2078
02:32:09,452 --> 02:32:12,683
-You can't wash them out on their first day.
-l just did.

2079
02:32:14,452 --> 02:32:17,888
Look, l got 40 Vipers, and 21 pilots.
That's it.

2080
02:32:18,532 --> 02:32:20,841
We are sitting ducks
until we finish water-op's.

2081
02:32:20,932 --> 02:32:25,005
We can't even maintain a CAP.
And Gods forbid the Cylons show up.

2082
02:32:25,812 --> 02:32:29,407
Gods forbid.
Let's bring in the next group of candidates.

2083
02:32:29,612 --> 02:32:32,729
The next group has never even been
in a cockpit.

2084
02:32:33,492 --> 02:32:37,007
-They're starting basic flight.
-Then they start basic flight.

2085
02:32:37,092 --> 02:32:39,560
Because that group is done.
lt says so right there.

2086
02:32:39,652 --> 02:32:41,449
Maybe you should read it again.

2087
02:32:42,572 --> 02:32:46,565
APOLLO: Lt. Thrace, this is not a request.
STARBUCK: Well, Capt. Adama!

2088
02:32:46,812 --> 02:32:50,487
l am the flight instructor, sir.
My word is scripture, sir.

2089
02:32:50,772 --> 02:32:54,560
STARBUCK: l will not, repeat, not pass
another student who isn't ready.

2090
02:32:55,572 --> 02:32:57,369
So, that's what this is about.

2091
02:32:58,092 --> 02:33:01,164
lt's not them. lt's Zak.

2092
02:33:04,732 --> 02:33:06,211
Careful.

2093
02:33:07,652 --> 02:33:09,449
Step back.

2094
02:33:22,692 --> 02:33:25,729
[Pants and grunts]

2095
02:33:34,612 --> 02:33:35,601
[Grunts]

2096
02:33:41,692 --> 02:33:44,570
ADAMA: Starbuck says they can't cut it,
they can't cut it.

2097
02:33:44,652 --> 02:33:46,882
She's not giving them a chance. lt's Day 1 .

2098
02:33:46,972 --> 02:33:49,964
She's one of the finest pilots
l've ever seen in my life.

2099
02:33:50,092 --> 02:33:53,641
One day in the cockpit is all she needs
to know if they can hack it or not.

2100
02:33:53,732 --> 02:33:56,530
ADAMA: She got that.
APOLLO: l'm not arguing that, sir.

2101
02:33:56,932 --> 02:34:01,050
l'm just saying that l think she's letting her
personal feelings cloud her judgment.

2102
02:34:01,132 --> 02:34:03,123
Please sit down, Captain.

2103
02:34:05,812 --> 02:34:07,803
ADAMA: What are those feelings?

2104
02:34:11,092 --> 02:34:12,491
About Zak.

2105
02:34:14,092 --> 02:34:16,890
-We've talked about, Zak.
-You did?

2106
02:34:16,972 --> 02:34:19,088
ADAMA: We've talked about a lot of things.

2107
02:34:19,172 --> 02:34:22,926
We've been aboard this ship for over
two years. We know each other very well.

2108
02:34:23,852 --> 02:34:26,002
When l asked her to be the instructor...

2109
02:34:26,092 --> 02:34:29,528
l knew it was going to release
a lot of loose baggage.

2110
02:34:30,092 --> 02:34:34,404
She acknowledged it.
She's a professional. She'll do her job.

2111
02:34:38,292 --> 02:34:39,281
Okay.

2112
02:34:41,612 --> 02:34:45,161
l'm just saying that you should talk to her.

2113
02:34:45,252 --> 02:34:47,561
APOLLO: She's walking around
with a lot of emotion.

2114
02:34:47,652 --> 02:34:50,166
She almost decked me in the rec room.

2115
02:34:51,652 --> 02:34:55,008
Right. You wouldn't smile if you were there.

2116
02:34:55,892 --> 02:34:57,962
-l'll talk to her.
-Thank you.

2117
02:35:00,972 --> 02:35:02,451
Personally...

2118
02:35:02,892 --> 02:35:06,646
l think she's trying to work out her guilt
over what she did for Zak.

2119
02:35:06,732 --> 02:35:10,008
l think she's making up for it
by beating up on these guys.

2120
02:35:10,092 --> 02:35:12,686
Guilt? Over what?

2121
02:35:13,412 --> 02:35:15,289
What did she do for Zak?

2122
02:35:17,492 --> 02:35:20,404
-l thought you just said--
-What did she do?

2123
02:35:25,292 --> 02:35:29,205
lt's not my place to say and l've already said
more than l should have.

2124
02:35:30,012 --> 02:35:33,322
-You'll have to ask her. l'm sorry.
-Captain, just--

2125
02:35:33,412 --> 02:35:35,482
Dad, you'll have to ask her.

2126
02:35:38,012 --> 02:35:40,003
ZAK: I don't want any special treatment.

2127
02:35:40,092 --> 02:35:43,368
Not from my father,
and certainly not from you.

2128
02:35:55,692 --> 02:35:57,250
You passed.

2129
02:35:57,492 --> 02:36:00,131
By the skin of your teeth, but you passed.

2130
02:36:01,892 --> 02:36:04,645
DUALLA: Attention.
Pass the word to Lt. Thrace.

2131
02:36:04,732 --> 02:36:07,724
Lt. Thrace, please report
to the CO's quarters.

2132
02:36:19,852 --> 02:36:21,285
Yes. Come in.

2133
02:36:22,692 --> 02:36:25,445
ADAMA: Lee was just here before.
STARBUCK: l knew it.

2134
02:36:30,252 --> 02:36:32,720
He thinks you washed out...

2135
02:36:33,332 --> 02:36:35,721
the nuggets without giving them a chance.

2136
02:36:36,652 --> 02:36:38,882
They didn't cut it. That's it.

2137
02:36:42,932 --> 02:36:47,483
He thought you were letting
personal feelings cloud your judgment.

2138
02:36:50,452 --> 02:36:53,012
STARBUCK: Really?
ADAMA: Your feelings about Zak.

2139
02:36:54,452 --> 02:36:56,204
That's not the case.

2140
02:36:59,292 --> 02:37:00,281
Okay.

2141
02:37:02,652 --> 02:37:04,643
ADAMA: He said something else.

2142
02:37:06,372 --> 02:37:10,160
He said something that
l would like to ask you directly.

2143
02:37:15,012 --> 02:37:19,767
ADAMA: He said that you might be feeling
guilty about something that you did for Zak.

2144
02:37:20,772 --> 02:37:22,728
What did you do for him?

2145
02:37:23,532 --> 02:37:26,968
STARBUCK: l don't know. Ask Lee.
ADAMA: l'm asking you.

2146
02:37:27,572 --> 02:37:29,005
l don't know....

2147
02:37:29,692 --> 02:37:32,160
l don't really know
what he was talking about, so--

2148
02:37:32,252 --> 02:37:34,288
Don't fence with me, Kara.

2149
02:37:35,092 --> 02:37:38,243
l love you like a daughter.
l don't deserve that.

2150
02:37:50,132 --> 02:37:54,364
Zak failed basic flight.

2151
02:37:59,132 --> 02:38:02,568
He wasn't a bad pilot.
He just had no feel for flying.

2152
02:38:09,292 --> 02:38:13,410
And when it came to his final check-ride,
he busted...

2153
02:38:14,572 --> 02:38:16,722
three of the test manoeuvres.

2154
02:38:17,372 --> 02:38:19,966
And l should have flunked him, but l didn't.

2155
02:38:24,612 --> 02:38:27,490
The bottom line is that your son...

2156
02:38:29,492 --> 02:38:32,165
didn't have the chops to fly a Viper.

2157
02:38:34,852 --> 02:38:36,524
And it killed him.

2158
02:38:41,012 --> 02:38:44,163
ADAMA: He told me that you were
an amazing instructor.

2159
02:38:46,012 --> 02:38:49,641
And that he was involved with you,
and that it was serious.

2160
02:38:50,092 --> 02:38:53,767
He asked me to come to his graduation
from flight school...

2161
02:38:54,332 --> 02:38:58,086
-to watch him get his wings.
