00:26:27,833 --> 00:26:30,874
You're like a mighty ancient oak.

360
00:26:54,416 --> 00:26:56,665
Half now. Half later.

361
00:27:05,708 --> 00:27:07,040
Do you want me to drive?
You seem a little--

362
00:27:07,125 --> 00:27:08,165
I'm upset.

363
00:27:10,291 --> 00:27:11,957
These are in the way.

364
00:27:12,041 --> 00:27:13,915
You stole his boots?

365
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,332
He doesn't need them anymore,
does he?

366
00:27:15,416 --> 00:27:16,790
Shit!

367
00:27:16,875 --> 00:27:18,582
(HORNS HONKING)

368
00:27:18,666 --> 00:27:20,832
How come you have a gun?

369
00:27:20,916 --> 00:27:23,457
Oh--that's--that's for work.

370
00:27:23,541 --> 00:27:24,624
What work?

371
00:27:24,708 --> 00:27:27,082
I'm an undercover private detective.

372
00:27:27,166 --> 00:27:31,665
You just don't look like the type.
What were you doing in here?

373
00:27:31,750 --> 00:27:34,374
I was watching a client's wife.

374
00:27:34,458 --> 00:27:39,165
She had a tryst in a--in--
with a man in a car on the fifth floor.

375
00:27:39,250 --> 00:27:41,040
(LAUGHS) A tryst?

376
00:27:41,125 --> 00:27:44,999
I've given you a down payment.
How much for the week?

377
00:27:45,083 --> 00:27:47,415
A week?
I'm too expensive.

378
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:49,957
-How much?
-30 thousand.

379
00:27:50,041 --> 00:27:52,665
All right, 30 thou.
I'm gonna get out of here.

380
00:27:52,750 --> 00:27:55,707
I want round-the-clock protection.

381
00:27:55,791 --> 00:27:57,499
I'm sorry, no.

382
00:27:59,666 --> 00:28:01,249
Get down!

383
00:28:01,333 --> 00:28:04,290
-Quick! Back up, run him over!
-You must be kidding!

384
00:28:04,375 --> 00:28:07,207
Agh! Ow!

385
00:28:09,125 --> 00:28:10,665
-Hang on!
-He's fine!

386
00:28:10,750 --> 00:28:13,332
What are you doing?!Get in!

387
00:28:15,083 --> 00:28:16,624
Get in!Get in!

388
00:28:16,708 --> 00:28:18,957
I can't see!

389
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:22,082
I just saved your life!
You almost killed me!

390
00:28:22,166 --> 00:28:24,665
So we're quits. Oh shit! Shit!

391
00:28:24,750 --> 00:28:25,707
-Floor it!
-What?!

392
00:28:25,791 --> 00:28:27,582
Now!!

393
00:28:32,041 --> 00:28:32,832
Oh, my god!

394
00:28:37,250 --> 00:28:38,332
Where now?

395
00:28:38,416 --> 00:28:40,332
Third street on the right.
We'll get across town.

396
00:28:40,416 --> 00:28:43,290
-Well, then what?
-A discreet hotel. We need to lie low.

397
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:51,249
Discreet?
How about ridiculously overpriced?

398
00:28:51,333 --> 00:28:54,124
They'll be checking the cheaper hotels.
No one will look for us here.

399
00:28:59,958 --> 00:29:01,040
Three...

400
00:29:02,958 --> 00:29:04,790
Three rooms, please.

401
00:29:04,875 --> 00:29:07,040
Of course, sir.
What name?

402
00:29:07,125 --> 00:29:10,957
Smith.

403
00:29:11,041 --> 00:29:13,957
You have the same name?

404
00:29:14,041 --> 00:29:16,415
-And your name, sir?
-Tony.

405
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:18,374
We'll just take the one room.

406
00:29:20,041 --> 00:29:21,457
Excuse me.

407
00:29:21,541 --> 00:29:23,165
What? Ow.

408
00:29:24,458 --> 00:29:26,707
-You can't be serious.
-Who's paying for this?

409
00:29:26,791 --> 00:29:29,082
-You said you had plenty of money.
-Yeah, and I mean to keep it that way.

410
00:29:29,166 --> 00:29:31,540
I'm sorry, I really can't sleep
in a r¤om with someone else.

411
00:29:31,625 --> 00:29:33,124
Well, I can't imagine
you get many requests.

412
00:29:33,208 --> 00:29:35,957
-I'll pay for my own room.
-It's not about the money, all right?

413
00:29:36,041 --> 00:29:37,832
Round-the-clock protection, we said.

414
00:29:37,916 --> 00:29:39,582
How are you going to protect me
from another room? No.

415
00:29:39,666 --> 00:29:42,457
-Wait!
-No. One room. One room's fine.

416
00:29:42,541 --> 00:29:46,915
Why don't you settle this in 322?
It's one of our cheapest.

417
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,165
Are you sure this is a safe place?

418
00:29:49,250 --> 00:29:51,957
Of course I'm sure.
I leave nothing to chance.

419
00:29:54,166 --> 00:29:56,374
-Ah, Laetitia.
-Good morning, boss.

420
00:29:56,458 --> 00:29:58,832
-Have you seen Mike?
-Sorry, Mr. Ferguson, no.

(SIGHS) Where is he?

422
00:30:07,250 --> 00:30:09,290
-Thank you, sir.
-Mmm.

423
00:30:09,375 --> 00:30:11,040
-May I say...
-Oh, here we go...

424
00:30:11,125 --> 00:30:13,290
It would help ifyou could manage
to behave with a little more decorum.

425
00:30:13,375 --> 00:30:14,415
Hey, they have cable.

426
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:17,207
Three adults in one room,
a miniscule room in a luxury hotel?

427
00:30:17,291 --> 00:30:19,249
-So what?
-So you got us noticed!

Already the home team's defence
is looking rather nervous, Andy.

429

in the early stages.

Outside coming forward again...

432
00:30:29,708 --> 00:30:31,874
with killers after you,
you're discreet.

433
00:30:31,958 --> 00:30:35,665
You hide.
You don't yell in hotel lobbies.

434
00:30:35,750 --> 00:30:38,957
Oh, that's a beautiful move.

435
00:30:39,041 --> 00:30:42,457
Putting together a few passes now.
That's it!

436
00:30:45,083 --> 00:30:47,165
Oh, and he puts it wide!

437
00:30:47,250 --> 00:30:49,957
My goodness,
he'll be kicking himself.

438
00:30:50,041 --> 00:30:52,207
Which side do you sleep on?

439
00:30:52,291 --> 00:30:53,499
What?

440
00:30:53,583 --> 00:30:56,332
I don't. I keep watch.

441
00:30:56,416 --> 00:30:59,207
Tony, you sleep with her.

442
00:30:59,291 --> 00:31:00,915
Whatever.

443

please respect my living space.

444

This... is my area.

445
00:31:08,333 --> 00:31:11,082
Time's just going to fly by,
I can tell.

446
00:31:11,166 --> 00:31:12,915
Now just you change your tune,
young lady.

447
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,749
You were a lot less lippy
in the car-park,

448
00:31:14,833 --> 00:31:16,207
sobbing about ancient oaks.

449
00:31:16,291 --> 00:31:18,540
-I didn't beg you to come, remember.
-I didn't beg.

450

Offering a man 30,000 pounds
to spend a week with you

451
00:31:20,833 --> 00:31:22,457
is scarcely playing hard-to-get.

452
00:31:22,541 --> 00:31:25,040
Incredible,
I have only known you for three hours,

453
00:31:25,125 --> 00:31:26,832
and already it would take me
three days

454
00:31:26,916 --> 00:31:29,290
to list everything
that I hate about you.

00:31:35,958 --> 00:31:38,832
Perhaps he should have done
betterthan that.

Are you sure you won't come?

459
00:31:46,750 --> 00:31:49,790

00:31:59,750 --> 00:32:01,957
One thing though, Mr. Smith.

464
00:32:02,041 --> 00:32:04,915
-Yeah?
-Did I hear you say she's paying you?

465
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:08,207
-You did.
-I haven't got any money.

466
00:32:08,291 --> 00:32:10,749
Don't worry.
I'll look after you for free.

467
00:32:10,833 --> 00:32:12,082
In fact...

468
00:32:14,458 --> 00:32:15,957
you can help me look after her.

Great, probably need
all the help you can get.

470
00:32:22,125 --> 00:32:23,999
So I'll be your assistant?

471
00:32:25,541 --> 00:32:27,624
Apprentice.

472
00:32:30,083 --> 00:32:34,290
You know, Tony,
you're a fine young man.

473
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:39,790
Um...

474
00:32:41,875 --> 00:32:44,582
That's all.

475
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,957
There you are.

476
00:32:53,041 --> 00:32:55,207
I was wondering
what the two ofyou were up to.

477
00:32:57,458 --> 00:33:02,999
I'm sorry, before,
I was unpleasant and--

478
00:33:04,125 --> 00:33:05,499
and hostile even.

479
00:33:05,583 --> 00:33:07,124
I'm not usually like that.

480
00:33:07,208 --> 00:33:08,832
Oh, don't worry.

481
00:33:08,916 --> 00:33:11,957
I was aggressive
and annoying and, um,

482
00:33:12,041 --> 00:33:13,790
I'm quite often like that.

483
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,499
No. You can be pleasant.

484
00:33:18,583 --> 00:33:19,957
-Really?
-Yeah.

485
00:33:20,041 --> 00:33:21,165
When?

00:33:23,625 --> 00:33:25,582
I can't think
of an example right now but...

487
00:33:25,666 --> 00:33:27,165
Great. Thank you.

488
00:33:31,375 --> 00:33:35,249
Now.
Now you're being pleasant.

489
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:39,540
You're not listening.

490
00:33:39,625 --> 00:33:40,957
I am.

491
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:43,999
What were you were saying?

492
00:33:44,083 --> 00:33:47,082
I was saying you were pleasant
then for seven or eight seconds.

493
00:33:47,166 --> 00:33:49,582
You're eyeing up the barman.

494
00:33:49,666 --> 00:33:53,040
Yeah. He fancies me.
Is that bothering you?

495
00:33:53,125 --> 00:33:54,332
As a matter offact.

496
00:33:54,416 --> 00:33:57,124
Why? Do you fancy me?

497
00:33:57,208 --> 00:33:59,540
-What?
-It's a simple enough question.

498
00:33:59,625 --> 00:34:02,082
Of course not.
Not at all.

499
00:34:02,166 --> 00:34:04,124
Okay, that's what I thought.

500
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:13,707
Do you fancy him?
Is that it?

501
00:34:15,125 --> 00:34:18,040
No, it is not,
I would simply like you to listen

502
00:34:18,125 --> 00:34:19,415
ifwe're having a conversation,
that's all.

503
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:22,499

with the barman,

ifyou want to.

505
00:34:24,916 --> 00:34:27,457
-It's none of my business.
-You're unbelievable.

Hi, um, can I have a large Glenfiddich,
and a cognac,

507
00:34:37,958 --> 00:34:41,957
and a Belvedere, and a Becks,

508
00:34:42,041 --> 00:34:43,957
and two small red wines
and some peanuts.

509
00:34:44,041 --> 00:34:45,457
Not all for you.

510
00:34:45,541 --> 00:34:49,207
No, the Becks is for you.
And my father will pay.

511
00:35:06,708 --> 00:35:08,749
What do you weigh?

You know, Mike?

514
00:35:24,041 --> 00:35:27,290
You are the only genuine one
in all this.

515
00:35:29,333 --> 00:35:31,582
Genuine asshole.

516
00:35:31,666 --> 00:35:33,915
It's not my fault.

517
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,957
Not your fault?

518
00:35:36,041 --> 00:35:40,207
You said not to hire another hit man.
You said you'd handle it with Barney.

519
00:35:40,291 --> 00:35:45,249
And now I'm left with one bodyguard.

520
00:35:46,125 --> 00:35:47,707

Oh, stop shaking!

523
00:35:51,416 --> 00:35:55,999
Why are you shaking?
You think I'm angry with you, hm?

524
00:35:56,875 --> 00:36:00,957
Do you think that I'm going to hit you?
Is that it?

525
00:36:01,041 --> 00:36:03,499
It's funny.

than anger.

are next to nil.

00:36:27,583 --> 00:36:29,165
I am sad.

532
00:36:32,250 --> 00:36:33,582
You're sad, too.

533
00:36:40,833 --> 00:36:43,499
I don't like to see sad people.
Go to the bathroom.

534
00:36:57,708 --> 00:36:59,499
You just stay away from me.

535
00:36:59,583 --> 00:37:00,957
You ruined my evening.

536
00:37:01,041 --> 00:37:03,582
-Really.
-I was making friends.

537
00:37:03,666 --> 00:37:05,624
You were making a spectacle of
yourself.

538
00:37:05,708 --> 00:37:09,082
Do you have any friends, I wonder?
No, I can't imagine that you do.

539
00:37:11,541 --> 00:37:14,332
Sorry.
Sorry, wrong room.

540
00:37:14,416 --> 00:37:15,374
No problem.

541
00:37:22,833 --> 00:37:25,582
Why are you always in the way?

542
00:37:28,708 --> 00:37:31,124
-I fell asleep.
-That's all right.

543
00:37:31,208 --> 00:37:34,582
Of course, everything he does
is all right, isn't it?

544
00:37:34,666 --> 00:37:36,915
Hey, you scuffed those boots!

545
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,665
Ignore her, she's drunk.

546
00:37:38,750 --> 00:37:40,874
Still, my reactions will be quicker
now I've rested.

547
00:37:40,958 --> 00:37:44,832
In case anything happens,
I can stay up with you.

548
00:37:44,916 --> 00:37:47,582
-We can take it in turns.
-Fantastic, the two musketeers.

549
00:37:51,208 --> 00:37:52,915
TONY: Hey, what are you doing?

550
00:37:54,166 --> 00:37:56,665
-Putting them out to be cleaned.
-Someone'll steal them.

551
00:37:56,750 --> 00:37:58,832
God,
you're not in the YMCA now.

552
00:38:13,666 --> 00:38:15,665
And don't you try anything.

553
00:38:57,250 --> 00:38:59,540
Right, who's going to take
the first...

554
00:39:01,125 --> 00:39:02,374
watch.

555
00:39:30,041 --> 00:39:31,707
Boss?

556
00:39:31,791 --> 00:39:33,415
What? He's here.

557
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:34,624
Good.

558
00:39:34,708 --> 00:39:37,374
Tell him to wait.
Shan't be long.

559
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:41,540
Do you want anything?

560
00:39:43,541 --> 00:39:45,332
Just some coffee.

561
00:39:45,416 --> 00:39:47,207
Can we just go?

562
00:39:50,625 --> 00:39:53,124
Would you please
let me go first?

563
00:39:58,416 --> 00:40:00,165
-All clear.
-You don't say.

564
00:40:03,583 --> 00:40:05,957
(CHUCKLES)
So it's a quite extraordinary story.

565
00:40:06,041 --> 00:40:10,707
The man I hired to do the job
kills one of my men,

566
00:40:10,791 --> 00:40:15,290
grotesquely maims another,
and is now protecting the girl.

567
00:40:16,916 --> 00:40:19,249
Needless to say,
you're to get rid of both ofthem.

568
00:40:19,333 --> 00:40:20,790
Should've called me sooner.

569
00:40:20,875 --> 00:40:23,165
We tried to handle it ourselves.

570
00:40:23,250 --> 00:40:26,124
-(CHUCKLES) So I see.
-They killed Barney!

571
00:40:26,208 --> 00:40:27,415
Mike...

572
00:40:28,791 --> 00:40:32,957
I can't look at you right now.
Go and buy me some cigarettes.

573
00:40:35,666 --> 00:40:37,415
Would you feed our meter?

574
00:40:38,416 --> 00:40:40,165
Feed your own sodding meter.

575
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:45,082
And the name ofthis man
who has caused you so much trouble?

576
00:40:45,166 --> 00:40:47,582
I don't know his name.
We never met.

577
00:40:47,666 --> 00:40:50,790
Can you tell me anything
about him at all?

578
00:40:50,875 --> 00:40:52,457
Mike saw him.

579
00:40:52,541 --> 00:40:54,832
Describe him.

580
00:40:54,916 --> 00:40:57,165
Taller than average.

581
00:40:57,250 --> 00:40:59,707
Thinner than average,
average looks.

582
00:40:59,791 --> 00:41:01,374
Average moustache.

583
00:41:01,458 --> 00:41:03,707
Victor Maynard.

584
00:41:03,791 --> 00:41:05,999
You know him?
You know where he is?

585
00:41:06,083 --> 00:41:07,749
No, no one knows him.

586
00:41:07,833 --> 00:41:09,790
No one ever sees him,
not even his clients.

587
00:41:09,875 --> 00:41:11,290
He's old-school.

588
00:41:11,375 --> 00:41:13,249
So how come
you know what he looks like?

589
00:41:15,541 --> 00:41:17,499
-Rumor.
-Oh.

590
00:41:17,583 --> 00:41:21,082
In our line, we're--
how can I put this?

591
00:41:21,166 --> 00:41:23,540
The two most expensive.

592
00:41:23,625 --> 00:41:25,832
Actually, uh...

593
00:41:25,916 --> 00:41:28,499
he's a little bit more expensive
then you are.

594
00:41:32,958 --> 00:41:34,832
We'll find out if he's worth it at last.

595
00:41:54,625 --> 00:41:57,915
Help yourself.
Anything but the sausage.

596
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,624
Such largesse.

597
00:42:01,041 --> 00:42:04,624
Why don't you just settle the bill?
All right?

598
00:42:04,708 --> 00:42:07,874
Because if I don't get a minute
without you, I will kill myself.

599
00:42:29,708 --> 00:42:31,624
(WATER SPLASHES)

600
00:42:47,166 --> 00:42:48,540
Hey, what the--

601
00:43:02,458 --> 00:43:06,665
Wait, please, I didn't mean to hurt you.
It was just good luck.

602
00:43:21,458 --> 00:43:23,249
Freeze!
Put your hands up.

603
00:43:24,833 --> 00:43:26,499
Shit!Shit!

604
00:43:26,583 --> 00:43:29,165
You're shaking like a leaf.

605
00:43:29,250 --> 00:43:30,624
Give me the gun.

606
00:43:30,708 --> 00:43:33,207
I'm serious!
You know I'm a terrible shot.

607
00:43:33,291 --> 00:43:36,207
I could easily aim at your head
and blow your balls off.

608
00:43:36,333 --> 00:43:39,124
-You tried to drown me.
-Only a bit.

609
00:43:39,208 --> 00:43:41,374
I'm an ordinary, kind,
peaceful person...

610
00:43:41,458 --> 00:43:42,749
Just calm down.

611
00:43:42,833 --> 00:43:45,915
-Take a deep breath.
-I am calm!

612
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:49,457
Agh!Aah!Aah...

613
00:43:49,541 --> 00:43:52,540
That was an accident!
You frightened me!

614
00:43:56,125 --> 00:43:57,874
Try and find your ear.

615
00:43:57,958 --> 00:44:00,665
Put it on some ice,
and the hospital can stitch it back on.

616
00:44:04,916 --> 00:44:06,582
There's some ice in the mini-bar.

617
00:44:13,375 --> 00:44:14,665
Quick! Run!

618
00:44:14,750 --> 00:44:18,540
What? Shit. Shit!

619
00:44:18,625 --> 00:44:21,540
Didn't even get a bathrobe.

620
00:44:21,625 --> 00:44:25,040
Ah, yes,
Smith, Smith and... Tony.

621
00:44:25,125 --> 00:44:27,290
He tried to kill me!

622
00:44:27,375 --> 00:44:29,415
In the bathroom with a big gun!

623
00:44:31,541 --> 00:44:36,207
Wait!Wait!

624
00:44:36,291 --> 00:44:39,499
My ear!
You sick bastard!

625
00:44:39,583 --> 00:44:41,957
-Put it on ice!
-Move!

626
00:44:43,291 --> 00:44:45,957
-What, you shot his ear o¤
-It was an accident.

627
00:44:50,541 --> 00:44:51,665
Get the case!

628
00:44:51,750 --> 00:44:52,957
Make sure you get them.

629
00:44:53,041 --> 00:44:55,124
You got a professional
on the case now.

630
00:44:59,125 --> 00:45:00,749
Mike!
What are you doing?

631
00:45:00,833 --> 00:45:02,749
The girl,
the moustache,

632
00:45:02,833 --> 00:45:05,499
They were here all the time
in the hotel!

633
00:45:05,583 --> 00:45:07,249
The kid blew my ear off!

634
00:45:09,083 --> 00:45:10,749
The Mini!

635
00:45:10,833 --> 00:45:12,874
Oh, for Christ's sake.
Get the car.

636
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:15,582
Get the car!!

637
00:45:15,666 --> 00:45:18,082
He just frightened me, so I...
(IMITATES GUNSHOT)

638
00:45:18,166 --> 00:45:20,249
-You did what you had to do.
-Did I?

639
00:45:20,333 --> 00:45:22,540
Of course, yeah,
because you're a natural.

640
00:45:29,250 --> 00:45:31,124
-They're following.
-Faster.

641
00:45:31,208 --> 00:45:33,957
-I can't go any faster.
-Drive faster!

642
00:45:34,041 --> 00:45:35,374
I'm doing my best.

643
00:45:35,458 --> 00:45:36,790
I'm still trying
to get the hang ofthe car.

644
00:45:36,875 --> 00:45:38,165
-It's a new car?
-Well, new to me.

645
00:45:38,250 --> 00:45:40,332
Found it at a petrol station yesterday,
keys and everything.

646
00:45:40,416 --> 00:45:42,249
-Talk about luck.
-It's stolen?!

647
00:45:42,333 --> 00:45:44,665
-Yes!
-They're gaining on us.

648
00:45:45,750 --> 00:45:47,957
Right. Here.
Change places.

649
00:45:48,041 --> 00:45:49,832
I'll put my feet on the pedals
and slide under you.

650
00:45:49,916 --> 00:45:51,374
Oh, God. Ooh!

651
00:45:56,083 --> 00:45:58,082
Could you please move!
I can't see a thing!

652
00:45:58,166 --> 00:46:00,665
Well, you seem to be getting
a pretty good feel of everything.

653
00:46:08,250 --> 00:46:10,707
(MUSIC PLAYING)

654
00:46:26,375 --> 00:46:27,582
Ah!Ah!

655
00:46:44,208 --> 00:46:45,540
Oh, my God!

656
00:46:47,208 --> 00:46:49,957
-There's a baby!
-Keep going. We're bigger.

657
00:46:54,125 --> 00:46:55,207
Look out!

658
00:46:55,291 --> 00:46:57,957
(CRASH)

659
00:47:05,333 --> 00:47:07,332
-I think we've lost them.
-Oh, you're not sure?

660
00:47:07,416 --> 00:47:09,415
-D'you want the sitting duck seat?!
-No, I'd rather you did!

661
00:47:09,500 --> 00:47:10,749
Stop bickering!

662
00:47:16,291 --> 00:47:18,457
-Where are we going?
-We need to get out oftown.

663
00:47:18,541 --> 00:47:19,790
No, I like town!

664
00:47:19,875 --> 00:47:23,040
Me too, but I've never tried
anything else, so I'm pretty open.

665
00:47:23,125 --> 00:47:25,082
Look, we're driving
a bullet-strafed stolen car

666
00:47:25,166 --> 00:47:27,165
that's just been involved
in a high-speed chase.

667
00:47:27,250 --> 00:47:29,540
We're being pursued
by hired assassins and, by now,

668
00:47:29,625 --> 00:47:32,165
I imagine every half-witted
police officer in East London.

669
00:47:32,250 --> 00:47:33,582
We're getting out oftown!

670
00:47:35,333 --> 00:47:36,874
Did you bring a tent?

671
00:47:36,958 --> 00:47:39,082
I have a safe place.
We'll go there.

672
00:47:39,166 --> 00:47:40,707
Is it as safe as the hotel?

673
00:47:41,875 --> 00:47:43,499
-I'm ignoring that.
-"I'm ignoring that."

674
00:47:45,083 --> 00:47:46,249
Ow!

675
00:47:53,125 --> 00:47:54,624
-Can we stop?
-No.

676
00:47:54,708 --> 00:47:56,624
-I need to pee.
-We're not stopping.

677
00:47:56,708 --> 00:47:59,040
I pay you 30,000 a week.
You do as I say.

678
00:47:59,125 --> 00:48:01,374
-The next service station.
-I'm paid to protect you.

679
00:48:01,458 --> 00:48:02,915
Mostly, it seems, from yourself.

680
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,082
-30,000 pounds?
-Yeah, exactly!

681
00:48:05,166 --> 00:48:07,499
I should be able to pee sitting down
at that price.

682
00:48:07,583 --> 00:48:10,582
Oh...
(HORN BLARES)

683
00:48:29,916 --> 00:48:34,082
Mr. Smith, 30,000?
That's pretty good money.

684
00:48:34,166 --> 00:48:35,957
Yes, it is.

685
00:48:36,041 --> 00:48:37,999
I mean,
I know it's dangerous.

686
00:48:38,083 --> 00:48:39,999
But I seem to be getting the hang
ofthat side ofthings.

687
00:48:40,083 --> 00:48:42,332
So me being your apprentice,

688
00:48:42,416 --> 00:48:45,207
I thought we could put that
on a more formal footing?

689
00:48:45,291 --> 00:48:47,290
So I could get a cut?

690
00:48:50,333 --> 00:48:53,540
Okay, here's the... thing.

691
00:48:53,625 --> 00:48:58,415
I can offer you six weeks' training,
suspect observation,

692
00:48:58,500 --> 00:49:01,415
fake identities,
a complete range ofweapon skills:

693
00:49:01,500 --> 00:49:04,874
handguns, sniper rifles,
knives, explosives,

694
00:49:04,958 --> 00:49:10,540
the 17 methods of strangulation
and basic untraceable poisons.

695
00:49:10,625 --> 00:49:12,499
You need to know all that
to be a private detective?

696
00:49:12,583 --> 00:49:15,957
You never know who
you might be up against.

697
00:49:17,208 --> 00:49:18,707
Okay. Go on.

698
00:49:18,791 --> 00:49:22,499
Well, I can't offer you health cover
or a pension scheme,

699
00:49:22,583 --> 00:49:24,249
but bed, board and laundry
would be covered

700
00:49:24,333 --> 00:49:27,374
as would a travel card
for the Greater London area.

701
00:49:27,458 --> 00:49:28,832
You'd take care of me?

Don't make me shoot first
and ask questions later.

879
01:02:19,291 --> 01:02:20,624
Start writing.

880
01:02:32,791 --> 01:02:34,624
What flavour are these?

881
01:02:37,291 --> 01:02:38,582
Potpourri.

882
01:02:42,750 --> 01:02:44,082
They're not bad.

883
01:02:49,833 --> 01:02:54,165
Here, but I'm not sure any ofthese
are good enough to have done that.

884
01:02:54,250 --> 01:02:56,582
Marvellous. Fabian?

885
01:02:58,250 --> 01:02:59,415
No. No.

886
01:03:01,625 --> 01:03:03,457
Get the painting.

887
01:03:09,500 --> 01:03:11,124
(SILENCED GUNSHOTS)

888
01:03:17,250 --> 01:03:19,082
It's me.

889
01:03:22,833 --> 01:03:24,082
Am I disturbing you?

890
01:03:24,166 --> 01:03:25,457
No, not at all.

891
01:03:25,541 --> 01:03:27,415
It's late, I know, um...

892
01:03:32,416 --> 01:03:34,999
I'm sorry about before.

893
01:03:35,083 --> 01:03:37,874
I shouldn't have said
all those things.

894
01:03:40,125 --> 01:03:42,790
I was upset and very tired.

895
01:03:45,750 --> 01:03:47,207
Well, there's no harm done.

896
01:03:47,291 --> 01:03:49,124
What do you care what I think,
right?

897
01:03:55,250 --> 01:03:58,124
Well...
you should get some rest.

898
01:03:58,208 --> 01:04:00,957
-I can't sleep.
-What is it this time?

899
01:04:01,041 --> 01:04:02,499
My jaw's hurting.

900
01:04:02,583 --> 01:04:05,207
I have one too many teeth
at the back here.

901
01:04:05,291 --> 01:04:06,707
-Really?
-Yeah.

902
01:04:11,458 --> 01:04:14,249
Do you have any pills?
Temazepam? Trazodone?

903
01:04:14,333 --> 01:04:19,707
Sleeping pills? Soneryl?
Valium? Xanex? Sleepies?

904
01:04:19,791 --> 01:04:21,665
No. I'm sorry, no.

905
01:04:21,750 --> 01:04:24,457
All right,
I'll just go back to my...

906
01:04:26,375 --> 01:04:27,749
Just go back...

907
01:04:27,833 --> 01:04:29,040
I could...

908
01:04:31,625 --> 01:04:33,874
massage your feet.

909
01:04:36,416 --> 01:04:37,999
Are you serious?

910
01:04:38,083 --> 01:04:39,707
A-acupressure.

911
01:04:39,791 --> 01:04:42,207
I trained a long time ago.

912
01:04:43,083 --> 01:04:45,457
I occasionally practice on myself.

913
01:04:45,541 --> 01:04:47,790
It's wonderful for anxiety.

914
01:04:47,875 --> 01:04:49,999
You massage your own feet?

915
01:04:54,583 --> 01:04:56,207
-Here?
-Mm.

916
01:04:57,291 --> 01:04:58,332
And there?

917
01:04:59,625 --> 01:05:02,999
(SIGHS)
You really have a feel for this.

918
01:05:04,916 --> 01:05:09,040
A great many people experience
fits of nocturnal anxiety.

919
01:05:09,125 --> 01:05:12,540
It's perfectly normal.
You mustn't worry about it.

920
01:05:14,083 --> 01:05:17,665
Can I tell you something?
A confession?

921
01:05:17,750 --> 01:05:18,790
Why not?

922
01:05:18,875 --> 01:05:22,582
I like having you protecting me.

923
01:05:22,666 --> 01:05:25,707
You're really good at it.
Well, you seem to be.

924
01:05:28,458 --> 01:05:30,790
I don't really have
anything to compare it with,

925
01:05:30,875 --> 01:05:35,707
because no one--
no one ever tried before.

926
01:05:37,958 --> 01:05:39,082
But with you...

927
01:05:40,750 --> 01:05:42,165
I really enjoy it.

928
01:05:44,791 --> 01:05:47,624
Well...

929
01:05:47,708 --> 01:05:50,415
I enjoy...

930
01:05:50,500 --> 01:05:52,290
doing it.

931
01:05:55,791 --> 01:05:57,957
with me particularly?

932
01:05:59,541 --> 01:06:00,707
With you.

933
01:06:02,958 --> 01:06:04,707
Particularly.

934
01:06:17,500 --> 01:06:19,082
May I...

935
01:06:21,625 --> 01:06:23,040
do the other foot?

936
01:07:00,541 --> 01:07:04,540
(SCREAMS)

937
01:07:04,625 --> 01:07:06,124
Shit.

938
01:07:06,208 --> 01:07:07,499
Tony!

939
01:07:10,166 --> 01:07:14,124
(SCREAMING) Tony!Tony!

940
01:07:14,208 --> 01:07:16,915
Tony!
Let me out, what are you doing?!

941
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:18,874
Tony! Please!

942
01:07:18,958 --> 01:07:21,999
Tony!She's gonna kill me!
Let me out! Please!

943
01:07:30,791 --> 01:07:33,582
This hideous old bat in a wheelchair
just tried to kill me!

944
01:07:33,666 --> 01:07:35,624
She had a knife this big!
I swear!

945
01:07:35,708 --> 01:07:37,499
-It was horrible!
-It's true!

946
01:07:39,625 --> 01:07:41,040
Mother?

947
01:07:41,125 --> 01:07:43,957
Mother, are you there?
It's me.

948
01:07:48,458 --> 01:07:49,499
Mother.

949
01:07:59,708 --> 01:08:01,624
I've got everything under control.

950
01:08:01,750 --> 01:08:04,415
(GUNSHOT)
(WOOD SPLINTERING)

951
01:08:04,541 --> 01:08:06,415
She means well.

952
01:08:07,375 --> 01:08:10,749
Mother, can we talk about this?

953
01:08:10,833 --> 01:08:13,124
I'm very disappointed in you,
Victor.

954
01:08:13,208 --> 01:08:15,499
(SIGHS)
Could you sleep in the living room?

955
01:08:15,583 --> 01:08:17,290
-I'm too frightened.
-Come to my room.

956
01:08:17,375 --> 01:08:19,915
That's an excellent idea.
Tony will look after you.

957
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:22,582
Your reputation is in tatters!

958
01:08:28,250 --> 01:08:29,290
Mother--

959
01:08:29,375 --> 01:08:31,207
Is she, like,
your typical mother?

960
01:08:33,500 --> 01:08:37,082
Until you kill that floozy,
you're the target.

961
01:08:37,166 --> 01:08:39,332
I was behind the door.

962
01:08:39,416 --> 01:08:42,790
Never face a closed door.
How many times have I told you?

963
01:08:42,875 --> 01:08:45,915
-Forgive me, I just--
-No, stop.

964
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:47,915
Do you realize the mess
that you're in?

965
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:51,124
I should have stayed here with you.

966
01:08:51,208 --> 01:08:52,832
Since I moved out,
you've gone to the dogs.

967
01:08:52,916 --> 01:08:55,415
You're not even sleeping with her.

968
01:08:59,208 --> 01:09:02,874
Mother,
I think we have a problem.

969
01:09:02,958 --> 01:09:04,540
Oh, I think so, too.

970
01:09:04,625 --> 01:09:06,874
I know you've invested
a great deal in me--

971
01:09:06,958 --> 01:09:09,832
A Beretta for your seventh birthday.
A Beretta.

972
01:09:09,916 --> 01:09:12,415
The pistol of princes.
No boy could have asked for more.

973
01:09:12,500 --> 01:09:16,540
Indeed.
I just wonder...

974
01:09:16,625 --> 01:09:18,874
a-as a result...

975
01:09:18,958 --> 01:09:20,499
what I've become.

976
01:09:23,625 --> 01:09:25,332
You've become your father's son.

977
01:09:30,250 --> 01:09:31,957
You saved my life.

978
01:09:32,041 --> 01:09:33,207
Again.

979
01:09:33,875 --> 01:09:35,499
I didn't mean to.

980
01:09:35,583 --> 01:09:37,207
I've never been so scared.

981
01:09:38,583 --> 01:09:40,749
I'm glad you did.

982
01:09:40,833 --> 01:09:42,665
Because I got something
to live for now.

983
01:09:49,958 --> 01:09:51,624
I'm in love.

984
01:09:53,125 --> 01:09:54,290
Really?

985
01:09:54,375 --> 01:09:56,665
Oh, yes.

986
01:09:56,750 --> 01:09:58,540
Yes, yes, yes.

987
01:10:04,333 --> 01:10:05,415
Get in.

988
01:10:06,791 --> 01:10:08,040
Go on.

989
01:10:12,583 --> 01:10:13,874
Just lie back.

990
01:10:17,458 --> 01:10:23,624
He's so nice.

991
01:10:23,708 --> 01:10:24,999
Who is?

992
01:10:29,083 --> 01:10:31,249
Mr. Maynard, of course.

993
01:10:31,333 --> 01:10:32,999
-Really?
-Mmm.

994
01:10:35,166 --> 01:10:40,832
You know, when his mother woke me,
I was dreaming about him.

995
01:10:42,250 --> 01:10:44,040
-Really?
-Mm.

996
01:10:46,416 --> 01:10:50,540
It's funny, because yesterday,
I couldn't wait to get away,

997
01:10:50,625 --> 01:10:53,874
and now I never want to leave.

998
01:10:55,583 --> 01:10:57,332
What happened in between?

999
01:10:59,041 --> 01:11:00,165
Just enough.

1000
01:11:02,208 --> 01:11:06,790
No, we'll just stay here together,
just the three of us.

1001
01:11:06,875 --> 01:11:08,790
One big happy family.

1002
01:11:22,791 --> 01:11:25,374
-A difficult night.
-Not at all.

1003
01:11:27,333 --> 01:11:30,249
I owe you an explanation
about my mother.

1004
01:11:30,333 --> 01:11:33,290
-I understand how you feel.
-Do you?

1005
01:11:33,375 --> 01:11:38,582
I had a cousin like your mother.
Mad as a balloon, poor boy.

1006
01:11:38,666 --> 01:11:40,874
And I adored him.

1007
01:11:40,958 --> 01:11:43,082
And family's family, right?

1008
01:11:51,750 --> 01:11:55,124
I don't need your help.
I can easily get a taxi back.

1009
01:11:55,208 --> 01:11:56,790
I got one here, after all.

1010
01:12:43,833 --> 01:12:45,290
Oh, how did you--

1011
01:12:45,375 --> 01:12:49,874
Excuse me, my name's Fabian,
and I would like you to recommend to me

1012
01:12:49,958 --> 01:12:53,540
someone who could paint
something like this.

1013
01:12:56,583 --> 01:12:58,207
Who did this?

1014
01:12:58,291 --> 01:13:00,124
Rembrandt.

1015
01:13:00,208 --> 01:13:01,457
Who?

1016
01:13:03,166 --> 01:13:04,457
Rembrandt.

1017
01:13:04,541 --> 01:13:06,665
Gimme his address. Now.

1018
01:13:08,708 --> 01:13:09,832
He's dead.

1019
01:13:09,916 --> 01:13:12,874
Dead? When?

1020
01:13:12,958 --> 01:13:15,499
Three hundred years ago.

1021
01:13:25,250 --> 01:13:26,374
Gimme a name now.

1022
01:13:26,458 --> 01:13:29,040
Okay, okay, something that good,
it's got to be Gerry.

1023
01:13:29,125 --> 01:13:30,540
-Gerry who?
-Gerry Bailey.

01:31:34,791 --> 01:31:36,332
Did you see that?

1236
01:31:36,416 --> 01:31:38,957
-See what?
-Shit.

1237
01:31:39,041 --> 01:31:40,165
Nobody move!

1238
01:31:40,250 --> 01:31:41,915
Oh, l forgot,
he took that one off me.

1239
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:44,332
Put the guns down.

1240
01:31:45,708 --> 01:31:46,874
Now!

1241
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:49,082
And the knife.

1242
01:31:51,708 --> 01:31:54,249
Really lost your touch,
Maynard.

1243
01:31:54,333 --> 01:31:55,874
That's Felix's gun.

1244
01:31:57,791 --> 01:32:00,374
That was my father's first
and favourite weapon.

1245
01:32:00,458 --> 01:32:03,207
Mm.
Hope that thought softens the blow.

1246
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:06,540
Goodbye.

1247
01:32:06,916 --> 01:32:08,332
(ROSE YELPS)

1248
01:32:12,166 --> 01:32:13,415
Tony...

1249
01:32:13,500 --> 01:32:16,957
Come and see what happens
ifyou don't clean your gun.

1250
01:33:01,583 --> 01:33:02,707
Angel!

1251
01:33:07,583 --> 01:33:08,999
Has anybody seen the cat?
