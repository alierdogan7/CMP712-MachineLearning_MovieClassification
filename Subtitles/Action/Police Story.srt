1
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:24,236
This is Chu Tu.
He's in his mid to late forties.

2
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:29,997
He's a nightclub owner, trader,
and property developer.

3
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:33,436
But we've found out all his companies
are losing money.

4
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:36,671
Hey, how are things up there?

5
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:39,957
This is Mad Wing, his bodyguard.

6
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:44,830
All of his employees
are actually hit men.

7
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:47,753
Be careful!
I'll see you at the dye factory.

8
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:49,512
Wait for me up there.

9
00:01:57,320 --> 00:02:02,474
This is Danny Chu, his nephew.
He's always surrounded by bodyguards.

10
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:05,870
This is John Ko, the brains
behind Chu Tu's organisation.

11
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:12,273
This lady's name is Salina Fong.
She's only joined Chu Tu recently.

12
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:17,115
It’s hard to tell how much she knows
but she is involved.

13
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:25,798
Our mission is to arrest
all these drug dealers.

14
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:29,589
The code name is Operation Boar Hunt.

15
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:32,035
- Have you got that?
- Yes, sir!

16
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:36,033
Read your orders.
You all have specific duties.

17
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:50,477
Memorize then destroy. It's crucial
that you stay in position.

18
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,478
Hurry, come on!

19
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:17,913
Attention! Crime squad!
The Operation is underway!

20
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:14,671
Would you like a cup of tea?

21
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,511
- Two teas please!
- OK!

22
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,399
I'll be back for them.

23
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,436
There is a suspicious looking guy.

24
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:41,356
Two teas please!

25
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:43,635
Tell the others, I'll check it out.

26
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,838
- Kim!
- Are you buying me a tea?

27
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:54,751
- We've been discovered.
- What?!

28
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:56,990
Follow the guy in the red top.

29
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:12,998
- What is it?
- There's a suspicious looking guy...

30
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:14,718
- What are you doing?
- Police!

31
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:17,394
- It's the police!
- The police are here!

32
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,756
Freeze! Police!

33
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,070
I just heard some gunshots.

34
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:39,152
- They've opened fire!
- Let's break up the crowd first.

35
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:40,514
Leave this area now!

36
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:46,035
Crime squad. What's happening?!

37
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,278
Police! Get out of here!

38
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:50,477
Go on! Hurry!

39
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:58,511
Listen! Mind the residents
and get the kids inside.

40
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:02,593
Hurry up! Go on!

41
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:26,272
- Move in and help.
- But we're supposed to stay put.

42
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:29,750
The situation's changed. Move it!

43
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:41,868
- Let me go!
- It gets tighter if you move.

44
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:42,915
Let me go!

45
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:59,309
I'll keep you covered,
you make a break for it.

46
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:20,475
There's a female suspect up there.
Take her back to the station.

47
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:25,439
It's only me!

48
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:32,388
- Why did they open fire?
- Don't ask me.

49
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:38,158
Calm down!

50
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:52,195
Help me!

51
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:55,272
Tak! Cover me!

52
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:20,632
Tak!

53
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:26,675
You must stay calm.

54
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:37,354
Help me.

55
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,431
You stay here and take care of him.

56
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:55,192
They mean business!

57
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,072
Don't forget the warning.
Mind the villagers.

58
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:02,799
But will the bad guys
give a damn about them?

59
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,233
Who made you a cop?

60
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,673
Come here!

61
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:11,992
Be careful, Ka-kui.
These guys are really mean!

62
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:33,119
Boss! This way!

63
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:38,399
Get in!

64
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:43,317
You're blocking the road!
Get out of the way!

65
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:44,958
Reverse!

66
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:50,549
Not this way!

67
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:53,518
- You OK?
- This way's blocked, go back.

68
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:54,999
Go back! Quick!

69
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:59,150
Go back up!
The road below is blocked!

70
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:02,277
- We're stuck, boss! Now what?!
- Go that way!

71
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:03,634
Let's go!

72
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:15,113
Boss! Quick!

73
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:31,233
This way!

74
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:43,915
Freeze!

75
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:48,913
Mind the civilians!

76
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,275
Where have you been?
They've all escaped.

77
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:54,750
- We went up to help.
- Who gave that order? They're gone!

78
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:56,796
You can't blame me for that.

79
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,477
Hurry, go!

80
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:10,914
Can l borrow this?

81
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,037
Tell them to get down.
Don't let them see my face.

82
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:15,792
Tell the driver to step on it!

83
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:24,039
Get down!

84
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:07,755
Turn here, turn!

85
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:17,349
- Keep going!
- Keep going!

86
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:31,311
- Easy, boss, we'll make it.
- Look!

87
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:43,269
Get up there, and get rid of him.
Tell the driver to go faster!

88
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:56,549
Come down here and get him.

89
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:58,312
Come down!

90
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:13,717
Turn the bus! Go down the hill!

91
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:49,310
What are you doing?

92
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:50,753
Police. Stay back!

93
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:57,552
- Boss, the bastard's right in front!
- Run over him!

94
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:59,232
Step on it, run over him.

95
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:06,993
We'll be all right.

96
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:36,515
Freeze!

97
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:41,599
You're under arrest,
but you have the right to...

98
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:44,148
If you let me go...

99
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,070
this is all yours.

100
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:55,918
There is a lot of money here,
no one will ever find out.

101
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:00,754
Smart guy!

102
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:01,829
Stop!

103
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:13,519
Well done, you guys.

104
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:17,878
Give him credit if he praises you
and don't let it go to your heads.

105
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:21,919
l know what to do. Ka-kui is the one
who needs your advice.

106
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:27,152
I didn't do it alone. It was a
success because of careful planning.

107
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:31,711
That's a great line. Don't forget
to say it when the Super comes.

108
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:34,633
He'll be very happy to hear that.

109
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:40,474
Operation Boar Hunt
was carefully planned.

110
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:42,869
You were told to go in
and make the arrest.

111
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:46,191
You almost let the prime suspect
get away.

112
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:47,235
What happened?

113
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:49,231
Didn't he give you clear orders?

114
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:52,392
Yes, but he said the operation
was very well planned.

115
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:53,629
What?!

116
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:58,354
This operation was carefully planned.
But it had a few flaws.

117
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:00,158
Why were there flaws?

118
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:03,073
That's because Ka-kui
couldn't handle the woman.

119
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:06,277
Before we even got to the store,
they heard her screaming.

120
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:09,511
How did Chu Tu get through your men,
then?

121
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:11,238
What do you mean by that?

122
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:14,312
Don't point your fingers
at each other.

123
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:15,958
- What?!
- The PR lady is here.

124
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:17,393
Let her in.

125
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:22,671
The press is here, Superintendent.

126
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:24,716
- Tell them no comment!
- Hold it.

127
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:28,270
- I asked them to come.
- Then, tell them to wait.

128
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:31,871
- Ka-kui, you'll be our spokesman.
- Me?!

129
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:35,919
- I can't possibly.
- The speech is ready, just read it.

130
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,275
Learn your lines
and don't botch them.

131
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:40,351
You can go now.

132
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:50,432
The Chief is well pleased
with Ka-kui's performance.

133
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:52,192
A promising lad.

134
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:55,829
After the speech, take him
to do a police recruitment poster.

135
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:58,559
And arrange for him to appear on TV.

136
00:17:58,640 --> 00:17:59,834
A role model?!

137
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:02,639
The Chief thinks
he's a model policeman.

138
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:05,359
He should be good at it.

139
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:07,510
What are the charges on Salina?

140
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:11,832
Drug dealing, resisting arrest
and assaulting police officers.

141
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:14,673
- Drop all the charges.
- Really?!

142
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:21,757
You played a big part
in this operation.

143
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:26,550
The success ofthis operation
depended on skilful planning.

144
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:27,675
He means you.

145
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:29,478
Will you get a promotion?

146
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:33,591
As a police officer,
I don't fight crime to get promoted.

147
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:36,353
I'm not worried about promotions.

148
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:38,078
Did Chu Tu try to bribe you?

149
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:42,119
He sure did, with millions.
He could have bribed the whole force.

150
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:44,156
Just kidding! Don't put that down.

151
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:46,071
Can you two sit closer?

152
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:50,238
- What are you doing?
- Just saying hello.

153
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:51,594
Don't sit too close.

154
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:54,358
Let me sit here.

155
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:59,513
- He'll come this way, right?
- Yeah!

156
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:00,999
Let's start!

157
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:13,153
Straighten up your back.

158
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:15,037
Open your eyes a bit more.

159
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:17,270
Open your mouth. Wider.

160
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:19,510
Wider still!

161
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:24,789
Forget it, just be yourself!

162
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:26,359
Ready?!

163
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:31,476
The handcuffs in the middle.
Try to be more energetic.

164
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:49,716
- Your plan wouldn't work.
- Why not?

165
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:54,191
Remember, she's Chu Tu's secretary,
Not just anyone can get that job.

166
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:56,714
Chu Tu's been arrested
and once he knows

167
00:19:56,800 --> 00:20:00,395
his secretary is going to be
a witness, what will he do?

168
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:06,033
He'll do everything he can
to stop her appearing in court.

169
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:10,517
Whoever we send to protect her
will be in danger.

170
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:16,552
Don't be a cop if you're not
willing to risk your life.

171
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:20,238
Put that line
on one of our recruitment posters.

172
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:23,039
We don't have enough evidence to
prosecute him.

173
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:27,079
We must push him into a corner.
Then we can put him behind bars.

174
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:29,515
Who's going to protect her?
i suggest...

175
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:32,319
I have someone in mind already.

176
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,356
Great minds think alike.

177
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:41,997
Good luck to him.

178
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:45,428
You're the only one who got bail.

179
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:47,590
You're really lucky.

180
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:53,798
- They're here to see the Super.
- Please wait.

181
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:55,791
- Please wait.
- Right.

182
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:57,950
You can leave after you've seen him.

183
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:06,188
- You can go in now.
- Thanks!

184
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:12,319
Please sit down!

185
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:17,669
You can leave now, Miss Fong.

186
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:19,079
Wait a second.

187
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:23,472
Please keep this subpoena,
you'll need it to appear in court.

188
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:27,636
- What's the charge?
- Nothing!

189
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:30,712
But you'll be acting
as our witness.

190
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:34,433
I'm sorry!
My client isn't going to do that.

191
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:39,275
We're not asking her.
According to law, she has to do it.

192
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,718
- Inspector Chan!
- Yes, sir.

193
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:49,510
Your job is to protect Miss Fong
until she appears in court.

194
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,192
- Me? Protect her?
- Why not?

195
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:53,840
- Great!
- I don't need his protection.

196
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:57,196
As long as he doesn't harass you,
you can't refuse.

197
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:01,319
Inspector Chan.

198
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:03,789
As an escort of the witness,
you must be aware

199
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:07,714
that the witness is often faced with
threat, disturbance, and assault,

200
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:11,679
or irritated
by the intentions of such.

201
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:17,915
lt is your duty to see her safety
and personal rights are intact.

202
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,958
Yes, sir!
But can you send someone else?

203
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:23,918
You'll get expenses
for this assignment -

204
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,479
$2.00 per day.

205
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:28,472
It's an old tradition,
unchanged for years.

206
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:31,190
I know it's very little. That's all.

207
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:34,397
Can we talk to you alone, Miss Fong?

208
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:38,519
My client doesn't answer questions
without the presence of her lawyer.

209
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:40,591
We won't ask her any questions.

210
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:43,558
We just want to advise her
for her own good.

211
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:51,873
- You have the right to refuse this.
- Let me see what they have to say.

212
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:55,396
Mr Cheung! Please excuse us.

213
00:22:57,480 --> 00:23:02,998
You don't have to answer if they ask
you any questions about the case.

214
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:09,871
- Get out of here!
- l have to go, too?

215
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:11,473
What is your rank?

216
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:54,989
What do you want to talk to me about?

217
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:59,875
Nothing, you can go now.

218
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:04,159
See you in court.

219
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:08,238
Did they ask... Let's go.

220
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:10,913
Ka-kui.

221
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:13,392
- Your tape recorder.
- OK.

222
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:16,950
- What did they say to you?
- They didn't say anything.

223
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:22,990
- I’m your lawyer, you can trust me.
- They didn't say a word to me.

224
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:27,914
- Why was it only her...
- They're coming!

225
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:34,150
- How's our boss and the others?
- I can't bail them out.

226
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:38,233
- What about Salina, then?
- She's their witness.

227
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:40,629
- What? Really?!
- They want me to do it.

228
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:42,551
You should have turned it down.

229
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:45,517
Stop bothering our witness!

230
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:49,195
- Who are you?
- I'm a cop!

231
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:51,430
My duty is to protect her.

232
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:55,308
If you keep doing that, l can charge
you with interfering with the police.

233
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:56,549
Salina...

234
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:59,518
You can only say goodbye or bye-bye.

235
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:01,795
One more word
and you're under arrest.

236
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:08,472
- I'll take you home.
- That's part of my job.

237
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:10,198
I’ll tell them nothing!

238
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:17,149
- Now what, Mr Cheung?
- I’ll see your boss this afternoon.

239
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:18,753
All right! Let's go!

240
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:23,073
It’s dangerous for you
to hang around outside.

241
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:26,755
- Let's go home, shall we?
- It’s none of your business.

242
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:30,159
It’s for your own safety.

243
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:33,758
I don't need your protection,
you fool!

244
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:38,749
You know what happened to the last
witness who said that?

245
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:39,909
What happened?!

246
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:44,994
Were they shot? Don't try to
scare me. It won't work.

247
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:47,548
You're right!
They were fine in the end.

248
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:52,191
- You can do whatever you want.
- You can't scare me!

249
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:56,509
All the evidence
points to the defendants.

250
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:58,477
Only your situation is better.

251
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:00,835
We're depending on you, Mr Cheung.

252
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:02,035
I’ll do my best.

253
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:05,556
You'd better be prepared for
bad news. The chances are slim.

254
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:09,269
If i walk away free,
I’ll take good care of you.

255
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:14,590
There's still something
we need to worry about.

256
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:18,468
- Salina is their witness.
- Is she really?!

257
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:20,312
She's been granted bail.

258
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:24,029
The police even gave her an escort -
the guy who arrested you.

259
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:29,917
Salina doesn't know much. She's new.

260
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,638
That doesn't concern me.

261
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:34,996
But she could say something bad
about us in court.

262
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:40,109
l don't think she would... All right.

263
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:46,880
Call Danny for me.
Tell him to take care of Salina.

264
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:55,036
- Thanks a lot!
- Keep the change!

265
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:56,155
See you later!

266
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:05,792
- It’s dangerous to stay home alone.
- l always live dangerously.

267
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:19,917
- John? l just got back.
- The phone is tapped.

268
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:25,952
All right, I’ll meet you later.

269
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:27,714
I'm really scared!

270
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:04,549
You think you can scare me like that?

271
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:10,355
Help!

272
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:19,515
Help!

273
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:21,079
I'm going to kill you!

274
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:32,233
I’ll get you!

275
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:34,675
You have to die!

276
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:41,358
I’m going to kill you!

277
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:44,555
Go to hell!

278
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:47,275
I got you!

279
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:53,796
I’m going to kill you!

280
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:16,314
Don't run away!

281
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:21,593
I've got you now!

282
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:24,032
Go to hell!

283
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:40,358
There's no way out. You're finished.
I’m going to kill you!

284
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:46,919
Don't worry! I’m here!

285
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:54,591
She's terrified. Can l go now?

286
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:57,877
You can leave right now.

287
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:06,916
Hold on to him, I’ll call the police.

288
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:19,118
The phone line!

289
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:23,195
Go now!

290
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:37,351
I knocked him out!

291
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:40,989
Not yet! He's still conscious.

292
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:45,631
He's fighting me! Keep away from us!

293
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:51,668
Please go now.
You can't stay here any longer.

294
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:57,028
He's passed out!

295
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:01,074
No! He's still conscious. See?

296
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:11,517
Please leave here right now!
Go now! Go on!

297
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:17,035
Go! Hurry!

298
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:20,949
Leave him to me!

299
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:28,518
- He's fainted.
- Let me hit him one more time!

300
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:33,474
Stop, or we won't be able
to identify him.

301
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:38,190
- But...
- l don't want to do this any more.

302
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:45,953
I don't know him.

303
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:50,352
- They'd use a stranger to kill you.
- Why kill me?

304
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:54,149
Of course, Chu Tu's a ruthless man.

305
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:58,753
Inspector Chou, it's Ka-kui.
I just realised this is a tough case.

306
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:05,552
Can you send a replacement? No?!
I’m not risking my life for this job.

307
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:10,589
I've had enough of her! l don't
give a damn about her any more.

308
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:14,229
I quit! Enough is enough!

309
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:19,072
- Where are you going?
- Home!

310
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:24,188
- You're supposed to protect me!
- But you're not cooperating.

311
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:31,399
- What if l cooperate?
- It’s too late! l quit.

312
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:41,908
I was right.
You cops have no sense of duty.

313
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:45,834
But there's nothing l can do.
If i stay here, I’ll get killed, too.

314
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:49,113
I’ll cooperate.

315
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,275
I’m not forcing you.

316
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:56,750
I’m doing it of my own free will.

317
00:33:56,840 --> 00:33:59,559
You should come to my house,
it's much safer there.

318
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:02,074
- Great!
- Look at you!

319
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:05,391
- I’ll get changed!
- Chu's men could be back any time.

320
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:08,438
I won't change my clothes, then.
Now what?

321
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:18,719
What is it?!

322
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:21,314
I’m checking
to see if everything's OK.

323
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:27,198
Go back!

324
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:29,839
You can come out.

325
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:39,076
- Why are you holding that?
- This is your jacket.

326
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:40,593
I told you to put it on.

327
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:44,355
Follow me!

328
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:51,833
Use my car.

329
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:54,354
- Which one is yours?
- Over there.

330
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:06,751
- Why are you not nervous at all?
- I’m used to situations like this.

331
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:10,868
- I told you to stay quiet, didn't l?
- Now what?

332
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:14,390
- Are you all right?
- My son!

333
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:18,393
Close the car door!

334
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:02,154
It’s me! Give me my gun!

335
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:10,278
It’s in my jacket pocket.

336
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:18,755
Help!

337
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:28,309
I’ve got you!

338
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:38,993
Freeze!

339
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:42,879
Freeze!

340
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:46,751
Stay calm! Give me the gun.

341
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:48,910
- Stay calm!
- Keep away!

342
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:59,755
Give me the gun! It’s me!

343
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:14,520
- Are you all right?
- Where are they?

344
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:16,556
You scared them off with that shot.

345
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:20,155
We must get you away from here,
those guys are for real.

346
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:23,473
Who was the guy at my house, then?

347
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:27,189
He wanted to kill you, too.
But these are professionals.

348
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:30,113
- l see why you're nervous now.
- Get in the car.

349
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:44,675
- You're crying?!
- How could Chu Tu do this to me?

350
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:49,038
You can't be that naïve,
your boss is capable of anything.

351
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:51,839
He can't have you in that courtroom!

352
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:53,069
What should l do then?

353
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:55,435
You should tell the judge everything

354
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:59,195
so he can put Chu in jail
and then you'll be safe.

355
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:01,794
What should i say to the judge?

356
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:04,471
What rackets Chu Tu's involved in,

357
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:07,870
who his contacts are,
who the dealers are.

358
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:10,354
Why are you taping this?

359
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:14,353
It’s for my own reference.
How long have you worked for him?

360
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:15,759
Four years.

361
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:22,273
He's a family friend. He used to give
my mother money to buy me food.

362
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:27,593
- Now you help him deal drugs.
- I hardly know anything.

363
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:29,875
You can still tell me
what you do know.

364
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:37,430
If you remember anything else,
don't forget to tell me.

365
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:40,318
Do you have enough to prosecute him?

366
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:44,359
That's for the court to decide.
What you've told me is very useful.

367
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:52,555
Come in.

368
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:54,833
Come on.

369
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:58,273
Let me turn on the lights.

370
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:05,713
It’s May.
I almost forgot today's my birthday.

371
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:09,469
Are you all right?

372
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:18,915
Let me introduce you,
this is Miss Fong.

373
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:32,831
- Are you all right?
- I’m fine. May!

374
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:40,075
They've all gone? That was quick!

375
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:41,434
It’s all my fault.

376
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:44,717
She wanted to surprise you,
but you brought me here.

377
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:47,633
And I’m dressed like this.
Of course she's angry.

378
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:52,271
I’m angry, too. l didn't
even have the chance to explain.

379
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:54,316
She dumped the cake on me!

380
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:56,834
I won't answer
if she calls to apologize.

381
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:59,150
I doubt she will.

382
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:03,396
I knew she would be back!

383
00:40:10,120 --> 00:40:11,599
What's happy about it?

384
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:13,671
I saw May. What's wrong?

385
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:17,719
- She saw me with our witness.
- I’ll go and explain to her.

386
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:21,751
No need. Tell her to curb her temper.

387
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:26,790
Why do i have to explain everything
to everyone?

388
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:28,279
I’m sick and tired of it.

389
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:31,591
Do you want some cake?
What about a drink, then?

390
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:34,274
- Orange juice, please!
- Help yourself!

391
00:40:41,720 --> 00:40:42,869
Do you live alone?

392
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:47,476
It’s too big, they'd get me
for corruption. My flatmate's away.

393
00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:51,235
I’m really sorry. Your girlfriend
was furious when she saw me.

394
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:55,313
Don't worry. I was doing my job.
It’s time she understood.

395
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:01,278
Come on! Come in!

396
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:04,638
You'll be all right. I’m leaving.

397
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:05,948
See you!

398
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:13,393
I’m just a cop now.

399
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:17,712
But i might become a movie star
and have to kiss ladies passionately.

400
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:19,074
What would she do then?

401
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:26,910
She loves you, so she's jealous.
I’ll explain to her.

402
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:30,356
What for? She'll never understand me.

403
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:33,477
Aren't you going
to say something nice to her?

404
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:39,192
No way! lf i started sweet-talking,
I'd have a million girls.

405
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:41,840
She must say sorry!

406
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:46,118
You love her a lot, don't you?

407
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:48,668
To be honest, i do love her a lot!

408
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:53,072
But loving her is one thing,
apologizing is another.

409
00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:57,233
When she gets home,
she'll call and apologize to me.

410
00:41:58,360 --> 00:41:59,998
What a waste of food!

411
00:42:10,120 --> 00:42:13,476
Am l right?
She couldn't wait to call me.

412
00:42:17,080 --> 00:42:21,949
- Is that your girlfriend?
- It’s her. She's crying!

413
00:42:23,120 --> 00:42:26,396
Stop crying. You shouldn't
humiliate me in front of people.

414
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:30,314
What?! lf i was with a man,
you'd think i was gay.

415
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:32,914
You're so childish!
Curb your temper!

416
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,309
- Let me explain to her.
- No need!

417
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:37,914
Curb that temper of yours!

418
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:42,118
You should show me some respect.
Stop crying. Talk to you later.

419
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:44,760
It’s time to teach her a good lesson.

420
00:42:55,760 --> 00:43:00,038
- When did she come back?
- Right after you went in the shower.

421
00:43:00,120 --> 00:43:02,680
So she heard everything?

422
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:03,875
The phone call?!

423
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:15,474
Not again! May!

424
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:24,475
Let me explain. She's our witness,
My job is to protect her.

425
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:26,437
I’m mad about what you just said!

426
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:30,672
I was just kidding. Don't be mad.

427
00:43:30,760 --> 00:43:35,117
You just insulted me in front of her.
How dare you?!

428
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:38,749
- Go away!
- Please listen to me! May!

429
00:43:42,120 --> 00:43:46,238
- Are you all right?
- No! Are you happy now?!

430
00:43:46,320 --> 00:43:48,151
I didn't mean to do that!

431
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:52,438
Your shoe. Here, put it on.

432
00:43:52,520 --> 00:43:53,748
Go away!

433
00:43:53,840 --> 00:43:56,274
- Please listen to me!
- No, i don't want to!

434
00:43:57,040 --> 00:43:58,473
Don't be so childish.

435
00:43:58,560 --> 00:44:02,519
- Listen to me, will you?
- Let me go.

436
00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:07,159
Be careful!

437
00:44:09,880 --> 00:44:11,074
I hate you!

438
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:46,359
Where is she?

439
00:44:46,440 --> 00:44:50,149
I accepted her apologies,
and she went home.

440
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:53,550
- Oh, you! That hurt?
- What did l do?

441
00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:56,835
You really poked me!

442
00:44:58,200 --> 00:45:00,998
You're breaking it!
Don't push too hard!

443
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:06,028
What an ugly thing! Go away!

444
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:08,714
It’s the only one l got.
It’s broken.

445
00:45:14,120 --> 00:45:16,873
You got me all wet!

446
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:18,518
Let me wipe it for you.

447
00:45:19,360 --> 00:45:24,434
Please, no more! No, don't!
Not there, here.

448
00:45:24,520 --> 00:45:25,873
- Here?!
- Yeah!

449
00:45:25,960 --> 00:45:29,999
Be gentle! That hurt!

450
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:40,713
This sofa's hard, it's not very
comfy. Let's go to bed now.

451
00:45:42,280 --> 00:45:43,235
Let's go to bed.

452
00:45:43,320 --> 00:45:46,118
- But where can l sleep?
- On my bed.

453
00:45:46,200 --> 00:45:49,317
- And you?
- Next to you.

454
00:45:49,400 --> 00:45:53,313
You're so protective. It’s exciting!

455
00:46:07,560 --> 00:46:10,199
I’m going to bed.

456
00:46:10,280 --> 00:46:11,793
Don't wake me up.

457
00:46:13,480 --> 00:46:16,278
Women are weird!

458
00:46:31,880 --> 00:46:34,838
Ka-kui? Wait! He's on the line.

459
00:46:35,880 --> 00:46:39,793
- You're late. We're waiting for you!
- He's not here.

460
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:44,396
l know it's you. Quick!
Get that witness here.

461
00:46:55,960 --> 00:46:57,473
What was your duty on that day?

462
00:46:57,560 --> 00:47:00,916
I was observing the squatter huts
behind the site.

463
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:04,549
The suspects were trying to escape,
and i arrested two of them.

464
00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:05,675
Thank you!

465
00:47:07,120 --> 00:47:09,031
Can i ask the witness a question?

466
00:47:10,360 --> 00:47:15,115
Inspector Kim, you said
you saw the suspects escaping.

467
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:18,670
Did they pass in front of you
one by one?

468
00:47:18,760 --> 00:47:22,036
Or did you have a special device

469
00:47:22,120 --> 00:47:26,033
to allow you see them escaping
at the same time?

470
00:47:26,120 --> 00:47:31,148
I object! The question
played with the witness's wording.

471
00:47:31,240 --> 00:47:32,275
Overruled!

472
00:47:33,400 --> 00:47:35,152
Thank you! No more questions!

473
00:47:35,960 --> 00:47:38,030
Bring on the next witness.

474
00:47:59,880 --> 00:48:01,950
- That's my spot.
- I’m in a hurry!

475
00:48:03,160 --> 00:48:04,798
I want that space!

476
00:48:06,120 --> 00:48:08,554
Nice parking, though.

477
00:48:18,680 --> 00:48:22,434
What?! She's gone?
What have you been up to?

478
00:48:22,520 --> 00:48:25,080
- Now what? We might lose.
- I don't know.

479
00:48:25,480 --> 00:48:31,430
How could you be so sure that one of
the escaping suspects was my client?

480
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:33,958
He had the same clothes.

481
00:48:34,040 --> 00:48:37,919
In other words, you didn't have a
clear view of the suspects' faces.

482
00:48:38,560 --> 00:48:39,913
l would say so.

483
00:48:41,240 --> 00:48:43,674
- Are you short-sighted?
- No, I’m not.

484
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:45,990
All right. No more questions.

485
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:48,956
Next witness.

486
00:49:03,120 --> 00:49:05,759
I swear to tell the truth.

487
00:49:20,120 --> 00:49:22,839
I was at the squatter huts
for the operation.

488
00:49:22,920 --> 00:49:26,708
The first, second, third
and fourth defendants opened fire.

489
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:28,279
I saw them jump on a bus.

490
00:49:28,360 --> 00:49:30,999
So i took a short cut
and went down the hill.

491
00:49:31,080 --> 00:49:35,232
A citizen helped me
to stop the bus with his car.

492
00:49:35,320 --> 00:49:39,836
After the bus stopped,
I arrested the first defendant.

493
00:49:39,920 --> 00:49:42,798
He tried to bribe me, but l refused.

494
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:43,835
That'll do.

495
00:49:43,920 --> 00:49:46,559
That was very clear. Thank you!

496
00:49:48,360 --> 00:49:51,989
You were at the squatter house.

497
00:49:52,080 --> 00:49:54,196
- What time was that?
- About 6:00am.

498
00:49:54,280 --> 00:49:56,475
- What time exactly?
- 5:55am.

499
00:49:56,560 --> 00:49:57,834
Let's say 6:00am.

500
00:49:57,920 --> 00:50:00,798
In December in Hong Kong,
sunrise is at 6:23am.

501
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:04,634
- Did you know that?
- I didn't know.

502
00:50:04,720 --> 00:50:06,836
- Is that true?
- I don't know.

503
00:50:06,920 --> 00:50:10,310
Do you know the saying
''Darkness before dawn''?

504
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:11,355
No, I don't.

505
00:50:11,440 --> 00:50:16,992
The saying means that it's dark
before the sun rises.

506
00:50:17,080 --> 00:50:19,389
- I might have heard of it.
- All right.

507
00:50:19,480 --> 00:50:21,835
If there wasn't much light,

508
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:25,754
should we believe
you could actually see my client?

509
00:50:25,840 --> 00:50:28,070
Believe what you like.
I did see him.

510
00:50:29,880 --> 00:50:33,350
You said you ran down the hill
to stop the bus.

511
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:38,309
- Was the bus always in sight?
- Yes.

512
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:40,436
- Why hesitate?
- l was thinking.

513
00:50:40,520 --> 00:50:42,033
You have doubts?!

514
00:50:42,760 --> 00:50:46,833
Don't hound him.
Rephrase the question.

515
00:50:46,920 --> 00:50:49,673
How long did it take you
to go down the hill?

516
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:52,399
And was the bus always in sight?

517
00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:55,870
For a while my view
was blocked by the hill.

518
00:50:55,960 --> 00:51:01,273
Could it be that another bus
overtook the first one at that point?

519
00:51:01,360 --> 00:51:03,794
- There was only one bus!
- You're lying!

520
00:51:04,360 --> 00:51:08,592
Sustained!
Defence should rephrase his question.

521
00:51:09,720 --> 00:51:11,870
- Could you be mistaken?
- No!

522
00:51:11,960 --> 00:51:15,873
There are four different bus routes
on that road.

523
00:51:15,960 --> 00:51:19,589
On two routes,
the buses run every five minutes.

524
00:51:19,680 --> 00:51:22,148
The other two,
the buses run every six minutes.

525
00:51:22,240 --> 00:51:25,835
So 88 buses run back and forth
on that road every hour.

526
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:29,754
- That's more than one bus a minute.
- So what?

527
00:51:29,840 --> 00:51:33,230
How long did it take you
to go down the hill?

528
00:51:33,320 --> 00:51:34,753
About two minutes.

529
00:51:34,840 --> 00:51:36,717
- Exactly?
- Two and a half minutes.

530
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:40,190
So at most eight or nine buses
could have passed by.

531
00:51:40,280 --> 00:51:43,158
But you said there was one.
I say you're lying.

532
00:51:43,240 --> 00:51:45,913
Don't you know the buses
are always late?

533
00:51:51,560 --> 00:51:54,632
All right. Let's give you
the benefit of the doubt.

534
00:51:54,720 --> 00:51:59,032
Assume there was one bus
and you could see it all the time.

535
00:51:59,120 --> 00:52:02,317
Which part was clearly visible
to you?

536
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:04,391
- The body.
- How much of the body?

537
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:06,948
- All of it!
- You're lying!

538
00:52:08,600 --> 00:52:09,874
What's he doing?

539
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:14,590
You could see only one side of
this bus. At most, only half of it.

540
00:52:14,680 --> 00:52:17,797
You couldn't see the other half.

541
00:52:17,880 --> 00:52:19,791
- Am l right?
- Yeah.

542
00:52:19,880 --> 00:52:24,795
And anything could have happened
on the side you couldn't see.

543
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:29,237
So if someone jumped off,
you couldn't see him, could you?

544
00:52:29,320 --> 00:52:31,709
- No.
- Speak louder.

545
00:52:31,800 --> 00:52:33,995
I could have jumped off, he couldn't.

546
00:52:34,080 --> 00:52:35,991
Just answer the question.

547
00:52:36,080 --> 00:52:39,516
I mean it!
You try jumping from a moving bus!

548
00:52:39,600 --> 00:52:41,795
Control yourself!

549
00:52:41,880 --> 00:52:44,314
- He tried to bribe me.
- Why would he do that?

550
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:46,960
He offered me money to let him go.

551
00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:51,352
If it was you and someone pointed
a gun at you, what would you do?

552
00:52:52,240 --> 00:52:54,549
Objection overruled! Answer him!

553
00:52:55,360 --> 00:52:59,751
- I'd give him all my money.
- That's what happened to my client.

554
00:52:59,840 --> 00:53:02,991
- Am i right?
- No, I'd already identified myself.

555
00:53:03,080 --> 00:53:06,277
There are many cases where
criminals pose as policemen.

556
00:53:07,960 --> 00:53:09,279
Sustained!

557
00:53:09,360 --> 00:53:13,273
Court will ignore that remark.
Confine your self to this case.

558
00:53:13,360 --> 00:53:14,713
I’m sorry!

559
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:19,510
Consider this, a businessman is
carrying company cash on a bus.

560
00:53:19,600 --> 00:53:23,718
A policeman chasing robbers stops
the bus and points a gun at him.

561
00:53:23,800 --> 00:53:26,598
So the businessman thinks
the policeman is a crook.

562
00:53:26,680 --> 00:53:30,639
So he tells the policeman
to take the cash and let him go.

563
00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:32,995
Inspector Chan, isn't that right?

564
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:38,871
The witness needn't answer.

565
00:53:40,160 --> 00:53:44,551
We already know the answer. He
doesn't need to say it. l conclude.

566
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:49,955
Wonderful!

567
00:53:50,040 --> 00:53:51,712
- Now what?
- I know what to do.

568
00:53:51,800 --> 00:53:53,392
He'll get off the hook.

569
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:01,514
Your Honour, we request
an adjournment.

570
00:54:01,600 --> 00:54:03,113
Our prime witness was delayed.

571
00:54:03,760 --> 00:54:06,149
The Crown has failed
to establish a case.

572
00:54:06,240 --> 00:54:09,152
There is insufficient evidence
to convict my client.

573
00:54:09,240 --> 00:54:11,595
- I request a dismissal.
- Your Honour.

574
00:54:11,680 --> 00:54:14,638
We have taped evidence
from our witness.

575
00:54:14,720 --> 00:54:16,870
Tapes can't be accepted as evidence.

576
00:54:16,960 --> 00:54:18,632
That tape is key to this case.

577
00:54:20,240 --> 00:54:23,915
I will not adjourn
or postpone the hearing.

578
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,468
That would be unfair
to the defendant.

579
00:54:26,560 --> 00:54:30,189
I will grant him bail.
But we will hear that tape first.

580
00:54:30,280 --> 00:54:32,396
This case is not over yet.

581
00:54:42,160 --> 00:54:45,072
Please turn up the volume.
It’s a cheap tape.

582
00:55:08,360 --> 00:55:13,150
Wait! i didn't erase that.
Just let it play!

583
00:55:14,640 --> 00:55:16,039
It’s coming up!

584
00:55:21,160 --> 00:55:22,798
Oh, you! That hurt!

585
00:55:22,880 --> 00:55:26,714
- What did i do?
- You really poked me!

586
00:55:28,240 --> 00:55:32,313
You're breaking it!
Don't push too hard!

587
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:37,394
- What an ugly thing! Go away!
- It’s the only one i got.

588
00:55:37,480 --> 00:55:39,038
It’s only a cactus!

589
00:55:40,560 --> 00:55:42,994
You got me all wet!

590
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:47,831
- Let me wipe it for you.
- Please, no more! No, don't!

591
00:55:47,920 --> 00:55:50,798
That was only orange juice!

592
00:55:51,640 --> 00:55:55,474
That wasn't what you think.

593
00:55:57,760 --> 00:56:02,675
The sofa's hard. It’s not very comfy.
Let's go to bed now.

594
00:56:02,760 --> 00:56:05,877
- Let's go to bed.
- But where can i sleep?

595
00:56:05,960 --> 00:56:07,473
On my bed.

596
00:56:07,560 --> 00:56:10,233
- And you?
- Next to you.

597
00:56:10,320 --> 00:56:12,914
You're so protective. It’s exciting!

598
00:56:15,200 --> 00:56:17,191
Come on!

599
00:56:22,160 --> 00:56:23,673
Please stand back.

600
00:56:25,520 --> 00:56:26,475
No photographs!

601
00:56:26,560 --> 00:56:27,959
Ka-kui!

602
00:56:29,760 --> 00:56:32,718
I want a written report.

603
00:56:34,840 --> 00:56:36,592
Boss!

604
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:38,916
No pictures!

605
00:56:44,960 --> 00:56:48,430
John, reserve a room
at the country club.

606
00:56:48,520 --> 00:56:51,080
We're going to celebrate.

607
00:56:52,240 --> 00:56:55,835
- I’m leaving now.
- Thank you very much!

608
00:57:06,800 --> 00:57:09,758
Next time let's hire him
as prosecutor.

609
00:57:11,840 --> 00:57:14,798
This is Crime Story.
I’m so happy to see you all again.

610
00:57:14,880 --> 00:57:18,839
Our guest today is
a brave police officer.

611
00:57:18,920 --> 00:57:23,516
Sitting next to me is
Inspector Chan Ka-kui.

612
00:57:23,600 --> 00:57:26,194
- Hello!
- Hello! Hello everyone!

613
00:57:26,280 --> 00:57:30,990
After cracking down on the biggest
drug racket in Hong Kong,

614
00:57:31,080 --> 00:57:34,390
you've become very popular
amongst the people.

615
00:57:34,480 --> 00:57:38,439
Would you share this particular
experience with us?

616
00:57:39,960 --> 00:57:44,238
The success of this operation
was due to team work.

617
00:57:44,360 --> 00:57:45,679
I was just a part of it.

618
00:57:45,760 --> 00:57:48,513
We were well prepared for
the operation.

619
00:57:48,920 --> 00:57:53,198
What makes your department so special
in the police force?

620
00:57:53,280 --> 00:57:58,957
To be one of us, you have to be
strong, alert, smart, and...

621
00:57:59,040 --> 00:58:01,679
- Boss.
- What's up?!

622
00:58:01,760 --> 00:58:06,390
His photo is all over
the papers and magazines.

623
00:58:06,480 --> 00:58:10,029
He's even been nominated
for some awards.

624
00:58:16,120 --> 00:58:17,712
''Brave Policeman Arrests Drug Tycoon''

625
00:58:19,080 --> 00:58:22,311
And our Thai source is out of stock.

626
00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:24,470
What? Are they crazy?

627
00:58:24,560 --> 00:58:28,473
They've sold everything to Uncle Joe.

628
00:58:28,560 --> 00:58:29,959
They want hard cash.

629
00:58:31,640 --> 00:58:33,437
Boss, Mr Cheung is here.

630
00:58:33,520 --> 00:58:35,511
Please come in.

631
00:58:36,480 --> 00:58:40,189
Mr Chu, I’ve received your cheque,
thanks a lot!

632
00:58:40,280 --> 00:58:41,918
l should thank you!

633
00:58:42,600 --> 00:58:44,318
How's my case now?

634
00:58:44,400 --> 00:58:49,076
All evidence must remain
with the court until the case ends.

635
00:58:49,160 --> 00:58:50,832
What does that include?

636
00:58:50,920 --> 00:58:55,198
Your passport and bank account.
You can't use them now.

637
00:58:55,280 --> 00:58:59,114
If you're found guilty,
your assets will be confiscated.

638
00:58:59,200 --> 00:59:02,317
And besides,
the bastards could jail me.

639
00:59:02,400 --> 00:59:05,597
- Phone call for you, boss.
- Excuse me!

640
00:59:09,160 --> 00:59:10,115
Salina.

641
00:59:10,200 --> 00:59:12,794
It’s boring here.
I want to go somewhere else.

642
00:59:12,880 --> 00:59:14,199
Not just yet.

643
00:59:14,280 --> 00:59:17,113
- Can i come and see you?
- Not now.

644
00:59:17,200 --> 00:59:21,034
You should stay where you are.
The police are looking for you.

645
00:59:21,120 --> 00:59:23,680
I’m planning a trip to Europe
for you.

646
00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:26,513
Once you're there, you'll be fine.

647
00:59:26,600 --> 00:59:28,318
You just have to wait.

648
00:59:28,400 --> 00:59:30,356
It’s for your own good.

649
00:59:40,680 --> 00:59:45,470
- Where were we?
- We were lucky to bail you out.

650
00:59:45,560 --> 00:59:49,235
It would have been different
If they had found Salina.

651
00:59:49,320 --> 00:59:52,198
I doubt they'll ever
be able to find her.

652
00:59:52,280 --> 00:59:55,636
Very well. I must leave. See you.

653
00:59:58,680 --> 01:00:00,671
Your lawyer is right.

654
01:00:00,760 --> 01:00:04,230
Salina's a big problem.
You can't hide her forever.

655
01:00:05,880 --> 01:00:10,192
Snake Eyes says that stupid cop
is looking for Salina everywhere.

656
01:00:10,280 --> 01:00:14,398
- We should send her abroad.
- On a one-way ticket.

657
01:00:15,680 --> 01:00:19,275
Let's use that stupid cop
to kill Salina.

658
01:00:22,560 --> 01:00:27,873
Be sensible. Chicks like her
aren't difficult to get.

659
01:00:31,240 --> 01:00:32,992
Inspector Man wants to see you.

660
01:00:33,080 --> 01:00:34,354
Let him in.

661
01:00:35,040 --> 01:00:36,792
You paid him off, didn't you?

662
01:00:36,880 --> 01:00:41,317
Yes, I did. But he says he wants
to retire and start a business.

663
01:00:41,400 --> 01:00:43,960
- What does that mean?
- He wants more money!

664
01:00:44,040 --> 01:00:46,156
This way, Inspector Man.

665
01:00:46,240 --> 01:00:48,515
- Hello!
- Hello.

666
01:00:48,600 --> 01:00:50,079
- Sit down.
- I’m OK.

667
01:00:50,160 --> 01:00:53,357
- I came to see you about...
- Yes, I know.

668
01:00:53,440 --> 01:00:56,876
You want to retire
and start a business. Good idea.

669
01:00:56,960 --> 01:01:01,351
- Thanks for your money.
- I know you're a smart guy.

670
01:01:01,440 --> 01:01:04,512
- But i want one more favour.
- What is it?

671
01:01:04,600 --> 01:01:07,956
I want Chan Ka-kui to disappear
for good.

672
01:01:15,160 --> 01:01:19,870
You want to be a hero.
I’ll make you a tragic hero.

673
01:01:48,840 --> 01:01:50,751
I’ll book you for that!

674
01:01:50,840 --> 01:01:52,159
''Superintendent''

675
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:54,991
Hi, there! Follow me.

676
01:01:55,680 --> 01:01:56,908
Inspector Chan!

677
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:59,673
If anything happens,
you can reach me...

678
01:01:59,760 --> 01:02:00,715
..on the pager?

679
01:02:00,800 --> 01:02:03,109
- ..at home.
- But you're on patrol.

680
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:06,992
That doesn't mean
I can't pass by my house.

681
01:02:16,640 --> 01:02:18,039
Excuse me!

682
01:02:18,400 --> 01:02:21,597
I’m going to the toilet,
you stay here.

683
01:02:21,680 --> 01:02:23,716
Don't stay there for too long.

684
01:02:26,640 --> 01:02:27,993
Hello, Police Station.

685
01:02:28,080 --> 01:02:30,071
You called, Inspector Chan?

686
01:02:30,160 --> 01:02:32,594
Of course, any news?

687
01:02:32,680 --> 01:02:37,071
On Salina? l need more time.
It’s not easy, you should know.

688
01:02:37,160 --> 01:02:39,310
Then you won't get paid.

689
01:02:39,400 --> 01:02:42,278
I know. I’m doing my best.

690
01:02:42,360 --> 01:02:45,238
What? Wait a second!

691
01:02:47,680 --> 01:02:49,591
Police Station, hold the line.

692
01:02:51,160 --> 01:02:55,312
- Three more days, Snake Eyes.
- What?

693
01:02:56,880 --> 01:02:58,552
That's not enough time.

694
01:02:58,640 --> 01:03:00,870
What? I’ll give you four days.

695
01:03:00,960 --> 01:03:03,997
Or you'll be in trouble,
when l get back to town.

696
01:03:04,080 --> 01:03:06,150
I’m hanging up now! All right?!

697
01:03:08,920 --> 01:03:11,753
- Can I help?
- I’ve been waiting for ages.

698
01:03:13,800 --> 01:03:16,030
You want to speak to Inspector Chan?
Hold on.

699
01:03:16,120 --> 01:03:19,954
- Phone, Inspector Chan.
- Right, thanks!

700
01:03:22,160 --> 01:03:24,754
- Hello, this is Inspector Chan.
- It’s me.

701
01:03:24,840 --> 01:03:29,231
- Who was that?
- That rude guy?

702
01:03:29,320 --> 01:03:33,313
Didn't i tell you to be polite
on the phone?! You're so rude!

703
01:03:34,160 --> 01:03:35,559
I’m really sorry!

704
01:03:36,320 --> 01:03:38,038
Right. I just told him off.

705
01:03:38,120 --> 01:03:40,793
- How's it going?
- What are you doing now?

706
01:03:40,880 --> 01:03:44,555
Now? Now I’m talking to you.

707
01:03:44,640 --> 01:03:46,949
- Have you had lunch?
- Not yet.

708
01:03:47,040 --> 01:03:48,678
I’m cooking some noodles.

709
01:03:48,760 --> 01:03:51,320
- Have you eaten, then?
- No.

710
01:03:52,800 --> 01:03:54,916
Wait a minute.

711
01:03:56,160 --> 01:03:57,991
Police Station, hold the line.

712
01:03:59,720 --> 01:04:00,675
I’m back.

713
01:04:00,760 --> 01:04:03,433
Mum wants to have dinner with us
on Sunday.

714
01:04:03,520 --> 01:04:06,432
Is that so?
That sounds great. Hold on.

715
01:04:06,520 --> 01:04:08,351
- Police Station.
- My husband...

716
01:04:08,440 --> 01:04:10,749
- Your husband what?
- He's beating me up.

717
01:04:10,840 --> 01:04:14,389
- Who's beating who up?
- My husband's beating me up!

718
01:04:14,480 --> 01:04:18,632
Don't cry. I’ll put you through
to a different department.

719
01:04:18,720 --> 01:04:22,235
I’m coming on Sunday, wait a sec.

720
01:04:22,320 --> 01:04:24,595
The line's busy.

721
01:04:24,680 --> 01:04:26,591
Police Station, how can l help?

722
01:04:26,680 --> 01:04:28,671
- I’m missing a cow.
- Hold the line.

723
01:04:28,760 --> 01:04:33,197
I’ll get you the right department.
The line's still busy.

724
01:04:33,280 --> 01:04:34,918
- Police Station.
- I was raped!

725
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:37,560
Really?!
I have to write down the details.

726
01:04:42,800 --> 01:04:44,313
When were you raped?

727
01:04:44,400 --> 01:04:46,709
I wasn't raped,
but my husband's mad.

728
01:04:46,800 --> 01:04:49,758
Oh! It’s you,
I’m still connecting your call.

729
01:04:49,840 --> 01:04:53,071
- It’s taking so long!
- This is a big police station. Wait!

730
01:04:55,240 --> 01:04:56,468
Who's been raped?

731
01:04:56,560 --> 01:04:58,630
- Me!
- I’m missing a cow!

732
01:04:58,720 --> 01:04:59,994
Hold the line.

733
01:05:00,080 --> 01:05:02,548
- When were you raped?
- Last year!

734
01:05:02,640 --> 01:05:04,517
Why didn't you report it?

735
01:05:04,600 --> 01:05:08,149
- Are there any pills i can take?
- Pills?!

736
01:05:08,240 --> 01:05:09,832
I’ll find out for you.

737
01:05:10,120 --> 01:05:13,157
- Hello, Police Station.
- I’m missing a cow.

738
01:05:13,240 --> 01:05:17,279
All right. But you need to bring in
a photo of the cow first.

739
01:05:21,320 --> 01:05:26,633
May, I’m very busy. She wants me
to name a place for dinner?

740
01:05:26,720 --> 01:05:28,438
Give me a minute first.

741
01:05:30,440 --> 01:05:33,113
- Where shall we go?
- The Family Planning Clinic.

742
01:05:33,200 --> 01:05:36,431
Take a double portion
of contraception pills.

743
01:05:38,680 --> 01:05:41,433
Tell your own mum to take
contraception pills!

744
01:05:41,520 --> 01:05:43,317
What?! May!

745
01:05:44,400 --> 01:05:46,516
I was saying that to someone else.

746
01:05:58,640 --> 01:06:01,154
My mum doesn't need those pills.

747
01:07:12,480 --> 01:07:16,234
- Police Station.
- I’m testing the line, bye!

748
01:07:16,320 --> 01:07:17,435
What?!

749
01:07:30,560 --> 01:07:34,269
- Stuck in traffic?
- No, not traffic.

750
01:07:34,360 --> 01:07:35,679
You're late.

751
01:07:35,760 --> 01:07:38,877
lfthe roads were congested,
l wouldn't be here at all.

752
01:07:38,960 --> 01:07:42,714
You're having dinner with us.
Mum hates it when anyone's late!

753
01:07:42,800 --> 01:07:46,270
I’ve been waiting all day
for Snake Eyes to phone.

754
01:07:46,360 --> 01:07:48,920
You're offthat case.
Forget about it.

755
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:50,115
I can't.

756
01:07:52,400 --> 01:07:53,958
I need to make a phone call.

757
01:07:54,920 --> 01:07:56,797
Hold on to the car.

758
01:07:56,880 --> 01:07:59,952
The hand brake doesn't work.
Don't let go.

759
01:08:10,880 --> 01:08:12,836
It’s me, Snake Eyes.

760
01:08:12,920 --> 01:08:17,357
Chu Tu's hiding that witness you're
looking for in his Kowloon villa.

761
01:08:17,440 --> 01:08:20,000
You sure?

762
01:08:20,080 --> 01:08:23,789
Better hurry.
They don't plan to keep her alive.

763
01:08:23,880 --> 01:08:25,074
Is it true?

764
01:08:25,160 --> 01:08:27,958
Would i lie to you? Hurry up!

765
01:08:32,400 --> 01:08:33,389
Are you coming?!

766
01:08:33,480 --> 01:08:37,155
That was Snake Eyes.
I know where they're hiding Salina.

767
01:08:37,720 --> 01:08:38,755
Don't go!

768
01:08:38,840 --> 01:08:42,071
If Chu Tu kills her, he'll go free.

769
01:08:42,160 --> 01:08:44,674
I’ve got to save her.
I can't let her die.

770
01:08:44,760 --> 01:08:46,671
- What's up?
- Your car!

771
01:08:54,160 --> 01:08:56,549
- What now?!
- Taxi!

772
01:08:57,480 --> 01:09:01,758
Call someone to tow the car away.
And say sorry to your mum for me.

773
01:09:03,040 --> 01:09:04,917
Be careful!

774
01:09:11,880 --> 01:09:13,757
- Keep the change.
- Thanks!

775
01:10:22,440 --> 01:10:25,910
- What happened?
- I don't know what they're up to.

776
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:29,788
- Is anyone else here?
- No one. They just disappeared.

777
01:10:29,880 --> 01:10:32,075
Now you know what Chu Tu is like.

778
01:10:32,160 --> 01:10:35,948
If you had listened to me,
you wouldn't be in danger.

779
01:10:36,720 --> 01:10:41,316
It’s lucky l got here.
Otherwise, you'd be dead.

780
01:10:45,880 --> 01:10:47,791
Let's get out of here.

781
01:10:49,880 --> 01:10:51,393
Stop!

782
01:11:36,480 --> 01:11:37,833
Freeze!

783
01:11:44,320 --> 01:11:45,639
Step aside.

784
01:11:48,640 --> 01:11:52,872
- How did you know l was here?
- I have my ways.

785
01:12:00,600 --> 01:12:04,070
- You can't be...
- Surprised?!

786
01:12:05,360 --> 01:12:07,749
That's not the only surprise.

787
01:12:07,840 --> 01:12:09,796
We were supposed to kill him.

788
01:12:11,720 --> 01:12:13,597
That's right.

789
01:12:13,680 --> 01:12:18,151
The boss wants us to use
a police gun. One cop kills another.

790
01:12:18,240 --> 01:12:20,196
What a perfect set-up!

791
01:12:21,520 --> 01:12:23,158
Who's killing who?

792
01:12:34,840 --> 01:12:36,478
Let's get out of here!

793
01:12:49,920 --> 01:12:50,989
No!

794
01:12:51,080 --> 01:12:52,354
I can't do it!

795
01:12:53,800 --> 01:12:55,313
No!

796
01:12:57,560 --> 01:12:58,709
Jump!

797
01:13:04,960 --> 01:13:06,279
Move it!

798
01:13:11,560 --> 01:13:13,073
Stop!

799
01:13:16,760 --> 01:13:18,079
Go get her!

800
01:13:19,080 --> 01:13:20,354
You little prick!

801
01:13:21,280 --> 01:13:25,239
We'll teach you.
You'll wish you'd never interfered.

802
01:13:31,480 --> 01:13:32,799
That's enough!

803
01:13:34,680 --> 01:13:36,318
Take care of him. I’ll go down.

804
01:13:37,520 --> 01:13:40,080
Ka-kui didn't shoot Inspector Man.

805
01:13:40,160 --> 01:13:44,551
We can't take your word for it.
Where did he go with his gun?

806
01:13:44,640 --> 01:13:48,633
The bullet that killed Man was fired
from Ka-kui's gun.

807
01:13:48,720 --> 01:13:52,998
Policemen make lots of enemies.
Someone is trying to frame Ka-kui.

808
01:13:53,080 --> 01:13:56,436
lf it were anyone else but Ka-kui,
would you feel the same?

809
01:13:56,520 --> 01:13:58,033
You're our boss.

810
01:13:58,120 --> 01:14:02,113
Don't always go by the book!
Show some feelings for your men.

811
01:14:02,200 --> 01:14:07,069
I don't want people thinking
if a cop kills, he gets away with it.

812
01:14:07,160 --> 01:14:09,674
There'll be no cover up!
One law for all.

813
01:14:09,760 --> 01:14:12,797
You want to nail him
even more than the crooks!

814
01:14:12,880 --> 01:14:14,393
Enough!

815
01:14:15,880 --> 01:14:19,475
If you were me, what would you do?

816
01:14:53,560 --> 01:14:55,676
Hi, May.

817
01:15:00,720 --> 01:15:01,914
I know.

818
01:15:05,080 --> 01:15:07,958
I’ll wait for you.

819
01:15:12,320 --> 01:15:13,833
''One Cop Kills Another''

820
01:15:13,920 --> 01:15:15,433
''Policeman Is Killed''

821
01:15:17,440 --> 01:15:19,112
What should we do?

822
01:15:22,360 --> 01:15:24,476
My mum is really worried about you.

823
01:15:36,280 --> 01:15:39,909
Ka-kui, be careful!

824
01:15:54,520 --> 01:15:56,192
Ka-kui's back!

825
01:16:07,200 --> 01:16:09,919
- Ka-kui!
- Ka-kui!

826
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:15,592
Ka-kui!

827
01:16:16,800 --> 01:16:19,394
- I didn't kill him.
- We believe you.

828
01:16:19,480 --> 01:16:21,675
But where have you been?

829
01:16:23,040 --> 01:16:24,712
I don't know.

830
01:16:24,800 --> 01:16:29,237
You must remember something. Were
you drunk or with your girlfriend?

831
01:16:30,800 --> 01:16:32,631
I was fighting Chu Tu's men.

832
01:16:32,720 --> 01:16:35,518
Inspector Man appeared
and pointed his gun at me.

833
01:16:35,600 --> 01:16:38,831
They took my revolver
and shot Man with it.

834
01:16:38,920 --> 01:16:41,115
That's all i remember.

835
01:16:41,200 --> 01:16:42,189
Nothing else?

836
01:16:42,280 --> 01:16:47,035
You disliked Man,
and the bullet was from your gun.

837
01:16:47,120 --> 01:16:51,079
I wouldn't kill him over
some petty differences.

838
01:16:51,160 --> 01:16:53,594
Who would believe that?
We must have proof!

839
01:16:53,680 --> 01:16:55,398
That's how the law works.

840
01:16:57,120 --> 01:17:00,271
- But I’m glad you're back.
- Give me your gun.

841
01:17:02,200 --> 01:17:06,751
Call Homicide.
Tell them we have the suspect.

842
01:17:08,880 --> 01:17:13,476
Ka-kui, don't worry.
We'll do our very best to help you.

843
01:17:14,840 --> 01:17:15,795
Lock him up.

844
01:17:16,800 --> 01:17:19,758
And charge him...with murder.

845
01:17:23,040 --> 01:17:24,917
How could you?!

846
01:17:27,360 --> 01:17:28,873
Freeze!

847
01:17:28,960 --> 01:17:32,475
- Ka-kui, what are you doing?
- I didn't kill anyone!

848
01:17:33,800 --> 01:17:36,792
- Don't you believe me?
- I believe you.

849
01:17:36,880 --> 01:17:39,633
But based on the evidence,
I must charge you.

850
01:17:39,720 --> 01:17:43,872
Can't you see i was framed?
You're bloody stupid!

851
01:17:43,960 --> 01:17:46,679
I’ll conduct
a very thorough investigation!

852
01:17:46,760 --> 01:17:49,274
- Don't give me that!
- Let him go!

853
01:17:51,720 --> 01:17:52,709
Fine!

854
01:17:52,800 --> 01:17:56,759
- What you are doing is dangerous!
- Dangerous for him!

855
01:17:56,840 --> 01:18:00,913
While we risk our lives out there,
he's sitting back thinking of chicks.

856
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:04,595
We've arrested so many bad guys,
but he's never satisfied.

857
01:18:04,680 --> 01:18:07,717
And that stupid idea of protecting
the witness.

858
01:18:07,800 --> 01:18:09,074
So easy?!

859
01:18:09,160 --> 01:18:12,550
You only have to open your mouth
and we have to risk our lives!

860
01:18:12,640 --> 01:18:14,073
- Ka-kui!
- Shut up!

861
01:18:14,160 --> 01:18:19,188
You got promoted at our expense.
Have you ever thought of us?

862
01:18:19,280 --> 01:18:22,352
If any of us dies,
you need only write a report

863
01:18:22,440 --> 01:18:24,192
and turn up for the funeral.

864
01:18:24,280 --> 01:18:26,840
We have families, too.

865
01:18:26,920 --> 01:18:31,038
lf it wasn't for us, you'd never have
this office and all this other crap!

866
01:18:31,120 --> 01:18:32,155
Get back!

867
01:18:33,680 --> 01:18:36,592
Come any closer
and I’ll blow his head off!

868
01:18:36,680 --> 01:18:38,033
Ka-kui, don't do that!

869
01:18:38,480 --> 01:18:40,311
Open the door!

870
01:18:41,120 --> 01:18:42,075
Don't move!

871
01:18:43,040 --> 01:18:44,473
Don't push me!

872
01:18:44,800 --> 01:18:46,074
Keep back!

873
01:18:46,160 --> 01:18:50,312
Don't worry about me.
I know what I’m doing!

874
01:18:53,880 --> 01:18:56,633
Ka-kui's holding the Super hostage!

875
01:18:59,440 --> 01:19:00,395
Calm down!

876
01:19:01,400 --> 01:19:03,595
Stay cool! Ka-kui, calm down.

877
01:19:04,520 --> 01:19:05,555
Stay back!

878
01:19:08,600 --> 01:19:11,956
- Ka-kui, calm down.
- Let's talk about this.

879
01:19:12,040 --> 01:19:13,632
We'll sort this out.

880
01:19:13,720 --> 01:19:16,154
Put your hands on the table.

881
01:19:16,240 --> 01:19:17,753
Now!

882
01:19:19,160 --> 01:19:20,479
You're being stupid.

883
01:19:20,560 --> 01:19:24,394
Give up before it's too late!
We'll help you.

884
01:19:24,480 --> 01:19:27,040
Trust us! We'll sort this out.

885
01:19:27,120 --> 01:19:29,793
I trust all of you,
but i can't depend on you.

886
01:19:29,880 --> 01:19:32,235
- You're making it worse!
- Stop!

887
01:19:32,320 --> 01:19:33,435
Don't move!

888
01:19:37,600 --> 01:19:39,192
Don't push him!

889
01:19:41,320 --> 01:19:45,996
Don't push him.
Call in the snipers. Alert all units.

890
01:20:04,680 --> 01:20:06,477
Easy, everybody!

891
01:20:10,320 --> 01:20:11,799
Ka-kui!

892
01:20:19,520 --> 01:20:21,511
Get in!

893
01:20:22,840 --> 01:20:24,876
- Ka-kui!
- Drive out.

894
01:20:29,640 --> 01:20:31,153
Let them go!

895
01:20:32,760 --> 01:20:33,988
Don't go after them!

896
01:20:38,600 --> 01:20:39,919
Where are we going?

897
01:20:43,880 --> 01:20:45,393
Stop.

898
01:20:47,840 --> 01:20:49,432
Get out.

899
01:20:56,040 --> 01:20:58,793
I wouldn't have shot
even if you had run.

900
01:20:58,880 --> 01:21:00,677
I know.

901
01:21:00,760 --> 01:21:04,594
I’m not sure how to help you,
but you'll have a head start.

902
01:21:04,680 --> 01:21:07,069
They'll start hunting for you
once l get back.

903
01:21:08,760 --> 01:21:12,036
I’ll get Chu Tu
before your men get me.

904
01:21:13,040 --> 01:21:18,592
- I hope so.
- Thank you, sir.

905
01:21:23,440 --> 01:21:26,034
No one knows where this Salina is.

906
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:30,675
Let's get a couple of chicks
and have some fun.

907
01:21:45,480 --> 01:21:51,157
I didn't set you up, Inspector Chan!
lt wasn't me. I had no part in it!

908
01:21:55,160 --> 01:21:56,434
It’s for you.

909
01:21:58,720 --> 01:22:02,395
I’ll have it then. I’m starving.

910
01:22:57,080 --> 01:22:59,913
Boss, I heard that stupid cop
is on the run.

911
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:01,592
Wasn't he arrested?

912
01:23:01,680 --> 01:23:05,673
- He's run away!
- He's got some nerve!

913
01:23:05,760 --> 01:23:09,514
We should have killed him, too,
once and for all.

914
01:23:10,200 --> 01:23:11,315
Where is Salina?

915
01:23:11,400 --> 01:23:13,709
Mad Wing and Snake Eyes
are looking for her.

916
01:23:13,800 --> 01:23:15,358
We've heard nothing from them.

917
01:23:15,440 --> 01:23:18,238
Salina could be with that stupid cop.

918
01:23:25,240 --> 01:23:26,195
What's up, boss?

919
01:23:31,760 --> 01:23:33,637
Someone's stealing my data.

920
01:23:33,720 --> 01:23:36,792
- Who is it?
- It must be Salina.

921
01:23:36,880 --> 01:23:39,110
Only she knows the password.

922
01:23:39,200 --> 01:23:40,952
- Go get her.
- Alert our men.

923
01:23:41,040 --> 01:23:42,029
Call Mr Cheung.

924
01:23:56,840 --> 01:24:00,230
- How long do we need to wait?
- You're impatient.

925
01:24:00,320 --> 01:24:03,869
I’m not, but I’m scared.

926
01:24:15,280 --> 01:24:16,952
You two stay here.

927
01:24:29,640 --> 01:24:30,868
Up there.

928
01:24:34,960 --> 01:24:36,678
Call Inspector Chou!

929
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:41,673
Get that briefcase
or we're doomed! Quick!

930
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:19,989
That way!

931
01:25:24,120 --> 01:25:27,271
- Ka-kui!
- Why didn't you go to the police?

932
01:25:27,360 --> 01:25:29,237
Chu Tu's men are here.

933
01:25:29,320 --> 01:25:32,869
- You witnessed Man's murder.
- I’ve got evidence on Chu Tu.

934
01:25:51,480 --> 01:25:53,232
They're here!

935
01:26:14,880 --> 01:26:17,075
Take her back to the office. Quick!

936
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:22,353
What's going on?

937
01:26:30,720 --> 01:26:31,948
Let's go.

938
01:28:52,920 --> 01:28:54,273
- Come on!
- I’m not going.

939
01:28:59,280 --> 01:29:00,508
Kill him!

940
01:30:13,200 --> 01:30:14,872
Catch!

941
01:30:16,160 --> 01:30:17,832
It’s there! Go and get it!

942
01:30:21,760 --> 01:30:23,478
- May!
- Are you all right, Ka-kui?

943
01:30:23,560 --> 01:30:26,120
Don't worry about me.
Get the briefcase!

944
01:30:33,760 --> 01:30:34,715
Go to hell!

945
01:30:38,920 --> 01:30:40,638
Chu Tu!

946
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:46,955
Quick!

947
01:30:54,880 --> 01:30:56,438
Hurry!

948
01:31:22,480 --> 01:31:24,869
- Ka-kui, stop!
- Don't do it!

949
01:31:29,200 --> 01:31:31,873
- Put that down.
- We'll sort this out!

950
01:31:31,960 --> 01:31:35,270
- This is between him and me.
- He's not worth it.

951
01:31:35,360 --> 01:31:38,909
There's no justice. l have to take
the law into my own hands.

952
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:43,596
- Don't do anything foolish.
- I’m going to kill him right here.

953
01:31:43,680 --> 01:31:46,319
It was Danny Chu
who killed Inspector Man.

954
01:31:46,400 --> 01:31:49,949
All the evidence
is in the briefcase.

955
01:31:53,840 --> 01:31:54,955
Are you all right?

956
01:31:55,040 --> 01:31:58,749
May is hurt, Ka-kui.
Take care of her first!

957
01:32:04,880 --> 01:32:07,553
Take all the suspects
back to the station!

958
01:32:07,640 --> 01:32:10,473
You're abusing your power
as police officers.

959
01:32:10,560 --> 01:32:12,278
You're hurting innocent people.

960
01:32:13,520 --> 01:32:16,717
You're not above the law.
Justice is for everyone.

961
01:32:16,800 --> 01:32:23,558
I’m going to sue you for kidnapping,
threatening and assaulting my client.

962
01:32:23,640 --> 01:32:26,552
I’m not going to let you
get away with this!

963
01:32:26,640 --> 01:32:28,437
You lot are a menace to society!

964
01:32:31,160 --> 01:32:33,515
- He just proved it.
- Ka-kui, let go of him.

965
01:32:33,600 --> 01:32:36,114
- This is entrapment!
- You're going to jail.

966
01:32:36,200 --> 01:32:38,509
How dare you treat a lawyer
like that?

967
01:32:38,600 --> 01:32:40,989
We're so glad you're here, Mr Cheung!

968
01:33:00,960 --> 01:33:03,190
You'll have to help me
with that report.

969
01:33:03,280 --> 01:33:05,874
- Pardon?
- Let's write it together.

970
01:33:05,960 --> 01:33:08,110
I didn't see anything.

971
01:33:19,400 --> 01:33:20,628
That's enough!
