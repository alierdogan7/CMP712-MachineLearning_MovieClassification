You don't have to wear it all the time,
but we got some rapids comin' up here.

You all right?

168

[Gail]
If you're gonna sit there in the back...

169
00:12:54,021 --> 00:12:56,956
you should sit on
the floor in the center.

170
00:12:57,024 --> 00:13:00,187
- I can't see from there.
- Well, then, sit in front.

171
00:13:00,261 --> 00:13:02,229
I like it here.

172
00:13:02,296 --> 00:13:04,696
Okay.

173
00:13:06,233 --> 00:13:08,701
[Roarke]
Here we go!

174
00:13:08,769 --> 00:13:10,896
Woo-hoo! Heh!
[Laughing]

175
00:13:10,972 --> 00:13:13,998
Wow, this is great!
[Shouting]

176
00:13:17,445 --> 00:13:20,414
[Roarke]
Yes! Hold on, Maggie!

177
00:13:22,683 --> 00:13:27,711
[Roarke Whooping]
Look out for that rock!

178
00:13:34,762 --> 00:13:36,696
Ohh!

179
00:13:36,764 --> 00:13:39,392
- [Laughing]
- Whoa!

180
00:13:40,634 --> 00:13:44,434
That was great!
But where's Dad?

181
00:13:44,505 --> 00:13:46,939
[Laughing]
He's swimming.

182
00:13:49,276 --> 00:13:52,541
- [Gail] Point your feet down!
- Point your toes, Dad!

183
00:13:52,613 --> 00:13:56,674
Could you just stop laughing
for a second and help me into the boat?

184
00:13:56,751 --> 00:13:58,981
- [Laughing Stops]
- [Moaning]

185
00:13:59,053 --> 00:14:00,953
- Ohh!
- Oh!

186
00:14:01,022 --> 00:14:03,217
[Moaning]

187
00:14:03,290 --> 00:14:06,282
Is this the biggest one, Mom?

188
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:08,294
The biggest one's
the Gauntlet.

189
00:14:08,362 --> 00:14:10,296
That's a five-plus.

190
00:14:10,364 --> 00:14:12,798
That's off the scale.

191
00:14:12,867 --> 00:14:16,598
- When do we do that one?
- Well, we don't do that one.

192
00:14:16,670 --> 00:14:19,639
That's after the take-out
at Bridal Creek.

193
00:14:19,707 --> 00:14:22,904
- You can't go down there.
- Have you ever done it?

194
00:14:22,977 --> 00:14:26,435
- Mom is saying it's too dangerous.
- For you, maybe.

195
00:14:26,514 --> 00:14:29,449
Roarke. Honey,
I went down the Gauntlet...

196
00:14:29,517 --> 00:14:33,283
when I was 18 years old
with two other guides...

197
00:14:33,354 --> 00:14:35,288
experienced guides.

198
00:14:35,356 --> 00:14:37,950
And we were just lucky.

199
00:14:38,025 --> 00:14:41,961
But there were two other people
that summer who did not get so lucky.

200
00:14:42,029 --> 00:14:46,523
One guy got killed,
and the other one is paralyzed for life.

201
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:51,196
Don't worry. We're gonna hit
some threes and some four-pluses...

202
00:14:51,272 --> 00:14:55,174
and we will risk death
a number of times on this trip.

203
00:14:55,242 --> 00:14:58,575
So you're gonna scream,
you're gonna be so happy.

204
00:15:00,314 --> 00:15:03,977
- Hey, look, Mom, there's Wade!
- [Gail] Hello, the shore!

205
00:15:04,051 --> 00:15:07,214
- [Wade] Hello, the boat!
- Is everybody okay?

206
00:15:07,288 --> 00:15:10,451
- Yeah, I just got a cramp!
- We're trying to work it out.

207
00:15:10,524 --> 00:15:13,152
Hey, who's your friend, Gail?

208
00:15:13,227 --> 00:15:17,186
Oh, this is Tom,
uh, Roarke's father.

209
00:15:17,264 --> 00:15:21,132
Oh, no. You didn't tell him
about us, did you?

210
00:15:21,202 --> 00:15:23,227
[Laughing] No.

211
00:15:23,304 --> 00:15:27,741
Hey, Roarke!
Don't tell those fish we're comin'!

212
00:15:29,977 --> 00:15:33,913
[Gail] All right,
let's bring a little line in, okay?

213
00:15:33,981 --> 00:15:37,075
We're gonna aim for that ripple
right over there. See?

214
00:15:37,151 --> 00:15:39,210
Ten, two, ten, two...

215
00:15:39,286 --> 00:15:41,220
ten, release!

216
00:15:41,288 --> 00:15:42,915
Then let go of your line.

217
00:15:42,990 --> 00:15:46,926
Why don't you ask your dad
if he wants to come over?

218
00:15:46,994 --> 00:15:50,327
Hey, Dad, you wanna try this?

219
00:15:50,397 --> 00:15:52,524
Not now!
Thanks, buddy!

220
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:56,263
[Roarke] Do you think
he even knows he left Boston?

221
00:15:56,337 --> 00:15:58,771
Yeah, he knows.

222
00:15:58,839 --> 00:16:03,674
But he took two planes
and a charter just to get here, so...

223
00:16:03,744 --> 00:16:05,678
let's give him a break.

224
00:16:05,746 --> 00:16:09,842
- Try it again.
- Why are you suddenly on his side?

225
00:16:09,917 --> 00:16:12,852
I'm on everybody's side.
I'm the mother.

226
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:15,388
- [Gasps] You got it! That's it!
- Look, Mom!

227
00:16:15,456 --> 00:16:18,914
You got a nice one, buddy.
He's a beauty.

228
00:16:18,993 --> 00:16:20,927
Let's get him.
There he is.

229
00:16:20,995 --> 00:16:22,929
Come here.
Come here, sweetheart.

230
00:16:22,997 --> 00:16:26,899
Look, Daddy.
Oh, it's a monster.

231
00:16:26,967 --> 00:16:29,435
You know,
this is the first time...

232
00:16:29,503 --> 00:16:33,098
we've all had dinner together
since Mom's birthday.

233
00:16:36,777 --> 00:16:40,543
Hello, the Gail, Roarke
and Tom family!

234
00:16:40,614 --> 00:16:43,139
This is the Wade raft
passing you by!

235
00:16:43,217 --> 00:16:46,414
Hey, Wade!
I caught two fish today!

236
00:16:46,487 --> 00:16:48,682
First time I ever fished!

237
00:16:48,756 --> 00:16:50,781
Must be that lucky hat!

238
00:16:50,858 --> 00:16:56,694
Hey, Roarke, if that hat's so lucky,
I want it back!

239
00:17:12,379 --> 00:17:15,177
Hi.

240
00:17:15,249 --> 00:17:18,343
- He's down.
- Mm-hmm.

241
00:17:18,419 --> 00:17:21,445
- [Sighs]
- Well, had a big day.

242
00:17:25,526 --> 00:17:28,290
It's kind of warm.

243
00:17:30,331 --> 00:17:32,356
That's the way I like it.

244
00:17:39,273 --> 00:17:43,073
Did you finish
your sketches yet?

245
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:48,275
No. No, I didn't.

246
00:17:48,349 --> 00:17:50,647
And it's not a sketch, Gail.

247
00:17:50,718 --> 00:17:54,176
- You know, it's very important.
- Very important, I know.

248
00:17:54,255 --> 00:17:56,189
- So, tomorrow...
- What?

249
00:17:56,257 --> 00:18:00,057
Could you just pretend
to like it here a little bit?

250
00:18:00,127 --> 00:18:02,561
For Roarke's sake,
if not for mine.

251
00:18:02,630 --> 00:18:07,567
I don't do too bad at pretending
to like your stuff, so...

252
00:18:10,638 --> 00:18:14,233
Is that what you do?
Pretend to like my stuff?

253
00:18:14,308 --> 00:18:18,244
- No. You know, that's not what I mean.
- You don't have to.

254
00:18:18,312 --> 00:18:22,510
And just don't.
And don't do me any favors, either.

255
00:18:22,583 --> 00:18:25,381
I don't.

256
00:18:27,354 --> 00:18:29,288
I won't.

257
00:18:34,028 --> 00:18:35,962
Gail.

258
00:18:36,030 --> 00:18:40,057
- Listen, don't you ever realize...
- Let's just stop, okay?

259
00:18:40,134 --> 00:18:42,364
You never...
Oh, please!

260
00:18:45,005 --> 00:18:47,098
[Gail Laughing]

261
00:18:47,174 --> 00:18:49,734
[Screaming]

262
00:18:49,810 --> 00:18:53,473
- [Laughing]
- [Roarke] Whoa, it's cold!

263
00:18:53,547 --> 00:18:55,447
Whoo!

264
00:18:55,516 --> 00:18:57,541
[Maggie Barking]

265
00:19:01,989 --> 00:19:05,083
[Roarke Whooping]

266
00:19:05,159 --> 00:19:07,650
Wow!

267
00:19:08,729 --> 00:19:12,495
Hey, look, Mom!
Graffiti!

268
00:19:12,566 --> 00:19:14,796
Oh, wow!

269
00:19:14,868 --> 00:19:18,269
Those are pictographs.
They were made by people...

270
00:19:18,339 --> 00:19:21,467
who lived here thousands of years
before white men came.

271
00:19:21,542 --> 00:19:23,567
So those are their hands?

272
00:19:23,644 --> 00:19:26,374
Those markings might've been
made by a boy your age...

273
00:19:26,447 --> 00:19:28,938
while he was
on his vision quest.

274
00:19:29,016 --> 00:19:31,746
See?

275
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:36,356
Are you sure there's
fish around here, Mom?

276
00:19:37,624 --> 00:19:40,286
Over there, honey.

277
00:19:42,429 --> 00:19:44,363
Right in the current.

278
00:19:44,431 --> 00:19:46,922
- [Maggie Whimpers]
- Hey there!

279
00:19:49,636 --> 00:19:51,570
We've been waitin' for you.

280
00:19:51,638 --> 00:19:55,597
I should've suspected something
when he had us camp at the walk-out.

281
00:19:55,676 --> 00:19:58,611
Frank and Terry'd been
arguing most of the day.

282
00:19:58,679 --> 00:20:01,614
Frank used to be married
to my sister...

283
00:20:01,682 --> 00:20:03,616
until she realized
what a butthole he was.

284
00:20:03,684 --> 00:20:06,619
Anyway, Frank said things
he shouldn't have said.

285
00:20:06,687 --> 00:20:09,622
And this morning,
we woke up and he was gone.

286
00:20:09,690 --> 00:20:12,716
Why didn't you guys just follow him out,
walk out with him?

287
00:20:12,793 --> 00:20:15,694
That would have been
the smart thing to do...

288
00:20:15,763 --> 00:20:18,163
but I didn't want
to give him the satisfaction.

289
00:20:18,232 --> 00:20:21,201
And what he was doin' with the oars
didn't look that hard...

290
00:20:21,268 --> 00:20:25,534
so we just headed downriver...
and we saw this.

291
00:20:25,606 --> 00:20:28,541
That's when we decided
to wait for you guys.

292
00:20:28,609 --> 00:20:32,204
- Wade said you used to be a guide here.
- Yeah. Roarke, come over here.

293
00:20:32,279 --> 00:20:35,737
Is there any way
we could walk out of here...

294
00:20:35,816 --> 00:20:39,217
- like go up the canyon and...
- Uh, well, you might...

295
00:20:39,286 --> 00:20:42,744
but once you got up
to that canyon rim...

296
00:20:42,823 --> 00:20:46,452
and headed back to the ranger station,
there's a huge gorge.

297
00:20:46,527 --> 00:20:49,155
You'd have to walk around it.

298
00:20:49,229 --> 00:20:52,960
Even if you had the equipment
and knew what you were doing...

299
00:20:53,033 --> 00:20:56,730
and where you were going,
it'd take you five or six days.

300
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:02,673
Looks like we're stuck.

301
00:21:02,743 --> 00:21:04,677
Well, we...

302
00:21:04,745 --> 00:21:09,011
- I could get you as far as Bridal Creek.
- Yeah.

303
00:21:10,184 --> 00:21:13,881
We... wouldn't want
to be a burden.

304
00:21:14,988 --> 00:21:17,218
Well...

305
00:21:17,291 --> 00:21:20,920
it doesn't look
like you have much choice.

306
00:21:20,994 --> 00:21:23,622
All right.

307
00:21:23,697 --> 00:21:26,689
[Gail]
Anyway, it's not as bad as it looks.

308
00:21:26,767 --> 00:21:29,895
- You just got to stay to the right.
- Maggie!

309
00:21:29,970 --> 00:21:32,803
There's a bad hole on the left.
Don't hit that.

310
00:21:32,873 --> 00:21:33,897
No.

311
00:21:33,974 --> 00:21:36,465
[Roarke]
Come on, Mags! Time to go!

312
00:21:36,543 --> 00:21:40,479
Honey, would you go up
and get her?

313
00:21:40,547 --> 00:21:45,143
Stay to the right, and if you
do go swimming, which you won't...

314
00:21:45,219 --> 00:21:49,246
point your feet downstream
and hold on to your jacket.

315
00:21:49,323 --> 00:21:51,587
Just let
the current take you.

316
00:21:51,658 --> 00:21:54,092
Don't command the river.
Let the river command you.

317
00:21:54,161 --> 00:21:58,359
Hey, I don't live my life like that,
and I don't think you do, either.

318
00:21:58,432 --> 00:22:00,297
[Chuckling]

319
00:22:00,367 --> 00:22:02,301
Maggie!

320
00:22:02,369 --> 00:22:04,599
Maggie! Come!

321
00:22:04,671 --> 00:22:06,901
[Whistles]
Come on, girl!

322
00:22:06,974 --> 00:22:10,603
- [Maggie Barking]
- Maggie!

323
00:22:10,677 --> 00:22:12,702
- [Whimpering, Digging]
- Maggie, come.

324
00:22:14,515 --> 00:22:16,642
What do you got there, girl?

325
00:22:16,717 --> 00:22:21,086
- [Digging, Whimpering Continue]
- You all right, girl?

326
00:22:21,154 --> 00:22:23,748
[Roarke]
Maggie, come!

327
00:22:23,824 --> 00:22:26,850
- [Barking]
- Come, Maggie!

328
00:22:30,597 --> 00:22:33,088
[Barking]

329
00:22:33,166 --> 00:22:35,691
Dogs.

330
00:22:35,769 --> 00:22:38,329
Yeah.

331
00:22:44,852 --> 00:22:49,221
- Buckle your life jacket. Stay right.
- [Wade] All right.

332
00:22:49,290 --> 00:22:51,224
- Just relax.
- Relax, huh?

333
00:22:51,292 --> 00:22:54,090
Yeah. Relax.

334
00:22:54,161 --> 00:22:58,063
- I want you to be the best you can be.
- Best I can be.

335
00:22:58,132 --> 00:23:02,432
Let me get down there first.
I'll be waitin' for ya.

336
00:23:02,503 --> 00:23:05,666
All right!
Come on, Maggie! Here we go!

337
00:23:05,740 --> 00:23:07,674
Tom, better put the map away.

It's a... plastic camera.

507
00:34:26,268 --> 00:34:28,202
- It's a waterproof camera.
- Roarke.

508
00:34:29,972 --> 00:34:32,941
- This is from Maggie.
- Yeah, sure.

509
00:34:33,008 --> 00:34:36,307
I think it might be something
you can use on the river.

510
00:34:36,378 --> 00:34:39,074
- Look at it! It's a Swiss army knife!
- Great.

511
00:34:39,147 --> 00:34:42,674
Thanks, Dad!
Look, it's got everything!

512
00:34:42,751 --> 00:34:44,981
- Even the price.
- Yeah.

513
00:34:45,053 --> 00:34:47,146
- [Terry] How much is it?
- Who wants some cake?

514
00:34:47,222 --> 00:34:49,281
- 79.95.
- [Wade] Hey, save me a piece!

515
00:34:49,358 --> 00:34:53,385
Hey, Wade.
Look what I got.

516
00:34:53,462 --> 00:34:56,397
Oh, man, that's great.

517
00:34:56,465 --> 00:35:00,663
Terry and I don't have anything
that fancy, but... this is from us.

518
00:35:00,736 --> 00:35:04,433
Gee, uh, thanks, you guys.

519
00:35:04,506 --> 00:35:06,770
This is...

[Gail]
What is it?

521
00:35:10,045 --> 00:35:13,412
- What do ya got there, bud?
- What is it, honey?

522
00:35:14,816 --> 00:35:17,080
It's $200!

523
00:35:17,152 --> 00:35:22,351
Now, that's so in case you want to see
a concert or buy some CDs or whatever.

524
00:35:22,424 --> 00:35:25,450
That's your money.

525
00:35:25,527 --> 00:35:28,621
It's too much money, Wade.
He can't accept that.

526
00:35:28,697 --> 00:35:34,101
Hey, you guys are savin' our lives.
This is our way of showin' appreciation.

527
00:35:34,169 --> 00:35:37,832
- Can I, Dad?
- It's too much money, Roarke.

528
00:35:37,906 --> 00:35:42,809
Thank you very much for the gesture,
but he can't accept it.

529
00:35:42,878 --> 00:35:45,005
- Roarke, give the money back to him.
- No!

530
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:47,014
- He gave it to me. It's mine.
- Roarke.

531
00:35:47,082 --> 00:35:50,950
Give the money back to him
right now.

532
00:35:56,291 --> 00:35:58,486
- [Roarke Murmuring]
- What did you say?

533
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:01,961
I said, you didn't even
want to come on this trip!

534
00:36:05,367 --> 00:36:09,565
Gee. I'm sorry, Tom.
I was just tryin' to be nice.

535
00:36:21,016 --> 00:36:24,417
I talked to him.
He's okay.

536
00:36:24,486 --> 00:36:26,852
You don't have to
beat yourself up over this.

537
00:36:29,357 --> 00:36:31,848
- You know, you did the right thing.
- Oh!

538
00:36:31,927 --> 00:36:36,091
It's very weird that...
Giving him that money.

539
00:36:36,164 --> 00:36:40,396
I pretty much ruined
his birthday party.

540
00:36:40,469 --> 00:36:44,235
Damn it. Same old story.

541
00:36:44,306 --> 00:36:47,969
Want to know what I think?

542
00:36:48,043 --> 00:36:53,174
I think you spend so much time at work
because you don't like being around me.

543
00:36:53,248 --> 00:36:56,479
Gail, it's not about that.

544
00:36:58,053 --> 00:37:00,886
You set such high standards
for yourself.

545
00:37:00,956 --> 00:37:05,393
Everybody around you. I'm just trying
to come up to your expectations of me.

546
00:37:05,460 --> 00:37:08,759
I'm trying to make you
proud of me again.

547
00:37:17,539 --> 00:37:20,269
Oh, God.
[Sobbing]

548

Oh, God, I'm sorry...

549

if I made you feel
you had to do that.

550
00:37:30,385 --> 00:37:33,320
So... what does it mean?

551
00:37:35,790 --> 00:37:37,849
What are we gonna do?

552
00:37:41,396 --> 00:37:45,127
I think there's only
one thing we can do.

553
00:37:59,848 --> 00:38:02,476
Are you making
a pass at me?

554
00:38:02,551 --> 00:38:06,988
I don't know. Is that what it's called
this far outside of Boston?

555
00:38:08,857 --> 00:38:13,317
This far inside
of marriage, you mean.

556
00:38:13,395 --> 00:38:18,662
I think we're sufficiently alienated
for this to qualify...

557
00:38:18,733 --> 00:38:21,224
as a pass.

00:38:25,540 --> 00:38:27,474

- I'm going to put him to sleep.
- Mm-hmm.

561
00:38:41,756 --> 00:38:44,122

want to make a big deal or scare Roarke.

573
00:40:07,429 --> 00:40:10,227
I just think we have
to get away from them.

574
00:40:10,299 --> 00:40:15,362
Listen, tomorrow, we'll, uh,
act like nothing's happened.

575
00:40:15,437 --> 00:40:19,737

a way to leave them behind.

back here right now.

00:48:02,224 --> 00:48:07,355
Why's that? Because your son
wants to be with me instead of you?

673
00:48:07,429 --> 00:48:10,125
Roarke. Come here.

674
00:48:11,734 --> 00:48:15,465
Look, I'm taking my family
and we're gonna go down the river alone.

675
00:48:15,537 --> 00:48:17,471
That's what we're gonna do.

676
00:48:17,539 --> 00:48:21,202
I'm sorry.
We'll send somebody back to get you.

677
00:48:21,276 --> 00:48:24,677
Who died and made you stud dick
all of a sudden, Tom?

678
00:48:24,747 --> 00:48:27,215
[Gail] You go get in
the boat right now.

679
00:48:27,282 --> 00:48:30,877
Wade, rangers come down here
all the time.

680
00:48:30,953 --> 00:48:35,219
You could hook up with one of them
and get to Bridle Creek ahead of us.

681
00:48:35,290 --> 00:48:38,851
And what if I said
I'm not gonna let you go?

682
00:48:38,927 --> 00:48:43,057
What would you do?

683
00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:53,374
- What would you do, stud?
- [Maggie Barking]

684
00:48:53,442 --> 00:48:55,876
- Hey! What is he...
- Just let him talk to him for a second.

685
00:48:57,412 --> 00:48:59,471
- I don't want to fight with you.
- Oh.

686
00:48:59,548 --> 00:49:02,142
- Wade!
- [Maggie Barking]

687
00:49:02,217 --> 00:49:05,812
I tried to be nice to you.

688
00:49:05,888 --> 00:49:08,516
I tried to be nice
to your family.

689
00:49:08,590 --> 00:49:12,526
And what do you do?
You try and run out on me.

690
00:49:12,594 --> 00:49:15,256
I'm drownin', Tom.

691
00:49:15,330 --> 00:49:17,298
- You wanna hit me?
- [Gasping]

692
00:49:17,366 --> 00:49:20,164
[Maggie Barking]

693
00:49:20,235 --> 00:49:22,203
I'm pullin' you down, Tom.

694
00:49:22,271 --> 00:49:24,364
Whoa!
[Grunting]

695
00:49:24,439 --> 00:49:27,203
- Hit 'im, Dad! Hit 'im.
- [Maggie Barking]

696
00:49:27,276 --> 00:49:30,336
Okay, we're even.
You hit me, I hit you. It's over.

697
00:49:30,412 --> 00:49:33,870
Now, I'm takin' my family
and I'm leavin'.

698
00:49:33,949 --> 00:49:36,713
- No, you're not.
- Look out, Dad! He's got a gun!

699
00:49:39,955 --> 00:49:42,048
Roarke.

700
00:49:46,662 --> 00:49:49,358
- Don't! Damn it! [Grunting]
- [Maggie Barking]

701
00:49:50,933 --> 00:49:53,800
It's not gonna be that easy.

702
00:49:53,869 --> 00:49:56,133
Get off of her!

703
00:50:00,175 --> 00:50:02,370
- Get off me!
- [Grunting]

704
00:50:02,444 --> 00:50:04,571
- [Growling]
- Get! Get!

705
00:50:04,646 --> 00:50:06,944
- [Maggie Whimpering]
- [Groaning]

706
00:50:08,817 --> 00:50:11,945
Don't, Wade! Stop!
He's my dad! Stop hitting him!

707
00:50:12,020 --> 00:50:14,921
- [Maggie Barking]
- This is not fun anymore.

708
00:50:14,990 --> 00:50:17,584
- [Gail] Oh, God, no!
- Wade!

709
00:50:17,659 --> 00:50:21,425
Wade, please!
God, please, don't...

710
00:50:26,501 --> 00:50:28,935
I need your wife
to get me down the river.

711
00:50:29,004 --> 00:50:33,441
- I need your son to control her.
- [Maggie Barking]

712
00:50:33,508 --> 00:50:36,272
- You and the dog are expendable.
- [Maggie Barking]

713
00:50:36,345 --> 00:50:40,839
- [Barking Continues]
- Right now, I think I'll get rid of...

714
00:50:40,916 --> 00:50:43,282
- [Barking]
- The dog.

715
00:50:43,352 --> 00:50:46,014
No! Run, Mags, run!

716
00:50:46,088 --> 00:50:49,854
Run, Maggie, run!
Run! Run!

717
00:51:09,378 --> 00:51:11,778
You got guts, Roarke.

718
00:51:13,916 --> 00:51:17,613
But you shouldn't have
broken your promise about the gun.

719
00:51:19,888 --> 00:51:22,686
Friends don't do that.

720
00:51:26,495 --> 00:51:28,793
I thought you were a nice guy.

721
00:51:28,864 --> 00:51:32,163
I am a nice guy.

722
00:51:33,235 --> 00:51:35,897
Just a different kind
of nice guy.

723
00:51:45,314 --> 00:51:49,410
Damn, Terry.
Looks like we lose our deposit.

724
00:51:49,484 --> 00:51:52,544
[Wade Laughing]
All right!

725
00:51:52,621 --> 00:51:55,351
Now that I'm head of the family,
here's what we're gonna do!

726
00:51:55,424 --> 00:52:00,225
We're gonna haul ass down this river.
No more fishing. No more sightseeing.

727
00:52:00,295 --> 00:52:04,095
And unfortunately,
no more skinny dipping.

728
00:52:04,166 --> 00:52:05,599
- By the way, Gail...
- [Clicking]

729
00:52:05,667 --> 00:52:08,227
You're gonna get another chance
to run the Gauntlet.

730
00:52:08,303 --> 00:52:11,670
- We're not stopping at Bridle Creek.
- What?

731
00:52:11,740 --> 00:52:16,268
That's right. Come on, let's get
this shit up the hill and outta sight!

732
00:52:20,215 --> 00:52:22,740
Roarke.

733
00:52:22,818 --> 00:52:25,412
Were you takin'
pictures of me?

734
00:52:26,355 --> 00:52:28,550
Give me that camera.

735
00:52:30,425 --> 00:52:32,757
[Sighing]
