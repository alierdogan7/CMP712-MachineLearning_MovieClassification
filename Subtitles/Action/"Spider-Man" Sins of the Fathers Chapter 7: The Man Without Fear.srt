2
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:52,635
- Nice save!
- Thanks.

3
00:01:55,838 --> 00:01:57,779
We've got to get that data disk
before it melts away...

4
00:01:57,821 --> 00:02:00,209
any chance
of clearing Peter Parker.

5
00:02:01,532 --> 00:02:05,272
Here, wouldn't want you
to lose this. Come on.

6
00:02:05,306 --> 00:02:07,923
Why are you so interested
in helping Parker?

7
00:02:07,961 --> 00:02:10,349
I like his work.
He always shoots my good side.

8
00:02:16,725 --> 00:02:17,903
Daredevil, hang on!

9
00:02:17,941 --> 00:02:21,006
I hate to leave you,
but if I don't get that disk...

10
00:02:21,043 --> 00:02:23,082
Peter Parker will be cooked.

11
00:02:25,681 --> 00:02:28,647
I hope this software
isn't soft-boiled yet.

12
00:02:28,689 --> 00:02:31,535
Download complete. Yes!

13
00:02:31,567 --> 00:02:33,061
Get away from that computer.

14
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:41,190
He's done for.
Let's get out of here!

15
00:02:45,121 --> 00:02:47,095
This time I'm getting you
out of here.

16
00:02:47,136 --> 00:02:49,240
How? You can't see your way
through this smoke.

17
00:02:49,279 --> 00:02:51,451
Maybe some of us look at the
world differently than others.

18
00:02:55,133 --> 00:02:57,172
Thanks. You saved me.

19
00:02:57,212 --> 00:02:59,448
Actually, I was saving
Peter Parker.

20
00:02:59,483 --> 00:03:01,654
- Excuse me?
- You got that disk, right?

21
00:03:01,691 --> 00:03:05,301
Oh, yeah, right. The disk.
This data will clear Parker.

22
00:03:05,337 --> 00:03:06,897
Get it to your pal,
Matt Murdock.

23
00:03:06,936 --> 00:03:09,934
I'm sure he'll be grateful...
as I am... for everything.

24
00:03:09,975 --> 00:03:11,731
Hey, we're even.

25
00:03:11,767 --> 00:03:13,654
Since you and I appear
to be on the same team...

26
00:03:13,686 --> 00:03:16,881
I should tell you who our
real adversary is in all this.

27
00:03:16,916 --> 00:03:19,184
His name is Wilson Fisk.

28
00:03:19,219 --> 00:03:21,007
The entrepreneur
and philanthropist?

29
00:03:21,042 --> 00:03:22,417
That's all a facade.

30
00:03:22,450 --> 00:03:25,067
Fisk is really a devious
criminal mastermind...

31
00:03:25,104 --> 00:03:28,267
who calls himself
the Kingpin.

32
00:03:28,303 --> 00:03:30,441
Wilson Fisk? Wait a minute.

33
00:03:30,478 --> 00:03:33,195
That would explain why
the Hobgoblin was after him.

34
00:03:33,230 --> 00:03:34,440
Spider sense!

35
00:03:36,076 --> 00:03:38,115
Federal agents! Freeze!

36
00:03:38,155 --> 00:03:39,681
Let's split up. Move!

37
00:03:39,722 --> 00:03:41,478
Stop them! Stop them!

38
00:03:41,514 --> 00:03:43,171
Time to pack it in
for the night.

39
00:03:43,209 --> 00:03:44,802
Hope Daredevil got away, too.

40
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:49,988
Agent Choi, I need to talk
to you about Peter Parker.

41
00:03:50,022 --> 00:03:51,450
He is no traitor...

42
00:03:51,494 --> 00:03:53,631
and you certainly can't
blame him for this.

43
00:03:53,668 --> 00:03:55,840
I'm a little busy, Detective.

44
00:03:55,876 --> 00:03:57,533
Have you followed up
on the other leads?

45
00:03:57,572 --> 00:04:00,538
Who's the guy in the red suit?
How are the Fisks involved?

46
00:04:00,578 --> 00:04:02,300
Why are you rushing
to judgment...

47
00:04:02,337 --> 00:04:03,896
before you've
fully investigated?

48
00:04:03,937 --> 00:04:06,457
As far as I'm concerned,
this investigation is over.

49
00:04:06,496 --> 00:04:08,317
All that's left
is capturing Parker.

50
00:04:08,351 --> 00:04:10,041
You're out of your
jurisdiction here.

51
00:04:10,078 --> 00:04:12,313
Now get lost or I'll have you
hauled in for a reprimand!

52
00:04:15,771 --> 00:04:19,894
Every trace of the secret data
has gone up in flames.

53
00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:21,424
And so has my building.

54
00:04:21,466 --> 00:04:25,392
Yes. But my plan
to frame Parker is succeeding.

55
00:04:25,431 --> 00:04:27,951
Wrong. Peter Parker has escaped.

56
00:04:27,991 --> 00:04:29,234
- What?
- Fools!

57
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:32,269
With Parker loose, the whole
scheme may be in jeopardy.

58
00:04:32,309 --> 00:04:34,763
It's worse than you think.

59
00:04:34,803 --> 00:04:37,071
Take a look at what
our security camera taped.

60
00:04:37,106 --> 00:04:39,888
How did Spider-Man
know where to look?

61
00:04:39,922 --> 00:04:41,644
Who is leaking information?

62
00:04:41,681 --> 00:04:44,461
This is all your fault.
It was your bad idea...

63
00:04:44,496 --> 00:04:46,350
to frame Parker
in the first place.

64
00:04:46,382 --> 00:04:49,132
But the feds were onto our
data-smuggling operation.

65
00:04:49,166 --> 00:04:52,361
It seemed like the most elegant
way to throw them off our trail.

66
00:04:52,396 --> 00:04:55,395
We are under even more scrutiny
now than before.

67
00:04:55,435 --> 00:04:59,045
And at this moment,
Spider-Man may hold...

68
00:04:59,081 --> 00:05:01,601
the most incriminating
evidence against me.

69
00:05:01,641 --> 00:05:03,778
- May Parker...
- Wait. Listen to this.

70
00:05:03,816 --> 00:05:05,953
...the aunt of fugitive
Peter Parker...

71
00:05:05,991 --> 00:05:07,746
reportedly collapsed
in her home.

72
00:05:07,781 --> 00:05:09,985
She's been rushed
to Mercy Memorial Hospital.

73
00:05:10,021 --> 00:05:12,955
A glimmer of light
through the gloom.

74
00:05:12,996 --> 00:05:16,671
Should Parker be stupid enough
to visit his ailing aunt...

75
00:05:16,706 --> 00:05:19,094
see to it that we are there
to welcome him.

76
00:05:19,137 --> 00:05:23,544
We may have lost the data disk,
but we will have Parker.

77
00:05:28,286 --> 00:05:30,325
Mr. Murdock?

78
00:05:30,364 --> 00:05:33,014
Looks like I've got
the place to myself.

79
00:05:33,052 --> 00:05:36,399
Let's see what the news says
about tonight's little bonfire.

80
00:05:36,442 --> 00:05:38,383
Parker's aunt collapsed and was
rushed to Mercy Memorial.

81
00:05:38,425 --> 00:05:39,734
What?

82
00:05:39,768 --> 00:05:42,419
At this time, there is no word
on how serious her condition is.

83
00:05:42,456 --> 00:05:43,470
Aunt May!

84
00:05:44,567 --> 00:05:46,606
Good news, Peter.
Daredevil has given us...

85
00:05:46,646 --> 00:05:48,620
the evidence we need
to appeal your conviction.

86
00:05:48,661 --> 00:05:50,798
Matt, my Aunt May's
in the hospital.

87
00:05:50,836 --> 00:05:52,242
I've gotta see her right away!

88
00:05:52,276 --> 00:05:55,406
I'd have to advise against that.
You're still an escaped felon.

89
00:05:55,443 --> 00:05:57,743
It would be wiser to cooperate
with the authorities...

90
00:05:57,778 --> 00:05:59,184
and turn yourself in.

91
00:05:59,216 --> 00:06:02,346
I can't waste the time now.
If anything happens to her...

92
00:06:02,383 --> 00:06:05,230
You have no idea what it's like
to lose someone you love.

93
00:06:05,262 --> 00:06:07,083
Maybe I know
better than you think.

94
00:06:07,118 --> 00:06:10,378
As your attorney,
I must advise against this.

95
00:06:10,411 --> 00:06:12,898
But as your friend,
I understand.

96
00:06:12,938 --> 00:06:14,399
I'll take the disk to the feds.

97
00:06:14,442 --> 00:06:16,831
Maybe I can persuade them
to suspend their dragnet.

98
00:06:16,873 --> 00:06:19,523
Just be careful.
You're still a fugitive.

99
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:20,934
If anyone sees you...

100
00:06:20,967 --> 00:06:23,170
they might shoot first
and ask questions later.

101
00:06:23,206 --> 00:06:24,961
I won't be seen.

102
00:06:34,626 --> 00:06:35,901
Will she be OK, doctor?

103
00:06:35,937 --> 00:06:39,613
It's too soon to tell. She's
been under a lot of stress.

104
00:06:39,648 --> 00:06:42,167
I'll check back
in a little while.

105
00:06:42,207 --> 00:06:45,434
That Peter. What he puts
May through is unforgivable.

106
00:06:45,469 --> 00:06:47,257
I don't care
what trouble he's in!

107
00:06:47,293 --> 00:06:49,626
His place is here
with his ailing aunt.

108
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:51,033
If I were Peter Parker...

109
00:06:51,067 --> 00:06:53,521
wild horses
couldn't keep me away.

110
00:06:53,562 --> 00:06:56,724
I swear, sometimes I think
May would be better off...

111
00:06:56,761 --> 00:06:59,542
if they caught Peter
and locked him up until...

112
00:06:59,576 --> 00:07:02,673
Aunt Anna, that's enough.
I won't listen to this anymore.

113
00:07:02,710 --> 00:07:04,782
What was that all about?

114
00:07:04,821 --> 00:07:08,048
Mary Jane doesn't like hearing
bad things about Peter.

115
00:07:09,684 --> 00:07:11,723
You OK?

116
00:07:11,763 --> 00:07:13,485
Not really, Harry, no.

117
00:07:13,522 --> 00:07:16,422
It's Peter.
I'm so worried about him.

118
00:07:20,815 --> 00:07:25,319
The data on this disk proves
that my client is innocent.

119
00:07:25,357 --> 00:07:27,331
- How did you get it?
- Let's just say...

120
00:07:27,372 --> 00:07:29,193
Peter has people
looking out for him.

121
00:07:29,227 --> 00:07:31,648
I need a receipt. The only copy.

122
00:07:31,690 --> 00:07:33,544
Time is of the essence,
Mr. Murdock.

123
00:07:33,578 --> 00:07:35,998
My people are tracking Parker.
They might shoot him on sight.

124
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:37,665
Point well taken.

125
00:07:37,703 --> 00:07:39,229
I must make
immediate arrangements...

126
00:07:39,271 --> 00:07:41,213
to protect
and exonerate Parker.

127
00:07:45,029 --> 00:07:48,572
- Yes?
- I have the package you wanted.

128
00:07:59,774 --> 00:08:01,464
Peter!

129
00:08:01,501 --> 00:08:05,079
What are you doing here?
There are police everywhere.

130
00:08:05,116 --> 00:08:08,278
I need your help. You haven't
given up on me, have you?

131
00:08:08,315 --> 00:08:11,128
Never. You can always
count on me.

132
00:08:12,601 --> 00:08:15,916
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to...
Harry and I are...

133
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:18,828
I know. Listen, I must
get in to see Aunt May.

134
00:08:18,871 --> 00:08:21,357
- Can you think of a way?
- Leave it to me.

135
00:08:23,285 --> 00:08:25,194
There you are, Dr. Peters.

136
00:08:25,236 --> 00:08:29,195
Mrs. Parker's taken a turn
for the worse. Hurry!

137
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,701
Aunt May, can you hear me?

138
00:08:33,743 --> 00:08:36,427
Peter, you're here.

139
00:08:36,464 --> 00:08:37,892
Everything's gonna be OK.

140
00:08:37,934 --> 00:08:40,421
Mr. Murdock has evidence
that will clear me.

141
00:08:40,461 --> 00:08:44,682
I told them you were innocent.
My Peter is a good boy.

142
00:08:44,715 --> 00:08:46,308
She should rest now, Peter.

143
00:08:47,339 --> 00:08:49,225
I'd better get out of here.

144
00:08:49,258 --> 00:08:51,231
I may be placing
both of you in danger.

145
00:08:51,273 --> 00:08:52,200
Now what?

146
00:08:52,232 --> 00:08:54,652
You? Why, of all the nerve!

147
00:08:54,696 --> 00:08:56,735
Anna Watson activated
my spider sense?

148
00:08:56,775 --> 00:08:58,879
She must be really mad at me.

149
00:08:58,918 --> 00:09:03,455
Oh, Anna, it's wonderful.
That nice lawyer Mr. Murdock...

150
00:09:03,491 --> 00:09:05,759
has proof
that Peter is innocent.

151
00:09:05,795 --> 00:09:09,110
- I'm happy to hear it. Really.
- I've gotta go.

152
00:09:09,154 --> 00:09:11,541
There are still a few people
who haven't heard the news.

153
00:09:11,584 --> 00:09:14,452
I see. Then you'll need help
getting out of here.

154
00:09:14,496 --> 00:09:16,349
Let me do what I can.

155
00:09:16,382 --> 00:09:19,829
Why is my spider sense
still going crazy?

156
00:09:27,226 --> 00:09:30,542
Excuse me, Doctor. Have you seen
my niece Mary Jane?

157
00:09:30,585 --> 00:09:32,526
It's sure nice of you
to help, Aunt Anna.

158
00:09:32,568 --> 00:09:35,316
Oh, I'm not doing this
entirely for Peter.

159
00:09:35,351 --> 00:09:38,284
It's more for my own benefit.

160
00:09:40,277 --> 00:09:41,324
Chameleon!

161
00:09:55,593 --> 00:09:57,828
Nice work, Agent Choi.

162
00:09:57,864 --> 00:10:01,178
My father knew his investment
in you would pay off.

163
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:18,650
Thanks for calling me
right away, Detective Lee.

164
00:10:18,687 --> 00:10:21,752
That disk was Parker's
one chance to be exonerated.

165
00:10:21,789 --> 00:10:24,571
There'll be the devil
to pay for this.

166
00:10:24,604 --> 00:10:27,702
Data on this disk
could've destroyed my father.

167
00:10:27,739 --> 00:10:30,127
He'll be pleased
with all we've done.

168
00:10:31,610 --> 00:10:32,721
What is it, Richard?

169
00:10:32,761 --> 00:10:35,794
Father, I have
the data disk and Parker.

170
00:10:35,832 --> 00:10:38,700
I've taken care
of all your problems.

171
00:10:38,742 --> 00:10:43,344
Splendid. I shall await news
that you've eradicated both.

172
00:10:43,381 --> 00:10:46,958
You see, Smythe, my son
has cleaned up your mess.

173
00:10:46,995 --> 00:10:48,271
How touching.

174
00:10:48,307 --> 00:10:51,272
It is. I must say,
it pleases me greatly...

175
00:10:51,314 --> 00:10:53,385
knowing that my relationship
with my son...

176
00:10:53,424 --> 00:10:56,107
is nothing like I went through
with my own father.

177
00:10:56,144 --> 00:10:58,150
Your father. It occurs to me...

178
00:10:58,190 --> 00:11:00,361
I know very little
about your past.

179
00:11:00,398 --> 00:11:01,957
What was your father like?

180
00:11:01,997 --> 00:11:04,330
What is the best way to say it?

181
00:11:04,363 --> 00:11:07,527
I believe "small-time hood"
sums it up.

182
00:11:07,563 --> 00:11:09,951
But my father wanted more
out of life.

183
00:11:09,994 --> 00:11:13,124
He wanted to become
a member of the mob.

184
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:16,507
As for myself, I was lonely...

185
00:11:16,551 --> 00:11:19,714
ostracized because of my weight.

186
00:11:22,788 --> 00:11:25,372
My father had great dreams.

187
00:11:25,410 --> 00:11:28,606
But things never went
my father's way.

188
00:11:29,986 --> 00:11:31,643
Willy, what are you
doing here?!

189
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:33,273
Come on! Let's go!

190
00:11:33,312 --> 00:11:37,620
Whatever my father touched
turned positively putrid.

191
00:11:40,413 --> 00:11:42,899
Over the years,
I tried to join my father...

192
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:47,672
in his business pursuits.
I wanted to gain his acceptance.

193
00:11:47,706 --> 00:11:49,528
I failed.

194
00:11:51,417 --> 00:11:54,285
Sometimes sacrifices
must be made.

195
00:11:54,327 --> 00:11:57,293
Sorry, son,
that's the way things are.

196
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:05,586
Young man, this court
is willing to show leniency...

197
00:12:05,618 --> 00:12:08,683
but you must name
your accomplice.

198
00:12:08,721 --> 00:12:10,607
Now I was all alone.

199
00:12:10,641 --> 00:12:13,901
I realized I was going
to have to learn to survive...

200
00:12:13,936 --> 00:12:17,643
or be destroyed,
and I did learn.

201
00:12:17,678 --> 00:12:20,905
By the time I got out,
I had acquired all the skills...

202
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:24,005
needed to begin building
my criminal empire.

203
00:12:24,044 --> 00:12:26,824
I even took a new name... Fisk.

204
00:12:26,858 --> 00:12:30,947
But I quickly became known
as "The Kingpin."

205
00:12:30,983 --> 00:12:33,220
I used my mastery
of technology...

206
00:12:33,255 --> 00:12:36,123
to break into the law
enforcement computer system...

207
00:12:36,166 --> 00:12:39,361
and to eradicate all records of
my previous criminal identity.

208
00:12:39,397 --> 00:12:42,875
Only one thing remained
to link me to the past.

209
00:12:42,915 --> 00:12:45,118
We found him for you, Kingpin.

210
00:12:45,155 --> 00:12:47,259
It is you! Nobody believed me...

211
00:12:47,297 --> 00:12:52,084
but I knew the famous Kingpin
was really my boy Willy.

212
00:12:52,126 --> 00:12:54,646
Wrong! As far as
the world must know...

213
00:12:54,687 --> 00:12:57,849
Willy ceased to exist
when you left him in prison.

214
00:12:57,884 --> 00:13:00,338
Now it's your turn.

215
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:04,120
No! Please!
Willy, don't do this!

216
00:13:04,153 --> 00:13:07,088
I knew you were ruthless,
but this...

217
00:13:07,129 --> 00:13:09,615
Sacrifices must be made.

218
00:13:19,508 --> 00:13:22,801
Let her go! You've got me!

219
00:13:24,242 --> 00:13:25,518
It's hard to believe...

220
00:13:25,553 --> 00:13:27,495
after all the risks
I took as Spider-Man...

221
00:13:27,536 --> 00:13:30,382
that Parker is gonna be
the one to take the fall.

222
00:13:30,415 --> 00:13:32,389
If only I could save
the woman I love.

223
00:13:34,030 --> 00:13:35,817
You've been here before.

224
00:13:35,853 --> 00:13:38,308
This time
I'll make sure it works.

225
00:13:38,348 --> 00:13:41,194
It will all be over
in a matter of minutes.

226
00:13:41,227 --> 00:13:42,535
Peter, what's going on?

227
00:13:43,913 --> 00:13:46,301
It's Terri Lee!
What's she doing here?

228
00:13:48,008 --> 00:13:49,633
We'll have to fight.

229
00:13:50,695 --> 00:13:51,807
Police!

230
00:13:51,846 --> 00:13:53,155
Take cover!

231
00:14:03,137 --> 00:14:04,925
I can hardly breathe.

232
00:14:09,471 --> 00:14:11,543
Time to even the odds.

233
00:14:15,836 --> 00:14:17,624
Look out!

234
00:14:32,086 --> 00:14:33,645
Nice work, Detective.

235
00:14:33,685 --> 00:14:38,385
I cannot bear incompetence.
Execute the contingency plan!

236
00:14:38,419 --> 00:14:40,719
Take cover over here.
I'll be back.

237
00:14:49,646 --> 00:14:52,067
With all that movement,
my spider sense...

238
00:14:52,109 --> 00:14:54,149
can't lock in on who's who!

239
00:15:00,074 --> 00:15:02,560
No doubt now
who the impostor is.

240
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:04,934
Only the real thing could
do that with a billy club.

241
00:15:04,968 --> 00:15:07,356
Catch you later.
I've got to check on a friend.

242
00:15:08,743 --> 00:15:10,368
Nice moves.

243
00:15:10,406 --> 00:15:12,990
Hey, I'm a single woman
living in New York.

244
00:15:13,028 --> 00:15:14,971
Self-defense classes are a must.

245
00:15:16,931 --> 00:15:18,588
Going my way?

246
00:15:18,626 --> 00:15:19,608
Chameleon!

247
00:15:22,944 --> 00:15:23,892
Book him.

248
00:15:25,504 --> 00:15:26,878
Up there!

249
00:15:37,594 --> 00:15:39,633
I know this place.

250
00:15:39,673 --> 00:15:42,934
I was here when a crook named
"The Hobgoblin" took it over.

251
00:15:42,968 --> 00:15:44,974
Good. Since you're familiar
with the layout...

252
00:15:45,015 --> 00:15:46,389
why don't you keep
security busy...

253
00:15:46,423 --> 00:15:48,756
while I settle
some unfinished business?

254
00:15:48,911 --> 00:15:52,455
Can you guys tell me where
the little spider's room is?

255
00:15:56,267 --> 00:15:58,372
Where is the other one?!

256
00:15:58,411 --> 00:16:02,152
Right here, Kingpin,
and the name's Daredevil.

257
00:16:02,185 --> 00:16:06,274
You would have to be a daredevil
to dare to challenge me.

258
00:16:06,311 --> 00:16:09,027
I'm taking your family.
The police have your son...

259
00:16:09,063 --> 00:16:11,909
- and I have you.
- My son?!

260
00:16:21,217 --> 00:16:23,834
You are weak! Useless!

261
00:16:23,873 --> 00:16:26,741
You are weak, Willy! Useless!

262
00:16:28,158 --> 00:16:31,289
This time, the fight is mine!

263
00:16:35,292 --> 00:16:38,073
Father, no!

264
00:16:38,106 --> 00:16:39,600
Father, no!

265
00:16:41,881 --> 00:16:44,879
- Now you're mine.
- No, you're mine!

266
00:16:46,999 --> 00:16:50,226
Hold on, Moby Dick!
Time for me to reel you in!

267
00:16:54,867 --> 00:16:56,754
Empty? Not now!

268
00:17:00,625 --> 00:17:02,086
We can't let him get away.

269
00:17:05,136 --> 00:17:08,036
Hang on to your cowl.
Take her down, pal!

270
00:17:08,077 --> 00:17:10,280
The only thing
going down is you!

271
00:17:13,164 --> 00:17:16,163
Let's hope he's good
at blind landings.

272
00:17:25,095 --> 00:17:27,133
Helpless as a beached whale.

273
00:17:27,174 --> 00:17:30,336
I'm afraid the Kingpin's
had the last laugh again.

274
00:17:31,844 --> 00:17:33,948
Chameleon! How did you guess?

275
00:17:33,986 --> 00:17:36,223
I can see through disguises.

276
00:17:36,258 --> 00:17:38,232
The real Kingpin
must've made the switch...

277
00:17:38,274 --> 00:17:39,582
back at Crime Central.

278
00:17:39,617 --> 00:17:41,558
Well, at least
he's still got the CD-ROM...

279
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:43,541
that proves
Peter Parker is innocent.

280
00:17:43,582 --> 00:17:46,135
Wait a minute. If you can
see through disguises...

281
00:17:46,174 --> 00:17:47,996
does that mean
you've seen through mine?

282
00:17:48,029 --> 00:17:50,613
No, I've respected
your right to privacy.

283
00:17:50,652 --> 00:17:54,741
I'm a big believer
in the constitution and the law.

284
00:17:54,778 --> 00:17:57,974
This court finds
Richard Fisk, Susan Choi...

285
00:17:58,010 --> 00:18:01,139
and the criminal known
as "The Chameleon" guilty.

286
00:18:03,030 --> 00:18:05,298
This court is willing
to show leniency...

287
00:18:05,334 --> 00:18:08,301
but you must name
your accomplices, if any.

288
00:18:08,341 --> 00:18:11,241
Sacrifices must be made.

289
00:18:12,819 --> 00:18:16,265
I must apologize for
the trouble you went through.

290
00:18:16,306 --> 00:18:19,567
I did not realize my son
was stealing secrets.

291
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:22,446
I can't believe
I have to swallow this.

292
00:18:22,479 --> 00:18:24,517
But if I let on that I know
he's a criminal...

293
00:18:24,558 --> 00:18:25,866
he can figure out who I am.

294
00:18:25,902 --> 00:18:27,308
Apology accepted.

295
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:31,202
But watch it, Kingpin.
Spider-Man now knows the truth.

296
00:18:32,395 --> 00:18:35,044
I've had it
with your bungling, Smythe.

297
00:18:35,082 --> 00:18:38,463
Your days here are numbered.
Leave me!

298
00:18:43,238 --> 00:18:46,433
Now, how many days
shall I have to wait...

299
00:18:46,468 --> 00:18:50,112
for my son to exact his revenge?

300
00:18:51,171 --> 00:18:52,731
Jonah, I don't understand.

301
00:18:52,771 --> 00:18:55,737
Why won't you let me tell Parker
that you paid for his defense?

302
00:18:55,777 --> 00:18:58,525
Lt'd spoil my image. Besides...

303
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:00,926
I don't want Parker getting
the idea I like him.

304
00:19:00,959 --> 00:19:02,300
Which reminds me, Robbie...

305
00:19:02,334 --> 00:19:05,366
who told you you could
offer Parker his job back?

306
00:19:05,405 --> 00:19:08,534
That goofy kid couldn't focus
if his life depended on it!

307
00:19:08,572 --> 00:19:11,605
- So, you're leaving?
- Murdock's been called to D. C...

308
00:19:11,643 --> 00:19:13,846
on special assignment
for the justice department.

309
00:19:13,882 --> 00:19:16,270
It's up to you to hold
Kingpin at bay here...

310
00:19:16,312 --> 00:19:18,318
while Murdock and I gather
enough legal evidence...

311
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:20,082
to put him behind bars forever.

312
00:19:20,119 --> 00:19:23,434
You know, I just realized that
I don't know much about you.

313
00:19:23,478 --> 00:19:25,866
How did you and Murdock
first join forces?

314
00:19:25,908 --> 00:19:28,144
It's unfortunate
that we masked men...

315
00:19:28,179 --> 00:19:30,218
must hide so much
from the world.

316
00:19:30,258 --> 00:19:32,941
But there is one thing
you do need to know.

317
00:19:32,978 --> 00:19:36,773
Behind this mask
is the face of a friend...

318
00:19:36,816 --> 00:19:41,123
and a lifelong partner
in your war against Kingpin.

319
00:19:41,166 --> 00:19:42,953
Thanks.

320
00:19:44,749 --> 00:19:47,082
Good-bye, Daredevil,
and don't worry.

321
00:19:47,115 --> 00:19:49,024
I'm going to fight
the Kingpin...

322
00:19:49,067 --> 00:19:51,783
to the bitter end, so help me.

323
00:19:54,783 --> 00:19:58,783
