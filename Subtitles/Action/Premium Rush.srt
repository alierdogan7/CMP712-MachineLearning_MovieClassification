1041
01:03:34,178 --> 01:03:37,706
The Buddha rejected all that.
He insisted on
cause and effect.

1042
01:03:38,082 --> 01:03:39,345
What kind of
bike messenger are you?

1043
01:03:39,417 --> 01:03:40,441
(BOTH LAUGH)

1044
01:03:40,518 --> 01:03:43,579
The kind with a Masters
in Bullshit and Obfuscation.

1045
01:03:44,055 --> 01:03:45,250
(LAUGHS)

1046
01:03:45,323 --> 01:03:47,758
You still haven't answered
my original question.

1047
01:03:47,825 --> 01:03:50,693
Aren't you afraid of dying?
I mean, the way you ride.

1048
01:03:50,761 --> 01:03:51,956
You wanna know
what scares me

1049
01:03:52,029 --> 01:03:54,464
is what happened
to my friends who just
got out of law school.

1050
01:03:54,565 --> 01:03:57,057
That is collective insanity.

1051
01:03:57,335 --> 01:04:00,396
Compared to that,
going down Broadway
at 50 with no brakes is fine.

1052
01:04:00,471 --> 01:04:01,495
Sounds good.

1053
01:04:01,572 --> 01:04:03,006
It also sounds like bullshit.

1054
01:04:03,474 --> 01:04:06,308
The bike wants to go fast.
It's steadier that way.

1055
01:04:06,377 --> 01:04:08,539
I've never been hurt
going all-out.

1056
01:04:08,612 --> 01:04:11,343
It's just the hesitation
that'll kill you.

1057
01:04:11,916 --> 01:04:14,647
So you're one of those guys.
No brakes.

1058
01:04:14,719 --> 01:04:16,051
No, I hate brakes.

1059
01:04:16,387 --> 01:04:18,117
Brakes are death.

You back?

1075
01:05:02,600 --> 01:05:03,761
Where's my bike?

1076
01:05:03,934 --> 01:05:05,197
Yeah, you're back.

1077
01:05:05,636 --> 01:05:07,229
Where's my bike, seriously?
Relax. Relax.

1078
01:05:07,371 --> 01:05:08,669
I can't leave
without the bike.

1079
01:05:08,806 --> 01:05:10,365
I'm going with him.
No.

1080
01:05:10,441 --> 01:05:11,909
What the hell are you doing?
You stay here.

1081
01:05:11,976 --> 01:05:13,808
Hey,
I need some help over here.
This woman is unruly.

1082
01:05:13,878 --> 01:05:14,971
What?
Calm down.

1083
01:05:15,045 --> 01:05:16,980
I didn't even do anything.
You got to relax.

1084
01:05:17,047 --> 01:05:18,140
Fine. Okay.

1085
01:05:18,215 --> 01:05:19,808
Is this my bag?
Thank you, I appreciate that.

1086
01:05:19,884 --> 01:05:22,353
Hopefully there's
nothing missing.
This crazy man...

1087
01:05:22,453 --> 01:05:25,082
I don't care what happened!
Because you tackled me!

1088
01:05:25,156 --> 01:05:26,215
I didn't mean to tackle you.

1089
01:05:26,290 --> 01:05:28,521
Just FYI,
there's a lawsuit happening.

1090
01:05:28,592 --> 01:05:30,083
I'm not saying
I'm gonna do it or whatnot,

1091
01:05:30,161 --> 01:05:32,562
but there is one coming.
Thank you.

1092
01:05:34,532 --> 01:05:36,728
All right, come on.
Get your stuff.

1093
01:05:36,901 --> 01:05:38,392
Hey, chief,
I need to talk to you.

1094
01:05:40,938 --> 01:05:42,372
Hey, what's up?
I need to talk to you.

1095
01:05:42,440 --> 01:05:43,772
Uh, did he come to?

1096
01:05:43,841 --> 01:05:45,139
Yeah. He's awake.
A little messed up.

1097
01:05:45,209 --> 01:05:46,871
He's got a couple
of bruised ribs,
but he'll be all right.

1098
01:05:46,944 --> 01:05:49,004
Listen,
I gotta ask you a favor.
Yeah, shoot.

1099
01:05:49,079 --> 01:05:50,843
I have got to talk to
this guy right away.

1100
01:05:50,915 --> 01:05:52,076
V?

1101
01:05:53,417 --> 01:05:54,646
The bike.

1102
01:05:56,987 --> 01:05:59,616
MONDAY: His partner got away.
I gotta find him
before he gets too far.

1103
01:05:59,690 --> 01:06:01,886
Is there any way
I could ride and ask him
a couple of questions?

1104
01:06:01,959 --> 01:06:03,086
What, right now?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1105
01:06:03,160 --> 01:06:05,629
If I could just sit with him
on the way to the hospital?

1106
01:06:05,696 --> 01:06:07,187
That's very unusual.
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

1107
01:06:07,364 --> 01:06:09,856
Well, NYPD needs a favor.
Okay?

1108
01:06:10,134 --> 01:06:11,466
Okay, chum?

1109
01:06:11,535 --> 01:06:12,662
All right,
come and ride with us.

1110
01:06:12,736 --> 01:06:13,795

Hey, buddy?
Hey, buddy? Hey...

1114
01:06:20,945 --> 01:06:23,471
Ah, they're not your buddies.
You're one of
these bike assholes.

1115
01:06:23,547 --> 01:06:24,776
You know how
much time they waste

1116
01:06:24,849 --> 01:06:26,044
scraping you shitheads
off the street?

1117
01:06:26,116 --> 01:06:28,176
This whole city hates you.

1118
01:06:33,324 --> 01:06:36,055
Hey, man.
You headed to the impound?

1119
01:06:36,126 --> 01:06:37,458
Yeah. Why?

1120
01:06:37,528 --> 01:06:40,054
Good. Take this thing.
I'll meet you there.

1121
01:06:40,130 --> 01:06:43,225
When this asshole
comes for his bike,
he's mine.

1122
01:06:51,842 --> 01:06:53,401
Time to quit
dicking around, son.

1123
01:06:53,477 --> 01:06:56,242
You got involved
with some people
with real problems.

1124
01:06:56,313 --> 01:06:58,908
Real deadlines.
Life and death shit.

1125
01:06:58,983 --> 01:07:01,009
What is this to you?

1126
01:07:01,085 --> 01:07:03,611
What, the slope that
gave you the ticket,
she gave you some sad story?

1127
01:07:03,721 --> 01:07:06,122
Eighteen cousins in Fujian
that wanna come to Chinatown,

1128
01:07:06,190 --> 01:07:08,625
dish out Mongolian beef
with snow peas?

1129
01:07:08,692 --> 01:07:11,719
Well, life's hard.
Turns out they can't come.

1130
01:07:11,795 --> 01:07:13,286
It's for her kid, man.

1131
01:07:14,632 --> 01:07:17,124

with my problems?

got some cracked ribs,
that's gotta sting.

around too much in here.

Oh, I'm sorry.
Is that uncomfortable?

1140
01:07:40,958 --> 01:07:42,187
Douche bag.

1141
01:07:42,259 --> 01:07:44,228
I don't really care much
for that term "douche bag."

1142
01:07:44,295 --> 01:07:47,265

like crazy these days,
like it's suddenly okay.

You know what else
people say now? "Suck it."

I was watching TV
the other night, 8:30,
middle of prime time.

I'm gonna ask you
some questions.

1149
01:08:02,046 --> 01:08:04,982

one-word answers,

yes or no.

be able to handle that.

1162
01:08:56,467 --> 01:08:57,958

Yeah. Yeah,
and you're outta time.

01:09:01,805 --> 01:09:03,000
You might have these
assholes in the bag,

1166
01:09:03,073 --> 01:09:05,440
but you can't lean on me
like this when we get
to the hospital.

1167

I was chasing him?

in any trouble at all.

1195

I have reason
to believe somebody

1196
01:11:55,779 --> 01:11:58,180
may have
put something in there
without your knowledge.

looking for all damn day.
