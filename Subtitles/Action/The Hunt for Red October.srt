00:16:03,196 --> 00:16:04,993
I keep it
for sentimental value.

187
00:16:05,231 --> 00:16:06,994
I'm sorry, comrade Captain.

188
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,963
Your wife was...
a beautiful woman.

189
00:16:09,202 --> 00:16:11,193
Her death was... unfortunate.

190
00:16:11,271 --> 00:16:13,205
I'm only doing my job.

191
00:16:13,273 --> 00:16:14,763
It is my responsibility.

192
00:16:17,677 --> 00:16:21,511
How many agents did the KGB
put aboard my boat?

193
00:16:21,581 --> 00:16:22,980
Your boat, Captain?

194
00:16:23,016 --> 00:16:24,415
Yes.

195
00:16:24,484 --> 00:16:27,783
This vessel belongs to
the people of the Soviet Union.

196
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:32,280
Besides, if the KGB or the GRU
has agents aboard,

197
00:16:32,358 --> 00:16:35,384
I will be the last to know.

198
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:40,227
I suggest we open
our orders, Captain.

199
00:16:41,601 --> 00:16:43,262
Certainly, comrade.

200
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:27,774
"From commander...

201
00:17:27,847 --> 00:17:29,508
strategic submarine forces

202
00:17:29,582 --> 00:17:31,573
red banner northern fleet."

203
00:17:31,651 --> 00:17:36,918
We're to proceed north
to grid square reference 54-90

204
00:17:36,989 --> 00:17:40,857
and rendezvous with
alfa submarine Konovalov.

205
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:42,758
Captain Tupolev's boat.

206
00:17:42,829 --> 00:17:44,387
You know Tupolev?

207
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:46,796
I know he descends
from aristocracy

208
00:17:46,866 --> 00:17:49,960
and that he was your student.

209
00:17:50,036 --> 00:17:51,901
It's rumored he has
a special place

210
00:17:51,971 --> 00:17:53,461
in his heart for you.

211
00:17:53,539 --> 00:17:57,339
There's little room in Tupolev's heart
for anyone but Tupolev.

212
00:18:01,447 --> 00:18:04,939
Having made contact,
we are to run a series of drills.

213
00:18:05,017 --> 00:18:08,009
Tupolev will hunt us
while we test our ship.

214
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:09,611
Having evaluated
the operational readiness

215
00:18:09,689 --> 00:18:11,054
of the caterpillar drive,

216
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:13,058
we are to return to Polijarny

217
00:18:13,126 --> 00:18:15,720
on or about the 16th
of this month.

218
00:18:17,130 --> 00:18:19,690
Captain, this is
an historic moment.

219
00:18:19,766 --> 00:18:21,666
I'd like to make a request.

220
00:18:21,734 --> 00:18:23,133
Before you proceed, comrade...

221
00:18:23,336 --> 00:18:24,803
I know it's not protocol,

222
00:18:24,871 --> 00:18:26,930
but would you permit me
to post our orders

223
00:18:27,006 --> 00:18:29,668
and inform the crew
of our mission?

224
00:18:35,715 --> 00:18:36,773
Aah!

225
00:18:54,667 --> 00:18:56,362
Where I'm going...

226
00:18:56,436 --> 00:18:58,529
you cannot follow.

227
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:30,931
Dr. Petrov, report
to my cabin immediately.

228
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:33,028
There's been
a dreadful accident.

229
00:20:03,236 --> 00:20:04,464
Hey, buddy!

230
00:20:13,646 --> 00:20:15,841
Daniel, got any more rods?

231
00:20:15,915 --> 00:20:17,007
More rods!

232
00:20:17,083 --> 00:20:19,813
Listen to me.
There's no cradle underneath it.

233
00:20:19,886 --> 00:20:21,217
Get it over.

234
00:20:21,254 --> 00:20:23,222
Relax!
Stop being an old maid.

235
00:20:23,256 --> 00:20:26,225
You want to come up here
and do it yourself?

236
00:20:26,259 --> 00:20:27,783
All right. Bring her up.

237
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:28,918
What? What?

238
00:20:30,162 --> 00:20:31,527
Ryan!

239
00:20:31,597 --> 00:20:32,928
Who let you in here?

240
00:20:32,999 --> 00:20:34,125
Hey, Skip,

241
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:37,101
what, have they got you
playing with models now?

242
00:20:37,136 --> 00:20:38,535
Ahh!

243
00:20:38,571 --> 00:20:39,902
Damn it, Bill!

244
00:20:39,972 --> 00:20:41,963
Tell them to slow down!

245
00:20:42,041 --> 00:20:43,975
I'm doing it.
I'm doing it.

246
00:20:44,043 --> 00:20:45,567
Calm down, will you?

247
00:20:45,611 --> 00:20:48,512
It's not a model. The DSRV.

248
00:20:48,581 --> 00:20:49,548
Rescue sub.

249
00:20:49,582 --> 00:20:50,947
I know what it is.

250
00:20:51,017 --> 00:20:53,110
What are you doing with it?

251
00:20:53,185 --> 00:20:55,710
We're rigging it
with a generic docking collar

252
00:20:55,788 --> 00:20:57,722
so it'll mate with
British, German...

253
00:20:57,757 --> 00:20:59,054
just about anybody's sub.

254
00:20:59,091 --> 00:21:01,559
We can get it
anywhere in the world

255
00:21:01,627 --> 00:21:02,924
in 24 hours.

256
00:21:04,230 --> 00:21:05,788
How's your back?

257
00:21:05,865 --> 00:21:07,856
It's fine.

258
00:21:07,934 --> 00:21:10,494
Have you got a minute?

259
00:21:11,804 --> 00:21:14,136
Bigger than
a regular typhoon.

260
00:21:15,207 --> 00:21:16,765
What are these doors?

261
00:21:16,809 --> 00:21:19,141
You don't miss much, do you?

262
00:21:19,211 --> 00:21:22,271
Those are too big
to be torpedo tubes.

263
00:21:23,849 --> 00:21:26,010
Would you launch
an ICBM horizontally?

264
00:21:26,085 --> 00:21:28,053
Sure. Why would you want to?

265
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:30,247
They're symmetrical.

266
00:21:31,324 --> 00:21:33,918
Right down
the long axis of the sub.

267
00:21:33,993 --> 00:21:36,757
How about a towed sonar array?

268
00:21:36,829 --> 00:21:39,297
Nope.
Too close to the screws.

269
00:21:39,532 --> 00:21:40,726
I'll be...

270
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:44,234
This...

271
00:21:44,303 --> 00:21:45,827
This could be a caterpillar.

272
00:21:45,905 --> 00:21:46,894
A what?

273
00:21:46,973 --> 00:21:48,668
Uh, a caterpillar drive.

274
00:21:48,741 --> 00:21:51,073
Magneto-hydrodynamic propulsion.

275
00:21:51,143 --> 00:21:52,542
You follow?

276
00:21:52,612 --> 00:21:53,636
No.

277
00:21:53,713 --> 00:21:57,046
It's like a...
a jet engine for the water.

278
00:21:57,116 --> 00:21:59,209
Goes in the front,
gets squirted out the back.

279
00:21:59,285 --> 00:22:01,219
Only it's got no moving parts,

280
00:22:01,287 --> 00:22:03,187
so it's very, very quiet.

281
00:22:03,255 --> 00:22:05,655
Like how quiet?

282
00:22:05,691 --> 00:22:08,660
It's doubtful our sonar
would even pick it up.

283
00:22:08,728 --> 00:22:10,059
And if it did,

284
00:22:10,129 --> 00:22:12,063
it would sound
like whales humping

285
00:22:12,131 --> 00:22:13,689
or a seismic anomaly.

286
00:22:13,733 --> 00:22:15,098
Anything but a submarine.

287
00:22:15,167 --> 00:22:18,295
We messed with this
a couple of years ago.

288
00:22:18,337 --> 00:22:20,100
Couldn't make it work.

289
00:22:21,073 --> 00:22:22,631
They really built this?

290
00:22:22,708 --> 00:22:25,199
This isn't a mock-up
or anything?

291
00:22:25,277 --> 00:22:27,768
She put to sea this morning.

292
00:22:33,386 --> 00:22:34,876
When I was 12,

293
00:22:34,954 --> 00:22:38,321
I helped my daddy build
a bomb shelter in our basement

294
00:22:38,357 --> 00:22:40,882
because some fool parked
a dozen warheads

295
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:44,361
90 miles off the
coast of Florida.

296
00:22:44,597 --> 00:22:47,361
This thing could park
a couple of hundred warheads

297
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:48,965
off Washington and New York,

298
00:22:49,035 --> 00:22:51,367
and no one would know
anything about it

299
00:22:51,604 --> 00:22:53,231
until it was all over.

300
00:23:04,850 --> 00:23:07,250
Are you all right, Captain?

301
00:23:07,319 --> 00:23:08,650
Oh, yes.

302
00:23:08,721 --> 00:23:11,053
It's just to die for something

303
00:23:11,123 --> 00:23:13,353
as petty as slipping on tea.

304
00:23:13,426 --> 00:23:15,917
You're blaming yourself, Captain.
It was an accident.

305
00:23:15,995 --> 00:23:18,361
You'll feel better
when we put in.

306
00:23:18,397 --> 00:23:19,421
Put in?

307
00:23:19,665 --> 00:23:21,189
Well, to base, Captain.

308
00:23:21,267 --> 00:23:23,792
We cannot go on without
a political officer.

309
00:23:23,869 --> 00:23:27,236
Doctor, this is a combat vessel
of the Soviet Navy,

310
00:23:27,273 --> 00:23:29,798
and I'm a senior combat officer.

311
00:23:29,875 --> 00:23:33,174
We do not cancel operations
because of accidents.

312
00:23:34,847 --> 00:23:36,041
Seaman.

313
00:23:36,115 --> 00:23:38,310
Come here.

314
00:23:38,384 --> 00:23:40,978
Come here.

315
00:23:41,053 --> 00:23:42,714
Your name?

316
00:23:42,788 --> 00:23:44,415
Cook's Assistant, Loginov, sir.

317
00:23:44,457 --> 00:23:49,190
Good. I want you and the doctor
to witness this.

318
00:23:49,261 --> 00:23:51,320
I'm removing
the political officer's...

319
00:23:51,397 --> 00:23:52,796
missile key...

320
00:23:52,865 --> 00:23:54,093
carry on...

321
00:23:54,133 --> 00:23:56,192
and I'm keeping it myself.

322
00:23:56,268 --> 00:23:58,236
Captain, I think
we should report this

323
00:23:58,270 --> 00:24:00,170
to Red Fleet Command.

324
00:24:00,239 --> 00:24:01,399
I'm afraid
that's impossible, Doctor.

325
00:24:01,474 --> 00:24:03,999
Our orders are
for strict radio silence.

326
00:24:04,076 --> 00:24:05,668
Orders, sir.

327
00:24:05,745 --> 00:24:07,076
That's all, Loginov.

328
00:24:07,146 --> 00:24:08,078
Yes, sir.

329
00:24:08,114 --> 00:24:11,311
This is most unnerving,
Captain.

330
00:24:11,383 --> 00:24:14,910
The reason for having
two missile keys

331
00:24:14,987 --> 00:24:18,115
is so that no one man...

332
00:24:18,190 --> 00:24:19,179
may...

333
00:24:19,258 --> 00:24:21,453
May what?

334
00:24:22,828 --> 00:24:24,420
May arm the missiles.

335
00:24:24,497 --> 00:24:26,431
Perhaps I should keep the key.

336
00:24:26,499 --> 00:24:28,467
Thank you.
That'll be all, Doctor.

337
00:24:28,501 --> 00:24:29,468
Captain, l...

338
00:24:29,502 --> 00:24:31,265
When I address the crew,

339
00:24:31,303 --> 00:24:33,828
then you will understand.

340
00:24:33,906 --> 00:24:35,100
Yes, sir.

341
00:24:37,777 --> 00:24:38,937
Petrov.

342
00:24:38,978 --> 00:24:40,070
Yes, sir?

343
00:24:40,146 --> 00:24:42,512
I will try to forget
your comments

344
00:24:42,748 --> 00:24:45,182
when I present my report.

345
00:24:45,251 --> 00:24:46,912
Thank you, sir.

346
00:24:52,258 --> 00:24:56,388
Holding steady on 3-1-0.

347
00:24:56,462 --> 00:24:58,396
12 knots
at about 20,000 yards.

348
00:24:58,464 --> 00:25:00,955
Have you got a make on him?

349
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,399
Computer's chewing on it, sir.

350
00:25:02,468 --> 00:25:03,492
Twin screws.

351
00:25:03,736 --> 00:25:06,296
The plant noise
sounds like a typhoon.

352
00:25:06,372 --> 00:25:08,397
[Computer Printer]

353
00:25:15,347 --> 00:25:18,077
I'd say we got
a new boat, sir.

354
00:25:18,150 --> 00:25:20,983
Tommy, I miss something
on the boards?

355
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:23,011
Sub plant hasn't said
anything about it.

356
00:25:23,055 --> 00:25:24,113
Hmm.

357
00:25:26,091 --> 00:25:27,115
All right.

358
00:25:27,193 --> 00:25:29,525
How many typhoons
we got in the computer?

359
00:25:29,562 --> 00:25:30,529
Six, sir.

360
00:25:30,563 --> 00:25:32,554
OK. Call this guy
Typhoon Seven.

361
00:25:32,765 --> 00:25:34,096
Start a tape on him.

362
00:25:34,166 --> 00:25:36,532
See if we can work
in a little closer.

363
00:25:36,569 --> 00:25:38,434
Yes, sir.

364
00:25:38,504 --> 00:25:40,028
Won't he hear us?

365
00:25:40,072 --> 00:25:43,064
Not if we stay in his baffles,
Seaman Beaumont.

366
00:25:43,142 --> 00:25:45,542
Not if we stay in his baffles.

367
00:25:45,578 --> 00:25:47,170

526
00:35:37,769 --> 00:35:39,703
We believe that these doors,

527
00:35:39,771 --> 00:35:42,706
here on the bow
and again on the stern,

528
00:35:42,774 --> 00:35:44,742

to run virtually silent.

that this new drive system

allowed the captain,
a man named Ramius,

from harbor this morning.

00:36:09,201 --> 00:36:10,725
It is also possible

538
00:36:10,802 --> 00:36:13,168
that this drive system,
if operable,

539
00:36:13,205 --> 00:36:15,173
could render the Red October

to approach by stealth

547
00:36:33,225 --> 00:36:34,749

independent warheads

before impact.

00:36:43,001 --> 00:36:45,902
About the same time
the Dallas lost contact,

552
00:36:45,971 --> 00:36:47,495
there were additional sailings

553
00:36:47,572 --> 00:36:50,598
from Polijarny and from
Leningrad on the Baltic

554
00:36:50,675 --> 00:36:52,472
and from the Mediterranean.

555
00:36:52,544 --> 00:36:55,069
There are now
some 58 nuclear submarines

556
00:36:55,146 --> 00:36:57,774
headed at high speed
into the Atlantic.

557
00:36:57,849 --> 00:37:00,545
This afternoon a satellite pass
over Polijarny

558
00:37:00,619 --> 00:37:03,053
found heat blooms
in the engineering plants

559
00:37:03,121 --> 00:37:04,816
at the Kirov, the Minsk,

560
00:37:04,890 --> 00:37:07,222
and more than 20 other
cruisers and destroyers,

561
00:37:07,459 --> 00:37:09,654
indicating they were
preparing to sail.

562
00:37:09,728 --> 00:37:12,856
This constitutes the bulk
of the Soviet surface fleet.

563
00:37:12,898 --> 00:37:14,263
Admiral Greer,
your conclusions.

564
00:37:14,499 --> 00:37:15,727
Well, sir,

565
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:18,701
the data support
no conclusions as yet.

566
00:37:18,770 --> 00:37:21,637
The absence of activity
in the Pacific

567
00:37:21,706 --> 00:37:24,072
suggests this could
be just an exercise.

568
00:37:24,109 --> 00:37:26,077
It may have nothing to do...

569
00:37:26,144 --> 00:37:28,078
Suppose it's not an exercise?

570
00:37:28,146 --> 00:37:29,636
Suppose this
is the beginning

571
00:37:29,714 --> 00:37:31,079
of a move against NATO?

572
00:37:31,116 --> 00:37:33,084
NSA can speak for that,
Mr. Pelt.

573
00:37:33,118 --> 00:37:36,212
I must emphasize the extreme
sensitivity of this information

574
00:37:36,288 --> 00:37:38,813
and that it not leave the room.

575
00:37:38,890 --> 00:37:40,221
Before sailing, Captain Ramius

576
00:37:40,292 --> 00:37:42,954
sent a letter
to Admiral Yuri Padorin,

577
00:37:43,028 --> 00:37:44,586
Chairman of the Red Fleet

578
00:37:44,629 --> 00:37:46,256
northern political directorate.

579
00:37:46,298 --> 00:37:47,856
That's her uncle.

580
00:37:47,899 --> 00:37:49,696
Whose uncle?

581
00:37:49,768 --> 00:37:51,133
Ramius' wife.

582
00:37:51,202 --> 00:37:53,227
Padorin's her uncle.

583
00:37:53,305 --> 00:37:57,105
Now, the contents
of the letter are unknown,

584
00:37:57,175 --> 00:37:59,973
but Admiral Padorin
immediately demanded

585
00:38:00,045 --> 00:38:02,138
a meeting
with Premier Chernenko,

586
00:38:02,213 --> 00:38:04,704
and within minutes
of that meeting,

587
00:38:04,783 --> 00:38:06,114
the Soviet fleet sailed

588
00:38:06,151 --> 00:38:08,711
with orders
to find Red October

589
00:38:08,753 --> 00:38:10,243
and sink her.

590
00:38:11,623 --> 00:38:12,715
Sink her?

591
00:38:12,791 --> 00:38:15,123
My God. They've got
a madman on their hands.

592
00:38:15,193 --> 00:38:17,991
If it gets within
500 miles of the coast,

593
00:38:18,063 --> 00:38:20,998
we'll have less than
two minutes' warning.

594
00:38:36,014 --> 00:38:37,743
Today's the 23rd, isn't it?

595
00:38:37,816 --> 00:38:38,783
What?

596
00:38:38,850 --> 00:38:39,908
Is today the 23rd?

597
00:38:39,985 --> 00:38:40,917
Yeah.

598
00:38:51,730 --> 00:38:53,960
You son of a bitch.

599
00:38:55,100 --> 00:38:58,035
You son of a bitch!

600
00:39:00,972 --> 00:39:02,803
You wish to add something

601
00:39:02,874 --> 00:39:04,603
to our discussion, Dr. Ryan?

602
00:39:09,981 --> 00:39:12,040
Well, sir,
I was just thinking

603
00:39:12,117 --> 00:39:15,177
that perhaps there's another
possibility we might consider.

604
00:39:16,888 --> 00:39:19,083
Ramius might be
trying to defect.

605
00:39:19,157 --> 00:39:20,249
Do you mean to suggest

606
00:39:20,325 --> 00:39:21,849
that this man has come...

607
00:39:21,926 --> 00:39:23,757
Proceed, Mr. Ryan.

608
00:39:26,731 --> 00:39:27,959
Well...

609
00:39:27,999 --> 00:39:30,661
Ramius trained most
of their officer corps,

610
00:39:30,735 --> 00:39:33,101
which would put him
in a position

611
00:39:33,171 --> 00:39:36,106
to select men
willing to help him.

612
00:39:36,174 --> 00:39:37,801
And he's not Russian.

613
00:39:38,843 --> 00:39:40,242
He's Lithuanian by birth,

614
00:39:40,311 --> 00:39:43,246
raised by his paternal
grandfather, a fisherman.

615
00:39:43,314 --> 00:39:47,375
And he has no children,
no ties to leave behind.

616
00:39:50,188 --> 00:39:52,952
And today is
the first anniversary

617
00:39:53,024 --> 00:39:54,355
of his wife's death.

618
00:39:54,392 --> 00:39:56,360
Come on.
You're just an analyst.

619
00:39:56,428 --> 00:39:58,726
How can you read his mind?

620
00:39:58,797 --> 00:40:00,287
I know Ramius, General.

621
00:40:00,365 --> 00:40:03,334
He's nearly a legend
in the submarine community.

622
00:40:03,401 --> 00:40:05,733
He's been a maverick
his entire career.

623
00:40:05,804 --> 00:40:08,432
I actually met him once
at an embassy dinner.

624
00:40:08,673 --> 00:40:11,141
Have you ever met
Captain Ramius, General?

625
00:40:19,984 --> 00:40:21,315
Admiral Hollis,

626
00:40:21,386 --> 00:40:24,913
how long before Ramius
could be in a position

627
00:40:24,989 --> 00:40:27,355
to fire his missiles at us?

628
00:40:27,392 --> 00:40:28,757
Four days.

629
00:40:28,827 --> 00:40:31,193
All right.
I'll brief the President.

630
00:40:31,262 --> 00:40:33,389
That will be all, gentlemen.

631
00:40:33,465 --> 00:40:34,932
Dr. Ryan,

632
00:40:34,966 --> 00:40:38,458
would you stay
for a moment, please?

633
00:40:38,703 --> 00:40:41,763
I said speak your mind,
Jack, but Jesus...

634
00:40:53,752 --> 00:40:57,381
You slammed the door
on the general pretty hard, Jack.

635
00:40:57,422 --> 00:40:59,947
That was not my intention, sir.

636
00:41:00,024 --> 00:41:01,389
Oh, yes, it was.

637
00:41:01,459 --> 00:41:02,949
He was patronizing you,

638
00:41:02,994 --> 00:41:04,962
and you stomped on him.

639
00:41:04,996 --> 00:41:07,362
In my opinion,
he deserved it.

640
00:41:07,432 --> 00:41:09,491
Listen, I'm a politician,

641
00:41:09,734 --> 00:41:12,100
which means I'm
a cheat and a liar,

642
00:41:12,137 --> 00:41:14,264
and when I'm
not kissing babies,

643
00:41:14,305 --> 00:41:15,932
I'm stealing
their lollipops,

644
00:41:16,007 --> 00:41:21,172
but it also means
that I keep my options open.

645
00:41:21,246 --> 00:41:27,412
So let's assume for a minute
that you're right

646
00:41:27,452 --> 00:41:30,114
and this Russian
intends to defect.

647
00:41:31,156 --> 00:41:33,852
What do you suggest
we do about it?

648
00:41:35,727 --> 00:41:37,490
We definitely
grab the boat, sir.

649
00:41:37,729 --> 00:41:39,788
Hey, wait a minute.

650
00:41:39,864 --> 00:41:43,163
We're not talking about
some stray pilot with a M.I.G.

651
00:41:43,234 --> 00:41:45,759
We're talking about several
billion dollars' worth

652
00:41:45,837 --> 00:41:47,168
of Soviet state property.

653
00:41:47,238 --> 00:41:49,172
They're going to want it back.

654
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:50,730
Maybe it's enough then

655
00:41:50,809 --> 00:41:53,778
just to get some people
onboard and inspect it.

656
00:41:53,845 --> 00:41:55,779
Call it whatever
you want to...

657
00:41:55,847 --> 00:41:57,815
a Coast Guard
safety inspection.

658
00:41:57,849 --> 00:42:00,477
So how do we proceed?

659
00:42:00,518 --> 00:42:02,008
First, we need to contact

660
00:42:02,086 --> 00:42:05,021
the commanders
in the Atlantic directly.

661
00:42:05,089 --> 00:42:07,023
The Russians get
one whiff of this

662
00:42:07,091 --> 00:42:08,786
through the regular
communications circuits,

663
00:42:08,827 --> 00:42:10,192
the game is up.

664
00:42:10,261 --> 00:42:13,196
Second, we figure out
how we can help them.

665
00:42:13,264 --> 00:42:15,198
We devise a plan to intercede,

666
00:42:15,266 --> 00:42:17,791
ready to go at a moment's notice.

667
00:42:17,836 --> 00:42:20,828
Third, somebody's got to
go make contact with Ramius

668
00:42:20,905 --> 00:42:23,533
and find out what
his intentions really are.

669
00:42:23,775 --> 00:42:24,969
OK.

670
00:42:25,043 --> 00:42:26,374
When do you leave?

671
00:42:26,411 --> 00:42:27,969
Ha ha ha!

672
00:42:28,012 --> 00:42:30,071
Wait a minute.

673
00:42:31,316 --> 00:42:32,840
The general was right.

674
00:42:32,884 --> 00:42:34,215
I am not field personnel.

675
00:42:34,285 --> 00:42:35,809
I am only an analyst.

676
00:42:35,887 --> 00:42:36,945
You're perfect.

677
00:42:37,021 --> 00:42:39,854
I can't ask any
of these characters to go.

678
00:42:39,891 --> 00:42:41,256
They don't believe in it.

679
00:42:41,326 --> 00:42:42,953
They'd never stake
their reputation

680
00:42:43,027 --> 00:42:44,392
on a hunch, whereas you...

681
00:42:44,429 --> 00:42:45,953
Are expendable.

682
00:42:48,333 --> 00:42:49,960
Something like that.

683
00:42:53,304 --> 00:42:55,272
I'll give you three days

684
00:42:55,340 --> 00:42:57,240
to prove your theory correct.

685
00:42:57,308 --> 00:42:58,832
After that,

686
00:42:58,877 --> 00:43:02,244
I have to hunt down Ramius
and destroy him.

687
00:43:02,313 --> 00:43:04,247
Will you do it?

688
00:43:20,632 --> 00:43:22,600
Mother of God!

689
00:43:22,834 --> 00:43:24,301
Secure the mast!

690
00:43:24,369 --> 00:43:25,893
All ahead, 2/3!

691
00:43:25,937 --> 00:43:27,302
Set depth to 900 meters!

692
00:43:27,372 --> 00:43:29,306
What is it?
What's happened?

693
00:43:29,374 --> 00:43:31,399
Mast secured, helm at 2/3.

694
00:43:33,111 --> 00:43:35,443
Commence heading 2-0-5.

695
00:43:35,480 --> 00:43:38,005
2-0-5, affirmative.

696
00:43:51,296 --> 00:43:54,163
These orders
are seven bloody hours old!

697
00:43:54,232 --> 00:43:55,631
Sitting on the bottom

698
00:43:55,667 --> 00:43:57,157
like an addled schoolboy.

699
00:43:57,235 --> 00:43:58,202
Captain...

700
00:43:58,269 --> 00:43:59,201
Passing at...

701
00:43:59,270 --> 00:44:00,294
All ahead, flank.

702
00:44:00,371 --> 00:44:01,429
All ahead, flank.

703
00:44:01,506 --> 00:44:03,599
Inquire of the engineer
about the possibility

704
00:44:03,641 --> 00:44:06,405
of going to 105%
on the reactor.

705
00:44:07,378 --> 00:44:09,312
Seven hours.

706
00:44:09,380 --> 00:44:12,042
The entire fleet is after him.

707
00:44:21,092 --> 00:44:22,491
Leveling at 900 meters.

708
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:23,618
Very well.

709
00:44:23,695 --> 00:44:25,629
Captain, Engineer reports

710
00:44:25,663 --> 00:44:28,223
105% on the reactor
possible,

711
00:44:28,299 --> 00:44:29,926
but not recommended.

712
00:44:40,678 --> 00:44:43,374
Go to 105 on the reactor.

713
00:44:46,317 --> 00:44:47,648
Captain, what is it?

714
00:44:47,685 --> 00:44:49,209
Where are we going?

715
00:44:49,287 --> 00:44:51,949
We're going to
kill a friend, Yevgeni.

716
00:44:52,690 --> 00:44:55,386
We're going to kill Ramius.

717
00:45:17,148 --> 00:45:18,513
If you like borscht,
perhaps,

718
00:45:18,549 --> 00:45:21,040
but I've eaten better
in an oiler's galley.

719
00:45:21,119 --> 00:45:23,019
My wife said to the waiter,

720
00:45:23,054 --> 00:45:25,454
"Where did this man
learn to cook,

721
00:45:25,523 --> 00:45:26,490
Afghanistan?"

722
00:45:26,557 --> 00:45:29,355
So then we went
on to the Bolshoi,

723
00:45:29,394 --> 00:45:30,554
the ballet,

724
00:45:30,628 --> 00:45:32,960
to see this new girl
as Giselle.

725
00:45:33,031 --> 00:45:34,498
You remember
how beautiful she was.

726
00:45:34,565 --> 00:45:36,499
She just married
a factory manager.

727
00:45:36,567 --> 00:45:38,034
Excuse me, Doctor.

728
00:45:38,102 --> 00:45:40,036
Do you have the figures

729
00:45:40,104 --> 00:45:43,073
for the latest batch
of radiation tests?

730
00:45:43,141 --> 00:45:44,199
Now?

731
00:45:45,143 --> 00:45:46,474
Now.

732
00:45:48,112 --> 00:45:51,604
Perhaps you could bring
the preceding set as well...

733
00:45:52,550 --> 00:45:54,074
for comparison.

734
00:45:55,153 --> 00:45:56,620
Thank you, Doctor.

735
00:46:14,605 --> 00:46:17,233
It will take him some time.

736
00:46:18,276 --> 00:46:20,801
Before we begin, Captain,

737
00:46:21,045 --> 00:46:22,376
I'd like to know

738
00:46:22,447 --> 00:46:24,278
exactly what happened
to Putin.

739
00:46:29,420 --> 00:46:32,412
He didn't slip
on his tea, did he?

740
00:46:33,624 --> 00:46:36,115
I don't think I like
your tone, Slavin.

741
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:39,527
What the hell's my tone
got to do with it?

742
00:46:39,597 --> 00:46:41,087
We're risking our lives here.

743
00:46:41,165 --> 00:46:43,531
Putin could've caused
complications.

744
00:46:43,601 --> 00:46:46,126
Did you think he would
just go away and sulk

745
00:46:46,204 --> 00:46:48,138
while we carried out our plans?

746
00:46:48,206 --> 00:46:50,401
Are you saying
he was murdered?

747
00:46:50,475 --> 00:46:52,102
My God.

748
00:46:52,176 --> 00:46:53,541
Stop whining, Yuri.

749
00:46:53,611 --> 00:46:55,135
How can you justify murder?

750
00:46:55,179 --> 00:46:56,578
So he was murdered.

751
00:46:56,647 --> 00:46:58,740
The man was a pig,

752
00:46:58,783 --> 00:47:01,616
but it's a decision
we should've all made together.

753
00:47:01,652 --> 00:47:03,176
You are not in command here.

754
00:47:03,254 --> 00:47:06,155
If the crew finds out,
we could have a mutiny.

755
00:47:06,190 --> 00:47:07,623
What are you talking about?

756
00:47:07,692 --> 00:47:09,182
They could kill us all.

757
00:47:09,260 --> 00:47:12,229
Everything that happens
on this ship affects us all.

758
00:47:12,296 --> 00:47:14,628
The Master-At-Arms
is already suspicious.

759
00:47:14,665 --> 00:47:16,189
We could still go back.

760
00:47:16,267 --> 00:47:18,428
There will be no going back.

761
00:47:20,538 --> 00:47:21,869
Before we sailed,

762
00:47:22,106 --> 00:47:26,338
I dispatched a letter
to Admiral Padorin,

763
00:47:26,377 --> 00:47:28,845
in which I announced
our intention...

764
00:47:29,080 --> 00:47:30,547
to defect.

765
00:47:32,183 --> 00:47:35,152
In the name of God, why?

766
00:47:35,186 --> 00:47:37,552
When he reached the New World,

767
00:47:37,622 --> 00:47:40,147
Cortez burned his ships.

768
00:47:40,191 --> 00:47:43,649
As a result, his men
were well motivated.

769
00:47:43,728 --> 00:47:46,561
You have signed
our death warrants.

770
00:47:46,631 --> 00:47:49,600
Padorin will send
the entire fleet.

771
00:47:49,667 --> 00:47:51,157
Jesus, they'll find us.

772
00:47:51,202 --> 00:47:52,464
They'll find us and...

773
00:47:52,537 --> 00:47:54,334
No one's going to find us.

774
00:47:54,372 --> 00:47:55,839
That's enough, Yuri.

775
00:47:57,241 --> 00:47:58,765
You had to do it, huh?

776
00:47:58,843 --> 00:48:01,778
You couldn't just
turn the submarine over

777
00:48:01,846 --> 00:48:03,370
to the Americans.

778
00:48:03,414 --> 00:48:06,383
You had to make
a political statement.

779
00:48:06,417 --> 00:48:09,853
Or was it something
deeper, Captain...

780
00:48:09,921 --> 00:48:13,755
something that made you
unable to slip away?

781
00:48:13,824 --> 00:48:16,622
Was it ego, Captain?

782
00:48:16,694 --> 00:48:19,629
We each have
our reasons, Victor.

783
00:48:19,697 --> 00:48:21,187
My own began

784
00:48:21,232 --> 00:48:25,191
the day I was handed
the blueprints for this ship...

785
00:48:25,269 --> 00:48:28,204
a ship which had but one use.

786
00:48:28,272 --> 00:48:30,206
And as for the rest,

787
00:48:30,241 --> 00:48:33,210
well, those are things
that I alone

788
00:48:33,244 --> 00:48:35,212
must carry the burden for.

789
00:48:35,246 --> 00:48:39,649
Anatoli,
you're afraid of our fleet.

790
00:48:39,717 --> 00:48:41,582
Well, you should be.

791
00:48:41,652 --> 00:48:45,918
Personally, I give us
one chance in three.

792
00:48:49,694 --> 00:48:51,787
More tea, anyone?

793
00:48:54,799 --> 00:48:56,562
No?

794
00:48:57,702 --> 00:49:00,899
Then you may report
back to your posts.

795
00:49:17,755 --> 00:49:20,519
You heard the Captain.
Dismissed.

796
00:49:29,767 --> 00:49:31,496
Captain.

797
00:49:43,314 --> 00:49:45,714
Captain, I would never
disagree with you

798
00:49:45,783 --> 00:49:48,684
in front of the men,
you know that.

799
00:49:48,753 --> 00:49:52,280
But in this case,
Victor is right.

800
00:49:53,024 --> 00:49:54,582
It would've been better

801
00:49:54,659 --> 00:49:56,991
if you had not informed Moscow.

802
00:49:57,028 --> 00:49:58,325
Oh, Vasily.

803
00:49:58,396 --> 00:50:00,887
Moscow is not the worry,

804
00:50:00,965 --> 00:50:03,593
nor the whole Soviet Navy.

805
00:50:03,668 --> 00:50:06,000
I know their tactics.

806
00:50:06,237 --> 00:50:08,467
I have the advantage.

00:50:10,241 --> 00:50:11,469
No.

808
00:50:12,376 --> 00:50:14,867
The worry is the Americans.

If we meet the right sort,

810
00:50:18,983 --> 00:50:21,315
this will work.

eh, Commander?

Oh! You talk about puke!

818
00:50:43,374 --> 00:50:46,343
We ran into a hailstorm
over the sea of Japan, right?

Everybody's retching
their guts out!

that lightweight stuff either!

you get a bright idea,

Sir, the moment
that sub went silent

855
00:52:10,761 --> 00:52:13,093
and I thought I
heard some singing,

856
00:52:13,130 --> 00:52:15,690
I heard something
in the background real faint.

00:52:15,766 --> 00:52:17,700
After all those subs took off,

858
00:52:17,768 --> 00:52:21,135

and got it on tape.

00:54:57,761 --> 00:54:59,228
I'll bag him.

913
00:55:00,297 --> 00:55:01,559
Carry on.

914
00:55:01,632 --> 00:55:02,792
Yes, sir.

915
00:55:04,301 --> 00:55:06,599
That's the craziest notion
I've ever heard...

916
00:55:06,637 --> 00:55:07,729
a serving line officer?

917
00:55:07,771 --> 00:55:09,739
An entire ballistic
missile submarine?

918
00:55:09,773 --> 00:55:11,172
They can't all want to defect.

919
00:55:11,241 --> 00:55:13,141
Even if it's only the officers,

920
00:55:13,210 --> 00:55:14,768
it's extremely
difficult to believe.

921
00:55:14,812 --> 00:55:16,143
What's his plan?

922
00:55:16,213 --> 00:55:17,544
His plan?

923
00:55:17,615 --> 00:55:19,947
Russians don't take a dump, son,

924
00:55:20,017 --> 00:55:21,917
without a plan.

925
00:55:21,986 --> 00:55:24,784
Senior captains don't start
something this dangerous

926
00:55:24,822 --> 00:55:26,585
without having thought
the matter through.

927
00:55:26,657 --> 00:55:27,715
What's he going to do,

928
00:55:27,791 --> 00:55:30,885
sail into New York, pop the hatch,
and say here I am?

929
00:55:30,961 --> 00:55:32,929
It might be just
that simple, yes.

930
00:55:32,997 --> 00:55:35,124
Things may appear simple
in the cubicle at CIA,

931
00:55:35,165 --> 00:55:37,565
but in the middle
of the Atlantic

932
00:55:37,635 --> 00:55:39,933
with Soviet warships
bearing down on us,

933
00:55:39,970 --> 00:55:41,267
they get more complex.

934
00:55:41,338 --> 00:55:42,305
Smoke?

935
00:55:42,339 --> 00:55:44,603
No, thank you.

936
00:55:44,675 --> 00:55:46,336
And I don't think your notion

937
00:55:46,377 --> 00:55:48,902
of a few days inspection's
going to wash either.

938
00:55:48,979 --> 00:55:51,311
In order to be of any value,

939
00:55:51,382 --> 00:55:52,940
you'd have to tear it apart.

940
00:55:53,017 --> 00:55:54,644
The metallurgy would
take a couple of months.

941
00:55:54,718 --> 00:55:55,946
Then we'd have to keep it.

942
00:55:56,020 --> 00:55:59,353
What will you do with the crew?

943
00:55:59,590 --> 00:56:03,822
Ones that don't defect will go back
and say we got the boat.

944
00:56:03,861 --> 00:56:05,886
Or do you plan
to eliminate them?

945
00:56:07,097 --> 00:56:09,122
We're not at war, sir.

946
00:56:09,166 --> 00:56:13,262
So you have to get them
off the boat in such a way

947
00:56:13,337 --> 00:56:15,271
that they think we don't have it,

948
00:56:15,339 --> 00:56:18,900
and they'll report that
we don't have it to their bosses.

949
00:56:18,976 --> 00:56:20,273
Otherwise, this whole business

950
00:56:20,344 --> 00:56:22,278
is just academic, right?

951
00:56:23,914 --> 00:56:26,849
Yes, sir.
I think I see your point.

952
00:56:28,352 --> 00:56:30,752
When's the last time you slept?

953
00:56:32,956 --> 00:56:34,253
A while.

954
00:56:35,359 --> 00:56:37,987
The chief outside
will fix you up.

955
00:56:38,062 --> 00:56:39,620
Thank you, sir.

956
00:56:39,697 --> 00:56:41,096
Captain.

957
00:56:46,070 --> 00:56:48,402
It'll be dawn
in a couple of hours.

958
00:56:48,639 --> 00:56:49,936
We'll be in the CIC.

959
00:56:50,007 --> 00:56:53,204
Things are liable to get
a little dicey around here.

960
00:56:54,445 --> 00:56:56,106
Yes, sir.

961
00:57:03,821 --> 00:57:05,652
You think he's crazy?

962
00:57:05,723 --> 00:57:06,849
Certifiable.

963
00:57:06,924 --> 00:57:08,414
No matter what
his credentials,

964
00:57:08,659 --> 00:57:11,389
I don't care for him
wearing the uniform.

965
00:57:11,462 --> 00:57:13,930
Did you see that ring
on his finger?

966
00:57:13,997 --> 00:57:16,932
The academy, class of '72.
A marine.

967
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:18,058
You're kidding.

968
00:57:18,135 --> 00:57:19,693
How did you...

969
00:57:19,737 --> 00:57:21,068
Greer told me.

970
00:57:21,138 --> 00:57:22,867
Summer of his third year,

971
00:57:22,940 --> 00:57:25,272
he went down
in a chopper accident.

972
00:57:25,309 --> 00:57:27,277
Bad. Pilot and crew killed.

973
00:57:27,311 --> 00:57:30,246
That kid spent
10 months in traction

974
00:57:30,314 --> 00:57:33,283
and another year
learning to walk again.

975
00:57:33,350 --> 00:57:36,046
He did his fourth year
from the hospital.

976
00:57:37,054 --> 00:57:38,988
It's up to you, Charlie,

977
00:57:39,056 --> 00:57:42,890
but you might consider
cutting the kid a little slack.

978
00:57:42,960 --> 00:57:45,861
Ah, Russians are
going to find that sub

979
00:57:45,929 --> 00:57:48,397
before we get near it anyway.

980
00:58:10,354 --> 00:58:12,914
Passing Thor's Twins, sir.

981
00:58:12,990 --> 00:58:14,150
Very good.

982
00:58:19,129 --> 00:58:21,063
Passing the twins now,
Captain.

983
00:58:21,131 --> 00:58:23,031
Very good.
You may commence your run.

984
00:58:23,100 --> 00:58:25,034
Call me at the first turning.

985
00:58:25,102 --> 00:58:26,501
Aye, Captain.

986
00:58:26,537 --> 00:58:28,164
Mr. Kamarov.

987
00:58:29,239 --> 00:58:31,207
You may commence your run now.

988
00:58:31,275 --> 00:58:32,207
Aye, sir.

989
00:58:32,276 --> 00:58:35,803
First leg on my mark,
course 2-6-0.

990
00:58:35,879 --> 00:58:40,213
Speed, 18 knots.
Depth, 270 meters.

991
00:58:40,284 --> 00:58:41,842
5...

992
00:58:41,919 --> 00:58:42,886
4...

993
00:58:42,953 --> 00:58:43,942
3...

994
00:58:44,021 --> 00:58:44,953
2...

995
00:58:45,022 --> 00:58:46,319
1...

996
00:58:46,356 --> 00:58:47,914
Mark.

997
00:58:47,991 --> 00:58:50,357
Diving command, course 2-6-0.

998
00:58:50,427 --> 00:58:51,951
Course 2-6-0, aye.

999
00:58:52,029 --> 00:58:53,087
Speed, 18 knots.

1000
00:58:53,163 --> 00:58:54,528
Speed, 18 knots, aye.

1001
00:58:54,565 --> 00:58:56,089
Stop pissing, Yuri.

1002
00:58:56,166 --> 00:58:58,361
Give me a stopwatch and a map,

1003
00:58:58,435 --> 00:58:59,959
and I'll fly the Alps

1004
00:59:00,003 --> 00:59:01,368
in a plane with no windows.

1005
00:59:01,438 --> 00:59:04,100
If the map is accurate enough.

1006
00:59:25,162 --> 00:59:28,097
We're in the lane
and approaching first turn.

1007
00:59:28,165 --> 00:59:32,397
Come left to course 1-9-5.

1008
00:59:32,469 --> 00:59:34,403
In 30 seconds,

1009
00:59:34,471 --> 00:59:36,405
decrease depth to 200 meters.

1010
00:59:36,440 --> 00:59:37,998
Maintain speed.

1011
00:59:38,041 --> 00:59:39,508
Very good, Navigator.

1012
00:59:41,445 --> 00:59:44,005
Captain, we're approaching
the first turn.

1013
00:59:44,081 --> 00:59:46,413
25 seconds to course 1-9-5.

1014
00:59:46,450 --> 00:59:49,317
Increase speed to 26 knots
and recompute.

1015
00:59:52,456 --> 00:59:53,980
Aye, Captain.

1016
00:59:55,459 --> 00:59:58,519
Navigator, recompute
for 26 knots.

1017
01:00:00,063 --> 01:00:02,031
Turn on my mark.

1018
01:00:02,099 --> 01:00:07,401
5... 4... 3... 2... 1...

1019
01:00:07,471 --> 01:00:08,403
Mark.

1020
01:00:08,472 --> 01:00:10,406
Diving control,
come left to 1-9-5.

1021
01:00:10,474 --> 01:00:11,998
Come left to 1-9-5.

1022
01:00:12,075 --> 01:00:13,235
Up on the bow planes.

1023
01:00:21,151 --> 01:00:22,948
Course now 1-9-5

1024
01:00:23,020 --> 01:00:26,387
and maintaining speed
26 knots.

1025
01:00:30,327 --> 01:00:32,295
Mr. Kamarov?

1026
01:00:32,329 --> 01:00:34,263
Next leg, Captain,

1027
01:00:34,298 --> 01:00:38,667
come right
to course 2-4-0 now at...

1028
01:00:38,902 --> 01:00:40,870
8 minutes and 40 seconds.

1029
01:00:40,938 --> 01:00:43,964
Very good.
Maintain course and speed.

1030
01:00:47,344 --> 01:00:49,278
Too fast, Vasily.

1031
01:00:49,313 --> 01:00:50,280
Too fast.

1032
01:00:50,347 --> 01:00:53,282
Those charts are
laid out precisely...

1033
01:00:53,317 --> 01:00:56,286
so many knots
for so many seconds.

1034
01:00:56,320 --> 01:00:58,686
And this thing
handles like a pig.

1035
01:00:58,922 --> 01:01:01,288
Watch your bearing,
Mr. Slavin.

1036
01:01:07,531 --> 01:01:09,692
15 seconds to turn, Captain.

1037
01:01:09,933 --> 01:01:11,423
Should we decrease speed?

1038
01:01:11,501 --> 01:01:12,468
Negative.

1039
01:01:12,502 --> 01:01:14,993
Prepare to come right.

1040
01:01:15,038 --> 01:01:16,164
Aye, sir.

1041
01:01:16,239 --> 01:01:17,171
8...

1042
01:01:17,240 --> 01:01:18,264
7...

1043
01:01:18,308 --> 01:01:19,275
6...

1044
01:01:19,309 --> 01:01:20,298
5...

1045
01:01:20,377 --> 01:01:21,309
4...

1046
01:01:21,378 --> 01:01:22,310
3...

1047
01:01:22,379 --> 01:01:23,311
2...

1048
01:01:23,347 --> 01:01:24,712
1... Mark.

1049
01:01:24,948 --> 01:01:27,348
15 degrees down angle
on the bow planes.

1050
01:01:27,384 --> 01:01:29,579
Come right 2-4-0.

1051
01:01:29,653 --> 01:01:31,052
Move it!

1052
01:01:50,407 --> 01:01:51,704
We're in the lane.

1053
01:01:51,942 --> 01:01:55,036
Next leg 34 minutes
to the Neptune Massif.

1054
01:01:55,112 --> 01:01:58,047
Course 2-4-0.

1055
01:01:58,115 --> 01:02:00,049
[Boom]

1056
01:02:10,460 --> 01:02:11,757
What happened?

1057
01:02:12,729 --> 01:02:14,219
The cryogenic plant!

1058
01:02:14,264 --> 01:02:15,629
The magnets aren't cooling.

1059
01:02:15,699 --> 01:02:17,223
Temperature in
the caterpillar

1060
01:02:17,267 --> 01:02:20,202
is 15 degrees above red line
and rising.

1061
01:02:20,270 --> 01:02:21,635
It's going to melt.

1062
01:02:21,705 --> 01:02:24,071
Kill it! Shut it down!

1063
01:02:28,445 --> 01:02:29,969
Captain?

1064
01:02:30,047 --> 01:02:30,775
What happened?

1065
01:02:31,014 --> 01:02:32,777
The cryogenic plant failed.

1066
01:02:33,016 --> 01:02:35,211
Reactor damage?

1067
01:02:35,285 --> 01:02:36,775
There was a power spike,

1068
01:02:37,020 --> 01:02:38,681
but the reactor
scrammed automatically.

1069
01:02:38,722 --> 01:02:40,713
Was there any
radiation leakage?

1070
01:02:40,791 --> 01:02:42,349
I don't know yet!

1071
01:02:42,426 --> 01:02:44,519
How long will it take to fix?

1072
01:02:44,594 --> 01:02:46,789
I got to find
what's wrong first.

1073
01:02:47,030 --> 01:02:50,090
Could be the liquid helium
or the superconductors.

1074
01:02:51,334 --> 01:02:52,801
Captain, we will have to stop

1075
01:02:53,036 --> 01:02:55,402
until we can repair
the caterpillar unit.

1076
01:02:55,439 --> 01:02:58,101
Negative.
We'll run on normal propulsion.

1077
01:02:59,476 --> 01:03:01,808
Captain,
we will not be silent.

1078
01:03:02,045 --> 01:03:04,036
Make revolutions for 20 knots

1079
01:03:04,114 --> 01:03:07,106
and engage the propellers.

1080
01:03:10,454 --> 01:03:12,012
Aye, Captain.

1081
01:03:12,089 --> 01:03:13,556
Commence engine start-up.

1082
01:03:13,623 --> 01:03:15,818
He'll get us all killed.

1083
01:03:21,064 --> 01:03:23,555
The captain knows
what he's doing.

1084
01:03:24,468 --> 01:03:25,560
Doctor.

1085
01:03:28,605 --> 01:03:30,436
Naval activities?

1086
01:03:30,507 --> 01:03:32,702
I have no knowledge of this.

1087
01:03:32,742 --> 01:03:35,233
But then,
I never was a sailor.

1088
01:03:35,278 --> 01:03:37,075
Mr. Ambassador,

1089
01:03:37,114 --> 01:03:39,480
you have nearly
100 vessels operating

1090
01:03:39,549 --> 01:03:41,540
in the North Atlantic
right now.

1091
01:03:41,618 --> 01:03:43,677
Your aircraft have dropped
enough sonar buoys

1092
01:03:43,753 --> 01:03:47,120
that a man could walk
from Greenland to Scotland

1093
01:03:47,190 --> 01:03:48,817
without getting his feet wet.

1094
01:03:49,059 --> 01:03:50,754
Shall we dispense with the bull?

1095
01:03:50,827 --> 01:03:52,351
You make your point

1096
01:03:52,429 --> 01:03:56,559
as delicately as ever,
Mr. Pelt, but...

1097
01:03:56,633 --> 01:03:59,067
And what looks like an exercise

1098
01:03:59,102 --> 01:04:00,865
could be a prelude to war.

1099
01:04:01,104 --> 01:04:02,366
How can we tell the difference?

1100
01:04:02,439 --> 01:04:06,375
Prudence demands that we
deploy ships to observe yours.

1101
01:04:06,443 --> 01:04:07,842
Your government should consider

1102
01:04:08,078 --> 01:04:11,445
that having
your ships and ours,

1103
01:04:11,515 --> 01:04:13,449
your aircraft and ours,

1104
01:04:13,517 --> 01:04:17,886
in such proximity
is inherently dangerous.

1105
01:04:18,088 --> 01:04:21,717
Wars have begun that way,
Mr. Ambassador.

1106
01:04:30,433 --> 01:04:33,368
We have lost
one of our submarines.

1107
01:04:33,436 --> 01:04:34,368
Lost it?

1108
01:04:34,437 --> 01:04:37,372
We fear she may be down, and...

1109
01:04:37,440 --> 01:04:38,907
this is most embarrassing, but...

1110
01:04:39,109 --> 01:04:42,476
several of the officers
are sons of...

1111
01:04:42,546 --> 01:04:45,811
high party officials.

1112
01:04:45,882 --> 01:04:47,816
One is even the son

1113
01:04:47,884 --> 01:04:49,818
of a Central Committee member.

1114
01:04:49,886 --> 01:04:51,786
I cannot say which.

1115
01:04:51,821 --> 01:04:56,121
You're telling me this is
a massive rescue operation?

1116
01:04:56,159 --> 01:04:58,150
That is correct.

1117
01:05:00,130 --> 01:05:03,122
I'm terribly sorry.

1118
01:05:03,166 --> 01:05:04,793
How can we help?

1119
01:05:07,170 --> 01:05:08,694
I'm not sure that...

1120
01:05:08,772 --> 01:05:11,707
Perhaps a joint rescue mission?

1121
01:05:14,578 --> 01:05:17,547
That is very gracious of you, sir.

1122
01:05:17,614 --> 01:05:20,515
I'll pass your offer on.

1123
01:05:20,584 --> 01:05:21,949
But at this time,

1124
01:05:22,185 --> 01:05:23,948
I think we're doing everything

1125
01:05:24,187 --> 01:05:25,711
that can be done.

1126
01:05:43,640 --> 01:05:45,335
Captain?

1127
01:05:48,845 --> 01:05:51,678
Our strategy depends
on your answer.

1128
01:05:51,715 --> 01:05:54,684
The entire fleet
will know where we are.

1129
01:05:54,718 --> 01:05:55,844
Captain, Sonar.

1130
01:05:55,885 --> 01:05:59,286
We've been overflown
by a multi-engine turboprop.

1131
01:05:59,356 --> 01:06:01,381
Put it on audio.

1132
01:06:04,728 --> 01:06:06,662
Short transients,
close aboard.

1133
01:06:07,864 --> 01:06:09,855
Water entry of small objects.

1134
01:06:09,899 --> 01:06:11,696
Sonar buoys.

1135
01:06:13,236 --> 01:06:13,998
Battle stations.

1136
01:06:14,237 --> 01:06:15,704
Battle stations!

1137
01:06:15,772 --> 01:06:16,739
Battle stations!

1138
01:06:16,773 --> 01:06:17,705
Battle stations!

1139
01:06:17,774 --> 01:06:19,833
How long to Neptune Massif?

1140
01:06:21,811 --> 01:06:23,301
How long?

1141
01:06:23,380 --> 01:06:26,645
4 minutes, 10 seconds.

1142
01:06:26,716 --> 01:06:28,308
Should we bottom the boat?

1143
01:06:28,385 --> 01:06:29,750
No. Too late now.

1144
01:06:29,819 --> 01:06:32,583
We've run out of time.

1145
01:06:32,656 --> 01:06:33,645
Countermeasures.

1146
01:06:33,723 --> 01:06:35,213
Prepare to launch missiles.

1147
01:06:35,258 --> 01:06:36,657
Aye, sir.

1148
01:06:45,320 --> 01:06:46,878
Aircraft on computer guidance.

1149
01:06:46,921 --> 01:06:48,616
Request permission to launch.

1150
01:06:48,690 --> 01:06:51,784
You are authorized
to launch the weapon.

1151
01:06:53,995 --> 01:06:56,122
[Radio]
Weapon is away.

1152
01:06:59,901 --> 01:07:01,266
High speed screw!

1153
01:07:01,336 --> 01:07:02,997
Torpedo in the water!

1154
01:07:03,071 --> 01:07:04,663
Stand by.

1155
01:07:05,940 --> 01:07:07,532
Torpedo is active.

1156
01:07:09,911 --> 01:07:12,004
Torpedo has acquired.

1157
01:07:12,080 --> 01:07:13,843
Launch countermeasures.

1158
01:07:13,915 --> 01:07:15,576
Launch countermeasures.
Aye, sir.

1159
01:07:21,889 --> 01:07:23,220
We're in the lane.

1160
01:07:23,257 --> 01:07:26,158
How long till
the turn at Massif?

1161
01:07:26,227 --> 01:07:27,285
2 minutes, 9 seconds.

1162
01:07:27,362 --> 01:07:30,593
We have no room to maneuver
in these canyons.

1163
01:07:30,665 --> 01:07:32,030
Shut up.

1164
01:07:36,971 --> 01:07:39,303
Torpedo has reached
countermeasures.

1165
01:07:39,374 --> 01:07:40,898
Torpedo has lost contact.

1166
01:07:40,942 --> 01:07:43,035
Massif approaching.

1167
01:07:45,780 --> 01:07:48,044
Torpedo has reacquired.

1168
01:07:48,082 --> 01:07:51,916
Torpedo has reacquired
and is homing.

1169
01:07:51,986 --> 01:07:53,351
Give me the count.

1170
01:07:53,588 --> 01:07:56,921
Turn at Massif 40 degrees starboard
in 30 seconds.

1171
01:07:56,958 --> 01:07:58,983
Time to torpedo impact?

1172
01:07:59,060 --> 01:08:01,085
Torpedo impact, 35 seconds.

1173
01:08:01,162 --> 01:08:02,891
Increase to flank.

1174
01:08:02,964 --> 01:08:03,931
Full ahead flank.

1175
01:08:03,965 --> 01:08:05,091
Full ahead flank.

1176
01:08:05,133 --> 01:08:06,327
Full ahead flank, aye.

1177
01:08:06,401 --> 01:08:08,801
Torpedo impact now 40 seconds.

1178
01:08:10,104 --> 01:08:12,038
35 seconds.

1179
01:08:19,614 --> 01:08:21,081
30 seconds.

1180
01:08:22,016 --> 01:08:23,984
Turn at Massif in...

1181
01:08:24,052 --> 01:08:25,986
7...

1182
01:08:26,020 --> 01:08:27,385
6...

1183
01:08:27,622 --> 01:08:28,953
5...

1184
01:08:29,023 --> 01:08:29,955
4...

1185
01:08:30,024 --> 01:08:31,389
3...
