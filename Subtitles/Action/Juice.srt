00:08:52,274 --> 00:08:55,236
Iike you and your
stupid-ass friends.

00:08:55,277 --> 00:08:57,154
Yeah, well,

178
00:08:57,238 --> 00:09:01,200
I don't need
your tired ass anyway, bitch!

179
00:09:01,283 --> 00:09:02,743
That was real smooth, man.

180
00:09:02,785 --> 00:09:04,078
I'm squashin' her.

181
00:09:04,119 --> 00:09:05,913
That shit is
too much work.

182
00:09:05,955 --> 00:09:07,915
I should've
let you have her.

183
00:09:07,957 --> 00:09:09,917
I let you have her.

184
00:09:09,959 --> 00:09:11,418
Just buggin', man.
What's up?

185
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:12,753
Yeah. I thought so.

186
00:09:12,836 --> 00:09:15,256
\ So you wanna
be a gangster... \\

187
00:09:15,297 --> 00:09:16,882
Yo, Bishop!

188
00:09:18,801 --> 00:09:20,261
What you want?

189
00:09:21,971 --> 00:09:24,682
Your ass, punk!

190
00:09:24,765 --> 00:09:25,724
People been sayin'

191
00:09:25,808 --> 00:09:29,270
that you say
you can bust my ass.

192
00:09:29,311 --> 00:09:31,272
You believe that shit?

193
00:09:31,313 --> 00:09:32,273
So?

194
00:09:35,317 --> 00:09:37,778
Chill, chill,
chill, chill, chill.

195
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:39,780
Smile, man, smile.

196
00:09:39,822 --> 00:09:41,240
See this?

197
00:09:41,282 --> 00:09:43,784
Take a real good look at him,

198
00:09:43,826 --> 00:09:47,288
'cause that's how
a dumb nigger commits suicide.

199
00:09:47,329 --> 00:09:50,791
You thinkyour shit
is that bad, man?

200
00:09:50,833 --> 00:09:53,085
You got that much juice?

201
00:09:53,127 --> 00:09:54,461
God damn right.

202
00:09:54,503 --> 00:09:56,463
Don't nobody
fuckwith me.

203
00:09:56,505 --> 00:09:58,799
'Cause you already
fucked up, man.

204
00:09:58,841 --> 00:10:01,427
You can't fuck up somethin'
that's already fucked up.

205
00:10:01,510 --> 00:10:04,305
Ifyou wasn't
as fucked up as you are,

206
00:10:04,346 --> 00:10:06,432
you'd see
that shit, man!

207
00:10:06,473 --> 00:10:09,059
What a dumb nigger, man.

208
00:10:09,143 --> 00:10:11,770
Fuckyou, you beans and rice
son of a bitch!

209
00:10:11,812 --> 00:10:14,148
Respect me.
I was almost your father,

210
00:10:14,189 --> 00:10:16,483
but the line
was too fucking long!

211
00:10:16,525 --> 00:10:18,819
Hey, hey,
it's cool, man.

212
00:10:18,861 --> 00:10:20,070
It's cool.

213
00:10:20,154 --> 00:10:22,990
Raheem, man, you better
tell your boy somethin',

214
00:10:23,032 --> 00:10:25,826
'cause I don't care
if he's crazy or not.

215
00:10:25,868 --> 00:10:27,953
I'll stomp the shit
out of his ass.

216
00:10:28,037 --> 00:10:29,997
You ain't saying
nothing but a word!

217
00:10:30,039 --> 00:10:32,833
He's just bullshittin'.
He didn't mean it.

218
00:10:32,875 --> 00:10:34,293
Shit if I didn't mean it.

219
00:10:34,335 --> 00:10:36,670
Fuck that little
Puerto Rican maricon!

220
00:10:36,712 --> 00:10:39,298
Maricon? Maricon?
Ifyou're looking' for faggots,

221
00:10:39,381 --> 00:10:41,842
you ain't got to look no farther
than your pa.

222
00:10:41,884 --> 00:10:44,803
I hear he liked bein'
the prison yard whore!

223
00:10:44,845 --> 00:10:46,847
Fuckyou,
motherfucker!

224
00:10:48,390 --> 00:10:51,101
Get away from my store!

225
00:10:51,185 --> 00:10:53,979
I'm gonna shoot
your pee-pee off, man.

226
00:10:59,193 --> 00:11:01,278
Tell me that wasn't
the shit.

227
00:11:01,362 --> 00:11:02,488
You're crazy, man.

228
00:11:02,571 --> 00:11:05,950
Ain't had no fun like that
in a while.

229
00:11:06,033 --> 00:11:09,161
That nigger had you
by your neck and shit.

230
00:11:09,203 --> 00:11:10,621
I swear to God--

231
00:11:10,704 --> 00:11:12,790
What's up, Fat Chops?

232
00:11:12,873 --> 00:11:14,291
What's up, man?

233
00:11:14,375 --> 00:11:15,626
Hey, how you doin'?

234
00:11:15,709 --> 00:11:16,794
You're late, man.

235
00:11:16,877 --> 00:11:18,295
I feel good.

236
00:11:18,379 --> 00:11:20,214
Sorry, man.
I was busy, man.

237
00:11:20,297 --> 00:11:21,966
I had a hard time
gettin' away, man.

238
00:11:22,049 --> 00:11:23,801
Give those chubby palms
a rest,

239
00:11:23,884 --> 00:11:25,719
you'd get here
with the rest of us.

240
00:11:25,803 --> 00:11:28,806
Want to know
why I'm really late?

241
00:11:28,889 --> 00:11:30,808
I was doin'
the hootchy-kootchy

242
00:11:30,891 --> 00:11:33,018
with Donna Bromwell.

243
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:35,187
So you boned
Donna Bromwell?

244
00:11:35,271 --> 00:11:37,147
Yeah, man.
She liked it, too.

245
00:11:37,231 --> 00:11:39,608
My man,
finally got that ass.

246
00:11:39,692 --> 00:11:40,985
I heard that.

247
00:11:41,068 --> 00:11:42,111
Thankyou.
Appreciate it.

248
00:11:42,194 --> 00:11:43,362
So how was it?

249
00:11:43,404 --> 00:11:45,656
It was good.
What do you think?

250
00:11:45,739 --> 00:11:48,325
I heard Donna Bromwell
was a real freak.

251
00:11:48,409 --> 00:11:51,412
The bitch tried to fuck me
on the stove.

252
00:11:51,495 --> 00:11:53,998
She still got that,
uh, tattoo?

253
00:11:54,081 --> 00:11:56,750
No, man. I wasn't lookin'
for no tattoo.

254
00:11:56,834 --> 00:12:01,463
I was doin' the hootchy-kootchy,
my friend.

255
00:12:01,547 --> 00:12:05,009
You knew it was Donna
from that hair on her face.

256
00:12:05,092 --> 00:12:06,427
Yeah, man, come on.

257
00:12:06,510 --> 00:12:08,512
You didn't know about
Donna Bromwell, man?

258
00:12:08,596 --> 00:12:10,139
What, man, what?

259
00:12:10,222 --> 00:12:14,268
That she used to be
Donald Bromwell?

260
00:12:14,351 --> 00:12:15,477
\ Big Don \\

261
00:12:15,561 --> 00:12:16,478
Don Juan.

262
00:12:16,562 --> 00:12:18,355
Fucky'all, man.

263
00:12:18,439 --> 00:12:21,609
Come on, big, hefty,
tub-of-a-man you!

264
00:12:21,692 --> 00:12:23,027
Don't make me
come afteryou!

265
00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:26,280
Get the fuck off me!

266
00:12:26,363 --> 00:12:27,281
My man.

267
00:12:27,364 --> 00:12:30,826
You big
fat-head jalopy.

268
00:12:30,910 --> 00:12:32,077
'Reckin' crew!

269
00:12:33,871 --> 00:12:36,290
Hope you're feelin'
lucky today, my brother,

270
00:12:36,373 --> 00:12:38,792
'cause I'm getting ready
to bust your ass.

271
00:12:38,876 --> 00:12:41,295
You want me
to lie to you?

272
00:12:41,378 --> 00:12:43,797
Just 'cause you
pour syrup on shit

273
00:12:43,881 --> 00:12:45,424
don't make it pancakes.

274
00:12:45,507 --> 00:12:46,467
Q!

275
00:12:46,508 --> 00:12:47,468
What's up?

276
00:12:47,509 --> 00:12:48,636
What's happenin'?

277
00:12:48,719 --> 00:12:51,305
You got that
party tape for me?

278
00:12:51,388 --> 00:12:53,265
Yeah, I got the shit.

279
00:12:53,307 --> 00:12:55,434
My brother, my brother,
my brother, my brother.

280
00:12:55,476 --> 00:12:58,270
Bad news, though.
Bein' that we in a recession,

281
00:12:58,312 --> 00:13:00,773
the shit's gonna cost
$1 5 instead of 1 0.

282
00:13:00,814 --> 00:13:02,399
- $1 5.
- $1 5?

283
00:13:02,483 --> 00:13:03,776
Hit the button!
Hit the button!

284
00:13:03,817 --> 00:13:05,110
Pow!

285
00:13:05,152 --> 00:13:07,780
Kiss? Money?
What you gonna do, sweetheart?

286
00:13:07,821 --> 00:13:09,782
I ain't got all day.

287
00:13:09,823 --> 00:13:13,077
Do what you're told.
Give me a kiss.

288
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:15,287
Was the last party
serious?

289
00:13:15,329 --> 00:13:16,789
It was slammin'?

290
00:13:16,830 --> 00:13:18,290
It was all right.

291
00:13:18,332 --> 00:13:19,625
It was dope, right?

292
00:13:19,667 --> 00:13:21,293
Do you hit
Brenda's skins?

293
00:13:21,335 --> 00:13:22,461
What?

294
00:13:22,503 --> 00:13:24,296
Did Brenda Witherspoon
shine your silver?

295
00:13:24,338 --> 00:13:26,257
My mother shines
our silver.

296
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:28,300
All you could see
was that butt.

297
00:13:28,342 --> 00:13:30,803
I don't know why you thought
that was so tough.

298
00:13:30,844 --> 00:13:32,805
She got the snappy-nappy
dugout piece.

299
00:13:32,846 --> 00:13:34,682
Snappy-nappy
dugout piece?

300
00:13:35,933 --> 00:13:38,143
Did you fuck
Brenda Witherspoon?

301
00:13:39,687 --> 00:13:41,146
Yeah, I did, man.

302
00:13:41,188 --> 00:13:42,648
Yeah?
You did, right?

303
00:13:42,690 --> 00:13:44,733
$1 5, G.

304
00:13:44,817 --> 00:13:47,319
Lord, I came
at the perfect time.

305
00:13:47,361 --> 00:13:49,321
Pop two quarters in,
pop-tart,

306
00:13:49,363 --> 00:13:51,323
and let's get it on.

307
00:13:51,365 --> 00:13:53,242
Let me get
in that ass.

308
00:13:53,325 --> 00:13:56,245
What makes you think
you can beat me?

309
00:13:56,328 --> 00:13:57,413
Two reasons.

310
00:13:57,496 --> 00:14:00,749
1 --if I lose,
I'm going to beat that ass.

311
00:14:00,833 --> 00:14:04,253
2--if I lose,
I'm going to beat that ass.

312
00:14:04,336 --> 00:14:06,797
Get this goddamn
game started,

313
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:08,257

314
00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:09,758
What's up?
What's up?

315
00:14:09,842 --> 00:14:12,720
What you got?
Hey! Hey!

330
00:15:42,309 --> 00:15:44,853

You all right?

336
00:16:01,370 --> 00:16:02,830
I know'd we could

337
00:16:02,871 --> 00:16:04,331
Bust this!

Bastards!

339
00:16:05,374 --> 00:16:08,335
You can't play

340
00:16:08,377 --> 00:16:09,545
Stupid bitch!

341
00:16:09,628 --> 00:16:13,132
\ Fat-ass Steel

Fuck, no.

00:24:19,243 --> 00:24:20,160
Aah!

531
00:24:20,244 --> 00:24:21,662
Aah!

532
00:24:21,745 --> 00:24:23,664
All right,
there he goes.

533
00:24:23,747 --> 00:24:25,791
Bust 'em!
Bust 'em!

534
00:24:25,833 --> 00:24:27,459
Boo-yeah!

535
00:24:27,501 --> 00:24:28,460
Boo-yeah!

536
00:24:28,502 --> 00:24:29,461
Pow! Boo-yeah!

537
00:24:29,503 --> 00:24:31,005
Aw, shit!

538
00:24:38,387 --> 00:24:41,765
Damn, Steel.
What the fuck is this mess, man?

539
00:24:41,849 --> 00:24:43,350
Bacon and eggs
and hot sauce, man.

540
00:24:43,434 --> 00:24:45,561
I mix it like this
all the time.

541
00:24:45,644 --> 00:24:49,398
I'm too hungry
to throw this shit away.

542
00:24:49,481 --> 00:24:51,066
But I only did it
foryou, Ed.

543
00:24:52,192 --> 00:24:54,320
Cody still ain't
gonna like to hear

544
00:24:54,361 --> 00:24:56,447
that she got it
in the back.

545
00:24:56,530 --> 00:24:59,575
Oh, shit!
Shot his moms in the back.

546
00:24:59,658 --> 00:25:02,077
Yo, Steel. Let me borrow
these two till tomorrow.

547
00:25:02,161 --> 00:25:03,579
This shit's dope.

548
00:25:03,662 --> 00:25:06,081
Excuse me, partner,
can you keep that shit down?

549
00:25:06,165 --> 00:25:08,459
You see me watching TV.

550
00:25:08,542 --> 00:25:09,460
Heh heh heh!

551
00:25:09,543 --> 00:25:10,628
[Gunshot]

552
00:25:20,888 --> 00:25:21,847
Made it, Ma!

553
00:25:21,889 --> 00:25:23,349
Made it, Ma!

554
00:25:23,390 --> 00:25:24,350
Top of the world!

555
00:25:24,391 --> 00:25:25,851
Top of the world!

556
00:25:25,893 --> 00:25:27,353
Yo!

557
00:25:30,397 --> 00:25:33,359
Ifyou gotta go out,
that's how you go out.

558
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:37,071
That motherfucker took
his destiny in his own hands.

559
00:25:37,154 --> 00:25:38,239
Mmm, some destiny.

560
00:25:38,322 --> 00:25:39,865
What you know about it,
Big Chops?

561
00:25:39,907 --> 00:25:41,200
What you ever control?

562
00:25:41,242 --> 00:25:43,702
I control my life.

563
00:25:43,744 --> 00:25:44,870
That's bullshit.

564
00:25:44,912 --> 00:25:47,456
I got more control
overyour life than you do.

565
00:25:47,539 --> 00:25:49,166
How you figure that?

566
00:25:49,250 --> 00:25:50,960
I'm lettin' you breathe,
ain't I?

567
00:25:51,043 --> 00:25:53,921
You can't even
walkyour own block

568
00:25:53,963 --> 00:25:56,799
without getting fucked up
by Radames, let's not forget.

569
00:25:56,882 --> 00:25:58,259
Ha ha ha.

570
00:25:58,342 --> 00:26:00,803
Oh, shit!
It's Blizzard!

571
00:26:00,886 --> 00:26:03,681
A gunman was killed
in a shoot-out with police

572
00:26:03,764 --> 00:26:06,183
as he attempted to rob
the Harlemwood bar

573
00:26:06,267 --> 00:26:08,143
just under an hour ago.

574
00:26:08,227 --> 00:26:09,353
The gunman,

575
00:26:09,436 --> 00:26:10,688
identified as 20-year-old
Barnett Jerkins,

576
00:26:10,771 --> 00:26:13,482
wounded two officers before
he himself was killed.

577
00:26:13,565 --> 00:26:16,819
On the news at 7:00,
we'll have more on this story

578
00:26:16,902 --> 00:26:18,821
as well as an update
on the campaign...

579
00:26:18,904 --> 00:26:20,823
Y o, man, we were
just down there.

580
00:26:20,906 --> 00:26:22,825
To have the already
financially strapped city

581
00:26:22,908 --> 00:26:24,201
provide more
police protection

582
00:26:24,285 --> 00:26:26,745
on the subway els
after dark.

583
00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:36,839
What the fuck are you doing, man?
Come here!

584
00:26:36,922 --> 00:26:38,924
Fuckin' Radames.

585
00:26:41,427 --> 00:26:43,721
We ain't shit.

586
00:26:43,804 --> 00:26:46,015
Man, what's your problem?

587
00:26:46,098 --> 00:26:47,516
You're my fuckin' problem!

588
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:49,518
People sweat us
on the street,

589
00:26:49,602 --> 00:26:51,353
and you don't even
give a fuck.

590
00:26:51,437 --> 00:26:53,188
I thinkyou're
exaggerating.

591
00:26:53,272 --> 00:26:54,690
That's bullshit, man!

592
00:26:54,773 --> 00:26:57,776
We run from the cops,
we run from Radames,

593
00:26:57,860 --> 00:26:59,320
we run from
security guards,

594
00:26:59,361 --> 00:27:02,323
we run from Old Man Quiles
and his bullshit store

595
00:27:02,364 --> 00:27:04,825
when he come
with that bullshit gun.

596
00:27:04,867 --> 00:27:07,328
All we do
is fuckin' run!

597
00:27:07,369 --> 00:27:10,247
I feel like I'm on
the god damn track team.

598
00:27:10,331 --> 00:27:11,790
I'm serious!

599
00:27:11,874 --> 00:27:13,500
What's the matter,
Raheem?

600
00:27:13,584 --> 00:27:15,002
Nothin' to say?

601
00:27:17,379 --> 00:27:19,173
That's 'cause
you know I'm right.

602
00:27:19,214 --> 00:27:20,966
In your heart,
you know I'm right.

603
00:27:21,008 --> 00:27:24,053
Yo, big man! Ifyou want
respect, you gotta earn it.

604
00:27:24,136 --> 00:27:25,554
You damn right!

605
00:27:25,638 --> 00:27:27,556
You gotta be ready
to go down,

606
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:29,308
stand up,
and die like Blizzard did

607
00:27:29,391 --> 00:27:30,768
ifyou want some juice.

608
00:27:30,851 --> 00:27:32,811
Blizzard? Blizzard ain't
stickin' up to nothin' now.

609
00:27:32,895 --> 00:27:34,855
That's 'cause we wasn't there
to back him up!

610
00:27:34,897 --> 00:27:36,440
Ifwe was there--

611
00:27:36,523 --> 00:27:39,276
There'd be five dead niggers
instead of one!

612
00:27:41,028 --> 00:27:43,447
You ain't sayin' nothin' now,
right, big man?

613
00:27:43,530 --> 00:27:45,449
I never thought
I'd see the day

614
00:27:45,532 --> 00:27:47,076
when you'd
talk like a punk.

615
00:27:47,159 --> 00:27:48,160
Fuckyou, man!

616
00:27:48,202 --> 00:27:49,161
Yo, chill!

617
00:27:49,203 --> 00:27:50,829
Fuck chill!
Checkyourself, Q.

618
00:27:50,913 --> 00:27:52,289
You gotta
snatch some collars

619
00:27:52,373 --> 00:27:54,291
and let them
motherfuckers know

620
00:27:54,375 --> 00:27:56,293
you're there
to take them out

621
00:27:56,377 --> 00:27:58,170
anytime you
feel like it.

622
00:27:58,212 --> 00:28:00,172
You gotta get the ground
beneath your feet,

623
00:28:00,214 --> 00:28:01,799
get the wind
behind your back,

624
00:28:01,882 --> 00:28:03,300
and go out in a blaze.

625
00:28:03,384 --> 00:28:04,802
Otherwise
you ain't shit.

626
00:28:04,885 --> 00:28:08,013
You might as well be dead
your damn yourself.

627
00:28:08,055 --> 00:28:10,015
You tryin' to tell me
I ain't shit?

628
00:28:10,057 --> 00:28:12,518
I ain't tryin'
to tell you shit.

629
00:28:12,559 --> 00:28:15,521
I'll tell your mama
you ain't shit.

630
00:28:17,064 --> 00:28:20,025
Yo, man, what
are we fightin' for?

631
00:28:20,067 --> 00:28:22,820
I don't know, nigger.
You ready to die?

632
00:28:22,903 --> 00:28:24,321
You're fucked up, man.

633
00:28:24,405 --> 00:28:27,491
Don't turn your fuckin'
back on me, nigger!

634
00:28:27,575 --> 00:28:30,578
You broke
the fuckin' vase, man!

635
00:28:30,661 --> 00:28:32,454
What the fuck
is y'all doin', man?

636
00:28:32,538 --> 00:28:34,456
Damn, man!
What the fuck?

637
00:28:34,540 --> 00:28:37,376
Messin' up my shit, man!

638
00:28:37,418 --> 00:28:38,377
Feed y'all!

639
00:28:38,419 --> 00:28:39,712
Sorry, man. Here!

640
00:28:39,753 --> 00:28:41,213
Fuck that money, man!

641
00:28:41,255 --> 00:28:42,715
Look at that shit!

642
00:28:42,756 --> 00:28:44,717
I got to tell
my parents--

643
00:28:44,758 --> 00:28:46,218
Shut the fuck up!

644
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:47,720
All right, that's it!

645
00:28:47,761 --> 00:28:48,721
That's it!

646
00:28:48,762 --> 00:28:51,599
Bishop, I want you and Q

647
00:28:51,682 --> 00:28:54,059
to settle this shit
right now!

648
00:28:54,101 --> 00:28:56,270
Come on, y'all.

649
00:28:56,353 --> 00:28:57,271
You're like brothers.

650
00:28:57,354 --> 00:28:59,148
Fuck that.
You are brothers!

651
00:28:59,231 --> 00:29:01,775
Fuck that.
We used to be like brothers.

652
00:29:01,859 --> 00:29:04,778
All right,
we're going to squash it.

653
00:29:04,862 --> 00:29:06,280
What do you say?

654
00:29:06,363 --> 00:29:07,489
Bishop?

655
00:29:09,867 --> 00:29:11,785
Yeah, it's cool.

656
00:29:32,973 --> 00:29:34,224
All right.

657
00:29:46,403 --> 00:29:47,821
I'm not makin' sense!
You're not makin' sense!

658
00:29:48,405 --> 00:29:49,823
[Doorbell Rings]

659
00:29:49,907 --> 00:29:51,325
You know why?

660
00:29:52,534 --> 00:29:54,620
What?

661
00:29:54,703 --> 00:29:57,122
Uh, how you doin'?
Is Yolanda there?

662
00:29:57,206 --> 00:29:58,916
Who the hell are you?

663
00:29:58,999 --> 00:30:00,918
Hi, Q.
Let him in, Frank.

664
00:30:07,341 --> 00:30:08,759
Have a seat.

665
00:30:08,842 --> 00:30:10,761
I'm just cleaning out
some of Frank's things.

666
00:30:10,844 --> 00:30:13,597
Um, Frank, Q.
Q, Frank.

667
00:30:21,855 --> 00:30:23,440
How you doin'?

668
00:30:34,034 --> 00:30:35,494
Q.

669
00:30:35,578 --> 00:30:38,539
What, did names like
Mustafah and Akbar

670
00:30:38,581 --> 00:30:40,499
become too hard
to spell?

671
00:30:40,583 --> 00:30:42,960
My real name is Quincy,

672
00:30:43,043 --> 00:30:45,462
and I'm not too fond
of that name,

673
00:30:45,546 --> 00:30:48,465
so people call me Q
or GQ, you know,

674
00:30:48,549 --> 00:30:49,883
Iike a nickname,
abbreviation.

675
00:30:49,925 --> 00:30:51,385
Well, uh, Quincy,

676
00:30:51,427 --> 00:30:55,139
shouldn't you be out stealing
hubcaps or something like that?

677
00:30:55,222 --> 00:30:56,724
Asshole.

678
00:30:56,807 --> 00:30:59,852
Excuse me? Speak up.
I can't hearyou, boy.

679
00:30:59,893 --> 00:31:01,854
O.K., Frank, I found it.

680
00:31:01,895 --> 00:31:04,064
Remember these?

681
00:31:04,148 --> 00:31:05,566
Ha ha ha.

682
00:31:05,649 --> 00:31:08,569
What the hell are you laughing at,
you chain snatcher?

683
00:31:08,652 --> 00:31:10,571
Look, who is this kid,

684
00:31:10,654 --> 00:31:12,573
and what is he
doing here?

685
00:31:12,656 --> 00:31:14,575
Frank, don't you think
it's a little late

686
00:31:14,658 --> 00:31:16,577
to try acting
like a husband now?

687
00:31:16,660 --> 00:31:19,079
You're taking this
save-the-children shit too far.

688
00:31:19,163 --> 00:31:20,080
Bye.

689
00:31:20,164 --> 00:31:21,916
Just telling you
foryour own good.

690
00:31:21,999 --> 00:31:23,000
Bye, Frank.

691
00:31:23,083 --> 00:31:25,002
I can't express
concern, what?

692
00:31:30,007 --> 00:31:31,508
So that's him, huh?

693
00:31:32,676 --> 00:31:34,887
That's him.

694
00:31:34,929 --> 00:31:36,931
You know, he got a real
attitude problem.

695
00:31:37,014 --> 00:31:38,265
Definitely.

696
00:31:46,023 --> 00:31:47,942
Mmm, baby.

697
00:31:55,950 --> 00:31:57,409
You're sweatin' already.

I been working out.

699
00:31:59,495 --> 00:32:02,748
You don't mind
a little sweat, do you?

700
00:32:02,831 --> 00:32:05,918
I'm deejay Ralph McDaniels here.

701
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:09,421
\ Hey hey \

702
00:32:09,505 --> 00:32:12,091

00:32:25,980 --> 00:32:28,941
\ I pray my Lord

more than a brother.
