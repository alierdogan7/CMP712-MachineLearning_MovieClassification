My mother was in love with one man, but her family forced her to
marry another.

erase her shame of infidelity.

She went out into the garden, and ..

27
00:07:13,059 --> 00:07:17,888
poured petrol on her face... and she lit a match.

31

the little girl that was sold was you

32
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:37,448
Why are you telling me this now?

How do you think I know so much about him?

36
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:47,491
It's to Zaef family that I was sold.

37
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:51,090
Why are you risking showing you face
to the camera then?

38
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:53,399

00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:16,799
Finally, at the shelter
... and not at the scene.

183
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:17,847
Questions?

184
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:22,638
Maybe you want to konw. Elsa Casanovais the journalist who
says we have nothing to do in Afghanistan.

185
00:20:22,673 --> 00:20:26,567
Another question / Yes!
Is she pretty?

186
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:38,882
Do not shoot! I beg you!Please

187
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:53,285
Why don't you ask me for
an interview ?

188
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:56,882
It would have been the civilized way to
go about things.

189
00:20:56,920 --> 00:21:00,891
Civilized?

190
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:04,244
You call me "The Butcher of Kabul".

191
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:07,045
Afghan women worst friend

192
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:11,085
Wasn't that
the title of your last article?

193

What have you done to Maina?

194
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:18,283
What I've I done to Maina?

195
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:23,407
What have your lies done to Maina?

196
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:27,768
oh I know you.

197
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:31,691
Your family, so great,

198
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:34,564
look at you now ...

199
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:37,410
sitting here, like a dog.

200

influential chiefs.

203
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:59,685
and yet ... you are sitting there with me ...

204
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:06,805
only you chose to be here.

205
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:12,562
Did I invite you into my country

206
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:17,582
to spread democracy at gunpoint and drive my people crazy?

207
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:22,605
it's still better than selling
a 12 year old child.

208
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:33,605
I believe in an interview it is customary for questions derived from
the person holding the camera should be asking the questions.

209
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:41,885
and I find this question to be
very appropriate right now.

210
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:45,891
Do you ...believe in God?

211
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:49,880
Yes, I believe in God.

212
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:01,162

00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,401

216
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:32,040

It's out of question, we see a french journalist decapitate

234

What are the chances of success?

240
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:55,199
In this operation there is no guarantee,
Mr. President.

241
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:57,202
that's why they are called "special".

242
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:02,971
You can go on the operation.

243

You do not deserve trust.

relaxed.

333

You will follow me and stay near me.

Do you agree?

335
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,764
Ok / Good.

336
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:13,799

337
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:17,486
Thank you.

338
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:19,807
Let's go.

339
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:30,085
Try again to tighten it and I'll knock you out.

340
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:50,925

at the rendezvous point.

345
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:06,040

The Taliban can also tap it.

347
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,199
I think they already tap the signal.

348
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:10,486
You go ahead with Marius.

349
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:12,045

I'll explain it later, we have to move!

352
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:20,399
Sure, if you got a pack of ammo and a radio.

353

354
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:28,451

Damn, the whole army!

356
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:52,767
go, my friend!

357
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:01,087

Getting they angry.

358
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:14,562

wait ... wait ...

360
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:23,205
Now!

361
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:39,605
I don't know why, but I hesitate more and more 
every time I have to press a button.

362
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:43,690
It has to be a brain problem, 
I have to talk about it with my psychiatrist.

363
00:41:43,720 --> 00:41:45,799
Shut up and do it my captain.

364
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:48,371
Marius.

365
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:50,004
May I help you?

366
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:56,087
I will replace the bandages.

367
00:41:56,120 --> 00:41:58,088
You'll have to sew it.

368
00:41:58,120 --> 00:42:00,043
Of course,

369
00:42:00,080 --> 00:42:03,599
22 km to the extraction point ! 
On the roof of bum fuck nowhere!

370
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:05,602
watch the language
There is a lady with us.

371
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:08,844
Sorry, it should be the emotion.

372
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:14,205
I remind
I am not very good with the needle.

373
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:20,285
Are you ready?

374
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:23,565
You all right?

375
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:26,490
Good ... All right.

376
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:34,370
it's a distress signal.

377
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:36,999
twenty km from the extraction point.

378
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,081
Are they moving?

379
00:42:38,120 --> 00:42:41,249
Negative.

380
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:44,482
We just have half-hour from our trackers.

381
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:45,646
Helicopters?

382
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:47,682
Even if they got our signal, 
they'll already go to the meeting point.

383
00:42:47,720 --> 00:42:48,846
Okay?

384
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:51,799
Sorry, already
3 days we did not eat.

385
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:53,450
She has to take her time.

386
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,048
Lucas read your article.

387
00:42:57,080 --> 00:43:01,085
Critics of the war,
the soldiers do not like.

388
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:02,961
You're repaired?

389
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:04,286
The miss did it ?

390
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:06,163
Efface your smile.

391
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:08,199
Your analysis was very interesting.

392
00:43:08,200 --> 00:43:09,770
Thank you.

393
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:11,040
I didn't say that I agree with you.

394
00:43:11,080 --> 00:43:14,607
We can be here for good or bad reasons,
 it's our job, we don't do politics.

395
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:43,930
It seems to be hot there! 
What is it?

396
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:47,568
Our taxi are getting shooted.

397
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:51,599
They gain ground, we have less than ten minutes.

398
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:54,365
Damn!

399
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:56,687
We stop the recuperation.

400
00:43:57,320 --> 00:43:59,322
Get up!

401
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:10,047
It has been a failure.

402
00:44:10,080 --> 00:44:11,570
Nobody was at the extraction point.

403
00:44:11,600 --> 00:44:15,491
One helicopter made an emergency landing
with a seriously injured person.

404
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:16,965
Hostages?

405
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:20,641
There is still no news about them since three hours.

406
00:45:18,080 --> 00:45:20,242
Day 2 </ i>

407
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:38,805
We need to stop,
she can't walk more.

408
00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:41,528
Stop. Break.

409
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:06,769
Do you have a plan "B"?

410
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:09,929
No, we do not have a plan "B".

411
00:46:12,600 --> 00:46:14,284
What will he decide?

412
00:46:14,320 --> 00:46:16,243
Don't know.

413
00:46:16,280 --> 00:46:18,681
But I'm sure we won't like it.

414
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:22,691
Hey, Capitain
Victor!

415
00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:27,891
Thank you.

416
00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:33,967
So
what do we do?

417
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:38,005
To go to Afghanistan there is only
one exit door and it's there!

418
00:46:42,600 --> 00:46:47,367
Are you crazy?
What are they talking about?

419
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:51,405
The command is to bring you back
and we will do it ...

420
00:46:51,800 --> 00:46:55,805
Is there a better idea?

421
00:46:56,880 --> 00:47:00,885
An hour of anonymous glory 
or my anonymous eternity ...

422
00:47:17,600 --> 00:47:20,046
Every minute the possibility
of their survival is reduced.

423
00:47:20,080 --> 00:47:23,199
Do not stop
keep looking.

424
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:25,885
Everybody stays in alert.

425
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,799
How did you get here?

426
00:47:45,800 --> 00:47:47,245
Parachute.

427
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:49,681
You understand well what I mean.

428
00:47:49,720 --> 00:47:51,165
Finally!

429
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:54,999
Been wondering when you would
woke up as a journalist?

430
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:56,968
What do you want to know?

431
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:59,890
How I ended up with this decerebrate gang
in uniform?

432
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:02,571
No,that's not what I wanted to say.

433
00:48:02,600 --> 00:48:05,599
It's okay!
There is not just genius in the army!

434
00:48:05,600 --> 00:48:07,999
But in you work neither.

435
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:11,049
Are you married?

436
00:48:11,080 --> 00:48:13,367
Now not.

437
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:19,210
Do you want biscuits with the tea?

438
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:22,599
What ?
You know that's impossible.

439
00:48:22,600 --> 00:48:25,251
You prefer if we wait them here !

440
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:27,886
I hope you know what you're doing.

441
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:29,570
So do I.

442
00:48:29,600 --> 00:48:32,399
You're very brave.

443
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:35,165
No, that's not courageous ?

444
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:38,044
The courage was this woman
in the village.

445
00:48:38,080 --> 00:48:40,999
Before they shoot, she was looking at her killers faces ...

446
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,765
Do you know what she did ?

447
00:48:43,800 --> 00:48:46,485
She smiled to them ...

448
00:48:46,520 --> 00:48:49,399
And what did I do?

449
00:48:49,400 --> 00:48:53,405
Nothing.

450
00:48:54,600 --> 00:48:58,605
Sorry, but the talking is not really my thing.

451
00:48:59,080 --> 00:49:00,799
Are you okay?

452
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:02,211
Yes.

453
00:49:30,080 --> 00:49:31,889
<i> 3rd DAY </i>

454
00:49:35,400 --> 00:49:36,890
Tic-Tac.

455
00:49:39,160 --> 00:49:41,242
Ok, I got it.

456
00:49:56,600 --> 00:49:58,762
Is he trustworthy ?
What ?

457
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:01,280
Reliable? Yes or no?

458
00:50:04,080 --> 00:50:08,085
His whole family were massacred by the Taliban.
Is that enough?

459
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:16,049
You can use this?

460
00:50:21,680 --> 00:50:22,886
Alright.

461
00:50:24,040 --> 00:50:25,280
Thank you.

462
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:31,643
The breakfast is coming.

463
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:44,086
They will not let us go.

464
00:50:44,120 --> 00:50:46,168
That's because they like you.

465
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:53,999
Elsa? What did you do to get they angry like that?

466
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,241
This becomes a personnal affair.

467
00:50:56,280 --> 00:50:58,169
Sorry, I don't understand.

468
00:50:58,200 --> 00:51:01,886
I don't want to disturb, but they
are getting closer!

469
00:51:03,600 --> 00:51:04,965
He will not give up.

470
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:06,889
He will do everything to get me back.

471
00:51:06,920 --> 00:51:09,082
It's getting worse and worse.

472
00:51:10,480 --> 00:51:12,960
Ignore. Let's go.

473
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,002
Let's go.

474
00:51:21,600 --> 00:51:25,199
Damn, they are getting us running for three days.

475
00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:29,205
I agree. Aren't you tired?

476
00:51:36,280 --> 00:51:38,599
You. Stay with her.

477
00:51:38,600 --> 00:51:40,364
Yes, sir.

478
00:52:22,920 --> 00:52:26,049
Shoot, shoot!

479
00:52:50,280 --> 00:52:51,805
Go , go ,go !

480
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:56,609
Again!

481
00:53:01,200 --> 00:53:02,690
Change!

482
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:39,811
Change!

483
00:53:50,680 --> 00:53:53,411
Change!
Got It!

484
00:54:23,200 --> 00:54:25,521
How! The attacks!

485
00:54:25,880 --> 00:54:27,041
Attack!

486
00:54:27,080 --> 00:54:29,765
They're like the devil!

487
00:54:29,800 --> 00:54:31,399
You mean all attacks!

488
00:54:31,400 --> 00:54:33,050
Why?

489
00:54:33,080 --> 00:54:37,085
Hindu Kush Mountains
will kill this woman.

490
00:54:39,880 --> 00:54:43,399
Look what you said?

491
00:54:43,400 --> 00:54:45,926
Okli!

492
00:54:47,800 --> 00:54:51,600
Western women
harder than you think!

493
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:55,810
Exit all!

494
00:54:57,000 --> 00:55:00,049
All-out attack!

495
00:55:22,200 --> 00:55:24,168
<i> Day 4 </ i></i>

496
00:55:30,880 --> 00:55:33,565
We're in big trouble.

497
00:55:33,600 --> 00:55:36,399
"How can there be a failure"?

498
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:39,210
"Defence indefensible"

499
00:55:39,880 --> 00:55:43,123
We would do nothing, 
the critics would always be the same!

500
00:55:43,680 --> 00:55:47,685
I am sure there are six mens
in the mountains to get her out.

501
00:56:03,600 --> 00:56:06,444
Friends or Enemies?

502
00:56:06,680 --> 00:56:09,650
The next pass is in five kilometers.

503
00:56:09,680 --> 00:56:12,604
we won't do it if we don't have food and rest.

504
00:56:15,200 --> 00:56:18,124
What the fuck are they doing there?

505
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:24,121
What she is doing is very
wise ...

506
00:56:24,160 --> 00:56:26,891
Ask for hospitality ...

507
00:56:28,080 --> 00:56:32,085
We never refuse it.
not even to an enemy .

508
00:56:35,600 --> 00:56:38,570
It is tradition.

509
00:56:49,400 --> 00:56:52,529
Next time I'll handcuff you.

510
00:56:58,800 --> 00:57:01,399
Assalamualaikum!

Greetings!

512
00:57:05,680 --> 00:57:09,685
Ask him where are the children?

513
00:57:10,880 --> 00:57:18,685
This summer the Taliban, they take all
and 17 adults.

514
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:21,161
What for?

515
00:57:21,200 --> 00:57:23,248
Entered into madrassas.

516
00:57:23,280 --> 00:57:27,285
Then it will return to
implementation of Sharia doctrine.

517
00:57:28,680 --> 00:57:31,843
Not surprising,
they don't like them.

518
00:57:37,880 --> 00:57:39,799
What do you think about it?

519
00:57:39,800 --> 00:57:41,404
Good. Take it.

520
00:57:41,440 --> 00:57:42,965
This is not nothing.

521
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:45,480
Maybe you will need?

522
00:57:45,520 --> 00:57:48,091
Ok. Thank you.

523
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:54,399

524
00:57:57,520 --> 00:57:59,170

530
00:58:15,120 --> 00:58:16,804
Take, friends,
does not fit!

531
00:58:18,320 --> 00:58:21,847
Take cover! Hide! / In the shelter! Faster!

00:58:22,320 --> 00:58:23,481
Quick! All to the shelter!
Hide!

Marius! No!

534
00:58:27,800 --> 00:58:29,399
He's dead, dead!

535
00:58:29,400 --> 00:58:31,084
Victor, faster!

536
00:58:31,120 --> 00:58:32,246
Leave him!

537
00:58:32,280 --> 00:58:34,806
He is dead!

538
00:58:39,920 --> 00:58:41,331
Go, go!

539
00:58:43,800 --> 00:58:46,724
Behind the wall!

540
00:59:52,600 --> 00:59:55,922
Want to pray for Marius?

541
00:59:56,520 --> 00:59:59,603
It's an honor.

Go! Go!

544
01:01:08,600 --> 01:01:12,605
Wait! Wait!

545
01:01:13,400 --> 01:01:16,051
I have to stay.

546
01:01:18,200 --> 01:01:22,205
If I have to die in the mountains,

They gave us
hospitality and because of that they are all going to die!

556
01:01:51,400 --> 01:01:54,882
I don't care! 
We already lost Marius because a fucking journalist!

557

01:10:40,160 --> 01:10:41,366
Everything will be fine.

615
01:10:41,400 --> 01:10:43,399
You can do it my friend!  
Do we wait Elijah?

616
01:10:43,400 --> 01:10:45,368
No.

617
01:10:45,800 --> 01:10:47,723
Why not?

618
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:53,570

01:11:31,400 --> 01:11:32,481

Sit down.

01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:41,765
Leave me!

622
01:11:41,800 --> 01:11:42,961
Leave me! Leave me here!

623
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:45,799
Only if you're already dead.

624
01:11:45,800 --> 01:11:48,280
You'll survive!

625
01:11:48,320 --> 01:11:49,970
Stay.

626
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:51,570
Ok.

627
01:11:51,600 --> 01:11:54,001
We can't go on like that.

628
01:11:54,080 --> 01:11:56,447
How much altitude are we?

629
01:11:56,480 --> 01:12:00,485

630
01:12:00,520 --> 01:12:02,568

631
01:12:02,600 --> 01:12:06,599
Temperatures will continue to drop.

632
01:12:06,600 --> 01:12:07,965
This is not good.

633
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:11,721
Everything will be fine!
Everything will be fine!

634
01:12:13,080 --> 01:12:16,402
We have to find a shelter.

635
01:12:20,680 --> 01:12:24,685
Victor, let's go!
Elsa take my blanket ..

636
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:26,081

638
01:12:30,600 --> 01:12:32,762

644
01:13:25,920 --> 01:13:27,524

645
01:13:29,680 --> 01:13:30,966
He is suffocating!

646
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:33,685
We have to open his mouth!

647
01:13:36,880 --> 01:13:39,565
Come on, come on!

648
01:13:39,600 --> 01:13:43,321
OK, Victor.

649
01:13:44,080 --> 01:13:46,845
Breathe, breathe! Come on!

650
01:13:46,880 --> 01:13:50,566

I even don't hate you!

654
01:16:16,280 --> 01:16:17,361
How are you?

655
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:21,241
I'm almost gone, right?

656
01:16:21,280 --> 01:16:24,966
It's important that you get back.

657
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:28,083
Tic-Tac, nine years ago,
lost his wife.

658
01:16:28,120 --> 01:16:32,091
I wish he can be happy!

659
01:16:33,400 --> 01:16:35,971

No!

665
01:18:50,400 --> 01:18:54,405
What are you doing?

666
01:18:54,880 --> 01:18:58,885
How many of us have to die, only
to understand that we will never be found?

667
01:18:59,200 --> 01:19:02,443
Who's next
You or me?

668
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:06,199
What do you want?

669
01:19:06,200 --> 01:19:08,362

673
01:19:19,280 --> 01:19:21,282
Do you have children?

674
01:19:21,320 --> 01:19:22,765
No.

675
01:19:22,800 --> 01:19:26,805
So we will take you home,
and you will have children ... a lot.

676
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:31,571
Listen carefully.
Lisa is pregnant!

677
01:19:31,600 --> 01:19:35,605
So you will go home and take care of your wife !

678
01:20:21,280 --> 01:20:24,887
I do not have children either.

679
01:20:25,400 --> 01:20:28,529
Is it an offer capitain?

680
01:20:28,800 --> 01:20:32,805
No, seriously
I hope we can see each other again later.

681
01:20:40,800 --> 01:20:44,441
Is that true, I'll be a father?

682
01:20:45,480 --> 01:20:48,324
Yes, old boy!

683
01:21:13,280 --> 01:21:15,442
Day-8 </ i>

684

Damn it.

687
01:21:41,080 --> 01:21:44,199
Damn, why did she never say anything 
about it?

688
01:21:44,200 --> 01:21:45,884
because of the honor.
She has guts!

689
01:21:47,600 --> 01:21:50,840
You have balls, 
you're waiting she faints to say something nice!

690
01:21:59,880 --> 01:22:02,799
Do not look,
turn around!

691
01:22:02,800 --> 01:22:06,125
Everything will be fine.

692
01:22:20,200 --> 01:22:22,282
Do you know what said Victor
before he died?

693
01:22:22,320 --> 01:22:25,130
I love this job ...

01:22:38,680 --> 01:22:40,409
Day 9 </ i>

695
01:22:42,480 --> 01:22:46,326
How can you become reporter
in a dangerous country like this?

696
01:22:47,280 --> 01:22:51,199
I love this country.

697
01:22:51,200 --> 01:22:54,283
Replace it with the Netherlands
would be better.

698
01:22:54,320 --> 01:22:55,685
Why the Netherlands?

699
01:22:55,720 --> 01:22:59,691
That's flat.

700
01:22:59,800 --> 01:23:02,201
Why do you came here?

701
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:05,082
It was
here or the Netherlands.

702
01:23:05,120 --> 01:23:07,805
It's better the Netherlands.

703
01:23:07,840 --> 01:23:10,491

Maybe in another life.

710

We are still not at this point. alright ?

711
01:23:36,720 --> 01:23:39,405

Do you see this mountain we just pass?

729
01:30:29,320 --> 01:30:33,291
This is the border.

OK.

735
01:31:54,200 --> 01:31:56,567
Elsa,

736
01:31:56,600 --> 01:31:59,888
You should continue without us.

737
01:32:13,600 --> 01:32:16,524
Take it !
 No, no.

738
01:32:17,200 --> 01:32:20,090
I will not leave
you here.

739
01:32:20,120 --> 01:32:23,647
Look at us ...

740
01:32:23,680 --> 01:32:26,126
We won't be further.

741
01:32:28,280 --> 01:32:32,285
Please take this.

742
01:32:44,880 --> 01:32:47,087
Take this compass too.

743
01:32:49,880 --> 01:32:51,291
Take it, Elsa.

744
01:32:53,400 --> 01:32:57,405
Go to the west, Elsa
Did you hear? Just to the west.

745
01:32:58,000 --> 01:32:59,525
Always.

746
01:32:59,560 --> 01:33:02,325
I can't leave 
you alone here.

747
01:33:02,360 --> 01:33:05,170
Yes, you can and you will do it ..

748
01:33:05,200 --> 01:33:08,199
Sorry, but I can not.

749
01:33:08,200 --> 01:33:11,204
Elsa, if you don't do it for yourself,
do it for the others.

750
01:33:13,800 --> 01:33:17,599
Go home, otherwise it
will all be in vain.

751
01:33:17,600 --> 01:33:20,888
Go back home!

752
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:28,604
Go!

753
01:34:26,280 --> 01:34:28,806
Go!

754
01:35:02,480 --> 01:35:04,799
Did you see how I get the girl !

755
01:35:04,800 --> 01:35:07,007
Like a playboy ! 

756
01:35:09,800 --> 01:35:12,531
I like her ...

757
01:35:13,520 --> 01:35:15,124
She can do it.

758
01:35:53,400 --> 01:35:55,801
I'll go home!

759
01:35:59,680 --> 01:36:01,045
I'll be back!

760
01:36:01,680 --> 01:36:04,889
Anyway you're all dead!

761
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:16,082
<i>Day-11</i>

762
01:37:26,600 --> 01:37:28,762
<i>Day-12 </i>

763
01:37:30,520 --> 01:37:33,569
Admiral! 
 Yes?

764
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:36,162
She's still alive!

765
01:37:42,200 --> 01:37:43,599
Tonight you'll be in Paris.

766
01:37:43,600 --> 01:37:44,965
I don't want to leave Kabul.

767
01:37:45,000 --> 01:37:46,650
Be reasonable,
it's for your health!

768
01:37:46,680 --> 01:37:48,842
I will fly nowhere while they are not found.

769
01:37:48,880 --> 01:37:52,566
This people are there to take care of you 
in a military hospital.

770
01:37:55,120 --> 01:37:56,451
Excuse me, please!

771
01:37:56,480 --> 01:38:00,007
Please ... Excuse me ...

772
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:09,764
Want to ride!
 Yes!

773
01:38:09,800 --> 01:38:12,531
Admiral, what are you doing ?
Just a stroll and we will be back!

774
01:38:16,400 --> 01:38:17,765
Admiral!

775
01:38:17,800 --> 01:38:20,644
Yes, I know, Mr. Minister.

776
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:25,126
Thank you.

777
01:38:25,160 --> 01:38:26,241
For what?

778
01:38:26,280 --> 01:38:30,365
That was my job to find you.

779
01:40:54,720 --> 01:40:56,759
<i>In memory of Benjamin,
Jonathan</i>

780
01:40:56,760 --> 01:40:58,808
<i> and other French soldiers
killed in Afghanistan</i>

781
01:40:59,280 --> 01:41:01,279
<i> And 
for brave reporters,</i>

782
01:41:01,280 --> 01:41:04,409
<i> that they sacrificed their lives around the world
to inform us.</i>
