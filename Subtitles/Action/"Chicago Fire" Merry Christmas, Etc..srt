00:09:06,298 --> 00:09:08,133
He's like a harmless little puppy dog.

182
00:09:08,167 --> 00:09:11,769
Yeah, a puppy dog with a
little wolf blood in him.

183
00:09:11,804 --> 00:09:13,888
- Hey, what's up, Chief?
- Hey, Chief.

184
00:09:13,939 --> 00:09:15,840
Sit.

185
00:09:15,858 --> 00:09:19,727
Uh, Chief, is this about
the diamond necklace

186
00:09:19,778 --> 00:09:22,063
Dawson stole at the residence...

187
00:09:22,114 --> 00:09:23,398
Hey.

188
00:09:23,449 --> 00:09:24,782
Someone from another shift apparently

189
00:09:24,817 --> 00:09:27,485
just told your field chief
that sometime in November,

190
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:29,954
four units of toradol
went missing from your rig

191
00:09:29,989 --> 00:09:31,239
during your shift.

192
00:09:31,290 --> 00:09:35,493
What? Who's saying this?
I bet you it was Lowell.

193
00:09:35,462 --> 00:09:37,597
Don't you worry about who said it.

194
00:09:37,631 --> 00:09:39,015
And why are they waiting
till now to say anything?

195
00:09:39,049 --> 00:09:40,266
That's probably because
they heard I.A.D. is

196
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:42,185
sniffing around our house.

197
00:09:42,236 --> 00:09:43,770
They want to cast the
blame if any more narcotics

198
00:09:43,804 --> 00:09:45,638
turned up missing.

199
00:09:45,656 --> 00:09:47,473
You know some junky
probably stole it off the rig

200
00:09:47,491 --> 00:09:49,325
when we were busy saving his friend.

201
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:52,311
That may be so. But it's on you, Dawson.

202
00:09:57,334 --> 00:10:01,337
So the two of you knock
your heads together,

203
00:10:01,372 --> 00:10:02,839
get back to me with your official version

204
00:10:02,873 --> 00:10:04,958
about what happened by
the end of the shift.

205
00:10:04,992 --> 00:10:06,176
Yeah, we'll figure it out, Chief.

206
00:10:06,210 --> 00:10:09,662
You better.

207
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:12,665
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

208
00:10:14,385 --> 00:10:15,635
We saved this lady's house.

209
00:10:15,669 --> 00:10:17,003
Where does she come off
accusing us of stealing...

210
00:10:17,021 --> 00:10:19,189
It's not like it's without precedent.

211
00:10:19,223 --> 00:10:22,809
Back in the day, I worked
with Pat "The Pinch" Osbourne.

212
00:10:22,843 --> 00:10:24,811
Had fingers like flypaper.

213
00:10:24,845 --> 00:10:27,180
The roof could be caving in on us,

214
00:10:27,198 --> 00:10:30,683
and Pat would take a moment
to rescue the silverware.

215
00:10:30,701 --> 00:10:34,954
So... what's the deal with the Lieutenant

216
00:10:34,989 --> 00:10:36,239
and the guy from I.A.D.?

217
00:10:36,290 --> 00:10:39,542
Bad history. They went
through the academy together.

218
00:10:39,577 --> 00:10:42,695
- And... there was an incident.
- What kind of incident?

219
00:10:42,713 --> 00:10:43,913
The kind that ends with Griffin

220
00:10:43,964 --> 00:10:45,465
getting his face punched in.

221
00:10:45,499 --> 00:10:47,467
Wait, why did the Lieutenant hit him?

222
00:10:47,501 --> 00:10:50,086
He was talking trash about Casey's family.

223
00:10:50,137 --> 00:10:53,473
Um, but, see...

224
00:10:53,507 --> 00:10:55,541
we don't talk about that.

225
00:10:55,559 --> 00:10:57,760
Whoa, whoa, whoa, guys, here we go.

226
00:10:57,811 --> 00:10:59,846
Here we go!

227
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:02,315
Hey, Lieutenant.

228
00:11:02,349 --> 00:11:03,933
Lieutenant, check this out.

229
00:11:03,984 --> 00:11:06,019
The people with all the artwork...

230
00:11:06,053 --> 00:11:08,438
Sandra and Richard Vaughan...

231
00:11:08,489 --> 00:11:10,607
they're selling their entire
art collection at auction.

232
00:11:10,658 --> 00:11:12,075
I already finished my Christmas shopping.

233
00:11:12,109 --> 00:11:14,027
No, no, no, no. Think about it.

234
00:11:14,061 --> 00:11:15,778
You don't sell your art collection.

235
00:11:15,829 --> 00:11:17,947
<i>Your children sell your art collection</i>

236
00:11:17,998 --> 00:11:19,666
after you die, or...

237
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:22,335
you sell it if you need the money.

238
00:11:22,369 --> 00:11:24,037
- Otis, I have things to do.
- The diamond necklace...

239
00:11:24,071 --> 00:11:27,707
it's an insurance scam.

240
00:11:27,741 --> 00:11:31,544
So this woman nearly burned down her home

241
00:11:31,578 --> 00:11:34,297
in some elaborate scheme
to get firefighters in there

242
00:11:34,348 --> 00:11:36,015
so she could accuse 'em
of stealing a necklace?

243
00:11:36,050 --> 00:11:37,884
No. She didn't set the fire.

244
00:11:37,918 --> 00:11:42,105
But when it happened, she
saw an opportunity to cash in.

245
00:11:42,139 --> 00:11:45,591
Yeah. You should write that down.

246
00:11:45,609 --> 00:11:49,229
[Sighs] Okay, I will.

247
00:11:51,699 --> 00:11:53,733
- All right.
- Shay, your ride's here.

248
00:11:53,767 --> 00:11:55,118
There you go. Thanks.

249
00:11:55,152 --> 00:11:57,237
- Great.
- Yeah.

250
00:11:57,271 --> 00:11:58,705
[Chuckles] You going to the prom, Hermann?

251
00:11:58,739 --> 00:12:02,742
Hey, this is the flagship
for Caesar limousine.

252
00:12:02,776 --> 00:12:05,161
- Your chariot awaits, ma'am.
- Ooh.

253
00:12:05,212 --> 00:12:08,248
This guy, he's liquidating his company.

254
00:12:08,282 --> 00:12:10,416
I can only afford one vehicle to start,

255
00:12:10,450 --> 00:12:13,002
but I figure I roll the profits
of this one into the next,

256
00:12:13,053 --> 00:12:14,587
and then the next, and before you know it,

257
00:12:14,621 --> 00:12:16,622
I have a whole fleet.

258
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:18,258
Airport runs, weddings, prom season.

259
00:12:18,292 --> 00:12:20,960
- Really, Hermann?
- Hey...

260
00:12:20,978 --> 00:12:22,512
I was smart enough to bring my own mechanic

261
00:12:22,563 --> 00:12:24,514
to the negotiations.

262
00:12:24,565 --> 00:12:27,600
Severide got the guy to
knock $1,500 off the price.

263
00:12:27,634 --> 00:12:28,818
You're gonna have to
spend some of that money

264
00:12:28,852 --> 00:12:30,636
to fix this charging issue.

265
00:12:30,654 --> 00:12:32,805
And you definitely need
to replace the timing belt.

266
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:38,995
And I thought I replaced
every vial I gave you,

267
00:12:39,029 --> 00:12:41,531
but I must have lost count.

268
00:12:41,582 --> 00:12:44,033
Hey. How can they bust
you for something that

269
00:12:44,084 --> 00:12:45,251
somebody said happened a month ago?

270
00:12:45,286 --> 00:12:47,003
It's their word against yours.

271
00:12:47,037 --> 00:12:48,371
If it were my ass on the
line, I'd put up a fight.

272
00:12:48,422 --> 00:12:50,156
But Dawson's the P.I.C.
It's her ass on the line.

273
00:12:50,174 --> 00:12:52,325
Well, I don't know what to tell you.

274
00:12:57,047 --> 00:12:59,932
No, you're right.

275
00:12:59,967 --> 00:13:02,969
It's not your problem.
You got what you needed.

276
00:13:03,003 --> 00:13:05,555
That... Shay.

277
00:13:05,606 --> 00:13:07,390
Shay.

278
00:13:07,441 --> 00:13:09,309
[Station alarm blares]

279
00:13:09,343 --> 00:13:11,177
Truck 81, ambulance 61...

280
00:13:11,195 --> 00:13:12,979
Capp, move this thing, will you?

281
00:13:13,013 --> 00:13:14,864
You got it.

282
00:13:18,202 --> 00:13:21,037
[Engine sputtering]

283
00:13:21,071 --> 00:13:22,872
Oh, please, please start.

284
00:13:22,906 --> 00:13:26,492
[Engine starts]

285
00:13:26,526 --> 00:13:27,827
- Yes!
- Be advised.

286
00:13:27,861 --> 00:13:29,712
Reports of multiple gunshot
victims, Humboldt Park.

287
00:13:29,747 --> 00:13:32,749
Humboldt Park. As predicted.

288
00:13:36,887 --> 00:13:40,373
[Siren]

289
00:13:54,605 --> 00:13:57,106
Everybody back up. Give 'em some room.

290
00:13:57,157 --> 00:13:58,858
Hey, Shay, let's get a "C" collar on her.

291
00:13:58,892 --> 00:14:00,410
Get her in the back of
the ambo and start an IV.

292
00:14:00,444 --> 00:14:02,779
- Just the one?
- The other two are DOA.

293
00:14:02,830 --> 00:14:04,747
It was a drive-by vehicle to vehicle.

294
00:14:04,782 --> 00:14:07,233
Girl was hit by a stray.
Shooters are long gone.

295
00:14:07,251 --> 00:14:08,251
Check these two, just in case.

296
00:14:08,285 --> 00:14:09,869
I'm on it, Lieutenant.

297
00:14:34,144 --> 00:14:37,763
What color was it? The car, what color?

298
00:14:37,781 --> 00:14:40,650
Was it an SUV, a Sedan... what?

299
00:14:40,701 --> 00:14:42,201
Hey, come on, man, my partner heard you say

300
00:14:42,236 --> 00:14:43,319
you saw the other car.

301
00:14:43,370 --> 00:14:44,570
Not really.

302
00:14:44,604 --> 00:14:47,740
I mean, it all happened so fast, man.

303
00:15:05,086 --> 00:15:07,086
- Yo.
- Yo?

304
00:15:07,087 --> 00:15:09,672
Leon, I left you, like, four messages.

305
00:15:09,723 --> 00:15:11,724
- Busy day.
- Yeah, no kidding.

306
00:15:11,758 --> 00:15:13,926
We just got a call on a
drive-by on Pulaski and Augusta,

307
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:17,229
and your boy Flaco was behind it.

308
00:15:17,264 --> 00:15:20,015
Yo, can I call you later?

309
00:15:20,067 --> 00:15:22,134
Are you with him right now?

310
00:15:22,152 --> 00:15:25,271
Mm-hmm.

311
00:15:25,305 --> 00:15:27,189
It don't matter. I'm gonna do the talking.

312
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:30,409
There's gonna be retaliation,
Leon, and I know you know that.

313
00:15:30,444 --> 00:15:32,611
You gotta put some daylight
between you and Flaco.

314
00:15:32,645 --> 00:15:35,647
[Locker shuts]

315
00:15:39,586 --> 00:15:42,872
Listen, Leon...

316
00:15:42,923 --> 00:15:45,091
I know you think you don't
got a way out of this life,

317
00:15:45,125 --> 00:15:46,675
but you do.

318
00:15:46,710 --> 00:15:48,327
I can help you.

319
00:15:48,345 --> 00:15:52,515
Not right this minute,
but I can help you get out.

320
00:15:52,549 --> 00:15:54,767
Just say the word.

321
00:15:54,801 --> 00:15:57,836
You want my help, just say so.

322
00:16:01,725 --> 00:16:04,110
So.

323
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:10,015
There you go, sweetie.
Get in there. Have a seat.

324
00:16:10,050 --> 00:16:14,353
You're gonna catch a cold out here.

325
00:16:14,371 --> 00:16:15,704
[Sighs]

326
00:16:15,739 --> 00:16:18,374
Okay, James, I'm gonna
take your blood pressure.

327
00:16:18,408 --> 00:16:20,376
- Is that okay?
- Will it hurt?

328
00:16:20,410 --> 00:16:22,361
I do it every time, and you always ask me

329
00:16:22,379 --> 00:16:24,380
- if it's gonna hurt.
- You never know.

330
00:16:26,166 --> 00:16:28,217
I don't know, it's just
too soon to ask Casey.

331
00:16:28,251 --> 00:16:29,251
This isn't the first time

332
00:16:29,302 --> 00:16:30,669
his relationship with hallie flatlined.

333
00:16:30,703 --> 00:16:32,805
And if it somehow gets revived again,

334
00:16:32,839 --> 00:16:34,807
and she finds out that
I asked him on a date...

335
00:16:34,841 --> 00:16:37,176
Won't you regret it if
you don't ask him, though?

336
00:16:37,210 --> 00:16:39,061
[Sighs] It's gotta be Mills.

337
00:16:39,095 --> 00:16:42,231
He's just the more appropriate choice.

338
00:16:42,265 --> 00:16:44,016
I guess you're right.

339
00:16:44,050 --> 00:16:46,352
Oh, for your dress, there's
this new shop on damen.

340
00:16:46,386 --> 00:16:47,570
No way.

341
00:16:47,604 --> 00:16:48,938
I sprained my credit
card Christmas shopping.

342
00:16:48,989 --> 00:16:51,723
I'll just recycle something.

343
00:16:51,741 --> 00:16:55,494
Oh, 110 over 60! James...
you're like a triathlete.

344
00:16:55,529 --> 00:16:57,163
You're good to go,
sweetie. We'll take you in

345
00:16:57,197 --> 00:16:58,414
and get you your meds, okay?

346
00:16:58,448 --> 00:17:00,866
Oh, James, that reminds me.

347
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:03,869
Did you steal any
toradol from us last time?

348
00:17:03,903 --> 00:17:07,840
I'm totally kidding. [Laughs]

349
00:17:10,927 --> 00:17:13,262
Give me a minute.

350
00:17:22,088 --> 00:17:24,023
Quick question. [Clears throat]

351
00:17:24,057 --> 00:17:26,141
Saturday... what are you doing?

352
00:17:26,193 --> 00:17:28,777
Depends. What do you got?

353
00:17:28,812 --> 00:17:31,096
Um, my cousin, the poster child

354
00:17:31,114 --> 00:17:32,648

355
00:17:32,699 --> 00:17:34,867
throws this really super-fancy
Christmas party every year.

356
00:17:34,901 --> 00:17:36,785
String quartet, plum pudding,

357
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:38,954
nutmeg sprinkled on the eggnog.

358
00:17:38,989 --> 00:17:40,456
It's so perfect you want to vomit.

359
00:17:40,490 --> 00:17:44,293
Sounds awesome. And you need a date?

360
00:17:44,327 --> 00:17:46,962
Yeah. I mean, I just need a friend

361
00:17:46,997 --> 00:17:48,347
to bring along, really.

362
00:17:48,381 --> 00:17:53,836
Oh. Then maybe you should ask Mouch.

363
00:17:53,887 --> 00:17:56,422
If you're up for a date,

364
00:17:56,456 --> 00:17:57,923
tell me what time to pick you up.

365
00:17:57,957 --> 00:18:00,392
7:00?

366
00:18:00,427 --> 00:18:02,561
Great.

367
00:18:07,567 --> 00:18:11,470
Yeah, I need a new dress.

368
00:18:11,488 --> 00:18:13,405
Chief, are you just gonna
let these pretend cops

369
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:14,907
violate our civil rights?

370
00:18:14,941 --> 00:18:17,359
Yeah, don't they need to show
us a warrant or something?

371
00:18:17,410 --> 00:18:18,661
They are well within their authority

372
00:18:18,695 --> 00:18:19,778
to search firehouse property.

373
00:18:19,812 --> 00:18:21,030
Even our personal lockers?

374
00:18:21,081 --> 00:18:22,665
You mean the department's lockers.

375
00:18:22,699 --> 00:18:24,783
Besides, it shouldn't bother you

376
00:18:24,817 --> 00:18:26,619
if you're not hiding something.

377
00:18:26,653 --> 00:18:29,121
Griffin, can I have a moment with you?

378
00:18:29,155 --> 00:18:32,708
Locker room, guys. Come on.

379
00:18:37,881 --> 00:18:40,666
What? You want to punch me again?

380
00:18:40,684 --> 00:18:44,720
When's the last time I.A.D.
searched an entire house?

381
00:18:44,771 --> 00:18:47,773
A firefighter stole a $50,000 necklace,

382
00:18:47,807 --> 00:18:49,391
and it's my job to find out who.

383
00:18:49,442 --> 00:18:51,310
But don't blame me if you suddenly regret

384
00:18:51,344 --> 00:18:52,778
assaulting a fellow classmate.

385
00:18:52,812 --> 00:18:55,447
Regret it? I'm glad I did it.

386
00:18:55,482 --> 00:18:58,400
You weren't the first idiot to
make a crack about my family.

387
00:18:58,451 --> 00:19:00,119
You're the last.

388
00:19:00,153 --> 00:19:02,454
No one's brought it up again
since I laid your ass out.

389
00:19:02,489 --> 00:19:04,123
- Sucker punched.
- You saw it coming.

390
00:19:04,157 --> 00:19:06,408
<i>The only ones who saw it were your buddies.</i>

391
00:19:06,459 --> 00:19:09,545
None of whom had the integrity
to say what really happened.

392
00:19:13,633 --> 00:19:15,884
By the way... how is your mom?

393
00:19:19,139 --> 00:19:20,923
Hey! Hey!

394
00:19:20,974 --> 00:19:22,975
Oh, whoa, whoa.

395
00:19:23,009 --> 00:19:24,727
Casey blood sure runs hot, don't it?

396
00:19:24,761 --> 00:19:27,346
Do your job.

397
00:19:33,729 --> 00:19:36,280
Remember that one call we
went on at D and University?

398
00:19:36,331 --> 00:19:37,731
- Which one?
- We got a block away,

399
00:19:37,749 --> 00:19:39,867
and we realized the jump
bag was sitting on the curb.

400
00:19:39,901 --> 00:19:41,702
I think that's when the vials went missing.

401
00:19:43,672 --> 00:19:46,040
Damn, girl, you wear that
dress, I'll be your date.

402
00:19:46,074 --> 00:19:47,574
I don't know. I feel kind of naked.

403
00:19:47,593 --> 00:19:49,710
It's perfect.

404
00:19:49,744 --> 00:19:51,095
Excuse me. Ring this up.

405
00:19:51,129 --> 00:19:54,181
Oh, no, I need to think
about this one for a minute.

406
00:19:54,216 --> 00:19:56,717
Thank you.

407
00:19:56,751 --> 00:19:58,269
Is everything okay?

408
00:19:58,303 --> 00:20:00,254
Yeah. Why?

409
00:20:00,272 --> 00:20:03,024
You seem more worked up over
this toradol thing than I am.

410
00:20:03,058 --> 00:20:05,059
No, I'm not worried.

411
00:20:05,093 --> 00:20:07,395
Ambo 61, what is your location?

412
00:20:07,429 --> 00:20:09,814
Ambulance 61. We're at Armitage and Damen.

413
00:20:09,865 --> 00:20:12,266
Take in a working fire.
1100 block North Hamlin.

414
00:20:12,284 --> 00:20:15,820
Okay, I'll take the other one.

House fire, 1100 block...

418
00:20:25,947 --> 00:20:28,115
This house was supposed
to be taken out of service.

419
00:20:28,133 --> 00:20:31,502
You never made that request.

420
00:20:31,553 --> 00:20:34,338
So now you guys are
gonna have to sit tight...

421
00:20:34,389 --> 00:20:36,474
until these men get back.

[Siren blaring]

425
00:21:04,419 --> 00:21:08,289
This is Battalion Chief
Boden at 1140 North Hamlin.

426
00:21:08,323 --> 00:21:11,325
We responded to a call of a
gang shooting into the building.

427
00:21:11,343 --> 00:21:13,294
They torched it and
fled before we got here.

428
00:21:13,328 --> 00:21:15,179
Who's inside? Another gang? Any civilians?

429
00:21:15,213 --> 00:21:17,098
You know as much as I do.

430
00:21:17,132 --> 00:21:18,466
Could be gang members inside.

431
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:19,717
I count six mailboxes.

432
00:21:19,768 --> 00:21:21,018
That fire has reached the structure.

433
00:21:21,053 --> 00:21:22,687
Help me!

00:21:22,721 --> 00:21:25,690

00:37:47,718 --> 00:37:49,969
Somebody's gotta be up
there looking out for me.

715
00:37:55,308 --> 00:37:57,977
Joe, you okay?

716
00:37:58,028 --> 00:38:02,198
I can't.

717
00:38:02,232 --> 00:38:04,734
I can't do this. I can't do this.

718
00:38:04,768 --> 00:38:07,319
I...

719
00:38:07,371 --> 00:38:10,740
[Breathing unsteadily]

720
00:38:20,307 --> 00:38:22,775
You're up early.

721
00:38:30,617 --> 00:38:33,786
You know I love you, right?

722
00:38:33,820 --> 00:38:39,608
Okay, what's going on?

723
00:38:39,626 --> 00:38:41,577
I love you because I know
you'd stick your neck out for me

724
00:38:41,611 --> 00:38:42,795
the way I have for you.

725
00:38:42,829 --> 00:38:45,381
Of course I would.

726
00:38:45,415 --> 00:38:46,949
And I did that to get you over the hump.

727
00:38:46,967 --> 00:38:49,051
Which you totally did.

728
00:38:49,085 --> 00:38:54,890
And then I found these in the trash.

729
00:38:54,925 --> 00:38:57,977
Those are ol... they're old.

730
00:39:00,296 --> 00:39:02,681
I perjured myself for you, Kelly.

731
00:39:02,732 --> 00:39:06,468
Shay...

732
00:39:06,486 --> 00:39:08,187
I'm out.

733
00:39:08,238 --> 00:39:10,072
Whoa, whoa, whoa. What do you mean?

734
00:39:10,106 --> 00:39:13,659
I mean I'm out. We had a deal...

735
00:39:13,693 --> 00:39:15,327
we wouldn't get in each other's business,

736
00:39:15,362 --> 00:39:17,863
but I can't hold up my end.

737
00:39:17,914 --> 00:39:19,331
So I'm out.

738
00:39:19,366 --> 00:39:22,034
Shay, it's okay. I got it.

739
00:39:22,085 --> 00:39:25,153
<i>- I got it.
- No, you don't got it!</i>

740
00:39:25,171 --> 00:39:28,991
I'm not gonna sit here and watch you...

741
00:39:29,009 --> 00:39:32,845
just fool yourself.

742
00:39:32,879 --> 00:39:36,098
I'll get the rest of my stuff later.

743
00:39:36,132 --> 00:39:39,001
Shay, hey, please don't go.

744
00:39:39,019 --> 00:39:41,186
Please don't... please don't do this.

745
00:39:41,221 --> 00:39:44,773
[Door opens, shuts]

746
00:39:47,978 --> 00:39:51,063
[Breathing unsteadily]

747
00:39:54,034 --> 00:39:55,734
[Cell phone vibrates]

748
00:40:05,045 --> 00:40:06,462
This is Matt Casey.

749
00:40:06,496 --> 00:40:07,997
Leave it here and I'll call you back.

750
00:40:08,031 --> 00:40:10,499
Lieutenant, it's Joe Cruz.

751
00:40:10,533 --> 00:40:14,586
Um... Casey, man, I need to talk to you.

752
00:40:17,841 --> 00:40:23,429
It's really important. I, uh...

753
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:25,848
I, um...

754
00:40:38,111 --> 00:40:39,378
[Whistle blowing]

755
00:40:39,312 --> 00:40:40,646
Here we go.

756
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:42,648
I'll make my brother get the
rest of your stuff tomorrow.

757
00:40:42,682 --> 00:40:44,299
And you are totally welcome to stay with me

758
00:40:44,317 --> 00:40:45,517
as long as you want.

759
00:40:45,569 --> 00:40:48,153
Thanks.

760
00:40:48,188 --> 00:40:50,806
You gonna tell me what he did?

761
00:40:50,824 --> 00:40:54,193
No. You gonna tell me how your date went?

762
00:40:54,244 --> 00:40:57,413
Nope. He's good.

763
00:40:57,447 --> 00:40:58,697
Thank you.

764
00:40:58,748 --> 00:41:01,533
[Dispatch chatter over radio]

765
00:41:01,568 --> 00:41:03,535
Come on, give me something.

766

[Chuckles]

767
00:41:05,088 --> 00:41:06,872
Well, I was right about Casey.

768
00:41:06,923 --> 00:41:08,457
He's still into Hallie.

769
00:41:08,491 --> 00:41:09,792
And I'm an idiot.

770
00:41:09,826 --> 00:41:12,544
[Whistle blows]

771
00:41:12,596 --> 00:41:15,330
[Door buzzer]

772
00:41:30,530 --> 00:41:33,565
Hi, mom.

773
00:41:36,903 --> 00:41:38,570
Tomorrow night, you and me are gonna have

774
00:41:38,622 --> 00:41:40,706
- a few margaritas.
- Heh!

775
00:41:40,740 --> 00:41:42,041
A few pitchers, you mean.

776
00:41:42,075 --> 00:41:43,692
Yeah, well, that was implied.

777
