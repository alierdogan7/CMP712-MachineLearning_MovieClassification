1
00:00:00,315 --> 00:00:02,069
My name is Stephen Jameson.

2
00:00:02,101 --> 00:00:03,876
I'm one of the Tomorrow People.

3
00:00:03,908 --> 00:00:06,134
They call our powers the three T's.

4
00:00:06,145 --> 00:00:07,398
- Telepathy...
- Stephen?

5
00:00:07,436 --> 00:00:08,437
Telekinesis...

6
00:00:08,468 --> 00:00:09,895
And teleportation.

7
00:00:10,015 --> 00:00:13,166
There is a shadow war going
on between us and Ultra...

8
00:00:13,179 --> 00:00:15,400
- No!
- ... the secret organization that hunts us.

9
00:00:15,437 --> 00:00:17,984
The only way to keep my
species from going extinct

10
00:00:18,028 --> 00:00:19,567
is to find my father.

11
00:00:19,617 --> 00:00:22,801
And the only way to do that
is by working for the enemy.

12
00:00:23,727 --> 00:00:25,470
Previously on The Tomorrow People...

13
00:00:26,975 --> 00:00:29,335
Julian is a nihilist.

14
00:00:29,337 --> 00:00:30,353
An anarchist.

15
00:00:30,355 --> 00:00:31,638
You know this guy?

16
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:33,289
Our paths crossed when
I first got into town.

17
00:00:33,291 --> 00:00:35,225
We didn't part on the best terms.

18
00:00:35,810 --> 00:00:37,176
We do not torture people.

19
00:00:37,178 --> 00:00:38,645
I'm not going anywhere.

20
00:00:39,196 --> 00:00:40,864
New York is mine, bitch.

21
00:00:45,268 --> 00:00:47,787
You overrode my leadership
in front of everyone.

22
00:00:47,815 --> 00:00:50,540
I am gonna do what I think
is best for our people.

23
00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:53,326
This attitude of yours is
dangerous for all of us.

24
00:00:53,333 --> 00:00:57,747
If you're gonna threaten to kick me
out every time I step out of line,

25
00:00:57,749 --> 00:00:59,215
you should just do it already.

26
00:00:59,217 --> 00:01:01,701
Pack your stuff. You need to go.

27
00:01:16,984 --> 00:01:18,184
Sir!

28
00:01:38,011 --> 00:01:41,174
- He's down. He's down. You all right?
- Clear!

29
00:01:51,218 --> 00:01:52,886
Made you some breakfast.

30
00:01:53,206 --> 00:01:54,971
Oh, thanks sweetheart.

31
00:01:56,023 --> 00:01:58,308
Can't a guy make breakfast for another guy?

32
00:01:58,643 --> 00:02:01,060
I figure I got to earn my
keep around here somehow.

33
00:02:01,062 --> 00:02:02,278
Mmm-hmm.

34
00:02:03,185 --> 00:02:05,064
Damn. That's really good.

35
00:02:05,066 --> 00:02:06,282
It's the bread.

36
00:02:06,284 --> 00:02:08,785
You gotta let it go stale
to make French toast.

37
00:02:08,816 --> 00:02:10,523
Saw it on a TV show.

38
00:02:10,974 --> 00:02:13,960
Well, as nice as it is to see you
tapping into your domestic side,

39
00:02:14,341 --> 00:02:16,963
you're avoiding dealing with Cara.
You can't live like this forever.

40
00:02:16,965 --> 00:02:19,299
Look, if I'm in the way, just say the word.

41
00:02:19,301 --> 00:02:20,550
It's not that.

42
00:02:20,552 --> 00:02:22,085
Our people need you.

43
00:02:22,117 --> 00:02:24,304
Maybe they're better off without me.

44
00:02:24,670 --> 00:02:26,089
Cara kicked me out, remember?

45
00:02:26,091 --> 00:02:27,974
And then she asked you to
come back, and you said no.

46
00:02:27,976 --> 00:02:29,400
You want to know what I think?

47
00:02:29,418 --> 00:02:30,642
- Not especially.
- Too bad.

48
00:02:30,688 --> 00:02:32,896
You're both being too
stubborn to just let it go.

49
00:02:32,898 --> 00:02:34,180
Face each other.

50
00:02:34,182 --> 00:02:36,150
Look, you're welcome to stay
here as long as you want.

51
00:02:36,151 --> 00:02:37,216
But you belong with them.

52
00:02:37,218 --> 00:02:38,401
And with Cara.

53
00:02:40,437 --> 00:02:43,765
I don't mean, like, "With Cara."

54
00:02:44,003 --> 00:02:45,057
With Cara, I just meant...

55
00:02:45,059 --> 00:02:46,109
I know what you meant.

56
00:02:46,111 --> 00:02:47,610
Cook her some breakfast.

57
00:02:47,612 --> 00:02:49,496
Your French toast is ridiculous.

58
00:02:56,921 --> 00:02:58,087
Hmmph.

59
00:03:05,513 --> 00:03:07,180
Are you there, John?

60
00:03:07,848 --> 00:03:09,048
Are you busy?

61
00:03:09,517 --> 00:03:10,967
Hardly.

62
00:03:12,386 --> 00:03:14,767
So how is everything?

63
00:03:15,161 --> 00:03:17,440
- Good, I suppose.

64
00:03:18,592 --> 00:03:20,560
But you're probably
asking about Cara, right?

65
00:03:20,562 --> 00:03:22,145
No, I was not.

66
00:03:22,863 --> 00:03:24,614
But since you brought her up.

67
00:03:25,065 --> 00:03:26,232
How is she?

68
00:03:26,234 --> 00:03:27,984
She's not the same without you.

69
00:03:27,986 --> 00:03:30,069
This whole place isn't the same.

70
00:03:30,771 --> 00:03:31,921
So when are you coming back?

71
00:03:31,923 --> 00:03:33,573
I don't know yet, Charlotte.

72
00:03:33,923 --> 00:03:36,442
If you don't come back soon,
I'm going to hate you forever.

73
00:03:37,928 --> 00:03:39,712
I miss you too, Charlie.

74
00:03:40,881 --> 00:03:42,248
Who you talking to?

75
00:03:42,917 --> 00:03:44,100
No one.

76
00:03:44,952 --> 00:03:46,586
So how is John, anyway?

77
00:03:48,155 --> 00:03:49,505
It's okay.

78
00:03:49,957 --> 00:03:51,174
I miss him too.

79
00:03:51,176 --> 00:03:53,042
Then why don't you let him come back home?

80
00:03:53,044 --> 00:03:56,429
Charlotte, I can't force him to come
back if he wants to be on his own.

81
00:03:56,431 --> 00:03:57,647
Why not?

82
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:00,149
You're in charge, right?

83
00:04:00,151 --> 00:04:02,435
It doesn't work that way down here.

84
00:04:03,854 --> 00:04:06,406
You can't bring someone
in unless they're ready.

85
00:04:59,936 --> 00:05:02,194
Hey, what the hell are you doing?

86
00:05:04,798 --> 00:05:06,666
I believe this belongs to me.

87
00:05:08,302 --> 00:05:11,170
And what do you need a
cell phone for, anyway?

88
00:05:11,639 --> 00:05:12,839
You're telepathic.

89
00:05:12,841 --> 00:05:14,223
Cara.

90
00:05:15,225 --> 00:05:17,310
- How do you know my name?
- I read your mind.

91
00:05:17,312 --> 00:05:18,478
You're crazy.

92
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:25,234
You need to listen to me very carefully.

93
00:05:25,938 --> 00:05:28,855
There is a place for people
like us where you'll be safe.

94
00:05:28,857 --> 00:05:31,107
Off the streets, and away from Ultra.

95
00:05:32,526 --> 00:05:34,027
So you've heard of them.

96
00:05:34,394 --> 00:05:35,611
Good.

97
00:05:35,943 --> 00:05:37,730
How do I know I can trust you?

98
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,457
What's up?

99
00:05:48,644 --> 00:05:52,378
Um, what's up is you haven't
been in school in a week.

100
00:05:53,263 --> 00:05:54,597
Told you, I'm sick.

101
00:05:54,599 --> 00:05:55,557
You did.

102
00:05:56,027 --> 00:05:57,415
You look all right to me.

103
00:05:57,447 --> 00:05:59,218
Oh. What, are you a doctor now?

104
00:05:59,461 --> 00:06:00,894
Working for your

105
00:06:01,170 --> 00:06:02,659
crazy uncle?

106
00:06:03,529 --> 00:06:05,274
Okay, so that's what this is about.

107
00:06:05,276 --> 00:06:07,643
I fixed things with my uncle.

108
00:06:08,133 --> 00:06:09,973
No one will ever come after you.

109
00:06:10,093 --> 00:06:10,993
I promise.

110
00:06:11,030 --> 00:06:13,621
Sorry, I'm probably contagious,
I think you should go.

111
00:06:24,545 --> 00:06:27,113
Oh, Julian, Julian, Julian.

112
00:06:30,450 --> 00:06:32,468
I wish I could say I was surprised.

113
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:35,176
But, then again...

114
00:06:35,208 --> 00:06:37,840
All roads lead to Ultra
for your sort, don't they?

115
00:06:38,242 --> 00:06:41,274
I have to tell you, when I heard
you just popped in for a visit,

116
00:06:41,583 --> 00:06:44,510
at the most paranormally
secure building on the planet,

117
00:06:44,968 --> 00:06:47,313
I thought it was a little
bit too good to be true.

118
00:06:48,449 --> 00:06:50,116
But then again, here you are.

119
00:06:50,354 --> 00:06:51,918
Put down the damn needle.

120
00:06:51,943 --> 00:06:52,852
Why?

121
00:06:54,121 --> 00:06:56,289
You must suspect I got caught for a reason?

122
00:06:56,291 --> 00:06:58,741
I don't have time for games. I got nothing.

123
00:07:00,828 --> 00:07:02,128
I lost my crew.

124
00:07:02,546 --> 00:07:04,080
I lost my girl.

125
00:07:05,299 --> 00:07:07,050
This is no way to live.

126
00:07:07,327 --> 00:07:09,082
Being hunted like an animal.

127
00:07:09,202 --> 00:07:10,219
Go news.

128
00:07:10,221 --> 00:07:12,672
I take away your powers,
Ultra leaves you alone.

129
00:07:12,894 --> 00:07:15,785
You take away my powers, you're
giving up your white whale.

130
00:07:17,177 --> 00:07:18,561
Cara Coburn?

131
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:24,100
Her ragged group of rebels
living right beneath your feet?

132
00:07:24,685 --> 00:07:26,052
I can deliver them to you.

133
00:07:28,322 --> 00:07:30,144
If you'd rather give me the needle,

134
00:07:30,607 --> 00:07:32,021
let's get it over with.

135
00:07:38,056 --> 00:07:43,575
- synced and corrected by chamallow -
- www.addic7ed.com -

136
00:07:54,049 --> 00:07:56,545
We've got fresh food for three days.

137
00:07:56,583 --> 00:07:58,059
Canned goods to last us a week.

138
00:07:58,091 --> 00:08:00,105
Plus, we're running
low on medical supplies.

139
00:08:00,225 --> 00:08:03,965
Plus, we're out of the totally important
stuff like beer and gummy bears.

140
00:08:04,085 --> 00:08:05,400
I'm not talking about
that supermarket crap,

141
00:08:05,402 --> 00:08:08,001
I mean the good German ones. Der Gummi.

142
00:08:08,014 --> 00:08:10,372
Grab some people. We'll go
topside tonight for provisions.

143
00:08:10,374 --> 00:08:11,957
Can I come with you?

144
00:08:12,491 --> 00:08:13,625
I want to help.

145
00:08:13,627 --> 00:08:15,043
Not this time, honey.

146
00:08:15,163 --> 00:08:17,829
We need you to hold down
the fort until we get back.

147
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:25,637
- What's going on?
- Taking inventory.

148
00:08:25,639 --> 00:08:27,222
If you want to help out,
we could use the muscle.

149
00:08:27,224 --> 00:08:28,706
Someone's got to carry the keg.

150
00:08:28,708 --> 00:08:31,309
You know, it sounds like
you got it under control.

151
00:08:31,761 --> 00:08:33,044
Truth.

152
00:08:33,046 --> 00:08:35,146
You have this place spinning like a top.

153
00:08:35,648 --> 00:08:37,165
I came here with news.

154
00:08:37,549 --> 00:08:38,600
About Julian.

155
00:08:39,602 --> 00:08:42,009
Please, tell me he

156
00:08:42,129 --> 00:08:44,085
died tasting his own blood.

157
00:08:44,086 --> 00:08:46,324
Actually, he's at Ultra.

158
00:08:47,693 --> 00:08:49,494
I figured he fled the city.

159
00:08:49,935 --> 00:08:52,119
No one deserves the needle
more than that sick bastard.

160
00:08:52,150 --> 00:08:54,653
So, you're telling me when
I run into him on the street,

161
00:08:54,678 --> 00:08:56,036
he won't have powers?

162
00:08:57,174 --> 00:09:00,405
Should make our grudge
match a whole lot of fun.

163
00:09:00,597 --> 00:09:03,241
- Still jonesing for revenge, huh?
- You blame him?

164
00:09:03,669 --> 00:09:05,302
Russell's got reason to hate Julian.

165
00:09:05,521 --> 00:09:07,242
Almost as bad as he hates me.

166
00:09:07,254 --> 00:09:08,930
Well, you don't have to
worry about that anymore.

167
00:09:10,132 --> 00:09:11,383
Yeah.

168
00:09:12,268 --> 00:09:13,935
Thanks for the news.

169
00:09:21,677 --> 00:09:23,528
What are they doing here?

170
00:09:24,072 --> 00:09:26,125
I assume you're not gonna take my powers.

171
00:09:26,193 --> 00:09:27,598
Well, you assume correctly.

172
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,568
Then why am I still strapped down, when
I could be finding the Tomorrow People?

173
00:09:31,342 --> 00:09:32,400
Well,

174
00:09:33,438 --> 00:09:35,303
let's just say I don't want
to let you out of custody

175
00:09:35,334 --> 00:09:38,512
until I have an assurance that you're
going to deliver on your promise.

176
00:09:38,544 --> 00:09:41,746
Give me four men, and I'll bring you the
whole gang tied up in a neat little bow.

177
00:09:41,748 --> 00:09:45,166
And why should you succeed when
my best Ultra agents have failed?

178
00:09:47,470 --> 00:09:48,455
Because of that

179
00:09:48,517 --> 00:09:51,101
shifty little minx who's calling the shots.

180
00:09:52,508 --> 00:09:53,958
Cara.

181
00:09:54,430 --> 00:09:57,662
I taught her everything she knows
about surviving in this city.

182
00:09:58,246 --> 00:10:00,036
How to hide in plain sight.

183
00:10:00,055 --> 00:10:02,232
When and where to find supplies.

184
00:10:02,301 --> 00:10:04,128
If anybody can find her,

185
00:10:04,334 --> 00:10:05,435
it's me.

186
00:10:06,505 --> 00:10:08,106
How's that for an assurance?

187
00:10:08,226 --> 00:10:08,908
Hmm.

188
00:10:09,028 --> 00:10:10,672
Yeah, I'm not feeling it.

189
00:10:15,481 --> 00:10:16,665
Ahh!

190
00:10:19,972 --> 00:10:23,244
What I've just injected into
your sinus is an explosive charge.

191
00:10:23,364 --> 00:10:25,722
It's not huge, but it'll kill you.

192
00:10:25,734 --> 00:10:28,093
- I thought we had a deal.
- Oh, we do.

193
00:10:28,368 --> 00:10:30,345
I'm just making sure it
works out in my favor.

194
00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:31,930
So...

195
00:10:33,165 --> 00:10:35,795
That's going to go off in
18 hours unless I desarm it.

196
00:10:35,971 --> 00:10:38,235
What you do with that time
is of course up to you,

197
00:10:38,254 --> 00:10:40,394
but if you don't bring
Cara and her friends in...

198
00:10:41,738 --> 00:10:45,443
well, let's just say you won't have
to worry about that headache anymore.

199
00:11:14,924 --> 00:11:17,369
Aren't you supposed to be in school?

200
00:11:19,044 --> 00:11:21,563
Aren't you supposed to
be in your secret lair?

201
00:11:22,857 --> 00:11:24,408
Wearing clothes?

202
00:11:24,984 --> 00:11:27,485
Really though, why are
you in Stephen's room?

203
00:11:27,543 --> 00:11:29,514
Oh, just crashing for a bit.

204
00:11:29,989 --> 00:11:31,766
I just needed a break, that's all.

205
00:11:31,886 --> 00:11:33,724
Yeah, I know the feeling.

206
00:11:34,894 --> 00:11:36,478
Is that why you're skipping school?

207
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,317
I was actually hoping to talk to Stephen.

208
00:11:38,349 --> 00:11:39,697
Well, you got me.

209
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:40,865
You want to talk?

210
00:11:40,867 --> 00:11:43,284
Why are you suddenly so
interested in my life?

211
00:11:43,629 --> 00:11:45,437
Well, you did pull a bullet out of me.

212
00:11:46,005 --> 00:11:47,802
- A break from what?
- Hmm?

213
00:11:47,827 --> 00:11:49,958
The reason you're hiding out in
Stephen's room, you said you needed...

214
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:52,127
Hey, no, we're talking about you now.

215
00:11:52,129 --> 00:11:54,579
You want, uh, you want to
meet up at the noodle bar?

216
00:11:54,581 --> 00:11:55,847
Well...

217
00:11:55,849 --> 00:11:57,617
That's kind of the problem.

218
00:11:57,649 --> 00:12:00,128
I'm having a hard time
getting out of the house.

219
00:12:00,636 --> 00:12:02,253
I'll come to you then.

220
00:12:06,809 --> 00:12:09,027
- Hi.
- Hi.

221
00:12:10,529 --> 00:12:12,063
Nice house.

222
00:12:13,115 --> 00:12:14,449
Thanks.

223
00:12:16,984 --> 00:12:18,617
So, what's going on?

224
00:12:19,405 --> 00:12:20,955
Uh...

225
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:22,674
Stuff.

226
00:12:23,042 --> 00:12:24,818
Stuff. Hmm.

227
00:12:25,694 --> 00:12:26,961
Come on.

228
00:12:36,288 --> 00:12:37,806
I don't know, I'm...

229
00:12:39,125 --> 00:12:40,642
not really sleeping.

230
00:12:41,393 --> 00:12:42,677
Can't eat.

231
00:12:43,018 --> 00:12:45,330
Haven't left the house
since I got back to town.

232
00:12:45,332 --> 00:12:46,614
That makes sense.

233
00:12:47,248 --> 00:12:49,184
You were targeted by a hit squad.

234
00:12:49,451 --> 00:12:50,785
Twice.

235
00:12:51,189 --> 00:12:53,554
I mean, most people would
be total basket cases.

236
00:12:53,623 --> 00:12:54,980
Check.

237
00:12:55,412 --> 00:12:57,664
But you can't wear slippers
the rest of your life.

238
00:12:58,247 --> 00:12:59,631
I like these slippers.

239
00:12:59,633 --> 00:13:01,732
They're nice slippers,
but it's not what I meant.

240
00:13:04,086 --> 00:13:05,537
Truth is...

241
00:13:06,405 --> 00:13:08,495
I'm scared of being around Stephen.

242
00:13:09,108 --> 00:13:10,829
I know it's not his fault.

243
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:12,243
But now that I've seen those things...

244
00:13:12,249 --> 00:13:13,962
You can't unsee them.

245
00:13:15,534 --> 00:13:17,624
And now you're wondering how you

246
00:13:17,643 --> 00:13:19,050
even leave the house,

247
00:13:19,094 --> 00:13:21,352
knowing you could be in
the line of fire again.

248
00:13:22,022 --> 00:13:24,512
You know, I ask myself
the same thing every day.

249
00:13:24,756 --> 00:13:26,357
Hmm.

250
00:13:26,821 --> 00:13:28,848
And what do you have to be scared of?

251
00:13:29,728 --> 00:13:31,558
Anything bad comes along,

252
00:13:31,570 --> 00:13:32,965
you can teleport out.

253
00:13:33,866 --> 00:13:35,450
People like me,

254
00:13:35,781 --> 00:13:38,903
we die in car crashes and
we get struck by lightning.

255
00:13:39,938 --> 00:13:42,240
We can't run away from
the bad things out there.

256
00:13:42,707 --> 00:13:44,402
But, you take a leap of faith

257
00:13:44,446 --> 00:13:45,967
and you keep going anyway.

258
00:13:46,962 --> 00:13:48,630
And maybe I can help.

259
00:13:50,132 --> 00:13:51,332
How?

260
00:13:51,334 --> 00:13:52,783
First things first.

261
00:13:53,502 --> 00:13:55,170
We find you some shoes.

262
00:14:02,294 --> 00:14:03,561
Come on.

263
00:14:05,658 --> 00:14:08,173
I take it you've been
on your own for a while.

264
00:14:08,293 --> 00:14:10,401
Had a stint of living with others like us.

265
00:14:11,445 --> 00:14:14,298
Didn't exactly pan out, so I
figure better to rely on myself.

266
00:14:14,773 --> 00:14:16,608
I get that.

267
00:14:18,027 --> 00:14:20,078
But if I can find you,

268
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:21,779
Ultra can find you.

269
00:14:22,407 --> 00:14:24,616
We stand a better chance
of surviving together,

270
00:14:24,618 --> 00:14:25,950
then we do apart.

271
00:14:25,952 --> 00:14:27,418
Oh.

272
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:29,003
And you want to help me.

273
00:14:29,285 --> 00:14:31,923
Poor little damsel in distress,
out of the goodness of your heart.

274
00:14:32,476 --> 00:14:34,592
You're the best telepath I've ever met.

275
00:14:34,594 --> 00:14:36,327
You can help us find others.

276
00:14:36,329 --> 00:14:37,879
So you want to use me?

277
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:41,048
Maybe I'm not explaining myself right.

278
00:14:41,168 --> 00:14:44,001
Is that why you won't let
me inside your head, John?

279
00:14:44,452 --> 00:14:46,541
Don't want me to figure
out it's all a trap?

280
00:14:51,064 --> 00:14:53,649
Next time you want to recruit
a sweet, young telepath,

281
00:14:53,769 --> 00:14:56,114
don't corner her in an empty subway car.

282
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:15,850
Excuse me.

283
00:15:16,132 --> 00:15:17,863
What happened to the guy
that was in this room?

284
00:15:17,872 --> 00:15:19,220
He's already out in the field.

285
00:15:19,222 --> 00:15:22,302
Took agents out with him to go
after a group of paranormals.

286
00:15:29,239 --> 00:15:31,240
Right, now, remember, Tim's
taking care of security,

287
00:15:31,241 --> 00:15:33,902
but any sign of trouble, you drop
everything, we rendezvous back at the lair.

288
00:15:34,151 --> 00:15:36,979
Seriously, if I don't get my gummy
bears, I'm going to kill someone.

289
00:15:37,099 --> 00:15:38,393
All right, let's get moving.

290
00:15:43,228 --> 00:15:45,113
So many cold cuts,

291
00:15:45,115 --> 00:15:46,831
so little time.

292
00:16:13,309 --> 00:16:14,842
Hello, Cara.

293
00:16:22,330 --> 00:16:24,466
Figured you'd drag your rats here to refuel

294
00:16:24,467 --> 00:16:26,094
since I taught you about this place.

295
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:29,041
Easy in. Easy out.

296
00:16:29,371 --> 00:16:31,769
You always were a creature of habit.

297
00:16:33,041 --> 00:16:35,392
Go on. Juice her.

298
00:16:38,362 --> 00:16:40,398
Come on, Cara.

299
00:16:40,799 --> 00:16:42,475
I know you're still here.

300
00:16:42,707 --> 00:16:44,264
You wouldn't want to leave your poor,

301
00:16:44,308 --> 00:16:46,911
defenseless little friends alone with me.

302
00:16:47,756 --> 00:16:50,446
Russell, Ultra's here.

303
00:16:50,708 --> 00:16:52,307
Why aren't you answering me?

304
00:16:52,427 --> 00:16:53,727
Russell!

305
00:16:59,434 --> 00:17:00,717
Stephen.

306
00:17:01,886 --> 00:17:03,981
- We were ambushed.
- It's Julian.

307
00:17:04,025 --> 00:17:05,332
He's working with Ultra.

308
00:17:05,870 --> 00:17:07,866
If Julian is here,

309
00:17:07,929 --> 00:17:09,199
let's roll the son of a bitch.

310
00:17:09,230 --> 00:17:11,927
Hey. Free the others and get
out of here, I gotta find Cara.

311
00:17:11,945 --> 00:17:13,384
- But...
- I know, I know.

312
00:17:13,564 --> 00:17:14,698
Revenge can wait, Russell.

313
00:17:25,677 --> 00:17:27,244
I'm not in the mood for hide and seek.

314
00:17:38,959 --> 00:17:40,794
Why postpone the inevitable?

315
00:17:46,601 --> 00:17:48,082
We gotta get out of here.

316
00:17:48,391 --> 00:17:49,942
Everybody cool to teleport?

317
00:18:13,444 --> 00:18:14,694
You okay?

318
00:18:18,479 --> 00:18:19,724
What are you doing here?

319
00:18:19,749 --> 00:18:21,288
I'm an Ultra agent, remember?

320
00:18:21,408 --> 00:18:23,178
Got a call you needed backup.

321
00:18:25,005 --> 00:18:26,089
Fine.

322
00:18:26,431 --> 00:18:27,907
Help load the prisoners.

323
00:18:37,655 --> 00:18:39,670
My uncle's not gonna like that.

324
00:18:48,492 --> 00:18:51,777
Okay, look. If this is some
kind of exposure therapy,

325
00:18:51,821 --> 00:18:52,615
I get it.

326
00:18:53,451 --> 00:18:55,318
Public transportation is terrifying.

327
00:18:55,953 --> 00:18:58,271
Not nearly terrifying enough.

328
00:19:03,483 --> 00:19:04,965
John, what are you doing?

329
00:19:05,009 --> 00:19:06,492
Proving a point.

330
00:19:06,831 --> 00:19:09,013
Fear doesn't have to own you.

331
00:19:09,032 --> 00:19:11,504
Fear is something you can control.

332
00:19:12,392 --> 00:19:13,731
I don't want to die.

333
00:19:13,781 --> 00:19:15,305
Everyone dies, Astrid.

334
00:19:16,790 --> 00:19:20,688
All you can do is make sure you're
wearing the right shoes when it happens.

335
00:19:22,070 --> 00:19:23,960
Do you trust me?

336
00:19:37,982 --> 00:19:39,565
I know you're scared.

337
00:19:40,441 --> 00:19:41,936
I'm scared too.

338
00:19:42,831 --> 00:19:44,250
But I'm right here.

339
00:19:51,648 --> 00:19:52,926
Count of three.

340
00:19:55,439 --> 00:19:56,428
One.

341
00:20:07,146 --> 00:20:08,360
We're still alive.

342
00:20:08,391 --> 00:20:09,661
Yeah, we are.

343
00:20:15,412 --> 00:20:16,449
Thank you.

344
00:20:20,149 --> 00:20:22,877
Uh, well you are certainly very good at

345
00:20:22,883 --> 00:20:24,716
dealing with life and death issues.

346
00:20:27,407 --> 00:20:30,347
Look, I don't know why
you're avoiding the lair.

347
00:20:30,416 --> 00:20:32,718
But maybe you should

348
00:20:32,838 --> 00:20:34,765
face your fear. And...

349
00:20:35,597 --> 00:20:37,543
take your own leap of faith.

350
00:20:40,323 --> 00:20:42,663
How the hell did Julian
know where we were gonna be?

351
00:20:42,694 --> 00:20:44,384
Our grocery grab.

352
00:20:44,962 --> 00:20:47,561
I was borrowing a page
from Julian's playbook.

353
00:20:47,848 --> 00:20:50,339
And now he's working for Ultra. Wow.

354
00:20:50,459 --> 00:20:52,310
Must have figured he could join forces.

355
00:20:57,741 --> 00:20:59,669
Tim, where is that?

356
00:20:59,688 --> 00:21:01,346
That's Stephen's neighborhood.

357
00:21:01,396 --> 00:21:03,148
Charlotte asked me to locate it for her.

358
00:21:03,268 --> 00:21:05,064
I do hope I haven't overstepped.

359
00:21:05,565 --> 00:21:07,090
Where is she now, Tim?

360
00:21:07,210 --> 00:21:08,754
Looking for John.

361
00:21:20,426 --> 00:21:21,853
John?

362
00:21:23,598 --> 00:21:24,956
Can you hear me?

363
00:21:36,864 --> 00:21:38,223
What's that?

364
00:21:38,432 --> 00:21:39,737
Probably nothing.

365
00:21:39,762 --> 00:21:41,739
It's a paranormal blip.
We get them all the time.

366
00:21:41,859 --> 00:21:44,861
Or one of Cara's rats who
got lost on their way home?

367
00:21:46,243 --> 00:21:47,624
I say we check it out.

368
00:21:48,208 --> 00:21:49,490
Cool with that, Stephen?

369
00:21:50,628 --> 00:21:52,278
Of course.

370
00:22:04,842 --> 00:22:06,225
Get out.

371
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:10,182
What the hell are you doing?

372
00:22:10,302 --> 00:22:12,478
Whatever happened back there at the store,

373
00:22:12,598 --> 00:22:13,841
I don't like it.

374
00:22:14,079 --> 00:22:16,037
And as long as I got a bomb in my brain,

375
00:22:16,157 --> 00:22:17,520
I'm only going to trust me.

376
00:22:17,846 --> 00:22:19,060
Sorry.

377
00:22:25,746 --> 00:22:27,480
John.

378
00:22:28,916 --> 00:22:31,010
John, Julian's on his way to my house,

379
00:22:31,011 --> 00:22:32,638
you got to get out of there.

380
00:22:32,901 --> 00:22:33,836
Julian?

381
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:35,886
Stephen, I'm not at your house.

382
00:22:36,474 --> 00:22:38,176
Then Julian is...

383
00:22:46,166 --> 00:22:47,633
John!

384
00:22:50,119 --> 00:22:51,908
Long time no see, little one.

385
00:22:52,934 --> 00:22:55,084
- Come here!
-  Stop!

386
00:23:11,237 --> 00:23:12,426
What happened?

387
00:23:12,463 --> 00:23:14,396
I found you on the street.

388
00:23:14,446 --> 00:23:16,261
Not far from where I found this.

389
00:23:19,126 --> 00:23:20,459
Charlotte.

390
00:23:20,528 --> 00:23:22,061
Why didn't you tell me Julian was back?

391
00:23:22,181 --> 00:23:24,632
I thought they were going to
strip Julian of his powers.

392
00:23:24,676 --> 00:23:26,491
I gotta get to Ultra.

393
00:23:26,493 --> 00:23:28,493
- Good luck.
- Where are you going?

394
00:23:29,030 --> 00:23:31,163
Where I should have been all along.

395
00:23:50,580 --> 00:23:53,534
- You had my clearance revoked.
- Don't take it personally.

396
00:23:53,558 --> 00:23:56,387
We will reactivate you just as
soon as the operation's over.

397
00:23:56,412 --> 00:23:59,509
He used to be the enemy. He's got
a little girl handcuffed in there.

398
00:23:59,629 --> 00:24:02,244
So, you're just gonna
let him terrorize her?

399
00:24:03,381 --> 00:24:06,547
Charlotte is unfortunately
no stranger to our process.

400
00:24:06,667 --> 00:24:08,412
How can you put more faith

401
00:24:08,424 --> 00:24:11,265
into some deranged psychopath, than in me?

402
00:24:11,571 --> 00:24:15,200
I put a timed explosive device
in Julian's head that I control.

403
00:24:15,381 --> 00:24:16,889
That makes him inclined to do what

404
00:24:16,908 --> 00:24:18,365
I want him to do.

405
00:24:18,397 --> 00:24:20,905
You don't have an explosive
device in your head, Stephen.

406
00:24:21,081 --> 00:24:24,516
And furthermore, you're compromised
by your feelings for Cara.

407
00:24:24,903 --> 00:24:27,637
I'm sorry. You fell in
love with the wrong girl,

408
00:24:27,757 --> 00:24:29,158
a militant paranormal.

409
00:24:29,195 --> 00:24:31,886
And that's why Julian has
the mission and you don't.

410
00:24:57,394 --> 00:24:59,784
I promised myself I wouldn't cry.

411
00:25:04,114 --> 00:25:06,424
Welcome back, buddy.

412
00:25:10,675 --> 00:25:12,681
- Charlotte's missing.
- I know.

413
00:25:12,715 --> 00:25:14,489
She's been taken by Julian.

414
00:25:14,711 --> 00:25:15,781
That's why I'm back.

415
00:25:15,831 --> 00:25:17,324
She came looking for me. It's my fault.

416
00:25:17,339 --> 00:25:18,277
Ultra's got her.

417
00:25:18,302 --> 00:25:19,416
Then it's only a matter of time

418
00:25:19,441 --> 00:25:21,662
before they get inside her head
and get everything they need.

419
00:25:35,678 --> 00:25:37,629
Can we at least talk about this?

420
00:25:37,631 --> 00:25:39,181
Sure, let's talk.

421
00:25:39,183 --> 00:25:40,682
Are you just here to get your gun?

422
00:25:40,707 --> 00:25:43,091
To say your goodbyes before
you go get yourself killed?

423
00:25:43,504 --> 00:25:46,288
And to say that I'm sorry for the
way things are between us right now.

424
00:25:46,313 --> 00:25:49,011
You are just gonna do the
exact same thing, aren't you?

425
00:25:49,461 --> 00:25:51,463
Would it even matter if
I asked you not to go?

426
00:25:51,507 --> 00:25:52,564
No.

427
00:25:52,566 --> 00:25:54,385
So nothing's changed.

428
00:25:54,934 --> 00:25:56,351
Nothing's changed.

429
00:25:58,037 --> 00:25:59,354
I still love you.

430
00:26:04,144 --> 00:26:05,611
So this is goodbye.

431
00:26:06,522 --> 00:26:09,248
What is your plan, you're gonna shoot
your way into Ultra to save Charlotte?

432
00:26:09,250 --> 00:26:10,927
John, it is suicide.

433
00:26:12,752 --> 00:26:13,936
I have to do this.

434
00:26:31,639 --> 00:26:33,810
Two against one? How is that fair?

435
00:26:42,532 --> 00:26:44,763
Should have stayed in hiding, John.

436
00:26:45,535 --> 00:26:46,735
Ahhh!

437
00:26:51,499 --> 00:26:52,494
We gotta get out of here.

438
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:53,420
Why are you doing this?

439
00:26:53,432 --> 00:26:55,147
I told you, we take care of each other.

440
00:27:11,144 --> 00:27:12,728
All right, that's enough.

441
00:27:15,765 --> 00:27:17,599
Just wrapping up, actually.

442
00:27:18,685 --> 00:27:19,985
Don't worry.

443
00:27:20,264 --> 00:27:22,104
I got everything I needed.

444
00:27:24,490 --> 00:27:26,942
You know where the
Tomorrow People are hiding?

445
00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:30,829
Yes.

446
00:27:33,416 --> 00:27:35,649
And I'll gladly share
that location with you

447
00:27:35,661 --> 00:27:37,820
as soon as you take
this bomb out of my head.

448
00:27:39,923 --> 00:27:40,867
No,

449
00:27:41,411 --> 00:27:42,775
I didn't think so.

450
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:45,440
Time's ticking, Julian.

451
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:47,323
You want me to give up
my only bargaining chip

452
00:27:47,348 --> 00:27:49,613
with no guarantee that
you'll actually spare me.

453
00:27:51,866 --> 00:27:52,973
No, thanks.

454
00:27:53,093 --> 00:27:54,643
Think I'll stick to our original deal.

455
00:27:54,662 --> 00:27:55,787
Good.

456
00:27:56,345 --> 00:27:58,960
In that case, a fresh team of
agents will be at your disposal.

457
00:27:59,016 --> 00:28:00,208
No agents.

458
00:28:00,727 --> 00:28:02,445
I want a kill squad.

459
00:28:03,596 --> 00:28:05,631
In case they give me any trouble.

460
00:28:20,137 --> 00:28:22,027
Look, Julian, I know you don't trust me...

461
00:28:22,033 --> 00:28:23,585
Please, come with.

462
00:28:24,417 --> 00:28:26,675
How could I say no to the boss' nephew?

463
00:28:33,477 --> 00:28:34,991
Get out of there, Cara.

464
00:28:35,029 --> 00:28:37,294
Julian's got a kill squad,
and he's coming for you.

465
00:28:38,848 --> 00:28:40,515
John, wait!

466
00:28:40,517 --> 00:28:42,193
You're not gonna talk me out of it, Cara.

467
00:28:42,199 --> 00:28:44,464
You don't understand.
Ultra knows where we are.

468
00:28:44,508 --> 00:28:46,448
They're coming. Now.

469
00:28:56,239 --> 00:28:57,877
What's the location of our kill squad?

470
00:28:57,908 --> 00:29:00,217
Central Manhattan. On the move, looks like.

471
00:29:00,230 --> 00:29:02,338
Sir? It's him. Julian.

472
00:29:05,582 --> 00:29:06,697
Yes.

473
00:29:06,716 --> 00:29:08,617
Hey, Jed. Remind me.

474
00:29:08,824 --> 00:29:12,037
How can you be sure that the little bomb
you stuck up my snout's gonna kill me?

475
00:29:12,039 --> 00:29:16,476
Well, Julian, it has the same
explosive force as a grenade, so...

476
00:29:16,596 --> 00:29:18,660
And, let's say...

477
00:29:19,530 --> 00:29:22,047
If your nephew was
standing right beside me.

478
00:29:22,049 --> 00:29:23,632
Stephen's there?

479
00:29:24,022 --> 00:29:26,288
I want an exact location
on that kill squad now.

480
00:29:27,695 --> 00:29:29,458
I thought you said no paranormals.

481
00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:30,709
I did.

482
00:29:33,744 --> 00:29:36,265
That's why I'm putting a
suppression cuff on him.

483
00:29:36,591 --> 00:29:38,384
So I can keep him close.

484
00:29:38,768 --> 00:29:40,602
Deal stays the same, Julian.

485
00:29:40,604 --> 00:29:42,304
I will uphold my half of the bargain.

486
00:29:42,306 --> 00:29:44,356
And I expect you to uphold yours.

487
00:29:46,693 --> 00:29:48,694
Your nephew's life depends on it.

488
00:29:54,058 --> 00:29:55,884
Must be underground.

489
00:29:58,656 --> 00:30:00,807
Everyone's headed to the
safe house in Far Rockaway.

490
00:30:00,813 --> 00:30:01,658
I want you to go with them.

491
00:30:01,671 --> 00:30:02,872
I'm not going anywhere.

492
00:30:02,992 --> 00:30:04,877
I need you at the safe house.

493
00:30:04,887 --> 00:30:07,162
Somebody has to be there
to keep everybody calm.

494
00:30:07,164 --> 00:30:08,831
They'll be fine. I'm staying.

495
00:30:10,083 --> 00:30:13,252
John, this is exactly why
things fell apart for us before.

496
00:30:13,670 --> 00:30:14,420
Why's that?

497
00:30:14,422 --> 00:30:15,771
Because you are so damn stubborn.

498
00:30:15,773 --> 00:30:16,461
I'm stubborn?

499
00:30:16,492 --> 00:30:17,973
You don't respect my decisions.

500
00:30:17,975 --> 00:30:19,374
That is not true.

501
00:30:19,670 --> 00:30:21,885
I am in charge down here
and I gave you an order,

502
00:30:21,897 --> 00:30:24,396
I want you at the safe house now,
I am not going to repeat myself.

503
00:30:24,398 --> 00:30:25,432
I'm not going anywhere.

504
00:30:25,433 --> 00:30:27,266
Damn it, John. Why are you doing this?

505
00:30:28,217 --> 00:30:29,875
Because after finding you,

506
00:30:29,931 --> 00:30:32,058
and building this place up from nothing,

507
00:30:32,096 --> 00:30:33,097
together,

508
00:30:33,159 --> 00:30:35,911
and turning it into a shelter,
and then a home for us,

509
00:30:36,238 --> 00:30:37,133
can't you see?

510
00:30:37,158 --> 00:30:38,872
This is where I belong.

511
00:30:39,254 --> 00:30:41,910
By your side. No matter what happens to us.

512
00:30:57,388 --> 00:30:58,627
Take this off my wrist,

513
00:30:58,633 --> 00:31:00,541
I will help you level the playing field.

514
00:31:00,567 --> 00:31:02,548
Shh. We're getting close.

515
00:31:13,059 --> 00:31:14,643
This is where we get off.

516
00:31:26,658 --> 00:31:28,935
And then, there were three.

517
00:31:29,055 --> 00:31:31,663
Everyone else has
teleported to the safe house.

518
00:31:32,476 --> 00:31:34,103
We're taking inventory of our arsenal.

519
00:31:34,122 --> 00:31:35,237
Julian will be here soon.

520
00:31:35,805 --> 00:31:36,805
What is all this stuff?

521
00:31:36,807 --> 00:31:39,802
Most of it is Roger's.
Pieces of experiments.

522
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:41,654
I haven't been able to throw any of it out.

523
00:31:41,710 --> 00:31:43,181
Got about a dozen D chips here.

524
00:31:43,218 --> 00:31:45,139
Which will only suppress our powers,

525
00:31:45,183 --> 00:31:47,130
not the human kill squad.

526
00:31:47,250 --> 00:31:48,650
Here we go.

527
00:31:49,703 --> 00:31:52,021
That's what I'm talking about.

528
00:31:52,565 --> 00:31:53,860
Lock and load, Johnny.

529
00:31:53,879 --> 00:31:54,990
Put the guns away.

530
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:58,294
I've got another plan.

531
00:32:02,599 --> 00:32:04,658
Try again for another positioning signal.

532
00:32:04,677 --> 00:32:07,219
Sir, there's been no contact in
seven minutes. They're too deep.

533
00:32:09,082 --> 00:32:10,389
How much time do we have left?

534
00:32:10,458 --> 00:32:13,111
Six minutes, 12 seconds. Would
you like me to disable the bomb?

535
00:32:13,231 --> 00:32:14,862
If I wanted you to disable the bomb,

536
00:32:14,862 --> 00:32:16,678
I would have told you to disable the bomb.

537
00:32:17,866 --> 00:32:19,515
Signal, give me a signal.

538
00:32:36,967 --> 00:32:38,867
So this is their hideout.

539
00:32:39,481 --> 00:32:41,533
Where is everybody?
We're running out of time.

540
00:32:43,485 --> 00:32:46,795
This isn't about the Tomorrow People,
Julian, this is about you and me.

541
00:32:47,644 --> 00:32:50,062
You can take me in to Ultra,
it's time for this to be over.

542
00:32:54,217 --> 00:32:56,268
I'm not here to arrest you, Cara.

543
00:32:58,388 --> 00:33:00,272
No one has to die here.

544
00:33:01,191 --> 00:33:03,531
Can you bring Nelly back from the grave?

545
00:33:04,845 --> 00:33:06,159
Then I beg to differ.

546
00:33:06,459 --> 00:33:07,746
I didn't kill her.

547
00:33:08,286 --> 00:33:09,882
You are so bent on revenge,

548
00:33:09,894 --> 00:33:11,252
you would turn against your own kind,

549
00:33:11,258 --> 00:33:12,471
some day that'll catch up with you.

550
00:33:12,496 --> 00:33:14,742
Blah, blah, blah, blah. Would
somebody shoot her already?

551
00:33:14,862 --> 00:33:15,802
No!

552
00:33:22,179 --> 00:33:23,512
I knew you were a rat.

553
00:33:23,921 --> 00:33:25,767
But thanks for the confirmation.

554
00:33:29,938 --> 00:33:31,134
Wait.

555
00:33:31,254 --> 00:33:32,721
She's still here.

556
00:33:34,107 --> 00:33:35,641
I can feel her.

557
00:33:36,759 --> 00:33:38,227
Poor thing.

558
00:33:38,979 --> 00:33:40,596
All of her friends have left her.

559
00:33:40,598 --> 00:33:42,615
That's not quite true.

560
00:33:45,787 --> 00:33:47,169
Hold your fire!

561
00:33:47,289 --> 00:33:49,009
He's just trying to disorient you.

562
00:33:49,129 --> 00:33:50,385
Oh hey, Julian.

563
00:33:50,954 --> 00:33:52,074
Remember me?

564
00:33:52,550 --> 00:33:54,283
What are you waiting for? Shoot!

565
00:33:57,447 --> 00:33:59,662
I thought you said hold your fire.

566
00:33:59,782 --> 00:34:01,525
This is getting confusing.

567
00:34:05,455 --> 00:34:07,256
Make up your mind, Julian!

568
00:34:07,775 --> 00:34:09,014
Time's running out.

569
00:34:11,254 --> 00:34:12,455
This way.

570
00:34:27,143 --> 00:34:28,977
Enough with the games, Cara.

571
00:34:29,829 --> 00:34:31,647
You know you can't kill me anyway.

572
00:34:32,458 --> 00:34:33,832
I don't have to.

573
00:34:34,084 --> 00:34:35,284
Now!

574
00:34:41,337 --> 00:34:43,483
The glass is bulletproof, Julian.

575
00:35:03,647 --> 00:35:04,863
Stephen?

576
00:35:05,283 --> 00:35:06,451
You let me out of here,

577
00:35:06,464 --> 00:35:08,265
I won't say anything
about this to your uncle.

578
00:35:13,389 --> 00:35:14,502
Hey, Julian,

579
00:35:14,502 --> 00:35:16,623
remember what happened when
you caught me in your house?

580
00:35:18,044 --> 00:35:20,012
Now, you're in my house.

581
00:35:25,289 --> 00:35:27,247
Mission should have been over by now.

582
00:35:35,826 --> 00:35:37,847
Stop the countdown.

583
00:35:40,631 --> 00:35:43,540
- I said stop the bomb.
- We've just lost contact with the device.

584
00:35:43,559 --> 00:35:45,286
It's too far underground.

585
00:36:13,383 --> 00:36:14,683
Cara.

586
00:36:16,191 --> 00:36:18,475
Don't do this, all right? I'm begging you.

587
00:36:19,689 --> 00:36:21,655
I made a mistake.

588
00:36:21,775 --> 00:36:23,429
I'm one of you.

589
00:36:26,677 --> 00:36:28,485
You can't do this to me!

590
00:36:29,699 --> 00:36:31,433
You did this to yourself.

591
00:36:34,904 --> 00:36:36,488
Cara!

592
00:37:00,103 --> 00:37:02,180
Everything all right, sir?

593
00:37:06,802 --> 00:37:08,136
Okay.

594
00:37:09,271 --> 00:37:10,805
What happened?

595
00:37:10,807 --> 00:37:11,990
Where's Julian?

596
00:37:11,992 --> 00:37:14,492
I was just about to ask you the same thing.

597
00:37:14,811 --> 00:37:16,945
The minute I got on the
train, he knocked me out.

598
00:37:17,065 --> 00:37:19,364
I woke up a half an hour
ago, riding the G Line.

599
00:37:19,366 --> 00:37:20,732
Lucky for you.

600
00:37:21,186 --> 00:37:23,464
- So you let the bomb go off?
- I did.

601
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:26,221
No word from the kill squad either.

602
00:37:29,225 --> 00:37:31,271
I'm glad Julian's no longer with us,

603
00:37:31,284 --> 00:37:33,661
he was too dangerous
to be out on the street.

604
00:37:34,997 --> 00:37:36,681
Happy you're back, though.

605
00:37:40,169 --> 00:37:42,687
I want this war to end, Stephen.

606
00:37:44,857 --> 00:37:46,441
I would...

607
00:37:47,326 --> 00:37:49,527
I would do anything to see it finished.

608
00:37:50,196 --> 00:37:51,863
What about the little girl?

609
00:37:52,865 --> 00:37:54,065
Charlotte?

610
00:37:54,067 --> 00:37:56,201
I'm sending her back to the Citadel.

611
00:37:57,403 --> 00:37:58,686
Where else?

612
00:38:00,372 --> 00:38:03,511
You know, you say this
war is to protect humanity,

613
00:38:06,695 --> 00:38:09,247
you don't know the first
thing about being human.

614
00:38:23,512 --> 00:38:25,096
I just want to go home!

615
00:38:28,198 --> 00:38:29,287
Please,

616
00:38:29,481 --> 00:38:31,714
I just want to go home.

617
00:38:33,439 --> 00:38:35,073
You got it, Charlotte.

618
00:38:36,192 --> 00:38:37,408
Russell.

619
00:38:37,595 --> 00:38:39,444
Buckle your seatbelt, sweetie.

620
00:38:39,446 --> 00:38:41,279
I like to drive pretty fast.

621
00:38:51,573 --> 00:38:54,720
Oh, I hope you're not going
to school looking like that.

622
00:38:54,921 --> 00:38:56,535
Please, let yourself in.

623
00:38:56,948 --> 00:38:58,594
I thought you were sick.

624
00:38:59,264 --> 00:39:01,232
Yeah, well I'm feeling better now.

625
00:39:01,234 --> 00:39:02,600
It was John, actually.

626
00:39:02,602 --> 00:39:04,152
Helped me to see it was all up here.

627
00:39:04,154 --> 00:39:05,570
Good.

628
00:39:05,901 --> 00:39:08,289
'Cause I don't want my other
life to come between us.

629
00:39:09,325 --> 00:39:11,442
I don't know what I would
do without you, Astrid.

630
00:39:14,573 --> 00:39:16,788
Me either.

631
00:39:18,007 --> 00:39:20,491
All right. Oh, um...

632
00:39:20,810 --> 00:39:22,287
So, you and John, huh?

633
00:39:22,755 --> 00:39:24,677
Mmm. Yeah.

634
00:39:25,891 --> 00:39:27,123
No.

635
00:39:27,467 --> 00:39:29,056
Go get ready.

636
00:39:36,519 --> 00:39:39,317
You know what the scariest
part of this whole thing was?

637
00:39:40,068 --> 00:39:41,883
Having to look you in the eye

638
00:39:41,924 --> 00:39:43,742
and see what we've lost.

639
00:39:46,629 --> 00:39:48,146
It's terrifying.

640
00:39:49,915 --> 00:39:52,734
I guess that's why I couldn't
bring myself to come back.

641
00:39:53,552 --> 00:39:55,320
There's nothing to be afraid of.

642
00:39:55,955 --> 00:39:57,488
I'm still here.

643
00:39:58,824 --> 00:40:00,491
We're all still here.

644
00:40:00,493 --> 00:40:02,184
I feel like everything we've worked

645
00:40:02,184 --> 00:40:04,130
so hard to build here is

646
00:40:04,524 --> 00:40:05,994
somehow broken.

647
00:40:11,353 --> 00:40:13,504
Then we will build it again.

648
00:40:16,892 --> 00:40:18,176
Together.

649
00:40:28,654 --> 00:40:29,988
You're back.

650
00:40:29,990 --> 00:40:31,856
Yeah, Charlie, I am.

651
00:40:32,208 --> 00:40:33,541
So are you.

652
00:40:34,359 --> 00:40:35,543
So are you.

653
00:40:48,897 --> 00:40:50,391
Hello, Stephen.

654
00:40:50,605 --> 00:40:51,418
Hey, Tim,

655
00:40:51,474 --> 00:40:54,202
do you know where I can find John or Cara?

656
00:40:54,596 --> 00:40:56,510
Oh, dear, I'm afraid,

657
00:40:56,630 --> 00:40:57,843
yes, I do.

658
00:40:58,767 --> 00:41:00,185
Okay, would you like to tell me?

659
00:41:00,439 --> 00:41:02,353
I was told to keep it a secret.

660
00:41:02,817 --> 00:41:06,339
Let's just say Cara and John
are together, and, well...

661
00:41:06,377 --> 00:41:07,358
indisposed.

662
00:41:10,279 --> 00:41:11,629
Okay.

663
00:41:11,749 --> 00:41:13,281
That's good.

664
00:41:13,596 --> 00:41:15,066
Do me a favor though, Tim?

665
00:41:15,123 --> 00:41:16,417
Anything, Stephen.

666
00:41:16,419 --> 00:41:18,670
Remind me not to tell you any secrets.

667
00:41:19,205 --> 00:41:20,705
What is all this stuff?

668
00:41:20,707 --> 00:41:22,149
According to John,

669
00:41:22,218 --> 00:41:24,576
remnants of your father's
various experiments.

670
00:41:40,025 --> 00:41:41,476
What is this?

671
00:41:41,478 --> 00:41:43,427
Your father never told me.

672
00:41:44,097 --> 00:41:46,418
But it does rather seem
to like you, doesn't it?
