could come back to haunt him.

542
00:56:08,994 --> 00:56:10,624
And what are you suggesting?

543
00:56:10,746 --> 00:56:13,036
I watched Bourne with those files.

544
00:56:14,583 --> 00:56:16,253
Desperately looking into his past.

545
00:56:16,418 --> 00:56:19,588
And I think he's at a tipping point.

546
00:56:19,630 --> 00:56:22,300
If I could get face-to-face with him,

547
00:56:22,382 --> 00:56:24,012
I think I can bring him back in.

548
00:56:24,801 --> 00:56:25,931
One attempt.

549
00:56:25,969 --> 00:56:27,889
And if it fails,

550
00:56:28,472 --> 00:56:30,522
you do what you have to.

551
00:56:34,102 --> 00:56:36,772

it'll end there?
