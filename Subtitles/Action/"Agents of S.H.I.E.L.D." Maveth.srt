bleed out right in front of you.</i>

5
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:10,811
<i>No! No!
Ward, what did you do?</i>

6
00:00:10,836 --> 00:00:12,615
Agent Mackenzie, to take Ward
out, I need to cross some lines

7
00:00:12,651 --> 00:00:14,718
the director of
S.H.I.E.L.D. shouldn't cross.

8
00:00:14,743 --> 00:00:17,553
- What, you want me to fill in?
- As acting director until it's finished.

<i>Hunter: Trace puts Ward in

10
00:00:19,524 --> 00:00:21,392
They're at the castle where
we brought Simmons back.

11
00:00:21,417 --> 00:00:23,059
Which would explain why
he kidnapped her and Fitz.

12
00:00:23,094 --> 00:00:24,743
'Cause Malick's trying
to open another portal.

13
00:00:25,323 --> 00:00:27,363
It wants to come back.
And finally, after all these years,

14
00:00:27,399 --> 00:00:29,137
we found someone to help us do that.

15
00:00:29,162 --> 00:00:30,400
<i>Simmons: Fitz, you can't do this.</i>

16
00:00:30,435 --> 00:00:32,420
We can't let them bring that
thing back to this planet!

17
00:00:32,445 --> 00:00:34,775
I lost you once.
I can't lose you again.

18
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:37,240
Only thing I'm gonna
bring back is Will. Okay?

19
00:00:37,275 --> 00:00:39,609
Find it, get to the exit coordinates,

20
00:00:39,644 --> 00:00:42,578
we'll turn the portal back
on in exactly 12 hours.

21
00:00:42,614 --> 00:00:45,014
Be the one that finishes
what Hydra started.

<i>Coulson: Looks like
they're getting ready.</i>

23
00:00:46,864 --> 00:00:49,352
- That's Ward.
- Bobbi: He's going through.

24
00:00:49,554 --> 00:00:51,218
Coulson, wait!

25
00:00:52,757 --> 00:00:54,557
Shut it down.

Fitz.

29
00:01:34,466 --> 00:01:37,266
- Go ahead and scout that ridge.
- Yes sir.

30
00:01:42,503 --> 00:01:44,933
We have less than six hours
to find the next portal and go home.

31
00:01:44,958 --> 00:01:47,414
Why don't you shut the hell
up so I can concentrate?

32
00:01:47,849 --> 00:01:50,335
This program's a work in
progress, designed from

33
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:53,249
Simmons' limited data and
hypothetical calculations.

34
00:01:54,679 --> 00:01:57,746
See?
Our exit location is determined

35
00:01:57,771 --> 00:01:59,969
- by the position of the ...
- Just figure it out.

Aah!

39
00:02:11,236 --> 00:02:12,635
Let me be clear...

40
00:02:13,804 --> 00:02:15,938
[Gun cocks]

41
00:02:16,147 --> 00:02:17,757
...if I don't make it back,

42
00:02:17,782 --> 00:02:22,178
Simmons will be killed...
slowly, horribly.

43
00:02:22,548 --> 00:02:24,580
It'd all be your fault.
Is that what you want?

44
00:02:24,616 --> 00:02:27,116
What do you want?
Why are we here?

45
00:02:27,152 --> 00:02:31,508
Find some ancient, mythical creature.

46
00:02:31,533 --> 00:02:34,056
Wake up, Ward.
This is a snark hunt,

47
00:02:34,081 --> 00:02:38,226
and the only reason Malick sent you
is because you're expendable.

48
00:02:38,575 --> 00:02:40,950
<i>Man: Sir, over here!</i>

49
00:02:40,975 --> 00:02:43,065
Move.
Move!

50
00:02:54,511 --> 00:02:56,445
Is that...

51
00:03:03,887 --> 00:03:06,455
Hail Hydra.

[Music]

54
00:03:34,284 --> 00:03:36,217
One of you want to tell me
what Coulson was thinking

55
00:03:36,252 --> 00:03:37,652
jumping out of the Quinjet like that?

56
00:03:37,687 --> 00:03:39,720
I would say he wasn't so
much thinking as feeling ...

57
00:03:39,756 --> 00:03:42,657
- feeling that Ward needs to die.
- And you didn't try to stop him.

58
00:03:42,692 --> 00:03:46,294
Full disclosure ...
I was planning on jumping, as well.

59
00:03:46,329 --> 00:03:49,130
Again, less thinking than feeling.

60
00:03:49,165 --> 00:03:50,364
Coulson went there to get our people.

61
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,166
"Our people" ...
what are you talking about?

62
00:03:52,202 --> 00:03:53,868
We believe that Ward
took Fitz or Simmons

63
00:03:53,903 --> 00:03:55,203
through the portal with him.

64
00:03:55,238 --> 00:03:57,238
Hopefully, Coulson can find
them and bring them back safely.

65
00:03:57,273 --> 00:03:59,040
All we have to do is
take control of the castle

66
00:03:59,075 --> 00:04:00,575
and open the portal so they can return.

67
00:04:00,610 --> 00:04:03,295
[Clicks tongue]
So, just take the ultra-fortified

68
00:04:03,296 --> 00:04:07,704
Hydra castle and open the
alien portal. That's it?

69
00:04:08,818 --> 00:04:11,285
You know, you're wired
different than most folks.

70
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:12,753
I'm not saying it'll be easy.

71
00:04:12,788 --> 00:04:14,288
I wouldn't mind hearing
it's gonna be easy.

72
00:04:14,323 --> 00:04:17,124
- It'll be easy.
- Doesn't work if I know you're lying.

73
00:04:17,159 --> 00:04:19,426
<i>Daisy: Mack ... or, director,
you guys should get up here.</i>

74
00:04:21,497 --> 00:04:24,098
<i>This is Hydra's compound
outside the castle.</i>

75
00:04:24,133 --> 00:04:25,966
And these two trucks were just unloaded.

76
00:04:26,002 --> 00:04:28,334
Lincoln: What are they
bringing in now? More weapons?

77
00:04:30,139 --> 00:04:32,840
Inhumans.
They're stockpiling Inhumans.

78
00:04:32,875 --> 00:04:34,141
That's how I read it.

79
00:04:34,176 --> 00:04:36,377
Looks like 10 or 12 of
those gel-matrix containers.

Andrew ... he's probably
down there, as well.

81
00:04:39,582 --> 00:04:43,150
Okay. So, are we rescuing
Inhumans or saving Coulson

82
00:04:43,185 --> 00:04:45,586
or attacking Hydra
or is there some kind of combo?

83
00:04:48,221 --> 00:04:50,424
Sorry.
New guy just trying to understand

84
00:04:50,459 --> 00:04:52,086
how this whole S.H.I.E.L.D. thing works.

85
00:04:52,111 --> 00:04:53,627
This is how S.H.I.E.L.D. works.

00:04:53,652 --> 00:04:55,227
You make a plan, plan turns to rubbish,

87
00:04:55,252 --> 00:04:57,742
we make a new plan.
Oh, just to be crystal clear,

88
00:04:57,767 --> 00:04:59,896
this is the part where
the plan turns to rubbish.

89
00:05:00,403 --> 00:05:03,399
Whatever the new plan, we need to
make sure those Inhumans are safe.

90
00:05:03,424 --> 00:05:04,371
And find Fitz and Simmons.

91
00:05:04,407 --> 00:05:05,940
And we get Coulson
back through the portal.

92
00:05:05,975 --> 00:05:08,251
Would everyone just shut up a second?

93
00:05:10,567 --> 00:05:13,613
Even cloaked, Hydra's missiles
will find us if we get too close.

94
00:05:13,648 --> 00:05:15,882
And I will not be the one
who has to tell Coulson

95
00:05:15,917 --> 00:05:17,714
we got his fancy new plane blown up.

96
00:05:17,739 --> 00:05:22,422
Now, the only way to take the castle
and secure the portal is on the Q.T.

97
00:05:22,457 --> 00:05:26,025
That means no gunfire and no backup.

98
00:05:26,848 --> 00:05:29,429
We leave all tactical support up here.
Is that clear?

99
00:05:30,598 --> 00:05:31,965
Two infiltration teams ...

100
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,334
one to search the compound
for Fitz or Simmons

101
00:05:34,369 --> 00:05:36,035
and one to secure the portal.

102
00:05:36,071 --> 00:05:38,938
We'll take care of everyone,
including the Inhumans,

103
00:05:38,974 --> 00:05:41,322
but first things first. Go.

104
00:05:42,878 --> 00:05:44,878

105
00:05:44,913 --> 00:05:47,247

[Computer beeps]

107
00:05:54,350 --> 00:05:55,589
The cargo's here.

108
00:05:55,755 --> 00:05:58,124
All Inhuman systems
are stable and online.

109
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:02,729
- The team is ready to revive them.
- Patience, Mr. Giyera.

110
00:06:02,764 --> 00:06:04,597
They're not our toys to play with.

111
00:06:04,633 --> 00:06:08,334
They're presents for our friend
once grant Ward brings it back.

112
00:06:08,670 --> 00:06:11,771
Every general needs an army.

113
00:06:11,806 --> 00:06:14,740
So, how long do we have
once the portal reopens?

114
00:06:14,776 --> 00:06:16,509
- 73 seconds.
- Simmons: He's wrong.

115
00:06:16,544 --> 00:06:19,946
Your team's calculations are off at 61.

116
00:06:19,981 --> 00:06:22,548
12 seconds might not seem like much,
but on that planet,

117
00:06:22,584 --> 00:06:24,016
it can be the difference
between life and death.

118
00:06:24,052 --> 00:06:26,853
- Thank you.
- I'm not doing it for you.

119
00:06:26,888 --> 00:06:29,422
Don't want you all
mucking up Fitz's return.

120
00:06:31,426 --> 00:06:36,629
Did you notice the Hebrew word
"Maveth" carved around the castle?

121
00:06:36,664 --> 00:06:38,464
- Death.
- That's right.

122
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:41,434
Well, death is the only thing
returning through that portal.

123
00:06:41,469 --> 00:06:45,404
Fitz was just... an offering
to show him the door.

124
00:06:51,911 --> 00:06:53,746
The original machinery
used to open the portal

125
00:06:53,781 --> 00:06:55,081
was hydroelectric,

126
00:06:55,116 --> 00:06:57,283
but the nearest river is
almost a half a mile away,

127
00:06:57,318 --> 00:06:59,752
which got me wondering
how they powered it.

128
00:06:59,787 --> 00:07:02,155
- May: Aqueducts.
- Yep.

129
00:07:02,190 --> 00:07:04,056
So they brought the water along there

130
00:07:04,092 --> 00:07:05,391
and then up through the portal chamber.

131
00:07:05,426 --> 00:07:09,195
<i>Now, that looks like an
overflow drain deep in the woods,</i>

132
00:07:09,230 --> 00:07:10,563
<i>so we should be able to
slip into the compound</i>

133
00:07:10,598 --> 00:07:15,101
- without anyone seeing a thing.
- I'll exit here with Bobbi and Hunter.

134
00:07:15,136 --> 00:07:17,203
Hopefully, we can barricade
ourselves long enough

135
00:07:17,238 --> 00:07:19,572
to open the portal and get Coulson back.

136
00:07:19,607 --> 00:07:21,974
May, you and Daisy
take Lincoln and Joey,

137
00:07:22,010 --> 00:07:24,210
And you come out here,
on the Southeast side.

138
00:07:24,245 --> 00:07:28,748
Let's find our people
and get out.

139
00:07:28,783 --> 00:07:30,750

140
00:07:33,631 --> 00:07:36,699

141
00:07:36,724 --> 00:07:39,992
<i>Why don't we go to an alien world
and summon a hell beast?</i>

142
00:07:40,017 --> 00:07:44,820
Yeah, that's a brilliant idea.
What could possibly go wrong with that?

143
00:07:44,912 --> 00:07:48,247
- How are you supposed to find it?
- Not your concern.

144
00:07:48,272 --> 00:07:50,301
You just whisper its name
three times into a mirror?

145
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:53,072
Or do you put a saucer of
milk outside the door at night?

146
00:07:53,107 --> 00:07:56,683
- Not milk.
- Ah, yes, you're right.

147
00:07:56,708 --> 00:07:58,211
Simmons said it can smell blood.

148
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:00,353
That's not disturbing at all.

149
00:08:01,145 --> 00:08:03,346
Who wouldn't want to be on that team?

150
00:08:04,963 --> 00:08:06,129
Uh...

151
00:08:07,388 --> 00:08:10,623
I think that's the
ridge we're looking for.

152
00:08:10,658 --> 00:08:12,658
[Sighs]

153
00:08:16,481 --> 00:08:18,814
You know, uh, Simmons also
said it can drive people crazy.

154
00:08:18,839 --> 00:08:21,473
You're doing a pretty
good job of that yourself.

155

[Thud]

156
00:08:25,895 --> 00:08:28,374
- What's that?
- That's an interesting question.

157
00:08:28,409 --> 00:08:31,777
- I thought I might check.
- Get away from there!

Hey. Hey, Will.

Who the hell is this?

166
00:08:59,177 --> 00:09:02,608
This is Will, okay?
He's gonna be our guide.

167
00:09:10,718 --> 00:09:12,718
Good morning.

[Chuckles lightly]

169
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:27,110

00:22:26,248 --> 00:22:28,381
No, Lincoln, don't! There's
no way they didn't hear that.

342
00:22:28,416 --> 00:22:33,653
- Come on. We've got to go.
- Did you see that?!

343
00:22:34,128 --> 00:22:35,595
I'm bulletproof! Ha!

344
00:22:36,365 --> 00:22:38,932
Investigating gunfire now.

345
00:22:39,294 --> 00:22:41,594
Stop!

346
00:22:43,631 --> 00:22:45,698
Unh!

347
00:22:45,733 --> 00:22:46,933
[Body thuds]

348
00:22:46,968 --> 00:22:48,534
Agent May!

349
00:22:48,570 --> 00:22:50,536
- Fitz....
- Ward took him through the portal.

350
00:22:50,572 --> 00:22:52,004
Come on. We're gonna get him back.

351
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:54,373
- Andrew's here.
- You saw him?

352
00:22:54,409 --> 00:22:57,043
- He saved my life.
- Andrew or Lash?

353
00:22:57,078 --> 00:22:58,377
Technically, I think it was both.

354
00:22:58,413 --> 00:23:01,647
- We could find him, maybe ...
- No. That's not the mission.

355
00:23:01,683 --> 00:23:05,117
Daisy, I've got Simmons.
Heading your way now.

356
00:23:05,153 --> 00:23:07,520
[Wind whistling]

357
00:23:08,890 --> 00:23:11,023
We got to go!

358
00:23:17,365 --> 00:23:18,731
Fan out! Find them!

359
00:23:18,766 --> 00:23:20,833
[Gunshots]

360
00:23:22,670 --> 00:23:23,836
Aah!

361
00:23:23,872 --> 00:23:25,371
No.

362
00:23:30,111 --> 00:23:31,777
You'll never find Fitz without me.

363
00:23:31,813 --> 00:23:34,814
- I'm not here for Fitz.
- Maybe.

364
00:23:34,849 --> 00:23:36,716
But you're not gonna
let him die here, either.

365
00:23:36,751 --> 00:23:39,719
Fitz is a smart guy.
He'll find his way back.

366
00:23:39,754 --> 00:23:41,454
He'll be dead within the hour.

367
00:23:41,489 --> 00:23:45,357
The creature who lives
here can smell blood.

368
00:23:45,393 --> 00:23:46,792
Fitz is bleeding.

369
00:23:50,098 --> 00:23:53,432
So are you.
Now get up.

370
00:23:53,468 --> 00:23:55,000
You're gonna lead the way.

371
00:23:57,576 --> 00:24:01,497
[Music]

372
00:24:01,498 --> 00:24:03,898
The party's this way.

373
00:24:08,577 --> 00:24:10,205
Watch your step.

374
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,607
Left a few breadcrumbs
to find our way home.

375
00:24:20,283 --> 00:24:21,916
Simmons.

376
00:24:21,951 --> 00:24:25,052
Hydra knows we grabbed her.
How secure are we in here?

377
00:24:25,087 --> 00:24:26,553
Rough estimate? Not very.

378
00:24:26,589 --> 00:24:28,573
We've sealed and barricaded
the doors, but Hydra

379
00:24:28,574 --> 00:24:30,557
has plenty of big-boy
toys to smash their way in.

380
00:24:30,593 --> 00:24:32,226
I might be able to reinforce the doors.

381
00:24:32,261 --> 00:24:34,428
You know, using my, uh ...

382
00:24:34,463 --> 00:24:36,697
- my, uh ...
- Amazing new superpower.

383
00:24:36,732 --> 00:24:39,400
- Yeah. That.
- Let's give that a go, then.

384
00:24:39,435 --> 00:24:40,968
Mack's through there.

385
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:46,407
[Footsteps approaching]

386
00:24:47,907 --> 00:24:50,741
There she is.
That's what I'm talking about.

387
00:24:52,444 --> 00:24:55,179
Now, do you have any idea
how the hell these rocks work?

388
00:24:55,214 --> 00:24:56,914
Is that counting down to a
good thing or a bad thing?

389
00:24:56,949 --> 00:24:59,183
It's the time remaining
until the portal reopens.

390
00:24:59,218 --> 00:25:00,484
And answering your question,

391
00:25:00,519 --> 00:25:02,586
I don't believe we have to
do anything to these rocks.

392
00:25:02,621 --> 00:25:05,122
They're configured so they'll
activate at the designated time.

393
00:25:05,157 --> 00:25:06,557
So that's a good thing.

394
00:25:06,592 --> 00:25:09,526
That depends on whether Fitz
can locate the extraction point

395
00:25:09,562 --> 00:25:12,429
- and who or what is with him.
- He'll make it. Coulson's there.

396
00:25:12,464 --> 00:25:14,164
I know, but it's more
complicated than that.

397
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:16,016
- Ward's mission is to ...
- Where's May?

398
00:25:16,902 --> 00:25:18,402
Oh, no.

399
00:25:19,972 --> 00:25:22,940
Dr. Garner is here on the premises.
I spoke with him.

400
00:25:22,975 --> 00:25:26,143
- He's actually the one who saved me.
- He's free?

401
00:25:27,913 --> 00:25:30,514
- May must have gone back for him.
- To do what?

402
00:25:30,549 --> 00:25:34,251
I'd say that depends on
what she finds. [Sighs]

403
00:25:36,241 --> 00:25:39,287
[Beeping]

404
00:25:54,006 --> 00:25:55,706
Oh, god.

405
00:25:58,109 --> 00:26:00,009
<i>Ward: Saw something terrible today.</i>

406
00:26:00,044 --> 00:26:04,147
<i>When I say "terrible,"
I mean ancient and powerful.</i>

407
00:26:04,182 --> 00:26:08,217
It's changed how I see things.

408
00:26:08,253 --> 00:26:12,688
I've never believed
I was worth anything...

409
00:26:12,724 --> 00:26:15,291
that what I said or did had any meaning.

410
00:26:15,326 --> 00:26:17,293
Maybe that's why I'm a spy.

411
00:26:17,328 --> 00:26:20,897
Or why I agreed to come here.

412
00:26:20,932 --> 00:26:23,566
If you're trying to talk me out of this,
you can save your breath.

413
00:26:23,601 --> 00:26:27,270
I'm not looking for mercy or absolution.

414
00:26:27,305 --> 00:26:30,072
I just want you to know,
I've been where you are right now.

415
00:26:30,108 --> 00:26:34,277
Filled with rage, wanting revenge...

416
00:26:34,312 --> 00:26:41,584
I chose Hydra for petty,
personal, selfish reasons ...

417
00:26:41,619 --> 00:26:45,688
for a father figure, for vengeance...

418
00:26:45,723 --> 00:26:47,657
for closure.

419
00:26:50,060 --> 00:26:54,029
But what I saw today
gave my life meaning.

420
00:26:54,064 --> 00:26:58,133
<i>For the first time ever,
I have a sense of satisfaction</i>

421
00:26:58,169 --> 00:27:03,138
that I never experienced
when I was seeking revenge.

422
00:27:03,174 --> 00:27:05,791
[Gunshot]
[Inhales sharply]

423
00:27:06,447 --> 00:27:10,445
Got to say,
feels pretty satisfying to me.

424
00:27:10,481 --> 00:27:12,306
Now turn around and keep walking.

425
00:27:12,931 --> 00:27:15,384
You know, everyone had this place wrong.

426
00:27:15,419 --> 00:27:19,388
It isn't death.
It's a new beginning.

427
00:27:19,423 --> 00:27:24,493
Malick was right.
This is all meant to be.

428
00:27:25,763 --> 00:27:30,165
And the fact that you followed me here,
that we're in this together,

429
00:27:30,201 --> 00:27:35,737
that just confirms the fact
that I am part of a grand plan.

430
00:27:36,324 --> 00:27:38,090
I see that now.

431
00:27:38,115 --> 00:27:40,682
I honestly have no idea
what you're talking about.

432
00:27:40,707 --> 00:27:43,775
You will.

433
00:27:49,285 --> 00:27:52,019
Malick sent Ward to bring
back some ancient Hydra god?

434
00:27:52,055 --> 00:27:55,323
Well, he didn't use those exact words,
but that's the general idea, yes.

435
00:27:55,358 --> 00:27:57,325
It's why he had the
ATCU collect Inhumans,

436
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:59,227
why he shipped them
here to the castle ...

437
00:27:59,262 --> 00:28:01,629
as some kind of army
for this powerful alien.

438
00:28:01,664 --> 00:28:04,232
Look, we all want Fitz and Coulson back.

439
00:28:04,267 --> 00:28:07,235
What if that thing comes back, too?

440
00:28:07,270 --> 00:28:09,370
Your mother was terrified
of the Monolith for a reason.

441
00:28:09,405 --> 00:28:11,205
You think the Hydra thing
is what she was afraid of?

442
00:28:11,241 --> 00:28:14,242
Bobbi: When S.H.I.E.L.D. fell,
Fury sent us onto the Iliad

443
00:28:14,277 --> 00:28:16,077
to keep Hydra from getting
their hands on that Monolith.

444
00:28:16,112 --> 00:28:18,930
What if he knew that
they wanted to bring

445
00:28:18,931 --> 00:28:21,749
- this creature back through it?
- Oh, come on.

446
00:28:21,785 --> 00:28:23,885
[Scoffs]
What, an ancient alien god?

447
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:26,287
Are you people hearing the
words coming out of your mouths?

448
00:28:26,722 --> 00:28:30,691
- The world's changing. Deal with it.
- You were there.

449
00:28:30,726 --> 00:28:35,529
- Did you see it? What's it like?
- I did see it.

450
00:28:35,565 --> 00:28:37,164
But I can't really describe
what it looked like.

451
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:40,167
It's more how it felt,
which is old and pained,

452
00:28:40,203 --> 00:28:42,269
as if it once had
great power but lost it.

453
00:28:42,305 --> 00:28:44,405
And the entire planet is a wasteland.

454
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:45,839
<i>How that came to be,</i>

455
00:28:45,875 --> 00:28:48,142
<i>I can't really say, not
in any scientific terms,</i>

456
00:28:48,177 --> 00:28:52,880
but my sense and certainly
Will's heartfelt belief

457
00:28:52,915 --> 00:28:56,517
was that the creature is
the one responsible ...

458
00:28:56,552 --> 00:28:58,886
that it caused the desolation.

459
00:29:03,058 --> 00:29:05,492
- We have to destroy all this.
- You mean once Fitz and Coulson

460
00:29:05,527 --> 00:29:06,927
find Will and come back through.

461
00:29:06,962 --> 00:29:10,230
I mean, what if they're not
the ones who come back through?

462
00:29:10,265 --> 00:29:11,832
We can't risk that!

463
00:29:11,867 --> 00:29:14,000
Whatever we decide to do
isn't the end of the mission.

464
00:29:14,036 --> 00:29:16,203
There are a dozen
Inhumans in this compound

465
00:29:16,238 --> 00:29:19,139
- that we can't leave behind.
- May: Yes, you can.

466
00:29:19,174 --> 00:29:23,577
They're dead.
Lash or Andrew ...

467
00:29:23,612 --> 00:29:27,080
honestly, I'm not sure
there's a difference anymore...

468
00:29:27,115 --> 00:29:28,248
he killed them all.

469
00:29:42,197 --> 00:29:46,165
Sir, S.H.I.E.L.D. has
infiltrated the castle,

470
00:29:46,201 --> 00:29:48,501
barricaded themselves
inside the portal chamber.

471
00:29:48,526 --> 00:29:50,293
<i>We need to get you off the premises.</i>

472
00:29:50,338 --> 00:29:53,406
You have less than 15 minutes
to breach their barricades

473
00:29:53,441 --> 00:29:54,807
and regain control of that chamber.

474
00:29:54,843 --> 00:29:57,977
- Sir, I really ...
- That's an order, soldier.

475
00:30:16,865 --> 00:30:18,698
Hold up.

476
00:30:36,859 --> 00:30:38,959
How long before that portal opens?

477
00:30:38,984 --> 00:30:40,884
There's a timer on my watch.

478
00:30:55,169 --> 00:30:57,670
Come on.
We need to move faster.

479
00:30:57,705 --> 00:31:01,206
I could move faster
if you hadn't shot me... twice.

480
00:31:03,711 --> 00:31:04,843
[Loud thud]

481
00:31:04,879 --> 00:31:05,944
What's that?

482
00:31:05,980 --> 00:31:07,779
I'm gonna go out on a
limb and guess Hydra.

483
00:31:07,815 --> 00:31:09,948
We reinforced the barricades,

484
00:31:09,984 --> 00:31:12,084
but it won't take them
long to break through.

485
00:31:12,119 --> 00:31:13,952
[Loud thud]

486
00:31:14,889 --> 00:31:16,188
No way they're taking us again.

487
00:31:16,223 --> 00:31:17,856
We can't destroy it before
Fitz and Coulson return,

488
00:31:17,892 --> 00:31:18,891
not when we're this close.

489
00:31:18,926 --> 00:31:20,959
What if the creature
comes through instead?

490
00:31:20,995 --> 00:31:23,862
- We'll be waiting for them with these.
- And what if we can't kill it?

491
00:31:23,898 --> 00:31:25,931
Can't speak for everyone,
but I'll probably run.

492
00:31:26,066 --> 00:31:29,301
Get everyone through the tunnel
and back up to Zephyr One.

493
00:31:29,326 --> 00:31:31,375
I'm going to stay here until
the last possible second

494
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:32,766
for Coulson, Fitz, and Will.

495
00:31:32,791 --> 00:31:35,525
Now, if Hydra or that alien
thing gets inside here,

496
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:37,493
you light this castle and compound up

497
00:31:37,518 --> 00:31:39,419
- with every missile on that plane.
- Daisy: What? No, I'm not...

498
00:31:39,444 --> 00:31:42,544
Or Bobbi and I can cover
a couple of the barricaded entrances,

499
00:31:42,569 --> 00:31:44,169
buy us enough time
for the portal to open.

500
00:31:44,194 --> 00:31:45,460
Yeah, I'm down with that plan.

501
00:31:45,485 --> 00:31:46,617
if Hydra tries to get through
the barricades, I can ...

502
00:31:46,642 --> 00:31:47,907
<i>Mack: Hey!</i>

503
00:31:47,932 --> 00:31:50,866
What part of "that's an order"
do you not understand?!

504
00:31:52,225 --> 00:31:54,125
Coulson put me in charge
to make the hard call,

505
00:31:54,161 --> 00:31:55,493
and that's what I'm doing.

506
00:31:55,529 --> 00:31:58,296
We can't afford to lose our
best agents in one fell swoop ...

507
00:31:58,331 --> 00:31:59,998
not here, not tonight!

508
00:32:03,470 --> 00:32:08,500
Now, if I don't get out...
May's the new director.

509
00:32:08,575 --> 00:32:11,485
<i>- That's what Coulson would want.
- Okay.</i>

510
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:14,379
But one thing ...
I'm staying with you,

511
00:32:14,414 --> 00:32:17,315
because, "a," I can keep the portal
open if something goes wrong,

512
00:32:17,350 --> 00:32:19,450
and, "b," I'm your partner.

513
00:32:20,899 --> 00:32:23,902
Technically, that's two things.
[Loud thud, rumbling]

514
00:32:24,124 --> 00:32:26,658
Daisy stays.
Everyone else, get the hell out of here!

515
00:32:26,693 --> 00:32:29,025
[Music]

516
00:32:38,638 --> 00:32:42,106
- Is your leg gonna be okay?
- I don't really feel it.

517
00:32:42,142 --> 00:32:44,075
The portal's just over this rise.

518
00:32:44,110 --> 00:32:47,011
It's gonna be close, but I
think we're gonna make it.

519
00:32:48,448 --> 00:32:51,382
Jemma's gonna be
really happy to see you.

520
00:32:51,418 --> 00:32:53,952
This must be very difficult for you.

521
00:32:53,987 --> 00:32:57,939
Getting you off this godforsaken
planet is all that matters...

522
00:33:04,731 --> 00:33:07,365
Jemma never told me there was
an ancient civilization here.

523
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:10,468
[Cellphone beeps] She never saw it.
We're still in the no-fly zone.

524
00:33:10,503 --> 00:33:12,670
[Camera shutter clicking]

525
00:33:17,644 --> 00:33:19,644
[Wind whistling]

526
00:33:22,382 --> 00:33:24,315
What else do you know
about the ancient city?

527
00:33:24,351 --> 00:33:25,984
What happened to it ...
Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa.

528
00:33:26,019 --> 00:33:30,355
Hey, hey. Hang on, hang on.
Let me fix that.

529
00:33:30,390 --> 00:33:33,057
There used to be nine
cities on this planet.

530
00:33:33,093 --> 00:33:34,826
The beings who lived
there were fairly advanced.

531
00:33:34,861 --> 00:33:38,663
But they feared change.
They were easily divided.

532
00:33:38,698 --> 00:33:42,133
They warred among themselves,
destroyed their entire race.

533
00:33:44,905 --> 00:33:46,704
You seem to know a lot about them.

534
00:33:46,740 --> 00:33:49,341
They had a chance to become something

535
00:33:49,342 --> 00:33:53,011
great, something beautiful, but...
in the end...

536
00:33:54,915 --> 00:33:57,515
How do you know so much about ...

537
00:33:59,853 --> 00:34:01,786
Because I was there.

538
00:34:01,821 --> 00:34:03,688
[Exhales sharply]

539
00:34:05,592 --> 00:34:07,525
- You're not Will.
- No.

540
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:12,029
Will died saving Jemma...
from me.

541
00:34:12,030 --> 00:34:14,030
[Music]

542
00:34:15,001 --> 00:34:17,101
Unh!

543
00:34:19,844 --> 00:34:22,636
[Panting]
[Music]

544
00:34:38,163 --> 00:34:40,697
[Breathing heavily]

545
00:34:46,305 --> 00:34:48,705
[Coughing]

546
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:05,821
May: Listen up.
All weapons systems online,

547
00:35:05,856 --> 00:35:07,589
- then take her up to 20,000 feet.
-  Yes, ma'am.

548
00:35:07,624 --> 00:35:08,590
Bobbi.

549
00:35:10,227 --> 00:35:12,661
Looks like Hydra's inside the castle.

550
00:35:12,696 --> 00:35:16,631
They're gonna make it, right?

551
00:35:16,667 --> 00:35:18,934
[Thudding, rumbling]

552
00:35:18,969 --> 00:35:23,138
- Tell me that was you.
- That's just them getting closer.

553
00:35:23,173 --> 00:35:26,341
Okay, tremors, let's hope this works.

554
00:35:45,262 --> 00:35:47,562
[Alarm blaring]

555
00:35:47,597 --> 00:35:50,298
[Rumbling]

556
00:35:54,704 --> 00:35:56,504
[Grunts]

557
00:35:56,540 --> 00:35:57,939
Forgot about this part.

558
00:35:57,974 --> 00:35:59,574
Get out of here. I
can handle everything.

559
00:35:59,609 --> 00:36:01,209
I'm not leaving. I'll be fine.

560
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:06,280
Did you see that?

561
00:36:08,918 --> 00:36:10,918
One minute left.
We don't have much time.

562
00:36:10,954 --> 00:36:13,654
<i>You may have to hold this thing open.</i>

563
00:36:15,091 --> 00:36:17,191
In case you-know-what shows
up instead of our peeps.

564
00:36:17,227 --> 00:36:19,660
Anything other than
our people comes out,

565
00:36:19,696 --> 00:36:21,629
we give May the high sign
and blow it to hell.

566
00:36:21,664 --> 00:36:23,564
Same if Hydra gets in here.

567
00:36:31,641 --> 00:36:33,074
[Grunting]

568
00:36:44,254 --> 00:36:45,853
[Gunshot]

569
00:36:52,729 --> 00:36:54,562
It's open. There's the portal.

570
00:36:54,597 --> 00:36:58,302
- That's good.
- But that's not. Hydra's almost in.

571
00:36:58,768 --> 00:37:00,735
All weapons systems ... go hot.

572
00:37:00,770 --> 00:37:02,937
Stand by for my command.

573
00:37:16,418 --> 00:37:19,920
- How many people?
- Unh!

574
00:37:19,955 --> 00:37:22,055
The lives you've taken.

575
00:37:25,961 --> 00:37:27,494
<i>It's over, Ward.</i>

576
00:37:36,739 --> 00:37:38,639
[Breathes deeply]

577
00:37:53,789 --> 00:37:54,922
[Alarm blaring]

578
00:37:55,285 --> 00:37:56,718
We're out of time.

579
00:38:03,561 --> 00:38:06,786
<i>Coulson!
The portal's closing!</i>

580
00:38:09,043 --> 00:38:11,908
<i>He's finished! Leave him!
Let's go!</i>

581
00:38:12,689 --> 00:38:16,090
Now!
Now! We have to go!

582
00:38:20,827 --> 00:38:22,820
[Music]

583
00:38:28,190 --> 00:38:30,557
[Sighs]
[Bone cracking]

584
00:38:30,592 --> 00:38:34,561
[Gasps, grunts]

585
00:38:42,871 --> 00:38:45,473
[Exhales deeply]

586
00:38:45,474 --> 00:38:48,076
[Music]

587
00:39:28,116 --> 00:39:30,116
<i>Mack: Do it, May! Now!</i>

588
00:39:39,092 --> 00:39:41,514
[Beep]

589
00:39:53,741 --> 00:39:56,420
<i>Mack: Open the doors!
I'm bringing them in!</i>

590

[Music]

591
00:41:36,385 --> 00:41:39,903
[Music]

592
00:41:40,369 --> 00:41:42,640
<i>Man: Sir, your plane is
waiting at the airport.</i>

593
00:41:42,801 --> 00:41:45,881
<i>We'll have you there
in less than 30 minutes.</i>

594
00:41:56,379 --> 00:41:59,322
[Music]

595
00:42:03,018 --> 00:42:06,488
Well, I'll be damned.
