1
00:02:07,527 --> 00:02:09,158
 There comes another one to snatch our rice bowl

2
00:02:09,629 --> 00:02:10,527
Okay, let's practice

3
00:02:11,297 --> 00:02:12,491
Come, get ready

4
00:02:13,199 --> 00:02:13,893
One

5
00:02:14,501 --> 00:02:15,297
Two

6
00:02:15,602 --> 00:02:16,728
One

7
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:18,401
Two

8
00:02:51,404 --> 00:02:53,565
Young master, there is a Master Liao looking for you

9
00:03:05,418 --> 00:03:06,407
This is....

10
00:03:06,986 --> 00:03:08,613
I am the Master of the Liao's Fist

11
00:03:08,922 --> 00:03:10,856
Just opened a dojo in Fuoshan

12
00:03:11,057 --> 00:03:11,921
Congratulations

13
00:03:12,358 --> 00:03:15,589
I heard that your Wing Chun fist is very good

14
00:03:15,929 --> 00:03:19,194
That's why I came here today to get some pointers

15
00:03:19,532 --> 00:03:21,022
Make it another day, okay?

16
00:03:21,301 --> 00:03:22,598
Now is not the right time

17
00:03:22,802 --> 00:03:24,429
Since I am here

18
00:03:24,704 --> 00:03:27,036
and just sparring only, won't take too much time

19
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:31,508
Let's close the doors and spar. Win or lose, nobody will know

20
00:03:31,744 --> 00:03:33,803
It's not a matter of winning or losing,
I am having my meals right now

21
00:03:34,681 --> 00:03:37,149
Then, I'll wait for you

22
00:03:47,093 --> 00:03:50,187
Master Liao, have you eaten?

23
00:03:51,197 --> 00:03:52,687
Come, join us.

24
00:04:29,602 --> 00:04:30,660
You smoke?

25
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:33,129
It's okay

26
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:42,613
How are the dishes tonight?

27
00:04:43,716 --> 00:04:45,081
Good

28
00:04:46,252 --> 00:04:47,082
That is good

29
00:04:52,492 --> 00:04:53,618
Very quick

30
00:05:02,669 --> 00:05:05,661
Uncle Wang, don't clean up the table.
Just close the door first

31
00:05:26,059 --> 00:05:26,991
Master Liao

32
00:05:46,446 --> 00:05:47,174
Please

33
00:05:48,314 --> 00:05:49,110
Please

34
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:18,207
Are you okay?

35
00:06:18,344 --> 00:06:19,402
I'm okay. I'm okay.

36
00:06:20,113 --> 00:06:20,841
One more time

37
00:06:22,248 --> 00:06:23,306
Then, here I come

38
00:06:27,587 --> 00:06:28,246
Hit!

39
00:06:28,755 --> 00:06:30,120
Hit! Hit!

40
00:06:30,623 --> 00:06:31,521
All hits!

41
00:06:33,659 --> 00:06:35,456
Hit!

42
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,007
Thank you for letting me win, Master Liao

43
00:07:04,791 --> 00:07:07,351
Thank you for the lesson. I've learnt a lot
Same here. Same here

44
00:07:09,061 --> 00:07:10,824
Today's closed door sparring.... Master Ip

45
00:07:11,130 --> 00:07:12,995
Don't worry, it'll never leak out

46
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:16,633
Thank you very much. I am taking my leave

47
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:18,968
Do be careful

48
00:07:20,573 --> 00:07:21,733
I am not sending you off

49
00:07:26,078 --> 00:07:28,740
Ip Man's "Heavenly King smashing the tower"
One more time and using the "Four Taels to heave a thousand katis"

50
00:07:29,015 --> 00:07:30,448
that thrown Master Liao's to a thunderous grounding

51
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:32,174
Isn't that stroke used in Tai Chi Quan?

52
00:07:32,385 --> 00:07:34,945
I heard that Mast Ip practice Wing Chun, right?

53
00:07:35,154 --> 00:07:36,485
Whatever! Anyway, he just push him away with just one hand

54
00:07:36,856 --> 00:07:41,122
Master Liao still did not concede defeat
Later, Ip Man ferociously chased after him and beat him up

55
00:07:41,494 --> 00:07:44,292
But Master Liao after being beaten is still not satisfied

56
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:46,489
and uses "Hungry Dog snatch faeces" to beat Ip Man

57
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:53,036
This type of tea leaves is very nice. It's cheap

58
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:56,101
Do be careful
Thank you

59
00:07:56,275 --> 00:07:57,367
Goodbye. See you again the next time

60
00:08:00,913 --> 00:08:03,404
Uncle Ping, who put this here?

61
00:08:03,716 --> 00:08:04,910
It's your younger brother

62
00:08:05,785 --> 00:08:08,310
Initially I thought Master Liao's kung fu is good
but he didn't even have a chance to attack

63
00:08:08,454 --> 00:08:10,319
Being beaten like a pig's head

64
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:13,459
He also have a share in our father's teahouse

65
00:08:13,893 --> 00:08:15,360
Always loitering and fooling around

66
00:08:15,528 --> 00:08:17,496
Ask that asshole to take care of the customers

67
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:18,288
Good morning

68
00:08:18,531 --> 00:08:19,156
Brother Man

69
00:08:20,233 --> 00:08:21,131
Is Brother Quan is here?

70
00:08:21,267 --> 00:08:22,199
He's waiting for you upstairs

71
00:08:25,538 --> 00:08:27,472
Ah Quan, have you been waiting long?

72
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:28,898
You are always late

73
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:31,204
Busy!

74
00:08:32,645 --> 00:08:33,339
Busy with what?

75
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:37,947
It's always the same.
Eat, drink and kung fu

76
00:08:38,784 --> 00:08:39,944
What's there to be busy about?

77
00:08:42,922 --> 00:08:44,150
This tea is quite fragrant

78
00:08:45,424 --> 00:08:46,891
I am saying you!

79
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,422
Let's order some food

80
00:08:49,996 --> 00:08:51,429
I've something to discuss with you

81
00:08:51,797 --> 00:08:53,264
Eat first, we'll talk later

82
00:08:53,499 --> 00:08:56,468
Fresh from the oven. Come, try it!

83
00:08:57,036 --> 00:08:59,004
I heard them say,
you had a duel with Master Liao

84
00:08:59,338 --> 00:09:01,863
and quickly defeated him
Is that true?

85
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:03,740
Who told you, Crazy Lin

86
00:09:04,277 --> 00:09:05,301
My younger brother

87
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:09,409
You should have told me earlier
I've even ask him to be my master

88
00:09:10,349 --> 00:09:12,078
You've ask every master in town to be your master

89
00:09:12,451 --> 00:09:15,477
Brother Man, did you have a closed door duel?

90
00:09:16,622 --> 00:09:18,783
We've something to discuss. Please go

91
00:09:19,125 --> 00:09:20,956
Then, I will not disturb your discussion

92
00:09:35,841 --> 00:09:36,500
Good morning Master

93
00:09:36,909 --> 00:09:37,898
Good morning Master
Good morning

94
00:09:38,277 --> 00:09:39,301
Master
Good morning

95
00:09:40,546 --> 00:09:41,444
Good morning Master
Good morning

96
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:44,243
Master, someone said you got beaten by Ip Man

97
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:46,279
Now, everyone in Fuoshan knows about it

98
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:47,249
Nonsense, who said it?

99
00:09:47,453 --> 00:09:48,852
Sha Dan Yuan from the teahouse

100
00:09:52,091 --> 00:09:53,649
The cost of things in Fuoshan have risen

101
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:54,892
So what about it?

102
00:09:57,163 --> 00:09:59,791
That is to say, Fuoshan's economy is good

103
00:10:00,199 --> 00:10:02,064
Everyone have expendable income

104
00:10:02,868 --> 00:10:03,562
Really?

105
00:10:04,236 --> 00:10:07,137
Think about it! Clothes, food, accommodation and travels. Clothes comes first

106
00:10:09,508 --> 00:10:13,103
In future, the demand for cloth will be huge

107
00:10:13,579 --> 00:10:16,980
That is why I want to set up a cotton factory
so that I can supply them to the cloth factory

108
00:10:20,853 --> 00:10:22,081
I want you to be my partner

109
00:10:23,356 --> 00:10:24,846
I am not suitable for business

110
00:10:25,157 --> 00:10:26,647
It's okay, I am suitable

111
00:10:26,993 --> 00:10:28,153
I am not in need money

112
00:10:30,029 --> 00:10:31,826
Who is Sha Dan Yuan? Get the hell out here!

113
00:10:32,031 --> 00:10:32,998
I am

114
00:10:38,304 --> 00:10:40,602
You're the one talking nonsense and ruining my reputation?
Master

115
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:42,765
I want to teach you a lesson today
Master Master

116
00:10:43,743 --> 00:10:46,109
He's my younger brother. Let's talk slowly

117
00:10:46,278 --> 00:10:47,506
Don't get angry, master

118
00:10:48,247 --> 00:10:48,770
Your brother

119
00:10:48,981 --> 00:10:50,642
Your brother is talking nonsense and ruined my reputation

120
00:10:51,617 --> 00:10:53,107
Said I lost to Ip Man in a fight

121
00:10:53,352 --> 00:10:55,445
Tell me, how can I survive in Dojo Street?

122
00:10:55,621 --> 00:10:57,054
How can I open my dojo and take in students?

123
00:10:57,223 --> 00:10:58,190
Master! Apologize now!

124
00:10:58,891 --> 00:11:00,722
I am not in the wrong. I just stating facts

125
00:11:00,893 --> 00:11:02,690
You're talking nonsense
Sifu

126
00:11:03,362 --> 00:11:06,763
Ip Man is upstairs. If you've got the balls, go find him!

127
00:11:07,566 --> 00:11:08,999
What! Go!

128
00:11:10,703 --> 00:11:12,102
Sifu, cool down, cool down

129
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:18,105
Sifu Sifu  Don't get angry. Sifu

130
00:11:20,279 --> 00:11:21,803
Master Ip, I've been wronged!

131
00:11:22,281 --> 00:11:23,714
Sifu Sifu

132
00:11:23,883 --> 00:11:24,815
Please, tell everyone

133
00:11:24,917 --> 00:11:26,885
that you have a duel with Master Liao
and beaten him

134
00:11:34,727 --> 00:11:38,026
Master Ip, you must clear my name

135
00:11:40,599 --> 00:11:42,567
Still telling lies!? And troubling Brother Man!

136
00:11:43,969 --> 00:11:45,163
I did not lie

137
00:11:45,371 --> 00:11:47,566
When I was retrieving my kite, I saw them fighting

138
00:11:47,807 --> 00:11:51,334
What a coincidence that your kite broke loose
and landed in Brother Man's garden

139
00:11:51,677 --> 00:11:54,009
and what a coincidence that you saw Master Liao and Brother Man having a duel

140
00:11:54,213 --> 00:11:56,147
and coincidentally, the whole scene was seen by you?!

141
00:11:56,348 --> 00:11:57,576
There is just too much coincidences!

142
00:11:57,750 --> 00:11:58,978
Yes, it's all coincidences

143
00:11:59,351 --> 00:12:01,649
Even if it's true, you can't go around telling everyone

144
00:12:01,921 --> 00:12:02,853
There are some things which one can't admit

145
00:12:03,022 --> 00:12:03,920
If it's true then one won't be afraid to admit it

146
00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:05,216
If one admits one would lose face

147
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:07,052
Lose what face? How should I know?

148
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:11,624
This is called " Lose face"

149
00:12:15,134 --> 00:12:17,568
Crazy Lin, no need to be like this

150
00:12:17,837 --> 00:12:19,964
What are you laughing at!
Don't treat me like I am not around!

151
00:12:21,073 --> 00:12:22,563
Sir, it's a small matter

152
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:23,367
What small matter?

153
00:12:23,542 --> 00:12:24,372
Disperse...

154
00:12:24,543 --> 00:12:25,271
Don't go!

155
00:12:25,945 --> 00:12:26,969
Sir, small matter

156
00:12:27,113 --> 00:12:29,308
I've seen everything. Let me tell all of you

157
00:12:30,015 --> 00:12:32,210
whoever create trouble in my territory, not obeying the law

158
00:12:32,318 --> 00:12:33,410
I will arrest them

159
00:12:33,552 --> 00:12:37,511
I didn't come here to create trouble
It's someone who ruined my reputation

160
00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:38,714
I am here for justice

161
00:12:38,858 --> 00:12:41,190
What justice? I am justice

162
00:12:42,228 --> 00:12:45,322
You bunch of loafers, fighting everyday

163
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:46,826
What era is it now?

164
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,999
Still going for duels!

165
00:12:49,368 --> 00:12:52,701
Let's duel with weapons. Gun! Gun!

166
00:12:52,805 --> 00:12:54,773
Do you know?!

167
00:13:17,596 --> 00:13:18,927
You also know, Inspector Lee

168
00:13:19,365 --> 00:13:24,667
we, practitioners of martial arts have lots of energy
and sometimes may be loud in our speech

169
00:13:25,004 --> 00:13:27,268
But being loud in our speech does not mean that we have no manners

170
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:32,137
Technically, we are all cultured people
No need to draw your gun for any small matter

171
00:13:32,912 --> 00:13:34,004
Give me some face

172
00:13:34,947 --> 00:13:37,438
Crazy Lin, take care of Insp. Lee. All on me

173
00:13:37,583 --> 00:13:38,641
Good

174
00:13:38,751 --> 00:13:40,218
Insp. Lee, this way please

175
00:13:40,586 --> 00:13:42,520
What are you looking at? Quick scram

176
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:43,781
Don't look! All disperse

177
00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:45,623
Insp. Lee, please

178
00:13:49,361 --> 00:13:50,157
Master Liao

179
00:13:51,597 --> 00:13:52,689
Take care

180
00:13:57,336 --> 00:13:58,769
Why are you so secretive?

181
00:14:01,207 --> 00:14:02,970
I am really not suitable to do business

182
00:14:06,011 --> 00:14:09,947
Take it and open the factory.
When you have profit then you can pay me

183
00:14:12,084 --> 00:14:13,915
I won't be able to repay you so quickly

184
00:14:14,753 --> 00:14:16,118
Take your time to pay

185
00:14:17,289 --> 00:14:20,224
Do me one more favor. Accept my son as your student

186
00:14:21,126 --> 00:14:23,890
There are so many Masters in Dojo Street
just ask any of them will do

187
00:14:25,231 --> 00:14:27,358
Those masters are not as good as you

188
00:14:27,967 --> 00:14:29,025
About the same

189
00:14:30,536 --> 00:14:31,468
Crazy Lin

190
00:14:32,471 --> 00:14:33,233
Brother Quan

191
00:14:33,772 --> 00:14:37,230
Brother Man, I've learned a new technique
You help me to test it, alright?

192
00:14:37,943 --> 00:14:40,036
You're so free!
Have you found your younger brother yet?

193
00:14:40,279 --> 00:14:43,077
Don't worry about him. Once his money is depleted,
he'll come back

194
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:45,342
Let's try

195
00:14:46,919 --> 00:14:48,944
Father, is Uncle Man willing?

196
00:14:49,822 --> 00:14:51,289
You go and have a look first

197
00:14:56,362 --> 00:14:58,626
Ah June, your drawings are so beautiful

198
00:14:58,764 --> 00:15:00,459
Let's see what moves you've learn this time

199
00:15:03,402 --> 00:15:05,165
It has defense when attacking and in defense there is element of attacking

200
00:15:05,337 --> 00:15:06,895
when attacking there is defense and in defense there is attack

201
00:15:08,173 --> 00:15:09,663
The words you say are all the same

202
00:15:09,808 --> 00:15:11,639
You won't understand, kid. Go further away

203
00:15:24,990 --> 00:15:27,720
This move is to attack the middle section.
Very deadly

204
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:30,522
Don't just know how to say the words
Most important is to get a hit

205
00:15:30,663 --> 00:15:32,654
Mother, I've finished drawing

206
00:15:33,699 --> 00:15:36,099
It's so good. Let Daddy have a look

207
00:15:36,235 --> 00:15:37,133
Okay

208
00:15:37,403 --> 00:15:38,768
Use attack as defense. Continued defense is attack

209
00:15:38,904 --> 00:15:40,531
That's what I do
What I did earlier on is constant defense

210
00:15:40,673 --> 00:15:41,662
Daddy, have a look

211
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:42,829
Daddy is not free. Later...

212
00:15:43,642 --> 00:15:44,233
Don't understand

213
00:15:44,543 --> 00:15:45,009
Yes

214
00:15:45,177 --> 00:15:45,973
One more time

215
00:15:46,378 --> 00:15:47,106
One more time

216
00:15:49,248 --> 00:15:51,580
Daddy won't look

217
00:15:57,222 --> 00:15:58,314
You've already lost
What?

218
00:16:00,726 --> 00:16:01,920
This is called constant defense with attack

219
00:16:02,027 --> 00:16:03,517
Master Ip, one more time. I didn't see clearly

220
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:05,119
See! See! See! What's there to see!?

221
00:16:05,364 --> 00:16:07,628
Come here everyday and fight, fight fight!
Really frustrating!

222
00:16:12,538 --> 00:16:13,630
Brother Man, what now?

223
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:21,603
Sister-in-law, I am sorry

224
00:16:25,551 --> 00:16:27,075
Sister-in-law, I am leaving

225
00:16:27,553 --> 00:16:28,679
I am not saying you

226
00:16:28,954 --> 00:16:31,218
No, there are lots of things to do in the factory

227
00:16:34,593 --> 00:16:35,423
Ah Yeow

228
00:16:38,664 --> 00:16:39,858
Uncle Man, we are leaving

229
00:16:40,032 --> 00:16:41,397
Okay, come again the next time

230
00:16:44,703 --> 00:16:45,635
We're leaving

231
00:16:51,143 --> 00:16:55,307
If you are not happy, you can tell me.
No need to throw your temper

232
00:16:56,382 --> 00:16:59,579
Okay. I am asking you now to look at the son's drawings

233
00:16:59,785 --> 00:17:03,186
Show more concern
and don't stay with your friends all day

234
00:17:05,457 --> 00:17:06,651
Let's go in, okay?

235
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:09,687
Slowly

236
00:17:35,521 --> 00:17:36,180
Brother

237
00:17:36,822 --> 00:17:38,016
Where is Dojo Street?

238
00:17:38,257 --> 00:17:38,951
Ah...

239
00:17:39,124 --> 00:17:40,022
Dojo

240
00:17:40,692 --> 00:17:41,750
Go straight ahead

241
00:18:07,686 --> 00:18:09,017
One
Two

242
00:18:09,321 --> 00:18:10,618
One
Two

243
00:18:10,856 --> 00:18:12,346
One
Two

244
00:18:13,358 --> 00:18:14,916
One
Two

245
00:18:19,198 --> 00:18:21,758
Boss, there are so many dojos,
which one shall we start first?

246
00:18:22,401 --> 00:18:23,663
One
Two

247
00:18:24,069 --> 00:18:25,969
One, retract

248
00:18:26,505 --> 00:18:28,439
Brother! Teaching kung fu?

249
00:18:28,874 --> 00:18:30,967
You guys came here to learn kung fu?
Come in, let's talk

250
00:18:31,276 --> 00:18:32,641
Who is the Dojo master?

251
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:35,876
I am the dojo master

252
00:18:36,181 --> 00:18:37,580
I am Jin Shan Zhao

253
00:18:37,749 --> 00:18:40,616
I've long admired Fuoshan as the town of martial arts. I came south especially

254
00:18:40,786 --> 00:18:44,187
and would like to exchange pointers with Masters of Fuoshan.

255
00:18:45,891 --> 00:18:47,381
Exchange pointers!

256
00:18:47,526 --> 00:18:48,458
Correct

257
00:18:49,495 --> 00:18:51,429
Then you are here to challenge!?

258
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:53,359
Yes

259
00:18:53,665 --> 00:18:54,427
Okay

260
00:18:54,867 --> 00:18:59,065
All of you stand one side
See how your master teach this country bumpkin a lesson

261
00:18:59,238 --> 00:19:01,103
Not that side. This side! This side!

262
00:19:02,774 --> 00:19:03,934
Someone here to challenge!

263
00:19:04,443 --> 00:19:05,375
What is it?

264
00:19:06,612 --> 00:19:07,704
Look and learn

265
00:19:54,026 --> 00:19:55,584
Boss! Boss! You're terrific!

266
00:20:07,139 --> 00:20:08,128
Where is your Master?

267
00:20:08,707 --> 00:20:09,696
I am here!

268
00:21:00,959 --> 00:21:02,756
You really want to kill me, huh!?

269
00:21:07,532 --> 00:21:08,430
Sifu is not here

270
00:21:38,797 --> 00:21:42,426
Wondered what happen to the weather in Fuoshan
blowing cold and hot

271
00:21:45,404 --> 00:21:46,371
Let me

272
00:21:53,812 --> 00:21:55,211
What are you drawing, Ah June?

273
00:21:59,418 --> 00:22:00,851
Ah June is not talking to you

274
00:22:00,986 --> 00:22:02,647
If you are free, do keep him company

275
00:22:04,056 --> 00:22:05,045
Okay

276
00:22:16,601 --> 00:22:18,228
Crazy Lin, so early?

277
00:22:19,571 --> 00:22:22,335
Sister-in-law, I am not here to fight.
Just have a few words and I'll leave

278
00:22:32,084 --> 00:22:33,142
Hey, what is it?

279
00:22:34,486 --> 00:22:36,647
There are a bunch of country bumpkins
going around challenging all the dojos

280
00:22:36,822 --> 00:22:40,155
Their kung fu is good
Every dojos have lost

281
00:22:40,592 --> 00:22:41,854
If you can, do go and have a look

282
00:22:43,195 --> 00:22:44,162
Really that good?

283
00:22:44,296 --> 00:22:45,024
Yes

284
00:22:49,801 --> 00:22:51,325
Sister-in-law, I am leaving now

285
00:23:39,184 --> 00:23:40,378
Hang on, Master Liao

286
00:23:40,519 --> 00:23:41,781
We're all depending on you, Master Liao

287
00:24:07,612 --> 00:24:08,510
Fucking bitch!

288
00:24:09,714 --> 00:24:11,705
There is not one who can fight in Fuoshan

289
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:17,315
I thought everyone in Fuoshan is like Wong Fei Hung

290
00:24:17,689 --> 00:24:18,883
but actually they are worms

291
00:24:19,291 --> 00:24:21,384
All weaklings, can't even stand one blow

292
00:24:22,093 --> 00:24:24,061
Brothers, we didn't come here for nothing

293
00:24:24,262 --> 00:24:25,923
There is not one who can fight in Fuoshan

294
00:24:26,131 --> 00:24:27,496
This time we're going to get rich

295
00:24:29,167 --> 00:24:31,658
Brothers, we've got to keep working hard

296
00:24:31,870 --> 00:24:35,237
Open a martial art school in Fuoshan
and let them know how good we are

297
00:24:36,041 --> 00:24:37,975
We got to be number one in Fuoshan

298
00:24:39,010 --> 00:24:42,275
You, country bumpkins!
Won a few masters and you think you are damn good

299
00:24:42,414 --> 00:24:43,938
Win the best, then we'll say

300
00:24:46,251 --> 00:24:47,684
Who is the best in Fuoshan

301
00:24:47,886 --> 00:24:49,376
Of course it's Ip Man. Do you think it's me?

302
00:24:57,162 --> 00:24:58,129
Let's go

303
00:24:58,296 --> 00:24:59,661
Come! Come!

304
00:24:59,931 --> 00:25:01,398
See how we are going to win Ip Man

305
00:25:25,857 --> 00:25:28,121
Daddy, there is a lot of people outside

306
00:25:35,934 --> 00:25:36,992
Young Master, they....

307
00:25:37,135 --> 00:25:38,067
You are Ip Man?

308
00:25:39,671 --> 00:25:42,231
I am Jin Shan Zhao.
I've heard that Fuoshan is the town of martial arts

309
00:25:42,507 --> 00:25:43,667
I know, Master Jin, I know

310
00:25:44,276 --> 00:25:47,268
You've brought so many people
to tell me that you want to challenge me, right?

311
00:25:47,379 --> 00:25:48,346
Of course!

312
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:51,779
We are opening a dojo in Fuoshan
We have to show our ability to them

313
00:25:52,284 --> 00:25:54,980
Opening a dojo, right?
If you want to open a dojo, you don't have to fight with me

314
00:25:55,086 --> 00:25:58,146
You just have to find a good location and that's it.
Please leave.

315
00:26:02,661 --> 00:26:04,891
Uncle Wang, bring Ah June in

316
00:26:05,797 --> 00:26:06,661
Ip Man

317
00:26:08,099 --> 00:26:11,500
Don't give any excuses
Are you afraid and don't want to fight

318
00:26:14,639 --> 00:26:16,664
Fight! Fight! Fight!
Do you think my house is a dojo?!

319
00:26:16,775 --> 00:26:18,470
Do you think you can just come in and fight and kill?
Get out!

320
00:26:19,144 --> 00:26:21,203
You heard her. I won't fight with you

321
00:26:21,446 --> 00:26:22,606
Please leave immediately

322
00:26:23,515 --> 00:26:26,211
I heard that Wing Chun fist is developed by a woman

323
00:26:26,518 --> 00:26:28,042
I think it's very suitable for you

324
00:26:28,587 --> 00:26:31,283
Ip Man, you're really henpecked

325
00:26:32,624 --> 00:26:34,558
There is not anyone that is afraid of their wives

326
00:26:35,026 --> 00:26:36,789
but men who respect their wives

327
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:41,593
Mrs. Ip, don't worry.
I won't kill him

328
00:26:44,803 --> 00:26:47,431
If you are afraid that he would lose,
I'll use one hand

329
00:26:48,406 --> 00:26:50,931
If not,
I will not use both my hands

330
00:26:52,043 --> 00:26:54,307
Master Ip, fight

331
00:26:54,446 --> 00:26:56,573
Fuoshan have really disappointed me

332
00:26:56,915 --> 00:26:58,246
There are so many martial arts
practitioner but there is none

333
00:26:58,416 --> 00:26:59,144
Shut up!

334
00:27:01,953 --> 00:27:03,682
Don't break anything in the house

335
00:27:11,663 --> 00:27:12,391
Give way! Give way! Give way!

336
00:27:13,098 --> 00:27:13,996
Give way! Give way!

337
00:27:22,007 --> 00:27:22,837
You bunch of....

338
00:27:22,974 --> 00:27:25,101
You came at the right time.
This is a small place

339
00:27:25,377 --> 00:27:28,710
Please ask all the people to go out
and please close the door on your way out

340
00:27:34,019 --> 00:27:35,486
You must win back our reputation

341
00:27:38,123 --> 00:27:39,715
Let them go out!
Quick!

342
00:27:41,393 --> 00:27:43,691
Faster! Faster! Out!

343
00:27:43,995 --> 00:27:46,691
Out! Out!

344
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:04,440
Wing Chun, Ip Man

345
00:28:05,517 --> 00:28:06,575
I really like to see

346
00:28:08,186 --> 00:28:12,054
how a macho man
uses a woman's martial arts

347
00:28:13,625 --> 00:28:16,287
Good kung fu does not have sex or age differentiation

348
00:28:16,628 --> 00:28:19,688
Have to see who is using it
You will know immediately how it is fought

349
00:28:21,266 --> 00:28:22,164
Please

350
00:28:59,437 --> 00:29:00,301
I'll pay

351
00:29:01,806 --> 00:29:02,602
Good

352
00:29:05,877 --> 00:29:07,344
How is it? How is it?

353
00:29:07,445 --> 00:29:08,469
Who is better?

354
00:29:20,625 --> 00:29:21,592
I'll pay

355
00:29:28,466 --> 00:29:29,626
Daddy, mummy says

356
00:29:29,768 --> 00:29:33,704
if you won't attack,
all the things in the house will be broken

357
00:29:33,805 --> 00:29:34,772
Okay...

358
00:29:38,176 --> 00:29:39,302
Little rascal!

359
00:29:39,677 --> 00:29:40,905
Be careful what you say!

360
00:29:56,361 --> 00:29:57,259
Boss

361
00:30:18,683 --> 00:30:19,377
Boss

362
00:30:19,684 --> 00:30:21,345
Boss Boss

363
00:30:26,658 --> 00:30:28,990
Master Jin, are you alright?

364
00:30:29,661 --> 00:30:30,787
I am okay

365
00:31:58,683 --> 00:32:01,447
How is it, Master Jin?
Do you think my kung fu is okay?

366
00:32:01,819 --> 00:32:02,649
No need to say

367
00:32:04,289 --> 00:32:07,816
Today, the northern fist
have lost to the southern fist

368
00:32:09,327 --> 00:32:13,661
You're wrong. The problem lies not within Northern or Southern Fist
It lies within you

369
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:23,064
Who lost and who won?

370
00:32:23,841 --> 00:32:27,299
No need to ask. Look at his pig face
you'll know that he had lost

371
00:32:27,879 --> 00:32:29,107
Scram!

372
00:32:36,454 --> 00:32:37,113
Sifu

373
00:32:37,522 --> 00:32:38,716
Brother Man Okay, good show
Master Ip

374
00:32:39,290 --> 00:32:41,281
You have saved the reputation of all the dojos in Fuoshan

375
00:32:41,392 --> 00:32:42,825
It's luck. It's luck

376
00:32:42,927 --> 00:32:45,589
I would say that you are the jewel of Kwangtung

377
00:32:50,335 --> 00:32:51,131
Thank you

378
00:32:51,536 --> 00:32:53,504
This has just been imported from overseas.
Please, look around

379
00:32:53,604 --> 00:32:54,593
Mr. Ip, this is your wife's flowers
Thank you

380
00:32:54,939 --> 00:32:55,906
Boss, how much is it?

381
00:32:56,007 --> 00:32:57,167
No need money, Master Ip

382
00:32:57,308 --> 00:32:59,469
You've brought glory to the people of Fuoshan
How can I take your money?

383
00:32:59,777 --> 00:33:00,607
I can't don't pay?

384
00:33:00,712 --> 00:33:02,202
You're doing business, right?
Really, there's no need to pay, Master Ip

385
00:33:02,347 --> 00:33:03,507
You're too kind
Don't be

386
00:33:03,648 --> 00:33:04,740
The next time
Okay, the next time

387
00:33:05,116 --> 00:33:06,811
Master Ip, have some fruits
So kind

388
00:33:06,951 --> 00:33:09,078
For the kids
How could you...

389
00:33:09,187 --> 00:33:10,381
Goodbye, Master Ip
Thank you

390
00:33:10,521 --> 00:33:12,318
Little friend, for you to play

391
00:33:12,423 --> 00:33:13,685
Say, thanks

392
00:33:13,791 --> 00:33:15,156
Thank you
No need to

393
00:33:15,293 --> 00:33:16,191
Thank you
Take care

394
00:33:17,195 --> 00:33:18,685
Master Ip, how are you?

395
00:33:18,763 --> 00:33:19,855
Master Ip, how are you?
Mrs. Su, how are you?

396
00:33:19,964 --> 00:33:20,862
This is not bad

397
00:33:20,999 --> 00:33:23,627
This is the best in our shop

398
00:33:23,801 --> 00:33:27,259
If this could be in your house
it would be my honor

399
00:33:27,405 --> 00:33:28,429
You're kind

400
00:33:30,475 --> 00:33:31,601
Why is it so crowded?

401
00:33:32,276 --> 00:33:33,766
Uncle Man, Auntie

402
00:33:33,978 --> 00:33:35,172
You are so sly

403
00:33:35,313 --> 00:33:38,373
If you want to open a dojo
Why didn't you inform me first?

404
00:33:38,483 --> 00:33:40,041
When did I say I want to open a dojo?

405
00:33:40,485 --> 00:33:42,146
The whole of Fuoshan knows about it

406
00:33:42,253 --> 00:33:44,721
Everyone in Fuoshan knows, except me

407
00:33:45,790 --> 00:33:47,223
Uncle Man, let me help you

408
00:33:54,098 --> 00:33:55,929
Sifu  Master

409
00:33:56,267 --> 00:33:56,926
Fellow disciples

410
00:33:57,035 --> 00:33:58,969
Looks like you're the one who spread the rumor

411
00:33:59,170 --> 00:34:00,535
You've better fix this mess

412
00:34:01,873 --> 00:34:03,431
Come, walk yourself

413
00:34:05,610 --> 00:34:09,046
I don't care
Ah Yeow must be your first student

414
00:34:09,147 --> 00:34:11,411
There you go again.
This is not the first day you know me

415
00:34:11,549 --> 00:34:12,846
I'll never accept any disciples

416
00:34:13,051 --> 00:34:13,881
Quiet!

417
00:34:15,019 --> 00:34:18,682
We must observe rules.
Once we observe rules, it will be right!

418
00:34:18,890 --> 00:34:21,791
Master Ip Master Ip

419
00:34:21,993 --> 00:34:26,157
Master Ip Master Ip

420
00:37:17,568 --> 00:37:19,763
Wing Seng, I am going out for awhile.
Will be back soon

421
00:37:19,937 --> 00:37:20,835
Wait

422
00:37:35,186 --> 00:37:37,416
It's cold outside. Wear one more

423
00:37:47,898 --> 00:37:48,557
Ip June

424
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:51,760
Ip June, be careful.
Don't hurt others

425
00:38:18,696 --> 00:38:20,459
Master Ip, I gave you a bit more

426
00:38:20,598 --> 00:38:21,565
Thank you very much

427
00:38:24,235 --> 00:38:25,361
No need to rush

428
00:38:26,037 --> 00:38:27,732
Next! You take this

429
00:38:28,005 --> 00:38:29,131
Once you have taken, leave immediately

430
00:38:31,008 --> 00:38:32,942
One by one. Line up

431
00:38:50,795 --> 00:38:53,992
This factory might be old but it's still not bad

432
00:38:59,970 --> 00:39:01,665
Fuoshan is now in a mass of confusion

433
00:39:02,173 --> 00:39:03,936
You've gone. Why come back?

434
00:39:04,775 --> 00:39:07,005
If I don't come back,
where would the workers have money to eat

435
00:39:07,244 --> 00:39:08,836
My money is all invested here

436
00:39:11,015 --> 00:39:12,175
I still can't pay you now

437
00:39:13,718 --> 00:39:16,949
No need
If you don't say, I would have forgotten about it

438
00:39:17,221 --> 00:39:19,746
This can't be.
I'll treat it that you have invested here

439
00:39:20,024 --> 00:39:23,892
It might be little but it still have 10% of the shares

440
00:39:24,295 --> 00:39:25,319
Really, there's no need

441
00:39:25,663 --> 00:39:28,894
Stay and help me.
After all you have a share in it

442
00:39:31,268 --> 00:39:31,962
Uncle Man

443
00:39:32,570 --> 00:39:33,332
Kwong Yeow

444
00:39:33,571 --> 00:39:35,198
You're here to help? That's great!

445
00:39:35,306 --> 00:39:37,331
With you to lead us,
everyone would be more energetic

446
00:39:37,775 --> 00:39:39,800
and I can also watch you practice Wing Chun fist

447
00:39:39,944 --> 00:39:42,936
Stay and have your meals here.
The workers are about to have theirs

448
00:39:43,647 --> 00:39:45,012
Yes, join us

449
00:39:45,850 --> 00:39:46,874
No need

450
00:39:47,451 --> 00:39:50,420
I still have things to do.
Next time

451
00:39:50,588 --> 00:39:51,486
I am leaving now

452
00:40:02,433 --> 00:40:04,196
Father, why don't you ask Uncle Man to stay

453
00:40:05,870 --> 00:40:07,235
I understand him all too well

454
00:40:15,613 --> 00:40:18,207
Daddy, didn't you always practice martial arts?

455
00:40:18,315 --> 00:40:20,249
Why didn't you practice nowadays?

456
00:40:21,285 --> 00:40:22,980
If daddy move too much, daddy would get hungry

457
00:40:23,387 --> 00:40:25,321
That's why I move less, right?

458
00:40:25,689 --> 00:40:26,917
Uh, I understand

459
00:40:27,057 --> 00:40:29,457
Then I won't go out and play

460
00:40:30,694 --> 00:40:33,219
You will only stop playing today. Quick, eat

461
00:40:33,364 --> 00:40:33,989
Quick, eat

462
00:40:43,974 --> 00:40:45,373
This porridge is a bit starchy

463
00:40:47,278 --> 00:40:48,836
but somehow you have to eat something

464
00:40:49,914 --> 00:40:50,846
Come

465
00:40:55,419 --> 00:40:56,545
Careful, it's hot

466
00:41:04,595 --> 00:41:06,256
How much rice are there in the house

467
00:41:07,531 --> 00:41:08,520
Don't have to worry

468
00:41:14,939 --> 00:41:18,602
Whatever valuables in the house have been pawned

469
00:41:19,810 --> 00:41:23,439
Your husband have strength and energy
I can go out and get a job

470
00:41:24,014 --> 00:41:24,981
Won't die

471
00:41:26,450 --> 00:41:27,883
You go out and work?

472
00:41:28,752 --> 00:41:30,413
Of course I have no need to before

473
00:41:31,188 --> 00:41:34,624
but now times are bad
There is always a first time

474
00:41:39,163 --> 00:41:42,894
We have more than enough people here
Not hiring anymore

475
00:41:46,303 --> 00:41:48,271
Boss, do you require any worker?

476
00:41:48,405 --> 00:41:49,838
No. We've enough

477
00:41:50,107 --> 00:41:50,835
Sorry to trouble you

478
00:41:53,244 --> 00:41:56,077
Boss, employ me

479
00:41:58,849 --> 00:42:01,340
You! You! You! Come up

480
00:42:01,485 --> 00:42:03,646
Boss! Boss!

481
00:42:07,458 --> 00:42:08,982
Master Ip, you're looking for a job?

482
00:42:09,093 --> 00:42:10,117
Come Come

483
00:42:10,528 --> 00:42:11,552
Thank you

484
00:42:40,457 --> 00:42:41,287
Brother Man

485
00:42:49,133 --> 00:42:51,658
Brother Man, the way you dress is not suitable for work

486
00:42:52,770 --> 00:42:54,533
How do I know that I'll be digging for coal?!

487
00:42:55,606 --> 00:42:57,005
Master Ip, how are you?

488
00:42:57,474 --> 00:42:58,566
How are you?

489
00:43:00,678 --> 00:43:01,838
Master Ip, how are you?

490
00:43:05,549 --> 00:43:06,914
Why are there so many masters here?

491
00:43:07,785 --> 00:43:10,618
Right! The boss here used to practice martial arts

492
00:43:10,754 --> 00:43:14,155
That's why he like to employ
those who knows kung fu

493
00:43:15,693 --> 00:43:16,853
Do you still practice kung fu?

494
00:43:18,495 --> 00:43:20,827
If there is time,
I would come out and look for work, right?

495
00:43:22,333 --> 00:43:23,265
Go there and eat

496
00:43:23,367 --> 00:43:24,026
Okay

497
00:43:39,550 --> 00:43:42,678
Brother Man, I can't eat anymore
Help me to eat some, okay?

498
00:43:43,587 --> 00:43:44,485
Eat a little

499
00:43:50,361 --> 00:43:53,228
How are sister-in-law and Ah June?

500
00:43:54,064 --> 00:43:55,691
They're fine. Thanks

501
00:43:58,469 --> 00:44:00,266
Have you found your younger brother?

502
00:44:00,471 --> 00:44:02,530
I haven't seen him since the last time he left

503
00:44:02,973 --> 00:44:04,201
I don't know if he is dead or alive

504
00:44:06,343 --> 00:44:07,674
I don't have a chance even to apologize

505
00:44:15,786 --> 00:44:16,616
You lost something?

506
00:44:16,887 --> 00:44:19,014
Yes, I've lost a steel box

507
00:44:19,156 --> 00:44:20,054
What kind of steel box

508
00:44:20,624 --> 00:44:21,488
Japanese soldiers!

509
00:44:22,126 --> 00:44:23,320
Japanese soldiers are coming!

510
00:44:42,279 --> 00:44:46,045
Fellow workers, this is Colonel Chuodeng

511
00:44:46,850 --> 00:44:49,216
The colonel admires Chinese kung fu

512
00:44:49,586 --> 00:44:51,611
and also knows that Fuoshan is the town of martial arts

513
00:44:52,389 --> 00:44:56,587
and like to find those who knows kung fu
and spar with the Japanese

514
00:44:57,661 --> 00:44:58,889
Are there anyone who is willing to go?

515
00:44:59,563 --> 00:45:00,689
Are there anyone who is willing to go?

516
00:45:04,968 --> 00:45:06,629
Are there anyone who is willing to go?

517
00:45:13,143 --> 00:45:14,167
Master

518
00:45:18,849 --> 00:45:20,942
You just want us to be their sand bags

519
00:45:21,118 --> 00:45:22,847
Let me tell you, no way!

520
00:45:25,122 --> 00:45:28,751
Idiot! If you win there is a bag of rice

521
00:45:31,662 --> 00:45:35,393
Those who wins the fight will be awarded a bag of rice

522
00:45:35,499 --> 00:45:36,397
I'll go

523
00:45:37,534 --> 00:45:40,162
Crazy Lin, don't look for trouble

524
00:45:40,304 --> 00:45:41,032
I'll go

525
00:45:41,705 --> 00:45:42,433
I'll go too

526
00:45:42,673 --> 00:45:45,107
No, they have stolen our rice

527
00:45:45,242 --> 00:45:47,710
now is our chance to take it back. It's only fair

528
00:45:48,112 --> 00:45:49,272
Hey! Hey!

529
00:45:52,349 --> 00:45:53,281
Forget it!

530
00:45:54,184 --> 00:45:55,481
Help me find the steel box.

531
00:45:56,120 --> 00:45:57,109
Hey!

532
00:45:59,656 --> 00:46:01,954
It's alright. Come

533
00:46:02,693 --> 00:46:03,591
Be careful

534
00:46:03,727 --> 00:46:04,625
Come, come over and line up

535
00:46:05,462 --> 00:46:06,520
Quick

536
00:46:07,264 --> 00:46:09,061
Are there any more orders?

537
00:46:09,900 --> 00:46:11,925
No. Let's go
Yes

538
00:46:41,632 --> 00:46:42,428
Master

539
00:46:44,868 --> 00:46:45,698
General

540
00:47:17,868 --> 00:47:19,460
Thank you, Sir

541
00:47:27,144 --> 00:47:28,873
Okay, good show Okay, good show

542
00:47:29,112 --> 00:47:30,204
Knock them down

543
00:47:35,352 --> 00:47:38,116
Let me go there and have a go

544
00:47:39,990 --> 00:47:43,357
They are not your match, General Sanpo

545
00:47:44,294 --> 00:47:47,730
Just treat it as to let them know
our Japanese martial arts

546
00:47:48,832 --> 00:47:54,771
Find 3 guys to fight with me

547
00:47:55,005 --> 00:47:56,563
Even if they lost,
they would still get a bag of rice

548
00:47:56,974 --> 00:47:57,770
Yes

549
00:48:00,978 --> 00:48:02,070
Don't say I didn't help you guys

550
00:48:02,813 --> 00:48:05,839
I've arranged with General Sanpo
to fight with the 3 of you

551
00:48:06,984 --> 00:48:10,317
No matter win or lose,
you'll still get a bag of rice

552
00:48:10,454 --> 00:48:12,649
It's okay if there is no rice.
Most important thing is, is to beat them up
