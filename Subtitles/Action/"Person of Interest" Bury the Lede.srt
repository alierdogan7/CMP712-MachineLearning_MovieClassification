1
00:00:03,503 --> 00:00:04,800
<i>You are being watched.</i>

2
00:00:06,172 --> 00:00:08,231
<i>The government has a secret system.</i>

3
00:00:08,408 --> 00:00:12,674
<i>A machine that spies on you
every hour of every day.</i>

4
00:00:12,846 --> 00:00:16,873
<i>I designed the machine to detect
acts of terror, but it sees everything.</i>

5
00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:20,247
<i>Violent crimes involving
ordinary people.</i>

6
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:23,253
<i>The government
considers these people irrelevant.</i>

7
00:00:23,423 --> 00:00:25,254
<i>We don't.</i>

8
00:00:25,558 --> 00:00:29,858
<i>Hunted by the authorities,
we work in secret.</i>

9
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:31,691
<i>You will never find us.</i>

10
00:00:31,865 --> 00:00:37,462
<i>But victim or perpetrator,
if your number's up, we'll find you.</i>

11
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:44,003
<i>The mayor's office
is up for grabs and Councilman Ed Griffin...</i>

12
00:00:44,177 --> 00:00:45,542
<i>... threw his hat in the ring today.</i>

13
00:00:45,712 --> 00:00:48,510
<i>A new candidate
in the race, Assistant DA Landon Walker.</i>

14
00:00:48,681 --> 00:00:51,650
<i>This is a bloodbath.
Griffin and Walker are neck and neck.</i>

15
00:00:51,818 --> 00:00:55,310
<i>Yeah, I hear that's
about to change. That reporter, Maxine Angelis...</i>

16
00:00:55,488 --> 00:00:59,049
<i>... she says one of Griffin's money men
has been cooking the books.</i>

17
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:06,194
<i>Who are you?
I'm the person not telling your wife...</i>

18
00:01:06,366 --> 00:01:08,391
<i>... that you're in a hotel room
waiting for a hooker.</i>

19
00:01:09,803 --> 00:01:14,206
Your office wasn't returning my calls,
so I thought I'd reach out to you personally.

20
00:01:14,774 --> 00:01:17,072
<i>Maxine Angelis, New York Journal.</i>

21
00:01:18,411 --> 00:01:21,175
This little game cuts both ways.

22
00:01:21,347 --> 00:01:25,408
What will your readers think when they
find out you get stories using blackmail?

23
00:01:25,585 --> 00:01:27,815
They'll think I'm good at my job.

24
00:01:27,987 --> 00:01:30,581
In the next five days,
New York elects a new mayor...

25
00:01:30,757 --> 00:01:34,022
...and I'm very curious
about the illegal fundraising you've done...

26
00:01:34,227 --> 00:01:35,626
...for Ed Griffin's campaign.

27
00:01:35,795 --> 00:01:37,160
Give me straight answers...

28
00:01:37,330 --> 00:01:41,232
...and I'll be kind enough to omit
the circumstances of our interview.

29
00:01:43,937 --> 00:01:45,700
<i>What is it you wanna know?</i>

30
00:01:45,872 --> 00:01:48,340
<i>You've raised over $100,000 for Griffin.</i>

31
00:01:48,508 --> 00:01:50,840
I can see why Maxine
keeps making headlines.

32
00:01:51,010 --> 00:01:55,174
Investigative journalists like Ms. Angelis
are an endangered species.

33
00:01:55,381 --> 00:01:59,340
In order to keep up with bloggers
and social media...

34
00:01:59,552 --> 00:02:03,181
...dedicated reporters have to be
increasingly creative to get the truth.

35
00:02:04,691 --> 00:02:07,182
Finch? Is that feedback?

36
00:02:07,393 --> 00:02:12,296
No, I simply made the grievous error
of buying Bear a squeaky toy.

37
00:02:15,502 --> 00:02:18,198
<i>In the six years
she's worked at the Journal...</i>

38
00:02:18,404 --> 00:02:22,500
...she's penned exposés on New York's
most dangerous criminals.

39
00:02:23,476 --> 00:02:25,910
The Cartel, Elias, HR.

40
00:02:26,079 --> 00:02:28,775
She's made some very powerful enemies.

41
00:02:29,482 --> 00:02:32,474
Odds are one of Maxine's stories
is about to get her killed.

42
00:02:33,019 --> 00:02:35,579
<i>Okay, I got what I need.</i>

43
00:02:35,822 --> 00:02:40,816
Thank you for your time, Mr. Hicks.
Oh, and tell your wife I said hi.

44
00:02:43,897 --> 00:02:47,333
Max, remember how you thought
HR had a lot more dirty cops out there?

45
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:50,958
You were right. The feds are indicting
dozens of NYPD officers.

46
00:02:51,137 --> 00:02:52,365
On my way.

47
00:02:56,509 --> 00:02:58,704
<i>FBI, you're under arrest.</i>

48
00:03:01,114 --> 00:03:03,810
<i>You two, out of the car.</i>

49
00:03:04,751 --> 00:03:07,185
<i>You have the right to remain silent.</i>

50
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:13,023
They're making the bust,
but I know this was you.

51
00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:16,128
- Nice work, detective.
- Keep your voice down, huh, Carter?

52
00:03:16,362 --> 00:03:19,820
You think John put me under with HR
because of my spotless record?

53
00:03:20,233 --> 00:03:23,896
- I'm glad the feds haven't come after me yet.
- The day's still young, Fusco.

54
00:03:25,838 --> 00:03:27,772
Agent Donnelly. Big day for you.

55
00:03:27,941 --> 00:03:32,207
Thanks, Carter. And don't think
I've forgotten about your man in a suit.

56
00:03:32,378 --> 00:03:34,846
We will catch him,
as soon as we're done with this.

57
00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:36,709
Looks pretty done to me.

58
00:03:36,883 --> 00:03:42,344
Over 75 dirty cops in bracelets.
So why aren't you smiling?

59
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:43,981
Oh.

60
00:03:44,157 --> 00:03:47,149
You don't have the big boss, do you?
Head of HR.

61
00:03:48,795 --> 00:03:52,754
- So got a particular cop in mind?
- I'm not so sure it is a cop.

62
00:03:52,932 --> 00:03:57,266
If a lead I'm working pans out,
soon I'll know exactly who is running things.

63
00:04:00,173 --> 00:04:01,299
Hey, Carter.

64
00:04:01,507 --> 00:04:04,237
My two cents? Let this one go, okay?

65
00:04:05,011 --> 00:04:08,674
Every crook HR screwed over,
every cartel they were in bed with...

66
00:04:08,881 --> 00:04:11,111
...they're all gonna want the big boss dead.

67
00:04:11,284 --> 00:04:15,584
Whoever catches that guy
better be bulletproof.

68
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:20,954
Is it weird that that just makes me
wanna catch him more?

69
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:22,752
For you? No.

70
00:04:25,898 --> 00:04:28,799
Hey, kiddo, it's Dad.
Remember, I'm picking you up today.

71
00:04:28,968 --> 00:04:32,495
So don't take the bus. And think about
what movie you wanna watch tonight.

72
00:04:32,672 --> 00:04:34,537
All right, I'll call you later.

73
00:04:42,181 --> 00:04:45,116
- Hello, Lionel.
- Look, Simmons...

74
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:48,015
Spare me whatever steaming pile
you're about to serve up.

75
00:04:48,221 --> 00:04:50,212
I saw you.

76
00:04:50,423 --> 00:04:54,519
The day the FBI got into HR,
I saw you helping that guy in the suit.

77
00:04:55,461 --> 00:04:58,123
You know, it even crossed my mind...

78
00:04:58,298 --> 00:05:00,960
...you might be the rat who tried
to take us down.

79
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:04,035
But you wouldn't be that stupid,
now, would you, Lionel?

80
00:05:05,438 --> 00:05:07,838
- No.
- Good.

81
00:05:08,007 --> 00:05:12,000
Because HR might be down,
but we are not out.

82
00:05:12,211 --> 00:05:16,375
My boss is pulling strings right now
to save the upper management.

83
00:05:16,582 --> 00:05:18,243
What do you need me for?

84
00:05:18,451 --> 00:05:21,352
Because the FBI keeps digging.

85
00:05:21,521 --> 00:05:25,252
We got word that they're on to something
that could still bring us all down.

86
00:05:25,458 --> 00:05:29,724
Me, my boss, probably even you.

87
00:05:29,962 --> 00:05:31,589
What do they got?

88
00:05:32,498 --> 00:05:36,559
Why don't you tell me?
Your partner's all buddy-buddy with Donnelly.

89
00:05:36,769 --> 00:05:39,237
You're gonna find out
what they're looking for...

90
00:05:39,405 --> 00:05:41,270
...and you're gonna make it disappear.

91
00:05:41,507 --> 00:05:43,372
And if I don't?

92
00:05:44,477 --> 00:05:47,002
Well, I guess I'll see you in prison.

93
00:05:48,114 --> 00:05:52,073
I mean, what's your kid gonna think
when he finds out what you did?

94
00:05:52,251 --> 00:05:54,776
You think your ex-wife's
gonna let you see him again?

95
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:57,956
I mean, you need this to go away
as bad as we do.

96
00:05:58,124 --> 00:06:00,615
Push comes to shove,
who's got your back here?

97
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:03,385
That goody-two-shoes partner of yours
or me?

98
00:06:04,764 --> 00:06:07,790
Just do this one thing for us, Lionel.

99
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,629
Then if you want out, you're out.

100
00:06:35,128 --> 00:06:38,757
So, Quinn, what brings you out
of campaign HQ?

101
00:06:38,931 --> 00:06:40,558
My boss' screaming, mostly.

102
00:06:40,733 --> 00:06:42,826
You've made this a very tough day for me.

103
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:46,732
Well, when you sign on as campaign
manager for a crook like Ed Griffin...

104
00:06:46,906 --> 00:06:49,466
...you gotta expect a few tough days.

105
00:06:49,642 --> 00:06:51,439
- Sorry.
- I'll survive.

106
00:06:51,611 --> 00:06:55,479
Politicians come and go,
but you and I are here forever, right Max?

107
00:06:56,549 --> 00:06:59,313
Off the record, it's not Griffin's year.

108
00:06:59,552 --> 00:07:02,043
Walker's ahead, and I can't find any dirt.

109
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:06,123
The cleaner they are on the outside,
the more rotten they are.

110
00:07:06,325 --> 00:07:08,293
I actually came by just to warn you.

111
00:07:09,562 --> 00:07:11,792
Griffin wants your head on a pike.

112
00:07:12,331 --> 00:07:15,357
Well, tell him to get in line.

113
00:07:18,104 --> 00:07:20,766
- You hear that, Finch?
- Edward Griffin.

114
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:23,602
Our newest suspect, but likely not our last.

115
00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:26,578
Oh, Bear, please.

116
00:07:28,481 --> 00:07:29,880
Look, here's your ball.

117
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:38,314
I should have access to Maxine's
cloud storage site shortly.

118
00:07:38,491 --> 00:07:41,892
Once I get inside, I'll scan through
everything she's working on...

119
00:07:42,094 --> 00:07:44,619
...see who else might want her dead.

120
00:07:46,165 --> 00:07:48,998
- That's not the real story, Glen.
- The hell it's not.

121
00:07:49,202 --> 00:07:51,727
Seventy-five cops in cuffs. That's news.

122
00:07:51,971 --> 00:07:54,667
<i>The story's not who they busted,
it's who they didn't.</i>

123
00:07:54,874 --> 00:07:59,243
The head of HR.
The FBI knows they don't have the big boss.

124
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:02,209
They're scooping up everybody
hoping they'll catch him...

125
00:08:02,381 --> 00:08:06,340
...if they cast a wide enough net.
- You wanna write about the big boss? Fine.

126
00:08:06,519 --> 00:08:10,387
Get me a name and something to back it up.
Until then, there's nothing to print.

127
00:08:10,556 --> 00:08:14,652
So she's looking for the head of HR.
Should we be looking at Simmons?

128
00:08:14,827 --> 00:08:18,058
Actually, my analysis of the evidence
from Detective Fusco...

129
00:08:18,231 --> 00:08:21,723
...suggests that Simmons is just
a high-ranking lieutenant.

130
00:08:21,934 --> 00:08:23,765
Then who's really in charge?

131
00:08:29,575 --> 00:08:32,738
Someone's dialing Maxine's cell.
Number blocked, no ID.

132
00:08:32,945 --> 00:08:35,573
<i>Maxine Angelis.
I can't tell you my name.</i>

133
00:08:35,748 --> 00:08:38,410
<i>- But I have information you want.
- Okay. What is that exactly?</i>

134
00:08:38,651 --> 00:08:41,245
<i>HR's big boss. I know who it is.</i>

135
00:08:41,420 --> 00:08:45,686
<i>- All right, I'm listening.
- The head of HR is Christopher Zambrano.</i>

136
00:08:45,858 --> 00:08:48,884
<i>- They're arresting him tonight.
- Who is this?</i>

137
00:08:49,061 --> 00:08:50,926
<i>A friend.</i>

138
00:08:54,433 --> 00:08:57,061
Christopher Zambrano.
Son of the late Mafia don.

139
00:08:57,236 --> 00:08:59,602
Whom I'm sure you will remember.

140
00:08:59,772 --> 00:09:03,105
But unlike his father, Christopher seems
to have kept his nose clean.

141
00:09:03,276 --> 00:09:06,473
Which would make him a good liaison
between the mob and the police.

142
00:09:06,712 --> 00:09:09,146
He owns an import-export business.

143
00:09:09,315 --> 00:09:14,446
Perfect cover for the smuggling operations
that have lined HR's pockets.

144
00:09:14,687 --> 00:09:16,917
<i>She's calling one of her contacts in the FBI.</i>

145
00:09:17,123 --> 00:09:20,581
Agent Clark.
Willis. Maxine Angelis.

146
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:24,719
Remember when you led that meth-lab raid
and busted into the wrong house...

147
00:09:24,931 --> 00:09:29,334
...and I left your name out of the paper and
you said you didn't know how to thank me?

148
00:09:29,502 --> 00:09:30,969
Well, I just thought of a way.

149
00:09:31,203 --> 00:09:32,727
What do you want, Maxine?

150
00:09:32,905 --> 00:09:35,965
What do you know about
the HR investigation? I just got a tip...

151
00:09:36,142 --> 00:09:39,407
...that Christopher Zambrano
is the boss of the whole operation.

152
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:42,645
Okay. This is deep, deep background.

153
00:09:42,815 --> 00:09:44,146
<i>But, uh...</i>

154
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:47,114
<i>Yes, I know they're looking at him
in connection with HR.</i>

155
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:49,584
When Donnelly was working
on the indictments...

156
00:09:49,755 --> 00:09:51,916
...I heard him talking about Zambrano
a lot.

157
00:09:52,091 --> 00:09:56,323
Okay. Well, thanks, Willis.
I'll keep your name out of this story too.

158
00:09:57,763 --> 00:10:01,529
Sounds like she's on to something.
We definitely need to check out Zambrano.

159
00:10:01,767 --> 00:10:05,134
I think Maxine might beat me to it.

160
00:10:10,776 --> 00:10:11,868
Mr. Zambrano.

161
00:10:12,111 --> 00:10:17,743
<i>- Maxine Angelis, New York Journal.
- Nice to meet you. Get off my property.</i>

162
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:21,010
<i>Why? Do you have
something to hide from a reporter?</i>

163
00:10:21,253 --> 00:10:24,120
<i>- Got eyes and ears on Zambrano, Finch.
Search all you want.</i>

164
00:10:24,323 --> 00:10:28,316
All you're gonna find is imported furniture,
a kiddie carousel, which I bought.

165
00:10:28,527 --> 00:10:31,690
For charity.
Does that make it into the papers? No.

166
00:10:31,897 --> 00:10:35,264
Because my last name is Zambrano,
you guys all think I'm a wiseguy.

167
00:10:36,469 --> 00:10:39,199
No, I think you're the head of HR.

168
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:42,501
What are you talking about?
Who told you that?

169
00:10:42,708 --> 00:10:45,302
I think you know
exactly what I'm talking about.

170
00:10:45,478 --> 00:10:49,812
Did you get a visit recently
from Agent Donnelly?

171
00:10:52,985 --> 00:10:54,577
- Never seen him before.
- Funny.

172
00:10:54,787 --> 00:10:59,053
Because the guard at the gate
has seen him here. Arguing with you.

173
00:10:59,225 --> 00:11:02,251
The son of a Mafia don,
owner of an import-export business...

174
00:11:02,428 --> 00:11:05,488
...getting grilled by the FBI agent
hunting HR.

175
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:07,997
If you're not involved,
how would you explain...?

176
00:11:08,167 --> 00:11:11,603
Shut your mouth.
I don't know anything about that, okay?

177
00:11:11,804 --> 00:11:14,602
If you keep asking questions,
somebody's gonna get hurt.

178
00:11:14,807 --> 00:11:17,435
<i>- I don't like this. I'm going in.
Reese, you can't.</i>

179
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:21,010
Maxine has another pet story.
She's been scouring through records...

180
00:11:21,213 --> 00:11:25,877
...talking to witnesses,
hunting for a man in a suit. Meaning you.

181
00:11:26,085 --> 00:11:29,782
We're fugitives getting illegal information
from a secret government machine.

182
00:11:29,955 --> 00:11:31,946
The last thing we need is publicity.

183
00:11:32,191 --> 00:11:35,024
<i>You must protect Miss Angelis,
but you have to do it...</i>

184
00:11:35,227 --> 00:11:38,560
<i>... without giving her any more proof
that the man in the suit exists.</i>

185
00:11:38,764 --> 00:11:41,927
<i>You expect me to believe
you're gonna hurt me at your business...</i>

186
00:11:42,134 --> 00:11:43,965
- Mr. Zambrano...
- You don't write that!

187
00:11:44,203 --> 00:11:47,832
Suspected HR boss assaults reporter.

188
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:50,873
Do you think that headline
makes you look less guilty?

189
00:11:53,746 --> 00:11:57,614
Hey, Teddy,
escort this bitch off my property.

190
00:11:59,351 --> 00:12:02,650
Okay, Finch,
how am I supposed to save a woman...

191
00:12:02,855 --> 00:12:05,415
...who wants to put me on the front page?

192
00:12:16,302 --> 00:12:20,398
Despite this complication,
we must focus on keeping Maxine safe.

193
00:12:20,606 --> 00:12:23,097
I can't find anything
in Zambrano's digital file...

194
00:12:23,309 --> 00:12:25,106
...to suggest he's the head of HR.

195
00:12:25,277 --> 00:12:29,304
But brilliant criminals have fooled us before.
I do wish you wouldn't do that here.

196
00:12:29,515 --> 00:12:32,109
When I do it in the park,
people look at me funny.

197
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:35,019
Okay, let's assume Zambrano
is the head of HR.

198
00:12:35,254 --> 00:12:39,623
He might want to have Maxine killed
before she can reveal his true identity.

199
00:12:39,825 --> 00:12:43,317
It'll be damn hard to stop him
if I can't let Maxine see me work.

200
00:12:43,529 --> 00:12:46,157
And when you step out of the shadows
to help her out...

201
00:12:46,398 --> 00:12:48,423
...she'll know you're the man in the suit.

202
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:51,434
Until we can figure out a way
to hide you in plain sight...

203
00:12:51,637 --> 00:12:53,901
...perhaps you should enlist some backup.

204
00:12:57,309 --> 00:13:00,506
Maxine Angelis, yeah, I've heard of her.

205
00:13:00,746 --> 00:13:04,204
That woman leaves no stone unturned.
How you expect to work with her around?

206
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:07,214
Aren't you and your friend
staying out of the papers?

207
00:13:07,453 --> 00:13:08,681
I'll keep my distance.

208
00:13:08,854 --> 00:13:11,516
The other photo I sent you
is Chris Zambrano.

209
00:13:11,757 --> 00:13:13,816
Maxine thinks he's HR's big boss.

210
00:13:14,026 --> 00:13:16,688
So he's crooked like his dad, huh?

211
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:24,169
- Everything okay, Fusco?
- Yeah, just something I ate, probably.

212
00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:27,430
Yeah, well, you don't become
head of HR by being sloppy.

213
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:31,303
If Zambrano wants your reporter dead
he'll do it in a way that's invisible.

214
00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:33,239
With no strings leading back to him.

215
00:13:33,445 --> 00:13:36,471
Fusco, when's the last time
you saw your pal Simmons?

216
00:13:37,316 --> 00:13:39,750
Haven't talked since I shot at him
covering your ass.

217
00:13:39,985 --> 00:13:42,749
Find him. Tail him.

218
00:13:42,988 --> 00:13:46,685
And if he gives you any trouble,
I've got your back.

219
00:13:47,259 --> 00:13:51,628
I'll talk to Donnelly, see who else is
on HR's payroll that hasn't been arrested yet.

220
00:13:51,864 --> 00:13:55,960
And if your reporter friend gets into trouble
before we find the shooter?

221
00:13:56,202 --> 00:13:57,965
Guess I'll have to call the police.

222
00:14:07,313 --> 00:14:09,247
<i>Though I'm unaware of any wrongdoing...</i>

223
00:14:09,415 --> 00:14:11,883
<i>... the funds will be donated to charity.</i>

224
00:14:12,084 --> 00:14:15,576
<i>Ed Griffin issuing a statement
about allegations in the New York Journal.</i>

225
00:14:15,788 --> 00:14:18,120
<i>Landon Walker is in our studio,
your response?</i>

226
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:20,757
<i>Bob, hiding the evidence
doesn't erase the crime.</i>

227
00:14:20,993 --> 00:14:23,985
<i>- This is what my opponent doesn't get.
- Look what you started.</i>

228
00:14:24,163 --> 00:14:27,326
<i>If I'm elected, I'll bring honesty
and integrity back to the city.</i>

229
00:14:29,401 --> 00:14:33,303
I got him, Glen, the head of HR.
Christopher Zambrano.

230
00:14:36,775 --> 00:14:39,209
<i>The Mafia don's kid? Based on what?</i>

231
00:14:39,411 --> 00:14:42,312
Four sources:
Anonymous tip, guard at the docks...

232
00:14:42,514 --> 00:14:45,972
...an FBI agent familiar with the case,
and Zambrano himself.

233
00:14:46,652 --> 00:14:50,053
- He admitted it to you?
- He wasn't yelling because he's innocent.

234
00:14:50,256 --> 00:14:52,918
I hear Donnelly's already filed the indictment.

235
00:14:53,926 --> 00:14:58,761
We'll run it on the website
and back-edit it once the feds pick him up.

236
00:15:16,782 --> 00:15:18,773
Well, the cat's out of the bag.

237
00:15:18,984 --> 00:15:21,179
But Ms. Angelis is not out of danger yet.

238
00:15:21,453 --> 00:15:24,320
<i>Zambrano may order her execution
for simple revenge.</i>

239
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:26,421
<i>She's not safe until he's behind bars.</i>

240
00:15:26,625 --> 00:15:28,923
Finch, I can't protect her like this.

241
00:15:29,128 --> 00:15:31,619
- I've got to get close to her.
- Oh, you're about to.

242
00:15:32,164 --> 00:15:36,260
It seems Maxine's job doesn't afford her
opportunities to meet nice men...

243
00:15:36,468 --> 00:15:40,700
...so she somewhat reluctantly signed up
with a popular online dating site.

244
00:15:40,973 --> 00:15:44,374
I took the liberty of back-engineering
the matching algorithm...

245
00:15:44,576 --> 00:15:48,808
...to create the profile of her ideal man.
She really likes that you love dogs.

246
00:15:49,648 --> 00:15:52,481
Wait, you're trying to get me
a date with her?

247
00:15:52,685 --> 00:15:56,314
Already have. Tonight at 8.
You've been flirting all day.

248
00:15:58,724 --> 00:16:02,091
Finch, what did I just say to her?

249
00:16:12,338 --> 00:16:16,069
<i>New cuff links I could understand,
but buying a $100,000 sports car...</i>

250
00:16:16,241 --> 00:16:19,608
<i>...was that really necessary?
- Relax, Finch, the car's stolen.</i>

251
00:16:20,245 --> 00:16:21,542
Nice car.

252
00:16:22,181 --> 00:16:25,241
Let's hope you're not
compensating for something.

253
00:16:26,185 --> 00:16:28,380
<i>Remember, your name is John Anderson.</i>

254
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:31,020
VP at Jensen Actuarial.

255
00:16:31,223 --> 00:16:34,556
<i>You like walking your dog,
kayaking and Hitchcock movies.</i>

256
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:36,990
And Maxine's fondness for intellectuals...

257
00:16:37,162 --> 00:16:40,222
...presents us with a graceful way
to cover up your identity.

258
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:42,892
Are you wearing those glasses I got you?

259
00:16:43,535 --> 00:16:46,265
Sure.

260
00:16:46,939 --> 00:16:48,065
I, uh...

261
00:16:49,241 --> 00:16:53,041
I called ahead and ordered us a bottle.
I hope you like champagne.

262
00:16:53,212 --> 00:16:56,943
I don't. Don't you remember
joking about this online?

263
00:16:58,550 --> 00:17:02,316
- Sorry, can I get a Boulevardier?
- Did you not review the notes I sent you?

264
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:04,584
So, John...

265
00:17:05,090 --> 00:17:08,958
...I've always wondered,
what does an actuarial actually do?

266
00:17:10,429 --> 00:17:13,455
Most days, just try to stay awake.

267
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:16,099
Mr. Reese, wrong answer.

268
00:17:16,568 --> 00:17:20,868
Maxine is passionate about her career
and wants a partner who feels the same.

269
00:17:21,073 --> 00:17:23,200
Okay, time for reinforcements.

270
00:17:24,243 --> 00:17:26,040
John?

271
00:17:26,712 --> 00:17:27,974
How are you?

272
00:17:28,213 --> 00:17:29,510
Zoe. Heh.

273
00:17:29,748 --> 00:17:31,716
You trying to make me jealous?

274
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:33,518
Finch have you on standby?

275
00:17:33,752 --> 00:17:36,880
Social psychology.
Women are more attracted to men...

276
00:17:37,089 --> 00:17:39,751
...who receive the approval
of other attractive women.

277
00:17:39,925 --> 00:17:43,053
Maxine, this is Zoe.

278
00:17:43,228 --> 00:17:46,664
- She's a friend.
- So how do you two know each other?

279
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:48,457
Oh, we spent...

280
00:17:48,634 --> 00:17:50,761
...two very long nights together last year.

281
00:17:52,938 --> 00:17:55,634
It was great seeing you again, John.

282
00:18:01,113 --> 00:18:03,377
You dated Zoe Morgan?

283
00:18:04,149 --> 00:18:07,676
There's not a reporter in town
who wouldn't kill to interview that woman.

284
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:11,185
Science. The tenets of social psychology
are firmly rooted in an understanding...

285
00:18:12,558 --> 00:18:13,786
So tell me about your job.

286
00:18:14,359 --> 00:18:16,953
What's the most exciting story
you're working on now?

287
00:18:17,162 --> 00:18:18,857
You'll just think I'm weird.

288
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:25,664
Okay, well, there's a rumor about this guy...

289
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:28,801
...the police just call him
"the man in the suit."

290
00:18:29,274 --> 00:18:30,571
No one's seen his face...

291
00:18:30,776 --> 00:18:33,609
...no one knows his name,
I'm not even sure he exists.

292
00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:35,940
But he's like something out of a comic book.

293
00:18:36,148 --> 00:18:38,639
When people are in trouble
he comes out of nowhere.

294
00:18:38,851 --> 00:18:41,012
He always seems to be there just in time...

295
00:18:41,253 --> 00:18:43,847
...and, whoever he is, he saves a lot of lives.

296
00:18:44,156 --> 00:18:46,818
And he shoots a lot of kneecaps.

297
00:18:47,025 --> 00:18:49,255
Sounds like a great guy.

298
00:18:49,528 --> 00:18:52,964
- And an urban legend.
- Maybe, but if he's real...

299
00:18:53,265 --> 00:18:55,563
...I'm going to put that man on the cover...

300
00:18:55,767 --> 00:18:58,258
...of every magazine
and newspaper in this country.

301
00:18:59,471 --> 00:19:00,495
Uh...

302
00:19:00,672 --> 00:19:03,072
What about Christopher Zambrano?

303
00:19:03,308 --> 00:19:04,775
I read your website.

304
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:08,879
Ever worry that writing about a man
like that might put you in harm's way?

305
00:19:09,081 --> 00:19:10,548
Occupational hazard.

306
00:19:11,183 --> 00:19:13,845
Still couldn't hurt
to skip town for the weekend.

307
00:19:14,052 --> 00:19:17,852
- Let this blow over.
- Thanks for your concern, John.

308
00:19:18,223 --> 00:19:21,750
And for that very slick offer
to whisk me away.

309
00:19:22,561 --> 00:19:24,552
But this is what I do.

310
00:19:25,230 --> 00:19:27,926
I find out what people need to know...

311
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:30,795
...what those in power
don't want them to know...

312
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:34,097
...and I make sure everyone hears about it.

313
00:19:34,907 --> 00:19:37,432
To me that's worth a little risk.

314
00:19:38,443 --> 00:19:43,847
In times of universal deceit,
telling the truth is a revolutionary act.

315
00:19:44,116 --> 00:19:45,481
George Orwell.

316
00:19:46,852 --> 00:19:49,582
Oh, I'm sorry, I have to take this. Sorry.

317
00:19:51,089 --> 00:19:53,853
Glen. Okay... Glen, Glen, Glen, slow down.

318
00:19:54,059 --> 00:19:56,289
<i>- Kind of busy, Carter.
We have a problem.</i>

319
00:19:56,528 --> 00:19:59,019
I just got off the phone with Donnelly...

320
00:19:59,231 --> 00:20:04,464
...and Maxine's story about Zambrano
being the big boss of HR, it's not true.

321
00:20:04,703 --> 00:20:07,638
Oh, my God... Okay. Oh, my God.

322
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:11,107
- Zambrano's not the boss?
- He isn't even a suspect.

323
00:20:11,276 --> 00:20:14,211
Then she wrote that thing
and put a bull's-eye on his chest.

324
00:20:14,413 --> 00:20:18,747
Every crook, HR screw, every cartel
they work with, everyone wants him dead.

325
00:20:18,951 --> 00:20:21,579
Maxine's not in danger, Zambrano is.

326
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:23,946
We need to find him before it's too late.

327
00:20:24,156 --> 00:20:27,614
<i>You were wrong, Max.
The FBI's on their way, they wanna talk to you.</i>

328
00:20:27,859 --> 00:20:31,295
Okay, forget about me.
Where is Zambrano, and is he okay?

329
00:20:31,496 --> 00:20:33,657
<i>He's not answering.
No one knows where he is.</i>

330
00:20:33,899 --> 00:20:35,594
Work emergency, I'll call you.

331
00:20:35,801 --> 00:20:38,736
I don't know what your emergency is,
but I bet mine's worse.

332
00:20:38,937 --> 00:20:43,306
I just put Zambrano's life in danger,
so I need you to give me a ride.

333
00:20:49,081 --> 00:20:50,639
Okay. Wait in the car.

334
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:56,119
<i>You're close, Mr. Reese.
Zambrano is 300 meters west-north-west of you.</i>

335
00:20:58,090 --> 00:21:00,786
Guess the FBI doesn't have him bluejacked.

336
00:21:01,193 --> 00:21:03,388
Mr. Zambrano!

337
00:21:04,463 --> 00:21:06,954
Mr. Zambrano?

338
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:09,394
Chris!

339
00:21:24,316 --> 00:21:25,442
Where's Zambrano?

340
00:21:26,818 --> 00:21:28,615
Help!

341
00:21:31,556 --> 00:21:33,023
Finch.

342
00:21:35,727 --> 00:21:37,217
We didn't get here in time.

343
00:21:53,111 --> 00:21:57,571
Okay, Miss Angelis and Mr. Anderson,
was it?

344
00:21:57,749 --> 00:21:59,273
Uh, you can call me John.

345
00:22:00,385 --> 00:22:02,012
I just need to get a statement.

346
00:22:02,187 --> 00:22:03,984
You found Mr. Zambrano, right?

347
00:22:04,823 --> 00:22:07,621
He was shot. He wasn't breathing.

348
00:22:09,928 --> 00:22:11,418
It was all my fault.

349
00:22:11,596 --> 00:22:14,326
I'm sorry. Can l...? I just need a minute.

350
00:22:14,499 --> 00:22:16,194
Yeah, sure.

351
00:22:18,136 --> 00:22:21,333
You're dating her?
That's how you're keeping your distance?

352
00:22:21,506 --> 00:22:23,167
It's, um, complicated.

353
00:22:23,342 --> 00:22:27,335
Your killers are knocked out of the scene.
My guess is they're Toreros Cartel.

354
00:22:27,512 --> 00:22:30,310
One of the many organizations
that wanted HR's boss dead.

355
00:22:30,482 --> 00:22:33,451
Just got the wrong guy.

356
00:22:34,786 --> 00:22:39,280
Look, this isn't the best place for me to be
but I'm not leaving her.

357
00:22:40,225 --> 00:22:41,522
Can I get her out of here?

358
00:22:42,494 --> 00:22:44,291
Yeah.

359
00:22:46,798 --> 00:22:48,857
Come on. She said we could go.

360
00:22:49,668 --> 00:22:50,896
Some first date, huh?

361
00:22:51,703 --> 00:22:53,398
Maxine Angelis.

362
00:22:53,572 --> 00:22:55,540
Special Agent Donnelly, FBI.

363
00:22:55,941 --> 00:22:58,171
You're gonna answer some questions.

364
00:22:58,543 --> 00:23:01,535
The gate guard told me
that you'd been arguing with Zambrano.

365
00:23:01,713 --> 00:23:05,046
- And an agent I spoke to said...
- Agent Clark didn't know anything.

366
00:23:05,217 --> 00:23:09,586
But I am really not interested in hearing
you try to justify what you did.

367
00:23:09,755 --> 00:23:14,419
All I want is the person who first told you
that Chris Zambrano was the head of HR.

368
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:19,194
I got a call. It was an anonymous tip.

369
00:23:19,364 --> 00:23:22,197
It was a man. A blocked number.

370
00:23:26,538 --> 00:23:28,062
Eleven forty-one, that's it.

371
00:23:30,976 --> 00:23:34,673
But if he wasn't the boss,
then why were you even?

372
00:23:38,917 --> 00:23:44,014
Do you have any idea how colossally
you just screwed up?

373
00:23:45,791 --> 00:23:47,691
Zambrano wasn't HR's boss.

374
00:23:47,859 --> 00:23:50,623
He was the witness
that could bring the boss down.

375
00:23:50,796 --> 00:23:53,390
Zambrano's father
was the mob's point man with HR.

376
00:23:53,999 --> 00:23:56,763
And he kept records. A ledger.

377
00:23:56,935 --> 00:24:00,063
With names and dollar amounts
for everyone on HR's payroll...

378
00:24:00,238 --> 00:24:02,433
...including the boss.

379
00:24:02,607 --> 00:24:06,065
And when the don died,
Chris Zambrano found that ledger.

380
00:24:06,244 --> 00:24:12,114
But unlike his dad, Chris was a good man,
totally clean.

381
00:24:12,284 --> 00:24:15,378
When he realized what he was holding,
he called the FBI.

382
00:24:15,554 --> 00:24:18,887
- Why didn't you protect him?
- What do you think we were arguing about?

383
00:24:19,057 --> 00:24:20,820
I tried to convince him.

384
00:24:21,026 --> 00:24:23,494
But because of people
calling him a criminal...

385
00:24:23,662 --> 00:24:26,130
...Zambrano was afraid
we would think he was dirty.

386
00:24:26,665 --> 00:24:30,123
He'd only hand over the ledger
once he'd signed an immunity deal.

387
00:24:30,302 --> 00:24:33,100
And the paperwork came through tonight.

388
00:24:33,572 --> 00:24:40,478
And if you print one word of this,
I will lock your ass up for obstruction.

389
00:24:46,251 --> 00:24:50,950
Well, your tip came from a disposable cell.

390
00:24:51,289 --> 00:24:54,588
The first choice of criminals
and virtually impossible to trace.

391
00:24:54,759 --> 00:24:57,626
So congratulations, Miss Angelis,
you just got played.

392
00:24:57,796 --> 00:25:00,959
Probably by the real head of HR.

393
00:25:27,659 --> 00:25:31,151
So Maxine wasn't the victim,
she was the perpetrator.

394
00:25:31,329 --> 00:25:35,231
Unwitting, involuntary,
but a perpetrator all the same.

395
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:38,392
The boss wipes out the only witness
who could bring him down...

396
00:25:38,603 --> 00:25:42,630
...and destroys the career
of a troublesome reporter to boot.

397
00:25:42,807 --> 00:25:46,004
And we're gonna find out
who that bastard is and bring him down.

398
00:25:46,177 --> 00:25:48,543
And I'll search Zambrano's digital footprint...

399
00:25:48,713 --> 00:25:52,342
...see if I can find out where he hid
the ledger with the boss' name in it.

400
00:25:52,751 --> 00:25:56,118
And I'll see what our undercover can dig up.

401
00:25:58,023 --> 00:26:01,049
Fusco, you and Simmons need to have
a little talk.

402
00:26:01,226 --> 00:26:03,660
<i>See if he knows who the real head of HR is.</i>

403
00:26:03,828 --> 00:26:06,524
If Simmons knew that,
I would have brought down the boss.

404
00:26:06,698 --> 00:26:09,531
Well, ask anyway and let me know
if you find anything out.

405
00:26:09,701 --> 00:26:11,498
Will do, boss.

406
00:26:18,944 --> 00:26:21,504
All right, Zambrano,
where'd you hide that ledger?

407
00:26:30,956 --> 00:26:32,218
Maxine Angelis.

408
00:26:32,390 --> 00:26:34,290
Max? Quinn. How are you?

409
00:26:34,759 --> 00:26:36,784
<i>- Guess I was due for a tough day.
- Yeah.</i>

410
00:26:36,962 --> 00:26:40,864
We have to use this to discredit you.
Everything you wrote about Griffin.

411
00:26:41,032 --> 00:26:44,092
We're throwing you under the bus, Max.
I'm sorry.

412
00:26:44,536 --> 00:26:46,094
You're a true friend, Quinn.

413
00:26:53,578 --> 00:26:56,103
Glen. What can I do?

414
00:26:57,782 --> 00:27:00,979
I think we've got it handled.
We're moving the election off A1...

415
00:27:01,186 --> 00:27:03,552
...to make room for our retraction
on Zambrano.

416
00:27:03,722 --> 00:27:05,246
I can write the retraction.

417
00:27:05,423 --> 00:27:08,950
I'm afraid you won't be writing anything
until we sit down with Legal.

418
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:18,562
<i>Ms. Angelis'future
as a journalist may be in doubt...</i>

419
00:27:18,737 --> 00:27:21,205
...but she's not done investigating.

420
00:27:22,841 --> 00:27:24,809
She's calling that disposable cell.

421
00:27:25,276 --> 00:27:28,006
<i>You have reached a voicemail
box that has not been set up yet.</i>

422
00:27:29,381 --> 00:27:30,814
I don't know who you are...

423
00:27:30,982 --> 00:27:33,815
...but I know what you did,
I know where to find your name.

424
00:27:33,985 --> 00:27:37,785
<i>And when I do, I will put a picture of you,
in handcuffs...</i>

425
00:27:37,956 --> 00:27:40,356
...on the front page of this paper.

426
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:43,521
She's looking for that HR ledger.

427
00:27:43,728 --> 00:27:47,164
And I need to get her to stop
before she gets herself in trouble.

428
00:27:52,170 --> 00:27:55,105
<i>- Hello?
- Maxine. It's John.</i>

429
00:27:55,273 --> 00:27:58,299
I thought maybe you could use a drink.

430
00:28:00,845 --> 00:28:03,006
I was surprised to hear from you.

431
00:28:03,181 --> 00:28:07,311
There's generally no second date
when the first one ends in homicide, heh.

432
00:28:08,186 --> 00:28:12,282
Well, I was, um, thinking about you.

433
00:28:12,957 --> 00:28:14,822
Wanted to see if I could help.

434
00:28:16,194 --> 00:28:17,991
Well, now that you mention it...

435
00:28:18,163 --> 00:28:21,189
...I could use your accounting skills
to scope these records.

436
00:28:21,366 --> 00:28:25,530
Here's everything I've got on Zambrano.
We're looking for where Zambrano might...

437
00:28:25,704 --> 00:28:30,801
I think maybe we should just leave that
for the proper authorities.

438
00:28:36,347 --> 00:28:41,375
I put getting a scoop before getting the truth.

439
00:28:41,986 --> 00:28:44,477
And my arrogance cost a good man his life.

440
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:48,791
Now, I can't do anything to fix that...

441
00:28:49,394 --> 00:28:53,228
...but I sure as hell can catch the bastard
behind all of this.

442
00:28:54,432 --> 00:28:56,229
Thanks for the beer.

443
00:29:04,342 --> 00:29:06,902
Maxine. Maxine.

444
00:29:10,915 --> 00:29:15,045
I know how it feels
to do things you can never take back.

445
00:29:16,387 --> 00:29:20,016
And I can't stop you from hurting
or wanting to fix this.

446
00:29:22,227 --> 00:29:24,525
But I just don't want you to think
you're alone.

447
00:29:26,464 --> 00:29:28,261
Get down.

448
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:34,971
Finch, I think the boss got
Maxine's message.

449
00:29:43,882 --> 00:29:45,543
Give me your keys.

450
00:29:54,959 --> 00:29:56,517
Finch, we're heading to my place.

451
00:30:05,570 --> 00:30:07,834
Oh, shoot. I've got your dog.

452
00:30:38,603 --> 00:30:41,595
Bear's even cuter than his picture.

453
00:30:43,541 --> 00:30:46,271
And he really likes that closet, huh?

454
00:30:46,444 --> 00:30:49,277
His, uh, treats are in there.

455
00:30:49,447 --> 00:30:51,915
So that was interesting.

456
00:30:52,083 --> 00:30:54,278
Maybe we should call the cops.

457
00:30:54,452 --> 00:30:58,616
Which ones? If HR's boss is still out there,
I don't know who to trust.

458
00:30:58,790 --> 00:31:01,384
Any idea who was shooting at us?

459
00:31:01,559 --> 00:31:06,292
No, but if they're trying to kill me,
I must be doing something right.

460
00:31:08,099 --> 00:31:12,934
Wow. Guess your boring job pays all right.

461
00:31:13,638 --> 00:31:15,469
I'm calling in sick tomorrow.

462
00:31:17,141 --> 00:31:20,338
I won't leave your side until this is over.

463
00:31:22,247 --> 00:31:25,182
You're a good man, John Anderson.

464
00:31:30,421 --> 00:31:32,286
I'll sleep on the couch.

465
00:31:34,158 --> 00:31:36,649
Like I said, a good man.

466
00:31:39,931 --> 00:31:42,593
And if I want to take my contacts out?

467
00:31:42,767 --> 00:31:44,132
Oh, um...

468
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:47,128
That way.

469
00:32:00,184 --> 00:32:02,379
When were you ever going to need
all those?

470
00:32:02,587 --> 00:32:06,683
You shouldn't have brought her back here.
Even the best cover just goes so deep.

471
00:32:06,858 --> 00:32:09,349
The longer she stays,
the more questions she'll have.

472
00:32:09,527 --> 00:32:13,725
Imagine how many questions she'll have
if she comes out and sees you here.

473
00:32:13,898 --> 00:32:19,234
Get a look at the men shooting at you?
- I tried but they were shooting at me.

474
00:32:19,404 --> 00:32:22,805
I'll get in the pub's security system,
see what I can find.

475
00:32:27,111 --> 00:32:28,408
<i>I've got a lead, Mr. Reese.</i>

476
00:32:28,613 --> 00:32:31,207
<i>I got images of the shooters
from the pub security.</i>

477
00:32:31,382 --> 00:32:34,510
I found a photo-sharing site
that had a facial-recognition app...

478
00:32:34,686 --> 00:32:36,313
...shut down by a lawsuit.

479
00:32:36,487 --> 00:32:40,856
I hacked in, turned the app back on,
and identified our gunmen.

480
00:32:43,328 --> 00:32:47,731
- They're FBI.
- Ex-FBI. Agents Bogle and Pitt.

481
00:32:47,899 --> 00:32:49,867
<i>They took early retirement last year.</i>

482
00:32:50,034 --> 00:32:52,400
But if they've still got contacts
at the bureau...

483
00:32:52,570 --> 00:32:55,767
...I'd guess that they told HR's boss
about Zambrano's ledger.

484
00:32:55,940 --> 00:32:58,204
<i>Finch, I know you want me to keep my cover.</i>

485
00:32:58,376 --> 00:33:00,537
Maxine needs to know
what she's dealing with.

486
00:33:00,712 --> 00:33:02,771
And I need to be able to protect her.

487
00:33:02,981 --> 00:33:06,178
Calm down. I sent your girlfriend
a text with the same information.

488
00:33:06,351 --> 00:33:07,716
<i>Anonymously, of course.</i>

489
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:10,683
I need to talk to a friend of yours.

490
00:33:12,290 --> 00:33:13,780
Leonard Pitt and Craig Bogle.

491
00:33:13,992 --> 00:33:17,428
Forced out for harassment
and malicious prosecution.

492
00:33:17,595 --> 00:33:19,722
Word is that
they were in someone's pocket.

493
00:33:20,331 --> 00:33:23,198
They were using those badges
to do favors for their real boss.

494
00:33:23,368 --> 00:33:26,804
The man who got Zambrano killed
with one call from a disposable cell...

495
00:33:26,971 --> 00:33:28,939
...the head of HR, who is he?

496
00:33:29,273 --> 00:33:31,434
There are some secrets
that even I don't know.

497
00:33:32,043 --> 00:33:34,409
But you know who buys disposables
by the case?

498
00:33:34,579 --> 00:33:36,706
Criminals, sure.

499
00:33:36,881 --> 00:33:39,145
But also political campaigns.

500
00:33:39,317 --> 00:33:42,047
They're cheap, untraceable, anonymous.

501
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:44,950
And if they get caught pulling dirty tricks...

502
00:33:45,123 --> 00:33:46,420
...it can save their ass.

503
00:33:46,591 --> 00:33:48,616
<i>His attendance record is deplorable.</i>

504
00:33:48,793 --> 00:33:51,921
<i>Is this the kind of experience
we want running our city?</i>

505
00:33:52,630 --> 00:33:56,327
<i>Landon Walker is the responsible,
reliable choice for mayor.</i>

506
00:33:57,235 --> 00:34:02,434
Zambrano gets killed for knowing the name
of HR's boss five days before an election.

507
00:34:02,607 --> 00:34:05,440
Are you telling me
the boss is running for mayor?

508
00:34:05,610 --> 00:34:07,771
I'm rendering an opinion.

509
00:34:08,246 --> 00:34:10,806
Personally, I avoid politicians.

510
00:34:10,982 --> 00:34:13,177
They so rarely have any real power.

511
00:34:13,351 --> 00:34:16,718
You know, it was a pleasure meeting you
but it's a shame we never met.

512
00:34:18,489 --> 00:34:20,081
Be good, John.

513
00:34:30,268 --> 00:34:33,863
Yes. Okay, perfect. Thank you so much.

514
00:34:36,541 --> 00:34:39,032
One of Griffin's old opponents
just confirmed...

515
00:34:39,243 --> 00:34:42,007
...being harassed by Bogle and Pitt
during their campaign.

516
00:34:42,180 --> 00:34:45,616
If Griffin's hired them before,
they're probably still working for him.

517
00:34:45,783 --> 00:34:48,775
Do you have enough to unmask him
on the front page?

518
00:34:48,953 --> 00:34:51,513
I will never make that mistake again.

519
00:34:51,689 --> 00:34:54,556
I'm not going to press
until I have that ledger in my hands.

520
00:34:55,393 --> 00:34:59,295
We just need to find where Zambrano hid it.

521
00:35:05,169 --> 00:35:08,070
Pretty smooth conning me into a third date,
by the way.

522
00:35:08,272 --> 00:35:11,673
I like to think of it as a third attempt
at a first date.

523
00:35:18,649 --> 00:35:20,082
Wait.

524
00:35:20,284 --> 00:35:23,151
Wait. Zambrano said everybody thought
he was a wiseguy...

525
00:35:23,321 --> 00:35:26,347
...and nobody ever looked
at the good things he did.

526
00:35:27,091 --> 00:35:29,719
If he were looking for a place
to hide that ledger...

527
00:35:29,894 --> 00:35:34,058
...maybe he would put it where
he thought no one would go looking.

528
00:35:48,579 --> 00:35:51,605
Does that fancy car of yours
have a crowbar?

529
00:35:57,455 --> 00:36:00,390
Here. It's unlocked.

530
00:36:13,704 --> 00:36:17,037
Start with the horses.
They were still being delivered yesterday.

531
00:36:43,267 --> 00:36:45,064
Found something.

532
00:36:55,446 --> 00:36:57,676
Zambrano's ledger.

533
00:36:57,982 --> 00:36:59,609
Wanna find out who's running HR?

534
00:37:00,651 --> 00:37:01,982
Thanks, Maxine.

535
00:37:03,254 --> 00:37:05,950
Our boss has been looking all over for that.

536
00:37:17,201 --> 00:37:20,295
<i>I've called Detective Carter
and help is on the way, Mr. Reese.</i>

537
00:37:20,471 --> 00:37:24,999
You can't take action without Maxine
learning who you really are.

538
00:37:25,176 --> 00:37:27,406
If at all possible, wait for rescue.

539
00:37:27,612 --> 00:37:29,170
I'll try to keep that in mind.

540
00:37:31,048 --> 00:37:33,346
I gotta tell you, you've been a huge help.

541
00:37:33,517 --> 00:37:36,008
First Zambrano, then the ledger.

542
00:37:36,187 --> 00:37:38,417
<i>Now you're kind enough
to bring your boyfriend.</i>

543
00:37:38,623 --> 00:37:40,318
We're gonna dump you at your place.

544
00:37:40,491 --> 00:37:43,927
We'll make it look like a lovers' spat
turned murder-suicide.

545
00:37:44,128 --> 00:37:45,186
When I wind up dead...

546
00:37:45,363 --> 00:37:48,560
...think the police won't find your names
in my notes, Agent Bogle?

547
00:37:48,733 --> 00:37:51,395
Or is it Mr. Bogle now?

548
00:37:51,569 --> 00:37:54,163
And now you're doing a double homicide
to shut me up.

549
00:37:54,338 --> 00:37:57,171
But when you get caught,
will your boss even think twice...

550
00:37:57,341 --> 00:37:59,400
...before killing you to cover his tracks?

551
00:38:00,544 --> 00:38:03,877
Who is your boss, by the way?
Should we open that ledger and find out?

552
00:38:07,151 --> 00:38:08,618
Guess that's a "no comment."

553
00:38:11,155 --> 00:38:12,520
N.Y.P.D. Drop your weapon.

554
00:38:12,690 --> 00:38:14,851
FBI. We're here on official business.

555
00:38:15,059 --> 00:38:17,584
Miss Angelis is a witness
in a homicide investigation.

556
00:38:17,762 --> 00:38:19,195
Drop your guns.

557
00:38:19,363 --> 00:38:20,523
You hear sirens, Pitt?

558
00:38:21,866 --> 00:38:25,802
Two N.Y.P.D. Detectives just took a hot door
without calling for backup.

559
00:38:25,970 --> 00:38:29,235
So you're not here
on official business either.

560
00:38:50,094 --> 00:38:52,494
Where's Griffin? Where's Griffin?
Where's Griffin?

561
00:39:01,339 --> 00:39:02,465
Walker.

562
00:39:18,956 --> 00:39:20,082
Dispatch, I need a bus.

563
00:39:20,257 --> 00:39:23,784
Got a suspect in custody
with a GSW to the shoulder.

564
00:39:26,130 --> 00:39:29,293
- What did I miss?
- Nothing you can't read in tomorrow's paper.

565
00:39:29,734 --> 00:39:32,362
Excuse me, ma'am.
We're gonna need that as evidence.

566
00:39:32,536 --> 00:39:34,026
Thank you.

567
00:40:01,132 --> 00:40:04,124
We've got the fundraiser in midtown.
We have to get there by 3.

568
00:40:04,301 --> 00:40:06,792
Do you think we can do that? Yeah?
Let's go.

569
00:40:07,905 --> 00:40:08,963
Landon Walker.

570
00:40:09,173 --> 00:40:12,700
You're under arrest for receiving bribes,
enterprise corruption and conspiracy.

571
00:40:12,877 --> 00:40:14,811
- You have the right to remain silent.
- Whoa, whoa!

572
00:40:14,979 --> 00:40:18,312
Anything you say can and will be used
against you in a court of law.

573
00:40:32,563 --> 00:40:37,000
So you're off the hook.

574
00:40:37,168 --> 00:40:39,295
Your boss is locked up.

575
00:40:41,105 --> 00:40:42,265
Are we done here?

576
00:40:45,676 --> 00:40:49,612
Once you're in, you're never out.

577
00:40:49,814 --> 00:40:52,044
You want anything else from me...

578
00:40:53,384 --> 00:40:55,215
...never mention my kid again.

579
00:40:56,687 --> 00:40:59,520
I'm not a threat to your son, Lionel.

580
00:41:00,191 --> 00:41:01,886
You are.

581
00:41:13,938 --> 00:41:16,805
No bodies, no bullets.

582
00:41:16,974 --> 00:41:19,943
So this is what a normal date
with you is like.

583
00:41:20,110 --> 00:41:22,044
Nice, isn't it?

584
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:25,744
And I'm afraid it has to be our last.

585
00:41:28,052 --> 00:41:29,314
I like you, John.

586
00:41:30,855 --> 00:41:32,482
Quite a bit, actually.

587
00:41:33,924 --> 00:41:35,755
But I'm married to my work.

588
00:41:35,926 --> 00:41:40,829
And, honestly, I still think
you're a little hung up on Zoe Morgan.

589
00:41:54,011 --> 00:41:55,444
See you.

590
00:41:56,413 --> 00:41:58,813
So you're off to chase
your "man in a suit"?

591
00:42:00,618 --> 00:42:03,348
No, you were right. Urban legend.

592
00:42:04,021 --> 00:42:07,650
And with the week I just had,
if there really was a man like that...

593
00:42:07,825 --> 00:42:09,520
...I think I'd have met him by now.

594
00:42:14,765 --> 00:42:17,131
<i>Mr. Reese, this may not be over.</i>

595
00:42:17,301 --> 00:42:18,928
You're paranoid, Finch.

596
00:42:19,103 --> 00:42:21,628
Be that as it may...

597
00:42:23,340 --> 00:42:26,275
...I don't think we got the right guy.

598
00:42:26,443 --> 00:42:30,345
Walker was on HR's payroll.
He'd have motive to want Zambrano dead.

599
00:42:30,514 --> 00:42:33,847
Yes, yes, and he definitely hired
Pitt and Bogle to hunt down Maxine.

600
00:42:34,018 --> 00:42:35,451
But that's what troubles me.

601
00:42:35,619 --> 00:42:37,814
The head of HR is brilliant.

602
00:42:37,988 --> 00:42:40,980
Not the type to hire washed-up feds
to gun down a reporter.

603
00:42:41,158 --> 00:42:45,652
And Walker? I'm not convinced
he has the cunning or the connections...

604
00:42:45,829 --> 00:42:48,320
...to mastermind something
this complicated.

605
00:42:48,499 --> 00:42:54,165
All right. If Walker isn't the real head of HR,
who is?

606
00:43:00,511 --> 00:43:05,414
<i>The people of New York have spoken,
and I'm proud to be your next mayor.</i>

607
00:43:05,583 --> 00:43:07,847
So you had Walker on the payroll too, huh?

608
00:43:09,353 --> 00:43:10,820
Hedging your bets.

609
00:43:11,322 --> 00:43:13,017
Smart.

610
00:43:15,159 --> 00:43:16,922
Remind me never to cross you, boss.

611
00:43:17,094 --> 00:43:19,688
That's why I never put my name
on the payroll.

612
00:43:19,863 --> 00:43:22,832
Who needs money
when you have real power?

613
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:27,198
The politicians come and go,
but we'll be here forever.
