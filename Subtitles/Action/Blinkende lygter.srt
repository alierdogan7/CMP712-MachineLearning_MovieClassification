1
00:00:28,385 --> 00:00:31,900
Once in a while,
although not very often, -

2
00:00:32,145 --> 00:00:36,058
-you find a place where
the menu is irrelevant.

3
00:00:38,585 --> 00:00:44,581
Where you don't come merely to eat,
but just to be there.

4
00:00:44,785 --> 00:00:48,539
Just to sit in a quiet corner
watching the staff radiating...

5
00:00:48,745 --> 00:00:52,294
... a rare sense of satisfaction.

6
00:00:52,505 --> 00:00:55,941
And to watch them work.

7
00:01:01,225 --> 00:01:08,336
And suddenly you realise
that here, and only here, -

8
00:01:08,545 --> 00:01:12,379
- is where they've always belonged.

9
00:01:46,865 --> 00:01:50,062
Grown people, and they are fucking late?

10
00:01:50,265 --> 00:01:54,417
He's from Poland.
- So what? He should be here now!

11
00:02:29,665 --> 00:02:32,304
Don't be too hard on the guy.

12
00:02:35,625 --> 00:02:38,185
Why are you so late?

13
00:02:38,385 --> 00:02:42,344
What's he saying, Peter?
- It sounded like "diarrhea."

14
00:02:42,545 --> 00:02:49,303
Yeah, goulash gives drivers diarrhea.
So of course he is late.

15
00:02:49,545 --> 00:02:55,256
I've had diarrhea since I was 16.
Cigarettos?

16
00:02:57,345 --> 00:03:01,384
What the fuck's this?
The wrong brand! Now what?

17
00:03:02,785 --> 00:03:06,221
What the hell do we do
with 34,000 cartons of "Look"?

18
00:03:06,385 --> 00:03:09,661
Nobody smokes that menthol shit.

19
00:03:09,905 --> 00:03:12,817
Cigarettos..
- Arne, cool it!

20
00:03:13,025 --> 00:03:17,815
Peter, tell him!
- Take it easy, man ...

21
00:03:18,985 --> 00:03:22,500
Torkild!
- Cigarettos!

22
00:03:23,705 --> 00:03:27,300
Maybe we can trade them,
or something.

23
00:03:27,545 --> 00:03:31,333
He might not even notice.

24
00:03:31,585 --> 00:03:34,418
It's Torkild.
Get me the Eskimo.

25
00:03:39,225 --> 00:03:43,059
I know you'll never read it.
- I'll read it.

26
00:03:43,265 --> 00:03:45,825
MEN ARE FROM MARS,
WOMEN ARE FROM VENUS

27
00:03:46,025 --> 00:03:50,576
I gave it to you before,
but you threw it out.

28
00:03:50,745 --> 00:03:54,499
I'll ... I'll read it.
Thanks.

29
00:04:01,985 --> 00:04:05,739
Let's go back to your place.
- I've met someone.

30
00:04:05,945 --> 00:04:08,413
What?
- It's over.

31
00:04:08,625 --> 00:04:13,460
Look, when I've paid back the Eskimo...
- You've said that for five years.

32
00:04:13,665 --> 00:04:16,338
That's not true!

33
00:04:16,545 --> 00:04:19,855
I was just thinking about
starting my own business.

34
00:04:20,065 --> 00:04:23,694
Maybe a pet store.
- You couldn't feed a fish.

35
00:04:23,945 --> 00:04:27,779
I can learn. I could do anything.

36
00:04:27,985 --> 00:04:32,024
No, you can't.
You're 40 years old.

37
00:04:37,545 --> 00:04:42,983
Who is he?
- He works at the paper.

38
00:04:43,225 --> 00:04:46,661
What's his name?
- Don't you touch him.

39
00:04:51,225 --> 00:04:54,774
You're crazy about him?
- I guess so.

40
00:04:58,345 --> 00:05:01,496
You're going to have kids and stuff?
- Maybe.

41
00:05:01,745 --> 00:05:07,741
That's what regular people do. Have
kids, take them to Disneyland.

42
00:05:07,905 --> 00:05:11,295
Six Flags is better.
Not so many Canucks.

43
00:05:11,505 --> 00:05:15,100
Don't you care?

44
00:05:27,625 --> 00:05:32,415
Good luck.
- Yeah. You, too.

45
00:06:46,105 --> 00:06:53,864
A rifle ...
- A rifle? This bad boy is an AK-47!

46
00:06:54,065 --> 00:06:56,977
You know it can penetrate iron?

47
00:06:57,145 --> 00:07:02,344
Iron?
This baby can blow away suburbs.

48
00:07:02,545 --> 00:07:05,378
Give it to me, I'll show you.

49
00:07:13,865 --> 00:07:16,937
What took you so long?
- My mom called.

50
00:07:17,105 --> 00:07:21,656
We're opening the presents ...
- What did you give him?

51
00:07:21,865 --> 00:07:25,983
You remember that guy that shot
at the White House?

52
00:07:26,185 --> 00:07:32,021
A psychopath let off 20 shots at it.
- Never heard about it.

53
00:07:32,265 --> 00:07:37,703
Fuck that, he used an AK-47.
- Hanne chipped in, too.

54
00:07:37,865 --> 00:07:40,618
No I didn't, Stefan!

55
00:07:40,825 --> 00:07:46,457
It's very nice. What is it, a paint gun?
- What did she say?

56
00:07:46,625 --> 00:07:52,700
A paint gun ... It looks real.
- Of course it's not real.

57
00:07:52,905 --> 00:07:58,457
Uhh ... So you're Hanne?
Stefan talks about you all the time.

58
00:07:58,625 --> 00:08:03,380
We have met before?
- You remember Hanne.

59
00:08:03,585 --> 00:08:08,818
I was just ...
Yeah, yeah. Sure.

60
00:08:09,025 --> 00:08:14,145
Don't worry, I always forget her, too.
You like it, or what?

61
00:08:14,345 --> 00:08:17,655
Sure I do, it's ...

62
00:08:17,865 --> 00:08:20,015
I just need to ...

63
00:08:29,265 --> 00:08:33,702
Goddamn, Peter.
- You want some?

64
00:08:33,905 --> 00:08:39,457
I could have shot you.
- No harm done.

65
00:08:56,345 --> 00:08:58,461
Celebrating without me?

66
00:09:02,265 --> 00:09:06,178
Why the hell didn't we invite the Eskimo?

67
00:09:17,345 --> 00:09:20,417
You got your period, or what?

68
00:09:20,665 --> 00:09:22,576
No, I was just coming ...

69
00:09:27,425 --> 00:09:30,098
Happy birthday.

70
00:09:33,185 --> 00:09:35,096
Thanks.

71
00:09:37,585 --> 00:09:40,941
You got my money?
- No.

72
00:09:48,625 --> 00:09:50,741
Now you're mine, Torkild.

73
00:09:50,905 --> 00:09:54,261
Yeah ...

74
00:09:54,465 --> 00:09:59,619
You'll pick up a suitcase for me tonight.
- Okay, where?

75
00:09:59,825 --> 00:10:03,613
It's in a Greek diplomat's house.
In his money chest.

76
00:10:05,465 --> 00:10:08,741
His ..?
- His safe.

77
00:10:08,985 --> 00:10:15,697
Exactly. William will fill you in.
Don't open the suitcase.

78
00:10:15,945 --> 00:10:21,497
Can't I do one big job?
So I can pay you off once and for all?

79
00:10:21,705 --> 00:10:27,257
I'll do anything, just something new.
I almost shot Peter ...

80
00:10:27,425 --> 00:10:30,462
You're mine, Torkild.
Get the suitcase, capiche?

81
00:10:31,945 --> 00:10:35,494
Sure ...

82
00:10:44,585 --> 00:10:47,145
Shut up Arne, goddammit!

83
00:10:58,665 --> 00:11:02,135
Wow, what a mirror!
Great craftsmanship.

84
00:11:02,345 --> 00:11:05,655
Concentrate!
- We could take it with us ...

85
00:11:05,865 --> 00:11:08,254
We're not dragging that around, bozo.

86
00:11:08,425 --> 00:11:13,021
I've always wanted one of these.
You know what these things cost?

87
00:11:13,225 --> 00:11:16,661
Well bring it along.

88
00:11:21,105 --> 00:11:23,494
Look at this! Beautiful!

89
00:11:39,305 --> 00:11:42,058
Where's Stefan?

90
00:11:59,305 --> 00:12:02,581
What's that?

91
00:12:02,785 --> 00:12:07,939
Stuffed peppers. You want some?
- That's disgusting.

92
00:12:08,145 --> 00:12:12,502
There's some cold tzatziki, too.

93
00:12:12,705 --> 00:12:16,903
You mind giving a hand?
- Take it easy.

94
00:12:22,505 --> 00:12:24,461
Holy shit ...

95
00:12:34,305 --> 00:12:36,978
That's a lot of dough, Torkild.

96
00:12:53,705 --> 00:12:57,141
Torkild, he shot me.
Torkild, help me!

97
00:12:59,025 --> 00:13:02,335
Come on, out in the car.

98
00:13:14,745 --> 00:13:17,817
How come people have to keep
on talking when they're dying?

99
00:13:18,025 --> 00:13:24,419
I'll smack you if you don't shut up.
- I have to keep awake, I'm bleeding!

100
00:13:24,625 --> 00:13:28,334
It's a flesh wound!
I bleed more when I jerk off.

101
00:13:37,345 --> 00:13:39,575
You're bleeding on the money,
you pig!

102
00:13:39,785 --> 00:13:43,858
Don't bleed on the money, Peter!
- I'm cold, okay?

103
00:13:44,065 --> 00:13:47,102
That's because you've been shot.
Crybaby.

104
00:13:50,305 --> 00:13:52,865
What do we do now?

105
00:13:53,065 --> 00:13:56,853
Where are we going?

106
00:14:20,705 --> 00:14:24,061
Torkild?

107
00:14:32,705 --> 00:14:35,378
I want out.
- What?

108
00:14:35,585 --> 00:14:40,022
I want out.

109
00:14:41,905 --> 00:14:46,501
Torkild, help us out here.
- What do you want out of?

110
00:14:46,705 --> 00:14:53,019
I'm 40. I can't even have a birthday
party without shooting someone.

111
00:14:53,225 --> 00:14:56,183
I get an AK-44 for a present.
- 47.

112
00:14:56,345 --> 00:15:00,702
I should get a golf bag.
I should have a house in the country.

113
00:15:01,785 --> 00:15:05,539
The country?
- We can go there if you want.

114
00:15:05,745 --> 00:15:12,264
No! I don't want to go to the country.
- Then what do you want?

115
00:15:15,345 --> 00:15:20,021
How much cash do you think there is?
- Three or four million?

116
00:15:20,225 --> 00:15:22,341
But the Eskimo would kill us.

117
00:15:24,705 --> 00:15:29,540
I'll never have that much again.
- That's right! Let's go!

118
00:15:29,745 --> 00:15:32,213
Barcelona?
Where Coke Henry got the clap?

119
00:15:32,425 --> 00:15:34,939
Fine, let's go there.

120
00:15:35,145 --> 00:15:38,182
As long as we keep a low profile.
- What's going on?

121
00:15:38,385 --> 00:15:41,934
For how long?
- Until I know what I want.

122
00:15:42,865 --> 00:15:46,175
We can't.
I can't.

123
00:15:48,305 --> 00:15:51,741
Hanne's making brunch.

124
00:15:51,945 --> 00:15:55,620
You'll get 1 00,000 each if you come.

125
00:15:55,825 --> 00:16:01,502
I need medical care, now!
- It went straight through you.

126
00:16:01,705 --> 00:16:05,380
You'll be fine in a couple of days.
Let's try out Torkild's idea.

127
00:16:55,545 --> 00:17:00,300
I should have left a note for Hanne.
- Shut up, Stefan.

128
00:17:00,545 --> 00:17:03,378
She'd never have let you leave.

129
00:17:03,585 --> 00:17:06,782
Women don't know
how to say goodbye.

130
00:17:06,985 --> 00:17:12,264
They don't like endings. That's why
they watch "Days Of Our Lives."

131
00:17:12,465 --> 00:17:14,376
They never end.

132
00:17:17,345 --> 00:17:21,782
I saw all of "Rich Man, Poor Man."
- That's only four episodes.

133
00:17:21,985 --> 00:17:25,978
No, there were at least six.
- In "Rich Man, Poor Man"?

134
00:17:26,185 --> 00:17:31,464
Yeah, the one with Falconetti?
- There's only six episodes.

135
00:17:31,665 --> 00:17:35,578
There are eight. I watched them.

136
00:17:37,865 --> 00:17:41,460
You guys seen it?
- I should have left a note.

137
00:17:41,665 --> 00:17:46,455
I taped it. I never saw it.
- Weren't there 24?

138
00:17:46,665 --> 00:17:50,738
I don't remember.
- I'm positive.

139
00:18:07,105 --> 00:18:11,576
No, we're definitely here.
Arne, concentrate, will you?

140
00:18:11,745 --> 00:18:15,579
There's a hell of a lot of trees.
- Can't we take a real road?

141
00:18:15,785 --> 00:18:21,815
Yeah, this one. The border's here.
- Yeah. Take a right next time.

142
00:18:28,545 --> 00:18:31,582
I don't fucking believe this!

143
00:18:37,425 --> 00:18:42,738
Where are your brains, Arne?
I said a getaway car!

144
00:18:42,945 --> 00:18:46,654
And you find this ...
- Fucking spasmobile.

145
00:18:46,865 --> 00:18:52,258
Fucking spasmobile!
- You wanted something low-key.

146
00:18:52,505 --> 00:18:54,575
And what do you call this?

147
00:18:54,825 --> 00:18:59,137
No thanks! Get your shit
and let's get out of here.

148
00:20:04,705 --> 00:20:10,098
Why are we stopping here?
- We can spend the night here.

149
00:21:00,585 --> 00:21:05,022
It must be an old inn or something.
- Or a stable!

150
00:21:10,665 --> 00:21:15,944
This is really the sticks.
- It's disgusting. Bird shit everywhere.

151
00:21:17,665 --> 00:21:21,897
It's okay for a night.
- Exactly.

152
00:22:27,305 --> 00:22:31,821
What did I tell you, Torkild?
It'll bear fruit this year.

153
00:22:32,025 --> 00:22:34,539
Now you see
why we bought this place.

154
00:22:34,745 --> 00:22:36,701
There's only three.
- So what?

155
00:22:36,905 --> 00:22:41,023
Some have lots,
and some have few.

156
00:22:41,225 --> 00:22:44,501
And ours has three.
- Mine.

157
00:22:44,705 --> 00:22:48,937
It's my apple tree!
They're my apples.

158
00:22:49,145 --> 00:22:55,664
Can't we get a bigger place soon?
- Are you nuts? We can't move now.

159
00:22:55,865 --> 00:23:00,143
And why should we?
- I want my own room.

160
00:23:00,345 --> 00:23:02,813
Stop it, Torkild!

161
00:23:43,425 --> 00:23:47,737
Did you eat one of Dad's apples?
You know what they mean to him.

162
00:23:47,945 --> 00:23:51,858
For 1 8 years he's been going on
about that tree.

163
00:23:52,065 --> 00:23:55,694
I want my own room.
- Shut up!

164
00:23:55,865 --> 00:24:01,303
Dad's tree is bearing fruit.
We've waited so long, understand?

165
00:24:01,465 --> 00:24:05,378
Promise me
you'll leave the last two alone.

166
00:24:05,585 --> 00:24:10,340
Then can I get my own room?
- Just promise me that.

167
00:24:13,465 --> 00:24:17,219
I promise
I'll leave the last two alone.

168
00:24:19,305 --> 00:24:21,216
Paul!

169
00:24:33,105 --> 00:24:35,858
What's that?
- An apple.

170
00:24:36,065 --> 00:24:40,741
It was an apple.
How could you do this to us?

171
00:24:40,945 --> 00:24:47,293
Why, Torkild?
Don't you care about your family?

172
00:24:47,505 --> 00:24:53,262
Torkild, can't you understand there
are things you don't do to people?

173
00:24:53,465 --> 00:24:56,980
Everyone needs something
that's just theirs.

174
00:24:57,185 --> 00:25:02,703
So promise me
you'll let the last apple be.

175
00:25:29,145 --> 00:25:36,062
Come here, you! What the hell are
you trying to do? Are you crazy?

176
00:25:36,265 --> 00:25:41,623
Your father can't stop crying.
You go apologise to him right now!

177
00:25:45,065 --> 00:25:47,898
Paul ...

178
00:25:57,505 --> 00:26:00,463
Torkild!

179
00:26:02,865 --> 00:26:07,700
Peter's sick.
You'd better come.

180
00:26:07,905 --> 00:26:11,580
Come on, get up.
- Leave me alone.

181
00:26:11,785 --> 00:26:17,655
Stop it, Arne!
- Arne, put him down.

182
00:26:21,265 --> 00:26:25,144
Torkild, I don't feel so good.

183
00:26:25,345 --> 00:26:28,417
Can you move?
- Think I'd be lying here if I could?

184
00:26:28,625 --> 00:26:32,937
I need water, and a doctor.
- And a cheeseburger?

185
00:26:33,145 --> 00:26:36,103
Check if there's a doctor outside.
- Get some water.

186
00:26:36,305 --> 00:26:41,174
We have to get going.
- Shut up and get some water!

187
00:26:43,145 --> 00:26:47,661
I feel weird, weird ...
Is it bad?

188
00:26:47,865 --> 00:26:51,380
It doesn't look too good.
- Torkild!

189
00:26:51,545 --> 00:26:54,059
Someone's coming.

190
00:27:02,225 --> 00:27:06,184
Who's that clown?
- Who is it?

191
00:27:06,385 --> 00:27:10,617
It's empty, you jerk.
- Who the fuck is it?

192
00:27:10,825 --> 00:27:14,704
It's a ... hunter.
- Stay here.

193
00:27:20,625 --> 00:27:24,379
I once fired one of those.

194
00:27:34,105 --> 00:27:38,178
Howdy!
- How ... dy.

195
00:27:38,385 --> 00:27:42,344
I hope you got it cheap?
- Cheap?

196
00:27:42,585 --> 00:27:46,180
That pile of shit's been empty
for 20 years.

197
00:27:46,385 --> 00:27:51,584
We were scared they'd make
it into a refugee camp.

198
00:27:51,785 --> 00:27:55,698
We can't have a flock of boat people
running around here.

199
00:27:55,905 --> 00:28:00,899
No, of course not.
- You're not from the Red Cross?

200
00:28:01,065 --> 00:28:05,934
No, no. Don't worry.

201
00:28:06,105 --> 00:28:09,461
We just bought the place.

202
00:28:09,665 --> 00:28:15,058
You guys opening a restaurant?
- Yeah, that's right.

203
00:28:15,265 --> 00:28:22,853
Not a pizza joint, I hope?
- No, just a ... nice family restaurant.

204
00:28:23,065 --> 00:28:25,977
We used to eat here, my dad and I.

205
00:28:29,305 --> 00:28:36,017
We liked it.
- Yeah ... it's a nice place.

206
00:28:37,225 --> 00:28:41,457
We really liked it.

207
00:28:43,385 --> 00:28:47,742
Well, you'd better
put those boys to work.

208
00:28:47,905 --> 00:28:52,695
Those two look like lazy bums.
Keep after them!

209
00:28:52,865 --> 00:28:59,703
See you around.
- You know where to find a doctor?

210
00:28:59,865 --> 00:29:05,815
One of them's feeling bad.
- He's just trying to get off work.

211
00:29:06,065 --> 00:29:09,978
No, he's really sick.
We need a doctor.

212
00:29:32,825 --> 00:29:36,659
Carl?
- That's me.

213
00:29:36,905 --> 00:29:40,500
He's inside.

214
00:29:43,505 --> 00:29:47,862
How did this happen?
- It was a hunting accident.

215
00:29:50,265 --> 00:29:52,620
I've seen a few hunting accidents.

216
00:29:52,865 --> 00:29:56,380
But this isn't one of them.

217
00:29:56,545 --> 00:30:01,175
I'll pay you to fix him up.
- No, no, I can't ...

218
00:30:01,425 --> 00:30:05,054
I've got plenty of money ...
if this stays between us.

219
00:30:05,265 --> 00:30:07,221
That kind of thing is expensive.

220
00:30:17,665 --> 00:30:19,656
There.

221
00:30:22,105 --> 00:30:25,142
Okay.

222
00:30:32,625 --> 00:30:36,140
He's got to lie still for two weeks.
- Two weeks?

223
00:30:36,385 --> 00:30:39,343
He can't.
He's got to ride with us.

224
00:30:39,505 --> 00:30:43,180
No! Any movement could kill him.
The wound could open.

225
00:30:43,345 --> 00:30:48,419
He has to lie still,
drink plenty of fluids, and eat salt.

226
00:30:48,585 --> 00:30:51,622
We don't have any salt.
- I'll give you a ride into town.

227
00:30:51,785 --> 00:30:55,334
That's your treatment?
- Yup.

228
00:30:55,585 --> 00:30:58,418
You're not going to do anything else?
- Nope.

229
00:31:00,825 --> 00:31:02,816
I'll go with him.

230
00:31:02,985 --> 00:31:06,819
Torkild ... that guy's a psycho.
Want me to go along?

231
00:31:07,065 --> 00:31:09,340
No, stay here.

232
00:31:23,585 --> 00:31:27,055
You're losing some of that.
- Thanks.

233
00:31:27,265 --> 00:31:31,736
I don't know who you are,
or why you shot him.

234
00:31:31,905 --> 00:31:37,457
If you want to run a business here,
you have to stop shooting each other.

235
00:31:37,705 --> 00:31:42,415
We don't do that around here.
- No.

236
00:32:06,025 --> 00:32:10,621
What's taking him so long?
It's not like Torkild.

237
00:32:10,825 --> 00:32:13,100
Shut up.

238
00:32:13,305 --> 00:32:16,581
He took all the money?
- Sniff your shit.

239
00:32:16,785 --> 00:32:19,743
I did. It's all gone.

240
00:32:35,465 --> 00:32:37,535
Here he comes.

241
00:32:47,505 --> 00:32:52,374
Howdy.
- "Howdy"?

242
00:32:52,545 --> 00:32:55,264
What's that?
- A van.

243
00:32:56,145 --> 00:33:00,855
You bought a van?
- Yeah. It fits our alibi.

244
00:33:01,065 --> 00:33:05,138
Our what?
- Give me a hand.

245
00:33:13,025 --> 00:33:16,222
What the hell's that?
- What are you doing?

246
00:33:16,425 --> 00:33:21,294
What's all this junk?
- It's not junk, it's culture.

247
00:33:21,465 --> 00:33:25,504
Why should Arne be the only one
of us to see "Rich Man, Poor Man "?

248
00:33:25,705 --> 00:33:31,337
It's a cultural treasure in eight episodes,
and only Arne has seen it.

249
00:33:33,545 --> 00:33:36,457
I've bought eight thousand worth
of culture.

250
00:33:36,705 --> 00:33:43,258
There's Karen Blixen,
and Hans Christian Andersen ...

251
00:33:43,465 --> 00:33:46,616
Fuck Hans Christian Andersen!
- No, Arne. We can't.

252
00:33:46,825 --> 00:33:53,663
And there'll be no more
"fuck" or "shit." Say "darn."

253
00:33:53,865 --> 00:33:58,461
We'll be here two weeks,
so we have to fit in.

254
00:33:58,665 --> 00:34:01,816
What about Barcelona?
- You heard Carl.

255
00:34:02,025 --> 00:34:04,983
He was hammered!

256
00:34:05,185 --> 00:34:07,983
He wasn't ...
- Shut the fuck up!

257
00:34:11,465 --> 00:34:14,377
You want to take the back road
to Barcelona?

258
00:34:14,585 --> 00:34:16,496
Knock it off, you idiot!

259
00:34:16,745 --> 00:34:21,819
Fuck you.
- No more cursing.

260
00:34:22,065 --> 00:34:24,977
Don't you see?
This a chance for us.

261
00:34:25,225 --> 00:34:28,183
Those rednecks think
we're opening a restaurant.

262
00:34:28,345 --> 00:34:34,341
We just need to do a little work
on it, and they'll leave us alone.

263
00:34:34,505 --> 00:34:38,214
You're my crew.

264
00:34:38,425 --> 00:34:43,977
I'm not your fucking crew.
- It's just until Peter gets well.

265
00:34:44,225 --> 00:34:47,501
Then we go to Barcelona.

266
00:34:47,705 --> 00:34:51,015
Come on, give me a hand.

267
00:34:58,985 --> 00:35:01,624
They're gone.

268
00:35:03,505 --> 00:35:06,781
What do you mean?
- They vanished.

269
00:35:06,985 --> 00:35:10,295
No one's seen them,
and the suitcase is gone.

270
00:35:11,705 --> 00:35:14,219
Fuck me.

271
00:35:14,425 --> 00:35:16,893
What do we do?
- We wait.

272
00:35:17,145 --> 00:35:21,218
They'll make a mistake.
And then we knock.

273
00:35:21,425 --> 00:35:25,259
We strike.
- That, too.

274
00:35:28,625 --> 00:35:33,745
Go. You're disturbing my fish.

275
00:35:44,905 --> 00:35:47,942
When they made cannons
in the old days, -

276
00:35:48,145 --> 00:35:51,535
- the gunsmith had to sit on it
the first time it was fired.

277
00:35:51,785 --> 00:35:56,984
There were so many bad cannons.
They blew up when you fired them.

278
00:35:57,185 --> 00:36:02,896
So the king said the gunsmiths had
to sit on them for the first shot.

279
00:36:03,145 --> 00:36:09,459
Arne, we've had frozen pizzas
for five days now.

280
00:36:09,665 --> 00:36:12,179
Who fixed the oven? Me.

281
00:36:12,345 --> 00:36:16,099
You can fix your own oven.
Just shut the fuck up.

282
00:36:16,305 --> 00:36:20,059
There's all kinds of
vegetable shit in this.

283
00:36:20,225 --> 00:36:24,662
It was a good idea.
- To sit on a cannon?

284
00:36:24,865 --> 00:36:30,064
I mean, being responsible.
- I won't eat this shit anymore!

285
00:36:37,065 --> 00:36:41,934
How many guns have you sold?
- I don't know.

286
00:36:42,185 --> 00:36:44,653
What if one of them
gets you shot one day?

287
00:36:44,905 --> 00:36:49,581
What do you think?
I'd take the guy bowling.

288
00:36:53,065 --> 00:36:57,616
But who's responsible?
- I did 1 6 months, didn't I?

289
00:36:57,865 --> 00:37:01,460
Who cares if he sold
bazookas to O.J. Simpson?

290
00:37:01,665 --> 00:37:05,783
I need food, I need a bath!
I need some coke!

291
00:37:07,105 --> 00:37:09,494
You can't have any.
- I've got to!

292
00:37:09,705 --> 00:37:15,063
I've got to have something
for my nose, or I'll go crazy.

293
00:37:16,825 --> 00:37:20,659
Torkild! Look at me.

294
00:37:20,825 --> 00:37:22,816
Look at me, Torkild!

295
00:37:24,945 --> 00:37:27,254
You've got to help me.

296
00:37:30,025 --> 00:37:33,381
I can't, Peter.

297
00:37:33,545 --> 00:37:36,343
Arne ...

298
00:37:52,265 --> 00:37:55,541
Yeah?
- It's Peter.

299
00:37:55,745 --> 00:38:00,739
Peter who?
- Peter ... you know.

300
00:38:00,905 --> 00:38:05,581
Henry, I need a few bags.
- Where are you?

301
00:38:05,785 --> 00:38:11,860
Henry, I need a lot.
- Okay, but where are you?

302
00:38:12,065 --> 00:38:15,296
I don't know ...

303
00:38:20,265 --> 00:38:24,622
Newport.
We could meet at the docks.

304
00:38:37,465 --> 00:38:41,424
I need it now.
- You'll get it Wednesday.

305
00:38:41,625 --> 00:38:46,301
Okay, Newport docks.
Damn!

306
00:38:48,105 --> 00:38:53,020
What the hell are you doing, Peter?
You trying to get us all killed?

307
00:38:53,265 --> 00:38:55,221
I warned you, Torkild.

308
00:38:58,705 --> 00:39:01,173
Arne!

309
00:39:04,265 --> 00:39:07,302
I told you!

310
00:39:07,465 --> 00:39:10,537
What's going on?

311
00:39:10,705 --> 00:39:13,697
He stays in there.
- He'll suffocate.

312
00:39:13,945 --> 00:39:17,176
No, he won't.
He was calling Coke Henry.

313
00:39:17,425 --> 00:39:20,417
So why can't I call Hanne?
- I stopped him in time.

314
00:39:20,625 --> 00:39:25,141
Cool it, now.
- Come out, I'll kill you!

315
00:39:41,425 --> 00:39:43,381
He promises not to do it again.

316
00:39:43,625 --> 00:39:47,538
He broke the rules,
he must be punished.

317
00:40:10,345 --> 00:40:12,301
Let's go outside.
- Shut up.

318
00:40:12,545 --> 00:40:16,743
He'll kill us. He can't stand smoke.
- He won't find out shit.

319
00:40:17,865 --> 00:40:19,776
It's actually my granddad's fault.

320
00:40:21,305 --> 00:40:26,379
He caught my dad smoking and put
him in a closet with 50 smokes.

321
00:40:26,625 --> 00:40:31,380
He had to smoke them all.
He's completely crazy.

322
00:40:32,905 --> 00:40:35,100
What did you say?

323
00:40:40,505 --> 00:40:42,496
In you go, Peter.

324
00:40:47,305 --> 00:40:52,254
Okay. You can come out
when you've smoked them all.

325
00:41:17,345 --> 00:41:21,054
No, Peter's busy.

326
00:41:21,305 --> 00:41:25,218
No, I don't know when
he'll have time.

327
00:41:27,265 --> 00:41:29,859
Have you smoked them?

328
00:41:30,025 --> 00:41:35,418
No.
- Then you stay there.

329
00:41:37,625 --> 00:41:41,743
Happy birthday to you

330
00:41:41,985 --> 00:41:46,820
Happy birthday to you

331
00:41:47,025 --> 00:41:51,940
happy birthday, dear Peter
Happy birthday to you...

332
00:41:59,745 --> 00:42:02,020
Here.
- Thanks.

333
00:42:02,185 --> 00:42:05,700
Happy birthday.

334
00:42:07,305 --> 00:42:09,261
Come and join the guests.

335
00:42:15,825 --> 00:42:18,464
Nice gravy.

336
00:42:31,105 --> 00:42:34,734
Call an ambulance!

337
00:42:46,625 --> 00:42:50,504
Come out, Peter, hurry!
Your father's had a stroke.

338
00:42:50,745 --> 00:42:53,703
Hurry up, now.
- Is he dead?

339
00:42:53,905 --> 00:42:56,658
No, no. But hurry!

340
00:43:09,065 --> 00:43:12,375
Let me out!
- Torkild, he needs methadone.

341
00:43:12,585 --> 00:43:14,541
No! We don't use that around here.

342
00:43:15,825 --> 00:43:22,298
Okay ... If they don't use that here,
we'll do things the proper way.

343
00:43:22,465 --> 00:43:27,459
Give him food, water and salt.
And ... this.

344
00:43:29,785 --> 00:43:33,460
You sure about that?
- Are you a doctor?

345
00:43:33,665 --> 00:43:36,862
No ...
- Then do as I say.

346
00:43:37,825 --> 00:43:41,943
He's plastered, Torkild.
- Arne ...

347
00:43:42,185 --> 00:43:45,222
You are! You shouldn't be driving.
It's illegal.

348
00:43:45,465 --> 00:43:50,778
That's a very serious accusation!

349
00:43:51,025 --> 00:43:53,619
That's enough, Arne.
Don't mind him ...

350
00:43:53,785 --> 00:43:58,575
We ought to lock him up.
- Barcelona ...

351
00:44:06,785 --> 00:44:09,060
Arne!

352
00:44:09,305 --> 00:44:13,264
Let me out, Arne!
I've got to get to Newport.

353
00:44:13,425 --> 00:44:16,781
Let me out!

354
00:44:32,745 --> 00:44:35,942
They're not there.
- I told you so.

355
00:44:36,105 --> 00:44:39,734
They're screwing you around, Dagur.

356
00:44:41,745 --> 00:44:44,305
Let's go ...

357
00:44:44,505 --> 00:44:50,501
We stay. We paid to cross the
fucking bridge, so now we stay.

358
00:44:52,465 --> 00:44:57,698
They're fucking with you.
They could be anywhere.

359
00:44:57,945 --> 00:45:02,257
I can feel they're here.
- What can you feel?

360
00:45:15,945 --> 00:45:22,578
Fuck, man!
I always wanted to see the country.

361
00:45:34,825 --> 00:45:39,774
Peter ...

362
00:45:58,825 --> 00:46:02,977
I want to get out.
- You will.

363
00:46:03,185 --> 00:46:07,303
Can I? I'll be good.

364
00:46:07,465 --> 00:46:12,858
Can you walk?
- Just let me out. I'll be good.

365
00:46:22,745 --> 00:46:27,216
Peter, what the hell are you doing?

366
00:46:27,425 --> 00:46:30,497
I want to get out.
- You are out, man.

367
00:46:30,665 --> 00:46:33,259
Further out.
- Peter?

368
00:46:33,465 --> 00:46:35,695
How are you feeling?

369
00:46:35,905 --> 00:46:40,979
Torkild, can I get further out?
- Of course.

370
00:46:41,225 --> 00:46:46,697
You don't want to shower first?
- No, I just want to get out.

371
00:46:51,225 --> 00:46:53,819
Hey, where the fuck you going?
- Out.

372
00:46:54,025 --> 00:46:56,300
Can't you slow down a bit?

373
00:47:01,625 --> 00:47:05,584
Fuck, you stink!
Can't you smell it?

374
00:47:07,785 --> 00:47:10,379
You okay, Peter?

375
00:47:10,585 --> 00:47:12,735
Can we leave now?

376
00:47:12,945 --> 00:47:15,334
Torkild! Peter's okay.
Let's get out of here.

377
00:47:15,545 --> 00:47:21,142
Sure, but slow down ...
- Don't tell me, tell him.

378
00:47:34,465 --> 00:47:36,615
Peter, for chrissakes!

379
00:47:41,945 --> 00:47:44,743
Wow!

380
00:47:44,905 --> 00:47:47,817
It's beautiful.

381
00:47:49,345 --> 00:47:53,463
You're standing on a condom.

382
00:47:55,785 --> 00:47:58,424
There's a little soup left ...

383
00:47:58,625 --> 00:48:03,779
Look at kid brother here!
He ain't grown up yet.

384
00:48:08,705 --> 00:48:12,141
Shit, what an idiot!
He will get sick now.

385
00:48:12,305 --> 00:48:15,820
That water's not cold.

386
00:48:26,985 --> 00:48:29,704
It's fucking cold!

387
00:48:41,425 --> 00:48:44,656
Torkild, you're chicken!

388
00:48:55,105 --> 00:48:58,541
We're going to Barcelona!

389
00:49:35,305 --> 00:49:38,980
Peter?

390
00:49:39,145 --> 00:49:44,538
Peter, we have to go.
- I need some more sleep.

391
00:49:44,745 --> 00:49:48,624
Hey. What the fuck's happened here?

392
00:49:51,425 --> 00:49:55,384
Where's the money, Torkild?
- Aren't we leaving?

393
00:49:57,585 --> 00:50:00,338
I bought the place.

394
00:50:00,585 --> 00:50:06,342
1 .7 million. It was a bargain.
All the ground's included.

395
00:50:11,345 --> 00:50:13,620
Why are you doing this?

396
00:50:15,585 --> 00:50:20,784
I don't want to go to Barcelona.
I want a place of my own.

397
00:50:20,985 --> 00:50:24,295
All I want is right here.
The woods, the beach ... you guys.

398
00:50:24,505 --> 00:50:27,622
Don't you see?
We'll do it.

399
00:50:27,865 --> 00:50:30,459
Do what, Torkild?
- Open a restaurant.

400
00:50:30,665 --> 00:50:34,340
No, we're going to Barcelona.
We can't even fry an egg!

401
00:50:34,505 --> 00:50:39,784
We can learn.
- One and half million, and no roof?

402
00:50:40,025 --> 00:50:44,098
I'm going to Barcelona, okay?
- Well, I'm staying here.

403
00:50:44,265 --> 00:50:50,022
You'll get paid.
- I want 28,500 a month, like Hanne.

404
00:50:50,185 --> 00:50:52,904
No problem.
- Stop this right now.

405
00:50:53,065 --> 00:50:55,260
Are we going or what?
- No, we're staying.

406
00:50:55,425 --> 00:50:58,064
Okay ...

407
00:50:58,305 --> 00:51:00,375
See? Peter wants to stay.

408
00:51:05,557 --> 00:51:11,075
Arne, look!

409
00:51:15,677 --> 00:51:17,793
Hi there ...

410
00:51:17,957 --> 00:51:21,108
You got him!
- What the hell are you doing?

411
00:51:22,517 --> 00:51:25,190
You can't just shoot the animals!

412
00:51:25,397 --> 00:51:27,388
It was a squirrel ...

413
00:51:27,637 --> 00:51:32,631
I don't give a fuck! You can't
keep doing this. Give me that.

414
00:51:32,877 --> 00:51:35,232
It was a squirrel!
- So what?

415
00:51:35,437 --> 00:51:38,509
No more shooting.
They don't do that here.

416
00:51:38,757 --> 00:51:43,467
What if the Eskimo comes?
- Stop shooting, then he won't.

417
00:51:57,717 --> 00:52:04,065
How about "The Golden Rooster"?
- Nah ... sounds like a roadhouse.

418
00:52:04,237 --> 00:52:07,752
I preferred "The Ritz."
- That's too swanky.

419
00:52:07,957 --> 00:52:11,074
We need something catchy.

420
00:52:22,117 --> 00:52:24,073
Stefan?

421
00:52:24,237 --> 00:52:28,515
What is it, Stefan?
- Something wrong?

422
00:52:28,717 --> 00:52:32,869
It's just so ... beautiful.

423
00:52:33,037 --> 00:52:35,028
Listen:

424
00:52:35,237 --> 00:52:41,790
In the long night where memory strays
lights from the past flicker on

425
00:52:41,997 --> 00:52:49,756
distant signals from childhood days
to a fearful heart on the run

426
00:52:53,157 --> 00:52:57,196
There's more ...

427
00:52:57,397 --> 00:53:03,745
someone who wants to share your nights
and your days will never get far

428
00:53:03,917 --> 00:53:11,676
your life lies behind in the flickering lights
and no-one will know who you are.

429
00:53:15,717 --> 00:53:18,026
Must be something missing.

430
00:53:18,277 --> 00:53:20,507
What's it called again?

431
00:53:20,717 --> 00:53:25,791
"Flickering Lanterns" ...
by Mily Dickinson.

432
00:53:25,997 --> 00:53:30,513
The mice have been at
Mily Dickinson's book.

433
00:53:30,717 --> 00:53:36,269
It's all right, nothing's missing.
Mily Dickinson is a famous poet.

434
00:53:36,517 --> 00:53:40,396
It's good that Stefan's reading.
- But what does it mean?

435
00:53:40,637 --> 00:53:43,026
Who cares!

436
00:53:43,277 --> 00:53:46,633
Stefan, are you crying over a poem?
- No.

437
00:53:46,877 --> 00:53:52,554
It's a metaphor.
- What kind of crap is that?

438
00:53:52,797 --> 00:53:56,392
Are we literary critics now?
- Arne, cool it.

439
00:53:56,597 --> 00:54:01,193
And your brain hasn't worked
since you got out of the freezer.

440
00:54:01,357 --> 00:54:06,636
Stefan! Are you crying over a poem?
- No, no ...

441
00:54:08,117 --> 00:54:11,314
Jesus, is this a sauna club or what?

442
00:54:11,517 --> 00:54:15,874
Bunch of faggots.
- I'm sorry.

443
00:54:16,077 --> 00:54:20,150
No, I liked that, "Flickering Lanterns."

444
00:54:20,317 --> 00:54:24,310
So did I. It sounds good.

445
00:54:24,517 --> 00:54:29,068
So let's call the place that.

446
00:54:31,557 --> 00:54:35,755
How much does all this cost?
- Don't worry about it.

447
00:54:35,957 --> 00:54:39,154
Stefan, help us.
- There's no handles.

448
00:54:39,357 --> 00:54:42,394
I'd like to know how much is left.
- There's plenty.

449
00:54:42,597 --> 00:54:46,715
Why can't those two help?
- Just leave them alone.

450
00:54:47,877 --> 00:54:52,632
Now we've got a real refrigerator.
- Never mind that.

451
00:54:52,837 --> 00:54:57,865
Beers should be cooled in the ground.
That's just how it is.

452
00:54:58,077 --> 00:55:02,753
It's a question of finding
the right depth.

453
00:55:04,517 --> 00:55:07,873
If it's too shallow,
the frost gets them.

454
00:55:08,117 --> 00:55:11,871
You want a hand?
- No, no. Just wait.

455
00:55:12,077 --> 00:55:15,592
You'll be digging plenty of holes.

456
00:55:15,797 --> 00:55:19,551
It can take years to
find your personal depth.

457
00:55:21,877 --> 00:55:25,187
How do you know
when you've found it?

458
00:55:25,397 --> 00:55:28,673
You can taste it.

459
00:55:28,877 --> 00:55:33,268
One day,
you'll take one out and taste it, -

460
00:55:33,517 --> 00:55:36,509
- and it's as if
the heavens open up for you.

461
00:55:36,757 --> 00:55:42,514
All your sorrows are gone.
You're at peace with yourself.

462
00:55:42,717 --> 00:55:45,789
You're in a state of joy!

463
00:55:45,997 --> 00:55:47,908
Earth-cooled joy.

464
00:55:48,917 --> 00:55:52,956
Howdy!

465
00:55:53,157 --> 00:55:58,231
How's the work going?
A little housewarming present.

466
00:55:58,437 --> 00:56:02,953
My dad shot it,
over on the other side of the lake.

467
00:56:03,157 --> 00:56:08,709
We're busy, Alfred.
- Oh? Sorry ...

468
00:56:08,877 --> 00:56:13,507
Then I won't be bothering you.
Very sorry about that ...

469
00:56:13,717 --> 00:56:16,595
See you later, Alfred.

470
00:56:16,797 --> 00:56:22,030
Yes. Well ...

471
00:56:22,197 --> 00:56:25,075
Say hi to Torkild.

472
00:56:25,317 --> 00:56:28,787
Bye, Alfred.
He's not all there.

473
00:56:31,557 --> 00:56:34,993
Now. Dig your own hole!

474
00:57:04,917 --> 00:57:08,148
You call that a sauce?
- What else?

475
00:57:08,357 --> 00:57:13,829
I could think of many things,
but not "sauce." Start again.

476
00:57:14,037 --> 00:57:19,157
You can't be serious.
- You should care for it like a human being.

477
00:57:19,317 --> 00:57:27,156
It needs constant attention
and massive amounts of love.

478
00:57:27,357 --> 00:57:31,635
This sauce hasn't had that.
It's merely a fetus.

479
00:57:31,877 --> 00:57:34,869
You calling my sauce a fetus?

480
00:57:37,597 --> 00:57:42,990
It's sloppy.
It needs wisdom and care.

481
00:57:43,157 --> 00:57:49,187
Make a new one, and give it what
it deserves. And a lot more wine.

482
00:57:49,397 --> 00:57:53,834
It's only a sauce!
I can't take this much longer, Torkild.

483
00:57:54,037 --> 00:57:56,028
You have to learn.

484
00:57:56,197 --> 00:57:58,950
I'm finished.

485
00:57:59,117 --> 00:58:04,714
Good, Peter.
Now clean up.

486
00:58:04,917 --> 00:58:07,715
While we're waiting for the sauce.

487
00:58:10,997 --> 00:58:14,228
Where did you learn to cook,
anyway?

488
00:58:14,437 --> 00:58:18,589
I was married to a woman
who couldn't cook.

489
00:58:18,797 --> 00:58:22,107
I cooked for my wife and kids
for 1 7 years.

490
00:58:22,317 --> 00:58:26,356
I think I know how to cook!
- Take it easy.

491
00:58:26,557 --> 00:58:30,186
We can stop now.
- No, it's good to be cooking again.

492
00:58:30,437 --> 00:58:33,429
When you're alone, you don't bother.

493
00:58:33,597 --> 00:58:37,795
How did she die?
- A drunk driver.

494
00:58:37,997 --> 00:58:41,990
A station wagon.
Completely irresponsible.

495
00:58:42,237 --> 00:58:47,630
They went to pick up my mother
at the train station, and ... bang!

496
00:58:47,797 --> 00:58:51,233
Henrik, my eldest son,
died on New Year's day.

497
00:58:56,197 --> 00:59:02,432
Did you get the driver?
- He died, too. They all died.

498
00:59:05,557 --> 00:59:09,391
But you still can't teach me
how to make a sauce!

499
00:59:09,557 --> 00:59:15,154
Right, Arne?
- I'm taking my break now!

500
00:59:16,997 --> 00:59:19,670
You're useless, Arne!

501
00:59:22,237 --> 00:59:24,626
Hi ...

502
00:59:26,517 --> 00:59:28,826
Is Stefan here?

503
00:59:40,597 --> 00:59:43,270
Hanne ...
- Hi.

504
00:59:48,877 --> 00:59:53,314
Are you here?
- It's a great place.

505
00:59:53,557 --> 00:59:56,515
How did you find us?
- What do you mean?

506
00:59:56,677 --> 00:59:59,635
Didn't you tell them I was coming?
- I didn't know.

507
00:59:59,837 --> 01:00:04,467
I told you.
- Stefan, did you call her?

508
01:00:04,717 --> 01:00:06,628
For chrissakes ...

509
01:00:06,837 --> 01:00:10,147
I told you not to come.
- Take it easy!

510
01:00:10,357 --> 01:00:14,873
Bet she brought the Eskimo along.
- Your stupid friends can stay away.

511
01:00:15,037 --> 01:00:18,154
Especially now with the baby coming.

512
01:00:18,357 --> 01:00:22,396
Holy shit ...
- What about the soup?

513
01:00:22,597 --> 01:00:25,873
Come on, Arne ...
- The baby coming?

514
01:00:26,917 --> 01:00:31,752
I couldn't tell you on the phone.
You're going to be a dad.

515
01:00:31,957 --> 01:00:36,553
We're going to be a little family!

516
01:00:39,277 --> 01:00:44,305
Aren't you happy?
- Sure ...

517
01:00:47,277 --> 01:00:49,996
You fucking bet.

518
01:01:09,477 --> 01:01:13,231
Those two are going to smash up
the whole place.

519
01:01:13,437 --> 01:01:19,069
I just painted that ceiling!
- Ssh. Watch the film.

520
01:01:22,677 --> 01:01:24,793
Oh, so she bought one too?

521
01:01:24,997 --> 01:01:28,910
Yeah, he gets one, too.
For being kind.

522
01:01:29,117 --> 01:01:34,589
He turns into a faggot later on.
- Don't tell us!

523
01:01:42,077 --> 01:01:44,910
Can you fuck like that
when you're pregnant?

524
01:01:45,077 --> 01:01:48,865
Won't the kid get it
right on the head?

525
01:01:49,077 --> 01:01:53,389
Torkild,
what does a horse like that cost?

526
01:01:55,917 --> 01:01:59,546
That's enough, you two!

527
01:02:02,237 --> 01:02:05,468
Good morning.
We're going for a walk on the beach.

528
01:02:05,677 --> 01:02:08,111
Good idea. We'll come too.

529
01:02:08,357 --> 01:02:13,272
You don't have to come.
- We were going that way anyway.

530
01:02:13,437 --> 01:02:19,069
We'll walk on ahead a bit.
You can catch us up if you want.

531
01:02:19,237 --> 01:02:21,546
I'll kill that little bitch.

532
01:02:21,757 --> 01:02:25,875
Hey, language!
- Shut the fuck up.

533
01:02:31,397 --> 01:02:34,434
Look: We've got customers.

534
01:02:34,597 --> 01:02:37,907
- We're not ready.
- Yes we are.

535
01:02:38,077 --> 01:02:41,433
They're our first customers!
Put on a clean shirt.

536
01:02:41,597 --> 01:02:47,433
But who's going to cook?
- Arne, of course. Get going!

537
01:02:50,877 --> 01:02:53,107
Howdy!

538
01:02:54,557 --> 01:02:56,513
A table for two?

539
01:03:00,997 --> 01:03:04,307
Open the register!

540
01:03:04,517 --> 01:03:08,988
Give us the money or ...
I'll hurt you.

541
01:03:09,197 --> 01:03:13,236
Arne, if we keep calm,
it'll be all right.

542
01:03:13,397 --> 01:03:15,706
Relax, it's a robbery.

543
01:03:15,917 --> 01:03:19,227
What's going on here?

544
01:03:30,397 --> 01:03:32,672
Where'd you get that?

545
01:03:32,837 --> 01:03:37,513
Give me that.
Give it here!

546
01:03:37,677 --> 01:03:40,669
Pick them up.
- What?

547
01:03:40,917 --> 01:03:43,875
They're not loaded.
- Don't say that!

548
01:03:44,037 --> 01:03:48,713
Here, take this ...
And get the hell out of here.

549
01:03:53,437 --> 01:03:56,349
Jesus, Arne!

550
01:03:56,557 --> 01:04:01,108
Stop it!
Let go of that fucking glass!

551
01:04:06,797 --> 01:04:11,746
Take him and get out, for chrissakes!

552
01:04:16,037 --> 01:04:19,188
You stop this right now, Torkild!
- Arne, take it easy.

553
01:04:19,357 --> 01:04:23,066
Shut the fuck up!
What the hell's going on?

554
01:04:23,317 --> 01:04:30,075
They just ran off with all our change.
Enough of this fucking shit!

555
01:04:30,317 --> 01:04:33,275
That "fuck" will cost you 50.

556
01:04:33,477 --> 01:04:35,991
Fuck you!

557
01:04:36,677 --> 01:04:39,237
1 00.

558
01:04:39,997 --> 01:04:45,833
I like "Torvald", too.
- So what's wrong with "Torkild"?

559
01:04:46,037 --> 01:04:48,949
It's nearly the same.
- No, it's not!

560
01:04:49,197 --> 01:04:51,347
My granddad's name was Torvald,
not Torkild.

561
01:04:51,597 --> 01:04:53,827
No child of mine is gonna be called ...

562
01:04:58,677 --> 01:05:01,874
Someone's going to break a leg
in this.

563
01:05:07,597 --> 01:05:10,555
What is it?
- Arne's gone.

564
01:05:22,597 --> 01:05:26,670
What happened?
- Some mess, huh?

565
01:05:26,917 --> 01:05:30,387
Whose blood is that?
- Just some customers'.

566
01:05:30,597 --> 01:05:34,067
Is Arne all right?
- Yeah.

567
01:05:34,237 --> 01:05:41,188
How was the beach?
- Customers? Are you all crazy?

568
01:05:41,397 --> 01:05:44,548
They're psychos, Stefan.
- Here, give a hand.

569
01:05:48,517 --> 01:05:50,508
What?

570
01:05:50,677 --> 01:05:55,068
Take it easy, nothing happened.

571
01:06:32,437 --> 01:06:36,430
What are you looking at?

572
01:06:40,317 --> 01:06:43,912
Are you deaf or what?

573
01:06:44,117 --> 01:06:47,587
I said, what are you looking at?

574
01:06:54,197 --> 01:07:00,716
You like staring?
You're so fucking ugly.

575
01:07:00,917 --> 01:07:03,431
Big, fat cow.

576
01:07:09,757 --> 01:07:11,748
Shitty cow.

577
01:07:12,637 --> 01:07:15,709
What the hell are you doing?

578
01:07:22,837 --> 01:07:29,515
Are you shooting my cows?
- Sorry, I didn't know it was yours.

579
01:07:29,677 --> 01:07:32,555
You'll pay for that cow!

580
01:07:32,757 --> 01:07:37,706
What did you shoot it with?
- It's a Desert Eagle.

581
01:07:37,877 --> 01:07:40,914
Israeli Army.

582
01:07:42,477 --> 01:07:44,945
Take it.

583
01:07:53,677 --> 01:07:57,033
She's ... a heavy mother, ain't she?

584
01:07:57,237 --> 01:07:59,831
Biggest handgun ever made.

585
01:08:01,557 --> 01:08:06,677
It's yours. For the cow.

586
01:08:07,997 --> 01:08:12,707
That's a nice shotgun, too.
- It's a Georg Christensen.

587
01:08:12,957 --> 01:08:17,587
It was my dad's.
Want to take a look?

588
01:08:19,477 --> 01:08:21,945
Can I?

589
01:08:36,197 --> 01:08:38,711
Take a look at this.

590
01:09:25,917 --> 01:09:28,636
Arne, Jesus!

591
01:09:28,877 --> 01:09:35,191
What the hell are you doing?
- We're hunting.

592
01:09:35,437 --> 01:09:37,905
Get lost.
I don't need your shit.

593
01:09:39,477 --> 01:09:42,787
He just needs
to get it out of his system.

594
01:09:43,037 --> 01:09:49,715
I'll send him home afterwards.
Don't worry, Torkild.

595
01:09:49,877 --> 01:09:53,711
A buck, Alfred!
- Be seeing you.

596
01:10:04,277 --> 01:10:10,273
Nice place, this.
- It saves going home.

597
01:10:10,437 --> 01:10:16,034
If I stay here, I'm ready to shoot
ducks when the sun comes up.

598
01:10:16,237 --> 01:10:18,831
The ducks come in the morning?
- Yeah.

599
01:10:19,077 --> 01:10:24,197
But you have to be alert,
because they're fast little mothers.

600
01:10:24,397 --> 01:10:29,232
My dad, he could shoot ducks.
Eight or ten at a time.

601
01:10:29,437 --> 01:10:31,905
He must have been good.

602
01:10:32,117 --> 01:10:37,828
If so much as a snail moved,
we'd blow it away.

603
01:10:40,597 --> 01:10:47,036
But then he went off to Thailand and
brought one of those hookers home.

604
01:10:47,277 --> 01:10:51,793
For 1 3 years,
we didn't even shoot a pheasant.

605
01:10:52,037 --> 01:10:56,394
She was vegetarian and Buddhist
and all that crap.

606
01:10:56,597 --> 01:11:00,351
So he was sold on all that.

607
01:11:00,517 --> 01:11:03,953
When he died she went back home,
and I went back to the woods.

608
01:11:05,797 --> 01:11:11,633
But like Carl always says,
it's more fun with two.

609
01:11:11,797 --> 01:11:15,472
Yeah, Carl's always right.
- Don't feel sorry for him.

610
01:11:15,677 --> 01:11:19,590
Believe me, I don't.
- You know he's a liar?

611
01:11:19,797 --> 01:11:25,394
How's that?
- All his stupid stories.

612
01:11:25,637 --> 01:11:30,108
His wife left him so fast
his head spun.

613
01:11:30,357 --> 01:11:34,953
They took his kids
because he beat them.

614
01:11:37,037 --> 01:11:42,157
He hit them?
- You bet he did!

615
01:11:42,317 --> 01:11:49,109
Well, I hit them a few times too,
so he wouldn't feel bad.

616
01:11:49,317 --> 01:11:52,753
He should never have had kids.

617
01:11:54,157 --> 01:11:58,116
You have to have a license,
and papers, -

618
01:11:58,277 --> 01:12:02,714
- and all kinds of shit,
just to buy an air gun, -

619
01:12:02,917 --> 01:12:06,034
- but people can have
as many brats as they want.

620
01:12:06,277 --> 01:12:10,873
It should be the other way around!

621
01:12:14,757 --> 01:12:18,875
What about you guys?
You got families?

622
01:12:19,077 --> 01:12:21,068
No.

623
01:12:25,397 --> 01:12:27,592
You're not really cooks,
are you?

624
01:12:27,797 --> 01:12:34,191
No. We're just in hiding.
But I'm fed up with it.

625
01:12:34,397 --> 01:12:38,231
Did you kill someone?
- Yeah, that too.

626
01:12:42,437 --> 01:12:45,315
Always wanted to try that.

627
01:12:45,517 --> 01:12:52,116
But I've never really had a reason,
so I've stuck to animals.

628
01:12:55,317 --> 01:12:58,673
Are you leaving?
- I don't know.

629
01:12:58,877 --> 01:13:03,473
Torkild just has to be set straight.
It's always been like that.

630
01:13:03,637 --> 01:13:06,026
You boys go back a long way, huh?

631
01:13:08,197 --> 01:13:11,473
Yeah.

632
01:13:28,397 --> 01:13:30,388
Arne?

633
01:13:30,597 --> 01:13:34,306
Come here.

634
01:13:34,557 --> 01:13:37,788
Where do you think you're going?
- Just over to Lars.

635
01:13:37,997 --> 01:13:44,186
Lars? That four-eyed kid?
Aren't they in Sweden?

636
01:13:44,357 --> 01:13:49,067
They let him stay home.
- Come here.

637
01:14:04,477 --> 01:14:07,549
No trouble, okay?
- No. We're just studying.

638
01:14:12,837 --> 01:14:18,070
That's right. If you work hard at
school, you can't go wrong.

639
01:14:18,277 --> 01:14:21,872
Off you go.
- Bye, Dad.

640
01:14:27,317 --> 01:14:33,347
Did you get him?
- I think so. Go see.

641
01:14:33,557 --> 01:14:37,311
We'd best be getting back.
You've tried it now.

642
01:14:37,517 --> 01:14:41,954
It's your turn now.
- I don't want to.

643
01:14:45,477 --> 01:14:48,150
Do it!
- I don't want to.

644
01:14:48,357 --> 01:14:52,794
You want more?
- No.

645
01:15:31,637 --> 01:15:33,628
They're only pellets.

646
01:15:35,397 --> 01:15:39,470
Take it easy,
they're just pellets!

647
01:15:40,797 --> 01:15:43,675
Look, it's nothing.

648
01:16:22,837 --> 01:16:26,716
Let's go for a walk.
- Wait a bit, okay?

649
01:16:26,877 --> 01:16:31,234
Why do we have to stay here?
Arne left, why not you?

650
01:16:31,437 --> 01:16:34,474
But he's coming back.

651
01:16:41,077 --> 01:16:46,595
This is so boring. The first
episodes are much better.

652
01:16:46,797 --> 01:16:51,154
Can't we go down to the beach?
- Then do it on your own!

653
01:16:51,357 --> 01:16:54,793
You can't talk to me like that!
- Idiot.

654
01:16:54,997 --> 01:16:59,593
Did you hear what he said to me?
- Oh, shut up.

655
01:17:03,517 --> 01:17:06,077
There he is.

656
01:17:19,917 --> 01:17:21,908
Howdy!

657
01:17:22,117 --> 01:17:24,631
Hi, Arne.

658
01:17:45,637 --> 01:17:51,553
I shot twelve ducks, Torkild.
Alfred says he's never seen anything like it.

659
01:17:53,237 --> 01:17:58,357
Twelve in one shot!
- That's great, Arne.

660
01:18:00,837 --> 01:18:05,228
Where's your bag?
- I gave it to Alfred.

661
01:18:05,477 --> 01:18:10,790
And he gave you the shotgun?
- Yeah. We swapped.

662
01:18:13,557 --> 01:18:19,268
Well, what the hell.
I suppose one shotgun's okay.

663
01:18:19,477 --> 01:18:25,712
Lots of folks have them. But
don't let the customers see it, okay?

664
01:18:30,077 --> 01:18:35,105
There aren't going to be
any customers, Torkild.

665
01:18:35,277 --> 01:18:41,034
You can't just open a restaurant
in the middle of the woods.

666
01:18:41,197 --> 01:18:43,188
Want to see a fox?

667
01:18:44,077 --> 01:18:46,910
Hi, Arne.
Torkild ..?

668
01:18:47,117 --> 01:18:50,996
It's just that Hanne ...
- We'll all take a walk now.

669
01:18:51,157 --> 01:18:55,150
We're all here, so we can
go down to the beach. Together.

670
01:18:55,877 --> 01:18:57,833
Let's go ...

671
01:19:34,077 --> 01:19:37,387
I'll give you the rest of the money
if you drown her.

672
01:19:37,597 --> 01:19:41,192
Now, now. Show a little tolerance.

673
01:19:43,277 --> 01:19:46,747
Look how happy he is.

674
01:19:46,997 --> 01:19:52,355
What the hell's going on?
You sound like a bunch of faggots.

675
01:19:52,557 --> 01:19:56,266
Give her a chance.

676
01:19:56,477 --> 01:19:58,672
Are you feeling all right?

677
01:20:01,597 --> 01:20:04,430
Yeah, I'm fine.

678
01:20:09,597 --> 01:20:16,435
Look, they're not so bad.
- They're nuts, can't you see?

679
01:20:16,637 --> 01:20:22,712
They're a bunch of psychopaths.
We can't stay here.

680
01:20:22,917 --> 01:20:27,866
They're all right.
You just have to get to know them.

681
01:20:28,117 --> 01:20:33,987
How? All you do is drink and hunt
and watch television.

682
01:20:34,157 --> 01:20:40,551
Then let's do something else.
What do you want to do?

683
01:20:43,797 --> 01:20:48,825
What is it?
- I feel like blowing eggs.

684
01:20:49,037 --> 01:20:52,950
What?
- I want to blow eggs.

685
01:21:14,437 --> 01:21:16,997
Your turn, Stefan.

686
01:21:22,037 --> 01:21:25,234
Isn't this fun?
- Yeah ...

687
01:21:26,677 --> 01:21:30,192
Did you blow eggs, too,
when you were kids?

688
01:21:33,997 --> 01:21:35,953
Yeah, I did.

689
01:21:36,117 --> 01:21:41,555
Every Easter, we used to blow forty
eggs until we were red in the face.

690
01:21:41,757 --> 01:21:45,386
It was real fun.

691
01:21:45,597 --> 01:21:51,308
Did you guys have animals, too,
when you were kids?

692
01:21:51,517 --> 01:21:53,667
Let's just do the eggs.

693
01:21:53,877 --> 01:21:56,869
Your turn, Torkild.

694
01:21:57,077 --> 01:22:03,073
I don't want to.
- Come on, everyone else did one!

695
01:22:03,237 --> 01:22:06,832
If he doesn't want to, then ...

696
01:22:12,637 --> 01:22:15,549
Okay, I'll blow one.

697
01:22:27,437 --> 01:22:30,634
Nothing's happening, Torkild!

698
01:22:33,517 --> 01:22:38,466
You're doing it all wrong, Torkild.

699
01:22:40,877 --> 01:22:43,869
Torkild, you're doing it all wrong.

700
01:22:45,517 --> 01:22:48,429
Torkild, you haven't got a clue.

701
01:22:48,637 --> 01:22:54,667
Let him try.
- I've never seen anyone worse at it.

702
01:22:54,877 --> 01:22:57,311
Here, let me show you.

703
01:22:57,557 --> 01:23:00,196
Wait, Stefan.
Torkild, if you just ...

704
01:23:00,397 --> 01:23:03,833
Shut the fuck up, bitch!

705
01:23:07,317 --> 01:23:10,514
There's something wrong
with that egg.

706
01:23:10,717 --> 01:23:16,508
Stefan, get her out of here.
- Come on, honey ...

707
01:23:19,557 --> 01:23:21,787
What happened?

708
01:23:26,437 --> 01:23:31,431
Look at that, the shell's all wrong.
It wasn't you, Torkild.

709
01:23:31,637 --> 01:23:34,834
Yeah. It must have been a sick hen.

710
01:23:37,117 --> 01:23:42,032
Yeah, the shell looks weird.
- Sure, just forget it.

711
01:24:02,037 --> 01:24:03,948
Drive!

712
01:24:04,197 --> 01:24:08,987
Maybe I should say goodbye?
- No. Then we won't get the van.

713
01:24:09,157 --> 01:24:13,355
It's Torkild's van.
- You don't owe him anything.

714
01:24:13,557 --> 01:24:16,230
He owes you money, right?
- Yes, but ...

715
01:24:16,477 --> 01:24:19,071
Then drive!

716
01:24:20,037 --> 01:24:22,232
Come on, Stefan!
- Okay.

717
01:24:49,197 --> 01:24:52,155
Dagur ...
- I'm playing billiards.

718
01:24:52,357 --> 01:24:55,554
Just listen to this.

719
01:25:01,077 --> 01:25:05,593
Are you guys related or what?

720
01:25:18,317 --> 01:25:23,107
What is this childish crap?
Why won't he come back?

721
01:25:23,317 --> 01:25:28,630
Sit down and watch this.
- I've seen it 20 times.

722
01:25:28,837 --> 01:25:31,431
It's no fun anymore.

723
01:25:34,477 --> 01:25:37,867
How about a card game?
- I'm going to bed.

724
01:25:38,077 --> 01:25:41,069
To bed?
- Alfred's coming tomorrow morning.

725
01:25:41,277 --> 01:25:47,113
You could stay up for a bit. What if
Stefan comes back? Or customers?

726
01:25:47,357 --> 01:25:54,035
Listen, there won't be any customers.
If there are, wake me up. Good night.

727
01:26:02,317 --> 01:26:09,109
What if he doesn't come back?
- Good night, Torkild.

728
01:26:24,757 --> 01:26:27,191
They want to know
if we've got fireworks.

729
01:26:52,877 --> 01:26:55,949
So, Stefan.
Open Granddad's present.

730
01:26:58,717 --> 01:27:02,630
Oh, my!
- Thanks, Granddad.

731
01:27:02,837 --> 01:27:06,273
It's from Grandma, too.
Not that you care.

732
01:27:07,517 --> 01:27:11,476
Eat properly, Stefan!
Small bites.

733
01:27:11,677 --> 01:27:14,874
You don't care that Grandma
is full of cancer, do you?

734
01:27:15,117 --> 01:27:18,746
Yes, I do.
- How often have you visited her?

735
01:27:18,917 --> 01:27:23,229
Once! One lousy visit from you
in two weeks.

736
01:27:23,437 --> 01:27:28,557
You'll be sorry when she's gone.

737
01:27:32,317 --> 01:27:37,949
When I went blind, they told me my
other senses would be enhanced.

738
01:27:38,157 --> 01:27:41,035
But I've just had these damn colds
all the time.

739
01:27:42,917 --> 01:27:46,387
Stefan,
today you become an adult.

740
01:27:46,557 --> 01:27:52,905
So let me tell you what my father
told me when I was confirmed:

741
01:27:53,117 --> 01:27:56,712
Never forget your family!

742
01:27:56,957 --> 01:28:00,393
No matter what happens,
never forget your family.

743
01:28:00,597 --> 01:28:06,467
Just look at Susanne and ...
- Anders.

744
01:28:06,637 --> 01:28:09,435
Anders. Susanne and Anders.

745
01:28:09,597 --> 01:28:13,351
We all know what you went through
with your little boy.

746
01:28:13,557 --> 01:28:18,915
The Lord took him.
But did you give up? No!

747
01:28:19,117 --> 01:28:23,395
You kept on going,
because you had your family.

748
01:28:27,277 --> 01:28:30,189
Stop that!
- What happened?

749
01:28:32,757 --> 01:28:37,547
Nothing.
- Was I snoring?

750
01:28:37,757 --> 01:28:40,874
It's okay.
- You get used to it.

751
01:28:41,117 --> 01:28:46,145
Just wait till you meet Uncle Sven,
he nearly choked on his own snot.

752
01:28:46,397 --> 01:28:49,355
I hope they come to the christening.

753
01:28:51,557 --> 01:28:55,596
They're looking forward to seeing you.
- You said that.

754
01:28:55,837 --> 01:29:01,275
I'm sure they'll like you. And you
have to meet Rolf and Marianne.

755
01:29:01,437 --> 01:29:06,636
They've had three kids
with water on the brain, imagine!

756
01:29:06,877 --> 01:29:12,509
The essence of all this is ...

757
01:29:12,717 --> 01:29:18,986
... no matter what happens,
you've got your family.

758
01:29:19,237 --> 01:29:23,071
Rely on them,
and there's nothing you can't do.

759
01:29:23,277 --> 01:29:26,428
Cheers, my boy,
and don't forget that.

760
01:29:26,637 --> 01:29:29,026
Why can't you behave!

761
01:29:29,237 --> 01:29:31,273
Look at that ...

762
01:29:32,797 --> 01:29:36,585
I knew it!
I knew it would happen.

763
01:29:38,397 --> 01:29:40,308
I'm bleeding.

764
01:29:40,557 --> 01:29:42,912
I'm bleeding!

765
01:29:43,117 --> 01:29:45,347
Not again!

766
01:29:45,517 --> 01:29:48,395
No, don't lie on the carpet!

767
01:29:48,597 --> 01:29:51,430
You can't get blood off.

768
01:29:51,677 --> 01:29:54,874
I don't want to lose it, Mom!
- Come out here on the floor.

769
01:29:55,077 --> 01:29:59,992
Come on.
- What the hell's going on?

770
01:30:00,197 --> 01:30:02,665
What the hell's going on?

771
01:31:48,437 --> 01:31:50,348
Evening!

772
01:31:50,557 --> 01:31:55,392
There's a fucking restaurant
here somewhere.

773
01:31:55,637 --> 01:32:00,108
It's in the woods.
- I know, that's what they all say.

774
01:32:00,317 --> 01:32:03,673
We've been looking for it
for a fucking day and a half.

775
01:32:03,877 --> 01:32:06,152
Watch your mouth, son!

776
01:32:12,997 --> 01:32:17,354
Let me go.
- Show me where it is!

777
01:32:17,517 --> 01:32:21,226
It's here.

778
01:32:21,477 --> 01:32:23,991
Thank you!

779
01:32:47,277 --> 01:32:51,429
Any customers?
- Sure, they all went for a piss.

780
01:32:51,597 --> 01:32:54,907
What about Carl?
- Not yet.

781
01:33:08,557 --> 01:33:12,106
I think we should go.
- What?

782
01:33:12,277 --> 01:33:16,156
We could drive south.

783
01:33:25,757 --> 01:33:28,794
It's empty, Torkild.
And you owe us a lot of dough.

784
01:33:29,037 --> 01:33:35,033
We'll rob a couple of gas stations
on the way to Barcelona.

785
01:33:35,197 --> 01:33:39,748
You can get some coke, Peter.
And you can get guns, Arne.

786
01:33:39,917 --> 01:33:43,307
I'm going hunting tomorrow.

787
01:33:43,477 --> 01:33:45,468
Get over there!

788
01:33:48,597 --> 01:33:53,307
Take their guns.

789
01:33:57,757 --> 01:34:01,875
Why the fuck did you do this, Torkild?

790
01:34:02,077 --> 01:34:04,591
They're clean.

791
01:34:08,957 --> 01:34:12,029
Have you guys hung up your guns?

792
01:34:12,237 --> 01:34:17,709
It's a trick.
You know I won't shoot unarmed men.

793
01:34:18,557 --> 01:34:21,071
But it won't work.

794
01:34:24,477 --> 01:34:28,755
Here you are ...

795
01:34:32,397 --> 01:34:34,433
Now it's a fair fight.

796
01:34:40,837 --> 01:34:42,907
Stay where you are.

797
01:34:57,757 --> 01:34:59,748
Howdy.

798
01:34:59,957 --> 01:35:04,269
Stefan?
- Hi, Torkild. Arne ... Peter.

799
01:35:04,517 --> 01:35:09,386
But why?
- It didn't work out.

800
01:35:26,517 --> 01:35:28,473
What about Hanne?

801
01:35:28,717 --> 01:35:32,426
Well ...
She cried a bit.

802
01:35:35,277 --> 01:35:39,065
And then she yelled a bit.

803
01:35:42,597 --> 01:35:47,227
Sorry about this, boys.

804
01:35:47,477 --> 01:35:50,435
That's all right, Torkild.
- Shut up!

805
01:35:50,637 --> 01:35:53,947
What is it with you guys?
Are you faggots or what?

806
01:35:54,157 --> 01:36:01,871
Why am I always left out?
You think you're better than me?

807
01:36:02,077 --> 01:36:05,387
Give me the money
so you can die quickly.

808
01:36:05,597 --> 01:36:08,794
It's all gone.
- Don't lie! Where is it?

809
01:36:08,957 --> 01:36:12,632
It's true, it's gone.

810
01:36:12,837 --> 01:36:18,434
We bought this restaurant.
- A restaurant?

811
01:36:23,677 --> 01:36:26,271
But why, Torkild?

812
01:36:28,717 --> 01:36:30,992
Because I wanted my own place.

813
01:36:33,917 --> 01:36:36,511
There he is!

814
01:37:33,517 --> 01:37:35,587
Alfred, for chrissakes, they're dead!

815
01:37:48,197 --> 01:37:52,793
Easy, Alfred.
It's over.

816
01:37:53,037 --> 01:37:57,030
Easy, now ...

817
01:38:18,997 --> 01:38:22,785
So that was three roast pork
and one stewed cabbage?

818
01:38:22,997 --> 01:38:25,192
He met his end right there.

819
01:38:25,437 --> 01:38:29,146
Weren't you scared?
- Yes. It was frightening.

820
01:38:29,357 --> 01:38:32,394
And he was an Eskimo?
- Carl thought he was.

821
01:38:32,597 --> 01:38:36,192
But he was actually Norwegian.
- Who's Carl?

822
01:38:36,437 --> 01:38:40,191
The guy sitting at the bar
with Alfred.

823
01:38:40,357 --> 01:38:44,953
He met his match in those two.
Can I show you to your table?

824
01:38:45,157 --> 01:38:48,866
Just sit down,
I'll be there in a moment.

825
01:38:50,437 --> 01:38:53,747
Two more, please.

826
01:38:53,917 --> 01:38:57,307
And one for me, too.
- In just a moment.

827
01:39:14,397 --> 01:39:17,753
Hi, Torkild.
- Hi.

828
01:39:19,717 --> 01:39:23,153
This is Flemming.
- Hi.

829
01:39:23,317 --> 01:39:25,990
Hello.
- Hello.

830
01:39:28,997 --> 01:39:33,991
Is this the ... him?
- It's him.

831
01:39:36,477 --> 01:39:39,549
So this is your place?
- Yes, it is.

832
01:39:41,597 --> 01:39:47,035
Would you like to sit down?
- Yes, thank you.

833
01:39:50,797 --> 01:39:54,915
Anything you like. On the house.
- You don't need to do that.

834
01:39:55,077 --> 01:39:58,672
The paper's paying.

835
01:39:58,917 --> 01:40:03,308
But don't give us anything special.
- Of course.

836
01:40:03,557 --> 01:40:06,867
This looks disgusting ...

837
01:40:12,757 --> 01:40:14,713
You know who's in there?

838
01:40:14,957 --> 01:40:19,747
Yeah, she looks a lot nicer now.
- No, she doesn't.

839
01:40:19,917 --> 01:40:22,715
She does, Torkild.
- She's blossomed.

840
01:40:22,877 --> 01:40:26,836
He must be well-hung.
- Shut up. Peter, get our best wine.

841
01:40:26,997 --> 01:40:30,831
It's gone.
- It can't be. What's in the holes?

842
01:40:31,037 --> 01:40:34,347
Beer.

843
01:40:34,557 --> 01:40:36,707
Please, help me.

844
01:40:39,797 --> 01:40:44,075
Just do this for me, and
I'll never ask for another favour.

845
01:40:46,757 --> 01:40:51,592
We can't make gourmet food.
- It doesn't matter, just do your best!

846
01:40:51,837 --> 01:40:54,795
That's all that matters, right?

847
01:41:06,437 --> 01:41:12,706
Torkild, you shouldn't have.
- Today's menu. Same for everyone.

848
01:41:25,637 --> 01:41:30,665
I've visited more restaurants
than most people do in a lifetime, -

849
01:41:30,917 --> 01:41:35,991
- but the meal I had
at the Flickering Lanterns, -

850
01:41:36,197 --> 01:41:39,872
- was the worst
I've ever experienced.

851
01:41:41,117 --> 01:41:44,029
But despite the unhygienic tableware -

852
01:41:44,237 --> 01:41:48,549
- and the overcooked,
half-peeled potatoes, -

853
01:41:48,757 --> 01:41:52,272
- I'm giving them four stars anyway.

854
01:41:52,437 --> 01:41:56,988
One for Stefan, one for Peter, -

855
01:41:57,157 --> 01:42:02,277
- one for Arne,
and one for Torkild.
