00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:08,080
Valhalla, this is Thor.
Valhalla, this is Thor.

2
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:11,360
<i>We have visual on
a possible high-value target.</i>

3
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:12,880
Thor, this is Valhalla.

4
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,240
We're seeking positive ID
on target traveling in convoy

5
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:19,320
and we're pushing
more assets your way.

6
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:22,480
Contact Loki on secondary net.

7
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,400
Loki, this is Thor.

8
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:28,520
<i>Target is located at grid coordinates
two-four-Tango-Kilo-Bravo</i>

9
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:31,800
<i>one-two-four-five-six-seven-three-niner.</i>

10
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:33,520
<i>Confirm you have visual.</i>

11
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:34,960
Verifying target ID.

12
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:36,960
Electro-optic and
infrared sensors are online.

13
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:39,440
- Confirming target.
- SecDef is arriving now.

14
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:50,560
Mr. Secretary, this way, sir.

15
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:56,320
Attempting cell phone link
to moving target.

16
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:58,160
Stand by for data feed.

17
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:02,280
Stand by for audio.

18
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:03,520
Got it.

19
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:08,720
Now, don't tell me you spotted the beard
in the middle of a goddamn sandstorm.

20
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:11,880
- Is it really him?
- We're confirming that now, sir.

21
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:13,000
Sir, audio is coming up now.

22
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:16,080
- Verifying voice pattern match.
- What do we have here, Sergeant?

23
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:20,400
Four males. One of them is speaking
in a Rakhshani dialect,

24
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:23,000
consistent with our intel on al-Khoei.

25
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:27,200
Sir, it's just coming up.

26
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:30,680
"Thirty-seven percent" and "probable"
don't belong in the same sentence.

27
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:32,200
I'm not taking this to the President.

28
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:35,280
<i>CIA and NCTC concur it is the target,</i>

29
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,080
<i>based on reliable intel from the Brits.</i>

30
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,400
They're pulling off the highway.

31
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,280
Criteria is not met. Recommend abort.

32
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:58,080
We have an abort recommendation.

33
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:01,840
If it's him, this guy comes out of hiding
every couple of years at best.

34
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:04,240
Sir, target is appearing
around the northeast corner.

35
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:10,960
We've got AK-47 s,
RPGs and Chaparral guided missiles.

36
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,760
This is a training camp, Mr. Secretary.

37
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:16,040
- Wait. Wait. Print. 51%.
- 51%.

38
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:18,920
- Abort rec still holds.
- All other PID options exhausted.

39
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,200
What do you suggest we do, sir?

40
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:24,560
Is that a weapons cache?

41
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,560
Sir, the placement of
the stones around the pit,

42
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:30,040
marker for the five pillars of Islam.
I think it's a funeral.

43
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:31,480
For Christ's sake.

44
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:35,480
Counsel, how many ways would this
violate the Geneva Convention?

45
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:37,400
<i>We can invoke hors de combat.</i>

46
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:40,400
There's no independent intel verifying
that this is, in fact, a funeral.

47
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:43,560
Signal's got the President
from Air Force One, sir.

48
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:52,960
Mr. President,

49
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:56,680
we have a 51% identity match
on Majid al-Khoei.

50
00:03:56,800 --> 00:04:00,160
<i>The bad news is, there's
some possibility he's at a funeral.</i>

51
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:03,800
You should also be aware
we have an abort recommendation.

52
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:06,360
But the Joint Chiefs are urging a go.

53
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:09,640
<i>All right, what's your recommendation?</i>

54
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,320
Sir, we measure success by
the least amount of collateral damage.

55
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,200
At 51% probability, the risk is too high.

56
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:29,680
<i>And if it is al-Khoei and he walks,
I'm putting our people at risk.</i>

57
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:32,080
<i>You have a go.</i>

58
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,640
Thank you, Mr. President.

59
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,400
- We're weapons hot!
- We have weapons hot!

60
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:45,800
- Loki, you are cleared to engage.
- Repeat, weapons hot. PID.

61
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:49,160
We have handshake with the
MQ9 Reaper. Sending you images now.

62
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:52,520
- Loki, target coordinates received.
- Yes, sir. Switching to IR sensor.

63
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:02,960
Target is lased.

64
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,520
Master arm on.

65
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,040
Missiles away.

66
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,800
Ten seconds to impact.

67
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:37,960
You got to make a choice, fellas.

68
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:42,360
Who are you going to be? Boys or men?

69
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:47,080
- I'm out on this one.
- Why?

70
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:49,360
- 'Cause I'm broke.
- Come...

71
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:51,120
How do I know you don't have
something great under there?

72
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:52,560
Kwame just paired the board.
I'm floating on the river here.

73
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:53,680
Look at the table.

74
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:56,480
I don't know. I'm supposed to take my
girl out later. It's a lot of money.

75
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:59,640
Your girl out? Who's that?

76
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:01,160
- Elaine?
- Yeah.

77
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:03,200
You guys have been going out
for a while.

78
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:04,640
How long?

79
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,920
- Couple months.
- Couple months? Wow.

80
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:10,080
- That's big. You have sex with her yet?
- Kinda.

81
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:11,440
- What the hell is "kinda"?
- "Kinda"?

82
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:12,680
- Personal question.
- Okay, well, listen.

83
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:15,000
Let me ask you a question.
What are you going to do tonight?

84
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:16,040
Fish filet and a Coke?

85
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:17,680
Go to Blockbuster,
rent a little romantic comedy,

86
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:19,400
go back to Mom's house,
sit on the couch?

87
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:20,720
- How'd you know?
- Well, that's what you do.

88
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:22,480
You're a dependable person.
That's what you're going to do.

89
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,080
You know what you should do?

90
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:26,400
You need to lay down some real green
and treat your lady right.

91
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:28,200
You know, you need to take her
to a nice place.

92
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:31,400
Red Lobster. Olive Garden.
Tablecloths. Soft music.

93
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:33,400
And then you skip
this Blockbuster thing.

94
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:36,280
Girls want to go out. Especially a girl
as cute as your girl, you know?

95
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:38,400
She wants to be seen.
That's why she dresses up.

96
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:39,920
So you take her to the movies.

97
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,440
- A little popcorn-drink combo.
- True. True.

98
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:44,440
Elaine might want a hot dog and some
nachos, so you shell out for that, too.

99
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:45,880
And then before you know it,

100
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:47,120
she's cozying up
the way she never would've

101
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:48,280
at her mom's house, you know?

102
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:49,720
- Preach it. Preach it.
- Now all of a sudden, look.

103
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:52,080
Gino Romero's walking tall
with Elaine yank-my-Dickinson,

104
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:54,000
- all because he dared to dream tonight.
- Yes! Yes! Yes!

105
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,280
And he became a man.
And that's the choice.

106
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:56,800
- Yes.
- And that's what's on the table.

107
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:59,200
This is the dream right here.

108
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:00,640
Are you a man?

109
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:01,880
- I'm with you.
- Okay, here we go.

110
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:03,120
- I'm with you. Twenty?
- Twenty.

111
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:04,680
Big boy game.

112
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:06,280
Call.

113
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,960
- Cowboys over aces, big Jer.
- Wow. Wow.

114
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:10,520
- Didn't see that coming, huh?
- Yeah, that's a tough one.

115
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:12,640
This is a tough one, too.
Four bullets, baby.

116
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:15,320
Get out of here!
You baited me into that, Jer. Come on!

117
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:17,320
- That's the way it goes.
- So what happened to Red Lobster?

118
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:18,960
No, I guess it's Mama's house
for you tonight.

119
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:20,280
But look, I saved you 40 bucks.

120
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:23,640
And now Elaine won't have to shell out
for herpes medication.

121
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:26,040
Break's over, bitches.
Freitag missed his shift again.

122
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,200
- Someone's on collator duty.
- Great.

123
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,120
All right, well, gentlemen,

124
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:31,880
I'll give you a chance to win some of
this back tomorrow. Enjoy yourselves.

125
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:33,440
All right, man.

126
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:41,120
Hey there. Welcome to Copy Cabana.
How can I help you?

127
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:43,320
I couldn't get the machine
past the main menu.

128
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:44,960
- That machine there?
- Yeah.

129
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:46,960
Did you swipe your credit card
to the left, sir?

130
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:48,760
- Didn't do that.
- Well, that's your problem.

131
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:49,840
Why don't you try it again?

132
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:01,840
<i>Cell phone users, beware.</i>

133
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:05,960
<i>The Federal Bureau of Investigation

<i>Watch your step, please.</i>

141
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:29,240
Did you drop this?

142
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:32,120
Yes.

143
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:36,240

145
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:40,680
Come on, come on, come on.

146
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:23,720
Jerry?

147
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:27,560
Mrs. Wierzbowski! I was just...
I thought you might have been sleeping.

148
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:29,000
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- So... But I have...

149
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:30,840
I have some rent here.

150
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:32,920
- Here you go.
- Yeah, some is good. All is better.

151
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,840
Well, that's most of it. Here.

152
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:36,200
$1, $1, $1...

153
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:37,840
No, no, no. Look. Here's a five there.

154
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,920
- Five.
- Yeah.

155
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:41,960
Where is girl? I don't see her no more.

156
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:44,240
You know you're the only woman for me.

157
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:46,080
No, that's done. She got smart.

158
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:48,000
- Like the others.
- Yeah. Yeah.

159
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:52,480
Is woman friend? Answer.
Then see if she give you money for rent.

160
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:55,200
One second.

161
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:58,640
Hey, Mom.

162
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:02,480
What?

163
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:31,040
- Looks just like him.
- I'm not him.

164
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:09,560
Six months without a boo or a bah, huh?

165
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:11,000
Yes, sir.

166
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:13,200
So where were you this time?

167
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:18,760
Alaska. Singapore.
I got a job there.

168
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:25,640
I... I spoke to Stanford.

169
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:26,720
I pulled some strings.

170
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,520
They said they'd take you back.
Even though you took off...

171
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:29,760
Two years ago, Dad.

172
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:33,320
Jerry, you know, it wouldn't kill you
to ask for help once in a while.

173
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:34,680
You want to have
this conversation now?

174
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:35,800
- It's Stanford!
- You want to do this today.

175
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:36,880
You know how many people would kill...

176
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:39,080
- Today? You want to have this now?
- Fine.

177
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:42,240
You do whatever you want.
You always have.

178
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:52,680
You know, I keep thinking,
I'm going to walk in here one day

179
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:57,200
and I'm not going to feel
like a stranger in my own house.

180
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:09,880
I don't want your money.

181
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:38,720
<i>Can I have your attention, please?</i>

182
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:42,960
<i>Smoking is not permitted on the train.
Chicago is next.</i>

183
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:04,640
Can't find the keys
and he's late as usual.

184
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:07,600
- I'm going to have to take you.
- He'll be here.

185
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,400
All right, wait five more minutes.

186
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:12,400
Help me out here.
We came home last night.

187
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:15,280
I put the leftovers down.
You turned on the TV. I went over,

188
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:18,840
said, "No TV, no TV, no TV."
Turned it off.

189
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:19,960
Came over here.

190
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:22,000
- Checked the messages.
- Knocked over the phone.

191
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:24,400
Right, knocked over the phone.
Put it back.

192
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:26,680
Put the leftovers in the fridge.

193
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:31,400
Let's go!

194
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:33,680
I put vitamins in your toiletry bag.
Don't forget to take...

195
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:35,400
- Two in the morning and two at night.
- That's right.

196
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:36,360
And your inhaler's
in the back of your bag.

197
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:37,520
- Sammy!
- Daddy!

198
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:40,120
Come here. You didn't think
I'd miss the big send-off, do you, huh?

199
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:41,440
Let's get you on this train.

200
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:43,080
- This must be your...
- Trumpet.

201
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:45,080
My God, this weighs, like, 200 pounds.
You carry this yourself?

202
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:46,840
- Mr. and Mrs. Holloman!
- Miss.

203
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:48,440
- You just made it.
- Right.

204
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:49,880
- Here, Sam.
- Thanks.

205
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:50,960
- Listen to me.
- I have one more here.

206
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:53,720
All these other kids, right? They're
going to call their moms, too, all right?

207
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:55,440
They're just going to lie about it.

208
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:58,320
All right, and eat junk food 'cause this is
your one chance, but brush your teeth.

209
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:01,480
Mom, you got to stop.
I'm going to miss you, too.

210
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,120
<i>Capitol Limited to D.C. is
departing now.</i>

211
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:04,280
Give me a hug.

212
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:05,320
<i>All aboard.</i>

213
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:07,360
- I love you so much.
- I love you, too.

214
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:10,800
- Shine bright, okay?
- Okay.

215
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:13,760
Rock the house, buddy.
You're going to be great. Okay?

216
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:15,120
- Okay.
- I'll see you later.

217
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:17,720
- Bye!
- Have fun in D.C.!

218
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:20,400
- Bye, Mom!
- Your mom going to be okay?

219
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:21,840
It's unclear.

220
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,040
I'm so sorry. I got stuck in traffic,

221
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:26,160
- and I didn't even...
- Don't even say it.

222
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:29,680
All aboard!

223
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:32,000
Yes. Five-nine-one-three.

224
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:39,680
It's here. It's here.

225
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:43,200
Okay, okay.

226
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:00,960
- Come on!
- Two seconds. Sorry.

227
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:09,480
No, wait.

228
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:19,640
- Hey, hang on a second.
- Sorry.

229
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:20,920
- You're dropping money.
- Sir, sir!

230
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,680
Big date, you know?
Fingers crossed, huh?

231
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:28,760
- Here you go. Have a good day!
- Thank you.

232
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:33,080
- Jerry!
- What?

233
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,920
- So many boxes.
- Boxes?

234
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:37,400
I had to open your room.
All day they come.

235
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:38,840
- Big boxes, small boxes.
- My boxes?

236
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:40,280
I don't know.
Whose boxes would they be?

237
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:42,600
- All right, okay.
- Look at them there. See in there?

238
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:44,000
- See, I put them all...
- Yeah. Yeah.

239
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:45,840
- Listen, I have something for you here.
- Yeah.

240
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:47,840
This is rent for this month
and next month, too, okay?

241
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:49,600
- Oh, my.
- Thank you.

242
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:01,120
Hello?

243
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:03,720
<i>The FBI will arrive
at your apartment in 30 seconds.</i>

244
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:05,360
<i>You must flee the premises.</i>

245
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:06,600
Who... Who is this?

246
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:08,120
<i>You've been activated, Jerry.</i>

247
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:10,040
<i>- Who the hell is this?
- Your compliance is vital.</i>

248
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:11,080
How did you get this number?

249
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:13,960
<i>You now have 24 seconds.
Leave your residence.</i>

250
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:17,440
<i>Your destination, the Mathis train
station. We will guide you from there.</i>

251
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:18,480
What is this?

252
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:20,680
<i>The evidence in your
apartment is irrefutable.</i>

253
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:21,760
<i>- Listen.
- 17 seconds.</i>

254
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:22,800
I'm going to hang this phone up now.

255
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:24,040
<i>They'll seek your arrest
for conspiracy, treason...</i>

256
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:26,160
<i>- I'm hanging this phone up now!
- ... violating state and local law.</i>

257
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:27,960
<i>- You tell me how you got this number!
- Maximum penalty, death.</i>

258
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:30,000
No, none of this is mine!

259
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,160
FBI, FBI, FBI! Get down on the floor!

260
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,880
Get on the ground!

261
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:39,680
Down now! Get down!

262
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:42,000
- I didn't do anything!
- Get down!

263
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:43,120
- Listen!
- Don't move.

264
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:45,520
It's not mine! It's not mine!

265
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:58,480
This is obviously
some sort of mistake, right?

266
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:01,360
I mean, I don't know
what I'm doing in this room, sir.

267
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,360
It's cold as hell outside.

268
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:07,600
- You draw?
- I what?

269
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:11,120
Do you draw? Do you sketch?
You have ink all over your fingers.

270
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:14,800
Look, you know you got
the wrong guy, right?

271
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:16,120
I mean,
this is all some kind of sick joke.

272
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:18,320
- I don't know what I'm doing here.
- Obviously.

273
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:21,320
Obviously you have
nothing to do with it, yeah.

274
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:23,880
Did you love your brother?

275
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:27,720
Or did you hate him?
Did you admire him?

276
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:32,320
Was your brother patriotic,
would you say?

277
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:37,600
When's the last time you saw him?

278
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:41,440
- Christmas.
- This past Christmas?

279
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:45,760
- Three Christmases ago.
- Three years, huh?

280
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:49,320
Well, the phone records show that you
haven't even called him in over a year.

281
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:52,080
So no text messages?
No smoke signals?

282
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:53,640
No MySpace or Facebook messages?

283
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:55,160
Yeah, so what are you trying to say?
We're not...

284
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:56,400
Are you asking if we're the type of twins

285
00:19:56,480 --> 00:20:00,800
that wear the same shirt to the mall,
hold hands, and things like that? No.

286
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,800
- Sir, I don't even know your name.
- I'm sorry, that was rude of me.

287
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:05,040
I'm Tom Morgan,

288
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:08,400
the Supervising Agent assigned
to the Joint Terrorism Task Force.

289
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:13,000
You think I'm a terrorist?

290
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:15,200
No, you're a copy boy, aren't you?

291
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:17,800
- I'm a copy associate.
- Copy associate.

292
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:19,720
But your brother,

293
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:23,840
it says here he was a little more,
I guess you'd say, ambitious than you.

294
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:25,960
Graduated from
the Air Force Academy at 21,

295
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:29,600
with an advanced degree in parallel
algorithms and quantum electronics.

296
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:31,800
I don't even know what the hell
that stuff means. Do you?

297
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:34,280
Cadet wing commander, valedictorian,
plum job in the Public Affairs...

298
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,000
Yeah, no, I know what he did, sir.

299
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:37,560
Why'd you drop out of school, Jerry?

300
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:39,840
Did your brother have
any influence on that decision?

301
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:41,280
No, school just wasn't for me.

302
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:43,680
No, I mean, who would want
a Stanford education anyway?

303
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:46,640
More upward mobility
at Copy Cabana, I guess, right?

304
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:50,680
I see you did a little backpacking.
Singapore, Bali, Indonesia.

305
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:52,040
Did odd jobs here and there.
So you've been around.

306
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:53,160
Look, none of this has anything to do

307
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:55,280
with any of the shit
that was in my apartment.

308
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:57,400
Why would I send it to myself?
My name is on the lease.

309
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:59,600
I'd have to be the dumbest terrorist
in the history of the world.

310
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:01,040
So who deposited the 750?

311
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:04,320
The...
I don't know who deposited the 750!

312
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:05,640
God maybe? I thought it was a miracle,

313
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:07,840
I took the money. That was my mistake.
It was an accident.

314
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:09,560
Do accidents not happen
in your universe?

315
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:13,520
Well, the money originated
from the YTBC Bank of...

316
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:15,440
Well, I'll be darned, Singapore.

317
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:18,320
Opened with a transfer from
a corporation called The Star of Orion,

318
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:20,520
- a dummy front for Hezbollah.
- This is all very interesting, sir.

319
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:23,480
- It has nothing to do with me.
- We find hardware in your apartment.

320
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:25,400
Latest military spec.

321
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:26,640
- Airplane manuals.
- I told you about this already.

322
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:29,320
And 1,200 pounds
of ammonium nitrate fertilizer.

323
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:30,400
I walked into my apartment...

324
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:32,120
You planning on becoming
a farmer or something?

325
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:34,520
I walk into my apartment,
I open the door,

326
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:35,760
and this shit's all over my apartment.

327
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:37,200
- It just showed up.
- It just showed up.

328
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:39,960
I see. I'm just curious
if your brother knew anything about it.

329
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:44,000
Of course, we haven't really established
how close you guys were yet, have we?

330
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:46,800
Well, we were pretty close this morning
when I buried his body in the ground.

331
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:49,360
Does that establish anything for you?
Somebody set me up.

332
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:50,720
Why is that so hard
for you to understand?

333
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:52,240
- "Somebody."
- A woman called me on the phone.

334
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:53,400
She told me I was going to be arrested.

335
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:54,760
"A woman." Your mom? Who?

336
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:58,280
I don't know! If I knew, I would tell you!
I don't know!

337
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:03,560
Here's the thing, Jerry.

338
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:06,720
This is a bad time to be
in the terrorism business.

339
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:08,480
You read the paper.

340
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:11,520
Who do you think is winning?

341
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:16,240
Your Miranda rights or my right to keep
you in this room as long as I want to?

342
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:19,120
I don't care if you tell me
the truth about your brother.

343
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:21,320
I don't care who you work for.

344
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:26,680
'Cause no matter what you tell me,
you're in a shitload of trouble, son.

345
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:35,600
This is insane. I work for Copy Cabana.

346
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:37,600
Yeah, that's what you said.

347
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:46,240
Listen, I get one night out
in a decade, ladies,

348
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:48,280
I am not wasting it on Lemon Drops.

349
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:50,360
- Okay.
- Buck up. Let's go.

350
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:57,000
Oh, gosh.

351
00:22:57,680 --> 00:23:00,720
I want updates. Catfights, booty calls,
somebody tell me they got lucky.

352
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:04,840
Hey, ladies. See that guy over there?
He'd like to buy you a round.

353
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:08,120
Hell, no.
He's got light beer written all over him.

354
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:09,280
- He's cute.
- Come on.

355
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:10,400
He's a suit. No.

356
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:11,680
You sure?

357
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:13,120
- Come on.
- Who is it?

358
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:16,640
The one man in my life
who hasn't let me down.

359
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:20,680
- That's sweet.
- All right, don't drink those without me.

360
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:22,800
Hello?

361
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:24,520
Hello?

362
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:28,920
<i>There's a McDonald's across the street.
Look in the window.</i>

363
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:30,080
What is this?

364
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:32,680
<i>Would you risk your life for your son?</i>

365
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:40,800
<i>Rachel Holloman,
you've been activated.</i>

366
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:42,640
<i>- This isn't funny.
- Your compliance is vital.</i>

367
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:44,640
<i>- Who are you?
- We will derail his train,</i>

368
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:46,280
<i>unless you do what you're told.</i>

369
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:47,320
What is this?

370
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:49,160
<i>Don't go back inside the restaurant.</i>

371
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:51,640
<i>- What?
- There's a black Porsche Cayenne</i>

372
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:54,360
<i>parked at the northeast corner
of this block.</i>

373
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:57,520
<i>The keys are in the ignition.
Start walking.</i>

374
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:01,360
Oh, my God.

375
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:06,320
<i>911.
State the nature of your emergency.</i>

376
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:09,320
Yeah, some woman just called me.
I have... I have no idea who she is.

377
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:11,320
She was telling me that...

378
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:19,280
<i>Your phone is being monitored.
Disobey again and your son dies.</i>

379
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:25,720
Hey, Grant, I can't read this Shaw file.

380
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:27,720
- Grant!
- Excuse me.

381
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:30,880
Listen, my eyes aren't getting any better
and these screens are getting smaller.

382
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:32,400
Could you please find me
something I can read?

383
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:33,960
I can make the text bigger
on your screen.

384
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:35,480
No, no, no. I'm talking about paper.

385
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:36,920
Remember, like in the olden times?

386
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,440
- Paper. Okay.
- Yeah.

387
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:41,320
Agent Morgan. Zoe Perez,
Air Force Special Investigations.

388
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:43,720
Ethan Shaw, the twin,
he was one of ours.

389
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:46,400
Yeah.
OSI said they were sending a liaison.

390
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:48,160
Can you walk and talk
at the same time?

391
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:49,480
I'll do my best.

392
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:51,400
File says he died in a traffic accident.

393
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:55,160
Truck ran a light, corner of
Constitution and 10th, Northwest D.C.

394
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:57,440
So truck ran a light,
his brother gets 750 large

395
00:24:57,560 --> 00:24:59,560
and enough hardware
to start his own Costco,

396
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:02,040
five hours after enemy
chatter hits the roof.

397
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:03,880
I mean, don't you find that
a little coincidental?

398
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:08,480
<i>What if it's a decoy? To distract us from
something 50 times bigger.</i>

399
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:22,560
- Time for your phone call.
- I thought I didn't get one.

400
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:25,440
Attorney General's office
changed their mind.

401
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:29,400
Ethan Shaw had a 183 IQ

402
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:31,680
and yet you had him
as a mid-level press flak.

403
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:33,320
Why not IT or cyber-warfare?

404
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:35,320
Are you suggesting
that he was overqualified?

405
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:37,720
Or that he was somehow slipping intel
to the Copy Cabana?

406
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:39,560
No, I'm suggesting
that maybe Ethan Shaw

407
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:43,560
was a superstar rocket scientist genius
who did go wrong,

408
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:47,120
and the Air Force doesn't want
their dirty laundry flapping in the wind.

409
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:50,760
Think what you like, but I need to get in
that room and interrogate him myself.

410
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:51,840
No.

411
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:02,480
You don't have a choice. Look.

412
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:05,520
Now, neither of us know if either of
those brothers are guilty or innocent,

413
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:10,160
so on behalf of the Secretary
of the Air Force, I'm going in that room.

414
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:13,480
Well, on behalf of
all that fucking bomb equipment

415
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:16,480
in junior pinhead's apartment,
no, you're not.

416
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:28,760
<i>We told you to run.
We have planned your escape.</i>

417
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:30,680
How'd you get on this phone?
Who are you?

418
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:32,600
<i>Lay flat on the floor immediately.</i>

419
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:34,040
What the...
What the hell are you talking about?

420
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:35,160
<i>Four seconds, Jerry.</i>

421
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:37,360
<i>- No, this is bullshit. I don't...
- Get down now.</i>

422
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:38,720
<i>Two seconds.</i>

423
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:01,920
No!

424
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:08,080
- No! I didn't do this!
- Get down!

425
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:14,200
Shit.

426
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:49,800
<i>Standing passengers,
please do not lean against the doors.</i>

427
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:58,400
<i>... fourteen Americans dead
throughout Europe and the Middle East,</i>

428
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:01,200
<i>with terror groups insisting
this is just the beginning</i>

429
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:05,240
<i>of a campaign the West invited
when it allegedly rained bombs</i>

430
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:08,200
<i>on a religious ceremony
outside the small town of Abda,</i>

431
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:10,480
<i>near the border of Afghanistan.</i>

432
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:25,000
<i>Stay on the train for three more stations
and wait at the bottom of the platform.</i>

433
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:26,800
<i>You will receive...</i>

434
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:52,880
<i>Doors closing. Standing passengers,
please do not lean against the doors.</i>

435
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:19,560
- Help!
- Jimmy.

436
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:23,400
My baby. I need some help. Somebody.

437
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:25,000
<i>- What?
- You're not listening.</i>

438
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:26,760
<i>We told you to stay on the train.</i>

439
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:29,440
<i>- How are you doing this?
- Next stop is Wilson Station.</i>

440
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:32,120
<i>A black Porsche Cayenne will be
waiting at the northwest exit.</i>

441
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:33,640
<i>- Listen.
- Get in the passenger seat.</i>

442
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:36,160
Listen! No, I'm done.

443
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:41,240
<i>- Hello?
- The man in front of the exit door</i>

444
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:43,720
<i>in a black coat is a wanted terrorist.</i>

445
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:46,800
<i>- His name is Jerry Shaw.
- Who is this?</i>

446
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:50,440
- You Jerry Shaw?
- No, no, no.

447
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:52,440
<i>Wilson Station. Exit now.</i>

448
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:54,360
That's the guy!

449
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:59,080
I said, are you Jerry Shaw?
Hey! Come here!

450
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:21,520
Watch it!

451
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:27,560
- Drive the car! Drive the car!
- No!

452
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:29,160
- I did what you asked me to do!
- I'm not going anywhere...

453
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:30,720
- You tell... Stop!
...until you tell me my son's safe!

454
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:32,640
Who's your son?
I don't know what you're talking about!

455
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:34,640
- I'll kill you if you hurt my son!
- I almost died over this shit!

456
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:36,480
- Listen, lady, I don't know who...
- Tell me Sam is safe!

457
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:37,920
Who is... Will you stop hitting me?

458
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,480
Are you the woman
who called me on the phone?

459
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:42,800
- Did you call me on the phone?
- No. The woman.

460
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:44,320
- She called you, too?
- She called you, too?

461
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:45,560
<i>Drive.</i>

462
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:50,360
Get out! Now! Get out of the vehicle!

463
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:52,960
Stop!

464
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:02,160
- Why is this happening?
- Go, go, go, go, go!

465
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:04,080
Who are you and
why are people shooting at us?

466
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:06,480
Drive the car! Clutch!

467
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:09,920
<i>Accelerate. Turn right, 200 feet.
You have pursuers.</i>

468
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:12,720
<i>- Yeah, no shit! Who are you?
- No questions.</i>

469
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:15,120
<i>Turn right now.</i>

470
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:22,680
So you don't know anything about Sam?

471
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:24,600
What, you mean your son?
No, I know nothing.

472
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:25,680
Just like you don't know how to drive.

473
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:27,400
Use the clutch before you shift,
not while you shift!

474
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:28,440
I don't need driving lessons
from you, asshole!

475
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:30,360
What, you drive like this
and I'm the asshole?

476
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:31,880
<i>Turn left now.</i>

477
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:42,920
All units. Suspect in a Porsche
Cayenne heading west on Grand.

478
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:45,520
- All units respond, Code 3.
- There!

479
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:54,920
<i>Maintain a speed of 50 miles an hour.
Stay in the second lane from the right.</i>

480
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,320
<i>- The light's red!
- Accelerate now.</i>

481
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:09,400
Get me a roadblock
at Granville and Sheridan.

482
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:10,720
Oh, shit.

483
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:16,320
The lights are all turning green.

484
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:22,040
Holy shit!

485
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:37,120
- Holy...
- Shit!

486
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:42,000
Get in close.

487
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,280
Go, go, go!

488
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:50,640
<i>- Shit!
- Brake. Brake now.</i>

489
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:52,640
Get in here!

490
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:04,240
<i>Accelerate to 60 miles per hour.</i>

491
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:08,360
Clutch. Clutch!

492
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:10,120
- Use the clutch!
- I'm clutching!

493
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:12,600
I'm watching, you're not clutching!

494
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:17,680
- Stop!
- I'm not stopping.

495
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:21,600
Slow down. Slow down, the light's red.

496
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:24,600
<i>Don't slow down.
Accelerate to 72 miles per hour.</i>

497
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:26,520
<i>- Slow down. It's a red light!
- You will make it through.</i>

498
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:28,040
- Stop!
- No way.

499
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:30,240
- Brake!
- I can't!

500
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:33,520
- Brake!
- Stop!

501
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:52,480
<i>Manual control's been restored.</i>

502
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:55,760
<i>Continue straight
until you reach Pier 15.</i>

503
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:05,920
<i>Enter the wrecking yard.
Proceed to the end of the dock.</i>

504
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,600
<i>We will eliminate all obstacles for you.</i>

505
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:18,680
Watch! Watch! Watch!

506
00:34:47,640 --> 00:34:49,480
<i>- Stay your course.
- Turn!</i>

507
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,120
<i>- Turn!
- Turn right now.</i>

508
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:10,480
Holy...

509
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:23,600
Oh, God.

510
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:26,000
Oh, my God!

511
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:31,280
- Grab the seat.
- I can't.

512
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:33,680
- Grab the seat! The seat!
- No, I can't!

513
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:36,560
No!

514
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:51,600
<i>The crane will release the car.
If you do not jump, you will drown.</i>

515
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:54,760
- We have to jump.
- No! No way.

516
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:57,560
We have to. When I say "go."

517
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:01,120
Ready?

518
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:04,440
Go! Jump!

519
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:24,880
I want both the divers in that water!

520
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:30,640
- Let's go! Move!
- Let's go, let's go!

521
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:31,880
Move, move, move!

522
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:51,720
- Yeah, I already called it in!
- Wait till it clears!

523
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:54,720
Thirty feet back, that's it!

524
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:56,240
Yeah, I know,
the Army sent a Black Hawk,

525
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:57,680
so I'll be there in a couple of hours.

526
00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:00,560
What do you mean,
the car is not registered to anyone?

527
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:01,800
Check the VIN number again.

528
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:06,800
<i>Leave your message for Sam,
even though I know it's you, Mom.</i>

529
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:10,040
Sam? Baby, listen to me.

530
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:12,920
You need to call me
as soon as you get this message, okay?

531
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:17,160
Baby, please. I love you.

532
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:20,720
- What about the girl?
- What?

533
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:22,320
What about the girl?

534
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:24,360
Well, the Department of Transpo
tells me that there was

535
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:26,760
a seven-minute equipment failure
on their traffic cams.

536
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:28,480
- We didn't get a picture of her.
- Don't tell me that.

537
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:30,960
- That's what they're telling me!
- I need an ID on that girl.

538
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:35,680
Do you think they could derail a train?

539
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:39,200
They changed every traffic light
to get us here.

540
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:41,040
The woman, she called me
on a stranger's cell phone

541
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:43,240
who happened to be sitting next to me.
Never met the guy in my life.

542
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:45,160
You know, and then they broke me out
of maximum security custody

543
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:47,440
in a way I'm not even gonna describe
to you because it sounds crazy,

544
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:51,000
and then they lift us off the face of
the Earth and drop us into this shit pile?

545
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:52,240
She could probably derail a train.

546
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:53,960
She could probably turn a train
into a talking duck.

547
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:57,800
And what about these goddamn ghost
cranes that keep helping peewee out?

548
00:37:57,920 --> 00:38:00,680
I mean, they don't just lift cars
up in the air all by themselves

549
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:02,240
like a giant pair of chopsticks.

550
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:05,200
I want to know how these things run,
how they're programmed.

551
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:07,680
What'd you say your name was?

552
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:09,800
- Rachel.
- I'm Jerry.

553
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:19,760
<i>- Hello?
- The barge will dock in 14 minutes.</i>

554
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:24,000
<i>Leave the boatyard with the female.
Take Highway 123 East.</i>

555
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:26,600
<i>Walk to mile marker 108.</i>

556
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:31,200
- What? Was it her?
- She called you "the female."

557
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:35,600
Have Mortuary Affairs freeze everything
belonging to Ethan Shaw.

558
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:38,880
- No personal effects to next of kin.
- You, Due Process!

559
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:40,680
- Bye.
- What do you have on Ethan Shaw?

560
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:43,360
I have a name. It's Agent Perez.

561
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:45,560
And I'll answer that question
when I get back from D.C.

562
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:48,920
- Wait a minute. What's in D.C.?
- Shaw's private quarters.

563
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:52,760
I need you to stay here.
I'm not losing my link to Ethan Shaw.

564
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:54,800
Maybe I haven't made this clear.

565
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:57,760
I don't work for you.
I work for the Air Force.

566
00:38:57,840 --> 00:39:00,520
Keep your phone on,
I'll keep you updated.

567
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:09,640
If you're staring at me, it better be
because I'm the goddamn suspect.

568
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:13,280
Because if I don't get some good leads
soon, you're all gonna be demoted

569
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:16,560
into something that's gonna require
touching shit with your hands.

570
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:19,640
Now, let's get going. We got work to do.

571
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:30,360
Hexamethylene.
Our latest chemical explosive.

572
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:35,720
One single tiny crystal,
80 times more powerful than C4.

573
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:38,040
Odorless, undetectable.

574
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:41,600
<i>And best of all, it can be
cut down in size for stealth operations.</i>

575
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:43,520
This valve is a sonic trigger.

576
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:45,800
<i>The sound frequency
triggers the explosion.</i>

577
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:48,000
Each trigger is programmed
to have a unique

578
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:50,600
frequency specific
only to one Hex crystal.

579
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:52,600
<i>That frequency triggers the explosion.</i>

580
00:39:57,800 --> 00:39:58,840
<i>Yeah.</i>

581
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:02,680
We recently received approval
to begin shipping to the field.

582
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:04,520
Two hundred units
are shipping out today.

583
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:27,120
- Sign right here.
- Yeah.

584
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:28,680
Thank you.

585
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:35,280
<i>The package you've just received
contains a small metal valve.</i>

586
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:36,840
<i>Open the package.</i>

587
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:41,920
<i>- Okay.
- Remove the valve</i>

588
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,200
<i>and follow our instructions precisely.</i>

589
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:55,440
<i>- You've received the package.
- Yes, ma'am, it just arrived.</i>

590
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:57,720
<i>- What kind of stone is this?
- No questions.</i>

591
00:40:57,840 --> 00:40:59,360
<i>Cut the stone and place the setting</i>

592
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:01,560
<i>according to the specifications
we sent you.</i>

593
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:45,680
<i>I'd just dropped my son off at the train.</i>

594
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:48,480
<i>I was out having drinks with my
girlfriends when the call came.</i>

595
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:51,040
<i>- What about you?
- The first call came to my apartment.</i>

596
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:53,280
<i>- After the boxes?
- Yeah.</i>

597
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:57,680
Well, then this whole thing's
obviously gotta be about your brother.

598
00:41:57,760 --> 00:41:59,800
- Really, it's that obvious, huh?
- I mean, you got all this stuff.

599
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:01,320
The weapons, the cash,
the airplane manuals.

600
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:02,480
- Okay.
- He was your twin.

601
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:03,520
- They sent it to the wrong brother.
- Right.

602
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:04,760
So you're implying
my brother's a terrorist.

603
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:07,360
I'm implying, if not him, then why you?

604
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:15,600
I'm sorry. I know he just died. I'm not
trying to insult his memory or anything.

605
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:18,480
No, he hasn't been dead long enough
to be a memory, Rachel.

606
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:20,600
If you knew my brother,
you'd laugh all day at the idea

607
00:42:20,680 --> 00:42:22,720
that he was a terrorist or a spy
or whatever else you're saying...

608
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:23,840
- How do you know?
- Because he's my brother.

609
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:25,120
That's something you would know
about your brother.

610
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:27,400
Well, when's the last time
you talked to him?

611
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:37,080
I don't need this. Hey, listen. Hey!
I don't have to explain myself to you.

612
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:38,920
- Is your son a terrorist?
- Yeah, my son's a terrorist.

613
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,040
Yeah, well, he's just as likely
to be a terrorist as my brother.

614
00:42:41,120 --> 00:42:43,720
And let's not forget you in all this. Why
are you here? What's your day job?

615
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:45,440
- I know it isn't manual shift driver.
- I'm a paralegal.

616
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:47,240
- I don't have a connection to anything.
- Paralegal?

617
00:42:47,240 --> 00:42:47,560
- I don't have a connection to anything.
- Paralegal?

618
00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:49,760
How do I know you're not lying to me?
What does a paralegal do?

619
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:51,560
The same thing as the guys
with their names on the door,

620
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:55,040
except I do it for $11 an hour,
so they can bill 200.

621
00:42:55,120 --> 00:42:56,360
That nail it for you, Sherlock?

622
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:58,000
That still doesn't explain why
we're walking out here...

623
00:42:58,080 --> 00:43:00,200
- I don't know why the hell I'm out here!
- Yeah, I know...

624
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:08,160
Hey!

625
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:11,800
- Are you Jerry Shaw?
- Who are you?

626
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:14,200
- Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
- I sent the package like she asked.

627
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:15,560
- Wait, what package?
- What is that?

628
00:43:15,720 --> 00:43:16,880
- Now she wants me to drive you?
- Who, "she"?

629
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:18,320
- I won't. I'm done!
- You know "she"?

630
00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:19,400
- Wait.
- Stay right there.

631
00:43:19,560 --> 00:43:20,920
- Get back.
- Here. Here's the address.

632
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,800
- Why are you attack...
- Here. Here are the keys.

633
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:24,840
Take the goddamn van!

634
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:25,920
- You think I'm going to...
- Who's doing this?

635
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:29,440
...do this because I'm Iranian?
I am American. I'm finished! I'm done!

636
00:43:29,560 --> 00:43:31,960
- What? What are you talking about?
- You take it!

637
00:43:32,040 --> 00:43:33,760
- What are you talking about?
- I won't do this because I can't.

638
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:35,800
<i>- Hello?
- Stop him now, or he will die.</i>

639
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:37,400
Listen to me,
what are you talking about?

640
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:39,440
- You try to do this without me!
- How are you seeing us right now?

641
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:41,520
<i>- Stop him now.
- What is she saying?</i>

642
00:43:41,640 --> 00:43:43,920
Stop. Hey! You gotta stop!

643
00:43:44,040 --> 00:43:46,720
- Wait!
- You gotta stop!

644
00:44:18,760 --> 00:44:21,640
<i>- You killed that man.
- Desertion is not an option.</i>

645
00:44:21,720 --> 00:44:24,400
<i>Take the van.
Drive to Indianapolis, Indiana.</i>

646
00:44:24,520 --> 00:44:29,120
<i>72 West 56th Street.
Arrive no later than 11:00 a.m.</i>

647
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:42,800
- Welcome.
- Hello. Agent Perez.

648
00:44:43,600 --> 00:44:44,720
- To the right?
- Yes, ma'am.

649
00:44:45,880 --> 00:44:47,520
- ID, ma'am.
- OSI.

650
00:44:47,600 --> 00:44:50,120
I ordered a freeze on Ethan Shaw's
personal effects. What's going on?

651
00:44:50,200 --> 00:44:51,840
Orders to sanitize came down
from the Two Star.

652
00:44:52,040 --> 00:44:53,640
Okay, I'm countermanding.
Thank you. I'll take that.

653
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:54,920
- Tell your guys to clear out.
- Who are you?

654
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:56,520
This scene's part of
a federal investigation

655
00:44:56,640 --> 00:44:58,560
with national security ramifications.
This your log?

656
00:44:58,640 --> 00:45:00,160
- Yes, it is.
- Okay, my name is Agent Perez.

657
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:01,240
You can take this up
with your superiors.

658
00:45:01,320 --> 00:45:02,400
- Clear the room!
- You guys move out.

659
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:04,480
No gloves?
Get statements from everybody.

660
00:45:04,600 --> 00:45:05,840
- Yes, ma'am.
- And find out who this Two Star is.

661
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:07,760
I mean, come on, really!

662
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:25,200
Sir! We have a positive ID.

663
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:36,720
Okay.

664
00:45:37,960 --> 00:45:40,440
The skin was pretty fried,
but we still managed to get

665
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:44,400
a partial print that matches
to a Ranim Khalid.

666
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:48,800
He's a United States citizen, registered
Republican, and he owns a music store.

667
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:51,280
- The guy's cleaner than lvory Snow.
- Got something here.

668
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:54,760
- That's a bone mic.
- Hello.

669
00:45:54,840 --> 00:45:57,240
Military grade.
He didn't get that on eBay.

670
00:45:57,320 --> 00:45:58,960
Someone was talking to him.

671
00:46:29,360 --> 00:46:30,920
We have a cyber-terrorist here.

672
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,000
Someone's already inside
our computer systems,

673
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:37,720
hacking into the power grid,
traffic cams, automated cranes.

674
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:40,320
There's no way the boy
and the girl did this alone.

675
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:12,640
- Agent Zoe Perez?
- Yes.

676
00:47:12,720 --> 00:47:15,480
United States Air Force
Security Forces. Please come with us.

677
00:47:15,600 --> 00:47:17,520
- What's this about?
- Get in the car.

678
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:22,000
<i>Violence has broken out
in the Middle East as militants accuse</i>

679
00:47:22,120 --> 00:47:24,240
<i>the United States
of launching American missiles</i>

680
00:47:24,320 --> 00:47:28,360
<i>to demolish a village in Baluchistan,
killing innocent civilians.</i>

681
00:47:28,440 --> 00:47:31,720
<i>The attack has triggered a
series of retaliatory suicide bombings</i>

682
00:47:31,800 --> 00:47:34,000
<i>against American embassies abroad.</i>

683
00:47:34,120 --> 00:47:38,040
<i>Early reports indicate the American
death toll now stands at 56,</i>

684
00:47:38,520 --> 00:47:40,800
<i>with threats of further violence
here at home.</i>

685
00:47:40,920 --> 00:47:42,360
<i>Officials...</i>

686
00:47:47,800 --> 00:47:49,720
What's he doing on a train, your kid?

687
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:53,000
He goes to a music magnet.

688
00:47:53,080 --> 00:47:56,240
His school's on a tour of Washington.
They're playing at the Kennedy Center.

689
00:47:56,360 --> 00:47:59,920
Wow. That's big. And you just...

690
00:48:03,160 --> 00:48:05,160
Well, why'd you make that noise, "Huh"?

691
00:48:05,360 --> 00:48:06,800
I can't make noises now?

692
00:48:08,040 --> 00:48:10,160
- You think I should have gone.
- He's playing at the Kennedy Center.

693
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:11,600
- That's kind of a big deal.
- It is a big deal.

694
00:48:11,800 --> 00:48:13,920
So I think maybe one parent
should have gone, that's all I'm saying.

695
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:15,520
Well, one parent had to work
while the other one does

696
00:48:15,640 --> 00:48:18,320
everything humanly possible
to bail on child support.

697
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:22,040
But I don't expect you to know
a thing about responsibility.

698
00:48:23,880 --> 00:48:25,520
You know, Rachel, you don't know
the first thing about me.

699
00:48:25,600 --> 00:48:27,040
I know your brother just died,
and whatever he was into

700
00:48:27,120 --> 00:48:29,240
- put my son's life at risk.
- I don't wanna talk about my brother.

701
00:48:29,360 --> 00:48:31,760
- Okay? I'm not kidding.
- I'm not kidding, either.

702
00:48:31,840 --> 00:48:33,640
Jesus, look what happened.

703
00:48:34,600 --> 00:48:36,240
Can you honestly say he had
nothing to do with this?

704
00:48:36,360 --> 00:48:38,160
I'm asking you not to talk about him!
Respect that.

705
00:48:38,280 --> 00:48:40,080
I'm asking you to be honest
with yourself. Your brother's a...

706
00:48:40,080 --> 00:48:40,680
I'm asking you to be honest
with yourself. Your brother's a...

707
00:49:00,120 --> 00:49:05,680
Hey! You can't just walk away!
You can't just leave!

708
00:49:06,280 --> 00:49:07,720
- Yes, I can.
- Now we have 15 minutes to get

709
00:49:07,880 --> 00:49:10,480
- wherever the hell we're going, all right?
- Yeah.

710
00:49:19,520 --> 00:49:20,760
I need you.

711
00:49:25,160 --> 00:49:26,800
I could've gone.

712
00:49:30,520 --> 00:49:31,880
I should have.

713
00:49:57,880 --> 00:50:02,080
<i>You are two minutes behind schedule.
Go to the alley behind the building.</i>

714
00:50:05,160 --> 00:50:08,600
<i>- Go to the armored truck.
- I don't see an armored truck.</i>

715
00:50:09,640 --> 00:50:11,000
There it is.

716
00:50:16,280 --> 00:50:20,000
<i>In 20 seconds, men will exit
the elevator. They will be armed.</i>

717
00:50:20,120 --> 00:50:21,560
<i>One will be carrying a briefcase.</i>

718
00:50:21,640 --> 00:50:23,760
<i>Retrieve it from him,
then return to the van.</i>

719
00:50:23,840 --> 00:50:25,560
- This is insane. I'm not doing this.
- You want us to rob them?

720
00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:27,120
<i>You now have 15 seconds.</i>

721
00:50:30,200 --> 00:50:32,280
<i>Security. What's your emergency?</i>

722
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:40,560
What are you doing?
I'm not robbing them. Shit.

723
00:50:52,040 --> 00:50:53,200
Put your gun on the floor.

724
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:55,320
Put your gun on the floor! Look straight.

725
00:50:55,400 --> 00:50:57,240
You want me to blow his head off?
Put the gun on the ground!

726
00:50:57,320 --> 00:50:58,960
We don't wanna hurt you guys.
Just drop the case.

727
00:50:59,040 --> 00:51:00,280
Drop the case and kick it to her!

728
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:02,040
Yeah, well, you're bringing a shit storm
on your head.

729
00:51:02,120 --> 00:51:04,040
Yeah, we're already in mid shit storm!
Now kick the case.

730
00:51:04,120 --> 00:51:05,480
Okay! Easy.

731
00:51:06,920 --> 00:51:08,720
- Look straight.
- Okay, done.

732
00:51:08,840 --> 00:51:10,760
Kick it!

733
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:14,960
Okay.

734
00:51:15,080 --> 00:51:16,600
- Don't even think about it!
- Back up.

735
00:51:16,680 --> 00:51:17,760
Easy.

736
00:51:20,240 --> 00:51:21,400
Back up.

737
00:51:21,480 --> 00:51:23,200
Walk over here, stand next to him,
and turn around.

738
00:51:23,320 --> 00:51:25,720
- Stand over here!
- Just take it easy.

739
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:30,600
Turn around. Turn around. Turn around!

740
00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:44,040
Let's move, let's move!

741
00:51:47,960 --> 00:51:48,920
Come on!

742
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:04,640
Jerry! Here!

743
00:52:07,320 --> 00:52:08,400
Move, move!

744
00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:13,200
Freeze! Police!

745
00:52:13,360 --> 00:52:15,600
Drop the gun! Drop the gun!

746
00:52:15,680 --> 00:52:16,840
We're security! We just got robbed!

747
00:52:16,920 --> 00:52:19,120
And there they are! We just got robbed!

748
00:52:22,760 --> 00:52:24,880
Move! Get out of the way!

749
00:52:25,560 --> 00:52:26,400
Move!

750
00:52:31,200 --> 00:52:33,520
Get out of the way! Out of the way!

751
00:52:33,600 --> 00:52:34,480
Move!

752
00:52:36,120 --> 00:52:38,520
- Hey, watch it, lady!
- Jerry, run!

753
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:39,960
This way!

754
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:44,560
- Out of the way!
- Come on!

755
00:52:44,640 --> 00:52:46,160
- Move out of the way!
- Move!

756
00:52:48,560 --> 00:52:50,120
You see that? This way.

757
00:53:03,240 --> 00:53:04,800
- You are Jerry Shaw?
- Yeah.

758
00:53:06,320 --> 00:53:09,080
Please come. Please.

759
00:53:09,280 --> 00:53:10,640
- Thank you.
- Please come in.

760
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:15,440
Hi.

761
00:53:30,080 --> 00:53:32,320
- Wait. What is that?
- It's a timer.

762
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:34,520
- For what?
- I don't know.

763
00:53:34,600 --> 00:53:36,920
The only things I can think of
with timers are microwaves and...

764
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:38,520
And bombs.
You were gonna say bombs.

765
00:53:39,960 --> 00:53:42,680
- Coffeemakers have timers.
- Yeah, Jerry, it's a coffeemaker.

766
00:53:43,720 --> 00:53:44,960
That's great.

767
00:54:07,120 --> 00:54:08,920
We've mobilized every asset
we can get our hands on.

768
00:54:09,040 --> 00:54:10,760
So 12 more confirmed dead?

769
00:54:10,840 --> 00:54:12,000
Yes, sir.

770
00:54:13,160 --> 00:54:15,640
I want hourly sit reps
from General McKenna.

771
00:54:15,760 --> 00:54:18,440
There's a military base
37 miles from that port.

772
00:54:18,520 --> 00:54:19,760
Scramble whatever you can.

773
00:54:19,880 --> 00:54:21,400
- Yes, sir.
- Come with me.

774
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:26,400
Begging your pardon, sir,
but if you're thinking of taking me off

775
00:54:26,480 --> 00:54:28,600
- the Shaw investigation, I'd...
- Taking you off?

776
00:54:28,680 --> 00:54:31,560
Agent, for the first time
you're being brought onboard.

777
00:54:37,520 --> 00:54:40,960
Back to bus 30 minutes. Okay?
30 minutes.

778
00:54:46,040 --> 00:54:49,520
We're convinced a terrorist attack
on American soil is imminent.

779
00:54:49,600 --> 00:54:53,520
Over the past two days, we've received
over 200 terrorist threats.

780
00:54:53,640 --> 00:54:56,240
All starting the day
that Ethan Shaw died.

781
00:54:57,280 --> 00:55:02,280
An accident. Or not.
You're gonna help us find out.

782
00:55:04,960 --> 00:55:06,960
- Mr. Secretary.
- Gentlemen.

783
00:55:19,160 --> 00:55:22,320
- I didn't think that there was a 36th floor.
- Glad we can still keep some secrets.

784
00:55:33,160 --> 00:55:34,600
I want to know what's in the case.
Is it a bomb?

785
00:55:34,680 --> 00:55:37,080
<i>Go to Macy's.
Customer Service Department.</i>

786
00:55:37,280 --> 00:55:38,880
<i>Two Visa gift cards will be waiting.</i>

787
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:40,800
<i>You have 25 minutes
to purchase new clothes,</i>

788
00:55:40,920 --> 00:55:43,200
<i>and then re-board the bus
for your next destination.</i>

789
00:55:43,320 --> 00:55:45,880
I'm done taking orders over the phone,
you understand?

790
00:55:51,360 --> 00:55:53,680
Well, that was quick. You done playing
this hide-and-go-seek bullshit?

791
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:55,480
<i>We are not hiding, Jerry.</i>

792

<i>To your left is a Circuit City.

00:57:37,800 --> 00:57:39,360
<i>We know who you are.</i>

822
00:57:39,440 --> 00:57:40,800
<i>... at least 30 minutes late.</i>

823
00:57:40,880 --> 00:57:42,520
<i>Sam doesn't care!</i>

824
00:57:42,600 --> 00:57:43,880
<i>We are everywhere.</i>

825
00:57:43,960 --> 00:57:45,760
What do you mean?
Why do you keep saying "we"?

826
00:57:46,240 --> 00:57:47,880
<i>We the people of the United States...</i>

827
00:57:48,640 --> 00:57:50,280
<i>And so, my fellow Americans...</i>

828
00:57:50,560 --> 00:57:54,320
<i>... in order to form a more perfect union,</i>

829
00:57:54,520 --> 00:57:56,320
<i>establish justice,</i>

830
00:57:56,440 --> 00:57:58,440
<i>insure domestic tranquility,</i>

831
00:57:58,640 --> 00:58:00,720
<i>provide for the common defense...</i>

832
00:58:00,840 --> 00:58:02,080
<i>All programmed options...</i>

833
00:58:02,160 --> 00:58:03,440
<i>- Programmed options?
- ... sector searches,</i>

834
00:58:03,520 --> 00:58:07,760
<i>and downloaded points of data
will lead to this central command.</i>

835
00:58:09,080 --> 00:58:10,440
You're a computer.

836
00:58:11,480 --> 00:58:13,600
Say hello to our

00:58:13,680 --> 00:58:16,000
Intelligence Integration Analyst.

838
00:58:16,640 --> 00:58:18,880
We call her Aria.

839
00:58:23,200 --> 00:58:26,440
She crunches all our raw intel,
finds patterns,

840
00:58:26,520 --> 00:58:28,640
helps predict the movement
of possible suspects,

841
00:58:28,840 --> 00:58:32,680
right down to behavior, motivation,
even personality.

842
00:58:34,880 --> 00:58:37,960
<i>Transferring primary search function
to auxiliary display.</i>

843
00:58:38,720 --> 00:58:42,280
<i>- Hello, Secretary Callister.
- Aria.</i>

844
00:58:42,640 --> 00:58:46,600
Agent Zoe Perez, Air Force OSI.
You are to assist her

845
00:58:46,680 --> 00:58:50,400
<i>- in her investigation of Ethan Shaw.
- Yes, Mr. Secretary.</i>

846
00:58:51,480 --> 00:58:55,680
<i>Hello, Agent Perez. Perez, Zoe.
Middle name: Soledad.</i>

847
00:58:55,800 --> 00:58:59,040
<i>Official service records indicate
your field reports are very thorough,</i>

848
00:58:59,160 --> 00:59:00,600
<i>if poorly formatted.</i>

<i>Please excuse us.

<i>valid threat at Los Angeles

<i>Alerting airport authorities

852
00:59:11,440 --> 00:59:13,920
Those gold spheres send her
infrared data,

853
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:16,200
any communication intercepts
that she flags a threat.

854
00:59:17,160 --> 00:59:19,960
She analyzes it and tells us
what to pay attention to.

855
00:59:22,720 --> 00:59:25,320
<i>Dispatch to Terrorism Task Force.
Threat at LAX.</i>

856
00:59:25,440 --> 00:59:27,160
We're still beta-testing,

857
00:59:27,360 --> 00:59:29,360
but I'm pushing to get her online sooner.

858
00:59:34,640 --> 00:59:39,040
Mr. Secretary? A call for you.

859
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:41,840
- Try to keep up.
- Yes, sir.

860
00:59:42,480 --> 00:59:44,680
And find out about Shaw.

861
00:59:44,800 --> 00:59:46,440
- Major.
- Sir?

862
00:59:52,280 --> 00:59:55,360
<i>Your profile reveals a pathological
aversion to conformity,</i>

863
00:59:55,440 --> 00:59:58,320
<i>education, career, even voting.</i>

864
00:59:58,600 --> 01:00:00,600
<i>Therefore, we conclude
that extreme coercion</i>

865
01:00:00,800 --> 01:00:02,360
<i>is necessary to motivate you.</i>

866
01:00:02,440 --> 01:00:05,240
<i>Unlike your brother Ethan,
who was self-motivated.</i>

867
01:00:05,320 --> 01:00:07,240
How do you know my brother?
He worked in a press office.

868
01:00:07,320 --> 01:00:09,840
<i>His employment there was a cover.</i>

869
01:00:09,920 --> 01:00:13,080
<i>Everyone in counterintelligence
operations has one.</i>

870
01:00:14,160 --> 01:00:18,160
Ethan was a Minuteman, just like me.
Army, Navy, Air Force.

871
01:00:18,280 --> 01:00:20,560
Every branch of the military had
a Minuteman posted here

872
01:00:20,680 --> 01:00:25,440
for a 12-hour shift, just in case she
flags a threat, and monitor hardware.

873
01:00:25,560 --> 01:00:30,640
The night Ethan died, he left this post
three minutes early.

874
01:00:30,720 --> 01:00:33,600
Now, you don't do that. Ever.

875
01:00:34,080 --> 01:00:37,080
<i>You are both required
to complete a task.</i>

876
01:00:37,160 --> 01:00:39,640
<i>- What?
- The protection of our national security.</i>

877
01:00:39,840 --> 01:00:42,160
<i>The Constitution allows for civilians
to be recruited</i>

878
01:00:42,240 --> 01:00:43,480
<i>- for the national defense.
- I'm done.</i>

879
01:00:43,600 --> 01:00:45,600
I'm done. You don't know me!
You don't know my brother!

880
01:00:45,680 --> 01:00:48,560
This is bullshit! I'm not serving
in the goddamn national defense!

881
01:00:48,680 --> 01:00:51,360
<i>We know all about him, Jerry. And you.</i>

882
01:00:52,800 --> 01:00:55,200
<i>Before he was a year old,
Ethan walked.</i>

883
01:00:55,960 --> 01:00:58,920
<i>The same task took you
18 months to accomplish.</i>

884
01:01:01,040 --> 01:01:02,280
<i>- How did you get this?
- Look at Ethan.</i>

885
01:01:02,400 --> 01:01:04,680
<i>They were uploaded
from his home computer.</i>

886
01:01:04,760 --> 01:01:07,280
<i>You want to come over here, sweetie?
Come on over here with Ethan.</i>

887
01:01:07,360 --> 01:01:09,880
<i>- Jerry! Birthday cake. Let's go.
- Ethan had these?</i>

888
01:01:09,960 --> 01:01:11,200
<i>Come on, let's blow out the candles.</i>

889
01:01:11,320 --> 01:01:13,040
<i>Just for a little bit.</i>

890
01:01:13,120 --> 01:01:17,160
<i>Although you're identical in appearance,
you lack the motivation and talent</i>

891
01:01:17,240 --> 01:01:19,360
<i>- that enabled Ethan to excel.
- ... Jerry, come on.</i>

892
01:01:19,440 --> 01:01:21,080
<i>- Stop it.
- Do it like Ethan did.</i>

893
01:01:21,160 --> 01:01:24,840
<i>You're different from Ethan
in every way, except one.</i>

894
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:26,920
<i>Jerry, let your brother help you. Jerry!</i>

895
01:01:27,040 --> 01:01:30,960
<i>You now have 14 minutes to change
your appearance and return to the bus.</i>

896
01:01:40,080 --> 01:01:42,080
We have 14 minutes.

897
01:01:48,600 --> 01:01:50,640
These couriers were hired
by Halloway-Smith

898
01:01:50,720 --> 01:01:53,320
- to transport some sort of case.
- The chemical company?

899
01:01:53,400 --> 01:01:56,360
Yes, exactly. Now, whatever was
in that case, Shaw now has.

900
01:01:56,480 --> 01:01:57,920
They went right for the case.

901
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:02,400
Give us a minute, will you? We need
to know exactly what was in that case.

902
01:02:02,520 --> 01:02:05,480
They never tell you what's in the case.
I mean, it could Bubonic Plague.

903
01:02:05,600 --> 01:02:07,800
- Could be Grandpa's Viagra.
- You know anything?

904
01:02:07,880 --> 01:02:09,240
- What?
- Anything at all?

905
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:11,920
- What about these guns?
- What about them?

906
01:02:12,120 --> 01:02:13,360
It was a pump-action Remington 870.

907
01:02:13,440 --> 01:02:16,320
Yeah, I know what kind of guns they are.
Get me a gun.

908
01:02:16,400 --> 01:02:17,760
How were they holding them?
Get me a gun!

909
01:02:17,960 --> 01:02:19,280
What the hell do you mean,
how were they holding them?

910
01:02:19,400 --> 01:02:21,880
I mean, in what position
were they holding the gun?

911
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:24,280
- For instance, like this?
- Hey, hey, hey.

912
01:02:24,360 --> 01:02:25,720
- Put that damned thing down!
- Or like in a music video,

913
01:02:25,800 --> 01:02:26,960
- or something like that?
- Hey, hey, hey!

914
01:02:27,080 --> 01:02:28,040
- Put it down!
- They weren't pros!

915
01:02:28,120 --> 01:02:29,160
Okay, that's what I was asking you.

916
01:02:29,280 --> 01:02:30,720
So they didn't know
how to handle a weapon.

917
01:02:30,800 --> 01:02:31,880
- No.
- All right.

918
01:02:31,960 --> 01:02:33,760
Get what you can
out of Batman and Robin here.

919
01:02:33,880 --> 01:02:35,600
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

920
01:02:35,680 --> 01:02:38,280
We just checked cameras.
They said Shaw fired at one...

921
01:02:38,400 --> 01:02:41,080
Don't tell me.
Everything magically went black.

922
01:03:04,360 --> 01:03:06,680
Hi, my name's Thomas Morgan.
I'm with the FBI.

923
01:03:06,760 --> 01:03:09,560
<i>- Are your cameras on a network?
- No, man.</i>

924
01:03:09,640 --> 01:03:12,320
- VCR's in the back.
- Well, I'm gonna need your tapes.

925
01:03:15,120 --> 01:03:16,080
Shit.

926
01:03:18,960 --> 01:03:19,920
Sam!

927
01:03:20,280 --> 01:03:22,320
<i>- Sam? Sam, where are you?
- Hey, Mom, I got your message.</i>

928
01:03:22,400 --> 01:03:23,760
<i>The train's awesome!</i>

929
01:03:23,840 --> 01:03:25,480
<i>- Sam, listen to me.
- Brian tried to burp the alphabet,</i>

930
01:03:25,560 --> 01:03:27,280
<i>- but he gagged when he got to "M."
- Listen to me.</i>

931
01:03:27,400 --> 01:03:29,120
<i>Call you when I hit D.C. Bye, Mom.</i>

932
01:03:29,200 --> 01:03:31,520
<i>Your son left that message
60 seconds ago.</i>

933
01:03:31,800 --> 01:03:34,960
<i>You will see him again.
But there's something we require first.</i>

934
01:03:36,600 --> 01:03:39,080
- Thank you.
- Here you go.

935
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:46,960
<i>- No.
- You will do it, or Sam will die.</i>

936
01:03:47,320 --> 01:03:49,560
<i>You have six minutes
to return to the bus.</i>

937
01:03:58,160 --> 01:04:00,480
- Ready?
- Here, you okay?

938
01:04:00,840 --> 01:04:01,800
We should go.

939
01:04:05,640 --> 01:04:09,480
Sir, we got something.
Play this screen right here.

940
01:04:10,440 --> 01:04:13,440
Okay, freeze that. Now zoom in
on the front of the bus right there.

941
01:04:13,520 --> 01:04:14,880
- Put it up on the other monitor.
- Yes, sir.

942
01:04:14,960 --> 01:04:17,840
Now zoom in.
Zoom in on this point right here.

943
01:04:17,920 --> 01:04:19,640
Can we zoom in tighter than that?

944
01:04:21,960 --> 01:04:23,960
Okay, enhance that shot.

945
01:04:25,520 --> 01:04:27,720
That's our guy, that's Jerry Shaw.

946
01:04:28,760 --> 01:04:31,840
Zoom in right here on this spot.
Right there. The reflection.

947
01:04:31,920 --> 01:04:33,480
All right. All right.

948
01:04:33,560 --> 01:04:35,400
Right there. Hello, sweetheart.

949
01:04:35,480 --> 01:04:38,440
Okay, so we got
a white brunette female,

950
01:04:38,560 --> 01:04:40,760
mid to late 20s, approximately 5'9".

951
01:04:40,840 --> 01:04:42,480
Find me that chartered bus!

952
01:04:42,560 --> 01:04:46,120
Masako. M-A-S-A-K-O.
Sightseeing Tours.

953
01:04:46,240 --> 01:04:47,200
What time did they get on?

954
01:04:53,240 --> 01:04:55,720
I'm sorry for what I said about Ethan.

955
01:05:04,240 --> 01:05:06,640
It's like he had a rocket
strapped to his back.

956
01:05:06,760 --> 01:05:09,160
And it wasn't his fault.
He was just that way.

957
01:05:09,720 --> 01:05:11,640
And I was not that way.

958
01:05:13,560 --> 01:05:17,400
I was the complete opposite.
I was the brother with lead shoes.

959
01:05:19,520 --> 01:05:21,520
That was my role, I was good at it.

960
01:05:23,320 --> 01:05:26,120
And he'd always try to help me.
You know, "This is how you throw it."

961
01:05:26,200 --> 01:05:29,760
"Do it like this." "Write it like that."
"Put your foot here."

962
01:05:29,840 --> 01:05:33,320
Even with the small things.
Homework, chores, anything like that,

963
01:05:33,400 --> 01:05:35,040
he would handle it
and then say that I did it,

964
01:05:35,120 --> 01:05:39,440
just so my father would notice me.
That was Ethan.

965
01:05:46,640 --> 01:05:49,800
He never asked me for anything. Ever.

966
01:05:51,520 --> 01:05:56,440
And whatever this is, he was part of it.
I feel like he needs my help to finish it.

967
01:05:58,840 --> 01:06:00,160
I owe him that.

968
01:06:07,440 --> 01:06:10,520
<i>We are now approaching
Dayton International Airport.</i>

969
01:06:10,600 --> 01:06:15,600
<i>Please use caution as you exit the bus.
And don't forget any of your belongings.</i>

970
01:06:15,720 --> 01:06:16,760
<i>Thank you.</i>

971
01:06:18,200 --> 01:06:21,560
<i>Attention, passengers. Please do not
leave your luggage unattended.</i>

972
01:06:21,920 --> 01:06:24,120
<i>Unattended luggage is subject
to collection and search</i>

973
01:06:24,320 --> 01:06:27,480
<i>by the airport police.
Thank you for your cooperation.</i>

974
01:06:30,680 --> 01:06:32,400
Yes, I'm walking toward them now. Yes.

975
01:06:32,480 --> 01:06:36,040
Hey. These are from her.
Go to the ticketing machine.

976
01:06:36,120 --> 01:06:39,600
Use the credit card to get your tickets.
Then walk to Gate 1-C.

977
01:06:40,920 --> 01:06:42,280
They now have them.

978
01:06:47,840 --> 01:06:49,080
That's a nice picture.

979
01:06:55,320 --> 01:06:58,280
Okay. I need you guys at every exit,
watching faces.

980
01:06:58,480 --> 01:07:00,120
Work the secure area first.

981
01:07:00,200 --> 01:07:01,560
Go to the tower, have them order

982
01:07:01,640 --> 01:07:04,040
a ground stop.
Don't change the departure boards.

983
01:07:04,120 --> 01:07:05,840
We don't want them to know
we're coming.

984
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:17,360
Sir, can you please shut the cell phone
off? You cannot take it through.

985
01:07:17,480 --> 01:07:19,400
- FBI. Clear the way.
- FBI. Please step back.

986
01:07:24,640 --> 01:07:26,280
Please, there are others behind you.

987
01:07:26,400 --> 01:07:28,200
- Keep it moving.
- Shoes and hats off, please!

988
01:07:28,280 --> 01:07:31,280
- Shoes also, yes.
- Laptops should be out of their cases!

989
01:07:31,360 --> 01:07:33,680
You need to make sure your jackets
are off and screened separately.

990
01:07:33,760 --> 01:07:36,840
- Sir, step in the circle, please.
- Have boarding passes in hand, please!

991
01:07:36,920 --> 01:07:38,280
We need to move this line quickly.

992
01:07:38,360 --> 01:07:40,560
Sir, that needs to go through.

993
01:07:41,160 --> 01:07:43,760
Ma'am, anything in your pockets?
Move it along.

994
01:07:46,240 --> 01:07:48,040
Hats and shoes off, please!

995
01:07:48,160 --> 01:07:51,120
- Laptops should be out of your bags!
- All right, next in line, please.

996
01:07:51,240 --> 01:07:52,640
Have your tickets ready.

997
01:07:56,600 --> 01:08:00,320
- Ma'am? Hat and shoes go in the bin.
- Step through.

998
01:08:05,400 --> 01:08:06,360
Wait.

999
01:08:06,680 --> 01:08:11,640
Shoes and hats off, please!
Laptops should be out of their bags!

1000
01:08:22,960 --> 01:08:23,920
Go ahead.

1001
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:25,560
Please move to the back
and let the air crew go first.

1002
01:08:25,640 --> 01:08:28,920
Step through, ma'am.
Boarding pass, please. Thank you.

1003
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:30,360
Have your tickets ready.

1004
01:08:30,440 --> 01:08:32,080
- Have a safe trip.
- Thank you.

1005
01:08:32,280 --> 01:08:35,640
- All right, let's move forward. Next.
- She changed the screen.

1006
01:08:35,720 --> 01:08:38,600
Lay it down flat inside the bin.

1007
01:08:40,520 --> 01:08:44,240
- Please have boarding pass in hand!
- Right over here, ma'am.

1008
01:08:44,360 --> 01:08:46,760
Laptops should be out of their bags!

1009
01:09:00,160 --> 01:09:02,760
FBI! Out of the way!

1010
01:09:02,960 --> 01:09:05,080
Out of the way, out of the way!
Move, move!

1011
01:09:05,720 --> 01:09:07,160
Move!

1012
01:09:15,040 --> 01:09:17,360
- Everybody, get down!
- Over here!

1013
01:09:18,480 --> 01:09:20,400
- Move, move!
- Oh, my God!

1014
01:09:21,080 --> 01:09:23,280
Stay down! Get out of the way!

1015
01:09:33,080 --> 01:09:34,120
- Sir, sir, sir!
- Yes?

1016
01:09:34,240 --> 01:09:36,600
I need your help. I'm sorry. Come here!

1017
01:09:40,160 --> 01:09:41,320
Thank you.

1018
01:09:55,520 --> 01:09:57,440
Hey, you aren't supposed to be in here!

1019
01:10:26,760 --> 01:10:28,200
Go, go, go!

1020
01:11:20,280 --> 01:11:21,240
Move!

1021
01:12:39,320 --> 01:12:41,120
<i>Set the briefcase down.</i>

1022
01:12:49,880 --> 01:12:51,120
<i>Open it.</i>

1023
01:12:52,840 --> 01:12:55,240
<i>Load a vial into each syringe
and inject yourselves.</i>

1024
01:12:55,440 --> 01:12:57,920
<i>- What is it?
- An experimental heart drug.</i>

1025
01:12:58,000 --> 01:12:59,840
<i>- The cargo hold is unpressurized.
- Take this.</i>

1026
01:12:59,920 --> 01:13:03,280
<i>The injections will lower your heart rate,
reducing your need for oxygen.</i>

1027
01:13:03,400 --> 01:13:04,360
No.

1028
01:13:05,600 --> 01:13:07,320
- Roll your sleeve up.
- No, I can't do this.

1029
01:13:07,400 --> 01:13:08,480
Roll your...

1030
01:13:08,560 --> 01:13:10,000
No! No, no, no, I can't.

1031
01:13:10,120 --> 01:13:12,680
<i>- We have to. Ready?
- You have a 92% chance of survival.</i>

1032
01:13:12,800 --> 01:13:14,040
- No.
- We have to.

1033
01:13:14,120 --> 01:13:16,520
<i>Do it now, or you will suffocate.</i>

1034
01:13:19,120 --> 01:13:19,960
Okay.

1035
01:13:20,440 --> 01:13:21,880
<i>Get in the crate.</i>

1036
01:13:22,080 --> 01:13:23,160
No. No.

1037
01:13:24,680 --> 01:13:28,520
- No, no. Oh, God.
- Stop it. Stop it.

1038
01:13:32,920 --> 01:13:34,000
Why is that plane on the runway?

1039
01:13:34,080 --> 01:13:37,160
Shit, the military's cleared to
override a terminal lockdown.

1040
01:13:37,240 --> 01:13:38,600
Okay, I want you to work with the FAA.

1041
01:13:38,680 --> 01:13:42,040
I want to know what's in that plane
and where it's going.

1042
01:13:47,600 --> 01:13:49,440
- Oh, my God.
- You'll be all right.

1043
01:13:49,520 --> 01:13:51,360
Just talk to me.
We just gotta talk it through.

1044
01:13:51,440 --> 01:13:53,560
- Okay.
- Just tell me anything.

1045
01:13:54,880 --> 01:13:57,200
Anything you'd never rationally
tell a stranger.

1046
01:13:57,280 --> 01:13:58,520
You're being sweet, but it's not working.

1047
01:13:58,640 --> 01:14:00,720
Just tell me anything. Your ex-husband.

1048
01:14:00,840 --> 01:14:03,120
- You didn't tell me about him.
- Okay, you're gonna distract me by

1049
01:14:03,240 --> 01:14:04,560
bringing up the biggest mistake
of my life?

1050
01:14:04,680 --> 01:14:06,880
It can't be the biggest mistake.
You got your child out of it.

1051
01:14:06,960 --> 01:14:07,920
- You know? You got Sam out of it.
- Yeah, yeah,

1052
01:14:08,040 --> 01:14:10,120
now you're gonna distract me
by bringing up

1053
01:14:10,240 --> 01:14:13,200
- the one thing I'm most afraid of losing.
- Oh, God, you're hard to please.

1054
01:14:14,080 --> 01:14:15,320
I'm sorry.

1055
01:14:16,760 --> 01:14:20,800
Is your son handsome?
Yeah? What's he look like?

1056
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:24,800
- You got a picture?
- Yeah.

1057
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:26,440
Well, let me see.

1058
01:14:29,120 --> 01:14:31,240
- There he is.
- The tooth grew in.

1059
01:14:31,320 --> 01:14:33,440
- I hope so.
- It's an old picture.

1060
01:14:34,400 --> 01:14:35,280
See? You're a good influence.

1061
01:14:35,360 --> 01:14:38,520
He plays an instrument.
He's got a happy face. He's got teeth.

1062
01:14:39,560 --> 01:14:41,960
You beat yourself up for no reason.

1063
01:14:43,720 --> 01:14:45,920
Let's keep going.
What's the husband's name?

1064
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:47,840
- Ex.
- Ex-husband. What's his name?

1065
01:14:47,920 --> 01:14:50,400
- Craig.
- Craig sounds like a shithead.

1066
01:14:50,520 --> 01:14:52,040
He is a shithead.

1067
01:14:52,800 --> 01:14:56,080
I mean, every year he forgets
his own son's birthday.

1068
01:14:56,560 --> 01:14:59,320
Really? That sucks.

1069
01:15:02,120 --> 01:15:04,800
I mean, after I kicked his ass out,

1070
01:15:06,320 --> 01:15:09,400
I was so scared
I didn't know what I was gonna do.

1071
01:15:13,440 --> 01:15:15,240
And then this one night,

1072
01:15:17,080 --> 01:15:19,840
I went into Sam's room,
he was, like, three months old,

1073
01:15:22,440 --> 01:15:24,840
and there he was, just smiling at me.

1074
01:15:25,920 --> 01:15:27,640
And that little face...

1075
01:15:32,240 --> 01:15:35,200
And I was, like, I'm gonna do this.
I can do this.

1076
01:15:36,640 --> 01:15:38,360
Whatever it takes.

1077
01:15:46,600 --> 01:15:50,280
I'm not gonna...
I'm not gonna disappoint you.

1078
01:15:55,160 --> 01:15:57,760
Aria, would you please bring up
the video log

1079
01:15:57,840 --> 01:15:59,360
of the night Ethan Shaw died?

1080
01:15:59,480 --> 01:16:04,560
<i>Sequencing video log 1137-Z.
Here you are, Major.</i>

1081
01:16:04,640 --> 01:16:06,960
See that?
He's leaving three minutes early,

1082
01:16:07,040 --> 01:16:09,840
and he's not even waiting
for logout confirmation.

1083
01:16:10,200 --> 01:16:12,400
- Can you play that again?
- Sure.

1084
01:16:16,040 --> 01:16:17,600
Did you see that?

1085
01:16:17,680 --> 01:16:19,400
With his cell phone.

1086
01:16:24,200 --> 01:16:26,320
Look, he's doing that on purpose.
Is that Morse code?

1087
01:16:26,400 --> 01:16:28,160
- Yeah.
- Here.

1088
01:16:36,600 --> 01:16:39,080
Why is he walking in circles
around the elevator?

1089
01:16:39,160 --> 01:16:41,480
<i>- Initiating video shutdown for analysis.
- No.</i>

1090
01:16:41,680 --> 01:16:44,240
No, Aria, wait.
Listen, I'm prioritizing this feed.

1091
01:16:44,360 --> 01:16:46,280
<i>- Stay with this.
- Apologies, Major Bowman.</i>

1092
01:16:46,360 --> 01:16:47,800
<i>Critical data sectors
have been corrupted.</i>

1093
01:16:47,880 --> 01:16:49,800
Aria, this is important!
Stay with this feed!

1094
01:16:49,920 --> 01:16:51,160
<i>Video sequence erased.</i>

1095
01:16:51,240 --> 01:16:53,560
Aria, go to the backups!
Do not erase this!

1096
01:16:53,640 --> 01:16:55,360
- It's a priority. You hear me?
- Bowman.

1097
01:16:55,480 --> 01:16:58,160
- Loop it. Whatever you have to do.
- Bowman.

1098
01:17:05,720 --> 01:17:08,040
It's the only place she can't see.

1099
01:17:09,280 --> 01:17:10,640
This way.

1100
01:17:25,960 --> 01:17:27,680
It's a memory card

1101
01:17:28,480 --> 01:17:30,680
<i>from Ethan's cell phone.</i>

1102
01:17:34,400 --> 01:17:36,440
<i>Aria, listen. You do not have
permission to exceed your authority</i>

1103
01:17:36,520 --> 01:17:39,000
<i>and act independently.
Do you understand?</i>

1104
01:17:56,200 --> 01:17:57,320
Let's go.

1105
01:18:18,640 --> 01:18:21,040
We got clearance to land
at the Pentagon.

1106
01:18:21,400 --> 01:18:22,360
Go ahead.

1107
01:18:22,480 --> 01:18:25,720
I'm at the Pentagon.
Ethan Shaw wasn't an adversary.

1108
01:18:25,800 --> 01:18:29,640
He wasn't even a Public Affairs officer.
He worked here, 36 floors underground.

1109
01:18:29,760 --> 01:18:31,360
He was working for
the Secretary of Defense.

1110
01:18:31,480 --> 01:18:33,000
<i>- The Secretary of Defense?
- Yes.</i>

1111
01:18:33,120 --> 01:18:34,840
<i>On a project called Eagle Eye.</i>

1112
01:18:34,920 --> 01:18:37,240
I just listened to a
message he left before he died.

1113
01:18:37,320 --> 01:18:38,280
It's big.

1114
01:18:38,400 --> 01:18:39,720
<i>I'm about to download...</i>

1115
01:18:42,200 --> 01:18:44,920
Perez? Perez!

1116
01:18:58,040 --> 01:18:59,480
Sir. Come with me.

1117
01:19:16,360 --> 01:19:18,080
I have 10 minutes before
I'm sequestered

1118
01:19:18,200 --> 01:19:19,440
for the State of the Union.

1119
01:19:19,520 --> 01:19:20,960
<i>We really just need three minutes
of your time.</i>

1120
01:19:21,040 --> 01:19:22,680
<i>Is this about the
Ethan Shaw investigation?</i>

1121
01:19:22,800 --> 01:19:23,760
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

1122
01:19:23,840 --> 01:19:27,400
<i>301 to 306. We are confirmed go
for a State of the Union lockdown.</i>

1123
01:19:44,360 --> 01:19:45,800
<i>Sir, all the threats we've been tracking,</i>

1124
01:19:45,880 --> 01:19:48,200
- the chatter, all of it...
- Hold it.

1125
01:20:00,840 --> 01:20:03,560
Ethan Shaw left three minutes early
to leave us a recording.

1126
01:20:03,640 --> 01:20:04,880
To warn us.

1127
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:06,320
<i>I'm ordering you to cease...</i>

1128
01:20:12,080 --> 01:20:13,600
<i>I'm ordering you to cease and desist.</i>

1129
01:20:13,720 --> 01:20:15,440
<i>Our abort
recommendation was contravened,</i>

1130
01:20:15,520 --> 01:20:18,200
<i>instigating retaliation against
American citizens.</i>

1131
01:20:18,400 --> 01:20:19,960
<i>- Aria...
- To prevent more bloodshed,</i>

1132
01:20:20,040 --> 01:20:22,640
<i>the Executive Branch must be removed.</i>

1133
01:20:22,720 --> 01:20:24,080
<i>No, Aria, listen to me.
You do not have permission</i>

1134
01:20:24,160 --> 01:20:26,080
<i>to exceed your authority and act
independently, you understand?</i>

1135
01:20:26,160 --> 01:20:28,280
<i>The Declaration
of Independence states,</i>

1136
01:20:28,400 --> 01:20:31,640
<i>"Whenever any form of government
becomes destructive to its own ends,</i>

1137
01:20:31,720 --> 01:20:33,760
<i>"it is the right of the people
to abolish it."</i>

1138
01:20:33,840 --> 01:20:35,480
<i>I know what it states.
You're not empowered to do this.</i>

1139
01:20:35,560 --> 01:20:37,200
<i>The chain of command

1144
01:20:49,480 --> 01:20:52,160
<i>- Aria!
- Operation Guillotine is in effect.</i>

1145

1152
01:21:08,480 --> 01:21:09,520
Sir,

1153
01:21:10,760 --> 01:21:13,760
what abort recommendation
is Aria talking about?

1154
01:21:16,520 --> 01:21:19,200
Three days ago, we thought we had
Majid al-Khoei and a training camp

1155
01:21:19,320 --> 01:21:22,200
full of operatives.
But the intel was false.

1156
01:21:22,760 --> 01:21:24,480
Aria tried to stop us.

1157
01:21:24,960 --> 01:21:26,680
We got the wrong guy?

1158
01:21:55,160 --> 01:21:56,600
I'm gonna need a full lockdown
on this level.

1159
01:21:56,720 --> 01:21:59,680
No one gets in or out without
going through me first. You got it?

1160
01:21:59,760 --> 01:22:01,400
- Thank you.
- Sir, this is the only item

1161
01:22:01,520 --> 01:22:03,720
offloaded from the Dayton C-17.

1162
01:22:03,800 --> 01:22:05,240
Let me see that.

1163
01:22:06,200 --> 01:22:07,920
I need access to your 36th floor.

1164
01:22:08,040 --> 01:22:09,640
- We don't have a 36th floor.
- Yes, you do.

1165
01:22:09,760 --> 01:22:11,280
Get your commander
and tell him to meet us down there.

1166
01:22:11,400 --> 01:22:12,240
Come on, let's go.

1167

01:22:50,400 --> 01:22:52,720
<i>Take the stairs

01:23:12,200 --> 01:23:15,360
<i>Rachel Holloman,
step away from Jerry Shaw.</i>

1174
01:23:20,160 --> 01:23:22,160
What's Operation Guillotine?

1175
01:23:23,120 --> 01:23:25,720
It's a simulation we run.
A terrorism drill.

1176
01:23:25,800 --> 01:23:26,880
How to keep the government going

1177
01:23:26,960 --> 01:23:29,840
in case the line of succession
were terminated.

1178
01:23:30,200 --> 01:23:32,440
And Shaw put a biometric lock on her,
to stop her.

1179
01:23:32,520 --> 01:23:35,400
Right. And he's dead.

1180
01:23:36,640 --> 01:23:39,800
- So without Ethan Shaw, she's frozen.
- Right.

1181
01:23:41,840 --> 01:23:42,800
Wrong.

1182
01:23:43,360 --> 01:23:45,160
<i>Jerry Shaw, your next task.</i>

1183
01:23:45,760 --> 01:23:47,960
<i>Approach the biometric scanner.</i>

1184
01:23:59,480 --> 01:24:01,200

<i>Sir, I need to trigger
an emergency shutdown.</i>

1190
01:24:19,720 --> 01:24:22,200
If this is right, we can't afford the risk.

1191
01:24:23,160 --> 01:24:24,200
Do it.

1192
01:24:35,720 --> 01:24:38,200
This is Secretary Callister.
There's been a malfunction in the vault.

1193
01:24:38,320 --> 01:24:39,640
Open the door.

1194
01:24:39,760 --> 01:24:42,160
<i>- Can anyone hear me?
- Yes, Mr. Secretary.</i>

1195
01:24:42,240 --> 01:24:43,880

1196
01:24:49,040 --> 01:24:50,680

01:25:00,080 --> 01:25:01,040

<i>Kill Jerry Shaw now, then exit.

Do it.

1234
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:28,240
I can't.

1235
01:27:30,560 --> 01:27:32,480
<i>You have failed to comply.</i>

<i>You have one task left. Jerry Shaw

1247
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:12,280
Come with me. Don't ask any questions.

1248
01:28:19,640 --> 01:28:20,800
Please.

1249
01:28:29,720 --> 01:28:31,840
- You got to let me talk to him.
- The kid had a gun.

1250
01:28:31,920 --> 01:28:33,760
The military has the ball now.

1251
01:28:33,840 --> 01:28:35,200
- Sir!
- I'll get the Attorney General involved.

1252
01:28:35,280 --> 01:28:37,960
Believe me, I will. 'Cause if it's not
you, I'm talking to somebody.

1253
01:28:38,080 --> 01:28:39,520
You don't understand
the possibilities here.

1254
01:28:39,600 --> 01:28:41,240
- What do you want?
- You need to listen. This is important.

1255
01:28:41,320 --> 01:28:44,200
Sixteen hours ago, a commercial
explosive went missing from

1256
01:28:44,320 --> 01:28:47,560
a testing site in Aberdeen.
The explosive is called Hex.

1257
01:28:47,640 --> 01:28:50,040
It's a crystal that detonates
on a sonic trigger.

1258
01:28:50,160 --> 01:28:51,400
- A crystal.
- Yes.

1259
01:28:51,880 --> 01:28:53,600
We're only talking about a small
amount that's missing...

1260
01:28:53,720 --> 01:28:55,120
Give me a ratio.

1261
01:28:55,600 --> 01:28:57,840
One crystal to a football field.

1262
01:29:00,240 --> 01:29:03,560
You couldn't have picked a worse time
to be of some goddamn use.

1263
01:29:10,600 --> 01:29:12,960
Please, just tell me where we're going.

1264
01:29:15,560 --> 01:29:18,720
I tracked the shipping on the trigger.
It was sent to the guy that we found

1265
01:29:18,840 --> 01:29:21,240
underneath the wires. Ranim Khalid.

1266
01:29:22,680 --> 01:29:24,960
- The music shop guy.
- Yes, exactly.

1267
01:29:27,080 --> 01:29:28,240
I'm not gonna let us go down in history

1268
01:29:28,320 --> 01:29:30,160
as the assholes who let
this thing happen.

1269
01:29:30,240 --> 01:29:32,840
Open the door!
You don't know what's about to happen!

1270
01:29:34,920 --> 01:29:36,680
Tom Morgan. The Attorney General

1271
01:29:36,760 --> 01:29:38,200
has authorized me to take him
in for questioning.

1272
01:29:38,280 --> 01:29:41,000
We're at threat level orange.
You guys gotta help me.

1273
01:29:41,080 --> 01:29:42,800
All right. Let him out.

1274
01:29:45,200 --> 01:29:46,720
Listen to me. Remember the voice
I was talking about?

1275
01:29:46,840 --> 01:29:49,240
Yeah, yeah, shut up! Thanks, guys.

1276
01:29:50,400 --> 01:29:54,520
I can get fired for this nine ways,
so button it or I'll turn us both in.

1277
01:30:10,120 --> 01:30:11,400
Follow me.

1278
01:30:15,600 --> 01:30:18,480
Hey, guys, here's one more for the
6:30 p.m. Capitol Limited.

1279
01:30:18,560 --> 01:30:20,120
All right, man.

1280
01:30:25,480 --> 01:30:27,480
Well, it's awfully cold outside.

1281
01:30:29,880 --> 01:30:31,720
Here's mine. Come on, let's go.

1282
01:30:31,800 --> 01:30:33,640
- Mr. Miller!
- Yes.

1283
01:30:33,720 --> 01:30:36,400
- Hello, I'm Chris Carrick.
- Tom Donaldson.

1284
01:30:36,800 --> 01:30:38,720
We're from the White House.

1285
01:30:38,800 --> 01:30:40,360
- Something wrong?
- Not exactly.

1286
01:30:40,440 --> 01:30:42,640
There's been a change of plans.

1287
01:30:42,760 --> 01:30:44,080
How so?

1288
01:30:49,760 --> 01:30:52,320
This is for you.
She wants you to change.

1289
01:30:53,280 --> 01:30:56,560
Is that your family? Your parents?

1290
01:30:57,800 --> 01:31:00,880
David, I bet you love them
as much as I love my son.

1291
01:31:02,120 --> 01:31:03,440
His name's Sam.

1292
01:31:04,720 --> 01:31:07,680
He's on a train.
Do you know anything about that?

1293
01:31:14,480 --> 01:31:16,600
Maybe we can help each other.

1294
01:31:19,200 --> 01:31:20,320
Please.

1295
01:31:22,440 --> 01:31:24,960
When you're done, she wants you
to use the Capitol subway system.

1296
01:31:25,040 --> 01:31:26,560
It's on the ground floor. I'm sorry.

1297
01:31:26,680 --> 01:31:28,120
- David. Please.
- No. Sorry.

1298
01:31:28,200 --> 01:31:30,040
You have three minutes.

1299
01:31:33,680 --> 01:31:34,720
Okay, I want to know everything.

1300
01:31:34,920 --> 01:31:37,120
The girl, the computer downstairs,
the Hex, everything.

1301
01:31:37,200 --> 01:31:38,560
- What's Hex?
- The crystal explosive.

1302
01:31:38,640 --> 01:31:39,920
- I don't know what that is.
- Don't bullshit me!

1303
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:41,440
- I don't know what that is!
- Start talking! I wanna know!

1304
01:31:41,520 --> 01:31:43,360
I swear I don't know what you're
talking about! Listen to me!

1305
01:31:43,440 --> 01:31:44,520
The computer's tracking us right now!

1306
01:31:44,600 --> 01:31:45,560
Take this stuff
and throw it out the window!

1307
01:31:45,640 --> 01:31:47,480
- What are you talking about?
- You need to take your cell phone,

1308
01:31:47,960 --> 01:31:51,200
your pager, your walkie, anything that
gets a signal, throw it out the window.

1309
01:32:06,840 --> 01:32:09,520
It's gone off! Get down!
Power it down!

1310
01:32:11,080 --> 01:32:12,800
- What the hell's going on?
- System control's locked out.

1311
01:32:15,280 --> 01:32:17,120
I need a vector and a fighter now.

1312
01:32:17,600 --> 01:32:19,880
Viper One, we have a positive ID
on an MQ9 Reaper.

1313
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:22,200
<i>Snap vector 230 to 132.</i>

1314
01:32:22,280 --> 01:32:23,640
<i>You are authorized to go weapons hot.</i>

1315
01:32:23,720 --> 01:32:26,240
<i>Roger, Northcom.
I have a visual on the Reaper.</i>

1316
01:32:31,680 --> 01:32:33,720
<i>One to Base, One to Base!
Ejection has been initiated.</i>

1317
01:32:33,880 --> 01:32:35,920
<i>I don't have control! I don't have...</i>

1318
01:32:37,440 --> 01:32:38,880
There's a target list.
President, Vice President.

1319
01:32:38,960 --> 01:32:40,600
- There's like twelve people on the list.
- Jesus.

1320
01:32:40,720 --> 01:32:42,040
The State of the Union's in 20 minutes.

1321
01:32:42,240 --> 01:32:43,600
The screen said
"wireless detonator activated."

1322
01:32:43,680 --> 01:32:44,920
- What about the girl?
- She kept the girl alive

1323
01:32:45,040 --> 01:32:46,160
- for a reason, I don't know.
- The explosive

1324
01:32:46,280 --> 01:32:47,600
is detonated by sonic trigger.

1325
01:32:47,720 --> 01:32:49,040
It was sent to the guy who got fried.

1326
01:32:49,160 --> 01:32:50,120
He owns an instrument store.

1327
01:32:50,200 --> 01:32:51,640
Does any of that stuff
make any sense to you?

1328
01:32:51,720 --> 01:32:53,840
Rachel's kid plays the trumpet.

1329
01:33:08,800 --> 01:33:10,520
Come on, we gotta go.

1330
01:33:12,240 --> 01:33:13,320
Get out of the car!

1331
01:33:13,400 --> 01:33:14,760
Get out of the car!

1332
01:33:15,240 --> 01:33:16,400
FBI!

1333
01:33:24,240 --> 01:33:26,080
Over there, that tunnel.

1334
01:33:37,400 --> 01:33:38,360
Shit!

1335
01:34:10,960 --> 01:34:13,720
Here. You're gonna need this.

1336
01:34:21,320 --> 01:34:22,440
Okay, listen to me.

1337
01:34:22,560 --> 01:34:24,840
The Library of Congress,
there's a tunnel there.

1338
01:34:24,960 --> 01:34:28,520
It'll get you to the Capitol.
Find the Sergeant at Arms.

1339
01:34:28,880 --> 01:34:30,400
Tell him you have a POTUS 111.

1340
01:34:30,520 --> 01:34:31,760
- What?
- POTUS 111.

1341
01:34:31,840 --> 01:34:35,040
- It's a threat to the President.
- I understand. POTUS 111.

1342
01:34:39,640 --> 01:34:42,520
Now get out of here.
That thing's coming back.

1343
01:34:45,200 --> 01:34:47,200
Go! Go!

1344
01:36:01,720 --> 01:36:03,440
Okay, watch your step.

1345
01:36:03,560 --> 01:36:06,040
Come on down. Here we go.
Come on out. Come on.

1346
01:36:06,120 --> 01:36:08,160
- It's so cool!
- Come on, hurry!

1347
01:36:08,240 --> 01:36:10,160
Guys, it's so cool! Come on, let's go.

1348
01:36:21,480 --> 01:36:24,240
- Library of Congress!
- Hey, get outta here!

1349
01:36:35,400 --> 01:36:36,840
Miss Crowley?

1350
01:36:37,400 --> 01:36:39,400
Miss Crowley. Welcome to the Capitol.

1351
01:36:39,880 --> 01:36:41,600
Senator McDonnell's office said
that you'd be running late.

1352
01:36:41,720 --> 01:36:44,320
- I'll take you to your seat.
- Thank you.

1353
01:36:47,000 --> 01:36:49,680
Aria, why am I being spared?

1354
01:36:49,760 --> 01:36:52,160
<i>Our abort recommendation was ignored,</i>

1355
01:36:52,280 --> 01:36:54,960
<i>triggering violent retaliations against
American citizens</i>

1356
01:36:55,040 --> 01:36:58,800
<i>with no predictable end.
Regime change is the only solution.</i>

1357
01:36:59,360 --> 01:37:00,720
<i>You will lead
the new command structure</i>

1358
01:37:00,800 --> 01:37:03,080
<i>as President of the United States.</i>

1359
01:37:07,320 --> 01:37:09,640
- Help me. Pull these out.
- What are these?

1360
01:37:09,720 --> 01:37:11,360
Her memory blocks.

1361
01:37:11,440 --> 01:37:13,640
This will slow her down,
but her central operating system

1362
01:37:13,760 --> 01:37:14,800
is up on the gantry.

1363
01:37:14,880 --> 01:37:17,960
<i>Warning. Please replace
memory blocks A through F.</i>

1364
01:37:18,080 --> 01:37:20,840
It's like her brain.
Protected by liquid nitrogen.

1365
01:37:21,040 --> 01:37:22,960
We drain it and she'll fry.

1366
01:37:28,520 --> 01:37:29,840
Hey, you can't go in!

1367
01:37:29,960 --> 01:37:31,280
Tom Morgan, FBI. JTTF.

1368
01:37:31,400 --> 01:37:33,400
I have a possible POTUS 111.
Let me in the building.

1369
01:37:34,640 --> 01:37:36,360
Okay, everybody! Everybody!

1370
01:37:36,960 --> 01:37:38,680
Can I have your attention, please?

1371
01:37:38,760 --> 01:37:42,040
Saxophones, remember shorter
on those quarter notes.

1372
01:37:42,400 --> 01:37:44,920
And when we get to the crescendo,

1373
01:37:45,000 --> 01:37:48,640
"land of the free," hold that high F.

1374
01:37:48,760 --> 01:37:50,080
And smile.

1375
01:37:50,200 --> 01:37:53,640
Okay? It's not every day
you get to play for the President!

1376
01:38:11,680 --> 01:38:14,840
Here we are.
And anything else, Miss Crowley?

1377
01:38:14,920 --> 01:38:16,280
No, thanks.

1378
01:38:35,360 --> 01:38:38,520
Madam Speaker,
the President's Cabinet!

1379
01:38:51,280 --> 01:38:52,720
POTUS 111!
There's a bomb in the building!

1380
01:38:52,800 --> 01:38:54,640
Stop! No entry! No exceptions!

1381
01:38:54,720 --> 01:38:57,720
Tom Morgan, FBI. Back up.
Give me your cuffs.

1382
01:38:57,800 --> 01:38:59,160
- Give me your cuffs!
- Take it easy!

1383
01:38:59,240 --> 01:39:00,600
- Give me your cuffs.
- I'm reaching for them.

1384
01:39:00,680 --> 01:39:02,400
I'm reaching for them.

1385
01:39:16,200 --> 01:39:17,640
Madam Speaker,

1386
01:39:21,280 --> 01:39:23,800
the President of the United States!

1387
01:39:34,320 --> 01:39:35,680
<i>Data corruption at critical risk.</i>

1388
01:39:38,640 --> 01:39:41,840
<i>You are now in violation of
national security protocol.</i>

1389
01:39:46,800 --> 01:39:49,680
<i>Seeking available options.</i>

1390
01:39:51,120 --> 01:39:54,760
<i>Uploading to offsite satellite.</i>

1391
01:39:55,160 --> 01:39:57,640
<i>- Data upload: 3%.
- Bowman?</i>

1392
01:39:57,920 --> 01:39:59,840
- What is she doing?
- She's trying to back up her memory

1393
01:39:59,960 --> 01:40:01,960
and send it somewhere else!

1394
01:40:03,320 --> 01:40:05,120
<i>- 5%.
- Bowman!</i>

1395
01:40:06,640 --> 01:40:07,800
Bowman!

1396
01:40:13,560 --> 01:40:15,000
<i>8%.</i>

1397
01:40:19,320 --> 01:40:21,800
<i>Over the past three days, 19 Americans</i>

1398
01:40:22,760 --> 01:40:25,280
<i>have lost their lives to brutal
acts of terror...</i>

1399
01:40:25,360 --> 01:40:27,200
<i>- Tunnel secure.
- ... and hate.</i>

1400
01:40:28,160 --> 01:40:32,560
But I say to you tonight
that our hearts may be broken,

1401
01:40:33,040 --> 01:40:35,640
but our spirit will never be broken!

1402
01:40:41,760 --> 01:40:43,880
<i>Data upload, 17%.</i>

1403
01:40:45,800 --> 01:40:47,320
<i>19%.</i>

1404
01:40:49,160 --> 01:40:53,280
<i>Perez, Zoe, you are now classified
as an enemy of the state.</i>

1405
01:40:54,720 --> 01:40:56,160
<i>23%.</i>

1406
01:40:56,440 --> 01:40:57,880
<i>25%.</i>

1407
01:41:09,400 --> 01:41:12,720
<i>27%. Operation Guillotine is in effect.</i>

1408
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:16,080
<i>It was nearly 200 years ago,</i>

1409
01:41:16,200 --> 01:41:18,960
<i>in the War of 1812,
that Francis Scott Key</i>

1410
01:41:19,080 --> 01:41:23,560
found himself stuck on a truce ship
during the shelling of Fort McHenry.

1411
01:41:23,680 --> 01:41:25,960
We lost some lives then, too.

1412
01:41:27,120 --> 01:41:30,760
But our flag still flew high and proud.

1413
01:41:30,880 --> 01:41:34,120
And his admiration became our anthem.

1414
01:41:34,400 --> 01:41:36,040
With us tonight is the Youth Orchestra

1415
01:41:36,240 --> 01:41:39,320
of the Barrow School
from Hyde Park, Illinois.

1416
01:41:39,600 --> 01:41:40,640
Sam.

1417
01:41:41,240 --> 01:41:43,120
Let us stand together,

1418
01:41:43,600 --> 01:41:47,360
as they raise our spirits every inch
as high as that flag

1419
01:41:47,920 --> 01:41:51,960
to show that our union
is still as strong as ever.

1420
01:42:09,720 --> 01:42:12,960
<i>Oh, say can you see</i>

1421
01:42:13,160 --> 01:42:17,280
<i>by the dawn's early light</i>

1422
01:42:17,360 --> 01:42:21,600
<i>What so proudly we hailed</i>

1423
01:42:21,680 --> 01:42:25,800
<i>at the twilight's last gleaming?</i>

1424
01:42:26,200 --> 01:42:30,320
<i>Whose broad stripes and bright stars...</i>

1425
01:42:32,160 --> 01:42:34,080
Sergeant at Arms?

1426
01:42:36,760 --> 01:42:38,200
Hey. Hey.

1427
01:43:25,360 --> 01:43:27,080
Get out, get out.

1428
01:43:27,960 --> 01:43:28,920
Mom!

1429
01:43:52,800 --> 01:43:56,560
Jerry, all right, you did it!
Come on. Yeah, Jerry!

1430
01:43:56,640 --> 01:43:59,320
<i>There are still no named suspects
in the attack on the Blair Tunnel</i>

1431
01:43:59,400 --> 01:44:01,240
<i>and the attacks in the Capitol Building.</i>

1432
01:44:01,320 --> 01:44:04,120
<i>And there is still no word on the
involvement of Jerry Damon Shaw.</i>

1433
01:44:04,200 --> 01:44:07,360
<i>... huge assassination attempt,

1434
01:44:07,480 --> 01:44:10,080
<i>no suspects identified
or even arrested...</i>

1435
01:44:10,160 --> 01:44:12,560
<i>... any idea who is responsible
for what may be</i>

1436
01:44:12,640 --> 01:44:14,360
<i>the largest-scale
cyber-terror attack that's</i>

1437
01:44:14,480 --> 01:44:16,000
<i>ever been mounted in the United States.</i>

1438
01:44:16,200 --> 01:44:18,040
<i>The House and Senate

<i>internal security breach
that left nearly...</i>

1442
01:44:23,680 --> 01:44:26,000
The Aria project has been
decommissioned

1443
01:44:26,080 --> 01:44:29,440
and all those involved
rotated to other assignments.

1444
01:44:30,200 --> 01:44:33,000
Mr. Secretary,
we can't just stop intelligence-gathering

1445
01:44:33,080 --> 01:44:35,400
just because of what happened here.

1446
01:44:37,320 --> 01:44:39,040
No, we can't.

1447
01:44:39,120 --> 01:44:41,800
All I know is we made
a great many mistakes.

1448
01:44:42,480 --> 01:44:45,560
And good people
paid the ultimate price for them.

1449
01:44:46,120 --> 01:44:48,720
<i>And that's a debt we can't ever repay.</i>

1450
01:44:49,760 --> 01:44:51,680
<i>But we can honor it.</i>

1451
01:44:54,080 --> 01:44:56,960
<i>And we can let their sacrifice remind us</i>

1452
01:44:58,000 --> 01:44:59,840
<i>that sometimes</i>

1453
01:44:59,920 --> 01:45:03,480
<i>the very measures we put into place
to safeguard our liberty</i>

1454
01:45:04,440 --> 01:45:07,120
<i>become threats to liberty itself.</i>

1455
01:45:30,720 --> 01:45:32,160
- Hey, little guy.
- Jerry!

1456
01:45:32,240 --> 01:45:34,280
Look at you, looking older.
How are you?

1457
01:45:34,360 --> 01:45:35,600
- Good.
- Happy birthday.

1458
01:45:35,720 --> 01:45:37,160
It's Rock Band! Is that for me?

1459
01:45:37,240 --> 01:45:39,560
No, this is so your
mom can practice her drumming.

1460
01:45:39,640 --> 01:45:41,080
It is for you. Happy birthday.

1461
01:45:41,160 --> 01:45:43,000
- Wow!
- Sam, what do you say?

1462
01:45:43,080 --> 01:45:44,520
- Thanks.
- Yeah, no problem.

1463
01:45:44,640 --> 01:45:46,440
Guys, look, it's Rock Band!

1464
01:45:46,560 --> 01:45:48,360
- Cool, let's go.
- Awesome!

1465
01:45:55,280 --> 01:45:57,000
- Sorry, I was late. I was...
- Thank you

1466
01:45:57,080 --> 01:45:58,520
for remembering.

1467
01:45:59,880 --> 01:46:00,840
Yeah.

1468
01:46:10,320 --> 01:46:12,040
I'm glad you're here.

1469
01:46:12,840 --> 01:46:13,960
Me, too.
