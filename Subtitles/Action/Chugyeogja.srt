Sir, so is that your car?

27
00:03:58,771 --> 00:04:01,331
You bitch,
you're dead if I catch you.

28
00:04:01,474 --> 00:04:04,932
The Chaser

29
00:04:45,351 --> 00:04:46,511
Yes.

30
00:04:47,253 --> 00:04:48,720
Yes.

31
00:04:49,756 --> 00:04:51,018
I'm back!

32
00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:54,021
I'm sorry, sir.

33
00:04:56,963 --> 00:05:00,626
Two of our girls ran away.
Business has been bad lately.

34
00:05:01,267 --> 00:05:05,135
I've already put
such a big advance on those girls.

35
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:12,138
But sir, I can't get that much money
ready in three days.

36
00:05:12,278 --> 00:05:16,044
Once I collect the money from them,
and pay you back...

37
00:05:22,855 --> 00:05:23,617
Turn it off, asshole!

38
00:05:23,756 --> 00:05:26,418
Can't you see
I was on the phone?

39
00:05:29,562 --> 00:05:32,326
You have no fucking manners.

40
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:34,224
Did you hand them out?

41
00:05:34,567 --> 00:05:36,535
- Yes, sir.
- Go hand out some more, idiot!

42
00:05:39,972 --> 00:05:42,338
Dumb asshole.

43
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:52,511
Yes.

44
00:05:53,653 --> 00:05:54,915
Where?

45
00:05:55,755 --> 00:05:57,222
Hapjung district.

00:05:57,757 --> 00:06:01,022
Provence Motel, room 301.

47
00:06:01,861 --> 00:06:03,226
I'll send her now.

48
00:06:12,772 --> 00:06:14,330
- Hello.
- Hey.

49
00:06:14,874 --> 00:06:16,034
You came fast.

50
00:06:25,752 --> 00:06:28,414
Seong-hee,
you don't look so young.

51
00:06:28,554 --> 00:06:31,022
- How old are you?
- Thirty.

52
00:06:31,657 --> 00:06:34,820
You took good care of yourself.
Nice body.

53
00:06:37,063 --> 00:06:38,724
Why? Need to go pee?

54
00:06:39,265 --> 00:06:41,028
- Yes.
- Later.

55
00:06:41,167 --> 00:06:43,931
- No.
- Go later.

56
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:49,439
I told you to go later.

57
00:06:58,851 --> 00:07:00,910
- What's wrong?
- Let go.

58
00:07:01,053 --> 00:07:03,817
- Just wanted to take some pictures.
- Let go!

59
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:06,418
Okay, I'll pay you instead.

60
00:07:06,559 --> 00:07:08,527
Let go, you pervert!

61
00:07:10,363 --> 00:07:11,421
What?

62
00:07:11,564 --> 00:07:13,429
Crazy assholes.

63
00:07:19,472 --> 00:07:20,336
Where is she?

64
00:07:23,576 --> 00:07:25,635
You fucking slut!

65
00:07:25,778 --> 00:07:28,941
You call me a pervert, huh?

66
00:07:29,081 --> 00:07:32,414
Watch your mouth, bitch!

67
00:07:32,552 --> 00:07:35,316
You want to die, huh?

68
00:07:35,655 --> 00:07:37,714
Come here, you bitch!

69
00:07:37,857 --> 00:07:40,519
- Mister.
- You're dead!

70
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:44,118
She's leaving.
Calm down.

71
00:07:44,263 --> 00:07:46,424
- Get out!
- Come here, bitch!

72
00:07:46,566 --> 00:07:47,828
- Mister.
- Come over here!

73
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:49,730
- She's leaving.
- Bitch...

74
00:07:49,869 --> 00:07:53,635
Come here, you bitch!
You're dead!

75
00:07:53,773 --> 00:07:56,241
- She's leaving now.
- You bitch!

76
00:07:56,375 --> 00:07:58,741
- Calm down...
- What the fuck...

77
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:02,745
Who the hell are you?

78
00:08:02,882 --> 00:08:04,611
I'm her guardian, asshole.

79
00:08:16,762 --> 00:08:18,229
Sit down.

80
00:08:19,665 --> 00:08:21,428
Kneel down.

81
00:08:26,873 --> 00:08:28,738
Cover yourself!

82
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:49,618
So what are you going to do?

83
00:08:52,265 --> 00:08:53,732
Let's settle this.

84
00:09:11,450 --> 00:09:12,712
Satisfied?

85
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:21,722
There you are.

86
00:09:21,861 --> 00:09:23,021
Let me see.

87
00:09:25,965 --> 00:09:29,128
I'm quitting for real.
Don't call me.

88
00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:31,937
Hey!

89
00:09:34,073 --> 00:09:35,040
Hey!

90
00:09:39,979 --> 00:09:41,446
Did you find the girls?

91
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:46,616
Where did you find the car?

92
00:09:47,253 --> 00:09:48,311
In Mangwon district.

93
00:09:48,454 --> 00:09:49,716
Did you call the police?

94
00:09:49,855 --> 00:09:51,117
You crazy?

95
00:09:51,257 --> 00:09:52,918
Report girls who
ran away from me?

96
00:09:53,059 --> 00:09:55,323
I told you they didn't run away.

97
00:09:56,062 --> 00:09:58,223
You used to be a detective.

98
00:09:58,364 --> 00:10:01,128
Then go find them
instead of ripping people off.

99
00:10:01,267 --> 00:10:03,735
You crazy bitch,
who says I'm ripping people off?

100
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:06,738
I'm the one
who's being ripped off.

101
00:10:08,174 --> 00:10:11,041
Bitches get a big advance from me
and then disappear.

102
00:10:11,177 --> 00:10:13,543
Ask any asshole on the street
what it means.

103
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:16,344
Whether they've been sold
or ran away.

104
00:10:19,852 --> 00:10:21,513
Rotten bastard.

105
00:10:21,654 --> 00:10:23,019
Hey!

106
00:10:23,155 --> 00:10:26,818
Hey! Seong-hee!

107
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:30,227
That damn temper of hers.

108
00:10:36,469 --> 00:10:38,027
Meathead

109
00:10:40,072 --> 00:10:41,130
What?

110
00:10:41,273 --> 00:10:46,336
This bastard keeps rejecting the girls
and now there's no one left.

111
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:47,844
There's Mi-jin, idiot.

112
00:10:48,381 --> 00:10:50,508
She wants to rest
because she's caught a cold.

113
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:53,710
Cold my ass. I'm hanging up.

114
00:10:54,553 --> 00:10:57,113
What the fuck's wrong
with everyone?

115
00:11:16,776 --> 00:11:17,743
Mom.

116
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:22,338
Mom!

117
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:25,817
What?

118
00:11:25,951 --> 00:11:27,111
Take the medicine.

119
00:11:50,476 --> 00:11:52,239
Bring me my cell phone, honey.

120
00:11:57,950 --> 00:11:59,417
Filth

121
00:12:13,065 --> 00:12:14,032
Yes, Jung-ho.

122
00:12:14,166 --> 00:12:15,428
Where are you?

123
00:12:15,968 --> 00:12:19,028
I'm sorry. I'm very sick.

124
00:12:19,171 --> 00:12:20,638
Where are you sick?

125
00:12:20,773 --> 00:12:22,638
I think it's a cold.
I also have a fever.

126
00:12:23,876 --> 00:12:25,741
I'll take a day off.

127
00:12:25,878 --> 00:12:27,038
A cold?

128
00:12:27,179 --> 00:12:28,942
In the middle of summer?

129
00:12:30,449 --> 00:12:31,507
Are you with a guy?

130
00:12:32,051 --> 00:12:33,313
No.

131
00:12:33,452 --> 00:12:35,420
Are you trying to run away
like the others?

132
00:12:35,855 --> 00:12:37,516
What are you saying?

133
00:12:38,157 --> 00:12:42,617
You better get to work
before you regret it.

134
00:12:43,863 --> 00:12:44,830
Okay?

135
00:12:46,065 --> 00:12:47,327
Why aren't you answering me?

136
00:12:48,367 --> 00:12:49,629
Jung-ho, please.

137
00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:53,136
Where do you live?
I'm going over right now.

138
00:12:55,374 --> 00:12:57,137
Where is it?

139
00:12:59,078 --> 00:13:01,046
Okay, I'll go.

140
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:02,738
Call Meathead.

141
00:13:03,182 --> 00:13:04,206
Yes.

142
00:13:10,756 --> 00:13:12,018
Damn it.

143
00:13:15,161 --> 00:13:16,219
What's this?

144
00:13:25,070 --> 00:13:26,537
You have to go?

145
00:13:28,774 --> 00:13:30,537
I'll be back soon.

146
00:13:36,949 --> 00:13:38,314
Yes, a Matiz.

147
00:13:39,552 --> 00:13:43,215
I'm wearing a white cardigan
over a dress.

148
00:14:07,379 --> 00:14:08,641
Did it turn on?

149
00:14:08,781 --> 00:14:09,907
Yes.

150
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:22,625
4885?

151
00:14:24,763 --> 00:14:26,025
4885...

152
00:14:28,067 --> 00:14:29,534
I've heard of it.

153
00:14:30,769 --> 00:14:32,327
4885?

154
00:14:32,471 --> 00:14:33,335
Know this number?

155
00:14:33,472 --> 00:14:34,734
Yes, sir.

156
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:36,842
He's a complete wacko.

157
00:14:37,576 --> 00:14:40,044
Mi-jin went to serve
that bastard.

158
00:14:40,479 --> 00:14:41,741
Ji-young

159
00:14:47,553 --> 00:14:49,214
Mi-jin

160
00:14:50,256 --> 00:14:51,621
Shit.

161
00:14:55,261 --> 00:14:56,228
Where did she go?

162
00:14:56,362 --> 00:14:57,226
To Mangwon district.

163
00:14:57,363 --> 00:15:00,821
Yeah, it's that bastard.
He sold them.

164
00:15:00,966 --> 00:15:03,127
It's me.
Just answer yes or no.

165
00:15:03,269 --> 00:15:05,032
Are you with
that bastard now?

166
00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:06,535
Your customer.

167
00:15:06,672 --> 00:15:08,537
At a motel or his home?

168
00:15:08,674 --> 00:15:10,835
Are you going to his house
in your car?

169
00:15:10,976 --> 00:15:12,238
Okay, listen carefully.

170
00:15:12,378 --> 00:15:15,142
Memorize his address
as you go into his house.

171
00:15:15,281 --> 00:15:17,613
Just do as I say.

172
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:19,411
Don't get me upset.

173
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:22,418
Soon as you go in,
tell him you'll take a shower.

174
00:15:22,554 --> 00:15:25,921
Then text me his address.
Simple, right?

175
00:15:26,058 --> 00:15:26,922
Don't let him be suspicious.

176
00:15:27,059 --> 00:15:29,323
You die if you screw up.

177
00:15:31,463 --> 00:15:32,725
I'm finally lucky.

178
00:15:32,865 --> 00:15:34,025
Shouldn't we report it?

179
00:15:34,166 --> 00:15:36,031
Want to see
this business go down?

180
00:15:36,568 --> 00:15:38,035
Look after the office.

181
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:39,635
Yes, sir.

182
00:15:44,076 --> 00:15:45,634
Who is it?

183
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:47,541
My manager.

184
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,004
Your boss?

185
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:52,913
Yes.

186
00:15:55,354 --> 00:15:56,719
Something wrong?

187
00:15:57,056 --> 00:15:59,923
No, he's worried
that I'm sick.

188
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:02,821
Which way shall I go?

189
00:16:03,362 --> 00:16:06,024
Over there.
Park in front of the guard post.

190
00:16:25,651 --> 00:16:27,619
What a tough life.

191
00:16:27,953 --> 00:16:30,319
The mayor of Seoul.

192
00:16:30,456 --> 00:16:32,822
At the market at this hour.

193
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:38,630
Jung-ho, what's up?

194
00:16:38,764 --> 00:16:39,924
Gil-woo, are you busy?

195
00:16:40,065 --> 00:16:42,329
I'm busy, why?

196
00:16:42,468 --> 00:16:44,231
Remember what I told you?

197
00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:46,838
- What?
- About my girls running away.

198
00:16:46,972 --> 00:16:49,941
They didn't run away.
They've been sold.

199
00:16:50,075 --> 00:16:52,236
The same guy called for
the girls.

200
00:16:52,378 --> 00:16:54,938
So?
Going to catch that asshole?

201
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:56,809
- Yes.
- Where are you?

202
00:16:56,949 --> 00:16:59,008
Mangwon district.
Are you busy now?

203
00:16:59,151 --> 00:17:02,018
I told you I'm busy.

204
00:17:02,154 --> 00:17:04,019
I don't know
how many of them there are.

205
00:17:04,156 --> 00:17:05,817
I might be outnumbered.

206
00:17:05,958 --> 00:17:08,222
Could you send
a few ofyour guys at least?

207
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:10,328
History will be the judge!

208
00:17:11,263 --> 00:17:13,925
Get the hell out!

209
00:17:18,170 --> 00:17:20,138
Gil-woo?

210
00:17:20,272 --> 00:17:21,432
Damn it.

211
00:17:26,979 --> 00:17:28,139
It's here.

212
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:34,417
Mangwon district, 24-1

213
00:17:54,773 --> 00:17:55,831
Something wrong?

214
00:17:56,775 --> 00:17:57,935
No.

215
00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:06,117
Come in.

216
00:18:07,453 --> 00:18:08,511
Okay.

217
00:18:49,161 --> 00:18:51,527
- Coming?
- Yes.

218
00:19:36,875 --> 00:19:38,433
I'll take a shower.

219
00:19:39,678 --> 00:19:41,737
Sure, it's over there.

220
00:19:59,464 --> 00:20:00,829
Mangwon district

221
00:20:03,569 --> 00:20:04,934
Sending

222
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:17,007
Message failed

223
00:21:33,358 --> 00:21:36,623
I think I left the condom in my car.
I'll be right back.

224
00:21:40,065 --> 00:21:41,032
Okay.

225
00:22:12,364 --> 00:22:13,331
Mi-jin

226
00:22:17,369 --> 00:22:19,929
Your call cannot be connected.

227
00:22:20,072 --> 00:22:21,437
Damn it.

228
00:22:23,275 --> 00:22:23,934
Mi-jin

229
00:22:26,378 --> 00:22:27,743
- Your call cannot be connected.
- What the...

230
00:23:26,972 --> 00:23:28,439
Hey.

231
00:23:31,176 --> 00:23:32,336
Do you know Ji-young?

232
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:36,911
Haven't seen her for a while,
have you?

233
00:23:40,252 --> 00:23:43,016
Hush, hush.

234
00:23:43,555 --> 00:23:45,716
She kept screaming,
so I cut off her tongue.

235
00:23:56,768 --> 00:23:58,235
Good.

236
00:24:00,272 --> 00:24:01,637
Mi-jin.

237
00:24:02,574 --> 00:24:03,836
Scared?

238
00:24:06,178 --> 00:24:07,736
Do you want to go home?

239
00:24:11,349 --> 00:24:13,010
Why do you
want to go home?

240
00:24:15,954 --> 00:24:18,013
Tell me why you should live.

241
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:23,022
No reason?

242
00:24:24,162 --> 00:24:25,925
Spare me.

243
00:24:26,064 --> 00:24:27,531
Please let me live!

244
00:24:28,767 --> 00:24:30,234
No reason, right?

245
00:24:30,569 --> 00:24:33,129
Wait! I have one!

246
00:24:33,772 --> 00:24:35,535
I have a daughter.

247
00:24:36,975 --> 00:24:39,842
She's seven years old.

248
00:24:45,050 --> 00:24:47,211
Nobody would even know
that you're dead.

249
00:24:48,954 --> 00:24:50,615
Nobody will look for you.

250
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:57,428
Don't move.

251
00:24:57,863 --> 00:24:59,421
Don't move.

252
00:24:59,564 --> 00:25:01,828
It won't hurt at all.
None of them felt any pain.

253
00:25:03,468 --> 00:25:05,231
It hurts if you move around.

254
00:25:11,776 --> 00:25:13,141
Damn it.

255
00:25:15,881 --> 00:25:19,510
9256-4885

256
00:25:25,957 --> 00:25:27,515
Your call cannot be connected.

257
00:25:34,666 --> 00:25:36,531
Damn it.

258
00:26:25,951 --> 00:26:28,215
Damn it.

259
00:27:05,156 --> 00:27:06,521
Who is it?

260
00:27:07,559 --> 00:27:09,424
Sorry to disturb you so late.

261
00:27:09,561 --> 00:27:11,620
Is Mr. Park home?

262
00:27:11,763 --> 00:27:13,025
Who are you people?

263
00:27:13,164 --> 00:27:14,927
Please leave

264
00:27:15,767 --> 00:27:17,234
There's no one
by that name here.

265
00:27:18,770 --> 00:27:22,035
Mr. Park hasn't come
to church lately.

266
00:27:22,173 --> 00:27:23,834
There's no sign of him.

267
00:27:26,177 --> 00:27:27,838
There's no such person here.

268
00:27:29,581 --> 00:27:31,515
Then did he move?

269
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:32,912
I don't know.

270
00:27:36,655 --> 00:27:38,919
Oh, goodness, it's Pungsan.

271
00:27:39,357 --> 00:27:41,222
- Honey, isn't that Pungsan?
- You're right.

272
00:27:41,359 --> 00:27:43,122
How'd you get so skinny?

273
00:27:43,261 --> 00:27:44,319
Let's go.

274
00:27:44,462 --> 00:27:45,929
Wait a minute. Look at her.

275
00:27:46,064 --> 00:27:47,725
Why are you being
so stubborn?

276
00:27:48,767 --> 00:27:50,928
- Pungsan!
- I'm sorry to disturb you.

277
00:27:51,069 --> 00:27:53,128
Let's go.

278
00:27:54,472 --> 00:27:56,133
Something's not right.

279
00:27:56,574 --> 00:27:58,542
Wait a minute.

280
00:28:03,648 --> 00:28:05,013
Sorry.

281
00:28:05,750 --> 00:28:08,218
Actually, he's sleeping.

282
00:28:10,655 --> 00:28:11,917
Come inside.

283
00:28:14,659 --> 00:28:17,219
- Do you live around here?
- Yes.

284
00:28:17,362 --> 00:28:22,129
Have you seen a guy and a girl
with long hair and a pale face?

285
00:28:22,267 --> 00:28:23,131
No, I haven't.

286
00:28:23,268 --> 00:28:24,633
- They were just here.
- Sorry.

287
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:38,213
Why do you keep on
bothering me?

288
00:29:10,849 --> 00:29:12,214
Damn it.

289
00:29:28,166 --> 00:29:31,135
Fuck.

290
00:29:54,359 --> 00:29:55,724
I'm busy so just give me
your number.

291
00:29:55,860 --> 00:29:57,225
The insurance will cover it.

292
00:29:58,563 --> 00:30:01,930
I said
just give me your number.

293
00:30:02,567 --> 00:30:03,625
Forget it. Just go.

294
00:30:04,068 --> 00:30:05,126
What?

295
00:30:06,070 --> 00:30:07,935
It's all right. Just leave.

296
00:30:10,175 --> 00:30:12,735
Don't lay one on me later.
Just give me your number.

297
00:30:12,877 --> 00:30:13,935
Mister!

298
00:30:15,180 --> 00:30:17,011
I'm all right, okay?

299
00:30:28,059 --> 00:30:29,617
Sir.

300
00:30:30,061 --> 00:30:32,928
I made a mistake,
so I should make up for it.

301
00:30:33,064 --> 00:30:34,224
It's okay.

302
00:30:35,767 --> 00:30:39,828
Give me your number.
I'll take care of it, okay?

303
00:30:40,972 --> 00:30:42,337
I said it's all right.

304
00:30:46,878 --> 00:30:49,540
I'm really okay,
so can you move your car?

305
00:30:49,681 --> 00:30:50,705
You don't have to pay me.

306
00:30:50,849 --> 00:30:53,909
No, give me your number.
I'll pay for the damage.

307
00:30:56,454 --> 00:30:57,921
You're hurt.

308
00:30:58,456 --> 00:31:00,014
Isn't that blood?

309
00:31:00,658 --> 00:31:02,125
What are you talking about?

310
00:31:07,565 --> 00:31:09,726
Move your car!

311
00:31:10,268 --> 00:31:14,034
I said move your car!
Are you deaf?

312
00:31:14,172 --> 00:31:17,232
Lady, move your damn car!

313
00:31:17,375 --> 00:31:18,637
Pull out!

314
00:31:19,177 --> 00:31:20,940
- Pull out!
- Hey, 4885.

315
00:31:23,748 --> 00:31:24,715
It's you, huh?

316
00:31:29,654 --> 00:31:31,918
Oh, brother.

317
00:31:32,757 --> 00:31:34,122
Son of a bitch.

318
00:31:42,166 --> 00:31:43,531
Answer it, asshole.

319
00:31:49,173 --> 00:31:52,939
You're dead meat.

320
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:56,438
Get out.

321
00:32:20,371 --> 00:32:22,134
Hey! You!

322
00:32:23,775 --> 00:32:24,742
Hey!

323
00:32:30,448 --> 00:32:31,608
Son of a bitch.

324
00:32:37,255 --> 00:32:40,418
Stop, you son of a bitch!

325
00:32:49,567 --> 00:32:51,228
Wait till I catch you.

326
00:34:32,570 --> 00:34:33,832
Son of a bitch.

327
00:34:35,973 --> 00:34:37,531
Why are you running away?

328
00:34:38,976 --> 00:34:40,341
Think you'd get away?

329
00:34:45,049 --> 00:34:46,914
Asshole,
what did you do with my girls?

330
00:34:47,952 --> 00:34:49,510
You already sold them?

331
00:34:50,455 --> 00:34:52,821
Asshole, who the hell are you?

332
00:35:06,104 --> 00:35:07,366
Ji Young-min
Anyang city

333
00:35:07,472 --> 00:35:08,734
What the hell?

334
00:35:10,475 --> 00:35:13,239
Where's your house?

335
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:16,704
Answer me.

336
00:35:16,848 --> 00:35:18,213
Answer me now.

337
00:35:19,050 --> 00:35:20,415
Anyang city.

338
00:35:20,551 --> 00:35:25,614
That's your address on paper.
Where do you live now?

339
00:35:26,257 --> 00:35:28,521
Not talking? You block me?

340
00:35:28,659 --> 00:35:30,217
You son of a bitch.

341
00:35:31,062 --> 00:35:33,121
You pain in the ass.

342
00:35:33,764 --> 00:35:35,925
- Move, now!
- Move your car back!

343
00:35:36,067 --> 00:35:37,625
Come here.

344
00:35:39,170 --> 00:35:40,637
Bastards.

345
00:35:40,771 --> 00:35:43,433
You caused this mess,
asshole!

346
00:35:44,075 --> 00:35:45,133
Move.

347
00:35:45,977 --> 00:35:47,239
Out of the way.

348
00:35:47,478 --> 00:35:49,343
- Hey, Miss!
- What kind of person did do that...

349
00:35:51,048 --> 00:35:52,515
Move.
Out of the way.

350
00:35:53,751 --> 00:35:56,219
What are you doing?
Get out!

351
00:35:57,755 --> 00:35:59,723
Get in the car.

352
00:36:00,558 --> 00:36:02,822
If there's an accident,
you should go around.

353
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:04,518
This won't solve anything.

354
00:36:05,463 --> 00:36:06,930
Move your car.

355
00:36:07,365 --> 00:36:09,833
Reverse!
Move back!

356
00:36:09,967 --> 00:36:10,934
Sir!

357
00:36:11,469 --> 00:36:12,731
Hey, you!

358
00:36:13,871 --> 00:36:16,135
You can't park like this.

359
00:36:16,474 --> 00:36:17,634
Is that your car?

360
00:36:18,276 --> 00:36:19,436
Yes.

361
00:36:23,848 --> 00:36:25,315
Are you a cop?

362
00:36:26,951 --> 00:36:28,316
Yes, I am.

363
00:36:28,452 --> 00:36:31,319
Show me your badge.

364
00:36:31,455 --> 00:36:34,913
I left it at the police station.

365
00:36:37,161 --> 00:36:38,822
This is 390.

366
00:36:38,963 --> 00:36:40,624
Come in Mangwon station.

367
00:36:40,765 --> 00:36:42,130
ID check.

368
00:36:43,267 --> 00:36:44,825
What station do you work at?

369
00:36:44,969 --> 00:36:47,529
I was in a task force unit
two years ago.

370
00:36:47,672 --> 00:36:49,139
Let's call them.

371
00:36:49,273 --> 00:36:50,638
Let's go to the station first.

372
00:36:50,775 --> 00:36:53,141
But my girls are being sold
this very moment.

373
00:36:53,277 --> 00:36:55,745
Shut up! Let's go and talk!

374
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:57,506
You son of a bitch.

375
00:36:57,648 --> 00:36:59,513
I told you to shut up!

376
00:37:07,158 --> 00:37:08,318
Damn it.

377
00:37:08,659 --> 00:37:10,024
No answer?

378
00:37:12,563 --> 00:37:16,329
No cell phone, either.
Nothing he says makes sense.

379
00:37:16,467 --> 00:37:18,935
All we need to do
is go to his house.

380
00:37:19,770 --> 00:37:22,136
Please write it all down,
frankly.

381
00:37:22,273 --> 00:37:23,433
Yes, sir.

382
00:37:23,574 --> 00:37:27,032
People like him need to be deported.
How dare you impersonate a cop!

383
00:37:27,178 --> 00:37:30,409
Asshole, tell the truth.
Where did you sell the girls?

384
00:37:30,548 --> 00:37:31,708
Be quiet!

385
00:37:31,849 --> 00:37:32,907
Why are you shouting?

386
00:37:33,050 --> 00:37:34,813
Ask that bastard directly.

387
00:37:34,952 --> 00:37:36,317
You're out of line.

388
00:37:36,454 --> 00:37:38,513
Ask him!
Don't just get on my case!

389
00:37:39,557 --> 00:37:40,717
You really sold them?

390
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:43,418
Are you crazy?

391
00:37:43,561 --> 00:37:45,825
Sorry.
He just wanted me to ask.

392
00:37:46,364 --> 00:37:47,922
This is fucking insane.

393
00:37:49,367 --> 00:37:51,335
Block them, idiot!

394
00:37:51,669 --> 00:37:53,637
Be quiet!

395
00:37:54,472 --> 00:37:55,530
Which hospital?

396
00:37:55,673 --> 00:37:57,834
St. Mary's Hospital.
I'll call you from there.

397
00:37:58,576 --> 00:38:01,545
Why'd you throw shit on
his face, you crazy bastard?

398
00:38:03,748 --> 00:38:05,716
Yes, Captain.
I'm on my way now.

399
00:38:05,850 --> 00:38:08,114
How can I stop someone
who pops up out of nowhere?

400
00:38:08,653 --> 00:38:11,520
Hey, cover the seat first
before he gets in.

401
00:38:12,356 --> 00:38:14,017
Yes, the rest went to
the hospital.

402
00:38:14,759 --> 00:38:17,922
Yes, I'll bring him in first.

403
00:38:20,665 --> 00:38:23,327
Mr. Ji Young-min,
whose car is that?

404
00:38:23,968 --> 00:38:26,027
- Pardon? Car?
- Yes.

405
00:38:28,172 --> 00:38:29,730
It belongs to someone I know.

406
00:38:30,274 --> 00:38:31,741
Who is that person you know?

407
00:38:31,876 --> 00:38:32,934
What?

408
00:38:33,778 --> 00:38:35,439
What's his name?

409
00:38:35,579 --> 00:38:37,706
I can't remember.

410
00:38:37,848 --> 00:38:39,315
Do you know his number?

411
00:38:40,351 --> 00:38:41,909
It's at home.

412
00:38:47,958 --> 00:38:49,323
Something wrong?

413
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:52,620
No, it's strange you don't know
the car owner.

414
00:38:54,865 --> 00:38:57,026
I have a very bad memory.

415
00:38:57,168 --> 00:38:59,329
Okay, just keep writing.

416
00:39:07,778 --> 00:39:10,508
Mr. Ji, does your number
start with 01 1 or 01 6?

417
00:39:10,648 --> 00:39:11,808
01 6

418
00:39:14,051 --> 00:39:15,916
I thought
you didn't have a phone.

419
00:39:16,854 --> 00:39:17,912
What?

420
00:39:18,255 --> 00:39:19,813
Where's your cell phone?

421
00:39:20,758 --> 00:39:21,816
At home.

422
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:23,725
Then why did you lie?

423
00:39:24,962 --> 00:39:26,327
Tell me your number.

424
00:39:28,666 --> 00:39:30,224
It's 4885, right?

425
00:39:30,668 --> 00:39:31,532
No.

426
00:39:31,669 --> 00:39:34,229
Come on, I can find out easily.

427
00:39:38,776 --> 00:39:40,141
Did you sell the girls?

428
00:39:40,277 --> 00:39:41,642
No.

429
00:39:41,779 --> 00:39:44,304
Come on,
did you sell the girls?

430
00:39:45,049 --> 00:39:46,607
I said no.

431
00:39:47,651 --> 00:39:49,312
I didn't sell them.

432
00:39:50,454 --> 00:39:52,012
- I killed them...
- What?

433
00:39:52,556 --> 00:39:54,717
- Nothing.
- You just said something.

434
00:39:54,859 --> 00:39:56,918
- What?
- You said that you killed them.

435
00:39:59,663 --> 00:40:00,925
Yes.

436
00:40:01,265 --> 00:40:02,425
What?

437
00:40:03,768 --> 00:40:06,134
Yes, I killed them.

438
00:40:15,980 --> 00:40:17,208
Whose shit is it?
Is it yours?

439
00:40:17,348 --> 00:40:19,509
History will be the judge of things!
Damn you all!

440
00:40:19,650 --> 00:40:22,414
- Crazy asshole.
- What a crazy...

441
00:40:23,053 --> 00:40:25,317
We're in deep trouble for this.

442
00:40:25,456 --> 00:40:26,923
This is crazy.

443
00:40:27,057 --> 00:40:28,422
I've been suffering.

444
00:40:28,559 --> 00:40:31,119
They've stopped the water supply
and I haven't washed for ages.

445
00:40:31,262 --> 00:40:33,127
Jung-ho
I can't even flush
my own shit.

446
00:40:33,264 --> 00:40:35,232
Shut the hell up!

447
00:40:35,866 --> 00:40:37,026
Be quiet.

448
00:40:40,070 --> 00:40:41,230
What?

449
00:40:41,672 --> 00:40:42,934
I'm busy now.

450
00:40:43,374 --> 00:40:46,639
What are you talking about?

451
00:40:47,077 --> 00:40:49,637
How do you know
whether he killed them or not?

452
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:51,008
Anyway...

453
00:40:51,549 --> 00:40:52,607
Yes.

454
00:40:53,250 --> 00:40:54,410
Nine of them?

455
00:40:56,253 --> 00:40:57,811
He said he killed nine people?

456
00:40:58,556 --> 00:41:00,717
Hey, Jung-ho.

457
00:41:01,559 --> 00:41:03,220
Bastard.

458
00:41:06,263 --> 00:41:08,128
That Son of...

459
00:41:11,769 --> 00:41:12,633
Detective Oh.

460
00:41:12,770 --> 00:41:13,737
Yes?

461
00:41:15,072 --> 00:41:16,835
Remember
the Mapo murder case?

462
00:41:16,974 --> 00:41:20,034
- Three murdered women?
- Yeah.

463
00:41:20,177 --> 00:41:22,441
How many occurred
in Mangwon district?

464
00:41:22,780 --> 00:41:24,407
All of them happened
in Mangwon.

465
00:41:24,849 --> 00:41:25,907
In the ally at dawn.

466
00:41:26,851 --> 00:41:27,909
Really?

467
00:41:29,854 --> 00:41:30,912
Why?

468
00:41:32,456 --> 00:41:33,616
Never mind.

469
00:41:39,964 --> 00:41:41,226
What shall we do?

470
00:41:42,266 --> 00:41:43,631
Let's take him in first.

471
00:41:43,767 --> 00:41:45,428
His statement makes sense.

472
00:41:46,270 --> 00:41:47,237
It does, doesn't it?

473
00:41:47,371 --> 00:41:49,532
Bunch of idiots wasting time.

474
00:41:49,673 --> 00:41:52,039
What did you say?

475
00:41:52,376 --> 00:41:53,536
You're way out of line.

476
00:41:53,677 --> 00:41:54,541
Watch what you say.

477
00:41:54,678 --> 00:41:56,805
He's pretending to
be crazy now.

478
00:41:56,947 --> 00:41:58,107
Hey!

479
00:41:58,249 --> 00:41:59,910
Shut up, you pimp.

480
00:42:00,050 --> 00:42:02,610
You're worse than
this asshole.

481
00:42:02,753 --> 00:42:06,211
You sell out your old police badge
to pimp girls.

482
00:42:06,357 --> 00:42:07,221
Take him to the car.

483
00:42:07,358 --> 00:42:08,916
- Yes?
- Put him in the car!

484
00:42:09,059 --> 00:42:09,923
Yes, sir!

485
00:42:10,060 --> 00:42:13,325
We're not taking the blame
for him beating this guy up.

486
00:42:14,565 --> 00:42:16,032
Let's not be like this, okay?

487
00:42:16,166 --> 00:42:18,726
Let's go.
Hurry up.

488
00:42:20,871 --> 00:42:21,633
Hello.

489
00:42:21,772 --> 00:42:22,932
Gil-woo!

490
00:42:23,073 --> 00:42:24,233
Where are you going?

491
00:42:24,375 --> 00:42:25,342
Those idiots are holding him.

492
00:42:25,476 --> 00:42:26,738
- And just...
- Hold on.

493
00:42:27,778 --> 00:42:29,143
Can I help you?

494
00:42:30,047 --> 00:42:31,514
I'm from the Task Force Unit.

495
00:42:32,049 --> 00:42:33,107
Where?

496
00:42:33,250 --> 00:42:35,013
The Task Force Unit
at the Seoul station.

497
00:42:35,152 --> 00:42:36,813
You must've come
for the Mapo case files.

498
00:42:36,954 --> 00:42:39,616
No, I came for that guy.

499
00:42:40,157 --> 00:42:41,124
What?

500
00:42:41,258 --> 00:42:42,418
I'm taking him in.

501
00:43:00,077 --> 00:43:01,544
Sorry to wake you up, sir.

502
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:03,608
What is this all about?

503
00:43:03,747 --> 00:43:05,806
It's a bit complicated.

504
00:43:05,950 --> 00:43:07,417
Damn it!

505
00:43:07,551 --> 00:43:08,711
Who is this?

506
00:43:09,153 --> 00:43:10,620
Yes, this man is...

507
00:43:10,754 --> 00:43:12,016
Is he the shit thrower?

508
00:43:12,156 --> 00:43:13,521
Yes, I believe so.

509
00:43:13,657 --> 00:43:16,421
Crazy bastard,
why'd you throw shit at someone?

510
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:18,528
What is he saying?

511
00:43:18,662 --> 00:43:22,530
Looks like he has to urinate.
Would you like to talk to him?

512
00:43:22,666 --> 00:43:23,928
Forget it.

513
00:43:24,868 --> 00:43:26,233
So are you sure about this?

514
00:43:26,370 --> 00:43:27,428
Yes, Gil-woo is.

515
00:43:27,571 --> 00:43:29,436
Don't use him as an excuse.

516
00:43:29,773 --> 00:43:32,139
- Sorry, sir.
- Okay.

517
00:43:32,276 --> 00:43:33,243
You son of bitch!

518
00:43:34,878 --> 00:43:36,140
Why is it so noisy in here!

519
00:43:38,349 --> 00:43:39,714
Sir!

520
00:43:40,351 --> 00:43:42,819
Crazy bastards.

521
00:43:43,654 --> 00:43:44,916
Who's Ji Young-min?

522
00:43:48,859 --> 00:43:50,326
Are you Ji Young-min?

523
00:43:51,161 --> 00:43:52,423
Yes.

524
00:43:52,563 --> 00:43:53,928
What happened to your face?

525
00:43:57,167 --> 00:43:59,931
Are you all out of your minds?

526
00:44:00,070 --> 00:44:02,937
Sir, we didn't do anything.

527
00:44:03,073 --> 00:44:04,438
Shut up!

528
00:44:06,677 --> 00:44:08,042
Come outside.

529
00:44:08,779 --> 00:44:10,303
Come out now!

530
00:44:16,553 --> 00:44:19,818
- Have a good life.
- Let me loose.

531
00:44:20,858 --> 00:44:22,325
Who beat him?

532
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:24,728
- Well...
- They did it?

533
00:44:25,663 --> 00:44:27,528
- I don't know, sir.
- Find out who beat him

534
00:44:27,665 --> 00:44:29,929
and then bring him in.

535
00:44:30,267 --> 00:44:31,234
Yes, sir!

536
00:44:31,568 --> 00:44:33,331
- You know the situation we're in?
- Yes, sir.

537
00:44:33,470 --> 00:44:35,028
We're all dead if this case fails.

538
00:44:35,172 --> 00:44:36,230
Yes, sir.

539
00:44:41,278 --> 00:44:42,745
Who did this to you?

540
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:44,211
That guy inside.

541
00:44:44,348 --> 00:44:45,815
- Who?
- Hey!

542
00:44:45,949 --> 00:44:48,713
There's more than
one in there!

543
00:44:49,153 --> 00:44:50,211
That man over there.

544
00:44:50,354 --> 00:44:52,322
Come here,
you son of a bitch.

545
00:44:52,456 --> 00:44:55,016
You lie to all of them?

546
00:44:55,159 --> 00:44:55,921
You son of a bitch!

547
00:44:56,060 --> 00:44:58,119
- Chill.
- That little...!

548
00:44:58,262 --> 00:45:00,127
Cut it out.
Let's go to the station first.

549
00:45:00,264 --> 00:45:02,425
Jung-ho, you can do it there.

550
00:45:02,566 --> 00:45:05,034
Right, let's go.

551
00:45:05,169 --> 00:45:06,932
Gil-woo, come here.

552
00:45:07,471 --> 00:45:09,336
Let's go and do it, okay?

553
00:45:10,374 --> 00:45:12,035
You're sure about this, right?

554
00:45:12,176 --> 00:45:13,143
Yes, I'm sure.

555
00:45:13,277 --> 00:45:14,835
- Absolutely sure?
- Yes, I am.

556
00:45:14,978 --> 00:45:16,445
Okay, let's go.

557
00:45:19,550 --> 00:45:20,812
- Let's go.
- Okay.

558
00:45:21,552 --> 00:45:23,110
- Wait! Stop!
- Why?

559
00:45:23,253 --> 00:45:24,117
Where'd that bastard go?

560
00:45:24,254 --> 00:45:26,017
- Who?
- Jung-ho.

561
00:45:26,156 --> 00:45:27,418
Damn it.

562
00:45:32,963 --> 00:45:34,123
There's that bastard.

563
00:45:34,264 --> 00:45:36,027
Hey!

564
00:45:36,166 --> 00:45:37,326
Come to the office!

565
00:45:37,468 --> 00:45:39,436
- Okay.
- You better come!

566
00:45:39,570 --> 00:45:40,832
Okay!

567
00:46:08,866 --> 00:46:10,026
Owner:Kwon Hae-gab

568
00:46:11,368 --> 00:46:13,029
Damn bastard.

569
00:46:48,772 --> 00:46:50,137
Hey.

570
00:46:51,074 --> 00:46:52,439
Hey!

571
00:46:54,678 --> 00:46:56,612
- Me?
- Yeah, you.

572
00:46:56,747 --> 00:46:58,112
What did you kill the girls with?

573
00:46:59,449 --> 00:47:00,814
With a chisel.

574
00:47:01,251 --> 00:47:02,912
The ones to crack stones?

575
00:47:03,253 --> 00:47:04,220
Yes.

576
00:47:04,655 --> 00:47:06,316
- Is that right?
- Yes,

577
00:47:06,456 --> 00:47:07,923
it was a narrow
blunt instrument.

578
00:47:09,660 --> 00:47:11,127
Okay.

579
00:47:11,662 --> 00:47:15,223
I need to pee really bad.
Let me out.

580
00:47:15,365 --> 00:47:17,333
Shut up.

581
00:47:17,467 --> 00:47:20,334
Or else I'll yank your dick out.

582
00:47:21,071 --> 00:47:22,231
Detective.

583
00:47:22,372 --> 00:47:23,737
What?

584
00:47:24,875 --> 00:47:27,435
Kim Mi-jin is probably still alive.

585
00:47:28,378 --> 00:47:29,845
What's he talking about?

586
00:47:29,947 --> 00:47:31,312
Kim Mi-jin.

587
00:47:31,949 --> 00:47:34,008
The girl that guy was looking for.

588
00:47:34,151 --> 00:47:35,413
Where is she now?

589
00:47:35,552 --> 00:47:36,917
In Anyang city?

590
00:47:38,455 --> 00:47:39,717
Why?

591
00:47:41,458 --> 00:47:44,325
Why would the victim be there?

592
00:47:45,963 --> 00:47:48,431
Wait, stop the car.

593
00:47:48,565 --> 00:47:52,023
That's just his address on paper.
He lives in Mangwon district.

594
00:47:52,469 --> 00:47:54,733
That's where I caught him.

595
00:47:56,673 --> 00:47:59,437
Bastard hangs up the phone
before I'm finished.

596
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:03,608
Car registration

597
00:48:27,771 --> 00:48:29,136
Who is it?

598
00:48:31,475 --> 00:48:32,635
Do you know this man?

599
00:48:34,278 --> 00:48:35,245
No.

600
00:48:35,879 --> 00:48:37,312
These keys?

601
00:48:37,648 --> 00:48:39,013
I don't know.

602
00:48:39,149 --> 00:48:40,707
Look carefully.

603
00:48:40,851 --> 00:48:42,409
It's the first time I've seen it.

604
00:48:45,756 --> 00:48:47,519
Where did they go?

605
00:48:47,658 --> 00:48:51,025
They were going to some meeting,
but I don't remember.

606
00:48:51,962 --> 00:48:53,122
Yanpyung 11a.m.
Yangpyung?

607
00:48:53,263 --> 00:48:55,322
Yes, I think so.

608
00:48:57,668 --> 00:48:58,828
Yangpyung is...

609
00:48:59,870 --> 00:49:03,431
Anyway, they must've past
the corner store.

610
00:49:10,047 --> 00:49:12,311
What took you so long, idiot?

611
00:49:12,449 --> 00:49:13,916
What happened?

612
00:49:14,551 --> 00:49:15,813
What about Mi-jin?

613
00:49:15,953 --> 00:49:17,113
I couldn't find her.

614
00:49:17,254 --> 00:49:18,619
What?

615
00:49:18,755 --> 00:49:20,222
See that store
across the street?

616
00:49:20,557 --> 00:49:22,616
- Yes.
- See that alley next to it?

617
00:49:22,759 --> 00:49:24,522
- Yes.
- So,

618
00:49:24,962 --> 00:49:28,125
Search every house from there
to this address with this.

619
00:49:30,968 --> 00:49:32,435
- What is this?
- Find houses

620
00:49:32,569 --> 00:49:36,630
with basements,
where the cell phone wouldn't work.

621
00:49:36,974 --> 00:49:38,635
Where is this house?

622
00:49:40,077 --> 00:49:41,237
Come here.

623
00:49:43,847 --> 00:49:46,008
- See that top over there?
- Yes.

624
00:49:47,050 --> 00:49:48,711
Where the hell
are you looking, idiot?

625
00:49:48,852 --> 00:49:50,717
That top over the cross.

626
00:49:51,054 --> 00:49:52,316
Yes.

627
00:49:52,656 --> 00:49:53,918
Right there.

628
00:49:56,159 --> 00:49:58,127
Why don't we just report it?

629
00:49:58,662 --> 00:49:59,526
They know already.

630
00:49:59,663 --> 00:50:01,631
Then why
go through the trouble?

631
00:50:01,765 --> 00:50:03,528
Just do what I say, asshole.

632
00:50:03,667 --> 00:50:05,328
We have to find Mi-jin.

633
00:50:06,770 --> 00:50:08,032
I got it.

634
00:50:10,574 --> 00:50:11,438
Search every corner!

635
00:50:11,575 --> 00:50:12,633
Okay!

636
00:50:21,551 --> 00:50:23,416
Shit.

637
00:50:33,163 --> 00:50:35,825
If you make an arrest
without a warrant,

638
00:50:35,966 --> 00:50:38,332
you need approval by
a prosecutor within 1 2 hours.

639
00:50:39,269 --> 00:50:40,429
1 2 hours?

640
00:50:40,771 --> 00:50:42,033
Yes.

641
00:50:44,775 --> 00:50:46,242
What if it isn't approved?

642
00:50:47,477 --> 00:50:48,535
We have to release him.

643
00:50:49,579 --> 00:50:50,807
Shit.

644
00:50:50,947 --> 00:50:52,107
Where are you?

645
00:50:52,249 --> 00:50:55,013
It's already two.
What have you been doing?

646
00:50:56,653 --> 00:50:59,918
Why'd you go to Mangwon
after Anyang city?

647
00:51:00,557 --> 00:51:03,924
Then you should've dropped off
the shit thrower.

648
00:51:27,851 --> 00:51:29,216
Sit down.

649
00:51:33,156 --> 00:51:36,319
So did you hit them with a chisel
or hammer them with it?

650
00:51:36,460 --> 00:51:38,223
Used the hammer, of course.

651
00:51:38,762 --> 00:51:39,922
Give me your hand.

652
00:51:41,565 --> 00:51:42,930
Relax.

653
00:51:44,568 --> 00:51:45,432
Why'd you kill them like that?

654
00:51:45,569 --> 00:51:48,436
I choked them and used knives,
but they were too painful.

655
00:51:52,876 --> 00:51:54,935
I saw how pigs were killed
and did the same.

656
00:51:56,179 --> 00:51:57,407
And then?

657
00:51:57,547 --> 00:51:59,310
- Hang them on the wall.
- What?

658
00:51:59,549 --> 00:52:00,516
Yes?

659
00:52:00,650 --> 00:52:01,514
Hang what?

660
00:52:01,651 --> 00:52:03,209
Their bodies, of course.

661
00:52:03,353 --> 00:52:04,513
Say ah.

662
00:52:08,959 --> 00:52:10,221
And then?

663
00:52:11,161 --> 00:52:13,026
You know that muscle
behind the ankles?

664
00:52:13,163 --> 00:52:14,528
- The Achilles tendon?
- Yes.

665
00:52:14,664 --> 00:52:16,529
I slice it with a knife.

666
00:52:16,666 --> 00:52:18,827
- Of the dead body?
- Yes.

667
00:52:18,969 --> 00:52:20,231
Why?

668
00:52:20,370 --> 00:52:23,134
To drain out the blood.
Otherwise they're too heavy to lift.

669
00:52:24,574 --> 00:52:25,632
That's right.

670
00:52:26,376 --> 00:52:28,139
That's how
the corpses get lighter.

671
00:52:28,979 --> 00:52:30,412
So what did you do next?

672
00:52:30,547 --> 00:52:34,916
Leave it around for a day,
drain out all the blood and mess.

673
00:52:35,252 --> 00:52:37,516
Then I ax the bodies
and bury them.

674
00:52:37,654 --> 00:52:38,814
Where?

675
00:52:38,955 --> 00:52:39,922
Yes?

676
00:52:40,357 --> 00:52:42,120
Where'd you bury
the dead bodies?

677
00:52:44,060 --> 00:52:45,721
Here and there.

678
00:52:47,964 --> 00:52:50,125
Here and there is where?
Tell me exactly.

679
00:52:50,267 --> 00:52:51,632
Well...

680
00:52:52,669 --> 00:52:55,536
You wouldn't have buried
nine people in your front yard.

681
00:52:55,672 --> 00:52:57,230
Not nine.

682
00:52:57,674 --> 00:52:58,732
What?

683
00:52:58,875 --> 00:52:59,933
It's twelve.

684
00:53:02,779 --> 00:53:04,906
Why twelve? Wasn't it nine?

685
00:53:06,049 --> 00:53:08,609
Come to think of it,
it was twelve.

686
00:53:08,752 --> 00:53:10,117
Are you kidding me?

687
00:53:10,253 --> 00:53:11,220
Gil-woo!

688
00:53:15,058 --> 00:53:19,324
Just tell us what you remember.

689
00:53:19,462 --> 00:53:21,327
You're doing well.

690
00:53:22,465 --> 00:53:25,229
I was driving
and the Equus popped out.

691
00:53:25,368 --> 00:53:27,632
It slammed into my car,
and this rat was driving.

692
00:53:28,271 --> 00:53:29,533
That's why you beat him?

693
00:53:29,673 --> 00:53:32,836
No, I held on to him
and called 4885.

694
00:53:32,976 --> 00:53:34,443
- And his phone is...
- Hey.

695
00:53:35,178 --> 00:53:37,703
Just answer what I ask you.

696
00:53:38,448 --> 00:53:40,313
So you beat him, right?

697
00:53:41,451 --> 00:53:43,612
It was you
who messed up his face, right?

698
00:53:46,356 --> 00:53:47,414
What are you doing?

699
00:53:51,561 --> 00:53:53,529
Yes? Now?

700
00:53:54,764 --> 00:53:56,026
Yes, sir.

701
00:53:58,768 --> 00:54:00,531
The chief wants to see you.

702
00:54:01,171 --> 00:54:03,833
Testimony
First, press your finger.

703
00:54:17,053 --> 00:54:18,418
Go to Mi-jin's house?

704
00:54:19,356 --> 00:54:21,916
Yes, go with him.

705
00:54:23,660 --> 00:54:25,218
- Why?
- To do a DNA test

706
00:54:25,362 --> 00:54:27,227
on the blood
on his shirt and her samples.

707
00:54:27,364 --> 00:54:30,128
So you actually believe
what this bastard's saying?

708
00:54:30,267 --> 00:54:31,325
Hey! Just go!

709
00:54:31,468 --> 00:54:35,131
I doubt this bastard killed anyone.
Just search the neighborhood.

710
00:54:35,272 --> 00:54:36,432
Hey! Jung-ho!

711
00:54:37,073 --> 00:54:39,439
Give me a break.

712
00:54:41,878 --> 00:54:44,108
Does it taste delicious,
you bastard!

713
00:54:44,247 --> 00:54:45,908
Why do you keep hitting him?

714
00:54:46,049 --> 00:54:47,914
Is this time to eat chocolate?

715
00:54:48,251 --> 00:54:49,616
Hey! Jung-ho!

716
00:54:54,658 --> 00:54:57,320
Bastard.

717
00:55:01,364 --> 00:55:03,127
Is it true that the suspect
threw human feces?

718
00:55:03,266 --> 00:55:05,427
Have you identified
the suspect?

719
00:55:08,471 --> 00:55:09,631
Almost there.

720
00:55:10,573 --> 00:55:13,440
Turn right and go straight?

721
00:55:16,746 --> 00:55:17,906
Straight in?

722
00:55:19,949 --> 00:55:21,007
Steps?

723
00:55:21,851 --> 00:55:23,910
Downstairs?

724
00:55:29,959 --> 00:55:31,119
The first one?

725
00:55:32,962 --> 00:55:34,020
Okay.

726
00:55:35,865 --> 00:55:38,026
Anybody home?
Anybody there?

727
00:55:38,168 --> 00:55:40,136
Of course nobody's here.

728
00:55:42,372 --> 00:55:44,033
What shall we do now?

729
00:55:44,874 --> 00:55:46,034
Let's go to
the owner's house.

730
00:55:46,176 --> 00:55:48,041
Move, move.

731
00:55:54,451 --> 00:55:55,713
What is that?

732
00:55:56,453 --> 00:55:57,715
You scared me.

733
00:55:57,854 --> 00:55:59,617
You should've answered
if you were inside.

734
00:55:59,756 --> 00:56:01,917
- Is this the police?
- Hey, you!

735
00:56:02,058 --> 00:56:03,320
Strangers are breaking in.

736
00:56:03,660 --> 00:56:06,128
Mapo-gu Sangsoo-dong 21-1 5.

737
00:56:06,963 --> 00:56:08,624
They're coming inside!

738
00:56:08,965 --> 00:56:10,023
Give it to me.

739
00:56:11,668 --> 00:56:15,832
Who the hell are you?

740
00:56:17,474 --> 00:56:18,634
I'm asking you.

741
00:56:26,449 --> 00:56:27,711
Are you Mi-jin's daughter?

742
00:56:34,858 --> 00:56:38,225
This place is a mess.

743
00:56:38,361 --> 00:56:40,022
What are you doing here?

744
00:56:40,764 --> 00:56:42,322
Go stay over there.

745
00:56:42,465 --> 00:56:44,126
Why are you
taking someone's hair?

746
00:56:44,768 --> 00:56:46,827
You little prick, go away.

747
00:56:47,470 --> 00:56:49,529
Why are you taking her hair?

748
00:56:49,672 --> 00:56:52,334
Aren't you going to sleep?

749
00:56:52,675 --> 00:56:54,336
You go to sleep.

750
00:56:55,578 --> 00:56:58,513
You're just like your mom.

751
00:56:58,648 --> 00:57:00,013
What about my mom?

752
00:57:00,150 --> 00:57:01,515
You little brat.

753
00:57:02,051 --> 00:57:04,110
All done. So what now?

754
00:57:04,954 --> 00:57:07,422
Leave, of course.

755
00:57:14,264 --> 00:57:15,629
What's your name?

756
00:57:19,169 --> 00:57:20,227
Take it.

757
00:57:21,871 --> 00:57:23,634
Call me
if you get into any trouble.

758
00:57:26,075 --> 00:57:27,133
Let's go.

759
00:57:42,759 --> 00:57:44,317
Damn it.

760
00:57:46,362 --> 00:57:51,231
According to witnesses,

761
00:57:51,367 --> 00:57:54,427
Bastard made me
lose my appetite.

762
00:57:55,572 --> 00:57:57,039
Where's my mom?

763
00:57:58,274 --> 00:57:59,639
She's working.

764
00:57:59,976 --> 00:58:01,739
Then why'd you take her hair?

765
00:58:02,378 --> 00:58:04,209
For a DNA test?

766
00:58:06,950 --> 00:58:08,212
You're unbelievable.

767
00:58:08,351 --> 00:58:10,319
My mom isn't working now,
is she?

768
00:58:12,655 --> 00:58:13,917
Something happened to her?

769
00:58:15,859 --> 00:58:19,920
Don't you have
somewhere to go?

770
00:58:23,466 --> 00:58:24,933
How much did you search?

771
00:58:26,669 --> 00:58:29,934
I'll be there soon,
so search around some more.

772
00:58:30,373 --> 00:58:35,140
Also, do you know anyone
who can look after a kid?

773
00:58:38,147 --> 00:58:39,307
Okay, bye.

774
00:58:48,958 --> 00:58:51,324
Look behind you!

775
00:58:51,661 --> 00:58:53,322
Is there a cigarette?

776
00:58:53,463 --> 00:58:54,327
Yes.

777
00:58:54,464 --> 00:58:56,728
Get back there.

778
00:58:56,866 --> 00:58:59,733
Throw it out the window.

779
00:59:00,870 --> 00:59:02,132
Is it gone?

780
00:59:02,272 --> 00:59:03,534
Yes.

781
00:59:04,474 --> 00:59:06,237
Is there a burned mark?

782
00:59:06,376 --> 00:59:07,934
Yes.

783
00:59:09,078 --> 00:59:11,512
Damn it, nothing's helping me.

784
00:59:11,648 --> 00:59:13,513
What a day.

785
00:59:13,650 --> 00:59:16,118
You called my mom before,
right?

786
00:59:17,053 --> 00:59:20,022
Didn't you ask my mom
to go to work tonight?

787
00:59:20,156 --> 00:59:22,716
I'll send you back home
if you keep bothering me.

788
00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:25,022
Filth.

789
00:59:25,161 --> 00:59:27,322
What did you say?

790
00:59:27,463 --> 00:59:29,124
What? Filth?

791
00:59:33,670 --> 00:59:35,228
Get out!

792
00:59:36,573 --> 00:59:39,133
The Mapo murders
are also included.

793
00:59:39,776 --> 00:59:41,744
But who's this woman
that's alive?

794
00:59:41,878 --> 00:59:45,211
He seems to be lying.
She's probably been murdered.

795
00:59:45,348 --> 00:59:47,407
Except for the Mapo murders,

796
00:59:47,550 --> 00:59:50,018
they were killed at his house
and you can't find the bodies?

797
00:59:50,153 --> 00:59:51,017
No, sir.

798
00:59:51,154 --> 00:59:52,314
If you don't know the address,

799
00:59:52,455 --> 00:59:54,320
it means
you don't know anything.

800
00:59:54,457 --> 00:59:57,119
The suspect can't remember
the address,

801
00:59:57,260 --> 01:00:00,423
but we can find it quickly
if we start searching in the morning.

802
01:00:00,964 --> 01:00:04,127
Why aren't his motives
written down?

803
01:00:04,267 --> 01:00:07,430
He kept on talking gibberish.
No particular motivation.

804
01:00:07,570 --> 01:00:10,733
Then make one up!
What the hell is this?

805
01:00:10,873 --> 01:00:12,431
Yes, sir.

806
01:00:14,477 --> 01:00:15,535
You know
the situation we're in?

807
01:00:15,678 --> 01:00:16,702
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

808
01:00:16,846 --> 01:00:18,609
We die if we blow this.

809
01:00:19,048 --> 01:00:22,017
Get this right
if you want to keep your jobs.

810
01:00:22,151 --> 01:00:24,517
So that the mayor's incident
shuts up, okay?

811
01:00:24,654 --> 01:00:25,621
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

812
01:00:28,958 --> 01:00:29,925
Who is it?

813
01:00:30,059 --> 01:00:32,823
The police. Open the door.

814
01:00:34,764 --> 01:00:38,427
Sit down.

815
01:00:38,768 --> 01:00:39,632
Sit comfortably.

816
01:00:39,769 --> 01:00:41,031
Yes.

817
01:00:42,171 --> 01:00:43,229
Lady.

818
01:00:43,673 --> 01:00:46,437
How can a sister
not know where her brother lives?

819
01:00:46,576 --> 01:00:48,544
We really don't know.

820
01:00:49,078 --> 01:00:51,706
We haven't seen him
for a long time.

821
01:00:51,848 --> 01:00:53,315
How long?

822
01:00:54,050 --> 01:00:56,814
About three years.

823
01:00:56,953 --> 01:00:58,318
Where did he live then?

824
01:00:59,355 --> 01:01:00,822
In prison, right?

825
01:01:01,858 --> 01:01:03,325
Yes, in prison.

826
01:01:03,660 --> 01:01:05,525
What a screwed-up family.

827
01:01:06,262 --> 01:01:08,230
Now let's put things
in order, yes?

828
01:01:08,364 --> 01:01:09,922
Like I said before,

829
01:01:10,066 --> 01:01:15,436
your brother and brother-in-law
sold three of my girls.

830
01:01:15,571 --> 01:01:18,438
But I've paid twenty thousand
for those girls.

831
01:01:18,775 --> 01:01:20,333
What shall we do about that?

832
01:01:29,052 --> 01:01:30,713
Let's sign a contract.

833
01:01:32,055 --> 01:01:33,613
Why aren't you answering?

834
01:01:40,963 --> 01:01:43,625
Byeong-soo!

835
01:01:43,766 --> 01:01:46,030
Are you all right?

836
01:01:46,669 --> 01:01:48,330
Everything's okay.

837
01:01:52,475 --> 01:01:54,943
He was like this
ever since he was a baby.

838
01:01:55,878 --> 01:02:00,008
My son was bleeding
when I came back home.

839
01:02:00,950 --> 01:02:03,510
My damn brother
was the only one home.

840
01:02:03,653 --> 01:02:07,214
Ever since then,
I barely saw my brother.

841
01:02:10,259 --> 01:02:12,022
Where are we going?

842
01:02:13,563 --> 01:02:15,224
I said where are we going?

843
01:02:16,866 --> 01:02:19,027
We're not looking for my mom,
are we?

844
01:02:19,569 --> 01:02:21,628
Be quiet!

845
01:02:22,672 --> 01:02:24,640
Let me think.

846
01:02:33,750 --> 01:02:35,809
Is your name Oh Eun-shil?

847
01:02:35,952 --> 01:02:36,919
Why?

848
01:02:37,453 --> 01:02:40,115
Your eyes are very pretty.

849
01:02:40,256 --> 01:02:42,019
Shut up.

850
01:02:56,172 --> 01:02:57,537
Why'd you cut your hair
so short?

851
01:02:57,673 --> 01:02:59,732
You'd look sexy with long hair.

852
01:03:00,476 --> 01:03:02,535
- Hey!
- Yes?

853
01:03:02,979 --> 01:03:05,106
- You want a beating?
- No.

854
01:03:13,956 --> 01:03:16,925
Just sit and
don't screw around.

855
01:03:25,368 --> 01:03:27,233
You're not wearing
any perfume.

856
01:03:28,070 --> 01:03:31,039
You must be on your period.
Smells fishy.

857
01:03:55,164 --> 01:03:56,631
Is this a call-girl massage parlor?

858
01:03:57,066 --> 01:03:58,124
Let me ask you something.

859
01:04:03,873 --> 01:04:04,931
What's up?

860
01:04:07,376 --> 01:04:09,640
We're in deep trouble.

861
01:04:09,779 --> 01:04:12,714
That asshole has done this
twice before.

862
01:04:12,849 --> 01:04:14,214
What are you talking about?

863
01:04:14,350 --> 01:04:16,318
The prosecutor called.

864
01:04:16,452 --> 01:04:19,216
Young-min said he killed
someone before.

865
01:04:19,355 --> 01:04:21,619
But he was freed since
there wasn't enough evidence.

866
01:04:21,757 --> 01:04:24,817
The prosecutor ordered him
to be freed.

867
01:04:24,961 --> 01:04:27,828
The chief is going to
have a fit.

868
01:04:27,964 --> 01:04:30,023
We're screwed.

869
01:04:32,168 --> 01:04:33,726
You want to die?

870
01:04:35,972 --> 01:04:37,633
Did you kill them or not?

871
01:04:39,575 --> 01:04:40,837
Answer me, you bastard!

872
01:04:40,977 --> 01:04:43,502
Young-min,
you told us everything before.

873
01:04:43,646 --> 01:04:45,307
What's wrong with you?

874
01:04:45,448 --> 01:04:46,915
Turn the camera.

875
01:04:49,852 --> 01:04:51,114
Let me ask you once more.

876
01:04:51,954 --> 01:04:53,421
Did you kill them or not?

877
01:04:55,157 --> 01:04:56,522
I'm sorry.

878
01:04:59,462 --> 01:05:01,225
Who the hell
do you think you are?

879
01:05:01,364 --> 01:05:03,525
You must think
we're some damn clowns.

880
01:05:09,472 --> 01:05:10,336
I checked.

881
01:05:10,473 --> 01:05:13,237
Noryangjin station's warrant
was rejected by the judge.

882
01:05:13,376 --> 01:05:14,934
Eunpyung station was like us.

883
01:05:15,077 --> 01:05:16,442
Both stations
had insufficient evidence.

884
01:05:16,579 --> 01:05:19,707
Screw them.
That asshole is the murderer.

885
01:05:20,349 --> 01:05:22,715
He can't make that kind of statement
if he hadn't killed them.

886
01:05:22,852 --> 01:05:24,217
That's right.

887
01:05:24,553 --> 01:05:26,612
So do you want to let him go?

888
01:05:28,057 --> 01:05:32,016
Or search that neighborhood
to find some evidence?

889
01:05:32,662 --> 01:05:33,720
Listen carefully.

890
01:05:33,863 --> 01:05:35,831
He said he buried
the victims,

891
01:05:35,965 --> 01:05:37,933
- Right?
- Yes, sir.

892
01:05:38,067 --> 01:05:40,433
It means he buried
the victims somewhere else.

893
01:05:40,569 --> 01:05:43,231
He couldn't have buried
all 1 2 bodies in his front yard.

894
01:05:43,773 --> 01:05:45,434
- In the mountain!
- Yes,

895
01:05:45,574 --> 01:05:47,132
but are there
many mountains there?

896
01:05:47,777 --> 01:05:48,641
No, sir.

897
01:05:48,778 --> 01:05:51,713
No, there is only one.
Sungmi Mountain.

898
01:05:51,847 --> 01:05:53,712
- Am I right?
- Yes, sir.

899
01:05:53,849 --> 01:05:55,407
Go search there.

900
01:05:55,551 --> 01:05:58,019
Find the dead bodies.

901
01:06:18,574 --> 01:06:19,836
Are you really a cop?

902
01:06:22,278 --> 01:06:24,109
Show me your badge.

903
01:06:24,547 --> 01:06:26,412
I can't believe this.

904
01:06:27,850 --> 01:06:29,613
You're not a cop, are you?

905
01:06:29,752 --> 01:06:32,812
Fuck.
