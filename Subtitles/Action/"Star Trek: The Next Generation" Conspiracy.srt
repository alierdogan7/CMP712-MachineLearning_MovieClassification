any more than space is immutable.

255

Over the last decade,
he came to believe

that we reside
in one of infinite dimensions,

257
00:17:17,495 --> 00:17:20,544
and what holds us here
is the constancy of time.

of what he expected?

No. But he did say that he was
very close to proving his theories.

But now, in retrospect,
he probably did.

he started a new experiment,

00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:39,835
he insisted that I stay
in what he called "a protected room."

seeming possible,

more and more obsessive.

a good scientist, he kept notes.

control the effects of a time distortion.

Oh, I see, sir. That is quite true, sir.

560
00:34:42,664 --> 00:34:47,044
I see time as a constant, whereas
humans perceive time as flexible.

Hence the expression
"Time flies when you're having fun."
