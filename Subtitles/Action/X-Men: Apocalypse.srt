2
00:01:44,434 --> 00:01:46,561
Death to the false god.

3
00:02:06,266 --> 00:02:08,385
Protect him.

4
00:07:16,542 --> 00:07:19,681
Ten fights, ten victories.

5
00:07:19,863 --> 00:07:21,712
The winged warrior,

6
00:07:22,227 --> 00:07:23,655
The Bird of Prey,

7
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:24,934
The Angel of Death:

8
00:07:25,093 --> 00:07:26,518
Angel!

9
00:07:33,281 --> 00:07:36,361
A round of applause for Porky!

10
00:07:36,982 --> 00:07:39,093
The next contender

11
00:07:39,474 --> 00:07:41,013
comes directly

12
00:07:41,236 --> 00:07:44,036
from the Munich Circus

13
00:07:45,497 --> 00:07:47,013
Ladies and gentlemen

14
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:50,053
the only one who could confront an angel

15
00:07:50,228 --> 00:07:51,760
is the Devil himself

16
00:07:53,328 --> 00:07:55,002
We presnt you

17
00:07:55,796 --> 00:07:57,101
the astounding

18
00:07:57,312 --> 00:07:59,323
the fantastic

19
00:08:00,141 --> 00:08:02,038
Nightcrawler!

20
00:08:22,942 --> 00:08:24,521
High voltage,

21
00:08:24,918 --> 00:08:26,878
the mutant's lament!

22
00:08:43,138 --> 00:08:45,249
Are you lost, little mouse?

23
00:08:45,479 --> 00:08:46,892
The fight's over there.

24
00:08:55,138 --> 00:08:56,741
You're hot.

25
00:08:57,617 --> 00:08:59,251
Ah, you think so?

26
00:10:11,767 --> 00:10:13,426
They're over there!

27
00:10:49,762 --> 00:10:52,611
- Good night, Henryk
- Same to you, Milos

28
00:11:21,969 --> 00:11:23,841
- Hi, darling.
- Hi.

29
00:17:25,082 --> 00:17:26,598
You sell carpets?

30
00:17:26,757 --> 00:17:28,958
You can't come in here.

31
00:17:29,109 --> 00:17:30,839
Is the carpet for sale?

32
00:17:31,085 --> 00:17:32,085
I told you...

33
00:21:33,831 --> 00:21:35,132
Earthquake!

34
00:28:46,845 --> 00:28:48,432
Are you all right?

35
00:28:48,758 --> 00:28:50,059
She's fine.

36
00:28:50,115 --> 00:28:52,567
- Then let her go.
- We'll let her go.

37
00:28:53,361 --> 00:28:55,472
We just want to talk.

38
00:28:58,196 --> 00:29:00,442
You're not wearing badges.

39
00:29:01,030 --> 00:29:02,855
No metal.

40
00:29:03,839 --> 00:29:06,640
Some men say they saw something
in the factory, today

41
00:29:06,775 --> 00:29:09,109
Something that doesn't make sense.

42
00:29:09,259 --> 00:29:10,694
Hold your weapons.

43
00:29:11,077 --> 00:29:13,386
You've been a good citizen, Henryk.

44
00:29:13,553 --> 00:29:15,783
A good neighbor, a good worker...

45
00:29:16,244 --> 00:29:18,870
- I've been told.
- It's true.

46
00:29:19,029 --> 00:29:21,624
But no one in town
knows the truth.

47
00:29:21,703 --> 00:29:23,331
Everybody knows.

48
00:29:24,132 --> 00:29:26,029
I am Henryk Gurzsky

49
00:29:26,268 --> 00:29:28,799
Jakub, I've eaten
with you at your home

50
00:29:28,887 --> 00:29:30,680
And you lied the whole time.

51
00:29:31,109 --> 00:29:33,267
I let a murderer into my home.

52
00:29:35,548 --> 00:29:36,707
Is this you?

53
00:29:41,878 --> 00:29:44,671
Are you the one they call Magneto?

54
00:30:04,943 --> 00:30:06,911
I'll turn myself in.

55
00:30:07,712 --> 00:30:10,997
Please let my daughter go.

56
00:30:20,924 --> 00:30:22,456
Go with your mother.

57
00:30:30,808 --> 00:30:32,340
Please.

58
00:30:33,181 --> 00:30:35,149
Don't leave me.

59
00:30:35,562 --> 00:30:38,077
I won't let them take you away.

60
00:30:45,613 --> 00:30:46,819
What is it?

61
00:30:47,073 --> 00:30:48,470
Is she one of them?

62
00:30:50,426 --> 00:30:53,497
- Tell her to stop.
- She can't control it.

63
00:30:54,339 --> 00:30:55,720
You frighten her.

64
00:30:55,863 --> 00:31:00,442
I won't let them take you!
I won't let them take you!

65
00:31:05,026 --> 00:31:06,335
Make her stop!

66
00:34:07,637 --> 00:34:09,669
Do you know what we do to thieves?

67
00:34:10,121 --> 00:34:11,397
Choose a hand.

68
00:34:11,430 --> 00:34:12,827
Enough.

69
00:34:15,524 --> 00:34:19,587
If you're wth her, I suggest
you leave while you still can.

70
00:34:21,897 --> 00:34:23,175
Go.

71
00:34:24,324 --> 00:34:28,355
Who rules this world?

72
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:30,578
What language is that?

73
00:34:33,030 --> 00:34:35,434
Clown! What's your weapon?

74
00:34:35,513 --> 00:34:36,807
Take it out.

75
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:53,637
Sorry.

76
00:34:59,956 --> 00:35:03,109
Do you feel sorry, really?

77
00:35:15,464 --> 00:35:18,236
Now, you do.

78
00:39:06,645 --> 00:39:09,645
I've never seen another
mutant in this city.

79
00:39:10,087 --> 00:39:12,428
Do you speak Egyptian? Arabic?

80
00:41:23,085 --> 00:41:24,632
Purified.

81
00:54:16,879 --> 00:54:18,561
Henryk, please.

82
00:54:18,807 --> 00:54:20,140
Don't do this.

83
01:25:53,749 --> 01:25:57,804
All your towers and temples

84
01:25:58,312 --> 01:25:59,749
shall fall.

85
01:26:00,188 --> 01:26:05,425
The dawn of a new era will arise.
