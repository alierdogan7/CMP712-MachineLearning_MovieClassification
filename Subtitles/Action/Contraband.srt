01:42:47,621 --> 01:42:50,248
Come on, it's been
all over the news.

1484
01:42:51,458 --> 01:42:53,710
No. No idea.

1485
01:42:55,170 --> 01:42:56,672
What's that thing
worth, anyway?

1486
01:42:56,755 --> 01:42:58,840
About 140 million.

1487
01:42:59,883 --> 01:43:02,427
What's that,

Wow. Whoo!

1494
01:43:35,544 --> 01:43:36,670
Twenty.

1495
01:43:37,754 --> 01:43:39,715
Twenty! It's twenty!
