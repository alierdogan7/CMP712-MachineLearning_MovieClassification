00:29:19,357 --> 00:29:22,656
My best?
I was curled up in a ball while he got shot.

343
00:29:23,328 --> 00:29:24,795
We should have dumped those guys.

344
00:29:24,896 --> 00:29:29,424
How can they just wave a pen
and change what happens just like that?

345
00:29:29,534 --> 00:29:32,526
We're the police.
We can do whatever the hell we want.

346
00:29:33,338 --> 00:29:36,364
Doesn't matter what happens.
It's how we write it up.

347
00:29:36,474 --> 00:29:37,964
What about the truth?

348
00:29:38,977 --> 00:29:40,274
What about it?

349
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:45,147
You have to honor him, your friend.

350
00:29:45,250 --> 00:29:46,877
"Honor him"?

351
00:29:46,985 --> 00:29:49,954
I was going to knock him out
and he thought I was going to kill him.

352
00:29:50,088 --> 00:29:51,077
Prick.

353
00:29:51,189 --> 00:29:52,986
Don't turn your back on him.

354
00:29:54,793 --> 00:29:56,488
Good can come from bad.

355
00:29:56,795 --> 00:29:59,593
In my world, the real world,

356
00:30:02,233 --> 00:30:04,793
the bad breeds more bad, Grace.

357
00:30:12,744 --> 00:30:17,579
See this? It's done. It's over.
It's taken care of. All right?

358
00:30:22,754 --> 00:30:25,086
I won't give you another dose here,

359
00:30:25,657 --> 00:30:27,750
but got a set of blues in your locker?

360
00:30:28,593 --> 00:30:29,855
- No.
- Here's the thing.

361
00:30:29,961 --> 00:30:31,428
- I gotta bury you.
- Not that.

362
00:30:31,529 --> 00:30:36,523
In a nice, politically correct spot until this
Washington thing settles down a little bit.

363
00:30:36,634 --> 00:30:37,692
No, Jack.

preliminary interviews of the complainant.

preliminary interviews of the complainant.

against an officer,

367
00:30:47,645 --> 00:30:50,170

368
00:30:50,782 --> 00:30:54,377
Now, the temptation is to be
a good brother cop.

369
00:30:55,420 --> 00:30:58,685
Don't be. None of this shit's
going anywhere anyway.

371

- Okay.
- Okay.

375

You have a complaint?

376
00:31:25,016 --> 00:31:28,452
Motherfucker beat my ass like I was
Rodney King, man.

377
00:31:28,553 --> 00:31:30,316
Except there wasn't no video.

378
00:31:30,421 --> 00:31:32,116
Dude looked just like you.

379
00:31:32,657 --> 00:31:33,646
But black.

380
00:31:33,758 --> 00:31:38,593
This ass been working longer than all
y'all cops disrespecting me.

381
00:31:38,696 --> 00:31:41,893
He pulled me out of my ride, homes,
disrespected me in front of my old lady.

382
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,298
Tried to get her number and shit.

383
00:31:44,402 --> 00:31:46,370
You get his badge number
or see his nametag?

384
00:31:46,471 --> 00:31:49,201
Not with his boot on my throat
and his partner kicking me.

385
00:31:49,307 --> 00:31:50,296
No, it was a little bit difficult.

386
00:31:50,408 --> 00:31:52,171
Everybody comes here,
they have a complaint.

387
00:31:52,277 --> 00:31:54,211
They sit down.
I done waited for my fucking five hours

388
00:31:54,312 --> 00:31:55,904
and you gonna ask me,
do I have a complaint?

389
00:31:56,014 --> 00:31:57,914
Obviously, I have a complaint.

390
00:31:58,249 --> 00:31:59,773
You know what? This is some bullshit.

391
00:31:59,884 --> 00:32:01,317
That's why I hate
all these motherfucking cops.

392

Wander has got a sense of humor,
I'll give him that.

394
00:32:15,633 --> 00:32:17,123
You have a complaint?

395
00:32:17,802 --> 00:32:19,235
Where to begin?

396
00:32:21,873 --> 00:32:23,272
The black band.

397
00:32:23,975 --> 00:32:26,239
Man down. Hurts, right?

398
00:32:26,577 --> 00:32:29,045
Losing a colleague. Brother in blue.

399
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:31,275
I'm sorry he's gone, sir.

400
00:32:32,350 --> 00:32:36,912
You two worked Vice Special together.
Pushed a black and white in Southend.

401

Phonebook Tom,

402
00:32:39,390 --> 00:32:41,517
the last of the ghetto gunfighters.

403
00:32:42,527 --> 00:32:45,291
I heard you got your best confession
with a '91 directory.

404
00:32:45,396 --> 00:32:48,160
You know Washington was holding
the asshole down.

405
00:32:49,434 --> 00:32:50,958
Is this an interview?

406
00:32:51,069 --> 00:32:52,502
Just a little back and forth.

407
00:32:52,603 --> 00:32:57,404
Well, Captain, I'm not much of a dancer,
so if there's something you'd like to ask...

408
00:32:57,842 --> 00:32:59,810
Want to go and get some lunch, Tom?

409
00:33:01,879 --> 00:33:03,506
This is the interview.

410
00:33:04,115 --> 00:33:07,642
Regarding yesterday's incident,
you were the first on scene, correct?

411
00:33:09,554 --> 00:33:11,078
Yes, sir.

412
00:33:11,189 --> 00:33:14,283
- Three shooters, right?
- Two. Read the report.

413
00:33:14,392 --> 00:33:16,986
What would you say if I told you
the pathologist recovered

414
00:33:17,095 --> 00:33:20,030
three different calibers
from Terrence Washington's body?

415
00:33:21,032 --> 00:33:23,091
Sounds like three shooters to me.

416
00:33:24,068 --> 00:33:26,036
What were you doing there, Tom?

417
00:33:31,142 --> 00:33:33,110
Come on, man to man. Tape's off.

418
00:33:36,214 --> 00:33:37,647
Damn it!

419
00:33:37,749 --> 00:33:40,547
It doesn't bother you that
there are two cop killers out there?

420
00:33:40,651 --> 00:33:42,983
Living, laughing, fucking?
It doesn't bother you, Tom?

421
00:33:43,087 --> 00:33:44,520
Yes, it bothers me!

422
00:33:45,723 --> 00:33:47,850
So, why'd you let them
get away, gunfighter?

423
00:33:47,959 --> 00:33:51,360
Hey, let's get something straight, Captain,
nobody's getting away.

424
00:33:51,462 --> 00:33:53,828
What happened to the video
from the store?

425
00:33:54,932 --> 00:33:56,331
What video?

426
00:33:57,135 --> 00:34:00,229
Listen to me. Every time you shit the bed,

427
00:34:00,338 --> 00:34:03,671
Wander's there to change the sheets.
Well, not anymore, son.

428
00:34:03,775 --> 00:34:05,709
I'm going to pour gas on you,

429
00:34:05,810 --> 00:34:08,973
I'm going to pour gas on Wander
and everyone in Vice Special.

430
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:12,277
Then I'm lighting the match
and I'm gonna burn all of you.

431
00:34:13,051 --> 00:34:15,576
I tried to save you, Detective Ludlow.

Your window's closed.

433
00:34:18,122 --> 00:34:22,491
And that third shooter?
He's mine, so help me God.

434
00:34:26,831 --> 00:34:28,628

435
00:34:31,302 --> 00:34:33,964
<i>- WOMAN: Captain, you there?</i>
- I'll call you back.

436
00:34:35,706 --> 00:34:37,765
What the fuck are you doing in my office?

437
00:34:37,875 --> 00:34:40,503
What the fuck are you doing
jamming my people at lunch?

438
00:34:40,611 --> 00:34:43,375
If you got a problem with Ludlow,
you come to me.

00:34:49,554 --> 00:34:50,919
Stop right there.

443
00:34:51,622 --> 00:34:52,919
Stop.

444
00:34:54,459 --> 00:34:57,257
Tom is a damn fine cop.

445
00:34:57,829 --> 00:34:59,729
He bleeds blue.

446
00:35:01,399 --> 00:35:03,367
You got an open case on him?

447
00:35:03,935 --> 00:35:05,232

448
00:35:06,070 --> 00:35:07,594
You got one on me?

449

You formally investigating us?

450
00:35:13,945 --> 00:35:15,810
This is a fishing expedition.

451
00:35:16,114 --> 00:35:18,912
Because you know if you went to the Chief
and you asked him

452
00:35:19,016 --> 00:35:21,280
to open a case on me
or anybody in my unit,

453
00:35:21,385 --> 00:35:22,875
he would laugh you out of his office.

460
00:35:43,207 --> 00:35:45,767
I saw the way you watched him
when he came in.

461
00:35:45,877 --> 00:35:49,335
That's why you follow him around,
you want him to give you a blow job.

462

when we were sergeants.

your prick out of the ghetto.

00:39:33,838 --> 00:39:34,964
- Harry!
- Hey.

516
00:39:35,506 --> 00:39:37,303
I thought you were dead.

517
00:39:58,662 --> 00:40:00,459
I'm from Vice Special.

518
00:40:02,666 --> 00:40:04,964
CORONER: Tom Ludlow.
I know who you are.

519
00:40:05,336 --> 00:40:07,395
I handled your wife's autopsy.

520
00:40:09,106 --> 00:40:11,199
- That was you?
- Mmm-hmm.

521
00:40:11,308 --> 00:40:12,866
The asshole. Remember?

522
00:40:13,577 --> 00:40:14,874
Right.

523
00:40:15,446 --> 00:40:18,540
The guy who washed away all the hair
and fiber evidence.

524
00:40:18,783 --> 00:40:21,115
The guy who wouldn't do a vaginal swab.

525
00:40:21,519 --> 00:40:23,749
The guy who left me nothing to go on.

526
00:40:24,422 --> 00:40:26,754
It's not my job to investigate adultery.

527
00:40:26,857 --> 00:40:28,292
How can I help you?

528
00:40:28,292 --> 00:40:28,587
How can I help you?

529
00:40:33,330 --> 00:40:36,197
- Pulled these out of Washington?
- Yup.

530
00:40:36,901 --> 00:40:38,129
Eighteen rounds.

531
00:40:38,235 --> 00:40:40,294
Ten.45-caliber full metal jackets.

532
00:40:40,404 --> 00:40:42,031
Seven 9-mil FMJs.

533
00:40:42,139 --> 00:40:45,540
And a single.38 hollow-point
mushroomed against his scapula.

534
00:40:45,810 --> 00:40:46,902
Serious overkill.

535
00:40:47,011 --> 00:40:49,502
He must have really pissed off
the shooters.

536
00:40:52,249 --> 00:40:54,046
DISKANT: Get what you're looking for?

537
00:40:56,353 --> 00:40:58,878
Hi, I'm Detective Diskant.
We spoke on the phone earlier.

538
00:40:58,989 --> 00:41:00,889
- I'm here for the ballistics evidence.
- How you doing?

539
00:41:00,991 --> 00:41:02,288
DISKANT: Thank you.

540
00:41:02,526 --> 00:41:04,084
When can I expect your report?

541
00:41:04,195 --> 00:41:07,164
CORONER: Give me about an hour or so.
The lab's backlogged today.

542
00:41:07,264 --> 00:41:10,392
- Thanks. Can you fax it to my office?
- Sure can.

543
00:41:10,501 --> 00:41:11,968
Thank you, Doc.

544
00:41:19,977 --> 00:41:21,808
Diskant, talk to me.

545
00:41:22,580 --> 00:41:25,947
You got three different calibers,
that means three weapons.

546
00:41:26,183 --> 00:41:28,981
What's your take on what went down
in that market?

547
00:41:30,020 --> 00:41:32,215
Two bad guys come in the front door
to rob the place.

548
00:41:32,323 --> 00:41:34,314
One of them sees the clerk,
cuts him in half.

549
00:41:34,425 --> 00:41:35,585
The other one sees Washington,

550
00:41:35,693 --> 00:41:38,821
whose weapon is already drawn,
empties his clip into him.

551
00:41:39,063 --> 00:41:41,531
His buddy joins the party till he runs dry.

552
00:41:41,932 --> 00:41:43,058
And one of them pulls a two-incher,

553
00:41:43,167 --> 00:41:46,159
pumps a final "fuck you" round
into Washington's back.

554
00:41:46,537 --> 00:41:48,801
They leave, you show up

555
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:51,267
after they're gone.

556
00:41:52,409 --> 00:41:54,343
You got it all figured out.

557
00:41:58,315 --> 00:42:01,978
I got your back here, but you got to keep
your distance and let me work this case.

558
00:42:02,086 --> 00:42:04,646
No one's gonna find these assholes.
Is that what you need to hear from me?

559
00:42:04,755 --> 00:42:06,484
Are you fucking kidding me?

560
00:42:07,558 --> 00:42:09,287
They get a pass, you get a pass.
That's the deal, right?

561
00:42:09,393 --> 00:42:12,021
What are you talking about,
the shooters get a pass?

562
00:42:12,129 --> 00:42:14,029
I don't understand,
Clady said you were on board.

563
00:42:14,131 --> 00:42:15,655
Not with this.

564
00:42:15,766 --> 00:42:18,394
What's the deal, are you throwing
this case for a promotion?

565
00:42:18,502 --> 00:42:20,163
If I were you,
I'd be more worried about yourself.

566
00:42:20,271 --> 00:42:23,434
Hey, you piece of shit!
You got a 187 on a peace officer

567
00:42:23,541 --> 00:42:25,372
and you're fucking letting
the suspects walk!

568
00:42:25,476 --> 00:42:27,205
- You want these guys found?
- That doesn't piss you off?

569
00:42:27,311 --> 00:42:29,108
- So they can put you at the store?
- Doesn't it piss you off?

570
00:42:29,213 --> 00:42:30,578
Place you at the store
before the shooting?

571
00:42:30,681 --> 00:42:32,273
You want to catch a felony
for obstruction?

572
00:42:32,383 --> 00:42:34,977
If I say you weren't there,
you weren't there.

573
00:42:36,287 --> 00:42:38,755
This is your mess and I'm cleaning it up.

574
00:42:38,856 --> 00:42:40,323
Yeah, it pisses me off!

575
00:42:40,424 --> 00:42:41,391
(CELL PHONE RINGING)

576
00:42:42,793 --> 00:42:43,760
Diskant.

577
00:42:45,162 --> 00:42:46,288
Yeah.

578
00:42:46,864 --> 00:42:49,162
Yes. Hang on one second.

579
00:42:53,871 --> 00:42:55,338
All right, go ahead.

580
00:42:56,874 --> 00:42:59,468
All right, thank you. Bye-bye.

581
00:43:02,980 --> 00:43:04,072
Fremont and Coates.

582
00:43:04,181 --> 00:43:07,981
The lab found saliva on a cigarette butt
and the bandana outside the store.

583
00:43:08,085 --> 00:43:09,677
DNA corresponds to those two names.

584
00:43:09,787 --> 00:43:12,017
Congratulations, you IDed the shooters.

585
00:43:12,122 --> 00:43:14,147
Yeah. Normally, I'd be pretty happy.

586
00:43:14,258 --> 00:43:17,193
Pull their rap sheets. Give me copies.

587
00:43:17,294 --> 00:43:18,522
I'll see you around.

588
00:43:25,336 --> 00:43:27,600
Computer says you arrested these guys.

589
00:43:29,006 --> 00:43:32,134
Fremont and Coates.

590
00:43:32,242 --> 00:43:34,608
Good guys. Say hi for me.

591
00:43:34,712 --> 00:43:36,077
You remember them?

592
00:43:36,180 --> 00:43:39,581
Who can forget?
Heroin dealers with a taste for blood.

593
00:43:40,718 --> 00:43:44,381
Came up from Belize to make a sale
and they liked the Southland so much,

594
00:43:44,488 --> 00:43:45,477
they never left.

595
00:43:45,589 --> 00:43:49,992
Yeah. We hooked these two fine
gentlemen on a rape-mutilation caper.

596
00:43:50,094 --> 00:43:53,689
Seems they had a three-day hostage-fest
with this cute little Guatemalan chick

597
00:43:53,797 --> 00:43:56,664
that they snatched up when
she was walking home from dental school.

598
00:43:56,767 --> 00:43:57,734
They hurt her bad.

599
00:43:57,835 --> 00:44:00,565
- Then why are they on the street?
- SANTOS: They walked from the beef.

600
00:44:00,671 --> 00:44:04,801
One of our own felt we violated
Mr. Coates' and Mr. Fremont's civil rights

601
00:44:04,908 --> 00:44:06,671
and told the City Attorney.

602
00:44:06,777 --> 00:44:09,507
- Washington dimed you out?
- Yep.

603
00:44:10,547 --> 00:44:12,811
Why do you think they put the dude
in Community Relations?

604
00:44:12,916 --> 00:44:14,645
Are you shitting me?

605
00:44:14,752 --> 00:44:17,346
Washington kicked loose the very guys
who whacked him?

606
00:44:17,454 --> 00:44:19,854
Damn ironic, isn't it?

607
00:44:19,957 --> 00:44:23,017
Oh, guys! What is this, a garage sale?

608
00:44:24,161 --> 00:44:26,789
How you doing, Lud? What's this? Why...

609
00:44:28,198 --> 00:44:29,961
Lud, why do you have this?

610
00:44:30,067 --> 00:44:32,433
Those are the shitbags
who popped Washington.

611
00:44:32,536 --> 00:44:33,867
Sarge, we can get these guys.

612
00:44:33,971 --> 00:44:36,872
No, no.
Not if you want to keep your badge.

613
00:44:36,974 --> 00:44:39,909
Besides, these two animals?
These guys, they'll take care of each other.

614
00:44:40,010 --> 00:44:41,204
They'll be dead by the end of the week.

615
00:44:41,311 --> 00:44:43,779
Probably shoot each other's fucking faces
off, knowing these two.

616
00:44:43,881 --> 00:44:44,870
You know how that shit works.

617
00:44:44,982 --> 00:44:48,509
This week's suspects,
next week's victims, right?

618
00:44:50,554 --> 00:44:51,919
Yeah, right.

619
00:44:58,295 --> 00:44:59,262
(BANGING ON DOOR)

620
00:45:06,570 --> 00:45:08,367
What the hell are you doing here, Tom?

621
00:45:08,472 --> 00:45:09,769
Let's talk.

622
00:45:24,455 --> 00:45:26,389
I'm sick of this shit, man.

623
00:45:26,490 --> 00:45:28,856
It's the same damn song for three years.

624
00:45:28,959 --> 00:45:30,551
Crying about your wife.

625
00:45:31,462 --> 00:45:32,793
She's gone, Tom.

626
00:45:34,164 --> 00:45:36,928
What's it gonna take to
bring you back from Mars?

627
00:45:39,737 --> 00:45:41,261
Have I ever asked you for anything?

628
00:45:41,371 --> 00:45:42,895
You know what?
You ask me for shit all the time.

629
00:45:43,006 --> 00:45:45,702
Big things, Jack. Important things.

630
00:45:47,177 --> 00:45:48,439
What's up, Tom?

631
00:45:48,946 --> 00:45:52,507
Give me a green light to take out
the assholes who did Washington.

632
00:45:53,317 --> 00:45:56,286
Come on, Jack. King's X.

633
00:45:57,654 --> 00:45:59,212
What the hell is this?

634
00:45:59,456 --> 00:46:02,755
I can lay them out like I did those Koreans,
but off the books.

635
00:46:02,860 --> 00:46:06,660
I'm talking shovels and trash bags.
Who's gonna know? Who's gonna care?

636
00:46:06,764 --> 00:46:08,163
The Koreans?

637
00:46:08,766 --> 00:46:10,563
That... That was business.

638
00:46:10,934 --> 00:46:15,303
This? This is some crazy bullshit rattling
around in that drunk-ass mind of yours.

639
00:46:15,672 --> 00:46:19,472
Look at yourself!
Look at yourself, Tom! You're a mess!

640
00:46:21,078 --> 00:46:23,069
When did you start drinking today?

641
00:46:23,180 --> 00:46:25,774
Your little airplane bottles of vodka?

642
00:46:26,450 --> 00:46:28,816
And you drove over here intoxicated.
You want a second DUI?

643
00:46:28,919 --> 00:46:31,820
No one's going to fuck with me, Jack!
You're not listening to me!

644
00:46:31,922 --> 00:46:33,355
You're not listening to me!

645
00:46:33,457 --> 00:46:36,119
No, you listen to me!

646
00:46:36,226 --> 00:46:38,990
This is much bigger than that.

647
00:46:40,597 --> 00:46:42,462
Do you think Biggs is stupid?

648
00:46:42,566 --> 00:46:45,558
He's got a PhD in catching cops slipping.

649
00:46:46,703 --> 00:46:49,331
You know this. You know all this.

650
00:46:50,874 --> 00:46:52,569
You got to hold your mud.

651
00:46:52,943 --> 00:46:54,376
Can you do that?

652
00:46:55,913 --> 00:46:59,314
It's time to turn the page
and close the book.

653
00:47:09,793 --> 00:47:11,055
They took $200?

654
00:47:11,895 --> 00:47:14,455
I... I forgot about it till I saw this.

655
00:47:16,033 --> 00:47:17,295
That's the man.

656
00:47:18,268 --> 00:47:19,360
That's him.

657
00:47:20,871 --> 00:47:24,398
He took all my pay.
Said it was for the cookie jar.

658
00:47:26,410 --> 00:47:27,843
The cookie jar?

659
00:47:28,078 --> 00:47:29,136
That's what he said.

660
00:47:29,246 --> 00:47:30,213
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

661
00:47:33,884 --> 00:47:35,351
I'll be right back.

662
00:47:50,667 --> 00:47:52,430
What do you want, Disco?

663
00:47:54,071 --> 00:47:57,438
Washington was dirty.
He was a piece of shit.

664
00:48:01,044 --> 00:48:02,841
Why are you telling me this?

665
00:48:03,046 --> 00:48:04,536
I think you know why.

666
00:48:05,983 --> 00:48:07,450
I know why.

667
00:48:10,320 --> 00:48:13,255
- Are you recording this, huh?
- That's a new phone.

668
00:48:13,357 --> 00:48:15,689
You working for Internal Affairs?

669
00:48:15,792 --> 00:48:17,384
You made one deal.

670
00:48:17,494 --> 00:48:19,086
Maybe you made two.

671
00:48:19,196 --> 00:48:22,256
Captain Biggs flip you
to the dark side, punk?

672
00:48:23,333 --> 00:48:24,800
You know what?

673
00:48:26,837 --> 00:48:28,498
They're right about you.

674
00:48:28,672 --> 00:48:30,367
You are fucking out there.

675
00:48:31,141 --> 00:48:33,541
From now on, you stay away from me.
We don't talk.

676
00:48:33,644 --> 00:48:36,272
All right, hold on, Disco. Hold on. Hold on.

677
00:48:38,081 --> 00:48:40,743
I gotta watch my own back these days,
you know?

678
00:48:41,485 --> 00:48:43,112
Come on. Don't be mad.

679
00:48:43,387 --> 00:48:45,014
Washington was dirty.

680
00:48:47,457 --> 00:48:49,254
Hit me, princess.

681
00:48:49,660 --> 00:48:50,922
Go on.

682
00:48:51,895 --> 00:48:53,692
A couple things.

683
00:48:54,464 --> 00:48:57,024
You know we found $50,000 in cash
on him at the store.

684
00:48:57,134 --> 00:49:00,365
No, I didn't. That's a lot of cash,
but not in itself damning.

685
00:49:00,470 --> 00:49:01,937
Oh, but this is.

686
00:49:02,539 --> 00:49:03,597

I found it in Washington's truck.

688
00:49:05,242 --> 00:49:08,302
I had SID scan it.
Corresponds to a kilo of heroin.

689

Guess who comes along
and signs out the dope?

690

Washington?

691
00:49:13,250 --> 00:49:16,310
Washington signed out heroin
and returned brown sugar.

692
00:49:18,889 --> 00:49:21,084
The guys who whacked him moved dope.

693
00:49:22,326 --> 00:49:25,853
You know, Washington sprung them from
a rape beef on a technicality.

694
00:49:25,963 --> 00:49:29,421
No, I did not know that.
Maybe they had a business arrangement.

695
00:49:30,701 --> 00:49:32,134
Maybe it was a hit.

696
00:49:32,436 --> 00:49:34,768
That would explain the heavy artillery.

698
00:49:39,409 --> 00:49:41,673
He was dirty, so fuck him.
