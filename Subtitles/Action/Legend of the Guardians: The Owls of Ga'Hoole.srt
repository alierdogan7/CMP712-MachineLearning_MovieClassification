1
00:01:29,675 --> 00:01:31,267
OWL 1:
Okay, I'm ready.

2
00:01:32,845 --> 00:01:35,006
OWL 2:
My talons are upon you!

3
00:01:35,181 --> 00:01:38,173
Your days of terrorizing
the owl kingdoms are over!

4
00:01:38,350 --> 00:01:42,081
Not so fast! You're no match
for my army of Evil Ones.

5
00:01:42,254 --> 00:01:43,846
Ha, ha! Well, perhaps.

6
00:01:44,023 --> 00:01:46,184
- But I am Lyze of Kiel.
Soren, but...

7
00:01:46,358 --> 00:01:49,850
And I have assembled my own army,
the Guardians of Ga'Hoole!

8
00:01:50,029 --> 00:01:51,121
But, Soren...

9
00:01:51,297 --> 00:01:55,199
we've sworn an oath to make strong the
weak, mend the broken, and vanquish evil!

10
00:01:55,367 --> 00:01:56,891
Oh.

11
00:01:57,069 --> 00:01:58,798
Eglantine, what is it?

12
00:01:58,971 --> 00:02:03,032
Soren, this time you said
I would be Lyze of Kiel.

13
00:02:03,209 --> 00:02:05,143
Oh, come on. Look, next go, all right?

14
00:02:05,311 --> 00:02:08,906
Well, I hope you're not lying...

15
00:02:09,081 --> 00:02:11,481
...to Metal Beak! Rawr!

16
00:02:12,251 --> 00:02:13,411
Got you! Ow!

17
00:02:13,886 --> 00:02:16,480
Oh. My beak. Da.

18
00:02:16,689 --> 00:02:19,817
Okay. Enough, young owlets.
Time for bed.

19
00:02:19,992 --> 00:02:22,825
Yes, please.
Enough stories about the Guardians.

20
00:02:22,995 --> 00:02:26,328
Now, Kludd, stories are part
of our culture and our history.

21
00:02:26,499 --> 00:02:27,727
We learn from them.

22
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:30,164
Even after the 700th time
we hear them?

23
00:02:30,336 --> 00:02:34,636
Yes, even then. Unless, son,
you already know all there is of our history.

24
00:02:34,807 --> 00:02:36,274
I know the Guardians win.

25
00:02:36,442 --> 00:02:38,740
- Soren, it's just a story.
- It is not!

26
00:02:38,911 --> 00:02:40,071
Here we go again.

27
00:02:40,246 --> 00:02:42,976
I mean, Da, have you ever seen
a Guardian?

28
00:02:43,149 --> 00:02:46,585
Kludd, just because you can't
see something doesn't mean it isn't real.

29
00:02:46,852 --> 00:02:49,650
It's like feeling something
with your gizzard.

30
00:02:49,822 --> 00:02:51,483
You know, through our gizzards...

31
00:02:51,657 --> 00:02:54,490
...the voices of the ages whisper to us
and tell us what's right.

32
00:02:55,861 --> 00:02:57,692
Now, that's enough for one night, dear.

33
00:02:57,863 --> 00:03:00,297
Tomorrow's a big day.
It's first branching.

34
00:03:00,466 --> 00:03:03,299
- Now, off to bed.
- Now, come along, children.

35
00:03:03,469 --> 00:03:07,303
I've made the moss and down
extra soft for you, Eglantine.

36
00:03:07,473 --> 00:03:10,931
Soren, do you really think
Metal Beak is real?

37
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:15,672
You remember,
it was the Battle of the Ice Claws.

38
00:03:15,848 --> 00:03:19,716
The Guardians were outnumbered.
Things looked dark.

39
00:03:20,452 --> 00:03:22,511
But then Lyze of Kiel...

40
00:03:22,688 --> 00:03:25,282
...struck down the leader
of the evil owls.

41
00:03:27,359 --> 00:03:29,054
The Guardians were victorious.

42
00:03:29,261 --> 00:03:32,196
The owl kingdoms were free once more.

43
00:03:32,364 --> 00:03:37,097
<i>And then they returned home,
to the Great Tree of Ga'Hoole.</i>

44
00:03:37,269 --> 00:03:38,293
Wow.

45
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:41,735
But some say the evil king still lives...

46
00:03:41,907 --> 00:03:46,571
...and wears a metal mask
to hide his missing beak.

47
00:03:47,746 --> 00:03:49,509
Stop! You're gonna give her daymares.

48
00:03:49,682 --> 00:03:51,479
But this is my favorite part.

49
00:03:51,650 --> 00:03:54,141
I know. We've heard it a thousand times.

50
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:55,753
You have a soft head, Soren.

51
00:03:55,921 --> 00:03:59,357
I think Da has filled it
with stories and dreams.

52
00:03:59,525 --> 00:04:01,516
There's nothing wrong with dreams.

53
00:04:01,694 --> 00:04:04,891
That's the difference between us.
I have mine when I'm asleep.

54
00:04:05,064 --> 00:04:06,554
Now would you just go to sleep?

55
00:04:07,733 --> 00:04:09,394
Soren...

56
00:04:11,070 --> 00:04:14,403
...Da says our dreams are who we are.

57
00:04:29,722 --> 00:04:32,384
- So as I was... Kludd, wait!
- No!

58
00:04:32,558 --> 00:04:34,082
Look, Da!

59
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:35,693
I'm gonna be the best flier.

60
00:04:35,861 --> 00:04:38,659
That's because Tytos are best
at everything.

61
00:04:38,831 --> 00:04:40,196
Right, Da?

62
00:04:40,366 --> 00:04:45,394
You have strength, Kludd. But owls make
the best hunters for one reason alone.

63
00:04:45,571 --> 00:04:49,029
Yeah, I know. Their silent flight.
By the time I have my claws out...

64
00:04:49,208 --> 00:04:52,575
The mice will have run away. And you
and your hatchlings will go hungry.

65
00:04:52,745 --> 00:04:53,939
Da!

66
00:04:54,113 --> 00:04:55,137
I'm ready.

67
00:04:55,347 --> 00:04:56,678
Heh-heh-heh. Young Guardian...

68
00:04:56,849 --> 00:04:59,613
...I don't think your first branching lesson
will be that dangerous.

69
00:05:00,152 --> 00:05:02,985
Now, don't worry how much noise
you make in the beginning.

70
00:05:03,155 --> 00:05:05,419
You just need to stretch your...

71
00:05:05,658 --> 00:05:06,920
...wings.

72
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:09,120
Well done.

73
00:05:09,295 --> 00:05:10,592
Beginner's luck.

74
00:05:16,602 --> 00:05:19,230
Whoa! Whoa.
Whoa.

75
00:05:20,105 --> 00:05:23,404
You know, Kludd, it helps when
I picture where I'm gonna land.

76
00:05:23,575 --> 00:05:25,099
Come on, I'll race you!

77
00:05:25,277 --> 00:05:26,437
Okay. Go!

78
00:05:28,514 --> 00:05:30,880
- Ha, ha! Ha!
- Yeah, you had a head start.

79
00:05:31,050 --> 00:05:33,177
- No, I didn't!
- Yeah, you did. Da, he cheated.

80
00:05:33,385 --> 00:05:34,977
Boys. No more fighting.

81
00:05:35,154 --> 00:05:38,817
- Let's get the boys inside. It's time to go.
- Can we come with you on the hunt?

82
00:05:38,991 --> 00:05:42,825
Not tonight. But when the time comes,
at least you'll have the helmet for it.

83
00:05:43,963 --> 00:05:45,658
- Nice helmet.
- Get off!

84
00:05:45,831 --> 00:05:46,855
Boys.

85
00:05:47,032 --> 00:05:48,795
Do it again. Say it again.

86
00:05:50,836 --> 00:05:55,000
Noctus, I know Soren's a bit of a dreamer.
Do you worry for him?

87
00:05:55,174 --> 00:05:57,005
Oh, I worry for both of them.

88
00:05:57,343 --> 00:05:59,368
Seems like yesterday
they were hatchlings...

89
00:05:59,545 --> 00:06:03,572
...and now, well, you know, they'll
soon be grown and leaving the hollow.

90
00:06:04,416 --> 00:06:06,475
I just want them to be prepared.

91
00:06:06,652 --> 00:06:09,519
Mmm. They'll be fine.

92
00:06:09,788 --> 00:06:11,949
Mm.
- Come on.

93
00:06:29,875 --> 00:06:31,467
Eglantine, are you all right?

94
00:06:31,643 --> 00:06:33,133
Oh, it's all right, dear.

95
00:06:33,445 --> 00:06:36,039
If it wants to come out, let it.

96
00:06:37,182 --> 00:06:39,810
That's it, dear. That's it. Keep going.

97
00:06:39,985 --> 00:06:42,010
Oh, it's going to be beautiful!

98
00:06:43,455 --> 00:06:45,946
There you go.
Eg, that is gross!

99
00:06:46,125 --> 00:06:47,183
Quite an achievement.

100
00:06:47,359 --> 00:06:49,418
- What is it?
- It's your first pellet.

101
00:06:49,595 --> 00:06:52,393
First? You mean there'll be more?

102
00:06:52,564 --> 00:06:54,589
Don't you recognize it, Eg?

103
00:06:54,767 --> 00:06:56,496
It was the mouse you ate.

104
00:06:56,668 --> 00:06:58,226
Its fur and bones, anyway.

105
00:06:59,004 --> 00:07:01,336
Every owl yarps up pellets.

106
00:07:01,507 --> 00:07:05,170
In fact, I think I might have
your brothers' first pellets.

107
00:07:05,344 --> 00:07:07,335
- No, no.
- Maybe you'd like to see them?

108
00:07:07,513 --> 00:07:10,209
- No. Oh, Mrs. P, not again. Please.
- Oh, come on, dear.

109
00:07:10,382 --> 00:07:13,112
Such a big night for this tree.
First branching, first pellet.

110
00:07:14,486 --> 00:07:16,215
Excuse me.

111
00:07:16,388 --> 00:07:19,118
Kludd, do you want to go out
and try some more branching?

112
00:07:19,291 --> 00:07:21,953
What? So you can go out there
and show off again?

113
00:07:22,127 --> 00:07:23,253
I don't think so.

114
00:07:23,429 --> 00:07:25,056
Oh, maybe you're right.

115
00:07:25,230 --> 00:07:26,788
Maybe we should just...

116
00:07:26,965 --> 00:07:30,560
...I don't know, stay inside
and play Battle of the Ice Claws again.

117
00:07:36,809 --> 00:07:40,905
Kludd? Could I just show you how?
Without you being so angry?

118
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:43,207
All right. Show me how.

119
00:07:43,382 --> 00:07:45,077
Well, before I leap...

120
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:50,449
...I picture myself standing on a great cliff
with the Guardians, ready for battle.

121
00:07:50,622 --> 00:07:53,785
We leap down,
floating silently like Lyze of Kiel.

122
00:07:54,093 --> 00:07:56,618
- The air's just carrying us as we...
- That's enough!

123
00:08:11,477 --> 00:08:13,570
Kludd, are you okay?

124
00:08:13,745 --> 00:08:14,973
Oh, no.

125
00:08:16,181 --> 00:08:17,580
We're on the ground.

126
00:08:17,749 --> 00:08:19,239
We can't be here. It's... It's...

127
00:08:20,052 --> 00:08:22,782
This is the worst place for an owl.

128
00:08:23,455 --> 00:08:25,685
Yeah. No, no. It's weird down here.

129
00:08:25,858 --> 00:08:28,053
No. We gotta get back. We can't be here.

130
00:08:28,627 --> 00:08:32,393
You know, if we could just make it
to that branch.

131
00:08:32,564 --> 00:08:34,122
Then we could climb our way up.

132
00:08:35,067 --> 00:08:37,695
Yeah, here, let's see.

133
00:08:43,175 --> 00:08:45,075
Shh! Quiet!

134
00:08:50,849 --> 00:08:51,873
What was that?

135
00:09:02,427 --> 00:09:03,451
Soren!

136
00:09:03,629 --> 00:09:04,653
Kludd!

137
00:09:13,505 --> 00:09:16,474
Kludd! Kludd!

138
00:09:37,563 --> 00:09:39,155
Where are you taking us?

139
00:09:39,431 --> 00:09:40,728
But our home's that way.

140
00:09:43,635 --> 00:09:44,761
You can't do this!

141
00:09:44,937 --> 00:09:48,532
Keep your mouth shut,
or I'll shut it for you.

142
00:09:48,707 --> 00:09:51,369
- What'd you think, Jutt?
- The "I'll shut it for you" part?

143
00:09:51,543 --> 00:09:54,774
No, not that. My evil stare.
Been working on it for weeks.

144
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:56,607
Oh. I missed it. Let's see.

145
00:09:58,483 --> 00:09:59,507
Lmpressive.

146
00:09:59,685 --> 00:10:00,709
- You like it?
Yeah.

147
00:10:00,886 --> 00:10:04,982
You know, your evil stare reminds me
a little of my "Intimidator."

148
00:10:05,157 --> 00:10:06,954
Yeah?
I raise one eyebrow...

149
00:10:07,125 --> 00:10:08,183
...tuck in my chin and...

150
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:10,590
- who are you?
- Hey! No questions.

151
00:10:10,762 --> 00:10:12,923
No "whos," no "whats," no "whys."

152
00:10:13,098 --> 00:10:15,157
You'll see soon enough.

153
00:10:15,734 --> 00:10:18,601
What do you think?
Did that evil stare seem forced or natural?

154
00:10:18,770 --> 00:10:20,738
- Completely natural.
- Oh, thanks.

155
00:10:20,906 --> 00:10:22,305
- Let me go!
Ow!

156
00:10:24,243 --> 00:10:25,267
Kludd!

157
00:10:32,818 --> 00:10:35,912
- Strong beak, that one.
- Yeah? Well, they'll put that to good use.

158
00:10:38,557 --> 00:10:41,219
You know, Jatt, if I use your evil stare...

159
00:10:41,393 --> 00:10:43,759
...and combine it with
my raised-eyebrow look...

160
00:10:43,929 --> 00:10:44,953
...I get this.

161
00:10:45,130 --> 00:10:47,121
- What do you call that?
- "The Predator."

162
00:10:47,299 --> 00:10:50,496
"The Predator"?
It's a bit silly, don't you think?

163
00:11:14,426 --> 00:11:16,519
Hey, Jatt, look. It's Grimble.

164
00:11:16,728 --> 00:11:18,457
Perfect. Hit him with the new look.

165
00:11:18,630 --> 00:11:20,154
With or without raised eyebrow?

166
00:11:20,332 --> 00:11:22,926
With raised eyebrow.
With raised eyebrow.

167
00:11:23,368 --> 00:11:25,700
Greetings, Grimble.

168
00:11:25,871 --> 00:11:29,932
Jutt, Jatt, so nice to see you both.

169
00:11:30,108 --> 00:11:32,338
Did you only get half an owl tonight,
Grimble?

170
00:11:32,511 --> 00:11:34,308
No, Jatt. It's an elf owl.

171
00:11:34,479 --> 00:11:37,346
They're very small, but hard workers.

172
00:11:37,516 --> 00:11:39,882
Too old to carry a full-size one?

173
00:11:40,252 --> 00:11:42,220
Yeah, hilarious.

174
00:11:42,387 --> 00:11:44,947
Is there something wrong
with your face, Jutt?

175
00:11:45,657 --> 00:11:47,648
Huh? No!

176
00:11:47,826 --> 00:11:49,794
You've upset him now.
It's a new look!

177
00:11:49,961 --> 00:11:51,690
But you gotta work on your comebacks.

178
00:11:51,863 --> 00:11:52,887
I'm Soren.

179
00:11:53,865 --> 00:11:55,127
I'm Gylfie.

180
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:56,961
He said you were an elf owl.

181
00:11:57,135 --> 00:11:59,660
From Kuneer. That's in the desert.

182
00:11:59,838 --> 00:12:01,203
Are you a Tyto?

183
00:12:01,373 --> 00:12:02,567
Yeah, from Tyto Forest.

184
00:12:02,774 --> 00:12:04,173
Who are these owls?

185
00:12:04,776 --> 00:12:06,869
Do you have any idea
where they're taking us?

186
00:12:07,045 --> 00:12:09,536
Hey! Stop talking.

187
00:12:54,559 --> 00:12:56,049
Quiet! Listen to the old man!

188
00:12:56,228 --> 00:12:57,252
Kludd!

189
00:12:57,429 --> 00:12:58,623
Settle down.
Silence!

190
00:12:58,797 --> 00:12:59,889
- Kludd!
Silence!

191
00:13:00,198 --> 00:13:02,428
Your parents and families
have abandoned you.

192
00:13:03,101 --> 00:13:06,434
So from now,
you'll be classified as orphans.

193
00:13:06,605 --> 00:13:07,867
No, I'm not an orphan.

194
00:13:08,039 --> 00:13:09,904
Horribly tragic, I know.

195
00:13:10,075 --> 00:13:12,066
But by the mercy of Glaux...

196
00:13:12,244 --> 00:13:16,408
...you've been rescued
and brought here to St. Aegolius.

197
00:13:16,581 --> 00:13:20,449
And, in time, you'll come to be grateful
for the kindness shown to you.

198
00:13:20,619 --> 00:13:22,644
You'll repay that kindness with labor.

199
00:13:23,054 --> 00:13:24,646
Some of you will be pickers.

200
00:13:24,856 --> 00:13:26,380
No, I don't want to be a picker!

201
00:13:26,558 --> 00:13:28,992
Some will be soldiers.
- Gylfie, stay with me.

202
00:13:29,161 --> 00:13:33,621
In your ways, all will serve
the High Tyto and the Pure Ones.

203
00:13:33,799 --> 00:13:35,460
- Let us go!
- Silence.

204
00:13:35,834 --> 00:13:37,563
We don't want to serve the Pure Ones.

205
00:13:37,736 --> 00:13:39,033
OWL: Who are the Pure Ones?
- Silence!

206
00:13:58,190 --> 00:14:02,251
I am Nyra,
Ablah General of St. Aegolius...

207
00:14:02,427 --> 00:14:05,328
...and mate to the Lord High Tyto.

208
00:14:05,831 --> 00:14:08,629
I know right now
you miss your families...

209
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:14,136
...but soon enough you will understand
the Pure Ones are your new family.

210
00:14:14,306 --> 00:14:17,207
The Pure Ones are not our family.
Let us go!

211
00:14:17,676 --> 00:14:19,667
She's right. Let us go!

212
00:14:23,849 --> 00:14:24,873
What's this?

213
00:14:27,686 --> 00:14:30,814
Tyto, don't waste your time.
Don't soil your feathers.

214
00:14:30,989 --> 00:14:32,217
You leave her be.

215
00:14:32,424 --> 00:14:36,326
Oh, spirited little Tyto. How touching.

216
00:14:36,495 --> 00:14:39,862
You and your patch of felt
will stay together, then.

217
00:14:40,031 --> 00:14:41,191
As pickers.

218
00:14:42,734 --> 00:14:44,565
Let's go. Hurry up.

219
00:14:44,736 --> 00:14:49,730
Perhaps when you remember your nobility,
Tyto, we can make a soldier of you.

220
00:14:49,908 --> 00:14:51,375
Come on.
- What about my brother?

221
00:14:51,576 --> 00:14:54,238
- Oh? Where's he?
- Kludd!

222
00:14:56,948 --> 00:15:00,247
Owlet, that one says you're his brother.

223
00:15:01,453 --> 00:15:02,977
Would you like to join him?

224
00:15:08,026 --> 00:15:09,357
I didn't think so.

225
00:15:09,728 --> 00:15:10,752
Kludd?

226
00:15:10,929 --> 00:15:12,692
Here we go. Move along. Move it along.

227
00:15:12,864 --> 00:15:15,196
- Kludd!
- Now, there's a soldier.

228
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:30,411
Thank you.

229
00:15:32,083 --> 00:15:36,713
Soren, you know, you don't have to be here
with me. You should be with your brother.

230
00:15:37,122 --> 00:15:39,784
No, Gylfie. I could never be
with those Tytos.

231
00:15:39,958 --> 00:15:41,823
I don't know why Kludd
would even think...

232
00:15:41,993 --> 00:15:44,018
Hey! What's wrong with him?

233
00:15:44,195 --> 00:15:45,787
He looks like he's been moon...

234
00:15:45,997 --> 00:15:48,522
All right, you owlets, move it in,
move it in. Come on!

235
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:52,363
Do exactly as he says or you'll never
see the light of dawn.

236
00:15:52,537 --> 00:15:54,437
- Nice one, Jutt.
- Felt a little forced.

237
00:15:54,606 --> 00:15:57,074
- It was awesome.
- Thank you, Jatt.

238
00:16:06,451 --> 00:16:08,919
So tonight, we want you to...

239
00:16:09,087 --> 00:16:10,987
- what was it again, Jatt?
- To rest.

240
00:16:11,156 --> 00:16:12,214
To rest.

241
00:16:12,390 --> 00:16:14,153
So lean back, put your beaks up...

242
00:16:14,326 --> 00:16:18,228
...and turn your faces to the light
of the glorious full moon.

243
00:16:18,530 --> 00:16:20,794
And sleep.

244
00:16:21,833 --> 00:16:25,269
Soren, we mustn't fall asleep.

245
00:16:25,737 --> 00:16:27,796
I think they're trying to moon blink us.

246
00:16:27,973 --> 00:16:29,133
Moon blink us?

247
00:16:29,307 --> 00:16:32,970
Sometimes in the desert, owls would
get exhausted and collapse under it.

248
00:16:33,945 --> 00:16:36,971
When they woke up,
they just weren't the same.

249
00:16:38,316 --> 00:16:41,080
As if they'd forgotten who they were.

250
00:16:42,487 --> 00:16:46,548
Gylfie, we are going to get out of here.

251
00:16:49,461 --> 00:16:51,190
I know these stars.

252
00:16:51,363 --> 00:16:53,160
I could get us away from here...

253
00:16:53,798 --> 00:16:56,289
...but the only way out is to fly
and we can't.

254
00:16:56,468 --> 00:16:57,526
Not yet, we can't.

255
00:16:58,169 --> 00:17:00,433
But we're gonna learn how.

256
00:17:00,605 --> 00:17:02,129
Whenever they're not watching...

257
00:17:02,307 --> 00:17:05,299
...every chance we get,
we're gonna stretch out our wings...

258
00:17:15,987 --> 00:17:18,512
Do you really think
that we can make it, Soren?

259
00:17:19,190 --> 00:17:21,658
Together, Gylfie, we'll get away.

260
00:17:22,794 --> 00:17:24,159
I'm cold.

261
00:17:25,463 --> 00:17:26,725
Together.

262
00:17:42,514 --> 00:17:46,644
All right, my lovely little owlets.
That's enough beauty rest.

263
00:17:46,818 --> 00:17:49,582
Wakey, wakey. Rise and shine.
It's another glorious day...

264
00:17:49,754 --> 00:17:51,244
Oh, no.
Soren.

265
00:17:51,423 --> 00:17:53,516
That's right. Here we go.
Move it along.

266
00:17:53,692 --> 00:17:54,750
Soren.

267
00:17:55,126 --> 00:17:56,650
Where are we going now?

268
00:17:56,828 --> 00:17:59,524
Gylfie, we need to act moon blinked.

269
00:17:59,698 --> 00:18:01,666
Keep moving.
Lots of pellet picking ahead.

270
00:18:01,833 --> 00:18:04,165
You may have noticed
that we don't like dawdling.

271
00:18:04,335 --> 00:18:07,498
Anything with w's in it,
we don't trust.

272
00:18:09,374 --> 00:18:11,740
Come on.
Shuffle those talons.

273
00:18:12,777 --> 00:18:15,211
The sooner you get there,
the sooner we start.

274
00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:18,349
The sooner you start,
the sooner we finish. Let's go!

275
00:18:19,551 --> 00:18:21,018
Keep moving, no dawdling.

276
00:18:21,186 --> 00:18:23,677
And welcome to the Pelletorium.

277
00:18:23,855 --> 00:18:26,187
It's a great place
for the rest of your lives.

278
00:18:26,357 --> 00:18:29,349
You mustn't feel sorry for them
down there.

279
00:18:29,527 --> 00:18:34,863
As lower species, they are fortunate
to serve a higher cause.

280
00:18:35,033 --> 00:18:38,696
As Tyto owls,
their natural superiors...

281
00:18:38,870 --> 00:18:41,634
...you too are part of that plan.

282
00:18:41,806 --> 00:18:45,867
One that will soon bring order
to all the owl kingdoms...

283
00:18:46,044 --> 00:18:48,137
...when the Pure Ones will rule.

284
00:18:48,713 --> 00:18:52,171
A new and noble era will dawn.

285
00:18:52,584 --> 00:18:54,484
Now, prove your greatness...

286
00:18:55,587 --> 00:18:57,384
...and rise.

287
00:18:59,224 --> 00:19:00,248
Higher!

288
00:19:06,264 --> 00:19:07,595
Higher!

289
00:19:10,001 --> 00:19:12,128
Let's get this party started!

290
00:19:12,303 --> 00:19:14,168
Let's get picking!

291
00:19:14,339 --> 00:19:16,569
Start picking up those pellets right now.

292
00:19:16,741 --> 00:19:18,902
That's right. Think of the joy. Pellets.

293
00:19:19,077 --> 00:19:20,408
We love them.

294
00:19:20,578 --> 00:19:22,170
Ugh. Other owls' pellets.

295
00:19:22,347 --> 00:19:25,612
You know, maybe it would have been
better if we had been moon blinked.

296
00:19:25,784 --> 00:19:27,411
Oh, here we go.
Eureka.

297
00:19:27,584 --> 00:19:31,486
Great job, number 857... whatever.

298
00:19:31,655 --> 00:19:33,748
All right, everyone, gather around.

299
00:19:33,924 --> 00:19:35,949
- Hey, you with the blank expression.
That's all of them.

300
00:19:36,126 --> 00:19:39,118
Oh. Pay attention. He's talking.

301
00:19:39,296 --> 00:19:41,958
Now this is the kind of pellet
you're picking for.

302
00:19:42,132 --> 00:19:44,862
Mouse fur, mouse bones,
that's all standard.

303
00:19:45,035 --> 00:19:49,802
But the secret rare ingredient in this one
is what Mr. Mouse ate:

304
00:19:49,973 --> 00:19:52,441
- A metal fleck.
- Metal fleck.

305
00:19:52,609 --> 00:19:54,099
Now, I'm very perceptive.

306
00:19:54,278 --> 00:19:55,336
- He is.
- I am.

307
00:19:55,512 --> 00:19:58,379
- And I'm detecting you...
Nicely done.

308
00:19:58,549 --> 00:20:03,111
...want to volunteer to take this fleck
to where all the flecks belong.

309
00:20:03,287 --> 00:20:05,448
You all watching? Hm?

310
00:20:05,622 --> 00:20:06,850
Come on.

311
00:20:25,142 --> 00:20:26,166
Soren.

312
00:20:54,471 --> 00:20:57,201
Ha, ha. All right, more baskets to fill.

313
00:20:57,774 --> 00:20:59,173
Back to work.

314
00:21:00,844 --> 00:21:02,243
What happened?

315
00:21:02,446 --> 00:21:06,405
Listen, Gylfie, those birds are
doing something terribly wrong.

316
00:21:06,583 --> 00:21:09,017
We have to find Kludd
and we have to get out of here.

317
00:21:09,186 --> 00:21:12,349
And exactly what do you two think
you're doing?

318
00:21:13,056 --> 00:21:14,648
Eh?

319
00:21:20,297 --> 00:21:23,755
OWL:
Once we have amassed enough flecks...

320
00:21:23,934 --> 00:21:25,765
...we will set a trap.

321
00:21:26,036 --> 00:21:31,372
Then it is up to you to lure our enemy
to their rightful place:

322
00:21:31,775 --> 00:21:34,369
Into our claws.

323
00:21:34,544 --> 00:21:40,710
And then the western Kingdoms
and the Tree, those will be mine.

324
00:21:41,518 --> 00:21:44,078
You have my word.

325
00:22:03,573 --> 00:22:05,336
What do you plan on doing with us?

326
00:22:05,542 --> 00:22:06,907
Quiet!

327
00:22:20,090 --> 00:22:21,990
What is this place?
Get inside.

328
00:22:22,259 --> 00:22:24,693
Stop asking questions.

329
00:22:29,299 --> 00:22:33,429
The Pure Ones won't be too happy
if you don't let us get to the Pelletorium.

330
00:22:33,603 --> 00:22:34,627
No.

331
00:22:34,805 --> 00:22:38,935
And they won't be too happy when they
find out what I'm gonna do to you either.

332
00:22:40,677 --> 00:22:42,975
I'm gonna teach you to fly.

333
00:22:43,847 --> 00:22:45,041
Fly?

334
00:22:45,215 --> 00:22:46,307
You can breathe now.

335
00:22:51,221 --> 00:22:53,280
Yeah, it's been getting worse here.

336
00:22:53,890 --> 00:22:59,021
I told myself if any came who were smart,
and brave enough to resist...

337
00:22:59,196 --> 00:23:00,629
...I'd help them.

338
00:23:00,797 --> 00:23:03,129
I guess you two'll have to do.

339
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:04,631
But aren't you a?

340
00:23:04,801 --> 00:23:07,736
A Pure One? No, I hate them.

341
00:23:08,105 --> 00:23:11,666
Almost as much as I hate
what they've turned me into.

342
00:23:12,609 --> 00:23:16,511
My feathers weren't always stained
with these colors.

343
00:23:17,714 --> 00:23:22,344
<i>When the Pure Ones invaded our kingdom,
I fought back.</i>

344
00:23:22,753 --> 00:23:25,654
<i>Now, they thought they could use that...</i>

345
00:23:25,822 --> 00:23:27,050
<i>...so they took my family.</i>

346
00:23:28,425 --> 00:23:32,384
<i>And they promised me if I followed orders,
no harm would come to them.</i>

347
00:23:34,498 --> 00:23:37,524
<i>And I've been doing their dirty work
ever since.</i>

348
00:23:45,642 --> 00:23:49,043
Now, have you flown at all before?

349
00:23:49,212 --> 00:23:50,736
Well, I have been branching.

350
00:23:50,914 --> 00:23:53,781
You don't have the luxury of
gliding down from a nest anymore.

351
00:23:53,950 --> 00:23:58,250
We need to work on your power skills,
starting with what you already know.

352
00:23:58,422 --> 00:23:59,912
Show me what you can do.

353
00:24:01,258 --> 00:24:02,452
Come on.

354
00:24:11,701 --> 00:24:12,725
Hey, good, good.

355
00:24:13,904 --> 00:24:17,704
Now, try and feel every muscle,
every feather in each stroke.

356
00:24:20,043 --> 00:24:21,237
And push!

357
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:24,504
Ow!

358
00:24:27,451 --> 00:24:30,682
Heh-heh-heh. All right, you two,
that's enough. Come on.

359
00:24:30,921 --> 00:24:32,218
Back to practice.

360
00:24:33,924 --> 00:24:36,119
Now, the best of you...

361
00:24:36,293 --> 00:24:38,659
...the fittest and the most brilliant...

362
00:24:38,829 --> 00:24:41,764
...I will present to the Lord High Tyto.

363
00:24:42,466 --> 00:24:45,401
So let's see how much
you've improved...

364
00:24:45,702 --> 00:24:48,796
...as fliers, as fighters.

365
00:24:51,842 --> 00:24:52,934
Well?

366
00:25:45,962 --> 00:25:50,695
Well done. You've shown exceptional
obedience and discipline.

367
00:25:50,867 --> 00:25:55,031
My husband will be most pleased
by your progress.

368
00:25:55,839 --> 00:26:00,538
Hm. Tell me, does your brother have
similar potential as a flier?

369
00:26:00,710 --> 00:26:01,768
Who, Soren?

370
00:26:02,078 --> 00:26:07,141
No. He fell out of the tree when
he was still a hatchling. He's lame.

371
00:26:07,350 --> 00:26:12,788
Oh, soldier, you mustn't
confuse praise for license.

372
00:26:13,023 --> 00:26:15,048
Never lie to me.

373
00:26:15,425 --> 00:26:20,089
For the Lord High Tyto, we need
as many strong fliers as we can find.

374
00:26:20,297 --> 00:26:24,028
Come, let's tell your brother
what rewards there are...

375
00:26:24,201 --> 00:26:27,830
...for those who recognize
their true family.

376
00:26:28,705 --> 00:26:30,730
No, more flap, deeper flap.

377
00:26:31,007 --> 00:26:33,339
The still air has no shape to use.

378
00:26:33,510 --> 00:26:36,240
You gotta compensate
with your downstroke.

379
00:26:36,413 --> 00:26:40,782
Make your wing tips almost meet,
if you can, without stalling.

380
00:26:40,951 --> 00:26:45,047
I can't curl my feathers enough, Grimble.
My wings are too short.

381
00:26:45,222 --> 00:26:48,248
Well, they said Lyze of Kiel's
wings were short.

382
00:26:48,425 --> 00:26:49,858
And that didn't stop him.

383
00:26:50,594 --> 00:26:54,291
And you're gonna need to fly
a long way to get to the Guardians.

384
00:26:54,464 --> 00:26:57,194
- The Guardians of Ga'Hoole?
- Yeah.

385
00:26:57,367 --> 00:26:59,096
But how will we know where to go?

386
00:26:59,269 --> 00:27:02,102
Well, you have to get to
the Sea of Hoolemere...

387
00:27:02,272 --> 00:27:05,105
...yeah, where the Tree
is shrouded in ancient mists...

388
00:27:05,275 --> 00:27:09,871
"which keep it hidden from all but the
strong of purpose and the true of heart."

389
00:27:10,046 --> 00:27:11,946
Yeah, exactly.

390
00:27:12,749 --> 00:27:14,114
I'd come with you...

391
00:27:14,284 --> 00:27:18,482
...but I still hold out the hope
of freeing my family.

392
00:27:18,655 --> 00:27:20,122
Really?

393
00:27:21,791 --> 00:27:23,315
- Kludd.
- Go!

394
00:27:23,493 --> 00:27:24,653
Kludd, come with us!

395
00:27:25,495 --> 00:27:26,553
Go, now!

396
00:27:26,730 --> 00:27:27,754
Get them!

397
00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:40,075
- Kludd!
- Your little owlets won't get away.

398
00:27:50,387 --> 00:27:51,877
Soren! What do we do?

399
00:28:00,430 --> 00:28:01,954
Soren, we have to go!

400
00:28:02,132 --> 00:28:04,464
Wait. Kludd! Come on!
Now's our chance!

401
00:28:04,634 --> 00:28:08,434
Well, what are you waiting for, son?
This is your chance to go home!

402
00:28:11,941 --> 00:28:13,169
I am.

403
00:28:13,343 --> 00:28:14,833
I am home.

404
00:28:16,713 --> 00:28:18,305
- Eh?
- No.

405
00:28:22,686 --> 00:28:24,415
Would you wound your queen, Grimble?

406
00:28:24,721 --> 00:28:26,484
You're not my queen!

407
00:28:29,926 --> 00:28:31,416
We need to jump now, Soren!

408
00:28:34,664 --> 00:28:36,427
- Now! Aah!
Aah!

409
00:28:40,236 --> 00:28:42,295
Come on, Gylfie! Flap!

410
00:28:42,472 --> 00:28:43,700
Flap your wings!

411
00:28:59,456 --> 00:29:01,947
No! Follow the owlets!

412
00:29:02,659 --> 00:29:04,718
Follow the owlets!

413
00:29:05,328 --> 00:29:06,488
Go, you fools!

414
00:29:06,663 --> 00:29:09,689
Go! Go tell the Guardians!

415
00:29:42,098 --> 00:29:44,225
Look! There! I see a way!

416
00:29:44,401 --> 00:29:46,460
Where? Aah!

417
00:29:46,636 --> 00:29:49,605
Gylfie, come on, follow me!

418
00:30:14,798 --> 00:30:16,959
Faster, Gylfie. Come on! Faster!

419
00:30:17,133 --> 00:30:21,160
I can't, Soren, I just can't. I have to rest.

420
00:30:21,471 --> 00:30:24,269
No, Gylfie. Come on, we have to!

421
00:30:27,911 --> 00:30:31,438
Hey, wait. I think they're gone.

422
00:30:31,614 --> 00:30:33,912
What? Are you sure?

423
00:30:38,621 --> 00:30:39,952
I think so.

424
00:30:47,197 --> 00:30:49,165
Hey, you know what?

425
00:30:49,332 --> 00:30:50,594
What?

426
00:30:50,834 --> 00:30:52,563
We're flying.

427
00:31:04,781 --> 00:31:07,181
Does it feel the way
you thought it would?

428
00:31:07,784 --> 00:31:08,876
No.

429
00:31:10,086 --> 00:31:12,179
It feels much better.

430
00:31:18,428 --> 00:31:20,658
What are we gonna do now, Soren?

431
00:31:20,830 --> 00:31:23,458
We're gonna find
the Guardians of Ga'Hoole.

432
00:31:27,637 --> 00:31:30,902
Grimble's death was unfortunate.

433
00:31:31,207 --> 00:31:32,538
But you...

434
00:31:32,709 --> 00:31:36,645
You had a chance to follow your brother,
yet you didn't.

435
00:31:36,813 --> 00:31:40,305
I'm starting to think that you might
actually deserve to stay.

436
00:31:40,483 --> 00:31:42,007
To be one of us.

437
00:31:42,185 --> 00:31:43,743
Oh, I want that.

438
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:45,649
We offer power and purpose.

439
00:31:46,356 --> 00:31:47,846
What can you offer us?

440
00:31:48,725 --> 00:31:50,659
What can you offer me?

441
00:31:51,361 --> 00:31:52,726
I...

442
00:31:53,997 --> 00:31:56,557
- I have a sister.
- Go on.

443
00:31:57,033 --> 00:31:59,831
She's young, but she's got spirit...

444
00:32:00,203 --> 00:32:03,195
...and will grow into a strong Tyto.

445
00:32:03,373 --> 00:32:05,136
Perhaps you could bring her to me.

446
00:32:05,642 --> 00:32:09,408
Here the young ones are our future.

447
00:32:12,515 --> 00:32:13,709
Are you hungry?

448
00:32:13,883 --> 00:32:15,009
Why?

449
00:32:15,184 --> 00:32:16,515
Watch this.

450
00:32:17,587 --> 00:32:21,353
Hey! Oh, nice hunting.
You should be really proud of yourself...

451
00:32:21,524 --> 00:32:23,424
...catching a moth that's already caught.

452
00:32:23,593 --> 00:32:25,151
Wait. You hadn't caught it.

453
00:32:25,562 --> 00:32:29,692
Mm! I was very close.
One might even say I was this close:

454
00:32:30,433 --> 00:32:31,923
Ah.

455
00:32:32,101 --> 00:32:33,693
- Perfect.
Ahem.

456
00:32:35,104 --> 00:32:38,301
An ambush.
Well, I bet you didn't count on this.

457
00:32:46,082 --> 00:32:49,051
I'm sorry.
We didn't mean to take your moth.

458
00:32:49,218 --> 00:32:51,243
- It wasn't his moth.
Yes, it was.

459
00:32:52,188 --> 00:32:54,884
We were just looking for a place
to hide and rest.

460
00:32:55,058 --> 00:32:56,650
- In which order?
What do you mean?

461
00:32:56,826 --> 00:32:58,953
Did you need to hide first
or rest first?

462
00:32:59,128 --> 00:33:00,561
What difference does it make?

463
00:33:01,097 --> 00:33:04,464
Huge! If you need to hide first,
I'd say you were in big trouble.

464
00:33:04,634 --> 00:33:08,161
But if resting was on your mind,
I'd say your situation wasn't as dire.

465
00:33:08,338 --> 00:33:10,397
We're on our way to
the Sea of Hoolemere.

466
00:33:10,573 --> 00:33:12,598
We're gonna find
the Guardians of Ga'Hoole.

467
00:33:12,775 --> 00:33:13,969
Really?

468
00:33:14,944 --> 00:33:18,175
Two little owlets like you
will never reach the sea.

469
00:33:18,348 --> 00:33:21,442
There are some really scary beasts
out that way.

470
00:33:21,618 --> 00:33:23,108
Scary beasts?

471
00:33:23,286 --> 00:33:26,915
If the hawks don't make a quick lunch
of you, then the buzzards will.

472
00:33:27,090 --> 00:33:29,615
And if the buzzards don't get you...

473
00:33:29,792 --> 00:33:34,957
...the dingoes wait in the trees
and as you fly by they...

474
00:33:35,131 --> 00:33:38,430
Our request remains the same, owl.

475
00:33:38,868 --> 00:33:41,769
Do you have a place to rest?
My friend's hurt.

476
00:33:45,975 --> 00:33:47,374
Name's Digger.

477
00:33:50,313 --> 00:33:51,871
The hollow's this way.

478
00:33:54,484 --> 00:33:55,883
Going to the sea, huh?

479
00:33:56,052 --> 00:33:57,144
Yeah.

480
00:33:57,787 --> 00:34:00,381
You know what they call owls
who fly towards the sea?

481
00:34:00,623 --> 00:34:02,488
- Uh, no.
- Lost.

482
00:34:04,060 --> 00:34:06,551
It's hilarious. I have another one for you.

483
00:34:06,729 --> 00:34:08,128
What do you call an owl?

484
00:34:08,564 --> 00:34:10,725
Twilight! We've got company!

485
00:34:10,900 --> 00:34:13,061
Put me down this instant! I mean it!

486
00:34:13,269 --> 00:34:15,066
This is highly disrespectful!

487
00:34:16,205 --> 00:34:17,729
Dinner is served.

488
00:34:17,907 --> 00:34:20,501
And she will not stop talking.

489
00:34:20,677 --> 00:34:21,905
Mrs. P! It's me, Soren!

490
00:34:22,078 --> 00:34:23,170
Soren!

491
00:34:23,680 --> 00:34:25,511
Oh, it can't be.

492
00:34:25,682 --> 00:34:30,210
Every day, I've been looking for
you and Kludd, and then this.

493
00:34:30,386 --> 00:34:33,150
To be snatched up by this monstrosity.

494
00:34:33,322 --> 00:34:35,984
Monstro? The audacity!

495
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:39,560
Digger, who are these tiny owls
and why are they talking to dinner?

496
00:34:39,729 --> 00:34:41,424
My name is not "dinner."

497
00:34:42,799 --> 00:34:45,199
Well, dinner's rather moody, isn't it?

498
00:34:45,368 --> 00:34:48,030
Wait. She is not dinner.
She's my nursemaid.

499
00:34:48,204 --> 00:34:52,163
I just hate being driven to hiss.
So unladylike.

500
00:34:52,341 --> 00:34:53,399
Indeed.

501
00:34:53,576 --> 00:34:57,171
Mrs. P, these are my new friends.
This is Gylfie and Digger.

502
00:34:57,346 --> 00:34:58,938
And Twilight, is it?

503
00:34:59,115 --> 00:35:01,049
Charmed to meet you, dinner.

504
00:35:01,217 --> 00:35:02,878
Oh, I mean, Mrs. P.

505
00:35:03,052 --> 00:35:05,282
These two are going
to the Sea of Hoolemere...

506
00:35:05,455 --> 00:35:06,922
...to find the Guardians.

507
00:35:07,090 --> 00:35:08,421
- Really?
What?

508
00:35:08,591 --> 00:35:13,290
No, Soren, we need to get you home.
Your parents are so worried.

509
00:35:13,463 --> 00:35:16,694
No, you don't understand, Mrs. P.
Kludd and I were kidnapped.

510
00:35:16,866 --> 00:35:19,460
- Mercy!
- He's still held captive.

511
00:35:19,635 --> 00:35:22,866
I have to find the Guardians.
They're the only ones that can save him.

512
00:35:23,039 --> 00:35:24,438
An adventure afoot!

513
00:35:24,607 --> 00:35:26,404
Danger. Intrigue.

514
00:35:26,576 --> 00:35:28,567
The stuff of songs.

515
00:35:28,745 --> 00:35:30,474
Oh, no. Not the lute.

516
00:35:30,646 --> 00:35:32,910
But such things have no effect on me...

517
00:35:33,082 --> 00:35:36,176
...for I am a poet as much as a warrior.

518
00:35:37,587 --> 00:35:39,077
If you will...

519
00:35:39,255 --> 00:35:42,281
<i>Though his nursemaid tells him no</i>

520
00:35:42,458 --> 00:35:44,255
<i>The boy will not be tamed</i>

521
00:35:44,427 --> 00:35:47,419
<i>He flies off into danger</i>

522
00:35:47,597 --> 00:35:51,658
<i>To be battered, bruised and maimed</i>

523
00:35:52,268 --> 00:35:54,600
Just because it's sung
doesn't make it a song.

524
00:35:54,771 --> 00:35:57,103
That poem just came to me,
if you can believe it.

525
00:35:57,273 --> 00:35:59,935
- I think they can believe it.
- It's a gift.

526
00:36:01,144 --> 00:36:05,911
Right, well, sounds like we've got
a long journey, so...

527
00:36:06,082 --> 00:36:07,106
Mrs. P?

528
00:36:08,184 --> 00:36:10,277
Look, you know it's what
Da would want.

529
00:36:10,453 --> 00:36:12,284
That's just why I'm coming with you.

530
00:36:12,455 --> 00:36:15,117
What? No! Please do not leave us here.

531
00:36:15,291 --> 00:36:17,953
Yes, you're the first new souls
we've seen in eight moons.

532
00:36:18,127 --> 00:36:21,255
If I have to hear any more
of his ridiculous owl jokes...

533
00:36:21,430 --> 00:36:22,920
- They're a hoot!
- They are not.

534
00:36:23,099 --> 00:36:26,535
Well, if I have to hear him play
one more quote-unquote "song"...

535
00:36:26,702 --> 00:36:28,397
...I'm gonna tear my gizzard out!

536
00:36:28,571 --> 00:36:30,664
TWILIGHT: How dare you?!
Let's get out.

537
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:32,330
Please. Please don't go!

538
00:36:33,409 --> 00:36:37,072
Do you even know the way
to the Sea of Hoolemere?

539
00:36:38,147 --> 00:36:41,014
- Twilight knows the way.
- Of course I know the way.

540
00:36:41,184 --> 00:36:44,051
We are off to the Sea of Hooladance.

541
00:36:44,220 --> 00:36:46,745
- It's "Hoolemere."
- Hoolemere.

542
00:36:49,926 --> 00:36:53,657
Hey, you know, Mrs. P,
you might be the first snake ever to fly.

543
00:36:53,830 --> 00:36:55,991
You know, I think I am.

544
00:36:56,732 --> 00:36:59,860
And I quite like it too.

545
00:37:00,036 --> 00:37:02,504
Oh, my!

546
00:37:47,216 --> 00:37:48,513
OWL:
Shove it.

547
00:37:51,787 --> 00:37:53,721
- My lord.
Hm?

548
00:37:53,890 --> 00:37:56,984
Our work at St. Aegolius
is very nearly done.

549
00:37:57,393 --> 00:37:59,884
The last of the flecks are on their way.

550
00:38:00,062 --> 00:38:03,930
And I've brought you an offering
with beating hearts.

551
00:38:04,100 --> 00:38:07,695
Your new soldiers. Tested and pure.

552
00:38:08,404 --> 00:38:12,101
One in particular shows
exceptional promise.

553
00:38:12,541 --> 00:38:14,202
I'll be the judge of that.

554
00:38:14,510 --> 00:38:16,501
You. Soldier.

555
00:38:17,213 --> 00:38:18,805
Step forward.

556
00:38:20,549 --> 00:38:23,279
Yes, you're right to be afraid
in my presence.

557
00:38:23,452 --> 00:38:24,714
What is your name?

558
00:38:25,621 --> 00:38:27,646
- Kludd.
Speak up.

559
00:38:27,823 --> 00:38:30,758
Ahem. Kludd! My name is Kludd.

560
00:38:30,927 --> 00:38:32,952
There. That's better.

561
00:38:33,129 --> 00:38:36,792
Remember, weakness is for
the lower species...

562
00:38:36,966 --> 00:38:39,730
...never for us.

563
00:38:39,902 --> 00:38:41,767
Do you know why, Kludd?

564
00:38:43,940 --> 00:38:47,398
Because we are Tytos.

565
00:38:53,950 --> 00:38:55,144
Oh, I got another one.

566
00:38:55,318 --> 00:38:56,717
- Knock, knock.
TWILIGHT: Please don't respond.

567
00:38:56,886 --> 00:38:58,581
Who's there?
TWILIGHT: Don't encourage him.

568
00:38:58,754 --> 00:39:00,085
Owls.
Owls who?

569
00:39:00,256 --> 00:39:02,986
TWILIGHT: Here it comes.
Ha, that's right. Owls whoo!

570
00:39:03,159 --> 00:39:04,183
TWILIGHT:
I told you.

571
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:06,590
Because owls whoo. Funny.
TWILIGHT: Absolutely pathetic.

572
00:39:06,762 --> 00:39:08,696
It's a very complex one, but it's...

573
00:39:15,137 --> 00:39:19,369
<i>As the night falls, so do we</i>

574
00:39:20,009 --> 00:39:22,136
<i>We fall asleep</i>

575
00:39:22,845 --> 00:39:25,177
<i>We fall asleep</i>

576
00:39:33,956 --> 00:39:35,981
<i>We continue to fall asleep</i>

577
00:39:36,325 --> 00:39:39,817
<i>We fall asleep</i>

578
00:39:40,663 --> 00:39:43,655
<i>For dreams, they come on high!</i>

579
00:39:43,833 --> 00:39:45,664
Shh! Shh!

580
00:39:48,337 --> 00:39:51,101
<i>We are now asleep</i>

581
00:39:51,707 --> 00:39:57,703
<i>We are now asleep</i>

582
00:39:58,080 --> 00:39:59,445
Shh!

583
00:40:08,491 --> 00:40:10,982
You know,
I think that crow is following us.

584
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:13,492
Yes. I've had my eye on him for a while.

585
00:40:15,464 --> 00:40:17,728
Know what an owl says
when he's pecked by a crow?

586
00:40:17,900 --> 00:40:19,561
TWILIGHT:
Really, Digger, must you?

587
00:40:19,735 --> 00:40:21,703
Ow!
- That's right, "Ow"!

588
00:40:23,005 --> 00:40:25,269
Hey! Get out of here!

589
00:40:26,942 --> 00:40:28,671
Oh, that is it.

590
00:40:28,844 --> 00:40:30,277
Twilight! Your lute!

591
00:40:30,479 --> 00:40:32,344
Oh, let them have it. Good riddance.

592
00:40:32,515 --> 00:40:34,915
- Oh, wait. Oh, no!
- Oh, yes!

593
00:40:35,384 --> 00:40:36,544
Mrs. P!

594
00:40:36,719 --> 00:40:37,777
TWILIGHT:
Come on!

595
00:40:42,925 --> 00:40:45,553
Mrs. P! I'm coming!

596
00:40:49,231 --> 00:40:50,755
Soren, look!

597
00:40:54,937 --> 00:40:56,199
Help!

598
00:40:56,639 --> 00:40:57,697
They're too fast.

599
00:40:57,873 --> 00:41:00,068
I'll get you closer.
We're going to lock talons!

600
00:41:00,242 --> 00:41:02,403
What?
- Trust me! I know what I'm doing!

601
00:41:02,578 --> 00:41:04,273
Yeah, but have you done this before?

602
00:41:04,447 --> 00:41:06,881
No, but I've always wanted to try it!

603
00:41:07,049 --> 00:41:08,141
Hold on!

604
00:41:14,023 --> 00:41:15,422
Mrs. P!

605
00:41:16,158 --> 00:41:18,058
Get out of here! Begone!

606
00:41:23,032 --> 00:41:25,159
Oh, Mrs. P. Are you okay?

607
00:41:25,334 --> 00:41:27,234
Quite a ride.

608
00:41:27,903 --> 00:41:29,803
Let's do that again.

609
00:41:31,307 --> 00:41:34,174
Owl, you surely can fly.

610
00:41:34,343 --> 00:41:36,140
Thank you, Twilight.

611
00:41:36,312 --> 00:41:39,907
Well, here we are.

612
00:41:48,924 --> 00:41:50,949
The Sea of Hoolemere.

613
00:41:51,861 --> 00:41:54,421
It's just so big.

614
00:41:54,797 --> 00:41:57,459
Yes, it's a right big puddle there.

615
00:41:57,700 --> 00:41:59,167
I don't know.

616
00:41:59,335 --> 00:42:01,496
You really think the Guardians
are out there?

617
00:42:01,971 --> 00:42:03,131
They have to be.

618
00:42:03,305 --> 00:42:04,363
The band!

619
00:42:04,573 --> 00:42:05,631
- Finally.
- Who's there?

620
00:42:05,808 --> 00:42:07,673
Your arrival 'twas foretold.

621
00:42:07,843 --> 00:42:10,937
'Twas foretold trespassers
would land on my shore.

622
00:42:11,113 --> 00:42:12,546
Look, we mean you no harm.

623
00:42:12,715 --> 00:42:14,478
Yes. 'Twas foretold as well.

624
00:42:14,650 --> 00:42:17,141
- We've flown a long way.
- Also foretold.

625
00:42:17,319 --> 00:42:19,549
- And we're very tired.
- Foretold!

626
00:42:19,722 --> 00:42:20,848
I know all.

627
00:42:21,023 --> 00:42:23,287
Now, state your desire, owl.

628
00:42:23,459 --> 00:42:24,551
- Well...
- wait.

629
00:42:24,727 --> 00:42:27,662
If you really know all,
then how come you don't know that?

630
00:42:27,830 --> 00:42:31,231
Ah! 'Twas foretold there would be
one who doubts.

631
00:42:32,334 --> 00:42:34,199
Is anyone else having trouble with this?

632
00:42:34,370 --> 00:42:35,701
Yes, I kind of am.

633
00:42:35,871 --> 00:42:39,466
Da said, "guided by the spines
of the echidna."

634
00:42:39,642 --> 00:42:41,701
Wait! Wait, you're an echidna!

635
00:42:41,877 --> 00:42:43,367
I am the echidna.

636
00:42:43,546 --> 00:42:46,640
And it was foretold you would need
some help getting here.

637
00:42:46,815 --> 00:42:49,841
Well, then, I should tell you,
we seek the Guardians.

638
00:42:50,019 --> 00:42:51,486
He should already know that.

639
00:42:51,654 --> 00:42:54,088
I do, doubter. Go on.

640
00:42:54,256 --> 00:42:55,883
Da said your spines can guide us.

641
00:42:56,058 --> 00:42:57,082
And they will.

642
00:42:57,259 --> 00:43:02,322
Now, to reach the Tree, keep between
the whale's Fin and the Eye of Glaux.

643
00:43:02,498 --> 00:43:04,898
Never go outside those stars.

644
00:43:07,169 --> 00:43:08,864
Now, go! All of you.

645
00:43:14,276 --> 00:43:17,677
'Twas foretold that the band
would hesitate.

646
00:43:18,247 --> 00:43:21,273
But that in time would become a family.

647
00:43:21,450 --> 00:43:25,682
And a family needs all of its members
to play their parts.

648
00:43:25,854 --> 00:43:27,082
The warrior.

649
00:43:27,256 --> 00:43:29,053
Poet warrior, please. Thank you.

650
00:43:29,792 --> 00:43:31,919
Fine, strong and noble.

651
00:43:32,294 --> 00:43:34,956
The tracker, sturdy and faithful.

652
00:43:35,164 --> 00:43:37,564
The navigator, who doubts.

653
00:43:37,766 --> 00:43:40,963
The leader, whose gizzard is strong.

654
00:43:41,170 --> 00:43:44,833
And finally, of course, the heart.

655
00:43:45,808 --> 00:43:47,935
Wait. Are you a snake?

656
00:43:48,110 --> 00:43:49,407
Yes, I am.

657
00:43:52,081 --> 00:43:55,380
You've all come this far,
each protecting the other.

658
00:43:55,551 --> 00:43:59,180
So go. Look to the sky, and fly.

659
00:44:00,623 --> 00:44:02,818
All right. Let's go.

660
00:44:05,060 --> 00:44:07,927
Remember, when your wings are weak...

661
00:44:08,097 --> 00:44:10,065
...your spirits done...

662
00:44:10,232 --> 00:44:12,632
...and you've flown as far as you can...

663
00:44:12,801 --> 00:44:15,634
...you're halfway there!

664
00:44:16,005 --> 00:44:17,097
What did he say?

665
00:44:17,273 --> 00:44:20,106
We're halfway there! Oh, yeah.

666
00:44:20,276 --> 00:44:23,109
Woo-hoo! This is gonna be a breeze.

667
00:44:26,815 --> 00:44:28,009
We're lost!

668
00:44:28,817 --> 00:44:30,785
I can't find my bearings.

669
00:44:31,854 --> 00:44:33,651
We have to find the island!

670
00:44:33,822 --> 00:44:35,119
We're in the mist.

671
00:44:35,291 --> 00:44:38,852
The Tree must be on the other side.
I can feel it in my gizzard!

672
00:44:39,028 --> 00:44:40,290
Your gizzard?

673
00:44:40,462 --> 00:44:45,798
Does anyone else have any more solid
information about how much further it is?

674
00:44:45,968 --> 00:44:48,129
Digger, why are you flying like that?

675
00:44:48,304 --> 00:44:50,795
Like what? You know how I fly.

676
00:44:50,973 --> 00:44:52,133
TWILIGHT:
It's not that!

677
00:44:52,308 --> 00:44:54,037
Digger! Your wings!

678
00:44:55,344 --> 00:44:56,971
I think...

679
00:44:57,780 --> 00:44:58,872
Goodbye.

680
00:44:59,648 --> 00:45:01,343
- Digger.
- Digger!

681
00:45:02,484 --> 00:45:04,850
Aah! Digger!

682
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:20,862
Digger? Digger.

683
00:45:21,570 --> 00:45:23,561
Oh, no. No.

684
00:45:44,526 --> 00:45:45,857
Can you fly with me?

685
00:45:46,895 --> 00:45:48,260
There are...

686
00:45:48,430 --> 00:45:49,988
There are five of us.

687
00:45:50,165 --> 00:45:51,928
Yes. We know.

688
00:47:24,426 --> 00:47:26,360
OWL 1:
Can you see what's happening?

689
00:47:27,629 --> 00:47:29,597
OWL 2:
Out of my way, I can't see.

690
00:47:29,765 --> 00:47:32,461
OWL 3: I can't hear a thing.
OWL 4: Shh!

691
00:47:32,634 --> 00:47:33,658
OWL 2:
I wanna see!

692
00:47:33,836 --> 00:47:37,135
I'm concerned about this
fleck material of which they speak.

693
00:47:37,306 --> 00:47:39,740
It could be a weapon.
Could be a new shield or armor.

694
00:47:39,908 --> 00:47:41,637
Having examined them, Your Majesty...

695
00:47:41,810 --> 00:47:44,142
...they do show signs
of the trials they described.

696
00:47:44,313 --> 00:47:49,341
It beggars belief to think that these brave
owlets would fly here by themselves...

697
00:47:49,518 --> 00:47:50,780
...to spin a fairy tale.

698
00:47:50,953 --> 00:47:53,615
Heh-heh-heh.
- Does my Lord Allomere feel otherwise?

699
00:47:53,789 --> 00:47:55,450
Oh, good Glaux.

700
00:47:55,824 --> 00:47:58,987
Boron, Your Majesty,
if I understand this correctly...

701
00:47:59,161 --> 00:48:01,391
...Metal Beak is not a myth...

702
00:48:01,563 --> 00:48:04,498
...he's building a slave army
of moon-blinked owlets...

703
00:48:04,666 --> 00:48:09,365
...and is planning to conquer the world
with magical pellet debris.

704
00:48:10,639 --> 00:48:12,266
Without intending any disrespect...

705
00:48:12,441 --> 00:48:16,207
...and particularly to my little friends,
who have been through so much...

706
00:48:16,712 --> 00:48:21,308
...such a story simply stretches
plausibility too far.

707
00:48:23,685 --> 00:48:27,052
Does that notion strike Ezylryb
as amusing?

708
00:48:27,222 --> 00:48:28,246
What cheek!

709
00:48:28,457 --> 00:48:33,394
What's amusing to me is that you would
cover yourself by besmirching these fliers.

710
00:48:33,562 --> 00:48:36,690
Perhaps my good fellow Ezylryb
wishes us to race back to war.

711
00:48:36,865 --> 00:48:38,059
No, no.

712
00:48:38,233 --> 00:48:41,930
Perhaps he'd write a poem about it
from his hollow, while the rest of us...

713
00:48:42,104 --> 00:48:45,699
well, while the rest of us
had our talons deformed too.

714
00:48:45,874 --> 00:48:48,138
- Uh-huh.
- But I say caution...

715
00:48:48,310 --> 00:48:49,868
...when the losses could be so many.

716
00:48:51,380 --> 00:48:54,144
I would never counsel
rushing blindly into war...

717
00:48:54,316 --> 00:48:56,841
...but for a cause such as the one
the boy described...

718
00:48:57,019 --> 00:48:59,487
...for a violation of peace
so blatant, so powerful...

719
00:48:59,655 --> 00:49:00,747
...of course I'd fight!

720
00:49:00,923 --> 00:49:02,413
What other course to take?

721
00:49:02,858 --> 00:49:07,227
And if you think I'm a coward, or I'd simply
urge others on, I'll fight you right now.

722
00:49:07,396 --> 00:49:09,261
Order.
- Boron, you can judge the winner.

723
00:49:09,431 --> 00:49:11,899
Mildly, owls.
We're trying to seek the truth.

724
00:49:12,067 --> 00:49:13,466
The truth?

725
00:49:13,635 --> 00:49:15,262
I told you the truth.

726
00:49:15,437 --> 00:49:17,632
The Pure Ones exist.

727
00:49:17,806 --> 00:49:21,367
They've kidnapped me and dozens
of owlets from our hollows.

728
00:49:21,543 --> 00:49:24,910
They want to enslave us all
and rule our world without pity.

729
00:49:27,516 --> 00:49:30,781
Yes, the only proof I have are my words.

730
00:49:30,953 --> 00:49:34,081
But words were the only proof I ever had
that you were real.

731
00:49:35,057 --> 00:49:36,957
And still, I believed.

732
00:49:38,160 --> 00:49:40,628
And you would argue with that?

733
00:49:42,331 --> 00:49:43,628
I will not argue with it.

734
00:49:43,799 --> 00:49:45,926
Your Majesty,
my search and rescue chaw...

735
00:49:46,101 --> 00:49:49,468
...is scheduled to leave on a routine
survey during the next full moon.

736
00:49:49,638 --> 00:49:51,105
No.
- Perhaps we could...

737
00:49:51,273 --> 00:49:52,638
You shall leave immediately.

738
00:49:52,808 --> 00:49:56,471
Take your best owls with you, Allomere.
And be thorough.

739
00:50:06,989 --> 00:50:08,115
Wow.

740
00:50:08,290 --> 00:50:10,588
Soren, we did it.

741
00:50:10,759 --> 00:50:12,989
Yeah. Yeah, I guess we did.

742
00:50:14,329 --> 00:50:16,923
I just hope Allomere finds the owlets.

743
00:50:18,333 --> 00:50:21,302
Oh, to be a young owl
with a taste for adventure...

744
00:50:21,470 --> 00:50:23,802
...arriving to the Tree for the first time.

745
00:50:24,172 --> 00:50:26,800
Well done to hold your own in there.

746
00:50:27,142 --> 00:50:29,667
Some more nice strong gizzards.

747
00:50:30,078 --> 00:50:31,841
The Tree always needs them.

748
00:50:34,182 --> 00:50:36,650
He is one strange owl.

749
00:50:36,818 --> 00:50:39,685
I think he might be missing a few talons.

750
00:50:39,855 --> 00:50:41,220
And a good bath.

751
00:50:41,390 --> 00:50:42,857
Gross old owl.

752
00:50:43,025 --> 00:50:44,993
You'll want to stay out of his chaw.

753
00:50:45,160 --> 00:50:48,323
- Chaw?
- I'll tell you on the way to dinner.

754
00:50:49,097 --> 00:50:50,894
You're already late.

755
00:51:01,376 --> 00:51:02,400
OWL:
Look out!

756
00:51:02,577 --> 00:51:06,673
Now, Matron's instructed me to give you lot
a rundown on the way we do things here.

757
00:51:06,848 --> 00:51:08,213
During your basic training...

758
00:51:08,383 --> 00:51:10,180
wait, wait, wait. Basic training?

759
00:51:10,352 --> 00:51:13,753
You don't just become a Guardian
overnight. It takes years. Years.

760
00:51:14,122 --> 00:51:16,249
- Hello.
Only our absolute best...

761
00:51:16,425 --> 00:51:18,757
...are chosen to be...
- wait. Who are you?

762
00:51:18,927 --> 00:51:20,861
Are you going to keep interrupting me?

763
00:51:22,064 --> 00:51:24,589
Now, if, however unlikely,
you do have talent...

764
00:51:25,133 --> 00:51:28,398
...you'll be tapped, or selected,
for a specialized chaw, or squadron.

765
00:51:29,237 --> 00:51:32,604
There's navigation, healing,
search and rescue...

766
00:51:32,774 --> 00:51:36,073
...blacksmithing, weather interpretation,
colliering.

767
00:51:36,244 --> 00:51:39,839
I expect to be placed in
the navigation chaw myself.

768
00:51:40,282 --> 00:51:42,045
Name's Otulissa, by the way.

769
00:51:42,217 --> 00:51:44,845
I'm... I'm Soren. Heh.

770
00:51:46,922 --> 00:51:49,083
I believe your friends are in there.

771
00:51:52,794 --> 00:51:55,092
Digger! Hi!

772
00:52:03,171 --> 00:52:04,433
How's the food, Digger?

773
00:52:07,075 --> 00:52:11,205
He said "good," but he thinks
it'll go better with a little music.

774
00:52:11,379 --> 00:52:14,746
- What?
- And this looks like a decent crowd.

775
00:52:16,418 --> 00:52:18,079
He's actually pretty good, you know.

776
00:52:18,253 --> 00:52:21,051
Oh, I guess. If you like that sort of thing.

777
00:52:24,259 --> 00:52:25,726
Here at the Great Tree...

778
00:52:25,894 --> 00:52:30,228
...every owl trains in different skills
we call "chaws."

779
00:52:30,398 --> 00:52:31,990
You'll study tracking...

780
00:52:32,234 --> 00:52:33,826
...navigating, combat.

781
00:52:34,002 --> 00:52:35,799
But maybe you're a blacksmith.

782
00:52:46,248 --> 00:52:47,840
Here I come, here I come.

783
00:52:49,151 --> 00:52:50,550
Digger!

784
00:52:51,453 --> 00:52:53,444
Ow! Hey! Hold it!

785
00:52:53,622 --> 00:52:56,090
Hang on, hang on. Ow!

786
00:53:40,468 --> 00:53:43,835
Fire, boy. It's the lifeblood of the Tree.

787
00:53:44,005 --> 00:53:46,974
There's nothing more dangerous. Hm?

788
00:53:48,376 --> 00:53:49,400
STRIX STRUMA:
Owls.

789
00:53:52,781 --> 00:53:54,476
You must be joking.

790
00:53:57,986 --> 00:53:59,419
Preposterous!

791
00:53:59,588 --> 00:54:01,715
Come back here! I wasn't ready.

792
00:54:04,659 --> 00:54:06,149
Feel the air!

793
00:54:06,895 --> 00:54:08,226
Follow me.

794
00:54:28,750 --> 00:54:32,242
My soldiers, my sons...

795
00:54:32,420 --> 00:54:36,015
...many of you have heard of me
in late-night whisperings...

796
00:54:36,191 --> 00:54:40,093
...but I assure you, I am not a myth.

797
00:54:40,829 --> 00:54:42,296
I am real.

798
00:54:42,464 --> 00:54:46,730
And I stand before you
with one simple truth:

799
00:54:47,235 --> 00:54:50,534
The strong shall rule the weak.

800
00:54:52,841 --> 00:54:58,143
Long ago, I was viciously attacked
by the coward Lyze of Kiel...

801
00:54:58,346 --> 00:55:01,042
...for defending that truth.

802
00:55:01,650 --> 00:55:05,746
Now I wear this mask
to conceal my scars.

803
00:55:05,921 --> 00:55:09,084
But the metal is strong.

804
00:55:09,991 --> 00:55:15,258
It is a symbol of the Pure Ones'
strength and resolve.

805
00:55:15,430 --> 00:55:20,094
It is time to set a fire that will consume
the owl kingdoms...

806
00:55:20,268 --> 00:55:23,726
...and take back what is rightfully ours!

807
00:55:23,905 --> 00:55:26,237
Because we are Tytos!

808
00:55:26,875 --> 00:55:29,469
We are Pure Ones!

809
00:55:30,011 --> 00:55:33,344
And I am Metal Beak!

810
00:55:33,581 --> 00:55:35,640
<i>Metal Beak. Metal Beak.</i>

811
00:55:35,817 --> 00:55:37,580
<i>Metal Beak. Metal Beak.</i>

812
00:55:37,752 --> 00:55:39,481
<i>Kludd?
- Metal Beak.</i>

813
00:55:39,654 --> 00:55:40,814
<i>- Kludd.
- Metal Beak.</i>

814
00:55:40,989 --> 00:55:43,116
I miss Ma and Da.

815
00:55:43,425 --> 00:55:44,653
I'm scared.

816
00:55:45,226 --> 00:55:47,194
Don't be. You're with me now.

817
00:55:47,395 --> 00:55:49,829
Eglantine, this is our home.

818
00:55:49,998 --> 00:55:52,330
They really appreciate us here.

819
00:55:52,500 --> 00:55:55,196
Kludd, please,
could we just go find Soren?

820
00:55:55,370 --> 00:55:58,100
Hey, hey! Forget about Soren.

821
00:55:58,273 --> 00:56:00,833
Soren's weak. We're Tytos.

822
00:56:02,644 --> 00:56:04,043
Pure Ones.

823
00:56:04,679 --> 00:56:08,945
Kludd, I promise I won't tell anyone
what you're doing.

824
00:56:09,117 --> 00:56:10,880
I just wanna go home.

825
00:56:11,052 --> 00:56:12,485
All right, Eg.

826
00:56:12,654 --> 00:56:15,054
So we could go? When?

827
00:56:15,223 --> 00:56:16,451
Tomorrow.

828
00:56:17,425 --> 00:56:19,518
But first, tonight...

829
00:56:19,694 --> 00:56:21,184
...just sleep.

830
00:56:38,446 --> 00:56:41,006
Doing some wee-hours reading, eh?

831
00:56:41,182 --> 00:56:43,343
Yeah. It's the Battle of the Ice Claws.

832
00:56:43,518 --> 00:56:45,816
You know, this is my da's favorite story.

833
00:56:46,087 --> 00:56:48,078
He used to tell it to us all the time.

834
00:56:48,323 --> 00:56:50,848
Well, your da had good taste in authors.

835
00:56:51,526 --> 00:56:52,720
You enjoying it?

836
00:56:52,894 --> 00:56:56,022
Honestly, it's not at all like my da told it.

837
00:56:56,197 --> 00:56:58,028
No? How did he tell it?

838
00:56:58,199 --> 00:57:00,724
Well, Da always made it seem so heroic.

839
00:57:00,902 --> 00:57:02,995
You know? Like a great victory.

840
00:57:03,171 --> 00:57:06,106
Well, in these chronicles, I mean,
the battle just sounds like...

841
00:57:06,274 --> 00:57:07,502
Like hell?

842
00:57:09,911 --> 00:57:12,436
Come on, boy. It's almost first light.

843
00:57:12,614 --> 00:57:14,707
You've got a big day tomorrow.

844
00:57:14,883 --> 00:57:18,182
I'm going to teach you how to really fly.

845
00:57:21,122 --> 00:57:24,785
Feel the gutters! The currents in the rain.

846
00:57:27,429 --> 00:57:28,555
A scupper!

847
00:57:28,730 --> 00:57:29,890
A swillage!

848
00:57:30,065 --> 00:57:31,225
Baggywrinkles!

849
00:57:31,599 --> 00:57:32,964
"Baggywrinkles"?

850
00:57:33,134 --> 00:57:35,625
He could have at least given us
a vocabulary list.

851
00:57:35,804 --> 00:57:39,205
EZYLRYB:
Now, this, this is the way to learn!

852
00:57:39,374 --> 00:57:42,070
Oh, yes! This is exactly how
I want to learn.

853
00:57:42,243 --> 00:57:43,369
In a monsoon!

854
00:57:47,816 --> 00:57:50,808
EZYLRYB: The air currents warm
in different ways, you see...

855
00:57:51,019 --> 00:57:53,112
...from the sky to the ocean.

856
00:57:53,288 --> 00:57:54,915
You can't fight them.

857
00:57:55,090 --> 00:57:58,253
You have to feel them
with your gizzards.

858
00:58:01,162 --> 00:58:03,460
Aha! You see that one?

859
00:58:03,631 --> 00:58:05,292
Soren, see it! It's there.

860
00:58:05,467 --> 00:58:07,094
Go for it.

861
00:58:07,635 --> 00:58:10,229
That's it! Use your gizzard, boy.

862
00:58:10,405 --> 00:58:11,770
Trust it!

863
00:58:11,940 --> 00:58:14,534
Fly inside.

864
00:58:26,154 --> 00:58:27,746
He sees it.

865
00:58:28,823 --> 00:58:30,256
He sees it.

866
00:58:48,343 --> 00:58:50,811
Hold it. Hold it.

867
00:58:56,618 --> 00:58:59,917
Soren. Hey, hey, hey!
Hey, careful, look out!

868
00:59:00,088 --> 00:59:02,283
Soren!
EZYLRYB: Soren!

869
00:59:11,299 --> 00:59:13,494
Owl, come to my hollow.

870
00:59:17,872 --> 00:59:19,669
So lean back, put your beaks up...

871
00:59:19,841 --> 00:59:23,436
...and turn your faces to the light
of the glorious full moon...

872
00:59:23,645 --> 00:59:24,873
...and sleep.

873
00:59:25,046 --> 00:59:28,573
OWL: Lord Allomere, the boy was right.
Those owlets, we have to rescue them.

874
00:59:28,750 --> 00:59:30,945
Caution. We mustn't rush in blindly.

875
00:59:31,152 --> 00:59:33,279
We don't know what we're up against.

876
00:59:36,090 --> 00:59:37,717
Now, see those bats?

877
00:59:38,193 --> 00:59:42,391
Follow them. I'll wager we'll discover
the full extent of their plan.

878
00:59:53,408 --> 00:59:54,602
Hold!

879
01:00:04,419 --> 01:00:07,286
I'll take out that one, you get
the two down on the platform.

880
01:00:25,840 --> 01:00:27,102
OWL:
What is this?

881
01:00:38,087 --> 01:00:40,055
EZYLRYB:
I don't even know what I did with it.

882
01:00:40,223 --> 01:00:41,520
I don't know what happened.

883
01:00:45,662 --> 01:00:48,096
I don't know what I did. What did I do?

884
01:00:48,998 --> 01:00:52,058
We flew a great way out here
and it was nothing like that.

885
01:00:52,235 --> 01:00:54,499
You've got no reason to worry, boy.

886
01:00:54,837 --> 01:00:58,068
I confess, I guided you into
that twister on purpose.

887
01:00:58,241 --> 01:01:00,334
I wanted to test your gizzard.

888
01:01:01,244 --> 01:01:03,405
You were exemplary.

889
01:01:04,247 --> 01:01:05,407
"Exemplary"?

890
01:01:05,581 --> 01:01:08,049
No, no, no.
I nearly had my wings ripped off.

891
01:01:08,451 --> 01:01:12,353
You know, my head said to do one thing
while my gizzard was saying to do another.

892
01:01:12,522 --> 01:01:14,217
And you trusted your head.

893
01:01:15,425 --> 01:01:17,120
That's when you failed.

894
01:01:18,394 --> 01:01:21,192
Wait. Is that your mark?

895
01:01:21,464 --> 01:01:23,694
EZYLRYB:
What, this? Yes.

896
01:01:24,133 --> 01:01:27,864
<i>So you wrote the
Chronicle of the Battle of the Ice Claws.</i>

897
01:01:28,037 --> 01:01:29,402
I think so.

898
01:01:29,572 --> 01:01:31,938
Well, actually, yes. I did.

899
01:01:32,241 --> 01:01:34,368
Were you there?
EZYLRYB: Yes.

900
01:01:35,912 --> 01:01:37,209
What, as a scribe?

901
01:01:37,380 --> 01:01:40,315
EZYLRYB:
Um... well, no. As a soldier.

902
01:01:40,483 --> 01:01:44,544
As the, I guess you could say,
leader of all the soldiers.

903
01:01:45,655 --> 01:01:47,350
You're Lyze of Kiel.

904
01:01:49,859 --> 01:01:51,986
Um... Yes.

905
01:01:52,161 --> 01:01:54,152
You're Lyze of Kiel.

906
01:01:54,364 --> 01:01:55,888
Yes. Don't wear it out.

907
01:01:56,566 --> 01:01:57,726
But...

908
01:01:58,968 --> 01:02:00,560
EZYLRYB:
That old thing?

909
01:02:00,737 --> 01:02:03,501
That's only good
for gathering coals now.

910
01:02:03,673 --> 01:02:06,267
Yeah, but why go by Ezylryb?

911
01:02:06,442 --> 01:02:08,501
All the owls of the Tree know who I am.

912
01:02:08,678 --> 01:02:09,770
But you're...

913
01:02:09,946 --> 01:02:12,312
My days as Lyze are well behind me.

914
01:02:12,482 --> 01:02:15,246
And that battle is a distant memory.

915
01:02:15,418 --> 01:02:18,444
Except, funnily enough,
for young owlets like you.

916
01:02:20,023 --> 01:02:21,285
Why didn't you tell me?

917
01:02:21,457 --> 01:02:24,153
What difference does it make
what I call myself?

918
01:02:24,327 --> 01:02:26,295
Because Lyze of Kiel was my hero.

919
01:02:26,462 --> 01:02:29,693
Yes, well, fancy it must be hard
meeting your hero...

920
01:02:29,899 --> 01:02:32,493
...and seeing that he's real
and not a myth.

921
01:02:32,935 --> 01:02:34,266
You're just not...

922
01:02:34,437 --> 01:02:35,927
what did you expect?

923
01:02:36,105 --> 01:02:41,441
<i>Some Tyto alba with gleaming armor and
battle claws, the moon rising behind him?</i>

924
01:02:42,945 --> 01:02:46,278
Well, this is what it looks like
when you've actually fought in battle.

925
01:02:46,449 --> 01:02:49,850
It's not glorious, it's not beautiful.
And it's not even heroic.

926
01:02:50,019 --> 01:02:51,714
It's merely doing what's right.

927
01:02:51,921 --> 01:02:56,119
And doing it again and again,
even if someday, you look like this.

928
01:02:57,994 --> 01:02:59,018
Something's wrong.

929
01:03:06,536 --> 01:03:09,471
OWL 1:
Downed owlets, downed owlets!

930
01:03:09,639 --> 01:03:12,073
- Come fast!
OWL 2: Allomere is back!

931
01:03:12,241 --> 01:03:13,902
Quickly.
OWL 3: Make way.

932
01:03:14,077 --> 01:03:15,977
Some help here.

933
01:03:16,145 --> 01:03:18,010
These owlets need attention.

934
01:03:18,181 --> 01:03:19,478
Fetch it, quick.

935
01:03:22,318 --> 01:03:24,684
- Mommy?
- It's okay.

936
01:03:25,154 --> 01:03:26,849
Hey. Hey. What happened?

937
01:03:27,023 --> 01:03:29,457
Lord Allomere rescued two owlets
in the Beaks.

938
01:03:30,359 --> 01:03:32,190
It looks like he's hurt.

939
01:03:33,262 --> 01:03:36,197
I think he ran into
some of your Pure Ones.

940
01:03:36,365 --> 01:03:39,459
You know, I didn't really
believe you before.

941
01:03:39,869 --> 01:03:43,805
Oh, well, that's okay. You know,
I wouldn't have believed me either.

942
01:03:44,974 --> 01:03:48,205
Soren! Soren, come fast, it's Eglantine.

943
01:03:49,278 --> 01:03:50,745
Eglantine?

944
01:03:51,380 --> 01:03:53,280
Let me through! Let me pass!

945
01:03:53,483 --> 01:03:54,541
OWL 4:
Been moon blinked.

946
01:03:58,554 --> 01:03:59,851
No.

947
01:04:02,191 --> 01:04:03,783
Do you think you can help her?

948
01:04:03,993 --> 01:04:05,790
We will do our best, Soren.

949
01:04:08,698 --> 01:04:10,131
Eglantine.

950
01:04:13,436 --> 01:04:14,869
Eglantine.

951
01:04:15,705 --> 01:04:18,902
<i>The battle was ferocious.
We were greatly outnumbered.</i>

952
01:04:19,242 --> 01:04:22,973
I was only lightly wounded, thank Glaux.
But the others...

953
01:04:25,014 --> 01:04:27,949
Can you estimate the number
of enslaved owlets, Allomere?

954
01:04:28,384 --> 01:04:32,650
Scores, that I witnessed.
There may well be many more.

955
01:04:32,822 --> 01:04:35,757
And you believe this is part
of a larger plan.

956
01:04:36,092 --> 01:04:37,650
It is certain.

957
01:04:38,461 --> 01:04:42,227
Your Majesty, this is no time
for half measures.

958
01:04:43,065 --> 01:04:44,589
Hmm.

959
01:04:45,268 --> 01:04:48,135
Bubo, sharpen the battle claws.

960
01:04:50,806 --> 01:04:52,137
To arms.

961
01:04:53,609 --> 01:04:55,099
To arms.

962
01:05:09,158 --> 01:05:10,989
Not a bad fit.

963
01:05:11,160 --> 01:05:12,855
Ezylryb! Lyze.

964
01:05:13,062 --> 01:05:14,359
Yes to both.

965
01:05:14,564 --> 01:05:15,861
Look, I have to go.

966
01:05:16,065 --> 01:05:17,760
You have to take me with you.

967
01:05:17,934 --> 01:05:19,128
Oh, absolutely.

968
01:05:19,302 --> 01:05:23,830
An untrained youth like you could last
a whole minute in a real battle.

969
01:05:24,340 --> 01:05:25,466
Here.

970
01:05:26,676 --> 01:05:29,270
Come along.
We could use the talon fodder.

971
01:05:29,445 --> 01:05:31,606
I'd love to throw some bodies
at the enemy.

972
01:05:31,781 --> 01:05:32,805
Yeah, but I'm...

973
01:05:32,982 --> 01:05:35,780
Or you could stay here...

974
01:05:35,952 --> 01:05:37,613
...tend to your sister...

975
01:05:37,787 --> 01:05:40,187
...and do some real good.

976
01:05:41,157 --> 01:05:44,991
But what do I know?
I'm just a tired old screech.

977
01:06:38,014 --> 01:06:39,345
Move.

978
01:06:53,663 --> 01:06:54,857
<i>Oh, Eglantine.</i>

979
01:06:56,098 --> 01:06:59,431
I'd trade places with you if I could.
I really would.

980
01:06:59,602 --> 01:07:02,264
You know, I wish it was me lying there
instead of you.

981
01:07:02,438 --> 01:07:04,030
Oh, Soren.

982
01:07:04,206 --> 01:07:06,936
Because then you could see this place
for yourself, Eg.

983
01:07:07,109 --> 01:07:12,206
You know, Da's stories, they're true.
They're all true.

984
01:07:12,381 --> 01:07:15,373
<i>You know, the Guardians,
and the Ga'Hoole Tree, and...</i>

985
01:07:15,551 --> 01:07:16,916
<i>It's all true!</i>

986
01:07:17,086 --> 01:07:20,613
<i>Even Lyze of Kiel. I mean, he's real, Eg.</i>

987
01:07:21,457 --> 01:07:22,754
<i>He's real.</i>

988
01:07:38,708 --> 01:07:41,336
Soren, you promised.

989
01:07:41,510 --> 01:07:42,602
Eg?

990
01:07:44,013 --> 01:07:47,414
You promised I could be Lyze
on the next go.

991
01:07:49,352 --> 01:07:51,980
- Oh, Eglantine.
- Oh, Eglantine.

992
01:07:53,589 --> 01:07:54,920
Eglantine.

993
01:07:55,424 --> 01:07:58,018
Soren? Mrs. P?

994
01:07:58,661 --> 01:08:01,095
We're... we're not at home, are we?

995
01:08:01,263 --> 01:08:03,026
We're at the Guardian's Tree, Eg.

996
01:08:03,232 --> 01:08:05,632
Look. Look, this is Ga'Hoole.

997
01:08:05,801 --> 01:08:09,498
No, it can't be. Kludd, he's still...

998
01:08:09,672 --> 01:08:13,608
Kludd was wrong. Da was right.
He was right all along, Eg.

999
01:08:13,776 --> 01:08:17,473
No, I mean Kludd was there. With me.

1000
01:08:17,880 --> 01:08:21,611
He did this to me, Soren.
He's one of them.

1001
01:08:21,817 --> 01:08:23,182
He what?

1002
01:08:23,686 --> 01:08:25,278
No. No, Eg.

1003
01:08:25,554 --> 01:08:29,046
Look, you must be confused.
That can't be.

1004
01:08:31,394 --> 01:08:33,328
<i>Well, thank Glaux Allomere rescued you.</i>

1005
01:08:33,496 --> 01:08:35,293
<i>I wasn't rescued.</i>

1006
01:08:35,464 --> 01:08:38,490
<i>Kludd gave me to the owl
who brought me here.</i>

1007
01:08:38,667 --> 01:08:41,192
<i>No, Eg, no. That's impossible.</i>

1008
01:08:41,370 --> 01:08:44,362
<i>I mean, that would mean that Allomere
would have to be a...</i>

1009
01:08:44,540 --> 01:08:46,474
<i>Be a traitor.</i>

1010
01:08:48,210 --> 01:08:49,507
No, it's a trap.

1011
01:09:34,356 --> 01:09:35,380
Allomere!

1012
01:09:35,858 --> 01:09:37,450
Allomere!

1013
01:09:45,835 --> 01:09:49,931
We'll follow the whale's Fin.
It's how they would have gone.

1014
01:10:07,223 --> 01:10:08,247
I see something.

1015
01:10:09,391 --> 01:10:10,653
There.

1016
01:10:13,762 --> 01:10:15,696
We should check out that smoke.

1017
01:10:22,404 --> 01:10:24,133
Soren, look.

1018
01:10:40,289 --> 01:10:41,984
Oh, Allomere.

1019
01:10:42,324 --> 01:10:46,784
Is it different when you see
the consequences of your betrayal?

1020
01:10:46,962 --> 01:10:50,159
- Must it be bats that bleed them?
- Of course.

1021
01:10:50,399 --> 01:10:54,028
They have no gizzards to be impaired
by the power of the flecks.

1022
01:10:54,837 --> 01:10:56,805
Now, my love?

1023
01:10:56,972 --> 01:11:00,339
It would be cruel to make them wait
any longer.

1024
01:11:03,679 --> 01:11:05,112
Finish them.

1025
01:11:11,053 --> 01:11:14,614
Well, we can't just leave them down there,
writhing in pain.

1026
01:11:14,790 --> 01:11:16,724
- Can we?
- No, you don't understand.

1027
01:11:16,926 --> 01:11:19,793
When we were at St. Aggie's,
we saw what those things can do.

1028
01:11:19,962 --> 01:11:23,159
They do something terrible to your
gizzard. Isn't that right, Soren?

1029
01:11:24,133 --> 01:11:25,157
Soren?

1030
01:11:27,403 --> 01:11:29,462
Uh, we've got bats inbound.

1031
01:11:29,638 --> 01:11:32,539
Not to worry. I can down
a hundred of those bloodsuckers.

1032
01:11:32,708 --> 01:11:34,835
Uh... Ooh. How about a thousand?

1033
01:11:35,010 --> 01:11:38,343
TWILIGHT: Well, we won't find out sitting
on our tail feathers, will we? Come on!

1034
01:11:38,514 --> 01:11:40,379
Wait! Just wait.

1035
01:11:41,083 --> 01:11:42,812
- Of course.
- Soren, what is it?

1036
01:11:42,985 --> 01:11:45,351
The flames. That's it.

1037
01:11:45,521 --> 01:11:47,751
I think I see a way to free
the Guardians.

1038
01:11:47,957 --> 01:11:50,084
No, Soren, you can't fly into fire.

1039
01:11:50,259 --> 01:11:52,727
Listen, Gylfie, I need to trust my gizzard.

1040
01:11:52,895 --> 01:11:54,886
Twilight, can you take care of the bats?

1041
01:11:55,064 --> 01:11:57,225
Friend, I'll give you as much time
as I can.

1042
01:11:57,399 --> 01:11:59,026
But hurry. And be careful.

1043
01:12:00,603 --> 01:12:01,831
Come on!

1044
01:12:07,176 --> 01:12:10,577
Twilight, I think if we're going
into battle together...

1045
01:12:10,746 --> 01:12:13,010
...you'll have to sing
your best battle song ever.

1046
01:12:13,182 --> 01:12:15,343
- What?
- No, I'm serious. I want to hear one.

1047
01:12:15,517 --> 01:12:18,509
Give us your bravest, most inspiring
battle song ever!

1048
01:12:18,687 --> 01:12:20,416
Brilliant idea, Digger!

1049
01:12:21,991 --> 01:12:24,858
<i>Into battle we do fly</i>

1050
01:12:25,027 --> 01:12:26,051
Yeah, that's it!

1051
01:12:26,228 --> 01:12:29,459
<i>No matter if we're going to die</i>

1052
01:12:29,632 --> 01:12:31,463
what? Is that supposed to be inspiring?

1053
01:12:31,634 --> 01:12:33,829
- Wait! We haven't gotten to the best bit!
- Oh.

1054
01:12:34,603 --> 01:12:38,198
<i>TwlLIGHT
A nasty, scary death that hurts quite a lot</i>

1055
01:12:38,374 --> 01:12:41,673
<i>Even if our wings are ripped clean off</i>

1056
01:12:42,878 --> 01:12:45,210
No. No!

1057
01:12:45,381 --> 01:12:48,043
You told us you'd bring
all the Guardians.

1058
01:12:49,118 --> 01:12:51,279
But they're not Guardians.

1059
01:12:51,453 --> 01:12:52,750
Soren.

1060
01:12:52,921 --> 01:12:56,220
They have no chance
against the flecks.

1061
01:12:56,659 --> 01:13:01,221
Still, I don't think we can trust you
anymore, Allomere.

1062
01:13:01,397 --> 01:13:02,728
No.

1063
01:13:02,898 --> 01:13:05,458
No, no, you promised me.

1064
01:13:05,634 --> 01:13:08,535
You promised me I would be
King of the Tree!

1065
01:13:11,407 --> 01:13:13,898
You should know, Allomere...

1066
01:13:14,076 --> 01:13:17,170
...there is only room for one king.

1067
01:13:28,157 --> 01:13:29,317
Hey!

1068
01:13:44,073 --> 01:13:45,472
TWILIGHT:
Fly away!

1069
01:13:51,113 --> 01:13:53,206
<i>EZYLRYB:
Use your gizzard, boy!</i>

1070
01:13:53,382 --> 01:13:56,874
<i>Fly inside.</i>

1071
01:15:06,955 --> 01:15:07,944
Soren!

1072
01:15:11,527 --> 01:15:12,585
No!

1073
01:15:43,826 --> 01:15:45,157
Oh, Soren.

1074
01:15:57,272 --> 01:15:58,796
Come on, Soren.

1075
01:15:58,974 --> 01:16:03,070
That was exemplary.
But we're not finished yet, boy.

1076
01:16:03,745 --> 01:16:05,576
Oh, yeah! Woo-hoo!

1077
01:16:09,418 --> 01:16:10,851
Come on.

1078
01:16:11,019 --> 01:16:12,577
I bet you didn't count on this.

1079
01:16:18,293 --> 01:16:21,262
Ha, ha! Good job, my friends!

1080
01:16:27,236 --> 01:16:29,602
Pure Ones, attack!

1081
01:16:30,138 --> 01:16:31,605
Crush them!

1082
01:16:31,840 --> 01:16:34,331
Before they can recover!

1083
01:16:36,378 --> 01:16:39,973
Guardians, we must uphold our oath.

1084
01:16:40,148 --> 01:16:41,672
To battle!

1085
01:16:43,785 --> 01:16:46,185
I need you to stay here
with your friends...

1086
01:16:46,355 --> 01:16:48,823
...and guard these owlets.
- Huh?

1087
01:17:31,566 --> 01:17:33,158
Unh! Ha, ha!

1088
01:17:33,335 --> 01:17:34,927
Come on!

1089
01:18:16,511 --> 01:18:17,705
Kludd?

1090
01:18:21,950 --> 01:18:23,076
No.

1091
01:18:23,418 --> 01:18:24,976
Soren!

1092
01:18:35,263 --> 01:18:36,560
Kludd!

1093
01:18:51,279 --> 01:18:52,746
Hello, brother.

1094
01:18:59,621 --> 01:19:01,316
Hmm?

1095
01:19:08,230 --> 01:19:12,929
Well, the legendary Lyze of Kiel.

1096
01:19:13,535 --> 01:19:18,097
Once again, it's come down
to just you and me.

1097
01:19:19,508 --> 01:19:24,104
And now I can take my vengeance
for this.

1098
01:19:24,346 --> 01:19:28,043
You should thank me.
It appears to be an improvement.

1099
01:20:13,295 --> 01:20:16,423
Your precious Guardians
are finished, Soren.

1100
01:20:18,433 --> 01:20:19,832
The Pure Ones will triumph...

1101
01:20:20,335 --> 01:20:25,170
...and Tytos will take their rightful place
as rulers of the owl kingdoms.

1102
01:20:25,340 --> 01:20:27,774
Oh, it's gonna be glorious!

1103
01:20:32,914 --> 01:20:33,938
"Glorious"?

1104
01:20:34,916 --> 01:20:38,181
No, the Pure Ones are monsters.
You saw what they were doing.

1105
01:20:38,353 --> 01:20:41,516
They were moon blinking other owls
and turning them into slaves.

1106
01:20:41,690 --> 01:20:44,887
You're just weak, Soren.
Still living in your dreams.

1107
01:20:46,027 --> 01:20:48,518
No, my dreams are what
make me strong, Kludd.

1108
01:20:48,697 --> 01:20:51,222
- They led me to the Guardians.
- Ha-ha-ha.

1109
01:20:51,399 --> 01:20:54,129
A pity there won't be any Guardians
left after today.

1110
01:20:57,772 --> 01:20:59,069
I don't understand.

1111
01:20:59,241 --> 01:21:02,039
How could you join the Pure Ones
after what they did to us?

1112
01:21:02,210 --> 01:21:03,734
"What they did to us"?

1113
01:21:03,912 --> 01:21:06,779
They believe in me
like no one else ever has.

1114
01:21:07,549 --> 01:21:10,746
Metal Beak says
the strong will triumph...

1115
01:21:10,919 --> 01:21:13,217
...the broken are put out of their misery.

1116
01:21:13,788 --> 01:21:14,914
And honor...

1117
01:21:15,090 --> 01:21:17,991
...honor is just another word
for weakness!

1118
01:21:18,160 --> 01:21:20,754
No, Kludd!
I know you don't really think that.

1119
01:21:21,463 --> 01:21:23,988
Then you don't know me at all.

1120
01:21:33,141 --> 01:21:36,110
Soren! My wing's broken! Help me up!

1121
01:21:39,314 --> 01:21:41,612
Soren, I'm your brother.

1122
01:22:04,606 --> 01:22:05,937
Kludd, no!

1123
01:22:17,652 --> 01:22:19,142
Metal Beak.

1124
01:22:44,012 --> 01:22:46,446
Be done with it, then.

1125
01:22:47,916 --> 01:22:49,281
No!

1126
01:22:56,358 --> 01:22:59,054
I'm not letting you hurt one more soul.

1127
01:22:59,227 --> 01:23:01,821
Oh, you're not letting me?

1128
01:23:01,997 --> 01:23:04,431
Oh, what a pity to waste...

1129
01:23:04,599 --> 01:23:08,501
...such a strong, young
and confident Tyto.

1130
01:23:10,505 --> 01:23:12,496
No, Soren!

1131
01:23:12,674 --> 01:23:15,734
Oh. You know this sad old owl.

1132
01:23:15,910 --> 01:23:18,845
He's my teacher. My hero.

1133
01:23:19,014 --> 01:23:24,179
Well, your hero can teach you one
last lesson about Pure Ones' strength...

1134
01:23:24,352 --> 01:23:25,614
Don't move.

1135
01:23:25,787 --> 01:23:28,654
...by letting you watch him die.

1136
01:24:19,341 --> 01:24:21,002
Hmm.

1137
01:24:21,176 --> 01:24:23,872
Unh!
Ha, ha.

1138
01:24:40,829 --> 01:24:43,297
Pure Ones! Fall back!

1139
01:24:43,465 --> 01:24:44,591
To me!

1140
01:25:06,121 --> 01:25:08,589
Soren, you did what was right.

1141
01:25:09,657 --> 01:25:11,488
And you did it well.

1142
01:25:13,695 --> 01:25:17,256
<i>It seems we will have to amend
the Chronicles. Huh?</i>

1143
01:25:20,869 --> 01:25:23,497
<i>As it was in the old ages...</i>

1144
01:25:23,671 --> 01:25:25,730
<i>...so it was in the new.</i>

1145
01:25:26,174 --> 01:25:28,836
<i>The Guardians upheld their oath
that night.</i>

1146
01:25:29,010 --> 01:25:31,945
I foretold you so!

1147
01:25:32,113 --> 01:25:35,879
<i>They made strong the weak
and mended the broken.</i>

1148
01:25:36,050 --> 01:25:38,075
<i>And when the sun shone again
that morning...</i>

1149
01:25:38,253 --> 01:25:41,313
<i>...all could see that
they had vanquished the evil.</i>

1150
01:25:46,561 --> 01:25:48,791
Soren! Soren!

1151
01:25:50,331 --> 01:25:51,730
- Oh, Eg.
- Ha, ha!

1152
01:25:53,234 --> 01:25:55,099
FEMALE OWL:
Are there any casualties?

1153
01:25:55,270 --> 01:25:58,000
- We're so proud of you.
- Ha, ha!

1154
01:25:58,173 --> 01:26:01,165
- Da, the stories...
- Ha, ha.

1155
01:26:01,342 --> 01:26:02,775
...they're real.

1156
01:26:03,244 --> 01:26:05,678
You made them real, Soren.

1157
01:26:12,554 --> 01:26:14,454
<i>With the peace restored...</i>

1158
01:26:14,656 --> 01:26:16,783
<i>...it was a time for celebration...</i>

1159
01:26:16,958 --> 01:26:20,519
<i>...and recognition
that our small band of owls...</i>

1160
01:26:20,695 --> 01:26:23,858
<i>...who fate and a storm had blown
into the Tree...</i>

1161
01:26:24,032 --> 01:26:29,368
<i>...now stood before its king and queen
as young Guardians.</i>

1162
01:26:47,188 --> 01:26:49,952
<i>Ready finally, with all their hearts...</i>

1163
01:26:50,124 --> 01:26:52,490
<i>...to take that ancient oath:</i>

1164
01:26:53,194 --> 01:26:55,822
<i>To mend those who are broken...</i>

1165
01:26:55,997 --> 01:26:58,227
<i>...to make strong the weak...</i>

1166
01:26:58,399 --> 01:27:00,390
<i>...and, without hesitation...</i>

1167
01:27:00,568 --> 01:27:03,059
<i>...vanquish the evil.</i>

1168
01:27:03,938 --> 01:27:05,428
<i>For as we know...</i>

1169
01:27:05,607 --> 01:27:07,598
<i>...Nyra escaped.</i>

1170
01:27:08,776 --> 01:27:10,141
<i>And Kludd?</i>

1171
01:27:11,713 --> 01:27:13,806
<i>Well, Kludd was never found.</i>

1172
01:27:15,216 --> 01:27:16,478
Should I stop?

1173
01:27:16,651 --> 01:27:18,949
What? Please, don't stop.

1174
01:27:19,120 --> 01:27:21,088
I don't wanna give anyone daymares.

1175
01:27:21,256 --> 01:27:24,089
Oh, come on.
There must be more, there must be.

1176
01:27:24,259 --> 01:27:26,318
Ha, ha. Listen to them, Soren.

1177
01:27:27,629 --> 01:27:28,994
They want more stories.

1178
01:27:31,499 --> 01:27:34,696
Well, come on, you lot.
Let's not disappoint them.

1179
01:27:35,537 --> 01:27:38,438
Ah. There's a good storm brewing.

1180
01:27:38,606 --> 01:27:42,770
And if we're lucky,
it'll be chock full of baggywrinkles.

1181
01:27:59,127 --> 01:28:00,754
Hmm.
