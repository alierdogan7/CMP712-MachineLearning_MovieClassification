<i>and you die.</i>

4
00:00:10,141 --> 00:00:11,762
<i>There are not do-overs.</i>

5
00:00:11,882 --> 00:00:15,865
<i>No second chances to make things right
if you frakked them up the first time.</i>

6
00:00:16,577 --> 00:00:18,166
<i>Not in this life anyway.</i>

7
00:00:24,501 --> 00:00:26,135
<i>This is the Battlestar Pegasus</i>

8
00:00:26,255 --> 00:00:28,901
<i>to the ship claiming to be
the Galactica. Please respond.</i>

9
00:00:29,299 --> 00:00:30,227
<i>Pegasus?</i>

10
00:00:30,434 --> 00:00:32,907
How could that be?
The entire fleet was destroyed.

11
00:00:33,598 --> 00:00:34,764
<i>Admiral Cain.</i>

12
00:00:35,094 --> 00:00:37,486
<i>We had no idea
there were other survivors.</i>

13
00:00:37,606 --> 00:00:40,845
<i>On behalf of the officers and the crew
of the Pegasus,</i>

14
00:00:40,965 --> 00:00:43,454
welcome back to the colonial fleet.

15
00:00:43,838 --> 00:00:45,907
<i>What they did to you was wrong.</i>

16
00:00:46,449 --> 00:00:47,308
<i>Evil.</i>

17
00:00:47,428 --> 00:00:48,626
What you need...

18
00:00:48,888 --> 00:00:50,019
is justice.

19
00:00:54,378 --> 00:00:55,477
<i>Frak you.</i>

20
00:00:57,123 --> 00:01:00,220
<i>And she died knowing that her ship
and her crew were safe</i>

21
00:01:01,558 --> 00:01:04,230
and that her mission
had been accomplished.

22
00:01:05,362 --> 00:01:08,764
Nothing was more important to her than
her ship, her crew, and her mission.

23
00:01:11,465 --> 00:01:15,360
<i>And as I take command of Pegasus,
I pledge to uphold those values</i>

24
00:01:16,072 --> 00:01:18,219
<i>that made her such an effective</i>

25
00:01:18,363 --> 00:01:19,406
<i>and heroic leader.</i>

26
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:24,022
Word of Fisk's murder has
spread out through the entire fleet.

27
00:01:24,142 --> 00:01:26,193
Crew can fall apart
when their commander is killed.

28
00:01:26,313 --> 00:01:28,579
Pegasus lost two in a matter of weeks.

29
00:01:28,703 --> 00:01:30,730
I'm putting Garner in command.

30
00:01:30,905 --> 00:01:33,340
Commander Garner,
two Baseships just jumped in.

31
00:01:33,706 --> 00:01:35,677
Nukes inbound. We're under attack.

32
00:01:36,111 --> 00:01:39,398
We need those FTLs fixed soon.
Or we're dead.

33
00:01:39,629 --> 00:01:41,095
<i>I need to go down there.</i>

34
00:01:44,014 --> 00:01:44,823
<i>Sir,</i>

35
00:01:44,943 --> 00:01:46,124
<i>we've lost Garner.</i>

36
00:01:49,156 --> 00:01:51,688
<i>He sacrificed himself
to save the Pegasus.</i>

37
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:53,948
<i>Garner was my decision.</i>

38
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:56,672
<i>His failure's my responsibility.</i>

39
00:01:58,127 --> 00:01:59,988
Congratulations, Commander.

40
00:02:00,236 --> 00:02:01,990
The Pegasus is your command.

41
00:02:04,879 --> 00:02:06,241
<i>Like I said,</i>

42
00:02:06,757 --> 00:02:08,191
<i>you make your choices</i>

43
00:02:08,408 --> 00:02:09,963
<i>and you live with them.</i>

44
00:02:10,541 --> 00:02:12,512
<i>And in the end, you are those choices.</i>

You're gonna make me regret
having you along, aren't you?

{\pos(192,230)}I'm with you, thank God.

53
00:03:26,063 --> 00:03:28,624
{\pos(192,230)}Thank you Madam President,
Admiral Adama.

54
00:03:29,733 --> 00:03:32,840
{\pos(192,230)}Eight months ago, the world changed.
Our lives changed forever.

<i>They're more than words.</i>

61
00:03:47,110 --> 00:03:50,453
{\pos(192,230)}Those are the guiding principles
for those who serve in the military.

62
00:03:50,577 --> 00:03:53,936
{\pos(192,210)}And recently all have been
of short supply on this ship.

63
00:03:54,463 --> 00:03:55,964
{\pos(192,210)}That's gonna change,

64
00:03:56,609 --> 00:03:57,815
{\pos(192,210)}beginning today.

65
00:03:58,399 --> 00:04:00,750
We can always choose our circumstances

66
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:03,398
but we can't choose how we handle them.

67
00:04:04,162 --> 00:04:06,406
I intend to give you my all,

68
00:04:06,963 --> 00:04:09,034
I expect nothing less in return.

69
00:04:09,429 --> 00:04:12,059
{\pos(192,210)}I've already appointed Kara Thrace
as my acting CAG,

70
00:04:12,179 --> 00:04:16,009
{\pos(192,210)}I'll be making other officer
and duty assignments in the coming days.

{\pos(192,210)}<i>As I review your...</i>

73
00:05:42,554 --> 00:05:43,616
{\pos(192,210)}Come in.

74
00:05:47,519 --> 00:05:50,421
{\pos(192,210)}Lieutenant Kendra Shaw
reporting as ordered, Sir.

75
00:05:51,125 --> 00:05:52,463
{\pos(192,210)}At ease, Lieutenant.

76
00:05:52,583 --> 00:05:54,640
{\pos(192,210)}- Have a sit.
- No, thank you.

77
00:05:54,852 --> 00:05:56,733
Frankly,
I'm used to standing in this room.

78
00:05:58,891 --> 00:05:59,840
{\pos(192,210)}Yeah.

79
00:06:00,325 --> 00:06:02,322
{\pos(192,210)}Admiral Cain
apparently wasn't big on chairs.

80
00:06:03,657 --> 00:06:05,648
{\pos(192,210)}Even dead, woman casts a shadow.

81
00:06:06,488 --> 00:06:08,456
I'm sure I don't have to tell you that.

82
00:06:08,576 --> 00:06:09,496
Sir?

83
00:06:12,197 --> 00:06:15,630
I've been reviewing the Fitreps
for the ship's officers and...

84
00:06:16,734 --> 00:06:18,230
frankly, you're a puzzle.

85
00:06:19,974 --> 00:06:22,501
Top ratings from Cain,
clearly thought the world of you.

86
00:06:23,584 --> 00:06:26,939
{\pos(192,210)}Then a whole series of increasingly
negative reports from Fisk and Garner

87
00:06:27,059 --> 00:06:29,099
{\pos(192,210)}who demoted you to kitchen duty for...

88
00:06:29,379 --> 00:06:31,670
"persistent insubordinate behaviour".

89
00:06:32,528 --> 00:06:34,938
So, the question is: who are you?

90
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:05,677
<i>Raptor 1-7-9,
you're cleared for docking bay 3.</i>

91
00:07:05,839 --> 00:07:06,995
<i>Call the ball.</i>

92
00:07:07,163 --> 00:07:09,382
Roger that, Pegasus. We have the ball.

93
00:07:31,671 --> 00:07:32,950
Come in!

94
00:07:40,846 --> 00:07:42,889
That's your idea of vacation readings?

95
00:07:43,044 --> 00:07:44,958
What is that? Your idea of a hobby?

96
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:46,636
Yeah, it is.

97
00:07:47,341 --> 00:07:48,187
So,

98
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:51,469
have you figured out
how you're gonna spend your shore leave?

99
00:07:53,034 --> 00:07:55,958
I'm thinking about maybe going home
to Tauron to visit some friends but

100
00:07:56,078 --> 00:07:57,935
I don't have any definite plans yet, no.

101
00:07:58,059 --> 00:08:00,982
On that case, how about
spending some time with us on Gemenon?

102
00:08:01,702 --> 00:08:04,495
I know Erika and the girls
would love to see you.

103
00:08:05,248 --> 00:08:07,621
Come on, Helena. You deserve a break.

104
00:08:07,817 --> 00:08:10,063
You're going full tilt
for over a year now.

105
00:08:10,183 --> 00:08:13,179
I've got a repair list as long as
my arm plus our network's gonna be down

106
00:08:13,299 --> 00:08:15,614
for the retrofit and you know
I don't like leaving Pegasus

107
00:08:15,734 --> 00:08:17,552
at the mercy of civil contractors, so...{\Uncut version: at the mercy of a bunch of civil contractors, so...}

108
00:08:17,672 --> 00:08:19,366
All right, listen to your XO.

109
00:08:19,486 --> 00:08:22,128
Once in a while,
it's OK to get off the treadmill.

110
00:08:25,141 --> 00:08:26,545
I will think about it.

111
00:08:29,370 --> 00:08:31,012
- I'll think about it.
- OK.

112
00:08:54,315 --> 00:08:57,091
Excuse me,
could you please point me towards...

113
00:09:21,338 --> 00:09:23,530
Excuse me, could you please show me...

114
00:09:24,449 --> 00:09:26,316
- Looking for the CIC?
- Yes.

115
00:09:27,203 --> 00:09:28,320
How did you know?

116
00:09:28,482 --> 00:09:31,364
You got that new officer meaning
to report to her CO look down cold.

117
00:09:33,187 --> 00:09:36,287
One of the benefits of
being a network administrator.

118
00:09:36,974 --> 00:09:38,057
This is us.

119
00:09:38,828 --> 00:09:40,819
This is where you need to be.

120
00:09:43,317 --> 00:09:44,995
You're a live savior. Kendra Shaw.

121
00:09:45,256 --> 00:09:47,372
- Gina Inviere.
- Inviere...

122
00:09:47,584 --> 00:09:49,966
That's old Geminates
for "Resurrection", isn't it?

123
00:09:51,546 --> 00:09:54,156
One of the benefits of
being a lapsed classics major.

124
00:09:54,276 --> 00:09:57,039
Guess you never knowing something
like that might coming handy?

125
00:09:57,159 --> 00:09:59,824
- Welcome to Pegasus, Lieutenant.
- Thank you.

126
00:10:18,661 --> 00:10:21,478
Lieutenant Kendra Shaw,
reporting for duty, Sir.

127
00:10:21,818 --> 00:10:24,036
Did you enjoy your coffee, Lieutenant?

128
00:10:24,646 --> 00:10:25,550
My coffee?

129
00:10:25,670 --> 00:10:28,296
Just say yes
so we don't get off from the wrong foot.

130
00:10:29,297 --> 00:10:30,425
Yes, Sir.

131
00:10:31,488 --> 00:10:32,375
Good!

132
00:10:32,795 --> 00:10:36,561
You see, because I figured that
you either got lost on your way to CIC,

133
00:10:36,917 --> 00:10:38,723
or you stopped for a cup of coffee and

134
00:10:38,934 --> 00:10:41,050
frankly, I'd rather think
it was a cup of coffee

135
00:10:41,170 --> 00:10:44,620
than realize my new aid can't
find her way throughout the Battlestar.

136
00:10:44,797 --> 00:10:47,691
- Sir, I've just arrived...
- I'm not finished speaking.

137
00:10:54,045 --> 00:10:55,407
I know why you're here.

138
00:10:56,016 --> 00:10:59,578
You're here because you think this job
is a stepping stone to a better one.{\Uncut version: You're here because you think this job is a stepping stone to a still better one.}

139
00:10:59,889 --> 00:11:02,894
So, let me guess. You had your mother
pull some strings. And she...

140
00:11:03,014 --> 00:11:05,000
My mother's dead, Sir.
She died of cancer.

141
00:11:05,485 --> 00:11:07,157
Yes, I know. I read the papers.

142
00:11:08,236 --> 00:11:10,922
And while I'm very sorry for your loss,

143
00:11:11,179 --> 00:11:15,029
you'd be well advised to make that
the last time you play on my sympathies.{\uncut version: "You'd be well advised to make that the last time you attempt to play on my sympathies."}

144
00:11:16,132 --> 00:11:18,930
Between you and me, I'm feeling
a hell of a lot sorrier for myself.

145
00:11:20,554 --> 00:11:22,100
- Mister Hoshi.
- Sir.

146
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:24,853
Can you please direct this lieutenant

147
00:11:25,015 --> 00:11:26,160
to her quarters?

148
00:11:26,516 --> 00:11:27,981
- Yes, Sir.
- You're dismissed.

149
00:11:31,829 --> 00:11:32,871
Lieutenant.

150
00:11:40,608 --> 00:11:42,594
- A little mid-morning snack.
- Yeah.

151
00:11:43,505 --> 00:11:45,777
- I'm gonna be in my quarters.
- Yes, Sir.

152
00:11:51,374 --> 00:11:53,719
Beauty of a network system is
that with the right passcode

153
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:56,396
you can control just about
any part of the ship from any other.

154
00:11:56,516 --> 00:11:58,504
Of course the system's down
for the retrofit,{\Uncut version: "Of course the system's down right now for the retrofit.}

155
00:11:58,624 --> 00:12:00,818
but in emergency,
it's like cutting unlimited backups.

156
00:12:00,938 --> 00:12:02,635
Assuming no one hits the wrong button.

157
00:12:02,755 --> 00:12:04,091
Yeah, no one can't shit.

158
00:12:04,211 --> 00:12:06,698
That's the fear of the Gods,
unto everyone's baseship...

159
00:13:01,047 --> 00:13:02,793
<i>Are you OK?</i>

160
00:13:10,418 --> 00:13:12,165
Come on, soldier. Get up. On your feet.

161
00:13:13,605 --> 00:13:14,478
Hoshi!

162
00:13:20,862 --> 00:13:22,345
Follow me to CIC. Come on!

163
00:13:38,773 --> 00:13:41,483
- Seal the hatch and block compartments.{\Uncut version: Seal the hatch and block the compartments.}
- What the hell hit us?

164
00:13:41,603 --> 00:13:43,854
Radiological reading
looks like nuclear detonation.

165
00:13:43,974 --> 00:13:46,317
- Multiple hits.
- It's the Cylons. It has to be.

166
00:13:46,437 --> 00:13:49,378
But they've broken the armistice
and sparked an all-out attack.

167
00:13:49,502 --> 00:13:51,054
For all, we still have our power.

168
00:13:51,174 --> 00:13:53,719
But that's about it, dradis is erratic,
weapons are offline,{\Uncut version: Yeah, but that's about it, the dradis is erratic, weapons are offline,}

169
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:56,492
it seems we lost all computers.
We have to do everything manually.

170
00:14:14,402 --> 00:14:15,899
I want all hatches sealed.

171
00:14:16,928 --> 00:14:18,355
Docking connections starboard.

172
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:34,125
Lieutenant, spool up our FTL drive.

173
00:14:34,287 --> 00:14:35,374
Yes, Sir.

174
00:14:36,295 --> 00:14:38,849
We're preparing
for an emergency jump, everyone.

175
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:41,826
Circuit load on F1.
It's so jumpy.

176
00:14:46,575 --> 00:14:48,763
Sir, two more nukes
head straight for us.

177
00:14:48,927 --> 00:14:50,505
Estimate 20 seconds to impact.

178
00:14:50,625 --> 00:14:53,770
FTL spooling, Sir. Without a computer,
we can't calculate that jump.

179
00:14:54,171 --> 00:14:55,939
Don't bother calculating. Just do it.

180
00:14:56,101 --> 00:14:58,575
We're gonna do it blind, Sir.
We might head up inside a star.

181
00:15:02,065 --> 00:15:04,892
- Missile's closing in. Ten seconds.
- It doesn't matter where we jump.

182
00:15:05,012 --> 00:15:06,963
Just frakking do it, Lieutenant!

183
00:15:13,926 --> 00:15:15,206
FTL online.

184
00:15:15,326 --> 00:15:16,389
5 seconds.

185
00:15:16,509 --> 00:15:17,706
Lieutenant, now!

186
00:15:25,841 --> 00:15:26,678
<i>Who am I?</i>

187
00:15:27,511 --> 00:15:30,139
I'm a soldier. As were Fisk and Garner.

188
00:15:30,676 --> 00:15:33,296
Neither those men deserve my respect,
so they didn't get it.

189
00:15:35,404 --> 00:15:36,756
Can you be more specific?

190
00:15:37,282 --> 00:15:38,870
Fisk was a black market seller.

191
00:15:38,990 --> 00:15:41,760
This piece of garbage,
unworthy of the uniform.

192
00:15:42,337 --> 00:15:44,110
Garner was a mud net.

193
00:15:44,275 --> 00:15:47,930
who tried to micro-manage this ship like
it was some porky piece of machinery.

194
00:15:48,402 --> 00:15:50,365
Hard to dispute either assessment.

195
00:15:50,787 --> 00:15:51,971
What about me?

196
00:15:54,083 --> 00:15:56,187
Don't hold back
just because I've got a pulse.

197
00:15:59,529 --> 00:16:00,590
You're a step up.

198
00:16:02,118 --> 00:16:04,393
But that doesn't change the fact
that you're an outsider

199
00:16:04,513 --> 00:16:06,397
who was brought in
to clean up our mess,

200
00:16:07,436 --> 00:16:10,403
or the impression that your daddy
just gave you a Battlestar,

201
00:16:11,013 --> 00:16:13,433
like he was tossing you the keys
to a new car.

202
00:16:17,276 --> 00:16:19,515
You certainly don't disappoint,
Lieutenant.

203
00:16:26,474 --> 00:16:28,849
So, how would you like to be my new XO?

204
00:16:33,396 --> 00:16:34,338
Sir?

205
00:16:34,799 --> 00:16:37,834
One thing I learned from my father,
before he tossed me the keys

206
00:16:37,954 --> 00:16:40,301
is that a commander needs
a strong right arm.

207
00:16:40,629 --> 00:16:43,882
I also need to send a message to
this crew, that I respect Cain's legacy.

208
00:16:44,002 --> 00:16:45,965
Even if the truth is that I don't.

209
00:16:46,467 --> 00:16:47,565
I'm no Cain.

210
00:16:48,490 --> 00:16:51,439
But I intend to give this crew
their pride back.

211
00:16:52,743 --> 00:16:54,776
So, I'll let you carry her torch.

212
00:16:56,794 --> 00:16:57,799
Deal?

213
00:17:04,577 --> 00:17:06,088
In that case, Major,

214
00:17:06,468 --> 00:17:07,858
you ready your uniform.

215
00:17:12,416 --> 00:17:13,308
Dismissed.

216
00:17:38,287 --> 00:17:39,107
10,

217
00:17:39,617 --> 00:17:40,419
9,

218
00:17:41,175 --> 00:17:41,979
8,

219
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:43,592
7,

220
00:17:44,412 --> 00:17:45,217
6,

221
00:17:45,982 --> 00:17:46,786
5,

222
00:17:47,888 --> 00:17:48,692
4,

223
00:17:49,543 --> 00:17:50,347
3,

224
00:17:51,051 --> 00:17:51,855
2,

225
00:17:52,311 --> 00:17:53,903
1, you're done.

226
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:58,945
- You think that weapon's ready to fire?
- Yes, Sir.

227
00:17:59,869 --> 00:18:01,622
You're ready to bet your life on that?

228
00:18:01,742 --> 00:18:03,479
The lives of all your buddies?

229
00:18:03,825 --> 00:18:04,675
Sir...

230
00:18:06,064 --> 00:18:07,116
Yes, Sir.

231
00:18:10,615 --> 00:18:12,004
Then fire your weapon.

232
00:18:13,206 --> 00:18:15,626
Are you deaf, soldier?
I said fire your frakking weapon.

233
00:18:35,195 --> 00:18:36,237
Again.

234
00:18:40,253 --> 00:18:41,456
Didn't think it possible

235
00:18:41,817 --> 00:18:44,315
you could find an XO meaner
than Saul Tigh.

236
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:46,831
Yeah, she's tough.

237
00:18:47,770 --> 00:18:50,803
- But I think we need it tough.
- Any ruffled feathers?

238
00:18:51,403 --> 00:18:54,183
You know,
she and Kara don't exactly get along.

239
00:18:55,933 --> 00:18:58,173
I'd like to sell tickets to that dance.

240
00:19:00,403 --> 00:19:02,976
Juste remember
that an XO is not a blunt instrument.

241
00:19:04,299 --> 00:19:07,558
The two of you have to make up a team.
That takes trust.

242
00:19:08,458 --> 00:19:10,562
Now we trust each others to do our jobs.

243
00:19:11,726 --> 00:19:13,313
I guess that's a start.

244
00:19:16,510 --> 00:19:19,533
Now that your house is in order,
I have a mission for you.

245
00:19:19,969 --> 00:19:21,329
Against my better judgment,

246
00:19:22,223 --> 00:19:25,218
I let a science team
take a Raptor from us.

247
00:19:25,998 --> 00:19:28,693
Go out to study a supernova remnant.

248
00:19:29,458 --> 00:19:30,622
They're overdue.

249
00:19:31,587 --> 00:19:34,151
I want you to track the course.
See what you turn up.

250
00:19:34,813 --> 00:19:37,090
There are three civilians, two pilots.

251
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:38,968
And if we run into the Cylons?

252
00:19:41,024 --> 00:19:43,188
It's a search and rescue mission.

253
00:19:44,221 --> 00:19:47,076
Don't get into a battle
that you don't wanna play.

254
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:48,648
That beeing said,

255
00:19:49,399 --> 00:19:50,742
use your own judgment.

256
00:19:52,098 --> 00:19:53,676
This is your command.

257
00:20:07,392 --> 00:20:09,861
<i>Nothing to the right of me,
nothing to the left of me.</i>

258
00:20:10,448 --> 00:20:12,203
Feel like
I'm drowning in nothing out here.

259
00:20:12,668 --> 00:20:15,588
<i>Come on, Showboat, sing out.
Let me know I got company.</i>

260
00:20:17,330 --> 00:20:19,921
<i>Sing out, Kat? You mean, like a song?</i>

261
00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:23,198
<i>What about
"Ninety nine bottles of Ambrosia"?</i>

262
00:20:23,569 --> 00:20:24,837
<i>Damn, Showboat.</i>

263
00:20:25,015 --> 00:20:26,724
<i>You're taking me back.</i>

264
00:20:26,851 --> 00:20:27,856
<i>Road trip.</i>

265
00:20:38,076 --> 00:20:39,024
Thank you.

266
00:20:42,071 --> 00:20:44,028
{\pos(192,230)}- Pass me the circuit board.
- Here you go.

267
00:20:50,485 --> 00:20:52,823
The sickbay just lost another two.

268
00:20:54,264 --> 00:20:57,034
- That raises our casualties to what?
- 723.

269
00:20:58,644 --> 00:21:00,485
It's more than a quarter of our crew.

270
00:21:02,415 --> 00:21:03,704
What's our fighter status?

271
00:21:04,192 --> 00:21:05,835
Twelve Vipers destroyed.

272
00:21:05,985 --> 00:21:07,506
One of two Raptors.

273
00:21:08,032 --> 00:21:10,990
Another seventeen ships
too badly damaged to be repaired.

274
00:21:13,163 --> 00:21:14,215
What else?

275
00:21:17,450 --> 00:21:19,537
Sir, we've tried to keep a lid
on what we learned

276
00:21:19,657 --> 00:21:21,174
from com traffic before it stopped.

277
00:21:21,478 --> 00:21:23,018
But rumors keep leaking out.

278
00:21:24,473 --> 00:21:26,952
- We need facts, not supposition.
- I agree.

279
00:21:27,430 --> 00:21:30,397
We're four, maybe five,
plotted jumps back to the colonies.

280
00:21:31,251 --> 00:21:34,068
I don't imagine you wanna risk
the whole ship for a recon run, right?

281
00:21:34,762 --> 00:21:36,839
Send two Raptors,
tell them not to engage

282
00:21:37,001 --> 00:21:39,785
- the enemy. I want information only.
- Yes, Sir.

283
00:21:41,236 --> 00:21:44,550
Ready to reboot nav
and defense computer systems. Stand by.

284
00:21:56,304 --> 00:21:57,384
Lieutenant.

285
00:21:57,901 --> 00:21:58,952
Admiral.

286
00:21:59,719 --> 00:22:02,157
The helms, weapons and FTL computer
are back on line

287
00:22:02,277 --> 00:22:04,754
and I think I know how
the Cylons took down our defence grid.

288
00:22:04,874 --> 00:22:08,151
These lines of code in the new
navigation program were about to upload.

289
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:10,777
They've been designed
to create a backdoor

290
00:22:10,952 --> 00:22:13,475
that could enable an enemy
to wirelessly access the program.

291
00:22:13,595 --> 00:22:17,191
That could introduce a virus that
could affect the entire network, right?{\Uncut version: That could introduce a virus that could affect the entire network, is that what you say?}

292
00:22:17,387 --> 00:22:19,200
Luckily, ours was already down

293
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:23,166
but I suggest that we keep it that way
even after we've purged the program.

294
00:22:25,154 --> 00:22:28,257
All right, Lieutenant, it's your ball.
Run with it.

295
00:22:28,829 --> 00:22:31,285
You're not quite
as useless as I thought.

296
00:22:31,939 --> 00:22:33,660
How long have you been at your station?

297
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:35,856
I don't know, Sir.
I guess I just never left.

298
00:22:37,529 --> 00:22:41,212
You should consider getting rag time.
It's been 2 days since the attack.{\Uncut version: You might want to consider getting some rag time. It's been 2 days since the attack.}

299
00:22:42,997 --> 00:22:43,797
Sir.

300
00:22:46,340 --> 00:22:47,493
Sir, I'm sorry.

301
00:22:49,108 --> 00:22:51,450
I'm sorry about the way
I behaved when the nukes hit.

302
00:22:51,589 --> 00:22:52,922
I was scared.

303
00:22:53,054 --> 00:22:54,550
Actually, I was terrified,

304
00:22:54,672 --> 00:22:55,829
and I froze.

305
00:22:56,641 --> 00:22:58,462
You're not afraid anymore, are you, Lt?

306
00:22:59,620 --> 00:23:01,048
- No, sir.
- Good.

307
00:23:02,152 --> 00:23:05,103
You hold on to that anger
and you keep it close.

308
00:23:05,876 --> 00:23:08,848
It will stop you being afraid the
next time. It'll tell you what to do.{\Uncut version: It will stop you being afraid the next time. It'll tell you what you have to do.}

309
00:23:11,243 --> 00:23:12,643
Lieutenant, button up.

310
00:24:22,709 --> 00:24:24,298
This is your Admiral.

311
00:24:28,754 --> 00:24:31,684
I know there have been
a lot of rumors going around

312
00:24:32,552 --> 00:24:36,261
about the destruction that's been
visited on our homeworlds by the Cylons.

313
00:24:38,768 --> 00:24:42,653
<i>I would like to tell you that
they're exaggeration but in fact,</i>

314
00:24:44,747 --> 00:24:46,573
<i>they don't even come close to convey</i>

315
00:24:46,693 --> 00:24:49,067
<i>the horror
that's just been unleashed among us.</i>

316
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:51,996
The facts are...

317
00:24:54,324 --> 00:24:56,483
that our colonies have been destroyed,

318
00:24:57,746 --> 00:24:59,638
our cities have been nuked,

319
00:25:01,037 --> 00:25:02,746
and our fleet's gone too.

320
00:25:05,608 --> 00:25:08,753
<i>So far, there are no indications
of any other survivors.</i>

321
00:25:12,378 --> 00:25:15,716
<i>I imagine you're all asking yourselves
the same question I am.</i>

322
00:25:19,313 --> 00:25:20,712
What do we do, now?

323
00:25:22,674 --> 00:25:23,832
Do we run?

324
00:25:26,359 --> 00:25:27,566
Do we hide?

325
00:25:31,736 --> 00:25:33,923
I think those are the easy choices.

326
00:25:38,501 --> 00:25:40,557
A philosopher once said:

327
00:25:41,198 --> 00:25:44,962
"When face with untenable alternatives,
you should consider your imperative."

328
00:25:48,990 --> 00:25:50,310
Look around you.

329
00:25:53,688 --> 00:25:55,866
Our imperative is right here.

330
00:25:57,763 --> 00:26:01,879
In our bulkheads,
in our planes, in our guns,

331
00:26:03,554 --> 00:26:05,122
and in ourselves.

332
00:26:06,296 --> 00:26:08,218
War is our imperative.

333
00:26:10,121 --> 00:26:12,531
And if right now,
victory seems like an impossibility,

334
00:26:12,651 --> 00:26:15,194
then there is something else
to reach for.

335
00:26:16,479 --> 00:26:17,500
Revenge.

336
00:26:20,366 --> 00:26:21,446
Payback.

337
00:26:24,727 --> 00:26:26,691
And so, we will fight.

338
00:26:27,535 --> 00:26:31,192
Because in the end, it's the only
alternative our enemies have left us.

339
00:26:33,759 --> 00:26:36,222
<i>I say let's make these murdering things</i>

340
00:26:36,385 --> 00:26:39,517
understand that as long
as this crew and this ship survive

341
00:26:39,764 --> 00:26:43,447
that this war that they started
will not be over.

342
00:26:47,458 --> 00:26:48,526
Thank you.

343
00:26:54,302 --> 00:26:55,544
So say we all.

344
00:26:56,641 --> 00:26:57,695
So say we all.

345
00:26:58,444 --> 00:26:59,966
So say we all!

346
00:27:39,762 --> 00:27:42,979
Com relay that it looks more like
some kind of frakked up can opener.

347
00:27:43,099 --> 00:27:45,635
From what we can tell,
it's guarded by a half thousand Raiders.

348
00:27:45,769 --> 00:27:48,664
- So?
- They don't expect anyone to attack it.

349
00:27:48,953 --> 00:27:51,542
Gentlemen,
you're looking at our first target.

350
00:27:51,835 --> 00:27:53,796
Nice work finding it, Lieutenant.

351
00:27:55,121 --> 00:27:56,462
Thanks, I had help.

352
00:27:58,150 --> 00:27:59,491
Speak of the devil.

353
00:28:00,067 --> 00:28:02,611
- Hello, Gina, welcome.
- Hello.

354
00:28:05,095 --> 00:28:07,960
Gentlemen,
I'd like you to meet Miss Gina Inviere.

355
00:28:08,084 --> 00:28:10,973
Miss Inviere and Lieutenant Shaw
are working very closely

356
00:28:11,107 --> 00:28:14,778
upgrading our systems and before that,
she was supervising our retrofit

357
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:17,795
and I must say she's proven herself
invaluable in both capacities.

358
00:28:17,915 --> 00:28:18,704
Thank you.

359
00:28:19,066 --> 00:28:20,829
You certainly set a beautiful table.

360
00:28:21,235 --> 00:28:22,181
Thank you.

361
00:28:22,557 --> 00:28:24,826
Everyone, please have a seat. Please...

362
00:28:25,987 --> 00:28:28,323
I think it's quite important
for our ship's officers

363
00:28:28,443 --> 00:28:30,336
to get together every once in a while.

364
00:28:30,627 --> 00:28:33,256
Share some food, some wine,
some good conversation.

365
00:28:33,431 --> 00:28:34,394
Ups moral.

366
00:28:34,514 --> 00:28:38,146
Not to mention it's the only time
we get to park our butts on a chair.

367
00:28:38,584 --> 00:28:41,340
Now that you're all here,
I would like to take a moment

368
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:43,098
to say a few words.

369
00:28:47,155 --> 00:28:48,871
In all seriousness,

370
00:28:49,558 --> 00:28:52,930
I said some things before,
in the heat of emotion.

371
00:28:54,239 --> 00:28:56,860
Things that
I thought this crew needed to hear.

372
00:28:58,043 --> 00:29:00,518
But I don't want any of you
for one moment

373
00:29:00,673 --> 00:29:03,849
to think that I would
ever risk lives or resources

374
00:29:04,387 --> 00:29:06,623
in some mad quest for revenge.

375
00:29:10,601 --> 00:29:11,638
My plan

376
00:29:13,271 --> 00:29:16,629
is to wage an all-out
classic guerilla war campaign.

377
00:29:16,749 --> 00:29:20,101
I want to find their weak links
and I want to hit them hard.

378
00:29:20,449 --> 00:29:23,599
As they say,
the best defense is a good offense.

379
00:29:25,866 --> 00:29:27,908
Well, then here's to a good offense

380
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:30,230
and to kicking some cylon ass!

381
00:29:50,032 --> 00:29:51,417
Almost done here.

382
00:29:51,578 --> 00:29:55,462
I don't know how we could firewall these
systems by tomorrow unless we split up.{\Uncut version: I don't know how we're going to firewall these systems by tomorrow unless we split up.}

383
00:29:56,867 --> 00:29:59,446
And you're the only one
with the access codes.

384
00:29:59,859 --> 00:30:03,263
You can speak to the Admiral
about raising your security clearance.

385
00:30:06,292 --> 00:30:08,960
Yeah, I thought
we were being so discrete.

386
00:30:09,847 --> 00:30:12,686
Guess that's hard
when you truly care for someone.

387
00:30:13,583 --> 00:30:14,980
Program's uploaded.

388
00:30:15,104 --> 00:30:17,069
I will need to input your code.

389
00:30:20,623 --> 00:30:22,622
Alpha one niner six gamma one.

390
00:30:25,579 --> 00:30:27,286
To satisfy your curiosity,

391
00:30:28,199 --> 00:30:31,687
we met a few months ago when
I presented the plans for the retrofit.

392
00:30:32,605 --> 00:30:34,596
We spent a lot of time together

393
00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:37,421
working on the details
and I guess one thing led to the other.

394
00:30:39,672 --> 00:30:41,133
You seem so surprised.

395
00:30:42,331 --> 00:30:44,595
It's just that
Cain seems so self-sufficient.

396
00:30:44,941 --> 00:30:47,521
She has needs, just like the rest of us.

397
00:30:47,989 --> 00:30:49,768
No one can survive entirely on her own.

398
00:30:50,738 --> 00:30:53,979
Trust me, Lieutenant.
In the end, we're all just human.

399
00:31:00,932 --> 00:31:03,155
<i>What about "99 bottles of Ambrosia".</i>

400
00:31:04,656 --> 00:31:08,202
{\pos(192,220)}- <i>Damn, Showboat. You're taking me back.</i>
- She ever shut up?

401
00:31:08,555 --> 00:31:12,088
Chatter like that breeds sloppiness,
it's a bad example to the other pilots.{\Uncut version: Chatter like that breeds slopiness, she's gonna set a bad example to the other pilots.}

402
00:31:12,208 --> 00:31:16,211
As long as she sets a good example
with her flying, we'll come out ahead.

403
00:31:16,343 --> 00:31:17,180
Sir?

404
00:31:17,457 --> 00:31:21,512
Multiple dradis contacts
bearing 3-9-9, carom 6-2-0.

405
00:31:21,724 --> 00:31:23,096
Fighter size...

406
00:31:23,688 --> 00:31:26,595
- unknown configuration, Sir.
- Raiders, it has to be.

407
00:31:26,990 --> 00:31:28,253
We got company.

408
00:31:28,373 --> 00:31:30,724
Pegasus, Starbuck.
Where do these guys come from?

409
00:31:31,513 --> 00:31:32,835
Starbuck, actual.

410
00:31:32,955 --> 00:31:34,978
You and Showboat
double time back to the nest.

411
00:31:35,140 --> 00:31:37,189
<i>On our way, Pegasus,
I don't like these odds.</i>

412
00:31:37,701 --> 00:31:39,066
<i>Showboat, stay with me.</i>

413
00:31:39,228 --> 00:31:42,742
Defensive batteries, selective fire
only, watch out for our people.

414
00:31:43,289 --> 00:31:45,559
Prep a jump
as soon as we recover our birds.

415
00:31:45,692 --> 00:31:46,771
Aye, sir.

416
00:31:55,765 --> 00:31:57,113
These ships...

417
00:31:57,319 --> 00:32:00,363
I can almost see 'em.
There's something weird about them.

418
00:32:05,071 --> 00:32:07,970
Sir, shouldn't we launch alert Vipers
and engage?

419
00:32:08,545 --> 00:32:10,330
That's not why we are here, Major.

420
00:32:10,464 --> 00:32:11,515
Sir, wh...

421
00:32:14,704 --> 00:32:16,964
We spot our missing ship,
we'll go after her.

422
00:32:17,084 --> 00:32:20,190
Otherwise, we jump out of here,
we report back to Galactica.

423
00:32:20,668 --> 00:32:23,852
Pegasus, Starbuck. We got a kind
of a problem with our new friends.

424
00:32:23,972 --> 00:32:25,654
They don't want to say goodbye.

425
00:32:25,836 --> 00:32:26,643
Sir,

426
00:32:26,763 --> 00:32:30,055
FTL crew reports power failure
in main navigation computer.

427
00:32:30,175 --> 00:32:32,113
You got to be kidding me.

428
00:32:33,274 --> 00:32:36,290
Let's go on emergency backup.
We need those jump coordinates.

429
00:32:39,288 --> 00:32:42,125
They're all over us.
We can't break free.

430
00:32:44,236 --> 00:32:47,467
Ensign, direct all batteries to commit
full load of fire, close range.

431
00:32:50,538 --> 00:32:51,722
Now, Ensign.

432
00:32:57,243 --> 00:33:00,156
- What the frak?
- We're inside their firing solution.

433
00:33:00,287 --> 00:33:01,732
<i>You're frakking kidding!</i>

434
00:33:01,894 --> 00:33:04,497
Open up with all you got.
We're gonna shoot ourselves the hole.{\Uncut version: Alright, open up with all you got. We're gonna shoot ourselves the hole.}

435
00:33:04,617 --> 00:33:05,820
<i>Is that gonna work?</i>

436
00:33:05,940 --> 00:33:07,959
No, but it'll make you feel better.

437
00:33:17,797 --> 00:33:18,811
Frak!

438
00:33:33,157 --> 00:33:34,481
Son of a bitch.

439
00:33:40,650 --> 00:33:43,106
For frak sakes, it's like
she was trying to get us killed.

440
00:33:43,409 --> 00:33:46,617
Look, Major Shaw has the authority
to take any action she feels necessary

441
00:33:46,737 --> 00:33:49,154
- to protect this ship.
- She's a loose cannon.

442
00:33:49,399 --> 00:33:51,108
And she's also the XO.

443
00:33:51,502 --> 00:33:54,284
And frankly, ordering that barrage
probably saved your skin.

444
00:33:55,046 --> 00:33:56,896
Forgive me, if I don't say "thanks".

445
00:33:57,074 --> 00:33:59,112
- Come on, Kara! Just...
- Don't!

446
00:34:02,852 --> 00:34:05,073
You wanna tell me
what the hell you were thinking?

447
00:34:06,050 --> 00:34:08,505
It was a nice bit of flying, Captain.
But I'd think twice{\Uncut version: It was a nice bit of flying out there, Captain. But I'd think twice}

448
00:34:08,625 --> 00:34:11,426
- about questioning my tactical orders.
- Tactical orders?

449
00:34:11,811 --> 00:34:14,309
That's what you call
blowing a crap at your own pilot.

450
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:18,218
Questioning orders
is a bad idea on this ship,

451
00:34:18,387 --> 00:34:19,459
Captain!

452
00:34:23,711 --> 00:34:26,387
{\pos(192,220)}- How many raiders, Lt?
- Reading twelve signatures, Sir.

453
00:34:26,566 --> 00:34:28,256
It's fewer than we anticipated.

454
00:34:28,932 --> 00:34:31,974
One squadron should be able
to handle them and destroy the target.

455
00:34:33,139 --> 00:34:34,664
Launch Blue squadron.

456
00:34:42,077 --> 00:34:44,860
- New contacts.
- What the hell?

457
00:34:45,038 --> 00:34:46,863
There's a lot of jamming
going on out there.

458
00:34:46,983 --> 00:34:49,047
But I'm reading
15 full squadrons of raiders, Sir.

459
00:34:49,217 --> 00:34:52,033
They must have jumped in
right after we launched our fighters.

460
00:34:52,982 --> 00:34:55,659
This isn't a com relay.
This is a staging ground.

461
00:34:55,779 --> 00:34:57,338
We call our vipers, Sir?

462
00:35:04,091 --> 00:35:05,730
Two minutes to contact.

463
00:35:06,284 --> 00:35:08,100
Admiral, the Cylons knew we were coming.

464
00:35:08,279 --> 00:35:11,119
We have to recover the Vipers
and jump out of here while we still can.

465
00:35:11,241 --> 00:35:12,218
No.

466
00:35:12,546 --> 00:35:14,142
Scramble the reserves.

467
00:35:14,321 --> 00:35:16,659
Order them to provide cover
while Blue attacks the target.

468
00:35:16,969 --> 00:35:18,471
They'll be outnumbered four to one.

469
00:35:18,655 --> 00:35:20,996
A squadron of Raiders has broken off.
They're now inbound.{\Uncut version: A squadron of raiders has broken off and they're now inbound.}

470
00:35:21,340 --> 00:35:23,340
Activate defensive batteries.

471
00:35:23,997 --> 00:35:25,166
They're not responding.{\Uncut version: They're not responding, Sir.}

472
00:35:25,448 --> 00:35:27,430
The networks lock us out
of our weapons grid.

473
00:35:27,550 --> 00:35:29,839
Then have gun crews
assume manual control.

474
00:35:29,959 --> 00:35:30,813
Admiral.

475
00:35:30,984 --> 00:35:34,312
We are hugely outnumbered. And now,
our own weapon's grid won't respond.

476
00:35:34,432 --> 00:35:36,532
What more proof do we need
that this is a trap?

477
00:35:36,652 --> 00:35:38,784
Or more reason
to launch everything we've got.

478
00:35:46,769 --> 00:35:48,929
This is exactly
what you said we wouldn't do.

479
00:35:49,642 --> 00:35:50,954
Even if we succeed,

480
00:35:51,074 --> 00:35:54,041
is this really worth the lives
the plan would cost?

481
00:35:54,745 --> 00:35:57,115
Mister Belzen, are you refusing
to carry out my orders?

482
00:36:02,738 --> 00:36:04,953
Sir,
I cannot in good conscience obey them.

483
00:36:08,651 --> 00:36:10,159
Mr Belzen, give me your side arm.

484
00:36:11,759 --> 00:36:14,454
- Sir?
- I said: "Give me your side arm."

485
00:36:15,932 --> 00:36:16,843
Now!

486
00:36:34,932 --> 00:36:36,031
Gods!

487
00:36:40,648 --> 00:36:41,660
Colonel Fisk!

488
00:36:50,393 --> 00:36:52,196
You're now my XO.

489
00:36:54,289 --> 00:36:57,087
My order still stands.
Would you execute it?

490
00:37:02,094 --> 00:37:03,531
This is the XO.

491
00:37:05,042 --> 00:37:06,836
Launch all remaining squadrons.

492
00:37:26,415 --> 00:37:29,458
Sir, the controls on port side airlock
4, 10 and 12 gone active.

493
00:37:29,578 --> 00:37:31,438
We're being boarded by the Cylons.

494
00:37:31,733 --> 00:37:32,738
Colonel,

495
00:37:33,113 --> 00:37:34,972
Fire up the fast response teams.

496
00:37:35,647 --> 00:37:38,790
<i>- All hands, report to orders...
- Lt, get to secondary damage control.</i>

497
00:37:38,910 --> 00:37:42,073
They will try and vent our air and close
before we have chance to fight back.

498
00:37:42,193 --> 00:37:43,097
Yes, Sir.

499
00:38:09,448 --> 00:38:10,471
Go!

500
00:38:19,764 --> 00:38:21,957
They're coming this way,
killing everyone.

501
00:38:22,172 --> 00:38:23,600
Go to CIC. You'd be safe.

502
00:38:51,818 --> 00:38:53,057
What the frak?

503
00:39:18,269 --> 00:39:20,628
You! Step away from the Admiral.

504
00:39:20,748 --> 00:39:23,605
- Lieutenant?
- I said: "Step away from the Admiral."

505
00:39:23,725 --> 00:39:24,654
Now!

506
00:39:25,494 --> 00:39:26,920
You two. Take her into custody.

507
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:28,785
Belay that.
Lt, what the hell is going on?

508
00:39:28,948 --> 00:39:30,748
She was helping us
with our weapons grid.{\Uncut version: She was just helping us get control of our weapons grid.}

509
00:39:30,868 --> 00:39:33,703
No she wasn't, Sir.
She's a cylon spy that looks like us.

510
00:39:33,873 --> 00:39:35,542
Oh, for Gods sake!

511
00:39:37,792 --> 00:39:39,045
Mister Hoshi,

512
00:39:39,207 --> 00:39:41,923
can you please show us
the security feed from airlock 4.

513
00:39:42,361 --> 00:39:44,529
This is crazy.
I don't know what she thought she saw.

514
00:39:51,954 --> 00:39:53,034
My Gods!

515
00:39:55,461 --> 00:39:57,605
- Get that thing off my bridge.
- Yes, Sir.

516
00:40:15,925 --> 00:40:18,190
Act like officers, Gods damn it!

517
00:40:18,310 --> 00:40:20,497
You've got everybody
watching you on this deck.

518
00:40:34,762 --> 00:40:36,935
Where the hell did they come from?

519
00:40:44,938 --> 00:40:48,741
It's been a long time since
I seen one of these outside a museum.

520
00:40:51,421 --> 00:40:53,417
And you say the entire fleet jumped in?

521
00:40:54,341 --> 00:40:55,581
They came out of nowhere.

522
00:40:58,754 --> 00:41:00,275
Why would the Cylons resurrect

523
00:41:00,455 --> 00:41:04,340
a machine that by their standards
is hopelessly obsolete?

524
00:41:05,006 --> 00:41:07,039
Maybe they didn't resurrect it.

525
00:41:09,527 --> 00:41:11,503
Maybe they're out here all along.

526
00:41:12,611 --> 00:41:14,705
Is there something you wanna tell us?

527
00:41:15,156 --> 00:41:17,245
There are references in our databases,

528
00:41:17,552 --> 00:41:20,097
to a force of centurions,
called Guardians.

529
00:41:20,768 --> 00:41:23,287
Early models like this,
that somehow escaped being scrapped.

530
00:41:23,407 --> 00:41:24,984
What do this Guardians guard?

531
00:41:25,254 --> 00:41:26,456
A hybrid.

532
00:41:26,803 --> 00:41:29,639
An entity that represents the first step
in our evolution

533
00:41:29,827 --> 00:41:32,343
from pure machines to organic beings.

534
00:41:33,245 --> 00:41:34,093
From them,

535
00:41:34,215 --> 00:41:35,172
to us.

536
00:41:35,594 --> 00:41:37,242
A cylon missing link.

537
00:41:37,955 --> 00:41:40,443
No, more like an evolutionary dead end.

538
00:41:40,828 --> 00:41:43,124
There were other hybrids
created to control our baseships

539
00:41:43,244 --> 00:41:45,540
before the experiment was abandoned,
but...

540
00:41:46,167 --> 00:41:47,406
this one was the first.

541
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:48,739
And...

542
00:41:48,859 --> 00:41:50,837
some think it's still alive.

543
00:41:52,029 --> 00:41:53,550
Protected by these Guardians.

544
00:41:55,305 --> 00:41:58,460
And that it's still somehow seeking
its own way to evolve.

545
00:42:00,403 --> 00:42:02,366
The last operation of the war,

546
00:42:03,337 --> 00:42:05,966
Galactica was part of a task force

547
00:42:06,576 --> 00:42:08,923
that destroyed a cylon base.

548
00:42:09,326 --> 00:42:11,195
I was on that mission.

549
00:42:11,330 --> 00:42:14,222
The Cylons was supposedly building

550
00:42:14,410 --> 00:42:15,612
a superweapon.

551
00:43:54,989 --> 00:43:57,628
<i>All this has happened before.</i>

552
00:43:57,928 --> 00:44:00,548
<i>And will happen again.</i>

553
00:44:31,325 --> 00:44:32,811
Is someone in there?

554
00:44:34,514 --> 00:44:35,472
Help.

555
00:44:36,123 --> 00:44:38,205
Help us, they left us here.

556
00:44:38,923 --> 00:44:40,263
Don't leave us here, please.

557
00:44:41,049 --> 00:44:42,638
I'm gonna get you out of here.

558
00:44:44,413 --> 00:44:45,705
We're civilians.

559
00:44:47,166 --> 00:44:49,747
We're traders, from Gemenon. We...

560
00:44:50,528 --> 00:44:53,985
They jumped our convoy. They destroyed
our escort. They took us all prisoners.

561
00:44:55,203 --> 00:44:58,198
There were 50 of us but they've been
taking us away, one by one.

562
00:45:00,013 --> 00:45:01,784
We could hear the others screaming.

563
00:45:02,547 --> 00:45:06,456
We didn't know what happened to them.
Please you gotta get us all out of here.

564
00:45:07,654 --> 00:45:08,706
I'm trying.

565
00:45:09,305 --> 00:45:11,115
The door must be welded shut.

566
00:45:14,420 --> 00:45:16,661
- What the hell is happening?
- I don't know.

567
00:45:17,010 --> 00:45:18,526
Looks like a quake.

568
00:45:18,680 --> 00:45:20,553
The place is starting to come apart.

569
00:45:29,803 --> 00:45:30,907
I got it!

570
00:45:35,170 --> 00:45:36,307
Still stuck.

571
00:45:36,427 --> 00:45:38,106
I can't open it any wider.

572
00:45:44,631 --> 00:45:47,207
You gotta go. You gotta go get help.

573
00:45:47,458 --> 00:45:49,141
I stay here. I stay here with you.

574
00:45:49,261 --> 00:45:51,369
No, you can't do it by yourself.
Just go!

575
00:45:51,489 --> 00:45:52,814
Tell what happened to us.

576
00:45:52,934 --> 00:45:54,492
Our ship was the Diana.

577
00:45:55,466 --> 00:45:57,268
From Gemenon, all right? Just tell them.

578
00:45:57,388 --> 00:45:59,858
If you stay here,
you'll be trapped like us.

579
00:45:59,978 --> 00:46:00,989
Go!

580
00:46:08,284 --> 00:46:10,681
Go! Save yourself.

581
00:46:11,844 --> 00:46:12,948
Go!

582
00:46:38,196 --> 00:46:39,692
Galactica, Husker.

583
00:46:41,147 --> 00:46:43,606
Galactica, this is Husker. Do you copy?

584
00:46:44,126 --> 00:46:46,223
<i>Husker, roger that. Report status.</i>

585
00:46:46,519 --> 00:46:48,284
I crashed on the surface.

586
00:46:48,521 --> 00:46:50,781
They were making something down here.

587
00:46:50,905 --> 00:46:53,064
Experimenting on people to do it.

588
00:46:53,464 --> 00:46:56,211
And now they're getting away
with whatever they've built.

589
00:46:56,510 --> 00:46:58,432
<i>Husker, the war is over!</i>

590
00:47:00,539 --> 00:47:01,542
What?

591
00:47:02,324 --> 00:47:03,687
Galactica repeat!

592
00:47:03,807 --> 00:47:05,211
<i>The war is over.</i>

593
00:47:05,332 --> 00:47:07,381
<i>An armistice was just signed.</i>

594
00:47:07,501 --> 00:47:10,603
<i>Activate your beacon,
we'll send you the SAR bird.</i>

595
00:47:10,847 --> 00:47:12,039
<i>Husker, respond.</i>

596
00:47:13,165 --> 00:47:14,625
<i>They escaped with it.</i>

597
00:47:15,913 --> 00:47:18,005
Right before they signed the armistice.

598
00:47:19,253 --> 00:47:21,538
If this hybrid still exists,

599
00:47:21,853 --> 00:47:24,256
then it's captured some of our people.

600
00:47:24,588 --> 00:47:26,582
I don't want to think about it.

601
00:47:32,906 --> 00:47:34,887
Baltar and Tyrol were able to

602
00:47:35,037 --> 00:47:37,780
pull the Raider's computer
and download the ship's navigation.

603
00:47:37,900 --> 00:47:39,160
Then extrapolate

604
00:47:39,955 --> 00:47:43,529
the possible location for a base.
It's more likely a baseship.

605
00:47:43,861 --> 00:47:45,915
That's where you'll find
our Raptor crew.

606
00:47:46,035 --> 00:47:48,628
It's two, maybe three jumps
from where you were attacked.

607
00:47:48,777 --> 00:47:52,769
I was just telling the commander that we
can't afford to commit both battlestars.

608
00:47:53,007 --> 00:47:56,589
That's just why I'm temporarily
transfering my flag to Pegasus.

609
00:47:57,697 --> 00:48:00,397
- You're going along?
- You're still in command.

610
00:48:00,783 --> 00:48:03,466
Let's just say
I have a personal stake in this mission.

611
00:48:06,571 --> 00:48:08,724
A mission based on a cylon legend.

612
00:48:08,879 --> 00:48:10,516
It's not a legend, son.

613
00:48:12,368 --> 00:48:14,393
I was in the place
where they made that thing.

614
00:48:16,263 --> 00:48:18,314
I saw what they did to make it.

615
00:48:19,521 --> 00:48:21,819
We're not gonna let this happen again.

616
00:48:22,654 --> 00:48:24,278
Not to our own people.

617
00:48:30,043 --> 00:48:32,148
I'll have my XO
start preparing an attack plan.

618
00:48:33,419 --> 00:48:36,030
I'm afraid that brings us
to another matter.

619
00:48:36,152 --> 00:48:37,227
Commander.

620
00:48:43,093 --> 00:48:44,937
Misdirection is the key.

621
00:48:45,258 --> 00:48:47,510
Pegasus jumps
right into the hornet's nest.

622
00:48:47,672 --> 00:48:49,268
They swarm us with their Raiders.

623
00:48:49,389 --> 00:48:51,892
We let them think
they've taken out our FTL

624
00:48:52,422 --> 00:48:56,060
before moving off at sublight speed,
drawing them away.

625
00:48:56,390 --> 00:48:58,663
That's when my strike team jumps in.

626
00:49:03,552 --> 00:49:06,028
It's a hell of a risky plan,
but I guess you know that.

627
00:49:06,298 --> 00:49:08,046
Just remember it's search and rescue.

628
00:49:08,166 --> 00:49:11,534
Get aboard, find our people, set
your nuke, then get back in one peace.

629
00:49:12,017 --> 00:49:14,620
- Who's piloting the Raptor?
- Captain Thrace.

630
00:49:16,077 --> 00:49:17,886
No other pilot
I can trust to pull this off.

631
00:49:19,763 --> 00:49:22,503
Well, I guess the question is
whether I can trust you.

632
00:49:23,091 --> 00:49:25,114
The President believes
that under admiral Cain

633
00:49:25,247 --> 00:49:28,171
you were involved in an incident
aboard a civilian transport,

634
00:49:28,291 --> 00:49:29,484
called Scylla.

635
00:49:30,027 --> 00:49:33,055
An incident in which ten people
were executed. It is true?

636
00:49:46,371 --> 00:49:47,653
<i>I said, is it true?</i>

637
00:49:48,259 --> 00:49:49,347
I was there.

638
00:49:49,479 --> 00:49:51,143
Guessing that's enough to indict me.

639
00:49:54,041 --> 00:49:55,411
Why didn't you tell me?

640
00:49:55,957 --> 00:49:59,069
You said you wanted
to send a message to this ship's crew,

641
00:49:59,250 --> 00:50:01,458
about respecting Cain's legacy.

642
00:50:01,695 --> 00:50:03,325
I am Cain's legacy.

643
00:50:04,269 --> 00:50:06,574
I'm alive
because of the choices she made.

644
00:50:07,304 --> 00:50:09,050
So is everyone else on this ship.

645
00:50:09,680 --> 00:50:11,131
Tell you something else?

646
00:50:11,251 --> 00:50:13,641
Cain wouldn't have blinked twice
at this plan.

647
00:50:13,778 --> 00:50:15,583
She knew that you don't win battles,

648
00:50:15,703 --> 00:50:18,051
never mind morals,
without risking lives.

649
00:50:19,097 --> 00:50:20,436
Are you finished?

650
00:50:21,140 --> 00:50:22,215
Yes, Sir.

651
00:50:22,458 --> 00:50:24,732
If you'd like my resignation,
you can have it.

652
00:50:25,900 --> 00:50:27,777
It'd be easier, wouldn't it?

653
00:50:28,908 --> 00:50:30,807
Then you can go back
to pealing potatoes,

654
00:50:30,927 --> 00:50:32,915
wallowing in self pity,
'cause poor Kendra Shaw

655
00:50:33,037 --> 00:50:36,285
is the only officer in the fleet
who've had to make a hard call.

656
00:50:36,841 --> 00:50:40,196
Well it's not gonna fly, Major.
Not while I'm in command.

657
00:50:40,921 --> 00:50:42,272
The plan's risky,

658
00:50:43,188 --> 00:50:45,753
but right now,
you're the only game in town.

659
00:50:46,318 --> 00:50:48,506
So, complete your mission, Major.

660
00:50:49,287 --> 00:50:50,885
Your plan's approved.

661
00:51:08,080 --> 00:51:09,432
<i>Petrius, this is Adriatic </i>

662
00:51:09,552 --> 00:51:12,244
<i>got another load of salt
wasting in our cargo holes.</i>

663
00:51:12,364 --> 00:51:15,009
<i>Petrius, this is Adriatic.
Another load...</i>

664
00:51:15,229 --> 00:51:16,992
<i>... and we're back with Gaius Baltar.</i>

665
00:51:17,329 --> 00:51:21,213
<i>Doctor, a lot of people once thought
of Pegasus as the answer to our prayer.</i>

666
00:51:21,333 --> 00:51:22,456
<i>Were they wrong?</i>

667
00:51:34,487 --> 00:51:38,448
Final casualty report
lists 816 dead, 121 injured.

668
00:51:38,769 --> 00:51:41,069
32 Vipers destroyed, 61 badly damaged.

669
00:51:41,189 --> 00:51:44,647
The acting chief says we don't have
enough parts to repair them all.

670
00:51:45,059 --> 00:51:48,252
It's a rather high price
for a tactically insignificant victory.

671
00:51:48,628 --> 00:51:51,944
I wouldn't say it's insignificant, Sir.
I'd say we've put the enemy on notice.

672
00:51:53,093 --> 00:51:54,974
The price we paid is my fault.

673
00:51:55,814 --> 00:51:57,241
How do you figure that, Lt?

674
00:51:57,612 --> 00:52:00,202
Well I gave her... <i>it</i> my access codes.

675
00:52:01,055 --> 00:52:03,451
It must have used them
to override our security lockouts.

676
00:52:03,571 --> 00:52:05,916
No, you gave it
something far more important than that.

677
00:52:07,252 --> 00:52:08,818
You gave it your trust,

678
00:52:09,063 --> 00:52:11,380
as did I. But this thing

679
00:52:12,042 --> 00:52:14,991
really knows how to manipulate
human emotions,

680
00:52:15,988 --> 00:52:17,554
preys on them.

681
00:52:22,406 --> 00:52:23,891
Lieutenant Thorne,

682
00:52:27,165 --> 00:52:29,373
I want you to interrogate
our cylon prisoner.

683
00:52:29,493 --> 00:52:31,609
Find out everything it knows.

684
00:52:33,958 --> 00:52:35,709
And since it's so adept

685
00:52:35,829 --> 00:52:37,740
at mimicking human feeling,

686
00:52:38,097 --> 00:52:41,707
I'm assuming that its software
is vulnerable to them as well, so...

687
00:52:43,394 --> 00:52:44,980
Pain, yes, of course.

688
00:52:49,028 --> 00:52:50,167
Degradation,

689
00:52:51,372 --> 00:52:52,257
fear,

690
00:52:53,416 --> 00:52:54,256
shame.

691
00:52:54,748 --> 00:52:57,093
I want you to really test its limits.

692
00:52:59,163 --> 00:53:00,888
Be as creative as you need to be.{\Uncut version: Be as creative a you feel you need to be.}

693
00:53:01,781 --> 00:53:02,788
Yes, Sir.

694
00:53:04,120 --> 00:53:06,795
<i>Lieutenant Thorne. Access granted.</i>

695
00:53:14,959 --> 00:53:17,883
<i>Admiral Cain to CIC.</i>

696
00:53:22,912 --> 00:53:24,651
Lieutenant, come with me.

697
00:53:33,958 --> 00:53:35,216
Colonel, sitrep.

698
00:53:35,336 --> 00:53:39,308
We just detected a fleet of ships
broadcasting colonial IFF signature.

699
00:53:40,274 --> 00:53:41,122
Sir,

700
00:53:42,597 --> 00:53:44,055
they're civilians.

701
00:53:45,393 --> 00:53:46,664
A civilian fleet.

702
00:53:46,828 --> 00:53:48,602
15 ships, Sir.

703
00:53:48,770 --> 00:53:51,109
The CAP has gone ahead to intercept.

704
00:53:57,586 --> 00:54:00,461
Lieutenant, I want you to contact
those ships' captains.

705
00:54:00,593 --> 00:54:02,904
Ask them to forward
their crew and passenger manifest

706
00:54:03,024 --> 00:54:06,495
along with their ships' schematics and
inventory of any weapons or spare parts.

707
00:54:06,779 --> 00:54:07,801
Yes, Sir.

708
00:54:10,176 --> 00:54:12,006
Colonel, I want you to assemble

709
00:54:12,127 --> 00:54:15,769
teams of engineers and marines
and have them board each of those ships.

710
00:54:18,041 --> 00:54:19,633
Sir, are we...

711
00:54:19,795 --> 00:54:21,922
We're gonna take
everything we need from those ships.

712
00:54:22,969 --> 00:54:25,582
And once they'll realize our intent,
it's bound to be resistance.

713
00:54:25,702 --> 00:54:28,017
So we need
to act quickly and decisively.

714
00:54:31,259 --> 00:54:34,726
Colonel, if you have a problem
with any of this, I need to hear it now.

715
00:54:37,625 --> 00:54:38,530
No.

716
00:54:39,150 --> 00:54:40,436
Get to work.

717
00:55:11,765 --> 00:55:13,281
Permission to come aboard?

718
00:55:13,401 --> 00:55:15,392
Permission granted. Welcome.

719
00:55:15,785 --> 00:55:18,734
We prayed for this miracle.
The last time the Cylons found us,

720
00:55:18,961 --> 00:55:21,758
we lost 4 ships but now,
thank the Gods, you've found us.

721
00:55:21,878 --> 00:55:24,971
Mr. Laird, admiral Cain
ordered me to give you this.

722
00:55:28,261 --> 00:55:30,081
- What is it?
- It's a list of materials

723
00:55:30,201 --> 00:55:33,582
and passengers we need transfer
to the Pegasus. Effective immediately.

724
00:55:34,325 --> 00:55:35,921
Your name is on the list.

725
00:55:38,344 --> 00:55:39,369
My name?

726
00:55:40,985 --> 00:55:43,176
Wait. You want to take our FTL drives.

727
00:55:43,754 --> 00:55:45,201
We'll be helpless.

728
00:55:45,733 --> 00:55:48,807
As I said, we're adding
some of your people to our crew.

729
00:55:50,856 --> 00:55:51,664
So...

730
00:55:52,570 --> 00:55:55,248
you're gonna decide just like that
who lives and who dies?

731
00:55:55,368 --> 00:55:58,836
We make whatever accommodations we can,
but, you have to understand.

732
00:55:59,605 --> 00:56:00,807
We're at war.

733
00:56:01,457 --> 00:56:03,467
Military need must take priority.

734
00:56:07,250 --> 00:56:08,617
I don't understand. They're...

735
00:56:09,604 --> 00:56:11,624
they're gonna take what they want

736
00:56:11,762 --> 00:56:13,850
and leave us to fend for ourselves.

737
00:56:15,791 --> 00:56:17,092
I can't do that.

738
00:56:17,705 --> 00:56:19,407
- I can't do it.
- No.

739
00:56:20,194 --> 00:56:21,199
Listen!

740
00:56:21,337 --> 00:56:22,362
All of you!

741
00:56:24,204 --> 00:56:25,484
We have orders

742
00:56:26,154 --> 00:56:29,149
to transfer the crewmen,
and the equipment

743
00:56:29,296 --> 00:56:31,129
on that list, to Pegasus.

744
00:56:32,153 --> 00:56:34,018
We have no wish to harm anyone,

745
00:56:35,266 --> 00:56:37,079
but we will use force if necessary.

746
00:56:38,349 --> 00:56:39,157
No.

747
00:56:42,448 --> 00:56:43,758
You can't do that.

748
00:56:44,132 --> 00:56:45,196
You can't do that.

749
00:56:47,689 --> 00:56:49,616
- Get them back!
- You're here to help us.

750
00:56:51,163 --> 00:56:52,325
You can't do that!

751
00:57:14,512 --> 00:57:16,727
<i>Ship to ship call from colonel Fisk.</i>

752
00:57:16,918 --> 00:57:19,377
<i>What's going on, Colonel?
We're already behind schedule.</i>

753
00:57:19,714 --> 00:57:22,787
Sir, they're denying us access
to the rest of the ship.

754
00:57:22,954 --> 00:57:25,339
We're not dealing with just individuals,
Sir. We have

755
00:57:25,522 --> 00:57:26,579
<i>full families here.</i>

756
00:57:31,821 --> 00:57:35,860
Then tell them you'll shoot the families
of any selectee who doesn't comply.

757
00:57:37,801 --> 00:57:40,620
<i>Sir, did I hear you correctly?</i>

758
00:57:41,388 --> 00:57:44,739
<i>- You don't seriously mean that we...</i>
- Just get it done, Colonel.

759
00:57:49,890 --> 00:57:51,250
Corporal.

760
00:57:52,433 --> 00:57:53,810
Get these people on the deck

761
00:57:53,930 --> 00:57:56,097
- and get them lined up.
- Yes, Sir.

762
00:58:01,517 --> 00:58:02,865
We have orders...

763
00:58:03,929 --> 00:58:05,289
to shoot the families

764
00:58:05,479 --> 00:58:06,835
of any selectee

765
00:58:07,032 --> 00:58:09,278
who refuses to return with us.

766
00:58:09,820 --> 00:58:12,122
We will carry out this order.

767
00:58:12,258 --> 00:58:16,203
Unless, those individuals
are brought forward, now!

768
00:58:16,705 --> 00:58:18,952
- You're here to protect us!
- I repeat.

769
00:58:19,197 --> 00:58:21,750
We will carry out this order!

770
00:58:22,084 --> 00:58:24,044
We will shoot these people.

771
00:58:26,724 --> 00:58:28,271
What are we doing, Sir?

772
00:58:28,823 --> 00:58:29,650
Sir?

773
00:58:41,384 --> 00:58:43,177
Colonel Fisk, to Pegasus.

774
00:58:44,694 --> 00:58:46,606
Colonel Fisk, to Pegasus.

775
00:58:55,453 --> 00:58:56,478
It's over.

776
00:58:58,606 --> 00:59:00,998
The whole fleet has word
of what happened here.

777
00:59:03,306 --> 00:59:05,483
There won't be any more resistance.

778
00:59:58,671 --> 01:00:02,297
<i>Colonial 1 to Raptor 3-5-9,
clear for docking approach.</i>

779
01:00:03,125 --> 01:00:06,671
<i>Colonial 1 to Raptor 3-5-9,
clear for docking approach.</i>

780
01:00:08,691 --> 01:00:11,301
<i>Galactica to Greenleaf shuttle,
you are clear for landing.</i>

781
01:00:11,421 --> 01:00:13,587
<i>Checker's red. Speed to...</i>

782
01:00:32,602 --> 01:00:35,045
So the XO is human after all.

783
01:00:38,119 --> 01:00:39,893
I used to do that myself.

784
01:00:40,444 --> 01:00:42,513
Scrum through the wireless band,

785
01:00:43,340 --> 01:00:45,370
reminds you you're not alone out here.

786
01:00:50,299 --> 01:00:51,540
Got any more?

787
01:00:53,944 --> 01:00:55,186
More of what?

788
01:00:55,934 --> 01:00:57,823
What of you're about
to stick in your neck.

789
01:01:00,259 --> 01:01:01,884
You don't miss much, do you?

790
01:01:06,652 --> 01:01:08,209
Whatever floats your boat, right?

791
01:01:09,647 --> 01:01:12,937
I came down here looking for a loose
bottle, you came down here for...

792
01:01:14,967 --> 01:01:17,420
Guess we both just try
to take the edge off, right?

793
01:01:19,075 --> 01:01:20,159
Guess so.

794
01:01:21,518 --> 01:01:22,622
That's good.

795
01:01:23,085 --> 01:01:25,962
Cause I'd hate to think that Lee's
new XO can't handle the pressure.

796
01:01:26,700 --> 01:01:29,516
Maybe you want to get busted back
to peeling potatoes.

797
01:01:29,636 --> 01:01:32,382
I hate to think that Lee's
favorite pilot wants to find herself

798
01:01:32,502 --> 01:01:35,271
scrubbing floors
for pilfering ships stores.

799
01:01:39,126 --> 01:01:40,998
You keep my secret, Sir?

800
01:01:41,865 --> 01:01:43,126
I'll keep yours.

801
01:02:14,755 --> 01:02:16,694
<i>Unconfirmed reports continue</i>

802
01:02:16,867 --> 01:02:20,398
<i>to attribute President Roslin's
recent miraculous recovery from...</i>

803
01:02:20,518 --> 01:02:22,784
I've seen officers happier
about a promotion.

804
01:02:24,238 --> 01:02:25,641
I am happy, Sir, I am.

805
01:02:26,224 --> 01:02:29,251
I guess I just don't know
what I've done to deserve it.

806
01:02:30,764 --> 01:02:31,932
Don't, Captain.

807
01:02:33,075 --> 01:02:34,669
Don't do it. Don't look back.

808
01:02:38,953 --> 01:02:43,071
Sometimes, we have to leave people
behind, so that we can go on.

809
01:02:45,238 --> 01:02:47,248
So that we can continue to fight.

810
01:02:50,184 --> 01:02:52,411
Sometimes, we have to do things

811
01:02:56,244 --> 01:02:58,235
that we never thought
we were capable of,

812
01:03:01,693 --> 01:03:03,861
if only to show the enemy our will.

813
01:03:05,792 --> 01:03:07,683
Yesterday, you showed me

814
01:03:09,900 --> 01:03:11,574
that you were capable

815
01:03:12,284 --> 01:03:15,791
of setting aside your fear,
setting aside your hesitation,

816
01:03:17,466 --> 01:03:19,200
and even your revulsion

817
01:03:21,229 --> 01:03:23,503
every natural inhibition
that during battle

818
01:03:23,623 --> 01:03:25,672
can mean the difference
between life and death.

819
01:03:40,578 --> 01:03:42,332
When you can be this

820
01:03:45,051 --> 01:03:47,199
for as long as you have to be,

821
01:03:50,587 --> 01:03:52,164
then you're a razor.

822
01:04:07,908 --> 01:04:09,011
This war

823
01:04:09,760 --> 01:04:12,321
is forcing us all to become razors

824
01:04:12,469 --> 01:04:14,695
because if we don't, we don't survive.

825
01:04:18,715 --> 01:04:22,122
And then we don't have the luxury
of becoming simply human again.

826
01:04:22,242 --> 01:04:23,945
Do you understand me?

827
01:04:30,507 --> 01:04:31,314
Good.

828
01:04:35,564 --> 01:04:36,586
Well done.

829
01:04:36,953 --> 01:04:38,542
Congratulations, Captain.

830
01:04:48,190 --> 01:04:50,105
<i>President Roslin's
recent executive order</i>

831
01:04:50,225 --> 01:04:52,515
<i>outlawing abortion
led to a demonstration...</i>

832
01:05:03,105 --> 01:05:06,942
Port side hull breaches.
Deck 4, fringes 12 to 14.

833
01:05:07,182 --> 01:05:09,157
Damage control crews
are sealing them off now.

834
01:05:10,337 --> 01:05:11,853
I'd say that's enough of that.

835
01:05:11,983 --> 01:05:13,573
Get the FTL offline.

836
01:05:14,063 --> 01:05:15,727
Bring her around. Heading...

837
01:05:15,931 --> 01:05:17,582
- 1-6-1, carom 0.
- Sir.

838
01:05:25,104 --> 01:05:26,424
They're pursuing, Sir.

839
01:05:27,139 --> 01:05:28,512
Let's hope they keep it up.

840
01:05:32,531 --> 01:05:33,899
<i>Looks like they bought it.</i>

841
01:05:34,019 --> 01:05:36,035
<i>Now, let's go get our Raptor crew.</i>

842
01:05:37,855 --> 01:05:40,472
Maybe this will be easier
than we thought.

843
01:05:41,868 --> 01:05:44,974
Guess again, two bandits inbound.
Show time, people.

844
01:05:50,050 --> 01:05:50,882
<i>Ready?</i>

845
01:06:15,700 --> 01:06:16,850
Go, go, go!

846
01:06:30,358 --> 01:06:32,080
Enemy target destroyed.

847
01:06:32,203 --> 01:06:36,424
All wings regroup and
continue pursuit of Battlestar Pegasus.

848
01:06:36,918 --> 01:06:38,204
Aye, your Command.

849
01:06:47,777 --> 01:06:48,923
Landing report.

850
01:06:51,116 --> 01:06:52,958
Red squad all accounted for.

851
01:06:53,087 --> 01:06:56,416
Speak for yourself, sarge.
I'm still counting fingers and toes.

852
01:06:56,543 --> 01:06:57,853
Knock it off, Hudson.

853
01:06:57,973 --> 01:06:59,961
Red squad, form up on me.

854
01:07:00,216 --> 01:07:03,065
Any ground
when our playing comes together?

855
01:07:03,315 --> 01:07:05,109
Red squad, on my mark.

856
01:07:05,841 --> 01:07:07,245
Fire thrusters.

857
01:07:18,095 --> 01:07:19,544
<i>Red 1, Pegasus.</i>

858
01:07:21,765 --> 01:07:25,043
Red 1, this is Pegasus actual.
Report mission and team status.

859
01:07:25,397 --> 01:07:28,554
<i>We're in, we were able to access
an airlock on one of the radio alarms.</i>

860
01:07:28,771 --> 01:07:31,660
<i>Proceeding toward the core, no contact,
no casualties.</i>

861
01:07:31,918 --> 01:07:33,366
<i>Stay frosty, kiddies.</i>

862
01:07:33,486 --> 01:07:36,164
<i>No telling how many of those toasters
they left watching the house.</i>

863
01:07:36,284 --> 01:07:38,890
Stop your yap, Hudson.
Maybe we won't have to find out.

864
01:07:40,136 --> 01:07:41,741
DaSilva, what do you read on thermals?{\Uncut version: DaSilva, what do you read on that thermos?}

865
01:07:42,014 --> 01:07:43,214
<i>One heat source.</i>

866
01:07:43,334 --> 01:07:44,665
<i>Could be biological.</i>

867
01:07:44,802 --> 01:07:46,782
<i>Near the core, but that's all.</i>

868
01:07:47,131 --> 01:07:49,380
<i>Wait. I'm picking up
three or more signatures.</i>

869
01:07:49,500 --> 01:07:53,185
<i>Two of them a pretty weak but they're
coming from about 30 meters ahead.</i>

870
01:07:54,103 --> 01:07:56,449
<i>Could be our people. Danny, take point.</i>

871
01:08:20,502 --> 01:08:22,929
- Holy frak.
- Get them out of there, go!

872
01:08:28,324 --> 01:08:29,283
Help us.

873
01:08:31,563 --> 01:08:33,416
Get them out of here. Come on!

874
01:08:35,475 --> 01:08:36,404
Cylons!

875
01:08:41,839 --> 01:08:43,727
Everybody out, now!

876
01:08:53,800 --> 01:08:54,832
Let's go!

877
01:08:58,523 --> 01:08:59,387
Come on!

878
01:09:02,785 --> 01:09:05,622
<i>Man down! They got DaSilva!</i>

879
01:09:26,137 --> 01:09:26,940
No!

880
01:09:44,365 --> 01:09:45,794
<i>Pegasus, Red 2.</i>

881
01:09:45,943 --> 01:09:47,244
<i>Come in, Pegasus.</i>

882
01:09:48,264 --> 01:09:50,225
Copy, Red 2 but your signal is weak.

883
01:09:50,345 --> 01:09:52,002
<i>Recovered two civilians.</i>

884
01:09:52,177 --> 01:09:54,772
<i>One dead, two wounded. Including the XO.</i>

885
01:09:55,500 --> 01:09:57,625
<i>We're pinned down, taking heavy fire.</i>

886
01:09:57,749 --> 01:09:59,668
<i>Mission out, come down forward.</i>

887
01:10:02,448 --> 01:10:04,994
Pegasus, Red 2. Come in, Pegasus.

888
01:10:05,576 --> 01:10:06,606
Pegasus.

889
01:10:07,321 --> 01:10:08,123
Frak.

890
01:10:08,285 --> 01:10:09,124
Captain!

891
01:10:09,332 --> 01:10:10,375
Sitrep!

892
01:10:12,488 --> 01:10:14,439
We just lost communications.

893
01:10:14,559 --> 01:10:16,999
- Cylons must be jamming.
- What about the nuke?

894
01:10:17,377 --> 01:10:19,509
How's that detonator coming, Mathias?

895
01:10:20,839 --> 01:10:22,428
Detonator's fried.

896
01:10:22,548 --> 01:10:23,732
Get it working.

897
01:10:32,678 --> 01:10:35,083
You want to tell me
what the hell that was with DaSilva?

898
01:10:35,230 --> 01:10:38,003
I'll not allow them
taking any more prisoners, Captain.

899
01:10:38,323 --> 01:10:41,398
- You saw what they were doing in there.
- Yes, I saw it.

900
01:10:42,491 --> 01:10:44,576
Keep trying to resume communications
with Red 2.

901
01:10:44,740 --> 01:10:45,680
Yes, Sir.

902
01:10:47,908 --> 01:10:48,981
Mr. Hoshi.

903
01:10:51,867 --> 01:10:53,085
Order nuclear

904
01:10:53,468 --> 01:10:55,509
ship-to-ship missile into launch tube 3.

905
01:10:55,629 --> 01:10:56,462
Aye, Sir.

906
01:10:57,097 --> 01:10:58,801
This is a nuclear mission order.

907
01:10:58,921 --> 01:11:01,322
Load ship-to-ship missile
into launch tube 3.

908
01:11:01,442 --> 01:11:03,990
- What are you doing?
- They've been compromised.

909
01:11:04,174 --> 01:11:07,682
We can't regain communications. We have
to assume that the team's been lost.

910
01:11:07,854 --> 01:11:09,814
We have to give them a chance.

911
01:11:11,940 --> 01:11:13,214
Commander Adama?

912
01:11:16,204 --> 01:11:19,194
- Open launch tube doors.
- Open launch tube doors.

913
01:11:21,796 --> 01:11:22,683
Major.

914
01:11:24,110 --> 01:11:25,783
Watch those quarters, Hudson.

915
01:11:26,437 --> 01:11:28,411
Pegasus, Red 2. Come in.

916
01:11:33,720 --> 01:11:37,164
Destroying that ship
with people on board is our last resort.

917
01:11:37,297 --> 01:11:39,896
Like it or not, Admiral,
this is no longer a rescue mission.

918
01:11:40,016 --> 01:11:43,045
Gods only know what will happen
to our people if they're captured.

919
01:11:43,165 --> 01:11:44,722
I know what'll happen.

920
01:11:45,145 --> 01:11:46,387
I was there.

921
01:11:47,045 --> 01:11:48,765
Nukes are loaded, Commander.

922
01:11:50,965 --> 01:11:53,390
Release of nuclear weapons
is authorized.

923
01:11:54,307 --> 01:11:56,025
Disable launch and warhead safeties.

924
01:11:56,159 --> 01:11:58,280
Mr. Hoshi, take your launch key.

925
01:11:58,466 --> 01:12:00,509
- Put it in the firing lock.
- Aye, Sir.

926
01:12:00,643 --> 01:12:02,118
Belay that order.

927
01:12:02,774 --> 01:12:05,522
I'm not prepared
to sacrifice any lives. Not yet.

928
01:12:05,642 --> 01:12:08,368
- And if you're wrong?
- Then I'll have to live with it.

929
01:12:15,831 --> 01:12:18,183
You said it yourself, Admiral.
That thing

930
01:12:18,420 --> 01:12:20,030
maybe headed toward Earth.

931
01:12:20,164 --> 01:12:22,919
If it jumps away, then we'll lose
our only hope of taking it out.

932
01:12:26,080 --> 01:12:27,710
Sir, jamming's clearing.

933
01:12:27,879 --> 01:12:29,597
Receiving a transmission from Red 2.

934
01:12:29,795 --> 01:12:32,127
- Put it through on speakers.
- Aye, Sir.

935
01:12:32,350 --> 01:12:33,745
Launch evac Raptor.

936
01:12:33,865 --> 01:12:35,806
<i>Pegasus, this is Red 2. Come in.</i>

937
01:12:38,851 --> 01:12:40,770
<i>Pegasus, this is Red 2. Come in.</i>

938
01:12:40,955 --> 01:12:41,760
Yes.

939
01:12:42,432 --> 01:12:45,405
Red 2, this is Pegasus actual.
Starbuck, report.

940
01:12:45,832 --> 01:12:47,478
Still pinned down but holding on.

941
01:12:47,654 --> 01:12:49,655
<i>Tell me there's a ride waiting for us.</i>

942
01:12:50,017 --> 01:12:51,575
On their way, Red 2.

943
01:12:52,663 --> 01:12:56,407
The Raiders've broken off their attack.
They'll be headed to you any second now.{\Uncut version: The Raiders've broken off their attack. They'll be headed toward your coordinate any second now.}

944
01:12:56,527 --> 01:12:57,684
<i>Roger that.</i>

945
01:12:57,804 --> 01:12:59,585
<i>We'll be running out of time.</i>

946
01:13:04,064 --> 01:13:07,093
Evac Raptor's on its way. They want us
to set the nuke and get the hell out.

947
01:13:07,422 --> 01:13:10,096
That's gonna be a problem.
Remote detonator's definitely shot.

948
01:13:10,820 --> 01:13:13,182
- Can you rig a manual trigger?
- Probably.

949
01:13:13,517 --> 01:13:14,662
Then do it.

950
01:13:15,046 --> 01:13:15,949
Do it?

951
01:13:16,306 --> 01:13:19,482
- What the hell are you talking about?
- We are completing this mission.

952
01:13:19,602 --> 01:13:20,982
Am I clear, soldier?

953
01:13:23,295 --> 01:13:24,337
Yes, Sir.

954
01:13:25,410 --> 01:13:28,197
<i>Red team, Pegasus. Evac ETA two minutes.</i>

955
01:13:29,968 --> 01:13:32,000
This is Red 2, give me actual.

956
01:13:34,003 --> 01:13:36,625
Red 2, this is actual.
What's taking you so long?

957
01:13:36,750 --> 01:13:38,386
They're gonna be on you any second.

958
01:13:38,506 --> 01:13:40,369
<i>Our nuke's remote detonator
is still fried.</i>

959
01:13:40,489 --> 01:13:42,419
<i>We're gonna have to cook it off by hand.</i>

960
01:13:42,800 --> 01:13:45,965
<i>Red 1 is still down for the count.
Witch doesn't give us many options.</i>

961
01:13:46,738 --> 01:13:48,492
What are your orders, Sir?

962
01:13:50,793 --> 01:13:53,043
We still got a missile in the tube.

963
01:13:53,484 --> 01:13:56,392
If that evac bird gets them off,
we could still fire this thing off.{\Uncut version: If that evac bird gets them off that ship, we could still fire this thing off.}

964
01:13:56,704 --> 01:13:58,352
- Mr. Hoshi.
- The Raiders are

965
01:13:58,514 --> 01:14:00,605
in their air defense position.

966
01:14:00,999 --> 01:14:03,631
You launch anything,
they gonna intercept it.

967
01:14:04,854 --> 01:14:06,736
Then we have to leave someone behind,

968
01:14:07,094 --> 01:14:08,704
arm the warhead manually.

969
01:14:09,209 --> 01:14:10,448
That's right.

970
01:14:15,335 --> 01:14:17,022
This is your team, son.

971
01:14:18,203 --> 01:14:19,707
You make the call.

972
01:14:30,451 --> 01:14:32,292
Red 2, this is Pegasus actual.

973
01:14:32,416 --> 01:14:35,807
Get the XO, get your men
and get to the evac coordinates.

974
01:14:35,969 --> 01:14:38,562
<i>Secure your men,
and detonate the warhead</i>

975
01:14:38,736 --> 01:14:40,044
<i>using the manual trigger.</i>

976
01:14:41,590 --> 01:14:43,653
Complete your mission, Captain.

977
01:14:45,469 --> 01:14:46,522
Understood.

978
01:14:47,247 --> 01:14:49,965
- Sergeant! Get ready to move out.
- Yes, Sir.

979
01:14:50,085 --> 01:14:53,383
All right, now get on your feet,
and I'll get you out of here.

980
01:14:58,284 --> 01:15:00,659
Come on everybody move,
it's time, let's go!

981
01:15:00,779 --> 01:15:02,071
Get your suits on.

982
01:15:02,546 --> 01:15:04,199
Come on, go, go, go!

983
01:15:11,223 --> 01:15:12,961
You too, Major. Let's get...

984
01:15:14,737 --> 01:15:15,888
You too, Captain.

985
01:15:17,278 --> 01:15:18,891
Leave the nuke, if you don't mind.

986
01:15:19,678 --> 01:15:21,587
What the frak are you doing?

987
01:15:22,140 --> 01:15:23,811
Completing the mission.

988
01:15:25,243 --> 01:15:26,295
Take it.

989
01:15:26,548 --> 01:15:28,281
I don't need it anymore.

990
01:15:28,627 --> 01:15:29,515
Major.

991
01:15:30,438 --> 01:15:32,573
I just gave you an order, soldier.

992
01:15:33,283 --> 01:15:34,835
Unless you wanna die,

993
01:15:34,990 --> 01:15:37,201
I suggest you obey it. Go.

994
01:15:51,019 --> 01:15:51,834
Why?

995
01:15:52,825 --> 01:15:54,481
You know damn well why.

996
01:15:55,556 --> 01:15:57,638
Put on your suit,
you're about to run out of air.

997
01:16:12,646 --> 01:16:14,194
<i>It's been an honor, Captain.</i>

998
01:16:43,358 --> 01:16:45,700
<i>All this has happened before</i>

999
01:16:46,391 --> 01:16:48,414
<i>and will happen again.</i>

1000
01:16:54,627 --> 01:16:58,159
<i>Come in, Major. I've been
waiting for you for a long time.</i>

1001
01:17:05,211 --> 01:17:07,194
You're what all this is about,
aren't you?

1002
01:17:09,530 --> 01:17:10,661
What are you?

1003
01:17:11,235 --> 01:17:13,045
What am I? A man.

1004
01:17:14,461 --> 01:17:16,384
Or am I a machine?

1005
01:17:19,704 --> 01:17:22,473
Our children will live by our God.

1006
01:17:24,661 --> 01:17:25,673
Are you...

1007
01:17:26,386 --> 01:17:27,397
a god?

1008
01:17:27,638 --> 01:17:29,371
I have seen things,

1009
01:17:30,385 --> 01:17:32,608
your life, Kendra Shaw,

1010
01:17:33,099 --> 01:17:34,606
the things you've done...

1011
01:17:35,338 --> 01:17:37,421
the things you felt you had to do...

1012
01:17:37,541 --> 01:17:39,589
all leading to this moment.

1013
01:17:41,074 --> 01:17:43,828
You wish to be forgiven, my child.

1014
01:17:46,242 --> 01:17:47,252
I repeat!

1015
01:17:47,841 --> 01:17:50,656
We will carry out this order!

1016
01:17:50,776 --> 01:17:52,628
We will shoot these people!

1017
01:17:55,340 --> 01:17:56,896
What are we doing, Sir?

1018
01:17:57,273 --> 01:17:58,074
Sir?

1019
01:18:48,474 --> 01:18:50,436
Do you wish to be forgiven?

1020
01:18:56,399 --> 01:18:59,134
- Yes.
- Then, come closer.

1021
01:18:59,440 --> 01:19:01,489
There's something I have to tell you.

1022
01:19:04,240 --> 01:19:05,042
Come.

1023
01:19:22,904 --> 01:19:26,699
Kara Thrace will lead
the human race to its end.

1024
01:19:28,561 --> 01:19:31,825
- What?
- She is the herald of the Apocalypse.

1025
01:19:32,179 --> 01:19:34,301
The harbinger of death.

1026
01:19:34,572 --> 01:19:36,524
They must not follow her.

1027
01:19:43,224 --> 01:19:46,829
<i>Pegasus, evac Raptor inbound.
Extraction complete. Cleared Baseship.</i>

1028
01:19:46,949 --> 01:19:48,976
Raptor is on its way back, Sir.

1029
01:19:49,718 --> 01:19:52,878
They have Starbuck aboard.
Major Shaw stayed behind.

1030
01:19:56,544 --> 01:19:57,336
Starbuck?

1031
01:19:58,384 --> 01:19:59,540
<i>Actual.</i>

1032
01:20:00,931 --> 01:20:02,180
<i>This is Red 1.</i>

1033
01:20:02,887 --> 01:20:03,901
<i>Come in.</i>

1034
01:20:04,443 --> 01:20:07,602
- Red 1, this is Pegasus Actual. Report.
<i>- Commander?</i>

1035
01:20:08,509 --> 01:20:09,759
<i>I gotta warn you.</i>

1036
01:20:09,900 --> 01:20:11,598
<i>It's Captain Thrace.</i>

1037
01:20:14,061 --> 01:20:16,480
- Red 1, report!
- They're jamming us again, Sir.

1038
01:20:16,812 --> 01:20:19,700
- Red 1, this is Actual, come in!
- We lost her.

1039
01:20:27,317 --> 01:20:28,331
Actual.

1040
01:20:30,052 --> 01:20:31,066
Come in.

1041
01:20:32,245 --> 01:20:33,164
Actual.

1042
01:20:35,928 --> 01:20:38,957
As my own existence comes to a close,

1043
01:20:40,195 --> 01:20:43,578
only to begin a new,
in ways... uncertain.

1044
01:20:49,123 --> 01:20:51,056
You're scared,
aren't you, mother-frakker?

1045
01:20:55,252 --> 01:20:56,643
You should be.

1046
01:20:57,397 --> 01:20:59,424
All this has happened before.

1047
01:21:00,214 --> 01:21:01,699
And will happen again.

1048
01:21:02,642 --> 01:21:03,491
Again.

1049
01:22:06,460 --> 01:22:08,208
You wanted to see me, Admiral.

1050
01:22:09,545 --> 01:22:11,101
Thank you for coming in.

1051
01:22:12,669 --> 01:22:14,437
Starbuck was here a little earlier.

1052
01:22:17,408 --> 01:22:19,145
She's recommended major Shaw

1053
01:22:19,306 --> 01:22:21,063
for a posthumous commendation.

1054
01:22:22,301 --> 01:22:24,108
She wasn't looking for medals.

1055
01:22:24,567 --> 01:22:25,753
No, she wasn't.

1056
01:22:27,304 --> 01:22:29,358
But I've been going through Cain's logs,

1057
01:22:30,293 --> 01:22:31,809
and from a tactical perspective,

1058
01:22:31,929 --> 01:22:34,783
it's hard to find a fault
in anything that she did,

1059
01:22:35,194 --> 01:22:36,631
or that Kendra did.

1060
01:22:37,326 --> 01:22:39,197
They butchered innocent civilians, Dad.

1061
01:22:43,189 --> 01:22:44,204
Come on.

1062
01:22:44,638 --> 01:22:46,189
How can you ignore that?

1063
01:22:46,736 --> 01:22:50,432
I know that I didn't have to face
any of the situations that she did.

1064
01:22:51,025 --> 01:22:52,964
I had the President in my face,

1065
01:22:53,203 --> 01:22:55,860
arguing for the survival
of the civilian fleet,

1066
01:22:56,853 --> 01:22:59,659
I had colonel Tigh to keep me honest,

1067
01:23:00,389 --> 01:23:03,720
balancing my morality and my tactics,
and I had you.

1068
01:23:05,316 --> 01:23:06,685
Now...

1069
01:23:07,392 --> 01:23:10,722
you don't have any children,
so you might not understand this,

1070
01:23:11,065 --> 01:23:13,848
but you see yourself
reflected in their eyes.

1071
01:23:15,216 --> 01:23:18,661
And there are some things that
I thought of doing, with this fleet.

1072
01:23:20,919 --> 01:23:22,635
But I stopped myself because I knew

1073
01:23:22,755 --> 01:23:25,219
that I'd have to face you
the following day.

1074
01:23:32,255 --> 01:23:33,886
If you hadn't been in CIC,

1075
01:23:36,304 --> 01:23:38,335
I would have ordered that strike.

1076
01:23:38,939 --> 01:23:41,676
Kara would be dead,
so would the rest of the team.

1077
01:23:42,201 --> 01:23:43,660
You did nothing wrong,

1078
01:23:44,185 --> 01:23:45,406
neither did I.

1079
01:23:46,957 --> 01:23:50,448
We both made decisions that we had to,
to accomplish our missions.

1080
01:23:51,531 --> 01:23:52,352
Yeah.

1081
01:23:54,291 --> 01:23:55,181
Cain.

1082
01:23:56,538 --> 01:23:57,725
Kendra.

1083
01:23:59,800 --> 01:24:01,009
Were they wrong?

1084
01:24:02,538 --> 01:24:04,751
And if I believed in the Gods,

1085
01:24:05,104 --> 01:24:07,753
I'd say they'll be judged
by a high power.

1086
01:24:08,263 --> 01:24:09,974
But since you don't believe...

1087
01:24:11,924 --> 01:24:14,593
Then history will have
to make its judgments.

1088
01:24:18,925 --> 01:24:22,011
And since history's first draft
will be written in our logs...

1089
01:24:26,525 --> 01:24:28,860
Well, I guess
I've got some writing to do.

1090
01:24:32,410 --> 01:24:35,107
You'll write that commendation.

1091
01:24:37,519 --> 01:24:38,734
Yeah, I will.

1092
01:25:07,283 --> 01:25:09,106
Not a lot to show for a life, huh?

1093
01:25:10,738 --> 01:25:11,783
I guess not.

1094
01:25:13,956 --> 01:25:15,741
Do you have any idea why she did it?

1095
01:25:19,215 --> 01:25:21,360
Maybe she thought
she had a lot to answer for.

1096
01:25:22,823 --> 01:25:24,204
Maybe she had it coming...

1097
01:25:27,416 --> 01:25:28,897
We've all got it coming.

1098
01:25:33,961 --> 01:25:36,145
You might as well hear this from me.

1099
01:25:37,797 --> 01:25:39,866
I've asked to be reassigned
to Galactica.

1100
01:25:42,044 --> 01:25:43,088
Any reason?

1101
01:25:43,876 --> 01:25:46,401
You might say that I've a beef
with my commanding officer.

1102
01:25:48,347 --> 01:25:49,714
And... what's that?

1103
01:25:50,967 --> 01:25:52,998
That mother-frakker keeps
trying to get me killed.

1104
01:25:56,321 --> 01:25:58,210
Oh, you ever think you might deserve it?

1105
01:25:59,610 --> 01:26:01,616
Speak for yourself, Lee, I...

1106
01:26:01,736 --> 01:26:02,913
have a destiny.

1107
01:26:03,787 --> 01:26:05,989
Had my palm read by a Cylon, remember?

1108
01:26:06,483 --> 01:26:07,888
A destiny, right?

1109
01:26:08,448 --> 01:26:10,926
You better believe that. So I guess, you

1110
01:26:11,049 --> 01:26:13,004
are stuck with me till the end.

1111
01:26:13,916 --> 01:26:16,004
I gotta go break in your new CAG,

1112
01:26:16,897 --> 01:26:17,732
Sir.
