1
00:00:37,579 --> 00:00:40,248
(plane overhead)

2
00:01:12,156 --> 00:01:13,239
(speaks German)

3
00:01:17,161 --> 00:01:19,287
- Americano.
- Sí, americano.

4
00:01:19,455 --> 00:01:22,290
(speaks German)

5
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:57,283
(German)

6
00:01:57,367 --> 00:02:00,286
Where is the flyer?
The flyer...the pilot!

7
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:01,370
(ltalian)

8
00:02:02,748 --> 00:02:04,916
- (makes plane noise)
- Ah! Pilota!

9
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,083
(explosion)

10
00:02:06,543 --> 00:02:07,835
Dead...finished.

11
00:02:12,216 --> 00:02:14,175
(German)

12
00:02:23,894 --> 00:02:25,895
(blow raspberries)

13
00:02:49,461 --> 00:02:52,046
(drum roll)

14
00:03:46,643 --> 00:03:48,144
(ltalian)

15
00:04:21,511 --> 00:04:23,512
Party, inward... turn!

16
00:04:25,057 --> 00:04:27,058
Party... flag!

17
00:04:32,522 --> 00:04:36,108
For as much as it hath pleased
Almighty God to take unto himself

18
00:04:36,193 --> 00:04:39,236
the soul of our dear brother
here departed,

19
00:04:39,321 --> 00:04:41,697
we therefore commit his body
to the ground.

20
00:04:44,368 --> 00:04:46,702
Uno, due, tre!

21
00:04:48,747 --> 00:04:51,832
(gunshots)

22
00:04:52,334 --> 00:04:54,877
( bugler plays "Taps")

23
00:05:14,231 --> 00:05:17,233
Detail, outward... turn!

24
00:05:19,111 --> 00:05:21,570
Detail... quick march!

25
00:05:39,548 --> 00:05:42,842
Major Fincham, will you now
please dismiss your men? Please.

26
00:05:42,926 --> 00:05:44,427
Where is your commandant?

27
00:05:44,511 --> 00:05:47,555
As l told you, Major Battaglia is indisposed.

28
00:05:47,889 --> 00:05:51,434
His orders are to disperse
immediately after the funeral.

29
00:05:51,935 --> 00:05:53,936
(blows whistle)

30
00:05:55,522 --> 00:05:59,025
- Major Fincham, please.
- Get that Fascist bastard out here!

31
00:06:01,903 --> 00:06:05,656
Captain, this is the American
colonel whose airplane crashed.

32
00:06:06,158 --> 00:06:08,159
Grazie.

33
00:06:09,911 --> 00:06:14,248
- You'd better follow me, please, Colonel.
- Thanks, pal.

34
00:06:26,428 --> 00:06:28,679
What are they celebrating out there?

35
00:06:33,351 --> 00:06:35,352
Signor maggiore.

36
00:06:36,146 --> 00:06:39,315
Major, the prisoners respectfully
ask to see you.

37
00:06:43,153 --> 00:06:45,654
Respectfully! You were ordered
to disperse them!

38
00:06:46,364 --> 00:06:51,035
Ryan, Joseph L.
United States Army Air Corps. 071 8359.

39
00:06:53,288 --> 00:06:56,582
Don't you salute senior officers
in your army, Major?

40
00:06:58,335 --> 00:07:00,252
The colonel crashed
in his plane...

41
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:03,214
- Are you the official interpreter?
- Yes, sir.

42
00:07:03,298 --> 00:07:06,342
- Then interpret exactly. Clear?
- Yes, sir.

43
00:07:07,302 --> 00:07:11,305
(repeats Ryan's question in ltalian)

44
00:07:12,516 --> 00:07:17,353
And add this: No wonder ltaly's
losing the war, with officers like him.

45
00:07:18,605 --> 00:07:19,688
Well?

46
00:07:20,857 --> 00:07:22,858
(translates)

47
00:07:31,535 --> 00:07:34,537
(men shouting) Battaglia! Battaglia!

48
00:07:34,621 --> 00:07:37,414
Battaglia! Battaglia!

49
00:07:37,499 --> 00:07:41,544
Battaglia! Battaglia! Battaglia!

50
00:07:41,628 --> 00:07:44,213
Battaglia! Battaglia!

51
00:07:45,382 --> 00:07:49,552
We have today buried
our commanding officer,

52
00:07:50,262 --> 00:07:52,930
Colonel Brian David Lockart!

53
00:07:54,015 --> 00:07:58,060
The purpose of this parade
is to bear witness to his death

54
00:07:58,728 --> 00:08:01,355
and charge the man responsible for it!

55
00:08:02,566 --> 00:08:04,567
Major Battaglia!

56
00:08:05,735 --> 00:08:11,615
The Ninth Fusiliers now formally charge you
with the murder of Colonel Lockart!

57
00:08:11,908 --> 00:08:14,743
Come forward and meet your accusers!

58
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,121
(translates)

59
00:08:21,126 --> 00:08:25,421
They accuse me? Why, they're
crazy! Clear them off the field!

60
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:26,964
Sí, signor maggiore.

61
00:08:27,048 --> 00:08:29,842
(men shout) Battaglia! Battaglia!

62
00:08:30,969 --> 00:08:31,969
Follow me, please.

63
00:08:32,304 --> 00:08:36,515
(men chant) Battaglia! Battaglia! Battaglia!

64
00:08:39,436 --> 00:08:41,520
(shouts command in ltalian)

65
00:08:41,771 --> 00:08:44,273
(men continue chanting)

66
00:08:48,862 --> 00:08:53,282
Major Fincham, unless you dismiss
your men now, it will be out of my hands.

67
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:56,869
- That swine hasn't the guts.
- You have left him no choice.

68
00:08:56,953 --> 00:08:58,662
(men murmur)

69
00:08:59,664 --> 00:09:01,123
You've shot one of my men!

70
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:04,793
He's fainted, sir. lt's Ransom.
One of those from hospital.

71
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:09,798
Dismiss.

72
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:16,222
Parade... dismiss!

73
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:22,811
Captain Stein! One moment.

74
00:09:23,188 --> 00:09:26,315
This is Colonel Ryan.
He needs your attention too.

75
00:09:35,283 --> 00:09:37,826
- American.
- Army Air Corps.

76
00:09:44,918 --> 00:09:48,420
Begging your pardon, sir.
Are we still beating them in Sicily?

77
00:09:48,672 --> 00:09:51,715
- We took Messina three days ago.
- (men cheer)

78
00:10:12,988 --> 00:10:15,030
Are you reporting for sick parade, Sergeant?

79
00:10:15,115 --> 00:10:16,365
No, sir.

80
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:19,618
l'm still trying to get
what my boys have needed all along.

81
00:10:19,703 --> 00:10:23,706
l'm afraid l still have the same answer
for you: there isn't any.

82
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:35,801
Easy, fellas. Easy.

83
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:38,304
Over here, Colonel.

84
00:10:47,731 --> 00:10:49,398
The stool will do.

85
00:10:50,692 --> 00:10:54,862
- Looks like you got a full house.
- And getting fuller, l'm afraid.

86
00:10:55,196 --> 00:10:57,948
- What's the matter with these men?
- Malaria, scurvy.

87
00:10:58,033 --> 00:11:00,117
Made worse by malnutrition.

88
00:11:00,994 --> 00:11:04,830
- l've only alcohol for a disinfectant.
- Go right ahead, Doc.

89
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:08,667
How come you can't control
the malaria with drugs?

90
00:11:08,752 --> 00:11:10,336
The Eyeties make no mepacrine.

91
00:11:11,421 --> 00:11:14,715
The Eyeties grow food.
Get extra rations for your sick.

92
00:11:14,924 --> 00:11:16,550
And clean up some of this filth.

93
00:11:16,634 --> 00:11:19,386
And perhaps get 'em some clean uniforms.

94
00:11:19,763 --> 00:11:23,515
Our diet and filth are Battaglia's
punishment for escape attempts.

95
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:27,311
He's taken our soap and razors,
turned off our shower baths,

96
00:11:27,395 --> 00:11:32,358
issued us with no uniforms or Red Cross
parcels, and kept us on half rations.

97
00:11:32,442 --> 00:11:36,028
But he can't break us,
and he can't stop us trying to escape.

98
00:11:36,446 --> 00:11:38,155
Even with the way
the war is going for us now?

99
00:11:39,074 --> 00:11:41,450
Are you suggesting
we should knuckle under?

100
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:45,454
lf that's what it takes, yes.
Liberation can only be a few weeks away.

101
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:49,625
Did you hear the colonel's suggestion,
fellas?

102
00:11:50,335 --> 00:11:52,002
What do you think?

103
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:56,632
Well... meanin' no disrespect to him, sir,

104
00:11:57,342 --> 00:12:01,637
- l'd say the colonel ought to muck off, sir.
- (murmurs of agreement)

105
00:12:03,306 --> 00:12:07,976
l can't expect you to understand this,
but these men belong to the Ninth Fusiliers.

106
00:12:08,061 --> 00:12:11,522
This regiment fought
with Marlborough in 1 704,

107
00:12:11,648 --> 00:12:14,817
with Wellington against Napoleon,
and in the Crimea.

108
00:12:14,901 --> 00:12:19,571
These men are all volunteers, professionals,
and they've come to fight a war.

109
00:12:21,116 --> 00:12:24,410
lt may come as news to you, Major,
but that's why we're all here.

110
00:12:24,494 --> 00:12:28,789
Yes, but each in his different way. You
ought to know that. You're a professional.

111
00:12:28,873 --> 00:12:32,751
Negative. l'm what they call at home
a 90-day wonder.

112
00:12:33,128 --> 00:12:35,796
l'm an airplane driver. My business is flying.

113
00:12:36,131 --> 00:12:37,423
Ours is soldiering.

114
00:12:37,882 --> 00:12:42,177
OK, clue me. Suppose you do rig an escape.
How many men do you figure to get clear?

115
00:12:42,762 --> 00:12:46,515
- Colonel Ryan, if one gets out, it's a victory.
- Sure it is.

116
00:12:48,017 --> 00:12:50,185
Can somebody show me where l bunk?

117
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:51,854
- Sergeant Major.
- Sir?

118
00:12:51,938 --> 00:12:54,565
- Escort Colonel Ryan to his quarters.
- Yes, sir.

119
00:12:54,941 --> 00:12:56,692
We dine at six, sir.

120
00:12:58,403 --> 00:13:00,529
- Major.
- This way, Colonel.

121
00:13:15,044 --> 00:13:17,921
Sergeant Bostick, sir. 1 1 3th Tank Division.

122
00:13:19,382 --> 00:13:22,342
This is Corporal Giannini, and Private Ames.

123
00:13:23,052 --> 00:13:27,181
The reason we didn't say anything to you
in the sickbay, we wanted to get you alone.

124
00:13:27,265 --> 00:13:29,266
They've all gone to mess.

125
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:33,103
- Are you cold, son?
- lt's that damn malaria.

126
00:13:33,188 --> 00:13:37,691
Don't knock it, Bostick. You ever have it,
Colonel? The fever makes you dream.

127
00:13:37,775 --> 00:13:39,234
And, man, what dreams!
You know what l mean, sir?

128
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:43,071
- No. What?
- Well, they...

129
00:13:44,699 --> 00:13:47,284
Hey. He's pretty sharp, huh?

130
00:13:47,619 --> 00:13:51,872
You're a welcome sight, sir.
We need an American officer real bad.

131
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,336
- How many of us are there?
- Eight. We've lost two.

132
00:13:57,545 --> 00:14:01,924
And if we don't get some decent grub and
medicine, that's gonna double and triple.

133
00:14:02,008 --> 00:14:05,427
That's tough. From what l've seen,
everybody's in the same boat.

134
00:14:05,512 --> 00:14:07,763
Sure, because the guys running it
are section eight.

135
00:14:08,598 --> 00:14:12,851
Those stir-crazy limey officers
are trying to fight the war from in here.

136
00:14:12,936 --> 00:14:15,521
They got so many tunnels dug,
you could fall into one.

137
00:14:16,314 --> 00:14:19,733
- You expect me to keep them from digging?
- You got the rank for it, sir.

138
00:14:19,817 --> 00:14:24,947
Don't get us wrong, sir. Nobody's here to
defend Battaglia. He's a two-bit Mussolini.

139
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:27,074
But if they'd let up, he would too.

140
00:14:27,158 --> 00:14:28,200
With Sicily gone,

141
00:14:28,284 --> 00:14:32,454
our guys will come through ltaly
like shoe polish through a tin horn.

142
00:14:32,539 --> 00:14:35,832
All we gotta do is get healthy,
sit tight and wait.

143
00:14:35,917 --> 00:14:40,254
These people have been here for two years.
l just got here. l need time to check this out.

144
00:14:40,755 --> 00:14:45,342
Not too long. Please, sir.
Three of my boys are just about gone now.

145
00:15:13,288 --> 00:15:17,499
Colonel Ryan, this is Captain Costanzo,
our regimental chaplain.

146
00:15:17,584 --> 00:15:19,376
- Lieutenant Orde.
- Lieutenant.

147
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:21,878
- Delighted, Colonel Ryan.
- Please sit down. Sorry l kept you waiting.

148
00:15:23,464 --> 00:15:25,048
Colonel Lockart always sat here.

149
00:15:28,803 --> 00:15:31,054
l'll be fine right here. Thank you.

150
00:15:42,442 --> 00:15:46,028
Major, if you don't mind talking about it,
how did your colonel buy it?

151
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:50,449
He struck Battaglia with his stick.

152
00:15:51,159 --> 00:15:53,452
Do you see that sweatbox there?

153
00:15:54,412 --> 00:15:56,496
Colonel Lockart died in there last night.

154
00:15:56,581 --> 00:15:58,957
Which makes you
the senior officer of this camp.

155
00:16:01,127 --> 00:16:02,794
My regiment will await your orders.

156
00:16:12,388 --> 00:16:13,722
lt's still your regiment, Major.

157
00:16:17,226 --> 00:16:18,727
Thank you, sir.

158
00:16:28,071 --> 00:16:30,530
lt's made from pumpkins, you know.

159
00:16:31,157 --> 00:16:33,950
Just a little different, don't you think?

160
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:43,669
We couldn't help noticing
where you sat, Colonel.

161
00:16:43,753 --> 00:16:47,089
lt took 200 years to make officers
like those. lt took me 90 days.

162
00:16:47,173 --> 00:16:49,758
- They're nuts, sir.
- lt's their ball game.

163
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:52,469
- We're still shut out.
- We did as good with a sergeant.

164
00:16:52,553 --> 00:16:54,012
Now we got us a bird colonel.

165
00:16:55,890 --> 00:16:58,725
A bird colonel outranks a birdbrain. Clear?

166
00:16:59,936 --> 00:17:01,978
- Anything else, Sergeant?
- No, sir.

167
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:08,276
Bird is right. Chicken.

168
00:17:08,653 --> 00:17:11,279
OK, OK. Now we know we're on our own.

169
00:17:40,852 --> 00:17:43,311
- Do you feel up to a bit of running, sir?
- Running?

170
00:17:43,396 --> 00:17:46,606
Dodging the lights, l mean.
lt's pretty important.

171
00:19:02,975 --> 00:19:05,852
- What the hell is this?
- Earth, sir, from the tunnel.

172
00:19:05,937 --> 00:19:10,982
We reckon the barracks ceiling can hold
two tons of it if we spread it around right.

173
00:19:42,348 --> 00:19:45,433
Sorry to ask you to make this trip,
but l thought you ought to be here.

174
00:19:46,936 --> 00:19:50,272
Your countrymen were caught
trying to steal supplies.

175
00:19:53,359 --> 00:19:57,946
- What supplies, Major?
- Escape rations. See for yourself.

176
00:20:38,946 --> 00:20:40,697
These men are thieves.

177
00:20:40,781 --> 00:20:44,659
But since they're Americans,
l wanted your approval to punish them.

178
00:20:44,744 --> 00:20:45,827
What's your side?

179
00:20:46,203 --> 00:20:48,413
My boys need things from those parcels, sir.

180
00:20:48,497 --> 00:20:52,709
- Food. And more important, mepacrine.
- That true, Major?

181
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:55,837
Perfectly. But these men are thieves
and should be punished.

182
00:20:55,922 --> 00:20:57,923
Negative. These men are sick.

183
00:20:58,007 --> 00:21:00,759
You've also got 50 men in sickbay
with the same disease.

184
00:21:00,843 --> 00:21:04,763
- What the hell are you doing about that?
- War produces casualties, Colonel.

185
00:21:04,847 --> 00:21:07,390
Everyone in camp's
been exposed to malaria.

186
00:21:07,475 --> 00:21:09,392
The only way a man has a chance of escape

187
00:21:09,477 --> 00:21:12,395
is for him to have mepacrine
to keep him going.

188
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:16,441
Forget the punishment, Major. Bostick,
get these men outta here. See me later.

189
00:21:16,525 --> 00:21:18,777
- My boys are sick, sir.
- Out.

190
00:21:24,158 --> 00:21:27,827
- Major, move those parcels to the sickbay.
- What did you say?

191
00:21:29,538 --> 00:21:32,082
- That's a direct order.
- Damn your direct order!

192
00:21:32,166 --> 00:21:36,586
l'm the ranking officer here. You'll deliver
those parcels tonight. ls that clear, mister?

193
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:45,595
You'd better know what you're doing,
unless you want a mutiny on your hands.

194
00:21:46,889 --> 00:21:48,807
Mutiny in the Ninth Fusiliers?

195
00:21:48,891 --> 00:21:53,019
Wellington and Marlborough would
spin in their graves, Major, what?

196
00:21:56,732 --> 00:22:01,778
(counting in ltalian)

197
00:22:02,947 --> 00:22:08,368
321 present, 83 in hospital,
404 men present or accounted for.

198
00:22:08,911 --> 00:22:11,621
- You may dismiss.
- lf you don't mind, Captain,

199
00:22:11,706 --> 00:22:13,748
l'm assuming command
as senior officer of the camp.

200
00:22:16,085 --> 00:22:19,587
That is, of course, between you.
l will inform Major Battaglia.

201
00:22:20,131 --> 00:22:21,756
l'd rather do that personally.
Will you take me to him?

202
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:26,845
Rest the men, Major, but keep them here.

203
00:22:31,058 --> 00:22:33,018
Stand at... ease!

204
00:22:34,270 --> 00:22:35,645
Stand easy.

205
00:22:40,109 --> 00:22:41,568
( classical music)

206
00:22:41,652 --> 00:22:44,487
- (knocking)
- Avanti!

207
00:22:47,825 --> 00:22:50,368
(announces Colonel Ryan in ltalian)

208
00:23:11,932 --> 00:23:12,974
(speaks in ltalian)

209
00:23:29,492 --> 00:23:33,703
My major warns you that he has
no patience left with the prisoners.

210
00:23:33,788 --> 00:23:37,749
By taking command, you have become
personally responsible for their actions.

211
00:23:37,833 --> 00:23:38,958
Good.

212
00:23:39,877 --> 00:23:41,586
And tell him that, from now on,

213
00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:44,631
things will be much more different
than they've been.

214
00:23:44,715 --> 00:23:46,341
(translates)

215
00:23:49,345 --> 00:23:50,637
(ltalian)

216
00:23:58,104 --> 00:24:00,772
You have made a good impression
on the major.

217
00:24:00,856 --> 00:24:03,399
But he warns you
against trying to trick him.

218
00:24:03,484 --> 00:24:05,276
Never. Of course not.

219
00:24:06,112 --> 00:24:08,488
Ask the major to come with me now.

220
00:24:08,572 --> 00:24:12,033
l'll prove how different things'll be
around this camp.

221
00:24:12,576 --> 00:24:13,993
(translates)

222
00:24:16,413 --> 00:24:34,347
(ltalian)

223
00:24:35,391 --> 00:24:37,100
(prisoners grumble)

224
00:24:47,903 --> 00:24:50,155
What in heaven's name is he doing?

225
00:24:50,239 --> 00:24:52,115
What does it look like?

226
00:24:53,534 --> 00:24:56,703
Ryan!

227
00:24:57,413 --> 00:25:01,708
Ryan, you can't do this.
You can't do this to anyone.

228
00:25:01,792 --> 00:25:06,421
- l'm glad you could join us, Major.
- lf you betray us, you'll pay for it.

229
00:25:06,505 --> 00:25:07,505
You're just in time to watch.

230
00:25:07,590 --> 00:25:11,259
Have the men turn about face
so they can watch too. Major?

231
00:25:13,304 --> 00:25:15,763
Sergeant Bostick, rip up that shower floor.

232
00:25:18,642 --> 00:25:23,605
Parade... about... turn!

233
00:25:40,456 --> 00:25:42,874
- (angry shouts)
- All right. Now hear this.

234
00:25:44,043 --> 00:25:49,839
While l'm in command, anyone attempting
to escape will be held for court martial.

235
00:25:49,924 --> 00:25:51,966
- Clear?
- (angry outburst)

236
00:25:53,010 --> 00:25:55,303
Stand steady on parade!

237
00:25:56,013 --> 00:25:58,890
You'll get the Nazi lron Cross
for this, Von Ryan!

238
00:25:59,934 --> 00:26:05,313
By order of the commandant, the showers
will be turned on at 1 200 hours.

239
00:26:06,315 --> 00:26:09,859
Razors will be provided
and delousing powder issued.

240
00:26:10,819 --> 00:26:15,031
Beginning tonight, Red Cross parcels
will be distributed once a week.

241
00:26:16,408 --> 00:26:19,327
- You may dismiss the parade.
- Not so fast, Captain.

242
00:26:19,411 --> 00:26:22,747
What about the clothing in the Red Cross
parcels in that storage house?

243
00:26:22,831 --> 00:26:26,084
- (ltalian)
- l advise you to forget this matter.

244
00:26:26,293 --> 00:26:29,754
Sure, because Battaglia's got
a black market going in Red Cross clothes.

245
00:26:29,838 --> 00:26:30,880
Right?

246
00:26:30,965 --> 00:26:34,884
You tell this man l trusted him
as a gentleman. l want those clothes.

247
00:26:34,969 --> 00:26:36,678
(speaking ltalian)

248
00:26:43,894 --> 00:26:46,729
l'm sorry. The major says
he cannot issue... wine.

249
00:26:47,064 --> 00:26:51,818
Wine? Who the hell said anything
about wine? l'm talking about clothes.

250
00:26:52,861 --> 00:26:55,196
lt's for your own good, Colonel.

251
00:26:56,490 --> 00:26:59,033
You let yourself be bought
pretty cheaply, didn't you?

252
00:26:59,827 --> 00:27:02,287
Louse powder and hot water? Hah!

253
00:27:03,205 --> 00:27:05,957
- Orde, dismiss the men.
- l'll tell you when to dismiss, Lieutenant.

254
00:27:06,792 --> 00:27:11,129
Bostick, tear the door off that bathhouse,
and use anything else you might need.

255
00:27:11,213 --> 00:27:12,547
Right, sir.

256
00:27:13,716 --> 00:27:16,050
Major Fincham, you will give
an order for the men to strip.

257
00:27:17,511 --> 00:27:19,929
Strip. Understand? Naked.

258
00:27:30,149 --> 00:27:33,234
Parade... strip.

259
00:27:37,072 --> 00:27:40,241
Now take off all of those rags. All of them!

260
00:27:42,745 --> 00:27:45,663
And, Major,
that goes for the officers as well.

261
00:27:48,125 --> 00:27:52,920
Pass that junk from the rear to the front
of the line and throw it in the fire!

262
00:27:54,089 --> 00:27:55,506
(laughter)

263
00:28:06,018 --> 00:28:07,060
(ltalian)

264
00:28:07,144 --> 00:28:10,438
Captain, the prisoners
are burning their clothes!

265
00:28:18,113 --> 00:28:22,116
You're quite right...the prisoners
are indeed burning their clothes.

266
00:28:27,122 --> 00:28:29,123
l must put a stop to this,
of course.

267
00:28:30,125 --> 00:28:32,293
Get Major Battaglia.
l'll wait here.

268
00:28:48,977 --> 00:28:51,646
Captain Costanzo, l said strip.

269
00:28:52,314 --> 00:28:55,525
Sir, l take being
a member of the cloth literally.

270
00:28:55,609 --> 00:28:57,068
(men laugh)

271
00:28:58,904 --> 00:29:01,030
l bow to your convictions, Captain.

272
00:29:07,287 --> 00:29:10,289
- Here comes ll Duce!
- Attention!

273
00:29:11,834 --> 00:29:14,836
(shouting in ltalian)

274
00:29:19,383 --> 00:29:21,592
The major feels the fire
should be put out at once.

275
00:29:24,012 --> 00:29:25,430
Tell him we have no firefighting equipment.

276
00:29:25,514 --> 00:29:27,056
(translates)

277
00:29:27,141 --> 00:29:28,391
(ltalian)

278
00:29:30,018 --> 00:29:31,894
- (whistle)
- (laughter)

279
00:29:40,362 --> 00:29:41,612
(ltalian)

280
00:29:41,738 --> 00:29:43,698
Save the clothes!
Save the clothes!

281
00:30:21,403 --> 00:30:25,364
- He says you are no gentleman, Colonel.
- Only by an act of Congress.

282
00:30:25,449 --> 00:30:26,949
Now what about the clothing?

283
00:30:27,034 --> 00:30:32,413
(ltalian)

284
00:30:38,545 --> 00:30:41,297
The prisoners will be issued clothing,
Colonel Ryan.

285
00:30:41,757 --> 00:30:44,592
But you, sir, l'm afraid, must follow me.

286
00:30:50,641 --> 00:30:52,642
(shouts order in ltalian)

287
00:30:55,062 --> 00:30:56,103
Good show, Colonel!

288
00:31:09,952 --> 00:31:12,745
Major Fincham!
You may dismiss when ready.

289
00:31:37,354 --> 00:31:38,354
(faraway voices)

290
00:31:44,236 --> 00:31:45,987
(lock being opened)

291
00:31:48,991 --> 00:31:53,744
(Bostick) We made it, Colonel. Our guys
landed at Salerno. ltaly's surrendered.

292
00:31:56,415 --> 00:32:00,668
That's great. Just great.

293
00:32:00,752 --> 00:32:01,919
Yeah. Our guys are ready to shove off,

294
00:32:02,004 --> 00:32:05,172
but these limeys back here
are giving us trouble.

295
00:32:05,882 --> 00:32:07,925
Hello, sir. Are you all right?

296
00:32:08,010 --> 00:32:10,928
Could you come right away?
There's trouble.

297
00:32:33,785 --> 00:32:36,287
- There are no guards.
- They bolted during the night.

298
00:32:36,371 --> 00:32:40,124
Major Fincham took Battaglia prisoner.
He's court-martialling him.

299
00:32:40,208 --> 00:32:45,963
Let the regimental records show Captain
Stein appearing as defending officer,

300
00:32:46,548 --> 00:32:50,885
Lieutenant Orde as prosecuting officer.
Major Fincham presiding.

301
00:32:52,512 --> 00:32:54,305
lf the court pleases.

302
00:32:54,806 --> 00:32:59,268
- Colonel Ryan, this is no affair of yours.
- l'm still the senior officer in this camp.

303
00:32:59,686 --> 00:33:03,230
We're holding a summary court martial
exactly according to regulations.

304
00:33:03,774 --> 00:33:06,400
What happens when you find him guilty,
according to regulations?

305
00:33:07,736 --> 00:33:11,238
- He will be hanged.
- That'll be murder. He's now a civilian.

306
00:33:11,448 --> 00:33:15,493
No, sir. We're still at war,
and the enemy is still the enemy.

307
00:33:15,577 --> 00:33:18,621
- (man) l say hang him!
- (shouts of agreement)

308
00:33:21,750 --> 00:33:24,335
Major, release this man.
Oriani, get him outta here.

309
00:33:25,295 --> 00:33:28,422
- (uproar)
- The parade will stand at ease!

310
00:33:28,507 --> 00:33:30,299
(pleading in ltalian)

311
00:33:45,107 --> 00:33:48,484
- (Battaglia continues pleading)
- (hostile shouting)

312
00:33:51,822 --> 00:33:54,699
The major begs me to say that

313
00:33:55,701 --> 00:33:57,702
he never meant you harm.

314
00:33:57,786 --> 00:34:01,622
lt was Mussolini and his Fascists
who forced him to be harsh.

315
00:34:03,959 --> 00:34:06,293
Now it's all finished for ltaly.

316
00:34:07,421 --> 00:34:10,339
- Let the killing be finished too.
- (murmurs from crowd)

317
00:34:15,262 --> 00:34:16,846
You want your revenge with this?

318
00:34:17,639 --> 00:34:19,140
l want justice.

319
00:34:20,016 --> 00:34:25,062
Not only for Colonel Lockart and the other
dead, but for those of us who are still alive.

320
00:34:25,147 --> 00:34:27,022
We're 200 miles behind the lines.

321
00:34:27,107 --> 00:34:28,899
l say not only military justice

322
00:34:28,984 --> 00:34:32,653
but military sense dictates
we cannot turn this man loose.

323
00:34:32,738 --> 00:34:35,322
- (men) Aye!
- There's a better way, Major.

324
00:34:35,407 --> 00:34:37,908
- You all want justice?
- (men) Yes!

325
00:34:38,201 --> 00:34:41,287
Then do to him what he did to your colonel.
Put him in a sweatbox to rot.

326
00:34:41,496 --> 00:34:42,580
- No!
- (men) Yes!

327
00:35:07,522 --> 00:35:08,856
(cheering)

328
00:35:12,027 --> 00:35:13,319
You fool.

329
00:35:13,862 --> 00:35:17,823
- You soft-headed, sentimental fool.
- That's privilege of rank, Major.

330
00:35:17,908 --> 00:35:23,454
Damn your rank. lf letting that scum live
costs the life of one of my men, l promise...

331
00:35:23,538 --> 00:35:24,705
(plane)

332
00:35:28,043 --> 00:35:30,586
Scatter! Hit the deck! Hit the deck!

333
00:35:46,937 --> 00:35:49,313
He pinpointed us. We'd better move quick.

334
00:35:49,397 --> 00:35:53,025
- Brilliant, Colonel. Where?
- We're a day's march from the coast.

335
00:35:53,109 --> 00:35:56,529
- l could contact your navy.
- Move 400 men in daylight? You're mad.

336
00:35:56,613 --> 00:35:58,364
- l'll lead you.
- Why should you?

337
00:35:58,448 --> 00:36:00,658
You think you hate the Germans
more than l do?

338
00:36:00,742 --> 00:36:03,202
- lt's worth a chance.
- l don't trust the Eyeties.

339
00:36:03,286 --> 00:36:06,413
But l'm in command here
and l say we move - now.

340
00:36:44,661 --> 00:36:45,786
Halt!

341
00:36:49,499 --> 00:36:51,750
German convoy! Everybody down!

342
00:37:21,156 --> 00:37:23,198
Those ruins could hide a thousand men.

343
00:37:23,283 --> 00:37:27,703
Let them rest there for the night
while l go ahead and contact the ships.

344
00:37:28,455 --> 00:37:30,664
How much farther to the coast?

345
00:37:30,957 --> 00:37:34,710
Five... perhaps six miles.
l should be back well before dawn.

346
00:37:34,794 --> 00:37:38,213
That's as pretty a place for a trap
as l've ever seen.

347
00:37:38,882 --> 00:37:42,509
Good luck, Oriani. We'll be
waiting for you. Now let's go.

348
00:37:50,185 --> 00:37:51,644
(pounding)

349
00:37:58,944 --> 00:38:00,736
(vehicle approaching)

350
00:38:08,828 --> 00:38:10,579
(shouting in German)

351
00:38:15,835 --> 00:38:23,717
(German)

352
00:38:26,429 --> 00:38:27,763
(pounding)

353
00:38:40,610 --> 00:38:42,403
(pounding continues)

354
00:38:43,738 --> 00:38:50,619
(German)

355
00:38:52,414 --> 00:38:53,706
(ltalian)

356
00:39:01,089 --> 00:39:02,297
Kamerad.

357
00:39:53,475 --> 00:39:54,725
(whistle)

358
00:40:23,338 --> 00:40:24,838
Face it, Yank.

359
00:40:25,632 --> 00:40:28,342
Your little Eyetie chum has deserted us.

360
00:40:28,968 --> 00:40:30,719
We're left in a box.

361
00:40:31,346 --> 00:40:33,180
(sentry) Colonel!

362
00:40:34,808 --> 00:40:36,600
- Something's moving!
- (gunshots)

363
00:40:37,227 --> 00:40:38,519
Out! Out!

364
00:40:38,978 --> 00:40:41,105
- Germans! Scatter!
- (gunshots)

365
00:40:41,189 --> 00:40:43,524
Scatter! Scatter! Come on!

366
00:41:02,544 --> 00:41:03,836
(German)

367
00:41:05,338 --> 00:41:07,548
(shouts orders in German)

368
00:41:12,345 --> 00:41:43,876
(shouts in German)

369
00:42:06,274 --> 00:42:07,482
OK. Now.

370
00:42:10,403 --> 00:42:12,196
Hold it. Hold it!

371
00:42:27,128 --> 00:42:30,255
Colonel Ryan, Major Fincham,
Captain Stein and Costanzo,

372
00:42:30,340 --> 00:42:32,466
Lieutenant Orde - the front car.

373
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:34,176
l'm a doctor. l stay with the wounded.

374
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:39,097
They will remain behind so we can care
for them properly. Get aboard, gentlemen.

375
00:42:44,103 --> 00:42:48,273
That little Eyetie bastard Oriani
led us to the railhead and turned us in.

376
00:42:55,156 --> 00:42:56,990
(speaking in ltalian)

377
00:43:04,123 --> 00:43:06,833
lt was that pig who betrayed us!

378
00:43:07,085 --> 00:43:08,585
l'll kill you!

379
00:43:09,837 --> 00:43:12,464
- (machine-gun fire)
- (men screaming)

380
00:43:17,011 --> 00:43:21,014
They've cared for our wounded
properly now. The poor bastards.

381
00:43:21,516 --> 00:43:23,850
Just cos you let Battaglia live!

382
00:43:24,185 --> 00:43:27,729
You'll get your lron Cross now, Von Ryan.

383
00:43:56,217 --> 00:43:58,218
(train gets ready to move)

384
00:44:23,077 --> 00:44:27,664
Hey, the roads are full of Germans.
lt means we must still be headed north.

385
00:44:37,925 --> 00:44:38,925
You can bet on it, Yank.

386
00:44:39,010 --> 00:44:42,137
Von Ryan's got us all
a one-way ticket to the Fatherland.

387
00:44:42,221 --> 00:44:45,515
- (men) Yeah!
- Aw, blow it out your barracks bag, mate.

388
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:48,435
Listen, l'll take you on any time you like!

389
00:44:52,815 --> 00:44:54,358
(train whistle)

390
00:46:06,347 --> 00:46:08,348
We are coming in to Rome.

391
00:46:29,245 --> 00:46:31,371
(soldier shouts in German)

392
00:47:31,015 --> 00:47:34,935
I am Major von Klement,
now in command of this prison train.

393
00:47:35,770 --> 00:47:39,105
You will be in my charge
until we reach the final destination.

394
00:47:39,524 --> 00:47:44,194
You have now 30 minutes for rest, relief,
and there is food and water for all.

395
00:47:44,987 --> 00:47:46,655
Major von Klement?

396
00:47:48,324 --> 00:47:50,534
Captain Oriani is an ltalian officer.

397
00:47:50,618 --> 00:47:52,327
He's not a prisoner of war.
He doesn't belong with us.

398
00:47:54,163 --> 00:47:56,540
- l have my orders.
- (soldier shouts in German)

399
00:48:35,913 --> 00:48:37,998
(train whistle)

400
00:48:57,602 --> 00:48:59,019
Heil Hitler.

401
00:49:14,035 --> 00:49:15,535
The guards are on top again.

402
00:49:16,621 --> 00:49:19,831
They're not needed here
as far as we're concerned.

403
00:49:20,833 --> 00:49:24,377
No chance of our tunnelling
through this coop, Von Ryan.

404
00:49:24,462 --> 00:49:25,837
(clanging)

405
00:49:30,635 --> 00:49:32,552
(clanging continues)

406
00:50:05,169 --> 00:50:07,420
Say, Doc, you got a knife
in that manicuring kit of yours?

407
00:50:30,361 --> 00:50:32,487
Are you planning
to snip your way through it?

408
00:50:32,947 --> 00:50:33,947
No.

409
00:50:34,573 --> 00:50:37,367
l'm planning to tunnel my way through it.

410
00:50:51,966 --> 00:50:53,717
Do you mind, Major?

411
00:51:09,400 --> 00:51:14,028
No, no, Colonel, wait. Wait until...
until the wheels hit cross tracks.

412
00:51:14,363 --> 00:51:16,948
lt will cover the sound
of the wood breaking.

413
00:52:11,045 --> 00:52:13,755
lt's impossible to get out
while we are moving.

414
00:52:13,839 --> 00:52:18,510
- And when we stop, the guards will patrol.
- lf it's dark when we stop, l'll risk it.

415
00:52:18,594 --> 00:52:23,389
- What about the rest? lf one goes, we all go.
- Do we, now? Mind telling me how?

416
00:52:23,474 --> 00:52:26,226
- We'll have to eliminate the guards.
- Brilliant!

417
00:52:26,310 --> 00:52:28,812
They have machine pistols
and we have bare hands.

418
00:52:46,080 --> 00:52:48,915
lf we could take one gun from one guard...

419
00:53:11,146 --> 00:53:12,355
Oriani?

420
00:53:13,691 --> 00:53:15,108
Turn around.

421
00:53:15,818 --> 00:53:17,819
Go on. Just turn around.

422
00:53:24,618 --> 00:53:26,786
Learn that from the cowboy films, did you?

423
00:53:29,707 --> 00:53:31,457
You got a better idea?

424
00:53:31,542 --> 00:53:35,044
lt would take you too long
to strangle a man, Colonel Ryan.

425
00:53:35,129 --> 00:53:38,965
The average Nazi would get impatient
while you were doing it.

426
00:53:39,258 --> 00:53:40,341
Orde.

427
00:53:48,434 --> 00:53:52,770
The knots smash his larynx, the knee
breaks his back. He's dead in 1 5 seconds.

428
00:53:52,855 --> 00:53:54,731
Thug garrotte - lndia.

429
00:53:54,899 --> 00:53:57,650
All right, then. Now what's your scheme?

430
00:54:10,831 --> 00:54:12,373
(train whistle)

431
00:54:15,628 --> 00:54:17,337
(shouts in ltalian)

432
00:55:59,857 --> 00:56:02,984
lf you haven't the guts for it, l'll do it.

433
00:56:30,387 --> 00:56:31,929
(train whistle)

434
00:56:55,871 --> 00:56:57,705
(train slows down)

435
00:57:03,003 --> 00:57:04,796
We're stopping again.

436
00:57:06,090 --> 00:57:08,257
Something must have gone wrong.

437
00:57:08,342 --> 00:57:11,385
- Perhaps they've been caught.
- Take it easy, Padre.

438
00:57:18,310 --> 00:57:20,186
(train slows to a halt)

439
00:57:21,188 --> 00:57:22,522
(ltalian)

440
00:57:26,360 --> 00:57:46,963
(German)

441
00:58:07,776 --> 00:58:09,569
- There's a station up ahead.
- Wait.

442
00:58:09,653 --> 00:58:12,822
- Someone might be watching.
- lt's a chance we'll take.

443
00:58:12,906 --> 00:58:15,241
The guards are on this side.
Open the door on that side.

444
00:58:15,450 --> 00:58:17,493
- What kind of insanity...
- Knock it off.

445
00:58:18,245 --> 00:58:21,038
- Get the men on the roof right away.
- Right, sir.

446
00:58:21,456 --> 00:58:24,000
lf you fail, the Germans
won't have to kill you. l will.

447
00:58:24,084 --> 00:58:25,334
Shut up.

448
00:58:38,056 --> 00:58:40,016
Shh. Shh.

449
00:58:41,852 --> 00:58:44,103
Bostick, you follow me with half the men.

450
00:58:44,188 --> 00:58:46,731
Dunbar, spread out with the rest.
Move. Quiet.

451
00:59:06,919 --> 00:59:08,586
(Germans chatting)

452
00:59:41,286 --> 00:59:43,329
(shouting in ltalian)

453
01:00:03,350 --> 01:00:05,184
Let's turn 'em loose.

454
01:00:07,187 --> 01:00:08,729
(train whistle)

455
01:00:18,657 --> 01:00:21,993
- Can we get moving?
- The engineer's alive but not the fireman.

456
01:00:22,077 --> 01:00:25,705
- l can stoke the boiler, sir.
- Get Oriani up with the engineer.

457
01:00:25,789 --> 01:00:30,251
- Send the chaplain and the doctor here.
- Yes, sir. Get those bodies in the boxcar!

458
01:00:30,335 --> 01:00:32,211
(Ryan) Get this stiff in the boxcar.

459
01:00:32,296 --> 01:00:34,255
Get those bods in quick!

460
01:00:41,763 --> 01:00:43,306
(train whistle)

461
01:00:52,065 --> 01:00:55,651
Get this train moving and you
won't get hurt. Understand?

462
01:00:57,404 --> 01:00:59,739
Move, you people! Come on, move!

463
01:01:02,576 --> 01:01:04,452
- (whistles)
- (ltalian)

464
01:01:23,430 --> 01:01:25,973
Ten more minutes... Of all the luck!

465
01:01:26,975 --> 01:01:29,685
He'll have to stop for water, same as we did.

466
01:01:29,770 --> 01:01:32,772
By the time he gets goin'
we'll be miles away.

467
01:01:43,533 --> 01:01:46,243
(Fincham) Damn thing's right behind us.

468
01:01:48,747 --> 01:01:50,664
Can you bring him around? We'll need him.

469
01:02:05,222 --> 01:02:06,430
(gasps)

470
01:02:11,269 --> 01:02:12,895
Come on. Come on!

471
01:02:19,903 --> 01:02:21,904
All the comforts of home.

472
01:02:21,988 --> 01:02:23,989
Please. l am ltalian.
l have done nothing. Please.

473
01:02:26,660 --> 01:02:28,369
What on earth are you doing here, my child?

474
01:02:28,829 --> 01:02:30,204
Padre, you're priceless.

475
01:02:33,166 --> 01:02:35,960
Don't you think she ought to
get dressed while we discuss it?

476
01:02:36,044 --> 01:02:39,130
He's right. Go on, girl. No one will hurt you.

477
01:02:41,466 --> 01:02:43,342
Now, about some questions, Major.

478
01:02:43,427 --> 01:02:45,428
- May l rise?
- Of course.

479
01:02:46,680 --> 01:02:49,390
l will answer no questions, Herr Oberst.

480
01:02:50,600 --> 01:02:54,979
Major... All your guards are dead.
We're running this train now.

481
01:02:55,439 --> 01:02:56,730
l want the schedule

482
01:02:56,815 --> 01:03:00,443
of when and where we're gonna get
that food you promised us. Clear?

483
01:03:07,576 --> 01:03:11,162
- Florence at 0600 hours.
- And what happens in Florence?

484
01:03:11,371 --> 01:03:15,291
The train will stop in the rail complex
and the prisoners can dismount.

485
01:03:15,375 --> 01:03:17,543
Colonel Ryan! Colonel, look!

486
01:03:22,215 --> 01:03:24,383
Looks like we're headed for lnnsbruck.

487
01:03:24,551 --> 01:03:26,594
What do these circles mean, Major?

488
01:03:26,678 --> 01:03:32,266
l am to receive instructions in those cities
from the dispatchers. l, myself. No one else.

489
01:03:32,684 --> 01:03:35,102
Did you receive those instructions
through that radio there?

490
01:03:35,937 --> 01:03:39,482
- No. lt is a simple commercial radio.
- All right. Over there.

491
01:03:39,566 --> 01:03:42,568
Lieutenant, if he wiggles, put a hole in him.

492
01:03:48,492 --> 01:03:50,034
(train whistle)

493
01:03:51,912 --> 01:03:56,457
- They're keeping pace with us.
- A German troop train is on this schedule.

494
01:03:56,541 --> 01:04:00,419
Gentlemen, you have been very daring.
Yet what have you gained?

495
01:04:00,879 --> 01:04:03,797
ln Florence, other troops are waiting.
You have been brave.

496
01:04:03,882 --> 01:04:05,132
lf you now wish to be sensible,

497
01:04:05,217 --> 01:04:08,260
l will see that you are treated with respect
in Florence.

498
01:04:08,595 --> 01:04:11,263
We had a sample of your Nazi respect
when we boarded this train.

499
01:04:12,140 --> 01:04:15,434
- Still, you have no choice.
- And nothing to lose by trying to make one.

500
01:04:16,394 --> 01:04:18,395
(reads in fluent German)

501
01:04:20,982 --> 01:04:25,986
Von Klement's identification papers and
railroad priority, good as far as Florence.

502
01:04:26,821 --> 01:04:30,115
- You do very well with German, Padre.
- l studied in Germany.

503
01:04:30,200 --> 01:04:32,451
l went to Breslau after Oxford.

504
01:04:32,536 --> 01:04:35,913
Would the dispatcher in Florence
recognise the major by sight?

505
01:04:35,997 --> 01:04:37,248
(laughs)

506
01:04:38,124 --> 01:04:42,169
- He'd be an ltalian, wouldn't he?
- Of course! Under German supervision.

507
01:04:42,254 --> 01:04:46,090
- And l think you're lying.
- l'd say, with the country in such a flap,

508
01:04:46,174 --> 01:04:50,844
the chances that the dispatcher
will ask for identification is pretty small.

509
01:04:50,929 --> 01:04:54,306
Will ask whom? l mean,
you just said just now...

510
01:04:56,184 --> 01:04:58,394
Yes. lt'll just have to be the chance we take.

511
01:04:58,478 --> 01:05:00,521
You are extremely foolish!

512
01:05:00,772 --> 01:05:03,899
- Quite right.
- Oh, no. But l...

513
01:05:04,859 --> 01:05:08,946
But... look at this picture!
l don't look remotely like this chap.

514
01:05:09,656 --> 01:05:11,615
No, no. l won't do it.

515
01:05:12,200 --> 01:05:14,326
l won't do it. Absolutely not.

516
01:05:15,161 --> 01:05:18,247
- Heil Hitler!
- That's better. Now let's see you walk.

517
01:05:18,331 --> 01:05:21,584
- lt won't work, you know.
- Yes, it will. Let's see you walk.

518
01:05:21,668 --> 01:05:25,045
Put some style into it. Hand on your hip.
The Boche have style.

519
01:05:25,130 --> 01:05:27,548
Slap your gloves against your leg.

520
01:05:27,632 --> 01:05:29,300
(speaks in German)

521
01:05:33,346 --> 01:05:34,722
(German)

522
01:05:35,557 --> 01:05:37,057
- Heil Hitler!
- Heil Hitler.

523
01:05:37,392 --> 01:05:38,892
Gut. Sehr gut.

524
01:05:39,519 --> 01:05:42,146
l think you had him goin' there, vicar.
You all set?

525
01:05:42,230 --> 01:05:44,940
Yes, sir.
l came over the tops of the cars to check.

526
01:05:45,025 --> 01:05:47,192
14 of our guys are stationed as guards.

527
01:05:47,277 --> 01:05:49,987
The rest of the uniforms were too bloody.

528
01:05:50,071 --> 01:05:51,488
Did you get rid of the bodies?

529
01:05:51,573 --> 01:05:54,491
While we were passing over the last bridge.

530
01:06:05,629 --> 01:06:07,171
(train whistle)

531
01:06:22,395 --> 01:06:23,437
(ltalian)

532
01:06:23,521 --> 01:06:26,774
Do what l tell you,
or l'll blow you apart!

533
01:07:09,109 --> 01:07:10,776
(shouts in German)

534
01:07:21,663 --> 01:07:23,414
(train approaching)

535
01:07:33,341 --> 01:07:34,466
(officer shouts in German)

536
01:07:38,805 --> 01:07:43,183
The lieutenant wants our men down
from the top of the train, to be fed first.

537
01:07:43,268 --> 01:07:46,186
lf they get down, we're dead.
They can't speak German.

538
01:07:46,271 --> 01:07:47,730
We've had it.

539
01:07:57,365 --> 01:07:59,533
Crikey! Ain't that our vicar?

540
01:07:59,617 --> 01:08:01,660
(officer shouts in German)

541
01:08:06,082 --> 01:08:07,332
(German)

542
01:08:07,417 --> 01:08:09,835
lt is customary to report first
to the commander.

543
01:08:10,211 --> 01:08:14,214
Lt. Gertel, sir... Field Mess 306.
The guards should be fed...

544
01:08:27,729 --> 01:08:28,937
(German)

545
01:08:29,022 --> 01:08:31,732
Have the first 1 6 prisoners take
full rations to the guards.

546
01:08:33,193 --> 01:08:34,693
They can't leave their posts.

547
01:08:38,031 --> 01:08:39,406
(German)

548
01:08:43,620 --> 01:08:45,579
(shouts order in German)

549
01:09:00,845 --> 01:09:02,930
Better check our lovebirds.

550
01:09:44,848 --> 01:09:46,390
(glass smashes)

551
01:09:49,936 --> 01:09:52,062
(man speaking in German)

552
01:09:58,862 --> 01:10:00,362
- Heil Hitler.
- Heil Hitler.

553
01:10:01,865 --> 01:10:05,200
(German)

554
01:10:05,285 --> 01:10:06,743
l am Major von Klement.

555
01:10:07,161 --> 01:10:08,537
My orders, please.

556
01:10:10,123 --> 01:10:12,291
May l see your identification
papers, Major?

557
01:10:19,883 --> 01:10:21,300
Button your tunic!

558
01:10:24,220 --> 01:10:26,305
You call yourself
a German officer?

559
01:10:26,723 --> 01:10:28,640
Your name, rank and
serial number!

560
01:10:29,100 --> 01:10:31,143
lf you can't hold this little post...

561
01:10:31,728 --> 01:10:34,897
...l'll have you transferred
to the Russian front!

562
01:10:38,026 --> 01:10:40,152
My orders! l'm in a hurry!

563
01:10:42,071 --> 01:10:43,322
(German)

564
01:10:49,370 --> 01:10:50,787
Heil Hitler!

565
01:10:52,165 --> 01:10:53,540
Heil Hitler.

566
01:10:55,585 --> 01:10:56,835
(German)

567
01:11:05,011 --> 01:11:06,762
Nazis...my God!

568
01:11:15,647 --> 01:11:19,358
- (Orde) Here they come!
- (Stein) My God, they've done it!

569
01:11:20,109 --> 01:11:23,695
Well done, Padre. You've done it.
My God, you've done it.

570
01:11:30,370 --> 01:11:33,538
Believe it or not, the poor devil's fainted.

571
01:12:04,237 --> 01:12:07,239
They must be moving
a couple of divisions south.

572
01:12:07,323 --> 01:12:10,158
From the map, we'll be away
from the main roads by dark.

573
01:12:10,243 --> 01:12:12,160
The men could be gone in ten minutes.

574
01:12:12,245 --> 01:12:15,872
How do we get ten minutes
with that troop train only five behind us?

575
01:12:15,957 --> 01:12:19,584
- lt could turn off at Bologna.
- Or follow us straight to Berlin.

576
01:12:19,669 --> 01:12:24,089
Escaped? We haven't escaped.
All we're doing is this bastard's job for him.

577
01:12:24,173 --> 01:12:30,303
Exactly. And in Verona, which is marked by
an X on the map, l will be properly grateful.

578
01:12:30,972 --> 01:12:35,225
At Verona, both the train crew and
guard detail is scheduled to be changed.

579
01:12:35,309 --> 01:12:37,352
That's if we go to Verona.

580
01:12:37,770 --> 01:12:39,104
Look here.

581
01:12:39,647 --> 01:12:42,274
Suppose, when we get to Bologna, we

582
01:12:43,443 --> 01:12:45,902
we could pass it and go
to the left into Milano.

583
01:12:45,987 --> 01:12:50,323
(laughs) And you go, hm?
Perhaps on American railroads, yes?

584
01:12:50,950 --> 01:12:54,953
But this train is under the orders
of the German high command.

585
01:12:55,329 --> 01:12:59,082
Such things are not possible.
To reroute a military train

586
01:12:59,167 --> 01:13:03,795
requires a written order signed by
a member of the general staff, Colonel.

587
01:13:04,797 --> 01:13:08,800
Major, yours is not the only army
that works in triplicate forms.

588
01:13:12,805 --> 01:13:16,266
Obergruppenführer Wilhelm von Kleist.

589
01:13:18,227 --> 01:13:21,063
- Does that mean general staff?
- lt does indeed.

590
01:13:21,147 --> 01:13:26,109
Well, now. We've got a pad full of
blank forms and we've got a typewriter.

591
01:13:27,487 --> 01:13:28,653
l say! Wizard!

592
01:13:28,738 --> 01:13:31,573
We can't be any worse off than we are now.

593
01:13:31,657 --> 01:13:32,824
Quite.

594
01:13:33,701 --> 01:13:37,245
Let's say we type an order to Klement here.

595
01:13:38,414 --> 01:13:41,374
Upon arriving in Bologna,
he's told to go to Milan,

596
01:13:41,459 --> 01:13:46,880
where he is given confidential
instructions from Gruppenführer...

597
01:13:46,964 --> 01:13:51,218
- Give me a good Aryan name.
- Um... Ottfried. Johann Heinrich.

598
01:13:52,011 --> 01:13:56,431
Gruppenführer Heinrich, who is in charge
of a trainload of sealed boxcars

599
01:13:56,516 --> 01:14:00,227
to be delivered to somebody...
big, important.

600
01:14:00,645 --> 01:14:03,438
- Fatso Goering.
- Der dicke Hermann. Brilliant!

601
01:14:03,648 --> 01:14:05,982
- Lootfor the Reichsmarschall.
- Major?

602
01:14:06,192 --> 01:14:09,694
lt might do. lt's got enough nerve -
l'll give you that.

603
01:14:10,363 --> 01:14:14,783
And we have it signed by our good friend
from general staff, Wilhelm von Kleist.

604
01:14:14,867 --> 01:14:17,077
(Costanzo says date in German)

605
01:14:25,711 --> 01:14:27,212
This will be very difficult, sir.

606
01:14:27,797 --> 01:14:28,880
Difficult?

607
01:14:29,340 --> 01:14:31,091
For our Fatso Hermann?

608
01:14:46,691 --> 01:14:49,693
For Fieldmarshal Goering,
of course!

609
01:14:49,777 --> 01:14:51,570
(arguing in ltalian)

610
01:14:55,491 --> 01:14:56,533
(speaks ltalian)

611
01:14:56,617 --> 01:14:58,577
Don't argue,
change the schedule!

612
01:14:59,579 --> 01:15:01,746
(heated argument in ltalian)

613
01:15:10,923 --> 01:15:14,217
- Amerikanisch, nicht?
- Ja.

614
01:15:14,302 --> 01:15:15,302
(German)

615
01:15:15,386 --> 01:15:18,972
This is an American pilot's watch.
How did you get it?

616
01:15:19,473 --> 01:15:21,933
Steal it? Buy it? Find it?

617
01:15:22,435 --> 01:15:26,605
l gave it to him for shooting
down the American plane.

618
01:15:31,152 --> 01:15:38,450
(German)

619
01:15:39,577 --> 01:15:42,329
Lt. General von Kleist
will be very pleased.

620
01:15:43,289 --> 01:15:45,916
Your name, Captain,
for my report.

621
01:15:46,250 --> 01:15:49,002
Hauptmann Joseph Sonneberg, Herr Major.

622
01:15:51,547 --> 01:15:53,089
Danke sehr.

623
01:15:53,382 --> 01:15:55,300
- Heil Hitler.
- Heil Hitler.

624
01:16:16,113 --> 01:16:18,198
Give this to the engineer.

625
01:16:18,699 --> 01:16:20,659
(Ryan whispers) Gestapo.

626
01:16:23,037 --> 01:16:27,999
- How long is it now?
- Ten minutes, and my pulse is up 1 2 points.

627
01:16:29,543 --> 01:16:30,877
(knocking)

628
01:16:33,881 --> 01:16:35,257
- How'd it go?
- Piece of cake.

629
01:16:37,343 --> 01:16:39,552
Leave it. Everybody stay low.

630
01:16:41,806 --> 01:16:44,015
Gestapo. Get those blinds up.

631
01:16:48,688 --> 01:16:49,938
Gestapo.

632
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:10,542
(speaks German)

633
01:17:11,377 --> 01:17:13,503
l'm busy. What do you want?

634
01:17:17,216 --> 01:18:06,765
(German)

635
01:18:09,310 --> 01:18:10,477
Nylon.

636
01:18:22,865 --> 01:18:24,115
(German)

637
01:18:35,961 --> 01:18:37,962
Amerikanische Zigaretten.

638
01:18:45,346 --> 01:18:46,388
Ja.

639
01:18:57,983 --> 01:19:01,069
That chap ought to be
reported to his superiors.

640
01:19:23,426 --> 01:19:25,677
That's the end of ruddy that.

641
01:19:27,012 --> 01:19:28,346
Colonnello.

642
01:19:30,266 --> 01:19:32,183
- We have found it.
- Found what?

643
01:19:32,476 --> 01:19:34,769
We have found a place to leave the train.

644
01:19:34,854 --> 01:19:37,522
An abandoned branch line
halfway to Milano.

645
01:19:37,606 --> 01:19:39,691
Come on. Let's have a look.

646
01:19:46,490 --> 01:19:48,241
Looks to be about

647
01:19:49,535 --> 01:19:50,910
90 miles.

648
01:19:52,496 --> 01:19:55,957
- We'll get there by 21 00 hours.
- Add half an hour, to stop for water.

649
01:19:56,041 --> 01:20:01,379
- That's better still. lt'll be good and dark.
- By morning, 90% of your men will be dead.

650
01:20:02,006 --> 01:20:05,800
We don't need him any more. Or her either.

651
01:20:06,385 --> 01:20:10,388
Don't flinch. lf you haven't
the stomach for it, it'll be my pleasure.

652
01:20:10,473 --> 01:20:12,599
- l'll decide that.
- Like with Battaglia?

653
01:20:12,683 --> 01:20:14,434
- That was different.
- l intend it to be.

654
01:20:14,518 --> 01:20:17,145
- You'll take your orders, Major!
- l'm afraid not.

655
01:20:17,229 --> 01:20:20,857
- For God's sake! These are people!
- People don't shoot wounded!

656
01:20:20,941 --> 01:20:24,819
But they do commit murder in cold blood?
Are you that far gone?

657
01:20:24,904 --> 01:20:27,197
May l go to my compartment now?

658
01:20:27,323 --> 01:20:28,865
Yes, of course.

659
01:20:45,633 --> 01:20:49,093
You haven't had any food
since we took over the train.

660
01:20:49,428 --> 01:20:53,431
- l'm not hungry.
- Of course you are. Here, take it. Relax.

661
01:20:57,770 --> 01:21:01,940
You cannot hide it. l know you will do
what the British major wants.

662
01:21:03,067 --> 01:21:04,859
You mean to kill you both?

663
01:21:04,944 --> 01:21:07,987
lt is the right thing.
ln your place, l would do it.

664
01:21:09,907 --> 01:21:11,491
No, you wouldn't. You're not that tough.

665
01:21:12,701 --> 01:21:15,119
- Then what do you want?
- Nothing.

666
01:21:17,039 --> 01:21:18,581
Not to help me?

667
01:21:20,584 --> 01:21:22,085
lf l can, yes.

668
01:21:23,587 --> 01:21:25,588
That is what all men say.

669
01:21:27,550 --> 01:21:28,591
How old are you?

670
01:21:29,385 --> 01:21:32,470
The first was the same man
who helped my mother.

671
01:21:33,764 --> 01:21:35,974
l was not yet confirmed then.

672
01:21:38,852 --> 01:21:41,062
Such things do not happen in America?

673
01:21:44,149 --> 01:21:49,237
- Why are you with this German?
- For food, for clothing. To stay alive.

674
01:21:50,489 --> 01:21:53,116
- ls that all?
- There is a war, you know.

675
01:21:54,660 --> 01:21:55,743
Yeah.

676
01:22:07,339 --> 01:22:09,090
How did you say it?

677
01:22:10,509 --> 01:22:11,676
Relax?

678
01:22:39,538 --> 01:22:41,873
You think my legs are too thin?

679
01:22:45,961 --> 01:22:47,503
Why don't you close the door?

680
01:22:51,634 --> 01:22:52,842
l will.

681
01:22:54,053 --> 01:22:55,595
On the way out.

682
01:23:06,732 --> 01:23:08,483
(crowd shouts abuse)

683
01:23:36,095 --> 01:23:37,428
German pigs!

684
01:23:45,396 --> 01:23:48,272
(soldier) We need water! We're hungry too!

685
01:23:48,732 --> 01:23:50,400
Knock it off in there!

686
01:23:50,484 --> 01:23:52,026
lf they knew what was going on,
they would.

687
01:23:52,111 --> 01:23:53,486
They'll just have to sweat it out.

688
01:24:46,331 --> 01:24:48,332
(shouts abuse in ltalian)

689
01:24:50,335 --> 01:24:52,962
What the hell are we waiting for now?

690
01:24:53,839 --> 01:24:55,173
(gunshots)

691
01:24:55,758 --> 01:24:57,008
Come on!

692
01:25:13,108 --> 01:25:15,401
They're gone. They're not here.

693
01:25:16,737 --> 01:25:18,237
He's dead.

694
01:25:22,743 --> 01:25:24,786
Back! Back! Get up on top!

695
01:25:25,454 --> 01:25:26,954
We can't leave them behind to talk.

696
01:25:27,039 --> 01:25:29,957
Cover that side. Work up toward the engine.

697
01:25:35,380 --> 01:25:38,132
- (speaks ltalian)
- (pulls whistle)

698
01:25:54,858 --> 01:25:56,359
(screaming)

699
01:25:59,196 --> 01:26:02,740
We must move now! lf the signal
turns red we'll be stuck here!

700
01:26:03,158 --> 01:26:04,951
l told you to wait!

701
01:26:05,077 --> 01:26:07,203
(engineer pulls whistle)

702
01:26:18,590 --> 01:26:19,882
Get back!

703
01:26:21,218 --> 01:26:23,094
All right. Let's move.

704
01:26:25,055 --> 01:26:27,348
Get this train moving now!

705
01:26:27,808 --> 01:26:29,183
Don't run away!

706
01:26:29,268 --> 01:26:31,394
l'm ltalian! Save me!

707
01:27:10,809 --> 01:27:13,978
Get your hands off me
or l'll blow your head off!

708
01:27:39,129 --> 01:27:40,671
(speaks German)

709
01:27:40,756 --> 01:27:42,214
(phone rings)

710
01:27:55,896 --> 01:27:57,897
A message from Bologna, sir.

711
01:27:59,691 --> 01:28:04,528
A convoy of prisoners is en route
to Austria, through Verona.

712
01:28:07,282 --> 01:28:08,574
(German)

713
01:28:08,659 --> 01:28:10,826
The commandant at
Bologna station, please.

714
01:28:14,164 --> 01:28:15,414
(German)

715
01:28:17,709 --> 01:28:20,419
The convoy of prisoners?
Yes...to Milan.

716
01:28:21,713 --> 01:28:25,841
Captain, it was done by order of
Lt. General von Kleist, himself.

717
01:28:26,343 --> 01:28:31,222
A shipment for Fieldmarshal
Goering? This is ridiculous!

718
01:28:33,725 --> 01:28:35,476
All right. l'll check it.

719
01:28:36,770 --> 01:28:37,770
lmpossible!

720
01:28:43,568 --> 01:28:44,610
(German)

721
01:28:44,695 --> 01:28:48,864
Bologna confirms your special
order to re-route the Milan train.

722
01:28:58,250 --> 01:29:00,292
A special order from me?

723
01:29:00,752 --> 01:29:03,796
Regarding the shipment to
Fieldmarshal Hermann Goering.

724
01:29:05,048 --> 01:29:08,759
l never gave any such order.
Which train did you say?

725
01:29:09,261 --> 01:29:10,970
A convoy of prisoners.

726
01:29:13,807 --> 01:29:16,225
The dispatcher's office
in Milan, please.

727
01:30:06,610 --> 01:30:09,487
These tracks have quite a shine
for not having been used.

728
01:30:09,571 --> 01:30:12,239
Something's been running on this spur.

729
01:30:20,749 --> 01:30:22,333
(speaks ltalian)

730
01:30:42,729 --> 01:30:47,775
These tracks have been used recently.
But we don't know what's ahead.

731
01:30:47,859 --> 01:30:50,319
lt's deserted here. Let's get cracking.

732
01:30:50,403 --> 01:30:54,031
- Last stop, Colonel?
- Last stop, soldier. Everybody out.

733
01:31:04,835 --> 01:31:06,544
All cars unload!

734
01:31:08,713 --> 01:31:10,464
(planes approaching)

735
01:31:14,094 --> 01:31:16,554
- Those are not German planes.
- American?

736
01:31:16,721 --> 01:31:19,098
No. British. Lancaster, l think.

737
01:31:20,267 --> 01:31:23,644
Sorry to turn you out in the middle
of nowhere, but it can't be helped.

738
01:31:23,728 --> 01:31:26,063
Now, head for the mountains or the sea.

739
01:31:26,148 --> 01:31:30,609
We'll form up again and have another crack
at Jerry. Off you go, lads. Good luck.

740
01:31:30,902 --> 01:31:32,319
(bombing)

741
01:31:39,244 --> 01:31:41,745
Everybody back on the train!
Back on the train!

742
01:31:44,583 --> 01:31:49,795
Get back! Get back on the train!

743
01:31:50,630 --> 01:31:52,506
Come on, move! Back! Get in!

744
01:31:52,591 --> 01:31:54,341
Come on, move! Back!

745
01:31:54,426 --> 01:31:55,593
Oriani!

746
01:31:56,261 --> 01:31:58,804
Take this train outta here!
Go! Go! Come on!

747
01:32:02,893 --> 01:32:05,936
You coward! You want
to leave these men to die?

748
01:32:06,563 --> 01:32:08,606
They're English...Americans...
our enemies!

749
01:32:09,149 --> 01:32:10,900
Are the Germans your friends?

750
01:32:11,109 --> 01:32:13,777
- Let the coward go!
- (ltalian)

751
01:32:38,470 --> 01:32:40,346
(shouts in ltalian)

752
01:33:11,753 --> 01:33:14,255
- Stop the train!
- (Oriani repeats order in ltalian)

753
01:33:32,691 --> 01:33:34,650
(shouting and screaming)

754
01:33:47,580 --> 01:33:49,623
Bostick! Bostick!

755
01:33:49,708 --> 01:33:54,128
- lnjured to the lounge car!
- Tell Oriani to cut the burning cars loose!

756
01:34:08,518 --> 01:34:10,978
- Where's Oriani? We're ready to roll.
- Roll? Roll where?

757
01:34:14,983 --> 01:34:17,651
Three dead, and the rest need better help
than l can give 'em.

758
01:34:17,736 --> 01:34:19,695
Maybe it's the end of the line.

759
01:34:20,363 --> 01:34:21,739
Colonnello.

760
01:34:22,866 --> 01:34:25,492
This man thinks he can get us through.

761
01:34:25,577 --> 01:34:29,330
- What are you talking about?
- Switzerland. The whole train. All of us.

762
01:34:29,414 --> 01:34:32,708
- Switzerland?
- You're mad. You're all raving mad.

763
01:34:33,668 --> 01:34:37,755
Here. North of Milano,
where the track forks.

764
01:34:38,089 --> 01:34:41,008
Since the war, all traffic
goes right, into Germany.

765
01:34:41,092 --> 01:34:44,887
But the left fork, the old Maloja Pass route,
goes to Switzerland.

766
01:34:44,971 --> 01:34:48,223
ln a matter of hours
we could be over the border and free.

767
01:34:48,308 --> 01:34:52,936
- You know, it's possible.
- Yeah, maybe, but... Milano - that's the key.

768
01:34:53,021 --> 01:34:57,274
- You think we can fool 'em again?
- The engineer says there is a way.

769
01:34:57,609 --> 01:35:02,529
On the outskirts of Milano is a control tower
at the beginning of the traffic complex.

770
01:35:02,614 --> 01:35:05,449
This tower controls the whole Milano area.

771
01:35:05,658 --> 01:35:10,245
lf we can capture it and smash the signals,
the main station, here,

772
01:35:10,330 --> 01:35:14,666
will not know where we are until
they repair it, but by then it will be too late.

773
01:35:14,834 --> 01:35:17,044
We can go through Milano
without stopping?

774
01:35:17,128 --> 01:35:19,797
Yes. The engineer says it can be done.

775
01:35:21,257 --> 01:35:22,633
Let's move.

776
01:35:54,874 --> 01:35:56,542
Snap to it!

777
01:35:59,212 --> 01:36:00,629
(whistle)

778
01:36:01,631 --> 01:36:06,677
(German)

779
01:37:31,596 --> 01:37:33,305
(Ryan whistles)

780
01:37:34,849 --> 01:37:36,683
Come on! Come on!

781
01:37:37,644 --> 01:37:38,936
Let's go!

782
01:37:51,783 --> 01:37:53,200
(speaks German)

783
01:37:59,332 --> 01:38:01,041
(speaks ltalian)

784
01:38:02,794 --> 01:38:05,462
ls it possible for the train
to by-pass Milan?

785
01:38:12,470 --> 01:38:15,806
No, sir, he says the train
has to go through this complex.

786
01:38:45,378 --> 01:38:47,004
(speaks ltalian)

787
01:38:47,839 --> 01:38:49,423
Soon we cross back into the complex.

788
01:38:49,507 --> 01:38:52,342
lf the power is back on,
we will show on the board.

789
01:38:52,427 --> 01:38:56,263
By then it will be full speed.
Too late for anyone to stop us.

790
01:39:04,606 --> 01:39:06,940
Get me a train for my troops!

791
01:39:12,905 --> 01:39:17,492
Col. Gorts here. Get me the
Luftwaffe Commander. Luftwaffe!

792
01:39:25,877 --> 01:39:28,378
(officer shouting orders in German)

793
01:39:31,341 --> 01:39:32,716
(German)

794
01:39:39,057 --> 01:39:40,724
(train whistle)

795
01:39:52,862 --> 01:39:57,532
- Can't this damn thing go any faster?
- Not before we reach the top of the pass.

796
01:39:57,617 --> 01:40:01,161
From there it's downgrade
all the way to Switzerland.

797
01:40:01,245 --> 01:40:04,790
Shouldn't we go a bit slower?
lf they've blocked the line ahead...

798
01:40:04,874 --> 01:40:08,752
- Keep it wide open. Let's move it.
- (speaks ltalian)

799
01:40:09,379 --> 01:40:10,462
Ryan.

800
01:40:11,881 --> 01:40:15,592
- Whether we make it or not...
- We're gonna make it, Major.

801
01:40:16,761 --> 01:40:20,889
What l'm trying to say is
l'm sorry it had to be you with the girl.

802
01:40:39,867 --> 01:40:41,952
(shouting in ltalian)

803
01:40:44,455 --> 01:40:46,456
(engineer pulls whistle)

804
01:40:46,582 --> 01:40:50,377
- Hey, mate, look! The Alps!
- We made it!

805
01:40:56,134 --> 01:41:01,304
Now that we're over the hump, sir, Major
Fincham, l figured you'd want your stuff too.

806
01:41:03,474 --> 01:41:05,142
Pepino! Pepino!

807
01:41:43,848 --> 01:42:03,033
(German)

808
01:42:35,650 --> 01:42:36,691
Messerschmitt!

809
01:42:49,747 --> 01:42:51,414
He's trying to blow the engine.

810
01:42:54,669 --> 01:42:55,836
Here comes his chum.

811
01:43:16,649 --> 01:43:17,649
There's another one!

812
01:44:43,861 --> 01:44:45,862
(fighter planes approach)

813
01:44:51,327 --> 01:44:53,036
(speaks ltalian)

814
01:44:55,373 --> 01:44:56,539
Oriani!

815
01:44:57,041 --> 01:44:58,959
(Fincham) OK, let's go.

816
01:45:01,128 --> 01:45:04,547
- (Ryan) What the hell's he saying?
- (speaks ltalian)

817
01:45:06,092 --> 01:45:09,260
That footbridge leads around the mountain!

818
01:45:09,887 --> 01:45:12,263
lt's shorter than the tunnel
to the other side.

819
01:45:12,348 --> 01:45:16,518
- Fincham, get them moving on the catwalk.
- Follow me! Everybody follow me!

820
01:45:29,907 --> 01:45:31,533
Move it! Move it!

821
01:45:48,759 --> 01:45:50,135
(cheering)

822
01:45:51,429 --> 01:45:55,390
- (Fincham) Come on, lads! Come on!
- Come on! Come on!

823
01:46:14,368 --> 01:46:17,287
All right. Back! Back to the trestle!

824
01:46:18,873 --> 01:46:19,956
Back!

825
01:46:29,133 --> 01:46:32,594
Looks like they're takin' off.
Let's see those glasses.

826
01:46:35,598 --> 01:46:38,475
No wonder they're takin' off. Let's go.

827
01:46:39,435 --> 01:46:41,186
(speaking ltalian)

828
01:46:47,651 --> 01:46:50,403
What about the German
troop train back there?

829
01:46:50,488 --> 01:46:52,530
- We have guns. We will stop them.
- Then what?

830
01:46:53,074 --> 01:46:57,035
- He says we can replace the damaged track.
- Replace it with what?

831
01:46:57,119 --> 01:47:00,872
lt's simple. Remove track
from behind the train - put it here.

832
01:47:00,956 --> 01:47:05,543
Well, then let's get the troop train!
All those with Schmeissers, follow me!

833
01:47:33,489 --> 01:47:35,698
Good! They've stopped the train!

834
01:47:39,036 --> 01:47:42,539
This one's much too long.
Take that one there. Hurry up.

835
01:47:44,875 --> 01:47:47,544
Clear this off! Clear this off! Hurry!

836
01:47:49,296 --> 01:47:50,672
Pull! Pull!

837
01:48:02,434 --> 01:48:04,394
- (ltalian)
- Come on, hurry!

838
01:48:20,995 --> 01:48:23,246
Come on, quick! That'll do it!

839
01:48:24,081 --> 01:48:25,331
Move it!

840
01:48:29,211 --> 01:48:30,420
Come on!

841
01:48:44,393 --> 01:48:46,102
(train approaching)

842
01:48:55,779 --> 01:48:58,698
(shouting in German)

843
01:49:18,552 --> 01:49:20,220
(shouts in German)

844
