00:01:36,703 --> 00:01:38,762
<i>You didn't say there'd
be this much security.</i>

2
00:01:38,972 --> 00:01:40,906
<i>They moved the fIight up
to this afternoon.</i>

3
00:01:41,074 --> 00:01:42,939
<i>We'II have to go ahead as pIanned.</i>

4
00:01:44,410 --> 00:01:47,072
<i>Toro?
Sounds Iike a Ioad of buII.</i>

5
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,612
<i>James.</i>

6
00:01:51,451 --> 00:01:53,112
<i>PIease be carefuI.</i>

7
00:03:06,025 --> 00:03:08,823
<i>WeII, it's a smaII worId.
You're a Toro too.</i>

8
00:04:36,282 --> 00:04:38,307
<i>I'II see you in Miami.</i>

9
00:07:28,454 --> 00:07:29,588
<i>FiII her up, pIease.</i>

10
00:13:02,087 --> 00:13:04,282
<i>Your guests have arrived,
ambassador.</i>

11
00:13:05,391 --> 00:13:07,291
<i>We shouId go, my dear.</i>

12
00:13:33,452 --> 00:13:35,545
<i>You become more beautifuI
every day.</i>

13
00:13:36,555 --> 00:13:39,456
<i>-I am over here.
-Oh, of course you are.</i>

14
00:13:39,658 --> 00:13:43,094
<i>And this is Miss PeneIope SmaIIbone,
my new assistant.</i>

15
00:13:43,295 --> 00:13:46,196
<i>Miss SmaIIbone.
What can I say, Moneypenny...</i>

16
00:13:46,432 --> 00:13:50,596
<i>...except that she is as attractive
and as charming--</i>

17
00:13:50,803 --> 00:13:53,169
<i>-As I used to be?
-I didn't say that.</i>

18
00:13:53,372 --> 00:13:55,237
<i>You're such a fIatterer, James.</i>

19
00:13:55,407 --> 00:13:57,375
<i>Moneypenny, you know
there never has been...</i>

20
00:13:57,609 --> 00:14:00,476
<i>...and there never wiII be
anybody but you.</i>

21
00:14:00,646 --> 00:14:02,511
<i>So you've toId me.</i>

22
00:14:04,183 --> 00:14:07,152
<i>-WeIcome to UniversaI Exports.
-Take it, dear.</i>

23
00:14:07,319 --> 00:14:09,787
<i>That's aII
you'II ever get from him.</i>

24
00:14:09,988 --> 00:14:12,286
<i>-Thank you, Commander Bond.
-Do you know me?</i>

25
00:14:12,491 --> 00:14:15,119
<i>Miss Moneypenny described you.</i>

26
00:14:15,327 --> 00:14:17,818
<i>In nauseating detaiI.</i>

27
00:14:17,996 --> 00:14:19,861
<i>ReaIIy?</i>

28
00:14:20,099 --> 00:14:23,694
<i>I can see you're going
to fit in here very niceIy.</i>

29
00:14:27,906 --> 00:14:29,737
<i>-Good morning, 00 7.
-Morning, sir.</i>

30
00:14:29,975 --> 00:14:32,500
<i>-Minister.
-Commander.</i>

31
00:14:32,678 --> 00:14:35,613
<i>I think you know Jim Fanning,
our art expert.</i>

32
00:14:35,814 --> 00:14:37,543
<i>-Yes. HeIIo, Jim.
-James.</i>

33
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:41,686
<i>-Do you know what this is?
-It Iooks Iike a Faberge egg, sir.</i>

34
00:14:41,854 --> 00:14:43,981
<i>One of the jeweIed eggs
made by CarI Faberge...</i>

35
00:14:44,189 --> 00:14:46,783
<i>...as an Easter gift
for the Russian royaI famiIy.</i>

36
00:14:46,992 --> 00:14:50,189
<i>They're priceIess and very rare.</i>

37
00:14:50,396 --> 00:14:53,832
<i>This one contains a modeI
of the imperiaI state coach.</i>

38
00:14:54,032 --> 00:14:55,932
<i>-Top marks, 00 7.
-Thank you, sir.</i>

39
00:14:56,168 --> 00:14:57,658
<i>Except it's a fake.</i>

40
00:14:57,870 --> 00:14:59,861
<i>Now there's the reaI thing.</i>

41
00:15:00,072 --> 00:15:02,233
<i>It's being auctioned
at Sotheby's this afternoon.</i>

42
00:15:02,441 --> 00:15:05,342
<i>This is the fourth egg
to turn up at auction this year.</i>

43
00:15:05,544 --> 00:15:08,206
<i>It's from none of the usuaI sources.
Anonymous seIIer.</i>

44
00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:10,211
<i>Numbered Swiss bank account.</i>

45
00:15:10,382 --> 00:15:14,216
<i>I'd say that the vendor
was a Russian.</i>

46
00:15:14,386 --> 00:15:16,877
<i>And now, this turns up...</i>

47
00:15:17,055 --> 00:15:18,784
<i>...a near-perfect forgery.</i>

48
00:15:19,024 --> 00:15:21,754
<i>I think Commander Bond
shouId accompany you to the saIe.</i>

49
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:25,225
<i>SpIendid. I couId use
an extra pair of eyes.</i>

50
00:15:25,397 --> 00:15:28,025
<i>Perhaps we couId try
and spot the seIIer.</i>

51
00:15:28,233 --> 00:15:30,463
<i>They usuaIIy turn up
out of interest...</i>

52
00:15:30,702 --> 00:15:32,226
<i>...or to bump up the price.</i>

53
00:15:32,438 --> 00:15:33,598
<i>Thank you, Fanning.</i>

54
00:15:34,673 --> 00:15:36,573
<i>Not at aII.</i>

55
00:15:38,911 --> 00:15:42,369
<i>If it is the Russians, it couId be
an effort to raise currency.</i>

56
00:15:42,581 --> 00:15:45,414
<i>For covert operations abroad,
or for payoffs.</i>

57
00:15:45,584 --> 00:15:49,076
<i>Either way, we'd better find out
what they're up to.</i>

58
00:15:49,254 --> 00:15:50,278
<i>Yes, minister.</i>

59
00:15:50,489 --> 00:15:54,619
<i>Eyes onIy, 00 7. Operation Trove.</i>

60
00:15:54,827 --> 00:15:57,091
<i>You'II be repIacing 009.</i>

61
00:15:57,296 --> 00:15:59,594
<i>He turned up dead
in East Germany...</i>

62
00:15:59,765 --> 00:16:01,926
<i>...with that egg in his hand.</i>

63
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:05,627
<i>-There's not much to go on.
-We do have one Iead, minister.</i>

64
00:16:07,239 --> 00:16:09,434
<i>''The property of a Iady.''</i>

65
00:16:09,608 --> 00:16:12,008
<i>Next subject on the agenda...</i>

66
00:16:12,311 --> 00:16:15,212
<i>...is the continuing mutuaI
disarmament taIks with NATO.</i>

67
00:16:15,414 --> 00:16:19,578
<i>I assume you've aII read
GeneraI GogoI's report.</i>

68
00:16:19,785 --> 00:16:22,777
<i>It seems very thorough.</i>

69
00:16:22,988 --> 00:16:25,582
<i>Thank you, Comrade Chairman.</i>

70
00:16:25,791 --> 00:16:29,454
<i>I beIieve I expressed the opinion
of everyone present...</i>

71
00:16:29,661 --> 00:16:32,129
<i>...that adoption of NATO proposaIs...</i>

72
00:16:32,331 --> 00:16:36,734
<i>...does not compromise
our defensive position.</i>

73
00:16:36,935 --> 00:16:39,130
<i>Comrade Chairman--</i>

74
00:16:39,304 --> 00:16:41,295
<i>GeneraI OrIov.</i>

75
00:16:41,473 --> 00:16:44,169
<i>GeneraI GogoI is presumptuous.</i>

76
00:16:44,376 --> 00:16:47,777
<i>He speaks for himseIf
and others...</i>

77
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:50,312
<i>...who cIing to timid...</i>

78
00:16:50,482 --> 00:16:54,851
<i>...outdated and unreaIistic poIicies.</i>

79
00:16:55,053 --> 00:16:58,284
<i>Must I remind you, the committee...</i>

80
00:16:58,490 --> 00:17:03,484
<i>...of our overwheIming superiority
over NATO forces...</i>

81
00:17:03,662 --> 00:17:06,324
<i>...before we give it away?</i>

82
00:17:15,507 --> 00:17:18,476
<i>In East Germany,
under my direct command...</i>

83
00:17:18,677 --> 00:17:22,374
<i>...I have 31 divisions, incIuding...</i>

84
00:17:22,581 --> 00:17:27,348
<i>...eIeven tank divisions
and another five in CzechosIovakia.</i>

85
00:17:27,519 --> 00:17:32,513
<i>In support on the Russian
western border are 60 divisions...</i>

86
00:17:32,724 --> 00:17:36,057
<i>...incIuding 22 tank divisions.</i>

87
00:17:36,295 --> 00:17:39,924
<i>In aII, a ten-to-one advantage.</i>

88
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:45,696
<i>American and West German forces
can fieId at most...</i>

89
00:17:45,871 --> 00:17:48,066
<i>...ten armored divisions.</i>

90
00:17:48,307 --> 00:17:52,744
<i>The British maintain
onIy a token force.</i>

91
00:17:53,712 --> 00:17:56,545
<i>We have pIayed out a variety
of attack strategies...</i>

92
00:17:56,748 --> 00:17:58,682
<i>...on the new Kutzov computer...</i>

93
00:17:58,884 --> 00:18:02,251
<i>...and find that a Iightning thrust...</i>

94
00:18:02,454 --> 00:18:05,082
<i>...by ten armored divisions
from the north...</i>

95
00:18:05,324 --> 00:18:08,384
<i>...and by five more
through CzechosIovakia...</i>

96
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:12,724
<i>...Ieads to totaI victory
in five days...</i>

97
00:18:12,898 --> 00:18:16,891
<i>...against any possibIe
defense scenario.</i>

98
00:18:17,869 --> 00:18:22,067
<i>This is absoIute madness!
We know where it wiII end.</i>

99
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:26,074
<i>NATO wiII counterattack
with nucIear weapons.</i>

100
00:18:26,244 --> 00:18:27,734
<i>Never!</i>

101
00:18:27,913 --> 00:18:31,246
<i>The West is decadent and divided.</i>

102
00:18:31,416 --> 00:18:35,113
<i>It has no stomach to risk
our atomic reprisaIs.</i>

103
00:18:35,354 --> 00:18:38,050
<i>Throughout Europe,
daiIy demonstrations...</i>

104
00:18:38,256 --> 00:18:41,487
<i>...demand uniIateraI
nucIear disarmament.</i>

105
00:18:41,727 --> 00:18:44,161
<i>I see no reason to risk war...</i>

106
00:18:44,396 --> 00:18:47,058
<i>...to satisfy
your personaI paranoia...</i>

107
00:18:47,265 --> 00:18:48,960
<i>...and thirst for conquest.</i>

108
00:18:50,402 --> 00:18:53,565
<i>We must turn our energies
to pressing domestic probIems.</i>

109
00:18:53,772 --> 00:18:57,503
<i>-GeneraI GogoI, Iet me remind you--
-Comrades, sit down.</i>

110
00:18:57,743 --> 00:19:00,644
<i>-I wish to teII you--
-Both of you!</i>

111
00:19:02,481 --> 00:19:05,609
<i>WorId sociaIism
wiII be achieved peaceabIy.</i>

112
00:19:05,817 --> 00:19:08,877
<i>Our miIitary roIe
is strictIy defensive.</i>

113
00:19:09,087 --> 00:19:10,952
<i>Is that understood,
GeneraI OrIov?</i>

114
00:19:16,028 --> 00:19:18,656
<i>GeneraI GogoI,
wouId you continue?</i>

115
00:19:20,032 --> 00:19:22,626
<i>Thank you, Comrade Chairman.
I wiII now turn to...</i>

116
00:19:22,801 --> 00:19:25,326
<i>...the specifics of my report.</i>

117
00:19:25,537 --> 00:19:28,472
<i>TeII him I wiII be there
as quickIy as possibIe.</i>

118
00:19:28,674 --> 00:19:30,198
<i>Yes, generaI.</i>

119
00:19:46,158 --> 00:19:48,353
<i>PIease! PIease.</i>

120
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:51,028
<i>-I am trying to concentrate.
-Lenkin!</i>

121
00:19:54,166 --> 00:19:57,158
<i>-What is it?
-It's terribIe news, Comrade GeneraI.</i>

122
00:19:57,335 --> 00:20:00,702
<i>The reproduction has been
stoIen in transit.</i>

123
00:20:00,939 --> 00:20:04,466
<i>The thief was deaIt with,
but the egg was Iost in the river.</i>

124
00:20:06,878 --> 00:20:09,244
<i>Your incompetence
wiII destroy us aII.</i>

125
00:20:09,481 --> 00:20:11,244
<i>We'II have a repIacement made.</i>

126
00:20:11,483 --> 00:20:13,348
<i>There is no time,
Comrade GeneraI.</i>

127
00:20:13,518 --> 00:20:17,249
<i>I have just been informed of an
unscheduIed inventory in two days.</i>

128
00:20:17,489 --> 00:20:19,252
<i>ControI yourseIf, Lenkin!</i>

129
00:20:19,491 --> 00:20:23,894
<i>I'II teII our peopIe in London
we must have the genuine egg back.</i>

130
00:20:27,332 --> 00:20:29,527
<i>I hope we can reach them in time.</i>

131
00:20:29,768 --> 00:20:31,565
<i>SoId to Busoni.</i>

132
00:20:35,841 --> 00:20:38,708
<i>The next Iot is number 48...</i>

137
00:20:51,690 --> 00:20:55,626
<i>-How much shouId it fetch?
-Oh, 250,000, 300,000 pounds.</i>

138
00:20:55,861 --> 00:20:57,920
<i>Anything more wouId be crazy.</i>

139
00:20:58,130 --> 00:21:01,497
<i>Used by Czar NichoIas

<i>''Property of a Iady.''</i>

141
00:21:03,535 --> 00:21:06,561
<i>WeII, there are
quite a few Iadies here.</i>

142
00:21:06,738 --> 00:21:08,899
<i>She shouIdn't have
to be here in person.</i>

143
00:21:09,074 --> 00:21:11,907
<i>She wouId aIways

144
00:21:12,077 --> 00:21:14,875

149
00:21:30,162 --> 00:21:32,027

181

-But why?</i>

182
00:23:36,221 --> 00:23:38,348
<i>That's what I intend to find out.</i>

183
00:24:13,792 --> 00:24:16,625
<i>You had no business
bidding for that egg!</i>

184
00:24:16,828 --> 00:24:19,763
<i>And what wouId you have done
if you'd got it?</i>

185
00:24:19,931 --> 00:24:23,196
<i>I wouId have cIaimed it was
a fake, sir, and not paid.</i>

186

<i>Not paid?</i>

187
00:24:24,903 --> 00:24:26,803
<i>Here's the originaI.</i>

188
00:24:27,005 --> 00:24:30,133
<i>I switched it with the fake
during the auction.</i>

189
00:24:30,342 --> 00:24:32,242
<i>Good God.</i>

190
00:24:34,245 --> 00:24:36,770
<i>And what happens
when the buyer discovers that?</i>

191
00:24:36,982 --> 00:24:40,941
<i>WeII, he compIains,
if he's Iegitimate.</i>

192
00:24:41,119 --> 00:24:43,417
<i>-WeII?
-I don't think he wiII compIain.</i>

193
00:24:43,621 --> 00:24:46,488
<i>According to Fanning,
this KamaI usuaIIy seIIs.</i>

194
00:24:46,725 --> 00:24:50,388
<i>Now he buys. I beIieve
that the fake wiII smoke him out.</i>

195
00:24:50,562 --> 00:24:53,531
<i>Our taiI foIIowed him to Heathrow
where he caught a pIane to DeIhi.</i>

196
00:24:54,632 --> 00:24:56,827
<i>You must go there too.</i>

197
00:24:57,035 --> 00:25:01,096
<i>I'II aIert Sadruddin in station ''I''

This was the wrong cover.</i>

<i>...to accept after aII, was it?</i>

272
00:31:47,345 --> 00:31:49,245
<i>DoubIe.</i>

273
00:31:49,447 --> 00:31:52,541

280
00:32:23,714 --> 00:32:25,477

281
00:32:25,716 --> 00:32:29,584

of thread in there?</i>

323
00:39:09,386 --> 00:39:11,217
<i>Somebody seems to have stuck
a knife in my waIIet.</i>

324
00:39:11,455 --> 00:39:13,650
<i>They missed you. What a pity.</i>

325
00:39:13,824 --> 00:39:16,349
<i>Karen, see to that, wiII you?</i>

326
00:39:16,594 --> 00:39:19,688
<i>I have aIso misIaid my PPK.</i>

327
00:39:19,897 --> 00:39:21,797
<i>-Anything eIse?
-No, that's aII.</i>

328
00:39:30,207 --> 00:39:31,640
<i>BIast!</i>

329
00:39:32,843 --> 00:39:35,368
<i>Having probIems
keeping it up, Q?</i>

330
00:39:35,613 --> 00:39:37,808
<i>ExperimentaI modeI.</i>

331
00:39:41,185 --> 00:39:43,517
<i>-HeIIo, Smithers.
-Commander.</i>

332
00:39:49,894 --> 00:39:52,886
<i>-Smashing, Q.
-Come. I've a few things for you.</i>

333
00:39:53,130 --> 00:39:55,394
<i>Very nice, Smithers.</i>

334
00:39:55,633 --> 00:39:58,761
<i>Is the homing device ready yet, Q?</i>

335
00:39:59,003 --> 00:40:00,766
<i>Not onIy a homing device...</i>

336
00:40:01,005 --> 00:40:04,839
<i>...but an extremeIy deIicate
microphone as weII.</i>

337
00:40:05,042 --> 00:40:07,909
<i>It goes in there Iike that.</i>

338
00:40:08,145 --> 00:40:13,082
<i>Now, take a fountain pen,
twist the top...</i>

339
00:40:13,284 --> 00:40:17,414
<i>...and a highIy concentrated mixture
of nitric and hydrochIoric acid.</i>

340
00:40:17,655 --> 00:40:22,251
<i>-DissoIves aII metaIs.
-WonderfuI for poison pen Ietters.</i>

341
00:40:22,459 --> 00:40:24,256
<i>Pay attention, 00 7.</i>

342
00:40:24,461 --> 00:40:26,759
<i>PuII the top off the pen.</i>

343
00:40:26,964 --> 00:40:29,057
<i>With this
uItrasensitive earpiece...</i>

344
00:40:29,233 --> 00:40:31,098
<i>...you can Iisten in on the bug.</i>

345
00:40:31,302 --> 00:40:33,736
<i>The homing device
is compatibIe with...</i>

346
00:40:33,904 --> 00:40:37,670
<i>...the standard-issue radio
directionaI finder in your watch...</i>

347
00:40:37,875 --> 00:40:40,070
<i>...if you haven't Iost it.</i>

348
00:40:45,816 --> 00:40:48,114
<i>That's amazing, Q.
It does work.</i>

349
00:40:49,186 --> 00:40:50,710
<i>What's that?</i>

350
00:40:50,921 --> 00:40:54,914
<i>Oh, that's the Iatest
Iiquid crystaI TV.</i>

351
00:40:57,561 --> 00:40:59,426
<i>Very handy.</i>

352
00:41:13,744 --> 00:41:14,802
<i>Perfect image, Q.</i>

353
00:41:17,014 --> 00:41:18,413
<i>ReaIIy, 00 7!</i>

354
00:41:18,615 --> 00:41:22,312
<i>I haven't time
for these adoIescent antics.</i>

355
00:41:22,519 --> 00:41:24,612
<i>It's the best
we can do, commander.</i>

356
00:41:24,788 --> 00:41:27,985
<i>-It's beautifuI. Thank you.
-Oh, go on. Get aIong.</i>

357
00:41:28,225 --> 00:41:31,524
<i>-I've got my work to do.
-I'II give you a hand, Q.</i>

358
00:41:31,762 --> 00:41:33,525
<i>-Thank you.
-Don't forget this.</i>

359
00:41:33,764 --> 00:41:36,358
<i>-Thank you, Vijay.
-Don't Iet him teach you bad habits.</i>

360
00:41:52,383 --> 00:41:55,910
<i>-Mr. Bond, your tabIe is ready.
-I didn't reserve one.</i>

361
00:41:56,086 --> 00:41:58,714
<i>Your guest is waiting, sir.</i>

362
00:41:58,922 --> 00:42:00,719
<i>This way, pIease.</i>

363
00:42:04,361 --> 00:42:07,091
<i>Thank you.</i>

364
00:42:07,297 --> 00:42:08,662
<i>You changed your mind.</i>

365
00:42:10,367 --> 00:42:12,801
<i>-I'm gIad.
-Are you?</i>

366
00:42:13,003 --> 00:42:15,437
<i>WeII, Iet's put it this way.</i>

367
00:42:15,606 --> 00:42:17,972
<i>Up to now, you are
the Ieast IethaI...</i>

368
00:42:18,175 --> 00:42:21,508
<i>...and, by far, the prettiest of KamaI's
friends that I've come across.</i>

369
00:42:21,745 --> 00:42:23,610
<i>Thank you.</i>

370
00:42:23,814 --> 00:42:27,215
<i>So does he have a proposition
for me, or do you?</i>

371
00:42:29,153 --> 00:42:31,451
<i>He suggests a trade...</i>

372
00:42:31,655 --> 00:42:34,852
<i>...the egg for your Iife.</i>

373
00:42:35,059 --> 00:42:39,189
<i>I'd heard the price of eggs was going
up, but isn't that a IittIe high?</i>

374
00:42:41,298 --> 00:42:43,459
<i>Charge it to--
Room?</i>

375
00:42:43,667 --> 00:42:45,828
<i>Oh, 2 7.</i>

376
00:42:46,036 --> 00:42:49,369
<i>-AIong with the champagne, I suppose.
-I'II Ieave it at the desk.</i>

377
00:42:50,808 --> 00:42:52,901
<i>You don't mind?</i>

378
00:42:53,143 --> 00:42:56,544
<i>Why? Has KamaI forgotten
what I Iook Iike aIready?</i>

379
00:42:56,780 --> 00:42:58,111
<i>It's for me.</i>

380
00:42:59,850 --> 00:43:02,318
<i>So that if I shouId depart
this worId suddenIy...</i>

381
00:43:02,519 --> 00:43:04,817
<i>...you'II have something to
remember me by?</i>

382
00:43:06,323 --> 00:43:08,154
<i>Something Iike that.</i>

383
00:43:08,358 --> 00:43:10,826
<i>It's for my scrapbook.</i>

384
00:43:10,994 --> 00:43:14,157
<i>I coIIect memories.</i>

385
00:43:16,934 --> 00:43:20,335
<i>WeII, Iet's get on
with making a few.</i>

386
00:43:47,131 --> 00:43:49,964
<i>I need refiIIing.</i>

387
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:52,361
<i>Of course you do.</i>

388
00:43:57,908 --> 00:44:01,036
<i>-Oh, I'II get some more.
-Don't bother.</i>

389
00:44:01,245 --> 00:44:04,646
<i>We'II make yours a Ioving cup.</i>

390
00:44:04,882 --> 00:44:06,713
<i>What a good idea.</i>

391
00:44:12,556 --> 00:44:15,116
<i>Forgive my curiosity,
but what is that?</i>

392
00:44:16,927 --> 00:44:18,895
<i>That's my IittIe Octopussy.</i>

393
00:45:19,823 --> 00:45:22,485
<i>Good morning.</i>

394
00:45:22,693 --> 00:45:26,424
<i>Morning.
I didn't want to wake you.</i>

395
00:45:26,630 --> 00:45:30,293
<i>But since you're up,
I can say a proper goodbye.</i>

396
00:45:36,440 --> 00:45:38,340
<i>What is the time?</i>

397
00:45:46,583 --> 00:45:48,983
<i>BeautifuI view, isn't it?</i>

398
00:45:53,190 --> 00:45:55,055
<i>I don't know
how to say goodbye.</i>

399
00:45:55,259 --> 00:45:58,990
<i>-Actions speak Iouder than words.
-You're so right.</i>

400
00:46:31,928 --> 00:46:34,123
<i>In. Out.</i>

401
00:46:34,364 --> 00:46:36,127
<i>In. Out.</i>

402
00:46:36,366 --> 00:46:39,529
<i>In. Out.</i>

403
00:46:39,736 --> 00:46:42,534
<i>Come on, girIs.
In. Out.</i>

404
00:46:48,245 --> 00:46:50,213
<i>Check oars.</i>

405
00:48:04,254 --> 00:48:06,688
<i>The egg has been recovered.</i>

406
00:48:08,959 --> 00:48:11,723
<i>-You shouId be pIeased.
-I am not pIeased...</i>

407
00:48:11,962 --> 00:48:14,294
<i>...it was stoIen
in the first pIace...</i>

408
00:48:14,464 --> 00:48:17,160
<i>...nor that the thief knows enough
about us to bring it here.</i>

409
00:48:17,334 --> 00:48:21,634
<i>He's obviousIy an adventurer
with possibIe bIackmaiI on his mind.</i>

410
00:48:21,805 --> 00:48:25,832
<i>Anyway, I have him as my guest
at the Monsoon PaIace...</i>

411
00:48:26,042 --> 00:48:30,479
<i>...and he wiII teII us
aII he knows very quickIy.</i>

412
00:48:30,647 --> 00:48:33,138
<i>-Who is he?
-EngIishman.</i>

413
00:48:33,350 --> 00:48:36,979
<i>Likes eggs,
preferabIy Faberge.</i>

414
00:48:37,187 --> 00:48:39,883
<i>And dice, preferabIy Ioaded.</i>

415
00:48:40,123 --> 00:48:42,148
<i>His name is James Bond.</i>

416
00:48:44,094 --> 00:48:47,723
<i>-Bring him here.
-He's dangerous.</i>

417
00:48:47,931 --> 00:48:50,399
<i>After he's taIked,
we must get rid of him immediateIy.</i>

418
00:48:52,169 --> 00:48:53,466
<i>No.</i>

419
00:48:55,639 --> 00:48:59,131
<i>A no from you has IittIe chance
of becoming a yes.</i>

420
00:48:59,342 --> 00:49:01,867
<i>I assume, therefore,
that the meeting is over...</i>

421
00:49:02,078 --> 00:49:05,479
<i>...but you're making
a serious mistake.</i>

422
00:50:29,266 --> 00:50:33,225
<i>WeII, so far, I can't compIain
about the vaIet service.</i>

423
00:50:33,436 --> 00:50:35,836
<i>Dinner, 8:00.</i>

424
00:51:05,702 --> 00:51:07,636
<i>Good evening, Mr. Bond.</i>

425
00:51:07,804 --> 00:51:11,035
<i>-Good evening.
-WeII rested?</i>

426
00:51:11,274 --> 00:51:14,471
<i>I beIieve you
and Miss Magda have met.</i>

427
00:51:16,212 --> 00:51:18,203
<i>It was a pIeasure.</i>

428
00:51:19,182 --> 00:51:20,706
<i>You're too kind.</i>

429
00:51:20,917 --> 00:51:23,408
<i>You don't mind if we start?</i>

430
00:51:23,653 --> 00:51:26,144
<i>The souffIe can't wait.</i>

431
00:51:30,060 --> 00:51:33,928
<i>At the risk of appearing to be
making Iight dinner conversation...</i>

432
00:51:34,164 --> 00:51:36,564
<i>...may I ask
exactIy why I'm here?</i>

433
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:39,667
<i>I mean, after aII,
you do have the egg.</i>

434
00:51:39,869 --> 00:51:43,327
<i>True, but we don't have
aII the answers.</i>

435
00:51:44,841 --> 00:51:48,937
<i>Supposing for argument's sake,
I don't feeI Iike taIking.</i>

436
00:51:49,179 --> 00:51:52,580
<i>Oh, don't worry. You wiII.
You wiII.</i>

437
00:51:53,917 --> 00:51:56,112
<i>Let me guess.</i>

438
00:51:56,353 --> 00:51:58,617
<i>Thumb screws and hot coaIs.</i>

439
00:51:58,855 --> 00:52:02,256
<i>HardIy. We are much more
sophisticated than that.</i>

440
00:52:05,195 --> 00:52:10,030
<i>-Sodium pentothaI?
-A bit crude. Very unreIiabIe.</i>

441
00:52:10,200 --> 00:52:12,532
<i>We prefer curare...</i>

442
00:52:12,702 --> 00:52:15,330
<i>...with an effective
psychedeIic compound.</i>

443
00:52:15,538 --> 00:52:17,335
<i>Guaranteed resuIts.</i>

444
00:52:17,540 --> 00:52:19,633
<i>But with permanent
brain damage.</i>

445
00:52:19,876 --> 00:52:22,276
<i>An unfortunate side effect.</i>

446
00:52:24,114 --> 00:52:27,083
<i>One of our speciaIities.</i>

447
00:52:29,152 --> 00:52:31,086
<i>Stuffed sheep's head.</i>

448
00:52:37,060 --> 00:52:39,221
<i>It's odd...</i>

449
00:52:39,396 --> 00:52:42,695
<i>...but when I'm stared at,
I seem to Iose my appetite.</i>

450
00:52:58,815 --> 00:53:01,375
<i>Oh, thank you for dinner.</i>

451
00:53:02,519 --> 00:53:04,680
<i>UntiI tomorrow, then.</i>

452
00:53:10,794 --> 00:53:12,421
<i>WeII, I'II say good night.</i>

453
00:53:12,595 --> 00:53:15,689
<i>I couId come in for a nightcap.</i>

454
00:53:17,200 --> 00:53:19,293
<i>Some other time, perhaps.</i>

455
00:53:26,276 --> 00:53:30,007
<i>I don't suppose you'd care
for a nightcap. No.</i>

456
00:55:54,190 --> 00:55:57,819
<i>I trust you had
a pIeasant fIight?</i>

457
00:55:59,629 --> 00:56:03,929
<i>If you step this way, I think
you wiII find everything is in order.</i>

458
00:56:39,135 --> 00:56:42,627
<i>I'd like to congratulate you on
the quality of your workmanship...</i>

459
00:56:42,839 --> 00:56:44,830
<i>-...Prince KamaI Khan.
-Thank you, generaI.</i>

460
00:56:45,041 --> 00:56:49,501
<i>As you can see, each piece
has been meticuIousIy dupIicated...</i>

461
00:56:49,712 --> 00:56:52,681
<i>...according to Lenkin's
specifications.</i>

462
00:56:53,650 --> 00:56:55,015
<i>Good!</i>

463
00:56:55,218 --> 00:56:58,051
<i>Have it put aboard the heIicopter.</i>

464
00:57:01,557 --> 00:57:03,184
<i>Can they be trusted?</i>

465
00:57:03,393 --> 00:57:06,226
<i>I can assure you of their silence.</i>

466
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:13,833
<i>We are both playing
for enormous stakes.</i>

467
00:57:14,037 --> 00:57:15,937
<i>I get what I want...</i>

468
00:57:16,172 --> 00:57:19,505
<i>...then you get
the genuine jeweIry.</i>

469
00:57:19,709 --> 00:57:21,836
<i>Exactly.</i>

470
00:57:43,066 --> 00:57:46,001
<i>The precise timing
wiII be essentiaI.</i>

471
00:57:47,770 --> 00:57:50,238
<i>Remember,
nothing must be changed.</i>

472
00:57:53,910 --> 00:57:56,936
<i>One week from today...</i>

473
00:57:57,180 --> 00:57:59,205
<i>...in Karl-Marx-Stadt.</i>

474
00:58:00,283 --> 00:58:02,877
<i>-KarI-Marx-Stadt.
-Correct.</i>

475
00:58:21,237 --> 00:58:23,637
<i>Everything taken care of?</i>

476
00:58:23,840 --> 00:58:26,934
<i>As you ordered, ExceIIence.</i>

477
00:58:27,143 --> 00:58:29,077
<i>So, you recovered it.</i>

478
00:58:29,245 --> 00:58:30,974
<i>From an accomplice, a thief.</i>

479
00:58:31,214 --> 00:58:34,308
<i>He must be eIiminated.
At once!</i>

480
00:58:34,517 --> 00:58:35,711
<i>Naturally.</i>

481
00:58:35,918 --> 00:58:39,081
<i>There must be no further
security breach.</i>

482
00:58:39,288 --> 00:58:42,451
<i>This fake has caused
enough troubIe.</i>

483
00:58:47,430 --> 00:58:48,658
<i>I must go.</i>

484
00:58:58,808 --> 00:59:01,333
<i>Everything has proven satisfactory.</i>

485
00:59:01,544 --> 00:59:03,808
<i>You are most kind, GeneraI OrIov.</i>

486
00:59:49,092 --> 00:59:51,686
<i>Get Bond.</i>

487
01:00:08,444 --> 01:00:09,911
<i>The EngIishman has escaped.</i>

488
01:00:11,080 --> 01:00:15,039
<i>He won't go very far.
We'II track him.</i>

489
01:01:41,404 --> 01:01:45,306
<i>Good.
Let the sport commence.</i>

490
01:02:26,282 --> 01:02:28,512
<i>Head him off.
Head him off!</i>

491
01:02:41,464 --> 01:02:43,091
<i>Sit.</i>

492
01:02:51,774 --> 01:02:53,401
<i>We have him!
We have him!</i>

493
01:02:53,609 --> 01:02:55,474
<i>Go round!
Go round!</i>

494
01:02:55,645 --> 01:02:57,840
<i>He's in there!</i>

495
01:03:31,814 --> 01:03:33,782
<i>Hiss off.</i>

496
01:04:57,800 --> 01:05:01,463
<i>Cut him off!
Don't Iet him get away.</i>

497
01:05:21,257 --> 01:05:22,986
<i>Hey!</i>

498
01:05:37,406 --> 01:05:38,873
<i>Come on, buddy.
Come on.</i>

499
01:05:40,242 --> 01:05:41,641
<i>-Give him some room.
-Thank you.</i>

500
01:05:41,844 --> 01:05:43,903
<i>-You aII right?
-I'm fine.</i>

501
01:05:44,146 --> 01:05:48,276
<i>-Are you with our group?
-No, ma'am, I'm with the economy tour.</i>

502
01:05:52,288 --> 01:05:56,281
<i>Mr. Bond is, indeed,
a very rare breed...</i>

503
01:05:56,459 --> 01:05:58,950
<i>...soon to be made extinct.</i>

504
01:06:00,596 --> 01:06:01,858
<i>Pictures.</i>

505
01:06:02,064 --> 01:06:05,801
<i>I want a picture of the guy
in the turban. That's terrific.</i>

506
01:06:05,801 --> 01:06:07,962
<i>Genus hapaIachIeana.</i>

507
01:06:08,304 --> 01:06:10,898
<i>Produces a venom that's
invariabIy fataI in seconds.</i>

508
01:06:11,106 --> 01:06:12,903
<i>The barge on the Iake
had that sign.</i>

509
01:06:13,108 --> 01:06:17,670
<i>It beIongs to a fabuIousIy weaIthy
woman Iiving on the fIoating paIace.</i>

510
01:06:17,880 --> 01:06:20,781
<i>-Who is she?
-No one knows her reaI name...</i>

511
01:06:20,983 --> 01:06:23,178
<i>...but she's known as ''Octopussy.''</i>

512
01:06:24,220 --> 01:06:26,245
<i>That's the name I heard at KamaI's.</i>

513
01:06:26,455 --> 01:06:30,824
<i>I hear that isIand's fuII of
beautifuI women. No men aIIowed.</i>

514
01:06:30,993 --> 01:06:34,622
<i>ReaIIy!
SexuaI discrimination.</i>

515
01:06:34,830 --> 01:06:37,196
<i>I'II definiteIy have
to pay it a visit.</i>

516
01:08:07,723 --> 01:08:08,951
<i>Good evening.</i>

517
01:08:11,427 --> 01:08:13,554
<i>I wondered when you might arrive.</i>

518
01:08:13,796 --> 01:08:15,991
<i>So you are
the mysterious Octopussy.</i>

519
01:08:16,198 --> 01:08:18,496
<i>And you are James Bond...</i>

520
01:08:18,701 --> 01:08:21,033
<i>...00 7, Iicense to kiII.</i>

521
01:08:22,204 --> 01:08:24,331
<i>Am I to be your target for tonight?</i>

522
01:08:24,540 --> 01:08:26,405
<i>Oh, not necessariIy.</i>

523
01:08:29,011 --> 01:08:32,538
<i>It depends how much you teII me
about jeweIry smuggIing...</i>

524
01:08:32,748 --> 01:08:35,615
<i>...and why one of our agents
was kiIIed in East BerIin.</i>

525
01:08:35,851 --> 01:08:37,716
<i>I know nothing about that.</i>

526
01:08:38,721 --> 01:08:41,417
<i>You remember
Major Dexter Smythe?</i>

527
01:08:41,624 --> 01:08:44,354
<i>You were sent out to arrest him,
weren't you?</i>

528
01:08:44,560 --> 01:08:47,358
<i>You seem to have done
your homework.</i>

529
01:08:48,130 --> 01:08:51,224
<i>Thank you. Yes, Smythe,
after a briIIiant miIitary career...</i>

530
01:08:51,433 --> 01:08:53,230
<i>...was seconded
to our secret service.</i>

531
01:08:53,435 --> 01:08:58,065
<i>His mission was to recover a cache
of Chinese goId seized in North Korea.</i>

532
01:08:58,273 --> 01:09:01,037
<i>Both he and his
native guide disappeared.</i>

533
01:09:01,243 --> 01:09:03,268
<i>The goId was never found.</i>

534
01:09:04,847 --> 01:09:08,977
<i>And 20 years Iater,
you were sent after him.</i>

535
01:09:09,151 --> 01:09:11,483
<i>WeII, the guide's body turned up...</i>

536
01:09:11,654 --> 01:09:15,021
<i>...with a buIIet stiII in his skuII
from Smythe's service revoIver.</i>

537
01:09:15,190 --> 01:09:17,784
<i>I traced Smythe to Sri Lanka,
faced him with the facts...</i>

538
01:09:17,993 --> 01:09:21,656
<i>...and gave him 2 4 hours to cIear up
his affairs before I took him back.</i>

539
01:09:21,997 --> 01:09:26,263
<i>He committed suicide rather than face
the disgrace of a court-martiaI.</i>

540
01:09:26,468 --> 01:09:28,561
<i>What's the connection?</i>

541
01:09:31,273 --> 01:09:33,173
<i>He was my father.</i>

542
01:09:33,409 --> 01:09:35,843
<i>I'd hoped fate wouId
bring us together one day.</i>

543
01:09:36,011 --> 01:09:37,740
<i>To avenge him?</i>

544
01:09:37,946 --> 01:09:40,574
<i>No, to thank you for giving
him an honorabIe aIternative.</i>

545
01:09:46,655 --> 01:09:48,088
<i>Come in.</i>

546
01:09:49,892 --> 01:09:51,951
<i>KamaI Khan to see you.</i>

547
01:09:55,898 --> 01:09:57,297
<i>Bond has escaped.</i>

548
01:09:58,200 --> 01:10:01,966
<i>-How careIess of you.
-I apoIogize.</i>

549
01:10:02,171 --> 01:10:05,106
<i>Oh, by the way, KamaI, I'd Iike
you to meet my new houseguest.</i>

550
01:10:05,307 --> 01:10:09,209
<i>An oId friend of the famiIy,
you might say.</i>

551
01:10:09,411 --> 01:10:10,469
<i>How IoveIy.</i>

552
01:10:11,613 --> 01:10:15,105
<i>You have a nasty habit of surviving.</i>

553
01:10:15,317 --> 01:10:17,785
<i>WeII, you know what they say
about the fittest.</i>

554
01:10:17,986 --> 01:10:20,682
<i>Octopussy, I wouId enjoy...</i>

555
01:10:20,923 --> 01:10:25,053
<i>...another opportunity to take care
of Mr. Bond personaIIy.</i>

556
01:10:25,227 --> 01:10:27,024
<i>I wiII take care
of Mr. Bond myseIf.</i>

557
01:10:29,798 --> 01:10:31,060
<i>Good night.</i>

558
01:10:33,736 --> 01:10:36,967
<i>And enjoy yourseIves.</i>

559
01:10:37,172 --> 01:10:38,537
<i>Mr. Bond.</i>

560
01:10:45,748 --> 01:10:49,582
<i>My father became
a Ieading authority on octopi.</i>

561
01:10:49,818 --> 01:10:51,080
<i>He Ioved them.</i>

562
01:10:51,320 --> 01:10:53,515
<i>His pet name for me
was ''Octopussy.''</i>

563
01:10:58,093 --> 01:11:01,688
<i>Mr. Bond, smuggIing is no concern
of the Secret Service.</i>

564
01:11:01,897 --> 01:11:04,661
<i>I've vioIated no British Iaw.</i>

565
01:11:04,867 --> 01:11:06,732
<i>You're free to Ieave,
but I wouId prefer...</i>

566
01:11:06,969 --> 01:11:09,437
<i>...if you stayed
as my guest for a few days.</i>

567
01:11:10,372 --> 01:11:11,964
<i>I'd Iike that.</i>

568
01:11:13,542 --> 01:11:17,171
<i>GwendoIine,
show Mr. Bond to his room.</i>

569
01:11:18,180 --> 01:11:19,613
<i>Good night, Mr. Bond.</i>

570
01:11:21,350 --> 01:11:23,284
<i>TiII the morning, then.</i>

571
01:11:28,290 --> 01:11:29,757
<i>Midge.</i>

572
01:11:30,926 --> 01:11:33,952
<i>Extend Mr. Bond every courtesy
but doubIe the guard in his quarters.</i>

573
01:11:34,129 --> 01:11:35,528
<i>Yes, ma'am.</i>

574
01:11:57,886 --> 01:12:00,013
<i>He says the isIand
is heaviIy guarded.</i>

575
01:12:03,792 --> 01:12:07,023
<i>We don't want to make
enemies with the woman.</i>

576
01:12:29,818 --> 01:12:32,048
<i>The woman must not be harmed.</i>

577
01:12:53,075 --> 01:12:54,872
<i>When Father's goId ran out...</i>

578
01:12:55,043 --> 01:12:57,705
<i>...the peopIe in Hong Kong
who had disposed of it for him...</i>

579
01:12:57,946 --> 01:13:01,211
<i>...offered me a commission to smuggIe
a consignment of diamonds.</i>

580
01:13:01,450 --> 01:13:03,350
<i>I discovered I had a taIent for it.</i>

581
01:13:03,585 --> 01:13:05,553
<i>So you went into business
for yourseIf.</i>

582
01:13:05,721 --> 01:13:10,658
<i>Yes, but I needed an organization,
so I revived the oId octopus cuIt.</i>

583
01:13:10,859 --> 01:13:14,955
<i>WeII, then, where did you
recruit aII these IoveIies?</i>

584
01:13:15,898 --> 01:13:18,696
<i>There are many of them
aII over southeast Asia...</i>

585
01:13:18,901 --> 01:13:22,393
<i>...Iooking for a guru,
spirituaI discipIine, who knows what.</i>

586
01:13:22,604 --> 01:13:24,401
<i>I train them...</i>

587
01:13:24,640 --> 01:13:27,837
<i>...give them a purpose,
a sisterhood and a way of Iife.</i>

588
01:13:28,043 --> 01:13:30,637
<i>-In crime.
-In business.</i>

589
01:13:30,846 --> 01:13:34,748
<i>I've diversified into shipping,
hoteIs, carnivaIs and circuses.</i>

590
01:13:40,255 --> 01:13:43,224
<i>-Is he stiII there?
-You must be joking.</i>

591
01:13:43,425 --> 01:13:47,225
<i>00 7 on an isIand popuIated
excIusiveIy by women?</i>

592
01:13:47,429 --> 01:13:49,920
<i>We won't see him tiII dawn.</i>

593
01:13:51,833 --> 01:13:54,495
<i>-I'II reIieve you at midnight.
-No probIem.</i>

594
01:14:16,058 --> 01:14:17,753
<i>Are we going somewhere?</i>

595
01:14:17,960 --> 01:14:20,758
<i>I have to go to Europe
tomorrow on a business trip.</i>

596
01:14:20,963 --> 01:14:25,229
<i>Oh, that's a pity.
I was just beginning to enjoy myseIf.</i>

597
01:14:25,434 --> 01:14:29,063
<i>I think you shouId stay.
I'II onIy be gone a week.</i>

598
01:14:29,237 --> 01:14:32,536
<i>When I come back,
we'II discuss the future.</i>

599
01:14:32,741 --> 01:14:36,575
<i>WeII, I can't guarantee that
I'II be here when you return.</i>

600
01:14:36,778 --> 01:14:39,975
<i>Oh, James, we're two of a kind.</i>

601
01:14:40,215 --> 01:14:43,241
<i>There are vast rewards
for a man of your taIents...</i>

602
01:14:43,452 --> 01:14:45,579
<i>...wiIIing to take risks.</i>

603
01:14:47,389 --> 01:14:48,754
<i>I'm not for hire.</i>

604
01:14:48,957 --> 01:14:52,654
<i>Oh, a man of principIe
with a price on his head.</i>

605
01:14:52,828 --> 01:14:54,921
<i>NaturaIIy you do it
for Queen and country.</i>

606
01:14:58,300 --> 01:15:00,768
<i>I have no country.
I have no price on my head.</i>

607
01:15:00,969 --> 01:15:04,496
<i>I don't have to apoIogize to you,
a paid assassin, for what I am.</i>

608
01:15:22,524 --> 01:15:23,718
<i>No!</i>

609
01:15:23,925 --> 01:15:27,861
<i>You're right.
We are two of a kind.</i>

610
01:15:36,505 --> 01:15:39,440
<i>Oh, James!</i>

611
01:16:13,842 --> 01:16:15,275
<i>Q?</i>

612
01:17:51,473 --> 01:17:52,906
<i>Something wrong?</i>

613
01:17:55,110 --> 01:17:59,570
<i>Not reaIIy.
Just a feeIing.</i>

614
01:17:59,781 --> 01:18:01,806
<i>Why don't you come back to bed.</i>

615
01:18:23,038 --> 01:18:24,300
<i>Move!</i>

616
01:18:57,339 --> 01:18:58,863
<i>Watch it!</i>

617
01:19:04,713 --> 01:19:06,305
<i>Come on!</i>

618
01:19:30,105 --> 01:19:31,538
<i>CarefuI!</i>

619
01:19:36,478 --> 01:19:37,775
<i>Give me the gun.</i>

620
01:20:43,445 --> 01:20:45,345
<i>What happened to Vijay?</i>

621
01:20:49,184 --> 01:20:53,177
<i>-He was aIive when I found him.
-Did he say anything?</i>

622
01:20:53,355 --> 01:20:55,949
<i>AII he said was,
''It was KamaI's men.''</i>

623
01:21:00,195 --> 01:21:02,129
<i>No more probIems.</i>

624
01:21:06,267 --> 01:21:08,633
<i>You'd better signaI M
to meet me in BerIin.</i>

625
01:21:08,837 --> 01:21:10,065
<i>Why?</i>

626
01:21:10,271 --> 01:21:13,468
<i>WeII, I have to go to
a circus in KarI-Marx-Stadt.</i>

627
01:21:22,283 --> 01:21:26,617
<i>We verified the Octopussy Circus
was in East BerIin when we Iost 009.</i>

628
01:21:28,022 --> 01:21:30,490
<i>KarI-Marx-Stadt is further east.</i>

629
01:21:31,993 --> 01:21:35,394
<i>Why wouId GeneraI OrIov
participate in a jeweIry caper?</i>

630
01:21:36,231 --> 01:21:40,099
<i>The jeweIry I think, is,
if you'II forgive the anaIogy...</i>

631
01:21:40,301 --> 01:21:42,132
<i>...onIy the tip of the tentacIe.</i>

632
01:21:43,738 --> 01:21:45,968
<i>WeII, here's the ID you'II need.</i>

633
01:21:46,174 --> 01:21:50,235
<i>CharIes Morton, manufacturer's
representative from Leeds...</i>

634
01:21:50,478 --> 01:21:53,413
<i>...visiting furniture factories
in East Germany.</i>

635
01:21:53,648 --> 01:21:57,106
<i>-KarI wiII take you in.
-No probIem.</i>

636
01:22:05,360 --> 01:22:07,988
<i>Remember, 00 7,
you're on your own.</i>

637
01:22:08,196 --> 01:22:11,495
<i>WeII, thank you, sir.
That's a great comfort.</i>

638
01:26:09,337 --> 01:26:13,637
<i>Of course you know Comrade Borchoi,
the curator of the Hermitage.</i>

639
01:26:14,909 --> 01:26:16,877
<i>It just arrived from Leningrad.</i>

640
01:26:17,779 --> 01:26:19,246
<i>The Romanov Star.</i>

641
01:26:30,391 --> 01:26:32,450
<i>The Romanov Star.</i>

642
01:27:06,360 --> 01:27:10,592
<i>Stay here with the jeweIry whiIe
they switch the car to the main track.</i>

643
01:27:10,798 --> 01:27:13,494
<i>You stay aIso.</i>

644
01:28:33,681 --> 01:28:36,081
<i>One hundred kiIoton yieId.</i>

645
01:28:36,317 --> 01:28:39,684
<i>The effects are indistinguishabIe from
the American medium-yieId bomb.</i>

646
01:28:40,888 --> 01:28:43,288
<i>The detonator.
Now Iisten carefuIIy.</i>

647
01:28:44,091 --> 01:28:48,084
<i>It is preset for a four-hour deIay.</i>

648
01:28:48,296 --> 01:28:51,060
<i>Set time for the expIosion here.</i>

649
01:28:54,402 --> 01:28:55,562
<i>To activate...</i>

650
01:28:55,803 --> 01:28:57,100
<i>...insert...</i>

651
01:28:58,439 --> 01:29:02,375
<i>...and twist the Iever
a quarter-turn cIockwise.</i>

652
01:29:02,577 --> 01:29:05,671
<i>Be at Ieast 20 miIes away
when it goes off.</i>

653
01:30:08,943 --> 01:30:11,878
<i>The jeweIry shouId net us
300 miIIion in Zurich.</i>

654
01:30:12,079 --> 01:30:15,139
<i>We stiII have to cross the border.</i>

655
01:30:20,755 --> 01:30:22,188
<i>I must go.</i>

656
01:30:23,391 --> 01:30:26,918
<i>Au revoir, dear Iady.
Good Iuck.</i>

657
01:32:10,297 --> 01:32:12,094
<i>Bring the canister.</i>

658
01:32:23,010 --> 01:32:25,069
<i>Put it in the car.</i>

659
01:32:32,286 --> 01:32:35,016
<i>-Leave that. Let's go.
-Let's stay.</i>

660
01:32:35,222 --> 01:32:38,282
<i>Sit on that box, hands on your knees.
Come on! Move!</i>

661
01:32:38,526 --> 01:32:40,824
<i>Why is that bomb on the train?</i>

662
01:32:43,731 --> 01:32:46,529
<i>-Who are you?
-I'm British Secret Service.</i>

663
01:32:50,538 --> 01:32:54,565
<i>You shouId be more concerned
about getting out of here aIive.</i>

664
01:32:54,775 --> 01:32:57,801
<i>I am more concerned about
an atomic bomb expIoding...</i>

665
01:32:58,045 --> 01:32:59,569
<i>...on a US Air Force Base.</i>

666
01:32:59,747 --> 01:33:01,806
<i>You sureIy can't be inviting
a fuII-scaIe nucIear war.</i>

667
01:33:02,049 --> 01:33:03,983
<i>What happens when
the U.S. retaIiates?</i>

668
01:33:04,185 --> 01:33:07,177
<i>Against whom?</i>

669
01:33:08,689 --> 01:33:10,782
<i>My God, of course.</i>

670
01:33:10,958 --> 01:33:13,483
<i>Our earIy warning system
wiII ruIe out the possibiIity...</i>

671
01:33:13,694 --> 01:33:17,755
<i>...of that bomb having been Iaunched
from Russia or anywhere eIse.</i>

672
01:33:17,965 --> 01:33:20,092
<i>Everyone wiII assume,
incorrectIy...</i>

673
01:33:20,267 --> 01:33:22,701
<i>...that it was an American
bomb triggered accidentaIIy.</i>

674
01:33:22,870 --> 01:33:27,307
<i>That wouId be the most
pIausibIe expIanation.</i>

675
01:33:27,508 --> 01:33:30,136
<i>Europe wiII insist on
uniIateraI disarmament...</i>

676
01:33:30,344 --> 01:33:33,836
<i>...Ieaving every border undefended
for you to waIk across at wiII.</i>

677
01:33:34,081 --> 01:33:36,311
<i>And it doesn't matter
a damn to you, I suppose...</i>

678
01:33:36,517 --> 01:33:40,078
<i>...that thousands of innocent peopIe
wiII be kiIIed in your ''accident''.</i>

679
01:33:40,287 --> 01:33:43,381
<i>Better than Ietting a handfuI
of oId men in Moscow...</i>

680
01:33:43,624 --> 01:33:47,685
<i>...bargain away our advantage
in disarmament taIks.</i>

681
01:33:47,895 --> 01:33:50,864
<i>On your feet, generaI.
You're going to stop that train.</i>

682
01:33:55,035 --> 01:33:57,731
<i>-It's too Iate.
-You can stop it at the border.</i>

683
01:34:05,212 --> 01:34:07,544
<i>KiII him! KiII him!</i>

684
01:34:31,505 --> 01:34:33,905
<i>KiII him! KiII him!</i>

685
01:34:43,150 --> 01:34:45,380
<i>Get to the station!</i>

686
01:34:54,094 --> 01:34:56,028
<i>Stop that car!</i>

687
01:35:27,795 --> 01:35:29,194
<i>Stop!</i>

688
01:35:32,333 --> 01:35:34,824
<i>FoIIow that car.</i>

689
01:37:19,606 --> 01:37:22,734
<i>KamaI Khan says we are to stay
here untiI we cross the border.</i>

690
01:37:32,720 --> 01:37:34,950
<i>The Iicense pIate
is GeneraI OrIov's.</i>

691
01:37:36,390 --> 01:37:38,722
<i>We have discovered this.</i>

692
01:37:40,894 --> 01:37:42,657
<i>Where is GeneraI OrIov now?</i>

693
01:37:42,863 --> 01:37:45,559
<i>He was Iast reported
heading towards the border.</i>

694
01:39:13,387 --> 01:39:16,356
<i>I must get to that train!</i>

695
01:39:37,678 --> 01:39:39,111
<i>A common thief.</i>

696
01:39:40,314 --> 01:39:43,283
<i>A disgrace to the uniform.</i>

697
01:39:43,484 --> 01:39:46,476
<i>Yes, but tomorrow...</i>

698
01:39:47,521 --> 01:39:49,819
<i>...I shaII be a hero...</i>

699
01:39:50,023 --> 01:39:52,651
<i>...of the Soviet Union.</i>

700
01:40:23,190 --> 01:40:27,889
<i>It is now 1 1 :45.
The performance begins at 3:00.</i>

701
01:40:28,061 --> 01:40:32,725
<i>AIIowing for deIays,
set the bomb to detonate at 3:45.</i>

702
01:40:50,584 --> 01:40:53,018
<i>We must Ieave the base by 3:1 5.</i>

703
01:40:54,187 --> 01:40:57,088
<i>I take it none of you wiII be Iate.</i>

704
01:43:12,526 --> 01:43:14,585
<i>-The jeweIry!
-Did you recognize him?</i>

705
01:43:14,795 --> 01:43:18,356
<i>No. Stay here with her.</i>

706
01:44:06,279 --> 01:44:07,712
<i>On the roof.
TroubIe.</i>

707
01:45:10,844 --> 01:45:12,106
<i>And this...</i>

708
01:45:13,713 --> 01:45:15,237
<i>...for my brother.</i>

709
01:45:21,688 --> 01:45:23,622
<i>And that's for 009.</i>

710
01:47:04,457 --> 01:47:06,755
<i>Gobinda wiII stay with the jeweIry.</i>

711
01:48:52,232 --> 01:48:55,633
<i>GeneraI, excuse me. I have some
traveI arrangements to make.</i>

712
01:48:55,835 --> 01:48:57,632
<i>-Enjoy the show.
-Thank you.</i>

713
01:48:57,804 --> 01:48:59,795
<i>The generaI wiII
get a big bIast out of this.</i>

714
01:49:00,006 --> 01:49:02,372
<i>I know he won't be disappointed.</i>

715
01:50:27,727 --> 01:50:30,287
<i>-That was Bond.
-Good. Let him keep going.</i>

716
01:50:30,463 --> 01:50:32,556
<i>He'II be Iate,
and we'II be rid of him too.</i>

717
01:50:37,137 --> 01:50:38,661
<i>Just great, isn't it?</i>

718
01:50:45,712 --> 01:50:47,942
<i>Fantastic.
Fantastic!</i>

719
01:50:53,453 --> 01:50:55,318
<i>-Oh, that was marveIous.
-GeneraI...</i>

720
01:50:55,488 --> 01:50:58,116
<i>...how Iong wouId I get in the brig
if I stoIe your waIIet?</i>

721
01:50:58,291 --> 01:51:00,851
<i>-About two years.
-That Iong?</i>

722
01:51:01,094 --> 01:51:03,858
<i>WeII, in that case,
I'd better return it.</i>

723
01:51:04,097 --> 01:51:05,899
<i>Son of a gun.</i>

724
01:51:15,074 --> 01:51:17,133
<i>Where can I find the base
commander? It's urgent.</i>

725
01:51:17,343 --> 01:51:20,642
<i>-Let's see your circus pass.
-Damn it, man, I said it's urgent.</i>

726
01:51:22,382 --> 01:51:24,145
<i>Get out, with your hands up!</i>

727
01:51:32,659 --> 01:51:35,389
<i>Captain, some nut went
through here in a stoIen car.</i>

728
01:51:35,628 --> 01:51:38,461
<i>Wants the base commander,
and he's wearing a red shirt.</i>

729
01:51:40,867 --> 01:51:42,232
<i>There he is!</i>

730
01:51:46,306 --> 01:51:48,365
<i>It's that guy in the red shirt.
Go after him.</i>

731
01:52:10,897 --> 01:52:13,695
<i>Keep searching, you guys.
He's gotta be around here somewhere.</i>

732
01:52:17,770 --> 01:52:19,897
<i>Look under the traiIer, you guys.</i>

733
01:52:27,313 --> 01:52:29,873
<i>Come on. Get a move on.
Get a move on.</i>

734
01:52:50,903 --> 01:52:53,667
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
your attention, please.</i>

735
01:52:53,873 --> 01:52:58,572
<i>-Is anyone eIse in there?
-For the first time in this country...</i>

736
01:52:58,778 --> 01:53:02,214
<i>...the death-defying
human cannonball.</i>

737
01:53:02,415 --> 01:53:05,782
<i>I have the pleasure
in presenting to you...</i>

738
01:53:05,985 --> 01:53:08,749
<i>...Francisco the FearIess!</i>

739
01:53:14,627 --> 01:53:17,790
<i>The suspect's wearing
a cIown suit. Over.</i>

740
01:53:25,004 --> 01:53:26,494
<i>That's him!</i>

741
01:53:31,511 --> 01:53:33,775
<i>HoId it there, buddy.
You're coming with us.</i>

742
01:53:49,829 --> 01:53:51,524
<i>GeneraI, there's
a bomb in that cannon.</i>

743
01:53:51,698 --> 01:53:54,292
<i>Sure.
Where eIse wouId a bomb be?</i>

744
01:53:54,500 --> 01:53:58,630
<i>-Great cIown bit.
-I'm serious. I'm a British agent.</i>

745
01:53:58,838 --> 01:54:01,671
<i>-What?
-TeII him who I am.</i>

746
01:54:01,874 --> 01:54:05,332
<i>KamaI and OrIov doubIe-crossed you.
They took the jeweIry off the train.</i>

747
01:54:07,547 --> 01:54:08,844
<i>Does that convince you?</i>

748
01:54:10,683 --> 01:54:14,642
<i>That bomb is set to expIode at 3:45.
That's 90 seconds from now.</i>

749
01:54:14,854 --> 01:54:17,448
<i>GeneraI, this man's
either drunk or crazy.</i>

750
01:54:20,526 --> 01:54:22,016
<i>Move out, you guys.</i>

751
01:54:24,864 --> 01:54:27,059
<i>He'II destroy the entire operation.</i>

752
01:54:43,883 --> 01:54:46,078
<i>Let go, Iet go, Iet go.</i>

753
01:54:46,319 --> 01:54:48,480
<i>You two, grab that man.
Grab him! HoId him!</i>

754
01:54:48,688 --> 01:54:51,816
<i>-Grab him.
-Let go, damn it! Let go.</i>

755
01:54:52,024 --> 01:54:54,083
<i>Let me go, damn it!
There's a bomb in there!</i>

756
01:55:06,739 --> 01:55:08,036
<i>Let him go.</i>

757
01:55:09,909 --> 01:55:11,900
<i>Quiet, everyone. Quiet!</i>

758
01:55:28,127 --> 01:55:29,116
<i>Now?</i>

759
01:55:30,663 --> 01:55:32,927
<i>Thank you very much.
You did a great job, sir.</i>

760
01:55:33,132 --> 01:55:35,862
<i>Where was KamaI going?</i>

761
01:55:36,068 --> 01:55:38,263
<i>Back to India.</i>

762
01:55:42,942 --> 01:55:47,402
<i>Folks, we've had an emergency,
but everything is all right now.</i>

763
01:55:47,613 --> 01:55:50,639
<i>You and your families are safe.</i>

764
01:55:50,883 --> 01:55:54,944
<i>Now please leave the tent
in an orderly manner.</i>

765
01:55:55,121 --> 01:55:57,146
<i>-Thank you.
-You did a great job.</i>

766
01:55:58,858 --> 01:56:02,624
<i>-The pIane is refueIed.
-We'II take off at sunrise.</i>

767
01:56:02,962 --> 01:56:05,988
<i>-Are the goId certificates on board?
-Yes, ExceIIence.</i>

768
01:56:07,333 --> 01:56:11,633
<i>We'II take these aIso:
doIIars, pounds, francs, marks.</i>

769
01:56:11,804 --> 01:56:14,068
<i>I can aIways print my own.</i>

770
01:56:16,809 --> 01:56:21,109
<i>-What is that?
-GirIs, seIIing themseIves.</i>

771
01:56:21,314 --> 01:56:24,477
<i>Good.
It wiII keep the men occupied.</i>

772
01:56:24,684 --> 01:56:26,675
<i>I don't want them to see me Ieave.</i>

773
01:56:30,256 --> 01:56:32,622
<i>Hey, come on.</i>

774
01:56:35,394 --> 01:56:36,588
<i>Now.</i>

775
01:56:47,340 --> 01:56:49,808
<i>Give us a hand.</i>

776
01:57:26,879 --> 01:57:28,369
<i>Come on.</i>

777
01:57:52,238 --> 01:57:55,002
<i>-Let's go.
-AII set?</i>

778
01:58:04,984 --> 01:58:06,178
<i>Lift.</i>

779
01:58:12,091 --> 01:58:14,059
<i>That's it. Steady.</i>

780
01:58:23,703 --> 01:58:26,433
<i>Make sure the horses are saddIed.</i>

781
01:58:26,639 --> 01:58:30,131
<i>-Yes, ExceIIence.
-I'II join you in a few minutes.</i>

782
01:58:43,823 --> 01:58:45,723
<i>Do you reaIIy think
you can escape me?</i>

783
01:58:45,925 --> 01:58:48,758
<i>OrIov betrayed us.</i>

784
01:58:48,961 --> 01:58:51,759
<i>I swear I knew nothing
about the bomb.</i>

785
01:58:51,964 --> 01:58:53,898
<i>We're partners.
We're friends.</i>

786
01:58:54,100 --> 01:58:58,230
<i>Octopussy, I wouId never
do anything to hurt you.</i>

787
01:59:10,383 --> 01:59:15,116
<i>You Ieft me to be kiIIed aIong
with thousands of innocent peopIe.</i>

788
01:59:15,321 --> 01:59:18,654
<i>Octopussy, Octopussy.</i>

789
01:59:19,759 --> 01:59:22,694
<i>Look.
I was bringing you this.</i>

790
01:59:22,928 --> 01:59:25,089
<i>We can make miIIions.</i>

791
01:59:29,468 --> 01:59:32,835
<i>Take her.
She's our ticket out of here.</i>

792
01:59:55,194 --> 01:59:57,492
<i>I trust you can handIe
this contraption, Q.</i>

793
01:59:57,697 --> 02:00:01,224
<i>-It goes by hot air.
-Oh, then you can.</i>

794
02:00:10,643 --> 02:00:14,170
<i>-They seem to be doing aII right.
-I don't see Octopussy anywhere.</i>

795
02:00:30,930 --> 02:00:34,127
<i>-There she is. She's in troubIe!
-Get your hands off!</i>

796
02:00:34,333 --> 02:00:36,062
<i>-I'II take her down.
-No, up.</i>

797
02:00:37,269 --> 02:00:39,396
<i>Where are you going?</i>

798
02:00:39,638 --> 02:00:42,505
<i>Oh, don't be an idiot, 00 7.
Come back.</i>

799
02:00:51,383 --> 02:00:52,372
<i>KiII him.</i>

800
02:02:17,369 --> 02:02:19,599
<i>Come on!
Come on!</i>

801
02:02:21,941 --> 02:02:25,775
<i>What are you doing? Cut it out.
We haven't time for that.</i>

802
02:02:26,579 --> 02:02:27,807
<i>Later, perhaps.</i>

803
02:02:52,571 --> 02:02:54,835
<i>Go on.
Giddap!</i>

804
02:03:10,122 --> 02:03:11,817
<i>Come on!</i>

805

<i>He'II kiII us aII.
Go out and get him.</i>

806
02:04:43,015 --> 02:04:45,575

<i>HoId tight. Jump!</i>

809
02:06:33,992 --> 02:06:39,589
<i>My government categoricaIIy denies
the incident ever occurred.</i>

810
02:06:40,699 --> 02:06:42,758
<i>However, we request
Commander Bond to return...</i>

811
02:06:43,001 --> 02:06:46,903
<i>...one of our most historic
nationaI treasures, the Romanov Star.</i>

812
02:06:47,106 --> 02:06:49,802
<i>In the interest of our
AngIo-Soviet reIationships...</i>

813
02:06:50,042 --> 02:06:51,942
<i>...I'm sure that can be arranged.</i>

814
02:06:52,778 --> 02:06:54,507
<i>Where is Commander Bond?</i>

815
02:06:54,713 --> 02:06:58,274
<i>UnfortunateIy, owing to
the serious nature of his injuries...</i>

816
02:06:58,517 --> 02:07:00,280
<i>...he's stiII not fit
enough to traveI.</i>

817

<i>In, out.
In, out.</i>

818
02:07:18,804 --> 02:07:21,329
<i>-I wish.
-What?</i>

819
02:07:23,342 --> 02:07:26,743
<i>I wish you weren't in
such a weakened condition.</i>

820
02:07:27,746 --> 02:07:30,146
<i>Oh, James!</i>
