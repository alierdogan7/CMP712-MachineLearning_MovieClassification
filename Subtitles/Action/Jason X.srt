- I'm taking the specimen.

You can't. I haven't prepped
the cryostasis chamber.

- We've already discussed this.

Yeah, well, I had to go
over your head.

I'm moving him

him through open country.

No one's here.
You're safe with us.

173
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:30,960
There was a leak
in the cryo unit and...

174
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:36,320
<i>- Was he contained?
- Was contained.</i>

175
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:39,480
<i>But when the cryo unit ruptured,
you didn't escape it.</i>

176
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:41,640
<i>It put you into stasis.</i>

177
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:44,840
For how long?

178
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:49,560
The year is 2455.

179
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:52,800
<i>Now, I know this is
a huge shock,</i>

180
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:55,760
<i>but you're going
to be safe here.</i>

181
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:02,240
You're aboard grendel. A class
four catamaran transport ship.

182
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:04,600
<i>We're on our way
back home</i>

183
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:06,720
<i>and you're gonna be
just fine.</i>

184
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:17,560
2455?

185
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:24,040
That's over 400 years.

186
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:34,600
Secure line.
Perez, dieter.

187
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:37,360
Solaris research
station. Connect.

188
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:40,480
<i>[Beeping]</i>

189
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:51,200
- Lowe, you bastard.
- We've hit the motherlode.

190
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:54,160
- Do you know what time it is?
- I don't care.

191
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:59,160
- We've got a gold mine.
- A box of DVDs is not a gold mine.

192
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:01,200
I've told you
I can't move them.

193
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:05,320
Just look at the file.
Two 400-year-old specimens.

194
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:08,000
One well-preserved,
the other one--

195
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:10,560
are you ready for this?
Up and walking around.

196
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:14,320
400 years old
and walking around.

197
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:17,280
Yeah. 455 years,
to be exact.

198
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:20,000
Who cares?
Who gives a shit?

199
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:22,720
People. People will pay
huge money to see her.

200
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:24,680
Let me ask
you a question--

201
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:28,160
is this the first person
you've reanimated?

202
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:31,560
- Of course not.
- How many people are out there today

203
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:34,720
walking around,
thawed out and looking good?

204
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:36,400
- Hundreds.
- Thousands.

205
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:39,240
Maybe.
But not 450 years old.

206
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:43,320
<i>- She's twice as old as anyone on the planet.
- 250, 450.</i>

207
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:44,640
What's the difference?

208
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:47,080
Doctor, 100 years ago when re-animation

209
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:51,040
was more unpredictable,
sure, maybe.

210
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:56,000
- But now it's old news.
- Damn it. I need money.

211
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:59,280
I know, I know.

212
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:05,200
<i>The other viable
is marked Voorhees.</i>

213
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:08,160
That's not
Jason Voorhees, is it?

214
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:09,680
What do you know about him?

215
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:12,160
Jason Voorhees.

216
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:15,840
He killed nearly
200 people

217
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:18,680
and simply disappeared
without a trace.

218
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:22,360
Under the right buyer,
he could be worth a fortune.

219
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:26,080
I've got him frozen
right here on the ship.

220
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:29,080
- You work out a list of ownership?
- No list.

221
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:31,760
He's my find.
He's mine.

222
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:34,720
- What about your students?
- They're students.

223
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:36,720
The educational experience
will be enough.

224
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:39,960
Doctor, doctor,
you are one son of a bitch.

225
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,680
Soon to be one rich
son of a bitch.

226
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:43,040
Lowe out.

227
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:49,600
Professor,
I think that...

228
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:51,960
We need to talk

229
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,480
about my midterm.

230
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:41,160
Oh, poor baby.
No wonder you wore this thing.

231
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:49,080
Harder.

232
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:50,520
Harder.

233
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:53,680
Who's been a naughty
little boy?

234
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:55,360
I have.

235
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:58,400
- Harder. - You want it a little harder?

236
00:25:58,440 --> 00:25:59,920
- Yeah.
- How's that?

237
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,240
- Oh, God. That's it.
- That's it right there?!

238
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:04,720
- Oh, yeah.
- Daddy likes it hard?

239
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:06,080
<i>- Yeah!
- Daddy wants it hard?!</i>

240
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:07,840
<i>- Oh, yeah. That's it.
- Right there?!</i>

241
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:09,520
You like it right there?

242
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:11,440
- A little harder for daddy?! - Yeah!

243
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:15,400
- Come on, come on!
- You pass!

244
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:11,680
- What do you think?
- Hmm?

245
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:13,880
- Do you like them?
- They're fine.

246
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:20,520
Look, Kay-Em, I don't think
this is going to work.

247
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:23,080
Why do you want
those things, anyways?

248
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:25,240
- Janessa has them.
- Well, janessa's...

249
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:27,200
- Real?
- Yes.

250
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:30,080
Let's not complicate
things, all right?

251
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:32,240
I like you just
the way you are.

252
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:34,000
I think
you're perfect.

253
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:35,480
Okay.

254
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:00,920
[Muffled scream]

255
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:09,360
[Shrieking]
Help me!

256
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:12,640
Somebody help me!

257
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:20,400
No! No!

258
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:22,160
No!!

259
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:01,000
I brought you
something to eat.

260
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:05,240
Not much longer
and we'll be at earth two.

261
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:07,600
Earth two?
What happened to earth one?

262
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:09,960
It's dead.

263
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:12,920
The oceans, the soil--
neither will sustain life.

264
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,480
Can I do anything else
for you?

265
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:37,160
You want to tell me
what happened down there?

266
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:39,160
I take it being stabbed
and frozen

267
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:41,040
wasn't part of your plan.

268
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:42,600
I'm a...

269
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:46,200
I was a project leader
at crystal lake research.

270
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:49,640
- The subject was Jason Voorhees.
- Jason Voorhees?

271
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:51,920
Notorious murderer?

272
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:56,920
We executed him
for the first time in 2008.

273
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:58,240
- For the first time?
- Mm-hmm.

274
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:00,080
We tried everything.

275
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:02,560
Electrocution, gas,
firing squad,

276
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:06,120
we even hung him once.
Nothing worked.

277
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:08,880
Finally it was decided that
if we couldn't terminate him,

278
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:11,160
we could at least contain him--
cryogenic stasis.

279
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:13,240
Freeze him till we could
figure out what to do.

280
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:15,560
- Seems sensible.
- I thought so.

281
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:17,880
But unfortunately some people
who were too smart

282
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:19,520
for their own good,

283
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:21,800
felt that a creature
that couldn't be killed,

284
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:24,360
was simply too valuable
to just file away.

285
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:28,640
In the end it always
comes down to money.

286
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:36,240
How do you thank someone
who gives you back your life?

287
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:39,040
You're going to be alive
for a long time.

288
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:40,560
We'll figure out something.

289
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:49,720
Why don't you
just admit it?

290
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:51,400
You want me.

291
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:55,280
I could never be with a girl whose
balls are bigger than mine.

292
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:00,920
Guys, our star patient
is back.

293
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:02,720
Rowan, this is tsunaron
and janessa.

294
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:04,440
- Hi.
- Hi.

295
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:06,880
I see that
my clothes fit okay.

296
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:09,800
Oh, these are yours?
They're great. Thank you.

297
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:12,000
Whoa.

298
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:13,440
What are those?

299
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:15,800
These are janessa's
love children.

300
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:19,040
You see now, it is that wit of yours

301
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:21,720
that is what repels
all human females.

302
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:24,800
- And of course you've met sergeant Brodski.
- Yes. Hi again.

303
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:28,440
- Hi. - And this is the lovely Kay-Em 14,

304
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:30,680
tsunaron's little
love-bot.

305
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:32,360
Easy, janessa.

306
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:35,120
Kay-Em is a knowledge
matrix android

307
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:36,600
that I have been
programming.

308
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:38,520
Amazing.

309
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:44,160
- She looks so real.
- I am real.

310
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:46,360
- Where do you want this?
- Lab two, I think.

311
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:47,880
Whoa, whoa,
where did you get that?

312
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:50,200
From your friend, the big
guy with the hockey mask.

313
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:54,160
- You brought him on board?
- He's in the next lab. We're quite safe.

314
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:57,960
- "Safe"?
- Our scans reveal him to be very dead.

315
00:32:58,040 --> 00:33:01,120
Could your scans
be wrong?

316
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:04,760
I think you should just get rid
of him, he's too dangerous.

317
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:07,840
That would be irresponsible and foolhardy.

318
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:11,080
He's a valuable scientific artifact
that must be carefully preserved.

319
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:12,920
Much like yourself.

320
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:16,840
He is an unstoppable
killing machine.

321
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:19,120
<i>He's not dead.</i>

322
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:21,720
Believe me,
he's definitely dead.

323
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:24,040
Show me.

324
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:28,400
<i>Brodski: I'm putting us on lockdown.</i>

325
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:30,240
Attention, we have
a hostile on board.

326
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:32,440
<i>- Grunt team, report to weapons.
- The chick?</i>

327
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:34,640
<i>Repeat, we have
a hostile on board.</i>

328
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:36,160
<i>Grunt team,
report to weapons.</i>

329
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:39,320
Everyone else,
get to lab one.

330
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:42,000
- Baby, I'm not ready yet.
- Hurry up.

331
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:45,040
[Screams]

332
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:02,240
Grunt team's assembled.
Dallas is a no-show.

333
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:03,840
- Sergeant--
- where the hell is he?

334
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:05,400
<i>- Don't know, sarge.
- Damn!</i>

335
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:07,080
Look, we need to talk.

336
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:08,440
- Do you have all your kids yet? - Yes.

337
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:10,200
<i>- [Whimpering]
- Oh, God.</i>

338
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:15,640
Stoney...
Stoney's dead.

339
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:17,960
- Oh, my God.
- Stoney's dead.

340
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:21,880
Kicker!
I want full armor and tac.

341
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:24,440
I want nothing left of this guy
by the time we reach solaris.

You heard him grunts,
let's get moving!

343
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:29,320
Whoa, whoa! Nothing left of him?
What have you got in mind?

344
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:31,160
Take your kids
to lab one,

345
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:33,200

00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:49,040
Yeah, but I got my groove on,
you know what I'm saying?

353
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:52,320
- So what do you say, next kill wins?
- Lock and load.

354

- Yes, it does.

- We are less than an hour from solaris.

372

They have seven
fully-equipped tactical units,

373

that are more than capable
of taking care of this.

374

- I am taking this guy out.

- No, you want him alive.

379
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:41,880

You're with me.

387

Sarge, what do we do
when we find this guy?

389
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:10,960
Well, I promised the doc

So after you blow him
all to hell,

392
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:18,240
- put one in his leg so we can say we tried.
- All: Yeah!

393
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:44,400
Oh, lord.

Condor, kicker and I

402

- Maybe he gave up.
- You really think so?

Shh, shh, shh.

519

I don't think
he's out there.

520

Why don't you just stick your
head out and have a peek?

Hi.

With my help

530

I know people.
I have connections.

531

How do we get off this ship?

00:54:50,040 --> 00:54:52,800
- I don't know.
- Could you beam us off or something?

Hell yeah.
The shuttle.

548
00:55:06,280 --> 00:55:08,280
- What about it, crutch?
- Yeah.

549
00:55:08,360 --> 00:55:10,160
I can do pre-launch
from the bridge.

550
00:55:10,200 --> 00:55:12,600
Good, good. The rest of us
will head to the shuttle.

551
00:55:12,680 --> 00:55:15,400
- We'll start the launch list.
- I'm with you, crutch.

[Gasps]

553

Whoa, whoa, whoa.
You know how to use that?

554
00:55:27,320 --> 00:55:28,920
Yep. It's just like
riding a bike.

- Once you learn, you never forget how.
- Good.

556
00:55:31,040 --> 00:55:32,880
Kay-Em and I will go
to the supply hold.

557
00:55:32,920 --> 00:55:35,360
- We'll meet you at the shuttle bay.
- See you there.

558
00:55:36,280 --> 00:55:38,240
What's a bike?

559
00:55:38,320 --> 00:55:40,160
There's enough fire power here
to level a moon.

560
00:55:40,240 --> 00:55:42,840
I say we pack this stuff up
and head for the shuttle.

561
00:55:42,880 --> 00:55:44,680
What do you think?
Are we going to make it?

562
00:55:44,760 --> 00:55:47,920
The statistical probability
of survival is 12%.

563
00:55:47,960 --> 00:55:51,080
12%?! Can't you come up with better odds?

564
00:55:51,160 --> 00:55:54,680
- Nope.
- Bullshit, Kay-Em! That's bullshit!

565
00:55:54,760 --> 00:55:58,160
Preparation for launch may be
a relatively simple procedure,

566
00:55:58,200 --> 00:56:00,200
but getting there alive...

567
00:56:00,280 --> 00:56:01,800
It is a problem.

568
00:56:01,880 --> 00:56:03,440
Are you telling me
there's absolutely

569
00:56:03,480 --> 00:56:05,880
no chance for us
to better our odds?!

570
00:56:13,080 --> 00:56:14,960
Statistical probability
of survival

571
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:18,800
just went up to 53%.

572
00:56:18,840 --> 00:56:20,840

573
00:56:51,080 --> 00:56:52,720

00:56:52,760 --> 00:56:54,960
Quiet.

575
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:57,240
But if he's in here,
he's going to kill us.

576
00:56:57,280 --> 00:56:58,600
Be quiet.

577
00:56:58,680 --> 00:57:01,840

- She's good with people.

579

- Did you see that?
- What?

580
00:57:09,720 --> 00:57:11,920

still alive over there.

581

is the shuttle bay?

00:57:23,280 --> 00:57:24,840
