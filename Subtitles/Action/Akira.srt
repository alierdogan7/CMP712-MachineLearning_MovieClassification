1
00:01:40,308 --> 00:01:44,853
"Haruki-ya"

2
00:01:57,659 --> 00:02:01,703
Groups of unemployed workers, who have
grown in number due to the tax reforms

3
00:02:01,913 --> 00:02:05,040
enacted by the former Prime Minister,
are rioting all across the country.

4
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:08,585
And with the confusion among members
of Parliament sparked by the comments of

5
00:02:08,795 --> 00:02:12,089
Finance Minister Takanashi
during a recent Parliament inquiry,

6
00:02:12,298 --> 00:02:16,593
there seems to be no compromise in sight
between the government and opposition.

7
00:02:16,803 --> 00:02:18,470
Hey. What'll it be?

8
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:20,848
Give me three peanuts.

9
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:24,226
Let's see here...

10
00:02:38,658 --> 00:02:41,326
We've herded those
Clown bastards onto Route 5.

11
00:02:44,289 --> 00:02:46,790
Damn it, don't scare me like that!
Open the damn door quietly!

12
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,502
You wouldn't be so jumpy if
you didn't have something to hide!

13
00:02:52,839 --> 00:02:54,423
Try selling some normal
drinks sometime, huh?

14
00:02:54,632 --> 00:02:58,552
How about buying something
for once?! This ain't a hangout!

15
00:02:58,761 --> 00:03:01,054
And drink that dog piss you sell?!

16
00:03:04,559 --> 00:03:08,937
Twin ceramic rotor drives on each wheel...

17
00:03:09,147 --> 00:03:14,318
And these are... Computer
controlled anti-lock brakes...

18
00:03:14,527 --> 00:03:17,779
200 horsepower at 12,000 rpm...

19
00:03:19,908 --> 00:03:22,326
You wanna ride it, Tetsuo?

20
00:03:22,535 --> 00:03:24,912
All right, let's go!

21
00:03:26,789 --> 00:03:30,792
That bike's been customized just for me.
It's too wild. You couldn't handle it.

22
00:03:31,544 --> 00:03:34,213
I don't see how you can
ride something like that, man.

23
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:37,799
I could!

24
00:03:38,009 --> 00:03:41,136
If you want one so bad,
steal a big one for yourself.

25
00:04:46,953 --> 00:04:47,828
Unbelievable.

26
00:04:48,037 --> 00:04:50,914
School kids these days...

27
00:04:51,124 --> 00:04:53,625
Wait! Hey, waiter!

28
00:04:56,879 --> 00:04:59,840
They ran into the alley! After 'em!

29
00:05:13,062 --> 00:05:16,023
This isn't a game, you idiot!

30
00:05:18,943 --> 00:05:20,902
Shit...!

31
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:25,342
That's...

32
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:27,928
This is car 375.

33
00:06:28,137 --> 00:06:33,058
We've got reports of biker gangs fighting
near the intersection of Highway 14 south!

34
00:06:33,267 --> 00:06:37,938
Request immediate assistance!
Car 375, en route to the scene!

35
00:06:38,147 --> 00:06:39,523
It's the cops! What should we do?

36
00:06:39,732 --> 00:06:42,859
Damn, and my motor coils
were just getting warmed up...

37
00:06:47,949 --> 00:06:49,449
Bastards...

38
00:06:49,659 --> 00:06:51,535
Let's go, Tetsuo!

39
00:06:51,744 --> 00:06:52,744
Right!

40
00:06:52,954 --> 00:06:54,496
Damn!

41
00:07:04,048 --> 00:07:07,050
A skirmish has broken out
between student protesters

42
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:10,053
and riot police assigned as security.
There appear to be some casualties.

43
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:11,471
Furthermore...

44
00:07:28,239 --> 00:07:29,531
What the...?

45
00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:33,702
What the hell's going on?!

46
00:07:33,911 --> 00:07:36,455
Move it, jerk! I'm in a hurry!

47
00:07:51,846 --> 00:07:53,221
What was that?!

48
00:07:53,431 --> 00:07:54,890
Call the police!

49
00:08:01,314 --> 00:08:04,900
Repeal the tax reforms!

50
00:08:21,042 --> 00:08:27,088
This area is off-limits!
Go back! It's dangerous!

51
00:08:27,298 --> 00:08:28,298
Something's strange here...

52
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:30,175
Let me through! I'm sorry, let me through!

53
00:08:30,384 --> 00:08:32,010
What's the big idea?

54
00:08:39,435 --> 00:08:41,353
Look! Blood!

55
00:08:42,021 --> 00:08:43,230
Who are they?

56
00:08:43,439 --> 00:08:44,523
...Excuse me.
... Hey! Don't push!

57
00:08:44,732 --> 00:08:45,315
Excuse me.

58
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:47,484
Hey! Watch it, jerk!

59
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:53,240
Pardon me. I'm sorry.

60
00:08:53,449 --> 00:08:54,658
Ryu!

61
00:08:54,867 --> 00:08:56,660
Hey! He ran away!

62
00:09:02,416 --> 00:09:04,084
He's got a gun!

63
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:12,926
Fire!

64
00:09:13,135 --> 00:09:15,470
Hold your fire! There's a kid with him!

65
00:09:25,439 --> 00:09:27,899
Run...

66
00:09:28,109 --> 00:09:30,026
Hurry...

67
00:09:34,156 --> 00:09:35,865
Go to Ryu...

68
00:09:36,075 --> 00:09:38,952
Ryu will help you now...

69
00:09:42,665 --> 00:09:46,126
Hurry... Get out of here...

70
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:18,783
Kei!

71
00:10:21,037 --> 00:10:23,288
What are you doing? Hurry!

72
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:29,169
He vanished...!

73
00:10:37,803 --> 00:10:40,055
He's to the west.

74
00:10:40,264 --> 00:10:43,475
The west? He's in the old city, then.

75
00:10:54,236 --> 00:10:55,570
Eat this!

76
00:11:07,958 --> 00:11:09,751
Tetsuo!

77
00:11:25,393 --> 00:11:28,687
"Closed: Beyond this point is
unrepaired, unrestored Old City area. "

78
00:11:38,572 --> 00:11:41,074
"Oppose Imperialism"

79
00:11:48,749 --> 00:11:51,876
Ryu! Ryu, where are you?

80
00:11:55,172 --> 00:11:56,381
Kei!

81
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:24,159
No, that's...!

82
00:12:45,473 --> 00:12:47,015
How you like that?!

83
00:12:56,233 --> 00:12:58,735
Well? Who is it?

84
00:12:58,944 --> 00:13:01,446
It's not him! It's not Tetsuo!

85
00:13:01,655 --> 00:13:03,448
Okay! Let's go!

86
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:13,541
You little... What did you do...?

87
00:13:26,347 --> 00:13:29,224
Tetsuo! Hang on! Hey!

88
00:13:31,393 --> 00:13:32,727
Huh? What did you say?

89
00:13:32,937 --> 00:13:34,604
That kid...

90
00:13:37,608 --> 00:13:40,235
He's hurt bad!

91
00:13:40,444 --> 00:13:43,655
Hey! Wait!

92
00:13:43,864 --> 00:13:44,739
We gotta get him to a hospital!

93
00:13:44,949 --> 00:13:48,576
...He needs an ambulance!
... We can't move him!

94
00:13:58,087 --> 00:13:59,921
W- What the hell?!

95
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:16,229
There's no escape.

96
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:24,779
We've come for you.

97
00:14:30,286 --> 00:14:36,040
We can't survive on the outside.
Come on, let's go home.

98
00:14:38,627 --> 00:14:40,920
It's the army! Those are army helicopters!

99
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:49,345
Move out!

100
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:02,191
Down on your stomachs!
Spread your arms and legs!

101
00:15:02,401 --> 00:15:05,111
Um... We're just, uh...

102
00:15:05,321 --> 00:15:07,572
Down on your stomachs!
Spread your arms and legs!

103
00:15:17,124 --> 00:15:19,250
Ow... Damn it, that hurts!

104
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:20,668
Kai!

105
00:15:26,634 --> 00:15:27,258
Hey!

106
00:15:27,468 --> 00:15:28,426
Sir?

107
00:15:28,636 --> 00:15:29,302
Who are they?

108
00:15:29,511 --> 00:15:31,638
They seem to be an ordinary bike gang, sir.

109
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:50,281
We're going back.

110
00:15:50,491 --> 00:15:52,075
Ow! Hey, wait a minute!

111
00:15:52,284 --> 00:15:54,077
My arms don't bend that way, damn it!

112
00:15:54,286 --> 00:15:57,288
Load the wounded onto the helicopter!

113
00:15:57,498 --> 00:15:58,414
Tetsuo!

114
00:15:58,624 --> 00:16:01,000
Wait! Where are you taking him?

115
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:02,752
Kaneda!

116
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:05,922
What the hell? We didn't do anything!

117
00:16:06,131 --> 00:16:08,007
He's heavy...!

118
00:16:48,716 --> 00:16:52,885
"Tokyo Olympics"
"147 Days to the Opening Ceremonies"

119
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:55,680
"Student ID"

120
00:16:55,889 --> 00:16:56,723
"Ward 8 Vocational Education High School"
"Kaneda"

00:16:56,932 --> 00:16:57,724
"The Student's Ten Moral Precepts"

122
00:17:08,068 --> 00:17:14,282
So you and your friends went out at night
on your bikes to visit your dying mother,

123
00:17:14,491 --> 00:17:18,077
and a group of hooligans called
the Clowns picked a fight with you.

124
00:17:18,287 --> 00:17:20,538
They hurt your friend,
so you lost your temper,

125
00:17:20,748 --> 00:17:24,292
which is why eight Clown
members are now in the hospital.

126
00:17:24,501 --> 00:17:25,710
That's your story?

127
00:17:26,837 --> 00:17:28,421
She's cute!

128
00:17:29,506 --> 00:17:30,757
Hey! You can't look at this!

129
00:17:30,966 --> 00:17:32,341
And how's your mother doing?!

130
00:17:32,551 --> 00:17:33,718
Huh? Oh.

131
00:17:33,927 --> 00:17:36,345
Luckily, she made it
through the worst of it last night.

132
00:17:36,555 --> 00:17:40,224
And I suppose she's made it over
the mountains on a bike by now?

133
00:17:45,773 --> 00:17:47,273
It couldn't be these bozos.

134
00:17:47,483 --> 00:17:49,275
You can tell that just by looking.

135
00:17:49,359 --> 00:17:50,359
"#8 Interrogation Room"

136
00:17:50,944 --> 00:17:53,696
Wait on that bench. Understand?

137
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:56,449
How much longer are
we gonna have to wait?

138
00:17:56,658 --> 00:17:59,243
Okay! The next five, come get in here!

139
00:18:01,163 --> 00:18:08,002
So the army's working with the police to
hunt down anti-government groups now, huh?

140
00:18:12,674 --> 00:18:16,260
...Wanna put up a fight, huh?
... He's holding something!

141
00:18:18,305 --> 00:18:20,098
Bastard!

142
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:24,852
Long live the freedom revolution!

143
00:18:27,856 --> 00:18:29,107
He's got a grenade!

144
00:18:35,864 --> 00:18:38,074
Crazy son of a bitch!

145
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:48,042
All right, that's enough! Take him away!

146
00:18:48,252 --> 00:18:50,086
We'll really teach him a lesson later.

147
00:18:50,295 --> 00:18:53,923
You dumb bastard! If you wanna die,
just hang yourself or something!

148
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:58,678
Hey! You people can go.
We've contacted your school.

149
00:18:58,887 --> 00:19:00,054
What? You son of a...

150
00:19:00,264 --> 00:19:02,557
Hey, hold on a minute, pops!

151
00:19:02,766 --> 00:19:04,142
"Pops"?!

152
00:19:04,351 --> 00:19:06,227
There was one more of us.

153
00:19:06,436 --> 00:19:07,270
What?

154
00:19:07,479 --> 00:19:08,896
Pardon me.

155
00:19:12,568 --> 00:19:13,693
What're you...

156
00:19:13,902 --> 00:19:16,112
This is her. Can she leave with us?

157
00:19:16,321 --> 00:19:18,948
Who are you calling "Pops," you punk?

158
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:20,241
Ow!

159
00:19:20,450 --> 00:19:24,954
Look here, kid! I'm only 25!
I'm not even married!

160
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:28,833
So watch your mouth! She can go with you!

161
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:32,920
Call a doctor!

162
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:37,633
So I think the army was chasing
that weird kid Kaneda saw...

163
00:19:37,843 --> 00:19:39,719
I think I saw him, too.

164
00:19:39,928 --> 00:19:41,429
And what about Tetsuo?

165
00:19:41,638 --> 00:19:44,015
Why the hell wouldn't they
tell us what hospital he's in?

166
00:19:44,224 --> 00:19:45,600
What did you say?!

167
00:19:45,809 --> 00:19:49,145
I was just wondering if you wanted to
grab some tea or something over there.

168
00:19:49,354 --> 00:19:54,734
I figured we could have a nice,
long talk about that "revolution" deal.

169
00:19:55,861 --> 00:19:58,905
Skirt-chasers will try anything these days...

170
00:19:59,114 --> 00:20:01,824
You'll help anyone so
long as they're a girl, won't you?

171
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:04,744
No way! I have high standards!

172
00:20:04,953 --> 00:20:07,747
It's not their looks that count.

173
00:20:07,956 --> 00:20:11,751
It's their... I dunno, their
sensitivity that moves me.

174
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:16,088
I suppose I owe you one.
Thank you very much, uh...

175
00:20:16,298 --> 00:20:17,590
I'm Kaneda. Nice to meet you.

176
00:20:17,799 --> 00:20:20,134
See you around, Kaneda.

177
00:20:20,344 --> 00:20:23,054
You're leaving already? Don't be like that!

178
00:20:23,263 --> 00:20:27,391
Hey, come on! I did save you and all!

179
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:34,941
At least tell me your name, you bitch!

180
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:41,072
I'll try talking with them for
the time being, but it's risky.

181
00:20:41,281 --> 00:20:46,410
If they think you're trying to avoid taking
responsibility, it'll blow up in your face.

182
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:50,248
I can't believe that there's a
mole on the executive council.

183
00:20:50,457 --> 00:20:51,999
Even if that's true...

184
00:20:52,209 --> 00:20:54,043
That isn't important.

185
00:20:54,253 --> 00:20:58,506
What's important is diplomacy and political
maneuvering, which you seem to despise.

186
00:20:58,715 --> 00:21:00,925
I never studied them in school, you see.

187
00:21:01,134 --> 00:21:03,886
In any case, at the next
executive council meeting,

188
00:21:04,096 --> 00:21:09,600
your poor management of this last
incident will be called into question.

189
00:21:12,896 --> 00:21:15,231
There's a phone call for the Colonel.

190
00:21:17,401 --> 00:21:20,027
You should put your affairs in order.

191
00:21:23,573 --> 00:21:25,116
It's me.

192
00:21:46,221 --> 00:21:47,805
This way, Colonel.

193
00:21:48,765 --> 00:21:50,808
I'm terribly sorry to call you here,

194
00:21:51,018 --> 00:21:54,061
but there's something you really must see.

195
00:21:58,358 --> 00:21:59,650
Please observe.

196
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:02,903
It's the special pattern from that young boy.

197
00:22:03,113 --> 00:22:05,114
It doesn't resemble any I've seen so far,

198
00:22:05,324 --> 00:22:08,242
and I've never seen a developmental
speed or configuration like this.

199
00:22:08,452 --> 00:22:12,913
It may have begun with the shock of
contact with Number 26, or possibly...

200
00:22:13,123 --> 00:22:15,583
Have you finished running a
comparison with Akira's pattern?

201
00:22:15,792 --> 00:22:17,626
I'll superimpose it over this one.

202
00:22:22,466 --> 00:22:27,762
This projection was constructed using
mixed data, so a comparison is difficult,

203
00:22:27,971 --> 00:22:31,932
but I believe this boy's
pattern is the key to solving

204
00:22:32,142 --> 00:22:34,894
the riddle of Akira's pattern growth process.

205
00:22:35,103 --> 00:22:36,687
All right. Continue.

206
00:22:36,897 --> 00:22:38,397
Very well, sir. Thank you.

207
00:22:38,607 --> 00:22:42,193
I'm sure he'll turn out to be a
worthy addition to the Numbers.

208
00:22:43,695 --> 00:22:45,404
It may be rough on him,

209
00:22:45,614 --> 00:22:48,949
but I thought we might try
starting him off with level 7 capsules.

210
00:22:49,159 --> 00:22:50,242
Is it safe?

211
00:22:50,452 --> 00:22:51,494
Leave everything to me.

212
00:22:51,703 --> 00:22:53,746
That's not what I meant!

213
00:22:53,955 --> 00:22:58,751
I'm asking that if he turns out to
have power like Akira's like you said,

214
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:02,254
will we be able to control it?

215
00:23:02,464 --> 00:23:04,590
Well, that's...

216
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:06,425
Can I leave this to you?

217
00:23:06,635 --> 00:23:11,889
Well, if we use the latest examination
equipment to collect even more data

218
00:23:12,099 --> 00:23:15,810
and do a multifaceted
analysis, then surely...

219
00:23:18,271 --> 00:23:22,358
Maybe we shouldn't touch that power.

220
00:23:22,567 --> 00:23:25,694
The power of God?

221
00:23:27,864 --> 00:23:30,574
A... ki... ra...

222
00:23:30,784 --> 00:23:36,664
But we have to. We have
to touch it and control it.

223
00:23:36,873 --> 00:23:40,584
If it looks like it's too much for us
to handle, terminate him at once!

224
00:23:40,794 --> 00:23:42,420
There can be no hesitation!

225
00:23:42,629 --> 00:23:44,338
Very well, Colonel.

226
00:23:44,548 --> 00:23:47,675
"Ward 8 Vocational Training School"

227
00:23:47,884 --> 00:23:52,346
If trash like you, that can't keep up with
the academic ability of regular students

228
00:23:52,556 --> 00:23:56,559
and can't adapt to living in a group,
screw up here, it's the end of the road!

229
00:23:56,768 --> 00:24:00,229
Even if you're under 15, if you get more
than 50 penalty points on your record,

230
00:24:00,439 --> 00:24:02,565
you're sent to the regular courts!

231
00:24:02,774 --> 00:24:05,067
Bite me! Don't mess with us, you bald goat!

232
00:24:05,277 --> 00:24:06,694
Aren't any of you listening?

233
00:24:06,903 --> 00:24:09,280
...You lost me halfway through!
... Discipline!

234
00:24:09,489 --> 00:24:10,573
Discipline!

235
00:24:10,782 --> 00:24:11,907
...Discipline!
... Ow!

236
00:24:12,117 --> 00:24:14,410
Discipline! Discipline!

237
00:24:14,619 --> 00:24:15,786
Discipline!

238
00:24:15,996 --> 00:24:17,705
Dismissed!

239
00:24:17,914 --> 00:24:21,542
Thank you very much, sir!

240
00:24:22,627 --> 00:24:25,754
You bastard! You and me are
gonna go at it someday, jack!

241
00:24:25,964 --> 00:24:26,839
We're gonna remember this!

242
00:24:27,048 --> 00:24:28,048
I hope you rot and die!

243
00:24:28,258 --> 00:24:29,800
You sick bastard!

244
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:31,177
Shit...

245
00:24:36,641 --> 00:24:38,184
Yamagata!

246
00:24:38,393 --> 00:24:40,102
What happened to your cheek?

247
00:24:40,312 --> 00:24:41,437
Shut the hell up.

248
00:24:41,646 --> 00:24:43,397
Let me guess, Jaws from P.E.?

249
00:24:43,607 --> 00:24:46,317
They say you fought the
Clowns on a highway in the old city!

250
00:24:46,526 --> 00:24:46,734
Yeah.

251
00:24:46,943 --> 00:24:50,070
Why don't you just wipe 'em out?
Those guys are so gross!

252
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:51,697
And last night...

253
00:24:51,907 --> 00:24:53,699
There were demonstrators,
cops, and even the damn army!

254
00:24:53,909 --> 00:24:55,743
And that idiot Tetsuo had an accident, too.

255
00:24:55,952 --> 00:24:57,411
What happened to Tetsuo?

256
00:24:57,621 --> 00:24:59,413
He's in the hospital.
I guess, but we don't know where.

257
00:24:59,623 --> 00:25:01,916
The idiot was trying to show off.

258
00:25:04,961 --> 00:25:06,045
That idiot...

259
00:25:06,254 --> 00:25:08,047
What, you mean Tetsuo?

260
00:25:08,256 --> 00:25:11,050
Shut up! I've had enough
of your damn flirting!

261
00:25:11,259 --> 00:25:13,594
What's gotten into you?!

262
00:25:28,485 --> 00:25:32,154
Tetsuo? It's time for your medication.

263
00:25:33,114 --> 00:25:36,075
Doctor! There's a problem!

264
00:25:39,788 --> 00:25:44,416
I can't. The dorm mother
throws a fit if you go out before 10.

265
00:25:44,626 --> 00:25:47,378
Yeah, the one with the face like a goat.

266
00:25:47,587 --> 00:25:51,423
That old bag's such a pain...
She's always yammering on and on and on.

267
00:25:51,633 --> 00:25:54,176
Tomorrow at three? Sure, that'd be okay.

268
00:25:54,386 --> 00:25:57,555
Hey, what happened
to that girl a while back?

269
00:25:57,764 --> 00:26:01,559
I don't like her much.
Her personality just gets on my nerves.

270
00:26:01,768 --> 00:26:03,519
Kaori...

271
00:26:05,272 --> 00:26:06,939
Tetsuo!

272
00:26:07,148 --> 00:26:11,860
Everyone's been worried about you!
They thought you might be dead.

273
00:26:18,034 --> 00:26:22,413
When I woke up, I was on an
operating table or something.

274
00:26:22,622 --> 00:26:24,623
And that examination...

275
00:26:24,833 --> 00:26:29,169
It's like... they were messing
around inside my head.

276
00:26:29,379 --> 00:26:31,839
I don't want to go back there.

277
00:26:32,048 --> 00:26:33,549
Let's run away...

278
00:26:33,758 --> 00:26:35,843
Where?

279
00:26:36,553 --> 00:26:41,307
Someplace. Someplace far away.

280
00:26:44,019 --> 00:26:45,811
...What's your problem?
... That's mine!

281
00:26:46,021 --> 00:26:46,895
I wanna get laid!

282
00:26:47,105 --> 00:26:48,897
Hey! Today's independent study!

283
00:26:49,107 --> 00:26:53,944
Say what? What about
my burning desire to study?!

284
00:26:54,154 --> 00:26:55,946
Drag his butt in here!

285
00:26:57,157 --> 00:26:58,907
Kaneda! Your bike!

286
00:26:59,117 --> 00:27:00,618
My bike?

287
00:27:01,953 --> 00:27:03,537
Look!

288
00:27:06,625 --> 00:27:08,208
Tetsuo!

289
00:27:10,295 --> 00:27:11,337
Are you sure this is okay?

290
00:27:11,546 --> 00:27:14,048
Shut up! Just keep quiet and hang on!

291
00:27:17,469 --> 00:27:23,349
"Off Limits"

292
00:27:25,101 --> 00:27:25,893
Huh?

293
00:27:26,102 --> 00:27:27,561
What's wrong?

294
00:27:29,648 --> 00:27:30,564
Shit!

295
00:27:30,774 --> 00:27:30,981
Oh, no...

296
00:27:31,524 --> 00:27:35,027
"End the Shimamoto
Labor Union's Illegal Strike!!"

297
00:27:35,236 --> 00:27:39,907
Oh, okay. The engine can't drop below
5,000 even when you're changing gears.

298
00:27:40,116 --> 00:27:42,409
...My butt hurts.
... Okay, I get it...

299
00:27:42,619 --> 00:27:43,994
Look, bikes!

300
00:27:45,163 --> 00:27:46,914
Is that Kaneda and...?

301
00:27:47,123 --> 00:27:49,833
It's not them!

302
00:27:52,462 --> 00:27:53,837
Kaori!

303
00:27:57,384 --> 00:27:58,592
Any sign of him?

304
00:27:58,802 --> 00:28:00,844
Kuwata and the others
went to look around Kisarazu.

305
00:28:01,054 --> 00:28:03,764
All that's left now is the industrial area!

306
00:28:03,973 --> 00:28:06,058
Okay, let's go!

307
00:28:08,770 --> 00:28:12,189
We owe you for the other night!

308
00:28:20,407 --> 00:28:21,949
Shut up!

309
00:28:24,744 --> 00:28:27,121
Kaori! What did they do, Kaori?!

310
00:28:33,795 --> 00:28:39,299
Don't! If you so much as scratch
that bike, I'm gonna kill you!

311
00:28:44,889 --> 00:28:45,931
Run!

312
00:28:46,141 --> 00:28:47,641
Don't let 'em get away!

313
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:55,816
Wait!

314
00:29:05,201 --> 00:29:06,994
Tetsuo!

315
00:29:13,168 --> 00:29:16,670
"Smash the Strike!!"

316
00:29:23,845 --> 00:29:26,054
That's enough, Tetsuo!
Are you trying to kill him?

317
00:29:26,264 --> 00:29:29,099
Yes! I'm gonna kill him!
I'll split his damn head open!

318
00:29:29,309 --> 00:29:30,893
Knock it off!

319
00:29:31,102 --> 00:29:34,980
This happened because
you took my bike for a joyride.

320
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:35,898
Enough, already!

321
00:29:36,107 --> 00:29:39,693
Shut up! Don't order me around!

322
00:29:39,903 --> 00:29:41,403
We were worried about you.

323
00:29:41,613 --> 00:29:45,324
Why do you always have
to come and save me?

324
00:29:45,533 --> 00:29:49,912
I could've handled it myself!
I admit I got beat up that one time,

325
00:29:50,121 --> 00:29:53,749
but I won't always be on the receiving end!

326
00:29:53,958 --> 00:29:56,168
Understand?!

327
00:30:00,048 --> 00:30:02,466
Tetsuo...

328
00:30:02,675 --> 00:30:04,927
Shut up! Stay away from me!

329
00:30:07,055 --> 00:30:10,557
Hey, wait! Where are you going?

330
00:30:10,767 --> 00:30:12,559
Leave me alone!

331
00:30:14,437 --> 00:30:15,562
Akira!

332
00:30:19,734 --> 00:30:20,984
Tetsuo!

333
00:30:24,072 --> 00:30:25,447
What's wrong?

334
00:30:26,157 --> 00:30:27,074
Akira!

335
00:30:27,283 --> 00:30:29,159
I don't know who that is!

336
00:30:51,641 --> 00:30:53,809
Tetsuo, are you...

337
00:30:54,018 --> 00:30:55,352
Hey!

338
00:30:59,774 --> 00:31:01,316
This is strange.

339
00:31:01,526 --> 00:31:04,403
I'm getting a blue pattern on scope #3!

340
00:31:04,612 --> 00:31:08,198
Oh, no! Retrieve the subject! Hurry!

341
00:31:21,504 --> 00:31:24,256
What're you doing to my friend?!

342
00:31:27,594 --> 00:31:31,805
What's with you?
You just come back from a funeral?

343
00:31:38,187 --> 00:31:39,521
Tetsuo!

344
00:31:39,731 --> 00:31:41,231
Kaneda!

345
00:31:42,483 --> 00:31:44,276
Shit...

346
00:31:53,369 --> 00:31:54,578
Wait!

347
00:32:01,461 --> 00:32:03,754
Hey, Kaneda...

348
00:32:14,891 --> 00:32:20,187
I see we have some youngsters doing
their thing in spite of the tight checkpoints.

349
00:32:20,396 --> 00:32:23,523
That just means that they're stupid, don't it?

350
00:32:27,236 --> 00:32:31,490
This is boring. Hey, let's go home.

351
00:32:31,699 --> 00:32:33,200
But it's still early!

352
00:32:33,409 --> 00:32:37,204
Yeah, but without their bikes
they're just skirt-chasers out of water.

353
00:32:37,413 --> 00:32:38,413
You mean "fish"!

354
00:32:38,623 --> 00:32:41,959
Come on, let's go. Let's toss these fish back!

355
00:32:42,168 --> 00:32:46,171
Hey, Kaneda, what're we gonna do?

356
00:32:48,299 --> 00:32:49,466
What the...?

357
00:32:49,676 --> 00:32:50,884
Look!

358
00:33:17,078 --> 00:33:18,412
That's...

359
00:33:18,621 --> 00:33:22,374
Here we go again... Let's get out
of here before we get involved again.

360
00:33:22,583 --> 00:33:24,334
Huh?

361
00:33:24,544 --> 00:33:25,460
Kaneda?

362
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:27,004
Hey!

363
00:33:28,297 --> 00:33:32,384
This area is being cordoned
off due to a terrorist bombing.

364
00:33:32,593 --> 00:33:34,344
Those who wish to get
through, line up in single file,

365
00:33:34,554 --> 00:33:38,515
present your ID and go through the checkpoint.

366
00:33:48,484 --> 00:33:49,693
Get in.

367
00:33:49,902 --> 00:33:53,864
What's wrong? Hurry. I'll be right behind you.

368
00:33:54,073 --> 00:33:56,074
You know the rendezvous point, right?

369
00:33:57,076 --> 00:34:00,454
...Be careful.
... You too, Ryu.

370
00:34:07,086 --> 00:34:09,379
"We're the Clowns"

371
00:34:13,551 --> 00:34:16,094
Stop! Stop, damn it!

372
00:34:17,930 --> 00:34:19,473
She's got a gun!

373
00:34:30,902 --> 00:34:32,986
Okay, that's far enough!

374
00:34:33,196 --> 00:34:34,529
Drop the gun!

375
00:34:41,871 --> 00:34:43,538
Drop it now!

376
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:51,129
Stop!

377
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:06,311
I think it came from over here!

378
00:35:06,521 --> 00:35:08,146
...There were two shots!
... No, three!

379
00:35:08,356 --> 00:35:09,898
It's just up ahead!

380
00:35:10,108 --> 00:35:12,734
Hey. Let's get out of here.

381
00:35:12,944 --> 00:35:14,194
Come on!

382
00:35:41,931 --> 00:35:47,769
"Idiot | Moron | Fool | No. 1 "

383
00:36:20,595 --> 00:36:21,970
Kaneda!

384
00:36:47,622 --> 00:36:51,583
So, what's the matter?
Try telling me about it.

385
00:36:51,792 --> 00:36:54,419
I had a dream.

386
00:36:54,629 --> 00:36:56,254
A dream?

387
00:36:57,798 --> 00:37:02,761
The city will be covered by a
dark shadow and start to crumble.

388
00:37:02,970 --> 00:37:05,347
Lots of people died...

389
00:37:05,556 --> 00:37:09,726
...and we met Akira again.

390
00:37:09,936 --> 00:37:11,102
Akira?!

391
00:37:11,312 --> 00:37:18,276
The city will crumble,
and so many people will die...

392
00:37:18,486 --> 00:37:22,197
When?! When will it happen, Kiyoko?!

393
00:37:22,406 --> 00:37:25,242
You mustn't let that boy go.

394
00:37:25,451 --> 00:37:28,662
His power, it...

395
00:37:35,002 --> 00:37:35,919
What did she mean?!

396
00:37:36,128 --> 00:37:41,883
Well, there's nothing
physically wrong with her.

397
00:37:42,093 --> 00:37:43,385
Her medication is normal. too.

398
00:37:43,594 --> 00:37:48,056
There's no sign of any abnormalities
in her ECG or EEG, either.

399
00:37:48,266 --> 00:37:53,770
I think what Number 25 said
was her precognitive power at work.

400
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:58,650
This must be presented to the
supreme executive council for inquiry, but...

401
00:37:58,859 --> 00:38:00,527
Do you believe her?

402
00:38:00,736 --> 00:38:02,988
I have no doubts
regarding Number 25's abilities.

403
00:38:03,197 --> 00:38:05,907
We have all sorts of data
that substantiate her abilities.

404
00:38:06,117 --> 00:38:08,618
What about you, Colonel?

405
00:38:08,828 --> 00:38:13,206
My job isn't to believe or disbelieve.
It's to act or not to act.

406
00:38:25,886 --> 00:38:26,845
Here, sir.

407
00:38:27,054 --> 00:38:31,266
Cold gear, Colonel.
Please put it on. You, too, Doctor.

408
00:38:42,611 --> 00:38:47,198
The other day, a young
researcher asked me something.

409
00:38:47,408 --> 00:38:51,369
He wondered if their power was the form
the next stage of human evolution was taking,

410
00:38:51,579 --> 00:38:56,958
and perhaps that we'll all
be able to control it someday.

411
00:38:57,168 --> 00:38:59,919
Scientists are a bunch of romantics.

412
00:39:00,129 --> 00:39:03,089
Military men always consider the risks first.

413
00:39:03,299 --> 00:39:05,717
It's taken thirty long years.

414
00:39:05,926 --> 00:39:09,763
We've come so far from the rubble.

415
00:39:09,972 --> 00:39:11,931
We can't just trade one for the other.

416
00:39:12,141 --> 00:39:16,728
I've always thought that
you hated this city, Colonel.

417
00:39:16,937 --> 00:39:22,192
The passion to build has cooled
and the joy of reconstruction forgotten,

418
00:39:22,401 --> 00:39:26,154
and now it's just a garbage heap
made up of hedonistic fools.

419
00:39:26,364 --> 00:39:30,075
So you're trying to save the city, then.

420
00:39:30,284 --> 00:39:33,620
It's how a soldier thinks.
A scientist wouldn't understand.

421
00:39:37,541 --> 00:39:39,584
Colonel, we're here.

422
00:39:39,794 --> 00:39:40,877
This way, sir.

423
00:40:01,273 --> 00:40:04,818
Room 10, 148 degrees Kelvin.

424
00:40:05,027 --> 00:40:07,570
Fluctuation tolerance range, check.

425
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:12,158
Room 9, 118 degrees Kelvin.
Fluctuation tolerance, check.

426
00:40:12,368 --> 00:40:15,036
Emergency power generator, check.

427
00:40:15,246 --> 00:40:16,079
Open it.

428
00:40:16,288 --> 00:40:17,497
Yes, sir.

429
00:40:17,706 --> 00:40:17,997
Uh...

430
00:40:18,207 --> 00:40:19,332
Go to the Control Room!

431
00:40:19,542 --> 00:40:20,750
Yes, sir!

432
00:40:37,476 --> 00:40:43,314
Room 1 is at 0.0005 degrees Kelvin.
It's within tolerances.

433
00:40:43,524 --> 00:40:48,403
No abnormalities detected in any of the
rooms' Dewar Walls or in the defense system.

434
00:40:48,612 --> 00:40:52,240
No abnormal atmospheric
concentrations or reactions recorded.

435
00:40:52,450 --> 00:40:55,201
All systems nominal, then?

436
00:41:04,211 --> 00:41:07,422
Look at what they abandoned
in their panic. They were afraid!

437
00:41:07,631 --> 00:41:09,966
They were too scared,
so they hid it away from the public.

438
00:41:10,176 --> 00:41:12,385
They forgot all shame and honor

439
00:41:12,595 --> 00:41:16,931
and cast off the civilization
and science we had created,

440
00:41:17,141 --> 00:41:21,686
and shut the lid of the Pandora's Box
they themselves had opened.

441
00:41:26,192 --> 00:41:26,733
Ryu!

442
00:41:26,942 --> 00:41:29,068
Hey, we're still young.

443
00:41:29,278 --> 00:41:31,738
I think we can start over.

444
00:41:31,947 --> 00:41:33,156
I'll go with you to the police.

445
00:41:33,365 --> 00:41:34,115
Ryu!

446
00:41:34,325 --> 00:41:35,742
Come on, turn yourself in!

447
00:41:35,951 --> 00:41:37,994
That was the first time you
ever killed somebody, right?

448
00:41:38,204 --> 00:41:38,661
Ryu!

449
00:41:38,871 --> 00:41:41,623
Anyway, once you've
purified your body and soul,

450
00:41:41,832 --> 00:41:44,000
let's go out for tea or something.

451
00:41:44,210 --> 00:41:46,169
Don't kick yourself over it, okay?

452
00:41:46,378 --> 00:41:50,340
What's done is done. The guy's dead.

453
00:41:57,264 --> 00:41:59,432
Who're you?!

454
00:41:59,642 --> 00:42:02,143
Ryu! You're okay!

455
00:42:02,353 --> 00:42:04,771
...Kei, is that you?
... Ryu!

456
00:42:05,272 --> 00:42:07,232
Who's this?

457
00:42:07,441 --> 00:42:08,775
Who, me?

458
00:42:08,984 --> 00:42:14,948
Well, I guess saying I'm Kei's
boyfriend might be stretching it a bit.

459
00:42:15,157 --> 00:42:18,535
But we haven't gotten physical
or anything yet, understand?

460
00:42:18,744 --> 00:42:19,619
...Are you a spy?!
... No!

461
00:42:19,828 --> 00:42:21,496
Liar!

462
00:42:25,793 --> 00:42:27,293
Is he really okay?

463
00:42:27,503 --> 00:42:30,880
All I know for sure is that he's not a spy.

464
00:42:31,090 --> 00:42:32,882
Ow...

465
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:36,261
Sneak into their lab?!

466
00:42:36,470 --> 00:42:38,888
Are you serious? Don't you
remember the fiasco with that kid?!

467
00:42:39,098 --> 00:42:43,017
Last-minute orders.
Besides, the plan's already in place.

468
00:42:45,729 --> 00:42:48,481
The lab passes that they issue once a week...

469
00:42:48,691 --> 00:42:50,525
They're from Mr. Nezu?

470
00:42:50,734 --> 00:42:51,985
What's the objective?

471
00:42:52,194 --> 00:42:54,779
Detailed data on the new subject.

472
00:42:54,989 --> 00:42:56,406
New subject?

473
00:42:56,615 --> 00:43:03,580
Yes. Last week, on the night we tried
to abduct the subject called Number 26,

474
00:43:03,789 --> 00:43:08,418
a boy who was in an accident on an
old city highway was brought to the lab.

475
00:43:08,627 --> 00:43:11,045
Looks like he's a student
at a vocational training school.

476
00:43:11,255 --> 00:43:14,757
but he's now their new subject
for human experimentation.

477
00:43:18,596 --> 00:43:19,637
Ow!

478
00:43:19,847 --> 00:43:23,224
Ow! What's the big idea?!

479
00:43:23,434 --> 00:43:24,225
You!

480
00:43:24,435 --> 00:43:25,810
He heard us! Let's kill him!

481
00:43:26,020 --> 00:43:26,561
Ryu!

482
00:43:26,770 --> 00:43:30,607
W- Wait a minute! Listen to me!
Listen to what I have to say!

483
00:43:30,816 --> 00:43:31,733
He saved me!

484
00:43:31,942 --> 00:43:33,067
Twice!

485
00:43:33,277 --> 00:43:35,153
Maybe it was just to get close to us.

486
00:43:35,362 --> 00:43:38,740
The guy who was in that accident
in the old city is a friend of mine!

487
00:43:38,949 --> 00:43:41,909
I know it's hard to believe, but it's the truth!

488
00:43:42,119 --> 00:43:44,704
I was there when it happened!

489
00:43:44,913 --> 00:43:48,750
Don't they say the only foolish
questions are unasked ones?

490
00:43:48,959 --> 00:43:51,794
Huh? They don't?

491
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:55,882
That's an intriguing story.

492
00:43:56,091 --> 00:43:58,885
Will you be taking the boy with you?

493
00:43:59,094 --> 00:44:03,640
He knows the subject, and I think
we can use him as a decoy if necessary.

494
00:44:03,849 --> 00:44:07,393
Neo Tokyo is going to change.

495
00:44:07,811 --> 00:44:12,857
In all respects, this city is
saturated. It's like an overripe fruit.

496
00:44:13,067 --> 00:44:15,693
And within it is a new seed.

497
00:44:15,903 --> 00:44:19,864
We only need to wait for
the wind which will make it fall.

498
00:44:20,074 --> 00:44:23,034
The wind called Akira!

499
00:44:23,243 --> 00:44:26,412
Ryu, look!

500
00:44:26,914 --> 00:44:27,789
What is it?

501
00:44:27,998 --> 00:44:30,500
We aren't the ones who will change it,

502
00:44:30,709 --> 00:44:34,712
but rather, those citizens
who hope for Akira will.

503
00:44:34,922 --> 00:44:38,549
That which is called
science perverts providence!

504
00:44:38,759 --> 00:44:41,302
That which is called progress
encourages extravagance!

505
00:44:41,970 --> 00:44:46,516
That which is called civilization
devastates the spirit of man!

506
00:44:46,725 --> 00:44:51,145
The time of atonement is upon us!

507
00:44:52,773 --> 00:44:56,150
"Lord Akira the Enlightened"

508
00:44:56,360 --> 00:44:59,529
"Lord Akira the Enlightened"

509
00:44:59,738 --> 00:45:02,115
"Lord Akira the Enlightened"

510
00:45:02,324 --> 00:45:04,200
Break up this illegal gathering!

511
00:45:05,077 --> 00:45:07,286
Terrorist activities carried out by

512
00:45:07,496 --> 00:45:10,915
anti-government elements
have skyrocketed this month.

513
00:45:11,125 --> 00:45:15,169
The army, riot police, and even
traffic police have been fully mobilized.

514
00:45:15,379 --> 00:45:18,589
The overtime costs alone have
used up the public safety budget.

515
00:45:18,799 --> 00:45:21,008
And then there's the abduction of Number 26!

516
00:45:21,218 --> 00:45:24,220
Isn't their existence supposed
to be highest of state secrets?

517
00:45:24,430 --> 00:45:27,807
No one's ever heard of "Peace
and Order" here in Neo Tokyo, then?

518
00:45:28,016 --> 00:45:31,394
And then there's this request of yours

519
00:45:31,603 --> 00:45:36,441
for further funding because
of subject Number 25's prediction.

520
00:45:36,650 --> 00:45:38,025
You must be joking!

521
00:45:38,235 --> 00:45:43,322
We Parliament members have been
begging the public to bear with us

522
00:45:43,532 --> 00:45:48,619
while we straighten out the former
Prime Minister's historic tax reform blunders,

523
00:45:48,829 --> 00:45:51,748
so where, exactly, are we
supposed to get that kind of money?!

524
00:45:51,957 --> 00:45:56,461
You've spent a fortune, and all we have to
show for it is that grotesque kindergarten!

525
00:45:56,670 --> 00:45:59,088
The Olympics are next year.
The postwar period is over.

526
00:45:59,298 --> 00:46:02,759
How much longer will you keep
spending money on some ghost?!

527
00:46:02,968 --> 00:46:05,970
I always said that we should've put
that money into the welfare program!

528
00:46:06,180 --> 00:46:07,138
Shut up, old man!

529
00:46:07,347 --> 00:46:08,139
What?!

530
00:46:08,348 --> 00:46:12,018
That power is starting to
walk around free as we speak.

531
00:46:12,227 --> 00:46:17,607
...Unless we control it now, we'll lose everything!
... Who do you think you're talking to, youngster?

532
00:46:17,816 --> 00:46:20,651
It was your lack of policy that
started this mess in the first place!

533
00:46:20,861 --> 00:46:25,281
There's still no proof that the
last World War was caused by Akira!

534
00:46:25,491 --> 00:46:29,410
Won't you even try to
understand anything at all

535
00:46:29,620 --> 00:46:31,412
unless an Akira disaster actually happens?!

536
00:46:31,622 --> 00:46:33,998
Has anyone actually seen this "Akira"?

537
00:46:34,208 --> 00:46:36,292
Wasn't Akira Number 25?

538
00:46:36,502 --> 00:46:38,586
No, I think he was Number 21...

539
00:46:38,796 --> 00:46:42,507
The Colonel has lost
sight of his duty as a soldier.

540
00:46:42,716 --> 00:46:44,842
I've had reports that
anti-government elements are using

541
00:46:45,052 --> 00:46:50,723
this "Akira" madness of yours as an
excuse to whip up their terrorist fervor!

542
00:46:50,933 --> 00:46:52,850
No! That's untrue!

543
00:46:53,060 --> 00:46:55,478
Then what about that
Akira world renewal movement?

544
00:46:55,687 --> 00:46:57,563
Wouldn't you say that
information's being leaked?

545
00:46:57,773 --> 00:47:01,067
World renewal movement?
End of the world, more like!

546
00:47:01,276 --> 00:47:04,946
Aren't you just using Akira as
camouflage to cover up your misconduct?

547
00:47:05,155 --> 00:47:06,781
What are you getting at?

548
00:47:06,990 --> 00:47:15,498
Colonel, we can no longer leave the
peace of Neo Tokyo to your sole discretion.

549
00:47:15,707 --> 00:47:16,457
Right!

550
00:47:16,667 --> 00:47:19,877
You are to be put before an inquiry committee.

551
00:47:20,087 --> 00:47:21,337
I agree!

552
00:47:25,092 --> 00:47:26,509
Excuse me!

553
00:47:26,927 --> 00:47:28,845
Colonel! Colonel, where are you...

554
00:47:29,054 --> 00:47:31,514
Wait! This discussion isn't over yet!

555
00:47:31,723 --> 00:47:32,807
Explain yourself!

556
00:47:33,016 --> 00:47:36,060
Are you trying to insult the
supreme executive council?!

557
00:47:36,270 --> 00:47:37,019
Colonel...!

558
00:47:37,229 --> 00:47:38,855
Wait, Colonel!

559
00:48:00,711 --> 00:48:03,045
W- Water...

560
00:48:35,329 --> 00:48:37,413
Hey, wait a minute...

561
00:48:37,623 --> 00:48:41,042
Isn't that cable replacement
scheduled for next week?

562
00:48:41,251 --> 00:48:44,587
The cable they ordered came in early.

563
00:48:44,796 --> 00:48:47,214
Besides, I'm going on vacation
at the end of the week.

564
00:48:48,926 --> 00:48:49,133
"Verify Pass Cards"

565
00:48:49,134 --> 00:48:52,094
I've brought some workers with me, too.

566
00:48:52,304 --> 00:48:57,266
I could take it back, but the
work's gonna be done sooner or later.

567
00:49:01,980 --> 00:49:04,273
Okay, let's go.

568
00:50:34,156 --> 00:50:35,573
What the...?

569
00:51:05,103 --> 00:51:06,395
Milk?

570
00:51:14,571 --> 00:51:16,322
Stay away!

571
00:51:29,252 --> 00:51:29,877
Blood!

572
00:51:30,087 --> 00:51:31,462
I'm scared!

573
00:51:40,222 --> 00:51:42,014
Jerk!

574
00:51:42,224 --> 00:51:44,350
W- Who the hell are they?

575
00:52:39,906 --> 00:52:43,534
Room 887, Tetsuo Shima...

576
00:52:43,743 --> 00:52:45,661
A problem with the automatic lock?

577
00:52:50,917 --> 00:52:54,336
Hey! You can't just walk off from your room!

578
00:52:58,967 --> 00:53:00,342
Come on, let's go back.

579
00:53:00,552 --> 00:53:03,679
What the hell happened? What a mess!

580
00:53:26,453 --> 00:53:30,331
There are 58 blocks with circuits
that the computer won't display.

581
00:53:30,540 --> 00:53:34,877
Of those, nearly 40 are concentrated
on underground levels 7 and 8.

582
00:53:35,086 --> 00:53:36,462
That's probably the place.

583
00:53:38,548 --> 00:53:41,008
The central wiring shaft should be up ahead.

584
00:53:41,218 --> 00:53:43,844
We should be able to use it
to go straight to the sublevels.

585
00:53:45,263 --> 00:53:48,349
Be careful. It's deeper in the middle.

586
00:53:48,558 --> 00:53:49,934
What a stink!

587
00:53:50,143 --> 00:53:50,809
Quiet!

588
00:53:51,019 --> 00:53:54,021
What? I said it stinks because it stinks!

589
00:53:54,231 --> 00:53:56,941
...Is your nose busted?
... Hurry up and stay quiet!

590
00:53:58,526 --> 00:54:00,986
Damn! Hide!

591
00:54:01,196 --> 00:54:02,404
Huh? Where?

592
00:54:02,614 --> 00:54:04,782
What're you doing, you idiot?!

593
00:54:18,588 --> 00:54:20,047
They left?

594
00:54:20,257 --> 00:54:21,715
Looks like they've beefed up security.

595
00:54:21,925 --> 00:54:23,467
Must be that siren we heard.

596
00:54:23,677 --> 00:54:24,927
What should we do? Scout around some?

597
00:54:25,136 --> 00:54:26,428
No.

598
00:54:26,638 --> 00:54:27,680
...Are you okay?
... Let's keep going.

599
00:54:27,889 --> 00:54:30,182
I want to check out their
security at the very least.

600
00:54:30,392 --> 00:54:31,350
All right.

601
00:54:31,559 --> 00:54:34,228
We've been spotted! Run!

602
00:54:34,437 --> 00:54:35,521
Shit!

603
00:54:35,730 --> 00:54:38,649
Don't! Don't shoot!

604
00:54:41,236 --> 00:54:44,947
Shimazaki! Shit!

605
00:54:45,156 --> 00:54:46,991
Forget about him! Run!

606
00:54:50,704 --> 00:54:52,788
What the hell is that?

607
00:54:53,790 --> 00:54:55,124
Here it comes!

608
00:54:55,959 --> 00:54:58,168
Forget it! You can't do any good!

609
00:55:02,966 --> 00:55:04,800
Die!

610
00:55:05,719 --> 00:55:07,177
This is Unit 304, Shaft H!

611
00:55:07,387 --> 00:55:11,223
I have encountered intruders
and am engaging! Request backup!

612
00:55:11,766 --> 00:55:13,100
Here it comes!

613
00:55:39,252 --> 00:55:40,502
Kei!

614
00:55:43,173 --> 00:55:44,506
Where's that gun?!

615
00:55:45,008 --> 00:55:47,051
Damn it...!

616
00:55:49,304 --> 00:55:50,763
Kaneda!

617
00:56:00,732 --> 00:56:02,566
Kei, this way!

618
00:56:03,485 --> 00:56:06,528
Hurry!

619
00:56:06,738 --> 00:56:09,198
Kaneda, hurry!

620
00:56:24,214 --> 00:56:25,964
Kaneda!

621
00:56:38,686 --> 00:56:40,687
The brakes! Where are the brakes?!

622
00:56:40,897 --> 00:56:41,939
That's not it?

623
00:56:42,148 --> 00:56:43,941
This is the central wiring shaft!

624
00:56:44,150 --> 00:56:45,859
It's gotta be this one, then!

625
00:56:51,991 --> 00:56:54,785
Okay, I'm getting the hang of this!

626
00:56:54,994 --> 00:56:57,079
Ask the Colonel for clearance to fire!

627
00:56:57,288 --> 00:56:59,206
Turn that up!

628
00:56:59,416 --> 00:57:00,707
There must be some mistake.

629
00:57:00,917 --> 00:57:03,419
That boy looks like the
patient they admitted to the lab.

630
00:57:03,628 --> 00:57:06,797
The boy, the subject named
Tetsuo Shima, broke out of his room.

631
00:57:07,006 --> 00:57:08,841
I think he's headed for the Baby Room.

632
00:57:09,050 --> 00:57:10,008
Tetsuo?!

633
00:57:10,218 --> 00:57:12,928
He is in an extremely dangerous
state! Don't let him through!

634
00:57:13,138 --> 00:57:15,931
I repeat, do not let him through!

635
00:57:43,960 --> 00:57:45,127
What the...?

636
00:57:52,719 --> 00:57:54,344
It's no use hiding.

637
00:57:54,554 --> 00:57:56,513
We have no choice, then. Use your guns!

638
00:57:56,723 --> 00:58:00,058
We can't let him go any
farther, no matter what it takes!

639
00:58:01,060 --> 00:58:02,728
Fire!

640
00:58:42,060 --> 00:58:44,686
So, here you are...

641
00:58:49,901 --> 00:58:51,401
Stop it!

642
00:58:53,404 --> 00:58:56,323
How long are you
gonna keep playing around?!

643
00:59:03,122 --> 00:59:05,290
Where'd the other one go?

644
00:59:06,584 --> 00:59:08,126
Why, you...

645
00:59:09,337 --> 00:59:10,837
Die!

646
00:59:13,216 --> 00:59:14,800
Takashi!

647
00:59:24,894 --> 00:59:30,023
What the hell is going on?
Am I dreaming or something?

648
00:59:30,233 --> 00:59:33,735
I never knew I had powers like this!

649
00:59:40,660 --> 00:59:43,036
Damn it, which way should I go?!

650
00:59:43,246 --> 00:59:46,665
Straight. Straight ahead...

651
00:59:46,874 --> 00:59:47,749
Huh?

652
00:59:47,959 --> 00:59:50,711
There's a freight elevator.

653
00:59:52,005 --> 00:59:55,007
We can take it to sublevel 8.

654
01:00:03,141 --> 01:00:05,851
Good, you're all together.

655
01:00:07,312 --> 01:00:10,230
You thought you could kill me?

656
01:00:10,982 --> 01:00:15,485
You tried to mess with me...
I'm gonna kill you!

657
01:00:20,825 --> 01:00:23,035
That was you...

658
01:00:23,244 --> 01:00:24,494
Takashi!

659
01:00:24,704 --> 01:00:26,538
Attack him together!

660
01:00:26,748 --> 01:00:28,832
O- Okay.

661
01:00:33,212 --> 01:00:35,005
You little twerps!

662
01:00:51,564 --> 01:00:53,357
That's enough! All of you!

663
01:01:01,574 --> 01:01:03,617
Who the hell are you?!

664
01:01:07,038 --> 01:01:10,207
What's the matter?
Does your head hurt, Tetsuo Shima?

665
01:01:10,416 --> 01:01:12,209
Your power isn't fully matured.

666
01:01:12,418 --> 01:01:14,544
If you push yourself,
you might do irreparable damage.

667
01:01:14,754 --> 01:01:16,713
Just do as we tell you.

668
01:01:16,923 --> 01:01:21,968
What the hell did you people do to my head?!

669
01:01:30,144 --> 01:01:32,145
Calm yourself, Tetsuo Shima!

670
01:01:32,355 --> 01:01:34,481
He can't control it.

671
01:01:39,487 --> 01:01:40,362
What?!

672
01:01:40,571 --> 01:01:46,118
She said that big people like you
should never use the power like that.

673
01:01:46,327 --> 01:01:48,704
She says something horrible will happen.

674
01:01:48,913 --> 01:01:50,997
Mind your own business.

675
01:01:53,376 --> 01:01:56,962
What? More powerful than me?

676
01:01:59,215 --> 01:02:04,177
He's the one! He's been popping
in and out of my head lately!

677
01:02:04,387 --> 01:02:07,139
Where is he?! Where's this "Akira"?!

678
01:02:07,348 --> 01:02:07,681
What?!

679
01:02:07,890 --> 01:02:12,018
Kiyoko said that you'll awaken Akira.

680
01:02:12,228 --> 01:02:14,980
If that happens, no one
will be able to stop him.

681
01:02:15,189 --> 01:02:16,732
So before that can happen,
we have to stop you.

682
01:02:16,941 --> 01:02:18,692
Impossible! Akira's already...

683
01:02:18,901 --> 01:02:21,987
Where is he?!

684
01:02:23,030 --> 01:02:24,156
Stop it!

685
01:02:24,365 --> 01:02:25,949
Shut up!

686
01:02:31,414 --> 01:02:35,041
Threat level to facility
integrity has passed level 7.

687
01:02:35,251 --> 01:02:39,212
Enacting disaster protocols.

688
01:02:39,422 --> 01:02:42,799
Threat level to facility
integrity has passed level 7.

689
01:02:43,009 --> 01:02:46,094
Enacting disaster protocols.

690
01:02:46,304 --> 01:02:47,763
What the...?!

691
01:02:55,021 --> 01:02:56,605
Hands up!

692
01:02:59,567 --> 01:03:01,818
Where the hell is the "Baby Room"?!

693
01:03:13,915 --> 01:03:15,665
Oh, no! Run!

694
01:03:20,588 --> 01:03:22,714
Gangway, coming through! Coming through!

695
01:03:22,924 --> 01:03:24,591
Damn it, move!

696
01:03:26,511 --> 01:03:28,053
Kiyoko...

697
01:03:47,698 --> 01:03:49,449
Damn, that hurt...

698
01:03:49,659 --> 01:03:53,578
Kaneda? What're you doing here?

699
01:03:56,040 --> 01:03:59,584
Tetsuo! Are you okay?
I'm here to rescue you!

700
01:04:01,420 --> 01:04:05,799
Hurry up, you moron! If we don't get
out of here, those guys outside are gonna...

701
01:04:07,218 --> 01:04:09,928
There he is! Catch him!

702
01:04:11,889 --> 01:04:14,391
Stay away from me!

703
01:04:18,062 --> 01:04:19,604
Kaneda!

704
01:04:21,816 --> 01:04:26,069
Oh, right. I forgot you were there, Kaneda.

705
01:04:26,279 --> 01:04:28,280
That's okay, Kaneda.

706
01:04:28,489 --> 01:04:32,868
I won't be needing you to save me anymore.

707
01:04:33,077 --> 01:04:35,787
From now on, I'll be saving you.

708
01:04:35,997 --> 01:04:39,082
All you have to do is ask, Kanny.

709
01:04:39,292 --> 01:04:44,337
Say what? Who the hell do
you think you're talking to?!

710
01:04:45,089 --> 01:04:47,716
You don't like the way I talk?

711
01:04:47,925 --> 01:04:49,301
Does it make you mad?

712
01:04:49,510 --> 01:04:51,011
Well, what're you gonna do about it?!

713
01:04:51,220 --> 01:04:55,432
Huh, Kaneda?! What're
you gonna do about it?!

714
01:05:04,483 --> 01:05:09,863
That's enough! Don't hurt anyone else!

715
01:05:11,324 --> 01:05:13,783
Where's this "Akira" guy?!

716
01:05:13,993 --> 01:05:15,994
He...

717
01:05:16,203 --> 01:05:19,331
The Olympic stadium...?
In an underground facility?

718
01:05:19,540 --> 01:05:23,126
No! You're wrong! Akira is...

719
01:05:24,795 --> 01:05:26,588
Wait!

720
01:05:35,890 --> 01:05:40,560
What the hell? I can do this, too?!

721
01:05:46,400 --> 01:05:48,318
Kiyoko, are you okay?

722
01:05:48,527 --> 01:05:50,236
It doesn't look like she's hurt.

723
01:05:50,446 --> 01:05:53,031
What about you, Masaru? You're bleeding.

724
01:05:53,240 --> 01:05:55,200
What happened to him?

725
01:05:55,409 --> 01:05:56,493
He flew away.

726
01:05:56,702 --> 01:05:59,329
How can he have so much power...?

727
01:06:01,499 --> 01:06:05,210
How could this have
happened? Is anyone here?

728
01:06:05,419 --> 01:06:09,005
He's developed so much
power in such a short time...

729
01:06:09,215 --> 01:06:11,257
Find him! Find Tetsuo!

730
01:06:11,467 --> 01:06:14,719
...Find him! Go after him!
... Kaneda! Hang on, Kaneda!

731
01:06:14,929 --> 01:06:17,889
Hurry up! Get that rubble cleared!

732
01:06:19,892 --> 01:06:21,518
He went to where Akira is.

733
01:06:21,727 --> 01:06:25,522
What? You're all safe!

734
01:06:25,731 --> 01:06:29,317
He's heading for the facility
below the Olympic construction site.

735
01:06:29,527 --> 01:06:31,528
How did Tetsuo find out about that?!

736
01:06:35,408 --> 01:06:39,077
You mean he's gone outside?

737
01:06:41,372 --> 01:06:44,791
Damn it! We'll follow him! Prepare for pursuit!

738
01:06:45,001 --> 01:06:46,209
...Yes, sir!
... He's heading west!

739
01:06:46,419 --> 01:06:48,962
He's heading for the
Olympic construction site!

740
01:06:49,171 --> 01:06:51,798
Tell them to beef up their security!

741
01:06:52,008 --> 01:06:54,009
...You...!
... Set up checkpoints on all...

742
01:07:00,224 --> 01:07:04,477
According to the defense team, intruders
were encountered in the wiring shaft.

743
01:07:04,687 --> 01:07:06,563
...Two disguised as workers resisted
and were shot, and the rest are at large.

744
01:07:06,564 --> 01:07:10,775
...He has to be stopped before his powers mature... Two disguised
as workers resisted and were shot, and the rest are at large.

745
01:07:11,819 --> 01:07:14,529
Your objective is the boy Tetsuo Shima.

746
01:07:14,739 --> 01:07:17,991
If we are unable to capture him, you will
lure him out to the old city and attack.

747
01:07:18,200 --> 01:07:20,452
Request assistance from
the Eastern District Battalion.

748
01:07:20,661 --> 01:07:20,952
Yes, sir!

749
01:07:21,162 --> 01:07:23,371
Tell them there isn't a moment to lose!

750
01:07:25,708 --> 01:07:28,001
I've been waiting for you, Colonel.

751
01:07:29,086 --> 01:07:30,754
Who the hell are you?!

752
01:07:32,423 --> 01:07:36,593
I'm here to inform you of the
supreme executive council's decision.

753
01:07:38,387 --> 01:07:42,515
At 2400 hours today, the Colonel is
hereby stripped of his command and rank,

754
01:07:42,725 --> 01:07:44,934
and will be placed under arrest.

755
01:07:45,144 --> 01:07:46,561
What?!

756
01:07:47,313 --> 01:07:49,647
Please come with us.

757
01:07:49,857 --> 01:07:54,152
You expect me to hand Neo Tokyo
over to those fools at a time like this?

758
01:07:56,947 --> 01:07:58,198
...Shoot him.
... Yes, sir!

759
01:07:58,407 --> 01:08:00,200
What?

760
01:08:00,409 --> 01:08:02,118
W- Wait!

761
01:08:03,370 --> 01:08:07,123
Enough! Open your eyes
and look at the big picture!

762
01:08:07,333 --> 01:08:10,627
We can't dance to the tune of
corrupt politicians and capitalists!

763
01:08:14,673 --> 01:08:18,343
Don't you understand?!
It's pointless to fight anymore!

764
01:08:22,473 --> 01:08:26,684
Announce a state of emergency,
arrest all members of the executive council

765
01:08:26,894 --> 01:08:29,479
and remove them from
the chain of command!

766
01:08:29,688 --> 01:08:31,356
We're going after Tetsuo!

767
01:08:31,565 --> 01:08:35,568
Urgent message to all
district battalion commanders!

768
01:08:40,699 --> 01:08:44,035
"Haruki-ya"

769
01:08:45,204 --> 01:08:49,249
Hey, what's up? You by yourself?

770
01:08:51,210 --> 01:08:53,545
Weren't you in an accident or something?

771
01:08:53,754 --> 01:08:57,090
Everybody's been worried.
So, you feeling better?

772
01:08:57,299 --> 01:09:00,844
Gimme some... capsules.

773
01:09:01,053 --> 01:09:04,597
Hey, are you sure about that?
You don't look so hot.

774
01:09:04,807 --> 01:09:07,809
Just hand 'em over!

775
01:09:08,018 --> 01:09:09,894
All right, if you say so.

776
01:09:10,104 --> 01:09:14,232
But with all those demonstrations and
terrorist attacks lately, things are rough.

777
01:09:14,441 --> 01:09:18,611
They're hard to come by,
so they're pretty expensive.

778
01:09:24,827 --> 01:09:29,372
Tetsuo's run off, Kaneda's disappeared...
I guess the team's finished.

779
01:09:29,582 --> 01:09:35,128
And the checkpoints are so strict,
even the Clowns are staying put.

780
01:09:44,388 --> 01:09:45,805
What's wrong?

781
01:09:46,390 --> 01:09:47,557
"This End Up"

782
01:09:49,310 --> 01:09:50,226
He's dead!

783
01:09:50,436 --> 01:09:51,811
What?!

784
01:09:53,898 --> 01:09:55,481
What the...?

785
01:10:00,738 --> 01:10:01,863
Tetsuo?

786
01:10:02,072 --> 01:10:06,701
What are you doing here?

787
01:10:06,911 --> 01:10:09,537
You want some, too?

788
01:10:09,747 --> 01:10:13,166
What are you talking about, damn it?!
What the hell happened here?!

789
01:10:13,375 --> 01:10:15,752
The barkeep's dead!

790
01:10:18,964 --> 01:10:21,799
A fish out of water dies, huh?

791
01:10:22,009 --> 01:10:27,931
You are Tetsuo... Aren't you?

792
01:10:28,140 --> 01:10:30,183
Kaneda sends his regards.

793
01:10:30,392 --> 01:10:31,684
You saw Kaneda?!

794
01:10:31,894 --> 01:10:34,979
He's probably dead by now...

795
01:10:37,608 --> 01:10:41,027
You did this, Tetsuo?

796
01:10:41,237 --> 01:10:45,573
So anyway... Where's Kaneda's bike?

797
01:10:45,783 --> 01:10:46,950
Tetsuo!

798
01:10:48,077 --> 01:10:50,078
I don't need a piece of
junk like that anymore...

799
01:10:50,287 --> 01:10:51,704
You son of a...

800
01:10:57,419 --> 01:10:58,878
Yamagata!

801
01:11:05,386 --> 01:11:07,303
Shit...

802
01:11:14,228 --> 01:11:15,937
He went to where Akira is?

803
01:11:16,146 --> 01:11:18,147
That's what that girl said.

804
01:11:18,357 --> 01:11:22,568
The army, you, and Ryu are
all looking for this "Akira" guy,

805
01:11:22,778 --> 01:11:24,862
so that's why you're chasing after Tetsuo.

806
01:11:25,072 --> 01:11:29,158
It has something to do with
that power of Tetsuo's, right?

807
01:11:29,368 --> 01:11:31,911
What the hell is this "Akira"
thing you keep talking about?

808
01:11:34,581 --> 01:11:39,377
Ryu told me about it once.
He said that Akira is absolute energy.

809
01:11:39,586 --> 01:11:41,421
Absolute energy?

810
01:11:41,630 --> 01:11:45,425
Humans do all kinds of
things during their lifetime, right?

811
01:11:45,634 --> 01:11:49,887
Discovering things, building things...

812
01:11:50,556 --> 01:11:57,603
Things like houses, motorcycles,
bridges, cities, and rockets...

813
01:11:58,188 --> 01:12:01,774
All that knowledge and energy...
Where do you suppose it comes from?

814
01:12:03,360 --> 01:12:06,779
Humans were like monkeys once, right?

815
01:12:06,989 --> 01:12:10,491
And before that, like reptiles and fish.

816
01:12:10,701 --> 01:12:14,620
And before that, plankton and amoebas.

817
01:12:14,830 --> 01:12:19,042
Even creatures like those have
incredible energy inside them.

818
01:12:19,251 --> 01:12:22,503
Because of genes, I guess.

819
01:12:22,713 --> 01:12:27,633
And even before that, maybe
there were genes in the water and air.

820
01:12:27,843 --> 01:12:30,219
Even in space dust, too, I bet.

821
01:12:30,429 --> 01:12:34,682
If that's true, what
memories are hidden in it?

822
01:12:34,892 --> 01:12:38,519
The beginning of the universe, maybe.
Or maybe even before that.

823
01:12:38,729 --> 01:12:42,523
Hey, what's the matter? Are you okay?

824
01:12:42,733 --> 01:12:45,068
Did you get hit on the head back there?

825
01:12:45,277 --> 01:12:48,863
Maybe everyone has those memories.

826
01:12:49,073 --> 01:12:51,824
What if there were some mistake
and the progression went wrong,

827
01:12:52,034 --> 01:12:56,662
and something like an amoeba
were given power like a human's?

828
01:12:58,290 --> 01:13:00,750
That's what Akira is?

829
01:13:00,959 --> 01:13:04,045
Amoebas don't build houses and bridges.

830
01:13:04,254 --> 01:13:06,839
They just devour all the food around them.

831
01:13:07,049 --> 01:13:11,594
That's what Tetsuo's doing?
You're saying he has that kind of energy?!

832
01:13:11,804 --> 01:13:16,265
A long time ago, there were people
who tried to control that power.

833
01:13:16,475 --> 01:13:18,684
At the government's request, you see.

834
01:13:18,894 --> 01:13:24,190
They failed, and it triggered the Fall of Tokyo.

835
01:13:24,400 --> 01:13:28,736
That power is still too much for...

836
01:13:30,656 --> 01:13:32,198
What?!

837
01:13:32,408 --> 01:13:34,033
The door's unlocked.

838
01:13:37,538 --> 01:13:38,788
Huh?

839
01:13:43,752 --> 01:13:46,629
This has got to be a trap.

840
01:13:46,839 --> 01:13:47,713
Go back, then.

841
01:13:47,923 --> 01:13:52,009
No, we ought to find out
how much of it is a trap...

842
01:13:53,929 --> 01:13:58,891
By the way, what's
with you and that Ryu guy?

843
01:13:59,101 --> 01:14:01,018
...What do you mean?
... You're always together.

844
01:14:01,228 --> 01:14:03,855
That's none of your business!

845
01:14:04,064 --> 01:14:08,776
What I'm saying is, he doesn't
know about us, does he?

846
01:14:08,986 --> 01:14:09,694
"Us"?

847
01:14:09,903 --> 01:14:13,156
Hey, wait a minute!
What's that supposed to mean?

848
01:14:13,365 --> 01:14:14,615
Do you think this will work?

849
01:14:14,825 --> 01:14:21,164
It can't be helped. At this point,
our only option is to use her.

850
01:14:21,373 --> 01:14:28,087
The fact that she turned up right
under our noses says as much, I think.

851
01:14:28,297 --> 01:14:29,797
I guess...

852
01:14:43,353 --> 01:14:47,523
Have arrived at Ward 13,
East Ginza intersection. Over.

853
01:14:47,733 --> 01:14:50,943
Northern District battalion has not
responded to mobilization request.

854
01:14:51,153 --> 01:14:53,779
Special search team to HQ!
Special search team to HQ!

855
01:14:53,989 --> 01:14:57,909
We're at the Haruki-ya snack bar
near the highway interchange in Ward 8.

856
01:14:58,118 --> 01:15:03,956
It doesn't look like a bomb
explosion, so we think it was him.

857
01:15:04,166 --> 01:15:07,835
It was almost certainly the work of
the subject that escaped from the lab.

858
01:15:08,045 --> 01:15:10,963
Yes, sir! Yes, sir! Understood!

859
01:15:17,554 --> 01:15:18,971
Kaneda!

860
01:15:19,598 --> 01:15:22,058
What?! Yamagata's dead?!

861
01:15:22,267 --> 01:15:24,977
Something seemed strange
about him from the second I saw him.

862
01:15:25,187 --> 01:15:27,897
He was wearing what looked
like a white hospital gown.

863
01:15:28,106 --> 01:15:30,900
It was like he was a different person.

864
01:15:31,109 --> 01:15:35,988
Yamagata asked him
if he was really Tetsuo.

865
01:15:36,198 --> 01:15:40,576
And then... Yamagata, he...

866
01:15:43,580 --> 01:15:45,957
We've always been together.

867
01:15:46,166 --> 01:15:52,380
I've known everything about him
since we were in the children's home.

868
01:15:52,589 --> 01:15:57,343
He was a klutz, and
everybody made him cry.

869
01:15:57,553 --> 01:16:01,847
Oh, right... He wanted to
know where your bike was.

870
01:16:02,057 --> 01:16:03,808
My bike...?

871
01:16:12,150 --> 01:16:14,652
What're you gonna do?

872
01:16:14,861 --> 01:16:16,821
I'm gonna send Yamagata his bike.

873
01:16:21,743 --> 01:16:25,079
You dumb bastard!

874
01:16:27,499 --> 01:16:28,958
Kaneda!

875
01:16:45,225 --> 01:16:46,684
Kei!

876
01:16:46,893 --> 01:16:48,311
What's wrong?

877
01:16:52,107 --> 01:16:55,526
You! You were there that night...

878
01:16:58,572 --> 01:17:00,156
Wait!

879
01:17:06,038 --> 01:17:07,622
Kei!

880
01:17:11,043 --> 01:17:12,585
They disappeared!

881
01:17:14,254 --> 01:17:17,506
You were the ones who
changed Tetsuo too, weren't you?

882
01:17:17,716 --> 01:17:22,595
Akira's power exists within everyone.

883
01:17:22,804 --> 01:17:24,013
Who's there?!

884
01:17:25,057 --> 01:17:31,395
But when that power is awakened,
even if you weren't prepared for it,

885
01:17:31,605 --> 01:17:37,318
you must choose how to use it.

886
01:17:37,527 --> 01:17:40,613
And he has made his choice.

887
01:17:41,907 --> 01:17:47,078
Tetsuo is our newest companion.

888
01:17:47,287 --> 01:17:51,290
We're partly to blame for his actions.

889
01:17:51,500 --> 01:17:54,543
Why did you take Kei, then?!

890
01:17:54,753 --> 01:17:57,296
We want her to help us.

891
01:17:57,506 --> 01:18:00,633
You can't just use people
like that! Bring Kei back!

892
01:18:00,842 --> 01:18:05,388
Tetsuo's our friend! If anyone's
gonna kill him, it should be us!

893
01:18:07,641 --> 01:18:09,934
Hey!

894
01:18:10,143 --> 01:18:11,477
Damn it!

895
01:18:11,687 --> 01:18:15,773
Mr. Omi and the other executives
have been arrested by the coup...?

896
01:18:15,982 --> 01:18:17,024
Y- Yes, that's right.

897
01:18:17,234 --> 01:18:19,652
The house guards are
fighting them right now.

898
01:18:19,861 --> 01:18:21,028
Yes.

899
01:18:21,238 --> 01:18:23,739
I'd like to have a helicopter
waiting at West Haneda.

900
01:18:23,949 --> 01:18:25,366
Yes.

901
01:18:25,784 --> 01:18:29,453
That damned Colonel...
I can't believe he's taken up arms.

902
01:18:32,207 --> 01:18:34,041
I underestimated him.

903
01:18:38,422 --> 01:18:40,673
Hold them here! Damn!

904
01:19:10,996 --> 01:19:12,580
Mr. Nezu...

905
01:19:13,373 --> 01:19:16,125
R- Ryu?! Is that you?

906
01:19:16,334 --> 01:19:18,043
I'm sorry, sir...

907
01:19:18,253 --> 01:19:20,588
The mission was a failure.

908
01:19:20,797 --> 01:19:22,381
What are you doing here?!

909
01:19:22,591 --> 01:19:24,967
I've told you, you can't be seen here!

910
01:19:26,052 --> 01:19:27,970
All of my men...

911
01:19:28,180 --> 01:19:29,889
They've all been killed.

912
01:19:30,098 --> 01:19:33,517
Y- You sold me out,
didn't you, you bastard?!

913
01:19:33,727 --> 01:19:35,311
What? You can't be...

914
01:19:38,774 --> 01:19:40,566
Kei...

915
01:19:46,031 --> 01:19:48,741
I got fresh fish in here, buddy!
I'm gonna get compensated for 'em, right?

916
01:19:48,950 --> 01:19:52,286
Please, I have to catch a flight at noon!

917
01:19:53,121 --> 01:19:54,538
What?

918
01:19:54,748 --> 01:19:56,624
7th Avenue is just ahead!

919
01:19:56,833 --> 01:19:58,876
It intersects this road 100 meters from here!

920
01:20:03,340 --> 01:20:05,049
Prepare for battle!

921
01:20:13,600 --> 01:20:17,061
Right, we've spotted the subject.

922
01:20:17,270 --> 01:20:19,522
What? Attack?!

923
01:20:19,731 --> 01:20:23,692
But he's just a... We're attacking a boy?!

924
01:20:27,572 --> 01:20:28,572
Look! There he is!

925
01:20:28,782 --> 01:20:29,365
Impossible!

926
01:20:29,574 --> 01:20:31,116
Is this for real?

927
01:20:39,084 --> 01:20:42,461
"Samurai Spirit"

928
01:20:43,088 --> 01:20:44,964
Firing preparations complete.

929
01:20:47,384 --> 01:20:49,510
Damn it! Fire!

930
01:21:02,732 --> 01:21:04,525
...Akira!
... It's Lord Akira!

931
01:21:04,734 --> 01:21:07,486
It's the advent of Lord Akira!

932
01:21:07,696 --> 01:21:09,280
That's not him! Don't be fooled!

933
01:21:09,489 --> 01:21:10,364
That's not Lord Akira!

934
01:21:10,574 --> 01:21:12,032
Shut up!

935
01:21:12,826 --> 01:21:15,995
Long live Lord Akira!

936
01:21:16,204 --> 01:21:17,913
Fire!

937
01:21:18,582 --> 01:21:19,415
Huh?

938
01:21:19,624 --> 01:21:21,041
What's wrong?

939
01:22:48,254 --> 01:22:51,048
"Akira"

940
01:22:51,049 --> 01:22:54,134
in spite of martial law in the
name of freedom of the press!

941
01:22:54,344 --> 01:22:57,972
What in the world is
happening here in Neo Tokyo?

942
01:22:58,181 --> 01:23:00,933
What you see here seems to
be fires caused by tank cannons.

943
01:23:01,142 --> 01:23:03,978
But who is this young boy?

944
01:23:04,187 --> 01:23:07,272
Is he fighting the coup forces all by himself?

945
01:23:07,482 --> 01:23:13,779
Viewers, the army has just
illegally ordered us to land!

946
01:23:13,989 --> 01:23:16,115
Freedom of the press is now in jeopardy!

947
01:23:16,324 --> 01:23:18,575
What happened? Were they cut off?

948
01:23:18,785 --> 01:23:20,703
The bridge! He's heading for the bridge!

949
01:23:22,580 --> 01:23:23,872
Let's go see!

950
01:23:40,557 --> 01:23:42,725
Are you really going alone?

951
01:23:43,560 --> 01:23:46,186
He wants this, doesn't he?

952
01:23:46,396 --> 01:23:49,356
We should call the gang together.

953
01:23:49,566 --> 01:23:50,774
Hey!

954
01:23:50,984 --> 01:23:53,402
I wouldn't want to keep him waiting.

955
01:23:55,238 --> 01:23:57,948
Hey, Kaneda! Wait!

956
01:24:04,497 --> 01:24:06,707
Half seem to be
anti-government demonstrators.

957
01:24:06,916 --> 01:24:11,253
The rest are... Well, they're more
like some crazy cult than onlookers.

958
01:24:11,463 --> 01:24:14,590
They're following after the subject,
and more and more keep coming.

959
01:24:17,635 --> 01:24:22,139
"We Worship the Great Lord Akira"

960
01:24:22,140 --> 01:24:24,600
"We Worship the Great Lord Akira"

961
01:24:24,809 --> 01:24:30,189
Consume our unclean hearts!

962
01:24:30,398 --> 01:24:32,691
Fear not!

963
01:24:32,901 --> 01:24:38,197
Your bodies will be purified in the flames!

964
01:24:39,240 --> 01:24:40,616
Ready!

965
01:24:42,619 --> 01:24:44,203
Fire!

966
01:24:49,584 --> 01:24:53,212
Set the switch to hold for three
seconds and converge your beams!

967
01:24:53,421 --> 01:24:54,379
Aim!

968
01:24:54,589 --> 01:24:56,048
Fire!

969
01:25:01,596 --> 01:25:03,764
Watch this!

970
01:25:09,479 --> 01:25:11,605
Look out! Let's get out of here!

971
01:25:22,158 --> 01:25:24,118
Help me!

972
01:25:30,625 --> 01:25:33,210
Ground forces! Ground forces, come in!

973
01:25:33,419 --> 01:25:35,337
Report! What is the subject's status?!

974
01:25:35,547 --> 01:25:36,922
Ground forces!

975
01:25:38,967 --> 01:25:40,467
Call the Doctor.

976
01:25:40,677 --> 01:25:43,554
We have confirmation of his
recent movements and are in pursuit.

977
01:25:43,763 --> 01:25:46,098
His present position is... Let's see...

978
01:25:46,307 --> 01:25:51,395
Coordinates 99871 by 4332.

979
01:25:51,604 --> 01:25:55,190
That's about 2 km south of the
Olympics construction site in the old city.

980
01:25:55,400 --> 01:25:56,775
What?!

981
01:26:01,990 --> 01:26:03,866
What was that?

982
01:26:04,075 --> 01:26:05,868
Look!

983
01:26:06,077 --> 01:26:09,621
That's near the toll booth that's
being guarded by the 2nd platoon.

984
01:26:09,831 --> 01:26:12,207
Wha...?

985
01:26:12,417 --> 01:26:13,417
Huh?

986
01:26:16,171 --> 01:26:19,923
Please turn around!
This area's off limits to civilians!

987
01:26:20,133 --> 01:26:22,551
What? That's the subject?!

988
01:26:22,760 --> 01:26:24,136
S- Stop!

989
01:26:24,345 --> 01:26:26,096
Stop, damn it!

990
01:27:31,496 --> 01:27:34,039
Nice place you have here.

991
01:27:41,297 --> 01:27:44,007
Wait, you were with Kaneda.

992
01:27:44,217 --> 01:27:48,679
You shouldn't use your power this way.

993
01:27:48,888 --> 01:27:49,805
What?

994
01:27:50,014 --> 01:27:54,643
In the end, you won't be able to control it.

995
01:27:54,852 --> 01:27:56,144
The kids...

996
01:27:56,354 --> 01:27:58,146
You're those brats, aren't you?!

997
01:28:16,082 --> 01:28:18,041
Okay, then...!

998
01:28:40,023 --> 01:28:41,064
What the...?

999
01:28:52,660 --> 01:28:54,119
It's not safe here, Colonel!

1000
01:29:35,078 --> 01:29:37,829
Well, what're you gonna do?

1001
01:31:04,500 --> 01:31:06,126
Open up!

1002
01:31:16,804 --> 01:31:18,680
What the hell?

1003
01:31:18,890 --> 01:31:21,683
That's Akira, Tetsuo!

1004
01:31:21,893 --> 01:31:25,020
That's the "Akira" you wanted to meet.

1005
01:31:25,229 --> 01:31:27,856
There's your Messiah!

1006
01:31:28,065 --> 01:31:30,400
After his transcendental awakening,

1007
01:31:30,610 --> 01:31:35,238
his body was subjected to
every test known to science.

1008
01:31:35,448 --> 01:31:39,451
And that's what was left of it.

1009
01:31:46,918 --> 01:31:48,418
"Cranial Nerve"

1010
01:31:48,503 --> 01:31:52,589
The scientists back then
were unable to solve the mystery,

1011
01:31:52,798 --> 01:31:56,885
so they decided to entrust their
collected data and test samples

1012
01:31:57,094 --> 01:32:02,432
to future generations by
preserving them in a frozen capsule.

1013
01:32:02,642 --> 01:32:04,059
SOL... We'll use SOL!

1014
01:32:04,268 --> 01:32:05,727
Sir?

1015
01:32:07,396 --> 01:32:10,273
Akira is already dead!

1016
01:32:10,483 --> 01:32:13,735
Well? Are you satisfied now, Tetsuo?

1017
01:32:18,574 --> 01:32:20,867
So come back with us!

1018
01:32:21,077 --> 01:32:22,536
Like hell!

1019
01:32:23,454 --> 01:32:25,288
Contact the central defense center

1020
01:32:25,498 --> 01:32:29,042
and tell them to patch us
through to SOL's control circuits!

1021
01:32:29,252 --> 01:32:30,669
Yes, sir!

1022
01:32:46,227 --> 01:32:48,061
Hey, watch it!

1023
01:32:48,271 --> 01:32:52,399
Damn it, move! Get out of the way!

1024
01:33:08,791 --> 01:33:11,459
What is this, science class?

1025
01:33:28,394 --> 01:33:31,396
What's wrong? Have some trouble?

1026
01:33:31,606 --> 01:33:35,191
Yeah, but I already took care of it.

1027
01:33:35,401 --> 01:33:37,319
If you were here earlier,
you could've watched the show.

1028
01:33:37,528 --> 01:33:40,196
You had me worried again.

1029
01:33:40,406 --> 01:33:43,491
I figured you'd be standing here,
sobbing like a little baby.

1030
01:33:43,701 --> 01:33:48,204
Kaneda, you've always
been a pain in the ass.

1031
01:33:48,414 --> 01:33:53,001
You've been telling me what
to do ever since we were kids.

1032
01:33:53,210 --> 01:33:55,170
You always treat me like a kid.

1033
01:33:55,379 --> 01:33:58,048
You always show up and
start bossing me around!

1034
01:33:58,257 --> 01:34:00,175
And now you're a boss, too...

1035
01:34:00,384 --> 01:34:02,218
Of this pile of rubble.

1036
01:34:02,428 --> 01:34:03,553
Kaneda!

1037
01:34:03,763 --> 01:34:06,222
That's Mister Kaneda to you, punk!

1038
01:34:06,432 --> 01:34:08,975
Die!

1039
01:34:18,152 --> 01:34:19,569
Tetsuo!

1040
01:34:43,469 --> 01:34:45,345
Son of a...

1041
01:34:58,567 --> 01:34:59,859
Kei!

1042
01:35:01,570 --> 01:35:02,987
Oh, hell!

1043
01:35:06,617 --> 01:35:09,244
Let's do it!

1044
01:35:19,839 --> 01:35:21,464
Got him!

1045
01:35:22,675 --> 01:35:24,259
Huh?

1046
01:35:28,723 --> 01:35:30,098
The battery?!

1047
01:35:30,307 --> 01:35:32,183
What's the matter, Kaneda?

1048
01:35:33,644 --> 01:35:35,979
God damn it! This ain't fair, Tetsuo!

1049
01:35:36,188 --> 01:35:37,981
Fight with your bare hands!

1050
01:35:41,068 --> 01:35:42,736
Oh, this is funny...

1051
01:35:44,238 --> 01:35:46,614
Feeling frustrated, Kaneda?

1052
01:35:46,824 --> 01:35:50,160
Now do you understand how it feels?

1053
01:35:56,292 --> 01:35:58,251
What's this light?

1054
01:36:09,096 --> 01:36:10,096
Well, did you hit him?

1055
01:36:10,306 --> 01:36:13,099
We're too close to the impact point.
There's too much electrical interference.

1056
01:36:13,309 --> 01:36:14,934
Prepare a second volley!

1057
01:36:37,792 --> 01:36:42,462
Hey! Kaneda!

1058
01:37:00,564 --> 01:37:03,817
Tetsuo!

1059
01:37:18,833 --> 01:37:20,416
Shit...

1060
01:37:20,626 --> 01:37:21,918
Huh?

1061
01:37:22,127 --> 01:37:23,294
What the...?

1062
01:37:59,039 --> 01:38:00,665
Correcting for tracking system error.

1063
01:38:00,875 --> 01:38:02,709
T- minus-20 to energy alteration.

1064
01:38:02,918 --> 01:38:04,210
...Fire extinguishers!
... Are you okay?

1065
01:38:04,420 --> 01:38:05,003
Hurry! Hurry!

1066
01:38:05,212 --> 01:38:07,881
What happened? What's going on?

1067
01:38:16,599 --> 01:38:18,600
Kaneda!

1068
01:38:20,019 --> 01:38:21,185
Kai! Kei!

1069
01:38:21,395 --> 01:38:22,729
...Kaneda!
... Kaneda!

1070
01:38:22,938 --> 01:38:23,646
Get on!

1071
01:38:23,856 --> 01:38:24,898
Get on? Where?

1072
01:38:25,107 --> 01:38:26,649
Hurry! Hurry!

1073
01:38:48,923 --> 01:38:50,423
What's that?

1074
01:39:04,438 --> 01:39:06,731
They say it's SOL.

1075
01:39:17,409 --> 01:39:19,285
Magnificent...

1076
01:39:28,796 --> 01:39:32,799
When Tetsuo's power reaches its peak?

1077
01:39:33,008 --> 01:39:34,676
That's when we do it.

1078
01:39:34,885 --> 01:39:37,637
But will it work?

1079
01:39:38,389 --> 01:39:43,267
The future doesn't
proceed along a single course.

1080
01:39:43,477 --> 01:39:47,230
There ought to be a future we can choose.

1081
01:39:56,991 --> 01:39:58,533
What's Tetsuo's status?

1082
01:39:58,742 --> 01:40:00,535
Ah, Colonel...

1083
01:40:00,744 --> 01:40:04,038
We set up a camera in the stadium a while ago.

1084
01:40:04,248 --> 01:40:05,873
We have him under observation.

1085
01:40:07,418 --> 01:40:11,421
Colonel, you must take a look at this data!

1086
01:40:11,630 --> 01:40:14,590
We're still analyzing the energy
given off by the subject, but...

1087
01:40:14,800 --> 01:40:17,635
It's magnificent. Absolutely magnificent.

1088
01:40:17,845 --> 01:40:20,513
This is clearly a proton collapse.

1089
01:40:20,723 --> 01:40:24,684
We're also detecting a fair number of
what we believe to be unknown particles.

1090
01:40:24,893 --> 01:40:27,729
If we can put this into a
theoretical framework, physics...

1091
01:40:27,938 --> 01:40:29,188
No, science...

1092
01:40:29,398 --> 01:40:32,525
Humanity itself could touch the
fundamental truths of the universe!

1093
01:40:34,820 --> 01:40:36,487
Oh. That's...

1094
01:40:36,697 --> 01:40:39,198
We still haven't finished
making our adjustments.

1095
01:40:39,408 --> 01:40:41,576
Uh, Colonel!

1096
01:40:46,415 --> 01:40:48,374
T- That's...!

1097
01:40:51,378 --> 01:40:53,671
You bastard! What did I tell you?!

1098
01:40:53,881 --> 01:40:55,506
B- But, Colonel!

1099
01:40:55,716 --> 01:40:59,177
I couldn't throw away
such a magnificent subject!

1100
01:40:59,762 --> 01:41:02,055
Shut up!

1101
01:41:24,495 --> 01:41:26,079
Shit! It's on fire!

1102
01:41:26,288 --> 01:41:27,371
The battery! The battery!

1103
01:41:27,581 --> 01:41:30,500
My bike! It's burning up!

1104
01:41:30,709 --> 01:41:33,044
Hey, what's a bike or two?

1105
01:41:33,253 --> 01:41:37,215
What? Then there's nothing
wrong with using yours, right?

1106
01:41:37,424 --> 01:41:38,424
You heard that?

1107
01:41:38,634 --> 01:41:39,675
Yeah, I did!

1108
01:41:39,885 --> 01:41:41,803
Hey, your bike's still on fire.

1109
01:42:23,345 --> 01:42:25,263
Tetsuo?

1110
01:42:36,567 --> 01:42:40,820
Tetsuo, why does
everyone call you "Akira"?

1111
01:42:41,029 --> 01:42:45,366
He never existed in the first place.

1112
01:42:45,576 --> 01:42:48,286
They didn't care who it was.

1113
01:42:50,247 --> 01:42:53,040
Just so long as he destroyed things.

1114
01:42:53,250 --> 01:42:55,543
Your arm!

1115
01:42:55,752 --> 01:42:59,422
It doesn't look like much,
but it works pretty good.

1116
01:43:02,551 --> 01:43:04,719
What's wrong? Are you okay?

1117
01:43:07,389 --> 01:43:08,931
It's nothing!

1118
01:43:09,141 --> 01:43:09,849
Tetsuo...

1119
01:43:10,058 --> 01:43:11,851
Shut up! Just go away!

1120
01:43:19,568 --> 01:43:21,736
Medicine...

1121
01:43:21,945 --> 01:43:25,114
What's wrong, Tetsuo? Are you in pain?

1122
01:43:25,324 --> 01:43:28,868
Go back to the lab and
get me some of that medicine!

1123
01:43:29,077 --> 01:43:30,703
Did you hear that, Doctor?

1124
01:43:30,913 --> 01:43:32,121
Yes, Colonel.

1125
01:43:32,331 --> 01:43:34,498
Well? Can you see any signs of it?

1126
01:43:34,708 --> 01:43:37,084
I'm not entirely certain,

1127
01:43:37,294 --> 01:43:41,464
but it seems that the power that had
been held back by the drugs is breaking free.

1128
01:43:41,673 --> 01:43:45,092
He may not be able to control the
power that has awakened so suddenly.

1129
01:43:45,302 --> 01:43:47,803
At any rate, he's in an
extremely dangerous condition!

1130
01:43:48,764 --> 01:43:53,392
If you don't go back to the lab and
receive proper treatment, you may die.

1131
01:43:56,230 --> 01:43:59,941
You want me to enroll in that
kindergarten and live happily ever after?

1132
01:44:00,150 --> 01:44:06,030
Take my medicine every day
and shrivel up like those kids?!

1133
01:44:10,994 --> 01:44:14,664
Kaori... Kaori...

1134
01:44:15,082 --> 01:44:18,960
Please... I need that medicine...

1135
01:44:19,169 --> 01:44:20,836
No...!

1136
01:44:21,046 --> 01:44:22,129
Tetsuo!

1137
01:44:23,715 --> 01:44:25,383
Tetsuo!

1138
01:44:27,094 --> 01:44:28,344
Tetsuo...

1139
01:45:00,419 --> 01:45:02,169
Kaneda?!

1140
01:45:39,916 --> 01:45:41,250
Huh?

1141
01:45:48,550 --> 01:45:50,718
Son of a...

1142
01:45:54,181 --> 01:45:56,515
You kids... What are you doing here?

1143
01:46:02,439 --> 01:46:04,607
You never learn, do you?

1144
01:46:06,610 --> 01:46:08,694
Tetsuo!

1145
01:46:22,626 --> 01:46:24,460
Takashi...

1146
01:46:26,755 --> 01:46:28,089
Akira...

1147
01:46:28,632 --> 01:46:30,758
"Optic Nerve"

1148
01:46:41,603 --> 01:46:45,856
Kaneda...? H-Help me...!

1149
01:46:54,783 --> 01:46:56,325
Kaori...

1150
01:46:59,788 --> 01:47:02,498
Help me...!

1151
01:47:13,802 --> 01:47:15,636
Help me!

1152
01:47:15,846 --> 01:47:17,930
Stop it!

1153
01:47:34,865 --> 01:47:35,656
Kaori?

1154
01:47:35,866 --> 01:47:38,701
Kaori! Kaori!

1155
01:47:38,910 --> 01:47:41,495
Tetsuo? Is that you, Tetsuo?!

1156
01:47:41,705 --> 01:47:44,665
Kaori! Kaori's gonna die!

1157
01:47:44,875 --> 01:47:47,460
What?! What did you say?!

1158
01:47:47,669 --> 01:47:50,129
My body's not doing what I tell it to!

1159
01:47:50,338 --> 01:47:52,756
My power's acting on its own...!

1160
01:47:52,966 --> 01:47:55,217
Kaori!

1161
01:47:55,427 --> 01:47:57,428
Kaori's dying!

1162
01:47:57,637 --> 01:47:59,763
Kaneda, help me!

1163
01:47:59,973 --> 01:48:01,849
Stop, Tetsuo!

1164
01:48:02,058 --> 01:48:04,018
Stop it!

1165
01:48:04,227 --> 01:48:08,022
Kaori's pain is coming into me...!

1166
01:48:09,649 --> 01:48:12,026
Tetsuo!

1167
01:48:12,235 --> 01:48:16,572
Kaneda! Run away!

1168
01:48:29,085 --> 01:48:31,587
Tetsuo!

1169
01:48:43,058 --> 01:48:46,852
Kiyoko! Takashi! Masaru! Get away from here!

1170
01:48:51,233 --> 01:48:52,358
Come on!

1171
01:48:58,907 --> 01:49:01,825
I can't believe it. It's as if...

1172
01:49:14,214 --> 01:49:17,508
Kiyoko! Taka...

1173
01:49:51,668 --> 01:49:55,546
Hi, Akira.

1174
01:50:04,306 --> 01:50:07,224
Th-This is...

1175
01:50:07,434 --> 01:50:09,935
But that's... Oh, no!

1176
01:50:19,070 --> 01:50:21,530
W- Where am I?

1177
01:50:21,740 --> 01:50:23,866
Hurry! Get into the tunnel!

1178
01:50:24,075 --> 01:50:25,284
You'll be safe in there.

1179
01:50:25,493 --> 01:50:27,494
Kiyoko! Where are you?

1180
01:50:42,093 --> 01:50:43,886
Tetsuo!

1181
01:50:44,095 --> 01:50:46,513
Kaneda!

1182
01:50:46,723 --> 01:50:48,098
Hang on!

1183
01:50:50,143 --> 01:50:52,561
...If you don't get out of here now, you'll...
... Out of the way!

1184
01:50:52,771 --> 01:50:54,104
Tetsuo!

1185
01:50:54,314 --> 01:50:56,357
Don't go!

1186
01:51:02,822 --> 01:51:05,199
No, Takashi!

1187
01:51:05,408 --> 01:51:08,744
If you went in now, you'd be trapped, too.

1188
01:51:08,953 --> 01:51:13,374
But none of this is his fault!

1189
01:51:19,798 --> 01:51:22,841
...Takashi!
... Takashi!

1190
01:51:29,140 --> 01:51:36,105
If we went in, we wouldn't be
strong enough to come back out.

1191
01:51:36,314 --> 01:51:40,401
But if the three of us worked together,
maybe we could at least save that boy.

1192
01:51:40,610 --> 01:51:42,111
You're right.

1193
01:51:42,320 --> 01:51:44,238
Together, the three of us could...

1194
01:51:53,039 --> 01:51:54,957
Oh, man...!

1195
01:51:55,166 --> 01:51:58,502
We should get out of here. Hey!

1196
01:51:58,712 --> 01:52:00,379
Kaneda...

1197
01:52:33,079 --> 01:52:36,457
Look, you're not revving your engine enough.

1198
01:52:36,666 --> 01:52:40,210
When you go into a corner, lean like
you're trying to kill yourself. Watch!

1199
01:52:40,420 --> 01:52:41,879
What're you doing?

1200
01:52:42,088 --> 01:52:44,131
Cornering, man.

1201
01:52:45,592 --> 01:52:47,593
Got it, Tetsuo...?

1202
01:52:53,641 --> 01:52:55,350
Look, there's another one!

1203
01:52:55,560 --> 01:52:57,686
...Another transfer student?
... He was abandoned.

1204
01:52:57,896 --> 01:52:59,938
You can see it in his face.

1205
01:53:03,651 --> 01:53:08,947
Are... Are these your dreams, Tetsuo?

1206
01:53:10,200 --> 01:53:11,408
Wait!

1207
01:54:28,736 --> 01:54:31,738
This is Akira...?

1208
01:54:31,948 --> 01:54:35,117
Yes. We called him.

1209
01:54:35,326 --> 01:54:37,411
To have him take Tetsuo away.

1210
01:54:37,620 --> 01:54:40,831
Take him away? Take him where?

1211
01:54:41,040 --> 01:54:43,208
It's too much for Tetsuo.

1212
01:54:43,418 --> 01:54:46,837
And for us. And for Akira.

1213
01:54:47,046 --> 01:54:50,591
It's too big for us as we are now.

1214
01:54:50,800 --> 01:54:54,595
But someday, we'll also be able to...

1215
01:54:54,804 --> 01:54:57,848
You see, it's already begun.

1216
01:54:58,057 --> 01:55:00,267
Your friend's...

1217
01:55:00,476 --> 01:55:02,978
My friend?

1218
01:55:03,187 --> 01:55:06,273
Kei! You mean Kei, don't you?

1219
01:55:31,758 --> 01:55:33,300
Tetsuo...

1220
01:55:38,056 --> 01:55:39,932
This is yours, right?

1221
01:55:45,730 --> 01:55:49,900
They're always like that with the
new kids. You came today, right?

1222
01:55:50,109 --> 01:55:51,610
They beat me up, too.

1223
01:55:51,819 --> 01:55:54,905
But the truth is, those guys are wimps.

1224
01:55:55,114 --> 01:56:00,869
I'm Tetsuo. Tetsuo Shima.

1225
01:56:01,079 --> 01:56:04,039
To tell you the truth, I just got here myself.

1226
01:56:04,248 --> 01:56:06,041
I'm...

1227
01:56:06,250 --> 01:56:07,751
Kaneda...

1228
01:56:09,003 --> 01:56:11,046
Kaneda?

1229
01:56:11,255 --> 01:56:11,838
Kaneda!

1230
01:56:12,048 --> 01:56:13,340
Kei?

1231
01:56:39,075 --> 01:56:42,703
W- What's happening?
What in the world is happening?

1232
01:56:45,039 --> 01:56:47,332
B- But this isn't...

1233
01:56:47,542 --> 01:56:52,379
If this is correct, it's almost as if...
Is this the birth of a universe?!

1234
01:56:58,136 --> 01:57:01,304
Kei!

1235
01:57:06,894 --> 01:57:08,478
What happened?

1236
01:57:10,690 --> 01:57:13,275
It's disappearing...! It's disappearing!

1237
01:58:24,347 --> 01:58:27,349
Kaneda!

1238
01:58:50,081 --> 01:58:51,665
Tetsuo...

1239
01:58:54,335 --> 01:58:56,169
Kaneda...

1240
01:58:57,380 --> 01:58:58,547
Thanks.

1241
01:59:00,216 --> 01:59:03,552
You called to me, right? I heard you.

1242
01:59:10,351 --> 01:59:13,270
Kaneda, don't tell me you're...

1243
01:59:13,479 --> 01:59:15,689
What about Tetsuo?

1244
01:59:15,898 --> 01:59:18,483
He left.

1245
01:59:18,693 --> 01:59:20,652
So did those three kids.

1246
01:59:20,862 --> 01:59:21,945
Akira, too.

1247
01:59:22,155 --> 01:59:24,573
Kaneda, back then, you...

1248
01:59:26,409 --> 01:59:31,371
Kaneda! You're alive?!

1249
01:59:31,581 --> 01:59:38,295
I thought you were in there for sure!

1250
01:59:38,504 --> 01:59:39,379
Tetsuo...

1251
01:59:39,589 --> 01:59:41,548
What happened to Tetsuo?

1252
01:59:41,757 --> 01:59:43,008
Is he dead?!

1253
01:59:43,217 --> 01:59:46,553
I'm not so sure. But he's probably...

1254
02:00:12,371 --> 02:00:16,041
But someday, we'll also be able to...

1255
02:00:16,250 --> 02:00:18,752
You see, it's already begun.

1256
02:00:37,563 --> 02:00:42,192
I am... Tetsuo.
