1
00:00:10,831 --> 00:00:14,358
In the beginning,
God created beast and man

2
00:00:14,435 --> 00:00:17,029
so that both might live
in friendship

3
00:00:17,104 --> 00:00:21,268
and share dominion
over a world at peace.

4
00:00:21,342 --> 00:00:27,372
But in the fullness of time,
evil men betrayed God's trust,

5
00:00:27,448 --> 00:00:29,541
and in disobedience
to His holy word

6
00:00:29,617 --> 00:00:32,051
waged bloody wars,

7
00:00:32,119 --> 00:00:34,883
not only
against theirown kind,

8
00:00:34,956 --> 00:00:41,054
but against the apes,
whom they reduced to slavery..

9
00:00:41,128 --> 00:00:45,861
Then God, in His wrath,
sent the world a savior,

10
00:00:45,933 --> 00:00:48,697
miraculously born of two apes,

11
00:00:48,769 --> 00:00:53,604
who descended on Earth
from Earth's own future.

12
00:00:53,674 --> 00:00:55,801
And man was afraid,

13
00:00:55,876 --> 00:01:00,108
for both parent apes possessed
the power of speech.

14
00:01:00,181 --> 00:01:01,705
Come on!

15
00:01:16,664 --> 00:01:18,131
Cornelius!

16
00:01:30,711 --> 00:01:36,047
[Gunfire]

17
00:01:55,569 --> 00:01:58,367
so both were brutally murdered.

18
00:01:58,439 --> 00:02:01,931
But the child ape survived

19
00:02:02,009 --> 00:02:05,706
and grew up to
set his fellow creatures free

20
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:09,011
from the yoke
of human slavery..

21
00:02:09,083 --> 00:02:10,675
Do.

22
00:02:17,258 --> 00:02:18,589
No!

23
00:04:00,494 --> 00:04:03,463
Yet in the aftermath
of this victory.,

24
00:04:03,531 --> 00:04:06,091
the surface of the world
was ravaged

25
00:04:06,167 --> 00:04:10,695
by the vilest war
in human history..

26
00:04:10,771 --> 00:04:12,796
The great cities of the world
split as under

27
00:04:12,873 --> 00:04:14,807
and were flattened.

28
00:04:14,875 --> 00:04:17,309
And out of one such city,

29
00:04:17,378 --> 00:04:21,314
our savior led a remnant
of those who survived

30
00:04:21,382 --> 00:04:24,112
in search of green erpastures,

31
00:04:24,185 --> 00:04:28,315
where ape and human might
forever live in friendship

32
00:04:28,389 --> 00:04:32,325
according to divine will.

33
00:04:32,393 --> 00:04:35,487
His name was Caesar,

34
00:04:35,563 --> 00:04:40,796
and this is hisstory.
in those far-off days.

35
00:08:16,263 --> 00:08:18,493
You'll never
make it,Jake.

36
00:08:18,566 --> 00:08:20,557
Nah, we'll make it.

37
00:08:21,969 --> 00:08:23,903
I'll show you how.

38
00:08:44,191 --> 00:08:45,681
Thanks, Aldo.

39
00:08:45,759 --> 00:08:48,694
You will call me by
my proper rank--General!

40
00:08:49,930 --> 00:08:51,522
Yes, General.

41
00:08:54,635 --> 00:08:56,227
Don't put him
in the corral.

42
00:08:56,303 --> 00:08:57,634
I won't be long.

43
00:08:57,738 --> 00:09:00,468
Ape shall never kill ape.

44
00:09:00,541 --> 00:09:03,635
Ape shall never kill ape.

45
00:09:03,711 --> 00:09:05,975
Ape shall never kill ape.

46
00:09:06,046 --> 00:09:07,980
Ape shall never kill ape.

47
00:09:08,048 --> 00:09:11,313
Shall ape
ever kill man?

48
00:09:12,553 --> 00:09:14,282
You're late, General Aldo.

49
00:09:14,355 --> 00:09:16,619
Come and read this
to the class.

50
00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:18,715
I won't.

51
00:09:18,792 --> 00:09:21,454
You won't
because you can't,

52
00:09:21,529 --> 00:09:25,488
and you can't because
you don't want to learn,

53
00:09:25,566 --> 00:09:27,830
and it is my duty to
report this to Caesar.

54
00:09:27,902 --> 00:09:29,233
[Growls]

55
00:09:29,303 --> 00:09:32,101
If my father
were a gorilla,

56
00:09:32,173 --> 00:09:35,540
we'd be learning
riding instead ofwriting.

57
00:09:35,609 --> 00:09:37,236
[Laughter]

58
00:09:38,579 --> 00:09:40,012
Silence.

59
00:09:41,415 --> 00:09:42,507
Silence.

60
00:09:44,084 --> 00:09:49,545
Cornelius, you are
Caesar's son and heir.

61
00:09:49,623 --> 00:09:53,081
Being a good rider isn't enough
for being a good ruler,

62
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:55,185
though in human history,

63
00:09:55,262 --> 00:09:57,696
quite a number
of military dictators

64
00:09:57,765 --> 00:09:59,357
seem to have thought so.

65
00:09:59,433 --> 00:10:00,866
Now, all of you take up

66
00:10:00,935 --> 00:10:02,232
your charcoal sticks
and your parchments

67
00:10:02,303 --> 00:10:04,794
and copy down
what I've written.

68
00:10:04,872 --> 00:10:07,841
The best shall be hung
from these hooks.

69
00:10:07,908 --> 00:10:11,105
I can think of better things
to hang from those hooks.

70
00:10:12,446 --> 00:10:14,846
But, Virgil, can we
tamper with time?

71
00:10:14,915 --> 00:10:16,610
- Accept my premise.
-What premise?

72
00:10:16,684 --> 00:10:20,017
That since man once learned
to travel faster than sound,

73
00:10:20,087 --> 00:10:22,317
he could later have learned
to travel faster than light.

74
00:10:22,389 --> 00:10:24,016
We accept.

75
00:10:24,091 --> 00:10:26,218
Imagine a musician
giving a live broadcast

76
00:10:26,293 --> 00:10:28,557
from what was once London
to what was once New York

77
00:10:28,629 --> 00:10:29,755
on a Wednesday.

78
00:10:29,830 --> 00:10:31,764
He then travels
faster than light

79
00:10:31,832 --> 00:10:33,527
from London to New York,

80
00:10:33,601 --> 00:10:36,331
where he arrives--as
physicists would confirm--

81
00:10:36,403 --> 00:10:37,631
on the previous Tuesday,

82
00:10:37,705 --> 00:10:40,173
Iistens to his own
broadcast on the Wednesday,

83
00:10:40,241 --> 00:10:42,539
dislikes
its quality intensely,

84
00:10:42,610 --> 00:10:45,408
then travels back
faster than light to London

85
00:10:45,479 --> 00:10:48,915
in time for him to decide
not to give his broadcast.

86
00:10:48,983 --> 00:10:51,975
Come. I'll prove it
to you logically.

87
00:10:57,625 --> 00:10:59,684
Good, Cornelius,

88
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,284
butyou've made
a mistake here.

89
00:11:01,362 --> 00:11:02,727
You have put a " B"

90
00:11:02,796 --> 00:11:04,991
in place of
the second " P".

91
00:11:05,065 --> 00:11:07,932
Teacher, have you
forgotten your own name?

92
00:11:09,970 --> 00:11:13,167
Everyone has always called me
teacher that I had forgotten.

93
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:15,674
"Ape shall never
kill Abe."

94
00:11:15,743 --> 00:11:17,176
Thank you, Cornelius.

95
00:11:17,244 --> 00:11:19,303
That was a very kind thought.

96
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:21,848
Gorillas.
All right, Aldo,

97
00:11:21,915 --> 00:11:24,213
Iet's start with you.

98
00:11:27,521 --> 00:11:29,955
General Aldo.

99
00:11:36,363 --> 00:11:38,490
With respect,
General Aldo,

100
00:11:38,565 --> 00:11:39,998
this is barely legible

101
00:11:40,067 --> 00:11:41,591
and will have to
be written again.

102
00:11:41,669 --> 00:11:46,003
Your capital "A" Ieans over
like a tent in a high wind.

103
00:11:46,073 --> 00:11:48,473
Ha ha ha!

104
00:11:50,544 --> 00:11:52,478
And your capital " K"...

105
00:11:54,715 --> 00:11:58,947
"Ape shall never
kill Abe."

106
00:11:59,019 --> 00:12:01,044
No, Aldo! No!

107
00:12:06,093 --> 00:12:08,186
Teacher!

108
00:12:08,262 --> 00:12:10,662
Teacher, you've spoken
the unspeakable.

109
00:12:10,731 --> 00:12:12,892
I n all ouryears
of slavery to mankind,

110
00:12:12,966 --> 00:12:14,194
the word " no"
was the one word

111
00:12:14,268 --> 00:12:15,895
we were electrically
conditioned to fear.

112
00:12:15,969 --> 00:12:18,699
Caesar has forbidden you
its utterance in perpetuity.

113
00:12:18,772 --> 00:12:20,763
An ape may say no
to a human,

114
00:12:20,841 --> 00:12:24,709
but a human may never
again say no to an ape.

115
00:12:24,778 --> 00:12:26,177
Tell him you're sorry,
Abe, and go home

116
00:12:26,246 --> 00:12:27,713
while you've still
got a home to go to.

117
00:12:27,781 --> 00:12:29,908
I'll put in a good word
foryou with Caesar.

118
00:12:36,123 --> 00:12:39,752
General Aldo,
I'm sorry.

119
00:12:39,827 --> 00:12:41,818
The writing you destroyed
was by Caesar's son.

120
00:12:41,895 --> 00:12:43,863
I did not want you to
suffer Caesar's anger!

121
00:12:43,931 --> 00:12:45,694
What do I care
for Caesar's anger?

122
00:12:45,766 --> 00:12:48,166
Let me give you
a taste of mine!

123
00:13:10,557 --> 00:13:12,354
Grab him!

124
00:13:12,426 --> 00:13:14,451
Stop, teacher!
Grab him!

125
00:13:14,528 --> 00:13:15,961
Stop!

126
00:13:23,537 --> 00:13:25,971
Grab him.
Grab the teacher!

127
00:13:38,018 --> 00:13:39,315
Stop!

128
00:13:39,386 --> 00:13:40,444
Stop!

129
00:13:40,521 --> 00:13:43,490
We'll teach the
teacher a lesson.

130
00:13:43,557 --> 00:13:46,526
Throw him in the corral,
where all humans belong.

131
00:13:51,198 --> 00:13:53,325
I said stop, Aldo.

132
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:54,765
He broke the law.

133
00:13:54,835 --> 00:13:57,429
With his own mouth,
he broke the first law.

134
00:13:57,504 --> 00:14:00,371
I am the law.
What has he done?

135
00:14:00,441 --> 00:14:04,138
Caesar, I was there.

136
00:14:04,211 --> 00:14:07,203
Teacher only reverted
to type under provocation.

137
00:14:07,281 --> 00:14:10,444
He spoke like a slave master
in the old days of our servitude.

138
00:14:10,517 --> 00:14:14,385
When we were conditioned
to mechanical obedience.

139
00:14:14,455 --> 00:14:16,980
He uttered
a negative imperative.

140
00:14:17,057 --> 00:14:19,082
Could you put that
into words

141
00:14:19,159 --> 00:14:21,184
which even Caesar
could understand?

142
00:14:21,261 --> 00:14:25,664
Um, he said,
" No, Aldo. No."

143
00:14:25,732 --> 00:14:27,324
[Grunts]

144
00:14:27,401 --> 00:14:28,868
The schoolroom
was wrecked.

145
00:14:28,936 --> 00:14:30,369
The class is ended.

146
00:14:30,437 --> 00:14:31,995
The schoolroom
is closed!

147
00:14:32,072 --> 00:14:33,699
Now we'll go back
to riding horses!

148
00:14:35,175 --> 00:14:36,199
Aldo!

149
00:14:37,878 --> 00:14:39,812
You and your friends

150
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:42,246
will return
to the schoolroom

151
00:14:42,316 --> 00:14:45,285
and put it back
in order.

152
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:48,954
Abe, no gorilla
is to be dismissed

153
00:14:49,022 --> 00:14:51,957
until everything
is back in its place.

154
00:14:52,025 --> 00:14:53,458
Yes, Caesar.

155
00:14:53,527 --> 00:14:56,291
Father, since there won't be
any more school today,

156
00:14:56,363 --> 00:14:58,456
may I go out
and play?

157
00:14:58,532 --> 00:15:01,467
Can't you study
in the house?

158
00:15:01,535 --> 00:15:03,330
I could,
Father, but...

159
00:15:03,464 --> 00:15:05,955
Run along and play.

160
00:15:07,401 --> 00:15:09,335
Where are
my students?

161
00:15:09,403 --> 00:15:11,337
I wasjust
in the midst

162
00:15:11,405 --> 00:15:13,839
of explaining my theory
of time relativity.

163
00:15:13,908 --> 00:15:16,206
If Caesar permits,
I would like my--

164
00:15:16,277 --> 00:15:18,006
Caesar permits.

165
00:15:19,346 --> 00:15:21,280
You look concerned,
MacDonald.

166
00:15:21,348 --> 00:15:22,713
I am, Caesar.

167
00:15:22,783 --> 00:15:24,717
I think
that Aldo's hatred

168
00:15:24,785 --> 00:15:26,719
is not confined
to humans.

169
00:15:30,257 --> 00:15:31,224
Look out!

170
00:15:40,101 --> 00:15:44,868
I think Aldo may be
riding for a fall.

171
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:48,405
If only my mother
and father,

172
00:15:48,476 --> 00:15:51,877
whom I was too
young to remember,

173
00:15:51,946 --> 00:15:53,379
if only
they'd lived,

174
00:15:53,447 --> 00:15:55,381
perhaps they would
have taught me

175
00:15:55,449 --> 00:15:58,247
if it was right
to kill evil

176
00:15:58,319 --> 00:16:00,879
so that good
should prevail.

177
00:16:00,955 --> 00:16:03,890
But you know,
Caesar, history shows--

178
00:16:03,958 --> 00:16:07,325
oh, no, no, no.
That is human history,

179
00:16:07,394 --> 00:16:08,918
not ape history.

180
00:16:08,996 --> 00:16:11,396
Ape never kills ape.

181
00:16:13,467 --> 00:16:15,560
oh, here's the list

182
00:16:15,636 --> 00:16:18,571
of our winter
supplies so far.

183
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:19,731
I've got to be
getting along.

184
00:16:19,807 --> 00:16:21,741
I'm starving.
I could eat a horse.

185
00:16:21,809 --> 00:16:23,640
A horse?

186
00:16:23,711 --> 00:16:25,611
oh, you remember Lisa.

187
00:16:25,679 --> 00:16:26,941
They used to eat
lots of things--

188
00:16:27,014 --> 00:16:29,847
dead cattle, dead chickens,
dead pigs.

189
00:16:29,917 --> 00:16:32,579
Now we live
and chew nuts

190
00:16:32,653 --> 00:16:35,121
at our master's
command.

191
00:16:35,189 --> 00:16:37,817
That will be all,
J ulie.

192
00:16:37,892 --> 00:16:39,325
Thank you.

193
00:16:40,427 --> 00:16:42,827
We are not
your masters.

194
00:16:44,899 --> 00:16:46,696
We're not
your equals.

195
00:16:48,402 --> 00:16:51,838
MacDonald, I believe that

196
00:16:51,906 --> 00:16:55,535
when you truly grow to know
and trust a person,

197
00:16:55,609 --> 00:16:57,338
you cannot help
but like him.

198
00:16:57,411 --> 00:17:00,574
When we grow to know
and trust your people,

199
00:17:00,648 --> 00:17:02,843
then we shall
all be equals

200
00:17:02,917 --> 00:17:05,977
and remain so until
the end of the world.

201
00:17:06,053 --> 00:17:08,044
Which may be sooner
than you think.

202
00:17:08,122 --> 00:17:09,521
You are such a pessimist!

203
00:17:09,590 --> 00:17:11,057
or a prophet.

204
00:17:11,125 --> 00:17:13,491
Now that apes
are at the helm,

205
00:17:13,561 --> 00:17:15,995
the Earth will sail
safely through space

206
00:17:16,063 --> 00:17:17,087
until the end of time,

207
00:17:17,164 --> 00:17:20,099
and Virgil says
time has no end,

208
00:17:20,167 --> 00:17:22,294
so you see
I cannot believe you.

209
00:17:22,369 --> 00:17:25,338
Would you believe it
if you heard it

210
00:17:25,406 --> 00:17:28,603
from the lips
of your own parents?

211
00:17:29,777 --> 00:17:32,007
Are my parents alive?

212
00:17:32,079 --> 00:17:36,038
No, but their images
and their voices are.

213
00:17:36,116 --> 00:17:39,142
MacDonald, when you talk
about my parents,

214
00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:41,518
please do not speak
in riddles.

215
00:17:41,589 --> 00:17:42,954
I cannot see them.
I cannot hear them.

216
00:17:43,023 --> 00:17:44,991
They came out
of the future.

217
00:17:45,059 --> 00:17:47,289
They cannot
give me knowledge.

218
00:17:47,361 --> 00:17:51,161
Caesar,
you can see them.

219
00:17:51,232 --> 00:17:53,166
You can hear them,

220
00:17:53,234 --> 00:17:55,668
and they can
give you knowledge.

221
00:17:55,736 --> 00:17:57,101
How?

222
00:17:57,171 --> 00:18:00,163
Under the dead city
where we once lived

223
00:18:00,241 --> 00:18:03,176
in the archives near
the old command post,

224
00:18:03,244 --> 00:18:05,678
there are tapes--
sealed tapes--

225
00:18:05,746 --> 00:18:07,611
of Cornelius and Zira

226
00:18:07,681 --> 00:18:10,878
being examined by officials
of the American government.

227
00:18:10,951 --> 00:18:12,782
When my brother was
Governor Breck's assistant,

228
00:18:12,853 --> 00:18:14,184
he told me about them.

229
00:18:14,255 --> 00:18:17,156
I know where they are,

230
00:18:17,224 --> 00:18:19,158
and I know that they
concern Earth's future,

231
00:18:19,226 --> 00:18:20,591
from which
your parents came.

232
00:18:20,661 --> 00:18:22,856
But the city
was flattened.

233
00:18:22,930 --> 00:18:24,864
The bomb left nothing.

234
00:18:24,932 --> 00:18:27,196
Except, I suspect...

235
00:18:27,268 --> 00:18:29,361
the archive section.

236
00:18:29,436 --> 00:18:31,870
I ndeed, many sections
of the underground city

237
00:18:31,939 --> 00:18:34,430
were designed
to survive the impact

238
00:18:34,508 --> 00:18:36,476
of a 1 0-megaton overblast.

239
00:18:36,543 --> 00:18:38,773
Well, then the tapes and
pictures of my parents--

240
00:18:38,846 --> 00:18:41,440
Are still down there.

241
00:18:41,515 --> 00:18:43,642
ohh...

242
00:18:43,717 --> 00:18:45,651
oh, MacDonald.

243
00:18:45,719 --> 00:18:48,654
I want to see
what they look like.

244
00:18:48,722 --> 00:18:51,987
I suppose
every orphan does.

245
00:18:53,060 --> 00:18:55,153
I want to hear

246
00:18:55,229 --> 00:18:57,663
what they thought
and knew.

247
00:19:00,234 --> 00:19:02,327
The city's radioactive.

248
00:19:03,904 --> 00:19:07,169
oh, yeah, well...
Iet me see.

249
00:19:07,241 --> 00:19:10,176
Who is there
among your people

250
00:19:10,244 --> 00:19:12,678
who knows something
about radioactivity?

251
00:19:12,746 --> 00:19:14,179
No one.

252
00:19:15,582 --> 00:19:17,516
And among mine?

253
00:19:20,254 --> 00:19:23,621
Who knows everything
about everything?

254
00:19:25,259 --> 00:19:29,753
oh...
oh, Virgil.

255
00:19:29,830 --> 00:19:32,025
Go find him.

256
00:19:33,801 --> 00:19:36,861
Lisa, you remember
your parents.

257
00:19:36,937 --> 00:19:40,566
I was too young when
they died to remember mine.

258
00:19:40,641 --> 00:19:43,576
I don't want to have
to remember my husband.

259
00:19:43,644 --> 00:19:45,077
I want to
love him now.

260
00:19:45,145 --> 00:19:47,773
Well, Virgil
will be with us.

261
00:19:47,848 --> 00:19:51,079
Now, we'll take good care.

262
00:19:51,151 --> 00:19:52,584
Say good-bye
to Cornelius.

263
00:19:52,653 --> 00:19:55,588
I don't want him
to know I'm afraid.

264
00:20:00,060 --> 00:20:01,459
Cornelius.

265
00:20:05,632 --> 00:20:07,259
Cornelius.

266
00:20:10,170 --> 00:20:11,432
Cornelius.

267
00:20:14,675 --> 00:20:15,607
Father.

268
00:20:17,678 --> 00:20:19,612
I'm going
on a journey.

269
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:22,945
What will you
bring me back?

270
00:20:23,016 --> 00:20:24,745
What would you like?

271
00:20:27,888 --> 00:20:29,822
More nuts
for my squirrel.

272
00:20:29,890 --> 00:20:31,323
He's growing fast.

273
00:20:31,392 --> 00:20:33,326
So are you.

274
00:20:34,728 --> 00:20:39,563
one day, you will be
as tall as a king.

275
00:20:45,472 --> 00:20:46,530
Mandemus.

276
00:20:47,674 --> 00:20:49,107
He's asleep.

277
00:20:49,176 --> 00:20:51,110
Not eternally,
I trust.

278
00:20:51,178 --> 00:20:52,702
Mandemus.

279
00:20:54,915 --> 00:20:55,847
Who's there?

280
00:20:55,916 --> 00:20:57,076
Caesar.

281
00:21:05,325 --> 00:21:07,259
What does
Caesar want?

282
00:21:07,327 --> 00:21:08,760
Weapons.

283
00:21:08,829 --> 00:21:10,763
For what purpose?

284
00:21:10,831 --> 00:21:12,264
For self-protection

285
00:21:12,332 --> 00:21:14,459
in the pursuit
of knowledge.

286
00:21:14,535 --> 00:21:16,469
Self-protection
against whom or what?

287
00:21:16,537 --> 00:21:18,471
We don't know.

288
00:21:18,539 --> 00:21:21,167
Well, then what is the point
of protecting yourself

289
00:21:21,241 --> 00:21:23,869
against a danger ofwhich
you have no knowledge

290
00:21:23,944 --> 00:21:26,674
in pursuit of a knowledge
you do not possess?

291
00:21:26,747 --> 00:21:28,544
oh, God.

292
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:33,185
Is it a knowledge
for good or evil?

293
00:21:33,253 --> 00:21:35,585
All knowledge
is for good.

294
00:21:35,656 --> 00:21:38,955
only the use to which you
put it can be good or evil.

295
00:21:39,026 --> 00:21:40,459
Well put.

296
00:21:40,527 --> 00:21:41,585
Thank you.

297
00:21:41,662 --> 00:21:43,721
The sun is rising.

298
00:21:43,797 --> 00:21:46,994
I should like to get this
matter settled before it sets.

299
00:21:47,067 --> 00:21:49,058
Caesar has appointed me

300
00:21:49,136 --> 00:21:51,036
not only as the keeper
of this armory,

301
00:21:51,104 --> 00:21:53,732
but as the keeper
of his own conscience.

302
00:21:53,807 --> 00:21:57,299
That is why I have asked
six boring questions

303
00:21:57,377 --> 00:21:59,368
and now propose
to ask a seventh

304
00:21:59,446 --> 00:22:03,815
before issuing or not issuing
the weapons you require.

305
00:22:03,884 --> 00:22:05,317
What is the nature
of the knowledge

306
00:22:05,385 --> 00:22:08,354
you cannot seek
without weapons?

307
00:22:08,422 --> 00:22:10,185
The knowledge of
Earth's ultimate fate

308
00:22:10,257 --> 00:22:11,690
recorded on tapes

309
00:22:11,758 --> 00:22:13,419
in the archives of
the forbidden city...

310
00:22:13,494 --> 00:22:15,428
Which is
contaminated,

311
00:22:15,496 --> 00:22:18,932
but still may be
inhabited by humans.

312
00:22:18,999 --> 00:22:20,523
Hmm. Come in.

313
00:22:26,006 --> 00:22:27,940
Name your
protective pick.

314
00:22:28,008 --> 00:22:29,942
Three submachine guns.

315
00:22:30,010 --> 00:22:30,977
For?

316
00:22:31,044 --> 00:22:33,142
The removal
of obstacles.

317
00:22:33,276 --> 00:22:34,800
Hmm.

318
00:22:36,379 --> 00:22:37,539
1 ...

319
00:22:39,382 --> 00:22:40,815
2...

320
00:22:42,385 --> 00:22:43,818
3.

321
00:22:43,887 --> 00:22:45,320
Now what?

322
00:22:45,388 --> 00:22:46,821
Ammunition.

323
00:22:46,890 --> 00:22:50,826
I really don't hold
with knowing the future,

324
00:22:50,894 --> 00:22:53,829
even my own
which is short.

325
00:22:53,897 --> 00:22:55,330
A geiger counter.

326
00:22:55,398 --> 00:22:58,333
I mean, ifwe knew for a fact
there was an afterlife,

327
00:22:58,401 --> 00:23:00,426
and that the afterlife
was bliss eternal,

328
00:23:00,503 --> 00:23:03,734
we'd all commit suicide in
order to be able to enjoy it.

329
00:23:06,743 --> 00:23:07,801
Pistols.

330
00:23:09,245 --> 00:23:11,236
To remove
smaller obstacles?

331
00:23:11,314 --> 00:23:13,748
It's a 3-dayjourney.

332
00:23:13,816 --> 00:23:15,841
With Caesar's permission,
MacDonald may want to

333
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:18,251
shoot, cook,
and eat a rabbit.

334
00:23:18,321 --> 00:23:20,255
But who needs
three pistols

335
00:23:20,323 --> 00:23:22,257
to shoot one rabbit?

336
00:23:24,060 --> 00:23:26,085
Enjoyyour meal.

337
00:23:26,162 --> 00:23:27,754
Thank you.

338
00:23:30,333 --> 00:23:33,769
He may be old, but he's
got a mind like a razor.

339
00:23:33,836 --> 00:23:36,771
When I was a boy,
he was my teacher.

340
00:23:36,839 --> 00:23:40,297
Let's collect our stores
and be on our way.

341
00:24:38,568 --> 00:24:40,502
There it is...

342
00:24:40,570 --> 00:24:42,162
or was.

343
00:24:42,238 --> 00:24:46,902
Like a storm at sea,
but solidified.

344
00:24:46,976 --> 00:24:50,673
By a bomb from an armory
1 ,000 times the size of ours.

345
00:24:50,747 --> 00:24:53,443
And nobody to keep
its owner's conscience.

346
00:25:16,773 --> 00:25:18,638
This is the hell

347
00:25:18,708 --> 00:25:22,405
my forefathers
used to speak about.

348
00:26:06,589 --> 00:26:09,490
[Geiger Counter Ticking]

349
00:26:13,563 --> 00:26:16,293
Do you know where
we are, MacDonald?

350
00:26:16,365 --> 00:26:17,832
Yes.

351
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:22,496
Now, this is--
I mean was--1 1th Avenue.

352
00:26:22,572 --> 00:26:26,508
Ape Management was
2 blocks east from here.

353
00:26:26,576 --> 00:26:29,067
The archives section,
2 blocks west,

354
00:26:29,145 --> 00:26:31,238
corner of Breck
and Agamon.

355
00:26:31,314 --> 00:26:32,611
Get us there quickly.

356
00:26:32,682 --> 00:26:34,343
[Ticking]

357
00:27:09,519 --> 00:27:11,851
The governor's very
irritable lately.

358
00:27:11,921 --> 00:27:13,548
Who wouldn't be,
living in this hell

359
00:27:13,623 --> 00:27:15,591
of radiation
for all these years?

360
00:27:15,658 --> 00:27:18,627
If the bomb hadn't
killed the old governor,

361
00:27:18,694 --> 00:27:20,787
boredom certainly
would have.

362
00:27:20,863 --> 00:27:24,765
Alma, I just want somebody
to talk to, anybody.

363
00:27:24,834 --> 00:27:27,428
We are at best brave

364
00:27:27,503 --> 00:27:30,438
and at worst mad
to be here.

365
00:27:30,506 --> 00:27:32,440
This background
radiation alone

366
00:27:32,508 --> 00:27:35,944
will give us
300 roentgens per hour.

367
00:27:36,012 --> 00:27:37,445
Meaning?

368
00:27:37,513 --> 00:27:41,449
That unless we leave
this place within 2 hours,

369
00:27:41,517 --> 00:27:43,314
we shall become inmates.

370
00:27:43,386 --> 00:27:45,377
This is a ghost city.

371
00:27:45,454 --> 00:27:46,944
I want to put
some flesh on it.

372
00:27:47,023 --> 00:27:48,957
Radioactive flesh?

373
00:27:51,460 --> 00:27:56,159
Well, we're all radiated,
but at least we're active.

374
00:27:56,232 --> 00:27:59,463
[Ticking]

375
00:27:59,535 --> 00:28:01,901
[Ticking Gets Louder]

376
00:28:01,971 --> 00:28:04,906
It's getting stronger.
We must hurry.

377
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:12,479
[Alarm Beeps]

378
00:28:12,548 --> 00:28:16,985
oh, Governor, look!
F-6! F-6!

379
00:28:17,053 --> 00:28:20,989
[Beeping]

380
00:28:21,057 --> 00:28:22,820
Alert Mendez.

381
00:28:24,060 --> 00:28:27,461
Mendez to control room.
Mendez to control room.

382
00:28:27,530 --> 00:28:31,864
Mendez to control room.

383
00:28:31,934 --> 00:28:35,529
Somebody's breached the
warning system at entry F-6.

384
00:28:35,605 --> 00:28:37,038
one of our scavengers.

385
00:28:37,106 --> 00:28:38,334
No. It's been
locked foryears.

386
00:28:38,407 --> 00:28:39,567
It couldn't have
been one of us.

387
00:28:39,642 --> 00:28:41,200
It must have
been someone else.

388
00:28:41,277 --> 00:28:43,336
Well, that's impossible.
There is no one else.

389
00:28:43,412 --> 00:28:45,437
We must act quickly.

390
00:28:45,514 --> 00:28:47,379
- Alma.
- Yes, sir?

391
00:28:47,450 --> 00:28:49,782
Work the B console.

392
00:28:49,852 --> 00:28:52,912
Quick, Mendez. Quick! Quick!

393
00:28:52,989 --> 00:28:56,117
oh, quicker! Faster!

394
00:28:56,192 --> 00:28:59,218
[Ticking]

395
00:29:03,065 --> 00:29:04,726
Keep going.

396
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:06,392
No, no. Back.

397
00:29:09,338 --> 00:29:11,363
This is the place.

398
00:29:16,279 --> 00:29:19,214
That's Caesar,

399
00:29:19,282 --> 00:29:22,718
come back to reconquer
his kingdom.

400
00:29:22,785 --> 00:29:26,221
Doesn't he know that
the bomb did that?

401
00:29:29,191 --> 00:29:33,560
[Ticking]

402
00:29:33,629 --> 00:29:36,530
[Ticking Gets Louder]

403
00:29:38,601 --> 00:29:40,535
We're still all right.

404
00:29:40,603 --> 00:29:42,298
This way.

405
00:29:45,241 --> 00:29:46,868
Quicker!

406
00:29:46,942 --> 00:29:48,239
Quicker!

407
00:29:49,845 --> 00:29:51,972
There. Hold it.

408
00:29:52,048 --> 00:29:55,142
Can anything live
down here for long?

409
00:29:55,217 --> 00:29:56,650
oh, yes.

410
00:29:56,719 --> 00:29:58,732
But in the end,
not recognizably.

411
00:29:58,732 --> 00:29:59,391
But in the end,
not recognizably.

412
00:29:59,467 --> 00:30:02,197
The black man
is the brother

413
00:30:02,269 --> 00:30:06,433
of my predecessor's
personal assistant.

414
00:30:06,507 --> 00:30:08,873
He supervised
the archives.

415
00:30:08,943 --> 00:30:12,470
I don't think
I know the orangutan.

416
00:30:21,489 --> 00:30:22,922
Look!

417
00:30:22,990 --> 00:30:24,890
It's been there foryears.

418
00:30:24,959 --> 00:30:28,224
The late governor had this whole
place equipped with cameras

419
00:30:28,295 --> 00:30:31,492
to forestall ape conspiracies,
as I remember.

420
00:30:31,599 --> 00:30:33,157
Hmm.

421
00:30:33,234 --> 00:30:34,394
Archives.

422
00:30:34,468 --> 00:30:37,403
We haven't been in
there since, uh...

423
00:30:37,471 --> 00:30:40,304
I wonder what the devil
they want in there.

424
00:30:41,575 --> 00:30:43,304
We'll find the tape
that we're looking for

425
00:30:43,377 --> 00:30:46,540
under the heading of
" Presidential Commission."

426
00:31:00,528 --> 00:31:03,656
" Proceedings of the
Presidential Commission

427
00:31:03,731 --> 00:31:05,528
on Alien Visitors,

428
00:31:05,599 --> 00:31:07,760
1 973."

429
00:31:09,503 --> 00:31:11,266
Is this it?

430
00:31:11,338 --> 00:31:12,430
Let's see.

431
00:31:12,506 --> 00:31:13,803
Yes, that's it.

432
00:31:13,874 --> 00:31:15,501
Now, if this thing works,

433
00:31:15,576 --> 00:31:16,804
the picture should come out

434
00:31:16,877 --> 00:31:18,811
on that screen over there.

435
00:31:26,387 --> 00:31:28,378
All security forces, alert.

436
00:31:28,455 --> 00:31:30,514
All security forces, alert.

437
00:31:30,591 --> 00:31:33,526
Check out all sections
in areas M-5.

438
00:31:33,594 --> 00:31:36,529
Apprehend 3 strangers
you will find there:

439
00:31:36,597 --> 00:31:38,963
one human and two apes.

440
00:31:39,033 --> 00:31:41,968
But caution.
I repeat, caution.

441
00:31:42,036 --> 00:31:44,732
If they resist,
you may shoot,

442
00:31:44,805 --> 00:31:46,932
but shoot to maim.

443
00:31:47,007 --> 00:31:48,838
We want them alive
for interrogation.

444
00:31:48,909 --> 00:31:53,471
Ifwe shoot, we break
1 2 years of peace.

445
00:31:57,151 --> 00:31:59,483
Yes, it has been rather
boring, hasn't it?

446
00:32:03,490 --> 00:32:04,787

447
00:32:04,858 --> 00:32:06,655
Who wonyour war?

448
00:32:06,727 --> 00:32:08,661
It wasn't our war.

449
00:32:08,729 --> 00:32:11,823
It was thegorillas' war.

450
00:32:11,899 --> 00:32:14,834
What didthespaceship's

452
00:32:17,137 --> 00:32:20,368
3950.

453
00:32:20,441 --> 00:32:23,672
And you talk to your pupils

454
00:32:23,744 --> 00:32:25,371
about eternity.

455
00:32:26,914 --> 00:32:28,814
There are only 3.

456
00:32:28,882 --> 00:32:31,612
There must be more,
but how many?

457
00:32:31,685 --> 00:32:34,984
We'll know
when we get them.

458
00:32:35,055 --> 00:32:37,455
My father.

459
00:32:38,859 --> 00:32:40,690
That's my father.

Theylearnedto refuse.

462
00:32:45,165 --> 00:32:48,191
On a historic day,
an apespoke a word

463
00:32:48,268 --> 00:32:51,897
which hadbeenspoken

Hesaid, "no. "

465
00:33:00,381 --> 00:33:03,214
No wonder all of mankind
thirsted for my blood

466
00:33:03,283 --> 00:33:05,080
and wanted
my birth aborted.

467
00:33:05,152 --> 00:33:08,519
I n the year 3950,
apes will destroy Earth.

468
00:33:08,589 --> 00:33:10,921
Not apes, gorillas.

469
00:33:10,991 --> 00:33:13,050
Besides, that's
only one future.

470
00:33:13,127 --> 00:33:15,789
How can there be
more than one?

471
00:33:15,863 --> 00:33:18,354
You remember
the old motorways?

472
00:33:18,432 --> 00:33:21,458
I believe that time is like
an endless motorway

473
00:33:21,535 --> 00:33:25,631
with an infinite number of lanes all
running from the past into the future.

474
00:33:25,706 --> 00:33:29,972
A driver could
change his lanes

475
00:33:30,044 --> 00:33:31,944
and change
his future.

476
00:33:32,012 --> 00:33:35,311
If you left
this room right now,

477
00:33:35,382 --> 00:33:38,078
you might
wind up shot dead.

478
00:33:38,152 --> 00:33:39,312
If you left
a minute later,

479
00:33:39,386 --> 00:33:41,047
you might survive.

480
00:33:41,121 --> 00:33:43,715
It's a blind choice,

481
00:33:43,791 --> 00:33:47,693
but you can
change lanes.

482
00:33:47,761 --> 00:33:51,697
I know what it is
I want to change.

[Rattle]

486
00:34:05,579 --> 00:34:08,104
The camera. It moved.

487
00:34:08,182 --> 00:34:10,707
Are you sure?

488
00:34:10,784 --> 00:34:13,344
Virgil's right.

489
00:34:15,589 --> 00:34:18,285
Governor, wejust
lost the TV monitor.

490
00:34:18,358 --> 00:34:21,293
I'm not interested
in equipment failures.

491
00:34:21,361 --> 00:34:24,819
It wasn't a failure.
It was destroyed, sir.

492
00:34:47,354 --> 00:34:50,187
We've got to find
another way out of here.

493
00:34:50,257 --> 00:34:51,690
Is there
another way?

494
00:34:56,597 --> 00:34:59,532
They got past you?
Then shoot on sight.

495
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:01,534
Never mind about
bringing them here.

496
00:35:01,602 --> 00:35:02,796
J ust get them.

497
00:35:02,870 --> 00:35:05,600

escape alive!

Sections 2-5
and R-7 and 8,

499
00:35:09,943 --> 00:35:11,535
form a group here.
Quick! Quick!

00:35:11,612 --> 00:35:13,409
All right, move out!

501
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:15,880
Move! Move! Move!

502
00:35:15,949 --> 00:35:17,382
Hurry!

503
00:35:17,451 --> 00:35:18,884
Run!

504
00:35:18,952 --> 00:35:20,385
Run!

505
00:35:22,523 --> 00:35:24,991
I've got your guns.

506
00:35:25,058 --> 00:35:26,992
We need another patrol.

507
00:35:27,060 --> 00:35:28,459
Quickly, men.
Hurry. Hurry.

508
00:35:28,529 --> 00:35:31,498
The rest of you go
to M-5.

509
00:35:31,565 --> 00:35:33,726
What are you
waiting for?

510
00:35:33,801 --> 00:35:36,998
To R-8,
through the transverse!

511
00:36:02,062 --> 00:36:03,654
Aah!

512
00:36:48,375 --> 00:36:51,139
All forces
into exit level 3.

513
00:36:51,211 --> 00:36:53,941
They're getting away!
Kill them!

514
00:36:54,014 --> 00:36:56,574
Kill them! Kill them!

[Gunshot]

516
00:40:01,692 --> 00:40:06,459
You knew every bolt and nut
in those corridors.

517
00:40:06,530 --> 00:40:10,432
You have 1 00 armed men.
How could they escape?

518
00:40:10,501 --> 00:40:13,595
They were fast
and smart, Governor Kolp.

519
00:40:13,671 --> 00:40:15,263
Many of my men
were sick,

520
00:40:15,339 --> 00:40:17,671
and the chimp
surprised us.

521
00:40:17,741 --> 00:40:20,972
Yeah. He surprised
me too, once,

522
00:40:21,045 --> 00:40:23,809
But he's an animal.
He's only an animal.

523
00:40:23,881 --> 00:40:24,813
No, Governor.

524
00:40:24,882 --> 00:40:26,213
He's more
than an animal.

525
00:40:26,283 --> 00:40:27,773
He can speak.

526
00:40:27,852 --> 00:40:28,910
So can they all.

527
00:40:28,986 --> 00:40:31,011
So speech
makes them human?

528
00:40:31,088 --> 00:40:33,181
Speech makes them
intelligent,

529
00:40:33,257 --> 00:40:36,658
and intelligence may make them
not human, but humane.

530
00:40:36,727 --> 00:40:38,126
Perhaps they
came in peace.

531
00:40:38,195 --> 00:40:39,628
Idiot.
They were armed.

532
00:40:39,697 --> 00:40:41,130
From what we saw
on the monitor,

533
00:40:41,198 --> 00:40:43,132
only for their
self-protection.

534
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:45,395
Let them
return in peace.

535
00:40:45,469 --> 00:40:46,629
To where?

536
00:40:46,704 --> 00:40:48,035
To wherever they live.

537
00:40:48,105 --> 00:40:50,801
So they can return to
exterminate those of us

538
00:40:50,875 --> 00:40:52,809
the bomb hasn't
already exterminated?

539
00:40:52,877 --> 00:40:54,071
Where do they live?

540
00:40:54,145 --> 00:40:56,306
They came with
few provisions.

541
00:40:56,380 --> 00:40:57,574
It can't be far.

542
00:40:57,648 --> 00:40:58,774
Which way
did they head?

543
00:40:58,849 --> 00:41:00,510
They headed north,
Governor.

544
00:41:00,584 --> 00:41:01,983
organize
scout parties,

545
00:41:02,052 --> 00:41:04,043
assemble
workable equipment,

546
00:41:04,121 --> 00:41:05,679
and follow them
to their camp.

547
00:41:05,756 --> 00:41:08,691
Yes, Governor Kolp.

548
00:41:08,759 --> 00:41:12,217
Why, Governor?

549
00:41:12,296 --> 00:41:15,754
So that we
can exterminate them.

550
00:41:22,373 --> 00:41:24,307
Stop!
It's Caesar!

551
00:41:24,375 --> 00:41:27,640
We should have
stayed in the city.

552
00:41:27,711 --> 00:41:29,474
Visiting the city
is forbidden.

553
00:41:29,547 --> 00:41:32,015
I know.
I forbade it.

554
00:41:32,082 --> 00:41:33,276
Then why?

555
00:41:33,350 --> 00:41:36,012
Aldo, if a king forbids his
subjects to wear a crown,

556
00:41:36,086 --> 00:41:38,111
that doesn't mean
he can't wear one himself.

557
00:41:38,189 --> 00:41:39,520
Caesar is Caesar.

558
00:41:39,590 --> 00:41:41,717
He went to the city
for a reason.

559
00:41:41,792 --> 00:41:43,817
What reason?

560
00:41:43,894 --> 00:41:45,828
I went looking
for my past,

561
00:41:45,896 --> 00:41:48,831
but I found our future.

562
00:41:48,899 --> 00:41:50,332
Explain!

563
00:41:50,401 --> 00:41:52,835
You wouldn't understand.

564
00:41:52,903 --> 00:41:56,339
Aldo will make
the future--with this!

565
00:41:56,407 --> 00:41:59,843
Well, then Aldo
may very soon

566
00:41:59,910 --> 00:42:02,208
be in the past.

567
00:42:02,279 --> 00:42:04,144
Hee hee.

568
00:42:04,215 --> 00:42:05,648
Hee hee.

569
00:42:05,716 --> 00:42:07,149
Hee hee.

570
00:42:09,420 --> 00:42:12,412
Aah!

571
00:42:20,731 --> 00:42:22,164
Cornelius!

572
00:42:23,767 --> 00:42:26,497
Cornelius,
are you all right?

573
00:42:27,771 --> 00:42:30,035
No, Mother.
I'm just dead.

574
00:42:30,107 --> 00:42:31,972
Dead?

575
00:42:32,042 --> 00:42:33,270
We were playing war.

576
00:42:33,344 --> 00:42:35,278
War? Cornelius,
hasn't your father explained

577
00:42:35,346 --> 00:42:37,780
that war is not a game?

578
00:42:37,848 --> 00:42:39,816
Yes, Mother.

579
00:42:39,883 --> 00:42:42,374
Hasn't he also forbidden
you to play with guns?

580
00:42:42,453 --> 00:42:43,852
Yes, Mother.

581
00:42:43,921 --> 00:42:45,718
Then you'll stop it.

582
00:42:45,789 --> 00:42:47,222
Yes, Mother.

583
00:42:47,291 --> 00:42:49,725
Now, come along.
Father wants us.

584
00:44:11,909 --> 00:44:15,367
My friends,
I have convened

585
00:44:15,446 --> 00:44:18,176
this extraordinary meeting
of the council

586
00:44:18,248 --> 00:44:19,943
in order that I may
report upon an action

587
00:44:20,017 --> 00:44:23,180
which I deemed necessary:

588
00:44:23,253 --> 00:44:26,518
a reconnaissance expedition
to the forbidden city

589
00:44:26,590 --> 00:44:29,855
with Virgil and MacDonald
as my aides.

590
00:44:29,927 --> 00:44:32,555
Why MacDonald?
Why not a soldier?

591
00:44:32,629 --> 00:44:34,824
Because we went in peace

592
00:44:34,898 --> 00:44:37,059
to what we thought
would be a dead city.

593
00:44:37,134 --> 00:44:39,364
But in case
there were some survivors,

594
00:44:39,436 --> 00:44:40,801
we took MacDonald with us

595
00:44:40,871 --> 00:44:42,498
so that he could parley
with them

596
00:44:42,573 --> 00:44:45,440
and secure permission
for our search.

597
00:44:45,509 --> 00:44:47,272
Survivors there are...

598
00:44:47,344 --> 00:44:49,039
maimed,

599
00:44:49,113 --> 00:44:51,104
mutated,

600
00:44:51,181 --> 00:44:53,206
hostile,

601
00:44:53,283 --> 00:44:55,148
and human.

602
00:44:55,219 --> 00:44:57,084
Did the humans
followyou here?

603
00:44:57,154 --> 00:44:58,485
We saw no sign of it,

604
00:44:58,555 --> 00:45:00,580
but we must prepare
for the day

605
00:45:00,657 --> 00:45:02,050
when they may
come out of the city,

606
00:45:02,184 --> 00:45:04,778
when they may come
to find us.

607
00:45:09,691 --> 00:45:13,491
No humans in council!
No humans in council!

608
00:45:13,562 --> 00:45:15,120
- No!
- No!
- No!

609
00:45:15,197 --> 00:45:16,596
- No!
- No!

610
00:45:16,665 --> 00:45:17,996
- No!
- No!
- No!

611
00:45:18,066 --> 00:45:20,000
- No!
- No!

612
00:45:20,068 --> 00:45:22,002
- No!
- No!

613
00:45:22,070 --> 00:45:24,004
- No!
- No!

614
00:45:24,072 --> 00:45:26,802
- No!
- No!
- No!

615
00:45:26,875 --> 00:45:27,967
Yes!

616
00:45:28,043 --> 00:45:30,170
They are here
because I sent for them.

617
00:45:30,245 --> 00:45:32,372
Now that we know the danger,

618
00:45:32,447 --> 00:45:34,415
we need their help
and their counsel.

619
00:45:34,483 --> 00:45:36,747
- No!
- No!
- No!

620
00:45:36,819 --> 00:45:38,309
Yes!

621
00:45:38,387 --> 00:45:43,620
Come. We shall not sit
in council with humans.

622
00:45:56,205 --> 00:45:59,766
Now, let us
reason together

623
00:45:59,842 --> 00:46:02,504
and make plans.

624
00:46:02,578 --> 00:46:04,603
Governor, somewhere
along the line of history,

625
00:46:04,680 --> 00:46:07,649
this bloody chain reaction
has got to stop.

626
00:46:07,716 --> 00:46:11,015
A destroys B, B destroys C,
C destroys A

627
00:46:11,086 --> 00:46:13,748
and is destroyed
by D, who destroys E.

628
00:46:13,822 --> 00:46:15,983
Before anyone knows
where they are,

629
00:46:16,058 --> 00:46:18,458
there won't be anyone left
to know anything anywhere.

630
00:46:18,527 --> 00:46:21,553
Governor, the captain
has come back.

631
00:46:21,630 --> 00:46:24,895
We found it, Governor.
We found Ape City.

632
00:46:24,967 --> 00:46:25,934
Where?

633
00:46:29,004 --> 00:46:31,438
This is
a gorilla outpost.

634
00:46:31,506 --> 00:46:33,440
Below is a valley
with orchards and vineyards,

635
00:46:33,508 --> 00:46:34,600
enough to feed hundreds.

636
00:46:34,676 --> 00:46:35,768
Here is Ape City.

637
00:46:35,844 --> 00:46:37,277
Was it very large?

638
00:46:37,346 --> 00:46:38,938
It is of a size we
can deal with, sir.

639
00:46:39,014 --> 00:46:40,106
Were you seen?

640
00:46:40,182 --> 00:46:41,171
No, sir.

641
00:46:41,250 --> 00:46:43,445
Caesar was too busy
with a council ofwar.

642
00:46:43,518 --> 00:46:45,452
one day soon, they'll
be coming for us.

643
00:46:45,520 --> 00:46:47,454
No. We're going
after them--now.

644
00:46:47,522 --> 00:46:48,887
Captain, you
have your orders.

645
00:46:50,025 --> 00:46:53,461
Caesar, on the night
of the fires,

646
00:46:53,528 --> 00:46:56,190
you swore an oath
that in the future

647
00:46:56,265 --> 00:46:59,962
apes and humans would live
together in kindness and peace.

648
00:47:00,035 --> 00:47:03,300
Why are you now making
every sort of preparation

649
00:47:03,372 --> 00:47:04,304
to break that oath?

650
00:47:04,373 --> 00:47:07,706
Because unlike
the humans in our city,

651
00:47:07,776 --> 00:47:13,442
those in the
forbidden city are mad--

652
00:47:13,515 --> 00:47:17,144
mad enough not to want
peace and friendship,

653
00:47:17,219 --> 00:47:19,585
but enmity and war.

654
00:47:19,655 --> 00:47:21,885
Did they tell you that?

655
00:47:21,957 --> 00:47:23,288
oh, yes. Yes.

656
00:47:23,358 --> 00:47:25,292
By opening fire on us

657
00:47:25,360 --> 00:47:26,884
without giving us
a chance to explain.

658
00:47:26,962 --> 00:47:29,556
You were trespassing
on their territory.

659
00:47:29,631 --> 00:47:32,566
But, Lisa, we didn't know
the city was inhabited.

660
00:47:32,634 --> 00:47:36,331
But how, if you
didn't speak to them,

661
00:47:36,405 --> 00:47:38,965
do you know its
inhabitants are mad?

662
00:47:39,041 --> 00:47:41,566
Lisa, you
didn't see them.

663
00:47:41,643 --> 00:47:45,909
They're...oh...
They're malformed.

664
00:47:45,981 --> 00:47:49,382
Like the freaks in your
foster father's circus?

665
00:47:49,451 --> 00:47:50,884
Were they mad?

666
00:47:50,953 --> 00:47:52,420
What's malformed?

667
00:47:52,487 --> 00:47:54,421
Cornelius, go to bed.

668
00:47:54,489 --> 00:47:56,923
I'm giving
Riki his water.

669
00:47:56,992 --> 00:48:01,053
Lisa, freaks
are different.

670
00:48:01,129 --> 00:48:04,530
These humans are
the end product

671
00:48:04,599 --> 00:48:06,430
of nuclear radiation.

672
00:48:07,803 --> 00:48:12,502
They are mutant,
and they're mad.

673
00:48:15,077 --> 00:48:17,102
Keep all emergency
channels open.

674
00:48:17,179 --> 00:48:19,147
Yes, Governor. All emergency
channels will remain open.

675
00:48:19,214 --> 00:48:21,648
If anything
should miscarry,

676
00:48:21,717 --> 00:48:24,151
I'll signal you
as arranged.

677
00:48:24,219 --> 00:48:25,811
Yes, sir.

678
00:48:25,887 --> 00:48:28,185
Hurry, man.
We need it!

679
00:48:34,830 --> 00:48:37,731
The school bus will be
operational, Governor.

680
00:48:37,799 --> 00:48:38,959
The rest of the convoy

681
00:48:39,034 --> 00:48:40,501
will join us
atjunction C.

682
00:48:40,569 --> 00:48:42,400
Get moving.

Well...

00:50:04,786 --> 00:50:07,254
they have guns.

687
00:50:07,322 --> 00:50:09,256
We have no guns.

688
00:50:09,324 --> 00:50:12,020
We shall take the guns,

689
00:50:12,094 --> 00:50:14,688
and we shall beat them.

[All Growling]

691
00:50:23,271 --> 00:50:25,739
We are the elite.

00:50:25,807 --> 00:50:27,707
We are the super-race.

693
00:50:27,776 --> 00:50:30,711
We have
the right to lead.

694
00:50:30,779 --> 00:50:34,545
Without us,
there would be no army.

Guns are power!

701
00:51:06,715 --> 00:51:09,411
We shall get them,

702
00:51:09,484 --> 00:51:12,078
and we'll beat them
with guns.

703
00:51:12,154 --> 00:51:14,349
We will smash

Look!

every word we said.

How is Cornelius?

727
00:54:39,224 --> 00:54:41,158
Hurt. He's badly hurt.

728
00:55:33,745 --> 00:55:35,178
oh!

729
00:55:37,316 --> 00:55:38,715
oh!

730
00:56:15,420 --> 00:56:17,354
Speak the truth.

731
00:56:24,096 --> 00:56:27,031
Even ifwe had
a hospital...

732
00:56:32,270 --> 00:56:36,206
I'm not going to
tell Caesar, notyet.

733
00:56:36,274 --> 00:56:40,734
He still believes
he can change the future.

734
00:56:55,427 --> 00:57:00,888
Humans, going
towards our city.

735
00:57:04,369 --> 00:57:06,530
I'll get him.

736
00:57:11,143 --> 00:57:12,440
Aah!

737
00:57:36,923 --> 00:57:38,584
Get ready to fire.

738
00:57:38,658 --> 00:57:39,625
Fire!

739
00:58:14,627 --> 00:58:17,494
The doctor
is doing her best.

740
00:58:17,563 --> 00:58:20,498
I don't believe
Cornelius can live.

741
00:58:20,566 --> 00:58:21,999
Caesar does.

742
00:58:22,068 --> 00:58:24,935
He refuses
to leave his side.

743
00:58:25,004 --> 00:58:26,437
MacDonald, how can
a benevolent God

744
00:58:26,505 --> 00:58:28,166
allow a branch
of his own tree

745
00:58:28,241 --> 00:58:30,368
to crack and injure
an innocent child?

746
00:58:30,443 --> 00:58:34,937
It didn't crack, Virgil.
It was cut.

747
00:58:35,014 --> 00:58:38,506
order at council!
order! order!

748
00:58:38,584 --> 00:58:40,677
The humans
are attacking.

749
00:58:40,753 --> 00:58:44,519
They've killed one gorilla
and wounded another.

750
00:58:44,590 --> 00:58:45,648
Tell them.

751
00:58:45,725 --> 00:58:48,751
We were scouting
desert approaches to the city

752
00:58:48,828 --> 00:58:50,523
and saw their army.

753
00:58:50,596 --> 00:58:55,192
They fired.
My companion was killed.

754
00:58:55,268 --> 00:58:56,895
I have come
to warn you.

755
00:58:56,969 --> 00:58:59,164
And how long before
they get here?

756
00:58:59,238 --> 00:59:00,170
Soon.

757
00:59:00,239 --> 00:59:02,264
So now,
we must prepare.

758
00:59:02,341 --> 00:59:03,501
Take the humans out.

759
00:59:03,576 --> 00:59:05,271
Lock them all
in the corral.

760
00:59:05,344 --> 00:59:08,336
Aldo! Aldo,
you can't do this!

761
00:59:08,414 --> 00:59:11,349
You're acting against
Caesar's orders.

762
00:59:12,518 --> 00:59:15,078
Caesar is not here.

763
00:59:30,169 --> 00:59:32,103
Hey! What the--

764
00:59:32,171 --> 00:59:33,604
Hey!

765
00:59:37,176 --> 00:59:38,768
Jake.

766
00:59:38,844 --> 00:59:42,109
Strongman, take him
to the corral.

767
00:59:44,483 --> 00:59:46,678
Take all humans
to the corral.

768
00:59:49,422 --> 00:59:52,357
Take all humans
to the corral.

769
00:59:57,229 --> 01:00:00,858
All humans, take them
to the corral.

770
01:00:08,240 --> 01:00:10,174
Where are you going?

771
01:00:10,242 --> 01:00:12,676
Martial law
has been declared.

772
01:00:12,745 --> 01:00:14,679
Everybody is to stay
in their homes.

773
01:00:14,747 --> 01:00:16,180
By whose orders?

774
01:00:16,248 --> 01:00:18,148
Go home!

775
01:00:21,554 --> 01:00:27,959
We want guns!
Guns are power.

776
01:00:28,027 --> 01:00:30,757
Now we go and get guns!

777
01:00:30,830 --> 01:00:32,320
Mandemus.

778
01:00:32,398 --> 01:00:33,990
Who's there?

779
01:00:34,066 --> 01:00:36,000
Aldo.
General Aldo.

780
01:00:38,070 --> 01:00:39,503
What do you want?

781
01:00:39,572 --> 01:00:41,506
Guns! Guns!

782
01:00:41,574 --> 01:00:44,509
What will you do
with them?

783
01:00:44,577 --> 01:00:47,512
We shall do with them
what we will.

784
01:00:47,580 --> 01:00:48,842
" Do what you will"
is the devil's law.

785
01:00:48,914 --> 01:00:51,508
And who are you,
Mandemus, God?

786
01:00:51,584 --> 01:00:53,484
I am the keeper
of Caesar's conscience.

787
01:00:53,552 --> 01:00:55,486
And I am the keeper
of Caesar's army!

788
01:00:55,554 --> 01:00:56,987
Under allegiance to Caesar!

789
01:00:57,056 --> 01:00:58,489
Where is he?

790
01:00:58,557 --> 01:00:59,819
Mandemus,
as I speak,

791
01:00:59,892 --> 01:01:02,156
our city is being
attacked by humans

792
01:01:02,228 --> 01:01:03,320
from without
and within.

793
01:01:03,396 --> 01:01:04,988
Who cares
where Caesar is?

794
01:01:05,064 --> 01:01:05,996
I care!

795
01:01:06,065 --> 01:01:07,498
There is a law
that weapons

796
01:01:07,566 --> 01:01:08,999
may only be issued
from this armory

797
01:01:09,068 --> 01:01:11,002
under direct orders
from Caesar

798
01:01:11,070 --> 01:01:12,298
and not under threats

799
01:01:12,371 --> 01:01:14,498
from one of his
thicker-headed subordinates

800
01:01:14,573 --> 01:01:17,542
for whom war means
only personal glory.

801
01:01:17,610 --> 01:01:21,046
Now, find me Caesar.
I will listen to him.

802
01:01:21,113 --> 01:01:23,411
First,
listen to this.

803
01:01:27,720 --> 01:01:29,813
Take every gun
in the place, everything.

804
01:01:29,889 --> 01:01:31,447
Get the ammo boxes.

805
01:01:31,524 --> 01:01:34,152
Get the handguns,
grenades.

806
01:01:34,226 --> 01:01:37,286
Stop! Stop!
Caesar forbids you!

807
01:01:37,363 --> 01:01:38,955
Ah!

808
01:01:50,543 --> 01:01:53,478
Well, there it is:
Ape City.

809
01:01:53,546 --> 01:01:54,672
When we leave,

810
01:01:54,747 --> 01:01:57,648
I don't want to see
one tree left standing,

811
01:01:57,716 --> 01:01:59,149
2 pieces ofwood
nailed together,

812
01:01:59,218 --> 01:02:00,981
or anything left alive.

813
01:02:01,053 --> 01:02:05,513
I want it to look like
that city we came from.

814
01:02:07,359 --> 01:02:10,988
What the devil is all
that rubbish down there?

815
01:02:11,063 --> 01:02:13,258
It looks like some sort
of barricade, sir.

816
01:02:13,332 --> 01:02:16,358
Nothing that a couple of
flame bombs won't take care of.

817
01:02:31,016 --> 01:02:32,278
Caesar, forgive me,

818
01:02:32,351 --> 01:02:34,546
but I couldn't
get here before now.

819
01:02:34,620 --> 01:02:35,951
Aldo has seized power.

820
01:02:36,021 --> 01:02:37,818
He's broken
into the armory

821
01:02:37,890 --> 01:02:40,450
and imprisoned all
humans in the corral.

822
01:02:40,526 --> 01:02:42,460
MacDonald?

823
01:02:42,528 --> 01:02:43,517
He was dragged from
the council meeting

824
01:02:43,596 --> 01:02:45,086
by Aldo's gorillas.

825
01:02:47,366 --> 01:02:49,960
I can't leave
Cornelius.

826
01:02:50,035 --> 01:02:51,127
He needs me.

827
01:02:51,203 --> 01:02:55,469
Every ape and human
in Ape City needs you now.

828
01:02:55,541 --> 01:02:58,738
I think you should go
to Cornelius.

829
01:03:07,953 --> 01:03:09,614
Father?

830
01:03:09,688 --> 01:03:14,387
They...hurt me.

831
01:03:16,795 --> 01:03:21,391
They want...to hurt you.

832
01:03:24,403 --> 01:03:26,564
Who hurt you?

833
01:03:26,639 --> 01:03:28,163
The humans?

834
01:03:30,409 --> 01:03:31,842
No.

835
01:03:33,412 --> 01:03:35,133
Then who?

836
01:03:35,267 --> 01:03:37,292
Sh...

837
01:03:39,204 --> 01:03:41,798
Shall...

838
01:03:41,874 --> 01:03:44,308
Shall I be...

839
01:03:44,376 --> 01:03:46,674
malformed?

840
01:03:49,882 --> 01:03:51,315
No.

841
01:03:54,386 --> 01:03:58,550
one day
you are going to be

842
01:03:58,624 --> 01:04:01,525
as tall as a king.

843
01:04:25,851 --> 01:04:27,785
[Sob]

844
01:04:57,115 --> 01:05:00,050
All right, Captain,
lay the smoke screen.

845
01:05:00,118 --> 01:05:03,053
When I give the signal,
start the bombardment.

846
01:05:03,121 --> 01:05:06,113
Men and equipment
out of the bus.

847
01:05:06,191 --> 01:05:08,125
Deployyour weapons,
quickly!

848
01:05:09,594 --> 01:05:12,028
All is
in order, sir.

849
01:05:12,097 --> 01:05:14,031
All right. Let's go.

850
01:05:28,313 --> 01:05:31,373
He said
they hurt him.

851
01:05:31,450 --> 01:05:34,886
Who?
Who would hurt him?

852
01:05:36,455 --> 01:05:39,390
I think you'll
have your answer,

853
01:05:39,458 --> 01:05:41,392
and soon.

854
01:05:43,962 --> 01:05:46,089
What do you know?

855
01:05:46,164 --> 01:05:47,995
That's what I know.

856
01:06:15,894 --> 01:06:17,725
You did this.

857
01:06:17,796 --> 01:06:19,229
For security.

858
01:06:19,297 --> 01:06:22,733
Did you also raid the armory
for the same reason?

859
01:06:22,801 --> 01:06:24,359
For security!

860
01:06:24,436 --> 01:06:26,267
Caesar, Caesar!

861
01:06:27,839 --> 01:06:29,773
I orderyou
to stop this!

862
01:06:29,841 --> 01:06:31,775
I orderyou
to stop it now

863
01:06:31,843 --> 01:06:33,640
and release
those people!

864
01:06:39,418 --> 01:06:42,819
See? Aldo was right.
War has come.

865
01:06:42,888 --> 01:06:44,321
Let's go.

866
01:06:55,267 --> 01:06:57,827
Aah! Aah! Aah!

867
01:07:16,221 --> 01:07:19,452
Go to the barricade!
To the barricade!

868
01:07:19,524 --> 01:07:21,719
[Gunfire]

869
01:07:45,150 --> 01:07:46,583
Come on!

870
01:07:46,651 --> 01:07:48,084
Go to the barricade!

871
01:09:00,025 --> 01:09:02,755
They're laying
a smoke screen.

872
01:09:13,805 --> 01:09:15,739
Here they come.

873
01:09:43,374 --> 01:09:44,807
Where's Aldo?

874
01:09:44,876 --> 01:09:48,539
Probably the other side
of the valley by now.

875
01:10:18,610 --> 01:10:21,306
Hurry! Fall back,
fall back!

876
01:10:22,947 --> 01:10:26,144
Fall back.
Go back to the village.

877
01:10:30,555 --> 01:10:34,355
Get away from the fire!
Fall back! Hurry!

878
01:10:34,425 --> 01:10:36,450
Leave the barricade!

879
01:10:36,528 --> 01:10:41,659
Fall back! Fall back!
Get back to the village.

880
01:11:39,757 --> 01:11:43,523
Nothing left alive!

881
01:11:43,595 --> 01:11:46,928
You can't stay here
any longer.

882
01:11:46,998 --> 01:11:49,762
You must
save yourself.

883
01:13:01,039 --> 01:13:02,370
Ah!

884
01:13:10,315 --> 01:13:11,976
Caesar.

885
01:13:17,188 --> 01:13:19,486
Your people
weakened our city

886
01:13:19,557 --> 01:13:22,253
by rebelling against
your human masters.

887
01:13:22,327 --> 01:13:27,196
But we who survive
will create a new race,

888
01:13:27,265 --> 01:13:29,927
and you and yours
will be brought low,

889
01:13:30,001 --> 01:13:34,370
and you shall
learn again

890
01:13:34,439 --> 01:13:37,738
what it is to have a master.

891
01:13:37,809 --> 01:13:39,174
Ha!

892
01:13:39,243 --> 01:13:42,974
You're learning
already...

893
01:13:43,047 --> 01:13:46,414
clever ape.

894
01:13:49,387 --> 01:13:50,877
oh, no.

895
01:13:52,490 --> 01:13:54,321
Ape.

896
01:13:54,392 --> 01:13:56,758
Clever ape.

897
01:13:58,296 --> 01:14:01,697
But then,
you always were clever.

898
01:14:01,766 --> 01:14:05,566
I was told how
you chose your own name.

899
01:14:05,636 --> 01:14:08,628
But every Caesar
must have his Brutus.

900
01:14:08,706 --> 01:14:09,968
Did you know that, ape?

901
01:14:10,041 --> 01:14:12,942
Do you
understand that, ape?

902
01:14:13,010 --> 01:14:18,175
And now Ape City is
about to lose its king.

903
01:14:19,784 --> 01:14:20,944
No, Kolp! No!

904
01:14:26,424 --> 01:14:28,289
Now fight like apes!

905
01:15:02,794 --> 01:15:04,955
Stop! Stop. No killing.

906
01:15:05,029 --> 01:15:06,792
Take them captive.

907
01:15:14,939 --> 01:15:16,372
Get moving!

908
01:15:18,609 --> 01:15:21,305
No, no!
Don't kill them.

909
01:15:21,379 --> 01:15:23,438
Take them prisoner.

910
01:15:32,864 --> 01:15:34,297
No.

911
01:15:35,367 --> 01:15:37,130
No, Virgil.

912
01:15:50,382 --> 01:15:55,445
All right, Virgil.
Let's go.

913
01:16:00,825 --> 01:16:04,420
No prisoners.
No prisoners!

[Gunfire]

915
01:16:17,409 --> 01:16:19,001
Dismount.

916
01:16:44,169 --> 01:16:45,636
Hail Caesar!

917
01:16:45,704 --> 01:16:47,797
Hail Caesar!

918
01:16:47,872 --> 01:16:50,033
Hail Caesar!

919
01:16:50,108 --> 01:16:51,632
Hail Caesar!

920
01:16:51,710 --> 01:16:54,042
Hail Caesar!

921
01:16:54,112 --> 01:16:55,636
Caesar!

922
01:16:55,714 --> 01:16:58,046
Caesar!

923
01:16:58,116 --> 01:17:00,141
Caesar!

924
01:17:00,218 --> 01:17:01,651
Caesar!

925
01:17:01,720 --> 01:17:03,119
Caesar!

926
01:17:03,188 --> 01:17:04,348
Caesar!

927
01:17:04,422 --> 01:17:06,390
Caesar!

928
01:17:06,458 --> 01:17:08,653
Caesar!

929
01:17:08,727 --> 01:17:11,161
We've done it!

930
01:17:11,229 --> 01:17:13,163
Hold!

931
01:17:13,231 --> 01:17:15,927
Let the humans go,
Virgil, all of them.

932
01:17:16,001 --> 01:17:17,195
No!

933
01:17:32,851 --> 01:17:34,341
They stay.

934
01:17:34,419 --> 01:17:36,887
Aldo says what we do now.

935
01:17:36,955 --> 01:17:39,480
They have done nothing.
They shall go free.

936
01:17:39,557 --> 01:17:41,457
You like humans?

937
01:17:41,526 --> 01:17:43,426
You want them
out of the corral?

938
01:17:43,495 --> 01:17:45,690
All right. Kill them!

939
01:17:45,764 --> 01:17:47,197
Aah!

940
01:17:47,265 --> 01:17:48,391
Kill them.

941
01:17:48,466 --> 01:17:51,094
Kill them all.

942
01:17:52,504 --> 01:17:53,869
Stop.

943
01:17:53,938 --> 01:17:55,428
Stop.

944
01:17:55,507 --> 01:17:59,273
No more killing, Aldo.
Put down your weapons.

945
01:17:59,344 --> 01:18:01,437
Take them back
to the armory.

946
01:18:01,513 --> 01:18:02,639
No! We shall
keep the guns!

947
01:18:02,714 --> 01:18:06,150
Move, Caesar,
or we shall kill you.

949
01:18:29,674 --> 01:18:32,609
Ape has never
killed ape,

950
01:18:32,677 --> 01:18:35,612
Iet alone
an ape child.

952
01:18:46,524 --> 01:18:49,322
Aldo has killed
an ape child.

953
01:18:49,394 --> 01:18:51,828
The branch
did not break.

954
01:18:51,896 --> 01:18:54,831
It was cut...
with a sword.

957
01:19:18,356 --> 01:19:20,085
Aldo.

958
01:19:21,493 --> 01:19:24,462
You...you killed.

959
01:19:24,529 --> 01:19:25,826
Ah! Ah!

960
01:19:27,699 --> 01:19:30,725
Aldo killed.

962
01:19:32,704 --> 01:19:37,573

[All Growling]

964
01:19:40,545 --> 01:19:42,445
our child.

965
01:19:43,515 --> 01:19:45,574
He killed our child.

01:19:45,650 --> 01:19:47,641
What's the matter
with them?

967
01:19:47,719 --> 01:19:52,088
I guess you might say they
justjoined the human race.

968
01:19:52,157 --> 01:19:54,625
Ape has killed ape.

969
01:19:54,692 --> 01:19:57,126

1000
01:22:24,192 --> 01:22:25,750
Aah!

1001
01:22:37,038 --> 01:22:40,474
Should one murder
be avenged by another?

1002
01:22:40,542 --> 01:22:42,976
only the future
can tell.

1003
01:22:43,044 --> 01:22:46,070
So let us
start building it.

1004
01:23:13,141 --> 01:23:16,167
Ifwe appear to be lacking
in gratitude, Caesar,

1005
01:23:16,244 --> 01:23:19,179
what have we
to be grateful for?

1006
01:23:19,247 --> 01:23:20,737
If you mean
to set us free,

1007
01:23:20,816 --> 01:23:22,807
then free us
completely.

1008
01:23:22,884 --> 01:23:24,351
What do you mean?

1009
01:23:24,419 --> 01:23:27,582
We are not
your children, Caesar.

1010
01:23:27,656 --> 01:23:29,556
We have a destiny, too--

1011
01:23:29,624 --> 01:23:32,092
as equals,
respecting each other,

1012
01:23:32,160 --> 01:23:33,889
Iiving together,
with love.

1013
01:23:33,962 --> 01:23:36,089
Love?

1014
01:23:36,164 --> 01:23:40,965
The human way
is violence and death.

1015
01:23:41,036 --> 01:23:45,632
Aldo wasn't human,
was he, Caesar?

1016
01:23:48,109 --> 01:23:49,667
Virgil...

1017
01:23:51,246 --> 01:23:55,342
you are
a good and wise ape.

1018
01:23:59,221 --> 01:24:03,885
And you, Caesar, are
a good and wise king.

1019
01:24:03,959 --> 01:24:07,725
We'll rebuild what's ruined
and begin again.

1020
01:24:07,796 --> 01:24:09,730
Tell me something,
MacDonald.

1021
01:24:09,798 --> 01:24:13,734
Can we make the future
what we wish?

1022
01:24:13,802 --> 01:24:16,737
I've heard that
it's possible, Caesar.

1023
01:24:23,345 --> 01:24:28,248
There. Every weapon
is back in its proper place.

1024
01:24:28,316 --> 01:24:31,444
Caesar, I want
to ask a favor.

1025
01:24:31,519 --> 01:24:34,044
This armory's been
my home for 27 years.

1026
01:24:34,122 --> 01:24:36,283
You may live in it for
the rest of your days.

1027
01:24:36,358 --> 01:24:38,417
But I don't want
to live in it.

1028
01:24:38,493 --> 01:24:41,485
No, no. Now that
the danger is over,

1029
01:24:41,563 --> 01:24:45,226
I want to see it
destroyed. Blown up.

1030
01:24:45,300 --> 01:24:50,101
The greatest danger of all
is that danger never ends.

1031
01:24:50,171 --> 01:24:53,607
And so, Mandemus,

1032
01:24:53,675 --> 01:24:57,270
we must be patient...
and wait.

1033
01:24:58,580 --> 01:25:02,380
We still wait,
my children.

1034
01:25:02,450 --> 01:25:05,544
But as I look at
apes and humans

1035
01:25:05,620 --> 01:25:10,489
Iiving in friendship,
harmony, and at peace

1036
01:25:10,558 --> 01:25:14,324
now some 600 years
after Caesar's death,

1037
01:25:14,396 --> 01:25:17,627
at least we wait
with hope for the future.

1038
01:25:17,699 --> 01:25:20,759
Lawgiver, who knows
about the future?

1039
01:25:23,138 --> 01:25:26,403
Perhaps only the dead.
