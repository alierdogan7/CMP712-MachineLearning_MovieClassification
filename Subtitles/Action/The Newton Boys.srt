01:04:03,755 --> 01:04:05,393
I don't know...

834
01:04:05,995 --> 01:04:08,714
I don't know how we got out alive, Lou.

835
01:04:22,475 --> 01:04:24,193
Hey, I know that gal.

836
01:04:24,355 --> 01:04:26,789
Went to Sunday school with her.

837
01:04:29,195 --> 01:04:30,833
In Parsons.

838
01:04:41,755 --> 01:04:44,189
How much you think was in those bags?

839
01:04:47,115 --> 01:04:49,675
Whatever it is, it ain't worth it.

840
01:04:57,555 --> 01:05:00,274
"All four wounded bank employees
have been treated."

841
01:05:00,435 --> 01:05:02,869
WILLIS:
Bunch of stupid, thick-headed Canucks.

842
01:05:03,035 --> 01:05:07,074
"Six bandits got away
with an estimated $200,000."

843
01:05:07,275 --> 01:05:08,549
Hell, maybe 80.

844
01:05:08,715 --> 01:05:12,390
The Canucks are pencil-whipping
insurance companies just like back home.

845
01:05:12,555 --> 01:05:14,352
Tell me, who's the criminals here?

846
01:05:14,515 --> 01:05:18,110
"They are believed to be American,
one thought to be critically wounded.

847
01:05:18,315 --> 01:05:21,512
Police are combing
hospitals and doctors' offices...

848
01:05:21,715 --> 01:05:25,151
...hoping to find the perpetrators
of this shocking crime."

849
01:05:25,355 --> 01:05:28,950
Wouldn't have been a shocking crime
if they'd just dropped the bags.

850
01:05:29,595 --> 01:05:31,950
Okay, you got a bag.
Out of nowhere comes a gun.

851
01:05:32,155 --> 01:05:33,634
What do you do? Drop the bag.

852
01:05:33,835 --> 01:05:36,395
I pick it up, I'm gone.
How hard is that?

853
01:05:36,635 --> 01:05:38,512
Goddamn.

854
01:05:38,995 --> 01:05:40,189
Willis?

855
01:05:43,915 --> 01:05:47,112
You have to promise me
this was the last bank robbery.

856
01:05:47,355 --> 01:05:50,074
Damn right it was the last bank robbery.

857
01:05:50,275 --> 01:05:53,312
Because from now on,
it's the oil business, and that's it.

858
01:05:57,755 --> 01:05:59,154
You're crazy.

859
01:05:59,355 --> 01:06:01,471
Why don't you tell me
about this oil well?

860
01:06:01,675 --> 01:06:02,790
- This oil well?
- Yeah.

861
01:06:02,955 --> 01:06:04,593
- It's out in west Texas.
- Yeah?

862
01:06:04,755 --> 01:06:06,632
- I even got a name for it.
- What is it?

863
01:06:06,835 --> 01:06:08,029
I'll give you one guess.

864
01:06:09,955 --> 01:06:12,594
MAN: The big outfits been using them
high-dollar rotary rigs.

865
01:06:12,835 --> 01:06:17,113
WILLIS: I don't care.
I put everything I got into this here rig.

866
01:06:17,675 --> 01:06:19,154
Where's my oil?

867
01:06:19,315 --> 01:06:22,512
Hell, Mr. Wilson, they done stuck
too many straws in this soda.

868
01:06:22,715 --> 01:06:24,353
There ain't no pressure left.

869
01:06:24,515 --> 01:06:26,392
Let me see if I got this straight.

870
01:06:26,555 --> 01:06:30,150
I put your ass in charge. I've been
paying you top dollar for over a year.

871
01:06:30,315 --> 01:06:33,990
Today, you tell me I got
a chickenshit rig, I'm getting outdrilled.

872
01:06:34,155 --> 01:06:36,510
You got nothing to show for it
but a dry hole?

873
01:06:36,715 --> 01:06:38,990
No, there was oil down there.
They got it all!

874
01:06:39,155 --> 01:06:43,273
Ain't a damn thing I can do about it.
Let me just put it to you simple.

875
01:06:43,475 --> 01:06:47,912
Just like an old sow's belly:
six tits, seven pigs.

876
01:06:48,115 --> 01:06:50,390
Looks like you're number seven.

877
01:06:52,315 --> 01:06:54,670
Well, so who do we go after?

878
01:06:54,995 --> 01:06:57,350

Go ahead! That's Standard Oil over there.

Go on, get him while you're at it.
Big city boys with deep pockets.

882
01:07:09,515 --> 01:07:14,509
Hell, boy, you ain't gonna get enough oil
out of that hole to part your hair.

883
01:07:16,835 --> 01:07:18,314
That goes for all of you.

01:07:35,075 --> 01:07:37,794
- You know where Jess run off to?
- I got a good idea.

01:07:37,995 --> 01:07:40,555

it's Booger Red's Wild West show.

It's entertainment for the entire family,
an education for the children.

You'll see the star-spangled pig.

892
01:07:50,475 --> 01:07:52,113
- First place.
JOE: He can't read.

893
01:07:52,275 --> 01:07:54,709
First place. Three times this week.

894
01:07:54,875 --> 01:07:58,754
Looks good, big snakes, but we got
a real job for you. Are you ready to go?

895
01:07:58,955 --> 01:08:01,230
I got a job doing what I like.

896
01:08:02,795 --> 01:08:06,674

Oh.

We're broke, Jess.

901
01:08:24,195 --> 01:08:25,514
Yeah.

What are we gonna do?

903
01:08:29,395 --> 01:08:30,794
We're gonna rob something.

904
01:08:30,955 --> 01:08:32,832
Yeah, all right.

905
01:08:34,635 --> 01:08:36,512
That well was a duster.

906
01:08:37,075 --> 01:08:39,350
- Oh, well, that explains it.
DOCK: Come on.

907

You run out of money
and you need me, Willis?

Well, at least I know where mine went.

Well, you never ask us anything, Willis.

Yeah. I'm talking about our children and
grandchildren not growing up on dirt.

01:26:35,715 --> 01:26:38,149
Went in between his heart and his lungs.

1159
01:26:41,235 --> 01:26:45,433
I'II, uh, I'll be back tomorrow
to work on the fractures in his arms.

1160

Keep quiet and don't get seen.

1161
01:26:47,635 --> 01:26:50,752

that's his problem.

01:26:54,755 --> 01:26:57,952

- They told me I could buy beer up here.

- Yeah, I got a name. Name's Will Reed.

1179

I'm an oil man, goddamn it.
I'm throwing a party. I came here...

1180

Party's all over, pal.

We got your buddies two hours ago.

1182

That was an awful big score
you guys made last night.

1183
01:29:54,475 --> 01:29:57,194
It's too bad half the world saw
you guys coming here.

in this scheme, all right?

You two seem like good old boys.

1188
01:30:11,875 --> 01:30:15,550
...but I can get my hands on
a nice chunk of it, if you're interested.

1189

They say the value
of money is all relative.

1190
01:30:23,395 --> 01:30:25,590
This, for instance, is only 10 smackers.

1191
01:30:26,875 --> 01:30:30,470
It's nothing compared
to the millions you crooks pinched.

1192

But...

01:30:33,435 --> 01:30:36,029
...it can pack a pretty hefty wallop.

1194

She's just bringing the money.

about every time I let her down...

on that train.

must have tipped them.

your old pal Glasscock...

I'm gonna put it to you square.

We got to figure some way out of this.

Willis, I got a file
as thick as your arm there...

1355
01:42:49,155 --> 01:42:52,352
...on jobs you fellows pulled
all across the country.

one hell of a gang.

But I'm sure some people
in the Justice Department...

...might be interested
in digging up some old business.

- Lf I deal, do we walk?
- No, not right away.

Not on this one.

who will do the sentencing.

No, them bastards got their own money.
They can make their own deal.

01:43:34,235 --> 01:43:36,510
If Joe and Jess
make a good impression in court...

1371
01:43:36,715 --> 01:43:39,593
No, no. See, now,
Jess had nothing to do with this.

1372
01:43:39,755 --> 01:43:41,154
He was off running horses...

1373

the border to ride a pony on a bet.

They could get off with a year...

1378
01:43:57,715 --> 01:44:01,594
...but for that, I need
all the money back...

1379

that little weasel Bill Fahy.

You know us Newtons do a lot of things,
but there are a few things we don't do.

We don't kill nobody, we don't steal
from women and children...

...who actually
masterminded the robbery?

in the brown suit, William Fahy.

1399

with the business at hand.

of a guilty plea, Mr. Newton?

Uh, yes, sir, Your Honor.

and, you know, train robbing.

- Did you spend it?
- No, I didn't spend it. I buried it.

1485
01:54:01,195 --> 01:54:04,551
An old boy inside got scared
and wouldn't open up $200,000.

1486
01:54:04,715 --> 01:54:06,910
All he had to do
was put it in the handbag.

1487
01:54:07,115 --> 01:54:09,470
When I bawled him out,
we said, "We got enough."

1488
01:54:09,635 --> 01:54:11,193
I said, "We never get enough."

1489
01:54:11,395 --> 01:54:14,193
I said, "When I go in to get anything,
I want it all."

1490
01:54:14,355 --> 01:54:18,234
From then on, I went inside.
They was cleaned out when I come out.

1491
01:54:19,555 --> 01:54:22,115
When did they catch you?
Right after the 1924...

1492
01:54:22,275 --> 01:54:24,152
One of our men. It wasn't one of us.

1493
01:54:24,355 --> 01:54:26,710
It was one of the men
that was working with us.

1494
01:54:26,915 --> 01:54:30,954
He got excited, and he...
It had to be excitement.

1495
01:54:31,155 --> 01:54:34,989
He went up and across on the other side
where he wasn't supposed to be...

1496
01:54:35,155 --> 01:54:37,191
...and shot my brother,
one of my brothers.

1497
01:54:37,355 --> 01:54:39,391
CARSON: Killed him?
- No, no.

1498
01:54:39,555 --> 01:54:43,992
He shot him five or six times with a.45.
It should have killed him.

1499
01:54:44,235 --> 01:54:46,112
[LAUGHING]

1500
01:54:47,515 --> 01:54:50,313
- A.45 is a big-bore weapon.
JOE: Yeah.

1501
01:54:50,515 --> 01:54:53,393
That should have pretty well...
Your brother recovered?

1502
01:54:53,595 --> 01:54:56,189
Yeah, recovered
and lived to be 83 years old.

1503
01:54:56,355 --> 01:54:57,549
CARSON:
Yeah?

1504
01:54:59,275 --> 01:55:02,950
My mother was over in Cottonwood
one day, and she met my schoolteacher.

1505
01:55:03,115 --> 01:55:04,912
I had quit,
and she asked her why.

1506
01:55:05,115 --> 01:55:08,391
My mother said, "His clothes
got so bad, he was ashamed to go."

1507
01:55:08,595 --> 01:55:11,234
She said,
"He's the smartest pupil I ever had.

1508
01:55:11,435 --> 01:55:15,553
If you send him for an education, there's
no telling what he'll make of himself.

1509
01:55:15,755 --> 01:55:20,033
If he don't get his education,
there's no telling what he'll do."

1510
01:55:20,955 --> 01:55:22,911
CARSON: How old were you
when you started this?

1511
01:55:23,115 --> 01:55:24,594
Nineteen years old.

1512
01:55:24,795 --> 01:55:26,114
Nineteen years old.

1513
01:55:26,315 --> 01:55:28,510
When was the first time
you went to jail?

1514
01:55:28,715 --> 01:55:31,752
Uh, that Rondout train robbery.

1515
01:55:31,915 --> 01:55:33,394
CARSON: Yeah?
- Yeah.

1516
01:55:33,595 --> 01:55:36,314
I thought you were gonna put that on
and stick me up.

1517
01:55:36,915 --> 01:55:39,190
You thought I was gonna...
You thought l...

1518
01:55:39,395 --> 01:55:41,192
I thought you were.

1519
01:55:41,395 --> 01:55:45,070
I thought you were putting your
mask on and were gonna sort of...

1520
01:55:45,315 --> 01:55:48,432
Old habits die hard, don't they, Joe?
Let me ask you.

1521
01:55:48,635 --> 01:55:51,752
Looking back, if you had to do it over,
you wouldn't recommend...

1522
01:55:51,955 --> 01:55:56,710
No! We was crazy for doing it. I look
back and see then. But you're young then.

1523
01:55:56,875 --> 01:56:00,629
Then somebody said, "Why didn't you
invest that money into something?"

1524
01:56:00,835 --> 01:56:03,554
I said, "Who wants a better job
than what we already got?"

1525
01:56:03,755 --> 01:56:06,952
That's what we thought then.
Need money, go rob another bank.

1526
01:56:07,115 --> 01:56:11,154
- But you wouldn't recommend that...
- No, I wouldn't. That'd be crazy. Yeah.

1527
01:56:12,915 --> 01:56:17,352
When I first thought of robbing banks,
I never thought of hurting anybody.

1528
01:56:17,515 --> 01:56:21,474
I knew all of them bankers was rich,
and they didn't care about hurting...

1529
01:56:21,675 --> 01:56:25,634
They didn't care
about hurting us poor farmers.

1530
01:56:25,795 --> 01:56:28,229
So why should I care
about hurting them?

1531
01:56:28,795 --> 01:56:30,592
Why shouldn't I steal from them?

1532
01:56:30,755 --> 01:56:33,474
It's just one thief stealing from another.

1533
01:57:22,195 --> 01:57:24,186
