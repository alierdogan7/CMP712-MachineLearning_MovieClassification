Ripped By <i>SALMAN</i>

2
00:00:55,411 --> 00:00:58,441
As feudal Japan enjoys peace,
the samurai era is waning.

3
00:00:58,614 --> 00:01:01,668
But this fragile calm is threatened by
the growing power of Lord Naritsugu,

4
00:01:01,745 --> 00:01:04,366
the Shogun's sadistic younger brother.

5
00:01:04,552 --> 00:01:06,716
Sir Doi realizes
Naritsugu will ruin the Shogunate

6
00:01:06,790 --> 00:01:09,341
if he gains higher political standing.

7
00:01:09,522 --> 00:01:11,571
As Naritsugu's evil deeds are
quickly hushed up, Sir Doi must act.

8
00:02:58,642 --> 00:03:03,106
March 5, 1844 - Akashi Clan House Elder
Zusho Mamiya commits harakiri.

9
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:09,141
Mamiya's harakiri to the Shogun
was against Lord Naritsugu.

10
00:03:09,326 --> 00:03:12,042
Lord Naritsugu was born
with a vicious nature.

11
00:03:12,333 --> 00:03:18,401
His lust for flesh and
dishonorable conduct cannot be pardoned.

12
00:03:18,587 --> 00:03:20,488
What should we do?

13
00:03:21,439 --> 00:03:25,343
Shogun Council Elders,
Sir Doi has returned.

14
00:03:40,324 --> 00:03:49,200
The Shogun orders us to settle
the matter of his half- brother quietly.

15
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:54,272
SIR DOI
Top Shogun official

16
00:03:54,438 --> 00:04:01,078
We blame those that named Naritsugu
an adopted Akashi son.

17
00:04:01,279 --> 00:04:06,083
This dilemma drove Mamiya
to harakiri...

18
00:04:06,284 --> 00:04:10,888
- His appeal to us for action...
- I'm aware of that!

19
00:04:11,088 --> 00:04:16,761
But we must respect the Shogun's rule.

20
00:04:18,095 --> 00:04:21,399
His justice is noble
by heaven's will.

21
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:26,170
Arguing is pointless!

22
00:04:29,721 --> 00:04:36,758
13 ASSASSINS

23
00:04:55,967 --> 00:04:59,270
Shinzaemon Shimada, I presume?

24
00:05:00,338 --> 00:05:01,439
In the flesh.

25
00:05:04,375 --> 00:05:06,344
You're a hard man to find.

26
00:05:16,387 --> 00:05:17,889
Sir Doi.

27
00:05:19,023 --> 00:05:21,359
Sorry for the late hour.

28
00:05:21,559 --> 00:05:25,830
I've been a widower for years,
with few family obligations.

29
00:05:26,030 --> 00:05:28,566
SHINZAEMON
Shogun Samurai

30
00:05:28,599 --> 00:05:34,038
Perhaps you've heard about the outrage.

31
00:05:35,373 --> 00:05:36,674
I have.

32
00:05:40,111 --> 00:05:42,046
So...

33
00:05:43,614 --> 00:05:47,351
What do you make of Lord Naritsugu?

34
00:05:52,056 --> 00:05:54,592
Forgive my frankness...

35
00:05:54,792 --> 00:05:59,430
He is no worthy heir
to the noble Akashi clan.

36
00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:05,770
With the Shogun's consent,
I suggest Naritsugu steps down.

37
00:06:05,970 --> 00:06:08,739
A more suitable heir is needed.

38
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:13,244
The Shogun will not grant it.

39
00:06:13,444 --> 00:06:16,514
Why not?

40
00:06:16,714 --> 00:06:24,222
He has appointed Naritsugu
as his senior advisor,

41
00:06:24,422 --> 00:06:28,359
effective on Naritsugu's next visit
to Edo.

42
00:06:28,559 --> 00:06:34,031
The Shogun will allow that boy
to meddle in political affairs?

43
00:06:34,232 --> 00:06:40,238
Incidentally, I invited someone here...

44
00:06:40,438 --> 00:06:43,774
Speak with him.

45
00:06:57,855 --> 00:07:02,493
I'm Yukie Makino,
a subject of Lord of Owari.

46
00:07:02,693 --> 00:07:05,563
I serve the Agematsu in Kiso.

47
00:07:05,763 --> 00:07:07,798
I'm Shinzaemon Shimada.

48
00:07:07,999 --> 00:07:10,735
Kiso?

49
00:07:10,935 --> 00:07:16,774
I heard about an incident last year
between the Akashi and Owari clans.

50
00:07:16,974 --> 00:07:18,910
Rumors of a scandal....

51
00:07:19,110 --> 00:07:25,283
I'll tell you all.
I'll keep no secrets.

52
00:07:26,517 --> 00:07:30,655
In April of last year...

53
00:07:31,789 --> 00:07:36,761
Lord Naritsugu of the Akashi clan...

54
00:07:36,961 --> 00:07:43,334
stayed overnight at Kiso.

55
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:48,084
He is the son of the former Shogun.

56
00:07:48,472 --> 00:07:50,003
LORD NARlTSUGU
Akashi Clan ruler

57
00:07:50,103 --> 00:07:52,343
Nobility must be properly served...

58
00:07:52,577 --> 00:07:59,784
Our wives and daughters were
brought in for his full hospitality.

59
00:08:05,756 --> 00:08:06,991
Uneme.

60
00:08:07,191 --> 00:08:08,626
Father.

61
00:08:08,826 --> 00:08:10,995
- ls his feast in order?
- Yes.

62
00:08:11,229 --> 00:08:13,998
And the picture scrolls
for his entertainment.

63
00:08:14,198 --> 00:08:15,533
I'll fetch them.

64
00:08:15,733 --> 00:08:18,369
Have your wife get them instead.

65
00:08:24,041 --> 00:08:25,309
Chise.

66
00:08:27,044 --> 00:08:33,518
My son had married Chise
only two months prior.

67
00:08:33,718 --> 00:08:37,288
I ordered her to do this petty task.

68
00:08:37,455 --> 00:08:41,926
And I'll regret it to my grave.

69
00:08:47,231 --> 00:08:50,234
Who might you be?

70
00:08:50,434 --> 00:08:54,839
I belong to the Uneme Makino family.

71
00:08:57,775 --> 00:09:01,913
My Lord, please release me.

72
00:09:13,791 --> 00:09:15,726
Chise!

73
00:09:18,763 --> 00:09:20,431
Chise?

74
00:09:45,423 --> 00:09:48,392
Kiso women are such mountain monkeys.

75
00:09:48,593 --> 00:09:52,763
They defy me by scratching.

76
00:10:00,137 --> 00:10:02,974
Are you a monkey too, servant?

77
00:10:54,592 --> 00:10:58,629
Monkey necks can be so tough.

78
00:11:04,368 --> 00:11:06,838
That same night...

79
00:11:07,004 --> 00:11:12,043
Chise slit her throat in disgrace.

80
00:11:16,113 --> 00:11:18,850
My son and his new bride slain...

81
00:11:19,050 --> 00:11:23,054
before my very eyes.

82
00:11:28,459 --> 00:11:30,494
This is torture.

83
00:11:31,596 --> 00:11:34,832
Rather than living in disgrace
I ponder harakiri.

84
00:11:35,032 --> 00:11:40,371
But l can't... l remember the shame
my Lord Owari has endured.

85
00:11:43,474 --> 00:11:46,077
Mock me for grumbling.

86
00:11:46,277 --> 00:11:53,284
l continue my worthless life solely
to remain a living witness to this tragedy.

87
00:11:57,588 --> 00:12:01,959
As the Council Elder
enacting the Shogun's justice...

88
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:07,198
some things can do, others I cannot.

89
00:12:07,398 --> 00:12:14,772
If I turn my back on the Shogun
and find fault with his lineage,

90
00:12:14,972 --> 00:12:22,246
then his rule will spiral into chaos
an destroy years of peace.

91
00:12:25,683 --> 00:12:31,055
As the Shogun's senior advisor,
I cannot do it.

92
00:12:34,592 --> 00:12:38,629
Are you asking if I can do something?

93
00:12:38,829 --> 00:12:42,700
Since Mamiya's harakiri protest
three days ago...

94
00:12:44,602 --> 00:12:48,739
I've searched my soul for a solution.

95
00:12:54,645 --> 00:12:59,250
I have decided it's you.

96
00:13:24,575 --> 00:13:26,444
Who's the woman?

97
00:13:26,644 --> 00:13:32,016
Akashi land was once most fertile.

98
00:13:32,216 --> 00:13:37,555
But Naritsugu's relentless land taxes

99
00:13:37,722 --> 00:13:43,060
made starving peasants hunger
for revolt.

100
00:13:43,261 --> 00:13:46,330
This woman...

101
00:13:46,531 --> 00:13:52,170
is the daughter of the peasant leader.

102
00:14:00,244 --> 00:14:02,914
He did this...

103
00:14:03,114 --> 00:14:09,620
He cut off her limbs.

104
00:14:09,854 --> 00:14:15,493
And brought her to Edo
as his plaything.

105
00:14:16,561 --> 00:14:21,766
But he grew bored with her
and cast her out.

106
00:14:28,873 --> 00:14:31,242
Is there no mercy?

107
00:14:36,247 --> 00:14:44,355
Shinzaemon, l need not mention
my honor and position.

108
00:14:44,555 --> 00:14:51,562
If this continues, chaos will ruin
our nation and the people will suffer.

109
00:14:56,634 --> 00:15:01,572
Poor woman...
what of your family's fate?

110
00:15:19,790 --> 00:15:22,994
He cut out her tongue as well.

111
00:15:39,298 --> 00:15:43,422
TOTAL MASSACRE

112
00:15:58,362 --> 00:16:01,365
How fate smiles on me.

113
00:16:06,571 --> 00:16:11,209
As a samurai in this era of peace...

114
00:16:11,409 --> 00:16:14,679
I've been wishing for a noble death.

115
00:16:14,879 --> 00:16:18,115
Now fate has called me here.

116
00:16:20,084 --> 00:16:28,192
See, my hands won't stop trembling.

117
00:16:34,932 --> 00:16:39,337
It's a warrior's battle shakes.

118
00:17:02,627 --> 00:17:04,829
I will accomplish your wish...

119
00:17:05,863 --> 00:17:08,766
with magnificence.

120
00:17:10,067 --> 00:17:12,236
Sir Hanbei, thank you for coming.

121
00:17:12,436 --> 00:17:14,071
HANBEI
Naritsugu's Chief Samurai

122
00:17:14,138 --> 00:17:18,142
- Asakawa, where's Lord Naritsugu?
- In the banquet hall.

123
00:17:22,647 --> 00:17:24,248
The Mamiya?

124
00:17:25,616 --> 00:17:29,220
I told you not to trouble
the Mamiya family!

125
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:32,356
I can't disobey Lord Naritsugu's orders.

126
00:17:50,474 --> 00:17:52,310
My Lord!

127
00:17:54,245 --> 00:17:56,080
Yes, Hanbei?

128
00:17:56,280 --> 00:18:01,219
Sir Doi has humbly requested that you
leave the Mamiya family alone...

129
00:18:01,419 --> 00:18:03,721
Governmental orders!

130
00:18:03,921 --> 00:18:07,758
Doi again!
That grumbling Shogun advisor.

131
00:18:07,959 --> 00:18:09,393
Lord Naritsugu!

132
00:18:17,835 --> 00:18:21,336
What makes a samurai warrior?

133
00:18:23,774 --> 00:18:26,611
You men mindlessly chant
"loyalty, duty"...

134
00:18:26,811 --> 00:18:28,779
like a Buddhist prayer.

135
00:18:28,946 --> 00:18:32,083
But if servants are spoiled,

136
00:18:32,283 --> 00:18:35,686
then one day, they forget their duty
to serve.

137
00:18:35,887 --> 00:18:40,925
Servants like Mamiya make light
of their master and revolt.

138
00:18:45,363 --> 00:18:46,764
Punishing one's servants,

139
00:18:46,931 --> 00:18:49,867
who are certified as property
by the Shogun...

140
00:18:50,067 --> 00:18:54,205
Punishment is a master's duty.

141
00:18:59,544 --> 00:19:03,614
Dying for one's master
is the way of the samurai.

142
00:19:03,814 --> 00:19:08,953
Dying for one's husband
is the way of women.

143
00:19:20,498 --> 00:19:25,136
We must protect these ways,
right, Hanbei?

144
00:19:29,006 --> 00:19:30,308
Yes.

145
00:19:31,576 --> 00:19:34,212
They won't let him get away with it.

146
00:19:34,412 --> 00:19:38,249
Things worked out too easily
for our Lord, don't you think?

147
00:19:38,449 --> 00:19:41,152
He was given special treatment.

148
00:19:41,319 --> 00:19:47,859
Though born of a different mother,
he is still the Shogun's brother.

149
00:19:50,228 --> 00:19:52,763
So how will Sir Doi save face?

150
00:19:54,198 --> 00:19:57,068
As the man in charge of
the nation's justice...

151
00:19:58,102 --> 00:20:04,842
he must deliver a verdict to
save his honor in a scandal like this.

152
00:20:06,544 --> 00:20:10,848
So, Sir Doi is plotting something?

153
00:20:12,250 --> 00:20:13,451
Who goes there?

154
00:20:13,651 --> 00:20:19,724
Attendant Deguchi at your service.

155
00:20:21,292 --> 00:20:26,397
Gather men and spy on Sir Doi.

156
00:20:27,765 --> 00:20:30,234
Bribe the gatekeepers and servants.

157
00:20:31,269 --> 00:20:36,641
Get his list of visitors
since Mamiya's harakiri.

158
00:20:41,445 --> 00:20:44,048
We protect our Lord at all costs.

159
00:20:46,584 --> 00:20:49,921
Such is our duty.

160
00:20:53,324 --> 00:20:55,927
Yukie Makino of the Owari clan?

161
00:20:56,928 --> 00:20:59,530
Owari?

162
00:20:59,697 --> 00:21:01,966
Makino?

163
00:21:02,133 --> 00:21:06,304
Makino was present
during our Kiso visit.

164
00:21:06,470 --> 00:21:12,076
So Makino met with Shinzaemon.

165
00:21:14,779 --> 00:21:16,647
Do you know this Shinzaemon?

166
00:21:17,715 --> 00:21:23,087
We attended the same school, even
trained in the sword at the same dojo.

167
00:21:23,287 --> 00:21:26,390
We were competitive classmates.

168
00:21:26,524 --> 00:21:28,860
Is he that skilled?

169
00:21:29,026 --> 00:21:33,564
He's not as shrewd, not as strong.

170
00:21:33,764 --> 00:21:36,367
But he never gives up.

171
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:41,472
Backed into a corner, he won't budge.
Won't overplay his hand.

172
00:21:41,639 --> 00:21:46,210
He's a man who beats you in the end.

173
00:21:48,179 --> 00:21:51,696
If Doi has picked him...

174
00:21:52,350 --> 00:21:57,321
then we've drawn the worst luck.

175
00:22:25,694 --> 00:22:28,835
Impressive as always, Hirayama.

176
00:22:29,813 --> 00:22:34,957
I'm sorry for always borrowing
your dojo without permission.

177
00:22:35,133 --> 00:22:41,372
You honor me by using it.
Your spirit keeps the dojo alive.

178
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:44,702
A match for old time's sake?

179
00:22:45,736 --> 00:22:50,041
Better to save our energy
for bigger tasks, right?

180
00:22:51,142 --> 00:22:56,180
There are no big or small tasks.
All are equally important.

181
00:23:04,155 --> 00:23:05,656
You follow me?

182
00:23:07,124 --> 00:23:09,560
Guess you still lack training.

183
00:23:10,828 --> 00:23:17,201
Since your teaching, l have been on
the path of the sword for ten years.

184
00:23:18,970 --> 00:23:22,740
As the months and seasons changed...

185
00:23:22,940 --> 00:23:26,978
l lived on the money you gave me
as a sword for hire...

186
00:23:27,178 --> 00:23:32,416
knowing that, one day,
I'd surrender my life to you.

187
00:23:34,285 --> 00:23:38,890
l thought a time would come
when I could repay you.

188
00:23:40,291 --> 00:23:44,762
Yet I have no choice but to regret...

189
00:23:44,962 --> 00:23:50,134
l have not been able to
repay you, master.

190
00:23:53,504 --> 00:23:56,807
Your appreciation...

191
00:23:58,009 --> 00:24:01,312
My small contribution
means so much?

192
00:24:03,948 --> 00:24:05,583
I thank you.

193
00:24:06,617 --> 00:24:09,587
What a rare samurai in these times!

194
00:24:09,787 --> 00:24:12,023
Oh, Kuranaga!

195
00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:17,929
I'm Hirayama.

196
00:24:18,129 --> 00:24:20,164
We can't waste his spirit.

197
00:24:20,364 --> 00:24:22,867
Have him join us.

198
00:24:32,476 --> 00:24:37,481
l chose five of my men.
They await you inside.

199
00:24:42,854 --> 00:24:47,325
Mitsuhashi, get acquainted
with Hirayama.

200
00:24:50,161 --> 00:24:54,165
I am Mitsuhashi,
at your service.

201
00:24:57,001 --> 00:25:02,673
I present my subordinates,
Otake and Hioki.

202
00:25:02,874 --> 00:25:07,578
And my men, Higuchi and Horii.

203
00:25:08,779 --> 00:25:11,749
Hand-picked from hundreds.

204
00:25:12,783 --> 00:25:15,987
We are still few.

205
00:25:17,088 --> 00:25:21,726
It's hard to find skilled samurai
in this day and age.

206
00:25:22,793 --> 00:25:27,732
Others are samurai of little worth.

207
00:25:29,967 --> 00:25:34,372
Our five lives are in your hands,
Sir Shinzaemon.

208
00:25:34,572 --> 00:25:37,008
I see.

209
00:25:38,176 --> 00:25:44,115
Then listen up.
By private order of Sir Doi...

210
00:25:45,316 --> 00:25:50,955
we've been assigned to take the life
of Lord Naritsugu of the Akashi clan.

211
00:25:57,094 --> 00:26:02,733
Next month, Naritsugu will leave Edo
for the Akashi domain.

212
00:26:03,935 --> 00:26:07,572
If he enters Akashi land.
we can't touch him.

213
00:26:07,772 --> 00:26:10,141
So we strike en route?

214
00:26:10,341 --> 00:26:16,714
That's the plan. It's absurd
with so little time and few men.

215
00:26:16,914 --> 00:26:23,955
But these days. how many samurai
use their swords in actual battle?

216
00:26:25,156 --> 00:26:29,093
Not them, not us.
A real challenge.

217
00:26:30,928 --> 00:26:34,298
He who values his life dies
a dog's death.

218
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:38,269
You've entrusted me with your lives.

219
00:26:39,303 --> 00:26:44,108
I'll spend them at my disposal.

220
00:26:49,514 --> 00:26:51,749
Now, we are nine.

221
00:26:53,217 --> 00:26:58,823
How many other true samurai are left?

222
00:27:00,157 --> 00:27:03,661
I'll take my leave.

223
00:27:27,518 --> 00:27:30,354
What was that meeting?

224
00:27:31,989 --> 00:27:33,658
Akashi samurai?

225
00:27:34,992 --> 00:27:36,894
Now you know!

226
00:27:54,045 --> 00:27:57,381
How dare you point your sword
at us, novice!

227
00:27:57,582 --> 00:27:59,250
Who are you?

228
00:27:59,250 --> 00:28:01,085
State your name.

229
00:28:01,252 --> 00:28:05,022
Hirayama. I'm a ronin.

230
00:28:09,727 --> 00:28:12,763
He killed our sword masters
in one slice.

231
00:28:13,764 --> 00:28:19,003
I won't permit such blatant
moves again.

232
00:28:19,203 --> 00:28:22,540
If Sir Doi decides to,
the coals we once cooled...

233
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:27,044
will ignite into a blaze
burning down our clan!

234
00:28:27,245 --> 00:28:30,615
Forgive me for my thoughtless act.

235
00:28:30,815 --> 00:28:36,053
Now it's clear. It is Shinzaemon.

236
00:28:37,088 --> 00:28:39,457
Place your bets.

237
00:28:39,657 --> 00:28:42,727
Odd or even.

238
00:28:48,999 --> 00:28:50,119
Odd.

239
00:28:53,851 --> 00:28:54,971
Odd.

240
00:28:59,277 --> 00:29:01,846
Lady Luck is with you.

241
00:29:01,846 --> 00:29:04,027
Don't talk to me.

242
00:29:04,081 --> 00:29:05,432
What?

243
00:29:05,699 --> 00:29:08,335
Luck leaves when unlucky men talk.

244
00:29:29,207 --> 00:29:32,944
Shogun retainer Shimada's third son.

245
00:29:33,978 --> 00:29:38,249
Samurai are always asking
to borrow money.

246
00:29:38,449 --> 00:29:41,953
My shop is full of pawned swords.

247
00:29:42,186 --> 00:29:47,258
These days, swords are only good for
cutting radishes.

248
00:29:57,668 --> 00:30:00,738
Well, hello uncle!

249
00:30:03,374 --> 00:30:09,347
Womanizing at your age is bad form,
don't you think?

250
00:30:13,084 --> 00:30:18,055
Bravo Nephew! You young rogue.

251
00:30:21,559 --> 00:30:25,563
Sake bought with gambling money
tastes best.

252
00:30:25,763 --> 00:30:27,832
Spare me the irony.

253
00:30:28,933 --> 00:30:32,837
Gambling is the only time I feel alive.

254
00:30:33,871 --> 00:30:37,508
Samurai status doesn't suit me.

255
00:30:39,277 --> 00:30:41,979
I too hated being a samurai,
but then I realized...

256
00:30:42,180 --> 00:30:46,884
I could never be a true player
by playing around.

257
00:30:48,452 --> 00:30:51,422
A true player doesn't try so hard.

258
00:30:53,024 --> 00:30:55,059
I'm not trying too hard.

259
00:30:55,259 --> 00:30:57,195
I wonder.

260
00:30:59,297 --> 00:31:01,432
How's your girl?

261
00:31:03,997 --> 00:31:06,041
Well...

262
00:31:07,572 --> 00:31:10,441
she hasn't kicked me out yet.

263
00:31:11,976 --> 00:31:15,847
Be yourself.
But don't overdo it!

264
00:31:19,450 --> 00:31:23,754
Lords are making
their annual trips home.

265
00:31:23,955 --> 00:31:26,791
Shouldn't you be busy?

266
00:31:27,825 --> 00:31:31,596
Work is my excuse to gamble too.

267
00:31:33,497 --> 00:31:37,068
I'm on a mission, a long shot.

268
00:31:41,506 --> 00:31:43,574
Will that gamble pay off?

269
00:31:43,774 --> 00:31:50,047
Pay off? It's like walking through
the eye of a needle.

270
00:31:51,482 --> 00:31:54,986
Quit while you're ahead.

271
00:31:55,186 --> 00:31:57,154
You're clever.

272
00:31:57,355 --> 00:32:03,327
But your uncle is a born fool.
I go for broke and bet it all.

273
00:32:05,930 --> 00:32:07,932
And if you win?

274
00:32:10,368 --> 00:32:12,503
If by chance, I win...

275
00:32:15,006 --> 00:32:17,275
in time,
someone might appreciate me.

276
00:32:17,475 --> 00:32:20,178
Maybe.

277
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:29,587
Betting on yourself is true gambling.
Who's overdoing it now?

278
00:32:34,225 --> 00:32:36,928
I'll say this, Shinrokuro...

279
00:32:37,128 --> 00:32:45,002
My gamble is more exciting than yours,
with the same odds.

280
00:32:57,215 --> 00:33:00,785
Shinrokuro, are you home?

281
00:33:09,594 --> 00:33:14,932
You tease. If you're here, say so.

282
00:33:18,269 --> 00:33:22,206
I'm neither here nor there.

283
00:33:22,406 --> 00:33:26,811
No teasing. You're right here.

284
00:33:31,015 --> 00:33:33,050
I saw my uncle.

285
00:33:34,452 --> 00:33:37,388
Sir Shinzaemon?

286
00:33:38,589 --> 00:33:40,591
Yes.

287
00:33:48,299 --> 00:33:52,403
What's wrong?
Did something happen?

288
00:33:59,277 --> 00:34:01,212
Tsuya...

289
00:34:04,959 --> 00:34:06,958
No.

290
00:34:13,090 --> 00:34:14,930
Don't.

291
00:34:23,134 --> 00:34:24,602
Shinrokuro.

292
00:34:24,802 --> 00:34:27,238
I'll be gone for a while.

293
00:34:35,479 --> 00:34:39,951
When will you return?

294
00:34:41,519 --> 00:34:46,123
Soon. But if I'm late...

295
00:34:49,393 --> 00:34:52,578
I'll be at the Festival of the Dead.

296
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:58,936
Burn the honorary torch and wait.

297
00:35:10,781 --> 00:35:14,986
This is my one and only pupil.

298
00:35:15,186 --> 00:35:18,623
Ogura at your service.

299
00:35:18,823 --> 00:35:22,593
Are your parents still alive?

300
00:35:24,896 --> 00:35:29,834
Father died two years ago;
Mother passed when I was five.

301
00:35:31,169 --> 00:35:36,574
I come from a lowly family
serving a noble's concubine.

302
00:35:37,575 --> 00:35:41,445
Since deciding to live for the sword,
I've waited for this day...

303
00:35:41,646 --> 00:35:44,515
to use my skills for society.

304
00:35:46,984 --> 00:35:50,188
Allow me to join you.

305
00:35:50,388 --> 00:35:52,990
I request that you take him too.

306
00:35:54,192 --> 00:35:57,361
But he's too young.

307
00:35:57,562 --> 00:36:03,835
Shinzaemon, you're wrong.
Devotion knows no age.

308
00:36:04,836 --> 00:36:09,140
A samurai's life isn't measured
in length, is it?

309
00:36:11,209 --> 00:36:13,911
My logic was shallow.

310
00:36:15,346 --> 00:36:18,716
May we ask your help?

311
00:36:18,916 --> 00:36:21,352
Than you very much!

312
00:36:21,552 --> 00:36:24,555
I will surrender my life to serve you.

313
00:36:27,024 --> 00:36:29,427
And who might you be?

314
00:36:31,195 --> 00:36:34,599
Sahara, a lowly ronin...

315
00:36:34,799 --> 00:36:38,503
with no redeeming merit but my spear.

316
00:36:38,703 --> 00:36:41,672
I vouch only for his skill.

317
00:36:41,873 --> 00:36:44,041
Hirayama told me of your mission.

318
00:36:44,242 --> 00:36:50,515
Fighting a larger enemy is admirable.
I very much want to join but...

319
00:36:51,849 --> 00:36:54,752
One small request.

320
00:36:54,952 --> 00:36:56,354
Which is?

321
00:36:56,554 --> 00:36:59,423
Pay me 200 ryo up front.

322
00:36:59,624 --> 00:37:02,793
You're only joining for the money?

323
00:37:02,994 --> 00:37:08,366
Let me be clear. My sympathy with your
cause has nothing to do with money.

324
00:37:08,566 --> 00:37:14,972
With no relationship or debts to you,
do you expect me to work for free?

325
00:37:14,972 --> 00:37:18,229
How will you use the money?

326
00:37:18,566 --> 00:37:26,635
The first 120 ryo for lifelong debts, plus
something nice for my relatives.

327
00:37:26,635 --> 00:37:30,502
Thirty ryo for a tomb for my wife,
who died from my hardships.

328
00:37:30,502 --> 00:37:32,801
Twenty for my preparations as well.

329
00:37:32,801 --> 00:37:35,436
And the rest?

330
00:37:35,436 --> 00:37:41,375
To experience the ''luxuries''
I never had in this life.

331
00:37:43,868 --> 00:37:49,440
My kind of man.
His spirit is a bargain at 200.

332
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:52,577
Now, we're 11.

333
00:37:52,777 --> 00:37:57,582
Our quality outshines our quantity.

334
00:38:01,018 --> 00:38:03,154
Shinrokuro is here.

335
00:38:14,732 --> 00:38:18,636
I'll take the odds on your big gamble.

336
00:38:18,836 --> 00:38:20,471
What do you wager?

337
00:38:20,671 --> 00:38:23,808
If it's a true gamble,
there's only one thing I can bet.

338
00:38:32,817 --> 00:38:37,722
If you refuse, start by killing me now.

339
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:52,802
And now, we're 12!

340
00:39:13,124 --> 00:39:18,162
No mercy! There's no samurai code or
fair play in battle!

341
00:39:24,468 --> 00:39:28,773
No sword? Use a stick.
No stick? Use a rock.

342
00:39:28,973 --> 00:39:32,243
No rock?
Use your fists and feet!

343
00:39:32,443 --> 00:39:37,849
Lose your life.
but make the enemy pay!

344
00:39:39,550 --> 00:39:40,917
Horii.

345
00:39:42,854 --> 00:39:44,121
Higuchi.

346
00:39:45,122 --> 00:39:48,726
Train in explosives.

347
00:40:04,976 --> 00:40:07,545
Rest in peace.

348
00:40:08,946 --> 00:40:12,686
I'll join you shortly.

349
00:40:14,752 --> 00:40:20,591
Hurry up with the preparations.
We depart soon.

350
00:40:41,379 --> 00:40:44,782
Lord Naritsugu departs tomorrow.

351
00:40:45,016 --> 00:40:46,851
Finally, he makes a move.

352
00:40:47,018 --> 00:40:51,189
So where's our best point of attack?

353
00:40:51,355 --> 00:40:54,258
How about the Toda boat crossing?

354
00:40:54,458 --> 00:40:58,029
They'll send half their men first.

355
00:40:58,229 --> 00:41:01,866
The others will stand guard
as Naritsugu crosses.

356
00:41:02,066 --> 00:41:06,537
Their troops split...
Better to attack then.

357
00:41:06,737 --> 00:41:11,776
No, they'll be on full alert.
Won't make any wrong moves.

358
00:41:11,976 --> 00:41:17,949
Let's keep them anxious and running,
never knowing where we'll strike.

359
00:41:20,184 --> 00:41:23,654
That's a good point to consider.

360
00:41:24,755 --> 00:41:27,725
Shinza? You here?

361
00:41:27,925 --> 00:41:31,362
It's Hanbei kito of the Akashi clan.

362
00:41:37,401 --> 00:41:40,137
Shinza!

363
00:41:48,179 --> 00:41:50,648
Hanbei. I knew you'd come.

364
00:41:52,450 --> 00:41:54,752
Glad to see you.

365
00:41:56,921 --> 00:42:00,057
I thought you had left already.

366
00:42:01,092 --> 00:42:03,761
If we had time,
I'd enjoy a match of go.

367
00:42:03,961 --> 00:42:06,998
I still lead in wins.

368
00:42:07,198 --> 00:42:10,735
Leave our score aside
until we meet again.

369
00:42:10,935 --> 00:42:13,404
Again?

370
00:42:14,605 --> 00:42:18,776
For years I envied you: a man from
a good family, close to the Shogun...

371
00:42:18,976 --> 00:42:21,345
appointed to his elite guards.

372
00:42:21,546 --> 00:42:28,219
After you moved up,
I commanded the same post.

373
00:42:28,419 --> 00:42:34,625
To catch up,
I joined Lord Naritsugu.

374
00:42:34,825 --> 00:42:41,032
He earned a fortune
when he was adopted by the Akashi.

375
00:42:43,267 --> 00:42:47,572
That led me into this situation.

376
00:42:47,772 --> 00:42:51,409
What an ill twist of fate.

377
00:42:52,443 --> 00:42:56,747
Perhaps we both embraced fate.

378
00:42:56,948 --> 00:43:00,218
A samurai leads a helpless life.

379
00:43:00,418 --> 00:43:07,425
Mamiya should've committed harakiri
in front of his Lord.

380
00:43:08,626 --> 00:43:11,062
I once had that intention...

381
00:43:11,262 --> 00:43:19,170
but I could not betray his father,
the former Shogun.

382
00:43:21,005 --> 00:43:24,742
I lost my chance to move ahead.

383
00:43:24,942 --> 00:43:28,246
I regret not beating you.

384
00:43:28,446 --> 00:43:32,450
I was unable to commit harakiri.

385
00:43:35,119 --> 00:43:41,192
As a samurai, I'll do what must be done
for the people.

386
00:43:42,460 --> 00:43:45,263
For the people?

387
00:43:48,633 --> 00:43:55,206
A samurai must do but one thing.
Serve his master, correct?

388
00:44:04,582 --> 00:44:07,985
What an ill twist of fate.

389
00:44:09,353 --> 00:44:14,559
It's a long road to the Akashi domain.

390
00:44:14,759 --> 00:44:16,627
See you there.

391
00:44:16,827 --> 00:44:19,363
Bet on it.

392
00:44:47,355 --> 00:44:50,298
Edo

393
00:45:31,302 --> 00:45:36,440
Uncle, three days have passed
since Naritsugu left Edo.

394
00:45:37,642 --> 00:45:42,046
Where do we make our stand?

395
00:45:44,916 --> 00:45:48,252
How will Shinza make his move?

396
00:46:16,123 --> 00:46:18,436
We kept you waiting.

397
00:46:19,817 --> 00:46:25,489
The verdict is out.
Brothers, we take Lord Naritsugu at...

398
00:46:28,125 --> 00:46:32,697
Ochiai in the Mino province.

399
00:46:32,897 --> 00:46:34,966
Ochiai

400
00:46:36,167 --> 00:46:41,672
Naritsugu offended the Owari
by killing Makino's son in Kiso.

401
00:46:42,707 --> 00:46:48,546
We can enlist Makino's help at Kiso.

402
00:46:48,746 --> 00:46:52,283
Ask him to sign a non-transit act
using Lord Owari's name...

403
00:46:52,483 --> 00:46:55,653
to ban Naritsugu from passing.

404
00:46:55,887 --> 00:47:01,526
He'll join us due to the murder
of his son and daughter-in- law.

405
00:47:01,726 --> 00:47:02,994
And then?

406
00:47:03,194 --> 00:47:05,463
Only two possible routes.

407
00:47:05,663 --> 00:47:10,902
The kiso Pass or the Kamizaka Pass.

408
00:47:11,102 --> 00:47:15,840
Either way, he must pass via Ochiai.

409
00:47:16,040 --> 00:47:20,411
We'll fortify Ochiai and strike hard.

410
00:47:22,213 --> 00:47:27,752
What if they forgo appearances
and don't pay respect to the Naegi clan?

411
00:47:27,952 --> 00:47:32,924
There's a chance they may not stop.

412
00:47:33,124 --> 00:47:36,227
But I wager they will.

413
00:47:38,896 --> 00:47:41,999
With 12 men challenging
a bigger enemy...

414
00:47:43,201 --> 00:47:49,240
no matter how much we plan,
we must have faith in luck.

415
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:53,077
We pick here and risk it all.

416
00:47:54,445 --> 00:48:00,551
With heaven's will, the dice say Ochiai.

417
00:48:05,289 --> 00:48:06,691
Risk it all!

418
00:48:06,891 --> 00:48:11,796
Kuranaga, you're best suited
to get Makino's assistance.

419
00:48:11,996 --> 00:48:16,200
Leave it to me.
I'll get that road blocked.

420
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:18,369
- Take Ishizuka with you.
- I'm grateful.

421
00:48:18,569 --> 00:48:21,205
Let's get moving.

422
00:48:21,405 --> 00:48:22,874
Excuse us.

423
00:48:24,942 --> 00:48:26,811
Mitsuhashi, ready the horses.

424
00:48:27,011 --> 00:48:29,146
Ready and waiting, sir.

425
00:48:29,347 --> 00:48:35,553
Go on ahead and negotiate with
the Mayor of Ochiai.

426
00:48:37,288 --> 00:48:41,092
Give him these orders from Sir Doi.

427
00:48:41,292 --> 00:48:44,929
Understood. How should I proceed?

428
00:48:45,129 --> 00:48:47,565
Buy them all out.

429
00:48:48,599 --> 00:48:49,834
Yes, sir.

430
00:48:51,763 --> 00:48:53,247
Let's ride!

431
00:48:54,172 --> 00:48:57,942
Fast and hard to pass the enemy!

432
00:50:23,427 --> 00:50:25,530
You Shinzaemon Shimada?

433
00:50:26,564 --> 00:50:28,399
In the flesh.

434
00:50:28,599 --> 00:50:31,602
Are you Akashi henchmen?

435
00:51:30,361 --> 00:51:32,129
Don't follow them!

436
00:51:33,197 --> 00:51:34,932
Anyone hurt?

437
00:51:38,536 --> 00:51:42,807
That Hanbei, he drew first blood.

438
00:51:43,007 --> 00:51:46,711
Probably put coins in the hands
of these broke ronin.

439
00:51:46,878 --> 00:51:51,682
Not a real attack. His aim was
to break our strength.

440
00:51:59,290 --> 00:52:01,359
First time you killed as well?

441
00:52:01,559 --> 00:52:05,463
I've fenced with real blades
many times but...

442
00:52:05,663 --> 00:52:09,000
killing a man is a first.

443
00:52:15,473 --> 00:52:20,278
There's only one road,
but we don't know where they'll strike.

444
00:52:20,478 --> 00:52:24,382
If they attack harder next time,
we could get hurt.

445
00:52:26,384 --> 00:52:30,721
Let's accept Hanbei's welcome.

446
00:52:34,258 --> 00:52:39,197
And we'll vanish as well.

447
00:52:39,782 --> 00:52:40,902
Huh?

448
00:53:09,360 --> 00:53:13,164
Hioki's got some new friends!

449
00:53:15,766 --> 00:53:17,368
Disgusting!

450
00:53:43,561 --> 00:53:47,098
We'll travel northwest along the ridge,
and cut through the valley.

451
00:53:47,298 --> 00:53:51,536
Over the mountain to Owari territory.

452
00:53:52,670 --> 00:53:58,109
l had strict monastic training
when I was young in the mountains.

453
00:53:58,276 --> 00:54:04,949
The mountain brings blessings but
it's true nature is fear itself.

454
00:54:06,350 --> 00:54:07,752
I see.

455
00:54:16,961 --> 00:54:20,665
We are nobodies.

456
00:54:22,032 --> 00:54:23,167
Huh?

457
00:54:23,167 --> 00:54:29,240
He's right. No titles, no affiliations.
Nobodies.

458
00:55:07,678 --> 00:55:09,347
A buyout?

459
00:55:09,547 --> 00:55:11,716
That is our wish.

460
00:55:11,916 --> 00:55:16,454
I won't go against
Sir Doi's orders.

461
00:55:16,654 --> 00:55:22,894
But convincing the town will be hard.

462
00:55:32,581 --> 00:55:34,384
What?

463
00:55:34,872 --> 00:55:38,209
Our deposit. Not enough?

464
00:55:46,584 --> 00:55:49,120
The forest grows thicker.

465
00:55:50,188 --> 00:55:54,363
Hirayama, we're lost.

466
00:55:55,059 --> 00:55:57,628
Perhaps we should have detoured
at that cliff?

467
00:55:57,795 --> 00:55:59,997
- That can't be.
- But...

468
00:56:08,773 --> 00:56:12,016
Who are you?

469
00:56:12,016 --> 00:56:15,854
A bandit?
Or a raccoon goblin?

470
00:56:17,191 --> 00:56:19,169
Do I look like a raccoon?

471
00:56:21,864 --> 00:56:23,581
Ouch!

472
00:56:32,830 --> 00:56:35,600
Couldn't lower me down, idiot!?

473
00:56:35,800 --> 00:56:38,479
At least thank me.

474
00:56:40,104 --> 00:56:42,773
You from these parts?

475
00:56:44,609 --> 00:56:47,612
- Do I look so?
- Insolent!

476
00:57:01,626 --> 00:57:05,596
I ain't no ghost or bandit.

477
00:57:07,465 --> 00:57:10,468
l hunt beasts from mountain
to mountain.

478
00:57:10,668 --> 00:57:12,436
Any men with you?

479
00:57:13,771 --> 00:57:17,308
Gone. 'Cause I laid my hands on Upashi.

480
00:57:17,508 --> 00:57:19,443
Upashi?

481
00:57:21,312 --> 00:57:23,281
The boss's woman.

482
00:57:25,049 --> 00:57:28,986
So he punished you. Fools are the same
wherever you go.

483
00:57:30,021 --> 00:57:31,689
Hold your tongue!

484
00:57:31,889 --> 00:57:34,091
Got a name, son?

485
00:57:36,360 --> 00:57:37,662
Koyata Kiga.

486
00:57:37,862 --> 00:57:41,632
My ancestors were defeated warriors,
legitimate samurai stock.

487
00:57:45,703 --> 00:57:47,438
What's so funny?

488
00:57:47,638 --> 00:57:52,043
The name's Shinzaemon.
And these are my men.

489
00:57:54,745 --> 00:57:56,848
What are samurai doing out here?

490
00:57:58,149 --> 00:58:01,619
A shortcut made us lose our way.

491
00:58:05,656 --> 00:58:09,961
I'll be your guide,
if you got  food.

492
00:58:11,729 --> 00:58:13,364
Deal?

493
00:58:15,066 --> 00:58:16,278
Deal?

494
00:58:30,114 --> 00:58:31,649
What's that?

495
00:58:32,683 --> 00:58:36,451
Don't like bugs?
Watch...

496
00:58:40,424 --> 00:58:43,319
Don't be a little girl!

497
00:58:43,569 --> 00:58:45,485
What?

498
00:58:53,037 --> 00:58:55,173
Let's go.

499
00:58:58,776 --> 00:59:00,745
What now?

500
00:59:33,678 --> 00:59:35,930
Leave the rabbit.

501
00:59:36,514 --> 00:59:38,749
We have important work to do.

502
00:59:39,984 --> 00:59:41,586
More important than roast rabbit?

503
00:59:46,257 --> 00:59:48,125
Sir Hanbei!

504
00:59:48,326 --> 00:59:50,141
What is it?

505
00:59:50,310 --> 00:59:51,338
Emergency.

506
00:59:51,513 --> 00:59:54,027
Lord Naritsugu's passage is banned.

507
00:59:54,196 --> 00:59:56,523
His passage is banned?

508
01:00:03,007 --> 01:00:04,942
What's the matter?

509
01:00:12,683 --> 01:00:18,456
You fools, will you stand idly by
at this humiliation?

510
01:00:29,800 --> 01:00:32,870
Lord Owari is from the top three clans.

511
01:00:33,104 --> 01:00:37,241
But I am the son of the former Shogun,

512
01:00:37,241 --> 01:00:41,212
and brother to the current Shogun.

513
01:00:41,245 --> 01:00:42,747
Cross over!

514
01:00:42,947 --> 01:00:44,415
Watch and learn.

515
01:00:44,549 --> 01:00:49,935
We must go through Owari land.
Can our Lord swallow his pride?

516
01:00:50,263 --> 01:00:54,434
Let's see if he gets his way
as he usually does.

517
01:00:59,219 --> 01:01:01,039
Who are you?

518
01:01:02,200 --> 01:01:04,202
Identify yourself.

519
01:01:08,105 --> 01:01:09,841
Out of my way...

520
01:01:11,008 --> 01:01:13,578
or I'll kill you without mercy.

521
01:01:14,912 --> 01:01:16,914
Last April...

522
01:01:17,048 --> 01:01:20,084
in Kiso, you killed my son...

523
01:01:21,118 --> 01:01:26,789
Uneme Makino and his wife.
I am Yukie Makino.

524
01:01:29,916 --> 01:01:32,886
Does daddy monkey have hard bones too?

525
01:01:35,171 --> 01:01:36,848
My Lord!

526
01:01:42,618 --> 01:01:44,290
Hanbei?

527
01:01:44,484 --> 01:01:45,522
Leave this.

528
01:01:45,722 --> 01:01:49,229
Let's go back

529
01:01:58,556 --> 01:02:02,360
Owari only banned Lord Naritsugu.

530
01:02:02,560 --> 01:02:07,698
His entourage can enter.
They are Akashi members.

531
01:02:08,369 --> 01:02:10,251
I see.

532
01:02:10,458 --> 01:02:12,513
The rest will guard our Lord.

533
01:02:12,681 --> 01:02:16,404
If people hear Owari blocked us...

534
01:02:16,591 --> 01:02:20,798
If we don't visit the Naegi,
our Lord will be ridiculed.

535
01:02:21,006 --> 01:02:23,314
Let them laugh.

536
01:02:23,505 --> 01:02:27,008
Within a year,
our lord will be second-in-command.

537
01:02:27,585 --> 01:02:34,091
You risk his life and the Akashi clan by
visiting the Naegi.

538
01:02:35,359 --> 01:02:39,430
You seem most afraid of Shinzaemon.

539
01:02:39,630 --> 01:02:43,612
What can a weak Shogun servant do?

540
01:02:43,991 --> 01:02:48,268
Since paying off the ronin,
there's no sign of him.

541
01:02:48,627 --> 01:02:52,142
Perhaps he fears our clan and ran?

542
01:02:52,366 --> 01:02:56,927
Don't you see? He's the one who
blocked our passage.

543
01:03:02,053 --> 01:03:08,359
Do you cling to your life so as to
make me a laughing stock?

544
01:03:08,526 --> 01:03:12,400
Desperate times call for
desperate measures.

545
01:03:12,767 --> 01:03:19,907
l hear any samurai would chose death
over making his Lord a laughing stock.

546
01:03:30,181 --> 01:03:33,017
Choose the foolish path.

547
01:03:36,053 --> 01:03:38,547
It's more fun that way.

548
01:03:42,894 --> 01:03:45,572
Let's go, Hanbei.

549
01:03:46,163 --> 01:03:48,080
Move out!

550
01:05:00,338 --> 01:05:02,540
We've had enough.

551
01:05:17,955 --> 01:05:20,625
Oh, the road.

552
01:05:26,864 --> 01:05:29,282
The road!

553
01:05:41,445 --> 01:05:42,647
Welcome. Been expecting you.

554
01:05:42,847 --> 01:05:43,848
You've prepared well.

555
01:05:44,048 --> 01:05:45,883
Progress couldn't be better.

556
01:05:46,050 --> 01:05:48,352
Did it work?

557
01:05:48,452 --> 01:05:55,063
Makino stopped them perfectly.
Naritsugu diverted his troops.

558
01:05:55,313 --> 01:05:56,209
Well, well.

559
01:05:56,421 --> 01:05:58,192
Our long shot paid off.

560
01:05:58,629 --> 01:06:00,376
How many men with Naritsugu?

561
01:06:00,582 --> 01:06:02,187
Seventy men.

562
01:06:02,612 --> 01:06:04,696
And Makino?

563
01:06:04,903 --> 01:06:11,139
He left nothing to chance.
He chose the path of harakiri.

564
01:06:12,263 --> 01:06:17,102
He took full blame,
left no evidence behind.

565
01:06:18,284 --> 01:06:20,413
He's a mighty samurai.

566
01:06:22,954 --> 01:06:27,225
We must achieve our mission for him.

567
01:06:29,277 --> 01:06:31,318
Hey!

568
01:06:35,266 --> 01:06:37,299
Got dinner!

569
01:06:37,661 --> 01:06:39,529
Who is he?

570
01:06:40,963 --> 01:06:43,732
He dropped in when we entered
the forest.

571
01:06:43,918 --> 01:06:45,653
Dropped in?

572
01:06:48,212 --> 01:06:52,743
Set a trap here using
this rock wall.

573
01:06:59,223 --> 01:07:02,159
This alley is a hard nut to crack.

574
01:07:06,214 --> 01:07:09,185
Shinrokuro, what do you see?

575
01:07:09,379 --> 01:07:11,620
Looks like an ordinary boarding town.

576
01:07:11,812 --> 01:07:13,282
It is

577
01:07:13,357 --> 01:07:18,531
So we'll transform it into
a town of death.

578
01:07:18,821 --> 01:07:22,331
Mitsuhashi,
get busy with the preparations.

579
01:07:22,405 --> 01:07:25,755
Send Ishizuka to keep watch.

580
01:07:40,431 --> 01:07:41,879
Upashi.

581
01:07:51,943 --> 01:07:53,511
Miss home?

582
01:07:56,147 --> 01:07:58,282
I miss Upashi.

583
01:07:59,817 --> 01:08:01,252
Is she that fine?

584
01:08:04,061 --> 01:08:09,414
Like no woman you've ever seen.

585
01:08:11,295 --> 01:08:17,668
Soon, this quiet town will become
a bloodbath.

586
01:08:18,282 --> 01:08:20,574
Go home alive while you can.

587
01:08:22,940 --> 01:08:24,742
I got no home.

588
01:08:24,942 --> 01:08:28,746
This is our fight.
You're not a samurai.

589
01:08:32,517 --> 01:08:36,546
Don't trifle with your life.
Got it?

590
01:08:39,624 --> 01:08:41,592
Damn samurai!

591
01:08:42,627 --> 01:08:47,665
You and your honor and causes!

592
01:08:49,967 --> 01:08:52,170
I'll show you!

593
01:08:59,897 --> 01:09:00,732
Vanished?

594
01:09:00,932 --> 01:09:04,796
Lord Naritsugu passed through
Komagane along the Ina road.

595
01:09:04,971 --> 01:09:09,242
Then he vanished.

596
01:09:09,423 --> 01:09:11,775
Back to Edo?

597
01:09:12,127 --> 01:09:14,695
Not possible with Naritsugu in control.

598
01:09:15,063 --> 01:09:20,026
I'm concerned he'll cut through
to the Sanshu road and skip lida.

599
01:09:20,214 --> 01:09:23,348
Without visiting the Naegi clan?

600
01:09:24,902 --> 01:09:26,137
Stand down.

601
01:09:27,138 --> 01:09:29,407
Now, the playing field is level.

602
01:09:29,607 --> 01:09:33,845
Hanbei is trying to ascertain
our next move.

603
01:09:35,613 --> 01:09:38,683
We wait here. Prepare for battle.

604
01:09:44,622 --> 01:09:46,591
Batten down that side.

605
01:10:00,471 --> 01:10:02,173
Yes! Put it there.

606
01:10:28,666 --> 01:10:33,905
If they don't show today,
they must have gone to Okazaki.

607
01:10:34,071 --> 01:10:36,707
Another route?

608
01:10:36,908 --> 01:10:40,244
Waiting is killing our chances.

609
01:10:40,444 --> 01:10:43,748
Let's abandon Ochiai tonight.

610
01:10:43,948 --> 01:10:47,919
We can cross the pass
to the Sanshu Road.

611
01:10:49,387 --> 01:10:52,841
Shinzaemon, it's time to decide!

612
01:10:53,213 --> 01:10:54,149
Too soon.

613
01:10:54,337 --> 01:10:56,070
But...

614
01:10:57,106 --> 01:11:01,307
Do you know the secret to fishing?

615
01:11:04,368 --> 01:11:07,966
Wait until the fish swallows the hook.

616
01:11:08,334 --> 01:11:10,439
Reel it when it swallows.
It's simple.

617
01:11:10,814 --> 01:11:19,012
But if you reel in too soon,
the fish will escape with the bait.

618
01:11:20,516 --> 01:11:25,021
So you say the Akashi are close?

619
01:11:26,376 --> 01:11:30,906
With Hanbei at Naritsugu's side,
there is a chance...

620
01:11:31,296 --> 01:11:33,371
They might skip the Naegi.

621
01:11:33,558 --> 01:11:36,231
Their numbers are not like ours.

622
01:11:36,425 --> 01:11:39,194
Even if they went off the road...

623
01:11:39,374 --> 01:11:45,960
seventy men cannot travel
without being noticed.

624
01:11:47,981 --> 01:11:53,876
They must be in one place,
awaiting our next move.

625
01:11:54,050 --> 01:11:56,824
And if this is so?

626
01:11:57,004 --> 01:12:01,031
They'll come if they think its safe.

627
01:12:02,555 --> 01:12:06,449
We wait until the fish swallows
the hook.

628
01:12:22,285 --> 01:12:23,517
They're here!

629
01:12:24,384 --> 01:12:25,878
They're here!

630
01:12:26,065 --> 01:12:27,967
They're coming!

631
01:12:28,919 --> 01:12:30,531
The Akashi men are coming!

632
01:12:30,722 --> 01:12:31,786
From where?

633
01:12:33,493 --> 01:12:37,818
Along the Ohira road.
But there are not 70.

634
01:12:38,008 --> 01:12:38,920
What?

635
01:12:41,506 --> 01:12:45,146
Many more. Over 200!

636
01:12:45,506 --> 01:12:46,652
Two hundred?

637
01:13:04,677 --> 01:13:11,476
Hanbei! He bought time and summoned
troops from other areas!

638
01:13:11,834 --> 01:13:14,938
Twelve men can never defeat 200.

639
01:13:17,323 --> 01:13:22,889
So what! As for the fish that takes
the hook... the bigger, the better.
.

640
01:13:30,073 --> 01:13:33,438
Heavens will brought us all together.

641
01:13:41,725 --> 01:13:43,448
Thirteen.

642
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:53,915
The time has come to lay down
your lives for the greater cause.

643
01:13:56,008 --> 01:13:57,354
Are you ready?

644
01:13:58,622 --> 01:14:00,392
Ready to die?

645
01:14:01,119 --> 01:14:02,244
Yes!

646
01:14:57,406 --> 01:15:01,539
Take your posts!

647
01:15:23,207 --> 01:15:25,243
Halt!

648
01:15:27,899 --> 01:15:29,851
Asakawa, wait here.

649
01:15:30,287 --> 01:15:32,089
Let me through.

650
01:16:08,001 --> 01:16:09,536
Move out!

651
01:16:58,523 --> 01:17:00,491
How much longer to Nakatsugawa?

652
01:17:03,227 --> 01:17:05,096
Tell me how far!

653
01:17:16,974 --> 01:17:18,809
What's the matter?

654
01:17:19,043 --> 01:17:20,311
Oh no!

655
01:17:20,511 --> 01:17:23,047
My Lord!

656
01:17:28,185 --> 01:17:30,578
Turn back! My Lord!

657
01:18:08,526 --> 01:18:11,774
What fun.
I'm going in, Hanbei!

658
01:18:13,898 --> 01:18:16,601
My Lord! Follow him!

659
01:18:21,239 --> 01:18:22,807
Hey!

660
01:18:25,243 --> 01:18:27,278
You can get past this way.

661
01:18:28,913 --> 01:18:31,465
This way, this way.

662
01:19:32,476 --> 01:19:34,111
Shinzaemon.

663
01:19:34,621 --> 01:19:40,764
I presume you are the Akashi entourage
of Lord Naritsugu.

664
01:19:43,054 --> 01:19:47,935
By the order of His Shogun's subject
Shinzaemon...

665
01:19:48,358 --> 01:19:52,307
we commemorate your passage
with arrows!

666
01:19:54,465 --> 01:19:55,466
My Lord!

667
01:19:58,836 --> 01:20:00,037
My Lord!

668
01:20:02,585 --> 01:20:04,673
Leave the horses. Protect our Lord.

669
01:21:05,636 --> 01:21:07,091
My Lord.

670
01:21:17,938 --> 01:21:19,854
Come this way.

671
01:21:21,048 --> 01:21:22,378
Please wait.

672
01:21:22,647 --> 01:21:24,234
Secure the interior.

673
01:21:25,418 --> 01:21:27,219
Secure the interior.

674
01:21:27,420 --> 01:21:29,697
Hey, secure the interior.

675
01:22:18,429 --> 01:22:21,037
Enough petty tricks

676
01:22:27,049 --> 01:22:30,630
Only 130 left!

677
01:22:30,836 --> 01:22:34,120
What you paid for my life...

678
01:22:34,495 --> 01:22:36,655
was a real bargain.

679
01:22:38,429 --> 01:22:42,075
The enemy is not large! Don't panic.

680
01:22:42,436 --> 01:22:45,393
Show them the spirit of Akashi samurai!

681
01:22:45,568 --> 01:22:50,894
Trade your lives to protect our Lord.

682
01:23:08,926 --> 01:23:10,445
My Lord!

683
01:23:12,141 --> 01:23:13,112
Lord!

684
01:23:21,872 --> 01:23:28,090
TOTAL MASSACRE

685
01:23:43,809 --> 01:23:47,441
Kill! Kill them all!

686
01:26:12,792 --> 01:26:14,040
Ogura!

687
01:26:33,680 --> 01:26:36,252
Fire? No, no!

688
01:27:15,161 --> 01:27:17,385
My Lord! I found a way out!

689
01:27:25,890 --> 01:27:28,349
No! It's a trap.

690
01:27:32,164 --> 01:27:33,233
My Lord.

691
01:27:40,791 --> 01:27:42,401
Come!

692
01:28:14,070 --> 01:28:15,309
Hioki!

693
01:28:25,380 --> 01:28:27,111
Go, go!

694
01:28:27,291 --> 01:28:28,621
This way, my Lord.

695
01:29:05,814 --> 01:29:06,953
Look.

696
01:29:32,691 --> 01:29:38,264
Ogura, kill the men that get past me.

697
01:29:38,308 --> 01:29:40,838
Don't leave one alive.

698
01:29:41,070 --> 01:29:42,665
Yes, master

699
01:29:47,301 --> 01:29:48,769
Kill!

700
01:30:55,443 --> 01:30:56,976
Retreat.

701
01:31:01,123 --> 01:31:02,368
Ogura!

702
01:31:38,599 --> 01:31:41,038
Your samurai brawls are crazy fun.

703
01:31:41,248 --> 01:31:43,562
It's no brawl!

704
01:31:46,566 --> 01:31:48,603
Why are you samurai so arrogant?

705
01:31:51,949 --> 01:31:54,084
Why are you samurai...

706
01:31:54,314 --> 01:31:58,418
so arrogant?

707
01:32:09,120 --> 01:32:11,806
Higuchi, you okay?

708
01:32:13,537 --> 01:32:15,172
Thanks.

709
01:32:36,905 --> 01:32:39,134
Hioki!

710
01:33:17,654 --> 01:33:19,219
Hioki...

711
01:33:20,987 --> 01:33:25,448
You fought well. A true samurai.

712
01:33:29,050 --> 01:33:30,273
Shinzaemon.

713
01:33:33,748 --> 01:33:35,528
Higuchi!

714
01:34:03,043 --> 01:34:05,747
- Go!
- Finish the job.

715
01:34:06,711 --> 01:34:08,351
Ishizuka!

716
01:34:17,854 --> 01:34:20,113
Ishizuka!

717
01:34:27,464 --> 01:34:29,076
Otake...

718
01:34:30,996 --> 01:34:34,832
Our mission...

719
01:34:35,154 --> 01:34:39,068
finish it!

720
01:34:45,787 --> 01:34:47,255
Shinzaemon!

721
01:35:31,255 --> 01:35:32,672
Mitsuhashi!

722
01:35:43,796 --> 01:35:45,632
Damn!

723
01:35:52,277 --> 01:35:53,878
Mitsuhashi!

724
01:36:54,448 --> 01:36:56,316
You fool!

725
01:37:00,581 --> 01:37:03,566
Hanbei...

726
01:37:03,645 --> 01:37:06,715
You think the age of war was like this?

727
01:37:07,720 --> 01:37:09,588
Perhaps.

728
01:37:11,239 --> 01:37:13,565
It's magnificent.

729
01:37:16,633 --> 01:37:21,064
With death comes gratitude for life.

730
01:37:21,321 --> 01:37:26,245
If a man has lived in vain,
then how trivial his life is.

731
01:37:29,291 --> 01:37:32,573
Oh, Hanbei.

732
01:37:32,754 --> 01:37:35,662
Something wonderful has come to
my mind.

733
01:37:37,007 --> 01:37:40,428
Once I'm on the Shogun's council,

734
01:37:40,497 --> 01:37:43,965
let's bring back the age of war.

735
01:38:31,658 --> 01:38:36,132
I'm Saheita Kuranaga.

736
01:38:36,334 --> 01:38:38,502
Lord Naritsugu...

737
01:38:38,563 --> 01:38:41,706
I've come for your life.

738
01:38:44,122 --> 01:38:45,553
Sir Hanbei...

739
01:38:46,949 --> 01:38:51,420
protect our Lord.

740
01:39:21,842 --> 01:39:24,086
Kuranaga!

741
01:40:13,902 --> 01:40:15,303
My Lord!

742
01:42:04,579 --> 01:42:09,150
Master...

743
01:42:40,253 --> 01:42:42,922
Who are you?

744
01:42:45,200 --> 01:42:47,219
You're no samurai!

745
01:42:47,445 --> 01:42:49,747
So what?

746
01:42:55,961 --> 01:42:58,197
Do only samurai matter in this world?

747
01:43:04,438 --> 01:43:07,747
I thought samurai would be fun...

748
01:43:08,571 --> 01:43:10,540
but you bore me.

749
01:43:11,458 --> 01:43:17,422
You're useless.
Even more useless in great numbers.

750
01:43:37,817 --> 01:43:40,292
This man speaks the truth.

751
01:43:40,460 --> 01:43:44,017
His reward is my short sword.

752
01:43:45,050 --> 01:43:48,085
If we can get past that...

753
01:43:49,056 --> 01:43:52,975
Remain focused. Victory is ours!

754
01:43:53,207 --> 01:43:56,343
Keep our Lord safe. We'll win!

755
01:44:43,118 --> 01:44:44,286
My Lord!

756
01:44:45,560 --> 01:44:47,729
Let's run.

757
01:44:49,168 --> 01:44:53,550
Hanbei, victory is not yet ours.

758
01:45:08,445 --> 01:45:10,480
Shinza.

759
01:45:18,368 --> 01:45:22,029
Hanbei, I have no qualms with you.

760
01:45:24,165 --> 01:45:26,102
You will not pass.

761
01:45:27,084 --> 01:45:31,162
I'll trade my life to protect my Lord.

762
01:45:32,886 --> 01:45:35,322
I must do what must be done.

763
01:45:36,609 --> 01:45:41,283
Are you so hungry for my Lord's life?

764
01:45:41,464 --> 01:45:43,600
Yes!

765
01:45:44,675 --> 01:45:51,836
I gambled my life in this senseless war
of power and politics.

766
01:45:53,538 --> 01:45:56,453
If he joins the Shogun's council...

767
01:45:56,548 --> 01:46:02,837
you know disaster will befall
the people!

768
01:46:03,011 --> 01:46:04,048
Am I wrong?

769
01:46:04,255 --> 01:46:05,922
So what then?

770
01:46:06,865 --> 01:46:10,824
Both you and I were born samurai.

771
01:46:11,014 --> 01:46:12,869
Ours is not to wonder why.

772
01:46:12,985 --> 01:46:15,269
Ours is...

773
01:46:15,438 --> 01:46:18,708
to obey our fate and die.

774
01:46:20,461 --> 01:46:22,996
If you were my ally...

775
01:46:23,167 --> 01:46:27,885
if you were not an Akashi retainer...

776
01:46:29,076 --> 01:46:31,078
wouldn't our task be easier?

777
01:46:31,146 --> 01:46:33,571
Don't lecture me!

778
01:46:33,732 --> 01:46:38,314
No matter how low I go,
Hanbei Kito is a samurai!

779
01:46:38,507 --> 01:46:42,502
I won't hand over my Lord's head
so easily.

780
01:46:50,153 --> 01:46:51,955
Shinza...

781
01:46:53,593 --> 01:46:57,293
to pass, you'll have to kill me.

782
01:47:03,981 --> 01:47:06,850
That I shall do.

783
01:47:07,773 --> 01:47:09,508
Fight!

784
01:47:20,526 --> 01:47:23,774
Such elegance in fighting one-on-one.

785
01:48:07,398 --> 01:48:10,628
How I missed crossing swords with you!

786
01:48:16,648 --> 01:48:18,234
Hanbei...

787
01:48:19,309 --> 01:48:23,375
in the dojo, we were an even match.

788
01:48:37,474 --> 01:48:38,875
Hanbei...

789
01:48:41,280 --> 01:48:43,449
see you in hell!

790
01:49:18,139 --> 01:49:20,300
Some call it elegance

791
01:49:20,485 --> 01:49:24,939
Some call it
cruel and unfair.

792
01:49:25,120 --> 01:49:27,604
I like it.

793
01:49:56,901 --> 01:50:01,632
How can you kick his head?

794
01:50:01,826 --> 01:50:03,961
He gave his life for you!

795
01:50:05,918 --> 01:50:08,888
Kick my head if you want.

796
01:50:17,441 --> 01:50:23,417
For the Shogun, for the people,
for the many who died untimely deaths...

797
01:50:23,632 --> 01:50:25,888
for Uneme Makino and his wife...

798
01:50:25,968 --> 01:50:30,233
for his father Yukie Makino...

799
01:50:30,402 --> 01:50:35,209
and for my men scattering Ochiai.

800
01:50:35,383 --> 01:50:37,364
For that...

801
01:50:39,022 --> 01:50:43,024
innocent, nameless young girl...

802
01:50:43,260 --> 01:50:46,294
with severed arms and legs...

803
01:50:48,106 --> 01:50:51,094
I shall take your life!

804
01:50:52,697 --> 01:50:54,084
Ruling is convenient...

805
01:50:54,239 --> 01:50:58,127
but only for rulers.

806
01:50:59,275 --> 01:51:02,409
The people must live to serve.

807
01:51:04,598 --> 01:51:10,847
Even so, a time comes when servants
rise up against their lords.

808
01:51:14,017 --> 01:51:18,000
You're on top
thanks to support from the bottom.

809
01:51:18,226 --> 01:51:19,980
Don't you see?

810
01:51:28,516 --> 01:51:32,463
Your mistake is believing that

811
01:51:32,644 --> 01:51:36,096
your decorative blade is not
just for show.

812
01:51:37,244 --> 01:51:40,923
Nonsense. It's not for show!

813
01:51:41,112 --> 01:51:45,720
Decoration is for show.

814
01:51:45,889 --> 01:51:50,490
Be silent like the decorative man
you are.

815
01:51:52,569 --> 01:51:54,641
Servant!

816
01:51:59,276 --> 01:52:01,812
How is this for show?

817
01:52:27,612 --> 01:52:29,314
Uncle!

818
01:52:34,955 --> 01:52:36,056
Pain.

819
01:52:48,026 --> 01:52:50,395
It hurts!

820
01:52:53,978 --> 01:52:55,980
That's unexpected.

821
01:52:57,095 --> 01:52:59,460
Can you feel pain?

822
01:53:01,762 --> 01:53:04,732
Am I dying?

823
01:53:06,251 --> 01:53:08,680
Dying?

824
01:53:14,108 --> 01:53:18,342
I'm scared. So scared.

825
01:53:18,537 --> 01:53:19,538
Scared.

826
01:53:25,329 --> 01:53:27,667
I don't want...

827
01:53:29,625 --> 01:53:31,593
to die.

828
01:53:36,557 --> 01:53:38,116
I'm scared.

829
01:53:52,951 --> 01:53:55,406
My Lord...

830
01:53:55,578 --> 01:53:58,204
prepare yourself!

831
01:54:01,886 --> 01:54:07,027
So death comes for us all.

832
01:54:13,136 --> 01:54:19,020
Allow me to thank you, Shinzaemon.

833
01:54:28,282 --> 01:54:31,852
Of all the days of my life,

834
01:54:32,037 --> 01:54:35,919
today has been the most exciting.

835
01:54:39,083 --> 01:54:40,762
You're welcome!

836
01:54:52,240 --> 01:54:54,054
It's over.

837
01:54:59,398 --> 01:55:01,811
The big gamble paid off.

838
01:55:09,525 --> 01:55:11,661
Shinrokuro...

839
01:55:13,696 --> 01:55:16,266
being a samurai...

840
01:55:17,737 --> 01:55:22,627
is truly a burden.

841
01:55:28,356 --> 01:55:31,408
Do what you want...

842
01:55:32,798 --> 01:55:35,204
with your life.

843
01:57:12,684 --> 01:57:14,877
Are you immortal?

844
01:57:16,403 --> 01:57:19,156
You got the Lord's head without me?

845
01:57:21,256 --> 01:57:23,343
Our fight is over.

846
01:57:25,159 --> 01:57:27,307
That ain't no fun.

847
01:57:29,391 --> 01:57:31,492
You hurt?

848
01:57:33,366 --> 01:57:38,889
Compared to fighting a wild bear,
these wounds are nothing.

849
01:57:42,581 --> 01:57:44,879
All in all...

850
01:57:46,122 --> 01:57:48,457
I want my Upashi.

851
01:57:53,200 --> 01:57:56,367
I don't like towns swarming
with samurai.

852
01:57:57,487 --> 01:58:01,542
I'll go home,
sweep Upashi off her feet...

853
01:58:01,724 --> 01:58:04,253
and live far away!

854
01:58:05,571 --> 01:58:07,757
Live your life.

855
01:58:10,603 --> 01:58:12,738
'Til the next life!

856
01:58:19,285 --> 01:58:21,254
What are you going to do?

857
01:58:24,413 --> 01:58:28,360
Whatever I want.
Been a samurai long enough.

858
01:58:29,977 --> 01:58:32,758
Become a bandit.

859
01:58:33,031 --> 01:58:38,823
The greatest bandit in Japan. Jump ship
to America, make love to women.

860
01:58:38,997 --> 01:58:42,621
Now you're talking.

861
01:58:44,755 --> 01:58:47,009
Say ''hi'' to Upashi for me.

862
01:58:51,765 --> 01:58:53,733
Sure.

In May 1844,

865
02:00:41,866 --> 02:00:46,798
it was reported to
the Central Government...

866
02:00:46,984 --> 02:00:50,769
that Lord Naritsugu
fell ill and died.

867
02:00:52,241 --> 02:00:54,357
Some 23 years later,

868
02:00:54,466 --> 02:00:56,941
the Shogunate system was abolished.

869
02:00:57,078 --> 02:00:59,559
