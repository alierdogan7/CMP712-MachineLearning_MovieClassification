[ Sarah ] lf the people we love
are stolen from us...

1032
01:33:54,680 --> 01:33:59,777
the way to have them live on
is to never stop loving them.

1033
01:33:59,851 --> 01:34:05,756
Buildings burn, people die,
but real love is forever.

1048
01:35:25,530 --> 01:35:29,125

* And telling me to still believe *

1083
01:38:12,997 --> 01:38:15,932
* Within the emptiness
of the burning cities *

1084
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:18,434
* Against which we save
our darkest selves *

1085
01:38:18,502 --> 01:38:21,096
* Until l felt safe *

1086
01:38:21,172 --> 01:38:23,265
* And warm *

01:38:23,341 --> 01:38:26,606

01:38:26,677 --> 01:38:28,941
* And when l awoke *

1089
01:38:29,013 --> 01:38:31,277

from just what we are *

1106

* Smoke a cigarette
and lie some more *

1107

* Her dizzy head
is conscience laden *

1115
01:40:53,457 --> 01:40:58,554
* Time to wait too long
to wait too long *

1116
01:40:58,629 --> 01:41:02,395
* Way too long **
