1
00:01:22,613 --> 00:01:24,205
My life fades...

2
00:01:25,453 --> 00:01:27,171
...the vision dims.

3
00:01:27,853 --> 00:01:30,083
All that remains are memories.

4
00:01:31,693 --> 00:01:33,968
I remember...a time of chaos...

5
00:01:36,213 --> 00:01:38,727
...ruined dreams...this wasted land.

6
00:01:40,653 --> 00:01:43,690
But most of all,
I remember the Road Warrior...

7
00:01:45,453 --> 00:01:47,444
...the man we called Max.

8
00:01:48,533 --> 00:01:52,367
To understand who he was,
you have to go back to another time...

9
00:01:53,133 --> 00:01:56,170
...when the world was powered
by the black fuel...

10
00:01:56,373 --> 00:02:00,048
...and the deserts sprouted great cities
ofpipe and steel.

11
00:02:02,813 --> 00:02:04,644
Gone now...swept away.

12
00:02:06,093 --> 00:02:10,245
For reasons long forgotten,
two mighty warrior tribes went to war...

13
00:02:10,813 --> 00:02:14,089
...and touched off a blaze
which engulfed them all.

14
00:02:14,613 --> 00:02:18,447
Without fuel they were nothing.
They'd built a house of straw.

15
00:02:19,053 --> 00:02:22,045
The thundering machines sputtered
and stopped.

16
00:02:24,973 --> 00:02:28,170
Their leaders talked...and talked...
and talked...

17
00:02:32,373 --> 00:02:35,126
...but nothing could stem the avalanche.

18
00:02:36,413 --> 00:02:39,291
Their world crumbled...
the cities exploded.

19
00:02:41,613 --> 00:02:43,604
A whirlwind of looting...

20
00:02:44,253 --> 00:02:46,164
...a firestorm of fear.

21
00:02:47,333 --> 00:02:49,324
Men began to feed on men.

22
00:02:51,693 --> 00:02:54,571
On the roads it was a white-line nightmare.

23
00:02:55,613 --> 00:02:58,173
Only those mobile enough to scavenge...

24
00:02:58,413 --> 00:03:01,246
...brutal enough to pillage would survive.

25
00:03:01,933 --> 00:03:04,401
The gangs took over the highways...

26
00:03:05,093 --> 00:03:07,891
...ready to wage war for a tank ofjuice.

27
00:03:09,613 --> 00:03:12,002
And in this maelstrom of decay...

28
00:03:12,813 --> 00:03:15,611
...ordinary men were battered
and smashed.

29
00:03:16,053 --> 00:03:17,566
Men like Max...

30
00:03:18,253 --> 00:03:19,971
...the warrior Max.

31
00:03:22,773 --> 00:03:25,810
In the roar of an engine,
he lost everything...

32
00:03:31,053 --> 00:03:33,328
...and became a shell of a man...

33
00:03:33,573 --> 00:03:35,848
...a burnt out, desolate man...

34
00:03:36,613 --> 00:03:39,446
...a man haunted by the demons
of his past.

35
00:03:41,533 --> 00:03:44,331
A man who wandered out
into the wasteland.

36
00:03:46,533 --> 00:03:49,411
And it was here...in this blighted place...

37
00:03:53,013 --> 00:03:55,402
...that he learned to live again.

38
00:10:03,213 --> 00:10:05,681
Don't hurt the snake! Put it down...

39
00:10:06,333 --> 00:10:08,324
...gently, gently...nice.

40
00:10:09,693 --> 00:10:11,126
Now the iron.

41
00:10:14,093 --> 00:10:15,321
The gun.

42
00:10:16,493 --> 00:10:18,484
Down, down. Turn around.

43
00:10:31,773 --> 00:10:34,731
Looks like I've got myself
some gasoline, eh?

44
00:10:35,333 --> 00:10:36,561
V8? Eh?

45
00:10:37,213 --> 00:10:40,011
Booby-trapped.
Touch those tanks and boom!

46
00:10:48,293 --> 00:10:50,090
Booby-trap! Back up!

47
00:10:52,533 --> 00:10:54,808
Oh, you crafty little man, you!

48
00:10:55,533 --> 00:10:57,569
You're quick...very quick.

49
00:10:59,733 --> 00:11:03,043
Never seen a man beat the snake before.
Who are you?

50
00:11:05,653 --> 00:11:08,087
Reflexes...that's what you've got.

51
00:11:10,733 --> 00:11:12,530
Me...l've got brains.

52
00:11:19,653 --> 00:11:21,689
A fella...a quick fella...

53
00:11:22,733 --> 00:11:26,851
...might have a weapon under there.
I'd have to pin his head to the panel.

54
00:11:43,893 --> 00:11:45,804
Don't play me the fool!

55
00:11:52,133 --> 00:11:55,330
Gas! Guel! Gasoline!
Thousands of gallons of it!

56
00:11:55,693 --> 00:11:57,524
-As much as you want!
-Where? Where?

57
00:11:57,613 --> 00:12:00,810
20 miles from here!
Pumping it, they are! Refining!

58
00:12:02,213 --> 00:12:04,249
-A huge tanker full.
-Crap!

59
00:12:04,733 --> 00:12:06,212
No, it's true!

60
00:12:06,573 --> 00:12:09,770
It's not self-service, no.
It's too hard for me...

61
00:12:10,093 --> 00:12:12,129
...but a man of your ingenuity--

62
00:12:12,213 --> 00:12:13,123
Where?

63
00:12:13,933 --> 00:12:16,367
Kill me and you'll never find out!

64
00:12:35,413 --> 00:12:36,687
Good dog.

65
00:12:37,333 --> 00:12:38,527
Nice doggy, eh?

66
00:13:10,853 --> 00:13:12,525
Well, there it is.

67
00:13:17,173 --> 00:13:19,129
Four days I was up here.

68
00:13:19,573 --> 00:13:22,883
Me and the snakes...
playing mah-jong, taking tea...

69
00:13:24,413 --> 00:13:26,369
...watching, thinking...

70
00:13:27,253 --> 00:13:30,211
...how was I going to get in
and get the gas?

71
00:13:31,733 --> 00:13:33,803
Day and night it's pumping.

72
00:13:37,053 --> 00:13:38,486
Fuel to burn.

73
00:13:39,493 --> 00:13:42,610
They've got the lot:
power, lights, you name it.

74
00:13:43,893 --> 00:13:46,771
You can bet your life they mean to keep it.

75
00:13:47,573 --> 00:13:49,484
Thirty of them in there.

76
00:13:49,653 --> 00:13:51,848
Arrows, flame-throwers, guns!

77
00:13:52,853 --> 00:13:55,526
No place for man or reptile, I thought.

78
00:13:56,853 --> 00:13:58,889
Then this trash arrived...

79
00:13:59,893 --> 00:14:01,804
...as moths to a flame.

80
00:14:01,973 --> 00:14:04,407
Round and round, attack, attack...

81
00:14:05,333 --> 00:14:08,609
...like angry ants,
mad with the smell of gasoline.

82
00:14:24,293 --> 00:14:27,091
In the tanker, that's where they keep it.

83
00:14:28,533 --> 00:14:31,331
Thousands of gallons.
As much as you want.

84
00:14:33,653 --> 00:14:36,690
If anyone's gonna get in there,
it's gonna be you.

85
00:14:36,853 --> 00:14:39,128
Me...l'm gonna feed the snakes.

86
00:14:43,573 --> 00:14:46,929
A man lives by his word, I reckon.
I've kept mine, eh?

87
00:14:56,213 --> 00:14:59,171
We had a deal. I show you the gas
and you let me go, right?

88
00:14:59,253 --> 00:15:01,130
The arrangement was I wouldn't kill you.

89
00:15:01,213 --> 00:15:03,124
After all I've done for you--

90
00:15:03,493 --> 00:15:06,053
I reckon you got a bargain, don't you?

91
00:15:33,013 --> 00:15:35,049
Attack, my vermin, attack!

92
00:15:59,293 --> 00:16:02,729
Onward! Bring me the fuel.
For the glory of Humungus.

93
00:16:02,933 --> 00:16:05,242
For the great glory of Humungus.

94
00:16:09,813 --> 00:16:11,883
Smegma crazies to the left!

95
00:16:14,573 --> 00:16:17,371
The gate! Gayboy berserkers to the gate!

96
00:16:23,573 --> 00:16:25,086
I am your Lord.

97
00:16:29,013 --> 00:16:31,049
Attack, my vermin, attack!

98
00:23:01,893 --> 00:23:04,202
Thank you, thank you, thank you!

99
00:23:04,853 --> 00:23:06,081
Save it.

100
00:23:06,613 --> 00:23:08,888
I'm just here for the gasoline.

101
00:23:15,693 --> 00:23:17,365
As much as you like.

102
00:23:17,533 --> 00:23:19,489
Just take me back there.

103
00:24:04,373 --> 00:24:06,841
Show your weapons and come forward!

104
00:24:10,453 --> 00:24:11,602
Steady now!

105
00:24:14,133 --> 00:24:15,805
Take it real easy!

106
00:24:17,413 --> 00:24:19,244
That's as far as you go!

107
00:24:19,893 --> 00:24:21,292
Turn around!

108
00:24:22,293 --> 00:24:24,523
Nathan! Nathan! It's Nathan!

109
00:24:25,573 --> 00:24:26,892
Lose them!

110
00:24:29,973 --> 00:24:31,452
Open the gate!

111
00:24:36,413 --> 00:24:38,688
Hurry up with that damned stretcher!

112
00:24:40,133 --> 00:24:43,170
Hey, that's fine, that's fine.
Just stay there.

113
00:24:43,573 --> 00:24:45,370
Cover him, cover him!

114
00:24:47,573 --> 00:24:49,325
Come on! Quick, quick!

115
00:24:50,173 --> 00:24:51,811
Oh, what a waste!

116
00:24:52,893 --> 00:24:54,372
Watch his leg!

117
00:24:57,373 --> 00:24:59,125
You and your handiwork!

118
00:24:59,453 --> 00:25:01,205
He didn't stand a chance!

119
00:25:01,373 --> 00:25:04,649
I warned him! You all heard me!
"Madness," I said.

120
00:25:05,213 --> 00:25:07,681
"We can escape. Take our gas," he said.

121
00:25:18,333 --> 00:25:19,971
Get that machine inside!

122
00:25:20,733 --> 00:25:22,564
Close the damned gate!

123
00:25:41,893 --> 00:25:43,292
Who are you?

124
00:25:44,253 --> 00:25:46,323
How did you get through out there?

125
00:25:46,493 --> 00:25:49,291
Look, I want some answers.
Where did you find him?

126
00:25:49,693 --> 00:25:53,003
Two or three miles down the road
left for dead. We had a deal.

127
00:25:53,093 --> 00:25:55,368
There were three other vehicles.
Did you see them?

128
00:25:55,453 --> 00:25:57,921
They're heading to the southwest
in heaps of trouble.

129
00:25:58,013 --> 00:26:00,288
He said if I brought him back
you'd give me some gas.

130
00:26:00,373 --> 00:26:03,683
-Now there's not much time.
-There was a woman in the car.

131
00:26:04,293 --> 00:26:05,442
She's dead.

132
00:26:07,173 --> 00:26:08,845
-What did they do?
-It was quick.

133
00:26:08,933 --> 00:26:11,242
I just want my gas
and I want to get out of here.

134
00:26:11,333 --> 00:26:13,927
Gor all we know he's one of them!
Give him nothing!

135
00:26:14,013 --> 00:26:15,685
She's right, he's a parasite!

136
00:26:15,773 --> 00:26:18,446
Trading in human flesh! Mercenary trash!

137
00:26:19,653 --> 00:26:22,087
-We had an arrangement.
-What do you mean?

138
00:26:22,333 --> 00:26:24,130
You talk to this man.

139
00:26:25,693 --> 00:26:27,923
Try something! Try something!

140
00:26:29,893 --> 00:26:31,372
Try something!

141
00:26:41,253 --> 00:26:43,813
If you had a contract, it was with him.

142
00:26:43,973 --> 00:26:45,691
And it died with him.

143
00:26:45,853 --> 00:26:47,366
Get rid of him!

144
00:26:48,093 --> 00:26:49,208
Left!

145
00:26:56,413 --> 00:26:59,723
Got to hand it to you, treasure!
The last of the V8 lnterceptors!

146
00:26:59,813 --> 00:27:01,531
A piece of history!

147
00:27:02,973 --> 00:27:05,203
Would have been a shame to blow it up.

148
00:27:18,973 --> 00:27:22,409
Here they come! Close the gates!
They're coming back!

149
00:28:29,613 --> 00:28:32,002
Hold your fire! He comes in peace!

150
00:28:33,933 --> 00:28:36,367
Gor Christ's sake, hold your fire!

151
00:29:28,893 --> 00:29:31,043
Greetings from The Humungus!

152
00:29:31,773 --> 00:29:33,445
The Lord Humungus!

153
00:29:34,093 --> 00:29:36,288
The Warrior of the Wasteland!

154
00:29:38,693 --> 00:29:41,082
The Ayatollah of Rock and Roller!

155
00:29:44,813 --> 00:29:46,849
I am gravely disappointed.

156
00:29:47,533 --> 00:29:50,525
Again you have made me unleash my dogs
of war.

157
00:29:51,053 --> 00:29:53,931
Look at what remains
ofyour gallant scouts.

158
00:29:55,213 --> 00:29:57,408
Why? Because you're selfish!

159
00:29:58,573 --> 00:30:00,245
You hoard your gasoline.

160
00:30:01,333 --> 00:30:03,085
Don't listen to him!

161
00:30:03,653 --> 00:30:05,609
Now, my prisoners say...

162
00:30:05,853 --> 00:30:08,890
...you plan to take your gasoline
out of the Wasteland.

163
00:30:09,613 --> 00:30:12,764
You sent them out this morning
to find a vehicle.

164
00:30:13,293 --> 00:30:16,285
A rig big enough to haul
that fat tank of gas.

165
00:30:18,093 --> 00:30:19,731
What a puny plan!

166
00:30:20,253 --> 00:30:21,845
Look around you.

167
00:30:23,973 --> 00:30:25,804
This is the Valley of Death.

168
00:30:26,173 --> 00:30:27,242
See!

169
00:30:28,173 --> 00:30:31,483
Nothing can escape!
The Humungus rules the Wasteland!

170
00:30:31,973 --> 00:30:34,168
Give them nothing! Blow it up!

171
00:30:37,453 --> 00:30:39,603
Humungus will not be defied!

172
00:30:59,053 --> 00:31:00,372
Wez! Wez!

173
00:31:09,293 --> 00:31:11,011
I've got it! I've got it!

174
00:31:24,813 --> 00:31:27,043
Quiet! Quiet! No more games!

175
00:31:28,973 --> 00:31:30,452
No more games!

176
00:31:31,413 --> 00:31:33,165
We're here for a purpose.

177
00:31:33,333 --> 00:31:35,164
We come with an offer.

178
00:31:38,453 --> 00:31:40,125
No! No more talk!

179
00:31:41,853 --> 00:31:43,571
We go in! We kill!

180
00:31:44,173 --> 00:31:45,765
We'll kill them!

181
00:32:03,773 --> 00:32:05,365
Be still my dog of war!

182
00:32:05,973 --> 00:32:07,770
I understand your pain.

183
00:32:07,933 --> 00:32:11,243
We've all lost someone we love.
But we do it my way!

184
00:32:11,853 --> 00:32:13,252
Losers wait!

185
00:32:13,973 --> 00:32:15,565
We do it my way!

186
00:32:16,213 --> 00:32:19,205
Gear is our ally...the gasoline will be ours.

187
00:32:21,213 --> 00:32:23,647
Then, you shall have your revenge.

188
00:32:28,893 --> 00:32:30,372
Take him away!

189
00:32:44,413 --> 00:32:47,530
There has been too much violence,
too much pain.

190
00:32:48,853 --> 00:32:50,889
None here are without sin.

191
00:32:52,133 --> 00:32:54,249
But I have an honorable compromise.

192
00:32:55,093 --> 00:32:56,606
Just walk away.

193
00:32:57,213 --> 00:32:58,612
Give me the pump...

194
00:32:59,213 --> 00:33:00,646
...the oil...

195
00:33:00,973 --> 00:33:02,372
...the gasoline...

196
00:33:02,893 --> 00:33:06,124
...and the whole compound,
and I'll spare your lives.

197
00:33:06,973 --> 00:33:10,807
Just walk away. I will give you
safe passage in the Wasteland.

198
00:33:11,733 --> 00:33:15,169
Just walk away and there will be an end
to the horror.

199
00:33:20,573 --> 00:33:22,325
I await your answer.

200
00:33:22,653 --> 00:33:24,962
You have one full day to decide.

201
00:33:51,253 --> 00:33:53,084
We'll never walk away!

202
00:33:54,333 --> 00:33:55,482
Never!

203
00:34:15,293 --> 00:34:17,966
You heard what he said!
It sounds reasonable!

204
00:34:18,893 --> 00:34:20,690
We don't have to die!

205
00:34:21,333 --> 00:34:23,244
All we have to do is walk away!

206
00:34:23,333 --> 00:34:24,846
No! We've worked too hard!

207
00:34:24,933 --> 00:34:29,051
It's simple! All we do is change the fuel
and this junkyard for our lives!

208
00:34:29,173 --> 00:34:31,562
Look, if we walk out there,
they'll slaughter us!

209
00:34:31,653 --> 00:34:34,850
They'll set us loose
and then cut us down like pigs!

210
00:34:34,973 --> 00:34:36,452
Don't listen to them!

211
00:34:36,613 --> 00:34:38,444
All right, this is it!

212
00:34:39,013 --> 00:34:41,083
I'll talk to this Humungus!

213
00:34:42,573 --> 00:34:44,529
He's a reasonable man...

214
00:34:45,453 --> 00:34:47,364
...open to negotiation.

215
00:34:47,813 --> 00:34:50,452
He promised us safe passage!
He gave his word!

216
00:34:50,773 --> 00:34:52,843
And let us suppose he keeps it...

217
00:34:53,453 --> 00:34:57,048
...and we walk away from here
with our lives. What then?

218
00:36:04,013 --> 00:36:05,366
But remember!

219
00:36:05,533 --> 00:36:08,923
Remember one thing:
That is more than just a tanker of gas.

220
00:36:09,093 --> 00:36:13,006
That is our lifeline to a place
beyond that vermin on machines.

221
00:36:13,973 --> 00:36:15,804
That's 2,000 miles from here!

222
00:36:16,853 --> 00:36:19,731
How do you expect us to get it there?
Drag it?

223
00:36:19,893 --> 00:36:22,646
If we have to, yes! There's always a way!

224
00:36:23,573 --> 00:36:25,291
But the first step:

225
00:36:26,293 --> 00:36:27,885
Defend the fuel.

226
00:36:29,013 --> 00:36:30,162
Words!

227
00:36:30,933 --> 00:36:32,286
Just words!

228
00:36:32,893 --> 00:36:34,611
You'd die for a pipe dream!

229
00:36:34,933 --> 00:36:36,889
We fight for a belief! I stay!

230
00:36:46,013 --> 00:36:48,322
I wish it could have worked, Pappagallo.

231
00:36:48,413 --> 00:36:50,688
You can't expect to compete with that.

232
00:36:51,213 --> 00:36:54,683
Every day we get weaker
while they get stronger. It's finished!

233
00:36:55,133 --> 00:36:56,452
I'm sorry.

234
00:37:02,533 --> 00:37:06,128
Two days ago I saw a vehicle
that could haul that tanker.

235
00:37:07,573 --> 00:37:10,610
If you wanna get out of here...
you talk to me.

236
00:37:16,773 --> 00:37:18,764
Okay, so that's my offer.

237
00:37:18,853 --> 00:37:21,128
I deliver a rig big enough
to haul that tanker...

238
00:37:21,213 --> 00:37:24,808
...you give me back my vehicle
and as much juice as I can carry.

239
00:37:24,933 --> 00:37:27,242
We lost eight good people this morning.

240
00:37:29,253 --> 00:37:31,084
What's he got in mind?

241
00:37:31,653 --> 00:37:34,531
Now, to do the job
I need five gallons of diesel...

242
00:37:34,693 --> 00:37:36,763
...and some high-octane gasoline.

243
00:37:40,173 --> 00:37:42,084
Think of it as a down payment.

244
00:37:42,213 --> 00:37:44,773
And that's the last we'll ever see of him.

245
00:37:44,933 --> 00:37:47,049
He has to come back for his wheels.

246
00:37:47,253 --> 00:37:48,925
What have we got to lose?

247
00:37:51,173 --> 00:37:52,367
You've got yourself a deal.

248
00:38:16,533 --> 00:38:19,331
My vehicle and all the juice I can carry.

249
00:39:08,293 --> 00:39:09,726
Come on, dog.

250
00:41:56,613 --> 00:41:59,605
You know what I miss most of all?
Clean women.

251
00:42:00,693 --> 00:42:02,604
Nail polish, perfume...

252
00:42:04,173 --> 00:42:07,051
...the smell of bicycle seats, cocktails...

253
00:42:08,333 --> 00:42:09,891
-Shut up!
-...desserts.

254
00:42:10,773 --> 00:42:12,968
Lingerie. Remember lingerie?

255
00:42:24,813 --> 00:42:27,202
I knew it! I knew it would work!

256
00:42:27,533 --> 00:42:30,366
Lethal! Lethal these snakes. Born killers.

257
00:42:34,093 --> 00:42:37,130
It's my snake! I trained it.
I'm gonna eat it!

258
00:42:37,293 --> 00:42:39,682
So find your own! Get out of it!

259
00:42:40,973 --> 00:42:43,612
I've got a recipe for snake. Delicious.

260
00:42:44,493 --> 00:42:46,290
Gricassee of reptile.

261
00:42:47,213 --> 00:42:49,249
Better than your dog food!

262
00:42:50,253 --> 00:42:51,481
Pure protein...

263
00:42:51,773 --> 00:42:55,288
...minerals, vitamins.
A man's gotta look after himself.

264
00:42:56,653 --> 00:42:58,962
Healthy mind, healthy body, dog.

265
00:42:59,693 --> 00:43:01,968
You are what you eat, I reckon.

266
00:43:02,293 --> 00:43:03,362
Get away!

267
00:43:03,733 --> 00:43:06,531
You two ought to take a look
in the mirror some time.

268
00:43:06,613 --> 00:43:08,331
No style, no taste.

269
00:43:10,573 --> 00:43:11,722
Empty!

270
00:43:12,493 --> 00:43:13,972
All this time!

271
00:43:18,253 --> 00:43:20,164
That's dishonest...low!

272
00:43:24,373 --> 00:43:26,887
Let's have a look at this machine of yours.

273
00:43:27,533 --> 00:43:29,763
How do I know that one's not a dud?

274
00:43:30,453 --> 00:43:31,727
Gind out.

275
00:43:34,613 --> 00:43:38,083
You've got to understand the basics
of aerodynamics in a thing like this.

276
00:43:38,173 --> 00:43:39,811
Shut up, shut up!

277
00:44:22,733 --> 00:44:25,770
What about me?
You're not gonna leave me here, are you?

278
00:44:29,213 --> 00:44:30,851
Do what you want.

279
00:44:32,773 --> 00:44:34,286
We're partners!

280
00:44:42,533 --> 00:44:44,603
You and me, we're partners!

281
00:44:46,573 --> 00:44:47,847
Partners!

282
00:45:53,573 --> 00:45:54,801
Go! Go!

283
00:49:16,493 --> 00:49:18,449
My dogs, run! The gate!

284
00:49:23,493 --> 00:49:25,245
The gate! The gate!

285
00:50:44,653 --> 00:50:46,405
You! You can run...

286
00:50:46,733 --> 00:50:48,564
...but you can't hide!

287
00:51:13,053 --> 00:51:14,805
You did a great job.

288
00:51:19,413 --> 00:51:21,324
Don't go overboard now.

289
00:51:22,253 --> 00:51:25,404
Don't touch, please.
It's a precision instrument.

290
00:51:36,973 --> 00:51:38,372
Don't touch!

291
00:51:48,133 --> 00:51:50,806
Tell me, son...this machine of yours...

292
00:51:52,013 --> 00:51:54,083
...it can take two, can it?

293
00:51:56,013 --> 00:51:57,287
Possibly.

294
00:52:02,933 --> 00:52:06,289
I'm okay. Just get them organized.
We're moving out tonight.

295
00:52:10,133 --> 00:52:13,250
Okay, listen, everyone.
We're going out tonight.

296
00:52:13,653 --> 00:52:16,008
You all know what to do,
just get on with it.

297
00:52:16,093 --> 00:52:18,732
Timbo, Derek...Pappagallo's been hurt.

298
00:52:20,053 --> 00:52:21,532
How's the rig?

299
00:52:22,333 --> 00:52:23,925
The rig. How is she?

300
00:52:24,013 --> 00:52:27,688
Cracked timing case cover. It's broken
a couple of teeth off the timing gears.

301
00:52:27,773 --> 00:52:30,685
Got a cracked timing case cover.
It's broken...

302
00:52:30,773 --> 00:52:33,207
...a couple of teeth off the timing gear.

303
00:52:33,533 --> 00:52:35,649
The radiator's damaged at the core.

304
00:52:36,533 --> 00:52:38,444
It's got a cracked water pump.

305
00:52:39,253 --> 00:52:41,483
It's got a fractured injector line.

306
00:52:41,653 --> 00:52:42,972
Well, what does all that mean?

307
00:52:43,053 --> 00:52:45,203
Yeah, okay, but what does that mean?

308
00:52:45,773 --> 00:52:48,162
-What does that mean?
-Twenty-four hours!

309
00:52:50,053 --> 00:52:51,452
They got twelve!

310
00:52:52,373 --> 00:52:53,772
You've got twelve!

311
00:53:02,933 --> 00:53:05,242
Listen, I was wrong about you...

312
00:53:05,813 --> 00:53:07,451
...and I'm sorry.

313
00:53:23,733 --> 00:53:26,531
It's a long time since
I've seen driving like that, man.

314
00:53:26,613 --> 00:53:28,524
You're okay by me, son.

315
00:53:28,693 --> 00:53:32,129
With you driving that rig, we got it licked!
Nice to have you aboard.

316
00:53:32,213 --> 00:53:34,932
I've been saving these.
I want you to have them.

317
00:53:38,613 --> 00:53:40,524
Thank you, and welcome.

318
00:53:43,573 --> 00:53:46,929
It's been a pleasure doing business
with you, but I'm leaving.

319
00:53:54,973 --> 00:53:56,611
Oh, my God, look!

320
00:53:56,813 --> 00:53:58,326
Up on the hill!

321
00:53:59,253 --> 00:54:02,006
They're stringing them up, the bastards!

322
00:54:03,293 --> 00:54:04,408
Look!

323
00:54:10,453 --> 00:54:13,047
You have defied me! You will know...

324
00:54:14,733 --> 00:54:17,372
...the vengeance of The Lord Humungus!

325
00:54:18,453 --> 00:54:20,045
I promise you...

326
00:54:21,093 --> 00:54:22,845
...nobody, nobody...

327
00:54:24,373 --> 00:54:26,409
...gets out of here alive!

328
00:55:15,573 --> 00:55:18,690
Who's supposed to be helping out
with the drums?

329
00:55:19,653 --> 00:55:20,722
Come on!

330
00:55:28,293 --> 00:55:30,602
Come on with the drums, come on!

331
00:56:09,533 --> 00:56:11,444
What's wrong? Come on.

332
00:56:12,733 --> 00:56:15,611
It just seems wrong
sneaking away like this.

333
00:56:19,773 --> 00:56:22,651
But you said you wanted to come,
sweetheart.

334
00:56:23,613 --> 00:56:25,046
I know I did.

335
00:56:26,293 --> 00:56:29,603
Look, you're scared now.
Come on, it'll be much safer up there.

336
00:56:29,693 --> 00:56:31,843
What are we waiting for, eh?

337
00:56:33,693 --> 00:56:35,365
This is my family.

338
00:56:36,733 --> 00:56:39,247
I'm not going to leave these people.

339
00:56:40,533 --> 00:56:41,932
I'm staying.

340
00:56:43,613 --> 00:56:44,932
I'm sorry.

341
00:57:11,253 --> 00:57:13,164
Come on, I'll show you!

342
00:57:14,253 --> 00:57:16,289
I told you. He's leaving.

343
00:57:20,013 --> 00:57:23,972
Look, I don't have time for long speeches,
I want you to drive the tanker.

344
00:57:25,853 --> 00:57:27,002
Sorry.

345
00:57:28,253 --> 00:57:31,404
We had a contract.
I kept my part of the bargain.

346
00:57:32,093 --> 00:57:34,004
We'll make a new contract.

347
00:57:37,853 --> 00:57:39,844
I've got all I need here.

348
00:57:40,213 --> 00:57:44,092
You don't have a future.
I could offer you that. Rebuild our lives.

349
00:57:45,453 --> 00:57:47,444
Buy a ticket for 2,000 miles.

350
00:57:47,773 --> 00:57:51,607
You have to come, sonny.
This is where we're going. Paradise!

351
00:57:52,813 --> 00:57:54,644
2,000 miles from here.

352
00:57:54,973 --> 00:57:57,407
Gresh water, plenty of sunshine....

353
00:57:57,733 --> 00:57:59,689
Nothing to do but breed.

354
00:58:01,213 --> 00:58:02,487
No thanks.

355
00:58:03,293 --> 00:58:06,171
What is it with you?
What are you looking for?

356
00:58:06,813 --> 00:58:09,532
Come on, Max,
everyone's looking for something.

357
00:58:10,013 --> 00:58:12,208
You happy out there, are you?

358
00:58:12,413 --> 00:58:15,530
Eh? Wandering...
one day blurring into another?

359
00:58:15,933 --> 00:58:18,686
You're a scavenger, Max. You're a maggot.

360
00:58:19,293 --> 00:58:23,127
Do you know that? You're living
off the corpse of the old world.

361
00:58:24,013 --> 00:58:27,210
Tell me your story, Max.
What burned you out, huh?

362
00:58:27,853 --> 00:58:31,482
Kill one man too many? See too many
people die? Lose some family?

363
00:58:31,613 --> 00:58:35,970
Oh, so that's it. You lost some family.
That make you something special, does it?

364
00:58:36,213 --> 00:58:37,646
Listen to me.

365
00:58:58,973 --> 00:59:01,851
Do you think you're the only one
that's suffered?

366
00:59:02,013 --> 00:59:05,688
We've all been through it in here,
but we haven't given up.

367
00:59:06,933 --> 00:59:09,572
We're still human beings with dignity.

368
00:59:10,013 --> 00:59:12,891
But you, you're out there with the garbage.

369
00:59:14,013 --> 00:59:15,526
You're nothing!

370
00:59:55,453 --> 00:59:56,886
Get out, kid!

371
00:59:59,813 --> 01:00:01,724
Go on, get out of here.

372
01:00:22,293 --> 01:00:24,602
Go on, get out. Scat! Get out!

373
01:00:55,013 --> 01:00:56,844
You're letting him go?

374
01:00:58,693 --> 01:01:01,332
Well, let's keep his vehicle at least.

375
01:01:01,573 --> 01:01:04,724
He fulfilled his contract.
He's an honorable man.

376
01:01:06,533 --> 01:01:09,172
Okay, so who's gonna drive the tanker?

377
01:01:10,373 --> 01:01:11,488
I am.

378
01:01:37,333 --> 01:01:39,767
They've got you wrong,
you're not a coward.

379
01:01:39,853 --> 01:01:42,162
Stupid, maybe, but not a coward.

380
01:01:43,213 --> 01:01:45,647
You're making a serious mistake...

381
01:01:46,373 --> 01:01:48,409
...splitting a great team.

382
01:01:49,613 --> 01:01:52,252
You and me together,
think of the possibilities.

383
01:01:52,333 --> 01:01:55,166
See you around, maybe.
Good-bye, good luck.

384
01:02:21,773 --> 01:02:22,728
We go!

385
01:02:32,813 --> 01:02:34,883
You disobey me! You puppy!

386
01:03:35,773 --> 01:03:37,843
Toadie, the gas! Hurry up!

387
01:03:46,253 --> 01:03:48,687
Don't waste him! lf he's alive...

388
01:03:49,773 --> 01:03:51,252
...l want him!

389
01:04:16,293 --> 01:04:19,649
The tanks are full, O mighty Wez,
and it's all yours.

390
01:05:13,133 --> 01:05:15,124
It's all over. Let's go!

391
01:05:28,493 --> 01:05:30,131
Look! Out there.

392
01:05:38,893 --> 01:05:40,167
Oh, hell!

393
01:05:42,573 --> 01:05:44,404
You blew it, you fool!

394
01:06:58,413 --> 01:06:59,926
Relax, partner!

395
01:08:33,253 --> 01:08:35,209
I'll be driving the tanker.

396
01:08:36,213 --> 01:08:38,852
We're going to crash or crash through.

397
01:08:40,653 --> 01:08:44,009
Now, at this point, that's all they want:
the tanker.

398
01:08:44,333 --> 01:08:46,403
So they'll come straight after us.

399
01:08:46,573 --> 01:08:49,292
So we'll use that to punch our way out...

400
01:08:49,573 --> 01:08:52,645
...which will give all of you a very,
very good chance.

401
01:08:52,813 --> 01:08:54,371
Now, don't hesitate!

402
01:08:54,533 --> 01:08:58,367
Once you're outside there,
split up and go as hard as you can.

403
01:08:59,533 --> 01:09:01,763
Now, 200 miles to the north...

404
01:09:02,093 --> 01:09:05,449
...there's a place with a bridge
called Powder River.

405
01:09:06,693 --> 01:09:08,524
That's our rendezvous.

406
01:09:09,933 --> 01:09:11,685
Give us till sunset.

407
01:09:12,613 --> 01:09:15,491
If we haven't made it by then...keep going.

408
01:09:16,773 --> 01:09:18,809
Good enough for me to build,
but not to ride.

409
01:09:18,893 --> 01:09:20,406
You're not coming on this tanker!

410
01:09:20,493 --> 01:09:22,370
I sweated blood on this.
No bastard's gonna to tell me...

411
01:09:22,453 --> 01:09:25,923
-...to ride in no lousy school bus!
-Okay, settle down!

412
01:09:26,213 --> 01:09:28,124
If it's all the same to you...

413
01:09:29,973 --> 01:09:31,691
...l'll drive that tanker.

414
01:09:33,253 --> 01:09:35,926
The offer is closed. Too late for deals.

415
01:09:37,413 --> 01:09:40,007
No deals. I want to drive the truck.

416
01:09:40,693 --> 01:09:43,127
Why? Why the big change of heart?

417
01:09:43,493 --> 01:09:45,324
Believe me, I haven't got a choice.

418
01:09:45,413 --> 01:09:47,643
And how do you think you'll do it?

419
01:09:47,813 --> 01:09:51,442
I mean, look at you.
You couldn't even drive a wheelchair!

420
01:09:52,613 --> 01:09:55,491
You should look at yourself, Max.
You're a mess.

421
01:09:56,693 --> 01:09:58,524
Come on, cut the crap!

422
01:10:00,373 --> 01:10:02,648
I'm the best chance you've got.

423
01:10:10,453 --> 01:10:12,409
Right, let's get moving!

424
01:11:21,053 --> 01:11:23,328
Move that kid! Get rid of him!

425
01:12:36,653 --> 01:12:37,768
Shit!

426
01:15:44,893 --> 01:15:46,121
Go! Go!

427
01:16:56,333 --> 01:16:58,244
I'm all right! I'm all right!

428
01:17:04,373 --> 01:17:06,045
Got her! Got her!

429
01:17:36,613 --> 01:17:38,285
Come on! Come on!

430
01:19:30,053 --> 01:19:32,089
The tire! Shoot the tire!

431
01:22:01,053 --> 01:22:02,805
Boy! Come on, jump!

432
01:22:08,013 --> 01:22:09,332
We've won!

433
01:22:09,613 --> 01:22:11,126
It's over, boy.

434
01:23:57,373 --> 01:23:58,567
Get the bullet!

435
01:24:05,373 --> 01:24:06,852
Get the shell.

436
01:27:34,973 --> 01:27:37,965
And so began thejourney north...
to safety...

437
01:27:38,733 --> 01:27:40,485
...to our place in the sun.

438
01:27:40,653 --> 01:27:44,612
Among us we found a new leader:
The man who came from the sky...

439
01:27:44,813 --> 01:27:46,565
...the Gyro Captain.

440
01:27:47,013 --> 01:27:49,288
Andjust as Pappagallo had planned...

441
01:27:49,453 --> 01:27:52,923
...we traveled far beyond the reach
of men on machines.

442
01:27:53,453 --> 01:27:57,082
Thejuice, the preciousjuice,
was hidden in the vehicles.

443
01:27:58,733 --> 01:28:01,008
As for me, I grew to manhood...

444
01:28:01,613 --> 01:28:04,650
...and in the fullness of time,
I became the leader...

445
01:28:04,813 --> 01:28:07,373
...the Chief of the Great Northern Tribe.

446
01:28:08,933 --> 01:28:10,730
And the Road Warrior?

447
01:28:11,533 --> 01:28:14,127
That was the last we ever saw of him.

448
01:28:14,893 --> 01:28:16,406
He lives now...

449
01:28:17,453 --> 01:28:19,364
...only in my memories.

450
01:28:28,853 --> 01:28:31,242
