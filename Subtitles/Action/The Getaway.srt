01:51:22,655 --> 01:51:24,885
...that's the problem
in this goddamned world.

1058
01:51:24,975 --> 01:51:26,567
There ain't no morals.

1059
01:51:27,895 --> 01:51:31,251
Kids figure if they ain't living together,
they ain't living.

1060
01:51:48,655 --> 01:51:50,168
INSPECTOR: Buenas tardes.

1061
01:51:50,255 --> 01:51:53,008
SLIM: Chihuahua City. Building materials.

1062
01:52:00,535 --> 01:52:01,604
DOC: Crazy.

1063
01:52:08,215 --> 01:52:10,524
SLIM: You know, if I was you kids,
what I'd do?

1064
01:52:10,615 --> 01:52:12,890
SLIM: I'd quit this running around
the country.

1065
01:52:12,975 --> 01:52:15,125
You know, get a little bit
of money together...

1066
01:52:15,215 --> 01:52:18,525
...and I'd buy a place and settle down,
and raise a family.

1067
01:52:19,335 --> 01:52:21,644
I've been married for 35 years.

1068
01:52:22,135 --> 01:52:24,774
Same old gal. Man, she's a tough old hide.

1069
01:52:25,375 --> 01:52:27,809
Yeah, everything I am, I owe to her.

1070
01:52:39,015 --> 01:52:39,970
Say...

1071
01:52:41,095 --> 01:52:43,051
Pull over, over here, would you?

1072
01:52:43,535 --> 01:52:45,127
Okay, whatever you say.

1073
01:52:51,495 --> 01:52:52,530
Now what?

1074
01:52:53,295 --> 01:52:55,047
DOC: Let's get out a spell.

1075
01:53:25,655 --> 01:53:27,930
How much money did you make last year?

1076
01:53:33,575 --> 01:53:34,974
SLIM: Oh...

1077
01:53:37,135 --> 01:53:39,046
I reckon about $5,000.

1078
01:53:41,775 --> 01:53:44,608
Suppose I give you $10,000
for that truck of yours?

1079
01:53:46,215 --> 01:53:47,443
You serious?

1080
01:53:47,575 --> 01:53:48,564
I am.

1081
01:53:50,855 --> 01:53:52,846
And I keep my mouth shut...

1082
01:53:53,335 --> 01:53:56,213
SLIM: ...and I don't say nothing
about the truck...

1083
01:53:56,295 --> 01:53:59,093
...and I never seen neither one
of the two of you?

1084
01:54:00,735 --> 01:54:02,214
That's what I want.

1085
01:54:12,815 --> 01:54:14,214
How about $20,000?

1086
01:54:14,295 --> 01:54:15,330
[Doc chuckles]

1087
01:54:15,415 --> 01:54:16,814
How about $30,000?

1088
01:54:18,975 --> 01:54:21,045
Goddamn, ma'am, you got a deal.

1089
01:54:23,535 --> 01:54:25,173
DOC: Pay the man, honey.

1090
01:54:28,335 --> 01:54:29,290
Thank you, ma'am.

1091
01:54:29,375 --> 01:54:31,969
DOC: Now, you'll have to walk on
back to the border.

1092
01:54:32,055 --> 01:54:34,615
Oh, that's all right. Don't worry about me.

1093
01:54:40,535 --> 01:54:42,890
I hope you find what you're looking for.

1094
01:54:42,975 --> 01:54:44,727
SLIM: Vaya con Dios.

1095
01:54:44,975 --> 01:54:46,249
You too, ma'am.

1096
01:54:50,855 --> 01:54:52,732
SLIM: Take care, you hear?

1097
01:54:54,575 --> 01:54:55,724
SLIM: Goddamn it!

1098
01:54:55,815 --> 01:54:57,487
[Slim chuckles]

1099
01:55:07,055 --> 01:55:08,283
Come on.

1100
