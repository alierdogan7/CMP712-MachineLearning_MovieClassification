12
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:36,794
Yes, as a matter of fact, there is.

13
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:41,237
There is something I'd like you

I want the operation done tonight.
There's no time left.

20
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:04,916
But, señor Blofeld, this is
a most delicate procedure.

21
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,116

22
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:21,428

25
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:43,509
Such a pity. I was dying to see
how the operation turned out.

26
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:46,589
Get his gun.

- The Akbar Shah: 116 carats rough.

63
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:50,837
But there's no need to bring in our section
on a relatively simple smuggling matter.

64
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:53,514
Sir Donald has convinced
the PM otherwise.

65

May I remind you, 007,
that Blofeld's dead? Finished.

66

The least we can expect from you now

Good morning, gentlemen.
Sir Donald will see you now.

68
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:08,031
Thank you.

69
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:10,793
Morning, Sir Donald.
This is Commander Bond.

70
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:13,872
How do you do, Commander Bond?
Please sit down.

71
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:16,428
- Sherry?
- Not for me. Doctor's orders.

72
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:18,795
- Commander Bond?
- Yes, thank you.

73
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:23,829
You've been on holiday, I understand.
Relaxing, I hope.

74
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:26,992
Hardly relaxing, but most satisfying.

75
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:29,071
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

76
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:34,432
Pity about your liver.
It's an unusually fine Solera.

77
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:38,513
- '51, I believe.
- There is no year for sherry, 007.

78
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:43,799
I was referring to the original vintage
on which the sherry is based, sir.

79
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:47,311
1851.

80
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:50,873
- Unmistakable.
- Precisely.

81
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:54,350
Tell me, Commander,
how far does your expertise

82
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:56,874
extend into the field of diamonds?

83
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:01,755
Hardest substance found in nature.
They cut glass. Suggest marriage.

84
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:04,957
They've replaced a dog
as a girl's best friend. That's it.

85
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:08,350
Refreshing to hear there's one subject
you're not an expert on.

86
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:13,594
Yes, well, perhaps I'd better give you
a brief background into our problem.

87
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:17,798
80 per cent of the world's diamonds
come from mines in South Africa.

88
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:20,917
<i>Most are dug out of shafts</i>
<i>of diamond-bearing clay</i>

89
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,833
<i>at depths of up to 3000 feet.</i>

90
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:27,879
<i>The whole process operates</i>
<i>under an airtight security system.</i>

91
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:29,791
<i>It's an essential precaution,</i>

92
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:36,228
<i>even though the industry prides itself on</i>
<i>the loyalty and devotion of its workers.</i>

93
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:40,836
<i>Naturally the security measures</i>
<i>tend to ensure that loyalty,</i>

94
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:44,469
<i>as do the extensive amenities</i>
<i>and social services we provide.</i>

95
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:48,553
<i>There's a permanent staff</i>
<i>of doctors and nurses, even dentists.</i>

96
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:53,475
<i>The whole process operates</i>
<i>under an airtight security system.</i>

97
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:55,232
<i>It's a necessary precaution,</i>

98
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:59,108
<i>even though the industry prides itself on</i>
<i>the loyalty and devotion of its workers.</i>

99
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,191
Next.

100
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:07,551
<i>(man)</i> The scorpion.

101
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:10,108
Mother nature's finest killer, Mr Wint.

102
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:14,990
One is never too old
to learn from a master, Mr Kidd.

103
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:38,595
Dr Tynan? Good evening.

104
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:42,832
- Who are you? And where is Joe?
- Joe couldn't make it tonight.

105
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:46,799
I'm Mr Wint. This is Mr Kidd.

106
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:51,471
I see.

107
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:06,068
<i>(groans)</i>

108
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:10,472
- What's the matter with him?
- My wisdom teeth. I haven't had 'em out.

109
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:14,235
- Would you mind having a look, Doctor?
- Of course.

110
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:18,393
I'm not going to hurt you. Just open.
No, no, no, open wide.

111
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:25,950
Argh!

112
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:36,516
Curious how everyone who touches
those diamonds seems to die.

113
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:53,036
- <i>(man)</i> Stop right there. Who are you?
- Dr Tynan sent us.

114
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:55,634
- Why didn't he come himself?
- He was taken sick.

115
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:59,918
Bitten by the bug. He sent this for you.

116
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,916
If God had wanted man to fly...

117
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,675
He would have given him wings, Mr Kidd.

118
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:31,794
No security system is perfect. We've
always accepted a degree of smuggling.

119
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:36,829
But over the past two years, despite all
our precautions, it's gone up alarmingly.

120
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:41,391
- None of the stones reach the market.
- Sir Donald thinks someone's stockpiling.

121
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:46,634
What concerns us is someone dumping
the stones on the market, or...

122
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:49,553
Making you agree to perpetual blackmail.

123
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:51,631
Exactly.

124
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:57,919
What we need to know
is who the stockpilers are.

125
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,470
The letter U is for "umbrella".

126
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,275
We take it lest it rain.

127
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:08,399
We hope we shan't want it
till we're home again.

128
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:12,268
- Two men to see you, missy.
- <i>(teacher)</i> "Gentlemen", Joshua.

129
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:17,115
I shan't be long, children.
Joshua is going to read you a story.

130
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:21,671
How nice to see you again.
Where to this time?

131
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:25,070
- Amsterdam.
- Amsterdam, how lovely.

132
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:28,197
I'll have to bring back
some pictures for the children.

133
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:31,352
Ask, and ye shall receive, Mrs Whistler.

134
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:37,715
Thus endeth the lesson for today,
gentlemen.

135
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:41,634
Several recent murders in South Africa
have complicated matters.

136
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:44,757
If they shut down operations
before we discover them...

137
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:49,197
It would be catastrophic for us
and for the government.

138
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:53,193
- I've always fancied a trip to South Africa.
- You're going to Holland.

139
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:58,838
For some time now, we've had our eyes
on a professional smuggler, Peter Franks.

140
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:02,117
- He's due to leave for Amsterdam.
- Do we know his contacts?

141
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:05,749
We do function in your absence,
Commander.

142
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,795
Passport, sir?

143
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:16,910
Mr Franks, there's a message
for you at Passport Control.

144
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,037
That door over there.
You can park your car outside.

145
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:22,111
Thank you.

146
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:50,917
Mr Franks, your passport is quite in order.

147
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:57,311
Anyone seeing you in that outfit would
be discouraged from leaving the country.

148
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:59,595
What can I bring you back from Holland?

149
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:02,433
A diamond? In a ring?

150
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:07,869
Would you settle for a tulip?

151
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:10,835
Yes.

152
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:36,075
<i>(woman on PA) Ahead is one of the oldest</i>

153
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:41,154

<i>who wanted to visit each other every day.</i>

154
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:46,360
<i>Unfortunately they ran out of money. So</i>

<i>Oh.</i>

158
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:12,749
Mrs Whistler did want some pictures
of the canals for the children.

159
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:17,960
How kind of you, Mr Kidd.
The children will be so thrilled.

160
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:45,237

- Franks. Peter Franks.

161
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:47,072
<i>Come up. Third floor.</i>

162
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:07,792
Make yourself at home.
I'll be out in a minute.

163
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:14,591
Help yourself to a drink.

164
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:16,671
Is Mr Case not at home?

165
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:21,356
There is no Mr Case. The T is for Tiffany.

166
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:25,797
Tiffany Case? Definitely distinctive.

167
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:30,908
I was born there, on the first floor, while
my mother looked for a wedding ring.

168
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,390
I'm glad for your sake
it wasn't Van Cleef and Arpels.

169
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:40,959
Weren't you a blonde when I came in?

170
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:42,678
Could be.

171
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:47,197
I tend to notice little things like that.
Whether a girl is a blonde or a brunette.

172
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:50,192
And which do you prefer?

173
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:53,590
Providing the collars and cuffs match...

174
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:57,150
We'll talk about that later.
Let me have your glass.

175
00:17:57,240 --> 00:18:00,312
I'll get you some ice.

176
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:30,679
That's quite a nice little nothing
you're almost wearing. I approve.

177
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:35,754
I don't dress for the hired help.
Let's see your passport, Franks.

178
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:42,712
Occupation: Transport consultant?
That's a little cute, isn't it?

179
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:46,398
- I'll finish dressing.
- Don't. Not on my account.

180
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:29,917
I don't care much for redheads.
Terrible tempers.

181
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,959
- But somehow it seems to suit you.
- It's my own.

182
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:37,191
But it needs some soft lighting.
I know this restaurant...

183
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:40,670
- I never mix business with pleasure.
- Neither do I.

184
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:43,718
Good. We can start
by saving the cute remarks

185
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:46,951
until after you get
the diamonds into Los Angeles.

186
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:51,795
- Where are they now?
- Your problem is getting them in.

187
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:55,316
- How much is there?
- 50,000 carats.

188
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:59,837
At 142 carats an ounce, that's an awful lot
of ice. That won't be easy.

189
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:02,798
That's why you're being paid 50 grand.

190
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:05,838
What did you think it was going to be?
A pair of earrings?

191
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:10,072
And, Franks, for God's sakes,
come up with something original.

192
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:18,591
I've got to hand it to you, Q.
Quite ingenious.

193
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:21,911
An obvious little notion.
Thought it might come in handy.

194
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,912
By the way, M's been trying
to get in touch with you.

195
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,150
That Peter Franks has escaped.

196
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:30,990
<i>He killed one of the guards</i>
<i>on the way up to London.</i>

197
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:32,069
Hello?

198
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:36,592
Hello? Are you there?

199
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:37,908
Oh!

200
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:58,272
- <i>(Tiffany) Yes?</i>
- Peter Franks.

201
00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:00,635
<i>Third floor.</i>

202
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:03,188
- <i>Guten abend.</i>
- Good evening.

203
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:06,390
<i>Bitte.</i>

204
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:09,678
- <i>(German accent)</i> You are English?
- Yes, I'm English.

205
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:11,955
I speak English.

206
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,594
- Who is your floor?
- Three, please.

207
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:40,237
- Is he dead?
- I sincerely hope so.

208
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:49,031
- Who is he?
- No idea.

209
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:52,351
This chap's been following me
all day today.

210
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:58,789
My God!

211
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:02,269
You've just killed James Bond.

212
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:10,949
Is that who it was?
It just proves no one's indestructible.

213
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:14,635
You don't kill James Bond and
sit waiting for the cops to arrive.

214
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:17,109
We've got to get
the diamonds out of here fast.

215
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:19,475
Where are they?

216
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:24,596
A little old lady dropped them by
yesterday morning.

217
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:28,271
Priceless.

218
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:33,910
I think we ought to let Mr Bond
carry the load from here on out.

219
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:51,629
It's funny. All the things one wanted to
say to one's brother when it's all too late.

220
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:54,393
Let me assure you
of our deepest condolences.

221
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:57,472
Would you please board the aircraft?

222
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:02,990
- We were inseparable, you know.
- Please, Mr Franks.

223
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:11,312
<i>(air stewardess) Lufthansa announce the</i>
<i>departure of flight, LH450 to Los Angeles.</i>

224
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:19,916
<i>Will you please fasten your seatbelts?</i>
<i>No smoking until airborne. Thank you.</i>

225
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:26,151
They're both aboard. I must say,
Miss Case seems quite attractive.

226
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:28,435
For a lady.

227
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:32,550
<i>(laughs)</i>

228
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:38,397

<i>of their flight, LH450 from Amsterdam.</i>

229
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:40,436

- Yes?

230
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:42,909
Follow me to Customs, please.

231
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:48,870
Peter Franks, Jerry.

232
00:25:57,320 --> 00:26:00,517
Get some lunch, Jerry. I'll take over.

233
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:04,708
Death certificate, please, Mr Franks.

234
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:08,588
Well, well, well. Felix Leiter, you old fraud.

235
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:13,993
On behalf of the CIA, welcome to America.

236
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:17,470
Someone sent their brain trust
down to meet you.

237
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:29,878
I give up. I know the diamonds
are in the body, but where?

238
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:32,758
Alimentary, Dr Leiter.

239
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:38,510
So long, James. Keep in touch.

240
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:42,718
The rest of your luggage has been
cleared, Mr Franks. OK, fellas.

241
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:06,598
You wanna sit in the front, Mr Franks?

242
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:10,036
It's a lot smoother ride
in the front, Mr Franks.

243
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:12,918
Yes, I believe I'll sit in front.

244
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:37,471
The stiff... <i>(clears throat)</i> deceased
back there. Your brother, Mr Franks?

245
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:39,551
Yes, it was.

246
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:41,631
I got a brudder.

247
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:45,757
Small world.

248
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:01,231
<i>(soothing organ music)</i>

249
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:10,231
Mr Franks, I'm Morton Slumber.

250
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:14,632
Please accept my heartfelt
condolences at this most difficult hour.

251
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:18,110
Well, he is heading
for a better world, Mr Slumber.

252
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:20,555
There is some consolation in that.

253
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:24,838
Now then, if we're ready
to begin the final journey...

254
00:28:57,280 --> 00:29:00,238
- May his soul rest in peace.
- Oh, yes. Amen.

255
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:04,472
If you would care to follow me into
my office, we will bring you the urn.

256
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:08,314
I'm happy you chose our half-couch,
hinged-panel, slumber-on casket.

257
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:11,198
I'm sure your brother
would have appreciated it.

258
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:13,714
I'm sure he did.

259
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:15,791
Please, be seated.

260
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:41,314
Ashes to ashes...

261
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:43,391
- Dust to dust.
- Exactly.

262
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:47,598
At a moment like this, I'm sure you'd
rather be left alone for reflection.

263
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:48,874
Most thoughtful.

264
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:52,316
We've selected a private niche
in our Garden of Remembrance.

265
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:57,110
It's the one with the restful chartreuse
curtains and the Angel's Breath gold trim.

266
00:29:57,200 --> 00:30:02,274
- I hope you'll find everything in order.
- It has all been impeccable, Mr Slumber.

267
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:04,351
So far.

268
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:22,678
Very moving.

269
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:26,355
- Heart-warming, Mr Wint.
- A glowing tribute, Mr Kidd.

270
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:18,272
You dirty, double-crossin' limey fink.
Those goddamn diamonds are phonies.

271
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:24,189
Now, don't tell me. You're St Peter?

272
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:26,714
Paste, glass. Where's the real stuff?

273
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:30,998
Where's the real money? You wouldn't
burn up 50,000 real dollars, would you?

274
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:34,834
One last break, Franks.
Where are the real diamonds?

275
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:37,912
Get me the real money,
I'll bring you the real diamonds.

276
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,797
Where are you goin'?

277
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:42,952
I hear that the Hotel Tropicana
is quite comfortable.

278
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:45,554
My condolences, gentlemen.

279
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:49,518
Hello, Felix. Very comfortable.

280
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:52,990
There's one problem.
I want the real merchandise - quickly.

281
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:56,356
<i>Q has just arrived with it.</i>
<i>We'll be up with them in the morning.</i>

282
00:32:56,440 --> 00:33:00,069
<i>So I'd sit tight, if I were you.</i>
<i>No sense in looking for trouble.</i>

283
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:03,789
<i>Just enjoy yourself, James.</i>
<i>I'm sure you know how.</i>

284
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:07,589
Quite. I'll probably
take in a show, or something.

285
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:44,151
<i>(distant laughter)</i>

286
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:49,149
<i>(man)</i> How do you like me so far?

287
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:51,708
People say I have
the body of Rock Hudson.

288
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:55,475
If he ever finds out what I'm doin' to it,
he'll be madder than hell.

289
00:33:55,560 --> 00:33:58,518
I call these girls my Acorns.

290
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:01,956
They're a gift from Willard Whyte,
who is upstairs right now,

291
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:05,237
playing Monopoly with real buildings.

292
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:10,713
Tryin' to find Willard Whyte is like
tryin' to find a virgin in a maternity ward.

293
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:14,509
And on behalf of the Whyte House,
I wanna let you folks know,

294
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:19,469
you've been a lousy audience.
So get lost. See ya later.

295
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:39,755
<i>(Mr Wint)</i> Shady Tree.

296
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:44,798
Shady, we just adored your act.

297
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:47,792
- What taste, style.
- We have a few suggestions.

298
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:51,873
Critics and material I don't need.
I haven't changed my act in 40 years.

299
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:59,360
Hold it. Don't go in there.

300
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:04,714
We didn't get the real diamonds,
so we need Tree alive.

301
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:07,758
That's most annoying.

302
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:25,713
<i>(man shouts)</i>

303
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:27,677
The loser...

304
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:30,752
That's it, pussycat. I shot the whole wad.

305
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:32,831
What do you say? Back to my place?

306
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:36,469
You're a nice person, Maxie.
Really, you are.

307
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:40,439
Why don't you go take a nap,
and I'll see you next year?

308
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:44,877
<i>(Bond)</i> May I have 5000 dollars?
No, make it 10,000. 2000 dollar limit.

309
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:52,112
- Is there some problem?
- Mr Saxby?

310
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:56,796
This gentleman wants 10,000 dollar credit
with a 2000 dollar limit.

311
00:35:56,880 --> 00:36:00,316
My name is Franks. Peter Franks.

312
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:04,716
Mr Franks' credit's good.
Good luck to you, Mr Franks.

313
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:07,792
Thank you. I'll have two stacks now.

314
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:10,713
Give the gentleman 4000.

315
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:12,438
<i>(Bond)</i> Thank you.

316
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:15,318
- Hi. I'm Plenty.
- But of course you are.

317
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:19,757
- Plenty O'Toole.
- Named after your father, perhaps?

318
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:22,991
Would you like some help?
On the craps, I mean.

319
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:25,071
That's very kind of you.

320
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:28,351
<i>(croupier)</i> Coming up. Coming up.

321
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:32,035
Next shooter is a lady. Ladies are lucky.

322
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:35,950
Nine. Mark nine.

323
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:42,354
Seven, loser. The lucky lady craps out.

324
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:45,872
Your shot, Mr F.

325
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:57,470
- <i>(Southern accent) Willard Whyte.</i>
- Tree is dead. Turn on number two.

<i>(Saxby) It's Peter Franks.</i>

327
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:07,279
Twice ten. Hard ten. Ten's the number.

328
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:11,114
I'll take the full odds on the ten.
200 on the hard way.

329
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:15,193
The limit on all the numbers,
250 on the eleven. Thank you very much.

330
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:18,238
Say, you've played this game before.

331
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:20,311
Just once.

332
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:24,398
- <i>Now what do we do?</i>
- Don't bother me with details.

333
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:26,675
Just get me the diamonds.

334
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:35,193
You handle those cubes
like a monkey handles coconuts.

335
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:39,034
Thank you, gentlemen,
for such a sterling service.

336
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:41,190
Well, that's 50,000 dollars.

337
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:45,353
Minus 5000 for you. Leaves me 45,000,
and thank you very much.

338
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:47,874
Well, it was nothing, really.

339
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:51,919
You know something, Peter Franks?
You're a terrific guy.

340
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,514
A little weird, but a terrific guy.

341
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:57,194
Say, why don't we go someplace
and have a drink?

342
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:58,190
A drink?

343
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:03,235
If you'd like to come in, Plenty.

344
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:07,154
How pretty. What a super place you have.

345
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:28,311
<i>(Plenty)</i> Just give me one second, lover.

346
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:39,471
Good evening.

347
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:46,674
You've caught me
with more than my hands up.

348
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:50,753
What the hell is this?
A perverts' convention, or something?

349
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:54,958
Listen, you can't do this to me.
Stop that. I've got friends in this town.

350
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:06,239
Exceptionally fine shot.

351
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:09,312
I didn't know there was a pool down there.

352
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:16,072
All right. Let's get down to business.
I presume you've come for the real...

353
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:19,437
The real diamonds.

354
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:38,149
Good evening, Miss Case.

355
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:48,959
Sorry about your fulsome friend.
I'll bet you really missed something.

356
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:52,715
The evening may not be
a total loss after all.

357
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:55,075
Why don't we talk a bit first?

358
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:56,912
First?

359
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:00,072
Well, what would you like to talk about?

360
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:03,230
You pick a subject.

361
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:06,471
- Diamonds?
- Good boy.

362
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:10,758
And you want to know where they are,
and whether I'm working alone or not.

363
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:13,434
So far, so good. Keep going.

364
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:16,910
And if not, then with whom.

365
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:22,552
So you can inform your superiors
and acquire the diamonds.

366
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:25,996
Peter, I'm very impressed.

367
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:29,311
There's a lot more to you
than I had expected.

368
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:35,159
Presumably I'm the condemned man,
and obviously you're the hearty breakfast.

369
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:37,037
Right?

370
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:43,273
You're not going to tell me
where the diamonds are, are you?

371
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:47,273
- What diamonds?
- Sooner or later you'll have to talk.

372
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:49,351
They'll make you.

373
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:54,070
At the very least,
you'll never get out of town alive.

374
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:57,516
I can solve that little problem.

375
00:40:59,120 --> 00:41:02,715
It's lucky for me that I ran into you.

376
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:06,910
A fifty-fifty split.

377
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,912
You get the diamonds, I get us out.

378
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,035
Us?

379
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:14,192
Well, I can't very well help you
and then stick around.

380
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:17,795
We could be on a plane and
out of the country by tomorrow night.

381
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:21,077
Rio, Hong Kong...

382
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:24,516
- I know a good tailor in Hong Kong.
- Hong Kong.

383
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:29,396
All right. I'll get the diamonds,
you get the plane tickets.

384
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:34,395
No. The airport's too obvious. A rented car
should do us fine for openers.

385
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:36,391
Good thinking.

386
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:40,268
And since you're the one who's
being watched, I'll get the diamonds,

387
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:42,555
you get the car.

388
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:45,518
- That's very good thinking.
- Oh, Peter.

389
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:50,594
I have a feeling this is the beginning
of a wonderful relationship.

390
00:41:58,040 --> 00:42:00,395
- Darling...
- Hm?

391
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:03,517
Where do I pick up the diamonds?

392
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:08,469
Well, when was the last time
you visited a circus?

393
00:42:09,240 --> 00:42:13,995
Circus Circus proudly presents
the Flying Palacios.

394
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:40,635
- She's in the building.
- Right. Stand by.

395
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:44,269
James, next time pick a contact
point when you're standing up.

396
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:46,874
- If she gives your men the slip...
- Relax.

397
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:51,511
I've got upwards of 30 agents down there.
A mouse with sneakers on couldn't get by.

398
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:16,710
Give Maxwell his cue.

399
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:21,032
This is Quarterback.
Operation Passover, commence.

400
00:43:21,120 --> 00:43:24,510
Quarterback to Tight End.
Operation Passover, commence.

401
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:27,237
Roger.

402
00:43:56,680 --> 00:43:59,148
She's on her way. So far, so good.

403
00:43:59,240 --> 00:44:02,232
- Good luck. I'll see you later.
- Where are you going?

404
00:44:02,320 --> 00:44:06,677
The car rental agency.
Our little rendezvous?

405
00:44:06,760 --> 00:44:10,514
You don't think she'll show up, do you?
That's a thousand-to-one shot.

406
00:44:10,600 --> 00:44:16,436
More like even money: Her devotion to
larceny versus my incomparable charm.

407
00:44:23,080 --> 00:44:27,073
<i>(man)</i> All right now, kiddy.
You ready? Aim, fire! Go ahead.

408
00:44:28,280 --> 00:44:32,956
What did I tell you? Didn't I promise you
a winner every time? There you are.

409
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:37,909
All right, boys and girls, here we go again.
All you have to do is just take your gun...

410
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:42,516
All right, now here we have a little lady.
Here we have a little man.

411
00:44:42,600 --> 00:44:46,718
And here we have a big lady. You're
a little out of your league, aren't you?

412
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:49,314
Come on, point the gun.
You know what to do.

413
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:53,632
All ready? Get set. Now hold it till I say go.

414
00:44:53,720 --> 00:44:55,392
Go!

415
00:44:55,480 --> 00:44:58,472
Come on. That's it.
Everybody point right at the clown.

416
00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:00,676
Winner every time. Get 'em up there.

417
00:45:02,360 --> 00:45:05,397
There we are. All right.
That's the way to do it.

418
00:45:07,160 --> 00:45:10,948
Look at that. And we have another winner.

419
00:45:12,200 --> 00:45:14,953
Annie Oakley on the end, huh?

420
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:17,838
Here we are. What an eye, what an eye.

421
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:20,514
Wait a second. Hold it.
I saw the whole thing.

422
00:45:20,600 --> 00:45:23,068
The machine's fixed.
Who's she? Your mother?

423
00:45:23,160 --> 00:45:25,958
Blow up your pants.

424
00:45:26,680 --> 00:45:28,955
<i>(boy)</i> One win! She only had one win.

425
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:31,508
You're supposed to have 24
to win that dog.

426
00:45:31,600 --> 00:45:36,310
Will you give it a rest, kid, huh? Boys and
girls, here we go. Everybody come on.

427
00:45:51,320 --> 00:45:53,356
<i>(trumpets)</i>

428
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:10,199
<i>(PA) Here for the first time, see Zambora,</i>
<i>strangest girl ever born to live.</i>

429
00:46:10,280 --> 00:46:12,874
<i>She was captured</i>
<i>near Nairobi, South Africa,</i>

430
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:16,316
<i>and is believed to be part</i>
<i>of a cruel, inhuman experiment.</i>

431
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:20,791
<i>This beautiful girl will be locked into</i>
<i>a steel cage right in front of your eyes,</i>

432
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:25,670
<i>and will change very slowly</i>
<i>into a ferocious 450-pound gorilla.</i>

433
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:30,678
Please be very still, ladies and gentlemen.
We must have absolute silence,

434
00:46:30,760 --> 00:46:35,470
so we wouldn't disturb Zambora
from her transcendental state.

435
00:46:35,560 --> 00:46:41,510
We must warn you that in every scientific
experiment there's always a danger.

436
00:46:41,600 --> 00:46:44,114
So keep in mind those curtains is an exit.

437
00:46:44,200 --> 00:46:49,228
God forbid something should go wrong
over here, get outta here.

438
00:46:51,080 --> 00:46:54,072
Now we start the transformation.

439
00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:56,833
Very dangerous. Very quiet, please.

446
00:47:43,240 --> 00:47:45,231

- Felix, don't tell me you lost her.
- We lost her.

450
00:48:21,360 --> 00:48:25,069
Nice place you have here.
Take something off, enjoy the sun.

451
00:48:25,160 --> 00:48:29,551
You've got a lot of guts showing up here,
after letting me freeze my behind off

452
00:48:29,640 --> 00:48:33,519
at a blackjack table for two hours
waiting for nonexistent diamonds.

453
00:48:33,600 --> 00:48:37,673
And what the hell is my black wig
doing in the pool?

454
00:48:52,280 --> 00:48:54,157
- She's...
- Dead.

455
00:48:54,240 --> 00:48:58,313
Supposed to be you.
The next link in the pipeline.

456
00:48:58,400 --> 00:49:00,630
What are you talking about?

457
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:04,156
Poor Plenty must have
stumbled in here looking for you.

458
00:49:04,240 --> 00:49:06,754
I don't believe you.

459
00:49:06,840 --> 00:49:10,879
A dentist is dead in South Africa.
That little old lady in Amsterdam.

460
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:15,158
Shady got his last night.
They've missed me once, and you're next.

461
00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:19,275
- Who's your connection?
- You sound like a cop...

462
00:49:19,360 --> 00:49:24,388
- Who's your connection?
- All I know is voices on a phone.

463
00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:27,711
They got me this place
and told me to wait for instructions.

464
00:49:27,800 --> 00:49:31,156
You'd find it hard to hear underwater.
Where's the stuff?

465
00:49:31,240 --> 00:49:35,074
Who are you? You're not a cop
and you're not Peter Franks.

466
00:49:35,160 --> 00:49:38,038
You're not the type
to turn the other cheek. Where is it?

467

- He's Willard Whyte's right-hand man.

Do you see the top? The penthouse?

473
00:50:59,240 --> 00:51:02,869
They say Willard Whyte hasn't
set foot out of there in three years,

474
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:05,235
and no one has seen him. No one.

475
00:51:09,600 --> 00:51:12,160
- How much is that?
- Did you pay for this?

476
00:51:12,600 --> 00:51:14,830
Cut him off.

Where are you going?
Are you mad? Let me by.

Stamps? You ain't got no gas yet. OK?

00:54:32,200 --> 00:54:34,589
How are things in G Section?

493
00:54:35,440 --> 00:54:39,752
Still the same old grind. Checking
radiation shields for replacement.

494
00:54:39,840 --> 00:54:42,673
By the way, where's yours?

495
00:54:42,760 --> 00:54:46,275
I've been waiting a couple of days
for you guys to deliver them.

496
00:54:46,360 --> 00:54:49,955
Gee, I'm sorry.
You should have given us a phone call.

497
00:54:50,040 --> 00:54:53,874
I've got one here.
Lucky for you, I carry spares.

498
00:54:53,960 --> 00:54:57,191
You keep that on.
You can't be too careful about radiation.

499
00:54:57,280 --> 00:55:01,751
- Absolutely. I feel much safer with this on.
- See you around.

500
00:55:26,120 --> 00:55:28,350
Who are you? What do you want?

501
00:55:28,440 --> 00:55:32,752
Klaus Hergersheimer. G Section.
Just checking on radiation shields.

502
00:55:32,840 --> 00:55:36,628
- Now, let me see. You are...?
- Professor Dr Metz.

503
00:55:36,720 --> 00:55:39,154
Our shields are fine. Now get out.

504
00:55:39,240 --> 00:55:43,950
I'm sorry.
It won't take a moment, but I must verify.

505
00:55:44,040 --> 00:55:47,476
Metz. How do you spell it?

506
00:55:47,560 --> 00:55:50,677
Will you please leave, you irritating man?

507
00:55:50,760 --> 00:55:54,070
Doctor, there's no reason
to run down the little people.

508
00:55:54,160 --> 00:55:58,438
G Section may not be as important
as you are, but we do have our orders.

509
00:55:58,520 --> 00:56:01,159
- Dr Metz, Willard Whyte for you.
- Right.

510
00:56:01,240 --> 00:56:03,231
Out, out.

511
00:56:06,880 --> 00:56:08,677
Hello, WW.

512
00:56:08,760 --> 00:56:11,957
Yes, it's finally here.

513
00:56:12,040 --> 00:56:14,429
Quite enough for completion.

514
00:56:16,280 --> 00:56:20,512
We'll be through shortly.
No. No problems at all.

515
00:56:27,880 --> 00:56:30,633
- Now will you get out of here?
- Certainly, Doctor.

516
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:33,757
I've seen everything I need to see.

517
00:56:33,840 --> 00:56:36,115
Thank you very much.

518
00:56:38,840 --> 00:56:41,752
Hi. Sorry to bother you.
I'm Klaus Hergersheimer.

519
00:56:42,520 --> 00:56:44,988
G Section.

520
00:56:47,240 --> 00:56:49,435
Checking radiation shields?

521
00:57:01,080 --> 00:57:03,036
<i>(alarm)</i>

522
00:57:03,960 --> 00:57:06,235
There he is, behind the rock. Come on!

523
00:57:08,880 --> 00:57:13,351
<i>(PA) What the hell is this?</i>
<i>Amateur night? Stop him, Harry.</i>

524
00:57:18,080 --> 00:57:21,789
<i>Get him off that machine. That isn't a toy.</i>
<i>Get out of that moon buggy!</i>

525
00:57:49,760 --> 00:57:52,149
It's gone berserk.

526
00:57:53,480 --> 00:57:56,472
- Stop.
- What do you think you're doing? Hey!

527
00:59:32,720 --> 00:59:34,711
That way.

528
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:32,991
- What happened?
- Get in.

529
01:00:33,080 --> 01:00:36,868
If you see a mad professor
in a minibus, just smile.

530
01:00:53,680 --> 01:00:56,797
Fred, get the sheriff's office.

531
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:09,312
You can drop me off at the next corner.
This whole thing is getting out of hand.

532
01:01:09,400 --> 01:01:13,916
No regrets, but when you steal moon
machines from Willard Whyte, goodbye.

533
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:17,549
Just relax. I have a friend named Felix
who can fix anything.

534
01:01:17,640 --> 01:01:20,154
Is he married?

535
01:01:22,680 --> 01:01:25,319
There goes that son-of-a-bitchin' saboteur.

536
01:01:25,400 --> 01:01:27,391
<i>(siren)</i>

537
01:01:36,320 --> 01:01:39,710
Relax. You've got a friend
named Felix who can fix anything.

538
01:01:39,800 --> 01:01:41,950
Unfortunately, so can Willard Whyte.

539
01:01:48,200 --> 01:01:50,395
Why, you dirty...

540
01:01:52,480 --> 01:01:53,629
<i>(siren)</i>

541
01:04:04,600 --> 01:04:06,670
Come in, Larry. Larry?

542
01:04:07,360 --> 01:04:08,952
<i>Larry?</i>

543
01:04:09,040 --> 01:04:11,031
<i>Go get him, Larry.</i>

544
01:04:13,280 --> 01:04:15,635
- I think Larry got him.
- Sheriff...

545
01:04:15,720 --> 01:04:18,234
Attaboy, Larry. Come in. Larry?

546
01:04:18,320 --> 01:04:19,912
Sheriff...

547
01:04:25,720 --> 01:04:27,711
<i>(siren)</i>

548
01:04:35,200 --> 01:04:37,555
I got you now.

549
01:04:39,720 --> 01:04:41,119
Lean over.

550
01:05:14,400 --> 01:05:19,315
<i>(Tiffany)</i> Why are we suddenly staying
in the bridal suite of the Whyte House?

551
01:05:19,400 --> 01:05:23,279
In order to form
a more perfect union, sweetheart.

552
01:05:23,360 --> 01:05:25,032
James...

553
01:05:25,120 --> 01:05:27,759
May I finally call you James?

554
01:05:30,920 --> 01:05:33,912
What's going to happen to me?

555
01:05:35,520 --> 01:05:37,988
You did talk to your friend Felix
about me?

556
01:05:38,080 --> 01:05:41,117
- Uh-huh.
- Well, what did he say?

557
01:05:41,200 --> 01:05:44,510
Something about 20 years to life.
Nothing important.

558
01:05:44,600 --> 01:05:49,720
- 20 years to life?
- Relax, I'm on top of the situation.

559
01:05:59,720 --> 01:06:01,438
Mr and Mrs Jones?

560
01:06:01,520 --> 01:06:05,752
Yes. That's the name on the register,
Mr Leiter. What's the score with WW?

561
01:06:05,840 --> 01:06:08,912
- Washington says no go. We sit still.
- Sit still?

562
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:13,790
And Miss Tiffany Case "Jones" has
a lifetime reservation at another hotel.

563
01:06:13,880 --> 01:06:16,553
The kind the government... runs.

564
01:06:16,640 --> 01:06:20,553
I'm cooperating, Mr Leiter. Really I am.

565
01:06:20,640 --> 01:06:22,870
I can vouch for that.

566
01:06:22,960 --> 01:06:26,430
This is not the real White House
and he's not the president.

567
01:06:26,520 --> 01:06:29,751
- Why don't we just see him?
- The president I can get you in to see.

568
01:06:29,840 --> 01:06:33,389
But until Washington believes
Whyte's a thief, that's the way it is.

569
01:06:33,480 --> 01:06:37,837
In the mean time, I'm sure
you and Mrs Jones can amuse yourselves.

570
01:06:37,920 --> 01:06:41,879
And just to make sure you're not
disturbed, I have a man upstairs.

571
01:06:41,960 --> 01:06:45,509
And Hamilton is right out here.

572
01:06:45,600 --> 01:06:47,591
So long, James.

573
01:06:47,680 --> 01:06:50,069
- Well, that's a switch.
- What's that?

574
01:06:50,160 --> 01:06:53,391
The wolf being guarded
by the three little pigs.

575
01:06:54,920 --> 01:06:57,309
I won't be long, darling.

576
01:06:57,400 --> 01:06:59,789
Where are you going?

577
01:06:59,880 --> 01:07:03,270
I'm just popping upstairs for a moment.

578
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:14,790
- Sixteenth floor?
- <i>(man)</i> No, lady. Starlight Lounge only.

579
01:07:14,880 --> 01:07:18,270
OK, folks, stand clear of the doors.
Here we go.

580
01:07:55,560 --> 01:07:59,997
<i>(man)</i> Starlight Lounge to the left.
Express to street level only, folks.

581
01:08:00,080 --> 01:08:03,914
OK. Stand clear of the doors. Here we go.

582
01:10:29,640 --> 01:10:32,552
<i>(Whyte) Howdy. Welcome.</i>
<i>We've been expectin' you.</i>

583
01:10:32,640 --> 01:10:36,474
<i>You got any personal business</i>
<i>to take care of in there, go right ahead.</i>

584
01:10:36,560 --> 01:10:42,032
<i>I suspect you're wearin' a hogleg. Would</i>
<i>you mind standin' up and takin' it off?</i>

585
01:10:45,240 --> 01:10:49,677
<i>Oh, isn't that nice?</i>
<i>You are a pleasant fella.</i>

586
01:10:50,800 --> 01:10:55,112
<i>Why don't you just come on in, son?</i>
<i>Relax, make yourself comfortable.</i>

587
01:10:55,200 --> 01:10:58,192
<i>That's good. Right on over there.</i>

588
01:11:17,800 --> 01:11:20,997
- Good evening, Mr Bond.
- Blofeld.

589
01:11:23,440 --> 01:11:25,237
Good evening, 007.

590
01:11:28,800 --> 01:11:33,157
Double jeopardy, Mr Bond. You killed
my only other double, I'm afraid.

591
01:11:33,240 --> 01:11:38,439
After his death, volunteers were
understandably rather scarce.

592
01:11:38,920 --> 01:11:41,229
Such a pity. All that time and expense,

593
01:11:41,320 --> 01:11:44,517
simply to provide you
with one mock-heroic moment.

594
01:11:44,600 --> 01:11:46,670
<i>(phone rings)</i>

595
01:11:51,600 --> 01:11:54,160
<i>(Southern accent)</i> Willard Whyte speakin'.

596
01:11:54,240 --> 01:11:56,390
Yes, Governor, I got your message.

597
01:11:56,480 --> 01:12:00,553
No, I'm afraid a personal appearance
is quite out of the question.

598
01:12:00,640 --> 01:12:04,997
I'll send a deposition to the committee.
Thank you, Governor.

599
01:12:07,360 --> 01:12:11,114
- That's a neat trick.
- A voice box, Mr Bond.

600
01:12:11,200 --> 01:12:15,159
Science was never my strong suit,
but the principle is easy enough.

601
01:12:15,240 --> 01:12:20,837
Someone's voice patterns and resonance
stored in a small oral-signature tape.

602
01:12:20,920 --> 01:12:24,879
And a miniature, transistorised version
is installed in his neck.

603
01:12:24,960 --> 01:12:27,110
Or is it his neck? I never can remember.

604
01:12:27,200 --> 01:12:29,953
Anyway, no matter. We both sound alike.

605
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:34,594
My congratulations to you both.

606
01:12:38,120 --> 01:12:41,032
Nice little company.

607
01:12:41,120 --> 01:12:45,113
Explosives, oil, electronics,
houses, aviation.

608
01:12:45,200 --> 01:12:48,237
I've done well with it.
Tried to cut some of the fat off.

609
01:12:48,320 --> 01:12:52,393
Actually, Mr Whyte's
a splendid administrator. <i>(laughs)</i>

610
01:12:52,480 --> 01:12:55,233
- Damn thing runs itself.
- I suppose you killed him.

611
01:12:55,320 --> 01:12:59,836
Nothing so melodramatic. I'm simply
holding him in cold storage, so to speak.

612
01:12:59,920 --> 01:13:03,879
An insurance policy against
any outside interference with my plans.

613
01:13:03,960 --> 01:13:08,033
Hm. The ideal kidnap victim.
No one's seen the man for five years.

614
01:13:08,120 --> 01:13:12,398
- So who'd miss someone who's missing?
- How clever you are, Mr Bond.

615
01:13:12,480 --> 01:13:16,917
Nice to see you haven't lost
that fine mental edge, 007.

616
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:21,949
Please don't get any foolish notions.
That missile is not a practical weapon.

617
01:13:23,840 --> 01:13:26,912
It's hardly worth the effort.

618
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:30,037
After all, I wouldn't know
which one of you to kill.

619
01:13:30,120 --> 01:13:32,680
We appreciate
your predicament, Mr Bond.

620
01:13:32,760 --> 01:13:34,671
We deeply sympathise.

621
01:13:41,200 --> 01:13:43,316
<i>(gun is cocked)</i>

622
01:13:52,920 --> 01:13:55,593
Right idea, Mr Bond.

623
01:13:55,680 --> 01:13:57,830
But wrong pussy.

624
01:13:57,920 --> 01:14:02,038
I do so enjoy our little visits, Mr Bond.

625
01:14:02,120 --> 01:14:07,274
However potentially painful they may be.
I'm afraid this one has come to an end.

626
01:14:07,360 --> 01:14:10,557
What do you intend to do
with those diamonds?

627
01:14:10,640 --> 01:14:12,756
An excellent question.

628
01:14:12,840 --> 01:14:16,628
And one which will be hanging
on the lips of the world quite soon.

629
01:14:16,720 --> 01:14:20,508
If I were to break the news to anyone,
it would be to you first, Mr Bond.

630
01:14:20,600 --> 01:14:25,469
But it's late, I'm tired,
and there's so much left to do.

631
01:14:28,040 --> 01:14:30,031
Good night, Mr Bond.

632
01:14:37,280 --> 01:14:40,033
Well, go on, go on. It's merely a lift.

633
01:14:40,640 --> 01:14:43,677
Or perhaps I should say "elevator".

634
01:14:44,680 --> 01:14:50,471
You'll find it much more convenient than
mountaineering outside the Whyte House.

635
01:14:51,480 --> 01:14:55,792
You press L, Mr Bond.
The word "lobby" begins with L.

636
01:15:07,920 --> 01:15:09,717

If at first you don't succeed, Mr Kidd...

639

Try, try again, Mr Wint.

Sorry about that, old boy.

All right, Charlie,
it's your turn to play hunchback.

01:20:09,760 --> 01:20:12,638
- That's impossible.
- <i>Yeah? Have a look for yourself.</i>

657
01:20:12,720 --> 01:20:17,714
Hey, listen, if he's half the genius
they say he is, we're in for real trouble.

658
01:20:17,800 --> 01:20:21,315
- <i>Now calm down, Bert.</i>
- It's a cinch he's not working alone.

659
01:20:21,400 --> 01:20:25,951
This place must be crawling with agents.
I think we should move Willard Whyte.

660
01:20:26,040 --> 01:20:29,476
<i>Nonsense. Mr Whyte is perfectly safe</i>
<i>at his own summerhouse.</i>

661
01:20:29,560 --> 01:20:32,154
It's on the ridge,
about ten miles out of town.

662
01:20:32,240 --> 01:20:35,710
<i>I'm a little surprised, Bert.</i>
<i>It's not like you to panic.</i>

663
01:20:35,800 --> 01:20:39,190
I don't enjoy messing around
with a guy as tough as James Bond.

664
01:20:39,280 --> 01:20:43,193
Never mind James Bond.
You get down to that house.

665
01:20:43,280 --> 01:20:47,319
I'm afraid Mr Whyte has suddenly
outgrown his usefulness. Do it cleanly.

666
01:20:47,400 --> 01:20:51,393
<i>(as Bert)</i> Don't worry.
Just leave everything to me.

667
01:20:52,400 --> 01:20:56,359
<i>(as Bond)</i> That ridiculous contraption
actually seems to work, Q.

668
01:20:56,440 --> 01:20:59,113
- You've surpassed yourself.
- Not a bit of it.

669
01:20:59,200 --> 01:21:01,919
Made one of these
for the kids last Christmas.

670
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:07,199
James and I are heading for the house. Hit
the penthouse as soon as we find Whyte.

671
01:21:07,280 --> 01:21:09,271
<i>(Blofeld)</i> Let me speak to Metz.

672
01:21:09,760 --> 01:21:15,278
There's a change. Push all plans forward
by 24 hours. I'm joining you immediately.

673
01:21:21,760 --> 01:21:25,673
Give me five minutes to get up there
and five minutes to find Whyte.

674
01:21:26,400 --> 01:21:29,437
Are you sure you know
what you're doing?

675
01:21:29,520 --> 01:21:32,512
Ask me again in ten minutes' time.

676
01:21:34,280 --> 01:21:37,272
Tell Maxwell to stand by
to hit the penthouse.

677
01:22:27,520 --> 01:22:30,239
Well, hi there.

678
01:22:34,200 --> 01:22:35,792
I'm Bambi.

679
01:22:37,400 --> 01:22:39,709
Good morning, Bambi.

680
01:22:39,800 --> 01:22:44,510
And I'm Thumper.
Is there something we can do for you?

681
01:22:44,600 --> 01:22:47,672
I can think of several things offhand,

682
01:22:47,760 --> 01:22:50,513
but at the moment
I'm looking for Willard Whyte.

683
01:22:50,600 --> 01:22:54,195
Oh, Willie. Why, he's right out there.

684
01:22:56,240 --> 01:23:00,313
And that's all there is to it?

685
01:23:00,400 --> 01:23:02,595
Not quite.

686
01:23:02,680 --> 01:23:06,468
First we're gonna have a ball.

687
01:23:11,240 --> 01:23:13,595
All yours, Bambi.

688
01:23:28,960 --> 01:23:30,791
You're on again, Bambi.

689
01:23:36,040 --> 01:23:37,837
Thumper.

690
01:24:17,960 --> 01:24:19,951
<i>(both)</i> Yah!

691
01:25:00,080 --> 01:25:01,593
Hello, Felix.

692
01:25:01,680 --> 01:25:04,911
Wouldn't you know it?
Willard Whyte is about to be executed,

693
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:08,629
and guess who's giving
breaststroke lessons.

694
01:25:08,720 --> 01:25:12,998
- Where the hell is Whyte?
- I haven't found out yet.

695
01:25:13,080 --> 01:25:15,071
<i>(both gasp)</i>

696
01:25:16,560 --> 01:25:19,279
Still haven't found out.

697
01:25:25,440 --> 01:25:27,431
Right.

698
01:25:51,240 --> 01:25:53,993
FBI? CIA?

699
01:25:54,080 --> 01:25:57,470
No. British Intelligence, Mr Whyte.
James Bond.

700
01:26:00,320 --> 01:26:03,153
I see you've met my friends
Bambi and Thumper.

701
01:26:03,240 --> 01:26:05,959
Yes, we did have a bit of a chat.

702
01:26:06,040 --> 01:26:09,237
What the hell's happened to me
and what can I do about it?

703
01:26:09,320 --> 01:26:13,233
Let's get out of here first
and I'll explain it to you en route.

704
01:26:14,040 --> 01:26:16,634
- Tell Maxwell to hit the penthouse...
- <i>(gunshot)</i>

705
01:26:17,680 --> 01:26:19,671
<i>(machine-gun fire)</i>

706
01:26:24,600 --> 01:26:26,955
Argh!

707
01:26:30,440 --> 01:26:32,635
Saxby.

708
01:26:32,720 --> 01:26:35,871
- Bert Saxby?
- Yeah.

709
01:26:35,960 --> 01:26:39,191
Tell him he's fired.

710
01:26:52,840 --> 01:26:55,115
Hi there, Mr Q. Are you having any luck?

711
01:26:55,200 --> 01:27:00,399
- I'm being somewhat successful, thanks.
- Listen, Mr Q, I was wondering.

712
01:27:00,480 --> 01:27:04,712
Have you heard any talk
about me from Felix or James?

713
01:27:04,800 --> 01:27:06,791
No, I'm afraid not.

714
01:27:06,880 --> 01:27:12,034
I guess I'm working for the good guys
now, but I'm still two steps away from jail.

715
01:27:12,120 --> 01:27:16,238
I thought you might be able
to put in a good word.

716
01:27:24,920 --> 01:27:27,434
That's unbelievable.

717
01:27:28,080 --> 01:27:33,837
An electromagnetic RPM controller.
Been aching to give it a try.

718
01:27:33,920 --> 01:27:37,754
You see, pressure on the case here
when the desired symbols appear,

719
01:27:37,840 --> 01:27:44,439
this causes the rotation of the cylinders to
stutter at the precise moment needed to...

720
01:27:52,800 --> 01:27:55,109
Cab, lady?

721
01:28:02,360 --> 01:28:05,511
Well, well, well.
Look what the cat dragged in.

722
01:28:05,600 --> 01:28:07,795
I'm delighted to meet you, Miss Case.

723
01:28:07,880 --> 01:28:11,668
I'd so dreaded the prospect of
making this tedious journey alone.

724
01:28:24,240 --> 01:28:28,631
It was right here.
About six feet high, with a solar panel.

725
01:28:28,720 --> 01:28:32,508
- It had these aerofoils that seemed to...
- Draw it for me.

726
01:28:32,600 --> 01:28:35,114
Was Dr Metz on your payroll, Mr Whyte?

727
01:28:35,200 --> 01:28:38,078
No, but I heard of him.
Everybody in our business has.

728
01:28:38,160 --> 01:28:41,197
The world's leading expert
on laser refraction.

729
01:28:41,280 --> 01:28:43,874
A committed idealist to peace.

730
01:28:43,960 --> 01:28:48,590
And how in the hell Blofeld got
his hooks in him, I will never know.

731
01:28:48,680 --> 01:28:51,194
How did he get security clearance
to work here?

732
01:28:51,280 --> 01:28:54,636
From you, sir.
I talked to you personally about it.

733
01:28:54,720 --> 01:28:57,029
I even recognised your voice just now.

734
01:28:57,120 --> 01:29:02,831
I'm sure I told you not to keep the usual
duplicate microfilm records of the project.

735
01:29:02,920 --> 01:29:05,070
Exactly.

736
01:29:05,160 --> 01:29:08,596
Tom, what did <i>I tell you to do with this?

737
01:29:08,680 --> 01:29:10,910
Send it to Vandenberg.

738
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:14,117
Well, get 'em on the phone, now.

739
01:29:17,840 --> 01:29:19,637
<i>(phone rings)</i>

740
01:29:19,720 --> 01:29:21,517
Yeah?

741
01:29:21,600 --> 01:29:24,512
You won't believe this.
Willard Whyte for you.

742
01:29:24,600 --> 01:29:27,114
Wow.
This is a real honour, sir.

743
01:29:27,200 --> 01:29:30,033
Shove it. Where's that satellite
I sent down there?

744
01:29:30,120 --> 01:29:32,111
Blasted off 24 minutes ago, sir.

745
01:29:36,120 --> 01:29:40,591
Perfect trajectory. All systems go.
We expect to enter orbit right on the nose.

746
01:29:46,880 --> 01:29:50,555
- Wait. Something's happened.
- Just a moment, Mr Whyte.

747
01:29:50,640 --> 01:29:52,835
The scanners have gone crazy.

748
01:29:52,920 --> 01:29:55,639
- Premature separation.
- It doesn't make sense.

749
01:30:07,360 --> 01:30:09,749
Stand by to abort.

750
01:30:12,840 --> 01:30:15,274
- We can't control it, sir.
- Abort it.

751
01:30:16,320 --> 01:30:18,072
- It's negative.
- We can't.

752
01:30:18,160 --> 01:30:21,152
Something's taken over
the guidance systems.

753
01:30:21,240 --> 01:30:26,189
- It's as if it had a will of its own.
- And there's not a damn thing we can do.

754
01:30:26,280 --> 01:30:28,475
We're working on it. I'll call you back.

755
01:30:31,440 --> 01:30:35,592
Well, whatever it is,
your friend Blofeld's controllin' it now.

756
01:30:41,800 --> 01:30:45,839
A vast supply of diamonds manipulated
by an expert in light refraction.

757
01:30:45,920 --> 01:30:48,309
The first beam was generated
through a diamond,

758
01:30:48,400 --> 01:30:54,509
and if Metz deserves his reputation, the
power of that thing could be incredible.

759
01:30:54,600 --> 01:30:56,591
And Blofeld's got it.

760
01:30:59,560 --> 01:31:02,757
- Where is it now?
- <i>(man) Approaching North Dakota.</i>

761
01:31:02,840 --> 01:31:06,594
- Alert Strategic Air Command.
- Give me an open line to SAC.

762
01:31:07,920 --> 01:31:11,799
<i>(PA) Attention all personnel.</i>
<i>Attention all personnel.</i>

763
01:31:11,880 --> 01:31:16,476
<i>We have a red alert.</i>
<i>Stand by for emergency procedure.</i>

764
01:31:31,320 --> 01:31:33,311
<i>(phone rings)</i>

765
01:31:34,440 --> 01:31:36,431
Willard Whyte.

766
01:31:40,280 --> 01:31:42,271
Yes, General.

767
01:31:45,160 --> 01:31:50,996
One of our missiles just accidentally
blew up in North Dakota.

768
01:31:51,080 --> 01:31:53,833
Whatever's happenin',
Mr Bond, has started.

769
01:32:13,840 --> 01:32:17,913
- Is this your herd?
- Mr Whyte, phone call from Washington.

770
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:20,992
- I'll catch it in the john.
- What about Blofeld?

771
01:32:21,080 --> 01:32:24,072
- Not a trace, but we found a tunnel.
- Where's Tiffany?

772
01:32:24,160 --> 01:32:28,950
Do you mind if we find Blofeld first?
Come on, let's hit that tunnel.

773
01:32:45,200 --> 01:32:47,191
Argh!

774
01:32:54,960 --> 01:32:58,999
Well, Washington just got word
from your friend with the cat.

775
01:32:59,080 --> 01:33:02,868
Would you believe that this whole
country is bein' held for ransom

776
01:33:02,960 --> 01:33:05,838
and we've got
till noon tomorrow to pay up?

777
01:33:05,920 --> 01:33:09,913
So that's it, then.
Well, I'm sure you won't be alone.

778
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:15,996
An international auction, with nuclear
supremacy goin' to the highest bidder.

779
01:33:17,400 --> 01:33:20,597
Tell me, what does he need
to control that satellite?

780
01:33:20,680 --> 01:33:25,196
A simple set of tapes fed into a computer
bank. All he really needs is a building.

781
01:33:25,280 --> 01:33:29,159
And these tapes? Large or small?

782
01:33:29,240 --> 01:33:34,951
Conceivably any size,
from six inches to a cassette.

783
01:33:35,040 --> 01:33:38,032
Assuming he's still using
your empire as a cover,

784
01:33:38,120 --> 01:33:40,395
Blofeld could be anywhere on this map.

785
01:33:40,480 --> 01:33:44,314
From Alaska to Florida,
from Maine to Oregon.

786
01:33:44,400 --> 01:33:47,472
From Texas to Baja California.

787
01:33:49,520 --> 01:33:51,511
Baja?

788
01:33:52,200 --> 01:33:55,317
I haven't got anything at Baja.

789
01:34:01,040 --> 01:34:05,636
<i>(radio) There is still no official explanation</i>
<i>of the simultaneous nuclear accidents</i>

790
01:34:05,720 --> 01:34:07,358
<i>in North Dakota and Russia.</i>

791
01:34:07,440 --> 01:34:11,558
<i>Presidential news secretary John Fenner</i>

<i>Reports of another nuclear accident</i>
<i>in Red China are as yet unconfirmed...</i>

796
01:34:28,280 --> 01:34:30,919
Two more submarines
have taken up position.

797
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:33,560
Will those military aircraft
stand off forever?

798
01:34:33,640 --> 01:34:37,349
What if they won't accept our ultimatum?
What if they decide to attack?

799
01:34:37,440 --> 01:34:42,195
Calm yourself, Metz. This farcical show
of force was only to be expected.

800
01:34:42,280 --> 01:34:46,990
The Great Powers flexing their muscles
like so many impotent beach boys.

801
01:34:47,080 --> 01:34:51,551
I regret my threat to destroy a major city
unless they give in, but there it is,

802
01:34:51,640 --> 01:34:55,838
the nuclear powers, like all bullies,
can only be intimidated by force.

803
01:34:55,920 --> 01:34:59,071
- But how can...
- There's still an hour left to reply.

804
01:34:59,160 --> 01:35:02,152
One hour for both of us
to achieve our common dream:

805
01:35:02,240 --> 01:35:06,313
Total disarmament
and peace for the world.

806
01:35:08,120 --> 01:35:11,237
- Sir, there's a single plane approaching.
- Range?

807
01:35:11,320 --> 01:35:13,311
Two miles, and closing.

We're cleaning up the world and
thought this was a suitable starting point.

817
01:37:01,280 --> 01:37:05,512
How disappointing. I was expecting
one head of state, at the very least.

818
01:37:05,600 --> 01:37:07,636
Surely you haven't come to negotiate?

819
01:37:07,720 --> 01:37:11,713
Your pitiful little island
hasn't even been threatened.

820
01:37:11,800 --> 01:37:16,794
Search him from his toenails to the last
follicle on his head, then bring him to me.

821
01:37:29,680 --> 01:37:33,468
<i>(~ "The British Grenadiers"</i>
<i>played by military band)</i>

822
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:42,992
I do so hate martial music.

823
01:37:44,480 --> 01:37:47,631
But as usual, Mr Bond,
you were absolutely right.

824
01:37:47,720 --> 01:37:52,157
You guessed correctly, that box contained
the master satellite control tape,

825
01:37:52,240 --> 01:37:58,076
and you came aboard presumably
hoping to substitute this for the real thing.

826
01:38:00,600 --> 01:38:04,513
So sorry to have ruined
the line of your suit for nothing.

827
01:38:06,200 --> 01:38:08,555
Which line did you use on Miss Case?

828
01:38:08,640 --> 01:38:12,076
Miss Case has taken
a reasonable attitude about all this.

829
01:38:12,160 --> 01:38:16,950
Like any sensible animal, she's only
threatening when she's threatened.

830
01:38:17,040 --> 01:38:20,999
It appears that you're holding all the aces,
down to the dragon lady here.

831
01:38:21,080 --> 01:38:25,596
Jealousy? From you, Mr Bond?
I'm flattered.

832
01:38:25,680 --> 01:38:31,357
As La Rochefoucauld observed,
"Humility is the worst form of conceit."

833
01:38:31,440 --> 01:38:33,749
I do hold the winning hand.

834
01:38:33,840 --> 01:38:38,391
Why don't you let me take you
on a little tour of our facilities?

835
01:38:38,480 --> 01:38:42,359
Your chance to see
the real tape once again.

836
01:38:42,440 --> 01:38:45,352
Can I tag along, Ernst?

837
01:38:45,440 --> 01:38:49,274
I'd put something on
over that bikini first, my dear.

838
01:38:49,360 --> 01:38:54,195
I've come too far to have the aim of my
crew affected by the sight of your body.

839
01:38:54,280 --> 01:38:57,431
No word yet from anyone.

840
01:38:57,520 --> 01:38:59,909
Only 12 minutes left.

841
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:04,357
Oh, well, I suppose
a little gentle prodding is called for.

842
01:39:04,440 --> 01:39:08,672
As you see, Mr Bond,
the satellite is at present over...

843
01:39:09,640 --> 01:39:10,959
Kansas.

844
01:39:12,360 --> 01:39:16,114
But if we destroy Kansas,
the world may not hear about it for years.

845
01:39:16,200 --> 01:39:18,953
Perhaps New York.
All that smut and traffic.

846
01:39:19,040 --> 01:39:21,793
It would give them a chance
for a fresh start.

847
01:39:21,880 --> 01:39:24,155
Washington, DC. Perfect.

848
01:39:24,240 --> 01:39:27,516
Since we have not heard from them,
they will hear from us.

849
01:39:27,600 --> 01:39:31,479
- See to it, Metz.
- Washington. Right.

850
01:39:31,560 --> 01:39:36,076
And this, presumably,
is the control bank with the coded tape.

851
01:39:36,160 --> 01:39:40,711
Right again, Mr Bond. All satellites
are controlled by a coded tape.

852
01:39:40,800 --> 01:39:43,189
The trick is, of course, to have the code.

853
01:39:43,280 --> 01:39:45,748
Obviously.
It all seems so perfectly simple.

854
01:39:45,840 --> 01:39:49,879
I suppose one just presses that
and out it pops.

855
01:39:53,960 --> 01:39:57,396
Put it back, Mr Bond. Immediately.

856
01:40:03,520 --> 01:40:05,317
Hi, Ernst.

857
01:40:05,400 --> 01:40:09,678
- Is Superman giving you any trouble?
- Put it back very carefully.

858
01:40:14,960 --> 01:40:17,394
You've suddenly
become tiresome, Mr Bond.

859
01:40:17,480 --> 01:40:20,153
Target fixed. Commence countdown.

860
01:40:20,240 --> 01:40:22,708
Ten minutes and counting.

861
01:40:22,800 --> 01:40:28,397
Take him away and throw him in the brig.
And search him again, just to make sure.

862
01:40:36,040 --> 01:40:38,156
Bitch.

863
01:40:41,240 --> 01:40:44,277
Your problems are all behind you now.

864
01:41:13,320 --> 01:41:15,311
Stop him!

865
01:41:18,280 --> 01:41:21,033
<i>(PA) Nine minutes and counting.</i>

866
01:41:26,240 --> 01:41:28,834
I did it. I switched the tape in the machine.

867
01:41:28,920 --> 01:41:32,913
- You twit. You put the real one back in.
- Come on, let's go.

868
01:41:53,560 --> 01:41:56,393
<i>(spotter)</i> A weather balloon.

869
01:41:56,840 --> 01:41:59,400
- What do you think?
- That must be the signal.

870
01:41:59,480 --> 01:42:03,951
There isn't a low-pressure area
within 200 miles of here. Let's go.

871
01:42:05,800 --> 01:42:09,395
<i>This is Charlie One to Squadron.</i>
<i>Charlie One to Squadron.</i>

872
01:42:09,480 --> 01:42:14,156
<i>Ready all guns and proceed to target.</i>
<i>I repeat: Proceed to target.</i>

873
01:42:14,240 --> 01:42:16,800
<i>(pilot) Roger, Charlie One. Out.</i>

874
01:42:16,880 --> 01:42:19,952
Come on, Bond.
Get the hell off that rig.

875
01:42:20,040 --> 01:42:22,474
<i>(PA) Eight minutes and counting.</i>

876
01:42:26,200 --> 01:42:30,398
Unidentified aircraft approaching rapidly.
Range five miles.

877
01:42:30,480 --> 01:42:34,632
But I don't understand.
You said they wouldn't attack. You said...

878
01:42:34,720 --> 01:42:39,919
The balloon was a signal. The fools must
think Mr Bond accomplished his mission.

879
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:42,468
- Activate defences.
- Activate defences.

880
01:42:44,760 --> 01:42:46,751
<i>(klaxon)</i>

881
01:42:54,200 --> 01:42:56,873
<i>Seven minutes and counting.</i>

882
01:43:07,360 --> 01:43:11,069
This is Charlie One. Commence attack.

883
01:43:11,160 --> 01:43:13,674
<i>Commence attack.</i>

884
01:43:44,360 --> 01:43:46,715
Six minutes and counting.

885
01:43:46,800 --> 01:43:49,837
Get them on the radio, Blofeld.
Tell them we give up.

886
01:43:49,920 --> 01:43:53,390
Give up?
I've waited too long for this moment.

887
01:43:53,480 --> 01:43:56,438
They'll pay dearly
for making a fool out of me.

888
01:43:56,520 --> 01:43:59,318
I see it all now.
You don't give a damn about peace.

889
01:43:59,400 --> 01:44:02,198
- All you care about...
- Shut up, Metz.

890
01:44:04,080 --> 01:44:06,594
Tiffany, my dear.

891
01:44:06,680 --> 01:44:10,070
We're showing a bit more cheek
than usual, aren't we?

892
01:44:15,960 --> 01:44:19,430
Take her below and
lock her up with Mr Bond.

893
01:44:19,520 --> 01:44:22,956
What a pity. Such nice cheeks, too.

894
01:44:23,040 --> 01:44:26,715
If only they were brains.
Destroy this, Metz.

895
01:44:41,840 --> 01:44:44,638
<i>Five minutes and counting.</i>

896
01:45:35,760 --> 01:45:38,479
<i>Four minutes and counting.</i>

897
01:45:58,080 --> 01:46:00,753
Tell them we surrender.
This is utter madness.

898
01:46:00,840 --> 01:46:05,311
One more word, Metz, and I'll have you
shot. Get back to your post.

899
01:46:09,000 --> 01:46:11,992
Prepare my bathosub immediately.

900
01:46:20,280 --> 01:46:22,271
<i>Three minutes and counting.</i>

901
01:46:38,480 --> 01:46:40,277
All systems interlock.

902
01:46:40,360 --> 01:46:42,828
<i>Bathosub to crane: Commence lift.</i>

903
01:46:58,400 --> 01:47:00,356
<i>Two minutes and counting.</i>

904
01:47:12,400 --> 01:47:15,949
Power and breathing systems on.
Release catch is open.

905
01:47:18,360 --> 01:47:20,555
Lower away.

906
01:47:21,760 --> 01:47:24,672
<i>Bathosub to crane: Lower away.</i>

907
01:47:26,000 --> 01:47:27,956
Wake up, man. Lower away.

908
01:47:34,760 --> 01:47:37,228
You stupid idiot! You could've killed me.

909
01:47:37,320 --> 01:47:39,151
<i>Disengage.</i>

910
01:47:39,360 --> 01:47:41,157
<i>Disengage.</i>

911
01:47:46,640 --> 01:47:48,039
<i>Disengage!</i>

912
01:47:48,120 --> 01:47:50,793
Lower. Not up.

913
01:47:54,640 --> 01:47:56,870
One minute and counting.

914
01:47:59,040 --> 01:48:03,192
<i>Blofeld to Command Centre: Come in.</i>

915
01:48:03,400 --> 01:48:07,313
<i>Blofeld to Command Centre: Come in.</i>

916
01:48:15,240 --> 01:48:18,630
Damn you! Damn you.
Command Centre, come in.

917
01:48:22,160 --> 01:48:25,072
<i>40 seconds and counting.</i>

918
01:48:31,120 --> 01:48:33,315
Get the gun.

919
01:48:35,880 --> 01:48:37,950
- Here.
- Shoot 'em.

920
01:48:45,640 --> 01:48:47,153
Argh!

921
01:48:52,800 --> 01:48:54,279
Jump!

922
01:48:55,880 --> 01:48:58,075
<i>Ten, nine...</i>

923
01:49:41,920 --> 01:49:45,629
So long, James.
I'll wire M you're on your way home.

924
01:49:45,720 --> 01:49:48,359
Don't tell him which direction we've taken.

925
01:49:48,440 --> 01:49:50,271
If you're havin' a good time,

926
01:49:50,360 --> 01:49:54,831
let the captain know and I'll have him
steam around in circles.

927
01:50:07,040 --> 01:50:13,388
James, there's something very important
I've been meaning to ask you. About us.

928
01:50:14,040 --> 01:50:15,155
Oh?

929
01:50:15,240 --> 01:50:21,236
I know in a relationship like ours, the girl's
not supposed to ask, but I can't help it.

930
01:50:21,320 --> 01:50:25,950
And please think before answering.

931
01:50:26,040 --> 01:50:28,873
- That I promise.
- James...

932
01:50:28,960 --> 01:50:30,439
<i>(knock at door)</i>

933
01:50:42,240 --> 01:50:45,710
There must be some mistake.
I didn't order anything.

934
01:50:45,800 --> 01:50:47,552
No mistake, sir.

935
01:50:47,640 --> 01:50:52,236
On the specific instructions and with
the compliments of Mr Willard Whyte.

936
01:50:52,320 --> 01:50:55,471
Oysters Andaluz.

937
01:50:55,560 --> 01:50:57,198
Shashlik.

938
01:50:57,600 --> 01:51:00,831
Tidbits. Prime rib <i>en jus.</i>

939
01:51:01,840 --> 01:51:03,831
Salade Utopia.

940
01:51:06,960 --> 01:51:11,272
And for dessert, the <i>pièce de résistance,</i>

941
01:51:13,040 --> 01:51:16,032
<i>la bombe surprise.</i>

942
01:51:16,120 --> 01:51:17,917
Hm!

943
01:51:18,000 --> 01:51:21,072
That looks fantastic. What's in it?

944
01:51:21,160 --> 01:51:24,869
But then there would be no <i>surprise,</i>
would there, madame?

945
01:51:24,960 --> 01:51:27,394
- If madam would care to be seated.
- Thank you.

946
01:51:27,480 --> 01:51:31,473
This will just take a moment,
and then we will leave you in peace.

947
01:51:32,480 --> 01:51:36,314
Wine, sir? Mouton Rothschild '55.

948
01:51:37,000 --> 01:51:39,753
- May we begin?
- <i>(Bond)</i> Please do.

949
01:51:43,400 --> 01:51:45,391
<i>(cork pops)</i>

950
01:51:52,200 --> 01:51:56,113
- A happy selection, if I may say.
- I'll be the judge of that.

951
01:51:56,200 --> 01:51:59,795
That's rather potent.
Not the cork - your aftershave.

952
01:51:59,880 --> 01:52:02,599
Strong enough to bury anything.

953
01:52:06,600 --> 01:52:09,239
But the wine is quite excellent.

954
01:52:09,320 --> 01:52:13,313
Although, for such a grand meal,
I had rather expected a claret.

955
01:52:13,400 --> 01:52:18,474
Of course. Unfortunately, our cellar
is rather poorly stocked with clarets.

956
01:52:20,400 --> 01:52:22,595
Mouton Rothschild is a claret.

957
01:52:24,720 --> 01:52:28,429
And I've smelt that aftershave before.
And both times I've smelt a rat.

958
01:52:39,320 --> 01:52:40,309
Yee!

959
01:52:52,200 --> 01:52:54,316
<i>(screams)</i>

960
01:53:13,760 --> 01:53:15,318
Whooh.

01:53:15,400 --> 01:53:16,799
Whooooh!

962
01:53:20,480 --> 01:53:21,515
Whoa!

963
01:53:27,240 --> 01:53:31,279
He certainly left
with his tails between his legs.

964
01:53:31,360 --> 01:53:33,635
Oh, James.

965
01:53:33,720 --> 01:53:37,156
Yes, what were you about to ask me?

966
01:53:37,240 --> 01:53:39,071
James...

967
01:53:39,160 --> 01:53:43,153
how the hell do we get
those diamonds down again?

968
01:53:47,320 --> 01:53:50,915
<i>~ Diamonds are forever</i>

01:53:51,000 --> 01:53:56,438
