1
00:00:02,010 --> 00:00:04,011
(crying):
To Gordon. Easy come, easy go.

2
00:00:04,013 --> 00:00:05,946
You told them I was dead?

3
00:00:05,948 --> 00:00:07,348
CAROL:<i> People always remember</i>
<i>the dead fondly.</i>

4
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:09,350
What a godforsaken tool.

5
00:00:09,352 --> 00:00:12,186
CAROL:<i> Phil broke up with Erica</i>
<i>and kissed me on the beach.</i>

6
00:00:12,188 --> 00:00:13,520
<i>Someone's coming back</i>
<i>to life today.</i>

7
00:00:13,522 --> 00:00:14,855
So he really has changed?

8
00:00:14,857 --> 00:00:17,758
Freeze! I just came here
to say I'm sorry.

9
00:00:19,661 --> 00:00:21,862
This is gonna blow over.

10
00:00:24,499 --> 00:00:27,401
Can somebody please
bring me some water?

11
00:00:27,403 --> 00:00:29,002
Please?

12
00:00:29,004 --> 00:00:31,839
I'm so thirsty.

13
00:00:31,841 --> 00:00:33,540
Come on, please?

14
00:00:33,542 --> 00:00:35,709
It's like a friggin' desert
in my mouth.

15
00:00:35,711 --> 00:00:37,311
Oh, my God.
Oh, Melissa.

16
00:00:37,313 --> 00:00:39,179
Oh, my God,
thank you so much.

17
00:00:39,181 --> 00:00:40,247
Oh, you're an angel.

18
00:00:40,249 --> 00:00:41,882
(chuckles):
You're an angel.

19
00:00:41,884 --> 00:00:43,384
Thank you so much.

20
00:00:43,386 --> 00:00:45,119
Oh, my God.

21
00:00:46,388 --> 00:00:48,188
Oh, God, uh, uh, Melissa,

22
00:00:48,190 --> 00:00:49,556
no, no, no.
Wait, wait, wait.

23
00:00:49,558 --> 00:00:52,126
No, Melissa, Melissa, I...

24
00:01:00,735 --> 00:01:02,302
God!

25
00:01:03,571 --> 00:01:05,272
Oh, hey, Phil.

26
00:01:05,274 --> 00:01:06,673
Top o' the morning.

27
00:01:06,675 --> 00:01:08,575
(stammering):
Uh, uh, wh...

28
00:01:08,577 --> 00:01:10,043
(coughs)

29
00:01:10,045 --> 00:01:11,879
So you like playing
with guns, huh?

30
00:01:11,881 --> 00:01:12,813
No, no, no...

31
00:01:13,782 --> 00:01:15,416
(sobbing)

32
00:01:15,418 --> 00:01:16,917
No! My gun was unloaded.

33
00:01:16,919 --> 00:01:18,419
I would've never hurt you guys.

34
00:01:18,421 --> 00:01:19,586
CAROL:
Phil!

35
00:01:19,588 --> 00:01:20,888
What are you doing?!

36
00:01:20,890 --> 00:01:22,389
Hey, Carol.

37
00:01:22,391 --> 00:01:24,691
Relax. Blanks.

38
00:01:24,693 --> 00:01:25,893
(Phil 2 chuckles)

39
00:01:25,895 --> 00:01:27,928
Boys.

40
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:29,897
You scared me, man.
God, look,
Hmm.

41
00:01:29,899 --> 00:01:31,432
I'm a different person, okay?

42
00:01:31,434 --> 00:01:32,933
I've changed. I really have.

43
00:01:32,935 --> 00:01:35,469
Well, I hope so...
for your sake.

44
00:01:49,818 --> 00:01:52,386
Gonna need a change of pants.

45
00:01:55,790 --> 00:01:58,358
Maybe some underwear, too.

46
00:02:00,128 --> 00:02:02,129
And some shoes...

47
00:02:02,131 --> 00:02:03,497
for sure.

48
00:02:07,802 --> 00:02:10,270
CAROL: Okay... he's been
in here long enough.

49
00:02:10,272 --> 00:02:12,072
Can we let him out now?

50
00:02:12,074 --> 00:02:13,273
PHIL 2:
No.

51
00:02:13,275 --> 00:02:14,675
He needs to be punished.

52
00:02:14,677 --> 00:02:17,344
But this is medieval, okay?
It's cruel.

53
00:02:17,346 --> 00:02:18,679
Carol, he held us
up at gunpoint.

54
00:02:18,681 --> 00:02:20,481
With an<i> unloaded</i> gun

55
00:02:20,483 --> 00:02:22,516
to deliver heartfelt apologies.

56
00:02:22,518 --> 00:02:24,117
PHIL: Look, I meant
everything I said.

57
00:02:24,119 --> 00:02:26,119
I care about you guys.

58
00:02:26,121 --> 00:02:29,189
You had a gun,
in our face!

59
00:02:29,191 --> 00:02:31,191
Tandy, I swear to God,
man, if I...

60
00:02:31,193 --> 00:02:32,526
Todd, calm down.
Take it easy.

61
00:02:32,528 --> 00:02:34,127
CAROL: So we're
really doing this?

62
00:02:34,129 --> 00:02:35,829
Is this who we are now?

63
00:02:35,831 --> 00:02:37,831
Carol, he did the crime,
now he's got to do the time.

64
00:02:37,833 --> 00:02:40,000
Okay, look, I
propose one week

65
00:02:40,002 --> 00:02:42,169
of solitary confinement
in the workout room.

66
00:02:42,171 --> 00:02:44,638
Got to say, I disagree
with that wholeheartedly.

67
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:47,674
Agreed. Don't you think that's
going a little overboard, huh?

68
00:02:47,676 --> 00:02:48,842
You think

69
00:02:48,844 --> 00:02:50,177
it's going overboard?
Yeah.

70
00:02:50,179 --> 00:02:52,546
'Cause I think
it's staying on the ship.

71
00:02:53,781 --> 00:02:56,016
One week of
solitary confinement?!

72
00:02:56,018 --> 00:02:58,018
For what I did?!
Yeah.

73
00:02:58,020 --> 00:02:59,553
Well, I say
how about two?

74
00:02:59,555 --> 00:03:01,054
Or three? Or four?

75
00:03:01,056 --> 00:03:02,856
Do I hear five?
Yeah, you do,

76
00:03:02,858 --> 00:03:05,125
from the man
in the stockade! Sold!

77
00:03:05,127 --> 00:03:06,460
Five it is!

78
00:03:06,462 --> 00:03:08,195
What are you doing?

79
00:03:08,197 --> 00:03:11,164
Like Phil said, I did the crime,
I got to do the time.

80
00:03:11,166 --> 00:03:13,534
Okay, look,
I really have changed,

81
00:03:13,536 --> 00:03:15,002
and I'm excited to prove it.

82
00:03:15,004 --> 00:03:16,036
CAROL:
Phil?

83
00:03:16,038 --> 00:03:17,538
Don't you mean Tandy?

84
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:19,306
Guys, over the last
six months,

85
00:03:19,308 --> 00:03:21,375
Carol's gone back
to calling me Phil again,

86
00:03:21,377 --> 00:03:23,377
and I have absolutely
loved it.

87
00:03:23,379 --> 00:03:25,679
Okay? After all,
it is my given name.

88
00:03:25,681 --> 00:03:28,015
But I'd like to request
that I go back to Tandy.

89
00:03:28,017 --> 00:03:30,817
It seemed helpful for you guys,
and that's important to me.

90
00:03:30,819 --> 00:03:33,153
Okay, don't worry, we were
never gonna call you Phil.

91
00:03:33,155 --> 00:03:34,721
Yeah, you are such a Tandy.

92
00:03:34,723 --> 00:03:38,358
Okay. Five weeks solitary
confinement it is.

93
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:39,760
Now we're talking.

94
00:03:39,762 --> 00:03:43,397
Okay? Like Phil said, I did
the crime, got to do that time,

95
00:03:43,399 --> 00:03:45,132
and that is nonnegotiable.

96
00:03:52,073 --> 00:03:53,540
Hey, Phil!

97
00:03:53,542 --> 00:03:54,875
Don't you mean Tandy?

98
00:03:54,877 --> 00:03:56,610
Fine. Tandy.

99
00:03:56,612 --> 00:03:58,445
Why's the door locked?

100
00:03:58,447 --> 00:04:00,380
Carol, this is my jail--
I'm being punished.

101
00:04:00,382 --> 00:04:02,516
And it wouldn't be
much of a punishment

102
00:04:02,518 --> 00:04:05,552
if I was able to fraternize
with the general pop.

103
00:04:05,554 --> 00:04:07,688
But they were gonna
let you out in one week.

104
00:04:07,690 --> 00:04:09,756
Why are you making it
harder on yourself?

105
00:04:09,758 --> 00:04:12,225
I've always taken
the easy way out,

106
00:04:12,227 --> 00:04:13,927
and I don't want
to do that anymore.

107
00:04:13,929 --> 00:04:15,896
I did the crime,
got to do that time.

108
00:04:15,898 --> 00:04:17,397
You know, C to the T.

109
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:19,466
You sure about this?

110
00:04:19,468 --> 00:04:21,101
Look, go have fun
and don't worry about me.

111
00:04:21,103 --> 00:04:23,437
For the next five weeks,
I got a new wife,

112
00:04:23,439 --> 00:04:26,173
and her name is Lady Justice.

113
00:04:36,417 --> 00:04:38,418
CAROL:
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm!

114
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:39,620
This cheese is

115
00:04:39,622 --> 00:04:41,288
for which to die, Todd.

116
00:04:41,290 --> 00:04:42,956
I am in hog heaven.

117
00:04:42,958 --> 00:04:44,891
Well, I'm glad
you're enjoying it, Carol.

118
00:04:44,893 --> 00:04:46,727
I am so sick of eating
canned foods, you guys.

119
00:04:46,729 --> 00:04:48,295
MELISSA:
Ugh, I know. I ate a can

120
00:04:48,297 --> 00:04:50,097
of tomato paste yesterday
that expired in July.

121
00:04:50,099 --> 00:04:51,465
That's nothing.

122
00:04:51,467 --> 00:04:54,768
I ate a whole jar of rancid
olives that expired in 2014.

123
00:04:54,770 --> 00:04:56,069
Ew!
Yeah.

124
00:04:56,071 --> 00:04:57,604
They were actually pretty good.

125
00:04:57,606 --> 00:04:59,339
MELISSA:
Well, with everything expiring,

126
00:04:59,341 --> 00:05:01,441
that cow's gonna be our main
food source soon, so...

127
00:05:01,443 --> 00:05:02,809
we got to keep her happy.

128
00:05:02,811 --> 00:05:04,745
Treat her like a queen.

129
00:05:04,747 --> 00:05:06,580
Where is she, by the way?

130
00:05:06,582 --> 00:05:09,016
We put a shock
collar on her.
Oh.

131
00:05:09,018 --> 00:05:10,817
Yeah, we set up
a little perimeter,

132
00:05:10,819 --> 00:05:12,986
so if she wanders too far,
she gets a little zap.

133
00:05:12,988 --> 00:05:13,987
Little zap.

134
00:05:13,989 --> 00:05:15,322
That's nice.

135
00:05:15,324 --> 00:05:16,823
Anybody want
some more wine?

136
00:05:16,825 --> 00:05:18,959
Let me think.

137
00:05:18,961 --> 00:05:20,827
Uh, yeah.
(laughing)

138
00:05:20,829 --> 00:05:24,164
All right,
I'm on it, I'm on it.

139
00:05:24,166 --> 00:05:26,466
Melissa, can you cut me off
a slice of that cheese?

140
00:05:26,468 --> 00:05:28,168
This one?
That one, yeah.

141
00:05:28,170 --> 00:05:29,636
Thank you!

142
00:05:29,638 --> 00:05:31,204
(moans)

143
00:05:32,173 --> 00:05:33,807
So...
(exhales)

144
00:05:33,809 --> 00:05:35,342
how are things
with you and Todd?

145
00:05:35,344 --> 00:05:36,343
Uh...

146
00:05:36,345 --> 00:05:38,645
he's just been kind of weird.

147
00:05:38,647 --> 00:05:40,180
Sexually?

148
00:05:40,182 --> 00:05:41,682
In every way.

149
00:05:41,684 --> 00:05:44,117
Uh, cold, kind of distant.

150
00:05:44,119 --> 00:05:45,318
Uh-oh.

151
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:47,254
Cheese'll make
you feel better.

152
00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:50,257
Mmm.

153
00:05:51,492 --> 00:05:54,461
♪ ♪

154
00:06:18,519 --> 00:06:21,922

156
00:06:54,255 --> 00:06:56,556
(whispering):
What are you doing, Tandy?

157
00:06:56,558 --> 00:06:58,558
You care about these people.

158
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,594
And you're gonna risk
your relationship with them

159
00:07:00,596 --> 00:07:03,330
over some
insanely delicious cheese?

160
00:07:11,372 --> 00:07:13,473
I'm not strong enough.

161
00:07:14,976 --> 00:07:17,277
No. You're better than this.

162
00:07:17,279 --> 00:07:21,782
Huh? Their friendship is worth
way more than this cheese.

163
00:07:21,784 --> 00:07:23,850
Get back in your hole.

164
00:07:38,266 --> 00:07:41,468
(wind chimes tinkling)

165
00:07:41,470 --> 00:07:43,503
Tandy's out.

166
00:07:49,644 --> 00:07:52,479
CAROL: You guys,
it was a tiny slipup.

167
00:07:52,481 --> 00:07:55,782
Tandy is a human being;
he's not chattel.

168
00:07:55,784 --> 00:07:57,317
Carol, agree to disagree.

169
00:07:57,319 --> 00:08:00,320
This shock collar
is exactly what I deserve.

170
00:08:00,322 --> 00:08:02,155
I did the crime--
you fill in the rest.

171
00:08:02,157 --> 00:08:05,325
But in case you can't, blah blah
blah blah blah... time.

172
00:08:05,327 --> 00:08:07,327
And besides, I'm not
even gonna come close
to these perimeters,

173
00:08:07,329 --> 00:08:09,329
so it's not even gonna be
a factor...
(electrical zapping)

174
00:08:09,331 --> 00:08:10,664
(Phil chuckles)

175
00:08:10,666 --> 00:08:11,965
Yeah, yeah,
thought I had

176
00:08:11,967 --> 00:08:14,100
a little more room there,
but no, got to learn

177
00:08:14,102 --> 00:08:15,669
these friggin' perimeters.
And then...

178
00:08:15,671 --> 00:08:17,504
(zapping)

00:16:01,770 --> 00:16:03,770
And you lost ours!

355
00:16:03,772 --> 00:16:05,271
I'm talking about... trust, man!

356
00:16:05,273 --> 00:16:06,439
ERICA:
Yeah.

357
00:16:06,441 --> 00:16:08,141
If you're gonna
act like an animal,

358
00:16:08,143 --> 00:16:10,076
we're gonna treat you
like an animal.

359
00:16:10,078 --> 00:16:12,945
Oh, yeah, this dog
is gonna go in a doghouse.

360
00:16:12,947 --> 00:16:14,647
Come on.
That's a good doggie.

361
00:16:14,649 --> 00:16:15,882
There, yeah.

362
00:16:31,799 --> 00:16:33,533
(snores)

363
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:34,534
(spray hisses)

364
00:16:34,536 --> 00:16:36,436
(coughing)

365
00:16:37,971 --> 00:16:40,039
(sniffles)

366
00:16:44,144 --> 00:16:45,678
(loud knocking)

367
00:16:46,847 --> 00:16:48,948
(knocking continues)

368
00:16:48,950 --> 00:16:51,184
(yelling, spray hissing)

369
00:16:51,186 --> 00:16:53,853
Guys!

370
00:17:14,241 --> 00:17:16,943
(zapping, screaming)

371
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:21,514
(whimpering, buzzing)

372
00:17:21,516 --> 00:17:23,383
Okay!

373
00:17:23,385 --> 00:17:24,717
(zapping, screaming continue)

374
00:17:28,222 --> 00:17:30,289
(zapping, screaming continue)

375
00:17:38,065 --> 00:17:41,434
(zapping, screaming continue)

376
00:17:48,509 --> 00:17:49,909
(grunting)

377
00:17:49,911 --> 00:17:51,978
(zapping, screaming stop)

378
00:17:54,081 --> 00:17:56,149
(panting)

379
00:18:11,098 --> 00:18:12,532
Oh. (muttering)

380
00:18:23,710 --> 00:18:25,044
Oh, my gosh.

381
00:18:25,046 --> 00:18:26,946
Looks like
a fire broke out!

382
00:18:26,948 --> 00:18:29,148
Gail, you weren't smoking,
were you?

383
00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:30,583
God, no.

384
00:18:30,585 --> 00:18:32,251
Not out here anyway.

385
00:18:32,253 --> 00:18:34,887
No, it was clearly
the tiki torch.

386
00:18:34,889 --> 00:18:36,789
All right,
somebody put it out.

387
00:18:36,791 --> 00:18:39,125
Todd?
Oh, I must have slept
right through it.

388
00:18:39,127 --> 00:18:40,793
Hmm.

389
00:18:40,795 --> 00:18:42,595
Well, if it wasn't
one of us,

390
00:18:42,597 --> 00:18:43,896
who was it?

391
00:18:43,898 --> 00:18:45,965
I think I know.

392
00:18:49,069 --> 00:18:51,170
Do you know anything
about this fire?

393
00:18:53,474 --> 00:18:54,807
Well, do you know
who put it out?

394
00:18:58,479 --> 00:19:00,480
Tandy saw the fire.

395
00:19:02,449 --> 00:19:04,450
Oh, and he called out.

396
00:19:04,452 --> 00:19:07,753
Oh, but everyone
was asleep.

397
00:19:07,755 --> 00:19:09,322
What's he gonna do?
What's he gonna do? Oh.

398
00:19:09,324 --> 00:19:10,523
He's gonna break
out of the shed!

399
00:19:10,525 --> 00:19:12,158
He broke out
of the shed.

400
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:14,627
And he ran through
the shock zone! Ow!

401
00:19:14,629 --> 00:19:16,796
And then he got
water from the pool.

402
00:19:16,798 --> 00:19:19,599
And he went back and
forth and back and forth,

403
00:19:19,601 --> 00:19:22,802
and he got shocked again and
again and again and again

404
00:19:22,804 --> 00:19:25,137
until the fire was out.

405
00:19:25,139 --> 00:19:26,506
And then,

406
00:19:26,508 --> 00:19:29,809
he was left on the
hillside, depleted.

407
00:19:29,811 --> 00:19:32,512
And then, after saving
all of our lives...

408
00:19:34,681 --> 00:19:36,782
...he got back
in his shed,

409
00:19:36,784 --> 00:19:38,851
like the good
prisoner that he is.

410
00:19:38,853 --> 00:19:41,187
And I think
I'm right in saying

411
00:19:41,189 --> 00:19:44,290
Tandy did his time.

412
00:20:02,376 --> 00:20:04,377
Thank you so much.

413
00:20:04,379 --> 00:20:06,212
Oh, my God, you guys,
thank you so much.

414
00:20:06,214 --> 00:20:07,547
And I know
this doesn't mean that...

415
00:20:07,549 --> 00:20:09,081
that, like, I'm back
in your good graces,

416
00:20:09,083 --> 00:20:10,483
but this is
a good first step.

417
00:20:10,485 --> 00:20:12,218
And I look forward
to proving myself to you guys

418
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:14,220
and regaining your trust,
because I have changed.

419
00:20:14,222 --> 00:20:16,055
And you guys are
really important to me!

420
00:20:16,057 --> 00:20:18,224
And I'm so excited
about the future,

421
00:20:18,226 --> 00:20:19,892
and I hope you are, too!

422
00:20:19,894 --> 00:20:21,894
(laughing):
God!

423
00:20:21,896 --> 00:20:23,396
Aah!

424
00:20:23,398 --> 00:20:24,864
I hope you are, too.

425
00:20:24,866 --> 00:20:26,732
(laughs)

426
00:20:50,924 --> 00:20:53,492
Daddy's home.

427
00:21:30,397 --> 00:21:31,897
CHILDREN:
<i>Uncle Stinky.</i>

428
00:21:31,899 --> 00:21:33,399
(horn honking)
