1
00:01:44,737 --> 00:01:47,539
<i>Fuck me.</i>

2
00:01:47,774 --> 00:01:51,009
<i>I can't believe
I'm going to die in this place.</i>

3
00:01:51,711 --> 00:01:56,815
<i>But, as far as headstones go,
a man could do a lot worse.</i>

4
00:01:59,285 --> 00:02:01,186
<i>I'm Charlie Wolfe.</i>

5
00:02:01,188 --> 00:02:05,991
<i>And as I lie here, waiting
for death's cold embrace,</i>

6
00:02:05,993 --> 00:02:08,594
<i>I find myself asking
the question,</i>

7
00:02:08,596 --> 00:02:12,030
<i>"How the fuck
did it come to this?"</i>

8
00:02:12,032 --> 00:02:15,100
<i>I don't die. I thrive.</i>

9
00:02:47,934 --> 00:02:49,535
Fuck.

10
00:03:37,617 --> 00:03:40,385
Oh! Argh!

11
00:03:52,432 --> 00:03:55,667
Argh!

12
00:04:05,912 --> 00:04:08,547
Argh!

13
00:04:23,696 --> 00:04:24,997
Fuck!

14
00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:53,759
Yeah? Yeah.

15
00:04:54,961 --> 00:04:57,162
I'm... I'm sorry. Could you
hang on one second?

16
00:05:03,003 --> 00:05:06,505
Yeah, I'll be there
in an hour.

17
00:06:38,298 --> 00:06:40,065
Good morning.
Doctor Webb Dental Surgery.

18
00:06:40,067 --> 00:06:43,001
<i>Hi, Lucy. This is Alice.</i>

19
00:06:43,003 --> 00:06:44,069
Hi, Alice.

20
00:06:44,071 --> 00:06:46,438
Do you think Nathan
can see me this afternoon?

21
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:48,507
<i>I'm actually in a lot of pain.</i>

22
00:06:48,509 --> 00:06:52,377
Sure. I think
we can fit you in.

23
00:06:52,379 --> 00:06:54,012
<i>How's 2:00?</i>

24
00:06:54,014 --> 00:06:55,614
Perfect. I'll see you at 2:00.

25
00:06:55,616 --> 00:06:58,150
Alright. See you later.

26
00:07:00,954 --> 00:07:01,954
Nathan!

27
00:07:01,955 --> 00:07:03,021
Come on, mate.

28
00:07:03,023 --> 00:07:05,457
Please just sort me out
this one last time.

29
00:07:05,459 --> 00:07:09,861
Fifty thousand on Silver Tsar
to win.

30
00:07:09,863 --> 00:07:12,697
Thanks. You're a saint.

31
00:07:12,699 --> 00:07:15,901
<i>Nathan!</i>

32
00:07:15,903 --> 00:07:19,871
Change of plans.
She's coming today.

33
00:07:19,873 --> 00:07:21,239
I'm not ready.

34
00:07:22,675 --> 00:07:27,779
Switch my dental records and
let's get my car to the quarry.

35
00:07:27,781 --> 00:07:29,848
Shit.

36
00:08:37,016 --> 00:08:38,483
She's here.

37
00:08:38,485 --> 00:08:41,119
<i>Have you swapped
those dental records?</i>

38
00:09:08,648 --> 00:09:10,448
- Hi.
- Hi.

39
00:09:10,450 --> 00:09:12,517
- I'm sorry I'm late.
- It's okay.

40
00:09:12,519 --> 00:09:16,288
- What happened?
- Oh, I hit the door.

41
00:09:16,290 --> 00:09:18,189
<i>Oh, you poor thing!</i>

42
00:09:18,191 --> 00:09:21,826
<i>Nathan, Alice is here!</i>

43
00:09:25,865 --> 00:09:29,167
Hi, Nathan.
- Hi, Alice.

44
00:09:29,169 --> 00:09:30,302
Okay.

45
00:09:30,304 --> 00:09:33,071
- Yeah, shall we?
- Yeah.

46
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:15,747
Do I really need an injection?

47
00:10:15,749 --> 00:10:17,649
Yes. But I will be gentle.

48
00:10:17,651 --> 00:10:19,117
I think I...

49
00:10:19,119 --> 00:10:21,286
Now, lie back... and open.

50
00:10:49,448 --> 00:10:51,816
Took you long enough.
Is she out?

51
00:10:51,818 --> 00:10:53,451
Cold.

52
00:10:53,453 --> 00:10:55,687
- Grab her jewelry.
- Yeah.

53
00:11:12,505 --> 00:11:15,540
- Did you see something?
- No.

54
00:11:15,542 --> 00:11:19,277
You remember the petrol?

55
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:20,345
Must I think of everything?

56
00:11:20,347 --> 00:11:22,781
There's a garage on the way.

57
00:11:22,783 --> 00:11:24,503
Don't take forever.
I'll be waiting.

58
00:11:42,101 --> 00:11:44,135
<i>Ready to go in
the fifth event, Blacktown...</i>

59
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:53,378
<i>Silver Tsar's coming up...</i>

60
00:12:12,299 --> 00:12:14,299
<i>Here's Silver Tsar
taken to the outside</i>

61
00:12:14,301 --> 00:12:16,801
<i>and the well-tried favorite
lights up.</i>

62
00:12:16,803 --> 00:12:19,137
<i>It's Silver Tsar racing
the Blacktown Lad and Daytone.</i>

63
00:12:19,139 --> 00:12:20,505
- <i> He's taken over the running.</i>
- Get up!

64
00:12:20,507 --> 00:12:22,574
<i>And the favorite's looking
really good at the moment.</i>

65
00:12:22,576 --> 00:12:24,536
<i>He raced two lengths
in front of...</i>

66
00:12:26,546 --> 00:12:32,083
Not now, not now.
Please, not now.

67
00:12:32,085 --> 00:12:34,385
<i>Silver Tsar has the lead
but he's getting tired.</i>

68
00:12:34,387 --> 00:12:36,888
<i>Daytone's coming back
and so is Madison Rose.</i>

69
00:12:36,890 --> 00:12:38,923
<i>Oh, there's a fall!
The favorite's down!</i>

70
00:12:38,925 --> 00:12:40,725
- Shit!
- <i> Silver Tsar's fallen.</i>

71
00:12:40,727 --> 00:12:42,227
<i>- You wouldn't believe it.</i>
- Shit!

72
00:12:42,229 --> 00:12:43,328
Shit, shit, shit!

73
00:12:43,330 --> 00:12:45,563
<i>Victory in his sights
and he's down...</i>

74
00:12:53,172 --> 00:12:56,541
<i>...wonder of the world, and down
he went with only 50m to go.</i>

75
00:12:56,543 --> 00:12:59,277
Que sera.
<i>That's racing, I guess.</i>

76
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:02,413
<i>It's bad luck for the punters
that they lose their money.</i>

77
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:04,876
Fucking hell!

78
00:14:17,623 --> 00:14:19,057
Fuck!

79
00:14:37,042 --> 00:14:38,209
Nathan,
how are you going?

80
00:14:38,211 --> 00:14:41,746
Uh, I'm alright.
I've just... just got a flat.

81
00:14:41,748 --> 00:14:43,448
Oh, yeah. Need a hand?

82
00:14:43,450 --> 00:14:45,884
Nah, all good. I got it.

83
00:14:45,886 --> 00:14:47,719
No worries at all, mate.

84
00:14:47,721 --> 00:14:50,321
Thanks.

85
00:14:55,661 --> 00:14:56,928
You still planning on leaving?

86
00:14:56,930 --> 00:14:59,464
I'm way beyond planning.

87
00:14:59,466 --> 00:15:01,633
I'm doing. Today.

88
00:15:01,635 --> 00:15:03,534
Good on you.

89
00:15:07,173 --> 00:15:09,140
Do you need anything else?

90
00:15:09,142 --> 00:15:14,178
Yeah, um...
you got any large waters?

91
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:15,813
<i>Yeah, I've got some
out the back.</i>

92
00:15:15,815 --> 00:15:18,216
Thanks.

93
00:15:32,498 --> 00:15:38,469
Are you a tourist?

94
00:15:38,471 --> 00:15:41,773
Something like that.

95
00:15:41,775 --> 00:15:43,408
Here you go.

96
00:15:43,410 --> 00:15:45,476
Sorry it's not cold.
Just the one?

97
00:15:45,478 --> 00:15:48,479
Uh, yeah, better give me
$20 worth of petrol.

98
00:15:48,481 --> 00:15:49,580
Yeah, no worries.

99
00:15:54,753 --> 00:15:57,622
You can't smoke in here.

100
00:16:04,164 --> 00:16:07,632
Cheers, Dylan. Good luck.

101
00:17:13,832 --> 00:17:15,767
What kept you this time?

102
00:17:15,769 --> 00:17:17,101
I got a flat.

103
00:17:17,103 --> 00:17:19,103
It's always something with you.

104
00:17:19,105 --> 00:17:20,371
It was an accident.

105
00:17:20,373 --> 00:17:22,507
Come on, then.
Let's get on with it.

106
00:17:22,509 --> 00:17:29,047
It's you we should be insuring,
not me.

107
00:18:05,384 --> 00:18:07,718
- Oh... shit!
- Oh, fuck!

108
00:18:31,276 --> 00:18:33,578
Nathan!

109
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:39,417
Don't worry. It'll sink.

110
00:18:39,419 --> 00:18:42,120
Soon.

111
00:18:42,122 --> 00:18:43,521
Get in there!

112
00:18:43,523 --> 00:18:48,693
Alright.

113
00:18:59,705 --> 00:19:02,507
Fuck, Luce, it's really cold.

114
00:19:11,683 --> 00:19:15,453
Let's go.

115
00:19:15,455 --> 00:19:19,490
Fuck me.

116
00:20:01,867 --> 00:20:05,403
Grab the bag.

117
00:20:05,405 --> 00:20:10,508
<i>- Petrol?
- In the back seat.</i>

118
00:20:10,510 --> 00:20:12,276
<i>What the fuck is this?</i>

119
00:20:12,278 --> 00:20:13,411
It's the petrol.

120
00:20:13,413 --> 00:20:15,112
Where's the rest of it?

121
00:20:15,114 --> 00:20:17,281
<i>That'll be enough.</i>

122
00:20:24,556 --> 00:20:25,756
Argh!

123
00:20:26,992 --> 00:20:28,859
Alice...

124
00:20:28,861 --> 00:20:30,127
calm down.

125
00:20:30,129 --> 00:20:32,997
Ah!

126
00:20:32,999 --> 00:20:35,066
Fuck!

127
00:20:35,068 --> 00:20:37,568
Nathan, get up!
She's getting away!

128
00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:39,971
Oh, fuck's sake!

129
00:20:39,973 --> 00:20:45,810
Huh?

130
00:20:45,812 --> 00:20:47,144
Oi!

131
00:20:56,989 --> 00:20:58,656
Lucy!

132
00:21:08,567 --> 00:21:09,867
Fuck.

133
00:21:15,841 --> 00:21:18,476
Argh!

134
00:21:39,398 --> 00:21:41,299
- Hey.
- Let's fucking do this.

135
00:21:41,301 --> 00:21:44,368
- Where is she?
- In the back seat.

136
00:22:06,558 --> 00:22:10,027
- Jewelry's on the dash.
- Yeah.

137
00:22:10,029 --> 00:22:11,462
Just get her in.

138
00:22:11,464 --> 00:22:13,030
Not so fucking easy.

139
00:22:13,032 --> 00:22:17,635
Hey, you don't have to be so
gentle. Just get her in there.

140
00:22:17,637 --> 00:22:20,004
Okay.

141
00:22:20,006 --> 00:22:22,406
Ow.

142
00:22:31,183 --> 00:22:32,883
Sorry, Alice.

143
00:22:47,165 --> 00:22:48,866
Goodbye, Alice.

144
00:23:42,654 --> 00:23:45,589
No, I'm fine.
I can't. I'm working.

145
00:23:45,591 --> 00:23:48,159
Great.

146
00:23:48,161 --> 00:23:49,226
Alright, ready?

147
00:23:49,228 --> 00:23:51,128
Cheers!

148
00:23:56,202 --> 00:23:57,535
I agreed to help out

149
00:23:57,537 --> 00:23:59,103
but not so you can sit around
on your fucking arse.

150
00:23:59,105 --> 00:24:00,504
I'll be another minute.

151
00:24:00,506 --> 00:24:04,875
- Jack, we need to talk.
- Not now.

152
00:24:04,877 --> 00:24:06,577
Your marriage is a joke.

153
00:24:06,579 --> 00:24:12,149
She's given up
on your whole pathetic act.

154
00:24:12,151 --> 00:24:14,885
Do you know
that you're the la...

155
00:24:14,887 --> 00:24:16,554
Enough.

156
00:24:16,556 --> 00:24:18,556
Why don't you
and your deadbeat husband

157
00:24:18,558 --> 00:24:21,425
mind your own
fucking business?

158
00:24:21,427 --> 00:24:23,494
Jack, you're my brother.

159
00:24:23,496 --> 00:24:26,297
I can't just stand by
and watch this happen.

160
00:24:26,299 --> 00:24:27,932
Are you done?

161
00:24:27,934 --> 00:24:30,768
Have you made that call?

162
00:24:30,770 --> 00:24:35,606
Hire him and have her followed.

163
00:24:35,608 --> 00:24:39,043
If I'm wrong,
then I won't say another word.

164
00:25:09,575 --> 00:25:11,842
Jack, we need to get
more tequi...

165
00:25:16,615 --> 00:25:19,250
When did you get a gun?

166
00:25:19,252 --> 00:25:21,118
Is everything okay?

167
00:25:30,495 --> 00:25:31,929
Sit down.

168
00:25:51,716 --> 00:25:54,251
Pick it up.

169
00:25:54,253 --> 00:25:56,220
Please put the gun down.

170
00:25:56,222 --> 00:26:02,726
I said pick it fucking up.

171
00:26:02,728 --> 00:26:07,197
Do you have any idea
how much I love you?

172
00:26:17,442 --> 00:26:21,679
You don't love me.

173
00:26:21,681 --> 00:26:24,148
You just want to control me.

174
00:26:33,992 --> 00:26:36,327
Alice.

175
00:26:36,329 --> 00:26:38,929
Are you seeing someone else?

176
00:26:38,931 --> 00:26:43,167
'Cause I couldn't handle
something like that.

177
00:26:43,169 --> 00:26:46,570
I'd sooner see you dead.

178
00:26:46,572 --> 00:26:48,205
I need to go.

179
00:27:23,441 --> 00:27:26,710
- Yeah.

180
00:27:26,712 --> 00:27:28,412
Sorry, just hold on a sec.

181
00:27:34,986 --> 00:27:38,222
Yeah, I'll be there in an hour.

182
00:29:37,976 --> 00:29:42,045
- What are you doing?
- Jack, you're hurting me.

183
00:29:42,047 --> 00:29:43,747
What are you fucking doing
sneaking around?

184
00:29:43,749 --> 00:29:45,249
I wasn't sneaking around.

185
00:29:54,593 --> 00:29:58,362
That's the last time
you hit me.

186
00:29:58,364 --> 00:30:02,566
Alice, I'm sorry!

187
00:30:45,210 --> 00:30:49,680
Ow.

188
00:30:49,682 --> 00:30:51,548
Yeah, your tooth is chipped.

189
00:31:04,963 --> 00:31:08,498
Sorry, it's all I've got.

190
00:31:11,169 --> 00:31:13,136
Thank you.

191
00:31:18,910 --> 00:31:21,078
You'll be okay on your own
for a few?

192
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:24,748
Why? Where are you going?

193
00:31:24,750 --> 00:31:26,350
I'm gonna pay Jack a visit.

194
00:31:26,352 --> 00:31:29,152
Dylan... Dylan.

195
00:31:29,154 --> 00:31:33,156
Dylan!

196
00:31:33,158 --> 00:31:37,861
Come here.

197
00:31:37,863 --> 00:31:38,929
Stay with me.

198
00:31:38,931 --> 00:31:41,365
Somebody needs to
sort that prick out.

199
00:31:41,367 --> 00:31:44,268
Stay with me.

200
00:31:44,270 --> 00:31:49,373
Please?

201
00:31:49,375 --> 00:31:51,541
Please.

202
00:32:33,551 --> 00:32:35,018
Ooh!

203
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:58,508
Jack wasn't always like this.

204
00:32:58,510 --> 00:33:01,712
Doesn't excuse what he does.

205
00:33:01,714 --> 00:33:05,682
You know what he told me
earlier?

206
00:33:05,684 --> 00:33:09,419
That he'd sooner see me dead
than with another guy.

207
00:33:09,421 --> 00:33:11,588
He actually said that?

208
00:33:11,590 --> 00:33:15,993
The scariest part...

209
00:33:15,995 --> 00:33:21,698
is that he was pointing this
at me when he said that.

210
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:23,433
Fucking hell.

211
00:33:23,435 --> 00:33:26,003
Good thing we're leaving
tomorrow.

212
00:33:32,210 --> 00:33:34,578
You sure you want to go?

213
00:33:34,580 --> 00:33:36,780
Of course I'm sure.

214
00:33:36,782 --> 00:33:39,116
But you haven't sold
the garage yet.

215
00:33:39,118 --> 00:33:41,451
Things will be tight.

216
00:33:41,453 --> 00:33:44,187
Money's always a problem
when you don't have much.

217
00:33:44,189 --> 00:33:48,058
- I'll get a job.

218
00:33:48,060 --> 00:33:51,228
We can make enough
for the both of us.

219
00:35:28,993 --> 00:35:32,896
Sure. I think
we can fit you in.

220
00:35:32,898 --> 00:35:34,698
<i>How's 2:00?</i>

221
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:36,133
Perfect. I'll see you at 2:00.

222
00:35:36,135 --> 00:35:37,734
Alright. See you later.

223
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:43,273
Nathan!

224
00:35:53,919 --> 00:35:59,556
Are you sober?

225
00:35:59,558 --> 00:36:05,162
Mostly.

226
00:36:05,164 --> 00:36:06,563
I'm sorry, Alice.

227
00:36:06,565 --> 00:36:07,964
You're always sorry.

228
00:36:20,912 --> 00:36:21,945
Yeah.

229
00:36:21,947 --> 00:36:23,380
<i>This is Charlie Wolfe.</i>

230
00:36:23,382 --> 00:36:24,548
Hang on.

231
00:36:24,550 --> 00:36:26,449
Oi. Shut the door?

232
00:36:34,025 --> 00:36:35,258
Yeah.

233
00:36:35,260 --> 00:36:38,562
<i>I have something
you might want to see.</i>

234
00:36:38,564 --> 00:36:39,963
Okay.

235
00:36:39,965 --> 00:36:41,531
<i>Should I drop in?</i>

236
00:36:41,533 --> 00:36:43,466
No.

237
00:36:43,468 --> 00:36:46,036
You know the car park
by Merchant Rock?

238
00:36:46,038 --> 00:36:48,572
<i>I'll be there in an hour.</i>

239
00:36:50,776 --> 00:36:55,078
Hey, Bruce.

240
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:56,746
Where's Jack?

241
00:36:56,748 --> 00:36:58,381
In his office.

242
00:37:07,825 --> 00:37:09,526
You must be tired.

243
00:37:09,528 --> 00:37:11,127
Yeah, a little.

244
00:37:11,129 --> 00:37:14,264
Running around town
the way you do.

245
00:37:14,266 --> 00:37:17,200
All hours of the day and night.

246
00:37:17,202 --> 00:37:19,269
Excuse me?

247
00:37:19,271 --> 00:37:22,439
- Bruce.
- Jack. The very man.

248
00:37:22,441 --> 00:37:24,774
Just checking on that
case of whisky you promised.

249
00:37:24,776 --> 00:37:27,344
Is later alright, mate?
I'm just heading out.

250
00:37:27,346 --> 00:37:31,915
Yeah. Long as it's not
too much later.

251
00:37:31,917 --> 00:37:33,683
Right?

252
00:37:39,857 --> 00:37:41,791
Give us your car keys.

253
00:37:41,793 --> 00:37:42,993
What's wrong with your car?

254
00:37:42,995 --> 00:37:46,196
It's still at the paint shop.

255
00:37:46,198 --> 00:37:48,231
Will you be long?

256
00:37:48,233 --> 00:37:49,766
As long as it takes.

257
00:37:49,768 --> 00:37:53,303
I have an appointment
with Nathan at 2:00.

258
00:38:17,194 --> 00:38:18,561
Shit.

259
00:40:58,122 --> 00:41:00,223
Wolfe!

260
00:41:10,268 --> 00:41:12,235
I didn't expect your call
so soon.

261
00:41:12,237 --> 00:41:14,904
Sometimes
they make it too easy.

262
00:41:27,084 --> 00:41:33,656
This was last night?

263
00:41:33,658 --> 00:41:37,060
Jesus.

264
00:41:37,062 --> 00:41:43,967
Do you have something for me?

265
00:41:43,969 --> 00:41:45,468
I'm keeping this.

266
00:41:45,470 --> 00:41:46,769
Be my guest.

267
00:41:46,771 --> 00:41:51,508
I bought it just for you.

268
00:41:51,510 --> 00:41:54,410
You feel like staying on
for a few days?

269
00:41:54,412 --> 00:41:55,979
No sense hanging around.

270
00:41:55,981 --> 00:42:00,450
I've got something for you,
if you're interested.

271
00:42:00,452 --> 00:42:01,484
I'm listening.

272
00:42:01,486 --> 00:42:03,286
How does 50 grand sound?

273
00:42:04,523 --> 00:42:06,689
Like a dirty job.

274
00:42:06,691 --> 00:42:10,293
And I'm still listening.

275
00:42:10,295 --> 00:42:12,262
I want you to kill my wife.

276
00:42:12,264 --> 00:42:14,230
Make the bitch disappear.

277
00:42:14,232 --> 00:42:17,734
Jack, you've worked yourself
into a knot over this thing.

278
00:42:17,736 --> 00:42:18,768
Fine.

279
00:42:18,770 --> 00:42:21,104
You're reacting badly
to some bad news.

280
00:42:21,106 --> 00:42:23,773
- Just take some time.
- My mind is clear.

281
00:42:23,775 --> 00:42:27,844
What you're talking about is a
one-way street. You understand?

282
00:42:27,846 --> 00:42:31,047
Once you start,
there is no going back.

283
00:42:36,253 --> 00:42:38,588
She's had fair warning.

284
00:42:38,590 --> 00:42:42,559
She knew the consequences
and she did it anyway.

285
00:42:42,561 --> 00:42:44,460
So fuck her.

286
00:42:44,462 --> 00:42:46,129
You want my money or not?

287
00:42:52,303 --> 00:42:56,306
Do you have that sort
of cash just lying around?

288
00:42:56,308 --> 00:42:57,473
It's covered.

289
00:42:57,475 --> 00:42:59,509
I mean untraceable.

290
00:42:59,511 --> 00:43:01,377
This kind of job
doesn't come with a receipt.

291
00:43:01,379 --> 00:43:02,812
I told you, it's covered.

292
00:43:02,814 --> 00:43:05,481
There is, of course,
the issue of trust.

293
00:43:05,483 --> 00:43:06,683
I trust you.

294
00:43:06,685 --> 00:43:07,784
Yes, but how can I be sure

295
00:43:07,786 --> 00:43:09,852
you're not gonna go soft
on me, Jack?

296
00:43:09,854 --> 00:43:13,923
Well, we'll have to
trust each other.

297
00:43:13,925 --> 00:43:16,559
Did you and your wife
ever trust each other?

298
00:43:16,561 --> 00:43:18,695
You don't want the job? Fine.
Forget I asked.

299
00:43:18,697 --> 00:43:20,563
I don't remember saying no.

300
00:43:20,565 --> 00:43:22,265
So are you saying yes?

301
00:43:29,073 --> 00:43:31,207
Alright, I'll do it.

302
00:43:31,209 --> 00:43:33,443
But not for 50 grand.

303
00:43:33,445 --> 00:43:35,111
How much?

304
00:43:35,113 --> 00:43:36,779
My rate's an even one.

305
00:43:36,781 --> 00:43:38,147
Sixty?

306
00:43:38,149 --> 00:43:41,584
No, 100.

307
00:43:41,586 --> 00:43:43,653
I'm what you call
a professional.

308
00:43:43,655 --> 00:43:46,289
Quality always costs.

309
00:43:46,291 --> 00:43:51,461
So are we on?

310
00:43:51,463 --> 00:43:55,698
She has a dental
appointment at 2:00.

311
00:43:55,700 --> 00:43:58,901
I'd be fine with her
never coming home.

312
00:43:58,903 --> 00:44:00,336
Alright, here's
what I want you to do.

313
00:44:00,338 --> 00:44:04,474
Go back to the bar,
and stay there, in plain sight.

314
00:44:04,476 --> 00:44:06,776
Smile for everyone,
and don't act funny.

315
00:44:06,778 --> 00:44:08,378
I'll contact you
when it's done.

316
00:44:08,380 --> 00:44:10,880
I'll be expecting your call.

317
00:44:10,882 --> 00:44:12,148
Oh, Jack?

318
00:44:12,150 --> 00:44:14,584
Don't go putting that online,
now, will you?

319
00:44:18,189 --> 00:44:19,689
Lucy.

320
00:44:19,691 --> 00:44:22,925
I can't go through with it.

321
00:44:22,927 --> 00:44:25,061
Can't?

322
00:44:26,898 --> 00:44:32,468
Shit.

323
00:44:32,470 --> 00:44:34,270
Whatever he wants,
get rid of him.

324
00:44:34,272 --> 00:44:36,706
I'll handle it.

325
00:44:42,681 --> 00:44:45,014
G'day, Bruce.
How are you going?

326
00:44:50,021 --> 00:44:52,288
I was up the big smoke
last night.

327
00:44:52,290 --> 00:44:54,490
Met a bookmaker we all know.

328
00:44:54,492 --> 00:44:56,392
- Who's that?
- Evan Black.

329
00:44:56,394 --> 00:45:00,063
- You know Evan?
- He's a relative.

330
00:45:00,065 --> 00:45:02,331
I had no idea.

331
00:45:02,333 --> 00:45:04,167
You know how it is around here.

332
00:45:04,169 --> 00:45:06,469
We're all related
one way or another.

333
00:45:06,471 --> 00:45:08,838
Yeah. Small world.

334
00:45:08,840 --> 00:45:11,774
Evan says
you've been avoiding him.

335
00:45:11,776 --> 00:45:13,076
Says you owe him
heaps of money,

336
00:45:13,078 --> 00:45:14,677
and so far you haven't made
good on a single marker.

337
00:45:14,679 --> 00:45:17,980
Look, it's okay.
I am gonna pay him.

338
00:45:17,982 --> 00:45:20,783
- I gave him my word.
- Fuck your word.

339
00:45:20,785 --> 00:45:22,318
He wants his money.

340
00:45:22,320 --> 00:45:26,355
And he will get it, on my oath.

341
00:45:26,357 --> 00:45:28,458
You disrespected him.

342
00:45:28,460 --> 00:45:31,627
He arranged for the lads
to come see you.

343
00:45:31,629 --> 00:45:34,697
But I talked him out of it.

344
00:45:34,699 --> 00:45:36,866
I said I'd come see you first.

345
00:45:36,868 --> 00:45:39,769
Promised him I'd collect
everything you...

346
00:45:39,771 --> 00:45:40,803
within the week.

347
00:45:40,805 --> 00:45:47,677
Failing that...
I'd kill you meself.

348
00:45:47,679 --> 00:45:50,113
Bruce... we're good
for the money.

349
00:45:50,115 --> 00:45:52,982
Well, we will be.

350
00:45:52,984 --> 00:45:57,120
I just need
a little bit more time.

351
00:45:57,122 --> 00:45:58,354
How much time?

352
00:45:58,356 --> 00:45:59,689
Couple of months.

353
00:46:02,494 --> 00:46:04,160
You're taking the piss.

354
00:46:04,162 --> 00:46:05,061
No.

355
00:46:05,063 --> 00:46:09,432
Where's this money
coming from in a few months?

356
00:46:09,434 --> 00:46:12,769
I can't tell you,
but it is real, okay? I promise.

357
00:46:12,771 --> 00:46:15,171
Don't come
the raw fuckin' prawn.

358
00:46:15,173 --> 00:46:16,706
You've got one week.

359
00:46:16,708 --> 00:46:19,242
We're talking about
near 250 grand.

360
00:46:19,244 --> 00:46:20,943
That was before.

361
00:46:20,945 --> 00:46:23,379
- Before what?
- Me.

362
00:46:23,381 --> 00:46:24,647
How much now?

363
00:46:24,649 --> 00:46:26,382
Now?

364
00:46:26,384 --> 00:46:28,417
Now we're talking about
a figure so close to $300,000

365
00:46:28,419 --> 00:46:29,886
we may as well call it that.

366
00:46:29,888 --> 00:46:31,954
No, we never agreed to that.
Are you insane?

367
00:46:31,956 --> 00:46:33,990
- Non-negotiable.
- You can't be serious.

368
00:46:33,992 --> 00:46:37,593
Let me show you how serious
I am. Come here.

369
00:46:37,595 --> 00:46:38,961
Nah, it's alright.

370
00:46:38,963 --> 00:46:41,497
- Bruce, please.
- Don't have me ask twice.

371
00:46:41,499 --> 00:46:44,433
Argh, Bruce! Bruce!

372
00:46:44,435 --> 00:46:47,503
You've got one week.

373
00:46:47,505 --> 00:46:48,505
Now, say it.

374
00:46:50,208 --> 00:46:53,643
Bruce, stop.

375
00:46:59,917 --> 00:47:03,419
You think he got the message?

376
00:47:03,421 --> 00:47:05,621
- Well?
- Yes.

377
00:47:05,623 --> 00:47:08,124
Bruce, we get it, okay?
We've got a week.

378
00:47:08,126 --> 00:47:12,261
Or else?

379
00:47:12,263 --> 00:47:14,697
I'm asking you.

380
00:47:14,699 --> 00:47:16,132
Or...

381
00:47:16,134 --> 00:47:21,504
You'll kill us.

382
00:47:21,506 --> 00:47:23,139
Have the money in a week.

383
00:47:48,098 --> 00:47:51,267
Lucy,
I'm sorry.

384
00:47:51,269 --> 00:47:56,906
Don't touch me!

385
00:47:56,908 --> 00:47:58,708
You just stood there.

386
00:47:58,710 --> 00:48:04,380
I didn't mean
for any of this to happen.

387
00:48:04,382 --> 00:48:06,315
We go ahead with it.

388
00:48:06,317 --> 00:48:09,285
We need that insurance money
more than ever now.

389
00:48:09,287 --> 00:48:11,888
Okay.

390
00:48:33,744 --> 00:48:35,478
Where have you been?
I'm late.

391
00:48:35,480 --> 00:48:36,946
Went for a drive.

392
00:48:36,948 --> 00:48:38,180
My car keys?

393
00:49:16,954 --> 00:49:18,587
Goodbye, Alice.

394
00:49:39,677 --> 00:49:41,677
Oh, my God!

395
00:49:41,679 --> 00:49:44,080
Shit! No!

396
00:50:10,273 --> 00:50:13,876
How do you like
their house?

397
00:50:13,878 --> 00:50:15,945
Are you certain
they're overseas?

398
00:50:15,947 --> 00:50:22,685
For the next six months.

399
00:50:22,687 --> 00:50:25,087
You do know the code,
don't you?

400
00:50:25,089 --> 00:50:27,690
Max told me there was
an easy way to remember it.

401
00:50:27,692 --> 00:50:31,360
Obviously.

402
00:50:31,362 --> 00:50:32,928
Beethoven.

403
00:50:32,930 --> 00:50:34,730
- What?
- The code.

404
00:50:34,732 --> 00:50:37,767
It's 1812, after the overture.

405
00:50:40,138 --> 00:50:43,639
That's Tchaikovsky, you idiot.

406
00:51:37,027 --> 00:51:39,595
Shit.

407
00:51:39,597 --> 00:51:43,132
Lucy, have you got
any of my contacts here?

408
00:51:43,134 --> 00:51:45,968
<i>Yeah.</i>

409
00:51:45,970 --> 00:51:51,307
<i>In my toiletry bag.
I'll get it.</i>

410
00:51:54,111 --> 00:51:56,445
What's that?

411
00:51:56,447 --> 00:51:58,647
I was gonna tell you about it.

412
00:51:58,649 --> 00:52:04,487
I found it in her car when
I was waiting for you earlier.

413
00:52:04,489 --> 00:52:06,689
It just slipped my mind
with all that was going on.

414
00:52:06,691 --> 00:52:09,225
How much?

415
00:52:09,227 --> 00:52:14,230
About...$250,000.

416
00:52:14,232 --> 00:52:16,966
Quarter of a million dollars.

417
00:52:16,968 --> 00:52:20,136
And you just forgot about it?

418
00:52:20,138 --> 00:52:22,138
We didn't have to kill her,
did we?

419
00:52:22,140 --> 00:52:23,372
What are you talking about?!

420
00:52:23,374 --> 00:52:24,707
We could have used
that money to pay Bruce.

421
00:52:24,709 --> 00:52:27,076
By the time I found it,
we were already committed.

422
00:52:30,715 --> 00:52:34,583
Very convenient.

423
00:52:34,585 --> 00:52:36,552
Believe me,
there is nothing convenient

424
00:52:36,554 --> 00:52:40,055
about this mess
that you got us into!

425
00:52:40,057 --> 00:52:41,790
Hey.

426
00:52:41,792 --> 00:52:44,760
Hey.

427
00:52:44,762 --> 00:52:49,832
I'm sick and tired of
having barely enough.

428
00:52:49,834 --> 00:52:52,501
I want more.

429
00:52:52,503 --> 00:52:54,370
So should you.

430
00:53:04,981 --> 00:53:06,282
I'm off.

431
00:53:06,284 --> 00:53:09,418
Why?
Why do you have to leave?

432
00:53:09,420 --> 00:53:12,955
I'll come back
when I get a chance.

433
00:53:12,957 --> 00:53:14,924
Okay.

434
00:53:14,926 --> 00:53:17,259
Why are you taking that?

435
00:53:17,261 --> 00:53:19,795
I'll keep it safe.

436
00:53:49,560 --> 00:53:51,727
Hello, Jack.

437
00:53:51,729 --> 00:53:53,929
- You.
- Me.

438
00:53:59,502 --> 00:54:01,170
Is it done?

439
00:54:01,172 --> 00:54:02,905
I wouldn't be here
if it weren't.

440
00:54:02,907 --> 00:54:06,609
She's dead?

441
00:54:06,611 --> 00:54:09,511
- How'd you do it?
- Oh, easy there, Jack.

442
00:54:09,513 --> 00:54:11,380
The less you know, the better.

443
00:54:11,382 --> 00:54:13,015
That way, if people
start asking questions,

444
00:54:13,017 --> 00:54:15,751
you don't have to lie.

445
00:54:15,753 --> 00:54:18,454
- She's...
- Gone.

446
00:54:18,456 --> 00:54:20,322
Forever.

447
00:54:33,503 --> 00:54:37,706
You planning on drinking
yourself to death, Jack?

448
00:54:37,708 --> 00:54:39,341
Maybe.

449
00:54:39,343 --> 00:54:43,012
Your business is your own.

450
00:54:43,014 --> 00:54:47,783
As long as we're square.

451
00:54:47,785 --> 00:54:49,385
You got some proof for me?

452
00:54:49,387 --> 00:54:52,521
Or am I supposed to
just take your word?

453
00:54:52,523 --> 00:54:57,660
What, you don't trust me
anymore?

454
00:54:57,662 --> 00:54:59,561
I'd have thought you'd be glad
to be rid of her.

455
00:54:59,563 --> 00:55:01,397
Answer to all your problems.

456
00:55:01,399 --> 00:55:03,399
Despite what you think,

457
00:55:03,401 --> 00:55:06,168
I love my wife very much.

458
00:55:06,170 --> 00:55:07,503
Too much.

459
00:55:07,505 --> 00:55:10,372
Well, you've got
a crazy way of showing it.

460
00:55:10,374 --> 00:55:13,809
Nobody makes a fool out of me.

461
00:55:13,811 --> 00:55:17,880
It's gone.

462
00:55:17,882 --> 00:55:24,620
I don't like the sound of that.

463
00:55:24,622 --> 00:55:26,155
Alice.

464
00:55:26,157 --> 00:55:29,958
You wouldn't be playing games
with me, would you, Jack?

465
00:55:29,960 --> 00:55:31,560
What?

466
00:55:31,562 --> 00:55:33,262
No, don't worry. I have more.

467
00:55:33,264 --> 00:55:34,830
Where?

468
00:55:34,832 --> 00:55:38,033
At the safety deposit box
at the bank.

469
00:55:38,035 --> 00:55:41,503
Had me worried for a moment.

470
00:55:41,505 --> 00:55:45,207
What time shall I
come back tomorrow?

471
00:55:45,209 --> 00:55:46,475
Give me till 3:00.

472
00:55:46,477 --> 00:55:51,880
Let's make it 2:00.

473
00:55:51,882 --> 00:55:54,650
Jack, all this talk of booze
has got me quite thirsty.

474
00:55:54,652 --> 00:55:57,386
You wouldn't know of any good
bars in the area, would you?

475
00:57:37,887 --> 00:57:39,221
Shit.

476
00:57:51,067 --> 00:57:55,003
Hi, Bruce.

477
00:57:55,005 --> 00:57:57,973
Where's Lucy?

478
00:57:57,975 --> 00:58:01,543
Oh, she hasn't
showed up for work yet.

479
00:58:01,545 --> 00:58:04,246
You know why I'm here?

480
00:58:04,248 --> 00:58:05,647
Yeah.

481
00:58:05,649 --> 00:58:07,883
You said I had a week,
so that gives me at least...

482
00:58:07,885 --> 00:58:10,285
Don't play games.

483
00:58:10,287 --> 00:58:12,621
I'm here on police business.

484
00:58:12,623 --> 00:58:15,123
You know anything
about a crash?

485
00:58:15,125 --> 00:58:17,526
Up on Devil's Rocks Road?

486
00:58:17,528 --> 00:58:19,328
No. Should I?

487
00:58:19,330 --> 00:58:21,463
I didn't think
you had the balls, mate.

488
00:58:21,465 --> 00:58:22,998
What are you talking about?

489
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:26,068
I found Lucy's car,
or what's left of it.

490
00:58:27,470 --> 00:58:30,239
This thing has insurance job
written all over it.

491
00:58:34,544 --> 00:58:38,313
Don't bullshit me.

492
00:58:38,315 --> 00:58:41,216
You got a policy
in your wife's name?

493
00:58:41,218 --> 00:58:43,385
Yes.

494
00:58:43,387 --> 00:58:46,054
Well, one word from me
in the wrong man's ear

495
00:58:46,056 --> 00:58:49,858
and that claim won't clear
for a bloody long time.

496
00:58:49,860 --> 00:58:52,027
But I'm also in a position
to make this thing

497
00:58:52,029 --> 00:58:55,797
go your way without a hitch,
open and shut case.

498
00:58:55,799 --> 00:59:01,970
But for these services,
I need to be compensated.

499
00:59:01,972 --> 00:59:04,239
I'm listening.

500
00:59:04,241 --> 00:59:05,841
- I want half.
- Half?

501
00:59:05,843 --> 00:59:09,478
Mmm, half of what's left
after you settle your debts.

502
00:59:09,480 --> 00:59:12,714
No way!

503
00:59:12,716 --> 00:59:14,883
Consider your options, Nathan.

504
00:59:14,885 --> 00:59:17,753
Okay? I'm being very generous.
Don't insult me.

505
00:59:17,755 --> 00:59:19,888
You got a copy of your wife's
dental records?

506
00:59:19,890 --> 00:59:22,190
Hey? Save me a trip back here
after I ring this in.

507
00:59:22,192 --> 00:59:24,026
Yes.

508
00:59:30,800 --> 00:59:34,403
Here.

509
00:59:34,405 --> 00:59:37,239
I underestimated you, mate.

510
00:59:37,241 --> 00:59:40,175
Your own wife.

511
00:59:40,177 --> 00:59:42,911
You're a heartless fucker.

512
01:00:03,166 --> 01:00:06,134
Luce.

513
01:00:06,136 --> 01:00:07,803
Lucy!

514
01:00:17,047 --> 01:00:19,481
Lucy!

515
01:00:42,206 --> 01:00:45,440
Bit of a problem.

516
01:00:45,442 --> 01:00:47,209
Read this.

517
01:00:59,555 --> 01:01:01,356
When did you get this?

518
01:01:01,358 --> 01:01:04,526
Earlier.

519
01:01:04,528 --> 01:01:06,461
Do you have any idea
who sent it?

520
01:01:06,463 --> 01:01:09,364
No.

521
01:01:09,366 --> 01:01:12,501
Do you?

522
01:01:12,503 --> 01:01:15,504
What? Of course not.

523
01:01:15,506 --> 01:01:19,508
Two hundred
and fifty thousand dollars.

524
01:01:19,510 --> 01:01:21,043
Bit of a coincidence,
don't you think?

525
01:01:21,045 --> 01:01:24,379
The email says
he's watching us.

526
01:01:24,381 --> 01:01:25,447
He?

527
01:01:25,449 --> 01:01:27,282
Oh, you think it's a she?

528
01:01:27,284 --> 01:01:28,984
Maybe.

529
01:01:28,986 --> 01:01:32,154
- You're being ridiculous.
- Am I?

530
01:01:32,156 --> 01:01:36,391
Well, he or she, all they
mention here is 250 grand.

531
01:01:36,393 --> 01:01:37,759
So?

532
01:01:37,761 --> 01:01:39,594
So obviously they don't know
about the insurance policy

533
01:01:39,596 --> 01:01:41,496
or they'd be after a lot more.

534
01:01:41,498 --> 01:01:44,232
You think we should pay?

535
01:01:44,234 --> 01:01:48,003
Fuck.

536
01:01:48,005 --> 01:01:50,138
I think we have a chance
to end this cheap.

537
01:01:50,140 --> 01:01:51,606
Cheap?

538
01:01:51,608 --> 01:01:53,642
In comparison.

539
01:01:53,644 --> 01:01:57,379
Besides, I don't see
too many options.

540
01:01:57,381 --> 01:01:59,815
Maybe.

541
01:01:59,817 --> 01:02:02,517
You still have the money,
don't you?

542
01:02:02,519 --> 01:02:04,086
In the car.

543
01:02:04,088 --> 01:02:07,589
Why?

544
01:02:07,591 --> 01:02:10,292
Thought maybe you'd
gambled it away already.

545
01:02:10,294 --> 01:02:13,595
Don't start.

546
01:02:13,597 --> 01:02:15,597
- You coming?
- Where?

547
01:02:15,599 --> 01:02:18,233
Where do you think?

548
01:02:18,235 --> 01:02:20,469
I'm dead, remember?

549
01:02:48,731 --> 01:02:49,765
Where is she?

550
01:02:49,767 --> 01:02:51,867
Come here.

551
01:03:04,781 --> 01:03:06,181
Who the fuck
do you think you are

552
01:03:06,183 --> 01:03:08,784
coming in here
accusing me of what, exactly?

553
01:03:08,786 --> 01:03:14,489
I want to know what you did.

554
01:03:14,491 --> 01:03:20,529
What about what<i> you</i> did?

555
01:03:22,266 --> 01:03:27,903
I had you followed.

556
01:03:27,905 --> 01:03:30,105
- I want my money back.
- What money?

557
01:03:30,107 --> 01:03:32,908
I know she took it,
I know she gave it to you,

558
01:03:32,910 --> 01:03:34,075
and I want it back.

559
01:03:34,077 --> 01:03:38,446
I haven't got your money.

560
01:03:38,448 --> 01:03:42,284
Is that right?

561
01:03:47,591 --> 01:03:49,791
You looking for this? Hmm?

562
01:03:53,497 --> 01:03:55,564
Where is she?

563
01:03:55,566 --> 01:03:59,568
You gonna shoot me?

564
01:03:59,570 --> 01:04:04,272
Just tell me where she is.

565
01:04:04,274 --> 01:04:07,108
Fuck you.

566
01:04:07,110 --> 01:04:09,611
Argh!

567
01:04:09,613 --> 01:04:12,314
Argh! Fuck!

568
01:04:12,316 --> 01:04:17,352
You fucking shot me!
You fucking prick!

569
01:04:17,354 --> 01:04:18,787
Where is she?!

570
01:04:18,789 --> 01:04:20,422
I don't know!

571
01:04:20,424 --> 01:04:22,290
He wouldn't tell me.

572
01:04:22,292 --> 01:04:25,427
The guy I hired.
The one who shot the video!

573
01:04:25,429 --> 01:04:27,796
- What's his fucking name?
- Wolfe! Charlie Wolfe!

574
01:04:27,798 --> 01:04:29,631
Where can I find him?

575
01:04:29,633 --> 01:04:32,734
Here, a little later.

576
01:04:32,736 --> 01:04:34,970
Why?

577
01:04:34,972 --> 01:04:40,575
He still has to get paid.

578
01:04:40,577 --> 01:04:45,580
Paid for what?

579
01:04:45,582 --> 01:04:50,085
Making her disappear.

580
01:04:58,094 --> 01:04:59,561
How will I recognize him?

581
01:04:59,563 --> 01:05:03,265
He drives a Toronado.

582
01:05:03,267 --> 01:05:07,335
- The tourist.
- Yeah, he's no tourist.

583
01:06:26,649 --> 01:06:28,850
So, how are we gonna do this?

584
01:06:28,852 --> 01:06:30,952
<i>Well, that's the easy part.</i>

585
01:06:30,954 --> 01:06:32,487
You just put the money
on the ground

586
01:06:32,489 --> 01:06:36,024
and then get in your car
and fuck off.

587
01:06:38,595 --> 01:06:40,462
<i>Not a chance.</i>

588
01:06:40,464 --> 01:06:42,864
<i>We do this face-to-face
or not at all.</i>

589
01:06:42,866 --> 01:06:46,067
You don't
get to call the shots.

590
01:06:46,069 --> 01:06:47,936
<i>You consider this
a down payment.</i>

591
01:06:47,938 --> 01:06:49,404
I'll keep the memory card

592
01:06:49,406 --> 01:06:51,706
until the insurance policy's
cleared.

593
01:06:51,708 --> 01:06:53,341
Over my dead body.

594
01:06:54,378 --> 01:06:56,411
Isn't that over
your wife's dead body?

595
01:06:56,413 --> 01:07:00,749
<i>You've got
a bad attitude.</i>

596
01:07:00,751 --> 01:07:03,051
Look, your money is here,

597
01:07:03,053 --> 01:07:05,253
and so am I
until you come and collect it.

598
01:07:05,255 --> 01:07:07,655
Or I could just shoot you
where you stand,

599
01:07:07,657 --> 01:07:09,357
come and take the money.

600
01:07:09,359 --> 01:07:10,859
<i>What,
and kill the only person</i>

601
01:07:10,861 --> 01:07:12,821
<i>that can claim
the insurance policy?</i>

602
01:07:13,997 --> 01:07:16,464
<i>I don't think so.</i>

603
01:07:16,466 --> 01:07:18,133
Ow! Argh!

604
01:07:18,135 --> 01:07:20,702
- Yes!
- Fuck!

605
01:07:36,018 --> 01:07:37,519
Fuck!

606
01:07:44,260 --> 01:07:49,330
You know,
I'd prefer not to kill you.

607
01:07:49,332 --> 01:07:51,599
But I will.

608
01:07:51,601 --> 01:07:54,569
Just so we're clear.

609
01:07:54,571 --> 01:07:55,637
This ends today.

610
01:07:55,639 --> 01:08:01,676
Whatever you say.

611
01:08:01,678 --> 01:08:03,778
Argh!

612
01:08:10,653 --> 01:08:14,622
God! Ow!

613
01:08:14,624 --> 01:08:18,660
Fuck!

614
01:08:24,401 --> 01:08:27,469
Argh! Ah!

615
01:08:30,173 --> 01:08:32,006
Do you find something funny?!

616
01:08:33,543 --> 01:08:35,810
You're a fucking lunatic!
You know that?

617
01:08:38,014 --> 01:08:40,315
- Look in the bag.
- Why?

618
01:08:41,918 --> 01:08:48,523
'Cause I want to see your face.

619
01:08:58,869 --> 01:09:02,237
That wife of yours.

620
01:09:02,239 --> 01:09:05,740
She's something, right?

621
01:09:05,742 --> 01:09:07,809
Leave her alone.

622
01:09:07,811 --> 01:09:12,814
Tell me where the fucking money
is or she eats this gun.

623
01:09:12,816 --> 01:09:14,082
If I tell you...

624
01:09:14,084 --> 01:09:16,918
Then I won't kill her.

625
01:09:16,920 --> 01:09:23,057
- Give me your word.
- I promise.

626
01:09:23,059 --> 01:09:29,230
It's in the boot.

627
01:09:29,232 --> 01:09:34,469
The keys are... in my pocket.

628
01:09:34,471 --> 01:09:38,540
- Argh!

629
01:10:10,272 --> 01:10:12,373
Now...
- Yeah?

630
01:10:12,375 --> 01:10:14,776
...I will be sure
to tell your wife

631
01:10:14,778 --> 01:10:16,644
what you tried to do for her.

632
01:10:16,646 --> 01:10:18,846
You promised me.

633
01:10:18,848 --> 01:10:21,382
- You promised...

634
01:10:36,031 --> 01:10:40,401
No.

635
01:10:40,403 --> 01:10:41,936
No!

636
01:10:41,938 --> 01:10:44,906
Argh!

637
01:12:26,608 --> 01:12:28,042
Jack?

638
01:12:36,185 --> 01:12:37,952
Jack?

639
01:12:40,923 --> 01:12:43,925
I could murder a drink.

640
01:12:53,535 --> 01:12:59,507
Despite how this looks,
I had nothing to do with it.

641
01:13:09,552 --> 01:13:11,552
Argh!

642
01:14:21,056 --> 01:14:25,626
Hey!
Hey! Hey!

643
01:14:42,344 --> 01:14:44,078
Dylan!

644
01:15:21,750 --> 01:15:23,985
Gah!

645
01:17:38,086 --> 01:17:41,122
Boo!

646
01:17:41,124 --> 01:17:45,393
Fuck!

647
01:17:45,395 --> 01:17:48,529
What the fuck
are you doing here?

648
01:17:48,531 --> 01:17:50,398
Dammit!

649
01:18:01,143 --> 01:18:03,110
What happened?

650
01:18:03,112 --> 01:18:05,346
He fucking stabbed me.

651
01:18:05,348 --> 01:18:07,515
What, Nathan?

652
01:18:07,517 --> 01:18:09,517
Yeah.
What a complete psycho.

653
01:18:09,519 --> 01:18:11,419
- But you got the money?
- Oh, I got it.

654
01:18:11,421 --> 01:18:13,054
Where's Nathan now?

655
01:18:13,056 --> 01:18:15,523
Yeah, about that.

656
01:18:15,525 --> 01:18:17,925
- What about it?
- Um...

657
01:18:23,298 --> 01:18:25,399
Did you fuck this up?

658
01:18:25,401 --> 01:18:28,202
Honey, I'm having
a bad day here.

659
01:18:28,204 --> 01:18:29,670
You killed him?

660
01:18:29,672 --> 01:18:31,005
He forced my hand.

661
01:18:31,007 --> 01:18:32,640
Do you realize
what you've done?

662
01:18:32,642 --> 01:18:35,242
It was him or me, okay?
Sorry.

663
01:18:35,244 --> 01:18:36,610
Dammit, Charlie!

664
01:18:36,612 --> 01:18:37,912
You wanted him dead.

665
01:18:37,914 --> 01:18:39,680
Yeah, after
the insurance settlement.

666
01:18:39,682 --> 01:18:41,782
What can I say?
The guy flipped.

667
01:18:41,784 --> 01:18:42,950
Un-fucking-believable.

668
01:18:42,952 --> 01:18:44,785
You had a simple job
and you fucked it up.

669
01:18:44,787 --> 01:18:46,620
Don't try to blame this on me.

670
01:18:46,622 --> 01:18:47,755
You're the one
who couldn't wait.

671
01:18:47,757 --> 01:18:50,658
You wanted the 250 now,
so I sorted it.

672
01:18:50,660 --> 01:18:52,259
Sorted it?

673
01:18:52,261 --> 01:18:54,795
You weren't meant to kill him,
you idiot!

674
01:18:54,797 --> 01:18:56,230
Watch your mouth.

675
01:18:56,232 --> 01:18:58,032
How the fuck do we get
the insurance money

676
01:18:58,034 --> 01:19:01,435
Thanks to your incompetence,
our plan's utterly ruined.

677
01:19:01,437 --> 01:19:04,205
That's just great, Charlie.

678
01:19:05,374 --> 01:19:07,508
Your husband might have
put up with your shit.

679
01:19:07,510 --> 01:19:10,745
Don't mistake me for him.

680
01:19:10,747 --> 01:19:13,347
Well, I'd like to say
it's been a pleasure.

681
01:19:13,349 --> 01:19:14,548
What do you mean?

682
01:19:14,550 --> 01:19:17,418
I'm leaving.

683
01:19:17,420 --> 01:19:19,253
Yeah, I'm coming with you.

684
01:19:19,255 --> 01:19:21,756
Not in this life.

685
01:19:21,758 --> 01:19:23,424
You can't just leave.

686
01:19:23,426 --> 01:19:27,194
What were you expecting?

687
01:19:27,196 --> 01:19:29,396
- But...
- What, because we fucked?

688
01:19:29,398 --> 01:19:33,634
Consider it a fringe benefit.

689
01:19:33,636 --> 01:19:36,203
We split the money first.

690
01:19:36,205 --> 01:19:38,139
No need to be greedy.

691
01:19:38,141 --> 01:19:41,008
You're about to inherit
the hotel.

692
01:19:41,010 --> 01:19:42,743
What are you talking about?

693
01:19:42,745 --> 01:19:44,178
You'll see.

694
01:19:44,180 --> 01:19:45,679
I'll see what?

695
01:19:45,681 --> 01:19:47,915
So long, honey.

696
01:19:47,917 --> 01:19:49,350
- Give me the card!
- What?

697
01:19:49,352 --> 01:19:51,519
The card! The memory card
from the camera.

698
01:19:51,521 --> 01:19:53,320
Give it to me!

699
01:19:54,857 --> 01:19:56,791
You are either the craziest
or the cleverest bitch

700
01:19:56,793 --> 01:19:58,626
I have ever met.

701
01:19:58,628 --> 01:20:04,298
I can't decide.

702
01:20:07,103 --> 01:20:09,170
Ow!

703
01:20:09,172 --> 01:20:11,539
What the fuck?!

704
01:20:11,541 --> 01:20:13,073
Dylan, what are you doing here?

705
01:20:13,075 --> 01:20:14,542
I could ask you the same thing.

706
01:20:14,544 --> 01:20:19,880
God, this place is like a
fucking open-air insane asylum!

707
01:20:19,882 --> 01:20:21,882
- Is this what you did it for?
- Did what?

708
01:20:21,884 --> 01:20:24,151
Don't play dumb.
Jack filled me in on your deal.

709
01:20:24,153 --> 01:20:25,853
No, look,
you've got it all wrong.

710
01:20:25,855 --> 01:20:28,589
- Don't fucking lie.
- I didn't touch her.

711
01:20:28,591 --> 01:20:31,826
He's lying. He did it.
He killed Alice.

712
01:20:31,828 --> 01:20:33,594
You fucking snake!

713
01:20:33,596 --> 01:20:35,596
And he killed Nathan.

714
01:20:35,598 --> 01:20:39,867
Look, if you want to know
who killed Alice, she did.

715
01:20:39,869 --> 01:20:41,602
Dylan, I swear to God...

716
01:20:41,604 --> 01:20:43,037
Look, I can prove it.

717
01:20:43,039 --> 01:20:49,410
- He's lying!
- Shut the fuck up!

718
01:20:49,412 --> 01:20:50,978
I know you killed her.

719
01:20:50,980 --> 01:20:53,214
She's dead, and so are you.

720
01:20:56,786 --> 01:20:59,386
Nice shot!

721
01:20:59,388 --> 01:21:02,523
I...

722
01:21:15,937 --> 01:21:20,341
Argh!

723
01:21:20,343 --> 01:21:21,809
Fuck's sake.

724
01:21:27,717 --> 01:21:29,416
Time we put you
out of your misery.

725
01:21:29,418 --> 01:21:33,520
Argh!

726
01:21:33,522 --> 01:21:35,789
Argh!

727
01:21:35,791 --> 01:21:39,660
No, no! No! No!

728
01:22:14,629 --> 01:22:16,430
I took the money.

729
01:22:16,432 --> 01:22:18,232
I know.

730
01:22:30,245 --> 01:22:33,113
What?

731
01:23:33,875 --> 01:23:37,144
Yeah?

732
01:23:37,146 --> 01:23:42,983
I'll be there in an hour.

733
01:23:42,985 --> 01:23:44,818
Better make that two.

734
01:23:46,622 --> 01:23:49,623
Fuck's sake.
