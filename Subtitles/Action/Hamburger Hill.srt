Mister Nathaniel Victor

365
00:23:02,714 --> 00:23:05,341
Some of you think you have problems
cos you're against the war.

366
00:23:05,467 --> 00:23:08,177
You demonstrated in school,
you wear peace symbols on your steel,

367
00:23:08,303 --> 00:23:09,637
and you have attitudes.

368
00:23:12,557 --> 00:23:16,227
l'm an orphan, my brother's queer,

the incurable crud,

371
00:23:20,273 --> 00:23:23,275
and the draft ruined my chances
of being a brain surgeon.

372
00:23:23,402 --> 00:23:25,694
People, you have no problem...

373
00:23:28,115 --> 00:23:29,532

"Motown, you got these people fooled."

of the nine known strains of syphilis
and/or gonorrhoea

470

00:46:52,392 --> 00:46:53,893
- Yes.
- OΚ.

696
00:46:54,019 --> 00:46:56,604
And that other guy
and Alphabet the day before.

697
00:46:56,730 --> 00:46:57,647
Thank you, sir.

698
00:46:57,773 --> 00:47:00,107
Ηey, guys, check this out.

699
00:47:01,401 --> 00:47:03,402
l love this Camaro.

700
00:47:03,529 --> 00:47:05,613
- It's you.
- lt's a rod, man.

701
00:47:05,739 --> 00:47:07,156
(Ηelicopter overhead)

702
00:47:15,541 --> 00:47:17,083
We did good today, didn't we?

703
00:47:19,086 --> 00:47:22,129
We got our cherries busted today,
didn't we, Sarge?

704
00:47:25,467 --> 00:47:28,803
One of my people got killed.

705
00:47:28,929 --> 00:47:31,347
That's all that happened today.

706
00:47:33,267 --> 00:47:35,059
(Distant explosions)

707
00:47:36,562 --> 00:47:40,523
You knew that man wasn't gonna slack off
because he was short.

708
00:47:42,568 --> 00:47:45,069
You knew that brother was gonna do his job.

709
00:47:45,195 --> 00:47:47,613
Then why didn't you put him on profile?

710
00:47:47,739 --> 00:47:50,408
Because he is one healthy individual.

711
00:47:50,534 --> 00:47:55,079
I got people in this fucking platoon that are
so sick they wouldn't be allowed in the hospital.

712
00:47:55,205 --> 00:47:57,999
But out here they have to ruck up,
move out, and press on!

713
00:47:59,084 --> 00:48:02,295
Doc, it don't mean nothing, man.
It don't mean nothing.

714
00:48:05,549 --> 00:48:08,050
Come on, man.
You owe it to yourself.

715
00:48:09,136 --> 00:48:10,845
Yourself.

716
00:48:19,229 --> 00:48:22,815
lt don't mean nothing.
Not a thing, man.

717
00:48:22,941 --> 00:48:25,151
lt don't mean nothing.
Not a thing.

718
00:48:25,277 --> 00:48:26,736
Not a thing.

719
00:48:26,862 --> 00:48:30,239
lt don't mean nothing.
Not a thing.

720
00:48:30,365 --> 00:48:32,241
lt don't mean nothing.

721
00:48:32,367 --> 00:48:34,327
Not a thing.

722
00:48:34,453 --> 00:48:35,870
lt don't mean nothing.

723
00:48:35,996 --> 00:48:37,288
(Both) Not a thing.

724
00:48:37,414 --> 00:48:39,624
lt don't mean nothing.

725
00:48:39,750 --> 00:48:40,958
Not a thing.

726
00:48:41,084 --> 00:48:42,960
lt don't mean nothing.

727
00:48:43,086 --> 00:48:44,045
Not a thing.

728
00:48:44,171 --> 00:48:45,171
Right.

729
00:48:45,297 --> 00:48:46,964
lt don't mean nothing, brother.

730
00:48:47,090 --> 00:48:48,341
(All) Not a thing.

731
00:48:48,467 --> 00:48:50,217
lt don't mean nothing, man.

732
00:48:50,344 --> 00:48:51,844
Not a thing.

733
00:48:51,970 --> 00:48:52,887
All right.

734
00:48:53,013 --> 00:48:54,305
- Not a thing.
- Not a thing.

735
00:48:56,683 --> 00:48:57,934
Nothing, man.

736
00:48:58,060 --> 00:48:58,935
Ηuh?

737
00:48:59,061 --> 00:49:00,436
All right.

738
00:49:00,562 --> 00:49:01,520
Not a thing.

739
00:49:01,647 --> 00:49:02,521
Nothing.

740
00:49:02,648 --> 00:49:03,814
Not a goddamn thing.

741
00:49:08,570 --> 00:49:09,946
(Distant explosions)

742
00:49:10,822 --> 00:49:13,115
We got, uh...

743
00:49:13,241 --> 00:49:16,243
We got McDaniel's body
out on a trolley chopper.

744
00:49:20,666 --> 00:49:24,043
All he wanted to do
was go home in his jump boots.

745
00:49:27,172 --> 00:49:29,298
Couldn't believe they'd call him a jerk.

746
00:49:30,550 --> 00:49:32,385
And worse.

747
00:49:32,511 --> 00:49:33,803
Worse.

748
00:49:35,681 --> 00:49:36,889
Well...

749
00:49:38,850 --> 00:49:40,726
you know, people get hurt out here.

750
00:49:40,852 --> 00:49:41,894
Oh, come on!

751
00:49:42,020 --> 00:49:45,314
Don't tell me he died for God, country,
and the 1 01st Airborne Division.

752
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:48,693
l'd never say that shit to anybody.

753
00:49:49,695 --> 00:49:51,278
McDaniel's didn't die for anything.

754
00:49:51,405 --> 00:49:53,406
Didn't leave his goddamn guts
on a goddamn trail

755
00:49:53,532 --> 00:49:59,370
in the goddamn Ashau Valley
for home town, medal, or any of that bullshit.

756
00:50:02,082 --> 00:50:04,041
Flanked his automatic weapon
and took it out,

757
00:50:04,167 --> 00:50:06,836
for you and for 3rd Squad.

758
00:50:06,962 --> 00:50:09,463
Man, don't you give him anything less.

759
00:50:11,842 --> 00:50:14,260
When we get out of this valley,
Worcester...

760
00:50:15,595 --> 00:50:17,054
l'm gonna kick your ass.

761
00:50:21,143 --> 00:50:24,937
Battalion wants us to go back
to where Frantz made contact today.

762
00:50:25,063 --> 00:50:29,066
They say there are some stragglers
on this area, Ηill 937.

763
00:50:29,192 --> 00:50:32,028
Those ΚlAs were clean and well-equipped.
They weren't stragglers.

764
00:50:32,154 --> 00:50:33,946
Military lntelligence says there's no...

765
00:50:34,072 --> 00:50:36,157
Military Intelligence
could fuck up a wet dream.

766
00:50:36,283 --> 00:50:39,326
All right, men, just cool it,
we're on the same side here, all right?

767
00:50:39,453 --> 00:50:43,122
We'll just get our people quietly off this hill.
Tomorrow morning, we'll recon 937,

768
00:50:43,248 --> 00:50:47,168
call in a log bird for hot chow
and clean socks.

769
00:50:47,294 --> 00:50:48,502
lsn't that right, Lieutenant?

770
00:50:48,628 --> 00:50:49,628
- Roger that.
- Right.

771
00:50:49,755 --> 00:50:50,629
No.

772
00:50:50,756 --> 00:50:52,423
Murphy's calling in.

773
00:50:52,549 --> 00:50:55,634
8-2-9 Delta Tango's GTL-1
on November side,

774
00:50:55,761 --> 00:50:57,136
comma feature, same-same.

775
00:50:57,262 --> 00:51:00,598
Squad leaders, make sure
your people have dry socks,

776
00:51:00,724 --> 00:51:04,310
clean water, salt pills,
beaucoup ammo, just in case.

777
00:51:08,273 --> 00:51:10,941
All right, gather around.
Come on, listen up.

778
00:51:14,446 --> 00:51:17,615
At 0800 hours
we're going back in.

781
00:51:36,635 --> 00:51:39,470
All right, we're getting
TT small arms from up there.

782
00:51:39,596 --> 00:51:41,430
Blackjack wants us
to mop up any stragglers.

783
00:51:41,556 --> 00:51:43,349
1st and 2nd Squad
will move out from here.

784
00:51:43,475 --> 00:51:46,685
I want you to take your people,
move them in a flanking position.

785
00:51:46,812 --> 00:51:50,356
Spank the levers out of these
sorry-ass bastards. OΚ, let's move it.

786
00:51:52,776 --> 00:51:55,694
2nd Squad, move out!

787
00:51:55,821 --> 00:51:57,863
- 1st Squad, move out.
- (Grunts)

788
00:51:57,989 --> 00:52:01,200
Τhis isn't the plan we worked out, man.
We're supposed to go up that other hill.

789
00:52:01,326 --> 00:52:03,327
lt's the same old shit, man.

790
00:52:03,453 --> 00:52:05,955
The man in the bird wants to play war.

791
00:52:15,674 --> 00:52:17,550
- (Εxplosion)
- Take cover!

792

(Εxplosions)

793
00:52:22,264 --> 00:52:23,681
Argh!

794
00:52:24,307 --> 00:52:26,100
(Shouts of pain)

795
00:52:26,226 --> 00:52:27,643
(Sustained gunfire)

796
00:52:32,858 --> 00:52:36,569

801

Take your weapons forward,
and lay your covering fire over our friendlies!

802
00:52:56,882 --> 00:52:58,716
- Yes, sir!
- Move, move, move!

803
00:52:59,926 --> 00:53:03,596
Put your rounds 75 metres down.

804
00:53:03,722 --> 00:53:06,056
- (Gunfire)
- (Man screaming)

805
00:53:12,564 --> 00:53:14,064
That's where l want it.

806
00:53:14,191 --> 00:53:15,524

Never happen.

813
00:54:27,597 --> 00:54:29,974
Ηey, Languilli, remember in basic

814
00:54:30,100 --> 00:54:32,393
they told us we had to cover an eye
in case a flare goes,

815
00:54:32,519 --> 00:54:34,645
- so we don't lose our night vision?
- Τhey said that.

816
00:54:34,771 --> 00:54:36,647
OΚ, so what do you think they meant?

817
00:54:36,773 --> 00:54:39,483
Does it matter if we...
which eye we cover?

818
00:54:39,609 --> 00:54:41,819
Do you want the good eye
for the night vision,

819
00:54:41,945 --> 00:54:43,487
or do you want it for the flare?

820
00:54:43,613 --> 00:54:46,365
Beletsky, do you stay awake at night

821
00:54:46,491 --> 00:54:48,575

00:55:07,387 --> 00:55:09,555
- Yeah.
- You hear anything?

826
00:55:09,681 --> 00:55:10,597
Nothing.

827
00:55:10,724 --> 00:55:14,143
Camp on the Delta Darlings
for same-same negative sit-rep.

828
00:55:14,269 --> 00:55:16,103
Looks like we're getting out of here tomorrow.

829
00:55:16,229 --> 00:55:20,357
l'm going straight to the PX
and ordering that Firebird.

830
00:55:20,483 --> 00:55:22,151

(Distant explosions)

834
00:55:37,834 --> 00:55:39,293
Push in to the bullshit net.

835
00:55:39,419 --> 00:55:41,587
What's the bullshit net?

836
00:55:41,713 --> 00:55:44,882
Ηanoi Ηannah -
best sounds in the valley,

837
00:55:45,008 --> 00:55:46,717
and boy, does she have a rap.

838
00:55:46,843 --> 00:55:48,344
"We love you too much."

839
00:55:48,470 --> 00:55:51,889
"Drop your weapons and Uncle Ηo
will give you a water buffalo

840
00:55:52,015 --> 00:55:55,351
"and your own rice paddy to shit in."

841
00:55:57,103 --> 00:56:01,482
Sometimes they get American assholes

842
00:56:01,608 --> 00:56:03,525
(Radio) This is Red 6 Alpha. Roger. Out.

00:56:13,119 --> 00:56:15,537
like many of your heroic countrymen.

00:56:15,663 --> 00:56:16,705
(Εxplosion)

848
00:56:16,831 --> 00:56:21,043
Why fight the heroic People's Army
while your own government betrays you

849
00:56:21,169 --> 00:56:23,587
and the heroic American friends
of Vietnam?

850
00:56:23,713 --> 00:56:26,465
lf you have to smoke at night,
put a poncho over your head.

851
00:56:26,591 --> 00:56:28,926

00:56:56,454 --> 00:56:58,956
Ηow am I supposed

Ponchos over your head,

And now? Now this bullshit.

866
00:57:17,392 --> 00:57:19,935
And the whole time,
l'm worried l might forget something.

867
00:57:21,229 --> 00:57:22,604
(Εxplosion)

868
00:57:32,657 --> 00:57:34,074
(Ηelicopter)

869
00:57:48,882 --> 00:57:52,009
All right, on your feet. Wake up.
lt's time to earn your combat pay.

870
00:57:52,135 --> 00:57:54,178
l thought we were pulling off this hill today.

871
00:57:54,304 --> 00:57:56,638
- Don't think.
- Ηey, Motown, fuck you.

872
00:57:56,764 --> 00:57:59,391
- l need some goddamn boots, Sarge.
- My back!

873
00:57:59,517 --> 00:58:01,977
- My whole fucking body hurts.
- My dick hurts!

874
00:58:02,103 --> 00:58:05,856
Then drop ten and beat it.
l don't want to hear any more of this shit.

875
00:58:05,982 --> 00:58:10,444
Now you get your head out of your asses.
Blackjack wants us to take this hill.

876
00:58:10,570 --> 00:58:12,946
What's he gonna do with it?

877
00:58:15,533 --> 00:58:18,327
Pave it and turn it into a goddamn parking lot.

878
00:58:18,453 --> 00:58:20,621
Now move out.

879
00:58:22,582 --> 00:58:25,000
- (Gunfire and explosions)
- Argh!

880
00:58:34,385 --> 00:58:37,387
Cold Steel, Cold Steel,

881
00:58:37,514 --> 00:58:40,307
Tell 6 Action that the little bastards

882
00:58:40,433 --> 00:58:42,935
and to give us some goddamn fire support.

883
00:58:43,061 --> 00:58:45,646
Cold Steel, Cold Steel,

884
00:58:46,189 --> 00:58:47,606
(Εxplosions)

885
00:58:47,732 --> 00:58:48,607
Come in, 2-0.

886
00:58:48,733 --> 00:58:51,735
Get our dead and wounded out,
suppress the fire from that bunker line.

887
00:58:51,861 --> 00:58:53,237
- Beaucoup conflict.
- No shit.

888
00:58:53,363 --> 00:58:55,197
Worcester, move these men up.

889
00:58:55,323 --> 00:58:56,782
Men, go.

890
00:58:56,908 --> 00:58:59,201
Move it out, move it out!

891
00:58:59,327 --> 00:59:01,078
(Sustained gunfire)

892
00:59:02,956 --> 00:59:04,373

(Man shouts)
No fooling now, you motherfuckers!

895
00:59:15,969 --> 00:59:16,927

Argh!

906

You're mine, motherfucker!

907

908
01:00:16,779 --> 01:00:18,405
(Grunting)

909
01:00:23,453 --> 01:00:28,248
Argh!

You fucking shit!

911

(Εxplosions)

915
01:00:49,145 --> 01:00:52,022
Secure this area, Motown!
Cover that right flank!

916
01:00:52,148 --> 01:00:54,524
Gaigin, set up that gun!

917
01:00:54,651 --> 01:00:57,903
- Duffy needs a medic!
- Where's Doc?

918
01:00:59,322 --> 01:01:02,783
Get Worcester on the horn
and tell him we got his goddamn bunker!

919
01:01:02,909 --> 01:01:04,701
Get Worcester on the horn!

920
01:01:04,827 --> 01:01:06,161

921
01:01:06,287 --> 01:01:08,163
1-6 Charlie!

922
01:01:09,332 --> 01:01:11,708
This is 1-6 Alpha! Over!

923
01:01:11,834 --> 01:01:14,169
Bunker line is taken and secure!

924
01:01:14,295 --> 01:01:16,046
Can you hear me?

925
01:01:16,172 --> 01:01:18,173
Come on, get Duffy down here!

926
01:01:18,299 --> 01:01:21,760
Duffy, ain't nothing wrong with you.
Get in there!

927
01:01:22,845 --> 01:01:25,305
Talk to me!

928
01:01:27,225 --> 01:01:28,725
Say Alphabet!

929
01:01:28,851 --> 01:01:30,644

934
01:02:02,051 --> 01:02:03,093
Sarge.

935
01:02:04,470 --> 01:02:08,181
l asked everybody, who got the dink
that was on me and Numb-nuts.

936
01:02:08,307 --> 01:02:10,600
Nobody did it.

937
01:02:10,727 --> 01:02:11,601
Did you?

938
01:02:11,728 --> 01:02:14,104
Maybe he died of natural causes.

939
01:02:14,230 --> 01:02:15,230
(Laughs)

940
01:02:17,233 --> 01:02:18,984
Ηalf his head was blown away.

941
01:02:19,110 --> 01:02:23,238
- Sounds like a natural cause to me.
- When can you get him out of here?

942
01:02:25,158 --> 01:02:29,453
There are beaucoup fucked-up dudes
from the 2nd Squad ahead of Duffy.

943
01:02:29,579 --> 01:02:31,955
Ηey, it don't mean nothing.

944
01:02:33,541 --> 01:02:35,417
Where's my weapon?

945
01:02:36,627 --> 01:02:38,044

(Shouting in Vietnamese)

949
01:03:10,787 --> 01:03:13,455
Red 6, be advised
we have taken the bunker

950
01:03:13,581 --> 01:03:15,415
and are preparing to move up the hill.

951
01:03:15,541 --> 01:03:16,541
All right, Worcester.

952
01:03:16,667 --> 01:03:19,169
(Radio) 1-6, you're falling behind.

953
01:03:27,595 --> 01:03:32,015
Let's move, people,
and take this fucking hill.

954
01:03:32,141 --> 01:03:34,184
All right, let's go.

955
01:03:34,310 --> 01:03:36,311
(Gunfire and shouting)

956
01:04:11,514 --> 01:04:12,889

01:04:23,067 --> 01:04:24,401
(Εxplosion)

959
01:04:24,527 --> 01:04:25,527
Oh!

960
01:04:29,615 --> 01:04:31,324
Motherfucker.

961
01:04:31,450 --> 01:04:34,327
Let's see what you got!

962
01:04:34,453 --> 01:04:35,871
(Sustained gunfire)

963
01:04:37,456 --> 01:04:40,584
Ammo!
Gaigs, give me some ammo!

964
01:04:42,086 --> 01:04:44,921

965

966
01:04:51,262 --> 01:04:53,597

967
01:04:53,723 --> 01:04:55,724
(Εxplosions)

968
01:05:02,148 --> 01:05:03,565
No!

969
01:05:05,151 --> 01:05:06,735
(Speaking in Vietnamese)

970
01:05:07,820 --> 01:05:09,779
(Gunfire and shouting)

971
01:05:20,499 --> 01:05:21,833
(Gunfire)

972
01:05:21,959 --> 01:05:23,126
No!

973
01:05:23,252 --> 01:05:25,754
No, cease fire!

974
01:05:29,175 --> 01:05:32,135
Ηold it up! Τhey're firing

975
01:05:32,261 --> 01:05:33,678
(Gunfire)

976
01:05:36,933 --> 01:05:38,433
Cease fire!

977
01:05:39,393 --> 01:05:41,353
Call them in!

978
01:05:41,479 --> 01:05:42,771
God damn it!

979
01:05:44,899 --> 01:05:47,943
Stop! Call them in,
God damn it!

980
01:05:48,945 --> 01:05:51,279
Jesus Christ!

981
01:06:17,014 --> 01:06:18,473
(Sobs)

982
01:06:48,004 --> 01:06:49,421
(Εxplosions)

983
01:07:02,685 --> 01:07:05,812
Τhey said they were gonna
try and resupply us later today.

984
01:07:09,442 --> 01:07:11,234
Get Six-pack on the horn.

985
01:07:11,360 --> 01:07:13,403
Tell him...

986
01:07:13,529 --> 01:07:18,533
Τell him my people need
food and water now, not later, all right?

987
01:07:18,659 --> 01:07:19,701
OΚ.

988
01:07:20,828 --> 01:07:25,415

Can l look at the map?

991
01:07:28,294 --> 01:07:31,963
Request immediate, immediate resupply
of potable water and C rations.

992
01:07:32,089 --> 01:07:35,759
- Let's take a look at that map, Sergeant.
- Same coordinates as previous. Over.

993
01:07:35,885 --> 01:07:37,927
(Radio) This is Red 6. Roger.

994
01:07:38,054 --> 01:07:39,345
Sergeant.

995
01:07:44,852 --> 01:07:47,312
We're in the Ashau Valley,

996
01:07:47,438 --> 01:07:51,900
and we ain't going nowhere
except back up that goddamn hill.

997
01:07:58,074 --> 01:07:59,908
l'll get you a map.

998
01:08:04,497 --> 01:08:05,413
OΚ, here it is.

999
01:08:05,539 --> 01:08:07,040
Take that out of there.

1000
01:08:07,166 --> 01:08:11,086
You put the tape in there,
and you press that button.

1001
01:08:12,296 --> 01:08:13,963
lt's from my girl, Claire.

1002
01:08:14,090 --> 01:08:15,590
Just don't use all my juice.

1003
01:08:18,594 --> 01:08:22,180
Now, that's immoral,
unjust, and illegal.

1004
01:08:22,306 --> 01:08:23,223
Get this, Bienie.

1005
01:08:23,349 --> 01:08:24,516
What?

1006
01:08:26,143 --> 01:08:29,437
- Oh, my God, they're huge!
- (Both laugh)

1007
01:08:29,563 --> 01:08:32,607
She likes to lie naked on the beach

1008
01:08:32,733 --> 01:08:35,151
and have her boyfriend
read The Prophet to her.

1009
01:08:35,277 --> 01:08:38,113
Oh, yeah, he's probably
a long-haired, four-eyed faggot.

1010
01:08:38,239 --> 01:08:40,824
(Girl) l just don't know what to say.

1011
01:08:40,950 --> 01:08:44,744
l don't know what time it is where you are.

1012
01:08:44,870 --> 01:08:48,957
"l like to wrap his long hair
around my body

1013
01:08:49,083 --> 01:08:51,793
"while he makes love to me all night long."

1014
01:08:51,919 --> 01:08:54,629
(Girl) l had dinner with your Mom and Dad.

1015
01:08:54,755 --> 01:08:58,508
We read all your letters
and looked at the pictures you sent.

1016
01:08:58,634 --> 01:09:01,136
She became his love prisoner.

1017
01:09:01,262 --> 01:09:02,971
She would do anything for him.

1018
01:09:03,097 --> 01:09:07,183
Jesus Christ, I'm never gonna get
another haircut as long as l fucking live.

1019
01:09:07,309 --> 01:09:12,647
lf you can, Joe,
try to smile more in the pictures.

1020
01:09:12,773 --> 01:09:14,774
lt would help your mother.

1021
01:09:14,900 --> 01:09:17,193
Your dad didn't say much.

1022
01:09:17,319 --> 01:09:19,821
We both know what he's like.

1023
01:09:19,947 --> 01:09:24,159
But Katherine says
he gets up early every morning

1024
01:09:24,285 --> 01:09:26,411
and watches the news,

1025
01:09:26,537 --> 01:09:30,039
and he eats his dinner
in front of the TV at night.

1026
01:09:30,166 --> 01:09:32,333
l think he's looking for you.

1027
01:09:32,459 --> 01:09:35,587
l'm glad you have
such good friends like,

1028
01:09:35,713 --> 01:09:39,048
like Bienstock
and, and Langarelli.

1029
01:09:39,175 --> 01:09:40,258
Languilli.

1030
01:09:40,384 --> 01:09:42,093
Galvan and Frantz.

1031
01:09:46,348 --> 01:09:49,809
l want you to know one thing.

1032
01:09:49,935 --> 01:09:52,520
l'll always be true to you.

1033
01:09:52,646 --> 01:09:55,106
l'll wait for you.

1034
01:09:55,232 --> 01:09:58,443
l know it must be very difficult
for you over there,

1035
01:09:58,569 --> 01:10:02,530
and if you can't be true,

1036
01:10:02,656 --> 01:10:04,407
if you can't wait,

1037
01:10:04,533 --> 01:10:06,409
l'll understand.

1038
01:10:06,535 --> 01:10:09,495
l know you love me.

1039
01:10:09,622 --> 01:10:11,122
l love this woman.

1040
01:10:11,248 --> 01:10:13,374
She's telling him to get laid.

1041
01:10:16,670 --> 01:10:19,214
(Girl) l wish you weren't there.

1042
01:10:19,340 --> 01:10:22,091
l wish none of you were there.

1043
01:10:23,219 --> 01:10:26,679
But l'm proud of you, Joe.

1044
01:10:26,805 --> 01:10:30,558
l just don't think it's fair
that everybody is back here

1045
01:10:30,684 --> 01:10:33,811
acting like nothing is going on.

1046
01:10:33,938 --> 01:10:36,147
Their lives are the same.

1047
01:10:36,273 --> 01:10:39,067
lt's just not fair.

1048
01:10:39,193 --> 01:10:43,863
And l don't believe what they say about you.

1049
01:10:43,989 --> 01:10:46,783
Anyhow,

1050
01:10:46,909 --> 01:10:51,496
l don't care
because l love all of you.

1051
01:10:51,622 --> 01:10:55,208
Especially you, my darling.

1052
01:10:55,334 --> 01:10:58,169
Especially you, my...

1053
01:11:01,423 --> 01:11:03,258
Take it easy with that.

1054
01:11:03,384 --> 01:11:05,635
l'll take it any way l can.

1055
01:11:05,761 --> 01:11:07,887
l told you not to use all the batteries.

1056
01:11:10,182 --> 01:11:12,558
lt's that goddamn nigger music you listen to.

1057
01:11:12,685 --> 01:11:13,935
You...

1058
01:11:17,022 --> 01:11:18,398
Ηold up! Come on, Doc!

1059
01:11:18,524 --> 01:11:19,399
Get off of him!

1060
01:11:19,525 --> 01:11:21,651
Alphabet, put that shovel down.

1061
01:11:23,487 --> 01:11:24,862
Now what's happening here?

1062
01:11:26,991 --> 01:11:28,866
War is happening.

1063
01:11:30,786 --> 01:11:32,495
Put that down.

1064
01:11:35,541 --> 01:11:36,958
(Gunfire and shouting)

1065
01:11:44,258 --> 01:11:45,883
(Εxplosions)

1066
01:11:47,720 --> 01:11:49,053
Argh!

1067
01:11:49,263 --> 01:11:50,555
Fuck! Oh, fuck!

1068
01:11:50,681 --> 01:11:52,724
Doc! Doc!

1069
01:11:52,850 --> 01:11:55,226
On my way, on my way.

1070
01:11:55,728 --> 01:11:57,228
Fuck.

1071
01:11:57,354 --> 01:11:58,271
Oh!

1072
01:11:58,397 --> 01:12:00,440
Oh, fuck.

1073
01:12:00,566 --> 01:12:01,691
ls that any better?

1074
01:12:04,320 --> 01:12:05,737
(Screams)

1075
01:12:05,863 --> 01:12:07,947
Come on, you can.
Come on, let's go.

1076
01:12:08,073 --> 01:12:10,074
Come on. Up.

1077
01:12:11,076 --> 01:12:12,410
Move, move, move.

1078
01:12:13,704 --> 01:12:15,079
Move, move.

1079
01:12:15,497 --> 01:12:17,123
(Sustained gunfire)

1080
01:12:30,346 --> 01:12:31,763
(Sniffs)

1081
01:12:36,268 --> 01:12:37,852
Smells good, doesn't it?

1082
01:12:37,978 --> 01:12:38,895
What's for lunch?

1083
01:12:39,021 --> 01:12:40,897
Franks and beans, beanie-weenies,

1084
01:12:41,023 --> 01:12:42,815
spaghetti and bull's balls,

1085
01:12:42,941 --> 01:12:44,609
more ham motherfuckers.

1086
01:12:44,735 --> 01:12:46,319
Murphy's Law.

1087
01:12:46,445 --> 01:12:48,571
l'm not eating that shit.

1088
01:12:50,491 --> 01:12:52,408
lt is definitely the 'vette.

1089
01:12:52,534 --> 01:12:54,327
You can't score in a 'vette.

1090
01:12:54,453 --> 01:12:59,415
Oh, man, will you stop finger fucking his dream
with your chicken-shit details?

1091
01:12:59,541 --> 01:13:03,461
Let me tell you something, Lin-ghoul-i.
I've boom-boomed at mama-san's,

1092
01:13:03,587 --> 01:13:05,505
at a garbage dump,
and under a deuce and a half

1093
01:13:05,631 --> 01:13:08,841
while girl-san read Life magazine
and sucked on a Pepsi.

1094
01:13:08,967 --> 01:13:10,510
You can score in a 'vette.

1095
01:13:10,636 --> 01:13:13,346
After this shit, man,
you owe it to yourself.

1096
01:13:13,472 --> 01:13:17,183
Ηey, Sarge, think they're gonna send us
some foot powder with that resupply?

1097
01:13:17,309 --> 01:13:19,769
Will you stop worrying about nothing,
for Christ's sake?

1098
01:13:19,895 --> 01:13:21,687
You'll go back to the world with bad feet.

1099
01:13:21,814 --> 01:13:24,107
What can they do to you,
send you to Vietnam?

1100
01:13:24,233 --> 01:13:26,859
I'm a salesman.
These feet are my life.

1101
01:13:26,985 --> 01:13:29,946
Look at this, man -
my goddamn skin's peeling off.

1102
01:13:30,072 --> 01:13:33,825
l think l've gone from 1 1 D to a 1 0C.

1103
01:13:36,203 --> 01:13:37,829
lt's from my girlfriend.

1104
01:13:42,292 --> 01:13:45,503
She says she's not
gonna write any more.

1105
01:13:48,173 --> 01:13:53,302
Friends at college
told her it was immoral to write to me.

1106
01:14:07,860 --> 01:14:09,235
Ohh!

1107
01:14:30,382 --> 01:14:31,799
(Sighs)

1108
01:14:38,432 --> 01:14:41,267
- (Εxplosions)
- Move it! Κeep it going!

1109
01:14:41,393 --> 01:14:42,768
Κeep up!

1110
01:14:42,895 --> 01:14:44,312
(Gunfire)

1111
01:14:46,815 --> 01:14:48,858
Die, you motherfuckers!

1112
01:14:51,862 --> 01:14:53,237
Ahh!

1113
01:14:54,072 --> 01:14:55,615
(Gunfire and explosions)

1114
01:14:56,074 --> 01:14:57,658
Doc!

1115
01:14:58,827 --> 01:15:01,913
Medic! Doc, get your
goddamn medic up here!

1116
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:06,292
Ηelp!

1117
01:15:06,418 --> 01:15:08,377
Gaigin, come on up!

1118
01:15:08,504 --> 01:15:10,796
Watching it, Sarge!

1119
01:15:10,923 --> 01:15:12,381
Shit!

1120
01:15:13,759 --> 01:15:15,134
Get the fucking medic up here!

1121
01:15:15,260 --> 01:15:17,720
- (Screams)
- Ηold on!

1122
01:15:17,846 --> 01:15:19,847
Get a medic up here!

1123
01:15:25,812 --> 01:15:28,606
They'll blow your brains out!
Let's go!

1124
01:15:28,732 --> 01:15:30,942
Κeep on! Move!

1125
01:15:31,068 --> 01:15:33,027
(Sustained gunfire)

1126
01:15:33,946 --> 01:15:36,531
- Go!
- Come on, guys, let's go!

1127
01:15:36,657 --> 01:15:38,741
Let's take this fucking hill!

1128
01:15:49,127 --> 01:15:50,962
OK, let's get ready.
Let's take this squad.

1129
01:15:51,088 --> 01:15:53,714
Teddy Ford. May 1 7th.

1130
01:15:56,969 --> 01:15:59,387
Ηow long have you been on this hill, soldier?

1131
01:16:01,515 --> 01:16:02,598
What?

1132
01:16:04,142 --> 01:16:05,601
Ηey, brother,

1133
01:16:05,727 --> 01:16:07,687
how many times you been
up and down this hill?

1134
01:16:07,813 --> 01:16:10,147
- What are you doing here?
- My job.

1135
01:16:10,274 --> 01:16:11,357
Bullshit.

1136
01:16:11,483 --> 01:16:15,027
We've been up and down this hill
nine fuckin' times.

1137
01:16:15,153 --> 01:16:18,239
Ηey, word down at Division is,
you guys can't take this hill.

1138
01:16:18,365 --> 01:16:20,199
What do you have to say about that?

1139
01:16:20,325 --> 01:16:24,912
ln fact, Senator Κennedy says
you guys don't have a chance at all.

1140
01:16:27,332 --> 01:16:30,251
You really like this shit, don't you?

1141
01:16:30,377 --> 01:16:31,711
lt's your job.

1142
01:16:31,837 --> 01:16:33,087
A story.

1143
01:16:33,213 --> 01:16:36,257
You're waiting here like a fucking vulture
waiting for somebody to die

1144
01:16:36,383 --> 01:16:38,050
- so you can take a picture.
- lt's my job.

1145
01:16:38,176 --> 01:16:40,595
I got more respect
for those little bastards up there.

1146
01:16:40,721 --> 01:16:43,055
At least they take a side.
You just take pictures.

1147
01:16:43,181 --> 01:16:45,391
You probably don't even
do your own fucking.

1148
01:16:45,517 --> 01:16:47,476
- No one asked my AO.
- What?

1149
01:16:47,603 --> 01:16:49,520
You listen to me.

1150
01:16:50,856 --> 01:16:53,608
We're gonna take this fucking hill,
newsman.

1151
01:16:54,860 --> 01:16:58,070
l see you on the top
taking pictures of any of my people,

1152
01:16:58,196 --> 01:17:01,157
l will blow your fucking head off.

1153
01:17:01,283 --> 01:17:05,119
Now, you haven't earned
the right to be here.

1154
01:17:05,245 --> 01:17:06,829
Do you understand that?

1155
01:17:09,708 --> 01:17:11,542
You understand that.

1156
01:17:17,132 --> 01:17:18,215
Watch it now.

1157
01:17:18,342 --> 01:17:19,550
Medic.

1158
01:17:26,892 --> 01:17:29,435
l should've gone to Canada.

1159
01:17:29,561 --> 01:17:31,646
All they got is Εskimos up there, Bienie.

1160
01:17:31,772 --> 01:17:34,607
The smart white people go to college.

1161
01:17:34,733 --> 01:17:35,775
Not me.

1162
01:17:35,901 --> 01:17:39,612
l'm doing my two years, getting married,
and forgetting all about this shit.

1163
01:17:39,738 --> 01:17:41,739
Never happen.

1164
01:17:41,865 --> 01:17:44,617
You people must be aware

1165
01:17:44,743 --> 01:17:47,078
that the brothers are here

1166
01:17:47,204 --> 01:17:51,290
because they cannot
afford an education.

1167
01:17:51,416 --> 01:17:52,833
What am l doing?

1168
01:17:52,959 --> 01:17:55,211
Sitting in some fucking country club

1169
01:17:55,337 --> 01:17:57,505
sipping on Seven and Sevens
and eating a steak?

1170
01:17:59,007 --> 01:18:02,259
You should take a look around.
l see all kinds of white faces here.

1171
01:18:02,386 --> 01:18:03,761
OΚ.

1172
01:18:05,430 --> 01:18:07,264
The war started for you...

1173
01:18:08,558 --> 01:18:10,685
- when you farted...
- (All laugh)

1174
01:18:10,811 --> 01:18:13,521
and said, "Good morning, Vietnam."

1175
01:18:13,647 --> 01:18:14,689
(All laugh)

1176
01:18:14,815 --> 01:18:17,316
See, now, l was born into this shit.

1177
01:18:17,442 --> 01:18:20,861
And they pulled the gold fucking spoon
out of my mouth so l could come here

1178
01:18:20,987 --> 01:18:24,490
and see how you low-class 1 1 boos live -
is that it?

1179
01:18:53,478 --> 01:18:56,897
- Brother blood.
- (All laugh)

1180
01:18:58,024 --> 01:18:59,900
Oh, God.

1181
01:19:00,026 --> 01:19:01,026
Scared you.

1182
01:19:01,153 --> 01:19:02,695
(All laugh)

1183
01:19:03,530 --> 01:19:05,448
Ηey, how'd you get here, Sarge?

1184
01:19:05,574 --> 01:19:06,741
Oh, the Sarge...

1185
01:19:06,867 --> 01:19:09,160
The Sarge volunteered
for this shit, right, Sarge?

1186
01:19:10,328 --> 01:19:11,871
No, man.

1187
01:19:11,997 --> 01:19:16,292
l was drafted and sworn in
and had my hair cut before l was sober.

1188
01:19:17,252 --> 01:19:19,962
Only reason l went Airborne is Collins.

1189
01:19:20,088 --> 01:19:21,839
Who the fuck is Collins?

1190
01:19:23,175 --> 01:19:24,633
Yeah.

1191
01:19:24,760 --> 01:19:26,844
We volunteered for the reality of it.

1192
01:19:26,970 --> 01:19:28,471
- Εxcuse me?
- Uh-oh!

1193
01:19:28,597 --> 01:19:30,014
(Laughter)

1194
01:19:31,850 --> 01:19:35,394
Don't you think I chased women
and a good time before l got into the machine?

1195
01:19:35,520 --> 01:19:37,062
- Yeah.
- No!

1196
01:19:37,189 --> 01:19:38,522
(All laugh)

1197
01:19:41,067 --> 01:19:44,612
When we got our orders
for the big puddle,

1198
01:19:44,738 --> 01:19:47,865
Collins says he's not going.

1199
01:19:47,991 --> 01:19:50,493
- And this one strike.
- You got to respect that.

1200
01:19:52,078 --> 01:19:53,829
No way.

1201
01:19:53,955 --> 01:19:56,248
lf you don't want to pull on the little people,

1202
01:19:56,374 --> 01:19:57,541
no sweat.

1203
01:19:57,667 --> 01:20:00,252
Don't use your weapon.

1204
01:20:00,378 --> 01:20:04,006
All l want from anybody is to get their ass
in the grass with the rest of us.

1205
01:20:05,383 --> 01:20:09,345
You don't have to like it,
but you have to show up.

1206
01:20:11,181 --> 01:20:13,474
Lord have mercy.

1207
01:20:14,726 --> 01:20:16,977
No FNGs, no war.

1208
01:20:17,103 --> 01:20:18,521
(Laughter)

1209
01:20:23,401 --> 01:20:24,693
There it is.

1210
01:20:24,820 --> 01:20:26,237
(All laugh)

1211
01:20:27,614 --> 01:20:28,989
(Sustained gunfire)

1212
01:20:46,633 --> 01:20:49,093
Medic! Doc!

1213
01:20:49,219 --> 01:20:51,679
- Doc!
- Doc!

1214
01:20:52,931 --> 01:20:54,348
Medic! Fuck!

1215
01:20:54,474 --> 01:20:55,850
(Εxplosions)

1216
01:20:57,060 --> 01:20:58,894
- (Gunshot)

1243

All right, let's get you straight.

1263
01:24:35,487 --> 01:24:38,280
You've got a good one, man.

1264
01:24:38,406 --> 01:24:40,532
You're going home.

1265
01:24:40,658 --> 01:24:41,658
See...

1266
01:24:42,702 --> 01:24:44,995
See you at home.

1267
01:24:50,335 --> 01:24:52,920
lt's all right, blood.

1268
01:24:53,046 --> 01:24:54,755
l don't feel a thing.

1269
01:24:54,881 --> 01:24:55,881
(All laugh)

1270
01:24:56,674 --> 01:25:00,385
l am beaucoup doped up.

1271
01:25:00,512 --> 01:25:02,554
Doc, now, come on now, Doc.

1272
01:25:02,680 --> 01:25:04,848
You owe this to yourself, all right?

1273
01:25:05,850 --> 01:25:08,519
Blackjack won't be happy,

1274
01:25:08,645 --> 01:25:11,605
till he gets all my people killed.

1275
01:25:11,731 --> 01:25:13,232
Ηow are you gonna act, man?

1276
01:25:13,358 --> 01:25:14,900
You're going back to the real world.

1277
01:25:15,026 --> 01:25:16,568
Going back, Doc.

1278
01:25:16,694 --> 01:25:19,404
l'm just what the world needs -

1279
01:25:20,365 --> 01:25:22,699
another nigger without a limb.

1280
01:25:22,826 --> 01:25:25,494
Now, come on, you stop that shit.

1281
01:25:25,620 --> 01:25:28,580
l'm not omitting you, blood.

1282
01:25:28,706 --> 01:25:31,291
We are all no-good

1283
01:25:31,417 --> 01:25:34,002
dumb niggers

1284
01:25:34,129 --> 01:25:35,462
on this hill,

1285
01:25:35,588 --> 01:25:37,756
blood...

1286
01:25:37,882 --> 01:25:40,759
and soul type.

1287
01:25:43,388 --> 01:25:46,223
But we're gonna fool them this time,
aren't we?

1288
01:25:46,349 --> 01:25:49,059
Fuckin' A, man.
Fuckin' A.

1289
01:25:49,185 --> 01:25:52,104
We've been up on that hill...

1290
01:25:52,230 --> 01:25:54,356
ten times,

1291
01:25:54,482 --> 01:25:56,984
and they still don't think we're serious.

1292
01:25:57,110 --> 01:25:58,235
No.

1293
01:25:59,737 --> 01:26:01,196
Who are we?

1294
01:26:01,322 --> 01:26:02,656
Doc, come on.

1295
01:26:02,782 --> 01:26:04,825
Come on.

1296
01:26:04,951 --> 01:26:06,743
Who are we?

1297
01:26:06,870 --> 01:26:07,953
We're the 1 01st.

1298
01:26:08,079 --> 01:26:09,997
Screaming Εagles, man.

1299
01:26:12,167 --> 01:26:14,209
You can bust this.

1300
01:26:15,920 --> 01:26:17,796
Take the hill.

1301
01:26:18,965 --> 01:26:21,425
And those bastards back in the world

1302
01:26:21,551 --> 01:26:23,177
can never take that from me.

1303
01:26:28,725 --> 01:26:30,434
Ηold on, man.

1304
01:26:33,021 --> 01:26:36,607
- Ηold on, man.
- Now, you hold on now, Doc.

1305
01:26:36,733 --> 01:26:38,150
Come on now.

1306
01:26:45,950 --> 01:26:47,284
(Sobs)

1307
01:26:47,410 --> 01:26:49,119
(Ηelicopter overhead)

1308
01:27:17,732 --> 01:27:19,316
(Distant explosions)

1309
01:27:28,243 --> 01:27:29,868
Save some for the old man.

1310
01:27:29,994 --> 01:27:33,538
Sir, can l buy you a cup of coffee?

1311
01:27:50,014 --> 01:27:53,517
Blackjack wants us
to manoeuvre aggressively.

1312
01:27:56,854 --> 01:28:00,565
l told him most of 1st Platoon
was still on the hill.

1313
01:28:05,113 --> 01:28:08,323
- We're not going anywhere, Sergeant.
- Drink your coffee, sir.

1314
01:28:13,454 --> 01:28:14,830
Why do you keep coming back?

1315
01:28:18,376 --> 01:28:21,920
Ask me that when...
when we're back in the world,

1316
01:28:22,046 --> 01:28:24,506
drinking cold beer
and chasing hot women.

1317
01:28:27,719 --> 01:28:29,011
Man.

1318
01:28:30,680 --> 01:28:32,556
When l get back,

1319
01:28:32,682 --> 01:28:34,933
l'm never leaving it again.

1320
01:28:35,059 --> 01:28:37,644
Flush toilets, hot showers...

1321
01:28:38,688 --> 01:28:40,188

pizza.

1322
01:28:41,983 --> 01:28:44,693
l want a corn dog with mustard.

1323
01:28:47,530 --> 01:28:49,865
l want some of that free love
l'm always hearing about.

1324
01:28:49,991 --> 01:28:52,576
Man, l'm always hearing about that.

1325
01:28:52,702 --> 01:28:54,911
lt's overrated.

1326
01:28:55,038 --> 01:28:59,041
Well, you're right about everybody
loving everybody back there, sir.

1327
01:28:59,167 --> 01:29:03,587
They...tattoo it to their foreheads,

1328
01:29:03,713 --> 01:29:06,673
and...they wear "Love" buttons

1329
01:29:06,799 --> 01:29:10,302
on their...flowered shirts, you know?

1330
01:29:10,428 --> 01:29:13,847
Yeah, they love everybody back there.

1331
01:29:13,973 --> 01:29:16,516
Cats, dogs...

1332
01:29:16,642 --> 01:29:18,602

niggers, spics,

1333
01:29:18,728 --> 01:29:21,897
kikes, wops, micks...

1334
01:29:23,066 --> 01:29:24,483
greaseballs.

1335
01:29:26,235 --> 01:29:28,653
Yeah, and they're real
fond of Luke the Gook back home.

1336
01:29:28,780 --> 01:29:30,614
Y'all can believe that.

1337
01:29:30,740 --> 01:29:33,533
They got a button for him, too.

1338
01:29:33,659 --> 01:29:34,826
Yeah.

1339
01:29:36,746 --> 01:29:38,997
They love everybody but you.

1340
01:29:43,920 --> 01:29:48,048
l was med-evac'd...after Dak To.

1341
01:29:50,259 --> 01:29:52,052
There was a hill.

1342
01:29:53,304 --> 01:29:56,598
And we were met at Oakland by...

1343
01:29:58,434 --> 01:30:00,477
pretty little things,
you know what l mean?

1344
01:30:00,603 --> 01:30:03,522
I mean, they had hair down
below their asses, you know.

1345
01:30:04,899 --> 01:30:07,901
And they had bags...

1346
01:30:09,821 --> 01:30:11,238
full of...

1347
01:30:12,365 --> 01:30:14,157
dog shit.

1348
01:30:17,328 --> 01:30:18,995
Well, don't mean nothing.

1349
01:30:19,122 --> 01:30:20,997
l'm back from the Nam, man.

1350
01:30:21,124 --> 01:30:22,999
Nothing ever gonna bother me again.

1351
01:30:23,126 --> 01:30:25,168
l get home.

1352
01:30:25,294 --> 01:30:29,005
Wife is sitting cross-legged on the floor.

1353
01:30:29,132 --> 01:30:31,842
Κids is running around barefoot.

1354
01:30:31,968 --> 01:30:35,137
There's a hair-head
taking a leak in the john.

1355
01:30:36,472 --> 01:30:38,557
"Sorry about that," l said.

1356
01:30:40,518 --> 01:30:42,978
That don't mean nothing, either.

1357
01:30:43,104 --> 01:30:46,314
l go down to Pauley's for a beer.

1358
01:30:46,441 --> 01:30:49,401
Old Man Finnegan's doing shooters.

1359
01:30:50,987 --> 01:30:53,905
The police's boy in the la Drang Valley,

1360
01:30:54,031 --> 01:30:57,534
sent him home in a rubber bag

1361
01:30:57,660 --> 01:31:00,328
with "Members Missing" stamped on it.

1362
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:06,084
Don't mean nothing.

1363
01:31:06,210 --> 01:31:09,421
Don't mean nothing except...

1364
01:31:12,008 --> 01:31:15,010
he keeps getting phone calls from these kids,

1365
01:31:15,136 --> 01:31:17,179
college kids...

1366
01:31:18,222 --> 01:31:21,099
saying how glad they was

1367
01:31:21,225 --> 01:31:24,561
that his boy was killed in Vietnam, Republic Of,

1368
01:31:24,687 --> 01:31:27,022
by the heroic People's Army.

1369
01:31:29,609 --> 01:31:32,444
They're sitting right on top of this fucking hill.

1370
01:31:37,033 --> 01:31:38,867
That's why l'm here.

1371

(Radio) Red 1-6, this is Blackjack 6.

1375
01:31:56,552 --> 01:31:59,012
You're getting paid to fight a war,
