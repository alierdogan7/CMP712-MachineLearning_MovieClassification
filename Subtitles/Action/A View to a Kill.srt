<i>Now we're all here
you can get on with the briefing, Q.</i>

77
00:10:49,732 --> 00:10:51,780
<i>Very good, sir.</i>

78
00:10:53,361 --> 00:10:55,113
<i>Gentlemen...</i>

79
00:10:55,738 --> 00:10:59,242
<i>A silicon integrated circuit:</i>

80

<i>the essential part of all modern computers.</i>

81
00:11:02,078 --> 00:11:05,127
<i>No lecture, Q.
We're all aware of the microchip.</i>

82
00:11:05,582 --> 00:11:10,338
<i>Until recently, all microchips
were susceptible to damage</i>

83
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:14,345
<i>from the intense magnetic pulse
of a nuclear explosion.</i>

84
00:11:14,424 --> 00:11:16,722
<i>- Magnetic pulse?
- Yes, Minister.</i>

85
00:11:16,801 --> 00:11:20,977
<i>One burst in outer space over the UK
and everything with a microchip in it,</i>

86
00:11:21,097 --> 00:11:25,443
<i>from the modern toaster to sophisticated
computers and our defence systems,</i>

00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:27,654
<i>would be rendered useless.</i>

88
00:11:28,104 --> 00:11:30,448
<i>We'd be paralysed - at the Russians' mercy.</i>

89
00:11:30,565 --> 00:11:33,990
<i>That is why a private defence
contractor came up with this:</i>

90
00:11:34,444 --> 00:11:38,824
<i>a chip totally impervious
to magnetic pulse damage.</i>

91
00:11:38,948 --> 00:11:42,418
<i>Now - if I place it on the micro-comparator</i>

92
00:11:42,493 --> 00:11:45,167
<i>and compare it with
the chip Bond recovered</i>

93
00:11:45,288 --> 00:11:49,259
<i>from the body of 003 in Siberia...</i>

94
00:11:51,753 --> 00:11:55,974
<i>- When I bring the two images together...
- They're identical.</i>

95
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:59,560
<i>The KGB must have a pipeline
into that research company.</i>

96
00:11:59,636 --> 00:12:01,263
<i>It would appear so.</i>

97
00:12:01,346 --> 00:12:05,601
<i>Six months ago that company was
acquired by an Anglo-French combine:</i>

00:12:05,683 --> 00:12:07,481
<i>Zorin Industries.</i>

99
00:12:07,977 --> 00:12:10,856
<i>There has been a security
check of the plant?</i>

100
00:12:11,481 --> 00:12:13,984
<i>A very extensive one. But we have no leads.</i>

101
00:12:14,484 --> 00:12:16,282
<i>What about Zorin himself?</i>

102
00:12:16,361 --> 00:12:20,207
<i>Max Zorin? impossible.
He's a leading French industrialist.</i>

103
00:12:20,323 --> 00:12:24,453
<i>A staunch anti-communist with
influential friends in the government.</i>

104
00:12:24,535 --> 00:12:26,663
<i>With due respect, Minister,</i>

105
00:12:26,788 --> 00:12:29,632
<i>the leak did occur
after Zorin bought the company.</i>

106
00:12:29,707 --> 00:12:32,335
<i>Precisely why I've initiated an investigation.</i>

107
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:35,213
<i>All right, but let's be discreet about it.</i>

108
00:12:35,463 --> 00:12:37,636
<i>But of course, Minister.</i>

109
00:12:39,676 --> 00:12:45,308
<i>You have exactly 35 minutes

<i>Perhaps Pegasus does too.</i>

142
00:15:07,657 --> 00:15:10,957

more important to identify the assassin.</i>

<i>He's the outstanding horse of the sales.</i>

Look at the state of my clothes.</i>

I am expected to sacrifice myself.</i>

<i>We'll know after the 22nd.</i>

265
00:31:44,945 --> 00:31:46,697
<i>- Thank you.
- Enjoy yourself.</i>

266
00:31:54,830 --> 00:31:56,332
<i>You were looking for something?</i>

267
00:31:57,207 --> 00:31:59,335
<i>Yes, I... I was looking for the bar.</i>

268
00:32:00,168 --> 00:32:02,671
<i>Come. I will show you.</i>

00:32:08,176 --> 00:32:12,306

<i>Bob Conley.</i>

274
00:32:25,527 --> 00:32:29,373
<i>- Are you a trainer?
- Horses? Hell, I can't even ride.</i>

275
00:32:29,489 --> 00:32:32,413
<i>- I'm in the oil business.
- Oh. Texas? {shutter clicks}</i>

276
00:32:32,492 --> 00:32:35,086
<i>Frisco. I handle Mr Zorin's
oil interests there.</i>

<i>Would you excuse us? Come on, honey.</i>

278
00:32:40,750 --> 00:32:42,627
<i>Are you a doctor of medicine?</i>

279
00:32:42,711 --> 00:32:47,467
<i>Oh, no, no.
I am Mr Zorin's breeding consultant.</i>

280
00:32:48,049 --> 00:32:50,973
<i>Oh, really?
Then you can let me into a little secret.</i>

281
00:32:51,052 --> 00:32:56,559
<i>How is it you succeed with breeding
bloodlines other experts think inferior?</i>

282
00:32:57,100 --> 00:32:59,603
<i>Selective breeding is important.</i>

283
00:32:59,728 --> 00:33:04,234
<i>But more important
is conditioning and a desire, ja?</i>

284
00:33:04,941 --> 00:33:07,694
<i>Are you talking about
people or horses? {shutter clicks}</i>

285
00:33:09,279 --> 00:33:11,657
<i>My principles apply equally
to human beings.</i>

286
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:14,619
<i>Mr St John Smythe.
Allow me to introduce myself.</i>

287
00:33:14,743 --> 00:33:16,416
<i>Mr Zorin, it's a great pleasure.</i>

288
00:33:16,536 --> 00:33:19,415
<i>- A groom asked if you'd go to the stables.
- Of course.</i>

289
00:33:20,499 --> 00:33:21,546
<i>You will excuse me?</i>

290
00:33:24,169 --> 00:33:28,015
<i>I must congratulate you, Mr Zorin.
Your stables are magnificent.</i>

291
00:33:28,089 --> 00:33:32,560
<i>Built in the 16th century by a duke who
believed he'd be reincarnated as a horse.</i>

292
00:33:32,761 --> 00:33:34,684
<i>Have thoroughbreds interested you long?</i>

293
00:33:34,763 --> 00:33:40,190
<i>Oh, no. As a matter of fact I had a dotty
old aunt die and leave me some stables.</i>

294
00:33:40,268 --> 00:33:43,067
<i>So I thought it might be rather fun
to breed and raise horses.</i>

295
00:33:43,897 --> 00:33:48,073
<i>- I take it you ride?
- I'm happiest in the saddle.</i>

296
00:33:48,944 --> 00:33:50,696
<i>A fellow-sportsman.</i>

297
00:33:51,488 --> 00:33:53,240
<i>What about fishing?</i>

298
00:33:54,491 --> 00:33:55,743
<i>Fly casting?</i>

299
00:33:57,911 --> 00:34:02,542
<i>I'm neglecting my other guests. You'll find
the young ladies stimulating company.</i>

300
00:34:03,333 --> 00:34:05,461
<i>I'm sure they are.</i>

301
00:34:17,973 --> 00:34:22,194
<i>Hello. I thought you might
like to join the party.</i>

302
00:34:22,811 --> 00:34:27,658
<i>By the way, the name is
James St John Smythe. I'm English.</i>

303
00:34:28,316 --> 00:34:31,195
<i>Hmm. I never would have guessed.</i>

304
00:34:31,319 --> 00:34:32,571
<i>Really?</i>

305
00:34:32,654 --> 00:34:34,156
<i>Monsieur.</i>

306
00:34:35,865 --> 00:34:38,664
<i>Well, are you buying or selling?</i>

307
00:34:39,619 --> 00:34:42,122
<i>- Selling?
- Horses.</i>

308
00:34:42,956 --> 00:34:43,957
<i>Oh.</i>

309
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:47,010
<i>No, I'm not interested in horses.</i>

310
00:34:47,961 --> 00:34:50,680
<i>Well, you came to the wrong place,
didn't you?</i>

311
00:34:51,715 --> 00:34:53,843
<i>May Day.</i>

312
00:34:55,844 --> 00:34:58,017
<i>Get her away from him.</i>

313
00:34:58,722 --> 00:35:02,317
<i>I'm sure I've seen him somewhere before.</i>

314
00:35:03,310 --> 00:35:05,529
<i>Have Security keep a good eye on him.</i>

315
00:35:06,021 --> 00:35:09,696
<i>You didn't say what part
of the States you come from, Miss...</i>

316
00:35:10,025 --> 00:35:12,153
<i>No. I didn't.</i>

317
00:35:12,694 --> 00:35:14,446
<i>I suppose you...travel a lot?</i>

318
00:35:14,529 --> 00:35:17,248
<i>Your helicopter leaves in 20 minutes.</i>

319
00:35:17,365 --> 00:35:21,711
<i>You're not staying the night? I was hoping
we'd spend the evening together.</i>

320
00:35:22,037 --> 00:35:24,335
<i>Now I shall be all alone.</i>

321
00:35:24,414 --> 00:35:27,213
<i>I doubt that.</i>

322
00:35:27,334 --> 00:35:31,134
<i>- Well, let me walk you to the chopper.
- That won't be necessary.</i>

323
00:35:31,212 --> 00:35:36,059
<i>- Someone will take care of you.
- You'll see to that personally, will you?</i>

324
00:36:49,958 --> 00:36:52,006
<i>- {muffled cry}
- Shhh!</i>

325
00:36:53,795 --> 00:36:55,968
<i>Are you looking for this?</i>

326
00:36:57,006 --> 00:36:59,134
<i>Quite a letdown.</i>

327
00:37:41,384 --> 00:37:44,558
<i>- St John Smythe?
- Sleeping like a baby.</i>

328
00:37:44,679 --> 00:37:47,558
<i>{snoring}</i>

329
00:38:10,205 --> 00:38:11,377
<i>That's a boy.</i>

330
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:14,588
<i>There we are.</i>

331
00:38:27,764 --> 00:38:30,358
<i>It's interesting. He's had surgery.</i>

332
00:38:32,519 --> 00:38:36,740
<i>Surgery? That is how Zorin won the race.</i>

333
00:38:37,232 --> 00:38:40,702
<i>Mortner implanted one of
these microchips into Pegasus.</i>

334
00:38:41,027 --> 00:38:45,624
<i>You see, these microchips are
programmed to control an injection</i>

335
00:38:45,698 --> 00:38:48,292
<i>of additional natural horse steroids.</i>

336
00:38:48,576 --> 00:38:51,750
<i>- To overcome fatigue during the race.
- How?</i>

337
00:38:52,205 --> 00:38:55,505
<i>The injection itself, with that small needle,</i>

338
00:38:55,583 --> 00:38:59,008
<i>is triggered by a remote-control transmitter</i>

339
00:38:59,087 --> 00:39:02,557
<i>small enough to fit into
the tip of a jockey's whip</i>

340
00:39:03,299 --> 00:39:04,391
<i>OF 8 cane.</i>

341
00:39:05,927 --> 00:39:07,429
<i>The lights!</i>

342
00:39:42,755 --> 00:39:45,759
<i>There's a world surplus of microchips
and Zorin is hoarding them!</i>

343
00:39:45,967 --> 00:39:48,140
<i>{whir of machinery}</i>

344
00:39:48,344 --> 00:39:52,520
<i>- Dis donc, on va voir ce qui se passe?
- D'accord.</i>

345
00:40:30,595 --> 00:40:32,472
<i>{whirring}</i>

346
00:40:36,476 --> 00:40:40,026
<i>- I'm afraid I wasn't much help.
- Don't worry. It's all wrapped up.</i>

347
00:41:01,167 --> 00:41:04,296
<i>Keep your guard up higher.
And retain your balance.</i>

348
00:41:17,100 --> 00:41:19,194
<i>{muffled shouts}</i>

349
00:41:22,397 --> 00:41:24,946
<i>- Aiiii!
- Oof!</i>

350
00:41:54,095 --> 00:41:56,564
<i>- What now?
- We'd better get back.</i>

351
00:41:56,639 --> 00:41:58,937
<i>The tape ran out five minutes ago.</i>

352
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:01,728
<i>{phone rings}</i>

353
00:42:11,487 --> 00:42:13,364
<i>I told you not to disturb us.</i>

354
00:42:13,448 --> 00:42:17,078
<i>{Scarpine} It's important.
There's been intruders in the warehouse.</i>

355
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:19,458
<i>Put Security on full alert.</i>

356
00:42:21,164 --> 00:42:23,758
<i>Let's see where Mr St John Smythe is.</i>

357
00:43:00,495 --> 00:43:03,465
<i>He was the man at the Eiffel Tower.</i>

358
00:43:03,998 --> 00:43:07,172
<i>- We must find him.
- I'll get dressed.</i>

359
00:43:16,010 --> 00:43:20,811
<i>{Bond} May Day, where have you been?
I've been waiting for you.</i>

360
00:43:20,973 --> 00:43:22,896
<i>To take care of me personally.</i>

361
00:43:38,199 --> 00:43:41,544
<i>I see you're a woman of very few words.</i>

362
00:43:44,497 --> 00:43:46,545
<i>What's there to say?</i>

363
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:09,488
<i>- Is everything here?
- Ja, ja.</i>

364
00:44:10,606 --> 00:44:12,734
<i>Except this.</i>

365
00:44:13,526 --> 00:44:14,994
<i>It is in the wrong place.</i>

366
00:44:15,945 --> 00:44:21,042
<i>Bring St John Smythe to my study
first thing in the morning.</i>

367
00:44:29,750 --> 00:44:32,549
<i>- {Bond} Good morning.
- Good morning.</i>

368
00:44:32,628 --> 00:44:35,677
<i>I understand you wish to see me.</i>

369
00:44:35,756 --> 00:44:40,557
<i>- You slept well?
- A little restless, but I got off eventually.</i>

370
00:44:41,429 --> 00:44:44,228
<i>I have the Progeny Index on the computer:</i>

371
00:44:44,307 --> 00:44:46,810
<i>a compilation of
thoroughbred bloodlines.</i>

372
00:44:46,934 --> 00:44:49,153
<i>Might be helpful to you in selecting
your purchase this afternoon.</i>

373
00:44:52,607 --> 00:44:55,986
<i>As I see it, you need a stallion. For breeding.</i>

374
00:44:56,110 --> 00:44:58,238
<i>A stallion sounds right to me.</i>

375
00:44:59,447 --> 00:45:01,825
<i>I find a computer indispensable.</i>

376
00:45:08,122 --> 00:45:12,343
<i>I have a stallion.
Descended from that horse there.</i>

377
00:45:13,544 --> 00:45:14,761
<i>Misty.</i>

378
00:45:25,765 --> 00:45:28,143
<i>We have several horses
that might interest you.</i>

379
00:45:36,484 --> 00:45:40,455
<i>Would you be interested
primarily in stamina?</i>

380
00:45:40,529 --> 00:45:44,659
<i>- Or speed?
- Well, a little of both would be ideal.</i>

381
00:45:48,746 --> 00:45:50,498
<i>I think I have just the horse for you.</i>

382
00:45:50,998 --> 00:45:52,671
<i>{clock chimes}</i>

383
00:45:53,501 --> 00:45:55,924
<i>It's time for my morning ride.</i>

384
00:45:56,212 --> 00:45:59,682
<i>- Why don't you try him out?
- That sounds a very good idea.</i>

385
00:46:00,466 --> 00:46:03,140
<i>- I shall get into some riding clothes.
- Good.</i>

386
00:46:03,219 --> 00:46:05,972
<i>Half an hour, then. Scarpine will collect you.</i>

387
00:46:06,055 --> 00:46:08,183
<i>Thank you.</i>

388
00:46:11,394 --> 00:46:13,522
<i>{hums}</i>

389
00:46:16,482 --> 00:46:20,282
<i>Tibbett, get into town, call M
and ask him to put a trace on this cheque.</i>

390
00:46:20,361 --> 00:46:24,537
<i>Be quick. If those guards we laid out
identify us we'll have to move fast.</i>

391
00:46:24,824 --> 00:46:26,576
<i>What shall I say if they ask where I'm going?</i>

392
00:46:27,618 --> 00:46:29,211
<i>Just tell them
you have to get the car washed.</i>

393
00:46:54,562 --> 00:46:56,189
<i>Just going to town to get the car washed.</i>

394
00:47:21,630 --> 00:47:26,101
<i>- Your mount, Mr St John Smythe.
- A beautiful beast.</i>

395
00:47:27,970 --> 00:47:30,849
<i>A little spirited. What's his name?</i>

396
00:47:31,557 --> 00:47:32,649
<i>Inferno.</i>

397
00:47:39,273 --> 00:47:41,321
<i>{neighs}</i>

398
00:48:07,426 --> 00:48:09,474
<i>Merci.</i>

399
00:49:01,689 --> 00:49:04,613
<i>- Friends of yours?
- Exercise boys.</i>

400
00:49:04,692 --> 00:49:06,490
<i>Jumping together is more realistic training.</i>

401
00:49:08,446 --> 00:49:11,825
<i>Frankly, I prefer cross-country
to steeplechase.</i>

402
00:49:12,116 --> 00:49:15,791
<i>As one sportsman to another,
I'll make you a proposition.</i>

403
00:49:15,870 --> 00:49:18,749
<i>You can have that lthacus colt gratis
if you stay this course.</i>

404
00:49:21,542 --> 00:49:24,216
<i>- And if I'm thrown?
- Then you lose.</i>

405
00:49:26,547 --> 00:49:28,220
<i>You leave me little choice.</i>

406
00:49:30,217 --> 00:49:33,096
<i>Splendid. Scarpine will start us.</i>

407
00:49:35,097 --> 00:49:37,225
<i>{neighs}</i>

408
00:50:47,461 --> 00:50:48,963
<i>Steady!</i>

409
00:51:15,406 --> 00:51:18,501
<i>Keep going! Keep going!</i>

410
00:51:19,034 --> 00:51:20,081
<i>Sir Godfrey. Let's get...</i>

411
00:51:39,555 --> 00:51:40,932
<i>You lost, 007.</i>

412
00:51:42,558 --> 00:51:46,028
<i>- Killing Tibbett was a mistake.
- I'm about to make the same one twice.</i>

413
00:51:47,104 --> 00:51:49,983
<i>My department know I'm here.
They'll retaliate.</i>

414
00:51:50,357 --> 00:51:52,485
<i>If you're the best they have,</i>

415
00:51:52,568 --> 00:51:55,412
<i>they'll more likely try
to cover up your incompetence.</i>

416
00:51:56,030 --> 00:51:57,327
<i>Don't count on it, Zorin.</i>

417
00:51:58,282 --> 00:52:02,082
<i>- You amuse me, Mr Bond.
- Well, it's not mutual.</i>

418
00:52:02,995 --> 00:52:05,043
<i>Other side.</i>

419
00:52:09,376 --> 00:52:11,424
<i>Open up-</i>

420
00:54:29,892 --> 00:54:33,066
<i>- Good morning, Comrade Zorin.
- General Gogol.</i>

421
00:54:33,479 --> 00:54:36,983
<i>- This meeting is ill-advised.
- A calculated risk.</i>

422
00:54:37,065 --> 00:54:39,818
<i>But necessary,
as you refuse to answer your control.</i>

423
00:54:40,068 --> 00:54:41,445
<i>Come to the point, General.</i>

424
00:54:42,196 --> 00:54:44,290
<i>You disregard procedure.</i>

425
00:54:44,364 --> 00:54:47,868
<i>You did not request approval
before eliminating 007.</i>

426
00:54:49,077 --> 00:54:53,002
<i>- Reprisals mightjeopardise operations.
- You jeopardise mine!</i>

427
00:54:56,001 --> 00:54:58,800
<i>Letting the British penetrate
the Siberian research centre.</i>

428
00:54:58,879 --> 00:55:00,381
<i>That was regrettable.</i>

429
00:55:00,547 --> 00:55:04,597
<i>Your racing activities
attract unnecessary attention,</i>

430
00:55:04,676 --> 00:55:09,352
<i>but more disturbing are your
unauthorised commercial ventures.</i>

431
00:55:09,431 --> 00:55:10,933
<i>We cannot tolerate that.</i>

432
00:55:11,600 --> 00:55:15,104
<i>The issue is irrelevant.
I've made new associations.</i>

433
00:55:15,229 --> 00:55:17,527
<i>I no longer consider myself a KGB agent.</i>

434
00:55:17,648 --> 00:55:20,652
<i>We trained you. Financed you. Huh!</i>

435
00:55:21,693 --> 00:55:27,621
<i>What would you be without us?
A biological experiment. A freak.</i>

436
00:55:34,790 --> 00:55:37,088
<i>Enough of this! Control yourselves!</i>

437
00:55:43,632 --> 00:55:49,264
<i>You will come back to us, Comrade.
No one ever leaves the KGB.</i>

438
00:55:52,766 --> 00:55:53,767
<i>Gentlemen.</i>

439
00:55:53,892 --> 00:55:58,989
<i>For centuries alchemists
tried to make gold from base metals.</i>

440
00:55:59,773 --> 00:56:04,404
<i>Today we make microchips
from silicon, which is common sand.</i>

441
00:56:05,612 --> 00:56:08,115
<i>- But far better than gold, hm?
- {laughter}</i>

442
00:56:08,866 --> 00:56:11,870
<i>For several years we've had
a profitable partnership:</i>

443
00:56:11,952 --> 00:56:17,709
<i>you as manufacturers, while I passed on
to you industrial information</i>

444
00:56:17,791 --> 00:56:21,591
<i>that made you competitive, successful.</i>

445
00:56:24,006 --> 00:56:29,888
<i>We are now in the unique position
to form an international cartel</i>

446
00:56:30,304 --> 00:56:36,277
<i>to control not only production
but distribution of these microchips.</i>

447
00:56:38,020 --> 00:56:40,114
<i>There is one obstacle.</i>

448
00:56:52,326 --> 00:56:53,669
<i>Silicon Valley.</i>

449
00:56:54,578 --> 00:56:56,751
<i>Near San Francisco.</i>

450
00:56:56,830 --> 00:57:02,052
<i>Over 250 plants employing
thousands of scientists, technicians.</i>

451
00:57:02,127 --> 00:57:05,722
<i>This is the heartland of electronic
production in the United States,</i>

452
00:57:05,839 --> 00:57:10,345
<i>which accounts for what-
80% of the world microchip market.</i>

453
00:57:10,886 --> 00:57:13,014
<i>I propose to end</i>

454
00:57:14,848 --> 00:57:17,351
<i>the domination of Silicon Valley</i>

455
00:57:19,394 --> 00:57:22,944
<i>- and leave us in control of that market.
- What is it you propose?</i>

456
00:57:23,815 --> 00:57:26,318
<i>Project Main Strike.</i>

457
00:57:27,235 --> 00:57:30,739
<i>For which, each of you will pay me
one hundred million dollars.</i>

458
00:57:31,323 --> 00:57:33,371
<i>A hundred million dollars?</i>

459
00:57:34,201 --> 00:57:37,956
<i>Plus half our net income?</i>

460
00:57:38,246 --> 00:57:41,295
<i>Under an exclusive
marketing agreement with me.</i>

461
00:57:41,375 --> 00:57:42,718
<i>These are outrageous terms!</i>

462
00:57:43,418 --> 00:57:46,297
<i>Perhaps a demonstration
would convince you.</i>

463
00:57:46,838 --> 00:57:51,218
<i>- I want no part of it, thank you.
- As you wish. Hmph!</i>

464
00:57:52,469 --> 00:57:55,723
<i>The rest of our discussion
must of course be confidential.</i>

465
00:57:55,806 --> 00:57:59,856
<i>- Would you wait outside?
- If you'd like me to, yes. Excuse me.</i>

466
00:58:00,560 --> 00:58:03,234
<i>May Day will provide you with a drink.</i>

467
00:58:09,027 --> 00:58:11,075
<i>This way.</i>

468
00:58:33,468 --> 00:58:34,811
<i>Aaagghhh!</i>

469
00:58:37,806 --> 00:58:40,025
<i>So, does anybody else want to drop out?</i>

470
00:58:42,936 --> 00:58:45,064
<i>{voices on intercom}</i>

471
00:58:50,819 --> 00:58:52,071
<i>Wow!</i>

472
00:58:54,448 --> 00:58:56,075
<i>What a view!</i>

473
00:58:56,324 --> 00:58:57,871
<i>To a kill.</i>

474
00:59:29,983 --> 00:59:31,826
<i>Five dollars.</i>

475
00:59:31,985 --> 00:59:34,033
<i>Thank you.</i>

476
00:59:37,240 --> 00:59:41,586
<i>- Looking for something special?
- Yes. Soft-shell crabs.</i>

477
00:59:42,662 --> 00:59:44,710
<i>Might have some in the back.</i>

478
00:59:45,832 --> 00:59:47,880
<i>I'll be a few minutes.</i>

479
00:59:55,675 --> 00:59:59,600
<i>Chuck Lee, CIA.
It's a pleasure working with 007.</i>

480
00:59:59,679 --> 01:00:03,604
<i>- Thanks. Now what about Zorin?
- He's in town. I can have him tailed.</i>

481
01:00:03,683 --> 01:00:05,060
<i>No, not yet.</i>

482
01:00:06,186 --> 01:00:10,942
<i>Conley is a geologist. Runs Zorin's
oil reclamation project in the East Bay.</i>

483
01:00:11,191 --> 01:00:14,411
<i>Last job: chief engineer
in a South African gold mine.</i>

484
01:00:14,528 --> 01:00:17,372
<i>Left in a hurry
after a cave-in killed 20 miners.</i>

485
01:00:17,447 --> 01:00:20,792
<i>Zorin's kind of man!
What about the girl? And the cheque?</i>

486
01:00:20,867 --> 01:00:22,744
<i>You know how many S Suttons
there are in the US?</i>

487
01:00:23,411 --> 01:00:26,415
<i>We watch Zorin's account.
The cheque hasn't been cashed.</i>

488
01:00:26,706 --> 01:00:29,459
<i>- Mortner?
- Got a real winner here.</i>

489
01:00:29,876 --> 01:00:34,552
<i>His real name is Hans Glaub, a German
pioneer in the development of steroids.</i>

490
01:00:35,048 --> 01:00:38,018
<i>That ties in with the horse injections.</i>

491
01:00:38,218 --> 01:00:43,099
<i>In the war he used steroids on pregnant
women in the concentration camps</i>

- Virtually every mother aborted.</i>

494
01:00:49,187 --> 01:00:52,191
<i>A handful of children
were produced with phenomenal lQs.</i>

495
01:00:52,524 --> 01:00:55,403
<i>But there was a side-effect:
they were psychotics.</i>

496
01:00:55,485 --> 01:00:58,739
<i>Why wasn't this Mortner or Glaub
tried by the War Crimes Commission?</i>

497
01:00:59,322 --> 01:01:01,871
<i>The Russians grabbed him.
Set him up in a laboratory.</i>

498
01:01:01,950 --> 01:01:06,956
<i>He spent years developing steroids for
their athletes, then vanished 15 years ago.</i>

499

<i>About the same time
Zorin came over to the West.</i>

500
01:01:10,250 --> 01:01:11,923
<i>Could Zorin be one of the steroid kids?</i>

501
01:01:14,504 --> 01:01:18,600
<i>He's definitely the right age,
and he's certainly psychotic.</i>

502
01:01:18,758 --> 01:01:20,101
<i>What about his oil operations?</i>

503
01:01:21,761 --> 01:01:23,434

<i>- Can you spare a minute?
- Sure thing.</i>

506
01:01:28,894 --> 01:01:33,570
<i>The oil operation looks clean, except
for a problem with the crab fishermen.</i>

507
01:01:34,357 --> 01:01:37,486
<i>Good morning.
Here's that reporter I told you about.</i>

508
01:01:37,569 --> 01:01:40,288
<i>Mr O'Rourke.
I understand you have a problem.</i>

509
01:01:40,363 --> 01:01:44,743
<i>That Zorin oil pumping station ruined
one of the best crab patches in the Bay.</i>

510

<i>Scared them away?</i>

511
01:01:46,161 --> 01:01:49,005
<i>They didn't go nowhere.
They just disappeared.</i>

512
01:01:50,874 --> 01:01:53,343
<i>Well, I'd like to look at
that oil pumping station.</i>

513
01:01:54,044 --> 01:01:56,467
<i>That'll be tough. It's very heavily guarded.</i>

514
01:02:19,444 --> 01:02:22,994
<i>We'll be testing new equipment shortly.
Keep a sharp lookout.</i>

515

<i>- I don't want anyone near this dock.
- Very good, sir.</i>

516
01:02:27,035 --> 01:02:30,335
<i>- Valves 5 to 15 are open.

517
01:02:30,705 --> 01:02:34,255
<i>{female technician}
Valves open and ready to receive water.</i>

518
01:02:34,334 --> 01:02:37,383

<i>Yes, sir.</i>

531
01:03:34,686 --> 01:03:36,609

01:18:40,507 --> 01:18:42,726
<i>So I took this job as state geologist</i>

659
01:18:42,801 --> 01:18:46,522
<i>and I've just managed
to hold on to the house and my shares.</i>

660
01:18:47,556 --> 01:18:50,730
<i>And that's what the $5 million were for?
Your shares?</i>

661
01:18:51,143 --> 01:18:54,898
<i>Ten times more than they're worth. Just...</i>

662
01:18:56,982 --> 01:19:00,031
<i>Just drop the lawsuit and shut my mouth.</i>

663
01:19:00,486 --> 01:19:01,658
<i>I haven't accepted yet.</i>

664
01:19:02,571 --> 01:19:06,496
<i>So Zorin sent along his gorillas
to help you make up your mind.</i>

665
01:19:08,035 --> 01:19:10,413
<i>They have. {rips up cheque}</i>

666
01:19:15,376 --> 01:19:18,471
<i>I'd sell everything and live in a tent
before I give up.</i>

667
01:19:41,944 --> 01:19:44,038
<i>That was delicious.</i>

668
01:19:45,364 --> 01:19:48,288
<i>And the way you handled those men.</i>

669
01:19:49,326 --> 01:19:51,420
<i>Well, those...</i>

670
01:19:52,246 --> 01:19:54,669
<i>baboons could come back.</i>

671
01:19:54,915 --> 01:19:57,009
<i>I hope not.</i>

672
01:19:59,461 --> 01:20:01,555
<i>Well, then, I'll...</i>

673
01:20:02,423 --> 01:20:06,553
<i>check the windows and doors, and...</i>

674
01:20:06,760 --> 01:20:11,266
<i>- Oh! Reconnect the telephone.
- The box is outside my bedroom window.</i>

675
01:20:12,391 --> 01:20:15,065
<i>I think I should be able to find that.</i>

676
01:21:15,996 --> 01:21:18,090
<i>{rumbling}</i>

677
01:21:22,461 --> 01:21:24,429
<i>- Good morning.
- Good morning.</i>

678
01:21:24,505 --> 01:21:28,135
<i>Oh, I say! Breakfast out of bed.</i>

679
01:21:28,467 --> 01:21:30,890
<i>- What's wrong with them?
- We had an earth tremor.</i>

680
01:21:30,969 --> 01:21:34,143
<i>They're extremely sensitive
to seismic activity.</i>

681
01:21:34,223 --> 01:21:37,318
<i>Let's see what
the Earthquake Center has on it.</i>

682
01:21:39,103 --> 01:21:43,654
<i>Just a minor tremor. Measured 2.5
on the Richter scale. Location...</i>

683
01:21:44,983 --> 01:21:47,611
<i>That's odd.
The epicentre's near Zorin's oil field.</i>

684
01:21:49,530 --> 01:21:54,286
<i>I told Howe yesterday that Zorin
was pumping sea water into his wells.</i>

685
01:21:54,368 --> 01:21:57,087
<i>- Is there a connection?
- Sea water?</i>

686
01:21:57,287 --> 01:21:59,881
<i>Those wells are in the Hayward fault.</i>

687
01:22:00,040 --> 01:22:02,259
<i>- Are you sure?
- I checked it myself.</i>

688
01:22:02,960 --> 01:22:05,088
<i>That's incredibly dangerous.</i>

689
01:22:07,089 --> 01:22:09,387
<i>Howe has to stop Zorin now.</i>

690
01:22:10,717 --> 01:22:12,845
<i>{raised voices}</i>

691
01:22:23,981 --> 01:22:25,904
<i>- What happened?
- I got fired.</i>

692
01:22:25,983 --> 01:22:29,362
<i>- He fire... He fired me.
- All right. Calm down.</i>

693
01:22:29,445 --> 01:22:32,540
<i>This evening we'll meet
a friend of mine from Washington.</i>

694
01:22:32,614 --> 01:22:36,869
<i>Maybe, just maybe,
he'll come up with a few answers.</i>

695
01:22:44,585 --> 01:22:48,055
<i>I wish we could be more specific about
Zorin's intentions before I go to the top.</i>

696
01:22:48,839 --> 01:22:51,718
<i>Flooding a fault
could cause a major earthquake.</i>

697
01:22:52,092 --> 01:22:54,094
<i>But what would Zorin have to gain?</i>

698
01:22:55,387 --> 01:22:59,893
<i>On the tape Zorin mentioned Silicon Valley.
Could that be affected?</i>

699
01:23:00,267 --> 01:23:03,316
<i>No, not severely.
Silicon Valley's too far away.</i>

700
01:23:03,395 --> 01:23:07,775
<i>But if we knew how many wells were
involved...we might get a clearer picture.</i>

701
01:23:08,108 --> 01:23:11,703
<i>That information's available at City Hall.</i>

702
01:23:11,778 --> 01:23:15,078
<i>- I still have my security pass.
- Then let's go to City Hall.</i>

703
01:23:15,157 --> 01:23:18,752
<i>- Let me go and get it.
- I'll tell Washington we need more help.</i>

704
01:23:18,827 --> 01:23:21,831
<i>Don't waste any time. There's only 24 hours.</i>

705
01:23:43,060 --> 01:23:45,859
<i>{car radio comes on with engine}</i>

706
01:23:57,282 --> 01:23:59,376
<i>{faint music from car}</i>

707
01:24:15,300 --> 01:24:17,928
<i>- Good evening, Jeff.
- Evening, ma'am.</i>

708
01:24:21,515 --> 01:24:23,358
<i>- Won't be long.
- OK.</i>

709
01:25:20,907 --> 01:25:24,036
<i>- Main Strike.
- Hey, I know that place.</i>

710
01:25:24,494 --> 01:25:29,546
<i>That's an abandoned silver mine
by the San Andreas fault.</i>

711
01:25:29,625 --> 01:25:31,502
<i>{gasps}</i>

712
01:25:31,585 --> 01:25:36,261
<i>Alive and well, I see.
And still bungling in the dark.</i>

713
01:25:37,049 --> 01:25:39,347
<i>Well, then,
why don't you enlighten me, Zorin?</i>

714
01:25:40,469 --> 01:25:42,722
<i>You're out of your depth.</i>

715
01:25:42,804 --> 01:25:48,777
<i>And you, Sutton. You should have
accepted my more than generous offer.</i>

716
01:25:49,144 --> 01:25:52,489
<i>- You can take your offer and shove it.
- Don't bother, Stacey.</i>

717
01:25:52,606 --> 01:25:54,108
<i>He's a psychopath.</i>

718
01:25:55,192 --> 01:25:57,570
<i>You two have joined forces?</i>

719
01:25:58,987 --> 01:26:03,242
<i>- That simplifies things.
- He's probably armed.</i>

720
01:26:13,752 --> 01:26:14,799
<i>Stacey, I...</i>

721
01:26:15,587 --> 01:26:17,214
<i>Mr Zorin.</i>

722
01:26:17,381 --> 01:26:19,383
<i>Call the police, Mr Howe.</i>

723
01:26:21,134 --> 01:26:24,638
<i>- What's going on?
- Tell them...there's been a break-in.</i>

724
01:26:25,639 --> 01:26:27,858
<i>Ask them to get here as soon as possible.</i>

725
01:26:28,850 --> 01:26:30,272
<i>You're being used, Mr Howe.</i>

726
01:26:31,770 --> 01:26:33,147
<i>Do it.</i>

727
01:26:36,108 --> 01:26:38,202
<i>- Police
- Hello.</i>

728
01:26:38,860 --> 01:26:40,612
<i>We've had a break-in here.</i>

729
01:26:41,154 --> 01:26:44,624
<i>- City Hall, office 306. Come at once.
- Right away.</i>

730
01:26:46,493 --> 01:26:49,292
<i>- What have they done?
- You discharged her.</i>

731
01:26:50,497 --> 01:26:53,626
<i>So she and her accomplice
came here to kill you.</i>

732
01:26:54,126 --> 01:26:58,006
<i>Then they set fire to the office
to conceal the crime,</i>

733
01:26:58,505 --> 01:27:01,258
<i>but they were trapped in the elevator.</i>

734
01:27:02,884 --> 01:27:05,353
<i>And perished in the flames.</i>

735
01:27:07,889 --> 01:27:11,189
<i>But that means I would have to be...</i>

736
01:27:11,643 --> 01:27:12,769
<i>Dead.</i>

737
01:27:17,983 --> 01:27:20,236
<i>That's rather neat. Don't you think?</i>

738
01:27:21,486 --> 01:27:24,456
<i>Brilliant.
I'm almost speechless with admiration.</i>

739
01:27:25,115 --> 01:27:29,791
<i>Intuitive improvisation
is the secret of genius.</i>

740
01:27:30,287 --> 01:27:33,507
<i>Herr Doktor Mortner
will be proud of his creation.</i>

741
01:27:49,473 --> 01:27:50,941
<i>Please.</i>

742
01:27:55,937 --> 01:27:57,189
<i>Get back.</i>

743
01:28:26,134 --> 01:28:28,228
<i>{Stacey cries out}</i>

744
01:28:32,891 --> 01:28:34,814
<i>- Out.
- Let's go.</i>

745
01:28:35,769 --> 01:28:37,316
<i>Get back!</i>

746
01:28:50,325 --> 01:28:52,077
<i>{fire alarm sounds}</i>

747
01:29:05,966 --> 01:29:08,060
<i>{cables creak}</i>

748
01:29:15,767 --> 01:29:17,861
<i>{creaking}</i>

749
01:29:21,189 --> 01:29:22,566
<i>Hold tight.</i>

750
01:29:33,827 --> 01:29:35,249
<i>Come on, Stacey.</i>

751
01:29:35,871 --> 01:29:37,965
<i>Give me your hand. Stretch!</i>

752
01:29:39,499 --> 01:29:40,591
<i>Stretch I</i>

753
01:29:46,298 --> 01:29:47,800
<i>Don't go away</i>

754
01:29:56,808 --> 01:29:59,027
<i>James, don't leave me!</i>

755
01:30:02,564 --> 01:30:04,658
<i>James! {coughs}</i>

756
01:30:05,525 --> 01:30:06,777
<i>Help me!</i>

757
01:30:08,904 --> 01:30:11,623
<i>James! {coughs}</i>

758
01:30:12,699 --> 01:30:15,452
<i>Help me! Help me!</i>

759
01:30:21,708 --> 01:30:23,176
<i>James!</i>

760
01:30:27,964 --> 01:30:29,511
<i>I'll be right with you.</i>

761
01:30:35,764 --> 01:30:37,858
<i>Help! Help!</i>

762
01:30:38,058 --> 01:30:42,313
<i>- {woman} It is the City Hall.
- {man} I'll call the fire department.</i>

763
01:30:44,356 --> 01:30:46,029
<i>{sirens and horns}</i>

764
01:30:48,193 --> 01:30:50,946
<i>Try and come this side of the girder.</i>

765
01:30:51,029 --> 01:30:53,327
<i>- Catch this.
- I can't reach it!</i>

766
01:30:53,448 --> 01:30:54,495
<i>Come on. Catch!</i>

767
01:30:55,951 --> 01:30:58,704
<i>- Now...push!
- {screams}</i>

768
01:31:12,717 --> 01:31:14,845
<i>{horn}</i>

769
01:31:18,515 --> 01:31:22,190
<i>- {Stacey pants}
- Go on.</i>

770
01:31:25,063 --> 01:31:27,566
<i>Good girl. You're nearly there.</i>

771
01:31:29,567 --> 01:31:31,069
<i>Go on, stretch!</i>

772
01:31:31,653 --> 01:31:33,747
<i>{Stacey coughs}</i>

773
01:31:36,658 --> 01:31:38,331
<i>{screams}</i>

774
01:31:40,412 --> 01:31:42,506
<i>{sirens}</i>

775
01:31:48,586 --> 01:31:51,510
<i>Get this TV crew outta here, will ya?</i>

776
01:31:51,840 --> 01:31:54,013
<i>Come on. Get outta my way.</i>

777
01:31:55,760 --> 01:31:57,808
<i>{coughs}</i>

778
01:32:02,767 --> 01:32:08,615
<i>{woman} All we know is that there are
people trapped inside of City Hall.</i>

<i>{officer} Come on. Back off, will ya?</i>

780
01:32:56,821 --> 01:32:58,949
<i>Let us through, goddammit.</i>

781
01:33:16,049 --> 01:33:20,429
<i>Give her some air.
Comin' through. Out of the way, please.</i>

782
01:33:22,764 --> 01:33:24,983
<i>Stacey. Stacey, you're safe.</i>

783
01:33:25,767 --> 01:33:29,488
<i>Let me through.
Let me through, goddammit.</i>

784
01:33:30,355 --> 01:33:31,902
<i>I wanna talk to you.</i>

785
01:33:31,981 --> 01:33:35,360
<i>Captain. If you can get to
Howe's office you'll find him dead.</i>

786
01:33:35,443 --> 01:33:37,696
<i>We found him - and this gun. This yours?</i>

787
01:33:37,779 --> 01:33:40,157
<i>- Yes, thanks.
- Turn around.</i>

788
01:33:40,240 --> 01:33:43,961
<i>If you check with Chuck Lee of the CIA,
he'll inform you who I am.</i>

789
01:33:44,035 --> 01:33:46,788
<i>- We found his body in Chinatown.
- What?</i>

790
01:33:47,205 --> 01:33:48,923
<i>- You're under arrest.
- Wait.</i>

791
01:33:49,165 --> 01:33:52,635
<i>This is James Stock
of the London Financial Times.</i>

792
01:33:52,710 --> 01:33:55,304
<i>Actually I'm with the British Secret Service.</i>

793
01:33:55,380 --> 01:33:57,599
<i>The name is Bond. James Bond.</i>

794
01:33:57,966 --> 01:34:00,014
<i>- Is he?
- Are you?</i>

795
01:34:00,093 --> 01:34:01,185
<i>Yes.</i>

796
01:34:01,469 --> 01:34:03,346
<i>And I'm Dick Tracy
and you're still under arrest.</i>

797
01:34:07,934 --> 01:34:09,356
<i>Get in here.</i>

798
01:34:18,862 --> 01:34:22,583
<i>Hey, where's that guy goin'?
That ladder's unlocked.</i>

799
01:34:25,368 --> 01:34:28,463
<i>Is that true what you said
about the British secret service?</i>

800
01:34:28,538 --> 01:34:29,755
<i>Yes, I'm afraid it is.</i>

801
01:34:32,500 --> 01:34:36,425
<i>My real name is Bond. James Bond.
You must take my word for it.</i>

<i>{siren comes on}</i>

803
01:34:58,610 --> 01:35:00,032
<i>Put your hand on this.</i>

804
01:35:00,111 --> 01:35:03,581
<i>The wheel! Take over. Put your foot on here.</i>

805
01:35:07,076 --> 01:35:09,454
<i>James, where are you going?</i>

806
01:35:11,206 --> 01:35:15,586
<i>{police chief} To all units. Intercept
murder suspect in stolen fire truck.</i>

807
01:35:16,169 --> 01:35:18,672
<i>He may be armed and he's sure dangerous.</i>

808
01:35:20,882 --> 01:35:24,682
<i>- Pull away you idiots.
- I can't. The fenders are locked!</i>

809
01:35:41,319 --> 01:35:45,449
<i>- I told you, they're locked!
- Oh, my God, watch out!</i>

810
01:35:52,288 --> 01:35:54,382
<i>Ohhh!</i>

811
01:35:59,712 --> 01:36:01,806
<i>{horn}</i>

812
01:36:03,967 --> 01:36:06,015
<i>- Jeez!
- Turn!</i>

813
01:36:11,057 --> 01:36:12,809
<i>Not this way. That way!</i>

814
01:36:12,976 --> 01:36:14,023
<i>Shit!</i>

815
01:36:21,401 --> 01:36:23,324
<i>Ohhhh!</i>

816
01:36:26,698 --> 01:36:28,996
<i>- Swing me back!
- Oh, jeez!</i>

817
01:36:48,219 --> 01:36:50,313
<i>Drive on!</i>

818
01:37:03,526 --> 01:37:06,325
<i>- I think I can get him.
- Go for it!</i>

819
01:37:20,293 --> 01:37:22,387
<i>{Yells}</i>

820
01:37:23,755 --> 01:37:25,678
<i>That should keep them on the wrong track.</i>

821
01:37:29,302 --> 01:37:31,225
<i>{phone rings}</i>

822
01:37:31,304 --> 01:37:32,601
<i>Hello.</i>

823
01:37:33,514 --> 01:37:36,267
<i>Raise the bridge? Right now?</i>

824
01:37:37,977 --> 01:37:39,069
<i>Yes, sir!</i>

825
01:37:39,896 --> 01:37:42,820
<i>I got him. Oh, jeez, I got him!</i>

826
01:37:49,906 --> 01:37:51,203
<i>{horn}</i>

827
01:37:53,242 --> 01:37:55,119
<i>Keep going, keep going!</i>

828
01:38:00,291 --> 01:38:01,383
<i>{alarm sounds}</i>

829
01:38:16,849 --> 01:38:17,975
<i>{officer} Oh, my God!</i>

830
01:38:26,234 --> 01:38:29,158
<i>Hey, watch out! Get out of the way!</i>

831
01:38:33,116 --> 01:38:34,288
<i>Jesus!</i>

832
01:38:37,078 --> 01:38:39,172
<i>Oh, mother! I... I...</i>

833
01:38:44,585 --> 01:38:45,677
<i>Holy shit!</i>

834
01:38:47,130 --> 01:38:48,347
<i>Move it!</i>

835
01:38:57,598 --> 01:38:59,271
<i>Harris...</i>

836
01:38:59,350 --> 01:39:01,569
<i>Forget about that sergeant promotion.</i>

837
01:39:01,644 --> 01:39:05,945
<i>You'll have to pay for this vehicle.
100 bucks a month out of your paycheck.</i>

838
01:39:06,023 --> 01:39:07,866
<i>{metal buckling}</i>

839
01:39:14,866 --> 01:39:16,618
<i>Oh, no!</i>

840
01:39:23,541 --> 01:39:25,088
<i>Wake up. We're there.</i>

841
01:39:27,003 --> 01:39:29,381
<i>There's a lot of activity
for an abandoned mine.</i>

842
01:39:29,922 --> 01:39:33,517
<i>That truckload of explosives
should last them for months.</i>

843
01:39:34,135 --> 01:39:35,682
<i>Here comes next year's supply.</i>

844
01:39:36,762 --> 01:39:38,059
<i>Get down.</i>

845
01:39:39,807 --> 01:39:41,901
<i>{siren on}</i>

846
01:39:48,065 --> 01:39:50,363
<i>- Where's the fire?
- On your rear end.</i>

847
01:40:01,537 --> 01:40:03,084
<i>Give me a hand.</i>

848
01:40:09,795 --> 01:40:11,513
<i>Hey!</i>

849
01:40:11,589 --> 01:40:13,011
<i>Gerry...</i>

850
01:40:17,929 --> 01:40:21,274
<i>- It's the rules. Hard hat area.
- Thanks.</i>

851
01:40:21,349 --> 01:40:23,443
<i>Follow the signs.</i>

852
01:40:31,400 --> 01:40:33,573
<i>Move it. You're late!</i>

853
01:40:35,780 --> 01:40:37,874
<i>You two, come here.</i>

854
01:40:38,908 --> 01:40:40,956
<i>Give us a hand unloading this.</i>

855
01:40:41,035 --> 01:40:42,582
<i>OK, leave it there.</i>

856
01:40:42,662 --> 01:40:46,792
<i>Get a coffee over at the hut.
Come back in 20 minutes.</i>

857
01:40:48,793 --> 01:40:51,467
<i>It's women's lib.
They're taking over the Teamsters.</i>

858
01:40:54,715 --> 01:40:58,140
<i>OK, get this stuff movin'!
We're an hour late.</i>

859
01:41:09,897 --> 01:41:12,150
<i>I should take a closer look at that mine.</i>

860
01:41:12,858 --> 01:41:14,986
<i>{Stacey} Ahem!</i>

861
01:41:15,486 --> 01:41:17,284
<i>What's stopping you?</i>

862
01:41:20,157 --> 01:41:24,253
<i>That's a good idea of yours.
Pity you couldn't find one that fits.</i>

863
01:41:31,210 --> 01:41:33,338
<i>Why walk when you can ride?</i>

864
01:41:33,963 --> 01:41:36,261
<i>Keep it coming, keep it coming.</i>

865
01:41:37,675 --> 01:41:39,177
<i>OK, let's go.</i>

866
01:41:42,555 --> 01:41:44,478
<i>Will you keep still!</i>

867
01:41:44,557 --> 01:41:46,901
<i>Do you know what I'm sitting on?</i>

868
01:41:49,895 --> 01:41:51,442
<i>I'm trying not to think about it.</i>

869
01:42:06,704 --> 01:42:09,833
<i>{Tannoy} Stand clear. Stand clear.</i>

870
01:42:11,542 --> 01:42:17,174
<i>All personnel not on essential duties,
leave underground area immediately.</i>

871
01:42:22,928 --> 01:42:25,397
<i>Standby crew, we need you up here.</i>

872
01:42:33,939 --> 01:42:35,691
<i>Ready to unload.</i>

873
01:42:41,614 --> 01:42:43,241
<i>OK, stand clear.</i>

874
01:42:46,952 --> 01:42:49,080
<i>Let's go, standby crew.</i>

875
01:42:52,249 --> 01:42:55,048
<i>Break off. Stand clear.</i>

876
01:43:05,554 --> 01:43:09,775
<i>Standby forward. Bring the gag
up here and clear these barriers away.</i>

877
01:43:14,605 --> 01:43:17,859
<i>{Conley} Come on, let's go.
We haven't got all day.</i>

878
01:43:19,985 --> 01:43:21,987
<i>Clear the safety barrier.</i>

879
01:43:28,411 --> 01:43:30,288
<i>{Conley} Come on, move!</i>

880
01:43:31,497 --> 01:43:34,501
<i>Hey, on the crane!
Swing the cradle over here.</i>

881
01:43:35,918 --> 01:43:37,795
<i>Take it off. Take it off.</i>

882
01:43:55,062 --> 01:43:56,609
<i>{ticking}</i>

883
01:44:00,526 --> 01:44:02,870
<i>Bring it over. Bring it over. Easy.</i>

884
01:44:03,154 --> 01:44:04,701
<i>Good, good.</i>

885
01:44:07,450 --> 01:44:10,454
<i>{Conley continues instructions}</i>

886
01:44:12,747 --> 01:44:16,047
<i>- You found anything?
- Yes. I think I have.</i>

887
01:44:19,503 --> 01:44:20,925
<i>Good.</i>

888
01:44:21,672 --> 01:44:23,174
<i>Good. Hold 'em.</i>

889
01:44:34,268 --> 01:44:37,863
<i>OK, get those wedges in there tight!</i>

890
01:44:52,411 --> 01:44:55,415
<i>{foreman} Come on,
lay the head down here. OK?</i>

891
01:44:55,998 --> 01:45:00,845
<i>The San Andreas Lake is right above us.
Lots of seepage. Could ï¬‚ood any minute.</i>

892
01:45:01,545 --> 01:45:05,220
<i>Finish shoring up the roof.
I'll send the lug back.</i>

893
01:45:05,758 --> 01:45:07,101
<i>OK.</i>

894
01:45:07,176 --> 01:45:09,725
<i>Bring up some timber, on the double!</i>

895
01:45:17,978 --> 01:45:19,730
<i>{Stacey} He'll kill millions.</i>

896
01:45:21,106 --> 01:45:24,451
<i>These green lights - they're Zorin's oil wells.</i>

897
01:45:25,027 --> 01:45:28,748
<i>The ones he's been using to pump
sea water into the Hayward fault.</i>

898
01:45:29,156 --> 01:45:31,454
<i>What are these tunnels for
under these lakes?</i>

899
01:45:31,867 --> 01:45:35,963
<i>These lead straight into this section
of the San Andreas fault.</i>

900
01:45:36,413 --> 01:45:41,761
<i>Zorin just has to blast through the
bottom of these lakes to flood the fault.</i>

901
01:45:42,294 --> 01:45:46,470
<i>- And create a...double earthquake?
- Yes. Except...</i>

902
01:45:47,424 --> 01:45:50,644
<i>Except right beneath us
is the key geological lock</i>

903
01:45:50,719 --> 01:45:53,563
<i>that keeps the faults from moving at once.</i>

904
01:45:55,641 --> 01:45:57,188
<i>Hey, let's go!</i>

905
01:46:11,365 --> 01:46:15,245
<i>All those explosives.
Would they be enough to break the lock?</i>

906
01:46:15,911 --> 01:46:17,538
<i>Of course!</i>

907
01:46:18,455 --> 01:46:22,130
<i>If they go off, both faults move at once.</i>

908
01:46:22,334 --> 01:46:26,214
<i>Silicon Valley and everything in it
submerged for ever.</i>

909
01:46:26,297 --> 01:46:30,803
<i>If it happened at the peak of
the spring tide for maximum effect...</i>

910
01:46:36,223 --> 01:46:39,443
<i>That's today at 9.41. In less than an hour!</i>

911
01:46:39,977 --> 01:46:43,106
<i>- We have to go and warn people.
- Wait!</i>

912
01:46:49,069 --> 01:46:50,286
<i>Stand back.</i>

913
01:46:53,741 --> 01:46:55,163
<i>Jump!</i>

914
01:46:59,580 --> 01:47:01,253
<i>{klaxon}</i>

915
01:47:05,377 --> 01:47:06,469
<i>Get him.</i>

916
01:47:16,889 --> 01:47:19,517
<i>- Get 'em back to work.
- You men, get back to work.</i>

917
01:47:22,895 --> 01:47:24,238
<i>It's Bond.</i>

918
01:47:25,105 --> 01:47:27,073
<i>Close up the entrance. Nobody gets out.</i>

919
01:47:29,151 --> 01:47:30,368
<i>Hold it!</i>

920
01:47:31,028 --> 01:47:32,450
<i>In.</i>

921
01:47:41,747 --> 01:47:43,169
<i>Aagghh!</i>

922
01:47:43,248 --> 01:47:44,500
<i>Come on.</i>

923
01:47:45,250 --> 01:47:50,051
<i>- Did you pass anyone back there?
- No. I saw no one.</i>

924
01:47:54,009 --> 01:47:56,182
<i>- Now which way?
- The map.</i>

925
01:48:03,519 --> 01:48:05,647
<i>There's a draught from up there.</i>

926
01:48:05,729 --> 01:48:07,231
<i>- It must be a ventilation shaft.
- Wait!</i>

927
01:48:10,359 --> 01:48:12,032
<i>{Stacey gasps}</i>

928
01:48:18,200 --> 01:48:21,295
<i>That must lead to the fault.
The water from the lakes!</i>

929
01:48:21,370 --> 01:48:23,372
<i>Yes. And it'll be flooding any moment.</i>

930
01:48:26,917 --> 01:48:27,964
<i>Come on.</i>

931
01:48:38,345 --> 01:48:40,018
<i>You two, that way.</i>

932
01:49:03,495 --> 01:49:05,418
<i>Give me your hand.</i>

933
01:49:27,311 --> 01:49:29,530
<i>It's time to flood the fault.</i>

934
01:49:34,985 --> 01:49:36,953
<i>But... May Day. And my men.</i>

935
01:49:37,446 --> 01:49:39,369
<i>Yeah. A convenient coincidence.</i>

936
01:49:40,157 --> 01:49:42,501
<i>Mr Zorin, those men are loyal to you.</i>

937
01:49:49,750 --> 01:49:50,842
<i>{gasps}</i>

938
01:49:50,918 --> 01:49:51,965
<i>Hurry!</i>

939
01:49:53,754 --> 01:49:56,177
<i>- Get help. Quick!
- Get a doctor.</i>

940
01:50:07,976 --> 01:50:09,523
<i>Aauugghh!</i>

941
01:50:15,234 --> 01:50:16,907
<i>{Stacey screams}</i>

942
01:50:29,873 --> 01:50:31,716
<i>{panicked cries}</i>

943
01:50:33,627 --> 01:50:36,176
<i>{worker} Come on, run for your life!</i>

944
01:50:45,806 --> 01:50:47,979
<i>{workers attend Conley}</i>

945
01:50:48,684 --> 01:50:50,561
<i>Give me some spare clips.</i>

946
01:51:30,976 --> 01:51:32,478
<i>Keep climbing!</i>

947
01:51:48,035 --> 01:51:49,412
<i>Keep going!</i>

948
01:52:04,092 --> 01:52:05,139
<i>James!</i>

949
01:52:46,134 --> 01:52:48,307
<i>Good. Right on schedule.</i>

950
01:52:54,559 --> 01:52:55,856
<i>Let's go.</i>

951
01:53:18,542 --> 01:53:20,670
<i>{Zorin chuckles}</i>

952
01:53:31,930 --> 01:53:34,399
<i>And I thought that creep loved me!</i>

953
01:53:35,267 --> 01:53:37,520
<i>You're not the only one he double-crossed.</i>

954
01:53:54,286 --> 01:53:56,914
<i>All outboard valves fully locked, sir.</i>

955
01:54:18,977 --> 01:54:20,604
<i>The water level's dropping.</i>

956
01:54:28,278 --> 01:54:29,746
<i>Pump pressure good.</i>

957
01:54:41,750 --> 01:54:43,878
<i>{May Day gasps} Jenny!</i>

958
01:54:43,960 --> 01:54:47,339
<i>Come on. There's nothing
you can do for them now.</i>

959
01:54:56,139 --> 01:54:58,858
<i>- Up and away!
- {Zorin cackles}</i>

960
01:55:35,846 --> 01:55:39,225
<i>{Zorin} Silicon Valley. Perfect!</i>

961
01:55:40,183 --> 01:55:42,311
<i>Hold position here.</i>

962
01:55:43,520 --> 01:55:48,242
<i>Only minutes more, Carl.
Nothing can stop it now.</i>

963
01:55:49,359 --> 01:55:53,114
<i>The greatest cataclysm in history.</i>

964
01:55:53,697 --> 01:55:57,042
<i>And all attributed to natural causes.</i>

965
01:55:58,827 --> 01:56:00,829
<i>Exactly.</i>

966
01:56:03,540 --> 01:56:05,042
<i>We must hurry.</i>

967
01:56:07,419 --> 01:56:09,717
<i>I have to get down
and defuse that detonator.</i>

968
01:56:09,838 --> 01:56:12,341
<i>You can't. The time has been booby trapped.</i>

969
01:56:12,424 --> 01:56:15,052
<i>If you tamper with it we're going to blow up.</i>

970
01:56:15,177 --> 01:56:18,431
<i>Then we have to bring
the whole thing up. But how?</i>

971
01:56:18,555 --> 01:56:21,183
<i>Get on the rig. I'll lower you down.</i>

972
01:56:21,266 --> 01:56:22,483
<i>Get on!</i>

973
01:56:48,710 --> 01:56:50,383
<i>Keep going!</i>

974
01:56:50,462 --> 01:56:52,089
<i>Come on. Come on.</i>

975
01:56:54,925 --> 01:56:56,142
<i>OK, hold it there.</i>

976
01:57:04,184 --> 01:57:05,606
<i>Take it up!</i>

977
01:57:06,102 --> 01:57:08,946
<i>- Get on!
- It's too heavy. Go!</i>

978
01:57:09,064 --> 01:57:10,281
<i>Get on, dammit!</i>

979
01:57:14,611 --> 01:57:15,783
<i>OK, go!</i>

980
01:57:17,781 --> 01:57:19,829
<i>{winch rattles}</i>

981
01:57:39,803 --> 01:57:41,305
<i>Keep going!</i>

982
01:57:58,154 --> 01:57:59,656
<i>{Bond} That's it.</i>

983
01:58:00,323 --> 01:58:02,417
<i>Swing it over to the truck.</i>

984
01:58:07,330 --> 01:58:09,458
<i>Easy. Gently!</i>

985
01:58:14,045 --> 01:58:15,672
<i>Right, lower it.</i>

986
01:58:18,008 --> 01:58:19,385
<i>Take her up.</i>

987
01:58:19,968 --> 01:58:25,725
<i>We've only seconds before this blows.
If it does, that powder keg goes with it.</i>

988
01:58:39,321 --> 01:58:41,198
<i>The handbrake slipped.</i>

989
01:58:45,243 --> 01:58:47,211
<i>Push! Push!</i>

990
01:58:50,206 --> 01:58:53,380
<i>- Jump!
- I have to hold the brake off.</i>

991
01:58:53,585 --> 01:58:54,632
<i>Jump!</i>

992
01:58:55,211 --> 01:58:57,339
<i>Get Zorin for me!</i>

993
01:58:58,882 --> 01:59:00,509
<i>May Day, jump!</i>

994
01:59:02,552 --> 01:59:03,895
<i>Only seconds to go.</i>

995
01:59:04,679 --> 01:59:06,306
<i>May Day, jump!</i>

996
01:59:10,727 --> 01:59:11,819
<i>May Day!</i>

997
01:59:41,591 --> 01:59:42,763
<i>James.</i>

998
01:59:44,344 --> 01:59:45,391
<i>James!</i>

999
01:59:46,137 --> 01:59:47,480
<i>James!</i>

1000
01:59:59,567 --> 02:00:01,820
<i>Stacey, behind you! Get down!</i>

1001
02:00:02,904 --> 02:00:05,077
<i>James! {screams}</i>

1002
02:00:12,163 --> 02:00:14,382
<i>Come on, get in. Get up here!</i>

1003
02:00:17,127 --> 02:00:20,131
<i>The ship's nose is heavy.
He must be on the mooring rope.</i>

1004
02:01:08,636 --> 02:01:09,808
<i>Ohhh!</i>

1005
02:01:32,827 --> 02:01:35,046
<i>This'll hurt him more than me.</i>

1006
02:02:18,039 --> 02:02:19,416
<i>More! More power.</i>

1007
02:02:24,045 --> 02:02:25,467
<i>{creaking}</i>

1008
02:02:28,049 --> 02:02:29,676
<i>More. Do it!</i>

1009
02:02:31,052 --> 02:02:33,100
<i>{creaking}</i>

1010
02:02:40,937 --> 02:02:42,610
<i>{engine roars}</i>

1011
02:02:45,942 --> 02:02:47,444
<i>Full throttle!</i>

1012
02:02:48,111 --> 02:02:49,738
<i>{creaking}</i>

1013
02:02:52,323 --> 02:02:54,121
<i>Ohhh!</i>

1014
02:02:57,787 --> 02:02:59,380
<i>Right rudder. Do it!</i>

1015
02:03:11,467 --> 02:03:12,764
<i>Stop it!</i>

1016
02:03:12,844 --> 02:03:15,017
<i>Get her off. Get her off!</i>

1017
02:03:15,138 --> 02:03:18,768
<i>- Stop it! Are you crazy?
- Get her off. Get away!</i>

1018
02:03:36,409 --> 02:03:37,501
<i>Go get him.</i>

1019
02:03:40,038 --> 02:03:41,085
<i>Go!</i>

1020
02:03:52,717 --> 02:03:54,060
<i>Stacey, jump!</i>

1021
02:03:59,182 --> 02:04:01,355
<i>- Get a foothold!
- {screams}</i>

1022
02:05:05,415 --> 02:05:08,385
<i>Max! Max!</i>

1023
02:05:14,298 --> 02:05:16,426
<i>Aaaggghh!</i>

1024
02:05:20,596 --> 02:05:22,769
<i>James! James!</i>

1025
02:05:23,725 --> 02:05:25,853
<i>Stacey, give me your hand.</i>

1026
02:05:27,937 --> 02:05:29,780
<i>Get under the pipe.</i>

1027
02:05:38,072 --> 02:05:39,619
<i>OK, stay there.</i>

1028
02:05:52,795 --> 02:05:54,047
<i>James, look out!</i>

1029
02:06:07,310 --> 02:06:08,436
<i>Stacey, hold tight!</i>

1030
02:06:10,104 --> 02:06:12,152
<i>{panicked gabbling}</i>

1031
02:06:21,324 --> 02:06:23,918
<i>- Stacey, are you there?
- You betcha!</i>

1032
02:06:37,673 --> 02:06:41,177
<i>- Are you all right?
- {Stacey} Yes. Yes.</i>

1033
02:06:43,221 --> 02:06:45,849
<i>There's never a cab when you want one.</i>

1034
02:06:48,059 --> 02:06:51,188
<i>The Order of Lenin, for Comrade Bond.</i>

1035
02:06:51,312 --> 02:06:54,282
<i>The first time ever awarded
to a non-Soviet citizen.</i>

1036
02:06:55,358 --> 02:06:59,283
<i>I'd have expected the KGB to celebrate
if Silicon Valley had been destroyed.</i>

1037
02:07:00,530 --> 02:07:02,874
<i>On the contrary, Admiral.</i>

1038
02:07:04,867 --> 02:07:07,871
<i>Where would Russian
research be without it?</i>

1039
02:07:11,833 --> 02:07:14,552
<i>Is Commander Bond here?
I'd like to thank him personally.</i>

1040
02:07:15,378 --> 02:07:19,224
<i>{M} Sadly he's missing.
We are continuing our search,</i>

1041
02:07:19,340 --> 02:07:21,559
<i>but must presume the worst.</i>

1042
02:07:57,420 --> 02:07:59,468
<i>{amorous laughter}</i>

1043
02:08:02,675 --> 02:08:06,179
<i>{Bond} A bit of soap here...
and a little soap there!</i>

1044
02:08:06,262 --> 02:08:09,391
<i>- Oh, drat! I've dropped the soap.
- {Stacey} I'll get it. Whoo!</i>

1045
02:08:10,099 --> 02:08:12,443
<i>{Bond} That is not the soap.</i>

1046
02:08:19,233 --> 02:08:20,780
<i>{phone rings}</i>

1047
02:08:20,943 --> 02:08:23,867
<i>- Hello?
- {M} Grandfather calling Q.</i>

1048
02:08:23,946 --> 02:08:26,870
<i>- What's the position?
- 007 alive.</i>

1049
02:08:26,949 --> 02:08:31,955
<i>- Where is he? What's he doing?
- Just cleaning up a few details.</i>

1050
02:08:32,872 --> 02:08:34,966
<i>{Stacey} Oh, James...</i>

1051
02:08:36,959 --> 02:08:39,587
<i>- Mmm!
- {Bond chuckles}</i>

1052
02:08:59,774 --> 02:09:01,868
<i>Meeting you</i>

1053
02:09:02,068 --> 02:09:05,447
<i>With a view to a kill</i>

1054
02:09:07,490 --> 02:09:11,586
<i>Face to face in secret places</i>

1055
02:09:11,661 --> 02:09:13,755
<i>Feel the chill</i>

1056
02:09:21,879 --> 02:09:25,099
<i>Nightfall covers me</i>

1057
02:09:25,883 --> 02:09:29,308
<i>But you know the plans I'm making</i>

1058
02:09:29,387 --> 02:09:33,017
<i>Still oversee</i>

1059
02:09:33,641 --> 02:09:38,488
<i>Could it be the whole earth opening wide?</i>

1060
02:09:40,856 --> 02:09:42,574
<i>A sacred why</i>

1061
02:09:42,858 --> 02:09:46,613
<i>A mystery gaping inside</i>

1062
02:09:48,489 --> 02:09:50,742
<i>The weekends why</i>

1063
02:09:51,200 --> 02:09:55,376
<i>But can we dance into the fire?</i>

1064
02:09:56,205 --> 02:10:00,085
<i>That fatal kiss is all we need</i>

1065
02:10:00,167 --> 02:10:03,011
<i>Dance into the fire</i>

1066
02:10:03,796 --> 02:10:07,721
<i>To fatal sounds of broken dreams</i>

1067
02:10:08,342 --> 02:10:10,720
<i>Dance into the fire</i>

1068
02:10:11,554 --> 02:10:15,434
<i>That fatal kiss is all we need</i>

1069
02:10:15,641 --> 02:10:18,520
<i>Dance into the fire</i>

1070
02:10:19,186 --> 02:10:21,280
<i>When all we see</i>

1071
02:10:21,564 --> 02:10:25,569
<i>ls the view to a kill</i>

1072
02:10:36,746 --> 02:10:39,374
<i>Dance into the fire</i>

1073
02:10:40,249 --> 02:10:42,343
<i>When all we see</i>

1074
02:10:42,710 --> 02:10:46,590
<i>ls the view to a kill</i>
