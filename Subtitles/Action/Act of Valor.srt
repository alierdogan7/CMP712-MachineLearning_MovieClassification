We had Weimy, our sniper.

171
00:11:49,679 --> 00:11:52,639
He grew up in the middle
of the Mojave Desert.

172
00:11:52,799 --> 00:11:55,479
Most excitement he found
as a kid was bowling frozen turkeys

173
00:11:55,639 --> 00:11:57,959
down the aisle at the grocery store.

174
00:11:59,479 --> 00:12:02,479
Ray, our comms guy, our radioman,

175
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:05,239
he grew up in East LA gangland.

176
00:12:05,399 --> 00:12:09,719
He had a Silver Star for pulling
a wounded teammate out of the fray.

177
00:12:09,879 --> 00:12:12,639
Sonny, he was made of granite.

178
00:12:12,799 --> 00:12:14,639
This guy didn't even do push-ups

179
00:12:14,799 --> 00:12:17,919
'cause he was afraid his chest
was gonna get too big.

180
00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:21,279
Ajayjoined the Teams
late in his 30s.

181
00:12:21,479 --> 00:12:23,679
He'd been a Muay Thai fighter
early in life.

182
00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:26,959
Before that, he grew up
dirt-poor in Trinidad.

183
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:31,239
Mikey had 20 years in the Teams.

184
00:12:31,399 --> 00:12:33,959
But as humble as he was,
you'd never even know it.

185
00:12:34,159 --> 00:12:38,359
He kept a picture of his wife in his helmet
and a lock of her hair in his pocket.

186
00:12:38,519 --> 00:12:40,399
Quiet as the breeze.

187
00:12:41,439 --> 00:12:43,079
And finally, Senior Chief.

188
00:12:43,239 --> 00:12:45,639
I couldn't really
tell you much about him...

189
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:48,159
...other than I'd rather
take a knife into a gunfight

190
00:12:48,319 --> 00:12:49,999
than have to be interrogated by him.

you think about how you could
have been a better dad,

197

I only got so many speeches

205
00:13:32,039 --> 00:13:35,759
...it's like Chief and I said right
at the beginning of this platoon:

206
00:13:35,919 --> 00:13:39,519
Once we step off on campaign, once this
bird's ready and we're downrange,

207
00:13:39,679 --> 00:13:41,959
everything back home
needs to be in balance.

208
00:13:42,119 --> 00:13:43,839
We're not gonna be worth a damn
to each other or ourselves

209
00:13:43,999 --> 00:13:45,679
if we get over there
and something's out of whack.

210
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:47,679
I mean, if things
aren't right with the family,

211
00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:50,639
things aren't right with the finances
or something's off,

212
00:13:50,799 --> 00:13:54,039
it's gonna put us all out of balance, so we
need to have that tight before we launch.

213
00:13:54,239 --> 00:13:56,079
If somebody's got an issue,
bring it up.

214
00:13:56,239 --> 00:13:59,279
Chief can take care of it, I can take care
of it. Everybody's got each other's back.

so when we're ready to roll,

two CIA agents, a Walter Ross
and a Miss Lisa Morales,

00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:56,559
were ambushed inside their

Unfortunately, Mr. Ross was murdered,

working cocaine-for-weapons deals

guerrillas, and the Mexican drug cartels

and Abu Shabal is still a little bit fuzzy,

but if this was the lead
that Morales was working on,

293
00:19:32,239 --> 00:19:34,639
it could be why
she was abducted. Senior?

294
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:37,519
All right, this is a personnel
recovery of Miss Morales.

295

296
00:19:40,479 --> 00:19:42,759

any updated source intel

297
00:19:42,919 --> 00:19:45,559
on numbers inside the camp,
and what about roving patrols?

298
00:19:45,759 --> 00:19:48,679
Maybe eight to ten, bro, but we don't
know anything about roving patrols.

299
00:19:48,839 --> 00:19:50,479
You're just gonna have to assume
that they're out there

300
00:19:50,679 --> 00:19:52,759
walking around, squared away.
They do this for a living, too.

301
00:19:52,919 --> 00:19:55,239
Senior, what kind ofweapons-on-target
are we looking at?

302
00:19:55,439 --> 00:19:57,559
Heavy weapons.
These guys are narco-traffickers,

303
00:19:57,719 --> 00:19:59,799
so they can have anything
from Soviet-bloc DShKs.

304
00:19:59,959 --> 00:20:02,719
They could have M2HP,
.50-cals out there, we don't know.

305
00:20:02,879 --> 00:20:05,999
So if there is a weapons' emplacement up
there, I suggest you guys bring rockets.

306
00:20:06,199 --> 00:20:09,719
Of course, rockets and foliage don't match,
so make sure you got a clear shot.

307
00:20:09,879 --> 00:20:13,559
- All right, what else?
- Any idea whether she's ambulatory or not?

308
00:20:13,719 --> 00:20:15,279
There was a ton of blood on the scene,

309
00:20:15,439 --> 00:20:17,839
and a lot of it was Mr. Ross',
we confirmed that.

310
00:20:18,039 --> 00:20:21,079
Miss Morales may have bled there, too,
but these guys are savages,

311
00:20:21,239 --> 00:20:23,799
so you're gonna have to assume
that she is non-ambulatory,

312
00:20:23,959 --> 00:20:26,239

to bring stuff to carry her out.
