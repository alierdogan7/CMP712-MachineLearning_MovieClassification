179
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:53,642
You'd be too if you'd been up
all night trying to sort this mess out.

180
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:03,008
Anything in particular, sir, or...?

181
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,002
Or are you just looking?

182
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:12,647
What I'm about to feed you, Solo,
might taste a little bitter.

183
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:16,165
Nevertheless, you're gonna have
to swallow it.

184
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:17,691
SOLO: Where are we going with this?

185
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:24,040
(GRUNTS)

186
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:30,048

187
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:50,364
(GRUNTING)

188
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:58,327
Adrian.

189
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,563
Kuryakin.

190
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:05,200
(SPEAKING IN RUSSIAN)

191
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:11,321
(GRUNTS)

192
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:14,765
What does that mean?

193
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:18,407
SANDERS: He said, "Don't kill
your partner on your first day."

194
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:20,801
I know what he said.

195
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:23,088
What does it mean?

196
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:27,563
SANDERS: The main ingredient
of an atom bomb is enriched uranium.

197
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:30,082
Dr. Teller was on the verge
of a breakthrough...

198
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:32,447
which would massively simplify
this process.

199
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:36,889
Making it possible for almost anyone
to build a nuclear device.

200
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,402
SANDERS: We believe that the Vinciguerra
Shipping and Aerospace Company in Rome...

201
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:46,281
where Miss Teller's Uncle Rudi
is a senior executive...

202
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:51,128
is, in fact, the cover for an
international criminal organization...

203
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:52,725
with ties to former Nazis.

204
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:58,206
The founder, Sergio Vinciguerra, was
a friend of Mussolini and a known fascist.

205
00:19:58,360 --> 00:19:59,407
Rumor has it...

206
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:02,609
Sergio was responsible
for smuggling the Nazis' gold...

207
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:04,450
to South America after the war.

208
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:09,329
It is now run by his son, Alexander,
and his wife, Victoria.

209
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:12,364
Al, he's more playboy than tycoon.

210
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:13,927
But she...

211
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:16,890
Well, now,
she's something else altogether.

212
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:20,568
All our information indicates
a lethal combination...

213
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,802
of beauty, brains and ambition.

214
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:25,730
She's the real fanatic.

215
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:28,966
Now that the old man is dead...

216
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:31,642
she's running the show.

217
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:36,889
We believe they're responsible
for Dr. Teller's disappearance.

218
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:39,326
Now...

219
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:43,931
imagine the consequences
if he builds an atom bomb for them.

220
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:46,321
We have no choice
but to work together on this.

221
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:51,245
Your mission is to infiltrate
this organization...

222
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:53,971
and to retrieve Dr. Teller
and his research.

223
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:57,690
It will be located on a computer disk.

224
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:00,170
And whoever has that disk...

225
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:04,368
will simply be the most powerful nation
in the world.

226
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:09,530
You, Solo, are to investigate Victoria
and Alexander Vinciguerra.

227
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:14,447
Our Russian friend will focus
on Miss Teller and her Uncle Rudi.

228
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:18,531
We'll leave you two to get acquainted.

229
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:22,285
Oleg.

230
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:25,008
Give my regards to Nina.

231
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:35,047
Obviously, I was briefed about you.

232
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:38,010
Your corrupt and criminal background...

233
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:42,404
until you were caught and the CIA
blackmailed you into working for them.

234
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:46,049
But what interests me,
given your profile...

235
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:50,882
is what would motivate you to become
the CIA's most effective agent.

236
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:53,401
I concluded it must be...

237
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:56,484
to counteract the humiliation
of knowing your balls...

238
00:21:56,640 --> 00:22:00,247
are at the end of a very long leash
held by a very short man.

239
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:05,245
I'm sure you understand humiliation.
Better than most.

240
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:06,640
Really?

241
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:10,403
- How so?
- Well, after your performance last night...

242
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:13,211
I thought I should read up on you.

243
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:17,001
Rather a sad story, what with your dad
being a big pal of Stalin's...

244
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:20,528
and a top government official
with all the perks and privileges...

245
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:23,650
right up until he was caught
embezzling party funds.

246
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:26,087
How old were you
when he was sent to the Gulag?

247
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:27,687
Ten?

248
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:29,604
Eleven years old?

249
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:35,281
Was that when the psychotic
episodes started?

250
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:37,968
You did, however, rise above it.

251
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:39,406
Special forces. KGB.

252
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:43,281
The youngest man to join, in fact,
and their best within three years.

253
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:47,331
I do wonder if it was your father's shame
that gave you such drive, though.

254
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:48,811
Or...

255
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:51,284
was it your mother's reputation?

256
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:55,243
I understand that she was...

257
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:58,210
extremely popular
amongst your father's friends...

258
00:22:58,360 --> 00:23:00,966
after he was shipped off to Siberia.

259
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:20,326
GABY: America is teaming up with Russia.

260
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:22,327
Is this a joke?

261
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:25,324
It should tell you
how important this mission is.

262
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:27,005
To everyone.

263
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:36,928
I'm not going back behind that Wall.

264
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:40,171
And at the end of this,
that's what they'll want.

265
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:43,130
You don't have to go anywhere
that you don't want to go.

266
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:44,520
You're the star of this show...

267
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:47,001
My woman would never wear
anything like that.

268
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:48,491
What's he doing here?

269
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:50,688
SOLO: I told you, we're teaming up
with the Russians.

270
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:53,207
Doesn't get any more Russian
than the Red Peril here.

271
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:55,169
And why did he call me his woman?

272
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:57,524
Because I am now your fiancé.

273
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:01,124
(CHUCKLES)

274
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:05,325
No, no, no.

275
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:07,211
No!

276
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:10,043
Smoothly done.

277
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:16,049
Gaby. Gaby. Wait.

278
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:18,123
Give me a minute to explain.

279
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:19,406
It's your cover.

280
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:23,571
He's an architect designing a resort for
heroes of the Soviet Union by the Black Sea.

281
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:26,803
The Russian Minister of Culture has
a weakness for classical architecture...

282
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:29,440
and he's sending your man there
to Rome to study.

283
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:33,127
He's also managed to secure a visa
for his fiancée.

284
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:37,006
And, naturally, you'd introduce him
to your beloved Uncle Rudi.

285
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:40,684
And what about you? What's your cover?

286
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:44,845
Jack Deveny. Antiquities dealer,
specializing in Greek and Roman sculpture.

287
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:48,249
The Vinciguerra family happen to have
one of the finest collections in the world.

288
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:52,770
You're asking too much of me.

289
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:54,410
You'll do fine.

290
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:56,571
No.

291
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:04,049
- These dresses are all in your size.
- Excuse me?

292
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:07,643
Soviet architect traveling to Rome...

293
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:10,849
would never dress his woman
in the clothes you tried to put her in.

294
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:13,767
You tried to dress her like someone
on your side thinks...

295
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:15,524
someone dress behind the Iron Curtain.

296
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:17,364
She's from behind the Iron Curtain.

297
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:19,409
That doesn't mean
she want to bring it with her.

298
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:21,562
We need two purses, please.
An everyday and clutch.

299
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:22,767
And grab that belt.

300
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:24,770
Uh, no.

301
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:26,689
No, not the Dior, the Rabanne.

302
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:30,208
You can't put a Paco Rabanne belt
on a Patou.

303
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:32,408
- She's not going to wear a Patou.
- What's wrong with a Patou?

304
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:34,403
Nothing. If you're fat.

305
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:36,130
The Dior goes with the Rabanne.

306
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:38,801
It won't match.

307
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:44,243
It doesn't have to match.

308
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:46,368
GABY:
Have you seen the price of this handbag?

309
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:48,608
It costs more than my car.

310
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:53,043
You can get back
on your horse now, cowboy.

311
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:56,802
I'll see you in Rome.

312
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:02,491
Not bad.

313
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:06,888
I like this. Yes.

314
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:09,321
But it's missing...

315
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:11,331
a little something.

316
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:15,164
Now we are engaged.

317
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:17,325
Congratulations.

318
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:46,364
- Enjoy your stay, Mr. Waverly.
- WAVERLY: I hope so.

319
00:26:57,880 --> 00:27:00,042
Jack Deveny. Checking in.

320
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:02,726
- Welcome to Rome, Mr. Deveny.
- Thank you.

321
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:09,649
I have a quick errand to run.

322
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:11,802
Could you have my bag taken
to my room, please?

323
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:14,361
- Of course.
- Thank you.

324
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:16,567
Luigi.

325
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:18,484
(BELL TOLLING)

326
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:21,044
GABY: Where are we going?

327
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:25,406
The same place every architect goes
when they visit Rome.

328
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:27,724
To see the sights.

329
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:29,325
GABY: Mm.

330
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:31,926
So, Mr. Architect...

331
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:34,562
I'm sure you've done your homework.

332
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:37,771
Why don't you tell me a bit
about the Steps.

333
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:43,321
Good question.

334
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:47,041
The Steps were constructed in 1723...

335
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:51,603
credited to two Italian architects.

336
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:54,363
Really, built by Russian.

337
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:57,602
Sergei Ivanov.

338
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:02,730
Now, Sergei also had mother, Yagoda...

339
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:05,565
who introduced him
to classical architecture...

340
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:08,291
and whom he revered as his muse.

341
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:12,764
Unfortunately for Sergei, his mother died
in the middle of construction.

342
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:15,201
So in memory of his beloved Yagoda...

343
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:18,284
he make one step
to celebrate every year...

344
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:20,283
of his mother's life.

345
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:23,408
So she died at 135.

346
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:28,047
No. She died at 100.

347
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:29,725
He was 35.

348
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:31,962
So 135 steps.

349
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:34,290
Impressive.

350
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:40,084
So she gave birth at the age of 65?

351
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:41,727
No.

352

Once upon a time,
there was a little boy.

You wouldn't describe him...

931
01:16:13,480 --> 01:16:16,484

He was neither tall nor handsome,

01:16:28,200 --> 01:16:30,009
he was bullied mercilessly...

936
01:16:30,160 --> 01:16:32,606
and relentlessly by the other children.

937
01:16:33,240 --> 01:16:35,561

938

as life continued to be a living hell.

939
01:16:38,800 --> 01:16:42,691
But what the other boys didn't
understand about their victim was...

940
01:16:42,840 --> 01:16:45,491
that he didn't see them as enemies.

941
01:16:46,360 --> 01:16:48,681
He saw them as instruments of learning.

942

01:25:23,440 --> 01:25:25,044
Well done, Solo, yep, yeah.

1065
01:25:25,200 --> 01:25:26,531
You got there in the end.

1066
01:25:26,920 --> 01:25:29,730

1067
01:25:48,160 --> 01:25:50,083
(IN ENGLISH) My father has been unwell.

1068
01:25:50,240 --> 01:25:53,847
That and the stress led to self-doubt.
He's ready now to resume his work.

1069
01:25:54,040 --> 01:25:56,646
- A daughter's touch.
- TELLER: Gaby has agreed to assist me.

1070

To assure I finish in time.

1071
01:26:01,000 --> 01:26:04,129
- Now that is a good idea.
- You're wrong.

1072
01:26:04,280 --> 01:26:07,204
The thing is, Kuryakin,
when Professor Teller disappeared...

1073
01:26:07,360 --> 01:26:11,081
we assumed his Nazi colleagues would
come knocking at his daughter's door...

1074
01:26:11,240 --> 01:26:13,208
so we recruited her, and waited.

1075
01:26:13,360 --> 01:26:15,567
And what we got, of course, was you two.

1076
01:26:15,720 --> 01:26:19,042
I've been meaning to thank you very much
for nearly fouling up two years of my work.

1077
01:26:19,200 --> 01:26:21,601
You're wrong.
I saw her betray us at Vinciguerra.

1078
01:26:21,760 --> 01:26:23,524
Yes. I told her to.

1079
01:26:23,960 --> 01:26:25,450
The meeting is confirmed.

WAVERLY:
I think you know what you have to do.

1081
01:26:28,200 --> 01:26:29,725
You were about to be exposed, Kuryakin.

1082

The only way she could stay in the game.

1083
01:26:31,640 --> 01:26:33,369
She knew the ring
you gave her was bugged...

1084
01:26:33,520 --> 01:26:35,443
and you'd be listening
to every word she said.

1085
01:26:35,600 --> 01:26:36,931
If you can catch him.

1086
01:26:37,080 --> 01:26:39,242
WAVERLY:
Give the average agent time to escape...

1087
01:26:40,120 --> 01:26:42,566

are you, Kuryakin? You're special.

1088

SOLO:
Let me translate this into English.

1089
01:26:44,600 --> 01:26:47,968
You told Gaby to drop us in it,
so you could find her father first.

1090
01:26:48,120 --> 01:26:52,125
But now you've lost her, so you need us
to help find her and finish the job.

1091
01:26:52,280 --> 01:26:55,124
Well, that is a very poor translation,
Solo, but...

1092
01:26:55,720 --> 01:26:59,645
Well, in a nutshell, yes, please,
thank you very much.

1093
01:26:59,960 --> 01:27:01,200
I think it's rather nice.

1094

and now we have a chance to save her, so...

1101
01:27:33,840 --> 01:27:35,001
So, what does that do?

1102
01:27:35,320 --> 01:27:36,845
Well, it's known as a coupler.

1103
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:38,968
It sends a signal
which enables another missile...

1104
01:27:39,120 --> 01:27:41,600
to lock onto this one
for double the impact.

1105
01:27:42,480 --> 01:27:46,451
It's left over from when this was a warhead
that contained conventional explosives.

1106
01:27:46,920 --> 01:27:49,321
Now that we are converting it
to nuclear, it's redundant.

1107
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:53,331
GABY: I'm sorry.

1108
01:28:02,680 --> 01:28:04,284

- What are you doing?
- Let's stop playing games, shall we?

1111
01:28:13,200 --> 01:28:14,770
Put her in a cell.

1112
01:28:14,920 --> 01:28:18,367
If you don't hear from me
in 20 minutes, kill her.

01:42:01,880 --> 01:42:03,484

1238

The coupling device that you so considerately
left us on your decoy warhead...

1239
01:42:19,880 --> 01:42:21,405
is accurate to 10 feet.

I have an idea
which might make things quicker.

1241
01:42:23,840 --> 01:42:25,046
It's known as a coupler.

01:42:25,240 --> 01:42:27,049
A signal, which enables
another missile...

1243
01:42:27,240 --> 01:42:29,402
to lock onto this one
for double the impact.

1244
01:42:29,560 --> 01:42:32,643
The coupling device is now activated,
and the bomb is armed.

a medium-size fishing boat.

1248
01:42:40,840 --> 01:42:43,684

1249
01:42:43,880 --> 01:42:45,564
- Ready.
- Yes, proceed, please, captain.

1251

giving you about 30 seconds
until impact.

1252
01:42:53,600 --> 01:42:55,329
It won't trigger the nuclear warhead...

1253
01:42:55,520 --> 01:42:56,681
as that requires fission.

No, that is probably not a good idea
for a British spy.
