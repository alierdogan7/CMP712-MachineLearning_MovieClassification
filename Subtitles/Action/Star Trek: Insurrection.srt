1
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:03,792
There he is! Let's get him.

2
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:10,470
Area 7 to Command. We could
use another survey team out here.

3
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:16,152
Ensigns McCauley and Gilles,
assist edaphology team in area 7.

4
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:18,316
Acknowledged.

5
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:40,991
Admiral Dougherty is waiting
for this. Transmit it to the ship.

6
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:44,237
Alert!
Area 12!

7
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:54,995
- The android is out ofcontrol.
- Report.

8
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:59,955
- He's headed toward the village.
- Over there!

9
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,958
Magnify.

10
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:14,039
Hold your fire.

11
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:16,708
What is it?

12
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:23,229
Base to Commander Data.

13
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:27,911
Re-routing microhydraulic
power distribution.

14
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:31,954
- Regulating thermal overload.
- Data, report immediately!

15
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:37,109
Transferring matrix functions.
Engaging secondary protocol.

16
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:39,595
He's trying to remove the headpiece.

17
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:43,588
All field units,
intercept the android.

18
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:51,630
Artim, it's all right.

19
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:58,636
Get inside.

20
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:15,195
Everyone get inside now.
Back to your homes.

21
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:20,671
- Secondary protocol is active.
- Stop him! Now!

22
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:36,073
Commander Data, stand down.
That's an order! Stand down!

23
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:11,432
Who are they?.

24
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:35,396
lt's an M-class planet.
Population 300 million.

25
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:39,752
- Say the greeting again.
- Yew-chin chef-faw.

26
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:43,714
You either need a new uniform
or a new neck.

27
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:48,277
- My collar size hasn't changed.
- Of course not!

28
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:52,075
Our guests
are eating the floral arrangements.

29
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:56,876
- No cocktails before dinner?.
- My God! Are they vegetarian?

30
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:02,240
Does the chef have a dressing
that goes well with chrysanthemums?

31
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:10,756
Captain Picard, Command wants
to know our ETA at the Goren system?

32
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:14,396
- The Goren system?
- Some territorial dispute.

33
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:19,628
lf we delay our trip to Hanoran ll,
it'll put us in the monsoon season.

34
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,592
Captain ...

35
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:27,033
- The diplomatic corps is busy.
- So we get to put out another fire.

36
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:32,473
Can anyone remember
when we used to be explorers?

37
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,315
Deck 10.

38
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:39,035
Remember, they're not
as advanced as we are.

39
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:44,155
- They've just achieved warp drive.
- Now they're a protectorate.

40
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:49,878
With the Borg and the Dominon,
we need all the allies we can get.

41
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:52,951
Captain on deck.

42
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:01,549
- Regent Cuzar like to dance.
- Can she mambo?

43
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:05,036
- Very funny.
- The Captain cuts quite a rug.

44
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:09,916
La Forge to Picard. l need to talk
to you before the reception.

45
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:13,635
Mr Worf!
What are you doing here?

46
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:16,593
Can it wait?

47
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:21,191
- Tell him to come up here.
- The Captain wants you to join us.

48
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:25,996
There's a communiqué from
Admiral Dougherty about Data.

49
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:39,317
Regent Cuzar, welcome aboard.

50
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:44,878
Captain Picard, l welcome you
in the tradition of my people.

51
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:57,792
We are so honoured to be accepted
within the great Federation family.

52
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,356
- We have a dance later.
- l look forward to it.

53
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:11,957
- Counsellor ..?
- Nice bead work.

54
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:18,429
Captain, Admiral Dougherty is aboard
a Son'a ship in sector 4-4-1 .

55
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:22,428
He's requesting Data's schematics.
He doesn't say why.

56
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:26,997
Data was only scheduled to observe
the Ba'ku village for a week.

57
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:31,591
Geordi, set up a secure com-link
to the Admiral.

58
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:36,430
Hars Adislo. We met at the
Nel Bato conference last year.

59
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:40,872
Did you read my paper
on thermionic transconductance?

60
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:43,594
Would you excuse me?

61
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:51,997
He's not acknowledging
any Starfleet protocol.

62
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:57,911
- What precipitated this behaviour?.
- l don't know. Now he has hostages.

63
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:01,078
We could be there in two days.

64
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:05,831
That's not a good idea. Your ship
hasn't been fitted for this region.

65
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:09,350
- There are environmental concerns.
- Such as?

66
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:13,951
We're studying various anomalies.
They call this area the Briar Patch.

67
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:17,550
We've had trouble
even getting a signal to you.

68
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:22,276
Just get me Data's schematics.
l'll keep you informed.

69
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:32,110
- His emotion chip?
- He didn't take it with him.

70
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:36,552
Send the Admiral Data's schematics.

71
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:42,756
Report to the galley and tell
the chef to skip the fish course.

72
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:46,191
l'd like our guests to depart
as soon as etiquette allows.

73
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:50,279
l'm going to ask Worf
to delay his return to DS9.

74
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:53,836
Sector 4-4-1 is on our way
to the Goren system.

75
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:58,318
- They are in opposite directions.
- Are they?.

76
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:20,396
l should never have let you
talk me into that duck blind.

77
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:25,037
Federation procedures have made this
more difficult than it needed to be.

78
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:30,758
We have to protect the planet's
population from unnecessary risk.

79
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:34,919
Planet's population?
600 people!

80
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:40,672
lf you want to avoid unnecessary
risks, leave your android at home.

81
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:45,829
- We are approaching the planet.
- Take us into a high orbit.

82
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:50,431
Lie down, the girls
will take 20 years off your face.

83
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:55,111
- Another time, perhaps.
- Your self-restraint puzzles me.

84
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:59,836
You deny yourself every benefit
this mission has to offer.

85
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:04,875
Such benefits are to be shared with
allthe people of the Federation.

86
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:14,554
- Report!
- Phaser blast. Unknown origin.

87
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:20,519
- Take us out of orbit.
- Photon torpedoes.

88
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:27,438
- The vessel has broken off pursuit.
- Visual contact.

89
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:33,749
That's our ship.

90
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:56,513
We're about to lose communications
with Starfleet.

91
00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:00,474
l have all the files on the
duck-blind mission and the Son'a.

92
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:04,639
You have two days to become experts.

93
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:09,318
Mr Worf, we need a plan
to safely capture Data.

94
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:14,640
La Forge has modified this tricorder
with one of Data's actuation servos.

95
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:18,879
lts range is only four metres,
but it will shut him down.

96
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:22,919
Good to have you back.

97
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:26,759
Take us in.

98
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:44,355
Half a century ago,
they conquered two primitive races -

99
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:48,155
- and integrated them into
their culture as a labour class.

100
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:57,472
The Son'a have produced quantities
of the narcotic ketracel-white.

101
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:04,113
Their ships are rumoured to be
equipped with outlawed weapons.

102
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:08,438
- Why are we involved with them?
- Good question.

103
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:13,479
You haven't done that in a while.

104
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:16,240
- What you're doing to my neck.
- What?

105
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:26,272
Bridge to Commander Worf.

106
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:29,438
- Worf!
- Captain.

107
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:34,475
How are things on DS9? Don't
officers report for duty on time?

108
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:44,829
- Sorry, sir. l'm on my way.
- We'll skip the court martial.

109
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:50,511
When was the last time
we aligned the torque sensors?

110
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:53,996
- Two months ago.
- They don't sound right.

111
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:59,638
They are out of alignment
by 12 microns. You could hear that?

112
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:03,879
When l was an ensign, l could
detect a 3-micron misalignment.

113
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:08,596
The Son'a ship with Adm. Dougherty
has entered tracking range.

114
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:13,749
Straighten your baldric.
On screen.

115
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:17,270
Captain, l wasn't expecting you.

116
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:20,756
This is important to the Enterprise.

117
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:25,909
Data attacked us in the mission
scoutship, yesterday.

118
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:29,999
Ru'afo and l have decided
to send in an assault team.

119
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:33,795
Worf and l are working out
a tactical plan ...

120
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:40,519
Your android damaged my ship.
He must be destroyed.

121
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:47,239
l know what Data means to Starfleet,
but our crew are in danger.

122
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:53,037
lf our attempt to capture Data
fails, l will terminate him.

123
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:57,791
l should be the one to do it.
l'm his captain and his friend.

124
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:05,753
All right, you have 12 hours, then
l want you out of the Briar Patch.

125
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:10,795
We'll head out to the perimeter
to call for Son'a reinforcements.

126
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,797
Understood.

127
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,719
Good luck. Dougherty out.

128
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:31,754
- We're not picking up any ships.
- Try a wide-band covariant signal.

129
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:34,599
The rings are masking his approach.

130
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:39,874
The metaphasic radiation from the
rings is in a state of extreme flux.

131
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:46,674
Come out, come out
whereveryou are ...

132
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:51,032
- Sir?.
- That's something my mother ...

133
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:54,673
Hold on.

134
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:05,918
Open all hailing frequencies.
Data, this is Captain Picard.

135
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:08,714
Please respond.

136
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:17,394
lf we fire tachyon bursts,
he'll have to reset his shields.

137
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:21,479
- Then we can beam him out.
- Make it so.

138
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:30,358
- Direct hit. His shields are down.
- Beam him out.

139
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:39,560
- He's using a transport inhibitor.
- Prepare to enter the atmosphere.

140
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:41,716
That will shake him.

141
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:53,069
- Scanners are off-line.
- Start evasive manoeuvres.

142
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:19,468
He can fly a ship and anticipate our
tactics. His brain is functioning.

143
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:24,549
We know how he responds to threats.
l wonder how he would respond ...

144
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:29,232
Do you know Gilbert & Sullivan?

145
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:34,036
No, l've not had a chance
to meet all the new crew members.

146
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:40,591
They're composers,
from the 19th century.

147
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:48,797
Data was rehearsing ''HMS Pinafore''
just before he left.

148
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:54,757
A Brltish taris a soaring soul
as free as a mountain bird

149
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:59,750
his fist should be ready to resist
a dictatorial word

150
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:01,871
Sing, Worf.

151
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:04,514
- his nose shouldpant
- and his lips should curl

152
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:07,871
- his cheeks should flame
- and his brow should furl

153
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:10,992
- his bosom should heave
- and his heart should glow

154
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:14,829
and his fist be ever ready
for a knockdown blow

155
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:18,589
his nose should pant
and his lips should curl

156
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:20,870
his cheeks should flame
and his brow should furl

157
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:23,310
his bosom should heave
and his heart should glow

158
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:26,796
and his fist be ever ready
for a knockdown blow

159
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,036
Prepare the docking clamps.

160
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:31,834
his eyes should flash
wlth an inborn fire

161
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:34,793
his brow wlth scorn be wrung

162
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,878
he never should bow down
to a domineering frown

163
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:41,072
or the tang ofa tyrant tongue

164
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:44,556
- his heart should stamp
- and his throat should growl

165
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:47,593
- his hair should curl
- and his face should scowl

166
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:50,872
- his eyes should flash
- and his breast protrude

167
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:55,073
and this should be
his customary attltude

168
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:58,750
his foot should stamp
and his voice should drop

169
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:01,918
his hair should curl
and his face ...

170
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:08,436
lf we do not release him,
he may destroy both vessels.

171
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:11,438
l'm not letting go of him.

172
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:20,270
- We must stabilise.
- All power to inertial dampers.

173
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:24,871
- The auto-sequencer is damaged.
- Transfer control to manual.

174
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:34,837
Auto-sequencer realigned.
Engaging stabilisers.

175
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:38,077
- Damping field established.
- Maximum power.

176
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:50,314
Now, Mr Worf.

177
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:06,510
Commander Data is safely in custody.

178
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:43,756
- Captain, Subahdar Gallatin.
- Lt. Curtis, Dougherty's attaché.

179
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:48,476
- Are you all right?
- We've been treated extremely well.

180
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:53,432
They have incredible
mental discipline and perception.

181
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:56,792
- My name is Sojef.
- Jean-Luc Picard.

182
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,468
Dr Crusher and Counsellor Troi.

183
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:04,708
- Would you like something to eat?
- No, we're here to rescue them.

184
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:10,391
As you wish. l would ask you
to disarm yourselves.

185
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:13,956
This village is a sanctuary of life.

186
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:19,313
Prepare the hostages for transport.

187
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:24,594
They should be quarantined before
joining the ship's population.

188
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:30,476
We believed they were being held
against their will.

189
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:35,196
lt's not our custom
to hold anyone against their will.

190
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:41,111
The android told us they were our
enemies, and that more would follow.

191
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:43,550
Are you our enemy?.

192
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:49,198
Non-interference in other cultures
is my people's prime directive.

193
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:54,315
Your directive apparently doesn't
include spying on other cultures.

194
00:22:55,920 --> 00:23:00,391
The android is a member of my crew.
Apparently, he was taken ill.

195
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:05,230
We were unable to repair the phase
variance in his positronic matrix.

196
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:10,594
The captain finds it hard to believe
we possess such technical skills.

197
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:15,920
Not applying our technological
abilities is a matter of choice.

198
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:21,069
Creating a machine to do man's work
takes something away from man.

199
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:25,159
At one time, we explored the galaxy,
just as you do.

200
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:29,478
- You have warp capability?.
- Capability, yes.

201
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:33,355
But where can warp drive take us
except away from here?

202
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:46,395
l apologise for our intrusion.

203
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:59,276
Because they have warp capability,
the consequences will be minimal.

204
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:04,235
Terrific job. Now pack your bags
and get the hell out of there.

205
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:09,673
- How's Data?
- La Forge is doing the diagnostic.

206
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:16,877
Rendez-vous with us to transfer
crew and equipment on your way out.

207
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:23,872
- You're not finished here?
- Just a few loose ends to tie up.

208
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:52,117
Come in.

209
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:58,915
- Have you got a minute?
- Sure.

210
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:04,433
- l need a little counselling.
- That's a first.

211
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:07,598
Do l lie down, or what?

212
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:13,272
Whatever makes you comfortable,
but it isn't a therapeutic posture.

213
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:17,519
- But it is comfortable.
- Why don't you try sitting up?

214
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:20,792
Why don't you try lying down?

215
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:26,393
You're in quite a mood today. Did
you just come down here to play?.

216
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:29,592
- l'm having a mid-life crisis.
- l believe you.

217
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:32,758
- l'm not sleeping well.
- Dr Crusher can help.

218
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:37,351
What l need
l can't get from Dr Crusher.

219
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:42,076
Can two people go back in time
and fix a mistake they've made?

220
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:45,636
On this ship, anything's possible.

221
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:50,589
Yuk!

222
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:56,989
- l never kissed you with a beard.
- l kiss you, and you say 'yuk'!

223
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:06,315
l reconstructed Data's neural net
and replaced these memory engrams.

224
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:12,197
- How were they damaged?
- By a Son'a weapon.

225
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:18,839
- He malfunctioned after they fired?
- l believe so.

226
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:26,674
- Why would they fire on him first?
- A shot caused him to malfunction.

227
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:29,952
His ethical subroutines
then took over.

228
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:34,073
So he still knew the difference
between right and wrong.

229
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:38,273
The system prevents anyone from
taking advantage of his memory loss.

230
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:42,268
Yet he attacked us
and told the Ba'ku we were a threat.

231
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:47,190
- Are the implants bothering you?
- No, l'm just tired.

232
00:26:56,160 --> 00:27:00,472
- Geordi? Captain?
- You're on the Enterprise, Data.

233
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:06,033
l seem to be missing
several memory engrams.

234
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:08,754
There they are.

235
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:15,589
What's the last thing you remember?.

236
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:20,794
- His nose should pant...
- From the mission.

237
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:25,039
l was gathering
phsyiometric data on the Ba'ku.

238
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:27,993
Some children walked into the hills.

239
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:39,710
Artim, where were you
the day the android appeared to us?

240
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:44,152
- ln the hills by the dam.
- Can you show us?

241
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:05,195
There is no reason to fear me. l am
operating within normal parameters.

242
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:08,551
They fixed me.

243
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:15,633
- The boy is afraid of me.
- lt's nothing personal.

244
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:22,234
- These people rejected technology.
- l am technology personified.

245
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:27,309
That young man has never seen
a machine that walks and talks.

246
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:37,316
Bridge to Riker.

247
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:41,832
- Can l get back to you, Worf?
- lt's Admiral Dougherty.

248
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:45,191
Patch him through.
Yes, Admiral?

249
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:49,951
- Why haven't you left orbit?
- Picard is still on the surface.

250
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:53,596
He wants an explanation
as to why Data malfunctioned.

251
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:56,837
His future at Starfleet
depends on it.

252
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:04,591
Remind the Captain
his 12 hours are up. Dougherty out.

253
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:10,679
Your body is producing
far too many toxins.

254
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:14,793
We've reached the limit
of genetic manipulation.

255
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:18,788
l won't need any more
genetic manipulation -

256
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:23,790
- if our Federation friends will
allow us to complete this mission.

257
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:35,916
Tricorder functions are limited due
to kelbonite deposits in the area.

258
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:40,352
How about a passive radiation scan?

259
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:47,477
There appear to be strong neutrino
emissions coming from the lake.

260
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:06,319
Can he breathe underwater?.

261
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:09,990
Data doesn't breathe.

262
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:14,910
- Won't he rust?
- No.

263
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:39,396
Captain!

264
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:43,673
l believe l know what is causing
the neutrino emissions.

265
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:24,233
The vessel
is clearly Federation in origin.

266
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:27,910
''Just a few loose ends
to tie up!''

267
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:32,553
- We're not interested in this.
- l am.

268
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:38,630
- lt would be wiser ...
- l'm going with you.

269
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:29,873
lt is a holographic projection.

270
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:35,440
lncomplete, l might add.

271
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:40,191
This is a computer-driven image
created by photons and forcefields.

272
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:43,676
l know what a hologram is.

273
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:47,714
Why would anyone want
to create one of our village?

274
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:52,152
lf you were following the children
and discovered this ship ...

275
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:57,028
l may have been shot to protect
the secret of its existence.

276
00:32:57,240 --> 00:33:02,394
Why would they duplicate this
village except to deceive the Ba'ku?

277
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:06,275
- Deceive us?
- To move you off this planet.

278
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:09,233
You'd fall asleep in your village -

279
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:13,149
- and wake up
on this flying holodeck.

280
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:16,796
Transported en masse,
and in a few days -

281
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:21,437
- relocated on a similar planet
without ever realising it.

282
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:26,077
Why would the Federation
wish to move the Ba'ku?

283
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:29,795
l don't know.

284
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:07,549
Computer, end program.
De-cloak the vessel.

285
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:11,393
Help!

286
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:14,956
l can't swim.

287
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:23,515
Don't panic.

288
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:27,998
l've been shot at on a ship
that has come to abduct us.

289
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:31,556
What's there to panic about?

290
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:36,670
For water landings, l am designed
to serve as a flotation device.

291
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:46,073
Did the hostages mention
anything about a cloaked ship?

292
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:48,999
- No, sir.
- Debrief them again.

293
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:54,558
- Have you been in a fight?
- No, it is a gorch.

294
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:59,035
A pimple, sir.

295
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:05,358
Well ... it's hardly noticeable.

296
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:22,836
Smooth as an android's bottom.

297
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:27,033
- Dougherty noticed we haven't left.
- We're not going anywhere.

298
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:30,038
Deck 5.

299
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:36,639
Klingons never do anything small.

300
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:41,755
- Dr Crusher asked to speak to you.
- Picard to Crusher.

301
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:46,954
The Son'a hostages
declined to be examined.

302
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:49,151
- And our people?
- They're fine.

303
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:55,469
ln fact they're better than fine.
lmproved muscle tone, high energy.

304
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:58,194
Very well, Doctor.

305
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:03,315
Don't release the Son'a officers
until l've talked to Ahdar Ru'afo.

306
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:07,274
Commander, may l ..?

307
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:15,709
Computer, music.

308
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:19,276
- Not that, something Latin.
- Specify.

309
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:22,199
The mambo.

310
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,594
That's more like it.

311
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:51,031
How old are you?

312
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:55,719
Our solar system was on the verge
of self-annihilation.

313
00:36:55,920 --> 00:37:00,198
Technology had created weapons
that threatened to destroy all life.

314
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:04,109
A small group of us
set off to find a new home.

315
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:09,633
A home that would be isolated
from the threats of other worlds.

316
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:15,631
- That was 309 years ago.
- And you haven't aged since then.

317
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:20,311
l was a lot older when we arrived,
in terms of my physical condition.

318
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:24,479
There's a metaphasic radiation
coming from the planet's rings.

319
00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:28,070
lt regenerates
our genetic structure.

320
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:33,513
- You must have noticed the effects.
- We've just begun to.

321
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:38,233
- l suppose you're 75.
- No, l'm 12.

322
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:43,833
The radiation won't affect him
until he reaches maturity.

323
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:50,229
What you have here is more valuable
than gold-pressed latinum.

324
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:55,673
That's the reason someone may be
trying to take your world from you.

325
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:58,838
The android was right.

326
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:04,239
lf it wasn't for Data, it's probable
that you would be relocated by now.

327
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:08,877
The moment we pick up a weapon
we become one of them.

328
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:12,550
- We lose everything we are.
- lt may not come to that.

329
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:17,435
The architects of this conspiracy
want to keep it a secret.

330
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:21,918
Not only from you,
but from my people, as well.

331
00:38:24,520 --> 00:38:27,159
l don't intend to let them.

332
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:37,473
We've always known that to survive
we had to remain apart.

333
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:42,515
Many of the young people want
to know more about the offland.

334
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:47,635
They're attracted to stories
of a faster pace of life.

335
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:53,631
Most of my people would
sell their souls to slow life down.

336
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:56,752
But not you?

337
00:38:56,960 --> 00:39:00,191
There are days.

338
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:04,998
You don't live up to your reputation
as an offlander.

339
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:10,354
ln defence of offlanders,
there are many more people like me.

340
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:16,032
Who wouldn't be tempted
by the promise of perpetual youth?

341
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:24,073
You give me more credit than
l deserve. Of course l'm tempted.

342
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:28,273
But some of the darkest chapters
in the history of my world -

343
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:35,272
- involve the forced relocation
of one people to satisfy another.

344
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:40,479
l had hoped that we had learned
from our mistakes, -

345
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:45,231
- but it seems
that some of us haven't.

346
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:58,157
- Extraordinary craftsmanship.
- lt's the work of students.

347
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:02,631
They're almost ready
to become apprentices.

348
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:07,630
ln 30 or 40 years
some of them will become artisans.

349
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:11,230
Apprenticing for 30 years ...

350
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:17,196
Did your people's mental discipline
develop here?

351
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:21,837
More questions.
Always the explorer.

352
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:27,954
- lf you stay, that will change.
- Will it?

353
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:34,197
You stop reviewing the past,
stop planning for tomorrow.

354
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:38,159
Let me ask you a question:

355
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:44,276
Have you ever experienced
a perfect moment in time?

356
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:49,429
When time seemed to stop, and you
could almost live in that moment?

357
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:58,438
Seeing my home planet from space,
for the first time.

358
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:01,677
Yes, exactly.

359
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:05,350
Nothing more complicated
than perception.

360
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:11,071
You explore the universe.

361
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:18,118
We discovered that a single moment
in time can be a universe in itself.

362
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:21,630
Full of powerful forces.

363
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:26,868
Most people aren't aware enough
of the nowto even notice.

364
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:31,551
l wish l could spare
a few centuries to learn.

365
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:36,754
lt took us centuries to learn that
it doesn't have to take that long.

366
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:40,111
There's one thing
l don't understand.

367
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:44,791
ln 300 years,
you never learned to swim?

368
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:48,390
l haven't got around to it yet.

369
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:59,193
l wonder if you're aware
of the trust you engender.

370
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:03,359
- lt's unusual ...
- For an offlander?.

371
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:07,155
For someone so young.

372
00:42:40,080 --> 00:42:44,471
- Geordi?
- Captain.

373
00:42:44,680 --> 00:42:48,309
There wasn't anything wrong
with my implants.

374
00:42:48,520 --> 00:42:52,832
There was something right
with my eyes.

375
00:42:55,600 --> 00:43:02,312
Dr Crusher found that the cells
around my optic nerve had ...

376
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:06,957
... started to regenerate.

377
00:43:08,200 --> 00:43:13,797
lt may not last.
And if it doesn't ...

378
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:18,278
... l just wanted, before we go ...

379
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:21,995
You know, l've never seen a sunrise.

380
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:26,591
At least not the way you see them.

381
00:43:53,480 --> 00:43:56,199
Come.

382
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:02,951
Am l to understand
that you're not releasing my men?

383
00:44:03,160 --> 00:44:06,835
We found the holoship.

384
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:11,477
- Let the captain and me ...
- No!

385
00:44:18,520 --> 00:44:23,310
This entire mission has been one
Federation blunder after another.

386
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:30,636
Return my men, or this alliance will
end with your ship's destruction.

387
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:43,676
You're looking well, Jean-Luc.
Rested.

388
00:44:43,880 --> 00:44:48,351
l won't let you move them. l will
take this to the Federation Council.

389
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:51,552
l'm acting on their orders.

390
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:54,558
To abandon our prime directive?

391
00:44:54,760 --> 00:45:00,471
These people are not indigenous.
They're not meant to be immortal.

392
00:45:00,680 --> 00:45:04,559
We'll be restoring them
to their natural evolution.

393
00:45:04,760 --> 00:45:08,799
Who the hell are we to determine
the course of evolution?

394
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,389
There are 600 people there.

395
00:45:11,600 --> 00:45:16,958
The regenerative properties of
this radiation could help billions.

396
00:45:17,160 --> 00:45:22,280
The Son'a can collect metaphasic
particles from the planet's rings.

397
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:28,077
- The planet is in Federation space.
- Our planet, their technology.

398
00:45:28,280 --> 00:45:33,434
A technology we can't duplicate.
You know what that makes us?

399
00:45:33,640 --> 00:45:41,274
- Partners.
- Our partners are petty thugs.

400
00:45:41,480 --> 00:45:45,712
On Earth, petroleum once turned
petty thugs into world leaders.

401
00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:53,156
Warp drive created a Romulan empire.
We can handle the Son'a.

402
00:45:53,360 --> 00:45:56,955
We probably said the same
about the Romulans.

403
00:45:57,160 --> 00:46:03,474
Lifespans will be doubled. An entire
new medical science will evolve.

404
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:07,639
Your chief engineer has the use
of his eyes for the first time.

405
00:46:07,840 --> 00:46:10,752
Will you take that away from him?

406
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:14,919
With the whole Briar Patch, why
does it have to be this one planet?

407
00:46:15,120 --> 00:46:19,352
The concentration in the rings
makes it work.

408
00:46:19,560 --> 00:46:23,633
They'll inject something into
the rings and start a reaction.

409
00:46:23,840 --> 00:46:31,076
- The planet will be uninhabitable.
- Delay them, let us study it.

410
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:36,070
Our best scientific minds
can't find any other way to do this.

411
00:46:36,280 --> 00:46:40,159
The Son'a can establish a separate
colony on the planet until we do.

412
00:46:40,360 --> 00:46:44,592
lt would take ten years' exposure
to reverse their condition.

413
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:48,156
Some of them
won't survive that long.

414
00:46:48,360 --> 00:46:52,478
Besides, who would want to live
in the Briar Patch?

415
00:46:52,680 --> 00:46:55,877
The Ba'ku.

416
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:03,669
We are betraying the principles upon
which the Federation was founded.

417
00:47:03,880 --> 00:47:07,998
lt's an attack upon its very soul.

418
00:47:15,560 --> 00:47:19,519
And it will destroy the Ba'ku.

419
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:27,515
Cultures have been destroyed in
every forced relocation in history.

420
00:47:27,720 --> 00:47:32,191
Jean-Luc,
we're only moving 600 people.

421
00:47:33,640 --> 00:47:38,191
How many people does it take
before it becomes wrong?

422
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:42,714
1 ,000?
50,000?

423
00:47:42,920 --> 00:47:46,959
A million?
How many people does it take?

424
00:47:47,160 --> 00:47:53,190
You'll proceed to the Goren system,
and release the Son'a officers.

425
00:47:53,400 --> 00:47:57,871
File whatever protests you wish to.

426
00:48:00,280 --> 00:48:04,637
By the time you do,
this will all be done.

427
00:48:52,040 --> 00:48:54,429
Gallatin!

428
00:48:54,640 --> 00:49:01,239
The righteous Starfleet captain
finally released you.

429
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:04,910
- Any problems on the surface?
- No, sir.

430
00:49:06,760 --> 00:49:10,514
But it wasn't easy being among them.

431
00:49:10,720 --> 00:49:14,110
Just don't forget
what they did to us.

432
00:49:16,280 --> 00:49:19,636
We'll have them rounded up
in a day or two.

433
00:49:19,840 --> 00:49:23,355
We needn't bother
with a holoship anymore.

434
00:49:23,560 --> 00:49:27,758
Get the holding cells ready.

435
00:49:27,960 --> 00:49:32,192
l'm going to miss these little
flesh-stretching sessions of ours.

436
00:49:54,520 --> 00:49:58,513
Re-routing the transport grid
to avoid detection was wise.

437
00:49:58,720 --> 00:50:02,872
However, the transporter
is rarely used after 02:00 hours.

438
00:50:03,080 --> 00:50:07,392
- Going out for a spin?
- Seven tons of explosives.

439
00:50:07,600 --> 00:50:11,479
Tetryon pulse launchers
and isomagnetic disintegrators.

440
00:50:11,680 --> 00:50:16,071
- A hunting trip?
- Return to your quarters.

441
00:50:16,280 --> 00:50:20,990
- That's an order.
- No uniform, no orders.

442
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:25,876
How can l look at a sunrise, knowing
what my sight cost these people?

443
00:50:26,080 --> 00:50:32,713
Exposure could stimulate rebellious
instincts common to youth -

444
00:50:32,920 --> 00:50:36,833
- which would affect everyone's
judgement ... except mine.

445
00:50:37,040 --> 00:50:40,669
What do you think we should do?

446
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:45,556
Saddle up.
Lock and load.

447
00:50:49,720 --> 00:50:53,235
They won't begin the procedure
while the planet is inhabited.

448
00:50:53,440 --> 00:50:57,194
Our job is to keep
the planet inhabited.

449
00:50:57,400 --> 00:51:02,030
We'll show what's happening here.
Make the Council see the Ba'ku.

450
00:51:02,240 --> 00:51:07,473
Then it won't be so easy to
turn a blind eye to their suffering.

451
00:51:07,680 --> 00:51:13,676
- l'll be back before you know it.
- We'll hold out as long as we can.

452
00:51:33,880 --> 00:51:37,509
The injector performs perfectly
in every simulation.

453
00:51:37,720 --> 00:51:42,555
The Enterprise left orbit, but a
support craft is on the surface.

454
00:51:42,760 --> 00:51:46,196
lt's the Captain's yacht.
Five persons on board.

455
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:50,757
We're not waiting. Get everyone
off the surface tonight.

456
00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:55,589
Gallatin.

457
00:51:55,800 --> 00:52:00,476
lf Picard or any of his people
interfere ... eliminate them.

458
00:52:06,760 --> 00:52:10,230
We're leaving the village.
Take only what you need.

459
00:52:10,440 --> 00:52:15,389
Bring food.
We may not be back for days.

460
00:52:26,720 --> 00:52:29,188
lt's a transport inhibitor.

461
00:52:29,400 --> 00:52:33,712
lt will prevent anyone
being beamed off the surface.

462
00:52:34,560 --> 00:52:38,473
Kelbonite in the hills will
interfere with their transporters.

463
00:52:38,680 --> 00:52:44,516
Where there aren't any deposits
we'll use transport inhibitors.

464
00:52:44,720 --> 00:52:47,473
The mountains are full of kelbonite.

465
00:52:47,680 --> 00:52:51,150
- Transport will be difficult there.
- There are caves in the mountains.

466
00:52:51,360 --> 00:52:57,435
Good, but they're not going
to make it easy for us to get there.

467
00:52:57,640 --> 00:53:03,237
Captain, we activated the transport
inhibitors around the village.

468
00:53:06,440 --> 00:53:09,238
Move these people out!

469
00:53:14,040 --> 00:53:18,795
- The transporters won't function.
- They're using inhibitors.

470
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:22,037
Locate and destroy them.

471
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:36,839
You're carrying too much.
We have a long climb ahead of us.

472
00:53:47,280 --> 00:53:51,956
Three transport inhibitors down.
There's a gap in the field.

473
00:54:26,680 --> 00:54:28,830
Father!

474
00:54:39,560 --> 00:54:43,030
Kelbonite deposits
are blocking our transporters.

475
00:54:43,240 --> 00:54:46,357
- Recommendations?
- Let me talk to Picard.

476
00:54:46,560 --> 00:54:50,314
Talk! We should send down
an assault team.

477
00:54:50,520 --> 00:54:55,275
lf people get hurt, all the support
we have in the Federation ...

478
00:54:55,480 --> 00:55:00,679
Federation support, Federation
procedures, Federation rules.

479
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:05,078
Look in the mirror,
the Federation is old.

480
00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:09,592
ln the past 24 months, they've been
challenged by every major power.

481
00:55:09,800 --> 00:55:12,553
The Borg, the Cardassians,
the Dominion.

482
00:55:12,760 --> 00:55:16,389
They all smell the scent of death
on the Federation.

483
00:55:16,600 --> 00:55:21,310
You embraced our offer
to give the Federation new life.

484
00:55:21,520 --> 00:55:27,117
How badly do you want it?
There are hard choices to be made.

485
00:55:27,320 --> 00:55:34,192
lf news gets through of your
captain's brave struggle, -

486
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:40,475
- Federation politicians will waver.
There will be a public debate.

487
00:55:40,680 --> 00:55:45,879
Federation allies will want
their say ... Need l go on?

488
00:55:46,080 --> 00:55:50,915
lsolinear tags would allow
our transporters to lock onto them.

489
00:55:51,120 --> 00:55:55,033
We'd have to tag every one of them.
We don't have the time.

490
00:55:55,240 --> 00:55:59,392
ln 19 hours the Enterprise will
be able to contact the Federation.

491
00:55:59,600 --> 00:56:04,071
- l'll order Riker to turn around.
- Picard's first officer.

492
00:56:04,280 --> 00:56:07,750
Do you really believe he'll listen?

493
00:56:07,960 --> 00:56:12,829
My ships
could intercept the Enterprise.

494
00:56:13,040 --> 00:56:16,077
l could send them to ...

495
00:56:16,280 --> 00:56:19,477
... escort it back.

496
00:56:19,680 --> 00:56:24,151
But Commander Riker
might not want to come.

497
00:56:26,720 --> 00:56:28,631
Send your ships.

498
00:56:50,800 --> 00:56:56,272
- Do you like being a machine?
- l aspire to be more than l am.

499
00:56:56,480 --> 00:57:03,670
l know why. So people like us
won't be afraid of you anymore.

500
00:57:03,880 --> 00:57:06,792
Don't you ever get tired?

501
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:11,039
My power cells
continually recharge themselves.

502
00:57:11,240 --> 00:57:16,109
l can't imagine
what it's like to be a machine.

503
00:57:16,320 --> 00:57:21,633
l have often tried to imagine
what it is like to be a child.

504
00:57:21,840 --> 00:57:25,879
Really?. For one thing, your legs
are shorter than everyone else's.

505
00:57:26,080 --> 00:57:29,516
But they are in
a constant state of growth.

506
00:57:29,720 --> 00:57:32,598
- ls it difficult to adapt?
- Adapt?

507
00:57:32,800 --> 00:57:37,396
A child's specifications change
from one moment to the next.

508
00:57:37,600 --> 00:57:42,754
- Do you trip over your own feet?
- Sometimes.

509
00:57:42,960 --> 00:57:47,476
My legs are exactly
87.2 cm in length.

510
00:57:47,680 --> 00:57:51,309
They were 87.2 cm
the day l was created.

511
00:57:51,520 --> 00:57:54,910
They will be 87.2 cm
the day l go off-line.

512
00:57:55,120 --> 00:57:58,590
l depend on specifications
that do not change.

513
00:57:58,800 --> 00:58:05,035
l will never experience growing up
or tripping over my own feet.

514
00:58:05,240 --> 00:58:11,634
But you've never had adults
telling you what to do all the time.

515
00:58:11,840 --> 00:58:18,871
l'd accept that in exchange for
knowing what childhood is like.

516
00:58:19,080 --> 00:58:22,959
- Do machines ever play?.
- l play the violin.

517
00:58:23,160 --> 00:58:28,314
- My chess is quite advanced.
- No, l mean play for fun.

518
00:58:29,840 --> 00:58:33,469
Androids do not have fun.

519
00:58:33,680 --> 00:58:39,038
lf you want to know what it's like
to be a child, learn to play.

520
00:58:51,080 --> 00:58:56,279
- Captain.
- Worf, you need a haircut.

521
00:58:56,480 --> 00:59:01,474
Rapid hair growth is experienced
by Klingons during Jaktahla.

522
00:59:01,680 --> 00:59:06,800
Puberty. Although for a Klingon
that scarcely does it justice.

523
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:12,154
Any mood swings or aggressive
tendencies, you let me know at once.

524
00:59:12,360 --> 00:59:15,591
Yes, sir.
The Ba'ku need some rest.

525
00:59:15,800 --> 00:59:19,952
According to the geo-scan,
this is a safe area.

526
00:59:20,160 --> 00:59:23,072
Very well, break out some rations.

527
00:59:27,160 --> 00:59:31,836
The caves are just over that ridge.
We can hide there.

528
00:59:32,040 --> 00:59:35,669
The Son'a will know that
as well as we do.

529
00:59:41,080 --> 00:59:45,392
lt's been 300 years
since l've seen a bald man.

530
00:59:48,200 --> 00:59:51,317
Why did you never marry?.

531
00:59:51,520 --> 00:59:55,149
Don't tell me it's because
you haven't got around to it yet.

532
00:59:55,360 --> 00:59:58,158
What's the rush?

533
00:59:58,360 --> 01:00:02,751
l should warn you, l've always
been attracted to older women.

534
01:00:24,920 --> 01:00:27,593
How are you doing this?

535
01:00:27,800 --> 01:00:30,519
No more questions.

536
01:00:44,480 --> 01:00:48,155
- Two Son'a ships approaching.
- ETA?

537
01:00:48,360 --> 01:00:51,750
- 18 minutes.
- We can't transmit for one hour.

538
01:00:51,960 --> 01:00:56,795
- They're hailing us.
- Tell them our receiver is down.

539
01:00:57,000 --> 01:01:00,709
- l don't think they believe us.
- Why not?

540
01:01:01,800 --> 01:01:06,555
Photon torpedo.
A universal method of communication.

541
01:01:06,760 --> 01:01:09,752
Yes, when you don't like someone.

542
01:01:09,960 --> 01:01:13,873
- Full impulse.
- The manifolds can't handle it.

543
01:01:14,080 --> 01:01:17,709
lf we don't outrun them,
it won't matter.

544
01:01:17,920 --> 01:01:21,595
- l'll be in engineering.
- Battle stations!

545
01:01:22,040 --> 01:01:25,953
Have your boobs started
to firm up?

546
01:01:26,160 --> 01:01:30,039
Not that we care about such things
in this day and age.

547
01:01:30,240 --> 01:01:33,312
Thank you, Data.

548
01:01:40,120 --> 01:01:44,511
l've an odd craving for the blood
of a live Kolar beast.

549
01:01:44,720 --> 01:01:47,871
This environment is affecting me.

550
01:01:48,080 --> 01:01:52,915
Have you noticed how your
boobs have started to firm up?

551
01:01:54,640 --> 01:01:57,234
Take cover!

552
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:45,198
lsolinear tags.
Transporters can lock onto them.

553
01:02:45,400 --> 01:02:48,949
There's a cavern at the base
of the next hill.

554
01:03:19,720 --> 01:03:23,190
- Shields at 60%.
- Engineering to bridge.

555
01:03:23,400 --> 01:03:28,713
We're going to blow ourselves up
without help from the Son'a!

556
01:03:28,920 --> 01:03:33,994
- What's inside that nebula cluster?.
- Cometary debris. Metreon gas.

557
01:03:34,200 --> 01:03:38,478
- We don't want go in there.
- Yes, we do.

558
01:03:38,680 --> 01:03:42,673
lt's time to use the Briar Patch
the way Brer Rabbit did.

559
01:03:57,080 --> 01:04:00,231
lnside the caves, quickly.

560
01:04:00,440 --> 01:04:02,032
This way.

561
01:04:13,360 --> 01:04:15,271
Aggressive tendencies.

562
01:04:19,520 --> 01:04:25,311
They've detonated an isolytic burst.
A subspace tear is forming.

563
01:04:26,720 --> 01:04:30,633
Subspace weapons were banned
by the Khitomer accord.

564
01:04:30,840 --> 01:04:35,391
- l'll lodge a protest.
- Our warp core is magnetised.

565
01:04:35,600 --> 01:04:39,354
We're pulling the tear
like a zipper across space.

566
01:04:39,560 --> 01:04:43,269
- We could eject the core.
- Will that stop the tear?.

567
01:04:43,480 --> 01:04:45,118
You got me.

568
01:04:45,320 --> 01:04:50,474
- ls that your expert opinion?
- lt might neutralise the cascade.

569
01:04:50,680 --> 01:04:54,559
Subspace weapons are unpredictable.
That's why they're banned.

570
01:04:54,760 --> 01:04:59,788
The tear is closing on us.
lmpact in 15 seconds.

571
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:01,991
Eject the core.

572
01:05:02,200 --> 01:05:06,352
- l just did.
- lmpact in ten seconds.

573
01:05:09,120 --> 01:05:11,395
Detonate!

574
01:05:24,120 --> 01:05:27,192
Get me a medic over here.

575
01:05:36,080 --> 01:05:39,436
lt worked. The tear is sealed.

576
01:05:39,640 --> 01:05:43,952
But there's nothing to stop them
from doing it again.

577
01:05:44,160 --> 01:05:48,631
- Transmission range: 36 minutes.
- We're through running.

578
01:06:07,640 --> 01:06:10,871
Another 43 reported taken.

579
01:06:20,200 --> 01:06:24,239
They're trying to drive us out
so their drones can tag us.

580
01:06:24,440 --> 01:06:28,718
The structural integrity of this
cavern won't hold for long.

581
01:06:28,920 --> 01:06:36,235
- ls there another way out of here?
- Let's track the water's course.

582
01:06:45,720 --> 01:06:50,191
l'm reading a nitrogen-oxygen flow
behind that calcite formation.

583
01:06:50,400 --> 01:06:53,995
Will this structure hold
if we blast through?

584
01:06:54,200 --> 01:06:57,829
l believe it is safe.

585
01:06:58,040 --> 01:07:00,998
Fire.

586
01:07:17,200 --> 01:07:22,638
Get everybody into those caves.
Set up a forcefield.

587
01:07:29,520 --> 01:07:35,117
- Are those pockets of metreon gas?
- Yes, highly volatile.

588
01:07:35,320 --> 01:07:39,438
l want to use the ram-scoop
to collect as much of it as we can.

589
01:07:39,640 --> 01:07:46,034
- The purpose being?
- To shove it down their throats.

590
01:07:46,240 --> 01:07:50,836
- lf the gas ignites ...
- lt's our only way out of here.

591
01:07:51,040 --> 01:07:54,919
History will remember this
as the Riker manoeuvre.

592
01:07:58,640 --> 01:08:01,518
Access manual steering column.

593
01:08:02,680 --> 01:08:07,834
- Controls to manual.
- Storage cells are atmaximum.

594
01:08:08,040 --> 01:08:10,918
They're powering forward weapons.

595
01:08:11,280 --> 01:08:14,078
Blow out the ram-scoop.

596
01:08:14,280 --> 01:08:17,431
Ram-scoop released.

597
01:08:32,680 --> 01:08:34,830
Captain.

598
01:08:35,040 --> 01:08:39,113
- Keep these people moving.
- Bring them out.

599
01:08:47,800 --> 01:08:51,031
lt won't be long before
the drones get here.

600
01:08:52,080 --> 01:08:55,038
Keep moving!

601
01:08:56,240 --> 01:09:01,109
There are caves on higher ground.
We'll be safe there.

602
01:09:05,360 --> 01:09:09,239
Take a look at this med-scan.

603
01:09:09,440 --> 01:09:12,955
His DNA profile.

604
01:09:13,160 --> 01:09:17,756
- How can that be possible?
- Maybe we should ask them.

605
01:09:30,040 --> 01:09:34,033
Artim, what are you doing? Come!

606
01:09:41,240 --> 01:09:47,190
ls this the last group?
Get them ready to move out.

607
01:09:47,400 --> 01:09:50,312
Anij went to find Artim.

608
01:10:12,680 --> 01:10:18,471
- Go with Tournel!
- No, l want to stay with you!

609
01:10:30,760 --> 01:10:34,833
- Worf to Picard!
- Two life-signs, one is faint.

610
01:10:35,040 --> 01:10:39,033
There are almost four metric tons
of rock blocking our way.

611
01:10:39,240 --> 01:10:43,074
That might cause another cave-in.

612
01:11:00,920 --> 01:11:03,878
Anij?

613
01:11:09,120 --> 01:11:12,954
- Worfto Picard.
- Yes, l can hear you.

614
01:11:13,160 --> 01:11:16,118
We're trying to get to you, sir.

615
01:11:16,840 --> 01:11:19,832
Anij ...

616
01:11:26,040 --> 01:11:29,316
Help is on the way.

617
01:11:29,520 --> 01:11:34,071
- Hurry, Anij is hurt.
- How bad is she?

618
01:11:36,640 --> 01:11:41,350
- l'm losing her.
- We're coming as fast as we can.

619
01:11:49,200 --> 01:11:53,557
Anij, stay with me.

620
01:11:56,400 --> 01:12:02,316
Help me find the power
to keep you in this moment.

621
01:12:03,440 --> 01:12:07,797
Don't let go of this moment.

622
01:12:23,080 --> 01:12:26,834
- She's stabilising.
- ls it safe to move her?.

623
01:12:27,040 --> 01:12:30,077
Safer than leaving her here.

624
01:12:33,640 --> 01:12:37,997
And you thought
it would take centuries to learn.

625
01:14:05,440 --> 01:14:09,558
Order them to surrender.
You won't be court-martialled.

626
01:14:09,760 --> 01:14:16,359
A court martial will let the people
know what is happening here.

627
01:14:16,560 --> 01:14:21,236
The Enterprise has destroyed
one ship, the other is on fire.

628
01:14:21,440 --> 01:14:26,195
The Enterprise was defending itself.
Ru'afo must have attacked.

629
01:14:26,400 --> 01:14:30,791
l can't believe that he didn't
have your consent, Admiral.

630
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:34,913
l wonder which one of us
will be facing that court martial.

631
01:14:35,760 --> 01:14:41,710
- There's nothing to be gained here.
- Right, this is going to end now.

632
01:14:41,920 --> 01:14:47,040
- l'm going to launch the injector.
- No, you're not.

633
01:14:47,240 --> 01:14:52,030
ln six hours, every living thing
in this system will be dead.

634
01:14:52,240 --> 01:14:55,471
You would kill your own people?

635
01:14:55,680 --> 01:15:00,390
Your own parents?
Brothers, sisters?

636
01:15:00,600 --> 01:15:06,072
Didn't you know?. The Son'a
and the Ba'ku are the same race.

637
01:15:08,720 --> 01:15:11,359
Picard just told us.

638
01:15:12,080 --> 01:15:15,550
Our DNA is identical.

639
01:15:16,400 --> 01:15:21,269
Which one were you?
Gal'na? Ro'tin?

640
01:15:21,480 --> 01:15:26,713
- They're gone forever.
- What's he talking about?

641
01:15:26,920 --> 01:15:31,550
A century ago, some young people
wanted to live like offlanders.

642
01:15:31,760 --> 01:15:37,278
- They tried to take over.
- And you exiled us to die slowly.

643
01:15:37,480 --> 01:15:40,711
You're Ro'tin, aren't you?

644
01:15:40,920 --> 01:15:44,196
There's something in the voice.

645
01:15:45,320 --> 01:15:48,710
Would you be his friend, Gal'na?

646
01:15:48,920 --> 01:15:54,631
l helped your mother bathe you.
She still speaks of you.

647
01:15:54,840 --> 01:15:58,469
You brought the Federation
into the middle of a blood feud.

648
01:15:58,680 --> 01:16:03,515
The children have returned
to expel their elders.

649
01:16:03,720 --> 01:16:08,635
Except Ru'afo's need for revenge
has escalated into parricide.

650
01:16:11,680 --> 01:16:15,150
lt was for the Federation.

651
01:16:15,360 --> 01:16:19,319
lt was all for the Federation.

652
01:16:30,240 --> 01:16:35,189
We're taking this ship out of here.
This mission is over.

653
01:16:35,400 --> 01:16:38,710
- lt is not over.
- lt is over.

654
01:16:44,520 --> 01:16:47,478
l do not take orders from you!

655
01:16:58,720 --> 01:17:04,750
lf you launch the injector,
the Federation will pursue you ...

656
01:17:04,960 --> 01:17:11,752
The Federation will never know
what happened here.

657
01:17:37,240 --> 01:17:41,074
Admiral Dougherty
won't be joining us.

658
01:17:41,280 --> 01:17:44,431
Deploy the collector.

659
01:17:46,680 --> 01:17:50,468
- Do you have a problem with that?
- May l talk to you alone?

660
01:17:50,680 --> 01:17:53,592
- Deploy the collector.
- Yes, sir.

661
01:17:57,360 --> 01:18:04,118
- You want to kill them all?
- No one hated them more than you.

662
01:18:04,320 --> 01:18:10,429
We've come a long way. This is the
moment we've planned for so long.

663
01:18:13,280 --> 01:18:17,432
Transfer all Starfleet personnel
to the cargo hold.

664
01:18:17,640 --> 01:18:20,871
See that Picard joins them.

665
01:18:21,080 --> 01:18:26,029
The shields in that section
won't protect them from the heat.

666
01:18:26,240 --> 01:18:29,198
Thank you for reminding me.

667
01:19:12,800 --> 01:19:15,030
Jean-Luc.

668
01:19:23,120 --> 01:19:26,476
Come with me.

669
01:19:40,600 --> 01:19:43,592
lt must have been strange for you
as a hostage, -

670
01:19:43,800 --> 01:19:47,998
- surrounded by all the friends
and family you once knew.

671
01:19:48,200 --> 01:19:51,237
All looking
exactly as they did then.

672
01:19:51,440 --> 01:19:56,070
Like looking through
the eyes of childhood again.

673
01:19:56,280 --> 01:20:00,671
And here you are,
closing those eyes.

674
01:20:00,880 --> 01:20:04,919
Trying not to see what bitterness
has done to the Son'a.

675
01:20:05,120 --> 01:20:09,432
How it's turned Ru'afo
into a madman. And you ...

676
01:20:09,640 --> 01:20:12,393
lt's turned you into a coward.

677
01:20:12,600 --> 01:20:16,718
A man who denies his own conscience.

678
01:20:16,920 --> 01:20:20,276
Get in.

679
01:20:24,080 --> 01:20:30,269
A coward without the moral courage
to prevent an atrocity.

680
01:20:30,480 --> 01:20:35,713
- Are you pleading for your life?
- l'm not pleading for my life.

681
01:20:37,920 --> 01:20:40,912
l'm pleading for yours.

682
01:20:41,120 --> 01:20:45,636
You can still go home, Gal'na.

683
01:20:54,480 --> 01:20:59,554
Computer, close turbolift doors.

684
01:21:00,400 --> 01:21:03,710
You're asking me
to do the impossible.

685
01:21:03,920 --> 01:21:08,072
- You can disable the injector.
- From the bridge.

686
01:21:08,280 --> 01:21:12,512
- The crew is loyal to Ru'afo.
- Perhaps we can lure him away.

687
01:21:12,720 --> 01:21:18,238
As soon as he realises something is
wrong, he'll override my commands.

688
01:21:18,440 --> 01:21:24,754
He may not realise something
is wrong. Get me to a transmitter.

689
01:21:24,960 --> 01:21:29,238
l need to speak with Data and Worf
down on the planet.

690
01:21:34,680 --> 01:21:37,035
lnitiate separation.

691
01:21:37,240 --> 01:21:40,471
Separation in three minutes.

692
01:21:40,680 --> 01:21:45,037
A small craft is approaching.
lt's powering up its weapons.

693
01:21:45,240 --> 01:21:49,552
- On screen.
- One person aboard, the android.

694
01:21:49,760 --> 01:21:52,228
He's no threat.

695
01:21:56,720 --> 01:22:00,474
Data to Picard.
They're ignoring my attack.

696
01:22:00,680 --> 01:22:04,275
Keep firing into the shield.
ls Worf in position?

697
01:22:04,480 --> 01:22:09,076
- Yes, he's ready for transport.
- We're approaching the bridge.

698
01:22:13,560 --> 01:22:17,872
- Separation in one minute.
- He's disrupting our shields.

699
01:22:18,080 --> 01:22:22,551
lf they go out of phase,
we'll be exposed to the reaction.

700
01:22:22,920 --> 01:22:29,155
Very well, destroy that ship.
Do not delay the countdown.

701
01:22:34,920 --> 01:22:38,708
Data to Picard. They are
rotating their shield harmonics.

702
01:22:38,920 --> 01:22:42,037
l am attempting
to return to the surface.

703
01:22:42,240 --> 01:22:46,597
- The Federation ship has been hit.
- Separation in 20 seconds.

704
01:22:48,160 --> 01:22:50,799
- What's that?
- l don't know.

705
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:55,676
- The systems don't seem affected.
- Separation in ten seconds.

706
01:22:57,920 --> 01:23:00,957
Five seconds.

707
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:05,356
The injector assembly has separated.

708
01:23:21,840 --> 01:23:25,913
Exactly
as the simulations predicted.

709
01:23:29,280 --> 01:23:32,989
l'm not showing any change
in metaphasic flux levels.

710
01:23:33,200 --> 01:23:39,753
- Your scanners are malfunctioning.
- All ship functions are off-line.

711
01:23:39,960 --> 01:23:44,078
How can there be no ship functions
if the view screen is working?

712
01:23:44,280 --> 01:23:48,717
Artificial gravity is stable.
Life support is ...

713
01:24:00,440 --> 01:24:03,796
A holodeck!

714
01:24:31,160 --> 01:24:36,598
We were transported to the holoship
when we reset our shields.

715
01:24:36,800 --> 01:24:42,352
Everything we saw was an illusion.
Ru'afo, authorisation Delta 2-1 .

716
01:24:42,560 --> 01:24:45,632
Override all commands
to injector assembly one.

717
01:24:45,840 --> 01:24:51,039
Unable to comply. lnjector
assembly one has been deactivated.

718
01:24:59,280 --> 01:25:03,956
All injector sub-systems
aboard the collector are off-line.

719
01:25:04,160 --> 01:25:08,790
De-cloak the holoship
and engage a tractor beam.

720
01:25:15,880 --> 01:25:21,238
The crew know something is wrong.
l've secured the bridge.

721
01:25:23,960 --> 01:25:28,670
We have 14 long-range transporters.
Are they all useless?

722
01:25:28,880 --> 01:25:32,759
They were locked
after we were beamed here.

723
01:25:32,960 --> 01:25:36,839
lsolate one and re-route it
through the auxiliary processor.

724
01:25:37,040 --> 01:25:41,113
There's nothing we can do.
They have control of our ship.

725
01:25:41,320 --> 01:25:43,595
l'm not going back to our ship.

726
01:25:46,160 --> 01:25:49,232
- Worf, destroy that thing.
- Aye, sir.

727
01:25:50,720 --> 01:25:55,953
- Weapons systems are off-line.
- They're re-routing controls.

728
01:25:57,760 --> 01:26:03,073
The collector launch sequence
has resumed.

729
01:26:03,600 --> 01:26:07,229
Collector shields have been raised.
Someone's on board.

730
01:26:07,680 --> 01:26:10,797
- lt's Ru'afo.
- Can you override the launch?

731
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:17,872
Not without access codes. There
is self-destruct on the collector.

732
01:26:18,080 --> 01:26:24,474
- Try to beam through those shields.
- lt has to be detonated manually.

733
01:26:24,680 --> 01:26:28,912
Transport is possible between the
shield generators within 100 metres.

734
01:26:29,120 --> 01:26:33,033
Take us into position.
Remain at your post.

735
01:26:33,240 --> 01:26:37,756
- l need you to beam me back.
- We're approaching the collector.

736
01:26:37,960 --> 01:26:43,318
When the fuel tanks start venting,
weapons fire may ignite the exhaust.

737
01:26:51,840 --> 01:26:55,753
Separation
in 2 minutes and 15 seconds.

738
01:27:04,680 --> 01:27:07,240
lntruder alert.

739
01:27:40,480 --> 01:27:42,436
Captain!

740
01:27:42,640 --> 01:27:44,915
Worf?

741
01:27:51,240 --> 01:27:54,789
Captain Picard
is on board the collector.

742
01:27:55,000 --> 01:27:59,790
Enterprise to Picard!
Do you need assistance?

743
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:05,231
- l may need a lift in a minute.
- We're on our way.

744
01:28:05,440 --> 01:28:08,876
Separation in one minute.

745
01:28:34,160 --> 01:28:36,754
- Report.
- lt's Ru'afo's ship!

746
01:28:36,960 --> 01:28:39,269
On screen.

747
01:28:39,480 --> 01:28:44,998
Sensors are reading over 100 Ba'ku
on board and one Klingon.

748
01:28:45,200 --> 01:28:50,069
Target their ventral engines and
life support. Collision course.

749
01:28:52,800 --> 01:28:55,155
Stop!

750
01:28:58,360 --> 01:29:04,356
- We're getting too old for this.
- Soon that won't be a problem.

751
01:29:04,560 --> 01:29:06,869
Separation in 30 seconds.

752
01:29:07,080 --> 01:29:10,789
You're really going to risk
igniting the exhaust?

753
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:13,798
All right, l will!

754
01:29:22,840 --> 01:29:26,594
- Shields at 60%.
- Hold your course.

755
01:29:28,440 --> 01:29:31,750
- He wouldn't.
- Yes, he would.

756
01:29:33,720 --> 01:29:35,631
Now!

757
01:29:46,080 --> 01:29:49,072
Stand by, Captain. We're on our way.

758
01:29:49,280 --> 01:29:52,590
Sorry, time's up.

759
01:30:27,720 --> 01:30:30,871
What kept you, Number One?

760
01:30:31,080 --> 01:30:35,676
The Federation Council
has halted the Ba'ku relocation.

761
01:30:35,880 --> 01:30:38,713
There'll be a top-level review.

762
01:30:38,920 --> 01:30:42,230
- Ru'afo's ship is hailing us.
- On screen.

763
01:30:42,800 --> 01:30:49,672
The Son'a crew want a cease-fire.
We have three minutes of air left.

764
01:30:49,880 --> 01:30:52,440
Prepare to beam aboard.

765
01:30:59,040 --> 01:31:03,750
How will we feel when we leave
this metaphasic radiation?

766
01:31:03,960 --> 01:31:07,589
Your feelings about her
haven't changed.

767
01:31:07,800 --> 01:31:11,793
This place just let them out
for a little fresh air.

768
01:31:14,080 --> 01:31:18,312
- How can we bring them back home?
- Ask them.

769
01:31:18,520 --> 01:31:23,640
l'm afraid there's too much
bitterness on both sides.

770
01:31:27,280 --> 01:31:30,431
Mother and son.

771
01:31:30,640 --> 01:31:34,349
- You arranged this?
- To begin the healing process.

772
01:31:44,320 --> 01:31:47,995
What am l going to do without you?

773
01:31:48,200 --> 01:31:51,192
l wish l could stay ...

774
01:31:51,400 --> 01:31:55,712
But these are perilous times
for the Federation.

775
01:31:55,920 --> 01:31:59,833
l can't abandon it to people
who would threaten -

776
01:32:00,040 --> 01:32:04,352
- everything l've spent a lifetime
defending. l have to go back ...

777
01:32:04,560 --> 01:32:10,271
lf only to slow things down
at the Federation Council.

778
01:32:12,160 --> 01:32:17,188
l have 318 days of shore leave
coming, and ...

779
01:32:20,040 --> 01:32:22,270
... l intend to use them.

780
01:32:32,280 --> 01:32:34,236
Data?

781
01:32:34,440 --> 01:32:37,159
lt's time to go.

782
01:32:37,360 --> 01:32:40,397
l have to go home now.

783
01:32:40,600 --> 01:32:43,398
- Bye.
- Bye.

784
01:32:56,600 --> 01:33:00,229
Mr Data,
l hope we'll see you again.

785
01:33:06,360 --> 01:33:12,708
Data! Don't forget, you have
to have a little fun every day.

786
01:33:13,360 --> 01:33:16,432
Good advice.

787
01:33:26,640 --> 01:33:31,475
Picard to Enterprise.
Seven to beam up.

788
01:33:35,280 --> 01:33:37,589
Energize.
