Revision based on Prutswerk ver. 1

3
00:00:11,822 --> 00:00:16,031
Thank you for your efforts
Please enjoy!

00:00:21,831 --> 00:00:27,631
"His tail swept a third of the stars out of
the sky and flung them to the earth.

5
00:00:27,732 --> 00:00:33,332
The dragon stood in front of the woman
who was about to give birth

6
00:00:33,433 --> 00:00:37,533
so that he might devour her child
the moment it was born." -- Revelation 12:4

7
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:59,290
Just as we anticipated

8
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:22,170
Hey, let me through

9
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:38,640
I hope the stun rounds didn't injure her

10
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:44,720
Captain, Deunan has been secured

11
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:54,360
She's beautiful...

12
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:46,460
8 hours and 12 minutes, she's sleeping well

13
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:51,730
The legendary soldier is so cute when she's sleeping

14
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:56,560
About your body, will you...?

15
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,670
She will be surprised

16
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,860
when we get to Utopia

17
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,630
Utopia, huh...

18
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:13,350
Olympus A5, do we have permission to land?

19
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:18,210
Don't get too close before ID is confirmed

20
00:09:18,411 --> 00:09:21,020
or the Fortress cannon will fire

21
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:23,290
Olympus A5, come in

22
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:26,230
Permission confirmed

23
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:30,290
ESWAT109 preparing for descent

24
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:18,070
Briareos

25
00:11:18,530 --> 00:11:20,330
I'm going out for a look

26
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:21,310
I'll go with ya

27
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:23,310
No, you stay here

28
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:27,460
Don't worry... I'll be back in a sec

29
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:31,480
Briareos

30
00:12:04,450 --> 00:12:07,040
Gosh, a detailed inspection?

31
00:12:07,430 --> 00:12:09,240
It was ordered by the Legislative Council

32
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:11,970
Still sleeping...?

33
00:12:12,671 --> 00:12:15,110
Could we have given the wrong dosage?

34
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:31,470
Don't move or I'll break your neck!

35
00:12:49,450 --> 00:12:51,150
Deunan Knute, 2nd Team Leader

36
00:12:51,351 --> 00:12:52,650
You are ordered to stand down

37
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:54,460
Briareos

38
00:13:18,170 --> 00:13:19,200
I can't believe it!

39
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:22,070
I know it's hard to believe

40
00:13:22,071 --> 00:13:23,840
but it's the truth

41
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:27,370
So after all this war

42
00:13:27,471 --> 00:13:29,840
nobody won in the end?

43
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:30,933
That's right

44
00:13:30,934 --> 00:13:33,735
After the Great War, Earth became unified

45
00:13:33,736 --> 00:13:37,470
and central administration "Olympus" took over

46
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:41,500
That means I blindly kept fighting for months

47
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:43,770
and it was all for nothing?

48
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,700
That's how war is, right?

49
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:48,690
But it's different here

50
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:53,530
Olympus is the realization of the perfect Utopia

51
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:56,500
Why did you bring me here?

52
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:59,770
Because you are an elite soldier

53
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:04,720
Your name was top on the ESWAT list

54
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:09,328
My mission is to bring people on the list

55
00:14:09,329 --> 00:14:11,680
from the badlands to Olympus

56
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:13,610
ESWAT?

57
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:16,140
I know you must have lots of questions

58
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:18,500
but please take a rest tonight

59
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:21,550
We'll continue tomorrow

60
00:14:21,651 --> 00:14:23,600
I'll show you around the city

61
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:26,700
I'm sure, Deunan, you'll fall in love

62
00:14:26,801 --> 00:14:27,700
with our Utopia

63
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:33,470
Here is your bedroom

64
00:14:34,610 --> 00:14:36,710
I bet you haven't slept on a soft bed for ages

65
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,500
I'll pick you up at 10 am tomorrow

66
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:42,980
You're Hitomi... right?

67
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:45,310
That's right

68
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:47,890
Have we met before?

69
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:50,715
I'm afraid not

70
00:14:50,716 --> 00:14:51,930
Well, good night!

71
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:06,700
When did you...

72
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:10,120
In the battle of North Africa

73
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:12,070
I lost my body

74
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:14,320
It's been over one year

75
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:26,340
This was Carl's...

76
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:30,150
Your father left it for you

77
00:15:30,790 --> 00:15:32,480
Don't let anyone take it

78
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:42,400
Call me if you have trouble

79
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:44,570
Briareos

80
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:47,815
Out there yesterday...

81
00:15:47,816 --> 00:15:49,230
Do you know who attacked me?

82
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:52,170
No

83
00:17:08,270 --> 00:17:09,830
What a pity...

84
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:16,210
Athena, you arranged that attack, didn't you?

85
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:23,090
You should know that mercenaries couldn't
possibly compete with the ESWAT

86
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:27,800
Have you forgotten the mission of Bioroids?

87
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:29,700
If the military found out

88
00:17:30,470 --> 00:17:32,970
General Uranus would surely retaliate

89
00:17:33,930 --> 00:17:37,300
We won't be able to control them by ourselves

90
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:41,600
Gaia may be reaching her limit

91
00:17:41,830 --> 00:17:46,600
Athena, we don't have much time left

92
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:57,730
Nike

93
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,220
They've found out

94
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:07,560
My apologies, Ma'am

95
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:10,870
Nike

96
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:13,150
We need our man inside ESWAT

97
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:15,250
I'll make preparations right away

98
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:18,080
But the worst of it is

99
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:23,340
we didn't find what we were looking for

100
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:25,020
That means...

101
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:29,490
It's not time to use our last resort

102
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:35,230
But the fire has to be put out before it spreads

103
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:39,500
Secure Deunan Knute by whatever means!

104
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:40,540
Yes Ma'am!

105
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:52,860
Humans are such strange creatures

106
00:18:52,861 --> 00:18:54,290
falling into their own traps

107
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:23,870
I never expected a personal visit from Captain Hades

108
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:28,920
ESWAT is still head over heels searching
for that dummy information

109
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:35,900
We have now completed 98% of preparations

110
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:41,830
Perfect

111
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:47,775
The problem with the special part on the leg

112
00:19:47,776 --> 00:19:50,390
has also been fixed

113
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:55,280
General Uranus will be pleased

114
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:02,830
And soon...

115
00:20:02,831 --> 00:20:05,690
The Bioroids will no longer be!

116
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:12,380
We should not be protecting wolves

117
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:15,730
Rather, we should protect the sheep

118
00:20:15,930 --> 00:20:18,115
Indeed, that's the principle

119
00:20:18,116 --> 00:20:20,300
of our 1st generation Bioroids

120
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:25,950
However, some humans are wolves in sheep-skin

121
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,810
No matter wolf or sheep

122
00:20:28,811 --> 00:20:31,620
there should be no sacrifices

123
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:34,065
What a pity

124
00:20:34,366 --> 00:20:37,830
We've always known the answer to this

125
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:43,120
Yet we still have to debate with Gaia

126
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:47,850
Then let us continue our debate with Gaia

127
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:13,310
Deunan!

128
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:21,180
Briareos!

129
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:58,520
Morning, Deunan!

130
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:14,280
It fits you well

131
00:22:14,281 --> 00:22:15,170
C'mon

132
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:27,110
Your entry permit was approved this morning

133
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:30,700
So Deunan, you're now a citizen of Olympus

134
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,400
Beautiful, isn't it?

135
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:39,460
Compared to yesterday

136
00:22:40,270 --> 00:22:41,840
this is like a dream

137
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:43,980
From today this is your reality

138
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:45,660
Everyone looks so happy

139
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:48,540
That's because 50% of the population

140
00:22:48,541 --> 00:22:49,660
are Bioroids

141
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:50,880
Bioroids?

142
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:52,640
Artificially created humans

143
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:53,760
A clone?

144
00:22:54,090 --> 00:22:55,260
No, not that simple...

145
00:22:55,510 --> 00:22:57,375
Superior lifeforms created from

146
00:22:57,376 --> 00:22:59,240
highly selective genetic breeding

147
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:03,160
Does that mean this city is controlled by clones?

148
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:05,500
You know, it's not polite to say "clone"

149
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:08,320
I'm a Bioroid myself

150
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:12,160
And despite being superior

151
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:14,860
Bioroids do not control humans

152
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:18,210
Bioroids coexist peacefully with humans

153
00:23:18,460 --> 00:23:21,240
and stabilizes the human society

154
00:23:22,830 --> 00:23:24,930
Half of them are Bioroids...?

155
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:34,510
This car feels weird

156
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:37,940
It's been installed with the Damysos System

157
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:39,180
Damysos?

158
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,480
Yes, it's like hovering

159
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:43,770
They say it can prolong the driver's life

160
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,690
So they've actually completed that technology?

161
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:49,840
But you still control with a steering wheel?

162
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,605
Because of advanced cybernetic technology

163
00:23:52,706 --> 00:23:54,810
this car is driven by automation

164
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:58,420
But the wheel is "for the people"

165
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:02,960
"Functional simplicity, structural complexity

166
00:24:02,961 --> 00:24:04,640
... make humans more human"

167
00:24:04,741 --> 00:24:05,890
How's that?

168
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:07,730
What was that?

169
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:10,210
"People first." That's the basic philosophy

170
00:24:10,221 --> 00:24:11,660
of the original architects

171
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:13,622
The city's landmarks are the Arcologies

172
00:24:13,623 --> 00:24:14,230
There

173
00:24:16,470 --> 00:24:17,990
Tartarus and Daedalus

174
00:24:18,570 --> 00:24:20,845
They contain the I.N. that controls Olympus

175
00:24:20,846 --> 00:24:23,120
central control, the "brain" of the city

176
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:24,770
I.N.?

177
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:27,110
"Intelligence Network" system

178
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,090
also called Gaia

179
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:33,810
Gaia grows with the network,
and monitors everything in Olympus

180
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:37,610
... especially us Bioroids

181
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:39,000
Why's that?

182
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:41,970
Well, humans have emotions

183
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:43,830
they argue

184
00:24:44,031 --> 00:24:45,160
they fight

185
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:48,680
Bioroids have limited emotions

186
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:50,247
we do not hate

187
00:24:50,248 --> 00:24:52,599
we're always in a state of equilibrium

188
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:54,950
so we'll never start a war

189
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:57,545
But at the top of Tartarus

190
00:24:57,646 --> 00:24:59,690
is an impenetrable defense system

191
00:24:59,791 --> 00:25:02,480
sealing "D-Tank" which stores a special virus

192
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:04,965
They say if the virus was ever released

193
00:25:05,066 --> 00:25:07,330
all Bioroids would die

194
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:09,990
That's the result of human defensive instinct

195
00:25:10,210 --> 00:25:11,770
It sure insults Bioroids though

196
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:14,760
You're suggesting humans are more dangerous?

197
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:17,700
That's why balance is so important

198
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:22,850
Gaia monitors the effect of Bioroids on humans

199
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:25,750
But it's actually humans who are being monitored

200
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,970
You sound just like General Uranus

201
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:28,800
Who's he?

202
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:31,370
Commander of the Olympus Military

203
00:25:32,260 --> 00:25:34,225
an extremist who hates Bioroids

204
00:25:34,326 --> 00:25:36,190
and who is quite vocal about it

205
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:38,800
Wow, an "unbalanced being" in Utopia

206
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:40,785
But for the most part

207
00:25:40,786 --> 00:25:42,470
Bioroids run Olympus

208
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:45,190
Administrative Director Athena is a Bioroid too

209
00:25:45,570 --> 00:25:46,685
Athena?

210
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:50,580
You know her?

211
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:53,820
I don't think so

212
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:58,080
The Administrative Director is like a President

213
00:25:58,700 --> 00:26:00,900
However the military is controlled by humans

214
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:02,100
Scary, huh?

215
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:08,135
Recently, ESWAT under Athena has been expanding

216
00:26:08,236 --> 00:26:10,370
Relations with the military has been bad

217
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,130
Now it's gone from bad to worse

218
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:16,780
But all decisions in Olympus

219
00:26:16,781 --> 00:26:19,260
are controlled by Gaia

220
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:21,380
Something wrong?

221
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:22,710
We've got company

222
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:19,040
Hitomi, you OK?

223
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:20,230
Yes somehow

224
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:21,570
But what was that

225
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:30,250
They're pros obviously

226
00:27:30,820 --> 00:27:32,730
Seems like I'm their target

227
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:33,760
So it seems

228
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,790
I guess THIS is still my reality

229
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:18,250
Briareos!

230
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:40,370
< we cannot unseal the Appleseed >

231
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:07,750
Hi grandpas! How is everyone?

232
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:10,820
Hitomi, did you get hurt?

233
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:12,960
Are you alright?

234
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:15,440
I'm OK!

235
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,040
Guess who I brought along?

236
00:30:18,041 --> 00:30:19,400
It's Deunan Knute!

237
00:30:23,781 --> 00:30:26,420
So here is the legendary beauty!

238
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:28,140
Goddess of Fighting

239
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:31,220
You have Carl's eyes

240
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:33,220
You know my father?

241
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:35,500
Not only that

242
00:30:35,740 --> 00:30:37,610
most of the Bioroids in Olympus

243
00:30:37,611 --> 00:30:39,680
have some of Carl's DNA

244
00:30:39,781 --> 00:30:41,350
as his genetic material was used

245
00:30:41,351 --> 00:30:42,920
for the 1st generation models

246
00:30:43,100 --> 00:30:47,600
Which means Hitomi and Deunan are sisters

247
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:49,813
We heard you met some

248
00:30:49,914 --> 00:30:50,485
um...

249
00:30:50,886 --> 00:30:52,770
not-so-pleasant things

250
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:55,945
Recently, it's been increasingly complicated

251
00:30:56,046 --> 00:30:58,890
to control the people outside

252
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:02,170
We worry that the balance will be broken

253
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:07,630
First, let us introduce you to Gaia

254
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:31,140
How are my pesky colleagues?

255
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:33,900
The Legislative and Administrative Councils
have begun confronting each other

256
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:37,330
on issues such as increasing Bioroid population

257
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:41,650
It's Carl's daughter that Athena wants, right?

258
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:42,735
Positive, sir

259
00:31:44,536 --> 00:31:46,470
Everything has been prepared as ordered

260
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:48,660
What level is the informative source?

261
00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:50,540
Level 5, sir

262
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:52,860
General

263
00:31:53,061 --> 00:31:54,540
We await your orders

264
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:01,646
Human souls will no longer serve as tools

265
00:32:01,747 --> 00:32:03,410
for their existence!

266
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,540
So this is Gaia

267
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:25,095
Gaia is a growing network

268
00:32:25,396 --> 00:32:28,190
which controls Olympus

269
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:31,572
Gaia consults with the Seven Elders

270
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:34,080
and her decision becomes the will of Olympus

271
00:32:34,700 --> 00:32:37,780
Gaia is the brainchild of many scientists

272
00:32:37,781 --> 00:32:40,860
who had poured their spirits into its creation

273
00:32:41,300 --> 00:32:43,890
However a machine is a machine

274
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,820
Built for absolute stability

275
00:32:46,150 --> 00:32:48,110
A highly precise, reliable tool

276
00:32:48,380 --> 00:32:50,575
With no emotions, no feelings

277
00:32:50,676 --> 00:32:52,870
Absolutely impartial and takes no sides

278
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:55,440
Only by interacting

279
00:32:55,541 --> 00:32:57,880
with the Seven Elder's feelings

280
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:02,130
could Gaia think more like a human

281
00:33:02,900 --> 00:33:05,950
Though lately you seem to differ with Gaia a lot

282
00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:12,070
Our work is to debate with Gaia

283
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:16,775
The conclusion of the argument

284
00:33:16,776 --> 00:33:20,550
will then lead Olympus in the right direction

285
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:25,580
Deunan, when you were in the war

286
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:29,140
what did you fight for?

287
00:33:31,730 --> 00:33:32,700
Well

288
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:36,545
Human beings will not stop fighting

289
00:33:36,646 --> 00:33:39,490
as long as there are emotions and desires

290
00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:43,830
That's why Olympus was created

291
00:33:44,900 --> 00:33:48,105
The last hope for human beings

292
00:33:48,106 --> 00:33:51,310
is the coexistence of humans and Bioroids

293
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:56,260
Gaia monitors the balance

294
00:33:57,200 --> 00:34:01,000
Bioroids are totally different from humans

295
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:03,920
Without the ability to procreate

296
00:34:04,021 --> 00:34:06,140
they can have no offspring

297
00:34:06,900 --> 00:34:08,180
No sex, imagine!

298
00:34:08,900 --> 00:34:12,397
So they do not have love

299
00:34:12,498 --> 00:34:14,544
and with it, no desire

300
00:34:14,645 --> 00:34:16,890
nor hate

301
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:20,895
However, if their life-extension process

302
00:34:20,996 --> 00:34:23,590
is not carried out regularly

303
00:34:23,700 --> 00:34:29,120
they will age very swiftly and die

304
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:33,975
We wanted Bioroids to be different from humans

305
00:34:33,976 --> 00:34:37,750
so we suppressed their reproductive ability

306
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:41,160
shortened their life cycle

307
00:34:41,700 --> 00:34:42,445
Hitomi

308
00:34:42,846 --> 00:34:46,990
Aren't you late for your life-extension?

309
00:34:47,900 --> 00:34:51,500
No problem, I'm going there in two days

310
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:53,242
We wish someday

311
00:34:53,243 --> 00:34:57,270
there would be a less troublesome way for you

312
00:35:57,100 --> 00:35:58,365
Kudo

313
00:35:58,366 --> 00:36:00,660
Your team are all dead

314
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:10,070
Still Fresh, aren't you?

315
00:36:10,171 --> 00:36:11,140
Better luck next time

316
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:19,395
Starting with only 1 knife

317
00:36:19,396 --> 00:36:21,590
she killed 16 men in 10 minutes

318
00:36:22,700 --> 00:36:24,890
Your rookie sure is something!

319
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:35,240
Did that feel good?

320
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,485
You shouldn't say things like that

321
00:36:40,586 --> 00:36:42,770
They might have to save your life someday

322
00:36:43,260 --> 00:36:44,480
Act like a smartass

323
00:36:44,581 --> 00:36:45,900
and no one will take care of you

324
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:54,285
We haven't seen each other for so long

325
00:36:54,386 --> 00:36:55,970
and that's all you can say?

326
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:10,240
Hey, can't you say something nice?

327
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:13,400
Like "how've you been?"

328
00:37:14,100 --> 00:37:15,540
"nice to see you again"

329
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:17,570
Someone has an interest in you

330
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:19,315
I heard that already

331
00:37:19,416 --> 00:37:20,623
But why would they?

332
00:37:20,724 --> 00:37:22,030
Who are they anyway?

333
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:23,560
I don't know

334
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:25,480
And what's this "Appleseed"?

335
00:37:25,900 --> 00:37:26,800
I don't know

336
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,220
Stop giving me such mechanical answers!

337
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:35,570
I'm sorry

338
00:37:45,510 --> 00:37:48,060
Right now, my mission is to protect you

339
00:37:50,300 --> 00:37:51,330
Mission...

340
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:54,300
Tomorrow we meet at 0900 hours

341
00:38:37,340 --> 00:38:39,842
Well, if it ain't the legendary soldier

342
00:38:39,843 --> 00:38:42,310
the great Deunan

343
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:45,210
They said you died during the Great War

344
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:49,460
Your exploits in the war of North Africa was legendary

345
00:38:55,130 --> 00:38:56,690
May I sit here?

346
00:38:58,530 --> 00:38:59,300
Go ahead

347
00:39:01,700 --> 00:39:02,527
Deunan

348
00:39:03,128 --> 00:39:04,369
Carl Knute, your father

349
00:39:05,270 --> 00:39:07,410
Can you tell me about him?

350
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:09,790
He died before the Great War

351
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:10,800
Sorry

352
00:39:12,220 --> 00:39:13,080
Your mother?

353
00:39:13,300 --> 00:39:15,130
I can't remember anything about her

354
00:39:15,700 --> 00:39:17,840
My father didn't tell me anything either

355
00:39:22,700 --> 00:39:26,360
Deunan and Briareos were lovers, right?

356
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:29,195
Yeah, when he was human

357
00:39:29,296 --> 00:39:30,590
though not sure about now

358
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:33,110
So the body is more important than love

359
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:35,340
That's not what I meant!

360
00:39:35,850 --> 00:39:39,200
For a man, the body represents sex

361
00:39:43,330 --> 00:39:44,205
By the way

362
00:39:46,706 --> 00:39:48,980
How does it feel to be in love?

363
00:39:50,300 --> 00:39:53,950
You know, Bioroid's emotions are restrained

364
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:56,670
I don't know what love is

365
00:39:57,900 --> 00:39:59,940
I can learn and read about it

366
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:01,175
But

367
00:40:01,276 --> 00:40:03,500
I can never feel it

368
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:08,610
So I become more curious

369
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:14,410
I envy humans at this point

370
00:40:18,900 --> 00:40:21,230
A woman in love, what is that like?

371
00:40:23,890 --> 00:40:25,490
The feeling of loving someone

372
00:40:29,570 --> 00:40:30,990
You asshole!

373
00:40:31,091 --> 00:40:32,618
You're only a Bioroid!

374
00:40:32,719 --> 00:40:34,410
How dare you get in my way!

375
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:37,685
Olympus Military

376
00:40:37,886 --> 00:40:39,170
They are so stupid

377
00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:41,410
Always making a scene

378
00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:34,535
Synchro-test completed

379
00:41:34,536 --> 00:41:36,370
No problems found

380
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:39,780
Now you only need to adjust the safety belt

381
00:41:40,300 --> 00:41:42,530
Before I do, can you clarify for me again

382
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:46,010
Why the reduction in shock-absorption material?

383
00:41:46,300 --> 00:41:47,255
I already told you

384
00:41:47,256 --> 00:41:48,810
it's the dynamic structure

385
00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:51,720
that itself absorbs most of the shock

386
00:41:52,100 --> 00:41:54,960
But the cartilage has many structures

387
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,370
Joints, bearings, depressor mechanisms

388
00:41:57,471 --> 00:42:00,540
are self-restrained, soft-shelled units

389
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:04,190
and will dislocate under too much stress

390
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:05,290
Yoshitsune-kun

391
00:42:05,291 --> 00:42:07,960
This is Deunan Knute, you needn't worry

392
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,795
But I've never a seen a woman

393
00:42:11,096 --> 00:42:12,390
who can operate a Land Mate

394
00:42:13,100 --> 00:42:14,365
OK, let me try

395
00:42:14,466 --> 00:42:15,830
Help me adjust the belt

396
00:42:28,700 --> 00:42:29,675
Deunan

397
00:42:29,776 --> 00:42:33,000
Yoshitsune is the best mechanic in Olympus

398
00:42:33,300 --> 00:42:35,200
When it comes to Land Mates

399
00:42:35,700 --> 00:42:38,350
You should look into Hecatonchires next

400
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,990
Next time, please let me see your inner structure

401
00:42:41,500 --> 00:42:43,005
You better just forget it

402
00:42:43,206 --> 00:42:44,710
I'm blushing already

403
00:42:56,500 --> 00:42:57,450
All secured?

404
00:42:57,490 --> 00:42:58,810
Yep, no problem

405
00:42:58,850 --> 00:43:01,970
OK, this is the ignition switch

406
00:43:09,300 --> 00:43:10,897
First you need to practice

407
00:43:10,898 --> 00:43:11,530
easy does it

408
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:13,220
That's the way

409
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:33,460
What is it?

410
00:43:33,500 --> 00:43:34,840
The emergency launch alarm!

411
00:43:40,700 --> 00:43:41,972
Unidentified Land Mates

412
00:43:42,073 --> 00:43:45,130
are invading Gaia Research Center!

413
00:43:45,300 --> 00:43:47,010
ESWAT launch immediately!

414
00:44:01,600 --> 00:44:02,675
What are you waiting for?

415
00:44:02,876 --> 00:44:03,750
Move it!

416
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:06,250
That's fine. I'm moving out now

417
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:07,720
Like that?!

418
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:11,540
Deunan!

419
00:45:07,700 --> 00:45:08,410
Stop!

420
00:45:19,500 --> 00:45:20,160
Here they come

421
00:45:46,680 --> 00:45:47,630
Now target

422
00:46:01,100 --> 00:46:01,870
Deunan

423
00:46:18,300 --> 00:46:19,510
Wait! Don't come this way!

424
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:36,940
Drop your weapon!

425
00:47:04,841 --> 00:47:05,641
Deunan!

426
00:47:33,400 --> 00:47:34,400
Briareos

427
00:47:48,780 --> 00:47:49,470
Sorry

428
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:17,940
What mindless waste

429
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:20,610
3rd generation Bioroids have all been destroyed

430
00:48:21,800 --> 00:48:23,660
DNA systems for the life-extension

431
00:48:23,761 --> 00:48:25,520
have also been destroyed

432
00:48:26,100 --> 00:48:29,310
They entered via the underground elevator shaft

433
00:48:29,700 --> 00:48:32,690
They broke through all 7 levels of Security System

434
00:48:33,900 --> 00:48:36,490
No sign they were from outside Olympus

435
00:48:36,980 --> 00:48:39,830
We don't know who those Land Mates belonged to

436
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:41,780
This is just too much!

437
00:48:43,300 --> 00:48:48,160
We can only accept human reality
and take on their burden

438
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:51,400
We have no alternatives left

439
00:48:53,500 --> 00:48:57,050
As of now, seal the entire perimeter
of Tartarus and Daedalus!

440
00:48:57,900 --> 00:49:01,120
No one is permitted to access D-tank

441
00:49:01,160 --> 00:49:01,790
Yes, Ma'am

442
00:49:02,200 --> 00:49:04,220
Call for an emergency meeting immediately!
