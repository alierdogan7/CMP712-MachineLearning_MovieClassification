1
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:53,130
The arrow which
felled the boar...

2
00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:57,170
belonged to Lord Ichimonji.

3
00:02:57,670 --> 00:02:59,970
Drink to him!

4
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:12,850
The wily old beast...

5
00:03:12,890 --> 00:03:15,790
shot out right
in front of me.

6
00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:18,120
My horse reared...

7
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:21,190
Before I could aim, off I fell.

8
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:25,190
Father...

9
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:28,670
shall we roast the boar?

10
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:32,140
He was old.

11
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:34,330
His hide is though, it stinks.

12
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:36,210
Indigestible.

13
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:42,380
Like me, old Hidetora

14
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:44,980
Would you eat me?

15
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:47,850
You'd stick in our throats.

16
00:03:48,490 --> 00:03:51,290
That's why I joined your hunt...

17
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:54,890
to reinforce our friendship.

18
00:03:54,930 --> 00:03:56,090
I, too!

19
00:03:57,030 --> 00:03:58,900
I would cement the bonds...

20
00:03:58,930 --> 00:04:02,030
between the houses of
Ichimonji and Ayabe...

21
00:04:02,370 --> 00:04:05,240
I would marry my daughter...

22
00:04:05,270 --> 00:04:08,040
to your son Saburo.

23
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,240
Hold on!

24
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:11,900
That's my own intention.

25
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:16,510
Lord Ichimonji,
the day is propitious.

26
00:04:16,850 --> 00:04:18,550
Give us your answer.

27
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:22,560
Whom will you have for Saburo...

28
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:26,190
my daughter or Lord Ayabe's?

29
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:31,600
Not an easy choice.

30
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:34,070
Two daughters...

31
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:35,730
for one son.

32
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:40,730
A pity, Jiro, my second son,
already has a wife.

33
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,420
Kyoami!

34
00:04:52,790 --> 00:04:54,350
Entertain us!

35
00:05:33,330 --> 00:05:35,760
From the far mountain...

36
00:05:36,930 --> 00:05:39,900
From the near mountain...

37
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:44,000
Who comes hippety-hopping...

38
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:47,740
Showing off his handsome ears?

39
00:05:55,350 --> 00:05:56,750
A hare!

40
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:03,590
Only one hare, Kyoami?

41
00:06:04,290 --> 00:06:05,450
Two, I think.

42
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:11,030
Hopping here to be eaten by
Father.

43
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,600
Suburo, that's rude!

44
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:15,860
Hold your tongue!

45
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:41,890
The Great Lord is tired.

46
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:46,330
Let us withdraw until he wakes.

47
00:07:06,690 --> 00:07:08,420
This is unlike Father.

48
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:11,020
He only pretends to sleep.

49
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:12,860
After Saburo's insult...

50
00:07:12,890 --> 00:07:15,490
how else could he save face?

51
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:50,320
All he did was hunt.

52
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:51,920
In the old days...

53
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:55,450
he'd rout an army
and not be winded.

54
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:58,330
It's impolite to our guests.

55
00:08:59,170 --> 00:09:01,260
Kyoami, wake him!

56
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:03,830
Father worries me...

57
00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:06,600
he's barely snoring today.

58
00:09:10,210 --> 00:09:12,270
Father, what is it?

59
00:09:12,310 --> 00:09:13,470
Are you ill?

60
00:09:19,990 --> 00:09:21,280
A dream...

61
00:09:34,570 --> 00:09:36,200
I had a dream.

62
00:09:38,210 --> 00:09:40,070
I was in a strange land.

63
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:43,700
A vast wilderness.

64
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:48,310
I went on and on,
but met no one.

65
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:51,180
I called, I shouted...

66
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:53,040
but no one answered.

67
00:09:56,420 --> 00:09:57,890
I was alone.

68
00:09:59,930 --> 00:10:03,090
Alone in the wide world.

69
00:10:05,630 --> 00:10:06,830
I felt a chill...

70
00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:26,110
Such stupidity!

71
00:10:26,950 --> 00:10:30,120
Taro's voice pulled me back...

72
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:33,390
I saw my beloved children.

73
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:38,450
Taro...

74
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:41,460
Jiro...

75
00:10:43,670 --> 00:10:44,930
Saburo.

76
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:50,130
Father, I've never
seen you like this.

77
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:51,910
It's not right.

78
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:54,280
Quiet, Saburo!

79
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:57,380
Be thankful we have his
affection.

80
00:10:57,750 --> 00:10:59,410
I'm puzzled, too.

81
00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:02,450
I can scarcely believe my ears.

82
00:11:03,090 --> 00:11:06,580
Normally all he asks is our
obedience.

83
00:11:07,530 --> 00:11:09,120
That's affection enough.

84
00:11:12,270 --> 00:11:13,560
All right.

85
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:22,730
I've been considering an idea...

86
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:25,970
and I've reached a decision.

87
00:11:27,110 --> 00:11:29,670
I want to tell it to you.

88
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:34,150
Now is a good time to do it...

89
00:11:34,490 --> 00:11:36,620
while we have with us...

90
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:39,920
Lords Fujimaki and Ayabe.

91
00:11:43,030 --> 00:11:44,460
Bring them!

92
00:11:55,380 --> 00:11:58,000
I, Hidetora Ichimonji...

93
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:06,440
was born in that small castle
in the mountains.

94
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:10,550
At that time,
this entire plain...

95
00:12:10,590 --> 00:12:13,560
seethed with constant battle.

96
00:12:13,590 --> 00:12:15,460
Many lords vied for power.

97
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:20,630
At the age of seventeen...

98
00:12:22,370 --> 00:12:25,070
I flew my banner
over that castle.

99
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:29,000
I waged war for fifty years...

100
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:34,010
and at last the plain was mine.

101
00:12:36,850 --> 00:12:40,580
I hoisted my colours
over the main castle.

102
00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:43,920
I spent more years...

103
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:45,860
fighting lance to lance...

104
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:48,590
with these two gentlemen.

105
00:12:49,030 --> 00:12:52,020
Now the moment has come...

106
00:12:52,070 --> 00:12:54,400
to stable the steeds of war...

107
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:57,330
and give free rein to peace.

108
00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:02,900
But old Hidetora...

109
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:05,210
is seventy years old.

110
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:15,220
I hereby cede total authority...

111
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:18,730
over all my dominions...

112
00:13:19,390 --> 00:13:21,020
to my eldest son Taro.

113
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:24,620
My lord, this is so sudden...

114
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,370
Not at all.

115
00:13:27,770 --> 00:13:31,400
I've thought long and hard.

116
00:13:31,810 --> 00:13:33,770
There comes a time...

117
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:36,910
to step aside...

118
00:13:37,780 --> 00:13:41,810
and pass on the reins
to younger hands.

119
00:13:41,850 --> 00:13:45,150
I say to you: That time is now!

120
00:13:45,190 --> 00:13:47,620
This is my will.

121
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:52,620
Taro is now head of the
Ichimonjis...

122
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:54,890
Iord of these lands.

123
00:13:54,930 --> 00:13:59,060
I will quit the castle keep...

124
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:00,930
and move to the outer tower.

125
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:04,330
I will retain a 30-man escort...

126
00:14:04,370 --> 00:14:08,070
and the title and insignia
of Great Lord.

127
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:10,770
But the actual leadership...

128
00:14:11,210 --> 00:14:13,240
lies entirely with Taro.

129
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:16,940
I expect all of you to obey!

130
00:14:22,890 --> 00:14:24,520
I'll obey.

131
00:14:25,290 --> 00:14:28,350
But what about me and Saburo?

132
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:31,420
What do you intend for us?

133
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:35,670
I give you, Jiro and Saburo...

134
00:14:36,570 --> 00:14:38,700
the Second and Third Castles...

135
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:40,830
with their attendant lands.

136
00:14:41,210 --> 00:14:43,440
You will support Taro...

137
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:45,670
in the First Castle.

138
00:14:47,650 --> 00:14:50,710
I shall be your guest...

139
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:54,980
visiting each castle in turn...

140
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:57,650
living out my remaining years.

141
00:15:04,930 --> 00:15:06,230
How hard it is to be old.

142
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,000
I would speak.

143
00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:12,460
I respect your wishes...

144
00:15:12,510 --> 00:15:14,840
and appreciate your trust...

145
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:17,070
but I get you to reconsider.

146
00:15:17,110 --> 00:15:18,480
Why?

147
00:15:19,350 --> 00:15:21,180
Though I am your eldest son...

148
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:23,980
I could never take your place.

149
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:26,150
It is too great a task.

150
00:15:26,850 --> 00:15:29,760
I always pray to
the God of War...

151
00:15:29,790 --> 00:15:32,020
"Let his life last 100 years..."

152
00:15:32,060 --> 00:15:35,260
"even if it means
shaving a bit off mine."

153
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,860
What a pretty speech.

154
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:40,230
I cannot use such honeyed words.

155
00:15:40,970 --> 00:15:42,560
I'd be embarrassed.

156
00:15:45,870 --> 00:15:47,340
Don't be spiteful!

157
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:52,200
You mean Taro only flatters me?

158
00:15:53,050 --> 00:15:56,610
Pay no attention to Saburo.

159
00:15:58,490 --> 00:16:00,350
I feel the same as Taro.

160
00:16:00,390 --> 00:16:02,550
We'd like nothing better...

161
00:16:02,590 --> 00:16:05,390
than to stay behind your shield.

162
00:16:05,990 --> 00:16:10,230
But it's our turn
to shield you...

163
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:13,930
from life's bitter arrows.

164
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:16,930
Well said, Jiro.

165
00:16:18,610 --> 00:16:21,200
Bring me that quiver!

166
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:36,920
Break an arrow in two.

167
00:16:42,830 --> 00:16:44,300
Can you do it?

168
00:16:51,140 --> 00:16:52,300
Bundle them...

169
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:56,140
and try again.

170
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:14,020
A single arrow is easily broken.

171
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:16,920
Not so three together.

172
00:17:18,070 --> 00:17:22,530
Whenever Taro is in trouble...

173
00:17:22,570 --> 00:17:25,270
if you unite your forces...

174
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:28,300
the house of Ichimonji
will be safe.

175
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:35,040
Even in a sheaf...

176
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:37,140
3 arrows can be broken.

177
00:17:45,390 --> 00:17:48,330
More of your pranks.

178
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:49,660
Stop being foolish.

179
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:52,160
It's you who are foolish.

180
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:53,360
Your plan is absurd.

181
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:57,370
You are either senile or mad.

182
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:58,560
Silence!

183
00:18:00,770 --> 00:18:02,970
Do not insult your father!

184
00:18:04,780 --> 00:18:07,010
What madness have I spoken?

185
00:18:07,350 --> 00:18:09,870
Wherein lies my senility?

186
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:11,680
I'll tell you.

187
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:15,020
What kind of world do we live
in?

188
00:18:15,390 --> 00:18:18,690
One barren of loyalty and
feeling.

189
00:18:19,190 --> 00:18:20,490
I'm aware of that.

190
00:18:20,530 --> 00:18:21,890
So you should be!

191
00:18:21,930 --> 00:18:24,860
You spilled an ocean of blood.

192
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:27,230
You showed no mercy, no pity.

193
00:18:27,270 --> 00:18:29,570
We too are children
of this age...

194
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:32,570
weaned on strife and chaos.

195
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:38,040
We are your sons,
yet you count on our fidelity.

196
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:41,540
In my eyes,
that makes you a fool.

197
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:43,350
A senile old fool!

198
00:18:52,630 --> 00:18:53,850
So that's it!

199
00:18:57,330 --> 00:18:59,130
You mean one day...

200
00:18:59,170 --> 00:19:01,900
you'll forget I'm your father.

201
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:03,300
You'll betray me.

202
00:19:03,340 --> 00:19:05,360
More folly!

203
00:19:05,410 --> 00:19:07,570
Does a traitor betray himself?

204
00:19:07,610 --> 00:19:09,800
Then you mean your brothers?

205
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:14,080
He's jealous of Taro's position.

206
00:19:15,180 --> 00:19:17,780
Is that why you slander me?

207
00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:20,450
Brother or not, watch your step!

208
00:19:20,490 --> 00:19:24,720
Your lesson of the three arrows
was wasted.

209
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:27,630
The unity of the three sons is
split.

210
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:33,050
You scorn your father's wishes?

211
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:37,090
Parents and children
have no place in this worlds?

212
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:41,010
Very well, since you
will have it so...

213
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:44,240
I cut the bond between us!

214
00:19:45,110 --> 00:19:46,980
You are a stranger to me.

215
00:19:47,010 --> 00:19:48,780
Out of my sight!

216
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:50,280
You mustn't!

217
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:52,650
Quiet, Tango.

218
00:19:54,350 --> 00:19:57,120
My mistake was to love him too
well.

219
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:59,490
I spoiled him.

220
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:04,860
It's my fault he's arrogant.

221
00:20:05,670 --> 00:20:07,790
But it's too late for regrets.

222
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,590
When flesh is rotten...

223
00:20:11,140 --> 00:20:12,870
even our own...

224
00:20:12,910 --> 00:20:14,030
cut it away!

225
00:20:14,070 --> 00:20:15,510
Wait, my lord!

226
00:20:15,540 --> 00:20:17,130
Master Saburo is blunt...

227
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:20,670
perhaps even disrespectful.

228
00:20:20,710 --> 00:20:24,480
But his words are honest
and come from the heart.

229
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:28,180
Consider well: You will find...

230
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:29,880
he is not wrong.

231
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:33,020
- Silence!
- I will speak.

232
00:20:33,060 --> 00:20:34,290
Begone!

233
00:20:34,330 --> 00:20:35,560
I will stay.

234
00:20:35,930 --> 00:20:38,020
You disobey me?

235
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:51,070
My duty to you is to speak my
mind.

236
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:53,740
Brandish your sword, I won't
move.

237
00:20:54,780 --> 00:20:58,010
Revoke this rash decision.

238
00:20:58,050 --> 00:21:00,210
Your insolence matches his!

239
00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:02,310
I will not have it!

240
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:03,920
I banish you both!

241
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:05,220
Father!

242
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:31,070
What misery!

243
00:21:32,850 --> 00:21:35,620
What will you do now?

244
00:21:35,660 --> 00:21:39,150
I grieve for Father, not myself.

245
00:21:39,690 --> 00:21:42,790
The horror ahead of him...

246
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:46,500
Tango, you're an idiot.

247
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,130
Why?

248
00:21:48,170 --> 00:21:50,690
For defending me and being
banished.

249
00:21:51,710 --> 00:21:54,230
Your place is with Father.

250
00:21:55,910 --> 00:21:57,810
He needs you.

251
00:22:12,190 --> 00:22:15,720
They're following us!

252
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:03,640
Wait, son-in-law!

253
00:23:04,910 --> 00:23:07,350
Why do you run away?

254
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:08,510
Son-in-law?

255
00:23:08,550 --> 00:23:10,240
Hear me out!

256
00:23:10,780 --> 00:23:14,620
You're in disgrace,
exiled from your lands.

257
00:23:14,650 --> 00:23:15,990
Lord Ayabe and I...

258
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:20,080
witnessed the whole incident.

259
00:23:21,930 --> 00:23:23,290
You are an outcast...

260
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:26,130
little more than a beggar.

261
00:23:26,670 --> 00:23:28,100
Forgive my rudeness...

262
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:31,400
What I'm trying to say...

263
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:33,100
I can't find the words.

264
00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:34,630
The meaning is clear.

265
00:23:34,670 --> 00:23:36,510
No lord chooses a beggar...

266
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:37,770
for his daughter.

267
00:23:37,810 --> 00:23:38,970
Of course not.

268
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:41,780
No... now hold on!

269
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:46,480
Lord Ayabe rejected the
marriage.

270
00:23:47,290 --> 00:23:50,980
But on my way home
I got to thinking...

271
00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:53,520
of your extraordinary conduct.

272
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:55,930
I like the way you spoke up.

273
00:23:55,960 --> 00:24:00,190
You have character and courage.

274
00:24:00,570 --> 00:24:04,440
You'd make a fine son-in-law.

275
00:24:04,470 --> 00:24:06,700
I retraced my steps...

276
00:24:07,210 --> 00:24:09,140
but you had gone.

277
00:24:09,910 --> 00:24:12,780
Does my offer interest you?

278
00:24:12,810 --> 00:24:15,040
How can I know?

279
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:17,550
Then come stay with me...

280
00:24:17,580 --> 00:24:20,110
while you think it over.

281
00:24:21,190 --> 00:24:22,820
You too, Tango.

282
00:24:23,590 --> 00:24:26,320
You are honest and loyal.

283
00:24:26,690 --> 00:24:30,320
I can use you, will you come?

284
00:24:31,030 --> 00:24:34,020
Thank you for your generosity...

285
00:24:34,070 --> 00:24:37,060
but I cannot accept.

286
00:24:38,670 --> 00:24:42,340
Whatever disguise
I must adopt...

287
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:44,840
I shan't abandon the Great Lord.

288
00:25:18,610 --> 00:25:19,840
What's going on?

289
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:23,280
Hidetora's concubines
are moving from the castle.

290
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:25,510
They block my lady's retinue.

291
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:27,420
Scandalous!

292
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:31,220
I am now the mistress here!

293
00:25:31,260 --> 00:25:33,950
They must make way!

294
00:26:07,590 --> 00:26:11,830
My women kneeling to Taro's
wife?

295
00:26:17,770 --> 00:26:18,930
Intolerable!

296
00:26:20,170 --> 00:26:21,500
Why do you say that?

297
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:25,170
You gave him the castle keep.

298
00:26:26,180 --> 00:26:27,910
It's only natural.

299
00:26:33,150 --> 00:26:35,020
Gives away his house...

300
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:36,780
Gives away his land...

301
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:39,610
His bounty earns him
a new title...

302
00:26:41,030 --> 00:26:42,760
Lord of the rice fields.

303
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:45,770
A scarecrow!

304
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,260
Call me a fool?

305
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:53,130
No, the fool is me...

306
00:26:53,570 --> 00:26:57,630
for serving as butt
to your laughing-stock.

307
00:26:57,680 --> 00:27:01,370
But you're another for losing
your keep.

308
00:27:19,570 --> 00:27:20,730
You know, Kaede...

309
00:27:23,870 --> 00:27:26,340
the view is more pleasant...

310
00:27:27,110 --> 00:27:29,800
now that is it mine.

311
00:27:31,910 --> 00:27:33,340
As I recall...

312
00:27:34,350 --> 00:27:37,750
a banner used to hang there.

313
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:41,510
Yes, Father's banner.

314
00:27:41,550 --> 00:27:43,820
Also his helmet and armour.

315
00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:45,350
Where are they?

316
00:27:45,390 --> 00:27:47,880
I gave them to Father's men.

317
00:27:49,530 --> 00:27:51,520
The armour doesn't matter.

318
00:27:52,370 --> 00:27:53,920
But the banner...

319
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,200
My lord...

320
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:01,940
it belongs with the head
of the house of Ichimonji.

321
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:07,070
But Father is keeping
his title and insignia.

322
00:28:07,410 --> 00:28:10,210
Without them, you are a shadow.

323
00:28:13,420 --> 00:28:14,580
What do you mean?

324
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:17,080
He made it clear...

325
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:20,080
that I am now in command.

326
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:22,920
In that case...

327
00:28:23,630 --> 00:28:26,290
behave as if you are.

328
00:28:49,290 --> 00:28:50,760
You want the banner?

329
00:28:52,660 --> 00:28:55,420
Ridiculous! You take
back what you give.

330
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:58,230
It is Lord Taro's order!

331
00:29:04,270 --> 00:29:07,600
See the lord, a gourd in the
wind.

332
00:29:09,010 --> 00:29:11,740
Swinging this way...

333
00:29:12,110 --> 00:29:14,310
Swaying that way...

334
00:29:14,650 --> 00:29:17,480
Spinning as the breeze blows.

335
00:29:17,950 --> 00:29:22,350
So high up, dangling
hollow from the tower.

336
00:29:23,090 --> 00:29:24,490
Isn't it fun?

337
00:29:30,030 --> 00:29:33,520
Villain! I'll teach you!

338
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:06,130
See the lord, a gourd in the
wind.

339
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:10,740
Swinging this way...

340
00:30:11,570 --> 00:30:14,200
Swaying that way...

341
00:30:14,710 --> 00:30:18,070
Spinning as the breeze blows.

342
00:30:18,110 --> 00:30:19,240
So high up...

343
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:23,220
Dangling hollow from the tower.

344
00:30:23,580 --> 00:30:26,880
What fun, what fun!

345
00:30:30,420 --> 00:30:32,050
It's Ogura.

346
00:30:39,930 --> 00:30:41,200
I have a message.

347
00:30:41,530 --> 00:30:44,530
Lord Taro is holding
a family gathering...

348
00:30:44,570 --> 00:30:47,900
to celebrate the transfer
of power.

349
00:30:47,940 --> 00:30:50,270
He invites his honoured father.

350
00:30:52,050 --> 00:30:53,600
You too, Lord lkoma.

351
00:31:35,620 --> 00:31:37,650
Your "family gathering"...

352
00:31:37,690 --> 00:31:39,020
is only us?

353
00:31:41,660 --> 00:31:43,320
Please, Father-in-Law...

354
00:31:43,930 --> 00:31:46,130
won't you sit down?

355
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,330
I am to sit below you?

356
00:31:52,470 --> 00:31:54,440
Who am I?

357
00:31:55,170 --> 00:31:57,800
The honourable father of my
husband.

358
00:31:58,510 --> 00:32:00,040
Is that all?

359
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:02,310
And the Great Lord...

360
00:32:02,780 --> 00:32:04,310
is he dead?

361
00:32:04,350 --> 00:32:05,580
Don't joke.

362
00:32:05,620 --> 00:32:07,250
I'm not joking!

363
00:32:15,730 --> 00:32:20,130
I retain my title and my status.

364
00:32:20,170 --> 00:32:21,330
Have you forgotten?

365
00:32:21,370 --> 00:32:23,460
No, of course not.

366
00:32:23,970 --> 00:32:25,600
It's you who forget...

367
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:29,940
you gave full authority to me.

368
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:32,140
What do you want?

369
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:35,280
I gave you this castle...

370
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:38,550
I moved out,
reduced my escort...

371
00:32:38,580 --> 00:32:40,180
They may be few in number...

372
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:42,950
but they're boisterous enough.

373
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:46,720
What is that song?

374
00:32:57,700 --> 00:32:59,140
With such goings-on...

375
00:32:59,570 --> 00:33:02,200
how can I make myself obeyed?

376
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:05,730
They are warriors,
unschooled in manners.

377
00:33:06,710 --> 00:33:08,610
They like comic songs.

378
00:33:08,650 --> 00:33:10,640
Comic songs can go too far!

379
00:33:11,250 --> 00:33:14,010
That song makes fun of me!

380
00:33:14,050 --> 00:33:16,650
My guard was defending
my honour.

381
00:33:17,290 --> 00:33:21,090
Yet you went ahead
and killed him.

382
00:33:21,130 --> 00:33:23,430
I cannot allow that.

383
00:33:26,030 --> 00:33:28,500
This once, I'll overlook it.

384
00:33:29,070 --> 00:33:31,940
But I must have your promise...

385
00:33:31,970 --> 00:33:34,410
that it won't happen again.

386
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:45,310
You will sign this...

387
00:33:46,390 --> 00:33:48,220
and seal it with your blood.

388
00:34:00,330 --> 00:34:01,770
"Pledge"...

389
00:34:02,770 --> 00:34:04,760
This is nonsense!

390
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:07,170
Read it.

391
00:34:13,910 --> 00:34:15,110
"Pledge"

392
00:34:15,950 --> 00:34:17,110
"Firstly...

393
00:34:17,650 --> 00:34:21,420
"I cede to Taro Takatora
the domains of Ichimonji."

394
00:34:21,450 --> 00:34:22,650
"Secondly..."

395
00:34:23,090 --> 00:34:27,750
"I make him sole ruler
of the house of Ichimonji."

396
00:34:28,430 --> 00:34:29,590
"Thirdly..."

397
00:34:30,030 --> 00:34:32,790
"Though I am Taro's father..."

398
00:34:32,830 --> 00:34:35,390
"I shall submit
to his authority..."

399
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:37,400
"and act accordingly."

400
00:34:38,340 --> 00:34:41,570
"I swear by all the deities."

401
00:34:41,610 --> 00:34:44,010
"May they punish me
if I disobey."

402
00:34:44,780 --> 00:34:47,140
I'm to seal this with my blood?

403
00:34:47,180 --> 00:34:49,170
This silly thing?

404
00:34:51,620 --> 00:34:53,950
Everything it contains...

405
00:34:54,550 --> 00:34:57,110
was proclaimed by you
yourself...

406
00:34:57,160 --> 00:34:59,250
before witnesses.

407
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:05,260
What does it change
if you sign it?

408
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:53,770
Are you a son?

409
00:35:54,210 --> 00:35:55,340
What do you mean?

410
00:35:55,380 --> 00:35:58,040
Is this a son's attitude?

411
00:35:59,950 --> 00:36:02,180
The hen pecks the cock...

412
00:36:03,460 --> 00:36:05,690
and makes him crow.

413
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:10,490
I will not stay here.

414
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:15,190
Fortunately...

415
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:17,500
I have another son.

416
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:25,940
Thank you, you did well.

417
00:37:04,420 --> 00:37:07,320
I was born and raised
in this castle.

418
00:37:09,820 --> 00:37:11,880
It belonged to my father.

419
00:37:12,660 --> 00:37:15,250
I left it to marry you.

420
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:21,560
My father and brothers,
after the marriage...

421
00:37:22,270 --> 00:37:24,100
relaxed their vigilance.

422
00:37:25,770 --> 00:37:29,230
Hidetora murdered them.

423
00:37:35,310 --> 00:37:39,310
Now I am back
in my family castle...

424
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:45,760
How I have longed for this day.

425
00:38:05,650 --> 00:38:06,910
Right there...

426
00:38:07,810 --> 00:38:10,110
my mother took her own life.

427
00:38:44,750 --> 00:38:46,650
Father is on his way.

428
00:38:49,090 --> 00:38:51,390
My brother sent him packing.

429
00:38:52,530 --> 00:38:54,520
He says Father grows
eccentric...

430
00:38:54,890 --> 00:38:58,560
it would be unwise
to let him stay here.

431
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:01,190
Father's counsellor, lkoma...

432
00:39:01,230 --> 00:39:04,000
is privy to my brother's plans.

433
00:39:21,250 --> 00:39:25,120
This severity is unlike
Lord Taro.

434
00:39:26,930 --> 00:39:28,520
And you, my lord...

435
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:31,050
why do you do nothing?

436
00:39:31,100 --> 00:39:32,260
He's right.

437
00:39:32,670 --> 00:39:36,970
You should succeed
the Great Lord.

438
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:40,460
Lord Taro is a weakling.

439
00:39:41,940 --> 00:39:44,710
The stake is large:
Gamble for it.

440
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:49,610
Then you are all willing...

441
00:39:49,650 --> 00:39:51,550
to gamble with me?

442
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:53,580
Absolutely.

443
00:39:53,620 --> 00:39:55,210
Dogs turn on a master...

444
00:39:55,250 --> 00:39:56,740
who gives up the chase.

445
00:39:56,790 --> 00:39:59,490
Sound the horn or become
the quarry.

446
00:40:00,190 --> 00:40:02,090
How the dogs howl!

447
00:40:06,100 --> 00:40:08,230
I must say, I find it unfair.

448
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:12,570
Born twelve months after Taro...

449
00:40:12,610 --> 00:40:16,300
so all my life
I must grovel at his feet.

450
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:20,980
- Crack these bonds!
- Good for you, my lord!

451
00:40:21,010 --> 00:40:22,980
Don't like your chops yet.

452
00:40:27,350 --> 00:40:28,980
Taro is easy pickings.

453
00:40:29,690 --> 00:40:32,950
His wife, Lady Kaede,
is another story.

454
00:40:34,060 --> 00:40:35,290
Quite true.

455
00:40:36,830 --> 00:40:40,270
She'd be a perfect match
for you.

456
00:40:40,300 --> 00:40:41,990
Why not steal her?

457
00:40:42,030 --> 00:40:44,030
Don't be impertinent.

458
00:40:45,910 --> 00:40:48,140
First of all, there's Father.

459
00:40:49,140 --> 00:40:52,440
He still has thirty warriors.

460
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:55,440
Each one is worth a thousand.

461
00:40:56,650 --> 00:40:58,550
He'll soon be here...

462
00:40:58,580 --> 00:41:00,210
and so will they.

463
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:03,480
Any ideas?

464
00:41:09,830 --> 00:41:10,990
Open the gates!

465
00:41:12,430 --> 00:41:13,800
Hidetora is here!

466
00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:51,100
I will seek out Sue first.

467
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:54,840
Tell Jiro I want to see him.

468
00:42:22,030 --> 00:42:23,330
Sue!

469
00:42:40,150 --> 00:42:42,250
Praise be...

470
00:42:42,290 --> 00:42:47,590
to the Eternal Western Paradise.

471
00:42:48,490 --> 00:42:52,990
Praise be to
the Eternal Buddha...

472
00:42:53,030 --> 00:42:57,090
in 36 trillion manifestations.

473
00:42:57,140 --> 00:43:01,000
Praise be to Amida Buddha.

474
00:43:08,850 --> 00:43:10,640
I knew you'd be here.

475
00:43:10,680 --> 00:43:12,210
Father-in-Law!

476
00:43:14,350 --> 00:43:16,340
Never mind the ceremony.

477
00:43:17,390 --> 00:43:19,450
It's been a long time.

478
00:43:20,830 --> 00:43:22,450
Let me look at you.

479
00:43:26,070 --> 00:43:28,660
Still the same sad face.

480
00:43:29,740 --> 00:43:31,230
When I see you...

481
00:43:31,270 --> 00:43:32,830
it breaks my heart.

482
00:43:44,420 --> 00:43:46,750
It's worse when you smile.

483
00:43:49,890 --> 00:43:52,320
I burned down your castle...

484
00:43:52,360 --> 00:43:54,920
you father and mother perished.

485
00:43:57,230 --> 00:43:59,420
And you look at me like that.

486
00:44:01,700 --> 00:44:04,030
Look upon me with hatred.

487
00:44:04,070 --> 00:44:07,060
It would be easier to bear.

488
00:44:09,240 --> 00:44:12,440
Go on, hate me!

489
00:44:20,150 --> 00:44:21,780
I don't hate you.

490
00:44:24,920 --> 00:44:27,720
All is decided
in our previous lives.

491
00:44:29,160 --> 00:44:31,630
The Buddha embraces all things.

492
00:44:32,230 --> 00:44:33,960
Buddha again!

493
00:44:34,630 --> 00:44:36,530
He is gone from this evil world.

494
00:44:36,570 --> 00:44:38,760
His guardians are in exile...

495
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:41,200
routed by the fury of Ashur.

496
00:44:41,770 --> 00:44:44,300
We can't rely on Buddha's mercy.

497
00:44:45,840 --> 00:44:47,870
There you are, Jiro.

498
00:44:48,510 --> 00:44:51,380
I've come to be your guest.

499
00:44:55,990 --> 00:44:57,320
I'm disappointed in Taro.

500
00:44:58,320 --> 00:44:59,520
I know everything.

501
00:44:59,560 --> 00:45:03,020
It's all in my brother's letter.

502
00:45:04,260 --> 00:45:06,420
Taro wrote to you?

503
00:45:08,030 --> 00:45:09,660
He says your guards...

504
00:45:09,700 --> 00:45:13,370
were unruly and vulgar.

505
00:45:13,410 --> 00:45:16,810
I am to receive you
with courtesy.

506
00:45:16,840 --> 00:45:20,540
But I cannot let
your warriors...

507
00:45:20,580 --> 00:45:22,380
inside the castle walls.

508
00:45:22,410 --> 00:45:23,750
What's this??

509
00:45:25,220 --> 00:45:27,480
I'm to come in alone...

510
00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:30,280
leaving my men to rot outside?

511
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:33,580
My brother is the head
of the clan.

512
00:45:33,630 --> 00:45:37,690
I have no choice
but to obey him.

513
00:45:38,930 --> 00:45:41,260
If you dislike his conditions...

514
00:45:41,700 --> 00:45:44,500
then it might be best...

515
00:45:44,540 --> 00:45:48,770
to go back and apologize.

516
00:45:50,740 --> 00:45:52,210
Apologize to Taro?

517
00:45:53,310 --> 00:45:55,300
Go back?

518
00:46:28,450 --> 00:46:29,610
Stop!

519
00:46:36,090 --> 00:46:38,780
Lord Kurogane. Lord Shirane!

520
00:46:39,590 --> 00:46:41,420
What does this mean?

521
00:46:44,460 --> 00:46:45,690
Lord lkoma!

522
00:46:48,370 --> 00:46:50,100
An order from Hidetora.

523
00:46:50,970 --> 00:46:52,370
"We arrived suddenly..."

524
00:46:53,270 --> 00:46:55,240
"the castle is unprepared."

525
00:46:55,270 --> 00:46:59,870
"Withdraw and wait outside."

526
00:47:15,460 --> 00:47:16,860
Enough is enough.

527
00:47:18,500 --> 00:47:20,060
I understand.

528
00:47:24,470 --> 00:47:25,730
You too...

529
00:47:27,740 --> 00:47:29,570
you're just like Taro.

530
00:47:32,850 --> 00:47:34,940
You want to be rid of me.

531
00:47:34,980 --> 00:47:36,910
I'm too much trouble.

532
00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:39,310
That's not true.

533
00:47:39,650 --> 00:47:43,210
If you were alone,
I'd welcome you gladly.

534
00:47:43,260 --> 00:47:46,520
The Great Lord goes
nowhere alone.

535
00:47:50,500 --> 00:47:52,400
You renounced your power.

536
00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:56,330
You have no need of an escort.

537
00:47:58,070 --> 00:48:00,470
Only the birds and the beasts...

538
00:48:02,110 --> 00:48:04,270
live in solitude.

539
00:48:07,880 --> 00:48:10,080
I've heard enough excuses.

540
00:48:13,120 --> 00:48:14,780
Open the gates!

541
00:48:23,030 --> 00:48:24,830
You needn't worry.

542
00:48:24,860 --> 00:48:27,260
It's not for my men to enter...

543
00:48:27,300 --> 00:48:29,230
but for me to leave!

544
00:48:31,400 --> 00:48:33,100
Open the gates!

545
00:48:54,830 --> 00:48:56,730
Now close them!

546
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:02,490
I will not see you again.

547
00:49:03,340 --> 00:49:04,730
Ever!

548
00:49:42,710 --> 00:49:45,180
The villages are deserted.

549
00:49:45,210 --> 00:49:49,150
Not a grain of rice anywhere.

550
00:49:49,180 --> 00:49:53,210
The peasants took everything
and fled to the mountains.

551
00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:34,920
My lord!

552
00:50:37,030 --> 00:50:39,590
We must go to the Third Castle.

553
00:50:40,270 --> 00:50:41,960
It was your first victory.

554
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:45,560
Go back to where you started...

555
00:50:45,600 --> 00:50:46,760
No, lkoma!

556
00:50:47,370 --> 00:50:49,030
If I could do that...

557
00:50:50,280 --> 00:50:52,940
would I roam the plain hungry?

558
00:50:54,910 --> 00:50:56,440
Use your head!

559
00:50:57,780 --> 00:51:01,550
What kind of welcome
would I get...

560
00:51:02,320 --> 00:51:05,450
I, who banished
the lord of the castle?

561
00:51:47,630 --> 00:51:50,100
By order of
Lord Taro Takatora...

562
00:51:50,140 --> 00:51:52,370
head of the Ichimonji clan...

563
00:51:53,170 --> 00:51:57,200
I take possession
of this castle.

564
00:51:58,810 --> 00:52:00,680
Open the gates!

565
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:19,900
Without our master, Saburo...

566
00:52:20,300 --> 00:52:22,290
the castle is nothing to us.

567
00:52:22,670 --> 00:52:24,640
We leave it to you.

568
00:52:24,970 --> 00:52:28,800
We will follow him
and die for him.

569
00:52:29,340 --> 00:52:33,330
We hear he is with
Lord Fujimaki.

570
00:52:34,410 --> 00:52:36,810
We go to join him.
