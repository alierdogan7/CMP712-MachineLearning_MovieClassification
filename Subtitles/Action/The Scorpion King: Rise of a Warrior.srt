slandering my name.

179
00:18:57,436 --> 00:18:59,961
And the punishment is death.

180
00:19:02,107 --> 00:19:04,337
Wait. But this is my...
I know.

181
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:06,004
You do the deed yourself,

182
00:19:06,078 --> 00:19:08,740
you prove your loyalty to me
beyond a shadow of a doubt.

183
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:12,450
I'll permit you
to make it quick.

184
00:19:15,254 --> 00:19:17,051
Mathayus! I'm sorry.

185
00:19:20,859 --> 00:19:22,349
Is this true?

186
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:26,089
Did you slander the king?

187
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:27,325
Mathayus! Please!

188
00:19:27,399 --> 00:19:28,491
Answer me!

189
00:19:29,902 --> 00:19:31,836
Are the charges true?

190
00:19:32,671 --> 00:19:33,865
Yes.

191
00:19:34,373 --> 00:19:36,705
Then you deserve
what's coming to you.

192
00:19:36,775 --> 00:19:40,575
You've not only betrayed your king,
but your family as well.

193
00:19:41,046 --> 00:19:44,015
And you've disgraced
our father's name.

don't flinch.

Go.

Mathayus, I just want
a life of adventure.

248
00:25:49,581 --> 00:25:51,515
And battle.
Like a man.

249
00:25:52,017 --> 00:25:54,076
There's one small problem.

250
00:25:54,419 --> 00:25:55,886
You're not a man.

251
00:25:55,954 --> 00:25:57,251
Thanks for noticing.

252
00:25:58,156 --> 00:25:59,384
Hey!

253
00:25:59,858 --> 00:26:02,418
I heard you tried
to kill Sargon.

254
00:26:02,494 --> 00:26:06,021
Hey, listen.
I will kill that bastard some day.

255
00:26:06,464 --> 00:26:08,659
Everyone knows he makes sacrifices
to the dark gods,

256
00:26:08,733 --> 00:26:10,826
and they've given him
black magical powers.

257

all the help you can get.

only get in the way.

Look, we're not kids anymore

on how to become
an arrogant jerk.

with flying colors.

Ten pieces.

270
00:26:50,408 --> 00:26:52,239
Ten? That's pretty steep.

271
00:26:52,310 --> 00:26:54,141
Plus one for insurance.

272
00:26:54,212 --> 00:26:56,339
And I highly recommend it,
because there are pirates,

273
00:26:56,414 --> 00:26:58,974

and hurricanes.

never to mix those two words together.

288
00:27:55,607 --> 00:27:57,438
You are following me.

289
00:27:57,742 --> 00:27:58,970
Admit it.

290
00:27:59,044 --> 00:28:01,342
You know, this may come
as a shock to you,

291
00:28:01,413 --> 00:28:04,849
but not everything
in the world happens because of you.

292
00:28:04,916 --> 00:28:06,508
Then why are you
going to Egypt?

293
00:28:06,584 --> 00:28:07,915
Because...

294
00:28:08,486 --> 00:28:12,479
Everyone should go and see the pyramids
once in their lives.

295
00:28:12,991 --> 00:28:15,221
Why are you going to Egypt?

296
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:17,054
Personal matters

297
00:28:17,462 --> 00:28:19,521
which don't concern you.

298
00:28:19,864 --> 00:28:23,857
Don't play coy with me.
You know I'll get it out of you anyway.

299
00:28:27,172 --> 00:28:28,161
All right.

300
00:28:28,239 --> 00:28:31,606
My father once fought for the pharaoh's
private guard and saved his life.

301
00:28:31,676 --> 00:28:34,201
So, I'm going to ask if in return
he'll let me borrow

302
00:28:34,279 --> 00:28:37,271
the Spear of Osiris
to help me defeat Sargon.

303
00:28:38,116 --> 00:28:40,175
The Pharaoh of Egypt

304
00:28:41,352 --> 00:28:44,150
is going to lend one of the most
fabled weapons in history

305
00:28:44,222 --> 00:28:47,282
to a 19-year-old kid
he's never even heard of?

306
00:28:47,826 --> 00:28:49,157
I don't remember
asking your opinion.

307
00:28:49,227 --> 00:28:50,854
Actually,

308
00:28:51,362 --> 00:28:54,297
I'm afraid she's right.
It wouldn't work.

309
00:28:55,133 --> 00:28:57,931
But mainly for the simple reason
that the Spear of Osiris

310
00:28:58,002 --> 00:29:00,903
is only effective
against Egyptian monsters.

311
00:29:00,972 --> 00:29:04,499
Such as the winged scarab,
sphinxes and cursed mummies.

312
00:29:05,777 --> 00:29:07,768
And you know this how?

313
00:29:08,313 --> 00:29:10,873
Let's just say
I'm well connected.

314
00:29:10,949 --> 00:29:13,281
Really? And who
are you exactly?

315
00:29:14,486 --> 00:29:16,716
Aristophanes of Naxos.

316
00:29:16,788 --> 00:29:20,417
Not to be confused with the Aristophanes
from Corinth. That hack.

317
00:29:20,492 --> 00:29:23,484
I speak 20 languages fluently
and another 20 passably.

318
00:29:23,561 --> 00:29:25,426
So if you need
any translation services...

319
00:29:25,497 --> 00:29:28,660
Yes, yes. How did you learn
about the Spear of Osiris?

320
00:29:28,733 --> 00:29:32,134
I am a poet and playwright by trade
and sometimes a musician.

321
00:29:32,203 --> 00:29:35,900
And was most recently
court poet to the king of Elam.

322
00:29:37,142 --> 00:29:41,044
Petty despot. May he rot in the
underworld for his lack of esthetic taste.

323
00:29:41,112 --> 00:29:44,309
And learned of it from one of
his high priests.

324
00:29:44,382 --> 00:29:47,317
But you are thinking
along the right path.

325
00:29:47,719 --> 00:29:51,120
To defeat a man like Sargon,
well-versed in the black arts,

326
00:29:51,189 --> 00:29:54,022
one would require
a potent weapon indeed.

327
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:56,686
Like?

328
00:29:57,295 --> 00:29:58,694
Let's see.

329
00:29:59,197 --> 00:30:01,927
There's the Hammer of Zeus.
No, too unwieldy.

330
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,662
The Shield of Cronos.
That's completely discredited.

331
00:30:04,736 --> 00:30:06,067
The Cloak of...

332
00:30:06,137 --> 00:30:10,665
I've got it!
The Sword of Damocles!

333
00:30:11,776 --> 00:30:13,004
The what?

334
00:30:13,077 --> 00:30:15,011
Damocles. You know.

335
00:30:17,148 --> 00:30:18,638
The one condemned to die
a thousand deaths

336
00:30:18,716 --> 00:30:22,550
by the very hand of the sword that he used
to kill King Philpman.

337
00:30:24,055 --> 00:30:25,488
(GROANS)

338
00:30:25,623 --> 00:30:28,456
What do they teach you
in Akkadian schools these days?

339
00:30:28,526 --> 00:30:30,960
Not to touch
other men's swords.

340
00:30:31,462 --> 00:30:33,521
Well, in any case,

341
00:30:33,598 --> 00:30:36,590
according to Book Five of
Herodotus' <i>Histories,</i>

342
00:30:36,668 --> 00:30:40,570
Damocles' infamous sword was transformed
by a lightning bolt from Zeus

343
00:30:40,638 --> 00:30:44,665
into a wondrous weapon whose blade
could cut through anything.

344
00:30:44,742 --> 00:30:46,767
Mortal or immortal.

345
00:30:46,845 --> 00:30:50,372
And presented as a gift
to the Queen of the Underworld.

346
00:30:50,448 --> 00:30:53,246
You're saying this sword
can cut through anything?

347
00:30:53,318 --> 00:30:54,751
Oh, please.

348
00:30:55,453 --> 00:30:56,784
Anything.

349
00:30:58,022 --> 00:31:00,388
And you know
where this sword is?

350
00:31:00,458 --> 00:31:03,052
This has to be the most harebrained
scheme I've heard yet today,

351
00:31:03,127 --> 00:31:05,254
and that is saying plenty.

352
00:31:05,330 --> 00:31:07,696
Oh, and you
have a better idea.

353
00:31:09,968 --> 00:31:11,765
Okay. I've decided.

00:31:12,670 --> 00:31:15,400
We're gonna continue
on our journey to Knossos.

355
00:31:15,473 --> 00:31:18,567
And you're gonna lead me
to the Sword of Damocles.

356
00:31:18,643 --> 00:31:22,272
My friend, such a journey would be
fraught with perils.

357
00:31:22,347 --> 00:31:25,373
The Underworld is a grim and
dangerous place of condemned souls

358
00:31:25,450 --> 00:31:26,439

363
00:31:35,026 --> 00:31:37,688
For risking my life,
it's a pittance.

364
00:31:41,666 --> 00:31:44,863
A lady doesn't part
with her dowry that easily.

365
00:31:45,403 --> 00:31:46,392

just remember this.

377
00:32:24,342 --> 00:32:27,243
Akkadian women are just as handy with
a dagger as Akkadian men.

378
00:32:27,312 --> 00:32:30,543

us into that.

But then we need
to find the labyrinth.

398
00:34:03,608 --> 00:34:06,338

lies within the labyrinth.

00:46:22,112 --> 00:46:25,240
No one has ever returned alive
from that place.

537
00:46:25,315 --> 00:46:26,942
MATHAYUS: Gilgamesh did it.
Never heard of him.

538
00:46:27,017 --> 00:46:28,279
So did Herodotus.

539
00:46:28,352 --> 00:46:29,410
So he claims.

540
00:46:29,486 --> 00:46:30,748
Do you know
what else he claims?

541
00:46:30,821 --> 00:46:32,652
When he visited the Underworld
he saw with his own eyes

542
00:46:32,723 --> 00:46:36,090
enough gold, diamonds and rubies
to fill a thousand arenas.

543
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:39,095
He was literally crunching on a fortune
with every step.

544
00:46:39,163 --> 00:46:43,691
But you, veteran warriors, wouldn't be
interested in such a hazardous journey

545
00:46:43,767 --> 00:46:46,565
as that taken
by an old Greek historian.

546
00:46:46,637 --> 00:46:51,301
And soon by a poet, a young Akkadian lad
and a girl.

547
00:46:53,443 --> 00:46:55,434
Greeks. Greeks.

548
00:47:02,119 --> 00:47:03,746
(SPEAKING CANTONESE)

549
00:47:07,791 --> 00:47:08,917
Okay.

550
00:47:14,131 --> 00:47:15,826
(SPEAKING CANTONESE)

551
00:47:19,503 --> 00:47:21,437
Wait. Why is he coming?

552
00:47:22,306 --> 00:47:25,139
Well, I thought
we could use the extra body.

553
00:47:25,209 --> 00:47:28,804
I told him the Underworld
was a shortcut back to China.

554
00:47:50,767 --> 00:47:51,995
Now what?

555
00:47:52,069 --> 00:47:54,435
ARI: The portal is
in here somewhere.
