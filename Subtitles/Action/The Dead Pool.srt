1
00:01:42,777 --> 00:01:46,611
<i>A fire that claimed three lives</i>
<i>in a South Bay warehouse yesterday...</i>

2
00:01:46,814 --> 00:01:49,715
<i>... is believed to have been</i>
<i>deliberately set.</i>

3
00:01:49,918 --> 00:01:53,183
<i>South Bay has been plagued</i>
<i>by a series of fires...</i>

4
00:01:53,388 --> 00:01:54,855
<i>... all of a similar nature.</i>

5
00:01:55,056 --> 00:01:57,490
<i>Authorities believe</i>
<i>arson is involved.</i>

6
00:01:57,692 --> 00:01:59,592
<i>They have no suspects at this time.</i>

7
00:02:01,529 --> 00:02:05,727
<i>Jazz composer Edward Barla was</i>
<i>eulogized today in a private ceremony.</i>

8
00:02:05,934 --> 00:02:09,893
<i>Barla was best known for the tunes</i>
<i>"Midnight Hearts" and "Just For You."</i>

9
00:02:10,104 --> 00:02:12,231
<i>Edward Barla, dead at the age of 56.</i>

10
00:02:15,009 --> 00:02:19,810
<i>The murder trial of Lou Janero ended</i>
<i>today. Samantha Walker has the story.</i>

11
00:02:20,014 --> 00:02:21,709
<i>After four days of deliberation...</i>

12
00:02:21,916 --> 00:02:25,784
<i>... the jury found Lou Janero guilty</i>
<i>of the murder of Paul Cirela.</i>

13
00:02:25,987 --> 00:02:30,651
<i>Cirela, part of Janero's organization,</i>
<i>was set to testify against Janero...</i>

14
00:02:30,858 --> 00:02:34,794
<i>... in an upcoming trial on charges</i>
<i>of bookmaking and tax evasion.</i>

15
00:02:34,996 --> 00:02:39,330
<i>Assistant D.A., Thomas McSherry,</i>
<i>credited Inspector Harry Callahan...</i>

16
00:02:39,534 --> 00:02:43,937
<i>... for his part in the successful</i>
<i>prosecution of Lou Janero.</i>

17
00:02:44,138 --> 00:02:48,006
<i>A great deal of the credit</i>
<i>should go to Inspector Callahan.</i>

18
00:02:48,209 --> 00:02:50,336
<i>He put Lou Janero out of business.</i>

19
00:02:51,212 --> 00:02:56,172
<i>The inspector's evidence not only</i>
<i>implicated Janero in the murder...</i>

20
00:02:56,384 --> 00:03:01,253
<i>... but also provided the means to file</i>
<i>additional charges against Janero...</i>

21
00:03:01,456 --> 00:03:03,424
<i>... for bookmaking</i>
<i>and illegal gambling.</i>

22
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:08,888
<i>I'm Samantha Walker for Channel 8.</i>
<i>Back to you, Pat.</i>

23
00:04:54,869 --> 00:04:56,837
Get off my ass.

24
00:06:36,170 --> 00:06:37,398
He's going.

25
00:06:40,174 --> 00:06:42,608
Did you recognize
any of the attackers?

26
00:06:42,810 --> 00:06:46,507
Is this attack connected to your
testimony at the Janero trial?

27
00:06:46,714 --> 00:06:49,808
Has Janero put out a contract
on your life?

28
00:06:50,017 --> 00:06:51,644
Were these Janero's men?

29
00:06:51,852 --> 00:06:53,649
Have you received death threats?

30
00:06:54,455 --> 00:06:57,015
Has the department offered
any extra protection?

31
00:06:57,225 --> 00:07:00,217
The department will issue
a complete statement...

32
00:07:00,428 --> 00:07:03,727
...as soon as we've conducted
our own investigation.

33
00:07:04,265 --> 00:07:07,701
$13,453.63.

34
00:07:07,902 --> 00:07:10,666
That's how much
an unmarked squad car costs.

35
00:07:10,871 --> 00:07:13,362
That's the third car
you've trashed this month.

36
00:07:13,574 --> 00:07:15,474
- Lou Janero.
- What?

37
00:07:15,676 --> 00:07:18,110
His men shot up the car.
Send him the bill.

38
00:07:18,312 --> 00:07:19,210
Very funny.

39
00:07:19,413 --> 00:07:23,281
See how funny it is behind a desk,
because you're off the street.

40
00:07:23,484 --> 00:07:24,781
All this for a car?

41
00:07:24,986 --> 00:07:27,147
At Lieutenant Ackerman's request.

42
00:07:27,355 --> 00:07:29,585
The chief approved.
It's for your own good.

43
00:07:29,790 --> 00:07:33,590
- If you think I'm gonna...
- Just until we handle Janero.

44
00:07:33,794 --> 00:07:37,855
He may be in prison, but it's clear
he's calling the shots. Literally.

45
00:07:38,065 --> 00:07:42,764
Can't have our newest hero turned to
Swiss cheese before the commendation.

46
00:07:42,970 --> 00:07:45,871
See? You're getting a commendation.

47
00:07:47,041 --> 00:07:48,565
Swell.

48
00:07:50,845 --> 00:07:53,814
It's time we took advantage
of the press you're getting.

49
00:07:54,015 --> 00:07:55,880
How do you propose to do that?

50
00:07:56,083 --> 00:08:00,782
It's my opinion that you should
work with me in public relations.

51
00:08:00,988 --> 00:08:04,185
Opinions are like assholes.
Everybody has one.

52
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:09,896
You don't realize what you've done
for the department's image.

53
00:08:10,097 --> 00:08:12,622
You just put a major
crime figure in prison.

54
00:08:12,833 --> 00:08:15,700
You've got an extremely high
visibility right now.

55
00:08:15,903 --> 00:08:17,370
And for once, it's positive.

56
00:08:17,605 --> 00:08:20,267
You know what that means
in terms of recruitment?

57
00:08:20,474 --> 00:08:23,272
Look at this.
Look at this copy we're getting.

58
00:08:23,477 --> 00:08:26,708
We've never been
this swamped for interviews.

59
00:08:26,914 --> 00:08:29,474
I'm not some dog-and-pony act.

60
00:08:30,618 --> 00:08:34,452
It's important we maximize your public
relations value while we can.

61
00:08:34,655 --> 00:08:38,489
Getting close and personal
with reporters isn't my job.

62
00:08:38,693 --> 00:08:41,253
Your job is to promote the department.

63
00:08:41,462 --> 00:08:44,056
How positive would it be
if I resigned...

64
00:08:44,265 --> 00:08:45,630
...lieutenant?

65
00:08:49,403 --> 00:08:51,200
Don't misunderstand me.

66
00:08:51,405 --> 00:08:54,966
Harry, all I'm asking for
is a little cooperation.

67
00:08:56,344 --> 00:09:00,041
All right, we don't have to pull you
off the street completely.

68
00:09:00,247 --> 00:09:02,647
If you'd just be more cooperative
with the press.

69
00:09:02,850 --> 00:09:03,839
Anything else?

70
00:09:04,051 --> 00:09:05,484
Yeah.

71
00:09:06,721 --> 00:09:08,382
Quan, will you come in here?

72
00:09:10,091 --> 00:09:14,187
Quan's moving over from the youth gang
task force to Homicide.

73
00:09:14,395 --> 00:09:17,796
Good, Homicide can always use a cop
with Al's experience.

74
00:09:17,998 --> 00:09:19,192
I'm glad you agree.

75
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:23,268
If you want to stay on the street,
you take Quan to watch your back.

76
00:09:23,471 --> 00:09:25,200
- Now hold on.
- That's final.

77
00:09:25,406 --> 00:09:29,968
That's swell, being that most
of my partners end up hurt or dead.

78
00:09:30,177 --> 00:09:32,270
Ask Al how he feels about that.

79
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:36,075
Well, Quan? Any objections
to working with Callahan?

80
00:09:36,283 --> 00:09:38,376
I think I can handle it.

81
00:09:39,186 --> 00:09:40,744
Get a bulletproof vest, kid.

82
00:09:41,689 --> 00:09:46,490
Teaming Harry with a Chinese-American
will be good for the department image.

83
00:09:52,733 --> 00:09:53,927
You have any kids?

84
00:09:54,135 --> 00:09:55,830
Me? No.

85
00:09:56,170 --> 00:09:57,694
Lucky for them.

86
00:11:25,092 --> 00:11:26,389
Cut. Cut!

87
00:11:27,628 --> 00:11:31,086
You're out of sync, Johnny.
What's the problem here?

88
00:11:33,434 --> 00:11:34,867
Where is that fool?

89
00:11:35,069 --> 00:11:36,263
Jeff!

90
00:11:36,604 --> 00:11:37,571
Jeff!

91
00:11:37,771 --> 00:11:39,363
We've had a short, Peter.

92
00:11:39,573 --> 00:11:42,007
You had all the bugs out.
"Trust me," you said.

93
00:11:42,209 --> 00:11:44,177
- Right? Did he say that?
- "Trust me."

94
00:11:44,378 --> 00:11:47,006
That means "fuck you"
in this business.

95
00:11:47,214 --> 00:11:48,044
I checked it.

96
00:11:48,249 --> 00:11:51,514
I've got a backup head.
Give me 20 minutes and we'll be ready.

97
00:11:51,819 --> 00:11:54,617
All right, do it.
And no cock-ups this time.

98
00:11:54,822 --> 00:11:57,552
And that goes for the rest
of you morons.

99
00:11:59,827 --> 00:12:01,624
This sucks, man.

100
00:12:02,396 --> 00:12:05,229
How can I sing
with shit exploding all over?

101
00:12:05,432 --> 00:12:06,865
It was just an accident.

102
00:12:07,067 --> 00:12:09,331
This whole movie is an accident.

103
00:12:09,537 --> 00:12:12,165
How did I get talked into this shit?

104
00:12:12,373 --> 00:12:15,672
You needed a video.
I needed this sequence for the film.

105
00:12:15,876 --> 00:12:18,310
Stop complaining,
we're getting what we want.

106
00:12:18,512 --> 00:12:23,381
Why couldn't we shoot on a warm
sound stage, instead of a meat locker?

107
00:12:23,584 --> 00:12:27,816
I need it cold so the audience
can see your breath when you sing.

108
00:12:28,022 --> 00:12:29,080
Brilliant.

109
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:33,454
We won't be original, but people
will know I froze my ass off.

110
00:12:33,661 --> 00:12:35,094
What's that supposed to mean?

111
00:12:35,296 --> 00:12:40,131
A director with talent would have
the guts to shoot something original.

112
00:12:40,334 --> 00:12:43,269
Instead of ripping off old movies
like <i>The Exorcist.</i>

113
00:12:43,470 --> 00:12:47,907
This is not a rip-off,
it's a homage. You stupid...

114
00:12:52,513 --> 00:12:54,344
Jesus, I don't believe you.

115
00:12:55,149 --> 00:12:56,013
What?

116
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:57,444
You're hurting.

117
00:12:58,819 --> 00:13:00,252
I don't know what you mean.

118
00:13:00,454 --> 00:13:03,321
Don't give me that.
You promised, not during shooting.

119
00:13:03,524 --> 00:13:06,288
I know what I'm doing.

120
00:13:06,493 --> 00:13:07,482
I can handle it.

121
00:13:07,695 --> 00:13:09,128
You won't fuck up my film!

122
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:10,763
I said, I can handle it!

123
00:13:14,034 --> 00:13:18,630
Just let me go back to the trailer
and get it together.

124
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:21,540
Then we'll kick some ass.

125
00:13:21,742 --> 00:13:23,300
- OIKK?
- OIKK.

126
00:13:23,677 --> 00:13:24,644
Can I get a Coke?

127
00:13:24,845 --> 00:13:27,075
Get a Coke, please, for Johnny.

128
00:13:28,916 --> 00:13:29,780
Now what?

129
00:13:29,984 --> 00:13:32,475
Don't worry,
Johnny's like a trained seal.

130
00:13:32,686 --> 00:13:34,881
Throw him a fish, he'll perform.

131
00:13:58,512 --> 00:14:00,605
Rise and shine, boys.

132
00:14:01,915 --> 00:14:03,746
Time to get up.

133
00:14:44,825 --> 00:14:46,554
What's happening?

134
00:15:37,644 --> 00:15:41,045
I always knew working Homicide
would be glamorous.

135
00:15:41,248 --> 00:15:43,876
I mean, meeting celebrities and all.

136
00:15:44,818 --> 00:15:47,343
Too bad you can't get his autograph.

137
00:15:48,155 --> 00:15:51,215
You know, Harry,
they always die in threes.

138
00:15:51,825 --> 00:15:55,488
When one celebrity dies, two more
always go in a week or two.

139
00:15:56,864 --> 00:15:58,263
It's a fact, Harry.

140
00:15:58,465 --> 00:16:00,330
Celebrities always die in threes.

141
00:16:00,534 --> 00:16:04,265
Well, this one's got crystalline
powder around his nose and mouth.

142
00:16:04,471 --> 00:16:06,496
Scabs up and down both arms.

143
00:16:06,707 --> 00:16:10,040
Fresh puncture marks
on his left forearm.

144
00:16:11,345 --> 00:16:15,509
Yeah, Homicide can be
really glamorous.

145
00:16:38,806 --> 00:16:41,104
All right,
check the dummy out, please.

146
00:16:41,708 --> 00:16:43,141
Meagan.

147
00:16:46,613 --> 00:16:49,241
I want a three-inch lens, very tight.

148
00:16:50,317 --> 00:16:51,716
Try not to drop it.

149
00:16:51,919 --> 00:16:55,719
Let's hurry up and shoot this
and wrap this up, please.

150
00:17:05,566 --> 00:17:09,297
And my second assistant and I
found Johnny in his trailer.

151
00:17:09,770 --> 00:17:11,499
He was just lying there.

152
00:17:11,705 --> 00:17:14,037
At first we thought it was a joke.

153
00:17:14,341 --> 00:17:17,242
- But then, well...
- When did you last see him alive?

154
00:17:17,444 --> 00:17:19,207
About a half-hour before that.

155
00:17:19,413 --> 00:17:22,314
He went back to his trailer
while we set up.

156
00:17:22,516 --> 00:17:23,608
Was he alone?

157
00:17:23,817 --> 00:17:26,786
I don't know.
But he was alone when we found him.

158
00:17:27,521 --> 00:17:30,217
Tell me, does anyone
on your set use drugs?

159
00:17:30,424 --> 00:17:33,689
We don't do drugs, Callahan.
We do film.

160
00:17:35,262 --> 00:17:37,856
Look, what people do
is their own business.

161
00:17:38,065 --> 00:17:42,161
If it doesn't interfere with my film,
I really don't give a shit.

162
00:17:47,074 --> 00:17:48,871
What about Squares? Was he using?

163
00:17:49,076 --> 00:17:51,203
How should I know?

164
00:17:51,411 --> 00:17:53,311
Johnny had agents, lawyers, friends.

165
00:17:53,513 --> 00:17:57,142
It was their job to deal with his
drug problem, not mine.

166
00:17:57,351 --> 00:17:59,683
Well, that's a very caring attitude.

167
00:18:00,087 --> 00:18:03,716
What do you want, Callahan?
Drugs were Johnny's trademark.

168
00:18:03,924 --> 00:18:06,290
He made his career singing about them.

169
00:18:06,493 --> 00:18:08,085
It made him controversial.

170
00:18:08,562 --> 00:18:11,326
I can see why you'd want him
in your flick.

171
00:18:11,531 --> 00:18:13,226
It was a marketing decision.

172
00:18:13,433 --> 00:18:17,199
Johnny Squares sells tickets.
You know, bums on seats, love.

173
00:18:17,404 --> 00:18:19,668
Besides, we needed
a music video tie-in.

174
00:18:19,873 --> 00:18:21,602
Any idea who was supplying him?

175
00:18:23,410 --> 00:18:27,403
No, but if I hear of anything,
you'll be the first one I call.

176
00:18:27,614 --> 00:18:29,548
Marvelous.

177
00:18:35,455 --> 00:18:38,322
Check on anyone
who dealt with Squares.

178
00:18:38,525 --> 00:18:41,961
- Whether it was the cast or crew...
- Inspector Callahan.

179
00:18:42,429 --> 00:18:44,056
Inspector.

180
00:18:44,264 --> 00:18:45,697
Shit.

181
00:18:46,066 --> 00:18:48,591
Is it true that Johnny Squares OD'd?

182
00:18:48,802 --> 00:18:51,327
We're conducting an investigation.

183
00:18:51,538 --> 00:18:54,632
Right as we speak.
At this point, nothing's been...

184
00:18:54,841 --> 00:18:57,002
Thank you, inspector.

185
00:19:00,647 --> 00:19:02,774
Excuse me, are you Suzanne Dayton?

186
00:19:02,983 --> 00:19:04,314
What's going on here?

187
00:19:04,518 --> 00:19:05,849
Johnny?

188
00:19:06,219 --> 00:19:07,584
Johnny?

189
00:19:08,055 --> 00:19:10,216
Hold it. I'm sorry,
you have to step back.

190
00:19:10,424 --> 00:19:12,688
- No, Johnny!
- There's nothing they can do.

191
00:19:16,797 --> 00:19:18,731
You're gonna make yourself sick.

192
00:19:18,932 --> 00:19:21,867
Hold on, could we
give her a little air?

193
00:19:22,836 --> 00:19:24,235
Out of the way, please.

194
00:19:30,510 --> 00:19:31,977
Off with that camera.

195
00:19:32,179 --> 00:19:34,579
I can film whatever I want.
IKKeep shooting.

196
00:19:34,815 --> 00:19:36,680
This is someone else's heartache.

197
00:19:36,883 --> 00:19:38,350
Right in here.

198
00:19:38,552 --> 00:19:41,077
What are you doing? Give me that.

199
00:19:50,731 --> 00:19:52,221
Smart.

200
00:20:56,930 --> 00:21:00,798
High and Dry <i>is the kind of</i>
<i>mindless film comedy...</i>

201
00:21:01,001 --> 00:21:05,335
<i>... that's come to typify summer films</i>
<i>aimed at the youth market.</i>

202
00:21:05,539 --> 00:21:08,940
<i>The humor is of the</i>
<i>locker-room variety.</i>

203
00:21:09,142 --> 00:21:13,306
<i>Audiences seeking more sophistication</i>
<i>will have to look elsewhere.</i>

204
00:21:13,513 --> 00:21:14,605
<i>The producers...</i>

205
00:21:14,915 --> 00:21:18,442
<i>Rock star Johnny Squares</i>
<i>was found dead this afternoon.</i>

206
00:21:18,652 --> 00:21:21,212
<i>Samantha Walker filed this report.</i>

207
00:21:22,389 --> 00:21:26,792
<i>The body of Johnny Squares was found</i>
<i>today at the Royal Meat Company...</i>

208
00:21:26,993 --> 00:21:29,962
<i>... where he was on location</i>
<i>filming</i> Hotel Satan.

209
00:21:30,163 --> 00:21:35,226
<i>The cause of death is not known,</i>
<i>but Squares had a history of drug use.</i>

210
00:21:35,435 --> 00:21:39,030
<i>The rock star was arrested last July</i>
<i>for possession of heroin.</i>

211
00:21:39,239 --> 00:21:43,005
<i>Many of his songs were allegedly</i>
<i>based on his drug experience.</i>

212
00:22:06,099 --> 00:22:07,589
What's that all about?

213
00:22:07,801 --> 00:22:09,826
My past catching up with me.

214
00:22:10,036 --> 00:22:14,200
As a kid, I was in the gang
that hit him up for protection money.

215
00:22:14,608 --> 00:22:18,442
All my life, I've been running in
gangs or trying to put them away.

216
00:22:18,645 --> 00:22:23,048
So I figured I'd come over to Homicide
for something different.

217
00:22:23,250 --> 00:22:25,218
It's different, all right.

218
00:22:29,289 --> 00:22:30,551
Call for backup.

219
00:22:38,031 --> 00:22:40,659
Come on, get the fuck out of here.
Hurry up!

220
00:22:53,780 --> 00:22:54,872
Move it! Move it!

221
00:22:55,081 --> 00:22:57,515
Put your money on the table!
Hurry up!

222
00:22:57,717 --> 00:22:58,877
Don't move!

223
00:22:59,085 --> 00:23:00,985
Don't fuck with me, lady!

224
00:23:01,354 --> 00:23:02,981
Come on, guys, hurry up!

225
00:23:03,190 --> 00:23:05,351
- You forgot your fortune cookie.
- What!?

226
00:23:13,833 --> 00:23:14,731
It says:

227
00:23:16,336 --> 00:23:17,769
"You're shit out of luck."

228
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:41,549
Get out of the way!

229
00:24:11,424 --> 00:24:15,861
"Teaming up with a Chinese-American is
good for the department's image."

230
00:24:33,647 --> 00:24:34,671
Who was he?

231
00:24:34,881 --> 00:24:37,679
Some guy in the wrong place
at the wrong time.

232
00:24:37,884 --> 00:24:40,182
Madison. Dean Madison was his name.

233
00:24:40,387 --> 00:24:41,752
Does it ring a bell?

234
00:24:42,589 --> 00:24:45,752
- Never heard of him.
- Well, he knew you, Harry.

235
00:24:45,959 --> 00:24:49,190
I found this in his pocket.
It's a list of celebrities.

236
00:24:49,796 --> 00:24:53,789
Tony Engelhart, the pro linebacker.
Michael Cipriano, the race car driver.

237
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:57,436
Oh, and one Inspector Harry Callahan.

238
00:24:58,938 --> 00:25:02,931
Johnny Squares is on that list.
See what's written by his name?

239
00:25:03,943 --> 00:25:07,538
Yeah, RIP. "Rest in peace."

240
00:25:10,150 --> 00:25:11,515
You know what this is?

241
00:25:11,718 --> 00:25:14,016
It's a bill for a TV camera and lens.

242
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:18,281
When I said stop wrecking cars,
I didn't mean destroy something else.

243
00:25:18,491 --> 00:25:21,051
They interfered
with an investigation, sir.

244
00:25:21,261 --> 00:25:24,992
Don't give us that. Is this
your idea of media cooperation?

245
00:25:25,198 --> 00:25:27,393
Cooperation works two ways.

246
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:30,091
What is it you have against reporters?

247
00:25:30,303 --> 00:25:32,737
Some of them
are just marvelous people.

248
00:25:32,939 --> 00:25:36,932
Others walk through a pile and track
it through an investigation.

249
00:25:37,143 --> 00:25:39,304
You better change
your attitude fast.

250
00:25:39,512 --> 00:25:42,447
Because unless we
reach an agreement with them...

251
00:25:42,649 --> 00:25:46,244
...it's liable to cost this city
2 million, and your career.

252
00:25:48,421 --> 00:25:49,752
Join us, please.

253
00:25:49,956 --> 00:25:52,618
This is Ms. Samantha Walker
of station IKKWSF.

254
00:25:52,826 --> 00:25:53,724
Captain Donnelly.

255
00:25:53,927 --> 00:25:57,158
- Ms. Walker.
- Captain.

256
00:25:57,364 --> 00:26:00,197
- And this is Inspector...
- Callahan. We've met.

257
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:03,699
Yes, of course. Won't you sit down?

258
00:26:05,772 --> 00:26:06,761
Ms. Walker...

259
00:26:06,973 --> 00:26:11,069
...Lieutenant Ackerman tells me
you have a proposal to make...

260
00:26:11,277 --> 00:26:13,745
...regarding the accidental
damage to...

261
00:26:13,947 --> 00:26:16,609
There was nothing accidental about it.

262
00:26:18,551 --> 00:26:21,418
The department might have something
to say about that.

263
00:26:21,621 --> 00:26:24,089
Although the camera was destroyed...

264
00:26:24,290 --> 00:26:27,157
...I have the entire
incident on video.

265
00:26:28,695 --> 00:26:30,094
I see.

266
00:26:33,333 --> 00:26:34,493
And your proposal?

267
00:26:35,735 --> 00:26:39,364
We may be willing to drop
the lawsuit against the city...

268
00:26:39,572 --> 00:26:42,063
...but that depends
on Inspector Callahan.

269
00:26:44,043 --> 00:26:46,705
I'm sure the inspector
would be willing to...

270
00:26:46,913 --> 00:26:48,403
What do you have in mind?

271
00:26:50,984 --> 00:26:51,973
Dinner.

272
00:27:08,735 --> 00:27:11,101
I owe you an apology.

273
00:27:11,404 --> 00:27:13,838
You were right
about what I did the other day.

274
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:17,532
I had no business intruding
on that girl's grief.

275
00:27:19,446 --> 00:27:21,004
I get too eager sometimes.

276
00:27:21,214 --> 00:27:24,308
In my rush to get the story,
I made an error in judgement.

277
00:27:24,517 --> 00:27:26,348
We all make those sometimes.

278
00:27:26,553 --> 00:27:29,021
No, I should have known better.

279
00:27:29,222 --> 00:27:30,780
I'm sorry.

280
00:27:31,891 --> 00:27:34,451
- Let me ask you, Miss Walker...
- Sam.

281
00:27:34,727 --> 00:27:35,819
Sam.

282
00:27:36,029 --> 00:27:37,053
Do you like cops?

283
00:27:38,131 --> 00:27:40,565
If they're not in my
rear-view mirror. Why?

284
00:27:42,335 --> 00:27:44,599
I wonder what
we're supposed to talk about...

285
00:27:44,804 --> 00:27:47,170
...other than the damaged camera.

286
00:27:47,373 --> 00:27:49,170
Oh, no, no, no.

287
00:27:49,375 --> 00:27:52,640
I'm letting the insurance company
deal with that.

288
00:27:53,780 --> 00:27:57,580
And I think I can be persuaded
to drop the lawsuit...

289
00:27:57,784 --> 00:27:59,684
...but I want something in return.

290
00:28:02,155 --> 00:28:03,247
What would that be?

291
00:28:03,590 --> 00:28:04,818
I want your story.

292
00:28:09,395 --> 00:28:10,225
What's that?

293
00:28:10,430 --> 00:28:12,864
I've done my homework on you.

294
00:28:13,066 --> 00:28:15,500
You've had quite a colorful career.

295
00:28:15,702 --> 00:28:17,397
Loot at this. You see...

296
00:28:17,604 --> 00:28:21,802
...there's a lot of interest right now
in the Janero case...

297
00:28:22,008 --> 00:28:23,873
...and the cop who put him in prison.

298
00:28:24,077 --> 00:28:28,446
Channel 8 is doing a news special
on organized crime in the Bay Area.

299
00:28:28,648 --> 00:28:32,778
But what I would like to do
is an in-depth profile...

300
00:28:32,986 --> 00:28:35,887
...of you, Inspector Harry Callahan.

301
00:28:36,089 --> 00:28:37,681
Sorry, I'm not interested.

302
00:28:37,891 --> 00:28:42,021
Why not? This latest attempt
on your life by one of Janero's men...

303
00:28:42,228 --> 00:28:45,129
You're not interested
in doing a story on me.

304
00:28:45,331 --> 00:28:47,299
You want blood. That's what sells...

305
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:50,367
- Now wait a minute...
- No, you wait a minute.

306
00:28:50,570 --> 00:28:53,130
You people are interested
in death and mayhem...

307
00:28:53,339 --> 00:28:55,569
...and you don't care
how you get the story.

308
00:28:55,775 --> 00:29:00,109
That is not fair. That's not
the kind of journalism I do.

309
00:29:00,313 --> 00:29:02,941
To you I'm just a cop
with a price on his head.

310
00:29:03,149 --> 00:29:07,142
Let me tell you, I don't like
people saying they're gonna kill me.

311
00:29:07,353 --> 00:29:10,880
Nor do I like journalists using it
as a way to increase ratings.

312
00:29:11,090 --> 00:29:14,992
- What I was going to say...
- That's the end of the story.

313
00:29:31,210 --> 00:29:32,302
Sorry.

314
00:29:35,048 --> 00:29:37,346
The coroner's report last night...

315
00:29:37,850 --> 00:29:39,943
...said that Squares used speedballs.

316
00:29:40,153 --> 00:29:41,814
Injecting cocaine and heroin?

317
00:29:42,021 --> 00:29:43,545
But that's not what killed him.

318
00:29:43,756 --> 00:29:46,919
He was using an inhaler
with some new designer drug.

319
00:29:47,126 --> 00:29:49,219
A synthetic form of heroin.

320
00:29:49,429 --> 00:29:52,193
You mean something along the lines
of China White.

321
00:29:52,398 --> 00:29:55,196
Only a thousand times wore powerful.

322
00:29:55,401 --> 00:29:58,632
One snort and he went into
immediate respiratory failure.

323
00:29:58,838 --> 00:30:00,533
IKKnow what I'm trying to figure?

324
00:30:00,740 --> 00:30:02,401
Why is a guy like that...

325
00:30:02,609 --> 00:30:06,409
...screwing with synthetic junk
when he's got the real stuff?

326
00:30:06,613 --> 00:30:08,774
Maybe he didn't know
what he was using.

327
00:30:14,187 --> 00:30:15,347
Harry.

328
00:30:20,326 --> 00:30:21,156
Harry?

329
00:30:23,763 --> 00:30:25,424
Sorry about that.

330
00:30:28,735 --> 00:30:30,362
Get you next time.

331
00:30:36,909 --> 00:30:40,037
Check the cast and crew
for prior drug busts.

332
00:30:40,246 --> 00:30:45,013
I'll check with Narcotics to see if any
dealers are moving synthetic heroin.

333
00:30:45,318 --> 00:30:47,582
Harry, there's something here
you should see.

334
00:30:48,287 --> 00:30:51,256
<i>A story to be published</i>
<i>in today's</i> Tribune...

335
00:30:51,457 --> 00:30:55,587
<i>... reveals that director Peter Swan</i>
<i>and several other people involved...</i>

336
00:30:55,795 --> 00:31:00,664
<i>... in the film</i> Hotel Satan <i>were</i>
<i>playing a game called "The Dead Pool."</i>

337
00:31:00,867 --> 00:31:03,392
<i>According to sources,</i>
<i>the object of the game...</i>

338
00:31:03,603 --> 00:31:06,504
<i>... was for players to pick</i>
<i>eight Bay Area celebrities...</i>

339
00:31:06,706 --> 00:31:10,369
<i>... who might die</i>
<i>by a predetermined date.</i>

340
00:31:10,576 --> 00:31:15,377
<i>The winner was to possess the list</i>
<i>with the most dead celebrities.</i>

341
00:31:15,581 --> 00:31:17,708
<i>What makes this story significant...</i>

342
00:31:17,917 --> 00:31:22,911
<i>... is that rock star Johnny Squares</i>
<i>was on director Peter Swan's list.</i>

343
00:31:23,122 --> 00:31:25,920
<i>Although Swan would not comment...</i>

344
00:31:26,125 --> 00:31:29,458
<i>... we have confirmed that</i>
<i>there was such a game...</i>

345
00:31:29,662 --> 00:31:34,224
<i>... and Swan's production accountant,</i>
<i>Dean Madison, was also involved.</i>

346
00:31:34,467 --> 00:31:37,027
<i>Ironically, Madison was</i>
<i>killed yesterday...</i>

347
00:31:37,236 --> 00:31:40,728
<i>... in a tragic holdup attempt</i>
<i>that took place in Chinatown.</i>

348
00:31:43,810 --> 00:31:48,110
"There is no man who is master of the
breath of life so as to retain it...

349
00:31:48,314 --> 00:31:51,306
...and none has mastery
over the day of death.

350
00:31:51,517 --> 00:31:54,350
For the Lord of all
shows no partiality...

351
00:31:54,554 --> 00:31:56,112
...nor does He fear greatness...

352
00:31:56,322 --> 00:31:58,187
...because He himself
made the great...

353
00:31:58,391 --> 00:31:59,915
...as well as the small.

354
00:32:00,126 --> 00:32:02,924
And He provides for all alike.

355
00:32:03,696 --> 00:32:07,257
And the dust returns to the
earth, as it once was.

356
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:11,295
And the life breath
returns to God, who gaveth."

357
00:32:18,678 --> 00:32:20,407
My condolences.

358
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:23,640
Mrs. Dayton, I'm terribly sorry.

359
00:32:23,883 --> 00:32:26,875
Suzanne, I'm very sorry
for your trouble.

360
00:32:27,086 --> 00:32:28,383
Thank you.

361
00:32:30,189 --> 00:32:31,679
My sympathies, dear.

362
00:32:34,227 --> 00:32:37,856
Do you mind, gentlemen?
I happen to be at a funeral.

363
00:32:38,097 --> 00:32:40,031
I'd like to talk about your list.

364
00:32:40,233 --> 00:32:43,691
It's no big secret.
The cast and crew knew about it.

365
00:32:43,903 --> 00:32:47,100
The Dead Pool is just a harmless game.

366
00:32:47,306 --> 00:32:49,672
It sounds pretty sick to me.

367
00:32:50,243 --> 00:32:51,733
Let me tell you something.

368
00:32:52,111 --> 00:32:55,046
People are fascinated
with death and violence.

369
00:32:55,248 --> 00:32:57,148
That's why my films make money.

370
00:32:57,350 --> 00:33:00,649
They're an escape,
a vicarious release of fear.

371
00:33:00,853 --> 00:33:02,684
Same thing with this game.

372
00:33:02,889 --> 00:33:05,585
Nobody takes my films
or the Dead Pool seriously.

373
00:33:06,292 --> 00:33:09,819
Someone gave Squares the drugs
that killed him. Maybe you.

374
00:33:10,029 --> 00:33:13,487
You can't tie me to Johnny's death
because of a coincidence.

375
00:33:14,934 --> 00:33:19,200
My assistant and effects supervisor
played too. Why not talk to them?

376
00:33:19,405 --> 00:33:20,372
We will.

377
00:33:21,340 --> 00:33:23,433
But nobody on their list is dead yet.

378
00:33:23,643 --> 00:33:28,137
Johnny was a drug user and I predicted
he'd die this year. That's all.

379
00:33:28,347 --> 00:33:31,441
The idea is to pick celebrities
who won't make it...

380
00:33:31,651 --> 00:33:34,677
...because they're old, sick
or in a high-risk profession.

381
00:33:34,887 --> 00:33:36,377
Like police work?

382
00:33:36,856 --> 00:33:37,823
Nothing personal.

383
00:33:38,024 --> 00:33:40,584
I don't like being on your list, Swan.

384
00:33:40,793 --> 00:33:43,523
That's what this is really about,
isn't it?

385
00:33:43,729 --> 00:33:44,889
If you have a choice...

386
00:33:45,097 --> 00:33:47,793
Maybe I'll start my own Pool
and put you on it.

387
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,433
Are you threatening me?

388
00:33:50,069 --> 00:33:54,472
If you want to play the game,
you'd better know the rules, love.

389
00:34:13,259 --> 00:34:15,386
That's our report. I'm Patrick Snow.

390
00:34:15,595 --> 00:34:18,462
I'm Samantha Walker.
Thank you for being with us.

391
00:34:18,664 --> 00:34:20,632
Tune in tonight
for an exclusive report...

392
00:34:20,833 --> 00:34:23,233
...on chemical dependency
among celebrities.

393
00:34:23,436 --> 00:34:25,063
Who they are, why they do it...

394
00:34:25,271 --> 00:34:27,899
...and the price they pay.
Tonight at 11.

395
00:34:28,107 --> 00:34:29,404
Good night.

396
00:34:30,343 --> 00:34:31,970
And we're clear.

397
00:34:50,796 --> 00:34:53,060
Thought I'd seen the last of you.

398
00:34:53,266 --> 00:34:54,790
I saw your report yesterday.

399
00:34:55,001 --> 00:34:57,128
We confirmed it
with people in the game.

400
00:34:57,336 --> 00:35:02,103
Vicky Owens, Swan's assistant,
and effects supervisor, Jeff Howser.

401
00:35:02,441 --> 00:35:05,274
It didn't occur to you
to clear it with us first?

402
00:35:05,478 --> 00:35:07,036
I had to go with the story.

403
00:35:07,246 --> 00:35:10,773
The papers got the same tip.
I had to get the story out fast.

404
00:35:10,983 --> 00:35:13,178
Or someone else would get it first?

405
00:35:13,386 --> 00:35:15,616
- Something like that.
- How were you tipped?

406
00:35:15,821 --> 00:35:19,780
By mail. A copy of the Dead Pool
and a letter explaining it.

407
00:35:22,361 --> 00:35:24,693
- It's already started.
- What has?

408
00:35:24,897 --> 00:35:26,922
All the media bullshit.

409
00:35:27,166 --> 00:35:31,193
Newspapers print the Dead Pool
and it hurts our investigation.

410
00:35:31,404 --> 00:35:32,962
What bothers you...

411
00:35:33,172 --> 00:35:35,902
...is that we found out about
the Dead Pool first.

412
00:35:36,108 --> 00:35:40,477
You people take Janero and the Dead
Pool, add hype and distortion...

413
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:42,307
...and innocent people get hurt.

414
00:35:42,515 --> 00:35:44,483
Aren't you overreacting?

415
00:35:44,684 --> 00:35:46,117
I've seen it happen.

416
00:35:46,319 --> 00:35:49,152
I don't like the hype, either...

417
00:35:49,355 --> 00:35:51,687
...but it happens when reporters
compete for a story.

418
00:35:52,058 --> 00:35:56,051
Why don't you start thinking about
your responsibility to the public?

419
00:35:57,563 --> 00:36:00,498
You can't kill the messenger
because of the message.

420
00:36:02,068 --> 00:36:06,402
I'm sorry, it wasn't my intention
to screw up your investigation.

421
00:36:07,306 --> 00:36:09,570
Here's the list. Now, excuse me.

422
00:36:12,111 --> 00:36:13,305
Thanks.

423
00:36:17,083 --> 00:36:18,607
It seems I owe you one.

424
00:36:21,620 --> 00:36:23,110
Dinner, that is.

425
00:36:26,292 --> 00:36:31,059
I was offered a job as an anchor
at this small, local station.

426
00:36:31,263 --> 00:36:32,696
Because...

427
00:36:32,965 --> 00:36:36,162
...I was first runner-up
in Miss Colorado.

428
00:36:36,369 --> 00:36:38,963
Colorado? We're right over here.

429
00:36:39,171 --> 00:36:43,574
But I had absolutely no experience,
just my bachelor's in journalism.

430
00:36:43,776 --> 00:36:47,644
But it was a way in, so I grabbed it.

431
00:36:50,783 --> 00:36:53,752
But I didn't just smile at
the camera and read copy.

432
00:36:53,953 --> 00:36:56,581
I did anything and everything
at this station.

433
00:36:56,789 --> 00:37:00,850
Sports, news, hard news, weather.

434
00:37:01,060 --> 00:37:02,994
I produced documentaries.

435
00:37:04,830 --> 00:37:06,764
I love San Francisco.

436
00:37:06,966 --> 00:37:08,593
But it isn't easy.

437
00:37:09,969 --> 00:37:12,130
Big city, big news.

438
00:37:13,039 --> 00:37:15,405
I had to prove myself all over again.

439
00:37:15,608 --> 00:37:17,269
Have you succeeded?

440
00:37:17,643 --> 00:37:18,871
Somewhat.

441
00:37:20,212 --> 00:37:21,645
Apparently not with you.

442
00:37:22,915 --> 00:37:27,284
I shouldn't complain. At least you
stayed for dinner this time.

443
00:37:29,088 --> 00:37:31,249
I'd still love to do your story.

444
00:37:31,824 --> 00:37:33,086
No, thanks.

445
00:37:33,359 --> 00:37:36,658
You're wrong about me, Callahan,
and what I want to do.

446
00:37:37,430 --> 00:37:39,364
I wish I could convince you.

447
00:37:39,799 --> 00:37:41,198
I'll tell you what.

448
00:37:41,801 --> 00:37:43,428
Let's think on it.

449
00:37:44,537 --> 00:37:45,435
Sounds fair.

450
00:37:48,174 --> 00:37:49,402
Thank you.

451
00:38:04,023 --> 00:38:07,288
It's the truth,
I don't care what you say.

452
00:38:14,266 --> 00:38:15,893
Hey, Callahan.

453
00:38:16,268 --> 00:38:18,828
- You're Callahan, aren't you?
- That's right.

454
00:38:19,038 --> 00:38:20,130
What can I do for you?

455
00:38:20,339 --> 00:38:22,739
You're the cop who put Janero away.

456
00:38:25,778 --> 00:38:28,338
All I want is your autograph.

457
00:38:30,116 --> 00:38:31,947
Can I shake your hand?

458
00:38:35,554 --> 00:38:37,021
I'd just like to thank you.

459
00:38:37,223 --> 00:38:40,522
It's about time somebody
did something about Janero.

460
00:38:40,726 --> 00:38:44,492
Could you sign it to
Chester Docksteder? That's me.

461
00:38:45,598 --> 00:38:46,997
Let me buy you a drink.

462
00:38:47,199 --> 00:38:48,666
Some other time.

463
00:38:49,268 --> 00:38:52,931
We need more cops like you.
That's what we need.

464
00:38:53,539 --> 00:38:55,700
I gotta change my shorts.

465
00:38:59,445 --> 00:39:01,174
What are you laughing at?

466
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:04,110
This is your 15 minutes, Callahan.

467
00:39:04,650 --> 00:39:09,110
Andy Warhol said everybody's famous
for 15 minutes. Well, this is it.

468
00:39:09,321 --> 00:39:10,345
Swell.

469
00:39:26,205 --> 00:39:27,729
Was it your first autograph?

470
00:39:27,940 --> 00:39:29,100
Yeah.

471
00:39:29,375 --> 00:39:31,536
And I hope my last.

472
00:40:58,330 --> 00:41:00,059
You know something?

473
00:41:00,332 --> 00:41:03,267
I don't think Lou Janero
likes you very much.

474
00:41:15,180 --> 00:41:17,910
She's okay. Just a little shaken up.

475
00:41:24,089 --> 00:41:25,750
How're you doing, girl?

476
00:41:29,461 --> 00:41:33,227
Whatever they're paying you, Harry,
it couldn't be enough.

477
00:41:37,803 --> 00:41:39,327
My colleagues.

478
00:41:44,443 --> 00:41:46,343
I don't want to be the news.

479
00:41:48,013 --> 00:41:49,605
Let's get you out of here.

480
00:42:22,748 --> 00:42:24,716
You sure you want to see this guy?

481
00:42:24,917 --> 00:42:26,179
Yeah.

482
00:42:36,962 --> 00:42:38,259
Here's your animal.

483
00:42:38,797 --> 00:42:39,627
Hicks.

484
00:42:39,832 --> 00:42:41,459
What the fuck do you want?

485
00:42:41,667 --> 00:42:43,726
I brought you some cigarettes.

486
00:42:44,336 --> 00:42:46,566
And what would I have to do for you?

487
00:42:46,839 --> 00:42:49,808
Nothing. Just stand where I tell you.

488
00:43:16,368 --> 00:43:17,699
Stay right here.

489
00:43:17,903 --> 00:43:19,370
Fifth cell down.

490
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:32,473
That's the trouble with this prison.
They let anybody in.

491
00:43:32,918 --> 00:43:35,978
I don't like scum like you
trying to kill me.

492
00:43:37,256 --> 00:43:42,091
Sounds to me like this Dead Pool thing
is making you a little paranoid.

493
00:43:43,662 --> 00:43:46,358
Oh, yeah. I heard about it.

494
00:43:46,598 --> 00:43:49,260
Good news travels fast.

495
00:43:49,468 --> 00:43:51,834
Big fucking media hero.

496
00:43:52,037 --> 00:43:54,562
Hero today and gone tomorrow.

497
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:56,808
Call off your guns.

498
00:43:57,042 --> 00:43:58,703
What are you talking about?

499
00:43:58,911 --> 00:44:02,938
Your trouble is, you have
too much time on your hands.

500
00:44:03,148 --> 00:44:04,638
What you need is a job.

501
00:44:04,850 --> 00:44:05,680
A what?

502
00:44:05,884 --> 00:44:07,181
A job.

503
00:44:07,686 --> 00:44:11,019
I'm gonna give you a job
being a postman, understand?

504
00:44:11,223 --> 00:44:13,885
It'll be your job to see
the mail gets through.

505
00:44:14,927 --> 00:44:17,054
See that gorilla down there?

506
00:44:25,737 --> 00:44:29,867
That's Butcher Hicks, and he's killed
three men. You know how?

507
00:44:30,075 --> 00:44:33,533
He tore them apart with his teeth.
Never found all the pieces.

508
00:44:33,745 --> 00:44:36,009
He has an unhealthy appetite.

509
00:44:36,215 --> 00:44:37,409
So what?

510
00:44:37,616 --> 00:44:40,210
So Hicks there is my new pen pal.

511
00:44:40,419 --> 00:44:42,478
I'll write him once a week...

512
00:44:42,688 --> 00:44:45,555
...about how I'm looking in
on his sick mother...

513
00:44:45,757 --> 00:44:48,749
...and trying to get him
special privileges here.

514
00:44:49,094 --> 00:44:53,724
And the interesting part is,
if anything happens to me...

515
00:44:53,932 --> 00:44:55,661
...and Hicks doesn't get his letter...

516
00:44:55,868 --> 00:44:58,928
...he'll be really pissed off.
And he'll come to see you...

517
00:44:59,137 --> 00:45:00,434
...because you're the mailman.

518
00:45:02,040 --> 00:45:06,943
He'll probably come down here
and cancel your ass like a stamp.

519
00:45:09,648 --> 00:45:12,583
You better ensure prompt,
courteous delivery.

520
00:45:12,784 --> 00:45:15,810
And pray nothing happens to me.

521
00:45:20,559 --> 00:45:22,288
- That's it?
- That's it.

522
00:45:22,494 --> 00:45:25,622
See that dirtbag
I was talking to down there?

523
00:45:28,233 --> 00:45:30,258
He says smoking can cause cancer...

524
00:45:30,469 --> 00:45:34,838
...and anyone who smokes as much
as you do is one dumb son of a bitch.

525
00:45:54,560 --> 00:45:56,357
Fire!

526
00:45:58,163 --> 00:45:59,061
Cut!

527
00:45:59,264 --> 00:46:01,698
Cut! Cut.

528
00:46:03,368 --> 00:46:05,768
Where is that stupid fuck? Hauser!

529
00:46:06,939 --> 00:46:08,804
Get your ass down here.

530
00:46:11,176 --> 00:46:14,509
You're supposed to harpoon
the goddamn dummy.

531
00:46:15,781 --> 00:46:16,907
The tide shifted.

532
00:46:17,115 --> 00:46:20,710
"The tide shifted."
The ocean's incompetent, not you.

533
00:46:20,919 --> 00:46:23,046
This is the third time this week.

534
00:46:23,255 --> 00:46:25,246
You'll never work for me again.

535
00:46:25,457 --> 00:46:27,891
There's a bunch
of reporters down there.

536
00:46:30,862 --> 00:46:32,386
Come on, come on.

537
00:46:37,803 --> 00:46:39,498
Can we ask you a few questions?

538
00:46:39,705 --> 00:46:41,036
Please!

539
00:46:41,239 --> 00:46:43,070
I'd like to say one thing.

540
00:46:43,275 --> 00:46:45,175
In light of what's happened...

541
00:46:45,377 --> 00:46:48,175
...perhaps playing the Dead Pool game
isn't smart.

542
00:46:48,380 --> 00:46:51,144
Any tie between the Dead Pool
and Squares' death?

543
00:46:51,350 --> 00:46:53,750
None whatsoever. Next question.

544
00:46:53,952 --> 00:46:56,011
Mr. Swan, will the game continue?

545
00:46:56,221 --> 00:46:59,918
No, we're filming a nightmare
sequence at the shipyards...

546
00:47:00,125 --> 00:47:03,288
...and we'd like to forget this
and get on with our job.

547
00:47:03,595 --> 00:47:05,563
Johnny would have wanted it that way.

548
00:47:05,764 --> 00:47:10,633
First Squares died, then your
production accountant was killed.

549
00:47:10,836 --> 00:47:12,599
Is <i>Hotel Satan</i> cursed?

550
00:47:12,804 --> 00:47:15,967
People can believe what they want,
but nothing...

551
00:47:17,843 --> 00:47:20,744
Nothing will stop me
from making this film.

552
00:47:22,848 --> 00:47:24,281
End of interview.

553
00:48:08,593 --> 00:48:12,359
Whatever you want,
money, credit cards, just take it.

554
00:48:12,564 --> 00:48:15,590
Ever notice how time
slows down at night?

555
00:48:15,801 --> 00:48:19,464
Just like in my films. A dream world.

556
00:48:19,671 --> 00:48:20,797
Shut up!

557
00:48:21,540 --> 00:48:23,974
I can't hear the colors.
I've got to hear them.

558
00:48:24,543 --> 00:48:28,946
That's the mark of a good director,
you have to hear the colors.

559
00:48:29,147 --> 00:48:32,082
You've gotta be able
to taste the sounds.

560
00:48:32,284 --> 00:48:33,649
I have a heart condition.

561
00:48:33,852 --> 00:48:35,683
A critic with a heart.

562
00:48:35,987 --> 00:48:37,249
That's a laugh.

563
00:48:39,324 --> 00:48:40,916
Do you like my films?

564
00:48:41,126 --> 00:48:44,823
- I said, do you like my films?
- Who are you?

565
00:48:50,068 --> 00:48:53,435
- You know who I am.
- I don't. I don't know you.

566
00:48:53,638 --> 00:48:54,935
God...

567
00:48:55,340 --> 00:48:58,309
...what kind of a film critic are you?

568
00:48:59,177 --> 00:49:01,042
<i>Shadows of the Dead</i>!

569
00:49:02,748 --> 00:49:04,477
<i>Hell Without the Devil</i>!

570
00:49:04,716 --> 00:49:06,741
<i>Night of the Slasher</i>!

571
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:10,550
Peter Swan.

572
00:49:11,957 --> 00:49:13,447
Brilliant, love.

573
00:49:14,626 --> 00:49:16,617
What do you think of my films?

574
00:49:17,195 --> 00:49:20,631
Give me your honest opinion.

575
00:49:21,767 --> 00:49:23,667
I like them.

576
00:49:23,869 --> 00:49:24,995
Liar!

577
00:49:34,246 --> 00:49:37,010
The entrance is probably
through the sliding glass door.

578
00:49:37,215 --> 00:49:39,240
She wasn't sexually assaulted.

579
00:49:39,451 --> 00:49:41,009
IKKilled sometime last night.

580
00:49:41,219 --> 00:49:44,245
Maid found her this morning.
Do you recognize her?

581
00:49:44,790 --> 00:49:47,350
Molly Fisher. Famous movie critic.

582
00:49:47,559 --> 00:49:50,027
On a scale of 1 to 10,
10 being the best...

583
00:49:50,228 --> 00:49:52,492
...I'd have to rate this one an 8.

584
00:49:52,697 --> 00:49:54,665
Harry, we found this.

585
00:49:55,400 --> 00:49:56,628
Thanks.

586
00:49:58,503 --> 00:49:59,663
Dead Pool.

587
00:49:59,938 --> 00:50:02,736
Molly Fisher's also
on Peter Swan's list.

588
00:50:40,245 --> 00:50:42,076
<i>Oh, God, it's coming!</i>

589
00:50:43,949 --> 00:50:48,249
Those are just some of the highlights
of Peter Swan's films.

590
00:50:49,354 --> 00:50:53,484
The typeface is the same as those sent
to the papers and TV stations.

591
00:50:53,692 --> 00:50:58,186
And the neighbor saw a man exiting
Molly Fisher's condo last night.

592
00:50:58,396 --> 00:51:00,921
Mid-30s, wearing a black jacket.

593
00:51:01,199 --> 00:51:03,064
I want Swan in custody now.

594
00:51:03,268 --> 00:51:04,667
It doesn't feel right.

595
00:51:04,870 --> 00:51:06,064
Doesn't feel right?

596
00:51:06,571 --> 00:51:10,098
Every celebrity on this list has
called in the last couple days.

597
00:51:10,308 --> 00:51:12,868
They're all screaming
for police protection.

598
00:51:13,078 --> 00:51:17,139
We don't have the manpower
to be 24-hour babysitters.

599
00:51:17,349 --> 00:51:22,309
Ackerman is whining about the negative
publicity this case is giving us.

600
00:51:22,520 --> 00:51:25,648
And your name
is on this list too, Callahan.

601
00:51:27,359 --> 00:51:31,090
My gut feeling tells me Swan is the
best suspect we have...

602
00:51:31,296 --> 00:51:32,854
...so get his butt in here!

603
00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:36,360
Donnelly.

604
00:51:36,668 --> 00:51:37,692
What?

605
00:51:39,404 --> 00:51:41,838
It's for you, Callahan.

606
00:51:47,078 --> 00:51:48,841
We'll be right there.

607
00:51:49,214 --> 00:51:51,842
Wait a minute. Where are you going?

608
00:51:52,117 --> 00:51:55,109
To do my job.
I think we've got our man.

609
00:51:57,622 --> 00:51:59,249
You all stay back.

610
00:52:00,125 --> 00:52:01,387
Everyone.

611
00:52:02,093 --> 00:52:03,185
I'm gonna go up.

612
00:52:04,529 --> 00:52:06,497
Where's the news crew?

613
00:52:08,566 --> 00:52:10,591
You better get them here.

614
00:52:12,237 --> 00:52:13,727
I mean it. Now!

615
00:52:19,878 --> 00:52:20,708
What's up?

616
00:52:20,912 --> 00:52:25,178
Name's Gus Wheeler.
He says he's the Dead Pool killer.

617
00:52:25,383 --> 00:52:27,044
We found him like this.

618
00:52:27,252 --> 00:52:31,154
He's soaked in gas and threatening
to set himself on fire.

619
00:52:31,356 --> 00:52:32,789
Why not hose him down?

620
00:52:32,991 --> 00:52:37,155
He says if he sees a fireman or even
a garden hose, he'll torch himself.

621
00:52:37,963 --> 00:52:38,827
What's he want?

622
00:52:39,030 --> 00:52:40,691
To be on television.

623
00:52:41,032 --> 00:52:43,626
He wants a cameraman and a reporter.

624
00:52:43,835 --> 00:52:45,462
Al and I will just pose as...

625
00:52:45,670 --> 00:52:48,503
It has to be someone he recognizes.

626
00:53:00,385 --> 00:53:02,910
Stay back. Stay back from me.

627
00:53:03,788 --> 00:53:05,585
It's gonna go up. You hear me?

628
00:53:06,224 --> 00:53:08,089
Better keep those people back.

629
00:53:09,661 --> 00:53:11,595
- You all right?
- Not really.

630
00:53:11,796 --> 00:53:14,560
Stop right there! That's far enough.

631
00:53:15,467 --> 00:53:17,628
I'm Samantha Walker from...

632
00:53:17,836 --> 00:53:20,532
- I know who you are!
- What do you want?

633
00:53:22,607 --> 00:53:23,699
Is that camera on?

634
00:53:26,378 --> 00:53:28,608
You want to know why I'm doing this?

635
00:53:30,782 --> 00:53:32,374
Because nobody cares.

636
00:53:32,584 --> 00:53:33,573
We care, Mr. Wheeler...

637
00:53:33,785 --> 00:53:36,948
No! Nobody ever paid
any attention to me before.

638
00:53:37,222 --> 00:53:40,658
In order to get attention,
you gotta do something.

639
00:53:41,926 --> 00:53:45,794
Well, I'm really gonna
do something this time!

640
00:53:46,264 --> 00:53:49,324
Did you have anything
to do with the deaths...

641
00:53:49,534 --> 00:53:51,729
...of Johnny Squares and Molly Fisher?

642
00:53:51,936 --> 00:53:54,496
No, I just said that so you'd listen!

643
00:53:57,308 --> 00:53:59,799
I want everyone to see this!

644
00:54:00,345 --> 00:54:02,745
I want everyone to remember me!

645
00:54:03,014 --> 00:54:05,608
And to remember what I did here!

646
00:54:12,724 --> 00:54:16,285
Oh, Jesus, Harry, he's
really gonna do it.

647
00:54:16,494 --> 00:54:20,863
That's right, lady. I'm really
gonna set myself on fire.

648
00:54:21,599 --> 00:54:23,863
And it's gonna be on the news...

649
00:54:24,269 --> 00:54:27,727
...and then finally everybody
will know about me.

650
00:54:27,939 --> 00:54:30,373
About me! Gus Wheeler!

651
00:54:32,977 --> 00:54:35,138
No one's going to see you die.

652
00:54:37,582 --> 00:54:38,412
What?

653
00:54:38,616 --> 00:54:41,346
I said, no one's gonna see you die.

654
00:54:41,719 --> 00:54:43,653
Not if we stop filming.

655
00:54:47,525 --> 00:54:50,221
You can talk to me
and tell me your story...

656
00:54:50,428 --> 00:54:52,328
...but we won't film your suicide.

657
00:54:58,937 --> 00:54:59,767
What are you doing?

658
00:55:00,038 --> 00:55:02,836
- Turn the camera back on!
- We're not gonna film it!

659
00:55:03,041 --> 00:55:05,475
- We're not.
- She's right.

660
00:55:05,677 --> 00:55:09,636
You can set yourself on fire
and we'll roast marshmallows.

661
00:55:09,848 --> 00:55:11,713
But you won't be on <i>News at 11.</i>

662
00:55:12,584 --> 00:55:14,643
You're ruining everything.

663
00:55:15,386 --> 00:55:16,751
Give me the flare.

664
00:55:16,988 --> 00:55:18,717
You've got plenty of coverage.

665
00:55:21,926 --> 00:55:22,984
You think so?

666
00:55:23,661 --> 00:55:24,650
Trust me.

667
00:55:33,404 --> 00:55:34,393
Okay.

668
00:55:50,455 --> 00:55:51,854
Harry, you okay?

669
00:55:53,558 --> 00:55:55,492
- You hurt?
- No, I'm fine.

670
00:55:59,964 --> 00:56:01,864
Get that gurney over here, quick!

671
00:56:04,936 --> 00:56:05,766
You all right?

672
00:56:05,970 --> 00:56:08,336
Oh, God, Harry.

673
00:56:09,407 --> 00:56:12,740
This man sets himself on fire.

674
00:56:17,549 --> 00:56:18,573
And it's my fault.

675
00:56:18,783 --> 00:56:20,546
It was an accident.

676
00:56:22,820 --> 00:56:24,549
Maybe if we'd have kept filming.

677
00:56:24,756 --> 00:56:26,883
That's exactly what he wanted.

678
00:56:27,926 --> 00:56:32,693
What you did took guts. Most people
would have gone for the exclusive.

679
00:56:38,903 --> 00:56:40,700
Reel three, George.

680
00:56:44,209 --> 00:56:45,642
Just a moment.

681
00:56:46,110 --> 00:56:49,546
What is this? Why the fuck
are you harassing me?

682
00:56:49,747 --> 00:56:51,874
I was at a party when
Fisher was killed.

683
00:56:52,083 --> 00:56:55,109
I was there until 2,
and I have witnesses.

684
00:56:55,320 --> 00:56:56,810
We know that. We checked.

685
00:56:57,021 --> 00:57:02,220
Somebody's trying to make us think
that you killed Squares and Fisher.

686
00:57:04,162 --> 00:57:05,561
Any idea who it is?

687
00:57:05,763 --> 00:57:08,163
Are you kidding? It could be anyone.

688
00:57:08,766 --> 00:57:09,790
They all hate me.

689
00:57:10,001 --> 00:57:11,093
My former agent.

690
00:57:11,302 --> 00:57:14,635
My producers, my crew. The public.

691
00:57:14,839 --> 00:57:19,208
They envy my talent so much
they wish to destroy it.

692
00:57:21,779 --> 00:57:24,646
You don't believe me?
Talk to my secretary.

693
00:57:24,849 --> 00:57:28,910
She'll show you the letters I get.
Warnings, death threats...

694
00:57:29,120 --> 00:57:32,214
I get so many,
I don't pay attention anymore.

695
00:57:32,724 --> 00:57:34,214
I'll check on it.

696
00:57:34,892 --> 00:57:36,359
Tell me...

697
00:57:36,828 --> 00:57:39,797
...anyone else have
a jacket like this?

698
00:57:39,998 --> 00:57:41,192
Most of my crew. Why?

699
00:57:41,399 --> 00:57:45,859
Maybe it was someone in your crew,
or who's worked for you in the past.

700
00:57:46,070 --> 00:57:50,564
Whoever's doing these murders uses
your films and you as inspiration.

701
00:57:52,844 --> 00:57:56,644
<i>Welcome to the</i> Nolan IKKennard Show.
<i>Sex, violence, pornography:</i>

702
00:57:56,848 --> 00:58:01,217
<i>I say it's out of hand. It's time</i>
<i>we have guidelines for what we watch.</i>

703
00:58:02,920 --> 00:58:07,186
<i>I don't want Big Brother out there</i>
<i>telling me what to read or watch.</i>

704
00:58:10,428 --> 00:58:11,395
<i>What's your opinion?</i>

705
00:58:11,596 --> 00:58:14,224
<i>Anybody can watch anything...</i>

706
00:58:14,432 --> 00:58:17,265
<i>... as long as it doesn't</i>
<i>hurt somebody else.</i>

707
00:58:19,570 --> 00:58:21,265
<i>Take it easy.</i>

708
00:58:21,472 --> 00:58:23,406
<i>Give me a chance here.</i>

709
00:58:23,608 --> 00:58:26,042
<i>Who decides what's harmful?</i>

710
00:58:26,244 --> 00:58:28,508
<i>Isn't that what we're talking about?</i>

711
00:59:56,033 --> 01:00:00,094
First Johnny Squares, then Molly
Fisher, now Nolan IKKennard.

712
01:00:00,304 --> 01:00:04,798
- Like I said, celebrities always die...
- In threes, yeah.

713
01:00:06,043 --> 01:00:09,535
- At least the guy went out with a...
- A bang, I know.

714
01:00:12,083 --> 01:00:14,813
- What do you have, Russ?
- Hello, Harry.

715
01:00:15,019 --> 01:00:19,820
From the residue on the frags,
I'd say plastic. Probably C3 or 4.

716
01:00:20,024 --> 01:00:22,083
We'll do an analysis back at the lab.

717
01:00:22,293 --> 01:00:24,818
- Let me know the results.
- You got it.

718
01:00:31,436 --> 01:00:32,903
What's that?

719
01:00:33,104 --> 01:00:34,628
I don't know.

720
01:00:35,072 --> 01:00:37,768
It looks like the wheel from a toy.

721
01:00:45,316 --> 01:00:47,716
Have you been questioned about
Nolan IKKennard?

722
01:00:47,919 --> 01:00:50,285
Is his death connected
to the Dead Pool?

723
01:00:50,488 --> 01:00:52,649
- I don't know.
- Is his death due to your list?

724
01:00:52,857 --> 01:00:54,916
- I don't know.
- In <i>Hell Without the Devil...</i>

725
01:00:55,126 --> 01:00:56,218
...a character's poisoned.

726
01:00:56,427 --> 01:00:59,123
<i>Night of the Slasher</i>
has several stabbings.

727
01:00:59,330 --> 01:01:02,128
- We can guess what <i>Hotel Satan</i>...
- Get to the point.

728
01:01:02,333 --> 01:01:05,632
Are there parallels between the deaths
in your film...

729
01:01:05,837 --> 01:01:07,702
...and the death of Johnny Squares?

730
01:01:07,905 --> 01:01:09,873
That's a stupid question!

731
01:01:10,074 --> 01:01:12,008
Do you feel any responsibility?

732
01:01:12,210 --> 01:01:14,804
You people are
blowing this out of proportion.

733
01:01:15,012 --> 01:01:18,345
<i>You want to speak to somebody?</i>
<i>Speak to the police.</i>

734
01:01:18,549 --> 01:01:22,713
<i>Talk to Inspector Callahan.</i>
<i>He'll tell you I'm not a suspect.</i>

735
01:01:22,920 --> 01:01:25,047
<i>I have nothing</i>
<i>to do with these deaths.</i>

736
01:01:25,256 --> 01:01:27,622
<i>That's all I have to say, now sod off.</i>

737
01:01:28,025 --> 01:01:29,686
Callahan!

738
01:02:06,297 --> 01:02:07,764
You.

739
01:02:42,333 --> 01:02:43,459
Harry.

740
01:02:46,237 --> 01:02:48,432
I think that's about it for me.

741
01:02:52,343 --> 01:02:53,605
What's that tattoo?

742
01:02:54,278 --> 01:02:55,905
Oh, that.

743
01:02:56,113 --> 01:02:58,411
One of my grandfather's superstitions.

744
01:02:58,616 --> 01:03:02,279
You see, he painted these words
on my back and chest.

745
01:03:02,486 --> 01:03:06,115
It's supposed to ward off
anything that's harmful or evil.

746
01:03:06,324 --> 01:03:10,658
When he heard I was your partner,
he figured I could use the help.

747
01:03:10,861 --> 01:03:13,091
I was just trying
to honor the old guy.

748
01:03:13,831 --> 01:03:16,629
Besides, I didn't think it could hurt.

749
01:03:17,368 --> 01:03:19,836
Listen, I think I'm gonna go home.

750
01:03:20,037 --> 01:03:22,403
I'll catch you later for a beer.

751
01:03:59,176 --> 01:04:01,076
- See him?
- I saw him.

752
01:04:39,717 --> 01:04:41,275
He can't be over there.

753
01:04:41,852 --> 01:04:43,376
How y'all doing?

754
01:04:59,637 --> 01:05:01,730
You're the last asshole Janero sends.

755
01:05:01,939 --> 01:05:03,270
Wait, you got it wrong!

756
01:05:03,474 --> 01:05:06,807
Don't fuck with me, buddy.
I'll kick your ass right now.

757
01:05:07,011 --> 01:05:08,239
It's not what you think.

758
01:05:08,446 --> 01:05:10,414
Janero did hire us.

759
01:05:10,614 --> 01:05:12,479
But this ain't a hit.

760
01:05:12,683 --> 01:05:16,346
Janero doesn't want
anything to happen to you.

761
01:05:16,554 --> 01:05:17,486
We're your...

762
01:05:18,389 --> 01:05:19,481
...bodyguards.

763
01:05:30,301 --> 01:05:33,065
Those letters
all came from your files.

764
01:05:33,471 --> 01:05:35,996
Harlan Rook. God.

765
01:05:36,207 --> 01:05:37,572
Yes, I remember him.

766
01:05:37,775 --> 01:05:42,269
Every time I was at a film festival
or a seminar, he was there.

767
01:05:42,480 --> 01:05:46,712
Mr. IKKnow-It-AII, I called him.
He knew everything about my films.

768
01:05:48,219 --> 01:05:51,655
To tell the truth,
I found it a little unnerving.

769
01:05:52,523 --> 01:05:54,013
What'd he want?

770
01:05:54,825 --> 01:05:56,122
He had this screenplay...

771
01:05:56,327 --> 01:05:58,522
...for a horror film
he wanted me to direct.

772
01:05:58,729 --> 01:06:01,425
He said it'd be
the ultimate Peter Swan film.

773
01:06:01,632 --> 01:06:03,600
He was crazy.
I couldn't get rid of him.

774
01:06:03,801 --> 01:06:07,293
Finally, my attorney
put a restraining order on him.

775
01:06:07,505 --> 01:06:08,699
Then what happened?

776
01:06:08,906 --> 01:06:10,999
I didn't see or hear from him again.

777
01:06:11,208 --> 01:06:14,075
That must have been over a year ago.

778
01:06:15,513 --> 01:06:16,480
Is he the one?

779
01:06:16,680 --> 01:06:18,910
The typewriter
used on these letters...

780
01:06:19,116 --> 01:06:22,643
...is the same one used
to tip us off to the Dead Pool.

781
01:06:27,258 --> 01:06:30,557
Call Swan's attorney
and see what he knows about Rook.

782
01:06:30,761 --> 01:06:32,558
And run a DMV check.

783
01:06:32,763 --> 01:06:33,889
Right.

784
01:07:01,692 --> 01:07:05,958
It might not be a bad idea to start
playing it a little safe.

785
01:07:06,163 --> 01:07:08,358
Maybe your granddaddy can paint me up.

786
01:07:08,566 --> 01:07:10,431
Look, I'm being serious.

787
01:07:10,634 --> 01:07:14,570
Don't go where you normally go,
not even home. You can stay with me.

788
01:07:15,039 --> 01:07:18,202
Thanks, but I think I can
do a little better.

789
01:07:29,086 --> 01:07:30,610
Price of fame.

790
01:08:00,851 --> 01:08:04,378
Is this what Ackerman meant
by cooperating with the press?

791
01:08:04,588 --> 01:08:07,989
It must have been one of those
in-depth interviews.

792
01:08:18,903 --> 01:08:22,066
I got a lead on Rook.
A psychiatrist who treated him.

793
01:08:22,273 --> 01:08:23,501
Good.

794
01:08:26,577 --> 01:08:27,669
- Give it a try.
- Okay.

795
01:08:33,050 --> 01:08:36,110
It won't respond.
Someone's on my frequency.

796
01:08:49,266 --> 01:08:51,826
Forget it. It's just not working.

797
01:09:22,333 --> 01:09:24,198
Now what the hell is that?

798
01:12:43,167 --> 01:12:45,226
Time's up, Callahan.

799
01:13:22,673 --> 01:13:24,231
You all right, Al?

800
01:13:24,608 --> 01:13:26,132
Shit.

801
01:13:39,189 --> 01:13:40,781
Two fractured ribs.

802
01:13:41,325 --> 01:13:44,317
He bled in the chest.
We drained it and set up an IV.

803
01:13:44,528 --> 01:13:48,294
He's lucky, the bulletproof vest
he had on saved his life.

804
01:13:49,166 --> 01:13:51,760
Another of my
grandfather's superstitions.

805
01:13:51,969 --> 01:13:54,028
When your partner gives you advice...

806
01:13:54,238 --> 01:13:55,205
...take it.

807
01:13:56,440 --> 01:13:57,907
Harry.

808
01:14:06,483 --> 01:14:10,317
This is Dr. Friedman, chief
psychiatrist here at the hospital.

809
01:14:10,520 --> 01:14:12,181
I'm sorry about what happened.

810
01:14:12,389 --> 01:14:14,186
I feel somewhat responsible.

811
01:14:14,391 --> 01:14:17,519
Your partner contacted me about
a former patient of ours.

812
01:14:17,728 --> 01:14:19,252
- Harlan Rook?
- Yes.

813
01:14:19,463 --> 01:14:23,126
At first, I didn't recall the name.
I found the file today.

814
01:14:23,900 --> 01:14:25,993
He was evaluated here a year ago.

815
01:14:26,203 --> 01:14:28,671
The diagnosis was
process schizophrenia.

816
01:14:28,872 --> 01:14:30,305
Multiple personality.

817
01:14:30,507 --> 01:14:31,337
Exactly.

818
01:14:32,009 --> 01:14:33,977
His sense of self-hate
was so strong...

819
01:14:34,177 --> 01:14:37,271
...that he no longer had
any personality of his own.

820
01:14:37,481 --> 01:14:40,939
Consequently,
he substituted identities...

821
01:14:41,151 --> 01:14:43,619
...found in books, films...

822
01:14:43,820 --> 01:14:45,253
...fan magazines.

823
01:14:45,455 --> 01:14:48,481
Identities with which he had
love-hate relationships.

824
01:14:48,692 --> 01:14:51,058
He wasn't dangerous enough to hold?

825
01:14:51,261 --> 01:14:54,662
Most mentally ill people
are not violent, inspector.

826
01:14:54,865 --> 01:14:59,529
By law, a person who poses no danger
can only be held for 72 hours.

827
01:15:00,570 --> 01:15:04,370
I'm sorry, this is one instance
where the system failed.

828
01:15:04,574 --> 01:15:06,337
Is this address recent?

829
01:15:06,543 --> 01:15:07,976
I assume it's still the same.

830
01:15:12,082 --> 01:15:13,276
Samantha Walker.

831
01:15:13,483 --> 01:15:15,542
<i>This is Peter Swan, Ms. Walker.</i>

832
01:15:15,752 --> 01:15:18,585
<i>Your coverage of my predicament</i>
<i>has been thorough...</i>

833
01:15:18,789 --> 01:15:22,281
<i>... but my side hasn't been told</i>
<i>as well as it could be.</i>

834
01:15:22,492 --> 01:15:23,754
I see.

835
01:15:23,960 --> 01:15:27,088
<i>I'm prepared to grant you</i>
<i>an exclusive interview.</i>

836
01:15:27,297 --> 01:15:29,197
<i>Are you interested?</i>

837
01:15:34,104 --> 01:15:35,571
No doubt about it.

838
01:15:35,772 --> 01:15:37,103
He's our boy, Harry.

839
01:15:37,307 --> 01:15:40,435
Explosives. Caps.

840
01:15:40,644 --> 01:15:41,770
Detonator.

841
01:15:41,978 --> 01:15:43,036
It all connects.

842
01:15:43,613 --> 01:15:45,581
Harry, you gotta see this.

843
01:15:50,454 --> 01:15:52,115
Talk about obsession.

844
01:16:08,805 --> 01:16:12,502
Looks like he had a real
Peter Swan shrine going here.

845
01:16:15,278 --> 01:16:17,143
I'm not sure.

846
01:16:17,347 --> 01:16:19,747
I could have sworn I put it in my bag.

847
01:16:19,950 --> 01:16:22,009
But I'm not sure.

848
01:16:22,219 --> 01:16:25,746
- Bob, do you have my little mike?
- It's in your bag.

849
01:16:25,956 --> 01:16:27,355
Thank you.

850
01:17:05,929 --> 01:17:07,089
Look at this.

851
01:17:10,133 --> 01:17:12,294
I'll call the TV station.

852
01:17:24,514 --> 01:17:28,416
Samantha went out to the shipyard
to interview Peter Swan.

853
01:17:28,618 --> 01:17:30,711
Swan doesn't know anything about it.

854
01:17:30,921 --> 01:17:33,151
- What's this?
- A payroll stub.

855
01:17:33,356 --> 01:17:36,655
Sundown Security, made out to
Ed Butler? I don't get it.

856
01:17:36,860 --> 01:17:40,591
That's the company that provides
security for Swan's locations.

857
01:17:40,797 --> 01:17:43,493
Ed Butler may be an alias for Rook.

858
01:17:43,700 --> 01:17:45,827
Where are you going? Harry?

859
01:17:46,036 --> 01:17:47,765
Harry!

860
01:17:47,971 --> 01:17:49,836
That's my car!

861
01:17:57,814 --> 01:17:58,644
Yes.

862
01:17:58,849 --> 01:18:00,749
That's the shot I'm looking for.

863
01:18:12,262 --> 01:18:14,059
What is it you want from me?

864
01:18:14,264 --> 01:18:16,630
You've got it wrong, love.

865
01:18:17,267 --> 01:18:19,292
This is what you wanted.

866
01:18:19,603 --> 01:18:22,367
An exclusive interview.

867
01:18:23,273 --> 01:18:24,535
But you're not Swan.

868
01:18:24,741 --> 01:18:26,766
Shut up! You don't know!

869
01:18:26,977 --> 01:18:29,104
You don't know!

870
01:18:29,946 --> 01:18:31,641
I know who I am.

871
01:18:32,315 --> 01:18:33,748
Do you know who you are?

872
01:18:34,150 --> 01:18:34,980
Do you?!

873
01:18:35,185 --> 01:18:36,550
Yes.

874
01:18:36,920 --> 01:18:38,387
All those films he made.

875
01:18:38,588 --> 01:18:40,783
Those are my nightmares, not his!

876
01:18:41,558 --> 01:18:45,619
Every night I dream,
and somehow he reads my mind.

877
01:18:45,829 --> 01:18:47,990
He stole my thoughts.

878
01:18:48,198 --> 01:18:52,794
He put my thoughts on film,
and he takes all the credit.

879
01:18:54,905 --> 01:18:56,930
He can't get away with it.

880
01:18:59,576 --> 01:19:01,373
He has to pay.

881
01:19:07,517 --> 01:19:09,644
He stole my nightmares
and made them real.

882
01:19:09,853 --> 01:19:11,718
So I stole his Dead Pool.

883
01:19:12,222 --> 01:19:14,816
I'll play his game and make it real.

884
01:19:17,360 --> 01:19:19,055
He can take credit for that.

885
01:20:44,948 --> 01:20:45,880
Drop it, Rook.

886
01:20:46,082 --> 01:20:50,314
You didn't die, Callahan,
so I had to find another celebrity.

887
01:20:54,824 --> 01:20:55,722
You're next.

888
01:20:55,925 --> 01:20:58,359
Shoot me, Callahan.

889
01:20:58,561 --> 01:21:00,119
Maybe you'll get lucky.

890
01:21:00,330 --> 01:21:04,289
Maybe my muscles won't contract
and drive this knife into her throat.

891
01:21:05,869 --> 01:21:06,893
Let her go.

892
01:21:07,737 --> 01:21:09,034
First the gun.

893
01:21:09,239 --> 01:21:11,366
Drop it and kick it over to me.

894
01:21:15,478 --> 01:21:17,207
Time's up. What's it gonna be?

895
01:21:25,822 --> 01:21:27,084
What the fuck?

896
01:21:31,961 --> 01:21:34,293
You've locked yourself in, asshole.

897
01:21:34,831 --> 01:21:36,230
Yeah.

898
01:21:36,433 --> 01:21:38,230
Just you and me, asshole.

899
01:21:40,970 --> 01:21:42,403
The gun, Callahan.

900
01:21:44,274 --> 01:21:45,104
Now!

901
01:21:45,308 --> 01:21:46,172
No!

902
01:21:46,376 --> 01:21:48,071
He'll kill us both!

903
01:21:50,780 --> 01:21:52,145
Oh, God.

904
01:22:02,358 --> 01:22:06,124
You let me down,
Mr. Famous-Fucking-Cop.

905
01:22:06,496 --> 01:22:08,157
You let Swan get away.

906
01:22:08,364 --> 01:22:09,956
You're the killer, not Swan.

907
01:22:10,266 --> 01:22:11,995
I should have killed you first.

908
01:22:12,202 --> 01:22:14,170
That was my big mistake.

909
01:22:14,471 --> 01:22:15,768
Now kick it over to me.

910
01:22:17,640 --> 01:22:19,608
Harry, don't.

911
01:22:28,518 --> 01:22:30,076
Think you're smart, don't you?

912
01:22:47,270 --> 01:22:49,135
Callahan, you son of a bitch!

913
01:22:55,111 --> 01:22:56,942
I'm gonna kill you slow!

914
01:23:02,085 --> 01:23:04,076
Do you hear that, Callahan?!

915
01:24:20,930 --> 01:24:22,659
Stay in there.

916
01:25:31,868 --> 01:25:33,733
Callahan!

917
01:25:41,344 --> 01:25:43,539
Come on out, Callahan.

918
01:25:56,359 --> 01:25:58,725
There's nowhere left to run, Callahan.

919
01:25:59,662 --> 01:26:01,687
Don't make me come in and get you.

920
01:26:05,535 --> 01:26:07,162
The game's over!

921
01:26:07,370 --> 01:26:08,735
You're out of bullets.

922
01:26:38,568 --> 01:26:40,160
You know what that means.

923
01:26:42,271 --> 01:26:43,670
You're shit out of luck.

924
01:27:28,851 --> 01:27:31,752
- Where's Rook?
- He's hanging out back there.

925
01:27:37,226 --> 01:27:40,127
Inspector, was this another
hit attempt by Janero?

926
01:27:40,329 --> 01:27:42,889
Is it connected to the Dead Pool case?
