181
00:15:34,550 --> 00:15:36,051
LACY WARFIELD.

182
00:15:36,051 --> 00:15:37,052
THANKS, DADDY.

183
00:15:37,052 --> 00:15:39,054
IT'S VERY NICE
TO MEET YOU, MA'AM.

184
00:15:39,054 --> 00:15:42,558
MR. WHITE,
LACY WILL BE HELPING YOU.

185
00:15:42,558 --> 00:15:45,060
HELPING ME?
HELPING ME WHAT?

186
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:47,062
I HAVE SOME MOCK COPIES

187
00:15:47,062 --> 00:15:50,065
OF OUR NEW LAYOUT.
SUPER, ISN'T IT?

188
00:15:50,065 --> 00:15:52,568
THE SUIT'S NOT RIGHT,
BUT WE'LL CHANGE IT.

189
00:15:52,568 --> 00:15:54,570
EXCUSE ME, MR. WARFIELD,

190
00:15:54,570 --> 00:15:56,572
BUT THE WORLD ISN'T
REALLY ON THE BRINK.

191
00:15:56,572 --> 00:15:59,074
ISN'T THAT HEADLINE
IRRESPONSIBLE?

192
00:15:59,074 --> 00:16:01,577
MAYBE, BUT IT'LL SELL
A LOT OF NEWSPAPERS.

193
00:16:03,078 --> 00:16:05,080
DON'T DO ANYTHING RASH.

194
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:08,083
I WON'T LET YOU TURN
THIS GRAND OLD LADY

195
00:16:08,083 --> 00:16:09,084
INTO ONE OF YOUR BIMBOS!

196
00:16:09,084 --> 00:16:10,085
MR. WHITE.

197
00:16:10,586 --> 00:16:13,589
MAY I POINT OUT THAT DADDY
HOLDS ALL YOUR CONTRACTS,

198
00:16:13,589 --> 00:16:16,091
WHICH YOU WILL
HAVE TO HONOR.

199
00:16:16,592 --> 00:16:19,094
EXCUSEZ-MOI...
YOUR SPOILEDNESS.

200
00:16:19,094 --> 00:16:21,597
WHY IS LOIS TRYING
TO SPEAK FRENCH?

201
00:16:21,597 --> 00:16:23,098
I'M FLYING TO PARIS

202
00:16:23,098 --> 00:16:25,601
FOR THE EMERGENCY
MINISTERS CONFERENCE--

203
00:16:26,101 --> 00:16:29,104
NOT SO FAST.
ALL TRIPS ARE CANCELED.

204
00:16:29,104 --> 00:16:32,107
MY TRIP TO PARIS
IS CANCELED?

205
00:16:32,107 --> 00:16:34,610
MR. WHITE,
SHOW ME YOUR BOOKS.

206
00:16:34,610 --> 00:16:37,613
EVERYBODY ELSE,
GET BACK TO WORK.

207
00:16:37,613 --> 00:16:39,615
WE'RE BEING
TREATED UNFAIRLY.

208
00:16:39,615 --> 00:16:40,616
I'LL SPEAK
TO MISS WARFIELD.

209
00:16:40,616 --> 00:16:41,617
ME, TOO.

210
00:16:41,617 --> 00:16:42,618
EXCUSE ME,
MISS WARFIELD?

211
00:16:42,618 --> 00:16:43,619
YES?

212
00:16:43,619 --> 00:16:45,621
I THINK I SPEAK FOR
ALL OF US WHEN I SAY

213
00:16:45,621 --> 00:16:47,623
THAT WE'LL ALL DO
OUR BEST TO COOPERATE.

214
00:16:47,623 --> 00:16:49,124
THANK YOU.

215
00:16:49,124 --> 00:16:50,626
BUT A REPORTER'S
FIRST ALLEGIANCE

216
00:16:50,626 --> 00:16:52,127
IS TO THE TRUTH.

217
00:16:52,628 --> 00:16:55,130
THIS CITY'S PEOPLE
DEPEND ON US.

218
00:16:55,130 --> 00:16:57,132
WE CAN'T
LET THEM DOWN.

219
00:16:57,132 --> 00:16:58,634
THANK YOU.

220
00:17:03,138 --> 00:17:05,140
IS HE FOR REAL?

221
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:09,144
100%, AND I LIKE
HIM THAT WAY, OK?

222
00:17:09,144 --> 00:17:11,647
YOU HAVE
A THING FOR HIM?

223
00:17:11,647 --> 00:17:14,149
FOR CLARK?
NO! HA HA HA!

224
00:17:14,149 --> 00:17:16,151
HE'S KIND OF CUTE.

225
00:17:16,151 --> 00:17:18,654
UH, LOOK,
MISS WARFIELD...

226
00:17:18,654 --> 00:17:22,157
CLARK IS THE OLDEST
LIVING BOY SCOUT, OK?

227
00:17:22,157 --> 00:17:24,660
HE'S TRUSTWORTHY,
HE'S HELPFUL,

228
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:26,662
HE'S LOYAL,
 HE'S OBEDIENT,

229
00:17:26,662 --> 00:17:28,163
HE...

230
00:17:28,163 --> 00:17:31,166
I DON'T KNOW HOW
TO TELL YOU THIS.

231
00:17:31,166 --> 00:17:35,671
I JUST DON'T THINK HE'D BE
ATTRACTED TO SOMEBODY LIKE YOU.

232
00:17:35,671 --> 00:17:38,173
DON'T BE SILLY.
ALL MEN LIKE ME.

233
00:17:38,173 --> 00:17:40,175
I'M VERY, VERY RICH.

234
00:17:40,509 --> 00:17:43,595
WHY DON'T YOU HAVE
AIR TRAVEL EXPENSES?

235
00:17:43,595 --> 00:17:45,597
I USUALLY
GET AIR SICK,

236
00:17:45,597 --> 00:17:47,599
ESPECIALLY
WHEN IT'S BUMPY.

237
00:17:47,599 --> 00:17:50,102
LOIS, GET IN HERE!

238
00:17:52,104 --> 00:17:54,606
LOIS, EXPLAIN THIS
COLUMN OF FIGURES.

239
00:17:55,107 --> 00:17:57,609
CHIEF, THE PRESIDENT'S
COMING ON LIVE.

240
00:17:57,609 --> 00:17:59,111
OH, HE IS? OH.

241
00:17:59,111 --> 00:18:01,113
I DOUBT
IT'S GOOD NEWS.

242
00:18:01,113 --> 00:18:03,115
IT WON'T BE
THAT TERRIBLE.

243
00:18:03,615 --> 00:18:05,617
HOPEFULLY,
VERY TERRIBLE, MISS LANE.

244
00:18:05,617 --> 00:18:07,619
WE COULD DOUBLE
OUR CIRCULATION

245
00:18:07,619 --> 00:18:10,122
WITH A GOOD
INTERNATIONAL CRISIS.

246
00:18:10,122 --> 00:18:12,624
AND BECAUSE
THE SUMMIT HAS FAILED,

247
00:18:12,624 --> 00:18:14,626
WE HAVE NO CHOICE

248
00:18:15,127 --> 00:18:17,629
BUT TO STRIVE
TO BE SECOND TO NONE

249
00:18:18,130 --> 00:18:19,631
IN THE NUCLEAR ARMS RACE.

250
00:18:20,132 --> 00:18:24,136
THEREFORE, I AM ANNOUNCING 
THE FOLLOWING MEASURES--

251
00:18:27,639 --> 00:18:30,642
I KNOW YOU'RE ALL UPSET
BY THE CRISIS.

252
00:18:30,642 --> 00:18:34,646
THE BEST THING WE CAN DO
IS THINK POSITIVELY.

253
00:18:34,646 --> 00:18:38,150
NOW, IS THERE
ANYTHING WE CAN DO?

254
00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:40,152
DOESN'T ANYONE
HAVE A SUGGESTION?

255
00:18:41,153 --> 00:18:43,155
ALL RIGHT.

256
00:18:43,155 --> 00:18:45,157
I'LL MAKE A SUGGESTION.

257
00:18:46,658 --> 00:18:48,160
LET'S WRITE
OUR CONGRESSMEN.

258
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:50,162
THAT'LL DO
A LOT OF GOOD.

259
00:18:50,162 --> 00:18:54,166
SOMEBODY HAS TO BE
AN OPTIMIST.

260
00:18:54,166 --> 00:18:55,667
JEREMY?

261
00:18:57,169 --> 00:19:00,172
WHAT CAN WE DO
ABOUT THE CRISIS?

262
00:19:00,172 --> 00:19:01,673
HE DOESN'T KNOW
WHAT'S HAPPENING.

263
00:19:02,174 --> 00:19:06,678
I'D WRITE A LETTER TO SOMEONE
THAT WOULD DO SOME GOOD.

264
00:19:07,179 --> 00:19:08,180
WHO, SANTA CLAUS?

265
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:10,682
NO! SUPERMAN!

266
00:19:10,682 --> 00:19:13,185
SUPERMAN, THE SUBJECT
OF OUR NEWEST EXHIBIT,

267
00:19:13,185 --> 00:19:16,188
HAS GRACIOUSLY DONATED A STRAND
OF HIS HAIR TO THE MUSEUM,

268
00:19:16,688 --> 00:19:19,691
SO WE CAN SEE HOW STRONG
HE REALLY IS.

269
00:19:20,192 --> 00:19:22,694
HERE YOU CAN SEE
A 1,000-POUND LOAD

270
00:19:23,195 --> 00:19:24,696
EASILY SUSPENDED
BY HIS SINGLE HAIR.

271
00:19:25,197 --> 00:19:27,199
THE MUSEUM WILL
BE CLOSING SOON,

272
00:19:27,699 --> 00:19:30,202
SO WE SHOULD
HURRY A LITTLE.

273
00:19:31,203 --> 00:19:34,206
YOU KNOW WHAT
I CAN DO WITH THAT HAIR?

274
00:19:34,706 --> 00:19:37,709
YOU CAN MAKE
A TOUPEE THAT FLIES.

275
00:19:37,709 --> 00:19:39,211
THAT HAIR IS A SAMPLE

276
00:19:39,211 --> 00:19:41,213
OF SUPERMAN'S
GENETIC MATERIAL,

277
00:19:41,713 --> 00:19:43,715
THE BUILDING BLOCKS
OF HIS BODY.

278
00:19:44,216 --> 00:19:47,219
WITH ENOUGH NUCLEAR POWER
TO MUTATE THE GENES,

279
00:19:47,719 --> 00:19:52,224
I CAN CREATE A BEING WHO'S
MORE POWERFUL THAN HIM,

280
00:19:52,724 --> 00:19:55,727
WHO HAS TOTAL
ALLEGIANCE TO ME.

281
00:19:56,728 --> 00:19:58,230
[SNAP]

282
00:20:04,236 --> 00:20:05,737
YOU BETTER
STAND BACK.

283
00:20:06,238 --> 00:20:08,240
KEEP YOUR EYE OUT.

284
00:20:10,242 --> 00:20:12,244
[ALARM]

285
00:20:37,686 --> 00:20:39,688
YOU WANTED
TO SEE ME?

286
00:20:39,688 --> 00:20:42,691
YEAH, HI, CLARK.
PLEASE, COME IN.

287
00:20:42,691 --> 00:20:45,694
I'VE COME UP WITH
A BRILLIANT IDEA.

288
00:20:45,694 --> 00:20:47,195
OH...REALLY?

289
00:20:47,195 --> 00:20:49,197
WELL, DADDY THINKS
IT'S BRILLIANT.

290
00:20:49,197 --> 00:20:51,199
YOU'LL WRITE THIS NEW SERIES

291
00:20:51,199 --> 00:20:53,201
CALLEDMETROPOLIS AFTER HOURS.

292
00:20:53,201 --> 00:20:55,203
WHO, ME? I...

293
00:20:55,203 --> 00:20:57,205
IT'S WONDERFUL.

294
00:20:57,205 --> 00:20:59,207
IT'S GREAT,
ISN'T IT?

295
00:20:59,207 --> 00:21:01,209
I'M NOT
RIGHT FOR THIS.

296
00:21:01,209 --> 00:21:03,211
YOU'RE PERFECT
FOR IT.

297
00:21:03,211 --> 00:21:04,212
YOU'RE YOUNG,

298
00:21:04,212 --> 00:21:06,214
YOU'RE SINGLE,
YOU'RE SUCCESSFUL.

299
00:21:06,214 --> 00:21:08,717
I'M USUALLY
IN BED BY 10:30.

300
00:21:08,717 --> 00:21:11,219
THAT'S JUST IT.
YOU DON'T FLAUNT IT.

301
00:21:11,219 --> 00:21:13,722
YOU'RE NO SLAVE
TO FASHION, ALTHOUGH...

302
00:21:13,722 --> 00:21:15,724
HAVE YOU CONSIDERED 
USING CONTACTS?

303
00:21:16,224 --> 00:21:18,727
UH, THEY, UH,
MAKE MY EYES ITCH.

304
00:21:18,727 --> 00:21:22,731
LISTEN, I THOUGHT WE
COULD DO THIS TOGETHER.

305
00:21:22,731 --> 00:21:25,233
I KNOW ALL
THE RIGHT PLACES.

306
00:21:25,233 --> 00:21:27,736
I BELONG
TO THE RIGHT CLUBS.

307
00:21:27,736 --> 00:21:29,738
WE'LL START TONIGHT
AT THE METRO CLUB.

308
00:21:30,238 --> 00:21:31,239
OH, TONIGHT?

309
00:21:31,239 --> 00:21:32,741
YEAH. IT'S A DATE.

310
00:21:32,741 --> 00:21:34,242
A DATE?

311
00:21:34,242 --> 00:21:35,243
A DATE?

312
00:21:35,243 --> 00:21:37,746
UH, WELL, IT'S JUST 
BUSINESS, ACTUALLY.

313
00:21:37,746 --> 00:21:41,750
I'VE GOT A LETTER
FOR SUPERMAN, CARE OF ME.

314
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:43,752
SUPERMAN
GETS MAIL HERE?

315
00:21:43,752 --> 00:21:46,254
IT'S PROBABLY JUST
A PICTURE REQUEST.

316
00:21:46,254 --> 00:21:47,255
I COULD LOOK AFTER
IT FOR YOU, LOIS.

317
00:21:47,756 --> 00:21:49,758
I THINK IT'S MORE
THAN A FAN LETTER.

318
00:21:49,758 --> 00:21:51,760
I THINK YOU
SHOULD READ IT.

319
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:55,263
"DEAR SUPERMAN,
MY TEACHER IS SPEAKING

320
00:21:55,263 --> 00:21:57,265
"ABOUT THE PRESIDENT'S
SPEECH ON THE ARMS RACE.

321
00:21:57,265 --> 00:22:01,770
"WE'RE ALL
VERY UNHAPPY ABOUT IT,

322
00:22:01,770 --> 00:22:04,272
"AND I SAID
WE SHOULD GET SUPERMAN

323
00:22:04,773 --> 00:22:06,274
"TO RID THE WORLD
OF NUCLEAR ARMS

324
00:22:06,274 --> 00:22:09,778
BECAUSE ONLY
HE COULD DO IT."

325
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:14,783
"EVERYBODY THINKS
I'M A SPACE CADET.

326
00:22:14,783 --> 00:22:16,284
"ONCE YOU'VE DESTROYED
ALL NUCLEAR MISSILES,

327
00:22:16,284 --> 00:22:17,285
"THEY'LL SEE
I WAS RIGHT.

328
00:22:17,285 --> 00:22:18,286
"SUPERMAN CAN MAKE SURE

329
00:22:18,286 --> 00:22:19,788
"WE DON'T BLOW
OURSELVES UP.

330
00:22:20,288 --> 00:22:22,791
"THANKS A LOT. I KNOW
YOU'LL COME THROUGH.

331
00:22:22,791 --> 00:22:24,793
YOUR FRIEND, JEREMY."

332
00:22:24,793 --> 00:22:25,794
POOR KID.

333
00:22:25,794 --> 00:22:28,296
I'LL GET BACK TO WORK.

334
00:22:28,296 --> 00:22:30,298
THERE'S AN ANGLE
IN THIS.

335
00:22:30,298 --> 00:22:32,300
AN ANGLE?
HE'S JUST A KID!

336
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:34,302
DADDY LOVES WHIPPING
UP CAMPAIGNS,

337
00:22:34,302 --> 00:22:36,304
AND THE PUBLIC
LOVES IT!

338
00:22:36,304 --> 00:22:38,306
LACY!

339
00:22:38,306 --> 00:22:40,308
WE'RE GOING TO MAKE
THIS KID A CELEBRITY.

340
00:22:40,308 --> 00:22:42,310
EVERYBODY IN THE WORLD
WILL WONDER

341
00:22:42,310 --> 00:22:44,813
WHAT SUPERMAN'S 
REPLY IS.

342
00:22:48,316 --> 00:22:50,318
WELCOME TO
METROPOLIS, JEREMY.

343
00:22:50,318 --> 00:22:51,820
I'M MR. WARFIELD,

344
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:53,822
AND THIS IS
MY DAUGHTER LACY.

345
00:22:54,322 --> 00:22:54,823
HI, JEREMY.

346
00:22:55,323 --> 00:22:56,825
NOW COME ALONG
AND MEET THE PRESS.

347
00:22:56,825 --> 00:22:57,826
HAVE A GOOD TRIP?

348
00:22:58,326 --> 00:22:59,327
CAR HAD A FLAT.

349
00:22:59,327 --> 00:23:00,829
OH, I'M SORRY
TO HEAR THAT.

350
00:23:00,829 --> 00:23:04,332
HERE, LET EVERYBODY
GET A PICTURE OF YOU.

351
00:23:04,332 --> 00:23:05,333
THAT'S IT, EVERYONE.

352
00:23:05,333 --> 00:23:06,334
JEREMY, OVER HERE.

01:25:40,135 --> 01:25:42,637
ONE THING--
HOW'D YOU BEAT HIM?

1245
01:25:42,637 --> 01:25:44,139
HIGH SCHOOL PHYSICS.

1246
01:25:44,639 --> 01:25:46,641
I FIGURED
THAT IF YOUR CREATURE

1247
01:25:46,641 --> 01:25:48,643
WAS BORN FROM THE SUN,

1248
01:25:48,643 --> 01:25:50,645
THAT WAS
HIS ENERGY SOURCE.

1249
01:25:50,645 --> 01:25:52,147
WILL THE WORLD
BE VAPORIZED?

1250
01:25:52,147 --> 01:25:53,648
NO, LUTHOR.

1251
01:25:53,648 --> 01:25:55,150
AS ALWAYS,
IT'S ON THE BRINK,

1252
01:25:55,150 --> 01:25:57,152
WITH GOOD FIGHTING EVIL.

1253
01:25:57,152 --> 01:25:58,653
SEE YOU IN 20.
