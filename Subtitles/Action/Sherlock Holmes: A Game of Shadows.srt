00:00:31,602 --> 00:00:34,937
WATSON:
The year was 1891

2
00:00:35,105 --> 00:00:37,523
Storm clouds were brewing over Europe.

3
00:00:39,109 --> 00:00:42,403
France and Germany
were at each other's throats...

4
00:00:42,571 --> 00:00:45,531
...the result of a series of bombings.

5
00:00:47,201 --> 00:00:49,702
Some said it was Nationalists...

6
00:00:50,204 --> 00:00:52,371
...others, the anarchists.

7
00:00:52,539 --> 00:00:54,540
But as usual...

8
00:00:55,042 --> 00:00:58,419
...my friend Sherlock Holmes...

9
00:00:58,587 --> 00:01:00,671
...had a different theory entirely.

10
00:01:07,596 --> 00:01:10,598
MAN 1 :
Bombing in Strasbourg! Read all about it!

11
00:01:11,558 --> 00:01:13,434
MAN 2: Thank you.
MAN 1 : Anarchists suspected...

12
00:01:13,602 --> 00:01:16,062
...in Strasbourg bombing!

13
00:01:25,822 --> 00:01:28,407
Bombing in Strasbourg!

14
00:02:02,276 --> 00:02:05,278
When did you start working
for the postal service?

15
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:08,447
That was you back there.

16
00:02:08,615 --> 00:02:11,242
Shame your activities
have landed you in the gutter.

17
00:02:11,410 --> 00:02:14,537
A curious parcel.
Who's the intended recipient?

18
00:02:14,705 --> 00:02:16,789
Why don't we discuss that
over dinner tonight?

19
00:02:16,957 --> 00:02:19,000
-I'm free for lunch.
-Hmm. I'm not.

20
00:02:19,167 --> 00:02:21,669
How about the Savoy, 8:00?

21
00:02:21,837 --> 00:02:22,878
-Splendid.
-Hmm.

22
00:02:23,046 --> 00:02:24,797
And will you be coming as yourself?

23
00:02:24,965 --> 00:02:27,174
Most likely.

24
00:02:27,926 --> 00:02:30,636
Three men have been following you
for the last half mile...

25
00:02:30,804 --> 00:02:32,763
...their motives highly unsavory.

26
00:02:35,559 --> 00:02:37,059
No.

27
00:02:45,235 --> 00:02:48,988
Oh, and, by the way, they're not
pursuing me, they're escorting me.

28
00:02:49,156 --> 00:02:53,117
And instead of three,
there seems to be, uh, four.

29
00:02:53,285 --> 00:02:54,327
Heh.

30
00:02:56,121 --> 00:02:57,621
Steady hands with that, Irene.

31
00:02:57,789 --> 00:03:00,833
Oh, I don't think it's my hands
you have to worry about.

32
00:03:01,001 --> 00:03:04,003
Be careful with the face, boys.
We do have a dinner date tonight.

33
00:03:04,504 --> 00:03:05,546
Don't fill up on bread.

34
00:03:31,114 --> 00:03:32,365
I forgot the rest.

35
00:03:36,536 --> 00:03:37,745
Oh, it's coming back now.

36
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:00,059
THUG:
Aah!

37
00:04:00,894 --> 00:04:02,269
Aah!

38
00:04:07,734 --> 00:04:08,901
Peelers!

39
00:05:16,928 --> 00:05:20,973
AUCTIONEER:
We now come to Lot 34...

40
00:05:21,141 --> 00:05:25,978
...Egyptian sarcophagus
of outstanding provenance...

41
00:05:26,146 --> 00:05:28,147
...retrieved from the Valley of the Kings.

42
00:05:28,315 --> 00:05:30,524
Your payment, doctor.
He sends his thanks.

43
00:05:30,692 --> 00:05:31,817
Who will bid...

44
00:05:32,152 --> 00:05:33,277
...1 00 pounds?

45
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:35,571
One hundred. Thank you, sir.

46
00:05:37,407 --> 00:05:40,159
HOFFMANSTAHL: Please, give this to him.
He's expecting it.

47
00:05:40,702 --> 00:05:44,121
Tell him our friend thinks
I delivered it to his sister.

48
00:05:49,419 --> 00:05:51,670
Uh-- Stay...

49
00:05:51,838 --> 00:05:53,672
...while I check the contents.

50
00:05:54,883 --> 00:05:57,301
I was assured full payment
would be there.

51
00:05:57,469 --> 00:06:00,262
Yes, but assured by whom?

52
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:02,181
Have you ever met him in person?

53
00:06:03,850 --> 00:06:05,726
Or like me, have you been--?

54
00:06:06,645 --> 00:06:08,812
Hold it, hold it. Please, don't move it.

55
00:06:09,356 --> 00:06:12,650
Judging from size and weight,
it's not the payment you were expecting.

56
00:06:13,401 --> 00:06:15,778
I'd wager the contents
are rather more incendiary.

57
00:06:15,946 --> 00:06:18,280
-Who is this?
-It's....

58
00:06:18,448 --> 00:06:19,490
Hello, darling.

59
00:06:24,996 --> 00:06:29,041
Oh, dear. I told you not to move it. It seems
a secondary charge has been activated.

60
00:06:29,209 --> 00:06:32,253
Sweet thing, I might need your help
in the disposal of this parcel.

61
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:37,174
One thousand six hundred, 1 700, 1 800.

62
00:06:37,342 --> 00:06:39,301
-Well, good luck.
HOLMES: One million pounds.

63
00:06:42,097 --> 00:06:44,515
Oh, and by the way, fire.

64
00:06:44,683 --> 00:06:45,891
Fire!

65
00:06:51,606 --> 00:06:53,482
Leave my side,
you'll be dead in an hour.

66
00:06:53,650 --> 00:06:55,192
And don't be late for dinner.

67
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:58,487
My schedule will be quite tight
because of these activities here.

68
00:06:58,655 --> 00:07:02,408
-I've never been late in my life, only early.
-Fashionably.

69
00:07:03,034 --> 00:07:04,410
Mm. Mm-mm. Mm!

70
00:07:04,578 --> 00:07:07,329
Very witty. So confident, even in retreat.

71
00:07:07,497 --> 00:07:10,624
I'll hold onto that.
We'll read it together over an aperitif.

72
00:07:10,792 --> 00:07:14,295
Fine. Dinner and a show.

73
00:07:18,258 --> 00:07:21,093
Stay. Trust me.
This is what I do for a living.

74
00:07:22,971 --> 00:07:25,764
Herr Hoffmanstahl,
you should count yourself lucky.

75
00:07:26,266 --> 00:07:30,603
This faceless man with whom you find
yourself in business is no ordinary criminal.

76
00:07:30,770 --> 00:07:35,399
He's the Napoleon of crime.
Fortunately, you now have me as an ally.

77
00:07:35,567 --> 00:07:38,819
I'm a consulting detective
of some repute.

78
00:07:38,987 --> 00:07:41,697
Perhaps you've heard of me?
My name is Sherlock...

79
00:07:44,618 --> 00:07:45,618
...Holmes.

80
00:07:45,785 --> 00:07:46,827
MAN:
Hyah!

81
00:08:30,830 --> 00:08:33,290
A fresh pot of tea. Thank you, George.

82
00:08:33,458 --> 00:08:35,250
GEORGE:
Yes, Miss Adler.

83
00:08:37,003 --> 00:08:39,713
MAN:
Fine choice, this place.

84
00:08:41,383 --> 00:08:42,925
Do you have the letter?

85
00:08:44,010 --> 00:08:45,094
It was taken.

86
00:08:45,929 --> 00:08:49,098
MAN:
Taken? Now, that is unfortunate.

87
00:08:52,018 --> 00:08:55,187
During the chaos created
by your package.

88
00:08:55,355 --> 00:08:56,355
Thank you.

89
00:08:58,983 --> 00:09:03,028
Perhaps if you had shared your plans.

90
00:09:03,530 --> 00:09:06,448
You wish to know my plans now,
do you?

91
00:09:06,616 --> 00:09:10,077
Did you imagine, Miss Adler,
that something would happen to you?

92
00:09:10,245 --> 00:09:13,122
Is that why you chose to meet here
in a public place?

93
00:09:13,289 --> 00:09:14,540
Your favorite restaurant?

94
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:48,949
I don't blame you.

95
00:09:50,326 --> 00:09:52,619
I blame myself.

96
00:09:53,329 --> 00:09:58,542
It's been apparent to me for some time that
you had succumbed to your feelings for him.

97
00:10:00,044 --> 00:10:05,382
And this isn't the first occasion Mr. Holmes
has inconvenienced me in recent months.

98
00:10:06,176 --> 00:10:08,093
The question is...

99
00:10:09,012 --> 00:10:11,722
...what to do about it.

100
00:10:16,770 --> 00:10:21,523
But that's my problem to solve now.

101
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:27,780
I no longer require your services.

102
00:11:57,704 --> 00:11:59,454
Mrs. Hudson?

103
00:12:00,874 --> 00:12:03,375
Oh, Mrs. Hudson?

104
00:12:05,879 --> 00:12:08,088
Holmes, you in there?

105
00:12:15,889 --> 00:12:18,098
Your hedge needs trimming.

106
00:12:20,727 --> 00:12:23,186
HOLMES [WHISPERING]:
Where am I?

107
00:12:23,354 --> 00:12:26,231
WATSON: I don't care where you are
as long as you're ready.

108
00:12:30,111 --> 00:12:32,279
HOLMES:
I'm waiting.

109
00:12:36,242 --> 00:12:37,659
I'm not gonna play this game.

110
00:12:38,745 --> 00:12:42,080
Remember, I have to catch the last...

111
00:12:46,336 --> 00:12:48,128
-...train.
HOLMES [lN NORMAL VOICE]: Uh-oh.

112
00:12:48,296 --> 00:12:51,298
-That's you dead, I'm afraid.
-You win.

113
00:12:53,301 --> 00:12:57,179
I lose. Game over.

114
00:12:58,765 --> 00:13:01,058
HOLMES:
Still don't see me?

115
00:13:10,777 --> 00:13:12,945
I'm not going out with you
dressed like that.

116
00:13:14,781 --> 00:13:17,324
Would you prefer I joined you
in the fashion faux pas...

117
00:13:17,492 --> 00:13:20,702
...of wearing fine military dress
with that heinous handmade scarf...

118
00:13:20,870 --> 00:13:23,246
...clearly one of your fianc¨¦e's
early efforts?

119
00:13:23,957 --> 00:13:25,582
Oh, how I've missed you, Holmes.

120
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:28,335
Have you? Why?

121
00:13:28,962 --> 00:13:32,381
I've barely noticed your absence.
Then again, I'm knee-deep in research.

122
00:13:32,548 --> 00:13:35,384
Extracting fluids from
the adrenal glands of sheep...

123
00:13:35,551 --> 00:13:38,261
...and designing
my own urban camouflage...

124
00:13:38,429 --> 00:13:40,973
...all the while verging
on a decisive breakthrough...

125
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:45,477
...in the single most important case
of my career, perhaps of all time.

126
00:13:47,647 --> 00:13:48,855
Mrs. Hudson, how are you?

127
00:13:49,023 --> 00:13:52,985
Oh. I'm so pleased to see you, doctor.
Thank you for inviting me tomorrow.

128
00:13:53,152 --> 00:13:55,779
And thank you for looking after
Gladstone.

129
00:13:55,947 --> 00:14:01,910
Dear, dear sickly-sweet Nanny,
might I have a word?

130
00:14:03,246 --> 00:14:06,623
Yummy. Feed the snake, woman.

131
00:14:06,958 --> 00:14:08,875
You feed it.

132
00:14:09,836 --> 00:14:12,504
Touchy, touchy.

133
00:14:13,798 --> 00:14:16,174
Doctor, you must get him
to a sanatorium.

134
00:14:16,426 --> 00:14:19,469
He's been on a diet of coffee, tobacco,
and coca leaves.

135
00:14:19,929 --> 00:14:23,765
He never sleeps. l hear multiple voices
as if he's rehearsing a play.

136
00:14:26,394 --> 00:14:29,771
-Leave him to me.
-Don't you have a goat that needs worming?

137
00:14:29,939 --> 00:14:32,399
Oh, how kind of you to remind me.

138
00:14:32,567 --> 00:14:36,570
So much to look forward to.
What would I do without you?

139
00:14:37,655 --> 00:14:39,740
Good luck with your patient, doctor.

140
00:14:40,867 --> 00:14:42,034
Why are you here?

141
00:14:43,244 --> 00:14:45,245
I'm getting married tomorrow.

142
00:14:46,664 --> 00:14:48,498
Oh! Embrace me.

143
00:14:49,709 --> 00:14:51,585
Watson's getting married.

144
00:14:51,753 --> 00:14:55,130
-You've lost a few pounds, Holmes.
-Yes, and you've picked them up.

145
00:14:55,298 --> 00:14:58,341
-Noshing on Mary's muffins, no doubt.
-Ha.

146
00:14:58,509 --> 00:15:01,386
Pour us a brandy.
The stag party has begun.

147
00:15:02,805 --> 00:15:05,724
It is our last adventure, Watson.

148
00:15:05,892 --> 00:15:07,934
I intend to make the most of it.

149
00:15:19,572 --> 00:15:21,823
WATSON: I see you've made good use
of my old office.

150
00:15:21,991 --> 00:15:24,743
HOLMES: Do you like my spider's web?
WATSON: Is that what you call it?

151
00:15:25,244 --> 00:15:26,661
Follow that strand.

152
00:15:28,081 --> 00:15:32,417
Question: What do a scandal involving
an Indian cotton tycoon...

153
00:15:32,585 --> 00:15:34,669
...the overdose of
a Chinese opium trader...

154
00:15:34,837 --> 00:15:36,838
...bombings in Strasbourg and Vienna...

155
00:15:37,006 --> 00:15:40,467
...and the death of a steel magnate
in America all have in common?

156
00:15:42,428 --> 00:15:48,100
WATSON: Well, according to your diorama,
Professor James Moriarty.

157
00:15:48,267 --> 00:15:49,267
HOLMES:
Indeed.

158
00:15:50,144 --> 00:15:54,523
Mathematical genius.
Celebrated author and lecturer.

159
00:15:54,690 --> 00:15:56,274
HOLMES:
Boxing champion at Cambridge...

160
00:15:56,442 --> 00:15:59,402
...where he made friends
with our current prime minister.

161
00:15:59,570 --> 00:16:02,280
Do you have any evidence
to substantiate your claim?

162
00:16:06,035 --> 00:16:08,370
This. Now do you see?

163
00:16:10,456 --> 00:16:12,749
WATSON: Dr. Hoffmanstahl's death?
-Yes.

164
00:16:12,917 --> 00:16:15,252
I've heard you speak of him,
extolling his virtues.

165
00:16:15,419 --> 00:16:19,214
Hoffmanstahl was at the forefront
of medical innovations, a true pioneer.

166
00:16:19,382 --> 00:16:22,884
Just the other day, l averted
an explosion that was intended for him.

167
00:16:24,095 --> 00:16:26,179
Says here he died of a heart attack.

168
00:16:26,389 --> 00:16:30,767
Has all my instruction been for naught? You
still read the official statement and believe it.

169
00:16:30,935 --> 00:16:33,311
It's a game, dear man, a shadowy game.

170
00:16:33,479 --> 00:16:37,357
We're playing cat and mouse,
the professor and I. Cloak and dagger.

171
00:16:37,984 --> 00:16:39,526
I thought it was spider and fly?

172
00:16:40,945 --> 00:16:42,737
I'm not a fly, I'm a cat.

173
00:16:42,905 --> 00:16:45,156
Not a mouse, but a dagger.

174
00:16:45,324 --> 00:16:46,825
You're drinking embalming fluid.

175
00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:50,662
Ooh. Yes. Care for a drop?

176
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:52,122
You do seem--

177
00:16:52,290 --> 00:16:53,331
-Excited?
-Manic.

178
00:16:53,499 --> 00:16:54,499
-I am.
-Verging on--

179
00:16:54,667 --> 00:16:56,126
-Ecstatic?
-Psychotic.

180
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:01,047
-Should've brought a sedative.
-I'll give my life to see his demise.

181
00:17:01,215 --> 00:17:05,510
He must be stopped before
his evil machinations come to a crescendo.

182
00:17:05,678 --> 00:17:06,970
And how will he do all this?

183
00:17:07,138 --> 00:17:10,932
Don't be a dingy bird. Bad people
do bad things because they can.

184
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:15,186
No one, not the victims, the police,
the governments, not anyone--

185
00:17:15,354 --> 00:17:17,981
-Except the great Sherlock Holmes...
-Correct.

186
00:17:18,149 --> 00:17:20,483
-...on this diet, will work it all out.
-Right.

187
00:17:20,651 --> 00:17:23,403
-Or thereabouts.
-Thereabouts, not quite there.

188
00:17:23,821 --> 00:17:25,697
Here's to your good health.

189
00:17:26,991 --> 00:17:28,658
Dingy bird.

190
00:17:32,705 --> 00:17:35,248
What have you done to Gladstone now?

191
00:17:35,416 --> 00:17:39,294
Ricinus communis.
The fruit is highly toxic.

192
00:17:39,462 --> 00:17:40,879
He's barely breathing.

193
00:17:41,505 --> 00:17:43,965
What an excellent opportunity.

194
00:17:44,133 --> 00:17:45,300
This may be just the thing.

195
00:17:46,677 --> 00:17:49,930
Sorry, do you mind terribly
if I try my adrenal extract?

196
00:17:50,097 --> 00:17:52,557
How many times are you going
to kill my dog, Holmes?

197
00:17:55,561 --> 00:17:57,479
Took off like a monkey from a box.

198
00:17:57,647 --> 00:18:00,273
-Hmm.
-I may need one of those in a few hours.

199
00:18:00,441 --> 00:18:02,025
HOLMES:
Consider it a wedding gift.

200
00:18:03,611 --> 00:18:06,529
Watson, might we use
an alternative exit?

201
00:18:07,657 --> 00:18:10,033
Is there something different about you?

202
00:18:10,242 --> 00:18:12,243
I'm under observation.

203
00:18:12,995 --> 00:18:14,287
As you should be.

204
00:18:14,455 --> 00:18:15,830
HOLMES:
You drive.

205
00:18:19,168 --> 00:18:22,837
WATSON:
Will your beard be with us all night?

206
00:18:23,005 --> 00:18:26,508
HOLMES: l'll remove it once
we're south of Trafalgar Square.

207
00:18:27,635 --> 00:18:30,261
WATSON: If you believe Moriarty
has you under observation...

208
00:18:30,429 --> 00:18:32,138
...isn't this a bit conspicuous?

209
00:18:32,306 --> 00:18:35,600
HOLMES:
It's so overt, it's covert.

210
00:18:39,271 --> 00:18:42,607
WATSON: Trafalgar Square.
You must be safe by now.

211
00:18:50,116 --> 00:18:52,867
Why are you looking at me
with such concern?

212
00:18:53,035 --> 00:18:57,664
I'm so very worried.
Your vitality's been drained from you.

213
00:18:57,999 --> 00:19:01,584
-Marriage is the end, I tell you.
-I think of it as the beginning.

214
00:19:01,752 --> 00:19:03,044
-Armageddon.
-Rebirth.

215
00:19:03,212 --> 00:19:04,713
-Restriction.
-Structure.

216
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:07,549
-Answering to a woman.
-Being in a relationship.

217
00:19:08,217 --> 00:19:12,053
A life in matrimony,
the possibility of a family.

218
00:19:12,221 --> 00:19:13,847
Who wants to die alone?

219
00:19:14,932 --> 00:19:17,058
We'll have a good old-fashioned
romp tonight...

220
00:19:17,226 --> 00:19:20,729
...you'll settle down, have a family,
and I'll die alone.

221
00:19:21,188 --> 00:19:23,231
WATSON:
Yes, that's about it.

222
00:19:25,192 --> 00:19:30,780
Perhaps it's better for one to die alone
than to live life in eternal purgatory.

223
00:19:33,993 --> 00:19:35,660
Anyway....

224
00:19:40,332 --> 00:19:42,000
Not bad, that.

225
00:19:42,168 --> 00:19:44,002
So where are we going?

226
00:19:44,170 --> 00:19:47,756
MYCROFT: In the future, there'll be one of
those machines in every town in Europe.

227
00:19:47,923 --> 00:19:50,467
Loitering in the woodshed again,
are we, Myccie?

228
00:19:50,634 --> 00:19:52,844
-Good evening, Sherly.
-Well.

229
00:19:53,012 --> 00:19:55,680
I see your bootmaker is ill, dear brother.

230
00:19:55,848 --> 00:19:59,976
As I detect that you've recently changed
the brand of soap with which you shave.

231
00:20:00,144 --> 00:20:02,353
The chimney in the front room
at Baker Street...

232
00:20:02,521 --> 00:20:04,355
...still needs a damn good sweeping up.

233
00:20:04,523 --> 00:20:08,359
Were you aware that the hackney carriage
by which you arrived had a damaged wheel?

234
00:20:08,527 --> 00:20:11,279
Yes, the left.
And it's plain to the meanest intelligence...

235
00:20:11,447 --> 00:20:14,866
...that you have recently
acquired a new bow for your violin.

236
00:20:15,034 --> 00:20:16,743
Same bow, new strings.

237
00:20:16,911 --> 00:20:20,288
And may I deduce, Mycroft--?
Good evening, by the way.

238
00:20:20,456 --> 00:20:21,706
No.

239
00:20:22,708 --> 00:20:24,751
-He doesn't.
-May I deduce that you...

240
00:20:24,919 --> 00:20:30,090
...who rarely strays from the path that runs
from your home to the Diogenes Club...

241
00:20:30,257 --> 00:20:33,843
...and never on a Monday when
they serve your favorite potted shrimps...

242
00:20:34,011 --> 00:20:38,973
...must be here for some far more important
reason than my stag party?

243
00:20:39,892 --> 00:20:45,063
You know, he's nothing like as slow-witted
as you'd been leading me to believe, Sherly.

244
00:20:45,231 --> 00:20:46,940
No, you're quite right, Dr. Watson...

245
00:20:47,108 --> 00:20:52,278
...but with all the conflict in Europe
at the moment, the whole situation could--

246
00:20:52,446 --> 00:20:54,614
Excuse me. --suddenly erupt.

247
00:20:54,782 --> 00:20:58,701
I am here to avoid a dire catastrophe.

248
00:20:58,869 --> 00:21:02,539
If the concerns of two nations...

249
00:21:02,706 --> 00:21:04,666
...which shall remain nameless...

250
00:21:04,834 --> 00:21:09,212
...but I can tell you they speak
French and German...

251
00:21:09,380 --> 00:21:12,882
...are not dealt with tonight,
I shall be forced to go to Switzerland...

252
00:21:13,050 --> 00:21:16,427
...to attend the ghastly peace summit
in Reichenbach.

253
00:21:16,595 --> 00:21:18,930
The worst thing about Switzerland
is the altitude.

254
00:21:19,098 --> 00:21:21,349
It gives me nosebleeds,
exacerbates my asthma....

255
00:21:21,517 --> 00:21:24,811
I'm so glad you invited your brother.

256
00:21:40,327 --> 00:21:41,369
This looks promising.

257
00:21:41,745 --> 00:21:43,830
WOMAN:
And your poison of choice, gentlemen?

258
00:21:43,998 --> 00:21:46,666
We'll start with the champagne.
We may need several more chairs.

259
00:21:46,834 --> 00:21:48,835
Perhaps a good cigar.

260
00:21:49,587 --> 00:21:52,630
And don't bother with the chairs.

261
00:21:53,716 --> 00:21:55,466
What is it your brother does exactly?

262
00:21:55,634 --> 00:21:58,428
He's the keeper
of the broom cupboard of state.

263
00:21:58,596 --> 00:22:00,305
No ambition, no energy...

264
00:22:00,472 --> 00:22:04,267
...yet I'm repeatedly told that he's
indispensable to the British government...

265
00:22:04,435 --> 00:22:06,060
...particularly the Foreign Office.

266
00:22:06,228 --> 00:22:08,938
-I would like to propose a toast.
-Really?

267
00:22:09,106 --> 00:22:11,983
To my dear friend, Dr. John...

268
00:22:12,985 --> 00:22:16,696
...um, Hamish Watson--

269
00:22:16,864 --> 00:22:17,906
I'm right here.

270
00:22:18,073 --> 00:22:21,659
--on the eve of his wedding. He...

271
00:22:23,704 --> 00:22:25,205
...has been the best companion.

272
00:22:25,372 --> 00:22:28,082
Shouldn't we be waiting
for the boys from my rugby club?

273
00:22:28,250 --> 00:22:30,668
He has always kept us--
They couldn't attend.

274
00:22:30,836 --> 00:22:32,795
--flat-footed on the ground.

275
00:22:32,963 --> 00:22:35,048
All of them? Hmm.
The chaps from my medical school?

276
00:22:35,216 --> 00:22:37,300
-They declined.
-The lads from the regiment?

277
00:22:37,468 --> 00:22:41,179
-No man's better worth having at your side--
-Who is it you're looking for?

278
00:22:41,347 --> 00:22:43,932
Because I don't know a single
damn person here, do I?

279
00:22:44,099 --> 00:22:46,643
There's no need for hysterics.
You know me and Mycroft.

280
00:22:46,810 --> 00:22:49,979
-Don't be a ponce, Watson.
-Ponce?

281
00:22:50,898 --> 00:22:54,317
You completely forgot about my stag party,
didn't you?

282
00:22:56,487 --> 00:22:59,155
-Why are we here?
-Your very good health, doctor.

283
00:22:59,323 --> 00:23:01,449
Shame none of your friends
could make it.

284
00:23:08,290 --> 00:23:11,960
I'm going to the gaming tables.
I refuse for this night to be a total loss.

285
00:23:12,127 --> 00:23:15,296
-Give me my money.
-Happily. Give me the wedding ring.

286
00:23:15,464 --> 00:23:18,466
So now you're interested
in being the best man.

287
00:23:18,634 --> 00:23:21,052
You're supposed to keep
the ring anyway.

288
00:23:21,220 --> 00:23:23,846
Just as you're supposed to
organize my stag party.

289
00:23:24,014 --> 00:23:26,683
-Don't want to lose it on a bet.
-And invite my friends...

290
00:23:26,850 --> 00:23:30,520
...of which, by the way, there are many.
You're the one with no friends...

291
00:23:30,688 --> 00:23:33,022
...Sherly No Mates.

292
00:23:37,152 --> 00:23:39,821
He's all "me, me, me," isn't he?

293
00:23:50,332 --> 00:23:51,541
MAN:
I win!

294
00:24:02,386 --> 00:24:04,304
WOMAN:
Please, sit.

295
00:24:04,471 --> 00:24:07,223
Put your money on the table
and we will begin.

296
00:24:13,022 --> 00:24:15,857
Welcome. I am Madam Simza.

297
00:24:20,154 --> 00:24:23,990
Cards can illuminate your past...

298
00:24:24,450 --> 00:24:27,577
...clarify your present,
and show you the future.

299
00:24:29,955 --> 00:24:33,624
If you have a specific question,
hold it in your mind.

300
00:24:33,792 --> 00:24:35,209
HOLMES:
Mm.

301
00:24:41,842 --> 00:24:44,218
I'm holding.

302
00:24:45,512 --> 00:24:47,138
Let me know when you're ready.

303
00:24:47,681 --> 00:24:49,807
Actually, I'd prefer to read...

304
00:24:50,351 --> 00:24:51,392
...your fortune.

305
00:24:56,023 --> 00:24:58,358
Temperance inverted.

306
00:24:59,401 --> 00:25:00,735
Indicative of volatility.

307
00:25:01,737 --> 00:25:04,822
A woman who has recently
taken her comfort in drink.

308
00:25:04,990 --> 00:25:08,368
From what does she seek solace?
What does she not wish to see?

309
00:25:09,995 --> 00:25:12,455
-A fool embarrassing himself?
-Hmm.

310
00:25:12,623 --> 00:25:16,000
-Hmm.
-Oh, yes. The Fool.

311
00:25:16,168 --> 00:25:20,004
Someone has been led astray, involved
in something without their knowledge.

312
00:25:20,172 --> 00:25:23,883
Not bad,
but you have to make me believe you.

313
00:25:24,051 --> 00:25:25,468
I have to see it in your eyes.

314
00:25:25,636 --> 00:25:28,346
-Right. I can do better.
-Uh-huh.

315
00:25:28,931 --> 00:25:31,516
The Two of Cups, a powerful bond.

316
00:25:31,683 --> 00:25:34,769
But between whom?
A brother and sister perhaps?

317
00:25:36,313 --> 00:25:39,148
And I see a name. Yes, it's...

318
00:25:39,441 --> 00:25:41,150
...Rene.

319
00:25:43,070 --> 00:25:44,320
What do you want?

320
00:25:44,863 --> 00:25:45,863
The Devil.

321
00:25:51,203 --> 00:25:52,578
Why are we playing this game?

322
00:26:02,464 --> 00:26:03,548
Where did you get this?

323
00:26:03,715 --> 00:26:07,969
I stole it from a woman in an auction room,
but l believe it was intended for you.

324
00:26:14,435 --> 00:26:15,518
SIM [IN FRENCH]:

325
00:26:23,944 --> 00:26:25,319
"Found my purpose in life."

326
00:26:25,487 --> 00:26:29,782
So the question I've been holding is,
what purpose is Rene fulfilling?

327
00:26:33,745 --> 00:26:35,288
[IN ENGLlSH]
Time is up.

328
00:26:35,914 --> 00:26:38,082
I have other clients.

329
00:26:43,505 --> 00:26:46,466
Though you may not have detected
the wisp of astrakhan fur...

330
00:26:46,633 --> 00:26:48,718
...snagged on a nail
over my left shoulder...

331
00:26:48,886 --> 00:26:51,762
...you couldn't have failed to notice
the overpowering aroma...

332
00:26:51,930 --> 00:26:53,890
...of herring pickled in vodka...

333
00:26:54,057 --> 00:26:56,934
...in tandem with
a truly unfortunate body odor.

334
00:26:57,102 --> 00:27:00,313
There's a man concealed
in the rafters above us.

335
00:27:00,481 --> 00:27:04,108
A Cossack, renowned for
their infeasible acrobatic abilities...

336
00:27:04,276 --> 00:27:07,737
...and are notorious for moonlighting
as assassins.

337
00:27:07,905 --> 00:27:12,116
So it's safe to presume
that your next client is here to kill you.

338

342

343

Touch of pepper.

Get up there!

358

All mine?

359
00:31:13,191 --> 00:31:14,942
Now, wait a minute.

360
00:31:47,350 --> 00:31:49,518
You're right. He did stink.

361
00:31:49,686 --> 00:31:51,520

Hey, you can run--

362
00:31:51,688 --> 00:31:53,773
Where's you?

363
00:31:56,359 --> 00:31:58,235

364
00:32:00,405 --> 00:32:01,864
-Just had a fight.
-Yes.

-Where were you?
-I'm glad to see...

366

...you're taking your best-man duties
so seriously.

367

I was on my own!
Not gonna get my monies!

368

She was biting my leg.

into that motor carriage of yours.

I've been to a wedding here before.

377

I'd expected to hear from him sooner,
in light of recent events.

380
00:35:16,101 --> 00:35:21,105
He was wondering if it'd be convenient for
you to come by the college this afternoon.

381
00:35:21,272 --> 00:35:23,440
His lecture concludes at 4.

382

Excuse me. Matthew,

388

my white tie and tails.

-I'll take care of it, professor.
-Thank you. l do apologize.

390
00:36:18,997 --> 00:36:23,000
I'm off on a blasted lecture tour.
Would you care for some tea or coffee?

391
00:36:23,168 --> 00:36:25,502
-Neither.
-Something stronger, perhaps?

392
00:36:25,670 --> 00:36:29,465
No, but might l trouble you
for an inscription?

393
00:36:47,650 --> 00:36:51,153
I read that the good doctor
was to be married today.

394
00:36:51,321 --> 00:36:52,696
How was the service?

395
00:36:52,864 --> 00:36:54,114
Definitive.

396
00:36:54,282 --> 00:36:58,410
He'll no longer be party to my investigations.
He's out of the equation.

397
00:37:00,163 --> 00:37:02,706
I trust you'll take this into consideration.

398
00:37:06,544 --> 00:37:09,630
MORIARTY: And what considerations
will you grant me?

399
00:37:17,806 --> 00:37:19,306
Have you actually read the book?

400
00:37:19,474 --> 00:37:21,642
I found it compelling...

401
00:37:21,810 --> 00:37:26,105
...though I'm primarily interested
in your more recent endeavors.

402
00:37:26,940 --> 00:37:29,733
I take that as a compliment.

403
00:37:29,901 --> 00:37:32,778
I have the utmost regard for your talents.

404
00:37:33,738 --> 00:37:37,032
It's a pleasure to finally meet you...

405
00:37:38,076 --> 00:37:39,159
...officially.

406
00:37:42,914 --> 00:37:46,083
HOLMES: Are you familiar with the study
of graphology?

407
00:37:46,417 --> 00:37:49,002
I've never given it
any serious thought, no.

408
00:37:49,170 --> 00:37:52,756
The psychological analysis
of handwriting.

409
00:37:52,924 --> 00:37:57,719
The upward strokes on the P, the J,
and the M indicate a genius-level intellect.

410
00:37:58,179 --> 00:38:00,097
While the flourishes on the lower zone...

411
00:38:00,265 --> 00:38:03,308
...denote a highly creative
yet meticulous nature.

412
00:38:03,476 --> 00:38:06,812
But if one observes the overall slant
and the pressure of the writing...

413
00:38:06,980 --> 00:38:11,441
...there's a suggestion of acute narcissism,
a complete lack of empathy...

414
00:38:11,609 --> 00:38:14,153
-...and a pronounced inclination toward--
-No.

415
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:15,737
--moral insanity.

416
00:38:16,865 --> 00:38:21,827
In answer to your previous request
regarding Dr. Watson not being involved...

417
00:38:21,995 --> 00:38:24,663
...the answer is no.

418
00:38:26,166 --> 00:38:31,670
The laws of celestial mechanics dictate
that when two objects collide...

419
00:38:32,297 --> 00:38:36,175
...there is always damage
of a collateral nature.

420

Exempli gratia.

421
00:38:40,763 --> 00:38:44,892
Two gentlemen find themselves
at cross-purposes.

422
00:38:46,644 --> 00:38:49,605
A young woman torn between them.

423
00:38:51,149 --> 00:38:54,735
The strain proves too much for her,
and she suddenly falls ill...

424
00:38:55,445 --> 00:38:59,990
...with tragic consequences.

425
00:39:02,619 --> 00:39:06,163
A rare form of tuberculosis.

426
00:39:06,331 --> 00:39:09,958
She succumbed in a matter of seconds.

427
00:39:12,879 --> 00:39:14,254
Now...

428
00:39:16,132 --> 00:39:18,634
...are you sure you want
to play this game?

429
00:39:20,261 --> 00:39:22,804
I'm afraid you'd lose.

00:39:24,724 --> 00:39:30,562
Rest assured, if you attempt
to bring destruction down upon me...

431
00:39:30,730 --> 00:39:33,023
...I shall do the same to you.

432
00:39:33,483 --> 00:39:38,737
My respect for you, Mr. Holmes,
is the only reason you're still alive.

433
00:39:40,949 --> 00:39:42,699
You've paid me several compliments.

00:39:42,867 --> 00:39:47,871
Let me pay you one in return when I say that
if I were assured of the former eventuality...

-...and the carriage is coming at 4.
-Mm.

1201
01:58:46,327 --> 01:58:48,745
It's gonna be a beautiful week
in Brighton.

1202
01:58:49,580 --> 01:58:51,414
Yes, it'll be fun.

1203
01:58:51,957 --> 01:58:53,375
I'm looking forward to it.

1204
01:58:55,544 --> 01:58:57,337
You know I miss him too...

1205
01:58:58,047 --> 01:58:59,714
...in my own way.

1206
01:59:06,889 --> 01:59:08,348
He would have wanted us to go.

1207
01:59:10,017 --> 01:59:12,852
He would have wanted to come with us.

1208
01:59:14,355 --> 01:59:16,689
When's Mrs. Hudson
coming for Gladstone?

1209
01:59:16,857 --> 01:59:19,067
Oh, soon.

1210
01:59:21,153 --> 01:59:22,779
Three o'clock.

1211
01:59:49,085 --> 01:59:50,544
Mary?

1212
01:59:52,171 --> 01:59:54,256
Who delivered this parcel?

1213
01:59:54,424 --> 01:59:56,383
MARY:
The postman.

1214
01:59:57,802 --> 02:00:00,095
WATSON:
The usual chap or...

1215
02:00:00,263 --> 02:00:03,307
...did he look peculiar?
