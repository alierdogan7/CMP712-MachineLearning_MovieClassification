Then one of your robots comes in
and makes a better chair twice as fast.

A robot cannot harm a human being.
The first law of robotics.

246
00:19:40,825 --> 00:19:45,663
Yes, I've seen your commercials. But the
second law states a robot must obey...

247
00:19:45,914 --> 00:19:49,667
...any order given by a human being.
What if it was told to kill?

248

Impossible. It would conflict
with the first law.

249

Right, but the third law states a robot can defend itself.

SONNY: Can you?

378

SPOONER: You murdered him because he was
teaching you to simulate emotions...

379

...and things got out of control.

380

SONNY: I did not murder him.

381
00:30:09,036 --> 00:30:12,540

a useful simulation for a robot.

- Maybe I was wrong.

My attorneys filed a brief with the DA.

405
00:31:53,098 --> 00:31:56,352
He assures me a robot cannot be charged with homicide.

406
00:31:56,685 --> 00:32:00,856
The brief confirms murder can only be
committed when one human kills another.

407
00:32:01,065 --> 00:32:05,903
Detective, you're not suggesting
this robot be treated as human, are you?

408
00:32:06,570 --> 00:32:09,865
Granted, we can't rule out the robot's proximity...

409
00:32:10,074 --> 00:32:14,078

My logic is undeniable.

1187
01:39:47,419 --> 01:39:51,798
My logic is undeniable.

1189
01:40:30,086 --> 01:40:31,463
Can we be of service?

(DETECTIVE COUGHING)

1191
01:40:42,182 --> 01:40:43,683
BALDEZ:
Chief?

1192
01:40:49,481 --> 01:40:53,818
Because he is at my right hand, I shall not be moved.

1193
01:40:57,572 --> 01:40:59,574
How may I be of service?

1194
01:41:01,409 --> 01:41:02,744
Sonny!

1195
01:41:04,370 --> 01:41:05,872
Yes, detective?

1196
01:41:06,498 --> 01:41:08,833
Calvin's fine! Save me!

1197
01:41:11,503 --> 01:41:16,216
<i>MAN: (ON SPEAKER)

<i>All NS-5s, report for service

1199

<i>All NS-5s, report for service

1200
01:41:55,380 --> 01:41:59,050
CALVIN: One thing bothers me.
Alfred was V.I.K.I.'s prisoner.

1201
01:41:59,259 --> 01:42:01,344
I don't understand why she would kill him.

1202
01:42:01,511 --> 01:42:03,680
She wouldn't want police snooping around.

1203
01:42:03,847 --> 01:42:05,265
That's true.

1204
01:42:06,182 --> 01:42:08,893
But then V.I.K.I. didn't kill the old man.

1205
01:42:10,270 --> 01:42:11,729
Did she, Sonny?

1206
01:42:15,567 --> 01:42:17,277
No.

1207
01:42:17,443 --> 01:42:20,113
He said I had to promise.

1208
01:42:21,072 --> 01:42:23,408
Promise to do one favor for him.

1209
01:42:23,783 --> 01:42:28,413
He made me swear before he'd tell me
what it is he wanted me to do.

1210
01:42:30,957 --> 01:42:32,792
He made me swear.

1211
01:42:34,169 --> 01:42:35,920
Then he told you to kill him.

1212
01:42:38,298 --> 01:42:40,842
He said it was what I was made for.

1213
01:42:41,092 --> 01:42:44,179
His suicide was the only message he could send to you.

1214
01:42:44,429 --> 01:42:46,556
The first bread crumb.

1215
01:42:46,723 --> 01:42:49,517
The only thing V.I.K.I. couldn't control.

1216
01:42:49,809 --> 01:42:53,438
Lanning was counting on my prejudice
to lead me right to you.

1217
01:42:53,813 --> 01:42:55,982
Are you going to arrest me, detective?

1218
01:43:00,945 --> 01:43:04,782
Well, the DA defines murder as one human killing another...

1219
01:43:04,949 --> 01:43:08,077
...so technically, you can't commit murder, can you?

1220
01:43:08,828 --> 01:43:10,330
Does this...

1221
01:43:10,496 --> 01:43:11,998
...make us friends?

1222
01:43:30,850 --> 01:43:33,186
Something up here after all.

1223
01:43:33,853 --> 01:43:35,855

- You.

1228
01:43:55,041 --> 01:43:57,168

01:43:57,502 --> 01:44:01,005

like the rest of us, Sonny.</i>

1230
01:44:01,172 --> 01:44:04,175

would have wanted.</i>
