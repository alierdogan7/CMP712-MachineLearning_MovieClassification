I might get into a spot

499
00:48:45,322 --> 00:48:49,850
- I didn't think you were this twisted.
- Twisted? This is kid stuff.

500
00:48:49,960 --> 00:48:52,588
We got a call. Somebody thought
there was some trouble here.

501
00:48:52,696 --> 00:48:55,256
Oh, the boys were having
some trouble with their makeup.

502
00:48:55,365 --> 00:49:00,234
Joey P. Brenner. You turn up
in the most damnedest places.

503
00:49:00,337 --> 00:49:02,737
Trying to learn
my way around.

504
00:49:02,839 --> 00:49:06,707
Well, you got a good guide if you wanna
know your way around a sewer.

- Where do you know that cop from?
- Oh, he broke up a fight I had in an alley...

507
00:49:14,084 --> 00:49:17,542
the night you sent your three assholes
to take me apart.

<i>working for Patrovita.</i>

510
00:49:27,331 --> 00:49:31,734
- I don't want his name. I want his ass.
- I'll see to it he disappears.

511
00:49:33,537 --> 00:49:36,472
First you bust him up real good,
public and messy.

512
00:49:36,573 --> 00:49:39,440
Everybody should know what you get
when you kick in my door.

Shit, I hate this game.

515
00:49:46,817 --> 00:49:50,309
This looks like
it's going to be fun.

516
00:49:50,420 --> 00:49:53,787
- That'd be different.
- Why? He's not a good host?

517
00:49:53,890 --> 00:49:56,791
Some of his friends
can be a pain in the neck.

518
00:49:56,893 --> 00:49:59,157
Hey, you're with
the main man.

519

- Wear that one.
- Beautiful, beautiful. Give it some sparkle.

- Such a pretty dress.
- Oh, like this? [Giggling]

522
00:50:21,451 --> 00:50:23,351
Joey.

523
00:50:23,453 --> 00:50:25,717
I was hoping
you could make it.

525
00:50:27,824 --> 00:50:30,156
- Quite a party.
- Party?

526
00:50:30,260 --> 00:50:33,058
This is just a simple gathering
of the immediate family.

Luigi's parties
have to be held outdoors.

528

He wants to meet you.

having too much fun.

- I'll get you a nice eight by ten.
- Keep it. I'm not sentimental.

535
00:51:06,630 --> 00:51:08,564

- Joey Brenner, Luigi Patrovita.
- My pleasure.

You like getting close
to our friend?

You want the job
done right, don't you?

- What have you found out?
- Nothing.

542
00:51:42,199 --> 00:51:44,326
I want you.

We tried that,
remember?

544
00:51:46,536 --> 00:51:49,994
You come home with me,
and you owe nobody nothing.

545
00:51:50,107 --> 00:51:52,598
I'll owe you,
won't I?

546
00:51:52,709 --> 00:51:56,941
Mr. Rocca thinks you would make
a won'thwhile addition...

547
00:51:57,047 --> 00:52:01,279
- to our various endeavors.
- I like to think so.

From what we know,
you don't stay anyplace too long.

551
00:52:11,695 --> 00:52:15,358
If you're not part of an organization
that can protect you...

552
00:52:15,465 --> 00:52:20,459
- moving around is the next best thing.
- He's looking for a home.

00:52:22,672 --> 00:52:25,869
You kill anybody, Joey?

554
00:52:25,976 --> 00:52:27,944
Yeah.

00:52:31,047 --> 00:52:33,743

Smart-ass, I don't.

00:52:56,606 --> 00:53:00,906
All right. Forget it. Go back to the party.
I want to talk to Mr. Rocca.

560
00:53:03,580 --> 00:53:05,548
Nice meeting you.

561
00:53:13,423 --> 00:53:15,391
I don't know.

562
00:53:20,163 --> 00:53:23,132
You don't let him in
too far too fast.

563
00:53:23,233 --> 00:53:26,134
Give him a little time
to impress us.

564
00:53:26,236 --> 00:53:31,139
If he doesn't, we'll use him for
something dirty and dump him in the pit.

Cute, huh?

What a doll.

567
00:53:47,123 --> 00:53:50,581
Yes, I think it would accessorize
the outfit beautifully.

568
00:53:52,329 --> 00:53:55,389
What do you think?
Does it make you drool?

569
00:53:55,498 --> 00:53:59,457
I would have picked exactly
the same one. That is my taste.

570
00:53:59,569 --> 00:54:02,470
Yeah? Do you like
this one better?

571
00:54:02,572 --> 00:54:06,941
- What do you think?
Which one do you like better?
- Try it on.

572
00:54:07,043 --> 00:54:09,409
- You don't mind sitting here?
- No. I like it.

573
00:54:09,512 --> 00:54:12,640
- Okay. All right. I'll see you later.
- Bye.

00:54:12,749 --> 00:54:15,217
All right.

00:54:20,357 --> 00:54:24,418
- Well, this goes with the color. It's beautiful.
- Something in red?

Why don't you just pick one?
I'll never make up my mind.

579
00:54:36,039 --> 00:54:39,531
- Why don't you take them both?
- I can't afford them both.

580
00:54:41,645 --> 00:54:43,613
I can.

00:54:43,713 --> 00:54:47,012
Oh. You do that
too easy.

- No. Not in a long time.
- Kiss her good-bye, shithead.
