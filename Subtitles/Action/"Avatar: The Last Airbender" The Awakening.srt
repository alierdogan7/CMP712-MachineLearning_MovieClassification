could stop them.

needed him most, he vanished.

airbending skills are great

Yes, sokka's plan.

We won't be able to mount
a massive invasion without
the earth king's armies

136
00:07:50,437 --> 00:07:53,772
But the solar eclipse
will still leave
the fire nation vulnerable.

a smaller invasion.

the eclipse isn't even
our biggest advantage.

What?

179
00:09:55,228 --> 00:09:57,262
Why doesn't anyone
ever tell me anything?

180
00:09:57,364 --> 00:09:58,664
Something's not right.

181
00:09:58,765 --> 00:10:00,065
They should've known that.

182
00:10:00,166 --> 00:10:02,601
I think this is a captured ship.

183
00:10:02,702 --> 00:10:05,337
Just stay quiet until
we're safely across the ramp.

184
00:10:05,438 --> 00:10:07,740
Then we'll sink this ship.

185
00:10:07,841 --> 00:10:11,844

190
00:10:43,410 --> 00:10:45,444
You seem so downcast.

191
00:10:45,545 --> 00:10:47,112
Has mai gotten to you already?

192
00:10:47,213 --> 00:10:50,816
Though actually, mai has been in
a strangely good mood lately.

193
00:10:50,917 --> 00:10:52,718
I haven't seen dad yet.

194
00:10:52,819 --> 00:10:56,455
I haven't seen him
in three years,
since i was banished.

Azula: so what?

196
00:10:57,691 --> 00:10:59,958
So, i didn't capture the avatar.

197
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:01,193
Who cares?

198
00:11:01,294 --> 00:11:04,930
The avatar's dead.

199
00:11:05,031 --> 00:11:09,868
Unless you think he somehow
miraculously survived.

200
00:11:09,969 --> 00:11:13,972
This is water from
the spirit oasis
at the north pole.

201
00:11:14,074 --> 00:11:18,644
It has special properties,
so i've been saving it
for something important.

202
00:11:18,745 --> 00:11:20,779
No.

203
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:25,851
There's no way
he could've survived.

204
00:11:27,387 --> 00:11:33,359
Well, then i'm sure you
have nothing to worry about.

I'm gonna give us some cover.

I can't just stand by
and do nothing.

209

Aang, no!

210
00:12:55,675 --> 00:12:58,610
You're still hurt,
and you have to stay secret.

211
00:12:58,712 --> 00:13:01,013
Just let us handle this.

212
00:13:01,114 --> 00:13:04,016
Fine.

213
00:13:12,592 --> 00:13:14,293
Katara: how we doing?

214
00:13:14,394 --> 00:13:17,262

You make it too easy.

[Stomach grumbling]

00:13:55,301 --> 00:13:57,569
Well, i am pretty hungry.

223
00:13:57,671 --> 00:13:59,238
Maybe dinner's a good idea.

224
00:13:59,339 --> 00:14:01,040
Here, tie this around your head.

225
00:14:01,141 --> 00:14:03,242
It'll cover your arrow.

226
00:14:03,343 --> 00:14:06,412
I'm not going out if
i can't wear my arrow proudly.

227

Aang, come on.

228
00:14:07,681 --> 00:14:08,614
Be practical.

You guys go ahead without us.

We'll catch up with you.

I think i understand why being
a secret bothers you so much.

232
00:14:18,525 --> 00:14:19,958
You don't want people
to think you failed.

233
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:21,694
You're right, i don't.

234
00:14:21,795 --> 00:14:24,096
But the problem is, i did fail.

00:14:26,599 --> 00:14:28,067
It is true.

I was there, but i lost.

And now, the earth kingdom
has fallen for good.

240
00:14:35,475 --> 00:14:37,343
It's not for good.

241
00:14:37,444 --> 00:14:39,111
Remember, there's still a plan.

242
00:14:39,212 --> 00:14:40,045
The invasion.

243
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:41,780
And i hate
the invasion plan, too.

I don't want you or anyone else
risking your lives
to fix my mistakes.

I've always known that i would
have to face the fire lord

to do it alone.

Aang.

266
00:16:38,765 --> 00:16:41,166
He just took his glider
and disappeared.

267
00:16:41,267 --> 00:16:45,170
He has this ridiculous notion
that he has to save
the world alone

268
00:16:45,271 --> 00:16:47,106
That it's all
his responsibility.

269
00:16:47,207 --> 00:16:49,708
Maybe that's his way
of being brave.

270

It's not brave.

271
00:16:50,543 --> 00:16:52,544

We could be helping him,
and i know the world needs him

But doesn't he know how much
that we need him too?

leave us behind?

aren't you?

were just so lost without you.

that you had to go,
so why do i still feel this way?

i was gone, and every night
when i went to sleep

I am proud because,
when your loyalty was tested
by your treacherous uncle

You did the right thing
and captured the traitor

of all of your most
legendary accomplishment.

amazed and impressed

You're going to have to be
a little more specific.

Why did you tell father
that i was the one
who killed the avatar?

until morning?

Fine.

309
00:19:39,779 --> 00:19:43,248
You seemed so worried
about how father would treat you

310
00:19:43,350 --> 00:19:45,184
Because you hadn't captured
the avatar.

311
00:19:45,285 --> 00:19:49,021
I figured, if i gave you
the credit, you'd have nothing
to worry about.

You have another motive
for doing this.

I just haven't figured out
what it is.

Please, zuko.

320
00:20:06,373 --> 00:20:08,774
What ulterior motive
could i have?

321
00:20:08,875 --> 00:20:13,645
What could i possibly gain
by letting you get all the glory
for defeating the avatar?

322
00:20:13,747 --> 00:20:17,883
Unless, somehow,
the avatar was actually alive.

323
00:20:17,984 --> 00:20:23,255
All that glory would suddenly
turn to shame and foolishness.

324

But you said yourself,
that was impossible.

But everyone thinks
i'm dead again.

and i'm losing this war.

for the state of the world,
it is me.

this war coming,
and prevented it.

but you'll have our help.

you could get out of training

the fire nation, did you?

00:23:05,018 --> 00:23:08,987
We'll join up with my dad
and the invasion force on
the day of the eclipse.

356
00:23:09,089 --> 00:23:11,156
Hey, what's...?

357
00:23:11,257 --> 00:23:15,094
Oh, it's your glider.

358
00:23:15,195 --> 00:23:16,295
That's ok.

359
00:23:16,329 --> 00:23:21,367
If someone saw it,
it would give away my identity.

360
00:23:21,468 --> 00:23:27,439
It's better for now
that no one knows i'm alive.
