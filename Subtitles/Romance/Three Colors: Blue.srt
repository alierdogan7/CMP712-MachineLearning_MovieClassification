1
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:45,480
THREE COLOURS
BLUE

2
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:03,640
Come on, Anne.

3
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:07,640
Get in.

4
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:59,680
Are you able to talk?

5
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:07,680
During the...Were you conscious?

6
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:16,560
I'm sorry to have to inform you...
Do you know?

7
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,680
Your husband died in the accident.

8
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:34,600
But you weren't conscious
all that time.

9
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:37,720
Anne?

10
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:42,720
Yes, your daughter too.

11
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:13,720
Is someone there? Who did it?

12
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:26,600
Mr. Leroy?

13
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:31,600
Please call the guards. Somebody
broke a window on the 1st floor.

14
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:39,720
I'll look in the garden.

15
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:36,760
I can't do that.

16
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:45,760
- I broke the window.
- Don't worry.

17
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,480
We'll replace it.

18
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:56,760
- I am sorry.
- Don't worry.

19
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:58,680
- Is it today?
- This afternoon. At 17.00.

20
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:03,800
Can I do anything for you?

21
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:23,720
We gathered to pay respects

22
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:26,840
to the memory of the man

23
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:30,840
and composer,

24
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:34,720
known as one of the
most outstanding in the world.

25
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:40,720
Nobody can accept

26
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:41,840
that he is gone.

27
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:47,760
We also mourn his 5 year-old
daughter.

28
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:50,880
Who died by his side.

29
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:57,880
Patrice, millions of men
and women

30
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:04,760
awaited the music you composed

31
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:07,760
for the Unification of Europe,

32
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:12,760
which we all hope to
celebrate soon.

33
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:07,920
Good morning.

34
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:20,920
Good morning.

35
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:27,800
- I know you don't want to see me.
- Right.

36
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:32,800
- Can I come in?
- No.

37
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:37,800
Julie, I don't want an interview.

38
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:42,800
- What then?
- I'm writing an article about your husband.

39
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:48,800
- I need to know something.
- About what?

40
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:52,800
The concert
for the Unification of Europe.

41
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:57,800
- It doesn't exist.
- You've changed.

42
00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:01,800
- You were not so rude before.
- Haven't you heard?

43
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:06,800
I lost in my daughter and
husband in an accident.

44
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:12,800
Is it true you wrote
your husband's music?

45
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,960
Good morning.

46
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:59,960
Bernard!

47
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:05,360
- Good morning madam.
- Did you do what I asked?

48
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:07,840
- Did you clear the blue room?
- Everything.

49
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:12,840
Madam, we're all deeply sorry.

50
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:36,000
Marie?

51
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:45,000
Why are you crying?

52
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:49,960
Because you're not.

53
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:57,040
I keep thinking about them.

54
00:14:57,960 --> 00:15:00,040
I remember everything.

55
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:04,040
How can I forget?

56
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:06,920
- no thanks.

57
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:14,040
- Lets sit down.
This could take a while.

58
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:20,040
- I'll be right back.

59
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,080
Nobody must know about it.

60
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:12,960
You will pay for my mother's
rest home for the rest of her life.

61
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:18,960
You will take care of
Marie and the gardener.

62
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,080
You will sell all our property

63
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,960
and pay all the money
in one account.

64
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:30,000
- 27-0641-196?
- Yes.

65
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:33,080
May I ask why?

66
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:37,080
No.

67
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:40,080
Would you excuse me.

68
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:54,000
- But what will you have left?
- My own account.

69
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:10,200
I haven't started yet.

70
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:17,080
- I put it aside...
- The day I left?
- Yes

71
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:24,080
Here it is. I was waiting
to hear from you.

72
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:26,200
You were right.

73
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:38,200
A lot of corrections.

74
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:41,200
No more than usual.

75
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:46,720
It's beautiful.

76
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:51,200
I love this chorus.

77
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:04,280
It's Julie. Do you love me?

78
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:09,160
- Yes.
- Since when?

79
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:12,160
Since I started working with
Patrice.

80
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:17,160
- Do you think of me?
- Yes.

81
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:19,160
Come if you want to.

82
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:23,160
- Now?
- Yes. now. Right away.

83
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:28,160
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

84
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:08,320
Olivier?

85
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:24,200
- I fell.
- Please take it off.

86
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:36,320
The rest too.

87
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:49,240
They took everything.
Only the matress is left.

88
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:25,360
I appreciate what you did for me.

89
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:33,280
But you see I'm like others.
I sweat, cough.

90
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:34,400
I have cavities.

91
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:42,280
You won't miss me.
You understand that now.

92
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:50,400
Shut the door when you leave.

93
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:09,400
Julie!

94
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:26,320
I don't want any children
in the building.

95
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:28,440
Let me ask you something.
It may help.

96
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:31,040
- What do you do?
- Nothing.

97
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:35,040
- I mean, for a living?
- Nothing.

98
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:46,320
I have what you are looking for.
But the apartment needs repairing.
It may take a while.

99
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:53,320
- Can I live there now?
- Sure. It needs a quick paint.

100
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:57,320
- Can I look see it now?
- Yes.

101
00:28:57,880 --> 00:29:02,320
- What is your name?
- Julie de Courcy, with a "Y".

102
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:09,360
Sorry, Julie Vignon.I am
going back to my maiden name.

103
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:09,400
- Coffee and ice cream?
- As usual.

104
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:52,640
Is anybody there?

105
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:00,640
Is anybody there?

106
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:07,800
- I'm sorry for the noise. I've almost finished
- I haven't heard anything.

107
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:10,760
Can I come in?

108
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:16,640
I heard you got locked out
last week.

109
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:19,640
Your husband lent me a blanket.
I spent the night in the stairwell.

110
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:21,760
I wanted you to sign this.

111
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:25,640
- What is it?
- Everyone has signed already.

112
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:32,640
We don't want loose women in our building.
The young woman downstairs...

113
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:36,640
- I don't want to get involved.
- She is a whore.

114
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:41,760
I don't care.

115
00:39:56,640 --> 00:40:01,640
You are in perfect health.
Everything is fine.

116
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:06,800
You are in good spirits.

117
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:15,640
- Hello, it's Antoine.
- It is for you.

118
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:20,640
My name is Antoine.
You don't know me...

119
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:21,640
No I don't. Excuse me.

120
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:25,640
- Who is it?
- Some boy.

121
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:29,640
He has been looking for you.
I said he could call.

122
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:34,640
- Lets meet. It's important.
- Nothing is important.

123
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:39,640
- It is about an object.
- What?

124
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:43,840
A necklace with a cross.

125
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:07,840
I'd forgotten about it.

126
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:11,840
I found it near the car.

127
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:19,640
I couldn't keep it.
That's stealing.

128
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:25,640
If you want to ask me something,
I got there just after...

129
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:27,840
No.

130
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:42,840
I'm sorry.

131
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:49,640
I wanted to return the necklace...

132
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:54,640
- I wanted to ask you something too.
- Yes?

133
00:41:55,760 --> 00:42:00,760
When I opened the door...
your husband was still alive.

134
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:05,760
He said...

135
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:07,760
I don't understand.

136
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:10,880
He said "Now try coughing."

137
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:34,880
He was telling us a joke.

138
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:40,760
It's about a woman who can't stop
coughing. She sees a doctor.

139
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:46,760
He examined her and gave her a pill.
She swallowed it.

140
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:49,760
And asked "What was it?"

141
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:51,880
"The most powerful laxative".

142
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:57,760
"A laxative for a cough?"

143
00:42:57,800 --> 00:43:02,760
"Yes. Try coughing now."

144
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:04,880
It made us laugh.

145
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:10,760
Then the car crashed.

146
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:19,800
My husband always liked
to repeat the punch line.

147
00:43:19,840 --> 00:43:21,920
You returned it.

148
00:43:24,440 --> 00:43:26,400
It is yours.

149
00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:43,960
Are you sick?

150
00:44:49,880 --> 00:44:51,960
Are you ok?

151
00:45:01,880 --> 00:45:06,840
- You always gotta hold onto something.
- What did you say?

152
00:45:35,880 --> 00:45:37,840
Thank you.

153
00:45:37,880 --> 00:45:41,840
- For what?
- I'm staying.

154
00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:42,840
In order to throw me away,

155
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:45,840
they had to collect signatures
of all occupants.

156
00:45:49,880 --> 00:45:51,960
Your place is nice.

157
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:05,880
When I was a little girl,
I had a lamp like this.

158
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:10,880
I'd stand under it
and stretch out my hand.

159
00:46:10,920 --> 00:46:13,880
I wanted to jump
and touch it.

160
00:46:20,920 --> 00:46:23,000
I forgot all about it.

161
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:29,480
Where did you find it?

162
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:32,000
I found it.

163
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:35,000
Souvenir?

164
00:46:36,920 --> 00:46:39,000
Do you live here alone?

165
00:46:40,440 --> 00:46:41,880
Yes.

166
00:46:42,920 --> 00:46:45,000
I could never spend
a night alone.

167
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:54,880
Something must have happened.
You are not the type someone dumps.

168
00:47:10,440 --> 00:47:12,040
Forgive me, I talk too much.

169
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:25,040
Poor guy.

170
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:29,920
- Who?
- He was asleep there last night.

171
00:47:29,960 --> 00:47:32,040
He's gone now but left the flute.

172
00:47:43,960 --> 00:47:46,040
Julie?

173
00:47:51,960 --> 00:47:54,040
A coffee.

174
00:48:01,960 --> 00:48:04,040
I searched everywhere.

175
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:07,040
And I found you.

176
00:48:09,560 --> 00:48:11,040
Nobody knows where I live.

177
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:15,040
It took a few months.
Then I got lucky.

178
00:48:15,960 --> 00:48:18,920
My cleaning lady's daughter
saw you in the area.

179
00:48:21,520 --> 00:48:24,000
- I've come here ever since.
- Do you spy me?

180
00:48:26,760 --> 00:48:28,360
I miss you.

181
00:48:36,560 --> 00:48:37,560
Did you run away?

182
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:44,080
From me?

183
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,080
Do you hear what he is playing?

184
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:46,000
- It sounds like...
- Yes.

185
00:49:50,040 --> 00:49:55,000
I've seen you. Maybe that will
do for now.

186
00:49:57,040 --> 00:49:59,120
I'll try.

187
00:50:23,040 --> 00:50:28,000
- How do you know this music?
- I invent lots of things. I like to play.

188
00:52:00,080 --> 00:52:02,160
Just a second.

189
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:04,040
A problem with your place?

190
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:06,040
No. I would like another one
like this.

191
00:52:08,080 --> 00:52:12,040
- I can manage that but  it will take time.
- How long?

192
00:52:13,080 --> 00:52:15,160
2-3 months.

193
00:52:17,600 --> 00:52:19,160
You cut yourself.

194
00:52:23,120 --> 00:52:25,200
My cat scratched me.

195
00:53:43,160 --> 00:53:45,240
Mom?

196
00:53:47,160 --> 00:53:49,240
Marie-France.

197
00:53:52,160 --> 00:53:54,240
It's me. Julie.

198
00:53:59,160 --> 00:54:01,240
Come to me.

199
00:54:12,160 --> 00:54:17,120
I've heard you are dead.
You seem fine.

200
00:54:19,160 --> 00:54:21,120
Very young.

201
00:54:21,160 --> 00:54:26,120
You were always younger,
you look 30 now.

202
00:54:27,160 --> 00:54:32,120
I'm not your sister,
but daughter. I'm 33.

203
00:54:32,160 --> 00:54:34,120
I know.

204
00:54:34,160 --> 00:54:35,120
I was kidding.

205
00:54:35,160 --> 00:54:40,120
I have everything here.
The TV...

206
00:54:42,160 --> 00:54:44,240
I see the entire world.

207
00:54:47,160 --> 00:54:52,120
- Do you watch too?
- No.

208
00:55:00,200 --> 00:55:05,160
Tell me about your house,
husband...

209
00:55:05,200 --> 00:55:07,280
children...

210
00:55:08,200 --> 00:55:13,160
- Or about you?
- Mom...

211
00:55:17,200 --> 00:55:22,160
My husband and daughter are dead.
I have no home anymore.

212
00:55:23,200 --> 00:55:25,280
I heard about it.

213
00:55:34,200 --> 00:55:39,160
I was happy before.
I loved them and they loved me.

214
00:55:43,200 --> 00:55:45,280
Mom, are you listening to me?

215
00:55:48,200 --> 00:55:50,280
I am listening to, Marie-France.

216
00:55:55,200 --> 00:55:57,280
Now I have only one thing
left to do:

217
00:55:58,200 --> 00:56:00,280
Nothing.

218
00:56:03,200 --> 00:56:08,160
I don't want anymore friends,
belongings, love. Those are all traps.

219
00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:14,200
Do you have money, my child?
To get by?

220
00:56:14,240 --> 00:56:17,200
- Yes I have enough.
- That's important.

221
00:56:17,240 --> 00:56:18,320
You can't give up everything.

222
00:56:23,240 --> 00:56:26,200
- Mom?
- Yes?

223
00:56:28,240 --> 00:56:31,200
Was I afraid of mice
during my child days?

224
00:56:32,240 --> 00:56:34,320
You weren't.

225
00:56:35,240 --> 00:56:37,320
Julie was afraid.

226
00:56:38,240 --> 00:56:40,320
I'm afraid now.

227
00:56:45,240 --> 00:56:47,320
Thank you.

228
00:58:26,280 --> 00:58:30,240
- Nice to see you. Come in.
- Can I ask you something?

229
00:58:30,280 --> 00:58:35,240
- My wife is out. Please come in.
- Can you lend me your cat?

230
00:58:36,280 --> 00:58:41,240
- Excuse me?
- Cat. For a few days.

231
00:58:42,280 --> 00:58:45,240
It is not castrated.
It can be aggressive.

232
00:58:56,320 --> 00:58:58,000
I am not sure it likes you.

233
00:59:40,320 --> 00:59:44,280
- What are you doing here?
- I saw you from the bus.

234
00:59:45,320 --> 00:59:46,400
You were running like crazy.
Are you crying?

235
00:59:58,240 --> 00:59:59,280
It is the water.

236
01:00:00,320 --> 01:00:05,280
- You don't wear underwear?
- Never.

237
01:00:11,360 --> 01:00:16,320
I borrowed the cat from the neighbour,
to kill the mice. It had babies.

238
01:00:18,360 --> 01:00:20,440
It's normal, Julie.
Are you afraid to go back?

239
01:00:25,360 --> 01:00:27,440
I'll go clean up.

240
01:00:36,360 --> 01:00:38,440
I'll see you at my place.

241
01:01:05,360 --> 01:01:10,320
It's Lucille. Take a taxi here.
I will pay you back.

242
01:01:11,360 --> 01:01:16,320
- Now? It is late.
- 23.30. You have 25 minutes. It's important.

243
01:01:17,360 --> 01:01:18,320
I can't.

244
01:01:18,360 --> 01:01:21,360
I beg you. I never asked you
for anything. Please come.

245
01:01:22,360 --> 01:01:24,480
Where?

246
01:01:25,400 --> 01:01:28,360
Cita de Midi 3. Near Pigalle.
First door on the left. There's a buzzer.

247
01:01:28,400 --> 01:01:30,960
Say it's for me. You'll come?

248
01:01:49,400 --> 01:01:51,480
I am here for Lucille.

249
01:02:30,400 --> 01:02:32,480
You came.

250
01:02:37,400 --> 01:02:39,480
Forgive me.

251
01:02:42,400 --> 01:02:44,520
I'm sorry.

252
01:02:51,440 --> 01:02:56,400
- Are you angry?
- No.

253
01:02:58,440 --> 01:03:01,400
We are on in 5 minutes.
Get me ready.

254
01:03:05,440 --> 01:03:08,400
After I changed,
I came here for a drink.

255
01:03:08,440 --> 01:03:10,520
I looked around the audience,
for no reason.

256
01:03:13,440 --> 01:03:18,400
In the middle... of the first
row, I saw my father.

257
01:03:22,440 --> 01:03:24,520
He seemed tired.

258
01:03:26,440 --> 01:03:28,400
And sleepy.

259
01:03:29,440 --> 01:03:31,520
But he was starring a girl's ass.

260
01:03:32,440 --> 01:03:36,400
the shithead who let you in
wouldn't make him leave.

261
01:03:37,440 --> 01:03:41,400
He told me, that if he pays,
he has a right to watch.

262
01:03:43,440 --> 01:03:45,400
I didn't know who I could count on.

263
01:03:45,440 --> 01:03:48,520
I was desperate.
I didn't know who to talk to.

264
01:03:51,440 --> 01:03:53,400
- That's why I phoned you.
- And your father?

265
01:03:55,440 --> 01:03:59,440
10 minutes ago, he looked at
his watch and left.

266
01:04:02,480 --> 01:04:06,440
At 23.45 is the last train
to Montpellier.

267
01:04:07,480 --> 01:04:09,560
Why do you do this?

268
01:04:11,480 --> 01:04:13,560
Because I like to.

269
01:04:14,480 --> 01:04:16,560
I think everybody likes to.

270
01:04:22,480 --> 01:04:25,440
- You saved my life.
- I didn't do anything.

271
01:04:25,480 --> 01:04:30,440
- I asked you to come and you did.
- No.

272
01:04:33,480 --> 01:04:35,560
Julie...

273
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:38,080
Isn't that you?

274
01:04:41,480 --> 01:04:43,040
Lucille, we are on.

275
01:04:43,680 --> 01:04:45,560
It's me.

276
01:04:46,480 --> 01:04:48,560
European Council proposes you

277
01:04:49,480 --> 01:04:54,440
to finish the composition of
Patrice De Courcy.

278
01:04:55,480 --> 01:04:57,560
I agreed. I am working on it now.

279
01:04:58,480 --> 01:05:03,440
I'm trying to understand
Patrice. It's not easy.

280
01:05:03,480 --> 01:05:05,560
Can you tell something

281
01:05:06,480 --> 01:05:11,440
about this score, shown here
for the very first time?

282
01:05:12,480 --> 01:05:15,440
It's the first part of the concert
Patrice composed,

283
01:05:15,480 --> 01:05:17,600
commisssioned by
the European Council.

284
01:05:19,520 --> 01:05:24,480
The concert was to be played
just once

285
01:05:24,520 --> 01:05:29,480
by twelve symphonic orchestras
in the 12 EU cities.

286
01:05:29,520 --> 01:05:31,600
Patrice was a secretive man.

287
01:05:34,520 --> 01:05:39,480
Only his wife, Julie, would
understand him.

288
01:05:40,520 --> 01:05:43,480
I tried asking her to participate
in this program, but

289
01:05:43,520 --> 01:05:45,600
she refused.

290
01:05:46,520 --> 01:05:51,480
I assume that these documents
are from your archives.

291
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:53,000
No, they are not archives.
Who can predict...?

292
01:05:55,040 --> 01:05:58,480
They are photos and documents which
I found in his desk at the Conservatory.

293
01:05:59,520 --> 01:06:01,600
His wife didn't want them.

294
01:06:02,520 --> 01:06:04,480
I am not sure
I should show them.

295
01:06:07,520 --> 01:06:10,480
He was a great man. One of the
most important composers of our time.

296
01:06:13,520 --> 01:06:18,480
People like him belong to everybody.

297
01:06:51,560 --> 01:06:53,640
I'll be five minutes.

298
01:06:58,560 --> 01:07:03,520
Where did I put it?
A green calling card.

299
01:07:04,560 --> 01:07:09,520
- Did you watch TV today?
- No.

300
01:07:10,560 --> 01:07:14,520
I found it. Her number at home
and at work.

301
01:07:14,560 --> 01:07:16,640
Why do you need this?

302
01:07:18,560 --> 01:07:23,520
Today, on TV, she showed the
scores I took from you.

303
01:07:29,560 --> 01:07:33,520
After the accident, when
nothing was sure, I made a copy.

304
01:07:33,560 --> 01:07:38,520
When you picked it up,
I knew you'd destroy it.

305
01:07:38,560 --> 01:07:43,520
- I kept the copy and sent it to Strasbourg.
- Why did you do that?

306
01:07:44,560 --> 01:07:48,520
The music is so beautiful.
You can't destroy things like that.

307
01:08:10,600 --> 01:08:12,680
Olivier!

308
01:08:30,600 --> 01:08:32,560
I'm sorry.

309
01:08:32,600 --> 01:08:34,680
It's nothing.

310
01:08:36,600 --> 01:08:40,560
- I heard you're finishing Patrice's concert.
- I thought I could try...

311
01:08:40,600 --> 01:08:44,560
You can't.
You have no right. It won't be the same.

312
01:08:44,600 --> 01:08:49,560
I said I'd try.
I don't know if I'll finish.

313
01:08:49,600 --> 01:08:54,560
I'll tell you why. It was a way...
that's what I thought, to make you cry, run.

314
01:08:57,600 --> 01:08:59,680
The only way of making you say,
"I want" or "I don't want".

315
01:09:02,600 --> 01:09:05,600
- It's not fair.
- You didn't leave me any choice.

316
01:09:13,640 --> 01:09:17,600
- You have no right to.
- You want to see what I've done?

317
01:09:18,640 --> 01:09:20,720
I'm not sure I understood.

318
01:09:23,040 --> 01:09:25,000
If I could play for you...

319
01:09:55,640 --> 01:10:00,600
Do you know what the chorus sings?
I thought Patrice had told you.

320
01:10:01,640 --> 01:10:03,720
In Greek, the rhythm is different.

321
01:10:25,640 --> 01:10:28,640
- Who was that girl?
- What girl?

322
01:10:31,680 --> 01:10:33,760
In the photos on the program.
She was with Patrice.

323
01:10:36,680 --> 01:10:38,760
Didn't you know?

324
01:10:40,680 --> 01:10:42,640
Just tell me, were they together?

325
01:10:43,680 --> 01:10:45,760
Yes.

326
01:10:46,680 --> 01:10:48,760
Since when?

327
01:10:49,680 --> 01:10:51,760
Several years.

328
01:10:57,680 --> 01:11:00,640
- Where does she live?
- Near Montparnasse.

329
01:11:01,160 --> 01:11:05,640
They often met at the courts.

330
01:11:06,320 --> 01:11:08,360
She is a lawyer.
Or she works for one.

331
01:11:10,200 --> 01:11:12,280
What do you want to do?

332
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:28,760
Meet her.

333
01:11:59,720 --> 01:12:01,800
Excuse me.

334
01:12:38,760 --> 01:12:40,760
What about equality?

335
01:12:40,840 --> 01:12:43,760
Is it because I don't speak French
that the court won't hear my case?

336
01:13:45,760 --> 01:13:47,840
Excuse me.

337
01:13:55,760 --> 01:13:57,840
Yes?

338
01:13:58,760 --> 01:14:01,720
- You were my husband's mistress?
- Yes.

339
01:14:04,760 --> 01:14:06,840
I didn't know. I just found out.

340
01:14:11,760 --> 01:14:15,720
It's a shame.
Now you'll hate him, and me too.

341
01:14:15,760 --> 01:14:17,880
I don't know...

342
01:14:19,800 --> 01:14:21,880
Of course you will.

343
01:14:28,800 --> 01:14:30,880
It is his child?

344
01:14:33,800 --> 01:14:35,880
Yes.

345
01:14:36,800 --> 01:14:38,880
But he didn't know.

346
01:14:40,800 --> 01:14:42,880
I found out after the accident.

347
01:14:45,800 --> 01:14:50,760
I didn't want a child but it happened.
Now I want to keep it.

348
01:14:58,800 --> 01:15:00,880
Do you have a cigarette?

349
01:15:13,320 --> 01:15:15,320
You shouldn't.

350
01:15:22,800 --> 01:15:25,760
Do you want to know
when and where?

351
01:15:26,800 --> 01:15:28,880
No.

352
01:15:30,800 --> 01:15:35,800
- You want to know if he loved me?
- Yes, that was my question.

353
01:15:37,840 --> 01:15:39,920
Why ask, I know he loved you.

354
01:15:42,840 --> 01:15:44,800
Yes.

355
01:15:44,840 --> 01:15:46,920
He loved me.

356
01:15:47,840 --> 01:15:49,920
Julie...

357
01:15:51,240 --> 01:15:53,000
Will you hate me now?

358
01:17:30,880 --> 01:17:32,840
Come in.

359
01:17:32,880 --> 01:17:34,960
What happened?

360
01:17:37,880 --> 01:17:39,960
You met her?

361
01:17:52,880 --> 01:17:56,320
Once you asked me
to take Patrice's papers.

362
01:17:56,600 --> 01:18:01,840
- You didn't want to.
- No, but if I had...

363
01:18:01,880 --> 01:18:06,840
- The photos were among them?
- Yes.

364
01:18:06,880 --> 01:18:11,880
If I had taken them,
I'd have known.

365
01:18:11,920 --> 01:18:14,880
And if I had burned them,
I'd never have known.

366
01:18:14,920 --> 01:18:17,000
That's right.

367
01:18:18,920 --> 01:18:21,000
Maybe it's better this way.

368
01:18:21,920 --> 01:18:25,360
Can you show me
what you've composed?

369
01:18:25,920 --> 01:18:31,880
- These are violins?
- The altos.

370
01:18:37,920 --> 01:18:40,000
And now...

371
01:18:49,920 --> 01:18:54,880
Wait a second. Lighter,
without the percussions.

372
01:18:58,920 --> 01:19:01,000
Lets remove the trumpets.

373
01:19:15,920 --> 01:19:19,880
- Instead of a piano...
- A Flute?

374
01:19:19,920 --> 01:19:22,000
Flute... Start back here.

375
01:19:48,960 --> 01:19:51,040
That's as far as I got.

376
01:19:51,960 --> 01:19:56,920
- And the finale?
- I don't know.

377
01:19:56,960 --> 01:19:58,040
There was a paper.

378
01:20:01,960 --> 01:20:06,920
The counterpoint was supposed
to come back.

379
01:20:11,960 --> 01:20:16,920
He told me, it is memento.
Try weaving it back in.

380
01:20:17,960 --> 01:20:20,040
Van den Budenmayer?

381
01:20:21,960 --> 01:20:26,920
He wanted to allude to him at the
end. You know how much he loved him.

382
01:20:28,560 --> 01:20:31,920
- Are you still in touch with our lawyer?
- Sometimes.

383
01:20:31,960 --> 01:20:34,920
- Did he sell the house yet?
- I don't know.

384
01:20:34,960 --> 01:20:39,920
- I doubt it. He'd have called.
- Tell him not to.

385
01:20:41,960 --> 01:20:45,920
If you can handle all this,
will you show me?

386
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:47,080
Yes.

387
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:54,080
There was a mattress inside.

388
01:20:54,360 --> 01:20:57,320
Mr Olivier bought it.

389
01:20:57,600 --> 01:21:01,320
- I didn't think you would need it.
- That's fine.

390
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:09,080
Good morning.

391
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:12,960
Have you been here before?

392
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:16,080
No. Never.

393
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:23,960
Upstairs are the bedrooms and the
office. I'll show you them later.

394
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:28,960
This is the Kitchen.
It's always been like this.

395
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:37,960
- Is it a boy or a girl?
- Boy.

396
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:40,080
Have you chosen a name?

397
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:43,080
Yes.

398
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:50,960
I thought... he should have
his name and his house.

399
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:58,960
- Do you still need me?
- No, you can go home. Thank you.

400
01:22:00,520 --> 01:22:04,360
- I knew it.
- What?

401
01:22:05,040 --> 01:22:10,000
- Patrice told me a lot about you.
- Really? like what?

402
01:22:14,040 --> 01:22:16,120
That you are good.

403
01:22:17,040 --> 01:22:19,120
That's what you want to be.

404
01:22:20,040 --> 01:22:25,000
People can always count on you.
Even me.

405
01:22:32,040 --> 01:22:34,120
I'm sorry.

406
01:23:23,080 --> 01:23:25,040
It's me. I finished.

407
01:23:25,080 --> 01:23:28,320
Come pick it up tomorrow.
Or now, if you're not too tired.

408
01:23:28,560 --> 01:23:32,040
I'm not tired. But I will not
come for the score.

409
01:23:32,080 --> 01:23:34,040
What?

410
01:23:35,080 --> 01:23:40,040
I won't pick it up. I've been thinking it
for a week. This music can be mine.

411
01:23:41,080 --> 01:23:44,040
A little heavy and awkward,
but mine.

412
01:23:46,080 --> 01:23:49,040
Or yours, but everyone
would have to know.

413
01:23:51,080 --> 01:23:53,040
Are you there?

414
01:23:53,080 --> 01:23:55,160
Yes.

415
01:23:57,080 --> 01:23:59,160
You right.

416
01:24:32,080 --> 01:24:34,320
It's me. I wanted to ask you.

417
01:24:35,080 --> 01:24:38,040
You really sleep on the mattress?

418
01:24:38,080 --> 01:24:39,200
Yes.

419
01:24:42,120 --> 01:24:46,080
- You never told me.
- No I didn't.

420
01:24:54,120 --> 01:24:56,200
Do you still love me?

421
01:24:59,120 --> 01:25:01,200
I love you.

422
01:25:04,120 --> 01:25:06,200
Are you alone?

423
01:25:07,120 --> 01:25:09,200
Of course I'm alone.

424
01:25:16,120 --> 01:25:18,200
I am coming.

425
01:25:33,120 --> 01:25:35,200
If I can talk like angel,

426
01:25:38,120 --> 01:25:41,200
And I have no love,

427
01:25:42,120 --> 01:25:45,200
I will be a copper ringing.

428
01:25:47,120 --> 01:25:49,200
If I can prophesy

429
01:25:52,120 --> 01:25:55,200
And if I have no love

430
01:25:58,160 --> 01:26:01,240
I will be nothing.

431
01:26:37,160 --> 01:26:39,240
Love is patient.

432
01:26:43,160 --> 01:26:45,240
Love is kind.

433
01:26:47,160 --> 01:26:49,240
It bears all things.

434
01:26:52,160 --> 01:26:54,240
And knows everything.

435
01:26:58,160 --> 01:27:00,240
Love never ends.

436
01:27:05,160 --> 01:27:07,240
Prophecy - gone.

437
01:27:14,200 --> 01:27:16,280
If languages - silent.

438
01:27:17,200 --> 01:27:19,280
Knowledge - nothing.

439
01:27:23,200 --> 01:27:25,280
Prophecy - gone.

440
01:27:28,200 --> 01:27:30,280
Languages - silent.

441
01:27:34,200 --> 01:27:36,280
And only stays

442
01:27:39,200 --> 01:27:41,280
Faith, hope and love

443
01:27:44,200 --> 01:27:46,280
But the biggest one from this three

444
01:27:50,200 --> 01:27:52,280
is love.
