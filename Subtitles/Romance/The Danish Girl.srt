Yes.

Would you like to see more of Einar's work?

734
01:04:02,793 --> 01:04:04,043
- Yes.
- But do we have any?

735
01:04:04,628 --> 01:04:05,958
Of course, Lili.

736
01:04:06,129 --> 01:04:07,839
Could we not do it another time?
Because I just...

737
01:04:08,006 --> 01:04:09,876
I want to hear more about you, Hans.

738
01:04:09,966 --> 01:04:10,966
Are you married?

739

- Well, why not?

I've been on my own a long time now.
I'm too set in my ways.

I think that marriage is the single thing
we should all hope for in life.

No, we've never done that.

01:19:05,821 --> 01:19:07,991
You think these things
because you're exhausted.

915
01:19:12,035 --> 01:19:15,035
Sometimes I think about killing Einar.

916
01:19:16,623 --> 01:19:21,213

that I'd be killing Lili too that stops me.

917

You need to see someone.

918
01:19:25,048 --> 01:19:27,048
- A doctor.
- No.

919
01:19:27,092 --> 01:19:28,512
- Yes.
- No doctors.

920
01:19:28,719 --> 01:19:30,299
I'll help you find someone.

921

I have listened to you very carefully,

926
01:19:48,613 --> 01:19:51,413

I can't go on living

Please excuse me for a moment.

931
01:21:00,811 --> 01:21:02,651

932
01:21:08,068 --> 01:21:09,488

Did I do this to you?

937
01:21:26,670 --> 01:21:27,840
What?

938
01:21:31,883 --> 01:21:34,933

but she was always there.

948
01:22:19,681 --> 01:22:21,311
- Hello.
- Good to see you.

949
01:22:22,559 --> 01:22:24,229
So, what do you think would explain

950
01:22:24,269 --> 01:22:26,559
what you've been experiencing,
Mr. Wegener?

951
01:22:27,064 --> 01:22:29,234
Professor Warnekros, the fact is

952
01:22:32,319 --> 01:22:34,149
I believe that I am a woman,

953
01:22:36,239 --> 01:22:37,409
inside.

954
01:22:39,409 --> 01:22:41,079
And I believe it too.

955
01:22:48,377 --> 01:22:50,747
You probably think that I'm insane.

956
01:22:51,922 --> 01:22:54,092
Or that we both are.

957
01:22:54,591 --> 01:22:56,091
Well,

958
01:22:56,176 --> 01:22:58,846
there are people who think that I'm insane.

959
01:23:03,225 --> 01:23:05,145
But I think you're probably right.

960
01:23:10,023 --> 01:23:12,943
I've met another man like you.

961
01:23:14,611 --> 01:23:16,111
I pursued his case,

962
01:23:16,947 --> 01:23:18,787
against the wishes of my colleagues,
of course.

963
01:23:20,283 --> 01:23:21,873
I told him I could operate

964
01:23:23,203 --> 01:23:24,753
to make him fully a woman.

965
01:23:26,748 --> 01:23:28,328
That was what he wanted.

966
01:23:28,417 --> 01:23:29,787
Is that really possible?

967
01:23:29,876 --> 01:23:31,336
GERDA: What happened to the man?

968
01:23:31,545 --> 01:23:33,005
Was the operation successful?

969
01:23:33,088 --> 01:23:35,628
On the morning of the first operation,
he ran away.

970
01:23:36,383 --> 01:23:37,433
He was too frightened.

971
01:23:37,467 --> 01:23:39,797
I wouldn't do that. I...

972
01:23:40,303 --> 01:23:42,143
WARNEKROS: Perhaps he was the smart one.

973
01:23:42,431 --> 01:23:44,681
The surgery has never
been attempted before.

974
01:23:44,808 --> 01:23:46,138
Never.

975
01:23:48,311 --> 01:23:51,401
Professor Warnekros, what is the surgery?

976
01:23:51,565 --> 01:23:52,985
Two operations.

977
01:23:53,734 --> 01:23:55,654
The first,
to remove the male parts entirely.

978
01:23:57,571 --> 01:23:59,291
The second,
once you're strong enough again,

979
01:24:00,574 --> 01:24:01,824
to construct a vagina.

980
01:24:10,083 --> 01:24:11,673
An irreversible change

981
01:24:14,004 --> 01:24:15,674

Infections.

983
01:24:18,592 --> 01:24:19,632
Complications.

984
01:24:19,676 --> 01:24:21,176
It's too dangerous.

985
01:24:21,344 --> 01:24:23,354

eating so much sugar?

1094
01:35:16,333 --> 01:35:18,253
The trick is you eat nothing else.

1095
01:35:18,418 --> 01:35:19,958
- See you tomorrow.
- See you tomorrow.

1096
01:35:22,589 --> 01:35:24,009
- Bye, Lili.
- Bye.

1097
01:35:25,550 --> 01:35:27,030
SHOP ASSISTANT: Lili, are you coming?

1098
01:35:33,225 --> 01:35:36,905
You know, one night last week,
I had the strangest dream.

1099
01:35:38,146 --> 01:35:39,146
What was it?

1100
01:35:39,314 --> 01:35:40,984
I dreamed you were getting married.

1101
01:35:41,108 --> 01:35:42,188
(CHUCKLES)

1102
01:35:47,322 --> 01:35:49,032
Do you think I ever will?

1103
01:35:49,199 --> 01:35:50,529
Who knows?

1104
01:35:50,742 --> 01:35:53,412
So many strange things have happened.

1105
01:35:54,871 --> 01:35:56,921
I do want to, Gerda.

1106
01:35:59,084 --> 01:36:02,504
It's not so long ago we were married,
you and me.

1107
01:36:05,507 --> 01:36:07,047
You and Einar.

1108
01:36:10,637 --> 01:36:12,057
I know it was Einar.

1109
01:36:12,222 --> 01:36:13,682
But really,

1110
01:36:15,642 --> 01:36:18,392
it was you and me.

1111
01:36:40,083 --> 01:36:41,423
Lili.

1112
01:36:44,421 --> 01:36:45,511
Is it really you?

1113
01:36:47,382 --> 01:36:48,682
I believe so.

1114
01:36:53,722 --> 01:36:56,562
So, what you're suggesting

1115
01:36:58,685 --> 01:37:00,515
is that, uh, a doctor

1116
01:37:03,106 --> 01:37:04,436
intervened.

1117
01:37:04,483 --> 01:37:06,613
To correct a mistake in nature.

1118
01:37:07,402 --> 01:37:08,952
He made you a woman.

1119
01:37:09,404 --> 01:37:11,614
No, God made me a woman.

1120
01:37:11,656 --> 01:37:13,906
But the doctor... He... The doctor

1121
01:37:14,076 --> 01:37:17,696
is curing me of the sickness
that was my disguise.

1122
01:37:21,625 --> 01:37:22,715
A real woman.

1123
01:37:41,061 --> 01:37:43,401
You're going to need a new notebook
if you carry on like that.

1124
01:37:43,480 --> 01:37:46,190
When Warnekros suggested I keep a diary,

1125
01:37:46,274 --> 01:37:48,484
I thought I'd never have anything to write.

1126
01:37:50,112 --> 01:37:52,112
It does help,

1127
01:37:52,155 --> 01:37:53,485
just to make sense of things.

1128
01:37:53,990 --> 01:37:55,620
Maybe I should try it.

1129
01:37:56,284 --> 01:37:57,494
(CHUCKLES)

1130
01:38:01,206 --> 01:38:02,246
So,

1131
01:38:03,667 --> 01:38:05,667
do you enjoy working at Fonnesbech's?

1132
01:38:06,211 --> 01:38:08,001
For now, at least.

1133
01:38:08,046 --> 01:38:10,006
I do enjoy sort of being part of it.

1134
01:38:10,841 --> 01:38:12,381
You never think of painting?

1135
01:38:15,804 --> 01:38:16,854
You might be good at it.

1136
01:38:16,930 --> 01:38:19,430
Gerda, I want to be a woman, not a painter.

1137
01:38:20,559 --> 01:38:22,849
Well, people have been known to do both.

1138
01:38:27,315 --> 01:38:30,185
I'm curious to see what you would paint.

1139
01:38:30,235 --> 01:38:32,525
That's all. Sometimes it's
hard to know what's in your...

1140
01:38:32,696 --> 01:38:34,986
Didn't you just take one of those
a minute ago?

1141
01:38:35,490 --> 01:38:37,120
Gerda, I know what I'm doing.

1142
01:38:41,204 --> 01:38:43,084
I'm just going to get some fresh air.

1143
01:38:44,708 --> 01:38:47,208
You know, sometimes I do wonder
why you let me go through all this,

1144
01:38:47,252 --> 01:38:49,302
if you thought that
everything would be the same afterwards.

1145
01:38:49,379 --> 01:38:50,879
I didn't.

1146
01:38:51,757 --> 01:38:53,757
But I promised Einar
that I would take care of you.

1147
01:38:53,842 --> 01:38:56,182
For goodness' sakes, Gerda, Einar is dead.

1148
01:38:56,219 --> 01:38:57,889
We both have to accept that.

1149
01:38:59,973 --> 01:39:02,563
You took care of me,
but now I have to take care of myself.

1150
01:39:02,601 --> 01:39:04,691
I have to have a life of my own.

1151
01:39:06,563 --> 01:39:08,613
And you need to do the same.

1152
01:39:11,943 --> 01:39:13,073
Come on, Hvap.

1153
01:39:29,461 --> 01:39:30,461
Uh, yes.

1154
01:39:30,545 --> 01:39:31,625
(PHONE RINGING)

1155
01:39:31,713 --> 01:39:32,883
In London.

1156
01:39:34,383 --> 01:39:35,433
Uh, is it urgent?

1157
01:39:36,009 --> 01:39:37,429
No, that's fine.

1158
01:39:38,387 --> 01:39:39,637
Just tell him...

1159
01:39:41,973 --> 01:39:44,023
Just say it's a beautiful
day in Copenhagen.

1160
01:39:49,940 --> 01:39:51,940
- GERDA: Morning.
- Good morning.

1161
01:40:15,966 --> 01:40:18,836
It's not what you think.
Henrik's homosexual.

1162
01:40:19,010 --> 01:40:20,970
There's nothing between us.

1163
01:40:22,723 --> 01:40:24,723
I should have told you that I'd seen him.

1164
01:40:25,016 --> 01:40:26,636
No, you shouldn't.

1165
01:40:27,144 --> 01:40:28,824
He's a friend, Gerdie, someone to talk to.

1166
01:40:29,354 --> 01:40:31,364
Because you can't talk to me.

1167
01:40:32,983 --> 01:40:34,823
I've made a decision.

1168
01:40:36,153 --> 01:40:38,203
I'm going back to Dresden
for the second operation.

1169
01:40:38,989 --> 01:40:40,199
That's too soon.

1170
01:40:40,282 --> 01:40:41,782
No... No, it's time.

1171
01:40:42,075 --> 01:40:44,155
I need to finish what I started.

1172
01:40:44,244 --> 01:40:45,254
You're not strong enough.

1173
01:40:45,328 --> 01:40:47,458
Professor Warnekros thinks that I am.

1174
01:40:48,331 --> 01:40:49,711
Warnekros?

1175
01:40:49,833 --> 01:40:51,333
Warnekros hasn't seen you.

1176
01:40:51,418 --> 01:40:52,628
I've made up my mind, Gerda.

1177
01:40:53,837 --> 01:40:55,167
It could kill you.

1178
01:40:55,213 --> 01:40:57,383
I'm going on Friday. Will you come with me?

1179
01:41:01,511 --> 01:41:03,851
I won't help you to hurt yourself.

1180
01:41:21,364 --> 01:41:22,874
Gerda, will you come?

1181
01:41:44,679 --> 01:41:47,059
This will be harder than
the first operation.

1182
01:41:48,475 --> 01:41:49,685
You understand that?

1183
01:41:50,894 --> 01:41:53,354
Yes, I do.

1184
01:41:55,857 --> 01:41:57,727
It's complex surgery.

1185
01:41:59,903 --> 01:42:02,863
And I will sleep all the way through it.

1186
01:42:03,907 --> 01:42:05,407
(BOTH CHUCKLING)

1187
01:42:06,201 --> 01:42:07,291
Yes, you will.

1188
01:42:07,411 --> 01:42:09,871
And you'll be there when I wake up.

1189
01:42:12,207 --> 01:42:13,577
Of course.

1190
01:42:14,584 --> 01:42:17,004
I want a husband who looks just like you.

1191
01:42:20,382 --> 01:42:21,382
Um...

1192
01:42:22,092 --> 01:42:24,092
Maybe a child one day.

1193
01:42:28,348 --> 01:42:30,098
Like a real woman.

1194
01:42:31,518 --> 01:42:33,348
One step at a time.

1195
01:42:40,902 --> 01:42:42,992

I'm not angry with you.

1199
01:43:02,340 --> 01:43:04,180
I'm worried about you.

1200
01:43:05,969 --> 01:43:08,009
You heard my wish, Gerda.

1201
01:43:09,598 --> 01:43:11,428
When no one else could hear me,

1202
01:43:12,726 --> 01:43:14,306
you did.

1203
01:43:19,232 --> 01:43:20,362
Come.

1204
01:43:21,193 --> 01:43:22,823
We both need our rest.

1205
01:43:23,653 --> 01:43:24,853
I'll sleep on the chair there.

1206
01:43:26,907 --> 01:43:29,527
- No, off to your little hotel.
- I don't mind.

1207
01:43:29,618 --> 01:43:31,158
Here, take this.

1208
01:43:31,203 --> 01:43:32,703
Because there's a chill in the air.

1209
01:43:35,499 --> 01:43:37,709
- No.
- Please.

1210
01:43:37,793 --> 01:43:40,093
You have it. For now.

1211
01:43:41,797 --> 01:43:43,507
I'm going to be fine.

1212
01:43:44,549 --> 01:43:45,679
