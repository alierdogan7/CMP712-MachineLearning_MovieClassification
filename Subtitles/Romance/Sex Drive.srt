Hello, my name is Sean Anders.
Screenwriter and director of <i>Sex Drive.</i>

2
00:00:10,991 --> 00:00:13,551
Hi, John. I didn't see you there.

3
00:00:13,627 --> 00:00:18,462
- This is John Morris.
- Screenwriter and producer of <i>Sex Drive.</i>

4
00:00:18,532 --> 00:00:21,365
- Welcome to the unrated...
- Uncircumcised...

00:00:21,435 --> 00:00:22,732

00:00:22,803 --> 00:00:24,703
<i>...Sex Drive.</i>
<i>- Sex Drive.</i>

7
00:00:24,771 --> 00:00:27,262
How many times has this happened to you?

8
00:00:27,341 --> 00:00:31,675
You purchase an unrated DVD to view
with your friends. Only with your friends...

9
00:00:31,745 --> 00:00:35,875
Only to find that you got the same
old movie with a few extra curse words,

10
00:00:35,949 --> 00:00:38,247
and maybe an additional tit or two.

11
00:00:38,318 --> 00:00:40,377
- What a jip.
- And how...

12
00:00:40,454 --> 00:00:41,785
Not this time.

13
00:00:41,855 --> 00:00:46,019
That's right, John.
On this unrated DVD we promise you,

14
00:00:46,093 --> 00:00:47,424
the viewer,

15
00:00:48,495 --> 00:00:52,454
a genuinely wacky, zany
and unrated viewing experience.

16
00:00:52,532 --> 00:00:55,433
- We promise...
- Plus, we promise more tits.

17
00:00:55,502 --> 00:00:57,766
Bare tits like these.

18
00:00:59,506 --> 00:01:01,337
These tits are good.

19
00:01:02,342 --> 00:01:05,311
Plus, more cock, like this.

20
00:01:06,446 --> 00:01:08,346
That's good cock, John.

21
00:01:08,782 --> 00:01:13,082
That's right, John, and that's not all,
we promise lots of additional scenes,

22
00:01:13,153 --> 00:01:17,487
takes and other bullshit
that will make the movie way too long.

23
00:01:17,557 --> 00:01:20,321
And this means a lower standard
of filmmaking for you,

24
00:01:20,394 --> 00:01:21,383
- the viewer.
- The viewer.

25
00:01:21,628 --> 00:01:26,156
So, if you've never seen <i>Sex Drive</i> before,
please, for real,

26
00:01:26,233 --> 00:01:28,701
do not watch this version first.

27
00:01:28,769 --> 00:01:32,500
Watch the real theatrical version
and then come back and watch this one.

28
00:01:32,572 --> 00:01:33,664
Why?

29
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:38,302
Yes, because this version
of the movie is going to suck.

30
00:01:45,419 --> 00:01:49,378
Sorry, but I couldn't help but notice you.
I have this exact same tribal tattoo.

Excuse me. Do you know where the Gap is?

170

TIFFANY: Felicia. How's it fitting, hon?

175
00:12:31,264 --> 00:12:34,722
Well, you look nice.

176
00:12:35,468 --> 00:12:37,629
You know, sweetie,
there's still time to have your boobs done

177
00:12:37,703 --> 00:12:38,863
before my wedding.

178
00:12:38,938 --> 00:12:41,406
Darren and I already discussed them,
and he said he'd pay for it.

179
00:12:41,474 --> 00:12:44,637
I mean, he's a dentist,
so it's totally not a big deal.

180

Excuse me, do you have a pair of scissors?

181
00:12:48,181 --> 00:12:50,240
Oh! Sure, sweetie. Do you have a stringie?

182
00:12:50,316 --> 00:12:53,808
Oh, no. I was just hoping
you could slit my wrists for me quickly.

183
00:12:53,886 --> 00:12:56,684
My husband killed himself last Christmas.

184

Hello. This is a coupon
for six free donuts. Donuts?

186

Oh, my God! You look so hot in that.

187
00:13:19,011 --> 00:13:21,946
Hey, sweetheart, listen.
Please don't take this the wrong way,

188
00:13:22,014 --> 00:13:23,948
but your whole trying too hard thing,

189
00:13:24,016 --> 00:13:26,678
it's just coming across as needy,
you know?

190
00:13:26,752 --> 00:13:29,084
And I think you're better than that,
Kimberly.

191
00:13:29,155 --> 00:13:34,058
- But all I was saying was that...
- Shh! Let's see it in a large. Okay?

192
00:13:34,227 --> 00:13:36,218
I mean, Christ,
I'm out buying him clothes right now.

I don't have to do that shit anymore.

I'm losing you. I'm going into a tunnel.

Well, it's official, Lance,
your mom's still bat-shit crazy.

196
00:13:50,176 --> 00:13:52,474
What? You're telling me
she doesn't shit-talk me?

197
00:13:52,545 --> 00:13:55,446
No, actually, she doesn't. She doesn't, ever.

198
00:13:55,515 --> 00:13:58,348
All right. Let me give you some advice,
Lance, all right?

199

Don't ever get married.
Just an endless parade of horseshit.

always wear a rubber. Christ.

Nice. Always classy.

202

Hey, come on, Lance, I didn't mean it like...
Come on, dawg.

on the front of me again?

Lan, why do you got to work the mouth
when you talk to us?

- Yeah, lan.
- Sorry, it's a... It's a habit.

Hey, that girl you work with, Becca,
you gonna bring her to my party tonight?

216
00:15:03,482 --> 00:15:08,181
- Yeah, I asked her. She said no.
- Good. Dude, she's totally wrong for you.

217
00:15:08,254 --> 00:15:10,722
That's what you say about everyone.

218
00:15:10,790 --> 00:15:12,781
She made you wear
the fucking costume again, right?

219

- You know, I don't mind...
- Dude, if you told her to fuck off,

220
00:15:15,361 --> 00:15:18,694
she'd be two knuckles deep right now
daydreaming about your big black cock.

221
00:15:18,764 --> 00:15:19,958
Lan, do not listen to him.

222

who's gonna treat them well.

- Yes. Really.

everybody wants a challenge.

- What they can't get. I know, I got it.

Do you get it? 'Cause I mean, it feels like
I'm teaching you to walk sometimes.

being a dick?

235
00:15:58,638 --> 00:16:03,098
Yeah, kind of. Being kind of a dick.
I'd say... No, not really.

236
00:16:04,043 --> 00:16:06,011
I mean, you know,
I've sort of been practicing

your whole being-a-dick thing
with this girl I met online.

- Thanks.

how to close.

- What's your address?

- Yeah.

Yes. It hurts.

- Right, 'cause I'm Amish,

842
00:54:27,044 --> 00:54:30,013
so I wouldn't know anything
about your '69 GTO Judge.

843
00:54:30,314 --> 00:54:34,080

something like that.

straight from space.

847
00:54:45,162 --> 00:54:46,322
IAN: Wow!

848
00:54:46,396 --> 00:54:47,420
FELICIA: Okay.

849
00:54:47,497 --> 00:54:51,797
What are you doing? Whoa, whoa.
No, no, no. Leesh, that's a bad idea.

850
00:54:51,969 --> 00:54:53,129
- What?
- Come on.

851
00:54:53,203 --> 00:54:55,728
You don't know how far we have to walk.
Those are your only pair of shoes.

852
00:54:55,806 --> 00:54:59,071
You know what? You're probably right.
God, you're so sensible.

853

00:55:01,979 --> 00:55:03,276
I should.

855

So he met this chick on the Internet,
which is sketchy.

857
00:55:10,721 --> 00:55:12,211
The Internet?

858
00:55:12,589 --> 00:55:17,151
Yeah, it's like a series of computers
that are connected through...

859
00:55:17,227 --> 00:55:18,558
Computers?

860
00:55:20,197 --> 00:55:23,792
A computer is like a big calculator,
you know, with the screen.

- You ever heard of Rumspringa?

864
00:55:31,174 --> 00:55:33,608
Yeah, that ska band from Delaware.

865
00:55:33,677 --> 00:55:37,875
No, it means "run wild." It's an Amish
tradition where when we turn 16,

866
00:55:37,948 --> 00:55:40,508
we can go live like you heathens
for a while.

867
00:55:40,584 --> 00:55:45,817
You go nuts, party for months or years
till your folks start hassling you,

868
00:55:45,889 --> 00:55:48,255
and then it's back to the Stone Age.

869
00:55:48,325 --> 00:55:50,316
But if you're on Rumspringa,
what's with the buggy?

870
00:55:50,394 --> 00:55:53,591
Oh, no. I'm not. Not anymore.

871
00:55:53,664 --> 00:55:56,064
I probably shouldn't even be
talking to you but...

872
00:55:56,133 --> 00:55:58,966
I'm a little bit of an Amish floutlaw.

873
00:55:59,036 --> 00:56:02,494
- Sometimes I just miss the world.
- What do you miss the most?

874
00:56:02,572 --> 00:56:05,769
You know, I miss sarcasm.
It's mostly lost on my people.

875

Oh.

876

And buttfucking.

878
00:56:16,553 --> 00:56:18,384
- LANCE: I hear that.
- Oh, yeah.

879
00:56:19,222 --> 00:56:20,553
Buttfucking.

880
00:56:21,625 --> 00:56:24,093
Wait, are we talking about dudes?

881
00:56:24,828 --> 00:56:27,194
- No.
- Okay. Then yeah.

882
00:56:28,231 --> 00:56:32,065
I mean, unless that's what you're into,
and then, whatever.

883
00:56:32,135 --> 00:56:33,864
- It's not.
- No?

884
00:56:33,937 --> 00:56:34,926
No.

885

- No, no, no, no, no.

whether you fight it or not.

895
00:57:07,404 --> 00:57:10,532
Hey! I'm driving halfway across the country
to go to...

896
00:57:10,607 --> 00:57:14,168

897
00:57:14,311 --> 00:57:17,109

- That's the funniest thing, too.
- I know.

902
00:57:23,687 --> 00:57:27,521
I know, I was with this stripper in Vegas,
and I was like, "you want this?"

903
00:57:27,591 --> 00:57:31,186
So she's like, "Yeah, I want it, I want it."

904
00:57:32,429 --> 00:57:34,761
And I was like,
yeah, this gets hotter by the second.

905
00:57:34,831 --> 00:57:38,562
"What're you crying about?" She's like,
"...wanted to be a doctor."

906
00:57:38,635 --> 00:57:43,572
And I'm like,
"Yeah, you're a fucking Ph.D. Of cock."

907

- Yeah.
- Yeah, exactly.

and tell her "I'm on Rumspringa."

02:01:59,559 --> 02:02:01,550
<i>Let's see, what else?</i>

1808
02:02:02,195 --> 02:02:04,720
<i>Oh, Andy and Randy finally got a girlfriend.</i>

1809
02:02:07,634 --> 02:02:11,035
<i>And on New Year's Eve,</i>
<i>Felicia and I finally visited Grandma.</i>

1810
02:02:11,104 --> 02:02:12,162
Again?

1811
02:02:13,439 --> 02:02:14,872
Damn, yes.

1812
02:02:17,543 --> 02:02:19,568
- Felicia, you want to do this?
- Yes.

1813
02:02:26,152 --> 02:02:27,551
(LAUGHING)

1814
02:02:28,454 --> 02:02:30,217
Oh, that was awesome!

1815
02:03:10,463 --> 02:03:14,399
- Hey, boys. You get some rest?
- Thanks, man. Thanks for fixing the bus.

1816
02:03:14,467 --> 02:03:16,230
- A pleasure.
- Yeah, thanks for fixing our bus.

1817
02:03:16,302 --> 02:03:18,702
- Appreciate it.
- Thanks for playing that show for us, too.

1818
02:03:18,771 --> 02:03:22,104
- Yeah, no worries.
- It was a nice five-song set.

1819
02:03:22,175 --> 02:03:24,575
Yeah, what do you guys typically...

1820
02:03:24,644 --> 02:03:27,078
I assume you get compensated
very well for that.

1821
02:03:27,146 --> 02:03:30,047
- Must be a good living.
- Yeah, we do. I mean...

1822
02:03:30,116 --> 02:03:33,017
Yeah, you know, I...
Gosh, if I was really to calculate

1823
02:03:33,086 --> 02:03:36,214
what you'd lose if this bus
couldn't have gotten back on the road,

1824
02:03:36,289 --> 02:03:37,483
if you couldn't have gotten to your shows,

1825
02:03:37,557 --> 02:03:42,426
I imagine all those weeping teenage girls
outside, "I need to dance."

1826
02:03:42,495 --> 02:03:45,464
Could we send you some pictures?
We don't really have cash or anything.

1827
02:03:45,531 --> 02:03:48,500
- Some autographed photos?
- Or we could give you CDs.

1828
02:03:48,568 --> 02:03:50,798
Yeah, we've got a lot of use
for that around here.

1829
02:03:50,870 --> 02:03:52,963
There is a lot of work
that needs to be done around here.

1830
02:03:53,039 --> 02:03:57,305
- You guys are some strapping young lads.
- I don't know if we're really built for that.

1831
02:03:58,745 --> 02:04:01,270
- Yeah.
- I can hear you.

1832
02:04:01,347 --> 02:04:03,747
I'm just saying,
you guys put in a 20-minute show,

1833
02:04:03,816 --> 02:04:05,443
- we spent all night on the bus...
- Yeah.

1834
02:04:05,518 --> 02:04:06,712
I mean, that was a lot of work.

1835
02:04:06,786 --> 02:04:08,981
We could maybe try
to write a check later on,

1836
02:04:09,055 --> 02:04:11,523
or like I said,
we could send you guys some CDs.

1837
02:04:11,591 --> 02:04:13,821
City folk are always trying to solve things
with money.

1838
02:04:13,893 --> 02:04:15,918
It's the spirit of the community
around here.

1839
02:04:15,995 --> 02:04:18,520
Lord, please bless this Fall Out Boy.

1840
02:04:18,598 --> 02:04:21,362
Keep him safe on the road.

1841
02:04:21,434 --> 02:04:24,528
Help him to aspire
to the heights of Jon Bon Jovi.

1842
02:04:24,604 --> 02:04:25,832
- Help him to...
- Thanks.

1843
02:04:25,905 --> 02:04:27,805
- Okay, thanks, man.
- Thanks, man. We gotta roll.

1844
02:04:27,874 --> 02:04:29,808
- Amen.
- We gotta roll, man. Thank you very much.

1845
02:04:29,876 --> 02:04:31,434
All right, boys.
It was a pleasure meeting you.

1846
02:04:31,511 --> 02:04:34,480
I loved your penis on the Internet,
by the way.

1847
02:04:34,547 --> 02:04:36,606
- Fucking asshole!
- You're a dick!

1848
02:04:37,350 --> 02:04:39,250

1866
02:05:58,297 --> 02:06:01,198

Hi. I'm Amanda Crew, professional actor.

1902
02:09:05,551 --> 02:09:07,883
You know in all the teen unrated DVDs,

1903
02:09:07,953 --> 02:09:11,514
you never really get to see
the star's naughty parts.

1904
02:09:11,991 --> 02:09:15,427
Well, that is gonna change today.

1905
02:09:15,494 --> 02:09:17,394
That's right. Take a seat,

1906
02:09:17,463 --> 02:09:20,296
maybe close the door
so mom doesn't come in.

1907
02:09:20,366 --> 02:09:23,267
Get all ready. Looks good.

1908
02:09:24,670 --> 02:09:26,001
Here we go.

1909
02:09:29,742 --> 02:09:31,232
Suckers!

1910
02:09:32,878 --> 02:09:34,175
This is serious matter.

1911
02:09:35,281 --> 02:09:36,441
Run for your life.

1912
02:09:36,515 --> 02:09:39,109
MAN 1: Oh, shit! You know what?
We see the fake balls on the table there.

1913
02:09:39,185 --> 02:09:40,209
(ALL LAUGHING)

1914
02:09:40,286 --> 02:09:43,016
MAN 2: All right. We'll shoot another. Cut.
MAN 3: Cut.
