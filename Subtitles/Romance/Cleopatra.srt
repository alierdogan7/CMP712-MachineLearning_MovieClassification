1
00:00:02,863 --> 00:00:05,354
Have our lookouts been
given Octavian's insignia ?

2
00:00:05,466 --> 00:00:07,366
A golden eagle.
We've had it in sight since sunrise--

3
00:00:07,468 --> 00:00:09,800
By sunset we'll have
those gold feathers.

4
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:14,631
Let Octavian know
we are coming !

5
00:00:14,742 --> 00:00:19,441
Let the enemy hear the voice
of Antony's legions !

6
00:00:22,950 --> 00:00:27,080
[ Shouting <i>I</i>n Unison ]

7
00:00:40,568 --> 00:00:44,004
[ Shouting, Distant ]

8
00:00:44,105 --> 00:00:48,940
He's on his way.
Signal my Lord Caesar's ship.
Does it fly his insignia ?

9
00:00:49,043 --> 00:00:51,603
My orders are to be followed
exactly as issued.

10
00:00:56,917 --> 00:01:01,377
And may the gods grant that Antony
has not changed his plan of battle.

11
00:01:07,661 --> 00:01:09,561
There he goes,

12
00:01:09,663 --> 00:01:13,827
as he's done a hundred times on land--
straight for the center.

13
00:01:13,934 --> 00:01:18,462
If only it were on land, and we
were there to protect his flanks.

14
00:01:18,572 --> 00:01:20,472
But we're not.

15
00:01:24,278 --> 00:01:27,145
This and all other dispositions are
to be signaled to Admiral Euphranor...

16
00:01:27,248 --> 00:01:29,307
aboard
Queen Cleopatra's barge.

17
00:01:29,417 --> 00:01:31,317
Euphranor ! But surely
he's in command of--

18
00:01:31,419 --> 00:01:35,719
In command of moving toy ships
on a painted ocean...

19
00:01:35,823 --> 00:01:39,884
so that Egypt's queen can more
clearly follow her war upon water...

20
00:01:39,994 --> 00:01:43,361
to which she has committed
Marc Antony and 20,000 Romans.

21
00:01:53,474 --> 00:01:56,068
Just as he said he would.

22
00:01:56,177 --> 00:01:59,977
Lord Antony and his escorts have moved
out by themselves after Octavian.

23
00:02:00,081 --> 00:02:02,982
- He's already broken
through their center.
- They let him through.

24
00:02:03,084 --> 00:02:05,109
The Roman line
will close behind him.

25
00:02:05,219 --> 00:02:07,119
Not if we engage and hold them,
as Antony said.

26
00:02:07,221 --> 00:02:12,181
They won't engage. Agrippa will
pull them back and back, behind Antony,

27
00:02:12,293 --> 00:02:14,193
as Antony
chases Octavian.

28
00:02:16,730 --> 00:02:18,630
What reports
do you have ?

29
00:02:18,732 --> 00:02:22,634
Lord Antony is already through the
center of the Roman line, Your Majesty.

30
00:02:24,905 --> 00:02:30,241
He is now deep within the Roman fleet,
in pursuit of Octavian.

31
00:02:41,822 --> 00:02:43,722
Faster ! Faster !

32
00:02:55,569 --> 00:02:59,130
They've increased their own speed,
my lord. We're too heavy to catch them.

33
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:01,765
Then we'll slow them down.

34
00:03:01,876 --> 00:03:05,039
Start the ballistas.
Javelin throwers.

35
00:03:05,146 --> 00:03:07,944
Aim high.
Overshoot rather than under.

36
00:03:12,553 --> 00:03:14,680
Ballistas. Javelins.

37
00:03:19,593 --> 00:03:21,493
Ballistas !

38
00:03:32,072 --> 00:03:37,135
Octavian's ships are so much faster
than our Egyptian tubs.

39
00:03:37,244 --> 00:03:40,213
Why doesn't Agrippa keep him away
from Antony's ballistas ?

40
00:03:54,728 --> 00:03:56,696
[ Ramos ]
Ballistas!

41
00:04:15,649 --> 00:04:17,549
Ballistas!

42
00:04:26,927 --> 00:04:29,452
Ballistas!

43
00:04:29,563 --> 00:04:32,259
My lord !
My lord !

44
00:04:32,366 --> 00:04:35,392
A direct hit on the enemy.
One bank of oars has been destroyed.

45
00:04:38,973 --> 00:04:41,874
He's coming around
broadside.

46
00:04:41,976 --> 00:04:44,410
We've got him.
Collision course.

47
00:04:44,511 --> 00:04:47,776
We'll ram him,
board and destroy him.

48
00:05:42,736 --> 00:05:44,636
Octavian !

49
00:05:47,675 --> 00:05:50,940
O<i>c</i>tavian! No<i>w</i> is
your time to be a Caesar.

50
00:06:16,337 --> 00:06:20,467
- Where is he hiding ?
- My Lord Octavian is not on board.

51
00:06:23,744 --> 00:06:26,645
And now we close the trap.

52
00:06:26,747 --> 00:06:30,205
Now we hit my Lord Antony
with everything we have.

53
00:06:52,506 --> 00:06:56,237
No word of Lord Antony ?
By now he must have Octavian.

54
00:06:56,343 --> 00:06:58,243
You, yourself, said
he rammed Octavian's ship.

55
00:06:58,345 --> 00:07:02,247
It may be Lord Antony rammed a ship
flying Octavian's insignia, huh ?

56
00:07:02,349 --> 00:07:05,682
But if it is Octavian's ship--
If Octavian is on board--

57
00:07:05,786 --> 00:07:08,311
And if Lord Antony
fiinds and kills Octavian,

58
00:07:08,422 --> 00:07:10,720
he is still surrounded
by half the Roman fleet.

59
00:07:10,824 --> 00:07:13,384
- Then send him help.
- I've none to send.

60
00:07:16,330 --> 00:07:19,595
They're pulling
our ships apart now.

61
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:22,225
They've got Antony alone
and cut off,

62
00:07:22,336 --> 00:07:26,432
closing in on him like a pack of dogs
on a wounded bear.

63
00:08:47,788 --> 00:08:50,814
- Lord Antony's ship ?
- Gone.

64
00:08:52,893 --> 00:08:55,862
- And Octavian's ship ?
- Burning, helpless.

65
00:09:04,838 --> 00:09:07,602
Would you say, Admiral,

66
00:09:07,708 --> 00:09:10,973
that Lord Antony is dead ?

67
00:09:22,789 --> 00:09:24,780
How is the wind for Egypt ?

68
00:09:24,892 --> 00:09:26,723
Fair.

69
00:09:31,832 --> 00:09:34,357
We'll sail at once.

70
00:09:42,276 --> 00:09:44,301
Man the oar-banks.
Hoist anchor.

71
00:09:44,411 --> 00:09:46,311
We sail for Egypt !

72
00:10:18,211 --> 00:10:20,111
My Lord Canidius !

73
00:10:35,929 --> 00:10:40,263
Remember always, that after
the battle of Actium,

74
00:10:40,367 --> 00:10:45,202
with Octavian dead
and Antony dead,

75
00:10:45,305 --> 00:10:47,466
you saw the victor...

76
00:10:47,574 --> 00:10:51,408
sail away
on her golden barge.

77
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:03,715
She's going.
Cleopatra's going !

78
00:11:09,262 --> 00:11:12,060
- Leaving me !
- My lord.

79
00:11:12,165 --> 00:11:15,965
My lord, our casualties are heavy.
We have little armor left.

80
00:11:16,069 --> 00:11:19,004
Our men need regrouping,
someone to give them courage.

81
00:11:19,106 --> 00:11:22,735
<i>M</i>y lord, the dying are <i>c</i>alling for you.
The living need your help.

82
00:11:22,843 --> 00:11:25,209
You can't leave them.

83
00:11:25,312 --> 00:11:27,212
Listen to me !

84
00:12:23,003 --> 00:12:26,200
Caesar, news ! Great news !

85
00:12:26,306 --> 00:12:28,934
Cleopatra is leaving the battle.
Antony is following her.

86
00:12:29,042 --> 00:12:31,442
We have won a great victory.

87
00:12:41,221 --> 00:12:44,987
[ Euphranor ]
Weigh oars!

88
00:14:15,949 --> 00:14:20,147
Her Majesty is most anxious
to see you. Will you come below ?

89
00:14:22,455 --> 00:14:24,980
Perhaps if you wish to remain here,
she will come to you.

90
00:14:27,093 --> 00:14:31,291
Shall I
send you food ? Wine ?

91
00:14:36,369 --> 00:14:38,963
Her Majesty's orders.

92
00:14:39,072 --> 00:14:42,803
She's afraid you might...
harm yourself.

93
00:16:26,613 --> 00:16:28,513
Please.

94
00:16:30,817 --> 00:16:35,845
Octavian has crossed
from Syria into Egypt.

95
00:16:35,956 --> 00:16:38,254
He can be here
in a matter of weeks.

96
00:16:38,358 --> 00:16:41,885
There are two full legions
here in Alexandria...

97
00:16:41,995 --> 00:16:43,895
who have remained
loyal to you.

98
00:16:43,997 --> 00:16:47,592
They and their offi<i>ic</i>ers...

99
00:16:47,701 --> 00:16:50,636
are <i>w</i>aiting for you
to <i>c</i>ommand them.

100
00:16:50,737 --> 00:16:53,729
If not to me,

101
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:56,070
won't you speak
to Rufiio at least...

102
00:16:56,176 --> 00:17:00,237
or to anyone
you choose ?

103
00:17:00,347 --> 00:17:04,613
Antony,just say
what you want done and it will be.

104
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:11,589
It's been so long since you've
looked at me. Don't turn away,

105
00:17:11,691 --> 00:17:14,489
even like this,

106
00:17:14,594 --> 00:17:18,428
with your eyes
fiilled with hate.

107
00:17:18,531 --> 00:17:20,465
How they burn with hate.

108
00:17:24,004 --> 00:17:26,029
Why, Antony ? Why ?

109
00:17:26,139 --> 00:17:29,040
Be<i>c</i>ause <i>I</i> ran a<i>w</i>ay?

110
00:17:29,142 --> 00:17:32,009
They told me
you <i>w</i>ere dead!

111
00:17:35,315 --> 00:17:38,284
What... could I do ?

112
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:45,522
Where could I go...
in a world suddenly without you,

113
00:17:47,093 --> 00:17:50,392
except to my son
and my country,

114
00:17:50,497 --> 00:17:53,398
Caesarion and Egypt ?

115
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:57,266
I wanted to save them
from Octavian.

116
00:17:57,370 --> 00:18:00,237
You would have
wanted me to go.

117
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:02,308
You would have
commanded me to go.

118
00:18:03,810 --> 00:18:06,335
Tell me
you <i>w</i>ould have!

119
00:18:08,214 --> 00:18:10,648
[ Sobbing ]

120
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:13,719
They told me
you were dead.

121
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:18,189
[ Sobbing Continues ]
They told me you were dead.

122
00:18:27,067 --> 00:18:29,331
You were quite right.

123
00:18:29,436 --> 00:18:31,768
I am dead.

124
00:18:35,975 --> 00:18:38,375
[ Sobbing ]

125
00:19:02,802 --> 00:19:06,238
The armies of my Lord Caius
Julius Caesar are advancing even now,

126
00:19:06,339 --> 00:19:08,239
without opposition,
upon Alexandria.

127
00:19:08,341 --> 00:19:10,969
Caius Julius Caesar ?

128
00:19:11,077 --> 00:19:14,205
So now Octavian has
stolen all of the name.

129
00:19:14,314 --> 00:19:16,282
My Lord Caesar
wishes it to be known...

130
00:19:16,382 --> 00:19:19,146
that he no longer has a quarrel
with Cleopatra of Egypt.

131
00:19:19,252 --> 00:19:22,710
Then let him take his armies
out of here and go home.

132
00:19:22,822 --> 00:19:28,158
He has charged me to say that the choice
of war or peace now rests with Egypt.

133
00:19:28,261 --> 00:19:31,628
And that for himself,
he desires only pea<i>c</i>e.

134
00:19:31,731 --> 00:19:36,759
And what are his terms for
this unconditional peace ?

135
00:19:36,870 --> 00:19:40,806
A small token.
A demonstration.

136
00:19:40,907 --> 00:19:46,402
A gesture. An indi<i>c</i>ation of Queen
Cleopatra<i>'</i>s good <i>w</i>ill and good faith.

137
00:19:46,513 --> 00:19:48,845
What does Octavian want ?

138
00:19:48,948 --> 00:19:50,916
Marc Antony.

139
00:19:55,054 --> 00:19:58,785
The, uh,
head of Marc Antony ?

140
00:20:16,442 --> 00:20:19,809
Take this to him
as my answer.

141
00:20:21,481 --> 00:20:24,006
Egyptian generosity.

142
00:20:24,117 --> 00:20:27,917
Octavian may have two heads
for the price of one.

143
00:20:28,021 --> 00:20:31,855
Either two... or none.

144
00:21:19,772 --> 00:21:22,434
I've been told
you come here to sleep.

145
00:21:23,977 --> 00:21:28,141
- Not to sleep.
- To pass the night then.

146
00:21:28,248 --> 00:21:30,148
I'm not alone.

147
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:35,415
The, uh-- The old boy and I
exchange memories of life.

148
00:21:35,521 --> 00:21:39,048
It's like having a roommate,
or should I say... tomb-mate ?

149
00:21:39,158 --> 00:21:44,027
If he were in your place, would I fiind
Caesar here, do you think, hidden away,

150
00:21:44,130 --> 00:21:47,224
<i>w</i>rapped in moonlight
and endless self-pity?

151
00:21:47,333 --> 00:21:50,393
Self-pity again ! You repeat yourself!
Find new reproaches for me.

152
00:21:50,503 --> 00:21:53,939
Until now it has just been
a part of your being drunk.

153
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:56,133
Singing sad songs
for Antony.

154
00:21:56,242 --> 00:22:00,201
Your time would be better spent, it
seems to me, negotiating with Octavian.

155
00:22:02,181 --> 00:22:05,378
Why did you not give
my head to Agrippa ?
It would be no great loss to me.

156
00:22:05,485 --> 00:22:07,385
Dying the second time
is painless, they say,

157
00:22:07,487 --> 00:22:09,512
and possibly
a great advantage to you,

158
00:22:09,622 --> 00:22:12,318
the basis, perhaps,
of a great new alliance with Rome.

159
00:22:12,425 --> 00:22:16,725
- I do not want a great
new alliance with Rome.
- Then what do you want ?

160
00:22:18,798 --> 00:22:21,028
I have come for Marc Antony.

161
00:22:21,134 --> 00:22:24,069
What is left of his army,
Rufiio, my son and I,

162
00:22:24,170 --> 00:22:27,469
all of Egypt
are waiting for him.

163
00:22:27,573 --> 00:22:30,269
There is little time.

164
00:22:30,376 --> 00:22:33,243
Marc Antony ?

165
00:22:33,346 --> 00:22:38,340
There is no one here
by that name... alive.

166
00:22:57,603 --> 00:22:59,537
Time for <i>w</i>hat ?

167
00:23:01,007 --> 00:23:03,805
For Marc Antony
to appear in shiny armor,

168
00:23:03,910 --> 00:23:06,037
swords flashing
in both hands ?

169
00:23:06,145 --> 00:23:08,306
Pfft, Agrippa.
Pfft, Octavian.

170
00:23:08,414 --> 00:23:12,714
Stand back ! Rejoice !
Marc Antony will save the day !

171
00:23:19,425 --> 00:23:21,518
Antony, you say ?

172
00:23:21,627 --> 00:23:26,360
He died at Actium,
running away.

173
00:23:26,466 --> 00:23:30,334
He tried to run on the water,
the story goes, but you were
not there to hold his hand.

174
00:23:36,976 --> 00:23:40,969
Rufiio, my legions,
waiting.

175
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:42,980
For what ?

176
00:23:43,082 --> 00:23:46,984
To ask of me what they carry
in their eyes, in their hearts,
in their sleep at night...

177
00:23:47,086 --> 00:23:48,986
as I have in mine.

178
00:23:49,088 --> 00:23:51,852
Why are you not dead ?

179
00:23:51,958 --> 00:23:53,858
Why do you live ?
How can you live ?

180
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:57,191
Why do you not lie
in the deepest hole of the sea,

181
00:23:57,296 --> 00:24:01,130
bloodless and bloated and
at peace with honorable death ?

182
00:24:09,275 --> 00:24:13,803
You... begged forgiveness
from me for running away.

183
00:24:13,913 --> 00:24:17,781
You wept and gave your reason. A mother
to her child, a queen to her country.

184
00:24:17,884 --> 00:24:20,910
Where and how can I weep
and beg ? From whom ?

185
00:24:21,020 --> 00:24:24,512
The thousands and thousands
who can no longer hear me ?

186
00:24:27,260 --> 00:24:29,728
Shall I give my reason ?

187
00:24:29,829 --> 00:24:32,730
Shall I say simply...
I loved ?

188
00:24:34,634 --> 00:24:39,230
When <i>I</i> sa<i>w</i> you go, <i>I</i> sa<i>w</i>
nothing-- felt, heard, thought
nothing ex<i>c</i>ept your going.

189
00:24:39,338 --> 00:24:42,171
Not the dying and dead,
not Rome, not Egypt,

190
00:24:42,275 --> 00:24:45,369
not victory or defeat, honor or
disgrace, friend, enemy, future or past,

191
00:24:45,478 --> 00:24:48,606
only that my love was going
and that I must be with her.

192
00:24:48,714 --> 00:24:51,239
That my love,
my master called.

193
00:24:51,350 --> 00:24:53,545
And <i>I</i> follo<i>w</i>ed.

194
00:24:53,653 --> 00:24:56,281
And that only then,

195
00:24:56,389 --> 00:24:59,324
I looked back...

196
00:24:59,425 --> 00:25:01,325
and I saw.

197
00:25:13,539 --> 00:25:15,473
How right you were.

198
00:25:15,575 --> 00:25:21,377
'' Have as your master
anyone, anything...

199
00:25:21,481 --> 00:25:23,506
but never love.''

200
00:25:23,616 --> 00:25:26,847
How wrong--

201
00:25:26,953 --> 00:25:30,116
How wrong I was.

202
00:25:30,223 --> 00:25:34,023
Antony, the love
you followed is here.

203
00:25:34,126 --> 00:25:37,357
To be had
upon payment of an empire.

204
00:25:37,463 --> 00:25:40,125
Without you, Antony,

205
00:25:40,233 --> 00:25:42,861
this is not a world
I want to live in,

206
00:25:42,969 --> 00:25:46,837
mu<i>c</i>h less <i>c</i>on<i>q</i>uer.

207
00:25:46,939 --> 00:25:50,136
Because for me...

208
00:25:50,243 --> 00:25:53,474
there would be
no love anywhere.

209
00:25:55,581 --> 00:25:59,039
Do you want me to die
with you ? I will.

210
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:03,182
Or do you <i>w</i>ant me
to live <i>w</i>ith you ?

211
00:26:05,424 --> 00:26:07,324
Whatever you choose.

212
00:26:21,474 --> 00:26:25,706
Are we too late, do you think,
if we choose to live ?

213
00:26:25,811 --> 00:26:28,439
Better too late...

214
00:26:28,548 --> 00:26:30,778
than never.

215
00:27:29,976 --> 00:27:33,275
[ Apollodorus ] <i>M</i>y lady, there is
disturbing ne<i>w</i>s from the <i>c</i>ity.

216
00:27:33,379 --> 00:27:37,679
The people are frightened. Some are
beginning to leave their homes.

217
00:27:37,783 --> 00:27:41,651
During the night, hundreds of notices
were secretly posted everywhere.

218
00:27:41,754 --> 00:27:44,552
They were found this morning
stuck up in the marketplace,

219
00:27:44,657 --> 00:27:47,820
even painted on the walls of temples
and other holy places.

220
00:27:47,927 --> 00:27:53,229
Signed by Octavian Caius
Julius Caesar Augustus,

221
00:27:53,332 --> 00:27:57,428
promising the Egyptian people
peace if they surrender to him...

222
00:27:57,536 --> 00:27:59,436
and destruction
if they do not.

223
00:27:59,538 --> 00:28:01,938
I've had all
of the notices removed...

224
00:28:02,041 --> 00:28:05,169
and I've ordered the death penalty for
anyone who spreads the false rumors...

225
00:28:05,277 --> 00:28:07,677
that Lord Antony's men
might desert him.

226
00:28:07,780 --> 00:28:12,683
And what penalty if the rumors
might come true ?

227
00:28:14,286 --> 00:28:16,186
How do you know ?

228
00:28:16,288 --> 00:28:18,381
I know the Romans.

229
00:28:18,491 --> 00:28:21,858
There is only one commander
they will never desert.

230
00:28:21,961 --> 00:28:24,486
His name... is Victory.

231
00:28:24,597 --> 00:28:28,727
But yet,just now, you let
Lord Antony go as if--

232
00:28:33,973 --> 00:28:37,875
If you could have seen him,
how proud he was,

233
00:28:37,977 --> 00:28:39,877
unafraid,

234
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:44,142
as he used to be.

235
00:28:44,250 --> 00:28:46,150
All of my attendants--

236
00:28:46,252 --> 00:28:48,914
Have they been given their freedom ?
Have they gone ?

237
00:28:49,021 --> 00:28:52,081
Yes. They wanted
once more to tidy up.

238
00:28:52,191 --> 00:28:55,126
Octavian can do
his own housecleaning.

239
00:28:55,227 --> 00:28:59,288
The captain of the guards
and three of his best men
are to report to me at once,

240
00:28:59,398 --> 00:29:01,423
disguised as merchants.

241
00:29:01,534 --> 00:29:05,595
They are to escort
Caesarion out of Egypt,

242
00:29:05,705 --> 00:29:08,333
for the time being.

243
00:29:08,441 --> 00:29:12,537
And you ?
Your Majesty, please reconsider.

244
00:29:12,645 --> 00:29:15,978
There are two of Euphranor's ships,
very fast, in the East Harbor.

245
00:29:16,082 --> 00:29:19,916
And would you roll me
on board in a carpet ?

246
00:29:20,019 --> 00:29:21,919
No.

247
00:29:22,021 --> 00:29:26,583
There are no more Caesars to go to,
at least not for me.

248
00:29:26,692 --> 00:29:31,220
- Then it is still your intention to--
- To remain in Alexandria.

249
00:29:31,330 --> 00:29:35,391
In the last possible place
anyone would look.

250
00:29:35,501 --> 00:29:39,597
Literally,
the last possible place.

251
00:29:39,705 --> 00:29:44,938
- Your Majesty, I have never
questioned your decisions.
- This is not the time to begin.

252
00:29:45,044 --> 00:29:49,708
- Let me stay with you.
- Charmian and Eiras will look after me.

253
00:29:49,815 --> 00:29:51,715
If Lord Antony should--

254
00:29:53,819 --> 00:29:57,016
When Lord Antony returns,

255
00:29:57,123 --> 00:30:00,286
you will be here to tell him
where to fiind me...

00:30:00,392 --> 00:30:03,020
<i>w</i>aiting for him.

257
00:30:03,129 --> 00:30:07,691
Together, we will then do...
what he thinks best.

258
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:09,700
Is that clear ?

259
00:30:12,705 --> 00:30:16,641
- Yes, my lady.
- Was there anything more ?

260
00:30:18,477 --> 00:30:20,377
I have always
loved you.

261
00:30:21,981 --> 00:30:24,074
And I have always known.

262
00:30:36,695 --> 00:30:39,061
Rome has never known
such an army.

263
00:30:39,165 --> 00:30:41,599
We should be taking on
the combined powers of Asia.

264
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:44,965
It seems almost a waste
of time to slaughter what's
left of Antony's army...

265
00:30:45,070 --> 00:30:47,595
- and what's left of Antony.
- There will be no slaughter.

266
00:30:47,706 --> 00:30:50,174
I doubt there will
be even bloodshed.

267
00:30:50,276 --> 00:30:55,043
Has a battle ever been won without
a blow being struck ? I wonder.

268
00:30:55,147 --> 00:30:58,480
At any rate, let me
make it clear once more.

269
00:30:58,584 --> 00:31:02,384
I want Antony alive,
and I want her alive.

270
00:31:02,488 --> 00:31:05,184
She must be taken alive.

271
00:31:08,260 --> 00:31:13,926
Queen Cleopatra's second procession
into Rome will surpass her fiirst.

272
00:31:26,478 --> 00:31:30,005
The ring
your father gave you,

273
00:31:30,115 --> 00:31:34,347
it is yours now...
to keep.

274
00:31:34,453 --> 00:31:38,822
Wear it with pride
and with honor.

275
00:31:38,924 --> 00:31:42,883
I'm afraid.
I know I shouldn't be.

276
00:31:42,995 --> 00:31:45,327
Who told you that ?

277
00:31:45,431 --> 00:31:50,528
All kings and
especially queens are afraid.

278
00:31:50,636 --> 00:31:53,764
They just manage
not to show it,

279
00:31:53,873 --> 00:31:56,865
something ordinary people
cannot do.

280
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:58,732
Hail... Antony !

281
00:33:20,926 --> 00:33:24,362
- How near is Octavian ?
- Very near. Over that low ridge.

282
00:33:24,463 --> 00:33:28,058
As it grows darker, the glow from
his campfiires will light up the sky.

283

attractive to watch.

284
00:33:37,042 --> 00:33:39,442
Inviting, even.

285
00:33:39,545 --> 00:33:42,742
Antony's legions warm themselves
at their own fiires.

286
00:33:42,848 --> 00:33:47,717
Yes. I could feel
the warmth as I rode by.

287
00:33:49,555 --> 00:33:51,489
- How many legions has he ?
- Twenty.

288
00:33:51,590 --> 00:33:54,525
- And we ?
- Two. The 1 2th and one made up from--

289
00:33:54,626 --> 00:33:57,254
Made up from what was left
of the others.

290
00:33:57,363 --> 00:34:02,198
As I remember it, Caesar
held Alexandria with two.

291

How are they deployed ?

00:34:11,477 --> 00:34:16,244
Cavalry to the left, cavalry
to the right, infantry to the center.

to stamp out a fly.

No. Let the elephants stand.

By sunset both our loyal legions
will have grown larger...

will you, yourself,
wake me ?

- Then I will. Never fear.

00:44:17,682 --> 00:44:21,675
Cleopatra is out of reach...

342
00:44:21,786 --> 00:44:25,085
and I must hurry after.

343
00:44:25,190 --> 00:44:27,385
Throughout life...

344
00:44:27,492 --> 00:44:29,392
and now beyond.

345
00:44:29,494 --> 00:44:33,521

346

349
00:44:58,223 --> 00:45:03,889
- Help me to die, Apollodorus !
- I want to ! But I can't.

350
00:45:19,778 --> 00:45:23,839
I've always
envied Rufiio his...

351
00:45:23,948 --> 00:45:25,848

352
00:45:44,102 --> 00:45:46,798
The ultimate desertion--

353

I must have aimed for all my life ?

355

Will you fiinish me now ?

356
00:45:58,983 --> 00:46:03,147
Where is my sword ?
I beg you to fiinish me.

357
00:46:03,254 --> 00:46:05,916
I lied to you.
I let you think the queen is dead.

358
00:46:06,024 --> 00:46:08,549
But she's alive in her tomb,
waiting for you.

360
00:46:13,965 --> 00:46:16,559

361
00:46:16,668 --> 00:46:18,693
just enough time...

362
00:46:18,803 --> 00:46:20,703

363
00:47:20,698 --> 00:47:24,134
Perhaps, my lady, if we were
to bind his wounds tightly--

364
00:47:24,235 --> 00:47:28,695
It would only give him pain.
Let him sleep.

365
00:47:40,919 --> 00:47:42,819

367

368
00:47:50,161 --> 00:47:52,061

But not for very long,
I promise.

I would die...

375
00:48:17,088 --> 00:48:19,989

I thought, in death.

As simply as that.

Shake with terror when

for fear they be untrue and
Antony cut out your tongue for the lie.
