00:02:56,125 --> 00:02:59,151
Listen to her how I and roar.

3
00:03:00,829 --> 00:03:02,160
Metal under tension...

4
00:03:02,197 --> 00:03:04,893
beggin' you to touch and go.

5
00:03:06,735 --> 00:03:11,672
Highway to the danger zone.

6
00:03:12,908 --> 00:03:17,572
Ride into the danger zone.

7
00:03:22,117 --> 00:03:23,550
Headin' into twilight...

8
00:03:23,585 --> 00:03:26,053
spreadin' out her wings tonight.

9
00:03:27,489 --> 00:03:29,548
She's got you

10
00:03:29,591 --> 00:03:32,253
shovin' into overdrive.

11
00:03:34,396 --> 00:03:38,799
Highway to the danger zone.

00:03:40,035 --> 00:03:45,439
I'II take you

13
00:04:02,091 --> 00:04:06,425
Highway to the danger zone.

14
00:04:07,496 --> 00:04:09,521
Gonna take you
right into the danger zone.

15
00:04:09,565 --> 00:04:11,032
Good morning, Scott.

16
00:04:11,066 --> 00:04:12,033
Morning, Willis.

17
00:04:12,067 --> 00:04:13,557
How are you?

18
00:04:16,939 --> 00:04:18,531
Ghost Rider, this is strike.

19
00:04:18,574 --> 00:04:20,064
We have unknown aircraft.

20
00:04:20,109 --> 00:04:21,576
Inbound, Mustang.

21
00:04:21,610 --> 00:04:24,511
You're vector zero-nine-zero
for bogey.

22
00:04:33,956 --> 00:04:35,423
Who's up there?

23
00:04:35,457 --> 00:04:38,426
Cougar and Merlin
and Maverick and Goose.

24
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:40,087
Great.

25
00:04:40,129 --> 00:04:41,756
Maverick and Goose.

26
00:04:50,305 --> 00:04:52,102
Talk to me, Goose.

27
00:04:52,141 --> 00:04:53,574
Roger. I got him.

28
00:04:53,609 --> 00:04:55,372
Contact, 20 left at 30 miles.

29
00:04:55,411 --> 00:04:56,605
Nine hundred knots closure.

30
00:04:56,645 --> 00:04:58,476
Cougar, you hear that?

31
00:04:58,514 --> 00:05:00,311
Roger.

32
00:05:00,349 --> 00:05:01,509
Merlin, you got him?

33
00:05:01,550 --> 00:05:03,780
Roger. I've got radar contact.

34
00:05:03,819 --> 00:05:05,946
I'II get a visual.
Cougar, you hook them.

35
00:05:05,988 --> 00:05:09,424
Roger. And I'II clean them
and fry them. Ha ha.

36
00:05:15,264 --> 00:05:17,892
Mustang.
Mustang, this is Ghost Rider.

37
00:05:17,933 --> 00:05:19,901
Two-zero-three.
I've got him inbound.

38
00:05:19,935 --> 00:05:23,894
Bogey heading two-seven-zero
at 10 miles.

39
00:05:23,939 --> 00:05:25,406
Nine hundred knots closure.

40
00:05:25,441 --> 00:05:28,376
Ghost Rider,
take angels 10-Ieft-three-zero.

41
00:05:28,410 --> 00:05:30,401
Are we supposed to have
visitors today?

42
00:05:30,446 --> 00:05:31,435
Negative, sir.

43
00:05:38,887 --> 00:05:40,354
Merlin, see if he's alone.

44
00:05:40,389 --> 00:05:41,583
Roger.

45
00:05:43,225 --> 00:05:44,749
Goose, you see a trailer?

46
00:05:44,793 --> 00:05:46,693
Negative, Merlin.

47
00:05:46,728 --> 00:05:48,958
Looks like he's a single.

48
00:05:48,997 --> 00:05:51,022
I'm going head-to-head with him.

49
00:05:51,066 --> 00:05:53,330
Take it easy, Maverick.
I don't like this shit.

50
00:05:53,368 --> 00:05:55,928
I'm breaking high right
to see if he's really alone.

51
00:06:15,424 --> 00:06:17,221
We've got
1,000 knots closure, Mav.

52
00:06:17,259 --> 00:06:18,624
He's coming right at us.

53
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:20,525
OK, buddy, what's on your mind?

54
00:06:23,198 --> 00:06:25,359
Holy shit, there's two of them !

55
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:28,096
Whoo! MIG-28s!
No one's been this close before.

56
00:06:28,136 --> 00:06:30,434
What are they doing here?
What's the position?

57
00:06:30,472 --> 00:06:32,497
Two hundred fifty miles out.

58
00:06:32,541 --> 00:06:34,509
Two hundred fifty miles?
Clear them out.

59
00:06:37,145 --> 00:06:38,578
Cougar, you've got MIG-1.

60
00:06:38,614 --> 00:06:40,104
I'm going after MIG-2.

61
00:06:41,183 --> 00:06:44,175
I lost him in the sun.

62
00:06:44,219 --> 00:06:45,743
Shit, what's he doing?

63
00:06:45,787 --> 00:06:47,448
You got him, Merlin?

64
00:06:48,924 --> 00:06:51,154
He's coming around,
right on our tail.

65
00:06:52,961 --> 00:06:54,952
God damn it!
This bogey's all over me.

66
00:06:58,901 --> 00:07:01,096
-What's their range now?
-Two hundred miles, sir.

67
00:07:01,136 --> 00:07:04,503
If they break 150 miles,
launch the alert-five aircraft.

68
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:05,529
OFFICER: Yes, sir.

69
00:07:07,876 --> 00:07:09,434
Air speed 300. Get him, Mav!

70
00:07:09,478 --> 00:07:11,412
I'm going for missile lock.

71
00:07:12,581 --> 00:07:14,572
Let's scare this guy
out of here.

72
00:07:15,584 --> 00:07:17,074
Come on, lockup, baby.

73
00:07:17,586 --> 00:07:19,053
Lockup, baby.

74
00:07:19,087 --> 00:07:20,213
Lockup.

75
00:07:20,255 --> 00:07:21,722
I got him locked.

76
00:07:21,757 --> 00:07:22,746
Bingo!

77
00:07:27,129 --> 00:07:28,858
We got him, Mav.

78
00:07:28,897 --> 00:07:30,421
He's bugging out and going home.

79
00:07:30,465 --> 00:07:33,263
Mustang, this is Maverick.
MIG-2 is headed home.

80
00:07:34,703 --> 00:07:36,000
What's their position?

81
00:07:36,038 --> 00:07:38,973
One hundred eighty miles,
bearing zero-one-zero, sir.

82
00:07:41,076 --> 00:07:42,407
[Beep]

83
00:07:42,444 --> 00:07:43,877
Cougar,
He's got missile lock on us!

84
00:07:43,912 --> 00:07:45,174
Get away from this guy!

85
00:07:45,213 --> 00:07:47,340
What is this shit?
He's engaging me.

86
00:07:49,518 --> 00:07:51,418
Damn it, Mustang,
this is Ghost Rider.

87
00:07:51,453 --> 00:07:54,422
This bogey's all over me.
He's got missile lock on me.

88
00:07:54,456 --> 00:07:55,821
Permission to fire?

89
00:07:55,857 --> 00:07:57,984
Don't fire until fired upon.

90
00:08:00,295 --> 00:08:01,785
Goose, there they are below us.

91
00:08:01,830 --> 00:08:03,889
The MIG's in perfect
firing position.

92
00:08:03,932 --> 00:08:05,399
He's right on Cougar's tail.

93
00:08:05,434 --> 00:08:07,265
No way, Goose.
He'd have fired already.

94
00:08:07,302 --> 00:08:08,826
He's trying to piss us off.

95
00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:11,566
Maverick, get down here
and get this asshole off me.

96
00:08:14,142 --> 00:08:15,837
Easy, Cougar.

97
00:08:15,877 --> 00:08:17,868
Bring him back. Hard right.

98
00:08:17,913 --> 00:08:19,403
Help me engage.

99
00:08:20,616 --> 00:08:21,947
I'm on my way.

100
00:08:39,101 --> 00:08:42,195
Can't shoot this son of a bitch.
Let's try having some fun.

101
00:08:47,776 --> 00:08:49,937
Is this your idea of fun, Mav?

102
00:08:53,181 --> 00:08:54,341
Greetings.

103
00:08:57,452 --> 00:08:58,942
Watch the birdie.

104
00:09:00,589 --> 00:09:01,954
Jeez, I crack myself up.

105
00:09:09,431 --> 00:09:13,231
This is a great shot, Mav.
I should be a photographer.

106
00:09:13,268 --> 00:09:15,594
Cougar...

107
00:09:15,727 --> 00:09:16,694
your tail is clear.

108
00:09:16,761 --> 00:09:17,596
MIG-1 has bugged out.

109
00:09:17,596 --> 00:09:18,028
MIG-1 has bugged out.

110
00:09:20,132 --> 00:09:22,123
[Breathing erratically]

111
00:09:27,572 --> 00:09:29,631
Cougar, this is Maverick.

112
00:09:29,674 --> 00:09:32,507
We've had enough fun
for one day, don't you think?

113
00:09:32,544 --> 00:09:35,707
I'm getting a little low
on fuel, so we're heading home.

114
00:09:38,984 --> 00:09:40,542
We'll see you on deck.

115
00:09:49,828 --> 00:09:52,228
We're running Low on gas.
We've gotta get out of here.

116
00:09:52,964 --> 00:09:54,659
[Beeping]

117
00:09:54,699 --> 00:09:56,064
Cougar.

118
00:09:58,403 --> 00:10:00,371
We're on vapor, Cougar.

119
00:10:00,405 --> 00:10:02,066
Let's do it.

120
00:10:04,409 --> 00:10:05,899
Cougar! Come on, Cougar!

121
00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:16,885
MERLIN: Take it back
to the ship, man.

122
00:10:16,922 --> 00:10:18,048
Come on, Cougar.

123
00:10:18,089 --> 00:10:20,216
Get him on deck
as soon as possible.

124
00:10:20,258 --> 00:10:21,953
He's gotta be Low on fuel.

125
00:10:24,062 --> 00:10:26,053
Cougar, we've got to land
this thing.

126
00:10:26,097 --> 00:10:29,533
We are way Low on gas,
you understand me?

127
00:10:29,568 --> 00:10:31,433
You all right, man?

128
00:10:37,976 --> 00:10:41,207
CONTROL: Maverick, you're at
3/4 of a mile. Call the ball.

129
00:10:41,246 --> 00:10:43,009
Roger. Maverick has the ball.

130
00:10:44,849 --> 00:10:45,975
MERLIN: Cougar, let's Land!

131
00:10:46,017 --> 00:10:48,110
Goose, Cougar's in trouble.

132
00:10:48,153 --> 00:10:50,087
Come on, Mav,
we're gettin' Low on gas.

133
00:10:50,121 --> 00:10:51,782
Let's Land this sucker.

134
00:10:53,525 --> 00:10:54,514
MERLIN: Cougar!

135
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:03,267
God damn it, Maverick.

136
00:11:03,301 --> 00:11:05,201
We got no fuel for this.

137
00:11:05,237 --> 00:11:06,568
We're going after Cougar.

138
00:11:08,173 --> 00:11:11,142
You tell him to land that plane.
That's an order.

139
00:11:11,176 --> 00:11:14,043
CONTROL: Ghost Rider,
you are instructed to land.

140
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:15,410
Land immediately.

141
00:11:19,918 --> 00:11:23,183
Any of you boys seen
an aircraft carrier around here?

142
00:11:23,221 --> 00:11:25,883
Mav, we've got a little problem
up here.

143
00:11:25,924 --> 00:11:27,448
That MIG really screwed him up.

144
00:11:27,492 --> 00:11:29,619
I don't think
he can make it back.

145
00:11:32,397 --> 00:11:33,728
You're OK, Cougar.

146
00:11:33,765 --> 00:11:35,733
Just stay on my wing.

147
00:11:35,767 --> 00:11:37,860
I'II take you all the way in.

148
00:11:37,902 --> 00:11:39,233
Just stay with me.

149
00:11:53,952 --> 00:11:56,944
Easy, Cougar.
Just a walk in the park, buddy.

150
00:11:58,290 --> 00:11:59,757
You're a Little Low.

151
00:11:59,791 --> 00:12:02,487
You're a Little Low, Coug.

152
00:12:02,527 --> 00:12:04,461
Come on, buddy. Pull up.

153
00:12:05,730 --> 00:12:07,220
MAVERICK: Pull up, Cougar.

154
00:12:08,733 --> 00:12:09,893
That's it.

155
00:12:09,934 --> 00:12:11,231
Almost there.

156
00:12:12,404 --> 00:12:14,372
CONTROL: You're well below
glide path.

157
00:12:14,406 --> 00:12:16,601
Three quarters of a mile.
Call the ball.

158
00:12:18,243 --> 00:12:19,267
Roger ball.

159
00:12:29,621 --> 00:12:31,111
MERLIN: We're too Low, Cougar.

160
00:12:31,156 --> 00:12:32,555
We're too Low, Cougar.

161
00:12:32,590 --> 00:12:33,716
Pull up!

162
00:12:33,758 --> 00:12:35,248
Some more power!

163
00:12:36,261 --> 00:12:37,751
Come on, pull again!

164
00:12:47,939 --> 00:12:49,270
AIR BOSS JOHNSON: Come in.

165
00:12:51,609 --> 00:12:52,576
Sir.

166
00:12:52,610 --> 00:12:55,078
Cougar,
you should be in sick bay.

167
00:12:55,113 --> 00:12:56,410
What's on your mind?

168
00:12:56,448 --> 00:12:57,642
My wife and kid, sir.

169
00:12:58,850 --> 00:13:00,943
Almost orphaned him today,
without ever seeing him.

170
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:04,818
I don't know what happened
up there...

171
00:13:04,856 --> 00:13:06,483
but I was so scared.

172
00:13:06,524 --> 00:13:08,355
Come on, we've seen this before.

173
00:13:08,393 --> 00:13:09,382
No, sir.

174
00:13:11,229 --> 00:13:13,424
I'm holding on too tight.

175
00:13:13,465 --> 00:13:15,228
I've lost the edge.

176
00:13:15,266 --> 00:13:17,291
I'm sorry, sir.

177
00:13:19,170 --> 00:13:20,569
I'm sorry.

178
00:13:27,245 --> 00:13:28,405
Cougar.

179
00:13:31,416 --> 00:13:32,747
Thanks, Maverick.

180
00:13:35,086 --> 00:13:37,714
JOHNSON:
Maverick, Goose, come in here.

00:13:37,756 --> 00:13:39,724
MAVERICK:
What the hell's going on?

182
00:13:39,758 --> 00:13:40,782
I don't know.

183
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:42,918
Oh, shit.

184
00:13:47,265 --> 00:13:50,257
Maverick, you just did
an incredibly brave thing.

185
00:13:52,237 --> 00:13:55,229
What you should have done
was Land your plane!

186
00:13:55,273 --> 00:13:57,241
You don't own that plane...

187
00:13:57,275 --> 00:13:58,936
the taxpayers do!

188
00:13:58,977 --> 00:14:02,105
Son, your ego is writing checks
your body can't cash.

189
00:14:02,147 --> 00:14:03,705
You've been busted...

190
00:14:03,748 --> 00:14:07,184
you lost your qualifications
as section leader three times...

191
00:14:07,218 --> 00:14:09,709
put in hack twice by me...

192
00:14:09,754 --> 00:14:12,018
with a history
of high-speed passes...

193
00:14:12,056 --> 00:14:14,388
over five air control towers...

194
00:14:14,426 --> 00:14:15,916
and one admiral's daughter!

195
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:17,484
Penny Benjamin?

196
00:14:18,563 --> 00:14:19,825
And you, asshole...

197
00:14:19,864 --> 00:14:21,729
you're Lucky to be here.

198
00:14:21,766 --> 00:14:22,960
Thank you, sir.

199
00:14:23,001 --> 00:14:24,468
And Let's not bullshit,
Maverick.

200
00:14:24,502 --> 00:14:26,970
Your family name
isn't the best in the Navy.

201
00:14:27,005 --> 00:14:29,974
You need to be doing it better
and cleaner than the rest.

202
00:14:30,008 --> 00:14:31,407
Now, what is it with you?

203
00:14:31,443 --> 00:14:35,004
Just want to serve my country,
be the best pilot in the Navy.

204
00:14:35,046 --> 00:14:36,741
Don't screw around with me,
Maverick.

205
00:14:36,781 --> 00:14:38,806
You're a hell of
an instinctive pilot.

206
00:14:38,850 --> 00:14:40,044
Maybe too good.

207
00:14:40,084 --> 00:14:42,211
I'd like to bust you,
but I can't.

208
00:14:42,253 --> 00:14:43,811
I got another problem here.

209
00:14:43,855 --> 00:14:47,985
I got to send somebody
from this squadron to Miramar.

210
00:14:48,026 --> 00:14:49,755
I've got to do something here.

211
00:14:49,794 --> 00:14:51,762
I still can't believe it.

212
00:14:51,796 --> 00:14:53,764
I got to give you
your dream shot.

213
00:14:53,798 --> 00:14:56,062
I'm gonna send you up
against the best.

214
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:59,934
You two characters
are going to Top Gun.

215
00:15:01,539 --> 00:15:03,473
For five weeks...

216
00:15:03,508 --> 00:15:05,100
you will fly against the best
fighter pilots in the world.

217
00:15:05,143 --> 00:15:07,771
You were number two.
Cougar was number one.

218
00:15:07,812 --> 00:15:10,110
Cougar lost it,
turned in his wings.

219
00:15:10,148 --> 00:15:11,945
You guys are number one.

220
00:15:13,451 --> 00:15:15,419
But you remember one thing--

221
00:15:15,453 --> 00:15:17,717
you screw up just this much...

222
00:15:17,755 --> 00:15:20,724
you'll be flying a cargo plane
full of rubber dog shit...

223
00:15:20,758 --> 00:15:22,191
out of Hong Kong.

224
00:15:22,227 --> 00:15:23,251
Yes, sir!

225
00:15:27,265 --> 00:15:29,096
That is all.

226
00:15:29,133 --> 00:15:31,533
You can tell me about the MIG
some other time.

227
00:15:31,569 --> 00:15:32,558
Gentlemen!

228
00:15:33,571 --> 00:15:35,061
Good Luck, gentlemen.

229
00:15:35,106 --> 00:15:36,573
-Thank you, sir.
-Thank you.

230
00:15:42,604 --> 00:15:43,730
SONG: Out along the edge...

231
00:15:43,772 --> 00:15:46,297
is always where I burn to be.

232
00:15:48,777 --> 00:15:52,736
The further on the edge,
the hotter the intensity.

233
00:15:54,916 --> 00:15:59,410
Highway to the danger zone.

234
00:16:00,088 --> 00:16:05,651
Gonna take you
right into the danger zone.

235
00:16:07,229 --> 00:16:12,360
Highway to the danger zone.

236
00:16:13,335 --> 00:16:18,796
Right into the danger zone...

237
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:21,866
During Korea,
the Navy kill ratio was 12 to 1.

238
00:16:21,910 --> 00:16:24,344
We shot down 12 of their jets
for every one of ours.

239
00:16:24,379 --> 00:16:27,177
During Vietnam,
that ratio fell to 3 to 1.

240
00:16:27,215 --> 00:16:29,877
Our pilots had become dependent
upon missiles.

241
00:16:29,918 --> 00:16:31,476
They had lost some
of their dogfighting skills.

242
00:16:32,487 --> 00:16:34,648
Now, Top Gun was created
to teach ACM--

243
00:16:34,689 --> 00:16:36,179
Air Combat Maneuvering.

244
00:16:36,792 --> 00:16:38,020
Dogfighting.

245
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:39,618
This gives me a hard-on.

246
00:16:39,661 --> 00:16:42,562
By Vietnam's end,
that ratio was back to 12 to 1.

247
00:16:42,597 --> 00:16:43,621
Don't tease me.

248
00:16:43,665 --> 00:16:44,791
Blinds, please.

249
00:16:44,833 --> 00:16:47,666
I'd like to take this
opportunity to introduce you...

250
00:16:47,702 --> 00:16:49,533
to our commanding officer
at Top Gun.

251
00:16:49,571 --> 00:16:51,801
The first man awarded
the Top Gun trophy.

252
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:54,206
You will not find
a finer fighter pilot...

253
00:16:54,242 --> 00:16:55,709
anywhere in the world.

254
00:16:55,744 --> 00:16:58,542
Commander Mike Metcalf.
Call sign, Viper.

255

Gentlemen...

256
00:17:01,450 --> 00:17:05,853
You are the top one percent
of all naval aviators.

257
00:17:08,023 --> 00:17:09,251
The elite.

258
00:17:09,291 --> 00:17:11,350
The best of the best.

259
00:17:11,393 --> 00:17:13,361
We'll make you better.

260
00:17:14,696 --> 00:17:16,926
You'll fly at Least
two combat missions a day...

261
00:17:16,965 --> 00:17:18,660
attend classes in between...

262
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:20,725
and evaluations
of your performance.

263
00:17:20,769 --> 00:17:22,464
In each combat sequence...

264
00:17:22,504 --> 00:17:24,165
you're gonna meet
a different challenge.

265
00:17:24,206 --> 00:17:27,300
Every encounter is going
to be much more difficult.

266
00:17:27,342 --> 00:17:29,606
We're gonna teach you
to fly the F-14...

267
00:17:29,644 --> 00:17:31,134
right to the edge
of the envelope...

268
00:17:31,179 --> 00:17:33,044
faster than
you've ever flown before...

269
00:17:33,081 --> 00:17:34,639
and more dangerous.

270
00:17:35,317 --> 00:17:37,911
Now, we don't make policy here,
gentlemen.

271
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:42,178
Elected officials,
civilians do that.

272
00:17:42,224 --> 00:17:44,215
We are the instruments
of that policy.

273
00:17:45,227 --> 00:17:47,695
And although we're not at war...

274
00:17:47,729 --> 00:17:50,197
we must always act
as though we are at war.

275
00:17:50,232 --> 00:17:51,699
GOOSE: What are you doing?

276
00:17:51,733 --> 00:17:53,496
MAVERICK: Just wondering...

277
00:17:53,535 --> 00:17:55,093
who's the best.

278
00:17:55,137 --> 00:17:57,867
In case some of you wonder
who the best is...

279
00:17:57,906 --> 00:18:00,374
they're up here on this plaque.

280
00:18:00,408 --> 00:18:03,502
The best driver and his R.I.O.
from each class is on it.

281
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:07,341
And they have the option...

282
00:18:07,382 --> 00:18:09,475
to return here
to be Top Gun instructors.

283
00:18:11,653 --> 00:18:14,645
You think your name's
gonna be on that plaque?

284
00:18:16,258 --> 00:18:17,350
Yes, sir.

285
00:18:17,392 --> 00:18:20,486
That's arrogant, considering
the company you're in.

286
00:18:24,366 --> 00:18:25,731
Yes, sir.

287
00:18:25,767 --> 00:18:28,497
I like that in a pilot.

288
00:18:29,704 --> 00:18:31,433
Just remember,
when it's over out there...

289
00:18:31,473 --> 00:18:32,804
we're all on the same team.

290
00:18:36,711 --> 00:18:39,271
Gentlemen,
this school is about combat.

291
00:18:39,314 --> 00:18:42,181
There are no points
for second place.

292
00:18:43,451 --> 00:18:44,679
Dismissed.

293
00:18:44,719 --> 00:18:45,879
Nice going.

294
00:18:48,723 --> 00:18:50,691
The plaque for the alternates...

295
00:18:50,725 --> 00:18:52,920

00:18:57,465 --> 00:19:00,025
Oh, you kill me. You really do.

301
00:19:13,515 --> 00:19:14,504
Hi.

302
00:19:18,186 --> 00:19:21,644
This is what I call
a target-rich environment.

303
00:19:21,690 --> 00:19:23,954
You Live your Life
between your Legs, Mav.

304
00:19:23,992 --> 00:19:27,052
Goose, even you could get laid
in this place.

305
00:19:27,095 --> 00:19:30,326
I'd be happy to find a girl
who'll talk dirty to me.

306
00:19:34,569 --> 00:19:38,027
Mav, you want to know
who the best is?

307
00:19:38,073 --> 00:19:39,631
That's him. Iceman.

308
00:19:41,509 --> 00:19:44,205
That's the way he flies.
Ice cold. No mistakes.

309
00:19:44,246 --> 00:19:45,679
Just wears you down.

You get bored, frustrated,
do something stupid...

311
00:19:48,016 --> 00:19:49,005
and he's got you.

312
00:19:50,318 --> 00:19:53,913
Hey, Slider, I thought you
wanted to be a pilot, man.

00:19:54,956 --> 00:19:56,150
Goose, you're such a dickhead.

Sorry to hear about Cougar.
We were close in flight school.

That's what I meant.

00:20:26,054 --> 00:20:27,885

No. I can figure that out
on my own.

I heard that about you.

336
00:20:37,766 --> 00:20:39,757
You like to work alone.

under a Lucky star.

into Cougar's spot.

00:21:26,114 --> 00:21:27,775
GOOSE:
Come on, Mav. A bet's a bet.

359
00:21:28,817 --> 00:21:30,011
I don't know.

360
00:21:30,051 --> 00:21:32,713
It just doesn't seem fair...
for you, I mean.

361
00:21:32,754 --> 00:21:34,085
But, uh...

362
00:21:35,256 --> 00:21:37,224
she's lost that Loving feeling.

363
00:21:37,258 --> 00:21:39,852
-She's Lost--no, she hasn't.
-Yes, she has.

364
00:21:39,894 --> 00:21:41,020
She has not lost that lov--

365
00:21:41,062 --> 00:21:43,053
-Goose, she's lost it.
-Mav, come on.

366
00:21:43,565 --> 00:21:46,261
I hate it when she does that.
Shit.

367
00:21:51,606 --> 00:21:53,005
Excuse me, miss.

368
00:21:53,041 --> 00:21:56,602
Hey, hey. Don't worry.
I'II take care of this.

369
00:21:56,644 --> 00:21:59,238
[Singing]
You never close your eyes...

370
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:03,444
anymore when I kiss your Lips.

371
00:22:04,285 --> 00:22:06,344
There's no tenderness...

372
00:22:06,388 --> 00:22:11,223
Like before in your fingertips.

373
00:22:11,259 --> 00:22:14,717
You're trying hard
not to show it...

374
00:22:14,763 --> 00:22:16,697
CROWD SINGING: Baby...

375
00:22:16,731 --> 00:22:22,363
but, baby, believe me,
I know it.

376
00:22:22,404 --> 00:22:26,864
You've Lost that loving' feeling.

377
00:22:26,908 --> 00:22:31,345
Whoa, that Loving' feeling.

378
00:22:31,379 --> 00:22:34,644
You've Lost that Loving' feeling.

379
00:22:34,682 --> 00:22:38,709
Now it's gone, gone, gone.

380
00:22:38,753 --> 00:22:40,550
Whoa-oh-oh.

381
00:22:40,588 --> 00:22:44,991
Ba dum, ba dum,
ba dum, bum, bum.

382
00:22:45,026 --> 00:22:46,755
Sit down.

383
00:22:46,795 --> 00:22:48,092
Thank you.

384
00:22:49,764 --> 00:22:51,129
Baby, baby...

385
00:22:51,166 --> 00:22:55,000
I'II get down on my knees
for you.

386
00:22:56,438 --> 00:22:58,406
I Love that song.

387
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:00,704
I've never seen that approach.

388
00:23:02,010 --> 00:23:03,671
How long have you two
had this act?

389
00:23:03,711 --> 00:23:05,542
Oh, I don't know. Since...

390
00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:06,706
Puberty?

391
00:23:06,748 --> 00:23:07,874
Right. Puberty.

392
00:23:07,916 --> 00:23:10,282
I'm Charlotte Blackwood.

393
00:23:10,318 --> 00:23:11,546
I'm Maverick.

394
00:23:11,586 --> 00:23:12,575
Maverick?

395
00:23:12,620 --> 00:23:15,214
Did your mother not like you
or something?

396
00:23:15,256 --> 00:23:17,383
No. It's my call sign.

397
00:23:17,425 --> 00:23:19,017
You're a pilot.

398
00:23:19,060 --> 00:23:20,891
That's right. A naval aviator.

399
00:23:20,929 --> 00:23:22,487
Oh.

400
00:23:22,530 --> 00:23:25,226
Actually, we've only done this,
uh, twice.

401
00:23:25,266 --> 00:23:26,563
Oh, how did you do?

402
00:23:28,002 --> 00:23:29,469
Crashed and burned
on the first one.

403
00:23:29,504 --> 00:23:30,698
It wasn't pretty.

404
00:23:31,706 --> 00:23:32,866
And the second?

405
00:23:32,907 --> 00:23:35,205
I don't know.
I'II tell you tomorrow...

406
00:23:35,243 --> 00:23:37,234
but it's Looking good so far.

407
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:40,747
Well, uh...Maverick...

408
00:23:40,782 --> 00:23:43,114
my friend's just arrived...

409
00:23:43,151 --> 00:23:45,119
so it's been
great talking to you.

410
00:23:45,153 --> 00:23:46,245
Perry. Hi.

411
00:23:46,287 --> 00:23:47,584
Hi. Here you go.

412
00:23:47,622 --> 00:23:50,614
I'II be with you
in just a second, OK?

413
00:23:51,793 --> 00:23:56,253
Listen, can I ask you
a personal question?

414
00:23:56,297 --> 00:23:57,628
That depends.

415
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:01,394
Are you a good pilot?

416
00:24:03,238 --> 00:24:04,967
I can hold my own.

417
00:24:05,006 --> 00:24:05,995
Great.

418
00:24:07,008 --> 00:24:10,671
Then I won't have to worry about
you making a Living as a singer.

419
00:24:13,548 --> 00:24:14,537
Hi.

420
00:24:14,582 --> 00:24:16,948
-Here's your drink.
-Thanks.

421
00:24:16,985 --> 00:24:20,352
I'm gonna need a beer
to put these flames out. Yo!

422
00:24:21,523 --> 00:24:24,151
That's great, Mav. Real slick.

423
00:24:48,439 --> 00:24:50,737
It was a Long cruise,
was it, sailor?

424
00:24:50,775 --> 00:24:52,242
It was too long.

425
00:24:52,277 --> 00:24:53,505
What'd you want to do...

426
00:24:53,545 --> 00:24:56,036
just drop down on the tile
and go for it?

427
00:24:56,881 --> 00:25:00,977
No. Actually,
I had this counter in mind.

428
00:25:01,019 --> 00:25:04,182
Great. That would be very,
very comfortable. Yeah.

429
00:25:04,222 --> 00:25:05,712
It could be.

430
00:25:08,393 --> 00:25:10,623
Actually,
I came in here to save you...

431
00:25:10,662 --> 00:25:15,190
from making a big mistake
with that older guy.

432
00:25:15,233 --> 00:25:16,393
Really?

433
00:25:17,335 --> 00:25:21,135
So I could make a bigger one
with a young guy like yourself?

434
00:25:23,741 --> 00:25:24,969
Maybe.

435
00:25:26,678 --> 00:25:29,112
I've got to be at work
early in the morning.

436
00:25:29,147 --> 00:25:31,206
Then what are you doing here?

437
00:25:32,584 --> 00:25:34,074
Your friend was magnificent.

438
00:25:39,757 --> 00:25:41,418
Naw.

439
00:25:43,027 --> 00:25:45,222
JESTER: You'll also be trained
and evaluated...

440
00:25:45,263 --> 00:25:47,197
by a few civilian specialists.

441
00:25:47,232 --> 00:25:48,426
The civilians are here...

442
00:25:48,466 --> 00:25:51,492
because they are our best source
of information on enemy planes.

443
00:25:51,536 --> 00:25:54,505
One of the most qualified
is our T.A.G.R.E.P.--

444
00:25:54,539 --> 00:25:55,904
call sign, Charlie.

445
00:25:55,940 --> 00:25:58,101
She has a Ph.D.
in astrophysics...

446
00:25:58,142 --> 00:26:00,044
and she's also
a civilian contractor...

447
00:26:00,044 --> 00:26:02,877
so you don't salute her,
but you better Listen to her...

448
00:26:02,914 --> 00:26:05,348
because the Pentagon Listens
to her about your proficiency.

449
00:26:05,383 --> 00:26:06,680
It's all yours, Charlie.

450
00:26:06,718 --> 00:26:07,707
Thank you.

451
00:26:09,053 --> 00:26:12,955
Hello. We will be dealing
with F-5s and A-4s...

452
00:26:12,991 --> 00:26:15,118
as our MIG simulators.

453
00:26:15,159 --> 00:26:17,218
Now, then,
as most of you know...

454
00:26:17,262 --> 00:26:20,493
the F-5 doesn't have
the thrust to weight ratio...

455
00:26:20,531 --> 00:26:22,692
that the MIG-28 has...

456
00:26:22,734 --> 00:26:26,693
and it doesn't bleed energy
below 300 knots Like a MIG-28.

457
00:26:26,738 --> 00:26:30,401
However, the MIG-28
does have a problem...

458
00:26:30,441 --> 00:26:32,568
with its inverted flight tanks.

459
00:26:32,610 --> 00:26:35,704
It won't do
a negative ''G'' pushover.

460
00:26:35,747 --> 00:26:37,715
The Latest intelligence
tells us...

461
00:26:37,749 --> 00:26:40,718
that the most it will do
is one negative--

462
00:26:40,752 --> 00:26:43,118
Excuse me, Lieutenant.

463
00:26:43,154 --> 00:26:45,588
Is there something wrong?

464
00:26:45,623 --> 00:26:48,217
Yes, ma'am. The data on
the MIG is inaccurate.

465
00:26:49,494 --> 00:26:51,257
How's that, Lieutenant?

466
00:26:51,296 --> 00:26:54,231
I just happened
to see a MIG-28.

467
00:26:54,265 --> 00:26:55,493
We! We.

468
00:26:55,533 --> 00:26:56,761
Sorry, Goose.

469
00:26:56,801 --> 00:27:00,760
We happened to see a MIG-28
do a four ''G'' negative dive.

470
00:27:02,206 --> 00:27:04,106
Where did you see this?

471
00:27:04,142 --> 00:27:06,235
That's classified.

472
00:27:06,277 --> 00:27:07,244
It's what?

473
00:27:07,278 --> 00:27:09,269
MAVERICK: It's classified.

474
00:27:09,947 --> 00:27:12,006
I could I tell you,
but then I'd have to kill you.

475
00:27:12,050 --> 00:27:15,019
Lieutenant,
I have top-secret clearance.

476
00:27:15,053 --> 00:27:17,954
The Pentagon sees to it
that I know more than you.

477
00:27:19,490 --> 00:27:22,687
It doesn't seem so in this case,
now, does it?

478
00:27:22,727 --> 00:27:25,195
So, Lieutenant...

479
00:27:25,229 --> 00:27:27,925
where exactly were you?

480
00:27:27,965 --> 00:27:29,432
Well, we--

481
00:27:29,467 --> 00:27:30,661
Thank you.

482
00:27:30,702 --> 00:27:33,364
Started up on him when
he pulled through the clouds...

483
00:27:33,404 --> 00:27:34,871
and then I moved above him.

484
00:27:34,906 --> 00:27:36,771
If you were directly
above him...

485
00:27:36,808 --> 00:27:38,139
how could you see him?

486
00:27:38,176 --> 00:27:40,701
Because I was inverted.

487
00:27:40,745 --> 00:27:42,212
Bullshit.

488
00:27:42,246 --> 00:27:44,305
GOOSE: No, he was, man.

489
00:27:44,349 --> 00:27:47,079
It was a really great move.
He was inverted.

490
00:27:47,118 --> 00:27:49,712
You were in a four ''G''...

491
00:27:49,754 --> 00:27:52,552
inverted dive with a MIG-28?

492
00:27:52,590 --> 00:27:54,217
Yes, ma'am.

493
00:27:54,258 --> 00:27:55,725
At what range?

494
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:57,625
Um, about two meters.

495
00:27:57,662 --> 00:27:59,994
It was actually
about one and a half.

496
00:28:00,031 --> 00:28:02,898
I've got a great Polaroid of it,
and he's right there.

497
00:28:02,934 --> 00:28:04,162
MAVERICK:
It was a nice picture.

498
00:28:04,202 --> 00:28:05,396
Uh, Lieutenant.

499
00:28:07,638 --> 00:28:10,163
What were you doing there?

500
00:28:10,208 --> 00:28:11,675
Communicating.

501
00:28:11,709 --> 00:28:13,176
Communicating.

502
00:28:13,211 --> 00:28:15,475
Keeping up foreign relations.

503
00:28:15,513 --> 00:28:16,741
That was it.

504
00:28:16,781 --> 00:28:18,146
Giving him the bird.

505
00:28:20,184 --> 00:28:21,344
You know, the finger.

506
00:28:21,386 --> 00:28:23,149
Yes, I know the finger, Goose.

507
00:28:23,187 --> 00:28:25,212
I'm Sorry.
I hate when it does that.

508
00:28:26,858 --> 00:28:28,018
Excuse me.

509
00:28:28,659 --> 00:28:30,786
So you're the one?

510
00:28:30,828 --> 00:28:32,489
Yes, ma'am.

511
00:28:32,530 --> 00:28:35,829
AII right, gentlemen,
we have a hop to take.

512
00:28:35,867 --> 00:28:38,700
The hard-deck on this hop
is 10,000 feet.

513
00:28:38,736 --> 00:28:40,704
There'll be no engagement
below that.

514
00:28:40,738 --> 00:28:42,330
Move it!

515
00:28:47,678 --> 00:28:48,667
Lieutenant.

516
00:28:50,081 --> 00:28:52,049
GOOSE: OK, well,
don't be late again.

517
00:28:52,083 --> 00:28:53,380
You look great, honey.

518
00:28:53,418 --> 00:28:55,818
MAVERICK: Thanks, dear.
See you in preflight.

519
00:28:55,853 --> 00:28:58,321
Lieutenant,
why didn't you tell me...

520
00:28:58,356 --> 00:29:00,324
that you were a famous
MIG insulter?

521
00:29:00,358 --> 00:29:01,950
Would it have made
any difference?

522
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:04,428
Not in the ladies' room, no.

523
00:29:04,462 --> 00:29:05,622
What would have?

524
00:29:06,364 --> 00:29:08,093
I'm an instructor
at this school.

525
00:29:08,132 --> 00:29:10,930
I see 20 new hotshots
every 8 weeks.

526
00:29:10,968 --> 00:29:12,959
Now, I'm sure
you can figure that out.

527
00:29:13,471 --> 00:29:14,631
Look, Lieutenant...

528
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:18,302
I'd just really like to hear
about the MIG sometime.

529
00:29:19,377 --> 00:29:21,470
You've got security clearance.

530
00:29:22,313 --> 00:29:23,803
You can read about it.

531
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:30,880
Maverick.

532
00:29:32,223 --> 00:29:34,214
I'm curious.

533
00:29:35,226 --> 00:29:38,627
Who was covering Cougar...

534
00:29:38,663 --> 00:29:41,689
while you were showboating
with this MIG?

535
00:29:41,732 --> 00:29:44,360
Cougar was doing just fine.

536
00:29:44,402 --> 00:29:45,869
Uh-huh.

537
00:29:45,937 --> 00:29:47,962
JESTER: Gentlemen,
this is your first hop.

538
00:29:48,005 --> 00:29:50,496
The jets you are flying against
are smaller, faster...

539
00:29:50,541 --> 00:29:51,913
and more maneuverable...

540
00:29:52,046 --> 00:29:53,172
just like the enemy MIGs.

541
00:29:53,214 --> 00:29:55,614
The clock is ticking,
and we're now keeping score.

542
00:29:57,185 --> 00:29:58,584
I lost him, Goose!

543
00:30:00,154 --> 00:30:01,712
Show me what you got, kid.

544
00:30:02,990 --> 00:30:04,048
I lost him !

545
00:30:04,091 --> 00:30:05,149
I'm looking!

546
00:30:07,962 --> 00:30:10,192
Got him ! He's on our tail!
Coming hard!

547
00:30:10,231 --> 00:30:12,256
Yeah, I got him. Here we go.

548
00:30:25,379 --> 00:30:26,710
Talk to me, Goose.

549
00:30:26,747 --> 00:30:28,874
He's still back there,
closing in on us.

550
00:30:28,916 --> 00:30:30,178
He's closing fast.

551
00:30:30,218 --> 00:30:32,311
You can run, kid,
but you can't hide.

552
00:30:36,791 --> 00:30:39,487
Jester, let's see if I can
give you a run for your money.

553
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:47,199
Watch the mountains!

554
00:30:57,879 --> 00:30:59,403
He's still back there.

555
00:30:59,447 --> 00:31:02,245
Come on, Mav,
do some of that pilot shit.

556
00:31:02,283 --> 00:31:03,375
Yeah, I got him.

557
00:31:13,594 --> 00:31:14,583
Bring it right.

558
00:31:16,330 --> 00:31:18,230
I've had about enough
of this shit.

559
00:31:20,234 --> 00:31:22,134
I'II hit the brakes.
He'll fly past.

560
00:31:22,169 --> 00:31:23,568
OK, you're mine.

561
00:31:26,107 --> 00:31:27,096
Whoo!

562
00:31:31,746 --> 00:31:33,236
Jesus Christ!

563
00:31:34,749 --> 00:31:36,216
Whoo!

564
00:31:36,250 --> 00:31:38,775
Let's see what
you got now, Jester!

565
00:31:38,819 --> 00:31:40,719
OK, man, let's turn and burn!

566
00:31:58,873 --> 00:32:00,898
He's going vertical. So am I.

567
00:32:00,942 --> 00:32:03,502
We're going ballistic!
Go get him !

568
00:32:12,153 --> 00:32:13,916
He's going
for the hard-deck.

569
00:32:13,955 --> 00:32:16,219
Let's nail him first, Mav!

570
00:32:16,257 --> 00:32:17,952
MAVERICK:
No way, Jester. You're mine.

571
00:32:34,809 --> 00:32:35,798
I got you now!

572
00:32:37,778 --> 00:32:39,177
Whoo!

573
00:32:39,213 --> 00:32:41,875
Jester's dead, whoo-hoo!

574
00:32:41,916 --> 00:32:44,384
Jester's dead, yee-haw!

575
00:32:45,853 --> 00:32:48,583
Get your butts
above the hard-deck...

576
00:32:48,623 --> 00:32:50,318
and return
to base immediately.

577
00:32:53,094 --> 00:32:55,119
Yes, sir.

578
00:33:00,901 --> 00:33:04,098
Tower, this is Ghost Rider
requesting a flyby.

579
00:33:04,805 --> 00:33:07,433
Negative, Ghost Rider.
The pattern is full.

580
00:33:07,475 --> 00:33:09,568
No, Mav,
this is not a good idea.

581
00:33:09,610 --> 00:33:13,068
Sorry, Goose,
but it's time to buzz the tower.

582
00:33:21,489 --> 00:33:23,457
[Sonic boom]

583
00:33:24,458 --> 00:33:26,790
Goddamn son of a bitch!

584
00:33:28,963 --> 00:33:30,726
GOOSE: Yee-haw!

585
00:33:30,765 --> 00:33:33,427
Ha ha! Great balls of fire!

586
00:33:35,917 --> 00:33:38,078
Yee-haw! Jester's dead!

587
00:33:38,119 --> 00:33:39,450
You won? That's bullshit.

588
00:33:39,487 --> 00:33:40,613
Didn't everybody?

589
00:33:40,655 --> 00:33:42,987
Hell, no, man.
We got our butts kicked.

590
00:33:43,024 --> 00:33:43,991
30 seconds.

591
00:33:44,025 --> 00:33:46,220
We went like this.
He went like that.

592
00:33:46,261 --> 00:33:48,229
I said to Hollywood,
''Where'd he go?''

593
00:33:48,263 --> 00:33:51,255
Hollywood said,
''Where'd who go?''

594
00:33:51,299 --> 00:33:53,961
He's laughing at us
right on the radio.

595
00:33:54,002 --> 00:33:56,596
It's me laughing, dickhead.
We won!

596
00:33:56,638 --> 00:33:57,832
AII right!

597
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:00,102
They won, too, man.

598
00:34:00,442 --> 00:34:02,034
ICEMAN:
That's not what I heard.

599
00:34:02,077 --> 00:34:04,409
GOOSE: We did. We got Jester.

600
00:34:04,446 --> 00:34:06,778
SLINGER: Below the hard-deck
does not count.

601
00:34:06,815 --> 00:34:09,648
Hard-deck, my ass.
We nailed that son of a bitch.

602
00:34:09,684 --> 00:34:11,345
ICEMAN:
You guys really are cowboys.

603
00:34:11,386 --> 00:34:12,717
MAVERICK:
What's your problem, Kazansky?

604
00:34:14,723 --> 00:34:16,190
You're everyone's problem.

605
00:34:16,224 --> 00:34:19,455
That's because every time you go
up in the air, you're unsafe.

606
00:34:19,494 --> 00:34:21,485
I don't like you
because you're dangerous.

607
00:34:21,529 --> 00:34:23,292
That's right...

608
00:34:23,331 --> 00:34:25,697
Ice...man.

609
00:34:25,734 --> 00:34:27,565
I am dangerous.

610
00:34:30,672 --> 00:34:33,698
Maverick, you and Goose get your
butts out of that flight gear...

611
00:34:33,742 --> 00:34:35,607
and up to Viper's office now.

612
00:34:39,247 --> 00:34:40,714
Remember, boys.

613
00:34:40,749 --> 00:34:43,115
No points for second place.

614
00:34:43,952 --> 00:34:45,214
You're a lot brighter
than you look.

615
00:34:45,253 --> 00:34:46,720
You shut up, OK?

616
00:34:46,755 --> 00:34:48,518
Don't worry, Goose.

617
00:34:48,556 --> 00:34:50,421
Two of your
snot-nosed jockeys...

618
00:34:50,458 --> 00:34:53,052
did a flyby on my tower
at over 400 knots!

619
00:34:53,094 --> 00:34:55,221
I want somebody's butt!
I want it now!

620
00:34:55,263 --> 00:34:57,231
I've had it!

621
00:34:57,265 --> 00:35:00,496
God damn it! That's twice!

622
00:35:00,535 --> 00:35:02,264
I want some butts!

623
00:35:03,905 --> 00:35:07,170
Well, that'll just about cover
the flybys.

624
00:35:07,208 --> 00:35:08,698
Follow me.

625
00:35:13,648 --> 00:35:15,206
Gentlemen...

626
00:35:16,718 --> 00:35:18,709
you had a hell of a first day.

627
00:35:21,956 --> 00:35:25,153
The hard-deck for this hop
was 10,000 feet.

628
00:35:25,627 --> 00:35:27,151
You knew it, you broke it.

629
00:35:28,029 --> 00:35:29,929
You followed
Commander Heatherly below...

630
00:35:29,964 --> 00:35:32,626
after he lost sight of you
and called ''no joy.''

631
00:35:34,235 --> 00:35:35,896
Why?

632
00:35:35,937 --> 00:35:37,529
Sir!

633
00:35:37,572 --> 00:35:40,302
I had Commander Heatherly
in my sights.

634
00:35:40,341 --> 00:35:42,434
He saw me move in for the kill.

635
00:35:42,477 --> 00:35:45,935
He then proceeded
below the hard-deck.

636
00:35:45,980 --> 00:35:49,438
We weren't below 10,000
for more than a few seconds.

637
00:35:49,484 --> 00:35:50,781
I had the shot....

638
00:35:50,819 --> 00:35:52,650
there was no danger,
so I took it.

639
00:35:54,489 --> 00:35:55,956
You took it...

640
00:35:55,990 --> 00:35:58,254
and broke a major rule
of engagement!

641
00:35:59,761 --> 00:36:02,924
Then you broke another one
with that circus stunt flyby.

642
00:36:06,034 --> 00:36:07,296
Lieutenant Mitchell...

643
00:36:07,335 --> 00:36:11,203
Top Gun rules exist for your
safety and that of your team.

644
00:36:11,239 --> 00:36:13,605
They are not flexible,
nor am I.

645
00:36:14,542 --> 00:36:16,510
Either obey them,
or you are history.

646
00:36:16,544 --> 00:36:17,841
Is that clear?

647
00:36:19,547 --> 00:36:20,980
Yes, sir!

648
00:36:29,557 --> 00:36:30,990
Dismissed.

649
00:36:36,731 --> 00:36:39,097
I really enjoyed that, Mav.
Thanks a lot.

650
00:36:39,133 --> 00:36:41,192
Holy shit!

651
00:36:41,236 --> 00:36:43,227
Ahh.

652
00:36:44,606 --> 00:36:47,473
Maybe I could learn
how to be a truck driver.

653
00:36:47,509 --> 00:36:50,342
You have the number
of that driving school on TV?

654
00:36:50,378 --> 00:36:51,845
Truck Master, I think it is.

655
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:53,211
I might need that.

656
00:36:53,248 --> 00:36:56,217
His fitness report says it all.

657
00:36:56,251 --> 00:36:57,718
He's a wild card.

658
00:36:57,752 --> 00:37:01,244
Flies by the seat of his pants.
Completely unpredictable.

659
00:37:02,090 --> 00:37:03,751
He got you, didn't he?

660
00:37:05,193 --> 00:37:06,785
Yeah.

661
00:37:06,828 --> 00:37:08,261
Maverick.

662
00:37:09,931 --> 00:37:11,831
I flew with his old man.

663
00:37:15,436 --> 00:37:17,404
Tell me one thing.

664
00:37:17,438 --> 00:37:20,407
If you had to go into battle,
would you want him with you?

665
00:37:20,441 --> 00:37:21,430
JESTER: I don't know.

666
00:37:22,477 --> 00:37:23,603
I just don't know.

667
00:37:36,291 --> 00:37:37,758
Still awake?

668
00:37:37,792 --> 00:37:39,692
Yeah.

669
00:37:42,096 --> 00:37:43,495
What's up?

670
00:37:43,531 --> 00:37:45,761
Can't sleep.

671
00:37:46,968 --> 00:37:49,937
When I first realized
we were going to Top Gun...

672
00:37:49,971 --> 00:37:52,337
all I could think about
was getting that trophy.

673
00:37:54,242 --> 00:37:55,834
I gotta be
straight with you, Mav.

674
00:37:58,112 --> 00:38:00,012
Right now,
I just hope we graduate.

675
00:38:02,216 --> 00:38:03,547
I've got a family
to think about.

676
00:38:03,585 --> 00:38:05,849
I can't afford to blow this.

677
00:38:09,190 --> 00:38:13,183
I guess that flyby
wasn't such a big hit, huh?

678
00:38:16,197 --> 00:38:19,462
Look, man,
I know it's tough for you.

679
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:21,127
They wouldn't let you
in the academy...

680
00:38:21,169 --> 00:38:22,830
'cause you're
Duke Mitchell's kid.

681
00:38:22,870 --> 00:38:25,668
You have to live
with that reputation.

682
00:38:25,707 --> 00:38:27,971
But it's like every time
we go up there...

683
00:38:28,009 --> 00:38:29,874
it's like you're flying
against a ghost.

684
00:38:32,213 --> 00:38:34,204
Makes me nervous.

685
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:41,514
You're the only family I've got.

686
00:38:41,556 --> 00:38:44,389
I'm not going to let you down,
I promise.

687
00:38:53,735 --> 00:38:55,396
Get out of here.

688
00:39:11,753 --> 00:39:15,519
A rolling reversal would work
well in that situation.

689
00:39:17,425 --> 00:39:18,892
If I reversed on a hard cross...

690
00:39:18,926 --> 00:39:20,985
I could immediately
go to guns on them.

691
00:39:21,029 --> 00:39:23,827
At that speed, it's too fast.

692
00:39:23,865 --> 00:39:26,299
It's a little bit
too aggressive.

693
00:39:26,334 --> 00:39:28,928
Too aggressive?

694
00:39:31,105 --> 00:39:32,902
Yeah, I guess
when I see something...

695
00:39:32,940 --> 00:39:34,464
I go right after it.

696
00:39:35,910 --> 00:39:37,673
You didn't tell me
who you were the other night.

697
00:39:37,712 --> 00:39:40,681
You didn't give me a chance,
did you?

698
00:39:40,715 --> 00:39:42,478
You deserved it.

699
00:39:42,517 --> 00:39:44,678
I know.

700
00:39:44,719 --> 00:39:48,678
But, uh, you were tempted...

701
00:39:48,723 --> 00:39:52,124
to ask me out for dinner.

702
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:54,185
-No.
-No?

703
00:39:54,228 --> 00:39:57,026
No. I don't date students.

704
00:40:06,641 --> 00:40:09,166
I can see
it's dangerous for you...

705
00:40:09,210 --> 00:40:11,337
but if the government
trusts me...

706
00:40:12,747 --> 00:40:14,715
maybe you could.

707
00:40:21,456 --> 00:40:24,254
It takes a lot more
than just fancy flying.

708
00:40:37,772 --> 00:40:40,605
Crash and burn, huh, Mav?

709
00:40:44,779 --> 00:40:46,269
Slider...

710
00:40:48,783 --> 00:40:50,273
you stink.

711
00:41:00,197 --> 00:41:01,391
Let's go!

712
00:41:01,432 --> 00:41:02,922
OK, Ice, yeah!

713
00:41:02,966 --> 00:41:06,299
KENNY LOGGINS SINGING:
I'd say it was the right time...

714
00:41:06,336 --> 00:41:08,395
to walk away.

715
00:41:09,740 --> 00:41:12,538
When dreaming
takes you nowhere...

716
00:41:12,576 --> 00:41:14,908
it's time to play.

717
00:41:16,747 --> 00:41:19,215
Bodies working overtime.

718
00:41:19,249 --> 00:41:20,580
Money don't matter.

719
00:41:20,617 --> 00:41:22,710
The clock keeps ticking.

720
00:41:22,753 --> 00:41:25,187
Someone's on your mind.

721
00:41:27,091 --> 00:41:31,187
Funny,
but it's always the same.

722
00:41:31,228 --> 00:41:35,358
Playin',
playin' with the boys.

723
00:41:37,935 --> 00:41:41,564
Stayin',
playin' with them boys.

724
00:41:44,775 --> 00:41:47,505
After chasing sunsets...

725
00:41:47,544 --> 00:41:50,741
one of life's simple joys...

726
00:41:50,781 --> 00:41:52,248
is the boys.

727
00:41:52,282 --> 00:41:53,840
I don't want to be the moth...

728
00:41:53,884 --> 00:41:55,784
around your fire.

729
00:41:58,789 --> 00:42:02,316
I don't want to be obsessed
by my desire.

730
00:42:05,729 --> 00:42:08,357
You play too rough.

731
00:42:08,398 --> 00:42:12,732
Playin',
playin' with the boys.

732
00:42:14,905 --> 00:42:17,032
I'II be stayin'...

733
00:42:17,074 --> 00:42:20,532
playin' with the boys.

734
00:42:20,577 --> 00:42:22,704
WOLFMAN: We won! We won!

735
00:42:22,746 --> 00:42:25,715
GOOSE: Come on, Mav.
Just one more game.

736
00:42:25,749 --> 00:42:27,580
That evens it.
We can take them.

737
00:42:27,618 --> 00:42:30,109
I've got some things
I gotta take care of.

738
00:42:30,154 --> 00:42:33,715
Just one more game.
Please? For me?

739
00:42:33,757 --> 00:42:36,851
-Sorry.
-You're sorry? Come on.

740
00:42:36,894 --> 00:42:38,156
WOLFMAN:
Mother Goose, you pussy!

741
00:43:10,727 --> 00:43:12,217
Damn it.

742
00:43:23,740 --> 00:43:25,332
CHARLIE: Lieutenant.

743
00:43:30,247 --> 00:43:31,714
MAVERICK: Uh...

744
00:43:31,748 --> 00:43:33,716
CHARLIE: What, no singing?

745
00:43:33,750 --> 00:43:37,151
Look, I'm...I'm, um...

746
00:43:37,187 --> 00:43:38,745
No apologies.

747
00:43:46,730 --> 00:43:48,220
If you don't mind...

748
00:43:48,265 --> 00:43:50,495
I'm gonna just take
a quick shower...

749
00:43:50,534 --> 00:43:52,092
while you're
finishing up here.

750
00:43:53,437 --> 00:43:56,736
Yeah. I do mind.

751
00:43:56,773 --> 00:43:58,434
I'm hungry.

752
00:44:01,778 --> 00:44:05,179
And then...
I thought about it.

753
00:44:05,215 --> 00:44:06,682
I thought...

754
00:44:06,717 --> 00:44:10,414
''You know, Charlie,
he's a smart guy.

755
00:44:10,454 --> 00:44:14,015
''Why don't you just tell him
why you've got him here?''

756
00:44:15,392 --> 00:44:16,586
Well?

757
00:44:17,894 --> 00:44:19,418
It's the MIG.

758
00:44:23,767 --> 00:44:25,530
The MIG.

759
00:44:25,569 --> 00:44:28,367
You're the only pilot
who's been up against a MIG-28.

760
00:44:31,775 --> 00:44:33,299
I'm trying for
this big promotion at work...

761
00:44:33,343 --> 00:44:35,573
and if I get it,
I won't be here much longer.

762
00:44:37,347 --> 00:44:39,781
Seems to me
you've got it all figured out.

763
00:44:39,816 --> 00:44:41,408
Yeah.

764
00:44:43,420 --> 00:44:46,116
Except you did forget the wine.

765
00:44:46,156 --> 00:44:47,316
Oh.

766
00:44:48,759 --> 00:44:49,748
Sorry.

767
00:44:51,595 --> 00:44:53,222
You always get what you want?

768
00:44:53,263 --> 00:44:55,231
No, not always.

769
00:44:55,265 --> 00:44:57,165
Yeah, maybe.

770
00:44:57,200 --> 00:44:59,259
Then relax about the MIG.

771
00:45:12,616 --> 00:45:14,846
OTIS REDDING ON STEREO:
Sittin' in the mornin' sun...

772
00:45:14,885 --> 00:45:16,512
MAVERICK: This music.

773
00:45:16,553 --> 00:45:18,521
I'II be sittin'
when the evenin'...

774
00:45:18,555 --> 00:45:20,045
CHARLIE: An old friend?

775
00:45:22,225 --> 00:45:24,193
My folks loved it.

776
00:45:24,227 --> 00:45:26,252
I haven't heard this in years.

777
00:45:28,165 --> 00:45:31,191
My mother used to call down
from her room...

778
00:45:31,234 --> 00:45:33,702
and have me play this
over and over again.

779
00:45:33,737 --> 00:45:36,228
I got so sick of it.

780
00:45:38,241 --> 00:45:39,708
But not her.

781
00:45:39,743 --> 00:45:42,211
She'd just sit up there alone...

782
00:45:42,245 --> 00:45:43,735
just listening for hours.

783
00:45:45,082 --> 00:45:46,572
Just listening.

784
00:45:48,752 --> 00:45:50,743
She died shortly after him.

785
00:45:52,089 --> 00:45:54,250
What happened to your father?

786
00:45:58,862 --> 00:46:03,162
I guess I kind of figured
with your security clearance...

787
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:05,725
you'd know more about him
than I do.

788
00:46:06,870 --> 00:46:09,338
Well, I didn't get that far.

789
00:46:09,373 --> 00:46:10,533
Oh.

790
00:46:12,542 --> 00:46:14,533
Well, it's a big mystery.

791
00:46:16,046 --> 00:46:20,608
He disappeared in an F-4
November 5, 1965.

792
00:46:23,220 --> 00:46:27,213
The stink of it was...
he screwed up.

793
00:46:28,558 --> 00:46:30,924
No way.

794
00:46:30,961 --> 00:46:33,054
My old man was
a great fighter pilot.

795
00:46:37,067 --> 00:46:40,559
But who the hell knows?
It's all classified.

796
00:46:43,140 --> 00:46:44,971
Somebody must know.

797
00:46:45,008 --> 00:46:47,841
Yeah, somebody knows everything.

798
00:46:47,878 --> 00:46:50,847
Is that why you're always
second-best up there?

799
00:46:52,849 --> 00:46:54,840
You are direct, aren't you?

800
00:47:03,527 --> 00:47:05,518
I'm sorry I was late.

801
00:47:07,697 --> 00:47:10,461
I'm sorry for being direct.

802
00:47:10,500 --> 00:47:11,967
No apologies.

803
00:47:14,271 --> 00:47:16,762
This is going to be complicated.

804
00:47:28,852 --> 00:47:30,342
Where are you going?

805
00:47:31,455 --> 00:47:33,855
I'm going to take a shower.

806
00:47:37,894 --> 00:47:41,386
Thank you.
I enjoyed being here.

807
00:47:46,937 --> 00:47:48,928
[Motorcycle starts]

808
00:48:20,036 --> 00:48:22,937
It looks like you need
another shower.

809
00:48:25,208 --> 00:48:26,368
Right.

810
00:48:32,549 --> 00:48:34,540
I'm going to be honest with you.

811
00:48:36,353 --> 00:48:38,651
Your MIG sighting is
really important to my work...

812
00:48:38,688 --> 00:48:40,713
but, um...

813
00:48:45,228 --> 00:48:48,356
I don't normally invite students
to my house.

814
00:48:49,399 --> 00:48:50,798
You're, uh...

815
00:48:58,708 --> 00:49:01,233
But please understand,
I still have a job to do.

816
00:49:03,513 --> 00:49:05,674
-Morning.
-Sir.

817
00:49:28,204 --> 00:49:30,695
I'm glad we got that straight.

818
00:49:49,392 --> 00:49:51,622
I told her
how tough it is here--

819
00:49:51,661 --> 00:49:54,528
my ass dragging
like an old tired dog.

820
00:49:54,564 --> 00:49:57,465
I told her that you didn't
even have a woman here.

821
00:49:57,500 --> 00:49:58,967
You know what she said?

822
00:49:59,002 --> 00:50:01,994
''He probably doesn't have one.
He's got eight.''

823
00:50:10,780 --> 00:50:11,940
BOY: Daddy!

824
00:50:17,887 --> 00:50:22,824
CAROLE: So, you're in love
with one of your instructors.

825
00:50:22,859 --> 00:50:24,326
MAVERICK: Is that right?

826
00:50:24,361 --> 00:50:27,330
-I didn't tell her that.
-Yes, you did.

827
00:50:27,364 --> 00:50:30,822
I can't believe you said that!
That was a secret.

828
00:50:36,873 --> 00:50:38,807
VIPER: The bogey has
good position right here.

829
00:50:38,842 --> 00:50:40,057
AII right, freeze frame.

830
00:50:40,057 --> 00:50:40,489
AII right, freeze frame.

831
00:50:40,524 --> 00:50:42,424
Moment of choice.

832
00:50:42,459 --> 00:50:44,427
The F-14 is defensive.

833
00:50:44,461 --> 00:50:46,952
He has a chance to bug out
right here.

834
00:50:46,997 --> 00:50:50,728
Better to retire
and save your aircraft...

835
00:50:50,767 --> 00:50:52,894
than push a bad position.

836
00:50:52,936 --> 00:50:54,995
Charlie, jump in here anytime.

837
00:50:55,038 --> 00:50:58,007
You stay in that diamond
another three seconds...

838
00:50:58,041 --> 00:51:01,135
the bogey's gonna blow you
out of the sky.

839
00:51:01,178 --> 00:51:04,170
You take a hard right,
select zone five...

840
00:51:04,214 --> 00:51:06,682
you can extend an escape.

841
00:51:06,717 --> 00:51:08,776
You made a bad choice.

842
00:51:10,387 --> 00:51:11,581
Charlie.

843
00:51:14,057 --> 00:51:16,787
Aircraft one
performs a split ''S''?

844
00:51:16,827 --> 00:51:19,295
That's the last thing
you should do.

845
00:51:19,329 --> 00:51:22,696
The MIG's right on your tail.
Freeze there, please.

846
00:51:22,733 --> 00:51:25,133
The MIG has you
in his gun sight.

847
00:51:25,168 --> 00:51:27,500
What were you thinking
at this point?

848
00:51:27,537 --> 00:51:29,334
MAVERICK:
You don't have time to think.

849
00:51:29,373 --> 00:51:32,809
If you think, you're dead.

850
00:51:32,843 --> 00:51:36,335
That's a big gamble with
a $30 million plane, Lieutenant.

851
00:51:43,587 --> 00:51:45,714
Unfortunately,
the gamble worked.

852
00:51:45,756 --> 00:51:47,690
The MIG never got a clean shot.

853
00:51:48,892 --> 00:51:51,827
Maverick makes an aggressive
vertical move here.

854
00:51:51,862 --> 00:51:53,159
Comes over the top...

855
00:51:53,196 --> 00:51:56,165
and he defeats the bandit
with a missile shot.

856
00:51:56,199 --> 00:51:57,894
The encounter was a victory...

857
00:51:57,934 --> 00:52:01,802
but I think that we've shown it
as an example of what not to do.

858
00:52:03,373 --> 00:52:04,465
Next.

859
00:52:05,709 --> 00:52:08,200
Gutsiest move I ever saw, man.

860
00:52:11,715 --> 00:52:16,550
Now, this is a perfect example
of a textbook maneuver.

861
00:52:29,232 --> 00:52:30,392
Lieutenant.

862
00:52:35,072 --> 00:52:36,232
Maverick.

863
00:52:38,842 --> 00:52:40,002
Lieutenant!

864
00:52:41,745 --> 00:52:42,871
Lieutenant!

865
00:52:42,913 --> 00:52:45,381
My review
of your flight performance...

866
00:52:45,415 --> 00:52:48,213
was right on,
in my professional opinion--

867
00:52:48,251 --> 00:52:50,310
I can't hear you.

868
00:53:11,208 --> 00:53:14,109
MAVERICK: Jesus Christ!
And you think I'm reckless!

869
00:53:14,144 --> 00:53:15,839
When I fly,
I'II have you know...

870
00:53:15,879 --> 00:53:18,177
that my crew
and my plane come first!

871
00:53:18,215 --> 00:53:20,342
CHARLIE: I'm going to finish
my sentence, Lieutenant!

872
00:53:20,383 --> 00:53:23,011
My review of your flight
performance was right on!

873
00:53:23,053 --> 00:53:24,179
Is that right?

874
00:53:24,221 --> 00:53:26,621
That is right.
But I held something back.

875
00:53:26,656 --> 00:53:28,624
I see real genius
in your flying...

876
00:53:28,658 --> 00:53:30,592
but I can't say that in there.

877
00:53:30,627 --> 00:53:33,926
I was afraid that everyone
would see right through me.

878
00:53:33,964 --> 00:53:37,957
And I just don't want anyone
to know I've fallen for you.

879
00:54:05,729 --> 00:54:07,924
BERLIN PERFORMING:
Watchin' every motion...

880
00:54:07,964 --> 00:54:11,764
in this foolish lovers' game.

881
00:54:15,705 --> 00:54:17,900
Haunted by the notion...

882
00:54:17,941 --> 00:54:22,901
somewhere there's a love
in flames.

883
00:54:25,749 --> 00:54:27,910
Turning and returning...

884
00:54:27,951 --> 00:54:33,548
to some secret place inside.

885
00:54:35,759 --> 00:54:38,227
Watching in slow motion...

886
00:54:38,261 --> 00:54:42,664
as you turn my way...

887
00:54:42,699 --> 00:54:44,428
and say...

888
00:54:44,467 --> 00:54:48,426
''Take my breath away...''

889
00:54:52,509 --> 00:54:54,568
''my love.''

890
00:54:54,611 --> 00:54:58,547
''Take my breath away...''

891
00:55:02,352 --> 00:55:04,547
''my love.''

892
00:55:04,588 --> 00:55:11,118
''Take my breath away,
my love.''

893
00:55:24,105 --> 00:55:25,902
-Hey, Maverick.
-Yeah.

894
00:55:25,940 --> 00:55:28,909
-You hear about Ice?
-What's that?

895
00:55:28,943 --> 00:55:30,410
He won another one.

896
00:55:30,445 --> 00:55:32,970
-Really?
-Yeah.

897
00:55:33,014 --> 00:55:35,039
MAVERICK: I feel the need.

898
00:55:35,083 --> 00:55:37,677
BOTH: The need for speed.

899
00:55:41,923 --> 00:55:43,891
JESTER:
Gentlemen, this is hop 19.

900
00:55:43,925 --> 00:55:45,893
Multiple aircraft,
multiple bogeys.

901
00:55:45,927 --> 00:55:47,895
Your training is half over.

902
00:55:47,929 --> 00:55:50,762
The competition for the Top Gun
trophy remains tight.

903
00:55:50,798 --> 00:55:52,390
First place--Iceman.

904
00:55:52,433 --> 00:55:56,233
Second place--Maverick.
Just two points behind.

905
00:55:56,271 --> 00:55:57,568
There they are.

906
00:55:57,605 --> 00:56:00,005
Three miles, left, 10 o'clock.
I don't think they see us yet.

907
00:56:00,041 --> 00:56:02,009
OK, I see them.

908
00:56:02,043 --> 00:56:05,274
Two A-4s, left, 10 o'clock.
Continue left turn.

909
00:56:13,922 --> 00:56:16,652
Good morning, gentlemen.
The temperature's 110 degrees.

910
00:56:16,691 --> 00:56:18,283
Holy shit! It's Viper!

911
00:56:18,326 --> 00:56:20,294
Viper's up here. Great!

912
00:56:20,328 --> 00:56:22,125
Oh, shit.

913
00:56:22,163 --> 00:56:23,790
Great. He's probably saying...

914
00:56:23,831 --> 00:56:25,662
''Holy shit,
it's Maverick and Goose.''

915
00:56:25,700 --> 00:56:27,292
Yeah, sure he's saying that.

916
00:56:30,705 --> 00:56:32,764
I've got my eye
on the northern bogey.

917
00:56:32,807 --> 00:56:34,604
Roger. I got the southern guy.

918
00:56:37,178 --> 00:56:38,702
Hollywood, you lead.
I'II cover you.

919
00:56:51,893 --> 00:56:53,155
Break now, Jester.

920
00:56:58,199 --> 00:57:00,394
Hollywood, we're losing Viper.
Let's stay on Jester.

921
00:57:00,435 --> 00:57:01,561
Roger. I'm on him.

922
00:57:05,840 --> 00:57:08,741
Goose, find Viper.
He's out there somewhere.

923
00:57:08,776 --> 00:57:11,643
Stay with Hollywood, Mav.
We're covering his wing.

924
00:57:13,414 --> 00:57:14,847
Goose! There's Viper.

925
00:57:14,882 --> 00:57:16,281
Three o'clock low.

926
00:57:16,317 --> 00:57:18,342
Stay with Hollywood.
We're his cover.

927
00:57:18,386 --> 00:57:19,876
Don't you leave me, Maverick.

928
00:57:19,921 --> 00:57:23,880
Hollywood, you're looking good.
I'm going after Viper.

929
00:57:27,328 --> 00:57:28,989
Goddamn you, Maverick!

930
00:57:29,030 --> 00:57:30,554
Mav, don't leave him.

931
00:57:30,598 --> 00:57:33,396
Goose, Hollywood's OK.
I want Viper.

932
00:57:36,938 --> 00:57:38,872
Stand by. Viper's coming down.

933
00:57:45,947 --> 00:57:47,414
Holy shit, we're head-to-head.

934
00:57:47,448 --> 00:57:49,678
I can't believe
we're doing this.

935
00:58:03,531 --> 00:58:05,123
Whoo! Rock and roll!

936
00:58:05,166 --> 00:58:07,157
Here's our chance!
It's a big one, Goose!

937
00:58:09,570 --> 00:58:10,901
Come on, goddamn it!

938
00:58:14,909 --> 00:58:16,137
Come on, Mav, keep coming!

939
00:58:20,815 --> 00:58:22,715
OK, Sidewinder missile selected.

940
00:58:22,750 --> 00:58:24,843
Come on, baby. Come on.

941
00:58:24,886 --> 00:58:27,821
Come around, come around.
That's it, that's it.

942
00:58:33,594 --> 00:58:34,788
Jesus, this guy's good!

943
00:58:34,829 --> 00:58:36,888
Goose! Where's he going?

944
00:58:36,931 --> 00:58:38,398
Come on! Come on!

945
00:58:38,433 --> 00:58:39,923
Keep coming, keep coming!

946
00:58:44,105 --> 00:58:45,094
Come on, baby.

947
00:58:50,845 --> 00:58:52,312
Damn, this kid's good.

948
00:58:53,948 --> 00:58:55,609
He's too close
for missiles, Goose.

949
00:58:55,650 --> 00:58:57,140
I'm switching to guns.

950
00:58:59,754 --> 00:59:00,982
Come on! Come on!

951
00:59:03,925 --> 00:59:06,450
Stick with it.
Stick with it.

952
00:59:09,797 --> 00:59:12,493
Hold it! Goose, check our tail!

953
00:59:12,533 --> 00:59:14,091
Shit! There's Jester!

954
00:59:14,135 --> 00:59:16,831
Bingo, Maverick's dead.
You're out of there, kid.

955
00:59:16,871 --> 00:59:17,997
Shit!

956
00:59:18,039 --> 00:59:20,803
Defense Department
regrets to inform you...

957
00:59:20,842 --> 00:59:23,333
that your sons are dead
because they were stupid.

958
00:59:23,377 --> 00:59:26,540
Great balls of fire!

959
00:59:26,581 --> 00:59:28,606
OK, knock it off, gentlemen.

960
00:59:28,649 --> 00:59:30,776
Let's go home.
Viper has the lead.

961
00:59:35,978 --> 00:59:39,243
30 seconds, Wolfman,
I'm coming in.

962
00:59:39,282 --> 00:59:40,510
Shut up!

963
00:59:40,550 --> 00:59:42,347
Butt nose.

964
00:59:42,385 --> 00:59:44,751
JESTER: That was some of
the best flying I've ever seen.

965
00:59:44,787 --> 00:59:47,187
Right up to the part
where you got killed.

966
00:59:47,223 --> 00:59:49,691
You never,
never leave your wingman.

967
00:59:57,133 --> 00:59:58,293
Maverick...

968
01:00:00,403 --> 01:00:03,372
it's not your flying.
It's your attitude.

969
01:00:03,406 --> 01:00:06,000
The enemy's dangerous...

970
01:00:06,042 --> 01:00:09,205
but right now,
you're worse than the enemy.

971
01:00:09,245 --> 01:00:12,112
You're dangerous and foolish.

972
01:00:12,148 --> 01:00:16,084
You may not like your wingmen,
they may not like you...

973
01:00:16,119 --> 01:00:17,746
but whose side are you on?

974
01:00:26,863 --> 01:00:30,560
GOOSE: At least Viper
got Iceman before he got us.

975
01:00:30,600 --> 01:00:32,431
We still got a shot at it.

976
01:00:33,069 --> 01:00:37,028
MAVERICK: That was stupid.
I know better than that.

977
01:00:37,073 --> 01:00:39,564
That will never happen again.

978
01:00:42,445 --> 01:00:43,844
I know.

979
01:00:49,352 --> 01:00:50,717
I know.

980
01:01:28,724 --> 01:01:31,955
[Singing] You shake my nerves,
and you rattle my brain.

981
01:01:31,994 --> 01:01:34,861
Thinkin' 'bout your love
drives a man insane.

982
01:01:34,897 --> 01:01:36,524
You break my wiII.

983
01:01:36,566 --> 01:01:37,794
Oh, what a thrill.

984
01:01:37,833 --> 01:01:40,893
Goodness, gracious,
great balls of fire.

985
01:01:40,937 --> 01:01:45,203
CAROLE: Would you go fetch him?
Doesn't he ever embarrass you?

986
01:01:45,241 --> 01:01:48,210
MAVERICK: Hell, no.
Well, there was the time--

987
01:01:48,244 --> 01:01:51,873
-Admiral's daughter.
-What?!

988
01:01:51,914 --> 01:01:54,314
He told me all about the time...

989
01:01:54,350 --> 01:01:56,318
you went ballistic
with Penny Benjamin.

990
01:01:57,320 --> 01:01:59,254
MAVERICK:
Did he? Well, that's great.

991
01:01:59,288 --> 01:02:01,984
CAROLE: He tells me
about all of them, Maverick.

992
01:02:02,024 --> 01:02:06,085
How my Iittle angel, Goose,
goes home early for church...

993
01:02:06,128 --> 01:02:08,995
and you, you always go home
with the hot women.

994
01:02:09,031 --> 01:02:10,362
MAVERICK:
AII right, thank you, Carole.

995
01:02:10,399 --> 01:02:13,459
I'm gonna go embarrass myself
with Goose for a while.

996
01:02:16,005 --> 01:02:17,768
Whoo! Whoo hoo!

997
01:02:17,807 --> 01:02:19,172
Ow!

998
01:02:19,208 --> 01:02:22,336
BOTH: You shake my nerves,
and you rattle my brain.

999
01:02:22,378 --> 01:02:25,347
Thinkin' 'bout your love
drives a man insane.

1000
01:02:25,381 --> 01:02:26,712
You broke my will.

1001
01:02:26,749 --> 01:02:28,114
Oh, what a thrill.

1002
01:02:28,150 --> 01:02:31,176
Goodness, gracious,
great balls of fire.

1003
01:02:31,220 --> 01:02:34,656
CAROLE: I'd love to be able to
warn you off about Maverick...

1004
01:02:34,690 --> 01:02:37,318
but I just love him to death.

1005
01:02:37,360 --> 01:02:40,659
I've known Pete
for a lot of years now...

1006
01:02:40,696 --> 01:02:43,688
and I'm telling you
one thing's for certain...

1007
01:02:43,733 --> 01:02:47,999
there are hearts breaking open
all over the world tonight.

1008
01:02:48,037 --> 01:02:49,061
Why?

1009
01:02:49,105 --> 01:02:53,667
Because unless you are a fool,
that boy is off the market.

1010
01:02:53,709 --> 01:02:58,237
in love with you.

1011
01:02:59,348 --> 01:03:01,839
Hey, Goose, you big stud!

1012
01:03:01,884 --> 01:03:03,010
That's me, honey.

1013
01:03:03,052 --> 01:03:05,179
Take me to bed
or lose me forever!

1014
01:03:05,221 --> 01:03:06,950
Show me the way home.

1015
01:03:09,091 --> 01:03:11,082
Come on.
Sing with the family.

1016
01:03:12,461 --> 01:03:13,587
A-ha!

1017
01:03:13,629 --> 01:03:14,994
A-ha!

1018
01:03:15,031 --> 01:03:17,727
[Singing] You shake my nerves,
and you rattle my brain.

1019
01:03:17,767 --> 01:03:20,759
Thinkin' 'bout your love
drives a man insane.

1020
01:03:20,803 --> 01:03:22,236
You broke my will.

1021
01:03:22,271 --> 01:03:23,795
Oh, what a thrill.

1022
01:03:23,839 --> 01:03:26,774
Goodness, gracious,
great balls of fire.

1023
01:03:26,809 --> 01:03:27,969
Yee-haw!

1024
01:03:28,010 --> 01:03:28,999
Ow!

1025
01:03:43,693 --> 01:03:45,126
Maverick...

1026
01:03:46,829 --> 01:03:48,490
you big stud.

1027
01:03:48,531 --> 01:03:51,591
Take me to bed
or lose me forever.

1028
01:04:05,373 --> 01:04:07,603
JESTER: OK, gentlemen,
this is hop 31.

1029
01:04:07,642 --> 01:04:09,132
Two weeks to graduation.

1030
01:04:09,177 --> 01:04:11,270
Top Gun trophy's
still up for grabs...

1031
01:04:11,313 --> 01:04:12,610
so every point counts.

1032
01:04:30,732 --> 01:04:32,359
KENNY LOGGINS SINGING:
Revvin' up your engine.

1033
01:04:32,400 --> 01:04:34,994
Listen to her howl and roar.

1034
01:04:36,905 --> 01:04:38,429
Metal under tension...

1035
01:04:38,473 --> 01:04:41,203
beggin' you to touch and go.

1036
01:04:43,211 --> 01:04:47,807
Highway to the danger zone.

1037
01:04:49,317 --> 01:04:55,847
Ride into the danger zone.

1038
01:04:55,890 --> 01:04:58,188
It's bottom of the ninth.
The score is tied.

1039
01:04:58,226 --> 01:04:59,693
It's time for the big one.

1040
01:04:59,728 --> 01:05:01,195
You up for this one, Maverick?

1041
01:05:01,229 --> 01:05:03,697
Just a walk in the park,
Kazansky.

1042
01:05:07,669 --> 01:05:10,194
Contact.
Multiple bogeys. 1-6-5.

1043
01:05:10,238 --> 01:05:12,570
Two miles. Looks like
they're going away from us.

1044
01:05:12,607 --> 01:05:14,040
Ho, I see them.

1045
01:05:14,075 --> 01:05:15,667
Tallyho.
Right, two o'clock. I'm in.

1046
01:05:15,710 --> 01:05:16,734
I'm in.

1047
01:05:36,664 --> 01:05:38,996
That son of a bitch
cut me off.

1048
01:05:47,175 --> 01:05:49,666
Come on, come on. Jesus Christ.

1049
01:05:49,711 --> 01:05:51,406
Ice, take the shot.

1050
01:05:51,446 --> 01:05:53,346
Ice, get the hell out of there.

1051
01:05:53,381 --> 01:05:54,678
I can't get the angle.

1052
01:05:54,716 --> 01:05:57,378
I'm too close for missiles.
I'm switching to guns.

1053
01:05:57,419 --> 01:05:59,046
Ice, fire or clear.

1054
01:06:04,993 --> 01:06:06,460
Look at this.

1055
01:06:06,494 --> 01:06:09,190
Jesus Christ, I could take
the shot right here!

1056
01:06:09,230 --> 01:06:11,323
I need another 20 seconds,
then I've got him.

1057
01:06:16,971 --> 01:06:18,768
I'm moving in.
I've got the shot.

1058
01:06:18,807 --> 01:06:20,331
Mav, let's get in there.

1059
01:06:20,375 --> 01:06:21,364
Come on, Mav.

1060
01:06:22,844 --> 01:06:25,005
Maverick's getting impatient.
Come on, take the shot.

1061
01:06:25,046 --> 01:06:26,673
Ten more seconds,
then I've got him.

1062
01:06:28,550 --> 01:06:31,542
Ice, get out of there.
Let's do it, Mav.

1063
01:06:31,586 --> 01:06:33,451
Ice, come off high right.
I'm in.

1064
01:06:33,488 --> 01:06:34,614
Five more seconds.

1065
01:06:34,656 --> 01:06:36,749
Come off high right, Ice.
I'm in.

1066
01:06:36,791 --> 01:06:38,122
I'm off him. Shit!

1067
01:06:41,529 --> 01:06:43,292
We're in his jetwash.

1068
01:06:43,331 --> 01:06:44,389
Holy shit!

1069
01:06:47,402 --> 01:06:50,269
GOOSE: This is not good.
We got a flame out back.

1070
01:06:50,305 --> 01:06:51,738
Engine one is out.

1071
01:06:51,773 --> 01:06:53,331
Engine two is out.

1072
01:06:53,374 --> 01:06:55,604
Goose, I'm losing control,
I'm losing control!

1073
01:06:55,643 --> 01:06:58,168
I can't control it.
It won't recover. Shit!

1074
01:07:00,615 --> 01:07:02,480
It's coupling up.
We're out of control.

1075
01:07:02,517 --> 01:07:04,644
This is not good.

1076
01:07:04,686 --> 01:07:06,517
ICEMAN: Mayday! Mayday!
Mav's in trouble.

1077
01:07:06,554 --> 01:07:08,715
He's in a flat spin,
heading out to sea.

1078
01:07:11,159 --> 01:07:14,560
Altitude 8,000! 7,000!

1079
01:07:15,763 --> 01:07:17,788
Six. We're at six, Mav.

1080
01:07:17,832 --> 01:07:18,821
Aah!

1081
01:07:20,435 --> 01:07:21,925
I'm pinned forward, Goose.

1082
01:07:21,970 --> 01:07:23,528
I can't reach
the ejection handle.

1083
01:07:25,306 --> 01:07:27,274
Goose, you have to punch us out.

1084
01:07:27,308 --> 01:07:29,367
I can't reach
the ejection handle.

1085
01:07:29,410 --> 01:07:30,502
Eject!

1086
01:07:30,545 --> 01:07:31,512
I'm trying.

1087
01:07:31,546 --> 01:07:33,173
Eject! Eject! Eject!

1088
01:07:33,214 --> 01:07:34,909
Watch the canopy.

1089
01:07:52,400 --> 01:07:54,027
Goose! Goose!

1090
01:07:54,068 --> 01:07:55,092
Oh, no.

1091
01:07:55,136 --> 01:07:56,228
Oh.

1092
01:07:58,139 --> 01:07:59,265
Oh, God.

1093
01:07:59,307 --> 01:08:01,241
Oh, God. Oh, God.

1094
01:08:01,276 --> 01:08:02,300
Oh.

1095
01:08:15,123 --> 01:08:17,216
Oh, God. Oh, God.

1096
01:08:47,422 --> 01:08:50,619
DIVER: Sir, let go of him.

1097
01:08:50,658 --> 01:08:52,285
You got to let him go, sir.

1098
01:09:35,460 --> 01:09:37,121
VIPER: How you doing?

1099
01:09:37,162 --> 01:09:38,720
MAVERICK: I'm all right.

1100
01:09:41,566 --> 01:09:43,033
VIPER: Goose is dead.

1101
01:09:43,068 --> 01:09:44,626
I know.

1102
01:09:48,139 --> 01:09:52,200
VIPER: You fly jets long enough
something like this happens.

1103
01:09:53,344 --> 01:09:56,802
He was my R.I.O.
My responsibility.

1104
01:09:59,818 --> 01:10:02,946
My squadron in Vietnam,
we lost 8 of 18 aircraft.

1105
01:10:02,987 --> 01:10:04,511
Ten men.

1106
01:10:04,556 --> 01:10:07,992
First one dies, you die, too.

1107
01:10:08,993 --> 01:10:11,223
But there will be others.

1108
01:10:12,230 --> 01:10:14,164
You can count on it.

1109
01:10:16,334 --> 01:10:18,666
You got to let him go.

1110
01:10:20,805 --> 01:10:23,273
You got to let him go.

1111
01:10:40,959 --> 01:10:42,722
MAVERICK:
I think maybe it was my fault.

1112
01:10:45,196 --> 01:10:46,686
I don't know.

1113
01:10:48,199 --> 01:10:51,259
I don't know
what the hell went wrong.

1114
01:10:53,204 --> 01:10:55,468
I'd like to help.

1115
01:10:56,708 --> 01:10:58,369
I know it's difficult.

1116
01:11:03,081 --> 01:11:05,379
God, I want him back.

1117
01:11:12,023 --> 01:11:15,083
I'II be here if you need me, OK?

1118
01:13:08,106 --> 01:13:10,768
God, he loved flying with you,
Maverick.

1119
01:13:28,993 --> 01:13:32,929
He'd have flown anyway...
without you.

1120
01:13:34,666 --> 01:13:38,762
He'd have hated it,
but he would have done it.

1121
01:13:59,190 --> 01:14:01,590
INQUIRY COMMANDER: We find that
the F-14 flat spin...

1122
01:14:01,626 --> 01:14:04,595
was induced
by the disruption of airflow...

1123
01:14:04,629 --> 01:14:06,096
into the starboard engine.

1124
01:14:06,130 --> 01:14:10,760
This disruption
stalled the engine...

1125
01:14:10,802 --> 01:14:13,600
which produced
enough yaw rate...

1126
01:14:13,638 --> 01:14:18,098
to induce a spin
which was unrecoverable.

1127
01:14:18,142 --> 01:14:19,609
There was no way...

1128
01:14:19,644 --> 01:14:21,111
Lieutenant Mitchell
could either see or avoid...

1129
01:14:21,145 --> 01:14:23,841
the jetwash
which produced the engine stall.

1130
01:14:23,881 --> 01:14:27,544
Therefore, the board finds
Lieutenant Pete Mitchell...

1131
01:14:27,585 --> 01:14:29,883
was not at fault
in the accident of 29 July.

1132
01:14:29,921 --> 01:14:32,185
Lieutenant Mitchell's record
is cleared of this incident.

1133
01:14:32,223 --> 01:14:36,159
Lieutenant Mitchell is restored
to flight status without delay.

1134
01:14:38,062 --> 01:14:39,689
These proceedings are closed.

1135
01:14:48,239 --> 01:14:50,867
Get him up flying soon.

1136
01:15:17,735 --> 01:15:19,828
JESTER: Come on, kid.
Get in there. Engage.

1137
01:15:19,871 --> 01:15:21,736
SUNDOWN: You got a bogey
at two o'cIock low.

1138
01:15:21,773 --> 01:15:23,741
You got the angle.
Piece of cake.

1139
01:15:27,979 --> 01:15:30,072
JESTER: Take the shot, kid.

1140
01:15:31,883 --> 01:15:33,009
SUNDOWN:
You can engage any time.

1141
01:15:43,861 --> 01:15:46,386
Hey, where the hell
are you going?

1142
01:15:46,431 --> 01:15:48,831
Uh, it's not good.
It doesn't look good.

1143
01:15:48,866 --> 01:15:52,063
It doesn't get to look
any better than that.

1144
01:16:04,682 --> 01:16:07,242
SUNDOWN: Hey, man,
we couId have had him.

1145
01:16:07,285 --> 01:16:09,344
Hey, we could have had him, man!

1146
01:16:10,955 --> 01:16:14,186
I will fire when I am
goddamn good and ready!

1147
01:16:14,225 --> 01:16:15,692
You got that?

1148
01:16:34,178 --> 01:16:36,612
JESTER: He can't get back
in the saddle. Won't engage.

1149
01:16:36,647 --> 01:16:38,945
VIPER:
It's only been a few days.

1150
01:16:38,983 --> 01:16:42,475
JESTER: You know,
he just might not make it back.

1151
01:16:45,690 --> 01:16:47,157
Keep sending him up.

1152
01:17:06,055 --> 01:17:07,545
Mitchell...

1153
01:17:09,058 --> 01:17:10,685
I'm sorry about Goose.

1154
01:17:15,064 --> 01:17:16,554
Everybody liked him.

1155
01:17:22,572 --> 01:17:24,062
I'm sorry.

1156
01:17:43,793 --> 01:17:45,590
Hi, it's Wolfman.

1157
01:17:48,598 --> 01:17:50,259
Yeah, Maverick just quit.

1158
01:18:13,389 --> 01:18:14,515
Excuse me.

1159
01:18:18,060 --> 01:18:19,527
May I?

1160
01:18:19,562 --> 01:18:20,995
Please.

1161
01:18:30,206 --> 01:18:32,538
CHARLIE:
I'II have what he's having.

1162
01:18:32,575 --> 01:18:34,406
Hemlock, is it?

1163
01:18:35,411 --> 01:18:36,742
MAVERICK: Ice water.

1164
01:18:41,584 --> 01:18:44,075
CHARLIE: You weren't going
to say good-bye?

1165
01:18:46,088 --> 01:18:49,546
I heard you got that job
in Washington.

1166
01:18:49,592 --> 01:18:51,059
Congratulations.

1167
01:18:51,093 --> 01:18:52,583
Thanks.

1168
01:18:55,097 --> 01:18:58,589
But I wasn't gonna leave
without saying good-bye.

1169
01:19:01,537 --> 01:19:03,528
It's good to see you.

1170
01:19:04,540 --> 01:19:05,529
CHARLIE: Thanks.

1171
01:19:07,543 --> 01:19:09,033
Where you going?

1172
01:19:10,546 --> 01:19:13,379
You don't even have a ticket,
do you?

1173
01:19:14,417 --> 01:19:19,013
I've seen all the evidence.
It's not your responsibility.

1174
01:19:19,055 --> 01:19:20,716
It's not your fault.

1175
01:19:22,058 --> 01:19:25,550
You're one of the best pilots
in the Navy.

1176
01:19:26,562 --> 01:19:30,054
What you do up there,
it's dangerous.

1177
01:19:31,233 --> 01:19:33,724
But you've got to go on.

1178
01:19:33,769 --> 01:19:35,828
You don't understand.

1179
01:19:37,073 --> 01:19:40,042
When I first met you...

1180
01:19:40,076 --> 01:19:42,567
you were larger than life.

1181
01:19:44,413 --> 01:19:46,040
Look at you.

1182
01:19:47,083 --> 01:19:51,076
You're not going to be happy
unless you're going mach two...

1183
01:19:51,120 --> 01:19:53,145
with your hair on fire.
You know that.

1184
01:19:53,189 --> 01:19:56,215
Naw, it's over. It's just over.

1185
01:19:56,258 --> 01:19:57,850
CHARLIE:
To be the best of the best...

1186
01:19:57,893 --> 01:20:01,226
means you make mistakes,
and then you go on.

1187
01:20:01,263 --> 01:20:02,730
It's just like the rest of us.

1188
01:20:02,765 --> 01:20:05,256
MAVERICK:
You don't think I know that?

1189
01:20:06,602 --> 01:20:09,093
I'm here to help.

1190
01:20:10,239 --> 01:20:13,072
Look, thank you.

1191
01:20:13,109 --> 01:20:18,376
But if I wanted help, really,
I would have asked for it.

1192
01:20:23,619 --> 01:20:25,610
So I'm too late.

1193
01:20:28,124 --> 01:20:29,614
You've already left.

1194
01:20:31,127 --> 01:20:34,221
You didn't learn
a damn thing, did you?

1195
01:20:35,297 --> 01:20:36,787
Except to quit.

1196
01:20:40,136 --> 01:20:43,128
You've got that maneuver down
real well.

1197
01:20:51,147 --> 01:20:53,172
So long, Pete Mitchell.

1198
01:21:15,104 --> 01:21:16,594
[Rings doorbell]

1199
01:21:18,607 --> 01:21:21,405
MRS. METCALF:
Well, hi, Maverick. Come on in.

1200
01:21:21,444 --> 01:21:24,242
-How you doing?
-Good.

1201
01:21:24,280 --> 01:21:26,908
-You sure you're feeling OK?
-Fine. Great.

1202
01:21:26,949 --> 01:21:30,749
-Can I get you a drink?
-No, thank you.

1203
01:21:30,786 --> 01:21:34,244
Make yourself comfortable.
Mike will be right down.

1204
01:21:34,290 --> 01:21:35,780
OK. Thank you.

1205
01:21:54,143 --> 01:21:56,703
I flew with your old man.

1206
01:21:56,746 --> 01:21:58,805
VF-51, the Oriskany.

1207
01:22:01,584 --> 01:22:05,577
You're a lot like he was,
only better...

1208
01:22:07,590 --> 01:22:09,080
and worse.

1209
01:22:10,593 --> 01:22:14,085
He was a natural heroic
son of a bitch, that one.

1210
01:22:16,932 --> 01:22:19,492
So, he did do it right.

1211
01:22:23,939 --> 01:22:26,464
Yeah, he did it right.

1212
01:22:35,618 --> 01:22:39,076
VIPER: Is that why you fly
the way you do...

1213
01:22:39,121 --> 01:22:40,611
trying to prove something?

1214
01:22:42,124 --> 01:22:45,116
Yeah, your old man did it right.

1215
01:22:46,629 --> 01:22:49,598
What I'm about to tell you
is classified.

1216
01:22:49,632 --> 01:22:51,657
It could end my career.

1217
01:22:51,700 --> 01:22:54,362
We were in the worst dogfight
I ever dreamed of.

1218
01:22:54,403 --> 01:22:57,964
There were bogeys like fireflies
all over the sky.

1219
01:23:00,075 --> 01:23:01,702
His F-4 was hit,
and he was wounded...

1220
01:23:01,744 --> 01:23:02,870
but he could have made it back.

1221
01:23:02,912 --> 01:23:04,072
He stayed in it.

1222
01:23:04,113 --> 01:23:06,138
Saved three planes
before he bought it.

1223
01:23:09,418 --> 01:23:10,976
MAVERICK: How come I never
heard that before?

1224
01:23:11,020 --> 01:23:13,682
That's not something the State
Department tells dependents...

1225
01:23:13,722 --> 01:23:17,249
when the battle occurred
over the wrong line on some map.

1226
01:23:18,761 --> 01:23:20,228
MAVERICK: So you were there?

1227
01:23:20,262 --> 01:23:22,093
VIPER: I was there.

1228
01:23:23,098 --> 01:23:24,656
What's on your mind?

1229
01:23:26,101 --> 01:23:28,262
My options, sir.

1230
01:23:29,605 --> 01:23:30,765
Simple.

1231
01:23:31,874 --> 01:23:34,069
First, you've acquired enough
points to show up tomorrow...

1232
01:23:34,109 --> 01:23:36,737
and graduate
with your Top Gun class...

1233
01:23:36,779 --> 01:23:38,679
or you could quit.

1234
01:23:40,816 --> 01:23:43,080
There'd be no disgrace.
That spin was hell.

1235
01:23:43,118 --> 01:23:44,915
It would've shook me up.

1236
01:23:44,954 --> 01:23:46,649
So you think I should quit?

1237
01:23:46,689 --> 01:23:48,281
I didn't say that.

1238
01:23:50,092 --> 01:23:53,584
The simple fact is you
feel responsible for Goose...

1239
01:23:53,629 --> 01:23:55,392
and you have
a confidence problem.

1240
01:23:56,999 --> 01:24:00,400
I'm not going to sit here
and bIow sunshine up your ass.

1241
01:24:00,436 --> 01:24:05,135
A good pilot is compelled
to evaluate what's happened...

1242
01:24:05,174 --> 01:24:07,005
so he can apply
what he's learned.

1243
01:24:08,577 --> 01:24:11,546
Up there, we got to push it.

1244
01:24:11,580 --> 01:24:13,047
That's our job.

1245
01:24:15,751 --> 01:24:17,548
It's your option, Lieutenant...

1246
01:24:17,586 --> 01:24:19,247
all yours.

1247
01:24:30,099 --> 01:24:33,626
Sorry to bother you
on a Sunday, sir...

1248
01:24:33,669 --> 01:24:35,364
but thank you very much
for your time.

1249
01:24:35,404 --> 01:24:38,464
VIPER: No problem. Good luck.

1250
01:25:23,052 --> 01:25:25,020
[Applause]

1251
01:25:27,423 --> 01:25:28,685
Gentlemen...

1252
01:25:28,724 --> 01:25:30,055
Where's Maverick?

1253
01:25:31,427 --> 01:25:33,327
I don't know where he is.

1254
01:25:35,030 --> 01:25:37,055
You know what
he's planning to do?

1255
01:25:38,834 --> 01:25:40,893
Got to be hard on the guy,
though, you know.

1256
01:25:40,936 --> 01:25:42,096
Good luck.

1257
01:26:02,558 --> 01:26:04,048
Hi, Mav.

1258
01:26:12,901 --> 01:26:14,698
Congratulations.

1259
01:26:14,737 --> 01:26:16,136
Thank you.

1260
01:26:17,139 --> 01:26:19,539
-Congratulations.
-Thanks, Mav.

1261
01:26:19,575 --> 01:26:20,735
Sir.

1262
01:26:23,579 --> 01:26:26,241
Gentlemen,
I hate to break up the party...

1263
01:26:26,281 --> 01:26:28,272
before it really
gets out of hand...

1264
01:26:28,317 --> 01:26:29,978
but there's work to be done.

1265
01:26:30,019 --> 01:26:32,886
Some of you have to depart
immediately.

1266
01:26:32,921 --> 01:26:35,321
We have a crisis situation.

1267
01:26:35,357 --> 01:26:37,723
-Ice, Slider!
-Yo.

1268
01:26:37,760 --> 01:26:39,352
-Hollywood, Wolfman!
-Yes, sir.

1269
01:26:41,430 --> 01:26:42,795
Maverick!

1270
01:26:42,831 --> 01:26:44,093
Sir.

1271
01:26:47,603 --> 01:26:51,403
Maverick, you'll get your R.I.O.
when you get to your ship.

1272
01:26:51,440 --> 01:26:55,399
And if you don't...
give me a call.

1273
01:26:55,444 --> 01:26:57,036
I'II fly with you.

1274
01:26:58,781 --> 01:26:59,941
Sir.

1275
01:27:09,614 --> 01:27:11,582
AIR BOSS JOHNSON:
Gentlemen, this is bull's eye.

1276
01:27:11,616 --> 01:27:13,140
The communications ship,
S.S. Layton...

1277
01:27:13,185 --> 01:27:17,451
has become disabled and wandered
into foreign territory.

1278
01:27:17,489 --> 01:27:20,322
A rescue operation
is to begin within the hour.

1279
01:27:20,358 --> 01:27:23,293
Your mission is to give
air support to that rescue.

1280
01:27:24,029 --> 01:27:26,623
There are MIGs in the area,
and tensions are high.

1281
01:27:26,665 --> 01:27:30,499
If you witness a hostile act,
you will return fire.

1282
01:27:30,535 --> 01:27:33,993
Those MIGs carry
the Exocet antiship missile.

1283
01:27:34,039 --> 01:27:36,337
They can fire them
from 100 miles away.

1284
01:27:36,374 --> 01:27:38,308
Gentlemen,
this is the real thing.

1285
01:27:38,343 --> 01:27:41,335
This is what
you've been trained for.

1286
01:27:41,379 --> 01:27:43,506
You are America's best.

1287
01:27:43,548 --> 01:27:45,175
Make us proud.

1288
01:27:45,217 --> 01:27:46,343
-Ice.
-Yes, sir.

1289
01:27:46,384 --> 01:27:47,510
-Hollywood.
-Yes, sir.

1290
01:27:47,552 --> 01:27:48,814
Sector 2.

1291
01:27:48,853 --> 01:27:51,321
Maverick, you back them up
with Merlin on ready five.

1292
01:27:52,724 --> 01:27:54,055
Yes, sir.

1293
01:27:55,560 --> 01:27:56,686
Rise!

1294
01:27:58,496 --> 01:27:59,963
Excuse me, sir.

1295
01:27:59,998 --> 01:28:01,465
This is not personal...

1296
01:28:01,499 --> 01:28:04,559
but with regard to Maverick,
is he the best--

1297
01:28:04,603 --> 01:28:08,004
JOHNSON: I know what you're
thinking. Just get on it.

1298
01:29:24,482 --> 01:29:26,780
ICEMAN: Mustang, can you
give me a mode four check?

1299
01:29:26,818 --> 01:29:30,310
Voodoo-one, you got a pair
of bogeys, 12 o'cIock, 15 miles.

1300
01:29:30,355 --> 01:29:32,516
Voodoo-one, zero-nine-zero.

1301
01:29:32,557 --> 01:29:34,616
Radar contact 15 miles.

1302
01:29:34,659 --> 01:29:36,354
They're doing 500 knots.

1303
01:29:36,394 --> 01:29:37,656
Roger. That's your bogey.

1304
01:29:41,066 --> 01:29:42,533
SLIDER:
Got 'em dead ahead. 15 miles.

1305
01:29:42,567 --> 01:29:43,966
Air speed is 600 knots.

1306
01:29:47,472 --> 01:29:48,700
SLIDER:
Bogeys just hit 650.

1307
01:29:48,740 --> 01:29:50,674
Let's take a wider split.

1308
01:29:52,911 --> 01:29:55,846
They're at 15,000 feet.
Dead ahead, 10 miles.

1309
01:29:55,880 --> 01:29:57,006
Air speed is still increasing.

1310
01:29:57,048 --> 01:29:58,538
800 knots.

1311
01:29:58,583 --> 01:29:59,982
Dead ahead now. Eight miles.

1312
01:30:00,018 --> 01:30:01,451
Dead ahead now. Eight miles.

1313
01:30:01,486 --> 01:30:02,680
'Wood, you got 'em?

1314
01:30:02,721 --> 01:30:03,983
Not yet. I can't see 'em.

1315
01:30:04,022 --> 01:30:06,013
They must be close.
I'm getting a hard-on.

1316
01:30:13,231 --> 01:30:15,461
'Wood, I'm taking the lead.
Let's identify 'em.

1317
01:30:15,500 --> 01:30:16,967
HOLLYWOOD:
Roger. You got the lead.

1318
01:30:17,001 --> 01:30:19,265
I'm on your left side,
a little low.

1319
01:30:20,572 --> 01:30:22,540
Maverick's up and ready
in alert five.

1320
01:30:22,574 --> 01:30:23,734
Good, good.

1321
01:30:26,311 --> 01:30:28,779
SLIDER: Hollywood,
my bogey's still locked up.

1322
01:30:28,813 --> 01:30:30,781
He's drifting to the left.

1323
01:30:30,815 --> 01:30:33,340
Still maneuvering on course
zero-nine-zero.

1324
01:30:33,385 --> 01:30:35,785
ICEMAN: OK, 'Wood,
let's bring it to the right...

1325
01:30:35,820 --> 01:30:37,845
and we'll get
a better angle on him.

1326
01:30:46,698 --> 01:30:48,666
SLIDER:
Ice, we got a problem here.

1327
01:30:48,700 --> 01:30:50,190
We've got four aircraft
on radar.

1328
01:30:50,235 --> 01:30:52,829
Not one pair, two pair.
Repeat, four bogeys!

1329
01:30:52,871 --> 01:30:54,702
'Wood, we got four bogeys.

1330
01:30:57,308 --> 01:30:58,468
Make that five!

1331
01:30:58,510 --> 01:30:59,477
There's five, sir.

1332
01:30:59,511 --> 01:31:00,569
That's five?

1333
01:31:00,612 --> 01:31:01,601
Yes, sir.

1334
01:31:03,515 --> 01:31:04,743
Oh, shit!

1335
01:31:04,783 --> 01:31:06,808
He's got a radar lock on us.

1336
01:31:09,220 --> 01:31:11,984
Get out of there, Hollywood,
God damn it!

1337
01:31:19,431 --> 01:31:20,796
Break left!

1338
01:31:20,832 --> 01:31:22,800
I'm hit! We're coming apart!

1339
01:31:22,834 --> 01:31:24,096
I can't control it!

1340
01:31:24,135 --> 01:31:26,365
We're going down!

1341
01:31:26,404 --> 01:31:27,871
'Wood's been hit!

1342
01:31:27,906 --> 01:31:29,032
Shit!

1343
01:31:29,073 --> 01:31:31,041
Voodoo-one, Wood's been hit!

1344
01:31:31,075 --> 01:31:32,542
We've lost Hollywood.

1345
01:31:32,577 --> 01:31:34,442
We've lost our wingman.

1346
01:31:34,479 --> 01:31:36,606
Launch Maverick on alert five.

1347
01:31:36,648 --> 01:31:39,116
Get a bearing
on Hollywood and Wolfman...

1348
01:31:39,150 --> 01:31:41,641
and launch the rescue helicopter
immediately.

1349
01:32:07,345 --> 01:32:08,437
Maverick's airborne.

1350
01:32:08,480 --> 01:32:09,811
MERLIN:
Iceman, what's your position?

1351
01:32:09,848 --> 01:32:12,180
ICEMAN:
Zero-nine-zero at 180 miles.

1352
01:32:12,217 --> 01:32:14,310
On the left!

1353
01:32:14,352 --> 01:32:16,411
Three MIGs, dead ahead,
coming down the left side!

1354
01:32:18,890 --> 01:32:20,050
ICEMAN:
I'm going after them.

1355
01:32:20,091 --> 01:32:21,285
I'm breaking around
to the left.

1356
01:32:23,895 --> 01:32:26,887
SLIDER: Four on our tail.
That makes six of them.

1357
01:32:26,931 --> 01:32:28,398
Lead MIG is coming
into gun range.

1358
01:32:33,538 --> 01:32:35,028
He's firing. Break right!

1359
01:32:37,242 --> 01:32:38,903
Mustang,
we are totally defensive!

1360
01:32:38,943 --> 01:32:39,932
Launch the alert fighters!

1361
01:32:39,978 --> 01:32:41,104
Where are they?

1362
01:32:41,145 --> 01:32:43,841
One hundred sixty miles
and closing in fast, sir.

1363
01:32:43,882 --> 01:32:45,577
Ready Willard and Simkin
off 'Cats Three and Four.

1364
01:32:48,520 --> 01:32:50,750
Maverick's supersonic.
I'II be there in 30 seconds.

1365
01:32:50,788 --> 01:32:52,915
ICEMAN: Haul your ass!
I'm engaged with five!

1366
01:32:52,957 --> 01:32:54,322
I'm in deep shit!

1367
01:32:56,961 --> 01:32:58,258
What about Willard and Simkin?

1368
01:32:58,296 --> 01:32:59,731
Both catapults are broken.

1369
01:32:59,731 --> 01:33:01,528
We can't launch
any aircraft yet, sir.

1370
01:33:01,566 --> 01:33:03,500
-How long?
-It'll take 10 minutes.

1371
01:33:03,535 --> 01:33:04,661
Bullshit, 10 minutes.

1372
01:33:04,702 --> 01:33:06,761
This thing will be over
in 2 minutes.

1373
01:33:09,340 --> 01:33:10,466
MIG, 12 o'clock high!

1374
01:33:10,508 --> 01:33:11,805
MIG, 12 o'clock high!

1375
01:33:11,843 --> 01:33:13,401
Watch your back!

1376
01:33:19,250 --> 01:33:20,239
Break right!

1377
01:33:22,754 --> 01:33:24,016
ICEMAN:
Shit, that was close.

1378
01:33:24,055 --> 01:33:25,579
Maverick, how about some help?

1379
01:33:25,623 --> 01:33:27,784
Come on, kid. Hang in there.

1380
01:33:29,861 --> 01:33:31,385
Jesus Christ!

1381
01:33:33,631 --> 01:33:35,724
Maverick, how about some help?
Engage, damn it!

1382
01:33:38,069 --> 01:33:39,297
He's on our tail!

1383
01:33:42,540 --> 01:33:43,666
Watch out!

1384
01:33:46,911 --> 01:33:49,004
Shit, we just flew
right through his jetwash!

1385
01:33:51,449 --> 01:33:53,178
Get control, get control!

1386
01:34:00,692 --> 01:34:02,819
MERLIN:
Good recovery, Mav.

1387
01:34:02,860 --> 01:34:04,259
OK, let's get in there.

1388
01:34:04,295 --> 01:34:06,627
Come on, we got to help Ice.

1389
01:34:06,664 --> 01:34:08,632
Let's get back in the game,
Maverick!

1390
01:34:08,666 --> 01:34:09,792
MAVERICK: It's no good.

1391
01:34:09,834 --> 01:34:11,529
MERLIN:
Get in there, Maverick!

1392
01:34:14,339 --> 01:34:16,330
God damn it!
Maverick's disengaging.

1393
01:34:16,374 --> 01:34:17,739
I knew it! Shit!

1394
01:34:17,775 --> 01:34:19,572
God damn it, Maverick!

1395
01:34:22,680 --> 01:34:24,739
MERLIN:
Maverick, you can't leave him !

1396
01:34:24,782 --> 01:34:26,079
Maverick, what are you doing?

1397
01:34:26,117 --> 01:34:28,608
MAVERICK: Talk to me, Goose.

1398
01:34:28,653 --> 01:34:29,950
MERLIN: Ice is in trouble!

1399
01:34:29,988 --> 01:34:31,615
MAVERICK: Talk to me, Goose.

1400
01:34:31,656 --> 01:34:33,146
MERLIN: He won't last alone!

1401
01:34:33,191 --> 01:34:35,125
Get in the fight,
for God's sake!

1402
01:34:35,159 --> 01:34:36,126
Maverick!

1403
01:34:36,160 --> 01:34:37,354
Maverick!

1404
01:34:40,098 --> 01:34:41,258
Maverick's re-engaging, sir.

1405
01:34:47,538 --> 01:34:48,835
I can't shake them !

1406
01:34:48,873 --> 01:34:50,841
Ice, I've got your MIG
dead ahead.

1407
01:34:50,875 --> 01:34:52,240
I've got him dead ahead.

1408
01:34:53,645 --> 01:34:55,340
Good tone. I've got good tone.

1409
01:34:55,380 --> 01:34:58,213
I got tone! Firing!

1410
01:35:07,825 --> 01:35:09,725
Where? Where are they?

1411
01:35:09,761 --> 01:35:11,424
One hundred fifty five miles.

1412
01:35:11,557 --> 01:35:13,684
Two MIGs dead ahead.
Closure 800 miles an hour!

1413
01:35:13,726 --> 01:35:14,693
I see 'em.

1414
01:35:14,727 --> 01:35:16,718
I'm gonna take 'em
down the left side.

1415
01:35:18,364 --> 01:35:19,592
MERLIN: Oh, my God!

1416
01:35:22,568 --> 01:35:25,560
Ice is right below us.
He's got a MIG on his tail.

1417
01:35:27,506 --> 01:35:29,098
He's firing! Break left!

1418
01:35:32,445 --> 01:35:33,571
He overshot!

1419
01:35:33,612 --> 01:35:34,601
He overshot!

1420
01:35:35,614 --> 01:35:37,411
I'm coming in, Ice.

1421
01:35:39,986 --> 01:35:41,248
Two MIGs dead ahead.

1422
01:35:42,888 --> 01:35:45,857
I got him, Mav,
one MIG passing between us.

1423
01:35:48,995 --> 01:35:51,327
MIG on your left, three o'clock!

1424
01:35:51,364 --> 01:35:53,025
He's going to fire!

1425
01:36:00,706 --> 01:36:03,698
Maverick, check the guys
to the north!

1426
01:36:06,112 --> 01:36:07,602
Banking left, banking left!

1427
01:36:10,082 --> 01:36:11,481
There he is!

1428
01:36:11,517 --> 01:36:12,506
Get him, Ice. Get him !

1429
01:36:12,551 --> 01:36:13,916
OK, you guys, I'm coming in.

1430
01:36:19,558 --> 01:36:22,686
Maverick, got a MIG on our tail!
We gotta get out!

1431
01:36:22,728 --> 01:36:23,888
I can't leave Ice.

1432
01:36:23,929 --> 01:36:26,591
He's still coming around!
He's gonna get behind us!

1433
01:36:26,632 --> 01:36:28,793
I'm not leaving my wingman.

1434
01:36:31,470 --> 01:36:32,937
I'm on his tail.

1435
01:36:32,972 --> 01:36:35,497
I'm going for it. I'm going
for the shot right now.

1436
01:36:35,541 --> 01:36:37,566
Roger, engage!

1437
01:36:39,612 --> 01:36:42,103
I've got radar lock.

1438
01:36:42,148 --> 01:36:43,615
I'm taking a shot!

1439
01:36:43,649 --> 01:36:44,809
Fire!

1440
01:36:48,921 --> 01:36:51,014
-Bingo!
-Wash that sucker!

1441
01:36:51,057 --> 01:36:52,524
Ice, MIG to your right!

1442
01:36:52,558 --> 01:36:53,718
He's firing!

1443
01:36:55,628 --> 01:36:57,118
I'm hit, I'm hit!

1444
01:36:59,331 --> 01:37:00,730
We're hit in the right engine!

1445
01:37:00,766 --> 01:37:01,926
I'm shutting it down!

1446
01:37:06,739 --> 01:37:08,138
Coming in, Ice.

1447
01:37:12,244 --> 01:37:15,236
That bogey's still behind you.
I'm maneuvering for a shot.

1448
01:37:15,281 --> 01:37:18,478
ICEMAN: Stay with him, Mav!
Take the shot! Nail him !

1449
01:37:18,517 --> 01:37:20,451
Ice, I can't get a tone.

1450
01:37:20,486 --> 01:37:22,454
Shoot, Maverick!
I can't get him off my tail!

1451
01:37:27,126 --> 01:37:28,593
Maverick, we're hit again!

1452
01:37:28,627 --> 01:37:30,788
It's OK.
Both engines are functioning.

1453
01:37:30,830 --> 01:37:33,890
Ice, on the count of three,
break hard right.

1454
01:37:33,933 --> 01:37:35,025
Three...

1455
01:37:35,067 --> 01:37:36,227
two...

1456
01:37:36,268 --> 01:37:37,235
one!

1457
01:37:37,269 --> 01:37:38,258
Break right!

1458
01:37:41,640 --> 01:37:42,629
Firing!

1459
01:37:46,278 --> 01:37:47,609
Damn it, I missed!

1460
01:37:47,646 --> 01:37:50,114
ICEMAN: Don't let him go.
Keep on him, Mav!

1461
01:37:50,149 --> 01:37:51,639
I got him.

1462
01:37:53,519 --> 01:37:54,952
Here comes a shot.

1463
01:38:00,159 --> 01:38:01,319
Concrete!

1464
01:38:03,496 --> 01:38:06,397
Maverick, move!
There's a MIG on your tail!

1465
01:38:06,432 --> 01:38:08,525
We've only got one missile left.

1466
01:38:08,567 --> 01:38:10,296
Approaching 110 miles, sir.

1467
01:38:10,336 --> 01:38:11,564
God damn it!

1468
01:38:11,604 --> 01:38:14,505
MERLIN: I got him !
He's on us! He's on our tail!

1469
01:38:17,243 --> 01:38:18,232
Shit!

1470
01:38:21,180 --> 01:38:23,375
You haven't lost him !
He's still with us!

1471
01:38:27,920 --> 01:38:30,218
What are you doing?
You're slowing down!

1472
01:38:30,256 --> 01:38:31,723
I'm bringing him in closer.

1473
01:38:31,757 --> 01:38:32,951
You're gonna do what?

1474
01:38:38,297 --> 01:38:39,525
This is it, Maverick!

1475
01:38:39,565 --> 01:38:41,533
I'm gonna hit the brakes.
He'll fly right by.

1476
01:38:41,567 --> 01:38:42,932
He'll get a lock!

1477
01:38:46,739 --> 01:38:47,728
Now!

1478
01:38:53,078 --> 01:38:54,545
I got a good lock.

1479
01:38:54,580 --> 01:38:55,569
Firing.

1480
01:38:59,318 --> 01:39:00,876
Whoo! Scratch four!

1481
01:39:05,357 --> 01:39:07,086
Mustang, this is Voodoo-three.

1482
01:39:07,126 --> 01:39:08,787
Remaining MIGs are bugging out.

1484
01:39:23,943 --> 01:39:27,208

requesting flyby.

1485
01:39:27,246 --> 01:39:29,737
Negative, Ghost Rider,
the pattern is full.

1486
01:39:32,318 --> 01:39:35,253
Excuse me.
Something I should know about?

1487
01:39:47,266 --> 01:39:48,756
Thank you.

1488
01:39:53,672 --> 01:39:55,299

1489
01:40:19,565 --> 01:40:21,032
Yeah!

1490
01:40:51,363 --> 01:40:52,523
You!

1491
01:40:55,801 --> 01:40:58,292
You are still dangerous.

1492
01:41:01,674 --> 01:41:04,438
But you can be my wingman
anytime.

1493
01:41:05,744 --> 01:41:06,870
Bullshit.

1494
01:41:06,912 --> 01:41:08,470
You can be mine.

1495
01:41:59,832 --> 01:42:03,290
Maverick. How does it feel
to be on the front page...

1496
01:42:03,335 --> 01:42:05,929
of every newspaper
in the English-speaking world?

1497
01:42:05,971 --> 01:42:07,768
Even though the other side
denies the incident...

1498
01:42:07,806 --> 01:42:08,966
congratulations.

1499
01:42:09,007 --> 01:42:10,133
Thank you, sir.

1500
01:42:10,175 --> 01:42:11,972
They gave you
your choice of duty--

1501
01:42:12,010 --> 01:42:13,477
anything, anywhere.
You believe that?

1502
01:42:13,512 --> 01:42:16,811
Where do you think
you want to go?

1503
01:42:16,849 --> 01:42:20,444
I thought of being
an instructor, sir.

1587
01:47:29,812 --> 01:47:32,713
I want to ride
on the silver dove...

1588
01:47:32,748 --> 01:47:34,909

1589
01:47:34,951 --> 01:47:38,717

across the sky.

1596
01:48:22,665 --> 01:48:23,723
Oh...
