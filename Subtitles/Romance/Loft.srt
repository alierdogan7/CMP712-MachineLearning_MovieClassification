1
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:51,328
I've got nothing to do with this.
You have to believe me.

2
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:55,590
We'd love to, Mr Stevens. But your
story really is rather... strange.

3
00:01:55,744 --> 00:02:00,044
Listen. We were set up. It was staged.
- So you're saying you were framed?

4
00:02:00,237 --> 00:02:05,344
That you are a victim?
- Well, no. Not exactly. Not like...

5
00:02:05,497 --> 00:02:08,531
Not like who, Mr Stevens?
Not like her?

6
00:02:09,222 --> 00:02:11,065
Not like this?

7
00:02:13,215 --> 00:02:16,825
Did you question the others yet?
- Don't worry, we're on it.

8
00:02:16,979 --> 00:02:19,858
So what you're saying is
it's all one big conspiracy?

9
00:02:20,011 --> 00:02:23,275
Why don't you just make it
easy for yourself and confess?

10
00:02:24,888 --> 00:02:27,269
Tell us again
what happened this morning.

11
00:02:27,423 --> 00:02:29,650
Again?
- Again, Mr Stevens.

12
00:02:29,803 --> 00:02:33,067
From the beginning,
if you don't mind...

13
00:05:10,272 --> 00:05:13,766
Where were you this morning, Mr Stevens?
- At home.

14
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:17,645
My wife has taken the kids skiing.
- Not any more. She's on her way here.

15
00:05:17,798 --> 00:05:20,217
She seemed to have
a lot of questions as well.

16
00:05:20,370 --> 00:05:23,251
The phone woke you this morning.
What time was that?

17
00:05:23,404 --> 00:05:26,860
It was about half past ten.
It was Luc. He was in a real panic.

18
00:05:27,013 --> 00:05:29,356
I had to come over right away,
it was serious.

19
00:05:29,548 --> 00:05:32,120
Luc Seynaeve?
- Luc, yes. Luc.

20
00:05:32,312 --> 00:05:37,035
Where did you have to come over to?
- The loft. I had to come to the loft.

21
00:05:37,227 --> 00:05:40,299
Did he say why he was in such a panic?
- No.

22
00:05:40,530 --> 00:05:45,061
Did you know why he was in a panic?
- No. Not at the time.

23
00:05:56,964 --> 00:06:01,265
Luc?

24
00:06:03,415 --> 00:06:05,143
What's the matter?

25
00:06:10,365 --> 00:06:11,671
Jesus Christ!

26
00:06:13,130 --> 00:06:18,698
What the hell happened?
- I swear I really don't know, Vincent.

27
00:06:25,456 --> 00:06:29,220
Did you have anything to do with this?
- Of course not. I found her like that.

28
00:06:30,526 --> 00:06:34,826
Don't touch her. Wait for the police.
- Have you called the police?

29
00:06:34,979 --> 00:06:37,706
Not yet, but...
- Let's not call the police yet, OK?

30
00:06:39,664 --> 00:06:41,162
Jesus Christ, man!

31
00:06:42,467 --> 00:06:47,728
Shit! Have you called the others?
- Marnix and Chris are on their way.

32
00:06:47,881 --> 00:06:52,336
I couldn't get hold of Filip.
- Everyone needs to get over here, now.

33
00:06:52,643 --> 00:06:54,793
Who is she? Do you know?

34
00:06:55,408 --> 00:06:57,673
Do you know who that is?
- Of course not.

35
00:06:58,019 --> 00:06:59,209
Where'd they break in?

36
00:06:59,363 --> 00:07:02,473
Nowhere. The door was locked
and the alarm switched off.

37
00:07:02,665 --> 00:07:05,967
No way!
- The door was locked and the alarm off!

38
00:07:06,121 --> 00:07:09,423
No way. Cos that means...
- I know.

39
00:07:09,577 --> 00:07:13,263
Someone must've used
one of our keys to get in.

40
00:07:14,530 --> 00:07:17,564
Jesus, Luc.
What happened here?

41
00:07:20,444 --> 00:07:23,400
Do you know the building on
Tavernierkaai, Mr Seynaeve?

42
00:07:23,554 --> 00:07:28,238
Your good pal Vincent Stevens' project.
- Vincent's got lots of projects.

43
00:07:28,392 --> 00:07:32,386
There's a loft on the top floor.
Does that ring any bells?

44
00:07:32,539 --> 00:07:35,688
You've never been there?
- No.

45
00:07:35,842 --> 00:07:39,796
Strange... We were told that
you share the loft with your friends.

46
00:07:39,988 --> 00:07:43,329
In secret, without your wives knowing.

47
00:07:45,787 --> 00:07:48,167
That's ridiculous.
- Is it?

48
00:07:48,437 --> 00:07:50,894
Don't you sometimes
take someone up there?

49
00:07:51,047 --> 00:07:54,503
Mistress, one-night stand, latest catch?
- That's just...

50
00:07:54,657 --> 00:07:57,613
Five good pals who want some privacy
while they fool around.

51
00:07:57,767 --> 00:08:01,491
No hotel or VISA bills
that your wife might find.

52
00:08:01,645 --> 00:08:04,947
That's ridiculous.
- Don't play innocent.

53
00:08:05,102 --> 00:08:07,444
One of your pals
has already confessed.

54
00:08:09,709 --> 00:08:14,816
That surprises you, eh?
Don't you want to know who?

55
00:08:15,891 --> 00:08:18,887
I don't do that kind of thing. I...
- You love your wife.

56
00:08:19,808 --> 00:08:23,072
Yes. I love my wife. I do.

57
00:08:24,492 --> 00:08:28,448
What happened to your eye, Mr Seynaeve?
- I walked into a cupboard.

58
00:08:28,602 --> 00:08:31,289
Have you been in a fight?
- I walked into a cupboard.

59
00:08:31,712 --> 00:08:36,089
Where were you this morning?
- I had breakfast in town with Chris.

60
00:08:36,242 --> 00:08:38,393
I've got witnesses.
- Chris Van Outryve.

61
00:08:38,585 --> 00:08:42,195
Dr Chris Van Outryve. The psychiatrist.
- One of your loft pals.

62
00:08:42,386 --> 00:08:46,918
Chris is married, he has kids. He's not
the kind of guy to cheat on his wife.

63
00:08:48,607 --> 00:08:51,641
Well, well, all regular family men.

64
00:08:56,940 --> 00:09:00,012
Where is she?
- We've got a serious problem, Chris.

65
00:09:17,483 --> 00:09:19,403
Jesus!

66
00:09:20,401 --> 00:09:23,704
Filip...
- What did you say, Chris? Filip?

67
00:09:24,126 --> 00:09:27,313
D'you think your brother's involved?
- I don't know...

68
00:09:27,505 --> 00:09:30,308
We'll get the blame for this.
Elsie and the kids...

69
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:32,996
We've got to call the cops.
- Hold on, Chris.

70
00:09:33,495 --> 00:09:36,567
You know what'll happen.
Or do you want Ellen to find out?

71
00:09:36,721 --> 00:09:38,641
There's a body!
We've got no choice.

72
00:09:38,794 --> 00:09:44,285
If Filip is involved, we're going
to have to report your brother.

73
00:09:44,708 --> 00:09:48,202
He's the first one you thought of
too, eh? Remember last time?

74
00:09:48,356 --> 00:09:50,467
Or have you already forgotten?
- No.

75
00:09:50,659 --> 00:09:53,846
We're thinking the same thing,
aren't we, Chris?

76
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:59,145
We can help him. We're pals. If he tells
us what happened, maybe we can...

77
00:09:59,337 --> 00:10:03,561
Maybe we can what?
Dump her body somewhere? You're crazy!

78
00:10:03,715 --> 00:10:07,516
Listen, I'm not taking the fall
for his stupid mistakes, OK?

79
00:10:10,818 --> 00:10:12,701
What the hell's going on?

80
00:10:14,851 --> 00:10:17,001
Son of a bitch!

81
00:10:17,693 --> 00:10:19,766
We've got a serious problem.
- Christ!

82
00:10:19,919 --> 00:10:23,298
D'you know if Filip was here last night?
- I don't believe this!

83
00:10:26,486 --> 00:10:30,364
What are you going to do?

84
00:10:30,517 --> 00:10:33,704
I want to see her.
- Jesus Christ, man!

85
00:10:34,857 --> 00:10:35,893
Don't touch her.

86
00:10:38,389 --> 00:10:40,271
Don't touch her, Chris!

87
00:10:41,922 --> 00:10:44,148
Who is it?

88
00:10:45,262 --> 00:10:47,144
Who is it?
- I don't know.

89
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:51,905
None of us has got
anything to do with this, right?

90
00:10:52,404 --> 00:10:54,248
Right?
- We'll find out what happened,

91
00:10:54,402 --> 00:10:57,051
then deal with it.
We've gotta keep it quiet!

92
00:10:57,204 --> 00:10:59,739
We're pals! OK?

93
00:11:04,001 --> 00:11:06,881
1 year earlier

94
00:11:11,374 --> 00:11:15,098
Christ, they're letting anyone in!
- Hi, Vince. It's brilliant, man.

95
00:11:15,252 --> 00:11:20,128
Long time no see, Ellen. You look great!
- Thank you, Vincent.

96
00:11:20,282 --> 00:11:23,124
The design's brilliant. Congratulations.
- Thanks.

97
00:11:24,046 --> 00:11:27,270
Hello, Barbara.
- Hello. Hello, Ellen.

98
00:11:27,463 --> 00:11:30,573
Why don't you buy one of the apartments?
- Can't afford it.

99
00:11:30,765 --> 00:11:33,836
Of course not. With your small salary.
You poor soul!

100
00:11:34,221 --> 00:11:37,408
We'll catch each other later. OK?

101
00:11:38,675 --> 00:11:43,743
One hour, then we're out of here. OK?
- We've onlyjust got here. Don't start!

102
00:11:49,427 --> 00:11:53,075
Wow, man! Have you seen
all the good-looking chicks here?

103
00:11:54,150 --> 00:11:56,530
Look, that black chick there...

104
00:11:56,684 --> 00:11:59,219
Did you see that black chick?
- Take it easy!

105
00:11:59,449 --> 00:12:02,866
She's so hot! I wouldn't mind hacking
my way through the jungle with her!

106
00:12:03,058 --> 00:12:07,398
I'll even give her a head start!
- Calm down, Marnix. Miriam's watching.

107
00:12:07,551 --> 00:12:10,854
Oops, I'm in trouble now!
- Well? Having fun, tubby?

108
00:12:11,007 --> 00:12:14,233
Take it easy, pet.
We were just watching the guests.

109
00:12:14,386 --> 00:12:17,228
Don't embarrass me,
or I'll leave you here by yourself!

110
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:20,415
Promises, promises, darling!

111
00:12:20,569 --> 00:12:23,640
Luc. Isn't Elsie with you?
- She felt a bit dizzy.

112
00:12:23,794 --> 00:12:26,788
She's gone to measure her sugar level.
- How's she doing?

113
00:12:27,403 --> 00:12:31,205
Oh, here she is. How's things?
- I wasn't feeling too good

114
00:12:31,358 --> 00:12:34,392
but I'm OK now.
- We can always go home, sweetie.

115
00:12:34,852 --> 00:12:38,078
"Sweetie... "
She's just measured her sugar level!

116
00:12:38,231 --> 00:12:41,572
D'you think that's funny?
At least he's concerned about her.

117
00:12:41,726 --> 00:12:43,800
I wonder what you'd do
if that were me?

118
00:12:43,953 --> 00:12:48,100
I'd be only too happy to stick a needle
in your bum every day, sweetie!

119
00:12:57,700 --> 00:13:00,925
Can I ask you something?
You're a psychiatrist, right?

120
00:13:01,079 --> 00:13:03,190
Yes, I am. Chris Van Outryve.

121
00:13:03,344 --> 00:13:06,839
Dr Van Outryve, yes, that was it.

122
00:13:06,993 --> 00:13:09,565
Do we know each other?
- No. You knew my sister.

123
00:13:09,718 --> 00:13:14,288
You treated her. Sofie, Sofie Marai.

124
00:13:15,479 --> 00:13:18,627
I'm very sorry
about what happened to your sister.

125
00:13:18,819 --> 00:13:22,390
Some people are just born unhappy,
doctor. You must know that.

126
00:13:22,544 --> 00:13:25,808
We'd been making good progress
in the weeks before.

127
00:13:25,961 --> 00:13:29,532
But her last step forward wasn't
exactly a big success, was it?

128
00:13:29,993 --> 00:13:31,952
Off the tenth floor.

129
00:13:36,944 --> 00:13:41,244
Have you bought an apartment here?
- No, the architect's a friend of mine.

130
00:13:41,627 --> 00:13:43,471
You?
- Me? No, no.

131
00:13:43,625 --> 00:13:47,273
I came with the mayor. I work for him.

132
00:13:47,426 --> 00:13:49,883
I'm his...
personal assistant, shall we say.

133
00:13:50,383 --> 00:13:54,223
Oh. Interesting...
- No, not really.

134
00:13:54,837 --> 00:13:57,985
I'm Ann, Ann Marai.
- I'm sorry about your sister.

135
00:13:58,216 --> 00:14:01,556
No need to apologise.
You couldn't have saved her anyway.

136
00:14:01,711 --> 00:14:04,245
I'm afraid it runs in the family.

137
00:14:04,398 --> 00:14:07,278
You're not planning on
doing something stupid, are you?

138
00:14:07,432 --> 00:14:12,270
It's all I ever do, doctor.
I'm always falling for the wrong men!

139
00:14:24,904 --> 00:14:27,629
Everything's fine.
It's under control. Thanks.

140
00:14:27,783 --> 00:14:29,857
Are you OK? Thanks, pal...

141
00:14:30,126 --> 00:14:32,621
Filip.
- Hi, Vincenzo.

142
00:14:32,928 --> 00:14:34,541
Not your first party tonight?

143
00:14:34,811 --> 00:14:37,882
Sorry about my friend here!
I'll introduce you.

144
00:14:38,035 --> 00:14:40,263
She works with me.

145
00:14:40,455 --> 00:14:43,987
And she works under me.

146
00:14:45,984 --> 00:14:49,056
Oh no, my brother's coming
over to lecture me!

147
00:14:49,248 --> 00:14:51,744
Hello, Chris. How's things?

148
00:14:51,898 --> 00:14:54,125
Friends of Vicky's?
Or are you just babysitting?

149
00:14:54,316 --> 00:14:57,235
Hey, I'm still not married,
I can have a little fun!

150
00:14:57,389 --> 00:15:02,342
It's not that I don't love Vicky. I do.
But that doesn't mean I hate other women.

151
00:15:02,534 --> 00:15:06,528
I'm glad you came. I want to
show you something. Come with me.

152
00:15:06,988 --> 00:15:09,677
Where are Marnix and Luc?
- I don't know.

153
00:15:10,905 --> 00:15:14,284
Chris? Aren't you coming?

154
00:15:19,584 --> 00:15:21,004
There.

155
00:15:23,730 --> 00:15:26,418
What d'you think, guys?
- Fancy place!

156
00:15:26,610 --> 00:15:31,102
Very nice.
What are you going to do with it?

157
00:15:31,295 --> 00:15:34,636
It needs furnishing, but it's an oasis
of peace right in the city centre.

158
00:15:34,789 --> 00:15:36,939
Your oasis still needs some work.

159
00:15:37,131 --> 00:15:39,973
A place where nobody bothers you.
You can come here

160
00:15:40,127 --> 00:15:42,545
whenever you want,
with whoever you want.

161
00:15:42,699 --> 00:15:47,537
A place where you can...
how shall I put it? Steal time.

162
00:15:48,152 --> 00:15:49,188
Steal time?

163
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:53,643
So, should I sell it?
- D'you want to keep it for yourself?

164
00:15:54,373 --> 00:15:57,444
And a few friends, maybe.
- To do what?

165
00:15:57,597 --> 00:16:00,746
The waiters don't come up here, eh?
I'm going back down.

166
00:16:01,208 --> 00:16:05,431
Give me the key, so I can show
Filip's chicks your oasis!

167
00:16:05,585 --> 00:16:08,925
Laureys! Stay here!
Those are decent girls!

168
00:16:09,079 --> 00:16:11,038
D'you know how much they cost?

169
00:16:13,150 --> 00:16:16,836
Why would we rent a loft here?
- No one needs to know what you do here.

170
00:16:16,989 --> 00:16:21,367
But the idea that
you've got a secret place to go to...

171
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:26,320
Don't be stupid, you know what I mean.
- Yeah. But I'm not like that.

172
00:16:26,474 --> 00:16:29,968
I don't think Luc is, either.
- Aren't we all a bit like that?

173
00:16:30,122 --> 00:16:35,305
Or wouldn't we all like to be
a bit like that?

174
00:16:35,459 --> 00:16:37,302
If you say so...

175
00:16:37,610 --> 00:16:41,564
You can come here to read your paper,
if you like. For goodness sake...

176
00:16:52,162 --> 00:16:54,966
I've gotta get out of here.
I can't stay here.

177
00:16:55,119 --> 00:16:57,192
Luc. Where are you going? Luc? Luc!

178
00:16:58,191 --> 00:17:00,841
You can't fall apart now.
Not now.

179
00:17:00,995 --> 00:17:03,835
We've got to get through this together.
- Calm down.

180
00:17:03,989 --> 00:17:08,866
We mustn't panic, mustn't lose our heads.
- It's over, Vince. Can't you see?

181
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:11,515
It'll all come out.
- No. We'll deal with it.

182
00:17:11,669 --> 00:17:12,744
Come on!

183
00:17:19,311 --> 00:17:22,190
This is Filip.
Leave a message after the beep.

184
00:17:22,344 --> 00:17:26,644
Shit, man. What will we do if he
doesn't come? If he's run off?

185
00:17:26,798 --> 00:17:29,218
Filip will come, he must come.

186
00:17:29,409 --> 00:17:32,827
What if it's like last time?
We can't keep on covering up for him.

187
00:17:33,441 --> 00:17:34,977
Guys, take a look at this!

188
00:17:44,615 --> 00:17:47,034
What's this, guys?

189
00:17:48,916 --> 00:17:52,794
What does it mean?
Chris, what does it mean?

190
00:17:58,131 --> 00:18:01,472
Do you know Latin, doctor?
- Pardon?

191
00:18:02,778 --> 00:18:04,813
Do you know Latin?

192
00:18:05,735 --> 00:18:09,229
Yes, I know Latin. Sorry...

193
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:15,757
Then maybe you can tell us
what's written on the wall?

194
00:18:22,170 --> 00:18:24,396
Fatum nos iungebit.

195
00:18:26,431 --> 00:18:30,232
I can read.
But what does it mean?

196
00:18:31,078 --> 00:18:34,572
Fatum nos iungebit,
fate will link us.

197
00:18:36,031 --> 00:18:42,444
Fate. Or death, if you like.
Written in her blood.

198
00:18:43,365 --> 00:18:48,818
Our investigations revealed that the
victim is unlikely to know Latin.

199
00:18:48,972 --> 00:18:51,967
So it's quite possible
someone else wrote that.

200
00:18:52,159 --> 00:18:54,539
But using her finger.

201
00:18:55,193 --> 00:18:59,378
Someone who does
know Latin, doctor.

202
00:18:59,531 --> 00:19:04,254
Fatum nos iungebit is wrong.
- What do you mean, wrong?

203
00:19:04,753 --> 00:19:08,247
The imperfect future of
the verb to join, iungere,

204
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:12,663
isn't iungebit, it's iunget.
It should say fatum nos iunget.

205
00:19:12,817 --> 00:19:16,503
Whoever you're looking for
made a classic mistake in Latin.

206
00:19:16,657 --> 00:19:19,498
But you probably already knew that.

207
00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:23,761
Do you know the expression 'fuck you'?

208
00:19:23,915 --> 00:19:26,641
It's not Latin,
but I'm sure you understand it!

209
00:19:27,677 --> 00:19:29,982
Where's your brother, doctor?

210
00:19:30,135 --> 00:19:33,168
Everyone else is here except him.
We can't get hold of him.

211
00:19:33,361 --> 00:19:35,549
I'm sorry, I've no idea where he is.

212
00:19:35,703 --> 00:19:39,581
He's your half-brother, isn't he?
Same mother, different father?

213
00:19:40,004 --> 00:19:43,037
He and his sister have been
in various children's homes.

214
00:19:43,190 --> 00:19:46,301
They went into care
after our mother died.

215
00:19:46,454 --> 00:19:49,257
Filip wasn't so lucky with his father.
- Obviously.

216
00:19:49,411 --> 00:19:52,368
A serious alcoholic.
He hit his children.

217
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:56,361
You didn't see much of your brother.
Now you're best friends.

218
00:19:56,515 --> 00:20:00,739
Yeah. We've got a lot of lost time
to make up for.

219
00:20:05,961 --> 00:20:10,262
What's that? "Fate will link us. "
Is that meant for us, Chris?

220
00:20:10,415 --> 00:20:14,025
Is that meant for us?
Where the fucking hell is Filip?

221
00:20:14,178 --> 00:20:17,212
Everyone else is here.
- How should I know where he is?

222
00:20:17,404 --> 00:20:19,055
What the fuck is that?

223
00:20:20,744 --> 00:20:23,318
That's from here.
That's a knife from here.

224
00:20:23,471 --> 00:20:25,429
Christ, they'll be blaming us for this!

225
00:20:25,583 --> 00:20:28,962
Where the fuck is Filip?
- Where d'you think?

226
00:20:36,757 --> 00:20:38,869
Can someone tell me what's going on?

227
00:20:39,022 --> 00:20:42,785
Bastard! Sadist!
- What's the matter?

228
00:20:43,784 --> 00:20:45,934
Stop it!
Now is not the time.

229
00:20:46,202 --> 00:20:49,543
Touch me one more time and
you'll be lying there next to her!

230
00:20:49,698 --> 00:20:54,228
Have you got anything to do with this?
- Why would I have?

231
00:20:54,689 --> 00:20:59,028
We'll help if you need a good lawyer.
- But I don't need a lawyer...

232
00:20:59,181 --> 00:21:01,101
Take it easy, Filip.

233
00:21:02,330 --> 00:21:05,249
Were you here last night?
- No, I wasn't here last night.

234
00:21:05,901 --> 00:21:08,666
I was at my parents-in-law's.
Call Vicky and check.

235
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:10,624
Why did it take so long to get here?

236
00:21:10,893 --> 00:21:13,274
I was at a building site
with my father-in-law.

237
00:21:13,428 --> 00:21:17,689
I couldn't just leave. Great to hear
this voice whingeing in your voicemail,

238
00:21:17,882 --> 00:21:20,186
"There's a body in the loft. "
- I don't get it.

239
00:21:20,339 --> 00:21:25,984
And where were you? Before you accuse
everyone else. Where were you?

240
00:21:26,906 --> 00:21:29,594
I was at home last night.
- Any witnesses?

241
00:21:29,747 --> 00:21:33,856
Don't you believe me? No, no witnesses.
Barbara's in Les Arcs with the kids.

242
00:21:34,009 --> 00:21:38,003
If anyone here has got anything
to do with this, he should say so now!

243
00:21:38,195 --> 00:21:40,537
Now's the time! Now!

244
00:21:46,297 --> 00:21:48,678
Thank you, they're lovely.

245
00:21:51,711 --> 00:21:55,167
Filip finally got hitched.
I'll drink to that!

246
00:21:55,359 --> 00:21:58,047
Which one's his father-in-law?
- Him over there.

247
00:21:58,239 --> 00:22:02,040
Ludwig Tyberghein, Mr Concrete.
- Building projects round the world.

248
00:22:02,194 --> 00:22:04,306
Filthy rich and
she's an only child.

249
00:22:04,460 --> 00:22:08,990
Filip is home and dry!
- Let's hope he'll be happy.

250
00:22:09,144 --> 00:22:11,909
She looks like a decent girl, Chris.

251
00:22:12,062 --> 00:22:13,637
Well, well. Look who's here.

252
00:22:14,097 --> 00:22:18,705
Tyberghein's been on a building spree
here since Van Esbroeck became mayor.

253
00:22:18,859 --> 00:22:22,584
Wasn't Van Esbroeck at your opening?
- Yeah, just to show his fancy face.

254
00:22:22,738 --> 00:22:26,117
If it's anything lucrative,
they prefer their own architects.

255
00:22:26,385 --> 00:22:29,995
Oh, so the big boys won't let you play?
They're so mean!

256
00:22:30,148 --> 00:22:34,296
That's not fair.
You draw such nice little houses...

257
00:22:34,449 --> 00:22:36,868
Hey, my nice suit!

258
00:22:53,571 --> 00:22:58,717
Nice, eh? Don't you think?
A fancy wedding like this.

259
00:22:58,870 --> 00:23:03,248
They say money doesn't bring happiness
but that's just to fool the poor.

260
00:23:03,401 --> 00:23:05,206
Isn't it?

261
00:23:08,278 --> 00:23:11,964
Well, guys, you've lost him now.
He's all mine now.

262
00:23:12,156 --> 00:23:14,461
Congratulations, Vicky.
He's a real character!

263
00:23:14,614 --> 00:23:17,609
You do realise that?
- Yes, but I'll tame him.

264
00:23:17,763 --> 00:23:19,069
Right, darling?
- Yeah.

265
00:23:19,222 --> 00:23:21,909
The birdie's in a cage
and I've got the key.

266
00:23:22,063 --> 00:23:24,367
But it is a gold cage, pal!

267
00:23:24,521 --> 00:23:27,209
Can I tell them?
- Yes, of course. Go on.

268
00:23:27,363 --> 00:23:30,550
Filip's going to start working
for my dad next month.

269
00:23:32,316 --> 00:23:34,812
No more lying in the sack all morning,
eh pal?

270
00:23:34,965 --> 00:23:38,152
Gotta go sell houses with daddy!
- I'll get you thrown out!

271
00:23:38,306 --> 00:23:40,226
My security guys will kick your ass!

272
00:23:40,572 --> 00:23:43,106
Come on, let's go and open
some more envelopes.

273
00:23:43,259 --> 00:23:47,253
I'm gonna stay here with my friends.
- OK. Bye.

274
00:23:47,675 --> 00:23:50,209
I've seen enough fancy folk for now!

275
00:24:01,691 --> 00:24:03,495
Filip...

276
00:24:06,914 --> 00:24:09,409
Here's my present.
- Are you serious?

277
00:24:10,138 --> 00:24:13,134
Take good care of it,
there are only five of them.

278
00:24:16,359 --> 00:24:19,968
Accepting the key means
you accept the rules of the loft, guys.

279
00:24:20,122 --> 00:24:23,232
Our wives are here, you idiot!
- The loft is finished. Go and see.

280
00:24:23,386 --> 00:24:26,458
It's a gift from me to all of you.

281
00:24:31,565 --> 00:24:35,520
But you're not like that, right?
If not for now, maybe for later.

282
00:24:35,712 --> 00:24:39,744
Who knows what life holds?
Luc? You?

283
00:24:47,347 --> 00:24:49,727
Just make sure
it doesn't blow up in your face.

284
00:24:51,647 --> 00:24:55,948
Wow, guys, our own loft!
- Just gotta find someone to take there!

285
00:24:56,909 --> 00:25:01,209
There's plenty of choice right here.
Those rich folks attract great pussy!

286
00:25:01,362 --> 00:25:05,241
Look at that young chick there.
With black hair, in a green dress.

287
00:25:05,433 --> 00:25:08,005
I'll gladly show her my etchings.
- She's about 17!

288
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:11,001
She's 18. Keep your hands off her
or you'll regret it!

289
00:25:11,192 --> 00:25:15,110
What? You and her?
- That's Sharon.

290
00:25:15,839 --> 00:25:19,525
Is that Sharon? Skin-and-bones Sharon?
- Yes, that's Sharon.

291
00:25:20,063 --> 00:25:24,210
Is that your little sister?
Wow, she's grown into a real beauty!

292
00:25:24,670 --> 00:25:26,975
Two more summers
and she's ripe for picking!

293
00:25:27,128 --> 00:25:30,277
Although I reckon she's ripe now!
- Marnix! That's enough!

294
00:25:30,469 --> 00:25:32,811
What?
- That's enough.

295
00:25:32,964 --> 00:25:35,499
But pals share their goodies...

296
00:25:37,381 --> 00:25:39,839
I'm thirsty.
Are we gonna have another drink?

297
00:25:40,030 --> 00:25:41,643
A beer.
- A beer.

298
00:25:43,832 --> 00:25:46,520
Don't talk about my sister like that!
- OK.

299
00:25:46,712 --> 00:25:51,050
I mean it. If you ever lay a finger
on her, you're dead! Got it, pal?

300
00:25:51,204 --> 00:25:52,701
Yes, Filip, OK.

301
00:25:59,153 --> 00:26:01,956
I was just joking, man. You're crazy!

302
00:26:07,562 --> 00:26:11,248
Hello, Chris.
- Hello.

303
00:26:11,402 --> 00:26:15,511
I don't know if you remember,
but we met at a gallery opening.

304
00:26:15,664 --> 00:26:20,119
Yes, I know. Ann Marai.
- So you do remember me. That's nice.

305
00:26:20,809 --> 00:26:24,035
I see you work weekends too.
The mayor should be pleased.

306
00:26:25,072 --> 00:26:27,452
The mayor can get stuffed.

307
00:26:30,486 --> 00:26:33,289
I think you're a bit more
than just his assistant.

308
00:26:33,443 --> 00:26:39,241
What do you mean, Mr Psychiatrist?
Have you noticed something?

309
00:26:39,433 --> 00:26:42,159
You don't look very happy.
- Right.

310
00:26:42,928 --> 00:26:46,882
I imagine it's not much fun always
being left on your own at parties.

311
00:26:47,036 --> 00:26:51,107
Later, when you're alone with him,
you'll have all his attention again.

312
00:26:51,260 --> 00:26:58,095
But you're gradually realising that
you'll always be his mistress.

313
00:26:58,249 --> 00:27:01,359
He says
he's going to leave his wife for me.

314
00:27:01,551 --> 00:27:05,506
Is that what he says?
How long has he been saying it?

315
00:27:07,003 --> 00:27:10,497
I told you.
I always fall for the wrong men.

316
00:27:12,379 --> 00:27:17,217
Shall I tell you something?
A little secret, between you and me?

317
00:27:17,524 --> 00:27:21,365
D'you know
what turns our respectable mayor on?

318
00:27:21,518 --> 00:27:27,086
He just loves having my panties
in his pocket at events like this.

319
00:27:28,046 --> 00:27:33,383
That turns him on, seeing me and knowing
I'm not wearing anything under my dress.

320
00:27:33,882 --> 00:27:37,569
Jeez, I don't understand
why you let him treat you like that.

321
00:27:38,375 --> 00:27:41,025
Who says I let him treat me like that?

322
00:27:42,023 --> 00:27:44,673
Maybe it turns me on too.

323
00:27:46,247 --> 00:27:49,703
Maybe telling you is turning me on.

324
00:27:51,623 --> 00:27:54,388
Make sure you don't catch cold.

325
00:27:55,078 --> 00:27:59,955
Chris, sorry...
I don't know why I said that.

326
00:28:00,147 --> 00:28:03,833
Maybe I was testing you or something.
- I don't need to be tested.

327
00:28:05,216 --> 00:28:07,827
Could I talk to you?

328
00:28:07,981 --> 00:28:11,859
Over a cup of coffee. Some place where
we won't be disturbed. Please?

329
00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:37,240
Vincent, that key. I want to use it.
Not for what you think.

330
00:28:37,394 --> 00:28:39,314
I'll give it back as soon as I can.

331
00:28:40,158 --> 00:28:43,844
It's never for what I think, Chris.

332
00:28:49,106 --> 00:28:51,064
Have fun.

333
00:29:01,738 --> 00:29:06,845
Wait. Has everyone still got their key?
- Of course everyone has.

334
00:29:06,999 --> 00:29:10,186
Seriously, let's think logically.
Five keys were made.

335
00:29:10,340 --> 00:29:14,180
You need a code to have another made.
It's in my safe, so we can forget that.

336
00:29:14,334 --> 00:29:18,672
No one's broken in. So just to make
sure. Has everyone still got their key?

337
00:29:18,865 --> 00:29:20,977
D'you think we give our keys to people?

338
00:29:21,130 --> 00:29:23,549
That's against the rules.
Your rules, Vince.

339
00:29:23,742 --> 00:29:28,003
Can everyone get out their key?
- What's the point of that?

340
00:29:28,157 --> 00:29:30,845
A key may've been lost.
Then we can rule that out.

341
00:29:30,999 --> 00:29:32,995
Here. Here's mine.

342
00:29:40,675 --> 00:29:42,864
Where's your key, Chris?

343
00:29:46,703 --> 00:29:50,352
You didn't use your key to get in.
- I haven't got my key with me.

344
00:29:50,582 --> 00:29:53,769
Where is it, Chris?
- I haven't got it on me, OK?

345
00:29:53,923 --> 00:29:56,035
I don't use it every day.
- It's not lost?

346
00:29:56,188 --> 00:29:59,490
It doesn't matter whether
I've got my key with me now or not.

347
00:29:59,644 --> 00:30:02,140
We've only got four.
Where's the fifth?

348
00:30:02,447 --> 00:30:05,251
Christ, Chris,
someone must've used a key to get in.

349
00:30:05,519 --> 00:30:08,975
Oh yeah? How d'you explain
the alarm being switched off?

350
00:30:09,129 --> 00:30:12,277
Whoever got in here
also knew the code to the alarm.

351
00:30:12,584 --> 00:30:17,807
Unless... she let him in, of course.
- And how did she get in then?

352
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:21,723
Whichever way you look at it,
it always comes back to us.

353
00:30:21,877 --> 00:30:25,717
I'd really like to know which one of us
is hiding something here.

354
00:30:28,136 --> 00:30:30,325
What did you say it's called?
- Polyamory.

355
00:30:30,478 --> 00:30:34,241
Multipartnered relationships.
- And your boss is into that?

356
00:30:34,395 --> 00:30:38,504
He's got a wife and a girlfriend
and they know about each other.

357
00:30:38,657 --> 00:30:42,612
He says he loves his wife and he loves
his girlfriend, why should he choose?

358
00:30:42,766 --> 00:30:46,413
And his wife doesn't mind?
What a silly cow!

359
00:30:46,567 --> 00:30:49,869
Sounds like something for us, eh boys?
'Polly-maria'...

360
00:30:50,331 --> 00:30:55,131
Hey, tubby. You can't cope with one
woman, how would you cope with two?

361
00:30:56,974 --> 00:31:00,391
You could look a bit enthusiastic.
- It's your party.

362
00:31:00,583 --> 00:31:03,002
Anyway, I've got to cook.
- Don't be like this.

363
00:31:03,348 --> 00:31:06,457
If you have to invite
your friends round, Chris,

364
00:31:06,612 --> 00:31:12,026
at least be home on time.
- I had to stay at work a bit longer.

365
00:31:13,792 --> 00:31:16,441
What do I have to do
to get some attention?

366
00:31:19,091 --> 00:31:21,395
Get myself admitted to your hospital?

367
00:31:21,856 --> 00:31:23,814
It's not like they're always here!

368
00:31:23,968 --> 00:31:27,500
Come and join us. Do it for me.

369
00:31:28,653 --> 00:31:31,571
I hope tubby doesn't throw up
all over the lounge!

370
00:31:31,725 --> 00:31:34,758
He's drinking whisky like it's water.
Can't his wife see?

371
00:31:34,912 --> 00:31:40,057
Polyamory may be fine, but his wife
eventually had someone catch him at it

372
00:31:40,211 --> 00:31:44,165
and threw him out.
- Your boss is a real sap.

373
00:31:44,319 --> 00:31:49,849
He should've kept his trap shut and
organised things better, eh Vince?

374
00:31:50,002 --> 00:31:51,538
What happened in the end?

375
00:31:51,692 --> 00:31:55,109
He now lives in a tiny flat
with the woman of his dreams.

376
00:31:55,301 --> 00:31:57,566
She's 22, blonde and has false breasts.

377
00:31:57,720 --> 00:32:00,485
Typical...
Why do men like fake breasts?

378
00:32:00,638 --> 00:32:04,709
Women! Always whining about fake tits!

379
00:32:04,901 --> 00:32:08,203
If they look good, they look good.

380
00:32:08,357 --> 00:32:13,579
My mom's got false teeth.
When she laughs, are you gonna say,

381
00:32:13,732 --> 00:32:16,190
"Oh dear, they're false!"

382
00:32:16,344 --> 00:32:19,531
No, people will say that they look good.

383
00:32:19,685 --> 00:32:23,064
You look better than you did.
It's an improvement.

384
00:32:23,256 --> 00:32:26,635
It's always the same with women,
they're always jealous!

385
00:32:27,018 --> 00:32:30,896
Marnix...
- Nothing beats a beautiful chick!

386
00:32:31,050 --> 00:32:33,470
This is a little too high-brow for me...

387
00:32:33,623 --> 00:32:39,037
My IQ's too low for profound philosophy.
- Maybe you should have it enlarged?

388
00:32:39,537 --> 00:32:43,146
And get the corners of your mouth
lifted, so you can smile for once.

389
00:32:46,218 --> 00:32:50,633
Well, Miriam,
I really admire your choice in men.

390
00:32:53,821 --> 00:32:58,083
No, d'you know what? That guy
should've organised things better.

391
00:32:58,237 --> 00:33:01,501
That would've been better.
You've gotta be organised, right?

392
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:05,148
OK then,
how would you organise things?

393
00:33:05,340 --> 00:33:09,718
You have to find some place
where they can't catch you.

394
00:33:10,179 --> 00:33:16,553
That is the key to... that is the key
to time... to stealing time.

395
00:33:16,706 --> 00:33:20,854
Sounds like you've already given it
some thought. Any more strange ideas?

396
00:33:21,046 --> 00:33:25,269
Hey, Vince, Vincey boy.
Stop talking drivel, pal.

397
00:33:25,423 --> 00:33:32,719
Click-click, the key, there's the trick.
The key to the...

398
00:33:34,447 --> 00:33:35,445
Marnix!

399
00:33:36,290 --> 00:33:39,400
Let's go and get some fresh air.
It'll do you good.

400
00:33:39,554 --> 00:33:41,742
Sorry. Sorry, boys.

401
00:33:44,814 --> 00:33:48,270
Don't worry about it. He gets
like this when he's been drinking.

402
00:33:48,424 --> 00:33:51,304
Why haven't I got
someone like you for a husband?

403
00:33:55,835 --> 00:33:58,829
Oops, sorry.
- Don't worry about it.

404
00:33:59,214 --> 00:34:03,783
I felt a bit queasy after that starter.
Thai food...

405
00:34:04,129 --> 00:34:09,505
It's spicy. Can be hard on your nose...
- Yeah, exactly.

406
00:34:17,184 --> 00:34:19,834
We need some more insulin,
this is almost gone.

407
00:34:19,987 --> 00:34:22,944
Luc, is there something
you should tell me?

408
00:34:23,136 --> 00:34:26,477
What should I tell you?
- Are you keeping secrets from me?

409
00:34:27,322 --> 00:34:31,929
Of course not.
- Are you in love with someone else?

410
00:34:32,083 --> 00:34:35,155
You can tell me.
- Why are you asking strange questions?

411
00:34:35,308 --> 00:34:39,226
No, I'm not cheating on you.
- That wasn't what I asked.

412
00:34:39,417 --> 00:34:42,643
I asked if you were in love
with someone else...

413
00:34:47,136 --> 00:34:52,742
Elsie, I may not be as exciting as the
rest but I will always be there for you.

414
00:34:52,934 --> 00:34:56,389
Always. For you and the children.

415
00:34:57,465 --> 00:35:00,998
I don't know
what I would do without you, Luc.

416
00:35:03,686 --> 00:35:06,373
There's a lot I could put up with...

417
00:35:10,904 --> 00:35:14,514
What are you doing?
- We've got to get rid of her.

418
00:35:14,667 --> 00:35:17,816
We can't, Vince.
The handcuffs won't fuckin' open!

419
00:35:18,353 --> 00:35:22,194
Can't you see what's going on?
Someone's trying to set us up!

420
00:35:22,347 --> 00:35:26,532
Who'd want to do that?
- Think. A handcuffed body.

421
00:35:26,686 --> 00:35:29,873
The Latin, the knife,
all in our loft.

422
00:35:30,411 --> 00:35:34,289
Who else knows about our arrangement?
Has anyone ever given the game away?

423
00:35:34,443 --> 00:35:36,247
You, Marnix?
- What? Why me?

424
00:35:36,631 --> 00:35:38,859
Because you were totally hammered maybe?
- No!

425
00:35:39,051 --> 00:35:42,775
I've always kept to the rules.
- Did you reveal the code to the alarm?

426
00:35:42,967 --> 00:35:45,195
Or enter it with someone watching?
- No!

427
00:35:45,348 --> 00:35:48,266
Why are you looking at me?
- What are you trying to say?

428
00:35:48,419 --> 00:35:51,722
Maybe someone wants revenge,
wants it all to come out?

429
00:35:51,876 --> 00:35:53,758
Who'd want revenge?

430
00:35:53,911 --> 00:35:58,519
I don't know. A jealous boyfriend,
a rejected mistress, someone like that.

431
00:36:00,976 --> 00:36:03,588
Is anyone of us in trouble?

432
00:36:36,918 --> 00:36:42,524
I think you're sweet.
- Uh-oh, that sounds like "pathetic".

433
00:36:43,753 --> 00:36:45,442
No.

434
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:49,742
You're one of the good ones.

435
00:36:50,549 --> 00:36:53,736
That's a strange thing to say,
given the circumstances.

436
00:36:53,928 --> 00:36:55,004
I don't know.

437
00:36:58,268 --> 00:37:02,414
Who does this loft belong to?
- A friend.

438
00:37:02,606 --> 00:37:07,214
He's abroad.
- He seems to have been abroad for ages.

439
00:37:11,899 --> 00:37:14,164
I love you, Ann.

440
00:37:14,318 --> 00:37:17,466
You shouldn't say
something like that to me, Chris.

441
00:37:18,388 --> 00:37:21,499
I mean it.
- Yes. And why?

442
00:37:21,921 --> 00:37:24,225
Because you feel you have to say it?

443
00:37:24,378 --> 00:37:27,373
I don't cheat on my wife or
fall in love at the drop of a hat.

444
00:37:27,565 --> 00:37:32,634
I don't want you to be in love with me.
Our rendezvous are exciting.

445
00:37:32,787 --> 00:37:35,936
But real life's not like that.
- I'd like to give it a try.

446
00:37:36,128 --> 00:37:39,085
If you don't shut up,
I'll say something mean.

447
00:37:41,313 --> 00:37:43,731
I'm fed up with all the lies,
all the secrecy.

448
00:37:44,345 --> 00:37:49,645
I want to tell Ellen everything.
And... I'm going to leave her.

449
00:37:55,098 --> 00:37:57,939
You can only be hurt
by people you love.

450
00:37:58,361 --> 00:38:00,550
I'll never hurt you, Ann.

451
00:38:02,316 --> 00:38:05,734
I'm not talking about you.
You don't know me.

452
00:38:06,694 --> 00:38:11,878
Give me the chance to get to know you.
- I'm a whore, Chris! OK?

453
00:38:12,992 --> 00:38:17,253
I sleep with men for money.
That's what I am, a whore!

454
00:38:17,445 --> 00:38:19,519
What did you say?
- Don't worry, doctor.

455
00:38:19,673 --> 00:38:22,822
I won't be sending you a bill
for the past few months.

456
00:38:22,975 --> 00:38:27,160
What did you say?
- Forget it. You don't know half of it.

457
00:38:31,653 --> 00:38:35,569
Is Chris cheating on his wife?
- Eh, I don't think so, officer.

458
00:38:35,838 --> 00:38:39,563
Chris is a devoted husband...
- All your friends are real family men!

459
00:38:39,717 --> 00:38:42,674
You should all open a fuckin' shop!

460
00:38:42,827 --> 00:38:46,590
But you've done a few things
you shouldn't, eh pal?

461
00:38:47,550 --> 00:38:49,777
Why does your wife want a divorce?

462
00:38:49,931 --> 00:38:53,617
I don't know about a divorce...
We've just separated for a while.

463
00:38:53,770 --> 00:38:58,570
Why?
- My wife found something out

464
00:38:58,762 --> 00:39:03,140
that she wasn't very pleased about.
- You cheated on her.

465
00:39:04,254 --> 00:39:06,174
Technically speaking... yes.

466
00:39:07,786 --> 00:39:13,277
And how did she find out?
- The woman that I...

467
00:39:13,431 --> 00:39:16,349
That you cheated on her with.
- Yes. Her.

468
00:39:17,194 --> 00:39:18,998
She'd obviously expected more

469
00:39:19,153 --> 00:39:21,763
and turned up at our place.
The stupid...

470
00:39:21,917 --> 00:39:25,603
The lady in question started
telling my wife all about it...

471
00:39:25,757 --> 00:39:29,942
I hope my wife will forgive me
for my mistake, because I love her.

472
00:39:30,096 --> 00:39:33,935
Cheating is fun, but
getting caught is a bitch, right?

473
00:39:35,011 --> 00:39:39,197
Did you take the woman to the loft?
- No, no, it happened in Düsseldorf.

474
00:39:39,580 --> 00:39:42,576
In Düsseldorf?
- What were you doing there?

475
00:39:43,075 --> 00:39:47,068
There was a trade fair there.
Vince had some VIP tickets

476
00:39:47,221 --> 00:39:51,522
and two were going spare. A couple of
nights at a fancy hotel, away from home.

477
00:39:52,060 --> 00:39:57,244
You were one of the lucky recipients.
- I was one of the lucky recipients...

478
00:39:59,356 --> 00:40:02,620
You don't dare!
100 euro. 200 euro.

479
00:40:02,773 --> 00:40:05,077
She keeps looking at you, man!

480
00:40:05,230 --> 00:40:08,302
Invite her over. You can have her,
I'll have the leftovers.

481
00:40:08,456 --> 00:40:11,528
In your dreams!
- I'm not interested in those girls.

482
00:40:11,758 --> 00:40:14,101
Why not? They're begging for it!

483
00:40:14,370 --> 00:40:16,174
Far too easy!
- Come on, Vince!

484
00:40:16,328 --> 00:40:20,436
I prefer women who are worth the effort,
who are special.

485
00:40:20,591 --> 00:40:24,430
I like discovering unknown islands.
- Look over there.

486
00:40:24,584 --> 00:40:27,080
A whole group of islands!
An atoll, Luc!

487
00:40:27,234 --> 00:40:31,419
Vince, does Barbara know about
these 'discovery trips' of yours?

488
00:40:32,149 --> 00:40:35,413
Why would I want to hurt her with that?
- Hey, take it easy, man.

489
00:40:35,604 --> 00:40:38,907
You've got a key to the loft.
What d'you do there? The washing up?

490
00:40:40,865 --> 00:40:43,975
Well! More Belgians in the hotel!

491
00:40:44,628 --> 00:40:48,199
My name's Anja. I'm waiting for
a colleague from work.

492
00:40:48,352 --> 00:40:51,731
It's expensive here, isn't it?
- Can we buy you a drink?

493
00:40:51,923 --> 00:40:56,224
That'd be nice of you. Can I have
something other than a beer?

494
00:40:56,378 --> 00:40:59,411
What are you drinking?
Is that champagne?

495
00:40:59,642 --> 00:41:02,560
She'll scare off
all the good-looking girls, man!

496
00:41:03,251 --> 00:41:04,710
A glass of champagne.

497
00:41:04,864 --> 00:41:10,047
Ugly girls always have pretty friends.
- What if she's the prettiest one?

498
00:41:11,545 --> 00:41:15,961
Look, look! I don't believe it,
Mr Concrete is here too.

499
00:41:16,115 --> 00:41:18,688
And he's not here with
Mrs Concrete, either.

500
00:41:23,987 --> 00:41:28,863
All guys are the same!
- What wisdom, Anja! I'll drink to that.

501
00:41:29,017 --> 00:41:31,628
You're a weird guy, you know that?

502
00:41:32,972 --> 00:41:37,196
A bottle of champagne, please, and
four glasses for that table over there.

503
00:41:39,154 --> 00:41:43,186
Weren't you at Vicky's wedding?
Filip's friends?

504
00:41:43,801 --> 00:41:45,605
The architect?
- Vincent Stevens.

505
00:41:45,797 --> 00:41:47,678
I designed...
- I've heard of you.

506
00:41:47,909 --> 00:41:51,749
Maybe we should get together.
I can always use an architect.

507
00:41:51,903 --> 00:41:54,360
Great, Mr Tyberghein.
- We've got a big project

508
00:41:54,513 --> 00:41:59,390
in Antwerp, Left Bank.
Apartment blocks, luxury apartments.

509
00:41:59,544 --> 00:42:03,998
Very trendy and all that crap.
It may be right up your street.

510
00:42:04,152 --> 00:42:10,334
But it's still all very hush-hush.
I hope you can be discreet.

511
00:42:10,488 --> 00:42:14,404
It would be a challenge...
- Discretion, Mr Stevens.

512
00:42:15,786 --> 00:42:20,778
That's something I insist on.
Dictum sapienti sat est.

513
00:42:20,932 --> 00:42:24,042
A word to the wise is enough.

514
00:42:24,234 --> 00:42:27,997
Are you a good listener?
- Definitely... definitely.

515
00:42:28,151 --> 00:42:32,375
I'm in software
and I can also be very discreet.

516
00:42:35,754 --> 00:42:38,480
Put everything these people drink
on my bill.

517
00:42:38,634 --> 00:42:41,476
Enjoy the rest of your evening,
gentlemen.

518
00:42:42,128 --> 00:42:43,319
Thank you.

519
00:42:44,662 --> 00:42:45,814
Miss...

520
00:42:47,542 --> 00:42:52,457
Who does that bastard think he is?
Dictum sapienti, my ass!

521
00:42:52,649 --> 00:42:56,143
There, look. Someone else
on a discovery trip!

522
00:43:03,862 --> 00:43:07,317
That's the mayor's whore, Marnix.

523
00:43:21,679 --> 00:43:25,135
Hello, this is Ann Marai.
Messages after the beep.

524
00:43:29,473 --> 00:43:31,624
Who are you calling
at this late hour?

525
00:43:32,737 --> 00:43:35,464
No one. Just listening
to my voicemail. Why?

526
00:43:35,617 --> 00:43:38,574
Listening to your voicemail.
What did it say?

527
00:43:38,920 --> 00:43:41,761
"You're a poor liar, Chris Van Outryve?"

528
00:43:43,451 --> 00:43:46,830
Why d'you say that? Is something up?
- I don't know.

529
00:43:46,983 --> 00:43:49,864
Perhaps that's
what I should be asking you!

530
00:43:55,086 --> 00:43:59,194
Ellen, I...
- I'm going to bed.

531
00:43:59,347 --> 00:44:02,535
Can you turn the lights off?
- Ellen!

532
00:44:05,683 --> 00:44:08,448
Guys' brains are between their legs!

533
00:44:08,602 --> 00:44:11,482
Yeah? There are two things
in women's magazines.

534
00:44:11,674 --> 00:44:15,322
What pigs men are
and how to seduce them.

535
00:44:15,514 --> 00:44:21,005
But why take on a whole pig,
when you only need a tiny bit of one?

536
00:44:30,144 --> 00:44:33,484
Can't leave you alone for five minutes!
- Five minutes?

537
00:44:33,676 --> 00:44:37,324
Sarah, sweetheart, I've been
waiting here for you for an hour!

538
00:44:37,517 --> 00:44:40,973
Fortunately for me,
I found some sponsors!

539
00:44:41,548 --> 00:44:44,927
Aren't you going to introduce me
to your new friends?

540
00:44:47,308 --> 00:44:50,841
Was that the first time you met her?
- Yes, that was the first time.

541
00:44:53,183 --> 00:44:56,869
Sarah Delporte.
- Yes, Sarah.

542
00:44:57,023 --> 00:44:59,519
What happened in Düsseldorf?

543
00:44:59,711 --> 00:45:02,245
What do you want to know?
- Everything.

544
00:45:05,509 --> 00:45:09,541
If they catch us, they'll throw us out.
- You're terrible, Sarah!

545
00:45:09,694 --> 00:45:12,575
You shouldn't have dared me!

546
00:45:14,610 --> 00:45:18,219
There, the swimming pool.
- Shall we go back, Vincent?

547
00:45:18,372 --> 00:45:21,751
Before something happens we'll regret.
- Come on, Luc.

548
00:45:21,905 --> 00:45:26,052
This is really exciting, eh?
- A bit too exciting for me.

549
00:45:32,465 --> 00:45:35,959
Come on, Vincent. Take your clothes off.

550
00:45:37,187 --> 00:45:41,680
You wanted to swim in the nude.
We had a bet, now I want my prize.

551
00:45:42,833 --> 00:45:45,559
My scampi are about to reappear.

552
00:45:46,404 --> 00:45:49,898
What? You haven't seen anything yet.
You're serious?

553
00:46:17,967 --> 00:46:20,847
There.
- What d'you mean, there?

554
00:46:21,922 --> 00:46:24,457
More?
- Yes, more.

555
00:46:30,447 --> 00:46:35,131
Yeah... not bad... for such an old guy!

556
00:46:37,167 --> 00:46:41,582
You like playing games.
- Who's playing games here?

557
00:46:41,736 --> 00:46:43,233
You dared me, so we'd end up here

558
00:46:43,425 --> 00:46:46,536
which is what you wanted all along...
- As if I would...

559
00:46:52,219 --> 00:46:54,062
Come on, your turn. Come on.

560
00:47:09,537 --> 00:47:14,068
Luc, is it still too exciting
or do you feel more relaxed now?

561
00:47:27,162 --> 00:47:29,120
Nice, isn't it?
- Lovely.

562
00:47:31,347 --> 00:47:33,575
Aren't you coming in, Luc?
- I'm fine here.

563
00:47:33,728 --> 00:47:36,301
But I need you, Luc,

564
00:47:36,454 --> 00:47:38,912
because Vincent's going
to try to hit on me

565
00:47:39,104 --> 00:47:41,216
and if you're there, he may not dare.

566
00:47:41,715 --> 00:47:46,514
You're a cheeky minx!
- It's not true, then?

567
00:47:46,707 --> 00:47:49,433
You've been paying me compliments
all evening

568
00:47:49,625 --> 00:47:53,350
and that naughty way you look at me.
Do that look again.

569
00:47:55,308 --> 00:47:58,189
That eye contact that lasts
a bit too long. No, really.

570
00:47:58,457 --> 00:48:03,026
You're very good, Vincent.
- I think so too.

571
00:48:08,172 --> 00:48:10,322
Did you think
I'd given you the go-ahead?

572
00:48:10,476 --> 00:48:15,506
Sorry, Vincent, you disappoint me.
- You really like playing games!

573
00:48:15,660 --> 00:48:19,614
I'll tell you something.
I'm better at it than you are.

574
00:48:26,949 --> 00:48:30,098
Can you feel me?
- Yes.

575
00:48:55,172 --> 00:48:59,510
Marnix? Are you here? Marnix?

576
00:49:00,970 --> 00:49:03,466
I want the key to our room, pal.

577
00:49:05,079 --> 00:49:09,687
Marnix.
- Leave us alone for a bit, Luc.

578
00:49:19,401 --> 00:49:24,778
You're scared. You're running away
from your feelings, aren't you?

579
00:49:27,888 --> 00:49:30,038
I don't want to say goodbye.

580
00:49:31,574 --> 00:49:34,377
I'm sorry it has to
end this way, Sarah...

581
00:49:40,060 --> 00:49:43,132
Are you actually capable
of loving someone?

582
00:49:44,745 --> 00:49:45,858
I'm sorry.

583
00:49:57,147 --> 00:50:01,602
Why are you throwing that away?
- Because it's empty.

584
00:50:04,174 --> 00:50:07,246
You were here last night,
weren't you, pal?

585
00:50:07,400 --> 00:50:11,087
If you were here last night, why don't
you say so? We're your friends.

586
00:50:11,240 --> 00:50:14,811
She was here when I left.
She was still alive then.

587
00:50:14,964 --> 00:50:16,616
Someone came round after I left.

588
00:50:16,769 --> 00:50:20,148
Well, say so then. You're just making
the whole thing worse.

589
00:50:20,340 --> 00:50:21,876
We should go to the police.

590
00:50:22,030 --> 00:50:24,795
We can't sort this out.
- Are you crazy? What do we say?

591
00:50:24,948 --> 00:50:26,484
And to our wives?

592
00:50:27,867 --> 00:50:34,088
Vince has got something to tell you.
- What do you want to tell us, Vincent?

593
00:50:37,582 --> 00:50:39,194
What the fuck?

594
00:50:49,140 --> 00:50:50,406
Go on, answer it.

595
00:50:53,747 --> 00:50:55,360
Hello?

596
00:50:57,319 --> 00:50:58,739
Who is it?

597
00:51:01,696 --> 00:51:03,846
A real estate agent
to see the loft.

598
00:51:04,077 --> 00:51:05,843
The loft is up for sale.
- What?

599
00:51:05,997 --> 00:51:08,530
See, I was right! Fuckin' hell!

600
00:51:09,606 --> 00:51:13,561
How can it be for sale, Chris?
- She's come to see a Sarah Delporte.

601
00:51:14,252 --> 00:51:16,748
Who is Sarah Delporte?

602
00:51:19,244 --> 00:51:22,547
Who is she, guys?
And who put this place up for sale?

603
00:51:26,233 --> 00:51:28,498
She did, or what?

604
00:51:28,651 --> 00:51:32,569
You know her, Marnix.
- What? What are you saying?

605
00:51:33,989 --> 00:51:36,139
That you know her.

606
00:51:36,293 --> 00:51:38,059
So does Luc.

607
00:51:42,514 --> 00:51:44,587
That's Sarah Delporte there.

608
00:51:46,085 --> 00:51:49,732
I swear I've never seen her before.
- You're lying. You do know her.

609
00:51:50,078 --> 00:51:52,689
Why d'you say that?
- We met her in Düsseldorf.

610
00:51:52,843 --> 00:51:55,877
A couple of months ago,
that last evening in the bar.

611
00:51:56,414 --> 00:51:58,449
She was Anja's friend.

612
00:51:59,256 --> 00:52:00,446
Come on!

613
00:52:03,632 --> 00:52:07,511
I was totally pissed, I don't remember.
- I know, Marnix.

614
00:52:07,972 --> 00:52:11,850
But you weren't, eh Luc?
- Is that her?

615
00:52:12,273 --> 00:52:13,271
Goddammit!

616
00:52:13,463 --> 00:52:17,572
Don't be stupid, Luc. You spoke to her.
- How am I supposed to know it's her?

617
00:52:17,725 --> 00:52:21,258
I don't know who that is. You turned
her over, you saw her. I didn't.

618
00:52:22,448 --> 00:52:25,213
Do you know her or not, Luc?
- When you see a body,

619
00:52:25,367 --> 00:52:29,514
you're not gonna think of a girl
you met one evening in a hotel bar.

620
00:52:29,974 --> 00:52:33,508
He's twisting the facts,
that's what he's doing. Don't you see?

621
00:52:34,697 --> 00:52:38,576
You've made a mistake, madam. We don't
know anyone called Sarah Delporte.

622
00:52:40,151 --> 00:52:41,455
Come on, Filip.

623
00:52:48,752 --> 00:52:51,401
Do you know her?
- I can't see, dammit!

624
00:52:51,554 --> 00:52:55,548
Who's that?

625
00:52:57,391 --> 00:53:00,809
Was that what you wanted
to tell us, Vincent?

626
00:53:00,962 --> 00:53:04,648
We were seeing each other, OK?
I brought her here a couple of times.

627
00:53:04,802 --> 00:53:08,873
But I swear on my children's lives,
I've got nothing to do with this.

628
00:53:09,026 --> 00:53:11,676
On your children's lives?
Jesus Christ, man!

629
00:53:11,829 --> 00:53:16,245
Were you here with her last night?
Did you bring her here?

630
00:53:16,398 --> 00:53:18,357
I don't want to say goodbye.

631
00:53:21,198 --> 00:53:24,155
I finished it last night.

632
00:53:27,879 --> 00:53:29,954
Vincent...

633
00:53:35,099 --> 00:53:38,747
She was alive when I left her,
Chris, I swear... Anyway, so what?

634
00:53:38,939 --> 00:53:42,394
That still doesn't explain why someone
here put our loft up for sale!

635
00:54:18,643 --> 00:54:22,636
Are you looking for something
in particular orjust browsing, sir?

636
00:54:24,057 --> 00:54:26,323
Why don't you return my calls?

637
00:54:26,477 --> 00:54:30,009
If you're dumping me,
at least have the guts to tell me.

638
00:54:30,163 --> 00:54:33,964
How can I dump you, Chris? There's
nothing going on between you and me...

639
00:54:34,117 --> 00:54:38,495
Oh, is that what it was? Nothing? OK...

640
00:54:39,878 --> 00:54:42,603
Let's not make this difficult.
You know what I am.

641
00:54:42,757 --> 00:54:47,365
It doesn't matter who or what you are.
It really doesn't, Ann.

642
00:54:48,287 --> 00:54:52,395
How many women
have you taken to that loft of yours?

643
00:54:53,854 --> 00:54:56,735
That loft you share with your friends.

644
00:54:58,808 --> 00:55:01,573
Save your whinging for the next chick
you take there.

645
00:55:01,726 --> 00:55:05,489
Wait! Ann, you know I'm not like that.
You know I'm not.

646
00:55:08,753 --> 00:55:11,595
I've known better liars than you.
- Hold on.

647
00:55:11,748 --> 00:55:15,051
Here. I only need this
if we're gonna go there together.

648
00:55:15,204 --> 00:55:19,274
Keep it.
If you want to see me, let me know.

649
00:55:22,308 --> 00:55:26,686
Chris? What are you doing here?
Are you looking for something for Ellen?

650
00:55:26,839 --> 00:55:31,217
Hi, Elsie.
No, I was here with a colleague.

651
00:55:40,125 --> 00:55:44,234
Does your wife know you share a loft?
- I told you, I don't.

652
00:55:44,388 --> 00:55:47,575
I may have been there once,
when the building opened.

653
00:55:47,728 --> 00:55:51,606
So you have been there! Just now
you said you didn't know where it was.

654
00:55:51,760 --> 00:55:55,369
I've never taken anyone there.
I thought that was what you meant.

655
00:55:55,523 --> 00:55:58,748
Did you know the girl?
- I met her in Düsseldorf.

656
00:55:58,902 --> 00:56:03,280
Did you know he started seeing her then?
- I'd be very surprised if he did.

657
00:56:04,009 --> 00:56:08,693
D'you get jealous when your good friend
Vincent hits on good-looking women?

658
00:56:08,847 --> 00:56:11,919
I'm married. I'm not jealous of him.

659
00:56:12,073 --> 00:56:16,297
I don't mean of him, Mr Seynaeve.
I mean jealous of the women.

660
00:56:18,293 --> 00:56:22,248
What are you saying?
What are you implying?

661
00:56:22,671 --> 00:56:25,973
You've got a nerve,
insinuating that kind of thing!

662
00:56:26,664 --> 00:56:29,928
Why so fierce, Mr Seynaeve?
- Vincent's my best friend,

663
00:56:30,082 --> 00:56:34,575
always has been.
- Your best friend has betrayed you all.

664
00:56:34,767 --> 00:56:38,261
Vincent would never betray his friends.
You're just saying that.

665
00:56:38,991 --> 00:56:39,989
You bastard!

666
00:56:40,372 --> 00:56:42,447
What was that?
- You heard, you bastard!

667
00:56:42,600 --> 00:56:44,558
You accuse me yet hide stuff from us!

668
00:56:44,712 --> 00:56:48,206
Last night I told her our relationship
was over and then I left.

669
00:56:48,359 --> 00:56:50,817
And that's it, man.
- That's it?

670
00:56:51,585 --> 00:56:54,312
You seem to have put
a definite stop to it!

671
00:56:54,465 --> 00:56:57,767
When were you planning
on telling us, Vince?

672
00:57:00,609 --> 00:57:03,680
Put that knife down, Filip.
Don't be stupid!

673
00:57:04,602 --> 00:57:06,752
I don't know what happened after that.

674
00:57:07,521 --> 00:57:09,786
I've got nothing to do with it!
- Let him be.

675
00:57:10,016 --> 00:57:14,164
Maybe I wasn't the only one.
Maybe she was seeing someone else too.

676
00:57:14,778 --> 00:57:18,272
Someone who's trying to pin it on us.
- On you, you jerk!

677
00:57:23,686 --> 00:57:26,950
It looks like
it's your problem now, Vincent.

678
00:57:28,256 --> 00:57:30,060
Can't you see what's happening?

679
00:57:30,252 --> 00:57:33,209
Why see a real estate agent
about a loft that's not hers?

680
00:57:33,363 --> 00:57:36,396
On the day she's found dead in it.
What a coincidence!

681
00:57:36,550 --> 00:57:37,740
Why would she do that?

682
00:57:38,047 --> 00:57:40,582
We can't carry on, guys.
It's all coming out.

683
00:57:41,925 --> 00:57:45,843
So what are you going to do?
Leave me to deal with it on my own?

684
00:57:52,562 --> 00:57:56,786
Vincent? Are you there?
Vince? Open the door, please.

685
00:57:58,552 --> 00:58:01,701
Are you crazy? I'm here with someone.
- Miriam's gone!

686
00:58:05,003 --> 00:58:08,344
What d'you mean, Miriam's gone?
- She's left me.

687
00:58:08,497 --> 00:58:11,608
That girl from Düsseldorf
told her what happened.

688
00:58:11,761 --> 00:58:14,411
You have to help me.
- Does she know about the loft?

689
00:58:14,795 --> 00:58:18,328
What? No. Of course not.
It all happened in Düsseldorf.

690
00:58:18,482 --> 00:58:22,206
You were there, at the pool.
Miriam's gone, Vince.

691
00:58:22,360 --> 00:58:23,666
What do I do now?

692
00:58:24,740 --> 00:58:28,273
I can't live without her.
- You haven't admitted anything?

693
00:58:28,427 --> 00:58:32,996
Rule 1, never admit anything. You hurt
them when you do. They don't understand.

694
00:58:33,149 --> 00:58:37,105
Can't you go and
have a word with her, Vince?

695
00:58:37,259 --> 00:58:43,825
Can't you tell her that I love her,
that that Anja is lying?

696
00:58:43,978 --> 00:58:49,891
She'll believe you, Vince.
- I'll try, OK.

697
00:58:50,775 --> 00:58:53,194
It'll be OK.
- I love her, Vince.

698
00:58:53,425 --> 00:58:59,031
I'll see it's all straightened out.
Shit, I just hope that's all she knows.

699
00:59:06,364 --> 00:59:11,011
Look at what you've got us into.
- Sorry, that wasn't the idea.

700
00:59:11,741 --> 00:59:14,236
Now what?
- We've got to get her out of here.

701
00:59:14,390 --> 00:59:16,733
Remove all traces of what's happened.

702
00:59:16,925 --> 00:59:21,571
We can't just make her disappear.
- It's the only way to get out of this.

703
00:59:22,300 --> 00:59:24,873
Listen to you!
You had a relationship with her

704
00:59:25,027 --> 00:59:28,368
and now she's just evidence
that may ruin your perfect life.

705
00:59:28,521 --> 00:59:32,437
What kind of person are you?
- I don't need lessons from you!

706
00:59:32,591 --> 00:59:35,970
How are you gonna get her off the bed?
Saw her hand off?

707
00:59:36,162 --> 00:59:39,618
Or have you got the keys to the cuffs?
- No, I haven't.

708
00:59:39,772 --> 00:59:42,882
I thought handcuffs
were more your department!

709
00:59:44,571 --> 00:59:48,872
What's that supposed to mean?
- You know very well what I mean.

710
00:59:53,480 --> 00:59:55,016
Help me!

711
00:59:57,358 --> 00:59:59,278
Shut the fuck up!

712
01:00:01,391 --> 01:00:04,347
Shut up!
The slut thinks she can jerk me around!

713
01:00:05,384 --> 01:00:07,303
Help me! Please.
- Shut up!

714
01:00:07,610 --> 01:00:09,300
He's crazy!

715
01:00:10,068 --> 01:00:15,252
He raped me! He raped me!
- It's OK.

716
01:00:15,444 --> 01:00:17,902
Give me the key.
- The bitch wanted to call the cops!

717
01:00:18,324 --> 01:00:21,895
The key!
- The key? Here's the key.

718
01:00:22,279 --> 01:00:23,585
Here's the key.

719
01:00:23,738 --> 01:00:25,735
I didn't want to do things.

720
01:00:26,388 --> 01:00:28,884
He made me do things...
- Shut up!

721
01:00:29,114 --> 01:00:34,029
What? Do you want more money? Eh?
Is that it? Here's your fucking money!

722
01:00:34,644 --> 01:00:36,909
Are you mad?
Have you lost your mind?

723
01:00:37,063 --> 01:00:40,749
She's a whore! D'you know
what it is about whores? D'you know?

724
01:00:40,902 --> 01:00:43,705
You can't rape them! You can't.

725
01:00:45,011 --> 01:00:47,507
Fuck!
- You don't treat a woman like that!

726
01:00:48,122 --> 01:00:49,543
Not any woman!

727
01:00:49,696 --> 01:00:51,501
What is it with you?
- Get off me!

728
01:00:51,654 --> 01:00:55,302
Keep your hands off me!
Just fuckin' look at you!

729
01:00:55,455 --> 01:00:57,683
You're high on coke
and beating women up.

730
01:00:57,837 --> 01:01:01,945
Don't you realise you're putting us
all in danger? D'you realise that?

731
01:01:02,098 --> 01:01:06,054
I want the police.
He hit me. He raped me.

732
01:01:06,975 --> 01:01:09,472
Keep your trap shut
or I'll shut it for you!

733
01:01:09,625 --> 01:01:12,159
You're no fuckin' better
than your old man!

734
01:01:13,081 --> 01:01:19,378
Oh, Chris!
Yeah, Chris was luckier with his daddy!

735
01:01:20,299 --> 01:01:25,099
You, who always wants to help the whole
world, who wants to save everyone.

736
01:01:25,253 --> 01:01:29,554
Where were you
when we were being beaten up?

737
01:01:30,168 --> 01:01:33,087
And our mother pretended
she couldn't hear it.

738
01:01:33,278 --> 01:01:36,696
Safe in your student digs!
- Jesus!

739
01:01:37,348 --> 01:01:41,189
You were never bothered about us.

740
01:01:42,148 --> 01:01:47,217
Never. I had to protect my sister.
We meant nothing to you.

741
01:01:48,100 --> 01:01:50,865
We meant nothing to you, nothing.
- I didn't know.

742
01:01:51,134 --> 01:01:53,438
If I had known...
- What?

743
01:01:53,591 --> 01:01:56,279
What? I'd have taken you
away from there, dammit!

744
01:02:07,607 --> 01:02:10,679
I'm terribly sorry
but we cannot go to the police.

745
01:02:10,833 --> 01:02:13,827
I'll take you to a friend of mine,
he's a doctor.

746
01:02:16,093 --> 01:02:18,780
Vincent, give me
all the money you've got on you.

747
01:02:25,232 --> 01:02:29,072
This is about 700 euros. It's not enough
for what happened to you today

748
01:02:29,456 --> 01:02:31,759
but maybe it makes it easier to forget.

749
01:02:31,913 --> 01:02:34,102
No, he's an animal.
He should be locked up!

750
01:02:34,256 --> 01:02:36,751
I want the police.
- We'll deal with him. I promise.

751
01:02:37,097 --> 01:02:44,086
Wait. Take this. It's worth
a lot of money. Take it. Take it.

752
01:02:46,236 --> 01:02:49,231
See, that's what she wanted... money.

753
01:02:49,385 --> 01:02:52,188
I'll tear you apart
if you don't shut up!

754
01:02:52,687 --> 01:02:56,834
Come on, get your clothes,
we'll go to a doctor.

755
01:02:56,987 --> 01:02:59,484
I don't need your doctor.

756
01:03:09,889 --> 01:03:14,229
You made me do something today
that I'll never forgive you for. Never.

757
01:03:17,186 --> 01:03:22,369
I'll pay you back for the watch.
What's the problem?

758
01:03:27,783 --> 01:03:29,933
Fuck me!
Why didn't we know about this?

759
01:03:30,087 --> 01:03:32,276
When did this happen?
- Two weeks ago.

760
01:03:32,430 --> 01:03:34,426
We agreed to keep it to ourselves.

761
01:03:34,580 --> 01:03:37,230
Because that's what friends do.
- I don't need lessons from you.

762
01:03:37,383 --> 01:03:39,994
Not about friendship.
- But it's why I kept quiet.

763
01:03:40,147 --> 01:03:42,605
I thought this was your doing.
You'd got here

764
01:03:42,797 --> 01:03:45,946
pissed, stoned, worked up...
- Kiss my ass!

765
01:03:46,100 --> 01:03:49,824
It's time you gave up snorting coke!
- It's time you gave up the booze!

766
01:03:49,978 --> 01:03:51,860
That's enough! Just listen to you!

767
01:03:52,052 --> 01:03:54,163
They want to set us against each other!

768
01:03:55,354 --> 01:03:57,811
Someone's trying to destroy us!

769
01:04:00,308 --> 01:04:05,990
There's something I have to tell you
too. Can someone restrain Filip first?

770
01:04:11,866 --> 01:04:14,169
Filip...
- You had that coming, pal.

771
01:04:15,283 --> 01:04:17,395
What are you saying, Luc?

772
01:04:18,547 --> 01:04:21,656
You asked us to be honest,
to put all our cards on the table.

773
01:04:21,811 --> 01:04:25,727
I'm putting all my cards on the table.
- So where are they, Luc?

774
01:04:25,881 --> 01:04:28,146
And where did you do it?

775
01:04:57,291 --> 01:05:00,632
I don't believe this! Fuckin' hell!

776
01:05:23,287 --> 01:05:25,092
Fuckin' hell, Luc!

777
01:05:32,733 --> 01:05:36,803
So you record everything that happens
here, every woman we bring here.

778
01:05:37,034 --> 01:05:40,067
Not always... Sometimes.
- Oh. When is sometimes?

779
01:05:40,221 --> 01:05:43,408
When you like what's on?
- At least I'm not cheating on my wife.

780
01:05:43,562 --> 01:05:45,827
No, you just watch.
- You're sick, you are!

781
01:05:46,288 --> 01:05:50,089
You're sick! You raped a prostitute,
not me. I've got it on DVD!

782
01:05:50,358 --> 01:05:52,853
You're sick.
- Filip, we're in this together.

783
01:05:53,008 --> 01:05:57,461
Remember what we said.
- Where are these recordings, Luc? Here?

784
01:05:57,615 --> 01:06:01,686
I want you to destroy all the DVDs.
The whole lot. Together with us.

785
01:06:01,839 --> 01:06:06,639
Or I swear, I couldn't give a shit
whether this all comes out or not!

786
01:06:06,831 --> 01:06:12,015
So you recorded what happened yesterday.
- No, you didn't say you'd be here.

787
01:06:12,360 --> 01:06:17,890
You broke your own rules. You're
good at that, breaking your own rules.

788
01:06:18,888 --> 01:06:25,416
Now you're scared. Scared I've got DVDs
of everything you've been up to here.

789
01:06:28,910 --> 01:06:32,712
But don't worry, Vince,
I'm your friend.

790
01:06:32,866 --> 01:06:38,932
Your best friend... I'll keep quiet.
I always keep quiet.

791
01:06:39,086 --> 01:06:42,119
I've always known you were a sleazebag!
- Jerk!

792
01:06:42,311 --> 01:06:46,535
You got your rocks off watching us!
- You know nothing about me! Nothing!

793
01:06:46,919 --> 01:06:48,033
Zip!

794
01:06:48,417 --> 01:06:52,218
Did you see anything that could help us?
D'you know what happened?

795
01:06:52,372 --> 01:06:56,558
When people, who are being
cheated on and hurt, find each other,

796
01:06:56,749 --> 01:06:58,477
what do you think happens?

797
01:07:07,155 --> 01:07:09,767
What do you mean?
- What do you think?

798
01:07:17,946 --> 01:07:21,248
What's up, mousey?
- I don't feel like going tomorrow.

799
01:07:21,402 --> 01:07:25,088
What? Don't you want to go skiing?
- Yes, but I don't want to go on my own.

800
01:07:25,241 --> 01:07:30,156
But you're not. The kids are going too.
- You know what I mean.

801
01:07:31,193 --> 01:07:33,804
Can't you come too, darling?

802
01:07:35,532 --> 01:07:39,026
I love you. The rest is irrelevant.

803
01:07:39,180 --> 01:07:43,903
What d'you mean, the rest is irrelevant?
- Everything that's not important.

804
01:07:45,670 --> 01:07:49,126
I'll call you every day.
I promise.

805
01:07:51,890 --> 01:07:56,536
I know. One hour, no longer.
- Do what you want. Don't mind me.

806
01:07:57,343 --> 01:08:00,722
I enjoy every moment
that we are still together.

807
01:08:04,408 --> 01:08:09,477
Have you ever thought what you'd be
losing if you chose the unknown?

808
01:08:15,083 --> 01:08:19,115
Well, well, if it's for charity,
Mrs Concrete's allowed to come too.

809
01:08:19,998 --> 01:08:22,686
Did you hear anything about
that Left Bank project?

810
01:08:22,878 --> 01:08:26,180
I heard they got building permission.
- They didn't call back.

811
01:08:26,334 --> 01:08:28,752
I'm not important enough
for the big boys.

812
01:08:29,905 --> 01:08:31,940
But they don't know me yet.

813
01:08:40,387 --> 01:08:44,880
Ladies...
- This is Vincent Stevens, an architect.

814
01:08:45,034 --> 01:08:48,259
He did the building on Tavernierkaai.
- Oh, was that you?

815
01:08:48,413 --> 01:08:51,830
The design is fantastic, it's wonderful.
Congratulations.

816
01:08:52,023 --> 01:08:53,136
Congratulations.

817
01:08:53,289 --> 01:08:56,323
I was talking to your husband about it
in Düsseldorf.

818
01:08:56,553 --> 01:08:59,472
It's a shame you weren't there
in Düsseldorf...

819
01:08:59,664 --> 01:09:03,619
You told me about
your Left Bank project, Mr Tyberghein.

820
01:09:04,118 --> 01:09:06,806
You were going to call me about it.

821
01:09:06,998 --> 01:09:11,145
We're working on it.
We've applied for building permission...

822
01:09:11,299 --> 01:09:15,561
We're just waiting and hoping.
- Fantastic!

823
01:09:15,715 --> 01:09:20,361
Are you a gambling man, Mr Mayor?
- Do you like taking risks, Mr Stevens?

824
01:09:20,745 --> 01:09:23,740
Depends on the stake and
what the others have got to lose.

825
01:09:23,894 --> 01:09:27,580
How did you put it?
Dictum sapienti sat est? Was thatit?

826
01:09:28,155 --> 01:09:31,726
Ladies, let me wish you
good luck at the tables.

827
01:09:31,881 --> 01:09:35,375
You're obviously already
lucky in love!

828
01:09:36,603 --> 01:09:37,602
Gentlemen...

829
01:09:40,942 --> 01:09:44,437
Make sure you save some for
my alimony, tubby. Don't lose it all.

830
01:09:44,974 --> 01:09:50,004
What are you doing here, Miriam?
- Can't I go out for a change?

831
01:09:50,350 --> 01:09:52,692
Please, I really want to come back.

832
01:09:52,846 --> 01:09:55,995
I did something stupid.
I know that. I was drunk.

833
01:09:56,187 --> 01:10:00,296
It didn't mean anything.
- I don't understand that about guys.

834
01:10:00,488 --> 01:10:04,711
If it doesn't mean anything, why do it?
That's not very nice for the girls.

835
01:10:04,981 --> 01:10:07,975
I swear I'll change.
- Change? Into what? A frog?

836
01:10:08,128 --> 01:10:10,471
Or the doormat you already are?

837
01:10:10,740 --> 01:10:14,004
How would you feel if I said
I feel like messing around tonight?

838
01:10:14,311 --> 01:10:18,727
Maybe I already have, with one
of your friends, to get even.

839
01:10:18,881 --> 01:10:20,417
With Chris. Or...

840
01:10:20,724 --> 01:10:24,832
with Vincent,
who you sent to have a word with me.

841
01:10:25,217 --> 01:10:28,019
"Oh Miriam. He's really suffering!"

842
01:10:29,632 --> 01:10:34,700
You're on a roll! You've won!
But half is mine, remember!

843
01:10:55,359 --> 01:10:57,241
Twenty-one!

844
01:10:58,854 --> 01:11:01,195
Did you give Sharon tickets?
- That hurts!

845
01:11:01,349 --> 01:11:03,960
I won't give her any
but you do behind my back.

846
01:11:04,114 --> 01:11:07,531
So? You're not her father.
- Have you seen what she looks like?

847
01:11:07,685 --> 01:11:11,256
Like a whore!
- I thought whores turned you on?

848
01:11:11,410 --> 01:11:13,791
What?
- Leave her alone, Filip, let her be.

849
01:11:13,983 --> 01:11:17,977
She's having fun and I'm going
to do the same. I'm winning here.

850
01:11:18,936 --> 01:11:22,008
You'll need it, given the amount
of stuff you put up your nose!

851
01:11:22,162 --> 01:11:25,310
The pot calling the kettle black.
Make sure you save enough!

852
01:11:25,694 --> 01:11:27,767
You may need it sooner than me.

853
01:11:27,922 --> 01:11:31,992
D'you know what you should do? Start
divorce proceedings, you fuckin' bitch!

854
01:11:32,184 --> 01:11:34,487
Divorce proceedings, Filip? So what?

855
01:11:34,642 --> 01:11:38,136
You get nothing as long as
we don't have kids, jackass! Nothing!

856
01:11:38,289 --> 01:11:42,321
Here. Have a go at roulette,
maybe you can make your fortune!

857
01:12:28,591 --> 01:12:35,158
Ann?

858
01:12:42,761 --> 01:12:47,599
We need to talk, doctor.
- What about?

859
01:12:48,405 --> 01:12:54,165
Your friend, the architect...
He's playing a very dangerous game.

860
01:12:54,434 --> 01:12:58,197
He should be extremely careful.
Can you tell him

861
01:12:58,350 --> 01:13:02,036
to be very careful?

862
01:13:02,190 --> 01:13:04,878
I thought
this was supposed to be about Ann.

863
01:13:13,326 --> 01:13:14,939
Sorry.

864
01:13:18,011 --> 01:13:20,314
I want you to stop seeing Ann.

865
01:13:21,658 --> 01:13:25,191
Why would I do that?
- I love her.

866
01:13:27,034 --> 01:13:30,759
Then you're not the only one.
- You, you pay her...

867
01:13:33,715 --> 01:13:38,093
I want you to let her go.
- You know it's her choice.

868
01:13:38,247 --> 01:13:41,280
We should just be happy
with what she gives us.

869
01:13:41,434 --> 01:13:44,506
Sorry, but I've never paid her.
- That's true.

870
01:13:44,698 --> 01:13:50,342
You haven't paid her. Not you...
- Be quiet, Alex.

871
01:13:52,378 --> 01:13:56,524
Don't forget to give that message
to your friend, doctor.

872
01:13:59,827 --> 01:14:02,015
What did he mean?
"Not you... "

873
01:14:03,359 --> 01:14:06,431
I don't want to love you, Chris.
- What did he mean?

874
01:14:06,585 --> 01:14:09,043
What did he mean
when he said I didn't pay you?

875
01:14:09,196 --> 01:14:11,845
You're the only one who can hurt me.

876
01:14:12,729 --> 01:14:15,378
Tell me it's not true, Ann!

877
01:14:17,606 --> 01:14:21,906
The first time was paid for.
I was only a whore the first time.

878
01:14:22,099 --> 01:14:27,321
All the other times, that was me.
- So who paid then?

879
01:14:56,158 --> 01:15:00,036
Excuse me. Sharon, come with me, now!
- Filip, I can look after myself.

880
01:15:00,344 --> 01:15:02,455
Come with me!
- Leave me alone.

881
01:15:02,609 --> 01:15:06,103
Hey, pal! Are you deaf?
- Butt out!

882
01:15:06,295 --> 01:15:09,712
Come on, Sharon.
- She doesn't want to, you prick!

883
01:15:11,825 --> 01:15:15,358
Prick? Is that what it says here?

884
01:15:21,577 --> 01:15:24,534
It's not, is it, you asshole?
- Stop it!

885
01:15:25,917 --> 01:15:28,605
It's not there, is it? Fuck you!

886
01:15:34,518 --> 01:15:37,245
OK, OK, let go, let go.
- Get him out of here.

887
01:15:37,743 --> 01:15:41,353
Now. I never want to see you again.
Do you hear?

888
01:15:41,545 --> 01:15:44,118
Never again. You jerk!

889
01:15:56,482 --> 01:15:58,710
It's alright.

890
01:16:10,344 --> 01:16:15,797
Who's that girl?
- Sarah, it's not what you think.

891
01:16:15,950 --> 01:16:19,137
What do I think?
- She's a friend's sister.

892
01:16:19,329 --> 01:16:21,711
She's just been assaulted,
there was a fight.

893
01:16:24,052 --> 01:16:26,011
Are there any more?
- Don't be silly.

894
01:16:26,164 --> 01:16:31,233
She's a best friend's sister, she's
still a kid. What do you take me for?

895
01:16:31,541 --> 01:16:33,384
I'm not sure any more.

896
01:16:33,537 --> 01:16:36,263
I can't be with you for too long.
My wife is here too.

897
01:16:36,456 --> 01:16:40,487
Do you love me?
- You know I love you in my own way.

898
01:16:40,641 --> 01:16:45,556
Your own way. And if you have to choose?
- It's not that simple, Sarah.

899
01:16:45,709 --> 01:16:50,893
We'll go to the loft tomorrow. Barbara's
going away, we can talk about this then.

900
01:16:51,047 --> 01:16:54,810
Shall I make choosing easier for you?
- How?

901
01:16:56,768 --> 01:16:58,995
Get it over and done with.

902
01:17:08,250 --> 01:17:09,786
What are you going to do?

903
01:17:10,323 --> 01:17:27,487
Sarah!

904
01:17:30,022 --> 01:17:34,245
Oh, sorry.
Did I hurt you?

905
01:17:34,668 --> 01:17:37,048
Don't do it. You'll regret it.

906
01:18:10,993 --> 01:18:14,257
Jesus! They know!

907
01:18:15,947 --> 01:18:19,595
It's our wives.
Our wives have set us up.

908
01:18:19,748 --> 01:18:21,131
Why, Vincent?

909
01:18:23,089 --> 01:18:25,814
Because they found out about the loft.

910
01:18:26,007 --> 01:18:29,540
Because they found out,
because it's all come out.

911
01:18:31,652 --> 01:18:34,032
Why did you do it?

912
01:18:34,839 --> 01:18:36,068
Why what?

913
01:18:37,757 --> 01:18:40,983
I told you.
- Why us? We're your friends.

914
01:18:42,172 --> 01:18:43,709
We're your friends!

915
01:18:48,470 --> 01:18:51,273
It's our wives. They found out.

916
01:18:51,427 --> 01:18:55,997
No, Vince, it's not our wives. It's
your friends. Your friends found out.

917
01:18:58,530 --> 01:19:01,334
Your friends found out.

918
01:19:08,514 --> 01:19:11,855
What's going on guys?
- You still don't get it, eh?

919
01:19:20,764 --> 01:19:22,492
Come on, take his clothes off.

920
01:19:24,105 --> 01:19:27,330
What are you doing to me?
- Did you have to do that to her?

921
01:19:27,522 --> 01:19:31,246
Shut up! I just did what we agreed!
- Not like that, with all that blood!

922
01:19:31,400 --> 01:19:35,431
Isn't that Latin on the wall a bit
over the top? Will the cops fall for it?

923
01:19:35,586 --> 01:19:39,118
You should've done it yourself then!
- Stop it, guys. Later!

924
01:19:41,153 --> 01:19:43,342
What's going on?
- Be quiet.

925
01:19:43,495 --> 01:19:48,717
You killed her.
- We didn't kill her.

926
01:19:50,100 --> 01:19:52,251
We just found her.

927
01:19:57,511 --> 01:19:59,777
What?
- We were here earlier today, Vince.

928
01:20:01,274 --> 01:20:04,193
This morning. Without you.

929
01:20:24,697 --> 01:20:27,155
Jesus, man.
- First I thought she was asleep.

930
01:20:27,309 --> 01:20:28,691
And Vincent knows her?

931
01:20:28,883 --> 01:20:31,609
Yes, she left him a farewell letter.

932
01:20:32,493 --> 01:20:34,911
We're going to have to
call the police, guys.

933
01:20:35,142 --> 01:20:40,018
The public prosecutor comes in the
case of suicide. It'll all come out.

934
01:20:41,439 --> 01:20:43,474
"See you in your next life... "

935
01:20:43,935 --> 01:20:48,389
Hey, guys, can't we find out
where she lives and leave her there?

936
01:20:52,421 --> 01:20:54,802
Come on, we've got to help Vincent.

937
01:20:56,146 --> 01:20:58,334
He's a pal.
- Where is he, anyway?

938
01:20:58,489 --> 01:21:01,061
It's his fucking problem.

939
01:21:02,252 --> 01:21:05,016
I didn't call him.
- What? You didn't call him?

940
01:21:05,170 --> 01:21:10,162
Why not, Luc?
- I've got something to show you, guys.

941
01:21:13,618 --> 01:21:17,995
You've been filming us?
Are you crazy?

942
01:21:18,686 --> 01:21:22,219
You can beat me to a pulp later,
if you want. We haven't got time now.

943
01:21:23,947 --> 01:21:27,595
You need to see something that'll change
your outlook on the situation.

944
01:21:27,748 --> 01:21:29,207
What d'you mean?

945
01:21:29,399 --> 01:21:33,931
We don't have to take the rap for
a situation Vincent has got us into.

946
01:21:41,726 --> 01:21:44,528
Vincent hasn't always been
such a good friend.

947
01:21:48,254 --> 01:21:50,672
Hey, what's that?

948
01:21:52,822 --> 01:21:54,397
What is that?

949
01:21:54,897 --> 01:21:58,813
They came here late at night, that
evening he went to have a word with her.

950
01:21:59,043 --> 01:22:02,768
She was drunk, Marnix,
and he took advantage of the fact.

951
01:22:04,995 --> 01:22:08,336
I don't believe it.

952
01:22:08,490 --> 01:22:10,141
Can't you have a word with her?

953
01:22:10,294 --> 01:22:13,942
Maybe I already have. To get even.
With Vincent...

954
01:22:14,095 --> 01:22:16,477
who you sent to have a word with me.

955
01:22:17,283 --> 01:22:18,358
It'll be OK.

956
01:22:45,122 --> 01:22:50,152
Is that your little sister?
Wow, she's grown into a real beauty.

957
01:22:59,137 --> 01:23:01,288
How long?
- It doesn't matter, Filip...

958
01:23:01,480 --> 01:23:05,358
It started right after your wedding.
They met here regularly.

959
01:23:06,241 --> 01:23:09,467
He was her first.
She was a virgin.

960
01:23:30,777 --> 01:23:31,776
Nice, eh?

961
01:23:33,389 --> 01:23:35,002
You don't know me.

962
01:23:41,338 --> 01:23:42,912
But you're not like that.

963
01:23:43,603 --> 01:23:47,635
The first time was paid for.
- So who paid then?

964
01:23:51,053 --> 01:23:54,317
He paid her to get you here, Chris.

965
01:23:56,275 --> 01:23:59,654
You can only be hurt
by people you love.

966
01:24:02,918 --> 01:24:05,452
He used her
like he used everyone else.

967
01:24:21,963 --> 01:24:23,806
I'll kill him! I mean it!

968
01:24:23,998 --> 01:24:26,494
No, I mean it.
- Calm down, pal.

969
01:24:26,648 --> 01:24:29,336
If we stick to what we agreed,
we may stand a chance.

970
01:24:29,490 --> 01:24:31,601
He mustn't know what we're going to do.

971
01:24:31,793 --> 01:24:34,175
We have to pull together.
- We've no choice.

972
01:24:34,597 --> 01:24:39,243
The police will question us.
- We mustn't admit to sharing the loft.

973
01:24:39,435 --> 01:24:43,083
They'll try to play us off against
each other and we mustn't let them.

974
01:24:43,275 --> 01:24:45,156
Jeez, you sound just like Vincent!

975
01:24:45,310 --> 01:24:48,958
If all this comes out,
our lives are completely screwed too.

976
01:24:52,951 --> 01:24:53,950
Chris?

977
01:24:56,522 --> 01:25:00,708
OK. I'm in. On one condition.

978
01:25:00,862 --> 01:25:03,818
I want to be sure.
Sure he was here last night.

979
01:25:03,972 --> 01:25:09,041
I want to hear him say it. I'll give you
a sign, break a glass or something.

980
01:25:09,232 --> 01:25:13,571
But nothing happens
until we're 100% certain.

981
01:25:13,763 --> 01:25:17,027
So? What do we do now?

982
01:25:17,258 --> 01:25:20,099
We've got two hours
to provide ourselves with alibis

983
01:25:20,252 --> 01:25:22,173
and set everything up.
- I'll do it.

984
01:25:22,327 --> 01:25:25,744
You don't have to, Filip.
- I'll manage.

985
01:25:26,895 --> 01:25:28,893
Go on, make sure people see you.

986
01:25:29,046 --> 01:25:31,273
Where's that farewell letter?
- I've got it.

987
01:25:31,657 --> 01:25:36,841
You knew about this the whole time. The
whole time you watched and kept quiet.

988
01:25:37,032 --> 01:25:39,375
You sleazy voyeur!

989
01:25:39,529 --> 01:25:44,175
You're no better than him! Pervert!
- Be glad you now know.

990
01:25:44,329 --> 01:25:46,632
No, Luc, I'm not glad I know.

991
01:26:13,589 --> 01:26:14,855
Swallow, man.

992
01:26:19,770 --> 01:26:27,911
What the hell has happened?

993
01:26:43,425 --> 01:26:46,996
Is that your little sister?
She's grown into a real beauty!

994
01:26:49,414 --> 01:26:51,641
How long?
- It doesn't matter, Filip.

995
01:27:24,857 --> 01:27:28,505
Did you have to do that to her?
- I just did what we agreed.

996
01:27:28,658 --> 01:27:31,077
Not with all that blood!
- Not like that, Filip.

997
01:27:31,269 --> 01:27:34,187
That Latin on the walls.
Will the cops fall for it?

998
01:27:36,222 --> 01:27:41,906
You staged it all. The whole thing.
It's all a set-up.

999
01:27:43,250 --> 01:27:47,588
You set me up.
You fuckin' bastards!

1000
01:27:48,472 --> 01:27:52,197
My own pals.

1001
01:27:59,415 --> 01:28:02,027
Why did you do it, Vincent?

1002
01:28:03,332 --> 01:28:10,244
Fucking hypocrites.
You're all liars and cheats.

1003
01:28:10,398 --> 01:28:13,930
Why?
In God's name, why, Vincent?

1004
01:28:14,544 --> 01:28:20,381
Because I could, Chris.
Because it never means anything.

1005
01:28:20,995 --> 01:28:23,607
Because I'm above that!

1006
01:28:24,682 --> 01:28:27,677
I'm above that!

1007
01:28:38,198 --> 01:28:41,769
Am I gonna die?
- No, Vincent, you're not gonna die.

1008
01:28:41,961 --> 01:28:46,339
She enticed you here, drugged you,
then killed herself next to you.

1009
01:28:46,531 --> 01:28:51,331
But you will survive.
Because we're pals.

1010
01:29:02,735 --> 01:29:06,920
They set us up. Me and Sarah.
It was all staged.

1011
01:29:07,074 --> 01:29:08,763
A strange story!
- It's true.

1012
01:29:08,917 --> 01:29:13,295
I'd like to believe you, Mr Stevens,
but what we need are facts,

1013
01:29:13,448 --> 01:29:16,520
specifics, proof, facts.

1014
01:29:16,674 --> 01:29:21,205
Fact: we only found your fingerprints
in the loft. And Sarah Delporte's.

1015
01:29:24,277 --> 01:29:26,696
But they wiped the place clean!

1016
01:29:26,849 --> 01:29:31,995
Fact: you both had traces of sleeping
pills and alcohol in your blood.

1017
01:29:32,263 --> 01:29:36,833
And the DVDs of your performances
in bed. An impressive collection!

1018
01:29:37,025 --> 01:29:40,711
Luc recorded those.
I didn't know about them, no one did.

1019
01:29:40,904 --> 01:29:43,898
Shame they're all of you
and none of your friends.

1020
01:29:44,052 --> 01:29:47,700
None of Marnix's wife,
Filip's sister, no one.

1021
01:29:49,313 --> 01:29:53,153
What are we gonna do about this?
- Why didn't you tie her to the bed?

1022
01:29:53,345 --> 01:29:55,111
Was that so hard?
- She was dead!

1023
01:29:55,303 --> 01:29:57,876
That's no reason to cut her up!
- She killed herself.

1024
01:29:58,068 --> 01:29:59,680
I just made it more dramatic.

1025
01:29:59,834 --> 01:30:02,637
I hope your improvisation
doesn't cause problems.

1026
01:30:02,829 --> 01:30:08,358
Whatever he tells the cops, we keep mum.
- Luc's right. That wasn't necessary.

1027
01:30:15,193 --> 01:30:17,920
I hope we don't regret this.

1028
01:30:20,223 --> 01:30:23,718
You're questioning them,
put pressure on them!

1029
01:30:23,871 --> 01:30:26,790
Marnix will confess. Luc too maybe.
- We have.

1030
01:30:27,673 --> 01:30:30,245
There's no reason
to assume they're lying.

1031
01:30:30,399 --> 01:30:34,124
And they've got something you haven't.
An alibi.

1032
01:30:34,278 --> 01:30:36,658
Not for this morning!
- Yes.

1033
01:30:37,619 --> 01:30:40,652
Luc Seynaeve and Chris Van Outryve
were seen in a bar

1034
01:30:40,806 --> 01:30:43,916
and Marnix Laureys was at work.
- They can't have been!

1035
01:30:44,070 --> 01:30:48,331
We were together for at least an hour.
What about Filip? Where is he?

1036
01:30:48,485 --> 01:30:51,902
Filip's just come forward.
With his father-in-law.

1037
01:30:52,172 --> 01:30:55,935
What's Tyberghein doing here?
- He said Filip's been with him all day.

1038
01:30:56,088 --> 01:31:00,696
But Filip got to the loft after us.
- It's a watertight alibi, Mr Stevens.

1039
01:31:00,850 --> 01:31:03,960
Of course Tyberghein would say that.
I saw him with another woman.

1040
01:31:04,114 --> 01:31:07,339
Filip knew that and that
I'd put pressure on Tyberghein to...

1041
01:31:07,493 --> 01:31:10,718
Oh, so you're blackmailing
Ludwig Tyberghein too?

1042
01:31:10,872 --> 01:31:14,711
They're all cheats, all bad guys?

1043
01:31:14,903 --> 01:31:17,630
When are you going to tell us
what really happened?

1044
01:31:17,822 --> 01:31:21,508
Which we know anyway!
You murdered Sarah Delporte!

1045
01:31:21,700 --> 01:31:24,618
Murdered her? That's not true,
I didn't murder her!

1046
01:31:25,156 --> 01:31:29,533
Are you crazy?
I didn't murder her!

1047
01:31:43,818 --> 01:31:47,120
You can go, Mr Van Outryve.
Thank you for your cooperation.

1048
01:31:47,274 --> 01:31:50,499
We had to check your friend's story.
- Yes, of course.

1049
01:31:57,142 --> 01:32:00,176
There's one thing
that still baffles me, doctor.

1050
01:32:02,518 --> 01:32:06,089
Why does Vincent
continue to accuse his friends?

1051
01:32:07,164 --> 01:32:10,121
I've got no idea.
I don't get it either.

1052
01:32:10,275 --> 01:32:13,384
Could he be trying
to hide something else?

1053
01:32:13,577 --> 01:32:15,420
What do you mean?

1054
01:32:17,647 --> 01:32:20,681
That he murdered her.

1055
01:32:20,834 --> 01:32:25,481
Your colleague said it was suicide.
- That's what it looked like.

1056
01:32:25,634 --> 01:32:28,514
The autopsy showed
the sleeping pills didn't kill her.

1057
01:32:28,668 --> 01:32:31,855
Her wrist was slashed
but she didn't do it herself.

1058
01:32:32,853 --> 01:32:36,002
We didn't find
any hesitation cuts, doctor.

1059
01:32:36,155 --> 01:32:39,419
A person's first cuts to their arm
when slashing their wrist.

1060
01:32:41,647 --> 01:32:43,835
She hasn't got any.

1061
01:32:49,096 --> 01:32:54,394
Vincent wouldn't do something like that.
- His fingerprints are on the knife.

1062
01:32:58,926 --> 01:33:02,113
And we found no farewell letter.

1063
01:33:07,527 --> 01:33:09,600
Is something wrong, Mr Van Outryve?

1064
01:34:14,417 --> 01:34:17,374
Her wrist was slashed
but she didn't do it herself.

1065
01:34:17,528 --> 01:34:22,021
His fingerprints are on the knife.
We found no farewell letter.

1066
01:34:22,212 --> 01:34:24,939
Where is that farewell letter?
- I've got it.

1067
01:35:10,480 --> 01:35:14,781
You startled me!
Hi, Chris.

1068
01:35:15,280 --> 01:35:17,699
Is meeting here a good idea?

1069
01:35:19,657 --> 01:35:23,075
I think we've got a problem, Luc.

1070
01:35:23,497 --> 01:35:27,875
I think we were too thorough
in removing all traces.

1071
01:35:28,028 --> 01:35:32,021
What d'you mean?
- Where is Sarah's farewell letter?

1072
01:35:36,130 --> 01:35:39,855
You put it in your pocket.
- I thought so but it's gone.

1073
01:35:40,815 --> 01:35:45,077
When did you pinch it out of my pocket?
When someone rang the bell?

1074
01:35:47,074 --> 01:35:49,493
The real estate agent.
- I don't follow.

1075
01:35:49,647 --> 01:35:53,832
I'm sorry you've lost your letter
but it's nothing to do with me.

1076
01:35:53,985 --> 01:35:57,096
I phoned the agency
to ask who put our loft up for sale.

1077
01:35:57,249 --> 01:36:00,513
All they could give me was this number.

1078
01:36:06,312 --> 01:36:08,500
Yes, I phoned them.

1079
01:36:09,921 --> 01:36:15,565
I thought maybe, that way...
- Tell me it's not fuckin' true, Luc!

1080
01:36:17,486 --> 01:36:18,752
You didn't phone!

1081
01:36:24,781 --> 01:36:29,581
It's over, Chris. We made it.
We don't need to worry any more.

1082
01:36:30,310 --> 01:36:32,423
Why d'you take the letter
out of my pocket?

1083
01:36:39,411 --> 01:36:41,485
The only real proof of her suicide.

1084
01:37:12,972 --> 01:37:15,545
Maybe because
she didn't write it herself?

1085
01:37:15,698 --> 01:37:17,657
Could this be your handwriting?

1086
01:37:19,231 --> 01:37:22,380
Vincent deceived every single one of us.

1087
01:37:22,572 --> 01:37:25,567
You saw those images, Chris.
- Yes, I saw them.

1088
01:37:25,720 --> 01:37:29,790
Those images that made us so angry
we went along with your stupid plan.

1089
01:37:29,944 --> 01:37:32,479
What are you up to, Luc?
What are you up to?

1090
01:37:32,632 --> 01:37:36,241
What happened here last night?
What did you do to that girl?

1091
01:37:37,509 --> 01:37:42,577
Is it because she came between you
and Vincent? Was she in your way?

1092
01:37:42,769 --> 01:37:46,417
No, she wasn't in the way.
She wasn't.

1093
01:37:48,760 --> 01:37:51,102
Vincent was.

1094
01:37:56,977 --> 01:38:00,126
Are you in love with someone else, Luc?

1095
01:38:16,521 --> 01:38:20,477
Sarah! Hold on! Sarah!

1096
01:38:23,472 --> 01:38:29,692
Forget him, forget Vincent. He's much
better at those games than you.

1097
01:38:29,884 --> 01:38:34,646
He's hurting you, using you.
- And you had to come and tell me?

1098
01:38:34,799 --> 01:38:39,522
Why?
- I would never hurt you.

1099
01:38:39,676 --> 01:38:41,404
If you were to give me a chance...

1100
01:38:47,394 --> 01:38:48,892
What did you say?

1101
01:38:52,770 --> 01:38:54,844
I would never hurt you.

1102
01:38:55,650 --> 01:38:56,841
Never.

1103
01:38:59,375 --> 01:39:02,792
No, Luc, I know you'd never hurt me.

1104
01:39:03,522 --> 01:39:09,166
D'you know why? Because I could never
feel anything for you. Understand?

1105
01:39:09,320 --> 01:39:10,817
Never.

1106
01:39:14,043 --> 01:39:17,576
Maybe in another life,
but not in this one.

1107
01:39:39,079 --> 01:39:40,615
You were here last night?

1108
01:39:43,687 --> 01:39:47,527
I knew Vincent would see her.
Barbara was in France.

1109
01:39:47,680 --> 01:39:51,367
I'm sorry it has to end this way, Sarah.

1110
01:39:54,823 --> 01:39:57,318
I waited until he left.

1111
01:39:58,394 --> 01:40:02,655
She was surprised when she saw me
standing there. She was crying.

1112
01:40:06,189 --> 01:40:08,991
She said I was right about Vincent.

1113
01:40:17,286 --> 01:40:20,972
Consoling people,
that's all I'm good for.

1114
01:40:22,892 --> 01:40:27,615
You gave her those pills?
- The pills were designed to mislead.

1115
01:40:35,256 --> 01:40:37,791
Something's wrong.
What's happening to me?

1116
01:40:38,137 --> 01:40:41,477
I need some air. I don't feel well.
- It's OK, it's OK.

1117
01:40:57,682 --> 01:41:02,750
I gave her an overdose of insulin. It
works immediately and leaves no trace.

1118
01:41:02,904 --> 01:41:08,279
Jesus Christ, Luc.
- I did it for love, Chris. For love.

1119
01:41:08,625 --> 01:41:11,543
It was painful, loving her.

1120
01:41:23,946 --> 01:41:26,480
And you don't mind
Vincent taking the rap?

1121
01:41:26,634 --> 01:41:28,899
Vincent is a bastard.

1122
01:41:29,054 --> 01:41:32,931
He used us.
It was time someone used him.

1123
01:41:34,045 --> 01:41:36,579
Vincent is going to
take the rap for murder.

1124
01:41:38,883 --> 01:41:42,455
Sarah wasn't dead
when we left Filip with her.

1125
01:41:44,451 --> 01:41:46,793
She must've been.
- No.

1126
01:41:53,474 --> 01:41:55,894
You're lying, Chris.
- No.

1127
01:42:01,078 --> 01:42:05,301
I knew I shouldn't have left Filip
with her. What your brother did is sick!

1128
01:42:06,415 --> 01:42:07,414
Bastard! Sadist!

1129
01:42:07,913 --> 01:42:11,023
Sick!
- You're sick, Luc.

1130
01:42:15,938 --> 01:42:20,046
So if I understand correctly,
your brother murdered her.

1131
01:42:25,768 --> 01:42:31,950
Go home, Chris.
Luc'll clear up the mess, as usual.

1132
01:42:33,064 --> 01:42:37,979
You don't have to clean anything up.
It's over, it's all over.

1133
01:42:46,887 --> 01:42:49,230
Could you open the window, Chris?

1134
01:42:52,302 --> 01:42:55,834
Go on. Hurry up.
- Come on, Luc.

1135
01:42:55,988 --> 01:42:57,217
Shut up!

1136
01:42:58,868 --> 01:43:00,019
Down there.

1137
01:43:02,170 --> 01:43:04,320
What are you going to do?
- Shut up!

1138
01:43:04,474 --> 01:43:08,237
Going to kill me too?
What d'you want me to do, Luc?

1139
01:43:09,274 --> 01:43:11,885
Do you want me to jump?
- Go on.

1140
01:43:13,229 --> 01:43:14,841
Stop it, Luc!

1141
01:43:17,376 --> 01:43:20,947
Jesus!
- I don't want to hurt you. I swear.

1142
01:43:24,249 --> 01:43:27,014
I phoned them before I came in, Luc.

1143
01:43:27,283 --> 01:43:30,085
They're on their way here.
I told them everything.

1144
01:43:30,278 --> 01:43:32,774
You're lying. You're bluffing.
I know you.

1145
01:43:32,927 --> 01:43:34,885
I thought I knew you too, Luc.

1146
01:43:36,921 --> 01:43:42,374
And Sarah's letter?
You want it to go down with me?

1147
01:43:45,676 --> 01:43:50,054
Give me that letter. Give it here.
I won't ask you again.

1148
01:44:31,755 --> 01:44:34,865
It's over, Luc. Come on, it's over.

1149
01:44:35,479 --> 01:44:41,585
It's all over. Come on, Luc.
Come on, Luc.

1150
01:44:42,698 --> 01:44:47,459
Chris, tell Elsie and the kids
that I really loved them.

1151
01:44:47,613 --> 01:44:49,417
Will you do that?
- Don't, Luc.

1152
01:44:49,609 --> 01:44:53,949
Do it for Elsie, please.
- No, don't, Luc. Don't do it.

1153
01:44:54,102 --> 01:44:55,331
Luc!

1154
01:45:51,701 --> 01:45:54,965
No way, they've never met before.
It's obvious.

1155
01:45:55,156 --> 01:45:58,766
They're a couple.
- No, look how he's looking at her.

1156
01:45:58,958 --> 01:46:01,531
They're married.
- They're not! No way!

1157
01:46:01,684 --> 01:46:04,256
You can see they're having an affair.
- How can you see?

1158
01:46:04,411 --> 01:46:08,020
From the way he's showing off
and how she's holding her head.

1159
01:46:08,174 --> 01:46:11,207
They're having an affair.
- Have an affair or be square!

1160
01:46:11,361 --> 01:46:14,817
Says he who came round blubbering
and begging me to take him back.

1161
01:46:15,354 --> 01:46:18,234
Cheating is fun,
but getting caught is a bitch.

1162
01:46:18,388 --> 01:46:20,768
Don't start, tubby!
- She's a fine one to talk.

1163
01:46:21,076 --> 01:46:24,916
Right, I'm off.
- All your drivel scares people away.

1164
01:46:25,069 --> 01:46:29,100
I really have to go. The kids are coming
this weekend, I've got a lot to do.

1165
01:46:29,255 --> 01:46:31,136
Are you leaving me here with my wife?

1166
01:46:31,290 --> 01:46:34,938
How about another drink?
- We'll have lots more together, Marnix.

1167
01:46:55,442 --> 01:46:56,901
Chris?

1168
01:47:01,816 --> 01:47:02,969
Hello, Ann.

1169
01:47:03,429 --> 01:47:06,616
Long time no see.
- Yeah.

1170
01:47:09,688 --> 01:47:12,761
I've still got a key
I should give back to you.

1171
01:47:12,952 --> 01:47:16,562
I don't think it fits the lock any more.
Vincent lives there now.

1172
01:47:16,754 --> 01:47:19,595
It's the only thing
his wife allowed him to keep.

1173
01:47:21,822 --> 01:47:26,008
How's your brother?
- His case is heard next month.

1174
01:47:26,162 --> 01:47:27,890
We'll see.

1175
01:47:29,771 --> 01:47:32,574
And you? Everything alright?
- Yes.

1176
01:47:32,728 --> 01:47:35,338
For the most part.
- For the most part...

1177
01:47:40,715 --> 01:47:44,248
I made things difficult for you.
I'm sorry... honestly.

1178
01:47:47,972 --> 01:47:51,505
You can only be hurt
by people you love.

1179
01:47:52,042 --> 01:47:56,036
I learned that from you.
- I'm not sure I still believe in that.

1180
01:47:56,228 --> 01:48:00,374
You miss out on a lot if you do.

1181
01:48:03,485 --> 01:48:04,560
I've changed.

1182
01:48:07,287 --> 01:48:10,089
I heard you've even changed yourjob.

1183
01:48:10,436 --> 01:48:14,198
So you follow what I do, a bit.
- A bit.

1184
01:48:18,115 --> 01:48:24,105
Would you like to follow me a bit
for a cup of coffee or something?

1185
01:48:27,983 --> 01:48:29,596
I've changed too, Ann.

1186
01:48:35,202 --> 01:48:36,661
OK.

1187
01:48:43,036 --> 01:48:44,456
But...

1188
01:48:46,760 --> 01:48:48,757
I still drink coffee.
