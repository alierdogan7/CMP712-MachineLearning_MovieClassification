Steven had the sick mother.

better, and that's when he dumped me.

- Well, just wait. You'll see.

Hello. Do you fellas know what you want?

175

Yes, we do. We would like
to have Caroline wait on us -

176
00:14:59,552 --> 00:15:02,638
if you don't mind - because,
well, we're gonna tip you both.

any parties lately, Caroline?

- Well, I tell you, I know you.

Well, you know. It's going.

How much can we get one of

248

you know, of getting one.

Yeah.

- He don't ride the motorcycle no more.

He slid on a dead squirrel
goin' around a turn over by Frogtown.

334

- Demolished the bike.
- Jesus!

- He was in here last night.
- He got drunk as a dog down the street.

He tried to run through the Lowry Hill
Tunnel, but passed out cos of the fumes.

337
00:31:44,765 --> 00:31:49,895
So they brought him in here. He was
in the bathroom throwin' up all night.

00:31:50,020 --> 00:31:53,941
- Gee, I'm really sorry I missed that.
- Yeah, only Bobby, huh?

00:31:57,361 --> 00:31:59,488
So, Caroline, those two guys, you know,

340
00:31:59,613 --> 00:32:03,451
the ones that were bothering with
the machine the other night last week?

341
00:32:03,576 --> 00:32:07,079
- Yeah?
- Jim seen one of 'em over at St Vincent's.

342
00:32:07,204 --> 00:32:11,333
I went down there to see my cousin Lucy.
She had that thing with her wrist.

343
00:32:11,459 --> 00:32:14,670
Yeah, they had to operate.
Anyway, I see him out in the hallway.

344
00:32:14,795 --> 00:32:18,632
Man, was he worked!
His face was a mess.

345
00:32:18,757 --> 00:32:23,596
Black eyes, bumps, bruises.
Looked like he was hit by a dump truck.

346
00:32:23,721 --> 00:32:26,307
I gotta pick up Lucy on Tuesday.

347
00:32:26,432 --> 00:32:28,225
Come here.

348
00:32:28,350 --> 00:32:30,853
You've been following me home?

349
00:32:30,978 --> 00:32:32,938
How do you know where I live?

350
00:32:33,439 --> 00:32:35,691
Huh? Have you?

351
00:32:36,567 --> 00:32:38,611
Well? Have you?

352
00:32:43,282 --> 00:32:45,326
How's your hand?

353
00:32:49,205 --> 00:32:51,248
Thank you.

354
00:32:51,999 --> 00:32:54,043
I know.

355
00:32:57,129 --> 00:32:59,924
That's the scaredest
I've ever been in my whole life.

356
00:33:00,049 --> 00:33:03,552
I just get squirrels in my stomach
thinking about it.

357
00:33:07,098 --> 00:33:10,810
I guess I don't have to worry
about you telling anybody, huh?

358
00:33:12,103 --> 00:33:14,980
It's kind of a real awkward thing
for a girl.

359
00:33:18,692 --> 00:33:20,945
Well...

360
00:33:21,070 --> 00:33:23,114
Don't take this the wrong way,

361
00:33:24,365 --> 00:33:26,408
but thank you.

362
00:33:33,415 --> 00:33:36,043
I follow you home.

363
00:33:37,419 --> 00:33:39,839
You follow me home?

364
00:33:39,964 --> 00:33:41,966
I...

365
00:33:42,091 --> 00:33:44,009
What?

366
00:33:45,302 --> 00:33:47,388
I wasn't finished.

367
00:33:48,556 --> 00:33:50,599
Finish.

368
00:33:53,185 --> 00:33:56,063
I follow you home when you walk

369
00:33:56,188 --> 00:34:01,527
to... make sure you're... safe.

370
00:34:02,778 --> 00:34:05,281
I've never seen you.

371
00:34:06,657 --> 00:34:08,701
Well, I stay pretty far behind.

372
00:34:11,829 --> 00:34:13,873
- I'm sorry.
- Well...

373
00:34:15,458 --> 00:34:17,793
I mean, don't be sorry. I just...

374
00:34:17,918 --> 00:34:19,712
I wasn't finished.

375
00:34:22,173 --> 00:34:23,549
Finish.

376
00:34:25,968 --> 00:34:29,555
I'm sorry that... I was late...

377
00:34:32,057 --> 00:34:34,226
that night.

378
00:34:36,061 --> 00:34:38,856
I don't think I ever heard you speak,
and when you do,

379
00:34:38,981 --> 00:34:42,610
you apologise to me
for saving me against...

380
00:34:42,735 --> 00:34:45,446
God knows what could have happened.

381
00:34:45,571 --> 00:34:49,617
Why should I be surprised? My life is like
watching the Three Stooges in Spanish.

382
00:34:49,742 --> 00:34:52,953
- Either I'm being dumped or attacked.
<i>- (banging)</i>

383
00:34:53,078 --> 00:34:55,122
Don't hit the machine!

384
00:34:58,709 --> 00:35:01,670
I'm sorry. I don't even know
what I'm saying any more.

385
00:35:01,796 --> 00:35:04,507
I'll talk to you about this later.

386
00:35:04,632 --> 00:35:06,675
And I brought your coat back.

387
00:35:14,350 --> 00:35:16,268

You sure you're all right
to come back to work, hon?

397
00:35:45,172 --> 00:35:47,758
Been looking a little puffy these days.

398
00:35:47,883 --> 00:35:50,803
You sure it was the flu
and not somethin' else?

399
00:35:50,928 --> 00:35:53,097
I'm all right.

400
00:35:53,222 --> 00:35:55,266
Just checking.

401
00:35:56,517 --> 00:35:58,561
What do you think about Adam?

402
00:36:00,020 --> 00:36:02,064
I think he's very weird.

403
00:36:04,733 --> 00:36:06,777
I wonder what he thinks about.

404
00:36:07,862 --> 00:36:13,033
I don't think Adam actually thinks. We're
talkin' about a man who hasn't spoken.

405
00:36:13,868 --> 00:36:18,164
- So?
- So? You don't find that a little weird?

406
00:36:19,832 --> 00:36:21,876
Look at him.

407
00:36:24,837 --> 00:36:28,424
He looks like a tumour sitting over there.
And his hair. Oh, God!

408
00:36:28,549 --> 00:36:31,010
It just bothers me so much.

409
00:36:32,219 --> 00:36:35,723
You know, Lottie says
that he has ape parts in him,

410
00:36:35,848 --> 00:36:38,100
or somethin' like that, I don't know.

411
00:36:38,225 --> 00:36:40,936
Oh, my God. Lottie.

412
00:36:41,937 --> 00:36:44,857
- What a story!
- Well, whatever.

413
00:36:46,859 --> 00:36:48,903
Too bad, though.

414
00:36:49,862 --> 00:36:51,906
He is kinda cute.

415
00:36:54,241 --> 00:36:57,745
I'd do him. If he just wasn't so dumb.

416
00:37:05,002 --> 00:37:07,671
So what are you doin' for Christmas?

417
00:37:08,547 --> 00:37:10,508
Uh...

418
00:37:10,633 --> 00:37:14,095
The usual. Grandparents coming over,

419
00:37:14,220 --> 00:37:18,432
sitting in front of the TV,
looking at the stupid tree,

420
00:37:20,059 --> 00:37:23,979
giving me ten dollars,
asking me where my boyfriend is.

421
00:37:24,939 --> 00:37:27,066
Oh, hon.

422
00:37:27,191 --> 00:37:32,238
You know, it's all right to feel shitty
this time of year. Everybody does.

423
00:37:32,363 --> 00:37:36,742
It's, like, this is life, and when
you go through it long enough,

424
00:37:36,867 --> 00:37:41,122
you know what the flavour is,
and it sure ain't vanilla.

425
00:37:43,874 --> 00:37:46,085
<i># Yeah, ah-ha</i>

426
00:37:46,210 --> 00:37:48,587
<i># Yeah, ah-ha, ah-ha</i>

427
00:37:48,712 --> 00:37:50,422
<i># Bad, bad boys</i>

428
00:37:50,548 --> 00:37:53,676
Why don't you come over for Christmas?
My dad's always saying

429
00:37:53,801 --> 00:37:58,222
"What's wrong with Caroline?
She misses us or what? Or she hates us."

430
00:37:59,890 --> 00:38:01,934
We'll see.

431
00:38:03,102 --> 00:38:07,231
We'll see, huh? We'll see. You know,
I knew you were gonna say that.

432
00:38:07,356 --> 00:38:10,818
Just forget the whole thing.
You know, just forget it.

433
00:38:12,278 --> 00:38:17,199
You got a problem. You really gotta learn
to follow through with things.

434
00:38:17,324 --> 00:38:20,161
I mean, you never finish
anything you start.

435
00:38:21,412 --> 00:38:24,206
- I finish.
- Oh, yeah?

436
00:38:24,331 --> 00:38:26,375
Did you finish beauty school?

437
00:38:27,585 --> 00:38:30,463
We got our practical exam in two weeks.

438
00:38:30,588 --> 00:38:34,717
Yeah, and what about the flower shop?
What happened to the opening?

439
00:38:34,842 --> 00:38:36,886
- Mm-hm.
- Mm-hm.

440
00:38:37,845 --> 00:38:41,474
You know what, Caroline?
I'm gonna give you your first lesson.

441
00:38:41,599 --> 00:38:43,642
Why don't you finish this for me?

442
00:38:46,187 --> 00:38:48,230
Bitch.

443
00:38:53,903 --> 00:38:55,946
Wench.

444
00:38:56,405 --> 00:38:58,449
Slut.

445
00:39:03,954 --> 00:39:05,998
Douchebag.

446
00:39:11,295 --> 00:39:14,507
You better go do your sugars
before I sic Jim on you.

447
00:39:14,632 --> 00:39:16,675
Jim!

448
00:39:17,218 --> 00:39:19,929
Jim! Caroline is screwin' up again!

449
00:39:22,973 --> 00:39:24,809
Jim!

450
00:39:47,414 --> 00:39:49,458
Hi.

451
00:39:53,712 --> 00:39:57,341
You can always measure your tips
by your sugar jars.

452
00:39:57,466 --> 00:40:02,346
Come 3am, I see empty sugar jars,
I know I've got good tips.

453
00:40:06,851 --> 00:40:08,894
- You like hockey?
- Hm?

454
00:40:12,731 --> 00:40:14,775
- Ever been to a game?
- No.

455
00:40:15,860 --> 00:40:18,320
Maybe we could go to a game sometime.

456
00:40:20,823 --> 00:40:22,867
You took my bandage off.

457
00:40:25,411 --> 00:40:27,580
It's OK.

458
00:40:27,705 --> 00:40:29,748
It's OK, it's OK.

459
00:40:34,128 --> 00:40:36,172
Bye.

If you look up long enough,
you'll see a shooting star.

465
00:42:11,642 --> 00:42:14,478
But they're not really stars.
They're meteors.

466
00:42:14,603 --> 00:42:17,314
- Really?
- Falling to the earth.

- <i>(Caroline)</i> All right.

Good dog. What's her name?

477
00:43:09,408 --> 00:43:11,869
I don't know. He never told me.

478
00:43:14,622 --> 00:43:17,541
I don't mean to be rude to you
in your own place or anything,

479
00:43:17,666 --> 00:43:20,336

No, I... No.

482
00:43:32,098 --> 00:43:34,141
You read all these books?

483
00:43:35,851 --> 00:43:37,895
I don't sleep very well.

484
00:43:40,940 --> 00:43:44,318

This is from New Year's Eve. Did you take
this from behind the counter at work?

487
00:44:09,510 --> 00:44:11,554
I better get going.

488
00:44:13,722 --> 00:44:15,766

I brought you some cookies. I made them.

00:47:44,058 --> 00:47:46,102
Can I come in?

523
00:47:56,779 --> 00:48:01,283
- Great weather. What do you think?
- Would you like some ice cream?

524
00:48:01,408 --> 00:48:03,661
Big on the ice cream, aren't you?

525
00:48:03,786 --> 00:48:05,830
No, thanks.

526
00:48:13,838 --> 00:48:17,550
Well, I guess the cookies
are a little on the sugary side.

527
00:48:21,679 --> 00:48:25,141
So, you were all alone for Christmas.

528
00:48:25,266 --> 00:48:30,062
I should have stopped over yesterday.
I should have invited you over.

529
00:48:30,187 --> 00:48:34,191
But... I guess you were already there.

530
00:48:36,569 --> 00:48:40,197
Thank you for the tree. It's so beautiful.

531
00:48:40,656 --> 00:48:43,451
It really made my day
that you remembered.

532
00:48:47,413 --> 00:48:50,082

Do you want me to go?

- No.
- OK, then I'll stay.

I'm not even gonna ask
how you got into our house.

535
00:49:10,686 --> 00:49:13,647
- Do you like music, Caroline?
- Mm-hm.

536
00:49:21,113 --> 00:49:24,325
I never heard you say my name before.
It sounded nice.

537
00:49:27,203 --> 00:49:30,790

Caroline? Caroline?

00:49:32,291 --> 00:49:33,417
Sure.

539
00:49:48,182 --> 00:49:50,226
Wow.

540
00:49:53,354 --> 00:49:55,397
They look really old.

541
00:49:56,440 --> 00:49:58,484
They're magic.

542
00:49:58,859 --> 00:50:02,488
They're not magic!
What kind of magic do they do?

543
00:50:04,406 --> 00:50:08,244
In the orphanage
Mother Camilla used to play them for me.

544
00:50:08,369 --> 00:50:12,915
I used to sit in the sunlight
near the window in her office,

545
00:50:13,040 --> 00:50:15,084
and I'd fall asleep to them.

546
00:50:16,168 --> 00:50:18,629
She gave them to me when I left.

547
00:50:21,132 --> 00:50:27,513
Whenever my life doesn't agree with me,
I lie down and I play these records and...

548
00:50:27,638 --> 00:50:29,682
the rain stops falling.

549
00:50:32,810 --> 00:50:34,895

00:50:35,020 --> 00:50:36,355

Mother Camilla.

She...

554
00:51:22,860 --> 00:51:25,821
She's the one
who told me about my heart.

555

What about your heart?

556
00:51:31,118 --> 00:51:34,330
I was... I was a very sick baby.

557
00:51:35,581 --> 00:51:37,625
My heart was very weak.

558
00:51:40,044 --> 00:51:42,505
My mother, she died when I was born.

559
00:51:44,715 --> 00:51:47,885
She died in the jungle,
where she and my father were living.

560
00:51:48,010 --> 00:51:50,221
In the jungle?

561
00:51:50,346 --> 00:51:52,807
My father was a great adventurer.

562
00:51:59,271 --> 00:52:04,318
One day the great king
of the silver baboons

563
00:52:04,443 --> 00:52:09,198
came down from his peak
high on the mountaintops of Kilimanjaro

564
00:52:09,323 --> 00:52:14,662
and caught my father stealing his treasure
from a deep, dark cave at the very bottom,

565
00:52:14,787 --> 00:52:18,916
where magic rubies trickled down
from the top of the mountain.

566
00:52:22,002 --> 00:52:25,089
After a terrible battle
with the baboon king,

567
00:52:26,424 --> 00:52:29,093
my father was wounded and left to die.

568
00:52:31,429 --> 00:52:35,433
When the great king later learned that
my father needed the enchanted rubies

569
00:52:35,558 --> 00:52:38,018
to heal his son with the dying heart,

570
00:52:39,520 --> 00:52:43,691
he was so overwhelmed with guilt
and shame at what he had done

571
00:52:43,816 --> 00:52:49,655
that he took his own beating heart
right from his mighty baboon chest

572
00:52:49,780 --> 00:52:52,533
and placed it in mine.

573
00:52:54,994 --> 00:52:57,496
Mother Camilla told you all this?

574
00:53:00,791 --> 00:53:02,835
You believe her?

575
00:53:06,756 --> 00:53:08,799
And you tell this to people?

576
00:53:13,095 --> 00:53:16,766
Oh, no. It's a nice story.

577
00:53:22,646 --> 00:53:24,690

578
00:53:39,705 --> 00:53:43,459

00:53:52,802 --> 00:53:54,845
How'd you like me to cut your hair?

581
00:54:18,077 --> 00:54:20,121
It's OK. No one's home.

582
00:54:25,292 --> 00:54:27,753
Mind if I ask who cuts this thing?

583
00:54:28,671 --> 00:54:31,549
- I do.
- I see.

584
00:54:32,716 --> 00:54:36,053
- Mind if I ask something else?
- Ouch.

585
00:54:36,178 --> 00:54:38,222
Sorry.

586
00:54:41,225 --> 00:54:46,522
Did you ever think of doing anything else
with your life besides bus boy?

587
00:54:46,647 --> 00:54:50,359
I mean, you must have had
an education at the orphanage.

588
00:54:52,069 --> 00:54:55,197
I'm not very good with people.

589
00:54:55,322 --> 00:54:57,658
Don't let people stand in your way.

590
00:54:57,783 --> 00:55:00,661

591
00:55:01,912 --> 00:55:04,540
Well, maybe not like you.

592
00:55:04,665 --> 00:55:07,918
I don't know
if I've ever met anyone like you.

593
00:55:15,134 --> 00:55:18,679

I was four years old.

594
00:55:20,306 --> 00:55:22,308
And?

595
00:55:22,433 --> 00:55:28,981
I wasn't allowed any physical contact or...
even allowed to go out in public.

596
00:55:30,900 --> 00:55:33,110
Why?

597
00:55:33,235 --> 00:55:35,738
My health was still poor.

598
00:55:35,863 --> 00:55:38,908
Cos of the risk of infection.

599
00:55:42,244 --> 00:55:46,874
People were so used to staying away
from me that they always stayed away.

600
00:55:49,752 --> 00:55:51,796
I never got close to people.

601
00:55:54,632 --> 00:55:58,135
Jeez. That's gotta be hard on a kid.

602
00:55:59,261 --> 00:56:03,641
Not being held
or being allowed to hold anyone.

603
00:56:10,022 --> 00:56:12,066
What does your father do?

604
00:56:15,069 --> 00:56:16,987

MTC between Minneapolis and St Paul.

He's a real good guy.
You should meet him sometime.

610
00:56:35,339 --> 00:56:39,802
He was on <i>Candid Camera.</i> They locked
him in a closet. He was great about it.

certainly not the last.

01:05:48,309 --> 01:05:50,644
He's a lot smarter than people think.

689
01:05:50,770 --> 01:05:52,813
He reads a lot. Got a lot of books.

He's like a kid, but it's nice.

He thinks he's got a baboon's heart.

You see, Caroline? You see?
I told you this man had ape parts in him.

696
01:06:18,672 --> 01:06:21,926
- I told you!
- He doesn't have ape parts in him.

697
01:06:22,051 --> 01:06:25,679
It's just a story a nun at that orphanage
told a scared little boy

698
01:06:25,805 --> 01:06:29,809
who didn't know why he was so...
He's got some kind of heart problem.

But Adam? You know, you don't have to
sell yourself short either, you know.

- What?

Oh, my God. Caroline, are you OK?

707
01:07:08,431 --> 01:07:13,185
Yeah. Someone stopped them.
It was Adam. He saved me.

Why didn't you tell me this?
Why didn't you come to me?

Well, I kind of told Nick that
you would double with Ronnie.

720

the whole thing, OK? Just forget it, OK?

Well...

724
01:08:04,069 --> 01:08:06,238
Well, go anyway, OK? Just go, Caroline.

When was the last time
we went dancing, huh?

turn out to be the glass-slipper man,

Excuse me? What did you say?

784
01:14:04,388 --> 01:14:06,849
We know he has a congenital defect.

785
01:14:06,974 --> 01:14:11,729
And we do favour,
at some point, a transplant.

786
01:14:11,854 --> 01:14:15,608
It's been left untreated for far too long.

787
01:14:15,733 --> 01:14:20,321
He should remain stable
until a proper donor is available.

788
01:14:20,446 --> 01:14:22,406

789
01:14:22,531 --> 01:14:24,575
That we don't know.

790
01:14:26,744 --> 01:14:30,873
He's sedated now,
but he became very upset before,

791
01:14:30,998 --> 01:14:34,585
when we were talking about going in
to relieve the pressure on his heart.

792
01:14:34,710 --> 01:14:38,923
It took two orderlies, two nurses
and myself just to hold him down.

793
01:14:39,048 --> 01:14:41,759
We were surprised
that didn't kill him right there,

what with all the trauma he's experienced.

795
01:14:44,553 --> 01:14:47,723
However, that's also
a very good sign of hope,

796
01:14:47,848 --> 01:14:50,226
that he's more than strong enough

797
01:14:50,351 --> 01:14:54,855
and he can go on living for quite some
time with treatment for what he's got.

- Number five and number seven.
- Thank you.

the paperwork out of the way.

make a disaster area out of my hair, hm?

856
01:20:02,037 --> 01:20:04,081
I was...

857
01:20:04,999 --> 01:20:07,877
I was wondering if you think about me.

858
01:20:08,669 --> 01:20:10,880
Of course I think about you.

859
01:20:12,631 --> 01:20:14,717
I wasn't finished.

860
01:20:16,302 --> 01:20:17,803
Finish.

861
01:20:19,847 --> 01:20:22,725
I was wondering if you think about me...

862
01:20:25,269 --> 01:20:27,646
half as much as I think about you.

863
01:20:48,626 --> 01:20:52,421
I, uh... have to tell you something.

864
01:20:57,218 --> 01:20:59,261
It might make you angry.

865
01:21:00,262 --> 01:21:02,306
Look at me.

866
01:21:06,519 --> 01:21:08,979
I watch you sleep sometimes.

867
01:21:10,981 --> 01:21:14,777
The tree - it wasn't the first time
I was in your room.

868
01:21:17,446 --> 01:21:19,490
Or the last.

869
01:21:21,867 --> 01:21:24,245
You come into my room?

870
01:21:27,415 --> 01:21:29,458
The basement under the porch.

871
01:21:32,294 --> 01:21:34,338
To watch me sleep?

872
01:21:35,965 --> 01:21:37,341
Why?

873
01:21:39,927 --> 01:21:41,971
You have peace.

874
01:21:43,305 --> 01:21:45,349
I don't.

875
01:21:46,892 --> 01:21:49,562
My sleep, it's always the same dream.

876
01:21:50,771 --> 01:21:53,357
The jungle.

877
01:21:53,482 --> 01:21:58,154
Dreary, twisted limbs. Strangling vines.

878
01:22:00,239 --> 01:22:02,283
And rain.

879
01:22:03,033 --> 01:22:05,077
Always the rain.

880
01:22:08,998 --> 01:22:11,876
I feel suffocated.

881
01:22:14,211 --> 01:22:16,255
Despair.

882
01:22:16,964 --> 01:22:19,425
Despair of just trying to survive.

883
01:22:21,260 --> 01:22:23,304
Despair and no peace.

884
01:22:25,806 --> 01:22:29,351
I'm... afraid if they take away my heart,

885
01:22:31,687 --> 01:22:34,148
I won't be able to love you the same.

886
01:22:36,400 --> 01:22:38,444
You are my peace.

887
01:22:41,530 --> 01:22:43,574
Oh, my God.

888
01:22:44,366 --> 01:22:50,122
You love with your mind and your soul,
not actually with your heart.

889
01:22:50,247 --> 01:22:52,083
It's just a saying.

890
01:22:57,254 --> 01:23:02,259
Why does it hurt so much here when...
you're not with me?

Come here. You're so beautiful.

930
01:25:44,255 --> 01:25:46,298
You get this.

931
01:25:47,425 --> 01:25:49,468
You get this.

932
01:25:58,477 --> 01:26:00,521
And you get this.

933
01:26:08,320 --> 01:26:10,364
Go get your coat.

934
01:26:11,407 --> 01:26:14,410
- Where are we going?
- It's a surprise.

01:26:18,914 --> 01:26:22,126
- What's that?
- It's a present for you.

936

- For me?
- Don't open it.

937
01:26:26,672 --> 01:26:29,759
It's a surprise.
We can open it later together.

938
01:26:30,384 --> 01:26:33,679
You got... you got me
a present on your birthday?

939
01:26:43,105 --> 01:26:45,983
- I have fallen...
- Did you hurt yourself?

940
01:26:47,610 --> 01:26:49,653
I wasn't finished.

941
01:26:50,571 --> 01:26:53,824
I have fallen so in love with you.

942
01:26:55,576 --> 01:26:58,037
So much more than I told you I would.

943
01:27:04,460 --> 01:27:06,504
All right.

944
01:27:13,844 --> 01:27:15,888
OK.

945
01:27:23,771 --> 01:27:25,815
Come on.

946
01:28:04,728 --> 01:28:07,273
Clear it out! Clear it out!

947
01:28:07,398 --> 01:28:09,442
Clear it out!

948
01:28:13,154 --> 01:28:14,321
- Yeah!
- Oh!

949
01:29:32,608 --> 01:29:36,445
North Stars! North Stars! Yeah!

950
01:29:40,282 --> 01:29:45,996
I can't believe you caught a puck.
That's, like... It's, like, never happened.

951
01:29:46,122 --> 01:29:48,165
Amazing.

952
01:29:50,459 --> 01:29:52,503
You're amazing.

953
01:29:55,881 --> 01:29:58,926
Thank you for taking me, Caroline.

954
01:29:59,051 --> 01:30:01,178
I didn't know if you'd like it.

955
01:30:01,720 --> 01:30:03,764
You know what I like.

956
01:30:06,684 --> 01:30:08,769
I'm glad you like it as much as me.

957
01:30:10,146 --> 01:30:12,189
- I love hockey.
<i>- (laughs)</i>

958
01:30:14,066 --> 01:30:16,986
You didn't even know
what a power play was.

959
01:30:19,780 --> 01:30:22,450
I know, but the next time we go
you can tell me,

960
01:30:22,575 --> 01:30:25,661
and I'll catch another one of these for you.

961
01:30:30,666 --> 01:30:33,127
It was a good game, huh?

962
01:30:34,086 --> 01:30:37,047
Yeah. A good game.

963
01:31:30,768 --> 01:31:32,103
Hey.

964
01:31:33,020 --> 01:31:35,815
Baby. Wake up.

965
01:31:36,732 --> 01:31:38,567
We're home.

966
01:31:38,692 --> 01:31:40,528
Hey.

967
01:31:40,653 --> 01:31:43,280
Wake up. Wake up.

968
01:31:45,533 --> 01:31:48,369
Sweetie. We're home.

969
01:31:51,497 --> 01:31:53,541
Hey!

970
01:31:56,043 --> 01:31:58,087
Hey.

971
01:32:13,018 --> 01:32:15,062
<i>(dog barks)</i>

972
01:32:31,829 --> 01:32:33,873
<i>(sobs)</i>

973
01:32:55,770 --> 01:33:00,566
<i>(priest)</i> If I give away all my possessions,
if I hand over my body so I may boast,

974
01:33:00,691 --> 01:33:03,319
but do not have love, I gain nothing.

975
01:33:03,444 --> 01:33:05,738
Love is patient, love is kind.

976
01:33:05,863 --> 01:33:09,450
Love is not envious or boastful
or arrogant or rude.

977
01:33:09,575 --> 01:33:11,869
It does not insist on its own way.

978
01:33:11,994 --> 01:33:14,038
It is not irritable or resentful.

979
01:33:14,163 --> 01:33:18,375
It does not rejoice in wrongdoing,
but rejoices in the truth.

980
01:33:18,501 --> 01:33:21,420
It bears all things, believes all things,

981
01:33:21,545 --> 01:33:24,131
hopes all things, endures all things.

982
01:33:24,256 --> 01:33:26,300
Love never ends.

983
01:33:26,425 --> 01:33:29,095
But as for prophecies,
they will come to an end.

984
01:33:29,220 --> 01:33:32,807
As for tongues, they will cease.
As for knowledge, it will come to an end.

985
01:33:32,932 --> 01:33:36,727
For we only know in part,
and we prophecy only in part.

986
01:33:36,852 --> 01:33:40,773
But when the complete comes,
the partial will come to an end.

987
01:33:53,536 --> 01:33:55,579
I love you.

988
01:33:57,873 --> 01:34:00,292
You're family.

989
01:34:00,418 --> 01:34:02,461
Good.

990
01:34:03,587 --> 01:34:05,631
You're lucky. I love you too.

991
01:34:09,135 --> 01:34:11,178
Luck has nothing to do with it.

992
01:34:14,390 --> 01:34:16,434
He was like an angel, you know?

993
01:34:18,269 --> 01:34:20,729
I never knew life could be like that.

994
01:34:22,690 --> 01:34:27,862
He was the one thing I followed through
with, the one thing I didn't give up on.

995
01:34:29,697 --> 01:34:31,741
And I was good at loving him.
