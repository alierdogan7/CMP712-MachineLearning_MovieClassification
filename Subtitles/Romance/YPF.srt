Normally my freezer is full.

- In the medicine cabinet.
- Do you think my teeth so white?

I should think that a great flood.

00:09:00,172 --> 00:09:05,961
My teeth are white because when
slept with a few small bulbs.

Wait, what?

90
00:09:07,387 --> 00:09:14,304
I was afraid of the dark, so my
parents bought these special lamps,

91
00:09:14,478 --> 00:09:18,974
whitening my teeth.
- Really?

I'm just not accustomed to guys
here in the first meeting.

Listen. Snoop many cabinets
drugs while pissed.

98
00:09:54,601 --> 00:09:58,219
I'm sure that what you have on your

Okay you can say ...

No, I ...

101
00:10:04,695 --> 00:10:09,191
Yes, I think you relax.
But no matter, really.

102

Relax, I'll stop snooping
and you do not care for what I think.

What do you think?

- Yes.
- Great.

109
00:10:38,353 --> 00:10:41,188
- Here is the problem.
- What?

110

- I do not want to drink it.
- Me neither. Is the pence.

- No problem.

- I think I'm drunk and you?
- I think people expect too much.

Let's take another ...

00:11:08,342 --> 00:11:13,383
It worries me that ...
Do you think we should do this?

00:11:13,555 --> 00:11:18,051
Okay. I understand what you feel, but
listen to me because I will not say twice.

117

I have no desire to return
to hold meetings,

118
00:11:20,687 --> 00:11:22,813
because all the guys I met,
fooled me.

119

In addition to the only man at hand,
is you.

122
00:11:36,078 --> 00:11:40,027
which incidentally was with a bitch.
- Do not call it a bitch ...

123
00:11:40,207 --> 00:11:43,907
What made you seven months ago, and I
treated like shit for six years.

124
00:11:44,086 --> 00:11:47,409
- Six years and four months.
- Oh, you need a shag! ...

125
00:11:47,509 --> 00:11:50,588
- Okay, yes ...
- Desperately ...

126
00:11:50,759 --> 00:11:56,548
and instead of talking, focus on
empty balls. Now. That's it.

127
00:11:56,723 --> 00:12:00,060
It's just that it should think,
because that's all it is.

128
00:12:01,436 --> 00:12:06,857
- Do not want to spoil anything.
- Listen. Sometimes it's something.

129
00:12:07,025 --> 00:12:12,482
Sometimes it has meaning. Sometimes
are caresses and fingers interlaced ...

130
00:12:12,656 --> 00:12:15,443
... And secrets in his ear.

131
00:12:15,617 --> 00:12:17,786

a fuck is just a fuck.

and sleep soon.

- Yes.

- Yes.
- Okay, give five more!

139
00:12:56,074 --> 00:12:57,274
Legal.

140
00:12:59,036 --> 00:13:05,038
Yes I got so many bottles
of wine when I was promoted.

141
00:13:05,208 --> 00:13:10,914
No, I was talking
the place.

142
00:13:11,089 --> 00:13:16,795
Yes I think it also came
with the promotion.

143
00:13:18,221 --> 00:13:21,673
But wine is also great.

144
00:13:21,850 --> 00:13:27,520
I'm amazed,
because you hated wine.

145
00:13:27,689 --> 00:13:29,689
Now taste.

00:13:36,990 --> 00:13:41,190
Jasmine will kill me.

147
00:13:41,662 --> 00:13:45,825
- Why?
- She is so protective.

148
00:13:45,999 --> 00:13:48,324
- I do not tell anyone.
- No?

149
00:13:48,502 --> 00:13:53,627
No. I think they'll tell me,
that is a bad idea ...

150
00:13:53,799 --> 00:13:58,093
Or ... will be hoping to
that we will be together.

151
00:13:58,261 --> 00:14:00,661
Or anything.

- No. Continue.

154
00:14:08,522 --> 00:14:12,354
It was just silly, nothing ...

155
00:14:16,863 --> 00:14:19,533
This is stupid.

156
00:14:22,661 --> 00:14:27,489
You see?
It should not be strange.

157
00:14:27,666 --> 00:14:34,167
We can have a relaxed relationship,
and get excited ...

158
00:14:34,339 --> 00:14:39,085
... And, remain separate.
- I think so.

159
00:14:39,261 --> 00:14:42,297
No, do not you think.
Look at the top, he is wearing.

160
00:14:42,472 --> 00:14:45,343
Look at that outfit.

161

- Enhances the chest.
- I try.

162
00:14:49,771 --> 00:14:55,774
That's what I'm saying. This top is made,
to bring guys like me here.

163
00:14:55,944 --> 00:15:00,321
- Guys like you? How so?
- Gentlemen who like breasts.

164
00:15:00,490 --> 00:15:02,566
No. You're wrong.

165
00:15:02,743 --> 00:15:08,164
This top was made for guys like that
you want to come home with me.

166
00:15:08,332 --> 00:15:12,625
- Ah, I see!
- Do you understand now?

167
00:15:12,794 --> 00:15:18,215
- You want to fill me with regret.
- Repentance is good.

168
00:15:18,383 --> 00:15:22,428
I had no intention of
come?

169
00:15:22,596 --> 00:15:26,428
- No.
- I feel stupid.

170
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:30,644
Well, it was great to see you.
Give my love to Jasmine.

171
00:15:30,812 --> 00:15:34,596
- Kisses for his mother.
- Will be delivered.

172
00:15:34,775 --> 00:15:37,063
No, not going away.

173
00:15:41,907 --> 00:15:44,445
- Andrew?
- What?

174
00:15:44,618 --> 00:15:49,992
What is this?
Are you his birthday.

175
00:15:50,165 --> 00:15:54,708
I do not want all the attention.
I love you baby.

176
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:08,513
- You're the best.
- I am very good ...

177
00:16:08,684 --> 00:16:11,684
Happy birthday.

178
00:16:12,813 --> 00:16:15,897
Good night dear.

179
00:16:20,779 --> 00:16:23,899
- Abby ...
- Andrew.

180
00:16:25,409 --> 00:16:28,279
- Abby ...
- Andrew.

181
00:16:28,453 --> 00:16:32,072
I do not know if I will today.

182
00:16:32,249 --> 00:16:34,325
Is that a question?

183
00:16:34,501 --> 00:16:38,914
No, it's a statement.
I'm tired.

184
00:16:41,967 --> 00:16:45,715
Honey, I have worked very
lately.

185
00:16:45,887 --> 00:16:50,051
And I do not see well with my glasses.

186
00:16:50,225 --> 00:16:54,721
I was pricked in her eyes.
You know.

187
00:16:54,896 --> 00:16:59,309
And eat as much pasta for dinner;
I do not feel very well ...

188
00:16:59,484 --> 00:17:02,139
When going to want?

189
00:17:02,239 --> 00:17:05,291
Do not have a specific day.

190
00:17:05,391 --> 00:17:10,572
- Can be tomorrow?
- Three weeks ago they did not have sex.

191
00:17:10,746 --> 00:17:15,792
- It's been three weeks.
- When was the last time?

192
00:17:17,836 --> 00:17:20,457
- Andrew!
- Did not know he had to say.

193
00:17:20,631 --> 00:17:23,786
No need. The response was
always be, "last night."

194
00:17:23,886 --> 00:17:25,922
Nobody does every night.

195
00:17:26,094 --> 00:17:31,634
- Malcolm and Beatrice do.
- You can not believe what they say.

196
00:17:31,808 --> 00:17:35,260
- I love you.
- I love you too.

197
00:17:35,437 --> 00:17:40,680
- I need orgasms, Andrew.
- I know.

198
00:17:43,403 --> 00:17:46,155
Okay. Go for it.

199
00:17:46,323 --> 00:17:52,123
Now.
I want to do. I'm ready.

200
00:17:52,663 --> 00:17:55,063
I'm anxious.

201
00:18:00,295 --> 00:18:03,079
- Honey?
- What?

202
00:18:03,179 --> 00:18:04,486
Thought I'd start.

203
00:18:04,758 --> 00:18:08,834
It's always me that first.
It's always me that got the initiative.

204
00:18:08,934 --> 00:18:10,762
Why do not you get
this time?

205
00:18:10,931 --> 00:18:17,929
As is already excited, could
help me catch up.

206
00:18:18,105 --> 00:18:21,937
- No. I know your tricks.
- My what?

207
00:18:22,109 --> 00:18:24,820
- You do not suck.
- Do not say, never!

208
00:18:24,924 --> 00:18:26,905
I expected to do before.

209
00:18:27,009 --> 00:18:31,190
Then, pretending to be very
excited and full of passion,

210
00:18:31,290 --> 00:18:35,412
as needed
I hold fast,

211
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:39,578
and conveniently skips my turn.

212
00:18:39,751 --> 00:18:42,788
- I think this is not true.
- Yes yes!

213
00:18:42,963 --> 00:18:47,210
Not to pretend to believe a lie.

214
00:18:48,051 --> 00:18:52,381
- What is happening to us?
- I'm saying do it now!

215
00:18:52,556 --> 00:18:57,799
You want passion and excitement?
You can count on it.

216
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:04,275
How am I doing so far?

217
00:19:04,443 --> 00:19:08,310
- Well
- Is that okay?

218
00:19:09,031 --> 00:19:11,431
That's good.

219
00:19:19,958 --> 00:19:22,283
- Are you ready?
- Yes.

220
00:19:22,461 --> 00:19:26,861
- There are new?
- St.

221
00:19:28,091 --> 00:19:33,465
Appear expensive.
I thought we talk about big purchases.

222
00:19:35,307 --> 00:19:40,099
- Andrew ...
- Sorry, that's fine.

223
00:20:59,036 --> 00:21:00,183
So ...?

224
00:21:00,809 --> 00:21:03,801
Oh, yes Dave. I'm not going
meter, so to speak.

225
00:21:03,979 --> 00:21:11,987
I told you, but I
just watch and be on my own.

226
00:21:12,529 --> 00:21:16,741
- Great.
- Dave, I always thought it was really cool.

227
00:21:16,908 --> 00:21:19,508
- So.
- Okay.

228
00:21:20,037 --> 00:21:24,663
Sometimes we do not get along,
and sometimes even hate.

229
00:21:24,833 --> 00:21:27,682
But soon, we get
a place e. ..

230
00:21:27,782 --> 00:21:30,213
... Where we want to do this.
and now here you are.

231
00:21:30,380 --> 00:21:36,467
- I always found you ...
- She always says you're cool.

232
00:21:36,567 --> 00:21:37,552
Right.

233
00:21:37,652 --> 00:21:40,971
We love each other very much.
I love you baby.

234
00:21:41,141 --> 00:21:44,557
- Oh my God, you're so hot.
- My God, how I love you!

235
00:21:44,728 --> 00:21:48,678
It's the sexiest thing in the world.

236
00:21:48,857 --> 00:21:52,319
Today we'll make new friends.

237
00:21:56,114 --> 00:21:59,609
- There may be a problem.
- Am I?

238
00:21:59,709 --> 00:22:03,117
She's hot, is not it David?

239
00:22:03,288 --> 00:22:07,831
Yes, she's great ...
You're great.

240
00:22:08,001 --> 00:22:16,424
There's something in me that can lead
you do not want to do this.

241
00:22:16,718 --> 00:22:18,282
You know.

242
00:22:30,691 --> 00:22:32,491
Gord ...?

243
00:22:37,197 --> 00:22:41,693
That? That's the problem?
I already knew.

244
00:22:41,868 --> 00:22:44,620
It will be great.
I'm very excited!

245
00:22:44,788 --> 00:22:46,843
- I know ...?
- Not excited?

246
00:22:46,943 --> 00:22:47,826
Am.

247
00:22:47,926 --> 00:22:51,658
- How did you know ...?
- We discovered, was not it?

248
00:22:51,837 --> 00:22:54,672
- Should I ...?
- Yes, very well, very well.

249
00:22:57,342 --> 00:23:00,749
Oh my God!
You're so sexy!

250
00:23:00,849 --> 00:23:02,301
You're very tasty!

251
00:23:02,472 --> 00:23:06,351
Oh, yes ... Only
Get over there!

252
00:23:07,686 --> 00:23:10,011
This is cool.

253
00:23:11,857 --> 00:23:15,142
<i>II - Preliminary </ i></i>

254
00:23:18,864 --> 00:23:23,407
It's amazing!
Oh, my God!

255
00:23:23,577 --> 00:23:26,177
Is this true?

256
00:23:28,332 --> 00:23:32,792
- I asked if it is true?
- Sure.

257
00:23:32,961 --> 00:23:35,666
- Really?
- Yes.

258
00:23:37,674 --> 00:23:41,674
- Is it true?
- Yes.

259
00:23:42,679 --> 00:23:48,883
Jamie ... Do not know what you
're talking darling, sorry.

260
00:23:52,189 --> 00:23:56,518
When I said I liked
even me it was serious?

261
00:23:56,693 --> 00:23:58,769
Yes, of course.

262
00:24:00,864 --> 00:24:06,024
- I bet it says it all.
- I say yes.

263
00:24:07,287 --> 00:24:09,992
What?
Shall I lie to you?

264
00:24:10,165 --> 00:24:14,329
I tell others that I love them, but with
you're different. With you is the truth.

265
00:24:14,503 --> 00:24:17,709
How do I know what's different?

266
00:24:21,802 --> 00:24:23,918
I respect you enough to
put it aside.

267
00:24:24,128 --> 00:24:25,588
- What?
- I respect you.

268
00:24:26,807 --> 00:24:30,306
Respect is the opposite
to like someone.

269
00:24:30,477 --> 00:24:31,846
Not always.

270
00:24:32,056 --> 00:24:34,558
This is not coming out,
as I had thought.

271
00:24:38,422 --> 00:24:39,422
Look ...

272
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:45,301
I'm just trying to say
I like you. That's it.

273
00:24:45,928 --> 00:24:48,118
If trans is night, great.

274
00:24:48,495 --> 00:24:51,746
Otherwise ... If you still do not trust
me enough, is understandable.

275
00:24:51,915 --> 00:24:56,244
And if it means having to suspend
physical contact ...

276
00:24:56,420 --> 00:25:02,956
... And back to the conversation,
then talk to you all night.

277
00:25:03,135 --> 00:25:08,260
I want to know everything about you.

278
00:25:10,350 --> 00:25:12,806
For example, what is this?

279
00:25:12,978 --> 00:25:16,410
This is my digital massager.
I should not have seen it.

280
00:25:16,586 --> 00:25:18,978
Digital massager ...
How does this work?

281
00:25:19,881 --> 00:25:22,317
- Ken.
- Yes.

282
00:25:22,487 --> 00:25:26,532
We have to talk.
I believe in you.

283
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:28,100
Really?

284
00:25:30,370 --> 00:25:34,748
This means that not
like my conversation?

285
00:25:34,916 --> 00:25:40,456
No, I love your conversation.
Can we talk later?

286
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:42,340
Okay.

287
00:25:55,896 --> 00:25:58,487
Think of others
when we make love?

288
00:25:58,587 --> 00:25:59,581
What?

289
00:25:59,858 --> 00:26:04,225
Sometimes I feel that is not here.
Looks like you are somewhere else.

290
00:26:04,404 --> 00:26:07,688
You see what I'm trying to do?
Where could I be?

291
00:26:07,866 --> 00:26:11,780
Sorry. You're right.
Continue.

292
00:26:13,351 --> 00:26:14,351
Oh! Thanks.

293
00:26:17,751 --> 00:26:20,157
- It's that I'm not as accomplished?
- Sorry?

294
00:26:20,257 --> 00:26:22,735
The reason for not wanting to suck me,
is not to be so fulfilling?

295
00:26:22,835 --> 00:26:26,505
Who says I do not want?
I'm doing the best I can.

296
00:26:26,677 --> 00:26:31,006
Just because I stopped shaving
you stopped sucking me.

297
00:26:31,181 --> 00:26:37,136
Want to talk about oral sex, or
want to let me perform oral sex?

298
00:26:37,312 --> 00:26:39,712
Okay. Sorry.

299
00:26:47,906 --> 00:26:52,200
Now it seems that you missing. Never
look at me when I'm down here.

300
00:26:52,369 --> 00:26:55,156
- What all four times?
- I'm serious.

301
00:26:55,330 --> 00:26:59,198
- Think about other people?
- No.

302
00:26:59,376 --> 00:27:02,994
Honey, that's fine, you can say.
I think.

303
00:27:03,171 --> 00:27:08,332
- Think! Why not me?
- Only sometimes. You also think, confess.

304
00:27:11,451 --> 00:27:14,257
Yes, I think. Sometimes.

305
00:27:16,789 --> 00:27:17,789
Who?

306
00:27:17,991 --> 00:27:19,764
- Who?
- Yes Who?

307
00:27:20,808 --> 00:27:22,356
Who do you think?

308
00:27:22,456 --> 00:27:26,853
- Had to make a list.
- There is always the same person?

309
00:27:27,029 --> 00:27:30,445
No, it's like a carousel
people with whom I have sex.

310
00:27:30,616 --> 00:27:34,067
You always think in
same person?

311
00:27:34,244 --> 00:27:37,909
Think. It's Malcolm?
Why do you think he's a doctor?

312
00:27:38,081 --> 00:27:43,242
- Not the Malcolm.
- Then who is?

313
00:27:43,420 --> 00:27:48,794
Ian Ziering. He does, Steve Sanders
on "Beverly Hills" ...

314
00:27:48,967 --> 00:27:52,170
I know who it is.

315
00:27:53,513 --> 00:27:56,313
Are you angry?

316
00:27:57,476 --> 00:28:01,390
- Let's just continue, okay.
- Okay.

317
00:28:01,563 --> 00:28:04,481
It'll be good, I'm ready, come on.

318
00:28:04,650 --> 00:28:07,650
- We do.
- Yes!

319
00:28:08,904 --> 00:28:12,524
- Wherever resume?
- Want to start with a kiss?

320
00:28:13,046 --> 00:28:14,402
I do not know. You want it?

321
00:28:31,551 --> 00:28:34,135
Okay. Stop, stop,
Stop, stop!

322
00:28:34,804 --> 00:28:37,091
- You can not do that.
- What?

323
00:28:37,265 --> 00:28:39,087
You can not look at me
while doing so.

324
00:28:39,187 --> 00:28:40,807
- Why not?
- Why me crazy.

325
00:28:41,186 --> 00:28:43,461
I thought you said you liked ...

326
00:28:43,561 --> 00:28:46,170
No, yes. It's different all right.

327
00:28:46,379 --> 00:28:49,561
With other girls I think:
"A hot making me a blowjob!"

328
00:28:49,736 --> 00:28:55,323
As you think, "It's Kris Anne, with
my cock in the mouth and it drives me mad. "

329
00:28:56,013 --> 00:28:58,528
Okay.
Forget the blowjob.

330
00:29:00,122 --> 00:29:02,529
Let's stay calm.

331
00:29:02,708 --> 00:29:05,874
Let's put a song.

332
00:29:06,044 --> 00:29:08,998
We need rhythm, sensuality,
noise and distraction.

333
00:29:09,172 --> 00:29:13,087
- I was thinking ...
- What we need is music.

334
00:29:13,260 --> 00:29:15,667
- All right.
- Okay.

335
00:29:16,888 --> 00:29:20,257
We have better than this.

336
00:29:20,434 --> 00:29:24,218
- You're so gay.
- You who are gay.

337
00:29:27,524 --> 00:29:31,356
This is better, right.
We could ...

338
00:29:31,527 --> 00:29:32,520
I hate this.

339
00:29:32,620 --> 00:29:36,439
- Why hate?
- It was my song with Dimitris.

340
00:29:36,617 --> 00:29:39,452
Jessica and I had no song.

341
00:29:39,620 --> 00:29:45,206
At first I thought it cool, but after
that stupid touched everywhere

342
00:29:45,375 --> 00:29:49,290
and I, every time they heard it,
went crazy.

343
00:29:49,463 --> 00:29:52,547
Oh my God!
Have you seen how it is disturbed?

344
00:29:52,716 --> 00:29:58,920
We should leave this
and you pretended I was him ...

345
00:29:59,097 --> 00:30:03,843
- Fuck you.
- You are right. Sorry. It was stupid.

346
00:30:05,979 --> 00:30:10,522
- Want to talk about it?
- This is the same.

347
00:30:25,228 --> 00:30:28,034
- It's OK I'm here?
- No.

348
00:30:28,669 --> 00:30:34,458
Just want to know.
It's okay, right?

349
00:30:38,345 --> 00:30:42,010
Do not want to feel
an idiot tomorrow.

350
00:30:42,182 --> 00:30:46,132
It does not hurt to be here.
Seriously.

351
00:30:56,989 --> 00:31:00,239
So you do not love me anymore?

352
00:31:00,409 --> 00:31:04,027
- What? Do not do it.
- You do not love me, right?

353
00:31:04,204 --> 00:31:10,124
- Of course not, Mia.
- Eric, this is just for fun, is not it?

354
00:31:10,335 --> 00:31:13,135
According Yes.

355
00:31:13,588 --> 00:31:16,293
- So we're well?
- Certainly. Say no more.

356
00:31:19,469 --> 00:31:22,257
That's better.
Hello ladies.

357
00:31:22,431 --> 00:31:28,220
- Stop talking to my chest.
- I'm just being polite.

358
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:37,229
I said, not said ...?
If there were any problems ...

359
00:31:37,404 --> 00:31:42,695
Maybe I should stop talking ...

360
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:53,914
Never thought this would happen.
Please.

361
00:31:54,086 --> 00:31:56,122
What style. Do not use it ...

362
00:31:56,222 --> 00:31:58,796
... Because it is comfortable.
- Shut up.

363
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:47,883
Grab it, have, throw yourself into it.

364
00:32:48,058 --> 00:32:50,763
- Go and have it all.
- What?

365
00:32:50,936 --> 00:32:54,056
I'm just saying
grab it and owns it.

366
00:32:54,231 --> 00:32:56,307
We're already doing it ...

367
00:32:56,483 --> 00:33:00,101
Not now.
But before ...

368
00:33:00,279 --> 00:33:03,333
It made sense when I said:
"Grab it and owns it."

369
00:33:03,433 --> 00:33:04,739
- That's it.
- Okay.

370
00:33:13,604 --> 00:33:17,289
She likes that you fool
in your hair.

371
00:33:17,462 --> 00:33:21,127
I said, she likes
that stir in your hair.

372
00:33:22,384 --> 00:33:28,885
I'm just saying. Do not be afraid.
Grab it, have, go up to her.

373
00:33:29,057 --> 00:33:31,257
We're fine.

374
00:33:39,610 --> 00:33:44,318
I am helping you. So when
I say you should do what I say.

375
00:33:44,489 --> 00:33:48,439
Because I'm here.
This is also for me.

376
00:33:48,619 --> 00:33:52,153
It's not like sex,
in front of the dog.

377
00:33:52,331 --> 00:33:55,616
Do not want to be boring.
I'm just saying.

378
00:33:55,792 --> 00:34:02,330
Sorry. I wish this were
smooth and nice and soft and sensual.

379
00:34:03,237 --> 00:34:06,966
So ... I'll be here.

380
00:34:08,388 --> 00:34:12,137
- Likes to mess with hair like that?
- Yes ..

381
00:34:13,226 --> 00:34:20,771
Yeah, great. Relax and
naturally do everything ...

382
00:34:20,943 --> 00:34:23,343
- So?
- Yes.

383
00:34:27,366 --> 00:34:30,948
This. Who is this?

384
00:34:31,119 --> 00:34:33,657
Who is your new friend?

385
00:34:37,459 --> 00:34:39,087
What?
What happened?

386
00:34:39,187 --> 00:34:41,223
I put hair spray here.

387
00:34:41,505 --> 00:34:45,289
The perfume bottle was empty.
Sorry.

388
00:34:45,467 --> 00:34:50,674
Okay, okay. Just shit.
If caress. Nobody wants that.

389
00:34:50,847 --> 00:34:54,014
- I like ...
- No one wants that vote.

390
00:34:54,184 --> 00:34:58,513
We do not cherish.
Therefore, do not want you to caress.

391
00:34:58,689 --> 00:35:03,289
Go to it and finish it.

392
00:35:03,527 --> 00:35:08,354
Have fun and treat her like a piece
meat. Only a sex game.

393
00:35:08,532 --> 00:35:13,490
Just holding. Only pleasure.
An erotic ride.

394
00:35:13,662 --> 00:35:16,062
Okay.
Gimme.

395
00:35:17,165 --> 00:35:19,917
Why are you looking at me?
Give it to her.

396
00:35:20,085 --> 00:35:25,162
- Gord, I love you.
- You're so hot.

397
00:35:25,340 --> 00:35:27,762
Oh my God!
Continue ... So! ...

398
00:35:27,862 --> 00:35:33,035
Okay, here we go.
That's cool.

399
00:35:34,308 --> 00:35:38,708
<i>III - SEX </ i></i>

400
00:35:41,586 --> 00:35:44,023
Can I say something?

401
00:35:44,192 --> 00:35:49,898
- I love your sheets.
- They're good, are not they?

402
00:35:50,073 --> 00:35:53,027
- You know I'm not wearing anything.
- I know.

403
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:54,193
As you know everything?

404
00:35:54,293 --> 00:35:57,330
- Something.
- I think so.

405
00:35:57,497 --> 00:35:59,943
- I am healthy.
- I believe you.

406
00:36:00,043 --> 00:36:01,299
I take tests regularly.

407
00:36:01,399 --> 00:36:03,211
I believe. Otherwise the
girls had said.

408
00:36:03,311 --> 00:36:08,525
- I'll take, to be sure.
- Just tell me when it comes.

409
00:36:08,625 --> 00:36:10,176
Okay, I promise.

410
00:36:10,802 --> 00:36:15,004
I promise not to spoil
These wonderful sheets.

411
00:36:17,267 --> 00:36:20,802
- Can I say one more thing?
- At ease.

412
00:36:20,979 --> 00:36:24,099
You're beautiful.

413
00:36:24,274 --> 00:36:27,643
Seriously! Seriously! Seriously!

414
00:36:27,819 --> 00:36:32,149
Your eyes are like
pots of hazelnut.

415
00:36:33,659 --> 00:36:37,028
Sorry, I do not ...

416
00:36:37,204 --> 00:36:40,158
Normally I do not ...

417
00:36:42,209 --> 00:36:45,909
Damn! You're beautiful.

418
00:36:46,088 --> 00:36:48,088
Thank you.

419
00:36:50,092 --> 00:36:51,374
Thank you.

420
00:36:51,510 --> 00:36:54,215
Wait, I know that look!

421
00:36:54,388 --> 00:36:56,626
It's the look that I do
the girls ...

422
00:36:56,726 --> 00:36:58,971
Who say never
had come so far.

423
00:37:00,328 --> 00:37:02,309
Fucked it, right?

424
00:37:16,285 --> 00:37:18,085
Kriss ...

425
00:37:21,623 --> 00:37:24,410
Oh, Kristine ...

426
00:37:29,965 --> 00:37:34,094
- Kristine Armstrong!
- I need some dirty, now.

427
00:37:34,615 --> 00:37:35,814
Must be kidding?

428
00:37:35,929 --> 00:37:39,594
- Excite me.
- Okay.

429
00:37:39,766 --> 00:37:44,677
Do not invent.
Just follow your intuition.

430
00:37:44,855 --> 00:37:50,276
I'll stick in your ass so hard
that even your breath will smell the cock.

431
00:37:50,444 --> 00:37:56,363
After you thread it into the mouth to
the taste of her ass.

432
00:37:57,909 --> 00:38:00,910
- So here goes ...
- Jesus Christ!

433
00:38:01,079 --> 00:38:03,155
What?
I thought that was what he wanted.

434
00:38:03,332 --> 00:38:07,199
- Why would you want that?
- Because it is a disgusting whore.

435
00:38:08,086 --> 00:38:12,084
- Sorry.
- Okay, okay, it's my fault.

436
00:38:12,257 --> 00:38:15,072
- Carry on, friend.
- Okay.

437
00:38:17,679 --> 00:38:19,279
Like it?

438
00:38:27,147 --> 00:38:29,874
We should be having sex,
and not talking about it.

439
00:38:29,983 --> 00:38:32,482
Perhaps the fault is not ours.

440
00:38:32,653 --> 00:38:35,736
Maybe we're older and
with reduced sexual appetite.

441
00:38:36,154 --> 00:38:37,114
We have 26 years!

442
00:38:37,214 --> 00:38:38,139
There are 19.

443
00:38:38,239 --> 00:38:40,783
But when we do not
love you masturbate, do you?

444
00:38:40,883 --> 00:38:43,683
Not every day.

445
00:38:43,872 --> 00:38:48,084
Listen, make love, it is very
different from masturbating.

446
00:38:48,251 --> 00:38:52,629
It's like eating a barrinha,
and this is one meal.

447
00:38:52,798 --> 00:38:56,665
And you have eaten bars. I
I've seen, so do not say no.

448
00:38:56,843 --> 00:39:00,971
- Yes.
- So there it is.

449
00:39:01,139 --> 00:39:06,928
This is bullshit. If we masturbate,
why not do together?

450
00:39:07,104 --> 00:39:11,053
Why do not we have sex
more times?

451
00:39:14,069 --> 00:39:17,272
I think we both know ...

452
00:39:17,447 --> 00:39:22,109
I'm not very interesting
in bed.

453
00:39:23,287 --> 00:39:29,621
I see they can not excite you,
and I lack motivation.

454
00:39:29,793 --> 00:39:35,796
- What?
- I know I've never been to, "Mr. Sex".

455
00:39:35,966 --> 00:39:38,801
I have no way. I know.
No need to say.

456
00:39:38,969 --> 00:39:43,714
Not true. If it was not good,
Why would you marry me?

457
00:39:43,890 --> 00:39:48,469
Why, afraid to be alone.

458
00:39:48,645 --> 00:39:49,645
What?

459
00:39:52,149 --> 00:39:57,309
You think the only reason,
to be with you ...

460
00:39:57,487 --> 00:39:59,687
Oh, my God!

461
00:40:01,074 --> 00:40:06,579
You think the only reason for being
with you is afraid of being alone?

462
00:40:06,747 --> 00:40:11,243
- There is a little truth?
- Are you asking me?

463
00:40:11,918 --> 00:40:19,250
Oh my God! If you think
only reason for being together ...

464
00:40:19,426 --> 00:40:24,966
I think I do not attract you.
I am no longer beautiful.

465
00:40:25,140 --> 00:40:27,540
No dear, no!

466
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:32,772
- Up to guess, it's prettier.
- You think?

467
00:40:32,939 --> 00:40:35,609
- I think.
- Really?

468
00:40:36,777 --> 00:40:41,189
I mean, you put on e. ..

469
00:40:43,408 --> 00:40:46,694
No, dear.
Was a positive way.

470
00:40:46,870 --> 00:40:51,164
Gave a stuffed.
No longer looks like a girl.

471
00:40:53,502 --> 00:40:58,792
Did you mean ... I do not know what to say.
Whatever I say?

472
00:40:58,966 --> 00:41:04,589
- I wish it would work.
- Me too.

473
00:41:08,308 --> 00:41:11,891
Maybe we're just
Tired of the same thing.

474
00:41:12,062 --> 00:41:14,434
- I think not.
- Admit it, please.

475
00:41:14,606 --> 00:41:20,691
- Okay. Perhaps, yes.
- We have to try something different.

476
00:41:21,405 --> 00:41:25,805
Sure. For example ...?

477
00:41:27,369 --> 00:41:29,527
Something exciting.

478
00:41:29,705 --> 00:41:30,705
Okay.

479
00:41:33,292 --> 00:41:36,992
How to type in the bathtub
or something?

480
00:41:37,170 --> 00:41:41,667
I have the perfect idea.

481
00:41:47,055 --> 00:41:50,175
You can do anything with me.

482
00:41:50,350 --> 00:41:53,020
Anything you want.

483
00:41:53,186 --> 00:41:55,475
- You talking to me?
- Yes.

484
00:41:55,647 --> 00:41:58,221
It means putting in the ass
face.

485
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:03,856
- They had forgotten me? Do not stop.
- Did not mean: "Meta in the ass."

486
00:42:04,031 --> 00:42:08,377
I did not want to stop. Thought
were close. I know I am.

487
00:42:08,477 --> 00:42:09,992
Continue, continue.

488
00:42:10,996 --> 00:42:12,203
Come on.

489
00:42:13,624 --> 00:42:15,996
Not mean: "Target in the ass."

490
00:42:16,168 --> 00:42:17,187
His hand ...

491
00:42:17,606 --> 00:42:19,568
- Yes.
- Your hand is on my ass.

492
00:42:19,668 --> 00:42:24,712
I know. It is to feel the rhythm of the thing.
Still not finished, man.

493
00:42:24,885 --> 00:42:28,085
- Come on.
- No.

494
00:42:28,889 --> 00:42:33,266
- Do you mind sitting over there?
- Oh yes, of course.

495
00:42:33,435 --> 00:42:37,931
- Did not mean: "Meta in the ass."
- He has done almost everything ...

496
00:42:38,106 --> 00:42:44,476
What is meant by:
"You can do everything with me?"

497
00:42:47,157 --> 00:42:51,321
I do not know, but would not say, "Ass."
I do not do that.

498
00:42:51,495 --> 00:42:57,248
- We both do.
- Yes, but this is different. It is ...

499
00:42:57,918 --> 00:43:02,663
Ah yes! I think she is saying,
you're too big.

500
00:43:02,839 --> 00:43:05,509
That's what you meant?

501
00:43:17,938 --> 00:43:20,974
Okay, calm down a bit.

502
00:43:21,149 --> 00:43:24,933
If you want to control the speed,
back up.

503
00:43:25,112 --> 00:43:30,106
- How long does this, Mary?
- Slower. Seriously.

504
00:43:30,284 --> 00:43:35,195
- Too much for you, Nancy?
- To call me with these names?

505
00:43:35,372 --> 00:43:38,575
- Suzie. Debbie.
- Stop, stop, stop.

506
00:43:38,750 --> 00:43:41,750
Would you stop?

507
00:43:47,509 --> 00:43:51,174
- I was almost coming.
- No. ..

508
00:43:51,346 --> 00:43:55,889
- Still has not come.
- It's too careful. Relax.

509
00:43:56,059 --> 00:44:00,259
Sorry.
I had to stop.

510
00:44:00,897 --> 00:44:03,649
I knew what he was doing.

511
00:44:03,817 --> 00:44:08,111
Just wanted to take, "my first man"
the path.

512
00:44:08,280 --> 00:44:10,680
Relax, okay?

513
00:44:15,704 --> 00:44:18,325
I'll get a drink.
Also want one?

514
00:44:20,334 --> 00:44:24,830
A drink would be great.
Thanks.

515
00:44:27,591 --> 00:44:31,635
- What about you?
- You talking to me?

516
00:44:31,803 --> 00:44:32,403
No.

517
00:45:18,225 --> 00:45:20,763
- Here, sweetie.
- Thanks.

518
00:45:23,939 --> 00:45:29,395
- "My first man '! It's like the name?
- It's better after the first.

519
00:45:29,569 --> 00:45:34,362
Stop worrying on hold.
Stay present, give me more pleasure.

520
00:45:34,533 --> 00:45:37,866
Think you know me well,
huh?

521
00:45:38,036 --> 00:45:42,248
I was talking to her
penis just was not she?

522
00:45:42,416 --> 00:45:44,616
Yes it was.

523
00:45:46,169 --> 00:45:48,458
<i>IV - Interlude </ i></i>

524
00:45:48,630 --> 00:45:54,466
- We can take a break?
- Sure. Yeah, sure, sure.

525
00:45:54,636 --> 00:45:57,922
I have to pee, so ...

526
00:45:58,098 --> 00:45:59,098
Okay.

527
00:46:08,817 --> 00:46:10,017
So ...

528
00:46:16,158 --> 00:46:17,558
Why me?

529
00:46:18,827 --> 00:46:24,497
We're almost changing, and Inez
you know. This is important.

530
00:46:24,666 --> 00:46:27,450
It had to be someone who
were able to do ...

531
00:46:27,556 --> 00:46:30,475
And as you know was very
equipped ... It was perfect

532
00:46:30,777 --> 00:46:34,009
- How is what ...
- Would you stop? I do not like you anymore.

533
00:46:34,113 --> 00:46:38,380
Do not hate you
but we were friends and we are not.

534
00:46:38,555 --> 00:46:40,741
Of course, when we leave
to be roommates,

535
00:46:40,950 --> 00:46:44,808
I'll stop hating you.
Until we can be friends again.

536
00:46:44,978 --> 00:46:53,520
But it is easier to see you do it
than someone who I ... Do not like it.

537
00:46:56,198 --> 00:46:58,232
And also because Gord,
you find attractive.

538
00:46:58,337 --> 00:46:59,380
Right!

539
00:47:06,500 --> 00:47:10,912
We never had problems with that.
We're good at it.

540
00:47:11,088 --> 00:47:15,168
- Secondly, all the rest ...
- Yes.

541
00:47:17,219 --> 00:47:20,754
- What do you mean?
- I mean ...

542
00:47:20,931 --> 00:47:24,514
- Yes, of course ... But ...
- But what?

543
00:47:26,937 --> 00:47:31,433
We had no physical contact,
because we had problems.

544
00:47:31,608 --> 00:47:35,309
I did not mean that he disliked,
do not think so.

545
00:47:35,487 --> 00:47:39,734
Okay, but ...
Blame me for that?

546
00:47:41,785 --> 00:47:47,289
- You think it's my fault?
- It's not you, Eric.

547
00:47:47,457 --> 00:47:52,092
- Do not tell me what I think.
- So you think it's my fault?

548
00:47:52,192 --> 00:47:53,170
Stop.

549
00:47:53,270 --> 00:47:56,754
I know what you think,
because it is very obvious.

550
00:47:56,925 --> 00:48:00,508
Stop it. Seriously.

551
00:48:09,021 --> 00:48:15,901
- Still got that ...?
- No, I do not ...

552
00:48:16,069 --> 00:48:21,609
I do not do well with this
of a man and a woman ....

553
00:48:21,783 --> 00:48:28,913
Right now gives me no pleasure.
But would not be here ...

554
00:48:29,082 --> 00:48:33,032
- You're with someone?
- No.

555
00:48:33,211 --> 00:48:39,166
- What happened to the guy's job?
- Which one?

556
00:48:39,343 --> 00:48:43,672
- Which one?
- There were two.

557
00:48:43,847 --> 00:48:47,596
The one that told me,
Tristan was.

558
00:48:47,768 --> 00:48:52,311
A true male.
One of the tight T-shirts?

559
00:48:52,481 --> 00:48:56,858
- No. Stop.
- What was the name the other?

560
00:48:57,027 --> 00:49:02,448
- It's not important.
- Why? He was a friend of mine?

561
00:49:02,616 --> 00:49:05,154
- No.
- No? What was his name?

562
00:49:05,327 --> 00:49:07,865
- No.
- Sorry? Really?

563
00:49:08,038 --> 00:49:11,371
Should tell me your name.

564
00:49:11,541 --> 00:49:15,242
Give it up, ma'am.
Contact. Come on.

565
00:49:15,420 --> 00:49:17,220
F-Dog Mac

566
00:49:18,256 --> 00:49:21,460
- Do not say anything.
- F-Dog Mac?

567
00:49:21,635 --> 00:49:25,004
Is the name of a rap or
a street or something.

568
00:49:25,180 --> 00:49:29,474
Or name of prison!
What the fuck?

569
00:49:29,643 --> 00:49:31,885
What you're jealous.

570
00:49:32,062 --> 00:49:36,724
No, not jealous. Am
trying to understand what the F.

571
00:49:36,900 --> 00:49:41,313
- Why are you so jealous?
- I'm not jealous.

572
00:49:41,488 --> 00:49:44,688
I'm not jealous.

573
00:49:44,950 --> 00:49:48,070
I just wanted to know ...

574
00:49:48,245 --> 00:49:55,208
Just wanted to know if you're treated well ...

575
00:49:55,377 --> 00:49:58,544
I want to be happy.

576
00:49:58,714 --> 00:50:00,714
I'm happy.

577
00:50:03,010 --> 00:50:06,410
Great. Very good.

578
00:50:08,974 --> 00:50:14,134
- And you?
- Me? I am very happy.

579
00:50:15,439 --> 00:50:18,890
- Very happy.
- Great.

580
00:50:24,364 --> 00:50:29,525
- Sorry to have stopped.
- Okay. No problem.

581
00:50:29,703 --> 00:50:33,866
If you slept with all there
work as ...?

582
00:50:34,041 --> 00:50:36,594
Let me stop you there.
I did not sleep with all ...

583
00:50:36,908 --> 00:50:39,202
For example, Mariah.
Never sleep with Mariah ...

584
00:50:39,379 --> 00:50:45,797
Was there before you. And Christina ...
It was beautiful. I never touched her.

585
00:50:45,969 --> 00:50:48,169
Shakira ...

586
00:50:49,264 --> 00:50:52,847
Damn, I'm lying. Sorry.
I'm reading the covers of CD's.

587
00:50:53,018 --> 00:50:55,260
Yes, I slept with them all.
Continue.

588
00:50:55,437 --> 00:51:01,974
I thought it would be different.
With all this intimacy.

589
00:51:02,152 --> 00:51:05,486
Not that you do not like ...
I like it, but ...

590
00:51:05,656 --> 00:51:11,077
Sorry. It was my fault. I was rushed
and said things that did not say in bed.

591
00:51:11,244 --> 00:51:14,411
Not sure why. I. ..

592
00:51:14,581 --> 00:51:17,781
What do you say?

593
00:51:18,085 --> 00:51:24,088
You know, "It has the best ass I've ever seen"
the kind of thing that builds self-esteem.

594
00:51:24,257 --> 00:51:28,919
- What do you think of my ass?
- I think is the best ass I've ever seen!

595
00:51:29,096 --> 00:51:31,800
- I'm serious.
- Me too.

596
00:51:31,974 --> 00:51:37,810
And you have to believe me.
I'ma professional. It is a masterpiece!

597
00:51:38,939 --> 00:51:43,933
Very good. I'm going back
with you on one condition.

598
00:51:44,111 --> 00:51:46,540
It has to stop the conversation

599
00:51:46,645 --> 00:51:48,939
because I'm a player,
and this triggers the schema.

600
00:51:49,116 --> 00:51:50,516
Agreed?

601
00:51:53,704 --> 00:51:56,904
- Deal.
- Great.

602
00:52:12,097 --> 00:52:14,469
I know what you're thinking.

603
00:52:20,856 --> 00:52:24,474
I lied. I do not know what you're thinking.
What are you thinking?

604
00:52:24,651 --> 00:52:28,234
To get started ...
Where did you get that?

605
00:52:28,405 --> 00:52:34,657
It was a prize, the festival of Michelle.
I won it.

606
00:52:37,748 --> 00:52:41,164
- So you ...?
- I use it.

607
00:52:41,335 --> 00:52:44,668
- And you ...?
- I'll fuck you.

608
00:52:48,717 --> 00:52:51,755
You like a little finger
there occasionally.

609
00:52:51,861 --> 00:52:54,885
You put my hand there,
when you're drunk.

610
00:52:55,474 --> 00:52:58,677
This is a little bigger than a pinky.

611
00:52:58,852 --> 00:53:02,351
- We use a lubricant.
- Really?

612
00:53:03,857 --> 00:53:08,057
Neither wants to try?

613
00:53:10,030 --> 00:53:13,230
You know, it ...

614
00:53:14,743 --> 00:53:17,923
G may have a point there,
not yet discovered.

615
00:53:18,029 --> 00:53:20,844
Not, not the least bit curious?

616
00:53:21,124 --> 00:53:26,545
I have what? I do not know that.
How do you know? Where is it?

617
00:53:26,713 --> 00:53:29,513
I have a what?

618
00:53:30,300 --> 00:53:34,512
Sorry I brought it up.
Okay?

619
00:53:34,680 --> 00:53:38,179
I'll take it.
You can relax.

620
00:53:39,226 --> 00:53:40,702
After we ...

621
00:53:43,727 --> 00:53:46,125
I do not know what we do.

622
00:53:52,948 --> 00:53:55,700
And what this has to
good for you?

623
00:53:59,496 --> 00:54:05,036
Here is a small vibrator
for me.

624
00:54:07,337 --> 00:54:10,706
Then have an orgasm?

625
00:54:10,882 --> 00:54:12,482
Oh, yes!

626
00:54:24,271 --> 00:54:26,726
- Okay.
- Really?

627
00:54:26,898 --> 00:54:29,769
Yeah, okay, okay.

628
00:54:29,943 --> 00:54:32,143
Okay, okay.

629
00:54:33,905 --> 00:54:37,505
I'll just ... Lie.

630
00:54:38,910 --> 00:54:43,619
And if we kissed
a little before?

631
00:54:43,790 --> 00:54:47,373
I think it will not make me
become wetter, so ...

632
00:54:47,544 --> 00:54:50,144
I'll just ...

633
00:55:16,239 --> 00:55:19,406
It's okay dear.
Only bad initially.

634
00:55:19,576 --> 00:55:23,028
It's what everyone says.

635
00:55:24,414 --> 00:55:28,033
- Try to relax.
- Yes ..

636
00:55:35,425 --> 00:55:38,095
Honey?
Honey?

637
00:55:38,261 --> 00:55:41,465
I'm here love.
I'm not going anywhere.

638
00:55:41,640 --> 00:55:45,590
- It's okay.
- Okay. Okay.

639
00:55:52,567 --> 00:55:55,853
Happy birthday, dear.

640
00:56:06,456 --> 00:56:10,240
- So a new plan?
- Yes, give me just a second.

641
00:56:10,419 --> 00:56:15,128
- Can I do anything?
- No, it's not with you.

642
00:56:15,299 --> 00:56:17,836
What are you thinking?

643
00:56:18,010 --> 00:56:21,210
I dunno ... Tit.

644
00:56:24,766 --> 00:56:30,271
I find it funny that Jessica's bitch
athlete is considered by jumping on horseback.

645
00:56:30,439 --> 00:56:35,231
- What's this?
- Riding.

646
00:56:35,402 --> 00:56:40,989
Riding. The horse is the athlete.
Does all the work.

647
00:56:41,158 --> 00:56:45,985
It seems like the Olympics, ran
100 m with the dwarves in the back ...

648
00:56:46,163 --> 00:56:49,662
... And then give the medals
the dwarves.

649
00:56:49,833 --> 00:56:53,000
Yes, it would be nice.

650
00:56:54,546 --> 00:56:58,959
- I'm not thinking about it.
- Okay.

651
00:56:59,134 --> 00:57:02,254
- Seriously.
- Okay.

652
00:57:03,680 --> 00:57:08,841
- Shall I ...?
- No. I'll handle it.

653
00:57:18,779 --> 00:57:23,239
Maybe we should stop here.

654
00:57:23,408 --> 00:57:28,651
I take the blame.
I thought it was a good idea but is not.

655
00:57:28,830 --> 00:57:32,662
How about shake hands
and blame the other?

656
00:57:32,834 --> 00:57:36,951
Not going anywhere. I would not want
remember this as something that did not work.

657
00:57:37,051 --> 00:57:38,566
I hate to give bad news, but ...

658
00:57:39,257 --> 00:57:42,125
The fault was not mine.
I was a little nervous.

659
00:57:42,225 --> 00:57:43,637
Everything you nervous.

660
00:57:43,804 --> 00:57:48,513
Everything? I was not eating you
twenty minutes?

661
00:57:48,684 --> 00:57:51,353
Just did it because he felt
I had to do.

662
00:57:51,520 --> 00:57:54,640
I know you. Only did so because he felt
bad because of the fiasco blowjob.

663
00:57:54,815 --> 00:57:59,642
Listen. Nobody eats
a woman's obligation.

664
00:57:59,820 --> 00:58:02,108
I know what you think.

665
00:58:02,281 --> 00:58:06,026
I'm not a whore, that in six years
unable to meet you.

666
00:58:06,340 --> 00:58:09,453
- I've known you for almost twenty years.
- Do not call her a whore.

667
00:58:09,553 --> 00:58:14,034
I know that plays the male, when
over, because if you call a coward.

668
00:58:14,209 --> 00:58:18,254
I know it touches my neck,
Dimitri said that because he played.

669
00:58:18,422 --> 00:58:20,757
I know all about you
you know everything about me ...

670
00:58:20,955 --> 00:58:24,844
That's why we can not harden it.
Where are my pants?

671
00:58:25,637 --> 00:58:28,161
You know I've been in love
for you?

672
00:58:28,265 --> 00:58:32,806
He knew, but I was
Morris or whoever it was.

673
00:58:35,105 --> 00:58:37,857
I've also been in love with you
but you did not know.

674
00:58:38,025 --> 00:58:42,603
Yes knew.
When I was with Jessica.

675
00:58:42,779 --> 00:58:45,733
Wait. Did you know?

676
00:58:47,784 --> 00:58:52,411
Now I leave it.
This should never have happened.

677
00:58:52,581 --> 00:58:56,281
I did not know you knew that.
Where are my pants?

678
00:58:56,460 --> 00:59:00,327
I thought we could do this, but ...

679
00:59:00,505 --> 00:59:04,717
Drop the fucking pants!

680
00:59:04,885 --> 00:59:09,262
A fuck, it's just a fuck.
Said this or not?

681
00:59:09,431 --> 00:59:13,215
- I said this or not?
- Do you want me to answer?

682
00:59:13,393 --> 00:59:17,605
We are excited, let's go!
Then we can be friends again ...

683
00:59:17,773 --> 00:59:20,702
... But now, for me,
you're just a piece of meat.

684
00:59:20,802 --> 00:59:23,863
- Only a "good proportion" with feet.
- Sensual ...

685
00:59:23,963 --> 00:59:27,314
And for you, I am lonely,
"Face with a huge cock."

686
00:59:27,491 --> 00:59:31,488
Together we can do this.
Go back to bed and start again.

687
00:59:31,662 --> 00:59:33,890
It should not be so hard.

688
00:59:34,268 --> 00:59:38,699
- But it is.
- No, if we meet like meat ...

689
00:59:38,877 --> 00:59:41,878
I mean, is ... Hard.

690
00:59:47,260 --> 00:59:50,464
You know what's going on here?
You know?

691
00:59:51,348 --> 00:59:53,638
- You are pointing at you.
- Oh is it?

692
00:59:54,160 --> 00:59:56,228
Wants you to return
to bed.

693
00:59:56,328 --> 00:59:59,976
If he could do so would.

694
01:00:00,148 --> 01:00:04,098
So go back to bed and let's have sex.
Nothing more.

695
01:00:04,278 --> 01:00:09,948
- I will not get involved with an idiot?
- I need to empty the balls.

696
01:00:10,117 --> 01:00:12,713
Just me and my "thing"
against you and your "thing"?

697
01:00:12,818 --> 01:00:15,008
Here is a nice fuck
with eyes ...

698
01:00:15,289 --> 01:00:17,749
Are you ready?

699
01:00:30,679 --> 01:00:35,279
<i>V - ORGASM </ i></i>

700
01:00:38,645 --> 01:00:44,434
- How are you darling?
- Well, well what about you?

701
01:00:44,610 --> 01:00:49,437
Great.
This vibrator is fantastic.

702
01:00:49,615 --> 01:00:53,280
- Can I go deeper?
- Know ...

703
01:00:53,452 --> 01:00:57,663
- Come on, deeper to the point G.
- So what?

704
01:01:02,336 --> 01:01:07,660
- And then, dear?
- Not bad.

705
01:01:07,760 --> 01:01:09,360
Oh dear.

706
01:01:19,061 --> 01:01:20,061
Okay.

707
01:01:21,118 --> 01:01:22,118
Okay.

708
01:01:22,344 --> 01:01:25,688
Wait. Stop.
Honey, honey.

709
01:01:25,859 --> 01:01:29,062
- It's coming.
- Honey, honey, honey.

710
01:01:53,595 --> 01:01:57,595
Why are you so slow?

711
01:02:01,144 --> 01:02:03,944
I do not know.

712
01:02:11,280 --> 01:02:14,280
Want it faster?

713
01:02:30,882 --> 01:02:36,007
Want it faster?
- Yes, maybe.

714
01:03:24,478 --> 01:03:27,099
- Good job.
- You too, partner.

715
01:03:27,272 --> 01:03:31,768
- Yes, yes.
- Do you like this, my bitch?

716
01:03:35,113 --> 01:03:40,190
- I'm almost there.
- Oh my God! Me too.

717
01:04:02,140 --> 01:04:05,225
You are so beautiful.

718
01:04:19,741 --> 01:04:21,636
- This is better than I thought.
- So good ...

719
01:04:21,741 --> 01:04:23,079
Oh my God, you're so good!

720
01:04:23,179 --> 01:04:25,946
- You are so beautiful.
- I love you.

721
01:04:26,469 --> 01:04:27,929
I love you too.

722
01:04:41,805 --> 01:04:45,719
Thank you.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

723
01:04:51,461 --> 01:04:55,561
- Damn! You were awesome.
- Me?

724
01:04:55,736 --> 01:05:01,441
Only once you've done and enjoy
you made me cum three times.

725
01:05:01,617 --> 01:05:06,693
- My goodness ...
- So, any note?

726
01:05:06,872 --> 01:05:11,249
Well had a thing,
that was a bit much.

727
01:05:11,418 --> 01:05:14,787
- Really?
- You know what I mean.

728
01:05:14,963 --> 01:05:17,692
- Was ...
- Shut up.

729
01:05:17,792 --> 01:05:19,520
Well you can reduce it a bit.

730
01:05:20,218 --> 01:05:25,349
- Nobody believes. Exhibitionist too.
- I'll try to remember next time.

731
01:05:26,078 --> 01:05:29,678
- You know what I can do for me?
- What?

732
01:05:29,853 --> 01:05:31,976
Oh no, dear ...
I'm still recovering.

733
01:05:32,147 --> 01:05:34,899
Can not approach.
I'm so sensitive.

734
01:05:35,067 --> 01:05:38,233
- You know what I would love?
- What?

735
01:05:38,403 --> 01:05:42,318
A bowl of ice cream
with a biscuit.

736
01:05:42,491 --> 01:05:46,239
You can put the bowl in the microwave
and warm up a bit ..

737
01:05:46,411 --> 01:05:50,623
Want an ice cream cone is nice!

738
01:05:50,791 --> 01:05:55,785
- May have to wash a bowl.
- I serve the ice cream and wash the cup.

739
01:05:55,963 --> 01:05:58,964
- And to me?
- Trago.

740
01:05:59,383 --> 01:06:00,947
With a biscuit?

741
01:06:02,344 --> 01:06:06,211
Glad you made it.
What did you say?

742
01:06:06,390 --> 01:06:12,973
Of course I am happy by sex, all
men are equal but I'm happy ...

743
01:06:13,146 --> 01:06:18,354
I'll stop talking, because clearly
have the same opinion about this ...

744
01:06:20,070 --> 01:06:25,989
I hope it does not take to recover,
because I am ready to repeat.

745
01:06:34,126 --> 01:06:36,249
Forgot my biscuit.

746
01:06:38,588 --> 01:06:41,957
- Lift the leg.
- So?

747
01:06:42,134 --> 01:06:46,345
- Yes.
- Oh, yes. Oh my God!

748
01:06:46,513 --> 01:06:51,305
I think I'll enjoy.
I will enjoy!

749
01:06:51,476 --> 01:06:54,347
Here we go.
We did it.

750
01:06:54,521 --> 01:06:55,521
Look.

751
01:07:09,119 --> 01:07:14,077
Oh man, it was fantastic!
You are so sexy. Yes!

752
01:07:16,585 --> 01:07:21,710
Oh boy, I know we had some
disagreements, but ...

753
01:07:21,882 --> 01:07:25,682
... It was so good!

754
01:07:43,320 --> 01:07:50,532
I am leaving for a while.
If you need me ...

755
01:08:23,527 --> 01:08:27,607
A little juice.
Just this, that you leave me?

756
01:08:27,781 --> 01:08:33,024
So I have to go buy another
packaging? You think I'm stupid?

757
01:08:33,203 --> 01:08:37,450
- Think you're smarter than me?
- Please dress!

758
01:08:37,624 --> 01:08:42,224
<i>VI - FINAL </ i></i>

759
01:08:43,422 --> 01:08:47,550
I did not hear the "ding" of the microwave.

760
01:08:47,718 --> 01:08:52,925
I'm confused.
She was massaging?

761
01:08:53,098 --> 01:08:58,061
- He said he enjoyed four times.
- I know I said.

762
01:08:58,395 --> 01:09:02,253
- I was lying?
- I was not lying. I just ...

763
01:09:03,817 --> 01:09:04,817
What?

764
01:09:06,862 --> 01:09:10,729
I can not reach orgasm.

765
01:09:10,907 --> 01:09:18,369
I try, I try. Do you have any
something wrong with me.

766
01:09:19,041 --> 01:09:23,749
Should be a fun thing
and casual ...

767
01:09:23,920 --> 01:09:25,920
It is not.

768
01:09:26,298 --> 01:09:31,505
For me it's so overwhelming and staff.

769
01:09:31,678 --> 01:09:35,345
I can not. I keep
think of my picture ...

770
01:09:35,555 --> 01:09:38,683
As he thinks of me,
which my smell ...

771
01:09:39,102 --> 01:09:44,523
And I can not.
I can not enjoy.

772
01:09:47,611 --> 01:09:54,064
I think I am not a person
very sensual.

773
01:09:56,912 --> 01:09:58,112
Sorry.

774
01:10:01,291 --> 01:10:03,865
Really sorry.

775
01:10:04,628 --> 01:10:07,428
It'll be fine.

776
01:10:12,219 --> 01:10:17,047
So ... When you say
is not very sexy ...

777
01:10:19,267 --> 01:10:22,221
It's a lie.
It is a crazy lie.

778
01:10:22,396 --> 01:10:26,061
Not too sexy?
You're lying.

779
01:10:26,233 --> 01:10:29,981
Fuck. Do not get so angry
because he could not give me an orgasm.

780
01:10:30,153 --> 01:10:35,824
That's not why I'm angry. Has
many girls that I enjoy many.

781
01:10:36,535 --> 01:10:40,698
- I believed you, Jamie.
- This is not my name. It's Dora.

782
01:10:40,872 --> 01:10:47,409
But Dora would ruin my sensuality
so I decided to say it was Jamie.

783
01:10:47,587 --> 01:10:50,505
Changed his name to Jamie Fox?

784
01:10:50,674 --> 01:10:55,834
What? It is a sexy name. How would
guess who would win those Oscars?

785
01:10:56,013 --> 01:10:58,613
You're crazy!

786
01:10:59,349 --> 01:11:03,976
Sure, it's folly to lie, to take
someone to bed. Never the right.

787
01:11:04,146 --> 01:11:10,647
I know all about you. I know you like
certain things so fake, what then?

788
01:11:10,819 --> 01:11:13,191
Wanted to be fucked.

789
01:11:13,363 --> 01:11:18,820
Not figured it was a lazy
I would try to love me. What was that?

790
01:11:18,994 --> 01:11:21,699
How could he come up with that?

791
01:11:21,872 --> 01:11:26,617
You're not the man I have heard.
You're a fucking hypocrite.

792
01:11:26,793 --> 01:11:32,132
Goes around lecturing,
and putting his dick in everything around you?

793
01:11:32,299 --> 01:11:38,254
And then come here to spread crap
all over my apartment ...

794
01:11:38,430 --> 01:11:41,514
... And still call me a liar?

795
01:11:41,683 --> 01:11:47,722
You did not say a word not
had to do with their sexual prowess.

796
01:11:59,076 --> 01:12:01,483
- Hello
- Was it good?

797
01:12:01,662 --> 01:12:04,449
- No, no.
- So it was bad?

798
01:12:04,623 --> 01:12:09,534
No, it was boring.
This shit is just lies.

799
01:12:09,711 --> 01:12:13,460
Never again.
Swear to God. Never again.

800
01:12:13,632 --> 01:12:16,232
Not worth it?

801
01:12:23,371 --> 01:12:23,971
Hey

802
01:12:28,355 --> 01:12:33,694
- Do not you hear me?
- It was great.

803
01:12:33,860 --> 01:12:36,861
I said, wait.
I said, stop.

804
01:12:38,031 --> 01:12:40,231
I said, no.

805
01:12:44,955 --> 01:12:47,355
Look at you!

806
01:12:47,916 --> 01:12:54,417
Sorry. I was close and
it seemed that he enjoyed it.

807
01:12:54,589 --> 01:12:57,211
- It does not matter.
- No?

808
01:12:57,384 --> 01:13:01,547
It's the principle. A woman
orders to stop, and we stopped.

809
01:13:01,722 --> 01:13:06,882
This was to be closer.
To do something exciting together.

810
01:13:07,060 --> 01:13:11,438
But you went inside again. Not me
heard ... He pretended that I was not even there.

811
01:13:11,606 --> 01:13:17,146
- Bet you thought about Ian Ziering.
- Andrew. Did you?

812
01:13:18,697 --> 01:13:24,036
- I think it does not matter.
- But he enjoyed like crazy.

813
01:13:24,202 --> 01:13:29,078
How do you know? I was too busy ...
Thinking I had a stick ... Wavy!

814
01:13:29,249 --> 01:13:33,329
I know because I felt.

815
01:13:33,503 --> 01:13:34,903
Really?

816
01:13:36,089 --> 01:13:39,489
Felt when I came.

817
01:13:40,927 --> 01:13:45,755
Therefore, and because it has
sperm everywhere.

818
01:13:57,569 --> 01:14:03,690
Not bad! But the best,
was so excited to see you.

819
01:14:03,867 --> 01:14:06,572
Can not remember the last
time I saw you so.

820
01:14:06,745 --> 01:14:10,695
And you were doing
new noises.

821
01:14:13,961 --> 01:14:16,915
- Honey ...
- Yes ..?

822
01:14:17,089 --> 01:14:19,793
I'm not tired.

823
01:14:19,967 --> 01:14:23,549
- Is that a question?
- No. I'm saying.

824
01:14:25,639 --> 01:14:28,212
I'm also not tired.

825
01:14:39,194 --> 01:14:43,239
- I forgot. Can we ...?
- Yes I'm sorry.

826
01:15:04,761 --> 01:15:05,961
So ...

827
01:15:12,686 --> 01:15:15,094
I thought that was what
you wanted.

828
01:15:15,272 --> 01:15:20,230
Wanted. I want to.
You were awesome, baby.

829
01:15:20,402 --> 01:15:23,438
- I love you so much.
- I know.

830
01:15:23,614 --> 01:15:25,014
I know.

831
01:15:26,658 --> 01:15:31,071
You know?
She did all this for you.

832
01:15:31,246 --> 01:15:35,458
No, no, no. We talked about it.
She was so excited as I am.

833
01:15:35,626 --> 01:15:41,462
- She wanted as much as I do.
- Just wanted to make you happy.

834
01:15:41,632 --> 01:15:44,917
- I just wanted to make you happy.
- You make me happy.

835
01:15:45,093 --> 01:15:48,263
Please. Do not do it.
Let's look at me.

836
01:15:48,472 --> 01:15:50,549
I do not deserve a girl
like you.

837
01:15:50,649 --> 01:15:54,852
When we left, it's as if to say:
"What is she doing with that guy?"

838
01:15:55,020 --> 01:15:57,262
Do not tell me not to notice.
I quite see.

839
01:15:57,439 --> 01:16:03,940
Just wanted to say what he deserves. See you
happy. So excited me so much.

840
01:16:04,112 --> 01:16:08,774
Dear. When I see people
in the street looking like this ...

841
01:16:08,951 --> 01:16:12,117
You notice. I knew it.

842
01:16:12,287 --> 01:16:16,499
Yes, repair and adore.

843
01:16:16,667 --> 01:16:20,082
It makes me feel,
I have this wonderful secret.

844
01:16:20,253 --> 01:16:24,797
As if he knew that nobody else knows.
You is the right guy for me.

845
01:16:24,967 --> 01:16:30,423
Look at this guy.
It has a firm ass, a nice nose ...

846
01:16:30,597 --> 01:16:34,049
- And look at this shit!
- Could you please ...

847
01:16:34,226 --> 01:16:40,644
Yes It was nice and it's legal,
but I was always thinking of you.

848
01:16:42,734 --> 01:16:45,521
- Really?
- Yes.

849
01:16:46,530 --> 01:16:50,330
I am ... A pervert.

850
01:16:53,078 --> 01:16:56,447
- Me too.
- Me too.

851
01:16:56,623 --> 01:16:59,992
I love to steal shoes
people that the smell ...

852
01:17:00,168 --> 01:17:02,181
- I love you.
- My God! You're so sexy!

853
01:17:02,281 --> 01:17:03,256
I love you so much!

854
01:17:03,356 --> 01:17:06,541
- Honey, you're so hot!
- I've said it.

855
01:17:07,968 --> 01:17:11,384
I love you too, baby!

856
01:17:12,723 --> 01:17:16,139
- I do whatever I want.
- Everything?

857
01:17:16,310 --> 01:17:19,761
- I'll have you in every way.
- Yes?

858
01:17:19,938 --> 01:17:26,522
I'll grab, pull hair, you have!
I'll hold you, caress and make love!

859
01:17:26,695 --> 01:17:31,606
- As crazy as love!
- Yes

860
01:17:31,783 --> 01:17:35,152
It's very personal.
I think I'll go.

861
01:17:35,329 --> 01:17:37,529
Dave, wait.

862
01:17:40,500 --> 01:17:44,830
Sorry for ...
I do not want to be boring.

863
01:17:45,005 --> 01:17:46,405
I know.

864
01:17:47,633 --> 01:17:51,677
And I wanted to thank you,
by fuck my girlfriend. It was ...

865
01:17:52,554 --> 01:17:56,089
- Okay.
- No, no!

866
01:17:56,266 --> 01:17:59,600
Our cocks are
touching.

867
01:18:14,952 --> 01:18:17,621
So long, abnormal.

868
01:18:17,788 --> 01:18:20,457
Good night, pervert.

869
01:18:22,125 --> 01:18:25,925
So ... We are well?

870
01:18:27,047 --> 01:18:29,752
- Yes, you love me?
- Yes.

871
01:18:29,925 --> 01:18:32,214
- Will you give me?
- Oh, yes!

872
01:18:32,386 --> 01:18:39,516
- It's all for me?
- Everything, everything you want honey.

873
01:18:39,685 --> 01:18:45,141
You know?
I saw them holding each other there.

874
01:18:45,315 --> 01:18:49,858
And it was good. Good and sexy.

875
01:18:56,243 --> 01:19:01,284
I opened another bottle.
I did not know which to choose.

876
01:19:03,792 --> 01:19:06,544
- Toma.
- Thanks.

877
01:19:06,712 --> 01:19:09,000
- Health
- Health

878
01:19:11,508 --> 01:19:14,308
So is leaving?

879
01:19:14,553 --> 01:19:22,809
I do not want to impose too much.
I also have to work in the morning.

880
01:19:23,895 --> 01:19:27,015
- Okay. Follow you to the door.
- Yes.

881
01:19:27,190 --> 01:19:29,390
Yeah, okay.

882
01:19:32,613 --> 01:19:36,527
- Give my love to Jasmine.
- I send you.

883
01:19:36,700 --> 01:19:39,108
- Say hello to, Fuck Dog.
- Shut up!

884
01:19:43,624 --> 01:19:44,624
Okay.

885
01:19:57,638 --> 01:20:03,758
I can not call you for a while.
My work has been crazy.

886
01:20:03,935 --> 01:20:06,735
Yes, mine too.

887
01:20:15,489 --> 01:20:17,689
It was fun.

888
01:20:21,119 --> 01:20:21,719
Yes

889
01:21:38,989 --> 01:21:42,025
- Well ...
- Yes.

890
01:21:43,076 --> 01:21:46,611
- It was fun.
- Yes.

891
01:21:48,832 --> 01:21:51,240
Give me five!

892
01:21:56,798 --> 01:22:00,167
Man, I'm so drunk.

893
01:22:05,432 --> 01:22:06,832
Me too.

894
01:22:10,270 --> 01:22:13,141
Okay. Good night.

895
01:22:18,528 --> 01:22:21,980
Matt listens. Listen.
I said ...

896
01:22:22,157 --> 01:22:24,757
What is this?

897
01:22:25,577 --> 01:22:32,196
This? I do not know what it is.
Has a mess of CD's in the reader.

898
01:22:33,502 --> 01:22:37,998
Come on, tell.
I'm the biggest coward.

899
01:22:39,174 --> 01:22:42,377
I love this song.

900
01:22:45,263 --> 01:22:47,386
"You - ..?
- Yes.

901
01:22:51,561 --> 01:22:56,389
- I'm not drunk.
- Me neither.

902
01:22:58,819 --> 01:23:02,318
Sorry I called
your ex a slut.

903
01:23:02,489 --> 01:23:05,624
- She's a bitch.
- Just say it, because I said.

904
01:23:05,724 --> 01:23:06,701
It's nothing.

905
01:23:06,801 --> 01:23:11,915
He always says things and then I
say why you think it should say.

906
01:23:12,082 --> 01:23:14,288
I say nothing.

907
01:23:14,459 --> 01:23:19,002
Wait. You are talking about what
I said then you say ...?

908
01:23:19,172 --> 01:23:22,707
Because I felt what I said.
Do not say I felt because I felt.

909
01:23:22,884 --> 01:23:26,585
- Shut your mouth now.
- I have to say that I felt what I said.

910
01:23:26,763 --> 01:23:28,880
- Shut up.
- Shut up you.

911
01:23:28,985 --> 01:23:30,654
Matt. Stop talking.

912
01:23:31,768 --> 01:23:35,552
Ah ... Do you want ...?

913
01:23:35,731 --> 01:23:39,313
We can do something else.

914
01:23:40,944 --> 01:23:44,894
I can not think anymore.

915
01:24:04,617 --> 01:24:09,830
"Hey, wait. The movie is not over yet !..."
"In five minutes is over"

916
01:30:14,880 --> 01:30:15,880
Dave?

917
01:30:17,341 --> 01:30:20,959
Dave. Are you awake?

918
01:30:21,136 --> 01:30:23,336
Is not she?

919
01:30:24,598 --> 01:30:26,798
Cool, cool!
