2
00:00:02,063 --> 00:00:03,864
So, how long are you
guys gonna be here for?

3
00:00:03,898 --> 00:00:08,001
I have no idea. It's not really up to me.

4
00:00:08,036 --> 00:00:10,537
[Brandon] You're not jealous, are you?

5
00:00:10,571 --> 00:00:11,755
Of Callie? No.

6
00:00:11,789 --> 00:00:12,906
[jesus] I don't think this is a good idea.

7
00:00:12,940 --> 00:00:14,741
[Lexi] 'Cause of Mariana?

8
00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:15,926
Do you honestly think
that she's gonna care?

9
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:17,711
I know she is. She told me.

10
00:00:17,745 --> 00:00:20,897
[Lexi] So that's it? We're just
gonna do whatever mariana wants?

11
00:00:20,932 --> 00:00:24,718
I want everyone to write
about guilt in their journals.

12
00:00:24,752 --> 00:00:26,720
Don't worry. No one's gonna read it.

13
00:00:26,754 --> 00:00:28,622
<i>It's just for you to get in
the habit of writing every day.</i>

14
00:00:28,656 --> 00:00:31,792
- She read my journal!
- No, I didn't!

15
00:00:31,826 --> 00:00:34,461
You wrote about Liam?

16
00:00:34,495 --> 00:00:36,763
I have to write a story, and
I need a name for the bad guy.

17
00:00:36,798 --> 00:00:38,765
How about Liam?

18
00:00:47,899 --> 00:00:50,701
[in Spanish]

19
00:00:50,735 --> 00:00:52,769
Whoa, leave yourself some
room to breathe, sweetheart.

20
00:00:52,804 --> 00:00:54,938
- Come on, I don't need to breathe.
- Yes, you do.

21
00:00:54,973 --> 00:00:56,607
Do you think the top is too... 

22
00:00:56,641 --> 00:00:57,040
- Busty?
- Boring?

23
00:00:57,075 --> 00:00:58,709
Right?

24
00:00:58,743 --> 00:01:00,644
<i>- You should jewel it.
- Ah, si.</i>

25
00:01:00,678 --> 00:01:02,813

26
00:01:02,847 --> 00:01:05,849
<i>- Un poco.
- Por favor, mama?</i>

27
00:01:05,884 --> 00:01:08,719
Gosh, ok.

28
00:01:08,753 --> 00:01:09,786

30
00:01:17,896 --> 00:01:19,563
Como?

31
00:01:19,597 --> 00:01:22,499
She's asking if your
father's tie is going to match

32
00:01:22,533 --> 00:01:24,501
with your dress for the
father-daughter dance.

33

00:01:26,738 --> 00:01:29,740
<i>Ah, que bueno.</i>

35
00:01:29,774 --> 00:01:33,777
<i>Uh, so you can dance with a padrino or... </i>

36
00:01:33,811 --> 00:01:36,713
<i>a close friend de la familia.</i>

37
00:01:36,748 --> 00:01:40,450
She's dancing with her moms. Right?

38
00:01:41,452 --> 00:01:43,487
Oh.

39
00:01:43,521 --> 00:01:45,555
[Stef] Hey! Sorry, I'm late!

40
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:47,824
Hi, sweetie.

41
00:01:47,859 --> 00:01:52,629
So, oh my goodness, you
look beautiful, sweetheart!

42
00:01:56,601 --> 00:01:59,603
- [laughing]
- Did you see her face

43
00:01:59,637 --> 00:02:01,571
when Stef walked up in her uniform?

44
00:02:01,606 --> 00:02:03,373
Hilarious.

45
00:02:03,408 --> 00:02:04,641
<i>I hate when people say "bueno,"</i>

46
00:02:04,676 --> 00:02:06,743
like you need their approval for something.

47
00:02:06,778 --> 00:02:08,512
When you tell people that
you have a mom and dad,

48
00:02:08,546 --> 00:02:10,547
they don't say, "How wonderful."

49
00:02:10,581 --> 00:02:11,834
Who cares?

50
00:02:11,835 --> 00:02:14,085
I wish I had two moms
throwing me a quinceanera.

51
00:02:14,552 --> 00:02:17,587
My parents refuse and we're Latino.

52
00:02:17,622 --> 00:02:20,490
I mean, so are you, but
you know what I mean.

53
00:02:20,525 --> 00:02:22,559
Yeah, totally.

54
00:02:22,593 --> 00:02:24,594
I just want this to be like, the party that

55
00:02:24,629 --> 00:02:28,265
everybody talks about for
the whole rest of high school.

56
00:02:28,299 --> 00:02:29,566
You know what you need... 

57
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:32,369
- Three hundred dollars?
- Shh.

58
00:02:32,403 --> 00:02:35,372
For a dress she's only going to wear once?

59
00:02:35,406 --> 00:02:37,607
We'll cut it short and
she can wear it to prom.

60
00:02:37,642 --> 00:02:39,576
We're spending a fortune on this party.

61
00:02:39,610 --> 00:02:42,312
It's not just a party, and we
already set this money aside.

62
00:02:42,347 --> 00:02:44,414
Yes, before we had two more mouths to feed.

63
00:02:44,449 --> 00:02:47,551
Love, I'm just asking can
we just rein it in, please?

64
00:02:47,585 --> 00:02:51,254
Did you talk to her about
the Kelsey situation?

65
00:02:51,289 --> 00:02:54,291
- Yes, I did.
- And how did that go?

66
00:02:54,325 --> 00:02:57,227
So, Lexi and I were talking... 

67
00:02:57,261 --> 00:02:59,463
can we get a bubble machine for the party?

68
00:02:59,497 --> 00:03:01,264
- No.
- Sure.

69
00:03:03,501 --> 00:03:05,469
- Sure.
- Yes.

Make them thinner than that, sweetheart... 

80
00:03:50,214 --> 00:03:52,449
I'm just making sure you
have Mariana's playlist... 

81
00:03:52,483 --> 00:03:56,319
- Good job, buddy.
- ... nothing too provocative or
with any explicit lyrics.

82
00:03:56,354 --> 00:04:00,290
- What's for dinner?
- Not chips, my friend.

83
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:04,261
Hey, can Talya stay for dinner?

84
00:04:04,295 --> 00:04:06,430
- Ooh, Lexi, too?
- Sure.

85
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:11,468
Hey Callie, how was your day?

86
00:04:11,502 --> 00:04:14,404
Uh, it was good.

87
00:04:14,439 --> 00:04:19,509
Uh, so Callie, you know my friend Kelsey?

88
00:04:19,544 --> 00:04:23,480
Oh, the one who lied and
said I sold her drugs?

89
00:04:23,514 --> 00:04:27,250
- Yeah, well she's in rehab.
- I'm sorry to hear that.

90
00:04:28,453 --> 00:04:31,288
So, do you want to take
her place in my court?

91
00:04:31,322 --> 00:04:34,458
I think that is a great idea, Mariana.

92
00:04:34,492 --> 00:04:38,328
Um, what do you think, Callie?

93
00:04:38,362 --> 00:04:44,134
- Uh, sure, I guess.
- [Stef] Great.

94
00:04:44,168 --> 00:04:46,336
We'll just have to hurry and get
your gown fitted before Saturday.

95
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:50,140
- I have to wear a gown?
- [chuckles]

96
00:04:50,174 --> 00:04:53,310
Well, you don't have to do anything.

97
00:04:53,344 --> 00:04:56,279
- And we get to do a waltz.
- It's gonna be fun.

98
00:04:56,314 --> 00:04:58,381
- Like eating glass.
- Hey, shut it.

99
00:04:58,416 --> 00:05:01,251
So, who does Callie get to dance with?

100
00:05:01,285 --> 00:05:03,186
Brandon.

101
00:05:04,422 --> 00:05:08,391
Yeah, I mean, but... you're my date.

102
00:05:08,426 --> 00:05:12,028
Well, duh. [giggles]

103
00:05:19,103 --> 00:05:22,205
- Hey, B? Hey.
- Yeah?

104
00:05:22,273 --> 00:05:25,408
Everything ok with you and Talya?

105
00:05:25,443 --> 00:05:30,013
- Yeah, why wouldn't it be?
- I don't know, just... 

106
00:05:31,482 --> 00:05:33,250
Brandon, listen.

107
00:05:33,284 --> 00:05:36,153
You know that, I'm assuming
that you know that... 

108
00:05:36,187 --> 00:05:42,025
well, you know, foster
siblings are not allowed to... 

109
00:05:42,059 --> 00:05:45,061
Hook up? I don't know what
you guys call it these days?

110
00:05:45,096 --> 00:05:46,463
There's nothing going
on between Callie and I.

111
00:05:46,497 --> 00:05:49,499
- Callie and me.
- Yeah, ok.

112
00:05:49,534 --> 00:05:52,502
It's just, when the twins
got here you were nine.

113
00:05:52,537 --> 00:05:54,371
- Right, and now I'm a horny teenager.
- Yes.

114
00:05:54,405 --> 00:05:56,206
Hm.

115
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:59,009
Mom, I have a girlfriend
and I know the rules.

116
00:05:59,043 --> 00:06:01,044
- Ok.
- Ok.

117
00:06:02,386 --> 00:06:06,089
Will you do me a favor and
take these to your brother?

118
00:06:06,123 --> 00:06:10,327
Tell him to please stop leaving
his crap around the house.

119
00:06:10,361 --> 00:06:13,029
- Crap is not a bad word.
- It's not a nice word.

120
00:06:13,064 --> 00:06:15,232
Well, give me a word to say then.

121
00:06:15,266 --> 00:06:19,002
[both sighing deeply]

122
00:06:19,036 --> 00:06:21,004
How's your mom?

123
00:06:21,038 --> 00:06:22,372
- She's fine.
- Yeah?

124
00:06:22,406 --> 00:06:25,008
She's taking a shuttle
from the airport tomorrow.

125
00:06:25,042 --> 00:06:27,043
Well, that's good. That'll help us, right?

126
00:06:27,078 --> 00:06:29,012
Yeah, what would help us is
if she wasn't coming at all.

127
00:06:29,046 --> 00:06:30,914
Oh, my gosh.

128
00:06:30,948 --> 00:06:33,950
I'll never understand why
Dana stresses you out so much.

129
00:06:33,985 --> 00:06:35,986
She's nothing but lovely to me.

130
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:37,153
You're not her daughter.

131
00:06:37,188 --> 00:06:39,256
Speaking of daughters,

132
00:06:39,290 --> 00:06:43,126
I think ours might be
feeling a little embarrassed.

133
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:44,828
About what?

134
00:06:44,862 --> 00:06:47,964
About dancing with us at her party.

135
00:06:47,999 --> 00:06:49,833
Did she say something to you?

136
00:06:49,867 --> 00:06:54,804
- No.
- Well, stop projecting.

137
00:06:54,839 --> 00:06:57,974
Mariana's always been
very proud of us, really.

138
00:06:58,009 --> 00:07:00,176
She's fine.

139
00:07:03,914 --> 00:07:07,784
Should I have Mariachi? [speaks
Spanish] That's traditional.

140
00:07:07,818 --> 00:07:10,053
So is having a Catholic mass
and you're not doing that.

141
00:07:10,087 --> 00:07:11,921
Yeah, true.

142
00:07:13,724 --> 00:07:15,759
What about the shoe ceremony?

143
00:07:15,793 --> 00:07:17,127
- Uh-uh. No.
- A doll thing?

144
00:07:18,162 --> 00:07:20,930
My mom's going to be here any minute.

145
00:07:20,965 --> 00:07:22,766
I'm going to go use the ladies' room.

146
00:07:23,968 --> 00:07:25,869
The ladies' room?

147
00:07:31,075 --> 00:07:35,712
Hey, so I know your moms

148
00:07:35,746 --> 00:07:37,981
made you ask me to be in your party.

149
00:07:38,015 --> 00:07:40,984
So, I can tell them I don't want to do it.

150
00:07:41,018 --> 00:07:43,887
I don't know. Whatever.
If you don't want to.

151
00:07:43,921 --> 00:07:45,822
No, it's not that I don't want to.

152
00:07:45,856 --> 00:07:47,557
It's if you don't want me to.

153
00:07:47,591 --> 00:07:49,693
I don't mind.

154
00:07:49,727 --> 00:07:53,630
- You know, you don't have to.
- No, I know I don't have to.

155
00:07:53,664 --> 00:07:56,833
Ok, well, it's up to you.

156
00:07:56,867 --> 00:08:02,505
Ok. Well, then yeah. But
I don't know how to waltz.

157
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:03,840
Well, neither do I.

158
00:08:03,874 --> 00:08:05,575
A friend of our moms is teaching us.

159
00:08:05,609 --> 00:08:08,478
Cool.

160
00:08:10,748 --> 00:08:11,881
Cool.

161
00:08:18,556 --> 00:08:19,889
- I'm in here.
- Hey!

162
00:08:19,924 --> 00:08:21,758
- You didn't lock the door?
- I'm sorry.

163
00:08:21,792 --> 00:08:23,626
I hate sneaking around like this.

164
00:08:23,661 --> 00:08:26,429
- But, it's kind of hot.
- I mean it.

165
00:08:26,464 --> 00:08:28,398
Fine, let's tell her now.

166
00:08:28,432 --> 00:08:29,733
Not before her party.

167
00:08:35,406 --> 00:08:36,539
After.

168
00:08:36,574 --> 00:08:38,608
I shouldn't even be doing this.

169
00:08:38,642 --> 00:08:40,477
- Yes, you should.
- I have to go home.

170
00:08:40,511 --> 00:08:42,545
- I have to go home.
- No, you do not.

171
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:45,815
Go. Go before Mariana thinks I fell in.

172
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,601
- Hey.
- Hey.

173
00:09:04,635 --> 00:09:06,503
I just wanted to say goodnight to you guys.

174
00:09:06,537 --> 00:09:09,672
And Jude, thank you so much for helping
out with dinner, you did a great job.

175
00:09:09,707 --> 00:09:11,341
Thanks.

176
00:09:11,375 --> 00:09:15,478
- Night, Mom.
- Hey you, Jesus Foster.

177
00:09:15,513 --> 00:09:20,350
You're being a real sport
about Mariana's party, eh?

178
00:09:20,384 --> 00:09:22,442
You're a good brother. It's ok. 

179
00:09:22,445 --> 00:09:25,255
Just as long as I'm the one who
gets the car when we turn 16.

180
00:09:25,289 --> 00:09:28,591
- Yeah, that's gonna happen.
- Yeah, what he said.

181
00:09:28,626 --> 00:09:31,294
All right, goodnight you guys.

182
00:09:31,328 --> 00:09:34,164
- Thanks for dinner.
- Yeah, of course.

183
00:09:38,602 --> 00:09:42,205
- What?
- Nothing.

184
00:09:47,278 --> 00:09:50,146
- Hey, where's Callie?
- Bathroom.

185
00:09:50,181 --> 00:09:53,183
Oh, those look fantastic,
sweetheart. Good job.

186
00:09:53,217 --> 00:09:55,385
All right, goodnight, lovely.

187
00:09:55,419 --> 00:09:57,487
Mm. Don't stay up late, ok?

188
00:09:57,521 --> 00:10:00,290
- Ok, goodnight, Mom.
- Oh... 

189
00:10:00,324 --> 00:10:03,193
Hey, listen, you know,
Mama said something to me,

190
00:10:03,227 --> 00:10:05,028
and I just wanted to check in with you.

191
00:10:05,062 --> 00:10:08,298
You're not embarrassed to dance
with us at your party, are you?

192
00:10:38,626 --> 00:10:42,796
That's a sad lunch, but I
guess it beats prison food.

193
00:10:42,830 --> 00:10:45,065
Really? That's your opening line?

194
00:10:45,099 --> 00:10:47,935
I was going to ask about your rap sheet,

195
00:10:47,969 --> 00:10:50,003
but I thought that was rude.

196
00:10:51,906 --> 00:10:53,874
That's where you're supposed to laugh,

197
00:10:53,908 --> 00:10:56,910
and you realize that we're
both outsiders who nobody gets.

198
00:10:56,945 --> 00:10:59,947
And then you get my name
tattooed on your neck,

199
00:10:59,981 --> 00:11:02,616
until it all goes terribly wrong,

200
00:11:02,650 --> 00:11:04,918
and you have to turn it into a snake

201
00:11:04,953 --> 00:11:09,690
just biting your earlobe.

202
00:11:09,724 --> 00:11:11,758
What do you want from me?

203
00:11:11,793 --> 00:11:14,494
What every guy wants.

204
00:11:14,529 --> 00:11:17,664
Stimulating conversation.

205
00:11:17,699 --> 00:11:21,702
And sex. That's probably
off the table, huh?

206
00:11:24,505 --> 00:11:25,806
Look at that smile.

207
00:11:28,610 --> 00:11:31,845
So, listen, some of us are
hanging out at the beach

208
00:11:31,879 --> 00:11:34,481
by the pier, Saturday
night, you should come.

209
00:11:34,549 --> 00:11:39,353
- I can't, I have a thing.
- What kind of thing.

210
00:11:39,387 --> 00:11:41,688
The kind that you'd make
fun of if I told you.

211
00:11:43,625 --> 00:11:46,493
When your thing gets boring... 

212
00:11:46,527 --> 00:11:48,395
you know where to find me.

213
00:11:55,670 --> 00:12:00,307
Don't be shy. Place your right
hand on your partner's waist.

214
00:12:02,277 --> 00:12:05,245
And slightly around to
the small of her back.

215
00:12:08,616 --> 00:12:11,285
Extend the left hand.

216
00:12:11,319 --> 00:12:12,653
Palm raised.

217
00:12:12,687 --> 00:12:15,522
Callie, rest your hand gently in his.

218
00:12:15,556 --> 00:12:19,559
Other hand, up on his shoulder like so.

219
00:12:19,594 --> 00:12:21,261
A little closer.

220
00:12:23,398 --> 00:12:24,564
Good, hold that position.

221
00:12:24,599 --> 00:12:28,468
In partner dancing, connection is key.

222
00:12:28,503 --> 00:12:33,140
So, Brandon and Callie,
look into each others eyes.

223
00:12:35,176 --> 00:12:36,376
Breathe.

224
00:12:36,411 --> 00:12:40,147
Connect. And you two.

225
00:12:41,482 --> 00:12:45,152
And over here. Right hand, on her waist.

226
00:12:45,219 --> 00:12:47,454
Left hand... 

227
00:12:50,224 --> 00:12:53,493
- [doorbell rings]
- Everyone? Gram's here!

228
00:12:55,096 --> 00:12:58,165
- Dana, you made it.
- Of course I made it.

229
00:12:58,199 --> 00:13:01,134
- Good to see you.
- Oh, hello beautiful.

230
00:13:01,169 --> 00:13:03,236
- Hi Mom.
- Oh, your skin looks good.

231
00:13:03,271 --> 00:13:05,726
You've been moisturizing,
but my God, you're pale.

232
00:13:05,727 --> 00:13:07,052
Baby, you need some sun.

233
00:13:07,128 --> 00:13:08,962
Yeah, but she's gorgeous. Look at her.

234
00:13:08,997 --> 00:13:10,364
Of course, she's gorgeous.

235
00:13:10,398 --> 00:13:14,334
- Gram!
- And there's my beautiful birthday girl.

236
00:13:14,369 --> 00:13:18,038
Oh, and my handsome birthday boy!

237
00:13:18,072 --> 00:13:20,107
Your grandfather's very
sorry he couldn't be here,

238
00:13:20,141 --> 00:13:21,975
but he got stuck in Paris at a conference.

239
00:13:22,010 --> 00:13:24,011
I wish I was stuck in Paris.

240
00:13:24,045 --> 00:13:27,848
You play your cards right
and I will take you one day.

241
00:13:27,882 --> 00:13:29,850
Where's my other dashing grandson?

242
00:13:29,884 --> 00:13:31,985
[Stef] Uh, practice.

243
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:35,122
Well... 

244
00:13:35,156 --> 00:13:39,126
you must be Callie.

245
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:42,162
- And you must be Jude.
- Yes, ma'am.

246
00:13:42,196 --> 00:13:45,198
- It's lovely to meet you both.
- Thanks.

247
00:13:45,233 --> 00:13:47,301
Everyone in this house calls me Gram.

248
00:13:47,335 --> 00:13:51,938
Guess what, I've got fabulous presents... 

249
00:13:51,973 --> 00:13:55,008
[chuckles, groans]

250
00:13:59,781 --> 00:14:02,749
Gotta be out the door in 15!

251
00:14:04,118 --> 00:14:07,054
- Wow.
- Wow yourself.

252
00:14:07,088 --> 00:14:09,122
Mm, we should dress up
for each other more often.

253
00:14:09,157 --> 00:14:11,892
- I know.
- Or you could check your email.

254
00:14:11,926 --> 00:14:13,894
Oh, I'm sorry... 

255
00:14:13,928 --> 00:14:16,063
Everything's done, sweetheart. Let it go.

256
00:14:16,097 --> 00:14:17,731
I just want her party to be perfect.

257
00:14:17,765 --> 00:14:18,899
She's going to be the center of attention.

258
00:14:18,933 --> 00:14:20,867
For Mariana, it don't
get no better than that.

259
00:14:20,902 --> 00:14:24,104
Ok, you guys need another bathroom.

260
00:14:24,138 --> 00:14:26,707
- You look lovely, Dana.
- You really do, Mom.

261
00:14:26,741 --> 00:14:28,809
Thank you. It's a miracle
because no black woman

262
00:14:28,843 --> 00:14:30,811
can tame the mane in 15 minutes.

263
00:14:30,845 --> 00:14:32,679
Luckily, you don't have that problem.

264
00:14:32,714 --> 00:14:34,815
Yeah, I don't exactly
just wake up like this.

265
00:14:34,849 --> 00:14:38,051
- Baby, that is a compliment.
- Ok, gift bags. Enough.

266
00:14:38,086 --> 00:14:39,786
It's good... it's good like that.

267
00:14:40,755 --> 00:14:42,856
Well, my you look handsome.

268
00:14:42,890 --> 00:14:45,759
Well, you too... pretty, I mean.

269
00:14:45,793 --> 00:14:47,661
Oh, right, I think.

270
00:14:47,695 --> 00:14:49,029
Help me with the gift bags.
Bring 'em out to the car.

271
00:14:49,063 --> 00:14:50,797
Thanks.

272
00:15:02,577 --> 00:15:05,579
- Uh, you need help?
- What?

273
00:15:06,714 --> 00:15:10,550
Oh, uh... no. I got it.

274
00:15:12,687 --> 00:15:14,488
You look... nice.

275
00:15:19,827 --> 00:15:21,628
- Hey.
- Hey.

276
00:15:21,662 --> 00:15:22,863
Look at you, hottie.

277
00:15:26,501 --> 00:15:27,601
Um... 

278
00:15:27,635 --> 00:15:31,872
Well, I should take these to the car.

279
00:15:35,910 --> 00:15:39,413
- You look pretty.
- You, too.

280
00:15:39,447 --> 00:15:42,516
It really is nice for Mariana
to ask you to be in her court.

281
00:15:42,550 --> 00:15:45,552
Seeing as how, you know,
this is a temporary situation.

282
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:50,557
Well, you never know. I mean,
they might decide to keep us.

283
00:15:50,591 --> 00:15:52,459
Maybe.

284
00:15:52,493 --> 00:15:54,628
- I mean, unless... 
- What?

285
00:15:54,662 --> 00:15:56,463
- They knew something.
- Something?

286
00:15:56,497 --> 00:15:58,732
Like what happened with Liam.

287
00:16:00,601 --> 00:16:02,702
You make it a habit of reading
other people's journals?

288
00:16:02,737 --> 00:16:05,272
Just people I don't trust.

289
00:16:06,441 --> 00:16:08,608
Going to go help Brandon.

290
00:16:08,643 --> 00:16:10,577
What's going on?

291
00:16:30,381 --> 00:16:33,450
Hey. You look nice.

292
00:16:33,484 --> 00:16:36,419
Oh, thank you. So do you.

293
00:16:36,454 --> 00:16:38,488
That Lena's one lucky lady, huh?

294
00:16:38,523 --> 00:16:41,424
- Ok.
- So, listen... 

295
00:16:41,459 --> 00:16:45,395
- I wanted to give you this.
- Child support? That's great.

296
00:16:45,429 --> 00:16:46,730
It's for Mariana. It's for the party.

297
00:16:46,764 --> 00:16:51,368
Look, I know this is costing you
guys a fortune and I asked around.

298
00:16:51,402 --> 00:16:53,537
It's tradition for friends and
family to help out with these things.

299
00:16:53,571 --> 00:16:57,641
It's very sweet, Mike. I really do
appreciate it, but we can't accept this.

300
00:16:57,675 --> 00:16:59,509
[chuckles] I'm not taking that.

301
00:16:59,544 --> 00:17:02,345
If you don't take it, I'm
going to be deeply offended.

302
00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:06,249
And you, of all people, should know
you don't want me deeply offended.

303
00:17:06,284 --> 00:17:08,418
- Well, thank you very much.
- Ok.

304
00:17:10,421 --> 00:17:12,489
Actually, Mike, there is
something that you could do for me.

305
00:17:12,523 --> 00:17:15,625
Um, I know it's last minute,
but Mariana has actually asked

306
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:18,628
if you would do the
father-daughter dance with her.

307
00:17:18,663 --> 00:17:20,530
- Really?
- Yeah.

308
00:17:20,565 --> 00:17:22,599
- Seriously, me?
- Yeah.

309
00:17:22,633 --> 00:17:26,203
Wow. Yeah, of course. I'd be honored.

310
00:17:26,237 --> 00:17:28,538
- Ok.
- I mean, you ok with that?

311
00:17:28,573 --> 00:17:31,141
Yeah, well, apparently
dancing with your two moms

312
00:17:31,175 --> 00:17:33,410
<i>is not exactly quince tradition, so... </i>

313
00:17:33,444 --> 00:17:36,246
just roll with the punches.

314
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:38,415
- What about Lena?
- Oh no, it's fine, really.

315
00:17:38,449 --> 00:17:41,518
We want her to have the party she
wants and this is what she wants.

316
00:17:41,552 --> 00:17:45,522
Ok, well, she's lucky to have you two.

317
00:17:45,556 --> 00:17:48,225
- You're great moms.
- That hurt to say, didn't it.

318
00:17:48,259 --> 00:17:51,428
No, not at all. Hey, look
at you in your penguin suit.

319
00:17:51,462 --> 00:17:53,463
- Huh?
- Never mind.

320
00:17:53,497 --> 00:17:56,132
If I'm going to cut a rug with Mariana,

321
00:17:56,167 --> 00:17:57,968
I'm going to need a little liquid courage.

322
00:17:58,002 --> 00:17:59,970
Ok.

323
00:18:00,004 --> 00:18:02,305
Wait, Mariana is dancing with Mike?

324
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:04,307
I thought she was dancing with you two.

325
00:18:04,342 --> 00:18:07,344
It's fine, Jesus. Will you please
finish up this table for me?

326
00:18:07,378 --> 00:18:09,946
Thanks, love.

327
00:18:10,014 --> 00:18:11,214
Ok.

328
00:18:15,319 --> 00:18:19,189
- [both giggling]
- You look like a princess.

329
00:18:19,223 --> 00:18:20,957
I feel like I'm going to throw up.

330
00:18:20,992 --> 00:18:23,059
What if it's no fun? What if
I trip and fall on my face?

331
00:18:23,094 --> 00:18:25,262
You won't, and it's going to be amazing.

332
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:32,002
- What is that?
- Your birthday present.

333
00:18:32,036 --> 00:18:33,236
I wanted you to open it first.

334
00:18:33,304 --> 00:18:35,071
Help me open it.

335
00:18:38,342 --> 00:18:40,010
[gasps]

336
00:18:40,044 --> 00:18:42,045
Oh, my God. Did you do this all yourself?

337
00:18:42,079 --> 00:18:44,114
[laughing]

338
00:18:44,148 --> 00:18:46,283
- Where did you get this picture?
- Your moms.

339
00:18:46,317 --> 00:18:49,185
- I loved that dress!
- She was new to our school

340
00:18:49,220 --> 00:18:52,822
and she wore this princess
dress every day for like a month.

341
00:18:52,857 --> 00:18:54,024
I was obsessed with Belle.

And by a white father.

518
00:29:51,079 --> 00:29:53,414
And I never felt accepted
by either community, Mom.

519
00:29:53,448 --> 00:29:55,283
Well, I'm so sorry if you had such a

520
00:29:55,317 --> 00:29:57,118
tough time being a beautiful
light skinned woman...

521
00:29:57,152 --> 00:30:00,054
- Oh, Mom...
- But like it or not,

522
00:30:00,088 --> 00:30:02,423
the color of your skin
has afforded you more

523
00:30:02,457 --> 00:30:07,028
opportunities than anyone
like me has ever had.

524
00:30:07,062 --> 00:30:08,996
That is what you've always assumed.

525

has made my life easier.

Because it has.

never know what it is like

doesn't want me here.

- I don't know.

But look, she's not
letting it ruin her party.

Ok, Jude? I'm not stupid, ok?

544

But sometimes you do stupid things.

I don't know what it's
like to be a black woman.

[groans] She's not right, you know that.

555

She's right about one thing,

556
00:32:00,504 --> 00:32:03,506
and that's why I wanted to
have this party for Mariana,

557
00:32:03,541 --> 00:32:05,408
and why I don't give a
damn how much it costs,

558
00:32:05,442 --> 00:32:07,443
