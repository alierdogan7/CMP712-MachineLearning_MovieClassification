Why didn't you tell me

- I'm not.
- I can respect that

to talk about it before,

my take is
that he's Jake-elous.

412

No doubt in my mind
that Matty's feeling insecure

413
00:16:11,342 --> 00:16:12,774
because you told Jake
about the maybe baby

- before you told him.
- How can you tell?

- What thing?

- A friendship?
- I guess, yeah.

Why is it not easy with me?

497

00:19:34,148 --> 00:19:36,748
the minute anything bad happens,
you're gonna run away.

499

Why would you think that?

500
00:19:38,452 --> 00:19:40,185

00:20:42,217 --> 00:20:44,116
I was totally ready
to do it with you,

525
00:20:44,118 --> 00:20:45,451
but I was waiting on something.

526
00:20:45,453 --> 00:20:46,786
Right now,
I am too excited to wait.

527
00:20:46,788 --> 00:20:47,887
What?

528
00:20:47,889 --> 00:20:50,900
- I'm ready, okay?
- Okay.
