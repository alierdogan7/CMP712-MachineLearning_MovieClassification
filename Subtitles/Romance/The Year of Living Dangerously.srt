1
00:02:05,432 --> 00:02:07,900
June 25, 1965.

2
00:02:08,968 --> 00:02:13,302
Dossier H-10: Hamilton, Guy.

3
00:02:13,373 --> 00:02:18,470
Born 1936,
under the sign of Capricorn.

4
00:02:18,545 --> 00:02:22,311
Occupation: Journalist with the
Australian Broadcasting Service.

5
00:02:23,450 --> 00:02:27,318
Jakarta. First assignment
as foreign correspondent.

6
00:02:44,537 --> 00:02:47,631
You're an enemy here, Hamilton,
like all Westerners.

7
00:02:48,541 --> 00:02:51,510
President Sukarno
tells the West to go to hell...

8
00:02:51,578 --> 00:02:54,638
and today Sukarno
is the voice of the Third World.

9
00:02:54,714 --> 00:02:56,682
- Where you get visa?
- Sydney.

10
00:03:04,524 --> 00:03:05,957
Something wrong with that?

11
00:03:11,297 --> 00:03:13,561
Mr. Hamilton? Mr. Hamilton?

12
00:03:14,734 --> 00:03:17,294
- Welcome to Indonesia.
- Thanks. You're...

13
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:19,270
Kumar, from Jakarta office.

14
00:03:19,339 --> 00:03:21,273
Hortono. Driver.

15
00:03:21,341 --> 00:03:24,003
- Where's Potter?
- Mr. Potter has gone. He left this.

16
00:03:24,077 --> 00:03:25,339
Where's he gone?

17
00:03:25,411 --> 00:03:27,436
Back to Australia.

18
00:03:27,514 --> 00:03:28,776
Please follow me.

19
00:03:39,225 --> 00:03:42,194
He was supposed to stay
and brief me.

20
00:03:42,262 --> 00:03:44,457
He said he was sorry.
His wife was sick.

21
00:03:44,531 --> 00:03:45,862
Of what? Him?

22
00:03:45,932 --> 00:03:48,628
No, of Jakarta, boss.

23
00:04:05,385 --> 00:04:07,046
Our first air-conditioned hotel.

24
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:10,089
Here, Americans and Europeans
pay to be kept cold.

25
00:04:16,496 --> 00:04:18,555
Who's this?

26
00:04:18,631 --> 00:04:19,893
CIA.

27
00:04:19,966 --> 00:04:22,366
Nah, he's an embassy office boy.
Look at him.

28
00:04:23,670 --> 00:04:25,934
You're both wrong.
He's the new A.B.S. Man.

29
00:04:26,005 --> 00:04:28,599
How did our diminutive friend
know that?

30
00:04:28,675 --> 00:04:30,609
That little twerp knows everything.

31
00:04:30,677 --> 00:04:32,201
Guy Hamilton, right?

32
00:04:33,279 --> 00:04:35,270
- Right.
- Billy Kwan.

33
00:04:35,348 --> 00:04:37,111
I did a lot of film work
for Potter.

34
00:04:37,183 --> 00:04:38,673
How do you do?

35
00:04:38,751 --> 00:04:40,946
I felt sorry for you.

36
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:43,921
Dumped in your first posting
without contacts.

37
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:47,289
Adrift, hoping to
bluff your way through.

38
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:48,918
Wally O'Sullivan, Sydney Herald.

39
00:04:48,995 --> 00:04:50,929
- Read your stuff.
- Mere trifles, dear boy.

40
00:04:50,997 --> 00:04:52,988
Kevin Condon,
photo journo for Theta.

41
00:04:53,066 --> 00:04:55,762
- And Pete Curtis, Washington Post.
- Hi.

42
00:04:55,835 --> 00:04:57,598
- Pleasant flight?
- Yeah, it was all right.

43
00:04:57,670 --> 00:04:59,661
- This your first overseas post?
- Yes, it is. Yeah.

44
00:05:00,874 --> 00:05:03,809
Pity about Potter takin' off.
Can be hard here without contacts.

45
00:05:03,877 --> 00:05:05,742
I'll survive.

46
00:05:09,349 --> 00:05:11,408
- Taxi, sir?
- No, thanks.

47
00:05:11,484 --> 00:05:14,078
You should take a taxi.
It's dangerous walking there.

48
00:05:16,222 --> 00:05:18,156
- Taxi, sir?
- No.

49
00:05:25,231 --> 00:05:29,133
Most of us become children again
when we enter the slums of Asia.

50
00:05:29,202 --> 00:05:33,332
Last night I watched you
walk back into childhood...

51
00:05:33,406 --> 00:05:36,398
in all its opposite intensities...

52
00:05:36,476 --> 00:05:40,640
laughter and misery,
the crazy and the grim...

53
00:05:40,713 --> 00:05:42,908
toy town and a city of fear.

54
00:05:46,452 --> 00:05:48,010
Hey, English, huh?

55
00:06:01,034 --> 00:06:02,524
Hey, capitalist.

56
00:06:02,602 --> 00:06:04,194
Is it always like that here?

57
00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:07,205
Don't take it personally.
You're just a symbol of the West.

58
00:06:08,107 --> 00:06:10,098
Feel more like a spittoon.

59
00:06:11,244 --> 00:06:14,213
- Where are we going?
- This is a little market for the poor.

60
00:06:18,918 --> 00:06:22,877
"And the people asked Him, saying,
'What shall we do then?"'

61
00:06:22,956 --> 00:06:25,015
- What's that?
- It's from Luke.

62
00:06:25,091 --> 00:06:26,615
Chapter 3, verse 10.

63
00:06:26,693 --> 00:06:30,686
"What then must we do?"
Tolstoy asked the same question.

64
00:06:30,763 --> 00:06:32,731
He wrote a book with that title.

65
00:06:32,799 --> 00:06:35,859
He got so upset
about the poverty in Moscow...

66
00:06:35,935 --> 00:06:38,768
that he went one night
into the poorest section...

67
00:06:38,838 --> 00:06:41,329
and just gave away
all his money.

68
00:06:42,709 --> 00:06:44,768
You could do that now.

69
00:06:44,844 --> 00:06:47,711
Five American dollars would be a fortune
to one of these people.

70
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:50,078
Wouldn't do any good.
Just be a drop in the ocean.

71
00:06:50,149 --> 00:06:54,017
Ah. That's the same conclusion
Tolstoy came to.

72
00:06:54,087 --> 00:06:56,885
- I disagree.
- What's your solution?

73
00:06:56,956 --> 00:07:01,723
Well, I support the view that you just
don't think about the major issues.

74
00:07:01,794 --> 00:07:05,127
You do whatever you can about
the misery that's in front of you.

75
00:07:05,198 --> 00:07:07,189
Add your light
to the sum of light.

76
00:07:08,935 --> 00:07:10,869
- You think that's naive?
- Yup.

77
00:07:10,937 --> 00:07:14,338
- It's all right. Most journalists do.
- We can't afford to get involved.

78
00:07:14,407 --> 00:07:16,341
Typical journo's answer.

79
00:07:17,477 --> 00:07:19,843
Good luck for tomorrow.
You'll need it.

80
00:07:19,912 --> 00:07:22,472
Go home. Get some sleep.

81
00:07:28,454 --> 00:07:30,718
Take the one behind me.

82
00:07:30,790 --> 00:07:34,556
You're ambitious, self-contained...

83
00:07:34,627 --> 00:07:39,724
moderate to conservative in politics,
and despite your naïveté...

84
00:07:39,799 --> 00:07:44,736
I sense a potential,
something immediately apparent.

85
00:07:44,804 --> 00:07:46,795
A possibility.

86
00:07:46,873 --> 00:07:49,000
Could you be the unmet friend?

87
00:08:08,327 --> 00:08:12,229
Boss, take off your sunglasses
when you go in.

88
00:08:12,298 --> 00:08:14,994
Palace guards say they can
tell assassin by his eyes.

89
00:08:54,841 --> 00:08:56,775
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

90
00:08:56,843 --> 00:08:58,105
Missed anything?

91
00:08:58,177 --> 00:09:01,806
Yeah, 63 minutes
of excruciating boredom.

92
00:09:01,881 --> 00:09:04,577
I got a feeling he's gonna make
a pronouncement this morning.

93
00:09:04,650 --> 00:09:06,777
Oh, really, Kevin?
What makes you say that?

94
00:09:06,853 --> 00:09:09,253
- Just a thought.
- Yeah?

95
00:09:09,322 --> 00:09:12,883
When a thought crosses your mind, it's
been on the shortest trip in Jakarta.

96
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:14,620
What happens next?

97
00:09:14,694 --> 00:09:16,628
Soon as Sukarno's finished breakfast,
we go up.

98
00:09:16,696 --> 00:09:20,962
- How do you know when he's finished?
- He throws his scraps to us.

99
00:09:24,003 --> 00:09:25,732
Sorry, chaps.
Age before beauty.

100
00:09:42,889 --> 00:09:44,823
One, two, three.
Testing, testing.

101
00:09:47,326 --> 00:09:49,294
It'll do his image a world of good.

102
00:09:49,362 --> 00:09:50,989
The president will act...

103
00:09:51,063 --> 00:09:54,260
- Of course I will...
- General?

104
00:09:54,333 --> 00:09:55,960
No, not now.

105
00:09:56,035 --> 00:09:57,969
Just come up here for a minute.

106
00:10:03,075 --> 00:10:05,942
Are you gonna leave the U.N. Or not?

107
00:10:06,012 --> 00:10:09,948
Korea respect Sukarno.
Not like...

108
00:10:10,016 --> 00:10:14,146
Let me put it this way. If you
don't leave, what are you gonna do?

109
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:16,154
Can I come to your place?

110
00:10:17,490 --> 00:10:19,424
If you leave the U.N.,
what are you gonna do?

111
00:10:19,492 --> 00:10:23,861
In short, Jakarta is a city where
the questions outnumber the answers...

112
00:10:23,930 --> 00:10:25,625
but one thing is certain:

113
00:10:25,698 --> 00:10:29,429
That Sukarno's tightrope shuffle
between the Communist P.K. I...

114
00:10:29,502 --> 00:10:31,197
and the right-wing military...

115
00:10:31,270 --> 00:10:35,639
is looking more precarious
as the hours tick by.

116
00:10:35,708 --> 00:10:39,644
This is Guy Hamilton
in Jakarta for A.B.S. News.

117
00:10:39,712 --> 00:10:42,237
- Is that all?
- What do you mean?

118
00:10:43,516 --> 00:10:46,542
- You could have written that from here.
- What about the tightrope image?

119
00:10:46,619 --> 00:10:49,281
Everyone else thinks Sukarno
is in control.

120
00:10:49,355 --> 00:10:52,620
Guy, that wasn't news.
It was travelogue.

121
00:10:52,692 --> 00:10:54,057
Sydney out.

122
00:11:05,738 --> 00:11:07,899
- Didn't like it, eh, boss?
- Stop callin' me boss.

123
00:11:11,043 --> 00:11:12,635
Sorry.

124
00:11:12,712 --> 00:11:14,179
Have one of these.

125
00:12:18,611 --> 00:12:21,876
- Why are you creepin' around?
- I'm sorry. I didn't hear you come in.

126
00:12:21,947 --> 00:12:23,676
- Geez.
- I keep equipment here.

127
00:12:23,749 --> 00:12:27,014
Potter gave me a key.
Do you want it back?

128
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:29,879
Huh! Keep it.

129
00:12:33,826 --> 00:12:35,817
- Did you get an interview today?
- What?

130
00:12:35,895 --> 00:12:38,830
- Did you get an interview?
- No, I didn't.

131
00:12:40,633 --> 00:12:42,567
You're in trouble.
Do you realize that?

132
00:12:42,635 --> 00:12:43,897
It's early days yet.

133
00:12:43,969 --> 00:12:46,961
All the top doors are shut
to Western journalists.

134
00:12:47,039 --> 00:12:49,974
- Curtis got an interview.
- Curtis and Wally have got reputations.

135
00:12:50,042 --> 00:12:53,671
They can't be ignored.
Your only way in is personal contacts.

136
00:12:53,746 --> 00:12:55,179
Potter sabotaged you.

137
00:12:56,749 --> 00:12:58,376
You want me to shoot myself?

138
00:13:05,758 --> 00:13:08,693
Ten years I've waited for this,
and if I mess it up...

139
00:13:08,761 --> 00:13:11,753
they'll send me back to the news room
in Sydney, and that's a graveyard.

140
00:13:15,634 --> 00:13:18,432
If you could get
any interview you want...

141
00:13:18,504 --> 00:13:21,200
excluding one with Sukarno,
who would it be?

142
00:13:22,274 --> 00:13:25,243
- The leader of the Communist Party.
- I'll get it.

143
00:13:25,311 --> 00:13:27,438
I can get you to him tomorrow.

144
00:13:28,514 --> 00:13:31,381
- He doesn't give interviews.
- He does when he needs to.

145
00:13:31,450 --> 00:13:34,442
He's a friend of mine.
I've already spoken to him about you.

146
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:37,421
- Why are you on speaking terms with...
- lf you want it...

147
00:13:37,490 --> 00:13:39,890
it's yours.

148
00:13:39,959 --> 00:13:42,154
It should make quite a stir
internationally.

149
00:13:43,963 --> 00:13:47,126
If you can get me to Aidit, I'll give
you all the film work you can handle.

150
00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:48,461
Exclusive.

151
00:13:50,369 --> 00:13:53,827
That's great, old man. That's what
I've always wanted, a real partnership.

152
00:13:54,573 --> 00:13:57,770
Why the break to me?
Why not Potter?

153
00:13:59,578 --> 00:14:01,011
I didn't like him.

154
00:14:03,916 --> 00:14:05,850
We'll make a great team.

155
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:10,184
You, for the words;
me, for the pictures.

156
00:14:10,256 --> 00:14:11,917
I can be your eyes.

157
00:14:16,362 --> 00:14:18,523
- Thank you very much, Mr. Aidit.
- Let's go, Guy!

158
00:14:18,597 --> 00:14:20,030
We'll keep in touch!

159
00:14:21,534 --> 00:14:23,468
I'll take this straight
to the airport.

160
00:14:23,536 --> 00:14:26,471
- You'll be rushing to catch the flight.
- I'll make it.

161
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:29,906
If you shot that out of focus,
I'll kill you.

162
00:14:29,975 --> 00:14:32,170
You worry about the words,
Hamilton.

163
00:14:33,646 --> 00:14:37,343
Identification: Guy Hamilton
in Jakarta. Lead-in for story.

164
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:41,947
Exclusive interview with head
of the Indonesian Communist Party.

165
00:14:42,021 --> 00:14:44,148
Piece begins in five seconds.

166
00:14:45,257 --> 00:14:48,192
"Sukarno has yielded to the
demands of Communist Party members...

167
00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:51,024
"in Indonesian cabinet that
a 'Fifth Force' is to be established."

168
00:14:51,096 --> 00:14:53,428
- That's bullshit!
- The worrying thing is...

169
00:14:53,499 --> 00:14:56,400
it's well-written bullshit,
and it's right here in my paper.

170
00:14:56,469 --> 00:14:58,869
My paper wants me to match it.

171
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:04,505
Here they are now.
Sir Guy and the Black Dwarf.

172
00:15:04,577 --> 00:15:06,272
Congratulations, Hamilton.

173
00:15:06,345 --> 00:15:08,609
You've squeezed the test match
into two columns.

174
00:15:09,949 --> 00:15:11,382
Sorry about that.

175
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:15,514
- Want a beer?
- Great.

176
00:15:16,589 --> 00:15:17,851
Ali!

177
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:24,361
You really think Sukarno's gonna let
the Commies have their own army?

178
00:15:24,430 --> 00:15:26,364
- That's what Aidit said.
- Aidit's lying.

179
00:15:26,432 --> 00:15:28,195
- Maybe.
- Why report it?

180
00:15:28,267 --> 00:15:31,065
- Maybe he isn't.
- You know why he let you interview him?

181
00:15:31,136 --> 00:15:32,694
No. Tell us, Pete.

182
00:15:32,771 --> 00:15:35,604
Because he knew a more experienced
journalist wouldn't have even filed it.

183
00:15:35,674 --> 00:15:37,005
Really, Pete?

184
00:15:37,076 --> 00:15:39,601
If Aidit told you he had a toothache,
you'd file it.

185
00:15:39,678 --> 00:15:43,079
You've been after him for months
trying to get him to tell you something.

186
00:15:43,148 --> 00:15:46,914
The story stinks, and you know it.
Sukarno's not stupid.

187
00:15:46,986 --> 00:15:49,420
He lets the Communists have arms, and
we'll have a civil war here tomorrow.

188
00:15:49,488 --> 00:15:51,422
- Yeah, that's right.
- There better not be.

189
00:15:51,490 --> 00:15:55,620
- I'm gettin' married in December.
- Don't lose any sleep over it.

190
00:15:55,694 --> 00:15:58,094
This story's bullshit,
and when I file...

191
00:15:58,163 --> 00:16:00,529
I'm gonna piss on it
from a great height, mate.

192
00:16:00,599 --> 00:16:02,794
You do that, buddy.
It's about the only...

193
00:16:03,936 --> 00:16:06,404
- Guy! No!
- Simmer down! Stop it!

194
00:16:06,472 --> 00:16:08,372
- Did you see that?
- Forget it.

195
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:10,374
Next time, pal.

196
00:16:11,343 --> 00:16:12,810
Jesus!

197
00:16:12,878 --> 00:16:14,812
I must confess, Hamilton...

198
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:18,782
that I probably would have infused it
with a little more skepticism...

199
00:16:18,851 --> 00:16:22,048
but bitter resentment won't prevent me
from admitting it was a good piece.

200
00:16:22,121 --> 00:16:24,817
Well done.
Now smile and shake hands.

201
00:16:36,902 --> 00:16:38,927
Beauty among the squalor.

202
00:16:39,004 --> 00:16:42,098
I took that with a 200 millimeter.
Got a natural elegance, haven't they?

203
00:16:43,809 --> 00:16:46,039
All I ever see you shoot are tits.

204
00:16:47,246 --> 00:16:49,840
Quit trying to sell us
the pursuit of abstract beauty...

205
00:16:49,915 --> 00:16:51,849
and admit you're a pervert.

206
00:16:51,917 --> 00:16:55,409
Billy, you're a professional.
Is that pornography or art?

207
00:16:55,487 --> 00:16:59,253
If it's in focus, it's pornography.
If it's out of focus, it's art.

208
00:16:59,325 --> 00:17:01,088
Definitely art. Mmm.

209
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:03,526
They really are
exquisite creatures, aren't they?

210
00:17:03,596 --> 00:17:07,123
Let me ask you something. I've
worried about this since you got here.

211
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:10,168
- What do you do for sex?
- You're worried about that?

212
00:17:10,235 --> 00:17:11,998
Whenever I hit the front page,
I get a hard-on.

213
00:17:12,071 --> 00:17:15,268
- So what do you do?
- I go up to the cemetery.

214
00:17:15,341 --> 00:17:17,002
Are you a necrophiliac?

215
00:17:18,410 --> 00:17:19,968
It's where the prostitutes hang out.

216
00:17:20,045 --> 00:17:21,512
Fantastic girls, Hamilton.

217
00:17:21,580 --> 00:17:23,980
Best value-for-your-money ass
in Asia.

218
00:17:24,049 --> 00:17:26,176
I'll take you up there
right now, huh?

219
00:17:26,251 --> 00:17:27,912
- Some other time.
- Wise man.

220
00:17:27,987 --> 00:17:30,785
- They're riddled with VD.
- You never heard of penicillin?

221
00:17:30,856 --> 00:17:33,051
You will love this action.

222
00:17:33,125 --> 00:17:35,355
You want to spend the night?
Costs you one dollar.

223
00:17:35,427 --> 00:17:37,657
Starvation's a great aphrodisiac.

224
00:17:37,730 --> 00:17:41,632
Keep it up, Billy. We'll just
nail you to the old cross, huh?

225
00:17:43,035 --> 00:17:44,798
He can afford to be virtuous.

226
00:17:44,870 --> 00:17:47,771
He's holding hands
with the best-lookin' chick in town.

227
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:49,330
She's a friend.

228
00:17:49,408 --> 00:17:51,433
Sure she is, Billy.

229
00:17:51,510 --> 00:17:54,377
You'd find that kind of relationship
hard to understand.

230
00:17:54,446 --> 00:17:55,913
Get me the nails.

231
00:17:55,981 --> 00:17:58,643
I'm gonna hang the little bastard up
right now.

232
00:17:58,717 --> 00:18:01,277
You've been holdin' out on me.

233
00:18:01,353 --> 00:18:03,150
Here we are. Come on.

234
00:18:04,089 --> 00:18:06,114
Not too much, Hamilton.
Take it easy.

235
00:18:08,293 --> 00:18:10,591
All right. That's enough.

236
00:18:10,663 --> 00:18:14,622
Hey, Billy, grab one of these.
Go on! Go on.

237
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:17,498
Come on. Out of the way.
We're trying to eat here.

238
00:18:19,171 --> 00:18:21,230
You ever have these?
This stuff is terrific.

239
00:18:22,808 --> 00:18:24,901
I want you to meet your new best friend.
I bought him for you.

240
00:18:27,146 --> 00:18:28,477
Dance for my pal.

241
00:18:29,815 --> 00:18:31,783
- Do a dance for my pal.
- Okay.

242
00:18:42,461 --> 00:18:46,056
- Get him outta here.
- I bought him for you, pal.

243
00:18:54,473 --> 00:18:56,566
He's yours.
He goes wherever you go.

244
00:19:06,452 --> 00:19:08,010
Oh, God.

245
00:19:13,258 --> 00:19:16,056
- It was just a joke.
- Just a joke.

246
00:19:16,128 --> 00:19:18,062
- Hey, Wally...
- Forget it.

247
00:19:18,130 --> 00:19:20,655
- Sorry.
- Billy, it was a joke.

248
00:19:22,868 --> 00:19:24,426
Forget it.

249
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:30,174
Billy, what's that weird noise?

250
00:19:30,242 --> 00:19:33,507
It's the bamboo,
but there is a spirit here.

251
00:19:33,579 --> 00:19:35,604
I hear him outside at night.

252
00:19:36,715 --> 00:19:40,481
He came inside one night and spilled
some bottles of developer.

253
00:19:40,552 --> 00:19:43,612
- Do you really believe that stuff?
- Absolutely, old man.

254
00:19:43,689 --> 00:19:45,623
The unseen is all around us...

255
00:19:45,691 --> 00:19:47,852
particularly here in Java.

256
00:19:54,433 --> 00:19:55,627
G'day, sport.

257
00:19:55,701 --> 00:19:56,759
G'day.

258
00:19:56,835 --> 00:19:58,769
One of us.

259
00:20:03,642 --> 00:20:06,839
Air-conditioning, huh? I thought you
were living like the people.

260
00:20:06,912 --> 00:20:09,938
I keep a lot of film stock here.
It's kinder to it.

261
00:20:10,015 --> 00:20:11,346
Kinder to you too, eh?

262
00:20:11,416 --> 00:20:16,479
Okay, okay. But everything else here
is your basic Indonesia.

263
00:20:23,328 --> 00:20:26,525
A normal man
of normal intelligence...

264
00:20:26,598 --> 00:20:28,589
capable of having
normal children...

265
00:20:28,667 --> 00:20:30,464
but whose body is a joke.

266
00:20:32,204 --> 00:20:34,331
But the one great advantage
of being a dwarf...

267
00:20:34,406 --> 00:20:37,705
is that you can be wiser than
other people and no one envies you.

268
00:20:38,844 --> 00:20:40,436
You're not a dwarf.

269
00:20:42,047 --> 00:20:43,981
That's what I like
about you, Guy.

270
00:20:46,985 --> 00:20:48,714
You don't care, do you?

271
00:20:50,088 --> 00:20:52,079
Or maybe you just don't see.

272
00:20:55,127 --> 00:20:57,220
- Want some tea?
- Love some.

273
00:21:21,687 --> 00:21:23,154
This picture of Sukarno...

274
00:21:23,222 --> 00:21:25,156
- It's me.
- It's you. Yeah.

275
00:21:25,224 --> 00:21:26,691
I dressed for the part.

276
00:21:28,093 --> 00:21:31,688
He's quite a hero of mine.
I think he's a genius.

277
00:21:32,965 --> 00:21:35,832
He's really trying to do
something for his people.

278
00:21:35,901 --> 00:21:37,562
To them, he's a god.

279
00:21:47,112 --> 00:21:48,704
That's the real Jakarta.

280
00:21:50,115 --> 00:21:53,710
Scrounging for handfuls of rice
to keep alive another day.

281
00:21:53,785 --> 00:21:57,277
That's a story you journos
don't tell in your reports.

282
00:21:57,356 --> 00:22:00,086
- Nobody wants to hear it.
- Tell them anyway.

283
00:22:03,061 --> 00:22:05,154
Why don't you exhibit these?

284
00:22:05,230 --> 00:22:08,165
I don't care about the photographs.
I care about the content.

285
00:22:08,233 --> 00:22:10,201
I'm not very aesthetically minded.

286
00:22:10,269 --> 00:22:13,397
That explains all those
terrible shirts you get around in.

287
00:22:19,144 --> 00:22:20,577
You like my puppets?

288
00:22:20,646 --> 00:22:22,614
If you want to understand Java...

289
00:22:22,681 --> 00:22:24,979
you have to understand
the wajang...

290
00:22:25,050 --> 00:22:26,642
the sacred shadow play.

291
00:22:26,718 --> 00:22:28,652
The puppet master was a priest.

292
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:31,211
That's why they call Sukarno
the great puppet master...

293
00:22:31,290 --> 00:22:33,815
balancing the left
with the right.

294
00:22:35,861 --> 00:22:40,423
Their shadows are souls,
and the screen is heaven.

295
00:22:40,499 --> 00:22:42,558
You must watch their shadows...

296
00:22:42,634 --> 00:22:44,431
not the puppets.

297
00:22:44,503 --> 00:22:48,462
The right in constant struggle
with the left.

298
00:22:48,540 --> 00:22:52,067
The forces of light and darkness
in endless balance.

299
00:22:52,144 --> 00:22:54,977
In the West, we want answers
for everything.

300
00:22:55,047 --> 00:22:58,312
Everything is right or wrong
or good or bad.

301
00:22:58,383 --> 00:23:02,547
But in the wajang, no such
final conclusions exist.

302
00:23:04,022 --> 00:23:05,717
Look at Prince Arjuna.

303
00:23:07,225 --> 00:23:08,658
He's a hero.

304
00:23:09,828 --> 00:23:13,161
But he can also be fickle
and selfish.

305
00:23:13,231 --> 00:23:15,597
Krishna says to him...

306
00:23:15,667 --> 00:23:19,535
"All is clouded
by desire, Arjuna...

307
00:23:19,604 --> 00:23:21,936
"as a fire by smoke...

308
00:23:22,007 --> 00:23:24,407
"as a mirror by dust.

309
00:23:24,476 --> 00:23:27,934
"Through these,
it blinds the soul."

310
00:23:28,847 --> 00:23:30,678
Pretty good stuff.

311
00:23:32,184 --> 00:23:35,381
This is the Princess Srikandi.

312
00:23:35,454 --> 00:23:39,083
Noble and proud but headstrong.

313
00:23:39,157 --> 00:23:41,455
Arjuna will fall in love with her.

314
00:23:44,563 --> 00:23:46,121
Who's this one?

315
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:49,633
He's very special.

316
00:23:50,535 --> 00:23:52,696
The dwarf, Semar.

317
00:23:54,206 --> 00:23:55,673
What does he do?

318
00:23:56,408 --> 00:23:58,000
He serves the prince.

319
00:24:06,084 --> 00:24:07,608
That's my Jilly.

320
00:24:12,224 --> 00:24:14,419
There's someone
you should get to know.

321
00:24:14,493 --> 00:24:17,223
- Who?
- The chap with the mustache.

322
00:24:17,295 --> 00:24:18,887
He's British military attaché.

323
00:24:20,365 --> 00:24:22,299
- Colonel.
- Ah, Kwan.

324
00:24:22,367 --> 00:24:23,959
This is Guy Hamilton from A.B.S.

325
00:24:24,036 --> 00:24:25,663
- Colonel Ralph Henderson.
- How are you?

326
00:24:25,737 --> 00:24:27,898
Been listening to your broadcasts.

327
00:24:27,973 --> 00:24:29,998
- More interesting than your predecessor.
- Thank you.

328
00:24:30,075 --> 00:24:31,167
Jilly.

329
00:24:31,243 --> 00:24:33,211
Billy, what are you doing here?

330
00:24:33,278 --> 00:24:36,304
- You never come to the pool.
- I brought someone to meet you.

331
00:24:36,381 --> 00:24:38,474
- Really?
- I knew I'd find you here.

332
00:24:41,353 --> 00:24:44,686
This is my special friend,
Jilly Bryant. Guy Hamilton.

333
00:24:45,891 --> 00:24:48,416
- Drinks all around?
- Yes, please.

334
00:24:48,493 --> 00:24:51,018
Gin and tonics for everyone?

335
00:24:51,096 --> 00:24:52,688
- Four.
- Yes, sir.

336
00:24:52,764 --> 00:24:55,426
You're staying at the hotel?
You're lucky. It's delightful.

337
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:58,799
We're at the ambassador's residence
since the locals destroyed our embassy.

338
00:24:58,870 --> 00:25:01,896
- I hear they tore the place apart.
- Yes, they seemed to have fun.

339
00:25:01,973 --> 00:25:05,033
- It was all rather droll.
- It was anything but droll.

340
00:25:05,110 --> 00:25:07,772
Didn't some clown keep playing
the bagpipes the whole time?

341
00:25:07,846 --> 00:25:10,041
That was Ralph.

342
00:25:11,783 --> 00:25:13,648
It helped the morale.

343
00:25:17,255 --> 00:25:19,189
I bet you're counting
the days now, Jilly.

344
00:25:19,257 --> 00:25:21,521
- Oh, three weeks.
- 'Til what?

345
00:25:21,593 --> 00:25:23,356
- 'Til I go home.
- Where's that?

346
00:25:23,428 --> 00:25:26,158
- London.
- Had enough of the tropics?

347
00:25:26,231 --> 00:25:29,166
I've been on the move five years.
I'd like to go someplace and stay.

348
00:25:33,905 --> 00:25:35,497
Oh, here are the drinks.

349
00:25:37,542 --> 00:25:40,340
- What's this?
- Gin and tonic, sir.

350
00:25:40,412 --> 00:25:43,347
- Gin, tonic and ice.
- Gin and tonic always with ice, sir.

351
00:25:43,415 --> 00:25:45,508
Gin and tonic
does not always have ice.

352
00:25:45,584 --> 00:25:47,484
- Americans always use ice.
- Ralph.

353
00:25:47,552 --> 00:25:49,349
- Get me another.
- I'll take it.

354
00:26:01,333 --> 00:26:03,801
- Who's for a swim?
- Not me.

355
00:26:03,869 --> 00:26:06,303
I promised myself
an afternoon of laziness.

356
00:26:06,371 --> 00:26:09,534
- How about you, Jilly?
- No. I've only just come out.

357
00:26:09,608 --> 00:26:11,576
- Come in again.
- No.

358
00:26:11,643 --> 00:26:13,611
Stay here. Keep Billy company.

359
00:26:14,946 --> 00:26:18,143
- Hamilton, I'll give you a race.
- A race?

360
00:26:18,216 --> 00:26:20,377
You Australians are supposed to be
able to swim, aren't you?

361
00:26:20,452 --> 00:26:23,853
I hope you're fit.
When Ralph says race, he means it.

362
00:26:23,922 --> 00:26:25,890
There's no sense being halfhearted.

363
00:26:25,957 --> 00:26:28,824
Games are a serious business
with the English. Right, Colonel?

364
00:26:28,894 --> 00:26:30,418
They have their place.

365
00:26:32,063 --> 00:26:35,055
- Come on, Hamilton.
- Is he serious?

366
00:26:35,133 --> 00:26:36,532
All right.

367
00:26:37,602 --> 00:26:39,069
Wish me luck.

368
00:26:44,876 --> 00:26:46,309
What do you think?

369
00:26:47,212 --> 00:26:49,237
- About what?
- Hamilton.

370
00:26:49,314 --> 00:26:51,248
Oh. Cheeky.

371
00:27:02,227 --> 00:27:04,161
Come on, Colonel.
Keep pace.

372
00:27:04,229 --> 00:27:06,891
- Paddle!
- Come on, Ralph!

373
00:27:06,965 --> 00:27:08,728
Don't turn back now.

374
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:11,325
Up the A.B.S., Hamilton!

375
00:27:13,138 --> 00:27:14,696
Go, go, go.

376
00:27:16,074 --> 00:27:18,668
Well done, Ralph.

377
00:27:18,743 --> 00:27:20,768
The nearest anyone's
come to beating him.

378
00:27:20,845 --> 00:27:23,905
- He had you worried, didn't he, Colonel?
- Indeed he did.

379
00:27:23,982 --> 00:27:25,415
Congratulations.

380
00:27:28,653 --> 00:27:30,848
I find we have
something else in common.

381
00:27:31,923 --> 00:27:34,391
We are divided men.

382
00:27:34,459 --> 00:27:36,927
Your father, American;
mine, Chinese.

383
00:27:37,996 --> 00:27:40,931
We're not really certain
we're Australian, you and I.

384
00:27:42,567 --> 00:27:44,899
We're not quite at home
in the world.

385
00:28:10,662 --> 00:28:12,527
Oh, thanks.

386
00:28:12,597 --> 00:28:13,859
Tiger Lily?

387
00:28:14,766 --> 00:28:16,757
What's the matter with him?

388
00:28:16,835 --> 00:28:19,702
He's having troubles
with the military.

389
00:28:19,771 --> 00:28:21,261
What sort of trouble?

390
00:28:23,608 --> 00:28:25,633
His father has a small shop.

391
00:28:25,710 --> 00:28:27,610
Each week the military comes
to ask for money.

392
00:28:27,679 --> 00:28:30,113
He has no more money,
and he's afraid.

393
00:28:37,255 --> 00:28:39,485
No, boss. I'm not
looking for handouts.

394
00:28:39,557 --> 00:28:41,525
I get more than that each week...

395
00:28:41,593 --> 00:28:43,322
exchanging dollars
on the black market.

396
00:28:44,229 --> 00:28:46,220
Don't be stupid, Kumar.
Keep the dough.

397
00:28:54,272 --> 00:28:56,433
For my father,
I'll play the beggar.

398
00:28:58,076 --> 00:29:00,101
- American embassy.
- Who is it?

399
00:29:00,178 --> 00:29:01,611
P.K.I.

400
00:29:02,681 --> 00:29:04,911
- Got the Bell and Howell loaded?
- Chockablock.

401
00:29:04,983 --> 00:29:06,678
Any hairs on the lens?

402
00:29:06,751 --> 00:29:09,276
You worry about the words.
I'll take care of the pictures.

403
00:29:09,354 --> 00:29:12,517
See that you do.
Hey, you, come on. You're driving.

404
00:29:13,425 --> 00:29:15,893
Me... me driving?

405
00:29:38,717 --> 00:29:39,706
Camera!

406
00:29:56,167 --> 00:29:58,192
P.K.I. Demand complete break
with America.

407
00:29:58,269 --> 00:30:00,169
They're getting pretty confident,
aren't they?

408
00:30:00,238 --> 00:30:01,705
They have a lot of support.

409
00:30:02,607 --> 00:30:03,733
Enough to take over?

410
00:30:04,809 --> 00:30:05,833
Perhaps.

411
00:30:13,318 --> 00:30:14,649
P.K.I.!

412
00:30:33,705 --> 00:30:34,797
Camera!

413
00:30:36,174 --> 00:30:38,472
At least they would
give us discipline.

414
00:30:38,543 --> 00:30:40,534
Stalin had good discipline.

415
00:30:40,612 --> 00:30:42,739
He wiped out ten million.

416
00:30:44,749 --> 00:30:47,115
Hey, Hortono.
Take us up closer to the gates.

417
00:32:41,099 --> 00:32:43,727
- Christ, what do we do now?
- I think we get out.

418
00:32:47,839 --> 00:32:50,330
Better not, boss! Boss!

419
00:32:58,783 --> 00:33:00,717
Up! Hamilton, get me up!

420
00:33:03,121 --> 00:33:05,021
You don't take no photo!

421
00:33:05,089 --> 00:33:06,886
- No photo!
- Foreign press!

422
00:33:06,958 --> 00:33:08,892
- Foreign press!
- Don't take no photo!

423
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:10,450
Australian press!

424
00:33:11,362 --> 00:33:12,420
Get off him!

425
00:33:13,665 --> 00:33:14,996
Get back here!

426
00:33:17,168 --> 00:33:19,136
- Come on!
- Let go, you bastard!

427
00:33:19,203 --> 00:33:20,295
Oh, shit!

428
00:33:21,673 --> 00:33:23,698
Get out!

429
00:33:28,479 --> 00:33:30,879
Get back!

430
00:33:30,949 --> 00:33:32,439
Bastards!

431
00:33:33,518 --> 00:33:35,645
Shit! The bastard cut me!

432
00:33:42,527 --> 00:33:45,155
- Are you all right?
- Yeah. Did you get the shot?

433
00:33:45,229 --> 00:33:46,560
Yes!

434
00:33:54,105 --> 00:33:55,902
Is that all right?

435
00:33:55,974 --> 00:33:57,236
Yeah, fine.

436
00:34:00,411 --> 00:34:02,402
What do you think of her?

437
00:34:03,514 --> 00:34:04,913
Who?

438
00:34:07,919 --> 00:34:09,352
Not my type.

439
00:34:09,420 --> 00:34:11,354
Oh. Why's that?

440
00:34:12,957 --> 00:34:15,949
It's her attitude. You know how
the British can be so damn superior?

441
00:34:16,027 --> 00:34:18,291
It's like the colonel
with his gin, tonic and ice.

442
00:34:18,363 --> 00:34:21,196
- Jill is not like that at all.
- No?

443
00:34:21,265 --> 00:34:23,199
Who's that
in the photograph with her?

444
00:34:23,267 --> 00:34:26,964
Philippe. He's a French journalist.
He was working here for a while.

445
00:34:30,608 --> 00:34:33,509
- Were they, uh...
- Yeah, they were.

446
00:34:33,578 --> 00:34:37,674
Then he got transferred. It's difficult
for a woman like Jilly here.

447
00:34:37,749 --> 00:34:39,114
Why?

448
00:34:39,183 --> 00:34:41,811
Every guy she meets
wants to get her into bed.

449
00:34:41,886 --> 00:34:44,252
And it's your job
to keep 'em at bay?

450
00:34:46,924 --> 00:34:48,289
Sorry.

451
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:51,294
I asked her to marry me once.

452
00:34:52,030 --> 00:34:53,463
She turned me down.

453
00:35:00,004 --> 00:35:01,972
What about the colonel?

454
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:04,099
I don't know.
She's fond of him.

455
00:35:04,175 --> 00:35:06,405
You gotta watch that sort of thing
in the tropics.

456
00:35:06,477 --> 00:35:08,240
I'm gonna get you
a penicillin tablet.

457
00:35:09,313 --> 00:35:11,406
I guess I'll survive. Thanks.

458
00:35:23,795 --> 00:35:25,660
What is all this stuff?

459
00:35:34,005 --> 00:35:35,267
Thank you.

460
00:35:38,976 --> 00:35:40,773
- Who you workin' for, Billy?
- For you.

461
00:35:40,845 --> 00:35:43,177
- The Communists? The CIA?
- Stop it.

462
00:35:43,247 --> 00:35:45,181
Why do you keep a file on me?

463
00:35:45,249 --> 00:35:46,910
- I keep files on everybody.
- What for?

464
00:35:46,984 --> 00:35:48,178
That's my business.

465
00:35:48,252 --> 00:35:49,879
- Lf you're an operative...
- I'm not.

466
00:35:49,954 --> 00:35:51,751
How am I supposed to know that?

467
00:35:51,823 --> 00:35:54,223
You're gonna have to trust me,
aren't you?

468
00:36:01,065 --> 00:36:02,362
We're friends, aren't we?

469
00:36:04,135 --> 00:36:06,729
We make a good team.
We even look alike.

470
00:36:08,072 --> 00:36:10,199
It's true.
It's been noticed.

471
00:36:10,274 --> 00:36:12,538
We got the same color eyes.

472
00:36:14,312 --> 00:36:17,770
Here. Take one of these
every four hours.

473
00:36:30,895 --> 00:36:34,331
Here, on the quiet page,
I'm master...

474
00:36:34,398 --> 00:36:36,798
just as I'm master
in the darkroom...

475
00:36:36,868 --> 00:36:40,668
stirring my prints
in the magic developing bath.

476
00:36:40,738 --> 00:36:44,299
I shuffle like cards
the lives I deal with.

477
00:36:44,375 --> 00:36:46,400
Their faces stare out at me.

478
00:36:46,477 --> 00:36:49,810
People who will become
other people.

479
00:36:49,881 --> 00:36:53,817
People who will become old,
betray their dreams...

480
00:36:54,485 --> 00:36:55,816
become ghosts.

481
00:39:17,662 --> 00:39:19,220
Ibu?

482
00:39:21,232 --> 00:39:24,030
Doctor. Ibu, doctor.

483
00:39:24,101 --> 00:39:25,693
You understand?

484
00:39:46,624 --> 00:39:48,683
Can't make her understand
that the canal...

485
00:39:48,759 --> 00:39:52,354
which she and Udin bathe in
and drink from carries disease.

486
00:39:53,364 --> 00:39:56,891
In another country,
she would be a decent woman.

487
00:39:56,968 --> 00:40:00,267
Here she begs
and perhaps sells herself.

488
00:40:01,639 --> 00:40:04,938
Her tragedy is repeated
a million times in this city.

489
00:40:06,210 --> 00:40:08,144
"What then must we do?"

490
00:40:09,213 --> 00:40:13,980
"We must give with love to whomever
God has placed in our path."

491
00:40:16,387 --> 00:40:18,582
- What is it?
- What's the big occasion?

492
00:40:18,656 --> 00:40:21,591
Gentlemen,
an important announcement.

493
00:40:21,659 --> 00:40:25,595
I have secured me
a portion of Indonesia.

494
00:40:25,663 --> 00:40:27,824
So have I. She's waiting
for me in my room.

495
00:40:27,898 --> 00:40:31,595
A beachhead of tranquility,
a private domain, a haven.

496
00:40:31,669 --> 00:40:34,467
I have taken me a bungalow.

497
00:40:34,538 --> 00:40:37,098
- What?
- A bungalow?

498
00:40:37,174 --> 00:40:39,870
- What'd you do that for?
- Nobody lives here.

499
00:40:41,779 --> 00:40:44,111
Let's see how long you last in this...

500
00:40:59,330 --> 00:41:01,264
Where is your drink?
Come along.

501
00:41:09,907 --> 00:41:11,966
Up!

502
00:41:12,043 --> 00:41:13,567
Who do I look like?

503
00:41:13,644 --> 00:41:15,976
A Chinese-Australian
in a pitji cap.

504
00:41:16,047 --> 00:41:17,742
That's right!

505
00:41:17,815 --> 00:41:19,578
I'll say one thing for you.

506
00:41:19,650 --> 00:41:21,845
Anglo-Saxons are better...

507
00:41:21,919 --> 00:41:24,080
in the tropics!

508
00:41:24,889 --> 00:41:28,120
Anglo-Saxons better in the tropics

509
00:41:28,192 --> 00:41:30,387
Anglo-Saxons are better
in the tropics

510
00:41:34,565 --> 00:41:36,157
Let's hit it, baby.

511
00:42:07,898 --> 00:42:09,525
They were hollowed out.

512
00:42:23,848 --> 00:42:26,908
Hello, Peter.
Are you enjoying the party?

513
00:42:26,984 --> 00:42:30,385
- Mora... Merva...
- Moira. Moira.

514
00:42:37,962 --> 00:42:40,692
I'd enjoy it a lot more if we
got outta here. What do you say?

515
00:42:40,764 --> 00:42:42,994
- What?
- Hold this, will you, Pete?

516
00:42:43,067 --> 00:42:44,329
Thanks, mate.

517
00:42:46,937 --> 00:42:48,598
Cut a rug, Kevin.

518
00:42:52,209 --> 00:42:54,473
Wanna dance?
Come on. Let's dance.

519
00:43:16,700 --> 00:43:18,497
Oops! I'm sorry.

520
00:43:28,479 --> 00:43:32,210
Anglo-Saxons
are better in the tropics

521
00:43:32,283 --> 00:43:34,046
Anglo-Saxons...

522
00:43:38,689 --> 00:43:40,623
You spoil me, Hadji.

523
00:43:40,691 --> 00:43:42,625
I would never do that.

524
00:44:07,318 --> 00:44:09,616
- Curfew time.
- Oh, no.

525
00:44:09,687 --> 00:44:11,814
Come on. One more.
Let's put a record on.

526
00:44:16,794 --> 00:44:18,022
- Hello.
- Hello.

527
00:44:18,095 --> 00:44:20,154
- Enjoying yourself?
- Let's see here.

528
00:44:20,231 --> 00:44:22,165
- Hmm. And you?
- Fine.

529
00:44:23,434 --> 00:44:25,402
- Do you know Sri?
- Yes. How do you do?

530
00:44:25,469 --> 00:44:27,835
Colonel Henderson,
this is Jill, uh, Bryant...

531
00:44:27,905 --> 00:44:29,031
and Billy Kwan.

532
00:44:29,106 --> 00:44:30,698
Heard your piece on Lombok.

533
00:44:30,774 --> 00:44:32,935
- Interesting.
- Interesting?

534
00:44:33,010 --> 00:44:36,741
Yes, you're still young enough
and brave enough to speculate.

535
00:44:38,616 --> 00:44:41,210
The Lombok famine
wasn't exactly speculation.

536
00:44:43,687 --> 00:44:45,120
I'll get my coat.

537
00:44:45,189 --> 00:44:48,158
Let me hear it, Jill.
What did you think?

538
00:44:48,225 --> 00:44:50,785
I found it
a bit melodramatic.

539
00:44:51,862 --> 00:44:54,695
That's only my opinion.
My flatmate was moved to tears.

540
00:44:54,765 --> 00:44:56,198
So there you are.

541
00:44:57,301 --> 00:44:59,963
What does it take
to move you to tears?

542
00:45:07,478 --> 00:45:09,105
- Curfew.
- Good night.

543
00:45:09,179 --> 00:45:10,441
Good night.

544
00:45:13,317 --> 00:45:15,877
Right, everyone. Curfew.

545
00:45:29,266 --> 00:45:30,858
So it begins.

546
00:45:35,973 --> 00:45:37,235
Jesus!

547
00:45:39,176 --> 00:45:40,609
- Put it back.
- But, boss...

548
00:45:40,678 --> 00:45:42,612
I like the challenge.
Put it back.

549
00:45:54,858 --> 00:45:57,122
- Hello. Is Billy here?
- No, I'm sorry.

550
00:45:57,194 --> 00:45:59,287
He hasn't been in all day.

551
00:45:59,363 --> 00:46:02,332
- We were to meet here and go for lunch.
- Maybe he's on his way.

552
00:46:02,399 --> 00:46:03,889
Unless he's later than I am.

553
00:46:06,770 --> 00:46:09,261
You wanna stick around and wait for him?
You want a coffee?

554
00:46:09,340 --> 00:46:10,898
No, thank you.
I've interrupted you.

555
00:46:10,974 --> 00:46:13,442
I'm glad you did.
It's been a high-wastage day.

556
00:46:19,316 --> 00:46:21,250
If Billy does come back...

557
00:46:21,318 --> 00:46:23,149
tell him I've gone back
to the embassy.

558
00:46:23,220 --> 00:46:25,188
You got a car?

559
00:46:25,255 --> 00:46:27,815
- I'll take a taxi.
- I can give you a lift if you like.

560
00:46:27,891 --> 00:46:29,825
That's all right.
I can get a taxi.

561
00:46:29,893 --> 00:46:32,726
I really did wanna get hold
of Billy myself.

562
00:46:32,796 --> 00:46:34,957
Maybe we could drive over
to his place and wait there.

563
00:46:35,032 --> 00:46:36,499
He's bound to turn up.

564
00:46:38,669 --> 00:46:41,832
- I'll get my jacket.
- In back of the door.

565
00:46:41,905 --> 00:46:44,499
Boss? Have you forgotten?
The circuit to Sydney.

566
00:46:44,575 --> 00:46:46,509
- What time?
- 2:00.

567
00:46:46,577 --> 00:46:48,545
The Subandrio piece.
It's not important. Cancel it.

568
00:46:48,612 --> 00:46:50,546
- What about Priok?
- Ah, Jesus.

569
00:46:50,614 --> 00:46:52,514
- You have to be there by 3:00.
- 4:00.

570
00:46:52,583 --> 00:46:54,949
- 3:00, boss.
- Okay, I'll make it.

571
00:46:55,018 --> 00:46:57,213
And stop callin' me boss, will you?

572
00:47:11,635 --> 00:47:14,661
I'm sorry if I offended you last night.
About your famine story?

573
00:47:14,738 --> 00:47:18,674
Oh, no. A bit of constructive
criticism never goes astray.

574
00:47:20,110 --> 00:47:22,908
What did you think
was melodramatic about it?

575
00:47:22,980 --> 00:47:25,039
- I did offend you.
- No, you didn't.

576
00:47:25,115 --> 00:47:27,106
- Yes, I did.
- It was a good piece.

577
00:47:27,184 --> 00:47:31,245
I know what you were talking about.
I was there for two months in Lombok.

578
00:47:31,321 --> 00:47:33,585
I thought there was
one reference too many to children...

579
00:47:33,657 --> 00:47:35,591
with gaunt rib cages
and dull, listless eyes.

580
00:47:35,659 --> 00:47:37,991
- The rest of it was fine.
- You were there.

581
00:47:38,061 --> 00:47:40,495
Rib cages and eyes
are the real thing, eh?

582
00:47:40,564 --> 00:47:42,623
Perhaps you only needed
to mention it once.

583
00:48:37,287 --> 00:48:39,255
- They always do that.
- What?

584
00:48:40,457 --> 00:48:42,391
They wanna touch
your white skin.

585
00:48:45,829 --> 00:48:47,592
I'm curious about something.

586
00:48:47,664 --> 00:48:48,961
What's that?

587
00:48:49,032 --> 00:48:51,500
Why did you let Ralph
win that swimming race?

588
00:48:51,568 --> 00:48:53,536
You're observant, aren't you?

589
00:48:53,604 --> 00:48:56,164
- Why'd you do it?
- It seemed important to him.

590
00:48:56,240 --> 00:48:59,175
- Are you always that generous?
- Oh, no.

591
00:49:00,310 --> 00:49:02,244
- So why?
- I don't know.

592
00:49:02,312 --> 00:49:05,247
I guess he reminded me of my father.
Same bald head, mustache.

593
00:49:06,517 --> 00:49:09,611
- He was killed in the war.
- How'd you know that?

594
00:49:09,686 --> 00:49:11,950
- Billy told me.
- Billy told you.

595
00:49:15,692 --> 00:49:18,684
Billy? Anyone home?

596
00:49:34,912 --> 00:49:36,971
Was Philippe a good journalist?

597
00:49:38,448 --> 00:49:41,178
- One of the best.
- Where is he now?

598
00:49:41,251 --> 00:49:42,513
Saigon.

599
00:49:43,587 --> 00:49:46,147
- Did Billy tell you?
- Yeah.

600
00:49:46,223 --> 00:49:48,214
You and he have become
quite a team.

601
00:49:49,293 --> 00:49:51,022
He thinks the world of you.

602
00:49:51,094 --> 00:49:53,085
God, I don't know why.

603
00:49:53,163 --> 00:49:57,099
- You're everything he'd like to be.
- He's a strange little guy, you know?

604
00:49:57,167 --> 00:50:00,864
How does he get me an interview
with the top Communist in Indonesia?

605
00:50:02,005 --> 00:50:05,338
- You think he's an agent?
- Well, maybe.

606
00:50:05,409 --> 00:50:07,343
You don't know him very well.

607
00:50:07,411 --> 00:50:10,278
He's a cameraman.
How does he get such good contacts?

608
00:50:10,347 --> 00:50:11,939
I don't know.

609
00:50:12,015 --> 00:50:14,176
People trust him.

610
00:50:14,251 --> 00:50:18,017
He breezes into every embassy reception
whether he's invited or not.

611
00:50:18,088 --> 00:50:20,750
No one can get up the courage
to ask him to leave.

612
00:50:21,892 --> 00:50:25,350
He's keeping a file on me. Why does he
do that if he's not an agent?

613
00:50:25,429 --> 00:50:27,989
- He keeps files on many people.
- What kind of people?

614
00:50:28,065 --> 00:50:29,498
People he cares about.

615
00:50:30,601 --> 00:50:33,035
- Has he told you about lbu?
- Who's that?

616
00:50:33,136 --> 00:50:35,229
A woman he's adopted
from the Kampong.

617
00:50:35,305 --> 00:50:36,795
Billy's got a woman?

618
00:50:36,873 --> 00:50:38,306
More than that.

619
00:50:40,911 --> 00:50:43,175
- That's not his kid, is it?
- No.

620
00:50:43,246 --> 00:50:45,942
He gives them food
and money, that's all.

621
00:50:46,016 --> 00:50:47,449
The old boy.

622
00:50:49,553 --> 00:50:52,181
- Would you like a cup of tea?
- Better not.

623
00:50:52,255 --> 00:50:54,723
I got interviews to do at Priok.

624
00:50:54,791 --> 00:50:56,224
You wanna come?

625
00:50:56,293 --> 00:50:57,624
To Priok?

626
00:50:58,295 --> 00:51:00,354
You can keep an eye
on the melodrama.

627
00:51:24,821 --> 00:51:26,550
What do you do at the embassy?

628
00:51:26,623 --> 00:51:28,420
Apart from socializing.

629
00:51:28,492 --> 00:51:29,720
I work with Ralph.

630
00:51:29,793 --> 00:51:30,885
You a spy?

631
00:51:34,297 --> 00:51:35,787
You're a spook, aren't you?

632
00:51:36,900 --> 00:51:39,266
If I were, I'd hardly
tell you, would I?

633
00:51:43,807 --> 00:51:46,139
What agency did Philippe work for?

634
00:51:49,546 --> 00:51:51,343
When did he go to Saigon?

635
00:51:53,383 --> 00:51:54,816
A long time ago.

636
00:51:55,886 --> 00:51:57,319
Arrogant lot, aren't they?

637
00:51:57,387 --> 00:51:58,513
- Who?
- The French.

638
00:52:00,424 --> 00:52:02,415
I find them absolutely charming.

639
00:52:21,845 --> 00:52:23,836
- Hey!
- Don't you love the tropics?

640
00:52:23,914 --> 00:52:26,144
Torrential. I got it.

641
00:52:26,216 --> 00:52:29,014
- Did you order these?
- I must have.

642
00:52:29,753 --> 00:52:31,744
Let's take 'em with us.

643
00:52:52,609 --> 00:52:54,076
Oh, God!

644
00:52:55,979 --> 00:52:58,004
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

645
00:52:59,082 --> 00:53:00,344
My hat!

646
00:53:02,285 --> 00:53:03,718
What's this?

647
00:53:04,621 --> 00:53:06,179
It's green stuff.

648
00:53:06,256 --> 00:53:08,087
Green stuff usually has ice,
doesn't it?

649
00:53:09,326 --> 00:53:10,588
Get me another.

650
00:53:23,273 --> 00:53:24,706
Don't you have an interview?

651
00:53:33,283 --> 00:53:36,116
- Let's go to the interview.
- Looks better on you.

652
00:53:36,186 --> 00:53:38,552
Does it?
Maybe I should buy one.

653
00:53:38,622 --> 00:53:40,886
- You can have this one cheap.
- Oh, really?

654
00:53:52,869 --> 00:53:55,337
- Well, look, I had a...
- When are you leaving?

655
00:53:55,405 --> 00:53:57,896
- Two weeks.
- What about dinner tonight?

656
00:53:57,974 --> 00:53:59,908
- No, I'm...
- Tomorrow night?

657
00:53:59,976 --> 00:54:01,375
I'm busy all week.

658
00:54:01,444 --> 00:54:02,934
Don't you ever eat?

659
00:54:03,013 --> 00:54:04,275
Good-bye.

660
00:54:06,983 --> 00:54:08,951
I just wanna
see you again, all right?

661
00:54:10,487 --> 00:54:14,321
I'm leaving so soon. What's the point
of complicating things now?

662
00:54:14,391 --> 00:54:16,382
What's complicated about eating?

663
00:54:19,729 --> 00:54:21,856
Good-bye, for the second time.

664
00:54:21,932 --> 00:54:23,365
Good-bye, beautiful.

665
00:54:28,371 --> 00:54:30,305
Watch out for the melodrama.

666
00:54:31,942 --> 00:54:33,933
- I'll call you.
- No, don't.

667
00:54:34,010 --> 00:54:35,773
I will.

668
00:55:05,141 --> 00:55:08,269
The situation, surviving on
a few handfuls of rice...

669
00:55:08,345 --> 00:55:11,803
on this famine-stricken island
of Lombok.

670
00:55:11,882 --> 00:55:14,578
But it's the faces
you can't forget.

671
00:55:14,651 --> 00:55:16,846
Like images
in a recurring nightmare...

672
00:55:16,920 --> 00:55:19,115
they just keep coming back.

673
00:55:19,189 --> 00:55:20,520
Haunted faces...

674
00:55:20,590 --> 00:55:24,424
staring blankly back from the windows
of tumbledown hovels...

675
00:55:24,494 --> 00:55:28,225
the hollow, lifeless eyes,
skin stretched tight across bones...

676
00:55:28,298 --> 00:55:33,065
hands outstretched,
dull, listless eyes imploring.

677
00:55:33,136 --> 00:55:35,536
I move as if in a dream...

678
00:55:35,605 --> 00:55:38,438
through the agony
that is famine.

679
00:55:38,508 --> 00:55:42,945
This is Guy Hamilton in Lombok
for A.B.S. Magazine.

680
00:55:44,514 --> 00:55:47,074
Hello? Hello?

681
00:55:49,719 --> 00:55:52,415
Oh, I'm sorry, Mr. Hamilton.

682
00:55:55,191 --> 00:55:57,682
She's out this evening.
Any message?

683
00:56:00,931 --> 00:56:02,899
I'll tell her you called.
Good night.

684
00:56:05,902 --> 00:56:07,164
Are you sure?

685
00:56:25,956 --> 00:56:27,389
Listen to this, Guy.

686
00:57:25,615 --> 00:57:29,642
Guy, I'm not gonna be here
for a few days.

687
00:57:29,719 --> 00:57:32,381
Use the bungalow.
Have some peace and quiet.

688
00:57:32,455 --> 00:57:33,717
Sure.

689
00:57:43,533 --> 00:57:45,467
What are you grinning at,
you fox?

690
00:57:47,037 --> 00:57:48,334
These are good.

691
00:57:55,478 --> 00:57:58,140
Jilly, you've only got
ten days to go.

692
00:58:00,850 --> 00:58:02,340
Ten days.

693
00:58:04,821 --> 00:58:06,254
Any regrets?

694
00:58:14,497 --> 00:58:15,555
None.

695
00:58:15,632 --> 00:58:16,866
Her Britannic Majesty's Ambassador,
Sir Andrew Watt and Lady Watt...

696
00:58:16,866 --> 00:58:19,494
Her Britannic Majesty's Ambassador,
Sir Andrew Watt and Lady Watt...

697
00:58:19,569 --> 00:58:23,232
request the pleasure of the company
of G.S. Hamilton, Esquire.

698
00:58:27,744 --> 00:58:29,336
You going to this?

699
00:58:29,412 --> 00:58:30,743
You joking?

700
00:58:30,814 --> 00:58:32,247
You might learn something.

701
00:58:32,315 --> 00:58:34,647
I doubt it.
The British don't let much slip.

702
00:58:34,717 --> 00:58:37,709
Yes, they do. They're just more subtle.
You gotta listen harder.

703
00:58:37,787 --> 00:58:39,049
Come again?

704
00:58:41,124 --> 00:58:43,058
Jill will be there.

705
00:59:09,152 --> 00:59:12,553
Ladies and gentlemen,
music from Henderson...

706
00:59:12,622 --> 00:59:13,987
oysters from Qantas.

707
00:59:39,048 --> 00:59:40,481
Ladies and gentlemen.

708
00:59:42,152 --> 00:59:44,313
Ladies and gentlemen,
could I remind those of you...

709
00:59:44,387 --> 00:59:47,652
driving back to Jakarta this evening,
the curfew hour approaches.

710
00:59:59,469 --> 01:00:00,868
- Good night, sir.
- Good night.

711
01:00:00,937 --> 01:00:02,268
Good night.

712
01:00:02,338 --> 01:00:04,568
Excuse me, sir.
It's terribly late.

713
01:00:04,641 --> 01:00:06,666
The ambassador's already
asked me to close up.

714
01:00:06,743 --> 01:00:08,802
- Good night.
- Good night.

715
01:00:44,347 --> 01:00:46,838
Good evening. Are you
enjoying yourself? I must apologize.

716
01:00:46,916 --> 01:00:49,749
I must speak to Miss Bryant.
It's about that interview.

717
01:00:52,555 --> 01:00:54,785
You don't answer my phone calls.

718
01:01:05,802 --> 01:01:08,270
- Let's go.
- I can't.

719
01:01:08,338 --> 01:01:09,862
So what?

720
01:01:09,939 --> 01:01:12,305
I can't leave with you.
Everyone in Jakarta...

721
01:01:17,080 --> 01:01:19,071
I'm leaving in less than a week.

722
01:01:31,427 --> 01:01:32,587
Good-bye.

723
01:01:44,173 --> 01:01:45,765
Start, you bastard.

724
01:01:47,310 --> 01:01:48,868
Shit!

725
01:01:54,417 --> 01:01:56,078
Not the Hotel Indonesia.

726
01:01:56,152 --> 01:01:57,414
All right?

727
01:02:06,596 --> 01:02:08,587
Jill! What the hell
are you doing?

728
01:02:09,399 --> 01:02:10,798
The curfew!

729
01:02:42,932 --> 01:02:45,127
Damn it! A roadblock.

730
01:02:56,412 --> 01:02:58,346
Okay, get down.

731
01:04:27,870 --> 01:04:29,303
Good morning.

732
01:04:33,242 --> 01:04:35,403
- Good morning.
- Good morning, Jill.

733
01:04:46,756 --> 01:04:48,189
Ralph, I'm so sorry...

734
01:04:48,257 --> 01:04:49,690
So am I.

735
01:04:55,298 --> 01:04:57,357
I hope you know
what you're doing.

736
01:05:08,811 --> 01:05:10,210
Morning.

737
01:05:14,784 --> 01:05:16,411
Sorry I'm late.

738
01:05:20,890 --> 01:05:23,882
Bryant, Jillian Edith.

739
01:05:23,960 --> 01:05:29,694
Nationality: British.
Born: 1938, under the sign of Pisces.

740
01:05:29,765 --> 01:05:31,164
I must be mad.

741
01:05:31,234 --> 01:05:34,863
Occupation:
Assistant to military attaché...

742
01:05:34,937 --> 01:05:37,770
British Embassy, Jakarta.

743
01:05:37,840 --> 01:05:40,866
Former postings:
Brussels, Singapore.

744
01:05:42,178 --> 01:05:44,305
Little religious feeling...

745
01:05:44,380 --> 01:05:46,314
yet has a reverence for life.

746
01:05:47,216 --> 01:05:50,413
This is a spirit
like a wavering flame...

747
01:05:50,486 --> 01:05:53,649
which only needs care
to burn high.

748
01:05:53,723 --> 01:05:57,750
If this does not happen, she could
lapse into the promiscuity...

749
01:05:57,827 --> 01:06:00,261
and bitterness
of the failed romantic.

750
01:06:13,876 --> 01:06:15,138
What's funny?

751
01:06:16,212 --> 01:06:17,611
You're looking pooped, kid.

752
01:06:18,814 --> 01:06:21,146
Good luck to you.
They're only jealous.

753
01:06:23,286 --> 01:06:26,016
I hear she really
turns it on, huh?

754
01:06:26,923 --> 01:06:28,288
That what you heard?

755
01:06:36,165 --> 01:06:38,156
You saw it.
The guy's a lunatic.

756
01:06:39,602 --> 01:06:41,536
I think our boy's in love.

757
01:06:45,775 --> 01:06:48,039
Okay, start her up.

758
01:06:54,517 --> 01:06:56,485
Switch her off.

759
01:06:57,219 --> 01:06:58,379
Yes, sir.

760
01:07:02,091 --> 01:07:03,353
Why London?

761
01:07:03,426 --> 01:07:06,657
- Why are you transferrin' there?
- Why do you want to go to Saigon?

762
01:07:06,729 --> 01:07:09,027
It's the center of things.

763
01:07:09,098 --> 01:07:11,896
I'll be able to find out what's really
going on in the world...

764
01:07:11,968 --> 01:07:14,903
not have to read about it
in the yellow press like most people.

765
01:07:26,315 --> 01:07:27,748
Why don't you stay?

766
01:07:30,953 --> 01:07:32,386
Why should I?

767
01:07:33,889 --> 01:07:35,823
Hmm, Mr. Hamilton?

768
01:09:04,513 --> 01:09:05,946
What is it?

769
01:09:12,154 --> 01:09:13,587
You're soaking.

770
01:09:21,430 --> 01:09:23,364
What is it? What's wrong?

771
01:10:37,973 --> 01:10:41,431
We got a coded message through
from Singapore this morning.

772
01:10:41,510 --> 01:10:45,139
A ship left Shanghai a few days ago
with arms for the P.K.I.

773
01:10:50,052 --> 01:10:51,314
Civil war.

774
01:10:51,887 --> 01:10:52,911
Yes.

775
01:10:54,690 --> 01:10:57,557
I'm not giving you some scoop.
I want you to save your life.

776
01:10:57,626 --> 01:10:59,753
- I know, but you can't expect...
- lf the P.K.I. Take over...

777
01:10:59,829 --> 01:11:01,729
they'll slaughter
every European in Jakarta.

778
01:11:03,465 --> 01:11:05,160
I can get you out on a plane.

779
01:11:05,234 --> 01:11:07,429
- I'll talk to Ralph.
- No, Jill, I'm staying.

780
01:11:12,508 --> 01:11:14,908
Nothing will keep the Communists
and the Muslims apart now.

781
01:11:14,977 --> 01:11:16,410
Not even Sukarno.

782
01:11:24,353 --> 01:11:26,287
I wonder how they're
gonna get the stuff in.

783
01:11:28,691 --> 01:11:31,524
Probably a port up north.
Yeah, they'll come in up north.

784
01:11:32,628 --> 01:11:35,324
Under a false bill of lading.
Tennis rackets, toilet seats.

785
01:11:35,397 --> 01:11:36,694
You can't use this.

786
01:11:38,367 --> 01:11:40,335
Then you shouldn't have told me.

787
01:11:53,549 --> 01:11:55,779
Hello, Billy.
What are you doing here?

788
01:11:55,851 --> 01:11:57,944
Waiting for you.

789
01:11:58,020 --> 01:12:01,148
Should be more work for you soon.
I'm trackin' something down.

790
01:12:01,223 --> 01:12:03,885
- About an arms shipment?
- Jill told you.

791
01:12:05,394 --> 01:12:06,918
Getting nowhere on it.

792
01:12:06,996 --> 01:12:08,395
You shouldn't even be looking.

793
01:12:09,565 --> 01:12:10,725
Why not?

794
01:12:10,799 --> 01:12:13,267
She told you in confidence,
the same as she told me.

795
01:12:13,335 --> 01:12:16,065
If you break the story,
everyone will know it came from her.

796
01:12:16,138 --> 01:12:19,904
- I'll only run it with my own evidence.
- That should ease your conscience.

797
01:12:19,975 --> 01:12:22,341
Everyone will still know
where it came from.

798
01:12:22,411 --> 01:12:25,141
I can't let a story
like that just lie.

799
01:12:25,214 --> 01:12:28,547
I'm not running any story until
I get independent confirmation.

800
01:12:28,617 --> 01:12:30,380
That's the best I can do.

801
01:12:30,452 --> 01:12:35,219
If the Communists have the slightest
idea what you're after, you're dead.

802
01:12:35,291 --> 01:12:38,522
When that arms shipment comes in,
this whole country blows up.

803
01:12:40,362 --> 01:12:41,294
I'm talking to you.

804
01:12:42,698 --> 01:12:44,632
If I don't follow
something like this...

805
01:12:44,700 --> 01:12:47,362
I might as well go
and grow watermelons!

806
01:12:47,436 --> 01:12:49,097
You have changed.

807
01:12:50,406 --> 01:12:52,465
You are capable of betrayal.

808
01:12:54,677 --> 01:12:57,305
Is it possible
I was wrong about you?

809
01:12:58,380 --> 01:13:02,714
You abuse your position as journalist
and grow addicted to risk.

810
01:13:02,785 --> 01:13:06,221
You attempt to rule neat lines
around yourself...

811
01:13:06,288 --> 01:13:08,051
making a fetish of your career...

812
01:13:08,123 --> 01:13:10,523
and making all relationships
temporary...

813
01:13:10,592 --> 01:13:12,617
lest they disturb that career.

814
01:13:13,896 --> 01:13:16,729
Why can't you give yourself?

815
01:13:16,799 --> 01:13:18,824
Why can't you learn to love?

816
01:13:18,901 --> 01:13:22,337
A shipment that size does not come into
the country without somebody noticing.

817
01:13:22,404 --> 01:13:24,099
Perhaps there is no such shipment.

818
01:13:24,173 --> 01:13:26,607
No such shipment.

819
01:13:31,580 --> 01:13:34,572
- Come back in two days.
- Keep an eye peeled.

820
01:13:38,153 --> 01:13:40,314
Be careful who you talk to
about this matter.

821
01:13:40,389 --> 01:13:43,756
I'm not P.K.I.,
but I might have been.

822
01:13:58,307 --> 01:14:00,901
- No luck, boss?
- Not a bloody thing.

823
01:15:00,636 --> 01:15:03,503
- Why are we stopped here?
- It's getting late.

824
01:15:03,572 --> 01:15:06,507
- We'll have a rest and a swim.
- No, we got too much work to do.

825
01:15:06,575 --> 01:15:07,735
Tomorrow.

826
01:15:11,780 --> 01:15:13,247
What is this place?

827
01:15:13,315 --> 01:15:16,716
An old Dutch villa. Tiger Lily
is a friend. We stay here sometimes.

828
01:15:34,603 --> 01:15:35,592
Cheers.

829
01:16:05,300 --> 01:16:06,824
I'll see you after siesta.

830
01:16:08,504 --> 01:16:10,472
You are in old Java now, boss.

831
01:18:34,149 --> 01:18:35,741
You're P.K.I., aren't you?

832
01:18:49,097 --> 01:18:52,555
My country suffers under a great weight
of poverty and corruption.

833
01:18:54,136 --> 01:18:56,104
Is it wrong to want to change that?

834
01:19:00,008 --> 01:19:01,942
When the killing starts,
are you gonna be part of it?

835
01:19:02,010 --> 01:19:04,911
- Sometimes there's no other way.
- Yeah, sure, Kumar.

836
01:19:08,417 --> 01:19:10,248
You must not ask anymore
about the shipment.

837
01:19:11,853 --> 01:19:13,946
- You know when it's arriving?
- Maybe it's already here.

838
01:19:14,856 --> 01:19:17,484
- That's the confirmation I need.
- Listen to me!

839
01:19:17,559 --> 01:19:21,859
I am unimportant in the Party.
Even Tiger Lily's more highly placed.

840
01:19:22,998 --> 01:19:24,192
They have a death list.

841
01:19:25,300 --> 01:19:26,767
You are on it.

842
01:19:29,538 --> 01:19:30,971
Come on.

843
01:19:34,276 --> 01:19:35,743
For craps sake.

844
01:19:36,878 --> 01:19:38,243
Hello. Are you there?

845
01:19:38,313 --> 01:19:40,247
- Hello?
- I'm sorry.

846
01:19:40,315 --> 01:19:44,149
Miss Bryant is still unavailable.
May I take a message?

847
01:19:44,219 --> 01:19:45,618
Shit!

848
01:20:03,405 --> 01:20:05,339
I got something to show you!

849
01:20:07,542 --> 01:20:12,479
Well, be-bop-a-lula
She's my baby

850
01:20:12,547 --> 01:20:14,947
Be-bob-a-lula
I don't mean maybe

851
01:20:15,016 --> 01:20:17,814
I got that bitch, baby.
Saigon. Huh?

852
01:20:17,886 --> 01:20:20,081
Be-bop-a-lula
She's my baby

853
01:20:20,155 --> 01:20:21,918
I'll be blastin' gooks
and kickin' ass.

854
01:20:22,657 --> 01:20:24,386
Want another shot?

855
01:20:24,459 --> 01:20:25,721
Yeah.

856
01:20:29,765 --> 01:20:32,996
The thing is this. I don't want
any ill feelings about this.

857
01:20:33,068 --> 01:20:36,003
I know it's hard to squash
those pangs of envy...

858
01:20:36,071 --> 01:20:38,733
when you're sitting in the presence
of talent like mine.

859
01:20:38,807 --> 01:20:40,399
Think of it this way.

860
01:20:40,475 --> 01:20:43,444
If there weren't guys like me in
this business, what would you aspire to?

861
01:20:43,512 --> 01:20:45,412
I'm glad you're going
to Saigon, shithead.

862
01:20:45,480 --> 01:20:47,471
I know.
You told me that four times.

863
01:20:47,549 --> 01:20:50,484
You are gonna miss out on
the biggest story of your life.

864
01:20:50,552 --> 01:20:52,747
- Like what?
- Just wait and see.

865
01:20:52,821 --> 01:20:56,450
You terrify me.
I mean, there I am.

866
01:20:56,525 --> 01:21:00,222
I'm waiting to announce that
China's entering the war. Right?

867
01:21:00,295 --> 01:21:01,853
Along comes young Hamilton.

868
01:21:01,930 --> 01:21:05,024
Blows me out of the water
with an update on Sukarno's pile.

869
01:21:10,205 --> 01:21:13,197
You are pretty good.
You had me runnin' there.

870
01:21:19,848 --> 01:21:21,281
Check this out.

871
01:21:31,126 --> 01:21:32,718
Hey, yeah.
Misters, right.

872
01:21:32,794 --> 01:21:35,786
Hey, yeah.
Okay, you bevy of beauties.

873
01:21:35,864 --> 01:21:38,332
Come on, baby.

874
01:21:47,843 --> 01:21:50,539
Let me show you how it's done.

875
01:21:59,087 --> 01:22:00,645
No dance!

876
01:22:02,591 --> 01:22:04,491
You! Stop dance!

877
01:22:06,561 --> 01:22:08,085
- Take it easy.
- Out!

878
01:22:08,163 --> 01:22:10,358
We're on the way.
We're just leavin'.

879
01:22:10,432 --> 01:22:12,366
Good night, everybody.
We had a lot of laughs.

880
01:22:13,268 --> 01:22:14,326
Adiós.

881
01:22:18,173 --> 01:22:21,631
- Is this reefer?
- No, it's a Mars bar.

882
01:22:23,745 --> 01:22:25,679
Get the windows up!
Lock the door!

883
01:22:28,383 --> 01:22:29,816
See anybody you like?

884
01:22:36,291 --> 01:22:38,282
Let's get a little light
on the subject.

885
01:22:38,360 --> 01:22:40,157
Do you like her?

886
01:22:41,463 --> 01:22:42,691
She likes you!

887
01:22:42,764 --> 01:22:44,789
This is what you call "yellow fever."

888
01:22:44,866 --> 01:22:46,800
Me do it.

889
01:22:46,868 --> 01:22:48,358
- Mister?
- Me cheap.

890
01:22:49,604 --> 01:22:51,469
I think I'm in love.

891
01:22:51,540 --> 01:22:53,804
I'm good, mister.

892
01:22:53,875 --> 01:22:57,470
- Me cheap.
- Oh, yeah, baby!

893
01:22:58,380 --> 01:22:59,574
Yes. Hey!

894
01:22:59,648 --> 01:23:02,344
What are you doing?
What's the matter with you?

895
01:23:02,417 --> 01:23:03,907
- It's a meat market.
- Come on.

896
01:23:03,985 --> 01:23:06,215
- I'm goin'. Are you staying?
- I'm stayin'.

897
01:23:06,288 --> 01:23:07,846
- Okay. Get out.
- Take it easy.

898
01:23:07,923 --> 01:23:10,187
- Have a nice time.
- Yeah.

899
01:23:10,258 --> 01:23:12,385
Girls. Huh?

900
01:23:13,762 --> 01:23:15,821
It's your old pal, Pistol Pete.

901
01:23:26,441 --> 01:23:28,432
Yeah, yeah, okay.

902
01:23:32,614 --> 01:23:34,582
Sorry, Miss Bryant's
not available.

903
01:23:39,087 --> 01:23:40,349
Thanks.

904
01:26:58,052 --> 01:27:01,453
Billy, come over here.
Been looking everywhere for you.

905
01:27:01,523 --> 01:27:02,649
What is all this?

906
01:27:02,724 --> 01:27:04,385
Bulgarian Independence Day.

907
01:27:04,459 --> 01:27:07,257
Not a crucial day in modern history,
but Sukarno's coming...

908
01:27:07,328 --> 01:27:08,761
in a couple of hours.

909
01:27:08,830 --> 01:27:10,821
We think he'll use
the occasion for a speech.

910
01:27:10,899 --> 01:27:14,528
- I'm sure he will.
- Later. Right now we're celebrating.

911
01:27:14,602 --> 01:27:17,469
- What are you celebrating?
- Curtis got Saigon.

912
01:27:18,873 --> 01:27:21,637
Curtis got Saigon.

913
01:27:21,709 --> 01:27:24,473
Well, we must all drink to that.

914
01:27:24,546 --> 01:27:26,514
Don't give me this crap tonight.

915
01:27:26,581 --> 01:27:30,142
Wherever human misery is at its worst,
the press will be there in force.

916
01:27:30,218 --> 01:27:32,914
- To Saigon!
- Give me a break.

917
01:27:32,987 --> 01:27:35,581
People are out there fighting
in the streets for rice.

918
01:27:35,657 --> 01:27:38,023
I shot some footage.
Does anybody want it?

919
01:27:38,092 --> 01:27:39,650
It's a temporary shortage.

920
01:27:39,727 --> 01:27:42,662
Why don't you tell them
the true story, gentlemen?

921
01:27:42,730 --> 01:27:45,597
Why don't you tell them that Sukarno
makes empty speeches...

922
01:27:45,667 --> 01:27:48,363
and builds monuments to his vanity
while his people starve to death.

923
01:27:48,436 --> 01:27:50,631
Tell them that he says,
"Eat rats!"

924
01:27:50,705 --> 01:27:54,038
You were the one who told us
he was a great man.

925
01:27:54,108 --> 01:27:57,100
He was. That's why
his betrayal is so hideous.

926
01:27:57,178 --> 01:27:58,110
Steady on, Billy.

927
01:27:58,179 --> 01:28:00,044
I've never agreed with you...

928
01:28:00,114 --> 01:28:02,548
on just how much the people
mean to Sukarno.

929
01:28:02,617 --> 01:28:05,780
The only thing he wanted to do for
his people was to go to bed with them.

930
01:28:05,854 --> 01:28:07,549
The female ones, that is.

931
01:28:08,790 --> 01:28:13,454
You're right. He does use his people
as objects of pleasure, but so do you.

932
01:28:13,528 --> 01:28:15,655
Only you do it with boys!

933
01:28:16,865 --> 01:28:18,890
What did you say?
You little bastard!

934
01:28:21,369 --> 01:28:24,702
- They'll throw him out of the country!
- You're no better, you and your girls!

935
01:28:24,772 --> 01:28:26,205
Put him down!

936
01:28:39,087 --> 01:28:41,021
I'll have my bags packed tonight.

937
01:28:50,698 --> 01:28:52,757
I want to talk to you!

938
01:29:02,210 --> 01:29:03,905
Billy, stop!

939
01:29:03,978 --> 01:29:06,913
- What's the matter with you?
- What do you want?

940
01:29:12,720 --> 01:29:16,121
- You made the broadcast.
- I didn't source that back to Jill.

941
01:29:16,190 --> 01:29:19,182
- Doesn't matter. That's not the point.
- Yes, it is the point.

942
01:29:19,260 --> 01:29:22,320
When this thing breaks, it could change
the political shape of Southeast Asia.

943
01:29:22,397 --> 01:29:24,365
How far are my loyalties
to Jill supposed to go?

944
01:29:24,432 --> 01:29:27,526
I would have given up the world for her.
You won't give up one story.

945
01:29:27,602 --> 01:29:30,799
It's not just a story.
It's the bloody story.

946
01:29:30,872 --> 01:29:32,635
Can't you understand that?

947
01:29:32,707 --> 01:29:35,403
Don't you understand?
You've lost Jill.

948
01:29:35,476 --> 01:29:37,137
What have you told her?

949
01:29:37,211 --> 01:29:41,011
I gave her to you. I'm taking
her back. Do you understand?

950
01:29:41,082 --> 01:29:43,209
You gave her to me?

951
01:29:43,284 --> 01:29:44,808
For Christ's sake.

952
01:29:44,886 --> 01:29:46,649
You mad little bastard!

953
01:29:46,721 --> 01:29:50,657
You think you can control people's lives
just 'cause you got 'em in your files?

954
01:29:53,528 --> 01:29:57,521
I believed in you.
I thought you were a man of light.

955
01:29:57,598 --> 01:30:00,590
That's why I gave you those stories
you think are so important.

956
01:30:00,668 --> 01:30:02,898
I made you see things.

957
01:30:02,971 --> 01:30:05,235
I made you feel something
about what you write.

958
01:30:05,306 --> 01:30:08,275
I gave you my trust.
So did Jill.

959
01:30:10,511 --> 01:30:12,274
I created you.

960
01:31:07,068 --> 01:31:08,501
Oh, my God.

961
01:31:10,038 --> 01:31:11,869
My God.

962
01:31:11,939 --> 01:31:13,600
My God.

963
01:31:59,320 --> 01:32:01,254
What then must we do?

964
01:32:08,896 --> 01:32:11,057
What then must we do?

965
01:32:15,336 --> 01:32:16,928
What then...

966
01:32:18,272 --> 01:32:21,105
must we do?

967
01:32:26,380 --> 01:32:28,177
We must...

968
01:32:49,637 --> 01:32:50,763
Very nice.

969
01:32:50,838 --> 01:32:52,829
719, please.

970
01:32:54,408 --> 01:32:56,000
Room 719?

971
01:33:02,416 --> 01:33:03,781
Excuse me.

972
01:34:06,714 --> 01:34:08,682
- I made the broadcast.
- Yes, I know.

973
01:34:08,749 --> 01:34:10,683
I got it confirmed
straight from the P.K.I.

974
01:34:10,751 --> 01:34:12,514
I decided to tell you.

975
01:34:12,587 --> 01:34:14,578
You're a journalist.

976
01:34:30,171 --> 01:34:32,196
- Who is it?
- Mr. Davis, security check.

977
01:34:32,273 --> 01:34:33,706
What's going on?

978
01:34:35,276 --> 01:34:37,210
You see the notice
on the door here?

979
01:35:59,327 --> 01:36:00,988
Hey, Guy! Come on!

980
01:36:54,081 --> 01:36:55,742
I didn't mean to frighten you.

981
01:36:56,851 --> 01:36:58,819
You shouldn't be here.
Security men are all over.

982
01:36:58,886 --> 01:37:01,218
I know. I don't
want them to get his files.

983
01:37:14,902 --> 01:37:17,166
He was murdered, wasn't he?

984
01:37:17,238 --> 01:37:18,830
Yeah.

985
01:37:18,906 --> 01:37:21,431
Over a banner, and Sukarno
didn't even see it.

986
01:37:38,893 --> 01:37:41,361
- Who took this?
- He did.

987
01:37:42,430 --> 01:37:46,423
Self-timer, outside that grotty little
restaurant he always used to drag me to.

988
01:37:47,301 --> 01:37:49,428
"Best food in Jakarta, old man."

989
01:37:51,439 --> 01:37:53,373
God, I loved him.

990
01:38:00,347 --> 01:38:01,439
When you leaving?

991
01:38:06,454 --> 01:38:08,217
Tomorrow.

992
01:38:08,289 --> 01:38:09,551
What time?

993
01:38:10,458 --> 01:38:12,119
2:00.

994
01:38:13,461 --> 01:38:16,123
I never wanted to hurt you
by running that story.

995
01:38:18,732 --> 01:38:20,666
I wanted to talk to you about it.

996
01:38:20,734 --> 01:38:22,599
I don't want to lose you.

997
01:38:33,481 --> 01:38:35,415
You go first. Back door.

998
01:38:35,483 --> 01:38:38,350
- What about you?
- I'll be right behind you. Go!

999
01:38:43,824 --> 01:38:46,190
Jill. I'll be on that plane.

1000
01:39:11,752 --> 01:39:14,016
What's going on?
I gotta get to the airport.

1001
01:39:21,428 --> 01:39:23,293
What is it?

1002
01:39:23,364 --> 01:39:24,831
What's going on?

1003
01:39:24,899 --> 01:39:26,924
Some people have
taken over government.

1004
01:39:27,001 --> 01:39:28,263
Troops have moved...

1005
01:39:28,335 --> 01:39:30,269
to the president's palace.

1006
01:39:37,144 --> 01:39:38,202
Let's go.

1007
01:39:40,781 --> 01:39:43,306
Broadcast say
we should not go out.

1008
01:39:43,384 --> 01:39:47,377
It's okay. They won't touch us.
Come on. Come on!

1009
01:40:04,505 --> 01:40:06,598
I think you better keep
the engine running, eh?

1010
01:40:14,882 --> 01:40:16,907
Press. Foreign press.

1011
01:40:16,984 --> 01:40:18,645
A.B.S. Press.

1012
01:40:21,522 --> 01:40:24,821
I don't understand you.
I want to go to the palace.

1013
01:41:12,673 --> 01:41:14,436
Take me to the airport.

1014
01:41:14,508 --> 01:41:16,533
Can't, boss. Roadblock.

1015
01:41:17,845 --> 01:41:20,609
- Take me to Billy Kwan's.
- Okay, boss.

1016
01:41:37,731 --> 01:41:41,758
The retina is detached.
You must lie very still.

1017
01:41:41,835 --> 01:41:44,599
- How long?
- A week, maybe. Ten days.

1018
01:41:44,672 --> 01:41:47,766
If you wish to save your eye,
you will lie still.

1019
01:41:49,109 --> 01:41:51,168
You have to bandage both eyes?

1020
01:41:51,245 --> 01:41:53,270
- I'll be helpless.
- I'm sorry.

1021
01:42:11,331 --> 01:42:13,424
Your eye will be better?

1022
01:42:14,568 --> 01:42:15,830
Maybe not.

1023
01:42:18,238 --> 01:42:20,900
Lucky still got one.

1024
01:42:25,779 --> 01:42:27,747
But men might come soon, I think.

1025
01:42:29,783 --> 01:42:31,717
I must go home to family.

1026
01:42:33,454 --> 01:42:35,149
I'm sorry, boss.

1027
01:42:36,824 --> 01:42:38,382
Good-bye, Hortono.

1028
01:42:38,459 --> 01:42:39,892
Good-bye, boss.

1029
01:43:26,940 --> 01:43:29,204
Krishna says to him...

1030
01:43:29,276 --> 01:43:33,007
"All is clouded by desire, Arjuna...

1031
01:43:33,080 --> 01:43:37,915
"as a fire by smoke,
as a mirror by dust.

1032
01:43:37,985 --> 01:43:40,749
"Through these,
it blinds the soul."

1033
01:43:45,425 --> 01:43:46,858
Who is that?

1034
01:43:47,761 --> 01:43:49,752
Hortono? Who's that?

1035
01:43:49,830 --> 01:43:51,263
It's me, boss.

1036
01:43:52,966 --> 01:43:54,900
Have you been sent to kill me?

1037
01:43:56,003 --> 01:43:57,436
We have failed.

1038
01:44:01,275 --> 01:44:03,971
We have been overcome
by the Muslim generals.

1039
01:44:04,044 --> 01:44:06,239
What about Sukarno?

1040
01:44:06,313 --> 01:44:08,873
He is finished. He will
become a puppet of the Right.

1041
01:44:08,949 --> 01:44:10,416
And you?

1042
01:44:10,484 --> 01:44:11,917
I'm a dead man.

1043
01:44:15,489 --> 01:44:17,423
I'm sorry about your eye.

1044
01:44:20,494 --> 01:44:23,520
There should be a packet of cigarettes
on the table. Help yourself.

1045
01:44:29,036 --> 01:44:31,334
Still the good cigarettes, boss.

1046
01:44:41,648 --> 01:44:42,910
Thank you.

1047
01:44:48,021 --> 01:44:49,113
Tell me something.

1048
01:44:50,023 --> 01:44:51,149
Sure.

1049
01:44:51,225 --> 01:44:52,658
Am I a stupid man?

1050
01:44:56,196 --> 01:44:58,562
Then why should I live
like a poor man all my life...

1051
01:44:58,632 --> 01:45:00,623
when stupid people
in your country live well?

1052
01:45:01,535 --> 01:45:03,059
Good question.

1053
01:45:03,136 --> 01:45:05,161
- Then please answer it.
- I can't.

1054
01:45:05,239 --> 01:45:07,434
Then why do you condemn
those in my country...

1055
01:45:07,507 --> 01:45:09,441
who try to do something about it?

1056
01:45:15,716 --> 01:45:17,775
Mister Billy Kwan was right.

1057
01:45:17,851 --> 01:45:19,785
Westerners do not have
answers anymore.

1058
01:45:26,126 --> 01:45:27,525
Water from the moon.

1059
01:45:28,762 --> 01:45:30,127
What does that mean?

1060
01:45:30,197 --> 01:45:31,960
It's an old Javanese saying.

1061
01:45:33,033 --> 01:45:35,024
Means something
one cannot ever have.

1062
01:45:38,105 --> 01:45:39,367
What time is it?

1063
01:45:40,274 --> 01:45:41,332
Just past 1:00.

1064
01:45:42,876 --> 01:45:45,037
- The airport closed?
- Not yet...

1065
01:45:45,112 --> 01:45:48,172
but everything will close down
when the army proclaims martial law.

1066
01:45:50,717 --> 01:45:51,979
Drive me there.

1067
01:45:53,420 --> 01:45:55,786
They have roadblocked the city.

1068
01:45:55,856 --> 01:45:57,323
Never stopped us before.

1069
01:46:00,794 --> 01:46:02,227
They will arrest me.

1070
01:46:02,296 --> 01:46:05,288
You can wait here to die,
or you can drive me to the airport...

1071
01:46:05,365 --> 01:46:07,390
and then take the car
up into the hills.

1072
01:46:07,467 --> 01:46:10,095
Why do you have to leave now?

1073
01:46:10,170 --> 01:46:12,604
You can stay and write
all the stories you want.

1074
01:46:28,388 --> 01:46:30,515
I hope to catch a plane
is worth losing your eye.

1075
01:46:35,963 --> 01:46:38,397
Go around, Kumar. Go up.

1076
01:47:05,659 --> 01:47:10,255
Easy. Don't show them
anything, Kumar.

1077
01:47:10,330 --> 01:47:12,594
You go up to the...

1078
01:47:17,371 --> 01:47:19,305
Calmly. Calm.

1079
01:47:20,540 --> 01:47:22,804
Easy.

1080
01:47:33,653 --> 01:47:35,143
- What's he want?
- Papers.

1081
01:47:36,556 --> 01:47:38,353
Corporal, here's my papers.

1082
01:47:38,425 --> 01:47:41,690
Australian Broadcasting Service.
I'm a journalist. He's my assistant.

1083
01:47:41,762 --> 01:47:43,627
We must go to the airport.

1084
01:48:09,589 --> 01:48:11,250
Thank you very much.

1085
01:48:43,323 --> 01:48:45,086
- I'm sorry...
- Don't worry.

1086
01:48:45,826 --> 01:48:47,817
We will win because
we believe in something.

1087
01:48:49,930 --> 01:48:51,488
- Good-bye.
- Think of me, Guy...

1088
01:48:51,565 --> 01:48:53,863
when you're sitting
in some nice cafe in Europe.

1089
01:48:53,934 --> 01:48:57,028
In my dreams, I'm always
sitting at the table...

1090
01:48:57,104 --> 01:48:58,867
by the footpath,
drinking coffee.

1091
01:49:01,007 --> 01:49:02,941
- Good luck.
- Now go.

1092
01:49:03,009 --> 01:49:04,909
Quickly!

1093
01:49:13,920 --> 01:49:16,013
- No!
- I got a ticket, asshole!

1094
01:49:21,595 --> 01:49:23,654
No bags. See? Okay?

1095
01:49:24,998 --> 01:49:28,434
Hey! Royal Netherlands.
You got it? Right.

1096
01:49:30,537 --> 01:49:32,528
Royal Netherlands, 2:00,
all right?

1097
01:50:03,837 --> 01:50:04,963
Thank you.

1098
01:50:08,108 --> 01:50:10,076
Hey, stop! You!

1099
01:50:13,213 --> 01:50:15,272
- What?
- You bring that here!

1100
01:50:29,596 --> 01:50:30,858
This is Guy Hamilton...

1101
01:50:30,931 --> 01:50:33,092
reporting from Jakarta,
where a coup attempt...

1102
01:50:33,166 --> 01:50:35,100
by the Communist P.K. I...
