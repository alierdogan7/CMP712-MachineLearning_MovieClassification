00:12:29,331 --> 00:12:30,832
YOU TRIED TO CONTROL HER, ERIC.

220
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:33,501
AND THE WOMAN ALWAYS
CONTROLS THE MAN.

221
00:12:34,336 --> 00:12:35,795
THAT'S TRUE.

222
00:12:35,838 --> 00:12:37,255
DONNA DOES NOT CONTROL ME!

223
00:12:37,298 --> 00:12:41,301

TO LEARN, MY FRIEND.

224
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:44,304

WAS STILL CONTROLLING ME.

00:13:06,035 --> 00:13:09,287
YOU KNOW, THAT'S KINDA FUNNY.
THAT WAS YOUR GUITAR.

230
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:14,834
BURN!

231
00:13:16,754 --> 00:13:19,672
HYDE, THOSE BOOTS
LOOK REALLY NICE ON YOU.

232
00:13:20,674 --> 00:13:23,301
YOU KNOW, JACKIE, YOU BUYING
ME BOOTS IS JUST WRONG.

233
00:13:23,344 --> 00:13:25,970
YOU SHOULD'VE LET ME
SHOPLIFT THEM.

234
00:13:26,013 --> 00:13:28,014
NO, HYDE. I WANT YOU
TO HAVE THEM.

235
00:13:28,057 --> 00:13:29,724
BESIDES, I'M SAVING A FORTUNE

236
00:13:29,767 --> 00:13:33,603
NOW THAT I DON'T HAVE TO FEED
AND CLOTHE MICHAEL.

237
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:35,230
WELL, IF YOU INSIST.

238
00:13:35,272 --> 00:13:36,648
I DO.

239
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:38,358
SO I WAS THINKING
TOMORROW NIGHT,

240
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:40,109
WE SHOULD, YOU KNOW...

241
00:13:40,152 --> 00:13:43,029
WHOA, OKAY. ALL RIGHT NOW,
COME ON, JACKIE.

242
00:13:43,072 --> 00:13:45,698
THIS WAS A ONE TIME ONLY
THING, ALL RIGHT?

243
00:13:45,741 --> 00:13:47,408
IF YOU'RE TRYING TO BRIBE
ME WITH THESE BOOTS, MAN,

244
00:13:47,451 --> 00:13:49,327
YOU CAN JUST TAKE THEM BACK.

245
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:51,120
I SEE.

246
00:13:51,163 --> 00:13:54,415
OH, WHAT ARE YOU
GONNA DO NOW, CRY?

247
00:13:56,377 --> 00:13:59,295
OH, MAN, YOU'RE CRYING.

248
00:13:59,338 --> 00:14:01,464
HEY, JACKIE...

249
00:14:01,507 --> 00:14:03,091
COME ON, MAN.

250
00:14:03,133 --> 00:14:05,510
IT'S GONNA BE FINE, OKAY?
YOU'RE GONNA BE FINE.

251
00:14:05,553 --> 00:14:08,513
THIS WHOLE THING IS
GONNA BE FINE, ALL RIGHT?

252
00:14:11,725 --> 00:14:13,059
NO. NO!

253
00:14:13,102 --> 00:14:15,395
BAD JACKIE!

254
00:14:15,437 --> 00:14:17,397
BUT, HYDE, I THOUGHT WE AGREED

255
00:14:17,439 --> 00:14:20,441
THAT YOU WERE ALONE
AND I WAS ALONE...

256
00:14:22,361 --> 00:14:24,153
JACKIE, I'M TRYING TO HELP YOU
OUT HERE, ALL RIGHT?

257
00:14:24,196 --> 00:14:25,738
SO JUST LISTEN TO ME.

258
00:14:25,781 --> 00:14:28,283
YOU GOTTA REALIZE THAT YOU
CAN DO BETTER THAN KELSO.

259
00:14:28,325 --> 00:14:30,618
BUT WHAT IF I NEVER FIND
ANYBODY ELSE?

260
00:14:30,661 --> 00:14:33,663
OH, YOU WILL, MAN.
YOU'LL FIND SOMEBODY GREAT.

261
00:14:33,706 --> 00:14:38,251
YOU SEE, I, MYSELF,
DON'T LIKE YOU.

262
00:14:39,211 --> 00:14:41,087
I FIND YOU ABRASIVE.

263
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:45,967
BUT IF I DIDN'T KNOW YOU
AND I HAD NEVER TALKED TO YOU,

264
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:49,095
I'D THINK YOU WERE TOTALLY HOT.

265
00:14:50,681 --> 00:14:53,558
THANK YOU, HYDE.

266
00:14:53,601 --> 00:14:56,519
ANYTHING FOR YOU, DOLL.

267
00:15:00,107 --> 00:15:04,235
PEARL, HONEY, PLEASE COME OUT.

268
00:15:05,613 --> 00:15:11,242
OH! LAURIE, SHE KINDA LIKES
YOU. DO SOMETHING.

269
00:15:11,285 --> 00:15:13,494
AUNT PEARL!

270
00:15:13,537 --> 00:15:15,330
WHY DON'T YOU COME OUT,
AND YOU CAN SHOW ME

271
00:15:15,372 --> 00:15:18,207
YOUR DAMN SCRAPBOOKS AGAIN?

272
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:19,834
EVERY TIME YOU PEOPLE COME,

273
00:15:19,877 --> 00:15:21,920
I GOTTA GET DRESSED
AND PUT MY TEETH IN.

274
00:15:21,962 --> 00:15:25,173
AND YOU'RE NOT WORTH IT,
SO GET LOST!

275
00:15:29,219 --> 00:15:31,721
NOW CAN WE GO?

276
00:15:31,764 --> 00:15:34,098
NO. AHEM.

277
00:15:35,684 --> 00:15:37,685
OKAY, FINE. YOU KNOW WHAT?
I GIVE UP.

278
00:15:37,728 --> 00:15:39,395
LET'S JUST GO.

279
00:15:39,438 --> 00:15:43,942
I JUST HOPE WHEN I GET OLD,
SOMEONE COMES TO VISIT ME.

280
00:15:43,984 --> 00:15:46,945
DON'T BE RIDICULOUS, MOM.
ERIC WILL COME.

281
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:50,657
WELL, I'M GONNA GO WARM
THE CAR UP.

282
00:15:50,699 --> 00:15:52,283
NO, LAURIE.

283
00:15:52,326 --> 00:15:53,785
THIS IS IMPORTANT
TO YOUR MOTHER.

284
00:15:53,827 --> 00:15:56,454
SO SIT DOWN.

285
00:15:57,081 --> 00:16:00,124
COME ON, PEARL.
THERE'S A BUCKS GAME ON.

286
00:16:00,167 --> 00:16:02,418
THE BUCKS, HUH?!

287
00:16:03,337 --> 00:16:05,922
OH-HO!

288
00:16:09,176 --> 00:16:12,095
WELL, YOU KNOW, SEE?

289
00:16:12,137 --> 00:16:14,222
THIS IS NICE.

290
00:16:14,264 --> 00:16:15,974
THE ONLY THING
THAT KEEPS ME ALIVE

291
00:16:16,016 --> 00:16:19,686
IS WATCHING THE BUCKS LOSE.
PFFT!

292
00:16:23,857 --> 00:16:26,776
GO BUCKS.

293
00:16:28,112 --> 00:16:29,862
MICHAEL, NO. I DON'T
WANT TO TALK TO YOU.

294
00:16:29,905 --> 00:16:31,280
NO. YOU'RE RIGHT.

295
00:16:31,323 --> 00:16:32,949
OKAY? BECAUSE WORDS DON'T DO IT.

296
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:34,575
THAT'S WHY I WROTE THIS SONG.

297
00:16:34,618 --> 00:16:37,245

I CANNOT TAKE THIS ANYMORE.

YEAH. WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

311
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:28,254
UM, THIS IS MY SCHOOL SONG
FROM BACK HOME.

312
00:17:30,507 --> 00:17:33,092
I DON'T LOVE YOU.

313
00:17:34,636 --> 00:17:36,429
HEY, WHAT'S GOING ON?

314
00:17:36,472 --> 00:17:38,139
NOTHING.

315
00:17:38,182 --> 00:17:40,141
NOTHING AT ALL.

316
00:17:40,851 --> 00:17:42,477
THANK YOU, HYDE, FOR TONIGHT.

317
00:17:42,519 --> 00:17:44,854
IT WAS VERY SPECIAL.

318
00:17:51,445 --> 00:17:54,322
OHH! AIEE.

319
00:17:55,949 --> 00:17:58,618
ISN'T SHE NICE?

320
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:02,789
HEY, FELLAS, YOU
LIKE MY NEW BOOTS?

321
00:18:07,753 --> 00:18:10,088
SO, THEN ERIC SAYS TO DONNA,

322
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:11,589
"I CANNOT GO OUT WITH YOU,

323
00:18:11,632 --> 00:18:13,216
BECAUSE I'M GOING OUT
WITH THE GUYS."

324
00:18:13,258 --> 00:18:16,803
OH, JEEZ.

325
00:18:17,638 --> 00:18:20,014
WHAT? I DON'T THINK
THAT'S THE PROBLEM.

326
00:18:20,057 --> 00:18:23,851
NO. WHAT'S HIS NAME'S RIGHT.
THAT'S THE PROBLEM.

327
00:18:24,603 --> 00:18:26,270
LOOK, I DON'T THINK
I DID ANYTHING WRONG.

328
00:18:26,313 --> 00:18:27,647
I'M NOT GOING TO
APOLOGIZE TO DONNA.

329
00:18:27,689 --> 00:18:30,066
OH, YEAH?

330
00:18:31,652 --> 00:18:33,402
WHAT? WHY?

331
00:18:33,445 --> 00:18:34,821
HERE'S THE THING.

332
00:18:34,863 --> 00:18:37,698
YOU'RE ASSUMING THAT YOU'RE
GOOD ENOUGH FOR DONNA.

333
00:18:37,741 --> 00:18:40,326
AND YOU'RE NOT.

334
00:18:42,037 --> 00:18:43,371
YES, I AM.

335
00:18:43,413 --> 00:18:44,997
NO, YOU'RE NOT.

336
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:46,791
JUST LIKE I'M NOT
GOOD ENOUGH FOR YOUR MOTHER.

337
00:18:46,834 --> 00:18:48,501
OKAY, WELL...

338
00:18:48,544 --> 00:18:51,629
YEAH, THAT'S TRUE.

339
00:18:51,672 --> 00:18:53,840
HEY, WATCH IT. I'M TRYING TO
HELP YOU OUT HERE.

340
00:18:53,882 --> 00:18:55,424
I'M SORRY. YES, SIR.

341
00:18:55,467 --> 00:18:57,009
LOOK, DO YOU REALLY
THINK I WANTED TO SPEND

342
00:18:57,052 --> 00:18:58,845
THE WHOLE DAMN DAY
SITTING IN A ROOM

343
00:18:58,887 --> 00:19:03,099
WITH A WOMAN WHO HATES THE
BUCKS AND SMELLS LIKE CABBAGE?

344
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:04,851
WELL, I DIDN'T.

345
00:19:04,893 --> 00:19:07,728
BUT THAT'S THE PRICE
YOU PAY, SON.

346
00:19:08,605 --> 00:19:11,149
NOW, YOU GO CALL DONNA
BEFORE SHE REALIZES

347
00:19:11,191 --> 00:19:13,734
HOW MUCH BETTER OFF
SHE IS WITHOUT YOU.

348
00:19:15,195 --> 00:19:17,155
GO ON NOW. GO!

349
00:19:17,197 --> 00:19:20,575
GO! YOU HEARD HIM, GO!

350
00:19:21,076 --> 00:19:22,535
BUT WHAT ABOUT...

351
00:19:22,578 --> 00:19:25,580
BLAH, BLAH, BLAH.
MAKE THE CALL, LITTLE MAN.

352
00:19:33,630 --> 00:19:35,381
LISTEN, DONNA...

353
00:19:35,424 --> 00:19:36,716
NO. WAIT.

354
00:19:36,758 --> 00:19:39,468
I'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT...
YOU KNOW...

355
00:19:39,511 --> 00:19:41,304
WHAT HAPPENED.

356
00:19:41,346 --> 00:19:44,390
AND I REALIZE
I MAY HAVE OVERREACTED.

357
00:19:44,433 --> 00:19:46,225
IT'S JUST THAT I'M
A LITTLE VULNERABLE NOW

358
00:19:46,268 --> 00:19:50,146
THAT OUR RELATIONSHIP
IS... MATURED.

359
00:19:51,481 --> 00:19:55,109
DONNA, NO APOLOGY NECESSARY.

360
00:19:55,152 --> 00:19:58,196
I WELCOME YOUR INSANE
BEHAVIOR AND CRITICISM.

361
00:20:02,451 --> 00:20:04,368
DON'T BE A JERK, ERIC.

362
00:20:04,411 --> 00:20:07,622
NO. NO. UH, AHEM, I'M
ACTUALLY... I'M BEING SERIOUS.

363
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:10,416
I'M WILLING TO DO...

364
00:20:10,459 --> 00:20:13,377
WHATEVER IT TAKES
FOR US TO BE TOGETHER.

365
00:20:14,087 --> 00:20:16,380
WHATEVER IT TAKES.

366
00:20:16,423 --> 00:20:18,758
IT'S WORTH IT.

367
00:20:19,885 --> 00:20:22,929
WELL... THANK YOU.

368
00:20:24,389 --> 00:20:27,600
SO, UH, FOR FUTURE REFERENCE,

369
00:20:27,643 --> 00:20:30,645
DO I HAVE TO ASK YOU,
UH, BEFORE I GO OUT

370
00:20:30,687 --> 00:20:33,397
WITH MY FRIENDS?

371
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,483
NO.

372
00:20:35,525 --> 00:20:40,029
UH... YES.

373
00:20:40,072 --> 00:20:42,531
SOMETIMES.

374
00:20:42,574 --> 00:20:46,744
SO, UH, HOW WILL I
KNOW WHICH TIMES?

375
00:20:46,787 --> 00:20:49,956
WELL, YOU'LL KNOW AFTERWARDS
WHEN I GET MAD.

376
00:20:52,542 --> 00:20:54,502
OKAY. YEAH.

377
00:20:54,544 --> 00:20:56,754
UH, IS THERE, YOU KNOW,

378
00:20:56,797 --> 00:21:00,591
MAYBE A BETTER SYSTEM THAN THAT?

379
00:21:00,634 --> 00:21:03,761
NO. I REALLY CAN'T
THINK OF ONE. NO.

380
00:21:03,804 --> 00:21:06,973
OKAY, FAIR ENOUGH.

381
00:21:07,015 --> 00:21:09,183
I'M REALLY SORRY.

382
00:21:09,226 --> 00:21:11,644
ME, TOO.

383
00:21:11,687 --> 00:21:14,772
SO, UH, I BLEW OFF
THE GUYS TONIGHT

384
00:21:14,815 --> 00:21:16,399
TO HANG OUT WITH YOU.

385
00:21:16,441 --> 00:21:18,567
SO MY CALENDAR IS WIDE OPEN.

386
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:22,488
I'M... I'M HERE FOR YOU, DONNA.

387
00:21:22,531 --> 00:21:26,284
OH, THAT'S TOO BAD.
I'M HANGING OUT WITH JACKIE.

388
00:21:26,326 --> 00:21:29,161
YOU COULD COME IF YOU WANT.

389
00:21:31,164 --> 00:21:39,164
THAT'S REALLY NOT FUNNY.

390
00:21:42,175 --> 00:21:43,884
SO, AUNT PE...

391
00:21:43,927 --> 00:21:46,012
SHH!

392
00:21:46,054 --> 00:21:49,598
CAPTIONING MADE POSSIBLE BY CARSEY-WERNER
PRODUCTIONS AND FOX BROADCASTING COMPANY

393
00:22:03,864 --> 00:22:05,281
I WAS WONDERING...

394
00:22:05,324 --> 00:22:07,742
SHH! OKAY.
