From a magazine,
not the Internet?

I respect that.

517

Why'd you tear it up?

518
00:22:41,694 --> 00:22:44,462
Because as a woman,
I was totally offended.

of growin' up.

of our babysitter's face on it.

Okay. That's sick.
He needs help.

Yes.

or just the masturbator?

Uh-huh.

and her "friend"
just paid a visit.

Okay. Well, these are
for a much older "friend."

A much heavier "friend"

557

than your daughter has.

558
