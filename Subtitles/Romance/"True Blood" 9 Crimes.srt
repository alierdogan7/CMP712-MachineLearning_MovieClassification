1
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:10,080
Don't take it personally.

2
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:14,520
The Were you were fighting
had vampire blood in him.

3
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:18,040
Bill's, in fact,
so I know it's strong.

4
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:21,560
Werewolves doing V?

5
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:24,840
Goes against everything
we stand for.

6
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:29,080
- The rest of the pack into that shit?
- The ones who took Bill, at least.

7
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:31,880
Like I need more reasons
to hate them.

8
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:39,400
Is Debbie your ex-girlfriend?

9
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:41,960
She's my fiancée.

10
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:44,880
She moved out a month ago.

11
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:45,960
A month?

12
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:48,440
And you still haven't got
new furniture?

13
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:50,240
I don't have time for it.

14
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:54,560
You ever hear from her?

15
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:57,720
My sister, Janice, does.

16
00:00:58,200 --> 00:00:59,880
She runs a beauty parlor.

17
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:03,240
Debbie still goes in
to get her hair done up.

18
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:15,760
Almost done.

19
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:35,280
Are you hurt?
I know the werewolves have you.

20
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:36,640
Nobody has me.

21
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:38,880
I have left my life in Bon Temps.

22
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:41,440
And I am leaving you.

23
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:43,560
Shut the fuck up.

24
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:47,400
The last time I saw you,

25
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:49,560
you asked me to marry you.

26
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:52,840
You did us both a favor
by not saying yes.

27
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,480
You have to say that.

28
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:57,520
Someone's listening.

29
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:58,680
<i>Lorena, actually,</i>

30
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:00,760
to whom I have just made love.

31
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:02,080
<i>Ça va, Sookie?</i>

32
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:05,440
<i>We fucked
like only two vampires can.</i>

33
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,400
I didn't hold back
for fear of hurting her

34
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:09,720
like I do with you.

35
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:14,920
Look at your life
since I entered it.

36
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:17,240
I've only caused you pain.

37
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:18,680
That's not true.

38
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:19,840
I am death.

39
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:23,400
I will bring you only suffering.

40
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,600
<i>Our worlds are too different.</i>

41
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:27,120
Our natures too.

42
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:29,960
We were doomed from the start.

43
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:32,760
I don't believe you.

44
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:34,040
<i>Believe what you want.</i>

45
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:36,600
You are no longer of concern to me.

46
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:39,800
Do not try to find me.

47
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:41,720
<i>I do not wish to be found.</i>

48
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:26,320
What does he mean,
he doesn't wanna be found?

49
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:29,800
I'm pretty sure it means
he doesn't wanna see you anymore.

50
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,440
That isn't what he said.

51
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:33,640
- What do you think he said?
- I don't know what he said.

52
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:36,040
I just know that isn't
the man I love.

53
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:40,120
Maybe the man you love
never existed except in your head.

54
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,480
Is that supposed
to be making me feel better?

55
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:45,280
No matter how well
you think you know somebody,

56
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:48,320
they can still turn around
and kick you right in the nut sac.

57
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:52,360
I don't have a nut sac, and Bill...

58
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,160
he's risked everything for me.

59
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:58,520
Our love is way bigger

60
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:01,200
than him breaking up with me
over the phone.

61
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,080
How many relationships you been in?

62
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:05,600
What does that matter?

63
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:09,080
All I'm saying is there's no nice way
of getting out of these things.

64
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:16,760
Come here.

65
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:21,360
Oh, my God, you're so warm.

66
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,600
It's okay, I'm just not used to it.

67
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:26,800
It's a Were thing.

68
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,600
We run hot.

69
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:33,400
I thought maybe
you were coming down with the flu.

70
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,680
You probably want some privacy.

71
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:44,680
That's the last thing I want.

72
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:51,240
At least let me go put on a shirt.

73
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:57,480
Get back here, you little shit!

74
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,800
Were you sleeping in my parking lot?

75
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:35,520
We hadn't left yet because...

76
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:37,120
well...

77
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:39,000
we got nowhere to go.

78
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:41,120
We're a little behind in rent.

79
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:43,520
Plus, our landlord
got foreclosed on.

80
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:47,800
That's why you came here.
To eat my food and steal from me.

81
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:50,800
Tommy tried to break into my safe.

82
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:51,720
Shit.

83
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:55,480
Sometimes I think that boy's cheese
done slid right off his cracker.

84
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:59,800
He does desperate things
when we fall on hard times.

85
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:02,160
When you fall?
How often does this happen?

86
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:04,720
I don't wanna know.
This is not my problem.

87
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:07,080
I know it ain't.
Just please

88
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:08,600
don't take it out on Tommy.

89
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:13,120
- What happened now?
- No one's hurt.

90
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:15,320
Sam caught Tommy stealing.

91
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:17,680
Oh, that boy makes my ass itch.

92
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:23,160
I ain't asking for your sympathy.

93
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:25,160
I can't have you living
in my parking lot.

94
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:27,480
No, we'll be gone
the second he gets back.

95
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:29,280
He's just off somewhere
being himself up.

96
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:32,760
Won't be long.

97
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:34,880
It better not be.

98
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:47,640
Tell me everything you know
about Bill and Sookie.

99
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:50,480
She says it was love at first sight.

100
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:53,080
- You don't believe that?
- In love?

101
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:54,400
Hell, no.

102
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:57,000
People just get what they want
and leave.

103
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,520
And what does Sookie want?

104
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:00,040
Quiet.

105
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,240
Being a telepath gets real noisy,

106
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,080
and she can't hear Bill.

107
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:08,120
Her brother, is he a telepath too?

108
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:11,720
Jason barely knows
what he's thinking,

109
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:13,560
let alone anyone else.

110
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:16,280
If you keep smiling like that,
I'm gonna get jealous.

111
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:20,160
I thought I loved him
for a long time

112
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,840
but he never loved me back.

113
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,680
Then he is an idiot.

114
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:35,680
- Where is Sookie now?
- Jackson, Mississippi.

115
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:37,360
- Where in Jackson?
- I don't know.

116
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:38,640
Find out.

117
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:54,400
<i>You sound awful.</i>

118
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:56,360
Bill...

119
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:58,760
broke up with me.

120
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:01,000
<i>Oh, my God.
What an asshole.</i>

121
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:03,880
Tell me where you are.
I'm coming to get you.

122
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:06,920
No, I just need to cry my eyes out
for about a week.

123
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:09,600
What you need
is your best friend, right now.

124
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:11,040
Give me your address.

125
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:13,040
After all you've been through?

126
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,520
I don't want you
getting mixed up in my mess.

127
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:18,520
You'd do it for me. I'm getting
in the car right now.

128
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:19,760
Address.

129
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,480
I'm exhausted.

130
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:23,800
I'll call you tomorrow, I promise.

131
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:29,920
What do you want from Sookie?

132
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:33,880
You should be more concerned
with what I want from you.

133
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:35,360
Let me go.

134
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,160
Not gonna happen.

135
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:48,120
That was the best sex
I've had in decades.

136
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:51,640
At least somebody enjoyed it.

137
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:56,360
There was true passion
between you and I tonight.

138
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:00,200
Any passion you felt was me
killing my love for Sookie.

139
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:02,800
It had nothing to do with you.

140
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:08,120
It's been a long night,
and I need to sleep.

141
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:09,880
Now get the fuck out.

142
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:17,400
I'm happy.

143
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:20,040
You're with me.

144
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:23,200
And you're not going anywhere.

145
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:26,240
Even if it takes 40 years,

146
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,120
I know you will love me again.

147
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:35,520
You can't help but love.

148
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,000
Cheese and rice.

149
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:03,000
You scared me half to death.

150
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:10,160
- What the hell are you doing out there?
- Waiting for you to invite me in.

151
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:12,760
Can all vampires fly?

152
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:14,560
Can all humans sing?

153
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:15,840
Are you kidding?

154
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:18,000
Couldn't carry a tune
in a bucket with a lid on it.

155
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:22,160
Come on in.

156
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:28,160
How goes the search?

157
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:30,520
Turns out,

158
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:32,560
he's not who I was looking for.

159
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:42,960
You smell like the ocean in winter.

160
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:45,800
How is that possible?

161
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:48,040
Bill doesn't smell like anything.

162
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,360
That's not possible.

163
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:51,960
You played by the North Sea
as a child.

164
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,280
How did you know?

165
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,680
I'm smelling your memories.

166
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:00,960
Not even you can do that.

167
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:05,240
I got skills you can't even dream of,
cowboy.

168
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:23,440
You want more?

169
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:26,040
You want more?

170
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:29,040
Or I boring you?

171
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:36,560
That'll be all.

172
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,920
<i>... The Vampire Rights
Amendment's impending passing</i>

173
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:54,720
<i>has left many up in arms,
but perhaps none so much...</i>

174
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:57,440
What time you wanna head back
to Bon Temps?

175
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:01,880
Since you're not looking
for that asshole anymore.

176
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,840
I still plan on finding him.

177
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:06,040
Okay, doormat.

178
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:07,680
I'm not a doormat.

179
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:10,080
I just want him to say it
to my face.

180
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:12,480
- What, he didn't hurt you enough?
- I think he's in trouble.

181
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:15,960
Maybe I'm wrong, but if he can
look me and tell me it's over,

182
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:17,240
then I'll leave him.

183
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:19,840
You looking for closure?
Just let it go, move on.

184
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,480
Says the man cooking in a wok

185
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,400
because he's too sad
to buy a new frying pan.

186
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:27,360
I need more information.
Take me to that engagement party.

187
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:28,680
No fucking way.

188
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:31,400
I paid my debt.

189
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:33,400
I know you're still
hurting over Debbie.

190
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:36,080
Seeing her with those creeps
might help you get over her.

191
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:37,160
Are you insane?

192
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:39,280
Either one of us showing up
after last night

193
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:41,080
is just asking to get
our asses kicked.

194
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:46,040
You go if you gotta.
Don't put your shit on me.

195
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:52,320
Ring, ring, hooker.
Ring, ring.

196
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:55,280
Now, I know
you holing up at Sookie's,

197
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:57,000
but long story short,

198
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:59,320
I gots me a six-figure bucket seat

199
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:02,080
cradling my black ass
right the fuck now.

200
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:04,720
And you got yourself my old ride.

201
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,520
That's right, Buddha done did us
a 180, he did.

202
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:10,160
Now, why don't you calls
a motherfucker back, please?

203
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:12,000
Shit.

204
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:38,400
You must be Janice.

205
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:40,000
And you're Sookie Stackhouse?

206
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:42,720
Thank you, Jesus.

207
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:44,520
I'd have settled
for a two-bit hooker

208
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:46,960
to get my brother's mind off
that bitch Debbie Pelt,

209
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:48,280
but you are cute

210
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:49,960
and sweet.

211
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:51,640
You're just what he needs.

212
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:55,680
Thanks for coming over.

213
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:57,520
When you called,
I was checking my horoscope.

214
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:59,000
Do you know what it said?

215
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:01,200
"Things are looking up
for somebody close to you."

216
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:02,920
Nailed it.

217
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:06,520
Don't get too excited.
Alcide and I are just working together.

218
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:09,400
You don't look like
you work construction to me.

219
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:12,280
Someone I care about's gone missing,
and Alcide...

220
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,560
has inside information
about the folks I think have him.

221
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:20,440
I called you because I need to get
into Lou Pine's without standing out.

222
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:21,920
You need to look the part.

223
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:23,960
Well, that is my specialty.

224
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:27,080
How deep do you wanna go?

225
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:29,160
I wanna look like
I could kick some serious ass.

226
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:31,280
Which I can.

227
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:35,360
All right, let's pick out
some temporary tattoos.

228
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:38,080
No chance of anything more
between you and my baby brother?

229
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:39,360
I'm not really looking,

230
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:41,080
and he's still hung up on his ex.

231
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:44,200
Finding out about her engagement party
did not help matters.

232
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:46,240
Yeah, right, engagement party.

233
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:47,600
Excuse me?

234
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:50,160
No, right. That's right,
engagement party.

235
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:51,960
<i>That bitch Debbie's getting herself</i>

236
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:54,000
<i>initiated into
that nasty pack of freaks.</i>

237
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:57,520
- How did Al find out about it?
- Hollis told him last night.

238
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:59,280
<i>Fucking Hollis and his big mouth.</i>

239
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:02,200
<i>I'm glad he didn't say nothing
about her being hooked on V.</i>

240
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:06,760
But if Alcide still loves Debbie

241
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:08,960
don't you think he should go
and try to...

242
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:11,760
- talk her out of it?
- No, he should not.

243
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:15,480
My psychic told him if he stayed
with her, he would get himself killed.

244
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:18,480
Did he listen? No.
She ended up dumping his ass.

245
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:20,160
Why'd he stay with her so long?

246
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:23,200
She was his first love,
he never met anybody so alive,

247
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:24,280
all that shit.

248
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:27,360
But how many bullets
are you gonna take for somebody?

249
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:30,080
How many bad things gotta happen
to you and the ones you love

250
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:31,280
before you realize

251
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:33,360
feeling alive ain't enough?

252
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:37,600
I am just glad he made it out alive.

253
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:44,160
Arlene, what's happening, baby?

254
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:47,120
I'm trying to buy my crew here a round
after a long day.

255
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:49,280
A long day?
It's lunch, okay?

256
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:52,320
And I'm the only waitress working,
as usual.

257
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:54,320
You'll get your beer
when you get it.

258
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:55,640
Where's she takin' it?

259
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:57,160
Right here.

260
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:58,880
QB 1 gets the first beer.

261
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:06,400
Who's that cocky little shit?

262
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:09,560
You're mad
because he's about to break

263
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:11,720
your passing record.
He's close.

264
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:14,800
Say he's got the best arm
of any kid in Bon Temps since...

265
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:16,760
Well, since you.

266
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:19,880
What's his name?

267
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,160
Kitch Maynard.

268
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:23,160
Don't even think
about finishing that pitcher.

269
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:25,200
Fucking winning name.

270
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:27,080
Get on up here, Bud.
Get up here, young man.

271
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,680
I'm gonna keep it short.

272
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:34,440
Everything I learned
about being a good cop,

273
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,480
I learned from you.

274
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:39,160
You always been a hell
of a sheriff, Bud,

275
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:41,080
and I'm gonna miss you.
Kevin.

276
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:44,960
We figured, since you hung up
your hat for good,

277
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:48,600
it's time
you put on your new dancing shoes.

278
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:57,400
Thank you.
They're beautiful.

279
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:02,080
It's been a great honor
serving this community.

280
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:06,160
And it's an even greater honor

281
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:08,040
having served with such fine men.

282
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:09,520
And woman.

283
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:12,240
And it is in that spirit
that I announce to you

284
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:14,000
your new acting sheriff...

285
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:23,080
That's how you drink a beer.

286
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:24,680
That's a surprise.

287
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:26,280
And a hell of an honor.

288
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:32,600
It's Kitch, right?

289
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:34,600
Around here they call me QB 1.

290
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:37,160
But you probably can't remember that
far back, can you?

291
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:39,360
- What's your name?
- Tammy.

292
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,200
You are smoking.

293
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:45,760
You got all them dimples.

294
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:47,440
I'd have made out with you,

295
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:48,920
but unfortunately for you,

296
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:51,440
you're with a disrespectful
fucktard...

297
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:55,080
... who's causing a ruckus
when a fine, upstanding citizen

298
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,840
is getting all commemorated.

299
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:02,920
You think you're a rock star,
don't you?

300
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:04,600
World at your feet,

301
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:06,720
folks serving you beer underage.

302
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:10,040
Girls sucking your cock whenever
you say go. No offense, Tammy.

303
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:12,600
You ain't nothing, boy.

304
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:14,760
You'll find that out soon enough.

305
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:18,440
Yeah, well, come end of season,
they'll be shouting my name,

306
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:20,520
and they'll forget you ever existed.

307
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:24,920
But 10 years from now,

308
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:27,080
there's gonna be a version of you,

309
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:29,280
10 years younger,
doing the same thing to you.

310
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:32,160
And then who you gonna be?

311
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:33,440
What?

312
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:35,920
Yeah, that's right.
You heard me.

313
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:39,880
Touchdown.

314
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:42,800
Well, I guess the only way
to get a promotion in this town

315
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:44,080
is to drink like a fish,

316
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:46,120
hallucinate farm animals,

317
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:47,360
and kill a black man.

318
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:48,680
Promotion.

319
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:51,200
Pig!

320
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:56,440
- Here, let me help you.
- God, you wanna help me?

321
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:58,000
How about doing your job, boss?

322
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:02,440
Right now I'm a hostess,
waitress, bartender,

323
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:04,880
busboy,
because everybody you hire

324
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:08,520
comes to work whenever they fucking feel
like it or ends up dead.

325
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:10,760
And I've got enough
on my plate without...

326
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:13,120
I'll get someone else in here
soon enough, okay?

327
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:16,440
You have got to start looking
out for your own, Sam.

328
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:25,000
In here.

329
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:33,600
I guess my sister took to you.

330
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:37,080
Debbie's getting initiated into
Coot's pack, and she's addicted to V.

331
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:38,760
Shut the fucking door.

332
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:40,880
Debbie's a bloodhead?
How'd you find out?

333
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:42,640
I was poking around
in Janice's brain.

334
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:45,440
She didn't tell you
because she's trying to protect you.

335
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:48,520
- Why don't you let her?
- Because I know you care about Debbie.

336
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:51,640
No matter what she did to you.
You'd wanna know if she were in danger.

337
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:54,400
She's gonna let
those fucking mongrels brand her.

338
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:57,360
- V's the only reason. It's gotta be.
- Of course it is.

339
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:59,960
Maybe it's not too late
for you to get through to her.

340
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:01,560
Stop her from ruining her life.

341
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:02,640
Fuck!

342
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:06,400
That mean you're coming with me?

343
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:10,000
I probably won't get in otherwise.

344
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:11,920
Fine.

345
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:14,320
We're gonna have to go
in separate, though.

346
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:16,920
You might be able to fool some
with that getup.

347
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:20,040
They're just gonna
beat the shit out of me, again.

348
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:28,360
How long did you work
for Sophie Anne?

349
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:31,200
- Thirty-five years.
- As?

350
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:33,920
I was a procurer.

351
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:37,200
Were you any good?

352
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:39,600
I received no complaints.

353
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:43,240
And then you started sampling
the local flavor in Bon Temps.

354
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:45,640
I was on sabbatical.

355
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:48,960
Well, now you're
playing coy, William.

356
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:52,120
So which is it you doubt,
my intentions

357
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:54,960
or my power?

358
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,720
Can you assure me that you will be able
to usurp her territory?

359
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:03,120
That depends
on the quality of your information,

360
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:04,440
now, doesn't it?

361
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:06,680
I insist.

362
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:14,720
"A woman

363
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:16,160
"is only a woman,

364
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:18,600
"but a good cigar

365
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:21,360
"is a smoke."

366
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:25,200
Rudyard Kipling.

367
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:28,480
No Shakespeare, but less impetuous.

368
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:31,160
And he never stole spoons.

369
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:35,400
Your Majesty,

370
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:37,600
if I am going to sign
my own death warrant

371
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:39,160
I will need something in return.

372
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:46,040
When I have fulfilled my duties,

373
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:48,280
I want Lorena gone.

374
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:49,920
Gone?

375
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:55,640
It is a punishable offense
to kill another vampire.

376
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:57,360
Not if no one reports it.

377
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:09,760
Eric Northman,

378
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:12,360
the queen's sheriff of Area 5,

379
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:15,160
has been selling vampire blood,

380
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:17,760
and I believe it is at her behest.

381
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:22,280
If the Magister finds out,
he'll put her on trial.

382
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:25,400
He's been itching
for another inquisition for centuries.

383
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:28,000
Why on earth would she be so stupid?

384
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:29,960
The Great Revelation.

385
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:34,120
She's close to losing her fortune
now that we're being taxed by the IRS.

386
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:40,760
Tug on the purse strings,
you'll find a lady's heart.

387
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:49,960
That's very nice, Bill.

388
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:52,320
Very nice.

389
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:57,080
I feel like celebrating.

390
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:23,480
Missed you.

391
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:36,360
You miss me?

392
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:46,640
Did you miss me?

393
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:57,720
I can't stop thinking about you.

394
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:00,920
Something about you is just so...

395
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:03,160
What's the word?

396
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:06,480
Motherfucker.

397
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:08,280
Magical.

398
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:19,160
We have so much ahead of us.

399
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,960
When people come in, first thing,
count how many of them there are.

400
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:31,600
More than two always gets a table,
never the bar.

401
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:32,960
So say there's three.

402
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:36,120
Pull out one, two, three menus
and walk them to their table.

403
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:39,240
What about the waitressing part?

404
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:41,360
You gotta be 18 to serve alcohol.

405
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:44,520
That is so not fair.
I'm never gonna be 18.

406
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:46,960
I used to be the best server
at our church pancake night.

407
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:51,640
- Think you can handle it?
- I'm a vampire, not a fucking idiot.

408
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,320
Hi, welcome to Merlotte's.
Table 5's available.

409
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:57,200
If you'll just follow me
right this way.

410
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:03,240
A hostess ain't gonna help me
with my workload.

411
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:05,600
And she sure as heck ain't
helping herself to my tips.

412
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:06,560
Calm down.

413
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:09,000
I put an ad for another waitress.

414
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:11,160
No one said anything
about Jessica getting tips.

415
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:13,280
People love giving redheads tips.

416
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:17,240
And I've always been
the only redhead at Merlotte's, Sam.

417
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:18,560
You know that.

418
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:20,920
Sorry.

419
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:24,600
I get a little emotional when I'm...

420
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:27,280
When I see people

421
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:29,280
taking advantage of you.

422
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:31,960
What are you talking about?

423
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:35,080
You let in every stray, Sam.

424
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:37,680
First that old dog,
and then your folks,

425
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:39,240
and now Jessica.

426
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:42,480
I mean, it's your business.
It's not a charity.

427
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:44,040
I can take care of myself.

428
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:45,800
My folks won't be
coming around anymore.

429
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:48,560
You sure they know that?
They're grilling in the parking lot.

430
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:55,280
One thing's for sure:

431
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:57,680
we'll never be as bad
of parents as they are.

432
00:26:57,800 --> 00:26:59,760
Your server will
be right with you, all right?

433
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:02,560
- Excuse me.
- Sorry.

434
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:10,880
- No, you've got me confused, I think.
- Jessica, it's Chip from Bible study.

435
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:15,920
Hi. Oh, my God.

436
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:20,200
I can't believe you're alive.
Your folks are gonna be so happy.

437
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:24,600
- My God, it's a miracle.
- Yeah, I guess so.

438
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:26,200
Praise Jesus. Praise him.

439
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:31,280
You shitting me?

440
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:33,720
My little brother
just got busted dealing dope.

441
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:35,840
You won't find a better product.

442
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:38,560
- You a cop?
- No, sir.

443
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:40,880
I know your boy's a lean,
mean selling machine.

444
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,560
I'm just here to up your game.

445
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:44,360
Help you step up in the world,

446
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:46,520
clean some shit up.

447
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
I'll go grab the Dirt Devil
from Felton.

448
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:55,720
- See if he's hungry too.
- I ain't his mama.

449
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:57,760
What do you say?

450
00:27:57,920 --> 00:27:58,960
You feel me?

451
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:04,640
Nothing this hot
will cost you this little

452
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:06,720
and earn you so much.

453
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:10,680
We're not getting in business
with people like you.

454
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:12,520
People like me?

455
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:15,160
- Look...
- No, you look, son.

456
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:20,040
Polite's in short supply around here.
It's time you get your ass home.

457
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:25,400
Ain't you pretty, princess?

458
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:29,120
- Get the fuck up out my ride.
- How about no?

459
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:31,760
- How about I whup your fucking ass?
- Faggot.

460
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:33,680
I told you we ain't
so polite around here.

461
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:53,440
How'd you end up
in Bon Temps tonight?

462
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:55,720
I was just on my way home
back from picketing

463
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:58,320
the baby-killer factory
up in Birmingham.

464
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:00,640
Stopped for a bite.

465
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:03,080
You wanted to stop for a bite

466
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:04,920
but you decided it was too late,

467
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:06,600
so you drove straight home.

468
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:08,800
It is late.

469
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:13,920
Then you got a little lost
on the 165,

470
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:16,240
and that's why you got home
a little late

471
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:17,480
and a little hungry.

472
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:19,880
And you never even saw me.

473
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:23,800
I hate being hungry before bed.

474
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:34,320
Take that.

475
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
Get your fucking hands off me,
dead man.

476
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:46,360
- Take the deal.
- You'll have to kill me first.

477
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:49,520
I think I'll kill
all your brother-cousins first.

478
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:52,840
- How does that sound, Lafayette?
- That sounds good.

479
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:55,400
- Excellent.
- We'll sell.

480
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:57,440
Just let me fucking go.

481
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:02,240
And that's called closing the deal.

482
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:07,240
Let's go, RuPaul.

483
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:11,680
Get the fuck up out of here.

484
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:18,200
What do you want
with Sookie and Bill?

485
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:19,280
Nothing.

486
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:23,320
My employer's interested in them.
Him, mostly.

487
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,320
That where we're going?
To your employer?

488
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:30,600
"Slappy's Snack Shack, five miles.
Persimmons and cherries."

489
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:36,360
If there is one thing
that I miss more than sunshine,

490
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:37,680
it is good fruit.

491
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:39,160
Where are you taking me?

492
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:41,440
Here I am trying to make
pleasant conversation,

493
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:43,040
and you wanna ruin all my surprises.

494
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:46,760
There ain't nothing pleasant
about being bitten and tied up.

495
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:47,880
You're tough.

496
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:50,120
I could taste it in your blood.

497
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:53,360
I'm not a bad guy, Tara.

498
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:55,880
I just wanna make sure
that we have a chance.

499
00:30:57,320 --> 00:30:59,960
Untie my hands.
I'll give you whatever chance you want.

500
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:02,680
Are you like this
with your other boyfriends?

501
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:04,640
This is kidnapping.

502
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:06,480
This is opportunity.

503
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:11,320
My job supports my financial needs.

504
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:13,040
My emotional ones.

505
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:18,560
It's just there's so much
I wanna tell you.

506
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:20,640
Then tell me where we're going.

507
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:22,640
I've been so lonely.

508
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:25,400
But now you're mine...

509
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:28,120
all that's changed.

510
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:55,000
I figured the sooner you left Bon Temps,
the happier you'd be.

511
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:58,040
Unless you plan
on stealing from me more.

512
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:01,840
You don't know shit about me.

513
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:07,760
I know you got
a pretty raw deal with your folks.

514
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:12,040
I know you think I got off easy.

515
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:14,600
Why'd you even look us up, anyway?

516
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:23,280
When I was your age...

517
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:26,360
I had no example.

518
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:31,720
And everything I did...

519
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:35,280
Shit that was worse
than stealing, by the way.

520
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:36,520
... I did blind.

521
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:39,200
And I survived,

522
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:42,480
but it caught up with me so bad,
sometimes I wished I hadn't.

523
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:45,840
Guess I wanted to see
how different it could have been.

524
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:48,560
And now that you have?

525
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:52,440
I see that I can't get back
what I lost.

526
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:55,360
But you're still young,

527
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:59,240
and you don't have to make
the same mistakes.

528
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:01,880
And you could stay with me.

529
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:05,320
- I could set you up at the bar.
- You don't get it.

530
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:08,560
My folks are fucked up,
but they can't get by without me.

531
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:11,120
Now, I know it feels like that,
but they're not your problem.

532
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:12,440
That's all they are.

533
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:14,400
I ditch them tomorrow,

534
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:16,640
they end up in the gutter
by the end of next week.

535
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:18,320
You think I can live with that?

536
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:24,520
I won't be free of these people
until the day they die.

537
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:30,600
I have to say
I'm a little disappointed, Lafayette.

538
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:32,360
I pegged you as a professional,

539
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:35,960
but clearly, you lack
the necessary artistry.

540
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:39,960
Bossman, have you seen this face?

541
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:42,040
It ain't nothing but art.

542
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:45,080
You walk into every situation
all flash and fire.

543
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:47,200
You expect them to adapt to you.

544
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:49,120
That's not salesmanship.

545
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:50,680
It's ego.

546
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:57,880
<i>- What?
- We're being raided.</i>

547
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:09,240
<i>That is the Magister.</i>

548
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:19,840
Come out, come out,
wherever you are.

549
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,360
Magister.
What a pleasant surprise.

550
00:34:23,640 --> 00:34:25,840
There's nothing pleasant about this.

551
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:27,480
This...

552
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:29,320
is blasphemy.

553
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:31,720
Take her.

554
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:35,560
I know I ain't got no fangs,

555
00:34:35,680 --> 00:34:38,040
and I know I can't talk
whatever language

556
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:40,960
that is you talk in,
but I can move your shit.

557
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:47,200
Oh, hell.

558
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:50,560
How am I supposed to deal
with this fucked-up-ness?

559
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:56,040
I wanna be a cop.
A real one.

560
00:34:56,440 --> 00:34:59,560
- That's good, Stackhouse.
- I've been old Jason long enough.

561
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:04,080
Apply yourself like I told you.
Someday you might make a good one.

562
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:10,840
No, I don't think you're hearing me.

563
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:13,600
You see, I'm not doing
them fake ride-alongs

564
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:15,240
and filling out forms.

565
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:18,440
I'm thinking
there's gotta be an easier way.

566
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:20,920
You've been thinking
that way your whole life, Stackhouse.

567
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:22,600
Where's it gotten you?

568
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:27,440
You're gonna make me a cop,
and you're gonna make me one now.

569
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:30,360
Even if I wanted to, I couldn't.
There's rules.

570
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:32,400
There any rules

571
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:35,440
about taking
TV interviews and promotions

572
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:37,720
for not shooting a killer dead

573
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
when I'm the one who's gotta
live with doing it?

574
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:41,480
Any rules about that?

575
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:43,840
I push this, it'll blow up
for the both of us.

576
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:46,640
You know, I read something
in all that cop homework

577
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:50,120
about when you make up stories
about murderers and crimes.

578
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:52,560
What do they call that again?

579
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:55,200
Falsifying evidence.

580
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:57,800
Falsifying the evidence.

581
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:00,680
Last few days,

582
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:03,520
shooting a known killer,

583
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:05,600
tackling a drug dealer in Hotshot.

584
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:10,120
I'm already the best cop you got,

585
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:12,040
Sheriff Andy Bellefleur.

586
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:20,560
Shit.

587
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:25,000
These dogs plumping up real good.

588
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:28,600
There you are.

589
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:30,920
Boy, I'll whup you.

590
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:39,360
Now, here's what's gonna happen.

591
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:43,240
I'm gonna give you a place to stay

592
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:46,120
for now
till you get back on your feet.

593
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:47,320
No more stealing,

594
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:50,400
no more drinking,

595
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:53,880
- or the deal's off.
- I think we can manage that.

596
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:57,720
Don't see why not.

597
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:02,200
Think you can fly
straight from now on?

598
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:05,600
Supposed to be a joke.

599
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:10,840
Maybe I can.

600
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:20,640
- Not you.
- Russell's expecting me.

601
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:22,800
He's out.
He'll be a while.

602
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:24,600
We'll wait.

603
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:28,640
Is this for me?

604
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:33,720
It's skinny.

605
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:54,040
<i>It's a private party.
Hollis ain't here.</i>

606
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:56,480
<i>We're on our own.</i>

607
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:09,280
- Shoot it.
- No, thanks.

608
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:11,440
<i>She looks familiar.
Did I bang her?</i>

609
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:13,840
Fuck, yeah!

610
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:19,760
- Again.
- Again.

611
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:26,520
One more.
Third time's the charm.

612
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:34,920
Who the fuck are you?

613
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:37,480
She's with me, Debbie.

614
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:49,760
In the mood for anything
in particular?

615
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:52,040
Someone smoky.

616
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:54,040
Not too fatty.

617
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:55,920
See, I was thinking...

618
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:58,040
ethnic.

619
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:03,200
You said you were a procurer?

620
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:12,800
Procure.

621
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:15,160
As you wish.

622
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:29,800
Let her go!

623
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:31,600
I am who you want.

624
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:34,240
But I have been framed.

625
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:37,480
"You've got the wrong man."

626
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:39,200
"My dog ate my homework."

627
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:41,040
"I saw Goody Osburn with the devil."

628
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:45,720
Excuses are one thing I can assure you
do not get better with age.

629
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:49,160
Do you deny the blood was being sold

630
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:51,880
in your area?

631
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:54,280
Not on my orders.

632
00:39:55,720 --> 00:39:56,880
Then on whose?

633
00:39:58,200 --> 00:39:59,280
Your queen's?

634
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:08,800
What shall it be, sheriff?

635
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:12,040
Desecration of the blood

636
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:15,680
or treason against your regent?

637
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:20,600
Both among the most dire of crimes.

638
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:29,400
It was Bill Compton!

639
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:34,400
It's true. He's gone missing.

640
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:38,280
You've seen yourself how easily
he betrays our kind for personal gain.

641
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:40,440
I believe he is behind this,

642
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:43,160
and I am gathering evidence
to bring him to you.

643
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:46,560
Now let me finish my work.

644
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,800
They say the loss of a child

645
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:54,680
is the deepest of despair.

646
00:40:57,240 --> 00:40:58,520
Two days, Mr. Northman,

647
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:01,280
or she dies.

648
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:06,920
A true death.

649
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:15,400
You thought this
knight-on-a-white-horse shit would work?

650
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:18,080
- With me?
- What have you done to yourself?

651
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:20,040
I finally got free of you.

652
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:22,280
And I never been happier in my life.

653
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:23,720
I still care about you.

654
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:27,720
- The pack will never let you back in.
- I don't need your pussy pack.

655
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:32,320
And I was fucking Coot
when I was still with you.

656
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:34,520
- This isn't about us.
- Like hell.

657
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:38,040
You came here and brought this skank
just to make me jealous.

658
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:39,160
Skank?

659
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:41,480
Well, coming from you,
that's just funny.

660
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:46,440
You did not just say that to me
at my own fucking party.

661
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:49,440
Alcide came here despite
every good reason in the world not to

662
00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:51,840
because he believes
the woman he fell in love with

663
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:53,960
still lives inside you somewhere.

664
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:56,560
He's willing to risk his life
to make sure you hold on to her,

665
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:58,160
even if he doesn't get to.

666
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:00,840
It isn't too late.

667
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:03,440
We can get out of here right now.

668
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:07,520
What the fuck is this?

669
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:11,000
- It's just a conversation, Coot.
- She's all done with you, Herveaux.

670
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:14,360
She went and found herself
a real wolf.

671
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:16,760
Come on.

672
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:18,480
Let's do this shit!

673
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:19,840
Leave him alone, Coot.

674
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:23,800
- Let him stay.
- No way in hell.

675
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:25,760
He needs to see this.

676
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:27,800
He ain't never gonna let us b baby,

677
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:30,360
till he understands
I'm with you for good.

678
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:05,240
He's one of the ones who took Bill.

679
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:09,720
I have...

680
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:12,560
an errand to attend to.

681
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:17,640
If I'm not back before Mr. Compton
returns with our dinner,

682
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:19,800
you feel free to start without me.

683
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:37,800
Who's that?

684
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:39,640
Russell Edgington.

685
00:44:39,880 --> 00:44:42,400
He's a rich antiques dealer here.

686
00:45:07,960 --> 00:45:10,240
What's a vampire doing
in a wolf den?

687
00:45:10,920 --> 00:45:12,840
Why are they submitting
to this fanger?

688
00:45:27,480 --> 00:45:28,760
He supplies them.

689
00:45:29,840 --> 00:45:31,600
Holy shit.

690
00:45:43,800 --> 00:45:45,400
Not tonight, pumpkin.

691
00:45:45,840 --> 00:45:46,920
Otherwise

692
00:45:47,080 --> 00:45:49,080
your brand don't last.

693
00:45:54,840 --> 00:45:55,800
Tonight...

694
00:45:57,200 --> 00:46:00,160
you continue the grand tradition
of expanding our pack.

695
00:46:01,320 --> 00:46:02,680
My contribution

696
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:05,840
is but a small token of gratitude

697
00:46:06,360 --> 00:46:08,880
for our collaboration
throughout the ages.

698
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:11,360
The ages?

699
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:17,360
Drink.

700
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:31,880
I leave you amongst your own

701
00:46:32,680 --> 00:46:33,800
to celebrate.

702
00:46:50,040 --> 00:46:51,000
All yours.

703
00:47:10,200 --> 00:47:11,880
- Shy?
- Perhaps.

704
00:47:13,080 --> 00:47:14,520
I'll take good care of you.

705
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:25,960
- What's your name?
- Destiny.

706
00:47:27,640 --> 00:47:28,840
What is your real name?

707
00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:30,840
Camilla.

708
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:38,040
What is your name?

709
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:39,840
Ann.

710
00:47:39,960 --> 00:47:42,480
What does your husband think
about your profession?

711
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:45,120
- No husband.
- Children?

712
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:47,760
Never wanted any.
World's too fucked up.

713
00:47:49,840 --> 00:47:52,000
- And your family?
- Told me I wasn't worth nothing.

714
00:47:52,120 --> 00:47:55,520
- I figured they ain't worth knowing.
- Perhaps you're right about that.

715
00:47:58,240 --> 00:47:59,240
No point anyway.

716
00:47:59,840 --> 00:48:00,680
What?

717
00:48:00,840 --> 00:48:02,000
Loving anyone,

718
00:48:03,480 --> 00:48:04,440
anything.

719
00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:08,360
Feels good at first,
but it always turns to crap.

720
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:12,760
I know the truth about life.

721
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:16,960
It's a hell I'll never
get out of alive.

722
00:48:19,160 --> 00:48:20,200
No one does.

723
00:48:43,120 --> 00:48:44,240
Debbie, you dumb bitch.

724
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:52,480
This is so fucking wrong.

725
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:33,480
What's happening?

726
00:49:35,080 --> 00:49:36,600
Are they all shifting?

727
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:38,720
You need to get out of here.

728
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:44,200
Sookie, run. Run!

729
00:49:51,800 --> 00:49:53,320
What have we got here?

730
00:49:55,520 --> 00:49:57,600
So, what kind of party we having?

731
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:19,720
- Ladies first.
- Why, thank you, Russell.

732
00:50:36,280 --> 00:50:37,480
Please join us.
