[beeping continues]

00:02:30,984 --> 00:02:32,818
[beeping stops]

6
00:02:41,327 --> 00:02:45,706
Hi.

7
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:54,590
Have we met somewhere before?
M m-hm, I don't think so.

8
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:58,218
M m.
[beeping]

9
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:02,097
Ah.
Late.

10
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:05,225
Very late, Anna. You put
the alarm back again.

11
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:08,353
[shower running]

12
00:03:08,438 --> 00:03:11,106
Stautenmeyer is calling into
the office this morning.

13
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:14,443
We're gonna talk to them
about making me partner.

14
00:03:14,527 --> 00:03:16,778
Wow. That's amazing.

15
00:03:16,863 --> 00:03:20,908
Yeah, you're gonna have to work on
being a little more corporate.

16
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:24,578
Yeah, work on this.
Jesus! Not funny.

17
00:03:24,662 --> 00:03:26,705
Ha ha.

18
00:03:26,789 --> 00:03:29,833
I n other news, the serial killer
now known as Tearjerk Jack...

19
00:03:29,918 --> 00:03:33,045
continues to spread terror
across the East Side.

20
00:03:33,129 --> 00:03:35,672
Police have verified the discovery
of a fifth victim...

21
00:03:35,757 --> 00:03:37,799
in the early hours this morning.

22
00:03:37,884 --> 00:03:41,094
We will continue to follow the
story for you as develop--

23
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:44,360
Shouldn't you be handing out gold
stars instead of earning yellow

24
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,474
ribbons on FarmVille?

25
00:03:45,558 --> 00:03:48,977
I was just checking pre-delays
in the subway.

26
00:03:54,442 --> 00:03:56,777
What do you think?

27
00:03:56,861 --> 00:03:59,196
I like it a little rough
, but I guess...

28
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:02,783
[German accent] M r. Stautenmeyer
likes his men a little different.

29
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:05,661
No, he does like it smooth.
[laughs]

30
00:04:25,181 --> 00:04:27,516
[woman over P.A.] Next stop.

31
00:04:31,062 --> 00:04:34,356
"A chance encounter with a
mysterious stranger...

32
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:38,110
could be a bridge to new
exciting opportunities."

33
00:04:42,865 --> 00:04:45,367
Wow, that looks like modern art.

34
00:04:45,451 --> 00:04:47,995
It's a little Picasso we've
got going over here.

35
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:55,210
(Anna) Whoa.
Oh, no. It's so not a big deal.

36
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:58,714
Why don't we get a sponge from over
there and clean it up, okay?

37
00:04:58,798 --> 00:05:01,008
All right.

38
00:05:06,556 --> 00:05:10,017
[children's muffled laughter]

39
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:17,316
Okay, got it.
[laughing] Woo! Woo!

40
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,234
I got you.

41
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:22,446
Oh, no, you got me.
Oh, no, you got me.

42
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:26,700
Hello. I am here to pick up--
Robert. He's in the sandpit.

43
00:05:26,784 --> 00:05:30,078
Oh, you're good. I don't know
how you tell them apart.

44
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:34,708
[cell phone rings]
Hello!

45
00:05:34,834 --> 00:05:37,377
(woman) Hi, Supernanny. Any hunklicious
divorcÃ©e to report...

46
00:05:37,462 --> 00:05:39,755
or are you too busy potty-training
their offspring?

47
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:43,425
You're so bad. I'm still
on the clock, you know.

48
00:05:43,509 --> 00:05:45,427
So, are you coming today?

49
00:05:45,511 --> 00:05:48,263
Yeah, it's Tuesday, right?
You bet your ass I am.

50
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:54,478
No, I'd rather drink the calories.
M m, six-and-a-half.

51
00:05:54,562 --> 00:05:56,938
Not too bad. I would say seven.

52
00:05:58,316 --> 00:06:00,484
Look left to the bar. Quick.

53
00:06:00,568 --> 00:06:03,904
Ten out of ten. Not too shabby.
Not too shabby at all.

54
00:06:03,988 --> 00:06:06,323
I wouldn't kick him out of
bed for eating crackers.

55
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:11,328
Or anything else.
Does that matter?

56
00:06:11,412 --> 00:06:15,749
Okay. So, I wanna know how was
Justin Timberlake last week?

57
00:06:15,833 --> 00:06:19,836
Hm. Had a few drinks.
Went back to his--

58
00:06:19,921 --> 00:06:22,589
Need I elaborate?

59
00:06:22,673 --> 00:06:25,550
I had more fun with
a broken vibrator.

60
00:06:25,635 --> 00:06:29,471
Does it ever get tiring
, being a slut?

61
00:06:29,555 --> 00:06:31,723
I'll tell you one thing
you never get tired of.

62
00:06:31,808 --> 00:06:35,227
That moment when you wake
up and for a second...

63
00:06:35,311 --> 00:06:39,648
you have no idea where you are or who
the hell the guy is next to you.

64
00:06:39,732 --> 00:06:41,733
I live for that stuff.

65
00:06:41,818 --> 00:06:44,611
I guess it complicates things
a little bit less, right?

66
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:47,614
Yeah.
I mean, sometimes with Bryce--

67
00:06:47,698 --> 00:06:49,408
No, enough with Bryce.

68
00:06:49,492 --> 00:06:51,368
If you're done with him
, just hand him over.

69
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:56,164
Come on, girls. Big smiles.
Just think in three months...

70
00:06:56,249 --> 00:06:59,376
we will be sipping those dirty
martinis on Laguna Beach.

71
00:07:01,295 --> 00:07:04,840
Hey, guys, I was-- I wanted
to tell you, but, um...

72
00:07:04,924 --> 00:07:08,009
I don't think I'm gonna be
able to make it this year.

73
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:10,345
What?
It's sacred.

74
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:12,222
It's a ritual.

75
00:07:12,306 --> 00:07:14,182
I know. It's just Bryce wants
to take us to Vegas...

76
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:16,643
to celebrate our first
year and stuff.

77
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:19,855
Classy.
He's so gonna pop the question.

78
00:07:19,939 --> 00:07:22,232
Okay, listen, we just
moved in together.

79
00:07:22,358 --> 00:07:24,960
And what are you waiting
for? Get dumped for some

80
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,236
skanky-ass cheerleader?

81
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:30,198
If he pulls out a ring, you
should snatch it, girl.

82
00:07:30,283 --> 00:07:32,242
Thank you.

83
00:07:32,326 --> 00:07:34,744
You know, once you've squeezed
out a couple of rug-rats...

84
00:07:34,829 --> 00:07:38,165
you'll fix up some money pit and
slide contentedly into senility.

85
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:43,128
Francine, for a second there...
I forgot why you're still single.

86
00:07:48,718 --> 00:07:50,760
[whispering] Oh, my
God, you guys.

87
00:07:50,845 --> 00:07:54,222
Mister "Ten-Out-of-Ten" over there
is totally checking me out.

88
00:07:56,267 --> 00:07:59,644
Oh, well, no sense in letting
him go to waste.

89
00:07:59,729 --> 00:08:01,897
Another drink.

90
00:08:01,981 --> 00:08:04,107
Yeah, I know, it's cool. I
mean, he's not hot at all.

91
00:08:04,192 --> 00:08:06,359
I mean, he's certainly
not my type.

92
00:08:09,572 --> 00:08:11,865
Excuse me, between my
nose and my rack...

93
00:08:11,949 --> 00:08:14,201
which do you think I should
get done first?

94
00:08:14,285 --> 00:08:16,411
Major alcoholic. She's got
problems. Come on.

95
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:18,872
I'm sorry. Wilcox and
Third, please.

96
00:08:18,956 --> 00:08:20,832
Get in. I'll drive you home.

97
00:08:20,917 --> 00:08:23,793
It's okay. Unlike some people
I know, I can walk.

98
00:08:23,878 --> 00:08:25,879
(taxi driver) Are you
getting in or what?

99
00:08:33,387 --> 00:08:34,971
Hey, ma'am, look out!

100
00:08:38,976 --> 00:08:40,519
Hey, check it out.

101
00:09:00,122 --> 00:09:03,542
[man and woman moaning]

102
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:20,892
[woman laughing]
[woman's sharp groan]

103
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:39,369
[man sobbing]
[loud sobbing]

105
00:09:48,838 --> 00:09:59,764
[shouts]

106
00:10:04,395 --> 00:10:05,937
[shouting] No!

107
00:10:08,149 --> 00:10:10,442
[screams]

108
00:10:24,248 --> 00:10:26,958
(Bryce) Anna? Anna!

109
00:10:48,731 --> 00:10:50,899
(Nina) Will she be okay?

110
00:10:51,025 --> 00:10:54,235
(Bryce) Somebody tell me. They ran
all the tests again this morning.

111
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:59,491
[mixed voices]

112
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:05,830
(Francine) Look, she's waking up.
Anna?

113
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:09,167
Anna, can you hear me?

114
00:11:11,629 --> 00:11:15,215
- Hey, chica, we're here.
- Are you okay?

115
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:27,602
Who are you?
Anna, it's me. It's Bryce.

116
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:33,191
[groans] Oh, my head.
You're fine.

117
00:11:33,275 --> 00:11:35,110
My head hurts.

118
00:11:35,194 --> 00:11:38,571
Nothing is broken. You are
a blue-eyed miracle, kid.

119
00:11:38,656 --> 00:11:41,825
Don't. Don't touch me.

120
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:46,037
Who are you?
It's us, chica.

121
00:11:46,122 --> 00:11:48,915
Hey, don't you recognize us?

122
00:11:52,253 --> 00:11:55,130
Anna? You've been unconscious
for over a week.

123
00:11:55,200 --> 00:12:00,135
Doctor. He's not Bryce.
It's okay, Anna. Calm down.

124
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:03,346
I's not him. It's not
Bryce. I know Bryce.

125
00:12:03,431 --> 00:12:05,849
Anna, you just need to relax.
You need some rest.

126
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:09,811
You got a nasty bump on your head.
It's all right, Anna.

127
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:14,232
Please, l-l don't need that.
Anna!

128
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:18,611
Don't touch me.
Don't touch me!

129
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:23,408
Anna! Anna, wait.
She's confused.

130
00:12:29,498 --> 00:12:31,332
[muffled] Do you think she's okay?

131
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:34,294
It's okay.

132
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:42,343
(Bryce) Anna, sweetheart.
(doctor) Open the door.

133
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:47,432
Anna, it's me.
Okay. Okay.

134
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:51,519
Sh, sh.
[panting]

135
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:06,451
[muffled sob]

136
00:13:07,953 --> 00:13:10,079
Take a close look at this, please.

137
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:25,053
And this one?
Is that the same face you see?

138
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:31,559
No.
Both photos are of the same man.

139
00:13:35,189 --> 00:13:38,650
What you are experiencing are
symptoms of prosopagnosia.

140
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:43,154
Sorry, proso-what?
Prosopagnosia or face blindness.

141
00:13:43,239 --> 00:13:45,740
It-it's an impairment in
face perception...

142
00:13:45,825 --> 00:13:48,159
caused by a lesion on
the temporal lobe.

143
00:13:48,285 --> 00:13:51,329
It's this part of the brain that
allows us in a nanosecond...

144
00:13:51,455 --> 00:13:54,916
to compare someone's face with all
of the faces stored in our memory.

145
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,918
You wanna dumb it down
a little bit, Doc?

146
00:13:57,002 --> 00:13:59,128
Every time you look at
someone's face...

147
00:13:59,255 --> 00:14:03,258
it's as if you've never seen them
before. Even someone close to you.

148
00:14:04,927 --> 00:14:06,970
Even your own reflection.

149
00:14:07,096 --> 00:14:11,349
However, confirmed cases of
prosopagnosia are extremely rare.

150
00:14:11,433 --> 00:14:15,478
Anna is probably suffering
a slight cerebral shock.

151
00:14:15,604 --> 00:14:19,524
If the symptoms persist, you'll need
to see another specialist...

152
00:14:19,608 --> 00:14:21,693
for a second opinion.

153
00:14:26,198 --> 00:14:28,032
Twenty-dollar words for stuff...

154
00:14:28,117 --> 00:14:31,369
they know nothing about.
Psychiatrists for ya.

155
00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:40,795
I had the place cleaned
for when you came back.

156
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,964
Thank you.

157
00:14:48,178 --> 00:14:51,222
You know, I really thought I
was gonna lose you there.

158
00:14:52,308 --> 00:14:53,558
Come here.

159
00:14:58,063 --> 00:15:02,275
So, are you getting used
to my new looks?

160
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:08,281
Are they an improvement at least?
Yeah, I mean... no.

161
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:15,330
Y-you look great.
You see? It's not all bad.

162
00:15:15,414 --> 00:15:17,248
It'll pass.

163
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:20,209
And everything will go back
to the way that it was.

164
00:15:20,294 --> 00:15:24,422
Hey, at least some things
never change.

165
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:28,593
[phone rings]
Oh, that'll be your dad.

166
00:15:28,719 --> 00:15:32,972
He's been calling non-stop on some
crackly line from Argentina.

167
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:37,185
[ringing]
Hello. Uh, no.

168
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:41,856
I just brought her home.
No, I understand but--

169
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:46,986
If you want.
Okay, I'll bring her in.

170
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:53,493
All right.
Hey.

171
00:15:53,577 --> 00:15:55,828
Everything okay?

172
00:15:57,790 --> 00:15:59,290
Yeah.

173
00:16:00,709 --> 00:16:02,835
Who was that?

174
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:06,381
It was just the police. Some detective.
He keeps calling.

175
00:16:06,465 --> 00:16:09,217
He wants to take your
statement. Now.

176
00:16:17,142 --> 00:16:20,019
Guess you put a pretty
good fight, huh?

177
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:27,443
How do you know that?
I called your cell.

178
00:16:27,528 --> 00:16:31,280
On the bridge, remember?
I heard things.

179
00:16:31,365 --> 00:16:34,575
I'm the one who called the police.

180
00:16:36,787 --> 00:16:39,330
[sighs]

181
00:16:44,795 --> 00:16:47,880
(detective) Any more internal memos
end up in the Tribune...

182
00:16:47,965 --> 00:16:50,425
I'll personally tear the son
of a bitch a new ass hole.

183
00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:53,094
M iss Marchant, correct?
How's the head?

184
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:56,014
You're the boyfriend?
Yeah. Bryce.

185
00:16:56,098 --> 00:16:57,765
I'm Kerrest. This way.

186
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:02,812
Watch your step.
Oh, I'm so sorry.

187
00:17:02,896 --> 00:17:06,315
Oh, don't go in. Just sign this
before you do anything.

188
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,526
Oh, you're wearing that
pretty blue tie.

189
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:11,863
Thank you.
[cell phone siren ringtone]

190
00:17:11,947 --> 00:17:13,990
Would you change this goddamn
cell phone ring?

191
00:17:14,074 --> 00:17:17,702
Why don't you just figure it out
yourself, you freaking loser.

192
00:17:17,786 --> 00:17:21,247
A pasta bracelet. It's all
we found on the bridge.

193
00:17:21,331 --> 00:17:26,335
No bag, no phone. Are you sure
they didn't fall with you?

194
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:28,921
I'm gonna ask you not to cancel
your cell phone contract.

195
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:32,133
The asshole's probably not stupid
enough to use it, but you never know.

196
00:17:32,217 --> 00:17:34,385
So you really think that it's him?

197
00:17:34,511 --> 00:17:37,560
He killed, raped, and wept
over the corpse. You

198
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:39,057
must know how he works.

199
00:17:39,141 --> 00:17:41,392
He's been front page news
for six months now.

200
00:17:41,477 --> 00:17:43,686
They even have a snappy
name for him.

201
00:17:43,771 --> 00:17:45,938
Tearjerk Jack.

202
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:53,488
So, are you gonna protect her?
This, my friend...

203
00:17:53,614 --> 00:17:56,908
is what we have to wade through just
to request police protection.

204
00:17:56,992 --> 00:18:00,161
Twenty of these get dumped on the
Chief's desk every morning.

205
00:18:02,122 --> 00:18:05,041
Cops parked outside your house
24/7 scarfing doughnuts.

206
00:18:05,125 --> 00:18:07,668
Strictly 911 territory.

207
00:18:07,753 --> 00:18:11,923
He's got my papers. He's
got my address.

208
00:18:12,049 --> 00:18:14,680
And he's not stupid enough to
go after the one person who

209
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:15,927
can recognize him, right?

210
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:24,727
Look... [clears throat]

211
00:18:24,812 --> 00:18:28,940
I'm sorry you had to meet
this year's whackjob.

212
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:39,158
You wanna feel safe?
Help me catch the son of a bitch.

213
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:44,747
What do you got for me here?

214
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:48,459
Thirty-five, forty, tall, dark?

215
00:18:48,544 --> 00:18:51,671
I'm not letting you out of here until
you give me more than this.

216
00:18:51,755 --> 00:18:58,928
Did you or did you
not see his face?

217
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,223
Yes, I did.
Good. We're getting somewhere.

218
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:09,438
Here. Look these over carefully.
Take your time.

219
00:19:09,565 --> 00:19:12,680
This is bullshit! Miss Marchant,
you haven't even

220
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:14,277
looked at half of these.

221
00:19:14,361 --> 00:19:17,238
I can't remember his face,
okay? Since the accident--

222
00:19:17,322 --> 00:19:19,115
Anna, just--sh.

223
00:19:19,199 --> 00:19:21,617
She just got out of the hospital
. She needs rest.

224
00:19:21,743 --> 00:19:24,920
Rest? You go tell that to
the six women whose throat

225
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:26,372
he cut from ear to ear!

226
00:19:26,456 --> 00:19:28,583
I apologize if I'm rattling
your cage...

227
00:19:28,667 --> 00:19:33,212
but I'd rather the next time we meet
you weren't lying on a slab.

228
00:19:33,297 --> 00:19:37,216
I can't recognize faces anymore.
Do you understand?

229
00:19:45,517 --> 00:19:47,351
Since the accident I--

230
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:54,942
That-that man could be right in front
of me and I wouldn't know it.

231
00:19:55,027 --> 00:19:57,862
Please, don't waste your time
trying to scare me...

232
00:19:57,946 --> 00:20:00,781
because I am. I already am.

233
00:20:05,037 --> 00:20:07,622
Call the hospital.
They'll explain.

234
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:12,501
(man) Hey, Nicky.

235
00:20:22,054 --> 00:20:24,972
Lanyon, I've been trying to reach
you for the last two hours.

236
00:20:25,057 --> 00:20:27,767
Man, it's Wednesday.
Nicholas. No cell.

237
00:20:27,851 --> 00:20:30,394
Guess who just woke
up and walked in?

238
00:20:30,479 --> 00:20:31,896
Anna Marchant.

239
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:35,274
Dammit, not a diet Pepsi.

240
00:20:37,486 --> 00:20:40,488
So, what's the story?
You got any leads?

241
00:20:40,572 --> 00:20:42,573
Can we talk?

242
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:49,080
So, this face blindness...
is it temporary or permanent?

243
00:20:50,457 --> 00:20:52,083
They have no freaking idea.

244
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:58,339
[chuckles]
You think it's funny?

245
00:20:58,423 --> 00:21:01,160
Well, she's the only one
who's seen him, and she can't

246
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,093
recognize anybody?

247
00:21:02,177 --> 00:21:04,845
You gotta admit it's
pretty far out.

248
00:21:10,769 --> 00:21:12,561
How's the kid doing?

249
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:17,191
He still hasn't uttered a word.

250
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:24,323
We have no lead, no I D. Jorgensen
in forensics...

251
00:21:24,408 --> 00:21:26,701
even pushed a trace on
the tear sample...

252
00:21:26,785 --> 00:21:29,370
through the Feds' DNA
database. Nada.

253
00:21:29,454 --> 00:21:32,039
The guy is a freaking ghost.

254
00:21:32,124 --> 00:21:35,668
You're the mind reader with
the fancy diploma.

255
00:21:35,752 --> 00:21:37,920
You know what I think?

256
00:21:38,005 --> 00:21:40,320
The guy has to kill women
to be able to touch them

257
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:43,217
. Well, that's sad.
The melancholy killer theory?

258
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:47,013
I mean, come on. You gotta
give me more than that.

259
00:21:47,097 --> 00:21:51,642
He weeps because his sexual compulsions
disgust him. He--

260
00:21:51,727 --> 00:21:54,520
he only kills so they won't
see him as he truly is.

261
00:21:58,275 --> 00:22:01,277
Anna Marchant saw him.

262
00:22:04,156 --> 00:22:06,440
Yeah, and she-she survived
. I think he's gonna be

263
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:07,616
really interested in her.

264
00:22:07,743 --> 00:22:10,080
Let me head down the Mission
. Have another crack at that

265
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:11,120
hobo who fished her out.

266
00:22:11,204 --> 00:22:14,332
Good luck. We got nothing out
of him but sea shanties.

267
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:25,259
[gasps]

268
00:22:31,558 --> 00:22:33,225
[water running]

269
00:22:34,978 --> 00:22:36,645
[sighs]

270
00:22:46,531 --> 00:22:47,782
[muffled shriek]

271
00:22:50,744 --> 00:22:53,454
[birds chirping]

272
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:04,799
Hey, there.
Have we met somewhere before?

273
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:09,261
[gasps]
[softly] Hey.

274
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:14,433
[whispers] I'm sorry.
It was just a bad dream.

275
00:23:14,518 --> 00:23:16,519
Hey, it's okay.

276
00:23:19,523 --> 00:23:22,191
Look, they need me at the
office this morning but--

277
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:26,987
Now, if you want, I can--
No, it's okay. I'm--

278
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:30,408
I'm fine.
Are you sure?

279
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:53,639
Hey.
You gave me quite a ride, old boy.

280
00:23:53,723 --> 00:23:55,850
Why weren't you down
at the Mission?

281
00:23:55,934 --> 00:23:58,436
It's dirty there.

282
00:24:00,689 --> 00:24:03,065
Might not be the Savoy
but at least it's safe.

283
00:24:03,150 --> 00:24:05,860
Anything could happen
to you down here.

284
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:10,531
And what do you care, huh?
[laughs]

285
00:24:13,493 --> 00:24:17,913
I got some questions and this time
I really need the answers.

286
00:24:18,039 --> 00:24:20,560
(Anna's father) The soonest I
can get out is on Tuesday's

287
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:21,792
red eye from Buenos Aires.

288
00:24:21,877 --> 00:24:24,545
Look, I'll take you to dinner.
I'll spoil you rotten.

289
00:24:24,629 --> 00:24:26,714
Well, that sounds great.
You know what?

290
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:29,467
Why don't you come meet me at school?
I start back on Wednesday.

291
00:24:29,551 --> 00:24:31,594
Okay, any delays I'll call you.

292
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:34,430
Can you call me on Bryce's Blackberry?
Do you have that number?

293
00:24:34,514 --> 00:24:36,140
I have it, I have it.
Now listen...

294
00:24:36,224 --> 00:24:38,184
I wish I could've been
there for you.

295
00:24:38,268 --> 00:24:40,394
It's okay, Dad. I love you
, okay? I'll see you then.

296
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:43,647
I love you, too, Snowflake. Bye.
Bye.

297
00:24:54,826 --> 00:24:57,745
[calling]

298
00:24:59,664 --> 00:25:02,249
[doorbell]

299
00:25:11,009 --> 00:25:12,635
Hello.

300
00:25:14,679 --> 00:25:17,681
It's us, chica. Open up!

301
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:23,896
Hi, Sleeping Beauty.
Know who we are this time?

302
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:26,148
Oh, yeah. I mean, absolutely.

303
00:25:26,233 --> 00:25:29,693
I was just really zoned
out last time.

304
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:33,864
I mean, I'm--
really fine.

305
00:25:33,949 --> 00:25:37,535
Well, look. You made
the front page.

306
00:25:37,619 --> 00:25:39,537
You're famous, bebe.

307
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:49,588
God, I got away.
[reads murmuring]

308
00:25:49,673 --> 00:25:51,632
Oh, my God.

309
00:25:51,758 --> 00:25:55,302
I n heaven there's no beer. Let's
drink it all right here.

310
00:25:55,428 --> 00:26:00,099
I n heaven there's no beer. Let's
drink it all right here!

311
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:05,312
Look who's back. Hello, handsome.
You feel like remembering?

312
00:26:05,397 --> 00:26:07,815
There's a two-six in
it for ya. Right?

313
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:16,323
Oh. I'll call you.
Or I'll text you.

314
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:23,289
[laughing]
[chuckling]

315
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:28,002
Martinis at 11 a. m.
It's almost midnight in Shanghai.

316
00:26:28,086 --> 00:26:29,837
Just drink up.

317
00:26:29,921 --> 00:26:32,381
[gasps] Nina, you did not
just post that pic.

318
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:36,010
I look squinty. No, no, deleto.
I don't think so!

319
00:26:36,094 --> 00:26:38,012
Por favor.

320
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:59,950
[whispering] I'll be right back.
Okay, chica.

321
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:22,556
[singing] Hello.
Hey.

322
00:27:22,641 --> 00:27:24,516
What do you want now?

323
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:44,870
[clears throat]
Do you see anything?

324
00:27:46,915 --> 00:27:49,500
[British accent] No.

325
00:27:49,584 --> 00:27:54,588
Just reminds me of Europe After
the Rain by Max Ernst.

326
00:27:54,673 --> 00:27:56,256
I'm sorry?

327
00:27:56,341 --> 00:28:00,636
So, what was I supposed
to see exactly?

328
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:04,223
Well, l-l-l guess if I really
have, uh, proso--

329
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:06,934
Prosopagnosia.
Yes.

330
00:28:07,018 --> 00:28:08,602
Well, you tell me.

331
00:28:08,687 --> 00:28:12,231
Can you or can you not
see people's faces?

332
00:28:14,609 --> 00:28:16,652
Well, of course I can
see people's faces.

333
00:28:16,736 --> 00:28:20,823
It's just that they keep
changing all the time.

334
00:28:20,907 --> 00:28:24,034
So, you have the answer
to your question.

335
00:28:25,787 --> 00:28:27,871
Cinnamon candy?

336
00:28:30,041 --> 00:28:34,628
But there must be some sort of
treatment. Medication or--

337
00:28:34,713 --> 00:28:36,797
[laughs]

338
00:28:36,881 --> 00:28:41,468
Face blindness isn't something you
just catch, M iss Marchant.

339
00:28:41,553 --> 00:28:43,721
It's something you lose.

340
00:28:45,098 --> 00:28:47,015
What are you telling me?

341
00:28:48,727 --> 00:28:51,061
That I'm gonna be stuck
like this forever?

342
00:28:53,148 --> 00:28:58,485
You're gonna have to get used to
people's faces changing...

343
00:28:58,560 --> 00:29:03,824
as soon as you lose sight of them.
Out of a thousand faces...

344
00:29:03,908 --> 00:29:07,995
one might miraculously linger.

345
00:29:11,458 --> 00:29:13,667
Thank you so much.

346
00:29:15,170 --> 00:29:17,838
Doctor.

347
00:29:17,922 --> 00:29:20,966
Faces are the bar code
of the human race.

348
00:29:21,050 --> 00:29:23,761
Ever since mankind
went tribal...

349
00:29:23,845 --> 00:29:26,513
we're constantly looking at
each other's faces...

350
00:29:26,598 --> 00:29:30,851
trying to decide whether they're
friends, foes or lovers.

351
00:29:30,935 --> 00:29:35,147
Don't underestimate the seriousness
of your condition, M iss Marchant.

352
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:47,993
[alarm clock beeping]
[beeping]

353
00:29:49,871 --> 00:29:51,622
[beeping stops]

354
00:29:53,541 --> 00:29:55,918
I don't wanna be late for school.

355
00:30:12,477 --> 00:30:15,896
Okay, everybody. Um, can l-can
I get some quiet, please?

356
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:23,362
Great.
Um--

357
00:30:23,446 --> 00:30:27,783
so today, uh, we are going
to play a new type of game.

358
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:32,746
Okay?
And we get to wear stickers!

359
00:30:32,831 --> 00:30:36,083
And it's gonna be superfun.

360
00:30:37,126 --> 00:30:38,669
Fun, fun, fun.

361
00:30:40,213 --> 00:30:42,172
So when I call your name...

362
00:30:42,257 --> 00:30:44,675
I want you to come up to
my desk one by one...

363
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:52,975
starting with Caroline Beasley.
Now, for this game to work...

364
00:30:53,059 --> 00:30:55,769
I need you to wear the sticker
all day long...

365
00:30:55,854 --> 00:30:57,938
and don't take it off.
Do you understand?

366
00:30:58,022 --> 00:31:00,107
Yes, M iss Marchant.

367
00:31:00,233 --> 00:31:03,652
Does everybody understand? Please,
keep your stickers on all day.

368
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:10,409
Charlotte Canton.
[children shouting]

369
00:31:10,493 --> 00:31:12,703
Stop. You guys, settle
down. Please.

370
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:16,039
Caroline.
I didn't do anything!

371
00:31:16,165 --> 00:31:18,458
I need you to turn around I
need to see your stickers.

372
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:21,920
Hi. I'm here for my daughter.
Your daughter. Uh--

373
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:26,466
Sandra.
Sandra. Sandra. Uh, Sandra.

374
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:31,513
Uh--
Miss, Miss. Miss, I need to go pee.

375
00:31:31,598 --> 00:31:33,682
Okay, sweetie, go pee.

376
00:31:38,104 --> 00:31:40,772
I'm sorry, I'm in a bit of a
rush. Where's my daughter?

377
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:46,737
Sorry. Uh, Sandra. Sandra?
Miss, Sandra left with her daddy.

378
00:31:46,821 --> 00:31:48,614
Left with her dad.

379
00:31:48,698 --> 00:31:51,158
You let her go with my ex-husband?
Are you insane?

380
00:31:51,242 --> 00:31:54,161
I told you not to let her
go with my ex-husband!

381
00:31:54,245 --> 00:31:57,664
I have full custody! What
time did they go?

382
00:31:57,749 --> 00:32:00,709
Was he with somebody? I need to
know if he was with somebody.

383
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:06,214
That is really, really important.
[children making noise]

384
00:32:06,299 --> 00:32:09,176
[noise increases]

385
00:32:12,221 --> 00:32:14,264
Shut up!

386
00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:19,978
[school bell rings]

387
00:32:20,063 --> 00:32:22,648
I have trouble concentrating
on names, that's all.

388
00:32:22,732 --> 00:32:25,776
But it will pass. I mean
, it will pass.

389
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:27,945
I n the meantime...

390
00:32:28,029 --> 00:32:30,572
how are you gonna watch the
children in the yard?

391
00:32:30,657 --> 00:32:33,951
Or during swimming classes?
With your stickers?

392
00:32:35,578 --> 00:32:38,121
[sighs] Anna, you're
my best teacher.

393
00:32:44,253 --> 00:32:46,672
But I'm gonna have to suspend
you. I'm sorry.

394
00:32:46,756 --> 00:32:50,801
If you're better by September,
I'll see what I can do.

395
00:33:27,255 --> 00:33:29,131
"Be wary of appearances...

396
00:33:29,215 --> 00:33:31,508
and an unexpected invitation
to dinner."

397
00:33:59,954 --> 00:34:03,165
[sirens wailing]

398
00:34:13,301 --> 00:34:16,136
Carotid artery and the larynx are
severed, just like the others.

399
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:19,931
Looks like a match.
Missed him by minutes.

400
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:25,062
[cell phone ringing]
Kerrest.

401
00:34:25,146 --> 00:34:28,315
He's here. He's here
with me right now.

402
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:30,817
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa. What's going on?

403
00:34:30,902 --> 00:34:33,195
I'm on the subway. And
the bag I lost...

404
00:34:33,279 --> 00:34:35,322
he put it right on the
seat in front of me.

405
00:34:35,406 --> 00:34:37,741
Hold on. You saw him?

406
00:34:37,825 --> 00:34:41,453
No, but there-there was somebody
watching me outside the school.

407
00:34:41,537 --> 00:34:43,663
Maybe he followed me
into the train.

408
00:34:43,720 --> 00:34:47,834
The bag, you sure it's yours?
Of course I'm sure.

409
00:34:47,919 --> 00:34:50,587
I might not know people's faces,
but I know my own damn handbag.

410
00:34:50,671 --> 00:34:54,174
All right. So, the guy you
saw, what's he look like?

411
00:34:54,258 --> 00:34:56,676
How the hell should I know?

412
00:34:56,761 --> 00:34:59,054
It could be any goddamn
one of them.

413
00:34:59,138 --> 00:35:00,972
You gotta help me out
here, all right?

414
00:35:01,057 --> 00:35:03,517
I can't shut down a whole subway
just for a handbag.

415
00:35:03,601 --> 00:35:05,769
[nervous voice] Um, okay.

416
00:35:05,853 --> 00:35:08,688
He was wearing an orange shirt,
a bright orange shirt.

417
00:35:08,773 --> 00:35:12,109
Orange shirt. Thank you.
Where are you exactly?

418
00:35:13,694 --> 00:35:15,862
Line four, going to Harlin Street.

419
00:35:15,947 --> 00:35:18,907
You need to listen to me. Whatever
you do, you stay on that train.

420
00:35:18,991 --> 00:35:21,868
Make sure that people are
around you. I'm gonna--

421
00:35:21,953 --> 00:35:23,370
Hello?

422
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:27,457
[whispers] Hello?
[phone off the hook]

423
00:35:27,542 --> 00:35:29,918
Damn.

424
00:35:30,002 --> 00:35:33,255
[woman over P.A.] Those connecting
to line two, this is your exit.

425
00:36:27,852 --> 00:36:29,686
Make sure where you go.

426
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:00,884
No!

427
00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:05,472
[alarm goes off]

428
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:14,022
You stay away from me. Stay away!
What's going on?

429
00:37:14,106 --> 00:37:16,024
Don't move, buddy. Stay
where you are.

430
00:37:16,108 --> 00:37:17,817
What the hell is going on here?

431
00:37:17,902 --> 00:37:20,111
Anna, you told me to
meet you after work.

432
00:37:20,238 --> 00:37:23,531
I see you running down into the subway.
What the hell is going on here?

433
00:37:23,616 --> 00:37:25,784
Just stand still, sir.

434
00:37:25,868 --> 00:37:30,330
For God's sake, Snowflake. Why
are you so scared of me?

435
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:34,417
Daddy?
Let go.

436
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:39,089
Oh, Daddy.
[sobbing] I'm so sorry.

437
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:43,176
Oh, Daddy.
Sweetie, it's all right.

438
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:49,307
It's all right. I'm okay.
[phone ringing]

439
00:37:49,433 --> 00:37:54,104
Hey, it's Anna and Bryce. We're not
home. Please leave a message. Bye.

440
00:37:54,188 --> 00:37:56,606
Hi, Snowflake. Look, I'm
back at the airport.

441
00:37:56,691 --> 00:37:58,525
Listen to me.

442
00:37:58,609 --> 00:38:01,861
You have to tell Bryce
about your condition.

443
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:06,616
You can't just ignore it.
[beep]

444
00:38:26,929 --> 00:38:28,638
[sniffles]

445
00:38:36,897 --> 00:38:38,690
[whining]

446
00:38:46,282 --> 00:38:48,950
[crying]

447
00:38:53,789 --> 00:38:55,665
[shouts]

448
00:39:02,214 --> 00:39:04,215
[doorbell chimes]

449
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:10,638
Hi.
M iss Marchant! Hello!

450
00:39:10,723 --> 00:39:14,017
I just wanted to tell
you. Oh, God.

451
00:39:15,353 --> 00:39:16,811
Everything you said...

452
00:39:18,522 --> 00:39:20,273
you were right.

453
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:28,114
When I was 16...
I had two passions in life.

454
00:39:28,199 --> 00:39:31,951
Horse-back riding and opera.

455
00:39:33,454 --> 00:39:37,499
I dreamt of being the next Callas.

456
00:39:37,583 --> 00:39:40,877
Until the horse threw me head-first
into a brick wall.

457
00:39:40,961 --> 00:39:43,129
The accident left me deaf...

458
00:39:43,214 --> 00:39:46,049
and I had to rule out
an operatic career.

459
00:39:46,133 --> 00:39:48,343
You're deaf?

460
00:39:48,469 --> 00:39:51,120
Oh, yes, as a post. I have
to read your lips to know

461
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:52,222
what you're saying.

462
00:39:53,724 --> 00:39:57,644
But I can still hear Wagner.

463
00:39:57,728 --> 00:40:01,147
I just have to close
my eyes and listen.

464
00:40:02,983 --> 00:40:06,486
And you too are going to
have to learn...

465
00:40:06,570 --> 00:40:09,072
to find your inner music.

466
00:40:09,156 --> 00:40:12,867
Everyone always goes on about
sight, hearing, smell.

467
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:16,704
But there's another sense.
A hidden one.

468
00:40:16,789 --> 00:40:19,916
The Japanese call it "muga."

469
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:23,044
It's the sense that allows
you to walk...

470
00:40:23,129 --> 00:40:26,673
without having to think about putting
one foot in front of the other.

471
00:40:26,757 --> 00:40:29,384
You lose this sense...

472
00:40:29,468 --> 00:40:32,971
and you will become like some
of my other patients.

473
00:40:33,055 --> 00:40:35,014
Socially paralyzed...

474
00:40:35,099 --> 00:40:39,769
withdrawing from the world into
the safety of isolation.

475
00:40:39,854 --> 00:40:42,772
That's a tempting option.

476
00:40:42,857 --> 00:40:46,693
[whispering] No, I don't want
that. I wanna live normally.

477
00:40:46,777 --> 00:40:49,028
Every day people are going
to resent you...

478
00:40:49,113 --> 00:40:51,656
for not recognizing who they are.

479
00:40:51,740 --> 00:40:56,536
They'll call you rude, forgetful
, stupid, liar.

480
00:40:56,620 --> 00:40:58,455
Now, are you willing
to fight back...

481
00:40:58,520 --> 00:41:03,042
with all your might?
Yeah.

482
00:41:03,127 --> 00:41:06,796
To try and try again without losing
heart, without giving an inch?

483
00:41:06,881 --> 00:41:08,673
Yes.

484
00:41:10,342 --> 00:41:11,676
Good.

485
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:18,975
Then let's get to work.
Allow me to introduce you...

486
00:41:21,020 --> 00:41:24,147
to Mike...

487
00:41:25,107 --> 00:41:27,066
and Maggie.

488
00:41:27,151 --> 00:41:29,569
Hard to tell apart at first
sight, aren't they?

489
00:41:29,653 --> 00:41:31,321
Take a closer look.

490
00:41:31,405 --> 00:41:34,908
Maggie is a little paler,
don't you think?

491
00:41:34,992 --> 00:41:38,536
Oh, and look. She
had this scar...

492
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:42,499
on her forehead.
You see?

493
00:41:47,796 --> 00:41:50,400
It gets more complicated when
you have to pick M ike and

494
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:54,427
Maggie out at a party...
among all the other guests.

495
00:41:54,512 --> 00:41:56,596
Yeah.

496
00:41:56,680 --> 00:42:00,183
You're going to learn to focus on
distinctive markers in people.

497
00:42:00,267 --> 00:42:04,646
A mole, a tattoo, their gait.

498
00:42:04,730 --> 00:42:08,024
Anything that stands out that makes
it easier to identify that person.

499
00:42:08,108 --> 00:42:10,109
Right.

500
00:42:10,194 --> 00:42:13,112
What's the first thing you look
at in a man, after his face?

501
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:18,368
My friends and I look at his butt.
[chuckles]

502
00:42:18,452 --> 00:42:20,703
Well, what else is
there to look at?

503
00:42:21,997 --> 00:42:23,540
Right.

504
00:42:27,503 --> 00:42:31,214
Paler in complexion, small
scar on the forehead.

505
00:42:45,813 --> 00:42:47,772
That's Maggie.

506
00:42:56,031 --> 00:42:58,324
Congratulations.

507
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:16,676
â« A thousand faces â«
â« Looking in All directions â«

508

â« Leading me To something â«
â« I can never see â«

509
00:43:23,080 --> 00:43:29,188
â« Why do you think I come here â«
â« Why do you think I come round â«

510
00:43:29,240 --> 00:43:33,526
Hi!
[screeching] Hi.

511
00:43:33,611 --> 00:43:37,196
So, what's this earth-shattering
thing you have to tell us?

512
00:43:37,281 --> 00:43:40,658
[sighs]

513
00:43:40,784 --> 00:43:44,996
The reservation's for seven. Do
you want me to come pick you up?

514
00:43:45,080 --> 00:43:47,457
No, I think I'll meet you there.

515
00:43:51,086 --> 00:43:52,629
Okay.

516
00:43:54,280 --> 00:43:57,634
I'll see you later then.
Bye.

517
00:44:33,504 --> 00:44:37,340
[cell phones ring]

518
00:44:52,106 --> 00:44:56,526
Hey.

519
00:44:58,237 --> 00:45:01,072
Wait. You--

520
00:45:01,156 --> 00:45:05,451
You recognized me! Holy crap, can we
call off the straightjacket now?

521
00:45:05,536 --> 00:45:07,745
Oh, thank God.

522
00:45:07,830 --> 00:45:10,480
I couldn't take another wacko
freak-out every time

523
00:45:10,520 --> 00:45:11,666
I tried to kiss you.

524
00:45:14,378 --> 00:45:17,046
So, this--this doesn't
change anymore, right?

525
00:45:17,131 --> 00:45:19,465
You can-you can really
recognize me?

526
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:25,430
Yes, I do.
[laughs]

527
00:45:25,480 --> 00:45:28,975
What are you talking about?
You don't recognize me?

528
00:45:29,059 --> 00:45:30,643
I'm your best friend.

529
00:45:32,187 --> 00:45:34,731
I do. With your unique
hair cut...

530
00:45:34,815 --> 00:45:38,192
and the red skirt you always wear
when you're trying to get some.

531
00:45:38,277 --> 00:45:42,363
It's fine. But, oh, God, I just--

532
00:45:42,489 --> 00:45:45,160
When-when-when people are
wearing the same clothes

533
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:49,537
or uniforms, forget it.
They all have the same face to me.

534
00:45:49,621 --> 00:45:53,666
What about Bryce? How
is he taking this?

535
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:56,335
[whispers] Oh, God.

536
00:45:57,720 --> 00:46:01,841
He thinks that I'm adjusting.
I told him that I recognized him.

537
00:46:01,925 --> 00:46:03,926
Please, promise me you
won't tell him.

538
00:46:04,011 --> 00:46:06,888
You're lying to him?

539
00:46:06,972 --> 00:46:11,476
I cannot lose him.
Do you understand?

540
00:46:11,560 --> 00:46:13,728
He's the only thing I have left.

541
00:46:33,248 --> 00:46:35,249
(Nina) Hold it right there.

542
00:46:35,334 --> 00:46:38,503
You mean you get to bang a
new guy every night...

543
00:46:38,587 --> 00:46:41,339
without ever cheating
on your boyfriend?

544
00:46:41,423 --> 00:46:43,508
That's like a dream come true.

545
00:46:59,080 --> 00:47:04,570
[laughing]
Another drink.

546
00:47:16,291 --> 00:47:19,627
Take one step. Immerse
yourself...

547
00:47:19,711 --> 00:47:22,922
in people's gestures,
their mannerisms.

548
00:47:31,765 --> 00:47:37,019
Watch them until their bodies
become a melody.

549
00:47:37,104 --> 00:47:42,024
Hum it, hum it, until you can sing
it at the top of your voice.

550
00:47:42,109 --> 00:47:44,277
Use all your resilience, Anna...

551
00:47:44,361 --> 00:47:47,905
but whatever happens, don't
let the music stop.

552
00:48:19,120 --> 00:48:24,358
(man) Hiya.
Oh. Hey. How's it going?

553
00:48:24,440 --> 00:48:28,070
Good.
Didn't expect to see you here.

554
00:48:29,448 --> 00:48:31,824
Well... it's nice to see you.

555
00:48:31,909 --> 00:48:34,368
I'm sorry, I don't remember
your name.

556
00:48:34,440 --> 00:48:38,164
Hm.
That's odd.

557
00:48:38,248 --> 00:48:40,416
I, uh...

558
00:48:42,127 --> 00:48:44,921
usually leave a strong
impression on women.

559
00:48:47,480 --> 00:48:51,177
Okay. Well, see you later.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

560
00:48:51,261 --> 00:48:53,220
What's the rush, huh?

561
00:48:53,305 --> 00:48:56,057
Things are just getting
interesting.

562
00:48:56,141 --> 00:48:59,393
(clerk) Hello. Can I help
you with anything?

563
00:48:59,478 --> 00:49:01,103
Come on, make an effort.

564
00:49:02,439 --> 00:49:04,774
You know who I am.

565
00:49:09,821 --> 00:49:12,531
Officer. Officer, that
man over there.

566
00:49:12,616 --> 00:49:15,159
He's standing right next
to the newsstand.

567
00:49:15,240 --> 00:49:19,497
What are you saying?
That man over--

568
00:49:25,295 --> 00:49:26,504
Never mind.

569
00:49:28,465 --> 00:49:30,091
I am not letting--

570
00:49:30,175 --> 00:49:32,635
Excuse me. Detective
Kerrest, please.

571
00:49:32,680 --> 00:49:36,138
Hold on.
I'm gonna check if he's here.

572
00:49:42,270 --> 00:49:43,479
Hey.

573
00:49:46,316 --> 00:49:49,944
Seen any more killers
on public transport?

574
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:53,030
Just don't move.
What are you doing?

575
00:49:53,115 --> 00:49:55,491
I need to check something.
Can you stay there? Please.

576
00:49:55,575 --> 00:49:57,368
I won't move.

577
00:50:07,045 --> 00:50:09,213
Oh, my God!

578
00:50:09,297 --> 00:50:12,800
I recognize your face. I recognize
your face. It's still your face.

579
00:50:12,884 --> 00:50:14,844
Me? You recognize me?

580
00:50:16,471 --> 00:50:19,098
Yes.

581
00:50:19,182 --> 00:50:22,018
It's the first face I recognize
since the incident.

582
00:50:23,480 --> 00:50:27,523
Do you think that means something?
I don't know.

583
00:50:31,361 --> 00:50:33,279
[whispers] I don't know.

584
00:50:39,360 --> 00:50:45,249
Hey. Any word from the DA?
Oh. Am I interrupting something?

585
00:50:45,320 --> 00:50:49,003
No.
Are you okay?

586
00:50:49,087 --> 00:50:51,720
M iss Marchant, allow me
to introduce Eric Lanyon

587
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:53,007
, our star pitcher...

588
00:50:53,091 --> 00:50:55,301
ace profiler and all-round
swell guy.

589
00:50:55,385 --> 00:50:58,763
They say it takes a warped mind to
get into a psychopath's head...

590
00:50:58,840 --> 00:51:03,476
but I'm okay. Really.
Nicky had another nosebleed.

591
00:51:03,520 --> 00:51:06,729
It's nice to meet you.
You, too. What brings you here?

592
00:51:07,856 --> 00:51:09,774
I saw the papers.

593
00:51:09,858 --> 00:51:12,443
I wanna know everything there
is to know about this man.

594
00:51:12,569 --> 00:51:15,362
You're talking to the right guy.
Lanyon knows everything...

595
00:51:15,447 --> 00:51:18,741
about our friendly neighborhood
whackjob.

596
00:51:20,494 --> 00:51:22,995
I betcha can't pinch a
pen from Lydia's desk.

597
00:51:29,544 --> 00:51:32,922
I don't know if he really
tried to kill you.

598
00:51:33,006 --> 00:51:35,800
He has an odd way for asking
about dinner and a movie.

599
00:51:35,884 --> 00:51:39,261
What he's saying is that maybe he
reacted out of self-defense.

600
00:51:39,346 --> 00:51:41,514
Forgive me, M iss Marchant.

601
00:51:41,598 --> 00:51:44,100
If he really wanted to kill you
once you left hospital...

602
00:51:44,184 --> 00:51:46,560
we wouldn't be standing
here talking about it.

603
00:51:46,645 --> 00:51:48,771
I wanna help catch this guy.

604
00:51:52,317 --> 00:51:54,735
No. I'm not gonna--

605
00:51:54,820 --> 00:51:58,114
I'm not gonna recognize his face
like that. I need to see them.

606
00:51:58,160 --> 00:52:03,035
I n front of me.
I guess it's worth a shot.

607
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:05,454
I'd have to run to catch
the D.A. right now.

608
00:52:06,790 --> 00:52:08,415
Very nice to meet you.

609
00:52:11,169 --> 00:52:14,421
So, what's your colleague's theory?

610
00:52:14,506 --> 00:52:17,133
He thinks you made quite an
impression on the freak.

611
00:52:17,217 --> 00:52:19,135
Watched him do his thing
and walked away.

612
00:52:22,139 --> 00:52:24,140
What do you think?

613
00:52:26,768 --> 00:52:30,229
About a year ago when Homicide turned
up the first victim...

614
00:52:30,313 --> 00:52:35,067
Lanyon insisted he had the
hallmark of a sociopath.

615
00:52:35,193 --> 00:52:39,572
We didn't agree. We thought it was
a one off, a crime of passion.

616
00:52:39,656 --> 00:52:42,283
Six months later, another
dead woman showed up.

617
00:52:42,367 --> 00:52:45,327
She had an 8-year-old son who...

618
00:52:45,412 --> 00:52:47,663
found her on the bedroom floor
with her throat cut.

619
00:52:51,626 --> 00:52:53,961
Now he sees the kid every
chance he gets.

620
00:53:00,343 --> 00:53:04,180
I've learned to keep my mouth shut
and trust what Lanyon says.

621
00:53:10,687 --> 00:53:11,937
Sh.

622
00:53:14,399 --> 00:53:17,985
(Lanyon) Come on, you can drop
the freaking Snow White act.

623
00:53:18,040 --> 00:53:21,363
You've all been here before.
Got a light?

624
00:53:21,448 --> 00:53:23,657
There's no smoking here.
Come on, get in.

625
00:53:23,742 --> 00:53:28,329
All right, stand in line
and look straight ahead.

626
00:53:28,413 --> 00:53:30,247
Step it up.

627
00:53:32,542 --> 00:53:35,502
They're all known offenders
that match your statement.

628
00:53:35,587 --> 00:53:38,047
We're waiting on papers to
run DNA checks on 'em.

629
00:53:38,131 --> 00:53:40,382
They're all yours.

630
00:53:42,920 --> 00:53:46,347
How are we doing in here?
Fine.

631
00:53:55,565 --> 00:54:00,819
[whispering] Do you think they could
move around a little bit?

632
00:54:00,946 --> 00:54:03,520
All right, we've seen enough
of your ugly mugs. I want

633
00:54:03,560 --> 00:54:04,531
you to walk around.

634
00:54:04,616 --> 00:54:08,077
Anybody who slacks up gets
a night in a cell.

635
00:54:08,161 --> 00:54:11,080
I just need to see their gestures,
their- their-their movements.

636
00:54:11,164 --> 00:54:13,040
I know it sounds crazy but--

637
00:54:13,124 --> 00:54:15,125
If you want to host a dance
class, it's fine with me.

638
00:54:15,210 --> 00:54:17,586
I said move your asses.
Now, get to it.

639
00:54:29,391 --> 00:54:31,392
[whispering] It's not any of them.

640
00:54:33,186 --> 00:54:34,770
Are you sure?

641
00:54:36,920 --> 00:54:40,651
Yeah.
At least we tried.

642
00:54:43,947 --> 00:54:45,698
I'm really sorry.

643
00:54:46,825 --> 00:54:49,326
l-l wanted to help.

644
00:54:53,790 --> 00:54:55,749
Anna.

645
00:55:06,511 --> 00:55:09,305
Good luck with the investigation.

646
00:55:16,062 --> 00:55:18,397
Sam! Bad news.

647
00:55:18,523 --> 00:55:21,040
M ulgrew won't go for the
witness protection you requested

648
00:55:21,080 --> 00:55:21,900
for Anna Marchant.

649
00:55:21,985 --> 00:55:24,028
After the subway blowout and
the line-up on top...

650
00:55:24,112 --> 00:55:26,447
they don't think she's
100 % compos mentis.

651
00:55:26,531 --> 00:55:28,880
It's absolute bullshit. She's
the only witness we've

652
00:55:28,920 --> 00:55:31,994
got, for God's sake.
We need to up our game here.

653
00:55:32,078 --> 00:55:33,912
Organize another line-up, manana.

654
00:55:33,997 --> 00:55:36,165
Come on. We can't bring in
every perp in the city...

655
00:55:36,249 --> 00:55:39,251
hoping she'll recognize the
inside leg of his trousers!

656
00:55:39,336 --> 00:55:42,838
I guess that'll give you a good
excuse to see her again.

657
00:55:42,922 --> 00:55:44,590
What did you say?

658
00:55:44,674 --> 00:55:47,134
Come on, buddy. You
know what I mean.

659
00:55:50,055 --> 00:55:53,140
One, she has a boyfriend. Two,
there's nothing between us.

660
00:55:53,266 --> 00:55:56,360
Three, even if there was, I swear,
if you mention this to anybody,

661
00:55:56,400 --> 00:55:57,436
I will kick your ass.

662
00:55:57,520 --> 00:56:00,689
It's highly unethical and possibly
illegal for a police officer...

663
00:56:00,760 --> 00:56:06,528
to fraternize with a key witness.
Whoa. It's that bad?

664
00:56:08,448 --> 00:56:09,948
Screw it.

665
00:56:16,414 --> 00:56:19,291
I mean, seriously, can you picture
the two of us together...

666
00:56:19,360 --> 00:56:22,878
arm in arm at the police ball?
Why not?

667
00:56:22,962 --> 00:56:26,090
I always thought you looked rather
fetching in uniform.

668
00:56:30,280 --> 00:56:34,431
Happy birthday, chica.
Thank you.

669
00:56:34,480 --> 00:56:38,977
[laughter]
Quick, quick. Look, look.

670
00:56:39,062 --> 00:56:41,063
A twelve out of ten.
Twelve out of ten.

671
00:56:41,147 --> 00:56:43,565
[excitedly] He's totally
checking me out!

672
00:56:43,650 --> 00:56:46,068
So that's what you do on
your girls' nights out?

673
00:56:46,152 --> 00:56:49,571
Well, no, not me. No,
just-just, um--

674
00:56:49,656 --> 00:56:52,241
(Nina) Everybody's dancing tonight.

675
00:56:53,880 --> 00:56:58,330
Even you, Bryce.
[techno music]

676
00:57:00,917 --> 00:57:02,960
[laughing]

677
00:57:05,480 --> 00:57:08,424
I'm gonna go get us a drink.
Okay.

678
00:57:08,480 --> 00:57:12,594
Did you see that? Totally on me.
Where is he?

679
00:57:12,640 --> 00:57:17,433
Okay, okay, back up.
Give her a chance.

680
00:57:17,480 --> 00:57:20,352
Okay, what do I do?
Just act natural, okay?

681
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:23,897
Natural?
Okay? Go, go, go.

682
00:57:23,982 --> 00:57:25,190
Okay.

683
00:57:58,766 --> 00:58:00,517
[whispers] Okay, okay.

684
00:58:06,160 --> 00:58:10,360
Hey, there you are.
What took you so long?

685
00:58:10,445 --> 00:58:11,737
Which one is mine?

686
00:58:16,117 --> 00:58:18,494
Oh, God. You know I
don't like champagne.

687
00:58:18,578 --> 00:58:20,162
Oh, yeah.

688
00:58:23,800 --> 00:58:28,003
What did they put in your drink?
[laughing]

689
00:58:35,280 --> 00:58:38,722
Bryce!
No, no, no, no. Please, please.

690
00:58:38,806 --> 00:58:41,725
Let me see your notebook.
Let me see it.

691
00:58:47,480 --> 00:58:53,028
God, Bryce, it's just so--
I'm-l'm so sorry.

692
00:58:53,112 --> 00:58:54,905
You lied to me.

693
00:58:54,989 --> 00:58:58,116
I'm just as much a stranger
as everyone else.

694
00:58:58,201 --> 00:59:00,953
Was it me you were seeing
when we had sex?

695
00:59:01,037 --> 00:59:04,665
Answer me. Was it me
you were seeing?

696
00:59:08,840 --> 00:59:13,131
I'm so, so sorry.
Look, this face blind shit.

697
00:59:13,216 --> 00:59:15,592
I can't deal with it anymore.

698
00:59:15,677 --> 00:59:18,595
Find yourself another
jerk to wear a tie.

699
00:59:18,680 --> 00:59:20,931
Bryce.

700
00:59:22,934 --> 00:59:25,143
[cell phone rings]

701
00:59:27,360 --> 00:59:30,190
Hello.
(man) Happy birthday, Anna.

702
00:59:30,240 --> 00:59:33,986
Who is this?
Didn't my number show up?

703
00:59:37,782 --> 00:59:41,243
You really look drop dread
gorgeous tonight, Anna.

704
00:59:42,829 --> 00:59:44,997
I know your face. I've
seen you before.

705
00:59:45,081 --> 00:59:48,834
You don't know my face. You
don't know anyone's face.

706
00:59:48,918 --> 00:59:52,212
If I changed my shirt, you couldn't
tell me from your own father.

707
00:59:52,297 --> 00:59:55,507
You're the only one I don't
need to hide from, Anna.

708
00:59:55,633 --> 00:59:58,720
No, no, that wasn't me. But
maybe I'm that guy there, to

709
00:59:58,760 --> 01:00:00,220
your right. To your right.

710
01:00:00,305 --> 01:00:03,348
No, to your right, Anna! Listen
to what I'm saying!

711
01:00:03,400 --> 01:00:08,103
Please don't do this.
You saw me doing those things.

712
01:00:08,187 --> 01:00:10,480
No one has ever seen me before.

713
01:00:10,565 --> 01:00:14,484
You're the only one that can stop
me, Anna, so make it happen!

714
01:00:14,560 --> 01:00:18,447
Or I'll have to make you smile.
Smile from ear to ear.

715
01:00:18,520 --> 01:00:22,826
Please, don't do this!
Such a pretty smile...

716
01:00:22,880 --> 01:00:26,622
it will make me cry.
I'm calling the police.

717
01:00:26,706 --> 01:00:29,833
Go ahead. I have to go anyway. Your
friend's growing impatient.

718
01:00:29,880 --> 01:00:33,253
Francine?
Nina?

719
01:00:33,320 --> 01:00:36,632
Francine?
Nina?

720
01:00:36,716 --> 01:00:38,717
Francine!

721
01:00:40,880 --> 01:00:43,430
Francine. Francine!
What the hell?

722
01:00:45,520 --> 01:00:49,061
Nina. Nina!
[gasps]

723
01:00:49,120 --> 01:00:53,649
Anna? What's happening?
Anna, Anna, what's happening?

724
01:00:53,775 --> 01:00:56,526
He's here. He just called me from
my phone. Where's Francine?

725
01:00:56,611 --> 01:00:59,905
She was dancing with M r. "1
2-Out-of-10" just a moment ago.

726
01:00:59,989 --> 01:01:02,074
We have to find her. We have
to find her. He's here.

727
01:01:02,120 --> 01:01:07,704
All right, I'll call the police.
Francine!

728
01:01:07,789 --> 01:01:10,499
Oh, my God. Nina.

729
01:01:16,255 --> 01:01:19,675
[alarm goes off, people shouting]

730
01:01:27,058 --> 01:01:28,684
(Nina) Anna.

731
01:01:30,311 --> 01:01:32,354
Anna!

732
01:01:33,731 --> 01:01:36,066
[sirens wailing]

733
01:01:46,744 --> 01:01:49,162
Set up a perimeter
and comb the area.

734
01:01:49,240 --> 01:01:54,042
I'll deal with the paperwork.
[toilet flushing]

735
01:02:02,343 --> 01:02:06,096
Okay. You got me. I confess.

736
01:02:06,180 --> 01:02:09,099
Come on, you're one scratch away
from a perfect DNA match.

737
01:02:10,017 --> 01:02:12,018
Sam.

738
01:02:12,103 --> 01:02:16,398
What is violet, striped, bloody
and floating in the crapper?

739
01:02:23,156 --> 01:02:26,700
She wanted to get married
to anyone.

740
01:02:26,784 --> 01:02:30,078
Why didn't he pick me?

741
01:02:30,163 --> 01:02:33,498
The man she was dancing
with, did you...

742
01:02:33,560 --> 01:02:37,627
see his face?
No. Only from behind.

743
01:02:37,680 --> 01:02:42,382
Can you describe him to me?
No.

744
01:02:42,467 --> 01:02:45,010
I'll get somebody to take you home.

745
01:02:47,764 --> 01:02:50,432
[whispers] Oh, Nina.
We'll meet tomorrow.

746
01:02:54,604 --> 01:02:58,106
Here. You take care
of yourself, chica.

747
01:03:11,245 --> 01:03:14,581
Your boyfriend is not
answering his phone.

748
01:03:14,665 --> 01:03:17,000
We're still trying to
get a hold of him.

749
01:03:18,961 --> 01:03:21,296
[clears throat]

750
01:03:22,965 --> 01:03:25,133
You said you argued.
What was that about?

751
01:03:30,848 --> 01:03:32,724
He found out that, uh...

752
01:03:36,145 --> 01:03:37,938
I was faking him.

753
01:03:47,840 --> 01:03:53,411
[door opening]
Bryce?

754
01:04:10,054 --> 01:04:13,181
You're standing on Bryce's jacket.

755
01:04:14,350 --> 01:04:15,934
[whispers] Sorry.

756
01:04:29,448 --> 01:04:31,324
It's my phone.

757
01:04:31,409 --> 01:04:34,160
He called me on that phone
before Francine--

758
01:04:40,376 --> 01:04:42,961
Is that the jacket Bryce was
wearing this evening?

759
01:04:45,200 --> 01:04:50,093
Yes, but--
[whispering] No, it's not Bryce.

760
01:04:50,177 --> 01:04:52,804
I know him.

761
01:04:52,889 --> 01:04:55,599
Besides, he called me that
night I was on the bridge.

762
01:04:57,643 --> 01:05:00,478
That's a little trick we're gonna
have to ask him about.

763
01:05:02,857 --> 01:05:04,900
Lanyon. Kerrest.

764
01:05:04,984 --> 01:05:08,486
No. He's gone, but guess
what we just looked in.

765
01:05:11,616 --> 01:05:13,825
So, let me get this straight.

766
01:05:13,910 --> 01:05:16,244
He strings us for a year,
and bingo...

767
01:05:16,329 --> 01:05:18,496
we get all this juicy evidence
in one night?

768
01:05:18,581 --> 01:05:21,833
I'll chew on that once we get a
DNA sample on this Bryce guy.

769
01:05:21,918 --> 01:05:23,919
I just put out a warrant
for his arrest.

770
01:05:24,003 --> 01:05:25,670
Until then...

771
01:05:27,465 --> 01:05:29,549
I'm not letting her out
of my sight, okay?

772
01:05:29,634 --> 01:05:31,134
I want her totally insulated.

773
01:05:31,218 --> 01:05:33,094
I'll talk to the D.A.
about the tie.

774
01:05:33,179 --> 01:05:35,597
I won't get anything before Monday.
You know the drill.

775
01:05:41,437 --> 01:05:43,980
I'll have her back Monday morning.

776
01:05:48,653 --> 01:05:50,570
Do you trust me?

777
01:05:53,908 --> 01:05:56,701
Let's pack your things. We're
heading out of town.

778
01:06:20,518 --> 01:06:23,186
[boat horn honking]

779
01:06:36,784 --> 01:06:38,994
Rosemary. How are you?

780
01:06:43,290 --> 01:06:44,916
Everyone knows you?

781
01:06:45,001 --> 01:06:47,210
Everyone knows everyone
on Koel Island. Hey.

782
01:06:47,294 --> 01:06:49,462
(man) Good morning.

783
01:06:49,547 --> 01:06:53,550
Just one doctor, one ATM, one mail
box. It really is another world.

784
01:06:53,600 --> 01:07:00,223
Where are the other children?
That's the whole school.

785
01:07:00,307 --> 01:07:03,351
Mrs. Hayworth. She teaches
all the grades together.

786
01:07:04,937 --> 01:07:06,730
She must be 103 by now.

787
01:07:09,240 --> 01:07:12,819
You went there?
M m-hm.

788
01:07:12,880 --> 01:07:18,450
Didn't turn out too bad...
till you had to play football.

789
01:07:32,548 --> 01:07:36,092
They've arrested Bryce.
He denies everything.

790
01:07:36,177 --> 01:07:40,513
He says someone must have slipped
the phone into his pocket.

791
01:07:40,639 --> 01:07:43,560
We'll know soon enough.
They're testing his DNA against

792
01:07:43,600 --> 01:07:44,476
the tear sample.

793
01:07:45,840 --> 01:07:48,730
[shivering]
Here.

794
01:07:55,920 --> 01:07:59,574
Thank you.
How are you holding up?

795
01:08:00,826 --> 01:08:02,577
I don't know.

796
01:08:05,748 --> 01:08:08,958
It's not just that people's
faces have changed.

797
01:08:10,753 --> 01:08:12,128
It's like...

798
01:08:13,339 --> 01:08:16,174
I had to wait...

799
01:08:16,258 --> 01:08:20,595
until I didn't recognize myself
to know who I really am.

800
01:08:22,139 --> 01:08:24,015
Close your eyes.

801
01:08:38,280 --> 01:08:41,157
That's how you looked when I first
saw you at the hospital.

802
01:08:41,242 --> 01:08:44,202
Please, don't open them just yet.

803
01:08:51,252 --> 01:08:55,213
I got a call when they
brought you in.

804
01:08:57,716 --> 01:09:00,360
You were out cold. I looked
down at you like I look down

805
01:09:00,400 --> 01:09:01,511
at Jane Does every day.

806
01:09:05,432 --> 01:09:06,933
[whispers] I don't know.

807
01:09:15,442 --> 01:09:17,861
It's like I knew you.

808
01:09:17,945 --> 01:09:21,239
Even though I'd never
seen your face.

809
01:09:26,412 --> 01:09:28,746
I know it sounds kinda wacko.

810
01:09:31,417 --> 01:09:34,752
As wacko as not recognizing
your own father.

811
01:09:41,677 --> 01:09:43,469
I can do wacko.

812
01:11:22,569 --> 01:11:24,779
[sighs]

813
01:12:08,407 --> 01:12:10,116
[muffled voice] Anna.

814
01:12:11,840 --> 01:12:15,246
Anna.
[shouts]

815
01:12:15,331 --> 01:12:16,998
Calm down, Anna, it's
okay. It's me.

816
01:12:19,835 --> 01:12:22,337
Anna, it's me, Kerrest.

817
01:12:23,756 --> 01:12:26,174
Don't you recognize me anymore?

818
01:12:27,593 --> 01:12:29,427
You've shaved?

819
01:12:32,556 --> 01:12:35,725
Yes.

820
01:12:35,851 --> 01:12:41,064
Anything that makes the face stand
out, makes it easier to identify.

821
01:12:41,120 --> 01:12:45,860
Oh, God, I was such a fool.
[gasping] Don't.

822
01:12:48,360 --> 01:12:52,617
Don't you get it?
It's not you.

823
01:12:52,701 --> 01:12:56,871
It's just a trick of my
screwed up brain!

824
01:12:58,248 --> 01:13:00,249
You're nothing special.

825
01:13:02,378 --> 01:13:04,212
You're just another face.

826
01:13:12,846 --> 01:13:14,972
[sighing] No.

827
01:13:26,193 --> 01:13:28,903
[whispers] It's you.

828
01:13:35,244 --> 01:13:37,370
It's still you.

829
01:13:38,720 --> 01:13:43,584
[whispers] It's still you.
[cell phone rings]

830
01:13:46,797 --> 01:13:48,840
Hey, Lanyon.

831
01:13:52,400 --> 01:13:56,472
And they're absolutely sure?
I'll talk to you later.

832
01:13:58,960 --> 01:14:03,980
The DNA is negative.
Bryce is not the killer.

833
01:14:05,732 --> 01:14:08,609
[clears throat and chuckles]

834
01:14:08,694 --> 01:14:10,820
Next time you have a
bad dream, I'll--

835
01:14:10,880 --> 01:14:16,242
I'll just leave you to it.
My dreams.

836
01:14:19,079 --> 01:14:22,582
I can recognize faces in my dreams.

837
01:14:22,666 --> 01:14:27,253
(Dr. Langenkamp) Hypnotism
is like a carnival mirror.

838
01:14:27,337 --> 01:14:31,591
It distorts the truth as
much as reveals it.

839
01:14:31,717 --> 01:14:37,013
Or it could have devastating
consequences on your psyche.

840
01:14:37,097 --> 01:14:39,515
That's a risk I'm willing to take.

841
01:14:42,960 --> 01:14:46,022
[clears throat]
On the count of three...

842
01:14:46,080 --> 01:14:52,111
I want you to close your eyes...
and travel back in your memories.

843
01:14:52,160 --> 01:14:59,869
You can rewind...
pause, fast forward as you wish.

844
01:14:59,920 --> 01:15:04,665
I'm counting to three now.
One

845
01:15:06,001 --> 01:15:07,835
two

846
01:15:10,297 --> 01:15:11,797
three.

847
01:15:13,640 --> 01:15:19,555
Anna, I want you to go back...
to the moment before your fall.

848
01:15:22,476 --> 01:15:24,894
[muffled voices]

849
01:15:29,680 --> 01:15:34,654
Is there anybody there with you?
His face is--

850
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:40,034
It's hazy.
[muffled screams]

851
01:15:41,440 --> 01:15:47,083
I can't make out his features.
Her impairment is causing a block.

852
01:15:47,160 --> 01:15:50,836
I can't get through it.
Not even with hypnosis.

853
01:15:50,920 --> 01:15:56,551
She knows.
She knows who she is.

854
01:15:56,635 --> 01:16:00,513
Anna? I want you to fuse the
hazy impression...

855
01:16:00,597 --> 01:16:04,058
with your attacker's face.

856
01:16:04,142 --> 01:16:07,645
Can you tell me if you've
seen him before?

857
01:16:07,720 --> 01:16:10,606
On the street.
Near your home.

858
01:16:16,613 --> 01:16:18,322
Yes.

859
01:16:23,036 --> 01:16:24,412
[echoing] Hiya.

860
01:16:26,164 --> 01:16:28,499
[muffled voice]

861
01:16:28,584 --> 01:16:31,210
Ask her if she saw him the
night he killed Francine.

862
01:16:31,295 --> 01:16:33,963
Slow the hell down. I
can't read your lips.

863
01:16:34,047 --> 01:16:36,007
The evening of her birthday.

864
01:16:38,051 --> 01:16:41,137
Anna, was he there
at your birthday?

865
01:16:42,931 --> 01:16:45,224
Yes.

866
01:16:45,350 --> 01:16:48,769
Anna, did you see him through the
two-way mirror in the line-up?

867
01:16:48,854 --> 01:16:51,606
Yes. He's behind the mirror.

868
01:16:51,690 --> 01:16:54,108
Who? Who, Anna? Who's
behind the mirror?

869
01:16:54,160 --> 01:16:57,194
But--
Anna, who is it?

870
01:16:57,279 --> 01:16:58,613
I don't know.

871
01:17:00,320 --> 01:17:03,909
I don't know. I don't know.
I don't know.

872
01:17:03,960 --> 01:17:06,912
[snaps fingers]
Hey.

873
01:17:10,667 --> 01:17:12,460
[gasps]

874
01:17:15,080 --> 01:17:18,174
Anna, what is it?
He kissed me.

875
01:17:19,560 --> 01:17:23,638
Oh, God.
Oh, God, he kissed me.

876
01:17:23,720 --> 01:17:29,560
Anna, are you all right?
It's okay.

877
01:17:29,645 --> 01:17:32,897
Lydia, I need warrants on all six
perps from the last line-up.

878
01:17:32,981 --> 01:17:34,440
I want 'em now.

879
01:17:37,027 --> 01:17:39,760
Make yourself at home. No one
knows you're here. I'll

880
01:17:39,760 --> 01:17:43,032
call you when we get 'em.
Be careful.

881
01:17:44,576 --> 01:17:46,702
Once all this is over...

882
01:17:46,787 --> 01:17:48,746
I'm gonna take you back
to Koel Island.

883
01:17:54,280 --> 01:17:58,339
You promise?
I promise.

884
01:18:14,398 --> 01:18:16,107
(Lanyon) What about the DNA?

885
01:18:16,191 --> 01:18:18,401
The tests came back negative.
Four out of six.

886
01:18:18,527 --> 01:18:22,196
None of them is our guy, Sam.
We're just jerking off here.

887
01:18:22,280 --> 01:18:25,408
Fine, go ahead. Flush your
career if you want.

888
01:18:25,534 --> 01:18:28,800
You know what I think? I think
you and Tearjerk Jack have

889
01:18:28,840 --> 01:18:30,079
something in common.

890
01:18:30,163 --> 01:18:33,400
You're both in love with her,
and that's the only reason

891
01:18:33,440 --> 01:18:34,542
she's still alive.

892
01:18:34,626 --> 01:18:38,379
- You coming or not?
- I'm gonna check on something.

893
01:18:38,463 --> 01:18:41,674
(Anna) "The lovers. It's
too late to turn back.

894
01:18:41,758 --> 01:18:44,260
It's time to make the
right choice."

895
01:19:14,916 --> 01:19:17,293
[cell phone rings]

896
01:19:27,200 --> 01:19:30,973
Hey, it's Anna. Bryce called
and he wants to meet up and...

897
01:19:31,057 --> 01:19:35,060
and I guess I just owe
him that. So, anyway.

898
01:19:35,145 --> 01:19:37,271
The address of where I'll be--

899
01:19:44,488 --> 01:19:47,114
[muffled voices]

900
01:20:04,600 --> 01:20:07,468
Hello, Anna.
It's me.

901
01:20:09,971 --> 01:20:12,598
I know.

902
01:20:12,682 --> 01:20:16,101
Only a one-armed man could tie
a knot worse than you.

903
01:20:18,897 --> 01:20:21,106
[coughs]

904
01:20:21,191 --> 01:20:24,151
I caught a cold when I was in the
detention cell, believe it or not.

905
01:20:24,200 --> 01:20:28,989
[sighs]
[sirens wailing]

906
01:20:32,369 --> 01:20:35,079
Hey, I'm taking this
scumbag with me.

907
01:20:35,163 --> 01:20:36,580
Come on.

908
01:20:38,166 --> 01:20:39,667
Watch your head.

909
01:20:41,320 --> 01:20:47,299
Look, I--
I've acted like a total asshole.

910
01:20:47,384 --> 01:20:50,010
And-and not just the
other evening.

911
01:20:50,080 --> 01:20:53,055
[clears throat]
For a long time now.

912
01:20:55,475 --> 01:20:57,518
And I'm sorry.

913
01:21:02,280 --> 01:21:06,277
Excuse me.
Here's your drinks.

914
01:21:13,994 --> 01:21:17,204
Bryce, you know I don't
like champagne.

915
01:21:40,562 --> 01:21:42,730
I thought it felt right.

916
01:21:51,031 --> 01:21:53,157
Tickets to Vegas.

917
01:22:15,722 --> 01:22:17,973
And after I squeeze out
a couple rug-rats...

918
01:22:18,058 --> 01:22:20,935
we'll buy some old money
pit and...

919
01:22:21,019 --> 01:22:24,605
slide contentedly off
into senility.

920
01:22:26,358 --> 01:22:29,860
Oh, God. Bryce, l-l tried.

921
01:22:30,862 --> 01:22:32,446
I really did.

922
01:22:35,116 --> 01:22:38,410
Every time your face kept changing
, I tried so hard.

923
01:22:38,495 --> 01:22:43,499
And you know what I found out?

924
01:22:43,625 --> 01:22:46,960
That the way you look or don't
look each morning, it really

925
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:48,128
wouldn't matter...

926
01:22:50,382 --> 01:22:52,967
if I truly loved you.

927
01:22:58,974 --> 01:23:00,307
Uh, I--

928
01:23:02,120 --> 01:23:06,981
I really didn't expect this...
after getting your text message.

929
01:23:10,902 --> 01:23:14,238
I'm sorry, I'll be right back.

930
01:23:28,503 --> 01:23:30,713
[water running]

931
01:23:52,861 --> 01:23:54,945
[sirens wailing]

932
01:23:55,030 --> 01:23:57,031
Hey, has anybody seen
my cell phone?

933
01:23:58,241 --> 01:24:01,035
[buzzing]

934
01:24:21,723 --> 01:24:23,474
Bryce!

935
01:24:23,558 --> 01:24:26,477
We have to get out of here.
We've been set up.

936
01:24:26,561 --> 01:24:28,854
I think he's here.

937
01:24:33,234 --> 01:24:35,652
Yo, Columbo. You got a light?

938
01:24:39,824 --> 01:24:42,785
[text message ringtone]

939
01:24:44,913 --> 01:24:47,039
[voice mail] Five new messages.

940
01:24:47,123 --> 01:24:49,583
Hey, it's Anna. Bryce called
and he wants to meet up.

941
01:24:49,667 --> 01:24:54,338
And I guess I just owe him that.
Anyway, the address where I'll be--

942
01:24:54,400 --> 01:24:59,760
Shit, shit, shit, shit!
[tires screech]

943
01:24:59,840 --> 01:25:06,350
It's Kerrest. Leave a message.
Hi, it's Anna. I can't get--

944
01:25:06,434 --> 01:25:08,519
Thanks for letting me smoke, man.

945
01:25:08,603 --> 01:25:14,274
Relaxed. Not like that pig who
took my smoke at the line-up.

946
01:25:14,320 --> 01:25:18,654
You should've smacked that prick.
No smoking.

947
01:25:18,738 --> 01:25:21,281
(Anna) He's behind the mirror.

948
01:25:21,366 --> 01:25:24,576
Come on, you're one scratch away
from a perfect DNA match.

949
01:25:24,661 --> 01:25:27,830
I learned to keep my mouth shut
and trust what Lanyon says.

950
01:25:45,473 --> 01:25:47,599
(Dr. Langenkamp) Whatever
happens, Anna...

951
01:25:47,684 --> 01:25:50,644
don't let the music stop.

952
01:26:05,201 --> 01:26:06,994
Bryce.

953
01:26:13,668 --> 01:26:15,711
Kiss me.

954
01:26:17,213 --> 01:26:19,339
[shouts]

955
01:26:33,062 --> 01:26:35,480
Think, Lydia. Lanyon was at
the line-up. He had access

956
01:26:35,520 --> 01:26:36,440
to all the evidence.

957
01:26:36,524 --> 01:26:39,234
The kid was the perfect smokescreen
. It all fits.

958
01:26:39,319 --> 01:26:41,236
No, screw the backup.
We don't have--

959
01:26:41,320 --> 01:26:45,741
Anna! Anna, wait!
Dammit.

960
01:26:45,825 --> 01:26:47,534
Hey, man, where are you going?

961
01:26:48,828 --> 01:26:50,871
Grey shirt. Black jacket.

962
01:26:57,120 --> 01:27:02,216
Look out!
(Kerrest) Anna! Anna!

963
01:27:02,280 --> 01:27:06,136
Anna!
Lanyon, drop it.

964
01:27:06,221 --> 01:27:09,014
Drop the gun, shithead. It's me. Don't
listen to him. He's Lanyon.

965
01:27:09,080 --> 01:27:11,934
I'm Kerrest.
Anna, run!

966
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:16,230
Stay right there. Drop the gun.
You drop it.

967
01:27:30,328 --> 01:27:32,162
Lanyon.

968
01:28:03,880 --> 01:28:08,865
Anna.
Where are you?

969
01:28:08,950 --> 01:28:10,450
Anna, it's me.

970
01:29:16,351 --> 01:29:19,061
Anna! Make sure you stay hidden.

971
01:29:21,606 --> 01:29:23,690
Backup's gonna be here.

972
01:29:24,567 --> 01:29:26,234
[gasps]

973
01:29:32,241 --> 01:29:35,243
First, there's a bloody kid...

974
01:29:35,328 --> 01:29:38,330
who sees me off his mother. You
think he'll tell someone?

975
01:29:38,400 --> 01:29:46,546
No. Not a single peep in a year.
The traumatized little fucker.

976
01:29:50,843 --> 01:29:53,428
And then there's you, Anna.

977
01:29:55,765 --> 01:29:59,351
You saw me crying when that's--

978
01:30:01,840 --> 01:30:07,317
[shouting] That's not allowed.
It wa-it was a miracle.

979
01:30:07,402 --> 01:30:10,153
You lost all the other
faces because of it.

980
01:30:10,200 --> 01:30:15,617
[shouts]
[yells]

981
01:30:15,701 --> 01:30:19,329
Oh, no, no, no, you're not doing
your little diving act again.

982
01:30:19,400 --> 01:30:23,792
[clicking]
Goddammit, Anna.

983
01:30:23,876 --> 01:30:25,669
The safety catch.

984
01:30:25,753 --> 01:30:29,339
This, Anna, is why I like
blades so much.

985
01:30:29,400 --> 01:30:33,760
(Kerrest) Anna!
[groans]

986
01:30:33,845 --> 01:30:35,762
[click]

987
01:30:46,816 --> 01:30:48,650
[softly] Anna.

988
01:30:49,880 --> 01:30:53,989
Don't move! I mean it.
It's me, Anna.

989
01:30:54,073 --> 01:30:56,700
If we stay here, we'll make
one hell of a target.

990
01:30:56,760 --> 01:31:02,497
Now, give me back my gun.
Stay where you are. I mean it.

991
01:31:03,833 --> 01:31:06,543
Anna, on-on Koel Island...

992
01:31:06,627 --> 01:31:08,712
there's a school with
half a dozen pupils.

993
01:31:11,466 --> 01:31:13,675
You recognize me now?

994
01:31:29,192 --> 01:31:33,153
What did you promise me before
you left? What did you say?

995
01:31:33,279 --> 01:31:35,947
Very good. I could have told Lanyon
about the weekend...

996
01:31:36,032 --> 01:31:39,201
but that's something only
I can know, right?

997
01:31:39,285 --> 01:31:40,494
Anna.

998
01:31:49,240 --> 01:31:53,924
Look out!
[shouts]

999
01:32:05,686 --> 01:32:07,521
I knew...

1000
01:32:08,680 --> 01:32:13,527
you were the one...
who'd end this shit.

1001
01:32:19,116 --> 01:32:21,117
Give me the gun.

1002
01:32:25,706 --> 01:32:27,374
[whispers] Here.

1003
01:32:42,160 --> 01:32:46,101
[groans]
[gunshot]

1004
01:32:46,185 --> 01:32:48,478
[groans]

1005
01:32:59,360 --> 01:33:03,285
I guess...
you will never take her...

1006
01:33:04,745 --> 01:33:06,788
to the police ball.

1007
01:33:12,044 --> 01:33:13,587
Oh, no.

1008
01:33:24,932 --> 01:33:26,683
Oh, God.

1009
01:33:27,800 --> 01:33:32,522
Oh, God, no, no.
No, no.

1010
01:33:32,607 --> 01:33:35,275
Please, don't-don't move.

1011
01:33:36,880 --> 01:33:41,448
Don't move, please.
I'm fine. Seriously, I'm fine.

1012
01:33:41,532 --> 01:33:45,201
[whispers] Don't leave me.
Please, don't leave me.

1013
01:33:45,280 --> 01:33:49,581
You can't leave me.
Oh, God.

1014
01:33:51,280 --> 01:33:55,879
[grunts]
[low whispering] Sh, don't move.

1015
01:33:55,960 --> 01:34:00,216
You'll find someone else.
You'll see.

1016
01:34:00,301 --> 01:34:02,510
You'll find someone else.

1017
01:34:02,595 --> 01:34:04,596
You don't have the
right to leave me.

1018
01:34:06,432 --> 01:34:08,350
I love you.

1019
01:34:09,769 --> 01:34:12,020
I know you don't.

1020
01:34:14,106 --> 01:34:16,775
I'm just another face
in the crowd.

1021
01:34:18,069 --> 01:34:20,153
[coughs]

1022
01:34:21,760 --> 01:34:26,409
[whispers] Don't leave.
Stay with me.

1023
01:34:31,957 --> 01:34:34,542
No.

1024
01:34:36,560 --> 01:34:41,591
Don't leave me!
Don't go!

1025
01:34:41,676 --> 01:34:46,137
Oh, no, no, no. Please, don't go.

1026
01:35:16,669 --> 01:35:20,380
[sirens wailing]

1027
01:35:47,116 --> 01:35:49,409
(Anna) I live here now.

1028
01:35:49,493 --> 01:35:53,204
The school board accepted
my transfer request.

1029
01:35:53,289 --> 01:35:56,082
[muffled voice]

1030
01:35:56,167 --> 01:36:00,879
I can identify each of
my pupils perfectly.

1031
01:36:03,340 --> 01:36:06,885
As well as the handful of people who
live here in the off season.

1032
01:36:08,929 --> 01:36:11,681
Nina comes to see me
from time to time.

1033
01:36:11,766 --> 01:36:14,184
She's still single.

1034
01:36:15,936 --> 01:36:17,896
[chuckles]

1035
01:36:17,980 --> 01:36:20,607
I'm just taking it one
step at a time.

1036
01:36:23,277 --> 01:36:26,321
Sometimes I see a face...

1037
01:36:26,405 --> 01:36:31,743
and for a second it's like
I see him again.

1038
01:36:31,827 --> 01:36:36,039
It's the only way I can keep
his face in my memory.

1039
01:36:36,120 --> 01:36:43,546
(little girl) Mommy!
But when I look into her face...

1040
01:36:43,631 --> 01:36:47,133
whatever it was that let him
get through to me...

1041
01:36:47,218 --> 01:36:49,803
he passed it on to her.

1042
01:36:52,139 --> 01:36:54,682
And just when I thought I'd
lost everything...

1043
01:36:54,767 --> 01:36:57,185
I found a face.

1044
01:36:58,800 --> 01:37:02,857
One face...
in which I can always read...

1045
01:37:04,860 --> 01:37:06,653
love.

1046
01:39:39,280 --> 01:39:44,268
â« Closer â«
â« I can see you closer â«

1047
01:39:44,320 --> 01:39:50,149
â« Wanna see you closer â«
â« To me â«

1048
01:39:50,200 --> 01:39:56,489
â« A thousand faces â«
â« Looking in All directions â«

1049
01:39:56,560 --> 01:40:02,620
â« Lead me To something â«
â« I can never see â«

1050
01:40:02,680 --> 01:40:08,918
â« Why do you Think I come here â«
â« Why do you Think I come round â«

1051
01:40:09,000 --> 01:40:15,091
â« Why do you Think I come here â«
â« Why do you Think I come round â«

1052
01:40:15,160 --> 01:40:21,389
â« And when You leave me â«
â« I can see You leaving â«

1053
01:40:21,440 --> 01:40:27,395
â« Want you To stay here â«
â« I can't take This feeling â«

1054
01:40:27,440 --> 01:40:33,568
â« Wanna feel You closer â«
â« I can't take it â«

1055
01:40:33,640 --> 01:40:40,575
â« The truth Is lost in â«
â« A thousand faces â«

1056
01:40:47,040 --> 01:40:51,961
â« Leave me â«
â« Won't you need me â«

1057
01:40:52,040 --> 01:41:01,304
â« Won't you Need me tonight â«
â« A thousand faces â«

1058
01:41:01,360 --> 01:41:07,351
â« Look in All directions â«
â« Lead me to something â«

1059
01:41:07,400 --> 01:41:13,483
â« I can never find â«
â« Why do you think I come here â«

1060
01:41:13,560 --> 01:41:19,614
â« Why do you think I come round â«
â« Why do you think I come here â«

1061
01:41:19,680 --> 01:41:25,828
â« Why do you think I come round â«
â« When you leave me â«

1062
01:41:25,880 --> 01:41:32,001
â« I can see You leaving â«
â« Won't you stay here â«

1063
01:41:32,080 --> 01:41:38,091
â« Can't take This feeling â«
â« Wanna feel You closer â«

1064
01:41:38,160 --> 01:41:44,347
â« I can take it â«
â« The truth Is lost in â«

1065
01:41:44,400 --> 01:41:50,394
â« A thousand faces â«
â« And when You leave me â«

1066
01:41:50,440 --> 01:41:56,609
â« I can see You leaving â«
â« Won't you Stay here â«

1067
01:41:56,680 --> 01:42:02,782
â« Can't take This feeling â«
â« Wanna feel You closer â«

1068
01:42:02,840 --> 01:42:08,955
â« I can't take it â«
â« The truth Is lost in â«

1069
01:42:09,039 --> 01:42:12,959
â« A thousand faces â«
