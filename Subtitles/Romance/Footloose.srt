TO LEAVE, I THOUGHT
IT WAS 'CAUSE OF ME.

1115
01:14:23,800 --> 01:14:29,005
<i>I THOUGHT IT WAS SOMETHIN'
THAT I WASN'T DOIN' RIGHT,
YOU KNOW?</i>

1116
01:14:29,072 --> 01:14:32,658
AND I FIGURED THERE WAS
SOMETHIN' THAT I COULD DO...

1117
01:14:32,725 --> 01:14:37,796
TO MAKE IT LIKE IT WAS
AND THAT HE'D WANNA STAY,
YOU KNOW?

1118
01:14:39,266 --> 01:14:42,734
BUT WHEN HE LEFT
JUST LIKE THAT...

1119
01:14:42,802 --> 01:14:47,473
AND I REALIZED THAT
EVERYTHING THAT I'D DONE,
HOPIN' THAT HE'D STAY--

1120
01:14:49,342 --> 01:14:54,713
EVERYTHING I'D DONE--
IT DIDN'T-- IT DIDN'T
MEAN SHIT, YOU KNOW?

1121
01:14:54,781 --> 01:14:56,715
DIDN'T-- DIDN'T MATTER.

1122
01:14:58,452 --> 01:15:01,753
AND I FELT LIKE,
WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE?

1123
01:15:03,823 --> 01:15:07,759
BUT NOW-- NOW...

1124
01:15:07,827 --> 01:15:10,229
I'M THINKIN'...

1125
01:15:10,297 --> 01:15:14,400
I COULD REALLY DO SOMETHIN',
YOU KNOW?

1126
01:15:14,468 --> 01:15:17,536
LIKE I COULD REALLY DO
SOMETHIN' FOR ME THIS TIME.

1127
01:15:17,604 --> 01:15:20,239
YOU KNOW?

1128
01:15:20,307 --> 01:15:23,075
OTHERWISE,
I'M JUST GONNA DISAPPEAR.

1129
01:15:38,909 --> 01:15:41,927
[Chattering]
[Man]
ALL RIGHT, VIRGINIA.

1130
01:15:41,995 --> 01:15:44,563
I GUESS THAT ENDS
THE DISCUSSION ON THIS ISSUE.

1131
01:15:44,631 --> 01:15:48,483
AND SO THE PRICE
OF A DOG LICENSE WILL GO
FROM $3.50 TO $4.50.

1132
01:15:48,551 --> 01:15:51,704
A LICENSED PET IS A HAPPY ONE.

1133
01:15:51,771 --> 01:15:54,273
AND THAT TAKES CARE
OF OLD BUSINESS. BURLINGTON?

1134
01:15:54,340 --> 01:15:58,711
[Clears Throat]
THANK YOU, UH, VIRGINIA.
THAT WAS REAL GOOD.

1135
01:15:58,779 --> 01:16:03,349
<i>ALL RIGHT.
NOW WE CAN CONSIDER, UH,
ANY NEW BUSINESS.</i>

1136
01:16:03,416 --> 01:16:07,168
<i>[Chattering]
[Clears Throat]
WAIT. EXCUSE ME.</i>

1137
01:16:07,236 --> 01:16:11,140
BEFORE WE BEGIN, I JUST WANT
TO REMIND ALL YOU KIDS.

1138
01:16:11,208 --> 01:16:14,793
WE'RE CONDUCTIN'
AN OFFICIAL MEETIN'.

1139
01:16:14,861 --> 01:16:20,148
<i>WE'RE NOT GONNA TOLERATE
ANY DISTURBANCES.</i>

1140
01:16:20,216 --> 01:16:23,569
<i>OKAY. THE FLOOR IS NOW OPEN
FOR ANY NEW BUSINESS.</i>

1141
01:16:23,636 --> 01:16:28,157
MY NAME IS REN MacCORMACK,
AND I WOULD LIKE TO MOVE...

1142
01:16:28,224 --> 01:16:31,276
ON BEHALF OF MOST OF THE SENIOR
CLASS OF BOMONT HIGH SCHOOL...

1143
01:16:31,344 --> 01:16:33,812
THAT THE LAW
AGAINST PUBLIC DANCING...

1144
01:16:33,880 --> 01:16:35,947
WITHIN THE TOWN LIMITS
OF BOMONT BE ABOLISHED.

1145
01:16:36,015 --> 01:16:39,335
[Cheering]

1146
01:16:42,422 --> 01:16:45,157
UH, MR. CHAIRMAN,
COULD I ADDRESS MYSELF TO THIS?

1147
01:16:45,224 --> 01:16:50,028
- YOU BET.
- EVEN IF THIS WAS NOT A LAW,

1148
01:16:50,096 --> 01:16:52,865
WHICH IT IS,

1149
01:16:52,932 --> 01:16:55,233
I'M AFRAID I WOULD HAVE
A LOT OF DIFFICULTY...

1150
01:16:55,301 --> 01:16:57,335
ENDORSING AN ENTERPRISE...

1151
01:16:57,403 --> 01:17:01,623
<i>WHICH IS AS FRAUGHT
WITH GENUINE PERIL...</i>

1152
01:17:01,691 --> 01:17:03,692
AS I BELIEVE THIS ONE TO BE.

1153
01:17:03,760 --> 01:17:07,279
<i>BESIDES THE LIQUOR
AND THE DRUGS...</i>

1154
01:17:07,347 --> 01:17:10,682
<i>WHICH ALWAYS SEEM TO
ACCOMPANY SUCH AN EVENT,</i>

1155
01:17:10,750 --> 01:17:15,154
THE THING THAT DISTRESSES ME
EVEN MORE, REN,

1156
01:17:15,221 --> 01:17:17,789
IS THE SPIRITUAL CORRUPTION...

1157
01:17:17,857 --> 01:17:19,959
<i>THAT CAN BE INVOLVED.</i>

1158
01:17:20,026 --> 01:17:24,029
<i>THESE DANCES
AND THIS KIND OF MUSIC
CAN BE DESTRUCTIVE.</i>

1159
01:17:24,097 --> 01:17:27,916
<i>AND, UH, REN, I'M AFRAID
YOU'RE GONNA FIND...</i>

1160
01:17:27,984 --> 01:17:31,386
THAT MOST OF THE PEOPLE
IN OUR COMMUNITY ARE GONNA AGREE
WITH ME ON THIS.

1161
01:17:31,454 --> 01:17:33,789
I DO.
[Chattering]

1162
01:17:35,826 --> 01:17:39,061
THAT'S ALL I HAVE TO SAY.
I BELIEVE A VOTE IS IN ORDER
ON THE MOTION.

1163
01:17:39,128 --> 01:17:42,732
<i>- ALL THOSE OPPOSED--
- [Ren]
WELL, EXCUSE ME.</i>

1164
01:17:42,799 --> 01:17:46,151
I WOULD JUST LIKE TO SAY
SOMETHING IF I COULD.
[Loud Chattering]

1165
01:17:46,219 --> 01:17:50,589
IT IS OUTRAGEOUS!
IF YOU THINK THAT YOU--
ELEANOR, SIT DOWN.

1166
01:17:55,128 --> 01:17:58,613
I THINK MR. MacCORMACK
HAS A RIGHT TO BE HEARD.

1167
01:17:58,681 --> 01:18:00,883
[Cheering, Whistling]

1168
01:18:05,822 --> 01:18:09,975
WELL, I JUST--
I-I JUST WANTED TO SAY
A FEW WORDS ABOUT THIS MOTION...

1169
01:18:10,043 --> 01:18:12,778
SO THAT Y-YOU WOULDN'T THINK...

1170
01:18:12,846 --> 01:18:16,481
THAT WE WERE ENCOURAGING
DESTRUCTION...

1171
01:18:16,549 --> 01:18:18,684
WITH THIS IDEA.

1172
01:18:20,970 --> 01:18:23,005
"FROM THE OLDEST OF TIMES,

1173
01:18:23,072 --> 01:18:25,340
"PEOPLE DANCED
FOR A NUMBER OF REASONS.

1174
01:18:25,408 --> 01:18:28,460
"THEY DANCED IN PRAYER...

1175
01:18:28,528 --> 01:18:31,663
<i>"OR SO THAT THEIR CROPS
WOULD BE PLENTIFUL...</i>

1176
01:18:31,731 --> 01:18:33,866
"OR SO THEIR HUNT WOULD BE GOOD.

1177
01:18:33,933 --> 01:18:38,821
"AND THEY DANCED
TO STAY PHYSICALLY FIT...

1178
01:18:38,888 --> 01:18:42,624
"AND SHOW
THEIR COMMUNITY SPIRIT.

1179
01:18:42,692 --> 01:18:45,861
AND THEY DANCED...
TO CELEBRATE."

1180
01:18:48,497 --> 01:18:52,634
AND THAT-- THAT IS THE DANCING
THAT WE'RE TALKIN' ABOUT.
[Woman] YEAH.

1181
01:18:52,702 --> 01:18:54,887
AREN'T WE TOLD...

1182
01:18:54,954 --> 01:18:58,873
IN... PSALM 149:

1183
01:19:00,576 --> 01:19:03,445
"PRAISE YE THE LORD.

1184
01:19:03,512 --> 01:19:06,848
"SING UNTO THE LORD...
A NEW SONG.

1185
01:19:08,584 --> 01:19:11,153
LET THEM PRAISE HIS NAME
IN THE DANCE."

1186
01:19:11,221 --> 01:19:14,056
AMEN.
AMEN.

1187
01:19:14,124 --> 01:19:16,391
AND IT WAS KING DAVID--

1188
01:19:16,459 --> 01:19:20,930
KIND DAVID WHO WE READ ABOUT
IN SAMUEL.

1189
01:19:20,997 --> 01:19:25,317
AND-- AND WHAT DID DAVID DO?
WHAT DID DAVID DO?

1190
01:19:25,385 --> 01:19:27,169
<i>WHAT DID DAVID DO?
[Laughter]</i>

1191
01:19:27,237 --> 01:19:30,305
"DAVID DANCED BEFORE THE LORD...

1192
01:19:30,373 --> 01:19:32,508
"WITH ALL HIS MIGHT,

1193
01:19:32,575 --> 01:19:37,730
LEAPING-- LEAPING AND DANCING
BEFORE THE LORD."

1194
01:19:37,797 --> 01:19:40,398
LEAPING AND DANCING.

1195
01:19:47,907 --> 01:19:50,959
ECCLESIASTES ASSURES US...

1196
01:19:52,862 --> 01:19:55,864
THAT THERE IS A TIME
FOR EVERY PURPOSE UNDER HEAVEN--

1197
01:19:58,268 --> 01:20:01,036
A TIME TO LAUGH...

1198
01:20:01,103 --> 01:20:03,038
AND A TIME TO WEEP,

1199
01:20:04,807 --> 01:20:07,842
A TIME TO MOURN...

1200
01:20:07,910 --> 01:20:09,844
<i>AND THERE IS
A TIME TO DANCE.</i>

1201
01:20:22,358 --> 01:20:25,427
AND THERE WAS A TIME
FOR THIS LAW, BUT NOT ANYMORE.

1202
01:20:25,495 --> 01:20:27,929
SEE, THIS IS
OUR TIME TO DANCE.

1203
01:20:27,997 --> 01:20:33,602
IT IS OUR WAY OF--
OF... CELEBRATING LIFE.

1204
01:20:35,972 --> 01:20:38,190
THAT'S THE WAY IT WAS
IN THE BEGINNING.

1205
01:20:39,793 --> 01:20:41,726
IT'S THE WAY
IT'S ALWAYS BEEN.

1206
01:20:43,129 --> 01:20:45,230
IT'S THE WAY
IT SHOULD BE NOW.

1207
01:21:04,750 --> 01:21:08,420
[Andy]
YOU KNOW YOU WERE RAILROADED,
DON'T YA? HUH?

1208
01:21:09,589 --> 01:21:13,759
BOY, WHEN ARE YOU GONNA WAKE UP
AND SMELL THE COFFEE?

1209
01:21:13,826 --> 01:21:17,696
SHAW MOORE WALKED INTO
THAT MEETIN' WITH THEM VOTES
ALREADY IN HIS POCKET.

1210
01:21:17,764 --> 01:21:20,599
YOU DIDN'T HAVE A PRAYER.
BAD PUN, ANDY.

1211
01:21:23,068 --> 01:21:25,870
WELL, WHAT ARE YOU
GONNA DO NOW?

1212
01:21:25,938 --> 01:21:28,206
IT'S OVER.

1213
01:21:28,274 --> 01:21:30,309
WHAT IF IT AIN'T?

1214
01:21:30,376 --> 01:21:32,977
WHAT IF YOU HAD YOUR DANCE
IN BAYSON?

1215
01:21:33,045 --> 01:21:36,080
NO. UH-UH. THE WHOLE POINT WAS
TO DO SOMETHIN' HERE IN BOMONT.

1216
01:21:36,148 --> 01:21:38,583
BAYSON'S,
WHAT, 30 MILES AWAY?

1217
01:21:40,019 --> 01:21:42,788
NOT WHERE IT RUNS UP
TO THESE TRACKS, IT AIN'T.

1218
01:21:44,256 --> 01:21:46,191
HUH?

1219
01:21:46,258 --> 01:21:49,495
WELL, I FIGURE IF THE BOMONT
FIRE TRUCKS CAN'T CROSS
THESE TRACKS,

1220
01:21:49,562 --> 01:21:51,497
NEITHER CAN THE LONG ARM
OF THE LAW.

1221
01:21:51,564 --> 01:21:53,899
YEAH, WHAT ABOUT THE LONG ARM
OF REVEREND MOORE?

1222
01:21:53,966 --> 01:21:56,451
REMEMBER HE SAID IF YOU COULD
FIND A WAY TO CONVINCE HIM,

1223
01:21:56,519 --> 01:21:58,687
IT WOULDN'T BE A SPIRITUAL
CORRUPTION, HE'D THINK ABOUT IT.

1224
01:21:58,755 --> 01:22:01,623
SO?
MAKE HIM THINK ABOUT IT.

1225
01:22:07,029 --> 01:22:09,864
[Reverend]
"AND I BEHELD AND HEARD
AN ANGEL...

BY REASON OF THE SMOKE
OF THE PIT."

1237
01:22:50,106 --> 01:22:52,775
- YES?
- I USED TO GET SUCH A KICK...

1238
01:22:52,842 --> 01:22:55,777
OUT OF WATCHING YOU WORK UP
YOUR SERMONS.

1239
01:22:57,814 --> 01:23:01,533
- AND NOW?
- IT'S DIFFERENT.

1240
01:23:01,600 --> 01:23:04,836
<i>I SEE THE STAGE.
I SEE COSTUMES.</i>

1241
01:23:04,904 --> 01:23:07,205
IT'S SHOW BUSINESS,
ISN'T IT?

1242
01:23:09,492 --> 01:23:12,594
WELL,

1243
01:23:12,662 --> 01:23:17,533
IT'S THE ONLY WAY I KNOW TO...
REACH PEOPLE'S EMOTIONS.

1244
01:23:21,454 --> 01:23:24,255
I HAVEN'T HEARD FROM YOU
FOR A WHILE.

1245
01:23:26,158 --> 01:23:28,493
WHEN WAS IT, THURSDAY?

1246
01:23:29,712 --> 01:23:31,780
I WAS ANGRY
AND YOU WERE ANGRY.

1247
01:23:33,282 --> 01:23:35,450
I WAS NOT.
YES, YOU WERE.

1248
01:23:37,703 --> 01:23:41,739
IF YOU WEREN'T, YOU WOULD HAVE
ASKED ME WHAT WAS WRONG.
YOU KNEW.

1249
01:23:41,807 --> 01:23:46,145
ARIEL, I CANNOT
LET THIS DANCE HAPPEN.

1250
01:23:46,212 --> 01:23:48,347
REN MacCORMACK MADE
A LOT OF PEOPLE STOP AND THINK.

1251
01:23:48,414 --> 01:23:51,133
I OBJECT TO THAT KIND OF MUSIC,
AND I THINK YOU KNOW WHY.

1252
01:23:51,201 --> 01:23:53,801
-BECAUSE PEOPLE FORNICATE TO IT.
-I NEVER SAID THAT.

1253
01:23:53,869 --> 01:23:56,972
-THAT'S WHAT YOU TOLD THE BOARD.
-THAT WAS NOT MEANT
FOR YOUR EARS!

1254
01:23:57,040 --> 01:23:59,474
WHEN DO MY EARS GET OLD ENOUGH?
WHEN YOU STOP PROTECTIN' ME!

1255
01:23:59,542 --> 01:24:03,328
- I'M NO SAINT, YOU KNOW.
- IT IS MY DUTY TO LOOK AFTER
THE SPIRITUAL GROWTH OF THIS--

1256
01:24:03,395 --> 01:24:05,631
I'M NOT EVEN A VIRGIN.

1257
01:24:08,134 --> 01:24:10,935
<i>DON'T YOU TALK LIKE THAT
IN HERE!
WHY NOT?</i>

1258
01:24:11,003 --> 01:24:14,089
ISN'T THIS WHERE I'M SUPPOSED
TO CONFESS MY SINS
TO MY PREACHER?

1259
01:24:14,156 --> 01:24:16,608
IN CHURCH!
I ASK TO BE FORGIVEN!

1260
01:24:16,676 --> 01:24:21,496
- AM I? OH, FORGIVE ME
AND DELIVER ME!
- YOU GET OUT OF HERE!

1261
01:24:21,564 --> 01:24:24,850
- [Indistinct]
- THANK HEAVENS YOU'RE HERE.
PEOPLE ARE CALLING.

OVER AT THE LIBRARY.</i>

[Clapping, Chattering]

1264
01:24:31,891 --> 01:24:33,892
ROGER, ELEANOR,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

1265
01:24:33,959 --> 01:24:37,929
WE DECIDED THESE BOOKS
ARE INFLUENCES ON OUR CHILDREN
WE JUST DON'T NEED.

1266
01:24:37,997 --> 01:24:41,199
WHOSE AUTHORITY DO YOU HAVE?
YOU AGREED
THIS WAS GARBAGE.

1267
01:24:41,267 --> 01:24:43,835
WAIT. EVERYBODY, LISTEN TO ME!

1268
01:24:43,903 --> 01:24:45,904
[Panting]

1269
01:24:45,972 --> 01:24:49,007
WHEN DID YOU ALL DECIDE
TO SIT IN JUDGEMENT?

1270
