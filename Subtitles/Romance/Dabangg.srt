1
00:01:43,875 --> 00:01:48,125
Makkhi, do you know what the
sweetest thing in this world is?

2
00:01:48,417 --> 00:01:49,667
Mango.

3
00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:52,458
I bet. By the time we grow up..

4
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,458
..there'll be sugarcane growing
in the entire village. - How?

5
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,250
The land belongs to our father.

6
00:01:59,417 --> 00:02:01,292
So we're its owners, aren't we?

7
00:02:03,125 --> 00:02:04,458
Makkhi is a fool.

8
00:02:04,667 --> 00:02:07,000
Everything in this house
belongs to the two of you equally.

9
00:02:07,417 --> 00:02:10,125
And why would Mr. Pandey
distinguish between his children.

10
00:02:10,542 --> 00:02:11,708
He's a father to the two of you.

11
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:13,292
Step-father.

12
00:02:13,542 --> 00:02:15,000
He's only Makkhi's father.

13
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:17,583
If he really considered me his son..

14
00:02:17,667 --> 00:02:19,667
..he wouldn't have
treated me like a servant.

15
00:02:20,292 --> 00:02:21,750
Don't say that, son.

16
00:02:22,875 --> 00:02:26,292
You were only two years old
when your father passed away.

17
00:02:26,458 --> 00:02:30,667
You can never imagine what a
widowed mother has to face.

18
00:02:30,875 --> 00:02:33,000
That's when Mr. Pandey married me.

19
00:02:33,583 --> 00:02:35,250
Accepted you as his son.

20
00:02:35,667 --> 00:02:37,000
He gave you his name.

21
00:02:37,292 --> 00:02:41,000
'Your son's stars
are very fortunate.'

22
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,667
'Make him a businessman.
- I see.'

23
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:46,667
Makkhi is weak, son.

24
00:02:47,333 --> 00:02:48,583
He's a fool.

25
00:02:48,667 --> 00:02:50,708
Doesn't concentrate on studies.

26
00:02:51,333 --> 00:02:53,000
But he's my son after all.

27
00:02:53,167 --> 00:02:54,750
I gave birth to him.

28
00:02:55,583 --> 00:02:58,875
He's your brother.
- Step-brother.

29
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,250
Astrologer, check my
horoscope as well.

30
00:03:01,292 --> 00:03:04,292
You need to pay his fees first.

31
00:03:04,583 --> 00:03:06,750
You've money to show
this dimwit's horoscope..

32
00:03:06,875 --> 00:03:08,167
..but not for us.

33
00:03:08,333 --> 00:03:09,458
Insolent.

34
00:03:26,167 --> 00:03:28,542
Why are you crying?

35
00:03:29,583 --> 00:03:31,542
I'm cursing your fate dimwit.

36
00:03:31,583 --> 00:03:32,625
I see.

37
00:03:33,417 --> 00:03:35,542
The day I become someone..

38
00:03:36,625 --> 00:03:39,292
..I will make you
father-son's plight so bad..

39
00:03:40,292 --> 00:03:42,292
Just the thought makes me laugh.

40
00:03:43,417 --> 00:03:44,625
Move.

41
00:04:26,458 --> 00:04:27,625
Move!

42
00:04:35,417 --> 00:04:36,625
Move aside.

43
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:41,625
What's going on here?

44
00:04:43,167 --> 00:04:44,542
Come on, out with it.

45
00:04:44,625 --> 00:04:48,000
Everyone leave behind
your goods and step aside.

46
00:04:48,292 --> 00:04:49,417
Come on.

47
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:40,333
This is strange.

48
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:43,042
Do you know the penalty of
killing a police officer?

49
00:05:43,292 --> 00:05:46,208
21 years of
imprisonment along with thrashing.

50
00:05:47,875 --> 00:05:50,292
And if this police
officer shot you..

51
00:05:51,167 --> 00:05:55,625
..then guaranteed promotion.
And a medal too.

52
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:54,500
This was just the trailer.

53
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:57,042
The real picture starts now.

54
00:07:53,042 --> 00:07:54,500
Here. Here.

55
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:57,625
Give it to me.

56
00:08:01,458 --> 00:08:02,875
Give me money.

57
00:08:04,292 --> 00:08:05,375
Give me.

58
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:10,000
That's a nice caller-tune.

59
00:08:10,042 --> 00:08:11,208
Forward it to me.

60
00:08:57,625 --> 00:08:58,917
Hi. Bye.

61
00:09:29,167 --> 00:09:32,042
No, no, no, no.

62
00:09:34,958 --> 00:09:37,250
No, no, no, no don't
hit me. Don't hit me.

63
00:09:37,333 --> 00:09:39,500
That's just great.
You made me tired.

64
00:09:39,625 --> 00:09:40,917
I didn't come here to beat you.

65
00:09:40,958 --> 00:09:43,042
You robbed the
bank and I robbed you.

66
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:53,375
Answer the call, whose call is it?

67
00:09:57,042 --> 00:10:00,375
My mother.
- Give my regards.

68
00:10:03,083 --> 00:10:04,792
On that note I remembered.

69
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:07,083
Why you..
- Sir.

70
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:14,792
I was just asking if he's
got a mother. - She's dead.

71
00:10:15,917 --> 00:10:17,917
If you continue doing this..

72
00:10:18,917 --> 00:10:22,917
..then someday I'll
send you to your mother.

73
00:10:23,917 --> 00:10:25,083
Remember that.

74
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:35,250
Stop. Yes.

75
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:37,500
The force is finally here.

76
00:10:37,833 --> 00:10:40,375
Welcome. Please, welcome.

77
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:41,958
Hello, sir.

78
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:43,792
We're present on duty, sir.

79
00:10:43,833 --> 00:10:45,042
Where are the rascals?

80
00:10:45,167 --> 00:10:46,917
On that note I just remembered,
Chaubey..

81
00:10:47,042 --> 00:10:49,375
..how is your respected father?

82
00:10:49,375 --> 00:10:51,833
He's doing fine, sir.
- Good.

83
00:10:51,917 --> 00:10:53,167
Look, the robbers are lying inside.

84
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:55,375
Let those poor things go.
- Let them go.

85
00:10:55,375 --> 00:10:57,917
But then how will
you get promotion, sir?

86
00:10:57,917 --> 00:10:59,208
I'll tell you how, Chaubey.

87
00:10:59,375 --> 00:11:00,500
Make a report.

88
00:11:00,625 --> 00:11:02,625
The police surrounded the robbers..

89
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:03,917
..and there was cross-firing.

90
00:11:04,042 --> 00:11:05,625
And one of our
young police officers..

91
00:11:05,792 --> 00:11:08,042
..was wounded in the cross-firing.

92
00:11:08,167 --> 00:11:11,750
Wounded? But
everyone's absolutely fine, sir.

93
00:11:12,958 --> 00:11:15,792
Who was wounded, Chaubey?
- Me, sir. Me.

94
00:11:15,833 --> 00:11:17,792
Does anyone else want promotion?
- No, sir.

95
00:11:17,917 --> 00:11:19,792
No, no.
- Next time.

96
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:21,375
Hold this.

97
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:22,667
Let's go.

98
00:11:28,083 --> 00:11:31,042
''Fearless.''

99
00:11:31,125 --> 00:11:33,958
''Fearless.''

100
00:11:34,083 --> 00:11:36,917
''Fearless.''

101
00:11:37,042 --> 00:11:39,958
''Fearless.''

102
00:11:40,083 --> 00:11:41,667
''Strong hearted.''

103
00:11:41,792 --> 00:11:43,208
''Looks like a rock.''

104
00:11:43,375 --> 00:11:45,917
''Always first to fight.''

105
00:11:46,042 --> 00:11:48,917
''Fearless.''

106
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:51,958
''Fearless.''

107
00:11:52,042 --> 00:11:54,958
''A fighter, always willing.''

108
00:11:55,042 --> 00:11:57,667
''Looks like the leader.''

109
00:11:57,750 --> 00:12:00,667
''Fearless.''

110
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:03,792
''Fearless.''

111
00:12:03,917 --> 00:12:06,917
''He does the impossible.''

112
00:12:07,042 --> 00:12:12,375
''His roar breaks
the deadly silence.''

113
00:12:12,375 --> 00:12:15,375
''Fearless.''

114
00:12:15,375 --> 00:12:18,500
''Fearless.''

115
00:12:47,917 --> 00:12:50,958
''When it's a
question of his honour.''

116
00:12:51,042 --> 00:12:53,792
''He can even lay down his life.''

117
00:12:53,917 --> 00:12:57,083
''He's the savoir.''

118
00:12:57,125 --> 00:12:59,125
''The fearless one.''

119
00:12:59,792 --> 00:13:02,708
''He's brave.''

120
00:13:02,792 --> 00:13:05,708
''Never lets his prey out of sight.''

121
00:13:05,833 --> 00:13:08,792
''Always strikes his enemy.''

122
00:13:08,917 --> 00:13:11,125
''The fearless one.''

123
00:13:12,042 --> 00:13:15,000
''He does the impossible.''

124
00:13:15,083 --> 00:13:22,667
''His roar breaks
the deadly silence.''

125
00:13:22,708 --> 00:13:26,250
''Fearless.''

126
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:28,000
''Strong hearted.''

127
00:13:28,125 --> 00:13:29,708
''Looks like a rock.''

128
00:13:29,792 --> 00:13:32,375
''Always first to fight.''

129
00:13:32,542 --> 00:13:35,375
''Fearless.''

130
00:13:35,375 --> 00:13:38,375
''Fearless.''

131
00:13:38,667 --> 00:13:41,667
''A fighter, always willing.''

132
00:13:41,708 --> 00:13:44,250
''Looks like the leader.''

133
00:13:44,375 --> 00:13:47,125
''Fearless.''

134
00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:50,250
''Fearless.''

135
00:13:56,125 --> 00:13:58,917
''Fearless.''

136
00:13:58,958 --> 00:14:02,000
''Fearless.''

137
00:14:02,083 --> 00:14:04,917
''Fearless.''

138
00:14:04,958 --> 00:14:08,250
''Fearless.''

139
00:14:27,375 --> 00:14:28,667
Makkhi.

140
00:14:34,708 --> 00:14:35,917
Get up.

141
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:37,833
There's no water in the tap.

142
00:14:39,375 --> 00:14:40,583
What should I do?

143
00:14:40,917 --> 00:14:43,667
The tank must be empty.
- How?

144
00:14:43,792 --> 00:14:45,792
The tank will be filled
only when we have electricity.

145
00:14:45,917 --> 00:14:48,250
Your father doesn't have servants.

146
00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:50,958
I don't have a father either.

147
00:14:51,375 --> 00:14:55,125
If I had a father I
would've made it really big.

148
00:14:55,250 --> 00:14:57,250
Chulbul, mind your language.

149
00:14:59,542 --> 00:15:01,708
If you're so proud of yourself..

150
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:04,542
..then why don't you
install a generator?

151
00:15:04,583 --> 00:15:06,000
This is your house as well.

152
00:15:06,375 --> 00:15:07,833
And I've heard..

153
00:15:08,542 --> 00:15:11,125
..that you're really prospering
in your police job these days.

154
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:12,667
Really?

155
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,250
Pandey.

156
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:23,250
You're jealous of my progress.

157
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:27,250
You're a grown up now
don't you have any manners.

158
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:30,375
Mother, people have
conducted a research.

159
00:15:30,417 --> 00:15:32,875
They say that eating bread increases
the blood-count in the body.

160
00:15:33,542 --> 00:15:35,250
Give me two extra bread pieces.

161
00:15:36,125 --> 00:15:37,375
It'll increase the
blood-count in my body.

162
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:38,875
Give a glow on my face.

163
00:15:41,417 --> 00:15:43,958
You're strange, Mother.
- Father.

164
00:15:46,708 --> 00:15:47,958
I'm leaving, Mother.

165
00:15:51,958 --> 00:15:54,250
Get up.
- Chulbul. Chulbul.

166
00:15:54,417 --> 00:15:55,792
Have you gone mad?

167
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,250
Listen.

168
00:16:02,583 --> 00:16:05,667
Mother has the
duplicate keys to the safe.

169
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:07,792
Take the money from mother..

170
00:16:07,875 --> 00:16:10,250
..and buy a portable
generator from the market.

171
00:16:10,875 --> 00:16:12,792
Buy the most expensive one.

172
00:16:12,875 --> 00:16:14,125
Miser.

173
00:16:14,417 --> 00:16:15,542
Get up!

174
00:16:16,417 --> 00:16:17,667
Get up!

175
00:16:18,375 --> 00:16:20,250
If you wake me up like this..

176
00:16:20,417 --> 00:16:23,000
..God won't forgive you.
- Really?

177
00:16:23,667 --> 00:16:25,583
Which God? The God
of 'Makkhi's' (flies).

178
00:16:28,125 --> 00:16:29,708
Chaubey, is everything fine?

179
00:16:30,125 --> 00:16:32,250
Yes, sir. Everything's fine.

180
00:16:32,417 --> 00:16:34,833
But, sir, my left hand
has become useless now.

181
00:16:35,417 --> 00:16:37,542
It becomes very inconvenient for me.

182
00:16:38,792 --> 00:16:40,125
You're absolutely right, Chaubey.

183
00:16:41,417 --> 00:16:44,250
Don't worry. I've sent an
application to the government.

184
00:16:44,667 --> 00:16:47,375
Soon I'll get a spray
fitted in your bathroom.

185
00:16:50,667 --> 00:16:54,000
Can we talk?
- Yes, sir.

186
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:02,875
This is Rs.100,000 for you.
- But, sir..

187
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Yes. I accepted money for
letting the robbers run away.

188
00:17:07,417 --> 00:17:09,708
The government gives
Rs.50,000 to the wounded..

189
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,375
..and Rs.100,000 for the deceased.

190
00:17:12,542 --> 00:17:15,000
And that too to the
dead soldier's wife.

191
00:17:15,542 --> 00:17:18,125
You're the first
soldier in this country..

192
00:17:18,792 --> 00:17:21,583
..that's getting Rs.100,000.

193
00:17:21,792 --> 00:17:25,292
And you're also
receiving it yourself.

194
00:17:25,375 --> 00:17:27,000
That's great.

195
00:17:27,542 --> 00:17:29,542
Sister-in-law, there's
another benefit in it. - Yes.

196
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:31,833
His left hand is useless now.

197
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:35,542
So he'll drop the bad habit
of chewing tobacco. - Yes.

198
00:17:36,542 --> 00:17:38,667
Shall we go, Chaubey?
- Yes.

199
00:17:38,833 --> 00:17:41,125
And resume duty soon.
- Yes.

200
00:17:42,375 --> 00:17:43,750
Give it to me.

201
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,750
Sir is just.. He's too decent.

202
00:17:55,708 --> 00:17:57,000
That's 50,000.

203
00:17:57,583 --> 00:17:58,750
Will it be sufficient?

204
00:17:59,667 --> 00:18:02,667
And my commission.
- What? Commission.

205
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,583
It's your brother's money.

206
00:18:04,708 --> 00:18:06,417
And you want
commission from this as well.

207
00:18:06,583 --> 00:18:09,000
Yes. I am asking for it,
and not stealing it.

208
00:18:09,417 --> 00:18:13,292
Ask Chulbul for it. I
can't give you anything.

209
00:18:13,417 --> 00:18:15,542
Why? Aren't you my mother?

210
00:18:16,125 --> 00:18:17,667
Don't talk nonsense, Makkhi.

211
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:19,125
What nonsense.

212
00:18:19,250 --> 00:18:21,125
You always support Chulbul.

213
00:18:21,542 --> 00:18:23,250
I feel like I don't have a mother.

214
00:18:24,542 --> 00:18:26,417
I feel like an orphan.

215
00:18:29,583 --> 00:18:30,875
Fine.

216
00:18:31,667 --> 00:18:32,833
Okay.

217
00:18:37,292 --> 00:18:38,875
Here. Keep this.

218
00:18:39,667 --> 00:18:41,750
And don't talk such nonsense.

219
00:18:42,125 --> 00:18:44,000
Chulbul has lost his mind.

220
00:18:44,292 --> 00:18:45,833
And you've become so dramatic.

221
00:18:46,667 --> 00:18:48,250
I want 2000 more.

222
00:18:51,542 --> 00:18:54,125
Here. Are you happy now?

223
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:29,292
Makkhi, run.

224
00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:31,333
Run, Makkhi.

225
00:19:31,458 --> 00:19:33,000
I won't keep running each time.

226
00:19:33,333 --> 00:19:34,625
When we do want to get married..

227
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:36,167
..then why don't I discuss it now.

228
00:19:37,292 --> 00:19:38,542
Isn't it, Teacher?

229
00:19:40,125 --> 00:19:43,625
I've already spoken
to your father, son.

230
00:19:44,292 --> 00:19:47,708
Its best that you forget Nirmala..

231
00:19:48,125 --> 00:19:52,000
..and leave quietly.
- Or else what will you do?

232
00:19:52,875 --> 00:19:54,625
Makkhi.
- What Makkhi?

233
00:19:55,250 --> 00:19:56,750
He doesn't know me.

234
00:19:57,125 --> 00:19:59,750
He doesn't have any
stature before me.

235
00:19:59,875 --> 00:20:01,708
The stone with my
name floats on water.

236
00:20:01,875 --> 00:20:03,292
You can try it if you want.

237
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,292
It sunk.

238
00:20:21,875 --> 00:20:24,292
It's just a figure of speech.

239
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:27,000
But let me tell
you clearly, Teacher.

240
00:20:27,250 --> 00:20:28,875
There are just two
ways that I know of.

241
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,750
Either give your
daughter in marriage properly..

242
00:20:30,875 --> 00:20:32,875
..or else I will abduct Nirmala.

243
00:20:33,292 --> 00:20:34,750
How will you abduct her?

244
00:20:35,167 --> 00:20:36,417
Where will you take her?

245
00:20:36,625 --> 00:20:40,625
Your greedy father doesn't
want a loving daughter..

246
00:20:41,292 --> 00:20:43,542
..but a rich one.

247
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,167
You're very strong, aren't you?

248
00:20:46,458 --> 00:20:48,458
Go and deal with your father first.

249
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,542
Then you can talk to me.

250
00:20:51,875 --> 00:20:53,333
Let's go, dear. Come on.

251
00:20:53,542 --> 00:20:55,000
Let's go from here.

252
00:20:55,208 --> 00:20:59,000
Let's go.

253
00:21:03,875 --> 00:21:06,417
Stop. We're here.

254
00:21:09,417 --> 00:21:10,750
Brother has come to
the Police Head Quarters.

255
00:21:10,875 --> 00:21:12,292
Hello, Minister. Please come.

256
00:21:12,542 --> 00:21:14,125
Smile.

257
00:21:15,625 --> 00:21:18,208
Please come. - Lallan,
order for sherbet. - Yes, sir.

258
00:21:24,167 --> 00:21:26,000
Chulbul Pandey.
- Go on.

259
00:21:26,167 --> 00:21:27,292
Yes, sir.

260
00:21:27,417 --> 00:21:28,875
How are you, Pandey?
- Absolutely fit, sir.

261
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,125
Good.

262
00:21:30,208 --> 00:21:32,458
Let me introduce you
to him. Mr. Chedi Singh.

263
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:34,750
The president of the 'Lok
Manch' Student's Council.

264
00:21:35,042 --> 00:21:37,208
He works along with minister Dayal.

265
00:21:37,417 --> 00:21:38,750
Inspector Chulbul Pandey.

266
00:21:39,125 --> 00:21:40,500
You wanted to see him, isn't it?

267
00:21:42,292 --> 00:21:45,167
I've heard a lot about you.
- Thank you.

268
00:21:46,750 --> 00:21:49,333
But only for the wrong reasons.

269
00:21:51,167 --> 00:21:52,292
Tell me.

270
00:21:52,417 --> 00:21:55,000
There have been three robberies in
your area in the past two months.

271
00:21:55,125 --> 00:21:58,292
And I heard that this time the
police also surrounded the robbers.

272
00:21:59,167 --> 00:22:00,750
Why didn't you shoot the rascals?

273
00:22:02,042 --> 00:22:03,292
When we shoot a bullet..

274
00:22:03,333 --> 00:22:06,208
..it's not assured
who it's going to hit.

275
00:22:06,875 --> 00:22:09,208
It's normal for people to be
present in a public place.

276
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:11,417
Who will look after them?

277
00:22:13,042 --> 00:22:14,875
You two continue your arguments..

278
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,417
..I'll go take my rounds.

279
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:18,875
Look after the minister, Pandey.
- Yes, sir.

280
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,167
I'll be right back.

281
00:22:24,875 --> 00:22:26,583
Are you scared of the robbers?

282
00:22:27,333 --> 00:22:29,500
I'm not even scared of my father.

283
00:22:32,042 --> 00:22:33,208
Come.

284
00:22:37,042 --> 00:22:40,208
I've heard that you've
taken all the money..

285
00:22:40,333 --> 00:22:43,042
..for letting dacoit
Murari Singh go scot-free.

286
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:45,625
I didn't even know
that the dacoit I caught..

287
00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:47,333
..his name is Murari Singh.

288
00:22:47,750 --> 00:22:49,292
How did you find out?

289
00:22:49,458 --> 00:22:51,500
Murari Singh is one
of our party workers.

290
00:22:51,875 --> 00:22:53,583
His responsibility is fund-raising.

291
00:22:54,417 --> 00:22:57,042
And this time you looted
the fund that he gathered.

292
00:22:57,750 --> 00:22:59,042
I won't ask you to
return the money..

293
00:22:59,083 --> 00:23:02,083
..but you will work
for me, won't you?

294
00:23:06,417 --> 00:23:07,625
What if I refuse?

295
00:23:10,875 --> 00:23:13,292
You shouldn't lock horns
with the ruler of the jungle.

296
00:23:14,167 --> 00:23:16,042
I'm slightly stubborn.

297
00:23:16,167 --> 00:23:17,417
Think about it.

298
00:23:17,625 --> 00:23:22,292
There're more hunters and less
lions in the jungle these days.

299
00:23:22,417 --> 00:23:24,042
Don't roar too loudly..

300
00:23:24,167 --> 00:23:25,750
..or else you
might be skinned alive.

301
00:23:28,625 --> 00:23:30,292
You've faith in yourself.

302
00:23:30,750 --> 00:23:33,292
I've faith, courage
and strength as well.

303
00:23:34,167 --> 00:23:37,875
And I'm crazy beyond imagination.

304
00:23:40,375 --> 00:23:42,208
Chotu, take a photo.

305
00:23:42,458 --> 00:23:43,875
Smile.

306
00:23:44,167 --> 00:23:45,375
Just this much.

307
00:23:45,458 --> 00:23:47,208
It'll come handy for
adorning the garland.

308
00:23:54,375 --> 00:23:55,875
Stout ones on that side.

309
00:23:56,083 --> 00:23:57,375
Slim ones on this side.

310
00:23:57,750 --> 00:24:00,000
And fitter ones, follow me.

311
00:24:00,917 --> 00:24:02,750
What's wrong with the police force?

312
00:24:43,167 --> 00:24:44,375
Sir, he ducked in 'Teli' alley.

313
00:24:44,458 --> 00:24:45,750
Come quickly, sir.

314
00:24:47,042 --> 00:24:48,375
We're police officials.

315
00:24:48,750 --> 00:24:50,208
There's firing going on outside.

316
00:24:50,875 --> 00:24:52,500
At least keep the latch closed.

317
00:24:54,375 --> 00:24:56,083
Thankfully I was there.

318
00:24:56,750 --> 00:24:58,292
What if something
would've happened to you?

319
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:01,083
Do you know how
hurt I would've been?

320
00:25:04,208 --> 00:25:06,625
Are you married?
- No.

321
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:12,917
Who else is there in the house?
- My father.

322
00:25:13,167 --> 00:25:14,500
He's sleeping inside.

323
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:18,625
Has he been looking for
a groom for you? - No.

324
00:25:20,750 --> 00:25:21,917
That's good.

325
00:25:25,208 --> 00:25:26,500
Take this.

326
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:29,958
You look very stern.

327
00:25:31,292 --> 00:25:32,500
Shall we go?

328
00:26:44,750 --> 00:26:45,875
Its call from your mother.

329
00:26:45,958 --> 00:26:48,208
Why don't you answer it? Answer it.

330
00:26:48,250 --> 00:26:50,333
No, it's my girlfriend.
- Girlfriend?

331
00:26:50,375 --> 00:26:51,625
Yes. Yes.

332
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:20,500
Its time for you to die.

333
00:27:32,083 --> 00:27:33,792
There's always a first time.

334
00:27:34,375 --> 00:27:35,625
Always a next time.

335
00:27:38,375 --> 00:27:41,250
Next time. You too.

336
00:27:43,375 --> 00:27:44,500
Next time.

337
00:27:44,625 --> 00:27:46,792
Why do you come to
me whenever you fail?

338
00:27:46,958 --> 00:27:49,208
Do you come to me
when you're with a girl?

339
00:27:49,250 --> 00:27:50,500
Now go face him. Rascals.

340
00:27:50,667 --> 00:27:52,500
That Pandey is really crazy.

341
00:27:53,042 --> 00:27:54,500
He's after me.

342
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:55,750
Save me.

343
00:27:55,792 --> 00:27:57,375
If you can't beat them..

344
00:27:57,500 --> 00:28:00,042
..you can at least try
to stay out of his sights.

345
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:01,667
What do you mean?

346
00:28:02,208 --> 00:28:04,500
Disappear. Completely underground.

347
00:28:04,625 --> 00:28:07,042
And don't surface
until I don't tell you to.

348
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:09,375
I'll think of something
to do with Chulbul Pandey.

349
00:28:09,625 --> 00:28:10,792
Get lost.

350
00:28:11,792 --> 00:28:14,042
It's the power of his police post.

351
00:28:14,792 --> 00:28:17,792
That Chulbul Pandey is
just a cheap inspector.

352
00:28:18,125 --> 00:28:21,667
Get him suspended
for a false charge..

353
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:26,250
..then we'll have a fair
fight and see who's stronger.

354
00:28:27,792 --> 00:28:29,625
Tell me something, Kasturilal.

355
00:28:30,042 --> 00:28:31,500
What do you think?

356
00:28:32,042 --> 00:28:33,917
Who's the biggest
villain in Lalganj?

357
00:28:38,625 --> 00:28:41,625
You're the biggest villain here.

358
00:28:41,667 --> 00:28:42,833
Here.

359
00:28:42,917 --> 00:28:44,375
Break the coconut.

360
00:28:54,917 --> 00:28:56,083
See that.

361
00:28:57,208 --> 00:28:59,250
I always thought
that I was the hero..

362
00:28:59,375 --> 00:29:01,042
..and he thinks I am the villain.

363
00:29:02,667 --> 00:29:04,250
Do I look like a villain to you?

364
00:29:09,250 --> 00:29:11,042
Tell me something, Kasturilal.

365
00:29:13,792 --> 00:29:17,125
What do you think is going
on in my mind right now?

366
00:29:21,250 --> 00:29:24,125
Right now.. you look very angry.

367
00:29:25,083 --> 00:29:26,375
What are you saying?

368
00:29:26,667 --> 00:29:27,792
If I really was angry..

369
00:29:27,917 --> 00:29:29,792
..I would've smashed the
coconut on your head and not his.

370
00:29:30,667 --> 00:29:32,500
You're my future father-in-law.

371
00:29:33,125 --> 00:29:37,250
How is your daughter?
- She's waiting for you.

372
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:39,375
To come and marry her.

373
00:29:39,375 --> 00:29:41,792
And you're trying to
break this alliance.

374
00:29:42,792 --> 00:29:45,375
What have I done?
- That's the problem.

375
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:46,917
You haven't done anything.

376
00:29:47,125 --> 00:29:48,625
Go and do something.

377
00:29:48,833 --> 00:29:50,958
Go find out everything
about Chulbul Pandey.

378
00:29:51,042 --> 00:29:52,792
Where does he go, where he lives?

379
00:29:52,833 --> 00:29:54,375
What does he eat, his house,
relatives, property.

380
00:29:54,375 --> 00:29:55,667
Everything.

381
00:29:57,083 --> 00:29:59,625
He has really made me suffer a lot.

382
00:30:00,625 --> 00:30:02,375
Now I will make him suffer.

383
00:30:03,792 --> 00:30:05,500
Clear this up.

384
00:30:09,667 --> 00:30:13,667
The government has given me an offer
for government quarters. - Is it?

385
00:30:13,708 --> 00:30:17,375
Forget this nonsense
and come with me. - Why?

386
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,542
Why should I go?

387
00:30:20,708 --> 00:30:22,500
Who will look after
Makkhi and Pandey?

388
00:30:22,542 --> 00:30:25,833
Makkhi and Pandey are
not concerned about you.

389
00:30:25,917 --> 00:30:28,833
I said I won't go anywhere.

390
00:30:29,917 --> 00:30:34,375
I can sever all my
relations for your happiness.

391
00:30:37,250 --> 00:30:40,542
Have you thought about
a mother's condition..

392
00:30:40,667 --> 00:30:43,792
..when she has to choose
between two of her sons.

393
00:30:47,250 --> 00:30:49,083
I was just teasing you.

394
00:30:50,125 --> 00:30:52,833
You get excited, get breathless..

395
00:30:53,083 --> 00:30:54,500
..and make me run around.

396
00:30:54,917 --> 00:30:56,125
Where is your pump?

397
00:30:59,375 --> 00:31:00,917
How many times have I told you..

398
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,000
..always keep your pump with you.

399
00:31:04,625 --> 00:31:05,792
But no.

400
00:31:06,917 --> 00:31:08,083
Here.

401
00:31:14,375 --> 00:31:16,917
I've been repeatedly
asking you to leave..

402
00:31:17,708 --> 00:31:19,375
..because if we stay
here too long..

403
00:31:19,917 --> 00:31:22,542
..then soon Mr. Pandey
will need a pump as well.

404
00:31:26,833 --> 00:31:29,125
But we won't wait a
day after the marriage.

405
00:31:30,542 --> 00:31:33,125
Whose marriage?
- Mr. Pandey's.

406
00:31:33,542 --> 00:31:36,250
Mr. Pandey?
- Chulbul Pandey.

407
00:32:03,833 --> 00:32:07,417
Is Sumant Kumar here?

408
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:08,667
There's no point in
thinking about someone..

409
00:32:08,708 --> 00:32:10,000
..who isn't there anymore.

410
00:32:10,250 --> 00:32:11,417
Let's go home.

411
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:14,250
Let's go, Father.
- My bottle of alcohol.

412
00:32:14,417 --> 00:32:15,833
Don't create a scene.

413
00:32:16,125 --> 00:32:17,542
Let's go.
- She's beating me.

414
00:32:17,667 --> 00:32:18,833
You're drunk, Father.

415
00:32:18,875 --> 00:32:20,958
She doesn't let me drink.

416
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,875
'Erotta'. 'Erotta'.

417
00:32:22,958 --> 00:32:25,000
I want a drink.

418
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,583
What was he calling you?

419
00:32:37,417 --> 00:32:38,667
I don't know.

420
00:32:40,417 --> 00:32:45,542
What does 'Erotta' mean?
- I don't know.

421
00:32:48,792 --> 00:32:51,667
Was he drunk?
- Yes.

422
00:32:54,542 --> 00:32:58,250
How do you know him?
- He's my father.

423
00:32:59,250 --> 00:33:00,417
I see.

424
00:33:03,125 --> 00:33:05,583
Then he can call you anything.

425
00:33:07,875 --> 00:33:09,250
It's his right.

426
00:33:22,125 --> 00:33:24,250
Yes, Mr. Shukla,
we'll deliver the goods.

427
00:33:24,417 --> 00:33:26,583
But first pay the
previous outstanding.

428
00:33:31,125 --> 00:33:32,250
What is it?

429
00:33:32,542 --> 00:33:34,667
I want to marry Nirmala, papa.

430
00:33:35,583 --> 00:33:36,792
I know.

431
00:33:36,875 --> 00:33:38,667
Talk to the teacher.

432
00:33:43,125 --> 00:33:44,667
Can I ask you something?

433
00:33:44,792 --> 00:33:47,875
It's my life, so it
should be my choice.

434
00:33:50,125 --> 00:33:52,417
No need to argue.

435
00:33:53,417 --> 00:33:55,667
I know your likes and dislikes.

436
00:33:56,458 --> 00:34:00,792
I toil here day and night
to make your life better.

437
00:34:01,458 --> 00:34:04,708
And all you're
concerned about is love.

438
00:34:06,417 --> 00:34:08,875
This factory doesn't
function on its own, Makkhi.

439
00:34:09,417 --> 00:34:11,750
I owe a large sum of money to
the bank which they loaned me.

440
00:34:12,125 --> 00:34:15,417
My last hope was that I'll get
something from your marriage..

441
00:34:15,417 --> 00:34:17,417
..so that I can repay the loan.

442
00:34:18,375 --> 00:34:20,125
Who will repay the loan?

443
00:34:20,542 --> 00:34:22,000
I didn't build this factory.

444
00:34:22,125 --> 00:34:24,542
Why are you breaking my alliance?
- Quiet, useless.

445
00:34:25,292 --> 00:34:27,000
Did you have to fall in love..

446
00:34:27,125 --> 00:34:29,125
..with that poor
teacher's daughter?

447
00:34:30,417 --> 00:34:35,000
I will take every decision
for you until I am alive.

448
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,458
You can stay with me if you agree..

449
00:34:38,292 --> 00:34:40,000
..or you can leave my house.

450
00:35:00,250 --> 00:35:04,750
Where did you go..
leaving all this open?

451
00:35:05,375 --> 00:35:07,000
Do you want anything?

452
00:35:12,875 --> 00:35:15,875
How much?
- Rs.250.

453
00:35:17,125 --> 00:35:19,125
You're robbing a police official.

454
00:35:25,125 --> 00:35:28,333
I don't have change.
- That's okay.

455
00:35:29,292 --> 00:35:30,750
I'll collect it some other day.

456
00:35:44,333 --> 00:35:46,000
I wanted a single piece.

457
00:35:47,542 --> 00:35:48,750
Why are you giving me two?

458
00:35:48,875 --> 00:35:50,125
I always repay debts.

459
00:35:51,417 --> 00:35:54,125
Next time you can return
it and take your money.

460
00:35:54,875 --> 00:35:56,250
Give it.

461
00:36:00,292 --> 00:36:03,417
Can I leave?

462
00:36:05,708 --> 00:36:08,292
Rs.500 for chatting for a minute.

463
00:36:11,750 --> 00:36:13,458
That's another 500.

464
00:36:14,125 --> 00:36:15,542
I dropped them.

465
00:36:37,875 --> 00:36:39,292
For those two pots.

466
00:36:39,625 --> 00:36:41,167
You made a mistake.

467
00:36:42,167 --> 00:36:43,625
I never charge for mistakes.

468
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,875
I'm paying their price
and not doing charity.

469
00:36:46,417 --> 00:36:47,875
I'm giving it willingly, keep it.

470
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,125
Or else I could've
slapped you as well.

471
00:36:50,708 --> 00:36:52,542
I'm not afraid of
being slapped, sir..

472
00:36:53,583 --> 00:36:54,875
..but certainly of love.

473
00:37:00,708 --> 00:37:07,292
''I keep staring at you all day.''

474
00:37:10,250 --> 00:37:13,875
''Your eyes..''

475
00:37:19,417 --> 00:37:22,708
''Your eyes..''

476
00:37:38,625 --> 00:37:44,750
''I keep staring at you all day.''

477
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:51,000
''Your eyes dwell in mine.''

478
00:37:51,333 --> 00:37:56,583
''Your eyes dwell in mine.''

479
00:37:56,625 --> 00:37:59,625
''Your bewitching eyes.''

480
00:37:59,750 --> 00:38:02,750
''Have stolen my heart.''

481
00:38:02,875 --> 00:38:05,875
''Have stolen my heart.''

482
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:09,167
''Your bewitching eyes.''

483
00:38:09,292 --> 00:38:12,292
''Your bewitching eyes.''

484
00:38:12,333 --> 00:38:15,458
''Have stolen my heart.''

485
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:18,500
''Have stolen my heart.''

486
00:38:18,625 --> 00:38:22,208
''Your bewitching eyes.''

487
00:38:29,167 --> 00:38:41,500
''The heart skipped a
beat when I first saw you.''

488
00:38:41,750 --> 00:38:54,125
''Love blossomed
and made me smolder.''

489
00:38:54,208 --> 00:39:00,500
''I dream only about you now.''

490
00:39:00,625 --> 00:39:06,750
''I fell like I've changed.''

491
00:39:06,875 --> 00:39:12,292
''I fell like I've changed.''

492
00:39:12,417 --> 00:39:15,417
''Your bewitching eyes.''

493
00:39:15,417 --> 00:39:18,500
''Have stolen my heart.''

494
00:39:18,625 --> 00:39:21,625
''Have stolen my heart.''

495
00:39:21,750 --> 00:39:25,417
''Your bewitching eyes.''

496
00:39:32,208 --> 00:39:38,417
''It starts with you
and ends with you.''

497
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:44,625
''My world.''

498
00:39:44,875 --> 00:39:51,167
''It was my secret, but
the eyes revealed it.''

499
00:39:51,208 --> 00:39:57,083
''I belong to you. I
belong only to you.''

500
00:39:57,500 --> 00:40:03,625
''Your memories make me restless.''

501
00:40:03,750 --> 00:40:09,750
''You're so close yet
so far. What to do?''

502
00:40:09,875 --> 00:40:15,333
''You're so close yet
so far. What to do?''

503
00:40:15,417 --> 00:40:18,458
''Your bewitching eyes.''

504
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:21,625
''Have stolen my heart.''

505
00:40:21,750 --> 00:40:24,875
''Have stolen my heart.''

506
00:40:24,917 --> 00:40:28,042
''Your bewitching eyes.''

507
00:40:28,083 --> 00:40:31,042
''Your bewitching eyes.''

508
00:40:31,167 --> 00:40:34,292
''Have stolen my heart.''

509
00:40:34,333 --> 00:40:37,375
''Have stolen my heart.''
- How are you?

510
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:41,458
''Your bewitching eyes.''

511
00:40:46,208 --> 00:40:49,500
Since the birth of
politics in our country..

512
00:40:50,042 --> 00:40:52,625
..we've been fighting
over only five issues.

513
00:40:52,917 --> 00:40:58,375
Food. Clothing. Water.
Shelter and electricity.

514
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:01,625
When will we move ahead of them?

515
00:41:01,917 --> 00:41:06,375
Remember.. Lord Ram
satisfied his hunger..

516
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:07,750
Sir, do you want tea?

517
00:41:07,917 --> 00:41:09,917
..by eating Shabri's
half-eaten berries.

518
00:41:10,208 --> 00:41:13,500
So, friends, if you want
to save Uttar Pradesh..

519
00:41:13,625 --> 00:41:16,625
..from poverty and criminals.

520
00:41:16,750 --> 00:41:20,375
The Swarna's will have
to walk hand-in-hand..

521
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:23,333
..with the mistreated
Dalits (untouchables).

522
00:41:24,208 --> 00:41:27,875
Glory to Mr. Dayal!

523
00:41:27,917 --> 00:41:32,333
Glory to Mr. Dayal!

524
00:41:32,458 --> 00:41:35,917
Glory to Mr. Dayal!

525
00:41:36,042 --> 00:41:38,917
Glory to Mr. Dayal!

526
00:41:39,042 --> 00:41:42,167
Mr. Dayal seems more of a
confectioner than a minister.

527
00:41:43,375 --> 00:41:45,875
He speaks so sweetly, isn't it?

528
00:41:46,750 --> 00:41:48,333
He spoke about Lord Ram.

529
00:41:48,625 --> 00:41:51,375
He'll surely win the election.
- Forget it, sir.

530
00:41:51,500 --> 00:41:54,083
People have become
very advanced these days.

531
00:41:54,167 --> 00:41:55,292
I can see that.

532
00:41:56,042 --> 00:42:00,625
Look, the people want a dutiful
minister and not a religious one.

533
00:42:01,375 --> 00:42:05,042
How should our minister be?
- He should be like Mr. Dayal!

534
00:42:05,167 --> 00:42:06,292
Haven't you heard?

535
00:42:06,375 --> 00:42:08,875
Cast your vote but
don't vote your caste.

536
00:42:09,167 --> 00:42:12,500
I feel ministers like Mr.
Dayal are useless.

537
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:16,917
On that note I remembered you
didn't introduce yourself to me.

538
00:42:18,958 --> 00:42:21,792
Kasturilal Vishwakarma.

539
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:24,750
I'm looking after
the arrangements here.

540
00:42:25,625 --> 00:42:28,375
And you are?
- I am the Robin Hood here.

541
00:42:28,625 --> 00:42:31,333
Robin Hood Pandey.
- Robin Hood Pandey?

542
00:42:31,750 --> 00:42:33,500
What is your cell number?

543
00:42:34,500 --> 00:42:35,625
You want to know.

544
00:42:35,792 --> 00:42:39,500
How should our minister be?
- He should be like Mr. Dayal!

545
00:42:39,500 --> 00:42:42,917
What should I do? - I will
lose my job, try to understand.

546
00:42:43,500 --> 00:42:45,167
I don't want it, I've sufficient.
- Keep this money.

547
00:42:45,208 --> 00:42:47,333
Try to understand,
Rajo, try to understand.

548
00:42:56,792 --> 00:42:59,500
What is your name?
- Sumant Kumar.

549
00:42:59,625 --> 00:43:00,875
Why?

550
00:43:01,792 --> 00:43:03,625
I won't allow such things here.

551
00:43:03,750 --> 00:43:05,250
Why were you giving
money to that girl?

552
00:43:05,500 --> 00:43:07,042
She's my sister, Rajo.

553
00:43:11,625 --> 00:43:14,917
Your real sister?
- Yes.

554
00:43:15,042 --> 00:43:16,625
Do you know her?
- Yes.

555
00:43:19,750 --> 00:43:20,917
No.

556
00:43:21,917 --> 00:43:23,500
But I do want to know her.

557
00:43:24,167 --> 00:43:26,167
I never saw you here before.

558
00:43:27,208 --> 00:43:29,042
I work with Mr. Dayal.

559
00:43:29,375 --> 00:43:31,208
I am his P.A.
- What drink?

560
00:43:31,250 --> 00:43:34,500
Tea? Coffee?
- P.A. Personal assistant.

561
00:43:34,500 --> 00:43:37,625
I see. P.A.

562
00:43:42,375 --> 00:43:44,208
Why are you wearing
different shoes?

563
00:43:45,375 --> 00:43:47,750
It's not a style statement.
I've polio.

564
00:43:49,792 --> 00:43:51,500
Weren't you given the two drops?

565
00:43:52,042 --> 00:43:54,375
Father didn't get
time from his drinking.

566
00:44:01,625 --> 00:44:05,792
You look so cute when you're upset.

567
00:44:05,917 --> 00:44:08,208
I feel like biting your cheeks.

568
00:44:08,500 --> 00:44:11,042
Don'tjoke.
- What else should I do?

569
00:44:11,917 --> 00:44:15,042
Why did you call me when you
don't want to do anything?

570
00:44:17,083 --> 00:44:18,500
I want to marry you.

571
00:44:18,792 --> 00:44:21,917
Elope with me.
- No.

572
00:44:22,042 --> 00:44:25,375
Why not? Don't you love me?

573
00:44:27,917 --> 00:44:29,833
Love is important, Makkhi.

574
00:44:30,375 --> 00:44:32,500
But we can't elope and get married.

575
00:44:33,042 --> 00:44:35,500
Father won't be able to
tolerate the humiliation.

576
00:44:35,917 --> 00:44:37,500
Find another way.

577
00:44:38,500 --> 00:44:40,375
Talk to brother Chulbul.

578
00:44:40,625 --> 00:44:42,042
Maybe he will find a solution.

579
00:44:42,083 --> 00:44:43,250
What can he do?

580
00:44:43,375 --> 00:44:46,375
He likes to see me sad.

581
00:44:47,042 --> 00:44:50,083
Then you think of what to do.
I can't understand anything.

582
00:44:52,083 --> 00:44:54,250
Nirmala. Nirmala.

583
00:45:01,500 --> 00:45:03,042
On that note I remembered.

584
00:45:03,833 --> 00:45:07,250
Tiwari, how is sister-in-law?
- She's still alive, Sir.

585
00:45:12,500 --> 00:45:14,500
Why did you call father
to the police station?

586
00:45:15,792 --> 00:45:17,375
What has he done?

587
00:45:18,250 --> 00:45:21,958
Do you know the two of them?
- No.

588
00:45:22,250 --> 00:45:25,667
Your father tried to
rape their sister.

589
00:45:26,125 --> 00:45:29,500
When they tried to stop
him he thrashed them instead.

590
00:45:29,792 --> 00:45:31,792
Look at how they're trembling.

591
00:45:40,083 --> 00:45:42,375
I always stay with father, sir.

592
00:45:42,792 --> 00:45:44,917
I'm seeing them for the first time.

593
00:45:45,250 --> 00:45:47,750
Sometimes father
drinks too much but..

594
00:45:47,917 --> 00:45:50,667
..couldn't have
misbehaved with their sister.

595
00:45:50,833 --> 00:45:52,125
I swear.

596
00:45:52,250 --> 00:45:54,375
Fine, I believe you.

597
00:45:54,792 --> 00:45:57,042
If he wasn't your father..

598
00:45:57,500 --> 00:46:02,083
..I would've locked him up
under sections 126 and 228.

599
00:46:02,708 --> 00:46:04,792
I won't lock your father up.

600
00:46:04,833 --> 00:46:07,500
Will you smile or
stand here like a statue?

601
00:46:08,792 --> 00:46:09,917
No.

602
00:46:10,833 --> 00:46:14,500
Whoever makes her smile
will get a reward of Rs.1000.

603
00:46:14,667 --> 00:46:16,375
1000.
- Come on.

604
00:46:16,500 --> 00:46:19,125
Once a man was
urinating on the street.

605
00:46:19,250 --> 00:46:22,125
Tiwari called him and
said ''Hey, come here''.

606
00:46:22,250 --> 00:46:23,708
''Doesn't anyone catch you?''

607
00:46:23,792 --> 00:46:25,792
Do you know what he replied?

608
00:46:25,833 --> 00:46:28,958
''No, sir, in this city
we've to hold it ourselves.''

609
00:46:30,792 --> 00:46:34,833
One day a rich man called
a poor man and asked him..

610
00:46:34,917 --> 00:46:39,250
..''Tell me.. is kissing
hard-work or pleasure''.

611
00:46:39,375 --> 00:46:42,375
He replied, ''Sir, it
must be pleasure''.

612
00:46:42,542 --> 00:46:45,542
''If it was hard work you
would've made me do it.''

613
00:46:57,125 --> 00:46:58,542
What do you say?

614
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,542
500 for you and 500 for me.

615
00:47:04,083 --> 00:47:06,542
700 for you and 300 for me.

616
00:47:06,625 --> 00:47:11,000
'Erotta'. 'Erotta'. 'Erotta'.

617
00:47:20,958 --> 00:47:22,792
Fool.

618
00:47:22,833 --> 00:47:23,917
She laughed.

619
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,125
She laughed. She laughed.

620
00:47:26,250 --> 00:47:27,667
Give me my money. Give me my money.

621
00:47:27,792 --> 00:47:30,375
My Rs.1000.

622
00:47:38,250 --> 00:47:50,250
''He didn't know that
love is a enchanting.''

623
00:47:50,833 --> 00:47:53,625
''He's been smitten..''

624
00:47:53,667 --> 00:47:58,792
''He's been smitten..''

625
00:47:58,917 --> 00:48:06,792
''That he has no place to go.''

626
00:48:08,958 --> 00:48:13,833
''Your intoxicating eyes.
These intoxicating eyes.''

627
00:48:16,667 --> 00:48:21,542
''They're enchanting.
These intoxicating eyes.''

628
00:48:24,542 --> 00:48:28,583
''Your intoxicating eyes.
These intoxicating eyes.''

629
00:48:28,708 --> 00:48:32,375
''They're enchanting.
These intoxicating eyes.''

630
00:48:32,542 --> 00:48:34,583
''Don't try to stop me.''

631
00:48:34,667 --> 00:48:37,958
''I want to drink from these eyes.''

632
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,500
''Don't try to stop me.''

633
00:48:40,542 --> 00:48:44,000
''I want to drink from these eyes.''

634
00:48:44,125 --> 00:48:49,792
''It's a cruel night, I
want to feel alive.''

635
00:48:49,875 --> 00:48:53,542
''I want to savor it.''

636
00:48:53,667 --> 00:48:57,500
''I want to savor it.''

637
00:48:57,542 --> 00:49:01,417
''I want to savor it.''

638
00:49:01,500 --> 00:49:06,417
''I want to savor it.''

639
00:49:37,125 --> 00:49:42,000
''The officer in the
station is having hiccups.''

640
00:49:45,125 --> 00:49:49,667
''I think he's taken a sip as well.''

641
00:49:51,125 --> 00:49:57,125
''Build a brewery in your station.''

642
00:49:57,250 --> 00:50:00,833
''Build a brewery in your station.''

643
00:50:00,875 --> 00:50:06,542
''And drink it straight.''

644
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:10,833
''And drink it straight.''

645
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:14,542
''And drink it straight.''

646
00:50:14,583 --> 00:50:20,250
''He's a flamboyant.''

647
00:50:20,375 --> 00:50:24,000
''I want to savor it.''

648
00:50:24,125 --> 00:50:28,000
''I want to savor it.''

649
00:50:28,125 --> 00:50:32,000
''I want to savor it.''

650
00:50:32,125 --> 00:50:36,542
''I want to savor it.''

651
00:51:14,542 --> 00:51:15,750
What are you doing, Makkhi?

652
00:51:20,250 --> 00:51:21,875
Aren't you ashamed?

653
00:51:22,542 --> 00:51:25,000
Stealing in your own house.

654
00:51:25,875 --> 00:51:29,750
What was your requirement
which we couldn't fulfil?

655
00:51:30,833 --> 00:51:32,292
Forgive me, Mother.

656
00:51:33,125 --> 00:51:35,708
I just want to marry, Nirmala.

657
00:51:37,125 --> 00:51:38,750
I don't have any other option.

658
00:51:38,875 --> 00:51:41,125
I don't want to hear anything.
I don't want to hear anything.

659
00:51:41,250 --> 00:51:43,292
This is cheating, Makkhi.

660
00:51:43,417 --> 00:51:45,250
I won't deceive you, Mother.

661
00:51:45,667 --> 00:51:47,458
I will give this
money to the teacher.

662
00:51:47,542 --> 00:51:48,875
He'll give it to father..

663
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:50,875
..and this money will
come back in this house.

664
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:52,250
And Chulbul?

665
00:51:52,667 --> 00:51:54,125
What will I tell him?

666
00:51:54,250 --> 00:51:56,250
Let me get married.

667
00:51:56,542 --> 00:51:59,458
I will steal this money from
father and keep it back in the safe.

668
00:51:59,583 --> 00:52:01,000
Great, son.

669
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:02,833
That's not what I thought.

670
00:52:03,875 --> 00:52:07,875
Instead of
apologising for this robbery..

671
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,542
..you're promising
me to steal again.

672
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:16,125
Mother. - If you have any
other such corrupt intention..

673
00:52:16,333 --> 00:52:18,000
..then don't mask them.

674
00:52:18,125 --> 00:52:19,708
Tell me about them.

675
00:52:19,875 --> 00:52:21,000
I am helpless, Mother.

676
00:52:21,125 --> 00:52:24,708
Let me take this money today.
- Take it away, take the money.

677
00:52:26,458 --> 00:52:30,708
But I'll regret it all my life..

678
00:52:32,708 --> 00:52:34,000
..that I..

679
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:39,333
I gave birth to a thief.

680
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:41,250
Mother.

681
00:53:08,333 --> 00:53:09,583
You got it.

682
00:53:17,250 --> 00:53:19,417
You're looking lethal today.

683
00:53:20,875 --> 00:53:22,417
Can I sit?

684
00:53:25,542 --> 00:53:26,875
Sit.

685
00:53:30,625 --> 00:53:34,000
Do you know why I am here today?
- No.

686
00:53:34,875 --> 00:53:36,875
I want to marry you.

687
00:53:39,542 --> 00:53:40,875
What?

688
00:53:45,875 --> 00:53:47,458
I can't get married.

689
00:53:47,583 --> 00:53:48,625
Why?

690
00:53:49,625 --> 00:53:51,750
You look fine.

691
00:53:52,625 --> 00:53:56,167
Do you want to remain
unmarried all your life? - Yes.

692
00:53:58,875 --> 00:54:03,542
And what if you find a
strong and fearless man like me?

693
00:54:03,750 --> 00:54:06,542
Still you won't.
- No.

694
00:54:12,875 --> 00:54:14,458
Any reason?

695
00:54:17,417 --> 00:54:19,333
I can't leave father.

696
00:54:20,417 --> 00:54:26,000
That means.. you won't get
married until your father is alive.

697
00:54:26,125 --> 00:54:30,875
I won't get married
as long as he's alive.

698
00:54:37,292 --> 00:54:38,875
Did you make these toys?

699
00:54:39,167 --> 00:54:40,417
Yes.

700
00:54:40,750 --> 00:54:41,875
You're an artist.

701
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,000
Erotta. Erotta.

702
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:47,583
My bottle is empty.
Get me another bottle.

703
00:54:47,625 --> 00:54:49,458
Look after your father.

704
00:54:49,625 --> 00:54:51,125
Try to change him.

705
00:54:51,458 --> 00:54:54,750
And I will wait
for him to pass away.

706
00:54:55,333 --> 00:54:56,750
For you.

707
00:55:24,333 --> 00:55:26,042
There's good news for you.

708
00:55:26,625 --> 00:55:29,875
That pot-seller
refused my proposal.

709
00:55:30,167 --> 00:55:35,125
That means I'll have to
stay right here with you.

710
00:55:36,625 --> 00:55:38,042
Mother.

711
00:55:39,333 --> 00:55:40,750
Mother.

712
00:56:12,292 --> 00:56:14,458
That's just great.

713
00:56:40,875 --> 00:56:44,750
'Every father worries
more for his weaker son.'

714
00:56:45,417 --> 00:56:48,750
'That doesn't mean that
Mr. Pandey doesn't love you.'

715
00:56:49,167 --> 00:56:51,875
'But Makkhi is weaker, son.'

716
00:56:52,417 --> 00:56:53,625
'He's a fool.'

717
00:56:53,750 --> 00:56:55,625
'He doesn't concentrate on studies.'

718
00:56:56,458 --> 00:56:58,042
'But he's my son.'

719
00:56:58,333 --> 00:57:00,083
'I gave birth to him.'

720
00:57:00,625 --> 00:57:04,083
'He's your brother.
- Step-brother.'

721
00:57:04,167 --> 00:57:06,042
'Again the same thing, Chulbul.'

722
00:57:07,875 --> 00:57:12,375
'If you harbor such hatred
in life then I will die.'

723
00:57:12,750 --> 00:57:14,500
'You want to kill me, that's it.'

724
00:57:14,750 --> 00:57:18,458
'You don't love your mother.
- I do.'

725
00:57:18,750 --> 00:57:21,625
'So, son, say yes for me.'

726
00:57:26,458 --> 00:57:28,167
Look, sir.

727
00:57:33,167 --> 00:57:34,625
Fine.

728
00:57:39,458 --> 00:57:41,625
I want to compromise with you.

729
00:57:43,500 --> 00:57:45,750
Let's forget the past.

730
00:57:46,458 --> 00:57:51,000
Can't we live like father
and son from today? Together.

731
00:57:51,042 --> 00:57:54,333
Your family is
dead with your mother.

732
00:57:54,917 --> 00:57:58,042
Don't try to be a
part of our family.

733
00:57:58,083 --> 00:57:59,917
Leave us alone.

734
00:58:01,625 --> 00:58:04,625
We're not related any longer.

735
00:58:28,875 --> 00:58:30,167
You're drunk the entire day.

736
00:58:30,208 --> 00:58:32,167
You'll realize one day when
I will leave you for good.

737
00:58:32,292 --> 00:58:33,875
Let's go.
- I can't walk.

738
00:58:33,917 --> 00:58:36,917
Get up. Father.
- Look, the train's approaching.

739
00:58:37,042 --> 00:58:39,167
I will kill myself. I will.
- Wait.

740
00:58:39,292 --> 00:58:40,625
Don't make a scene.

741
00:58:40,625 --> 00:58:44,167
I will kill myself.
- Get up, Father.

742
00:58:44,167 --> 00:58:47,375
Get up, father.
- Otherwise I will kill myself.

743
00:58:47,500 --> 00:58:48,750
I am fed up of you.

744
00:58:48,917 --> 00:58:50,500
What are you doing?
- Get up, Father.

745
00:58:50,625 --> 00:58:53,042
That's the reason why brother Sumant
doesn't want to see your father.

746
00:58:53,167 --> 00:58:54,375
Have some shame.

747
00:58:54,500 --> 00:58:56,042
You've made a mess.

748
00:58:56,083 --> 00:58:58,167
Erotta. - Enough of this
daily charade, father.

749
00:58:58,208 --> 00:58:59,333
Get up now.

750
00:58:59,375 --> 00:59:00,917
Come on.
- I won't come.

751
00:59:00,958 --> 00:59:02,208
There's a train
approaching on this track now.

752
00:59:02,250 --> 00:59:04,500
Get up, Father. Get up, Father.

753
00:59:04,625 --> 00:59:06,167
Get up, Father.
Enough of your charade.

754
00:59:06,250 --> 00:59:07,625
Come on.

755
00:59:18,792 --> 00:59:20,042
Get up, Father.
- Come on.

756
00:59:22,250 --> 00:59:23,917
What are you doing?

757
00:59:23,958 --> 00:59:28,250
He's shoving me in the car.

758
00:59:41,208 --> 00:59:44,375
I want a drink. Also some ice.

759
00:59:44,500 --> 00:59:46,042
Get me some ice.

760
00:59:46,250 --> 00:59:48,250
To hell with alcohol.

761
01:01:34,042 --> 01:01:35,125
No.

762
01:01:36,250 --> 01:01:37,625
No.

763
01:01:48,667 --> 01:01:49,792
Here.

764
01:01:49,917 --> 01:01:50,917
Take it in. Take it in.

765
01:01:52,125 --> 01:01:53,250
Come on. Take it in.

766
01:01:53,833 --> 01:01:55,125
Slowly.

767
01:01:55,625 --> 01:01:57,208
Take it in.

768
01:01:59,792 --> 01:02:00,833
That's it.

769
01:02:02,375 --> 01:02:03,375
Sir.

770
01:02:04,500 --> 01:02:05,958
Sir, we've brought everything.

771
01:02:06,500 --> 01:02:08,375
But we couldn't find any
money in the cupboard, sir.

772
01:02:11,125 --> 01:02:12,208
Mother must've hidden it..

773
01:02:12,250 --> 01:02:13,833
..to keep it safe from
Mr. Pandey and Makkhi.

774
01:02:13,917 --> 01:02:15,250
We'll find it.
- Yes, sir.

775
01:02:18,792 --> 01:02:20,125
Stop. Stop.

776
01:02:22,500 --> 01:02:23,750
Reverse it.

777
01:02:38,667 --> 01:02:40,250
You don't have a rag
to wipe your nose..

778
01:02:40,625 --> 01:02:42,125
..and you're getting new
suits stitched for yourself.

779
01:02:42,250 --> 01:02:43,375
Great.

780
01:02:43,833 --> 01:02:45,042
Where did you get the money from?

781
01:02:46,500 --> 01:02:47,833
My marriage has been fixed.

782
01:02:48,500 --> 01:02:50,500
With Nirmala.
- I see.

783
01:02:51,500 --> 01:02:53,250
It was mother's wish as well.

784
01:02:53,917 --> 01:02:55,042
I see.

785
01:02:56,250 --> 01:02:59,833
Strange, mother
never mentioned it to me.

786
01:03:02,042 --> 01:03:06,375
Are you getting married for
mother or yourself? - Both.

787
01:03:10,667 --> 01:03:12,125
You must have
invited the entire village.

788
01:03:13,125 --> 01:03:15,125
Won't you invite me?
- Of course I will.

789
01:03:16,250 --> 01:03:17,542
I will if you attend it.

790
01:03:17,708 --> 01:03:20,125
But you won't come.
- I will.

791
01:03:21,250 --> 01:03:22,250
I will surely come.

792
01:03:23,250 --> 01:03:26,625
I will come with my wife.
- Did you get married?

793
01:03:26,958 --> 01:03:29,000
I haven't yet, but I will.

794
01:03:29,375 --> 01:03:30,667
And before you.

795
01:03:30,917 --> 01:03:32,000
I am elder to you.

796
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:34,083
I'll take your leave.

797
01:03:34,375 --> 01:03:35,708
And listen.
- Yes, sir.

798
01:03:35,792 --> 01:03:37,250
Don't charge him money.
- Yes, sir.

799
01:03:37,375 --> 01:03:38,917
He's my brother.
- Ok.

800
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:41,000
Come on.

801
01:03:44,250 --> 01:03:47,708
You stay drunk all day and
slander your daughter publicly.

802
01:03:47,792 --> 01:03:48,833
She's your daughter.

803
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:50,792
Why don't you do something
about her? - What should I do?

804
01:03:50,917 --> 01:03:52,625
Look, I don't know
how to twist words.

805
01:03:52,708 --> 01:03:55,542
I like your daughter and I
want to marry her. - Yes.

806
01:03:56,125 --> 01:03:57,667
I am educated and
a Brahmin by cast.

807
01:03:58,000 --> 01:03:59,250
I'm a police officer.

808
01:03:59,375 --> 01:04:00,667
Respect, honour and wealth.

809
01:04:01,250 --> 01:04:02,250
I've got everything.

810
01:04:04,542 --> 01:04:06,708
But your daughter
isn't ready to accept me.

811
01:04:07,833 --> 01:04:09,000
What am I lacking?

812
01:04:09,250 --> 01:04:10,667
You don't know her.

813
01:04:11,542 --> 01:04:13,625
She's very stubborn.

814
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:17,917
She won't get married
until I don't die. Erotta.

815
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:19,083
She told me that.

816
01:04:19,375 --> 01:04:22,125
Explain to her. Nicely,
strictly or threateningly.

817
01:04:23,667 --> 01:04:25,250
Do whatever you think is right.

818
01:04:26,083 --> 01:04:27,250
But make her agree.

819
01:04:28,917 --> 01:04:32,083
And if you can't do that
then shame on such a father.

820
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:48,125
What happened?

821
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:51,917
Will you keep my daughter happy?
- No, no.

822
01:04:52,375 --> 01:04:53,792
I will beat her, torment her.

823
01:04:53,917 --> 01:04:55,375
And then ask you for dowry.

824
01:04:55,708 --> 01:04:57,000
That's strange, father.

825
01:04:57,125 --> 01:04:58,542
You haven't noticed
my love for her yet.

826
01:05:02,958 --> 01:05:05,250
Come and take my
daughter on the 27th..

827
01:05:05,375 --> 01:05:07,375
..I will explain to her.

828
01:05:07,833 --> 01:05:09,583
I will explain to her.
- How?

829
01:05:09,917 --> 01:05:13,667
Prepare for the marriage
and leave the rest to me.

830
01:05:17,125 --> 01:05:18,250
One more thing.

831
01:05:20,250 --> 01:05:22,125
Your daughter is getting
married in a wealthy family.

832
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:24,250
And spectacularly.

833
01:05:24,708 --> 01:05:25,875
Don't stay drunk.

834
01:05:26,875 --> 01:05:31,000
I've stopped..
drinking.. from right now.

835
01:05:31,792 --> 01:05:33,667
I'll take your leave.

836
01:05:35,125 --> 01:05:36,250
Look after yourself.

837
01:06:26,375 --> 01:06:27,667
He's my father.

838
01:06:29,792 --> 01:06:30,833
Wake him up.

839
01:06:31,250 --> 01:06:34,417
Father! Father!

840
01:07:06,125 --> 01:07:07,792
You're so strange.

841
01:07:08,792 --> 01:07:11,250
I'm indebted to you now.

842
01:07:13,250 --> 01:07:16,708
I asked you to forsake
drinking and not the world.

843
01:07:28,708 --> 01:07:30,542
Come on, enough of mourning.

844
01:07:31,375 --> 01:07:33,417
He's dead now.

845
01:07:33,708 --> 01:07:36,125
Let her be a part of my life now.

846
01:07:37,250 --> 01:07:38,417
Get up.

847
01:07:39,708 --> 01:07:42,708
Increase your speed
and show some agility.

848
01:07:57,417 --> 01:07:58,542
What are you staring at?

849
01:07:59,417 --> 01:08:00,750
I want to give you a better life.

850
01:08:02,125 --> 01:08:03,750
I want to marry you.

851
01:08:05,875 --> 01:08:06,875
Come on.

852
01:08:07,375 --> 01:08:08,875
Quickly pick up your suitcase.

853
01:08:09,125 --> 01:08:12,292
Go inside and come out quickly.

854
01:08:17,875 --> 01:08:21,292
Chulbul Pandey,
congratulations for the marriage.

855
01:08:21,750 --> 01:08:23,458
Thank you father.

856
01:08:54,417 --> 01:08:55,875
Come, Chulbul.

857
01:08:56,125 --> 01:08:57,333
Welcome.

858
01:08:57,667 --> 01:08:59,125
Thank you very much.

859
01:09:00,458 --> 01:09:03,750
Teacher, the
arrangements are really nice.

860
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:07,875
Oh no, son. It's all your grace.

861
01:09:08,667 --> 01:09:12,458
If it's my grace, then
can I get married first?

862
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:16,125
What do you mean?

863
01:09:29,625 --> 01:09:30,708
Stay alert.

864
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:38,000
Come, come.

865
01:09:38,167 --> 01:09:39,333
Come ahead.

866
01:09:49,167 --> 01:09:50,542
Why did they stop playing the band?

867
01:09:50,625 --> 01:09:52,292
It's nothing, sir,
they're being stubborn.

868
01:09:52,750 --> 01:09:54,167
They say that they won't
play for two marriages..

869
01:09:54,250 --> 01:09:55,417
..for the price of one.

870
01:09:55,458 --> 01:09:56,542
Send Tiwari.

871
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:04,875
Look, Chulbul sir is
very soft at heart..

872
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:06,708
..and fearless by mind.

873
01:10:07,625 --> 01:10:10,167
And if you act smart
with a fearless man..

874
01:10:10,625 --> 01:10:13,000
..I will take you to
the police station..

875
01:10:13,333 --> 01:10:15,000
..and beat you between two legs..

876
01:10:15,167 --> 01:10:20,000
..that you won't be
capable of playing anything else.

877
01:10:20,708 --> 01:10:21,875
Get it.

878
01:10:22,167 --> 01:10:23,333
Come on, play it.

879
01:10:25,167 --> 01:10:26,583
Play it.

880
01:10:38,875 --> 01:10:40,000
Excuse me, priest.

881
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:42,167
Shall we do a little bit of walking?

882
01:10:51,750 --> 01:10:53,583
The parents of the bride
and groom come forward..

883
01:10:53,875 --> 01:10:55,875
..and bless the new couple.

884
01:11:01,875 --> 01:11:03,292
Priest, she doesn't have anyone.

885
01:11:04,292 --> 01:11:05,875
And my situation is slightly..

886
01:11:16,875 --> 01:11:19,167
There must be elders in your family.

887
01:11:20,875 --> 01:11:23,000
Yes. It's me.

888
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:25,625
I will bless myself.

889
01:11:26,125 --> 01:11:27,208
May I stay happy.

890
01:11:27,292 --> 01:11:28,750
And may she enjoy a
happy married life.

891
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:30,208
We're married now.

892
01:11:40,042 --> 01:11:44,458
I don't believe it.. that
you're your mother's son.

893
01:11:46,292 --> 01:11:48,875
I feel like spitting on your face.

894
01:11:49,458 --> 01:11:51,042
That's strange Pandey.

895
01:11:52,500 --> 01:11:54,292
I'm no Good Boy..

896
01:11:54,750 --> 01:11:58,292
..that to forgive you each
time you spit on my face.

897
01:11:58,875 --> 01:12:02,042
Get out of here.
- We're leaving.

898
01:12:02,292 --> 01:12:04,292
We didn't come here to
take your permission.

899
01:12:10,042 --> 01:12:11,167
Stop all this.

900
01:12:12,500 --> 01:12:14,208
There isn't going to
be any marriage here.

901
01:12:15,167 --> 01:12:16,625
There isn't going to
be any marriage here.

902
01:12:20,750 --> 01:12:21,875
Teacher.

903
01:12:22,208 --> 01:12:23,583
There isn't going
to be any marriage.

904
01:12:27,875 --> 01:12:29,042
Father.

905
01:12:49,042 --> 01:12:50,292
What is your name?

906
01:12:54,875 --> 01:12:57,500
My name.. suites my personality.

907
01:12:57,500 --> 01:12:58,750
Robinhood Pandey
alias Chulbul Pandey.

908
01:12:58,750 --> 01:13:00,000
Chulbul.. Pandey.

909
01:13:01,625 --> 01:13:05,167
What you did today,
Mr. Pandey, wasn't right.

910
01:13:08,458 --> 01:13:09,875
I did the right thing.

911
01:13:11,625 --> 01:13:13,417
Spend few months with me..

912
01:13:15,167 --> 01:13:18,417
..and you'll know what I do and why.

913
01:13:21,875 --> 01:13:24,042
Why would your
father call you 'Erotta'?

914
01:13:25,875 --> 01:13:27,875
Do you know what it means?
- I know.

915
01:13:29,042 --> 01:13:31,042
What is it?
- Wretch.

916
01:13:31,417 --> 01:13:33,167
Someone who has lost her honour.

917
01:13:36,333 --> 01:13:39,167
You didn't tell me
when I asked you earlier.

918
01:13:39,375 --> 01:13:41,333
I lied.
- Why?

919
01:13:43,042 --> 01:13:44,375
You know me now.

920
01:13:45,292 --> 01:13:47,000
Spend few months with me..

921
01:13:47,083 --> 01:13:51,208
..and you'll know
what I say and why.

922
01:13:52,750 --> 01:13:56,458
What did you do for which
he would call you 'Erotta'?

923
01:13:56,917 --> 01:13:58,083
Find it out?

924
01:14:03,167 --> 01:14:04,500
You can't be an 'Erotta'.

925
01:14:04,917 --> 01:14:07,083
Your father was short-sighted.

926
01:14:24,917 --> 01:14:30,375
''Your eyes are like the mirror.''

927
01:14:32,042 --> 01:14:37,625
''They tell me what
is in your heart.''

928
01:14:38,083 --> 01:14:45,292
''I didn't utter a word.''

929
01:14:45,375 --> 01:14:53,292
''My eyes narrated everything.''

930
01:14:53,458 --> 01:15:02,083
''You stole my heart at
first sight, sweetheart.''

931
01:15:04,208 --> 01:15:14,500
''You stole my heart at
first sight, darling.''

932
01:15:32,917 --> 01:15:41,250
''My life was
filled with loneliness.''

933
01:15:43,792 --> 01:15:52,208
''But it was flooded with love.''

934
01:15:53,750 --> 01:16:00,750
''The spring finally dawned..''

935
01:16:00,917 --> 01:16:08,208
''..when I fell in love with you.''

936
01:16:09,042 --> 01:16:18,208
''You stole my heart at
first sight, darling.''

937
01:16:19,875 --> 01:16:30,208
''You stole my heart at
first sight, sweetheart.''

938
01:16:51,625 --> 01:16:54,167
The booty that comes inside,
should be here..

939
01:16:54,500 --> 01:16:56,208
That goes outside
should be outside.

940
01:17:01,167 --> 01:17:02,250
What's going on?

941
01:17:02,333 --> 01:17:03,375
Can't you see?

942
01:17:03,625 --> 01:17:04,958
Do you think you own it?

943
01:17:06,042 --> 01:17:07,167
Scoundrel.

944
01:17:14,083 --> 01:17:15,625
Is this how you beat poor people?

945
01:17:15,750 --> 01:17:18,625
Move aside. Move aside. Move aside.

946
01:17:19,042 --> 01:17:20,792
Come sir. Come.
- He killed my son.

947
01:17:21,625 --> 01:17:24,375
Sir. - Sir, he
thrashed my son so cruelly.

948
01:17:24,375 --> 01:17:25,500
Sir.

949
01:17:28,375 --> 01:17:30,375
Sir, Makkhan
Pandey has thrashed him.

950
01:17:31,833 --> 01:17:33,167
Makkhi.

951
01:17:36,250 --> 01:17:38,375
Sir, get my son treated.

952
01:17:38,500 --> 01:17:40,625
We wantjustice, sir.
- Fine.

953
01:17:42,500 --> 01:17:44,208
Now I will keep
thrashing Makkhan Singh..

954
01:17:44,500 --> 01:17:46,625
..until you don't ask me to stop.

955
01:17:47,792 --> 01:17:48,917
Come on get up.

956
01:17:59,500 --> 01:18:00,958
Make me a betel leaf.
- Okay.

957
01:20:08,083 --> 01:20:11,250
Down with!
- Chulbul Pandey!

958
01:20:11,250 --> 01:20:14,625
We won't tolerate!
- ?Atrocities of the police anymore.

959
01:20:14,833 --> 01:20:17,375
The rights of the police
have been misused, Mr. Malik.

960
01:20:17,958 --> 01:20:20,000
Firstly Makkhanchand's
marriage was hijacked.

961
01:20:20,667 --> 01:20:21,917
Then he was publicly beaten.

962
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:25,917
I accept that
Makkhanchand made a mistake.

963
01:20:26,792 --> 01:20:28,000
But there's something called as law.

964
01:20:28,375 --> 01:20:31,083
You might have to pay dearly
for legal action, Chedi Singh.

965
01:20:31,250 --> 01:20:34,250
Many criminals die
everyday in police encounter.

966
01:20:34,375 --> 01:20:35,500
Don't you read the newspaper?

967
01:20:36,125 --> 01:20:38,083
I do read the newspaper,
Chulbul Pandey..

968
01:20:38,375 --> 01:20:39,792
..but maybe you don't.

969
01:20:40,125 --> 01:20:42,667
There's often news of
dead police officials.

970
01:20:42,792 --> 01:20:44,500
Please relax, sir.

971
01:20:44,792 --> 01:20:46,500
It's their family matter.

972
01:20:46,542 --> 01:20:48,375
They'll solve it amongst themselves.

973
01:20:48,625 --> 01:20:51,250
No one's going to benefit if
you include politics in this.

974
01:20:51,542 --> 01:20:53,250
We will include politics, Mr. Malik.

975
01:20:54,250 --> 01:20:55,958
Today Prajapati Pandey is helpless..

976
01:20:56,125 --> 01:20:57,250
..tomorrow it can be someone else.

977
01:20:57,375 --> 01:20:59,625
Who else will the people
look up to other than me?

978
01:21:00,125 --> 01:21:01,917
If you don't take strict
action against Chulbul Pandey..

979
01:21:01,917 --> 01:21:04,250
..then I will set the
entire village ablaze. - No, no.

980
01:21:04,667 --> 01:21:06,000
Sir, please don't do
anything like that.

981
01:21:07,250 --> 01:21:08,792
My son is hurt.

982
01:21:09,500 --> 01:21:10,625
It's my grievance.

983
01:21:11,083 --> 01:21:13,833
And anyway I don't want
to aggravate this matter.

984
01:21:14,375 --> 01:21:15,542
What do you mean?

985
01:21:16,542 --> 01:21:22,792
If Chulbul.. apologises
to Makkhanchand publicly..

986
01:21:23,125 --> 01:21:24,917
..then I'm ready to end
this matter right here.

987
01:21:25,542 --> 01:21:27,708
What are you saying?
- That's more like it.

988
01:21:27,833 --> 01:21:28,958
Wait, sir.

989
01:21:29,958 --> 01:21:33,375
Mr. Pandey, apologise
right now and end this matter.

990
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:44,250
Makkhanchand, I
humiliated you publicly.

991
01:21:45,250 --> 01:21:47,375
I apologise, please forgive me.

992
01:21:53,958 --> 01:21:55,250
There, the problem's solved.

993
01:21:55,250 --> 01:21:56,500
He has apologised.

994
01:21:59,500 --> 01:22:00,667
Please, come.

995
01:22:11,417 --> 01:22:12,958
One thing is clear, Chulbul.

996
01:22:14,250 --> 01:22:17,500
You don't like me and nor do I.

997
01:22:18,792 --> 01:22:20,375
When we've to live separately..

998
01:22:21,500 --> 01:22:23,375
..then why not live happily.

999
01:22:40,875 --> 01:22:42,000
Pandey.

1000
01:22:42,875 --> 01:22:44,000
It's a family issue.

1001
01:22:44,250 --> 01:22:46,125
I apologise again.

1002
01:23:03,875 --> 01:23:07,125
Brother-in-law, Dayal sir
has talked to the commissioner.

1003
01:23:07,375 --> 01:23:10,708
You slapped Makkhanchand
in front of Chedi Singh.

1004
01:23:12,708 --> 01:23:16,250
I can slap Chedi Singh
in front of Dayal sir.

1005
01:23:17,125 --> 01:23:18,667
Great, Brother-in-law.

1006
01:23:18,875 --> 01:23:21,125
Then Dayal sir will surely agree.

1007
01:23:22,250 --> 01:23:24,000
You're a fearless man, Pandey.

1008
01:23:24,375 --> 01:23:25,792
You always say everything clearly.

1009
01:23:26,542 --> 01:23:28,000
I hear clearly as well.

1010
01:23:31,875 --> 01:23:34,667
Chedi Singh is the
youth leader of my party.

1011
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:39,875
And you want me to oppose a
member of my party for you.

1012
01:23:40,542 --> 01:23:41,667
Why?

1013
01:23:41,833 --> 01:23:45,000
If an old ruler wants
keep his reign intact..

1014
01:23:45,792 --> 01:23:48,125
..then he has to
sacrifice his children as well.

1015
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:51,250
Chedi Singh isn't your son anyway.

1016
01:23:58,792 --> 01:24:00,000
The truth is, Pandey..

1017
01:24:00,125 --> 01:24:03,583
..I dislike Chedi
Singh as much as you do.

1018
01:24:04,750 --> 01:24:06,875
He takes undue
advantage of my name..

1019
01:24:07,542 --> 01:24:09,875
..and runs breweries.

1020
01:24:10,250 --> 01:24:12,375
Supplies illegal arms.

1021
01:24:12,750 --> 01:24:14,292
And keeps all the profit himself.

1022
01:24:15,458 --> 01:24:17,000
Think of a way by which..

1023
01:24:17,417 --> 01:24:21,667
..Chedi Singh stays in the
party but stays under my control.

1024
01:24:22,125 --> 01:24:23,292
I have many ways.

1025
01:24:23,875 --> 01:24:27,000
But it depends on
which one you want to use.

1026
01:24:31,125 --> 01:24:32,875
I can stop your suspension.

1027
01:24:34,292 --> 01:24:35,667
You stop Chedi Singh.

1028
01:24:35,750 --> 01:24:36,875
No matter which means you use.

1029
01:24:38,292 --> 01:24:40,875
But my reign should remain intact.

1030
01:24:42,833 --> 01:24:44,000
But tell me one thing..

1031
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:46,125
..why do you wear your
goggles at the back?

1032
01:24:46,125 --> 01:24:48,583
So that I can keep an eye on
the front and at the back.

1033
01:24:52,375 --> 01:24:54,458
15 people are in serious condition..

1034
01:24:54,542 --> 01:24:57,708
..due to drinking poisonous alcohol
in Madanpura area of Lalganj.

1035
01:24:57,750 --> 01:25:00,125
They've been admitted in
a government hospital..

1036
01:25:00,292 --> 01:25:01,750
..in serious condition.

1037
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:04,583
Police has seized
consignments of alcohols..

1038
01:25:04,667 --> 01:25:05,750
..from five breweries.

1039
01:25:06,125 --> 01:25:08,542
And they're searching for the
owner of all these breweries.

1040
01:25:21,125 --> 01:25:26,542
''Munni was mortified, darling,
just for you.''

1041
01:25:28,708 --> 01:25:32,583
''Munni was mortified, darling,
just for you.''

1042
01:25:32,667 --> 01:25:36,417
''Munni was mortified, darling,
just for you.''

1043
01:25:36,458 --> 01:25:41,125
''Munni's cheeks are red, eyes are
intoxicating and gait's bewitching.''

1044
01:25:41,292 --> 01:25:45,125
''She lost her mind,
darling, just for you.''

1045
01:25:45,292 --> 01:25:49,000
''Munni was mortified, darling,
just for you.''

1046
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:53,583
''Munni's cheeks are red, eyes are
intoxicating and gait's bewitching.''

1047
01:25:53,750 --> 01:25:57,458
''She lost her mind,
darling, just for you.''

1048
01:25:57,542 --> 01:26:01,333
''Munni was mortified, darling,
just for you.''

1049
01:26:01,458 --> 01:26:05,125
''Munni was mortified, darling,
just for you.''

1050
01:26:05,250 --> 01:26:10,000
''Munni was mortified, darling,
just for you.''

1051
01:26:16,417 --> 01:26:17,750
Did you send money for the people..

1052
01:26:17,750 --> 01:26:19,458
..that were
admitted in the hospital?

1053
01:26:19,625 --> 01:26:21,625
Sir, I gave them so much money..

1054
01:26:21,708 --> 01:26:23,708
..that now they'll drink whiskey.

1055
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:35,458
''A figure like Shilpa,
Bebo's attitude.''

1056
01:26:35,542 --> 01:26:37,542
''Bebo's attitude.''

1057
01:26:39,875 --> 01:26:43,000
''A figure like Shilpa,
Bebo's attitude.''

1058
01:26:43,167 --> 01:26:45,292
''Bebo's attitude.''

1059
01:26:45,458 --> 01:26:48,875
''My gaits so filmy.''

1060
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:51,000
''My gaits so filmy.''

1061
01:26:51,292 --> 01:26:56,875
''I've lots of attitude.''

1062
01:26:57,167 --> 01:27:02,625
''My attitude's worth millions.''

1063
01:27:02,750 --> 01:27:06,542
''I became famous for you.''

1064
01:27:06,625 --> 01:27:10,458
''I grew restless for you.''

1065
01:27:10,542 --> 01:27:14,167
''Munni was mortified, darling,
just for you.''

1066
01:27:14,292 --> 01:27:19,625
''Munni, everyone
talks only about you.''

1067
01:27:20,167 --> 01:27:22,417
''Munni.''

1068
01:27:23,417 --> 01:27:26,875
''Munni.''

1069
01:27:27,167 --> 01:27:30,875
''You are famous everywhere.''

1070
01:27:31,125 --> 01:27:34,750
''You're so bewitching and lovable.''

1071
01:27:34,875 --> 01:27:38,625
''You're so bewitching and lovable.''

1072
01:27:38,750 --> 01:27:40,542
''Munni.''

1073
01:27:42,875 --> 01:27:48,542
''He's such a fool.''

1074
01:27:50,167 --> 01:27:56,125
''He's such a fool.''

1075
01:27:56,417 --> 01:27:59,583
''He's here without a penny.''

1076
01:27:59,625 --> 01:28:01,875
''He's here without a penny.''

1077
01:28:02,167 --> 01:28:06,167
''He doesn't know those after me..''

1078
01:28:06,208 --> 01:28:07,875
''O my damsel!''

1079
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:13,583
''He doesn't know that
almost everyone is after me.''

1080
01:28:13,750 --> 01:28:17,500
''I lowered my standard, darling,
just for you.''

1081
01:28:17,625 --> 01:28:21,417
''I lowered my standard, darling,
just for you.''

1082
01:28:21,500 --> 01:28:26,417
''Munni was mortified, darling,
just for you.''

1083
01:28:38,625 --> 01:28:44,167
''You're intoxicating
like a bottle of alcohol.''

1084
01:28:46,292 --> 01:28:51,875
''You're intoxicating
like a bottle of alcohol.''

1085
01:28:52,167 --> 01:28:57,583
''Make me feel young again.''

1086
01:28:57,750 --> 01:29:02,333
''Your lips are luscious
and eyes are bewitching.''

1087
01:29:03,417 --> 01:29:06,583
''Your lips are luscious
and eyes are bewitching.''

1088
01:29:06,750 --> 01:29:09,292
''They steal my heart.''

1089
01:29:09,417 --> 01:29:13,292
''You turned stunning, darling,
just for me.''

1090
01:29:13,417 --> 01:29:17,000
''Munni was mortified, darling,
just for me.''

1091
01:29:17,042 --> 01:29:20,750
''Munni was mortified, darling,
just for me.''

1092
01:29:20,875 --> 01:29:25,625
''Munni's cheeks are red, eyes are
intoxicating and gait's bewitching.''

1093
01:29:25,750 --> 01:29:29,500
''She lost her mind,
darling, just for you.''

1094
01:29:29,583 --> 01:29:33,500
''Munni was mortified, darling,
just for you.''

1095
01:29:33,625 --> 01:29:37,292
''Munni was mortified, darling,
just for you.''

1096
01:29:37,333 --> 01:29:41,000
''Munni was mortified, darling,
just for you.''

1097
01:29:41,083 --> 01:29:44,750
''Munni was mortified, darling,
just for you.''

1098
01:29:44,875 --> 01:29:48,625
''I turned so youthful, darling,
just for you.''

1099
01:29:48,625 --> 01:29:50,625
''You turned so entertaining.''

1100
01:29:50,625 --> 01:29:52,500
''Just for you.''

1101
01:29:52,625 --> 01:29:54,417
''Munni was mortified.''

1102
01:29:54,500 --> 01:29:56,292
''Just for you.''

1103
01:29:56,333 --> 01:29:58,333
''You turned famous.''

1104
01:29:58,417 --> 01:30:00,625
''Darling, just for you.''

1105
01:30:02,292 --> 01:30:04,167
''Darling, just for you.''

1106
01:30:06,042 --> 01:30:07,750
''Darling, just for you.''

1107
01:30:07,875 --> 01:30:11,500
''Darling, just for you.''

1108
01:30:21,083 --> 01:30:24,042
Let's go, Munni, to your Munna.

1109
01:30:27,917 --> 01:30:31,500
Now I will make him.. lose his mind.

1110
01:30:32,625 --> 01:30:33,750
Why are you here?

1111
01:30:33,875 --> 01:30:36,375
You're so strange.

1112
01:30:37,750 --> 01:30:39,625
There's a warrant for you.

1113
01:30:40,750 --> 01:30:42,750
You're making the
headlines everywhere.

1114
01:30:43,042 --> 01:30:45,167
I've been running the
breweries for the past 11 years.

1115
01:30:46,292 --> 01:30:47,750
I never do adulteration.

1116
01:30:48,625 --> 01:30:52,625
I know it's your plan,
Chulbul Pandey.

1117
01:30:53,042 --> 01:30:55,292
And I will win this game as well.

1118
01:30:55,917 --> 01:30:59,750
I could've killed some..

1119
01:30:59,875 --> 01:31:04,042
..from those whose life I saved.

1120
01:31:04,292 --> 01:31:08,167
Are you threatening me?
- Threaten.

1121
01:31:10,500 --> 01:31:12,167
On that note I remembered.

1122
01:31:15,333 --> 01:31:17,083
Which is that big animal?

1123
01:31:20,042 --> 01:31:21,167
Elephant?

1124
01:31:21,625 --> 01:31:22,917
Elephant.

1125
01:31:24,208 --> 01:31:25,375
That is me.

1126
01:31:26,917 --> 01:31:32,917
And which is that small
animal that we.. shoo away.

1127
01:31:34,042 --> 01:31:36,750
Dog.
- Dog.

1128
01:31:38,625 --> 01:31:41,625
Him.

1129
01:31:43,292 --> 01:31:47,042
And what should the dog do..

1130
01:31:47,750 --> 01:31:49,167
..if the elephant steps
on his tail?

1131
01:31:50,167 --> 01:31:53,500
Sir, its best that
he leaves quietly.

1132
01:31:55,625 --> 01:31:58,750
Because there's just one
thing that a dog has..

1133
01:32:00,042 --> 01:32:02,750
..that saves him in
difficult times.

1134
01:32:02,875 --> 01:32:03,958
What do you want?

1135
01:32:04,042 --> 01:32:05,292
I don't want it now.

1136
01:32:06,750 --> 01:32:07,917
Hold it.

1137
01:32:08,750 --> 01:32:12,917
Until I keep getting
this bag filled with money..

1138
01:32:14,208 --> 01:32:17,292
..your hearing will
keep getting delayed.

1139
01:32:19,042 --> 01:32:20,792
And when it stops.

1140
01:32:22,167 --> 01:32:24,250
I will fill you with so many holes..

1141
01:32:24,958 --> 01:32:28,625
..that you'll be confused which
hole you should use to breathe..

1142
01:32:29,083 --> 01:32:30,333
..and which one to fart.

1143
01:32:44,208 --> 01:32:45,375
Click it.

1144
01:32:47,250 --> 01:32:48,792
Brother, smile.

1145
01:32:54,167 --> 01:32:55,250
Let's go.

1146
01:33:02,042 --> 01:33:05,042
This issue is taking
political mileage.

1147
01:33:05,875 --> 01:33:07,500
It's an inside news.

1148
01:33:08,375 --> 01:33:12,792
Chulbul Pandey is under
Dayal sir's protection.

1149
01:33:14,500 --> 01:33:16,375
Kill Chulbul Pandey.

1150
01:33:17,500 --> 01:33:18,792
What are you saying?

1151
01:33:19,500 --> 01:33:21,333
Don't you dare do that.

1152
01:33:21,625 --> 01:33:22,917
The elections are upon us.

1153
01:33:23,042 --> 01:33:24,792
And it'll prove
beneficial for Dayal sir.

1154
01:33:25,042 --> 01:33:26,625
One mistake from your side..

1155
01:33:26,792 --> 01:33:28,500
..and your name will be
cut off from the ticket list.

1156
01:33:29,792 --> 01:33:31,250
Be careful, sir.

1157
01:33:31,750 --> 01:33:33,792
You're my future son-in-law.

1158
01:33:34,042 --> 01:33:35,625
I'm quite worried.

1159
01:33:36,167 --> 01:33:37,625
Sir, smile.

1160
01:33:48,917 --> 01:33:51,375
You will kill
Chulbul Pandey and not me.

1161
01:33:51,500 --> 01:33:53,625
Me? No, no, no.

1162
01:33:53,833 --> 01:33:55,250
How can I do it?

1163
01:33:55,625 --> 01:33:57,833
Chulbul Pandey is
such a stubborn man.

1164
01:33:58,625 --> 01:34:00,375
What if something happens to me?

1165
01:34:01,750 --> 01:34:04,083
I finally managed to befriend him.

1166
01:34:05,167 --> 01:34:08,625
Do you want your
daughter to marry me..

1167
01:34:08,792 --> 01:34:12,167
..or should I look for another
girl. - No, no, I want to. I do.

1168
01:34:12,792 --> 01:34:15,375
You're putting my life at stake.

1169
01:34:17,083 --> 01:34:18,750
Find another way.

1170
01:34:24,042 --> 01:34:26,500
There's an old rule of politics,
father-in-law.

1171
01:34:29,250 --> 01:34:31,375
If you want to defeat the enemy..

1172
01:34:33,042 --> 01:34:35,667
..then find the
traitor amongst them.

1173
01:34:36,125 --> 01:34:37,375
Hail Sri Ram.

1174
01:34:43,500 --> 01:34:44,792
Why don't you return
the teacher's money..

1175
01:34:45,250 --> 01:34:47,125
..when the alliance is broken?

1176
01:34:47,917 --> 01:34:49,125
Why are you worried?

1177
01:34:50,625 --> 01:34:52,500
Teacher didn't ask for the money.

1178
01:34:55,375 --> 01:34:58,083
Anyway, he has broken
the alliance and not me.

1179
01:34:58,500 --> 01:34:59,667
Switch off the light, go to sleep.

1180
01:35:13,917 --> 01:35:15,083
Come on.

1181
01:35:15,125 --> 01:35:16,375
Don't make noise.

1182
01:36:12,375 --> 01:36:13,500
Stop. Stop!

1183
01:36:14,958 --> 01:36:16,667
How are you brother Makkhanchand?

1184
01:36:16,917 --> 01:36:18,250
Where are you going?

1185
01:36:20,625 --> 01:36:21,917
How are you?

1186
01:36:23,500 --> 01:36:24,917
Any problem?

1187
01:36:25,125 --> 01:36:27,042
I need money, sir.

1188
01:36:27,958 --> 01:36:29,375
I want to get father treated.

1189
01:36:31,250 --> 01:36:32,958
Prajapati has fallen sick.

1190
01:36:34,375 --> 01:36:37,125
Please help me.
- No, no.

1191
01:36:37,542 --> 01:36:39,125
I tried to help you last time.

1192
01:36:39,375 --> 01:36:40,792
But your father turned his back.

1193
01:36:41,083 --> 01:36:42,500
I don't want to be
humiliated anymore.

1194
01:36:42,542 --> 01:36:44,250
This time I will
do anything you say.

1195
01:36:44,542 --> 01:36:46,000
Give me one chance.

1196
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:55,125
Sit in the car.

1197
01:36:59,375 --> 01:37:00,542
Do you see that man?

1198
01:37:02,125 --> 01:37:03,250
The one that's batting.

1199
01:37:06,667 --> 01:37:07,917
Tolu Rastogi.

1200
01:37:08,542 --> 01:37:09,792
Dayal sir's aide.

1201
01:37:10,917 --> 01:37:14,500
Can you deal with him?
- I can mop the floor with him.

1202
01:37:16,958 --> 01:37:19,000
That's all I want.

1203
01:37:19,500 --> 01:37:22,375
If you can deal with him
then you'll be my aide.

1204
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:25,708
My right hand.

1205
01:37:33,667 --> 01:37:34,833
Run, run.

1206
01:37:34,917 --> 01:37:36,250
Take two, two.

1207
01:37:46,667 --> 01:37:48,375
Hey boy, return the ball.

1208
01:38:15,250 --> 01:38:17,583
Chedi Singh.
- Makkhi is with him.

1209
01:38:34,125 --> 01:38:35,833
When you aren't
related any longer..

1210
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:37,542
..then why think about it?

1211
01:38:38,250 --> 01:38:40,875
Don't you know that
Chedi Singh is a big rascal?

1212
01:38:41,000 --> 01:38:44,250
I can understand
making a mistake once.

1213
01:38:44,500 --> 01:38:46,792
But making the same mistake again.

1214
01:38:46,875 --> 01:38:48,417
That's foolishness, isn't it?

1215
01:38:49,542 --> 01:38:50,667
That Chedi Singh is
taking advantage..

1216
01:38:50,708 --> 01:38:52,792
..of the differences
between us brothers.

1217
01:39:00,375 --> 01:39:03,125
You called Makkhanchand
your brother after so long.

1218
01:39:03,667 --> 01:39:05,667
It felt nice to hear that
you consider him your brother.

1219
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:07,708
Why don't you explain to him?

1220
01:39:08,125 --> 01:39:11,833
Rajo, I can explain to him
only when he answers the phone.

1221
01:39:12,833 --> 01:39:15,708
It hurts to see your
brother in pain, isn't it?

1222
01:39:18,417 --> 01:39:19,875
Everything's not lost yet.

1223
01:39:22,250 --> 01:39:25,833
Serve the meal, I'll try once more.

1224
01:39:42,417 --> 01:39:43,792
I don't understand one thing.

1225
01:39:44,417 --> 01:39:47,583
You're giving ordinary
mangoes to such a big minister.

1226
01:39:47,667 --> 01:39:51,000
When mangoes can get the
job done then why pay money.

1227
01:39:52,833 --> 01:39:55,875
You want to keep your
father alive, isn't it? - Yes.

1228
01:39:56,000 --> 01:39:57,875
Then do as I tell you.

1229
01:39:58,417 --> 01:39:59,833
Don't ask too many questions.

1230
01:40:00,417 --> 01:40:01,542
Go out.

1231
01:40:06,250 --> 01:40:07,833
Dimwit, stupid.

1232
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:09,125
Come on.

1233
01:40:09,417 --> 01:40:12,250
Only you can do something,
please do something. - Yes, I will.

1234
01:40:12,417 --> 01:40:13,583
I will.

1235
01:40:13,667 --> 01:40:15,125
Please save him.
- Okay, please.

1236
01:40:15,250 --> 01:40:17,125
God bless you.
- Please go.

1237
01:40:17,375 --> 01:40:18,458
Sumant.
- Yes.

1238
01:40:18,542 --> 01:40:19,667
Come here.

1239
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:25,250
Yes.

1240
01:40:25,375 --> 01:40:26,458
Who else is there in your house?

1241
01:40:26,542 --> 01:40:27,708
Hello.

1242
01:40:27,792 --> 01:40:28,875
What does your elder son do?

1243
01:40:29,000 --> 01:40:31,542
There's shortage of
water in my village, sir.

1244
01:40:32,250 --> 01:40:33,708
If you could install a tube-well..

1245
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:35,542
..it would make things better.

1246
01:40:36,125 --> 01:40:38,750
Give me your name and
the name of your village.

1247
01:40:39,000 --> 01:40:40,458
We'll see what we can do.

1248
01:40:40,875 --> 01:40:43,417
I've brought
mangoes from my orchard.

1249
01:40:43,417 --> 01:40:44,542
They're absolutely fresh.

1250
01:40:44,833 --> 01:40:45,875
Fine, keep them here.

1251
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:47,125
Lets leave.
- Thank you.

1252
01:40:49,667 --> 01:40:50,750
You come.

1253
01:40:52,292 --> 01:40:53,417
Okay.

1254
01:40:56,125 --> 01:40:57,875
I want a tube-well
installed in my fields.

1255
01:40:58,125 --> 01:40:59,583
Village, Samastipur.

1256
01:40:59,667 --> 01:41:01,458
Name, Makkhanchand Pandey.

1257
01:41:01,542 --> 01:41:03,292
Samastipur.

1258
01:41:05,417 --> 01:41:07,125
I've heard your name before.

1259
01:41:08,542 --> 01:41:10,250
Are you Chulbul Pandey's brother?

1260
01:41:14,458 --> 01:41:16,125
It wouldn't have made
a difference if I was.

1261
01:41:16,375 --> 01:41:17,750
Do your work.

1262
01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:19,667
I don't know any Chulbul.

1263
01:41:46,875 --> 01:41:49,583
Uttar Pradesh's home
Minister Dayal Sahu..

1264
01:41:49,667 --> 01:41:53,125
..passed away in a
bomb blast in Lalganj.

1265
01:41:53,250 --> 01:41:54,750
This blast occurred when Dayal sir..

1266
01:41:54,833 --> 01:41:58,542
..was tending to his
public like on every Monday.

1267
01:41:58,583 --> 01:42:03,750
His cruel murder is a
big shock to our democracy.

1268
01:42:05,250 --> 01:42:07,125
Madam. Madam, you can't go inside.

1269
01:42:07,292 --> 01:42:09,000
Hello. Madam.

1270
01:42:40,875 --> 01:42:43,333
There's an ordinance
factory in Lalganj.

1271
01:42:43,542 --> 01:42:48,750
Only licensed contractors
are supplied gun powder.

1272
01:42:48,750 --> 01:42:51,250
In our
investigation we've found out..

1273
01:42:51,292 --> 01:42:53,750
..that the explosives
used in Mr. Dayal's murder..

1274
01:42:53,875 --> 01:42:56,000
..was from these factories.

1275
01:42:56,167 --> 01:42:58,417
We've suspended the licence..

1276
01:42:58,542 --> 01:43:02,000
..of all the explosives
factories in the area.

1277
01:43:02,250 --> 01:43:04,542
There are some small
ministers we doubt.

1278
01:43:04,583 --> 01:43:07,000
But we're sure to
find the guilty soon.

1279
01:43:07,125 --> 01:43:10,250
And we'll start
arresting them soon. Thank you.

1280
01:43:20,000 --> 01:43:22,167
Prayer.

1281
01:43:24,750 --> 01:43:26,708
Makkhanchand Pandey.

1282
01:43:27,750 --> 01:43:32,250
You just disappeared after
making such a big explosion.

1283
01:43:32,875 --> 01:43:34,708
Wow, son.

1284
01:43:34,750 --> 01:43:36,875
I am proud of you.

1285
01:43:37,333 --> 01:43:39,292
After what you did..

1286
01:43:39,333 --> 01:43:42,417
..now my son-in-law is
the only candidate left..

1287
01:43:42,458 --> 01:43:44,625
..from Lalganj assembly.
- Thank you.

1288
01:43:44,750 --> 01:43:46,458
Great.

1289
01:43:46,542 --> 01:43:50,708
Why didn't you tell me there
was a bomb in the box of mangoes?

1290
01:43:50,750 --> 01:43:52,875
What are you saying?

1291
01:43:53,000 --> 01:43:54,167
You're still a novice.

1292
01:43:54,333 --> 01:43:56,167
You don't understand politics.

1293
01:43:57,125 --> 01:43:58,583
Would you have done
it if I had told you?

1294
01:43:59,875 --> 01:44:03,875
You used me.

1295
01:44:04,000 --> 01:44:08,417
I never invited you to help me.

1296
01:44:08,458 --> 01:44:10,125
You came to me yourself.

1297
01:44:10,875 --> 01:44:15,625
Now.. I've a very
special job for you.

1298
01:44:15,750 --> 01:44:18,125
Come in, I'll tell you.

1299
01:44:19,750 --> 01:44:21,458
Congratulations.

1300
01:44:21,750 --> 01:44:23,875
Go on.

1301
01:44:33,750 --> 01:44:35,417
The thing is, brother..

1302
01:44:35,875 --> 01:44:38,750
..that the hands of the
law and Chedi Singh's legs..

1303
01:44:39,542 --> 01:44:41,625
..both are very long.

1304
01:44:43,000 --> 01:44:45,292
The minister has been murdered.

1305
01:44:46,000 --> 01:44:49,042
The police will
apprehend you some day.

1306
01:44:49,042 --> 01:44:52,625
And then Chulbul Pandey
is in-charge of the case.

1307
01:44:53,208 --> 01:44:54,625
He won't spare you.

1308
01:44:55,417 --> 01:44:58,750
Before he comes here and kills you..

1309
01:45:02,000 --> 01:45:05,167
..take this gun and
kill your brother. - What?

1310
01:45:05,292 --> 01:45:06,417
I am absolutely right.

1311
01:45:06,500 --> 01:45:08,750
You don't have any other option.

1312
01:45:09,208 --> 01:45:12,500
One of you has to die.

1313
01:45:15,042 --> 01:45:17,292
He isn't your kin anyway.

1314
01:45:17,417 --> 01:45:18,875
He has always tormented you.

1315
01:45:19,208 --> 01:45:20,417
Kill him.

1316
01:45:20,500 --> 01:45:21,750
End his life.

1317
01:45:23,042 --> 01:45:26,625
Who will look after father
if anything happens to you?

1318
01:45:26,875 --> 01:45:28,583
Think about it.

1319
01:45:32,333 --> 01:45:35,500
Do this lastjob for me.

1320
01:45:36,292 --> 01:45:37,875
I swear I will
reward you so handsomely..

1321
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:39,167
..that you'll always remember.

1322
01:45:52,875 --> 01:45:54,042
Makkhi.

1323
01:45:58,750 --> 01:46:00,333
Chedi Singh has sent me.

1324
01:46:01,875 --> 01:46:03,458
To kill you.

1325
01:46:06,875 --> 01:46:09,292
Then kill me.
What are you thinking?

1326
01:46:11,750 --> 01:46:13,875
You've killed Dayal sir.

1327
01:46:19,417 --> 01:46:21,208
I'm not here to kill you, Brother.

1328
01:46:22,333 --> 01:46:27,167
I am here to apologise
to you and sister-in-law.

1329
01:46:29,000 --> 01:46:31,292
I made a big mistake.

1330
01:46:32,333 --> 01:46:35,750
I didn't know there was a
bomb in the box of mangoes.

1331
01:46:37,500 --> 01:46:39,500
Our factory was burnt down.

1332
01:46:39,625 --> 01:46:42,042
'Brother Makkhanchand,
the factory is on fire.'

1333
01:46:42,208 --> 01:46:43,750
Father received a shock.

1334
01:46:43,875 --> 01:46:45,292
I need to get him treated.

1335
01:46:45,750 --> 01:46:48,875
I did everything for father.

1336
01:46:49,083 --> 01:46:53,500
And you sought Chedi Singh's help.
- I was helpless.

1337
01:46:55,375 --> 01:46:59,292
I beg you, save father.

1338
01:47:00,167 --> 01:47:01,500
He's dying.

1339
01:47:04,375 --> 01:47:06,292
Save father.

1340
01:47:15,625 --> 01:47:17,000
I'm taking your blessings.

1341
01:47:19,625 --> 01:47:21,458
If you wish to..

1342
01:47:23,042 --> 01:47:24,458
..then please bless me.

1343
01:47:26,042 --> 01:47:28,208
Forget it.

1344
01:47:29,375 --> 01:47:31,500
I am happy without your blessings.

1345
01:47:33,375 --> 01:47:34,458
Can I sit?

1346
01:47:36,375 --> 01:47:38,208
I met your doctor.

1347
01:47:38,375 --> 01:47:41,042
He was saying that you'll
live only for a few more days.

1348
01:47:41,375 --> 01:47:43,375
I slapped him.

1349
01:47:43,750 --> 01:47:46,042
And you got a longer lifespan.

1350
01:47:49,917 --> 01:47:51,042
Look, Mr. Pandey.

1351
01:47:52,750 --> 01:47:58,000
The arrogance and
pride that I see in you..

1352
01:48:00,750 --> 01:48:02,750
..is not real.

1353
01:48:05,083 --> 01:48:08,750
All my life I've
been shocked many times.

1354
01:48:09,500 --> 01:48:11,458
First was my father's death.

1355
01:48:14,375 --> 01:48:15,917
Next was your arrival.

1356
01:48:17,625 --> 01:48:20,083
And then my mother's death.

1357
01:48:21,292 --> 01:48:26,167
And now if you leave me..
I will go crazy.

1358
01:48:29,750 --> 01:48:37,375
Look, it'll sound
strange after so many years.

1359
01:48:38,500 --> 01:48:44,375
..but now.. I will..

1360
01:48:47,333 --> 01:48:49,875
I..

1361
01:48:55,917 --> 01:48:57,167
I will call you papa.

1362
01:49:00,250 --> 01:49:01,875
I will call you papa.

1363
01:49:10,792 --> 01:49:12,167
You finally gave me your blessings.

1364
01:49:13,250 --> 01:49:15,917
You're so strange,
Prajapati Pandey.

1365
01:49:18,917 --> 01:49:20,792
Hey, look there.

1366
01:49:27,625 --> 01:49:31,500
I will give you good reward.

1367
01:49:32,042 --> 01:49:34,042
Your mother's last remembrance.

1368
01:49:35,250 --> 01:49:36,750
Her inhaler.

1369
01:49:43,167 --> 01:49:44,917
How did you get hold of this?

1370
01:49:45,625 --> 01:49:46,958
Catch him.

1371
01:49:52,792 --> 01:49:53,875
'Who are you?
- Hello, Aunt.'

1372
01:49:53,958 --> 01:49:55,042
'What do you want? '

1373
01:49:55,167 --> 01:49:56,958
'Bless me.
- Bless you.'

1374
01:49:57,500 --> 01:50:02,167
'Is Chulbul Pandey your son?
- Yes.'

1375
01:50:06,083 --> 01:50:07,208
'Where is my money? '

1376
01:50:08,167 --> 01:50:09,250
'Tell me.'

1377
01:50:09,500 --> 01:50:10,625
'Return my money.'

1378
01:50:10,792 --> 01:50:12,375
'Return my money.'

1379
01:50:12,500 --> 01:50:14,375
'Return my money or else.. '

1380
01:50:15,333 --> 01:50:17,333
'Return my money.'

1381
01:50:17,792 --> 01:50:21,750
'Return my money or
else I won't spare you.'

1382
01:50:23,625 --> 01:50:25,042
What are you looking for?

1383
01:50:26,750 --> 01:50:29,250
'Keep this aside, what
will you do with it.'

1384
01:50:29,625 --> 01:50:31,042
'Chulbul Pandey is wanted.'

1385
01:50:31,250 --> 01:50:32,792
'Just return my money.'

1386
01:50:35,958 --> 01:50:37,958
'Why are you doing
like this, mother?'

1387
01:50:41,917 --> 01:50:45,167
'Just return my money and
I will return you this.'

1388
01:50:48,250 --> 01:50:50,167
'What happened?'

1389
01:50:51,917 --> 01:50:53,792
'Chedi Singh's last salutations.'

1390
01:50:54,375 --> 01:50:56,042
Glory to you!

1391
01:50:56,500 --> 01:50:59,958
'Arrange everything back
to normal here. - Yes.'

1392
01:51:00,083 --> 01:51:01,917
'I don't want a police case.'

1393
01:51:04,208 --> 01:51:06,125
'And I'll keep this safe.'

1394
01:51:06,250 --> 01:51:07,750
My puff.

1395
01:51:08,125 --> 01:51:10,208
I didn'tjust kill your mother.

1396
01:51:11,083 --> 01:51:12,792
I also set your father ablaze.

1397
01:51:14,500 --> 01:51:16,375
You've already killed your brother.

1398
01:51:16,667 --> 01:51:19,042
Why do you want to live any longer?

1399
01:51:19,792 --> 01:51:21,917
Hello.
- Give the phone to Chedi.

1400
01:51:22,042 --> 01:51:25,667
Go join your family.

1401
01:51:25,792 --> 01:51:26,917
I.G.

1402
01:51:28,375 --> 01:51:29,500
Yes, friend.

1403
01:51:29,667 --> 01:51:30,917
Tell me.
- Brother, Chulbul Pandey is alive.

1404
01:51:31,208 --> 01:51:33,917
I saw him with my own eyes.
He's coming to you with full army.

1405
01:51:34,042 --> 01:51:35,500
What nonsense?

1406
01:51:35,500 --> 01:51:38,125
This is a foolproof news,
brother. Be careful.

1407
01:51:38,792 --> 01:51:40,667
Did you kill your brother?

1408
01:52:36,500 --> 01:52:37,625
Come on.

1409
01:53:29,667 --> 01:53:31,667
No!

1410
01:53:32,667 --> 01:53:35,000
No! No! No! No!

1411
01:53:35,000 --> 01:53:37,000
That's Makkhi. No! No!

1412
01:53:55,917 --> 01:53:57,708
Who asked you to bring this here?

1413
01:54:02,958 --> 01:54:04,000
Brother.

1414
01:54:44,667 --> 01:54:46,000
Scoundrel.

1415
01:54:47,250 --> 01:54:48,375
Douse the fire.

1416
01:54:49,000 --> 01:54:50,500
Take the box.

1417
01:55:42,958 --> 01:55:44,125
Makkhi.

1418
01:56:04,250 --> 01:56:07,667
My parents sacrificed 101 rascals..

1419
01:56:07,833 --> 01:56:11,708
..and then I was born,
Chulbul Pandey.

1420
01:56:13,417 --> 01:56:15,417
I'm the God of those rascals.

1421
01:56:17,125 --> 01:56:18,250
I'm here to take revenge.

1422
01:58:08,125 --> 01:58:09,292
Get up!

1423
01:58:09,417 --> 01:58:10,542
Get up!

1424
01:58:11,417 --> 01:58:14,542
You've hurt me a lot,
Chulbul Pandey.

1425
01:58:15,667 --> 01:58:17,833
You call yourself the
God of rascals, don't you?

1426
01:58:37,542 --> 01:58:39,250
Brother. Brother.

1427
01:58:42,875 --> 01:58:44,000
Brother.

1428
01:58:44,125 --> 01:58:46,542
For the first time I
am happy to see you.

1429
01:58:59,125 --> 01:59:00,542
'Give it to me.
- He gave her a terrible death.'

1430
01:59:00,750 --> 01:59:02,292
'He gave her a terrible death.'

1431
01:59:03,292 --> 01:59:04,750
He gave her a terrible death.'

1432
01:59:10,875 --> 01:59:12,667
'With my money?'

1433
01:59:18,000 --> 01:59:20,000
'Give me the money or I'll hit you.'

1434
01:59:20,125 --> 01:59:21,750
'Give me my money.'

1435
02:01:25,125 --> 02:01:27,750
Seeing this tractor
I remembered that..

1436
02:01:27,875 --> 02:01:31,167
..I've to get you
married to master's daughter.

1437
02:01:49,500 --> 02:01:51,000
He's getting sentimental?

1438
02:01:51,292 --> 02:01:54,875
Papa, why are your eyes wet?

1439
02:01:55,625 --> 02:01:58,042
You're strange, Mr. Pandey.

1440
02:01:59,000 --> 02:02:01,750
You got this dimwit married.

1441
02:02:02,125 --> 02:02:03,750
That's exactly what I wanted.

1442
02:02:04,042 --> 02:02:05,458
Happy ending.

1443
02:02:05,625 --> 02:02:07,500
It's not the ending, father.

1444
02:02:07,875 --> 02:02:09,750
It's just the beginning.

1445
02:02:10,292 --> 02:02:13,625
I wish your mother was present.

1446
02:02:15,458 --> 02:02:17,875
On that note I remembered,
Robin Hood Pandey.

1447
02:02:18,625 --> 02:02:20,208
I'm pregnant.

1448
02:02:20,625 --> 02:02:22,167
Better mend your ways.

1449
02:02:23,583 --> 02:02:25,500
Quiet.
- You quiet.

1450
02:02:25,625 --> 02:02:28,500
Sir.
- Chedi Singh is dead.

1451
02:02:28,625 --> 02:02:30,500
But his money.

1452
02:02:32,292 --> 02:02:33,750
Have it disappeared.

1453
02:02:34,167 --> 02:02:36,167
He also has a brother.
What if tries to take revenge?

1454
02:02:38,417 --> 02:02:40,875
Then I'll fill him
with so many holes..

1455
02:02:41,042 --> 02:02:45,625
..that he'll be confused
where to breathe from and..

1456
02:03:17,750 --> 02:03:20,750
''Fearless.''

1457
02:03:20,875 --> 02:03:23,750
