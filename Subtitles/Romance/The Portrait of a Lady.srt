1
00:00:13,546 --> 00:00:16,506
(Woman) 'The best part of a kiss,
I think,'

2
00:00:16,507 --> 00:00:19,384
'is when you see that head
coming towards you'

3
00:00:19,552 --> 00:00:22,554
'and you know
that you're going to get kissed.'

4
00:00:22,555 --> 00:00:26,391
'That moment just before
is so exquisite.'

5
00:00:26,392 --> 00:00:30,229
(Second woman ) 'I'd never felt
the touch of another person my age.'

6
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:32,356
'The sensation flew through me.'

7
00:00:32,357 --> 00:00:35,234
(Third woman ) 'I love it.
I love kissing.'

8
00:00:35,235 --> 00:00:40,030
(Fourth woman ) 'We were addicted to
that being entwined with each other,'

9
00:00:40,031 --> 00:00:44,201
'whether it was really positive
or negative.'

10
00:00:44,202 --> 00:00:48,664
(Fifth woman ) 'I get this intense
look that says "I'm so mysterious,'

11
00:00:48,665 --> 00:00:52,793
"'and there's so much more to me
than meets the eye to find out..."'

12
00:00:52,794 --> 00:00:53,877
(Giggling)

13
00:00:53,878 --> 00:00:56,129
(Sixth woman ) 'I believe in fate,'

14
00:00:56,130 --> 00:00:59,925
'so that person will find me,
or we'll find each other somehow.'

15
00:00:59,926 --> 00:01:04,471
(Seventh woman ) 'It means finding
a mirror, the clearest mirror'

16
00:01:04,639 --> 00:01:07,182
'and the most loyal mirror,'

17
00:01:07,183 --> 00:01:11,979
'so when I love that person, I know
that they'll shine that back to me.'

18
00:03:23,319 --> 00:03:25,862
There's one thing more, Miss Archer.

19
00:03:25,863 --> 00:03:29,950
You know,
if you don't like Lockleigh,

20
00:03:29,951 --> 00:03:33,578
if you think it's too damp
or anything of that sort,

21
00:03:33,579 --> 00:03:36,790
you need never go
within 50 miles of it.

22
00:03:36,791 --> 00:03:40,794
It's not damp, by the way. I've had
the house thoroughly examined,

23
00:03:40,795 --> 00:03:44,798
and it's perfectly safe,
but if you shouldn't fancy it,

24
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:47,134
you needn't dream of living in it.

25
00:03:47,135 --> 00:03:49,386
There's no difficulty about that.

26
00:03:49,554 --> 00:03:51,763
I've plenty of houses.

27
00:03:53,516 --> 00:03:55,600
I thought to let you know.

28
00:03:57,478 --> 00:04:00,063
Some people don't like a moat,
you know.

29
00:04:01,441 --> 00:04:03,567
I adore a moat.

30
00:04:07,864 --> 00:04:09,865
I'm very sure you know...

31
00:04:11,826 --> 00:04:14,786
I don't go off easily...

32
00:04:14,787 --> 00:04:18,999
but when I'm touched,
it's for life, Miss Archer.

33
00:04:20,168 --> 00:04:22,377
It's for life.

34
00:04:30,178 --> 00:04:32,012
(Dogs bark)

35
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:34,598
Look, here comes Miss Archer.

36
00:04:37,435 --> 00:04:40,604
(Woman) No... She's going up
to the house.

37
00:04:40,605 --> 00:04:44,608
(Second woman ) So she is.
Where is Lord Warburton?

38
00:04:44,609 --> 00:04:46,818
He was with her.

39
00:04:46,819 --> 00:04:49,654
Bunchie, go back. Back.

40
00:04:55,995 --> 00:04:57,829
(Whispering)

41
00:05:28,694 --> 00:05:31,071
Shall I sit with you
until dinner, Daddy?

42
00:05:31,072 --> 00:05:34,908
I would like that, but Isabel
has asked to talk with me.

43
00:05:34,909 --> 00:05:36,034
(Knock on door)

44
00:05:36,035 --> 00:05:38,787
Come in, my dear.

45
00:05:42,959 --> 00:05:45,210
Do sit down. Hmm?

46
00:05:46,295 --> 00:05:47,254
(Coughs )

47
00:05:49,590 --> 00:05:50,757
Ahem.

48
00:06:00,351 --> 00:06:01,977
Uncle, I...

49
00:06:04,272 --> 00:06:06,606
I ought to let you know that...

50
00:06:06,607 --> 00:06:10,068
Lord Warburton has asked me
to marry him.

51
00:06:10,069 --> 00:06:11,736
Well!

52
00:06:11,737 --> 00:06:15,115
I told you you'd be
a success over here.

53
00:06:15,116 --> 00:06:17,701
Americans are highly appreciated...

54
00:06:17,702 --> 00:06:20,161
and you're very beautiful, you know.

55
00:06:20,162 --> 00:06:22,539
Oh, yes, of course. I'm lovely.

56
00:06:26,669 --> 00:06:27,836
I...

57
00:06:29,547 --> 00:06:34,175
I know it seems tasteless
and ungrateful...

58
00:06:36,596 --> 00:06:39,139
but I can't marry him.

59
00:06:40,308 --> 00:06:44,311
You didn't find his proposal
sufficiently attractive?

60
00:06:44,312 --> 00:06:46,187
It was attractive.

61
00:06:46,188 --> 00:06:52,110
There was a moment when I would have
given my little finger to say yes,

62
00:06:52,111 --> 00:06:54,779
but...

63
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:59,075
I think I have to begin by getting
a general impression of life.

64
00:06:59,076 --> 00:07:01,077
Do you see?

65
00:07:02,496 --> 00:07:05,081
And there's a light that has to dawn.

66
00:07:08,294 --> 00:07:10,712
I can't explain it, but...

67
00:07:10,713 --> 00:07:12,797
I know it's there.

68
00:07:16,510 --> 00:07:19,471
I'm not afraid, you know.

69
00:07:19,639 --> 00:07:21,806
He's a very fine man.

70
00:07:21,974 --> 00:07:24,726
He earns 100,000 a year...

71
00:07:24,727 --> 00:07:27,896
about half a dozen houses
to live in...

72
00:07:27,897 --> 00:07:32,525
and a seat in Parliament
as I have one at my own dinner table.

73
00:07:32,526 --> 00:07:34,486
Well...

74
00:07:34,487 --> 00:07:37,781
I hope very much
I have no more offers.

75
00:07:37,782 --> 00:07:39,866
They upset me completely.

76
00:07:41,285 --> 00:07:44,079
Isabel, your uncle is quite right.

77
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:47,916
You certainly cannot go to London
without a proper escort.

78
00:07:47,917 --> 00:07:50,710
Well, my friend Henrietta
will be with me.

79
00:07:50,711 --> 00:07:53,546
Your friend sounds rather bohemian,

80
00:07:53,547 --> 00:07:56,424
and no doubt she will want to stay
at a boarding house.

81
00:07:56,425 --> 00:08:00,053
Ralph has put you down at his club.

82
00:08:00,221 --> 00:08:02,055
With Ralph, you can go anywhere.

83
00:08:02,223 --> 00:08:04,391
Isn't anything proper here?

84
00:08:04,558 --> 00:08:07,477
You're too fond
of your own ways, miss.

85
00:08:07,478 --> 00:08:09,479
Yes, I'm very fond of them.

86
00:08:10,815 --> 00:08:15,276
Isabel, I do not expect you
to always heed my advice.

87
00:08:15,277 --> 00:08:18,321
But as you have
neither mother nor father,

88
00:08:18,322 --> 00:08:21,825
I do expect you to listen to it.

89
00:08:35,339 --> 00:08:37,048
(Driver) Hup, hup, hup.

90
00:08:37,049 --> 00:08:40,593
(Ralph ) Shall I love
your reporter friend or hate her?

91
00:08:40,761 --> 00:08:43,638
Whichever you do will matter
little to Henrietta.

92
00:08:43,806 --> 00:08:46,975
She doesn't care a straw
what men think of her.

93
00:08:46,976 --> 00:08:51,020
- will she interview me?
- You're not important enough.

94
00:08:53,149 --> 00:08:54,941
Henrietta!

95
00:09:07,663 --> 00:09:11,416
- So sad.
- Morbid, isn't it?

96
00:09:13,878 --> 00:09:15,295
(Whistle )

97
00:09:19,258 --> 00:09:21,509
When I wrote to you from Liverpool,

98
00:09:21,677 --> 00:09:24,888
I said I had something
in particular to tell you.

99
00:09:26,766 --> 00:09:29,184
You haven't asked me what it is yet.

100
00:09:30,561 --> 00:09:32,937
Is it because you suspected?

101
00:09:32,938 --> 00:09:35,440
Mmm... Suspected what?

102
00:09:35,441 --> 00:09:37,442
What have you to tell me?

103
00:09:37,443 --> 00:09:41,529
What I have to tell you
is about your American admirer.

104
00:09:41,530 --> 00:09:46,117
Mr. Goodwood has come over
on the steamer with me.

105
00:09:46,118 --> 00:09:48,328
Oh!

106
00:09:48,329 --> 00:09:50,330
You say that right.

107
00:09:51,373 --> 00:09:53,374
He's come after you.

108
00:09:54,168 --> 00:09:56,336
Did he tell you so?

109
00:09:56,337 --> 00:09:57,629
No.

110
00:09:57,630 --> 00:09:59,839
He told me... nothing.

111
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:03,718
- But I spoke of you a great deal.
- I'm sorry you did that.

112
00:10:03,886 --> 00:10:07,514
Oh, no. It was a pleasure to me.
I like the way he listened.

113
00:10:10,684 --> 00:10:13,436
He was so quiet,

114
00:10:13,437 --> 00:10:15,188
so intense.

115
00:10:15,189 --> 00:10:16,981
He drank it all in.

116
00:10:16,982 --> 00:10:19,275
He thinks too well of me already.

117
00:10:19,276 --> 00:10:21,402
He oughtn't be encouraged.

118
00:10:21,403 --> 00:10:24,197
He's dying
for a little encouragement.

119
00:10:24,198 --> 00:10:25,865
Shh!

120
00:10:28,577 --> 00:10:31,246
I can see his face now.

121
00:10:31,247 --> 00:10:33,832
And his look while we talked.

122
00:10:35,084 --> 00:10:38,586
I... I've never seen an ugly man
look so handsome.

123
00:10:40,923 --> 00:10:43,591
He's very simple-minded...

124
00:10:43,592 --> 00:10:45,593
and he's not so ugly.

125
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:50,723
Does your cousin go around all day
with his hands in his pockets?

126
00:10:50,891 --> 00:10:53,059
What does he do for a living?

127
00:10:53,227 --> 00:10:56,271
He's terribly ill.
He's quite unfit for work.

128
00:10:56,272 --> 00:10:58,231
Don't you believe it.

129
00:10:58,232 --> 00:11:00,275
I work when I'm sick.

130
00:11:02,486 --> 00:11:05,405
I should like to show him up.
He'd make a beautiful specimen.

131
00:11:10,744 --> 00:11:14,330
(Ralph ) Daddy and I lived here
when he worked at the bank.

132
00:11:14,331 --> 00:11:16,332
We don't use it now.

133
00:11:18,002 --> 00:11:21,588
(Isabel) I love this time of day,
just as it gets dark.

134
00:11:23,173 --> 00:11:25,174
Don't you?

135
00:11:25,885 --> 00:11:27,802
- Ralph?
- Huh?

136
00:11:32,516 --> 00:11:37,061
- May I light a cigarette?
- You may do what you please,

137
00:11:37,229 --> 00:11:39,397
as long as you'll amuse me.

138
00:11:40,608 --> 00:11:42,191
(Ralph clears throat)

139
00:11:45,362 --> 00:11:48,740
What had you in mind
when you refused Warburton?

140
00:11:50,409 --> 00:11:53,620
I have his leave to let you know
he has told me.

141
00:11:54,788 --> 00:11:56,039
Did...?

142
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:58,625
Did he ask you to talk to me?

143
00:11:58,626 --> 00:12:01,544
No, not that. He...

144
00:12:01,545 --> 00:12:04,172
told me because
he couldn't help it.

145
00:12:04,173 --> 00:12:07,675
We're old friends,
and he was very heavy-hearted.

146
00:12:10,471 --> 00:12:13,514
What had I in mind
when I refused him?

147
00:12:16,143 --> 00:12:18,937
What logic dictated
so remarkable an act?

148
00:12:18,938 --> 00:12:21,314
Why do you call it remarkable?

149
00:12:21,482 --> 00:12:24,609
As a man, Warburton
is hardly at fault.

150
00:12:24,777 --> 00:12:27,987
I refused him because
he was too perfect, then.

151
00:12:32,618 --> 00:12:37,497
If you've really given Warburton
his final answer, I'm rather glad.

152
00:12:37,498 --> 00:12:41,668
I don't mean I'm glad for you,
and still less, of course, for him.

153
00:12:41,669 --> 00:12:43,670
I'm glad for myself.

154
00:12:48,717 --> 00:12:51,135
Are you thinking of proposing to me?

155
00:12:53,138 --> 00:12:56,975
What I mean
is that I shall have the thrill

156
00:12:56,976 --> 00:13:02,063
of seeing what a young lady does
who won't marry Lord Warburton.

157
00:13:05,776 --> 00:13:07,777
You asked about logic.

158
00:13:08,821 --> 00:13:10,822
I'll tell you.

159
00:13:12,366 --> 00:13:15,493
- It's that I can't escape my fate.
- Your fate?

160
00:13:18,706 --> 00:13:20,873
It's not my fate to give up.

161
00:13:20,874 --> 00:13:23,793
You call marrying Lord Warburton
giving up?

162
00:13:23,794 --> 00:13:27,588
It's getting a great deal,
but it's giving up other chances.

163
00:13:27,589 --> 00:13:29,549
Chances for what?

164
00:13:30,884 --> 00:13:34,137
I don't mean chances to marry.
I mean...

165
00:13:35,931 --> 00:13:37,807
from life...

166
00:13:39,059 --> 00:13:41,978
from the usual chances and dangers.

167
00:13:46,525 --> 00:13:48,985
You've answered my question.

168
00:13:48,986 --> 00:13:51,863
It seems to me
I've told you very little.

169
00:13:51,864 --> 00:13:54,073
You've told me the great thing.

170
00:13:54,074 --> 00:13:57,869
The world interests you.
You want to throw yourself into it.

171
00:13:57,870 --> 00:14:02,707
- I never said that.
- You meant it. Don't repudiate it.

172
00:14:02,708 --> 00:14:04,709
It's so fine.

173
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:11,924
(Crowd cheering)

174
00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:21,017
(Barker) There he is,
the Great Santini.

175
00:14:21,018 --> 00:14:23,853
(Man ) Go on. Pull!

176
00:14:24,021 --> 00:14:26,481
Pull! Pull!

177
00:14:26,648 --> 00:14:28,649
(Santini roars )

178
00:14:53,592 --> 00:14:56,302
How did you know I was here?

179
00:14:56,303 --> 00:14:58,471
Miss Stackpole let me know.

180
00:15:01,308 --> 00:15:03,518
That is not kind of her.

181
00:15:05,312 --> 00:15:09,232
You said you hoped never to hear
from me again. I know that.

182
00:15:09,399 --> 00:15:12,110
But I never accepted
any such rule as my own.

183
00:15:12,111 --> 00:15:14,612
I didn't say I hoped
never to hear from you.

184
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:18,407
Not for five years, then.
Ten, twenty, it's the same thing.

185
00:15:19,576 --> 00:15:22,662
What good do you expect
to get by insisting?

186
00:15:24,832 --> 00:15:27,125
I disgust you very much.

187
00:15:27,126 --> 00:15:28,709
Yes.

188
00:15:29,670 --> 00:15:32,588
You don't at all delight me.

189
00:15:32,589 --> 00:15:36,217
You don't fit in,
not in any way. Not now.

190
00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:41,222
Think of me or not.
Only leave me alone.

191
00:15:42,349 --> 00:15:44,350
Until when?

192
00:15:46,395 --> 00:15:48,813
For a year... or two.

193
00:15:50,607 --> 00:15:53,442
Well, which?
Between one year and two,

194
00:15:53,443 --> 00:15:56,279
there's all the difference
in the world.

195
00:15:57,573 --> 00:15:59,532
Call it two, then.

196
00:16:02,828 --> 00:16:06,372
You'll marry someone else
as sure as I stand here.

197
00:16:06,373 --> 00:16:09,292
I don't wish to be
a mere sheep in the flock.

198
00:16:09,293 --> 00:16:11,419
I shall probably never marry.

199
00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:12,753
(God.)

200
00:16:12,754 --> 00:16:16,883
If you hear it rumoured I'm near
marrying, remember what I've said...

201
00:16:18,218 --> 00:16:20,219
and doubt it.

202
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:25,808
I hate to lose sight of you.

203
00:16:35,235 --> 00:16:36,903
Goodbye.

204
00:17:02,471 --> 00:17:03,930
Hmm.

205
00:17:11,021 --> 00:17:12,355
(Sighs )

206
00:18:43,864 --> 00:18:45,865
(Ralph ) I love you.

207
00:19:24,821 --> 00:19:27,156
You acted very wrongly.

208
00:19:27,324 --> 00:19:30,743
You don't mean to tell me
you've sent him off?

209
00:19:30,744 --> 00:19:33,913
I asked him to leave me alone,

210
00:19:33,914 --> 00:19:36,999
and I ask you the same, Henrietta.

211
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,293
If you marry one of these people,

212
00:19:39,294 --> 00:19:42,505
I'll never speak to you again.

213
00:19:42,506 --> 00:19:44,715
You better wait till I'm asked.

214
00:19:44,716 --> 00:19:48,094
Oh, you'll be asked quick enough.

215
00:19:48,095 --> 00:19:52,056
Annie Climber was asked
three times in Italy.

216
00:19:52,057 --> 00:19:54,558
Poor, plain, little Annie.

217
00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:59,063
Well, if Annie Climber
wasn't captured, why should I be?

218
00:19:59,064 --> 00:20:02,983
Well, I don't believe
Annie was pressed, but you'll be.

219
00:20:06,446 --> 00:20:09,657
Do you know where you're going,
Isabel Archer?

220
00:20:09,825 --> 00:20:11,992
No, and it's very pleasant not to.

221
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:15,162
You're drifting off
to some great mistake.

222
00:20:15,163 --> 00:20:17,164
You make me shudder.

223
00:20:18,458 --> 00:20:20,501
(Man coughing)

224
00:20:25,173 --> 00:20:28,300
My father's had an attack
of his old malady.

225
00:20:28,301 --> 00:20:31,220
It's quite severe,
I'm afraid. (Coughs )

226
00:20:32,973 --> 00:20:36,267
By great good luck,
Dr. Matthew Hope is in town,

227
00:20:36,268 --> 00:20:39,937
and I shall make sure of
his coming down to Gardencourt.

228
00:20:41,106 --> 00:20:43,899
There's... an express train at 2.45,

229
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:47,069
and you shall come with me or not,
as you prefer.

230
00:20:47,070 --> 00:20:50,364
I shall go with you. I'll pack now.

231
00:20:54,161 --> 00:20:56,162
(Sighs )

232
00:20:58,039 --> 00:21:00,166
I'm not at peace about Isabel.

233
00:21:00,167 --> 00:21:04,753
I fear she may marry one of these
Europeans, and I want to prevent it.

234
00:21:06,923 --> 00:21:10,050
What a rage you have
for organising people.

235
00:21:10,051 --> 00:21:12,970
I simply want her to marry
Mr. Caspar Goodwood.

236
00:21:12,971 --> 00:21:15,931
He's followed her
all the way from Boston.

237
00:21:17,267 --> 00:21:20,186
He was here, last night.

238
00:21:20,187 --> 00:21:22,271
- (Dishes shatter)
- In Pratt's?

239
00:21:22,272 --> 00:21:26,150
Mmm. It was a little plot of mine.

240
00:21:27,861 --> 00:21:29,862
Is she very fond of him?

241
00:21:29,863 --> 00:21:32,198
If she isn't, she ought to be.

242
00:21:32,199 --> 00:21:34,492
He's simply wrapped up in her.

243
00:21:34,659 --> 00:21:40,039
Three months ago, she gave him every
reason to suspect he was acceptable,

244
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:43,876
and it's not really of Isabel
to go back on a friend

245
00:21:43,877 --> 00:21:47,338
simply because
she's changed the scene.

246
00:21:47,339 --> 00:21:51,592
(Tapping glass ) Isabel... was cruel?

247
00:21:51,593 --> 00:21:53,761
She gave him no satisfaction.

248
00:21:53,762 --> 00:21:56,430
Her only idea was to be rid of him.

249
00:21:59,643 --> 00:22:01,560
(Ralph ) Poor Mr. Goodwood.

250
00:22:05,190 --> 00:22:07,191
(Barking)

251
00:22:15,408 --> 00:22:17,368
(Glasses clinking)

252
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:39,682
Sir Matthew, he had some kind
of seizure last night,

253
00:22:39,683 --> 00:22:42,309
but I feel a dreadful
cold coming on.

254
00:22:42,310 --> 00:22:45,104
- You will leave me a powder?
- Of course.

255
00:22:47,148 --> 00:22:50,276
Oh, my great friend from Rome
has arrived.

256
00:22:50,277 --> 00:22:52,486
You will stay for tea?

257
00:22:56,783 --> 00:22:58,742
(Muffled piano playing)

258
00:23:35,363 --> 00:23:37,990
(Piano playing continues behind door)

259
00:24:48,269 --> 00:24:51,021
It's very beautiful,

260
00:24:51,022 --> 00:24:55,484
and your playing makes it
more beautiful still.

261
00:24:55,485 --> 00:24:58,696
You don't think I disturbed
Mr. Touchett, then?

262
00:24:58,697 --> 00:25:02,491
His room is so far away,
and I play just...

263
00:25:02,659 --> 00:25:04,660
just un peu des doigts.

264
00:25:06,579 --> 00:25:10,124
No, I... I should think
that to hear such lovely music

265
00:25:10,291 --> 00:25:12,710
would make him feel better.

266
00:25:12,711 --> 00:25:15,254
I'm afraid there are moments in life

267
00:25:15,255 --> 00:25:18,382
when even Schubert
has nothing to say to us.

268
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:30,436
Would... would you
play something more?

269
00:25:31,604 --> 00:25:35,232
If it will
give you pleasure, delighted.

270
00:25:37,902 --> 00:25:39,695
(Starts playing)

271
00:25:40,864 --> 00:25:44,658
(Stops playing) Are you the niece,
the young American?

272
00:25:44,826 --> 00:25:49,580
- I'm my aunt's niece.
- C'est bon. we're compatriots.

273
00:25:49,748 --> 00:25:51,749
I'm Madame Merle.

274
00:25:55,170 --> 00:25:57,171
(Starts playing)

275
00:26:26,117 --> 00:26:28,035
(Dog panting)

276
00:26:30,497 --> 00:26:32,498
(Snores lightly )

277
00:26:36,669 --> 00:26:38,420
Mmm.

278
00:26:46,846 --> 00:26:48,639
(Door closes )

279
00:26:54,938 --> 00:26:57,272
Who's that with me?

280
00:26:57,273 --> 00:26:59,274
Is it my son?

281
00:27:00,109 --> 00:27:02,110
Yes, it's your son, Daddy.

282
00:27:03,279 --> 00:27:06,198
- Is there no one else?
- No one else.

283
00:27:06,199 --> 00:27:07,950
Cigarette.

284
00:27:20,755 --> 00:27:23,423
What you should do when I'm gone

285
00:27:23,424 --> 00:27:25,425
is to marry.

286
00:27:27,178 --> 00:27:29,388
What do you think of your cousin?

287
00:27:33,893 --> 00:27:38,981
Do I... do I understand you to propose
that I should marry Isabel?

288
00:27:38,982 --> 00:27:42,651
Well, that's what
it comes to in the end.

289
00:27:42,652 --> 00:27:44,778
Don't you like Isabel?

290
00:27:46,155 --> 00:27:48,949
Yes, very much.
I like Isabel very much.

291
00:27:49,117 --> 00:27:52,578
- I've thought a great deal about it.
- So have I.

292
00:27:52,745 --> 00:27:54,872
I don't mind telling you that.

293
00:27:54,873 --> 00:27:56,999
You're in love with her, then?

294
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:01,336
I should think you would be.
It's as if she came over on purpose.

295
00:28:07,594 --> 00:28:10,512
No, I'm not in love with her, but...

296
00:28:11,681 --> 00:28:15,893
I should be, if...
certain things were different.

297
00:28:16,477 --> 00:28:20,147
Things are always different
from what they might be.

298
00:28:22,775 --> 00:28:24,860
I shall not live many years...

299
00:28:26,029 --> 00:28:29,448
but I hope long enough to see
what Isabel does with herself.

300
00:28:29,616 --> 00:28:32,868
I should like
to do something for her.

301
00:28:32,869 --> 00:28:36,246
- I should like to make her rich.
- what do you mean by rich?

302
00:28:36,414 --> 00:28:38,540
I call people rich

303
00:28:38,541 --> 00:28:42,669
when they're able to meet the
requirements of their imagination.

304
00:28:42,670 --> 00:28:44,796
To do what she likes with it?

305
00:28:44,797 --> 00:28:46,924
Absolutely what she likes.

306
00:28:48,343 --> 00:28:50,969
Good boy.

307
00:28:50,970 --> 00:28:52,930
You win.

308
00:28:54,057 --> 00:28:55,849
Down.

309
00:29:00,063 --> 00:29:02,147
Who is this Madame Merle?

310
00:29:03,274 --> 00:29:05,651
She's very charming.

311
00:29:05,652 --> 00:29:08,278
She plays beautifully.

312
00:29:08,279 --> 00:29:12,115
- She does everything beautifully.
- You don't like her.

313
00:29:12,283 --> 00:29:14,826
On the contrary,
I was once in love with her.

314
00:29:14,994 --> 00:29:17,496
And she didn't care for you?

315
00:29:17,664 --> 00:29:19,581
That's why you don't like her?

316
00:29:19,749 --> 00:29:22,542
How can we have
discussed such things?

317
00:29:22,543 --> 00:29:24,836
Monsieur Merle was then living.

318
00:29:24,837 --> 00:29:27,297
Is he dead now?

319
00:29:27,298 --> 00:29:29,174
So she says.

320
00:29:29,175 --> 00:29:31,176
Don't you believe her?

321
00:29:32,512 --> 00:29:35,222
Yes, because...

322
00:29:35,223 --> 00:29:39,184
the husband of Madame Merle
would be likely to pass away.

323
00:29:42,021 --> 00:29:44,147
(Mme Merle ) Am I late?

324
00:29:44,148 --> 00:29:46,441
I do apologise.

325
00:29:46,442 --> 00:29:48,443
No, not at all.

326
00:29:51,447 --> 00:29:54,241
Are you aware of the beautiful
walking paths round the estate?

327
00:29:58,329 --> 00:30:02,416
(Merle ) Americans certainly
make poor Europeans.

328
00:30:03,584 --> 00:30:06,378
We've no natural place here.

329
00:30:06,379 --> 00:30:10,507
But a woman, it seems to me,
has no natural place anywhere.

330
00:30:10,508 --> 00:30:14,511
Wherever she finds herself,
she must stay on the surface,

331
00:30:14,512 --> 00:30:16,638
and more or less crawl.

332
00:30:16,639 --> 00:30:18,140
I shall never crawl.

333
00:30:18,141 --> 00:30:21,268
Yes. On the whole,
I don't see you crawling.

334
00:30:23,021 --> 00:30:26,189
But the men, the Americans?

335
00:30:26,357 --> 00:30:28,358
Look at poor Ralph Touchett.

336
00:30:28,526 --> 00:30:31,069
What sort of figure do you call that?

337
00:30:31,237 --> 00:30:34,406
Fortunately, he has consumption.

338
00:30:34,407 --> 00:30:38,326
I say fortunately because
it gives him something to do.

339
00:30:38,327 --> 00:30:41,288
His consumption's his... carrière.

340
00:30:41,289 --> 00:30:43,665
It's a kind of position.

341
00:30:43,666 --> 00:30:46,376
If he were not ill,
he'd do something.

342
00:30:46,377 --> 00:30:49,337
He'd take his father's
place in the bank.

343
00:30:49,338 --> 00:30:51,965
I doubt it.
He's not at all fond of the bank.

344
00:30:53,092 --> 00:30:56,678
- Are you not good friends?
- Perfectly!

345
00:30:56,679 --> 00:30:58,680
But he doesn't like me.

346
00:30:59,307 --> 00:31:01,099
What have you done to him?

347
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:02,809
Nothing whatever,

348
00:31:02,810 --> 00:31:05,562
but one has no need
of a reason for that.

349
00:31:05,563 --> 00:31:09,858
For not liking you? I think one
has need of a very good reason.

350
00:31:10,485 --> 00:31:12,861
(Merle ) Ah. I love the English rain.

351
00:31:12,862 --> 00:31:16,948
There's always a little of it
and never too much at once.

352
00:31:16,949 --> 00:31:19,701
And it always... smells good.

353
00:31:20,787 --> 00:31:22,871
(Sniffs ) Ah, delicious!

354
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:26,666
Mmm, delicious!

355
00:31:28,336 --> 00:31:30,337
Mmm, it is!

356
00:31:46,687 --> 00:31:49,439
I'd give a good deal
to be your age again,

357
00:31:49,607 --> 00:31:52,150
to have my life before me.

358
00:31:52,860 --> 00:31:55,028
Your life's before you yet.

359
00:31:56,030 --> 00:31:59,699
No. The best part's gone,
and gone for nothing.

360
00:31:59,867 --> 00:32:01,827
Oh, surely not for nothing.

361
00:32:01,828 --> 00:32:04,996
Why not? What have I got?

362
00:32:04,997 --> 00:32:10,293
Neither husband
nor child nor fortune.

363
00:32:11,629 --> 00:32:13,630
Nor even a house of my own.

364
00:32:14,257 --> 00:32:17,884
What should you like to
do that you've not done?

365
00:32:23,224 --> 00:32:25,600
I'm very ambitious.

366
00:32:25,601 --> 00:32:29,646
To me,
you're the vivid image of success.

367
00:32:33,317 --> 00:32:38,488
My dreams were so... great.

368
00:32:42,910 --> 00:32:47,706
I should make myself ridiculous
by talking of them.

369
00:32:50,209 --> 00:32:52,752
I should like you to have this.

370
00:32:52,753 --> 00:32:55,547
I am going to six places
in succession,

371
00:32:55,548 --> 00:32:58,967
and I shall meet no one
I like so well as you.

372
00:33:16,527 --> 00:33:17,861
Ahem.

373
00:34:15,503 --> 00:34:20,340
He has left me this house, but
naturally, I shall not live in it.

374
00:34:21,217 --> 00:34:25,345
I have a much better one
in Florence, as you know.

375
00:34:25,346 --> 00:34:28,765
And Ralph gets Gardencourt.

376
00:34:28,766 --> 00:34:34,354
Serena, there is one remarkable
clause in my husband's will.

377
00:34:34,355 --> 00:34:36,398
I'll ring for tea?

378
00:34:37,608 --> 00:34:40,485
He has left my niece a fortune.

379
00:34:41,904 --> 00:34:44,739
- A fortune?
- Mm-hmm.

380
00:34:44,740 --> 00:34:49,703
Isabel steps into
something like £70,000.

381
00:34:55,001 --> 00:34:57,002
The clever creature.

382
00:35:23,237 --> 00:35:25,655
(Man ) She seems to me very genteel.

383
00:35:36,876 --> 00:35:39,627
She's really pretty.

384
00:35:39,628 --> 00:35:44,341
When her mother died, I sent her
to see what you'd make of her.

385
00:35:44,342 --> 00:35:46,384
I had faith, you know.

386
00:35:46,385 --> 00:35:50,472
She's perfect. She has no faults.

387
00:35:50,473 --> 00:35:53,308
We've had her
since she was so small.

388
00:35:53,309 --> 00:35:56,895
- It's not certain you'll lose her.
- Monsieur,

389
00:35:56,896 --> 00:35:59,856
good as she is,
she's not one of us.

390
00:35:59,857 --> 00:36:03,443
She's made for the world.

391
00:36:04,278 --> 00:36:06,363
Nothing's settled yet.

392
00:36:15,664 --> 00:36:18,124
- Buongiorno.
- Buongiorno.

393
00:36:18,125 --> 00:36:20,168
(Speaking Italian )

394
00:36:28,260 --> 00:36:31,554
It's only the colour
that's different, Mama.

395
00:36:31,555 --> 00:36:35,100
There are just as many
in one bunch as in the other.

396
00:36:35,101 --> 00:36:36,476
Grazie.

397
00:36:39,271 --> 00:36:41,314
Is there someone here?

398
00:36:41,482 --> 00:36:44,984
Yes, there is. Someone you may see.

399
00:36:44,985 --> 00:36:48,530
- Madame Merle.
- I've come to welcome you home.

400
00:36:49,824 --> 00:36:51,783
May I not go to the carriage?

401
00:36:51,784 --> 00:36:55,245
It would please me better
if you'd remain with me.

402
00:37:02,795 --> 00:37:05,672
I do hope they see
that you wear gloves.

403
00:37:06,882 --> 00:37:09,426
Little girls usually dislike them.

404
00:37:09,427 --> 00:37:12,512
I used to dislike them,
but I like them now.

405
00:37:12,513 --> 00:37:15,723
I'll make you a present of a dozen.

406
00:37:15,724 --> 00:37:20,186
- And will they be very pretty?
- Not too pretty.

407
00:37:24,650 --> 00:37:27,026
She's going to give me some gloves.

408
00:37:28,529 --> 00:37:32,824
You're very kind to her.
But she has everything she needs.

409
00:37:32,825 --> 00:37:35,368
I'd think
she's had enough of the nuns.

410
00:37:35,369 --> 00:37:38,079
If we're discussing it,
she should leave.

411
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:40,999
Let her stay.
We'll talk of something else.

412
00:37:44,545 --> 00:37:49,007
Go into the garden, mignonne,
and pluck a flower for our friend?

413
00:37:49,008 --> 00:37:51,217
That's just what I want to do.

414
00:37:58,851 --> 00:38:00,768
(Door closes )

415
00:38:06,150 --> 00:38:09,861
There's something I should
like you to do in Florence.

416
00:38:15,951 --> 00:38:18,870
There's a friend of mine
I want you to know.

417
00:38:20,247 --> 00:38:22,165
What good will that do me?

418
00:38:25,753 --> 00:38:27,378
It will amuse you.

419
00:38:27,379 --> 00:38:29,380
(Laughs sarcastically )

420
00:38:31,091 --> 00:38:34,469
Oh, if only I could induce you
to make an effort.

421
00:38:34,470 --> 00:38:37,680
Ah, I knew
something tiresome was coming.

422
00:38:37,681 --> 00:38:42,852
What in the world that's likely to
show up here is worth an effort?

423
00:38:48,192 --> 00:38:50,109
Don't be foolish, Osmond.

424
00:38:52,071 --> 00:38:55,073
The person I came to Florence to see.

425
00:38:56,659 --> 00:38:59,410
She's a niece of Mrs. Touchett.

426
00:39:00,538 --> 00:39:06,000
She's young, 23 years old.
I met her in England six months ago.

427
00:39:07,127 --> 00:39:09,128
I like her immensely.

428
00:39:10,839 --> 00:39:15,343
And I do what I don't
do every day, I...

429
00:39:16,679 --> 00:39:18,805
admire her.

430
00:39:19,390 --> 00:39:21,432
You'll do the same.

431
00:39:22,810 --> 00:39:24,936
Not if I can help it.

432
00:39:24,937 --> 00:39:27,772
You won't be able to help it.

433
00:39:27,940 --> 00:39:31,150
Is she beautiful,
clever, rich, splendid,

434
00:39:31,318 --> 00:39:35,697
universally intelligent,
unprecedentedly virtuous?

435
00:39:35,698 --> 00:39:39,951
It's only on those conditions
that I care to make her acquaintance.

436
00:39:39,952 --> 00:39:43,746
I know plenty of dingy people.
I don't want to know any more.

437
00:39:43,956 --> 00:39:45,957
Miss Archer isn't dingy.

438
00:39:48,210 --> 00:39:50,587
She fills all your requirements.

439
00:39:50,588 --> 00:39:52,338
More or less, of course.

440
00:39:52,339 --> 00:39:56,301
No. Quite literally.

441
00:40:10,983 --> 00:40:13,359
What do you want to do with her?

442
00:40:17,072 --> 00:40:22,118
What you see. Put her in your way.

443
00:40:24,747 --> 00:40:27,999
Isn't she meant
for something better than that?

444
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:31,085
I don't pretend to know
what people are meant for.

445
00:40:31,086 --> 00:40:33,546
I only know what I can do with them.

446
00:40:33,547 --> 00:40:36,174
I'm sorry for Miss Archer.

447
00:40:37,343 --> 00:40:42,221
If that's the beginning of interest
in her, I take note of it.

448
00:40:42,222 --> 00:40:44,223
You're looking very well.

449
00:40:45,726 --> 00:40:49,646
You never look so well
as when you've got an idea.

450
00:40:50,981 --> 00:40:53,358
They're always becoming to you.

451
00:40:58,781 --> 00:41:02,617
I wish very much
you were not so heartless.

452
00:41:02,785 --> 00:41:07,288
It's always been against you,
and it will be against you now.

453
00:41:07,289 --> 00:41:10,166
I'm not so heartless as you think.

454
00:41:11,460 --> 00:41:16,339
Every now and then
something... touches me.

455
00:41:16,340 --> 00:41:19,217
As for instance,
your ambitions for me.

456
00:41:19,218 --> 00:41:23,971
Why would you think Mrs. Touchett's
niece should matter to me when...

457
00:41:23,972 --> 00:41:26,224
..I myself have mattered so little?

458
00:41:26,225 --> 00:41:29,602
That is not what I
meant to say, of course.

459
00:41:30,771 --> 00:41:36,192
When I have known and appreciated
such a woman as you.

460
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:38,820
Isabel Archer is better than I.

461
00:42:07,558 --> 00:42:09,684
Have you seen my latest?

462
00:42:09,685 --> 00:42:13,146
Isn't that one
of last year's sketches?

463
00:42:13,313 --> 00:42:15,106
The one you did in Spain?

464
00:42:15,274 --> 00:42:17,442
I've made improvements since then.

465
00:42:17,609 --> 00:42:19,902
I don't care for your drawings.

466
00:42:19,903 --> 00:42:22,405
They're much better
than other peoples'.

467
00:42:22,406 --> 00:42:26,784
But as the only thing you do,
it's so little.

468
00:42:27,953 --> 00:42:32,415
I should have liked you to do so many
other things. I had my ambitions.

469
00:42:32,416 --> 00:42:36,252
- Things that were impossible.
- Things that were impossible.

470
00:42:43,510 --> 00:42:46,429
Your room, at least, is perfect.

471
00:42:46,430 --> 00:42:49,390
I'm struck with that afresh
whenever I come back here.

472
00:42:50,559 --> 00:42:52,560
You've such adorable taste.

473
00:42:55,898 --> 00:42:57,982
I'm sick of my adorable taste.

474
00:42:59,109 --> 00:43:01,903
You must let Miss Archer
come and see it.

475
00:43:04,364 --> 00:43:09,660
As cicerone of your museum,
you appear to particular advantage.

476
00:43:12,164 --> 00:43:14,165
Did you say she was rich?

477
00:43:17,085 --> 00:43:20,421
There's no doubt whatever
about her fortune.

478
00:43:25,928 --> 00:43:29,138
(Speaking Italian )

479
00:43:29,139 --> 00:43:31,140
(Bell chimes )

480
00:43:46,782 --> 00:43:49,951
Do you think it good for me
to be made so rich?

481
00:43:49,952 --> 00:43:51,953
Henrietta doesn't.

482
00:43:52,871 --> 00:43:56,958
Oh, hang Henrietta.
If you ask me, I'm delighted at it.

483
00:43:56,959 --> 00:44:00,837
Did you know your father intended
to leave me so much money?

484
00:44:00,838 --> 00:44:04,465
What does it matter?
My father was very obstinate.

485
00:44:04,466 --> 00:44:06,801
So you did know?

486
00:44:07,469 --> 00:44:08,928
Yes, he told me.

487
00:44:09,805 --> 00:44:13,307
How did he know I'll make good uses
of a large fortune?

488
00:44:13,308 --> 00:44:15,393
How did he know I'm not weak?

489
00:44:15,394 --> 00:44:19,605
Don't ask yourself so much whether
this or that is good for you.

490
00:44:19,606 --> 00:44:24,235
Live as you like best, and your
character will take care of itself.

491
00:44:24,236 --> 00:44:27,405
I wonder if you know what you say.

492
00:44:27,573 --> 00:44:31,200
If you do,
you take a great responsibility.

493
00:44:33,996 --> 00:44:35,413
(Giggles )

494
00:44:35,831 --> 00:44:37,832
(Bell chimes )

495
00:44:55,267 --> 00:44:59,478
The facade is 16th century,
but the interior is much older.

496
00:44:59,479 --> 00:45:01,689
(Woman speaking Italian )

497
00:45:05,277 --> 00:45:08,529
I must tell you that Osmond
doesn't often invite me.

498
00:45:08,697 --> 00:45:11,532
It was quite my own idea,
coming today.

499
00:45:11,700 --> 00:45:15,828
I like to see new people,
and I'm sure you're very new.

500
00:45:15,829 --> 00:45:17,914
Oh! But don't sit there.

501
00:45:18,081 --> 00:45:21,125
That chair's not what it looks.

502
00:45:21,126 --> 00:45:27,465
There are very good seats here, but
there are also some horrors. Pipi.

503
00:45:27,466 --> 00:45:29,175
(Isabel) I don't see any.

504
00:45:29,176 --> 00:45:32,094
Everything seems to me
beautiful and precious.

505
00:45:32,095 --> 00:45:35,723
Thank you.
I've a few good things.

506
00:45:36,934 --> 00:45:39,518
Indeed, I've nothing very bad.

507
00:45:39,519 --> 00:45:43,147
Poor Osmond with his old curtains
and crucifixes.

508
00:45:43,148 --> 00:45:47,401
Won't you have some tea?
You must be very tired.

509
00:45:47,402 --> 00:45:50,529
No, I'm not tired.
What have I done to tire me?

510
00:45:51,365 --> 00:45:53,324
You'll be tired when you go home

511
00:45:53,492 --> 00:45:56,953
if he shows you all his bibelots

512
00:45:57,120 --> 00:45:59,330
and gives you a lecture on each.

513
00:45:59,331 --> 00:46:01,582
Then I'll have learned something.

514
00:46:01,583 --> 00:46:05,086
Oh, well, for me,
one should like a thing or not,

515
00:46:05,087 --> 00:46:07,797
but one shouldn't try
to reason it out.

516
00:46:07,798 --> 00:46:09,632
Some very good feelings

517
00:46:09,633 --> 00:46:12,468
may have very bad reasons,
don't you know?

518
00:46:12,469 --> 00:46:15,429
It's a lovely day.
Shall we go for a walk?

519
00:46:15,430 --> 00:46:21,602
Oh! And then there are some very bad
feelings that have very good reasons.

520
00:46:21,603 --> 00:46:25,398
This hill of my brother's
is impossible.

521
00:46:25,399 --> 00:46:28,192
It's terrible
to hear one's horses wheeze.

522
00:46:28,193 --> 00:46:30,987
What do you think of my sister?

523
00:46:36,410 --> 00:46:38,911
Don't ask me that, I- I...

524
00:46:39,079 --> 00:46:41,455
I've seen your sister too little.

525
00:46:41,456 --> 00:46:44,625
Yes, it's true,
you've seen her very little,

526
00:46:44,626 --> 00:46:49,588
but I should like to know how she
strikes a fresh, unprejudiced mind.

527
00:46:52,217 --> 00:46:56,721
I sometimes think
we've gotten into a rather bad way,

528
00:46:56,722 --> 00:47:01,600
living here amongst people and things
not our own.

529
00:47:02,769 --> 00:47:08,858
My sister's rather unhappy,
and as she's not of a serious turn,

530
00:47:08,859 --> 00:47:13,320
she doesn't tend to show it
tragically, but comically instead.

531
00:47:16,158 --> 00:47:20,828
Shall I take that painting down?
You'll want more light.

532
00:47:32,591 --> 00:47:37,094
This is one of the first paintings
I bought when I came to Italy.

533
00:47:38,096 --> 00:47:41,182
I've seen the girl but this once,
I like her very much.

534
00:47:41,183 --> 00:47:43,017
So do I.

535
00:47:43,018 --> 00:47:45,728
You have a strange way of showing it.

536
00:47:45,729 --> 00:47:47,229
Do not agitate yourself.

537
00:47:47,230 --> 00:47:51,025
The matter concerns three persons
stronger in purpose than yourself.

538
00:47:51,026 --> 00:47:55,529
Three persons?
You and Osmond, of course.

539
00:47:55,697 --> 00:47:58,491
But is Miss Archer also very strong?

540
00:47:58,492 --> 00:48:01,202
Quite as much so as we.

541
00:48:02,412 --> 00:48:04,955
You're capable of anything,
you and Osmond.

542
00:48:04,956 --> 00:48:06,999
- You're dangerous.
- Better leave us alone, then.

543
00:48:10,420 --> 00:48:15,382
Madame Merle spoke of you having
some plan of going around the world?

544
00:48:16,551 --> 00:48:19,845
I'm rather ashamed of my plans.

545
00:48:19,846 --> 00:48:22,348
I make a new one every day.

546
00:48:22,349 --> 00:48:26,852
I don't think you should be ashamed.
It's the greatest of pleasures.

547
00:48:26,853 --> 00:48:30,564
I made a plan years ago
and I'm acting on it today.

548
00:48:32,067 --> 00:48:34,527
Must have been a very pleasant one.

549
00:48:34,528 --> 00:48:37,988
Mmm, it was. Very simple.

550
00:48:37,989 --> 00:48:41,534
It was to be as quiet as possible.

551
00:48:43,245 --> 00:48:44,995
As quiet?

552
00:48:47,165 --> 00:48:50,459
Not to worry,
not to strive nor struggle.

553
00:48:50,460 --> 00:48:53,546
To content myself with little.

554
00:48:56,550 --> 00:48:59,135
I've spent many years here
on that plan,

555
00:48:59,136 --> 00:49:02,263
and been not at all unhappy.

556
00:49:07,727 --> 00:49:10,396
It polishes me up a bit
to talk to you.

557
00:49:13,316 --> 00:49:17,736
But you'll be gone
before I see you three times.

558
00:49:17,737 --> 00:49:21,740
That's what it is to live
in a country that people come to.

559
00:49:23,160 --> 00:49:27,288
Have you had the opportunity
to wander in Florence at all?

560
00:49:27,289 --> 00:49:29,790
(Speaking Italian )

561
00:49:31,501 --> 00:49:34,879
Serena, you know everything.

562
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:38,507
Is that curious creature
making love to my niece?

563
00:49:41,011 --> 00:49:43,012
Gilbert Osmond?

564
00:49:44,514 --> 00:49:46,724
Heaven help us, that's an idea.

565
00:49:47,392 --> 00:49:50,144
It hadn't occurred to you? Hmm?

566
00:49:50,145 --> 00:49:53,981
He's called five times
in the course of a fortnight.

567
00:49:55,692 --> 00:49:59,737
You make me feel an idiot,
but I confess it hadn't.

568
00:49:59,738 --> 00:50:02,281
I wonder if it
has occurred to Isabel?

569
00:50:02,449 --> 00:50:04,200
I shall ask her.

570
00:50:04,367 --> 00:50:08,204
Don't put it in her head.
The thing would be to ask Mr. Osmond.

571
00:50:08,371 --> 00:50:12,082
I cannot. I'll not have him
inquire of me with that air of his.

572
00:50:12,250 --> 00:50:14,543
I'll ask him myself.

573
00:50:15,712 --> 00:50:19,423
I'll investigate and report to you.

574
00:50:19,424 --> 00:50:22,635
She'd marry him
for the beauty of his opinions

575
00:50:22,636 --> 00:50:25,429
or his autograph of Michelangelo.

576
00:50:27,724 --> 00:50:29,725
(Man speaking Italian )

577
00:50:44,741 --> 00:50:46,492
Excuse me.

578
00:50:55,794 --> 00:50:58,170
Which day is that?

579
00:50:58,672 --> 00:51:01,632
She wants me to go to Caparola
with her.

580
00:51:01,633 --> 00:51:03,759
(Speaking Italian )

581
00:51:08,974 --> 00:51:10,975
To go with her?

582
00:51:11,601 --> 00:51:13,727
To be there while she's there.

583
00:51:13,728 --> 00:51:17,106
She proposed it.
Of course, I gave her the chance.

584
00:51:17,107 --> 00:51:21,944
I rejoice to hear it,
but don't cry victory too soon.

585
00:51:21,945 --> 00:51:23,362
Of course you'll go.

586
00:51:26,032 --> 00:51:28,450
It makes me work, this idea of yours.

587
00:51:28,827 --> 00:51:31,078
Don't pretend you don't enjoy it.

588
00:51:32,914 --> 00:51:37,710
You've made a very good impression.
And I can see you've received one.

589
00:51:37,711 --> 00:51:41,630
You've not come to Mrs. Touchett's
so often to oblige me.

590
00:51:41,631 --> 00:51:45,718
The girl's not disagreeable.
She has only one fault.

591
00:51:45,719 --> 00:51:48,679
- what's that?
- Too many ideas.

592
00:51:48,680 --> 00:51:51,682
I warned you she was clever.

593
00:51:51,683 --> 00:51:54,310
Fortunately, they're very bad ones.

594
00:51:54,311 --> 00:51:58,439
Why is that fortunate? - No loss if
they must be sacrificed.

595
00:52:05,071 --> 00:52:06,697
You're unfathomable.

596
00:52:06,698 --> 00:52:10,367
I'm frightened at the abyss
into which I've cast her.

597
00:52:10,535 --> 00:52:13,912
You can't draw back now.
You're in too far.

598
00:52:15,248 --> 00:52:16,707
Very good.

599
00:52:16,708 --> 00:52:19,126
But you must
do the rest yourself.

600
00:52:20,170 --> 00:52:23,797
(Henrietta ) It's incredible.
There's so much work,

601
00:52:23,798 --> 00:52:27,051
and they would have been
paid a pittance for it.

602
00:52:28,219 --> 00:52:30,429
I forgot my parasol. I must go back.

603
00:52:30,430 --> 00:52:32,598
- I'll get it.
- No, it's fine.

604
00:52:32,599 --> 00:52:35,976
- Do you want some caffè?
- Yes, thank you.

605
00:53:16,768 --> 00:53:18,352
Oh!

606
00:53:21,064 --> 00:53:23,399
So you decided to come?

607
00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:26,318
Mm-hmm. I came last night.

608
00:53:26,319 --> 00:53:28,362
Hmm.

609
00:53:28,363 --> 00:53:30,531
The others are up above.

610
00:53:32,033 --> 00:53:35,327
I didn't come here for the others.

611
00:53:35,328 --> 00:53:37,413
I came to say goodbye.

612
00:53:37,414 --> 00:53:41,834
Who knows if you'll come back?
You're under no obligation to.

613
00:53:41,835 --> 00:53:44,878
- You think my travels ridiculous?
- No.

614
00:53:45,046 --> 00:53:48,257
Go everywhere, do everything.

615
00:53:48,258 --> 00:53:51,969
Be happy, be triumphant.

616
00:53:55,306 --> 00:54:00,811
- what do you mean by triumphant?
- well, doing what you like.

617
00:54:02,981 --> 00:54:06,400
Doing all the vain things one likes
may be tiresome.

618
00:54:06,401 --> 00:54:10,487
Exactly. And you'll be tired someday.

619
00:54:12,198 --> 00:54:15,826
I don't know whether
I'd better not wait until then

620
00:54:15,827 --> 00:54:18,579
for something I want
to say to you.

621
00:54:19,747 --> 00:54:22,958
I can't advise you
without knowing what it is.

622
00:54:22,959 --> 00:54:24,918
But I'm horrid when I'm tired.

623
00:54:24,919 --> 00:54:26,795
I don't believe that.

624
00:54:26,796 --> 00:54:29,882
You're angry sometimes,
that I can believe,

625
00:54:29,883 --> 00:54:32,134
but I'm sure
you're never horrid.

626
00:54:33,928 --> 00:54:36,054
Not even when I lose my temper?

627
00:54:36,055 --> 00:54:40,142
You don't lose your temper, you
find it. And that must be beautiful.

628
00:54:45,690 --> 00:54:47,816
If only I could find it now.

629
00:54:51,946 --> 00:54:53,572
I'm not afraid.

630
00:54:57,076 --> 00:55:00,537
I should fold my arms
and admire you.

631
00:55:04,542 --> 00:55:08,295
What I wish to say is that
I find I'm in love with you.

632
00:55:08,296 --> 00:55:11,965
Oh... No, that had better wait.

633
00:55:11,966 --> 00:55:14,801
No. You may heed it now or never,
as you please.

634
00:55:14,802 --> 00:55:16,803
But after all, I must say it.

635
00:55:17,555 --> 00:55:20,849
I'm absolutely in love with you.

636
00:55:22,894 --> 00:55:24,603
Don't say that, please.

637
00:55:24,604 --> 00:55:26,230
It will not matter to you.

638
00:55:26,231 --> 00:55:29,858
I have neither fame nor fortune,
so I offer nothing.

639
00:55:31,027 --> 00:55:34,321
I think I'm glad
that we're separating.

640
00:55:34,322 --> 00:55:37,616
If you weren't going away,
you'd know me better.

641
00:55:37,617 --> 00:55:39,826
I shall do that some other time.

642
00:55:42,205 --> 00:55:47,334
There's one thing more, a little
service I should like to ask.

643
00:55:47,502 --> 00:55:50,504
I'm going to Rome for a few days.

644
00:55:50,505 --> 00:55:53,465
Would you visit my daughter
before you leave Florence?

645
00:55:57,303 --> 00:56:00,556
Yes, of course.

646
00:56:07,438 --> 00:56:09,022
Oh...

647
00:56:50,523 --> 00:56:54,192
(Henrietta ) Hello? Hello?

648
00:56:54,193 --> 00:56:56,236
Isabel, are you down there?

649
00:56:59,073 --> 00:57:01,199
We've got your coffee waiting!

650
00:57:02,952 --> 00:57:05,787
Hello? Can you see her down there?

651
00:57:05,788 --> 00:57:09,041
- (Ralph ) It's dark.
- Hello?

652
00:57:10,460 --> 00:57:12,044
Oh, hello.

653
00:57:20,178 --> 00:57:24,014
I think they're the
most beautiful gardens in the world.

654
00:57:26,434 --> 00:57:29,519
Not that I've been
everywhere in the world.

655
00:57:32,607 --> 00:57:36,777
Papa says while he's away,
I'm not to go beyond this line.

656
00:57:39,155 --> 00:57:41,239
Your father says that?

657
00:57:41,240 --> 00:57:43,617
He thinks I will get scorched.

658
00:57:46,829 --> 00:57:47,996
Hmm.

659
00:57:49,248 --> 00:57:52,959
Here... share my parasol.

660
00:58:02,095 --> 00:58:04,012
What is it?

661
00:58:11,604 --> 00:58:14,564
No, you're right to do
as your father says.

662
00:58:15,983 --> 00:58:19,611
He'll never ask you
anything unreasonable.

663
00:58:23,491 --> 00:58:25,283
Want tea?

664
00:59:09,704 --> 00:59:11,538
(Isabel) There it is!

665
00:59:16,878 --> 00:59:20,338
(Serena ) 'Nine, ten. Excuse me.'
(Isabel) 'No, no, no.'

666
00:59:28,055 --> 00:59:30,390
(Osmond) 'what I wish to say is that

667
00:59:30,391 --> 00:59:33,685
'I'm absolutely in love with you.'

668
00:59:33,686 --> 00:59:37,481
(Women's voices ) 'I'm absolutely in
love with you... in love with you.'

669
00:59:40,276 --> 00:59:43,779

'I'm absolutely in love with you.'

'I'm absolutely in love with you.

673

'Absolutely in love with you.'

674

(Isabel)
'I'm absolutely in love with you.'

675
01:00:03,216 --> 01:00:06,384
(Osmond)
'I'm absolutely in love with you.'

676
01:00:06,385 --> 01:00:09,846
(Osmond and Isabel)
'I'm absolutely in love with you.'

677
01:00:09,847 --> 01:00:11,515
(Isabel) Oh, oh, oh...

678
01:00:19,941 --> 01:00:22,234
(Workers speaking Italian )

679
01:00:48,886 --> 01:00:50,470
(Speaking Italian )

680
01:01:10,700 --> 01:01:13,910
I can't tell you how I hoped
you wouldn't come.

681
01:01:20,126 --> 01:01:22,043
I've no doubt of that.

682
01:01:26,465 --> 01:01:29,259
I gave you forewarning
I'd do as I choose.

683
01:01:29,427 --> 01:01:33,972
I wanted to hear your explanation
of you having changed your mind.

684
01:01:33,973 --> 01:01:35,473
An explanation?

685
01:01:35,474 --> 01:01:39,185
- Do you think I'm bound to explain?
- You were very positive.

686
01:01:39,186 --> 01:01:40,896
I did believe it.

687
01:01:45,151 --> 01:01:46,943
I've not deceived you.

688
01:01:46,944 --> 01:01:49,029
I was perfectly free.

689
01:01:50,448 --> 01:01:54,618
When I had your letter, I thought
there might be some mistake.

690
01:01:56,621 --> 01:01:58,663
There's no mistake whatever.

691
01:02:04,462 --> 01:02:07,547
Well... I've done what I wished.

692
01:02:10,509 --> 01:02:12,260
I've seen you.

693
01:02:31,614 --> 01:02:34,741
Do you mean you came
simply to look at me?

694
01:02:41,123 --> 01:02:42,916
(Door closes )

695
01:02:57,682 --> 01:02:59,099
(Coughing from inside )

696
01:03:08,192 --> 01:03:10,193
(Coughing)

697
01:03:16,867 --> 01:03:18,785
You didn't come up for lunch.

698
01:03:22,832 --> 01:03:25,208
(Coughing) I'm not hungry.

699
01:03:27,753 --> 01:03:31,381
You ought to eat. You live on air.

700
01:03:36,804 --> 01:03:38,888
I haven't congratulated you.

701
01:03:43,686 --> 01:03:46,855
I wondered why you were silent.

702
01:03:46,856 --> 01:03:50,483
I hardly got over my surprise
since my mother told me.

703
01:03:50,484 --> 01:03:53,820
You're the last person
I expected to see caught.

704
01:03:56,449 --> 01:03:59,492
I don't see why you call it "caught".

705
01:03:59,493 --> 01:04:01,494
(Coughs )

706
01:04:05,124 --> 01:04:08,168
Because you're going to be
put into a cage.

707
01:04:08,169 --> 01:04:11,588
If I like my cage,
that needn't trouble you.

708
01:04:17,344 --> 01:04:19,804
I'd treated myself... (Coughs )

709
01:04:19,805 --> 01:04:22,223
to a charming vision of your future.

710
01:04:25,144 --> 01:04:29,689
I'd amused myself with planning out
high destiny for you.

711
01:04:29,690 --> 01:04:34,027
There was to be nothing
of this sort in it.

712
01:04:34,028 --> 01:04:37,197
You were not to come down
so easily or so soon.

713
01:04:37,198 --> 01:04:39,199
"Come down"?

714
01:04:40,576 --> 01:04:42,160
It hurts me.

715
01:04:43,704 --> 01:04:47,040
Hurts me as if I'd fallen myself.

716
01:04:51,253 --> 01:04:53,004
I don't understand you.

717
01:04:53,172 --> 01:04:55,548
I should have said...

718
01:04:55,716 --> 01:04:59,552
the man for you
would have had a more...

719
01:04:59,553 --> 01:05:01,179
active, larger...

720
01:05:01,180 --> 01:05:03,807
freer sort of nature.

721
01:05:05,017 --> 01:05:09,354
I can't get over the sense
that Osmond is... is somehow...

722
01:05:09,355 --> 01:05:11,940
(Clears throat) ..well, small.

723
01:05:14,568 --> 01:05:16,694
"Small."

724
01:05:16,695 --> 01:05:19,697
I think he's narrow... selfish.

725
01:05:19,698 --> 01:05:22,200
He takes himself so seriously.

726
01:05:22,201 --> 01:05:25,870
(Coughs )
He's the incarnation of taste.

727
01:05:25,871 --> 01:05:27,831
His taste is exquisite.

728
01:05:27,832 --> 01:05:32,210
You ever seen such a taste,
a really exquisite one, ruffled?

729
01:05:32,211 --> 01:05:36,965
I hope I will never fail
to gratify my husband's.

730
01:05:37,133 --> 01:05:39,259
Oh.

731
01:05:39,260 --> 01:05:42,387
That's... that's capital, that's...

732
01:05:42,555 --> 01:05:44,264
Wonderful!

733
01:05:44,265 --> 01:05:47,058
That's what every wife
would wish for.

734
01:05:47,059 --> 01:05:50,186
But weren't you meant
for something better

735
01:05:50,187 --> 01:05:54,065
than to guard the sensibilities
of a sterile dilettante?

736
01:05:57,987 --> 01:06:00,363
I've said what I've had on my mind.

737
01:06:03,951 --> 01:06:06,828
Said it because I love you.

738
01:06:06,829 --> 01:06:09,122
Then you're not disinterested.

739
01:06:15,045 --> 01:06:17,297
I love you, but without hope.

740
01:06:24,972 --> 01:06:28,641
I see Mr. Osmond in quite another way.

741
01:06:28,642 --> 01:06:31,352
He's not important, no.
He's not rich.

742
01:06:32,563 --> 01:06:36,566
He has no titles
nor honours nor property.

743
01:06:38,235 --> 01:06:42,447
If that's what you mean by small,
he's as small as you please.

744
01:06:42,448 --> 01:06:44,699
I call that large.

745
01:06:45,910 --> 01:06:48,203
It's the largest thing I know.

746
01:06:49,747 --> 01:06:53,791
He... he has the gentlest,

747
01:06:53,792 --> 01:06:58,046
kindest, lightest spirit.

748
01:07:01,050 --> 01:07:03,843
You've got hold of a false idea.

749
01:07:06,263 --> 01:07:08,681
It's a pity, but I can't help it.

750
01:07:11,769 --> 01:07:15,188
(Coughing)

751
01:07:31,830 --> 01:07:35,291
(Osmond) They think I'm
in love with your money.

752
01:07:35,292 --> 01:07:37,418
(Isabel) How do you know?

753
01:07:37,419 --> 01:07:39,712
You've not told me they're pleased,

754
01:07:39,880 --> 01:07:42,757
and if they had been,
I should have had some sign of it.

755
01:07:44,468 --> 01:07:46,719
(Osmond) I care for only one thing,

756
01:07:46,887 --> 01:07:49,764
for you not having
the shadow of a doubt.

757
01:07:49,765 --> 01:07:52,141
You know I have not, not one shadow.

758
01:07:52,142 --> 01:07:55,270
I have never in my life
tried to earn a penny.

759
01:07:55,271 --> 01:07:57,939
I ought to be less
subject to suspicion

760
01:07:57,940 --> 01:08:00,525
than most people one sees grubbing.

761
01:08:00,526 --> 01:08:05,238
I won't pretend I'm sorry
you're rich, I'm delighted.

762
01:08:05,239 --> 01:08:09,117
At moments I'd like to kneel
by my uncle's grave and thank him.

763
01:08:10,411 --> 01:08:12,912
It has made me better, loving you.

764
01:08:12,913 --> 01:08:16,040
I'm not a failure,
as I used to think.

765
01:08:16,041 --> 01:08:18,167
I've succeeded in two things.

766
01:08:18,168 --> 01:08:20,253
I am to marry the woman I adore,

767
01:08:20,254 --> 01:08:23,423
and I've brought up
my child in the old way.

768
01:08:23,590 --> 01:08:28,261
(Osmond) We'll amuse ourselves
making up some little life for her.

769
01:09:04,048 --> 01:09:07,050
(Man ) That's why
I wanted your advice...

770
01:09:07,051 --> 01:09:10,136
as an old friend
of Miss Osmond's family.

771
01:09:10,137 --> 01:09:14,766
What have you got besides your
Spanish lace and Dresden teacups?

772
01:09:14,933 --> 01:09:19,979
My collection's well thought of and
I've a comfortable little fortune,

773
01:09:19,980 --> 01:09:23,316
about 40,000 francs a year.

774
01:09:23,317 --> 01:09:26,569
Miss Osmond and I
can live beautifully on that.

775
01:09:27,154 --> 01:09:31,532
Beautifully? No. Sufficiently, yes.

776
01:09:32,701 --> 01:09:34,869
Her father can give you nothing.

777
01:09:36,246 --> 01:09:38,956
He, uh, he lives like a rich man.

778
01:09:38,957 --> 01:09:40,666
The money's his wife's.

779
01:09:40,667 --> 01:09:43,086
She brought him a large fortune.

780
01:09:43,087 --> 01:09:47,048
Mrs. Osmond is fond of her
stepdaughter, she may do something.

781
01:09:48,217 --> 01:09:51,552
For a lovesick man,
you have your wits about you.

782
01:09:54,431 --> 01:09:59,102
No, she will probably prefer to keep
her money for her own children.

783
01:09:59,269 --> 01:10:02,980
Her own children?
Surely she has none.

784
01:10:03,148 --> 01:10:05,608
She may have yet.

785
01:10:05,609 --> 01:10:09,404
She had a poor little boy
who died almost two years ago.

786
01:10:10,489 --> 01:10:12,865
I'm... very sorry.

787
01:10:14,034 --> 01:10:17,161
Uh, she's a splendid woman.

788
01:10:23,585 --> 01:10:26,587
I don't say your offer's
to be jumped at,

789
01:10:26,588 --> 01:10:28,798
but there might be a worse one.

790
01:10:30,634 --> 01:10:34,137
Mr. Osmond, however,
will believe he can do better.

791
01:10:37,182 --> 01:10:39,058
He can do better, perhaps,

792
01:10:39,059 --> 01:10:43,646
but his daughter can do no better
than marry the man she loves.

793
01:10:43,814 --> 01:10:45,648
Well, she does, you know.

794
01:10:45,649 --> 01:10:49,861
And, in the meanwhile,
I'll say a word to Mrs. Osmond.

795
01:10:49,862 --> 01:10:53,573
No. No, don't set her going,
or you'll spoil everything.

796
01:10:53,574 --> 01:10:56,784
Her husband's
sure to have other views.

797
01:10:56,785 --> 01:11:02,206
I advise you not to multiply the
points of difference between them.

798
01:11:03,333 --> 01:11:06,961
Let the matter alone until
I've taken a few soundings.

799
01:11:06,962 --> 01:11:09,839
Let the matter alone?

800
01:11:09,840 --> 01:11:11,424
But I'm in love!

801
01:11:13,469 --> 01:11:15,470
Oh, you won't burn up.

802
01:11:41,330 --> 01:11:43,331
(Chattering)

803
01:12:00,641 --> 01:12:24,664
(Speaking Italian )

804
01:12:36,134 --> 01:12:37,552
Where is Pansy?

805
01:12:38,637 --> 01:12:40,638
She has already come down.

806
01:13:17,050 --> 01:13:18,884
(Speaking Italian )

807
01:13:31,356 --> 01:13:33,441
(Osmond) I hate his proposal.

808
01:13:35,110 --> 01:13:38,404
I let him see that.
I was rude to him on purpose.

809
01:13:39,573 --> 01:13:41,574
I'll tell him you'll think it over.

810
01:13:41,575 --> 01:13:44,744
No! Don't do that, he'll hang on.

811
01:13:44,745 --> 01:13:47,163
I hate talking with a donkey...

812
01:13:47,164 --> 01:13:49,206
(Imitates donkey )

813
01:13:51,251 --> 01:13:53,252
He's a gentleman.

814
01:13:53,962 --> 01:13:56,047
He has a charming temper...

815
01:13:57,215 --> 01:13:59,925
and, after all, a comfortable income.

816
01:13:59,926 --> 01:14:02,553
It's misery, genteel misery.

817
01:14:02,554 --> 01:14:04,972
It's not what I dreamed of for Pansy.

818
01:14:05,140 --> 01:14:08,559
Fortunately, this doesn't
find me unprepared.

819
01:14:08,560 --> 01:14:10,728
It's what I educated her for.

820
01:14:10,896 --> 01:14:14,523
It's all for this, that
when a case like this should come up,

821
01:14:14,691 --> 01:14:17,109
she should do what I prefer.

822
01:14:27,371 --> 01:14:31,582
I've never been treated so.
I don't know what's against me.

823
01:14:31,583 --> 01:14:35,586
It's not how I'm considered.
I could have married 20 times.

824
01:14:35,587 --> 01:14:37,963
You're not rich enough for Pansy.

825
01:14:37,964 --> 01:14:42,009
- She doesn't care about money.
- No. But her father does.

826
01:14:42,010 --> 01:14:45,262
Oh, yes. well, you would know that.

827
01:14:58,694 --> 01:15:00,486
You're offended.

828
01:15:01,530 --> 01:15:04,156
And now you'll never help me.

829
01:15:04,157 --> 01:15:05,741
It's not that I won't...

830
01:15:07,327 --> 01:15:09,453
I simply can't.

831
01:15:14,751 --> 01:15:18,003
(Osmond) Isabel,
I bring you an old friend.

832
01:15:18,004 --> 01:15:20,047
Lord Warburton.

833
01:15:20,048 --> 01:15:22,967
I've only just arrived
this afternoon.

834
01:15:22,968 --> 01:15:27,096
I knew you were at home
on Thursdays, so... I came.

835
01:15:27,264 --> 01:15:31,350
You see, the fame of your Thursdays
has spread to England. Excuse me.

836
01:15:35,355 --> 01:15:37,231
We're greatly flattered.

837
01:15:37,232 --> 01:15:39,442
I'm really very glad to see you.

838
01:15:39,693 --> 01:15:43,779
There's something I must tell you
without further delay.

839
01:15:43,780 --> 01:15:46,741
I've brought
Ralph Touchett with me.

840
01:15:46,742 --> 01:15:49,326
No, no, he's not here.
He's at the hotel.

841
01:15:49,327 --> 01:15:51,245
He was too tired to come.

842
01:15:51,246 --> 01:15:53,664
Why has he come to Rome?

843
01:15:53,665 --> 01:15:56,625
He's very far gone, Mrs. Osmond.

844
01:15:56,626 --> 01:16:01,505
He can't keep warm. And the further
south we come, the colder he feels.

845
01:16:01,506 --> 01:16:03,466
If you don't mind my saying,

846
01:16:03,467 --> 01:16:08,429
it was the most extraordinary time
for Mrs. Touchett to go to America.

847
01:16:11,933 --> 01:16:15,144
Do you know what your father
said to me just now?

848
01:16:15,312 --> 01:16:19,231
Don't speak so loud.
Everyone will hear.

849
01:16:19,232 --> 01:16:21,442
He says you've forgotten me.

850
01:16:21,443 --> 01:16:24,945
No... I don't forget.

851
01:16:27,699 --> 01:16:29,617
Everything's just the same?

852
01:16:32,204 --> 01:16:36,373
Not the very same.
Papa's been terribly severe.

853
01:16:36,374 --> 01:16:38,250
He forbids me to marry you.

854
01:16:38,251 --> 01:16:40,085
Need you mind that?

855
01:16:41,463 --> 01:16:44,089
I can't disobey Papa.

856
01:16:44,090 --> 01:16:46,091
You sacrifice me like that?

857
01:16:50,806 --> 01:16:53,140
I love you just as much.

858
01:16:53,308 --> 01:16:55,142
What good will that do me?

859
01:16:56,770 --> 01:17:01,440
Please don't talk any more.
Papa said I was not to talk to you.

860
01:17:02,859 --> 01:17:04,652
It's too much.

861
01:17:10,367 --> 01:17:15,329
- May I introduce you to some people?
- Oh, no, please don't.

862
01:17:15,330 --> 01:17:18,290
Unless it be to that young lady
at the tea table.

863
01:17:18,291 --> 01:17:20,376
She has a charming face.

864
01:17:20,377 --> 01:17:22,586
That's my husband's daughter.

865
01:17:22,587 --> 01:17:24,296
What a dear little maid.

866
01:17:24,297 --> 01:17:28,342
- You must meet her.
- Oh, in a... in a moment.

867
01:17:29,553 --> 01:17:31,637
I like looking at her from here.

868
01:17:36,977 --> 01:17:40,604
You know... you've changed a bit.

869
01:17:41,690 --> 01:17:43,190
Yes, a good deal.

870
01:17:43,191 --> 01:17:45,776
I don't mean for the worse,
of course.

871
01:17:47,237 --> 01:17:49,238
And yet how can I say for the better?

872
01:17:53,076 --> 01:17:55,870
(Clears throat) Oh.

873
01:18:14,639 --> 01:18:17,933
I think, after all,
that I shan't go to Sicily.

874
01:18:17,934 --> 01:18:19,768
Won't go to Sicily?

875
01:18:19,769 --> 01:18:21,729
(Isabel) Where will you go?

876
01:18:25,233 --> 01:18:27,067
I guess I won't go anywhere.

877
01:18:27,235 --> 01:18:28,819
You'll return to England?

878
01:18:29,946 --> 01:18:31,739
Oh, dear, no.

879
01:18:31,740 --> 01:18:35,159
- I'll stay in Rome.
- (Warburton ) Rome won't do.

880
01:18:35,160 --> 01:18:38,454
- (Isabel) Rome's too cold.
- It will have to do.

881
01:18:41,374 --> 01:18:43,125
(Warburton ) Try Sicily.

882
01:18:43,126 --> 01:18:45,544
I can't try.
I can't move further.

883
01:18:45,545 --> 01:18:49,465
I can't face the journey.
And I haven't a cousin in Sicily.

884
01:18:51,176 --> 01:18:53,177
What does the doctor say?

885
01:18:55,972 --> 01:18:59,558
(Sighs ) I haven't asked him,
and I don't care a fig.

886
01:18:59,559 --> 01:19:01,894
If I die here, you'll bury me.

887
01:19:03,021 --> 01:19:05,064
You shan't die here.

888
01:19:16,534 --> 01:19:19,411
(Ralph ) I can't believe
she's so cold.

889
01:19:19,412 --> 01:19:22,998
She's utterly changed. It's Osmond.

890
01:19:33,635 --> 01:19:35,678
(Begging alms in Italian )

891
01:19:37,931 --> 01:19:42,059
I recommend that you get
the doctor's consent all the same.

892
01:19:42,060 --> 01:19:46,271
(Sighs ) The doctor's consent
would spoil it.

893
01:19:46,272 --> 01:19:50,317
You're sacrificing your health
to your curiosity, then?

894
01:19:50,485 --> 01:19:55,364
I'm not interested in my health,
I'm deeply interested in Mrs. Osmond.

895
01:19:55,532 --> 01:19:57,533
So am I.

896
01:19:57,701 --> 01:19:59,827
Not as I once was.

897
01:19:59,828 --> 01:20:01,829
(Ralph coughs )

898
01:20:09,254 --> 01:20:12,798
Permit to ask whether it's
to bring out that fact

899
01:20:12,799 --> 01:20:16,051
that you're so very civil
to the little girl?

900
01:20:16,052 --> 01:20:18,554
Does that strike you as ridiculous?

901
01:20:19,764 --> 01:20:24,518
Of course, there's the difference
in our ages... more than 20 years.

902
01:20:26,062 --> 01:20:29,440
My dear Warburton... are you serious?

903
01:20:31,067 --> 01:20:34,445
Perfectly serious...
as far as I've got.

904
01:20:36,740 --> 01:20:38,741
(Sighs )

905
01:20:41,327 --> 01:20:42,828
I'm glad.

906
01:20:42,829 --> 01:20:46,290
And heaven help us
how cheered up Osmond will be.

907
01:20:46,291 --> 01:20:49,626
I say, don't spoil it.
Do you judge she'll be pleased?

908
01:20:49,627 --> 01:20:52,171
The girl? Delighted, surely.

909
01:20:52,172 --> 01:20:54,673
No, no. I mean Mrs. Osmond.

910
01:21:11,149 --> 01:21:13,358
(Speaking Italian )

911
01:21:28,458 --> 01:21:30,459
Lord Warburton was here?

912
01:21:32,420 --> 01:21:35,839
Yes. He stayed half an hour.

913
01:21:38,635 --> 01:21:41,428
Did he talk to Pansy?

914
01:21:41,429 --> 01:21:43,639
He talked almost only to her.

915
01:21:50,855 --> 01:21:53,732
It seems to me he's attentive.

916
01:21:53,900 --> 01:21:55,734
Isn't that what you call it?

917
01:21:55,902 --> 01:22:00,739
I don't call it anything. I'm waiting
for you to give it a name.

918
01:22:00,740 --> 01:22:02,741
Will you excuse us?

919
01:22:19,259 --> 01:22:22,636
That's a consideration
you don't always show.

920
01:22:24,264 --> 01:22:29,643
I... I had determined this time
to try and act as you'd like.

921
01:22:38,194 --> 01:22:40,362
Are you trying to quarrel with me?

922
01:22:40,530 --> 01:22:44,116
No. I'm trying to live at peace.

923
01:22:44,117 --> 01:22:45,826
An excellent resolve.

924
01:22:47,120 --> 01:22:49,121
Your temper isn't good.

925
01:22:53,209 --> 01:22:58,297
That's partly why I've not spoken
about this business of my daughter's.

926
01:22:58,298 --> 01:23:01,550
I was afraid I should
encounter opposition.

927
01:23:08,641 --> 01:23:11,935
I've sent little Rosier
about his business.

928
01:23:13,104 --> 01:23:16,857
You see, I believe my daughter
only has to sit perfectly quiet

929
01:23:16,858 --> 01:23:18,567
to become Lady Warburton.

930
01:23:20,403 --> 01:23:23,530
Perhaps she won't sit
perfectly still.

931
01:23:23,531 --> 01:23:26,617
If she loses Mr. Rosier,
she may jump up.

932
01:23:27,827 --> 01:23:31,205
Pansy would like to be a great lady.

933
01:23:31,206 --> 01:23:33,957
She wishes above all to please.

934
01:23:35,376 --> 01:23:37,377
To please Mr. Rosier, perhaps?

935
01:23:38,713 --> 01:23:40,714
No. To please me.

936
01:23:50,600 --> 01:23:54,895
Meantime, I should like our
distinguished visitor to speak.

937
01:23:57,398 --> 01:23:59,816
He has spoken.

938
01:23:59,984 --> 01:24:04,529
He said it would be a great pleasure
to believe she could care for him.

939
01:24:05,281 --> 01:24:07,241
Why didn't you tell me that?

940
01:24:07,242 --> 01:24:09,952
There was no opportunity.

941
01:24:11,246 --> 01:24:13,247
You know how we live.

942
01:24:14,666 --> 01:24:17,125
Why didn't he speak to me, then?

943
01:24:17,961 --> 01:24:20,170
You should have patience.

944
01:24:20,171 --> 01:24:22,297
Englishmen are shy.

945
01:24:22,298 --> 01:24:25,133
This one's not,
not when he made love to you.

946
01:24:25,134 --> 01:24:26,468
I beg your pardon?

947
01:24:26,469 --> 01:24:28,428
He was extremely so.

948
01:24:28,429 --> 01:24:30,430
Oh, I see.

949
01:24:33,559 --> 01:24:37,062
You must have a great deal
of influence with him.

950
01:24:37,897 --> 01:24:42,609
I'm sure the moment you really wish
it, you can bring him to the point.

951
01:24:52,370 --> 01:24:54,162
Well...

952
01:24:58,501 --> 01:25:00,419
It lies in your hands.

953
01:25:00,420 --> 01:25:03,255
I shall leave it there.

954
01:25:03,256 --> 01:25:06,216
With a little goodwill,
you may manage it.

955
01:25:07,802 --> 01:25:10,721
Think that over. Hmm?

956
01:25:12,015 --> 01:25:14,641
And remember how much I count on you.

957
01:25:26,154 --> 01:25:27,904
(Ballroom music
and chattering in Italian )

958
01:26:33,679 --> 01:26:35,680
It's all Pansy's.

959
01:26:35,681 --> 01:26:37,182
It must be hers.

960
01:26:37,183 --> 01:26:40,685
Yes. She gave it to me to hold.

961
01:26:40,686 --> 01:26:42,687
May I hold it?

962
01:26:45,400 --> 01:26:47,401
May I at least have a flower?

963
01:26:52,698 --> 01:26:55,492
It's frightful
what I'm doing for you.

964
01:27:02,917 --> 01:27:06,628
Don't put it in your buttonhole,
don't for the world.

965
01:27:08,464 --> 01:27:10,882
You pity me.

966
01:27:12,218 --> 01:27:14,428
But don't you pity her a little?

967
01:27:29,277 --> 01:27:30,777
(Waltz begins )

968
01:27:50,089 --> 01:27:53,550
(Warburton ) 'She's promised
a dance with me later.'

969
01:27:53,551 --> 01:27:55,844
(Isabel) 'For the cotillion?'

970
01:27:55,845 --> 01:27:59,389
'No, I didn't ask her for that.
It's a quadrille.'

971
01:27:59,390 --> 01:28:01,308
You're not clever.

972
01:28:01,309 --> 01:28:05,520
I told her to keep the cotillion
in case you should ask for it.

973
01:28:05,521 --> 01:28:08,064
Poor little maid. Fancy that.

974
01:28:08,065 --> 01:28:11,443
She didn't say.
Of course I will, if you like.

975
01:28:11,444 --> 01:28:15,238
If I like? Oh, you dance with her
only because I like it.

976
01:28:15,239 --> 01:28:17,240
I'm afraid I bore her.

977
01:28:18,409 --> 01:28:20,952
She has a lot of young fellows
on her book.

978
01:28:24,373 --> 01:28:26,791
Please, let me understand.

979
01:28:26,792 --> 01:28:28,835
Understand what?

980
01:28:28,836 --> 01:28:32,130
You told me you'd like
to marry my stepdaughter,

981
01:28:32,131 --> 01:28:33,924
you've not forgotten it?

982
01:28:33,925 --> 01:28:37,511
Forgotten it? No.
I wrote to Mr. Osmond this morning.

983
01:28:37,512 --> 01:28:40,472
He didn't mention to me
that he'd heard from you.

984
01:28:40,473 --> 01:28:43,391
It's an awkward sort of letter
to write.

985
01:28:45,686 --> 01:28:47,687
Don't forget to send it.

986
01:29:19,428 --> 01:29:21,638
Oh, most certainly.

987
01:29:24,058 --> 01:29:25,809
Are you not dancing?

988
01:29:25,810 --> 01:29:28,728
Certainly not,
if I can't dance with her.

989
01:29:30,856 --> 01:29:34,442
- You should leave, then.
- Not until she does.

990
01:29:42,743 --> 01:29:45,870
(Warburton ) Who's your dismal friend?

991
01:29:45,871 --> 01:29:47,998
He has a face a yard long.

992
01:29:47,999 --> 01:29:50,125
He has reason.

993
01:29:50,126 --> 01:29:53,336
- My husband won't listen to him.
- Oh, dear me.

994
01:29:53,337 --> 01:29:56,464
He looked a well set-up young fellow.

995
01:29:56,465 --> 01:29:58,800
You've a kind thought
even for a rival.

996
01:30:00,177 --> 01:30:01,886
A rival?

997
01:30:06,142 --> 01:30:08,852
You don't mean
that she cares for him?

998
01:30:11,063 --> 01:30:12,897
Well, yes...

999
01:30:12,898 --> 01:30:15,191
I think she does.

1000
01:30:15,359 --> 01:30:19,696
You said she'd have no wish but her
father's and that he favoured me.

1001
01:30:19,697 --> 01:30:23,241
I told you she had an immense wish
to please her father.

1002
01:30:25,036 --> 01:30:27,037
That seems very proper.

1003
01:30:28,581 --> 01:30:29,956
Very proper...

1004
01:30:35,755 --> 01:30:41,259
but hardly the sort of feeling a man
would wish to be indebted for a wife.

1005
01:30:45,014 --> 01:30:49,684
Why are you so unwilling,
so... sceptical?

1006
01:31:07,578 --> 01:31:11,164
- You're the most wonderful dancer.
- Oh, thank you.

1007
01:31:50,955 --> 01:31:53,581
I want you to answer me a question.

1008
01:31:55,626 --> 01:31:57,627
It's about Lord Warburton.

1009
01:31:59,088 --> 01:32:01,089
(Clears throat)

1010
01:32:02,508 --> 01:32:04,509
Is...

1011
01:32:05,886 --> 01:32:08,304
Is he really in love?

1012
01:32:12,685 --> 01:32:15,729
Yes, I think, very much.
I can make that out.

1013
01:32:15,730 --> 01:32:17,313
Oh.

1014
01:32:19,108 --> 01:32:21,359
You seem disappointed.

1015
01:32:24,321 --> 01:32:25,697
No...

1016
01:32:27,366 --> 01:32:30,201
No, only mistaken.

1017
01:32:32,788 --> 01:32:36,249
I'd made out that
he doesn't really care for Pansy.

1018
01:32:36,417 --> 01:32:38,460
Oh, for Pansy, no.

1019
01:32:39,253 --> 01:32:41,546
But you just said now that he did.

1020
01:32:41,547 --> 01:32:43,548
That he cared for you.

1021
01:32:47,303 --> 01:32:51,181
- That is nonsense, you know.
- To me, he's denied it.

1022
01:32:59,815 --> 01:33:01,816
Ralph...

1023
01:33:03,778 --> 01:33:05,737
you give me no help.

1024
01:33:12,244 --> 01:33:14,329
How unhappy you must be.

1025
01:33:27,259 --> 01:33:31,012
When... when I talk of
your helping me, I...

1026
01:33:31,013 --> 01:33:33,723
I- I talk great nonsense.

1027
01:33:33,724 --> 01:33:38,728
The idea of troubling you
with my domestic embarrassments...

1028
01:33:39,563 --> 01:33:42,273
Your husband may think you haven't...

1029
01:33:42,274 --> 01:33:44,067
pushed enough.

1030
01:33:44,068 --> 01:33:46,986
It's a matter we can hardly
quarrel about,

1031
01:33:46,987 --> 01:33:50,240
for almost all of the interest
is on his side.

1032
01:33:51,617 --> 01:33:54,536
You know what his interest
will make him say?

1033
01:33:54,537 --> 01:33:58,873
It will make him say that your lack
of zeal is owing to jealousy.

1034
01:33:58,874 --> 01:34:01,960
- To jealousy?
- To jealousy of his daughter.

1035
01:34:03,587 --> 01:34:06,047
Oh, you're not kind.

1036
01:34:07,091 --> 01:34:09,717
Be frank with me, and you'll see.

1037
01:35:03,355 --> 01:35:05,773
If I try to learn what you want...

1038
01:35:07,985 --> 01:35:09,903
what you desire...

1039
01:35:13,365 --> 01:35:16,367
it's only so that
I may act accordingly.

1040
01:35:18,787 --> 01:35:23,708
The only thing I want in life...
is to marry Mr. Rosier.

1041
01:35:26,211 --> 01:35:29,923
Your father would like you
to make a better marriage.

1042
01:35:34,303 --> 01:35:36,554
What should you like me to do?

1043
01:35:36,555 --> 01:35:38,723
Lord Warburton...

1044
01:35:40,643 --> 01:35:42,852
has shown you great attention.

1045
01:35:42,853 --> 01:35:46,481
If you mean that
he'll propose for me,

1046
01:35:46,482 --> 01:35:49,150
I think you're mistaken.

1047
01:35:52,905 --> 01:35:55,615
Your father
would like it extremely.

1048
01:35:55,616 --> 01:35:59,202
Lord Warburton won't propose
simply to please Papa.

1049
01:35:59,370 --> 01:36:02,080
Oh, no. There's no danger.

1050
01:36:02,623 --> 01:36:04,624
There's no danger.

1051
01:36:05,042 --> 01:36:06,709
It's as if he said to me,

1052
01:36:06,710 --> 01:36:10,004
"I like you very much,
but if it doesn't please you,

1053
01:36:10,005 --> 01:36:12,382
"I would never say it again."

1054
01:36:14,009 --> 01:36:17,261
And... he doesn't
care for me, either.

1055
01:36:18,430 --> 01:36:21,224
Oh, no. There's no danger.

1056
01:36:21,225 --> 01:36:23,726
You must tell your father that.

1057
01:36:26,897 --> 01:36:28,523
I'd rather not.

1058
01:36:30,776 --> 01:36:33,653
You wouldn't let him have
false hopes?

1059
01:36:36,615 --> 01:36:40,159
But it will be good for me
that he should.

1060
01:36:40,327 --> 01:36:43,037
Then Papa won't propose
anyone else...

1061
01:36:43,205 --> 01:36:47,000
and that will be
a great advantage for me.

1062
01:36:53,048 --> 01:36:54,549
(Whispering) Rosier.

1063
01:37:02,850 --> 01:37:06,811
Does Warburton form his words
with such difficulty?

1064
01:37:08,355 --> 01:37:09,814
Hmm?

1065
01:37:10,941 --> 01:37:14,777
When he told you he intended to
write, what did you say to him?

1066
01:37:16,572 --> 01:37:18,865
I think I told him not to forget it.

1067
01:37:18,866 --> 01:37:22,285
Apparently, he has forgotten.
Please remind him.

1068
01:37:22,453 --> 01:37:26,247
If hands are to be laid on
Lord Warburton, lay them yourself.

1069
01:37:26,415 --> 01:37:28,833
It's hard with you
working against me.

1070
01:37:29,001 --> 01:37:31,085
I told you I'd do what I could.

1071
01:37:31,086 --> 01:37:33,838
Yes, that gained you time.

1072
01:37:35,924 --> 01:37:39,052
My husband and I were
just now talking of you.

1073
01:37:39,053 --> 01:37:43,806
We wondered what had become of you.
We thought perhaps you'd gone away.

1074
01:37:44,975 --> 01:37:46,976
I'm only on the point of going.

1075
01:37:46,977 --> 01:37:50,188
I find myself suddenly
recalled to England.

1076
01:37:50,189 --> 01:37:53,316
I'm awfully sorry
to leave poor Touchett.

1077
01:37:53,317 --> 01:37:55,735
Take poor Touchett with you.

1078
01:37:55,736 --> 01:37:58,279
He'd better wait for warmer weather.

1079
01:37:58,280 --> 01:38:01,657
I shouldn't advise him
to... to travel just now.

1080
01:38:01,825 --> 01:38:03,451
Hmm.

1081
01:38:03,452 --> 01:38:07,371
I have a letter to write
before dinner. will you excuse me?

1082
01:38:07,539 --> 01:38:11,542
Of course, when you come to Rome,
you'll always look us up.

1083
01:38:23,263 --> 01:38:25,556
I'm glad it's the last time.

1084
01:38:28,644 --> 01:38:30,144
So am I.

1085
01:38:30,145 --> 01:38:32,188
She doesn't care for me.

1086
01:38:49,581 --> 01:38:51,582
Good night, Papa.

1087
01:38:52,417 --> 01:38:54,544
Good night. Sleep well.

1088
01:38:59,133 --> 01:39:02,009
Don't go. I have
something to say to you.

1089
01:39:28,871 --> 01:39:31,664
I don't understand
what you wish to do.

1090
01:39:31,832 --> 01:39:34,167
I wish to go to bed. I'm very tired.

1091
01:39:42,801 --> 01:39:46,429
I think you're trying
to humiliate me.

1092
01:39:46,430 --> 01:39:49,098
You're playing a very deep game.

1093
01:39:49,099 --> 01:39:51,225
You've managed it beautifully.

1094
01:39:53,437 --> 01:39:54,979
What have I managed?

1095
01:39:54,980 --> 01:39:58,608
You've kept this matter
quite in your own hands.

1096
01:39:58,609 --> 01:40:03,279
Will you tell me in the plainest
words of what it is you accuse me?

1097
01:40:05,574 --> 01:40:09,493
Of having prevented
Pansy's marriage to Warburton.

1098
01:40:09,494 --> 01:40:11,162
Are those words plain enough?

1099
01:40:11,163 --> 01:40:14,624
On the contrary,
I took great interest in it.

1100
01:40:14,791 --> 01:40:18,085
When you counted on me,
I accepted the obligation.

1101
01:40:18,253 --> 01:40:19,587
I was a fool, but I did it.

1102
01:40:20,714 --> 01:40:22,215
You pretended to do it.

1103
01:40:22,216 --> 01:40:25,301
Where is the letter
you told me he'd written?

1104
01:40:26,678 --> 01:40:28,179
I haven't the least idea.

1105
01:40:29,640 --> 01:40:31,849
No, you destroyed it.

1106
01:40:36,271 --> 01:40:39,148
Oh, Gilbert, for a man
who was so fine...

1107
01:40:39,149 --> 01:40:41,067
I was never so fine as you.

1108
01:40:41,068 --> 01:40:43,778
You've done everything
that you wanted.

1109
01:40:43,779 --> 01:40:46,614
You got him out of the way
without appearing to,

1110
01:40:46,615 --> 01:40:50,493
and you've placed me in the position
in which you wish to see me.

1111
01:40:50,494 --> 01:40:53,746
As a man who tried to marry
his daughter to a Lord,

1112
01:40:53,747 --> 01:40:55,414
but grotesquely failed.

1113
01:40:55,582 --> 01:40:58,876
- Pansy doesn't care for him.
- That has nothing to do with it!

1114
01:40:59,044 --> 01:41:03,464
- And he doesn't...
- That won't do! You told me he did!

1115
01:41:03,465 --> 01:41:07,176
After this, you must attend
to such things yourself.

1116
01:41:21,942 --> 01:41:25,403
I always thought you were
fond of my daughter.

1117
01:41:25,404 --> 01:41:28,572
I have never been more so than now.

1118
01:41:28,573 --> 01:41:31,325
Your affection has immense
limitations.

1119
01:41:31,326 --> 01:41:33,953
However, that, perhaps, is natural.

1120
01:41:33,954 --> 01:41:36,455
Is that all you wish to say to me?

1121
01:41:37,416 --> 01:41:40,293
Are you satisfied? Huh?

1122
01:41:42,170 --> 01:41:45,006
Am I sufficiently disappointed?

1123
01:41:45,007 --> 01:41:49,176
I don't think, on the whole,
you're disappointed.

1124
01:41:49,177 --> 01:41:52,888
You've had another opportunity
to try to stupefy me.

1125
01:42:04,192 --> 01:42:06,360
It's not that.

1126
01:42:07,779 --> 01:42:10,489
It's proved that Pansy can aim high.

1127
01:43:00,874 --> 01:43:04,794
I suppose you know you can't
go back to England alone.

1128
01:43:04,795 --> 01:43:09,757
(Clears throat) I had no idea of
doing that. I'll have people with me.

1129
01:43:09,758 --> 01:43:11,634
What do you mean by people?

1130
01:43:11,635 --> 01:43:13,719
Servants whom you pay?

1131
01:43:17,474 --> 01:43:19,683
After all, they're human beings.

1132
01:43:21,103 --> 01:43:23,562
I guess I'll go with you.

1133
01:43:23,563 --> 01:43:25,898
- (Clears throat) Go with me?
- Yes.

1134
01:43:26,066 --> 01:43:29,777
I know you don't like me
but I'll go with you.

1135
01:43:30,904 --> 01:43:33,823
And what's more,
I'll take care of you.

1136
01:43:36,743 --> 01:43:38,327
I like you very much.

1137
01:43:38,328 --> 01:43:40,955
You needn't think
you can buy me off.

1138
01:43:40,956 --> 01:43:44,333
I'm afraid I shall be
a fifth wheel to the coach.

1139
01:43:44,334 --> 01:43:46,961
Mrs. Osmond wants me
to travel with you.

1140
01:43:49,214 --> 01:43:51,841
But that isn't the principal thing.

1141
01:43:51,842 --> 01:43:55,261
The principal thing is
she wants me to leave Rome.

1142
01:43:56,680 --> 01:43:58,764
She wants us all to leave Rome.

1143
01:43:58,932 --> 01:44:00,891
(Speaking Italian )

1144
01:44:16,450 --> 01:44:18,659
It's wonderfully good of you.

1145
01:44:18,660 --> 01:44:21,370
I can't tell you how kind
I think you.

1146
01:44:22,747 --> 01:44:25,708
With a few words like that,
you make me go?

1147
01:44:25,709 --> 01:44:29,420
- You must come back someday.
- I don't care for your cousin.

1148
01:44:29,421 --> 01:44:31,505
Is that what you wish to tell me?

1149
01:44:31,506 --> 01:44:35,176
No. No, I don't want
to TELL you anything.

1150
01:44:36,636 --> 01:44:39,388
I can't understand.
What am I to believe?

1151
01:44:39,556 --> 01:44:41,891
What do you want me to think?

1152
01:44:42,058 --> 01:44:46,187
If you're happy, I'd like to know it.
That would be something for me.

1153
01:44:46,188 --> 01:44:47,771
You SAY you're happy,

1154
01:44:47,939 --> 01:44:49,940
and yet, somehow, you're so...

1155
01:44:50,108 --> 01:44:52,818
still, so smooth...

1156
01:44:52,819 --> 01:44:54,820
so hard.

1157
01:44:56,239 --> 01:44:59,825
You're completely changed.
You conceal everything.

1158
01:45:00,619 --> 01:45:04,330
- I haven't really come near you.
- You come very near.

1159
01:45:20,889 --> 01:45:23,933
You seem uncommonly glad
to get rid of us all.

1160
01:45:29,940 --> 01:45:31,649
My dear Ralph.

1161
01:45:35,028 --> 01:45:37,821
I've seen less of you
than I might have,

1162
01:45:37,822 --> 01:45:40,115
but it's been better than nothing.

1163
01:45:41,576 --> 01:45:43,786
I've heard a great deal about you.

1164
01:45:44,955 --> 01:45:48,666
I don't know from whom,
living the life you've done.

1165
01:45:49,709 --> 01:45:51,919
From the voices of the air.

1166
01:46:00,345 --> 01:46:02,388
You've been my best friend.

1167
01:46:06,977 --> 01:46:09,979
It was for you
that I wanted to live,

1168
01:46:09,980 --> 01:46:12,231
but I'm of no use to you.

1169
01:46:13,233 --> 01:46:15,067
(Speaking Italian )

1170
01:46:24,411 --> 01:46:26,745
If you should send for me...

1171
01:46:28,540 --> 01:46:30,165
I'd come.

1172
01:46:30,166 --> 01:46:32,710
Your husband
won't consent to that.

1173
01:46:32,711 --> 01:46:34,753
No, he won't like it,

1174
01:46:34,921 --> 01:46:37,548
but I might go all the same.

1175
01:46:43,430 --> 01:46:48,517
I'd hoped to find Lord Warburton here
and to be able to congratulate Pansy.

1176
01:46:48,685 --> 01:46:52,146
You shouldn't have gone to Naples,
but stayed to watch.

1177
01:46:52,314 --> 01:46:54,023
Is it too late?

1178
01:46:54,024 --> 01:46:56,358
It's all over. Please...

1179
01:46:56,359 --> 01:46:58,027
just let it rest.

1180
01:46:58,028 --> 01:47:01,697
I've no doubt Osmond will
happily discuss it with you.

1181
01:47:01,698 --> 01:47:05,909
Oh, I know what he thinks.
He came to see me last evening.

1182
01:47:08,580 --> 01:47:10,164
As soon as you arrived?

1183
01:47:13,084 --> 01:47:15,544
Your husband judges you severely.

1184
01:47:20,175 --> 01:47:23,177
Wait. Please.

1185
01:47:37,776 --> 01:47:40,694
I want, if possible,
to learn the truth.

1186
01:47:43,948 --> 01:47:46,075
What truth do you speak of?

1187
01:47:47,410 --> 01:47:50,079
Just this...

1188
01:47:52,082 --> 01:47:57,419
Whether Lord Warburton changed
his mind quite of his own accord

1189
01:47:57,420 --> 01:47:59,630
or because you recommended it.

1190
01:48:01,049 --> 01:48:04,301
To please himself,
I mean, or to please you?

1191
01:48:04,302 --> 01:48:07,221
Now, don't be unreasonable.

1192
01:48:07,389 --> 01:48:09,139
Don't take offence.

1193
01:48:13,937 --> 01:48:17,231
If Lord Warburton simply
got tired of the child,

1194
01:48:17,399 --> 01:48:19,817
that's one thing, and it's a pity.

1195
01:48:20,944 --> 01:48:23,987
But if he gave her up to please you,

1196
01:48:25,156 --> 01:48:27,408
that's another.

1197
01:48:27,409 --> 01:48:29,743
If that's the case...

1198
01:48:30,829 --> 01:48:32,830
let him off, let us have him.

1199
01:48:35,750 --> 01:48:37,501
Who are you?

1200
01:48:37,502 --> 01:48:39,795
Ah, you take it like that.

1201
01:48:40,797 --> 01:48:42,923
What have you to do with me?

1202
01:48:47,804 --> 01:48:49,430
Everything.

1203
01:48:57,188 --> 01:49:00,607
(Serena ) I would give my right hand
to be able to weep.

1204
01:49:00,608 --> 01:49:02,651
What good would it do you to weep?

1205
01:49:05,321 --> 01:49:07,239
It would make me feel...

1206
01:49:08,700 --> 01:49:10,701
as I felt before I knew you.

1207
01:49:15,749 --> 01:49:18,584
If I've dried up your tears,
that's something,

1208
01:49:18,585 --> 01:49:20,711
but I've seen you shed them.

1209
01:49:20,712 --> 01:49:24,339
You'll make me cry still,
make me howl like a wolf.

1210
01:49:25,508 --> 01:49:27,342
I've a great need of that.

1211
01:49:27,343 --> 01:49:30,471
I was vile this afternoon.
I was horrid.

1212
01:49:33,266 --> 01:49:36,310
You may have said things
that were in bad taste.

1213
01:49:36,478 --> 01:49:38,479
I was full of something bad...

1214
01:49:41,941 --> 01:49:45,569
or something good, I don't know,
I couldn't help it.

1215
01:49:50,325 --> 01:49:54,578
You've not only dried up my tears,
you've dried up my soul.

1216
01:49:54,579 --> 01:49:56,747
You're very bad.

1217
01:50:08,760 --> 01:50:10,552
Is this the way we're to end?

1218
01:50:14,349 --> 01:50:16,350
How do bad people end?

1219
01:50:18,603 --> 01:50:21,271
Especially as to their common crimes?

1220
01:50:24,400 --> 01:50:27,945
You have made me as bad as yourself.

1221
01:50:27,946 --> 01:50:30,239
You seem to me quite good enough.

1222
01:50:39,207 --> 01:50:41,291
Oh, God!

1223
01:50:41,292 --> 01:50:43,627
God!

1224
01:50:43,628 --> 01:50:45,420
(Screams )

1225
01:50:45,922 --> 01:50:48,298
So you're going to weep after all?

1226
01:50:48,299 --> 01:50:50,384
Have I ever complained to you?

1227
01:50:50,385 --> 01:50:54,596
Of course you haven't,
you've enjoyed your triumph too much.

1228
01:50:56,057 --> 01:50:59,101
You made your wife
afraid of you, she was...

1229
01:50:59,561 --> 01:51:03,856
She was afraid of me today,
but it was really you she feared.

1230
01:51:03,857 --> 01:51:06,900
This whole idea
didn't originate with me.

1231
01:51:06,901 --> 01:51:08,986
Your genius brought it about.

1232
01:51:08,987 --> 01:51:11,113
I only ask that my wife
should like me.

1233
01:51:11,781 --> 01:51:14,825
Oh, Jesus, she should
like you so much?

1234
01:51:14,826 --> 01:51:19,371
If you'll make a tragedy of that,
the tragedy is hardly for her.

1235
01:51:19,372 --> 01:51:21,415
It's for me.

1236
01:51:24,127 --> 01:51:27,296
I live with the consequences,
so must you.

1237
01:51:30,550 --> 01:51:33,844
Please be careful
with that precious object.

1238
01:51:33,845 --> 01:51:36,680
It already has a wee bit
of a tiny crack.

1239
01:51:45,273 --> 01:51:49,443
However, since my wife
doesn't like me,

1240
01:51:49,444 --> 01:51:52,446
I shall look for
compensation in Pansy.

1241
01:51:53,656 --> 01:51:56,825
Fortunately, I haven't a fault
to find with her.

1242
01:52:00,163 --> 01:52:02,164
(Children begging)

1243
01:52:03,458 --> 01:52:08,253
Mia! Listen to me. Oh! Leave me.

1244
01:52:14,552 --> 01:52:16,345
Pansy!

1245
01:52:22,060 --> 01:52:24,227
- Oh...
- Pansy.

1246
01:52:26,564 --> 01:52:29,149
Pansy? Pansy?

1247
01:52:30,068 --> 01:52:33,528
- Mrs. Osmond? Mrs. Osmond!
- Pansy.

1248
01:52:33,529 --> 01:52:35,781
Mrs. Osmond!

1249
01:52:35,782 --> 01:52:37,491
I've been in Paris!

1250
01:52:37,492 --> 01:52:39,451
I've sold my bibelots!

1251
01:52:39,452 --> 01:52:42,829
The result's magnificent, $50,000!

1252
01:52:43,873 --> 01:52:46,708
Will Mr. Osmond think me
rich enough now?

1253
01:52:50,546 --> 01:52:51,922
Oh...

1254
01:52:53,591 --> 01:52:59,554
Pipi... eat your food.
Very good. Pipi.

1255
01:53:00,264 --> 01:53:02,766
Oh.

1256
01:53:02,934 --> 01:53:04,935
(Speaking Italian )

1257
01:53:19,283 --> 01:53:21,284
Is Pansy not well?

1258
01:53:24,080 --> 01:53:25,956
No. She is quite well,

1259
01:53:25,957 --> 01:53:28,500
but I've sent her to the convent.

1260
01:53:28,501 --> 01:53:33,213
I didn't speak of it to you because
I doubt if I can make you understand.

1261
01:53:33,214 --> 01:53:36,425
One's daughter should be
fresh and fair.

1262
01:53:36,426 --> 01:53:40,387
Pansy's a little dusty,
a little dishevelled.

1263
01:53:40,388 --> 01:53:43,181
She'll have time to think,

1264
01:53:43,182 --> 01:53:46,476
and there's something I want her
to think about.

1265
01:53:46,644 --> 01:53:49,187
It's very absurd, my dear Osmond.

1266
01:53:49,188 --> 01:53:52,482
Why don't you just say
you want to get her out of my way?

1267
01:53:54,277 --> 01:53:56,653
My dear Amy, if that were the case,

1268
01:53:56,654 --> 01:53:59,573
it would be much simpler
to banish you.

1269
01:53:59,574 --> 01:54:02,784
( Amy ) You know I think
very well of Mr. Rosier.

1270
01:54:02,785 --> 01:54:04,327
I do, indeed.

1271
01:54:04,328 --> 01:54:07,247
He seems to be simpaticissimo.

1272
01:54:07,832 --> 01:54:11,334
He's made me believe in,
ah, true love.

1273
01:54:44,077 --> 01:54:47,662
Oh... Excuse me
for disturbing you.

1274
01:54:47,663 --> 01:54:50,707
When I come into your room,
I always knock.

1275
01:54:50,708 --> 01:54:52,584
I forgot.

1276
01:54:53,753 --> 01:54:56,922
I had something else to think of.

1277
01:54:56,923 --> 01:54:58,715
My cousin's dying.

1278
01:54:59,634 --> 01:55:01,635
I don't believe that.

1279
01:55:01,636 --> 01:55:04,805
He was dying when we married.
He'll outlive us all.

1280
01:55:04,806 --> 01:55:06,640
My aunt telegraphed for me.

1281
01:55:08,601 --> 01:55:10,602
I must go to England.

1282
01:55:11,562 --> 01:55:16,733
- I don't see the need of it.
- I must see Ralph before he dies.

1283
01:55:18,236 --> 01:55:20,946
I shall not like it if you do.

1284
01:55:20,947 --> 01:55:22,948
You won't like it if I don't.

1285
01:55:25,368 --> 01:55:27,494
You like nothing I do or don't do.

1286
01:55:29,956 --> 01:55:32,207
You pretend to think I lie.

1287
01:55:36,754 --> 01:55:38,964
That's why you go, then?

1288
01:55:38,965 --> 01:55:42,843
Not to see your cousin,
but to take revenge on me?

1289
01:55:45,138 --> 01:55:48,557
You wish immensely
I would commit some folly.

1290
01:55:54,689 --> 01:55:59,067
If you leave Rome today, it will be
an act of the most deliberate,

1291
01:55:59,068 --> 01:56:01,528
the most calculated opposition.

1292
01:56:02,989 --> 01:56:05,866
I can't tell you
how unjust you seem to me.

1293
01:56:08,077 --> 01:56:11,163
It's your own opposition
that's calculated.

1294
01:56:12,707 --> 01:56:14,499
It's malignant.

1295
01:56:27,138 --> 01:56:31,099
I have an ideal of what my wife
should do and should not do.

1296
01:56:31,100 --> 01:56:36,313
She should not travel across Europe
to sit at the bedside of other men.

1297
01:56:36,480 --> 01:56:40,108
Your cousin is nothing to you.
He's nothing to us.

1298
01:56:41,152 --> 01:56:45,572
You smile most expressively
when I talk about us,

1299
01:56:45,573 --> 01:56:48,575
but I assure you that we...

1300
01:56:48,576 --> 01:56:50,785
we, Mrs. Osmond...

1301
01:56:53,664 --> 01:56:55,665
is all I know.

1302
01:56:59,629 --> 01:57:03,798
You are nearer to me
than any other human creature,

1303
01:57:03,799 --> 01:57:06,176
and I am nearer to you.

1304
01:57:06,177 --> 01:57:08,720
It may be a disagreeable proximity,

1305
01:57:08,721 --> 01:57:11,973
but it is one of our own
deliberate making.

1306
01:57:13,392 --> 01:57:16,895
You don't like to be
reminded of that, I know...

1307
01:57:18,439 --> 01:57:21,233
but I am
perfectly willing, because...

1308
01:57:23,110 --> 01:57:27,822
because I believe we should accept
the consequences of our actions...

1309
01:57:29,492 --> 01:57:33,787
and what I value most in life
is the honour of the thing.

1310
01:58:20,209 --> 01:58:22,419
Oh! My dear.

1311
01:58:22,420 --> 01:58:25,046
Do tell me some amusing book to read.

1312
01:58:25,047 --> 01:58:26,715
Would this do me any good?

1313
01:58:28,551 --> 01:58:30,802
My cousin, Ralph Touchett, is dying.

1314
01:58:30,970 --> 01:58:35,140
Oh... He was so simpatico.

1315
01:58:35,308 --> 01:58:37,809
I'm awfully sorry for you.

1316
01:58:40,730 --> 01:58:42,314
You look very badly.

1317
01:58:42,315 --> 01:58:45,775
Osmond says it's impossible
I should go to England.

1318
01:58:45,776 --> 01:58:49,529
And why does Osmond say
it's impossible?

1319
01:58:49,530 --> 01:58:51,823
Because we're so happy together

1320
01:58:51,824 --> 01:58:54,784
that we can't separate,
even for a fortnight.

1321
01:59:24,231 --> 01:59:26,107
You're very unhappy.

1322
01:59:28,652 --> 01:59:30,195
Yes.

1323
01:59:31,822 --> 01:59:34,616
But I don't think you can comfort me.

1324
01:59:35,868 --> 01:59:38,787
Will you give me leave to try?

1325
01:59:38,788 --> 01:59:42,123
There is something
I want you to know.

1326
01:59:43,667 --> 01:59:47,337
Perhaps you do.
Perhaps you've guessed it.

1327
01:59:47,338 --> 01:59:52,425
Oh, in your place
I should have guessed it ages ago.

1328
01:59:52,426 --> 01:59:54,594
Have you never really suspected?

1329
01:59:58,766 --> 02:00:00,809
Suspected what?

1330
02:00:00,810 --> 02:00:03,436
My first sister-in-law
had no children.

1331
02:00:06,899 --> 02:00:11,361
The poor woman was married hardly
three years and died childless.

1332
02:00:14,990 --> 02:00:17,575
Pansy's not my husband's child, then?

1333
02:00:17,576 --> 02:00:21,871
Oh, your husband's in perfection,
but not his wife's.

1334
02:00:22,957 --> 02:00:27,460
Oh, my dear Isabel,
with you, one must dot one's I's.

1335
02:00:27,461 --> 02:00:29,462
Whose child?

1336
02:00:29,463 --> 02:00:34,092
Oh, she's been wonderfully clever,
magnificent about Pansy.

1337
02:00:34,093 --> 02:00:36,261
(Gasping and sobbing)

1338
02:00:40,808 --> 02:00:43,101
Had it never occurred to you

1339
02:00:43,102 --> 02:00:47,272
that Serena Merle
was for six or seven years his lover?

1340
02:00:52,194 --> 02:00:54,404
At last you understand.

1341
02:01:28,522 --> 02:01:30,106
(Speaking Italian )

1342
02:01:36,280 --> 02:01:38,490
You're surprised to find me here.

1343
02:01:39,783 --> 02:01:42,494
And I'm afraid you're not pleased.

1344
02:01:46,123 --> 02:01:50,877
I confess I've been indiscreet,
I ought to have asked permission.

1345
02:01:55,257 --> 02:01:57,258
I came to see Pansy.

1346
02:01:58,594 --> 02:02:02,722
It occurred to me this afternoon
that she must be rather lonely.

1347
02:02:13,901 --> 02:02:15,860
That it's a little dismal.

1348
02:02:20,366 --> 02:02:22,575
So I came, on...

1349
02:02:26,372 --> 02:02:28,373
the chance...

1350
02:02:43,472 --> 02:02:45,473
(Nun speaking Italian )

1351
02:03:15,337 --> 02:03:17,880
Don't you think I've made it pretty?

1352
02:03:17,881 --> 02:03:21,551
Yes. It seems... it seems comfortable.

1353
02:03:24,388 --> 02:03:27,181
I've come to bid you goodbye.

1354
02:03:27,349 --> 02:03:29,350
I'm going to England.

1355
02:03:35,149 --> 02:03:37,108
Not to come back?

1356
02:03:38,485 --> 02:03:40,486
My cousin is very ill.

1357
02:03:45,451 --> 02:03:47,577
Don't leave me here.

1358
02:03:47,578 --> 02:03:50,288
Will you come with me now?

1359
02:03:50,289 --> 02:03:52,624
Did Papa tell you to ask me that?

1360
02:03:53,626 --> 02:03:55,627
No. It's my own proposal.

1361
02:04:00,758 --> 02:04:02,842
I had better wait, then.

1362
02:04:04,053 --> 02:04:07,889
He thinks I have not
had enough, but I have.

1363
02:04:08,057 --> 02:04:12,560
He wished me to think a little,
and I have thought a great deal.

1364
02:04:12,561 --> 02:04:14,896
What have you thought?

1365
02:04:15,064 --> 02:04:17,482
That I must never displease Papa.

1366
02:04:20,861 --> 02:04:23,529
Grazie.

1367
02:04:27,326 --> 02:04:30,203
- (Gasps )
- I found I wished to wait for you.

1368
02:04:30,204 --> 02:04:32,705
But it's not to talk about Pansy.

1369
02:04:32,706 --> 02:04:34,957
Are you very fond of your cousin?

1370
02:04:34,958 --> 02:04:38,711
- I don't understand you.
- It's hard to explain.

1371
02:04:41,340 --> 02:04:44,550
Your cousin once did you
a great service. Have you...

1372
02:04:44,551 --> 02:04:46,094
never guessed it?

1373
02:04:46,095 --> 02:04:48,096
He made you rich.

1374
02:04:50,849 --> 02:04:52,558
He made me?

1375
02:04:52,559 --> 02:04:56,688
It was your uncle's money,
but it was your cousin's idea.

1376
02:04:56,689 --> 02:04:58,898
He brought his father over to it.

1377
02:04:58,899 --> 02:05:01,776
I don't know why
you say such things.

1378
02:05:01,777 --> 02:05:06,823
- I don't know how you know.
- I know only what I've guessed,

1379
02:05:06,824 --> 02:05:09,992
and I've guessed that.

1380
02:05:09,993 --> 02:05:13,079
At bottom, it's him you've to thank.

1381
02:05:13,080 --> 02:05:15,790
I believed it was you I had to thank.

1382
02:05:20,045 --> 02:05:22,380
You're very unhappy, I know.

1383
02:05:22,381 --> 02:05:25,174
But I'm more so.

1384
02:05:32,057 --> 02:05:33,808
(Thunder)

1385
02:06:14,725 --> 02:06:18,603
Hello. Isn't it wonderful she's come?

1386
02:06:20,856 --> 02:06:23,399
- How was the channel?
- Very fine.

1387
02:06:25,110 --> 02:06:26,611
No.

1388
02:06:27,696 --> 02:06:29,822
No, I believe it was very rough.

1389
02:07:17,246 --> 02:07:18,788
(Dogs barking)

1390
02:07:20,040 --> 02:07:22,583
(Isabel) Will he see me?

1391
02:07:22,584 --> 02:07:24,710
Can he speak to me?

1392
02:07:24,711 --> 02:07:27,088
(Mrs. Touchett) You can try him.

1393
02:07:27,089 --> 02:07:30,591
- Is there really no hope?
- None whatsoever.

1394
02:07:30,592 --> 02:07:32,593
There never has been.

1395
02:07:49,403 --> 02:07:51,571
(Muttering)

1396
02:09:04,561 --> 02:09:06,729
It's very good of you to come.

1397
02:09:09,566 --> 02:09:12,234
I thought you would,
but I wasn't sure.

1398
02:09:12,235 --> 02:09:13,986
I wasn't sure, either...

1399
02:09:15,280 --> 02:09:17,323
till I came.

1400
02:09:21,620 --> 02:09:24,038
With me it's all over.

1401
02:09:27,250 --> 02:09:29,251
Isabel...

1402
02:09:33,298 --> 02:09:35,675
I wish it were over for you.

1403
02:09:41,348 --> 02:09:44,517
What is it you have done
for me in leaving Rome?

1404
02:09:46,812 --> 02:09:49,063
What is it you did for me?

1405
02:09:51,358 --> 02:09:53,526
You did something once.

1406
02:09:54,611 --> 02:09:56,779
You know it.

1407
02:09:59,199 --> 02:10:01,158
Oh...

1408
02:10:03,036 --> 02:10:05,037
Ralph.

1409
02:10:05,205 --> 02:10:07,373
Keep me in your heart.

1410
02:10:07,374 --> 02:10:10,418
I shall be nearer to you
than I've ever been.

1411
02:10:11,420 --> 02:10:16,382
(Sobbing) I never thanked you.

1412
02:10:16,383 --> 02:10:18,843
I... I never spoke.

1413
02:10:20,053 --> 02:10:22,471
I never was what I should be.

1414
02:10:24,182 --> 02:10:26,892
Yet how could I know?
I only know today

1415
02:10:26,893 --> 02:10:30,396
because there are people
less stupid than I.

1416
02:10:30,397 --> 02:10:32,648
Don't mind people.

1417
02:10:38,613 --> 02:10:41,032
Is it true?

1418
02:10:41,199 --> 02:10:43,367
That you've been stupid?

1419
02:10:44,411 --> 02:10:46,245
No.

1420
02:10:47,998 --> 02:10:50,624
He married me for the money.

1421
02:10:56,048 --> 02:10:58,799
I only want you to understand.

1422
02:10:58,800 --> 02:11:02,053
I always tried
to keep you from understanding.

1423
02:11:04,097 --> 02:11:06,390
But that's all over.

1424
02:11:10,562 --> 02:11:12,938
Was he very bad about your coming?

1425
02:11:12,939 --> 02:11:15,399
He made it very hard for me...

1426
02:11:15,400 --> 02:11:17,359
but I don't care.

1427
02:11:17,944 --> 02:11:21,530
Here... with you...

1428
02:11:24,159 --> 02:11:27,203
I'm happier than I've been
in a long time.

1429
02:11:29,706 --> 02:11:33,084
I want you to be happy.

1430
02:11:33,085 --> 02:11:35,086
To feel that I'm near you.

1431
02:11:38,632 --> 02:11:41,050
That I love you.

1432
02:11:44,221 --> 02:11:46,263
Why should there be pain?

1433
02:11:47,432 --> 02:11:49,558
That's not the deepest thing.

1434
02:12:02,823 --> 02:12:05,032
You must stay here.

1435
02:12:10,413 --> 02:12:12,331
Pain's deep...

1436
02:12:13,166 --> 02:12:16,293
but it... passes, after all.

1437
02:12:16,294 --> 02:12:18,254
- It's passing now.
- Oh...

1438
02:12:18,255 --> 02:12:20,297
But love remains.

1439
02:12:23,969 --> 02:12:26,887
I don't know why
we should suffer so much,

1440
02:12:26,888 --> 02:12:28,639
perhaps I should find out.

1441
02:12:30,350 --> 02:12:31,934
Shh...

1442
02:12:37,566 --> 02:12:39,525
I don't believe...

1443
02:12:43,155 --> 02:12:46,490
I don't believe
such a generous mistake as yours

1444
02:12:46,658 --> 02:12:49,076
can hurt you
for more than a little.

1445
02:12:51,872 --> 02:12:54,248
And remember this...

1446
02:12:54,249 --> 02:12:56,500
that if you have been hated,

1447
02:12:56,501 --> 02:12:58,502
you've also been loved.

1448
02:13:01,464 --> 02:13:04,133
Oh, but, Isabel...

1449
02:13:07,095 --> 02:13:09,263
..adored.

1450
02:14:25,131 --> 02:14:27,675
(Minister) Man that is born of woman

1451
02:14:27,676 --> 02:14:31,887
has but a short time to live
and is full of misery.

1452
02:14:31,888 --> 02:14:34,932
He cometh up and is cut down
like a flower.

1453
02:14:34,933 --> 02:14:40,479
He fleeth as it were a shadow
and never continueth upon this day.

1454
02:14:40,480 --> 02:14:43,023
In the midst of life
we are in death.

1455
02:14:43,024 --> 02:14:46,318
Of whom may we seek for succour
but of thee, o Lord,

1456
02:14:46,319 --> 02:14:49,863
who for our sins
art justly mispleased?

1457
02:15:08,717 --> 02:15:10,551
(Whispering) I adore him.

1458
02:15:12,595 --> 02:15:28,402
I adore him.

1459
02:15:29,237 --> 02:15:31,530
(Gasps ) Oh.

1460
02:15:33,533 --> 02:15:35,326
You frightened me.

1461
02:15:42,000 --> 02:15:44,335
I wanted to see you alone.

1462
02:15:44,336 --> 02:15:48,172
So I've been waiting and,
uh, walking about.

1463
02:15:54,262 --> 02:15:57,973
I don't wish to trouble you
as I did in Rome.

1464
02:15:57,974 --> 02:16:00,809
That was no use.
It only distressed you.

1465
02:16:00,810 --> 02:16:03,854
I knew I was wrong.

1466
02:16:03,855 --> 02:16:05,898
But I'm not wrong now.

1467
02:16:05,899 --> 02:16:09,068
It's very different now.
I can help you.

1468
02:16:09,069 --> 02:16:11,445
How can you help me?

1469
02:16:13,740 --> 02:16:17,284
It was good when you made me
come away with your cousin.

1470
02:16:17,285 --> 02:16:20,371
He was a good man. A fine man.

1471
02:16:22,374 --> 02:16:24,917
He told me how the case
stands for you.

1472
02:16:24,918 --> 02:16:27,211
He explained everything.

1473
02:16:27,379 --> 02:16:29,630
He guessed my sentiments.

1474
02:16:38,515 --> 02:16:42,559
Do you know what he told me here
the last time I saw him?

1475
02:16:42,560 --> 02:16:45,396
He said,
"Do everything you can for her."

1476
02:16:47,273 --> 02:16:49,316
"Everything she'll let you."

1477
02:16:51,945 --> 02:16:54,446
You had no business to talk of me.

1478
02:16:54,447 --> 02:16:56,156
Why not?

1479
02:16:56,157 --> 02:16:59,660
Why not, when we talked
in that way? He was dying.

1480
02:17:06,292 --> 02:17:09,336
It's too late to play a part.

1481
02:17:10,547 --> 02:17:14,091
Touchett knew and I knew
what it cost you to come here.

1482
02:17:14,259 --> 02:17:17,678
It will cost you your life.

1483
02:17:17,679 --> 02:17:20,681
Give me one word of truth.

1484
02:17:20,682 --> 02:17:22,683
You're afraid to go back.

1485
02:17:26,312 --> 02:17:29,231
You're perfectly alone.

1486
02:17:29,232 --> 02:17:31,442
Now I want you to think of me.

1487
02:17:33,486 --> 02:17:36,196
- To think of you.
- Turn to me.

1488
02:17:37,198 --> 02:17:38,991
Why should you go back?

1489
02:17:38,992 --> 02:17:41,452
Why go through that ghastly form?

1490
02:17:41,453 --> 02:17:44,329
- To get away from you.
- I want to prevent that!

1491
02:17:51,087 --> 02:17:54,923
If you'd only for once listen to me.

1492
02:17:55,091 --> 02:17:57,092
Why shouldn't we be happy?

1493
02:17:57,302 --> 02:18:02,723
Why? Why, when it's here
before us? When it's so easy?

1494
02:18:02,724 --> 02:18:05,184
We can do absolutely as we please.

1495
02:18:05,185 --> 02:18:08,687
To whom under the sun
do we owe anything?

1496
02:18:11,107 --> 02:18:13,358
I beg you to go away.

1497
02:18:15,653 --> 02:18:18,071
Don't say that, don't kill me.
