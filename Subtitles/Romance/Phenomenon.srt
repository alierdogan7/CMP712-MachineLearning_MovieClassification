your responses.

Any questions?

- What's your first name?
- Uh, my first name is Bob.

Hmm. Sixty seconds.

Well, how would you like that?
How about alphabetical?

Now, varmint is a stretch.
So is Newfoundland.

That's a dog breed.

make that pencil move?

Is that a trick pencil?

No. I ask it to move.

1026

I mean, I could say
that I will it,

1027
01:07:55,985 --> 01:07:59,284
but that would be
more like a command.

1028
01:07:59,355 --> 01:08:03,655
This is more like
a collaboration, a partnership.

- Mm-hmm.

not the point. Mr.Malley has

and some backward ones.

1300
01:26:30,926 --> 01:26:35,590
You know, I-I can really only tell you
what I've read in these books.

1301
01:26:35,664 --> 01:26:39,065
- He looks better.
- Yeah. Yeah. He does.

1302
01:26:39,135 --> 01:26:43,162
[ George ] I seem to have an increased
capacity for-- for learning.

1303
01:26:43,239 --> 01:26:45,571
- Right now.
- How do we know you've read
all these books?

1304
01:26:45,641 --> 01:26:48,667
Well, um, ask me
something. Uh--

1305
01:26:48,744 --> 01:26:52,180
I'd be-- I'd be glad to answer
any question that you have, or--

1306
01:26:52,248 --> 01:26:56,116
How did you break that mirror, George,
without even touching it?

1307
01:26:56,185 --> 01:26:59,348
Now, I want to talk to you
about that, Banes,

1308
01:26:59,422 --> 01:27:03,256
because I know-- I know you've
been worried about it, and, um--

1309
01:27:03,325 --> 01:27:06,317
Okay. Come here. Come here.
Everybody gather closely.

1310
01:27:06,395 --> 01:27:08,625
I'm gonna--
May I use your glasses?

1311
01:27:11,033 --> 01:27:14,332
What you're about to see is not
a trick. Okay? I-It's just, um--

1312
01:27:14,403 --> 01:27:16,394
Well, l-let's just call it
an experiment in energy.

1313
01:27:16,472 --> 01:27:18,440
Cool!

1314
01:27:18,507 --> 01:27:20,372
- [ George ]
Well, everything there is...
- You getting this?

1315
01:27:20,443 --> 01:27:22,911
is made up of some
living energy, okay?

1316
01:27:22,978 --> 01:27:25,708
See, now, all this is--
is, uh-- is kind of a dance...

1317
01:27:25,781 --> 01:27:29,342
or partnership between
the energy coming from me...

1318
01:27:29,418 --> 01:27:31,716
and the, uh, energy
of the plastic.

1319
01:27:31,787 --> 01:27:34,813
- Now-- Now, th-th-that's it.
- Well, why can't we do it?

1320
01:27:34,890 --> 01:27:38,986
Well, focus. Um, uh,
clarity of thought.

1321
01:27:39,061 --> 01:27:41,086
I-I don't know.
M-Maybe you can, Banes.

1322
01:27:41,163 --> 01:27:43,324
What about the UFOs?
What are they?

1323
01:27:43,399 --> 01:27:46,664
- I don't know that either.
- Yes, you do. Yes, you do!

1324
01:27:46,735 --> 01:27:51,138
Um, this power began the night
that you saw the object in the sky.

1325
01:27:51,207 --> 01:27:54,836
Th-That-- That was a light.
Now-- Now, let me just finish
this one thing.

1326
01:27:54,910 --> 01:27:56,969
N-Now, we're talking
about a partnership.

1327
01:27:57,046 --> 01:28:01,983
Do you-- Do you know what the largest
living organism in the world is?

1328
01:28:02,051 --> 01:28:06,511
Okay. It's a grove of aspen trees
in Colorado, acres of aspens.

1329
01:28:06,589 --> 01:28:09,251
Okay. Now, they thought
they were disconnected, separate.

1330
01:28:09,325 --> 01:28:11,350
But, indeed, they found out
that they weren't.

1331
01:28:11,427 --> 01:28:14,692
That-- That there was one giant organism
with the same root system.

1332
01:28:14,763 --> 01:28:17,425
Uh, what sort of light was it?

1333
01:28:17,500 --> 01:28:20,025
- Now-- Now, that's not unlike us.
- [ Man ] Answer the question!

1334
01:28:20,102 --> 01:28:23,128
- We think that-- that--
- Why won't you tell us what you
know about the UFOs?

1335
01:28:23,205 --> 01:28:26,038
- Can you move the table?
- [ Reporter ] How did you feel
when you saw that light?

1336
01:28:26,108 --> 01:28:29,544
- I think you know more
than you're telling us!
- Now, imagine--

1337
01:28:29,612 --> 01:28:32,342
Have you seen the light
since the 28th?

Are you hiding something?
- [ Man ] Hey! Come on!

- It was aliens.
- Move the glasses some more!

- We know what you can do.

- Leave George alone!
- Touch the boy!
- Please, he's dying.

of any more tests to give me?

How did you, uh, manage
to get your pressure to come down?

1354
01:30:04,379 --> 01:30:08,247
Oh, I found my pace.

Why, you figure
I'm too thick?

What I figure about you...

1358
01:30:16,692 --> 01:30:19,525
is that you're stalling.

01:30:47,756 --> 01:30:49,690
George. George.

1367
01:30:51,793 --> 01:30:53,761
There's a tumor
in your brain...

1368
01:30:53,829 --> 01:30:57,060
- [ Scoffs ]
- that's spread out like a hand.

1369

Threads of it,
you know, everywhere.

1370
01:30:59,534 --> 01:31:02,435
But instead of dysfunction--
Now, here's the mystery, George.

1371
01:31:02,504 --> 01:31:05,905
Instead of destroying
brain function,

1372
01:31:05,974 --> 01:31:08,272
so far, it's been stimulating it.

1373
01:31:08,343 --> 01:31:11,471
And we can't understand that.

1374
01:31:11,546 --> 01:31:15,038
You have more area of active brain use
than anybody ever tested.

1375
01:31:15,117 --> 01:31:18,143
Ever. B-Because
of those tentacles.

1376
01:31:18,220 --> 01:31:22,987
I mean, we've seen tumors
like this before.
It's called astrocytoma.

1377
01:31:23,058 --> 01:31:27,188
And it explains the--
the dizziness and...

1378
01:31:27,262 --> 01:31:31,358
the illusion of light.

1379
01:31:31,433 --> 01:31:33,867
But the way it's in there,
waking up areas of the brain,

1380
01:31:33,935 --> 01:31:36,733
it's a...

1381
01:31:38,807 --> 01:31:42,072
big mystery, so--

1382
01:31:42,144 --> 01:31:44,772
And it's killing me.

- Well, uh--
- For sure?

to call it. But, uh--

01:35:26,259 --> 01:35:28,591
A dialogue.

01:35:28,662 --> 01:35:33,531
I'm going to ask for your permission for
my team to perform open-brain surgery.

1435
01:35:33,600 --> 01:35:36,125
- [ Murmurs ]
- But I don't want you to answer...

01:35:36,202 --> 01:35:39,968
- 'til we've had our dialogue.
- B-B-But y-you said
that this tumor was inoperable.

1437
01:35:40,040 --> 01:35:42,600
I think the odds
are very small,

1438
01:35:42,676 --> 01:35:44,940

in five hundred,

1439
01:35:45,011 --> 01:35:48,538
that we'd be able to remove enough
of the tumor to even prolong your life.

1440
01:35:48,615 --> 01:35:51,083
- Well, why-- why--
- But what I want to explain...

1441
01:35:51,151 --> 01:35:55,053
is that this would not be
a lifesaving operation.

1442
01:35:55,121 --> 01:35:58,557
[ Inhales ]
This would be--

1443
01:35:58,625 --> 01:36:01,594
Call it an expedition.

1444
01:36:03,129 --> 01:36:06,895
This would be a voyage
of discovery.

1445
01:36:06,966 --> 01:36:09,992
You're in a position to contribute
as much to our knowledge...

1446
01:36:10,070 --> 01:36:12,766
as any man or woman
who's come before you.

1447
01:36:15,508 --> 01:36:18,671
And if you were to wait,
and, uh, do this operation...

1448
01:36:18,745 --> 01:36:21,270
after I'm done with my brain,
what would, uh--

1449
01:36:21,348 --> 01:36:24,784
If that's what you want, yes,
an autopsy. That's all we'll do.

1450
01:36:24,851 --> 01:36:26,785
But that wouldn't be
as useful.

1451
01:36:26,853 --> 01:36:31,415
The study of a living,
active brain would tell us volumes.

1452
01:36:31,491 --> 01:36:34,016
All right, so, if you were
to do this operation, wouldn't
it most likely kill me...

1453
01:36:34,094 --> 01:36:36,028
or at least shorten my life?

1454
01:36:36,096 --> 01:36:40,931

and see the larger picture.

And have a little faith in me

1623
01:51:26,309 --> 01:51:31,406
And when the tears you cry

1624

Are all you can believe

1625
01:51:38,354 --> 01:51:44,953

Huh-uh.
Are you?

1635
01:52:41,650 --> 01:52:46,144
No. And I don't want to sleep
unless you're sleeping.

Wh--

He left these for you.

1656
01:54:57,753 --> 01:55:00,847
He said they're not finished.

1657
01:55:00,923 --> 01:55:02,857
You'll have to do it.

1658
01:55:07,229 --> 01:55:09,356
I'll do my best.

Pull one down for you

I was thinkin' out loud

1697
02:00:01,865 --> 02:00:06,768
One life's such a short time
for love

1698
02:00:06,836 --> 02:00:11,170
When a match made in heaven
arrives

1699

And make every second
your last

1720
02:01:47,470 --> 02:01:51,839
And I'll touch you
A full moon shall wake you

1721
