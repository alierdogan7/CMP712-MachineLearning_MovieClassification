1
00:00:02,835 --> 00:00:05,269
Thanks for the kiss.
It taught me a lot.

2
00:00:05,304 --> 00:00:07,438
Like what?
Like just because someone's

3
00:00:07,473 --> 00:00:09,674
sexually attracted to you doesn't
mean they really love you.

4
00:00:09,708 --> 00:00:11,342
I think Adrian and I
should get engaged.

5
00:00:11,377 --> 00:00:13,211
Not married, just engaged.

6
00:00:13,245 --> 00:00:15,213
I think it'll be nice,
especially for her,

7
00:00:15,247 --> 00:00:16,814
if people think
that we're engaged.

8
00:00:16,849 --> 00:00:19,317
Grace, you and Grant
aren't having sex, are you?

9
00:00:19,351 --> 00:00:20,651
I'm thinking about it.

10
00:00:20,686 --> 00:00:22,820
I don't want you
to have gateway sex.

11
00:00:22,855 --> 00:00:24,389
But, mom, I really like him.

12
00:00:24,423 --> 00:00:26,991
I should think you may be ready
to make a commitment.

13
00:00:27,026 --> 00:00:30,561
I just said I slept with another
woman after telling Amy I wouldn't.

14
00:00:30,596 --> 00:00:32,697
You wanna have a little fun?

15
00:00:32,731 --> 00:00:34,832
No. I don't do this anymore.

16
00:00:34,867 --> 00:00:38,536
One more time before the
girlfriend comes back home?

17
00:00:38,570 --> 00:00:40,838
Madison's dad isn't gonna
let us go out all summer.

18
00:00:40,873 --> 00:00:44,375
You can't stand the thought of my being with
someone else even though you have somebody else.

19
00:00:44,410 --> 00:00:45,743
I wanna do the right thing

20
00:00:45,778 --> 00:00:48,513
in case someday
you wanna get engaged.

21
00:00:48,547 --> 00:00:50,915
Friends?
Friends.

22
00:00:50,949 --> 00:00:52,550
What happened?
What are you doing here?

23
00:00:52,584 --> 00:00:54,852
More important to see you
before anything happens...

24
00:00:54,887 --> 00:00:56,354
anything that would
keep us apart.

25
00:01:03,228 --> 00:01:05,029
Hey.

26
00:01:06,398 --> 00:01:08,633
You didn't have to do that.
I had to do that.

27
00:01:08,667 --> 00:01:10,635
I know what they have to eat
on those flights.

28
00:01:10,669 --> 00:01:12,270
You have to be hungry.
It's almost 11:00.

29
00:01:12,304 --> 00:01:15,440
I should've just said
I'm starving. Thank you.

30
00:01:15,474 --> 00:01:16,908
[Chuckles]

31
00:01:20,379 --> 00:01:21,879
You gonna have something, too?

32
00:01:21,914 --> 00:01:23,214
I'm not hungry.

33
00:01:23,248 --> 00:01:25,416
What'd you have for dinner?

34
00:01:25,451 --> 00:01:27,151
Same thing. Sandwich.

35
00:01:27,186 --> 00:01:28,653
I went over to my apartment

36
00:01:28,687 --> 00:01:30,555
and started getting things
ready to move back in,

37
00:01:30,589 --> 00:01:32,590
so I just had a sandwich
from the butcher shop.

38
00:01:32,624 --> 00:01:34,258
Oh?

39
00:01:34,293 --> 00:01:36,260
Yeah.
What do you mean, "oh?"

40
00:01:36,295 --> 00:01:38,096
Don't you believe me?

41
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:41,399
Well, I believe you,
or I wanna believe you,

42
00:01:41,433 --> 00:01:43,401
but I just can't picture
what you'd be doing

43
00:01:43,435 --> 00:01:45,236
at your apartment
to get ready to move back in.

44
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:47,705
Just stuff.
I cleaned up.

45
00:01:47,739 --> 00:01:51,609
I'm not over there every day,
so there was stuff to clean up.

46
00:01:51,643 --> 00:01:53,244
I see.

47
00:01:53,278 --> 00:01:54,979
I don't think you do see.

48
00:01:55,013 --> 00:01:56,914
What stuff was there
to clean up?

49
00:01:56,949 --> 00:01:58,249
What were you doing, dusting?

50
00:01:58,283 --> 00:01:59,951
I might've been.
I dust.

51
00:01:59,985 --> 00:02:01,085
Do you?

52
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:03,321
Amy, I can't just hang out here

53
00:02:03,355 --> 00:02:05,123
all day and all night
with your family.

54
00:02:05,157 --> 00:02:08,159
I can't. I've done
the best I can, all right?

55
00:02:08,193 --> 00:02:10,895
And if you wanna accuse me
of having sex with another girl,

56
00:02:10,929 --> 00:02:12,463
just come out and say it.

57
00:02:12,498 --> 00:02:14,432
Just come out and say
what you're thinking.

58
00:02:14,466 --> 00:02:16,968
You know I've been working
on that the last few weeks.

59
00:02:17,002 --> 00:02:18,803
Yes, I know.
You told me.

60
00:02:24,309 --> 00:02:26,477
I've been listening
to all the teenage mothers

61
00:02:26,512 --> 00:02:28,679
and their stories about
how their boyfriends reacted

62
00:02:28,714 --> 00:02:30,715
once they decided
they wanted a real commitment

63
00:02:30,749 --> 00:02:32,116
and not just a promise
to help out.

64
00:02:32,151 --> 00:02:33,985
Well, I'm not their boyfriend.

65
00:02:34,019 --> 00:02:36,087
You're not even my boyfriend.

66
00:02:36,121 --> 00:02:40,358
I want you to be my boyfriend,
but you know that, so...

67
00:02:40,392 --> 00:02:43,427
What I'm thinking is

68
00:02:43,462 --> 00:02:45,429
maybe you went out and had sex

69
00:02:45,464 --> 00:02:47,131
with anyone you could
have sex with

70
00:02:47,166 --> 00:02:49,467
just because you knew you only
had a week until I got home.

71
00:02:49,501 --> 00:02:52,303
And maybe I didn't.
But I can if I want.

72
00:02:52,337 --> 00:02:53,804
Yeah, I guess.

73
00:02:53,839 --> 00:02:57,041
I didn't say I wasn't
gonna have sex with other girls.

74
00:02:57,075 --> 00:02:59,277
You said I'd have to quit
having sex with other girls

75
00:02:59,311 --> 00:03:01,112
if I wanna have sex with you.

76
00:03:01,146 --> 00:03:03,781
Maybe I don't wanna have sex with you.
No offense.

77
00:03:03,815 --> 00:03:07,485
Maybe I'm just not ready to be in
an exclusive relationship with you.

78
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:10,221
I... I didn't say I was ready
to do that... just be with you.

79
00:03:10,255 --> 00:03:12,223
All right.
Maybe you're not, and maybe you are.

80
00:03:12,257 --> 00:03:13,958
Just keep your voice down.

81
00:03:13,992 --> 00:03:15,693
I don't wanna wake up
everyone in the house.

82
00:03:15,727 --> 00:03:19,030
Look, you're tired.
It's late.

83
00:03:19,097 --> 00:03:21,332
You go to bed, and I'll just
go home to my apartment.

84
00:03:25,170 --> 00:03:26,637
[Sighs]

85
00:03:26,672 --> 00:03:29,040
You wanna fit one more girl in
before we finish this discussion?

86
00:03:29,074 --> 00:03:30,875
How do you do it?

87
00:03:30,909 --> 00:03:33,077
How do you just go out
at midnight,

88
00:03:33,111 --> 00:03:34,412
or whatever time it is,

89
00:03:34,446 --> 00:03:37,515
and find some girl to go home
and have sex with you?

90
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:40,084
Is that what you were gonna do?

91
00:03:40,118 --> 00:03:42,320
No. I was just gonna
go home and go to sleep,

92
00:03:42,354 --> 00:03:44,222
because I don't feel
like talking to you anymore.

93
00:03:44,256 --> 00:03:47,058
I should've known that weekend in
New York was too good to be true.

94
00:03:48,393 --> 00:03:50,595
I knew you'd run from me
the second either one of us

95
00:03:50,629 --> 00:03:52,363
showed any real feelings
toward the other one.

96
00:03:52,397 --> 00:03:55,499
I'm right here.
I'm not running.

97
00:03:55,534 --> 00:03:58,603
Not yet. But another five
minutes of this, and I will.

98
00:03:58,637 --> 00:04:00,905
I really don't feel
like talking about this.

99
00:04:00,939 --> 00:04:04,575
If you're not ready to be in an exclusive
relationship with me, that's fine.

100
00:04:04,610 --> 00:04:06,110
You're not ready.

101
00:04:06,144 --> 00:04:07,912
I'm ready for that kind
of relationship,

102
00:04:07,946 --> 00:04:11,415
but you're not,
so maybe we could just date.

103
00:04:11,450 --> 00:04:12,750
What do you mean?

104
00:04:12,784 --> 00:04:14,418
I mean date.

105
00:04:14,453 --> 00:04:17,054
You call me and ask me out
or I call you and ask you out,

106
00:04:17,089 --> 00:04:19,457
and we go to dinner
or go see a movie

107
00:04:19,491 --> 00:04:21,492
or you, me, and John
go to a circus.

108
00:04:21,526 --> 00:04:23,494
I don't really care
just as long as we're dating.

109
00:04:23,528 --> 00:04:24,829
I don't date, Amy.

110
00:04:24,863 --> 00:04:26,831
I'd rather join a circus
than date.

111
00:04:26,865 --> 00:04:30,434
Dating is what guys do when they're
trying to get a girl to have sex.

112
00:04:30,469 --> 00:04:32,870
I don't have to do that.

113
00:04:32,904 --> 00:04:34,639
You don't date?

114
00:04:34,673 --> 00:04:36,407
I don't date.

115
00:04:36,441 --> 00:04:39,076
You wouldn't date me
even if you thought dating me

116
00:04:39,111 --> 00:04:41,045
would eventually lead
to having sex with me?

117
00:04:41,079 --> 00:04:43,481
No, I wouldn't.

118
00:04:43,515 --> 00:04:45,650
I don't get it... dating.

119
00:04:45,684 --> 00:04:47,985
It's just a waste of time.

120
00:04:48,987 --> 00:04:50,121
Thanks.

121
00:04:50,155 --> 00:04:51,589
No problem.

122
00:05:01,433 --> 00:05:03,534
Spend the night with me.

123
00:05:03,568 --> 00:05:05,136

130
00:05:29,528 --> 00:05:32,496
I can't, Adrian.
Um, I have to go home.

131
00:05:35,033 --> 00:05:37,067
Do you ever think
about having sex with me?

132
00:05:39,070 --> 00:05:40,971
You're funny.

133
00:05:41,006 --> 00:05:43,107
You just had a scare
with the baby today.

134
00:05:43,141 --> 00:05:44,642
How can you even think
about having sex?

135
00:05:44,676 --> 00:05:45,976
I don't know.

136
00:05:46,011 --> 00:05:48,913
I'm just thinking about it
for some reason.

137
00:05:48,947 --> 00:05:50,815
Don't panic.
I don't mean tonight.

138
00:05:50,849 --> 00:05:52,783
I mean, sometime in the future.

139
00:05:53,852 --> 00:05:55,986
We could have sex again
if we wanted.

140
00:05:56,021 --> 00:05:58,689
Well, when my doctors
tell me it's safe again.

141
00:05:58,723 --> 00:06:01,459
When they say it's okay.

142
00:06:01,493 --> 00:06:03,461
I'm already pregnant, so...

143
00:06:03,495 --> 00:06:05,296
So I don't think
that your doctors

144
00:06:05,330 --> 00:06:07,064
would give you the okay
to have sex with me

145
00:06:07,098 --> 00:06:08,599
even if you weren't
having a baby.

146
00:06:08,633 --> 00:06:10,701
I mean, those guys
definitely don't like me,

147
00:06:10,735 --> 00:06:12,837
and I'm sure they don't want me
anywhere near you.

148
00:06:12,871 --> 00:06:15,473
And I'm sure that
your father doesn't, either.

149
00:06:15,507 --> 00:06:17,141
Not until there's a ring
on your finger.

150
00:06:17,175 --> 00:06:19,143
Well, your other finger.

151
00:06:19,177 --> 00:06:21,345
No, that's the right finger.

152
00:06:21,379 --> 00:06:23,180
But you know what I mean.
An engagement ring.

153
00:06:23,215 --> 00:06:25,749
And, besides,

154
00:06:25,784 --> 00:06:27,184
we're under doctor's orders
to grow up,

155
00:06:27,219 --> 00:06:28,919
and I'm not sure
that having sex

156
00:06:28,954 --> 00:06:30,287
just because you can't get
pregnant again

157
00:06:30,322 --> 00:06:31,489
is evidence that
we're growing up.

158
00:06:31,523 --> 00:06:34,391
Who knows
what a grown-up is?

159
00:06:34,426 --> 00:06:37,394
My doctors get to say whether or
not it's safe for me to have sex.

160
00:06:37,429 --> 00:06:39,063
They don't get to say
with whom.

161
00:06:39,097 --> 00:06:41,232
And my dad doesn't get
to say anything at all.

162
00:06:43,034 --> 00:06:45,503
I have to go, Adrian.

163
00:06:47,939 --> 00:06:49,240
Okay.

164
00:06:49,274 --> 00:06:50,875
Another night.

165
00:06:50,909 --> 00:06:52,543
Another night.

166
00:06:52,577 --> 00:06:56,380
And, um, let's make it
another night

167
00:06:56,414 --> 00:06:59,350
before Amy Juergens
gets back from New York.

168
00:06:59,384 --> 00:07:00,718
Why do you say that?

169
00:07:00,752 --> 00:07:03,087
I say that because

170
00:07:03,121 --> 00:07:05,022
if Amy comes back here

171
00:07:05,056 --> 00:07:06,957
and she gets into
a big fight with Ricky,

172
00:07:06,992 --> 00:07:09,894
and she decides she doesn't
want Ricky and does want you,

173
00:07:11,396 --> 00:07:13,631
you'll be gone.

174
00:07:13,665 --> 00:07:16,267
Of course,
I'll still have the ring.

175
00:07:17,369 --> 00:07:19,370
If that happens,
you can keep the ring.

176
00:07:20,572 --> 00:07:23,340
No, no. But that's
not going to happen.

177
00:07:23,375 --> 00:07:25,709
And even if it does happen,

178
00:07:25,744 --> 00:07:27,711
nothing that goes on
between Amy and Ricky

179
00:07:27,746 --> 00:07:29,547
is gonna change anything
between you and me.

180
00:07:29,581 --> 00:07:31,048
It could happen.

181
00:07:31,082 --> 00:07:32,716
In fact, it's likely to happen.

182
00:07:32,751 --> 00:07:34,485
Why?

183
00:07:34,519 --> 00:07:37,388
Because Amy doesn't understand Ricky
the way you understand Ricky?

184
00:07:37,422 --> 00:07:39,356
She doesn't.

185
00:07:40,825 --> 00:07:42,793
I have to go.
I'm tired,

186
00:07:42,827 --> 00:07:45,396
and I don't really care to hear
how well you know Ricky.

187
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:46,931
Okay? Good night.

188
00:07:48,967 --> 00:07:51,535
Good night, Adrian.

189
00:07:51,570 --> 00:07:53,537
I'm happy that everything
worked out today

190
00:07:53,572 --> 00:07:55,606
with you and the baby.

191
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:57,942
I'm happy that you're okay
and the baby's okay.

192
00:07:59,611 --> 00:08:02,746
But...Good night.

193
00:08:16,995 --> 00:08:19,430
We are not gonna have sex
under the king's roof.

194
00:08:19,464 --> 00:08:21,665
He'd never allow it.
He's not home.

195
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:23,167
He might come home.

196
00:08:23,201 --> 00:08:25,736
Let's just get up
and get into our sleeping bags.

197
00:08:25,770 --> 00:08:27,638
I don't like
the sleeping bag arrangements.

198
00:08:27,672 --> 00:08:30,374
I think we're getting too old for it.
Don't you?

199
00:08:30,408 --> 00:08:32,142
We're gonna be juniors
in high school next year.

200
00:08:32,177 --> 00:08:34,144
We're never gonna get
too old for it.

201
00:08:34,179 --> 00:08:36,447
I love sleeping in the
sleeping bags in Ben's room.

202
00:08:36,481 --> 00:08:38,549
It's one of my
favorite things in life.

203
00:08:38,583 --> 00:08:41,218
It takes me back to the time
when we weren't having sex.

204
00:08:41,252 --> 00:08:42,620
We were young and innocent.

205
00:08:46,458 --> 00:08:48,659
We're still young and innocent.
Young maybe.

206
00:08:48,693 --> 00:08:50,594
What's so great
about being innocent?

207
00:08:50,629 --> 00:08:52,463
I like having sex with you.

208
00:08:52,497 --> 00:08:54,365
No. I love having sex
with you.

209
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:55,799
Yeah, I know.

210
00:08:55,834 --> 00:08:57,801
And you?

211
00:08:57,836 --> 00:09:01,505
I love having sex with you.

212
00:09:01,539 --> 00:09:04,842
But how long will we love
having sex with each other?

213
00:09:04,876 --> 00:09:08,012
Forever. Or until
we graduate high school.

214
00:09:08,046 --> 00:09:09,480
Not funny.

215
00:09:09,514 --> 00:09:13,417
Maybe we can just sleep here
until Ben gets home.

216
00:09:13,451 --> 00:09:15,653
There's no harm in that...
in just sleeping.

217
00:09:15,687 --> 00:09:17,955
I guess not, especially
since we don't know

218
00:09:17,989 --> 00:09:19,556
if we'll be together
after high school.

219
00:09:19,591 --> 00:09:21,225
That was a joke, okay?

220
00:09:21,259 --> 00:09:23,494
You're going on vacation
with my family.

221
00:09:23,528 --> 00:09:24,995
You're in for life.

222
00:09:25,030 --> 00:09:27,131
And you're going
on vacation with my family,

223
00:09:27,165 --> 00:09:28,666
and it could be over for life.

224
00:09:34,406 --> 00:09:36,373
I love you, Alice.

225
00:09:36,408 --> 00:09:38,008
I love you, Henry.

226
00:09:40,879 --> 00:09:43,480
[Car door closes]

227
00:09:43,515 --> 00:09:45,416
I think I heard a car door.

228
00:09:45,450 --> 00:09:48,419
Just one car door?
Yeah. Ben.

229
00:09:48,453 --> 00:09:51,021
Hey, throw the cover over us.
We'll surprise him. [door opens]

230
00:09:51,056 --> 00:09:53,757
It'll be funny.
Okay. [chuckling]

231
00:09:53,792 --> 00:09:55,793
[Door closes]

232
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:03,033
[Together] Surprise!

233
00:10:03,068 --> 00:10:04,868
[Yells]
What are you doing here?

234
00:10:04,903 --> 00:10:07,171
What are you doing there
in my bed? That's my bed.

235
00:10:07,205 --> 00:10:08,872
You told us
you'd be home hours ago.

236
00:10:08,907 --> 00:10:10,374
[Exhales forcefully]
Yeah, okay.

237
00:10:10,408 --> 00:10:11,942
When I wasn't,
you devised a plan

238
00:10:11,976 --> 00:10:13,544
to kill me
by scaring me to death?

239
00:10:13,578 --> 00:10:15,212
Sorry. We thought
it'd be really funny,

240
00:10:15,246 --> 00:10:16,714
not that a lot of planning
went into it.

241
00:10:16,748 --> 00:10:18,382
[Sighs] Well, it wasn't.

242
00:10:18,416 --> 00:10:20,384
It was just scary.

243
00:10:20,418 --> 00:10:22,419
Just like the rest of my life.

244
00:10:22,454 --> 00:10:24,955
What's going on?
Is... is Adrian okay?

245
00:10:24,989 --> 00:10:27,157
Is the baby okay?
I thought she said everything was okay.

246
00:10:27,192 --> 00:10:30,094
It's not them.
It's... it's me.

247
00:10:30,128 --> 00:10:32,062
I think I might've
screwed up, again.

248
00:10:32,097 --> 00:10:34,064
[Together] What'd you do?

249
00:10:34,099 --> 00:10:35,599
[Knocking]

250
00:10:39,604 --> 00:10:41,905
Hey. What's going on?

251
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:43,507
I just got home.

252
00:10:43,541 --> 00:10:45,442
I know. We pulled in
right behind you,

253
00:10:45,477 --> 00:10:47,377
but you took off up the stairs.

254
00:10:47,412 --> 00:10:48,746
Henry, Alice.

255
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:50,047
[Together] Hi.

256
00:10:50,081 --> 00:10:51,415
I didn't see you.

257
00:10:51,449 --> 00:10:53,350
I was just focused
on getting up here.

258
00:10:53,384 --> 00:10:55,586
I wanna go to bed,
and I'm sure you do, too.

259
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:57,921
So good night, dad.
You didn't see us?

260
00:10:57,956 --> 00:10:59,923
No. I swear.

261
00:10:59,958 --> 00:11:01,859
I just really
want to get to bed.

262
00:11:01,893 --> 00:11:04,762
I'm exhausted. It's been a long day.
Good night.

263
00:11:04,796 --> 00:11:07,197
Wait a minute.
Is everything okay with Adrian?

264
00:11:07,232 --> 00:11:09,466
Everything turned out
all right, right?

265
00:11:09,501 --> 00:11:11,401
Yeah, everything's fine.

266
00:11:11,436 --> 00:11:15,072
Um, she asked me to stay over, but
I thought I should come on home.

267
00:11:15,106 --> 00:11:16,607
So good night.

268
00:11:16,641 --> 00:11:20,577
What? Well, go back
over there if you want,

269
00:11:20,612 --> 00:11:22,246
if you think Adrian needs you.

270
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:24,181
No. She's fine.

271
00:11:24,215 --> 00:11:26,617
Adrian really doesn't need anybody.
You know Adrian.

272
00:11:26,651 --> 00:11:28,685
Uh-huh.
Do you know Adrian?

273
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,621
You sure she doesn't
need anyone?

274
00:11:30,655 --> 00:11:32,122
She doesn't need you tonight?

275
00:11:32,157 --> 00:11:34,057
She doesn't
need me tonight, no.

276
00:11:34,092 --> 00:11:36,593
She asked me to stay,
but she's fine.

277
00:11:36,628 --> 00:11:38,962
Yeah, well,

278
00:11:38,997 --> 00:11:42,499
anytime she needs you,
you be there for her, all right?

279
00:11:42,534 --> 00:11:44,168
Of course.

280
00:11:45,403 --> 00:11:48,438
So, uh, anything else
going on with you and Adrian?

281
00:11:48,473 --> 00:11:49,973
No, nothing else.

282
00:11:51,810 --> 00:11:53,510
Is anything going on
with you and Betty?

283
00:11:53,545 --> 00:11:56,547
Had a very nice night tonight,
Betty and me.

284
00:11:56,581 --> 00:11:59,817
I decided not to let you,
or Adrian and you,

285
00:11:59,851 --> 00:12:02,252
uh, take up too much
of our time tonight.

286
00:12:02,287 --> 00:12:04,555
Tonight was about us.

287
00:12:04,589 --> 00:12:07,357
Tomorrow we'll get around to you.
We'll talk tomorrow.

288
00:12:07,392 --> 00:12:09,993
Okay. Well,
until tomorrow then.

289
00:12:10,028 --> 00:12:12,429
Until tomorrow.

290
00:12:12,463 --> 00:12:15,165
Good night, Henry.
Good night, Alice.

291
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,301
[Together]
Good night, Mr. Boykewich.

292
00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:20,537
What did you do?

293
00:12:20,572 --> 00:12:22,806
I gave Adrian a ring.

294
00:12:24,142 --> 00:12:26,410
He told you not to do that,
and we told you not to do that.

295
00:12:26,444 --> 00:12:28,478
Only he told you if you did,
you're engaged.

296
00:12:28,513 --> 00:12:32,015
Yes, but it's not an engagement
ring, and we're not engaged.

297
00:12:32,050 --> 00:12:34,818
You just wanted her to have the ring
before Amy gets home, didn't you?

298
00:12:34,853 --> 00:12:37,154
What? No.
Giving Adrian a ring

299
00:12:37,188 --> 00:12:39,189
is not gonna make Amy
come back to you.

300
00:12:39,224 --> 00:12:40,858
That's not why I did it.

301
00:12:40,892 --> 00:12:42,860
I didn't give Adrian a ring
to make Amy jealous,

302
00:12:42,894 --> 00:12:45,195
and she didn't take that ring
to make Ricky jealous.

303
00:12:45,230 --> 00:12:46,864
So why did you give it to her?

304
00:12:46,898 --> 00:12:48,365
I don't know exactly.

305
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:50,133
Why did Adrian take the ring?

306
00:12:50,168 --> 00:12:52,703
I don't think
she knows exactly.

307
00:12:52,737 --> 00:12:55,038
Uh-oh. I think I know.

308
00:12:55,073 --> 00:12:58,575
I think you might
care about her.

309
00:12:58,610 --> 00:13:00,344
Yeah. And maybe
she cares about Ben.

310
00:13:00,378 --> 00:13:03,513
We don't care about each other.
Not like that.

311
00:13:03,548 --> 00:13:06,049
Then like what?
Well, like we're having a baby.

312
00:13:06,084 --> 00:13:08,819
Every day, you get deeper
into this, my friend.

313
00:13:08,853 --> 00:13:10,888
If you're not careful,
you're gonna end up married.

314
00:13:10,922 --> 00:13:12,222
For real this time.

315
00:13:12,257 --> 00:13:14,725
You might just be right, Hank.

316
00:13:14,759 --> 00:13:16,226
This time, you might be right.

317
00:13:24,419 --> 00:13:25,919
From communicating
with Jack and Jesse.

318
00:13:25,953 --> 00:13:28,455
I mean, I'm sure there's
some way we can get to them.

319
00:13:28,489 --> 00:13:30,791
Yeah, I'm sure we can,
but we're not going to.

320
00:13:30,825 --> 00:13:32,292
We're on the honor system.

321
00:13:32,327 --> 00:13:34,261
We agreed
not to make phone calls

322
00:13:34,295 --> 00:13:36,630
or texts or e-mails
or anything else.

323
00:13:36,664 --> 00:13:40,267
Well, we didn't promise not to call,
text, or e-mail through a third party.

324
00:13:40,301 --> 00:13:41,968
You know how this works.

325
00:13:42,003 --> 00:13:43,637
If we go by the rules
for a while,

326
00:13:43,671 --> 00:13:46,139
our parents will probably
shorten our sentence.

327
00:13:46,174 --> 00:13:48,175
So just go by the rules
for once.

328
00:13:49,877 --> 00:13:51,478
This is so unfair.

329
00:13:51,512 --> 00:13:52,979
I feel like I'm in prison.

330
00:13:53,014 --> 00:13:55,716
Wait. No. On second thought,
if we were in prison,

331
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:58,618
we would have better uniforms than what
we have to wear to the food court.

332
00:13:58,653 --> 00:14:02,356
[Chuckles] Just do the time and
stop complaining about it.

333
00:14:02,390 --> 00:14:04,191
Complaining about it
only makes it worse.

334
00:14:04,225 --> 00:14:07,160
Yeah, it only makes it worse.
Hi, Jason.

335
00:14:07,195 --> 00:14:08,362
Hi, Madison.

336
00:14:08,396 --> 00:14:10,664
Good night.
Thanks for dropping by.

337
00:14:10,698 --> 00:14:13,533
All right. I'll leave.
Good night, Madison.

338
00:14:13,568 --> 00:14:15,135
So it's another summer
at med camp, huh?

339
00:14:15,169 --> 00:14:16,370
Uh, day after tomorrow.

340
00:14:16,404 --> 00:14:18,138
[Scoffs] Good night.

341
00:14:18,172 --> 00:14:22,142
[Chuckles] I saw your boyfriends
at the party. Good night.

342
00:14:22,176 --> 00:14:25,679
Wait, wait. Uh, what party?
What happened?

343
00:14:25,713 --> 00:14:27,381
Uh, who...
who were they there with?

344
00:14:27,415 --> 00:14:30,384
This could be a trap.
Don't break the rules.

345
00:14:30,418 --> 00:14:33,186
Well, it's not against the rules
to just ask about Jack and Jesse.

346
00:14:33,221 --> 00:14:34,888
Let me see. Uh,

347
00:14:34,922 --> 00:14:37,190
they were with each other
'cause they're both losers,

348
00:14:37,225 --> 00:14:40,260
and it was the football team-cheerleaders
"get to know you" party

349
00:14:40,294 --> 00:14:42,195
for the new team members
and the new cheerleaders.

350
00:14:42,230 --> 00:14:44,698
I think that's where
grace met Jack

351
00:14:44,732 --> 00:14:46,533
a couple years ago, isn't it?

352
00:14:46,567 --> 00:14:48,735
No, they met at church.

353
00:14:48,770 --> 00:14:51,371
Their first date
was at that party.

354
00:14:51,406 --> 00:14:53,206
What's your point?

355
00:14:53,241 --> 00:14:55,242
Yeah, what is your point,

356
00:14:55,276 --> 00:14:57,677
besides the fact that
you still haven't forgiven Jack

357
00:14:57,712 --> 00:14:59,246
for stealing Madison from you?

358
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:01,248
Lauren, that's not true.

359
00:15:01,282 --> 00:15:04,384
I mean, Jason and I just weren't even
interested in each other, right?

360
00:15:04,419 --> 00:15:06,219
No, definitely not.

361
00:15:06,254 --> 00:15:08,388
And I don't have a point, okay?

362
00:15:08,423 --> 00:15:10,590
I just wanted
to say good night.

363
00:15:10,625 --> 00:15:13,927
Oh, I almost forgot.
Uh, Jesse wanted me to give you a message.

364
00:15:13,961 --> 00:15:17,564
But I know you're not supposed to get messages
from Jesse, so I won't give it to you.

365
00:15:17,598 --> 00:15:18,732
Wait.

366
00:15:20,401 --> 00:15:22,135
Do you know
what the message is?

367
00:15:22,170 --> 00:15:23,904
He said to tell you
he loves you.

368
00:15:25,406 --> 00:15:27,274
Oh, wait.
No, that wasn't it.

369
00:15:27,308 --> 00:15:29,576
He said hi.

370
00:15:29,610 --> 00:15:31,278
To tell you hi.

371
00:15:36,184 --> 00:15:38,084
[Scoffs]

372
00:15:38,119 --> 00:15:40,954
This stinks.
That's what I'm talking about.

373
00:15:40,988 --> 00:15:42,589
I wanna see
what it's like up here.

374
00:15:42,623 --> 00:15:45,625
I haven't been up here since...
well, in a long time.

375
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:48,094
Since dad died.

376
00:15:49,197 --> 00:15:52,098
Don't worry.
He's here.

377
00:15:52,133 --> 00:15:55,635
Dad's still here with us
in the guest house.

378
00:15:55,670 --> 00:15:58,839
Okay. Now that I'm
totally creeped out,

379
00:15:58,873 --> 00:16:01,475
I think I'll just
go back to where I was.

380
00:16:01,509 --> 00:16:03,443
I thought you meant
you're going home.

381
00:16:03,478 --> 00:16:05,445
No, I told you I'd stay here
till Jack got home.

382
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:08,281
I'm fine. You don't
have to stay out here.

383
00:16:08,316 --> 00:16:09,783
I don't mind, really.

384
00:16:09,817 --> 00:16:11,117
I do mind.

385
00:16:11,152 --> 00:16:12,752
I'm tired.
I wanna go to bed.

386
00:16:12,787 --> 00:16:14,588
What time is Jack
supposed to be home?

387
00:16:14,622 --> 00:16:17,123
I don't know.
He doesn't have a curfew.

388
00:16:17,158 --> 00:16:19,793
Well, he left to go out
awfully late.

389
00:16:19,827 --> 00:16:20,994
Where is he?

390
00:16:21,028 --> 00:16:22,829
Who wants to know?

391
00:16:22,864 --> 00:16:25,632
Well, I imagine Madison
wants to know.

392
00:16:25,666 --> 00:16:27,834
I imagine she does.

393
00:16:27,869 --> 00:16:31,605
Does he have a date?
Is he dating 'cause he and Madison can't date?

394
00:16:31,639 --> 00:16:33,607
They were just forced
to break up.

395
00:16:33,641 --> 00:16:36,943
I can't imagine he'd be out
this soon, but that's Jack.

396
00:16:38,513 --> 00:16:40,847
Just tell me where he is.

397
00:16:40,882 --> 00:16:42,649
I'm not gonna pay you.

398
00:16:43,818 --> 00:16:45,318
Come on.
Just tell me who he's with.

399
00:16:45,353 --> 00:16:47,153
Twenty bucks!

400
00:16:47,188 --> 00:16:50,290
I don't have 20 bucks on me.
I'm in my pajamas.

401
00:16:50,324 --> 00:16:51,291
Go get it.

402
00:16:51,325 --> 00:16:52,292
Fine.

403
00:16:52,326 --> 00:16:53,793
You know, I change my mind.

404
00:16:53,828 --> 00:16:55,295
I don't wanna know where he is.

405
00:16:55,329 --> 00:16:56,796
Oh, yeah, you do.

406
00:16:56,831 --> 00:16:58,798
Oh, no, I don't.

407
00:16:58,833 --> 00:17:01,701
Wherever he is and whoever he's
with... it's none of my business.

408
00:17:01,736 --> 00:17:03,370
Not my problem.

409
00:17:03,404 --> 00:17:05,572
And I have to say,
it doesn't bother me

410
00:17:05,606 --> 00:17:08,074
if Madison spends the whole
summer worrying about Jack

411
00:17:08,109 --> 00:17:10,977
like I spent the whole summer
worrying about him last summer.

412
00:17:11,012 --> 00:17:13,647
And if he cheats on her,
who's gonna be surprised?

413
00:17:13,681 --> 00:17:16,349
Not me.

414
00:17:16,384 --> 00:17:18,318
Is he cheating on her already?

415
00:17:20,087 --> 00:17:21,721
Come on.
Just tell me where he is.

416
00:17:21,756 --> 00:17:23,657
At the party.

417
00:17:23,691 --> 00:17:25,926
That's where you two

418
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:29,329
first got together.

419
00:17:29,363 --> 00:17:30,997
Oh.

420
00:17:33,534 --> 00:17:35,602
It's not that I still
care about grace.

421
00:17:35,636 --> 00:17:37,437
I just don't want
to see her get hurt.

422
00:17:37,471 --> 00:17:39,539
You just don't want her
to have sex with another guy.

423
00:17:39,574 --> 00:17:40,907
Yeah, that, too.

424
00:17:40,942 --> 00:17:42,509
I just wish she'd wait.

425
00:17:42,543 --> 00:17:45,045
Until you see if things
are gonna work out with Madison?

426
00:17:45,079 --> 00:17:48,815
Yeah, because I'm the only guy
grace has ever been with,

427
00:17:48,849 --> 00:17:51,217
and I'd like it
to just stay that way.

428
00:17:51,252 --> 00:17:53,053
Well, it's not
gonna stay that way.

429
00:17:53,087 --> 00:17:54,554
Sooner or later, grace bowman

430
00:17:54,589 --> 00:17:57,557
is gonna hook up
with some other guy, you know?

431
00:17:57,592 --> 00:18:00,727
And whether that guy is Grant
or some other guy...

432
00:18:00,761 --> 00:18:02,862
And you've been
with some other girls.

433
00:18:02,897 --> 00:18:04,764
And I'm sure you're gonna be
with some more girls.

434
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:06,232
Maybe, maybe not.

435
00:18:06,267 --> 00:18:08,635
"Maybe not"?
[chuckles]

436
00:18:08,669 --> 00:18:11,605
Do you really think that you're gonna be
with Madison for the rest of your life?

437
00:18:11,639 --> 00:18:13,673
I might.
No, you won't.

438
00:18:13,708 --> 00:18:16,710
Not unless you wanna stay here and
go to college. I could do that.

439
00:18:16,744 --> 00:18:19,079
Just to be with Madison.
I could.

440
00:18:19,113 --> 00:18:21,748
You could get into
a dozen out-of-state schools

441
00:18:21,782 --> 00:18:23,249
on a football scholarship,

442
00:18:23,284 --> 00:18:25,552
but you would stay here and go
to school because of Madison,

443
00:18:25,586 --> 00:18:27,487
who you're not even sure
you wanna be with,

444
00:18:27,521 --> 00:18:29,723
depending on grace
and what she does?

445
00:18:29,757 --> 00:18:31,558
[Quietly] Okay, that's enough.

446
00:18:31,592 --> 00:18:33,259
Let him know you're here.
This isn't nice.

447
00:18:33,294 --> 00:18:35,061
He isn't nice.

448
00:18:37,765 --> 00:18:40,033
Grace was my first love.
Our first date

449
00:18:40,067 --> 00:18:41,968
was at that party we were at
tonight... the football party.

450
00:18:42,003 --> 00:18:44,771
I wasn't gonna go,
but then coach called...

451
00:18:44,805 --> 00:18:47,574
you're the quarterback. You're the team captain.
You're supposed to be there.

452
00:18:47,608 --> 00:18:49,509
I was there.
Late.

453
00:18:49,543 --> 00:18:52,278
Well, it didn't seem right to be out
partying when Madison's at home.

454
00:18:52,313 --> 00:18:53,880
They couldn't go with us.

455
00:18:53,914 --> 00:18:55,982
It was just for the guys
and the cheerleaders.

456
00:18:56,017 --> 00:18:57,350
I know.

457
00:18:57,385 --> 00:19:00,453
But, still,
if grace were to have me back

458
00:19:00,488 --> 00:19:02,856
and she wanted to give it
one more shot,

459
00:19:02,890 --> 00:19:04,958
I think I'd have to
go back with her.

460
00:19:04,992 --> 00:19:06,426
She's not gonna do that.

461
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:07,460
Probably not.

462
00:19:07,495 --> 00:19:09,462
Besides, even if she did,

463
00:19:09,497 --> 00:19:11,331
you're gonna be going off
to college in a year.

464
00:19:11,365 --> 00:19:13,299
Yeah, but I don't
have to go out of state.

465
00:19:13,334 --> 00:19:15,802
I can go in state. I was gonna go
in state anyway because of Madison.

466
00:19:15,836 --> 00:19:19,639
Deciding which college you go to
is an important decision.

467
00:19:19,674 --> 00:19:23,677
You can't decide which college
you go to based on a girl.

468
00:19:23,711 --> 00:19:25,278
Or two girls.

469
00:19:25,312 --> 00:19:27,113
Actually, I can.

470
00:19:27,148 --> 00:19:28,948
[Scoffs]

471
00:19:28,983 --> 00:19:30,917
[Phone ringing]

472
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:33,353
[Whispers] Is that grace?

473
00:19:33,387 --> 00:19:34,854
[Beeps]

474
00:19:34,889 --> 00:19:36,489
Hello?
<i>Hi.</i>

475
00:19:36,524 --> 00:19:38,692
Is it too late to call?
Are you in bed?

476
00:19:38,726 --> 00:19:39,693
I'm still out.

477
00:19:39,727 --> 00:19:41,628
You're still out
with your mother?

478
00:19:41,662 --> 00:19:44,330
You and your mother
are still out this late?

479
00:19:44,365 --> 00:19:46,866
Hello, grace.
Yes, it's me, Grant's mother.

480
00:19:46,901 --> 00:19:48,468
That's...
that's not your mother.

481
00:19:48,536 --> 00:19:50,136
You're not out
with your mother, are you?

482
00:19:50,171 --> 00:19:53,139
Well, grace, if you're not
gonna have sex with me,

483
00:19:53,174 --> 00:19:55,809
you know how it is.
[whispers] Stop it.

484
00:19:55,843 --> 00:19:57,877
<i>No, I don't.</i>
<i>How is it?</i>

485
00:19:57,912 --> 00:20:00,680
I'm just kidding around.
Yes, I'm out with my mother.

486
00:20:00,715 --> 00:20:03,683
We stopped on the way home to
have ice cream at the dairy shack

487
00:20:03,718 --> 00:20:06,386
just like we used to do
when I was a kid.

488
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:08,888
And guess who's here.
Your ex-girlfriend?

489
00:20:08,923 --> 00:20:11,191
Your old boyfriend.

490
00:20:11,225 --> 00:20:14,828
[Loudly] Jack and Jesse are
sitting right behind us.

491
00:20:14,862 --> 00:20:17,597
I'll call you back.
Is it too late to call you back?

492
00:20:17,631 --> 00:20:19,065
<i>I hope not.</i>

493
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:20,500
[Sighs] [beeps]

494
00:20:20,534 --> 00:20:22,869
Jack's there.
Grant's gonna call me back.

495
00:20:24,371 --> 00:20:26,206
Hey, Jack.
Hey, Grant.

496
00:20:27,374 --> 00:20:29,576
So you're Jack,
grace's old boyfriend.

497
00:20:29,610 --> 00:20:31,578
I've been dying to meet you.
Grace, too.

498
00:20:31,612 --> 00:20:33,213
Only Grant
won't bring her over.

499
00:20:33,247 --> 00:20:36,382
This is my mother Carrie.
Oh. Nice to meet you.

500
00:20:36,417 --> 00:20:38,918
Nice to meet you.
Would you and your friend like to join us?

501
00:20:38,953 --> 00:20:42,188
Oh, that's very nice of you
to offer, but no, thank you.

502
00:20:42,223 --> 00:20:44,290
We were just leaving,
since apparently

503
00:20:44,325 --> 00:20:46,893
someone's been sitting here
listening to our conversation.

504
00:20:46,927 --> 00:20:48,762
Yeah, pretty much.

505
00:20:48,796 --> 00:20:51,898
Yeah. Well, good night.

506
00:20:51,932 --> 00:20:53,299
Good night.

507
00:20:54,301 --> 00:20:55,969
[Sighs, mutters]

508
00:21:01,876 --> 00:21:03,409
His mother.

509
00:21:03,444 --> 00:21:04,978
You gotta hand it to the guy.

510
00:21:05,012 --> 00:21:06,746
He's determined
to keep me away from grace.

511
00:21:06,781 --> 00:21:08,848
And why is that?

512
00:21:08,883 --> 00:21:11,317
You're not already
having sex with grace, are you?

513
00:21:11,352 --> 00:21:13,253
Not yet.
Maybe this summer.

514
00:21:13,287 --> 00:21:14,621
Maybe. I don't know.

515
00:21:14,655 --> 00:21:16,122
Okay.

516
00:21:16,157 --> 00:21:18,758
Well, take plenty of condoms
with you to med camp.

517
00:21:18,793 --> 00:21:21,561
That girl has
way too many pregnant friends.

518
00:21:21,595 --> 00:21:23,129
[Chuckles] Just two.

519
00:21:23,164 --> 00:21:24,764
That's two too many.

520
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:28,034
All right.
I'll be right back.

521
00:21:28,068 --> 00:21:30,003
Ask for the check, please.

522
00:21:34,608 --> 00:21:36,576
[Beeping]

523
00:21:37,978 --> 00:21:39,646
<i>[Grace]</i>
<i>Hi.</i>

524
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:41,981
What are you doing up so late besides
waiting for me to call back?

525
00:21:42,016 --> 00:21:44,651
Oh, I'm just hanging out
in the guest house with Tom.

526
00:21:44,718 --> 00:21:46,152
He doesn't like
to be here alone.

527
00:21:46,187 --> 00:21:47,487
Liar.

528
00:21:47,521 --> 00:21:49,856
You're not just waiting
for Jack to come home?

529
00:21:49,890 --> 00:21:52,559
I ask because he told his friend
he's still interested in you,

530
00:21:52,626 --> 00:21:56,062
<i>so maybe you're</i>
<i>still interested in him.</i>

531
00:21:56,096 --> 00:21:58,798
And maybe you're still interested
in your old girlfriend?

532
00:21:58,833 --> 00:22:01,835
That wasn't exactly a no.
Are you?

533
00:22:01,869 --> 00:22:04,137
No, I'm not. We don't
let her live at our house

534
00:22:04,171 --> 00:22:06,172
so I can still see her
every day and every night.

535
00:22:08,209 --> 00:22:10,343
I really care about you, grace.

536
00:22:10,377 --> 00:22:12,145
We have an agreement.

537
00:22:12,179 --> 00:22:13,813
You're not gonna stomp
on my heart.

538
00:22:13,848 --> 00:22:16,382
No, I'm not gonna
stomp on your heart.

539
00:22:16,417 --> 00:22:18,384
I care about you, too.

540
00:22:18,419 --> 00:22:21,487
I'll see you tomorrow, okay?
Okay.

541
00:22:21,522 --> 00:22:24,390
And just so you know, I'm leaving
the guest house right now

542
00:22:24,425 --> 00:22:26,993
before Jack even gets home,
so I won't be talking to him.

543
00:22:27,027 --> 00:22:28,628
Thanks.

544
00:22:28,662 --> 00:22:31,164
I like that.
Good night.

545
00:22:31,198 --> 00:22:33,099
Good night.

546
00:22:33,133 --> 00:22:34,634
[Beeps]

547
00:22:42,076 --> 00:22:43,910
[Door closes]

548
00:22:43,944 --> 00:22:47,480
Good night, Mrs. calabash,

549
00:22:47,514 --> 00:22:49,515
wherever you are.

550
00:22:53,204 --> 00:22:55,272
I can't sleep.
I can.

551
00:22:55,306 --> 00:22:56,506
You can?

552
00:22:56,541 --> 00:22:59,710
Come on, Amy.
I knew I should've gone home.

553
00:23:01,145 --> 00:23:03,146
I just have to ask you
one thing.

554
00:23:03,181 --> 00:23:05,816
Can't it wait until morning?

555
00:23:05,850 --> 00:23:09,019
You know how you said maybe you
had sex with someone else?

556
00:23:09,053 --> 00:23:10,087
Did you?

557
00:23:10,121 --> 00:23:12,155
"Don't ask me about
my business, kay."

558
00:23:12,190 --> 00:23:13,156
What?

559
00:23:13,191 --> 00:23:14,658
"All right.

560
00:23:14,692 --> 00:23:17,794
This one time I'll let you
ask me about my affairs."

561
00:23:17,829 --> 00:23:20,464
What are you talking about?
I feel like Michael Corleone

562
00:23:20,498 --> 00:23:22,532
when his wife, kay,
cornered him.

563
00:23:22,567 --> 00:23:24,768
Who?
<i>The godfather.</i>

564
00:23:24,802 --> 00:23:27,971
What godfather? The movie.
You've never seen <i>the godfather?</i>

565
00:23:28,006 --> 00:23:31,141
No. Then never mind.
Just go back to sleep.

566
00:23:31,175 --> 00:23:34,978
I just have to know.
Just tell me the truth. Did you?

567
00:23:36,180 --> 00:23:39,149
All right. I was gonna
tell you at some point anyway.

568
00:23:39,183 --> 00:23:41,652
So go ahead.
Tell me.

569
00:23:41,686 --> 00:23:44,221
Don't get upset.
I won't get upset.

570
00:23:44,255 --> 00:23:46,156
As long as you tell me the
truth, I won't get upset.

571
00:23:46,190 --> 00:23:48,191
I had a chance to,
but I didn't.

572
00:23:48,226 --> 00:23:50,694
Which doesn't mean I will never
have sex with anyone else again.

573
00:23:50,728 --> 00:23:53,697
So you haven't had sex with anyone
since you've been back from New York?

574
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:58,835
Okay.
Thanks for telling me.

575
00:24:01,005 --> 00:24:02,205
Okay, but...

576
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:03,774
no. No "buts."

577
00:24:03,808 --> 00:24:06,843
I don't wanna discuss this, especially
in the middle of the night.

578
00:24:06,878 --> 00:24:09,646
You've forgotten what it's like
getting up with John in the morning.

579
00:24:09,681 --> 00:24:11,048
Save your energy for that.

580
00:24:11,082 --> 00:24:13,483
Who did you have a chance
to have sex with?

581
00:24:13,518 --> 00:24:15,419
Was it Ashley?
No, not Ashley.

582
00:24:15,453 --> 00:24:17,354
You know I'd never
have sex with Ashley.

583
00:24:17,388 --> 00:24:19,056
No, of course not.

584
00:24:21,192 --> 00:24:23,360
I already told you
I'd never have sex with Ashley.

585
00:24:23,394 --> 00:24:24,995
We already talked about her.

586
00:24:25,029 --> 00:24:27,831
You know everything she ever said to
me and everything I ever said to her.

587
00:24:27,865 --> 00:24:29,633
Then who?
That's it, Amy.

588
00:24:29,667 --> 00:24:30,701
I can't take it anymore.

589
00:24:30,735 --> 00:24:32,269
That's the end
of the discussion.

590
00:24:32,303 --> 00:24:34,871
If you keep talking about this,
I'm going home.

591
00:24:34,906 --> 00:24:36,506
I'm really going home.

592
00:24:36,541 --> 00:24:38,041
Go back to sleep.

593
00:24:38,076 --> 00:24:40,844
Okay, okay.

594
00:24:40,878 --> 00:24:44,581
I won't talk about it anymore.

595
00:24:44,615 --> 00:24:46,817
Can I just take another guess?

596
00:24:46,851 --> 00:24:49,786
Please don't.

597
00:24:49,821 --> 00:24:51,989
Great.

598
00:24:52,023 --> 00:24:53,490
Good night, Amy.

599
00:24:53,524 --> 00:24:55,192
Good night, Ricky.

600
00:24:56,561 --> 00:24:58,628
<i>[John crying]</i>

601
00:24:58,663 --> 00:25:00,797
Oh, great.
He probably heard you.

602
00:25:00,832 --> 00:25:02,733
He probably heard us.

603
00:25:02,767 --> 00:25:05,102
[Sighs] And are we gonna
get up and see about him,

604
00:25:05,136 --> 00:25:07,571
or will I be doing that?
Could you?

605
00:25:07,605 --> 00:25:10,073
Fine. I'll get him.

606
00:25:10,108 --> 00:25:13,643
Why shouldn't I get him?
I've been getting him for the past month.

607
00:25:13,678 --> 00:25:15,679
I've been getting him
for the past year.

608
00:25:16,681 --> 00:25:18,181
Bring him in here, okay?

609
00:25:18,216 --> 00:25:19,750
That's not a good idea.

610
00:25:19,784 --> 00:25:21,685
It's fine.
He's used to being in here.

611
00:25:21,719 --> 00:25:22,719
I like him in here.

612
00:25:22,754 --> 00:25:24,721
Well, I like to leave him
in the nursery.

613
00:25:24,756 --> 00:25:26,223
And it's better for him.

614
00:25:26,257 --> 00:25:29,826
He's not used to being in here
with the two of us.

615
00:25:29,861 --> 00:25:32,496
[Door opens] Great.

616
00:25:32,530 --> 00:25:34,798
[Door closes]
So he thinks he knows best.

617
00:25:37,268 --> 00:25:39,269
Was that Robie
just a minute ago?

618
00:25:39,303 --> 00:25:41,538
No, not Robie.

619
00:25:41,572 --> 00:25:43,540
Are you sure?

620
00:25:43,574 --> 00:25:45,542
Yeah, I'm sure.

621
00:25:45,576 --> 00:25:47,711
What time is it?

622
00:25:47,745 --> 00:25:49,746

4:30.

624
00:25:51,282 --> 00:25:53,784
I had a dream
that Amy was home.

625
00:25:53,818 --> 00:25:55,652
Yeah, she's home.

626
00:25:56,988 --> 00:25:58,321
What?

627
00:25:59,457 --> 00:26:01,391
I heard her.
She and Ricky were talking.

628
00:26:01,426 --> 00:26:03,093
Kind of loud.
I think he left.

629
00:26:03,127 --> 00:26:05,095
Wait. What?

630
00:26:05,129 --> 00:26:07,464
I forgot to tell you.

631
00:26:07,498 --> 00:26:09,766
She called to find out
if she could change her flight.

632
00:26:09,801 --> 00:26:12,569
She didn't say she was coming home.
She just was thinking about it.

633
00:26:12,603 --> 00:26:15,138
It's a refundable ticket.
What... Amy's home?

634
00:26:15,173 --> 00:26:18,108
She's home early,
and you didn't even tell me?

635
00:26:18,142 --> 00:26:21,478
You were asleep, and when I saw
her, so was she and so was Ricky.

636
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:24,681
I figured you'd find out
in the morning anyway.

637
00:26:24,715 --> 00:26:27,084
That my daughter
is home from New York early?

638
00:26:27,118 --> 00:26:28,618
Thanks a lot, George.

639
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:31,688
I wanna know what
she's doing home early.

640
00:26:31,722 --> 00:26:32,722
Ask her.

641
00:26:33,758 --> 00:26:35,425
I will.

Yeah?

647

I'm so happy you're home.

648
00:26:51,943 --> 00:26:53,577
Why are you home?

649
00:26:53,611 --> 00:26:56,012
I missed John and Ricky,
and I wanted to see Ricky.

650
00:26:56,047 --> 00:26:58,715
Well, why is that?
Why'd you wanna see Ricky?

651
00:26:58,749 --> 00:27:00,517
You just saw Ricky.

652
00:27:00,551 --> 00:27:03,019
Did you have a fight with Ricky?
No.

653
00:27:03,054 --> 00:27:05,122
Well, you didn't just leave
that program early

654
00:27:05,156 --> 00:27:07,257
because you missed
John and Ricky.

655
00:27:07,291 --> 00:27:09,092
And by the way,

656
00:27:09,127 --> 00:27:12,195
didn't you miss me and your dad
and Ashley and Robie?

00:27:15,032 --> 00:27:17,634
Okay, Amy.
We'll talk in the morning.

00:27:17,668 --> 00:27:19,703
I'm happy you're home.

660
00:27:19,737 --> 00:27:21,705
[Sighs] I think.

661

Yeah, me, too.

662
00:27:23,241 --> 00:27:25,509
Good night, Amy.

663
00:27:25,543 --> 00:27:26,810
Night.

664
00:27:26,844 --> 00:27:28,011
I love you.

665
00:27:28,045 --> 00:27:29,045
You, too.

[Door closes]

667
00:27:36,721 --> 00:27:39,055
So you're still here.
You didn't go home?

668
00:27:39,090 --> 00:27:41,725
I'm here. But don't worry.
I'm going home.

669
00:27:41,759 --> 00:27:42,859
Now?

670
00:27:42,894 --> 00:27:44,394
When Amy gets up.

671
00:27:44,428 --> 00:27:45,729
I see.

672
00:27:45,763 --> 00:27:47,197
She asked me to stay.

673
00:27:47,231 --> 00:27:49,499
Oh, so of course
you had to stay.

674
00:27:49,534 --> 00:27:53,069
[Sighs] What's going on?
Why is she home early?

675
00:27:53,104 --> 00:27:54,738
She just wanted to come home.

676
00:27:54,772 --> 00:27:56,373
She said she was ready
to come home.

677
00:27:56,407 --> 00:27:57,774
And why is that?

678
00:27:57,808 --> 00:27:59,609
It's her home.

679
00:27:59,644 --> 00:28:00,744
Uh-huh.

680
00:28:00,778 --> 00:28:02,946
I was just checking on John.
He woke up.

681
00:28:02,980 --> 00:28:04,915
He's already
back to sleep, so...

682
00:28:04,949 --> 00:28:06,750
so you're just gonna go
back in there with Amy.

683
00:28:06,784 --> 00:28:08,251
I could sleep on the couch.

684
00:28:08,286 --> 00:28:10,921
That would be a lot more
comfortable and quieter.

685
00:28:10,955 --> 00:28:12,923
Quieter, huh?

686
00:28:12,957 --> 00:28:15,992
[Sighs]
So you two were fighting.

687
00:28:16,027 --> 00:28:17,994
Let me guess.
You went out with some other girl.

688
00:28:18,029 --> 00:28:19,996
Or, rather, you slept
with another girl,

689
00:28:20,031 --> 00:28:21,831
and Amy felt like she had to
rush home to keep you

690
00:28:21,866 --> 00:28:23,633
from being with that girl
or with anyone else.

691
00:28:23,668 --> 00:28:25,735
She just wanted to come home.

692
00:28:25,770 --> 00:28:28,738
I don't think Amy's ever gonna be able
to stop you from being with other girls

693
00:28:28,773 --> 00:28:30,774
'cause that's just
the kind of guy you are, Ricky.

694
00:28:30,808 --> 00:28:33,143
And Amy's either gonna
have to live with that

695
00:28:33,177 --> 00:28:35,812
or you two are gonna have to
face the fact that despite John,

696
00:28:35,846 --> 00:28:38,615
you two really shouldn't be together,
because that's what life would be like.

697
00:28:38,649 --> 00:28:41,484
And yet, you're about to
get remarried to your husband.

698
00:28:45,957 --> 00:28:49,292
Good night.
I'll be in the living room.

699
00:29:07,812 --> 00:29:09,813
[Whining]

700
00:29:50,688 --> 00:29:52,021
Oh, no.

701
00:29:53,157 --> 00:29:54,924
You could've just
stuck your head in

702
00:29:54,959 --> 00:29:57,026
and told me you weren't
coming back to my room.

703
00:29:57,061 --> 00:29:58,528
Your mother met me
in the hallway.

704
00:29:58,562 --> 00:30:01,030
She didn't really want me
to come back in your room.

705
00:30:01,065 --> 00:30:03,233
I've managed to survive here
for the past month

706
00:30:03,267 --> 00:30:06,269
without getting on anyone's bad
side except for maybe Ashley's,

707
00:30:06,303 --> 00:30:08,405
so I came in here.

708
00:30:08,439 --> 00:30:10,874
Please, Amy, would you just
let me get some sleep?

709
00:30:10,908 --> 00:30:12,342
You just got home.

710
00:30:12,376 --> 00:30:15,111
We got all summer to talk to each
other, to be with each other.

711
00:30:15,146 --> 00:30:16,880
You're right.

712
00:30:20,484 --> 00:30:23,253
Who was it?
Just tell me who it was.

713
00:30:23,287 --> 00:30:25,588
If you weren't gonna tell me who it was,
you shouldn't have brought it up.

714
00:30:25,623 --> 00:30:27,757
I didn't bring it up.
You brought it up.

715
00:30:27,792 --> 00:30:30,059
Okay, fine. I brought it up.
Who was it?

716
00:30:30,094 --> 00:30:31,795
It was someone
you don't know, all right?

717
00:30:31,829 --> 00:30:33,296
Really? It was someone
I don't know?

718
00:30:33,330 --> 00:30:35,298
Yeah, it was someone
you don't know,

719
00:30:35,332 --> 00:30:37,600
so don't start guessing a list
of names here, all right?

720
00:30:37,635 --> 00:30:39,302
Are you sure it was someone
I don't know?

721
00:30:40,604 --> 00:30:42,272
Maybe you're lying about that.

722
00:30:42,306 --> 00:30:44,307
Maybe. Maybe I'm lying.

723
00:30:44,341 --> 00:30:46,609
And maybe I slept with
another girl or two

724
00:30:46,644 --> 00:30:49,212
or three or four,
and you know all of them.

725
00:30:49,246 --> 00:30:52,449
No, I believe you... that you got
the opportunity but didn't.

726
00:30:54,819 --> 00:30:58,621
I'm just trying to think of who you had
the opportunity to sleep with but didn't.

727
00:31:00,324 --> 00:31:01,791
Was it Adrian?

728
00:31:03,027 --> 00:31:04,594
Was it Adrian? Was it?

729
00:31:04,628 --> 00:31:06,930
What the... Adrian?

730
00:31:06,964 --> 00:31:09,799
I don't even talk to Adrian,
and Adrian's having a baby.

731
00:31:09,834 --> 00:31:11,968
You can still have sex
if you're having a baby.

732
00:31:12,002 --> 00:31:14,971
I would have sex with Adrian
while she's having Ben's baby?

733
00:31:15,005 --> 00:31:16,906
She might've offered,

734
00:31:16,941 --> 00:31:20,443
and that's a situation which you
might've turned down, if offered.

735
00:31:20,478 --> 00:31:22,946
I can't believe
you're telling Adrian

736
00:31:22,980 --> 00:31:25,615
you wanna be friends with her when you
don't think any more of her than that.

737
00:31:25,649 --> 00:31:28,818
I didn't really have
these thoughts about Adrian...

738
00:31:28,853 --> 00:31:33,356
you and adrian... until tonight
when you said you turned down sex.

739
00:31:33,390 --> 00:31:35,792
So... so, when are you gonna see Ben?

740
00:31:35,826 --> 00:31:37,794
Maybe he'll offer
to have sex with you,

741
00:31:37,828 --> 00:31:39,829
and you can turn him down,
and then we can be even.

742
00:31:39,864 --> 00:31:42,031
[Sighs] I don't know when
I'm going to see Ben.

743
00:31:42,066 --> 00:31:43,500
I do plan on seeing him, but...

744
00:31:43,534 --> 00:31:45,735
but you were waiting to see
how things go with me first?

745
00:31:45,769 --> 00:31:47,504
You were waiting to see
if Adrian and I

746
00:31:47,538 --> 00:31:49,506
had been sneaking around
behind your backs?

747
00:31:49,540 --> 00:31:51,674
Jeez, I can't believe
you would think that.

748
00:31:52,710 --> 00:31:54,310
I was wrong.

749
00:31:54,345 --> 00:31:57,013
I don't think it was out of the
question, but I was wrong.

750
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:02,218
I would never get in the way
of Ben having a relationship

751
00:32:02,253 --> 00:32:04,721
with the woman
he's having a baby with.

752
00:32:04,755 --> 00:32:07,857
He needs to be
with Adrian right now.

753
00:32:07,892 --> 00:32:10,460
Now? What about later?

754
00:32:11,729 --> 00:32:14,030
I doubt that he and Adrian
will end up together.

755
00:32:14,064 --> 00:32:15,198
Because?

756
00:32:15,232 --> 00:32:16,566
Because.

757
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:18,835
Because Adrian's not
good enough for Ben?

758
00:32:18,869 --> 00:32:21,137
I didn't say that.
That's what you think...

759
00:32:21,171 --> 00:32:22,639
that she's not
good enough for him

760
00:32:22,673 --> 00:32:24,574
because he's such a nice guy,

761
00:32:24,608 --> 00:32:27,110
and he would never get involved
with a girl like Adrian.

762
00:32:27,144 --> 00:32:30,013
I did not say that.
She's a nice girl... Adrian.

763
00:32:30,047 --> 00:32:32,815
I know.
No, you don't know.

764
00:32:32,850 --> 00:32:35,818
You're being nice to her,
but be honest here.

765
00:32:35,853 --> 00:32:37,820
You think it was lousy
of her to seduce Ben,

766
00:32:37,855 --> 00:32:41,190
and you feel badly for him
that she got pregnant.

767
00:32:41,225 --> 00:32:44,294
I don't think there was a whole
lot of seduction going on.

768
00:32:44,328 --> 00:32:46,129
He wasn't just friends
with Adrian

769
00:32:46,163 --> 00:32:47,997
to be friends with Adrian.

770
00:32:48,032 --> 00:32:50,567
He was curious about sex
with Adrian all along

771
00:32:50,601 --> 00:32:52,769
because he's attracted to her.

772
00:32:52,803 --> 00:32:55,038
So when he got his chance,
he took it,

773
00:32:55,072 --> 00:32:58,508
whether he cared anything
at all about her or not.

774
00:32:58,542 --> 00:33:00,310
And let me tell
you something, Amy.

775
00:33:00,344 --> 00:33:01,444
When he does get to know her,

776
00:33:01,478 --> 00:33:04,147
when he does find out
how smart she is

777
00:33:04,181 --> 00:33:06,282
and what a big heart she has,

778
00:33:06,317 --> 00:33:08,217
he might just fall in love
with her.

779
00:33:08,252 --> 00:33:09,919
And he might've anyway,
baby or not.

780
00:33:09,954 --> 00:33:11,621
I doubt it.

781
00:33:11,689 --> 00:33:13,523
Are you planning
to use this time

782
00:33:13,557 --> 00:33:16,392
while Ben's with Adrian
as some experiment?

783
00:33:16,427 --> 00:33:19,696
You know, a time to find out if
we're really meant for each other

784
00:33:19,730 --> 00:33:21,698
so that if we're not,

785
00:33:21,732 --> 00:33:23,366
when Ben and Adrian's
baby gets here

786
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:25,234
and all hell breaks loose
a couple months into it,

787
00:33:25,269 --> 00:33:27,070
you'll know whether or not
you'd rather be with him?

788
00:33:27,104 --> 00:33:30,540
No! This has nothing to do with
them... with Ben and Adrian.

789
00:33:30,574 --> 00:33:33,843
This is about us.

790
00:33:33,877 --> 00:33:35,144
I want this summer

791
00:33:35,179 --> 00:33:37,246
to be our time to get
to know each other

792
00:33:37,281 --> 00:33:40,583
and to see if there's any chance
we can actually be a couple

793
00:33:40,618 --> 00:33:43,319
and actually get married
in the distant future

794
00:33:43,354 --> 00:33:46,255
and be a family...
the three of us.

795
00:33:46,290 --> 00:33:48,324
I have a difficult
time believing

796
00:33:48,359 --> 00:33:51,394
that whatever our feelings are
for Ben and Adrian...

797
00:33:51,428 --> 00:33:53,596
that those feelings
don't have something to do

798
00:33:53,631 --> 00:33:56,799
with everything going on
with us right now.

799
00:33:56,834 --> 00:33:59,435
And I also have
a difficult time believing

800
00:33:59,470 --> 00:34:02,105
that going to movies
and going out to dinner

801
00:34:02,139 --> 00:34:04,240
and taking John to the circus

802
00:34:04,274 --> 00:34:06,643
would help us decide what our
feelings are for each other

803
00:34:06,677 --> 00:34:09,278
and whether or not we wanna be
together the rest of our lives.

804
00:34:09,313 --> 00:34:11,314
But that's what
people do, okay?

805
00:34:11,348 --> 00:34:14,183
They go out. They talk.
They get to know each other.

806
00:34:14,218 --> 00:34:15,885
They... they fall in love,

807
00:34:15,919 --> 00:34:18,287
and then they get married...
Sometimes.

808
00:34:20,290 --> 00:34:23,059
I want that.

809
00:34:23,093 --> 00:34:26,295
And while we're going out
and talking

810
00:34:26,330 --> 00:34:28,297
and getting to know each other

811
00:34:28,332 --> 00:34:30,967
and falling in love,

812
00:34:33,671 --> 00:34:36,005
I wanna graduate high school,

813
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:39,842
and I wanna graduate college
and start a career.

814
00:34:41,211 --> 00:34:43,212
I wanna be a teacher.

815
00:34:43,247 --> 00:34:45,782
I wanna teach girls
to believe in themselves,

816
00:34:45,816 --> 00:34:48,051
because I believe in myself.

817
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:52,655
I believe I can be
a good teacher

818
00:34:52,690 --> 00:34:55,858
and a good mother

819
00:34:55,893 --> 00:34:58,661
and a good wife to you,
someday.

820
00:35:15,837 --> 00:35:18,405
[Phone beeping]

821
00:35:23,378 --> 00:35:26,146
Grace, your phone's beeping.

822
00:35:26,181 --> 00:35:28,182
I think you have messages
or something.

823
00:35:28,216 --> 00:35:30,884
That's okay.
I'll just check them later.

824
00:35:30,919 --> 00:35:32,820
I'm gonna go home, all right?

825
00:35:32,854 --> 00:35:34,388
Tell your mom thanks
for inviting me over.

826
00:35:34,422 --> 00:35:37,091
She didn't invite you.
I invited you.

827
00:35:37,125 --> 00:35:38,892
She just let you come over.

828
00:35:38,927 --> 00:35:41,095
Maybe next time
she'll let me sleep with you.

829
00:35:41,129 --> 00:35:43,430
[Chuckles] Don't bet on it.

830
00:35:43,465 --> 00:35:45,099
Okay. I won't bet on it.

831
00:35:45,133 --> 00:35:46,800
It was fun
having you sleep here.

832
00:35:46,835 --> 00:35:49,603
I just can't figure out
why she let you

833
00:35:49,638 --> 00:35:51,772
actually come over here
in the middle of the night.

834
00:35:51,806 --> 00:35:54,675
Why not?
Why not?

835
00:35:54,709 --> 00:35:57,244
I mean, she's made it pretty clear
that she doesn't want us to have sex,

836
00:35:57,279 --> 00:35:59,580
but then she lets you
sleep in my room?

837
00:36:01,149 --> 00:36:03,417
Oh, no. I hope
she's not up to something.

838
00:36:03,451 --> 00:36:06,487
She's not up to anything.
She trusts us.

839
00:36:06,521 --> 00:36:09,123
She trusts me anyway.

840
00:36:10,125 --> 00:36:12,293
See you later.
I'll call you.

841
00:36:12,327 --> 00:36:15,496
Tell your mom I said hello.
I'm really looking forward to meeting her.

842
00:36:15,530 --> 00:36:17,398
I'll introduce you.

843
00:36:17,432 --> 00:36:20,200
She's a very special person...
my mom...

844
00:36:20,235 --> 00:36:23,937
and way too involved in my life,
so let's just wait until,

845
00:36:23,972 --> 00:36:27,007
you know, you know you like me.

846
00:36:27,042 --> 00:36:29,176
I like you.

847
00:36:29,210 --> 00:36:30,611
[Chuckles]

848
00:36:30,645 --> 00:36:32,579
Where's your dad, by the way?

849
00:36:32,614 --> 00:36:34,014
He's...

850
00:36:35,250 --> 00:36:36,517
Long story.

851
00:36:36,551 --> 00:36:38,285
I'll tell you about it
some other time.

852
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:41,021
It's nothing bad.
He's around.

853
00:36:41,056 --> 00:36:42,189
Okay.

854
00:36:43,825 --> 00:36:46,260
Okay, see you.
See you.

855
00:36:49,264 --> 00:36:52,232
[Door opens, closes]

856
00:36:52,267 --> 00:36:54,535
She's up to something.

857
00:37:08,216 --> 00:37:10,918
Okay, you gotta go home.
What?

858
00:37:10,952 --> 00:37:13,954
You've gotta go home.
I've gotta get up and get my day going.

859
00:37:13,988 --> 00:37:16,490
Oh, so much for sleeping over.

860
00:37:16,524 --> 00:37:18,359
Being close and all that, huh?

861
00:37:18,393 --> 00:37:20,210
Yeah. It's not me.

862
00:37:20,245 --> 00:37:23,781
[Groans] Then who was it
that I was with last night?

863
00:37:23,815 --> 00:37:25,783
Go home.

864
00:37:25,817 --> 00:37:27,551
Okay.

865
00:37:28,753 --> 00:37:30,721
[Groans]

866
00:37:30,755 --> 00:37:33,424
[Sighs] I've got to talk to my
dad about giving you that ring.

867
00:37:33,458 --> 00:37:34,725
I'm sure he knows.

868
00:37:34,759 --> 00:37:37,494
Oh, yeah. The ring.
I forgot all about the ring.

869
00:37:37,529 --> 00:37:40,330
Already?
It's like a dream or something.

870
00:37:40,365 --> 00:37:42,433
Only better 'cause it's real.

871
00:37:42,467 --> 00:37:44,968
I can't wait to show grace
and my parents

872
00:37:45,003 --> 00:37:46,904
and everyone I know,
or don't know.

873
00:37:46,938 --> 00:37:48,806
Okay. Well,
when you show it to them,

874
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:51,642
please make it clear that
it's not an engagement ring.

875
00:37:51,676 --> 00:37:54,178
If we say it's an engagement
ring, then we're in trouble.

876
00:37:54,212 --> 00:37:56,080
[Scoffs] You're in trouble, not me.

877
00:37:56,114 --> 00:37:58,949
Okay, I'm in trouble.
It's not an engagement ring.

878
00:37:58,983 --> 00:38:00,617
I know.

879
00:38:00,652 --> 00:38:01,618
[Sighs]

880
00:38:01,653 --> 00:38:03,287
Get up, bedhead.

881
00:38:03,321 --> 00:38:04,922
I always have bedhead.

882
00:38:04,956 --> 00:38:07,057
It's worse if I shower
right before I go to bed.

883
00:38:07,092 --> 00:38:10,727
It's cute. I like when
you're not so perfect.

884
00:38:10,762 --> 00:38:13,297
Which is most of the time, right?
[chuckles]

885
00:38:13,331 --> 00:38:16,633
No, most of the time
you are perfect.

886
00:38:16,668 --> 00:38:18,168
Too perfect for me.

887
00:38:18,203 --> 00:38:21,805
Adrian, I am not too perfect,

888
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:23,941
especially for you.

889
00:38:23,975 --> 00:38:26,844
In fact, I don't even know
if I feel worthy of you.

890
00:38:26,878 --> 00:38:28,779
What are you talking about?

891
00:38:28,813 --> 00:38:30,881
You're just so...

892
00:38:30,915 --> 00:38:34,284
Full of life and...Fun

893
00:38:34,319 --> 00:38:36,820
and crazy and carefree

894
00:38:36,855 --> 00:38:39,389
and...Beautiful,

895
00:38:39,424 --> 00:38:41,325
and I'm not.

896
00:38:41,359 --> 00:38:43,894
But you're very confident

897
00:38:43,928 --> 00:38:47,898
and considerate and...Just
such an honorable person.

898
00:38:47,932 --> 00:38:51,902
You have dignity...
real dignity, Ben.

899
00:38:51,936 --> 00:38:54,004
Oh, at least
when your hair is combed.

900
00:38:54,038 --> 00:38:55,439
[Both chuckle]

901
00:38:55,473 --> 00:38:57,973
I really appreciate
you standing by me like this,

902
00:38:58,626 --> 00:39:01,028
and I hope you continue
to do that...

903
00:39:01,062 --> 00:39:03,964
to stand by me even when Amy
comes back from New York.

904
00:39:03,998 --> 00:39:07,100
And I think it's really nice
that she called me

905
00:39:07,135 --> 00:39:09,369
and that she's offering
to be my friend,

906
00:39:09,404 --> 00:39:11,205
but, well,

907
00:39:11,239 --> 00:39:14,675
I have to say,
I really didn't miss her.

908
00:39:14,709 --> 00:39:17,678
I'm happy that she's been away

909
00:39:17,712 --> 00:39:21,548
and that we've had this time
together without her around.

910
00:39:21,583 --> 00:39:24,485
And I know that you just can't
wait to talk to her face-to-face,

911
00:39:24,519 --> 00:39:28,121
but I think it was
kind of a blessing in disguise

912
00:39:28,156 --> 00:39:30,991
that she went away and that
she wasn't talking to you.

913
00:39:32,527 --> 00:39:35,996
It gave us a chance to talk
to each other... you and me.

914
00:39:38,066 --> 00:39:40,033
Um, I'll call you later.

915
00:39:40,068 --> 00:39:42,102
And if you have
any problems today,

916
00:39:42,136 --> 00:39:44,905
do not go to the hospital
again by yourself, okay?

917
00:39:44,939 --> 00:39:46,206
Okay.

918
00:39:46,241 --> 00:39:47,908
Bye.

919
00:39:47,942 --> 00:39:49,810
Bye.

920
00:39:49,844 --> 00:39:53,847
Ooh. I'm starting
to get a little bump.

921
00:39:53,882 --> 00:39:55,716
Yeah.
[chuckles]

922
00:39:57,852 --> 00:39:59,453
Bye.

923
00:40:14,402 --> 00:40:16,737
Oh, look.
My two boys are here.

924
00:40:16,771 --> 00:40:19,273
Good morning, John.

925
00:40:19,307 --> 00:40:22,209
[Chuckles] Good morning, Ricky.

926
00:40:22,243 --> 00:40:24,545
You put me through hell
last night.

927
00:40:24,579 --> 00:40:26,914
Don't say that in front of your son.
He might repeat it.

928
00:40:26,948 --> 00:40:28,582
I'm gonna go home now.

929
00:40:28,616 --> 00:40:30,350
Can't you stay
and have breakfast?

930
00:40:30,385 --> 00:40:33,353
No, I can't.
I have to work today.

931
00:40:33,388 --> 00:40:35,055
You want me to drop John off?

932
00:40:35,089 --> 00:40:37,224
No. I'm gonna keep him
with me today.

933
00:40:38,660 --> 00:40:40,527
I wanna spend some time
with him.

934
00:40:40,562 --> 00:40:42,262
I really missed him.
Okay.

935
00:40:42,297 --> 00:40:45,198
Well, bye, Amy.

936
00:40:45,233 --> 00:40:46,916
It's been nice being here,
kind of.

937
00:40:48,286 --> 00:40:50,454
Thank you for doing this.

938
00:40:50,488 --> 00:40:52,523
Thank you for letting me
go to New York

939
00:40:52,557 --> 00:40:54,458
and being with John.

940
00:40:54,492 --> 00:40:56,393
You're welcome.

941
00:40:57,996 --> 00:40:59,430
I'll call you later.

942
00:40:59,464 --> 00:41:01,632
Great. I'll look forward
to hearing from you.

943
00:41:01,666 --> 00:41:04,602
[Chuckles] That sounds kind
of formal, don't you think,

944
00:41:04,636 --> 00:41:06,403
for two people who have a son?

945
00:41:06,438 --> 00:41:09,073
Well, I just thought it sounded polite.
[laughs]

946
00:41:12,444 --> 00:41:14,678
Is there something else
you wanted?

947
00:41:14,713 --> 00:41:17,414
Something you wanted to ask me?

948
00:41:20,385 --> 00:41:22,486
Would you and John
like to go out with me tonight?

949
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:24,254
We would love to.

950
00:41:24,289 --> 00:41:26,390
What time will you
be picking us up?

951
00:41:28,026 --> 00:41:29,560
Or we could pick you up.

952
00:41:29,594 --> 00:41:32,062
That's less date-like.
Mmm.

953
00:41:32,097 --> 00:41:34,531
I'll see you around 7.

954
