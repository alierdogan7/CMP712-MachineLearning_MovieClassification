00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:45,992
<i>New York,</i>
<i>February 16, 1959</i>

2
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:55,713
Hurry! She collapsed 10 minutes ago.

3
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:30,551
The ambulance is on its way.

4
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:00,797
<i>Saint Theresa, dear God,</i>
<i>do not forsake me</i>...

5
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:06,313
<i>...give me strength. I want to live.</i>
<i>Restore me to life.</i>

6
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:14,197
Paris, Belleville, 1918

7
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:32,037
Why are you crying?
-Get the hell out of here, scum!

8
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:41,553
<i>I'm so lonely and miserable.</i>
<i>Life is so hard.</i>

9
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:46,470
<i>But it's all I know.</i>
<i>What more can I say?</i>

10
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,512
What are you doing here?

11
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:53,995
Why are you crying?
Are you on your own?

12
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:57,471
Where's your mother?

13
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:04,311
<i>Wherever I go,</i>
<i>in chains,</i>

14
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:10,189
<i>There is nothing but pain.</i>
<i>Nothing to accomplish.</i>

15
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:16,796
<i>My life is so hard.</i>
<i>I've known nothing else,</i>

16
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:20,516
<i>I'm all alone and miserable.</i>

17
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:23,439
A fine mother YOU are!
Hanging's too good for you!

18
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:27,315
I have to live too. I'm a singer!
-She should be looking after your daughter!

19
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:29,351
I look after her very well!

20
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:44,193
<i>Louis, I can no longer wait here for you.</i>
<i>Belleville is horrible.</i>

21
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:48,355
<i>My agent says that someone with my talent</i>
<i>should go to Constantinople...</i>

22
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:51,154
<i>...just like Frehel the singer...</i>

23
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:53,676
Good news for our acrobat?

24
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:57,954
Sure, and Clemenceau sends his regards.

25
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:06,390
<i>I left Edith with my mother.</i>

26
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:09,876
<i>She'll take care of her</i>
<i>till I'm on my feet again.</i>

27
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:13,712
<i>Louis, I can't wait for you any longer.</i>

28
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,319
<i>Anetta.</i>

29
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:40,719
Anybody home?

30
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:14,953
Edith?

31
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:24,350
Louis?

32
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:30,559
I'm taking her with me.

33
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:57,196
Bernay, Normandy, 1918

34
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:30,999
And who's this?

35
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:36,316
Your granddaughter: Edith.

36
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:41,232
That's a peculiar name.

37
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:50,836
She's a sickly looking child.

38
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:55,119
Come with me.

39
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:06,912
What are you doing here?

40
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:10,194
What a angel!
What's your name?

41
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:14,712
Back to work, Titine!
-There's someone in the toilet upstairs.

42
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:17,436
What lovely blue eyes you have.

43
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:33,158
I'm listening...

44
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:36,912
I have to be getting back.

45
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:42,791
I'll be demobbed soon.
Then I can work as an acrobat again.

46
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:46,429
I'll return for my little angel.
-Not now!

47
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:49,996
I'm finished, Mama Louise.
-Watch the door.

48
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,474
Where's her mother?

49
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:00,318
No idea.

50
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,391
Would you want her to stay here?

51
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:12,592
People will talk.
-People always talk.

52
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:50,437
Isn't she going with us to Mass?

53
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:57,638
We'll be late for Mass.
-The world doesn't revolve around her.

54
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:08,196
It appears we have a baby.
-May we see her?

55
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:12,359
It's a little girl. Would she like some bread?
-All right, everybody leave, please.

56
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:16,989
Come on, ask her if she'll sing for us.

57
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:22,150
A shame that communists aren't allowed on the stage.

58
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:31,473
<i>One night I went swimming</i>
<i>in my birthday suit,</i>

59
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:36,515
<i>Nobody could see me,</i>
<i>Only the night itself.</i>

60
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:42,158
<i>Until the moon suddenly appeared,</i>
<i>I felt like saying: shine on me.</i>

61
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:44,920
<i>Then I heard close by</i>

62
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:47,031
<i>A heartfelt cry.</i>

63
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:52,075
<i>A man stood on a rock,</i>
<i>Low enough to see me.</i>

64
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:54,191
<i>The man cried "Oh!"</i>

65
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:59,754
<i>And from the water,</i>
<i>I cried "oh" back.</i>

66
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:03,232
<i>He saw me naked,</i>

67
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:11,748
<i>Nothing to cover me,</i>
<i>I blushed the whole night long.</i>

68
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:17,796
<i>He saw me naked,</i>
<i>Completely naked.</i>

69
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:23,836
<i>Out of respect for the poor man,</i>
<i>I covered up my face.</i>

70
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:29,717
<i>But now I know</i>
<i>that by doing so</i>

71
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:36,473
<i>I ended up showing</i>
<i>my charms below.</i>

72
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:41,153
<i>He saw me naked.</i>

73
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:04,156
Titine! Open the door.
That's enough now.

74
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:07,033
What's the matter?
- She has Edith with her.

75
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:09,913
Open up I say!
-Whatever is the matter?

76
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:13,715
Nothing. Get a move on.
The customers will be here any minute.

77
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:18,077
Open the door! Otherwise I'll...
-I don't want to work.

78
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:21,748
I don't want to work.
-Oh, you don't want to work?

79
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:27,751
What do you think this is, a hotel?
-Edith is staying here with me tonight.

80
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:29,678
That's what YOU think.

81
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:34,716
It's me. Open this door.
The soldier is here.

82
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:39,471
<i>I couldn't care less.</i> 
<i>That liar with his lies and alibis.</i>

83
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:45,277
<i>Stop your nonsense and get yourself out here.</i>
<i>Otherwise it's the street for you.</i>

84
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:47,550
I'm tired of you playing the drama queen!

85
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:00,233
I don't want any nonsense.

86
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:20,029
New York, May 8, 1959

87
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,519
Doug!

88
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:30,192
What, are you jealous?

89
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:34,552
I'll send the Billie Holiday records
to the hotel.

90
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:39,231
<i>Thank you, Loulou. Billie and I were born the same year.</i> 
<i>Is that not something?</i>

91
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:43,711
I've brought my drawings.

92
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:47,673
You want to see them now, or later?

93
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:51,156
Later. First I have to sing that shmuck's song.

94
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:55,588
That's before your time...
-What?

95
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:58,554
Nothing.

96
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:25,559
I'm ready.

97
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:27,315
I'm ready.

98
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:46,759
That's Jeanne!

99
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:51,918
What's the matter?

100
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:54,710
Blood everywhere...
-Tell me about it!

101
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:58,669
<i>He wanted to play doctors and patients,</i>
<i>with my instruments.</i>

102
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:00,313
The filthy swine!

103
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:03,713
Titine!

104
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:07,595
We'll have to tell Madame.
-She'll kill me. It hurts!

105
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:12,596
I can't see anything.

106
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,753
Well, doctor?
-It's not good I'm afraid.

107
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:36,838
It's her cornea.

108
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:39,200
Is she blind?

109
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:41,957
It's an infection.

110
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:45,270
Patience. This sort of thing can last for months.

111
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:48,838
Take this to the pharmacist.

112
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:51,439
My thanks.

113
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:53,039
Whose child is she?

114
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:56,752
Nobody's.

115
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:37,912
Lisieux, Normandy

116
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:46,232
<i>Theresa, I never ask anything of you.</i>
<i>But I'm asking you to listen to little Edith.</i>

117
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:51,232
Please, Edith.
Say it. She's listening.

118
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:56,832
Theresa, I don't want to be blind.
I want to see.

119
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:59,429
She bumps into everything.
Go on.

120
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:04,475
<i>I want to learn how to read, and to run like I used to.</i> 
<i>I don't want to be blind.</i>

121
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:08,559
Saint Theresa, please ask baby Jesus
to take care of Edith.

122
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:10,919
Go on.

123
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:15,319
Thank you, Saint Theresa, Jesus.
-Thank you.

124
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:18,039
She can see...

125
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:20,629
She can see!

126
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,318
Titine, get up!

127
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:34,951
What is it?
-He's back. He's come for Edith.

128
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:36,673
Get dressed.

129
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:38,871
They can't do this to me!

130
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:41,874
How can you keep on doing this?

131
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:43,798
She'll see a lot of the world.

132
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:44,955
Go!

133
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:48,199
Edith!

134
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:49,913
Titine!

135
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:53,271
Don't take my little girl away.

136
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:55,311
Let her go!

137
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:57,352
Enough!

138
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:59,153
She's crazy!

139
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:00,679
Stop or I'll throw you out!

140
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:02,950
You've no right!

141
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:12,150
Don't do this to me!
-Go!

142
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:22,511
It's over! I'm ending it all.

143
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:30,879
Here we are at Orly airport.
The passengers are disembarking...

144
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:35,551
...I see Edith Piaf!
With a young man in tow.

145
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:39,150
What have you brought back from America?
-An American.

146
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:40,998
What's his name?

147
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:43,395
Edith, for God's sake!

148
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,231
Just as in her song, she's carried
<i>'</i>by the crowd.<i>'</i>.

149
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:50,638
She's stepping into her amazing black-and-white automobile.

150
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:54,952
She looks exhausted, but she's dazzling all the same.

151
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:03,715
Quiet, please! I wish to propose a toast ...

152
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:05,250
You're drunk!

153
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,399
You're one to talk!

154
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:10,837
Help the invalid.

155
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:16,068
Look out, accordion player, or I'll get you.

156
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:19,068
Perfect timing.

157
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:22,511
Get the manager.
I demand champagne on the house.

158
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:25,877
I'm Edith Piaf,
and I've made a mess of things.

159
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:31,714
Kiss one another! Even those who don't like each other! 
<i>Kiss me, Claude.</i>

160
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:39,711


161
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:42,515
Who's that slapper?
-No idea.

162
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:47,077
The spicy beef tartare?
-Where's your handsome friend?

163
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:51,558
Don't embarrass her...
-Cool it. Who asked you?

164
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:53,836
Miss?

165
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:57,350
Miss Piaf, what an honour!
What can I do for you?

166
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:02,319
A lot. I'd like a present.
-But of course.

167
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:07,030
I wanted champagne, but I prefer a ring...

168
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:09,993
...a large ring studded with diamonds.

169
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:13,510
Don't bother. We'll have the champagne.

170
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:17,478
Here's to the love I feel for all of you...

171
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:21,434
...for which I stand. Help me up, someone.

172
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:28,357
A toast to Marguerite.

173
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:34,478
My composer and most loyal friend in the business.

174
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:39,639
Oh, don't blush so. You're making us weep.

175
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:58,635
What about a photograph?
-I don't think so.

176
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:04,149
Bubbles and alcohol, perfect!
That's Claude's doing.

177
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:09,354
<i>You're such a bore, Loulou.</i> 
<i>We've just returned to Paris, and we're having fun.</i>

178
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:15,200
Stop playing the unhappy lover.

179
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,594
I'm waiting for someone.

180
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:26,112
Don't forget you've responsibilities. 
There's more than you.

181
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:29,796
Remember the first night
in Gerney<i>'</i>s?

182
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:34,109
I looked like a bag lady.
You thought I was a princess.

183
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:37,193
You WERE a princess.
<i>My</i> princess!

184
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:39,511
To Marguerite.

185
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:43,079
To all those who wished to 
see me come a cropper.

186
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:46,317
They think I don't know!
Cheers!

187
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,959
What's the matter, Louis?
-He's in bad form.

188
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:58,230
Go away. We're busy.

189
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:29,433
You're not here as decoration.
Get to work.

190
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:32,837
To work, you.
This is no child's play.

191
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:35,873
You'll earn your keep. Enough!

192
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:42,271
Stupid child!
You're in everyone's way!

193
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:47,990
Go to the trailer.
See to the meal.

194
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:53,911
Ladies and gentlemen, let's hear it
for Louis, the Human Snake!

195
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:38,593
What a little angel.

196
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:42,593
How old is she?
-Ten.

197
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:45,353
No mother?

198
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:46,956
What do you mean?

199
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:49,917
You be so lonely.

200
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:53,832
What about a calvados
in your trailer?

201
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:56,873
Let's go.

202
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:44,793
<i>Do you know who I am?</i>

203
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:50,311
<i>I'm Theresa.</i>

204
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:53,990
<i>Are your eyes all right, sweetheart?</i>

205
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:56,194
Yes.

206
00:27:56,640 --> 00:28:00,997
<i>You're so adorable.</i>
<i>Whom do wish to pray for?</i>

207
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:03,991
I want to pray for Titine.

208
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:08,034
<i>Very well. I shall look after you.</i>

209
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:09,593
<i>Never forget that.</i>

210
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:13,236
<i>Whenever you feel lonely,</i>
<i>remember I'm always here.</i>

211
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:32,558
Right, that's it!
You were supposed to change that wheel.

212
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:36,196
We're all in the same rotten boat!

213
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:40,830
I don't care!
-No? Then screw you!

214
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:46,956
You shouldn't let that 
kind of thing get you down!

215
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:50,709
I can't stand Caroli!

216
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:53,036
You're drunk.
-I'm going solo.

217
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:55,959
Fat chance of that!
There aren't that many circuses.

218
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:58,833
I'll manage.

219
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:03,749
Just when I was getting used to you.
-You'll do okay without me!

220
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:14,278
Saint Theresa, please make him change his mind. 
I don't want to leave the circus.

221
00:30:57,800 --> 00:30:59,518
He's completely messed up.

222
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:10,232
Is the girl part of the act?

223
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:12,715
Hold on.
Do something.

224
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:16,828
Before they go, do something.

225
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:20,636
Come on, do something.

226
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:16,628
Bravo!

227
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:27,752
That's my daughter!

228
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:39,191
Grasse. October 1963

229
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:46,600
I'm sick of this carrot juice.
-You'll drink it as long as I'm nursing you.

230
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:55,196
I like it dark.
-The sun will do you good.

231
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:12,193
It's hard I know, 
but you need a lot of rest...

232
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:13,879
...and patience.

233
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:18,790
Your husband phoned today...
-No point.

234
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:25,076
What bothers me 
is that I exaggerated.

235
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:30,191
The past 3 years were awful.

236
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:33,070
You're a performer.

237
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:37,279
Simone?

238
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:45,030
I suppose I'll never sing again?

239
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:08,550
Paris, Montmartre.
October 1935

240
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:14,551
What's up with you?

241
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:16,592
I'm hungry.

242
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:46,795
First we sing, then we eat.

243
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:51,198
Sing alone and you're a beggar.
When you're a duo it's a show.

244
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:56,033
I want to sing here.

245
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:08,359
Hey, you!

246
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:11,236
No street singing allowed.

247
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:12,993
Is that a fact?

248
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:14,997
How old are you?
-Twenty.

249
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:16,758
What's that?

250
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:20,955
She's had hardly anything to drink.
-Come here.

251
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:22,714
Do you know <i>'</i>Du Gris<i>'</i>?

252
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:25,434
Oh, sir...
-Shut up!

253
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:30,914
If you sing that, I'll let you go. That's my beat. 
I'll look the other way.

254
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:06,313
Next week it's our 21st.
Sisters for 5 years.

255
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:11,071
What do you prefer, working with me
or in the factory?

256
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:15,671
I'd rather cut my own throat.
How about you?

257
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:17,313
What do you mean?

258
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:21,718
Killing yourself in your little milk shop?
-Shut up! Not while we're eating.

259
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:24,674
Anetta, no moaning, okay?

260
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:27,436
Look, it's your drunken mother.

261
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,274
Edith?

262
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:38,397
Do you have any change?

263
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:50,832
That's all?
-I haven't much money.

264
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:53,554
Give me some bank notes.
-I don't have any.

265
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:58,634
I'm your mother.
-Go to hell!

266
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:04,436
Shall I sing a song?
-Throw her out!

267
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:09,793
I'm a performer. What about you?

268
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,150
You'll find out!

269
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:14,476
What'll I find out?
-When you're lying in the gutter.

270
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:18,878
Keep it down or leave!
-When you're in need...

271
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:20,354
Fuck off!

272
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:26,231
...don't depend on your daughter 
giving you a bite to eat.

273
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:30,479
That's enough.
-I'm off. Have the rest if you want.

274
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:34,639
You're no singer, you slut!
-Leave her alone or you'll answer to me.

275
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:38,678
Oh, don't bother with that lot!

276
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:40,754
Fuck you!

277
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:44,279
Go and prostitute yourself on the street!

278
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:47,315
While you still can!

279
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:51,993
Thanks very much.

280
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:43,912
You'll ruin your voice doing that.
-I have to eat.

281
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:45,753
Of course you do.

282
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:48,957
I'm Louis Leplée.

283
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:53,597
Here's my card. Come round to Gerney<i>'</i>s, 
tomorrow at two.

284
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:57,349
Are you a singer?
-No, but I have other talents.

285
00:38:57,560 --> 00:39:01,314
Bring your music with you, 
whatever you intend singing.

286
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:03,828
What if I don't come?

287
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:08,155
That's up to you, my girl.

288
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:34,757
This is all you have to show for a whole day? 
This is how you reward my belief in you?

289
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:37,879
I've put a little aside for my father.
He's sick and he's broke.

290
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:41,470
I'm not a social worker.
-No really. He's sick.

291
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:47,350
If I toss you out on the street 
maybe you'll get it.

292
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:48,436
Let her go!

293
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:53,077
Never! I'd rather starve than be a whore.

294
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:56,033
If you die, it's your own fault!
-Shut up!

295
00:39:57,720 --> 00:39:59,676
I want MORE, is that clear?

296
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:02,952
Or you spread your legs, just like the rest.

297
00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:04,593
You first.

298
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:16,432
Albert, I'm sorry...

299
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:20,554
Please stay!
-Leave the bastard.

300
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:27,955
Give her something to drink.

301
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:31,715
Are you coming to the Chinese?
-Who else is going?

302
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:34,070
The two Italians.

303
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:39,391
Plenty of snuff and tobacco.
And the warmth of another body...

304
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:45,470
Because we did it once,
doesn't mean I wish to do it again.

305
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:48,558
Don't start.
-Shall I explain?

306
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:51,911
I care not a jot for you, 
and you want to know why?

307
00:40:52,120 --> 00:40:57,148
No, I'm too stupid?
Because I'm an artist.

308
00:40:57,360 --> 00:41:01,239
I'm going to the top. I know it.
I've always known it!

309
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:06,352
It's the Little Flower...

310
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:10,473
...Saint Theresa,
I foresee great things.

311
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:20,116
Seen her clothes?
She looks ill.

312
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:23,354
Where did he find her?

313
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:41,111
She's unbelievable.

314
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:43,549
Champagne.

315
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:47,276
The boss is crazy about her.
-What a voice!

316
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:56,638
She's really something, Louis.
-Spare me your jealousy, Josette.

317
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:27,671
What's your name again?
-Edith Giovanna Gassion.

318
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:31,794
Hmm, not very impressive.
-I have other names:

319
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,434
Huguette Helias, Tania...

320
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:38,109
...Denise Jay.

321
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:42,394
You've had a manicure!
-That wasn't the question.

322
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:47,756
You're just like a bird.
-You think so?

323
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:49,154
Really?

324
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:52,796
Is <i>'</i>Little Bird<i>'</i> taken?
-Yes, it's taken.

325
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:55,072
A sparrow...

326
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:59,956
Would you call a sparrow <i>'</i>piaf<i>'</i>?
Is that how you say it?

327
00:43:02,040 --> 00:43:04,315
<i>The Little Sparrow</i>.
-Brilliant!

328
00:43:04,520 --> 00:43:07,478
It's stupid.
-What would YOU know?

329
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:10,433
<i>The Little Sparrow.</i>
-Brilliant!

330
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:15,395
You'll need a suitable repertoire.
Bruants <i>'</i>Les Mômes de la Cloche<i>'</i>.

331
00:43:15,600 --> 00:43:19,673
I know it.
-If necessary practise it all night.

332
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:22,232
We'll start you on Friday.

333
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:26,517
Show's beginning.

334
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:29,832
Take care of your protégée.
She's a slow starter.

335
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:31,519
I'm on my way.

336
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:37,151
Philippo, no more alcohol backstage.

337
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:47,468
What are you doing?
-I'd no time to finish it.

338
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:51,116
I'm knitting the sleeve.
-Now! We've a full house.

339
00:43:51,320 --> 00:43:54,198
All the more reason!
She can't go on like that!

340
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:58,518
Look, our star is dressing the newcomer.

341
00:43:59,480 --> 00:44:02,631
That's fine.
-Girls, let's go.

342
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:06,389
I have to throw up.
-Not now. Hurry up.

343
00:44:11,640 --> 00:44:16,589
A day or two ago, on my way home,
Lady Luck led me...

344
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:18,677
...to the artist you'll see tonight.

345
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:23,237
Here she is, exactly as I first saw her,
an unpolished jewel:

346
00:44:23,720 --> 00:44:27,395
From the street to Gerny<i>'</i>s:
<i>The Little Sparrow.</i>

347
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:55,349
She's like a sister to me.

348
00:46:14,320 --> 00:46:17,676
Did I lie?
-She's extraordinary.

349
00:47:06,120 --> 00:47:09,317
This is the great Jean Mermoz.

350
00:47:09,680 --> 00:47:11,716
This is for you.

351
00:47:12,440 --> 00:47:13,873
Thank you.

352
00:47:14,080 --> 00:47:15,433
Come along, Edith.

353
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:19,632
You've won them over.
And you'll continue doing just that...

354
00:47:19,840 --> 00:47:23,116
...I'm introducing you to someone 
who can help your career along.

355
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:30,033
I'm Marguerite Monnot.
I'm a pianist.

356
00:47:30,240 --> 00:47:33,391
If you need music, I'll gladly supply it.

357
00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:35,989
Thank you.
-Come.

358
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:42,158
Edith, this is Mr. Jacques Canetti.
Artistic director of <i>Radio Cité.</i>

359
00:47:42,360 --> 00:47:46,558
Miss, I was under your spell.
-Thank you.

360
00:47:46,760 --> 00:47:50,673
Please, join us at our table.
-I can't. I have to go.

361
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:52,916
What can be so important?

362
00:47:54,560 --> 00:47:55,913
Thank you.

363
00:47:56,120 --> 00:47:57,030
What's the matter?

364
00:47:57,240 --> 00:47:59,071
Wonderful, wonderful...

365
00:48:06,920 --> 00:48:10,993
Get out right now or I'll...
-Hit him in the kisser!

366
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:13,919
I've waited an hour for you!

367
00:48:14,120 --> 00:48:16,759
Go to hell, you bastard!

368
00:48:20,760 --> 00:48:21,988
Stop it.

369
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:20,118
Miss, you're wonderful.

370
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:20,152
My hand's about to fall off.
More bubbles.

371
00:49:20,360 --> 00:49:22,191
Give me the bottle.

372
00:49:22,840 --> 00:49:27,914
I said you should listen to me. Radio is
a powerful medium, am I right, Coquatrix?

373
00:49:28,120 --> 00:49:31,590
But don't underestimate the <i>Music Hall</i>.
-Of course not.

374
00:49:32,520 --> 00:49:34,112
I've something for you.

375
00:49:34,320 --> 00:49:36,038
A song?
-Of course.

376
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:40,188
Raymond!
Mireille, fetch Raymond !

377
00:49:42,200 --> 00:49:45,272
Somebody here for you.

378
00:49:49,240 --> 00:49:51,310
That big guy wants to see you.

379
00:49:52,280 --> 00:49:58,150
This is Raymond Asso.
Writer, composer, poet.

380
00:49:59,160 --> 00:50:00,275
I'll be right back.

381
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:01,799
I love your work.

382
00:50:02,360 --> 00:50:05,113
I don't love your face.

383
00:50:10,440 --> 00:50:12,317
I've seen you often.

384
00:50:13,560 --> 00:50:15,039
I haven't seen you.

385
00:50:16,600 --> 00:50:18,955
Midnight, everyone on their feet!

386
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:41,239
You're a big star.
-Yes, I wear high heels.

387
00:50:46,760 --> 00:50:50,116
If you wish...
Call me. I'll be waiting.

388
00:51:09,960 --> 00:51:11,552
Papa Leplée!

389
00:51:13,080 --> 00:51:16,470
A toast to Papa Leplée,
my saviour.

390
00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:25,270
Grasse. October 1963

391
00:52:22,160 --> 00:52:25,709
He was a very discreet man...

392
00:52:25,920 --> 00:52:31,552
Were you here yesterday?
-Yes, but I didn't see him.

393
00:52:31,880 --> 00:52:35,589
So he was at home.
-Perhaps. Too bad.

394
00:52:35,800 --> 00:52:39,509
He was discreet,
so lovely and attentive.

395
00:53:09,160 --> 00:53:11,799
You bring bad luck!

396
00:53:17,280 --> 00:53:18,793
It's her fault!

397
00:53:25,360 --> 00:53:27,430
Are you the <i>Little Sparrow?</i>

398
00:53:29,680 --> 00:53:32,877
Come with me, please.
-Why?

399
00:53:33,080 --> 00:53:34,479
This way.

400
00:53:35,080 --> 00:53:37,355
Let me through.

401
00:53:38,240 --> 00:53:40,834
I'm talking to you.

402
00:53:41,160 --> 00:53:43,549
Have you ties with the underworld?
-No.

403
00:53:45,280 --> 00:53:46,952
Leave me alone.

404
00:53:47,160 --> 00:53:52,553
And Henri Valette? And George, Johnny the
Sailor and Albert? Never heard of them?

405
00:53:53,040 --> 00:53:55,679
Those are friends of mine. 
They've nothing to do with this.

406
00:53:56,400 --> 00:54:01,872
Being an accessory is a criminal offence.
-I'm innocent! I've done nothing.

407
00:54:02,320 --> 00:54:05,153
I've lost everything.
-Where were you last night?

408
00:54:05,360 --> 00:54:08,033
I told you: partying...

409
00:54:09,720 --> 00:54:13,474
Bastards, swine!
This is disgusting!

410
00:54:13,680 --> 00:54:15,716
We're not in the theatre now.

411
00:54:15,960 --> 00:54:19,794
It seems you have a couple of nasty friends.

412
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:24,312
They're not like that.
-Sure, and I'm a cretin.

413
00:54:26,840 --> 00:54:29,274
Have you an explanation?
-Not at this time.

414
00:54:29,480 --> 00:54:31,516
It's a disgrace!

415
00:54:31,720 --> 00:54:35,759
Go back to the gutter, slag!
-Leave her alone!

416
00:54:35,960 --> 00:54:39,430
She didn't do it!
-Have you named names?

417
00:54:39,640 --> 00:54:41,915
This is a funeral.
Have a little respect!

418
00:54:46,080 --> 00:54:49,277
Just one more question.
-Vultures! Go away!

419
00:54:50,240 --> 00:54:52,196
Out of the way!
Get the hell out of here!

420
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:57,030
It's over. I'm dead.
I've been dragged through the shit.

421
00:54:58,320 --> 00:55:00,470
Forget it.

422
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:03,633
I haven't done anything!
-I know that.

423
00:55:06,440 --> 00:55:07,509
Open up!

424
00:55:16,360 --> 00:55:18,476
What?
-Simone Berteaut?

425
00:55:19,680 --> 00:55:20,430
Yes.

426
00:55:20,960 --> 00:55:23,918
Miss, please come with us.

427
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:25,719
Why?

428
00:55:26,360 --> 00:55:31,036
Your mother has arranged with the court
for you to be placed in a boarding school.

429
00:55:31,440 --> 00:55:35,991
Immediately.
Pack your things.

430
00:55:36,200 --> 00:55:40,239
No! She's staying here.
-This has nothing to do with you.

431
00:55:41,200 --> 00:55:43,953
For the last time: go and pack.

432
00:55:45,760 --> 00:55:50,436
You want to see me dead!
That's it, isn't it?

433
00:55:51,480 --> 00:55:55,837
Let me go!
-She's staying here. Momone!

434
00:55:56,040 --> 00:55:58,110
Edith, don't let them!

435
00:55:59,960 --> 00:56:03,555
My things! I don't have any things!
Do you hear that, you shit?

436
00:56:04,320 --> 00:56:07,710
Momone, no!

437
00:56:16,160 --> 00:56:18,276
Papa Leplée...

438
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:24,151
Oh, Papa Leplée...

439
00:56:32,600 --> 00:56:35,034
You killed him.
Where's the money?

440
00:56:37,400 --> 00:56:40,233
What can you expect from
a former whore?

441
00:57:20,640 --> 00:57:24,918
Everybody out of the dressing room!
Mamy, you stay.

442
00:57:31,440 --> 00:57:34,318
I need a shot for the pain.

443
00:57:59,720 --> 00:58:01,711
Get the American.

444
00:58:06,320 --> 00:58:08,390
You can come in now.

445
00:58:13,360 --> 00:58:16,432
A triumph. You were magnificent.
-Doug?

446
00:58:19,520 --> 00:58:24,150
I need fresh air. I'm going back 
with you to Chálons.

447
00:58:26,240 --> 00:58:29,312
But that's 400 kilometres away.

448
00:58:30,640 --> 00:58:34,394
You can go to hell!
I'm sick of you all!

449
00:58:34,600 --> 00:58:37,512
You're exhausted.
It's a long journey.

450
00:58:37,720 --> 00:58:40,996
No, no, always no!
Drop dead!

451
00:58:59,280 --> 00:59:00,713
Let's go back.

452
00:59:00,920 --> 00:59:02,353
Turn around!

453
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:06,310
You've ruined it for me!
-What's this...

454
00:59:20,160 --> 00:59:22,116
<i>The blood test is a catastrophe.</i>

455
00:59:22,320 --> 00:59:26,233
She has two broken ribs we're unable to set. 
This is going to take weeks.

456
00:59:26,600 --> 00:59:30,513
<i>I'd cancel all engagements.</i>

457
00:59:39,280 --> 00:59:41,032
It's tight enough. Please leave.

458
00:59:41,840 --> 00:59:44,593
Doctor, give me an injection so I can sing.

459
00:59:44,800 --> 00:59:47,792
My admiration knows no bounds.

460
00:59:48,520 --> 00:59:51,114
That may be, but I have none.

461
00:59:51,400 --> 00:59:53,994
Cancel the concert.
You're risking your life.

462
00:59:54,200 --> 00:59:57,397
What's life without risk?

463
00:59:57,760 --> 01:00:00,672
What would you say to a new life?
Change your surroundings.

464
01:00:01,160 --> 01:00:03,196
My what?
-Your surroundings.

465
01:00:04,160 --> 01:00:06,390
Why didn't you call me sooner?

466
01:00:06,600 --> 01:00:10,195
I was busy. I didn't know 
what you wanted of me.

467
01:00:10,520 --> 01:00:13,717
I saw you sing.
You have much to learn.

468
01:00:14,160 --> 01:00:16,549
No one's ever said that before.

469
01:00:16,760 --> 01:00:21,038
In three months' time you won't be that<i>'</i>girl<i>'</i> 
any more. Your bar days are over.

470
01:00:21,240 --> 01:00:23,549
<i>He had clear blue eyes</i>
<i>That flashed like lightning</i>

471
01:00:23,760 --> 01:00:26,228
<i>in a storm in the night</i>

472
01:00:27,480 --> 01:00:30,916
In-a-storm-in-the-night!
Articulation!

473
01:00:31,720 --> 01:00:32,789
Again!

474
01:00:34,400 --> 01:00:36,231
<i>He had clear blue eyes</i>

475
01:00:37,760 --> 01:00:41,389
Are those words or noises?

476
01:00:41,600 --> 01:00:44,114
What do want of me?
-Perfect diction!

477
01:00:44,320 --> 01:00:47,471
I sing as I speak.
-Badly.

478
01:00:48,160 --> 01:00:51,869
You shout the words
and they lose their meaning.

479
01:00:54,240 --> 01:00:55,389
More slowly, Marguerite.

480
01:00:55,600 --> 01:00:57,636
We've been at it six hours.
Can someone open a window?

481
01:00:57,840 --> 01:00:59,751
We'll be doing breathing shortly.

482
01:01:00,400 --> 01:01:01,719
From the top.

483
01:01:05,400 --> 01:01:09,598
<i>He had clear blue eyes, that flashed </i>
<i>like lightning. In a storm...</i>

484
01:01:09,800 --> 01:01:12,473
You're not paying attention!
You're not creating.

485
01:01:14,160 --> 01:01:17,038
You must <i>become</i> the woman in love.

486
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:19,672
Think as an actress.

487
01:01:23,200 --> 01:01:24,519
He's making fun of me.

488
01:01:24,720 --> 01:01:27,359
We're all tired. We'll take a break.

489
01:01:29,480 --> 01:01:31,948
He makes me feel as if I can't sing.

490
01:01:32,160 --> 01:01:34,151
Who do you think you are?

491
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:37,434
Don't be satisfied with half measures.

492
01:01:38,280 --> 01:01:40,350
I've been singing since I was nine years old.

493
01:01:40,560 --> 01:01:44,269
Take it easy.
This is new and difficult.

494
01:01:44,720 --> 01:01:49,077
You're interpreting something, understand?
You must LIVE the song!

495
01:01:50,240 --> 01:01:52,515
No one's ever had a problem
with my diction before.

496
01:01:52,720 --> 01:01:55,439
No one... like whom?

497
01:01:56,040 --> 01:01:58,759
The riff-raff in Gerny<i>'</i>s?
Or on the street?

498
01:02:07,280 --> 01:02:10,113
Do what I say or go back to the gutter.

499
01:02:16,320 --> 01:02:17,833
Edith!

500
01:02:25,040 --> 01:02:28,077
Here's to my girl who never forgets her vader.

501
01:02:28,280 --> 01:02:30,032
To my little one!

502
01:02:30,280 --> 01:02:33,033
Your mentor, is he rich?

503
01:02:33,400 --> 01:02:35,630
Not a cent... He does it 
for the love of art.

504
01:02:35,840 --> 01:02:38,479
For the love of your arse you mean!

505
01:02:38,680 --> 01:02:42,878
Come on, little one, sing.
-Sing for us!

506
01:03:32,800 --> 01:03:35,075
That's the way to treat her.

507
01:03:35,680 --> 01:03:37,557
I let her have her own way.

508
01:03:39,280 --> 01:03:41,316
I was too good to her!

509
01:04:06,200 --> 01:04:08,998
You're too stiff.

510
01:04:09,200 --> 01:04:13,239
Like a bare-knuckle fighter.
Performing is an art.

511
01:04:14,080 --> 01:04:16,548
You have to grab the audience.

512
01:04:17,160 --> 01:04:20,391
You have lovely hands.
Use them.

513
01:04:20,720 --> 01:04:22,039
Sing with them.

514
01:04:22,240 --> 01:04:23,719
Again, Marguerite.

515
01:04:28,280 --> 01:04:29,713
Move them.

516
01:04:31,440 --> 01:04:32,998
The hands!

517
01:04:36,720 --> 01:04:38,039
That's it.

518
01:04:40,120 --> 01:04:42,190
I look stupid.
-Continue.

519
01:04:52,280 --> 01:04:53,633
Put this on.

520
01:04:54,720 --> 01:04:58,030
That's not what people want.
It's my voice they wish to hear.

521
01:04:58,240 --> 01:05:01,789
How can you be so talented 
and at the same time so dense?

522
01:05:27,400 --> 01:05:29,675
Open the door.
-I have to throw up!

523
01:05:29,880 --> 01:05:32,917
Is she drunk?
-She's in panic.

524
01:05:34,840 --> 01:05:36,796
The audience is waiting.

525
01:05:39,680 --> 01:05:41,989
For weeks you've been pestering me for this gig.

526
01:05:42,200 --> 01:05:45,590
For God's sake take the stage 
before the tear the place apart.

527
01:05:45,800 --> 01:05:47,233
She's on her way.

528
01:05:48,400 --> 01:05:51,392
Edith?
Three minutes.

529
01:05:51,680 --> 01:05:57,198
This isn't a bar, it's a theatre.
What am I doing here?

530
01:05:58,480 --> 01:06:01,438
Stage fright.
It's a good sign.

531
01:06:06,680 --> 01:06:07,908
Edith?

532
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:10,149
What?

533
01:06:11,840 --> 01:06:15,469
This is it.
This is what we worked hard for.

534
01:06:15,680 --> 01:06:17,636
You can't back down now.

535
01:06:20,200 --> 01:06:21,519
Open the door.

536
01:06:22,880 --> 01:06:24,916
No, I can't do it.

537
01:06:27,200 --> 01:06:28,872
Please, open the door.

538
01:06:32,360 --> 01:06:33,918
On your feet.

539
01:09:16,800 --> 01:09:19,678
Ladies and gentlemen, Edith Piaf!

540
01:09:27,160 --> 01:09:30,835
<i>...Edith Piaf Triumphs</i>...
<i>...Fame for Street Singer...</i>

541
01:09:31,600 --> 01:09:33,431
<i>...The Little Sparrow Premieres...</i>

542
01:09:35,720 --> 01:09:37,950
<i>...The first man</i>
<i>Who Helped Me...</i>

543
01:09:40,560 --> 01:09:41,788
<i>...Piaf On Tour...</i>

544
01:09:46,960 --> 01:09:49,428
<i>...Edith Piaf's Appearance</i>
<i>in the A.B.C. Theatre...</i>

545
01:10:04,720 --> 01:10:08,154
<i>The Little Sparrow is Dead</i>
<i>Long Live Edith Piaf!</i>

546
01:10:22,440 --> 01:10:27,116
<i>"I was hurrying home,</i>
<i>needing your love to lean on,</i>

547
01:10:27,320 --> 01:10:33,156
<i>...only to find an empty room.</i>
<i>Waiting and waiting; I know that room."</i>

548
01:10:33,360 --> 01:10:37,512
I can't wait to see you in this piece. 
Look out, here comes Canetti.

549
01:10:37,720 --> 01:10:41,759
The conductor's been waiting three hours.
-So?

550
01:10:41,960 --> 01:10:44,315
The premiere is less than 48 hours away.

551
01:10:44,520 --> 01:10:47,876
Do you know many people whom
Cocteau's written a piece for?

552
01:10:48,720 --> 01:10:50,438
Miss?
-Yes, Suzanne?

553
01:10:50,640 --> 01:10:54,428
Meurisse called.
Dinner with Mr. Cocteau at eight.

554
01:10:54,640 --> 01:10:56,039
You see?

555
01:10:56,240 --> 01:10:59,630
Ask him to come back at midnight. 
-Are you sure?

556
01:10:59,840 --> 01:11:03,389
You're worse than Raymond.
Do this, do that.

557
01:11:03,720 --> 01:11:06,678
That's why you fired him.
-Stop it.

558
01:11:06,880 --> 01:11:10,111
Do you wish to see the gowns?
-Yes, the gowns.

559
01:11:17,720 --> 01:11:22,032
That's all of them.
Careful with those pins.

560
01:11:22,440 --> 01:11:24,749
The simplest one, without the collar.

561
01:11:28,200 --> 01:11:31,112
There's a man at the door...
He has something for you.

562
01:11:31,320 --> 01:11:33,072
Who is it?
-A soldier.

563
01:11:33,280 --> 01:11:37,671
I told him you were busy. He's outside 
in the corridor. A bit embarrassed.

564
01:11:37,880 --> 01:11:39,996
Have him come in.

565
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:49,274
Will you come this way?

566
01:11:56,480 --> 01:11:59,950
Here she is.
-Much better without the collar.

567
01:12:00,880 --> 01:12:02,233
Yes?

568
01:12:02,680 --> 01:12:05,478
My name is Michel Emer.
I'm a corporal.

569
01:12:05,680 --> 01:12:08,433
This isn't the army.
What do you want?

570
01:12:11,960 --> 01:12:13,359
I have a song for you.

571
01:12:13,560 --> 01:12:18,190
Not another... I've enough already.
I have a premiere in two days' time.

572
01:12:18,400 --> 01:12:19,753
I wish this one.

573
01:12:19,960 --> 01:12:22,155
Tomorrow I leave for the front.

574
01:12:25,880 --> 01:12:28,440
There's the piano.
You have five minutes.

575
01:12:32,920 --> 01:12:34,319
Edith...

576
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:38,911
We shall have to wait.

577
01:13:15,080 --> 01:13:16,513
Stop.

578
01:13:18,400 --> 01:13:19,958
I want it.

579
01:13:20,320 --> 01:13:21,799
Everybody out.

580
01:13:23,520 --> 01:13:26,273
You can't mean that.
We're already late.

581
01:13:26,480 --> 01:13:28,072
What can't she mean?

582
01:13:28,280 --> 01:13:30,794
Play it.
I want it for Bobino.

583
01:13:34,440 --> 01:13:35,953
You can't do that.

584
01:13:36,160 --> 01:13:39,994
Edith Piaf can do whatever she pleases!

585
01:13:48,080 --> 01:13:49,832
French, please.

586
01:13:50,040 --> 01:13:53,749
She's too hopeless, too poor...
-Help us out here, Charles.

587
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:55,831
I'm no translator.

588
01:13:56,240 --> 01:14:01,792
<i>'</i>Miserable. And not in the French
tradition of the <i>Can-Can</i> and <i>Gay Paris.'</i>

589
01:14:02,080 --> 01:14:03,354
A complete flop.

590
01:14:03,560 --> 01:14:06,950
This isn't the first time I've had to fight.

591
01:14:07,280 --> 01:14:09,874
The Americans want pretty girls, not me.

592
01:14:10,080 --> 01:14:13,550
I'm not the Parisian sex bomb 
you were hoping for.

593
01:14:13,760 --> 01:14:18,436
Can you picture me in a ballet?
With a feather in my arse?

594
01:14:25,440 --> 01:14:28,079
Go ahead and laugh.
I'm not what they want.

595
01:14:28,320 --> 01:14:31,551
They think I'm too doleful, THEY are stupid.
-Yes, too stupid.

596
01:14:31,880 --> 01:14:35,236


597
01:14:36,320 --> 01:14:38,038


598
01:14:40,720 --> 01:14:42,950
You made the front page.
-Two columns.

599
01:14:43,160 --> 01:14:44,388


600
01:14:44,600 --> 01:14:48,718


601
01:14:48,920 --> 01:14:51,673


602
01:14:58,480 --> 01:15:00,948
I can't read it.
Translate it.

603
01:15:01,160 --> 01:15:06,359
He says that she shouldn't let you go. 
That it would be a mistake.

604
01:15:06,560 --> 01:15:09,074
The Americans don't deserve you.

605
01:15:10,200 --> 01:15:13,158
I knew something would happen!
I have to change...

606
01:15:13,480 --> 01:15:15,755
...Ginou, help me help me choose a dress.

607
01:15:17,480 --> 01:15:20,392
I'm going out tonight. I have a date.

608
01:15:29,320 --> 01:15:30,639


609
01:15:34,360 --> 01:15:37,238
What's this, Marcel?
-Beef...try it.

610
01:15:40,240 --> 01:15:42,037
It smells like damp dog.

611
01:15:43,360 --> 01:15:45,669


612
01:15:45,960 --> 01:15:46,631
What?

613
01:15:46,920 --> 01:15:49,912


614
01:15:50,120 --> 01:15:51,473


615
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:55,673
Your English is as good as the meat.

616
01:16:02,480 --> 01:16:04,198
Don't you like it here?

617
01:16:05,200 --> 01:16:07,589
I was taken a bit by surprise.
I didn't expect it...

618
01:16:08,600 --> 01:16:15,756
...when you phoned to say that as two French 
people in New York we should have a meal...

619
01:16:16,440 --> 01:16:20,228
...I didn't expect this.
-I come here all the time.

620
01:16:24,400 --> 01:16:27,278
You sure know how to spoil a girl.

621
01:16:39,440 --> 01:16:43,400
Have you decided?
-Twee broodjes pastrami.

622
01:16:44,280 --> 01:16:51,470
I'll handle this: two Tournedos Rossini,
and a bottle of Chateau Langelus 1938.

623
01:16:55,960 --> 01:17:00,078
Are you hungry?
-It's better than cooked dog.

624
01:17:01,120 --> 01:17:02,519
I'm sorry.

625
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:05,833
Let's start over. Okay?

626
01:17:07,400 --> 01:17:11,678
How long have you been in New York?
-Eight weeks.

627
01:17:12,040 --> 01:17:16,431
And do you like America?
-It doesn't interest me at all.

628
01:17:16,640 --> 01:17:18,790
I don't understand them,
and they don't understand me.

629
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:21,434
You must miss Paris.
-Terribly.

630
01:17:21,640 --> 01:17:24,108
What do you do when you're not singing?

631
01:17:26,200 --> 01:17:30,034
Your like the police with your questions. I knit.

632
01:17:30,800 --> 01:17:34,270
Give me your size and I'll knit you a sweater.

633
01:17:34,480 --> 01:17:35,913
No, but thanks all the same...

634
01:17:37,960 --> 01:17:41,032
Those people recognized you.
-Really?

635
01:17:43,800 --> 01:17:48,476
They said: <i>'</i>That schmuck lost his
recent fights. He's washed up.<i>'</i>

636
01:17:48,680 --> 01:17:51,240
I'll show them who's washed up.
-No!

637
01:17:52,080 --> 01:17:54,833
Relax. I was joking.

638
01:18:06,680 --> 01:18:08,079
It's fine.

639
01:18:18,360 --> 01:18:21,272
Can we be less formal to each other?
-Of course.

640
01:18:21,960 --> 01:18:25,953
What do you do when you aren't boxing?
-I train and I run...

641
01:18:26,160 --> 01:18:30,631
And after the training?
-ln Morocco I work on my farm.

642
01:18:31,320 --> 01:18:33,072
You have a farm?

643
01:18:33,680 --> 01:18:35,432
I breed pigs.

644
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:41,797
Well, why not?

645
01:18:45,040 --> 01:18:46,871
Absolutely. Why not?

646
01:18:47,080 --> 01:18:50,152
It's a fine farm: modern, with superb, fat pigs.

647
01:18:50,440 --> 01:18:53,352
Who takes care of them when you're boxing?
-My wife.

648
01:19:01,520 --> 01:19:02,919
You have...

649
01:19:04,160 --> 01:19:05,479
...wonderful hands.

650
01:19:07,960 --> 01:19:11,714
Did you hear what I said, Momone?
-You have really beautiful fingers.

651
01:19:13,640 --> 01:19:14,959
Listen.

652
01:19:15,160 --> 01:19:17,116
What colour are your eyes?

653
01:19:17,680 --> 01:19:21,673
He leaned over...
-And his breath smelled.

654
01:19:21,880 --> 01:19:25,031
You can be such a bitch!
-He is of course a pig breeder.

655
01:19:25,240 --> 01:19:27,913
He said...
-Violet blue.

656
01:19:28,200 --> 01:19:29,918
Of course, violet blue.

657
01:19:30,400 --> 01:19:34,279
It was the way he said it.
As though he was a child.

658
01:19:35,840 --> 01:19:39,435
Then he said:
-You're just like a fairy.

659
01:19:40,440 --> 01:19:42,749
A bit of an exaggeration.

660
01:20:10,840 --> 01:20:14,150
Did you kiss him?
-I didn't dare.

661
01:20:15,520 --> 01:20:18,432
It was a wonderful evening.
-Too short.

662
01:20:21,120 --> 01:20:24,795
Will you come and see me box?
-Of course.

663
01:20:26,960 --> 01:20:29,315
Did he try to kiss you?

664
01:20:29,720 --> 01:20:31,950
I don't know if he even thought about it.

665
01:20:32,720 --> 01:20:34,199
And I'm supposed to believe that!

666
01:20:34,400 --> 01:20:36,470
I'll come to see you sing.

667
01:20:40,360 --> 01:20:42,032
Goodnight.

668
01:20:46,200 --> 01:20:48,475
He's the love of my life...

669
01:22:17,640 --> 01:22:19,790
You were superb.

670
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:23,834
Mr. Lucien Roupp,
Mr. Cerdan's manager.

671
01:22:24,200 --> 01:22:27,670
Mr. Jameson,
of CBS television.

672
01:22:27,880 --> 01:22:30,758


673
01:22:42,360 --> 01:22:43,588
Marlene.

674
01:22:46,680 --> 01:22:50,798
Good evening. I'm sorry, I just 
wanted to say something.

675
01:22:53,200 --> 01:22:55,953
I haven't been in Paris in years.

676
01:22:56,240 --> 01:23:01,394
But this evening, when you sang
I was right back there again...

677
01:23:01,840 --> 01:23:04,354
...on her streets, beneath her skies.

678
01:23:04,760 --> 01:23:07,991
Your voice is the soul of Paris.

679
01:23:08,440 --> 01:23:12,513
You took me with you on your travels.
You brought tears to my eyes.

680
01:23:13,800 --> 01:23:18,032
Thank you, from the bottom of my heart.
-Thank you.

681
01:23:54,920 --> 01:23:56,433
Come on.

682
01:24:02,680 --> 01:24:07,356
I'm beginning to like this city.
The stars are out tonight.

683
01:24:07,960 --> 01:24:09,678
Let's go.

684
01:24:24,240 --> 01:24:28,153
Marc, do you know how long
a frog lives for?

685
01:24:29,200 --> 01:24:31,191
In fairytales or in real life?

686
01:24:33,720 --> 01:24:37,235
No one ever read me fairytales.

687
01:24:37,760 --> 01:24:40,228
You never had the chance to hear them.

688
01:24:41,280 --> 01:24:44,477
That's true, but all the same...

689
01:25:30,400 --> 01:25:34,393
Dreux. 13 December 1959

690
01:26:13,960 --> 01:26:15,313
I'm a little tired.

691
01:26:17,360 --> 01:26:18,429
I'll be right back.

692
01:26:37,760 --> 01:26:39,512
Lay her down there.

693
01:26:47,200 --> 01:26:49,714
I'll go back on in a minute.
-Out of the question.

694
01:26:49,920 --> 01:26:51,797
Nobody tells ME when to stop.

695
01:26:52,560 --> 01:26:55,950
What are we going to do?
-Sorry, you'll have to clear the house.

696
01:26:56,480 --> 01:26:58,755
I'm going back there!
-No, Edith.

697
01:26:58,960 --> 01:27:01,428
I have to continue.
-It would be suicide.

698
01:27:01,640 --> 01:27:02,914
You're going to hospital.

699
01:27:04,600 --> 01:27:07,672
No, I'm begging you!

700
01:27:07,880 --> 01:27:12,510
She left hospital only three weeks ago. 
There'll be more galas.

701
01:27:13,360 --> 01:27:16,318
Take me back to the stage.

702
01:27:17,040 --> 01:27:19,270
I have to sing.

703
01:27:19,480 --> 01:27:22,392
I have to sing, Louis.
I have no choice.

704
01:27:23,240 --> 01:27:25,913
Edith, please...

705
01:27:26,520 --> 01:27:29,193
Can't you hear them?
-Stop...

706
01:27:30,480 --> 01:27:31,708
Shut that door!

707
01:27:32,240 --> 01:27:33,798
Take me back there, Louis.

708
01:27:34,320 --> 01:27:37,915
If I don't sing tonight...

709
01:27:38,520 --> 01:27:45,198
If I don't sing one song at least,
I'll lose faith in myself. Do you follow?

710
01:27:59,840 --> 01:28:00,989
Doctor...

711
01:28:02,760 --> 01:28:04,432
...do what you have to do.

712
01:28:29,560 --> 01:28:32,677
Not this time, boys.

713
01:28:33,040 --> 01:28:36,316
You think I'm going to collapse,
but I'm in great shape.

714
01:28:36,520 --> 01:28:39,273
Don't you dare write that this is my suicide tour!

715
01:28:44,480 --> 01:28:45,799
<i>'Padam'!</i>

716
01:30:12,720 --> 01:30:15,951
<i>Saint Theresa,</i>
<i>first of all my thanks...</i>

717
01:30:16,840 --> 01:30:21,516
<i>I know you're behind it all.</i>
<i>You sent him to me.</i>

718
01:30:22,480 --> 01:30:26,155
<i>I've found love,</i>
<i>thanks to you.</i>

719
01:30:26,960 --> 01:30:30,430
<i>Baby Jesus,</i>
<i>protect Marcel.</i>

720
01:31:43,640 --> 01:31:44,789
Come on, Marcel!

721
01:31:47,160 --> 01:31:48,115
No!

722
01:31:48,480 --> 01:31:51,631
It's too early, Edith.
-He's going to win. I feel it.

723
01:31:52,160 --> 01:31:54,310
If things go wrong, you've a problem.
-What do you mean?

724
01:31:56,960 --> 01:31:59,633
If there's no problem,
I'll call you. Now go.

725
01:32:11,640 --> 01:32:12,868
Hurry up!

726
01:32:28,240 --> 01:32:29,832
Come on, Marcel!

727
01:32:45,880 --> 01:32:47,871
One more round!

728
01:33:02,320 --> 01:33:03,753
Come on, Marcel!

729
01:33:08,320 --> 01:33:09,799
Finish him off!

730
01:33:46,720 --> 01:33:49,188
What's happening?
-Zale is sitting it out.

731
01:34:16,600 --> 01:34:18,875
Did he do it?
Is he the world champion?

732
01:35:18,400 --> 01:35:20,436
You look like an angel.

733
01:35:22,240 --> 01:35:24,356
Not a fairy any more?

734
01:35:30,960 --> 01:35:32,757
You're my champion.

735
01:35:32,960 --> 01:35:35,349
I want to be with you always.

736
01:35:35,920 --> 01:35:39,230
There was nothing before I met you.
All that is in the past.

737
01:35:43,600 --> 01:35:45,272
Stay with me.

738
01:35:49,560 --> 01:35:53,633
<i>My dearest, before going to bed last night</i>
<i>I crossed off a day...</i>

739
01:35:53,840 --> 01:35:56,877
<i>...a day that was long and short.</i>

740
01:35:57,080 --> 01:36:02,757
<i>Such pain, that plane flew away with my heart. 
My life, my breath...</i>

741
01:36:02,960 --> 01:36:06,111
<i>...my sweet boy,</i>
<i>my child, my dearest love...</i>

742
01:36:06,320 --> 01:36:10,950
<i>...your scent is still on my sheets,</i>
<i>and my heart sleeps without waking...</i>

743
01:36:11,160 --> 01:36:13,310
<i>...in the arms of sadness.

744
01:36:13,520 --> 01:36:17,911
<i>Darling, I love you.</i>
<i>What have you done to me?</i>

745
01:36:18,200 --> 01:36:19,155
<i>I miss you.</i>

746
01:36:19,360 --> 01:36:23,638
<i>I'm depressed, lifeless,</i>
<i>as though I'm waiting for something...</i>

747
01:36:23,880 --> 01:36:31,309
<i>...hold me close against your heart and know 
that nothing means more to me than you.</i>

748
01:36:31,720 --> 01:36:36,271
<i>Bring me back my heart.</i>

749
01:36:36,480 --> 01:36:40,029
<i>Whenever I'm in a restaurant and 
hear 'La Vie en Rose'...</i>

750
01:36:40,240 --> 01:36:46,634
<i>If I see, my love, how devoted you are
to your wife and children...</i>

751
01:36:46,840 --> 01:36:48,717
<i>...I have the urge to go far away...</i>

752
01:36:48,920 --> 01:36:53,232
<i>...and perhaps one day you'll be 
grateful for what I've done.</i>

753
01:36:53,440 --> 01:36:57,672
<i>I can't have you to myself and 
I can't live without you.</i>

754
01:36:57,880 --> 01:37:01,475
<i>As God is my witness, 
I ask nothing for myself...</i>

755
01:37:01,680 --> 01:37:04,194
<i>...and am prepared to sacrifice everything.</i>

756
01:37:06,040 --> 01:37:08,998
<i>'If life were to take you from me...</i>

757
01:37:09,200 --> 01:37:13,512
<i>...if you should die or be far away,</i>
<i>and you were to love me, I too would die.'</i>

758
01:37:18,200 --> 01:37:21,988
In three months' time,
wait for it, in April...

759
01:37:22,280 --> 01:37:26,796
...I'm going to star in <i>L'Olympia.</i>
Full house and then we're back again.

760
01:37:27,200 --> 01:37:30,795
Your liver is damaged...

761
01:37:31,000 --> 01:37:33,992
...you've been ill and need rest. 
It's serious this time.

762
01:37:34,200 --> 01:37:36,714
I'm only 44.
I'm not dead yet.

763
01:37:36,920 --> 01:37:39,912
Because of all the cancellations
we're broke.

764
01:37:40,120 --> 01:37:42,190
Oh, so it's my fault?

765
01:37:42,400 --> 01:37:45,756
I didn't say that. 
The taxman is breathing down our necks.

766
01:37:46,200 --> 01:37:48,953
We have to pay 120.000 <i>franc</i>.

767
01:37:49,520 --> 01:37:54,389
I only have jaundice! That won't last
100 years. Don't exaggerate.

768
01:37:55,120 --> 01:37:57,873
I want to sing in <i>L'Olympia</i>.

769
01:38:04,360 --> 01:38:08,558
Anything else?
-We shouldn't give in all the time.

770
01:38:08,760 --> 01:38:13,356
I can't watch her all the time. She 
discharged herself too soon from hospital.

771
01:38:13,560 --> 01:38:17,439
<i>L'Olympia</i> is in 3 months.
That's going to be a disaster.

772
01:38:17,640 --> 01:38:21,315
She needs this sort of challenge.
-This is hopeless.

773
01:38:21,520 --> 01:38:25,149
In that case I'll have to tell the insurers 
that we're cancelling everything.

774
01:38:25,360 --> 01:38:29,069
We have to make the decisions for her. 
Whether she likes it or not.

775
01:39:21,120 --> 01:39:24,430
I said to myself,
<i>'</i>Edith, it's over.<i>'</i>

776
01:39:24,640 --> 01:39:27,837
There's someone else. You've lost him.
-Did he have an affair?

777
01:39:28,040 --> 01:39:30,918
I he did have, would I be telling you?

778
01:39:31,280 --> 01:39:33,714
He left the restaurant.
I followed him.

779
01:39:33,920 --> 01:39:38,994
My Marcel walked the whole of New York 
to eat with an old blind boxer...

780
01:39:39,200 --> 01:39:43,591
...whom he'd met a couple of years before. 
Can you imagine that?

781
01:39:44,560 --> 01:39:50,112
Men like that are scarce.
-My Marcel...

782
01:39:50,520 --> 01:39:53,751
...that's all you ever talk about.
That's the only thing that counts.

783
01:39:57,320 --> 01:40:01,598
But listen, Ginou,
I'll never have him.

784
01:40:02,200 --> 01:40:06,079
He'll never be mine.
He'll remain with his wife and children.

785
01:40:11,440 --> 01:40:13,749
He phones her every day.

786
01:40:15,120 --> 01:40:19,079
I pretend I don't know what's going on.
I want him to be happy.

787
01:40:21,440 --> 01:40:22,714
I'll be right back.

788
01:40:27,920 --> 01:40:29,876
<i>I</i> could have been Edith Piaf.

789
01:40:30,600 --> 01:40:32,955
There's more in life than chansons.

790
01:40:43,840 --> 01:40:47,879
It's been too long, Marcel!
Call <i>Orly.</i> Book a flight this evening.

791
01:40:48,280 --> 01:40:52,910
SUCH a long ocean sailing: I'd never survive it. 
I miss you, Marcel.

792
01:40:53,440 --> 01:40:55,874
I can't bear to be apart from you.

793
01:40:56,960 --> 01:41:00,396
Perhaps I have to return to Paris.
-Hold on.

794
01:41:00,600 --> 01:41:04,354
I'm no more than Madame's lapdog.
-Stop it...

795
01:41:06,360 --> 01:41:11,434
Rum, coke! Whisky!
People think I'm rubbish.

796
01:41:12,400 --> 01:41:14,436
Getting drunk in Belleville was better.

797
01:41:17,520 --> 01:41:19,351
You abandoned me.

798
01:41:19,920 --> 01:41:21,433
That's enough, Momone!

799
01:41:23,720 --> 01:41:25,438
Take her away from here.

800
01:41:30,080 --> 01:41:31,877
I'm taking the boat.

801
01:41:32,720 --> 01:41:34,711
To your career, Edith!

802
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:43,117
Marcel, leave tonight. For me.

803
01:42:33,000 --> 01:42:37,790
You won't be sleeping if I'm not there.
-Thank God for that, Marcel.

804
01:42:47,720 --> 01:42:50,996
I'll make you coffee.
You stay where you are.

805
01:42:57,280 --> 01:42:59,271
Let me serve you.

806
01:43:15,840 --> 01:43:17,751
What are you doing here?

807
01:43:35,000 --> 01:43:36,877
I knew you'd come.

808
01:43:39,280 --> 01:43:42,113
Lucien found it hard to get tickets.

809
01:43:47,360 --> 01:43:49,032
I've a gift for you.

810
01:43:52,080 --> 01:43:56,153
You don't look too well.
You could do with some sun. You're pale.

811
01:44:05,120 --> 01:44:06,348
Ginou!

812
01:44:07,960 --> 01:44:09,916
I'm looking for that watch!

813
01:44:16,280 --> 01:44:19,477
Wat nou?
I'm looking for that watch!

814
01:44:19,680 --> 01:44:23,719
In the red Cartier box.
Shit, it was right here!

815
01:44:32,720 --> 01:44:33,914
What's the matter with you?

816
01:44:34,120 --> 01:44:37,908
I'm looking for Marcel's watch!
Where is that watch?

817
01:44:42,680 --> 01:44:46,719
I'm looking for Marcel's watch!
What?

818
01:44:48,320 --> 01:44:51,756
Louis? What's the matter?

819
01:44:54,000 --> 01:44:56,116
I want you to be brave, Edith.

820
01:44:58,040 --> 01:44:59,519
Is it Marcel?

821
01:45:01,000 --> 01:45:02,319
What?

822
01:45:05,080 --> 01:45:06,991
The plane crashed...

823
01:45:25,160 --> 01:45:26,388
Marcel!

824
01:45:29,360 --> 01:45:30,952
Marcel!

825
01:47:02,920 --> 01:47:05,229
What more can I tell you?

826
01:47:06,280 --> 01:47:07,998
They say you're the best clairvoyant there is.

827
01:47:08,200 --> 01:47:12,990
This is your third visit this week.
I've told you all I know.

828
01:47:13,360 --> 01:47:15,112
Why do you keep coming back?

829
01:47:16,840 --> 01:47:19,308
So you can tell me again.

830
01:47:20,720 --> 01:47:23,712
So that I know why I should continue living.

831
01:47:25,200 --> 01:47:28,192
He died in the air, so that is where he must be...

832
01:47:39,920 --> 01:47:42,388
<i>California, August 1955</i>

833
01:47:50,480 --> 01:47:55,474
Jack Peals! Can we go any faster?
I need air.

834
01:47:55,680 --> 01:47:58,148
I love the heat.
It makes me dizzy.

835
01:47:59,040 --> 01:48:01,554
Step on it.
Our pin-up is melting!

836
01:48:02,920 --> 01:48:08,199
I'm getting a sore throat. Then you can take care of me. 
Like a good husband.

837
01:48:08,400 --> 01:48:11,995
The best I've had.
-The FIRST you've had!

838
01:48:13,360 --> 01:48:16,033
Are you going to spend the day gawping at up?

839
01:48:19,440 --> 01:48:21,032
I'm feeling nauseous.

840
01:48:21,480 --> 01:48:24,358
Look out, you'll drive us off the road.

841
01:48:25,280 --> 01:48:30,593
Let me drive. Stop, I'll drive.
Then Ginou can throw up.

842
01:48:35,880 --> 01:48:36,790
Go on, Ginou.

843
01:48:38,240 --> 01:48:39,753
May I, Madame?

844
01:48:41,880 --> 01:48:43,393
Go ahead, Ginou!

845
01:48:44,040 --> 01:48:46,190
Very good!

846
01:48:52,000 --> 01:48:53,069
Bye bye, Ginou!

847
01:48:53,960 --> 01:48:55,632
Wait for me!

848
01:48:59,480 --> 01:49:00,959
My, you're some driver.

849
01:49:04,000 --> 01:49:08,835
Our journey hasn't been wasted after all.
We just murdered a tree.

850
01:49:16,840 --> 01:49:21,356
My God, the service here is awful.
Can nobody take our order?

851
01:49:22,520 --> 01:49:27,275
Take it easy. You're no star here.
<i>Mocambo</i> is tonight.

852
01:49:27,480 --> 01:49:31,234
Remind me who invited us.

853
01:49:31,440 --> 01:49:35,194
Marlon Brando, Ginger Rogers,
Mr. Chaplin...

854
01:49:39,000 --> 01:49:40,513
What's this?

855
01:49:42,160 --> 01:49:46,073
We didn't order that swill!
-That's your cocktail.

856
01:49:55,000 --> 01:49:58,231
Don't touch me!
I said don't touch me!

857
01:49:58,800 --> 01:50:00,552
Here, wipe it off.

858
01:50:03,080 --> 01:50:05,071
We should get a divorce.

859
01:50:09,760 --> 01:50:13,116
How many times a day are you shooting up now?

860
01:50:14,000 --> 01:50:15,638
About ten.

861
01:50:16,960 --> 01:50:22,353
Excuse me for being so direct, but why do you do it?

862
01:50:25,480 --> 01:50:27,596
So that my body doesn't protest.

863
01:50:31,240 --> 01:50:35,153
When did you start injecting every day?

864
01:50:35,360 --> 01:50:38,557
Five years ago, after the plane crash.

865
01:50:38,760 --> 01:50:43,197
I contracted rheumatism.
I couldn't knit any more.

866
01:50:45,120 --> 01:50:47,918
You're very dependent on it.

867
01:50:48,840 --> 01:50:51,673
It's an addiction...
-Doctor?

868
01:50:52,160 --> 01:50:54,720
I want my wife to kick the habit.

869
01:50:57,560 --> 01:51:00,757
I want to be well again. I can do it.

870
01:51:05,480 --> 01:51:09,837
October 1960 - 5 years later

871
01:51:30,000 --> 01:51:32,070
Danielle, a chair!

872
01:51:41,280 --> 01:51:42,633
Edith?

873
01:51:49,520 --> 01:51:51,078
Here you are.

874
01:51:51,920 --> 01:51:53,353
Sit down now.

875
01:52:03,600 --> 01:52:04,874
Bruno...

876
01:52:10,480 --> 01:52:12,710
...there won't be another <i>L'Olympia</i>.

877
01:52:19,160 --> 01:52:20,673
I understand.

878
01:52:32,160 --> 01:52:33,388
No!

879
01:52:41,560 --> 01:52:46,429
The composer Charles Dumont and 
the lyricist Michel Vaucaire are here.

880
01:52:46,640 --> 01:52:49,757
They wish us to hear their <i>chanson</i>.

881
01:52:57,560 --> 01:52:59,790
Quickly then. I'm tired.

882
01:53:16,920 --> 01:53:21,311
<i>no, no nothing at all</i>

883
01:53:22,880 --> 01:53:26,190
<i>no, I regret nothing at all</i>

884
01:53:27,240 --> 01:53:31,631
<i>not the good times I had</i>

885
01:53:32,160 --> 01:53:35,914
<i>not the pain</i>
<i>it means nothing to me</i>

886
01:53:36,120 --> 01:53:37,439
Stop!

887
01:53:38,640 --> 01:53:42,030
I love it. Carry on!

888
01:53:42,880 --> 01:53:45,474
<i>with my souvenirs</i>

889
01:53:46,040 --> 01:53:48,554
<i>I build a fire</i>

890
01:53:48,760 --> 01:53:50,751
<i>my sadness, my pleasure</i>

891
01:53:50,960 --> 01:53:53,269
<i>I don't need it any longer</i>

892
01:53:53,600 --> 01:53:55,955
<i>the loves are gone</i>

893
01:53:56,160 --> 01:53:58,435
<i>the traumas as well</i>

894
01:53:58,640 --> 01:54:01,200
<i>erased for ever</i>

895
01:54:01,400 --> 01:54:02,719
<i>I must start anew</i>

896
01:54:02,920 --> 01:54:04,558
You're wonderful!

897
01:54:04,920 --> 01:54:08,879
That's precisely what I was looking out for.
Unbelievable. This is so ME!

898
01:54:09,760 --> 01:54:11,830
That is MY life.
That is me!

899
01:54:12,160 --> 01:54:17,188
Call Coquatrix. <i>L'Olympia</i> is on!
Play it again. It's exquisite.

900
01:54:17,720 --> 01:54:21,349
<i>no, no nothing at all</i>

901
01:54:22,680 --> 01:54:26,116
<i>no, I regret nothing at all</i>

902
01:54:46,040 --> 01:54:48,918
<i>You're doing well, my dear.</i>
Your friend, Marguerite<i>'</i>

903
01:54:50,400 --> 01:54:53,676
Everyone's here: Aznavour,
Mr. Cocteau, Yves Montand.

904
01:54:53,880 --> 01:54:56,872
Montand's here?
I read that he wasn't coming.

905
01:54:57,080 --> 01:54:58,229
He's come for you!

906
01:54:58,440 --> 01:55:02,479
They've been waiting a half hour.
-The room is jumping.

907
01:55:13,920 --> 01:55:15,672
Not too tight?

908
01:55:18,280 --> 01:55:21,033
Who's that?
-A friend.

909
01:55:41,680 --> 01:55:43,750
Let's go, Edith.

910
01:55:44,000 --> 01:55:45,228
Up you get.

911
01:55:50,800 --> 01:55:52,119
My crucifix?

912
01:55:53,920 --> 01:55:54,875
My crucifix...

913
01:55:57,480 --> 01:55:58,549
My crucifix?

914
01:55:58,760 --> 01:56:01,752
I forgot. I'll fetch it.
-I won't sing without it.

915
01:56:02,840 --> 01:56:05,400
Everybody out!

916
01:57:13,400 --> 01:57:17,598
<i>Grasse, Oktober 1963</i>
<i>The Final Night</i>

917
01:57:17,920 --> 01:57:19,239
See you tomorrow.

918
01:57:19,440 --> 01:57:20,998
I'll do it.

919
01:57:26,280 --> 01:57:31,673
I'm afraid, Simone. I'm losing my memory. 
It's serious this time.

920
01:57:33,080 --> 01:57:35,469
My brain is confused.

921
01:57:35,880 --> 01:57:41,238
I try to remember things but they won't come.

922
01:57:42,960 --> 01:57:46,919
Things do come, but not the things I want.

923
01:57:49,680 --> 01:57:53,798
I wanted to see his watch.
Don't you remember? Marcel's watch?

924
01:57:54,000 --> 01:57:58,869
I'm afraid not. I never knew him.
-I wanted to see his watch...

925
01:58:16,800 --> 01:58:18,472
What a face!

926
01:58:20,160 --> 01:58:21,957
You have wild eyes.

927
01:58:25,200 --> 01:58:26,997
I like the little one.

928
01:59:00,400 --> 01:59:03,312
Simone?
-Yes, Edith?

929
01:59:05,640 --> 01:59:07,790
I haven't said my prayers.

930
01:59:10,800 --> 01:59:13,553
I must get down on my knees and pray.

931
01:59:14,000 --> 01:59:18,198
No one will think less of you if 
you don't get down on your knees.

932
01:59:18,520 --> 01:59:21,239
I wish to pray for my papa.

933
02:00:21,800 --> 02:00:23,119
Marcelle...

934
02:00:24,680 --> 02:00:25,874
Marcelle...

935
02:00:26,800 --> 02:00:28,791
...my little ghost...

936
02:00:30,800 --> 02:00:35,396
Only Momone knows.
I must tell you about my ghost.

937
02:00:35,600 --> 02:00:38,353
Take it easy, Edith.
-Marcelle!

938
02:00:47,120 --> 02:00:50,396
Marcelle, go to bed. Enough for today.

939
02:00:50,600 --> 02:00:56,391
And I'm supposed to look out for the police 
- and your child! What Louis up to?

940
02:00:57,760 --> 02:00:59,239
It's your father .

941
02:01:03,960 --> 02:01:05,154
Has she eaten?

942
02:01:05,440 --> 02:01:09,115
They're saying you were on the street with her.
-Who says that?

943
02:01:09,320 --> 02:01:12,437
You only have her twice a month 
and you can't even do THAT right!

944
02:01:12,680 --> 02:01:14,193
I told you: not on the street!

945
02:01:23,600 --> 02:01:24,430
Come quick.

946
02:01:27,320 --> 02:01:28,036
It's Marcelle!
Come quick!

947
02:01:32,640 --> 02:01:34,153
She's in the hospital!

948
02:01:55,920 --> 02:01:57,797
Are you her mother?

949
02:01:58,360 --> 02:02:03,115
Meningitis. We could do nothing. I'm sorry.

950
02:02:36,280 --> 02:02:37,713
Edith?

951
02:02:39,160 --> 02:02:40,957
I have the crucifix.

952
02:02:58,960 --> 02:03:01,349
They told me you were on the beach.

953
02:03:02,240 --> 02:03:06,279
Thanks for agreeing to this interview.
-My pleasure.

954
02:03:07,360 --> 02:03:09,794
How strange to meet you so far from Paris.

955
02:03:10,000 --> 02:03:12,389
I'm never far from Paris.

956
02:03:13,280 --> 02:03:18,308
I have a list of question.
Just say the first thing that occurs to you.

957
02:03:24,400 --> 02:03:27,836
What is your favourite colour?
-Blue.

958
02:03:28,040 --> 02:03:31,874
Your favourite food?
-Roast beef.

959
02:03:33,480 --> 02:03:38,508
Would you like to live sensibly?
-I already do.

960
02:03:42,600 --> 02:03:47,355
<i>Who are your most loyal friends?</i>
-<i>All my genuine friends.</i>

961
02:03:49,560 --> 02:03:52,199
<i>If you were unable to sing...</i>

962
02:03:52,880 --> 02:03:56,156
<i>Then I could no longer live.</i>

963
02:03:57,160 --> 02:03:59,037
<i>Are you afraid of death?</i>

964
02:04:00,480 --> 02:04:02,869
<i>I'm more afraid of loneliness.</i>

965
02:04:04,360 --> 02:04:09,070
<i>Do you pray?</i>
-<i>Yes, for I believe in love.</i>

966
02:04:10,240 --> 02:04:12,196
I don't want to, Simone.

967
02:04:13,160 --> 02:04:16,835
Where's Theo? I want my husband.

968
02:04:17,120 --> 02:04:19,509
Theo will be here in less than an hour.

969
02:04:20,560 --> 02:04:23,313
<i>What was the finest part of the show for you?</i>

970
02:04:24,240 --> 02:04:26,356
<i>When the curtain went up.</i>

971
02:04:41,360 --> 02:04:43,590
<i>And as a woman?</i>

972
02:04:44,800 --> 02:04:46,791
<i>My first kiss.</i>

973
02:04:48,800 --> 02:04:53,316
<i>Do you like the night?</i>
-<i>Yes, with lots of light.</i>

974
02:04:53,520 --> 02:04:58,036
<i>The morning?</i>
-<i>With a piano and friends.</i>

975
02:04:58,240 --> 02:04:59,434
<i>The evening?</i>

976
02:04:59,680 --> 02:05:02,353
<i>Because that's our morning.</i>

977
02:05:07,680 --> 02:05:09,750
You see, you're breathing.

978
02:05:17,440 --> 02:05:19,351
I can't go back.

979
02:05:23,120 --> 02:05:24,872
I can't.

980
02:06:02,360 --> 02:06:05,909
<i>What advice would you give a woman?</i>

981
02:06:07,280 --> 02:06:08,599
<i>Love.</i>

982
02:06:08,840 --> 02:06:11,638
<i>To a young girl?</i>
-<i>Love.</i>

983
02:06:11,840 --> 02:06:15,150
<i>To a child?</i>
-<i>Love.</i>

984
02:06:18,160 --> 02:06:20,276
Whom are you knitting for?

985
02:06:21,880 --> 02:06:24,633
For anyone who'll wear my sweaters.

986
02:06:26,280 --> 02:06:29,955
That's it. I hope it wasn't too long.

987
02:06:32,160 --> 02:06:35,550
Thank you so much, madame.
-Thank you too.
