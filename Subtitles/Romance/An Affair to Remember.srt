00:10:04,729 --> 00:10:07,189
this trip shouldn't
be pink champagne?

179
00:10:07,691 --> 00:10:09,525
Mmm-hmm.
What?

180
00:10:13,196 --> 00:10:14,405
Oh, dear.

181
00:10:14,656 --> 00:10:16,198
(CLEARS THROAT)

182
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:21,287
He wouldn't like it?

183
00:10:21,371 --> 00:10:22,454
No.

184
00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:24,373
Husband?
No.

185
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:26,375
He still
wouldn't like it?
No.

186
00:10:28,753 --> 00:10:30,754
Why isn't he
traveling with you?

187
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:33,299
Because he had
to go to Texas
on a big merger.

188
00:10:33,383 --> 00:10:34,466
Ah.

189
00:10:34,551 --> 00:10:36,135
He thought it'd
be a good idea

190
00:10:36,219 --> 00:10:38,971
if I took a little trip
while he consummated
this big deal

191
00:10:39,055 --> 00:10:41,557
because I have no
head for business.

192
00:10:41,766 --> 00:10:45,185
It's beyond me
how the more money
a corporation loses,

193
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:46,312
the more money
it makes,

194
00:10:46,396 --> 00:10:48,564
because of
the carryovers
with the write-offs.

195
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:50,274
The big secret
seems to be

196
00:10:50,358 --> 00:10:51,692
to merge
a sick corporation

197
00:10:51,776 --> 00:10:53,152
with a big,
fat, healthy one

198
00:10:53,528 --> 00:10:55,237
and then everybody
gets well.

199
00:10:55,405 --> 00:10:56,488
Silly, isn't it?

200
00:10:56,573 --> 00:10:57,656
He doesn't think
I'm dumb,

201
00:10:57,741 --> 00:11:01,785
but he doesn't think
I'm very bright
about things like that.

202
00:11:02,078 --> 00:11:04,079
Well, it isn't
necessary, is it?

203
00:11:04,331 --> 00:11:06,165
Thank you.
That's all right.

204
00:11:07,334 --> 00:11:10,044
Well, so he trusts you?

205
00:11:10,128 --> 00:11:11,211
Implicitly.

206
00:11:12,505 --> 00:11:14,423
No mistakes,
no errors,

207
00:11:14,507 --> 00:11:16,633
no tiny
little slips?
Five faithful years.

208
00:11:16,718 --> 00:11:17,718
Ah.

209
00:11:17,802 --> 00:11:20,220
Sounds awful,
doesn't it,
but it's true.

210
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:22,264
Yes.
Well, there you are.

211
00:11:22,349 --> 00:11:23,474
(CHUCKLING)

212
00:11:23,558 --> 00:11:24,975
Cigarette?
No, thank you.

213
00:11:27,187 --> 00:11:28,771
Oh, I don't...

214
00:11:29,397 --> 00:11:31,899
You could light it
from that inscription,
couldn't you?

215
00:11:31,983 --> 00:11:35,277
Oh. Oh, I like that.
I must stay tuned
into you.

216
00:11:35,695 --> 00:11:38,530
Yes. He's a very
lucky fellow.

217
00:11:38,615 --> 00:11:39,907
Must be
a remarkable man.

218
00:11:40,408 --> 00:11:42,743
Well, you can imagine
how attractive he is

219
00:11:42,827 --> 00:11:46,288
when I can resist
so charming a person
as...

220
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:49,958
Yes. Yes.
I understand.

221
00:11:50,043 --> 00:11:51,418
Well, it was nice,
wasn't it?

222
00:11:51,503 --> 00:11:53,045
(CLEARS THROAT)

223
00:11:53,296 --> 00:11:54,380
Oh, well.

224
00:11:54,464 --> 00:11:56,215
Well, there's still
deck tennis,
shuffleboard, bingo.

225
00:11:58,802 --> 00:12:00,844
Well, don't tell me
you're embarrassed.

226
00:12:01,763 --> 00:12:03,764
Yes. Yes, as a matter
of fact, I am.

227
00:12:03,848 --> 00:12:05,516
Oh, I am sorry.

228
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:06,642
It's all right.
Don't apologize.

229
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:09,061
I do hope
it won't affect
your ego because...

230
00:12:09,145 --> 00:12:11,021
No, please.
Please, don't think
anything of it.

231
00:12:11,106 --> 00:12:13,273
I'll just take
my ego for a walk.

232
00:12:13,817 --> 00:12:15,442
Unless, of course,
you'd care to...

233
00:12:15,527 --> 00:12:16,568
Have dinner
with you?
Mmm.

234
00:12:16,653 --> 00:12:18,070
I'd love to.

235
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:28,080
Here comes
my friend Ferrante now.

236
00:12:28,164 --> 00:12:31,250
Oh, Mr. Ferrante,
I'd like to have you meet
my sister, Miss Hathaway

237
00:12:31,334 --> 00:12:33,335
and my wife,
Mrs. Hathaway...

238
00:12:34,337 --> 00:12:35,504
(LAUGHS)

239
00:12:41,177 --> 00:12:43,512
And when
you were little,

240
00:12:43,805 --> 00:12:46,473
what did your nurse
read to you at bedtime?

241
00:12:46,558 --> 00:12:47,599
Let me see...

242
00:12:47,684 --> 00:12:49,268
The Memoirs
of Casanova?

243
00:12:49,352 --> 00:12:52,146
Every night,
and then we'd
turn out the light.

244
00:12:52,230 --> 00:12:53,272
"We"?

245
00:12:53,356 --> 00:12:54,731
I was only so big.

246
00:12:55,316 --> 00:12:57,317
You must've had
a happy childhood.

247
00:12:57,402 --> 00:12:58,610
Ah, yes.

248
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:00,904
And women?

249
00:13:00,989 --> 00:13:02,072
Oh, women.

250
00:13:02,532 --> 00:13:04,283
You've known
quite a few,
haven't you?

251
00:13:04,367 --> 00:13:05,576
I don't know.

252
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:07,411
Or perhaps "few"
is the wrong word.

253
00:13:07,537 --> 00:13:09,663
Let's say
it's not precise.

254
00:13:09,747 --> 00:13:11,457
I beg your pardon,
Signor Ferrante.

255
00:13:11,541 --> 00:13:14,460
Would you like me
to reserve this table
for you every night?

256
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:17,671
Why not?

257
00:13:17,755 --> 00:13:18,755
Thank you.

258
00:13:19,549 --> 00:13:21,049
Now, where were we?

259
00:13:21,134 --> 00:13:23,510
And I suppose
they've all been madly
in love with you?

260
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:25,137
I doubt it.

261
00:13:25,221 --> 00:13:27,097
But you haven't had
much respect for them.

262
00:13:27,182 --> 00:13:28,432
On the contrary...

263
00:13:28,516 --> 00:13:30,726
Still, you've always
been very fair
in your judgments.

264
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:34,146
Yes. I've been
more than fair.
I idealize them.

265
00:13:34,397 --> 00:13:36,565
Every woman I meet,
I put up there.

266
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:37,733
Of course,
the longer I know her

267
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:39,234
and the better
I know her...

268
00:13:39,402 --> 00:13:40,944
It's hard to
keep them up there,
isn't it?

269
00:13:41,029 --> 00:13:42,070
Yes, isn't it?

270
00:13:42,238 --> 00:13:44,239
Pretty soon,
the pedestal wobbles

271
00:13:44,532 --> 00:13:46,283
and then topples.

272
00:13:47,076 --> 00:13:49,411
C'est la vie,
et cetera.

273
00:13:50,413 --> 00:13:53,165
Come on.
Let's talk about you.

274
00:13:53,416 --> 00:13:56,084
(CHUCKLES)
No, not tonight.

275
00:13:56,544 --> 00:13:58,420
We'll talk about me
some other time.

276
00:13:59,088 --> 00:14:00,839
We've nothing planned
for tomorrow.

277
00:14:00,924 --> 00:14:02,007
Oh, I have.

278
00:14:02,926 --> 00:14:04,384
Oh, no.

279
00:14:04,636 --> 00:14:06,762
We'll talk about me
tomorrow.

280
00:14:06,846 --> 00:14:08,263
(CHUCKLES)

281
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:19,024
It turned out
beautifully, didn't it?

282
00:14:19,442 --> 00:14:21,485
It's really warm.
Thank you.

283
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:25,072
Now, where were we?

284
00:14:25,156 --> 00:14:27,366
You were going to tell me
where you were born.

285
00:14:27,492 --> 00:14:29,493
That's right.
Well...
Mr. Ferrante?

286
00:14:29,577 --> 00:14:30,619
Cablegram.

287
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:31,745
Thank you.

288
00:14:33,122 --> 00:14:35,290
Excuse me,
Miss McKay.

289
00:14:35,375 --> 00:14:37,251
Miss McKay?
Yes?

290
00:14:37,335 --> 00:14:38,502
Oh, I have one
for you, too.

291
00:14:38,586 --> 00:14:39,586
Oh.

292
00:14:39,671 --> 00:14:41,547
Thank you.
You're welcome.

293
00:14:42,507 --> 00:14:44,424
Excuse me,
Mr. Ferrante.

294
00:14:56,604 --> 00:14:57,604
From him?

295
00:14:57,689 --> 00:14:58,689
From her?

296
00:14:58,815 --> 00:15:00,607
Mmm-hmm.
Mmm-hmm.

297
00:15:05,655 --> 00:15:07,698
Well, where were we?

298
00:15:08,491 --> 00:15:11,577
Well, I was about
to tell you
where I was born

299
00:15:11,661 --> 00:15:14,246
and I was born
in Boston.

300
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:16,206
I can hardly wait
for you to grow up.

301
00:15:16,291 --> 00:15:17,833
Yes. Well, be patient.

302
00:15:18,334 --> 00:15:20,168
I grew up quickly.

303
00:15:20,253 --> 00:15:22,004
(CHUCKLING)
Then I went
to New York

304
00:15:22,088 --> 00:15:23,672
and got a job
singing in a nightclub

305
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:25,507
from 10:00 to 3:00
in the morning

306
00:15:25,592 --> 00:15:26,925
and the manager
used to chase me

307
00:15:27,010 --> 00:15:28,510
around the office
until about 4:00

308
00:15:28,595 --> 00:15:30,387
and then... (WHISTLES)
I went home.

309
00:15:31,097 --> 00:15:32,139
Did he ever...
Oh, no, no.

310
00:15:32,223 --> 00:15:33,473
No, no.
No.

311
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:37,519
Well, then one evening,
he came along.

312
00:15:38,021 --> 00:15:40,022
This is the fellow.
Mmm-hmm.

313
00:15:40,106 --> 00:15:42,190
And he said,

314
00:15:43,026 --> 00:15:45,569
"You don't belong in
a place like this."

315
00:15:45,737 --> 00:15:47,279
Really?
Mmm-hmm.

316
00:15:47,363 --> 00:15:49,865
And I said,
"I don't?"

317
00:15:50,658 --> 00:15:51,908
(LAUGHS)

318
00:15:51,993 --> 00:15:54,453
And well, then...
Mmm?

319
00:15:55,121 --> 00:15:56,872
What?
What "what?"

320
00:15:56,956 --> 00:15:58,332
I don't know,
I thought
you said something.

321
00:15:58,416 --> 00:16:00,125
No, I didn't
say anything.
Oh, I'm sorry.

322
00:16:00,209 --> 00:16:01,918
But you're right,
you know?

323
00:16:03,046 --> 00:16:05,964
He said I belonged
in a penthouse
on Park Avenue

324
00:16:06,049 --> 00:16:09,384
with a breathtaking view
of the East River.

325
00:16:12,221 --> 00:16:14,431
An ideal place for you
to improve yourself.

326
00:16:14,515 --> 00:16:17,225
Yes.
So, I studied hard.

327
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:18,644
Singing? And...

328
00:16:18,728 --> 00:16:20,979
And music and art
and literature.

329
00:16:21,064 --> 00:16:22,147
Mmm.

330
00:16:22,231 --> 00:16:25,484
So that one day you'd make
a perfectly charming wife.

331
00:16:25,568 --> 00:16:27,819
Yes, that was
the general idea.

332
00:16:27,904 --> 00:16:29,196
Anything wrong
with that?

333
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:30,822
No, no, there's
nothing wrong with it.

334
00:16:30,907 --> 00:16:32,407
That's what I thought.

335
00:16:35,787 --> 00:16:38,830
Well, that sort of
brings us up-to-date.

336
00:16:39,248 --> 00:16:41,833
Now my life
is an open book.

337
00:16:42,085 --> 00:16:44,044
That's only one page.

338
00:16:44,128 --> 00:16:46,505
Well, that's
the only page.

339
00:16:47,799 --> 00:16:49,341
(BELL RINGING)

340
00:16:53,054 --> 00:16:55,180
I beg your pardon.

341
00:16:55,264 --> 00:16:57,432
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

342
00:16:57,517 --> 00:16:58,684
No, no. Bad, bad.

343
00:16:58,768 --> 00:16:59,893
Wait a minute.

344
00:16:59,977 --> 00:17:02,187
That's a very
interesting camera.
May I see that?

345
00:17:02,271 --> 00:17:03,271
Oh, yes.

346
00:17:03,523 --> 00:17:05,649
It's new, isn't it?
Thank you.

347
00:17:06,192 --> 00:17:08,276
Oh, please!
Please, stop!

348
00:17:08,361 --> 00:17:10,487
That's unfortunate,
isn't it?

349
00:17:10,863 --> 00:17:12,781
That was not
very nice.

350
00:17:14,742 --> 00:17:15,784
You shouldn't
have done that.

351
00:17:15,868 --> 00:17:17,285

I like you very much.

Oh, thank you.
I'm glad.

Well, if you
will excuse me,
I must sit down.

I think I could
stay here forever.

Oh, no, no, no.
You are too young
for that, my dear.

It is a good place
to sit and remember,

Oh, forgive me. You see,
I had no means
of knowing.

619

would create,

would destroy.

I love Nicolo so much.

636
00:33:48,443 --> 00:33:50,695
When he was
a small boy,

637
00:33:50,779 --> 00:33:53,864
he charmed us all
with his piano playing.

638
00:33:53,949 --> 00:33:56,325
Then he studied painting.

639
00:33:56,785 --> 00:33:59,704
And the worst of it
is he's so good
at everything.

640
00:34:00,455 --> 00:34:02,498
A jack-of-all-talents.

641
00:34:02,624 --> 00:34:05,251
Everything comes
too easily to him.

642
00:34:06,294 --> 00:34:10,214
He's always
attracted by the art
he isn't practicing.

643
00:34:10,590 --> 00:34:14,301
The place he hasn't been,
the girl he hasn't met.

644
00:34:15,387 --> 00:34:17,638
Perhaps I shouldn't
have met him.

645
00:34:19,641 --> 00:34:22,143
No, my dear.
You are different.

646
00:34:23,895 --> 00:34:26,188
I don't mind
confessing to you,

647
00:34:26,732 --> 00:34:28,816
I have been worried
about him.

648
00:34:30,444 --> 00:34:31,819
Sometimes I'm frightened.

649
00:34:31,903 --> 00:34:32,987
Why?

650
00:34:34,072 --> 00:34:37,742
That life will present
a bill to Nicolo one day

651
00:34:38,660 --> 00:34:40,995
and he will find
it hard to pay.

652
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:50,171
But when
I see you with him,
I feel better.

653
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:54,049
Me? You do?

654
00:34:54,134 --> 00:34:55,259
Yes. You.

share your confidence.

couldn't make right.

Well, I saw
Marius' entire family.
Seven daughters.

664
00:35:26,374 --> 00:35:28,793
I congratulated him
and had a nice talk
with his wife.

665
00:35:28,877 --> 00:35:32,505
You should have had
a nice talk with him.
And don't sit on my hat.

666
00:35:35,133 --> 00:35:38,010
Tell me,
what have you two
been talking about?

667
00:35:38,094 --> 00:35:40,179
Hmm.
Oh, you'd be surprised.

668
00:35:40,263 --> 00:35:41,472
I'll bet I would.

669
00:35:41,556 --> 00:35:43,349
And I'll bet
that Janou did
all the talking.

670
00:35:43,433 --> 00:35:44,600
Mmm-hmm.

671
00:35:44,684 --> 00:35:46,977
She's been telling me
that when you were
a little boy

672
00:35:47,062 --> 00:35:48,145
and didn't get
your own way,

673
00:35:48,230 --> 00:35:51,065
you'd lie on the floor
and kick and
get red in the face.

674
00:35:51,191 --> 00:35:52,650
Really?

675
00:35:52,734 --> 00:35:54,235
You should've
winked the other eye.

676
00:35:54,319 --> 00:35:55,402
Oh.

677
00:35:56,154 --> 00:35:57,738
And what did you say?

678
00:35:57,823 --> 00:35:59,698
I said you didn't
do that anymore.

679
00:35:59,991 --> 00:36:01,408
No!
No.

680
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:04,620
Now when you don't
get your own way,

681
00:36:04,704 --> 00:36:06,163
you just
get embarrassed.

Remind me not
to explain that
to you later.

685
00:36:16,675 --> 00:36:18,592
Yes, I want some tea.

686
00:36:18,969 --> 00:36:20,427
Janou, I have
a gift for you.

687
00:36:20,512 --> 00:36:21,637
JANOU: Oh!

688
00:36:21,721 --> 00:36:23,556
Come and see it.

689
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:25,307
I am too old
for gifts.

690
00:36:25,392 --> 00:36:27,268
No one's too old
for gifts.

691
00:36:27,811 --> 00:36:29,687
You shouldn't
spend your money
so recklessly.

692
00:36:29,771 --> 00:36:31,772
It didn't cost much.
Let me help you.

693
00:36:42,534 --> 00:36:45,160
Oh, Nicolo.

694
00:36:48,248 --> 00:36:50,457
How did you do it?

695
00:36:50,542 --> 00:36:51,792
I did it from memory.

696
00:36:52,168 --> 00:36:53,377
Thank you.

697
00:36:56,423 --> 00:36:58,132
It is Andre,

698
00:36:58,508 --> 00:37:00,175
my husband.

699
00:37:01,469 --> 00:37:04,763
It's so real,
so like him.

700
00:37:05,348 --> 00:37:07,683
What a remarkable face.

701
00:37:08,977 --> 00:37:10,728
Did you do that
from memory?

702
00:37:10,812 --> 00:37:11,896
Yes.

703
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:13,522
Do you like it?

704
00:37:14,149 --> 00:37:16,150
Oh, it's wonderful.

705
00:37:16,526 --> 00:37:18,736

01:01:54,336 --> 01:01:55,961
That's fine.
Thank you.

1057
01:01:56,046 --> 01:01:57,088
Did you get
to see Pinky?

1058
01:01:57,172 --> 01:01:58,464
May I have one,
too, please?

1059
01:01:58,548 --> 01:01:59,632
Yes, how's this?

1060
01:01:59,716 --> 01:02:00,758
Thank you.

1061
01:02:00,967 --> 01:02:02,259
No, I think he's on
his way to Tangier.

1062
01:02:02,344 --> 01:02:03,594
May I have
another one, please?

1063
01:02:03,678 --> 01:02:05,513
He's always going
off someplace. Yes.

1064
01:02:05,639 --> 01:02:07,681
That's fine.
Thank you.
Another one, please.

1065
01:02:07,766 --> 01:02:10,017
Excuse me.
I have an important
appointment.

1066
01:02:10,394 --> 01:02:11,936
Excuse me.
Thank you so much.
May I?

1067
01:02:12,562 --> 01:02:13,604
Terry darling.

1068
01:02:13,688 --> 01:02:17,233
Hello, darling.
It's been so long.

1069
01:02:17,317 --> 01:02:19,151
Oh, it's wonderful
to have you back.

1070
01:02:20,070 --> 01:02:22,321
It's wonderful
to be back, Ken.

1071
01:02:22,906 --> 01:02:24,573
Darling,
the car's around here.

1072
01:02:33,834 --> 01:02:35,376
What's the matter?
Shall we get going?

1073
01:02:35,460 --> 01:02:36,585
Yes, let's.
Shall we?

1074
01:02:36,670 --> 01:02:38,671
The car's
right out here.
Good.

1075
01:02:48,890 --> 01:02:50,599
FERRANTE: Darling,
there's something
I must discuss with you.

1076
01:02:50,684 --> 01:02:51,892
It's been on my mind,
so let's go in here

1077
01:02:51,977 --> 01:02:54,186
where we can be
alone and quiet...

1078
01:02:55,564 --> 01:02:56,939
What in the world
is all this?

1079
01:02:57,023 --> 01:02:58,941
Didn't I mention it?
What?

1080
01:02:59,025 --> 01:03:00,484
Dear, the TV people
have been after me

1081
01:03:00,569 --> 01:03:02,278
for an interview,
so I finally said yes

1082
01:03:02,362 --> 01:03:03,446
if they give
a big donation

1083
01:03:03,530 --> 01:03:04,989
to my favorite charity,
and they did.

1084
01:03:05,073 --> 01:03:07,199
You don't mind,
do you, darling?
It's for a good cause.

1085
01:03:07,284 --> 01:03:08,784
I wish you'd
let me know.

1086
01:03:08,869 --> 01:03:10,411
Oh, listen,
I know you.

1087
01:03:10,495 --> 01:03:12,538
If I'd told you,
I'd never have got
you off the ship.

1088
01:03:12,622 --> 01:03:14,165
Camera one,
take close-ups.

1089
01:03:14,249 --> 01:03:16,876
Oh, Nickie, dear,
this is Mr. Lewis who's
going to interview us.

1090
01:03:16,960 --> 01:03:18,252
Mr. Fulton Q. Lewis.

1091
01:03:18,336 --> 01:03:19,336
Robert.

1092
01:03:19,421 --> 01:03:20,838
Robert Fulton,
how do you do?

1093
01:03:20,922 --> 01:03:23,174
No, Robert Q. Lewis,
but everybody does that.

1094
01:03:23,258 --> 01:03:24,633
Please, look,
you're a little late,

1095
01:03:24,718 --> 01:03:25,801
and we've got
to go on the air.

1096
01:03:25,886 --> 01:03:27,470
Would you mind
coming over here,
Miss Clark, please?

1097
01:03:27,554 --> 01:03:29,138
Just sit yourselves
right down here.

1098
01:03:29,222 --> 01:03:32,224
I'm going to ask
a few questions,
then we're going to...

1099
01:03:32,726 --> 01:03:36,061
What about his face?
Shiny. Look, Harry.

1100
01:03:36,146 --> 01:03:38,105
Would you mind
a little makeup?
Harry, just blot it.

1101
01:03:39,232 --> 01:03:40,483
I'm sorry, darling.
It'll be over with soon.

1102
01:03:40,567 --> 01:03:41,567
I hope so.

1103
01:03:41,651 --> 01:03:45,237
Oh, incidentally,
that white shirt,
how about that?

1104
01:03:45,322 --> 01:03:46,489
Glares.

1105
01:03:46,573 --> 01:03:47,990
You don't happen to
have a blue shirt?

1106
01:03:48,074 --> 01:03:49,116
No, not with me.

1107
01:03:49,201 --> 01:03:51,827
Well, yes.
Well, look, don't worry.
We'll manage.

1108
01:03:51,912 --> 01:03:53,329
Let me explain
what I'm going to do.

1109
01:03:53,413 --> 01:03:55,122
I'd like to ask
a few questions
about how you met...

1110
01:03:55,207 --> 01:03:56,707
Just a few.
I will.

1111
01:03:56,791 --> 01:03:59,293
Just how you met,
what your plans are
and things like that.

1112
01:03:59,377 --> 01:04:01,337
You make yourselves
comfortable.
Thank you.

1113
01:04:01,421 --> 01:04:02,505
MAN: Five seconds,
Mr. Lewis.

1114
01:04:02,589 --> 01:04:03,547
Right.

1115
01:04:03,632 --> 01:04:05,758
Now, then, one thing,
watch the camera.

1116
01:04:05,842 --> 01:04:07,885
When the red light
is on, you're on.

1117
01:04:07,969 --> 01:04:09,720
Yeah? Well, it's on.

1118
01:04:11,264 --> 01:04:15,476
Oh, hello there,
and welcome to another
House to House program,

1119
01:04:16,436 --> 01:04:19,522
brought to you
by the Benton
Baby Food Company.

1120
01:04:19,606 --> 01:04:23,275
Remember, Benton's
builds better babies.

1121
01:04:23,985 --> 01:04:27,029
Today, our cameras are
placed in the home
of Miss Lois Clark,

1122
01:04:27,113 --> 01:04:29,865
heiress to one of
America's greatest fortunes.

1123
01:04:30,116 --> 01:04:32,451
In just a moment,
we'll meet Miss Clark

1124
01:04:32,577 --> 01:04:34,870
and her fiancé,
Mr. Nickie Ferrante

1125
01:04:35,288 --> 01:04:38,707
and talk to them about
their wonderful
true-to-life romance

1126
01:04:38,792 --> 01:04:42,253
which has gotten
headlines in papers
all over the country.

1127
01:04:42,337 --> 01:04:46,423
A romance which has
captured the imagination
of the whole world.

1128
01:04:46,883 --> 01:04:47,925
But first...

1129
01:04:48,009 --> 01:04:49,677
Do you think
they're in love?

1130
01:04:50,971 --> 01:04:53,013
I wouldn't know,
Gladys.

1131
01:04:53,098 --> 01:04:55,391
I can't wait to see
that Nickie Ferrante.

1132
01:04:55,475 --> 01:04:57,601
I don't know what
the $64 million
question was,

1133
01:04:57,686 --> 01:04:59,770
but he's certainly
got the answer.

1134
01:05:00,272 --> 01:05:01,313
(DOOR OPENS)

1135
01:05:03,817 --> 01:05:05,401
Point killer.

1136
01:05:07,529 --> 01:05:09,697
Terry, darling.

1137
01:05:10,740 --> 01:05:14,326
WOMAN SINGING ON TV:
So buy Baby Soft

1138
01:05:15,328 --> 01:05:17,121
Buy Baby Soft

1139
01:05:17,205 --> 01:05:18,330
Hmm.

1140
01:05:19,874 --> 01:05:20,916
Remind me to
ask you later

1141
01:05:21,001 --> 01:05:23,377
why your kisses don't
seem quite the same.

1142
01:05:24,170 --> 01:05:26,463
Maybe you're just out
of practice, I hope.

1143
01:05:26,548 --> 01:05:28,424
Yum, yum

1144
01:05:28,508 --> 01:05:30,593
We don't need that
darn thing on, do we?

1145
01:05:30,677 --> 01:05:33,554
Buy Baby Benton's
Better Baby Food

1146
01:05:33,638 --> 01:05:35,055
It's got more zip...

1147
01:05:35,140 --> 01:05:36,682
(TURNS OFF TV)

1148
01:05:37,225 --> 01:05:39,268
I see you haven't
changed yet.

1149
01:05:39,352 --> 01:05:40,519
I thought I gave
you plenty of time

1150
01:05:40,604 --> 01:05:41,604
to get into
something more...

1151
01:05:41,688 --> 01:05:45,190
Well, Ken, we have
so much to talk about

1152
01:05:45,358 --> 01:05:48,527
and I can
just think better
in this outfit.

1153
01:05:49,487 --> 01:05:52,698
You know, darling,
I hoped the trip
would be good for you,

1154
01:05:52,782 --> 01:05:56,035
but I'm afraid you
don't look so well.

1155
01:05:56,703 --> 01:05:59,246
What's the matter?
Was it a rough crossing?

1156
01:06:00,290 --> 01:06:01,498
(STAMMERING)

1157
01:06:01,583 --> 01:06:03,792
Yes, yes.
Yes, it was a little.

1158
01:06:03,877 --> 01:06:05,336
Oh.

1159
01:06:05,420 --> 01:06:08,297
You know, Ken,
that program might
have been amusing.

1160
01:06:08,381 --> 01:06:12,635
Lois Clark and
Nickie Ferrante were
about to come on.

1161
01:06:12,719 --> 01:06:14,053
(CHUCKLES)

1162
01:06:14,137 --> 01:06:16,305
I'm only interested
in you, dear, but if
it'll entertain you...

1163
01:06:16,389 --> 01:06:17,473
Mmm-hmm.
Yes, it will.

1164
01:06:17,557 --> 01:06:18,641
Okay.

1165
01:06:21,895 --> 01:06:23,395
(TURNS ON TV)

1166
01:06:23,521 --> 01:06:24,813
Say, Mr. Ferrante,
you must have had

1167
01:06:24,898 --> 01:06:26,982
some wonderful
experiences in Europe.

1168
01:06:27,067 --> 01:06:28,233
Yes.

1169
01:06:29,110 --> 01:06:31,612
Well, would you care
to expand that statement?

1170
01:06:31,821 --> 01:06:32,821
No.

1171
01:06:32,906 --> 01:06:34,490
(LAUGHS)
Oh.

1172
01:06:34,658 --> 01:06:36,241
There are
so many questions...

1173
01:06:36,368 --> 01:06:40,037
Oh, I forgot Ferrante
was on the same boat
with you, wasn't he?

1174
01:06:40,121 --> 01:06:41,830
Yes, he was.

1175
01:06:41,915 --> 01:06:43,082
Did you meet him?

1176
01:06:44,250 --> 01:06:45,417
Mmm-hmm.

1177
01:06:45,835 --> 01:06:47,711
Was he charming?

1178
01:06:47,921 --> 01:06:48,921
Mmm-hmm.

1179
01:06:49,005 --> 01:06:51,131
LOIS: Well, I'm sure
Nickie has all...

1180
01:06:51,216 --> 01:06:52,466
Fascinating?

1181
01:06:53,009 --> 01:06:54,635
LEWIS: Well, good...
Mmm-hmm.

1182
01:06:54,719 --> 01:06:56,470
LEWIS: Well, you know,
financial difficulties...

1183
01:06:56,554 --> 01:06:57,763
Irresistible?

...often cause
the breakup
of marriages.

1185
01:06:59,933 --> 01:07:01,266
Oh, I'm sorry.

1186
01:07:02,143 --> 01:07:04,311
That wasn't like me.
I withdraw that remark.

1187
01:07:04,437 --> 01:07:06,563
LOIS: That won't be one
of our difficulties.
(LEWIS LAUGHS)

1188
01:07:06,815 --> 01:07:09,024
Well, tell me,
Mr. Ferrante,

1189
01:07:09,109 --> 01:07:11,902
is this
your first experience
with connubial bliss?

1190
01:07:12,821 --> 01:07:14,738
Would you mind
rephrasing the question?

1191
01:07:15,240 --> 01:07:16,865
LOIS: (LAUGHING)
Darling! Darling!

1192
01:07:16,950 --> 01:07:19,118
He means is this
your first experience
with marriage?

1193
01:07:19,244 --> 01:07:21,537
Oh, that's what
he meant. Yes.

1194
01:07:22,914 --> 01:07:26,458
Good. Do you intend
to support your wife
in the

1195
01:07:27,460 --> 01:07:29,420
manner to which...

1196
01:07:29,504 --> 01:07:30,587
Yes.

1197
01:07:31,506 --> 01:07:32,881
(LAUGHING)
That's very funny.

1198
01:07:32,966 --> 01:07:34,383
LOIS: Doing what?

1199
01:07:35,468 --> 01:07:38,053
Well, I'm going to
begin to paint again.

1200
01:07:38,513 --> 01:07:40,764
That's how I intend
to support my wife.

1201
01:07:40,974 --> 01:07:43,058
LEWIS: Oh, well...

1202
01:07:43,560 --> 01:07:46,729
That's certainly going to
take an awful lot of paint.

1203
01:07:46,813 --> 01:07:48,021
(LAUGHS)

1204
01:07:50,233 --> 01:07:53,026
I mean, you already
have a house full
of masterpieces.

1205
01:07:53,111 --> 01:07:56,029
Yes, we have
and I didn't realize
that you were going to...

1206
01:07:56,114 --> 01:07:57,573
I'm still going
to paint.

1207
01:07:57,657 --> 01:07:58,824
Oh, really?

1208
01:07:59,159 --> 01:08:01,493
Well, I mean,
I just thought you'd
given all that up.

1209
01:08:01,578 --> 01:08:03,287
I know,
but I shouldn't have.

1210
01:08:03,788 --> 01:08:06,874
Well, I'm sure Nickie
has all kinds of plans.

1211
01:08:06,958 --> 01:08:08,250
Yes, I have.

1212
01:08:08,334 --> 01:08:11,879
Well, good.
When are you going
to be married?

1213
01:08:11,963 --> 01:08:13,088
We're going
to be married
as soon as we...

1214
01:08:13,173 --> 01:08:15,132
Just a moment, dear.

1215
01:08:15,508 --> 01:08:16,842
In six months.

1216
01:08:18,553 --> 01:08:20,262
Six months.

1217
01:08:20,346 --> 01:08:22,264
I'll bet she never
gets him to the altar.

1218
01:08:26,352 --> 01:08:28,604
Six months.
Well, good.

1219
01:08:28,688 --> 01:08:30,439
Thank you so much,
Miss Clark,

1220
01:08:30,523 --> 01:08:32,191
and you, too,
Mr. Ferrante.

1221
01:08:32,525 --> 01:08:35,194
Well, folks,
that winds up our interview
with this charming couple.

01:08:35,278 --> 01:08:36,695
Terry?

1223
01:08:36,821 --> 01:08:38,113
Mmm-hmm.

(AD PLAYING ON TV)

1225
01:08:39,532 --> 01:08:42,659
I'd like to ask
that question again.

1226
01:08:43,703 --> 01:08:46,538
Did you find
Ferrante irresistible?

1227
01:09:01,054 --> 01:09:03,138
Oh, Ken,
I'm sorry.

(TURNS OFF TV)

You don't
plan these things.
They just happen!

(SOBBING)

1231
01:09:09,270 --> 01:09:12,022
Darling, it just
doesn't make sense.

1232
01:09:12,106 --> 01:09:14,149
I know.
I know it doesn't.

1233
01:09:14,234 --> 01:09:15,901
You've got to
be realistic.

1234
01:09:16,611 --> 01:09:18,320
About love?

1235
01:09:18,404 --> 01:09:20,364
But you know what
everyone says about him.

1236
01:09:20,448 --> 01:09:22,908
Yes, I know,
I know, I know.

1237

What are you
going to do?

1238
01:09:25,411 --> 01:09:28,330
Oh, I don't know, Ken.

1239
01:09:28,414 --> 01:09:30,749
I think I'll...

1240
01:09:30,834 --> 01:09:32,167
I think I'll go back
to Boston

1241
01:09:32,252 --> 01:09:35,003
and try and get a job
or something

Darling, he'll never
be able to support you.

1245
01:09:42,428 --> 01:09:44,930
Oh, Terry, listen to me.
I want to marry you.

1246
01:09:46,099 --> 01:09:48,225
I know I should
have asked you
a long time ago.

1247
01:09:48,309 --> 01:09:50,185
It's my fault,
but it's not too late,
is it?

1248
01:09:50,270 --> 01:09:51,937
It can't be too late.

1249
01:09:52,939 --> 01:09:54,898
Terry, look at me.

1250
01:09:55,483 --> 01:09:57,693
Can't you see
I'm in love?

1251
01:09:59,028 --> 01:10:00,279
Mmm-hmm.

1252
01:10:01,447 --> 01:10:03,031
So am I.

1253
01:10:34,439 --> 01:10:36,523
Well, do you think
you can sell it?

1254
01:10:36,608 --> 01:10:38,525
Of course, I'll try.

1255
01:10:39,152 --> 01:10:40,777
You did this
without a model?

1256
01:10:40,862 --> 01:10:42,487
Yeah,
I couldn't afford one.

1257
01:10:44,324 --> 01:10:46,700
What is it?
Something wrong
with my memory?

1258
01:10:47,327 --> 01:10:49,494
It's getting
a trifle dim.

1259
01:10:49,579 --> 01:10:50,787
No.

1260
01:10:51,456 --> 01:10:52,664
And this?

1261
01:10:52,749 --> 01:10:55,334
I painted that
from memory.
That was my lunch.

1262
01:10:55,418 --> 01:10:56,668
(LAUGHS)

1263
01:10:58,630 --> 01:11:00,130
You know,
it's a woman.

1264
01:11:00,214 --> 01:11:01,340
Yes.

1265
01:11:01,633 --> 01:11:04,384
You mean,
you wouldn't care
to be seen with her?

1266
01:11:04,469 --> 01:11:05,969
I doubt it.

1267
01:11:06,054 --> 01:11:09,056
You know, Nickie,
if you would let me
tell people,

1268
01:11:09,140 --> 01:11:12,225
by people I mean women,
who painted this,

1269
01:11:12,310 --> 01:11:14,186
I could sell it
and plenty more.

1270
01:11:14,270 --> 01:11:16,772
No, no, no.
The old Ferrante is dead.

1271
01:11:16,856 --> 01:11:19,441
But signing "Rossi"
don't mean a thing.

1272
01:11:19,525 --> 01:11:20,776
If you use
your own name...

1273
01:11:20,860 --> 01:11:22,277
The old Ferrante
is dead

1274
01:11:22,362 --> 01:11:24,279
and the new Rossi
is starving.

1275
01:11:25,114 --> 01:11:28,075
What do you expect
in three months?

1276
01:11:28,493 --> 01:11:31,995
Remember, the brush
obeys your hand.

1277
01:11:32,497 --> 01:11:35,707
It doesn't know
you are accustomed to
getting your own way.

1278
01:11:35,875 --> 01:11:39,920
You are spoiled,
but the brush
doesn't know this.

1279
01:11:40,213 --> 01:11:42,547
He cannot humor you.

1280
01:11:42,715 --> 01:11:45,509
I know, I know,
but I was hoping
you'd sell something.

1281
01:11:45,593 --> 01:11:47,719
I want the thrill
of earning
that first dollar.

1282
01:11:48,137 --> 01:11:49,554
Well, I'll have
to get a job.

1283
01:11:49,639 --> 01:11:50,722
What?

1284
01:11:51,391 --> 01:11:52,849
And give up painting?

1285
01:11:52,934 --> 01:11:53,976
No, I'm not going
to give up painting.

1286
01:11:54,060 --> 01:11:55,102
It's the only thing
I know.

1287
01:11:55,186 --> 01:11:56,269
But I've got
to earn money.

1288
01:11:56,354 --> 01:11:57,813
I've got to earn
a lot of it quickly.

1289
01:11:57,897 --> 01:12:00,983
Of course,
in the meantime,
I'll buy you lunch.

1290
01:12:01,067 --> 01:12:02,985
You can repay me
when you're famous.

1291
01:12:03,069 --> 01:12:05,153
That's the first
encouraging thing
you've said.

There you are.

Isn't that extraordinary?

1294
01:12:09,075 --> 01:12:11,326
Wouldn't you think
that's the one thing
I could remember?

1295
01:12:11,411 --> 01:12:12,536
Yeah.
Hmm.

1296
01:12:13,579 --> 01:12:16,248

We have it.

until I get there,
will you?

01:17:31,731 --> 01:17:33,481
That's all we wanted
to know.

1381
01:17:33,607 --> 01:17:36,735

were you?

we'll send it.

I'll have to let
you know where,

I'm not quite sure.

1566
01:31:20,809 --> 01:31:23,894
He's there beside you
all set to guide you

1567
01:31:23,979 --> 01:31:25,896
Rah, rah, rah
sis, boom, bah

1568
01:31:25,981 --> 01:31:27,898
Ricky, ticky, tin
and a ricky ticky tout

1569
01:31:27,983 --> 01:31:29,900
How about a cheer
for the tiny scout

1570
01:31:29,985 --> 01:31:31,527
'Cause he knows you
inside out

1571
01:31:31,611 --> 01:31:33,529
Good side, bad side,
clean side, mean side

1572
01:31:33,613 --> 01:31:36,824
Wrong side, right side,
outside, inside

1573
01:31:36,908 --> 01:31:39,034
He's your friend
without a doubt

1574
01:31:39,119 --> 01:31:40,452
He's your conscience

1575
01:31:40,829 --> 01:31:42,830
He knows you

1576
01:31:42,914 --> 01:31:45,249
Inside

1577
01:31:45,333 --> 01:31:48,460
Out

1578
01:31:49,087 --> 01:31:50,796
(ALL CHEERING)

1579
01:32:09,816 --> 01:32:12,985
Well! (LAUGHS)
Come in!

1580
01:32:15,322 --> 01:32:16,697
Nickie, I'm so happy
to see you.

1581
01:32:16,781 --> 01:32:17,865
My dear friend!

1582
01:32:17,949 --> 01:32:19,617
Come in. Come in.
Come in.

1583
01:32:19,701 --> 01:32:21,368
How's my
severest critic?

1584
01:32:21,453 --> 01:32:23,037
Oh, well, we'll see.

1585
01:32:23,121 --> 01:32:24,496
Oh, I see you've got
them all arranged.

1586
01:32:24,581 --> 01:32:26,373
Come on.
Let me hear the worst.

1587
01:32:26,917 --> 01:32:30,377
Six months' work.
You haven't wasted
your time, Nickie.

1588
01:32:30,462 --> 01:32:32,504
Thank you.
Oh, you should have
seen the 50

1589
01:32:32,589 --> 01:32:33,964
I dropped over
the cliff though.

1590
01:32:34,049 --> 01:32:35,799
Maybe you should have
dropped this one, too.

1591
01:32:35,884 --> 01:32:38,052
Yes, I'm inclined
to agree with you
about that one.

1592
01:32:38,136 --> 01:32:39,678
You know, Nickie,
I can read

1593
01:32:39,763 --> 01:32:41,222
your state of mind
when you painted this.

1594
01:32:41,306 --> 01:32:42,765
Yeah?

1595
01:32:42,849 --> 01:32:45,893
You were very sorry
for yourself when
you painted this one.

1596
01:32:45,977 --> 01:32:47,436
That one was painted
in August.
Doesn't count.

1597
01:32:47,520 --> 01:32:48,854
Mmm.

1598
01:32:49,648 --> 01:32:53,108
You were angry here.
You were getting
over your broken heart.

1599
01:32:53,193 --> 01:32:55,778
Broken heart?
Oh, that stuff's
not for me.

1600
01:32:55,862 --> 01:32:57,029
I'm glad to hear that.

1601
01:32:57,113 --> 01:32:58,572
Come on. Let's get
down to this end.
Come on.

1602
01:32:58,657 --> 01:33:01,367
I'm coming to that.
I'm coming to that.

1603
01:33:03,662 --> 01:33:08,249
Yeah, here, Nickie,
you became a painter.

1604
01:33:08,500 --> 01:33:12,127
Thank you.
I'm not exactly ashamed
of that one myself.

1605
01:33:12,212 --> 01:33:15,339
I had a great deal to say
and I painted it instead.

1606
01:33:15,507 --> 01:33:18,008
Your being away,
alone, for a long time,

1607
01:33:18,093 --> 01:33:20,010
has given you
that grasp of...

1608
01:33:20,095 --> 01:33:21,262
(PHONE RINGING)

1609
01:33:21,346 --> 01:33:22,805
I'll get it.
Remember where you were.

1610
01:33:22,889 --> 01:33:24,598
I want to hear
more of that.

1611
01:33:24,683 --> 01:33:27,518
Hello? Courbet's Paint
and Varnish Store.

1612
01:33:28,645 --> 01:33:31,897
Nickie?
I read you arrived today.

1613
01:33:32,190 --> 01:33:35,776
Lois, how nice.
How did you know
I was here?

1614
01:33:36,194 --> 01:33:37,569
I called your hotel,
and they said

1615
01:33:37,654 --> 01:33:39,280
you could be reached
at this number.

1616
01:33:39,364 --> 01:33:42,950
Oh, Nickie, I've been
thinking about you
morning, noon and night

1617
01:33:43,034 --> 01:33:44,868
and in-between times, too.

1618
01:33:45,829 --> 01:33:47,871
I was wondering if
maybe you could...

1619
01:33:48,206 --> 01:33:49,373
A-ha.

1620
01:33:49,749 --> 01:33:53,419
Well, no, no,
I like the idea
all right.

1621
01:33:53,503 --> 01:33:56,505
That's a nice offer,
but I don't think I can
make it this afternoon.

1622
01:33:56,631 --> 01:34:00,676
Well, if you
can't do that...
Oh, I wish you would.

1623
01:34:01,219 --> 01:34:02,720
Mmm-mmm.

1624
01:34:03,888 --> 01:34:06,724
Thanks anyway.
Nicest thing that's
happened today.

1625
01:34:07,058 --> 01:34:08,267
Oh.

1626
01:34:08,351 --> 01:34:10,894
But you could make
the show tonight.

1627
01:34:11,604 --> 01:34:13,731
Well, I'll leave a ticket
at the box office anyway.

1628
01:34:13,815 --> 01:34:16,483
Do try to make it.
And, Nickie...

1629
01:34:17,402 --> 01:34:21,322
Whatever you do,
don't plan anything
for after the show, huh?

1630
01:34:21,406 --> 01:34:23,615
(ORCHESTRAL MUSIC PLAYING)

1631
01:34:50,393 --> 01:34:51,685
I love our seats.

1632
01:34:51,770 --> 01:34:52,978
What?

1633
01:34:53,521 --> 01:34:55,689
I said
I love our seats.

1634

(MUSIC STOPS)

1635
01:35:21,674 --> 01:35:23,509
We enjoyed it
very much.

1636
01:35:23,593 --> 01:35:24,676
Thank you
for asking us.

1637
01:35:24,761 --> 01:35:26,929
Oh, it was a pleasure.
If you don't mind,

1638
01:35:27,013 --> 01:35:28,472
Mr. Ferrante will
see me home.

1639
01:35:28,556 --> 01:35:30,057
Very well.
Good night.
Good night.

1640
01:35:30,141 --> 01:35:31,850
Good night.

1641
01:35:34,813 --> 01:35:36,605
Now, where would
you like to go?

1642
01:35:36,689 --> 01:35:38,315
Suppose you decide,
Nickie.

1643
01:35:38,400 --> 01:35:39,566
After all,
this is your evening.

1644
01:35:39,651 --> 01:35:42,778
I've been away so long
I have no idea where
people go nowadays.

1645
01:35:42,987 --> 01:35:44,154
My coat.

1646
01:35:56,835 --> 01:35:57,918
Hello.

1647
01:35:59,003 --> 01:36:00,254
Hello.

1648
01:36:16,646 --> 01:36:17,813
(CHUCKLES)

1649
01:36:18,398 --> 01:36:20,691
Terry, please
let me tell him.

1650
01:36:21,151 --> 01:36:22,943
Oh, no. No.

1651
01:36:23,319 --> 01:36:24,319
I'll go get him.

1652
01:36:24,404 --> 01:36:26,655
No, please.
Please, Ken.

1653
01:36:28,074 --> 01:36:29,366
(SIGHS)

1654
01:36:29,742 --> 01:36:31,243
It's pretty rough.

1655
01:36:32,203 --> 01:36:34,204
The first time you're
able to get out

1656
01:36:34,289 --> 01:36:36,206
and you have
to run into him.

1657
01:36:37,041 --> 01:36:40,627
And all I could say
was "Hello."

1658
01:36:41,754 --> 01:36:43,046
(LAUGHS)

1659
01:36:45,091 --> 01:36:47,384
Well, the show's over.

1660
01:36:48,052 --> 01:36:50,387
Boy got the girl.
Shall we go?

1661
01:36:55,143 --> 01:36:56,685
I'll only be a minute.

1662
01:36:57,353 --> 01:36:58,687
Yes.

1663
01:37:19,918 --> 01:37:21,919
Good night, Lois,
and thank you.

1664
01:37:22,003 --> 01:37:23,253
Taking you to
a show tonight

1665
01:37:23,338 --> 01:37:25,547
wasn't a very
good idea, was it?

1666
01:37:26,299 --> 01:37:27,799
Merry Christmas, Lois.

1667
01:37:27,884 --> 01:37:32,137
Merry Christmas, Nickie,
and auf Wiedersehen.

1668
01:38:04,254 --> 01:38:07,172
Oh, I think it's terrible
to have to take you home

1669
01:38:07,257 --> 01:38:09,466
just when
everyone else
is going out.

1670
01:38:12,637 --> 01:38:15,389
C'est la vie,
et cetera.

1671
01:38:16,975 --> 01:38:19,810
Terry, let me
ask you again.

1672
01:38:19,894 --> 01:38:22,020
Why won't you
let me help you?

1673
01:38:22,105 --> 01:38:25,399
All right then,
I will tell you again.

1674
01:38:25,483 --> 01:38:27,901
Now, if you paid
for my getting well,
he wouldn't like it

1675
01:38:27,986 --> 01:38:29,611
and if he didn't like it,
I wouldn't like it.

1676
01:38:29,696 --> 01:38:30,862
Then if you did
get me well,

1677
01:38:30,947 --> 01:38:32,781
and I went to him,
you wouldn't like it.

1678
01:38:32,865 --> 01:38:34,700
But certainly
he ought to know.

1679
01:38:34,784 --> 01:38:36,702
No, because
if he found out,

1680
01:38:36,786 --> 01:38:38,870
he'd insist upon
doing it himself

1681
01:38:38,997 --> 01:38:40,622
if he had the money,
which I doubt.

1682
01:38:40,707 --> 01:38:44,042
And then if I
didn't get well...
Ooh! That'd be awful.

1683
01:38:44,502 --> 01:38:47,087
No, unless I can
walk to him,

1684
01:38:47,171 --> 01:38:50,257
and when I say walk,
I mean run,
he'll never know.

1685
01:38:50,341 --> 01:38:54,052
Well, I'm fine.
I've got my job,
and I'm on a budget.

1686
01:38:54,137 --> 01:38:58,265
If things come out right,
and then maybe if
I'm a very good girl,

1687
01:38:58,349 --> 01:39:00,642
I'll get what I want
next Christmas.

1688
01:39:00,727 --> 01:39:02,227
Follow?

1689
01:39:26,044 --> 01:39:27,419
Merry Christmas.

1690
01:39:27,503 --> 01:39:28,795
CHILDREN: Merry Christmas.

1691
01:39:28,880 --> 01:39:31,048
How are you feeling,
Miss McKay?

1692
01:39:31,424 --> 01:39:34,217
Children, I have
bad news for you.

1693
01:39:35,094 --> 01:39:36,887
Doctor won't let me
go with you.

1694
01:39:36,971 --> 01:39:38,680
ALL: Oh!

1695
01:39:39,223 --> 01:39:41,433
Doctor, I could be back
in a couple of hours.

1696
01:39:42,060 --> 01:39:44,436
This is the Christmas
benefit.

1697
01:39:44,520 --> 01:39:47,814
This is their first
public appearance.
This is my team.

1698
01:39:48,066 --> 01:39:49,566
She's our coach, Doc.

1699
01:39:49,651 --> 01:39:51,818
Norman, Doctor.

1700
01:39:52,904 --> 01:39:54,946
She's our coach,
Doctor.

1701
01:39:55,031 --> 01:39:56,114
(CHUCKLES)

1702
01:39:56,199 --> 01:39:58,575
If it wasn't good for her,
you wouldn't want
her to go, would you?

1703
01:39:59,077 --> 01:40:00,535
CHILDREN: No!

1704
01:40:01,746 --> 01:40:04,206
Well, look,
why don't you try it
without me, hmm?

1705
01:40:04,916 --> 01:40:06,333
Mmm. Come on.

1706
01:40:06,417 --> 01:40:08,335
The only thing
that would bother you
would be the start.

1707
01:40:08,586 --> 01:40:10,003
Miss McKay?

1708
01:40:10,088 --> 01:40:11,546
Yes, Tyrone?

1709
01:40:11,964 --> 01:40:13,965
We'll be
thinking about you
while we're singing,

1710
01:40:14,050 --> 01:40:16,009
hoping that you'll be
around okay real soon.

1711
01:40:16,386 --> 01:40:19,137
Oh, thank you, Tyrone.

1712
01:40:20,598 --> 01:40:23,350
Wait a minute.
Where's Sally?

1713
01:40:23,434 --> 01:40:24,893
Isn't she with us today?

1714
01:40:24,977 --> 01:40:27,521
We took her off the team.
She sings too loud.

1715
01:40:27,605 --> 01:40:29,398
She's a show-off.

1716
01:40:29,482 --> 01:40:30,565
McGRATH: Sally thought
it was a joke,

1717
01:40:30,650 --> 01:40:32,984
and she wanted so badly
to go on the stage.

1718
01:40:33,111 --> 01:40:34,236
Oh.

1719
01:40:35,655 --> 01:40:37,614
You come here,
darling.

1720
01:40:38,157 --> 01:40:40,409
Now, you go
right up on the stage
with the rest of them.

1721
01:40:40,493 --> 01:40:42,202
I'll put you back
on the team,

1722
01:40:42,370 --> 01:40:45,038
but you must promise
not to drown out
the other children.

1723
01:40:45,289 --> 01:40:46,873
All right, Miss McKay.

1724
01:40:47,417 --> 01:40:49,292
Now, are we ready?
CHILDREN: Yes.

1725
01:40:49,377 --> 01:40:51,128
All right.

1726
01:40:54,298 --> 01:40:57,467
ALL: (SINGING)
There's a wonderful place

1727
01:40:57,552 --> 01:41:00,971
Called Tomorrow Land

1728
01:41:01,055 --> 01:41:02,723
Tomorrow Land

1729
01:41:02,890 --> 01:41:08,478
And it's only a dream away

1730
01:41:08,771 --> 01:41:10,939
Away

1731
01:41:11,065 --> 01:41:14,234
And the moment you get

1732
01:41:14,318 --> 01:41:17,279
To Tomorrow Land

1733
01:41:17,822 --> 01:41:19,406
Tomorrow Land

01:41:19,532 --> 01:41:23,785
You'll forget all about

1735
01:41:23,870 --> 01:41:25,829
Today

1736
01:41:25,913 --> 01:41:27,664
Today

1737
01:41:27,749 --> 01:41:31,918
You'll be walking
on clouds
(HUMMING)

1738
01:41:32,003 --> 01:41:35,964
You'll forget every care

1739
01:41:36,048 --> 01:41:40,594
And your troubles like bubbles

1740
01:41:40,678 --> 01:41:45,098
Will vanish in air

1741
01:41:46,851 --> 01:41:50,270
Ask me how do you get

1742
01:41:50,354 --> 01:41:53,398
To Tomorrow Land

1743
01:41:53,733 --> 01:41:55,400
Tomorrow Land

1744
01:41:55,777 --> 01:41:59,780
Close your eyes, make a wish

1745
01:42:00,364 --> 01:42:04,367
And you're there

1746
01:42:04,869 --> 01:42:07,370
Close your eyes

1747
01:42:07,538 --> 01:42:09,873
Make a wish

1748
01:42:10,124 --> 01:42:12,918
And you're

1749
01:42:13,002 --> 01:42:15,545
There

1750
01:42:21,219 --> 01:42:23,303
You're going to do
all right without me.

1751
01:42:23,387 --> 01:42:26,139
All right, children.
We must go now.
Good-bye, Terry.

1752
01:42:26,224 --> 01:42:28,767
Good-bye, Father.
Good-bye, darling.
Run along.

1753
01:42:28,893 --> 01:42:31,394
Merry Christmas!
Bless you.
(CHILDREN CLAMORING)

1754
01:42:31,479 --> 01:42:33,438
Be good now.

1755
01:42:34,315 --> 01:42:35,899
(LAUGHING)

1756
01:42:36,901 --> 01:42:37,984
Oh.

1757
01:42:38,778 --> 01:42:40,779
Merry Christmas!

1758
01:42:40,905 --> 01:42:43,907
Oh! Merry Christmas,
darling!

1759
01:42:44,450 --> 01:42:46,201
Merry Christmas!

1760
01:42:46,828 --> 01:42:49,579
This isn't going to
be much of a Christmas
for you, is it?

1761
01:42:49,664 --> 01:42:51,498
Oh, I'll be all right.

1762
01:42:51,582 --> 01:42:52,833
There we are.

1763
01:42:52,917 --> 01:42:54,709
Could you just
hand me my...
Yes, surely.

1764
01:42:54,794 --> 01:42:56,336
Thank you so much.

1765
01:42:56,420 --> 01:42:57,587
You're...

1766
01:42:57,839 --> 01:43:01,383
You're welcome
to have turkey with
my husband and me.

1767
01:43:01,467 --> 01:43:04,010
Oh, you save
a drumstick for me
for later, will you?

1768
01:43:04,095 --> 01:43:05,846
All right, I will.
(CHUCKLES)

1769
01:43:05,930 --> 01:43:08,765
And if there's
anything else you want,
just holler.

1770
01:43:08,850 --> 01:43:10,767
Thank you so much.
I will.

1771
01:43:10,852 --> 01:43:13,270
It was very sweet of you.
Merry Christmas.

1772
01:43:13,521 --> 01:43:15,981
And a merry Christmas
to you, too.

1773
01:43:16,774 --> 01:43:18,400
Does Miss McKay...

1774
01:43:26,576 --> 01:43:27,826
Nickie?

1775
01:43:30,246 --> 01:43:31,663
Hello, Terry.

1776
01:43:34,750 --> 01:43:37,878
(STAMMERING) Oh,
it's good to see you.

1777
01:43:38,296 --> 01:43:40,046
Oh, it's good
to see you, too.

1778
01:43:41,340 --> 01:43:42,507
You feeling all right?

1779
01:43:42,592 --> 01:43:44,467
(STAMMERING) Yes.
Yes. I'm fine.

1780
01:43:44,552 --> 01:43:46,094
I'm just resting.

1781
01:43:46,178 --> 01:43:48,013
Good, good. Good.

1782
01:43:48,890 --> 01:43:51,099
Well, it's been
a long time.

1783
01:43:51,183 --> 01:43:52,434
Yes, hasn't it?

1784
01:43:54,520 --> 01:43:57,230
Well, it is good
to see you.

1785
01:43:57,315 --> 01:43:58,481
You said that.

1786
01:43:59,358 --> 01:44:00,567
May I...

1787
01:44:00,651 --> 01:44:02,485
Oh, yes, please, do.
Sit down.

1788
01:44:04,989 --> 01:44:07,073
I'll only be a minute.
I'm sure you don't mind.

1789
01:44:07,158 --> 01:44:09,618
No, no, of course not.

1790
01:44:11,746 --> 01:44:14,748
Oh, is this
the breathtaking view?

1791
01:44:15,499 --> 01:44:18,501
Well, the altitude
bothered me.

1792
01:44:18,586 --> 01:44:20,003
Yeah, yeah.

1793
01:44:26,552 --> 01:44:29,721
Well, I'll bet
you're wondering
how I got here.

1794
01:44:30,389 --> 01:44:33,099
Well, yes.
Yes, yes, I am.

1795
01:44:34,101 --> 01:44:37,938
Well, I was looking
through a telephone book
for a man named McBride.

1796
01:44:38,022 --> 01:44:41,483
And I came across
the name T. McKay.

1797
01:44:42,610 --> 01:44:44,110
And I said to myself,

1798
01:44:44,195 --> 01:44:47,364
"Now, could that
possibly be Terry McKay,
my old friend?"

1799
01:44:48,574 --> 01:44:49,908
And it was.

1800
01:44:49,992 --> 01:44:51,284
Yes, yes.

1801
01:44:52,244 --> 01:44:53,620
And then I said
to myself,

1802
01:44:53,704 --> 01:44:57,457
"Well, now, I haven't been
very nice to Miss McKay.

1803
01:44:57,541 --> 01:44:58,959
"After all,
I had an appointment

1804
01:44:59,043 --> 01:45:02,379
"with her one day,
and I didn't keep it."

1805
01:45:05,549 --> 01:45:06,967
You didn't keep...

1806
01:45:07,510 --> 01:45:08,760
No.

1807
01:45:08,886 --> 01:45:10,011
(LAUGHS)

1808
01:45:10,638 --> 01:45:14,557
Well, so I said
to myself,

1809
01:45:14,892 --> 01:45:17,018
I talk to myself
quite a lot these days,

1810
01:45:17,103 --> 01:45:19,229
I said, "Well, that's
not a very nice way

1811
01:45:19,313 --> 01:45:20,939
"to treat an old friend
like Miss McKay.

1812
01:45:21,023 --> 01:45:23,108
"I must apologize
to Miss McKay."

1813
01:45:23,609 --> 01:45:25,986
Don't you agree
when someone doesn't
keep an appointment

1814
01:45:26,070 --> 01:45:27,612
they should apologize,
hmm?

1815
01:45:28,364 --> 01:45:31,449
Yes. Oh, yes, I think
you're absolutely right.

1816
01:45:31,534 --> 01:45:34,995
I... Well, I think
the least people could do

1817
01:45:35,079 --> 01:45:39,416
is to say they're
sorry or something.

1818
01:45:40,960 --> 01:45:42,419
So here I am.

1819
01:45:43,838 --> 01:45:45,839
That's very sweet.

1820
01:45:46,382 --> 01:45:47,924
I thought so.

1821
01:45:49,844 --> 01:45:51,678
I've often wondered
about you.

1822
01:45:51,762 --> 01:45:52,846
(LAUGHS)

1823
01:45:52,930 --> 01:45:54,097
And how you were.

1824
01:45:54,181 --> 01:45:55,265
Did you really?

1825
01:45:56,851 --> 01:45:58,643
Yes, really.

1826
01:46:00,229 --> 01:46:02,939
Well, I've often
thought about you, too.

1827
01:46:04,025 --> 01:46:07,110
Then you weren't angry
because I wasn't there?

1828
01:46:07,445 --> 01:46:08,611
I mean, you must
have been at first.

1829
01:46:10,906 --> 01:46:13,450
Well, yes.

1830
01:46:13,534 --> 01:46:15,160
Yes, yes, I was.

1831
01:46:15,786 --> 01:46:18,079
At first,
I was furious.

1832
01:46:18,622 --> 01:46:21,750
I said,
"He can't do this to me.
Who does he think he is?"

1833
01:46:22,209 --> 01:46:24,502
Hmm. How long
did you wait?

1834
01:46:24,587 --> 01:46:26,337
I mean,
did you wait long?

1835
01:46:26,964 --> 01:46:28,923
Well, let's...

1836
01:46:29,008 --> 01:46:32,218
Well, yes. Yes,
I waited until about...

1837
01:46:32,303 --> 01:46:33,511
Midnight.

1838
01:46:35,306 --> 01:46:36,473
Oh.

1839
01:46:37,475 --> 01:46:38,975
And then what
did you do?

1840
01:46:40,311 --> 01:46:43,313
Well, then I got
really mad. Mmm.

1841
01:46:43,773 --> 01:46:46,483
Well, you can imagine,
standing up there
on the...

1842
01:46:46,859 --> 01:46:48,568
Yes, in a thunderstorm.

1843
01:46:50,237 --> 01:46:51,905
In a thunderstorm.

1844
01:46:54,533 --> 01:46:56,493
Then what did you
say to yourself?

1845
01:46:57,536 --> 01:47:01,289
Well, then I said,
"Go on home
and get tight."

1846
01:47:01,373 --> 01:47:02,540
But you didn't
do that.

1847
01:47:02,625 --> 01:47:03,708
Didn't I?

1848
01:47:03,834 --> 01:47:06,336
No. Well...

1849
01:47:06,879 --> 01:47:08,755
Maybe just
a little one

1850
01:47:09,215 --> 01:47:11,466
every hour
for about a month.

1851
01:47:12,134 --> 01:47:13,426
Can you blame me?

1852
01:47:13,511 --> 01:47:15,053
Oh, I should say not.

1853
01:47:15,763 --> 01:47:18,598
The least I could have done
was to have sent you a note.

1854
01:47:19,058 --> 01:47:21,184
Well, perhaps
by the time
you thought of it,

1855
01:47:21,268 --> 01:47:23,311
you didn't know
where to reach me.

1856
01:47:23,395 --> 01:47:26,689
But you swore if you ever
saw me again you'd ask.

1857
01:47:26,857 --> 01:47:29,192
No. No.

1858
01:47:29,610 --> 01:47:33,613
I remember we said
that if we could make it,
we'd be there.

1859
01:47:34,490 --> 01:47:36,741
And if one of us
didn't show up,

1860
01:47:37,535 --> 01:47:39,786
it would be for
a darn good reason.

1861
01:47:40,538 --> 01:47:41,871
Did we say that?

1862
01:47:42,081 --> 01:47:44,249
Yes, that is exactly
what we said.

1863
01:47:44,375 --> 01:47:46,042
Well, like what
for instance?

1864
01:47:46,210 --> 01:47:50,088
So, there'll be no more
questions asked, I hope?

1865
01:47:52,133 --> 01:47:53,341
(CHUCKLES)

1866
01:47:54,468 --> 01:47:55,593
Would you like
a cigarette?

1867
01:47:55,678 --> 01:47:57,554
(SIGHS) Thank you.

1868
01:47:58,931 --> 01:48:00,598
Thank you, Nickie.

1869
01:48:04,770 --> 01:48:06,813
Isn't that wonderful?

1870
01:48:06,897 --> 01:48:09,899
I walked all
the way here just to...

1871
01:48:10,234 --> 01:48:13,444
And now I'm not even
supposed to ask you
why you weren't there.

1872
01:48:16,240 --> 01:48:17,782
Isn't it strange?

1873
01:48:18,409 --> 01:48:20,618
We used to read
each other's thoughts.

1874
01:48:21,620 --> 01:48:23,538
It's not the same,
is it?

1875
01:48:24,498 --> 01:48:26,207
Not quite.
Hmm.

1876
01:48:27,293 --> 01:48:29,252
It doesn't seem...
I know.

1877
01:48:31,839 --> 01:48:34,591
I don't know
what happens to me.
Whenever I...

1878
01:48:36,719 --> 01:48:38,887
No wedding ring, I see.

1879
01:48:40,014 --> 01:48:41,681
No.

1880
01:48:41,765 --> 01:48:43,016
Well, I thought
at the...

1881
01:48:43,100 --> 01:48:45,059
Last night, the show?

1882
01:48:45,603 --> 01:48:47,979
No, no.
He was just...

1883
01:48:49,106 --> 01:48:50,106
No.

1884
01:48:52,943 --> 01:48:54,944
I didn't mean
to offend you.

1885
01:48:56,405 --> 01:48:59,073
How's everything
with you, Nickie?

1886
01:48:59,450 --> 01:49:01,576
Oh, you can
ask questions?

1887
01:49:01,660 --> 01:49:02,827
Mmm-hmm.

1888
01:49:02,912 --> 01:49:04,287
(CHUCKLES)

1889
01:49:04,663 --> 01:49:06,372
Well, I thought
everything was fine

1890
01:49:06,457 --> 01:49:07,916
until I saw you
last night.

1891
01:49:08,417 --> 01:49:11,169
Then I knew there must
be something between us,

1892
01:49:11,462 --> 01:49:13,463
even if it's
only an ocean,

1893
01:49:13,547 --> 01:49:15,131
so I bought myself
a ticket.

1894
01:49:17,426 --> 01:49:20,136
Oh, you're sailing?

1895
01:49:20,888 --> 01:49:22,138
Tonight.

1896
01:49:24,975 --> 01:49:26,267
And you're happy,
aren't you?

1897
01:49:26,352 --> 01:49:28,102
Yes, yes.

1898
01:49:29,230 --> 01:49:30,230
And you?

1899
01:49:30,314 --> 01:49:31,439
I don't know.

1900
01:49:31,523 --> 01:49:32,732
I'm worried
about the future.

1901
01:49:32,816 --> 01:49:33,942
I don't know what
people will think.

1902
01:49:34,026 --> 01:49:37,403
They'll say,
"There he goes,
the mad painter.

1903
01:49:37,488 --> 01:49:39,989
"There's something
the matter with him.
He doesn't like women."

1904
01:49:40,115 --> 01:49:42,200
Why would people
say that?
Why?

1905
01:49:42,326 --> 01:49:43,910
Because he sails
the seven seas

1906
01:49:43,994 --> 01:49:46,204
and to every woman
he meets he says,

1907
01:49:46,372 --> 01:49:48,873
"Where will you be
in six months?"

1908
01:49:49,541 --> 01:49:51,542
And they're there?
Everywhere.

1909
01:49:51,669 --> 01:49:54,587
Tops of pyramids,
the domes of cathedrals,
the Eiffel Tower.

1910
01:49:54,672 --> 01:49:56,673
He still tries to
keep them up high.

1911
01:49:56,966 --> 01:49:57,966
He keeps them waiting.

1912
01:49:58,050 --> 01:50:00,009
Sure. Waiting,
waiting, waiting.

1913
01:50:00,094 --> 01:50:01,886
And where is he
all this time?

1914
01:50:05,140 --> 01:50:06,474
Waiting.

1915
01:50:07,810 --> 01:50:10,019
But you can't go on
like that.

1916
01:50:10,729 --> 01:50:12,939
It isn't right for you.

1917
01:50:13,023 --> 01:50:15,108
I wish I could say
you were wrong.

1918
01:50:15,734 --> 01:50:17,318
I was once.

1919
01:50:20,030 --> 01:50:21,739
How'd you like to
change the subject?

1920
01:50:21,824 --> 01:50:24,993
Yes, yes, I'd love to.
Merry Christmas.

1921
01:50:25,369 --> 01:50:28,079
Oh, I almost forgot.

1922
01:50:29,415 --> 01:50:31,291
Now, six months ago,
who'd have thought

1923
01:50:31,375 --> 01:50:32,792
we'd be spending
Christmas together

1924
01:50:32,876 --> 01:50:34,419
in front of
a nice warm fire?

1925
01:50:34,670 --> 01:50:36,212
I brought you a present.

1926
01:50:38,424 --> 01:50:43,970
Oh, thank you. I'm sorry.
I don't have one for you.

1927
01:50:44,054 --> 01:50:47,223
I didn't think
I'd be seeing you.

1928
01:50:47,308 --> 01:50:49,100
That's all right.
I didn't expect one.

1929
01:50:49,184 --> 01:50:50,893
That isn't really
a Christmas present.

1930
01:51:02,239 --> 01:51:04,574
Oh, that's why
my letters came back.

1931
01:51:12,791 --> 01:51:13,833
I would have
sent it to you,

1932
01:51:13,917 --> 01:51:16,169
but I didn't know
your address until today.

1933
01:51:19,882 --> 01:51:21,674
She wanted you to
have it, remember?

1934
01:51:25,179 --> 01:51:28,473
So, well,
that's the reason I...

1935
01:51:40,652 --> 01:51:42,445
Good-bye, Terry.

1936
01:51:44,281 --> 01:51:45,948
Good-bye, Nickie.

1937
01:51:57,044 --> 01:51:58,628
(CLEARS THROAT)

1938
01:52:07,471 --> 01:52:10,223
You know, I painted you
like that with the shawl.

1939
01:52:10,474 --> 01:52:11,933
I wish you could
have seen it.

1940
01:52:12,017 --> 01:52:14,060
Courbet said it was
one of my best.

1941
01:52:15,604 --> 01:52:17,355
I didn't think I could
ever part with it.

1942
01:52:17,481 --> 01:52:21,025
But, well,
there was no reason to
keep it any longer, and...

1943
01:52:21,819 --> 01:52:24,695
I couldn't take money for it,
because, well, you know...

1944
01:52:25,948 --> 01:52:28,533
So, Courbet told me
a young woman

1945
01:52:28,617 --> 01:52:31,619
came into the gallery,
and she liked it.

1946
01:52:31,912 --> 01:52:33,746
She saw in it what
I'd hoped you'd see,

1947
01:52:33,831 --> 01:52:36,874
so I told Courbet
to give it to her

1948
01:52:37,876 --> 01:52:40,253
because he said
she didn't have
any money,

1949
01:52:40,337 --> 01:52:42,463
and not only that,
she was...

1950
01:52:45,509 --> 01:52:46,968
She was...

1951
01:52:49,304 --> 01:52:51,681
Anyway, I told him
to give it to her.

1952
01:52:52,349 --> 01:52:54,058
Courbet said
she wanted it
so badly

1953
01:52:54,143 --> 01:52:55,893
and so I told him
to give it to her.

1954
01:52:55,978 --> 01:52:58,771
You know,
it's the Christmas season
and all that.

1955
01:52:58,856 --> 01:53:01,190
And you know me.
Holly in my heart.

1956
01:53:34,725 --> 01:53:36,642
Darling, don't look
at me like that.

1957
01:53:41,607 --> 01:53:43,232
Why didn't you tell me?

1958
01:53:43,650 --> 01:53:45,818
If it had to
happen to one of us,

1959
01:53:45,903 --> 01:53:47,695
why did it have
to be you?

1960
01:53:49,698 --> 01:53:50,907
Oh.

1961
01:53:52,743 --> 01:53:55,745
It was nobody's fault,
but my own.

1962
01:53:56,413 --> 01:53:57,455
(SNIFFLING)

1963
01:53:57,539 --> 01:53:59,582
I was looking up.

1964
01:54:00,584 --> 01:54:03,002
It was the nearest thing
to heaven.

1965
01:54:04,880 --> 01:54:06,756
You were there.

1966
01:54:07,883 --> 01:54:10,843
Oh, darling, don't...

1967
01:54:10,928 --> 01:54:13,012
Don't worry, darling.

1968
01:54:13,096 --> 01:54:16,057
If you can paint,
I can walk.

1969
01:54:16,600 --> 01:54:19,519
Anything can happen.
Don't you think?

1970
01:54:19,603 --> 01:54:22,939
Yes, darling, yes.
Yes, yes, yes.

1971
01:54:29,780 --> 01:54:33,074
CHORUS: (SINGING)
Our love affair

1972
01:54:33,158 --> 01:54:37,453
To remember
