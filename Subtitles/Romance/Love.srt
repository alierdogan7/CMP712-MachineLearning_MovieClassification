1
00:00:10,411 --> 00:00:15,216
(Relaxing music)

2
00:02:29,417 --> 00:02:34,154
(Soft moaning)

3
00:02:53,307 --> 00:02:58,246
(Alarm ringing)

4
00:03:14,828 --> 00:03:16,364
[Voiceover] Nora?

5
00:03:21,569 --> 00:03:22,703
[Gaspar] Papa?

6
00:03:23,804 --> 00:03:25,306
[Voiceover] What time is it?

7
00:03:27,941 --> 00:03:30,511
Oh what did I do last night?

8
00:03:31,379 --> 00:03:33,247
Why did I take that shit?

9
00:03:34,582 --> 00:03:38,819
(Gaspar crying)

10
00:03:40,454 --> 00:03:42,256
Why is he moaning?

11
00:03:45,826 --> 00:03:47,661
Today is shit.

12
00:03:54,935 --> 00:03:57,438
Is the whole year gonna be like
this?

13
00:03:59,373 --> 00:04:02,242
(Yawning)

14
00:04:03,911 --> 00:04:05,779
I think I'm still high.

15
00:04:09,049 --> 00:04:11,018
[Murphy] Happy New Year.

16
00:04:13,053 --> 00:04:15,623
Happy New Year.

17
00:04:16,524 --> 00:04:17,425
[Omi] Murphy?

18
00:04:17,458 --> 00:04:18,926
[Gaspar] Happy New Year.

19
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:21,362
[Murphy] Happy New Year.

20
00:04:21,829 --> 00:04:23,631
[Voiceover] I should've
brushed my teeth.

21
00:04:24,765 --> 00:04:26,534
I smell like shit.

22
00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:31,739
He thinks his father is filthy.

23
00:04:32,806 --> 00:04:34,007
But I'm not.

24
00:04:35,776 --> 00:04:36,810
[Murphy] Who's that?

25
00:04:37,711 --> 00:04:38,812
Who's that?

26
00:04:41,749 --> 00:04:42,583
Who's that right there?

27
00:04:42,616 --> 00:04:43,451
[Gaspar] Mama.

28
00:04:43,484 --> 00:04:46,387
(Groaning)

29
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:48,756
[Voiceover] Why is
Electra's mother calling me?

30
00:04:56,897 --> 00:04:58,298
[Gaspar] Mama.

31
00:05:03,036 --> 00:05:06,707
[Voiceover] Oh my God,
this is a nightmare.

32
00:05:07,875 --> 00:05:10,077
I wish I didn't exist right now.

33
00:05:11,745 --> 00:05:13,581
This place is a cage.

34
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:19,620
So early.

35
00:05:28,896 --> 00:05:31,499
It seems strange that
she would call right now.

36
00:05:33,834 --> 00:05:35,403
Not a good sign.

37
00:05:39,973 --> 00:05:44,978
[Answering Machine] (speaking
French).

38
00:05:47,881 --> 00:05:51,118
[Voiceover] Hi, this
is Electra's mother.

39
00:05:51,151 --> 00:05:55,456
Sorry to bother you on
a first of January but,

40
00:05:55,489 --> 00:06:00,127
I haven't had news from my
daughter for the last two
months.

41
00:06:01,061 --> 00:06:02,596
[Omi] Baby, you want some tea
or coffee?

42
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:04,097
[Voiceover] Shit, this is not
good.

43
00:06:06,066 --> 00:06:08,068
It sounds like bad news.

44
00:06:14,575 --> 00:06:16,376
It seems so long ago.

45
00:06:17,978 --> 00:06:20,080
It seems like another lifetime.

46
00:06:22,916 --> 00:06:24,084
Two years.

47
00:06:25,519 --> 00:06:26,620
I miss her.

48
00:06:27,755 --> 00:06:29,557
I miss her so much.

49
00:06:32,893 --> 00:06:34,828
I wish she was here right now.

50
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:44,872
(Phone ringing)

51
00:06:52,179 --> 00:06:53,581
[Voiceover] Hello?

52
00:06:53,614 --> 00:06:54,582
Nora.

53
00:06:54,915 --> 00:06:56,650
[Voiceover] Yes, who is it?

54
00:06:59,019 --> 00:07:00,087
Who is it?

55
00:07:01,221 --> 00:07:02,790
[Murphy] It's Murphy.

56
00:07:03,491 --> 00:07:04,558
How are you?

57
00:07:04,992 --> 00:07:06,460
[Voiceover] What do you want?

58
00:07:07,127 --> 00:07:08,161
[Murphy] Uhm...

59
00:07:10,197 --> 00:07:11,965
I've been trying to get a hold
of Electra

60
00:07:11,999 --> 00:07:14,735
And I've been calling her, and,

61
00:07:14,768 --> 00:07:17,070
She hasn't been answering, I was
wondering

62
00:07:17,104 --> 00:07:18,338
If maybe she got a new phone?

63
00:07:18,371 --> 00:07:22,142
[Voiceover] I won't tell
you, you should be ashamed!

64
00:07:22,175 --> 00:07:23,677
You destroyed everything!

65
00:07:23,711 --> 00:07:24,778
[Murphy] Listen, can you
please...

66
00:07:24,812 --> 00:07:25,312
[Voiceover] You have
destroyed my daughter,

67
00:07:25,345 --> 00:07:26,980
My only daughter!

68
00:07:27,014 --> 00:07:28,215
[Murphy] Can you please
just give me her number

69
00:07:28,248 --> 00:07:29,883
So I can speak with her, any
way at all, then I can just...

70
00:07:29,917 --> 00:07:31,251
[Voiceover] What do you think?

71
00:07:31,284 --> 00:07:33,921
You're just garbage, you
have always been a liar!

72
00:07:33,954 --> 00:07:34,922
[Murphy] Listen, you need
to understand that I love

73
00:07:34,955 --> 00:07:36,990
Your daughter very much,
and it's very important

74
00:07:37,024 --> 00:07:37,958
That I talk to her.

75
00:07:37,991 --> 00:07:40,661
[Voiceover] Leave us alone, go
to hell!

76
00:07:40,694 --> 00:07:44,464
[Murphy] Hello, hello?

77
00:08:02,315 --> 00:08:05,085
[Voiceover] Hi, this
is Electra's mother.

78
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:09,156
Sorry to bother you on a first
of January,

79
00:08:09,189 --> 00:08:13,226
But I haven't had news from my
daughter

80
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:15,195
For the last two months,

81
00:08:15,228 --> 00:08:18,131
And I'm worried.

82
00:08:18,165 --> 00:08:21,268
And I know that she was

83
00:08:21,301 --> 00:08:25,606
In a suicidal mood, if you can
call me,

84
00:08:25,639 --> 00:08:29,042
It would be nice, I'm very, very
worried,

85
00:08:29,076 --> 00:08:30,611
Thank you.

86
00:08:40,754 --> 00:08:41,789
Who was it?

87
00:08:42,756 --> 00:08:44,524
[Voiceover] I wish she'd just
shut up.

88
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:48,862
Who is hungry?

89
00:08:55,836 --> 00:08:58,071
Papa!

90
00:08:59,873 --> 00:09:00,941
Thank you.

91
00:09:00,974 --> 00:09:05,345
(Gaspar playfully chattering)

92
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:08,015
You have become a bit,
a little bit fat no?

93
00:09:08,649 --> 00:09:09,883
[Voiceover] Yeah, I'm fat.

94
00:09:09,917 --> 00:09:11,084
Don't ya?

95
00:09:12,653 --> 00:09:14,187
[Voiceover] My dick is fat.

96
00:09:20,628 --> 00:09:22,696
She's so bitter sometimes.

97
00:09:23,631 --> 00:09:25,065
I think Daddy is pregnant.

98
00:09:28,769 --> 00:09:30,671
[Voiceover] There is
nothing for me here.

99
00:09:31,905 --> 00:09:33,974
Except for this little guy.

100
00:09:35,042 --> 00:09:37,244
I hope she won't turn him gay.

101
00:09:37,978 --> 00:09:39,046
[Omi] Do you know how babies
like you

102
00:09:39,079 --> 00:09:40,580
Come to this world?

103
00:09:41,248 --> 00:09:45,986
(Heavy moaning)
(frolicking music)

104
00:10:26,093 --> 00:10:27,294
What happened?

105
00:10:28,361 --> 00:10:29,697
It broke.

106
00:10:33,867 --> 00:10:35,135
But did you come?

107
00:10:35,168 --> 00:10:39,406
(Heaving)
(frolicking music)

108
00:10:53,721 --> 00:10:54,822
Murphy?

109
00:11:03,130 --> 00:11:04,765
I need to tell you something.

110
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:19,112
I think I'm pregnant.

111
00:11:31,825 --> 00:11:33,460
I took a pregnancy test today.

112
00:11:35,128 --> 00:11:36,730
And it was positive.

113
00:11:45,505 --> 00:11:47,107
You wanna see it?

114
00:11:59,052 --> 00:12:01,922
Two stripes means positive.

115
00:12:14,001 --> 00:12:15,836
Can we do another one?

116
00:12:17,370 --> 00:12:18,972
Yeah, sure.

117
00:12:35,322 --> 00:12:36,489
Oh...

118
00:13:04,184 --> 00:13:09,022
(Calming music)

119
00:13:12,492 --> 00:13:14,127
Who was that on the phone?

120
00:13:16,096 --> 00:13:17,865
[Voiceover] How can I lie to
her?

121
00:13:21,969 --> 00:13:24,371
It was the mother of an old
friend.

122
00:13:26,874 --> 00:13:28,275
Are you sure?

123
00:13:28,308 --> 00:13:30,177
[Voiceover] Maybe I should
tell her.

124
00:13:31,111 --> 00:13:33,313
Sometimes it's better not to
lie.

125
00:13:47,094 --> 00:13:48,962
I'm sick of this bitch.

126
00:13:49,897 --> 00:13:51,464
Go take care of the baby,

127
00:13:52,299 --> 00:13:55,402
And leave me alone, please.

128
00:13:59,306 --> 00:14:02,442
She tricked me, I know she did.

129
00:14:04,611 --> 00:14:06,546
Living with a woman,

130
00:14:06,579 --> 00:14:09,416
Is like sharing a bed with the
CIA.

131
00:14:10,617 --> 00:14:12,252
Nothing is secret.

132
00:14:14,922 --> 00:14:17,090
This used to be my apartment.

133
00:14:18,058 --> 00:14:19,893
I used to be happy here.

134
00:14:21,128 --> 00:14:23,530
It doesn't feel like my place
anymore.

135
00:14:26,433 --> 00:14:28,635
I'm always looking over my
shoulder now.

136
00:14:33,173 --> 00:14:35,108
My last secret corner.

137
00:14:37,644 --> 00:14:40,013
My last private space.

138
00:14:41,648 --> 00:14:44,084
The only thing left of my life.

139
00:14:47,454 --> 00:14:49,622
I remember when she gave me
this.

140
00:14:58,231 --> 00:15:02,202
Let's try to protect,
protect each other.

141
00:15:19,452 --> 00:15:20,653
Opium.

142
00:15:22,689 --> 00:15:23,991
Do you wanna take it now?

143
00:15:24,024 --> 00:15:24,924
No.

144
00:15:26,393 --> 00:15:28,095
Keep it for...

145
00:15:29,262 --> 00:15:30,697
If something bad happen in your
life,

146
00:15:30,730 --> 00:15:32,232
And I'm not there.

147
00:15:34,134 --> 00:15:36,069
It will protect you.

148
00:15:41,208 --> 00:15:42,209
Okay?

149
00:15:47,147 --> 00:15:48,348
What's wrong?

150
00:15:52,419 --> 00:15:53,987
Omi is pregnant.

151
00:15:58,058 --> 00:15:59,226
What?

152
00:16:00,727 --> 00:16:02,429
Omi is pregnant?

153
00:16:03,296 --> 00:16:04,464
Wow.

154
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:08,168
Of who?

155
00:16:17,044 --> 00:16:18,211
Of who?

156
00:16:25,818 --> 00:16:26,686
(Spits)

157
00:16:34,194 --> 00:16:36,529
Eat your shit and die.

158
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:41,534
(Door slamming shut)

159
00:16:42,702 --> 00:16:47,440
(Club music)

160
00:17:00,487 --> 00:17:02,489
That's her over there man, you
see her?

161
00:17:02,522 --> 00:17:04,757
I don't give a fuck,
let it go, all right?

162
00:17:04,791 --> 00:17:05,725
What?

163
00:17:05,758 --> 00:17:07,460
It's done, you're done
with her, it's done.

164
00:17:07,494 --> 00:17:09,096
Who is she dancing with?

165
00:17:09,129 --> 00:17:10,363
Who cares?

166
00:17:10,397 --> 00:17:12,532
- Who cares, what are you
talking about?
- Who gives a fuck?

167
00:17:13,266 --> 00:17:14,267
Let's go, all right?

168
00:17:15,268 --> 00:17:16,303
Electra!

169
00:17:22,442 --> 00:17:24,377
Electra, I wanna talk to you!

170
00:17:31,851 --> 00:17:33,486
Electra hey, I wanna talk to
you!

171
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:37,457
(Speaking French)

172
00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:38,691
Leave me alone!

173
00:17:38,725 --> 00:17:42,795
(Shouting over each other)

174
00:17:44,464 --> 00:17:45,565
Hey, what you did to me,

175
00:17:45,598 --> 00:17:46,799
May just have pissed me off,
but...

176
00:17:46,833 --> 00:17:49,336
No, (music drowns out
Electra).

177
00:17:49,369 --> 00:17:51,171
I need to talk to you!

178
00:17:51,204 --> 00:17:53,206
(Shouting over each other)

179
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:54,374
Don't touch me!

180
00:17:54,874 --> 00:17:56,876
Don't touch you, who the fuck
is that?

181
00:17:56,909 --> 00:17:58,178
Go away from me, you're
fucking

182
00:17:58,211 --> 00:18:00,213
Having a baby with a slut.

183
00:18:00,913 --> 00:18:02,615
I didn't want this to happen,

184
00:18:02,649 --> 00:18:03,650
I didn't want this just to
happen!

185
00:18:03,683 --> 00:18:04,884
Why won't you have an
abortion?

186
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:06,319
We made a promise together.

187
00:18:06,353 --> 00:18:07,720
Yeah, and you failed on that!

188
00:18:07,754 --> 00:18:08,588
I belong to you!

189
00:18:08,621 --> 00:18:09,322
You're a loser!

190
00:18:09,356 --> 00:18:09,889
You belong to me!

191
00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:11,391
You're a loser!

192
00:18:11,424 --> 00:18:12,659
I wanna have a baby with you!

193
00:18:12,692 --> 00:18:13,726
You're a loser like...

194
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:14,694
I love you!

195
00:18:14,727 --> 00:18:15,428
Go home!

196
00:18:15,462 --> 00:18:16,629
I love you!

197
00:18:16,663 --> 00:18:18,165
You have never loved me!

198
00:18:18,198 --> 00:18:21,368
[Murphy] Hey, fuck off, hey,
Electra!

199
00:18:21,401 --> 00:18:25,738
(Music drowns out Electra)

200
00:18:27,207 --> 00:18:28,541
You're fucking with me!

201
00:18:28,575 --> 00:18:29,642
I'm not fucking
with you,

202
00:18:29,676 --> 00:18:30,810
I want to be alone!

203
00:18:30,843 --> 00:18:31,744
Do you see that?

204
00:18:31,778 --> 00:18:32,912
No!

205
00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:35,348
Disappear from my life!

206
00:18:35,382 --> 00:18:37,817
You are a fucking selfish

207
00:18:37,850 --> 00:18:40,420
Cruel person, you're killing me,

208
00:18:40,453 --> 00:18:42,322
You're going to kill me.

209
00:18:42,822 --> 00:18:44,457
[Murphy] I love you so much.

210
00:18:44,491 --> 00:18:45,392
I hate you!

211
00:18:45,425 --> 00:18:46,226
I love you so much.

212
00:18:46,259 --> 00:18:46,859
I hate you!

213
00:18:46,893 --> 00:18:47,827
I love you...

214
00:18:52,665 --> 00:18:54,767
I'm the one that's hurting right
now.

215
00:18:54,801 --> 00:18:59,339
(Sad music)

216
00:19:28,901 --> 00:19:32,305
Electra, I love you, do you hear
me?

217
00:19:32,339 --> 00:19:33,706
I love you!

218
00:19:34,541 --> 00:19:36,476
I know you're listening to me!

219
00:19:36,509 --> 00:19:39,279
Electra, I know you can hear
this!

220
00:19:41,448 --> 00:19:44,217
Answer me, please!

221
00:19:44,251 --> 00:19:45,418
Please!

222
00:19:45,452 --> 00:19:49,856
(Sad music)

223
00:19:58,030 --> 00:19:59,732
Electra open the door!

224
00:20:01,501 --> 00:20:03,303
Electra open the door!

225
00:20:05,305 --> 00:20:07,607
(Crying)

226
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:09,242
Open the door, baby.

227
00:20:11,978 --> 00:20:14,714
Please open the door, you
fucking...

228
00:20:14,747 --> 00:20:18,851
(Crying)

229
00:20:26,793 --> 00:20:29,529
Open the door, you selfish cunt!

230
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:34,734
Please open the door!

231
00:20:34,767 --> 00:20:39,506
(Crying)

232
00:20:42,975 --> 00:20:44,311
No...

233
00:20:45,812 --> 00:20:47,414
No...

234
00:20:47,447 --> 00:20:48,948
Go away!

235
00:20:49,916 --> 00:20:52,552
Go away, go!

236
00:20:52,585 --> 00:20:54,354
Piss off now!

237
00:20:54,387 --> 00:20:58,891
(Screaming)
(metal music)

238
00:21:00,393 --> 00:21:04,864
(Door banging)
(screaming)

239
00:21:10,069 --> 00:21:11,971
You're a piece of shit!

240
00:21:12,605 --> 00:21:14,841
You're a piece of shit!

241
00:21:15,875 --> 00:21:17,510
You're an asshole!

242
00:21:18,478 --> 00:21:21,948
You piece of shit!

243
00:21:21,981 --> 00:21:23,883
I'm going to fucking kill you.

244
00:21:23,916 --> 00:21:27,053
(Murphy is drowned out by the
music)

245
00:21:28,488 --> 00:21:30,390
Chill, relax Bro.

246
00:21:30,423 --> 00:21:31,424
No!

247
00:21:34,394 --> 00:21:35,728
[Murphy] You fucking junkie!

248
00:21:35,762 --> 00:21:40,667
(Screaming)
(scuffling)

249
00:21:41,701 --> 00:21:43,069
No, no!

250
00:21:46,005 --> 00:21:48,107
No, no!
(door banging)

251
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:51,644
No, no!

252
00:21:52,645 --> 00:21:54,447
No!

253
00:21:56,383 --> 00:22:01,020
(Metal music)

254
00:22:08,094 --> 00:22:09,396
Hey Julio.

255
00:22:09,829 --> 00:22:11,898
Yeah, what do you
want?

256
00:22:11,931 --> 00:22:14,000
[Murphy] You piece of
shit, listen you junkie fuck.

257
00:22:14,033 --> 00:22:15,602
Yo, yo, yo,
all right, chill, chill,

258
00:22:15,635 --> 00:22:16,469
Don't be jealous.

259
00:22:16,503 --> 00:22:17,136
[Murphy] Jealous of what?

260
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:18,004
What?

261
00:22:18,037 --> 00:22:18,905
[Murphy] Jealous of what?

262
00:22:18,938 --> 00:22:19,939
Jealous of what?!

263
00:22:19,972 --> 00:22:20,807
[Murphy] Yeah, jealous of
what!

264
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:21,874
You know what.

265
00:22:21,908 --> 00:22:22,942
[Murphy] No no, no, I don't
know.

266
00:22:22,975 --> 00:22:23,810
Let me talk, hey
come on.

267
00:22:23,843 --> 00:22:24,343
[Murphy] Tell me, jealous of
what?

268
00:22:24,377 --> 00:22:25,177
[Voiceover] Relax.

269
00:22:25,211 --> 00:22:25,878
[Murphy] Fucking explain it to
me.

270
00:22:25,912 --> 00:22:27,947
Are you fucking my girlfriend?

271
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:29,115
[Voiceover] No, I'm not
fucking your girlfrend.

272
00:22:29,148 --> 00:22:29,949
[Murphy] Are you fucking my
girlfriend?

273
00:22:29,982 --> 00:22:30,783
[Voiceover] No, no man.

274
00:22:30,817 --> 00:22:32,985
But she likes coke, what I can
say?

275
00:22:33,019 --> 00:22:34,754
[Murphy] She likes coke?

276
00:22:34,787 --> 00:22:36,088
[Voiceover] Yeah, you brought
her there.

277
00:22:36,122 --> 00:22:37,123
[Murphy] So what, you're
doing blow with her?

278
00:22:37,156 --> 00:22:37,757
[Voiceover] You put her there
man,

279
00:22:37,790 --> 00:22:39,559
You fucking put her there.

280
00:22:39,992 --> 00:22:41,060
[Murphy] I put her there?

281
00:22:41,093 --> 00:22:43,129
[Voiceover] Yeah, you put her
there.

282
00:22:43,162 --> 00:22:44,163
[Murphy] Really, how does that
work?

283
00:22:44,196 --> 00:22:45,031
[Voiceover] You put her up to
it.

284
00:22:45,064 --> 00:22:46,566
Explain that to me, explain it
to me

285
00:22:46,599 --> 00:22:48,801
You sick little fuck, you little
weasel.

286
00:22:48,835 --> 00:22:49,902
[Voiceover] Hey, hey.

287
00:22:49,936 --> 00:22:51,704
Where the fuck is she?

288
00:22:52,505 --> 00:22:54,907
[Voiceover] Listen, that's
what she says all the time,

289
00:22:54,941 --> 00:22:56,576
You gave her the first line,

290
00:22:56,609 --> 00:22:58,578
And then you start
fucking all these girls,

291
00:22:58,611 --> 00:23:00,780
Cheating on her, so what's up,
you know?

292
00:23:00,813 --> 00:23:03,015
Be a man about it, man up.

293
00:23:03,650 --> 00:23:04,917
Stay away from her.

294
00:23:05,552 --> 00:23:08,054
Don't be a pussy and start
smashing her.

295
00:23:08,087 --> 00:23:08,921
I knew you...

296
00:23:08,955 --> 00:23:09,656
[Murphy] Don't be a what?

297
00:23:10,790 --> 00:23:11,691
[Voiceover] Hey listen buddy...

298
00:23:11,724 --> 00:23:14,494
[Murphy] I don't even know
what to say

299
00:23:14,527 --> 00:23:15,628
To you right now.

300
00:23:15,662 --> 00:23:18,531
You better pray to God we
don't run into each other.

301
00:23:18,565 --> 00:23:21,534
[Voiceover] Pfft, okay,
okay, you know what?

302
00:23:21,568 --> 00:23:22,869
[Murphy] What, what?

303
00:23:22,902 --> 00:23:24,003
[Voiceover] Just let it
go, and just tell your mom

304
00:23:24,036 --> 00:23:25,905
That you lost a friend and
you lost your girlfriend.

305
00:23:25,938 --> 00:23:27,106
[Murphy] Hey, hey, you
little fuck, when I fucking

306
00:23:27,139 --> 00:23:28,741
Find you, I'm gonna
take your fucking balls

307
00:23:28,775 --> 00:23:30,977
And I'm gonna shove 'em
up your fucking ass.

308
00:23:31,010 --> 00:23:32,979
I'm gonna fuck you in
the ass so fucking hard

309
00:23:33,012 --> 00:23:34,681
Your head explodes.

310
00:23:35,648 --> 00:23:38,785
[Voiceover] Hey, needle
dick, shut the fuck up.

311
00:23:38,818 --> 00:23:40,052
[Murphy] Needle dick, really?

312
00:23:40,086 --> 00:23:41,688
[Voiceover] Hey listen,
I gotta go, I gotta go.

313
00:23:41,721 --> 00:23:43,189
I got some people to see, peace.

314
00:23:43,222 --> 00:23:43,990
Don't fucking hang up the
phone,

315
00:23:44,023 --> 00:23:45,725
Do not hang up the fucking
phone!

316
00:23:45,758 --> 00:23:46,793
Listen to me, listen to me,

317
00:23:46,826 --> 00:23:49,161
If you fucking touch my
girlfriend, if you fucking

318
00:23:49,195 --> 00:23:52,164
Lay one fucking finger on her,
ever again,

319
00:23:52,198 --> 00:23:54,667
I will fucking rip your head
off.

320
00:23:55,702 --> 00:23:58,204
[Voiceover] All right,
peace bro, have a good night.

321
00:24:01,541 --> 00:24:04,076
Julio, Julio.

322
00:24:04,811 --> 00:24:06,178
Don't hang up the phone, Julio.

323
00:24:06,212 --> 00:24:10,082
(Sad music)

324
00:24:20,793 --> 00:24:22,128
I love you.

325
00:24:23,295 --> 00:24:25,998
(Gaspar crying)

326
00:24:26,032 --> 00:24:27,099
[Voiceover] Me too.

327
00:24:27,133 --> 00:24:31,103
(Gaspar crying)

328
00:24:38,545 --> 00:24:39,746
Where are you going?

329
00:24:43,783 --> 00:24:44,951
I don't know, out.

330
00:24:44,984 --> 00:24:48,988
(Gaspar crying)

331
00:24:49,756 --> 00:24:51,123
You haven't really been here all
day,

332
00:24:51,157 --> 00:24:52,559
Where are you?

333
00:24:55,127 --> 00:24:56,729
Electra's mother called.

334
00:24:59,031 --> 00:25:00,800
She hasn't heard from her in
three months.

335
00:25:00,833 --> 00:25:02,034
Oh, Electra.

336
00:25:02,068 --> 00:25:03,670
[Murphy] She's worried
about her, and I think

337
00:25:03,703 --> 00:25:05,137
She might've hurt herself.

338
00:25:05,938 --> 00:25:07,139
You know what?

339
00:25:07,173 --> 00:25:10,577
Take care of your past, and
then I take care of your future.

340
00:25:10,610 --> 00:25:14,180
(Gaspar crying)

341
00:25:18,918 --> 00:25:19,986
(Door slamming shut)

342
00:25:32,865 --> 00:25:35,534
[Voiceover] She said we
could do anything together.

343
00:25:38,871 --> 00:25:40,940
But there's one thing we never
did.

344
00:25:40,973 --> 00:25:45,211
(Melancholic music)

345
00:25:48,681 --> 00:25:53,185
(Gaspar playfully chirping)

346
00:25:59,959 --> 00:26:01,728
We never made a baby.

347
00:26:06,398 --> 00:26:07,600
No.

348
00:26:10,136 --> 00:26:11,904
Can you show me?

349
00:26:14,006 --> 00:26:16,208
How tender you can be?

350
00:26:21,881 --> 00:26:26,886
(Soft moaning)
(melancholic music)

351
00:27:35,888 --> 00:27:38,991
Did you ever try sex

352
00:27:40,126 --> 00:27:41,427
On opium?

353
00:27:44,030 --> 00:27:44,931
No.

354
00:27:45,397 --> 00:27:46,365
It's great.

355
00:27:49,135 --> 00:27:51,037
Very chill.

356
00:27:53,740 --> 00:27:55,374
What's the best?

357
00:28:02,048 --> 00:28:03,415
Opium.

358
00:28:03,449 --> 00:28:05,184
That's the best sex?

359
00:28:06,118 --> 00:28:07,153
Hmm-mm.

360
00:28:20,432 --> 00:28:22,034
[Voiceover] Electra...

361
00:28:24,470 --> 00:28:27,073
This is the only way we can be
close.

362
00:28:29,909 --> 00:28:31,978
Having you inside me again.

363
00:28:32,011 --> 00:28:36,348
(Sad music)

364
00:28:39,886 --> 00:28:41,487
Now you're inside.

365
00:28:43,355 --> 00:28:44,791
I miss you.

366
00:28:50,229 --> 00:28:51,430
Electra?

367
00:28:53,265 --> 00:28:54,400
Hmm?

368
00:28:55,167 --> 00:28:59,038
What is your ultimate fantasy?

369
00:29:06,078 --> 00:29:07,479
Sex-wise?

370
00:29:08,948 --> 00:29:10,049
Sure.

371
00:29:17,189 --> 00:29:20,059
Fuck with another girl, and
you.

372
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:22,394
Fuck with another girl?

373
00:29:23,362 --> 00:29:24,196
And me.

374
00:29:24,230 --> 00:29:25,932
This is my dream too.

375
00:29:30,002 --> 00:29:33,105
A blond, pretty.

376
00:29:33,139 --> 00:29:34,306
Oh, blond?

377
00:29:34,340 --> 00:29:35,407
Nice girl.

378
00:29:36,208 --> 00:29:37,910
You like blond girls?

379
00:29:44,283 --> 00:29:45,417
(Speaking French)

380
00:29:46,618 --> 00:29:47,920
[Omi] Hi.

381
00:29:47,954 --> 00:29:49,188
Do you speak English?

382
00:29:49,221 --> 00:29:50,522
[Omi] Yeah I speak English.

383
00:29:50,556 --> 00:29:51,958
Are you the new neighbor?

384
00:29:51,991 --> 00:29:53,860
[Omi] Yes, I just moved in.

385
00:29:53,893 --> 00:29:54,493
Cool.

386
00:29:54,526 --> 00:29:56,395
Yeah, (giggling), yeah,

387
00:29:56,428 --> 00:29:58,064
So I guess, see you around.

388
00:29:58,097 --> 00:29:58,630
Yes.

389
00:29:58,664 --> 00:30:00,432
Yeah, (giggling), bye.

390
00:30:18,184 --> 00:30:19,151
Hi.

391
00:30:20,619 --> 00:30:21,620
[Electra] Hey.

392
00:30:21,653 --> 00:30:22,889
Hey.

393
00:30:24,423 --> 00:30:25,892
How are you?

394
00:30:28,627 --> 00:30:29,361
[Murphy] Good.

395
00:30:29,395 --> 00:30:30,496
Yeah?

396
00:30:30,529 --> 00:30:32,098
[Electra] Do you wanna hang
out later?

397
00:30:32,131 --> 00:30:33,232
Hmm?

398
00:30:34,901 --> 00:30:35,935
Yeah.

399
00:30:35,968 --> 00:30:37,303
[Electra] We can go eat
something.

400
00:30:37,336 --> 00:30:39,105
Yeah, cool.

401
00:30:40,039 --> 00:30:41,640
Thank you, yeah, thank you
so much for inviting me.

402
00:30:41,673 --> 00:30:42,942
[Murphy] Oh come on.

403
00:30:42,975 --> 00:30:44,076
[Electra] Oh, it's nothing.

404
00:30:44,110 --> 00:30:45,411
The pleasure is all ours.

405
00:30:46,645 --> 00:30:48,414
(Giggles)

406
00:30:49,982 --> 00:30:51,483
So do you have family here?

407
00:30:51,517 --> 00:30:54,053
No, I haven't, no.

408
00:30:54,086 --> 00:30:54,987
Where are your parents?

409
00:30:55,021 --> 00:30:56,322
Uh, I don't know.

410
00:30:56,355 --> 00:30:58,424
I was an accident, so.

411
00:30:59,025 --> 00:31:00,459
What do you mean?

412
00:31:00,492 --> 00:31:03,930
Well, I've, they
didn't want me, kind of.

413
00:31:06,498 --> 00:31:08,367
She wanted, your mother wanted
to,

414
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:09,435
Have an abortion, like that?

415
00:31:09,468 --> 00:31:11,270
Yeah, yeah, I think so.

416
00:31:11,303 --> 00:31:13,205
She has acted like that
all of her life, so,

417
00:31:13,239 --> 00:31:15,041
And I never knew my dad, so
yeah.

418
00:31:17,076 --> 00:31:19,111
(Sighs) Did you ever have an
abortion?

419
00:31:19,145 --> 00:31:20,346
No.

420
00:31:20,379 --> 00:31:21,513
Good.

421
00:31:22,648 --> 00:31:23,515
Me neither.

422
00:31:23,549 --> 00:31:25,918
Okay, I'm happy to hear that.

423
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:29,288
Nothing like...

424
00:31:29,321 --> 00:31:32,658
Although, I would have
to say I am pro-choice.

425
00:31:32,691 --> 00:31:34,093
Really?

426
00:31:34,126 --> 00:31:35,127
Yeah.

427
00:31:35,995 --> 00:31:37,096
And you're not?

428
00:31:37,129 --> 00:31:38,430
I'm pro-life.

429
00:31:38,464 --> 00:31:39,398
You're pro-life?

430
00:31:39,431 --> 00:31:39,966
Yeah!

431
00:31:39,999 --> 00:31:40,832
Really?

432
00:31:40,866 --> 00:31:42,401
Well otherwise I wouldn't be
here.

433
00:31:42,434 --> 00:31:43,902
Okay so...

434
00:31:45,404 --> 00:31:48,174
You're against abortion,
but you're cool with

435
00:31:48,207 --> 00:31:50,943
People killing animals
and then eating them?

436
00:31:51,343 --> 00:31:52,478
Yeah but that's...

437
00:31:53,079 --> 00:31:55,447
Ah, that's two different things.

438
00:31:56,048 --> 00:31:58,350
You know, like, it's part
of nature to eat meat,

439
00:31:58,384 --> 00:32:01,120
You know, you come here,
eat meat, make babies.

440
00:32:01,487 --> 00:32:02,955
(Laughs)

441
00:32:02,989 --> 00:32:03,956
Yeah, don't you agree?

442
00:32:03,990 --> 00:32:05,291
I guess so.

443
00:32:06,058 --> 00:32:07,693
What about drugs, are you
pro-drugs?

444
00:32:07,726 --> 00:32:08,760
Do you like getting high?

445
00:32:08,794 --> 00:32:11,597
Well, it's also really
natural to smoke, I think,

446
00:32:11,630 --> 00:32:13,565
They have been smoking a
thousand years,

447
00:32:13,599 --> 00:32:16,368
A million years, like they
found a little leaf, like...

448
00:32:16,402 --> 00:32:18,104
Do you wanna smoke a natural
joint

449
00:32:18,137 --> 00:32:20,172
Over at our place, after this?

450
00:32:20,206 --> 00:32:21,673
Yeah, I would love to.

451
00:32:22,774 --> 00:32:27,980
(Melancholic music)

452
00:33:46,758 --> 00:33:48,494
You're a really sweet couple.

453
00:33:50,729 --> 00:33:52,664
You are a really sweet
neighbor.

454
00:33:56,368 --> 00:33:58,070
How old are you?

455
00:33:58,104 --> 00:34:01,473
Hmm, 17.

456
00:34:04,176 --> 00:34:04,710
17?

457
00:34:04,743 --> 00:34:05,811
Yes.

458
00:34:07,246 --> 00:34:09,115
Like, soon.

459
00:34:11,383 --> 00:34:13,152
I fucking love Europe.

460
00:34:13,185 --> 00:34:15,754
(Laughing)

461
00:34:19,191 --> 00:34:20,492
Give me that.

462
00:34:23,362 --> 00:34:28,267
(Relaxing music)
(soft moaning)

463
00:42:13,031 --> 00:42:18,003
(Phone dialing)

464
00:42:26,645 --> 00:42:28,980
[Voiceover] Hi, this
is Nora's voicemail.

465
00:42:29,715 --> 00:42:32,918
You can leave a message
after the beep tone.

466
00:42:32,951 --> 00:42:35,854
Please do know that I'll be out
of Paris

467
00:42:35,887 --> 00:42:38,323
Until the fifth of January.

468
00:42:39,090 --> 00:42:42,928
I wish you all a very happy New
Year.

469
00:42:42,961 --> 00:42:46,264
(Speaking French)

470
00:42:48,333 --> 00:42:51,770
Hey, this is Murphy.

471
00:42:53,805 --> 00:42:55,206
I'm calling you back.

472
00:42:56,908 --> 00:42:59,210
I haven't heard from Electra

473
00:42:59,244 --> 00:43:03,314
In quite a while.

474
00:43:05,784 --> 00:43:09,220
But I'm just as worried as you
are.

475
00:43:10,989 --> 00:43:15,961
So uhm, maybe you could
give me her new number

476
00:43:15,994 --> 00:43:19,665
Or I could call some of

477
00:43:19,698 --> 00:43:22,801
Of her old friends?

478
00:43:27,973 --> 00:43:30,742
Call me back when you get this,
please,

479
00:43:30,776 --> 00:43:32,110
All right, bye.

480
00:43:40,018 --> 00:43:41,687
[Voiceover] I'm a loser.

481
00:43:43,421 --> 00:43:46,057
Yeah, just a dick.

482
00:43:47,793 --> 00:43:49,761
And a dick has no brain.

483
00:43:55,801 --> 00:43:58,269
A dick has only one purpose.

484
00:43:59,938 --> 00:44:01,106
To fuck.

485
00:44:03,008 --> 00:44:04,910
And I fucked it all up.

486
00:44:08,479 --> 00:44:09,781
Yeah.

487
00:44:10,716 --> 00:44:12,117
I'm good at one thing.

488
00:44:13,284 --> 00:44:15,186
Fucking things up.

489
00:44:18,456 --> 00:44:20,158
But she was hot.

490
00:44:21,159 --> 00:44:22,961
I couldn't resist.

491
00:44:24,329 --> 00:44:26,064
I had to get inside there.

492
00:44:26,097 --> 00:44:30,135
(Calming music)

493
00:44:40,812 --> 00:44:43,448
(Whistling)

494
00:44:48,987 --> 00:44:50,055
[Omi] Hi.

495
00:44:51,056 --> 00:44:52,057
Hey.

496
00:44:53,191 --> 00:44:54,392
[Omi] How are you?

497
00:44:56,494 --> 00:44:58,296
Good, you?

498
00:44:58,329 --> 00:44:59,731
[Omi] Yeah.

499
00:45:01,532 --> 00:45:02,834
Cool.

500
00:45:05,837 --> 00:45:07,138
[Omi] Where's Electra?

501
00:45:09,107 --> 00:45:10,708
She's not here this weekend.

502
00:45:18,549 --> 00:45:20,786
[Omi] Would you like to come
over?

503
00:45:24,055 --> 00:45:28,326
(Moves into slow soft rock
music)

504
00:45:31,029 --> 00:45:35,400
(Soft moaning)

505
00:46:31,456 --> 00:46:33,424
[Voiceover] I'm really stoned
right now.

506
00:46:36,561 --> 00:46:38,830
Electra, I wish you were here.

507
00:46:39,630 --> 00:46:41,432
Taking opium with me.

508
00:46:43,268 --> 00:46:45,170
My body feels amazing.

509
00:46:46,872 --> 00:46:48,439
And the rain is sweet.

510
00:46:50,575 --> 00:46:51,943
Sweet...

511
00:46:53,111 --> 00:46:54,412
Sweet...

512
00:47:00,418 --> 00:47:02,153
If we had a baby,

513
00:47:03,288 --> 00:47:04,956
What would you name it?

514
00:47:08,026 --> 00:47:09,260
[Electra] And you?

515
00:47:14,132 --> 00:47:15,500
If it was a boy?

516
00:47:21,039 --> 00:47:22,507
Maybe Gaspar.

517
00:47:23,274 --> 00:47:24,842
[Electra] Gaspar?

518
00:47:25,176 --> 00:47:25,710
Yeah.

519
00:47:25,743 --> 00:47:30,348
(Slow soft rock music)

520
00:47:47,398 --> 00:47:49,000
Gaspar.

521
00:47:51,469 --> 00:47:53,238
You wanna call it Gaspar?

522
00:47:54,505 --> 00:47:55,640
Yeah.

523
00:47:59,477 --> 00:48:00,611
Gaspar.

524
00:48:00,645 --> 00:48:05,383
(Slow soft rock music)

525
00:48:15,293 --> 00:48:16,627
[Voiceover] I need to sit up.

526
00:48:19,097 --> 00:48:20,431
I'm too stoned.

527
00:48:24,169 --> 00:48:26,071
Oh God I miss her.

528
00:48:27,505 --> 00:48:29,374
I need to see her face again.

529
00:48:31,276 --> 00:48:32,910
Or I'm never happy.

530
00:48:34,512 --> 00:48:35,546
Yeah...

531
00:48:46,324 --> 00:48:48,126
Love is strange.

532
00:48:51,029 --> 00:48:52,497
I feel like a junkie.

533
00:48:58,469 --> 00:49:00,638
How can something so wonderful,

534
00:49:02,440 --> 00:49:04,075
Bring such great pain.

535
00:49:07,112 --> 00:49:09,347
Maybe it's better to never love
at all.

536
00:49:09,380 --> 00:49:13,618
(Slow soft rock music)

537
00:49:43,814 --> 00:49:45,350
If you die,

538
00:49:48,353 --> 00:49:51,022
I'll have these images to
remember you by.

539
00:49:54,292 --> 00:49:56,094
I don't want to die.

540
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:03,568
I'll cry.

541
00:51:18,143 --> 00:51:22,213
[Voiceover] Hello, this is
Noe International Art Gallery.

542
00:51:22,247 --> 00:51:25,516
We are open from Tuesday
to Saturday from 10:00 AM

543
00:51:25,550 --> 00:51:26,817
To 7:00 PM.

544
00:51:27,518 --> 00:51:29,620
Please leave a message after the
tone,

545
00:51:29,654 --> 00:51:32,089
We will call you back as soon as
possible.

546
00:51:32,523 --> 00:51:33,524
(Beeping)

547
00:51:34,492 --> 00:51:37,462
[Murphy] Hey this is Murphy.

548
00:51:38,329 --> 00:51:41,299
Uhm, trying to get a hold of
you,

549
00:51:41,332 --> 00:51:45,670
I haven't heard from Electra

550
00:51:47,772 --> 00:51:49,674
In a long time and uhm,

551
00:51:51,642 --> 00:51:54,679
Just call me back, when you get
this,

552
00:51:55,813 --> 00:51:58,516
Then I can see if I can help
find her.

553
00:52:00,518 --> 00:52:03,321
Okay, thank you, bye.

554
00:52:08,326 --> 00:52:10,261
[Voiceover] It's true she had
issues.

555
00:52:11,696 --> 00:52:14,131
It's true she was a junkie.

556
00:52:15,900 --> 00:52:18,269
I would forgive everything,

557
00:52:19,370 --> 00:52:21,172
I will always love her,

558
00:52:22,640 --> 00:52:24,475
If she would forgive me.

559
00:52:26,511 --> 00:52:28,846
Please Electra, come back to me.

560
00:52:29,914 --> 00:52:33,318
Come back, come back,

561
00:52:33,984 --> 00:52:35,353
Come back.

562
00:52:35,386 --> 00:52:37,788
(Piano music)

563
00:52:37,822 --> 00:52:39,590
I wanna be in your arms.

564
00:52:40,825 --> 00:52:42,593
I want you to hug me.

565
00:52:43,428 --> 00:52:44,695
To hold me.

566
00:52:45,696 --> 00:52:47,265
Please hug me.

567
00:52:48,233 --> 00:52:49,734
Please hold me.

568
00:52:52,237 --> 00:52:53,838
(Soft moaning)

569
00:52:53,871 --> 00:52:56,274
[Electra] You're so hard this
morning.

570
00:53:00,345 --> 00:53:02,213
Can I fuck you?

571
00:53:02,247 --> 00:53:07,252
(Soft moaning)
(piano music)

572
00:55:36,133 --> 00:55:39,437
I wanna make movies out of
blood,

573
00:55:39,470 --> 00:55:41,439
Sperm and tears.

574
00:55:41,472 --> 00:55:44,041
(Laughs) That's so sweet.

575
00:55:44,909 --> 00:55:47,478
This is like the essence of
life.

576
00:55:48,546 --> 00:55:50,515
I think movies should contain
that,

577
00:55:50,548 --> 00:55:51,949
Or should be made of that.

578
00:55:51,982 --> 00:55:53,718
Which is your favorite movie?

579
00:55:53,751 --> 00:55:55,052
2001.

580
00:55:55,085 --> 00:55:56,854
What do you think of this movie?

581
00:55:56,887 --> 00:55:59,557
Oh, I really never saw.

582
00:55:59,590 --> 00:56:02,059
You've never seen 2001?

583
00:56:02,092 --> 00:56:04,695
What is wrong with you?

584
00:56:05,796 --> 00:56:07,732
You've never seen this movie?

585
00:56:09,033 --> 00:56:10,568
Will you show me?

586
00:56:10,601 --> 00:56:11,902
Yes, I have to!

587
00:56:11,936 --> 00:56:14,605
You're ignorant, I need
to show you the light.

588
00:56:15,540 --> 00:56:17,742
This is like the reason
I wanna be a director.

589
00:56:22,212 --> 00:56:24,815
But I like poetry too.

590
00:56:25,149 --> 00:56:25,983
Yeah?

591
00:56:26,016 --> 00:56:27,852
You want to hear my favorite
poem?

592
00:56:29,587 --> 00:56:30,888
Definitely.

593
00:56:33,524 --> 00:56:35,460
I think it goes something
like,

594
00:56:36,060 --> 00:56:38,863
"The woods are lovely, dark and
deep,"

595
00:56:38,896 --> 00:56:41,098
"But I have promises to keep,"

596
00:56:41,131 --> 00:56:43,501
"And miles to go before I sleep,"

597
00:56:43,534 --> 00:56:46,403
"And miles to go before I
sleep."

598
00:56:57,047 --> 00:56:58,549
What do you think of this
place?

599
00:57:00,785 --> 00:57:01,719
It's cool right?

600
00:57:01,752 --> 00:57:02,920
I love it.

601
00:57:22,039 --> 00:57:26,844
(Relaxing, mysterious music)

602
00:57:40,124 --> 00:57:41,759
What if I got you pregnant?

603
00:57:48,032 --> 00:57:49,767
I think I would be happy.

604
00:57:52,670 --> 00:57:53,804
You think?

605
00:57:56,774 --> 00:57:58,709
If we can make more than one.

606
00:58:00,845 --> 00:58:02,146
You want more?

607
00:58:03,614 --> 00:58:04,181
Seven.

608
00:58:04,214 --> 00:58:05,516
Seven?

609
00:58:07,051 --> 00:58:08,853
This is a reasonable number?

610
00:58:10,621 --> 00:58:11,922
Lucky number.

611
00:58:15,926 --> 00:58:18,062
What are we gonna do
with all these kids?

612
00:58:20,831 --> 00:58:22,232
Start a farm?

613
00:58:28,038 --> 00:58:30,675
A big happy family, that
would make your mom happy,

614
00:58:31,709 --> 00:58:32,810
I think.

615
00:58:34,278 --> 00:58:36,046
I don't really talk about her.

616
00:58:41,586 --> 00:58:43,621
And I'm not sure I can introduce

617
00:58:43,654 --> 00:58:45,289
You to my father.

618
00:58:47,958 --> 00:58:50,294
I think that you are too crazy.

619
00:58:50,961 --> 00:58:53,263
Uh, and what about you
princess?

620
00:58:55,733 --> 00:58:57,201
He doesn't know I drink.

621
00:58:59,303 --> 00:59:01,171
You drink just as much as I
do.

622
00:59:09,213 --> 00:59:11,548
He thinks I'm an angel.

623
00:59:19,056 --> 00:59:20,658
Is he conservative?

624
00:59:22,226 --> 00:59:23,761
Religious?

625
00:59:32,703 --> 00:59:36,707
Electra has a Daddy complex.

626
00:59:49,153 --> 00:59:50,788
I love Paris.

627
00:59:52,256 --> 00:59:54,358
I don't like my past here.

628
00:59:54,391 --> 00:59:57,995
My last five years, but, I like
Paris.

629
00:59:59,930 --> 01:00:01,732
You don't like your past year?

630
01:00:04,401 --> 01:00:07,638
Maybe I don't like my past in
general.

631
01:00:08,305 --> 01:00:11,608
But I see a great future coming.

632
01:00:33,163 --> 01:00:34,631
Long life?

633
01:00:36,934 --> 01:00:38,803
Long life behind you.

634
01:00:41,972 --> 01:00:43,741
It's hard to see what's ahead.

635
01:00:49,379 --> 01:00:50,715
Great love.

636
01:01:01,491 --> 01:01:03,761
I think you should (mumbling).

637
01:01:09,166 --> 01:01:13,904
(Calming music)

638
01:01:23,848 --> 01:01:25,750
Tell me about your
ex-boyfriend.

639
01:01:31,188 --> 01:01:33,123
I loved him a lot.

640
01:01:35,459 --> 01:01:36,961
What was his name?

641
01:01:37,427 --> 01:01:38,428
Noe.

642
01:01:40,865 --> 01:01:42,099
He was nice.

643
01:01:44,835 --> 01:01:46,403
But we don't talk anymore.

644
01:01:51,241 --> 01:01:52,777
He loved me.

645
01:01:57,281 --> 01:02:00,150
He was old, but he wanted
younger.

646
01:02:01,018 --> 01:02:02,252
Younger than you?

647
01:02:02,286 --> 01:02:03,420
Yes.

648
01:02:05,555 --> 01:02:07,391
And your ex-girlfriend?

649
01:02:08,192 --> 01:02:09,359
(Scoffs)

650
01:02:13,998 --> 01:02:18,969
(Soft moaning)
(calming music)

651
01:02:43,327 --> 01:02:44,328
Lucille?

652
01:02:44,361 --> 01:02:45,762
Hmm-mm?

653
01:02:47,397 --> 01:02:49,900
I wanna spend the rest
of my life with you.

654
01:02:58,408 --> 01:03:00,811
Do you have a nice apartment in
Paris?

655
01:03:04,448 --> 01:03:05,549
Yeah.

656
01:03:08,919 --> 01:03:09,954
Why?

657
01:03:12,589 --> 01:03:14,158
I was just wondering if,

658
01:03:14,191 --> 01:03:16,326
If I came there, if I could stay
with you?

659
01:03:25,102 --> 01:03:27,004
You're the love of my life.

660
01:03:45,589 --> 01:03:46,857
Hey?

661
01:03:48,492 --> 01:03:50,160
Can I tell you a secret?

662
01:03:51,628 --> 01:03:56,466
(Soft moaning)

663
01:04:10,580 --> 01:04:12,349
What is your secret?

664
01:04:12,917 --> 01:04:14,118
I forgot.

665
01:04:14,151 --> 01:04:15,452
(Giggling)

666
01:04:24,028 --> 01:04:25,095
I have a secret.

667
01:04:27,064 --> 01:04:28,098
Yes?

668
01:04:41,245 --> 01:04:43,280
So this is your ex's gallery?

669
01:04:43,680 --> 01:04:45,149
It is.

670
01:04:47,117 --> 01:04:48,285
It's huge.

671
01:04:49,719 --> 01:04:50,554
Electra.

672
01:04:50,587 --> 01:04:51,421
Oh.

673
01:04:52,456 --> 01:04:53,390
Good to see you.

674
01:04:53,423 --> 01:04:54,391
[Electra] You too.

675
01:04:54,424 --> 01:04:55,259
How are you?

676
01:04:55,292 --> 01:04:56,260
Fine.

677
01:04:56,293 --> 01:04:57,561
Your brother, I guess?

678
01:04:57,594 --> 01:05:01,065
No, it's Murphy, my boyfriend.

679
01:05:01,098 --> 01:05:02,699
Oh, nice to meet you.

680
01:05:02,732 --> 01:05:03,633
Very nice to meet you.

681
01:05:03,667 --> 01:05:05,235
I told you about him.

682
01:05:05,269 --> 01:05:06,603
You're the artist?

683
01:05:06,636 --> 01:05:08,238
Filmmaker.

684
01:05:08,272 --> 01:05:10,107
Aha, filmmaker.

685
01:05:10,975 --> 01:05:11,976
And what do you do?

686
01:05:12,009 --> 01:05:13,543
I'm making movies.

687
01:05:13,577 --> 01:05:16,013
Ah, here in Paris or in New
York?

688
01:05:16,046 --> 01:05:17,481
Here, Paris.

689
01:05:17,514 --> 01:05:19,516
So you're here for a while?

690
01:05:19,549 --> 01:05:20,985
For a while.

691
01:05:21,018 --> 01:05:22,386
Welcome, welcome.

692
01:05:23,420 --> 01:05:25,389
- [Electra] So?
- [Noe] So, life is good?

693
01:05:25,422 --> 01:05:26,523
Yeah.

694
01:05:26,556 --> 01:05:28,125
Have you been traveling lately?

695
01:05:28,158 --> 01:05:29,526
Yeah, as usual.

696
01:05:31,061 --> 01:05:32,963
Bangkok, with my kids.

697
01:05:33,563 --> 01:05:34,398
It was fun.

698
01:05:34,431 --> 01:05:35,599
Wife and kids?

699
01:05:38,535 --> 01:05:41,271
Hey, I wanna introduce you to
the guy,

700
01:05:41,305 --> 01:05:42,072
Wanna come?

701
01:05:42,106 --> 01:05:43,173
Yeah, yeah.

702
01:05:44,174 --> 01:05:46,543
Can I bring him to the
party you told me about?

703
01:05:46,576 --> 01:05:47,344
Of course?

704
01:05:47,377 --> 01:05:48,345
Oh there's a party?

705
01:05:48,378 --> 01:05:49,146
Yeah next week.

706
01:05:49,179 --> 01:05:50,280
Be my guest.

707
01:05:51,181 --> 01:05:52,983
And bring me your movies one
day.

708
01:05:55,319 --> 01:05:56,453
All right.

709
01:05:56,786 --> 01:05:58,022
Come, come.

710
01:06:13,203 --> 01:06:15,105
[Murphy] Piece of shit.

711
01:06:46,803 --> 01:06:48,205
You're a bitch.

712
01:06:48,238 --> 01:06:49,373
Hey...

713
01:06:50,807 --> 01:06:52,042
[Murphy] Don't touch me.

714
01:06:52,076 --> 01:06:53,310
Come on.

715
01:06:53,777 --> 01:06:54,744
He's a nice guy,

716
01:06:54,778 --> 01:06:58,282
And don't be like so jealous,

717
01:06:58,315 --> 01:06:59,449
It's over between me and him.

718
01:06:59,483 --> 01:07:01,751
Well I hope you got a good
contract.

719
01:07:01,785 --> 01:07:02,752
I hope he pays you a lot.

720
01:07:02,786 --> 01:07:05,722
He just introduced me
to a nice guy, come on.

721
01:07:05,755 --> 01:07:07,291
He wants to fuck you.

722
01:07:07,324 --> 01:07:09,693
No, he, it's over.

723
01:07:13,397 --> 01:07:16,400
Do you think we will
stay together forever?

724
01:07:19,469 --> 01:07:21,171
[Murphy] Forever is a long
time,

725
01:07:23,107 --> 01:07:24,608
I should hope so.

726
01:07:26,276 --> 01:07:28,645
Forever is a long time?

727
01:07:34,651 --> 01:07:36,620
You're not planning to?

728
01:07:38,388 --> 01:07:39,389
Oh...

729
01:07:44,294 --> 01:07:45,862
(Giggling)

730
01:07:45,895 --> 01:07:47,231
What?

731
01:07:48,765 --> 01:07:51,568
I'm a very peaceful person

732
01:07:51,601 --> 01:07:56,106
If you tell me about your
desire.

733
01:08:04,381 --> 01:08:06,250
We have to make a promise,

734
01:08:07,617 --> 01:08:09,319
That from now on,

735
01:08:12,289 --> 01:08:13,490
We're gonna be the greatest
couple

736
01:08:13,523 --> 01:08:14,824
That ever lived.

737
01:08:14,858 --> 01:08:16,793
We were already.

738
01:08:18,262 --> 01:08:19,529
What can we do?

739
01:08:26,170 --> 01:08:29,606
Talk straight away about our
feelings,

740
01:08:29,639 --> 01:08:32,542
Say to each other what we want
to do.

741
01:08:32,576 --> 01:08:35,612
You can do whatever you
want if you ask me to.

742
01:08:36,380 --> 01:08:37,514
Anything I want?

743
01:08:37,547 --> 01:08:41,285
Yes, you can have a lot of
freedom if you ask me, go.

744
01:08:42,319 --> 01:08:42,886
Yes?

745
01:08:42,919 --> 01:08:44,188
Yes.

746
01:08:44,621 --> 01:08:47,724
Do you still love me?

747
01:08:49,593 --> 01:08:51,127
You know I do.

748
01:08:57,867 --> 01:08:59,703
Do you still love me?

749
01:09:00,704 --> 01:09:02,606
Yes, are you drunk?

750
01:09:02,639 --> 01:09:04,608
(Giggling)

751
01:09:04,641 --> 01:09:05,775
I just want a

752
01:09:06,843 --> 01:09:09,779
Sincere answer.

753
01:09:12,249 --> 01:09:13,683
I fucking love you.

754
01:09:14,584 --> 01:09:15,885
I feel it.

755
01:09:25,429 --> 01:09:27,331
[Murphy] Hey, drink.

756
01:09:32,269 --> 01:09:32,902
You know what?

757
01:09:32,936 --> 01:09:33,970
No?

758
01:09:34,003 --> 01:09:35,239
What?

759
01:09:35,272 --> 01:09:36,273
[Murphy] Do you wanna be in my
movie?

760
01:09:47,851 --> 01:09:52,856
(Relaxing music)

761
01:10:11,475 --> 01:10:12,809
Show me your star-face.

762
01:10:12,842 --> 01:10:14,711
Do you, do you love me?

763
01:10:14,744 --> 01:10:15,912
[Murphy] I love you.

764
01:10:16,813 --> 01:10:17,747
Hey.

765
01:10:17,781 --> 01:10:20,584
Will you make me look good?

766
01:10:24,854 --> 01:10:27,557
Even when I'm not a good person?

767
01:10:29,626 --> 01:10:30,860
I'm not a good person.

768
01:10:30,894 --> 01:10:31,795
[Murphy] You're not a good
person?

769
01:10:31,828 --> 01:10:34,398
Never, make me look like a
good person.

770
01:10:36,833 --> 01:10:37,767
[Murphy] What?

771
01:10:37,801 --> 01:10:39,503
(Laughing)

772
01:10:39,536 --> 01:10:40,470
Hey.

773
01:10:40,504 --> 01:10:41,771
Play the game!

774
01:10:41,805 --> 01:10:43,440
[Murphy] I'm playing the game!

775
01:10:43,473 --> 01:10:44,908
You're not.

776
01:10:46,876 --> 01:10:47,911
Down and have fun.

777
01:10:47,944 --> 01:10:49,446
That ain't even a question!

778
01:10:49,479 --> 01:10:52,015
You're so stupid, you
just took the last picture

779
01:10:52,048 --> 01:10:53,817
You had in your camera.

780
01:10:53,850 --> 01:10:57,887
I think, I have a few more.

781
01:10:57,921 --> 01:11:01,725
Yeah, so, I think, (mumbling),
romantic.

782
01:11:01,758 --> 01:11:03,560
Do you know what I think about
you?

783
01:11:03,593 --> 01:11:04,661
[Murphy] What?

784
01:11:04,694 --> 01:11:06,830
[Electra] You're an amazing
guy...

785
01:11:07,764 --> 01:11:08,898
[Murphy] But?

786
01:11:09,566 --> 01:11:10,900
[Electra] Oh no but.

787
01:11:11,801 --> 01:11:13,337
You're an amazing guy.

788
01:11:15,071 --> 01:11:16,373
[Murphy] But?

789
01:11:17,641 --> 01:11:20,510
You are one amazing guy.

790
01:11:21,878 --> 01:11:25,281
Who doesn't know what love
means.

791
01:11:25,815 --> 01:11:26,950
Electra?

792
01:11:26,983 --> 01:11:31,755
(Relaxing music)

793
01:11:38,795 --> 01:11:40,430
I'm so glad I met you.

794
01:11:40,464 --> 01:11:45,335
(Relaxing music)

795
01:12:00,984 --> 01:12:02,886
So anyway, Julio...

796
01:12:05,589 --> 01:12:08,792
Listen, I was wondering
if you heard from Electra?

797
01:12:09,559 --> 01:12:12,462
[Voiceover] No, not for a long
time, no,

798
01:12:12,496 --> 01:12:14,664
She kinda disappeared.

799
01:12:15,965 --> 01:12:17,934
And now I'm in rehab.

800
01:12:17,967 --> 01:12:18,935
[Murphy] You're in rehab?

801
01:12:18,968 --> 01:12:21,771
[Voiceover] Yeah, so
I haven't talked to her,

802
01:12:21,805 --> 01:12:22,972
I haven't seen her.

803
01:12:23,006 --> 01:12:25,675
She was hanging out with Farid
and Kemal,

804
01:12:25,709 --> 01:12:28,077
And Farid had problems with the
police.

805
01:12:28,111 --> 01:12:29,112
[Murphy] Yeah.

806
01:12:30,614 --> 01:12:33,917
[Voiceover] But uhm
listen, I'm pretty hungover,

807
01:12:33,950 --> 01:12:36,386
I don't do drugs anymore,
but I got drunk last night,

808
01:12:36,420 --> 01:12:39,155
And I'm not alone, so I'll call
you later.

809
01:12:39,188 --> 01:12:40,089
[Murphy] Okay.

810
01:12:40,123 --> 01:12:43,059
[Voiceover] But hey, stay away
from her.

811
01:12:44,794 --> 01:12:47,130
Thank you, I'm glad to see
you,

812
01:12:47,163 --> 01:12:51,701
And to meet one of your friends,
finally.

813
01:12:54,037 --> 01:12:56,440
So, Murphy,

814
01:12:57,140 --> 01:12:59,409
What are you doing in Paris?

815
01:12:59,843 --> 01:13:01,144
[Murphy] I'm a filmmaker.

816
01:13:02,145 --> 01:13:02,979
Oh.

817
01:13:03,012 --> 01:13:04,514
He's studying.

818
01:13:07,617 --> 01:13:09,586
[Murphy] I'm studying, still
yeah.

819
01:13:09,619 --> 01:13:10,520
Hmm-mm.

820
01:13:10,554 --> 01:13:11,955
So you're an artist?

821
01:13:12,522 --> 01:13:13,122
[Murphy] Exactly.

822
01:13:13,156 --> 01:13:14,624
Like my daughter.

823
01:13:19,729 --> 01:13:21,498
Mama likes art.

824
01:13:21,531 --> 01:13:23,166
Yeah, I do.

825
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:28,738
And how did you meet each other?

826
01:13:28,772 --> 01:13:32,476
In a party, my school party in
a park.

827
01:13:35,712 --> 01:13:37,180
How long ago?

828
01:13:39,483 --> 01:13:40,517
[Murphy] A bit.

829
01:13:42,118 --> 01:13:44,588
Okay, how interesting.

830
01:13:47,190 --> 01:13:50,594
I'll come back in a second,
sorry.

831
01:14:02,906 --> 01:14:05,875
I'd like to ask you a
question.

832
01:14:06,275 --> 01:14:07,443
[Murphy] Sure.

833
01:14:10,146 --> 01:14:13,016
I saw drugs, I think cocaine,

834
01:14:14,083 --> 01:14:16,853
At Electra's apartment.

835
01:14:17,587 --> 01:14:18,121
[Murphy] Really?

836
01:14:18,154 --> 01:14:19,989
I found some, yeah.

837
01:14:21,925 --> 01:14:23,760
[Murphy] But she's
not that kind of girl.

838
01:14:24,260 --> 01:14:26,095
Of course she's not.

839
01:14:26,963 --> 01:14:28,565
Of course not.

840
01:14:28,898 --> 01:14:30,767
That's why I'm asking you.

841
01:14:31,300 --> 01:14:33,102
Do you do drugs?

842
01:14:33,837 --> 01:14:34,538
[Murphy] Me?

843
01:14:34,571 --> 01:14:35,572
Yeah.

844
01:14:36,640 --> 01:14:38,575
[Murphy] No, never.

845
01:14:40,744 --> 01:14:41,845
How did you get it?

846
01:14:41,878 --> 01:14:45,949
(Anticipatory music)
(sniffing)

847
01:14:48,084 --> 01:14:49,252
What?

848
01:14:51,755 --> 01:14:53,122
So I can get some more?

849
01:14:54,190 --> 01:14:55,792
It's not dirty.

850
01:14:56,760 --> 01:14:58,061
Who gave it to you?

851
01:15:01,998 --> 01:15:02,999
Julio.

852
01:15:03,299 --> 01:15:04,200
Julio?

853
01:15:04,834 --> 01:15:05,434
My Julio?

854
01:15:05,468 --> 01:15:07,236
Yeah, your friend Julio.

855
01:15:10,206 --> 01:15:11,575
That's weird.

856
01:15:11,608 --> 01:15:12,676
Why?

857
01:15:12,709 --> 01:15:14,510
How did you get Julio's
number?

858
01:15:18,081 --> 01:15:19,683
I wasn't...

859
01:15:20,283 --> 01:15:22,118
You're paranoid, do you know?

860
01:15:22,151 --> 01:15:23,853
I took it from your phone.

861
01:15:24,588 --> 01:15:25,855
Can we buy some more?

862
01:15:26,189 --> 01:15:27,591
I don't got anymore.

863
01:15:27,891 --> 01:15:28,792
No more coke.

864
01:15:28,825 --> 01:15:29,993
No more coke.

865
01:15:31,861 --> 01:15:34,931
Baby, he's not a drug
dealer, he's our friend.

866
01:15:37,701 --> 01:15:41,037
Do you have, dear friend,

867
01:15:41,070 --> 01:15:43,106
Something else to give us?

868
01:15:43,807 --> 01:15:45,675
I do have something else
actually.

869
01:15:46,676 --> 01:15:47,877
I got some XTC.

870
01:15:47,911 --> 01:15:49,178
That'll do.

871
01:15:49,813 --> 01:15:51,047
Oh, blue.

872
01:15:51,681 --> 01:15:52,749
Two each.

873
01:15:53,116 --> 01:15:53,883
Two each.

874
01:15:53,917 --> 01:15:55,218
Very well, here's two.

875
01:15:59,288 --> 01:16:01,057
What about taking one now?

876
01:16:01,090 --> 01:16:01,825
Hey!

877
01:16:01,858 --> 01:16:03,126
Trust me, will you?

878
01:16:03,159 --> 01:16:04,327
Let's break one and enjoy it.

879
01:16:04,360 --> 01:16:06,229
It is for your own protection.

880
01:16:06,262 --> 01:16:08,732
It is for your own protection?

881
01:16:10,834 --> 01:16:11,935
Now let's see.

882
01:16:13,236 --> 01:16:15,772
You know, my ex-girlfriend,

883
01:16:15,805 --> 01:16:17,707
The shaman, she's been
chilling with the shaman

884
01:16:17,741 --> 01:16:18,942
A lot lately.

885
01:16:20,109 --> 01:16:21,745
She invited us to go on a
spiritual journey with her.

886
01:16:23,112 --> 01:16:24,948
Maybe it's time to purge

887
01:16:25,715 --> 01:16:28,752
The body, cleanse the soul.

888
01:16:30,019 --> 01:16:31,320
Are you asking?

889
01:16:33,322 --> 01:16:35,024
Just don't shit your pants
bro.

890
01:16:36,292 --> 01:16:37,694
You'll be all right.

891
01:16:40,063 --> 01:16:41,698
This is not a drug.

892
01:16:41,731 --> 01:16:44,934
Don't misunderstand me, but,

893
01:16:45,401 --> 01:16:47,170
You have to look further.

894
01:16:47,203 --> 01:16:48,672
This is a...

895
01:16:50,173 --> 01:16:53,309
This is like a head teacher

896
01:16:53,342 --> 01:16:54,944
Showing you the reality,

897
01:16:54,978 --> 01:16:56,946
I mean, what we see is not
the...

898
01:16:57,781 --> 01:16:59,816
Yuyo, hi.

899
01:16:59,849 --> 01:17:00,817
(Speaking French)

900
01:17:00,850 --> 01:17:05,121
(Serene music)

901
01:17:31,214 --> 01:17:32,949
(Puking)

902
01:17:32,982 --> 01:17:34,383
(Groaning)

903
01:17:34,417 --> 01:17:38,855
(Serene music)

904
01:18:02,879 --> 01:18:07,884
(Groaning)

905
01:18:46,189 --> 01:18:50,827
(Melancholic music)

906
01:18:51,460 --> 01:18:53,863
Do you know what my
biggest dream in life is?

907
01:18:54,898 --> 01:18:56,900
My biggest dream is to make a
movie

908
01:18:56,933 --> 01:19:00,403
That truly depicts sentimental
sexuality.

909
01:19:01,370 --> 01:19:03,506
She doesn't care, she has heard
this a million times before.

910
01:19:03,539 --> 01:19:04,774
Yeah I like it.

911
01:19:04,808 --> 01:19:05,141
You like it?

912
01:19:05,174 --> 01:19:06,275
Yeah.

913
01:19:06,309 --> 01:19:08,978
Why, why haven't we seen this
in cinema?

914
01:19:09,012 --> 01:19:11,014
Yeah, right, I agree.

915
01:19:11,047 --> 01:19:12,415
I'm sentimental.

916
01:19:12,448 --> 01:19:14,517
We should birth babies.

917
01:19:14,550 --> 01:19:16,185
Yeah, I agree with you.

918
01:19:16,219 --> 01:19:16,953
Are you an actress?

919
01:19:16,986 --> 01:19:17,486
Yeah.

920
01:19:17,520 --> 01:19:18,321
What's your name?

921
01:19:18,354 --> 01:19:19,022
Paula.

922
01:19:19,055 --> 01:19:19,923
Lola?

923
01:19:19,956 --> 01:19:21,424
Yeah, Paula, I'm French,

924
01:19:21,457 --> 01:19:22,859
But I love to speak English.

925
01:19:22,892 --> 01:19:24,260
Yeah, well it's very good.

926
01:19:24,293 --> 01:19:24,961
Yeah.

927
01:19:24,994 --> 01:19:26,462
What's the best thing in life?

928
01:19:26,495 --> 01:19:27,864
Love.

929
01:19:29,032 --> 01:19:30,133
Love.

930
01:19:30,166 --> 01:19:31,968
And then after that?

931
01:19:32,001 --> 01:19:33,436
Sex! (Laughs)

932
01:19:33,469 --> 01:19:35,371
Yes and then you combine the
two,

933
01:19:35,404 --> 01:19:38,507
And sex while you're in love.

934
01:19:39,075 --> 01:19:39,909
That's the best thing.

935
01:19:39,943 --> 01:19:41,144
I'm sorry, do you have a
cigarette?

936
01:19:41,177 --> 01:19:41,945
I wanna see that!

937
01:19:41,978 --> 01:19:42,511
Yeah.

938
01:19:42,545 --> 01:19:43,412
I want a cigarette.

939
01:19:43,446 --> 01:19:44,447
I don't have one.

940
01:19:44,480 --> 01:19:45,581
No, no, it's cool.

941
01:19:45,614 --> 01:19:46,515
Okay, thank you.

942
01:19:46,549 --> 01:19:48,184
You know, I need to show you
something.

943
01:19:48,217 --> 01:19:49,352
I've gotta show you something.

944
01:19:49,385 --> 01:19:50,519
Okay, sure.

945
01:19:50,553 --> 01:19:52,121
Follow me, follow
me, come, come with me.

946
01:19:52,155 --> 01:19:54,323
Baby, baby I like you.

947
01:19:55,058 --> 01:19:55,925
You're so nice.

948
01:19:55,959 --> 01:20:00,063
(Electronic music)

949
01:20:20,216 --> 01:20:21,350
You look so nice.

950
01:20:21,384 --> 01:20:23,019
That's not coke.

951
01:20:24,553 --> 01:20:25,889
Oh I know.

952
01:20:30,659 --> 01:20:31,961
I have a girlfriend.

953
01:20:31,995 --> 01:20:33,196
Yeah, me too.

954
01:20:34,898 --> 01:20:36,199
You don't have to worry.

955
01:20:37,533 --> 01:20:38,534
You want me?

956
01:20:38,567 --> 01:20:40,003
Can you keep a secret?

957
01:20:40,369 --> 01:20:41,604
I love secrets.

958
01:20:50,446 --> 01:20:51,080
The other way.

959
01:20:51,114 --> 01:20:54,283
(Laughs) Sorry, I'm drunk.

960
01:20:55,284 --> 01:20:59,889
(Soft moaning)

961
01:21:07,663 --> 01:21:09,265
(Door knocking)

962
01:21:16,372 --> 01:21:18,574
(Door knocking)

963
01:21:19,275 --> 01:21:24,047
(Soft moaning)

964
01:21:41,364 --> 01:21:45,268
(Electronic music)

965
01:21:45,301 --> 01:21:49,505
(Music drowns out speech)

966
01:21:56,179 --> 01:21:56,980
Hey.

967
01:21:57,613 --> 01:21:59,082
Don't touch me.

968
01:22:02,351 --> 01:22:03,452
Are you okay?

969
01:22:08,091 --> 01:22:10,326
What the fuck were you
doing with this girl?

970
01:22:10,359 --> 01:22:11,427
She wanted to do coke.

971
01:22:11,460 --> 01:22:13,963
Well what about your fly?

972
01:22:13,997 --> 01:22:14,964
What?

973
01:22:14,998 --> 01:22:16,365
Close your fly.

974
01:22:17,466 --> 01:22:18,534
Oh shit...

975
01:22:18,567 --> 01:22:23,206
(Electronic music)

976
01:22:29,712 --> 01:22:31,414
You know I was knocking.

977
01:22:31,780 --> 01:22:32,715
The music's loud.

978
01:22:32,748 --> 01:22:34,350
Yeah, but not enough

979
01:22:34,383 --> 01:22:38,154
To make me not hear what you
were doing.

980
01:22:38,187 --> 01:22:39,188
What are you talking about?

981
01:22:39,222 --> 01:22:40,389
I hear you!

982
01:22:40,423 --> 01:22:44,127
Ah, okay, what are you talking
about?

983
01:22:46,395 --> 01:22:47,563
You were fucking another girl.

984
01:22:47,596 --> 01:22:49,132
No, I wasn't, no.

985
01:22:49,165 --> 01:22:51,034
You just wanted a kiss,

986
01:22:51,067 --> 01:22:53,202
As every fucking man said.

987
01:22:56,305 --> 01:22:58,541
I cheated on you with Noe.

988
01:22:59,375 --> 01:23:00,309
What?

989
01:23:01,610 --> 01:23:02,711
What?

990
01:23:03,379 --> 01:23:04,047
I cheat...

991
01:23:04,080 --> 01:23:05,048
With who?

992
01:23:05,548 --> 01:23:07,183
With Noe.

993
01:23:07,216 --> 01:23:09,685
With Noe, when?

994
01:23:12,788 --> 01:23:14,423
When were you planning on
telling me this?

995
01:23:14,457 --> 01:23:15,758
I didn't want to tell
you this because I...

996
01:23:15,791 --> 01:23:16,859
That's not what I asked you,

997
01:23:16,892 --> 01:23:18,661
I said, when were you
planning on telling me this?

998
01:23:18,694 --> 01:23:20,229
I was afraid that you would...

999
01:23:20,696 --> 01:23:21,630
Please stop.

1000
01:23:21,664 --> 01:23:22,631
I told you!

1001
01:23:22,665 --> 01:23:23,799
Would you then reveal to me that

1002
01:23:23,832 --> 01:23:26,335
You were fucking your
ex-boyfriend.

1003
01:23:26,369 --> 01:23:27,403
It's your fault!

1004
01:23:27,436 --> 01:23:29,038
It's my fault, how so?

1005
01:23:29,072 --> 01:23:30,106
It's your fucking fault!

1006
01:23:30,139 --> 01:23:31,707
Please explain to me,
because I fucking seeing,

1007
01:23:31,740 --> 01:23:34,677
I'm so stupid that I...

1008
01:23:34,710 --> 01:23:39,448
(Speaking French)

1009
01:23:40,249 --> 01:23:41,517
That I actually believed
that you were anything

1010
01:23:41,550 --> 01:23:43,452
But a fucking whore,
which is what you are.

1011
01:23:43,486 --> 01:23:44,420
You...

1012
01:23:44,453 --> 01:23:45,388
You are not a painter,
you have no talent,

1013
01:23:45,421 --> 01:23:47,723
You will never, ever
sell a fucking painting

1014
01:23:47,756 --> 01:23:50,126
In your whole life, you
are so fucking stupid

1015
01:23:50,159 --> 01:23:52,561
To believe that this piece of
shit

1016
01:23:52,595 --> 01:23:57,300
Will ever sell one of your
worthless pieces of bullshit!

1017
01:23:57,333 --> 01:23:59,735
Believes in my fucking
painting!

1018
01:23:59,768 --> 01:24:01,270
You have no talent!

1019
01:24:01,304 --> 01:24:02,571
And he was nicer than you
anyway!

1020
01:24:02,605 --> 01:24:03,472
You have no talent!

1021
01:24:03,506 --> 01:24:04,373
He was warm!

1022
01:24:04,407 --> 01:24:06,742
I actually like him better
than you,

1023
01:24:06,775 --> 01:24:08,411
Because at least he's honest,

1024
01:24:08,444 --> 01:24:10,546
At least he can do one
thing, which is trick

1025
01:24:10,579 --> 01:24:12,581
A stupid cunt like yourself.

1026
01:24:12,615 --> 01:24:13,849
Ah, so he was like you then!

1027
01:24:13,882 --> 01:24:16,385
You can't even suck a cock
right.

1028
01:24:16,419 --> 01:24:18,487
One of the fucking men
who just wanted to fuck me

1029
01:24:18,521 --> 01:24:20,156
Because I'm pretty.

1030
01:24:20,189 --> 01:24:23,692
And you know what, you will
never, ever,

1031
01:24:23,726 --> 01:24:27,330
Be a good mother, ever!

1032
01:24:27,363 --> 01:24:30,566
You will never be able to mother
a child,

1033
01:24:30,599 --> 01:24:33,202
Because you are a venomous cunt.

1034
01:24:37,273 --> 01:24:40,609
I think we will not
understand each other then.

1035
01:24:47,550 --> 01:24:51,287
(Mumbling) family.

1036
01:24:56,725 --> 01:25:01,630
(Weeping)

1037
01:25:09,772 --> 01:25:13,376
(Mumbling) that exists.

1038
01:25:29,458 --> 01:25:34,297
(Heavy moaning)
(upbeat music)

1039
01:27:16,332 --> 01:27:17,600
This is your dream?

1040
01:27:17,633 --> 01:27:19,735
No this is becoming a fucking
nightmare.

1041
01:27:19,768 --> 01:27:20,903
This is your dream?

1042
01:27:20,936 --> 01:27:23,472
Hey, chill down, you wanted to
come.

1043
01:27:23,506 --> 01:27:24,673
Why didn't you stay at home?

1044
01:27:24,707 --> 01:27:26,342
These bourgeois French fucks.

1045
01:27:26,375 --> 01:27:27,643
Why did you come dressed like
that?

1046
01:27:27,676 --> 01:27:30,779
With their heads so far up
their asses.

1047
01:27:31,480 --> 01:27:32,315
You're being a pain.

1048
01:27:32,348 --> 01:27:33,716
It's nauseating.

1049
01:27:33,749 --> 01:27:35,718
In the fucking ass, control
yourself.

1050
01:27:35,751 --> 01:27:36,585
I wanna vomit.

1051
01:27:36,619 --> 01:27:38,387
Stop drinking, yeah go to the
toilet,

1052
01:27:38,421 --> 01:27:40,656
Go, I'll take a taxi, go home
and sleep.

1053
01:27:40,689 --> 01:27:42,057
I'm having a good time.

1054
01:27:42,090 --> 01:27:43,859
Yeah, (mumbling).

1055
01:27:43,892 --> 01:27:44,927
Where are you going, princess?

1056
01:27:44,960 --> 01:27:45,961
Come on.

1057
01:27:45,994 --> 01:27:46,895
Hey.

1058
01:27:46,929 --> 01:27:48,664
All right, we will go home.

1059
01:27:48,697 --> 01:27:50,399
I'm having a good time.

1060
01:27:50,966 --> 01:27:52,301
Enjoy.

1061
01:27:53,502 --> 01:27:54,670
Enjoy.

1062
01:27:59,508 --> 01:28:00,376
Cognac?

1063
01:28:03,546 --> 01:28:04,947
Hey, hey, hey.

1064
01:28:04,980 --> 01:28:05,981
He looks drunk.

1065
01:28:06,014 --> 01:28:09,518
Please, please, please stop
it.

1066
01:28:09,552 --> 01:28:10,553
Hey come on, let's go home.

1067
01:28:10,586 --> 01:28:11,420
Remember me?

1068
01:28:11,454 --> 01:28:12,588
[Electra] Hey come on.

1069
01:28:12,621 --> 01:28:13,756
Of course I remember you, but,

1070
01:28:13,789 --> 01:28:15,358
You shouldn't drink that much.

1071
01:28:15,391 --> 01:28:17,025
Hey let's go home, let's go
home.

1072
01:28:17,059 --> 01:28:18,594
Who's that?

1073
01:28:18,627 --> 01:28:19,795
Ah, my wife.

1074
01:28:19,828 --> 01:28:21,497
Victoire, nice to meet you.

1075
01:28:21,530 --> 01:28:22,598
Your wife?

1076
01:28:22,631 --> 01:28:23,999
Very nice to meet you.

1077
01:28:24,767 --> 01:28:26,068
Hey, please, please, please
calm down.

1078
01:28:26,101 --> 01:28:27,470
Hey, did you know your husband

1079
01:28:27,503 --> 01:28:28,671
Is fucking my girlfriend?

1080
01:28:28,704 --> 01:28:29,772
It's time to go.

1081
01:28:29,805 --> 01:28:30,839
What?

1082
01:28:30,873 --> 01:28:32,408
What the fuck are you saying?

1083
01:28:32,441 --> 01:28:33,976
Hey please, please...

1084
01:28:34,009 --> 01:28:38,381
(Everyone is talking over each
other)

1085
01:28:39,982 --> 01:28:40,883
(Glass shattering)

1086
01:28:40,916 --> 01:28:45,754
(Upbeat music)

1087
01:28:47,923 --> 01:28:49,925
You piece of shit!

1088
01:28:51,159 --> 01:28:52,561
You American cunt!

1089
01:28:52,595 --> 01:28:56,965
(Upbeat music)

1090
01:29:12,648 --> 01:29:17,420
(Moaning)

1091
01:29:35,804 --> 01:29:37,139
Thank you Electra.

1092
01:30:04,900 --> 01:30:07,102
I'm the victim in this
situation,

1093
01:30:07,135 --> 01:30:09,738
Me, not him.

1094
01:30:09,772 --> 01:30:11,740
He's walking out there
on the street right now

1095
01:30:11,774 --> 01:30:13,175
Laughing about this.

1096
01:30:13,208 --> 01:30:15,544
He's got a cut on his head
yet he's fucked up my life,

1097
01:30:15,578 --> 01:30:17,813
He's fucking up the life of his
wife,

1098
01:30:17,846 --> 01:30:20,483
Of his kids, of me and
my girlfriend and it's...

1099
01:30:20,516 --> 01:30:22,117
Calm down, look,
you're drunk, obviously...

1100
01:30:22,150 --> 01:30:23,986
I'm drunk, yeah, I'm drunk.

1101
01:30:24,019 --> 01:30:26,455
Okay, okay, but that
doesn't change the fact...

1102
01:30:26,489 --> 01:30:28,557
Calm down okay, not that tone.

1103
01:30:28,591 --> 01:30:29,925
What if he was fucking your
girlfriend?

1104
01:30:29,958 --> 01:30:31,594
I'm asking the questions here.

1105
01:30:31,627 --> 01:30:34,162
I'm trying to make you see my
point.

1106
01:30:35,197 --> 01:30:36,965
You don't solve things like
that, okay,

1107
01:30:36,999 --> 01:30:38,100
You beated him.

1108
01:30:38,133 --> 01:30:39,968
I'm proud of what I did.

1109
01:30:40,002 --> 01:30:41,670
You don't have regret?

1110
01:30:41,704 --> 01:30:43,472
I'm proud of what I did.

1111
01:30:46,742 --> 01:30:49,612
Fucking France, 1918 was the
last time

1112
01:30:49,645 --> 01:30:51,480
You guys won a war, since
then what have you done,

1113
01:30:51,514 --> 01:30:53,215
Nothing, you sit on your asses
eating...

1114
01:30:53,248 --> 01:30:55,551
Stop now, okay, stop.

1115
01:30:58,954 --> 01:31:02,024
I'm an American, I'm an
American.

1116
01:31:02,057 --> 01:31:02,925
And what now?

1117
01:31:02,958 --> 01:31:05,894
And we fight for what we
believe in.

1118
01:31:06,929 --> 01:31:09,832
And that guy, that guy
is nothing, he's a rat.

1119
01:31:09,865 --> 01:31:10,966
He's nothing.

1120
01:31:10,999 --> 01:31:12,901
He's less than nothing.

1121
01:31:16,071 --> 01:31:17,706
I liked that cop.

1122
01:31:18,006 --> 01:31:19,775
[Electra] That cop was a pig.

1123
01:31:20,275 --> 01:31:21,376
[Murphy] He understood me.

1124
01:31:21,409 --> 01:31:23,145
[Electra] Why was this
cop, who was asking me again,

1125
01:31:23,178 --> 01:31:25,714
All these questions about my
sexual life?

1126
01:31:25,748 --> 01:31:26,949
[Murphy] 'Cause I'm a man.

1127
01:31:27,650 --> 01:31:28,917
[Electra] You stupid child.

1128
01:31:28,951 --> 01:31:30,052
[Murphy] That's one thing
women don't understand.

1129
01:31:30,085 --> 01:31:32,220
Men understand each other.

1130
01:31:32,254 --> 01:31:34,623
We have respect for one another.

1131
01:31:37,593 --> 01:31:39,895
I was supposed to keep it a
secret but he took my number

1132
01:31:39,928 --> 01:31:42,130
Because he said he
wanted to buy me a drink.

1133
01:31:42,164 --> 01:31:43,966
[Electra] Then go with him.

1134
01:31:44,933 --> 01:31:46,034
[Murphy] Yup.

1135
01:31:46,802 --> 01:31:49,137
What I did was right.

1136
01:31:52,107 --> 01:31:54,276
I protected my woman.

1137
01:31:54,309 --> 01:31:55,878
[Electra] Don't touch me!

1138
01:31:55,911 --> 01:31:59,615
[Murphy] Hey, that's how you
repay me?

1139
01:32:00,315 --> 01:32:02,017
After everything I did for you?

1140
01:32:04,152 --> 01:32:05,588
I was taking care of you.

1141
01:32:05,621 --> 01:32:06,889
Just shut up.

1142
01:32:07,690 --> 01:32:08,757
I don't want to see you anymore.

1143
01:32:08,791 --> 01:32:09,925
[Murphy] Electra.

1144
01:32:10,258 --> 01:32:12,728
That cop agreed with me, you can
ask him.

1145
01:32:14,096 --> 01:32:16,164
Hello, hey, I don't treat you
like a bitch

1146
01:32:16,198 --> 01:32:17,900
Like that fucking gallery owner.

1147
01:32:17,933 --> 01:32:19,234
[Electra] It's over.

1148
01:32:19,702 --> 01:32:20,703
[Murphy] Cunt.

1149
01:32:23,839 --> 01:32:26,909
I'm not a slave to pussy.

1150
01:32:29,945 --> 01:32:32,981
Maybe I should call my little
friend.

1151
01:32:35,884 --> 01:32:37,653
Pussy is pussy.

1152
01:32:40,188 --> 01:32:41,990
I'm just really in my head right
now.

1153
01:32:43,125 --> 01:32:44,192
Okay.

1154
01:32:46,629 --> 01:32:49,164
It's not you, this
doesn't normally happen.

1155
01:32:53,301 --> 01:32:54,269
So?

1156
01:32:55,838 --> 01:32:57,239
Are you sad?

1157
01:33:01,777 --> 01:33:03,746
Your heart is broken?

1158
01:33:04,312 --> 01:33:06,148
No I'm just pissed off.

1159
01:33:07,315 --> 01:33:08,617
Why?

1160
01:33:08,984 --> 01:33:09,718
Why?

1161
01:33:09,752 --> 01:33:10,953
Yes.

1162
01:33:14,156 --> 01:33:16,224
I almost just broke
up with my girlfriend.

1163
01:33:18,026 --> 01:33:19,161
Oh...

1164
01:33:20,796 --> 01:33:22,230
That hurts.

1165
01:33:24,099 --> 01:33:26,802
(Mumbling), you know,

1166
01:33:26,835 --> 01:33:28,871
It's gonna happen a lot of time

1167
01:33:28,904 --> 01:33:30,405
In your life and you're going to
be

1168
01:33:30,438 --> 01:33:32,340
That sad all the time?

1169
01:33:34,009 --> 01:33:37,012
If you fall in love, really,

1170
01:33:37,045 --> 01:33:38,747
You are the loser.

1171
01:33:42,017 --> 01:33:43,185
You understand me?

1172
01:33:45,988 --> 01:33:47,189
I'm the loser?

1173
01:33:47,823 --> 01:33:48,857
Yes.

1174
01:33:51,894 --> 01:33:56,264
(Phone dialing)

1175
01:34:01,837 --> 01:34:02,838
[Voiceover] Hello?

1176
01:34:03,205 --> 01:34:06,308
[Murphy] Hey, hey.

1177
01:34:06,341 --> 01:34:07,810
[Voiceover] Yeah?

1178
01:34:09,044 --> 01:34:10,412
What do you want?

1179
01:34:11,013 --> 01:34:12,180
I'm sleeping.

1180
01:34:12,781 --> 01:34:14,082
[Murphy] Can we meet?

1181
01:34:15,818 --> 01:34:18,220
[Voiceover] I hate you.

1182
01:34:19,354 --> 01:34:20,723
[Murphy] Electra?

1183
01:34:26,995 --> 01:34:31,066
[Voiceover] (sighs) Okay,
let's meet.

1184
01:34:32,334 --> 01:34:33,769
[Murphy] Where are you?

1185
01:34:34,770 --> 01:34:39,775
(Electronic music)

1186
01:35:48,443 --> 01:35:49,211
[Electra] Wait.

1187
01:35:49,244 --> 01:35:54,149
(Electronic music)
(soft moaning)

1188
01:36:47,269 --> 01:36:48,570
That gets me off.

1189
01:36:48,603 --> 01:36:53,441
(Electronic music)
(moaning)

1190
01:37:35,583 --> 01:37:37,953
Maybe one day we can try...

1191
01:37:42,090 --> 01:37:44,226
Love At Eight Months:

1192
01:37:44,993 --> 01:37:46,995
A Pregnant Love Story.

1193
01:37:47,029 --> 01:37:48,931
Fist Made In Germany.

1194
01:37:51,066 --> 01:37:52,567
That's a propaganda film.

1195
01:38:01,676 --> 01:38:05,113
Some people are sick for real.

1196
01:38:05,147 --> 01:38:06,314
Hey...

1197
01:38:09,384 --> 01:38:12,587
These people are unafraid.

1198
01:38:12,620 --> 01:38:17,025
(Electronic music)

1199
01:38:27,269 --> 01:38:29,437
Yeah maybe I just want.

1200
01:38:31,039 --> 01:38:32,640
You can't have that.

1201
01:38:36,744 --> 01:38:41,950
(Upbeat music)
(soft moaning)

1202
01:40:01,529 --> 01:40:03,565
I don't want you to come
back to my police station,

1203
01:40:03,598 --> 01:40:05,533
To my office, because
you beated another guy

1204
01:40:05,567 --> 01:40:06,501
Who looked at your girlfriend.

1205
01:40:06,534 --> 01:40:08,303
[Murphy] No that's
not gonna happen again.

1206
01:40:08,336 --> 01:40:11,573
Yeah but for that you
need to free yourself

1207
01:40:11,606 --> 01:40:15,177
From that feeling, you
need to forget about that.

1208
01:40:15,777 --> 01:40:16,978
You know it's, forget about,

1209
01:40:17,011 --> 01:40:19,781
You are in France here, forget
about your American feeling

1210
01:40:19,814 --> 01:40:23,251
Of possession, of ownership, of
war,

1211
01:40:23,285 --> 01:40:24,519
Of violence.

1212
01:40:25,720 --> 01:40:27,789
Try to think differently, in
the United States in the 60s

1213
01:40:27,822 --> 01:40:30,525
You were different, people
were loving each other.

1214
01:40:31,259 --> 01:40:32,760
What's wrong about going in the
club,

1215
01:40:32,794 --> 01:40:34,562
Fucking other women, because you
know

1216
01:40:34,596 --> 01:40:35,763
You will fuck other women in
your life,

1217
01:40:35,797 --> 01:40:38,433
But you will fuck other women
in your life in her back.

1218
01:40:38,466 --> 01:40:40,102
Here you do it with her.

1219
01:40:40,135 --> 01:40:43,105
It develops your confidence,
your trust.

1220
01:40:43,138 --> 01:40:45,473
I'm sure you will like it,
there are gorgeous women,

1221
01:40:45,507 --> 01:40:48,110
Beautiful women, it's clean,
it's nice,

1222
01:40:48,143 --> 01:40:51,313
There is music, it's even
nicer than a normal club,

1223
01:40:51,346 --> 01:40:53,548
Don't think about it like filthy
club

1224
01:40:53,581 --> 01:40:56,418
Or something like that,
it's beautiful it's clean.

1225
01:40:56,451 --> 01:40:57,685
[Murphy] You go every week or
what?

1226
01:40:57,719 --> 01:41:01,189
Oh we go often, not
every week, often, yeah.

1227
01:41:01,223 --> 01:41:04,326
And I live my sexuality in a
good way,

1228
01:41:04,359 --> 01:41:06,861
I feel relaxed, calm, balanced,

1229
01:41:06,894 --> 01:41:09,697
I don't have the feeling you
have, I don't beat people,

1230
01:41:09,731 --> 01:41:11,499
And that's probably the
most beautiful thing

1231
01:41:11,533 --> 01:41:13,768
You can do with your girlfriend.

1232
01:41:13,801 --> 01:41:15,837
Just to know that she
has some other desire

1233
01:41:15,870 --> 01:41:17,805
And you offer her that desire.

1234
01:41:18,673 --> 01:41:20,675
Bring her, she will enjoy,

1235
01:41:20,708 --> 01:41:22,310
Perhaps she will enjoy watching
you

1236
01:41:22,344 --> 01:41:23,811
Fucking another woman.

1237
01:41:23,845 --> 01:41:26,281
As long as she knows
you come back with her.

1238
01:41:28,350 --> 01:41:29,617
We go often.

1239
01:41:30,352 --> 01:41:32,687
And we're cool, look we are
friends.

1240
01:41:33,488 --> 01:41:34,822
[Murphy] When's the best time
to go?

1241
01:41:34,856 --> 01:41:36,391
Ah Friday, Saturday.

1242
01:41:36,791 --> 01:41:37,625
The weekend.

1243
01:41:37,659 --> 01:41:38,793
The weekend you have plenty of
people,

1244
01:41:38,826 --> 01:41:41,629
So plenty of choice, you can
pick up the one you want,

1245
01:41:41,663 --> 01:41:43,798
Or you can watch, I love
watching.

1246
01:41:43,831 --> 01:41:48,736
(Deep electronic music)
(moaning)

1247
01:42:57,905 --> 01:43:02,844
(Heavy moaning)
(deep electronic music)

1248
01:45:09,837 --> 01:45:11,506
You loved it, you were in
heaven,

1249
01:45:11,539 --> 01:45:13,475
I look over and you're
jerking some French retard's

1250
01:45:13,508 --> 01:45:14,842
Cock off.

1251
01:45:14,876 --> 01:45:16,911
You were so sad there,
fucking all the girls.

1252
01:45:16,944 --> 01:45:17,912
Right in my face.

1253
01:45:17,945 --> 01:45:19,714
All the girls, you were
fucking another girl!

1254
01:45:19,747 --> 01:45:21,115
You wanted me to fuck her!

1255
01:45:21,148 --> 01:45:23,084
Oh so it's just something
what I wanted now?

1256
01:45:24,886 --> 01:45:25,820
No.

1257
01:45:27,054 --> 01:45:27,555
I don't even know why you let
me bring us to this fucking

1258
01:45:27,589 --> 01:45:29,391
Place to begin with.

1259
01:45:30,958 --> 01:45:32,560
You wanted to go there, and we
said

1260
01:45:32,594 --> 01:45:34,396
We would have to try everything
together.

1261
01:45:34,429 --> 01:45:35,463
Well I'm a fucking bonehead
okay,

1262
01:45:35,497 --> 01:45:38,332
So don't let me be so
stupid next time, please.

1263
01:45:38,966 --> 01:45:40,668
You fuck two girl at the same
time,

1264
01:45:40,702 --> 01:45:42,770
I want to fuck two guy at the
same time.

1265
01:45:43,137 --> 01:45:43,805
No.

1266
01:45:43,838 --> 01:45:45,039
If you want you can join us.

1267
01:45:45,072 --> 01:45:46,408
If I want I can join you.

1268
01:45:46,441 --> 01:45:47,375
Yeah.

1269
01:45:49,711 --> 01:45:51,112
You live in fear.

1270
01:46:00,655 --> 01:46:02,457
What about a tranny?

1271
01:46:03,991 --> 01:46:05,727
You wanna fuck a tranny?

1272
01:46:06,428 --> 01:46:08,362
It would be a good compromise.

1273
01:46:09,997 --> 01:46:12,366
Some boobs, some cocks.

1274
01:46:13,000 --> 01:46:14,869
You're fucking crazy.

1275
01:46:15,570 --> 01:46:16,804
What about you?

1276
01:46:23,878 --> 01:46:25,480
Hey baby.

1277
01:46:26,981 --> 01:46:29,984
Mommy has some

1278
01:46:30,017 --> 01:46:33,020
Warm milk

1279
01:46:34,789 --> 01:46:36,558
For you.

1280
01:46:54,241 --> 01:46:55,610
Look.

1281
01:47:00,682 --> 01:47:01,916
Look.

1282
01:47:03,751 --> 01:47:05,186
Come on.

1283
01:47:05,219 --> 01:47:08,590
Come on, don't be afraid.

1284
01:47:09,791 --> 01:47:10,758
Don't be afraid.

1285
01:47:10,792 --> 01:47:11,659
No I can't, I can't.

1286
01:47:11,693 --> 01:47:13,160
Feel it, you saw.

1287
01:47:13,194 --> 01:47:14,796
I thought I could, I can't, I
can't,

1288
01:47:14,829 --> 01:47:15,830
I'm sorry.

1289
01:47:15,863 --> 01:47:16,864
Feel it.

1290
01:47:16,898 --> 01:47:19,000
No I'm sorry I can't, no, no,
no.

1291
01:47:19,033 --> 01:47:20,968
No, no, no, I can't, I can't,

1292
01:47:21,002 --> 01:47:23,938
I can't, I can't, I can't, I
can't.

1293
01:47:24,806 --> 01:47:26,608
I'm never gonna get another
boner.

1294
01:47:26,641 --> 01:47:27,709
I'm sorry...

1295
01:47:27,742 --> 01:47:29,944
[Prostitute] So, what is the
problem?

1296
01:47:29,977 --> 01:47:31,078
I'm sorry.

1297
01:47:31,112 --> 01:47:33,715
[Prostitute] What I'm
sorry, how come you're sorry?

1298
01:47:33,748 --> 01:47:35,983
Relax babe, there's no problem.

1299
01:47:37,785 --> 01:47:42,056
(Moaning)

1300
01:47:42,690 --> 01:47:44,125
I want you.

1301
01:47:52,700 --> 01:47:54,936
I want sex with you.

1302
01:48:01,643 --> 01:48:03,645
[Murphy] I think I had a
blackout.

1303
01:48:09,083 --> 01:48:10,484
[Electra] Don't worry.

1304
01:48:12,687 --> 01:48:13,988
Don't worry.

1305
01:48:15,256 --> 01:48:17,725
What doesn't kill you makes you
stronger.

1306
01:48:23,998 --> 01:48:26,868
[Murphy] I wish I could
erase that thing from my mind.

1307
01:48:36,778 --> 01:48:38,880
[Electra] Don't make such a
big drama.

1308
01:48:47,154 --> 01:48:48,623
[Murphy] Promise me

1309
01:48:49,724 --> 01:48:52,927
That you will never
tell anyone about this.

1310
01:48:53,895 --> 01:48:55,863
[Electra] There is nothing to
hide.

1311
01:48:56,698 --> 01:48:58,766
You can just say it to Julio.

1312
01:49:00,602 --> 01:49:02,536
[Murphy] Secrets make you
stronger.

1313
01:49:04,171 --> 01:49:05,106
[Electra] No.

1314
01:49:06,941 --> 01:49:09,043
Secrets make you darker.

1315
01:49:15,216 --> 01:49:16,751
You know what?

1316
01:49:17,752 --> 01:49:19,220
If we had to break up,

1317
01:49:19,887 --> 01:49:21,923
I would probably disappear.

1318
01:49:27,361 --> 01:49:29,330
[Murphy] How many guys have
you left?

1319
01:49:31,398 --> 01:49:33,234
This is not the point.

1320
01:49:39,841 --> 01:49:42,877
The guy I left, I wasn't in
love.

1321
01:49:55,690 --> 01:49:59,761
Let's try to protect each other.

1322
01:50:08,770 --> 01:50:10,037
I love you.

1323
01:50:11,138 --> 01:50:12,674
I love you too.

1324
01:50:29,957 --> 01:50:32,827
I'm not painting and
you're not doing your stuff.

1325
01:50:37,364 --> 01:50:41,903
We are taking so much drugs,
fighting.

1326
01:50:45,873 --> 01:50:47,842
Yeah and it's raining.

1327
01:50:47,875 --> 01:50:49,677
And it's cold.

1328
01:50:50,377 --> 01:50:53,915
And maybe we're not

1329
01:50:53,948 --> 01:50:57,719
The great artists that we
dreamed we were.

1330
01:51:01,923 --> 01:51:05,326
Maybe this is

1331
01:51:05,359 --> 01:51:07,094
All just shit.

1332
01:51:10,832 --> 01:51:13,735
Maybe I should sleep in
my place for a little while.

1333
01:51:22,509 --> 01:51:25,112
Yeah, maybe that's a good
idea.

1334
01:51:34,355 --> 01:51:37,859
I feel we are losing time
and...

1335
01:51:43,464 --> 01:51:46,300
I'm not always a good influence
for you

1336
01:51:46,333 --> 01:51:49,370
And you are not even a real good

1337
01:51:49,403 --> 01:51:51,138
Influence for me.

1338
01:51:53,374 --> 01:51:55,442
Yeah maybe we should take a
break.

1339
01:52:13,795 --> 01:52:15,897
You know sometimes I miss your
ponytail.

1340
01:52:18,933 --> 01:52:22,069
Sometimes I miss to laugh.

1341
01:52:29,010 --> 01:52:31,112
You were so joyful.

1342
01:52:33,147 --> 01:52:34,515
When we met.

1343
01:52:38,319 --> 01:52:40,221
When we first met?

1344
01:52:52,599 --> 01:52:54,401
At the park?

1345
01:52:57,471 --> 01:52:59,173
No I mean also later.

1346
01:52:59,206 --> 01:53:01,175
It seems like a long time ago.

1347
01:53:12,053 --> 01:53:14,088
And you weren't wearing these.

1348
01:53:18,092 --> 01:53:22,997
(Calming, melancholic music)

1349
01:53:27,134 --> 01:53:27,601
Hi.

1350
01:53:27,634 --> 01:53:28,569
Hey.

1351
01:53:29,871 --> 01:53:31,238
You having a good time?

1352
01:53:32,406 --> 01:53:34,575
Yeah, this is my favorite
park.

1353
01:53:35,176 --> 01:53:36,143
Cool.

1354
01:53:37,078 --> 01:53:38,279
But I have to go.

1355
01:53:38,312 --> 01:53:39,280
Yeah?

1356
01:53:39,313 --> 01:53:40,314
Yeah.

1357
01:53:40,915 --> 01:53:42,216
I'll walk with you.

1358
01:53:44,151 --> 01:53:45,219
No I'm fine.

1359
01:53:45,252 --> 01:53:46,520
No really I'll walk with you,

1360
01:53:46,553 --> 01:53:49,290
It'll be more fun, it'll be
nice.

1361
01:53:53,227 --> 01:53:55,229
Anyway, you have to be careful,

1362
01:53:55,262 --> 01:53:57,999
Because Paris is a really
dangerous city

1363
01:53:58,032 --> 01:54:00,034
With all the foreigners around.

1364
01:54:00,067 --> 01:54:02,036
(Giggling)

1365
01:54:02,069 --> 01:54:03,470
Where do you come from?

1366
01:54:03,504 --> 01:54:04,838
America.

1367
01:54:11,012 --> 01:54:12,113
You?

1368
01:54:15,149 --> 01:54:17,618
I'm from everywhere.

1369
01:54:18,219 --> 01:54:19,120
Oh one sec, Julio!

1370
01:54:19,153 --> 01:54:20,121
What's up, where you going?

1371
01:54:20,154 --> 01:54:21,122
Oh uhm, I'll be right back,

1372
01:54:21,155 --> 01:54:22,489
I'll catch you later.

1373
01:54:29,630 --> 01:54:31,132
From everywhere?

1374
01:54:32,199 --> 01:54:34,501
I mean I'm, my blood is,

1375
01:54:34,535 --> 01:54:35,636
Is mixed.

1376
01:54:39,373 --> 01:54:42,476
Celine, I will call you, bye.

1377
01:54:49,016 --> 01:54:50,251
They are my schoolmates.

1378
01:54:50,284 --> 01:54:50,884
Yeah?

1379
01:54:50,918 --> 01:54:53,487
I'm going to art school.

1380
01:54:53,520 --> 01:54:55,022
Oh cool.

1381
01:54:55,689 --> 01:54:59,126
(Speaking French)

1382
01:55:02,063 --> 01:55:03,965
And what do you do in Paris?

1383
01:55:05,199 --> 01:55:06,667
I'm in film school.

1384
01:55:10,237 --> 01:55:11,305
Are you in love?

1385
01:55:13,507 --> 01:55:14,675
I have someone.

1386
01:55:17,444 --> 01:55:18,379
Well of course you do,

1387
01:55:18,412 --> 01:55:20,147
All the best girls have someone,

1388
01:55:20,181 --> 01:55:21,615
But they're not all happy.

1389
01:55:21,648 --> 01:55:23,417
(Giggling)

1390
01:55:26,687 --> 01:55:28,956
But you didn't say you
were in love with him.

1391
01:55:32,994 --> 01:55:34,561
I don't know anything about
love,

1392
01:55:34,595 --> 01:55:36,263
But in my mind it's like a place

1393
01:55:36,297 --> 01:55:37,731
You don't want to live.

1394
01:55:37,764 --> 01:55:38,532
Okay?

1395
01:55:38,565 --> 01:55:39,633
It would be something like
a...

1396
01:55:39,666 --> 01:55:41,368
Okay, so you've been in love,

1397
01:55:41,402 --> 01:55:42,236
You know what it feels like,

1398
01:55:42,269 --> 01:55:44,405
But you're no longer there, you
left?

1399
01:55:47,308 --> 01:55:48,242
Well I mean,

1400
01:55:48,275 --> 01:55:50,344
It happened that we
wound up in a situation

1401
01:55:50,377 --> 01:55:52,679
Where you feel a lot of love
around you.

1402
01:55:53,314 --> 01:55:55,316
Not only like in a relationship,

1403
01:55:55,349 --> 01:55:56,683
I mean love is,

1404
01:55:57,418 --> 01:56:00,087
No, love is life,

1405
01:56:00,121 --> 01:56:01,255
Love is life.

1406
01:56:01,288 --> 01:56:02,223
Hey, no that way!

1407
01:56:02,256 --> 01:56:02,990
This way?

1408
01:56:03,024 --> 01:56:03,424
[Electra] Yeah.

1409
01:56:03,457 --> 01:56:04,358
Sorry.

1410
01:56:04,391 --> 01:56:05,526
Sorry.

1411
01:56:06,127 --> 01:56:08,462
It makes people brag.

1412
01:56:09,596 --> 01:56:10,597
Yeah it makes people brag,

1413
01:56:10,631 --> 01:56:12,233
Also it drives people crazy.

1414
01:56:12,633 --> 01:56:15,169
A young person without love is
like,

1415
01:56:16,637 --> 01:56:18,739
Like a sparrow without air.

1416
01:56:18,772 --> 01:56:20,507
(Giggling)

1417
01:56:20,541 --> 01:56:22,609
Oh you didn't know you could
fly, did you?

1418
01:56:23,310 --> 01:56:24,778
That's what I want to do.

1419
01:56:24,811 --> 01:56:27,281
It's true, you think I'm
joking?

1420
01:56:27,314 --> 01:56:30,717
I'm serious, I'm fucking serious
like now.

1421
01:56:32,619 --> 01:56:34,288
Look we live one life.

1422
01:56:34,721 --> 01:56:37,358
When we're born, we know we're
gonna die.

1423
01:56:38,259 --> 01:56:39,093
And so what's the point,

1424
01:56:39,126 --> 01:56:41,228
To keep on fighting?

1425
01:56:42,496 --> 01:56:43,630
For what?

1426
01:56:44,231 --> 01:56:46,267
There's no hope, because,

1427
01:56:46,733 --> 01:56:48,435
We should just commit suicide.

1428
01:56:50,704 --> 01:56:53,240
I don't wanna say goodbye.

1429
01:57:00,547 --> 01:57:01,515
Hey.

1430
01:57:02,583 --> 01:57:04,351
What's the meaning of life?

1431
01:57:05,152 --> 01:57:06,220
Love.

1432
01:57:06,253 --> 01:57:10,691
(Calming, melancholic music)

1433
01:57:27,308 --> 01:57:28,509
What's your name?

1434
01:57:29,643 --> 01:57:32,646
Murphy, what's yours?

1435
01:57:32,679 --> 01:57:33,780
Electra.

1436
01:57:33,814 --> 01:57:38,519
(Calming, melancholic music)

1437
01:57:41,788 --> 01:57:46,593
(Soft moaning)

1438
01:58:52,659 --> 01:58:55,596
I wanna fuck you so much.

1439
01:59:01,368 --> 01:59:03,704
So much...

1440
01:59:06,473 --> 01:59:11,445
(Calming, melancholic music)
(moaning)

1441
02:00:16,543 --> 02:00:18,512
Will you promise me something?

1442
02:00:25,919 --> 02:00:27,488
No matter what,

1443
02:00:29,956 --> 02:00:31,725
We will protect each other,

1444
02:00:32,926 --> 02:00:34,528
From anyone,

1445
02:00:35,629 --> 02:00:37,898
That will ever stand between us.

1446
02:00:43,637 --> 02:00:44,871
I promise.

1447
02:00:48,809 --> 02:00:50,544
I promise too.

1448
02:00:50,577 --> 02:00:54,915
(Calming music)

1449
02:01:19,840 --> 02:01:21,775
Are you afraid of death?

1450
02:01:22,643 --> 02:01:24,445
I'm afraid of pain.

1451
02:01:26,012 --> 02:01:28,415
I don't wanna die in pain.

1452
02:01:32,986 --> 02:01:34,355
I'd rather

1453
02:01:36,357 --> 02:01:38,058
Commit suicide.

1454
02:01:42,829 --> 02:01:46,500
[Voiceover] Please, please,
please,

1455
02:01:47,534 --> 02:01:48,635
God,

1456
02:01:51,405 --> 02:01:53,407
Tell me she's okay.

1457
02:01:54,808 --> 02:01:57,644
I don't want anything
bad to happen to her.

1458
02:02:00,113 --> 02:02:01,882
Just tell me she's okay.

1459
02:02:01,915 --> 02:02:05,686
(Phone dialing)

1460
02:02:05,719 --> 02:02:07,120
Tell me she's happy.

1461
02:02:07,153 --> 02:02:11,091
[Voiceover] (speaking French).

1462
02:02:11,124 --> 02:02:12,993
[Voiceover] Tell me she's
alive.

1463
02:02:13,026 --> 02:02:16,930
[Voiceover] (speaking French).

1464
02:02:25,772 --> 02:02:29,943
[Voiceover] No, please, God.

1465
02:02:31,111 --> 02:02:33,514
Tell me this isn't true.

1466
02:02:35,516 --> 02:02:37,951
No, no, no...

1467
02:02:39,420 --> 02:02:41,422
I wanna go back.

1468
02:02:42,989 --> 02:02:45,992
I wanna go back to the first
night.

1469
02:02:47,661 --> 02:02:49,663
I wanna wake up with her.

1470
02:02:52,866 --> 02:02:54,835
Grant me this one wish.

1471
02:02:57,471 --> 02:02:59,506
Please let me do that.

1472
02:03:01,141 --> 02:03:03,610
And I swear I'll live a good
life.

1473
02:03:04,911 --> 02:03:07,514
I swear, I swear to you.

1474
02:03:07,548 --> 02:03:11,718
(Melancholic, calming music)

1475
02:03:11,752 --> 02:03:15,088
(Mumbling) a place that
(mumbling).

1476
02:03:20,594 --> 02:03:22,596
[Voiceover] I swear that this
is ours.

1477
02:03:27,734 --> 02:03:29,736
Life is what you make of it.

1478
02:03:30,837 --> 02:03:32,506
[Voiceover] I'll be good.

1479
02:03:34,140 --> 02:03:35,576
Like a dream.

1480
02:03:36,477 --> 02:03:37,911
[Voiceover] I'll be true.

1481
02:03:39,179 --> 02:03:40,747
I like you.

1482
02:03:42,583 --> 02:03:43,984
I like you too.

1483
02:03:47,253 --> 02:03:49,155
[Voiceover] Electra I love
you.

1484
02:03:53,960 --> 02:03:55,996
There's nothing after death,

1485
02:03:56,797 --> 02:03:57,931
Nothing,

1486
02:03:58,765 --> 02:03:59,900
Nothing at all.

1487
02:03:59,933 --> 02:04:04,104
(Melancholic, calming music)

1488
02:05:05,999 --> 02:05:08,635
Did you come inside me?

1489
02:05:17,010 --> 02:05:21,815
(Serene music)

1490
02:05:58,351 --> 02:05:59,953
When you die.

1491
02:06:01,121 --> 02:06:03,289
You die with your memories.

1492
02:06:05,258 --> 02:06:09,630
Murphy, I love you

1493
02:06:10,263 --> 02:06:11,765
So much.

1494
02:06:13,934 --> 02:06:15,736
If one day I die,

1495
02:06:16,302 --> 02:06:18,204
I would love to know,

1496
02:06:18,238 --> 02:06:20,306
That you fall in love

1497
02:06:21,642 --> 02:06:24,210
Again, and again,

1498
02:06:25,946 --> 02:06:27,113
And again.

1499
02:06:27,147 --> 02:06:31,952
(Serene music)

1500
02:07:30,977 --> 02:07:35,749
(Crying)

1501
02:07:51,798 --> 02:07:53,967
(Door opening)

1502
02:08:02,408 --> 02:08:03,744
[Gaspar] Dad?

1503
02:08:12,853 --> 02:08:14,187
Come here.

1504
02:08:15,321 --> 02:08:16,389
Huh?

1505
02:08:17,290 --> 02:08:18,959
[Murphy] Come to Daddy.

1506
02:08:22,763 --> 02:08:23,897
[Gaspar] Huh?

1507
02:08:29,970 --> 02:08:34,975
(Crying)

1508
02:08:54,394 --> 02:08:57,163
Gaspar, I'm so sorry.

1509
02:09:03,003 --> 02:09:05,238
Life is not easy.

1510
02:09:07,841 --> 02:09:10,110
Some day you will understand.

1511
02:09:10,143 --> 02:09:14,848
(Crying)

1512
02:09:15,548 --> 02:09:17,350
Please forgive me.

1513
02:09:19,886 --> 02:09:21,754
I am lost.

1514
02:09:33,233 --> 02:09:38,038
(Relaxing, melancholic music)

1515
02:10:46,172 --> 02:10:47,440
Please.

1516
02:10:49,275 --> 02:10:51,244
Don't you ever leave me.

1517
02:10:58,952 --> 02:11:00,520
[Murphy] I promise,

1518
02:11:02,455 --> 02:11:05,225
I will love you till the end.

1519
02:11:43,964 --> 02:11:48,969
(Melancholic piano music)
