1
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:19,042
**Of all the wonderful things
in life you can find**

2
00:00:19,270 --> 00:00:22,000
**They all can be yours
with the right frame of mind**

3
00:00:22,196 --> 00:00:25,296
**Just look and you'll find
No run, no lie**

4
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:28,500
**There are no secrets to hide
No run, no lie**

5
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:32,000
**Leave your problems behind
Leave your problems behind**

6
00:00:32,135 --> 00:00:34,380
**No worry, friends
No worry**

7
00:00:45,629 --> 00:00:47,506
Yuck!

8
00:00:47,589 --> 00:00:49,633
Eww!

9
00:00:49,716 --> 00:00:51,343
Swim trunks are loaded
with detergents...

10
00:00:51,426 --> 00:00:53,428
and other hazardous chemicals
that could be harmful to fish.

11
00:00:53,512 --> 00:00:55,264
Ow! Ah!

12
00:01:36,054 --> 00:01:37,472
Hi, Allison.

13
00:01:44,188 --> 00:01:46,106
-Just quit my job at the aquarium.
- Heard you got fired.

14
00:01:47,482 --> 00:01:49,700
Yeah. Aquarium's totally changed,
but don't worry about me.

15
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:52,321
I'll be fine. You know,
I got a lot of great offers.

16
00:01:52,988 --> 00:01:54,907
You know, things are really
starting to happen for me.

17
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:56,491
- I was thinking, maybe later,
if you weren't doing..
- No.

18
00:01:57,993 --> 00:01:59,661
I mean, uh, if you're..
when you're not workin'..

19
00:01:59,995 --> 00:02:00,954
I don't think so.

20
00:02:02,998 --> 00:02:05,542
Okay, I guess I'll just, you know,
take some sea snails and be on my way.

21
00:02:13,008 --> 00:02:15,636
No, no, a little lower.
The ones on the bottom.

22
00:02:34,404 --> 00:02:36,865
Uh.. Have a good nipple.

23
00:03:03,016 --> 00:03:05,978
**Colour me your colour, baby**

24
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,313
**Colour me your car**

25
00:03:09,815 --> 00:03:12,526
**Colour me your colour, darling**

26
00:03:13,318 --> 00:03:14,862
**I know who you are**

27
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:20,409
**Come up off your colour chart**
- Ah, you have beautiful skin, baby.

28
00:03:21,493 --> 00:03:23,495
Get some olive oil,
rub it all over you.

29
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:30,002
- Oh, yeah?
- Oh, yeah.

30
00:03:33,005 --> 00:03:34,200
Let's get him out of there.

31
00:03:47,019 --> 00:03:49,730
Oh! Oh, Antoine! Yeah!

32
00:04:02,993 --> 00:04:03,994
Yes!

33
00:04:08,499 --> 00:04:10,209
Try to keep your goldfish
in this bowl.

34
00:04:14,004 --> 00:04:15,589
If you like, I could
stick around for a while.

35
00:04:18,008 --> 00:04:19,009
Every kid needs a father.

36
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:33,398
What the hell?

37
00:04:53,001 --> 00:04:53,836
What the hell are you doing?

38
00:04:55,337 --> 00:04:56,630
There's a mongrel koi in there.

39
00:04:57,005 --> 00:04:58,924
It's the most dangerous
of all goldfish.

40
00:05:01,009 --> 00:05:01,760
Do you have any ice?

41
00:05:03,512 --> 00:05:05,639
Hey! Shoes off, huh?

42
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:08,141
Respect the 18th-century
Persian carpet.

43
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:14,815
Whoa! What are those?

44
00:05:15,858 --> 00:05:17,985
Medieval weapons.
I'm a collector.

45
00:05:19,987 --> 00:05:21,864
They're worth twice as much
If they've killed somebody.

46
00:05:26,201 --> 00:05:27,578
I collect Canadian quarters.

47
00:05:28,704 --> 00:05:29,663
I got about six of them.

48
00:05:35,502 --> 00:05:36,753
Would you like anything to drink?

49
00:05:38,213 --> 00:05:39,381
I wouldn't mind a glass of..

50
00:05:40,007 --> 00:05:42,176
Whoa. What is that?

51
00:05:43,302 --> 00:05:46,180
Is that a custom Living Colour,
anti-glare, retractable-top tank?

52
00:05:46,722 --> 00:05:48,682
- I'm not sure.
- It is.

53
00:05:50,017 --> 00:05:51,310
They assemble
each one of these by hand.

54
00:05:52,102 --> 00:05:55,314
Whoa. Chinese tail bar lionfish.
He's a beauty.

55
00:05:55,981 --> 00:05:57,191
That's an $800 fish!

56
00:05:58,609 --> 00:06:01,361
- Try a grand.
- Well, then you overpaid.

57
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:07,409
Hey, fishy, fishy, fishy, fishy.

58
00:06:07,784 --> 00:06:09,119
Hey, fishy, fishy, fishy.

59
00:06:09,995 --> 00:06:11,997
Hey, an Australian rainbow fish.

60
00:06:12,998 --> 00:06:14,291
You're not gonna wanna
put him in there.

61
00:06:16,335 --> 00:06:18,629
- Oh, God!
- Women love it.

62
00:06:19,713 --> 00:06:21,798
They find it erotic
when they eat each other.

63
00:06:24,092 --> 00:06:25,344
Excuse me for a second, huh?

64
00:06:26,094 --> 00:06:26,845
Must make pee-pee.

65
00:06:42,486 --> 00:06:46,156
Antoine, hi. It's Regina. I'm flying in
from Luxembourg tomorrow.

66
00:06:46,281 --> 00:06:49,076
I want you to be my driver.
SwissAir, flight 12.

67
00:06:49,284 --> 00:06:52,037
Is it still 3,500?
See you. Ciao.

68
00:06:54,998 --> 00:06:57,209
I finally figured out how you
pick up all these gorgeous women.

69
00:06:58,001 --> 00:07:00,546
- How's that?
- You're a limo driver.

70
00:07:02,005 --> 00:07:02,923
Sometimes I am.

71
00:07:04,466 --> 00:07:06,009
So you just drive them back here
and have sex with them?

72
00:07:06,927 --> 00:07:08,303
If they pay me enough, yes.

73
00:07:09,179 --> 00:07:10,556
What kind of limo service is that?

74
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:14,357
Shouldn't you be taking them
to fancy restaurants or the theatre?

75
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:19,037
- I'm a gigolo.
- A gigo-who?

76
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:23,362
Women pay me
to give them pleasure.

77
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,415
How'd you get that job?

78
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:31,926
I just kind of fell into it.

79
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:35,630
I'm gonna kill
my guidance counsellor.

80
00:07:44,174 --> 00:07:45,390
Hey! Hey! Hey!

81
00:07:56,171 --> 00:07:58,940
Down! Bad dog!

82
00:08:06,632 --> 00:08:08,950
Hey, guys.
Did you miss me?

83
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:19,562
Well, there's been a slight delay
in our move-to-the-beach plan.

84
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:23,200
But don't worry.

85
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,389
It's gonna happen.

86
00:08:34,565 --> 00:08:36,374
Hey, fish guy!

87
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:40,835
I think there's something wrong
with my, uh...

88
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
uh, duh, duh, big fish.

89
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,800
PH is off. The nitrates
are at a dangerous level.

90
00:08:54,936 --> 00:08:56,190
I can neutralize it.

91
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,045
Oh, hey, fishy, fishy, fishy.

92
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:00,886
They don't like that.

93
00:09:04,932 --> 00:09:06,199
I think our little friend
has Malawi bloat.

94
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:09,300
- What the hell is that?
- It's a gill disorder.

95
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:10,871
Is it bad?

96
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,558
- Could be fatal.
- But is he gonna make it?

97
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:18,616
He's in shock. I gave him
some freeze-dried water fleas,
but he's gotta wanna live.

98
00:09:19,018 --> 00:09:21,133
- The next 48 hours are critical.
- Forty-eight hours?

99
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:23,798
But I got to go to Switzerland
for business.

100
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,430
- I'll be gone for three weeks.
- Well, cancel it.

101
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:29,592
- You got a sick fish here, pal.
- Hey, hey, what about you, huh?

102
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:33,000
Sounds good, but I can't afford to go to
Europe right now. My passport expired..

103
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:36,264
No, no. I mean you can stay here
and look after my fish, huh?

104
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:38,463
No, I've got a full bar, huh?

105
00:09:39,026 --> 00:09:42,041
Digital television.
You're on the beach.

106
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,423
I don't know. I..

107
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:53,205
I would be honoured
to care for your fish.

108
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,322
Just remember.

109
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,193
Don't use my car
and don't answer my phone.

110
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,725
No car, no phone.

111
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:17,940
So I guess throwing a big beach party
is out of the question, huh?

112
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:24,443
This is a 14th-century
Hungarian crossbow.

113
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:28,560
It has killed a king
and changed the history of Europe.

114
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,693
You mess up anything
in my apartment...

115
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,760
I'll shove it up your ass.

116
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:37,206
Have a good trip.

117
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,287
**Come on, come on**

118
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,340
Women pay me
to give them pleasure.

119
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,257
**Come on, come on**

120
00:11:03,683 --> 00:11:05,978
**And tell me why you're standing**

121
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,859
**Come on, come on**

122
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:10,863
**It must be
Why you're demanding**

123
00:11:10,999 --> 00:11:12,294
**Come on, come on**

124
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,920
**Come on, come on**

125
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:20,974
**And stop**
- I'm on the beach.

126
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,500
I mean, I open up my window,
I got sand blowin' in my face.

127
00:11:24,056 --> 00:11:26,000
It's that crazy.
I'd love to show it to you sometime.

128
00:11:26,134 --> 00:11:28,000
- No.
- You really owe it yourself to see..

129
00:11:28,105 --> 00:11:29,300
- No.
- Hey!

130
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,996
Try to get laid
on your own time, pal.

131
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:34,967
- Yeah, come on!
- Let's go, pal. Really.

132
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,962
I guess I'll just take
some sea snails.

133
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,262
You better give me some
from the colder tank.

134
00:12:25,493 --> 00:12:26,000
Oh!

135
00:12:28,733 --> 00:12:29,572
Oh! Oh, yes!

136
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,300
Oh!

137
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:34,056
I've been bad.

138
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:35,500
I've been really bad.

139
00:12:35,658 --> 00:12:38,220
Oh! Ah!

140
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,157
But it was worth it.

141
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:45,639
Hi. Would you like to buy
some Girls of America cookies?

142
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,095
- Don't hit me with that.
- Could you come back later?

143
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,429
- Ohh!
- Eww! What are you watching?

144
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:57,352
You're gross! You're a sick man,
and I'm gonna tell!

145
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:59,348
- Hit me with it again!
- How much?

146
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,082
Great.

147
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:13,176
Hey, uh, Deuce, it's Antoine.

148
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,956
I just realized
I don't know you that well.

149
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:18,199
To be honest,
it's freaking me out a little.

150
00:14:18,802 --> 00:14:21,940
You just make sure you keep my apartment
clean, or you will die! Bye-bye.

151
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,767
Six thousand dollars?

152
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:22,345
I know. It sucks.

153
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:27,378
- Neil, where am I gonna get
$6,000 in three weeks?
- I don't know your budget.

154
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,413
You may not want to blow
your whole wad on this tank.

155
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,118
I would.

156
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:38,034
- Can I pay in instalments?
- No.

157
00:15:38,787 --> 00:15:41,598
I'm up to my bicep in it,
If you know what I mean.

158
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:45,511
I'm not trying to flip you over
and do you dry here.

159
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,572
Look. Squat on it for a night,
and let me know.

160
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,042
- What? Hello?
- Hi.

161
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:22,592
I've been staring at your number
For hours. I got it from a friend.

162
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:26,756
Um, I'm not really
supposed to use this phone.

163
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:31,060
Why don't you come over?
My address is 1235 Radford Way.

164
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:36,191
Actually, uh, I've.. I've got
a lot of work to do here still.

165
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,346
I'm naked.

166
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
**Call me
Call me**

167
00:16:41,522 --> 00:16:42,300
**On the line**

168
00:16:42,642 --> 00:16:46,157
**Call me, call me
any, anytime**

169
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:47,380
**Call me**

170
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:58,417
Now there's my little
German tourist.

171
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:02,582
Is this it?
Is this the whole outfit?

172
00:17:03,116 --> 00:17:04,901
It's perfect.

173
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:19,771
Yes. Use the map.
Use the map.

174
00:17:25,448 --> 00:17:29,485
"Vohrest der
Statue of Liberty?"

175
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:32,698
You should have stuck
with the tour, Heinz.

176
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:35,409
Now you'll have to
pay the penalty.

177
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:39,817
It's.. It's no problem.
I'll just, um..

178
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,676
Let me slip on
a few of these babies.

179
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,994
- What was that?
- I didn't hear anything.

180
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:57,914
Now, come here,
you naughty little sightseer.

181
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,500
- Wait a second.
I definitely heard something!
- Oh, that's just Wolfy.

182
00:18:06,743 --> 00:18:10,200
He's been in there a while. Now,
you concentrate and stay in character.

183
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,250
Wolfy, settle down!

184
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,198
Now, you just focus
on your little Wiener schnitzel.

185
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:20,785
I gotta get outta here.

186
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,883
Don't worry. He never
gets all the way through.

187
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,002
Maybe you better go.

188
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,500
Wolfy has got to stop
doing this to Mommy's friends!

189
00:18:32,739 --> 00:18:34,947
Yes, he does.
Yes, he does.

190
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,989
He'll be all right for a while. Here,
this is for you. It's all I could grab.

191
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,552
- Did I bring you pleasure?
- Not really.

192
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:43,986
Y-Y-You better haul ass.

193
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:00,925
Ten dollars?

194
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:05,830
Yeah!

195
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,618
**Well, you can tell
by the way I roll shorty**

196
00:19:17,346 --> 00:19:19,141
**That I'm a ladies' man
A businessman**

197
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:21,000
**I keep it intact
Yo, Clef**

198
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:24,000
**Do the track with John
Play the mack while I pay the taxi**

199
00:19:24,057 --> 00:19:26,283
**Business as usual
watchin' suspects**

200
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:28,597
**Steal my assets**
- Martini and two olives.

201
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,031
**Drink sat the bar**
- Martini. Two olives.

202
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,103
Any ladies need
some entertainment tonight?

203
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:36,680
He's kind of cute.

204
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,929
Eight-fifty.

205
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:53,356
- Eight dollars?
- And fifty cents.

206
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,488
Well, how much just for
a plain cranberry juice?

207
00:19:58,388 --> 00:19:59,214
Oh, uh, three dollars.

208
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:00,784
I'll go for that.

209
00:20:06,063 --> 00:20:08,110
There you go.
That's, uh, eleven-fifty.

210
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,875
Uh, no, no.
Perhaps you misunderstood me.

211
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:15,147
I wish to cancel my original order
Of the martini and two olives...

212
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,357
and go for just the plain cranberry
juice, by itself, for the three dollars.

213
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:22,071
And I apologize for any inconvenience
this may have caused you.

214
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:23,799
Uh, perhaps you don't understand.

215
00:20:24,308 --> 00:20:26,437
Uh, if you don't pay me now,
I'm going to, uh...

216
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:29,213
I'm gonna take this swizzle stick
and, uh...

217
00:20:29,585 --> 00:20:30,937
I'll be shovin' that
right up your pee hole.

218
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,048
**Stayin' alive**
- So that was eleven-fiifty, right?

219
00:20:35,555 --> 00:20:37,006
- Right.
- Okay.

220
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:40,689
There's ten and six quarters.

221
00:20:41,528 --> 00:20:44,109
And, uh, tell you what.
I'll go work on your tip.

222
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:53,578
I couldn't help
overhearing your Spanish.

223
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:55,755
It's French.

224
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,139
French. Nice people.
May l?

225
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:03,000
No..

226
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Oop.

227
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:08,632
These leather seats.

228
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:11,912
Would you like a martini
or cranberry juice?

229
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:12,900
No.

230
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,120
Kinda celebrating tonight.

231
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:19,814
Possible career change.

232
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,904
- I'm pretty excited about it.
- You wanna get outta here?

233
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:31,947
Okay. I'm sorry.

234
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,612
I mean, together.

235
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:47,642
What happened to the carpet?

236
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:51,981
Oh, it's, uh, one of those
18th-century wet rugs.

237
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,113
Oh, that's certainly appreciated.

238
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:05,779
Hey, whoa.

239
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,349
Maybe we should take care
Of a little business first.

240
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:11,734
If you prefer.

241
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,678
I don't have a set price or anything,
but I have been getting ten dollars.

242
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,920
- I'm sorry?
- Well, that's my going rate.

243
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:21,562
But I'm willing to negotiate.

244
00:22:24,509 --> 00:22:27,356
That's funny.
But the price is 500.

245
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,467
You're gonna pay me $500?

246
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:33,860
No, honey, you pay me.

247
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:38,467
Oh, I get it. This is
some kind of role reversal.

248
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:42,000
I'll play along with this.
Okay, 300, 400, 500.

249
00:22:42,732 --> 00:22:43,800
You're my hooker.

250
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:45,787
No, seriously,
where's my ten dollars?

251
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:49,509
Look, asshole, I didn't come
all the way down here for nothin'.

252
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,919
Now, give me my $500!

253
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:56,055
You give me ten dollars!

254
00:22:56,921 --> 00:22:58,261
500, now!

255
00:23:00,786 --> 00:23:02,922
You pay me ten dollars.

256
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,398
Nice. Oh!

257
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,425
Is that all you got?

258
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,436
Ten dollars!

259
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,906
No! Please, don't!

260
00:23:51,556 --> 00:23:53,853
Five hundred dollars,
or the fish gets it.

261
00:23:54,531 --> 00:23:55,342
Let's talk about this.

262
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:08,557
- Why do you have a picture of Antoine?
- Well, this is his place. 
I'm watchin' his fish for him.

263
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:16,427
Please, don't tell him
about the shoes, huh?

264
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:39,581
- Excuse me. Can I help you?
- Oh, my God.

265
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:41,944
I'm lookin' at a dead man.

266
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:46,245
You know, Claire told me
that Antoine's place was messed up...

267
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:49,183
but I had no idea.

268
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:52,152
- Claire?
- The hooker you ass-punched.

269
00:24:52,820 --> 00:24:53,835
That was a misunderstanding...

270
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:58,403
and I intend to have everything fiixed
by the time Antoine gets back.

271
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:02,255
I'm just.. just a little
strapped for cash right now.

272
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:04,645
Maybe there's something
we could work out.

273
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:07,206
Claire mentioned
that you dabbled in harlotry.

274
00:25:08,246 --> 00:25:10,008
- I'm sorry?
- You a man-whore.

275
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:12,490
- Well, I tried that for a couple hours..
- See this ring?

276
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,444
Topaz.
That's my mother's birthstone.

277
00:25:14,959 --> 00:25:15,926
Got that from man-whorin'.

278
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:18,765
See this key chain?
That's right.

279
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:21,850
Mini yo-yo.
Know how I got the money for that?

280
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:23,476
- Man-whorin'?
- Stock market.

281
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,238
But I got the money for the stock market
from man-whorin'...

282
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,716
and representin'
man-whores like yourself.

283
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:34,271
- So, you're a pimp?
- T.J. don't consider himself no pimp.

284
00:25:35,175 --> 00:25:37,021
More of a male madam.

285
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,873
That wasn't too well thought out.

286
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,660
Look at this proud fish.
It's like a coyote. King of the jungle.

287
00:25:46,554 --> 00:25:48,506
Just like Antoine.
He don't need no pimp.

288
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,992
Now look at this
mid-level fish here.

289
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:55,098
Works hotels, conventions,
senior centres.

290
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:58,333
I represent several man-whores
 at this level of the game.

291
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,324
Now look at this little fella.

292
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:05,000
At the bottom, tryin' to get busy
with the scuba man.

293
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:08,806
You know, if you work hard
and listen to me...

294
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,298
this could be you.

295
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:15,495
Well, thanks,
but I already have a job.

296
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:20,337
- I clean fish tanks.
- You ever make $150
cleanin' fish tanks?

297
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:22,383
- A hundred and fiifty dollars?
- Yeah.

298
00:26:22,956 --> 00:26:24,171
Fish ain't gonna pay
for all this.

299
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,027
I don't know.

300
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:31,293
You know, Antoine's
got a bad temper.

301
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,088
Remember once I dropped
a cigar ash on his rug.

302
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:38,204
He made me pick it up
with my anus.

303
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,475
Well, maybe I could
do a couple jobs...

304
00:26:43,994 --> 00:26:45,123
just to get
this place fiixed up.

305
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,424
We got a lot of work to do.

306
00:27:09,112 --> 00:27:11,047
**I believe in miracles**

307
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:13,998
**Where you from**

308
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:17,136
**You sexy thing
Sexy thing, you**

309
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,734
**I believe in miracles**

310
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,625
**Since you came along**

311
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:53,967
You a man-whore now.

312
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:58,038
- I'm so proud.
- Thanks, T.J.

313
00:27:58,959 --> 00:28:00,537
Now, remember, it's business.

314
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,879
Never, ever fall in love.

315
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,643
I'm upstairs!

316
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:49,555
Okay, Deuce,
don't fall in love.

317
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,813
I know what you're thinkin'.

318
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:08,854
You're thinkin' those are
the biggest boobies you've ever seen.

319
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:10,618
Can I please use your phone?

320
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:11,971
I'm not your average woman.

321
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,806
I like sex,
and I'm not afraid to admit..

322
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,380
Excuse me.
I just had pudding an hour ago.

323
00:29:22,957 --> 00:29:26,578
- Dear God!
- You ever parked your bicycle
in an aeroplane hangar?

324
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,590
- I'm sorry?
- You ever thrown an toothpick...

325
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:31,838
into a volcano?

326
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:34,548
- What?
- Oh, nothin'.

327
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:38,901
Just makin' idle chit-chat.
Are you comfortable?

328
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:41,643
- Actually, no.
- Ooh.

329
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:45,516
I'm sweatin'.
You're gettin' me all hot.

330
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:49,808
- You don't like my hair, do you?
- I think there's been a mistake.

331
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,300
- Did you say "steak"?
- No mistake.

332
00:29:52,460 --> 00:29:54,926
- Oh, see, now you got me all excited.
- Look, I'm gay.

333
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:59,500
- Well, how gay are you?
- Very, very gay.

334
00:29:59,685 --> 00:30:01,000
You must have dialled
the Very Gay Escort Service.

335
00:30:01,330 --> 00:30:04,761
Oh, shit. See, sometimes
my fingers swell up...

336
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
and I can't cleanly
hit the numbers.

337
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:10,088
They should make a phone
for full-figured girls.

338
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:12,230
- They should.
- So...

339
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,094
what do we do?

340
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:22,000
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

341
00:30:22,092 --> 00:30:25,103
Cakes and Pies.
Cakes and Pies!

342
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:27,991
Okay, which pie
has the most sugar?

343
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:32,063
- Peach cobbler.
- You win again.
That's four games to one.

344
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:35,185
Well, fast food trivia
is my game, honey.

345
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:41,226
I must tell you, nobody has ever
pleasured Jabba the Slut.

346
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,500
Deucey, you have a way
of satisfying a woman...

347
00:30:43,936 --> 00:30:45,720
that would sicken a normal man.

348
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:47,550
I can't do this any more.

349
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:50,227
You must have
a magical "man-gina."

350
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,148
- Huh?
- "Man-gina."

351
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:56,947
It's a professional term we man-whores
use to describe our he-pussy.

352
00:30:57,700 --> 00:30:59,434
I'm not one of your man-whores.

353
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:00,751
Okay? I quit.

354
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,872
You ungrateful he-bitch.

355
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:05,000
How 'bout I get Antoine on the phone
in Switzerland...

356
00:31:05,494 --> 00:31:08,121
and tell him how you
redecorated his poon palace?

357
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:10,445
I'm not an ungrateful he-bitch.

358
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:13,598
Just give me a minute
to think here.

359
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,000
Thanks.

360
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,828
- How's it going?
- Pretty good.

361
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:46,242
- Hey, Dad, let me ask you a question.
- And what's that, son?

362
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:49,500
Do you think it's wrong for a man
to accept money from a woman...

363
00:31:49,711 --> 00:31:52,077
to, you know,
show her a good time?

364
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:54,316
I was just thinking about that
this morning.

365
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:58,046
The idea of a man-whore
is a relatively new idea.

366
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:02,462
- Cologne?
- No, thanks.

367
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:06,386
These women are looking
for something more than just sex.

368
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,247
- They want romance.
- What do you mean?

369
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:13,015
Well, it was like
when I met your mom.

370
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:14,322
God rest her soul.

371
00:32:14,853 --> 00:32:16,925
I didn't have so much
as a toilet to clean.

372
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:21,234
Still, I wasn't going to pay her
 a dime for sex, no matter what
 she was charging.

373
00:32:21,754 --> 00:32:22,500
What?

374
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:26,125
Well, your mom could have had
any man she wanted in that strip club...

375
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:30,204
and this being my first time in Bangkok,
I was looking for a good time myself.

376
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:32,522
- You met Mom where?
- Oh, it's not important.

377
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,040
The thing is,
she saw something in me...

378
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:37,006
beyond the 200 baht..

379
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,564
a man with an eye
for adventure...

380
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:41,592
who wasn't afraid
to risk it all.

381
00:32:42,688 --> 00:32:43,821
Dad, are.. are you saying that..

382
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,613
So, we took all
her one-dollar bills off the stage...

383
00:32:51,508 --> 00:32:52,617
said goodbye to that donkey...

384
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:55,853
and two days later,
we were man and wife.

385
00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:58,883
And we were happily married,
long time.

386
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:02,855
So, do you think I should be
more of a risk-taker?

387
00:33:03,922 --> 00:33:04,720
Worked for me.

388
00:33:06,057 --> 00:33:07,087
Thanks, Pops.

389
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:11,980
Well, son...

390
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:15,461
Looks like I've got
some work to do.

391
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,448
You got yourself a man-whore.

392
00:33:24,300 --> 00:33:25,435
My man!

393
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:40,175
- Is.. Is Tina here?
- Yes.

394
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:43,298
I'm Deuce Bigalow, her date.

395
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:44,934
I get my things.

396
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:51,834
I love this place.

397
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,111
- Where you from again?
- Norway.

398
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:57,690
- Freak!
- I hear great things about it.

399
00:33:58,432 --> 00:34:01,122
- Holy shit, it's Bigfoot!
- So how'd you end up here?

400
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:04,858
I had a pituitary gland procedure
at UCLA Medical Centre...

401
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:07,000
and I just fell in love
with the people here.

402
00:34:07,015 --> 00:34:10,663
- Hey, keep it in the circus!
- You know, this place has
 gone way downhill.

403
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:13,793
- What do you say we go somewhere else?
- That's a huge bitch!

404
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:18,201
I'm sorry about
what those people said.

405
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:20,864
You should be able to go
on all the rides.

406
00:34:24,100 --> 00:34:26,619
I had a really great time,
but I should go.

407
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:31,327
Easy. Easy!
Take it easy!

408
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:33,500
Wait, wait.

409
00:34:35,161 --> 00:34:36,561
Wait. Hey, I know
what we can do.

410
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,202
I got it. Give me
a second to think here!

411
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:42,971
Wait! Whoa!

412
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:46,277
Oh, yes! Oh!

413
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:48,592
Mmm!

414
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:01,277
Oh, no one has ever
touched my feet before.

415
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,642
Deuce Bigalow?
Detective Fowler, L.A.P.D.

416
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:22,101
I wanna ask you a few questions
about Antoine Laconte...

417
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:25,164
known gigolo, male prostitute.

418
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:30,289
- I'm just taking care of his fish.
- I'll bet you are.

419
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:32,518
You make me sick!

420
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,182
You gonna stand there and tell me
that gigantic woman...

421
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:37,317
didn't just pay you
to have sex with her?

422
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:39,580
- No.
- Let me tell you something, mister.

423
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:44,145
I can sleep at night, because I make
a decent, God-fearin', honest livin'.

424
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:46,991
I'm sure you do,
but there's nothing I can tell you.

425
00:35:47,300 --> 00:35:48,188
I think there is.

426
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:49,737
What do you think of this?

427
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:53,274
- You think I can get anything
for it? You know, money?
- I don't know.

428
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,333
Yeah. You think
I'm a loser, don't you?

429
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:58,737
- No, I don't.
- Well, maybe I am a loser...

430
00:35:59,237 --> 00:36:00,817
but I'm a loser
who can bust your ass.

431
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:05,101
Now you tell Antoine
I'm gonna nail him.

432
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:24,401
- Hello?
- Is this Ruth?

433
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,623
Yeah, I'll be right down.
Goddamn it!

434
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:30,035
- Nice day, huh?
- Yeah.

435
00:36:31,100 --> 00:36:32,295
Shove it up your ass!

436
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,698
Jeez, you okay?

437
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,700
I'm sorry.
I have Tourette's syndrome...

438
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:45,011
and it causes me to have
these uncontrollable outbursts.

439
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
- It's not so bad.
- Yeah. It's okay.

440
00:36:48,039 --> 00:36:49,319
I mean, you get used to it.

441
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:53,354
Ball sweat! Anus!
Anus licker!

442
00:36:55,300 --> 00:37:00,154
You know, there are some places
I can't go! Nipple biter!

443
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:05,378
What are you talkin' about?
I barely notice it.

444
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,786
Scrotum! Sperm!
Sperm face!

445
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:15,168
I just can't go near places
like churches. Ha-ha! Vulva!

446
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,552
Elementary schools.
Jizz! Jizz trap!

447
00:37:19,300 --> 00:37:20,516
Pretty much anywhere.

448
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:22,802
Fart! Dildo!

449
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:25,241
Big.. Big, big titties!

450
00:37:26,246 --> 00:37:28,700
Shit! Shit whore!

451
00:37:28,910 --> 00:37:31,795
Hey, uh, let's put the top up.
I'll put on the air conditioning.

452
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:37,571
You probably want to
take me home, don't you?

453
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:40,240
No.

454
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:42,571
Hey, I got an idea.

455
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:50,220
I'm nervous.
There's a lot of people here.

456
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:51,895
- Don't worry.
- Crap muncher!

457
00:37:53,489 --> 00:37:54,305
- "Crap muncher"?
- I know!

458
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:55,594
He was definitely safe!

459
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:59,384
- Hey, what do you think
about the other team?
- Assholes!

460
00:37:59,775 --> 00:38:00,492
- Hey, keep it down.
- Right.

461
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:05,110
And.. And their pitcher. I mean,
stop stalling and throw it already.

462
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:07,500
- Ball hair!
- "Ball hair"?
- Ball hair!

463
00:38:08,128 --> 00:38:09,259
Yeah, ball hair.

464
00:38:09,700 --> 00:38:11,979
What we need is
a strike hair.

465
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,342
That other team's
a bunch of high-priced babies!

466
00:38:15,671 --> 00:38:17,721
- Whores!
- Yeah! You tell 'em, darlin'!

467
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:25,512
- They called him out?
- S-Scrotum licker!

468
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:27,000
- Yeah!
- Scrotum licker!

469
00:38:27,164 --> 00:38:29,688
Piss face! Piss face! Piss face!

470
00:38:29,900 --> 00:38:31,044
Piss face! Piss face!

471
00:38:31,412 --> 00:38:33,656
Piss face! Piss face!
Piss face! Piss face!

472
00:38:33,981 --> 00:38:36,500
Piss face! Piss face! Piss face!

473
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:42,224
Deucey, you the best he-bitch
in my man-stable.

474
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,506
If I had two more "man-ginas" like you,
I'd be a millionaire.

475
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:49,049
- T.J., I think I'm gonna get out.
- Sit down.

476
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:52,424
This next date is what we man-pimps
call a doozy.

477
00:38:53,450 --> 00:38:55,393
- What's wrong with this one?
- Nothin'.

478
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:59,125
Have you seen her?
What is she, 80? Hunchbacked?

479
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:00,973
She just got outta college.

480
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:03,783
Some of her girlfriends pitched in
to get her a little beefcake.

481
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,851
- She thinks it's a blind date.
- It's a guy, isn't it?

482
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:11,910
I don't think so,
but I have been fooled before.

483
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,717
- You must be Kate.
- Excuse me. Waiter.

484
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:39,820
Ah. Uh, yes. Sorry.
We're busy tonight.

485
00:39:39,900 --> 00:39:40,600
I'll have the..

486
00:39:41,715 --> 00:39:43,500
- A number four?
- Yes. Thank you.

487
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,012
- I'm Kate.
- Are you sure?

488
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:55,798
- Think so.
- I'm sorry. You're just
not what I expected.

489
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:58,893
- Really.
- No, no.

490
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:01,411
I mean, in, uh..
in a good way.

491
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:06,265
They didn't say
you were so perfect.

492
00:40:07,552 --> 00:40:08,437
"Perfect."

493
00:40:09,700 --> 00:40:11,971
So, Sally and Megan
didn't tell me a lot about you.

494
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:13,725
Who?

495
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:19,485
Oh, right, uh..
Well, I clean, uh, tanks.. ers..

496
00:40:20,300 --> 00:40:21,086
Tankers.

497
00:40:22,300 --> 00:40:23,878
I'm sorry.
I'm still kinda shocked.

498
00:40:24,500 --> 00:40:26,933
I mean, you're..
you're really normal.

499
00:40:28,544 --> 00:40:29,600
Thank you.

500
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,749
My last couple of dates
have been horrible.

501
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,494
Oh, you get fixed up
on a lot of blind dates?

502
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:36,489
Only recently.

503
00:40:37,988 --> 00:40:40,036
- H-How 'bout you?
- This is my first.

504
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:44,513
- I hope this place is okay.
- Are you kidding? It's terrific.

505
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,066
- Oh, God!
- Are you okay?

506
00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:53,738
- Is this one of those, uh..
- It's a sushi bar.

507
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,904
- Are you allergic?
- You could say that.

508
00:40:57,500 --> 00:40:58,927
That's a dog-faced
puffer fish over there.

509
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:02,509
He's not even fully matured yet.
He's a teenager, for crying out loud.

510
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:07,920
Can I ask you
to stop that, please?

511
00:41:12,300 --> 00:41:15,216
I don't see how it could possibly
be pleasurable for a woman.

512
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:18,586
I just don't think it's natural.

513
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:20,692
You're not supposed to go up there.

514
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:23,344
To tell you the truth,
I don't know how men do it either.

515
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:26,517
You're not curious,
just to try somethin' new?

516
00:41:27,500 --> 00:41:28,949
I'm just not into it.

517
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:33,000
So space exploration
is definitely out for you?

518
00:41:33,055 --> 00:41:36,000
Definitely. I mean, more power to any
woman who wants to be an astronaut.

519
00:41:36,455 --> 00:41:37,500
I just wouldn't do it.

520
00:41:38,500 --> 00:41:40,200
Frankly, I'd rather
take it up the butt.

521
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:46,619
So you think this is a good spot?

522
00:41:48,700 --> 00:41:49,750
It's perfect.

523
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:56,206
Life's funny, huh?
Some pretty close calls.

524
00:41:58,500 --> 00:42:00,569
I wonder if he knew
how close he came to the end?

525
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:02,279
Oh, he knew.

526
00:42:04,096 --> 00:42:07,114
I bet he never thought he'd
be held by such a lovely woman.

527
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:09,000
Deuce.

528
00:42:09,276 --> 00:42:11,500
You're embarrassing me
in front of our new friend.

529
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:24,911
That was a really nice thing
you did tonight.

530
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,515
Too bad it's a freshwater fish.

531
00:42:31,591 --> 00:42:33,830
I...I'm kidding, see?
I'm just joking.

532
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:39,548
**Take some time
For our feelings to grow**

533
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:43,990
Good night.

534
00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:48,800
**I can't let you go**

535
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,436
**And I can't let go**

536
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:00,000
**With you I'm not shy**

537
00:43:00,213 --> 00:43:02,000
**To show the way I feel**

538
00:43:02,643 --> 00:43:04,601
**With you I might..**

539
00:43:06,420 --> 00:43:08,065
You've had yourself
an interesting little evening.

540
00:43:08,860 --> 00:43:11,635
Just takin' care of his fish, huh?
She looks like a nice catch.

541
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:13,290
It was a first date.

542
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:17,000
Listen up, man-whore.
I oughta bust you right now!

543
00:43:17,018 --> 00:43:20,433
- We just had sushi.
- "Sushi." Is that what
they call it nowadays?

544
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:22,651
Well, I'm hip
to your man-whore slang.

545
00:43:23,500 --> 00:43:24,265
All right, fine.

546
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:27,795
Why don't I just go have a little chat
with your spicy tuna roll, huh?

547
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:29,634
No, don't!

548
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,206
All right. Okay, Deuce.

549
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,529
No problem, baby. Relax.

550
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,366
Maybe I'll even let this one slide
for some information.

551
00:43:39,300 --> 00:43:41,000
Like Antoine's black book.
You know.

552
00:43:41,189 --> 00:43:44,360
- The one with his list of clients?
- I don't know anything about it.

553
00:43:44,500 --> 00:43:47,141
Oh, yeah?
You know anything about this?

554
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,488
See that red spot over there?

555
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:51,485
That wasn't there this morning.
I checked.

556
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,200
- You know what it is?
- Maybe it's a rash.

557
00:43:54,441 --> 00:43:57,303
Something you got from jogging. How the
hell do I know? Get it away from me.

558
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:02,409
Maybe you're right.
You got three days, Bigalow!

559
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:13,937
T.J., I really like this girl.

560
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:18,373
Deucey, don't be fallin' in love with
no she-John. You're in it for the money.

561
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,823
Antoine will be back pretty soon.
Apartment ain't gonna pay to fix itself.

562
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:25,257
I know. Hey, there's been
this detective followin' me.

563
00:44:25,500 --> 00:44:28,661
Goddamn it, white boy! You didn't
tell him nothin' about me, did you?

564
00:44:29,100 --> 00:44:30,273
No, but what should I do?

565
00:44:32,500 --> 00:44:34,964
- About what?
- About the cop!

566
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,188
Will you stop mentionin'
the damn cops?

567
00:44:37,500 --> 00:44:39,493
Don't make me
he-bitch man-slap you!

568
00:44:50,600 --> 00:44:53,885
Hi, I'm Deuce Bigalow,
your man-whore for this evening.

569
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:55,392
Hi, I'm Carol..

570
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,325
I have narcolepsy.
It's.. It's a sleeping disorder.

571
00:45:01,500 --> 00:45:03,024
It isn't the worst thing
you could ever have.

572
00:45:03,500 --> 00:45:06,013
I'm just not allowed to fly
an aeroplane or.. or drive a car...

573
00:45:06,748 --> 00:45:08,026
or work in a gun range.

574
00:45:09,500 --> 00:45:11,084
Yeah.

575
00:45:28,500 --> 00:45:32,796
This is such a treat.
I've always wanted to try soup,
but there's the fear of drowning.

576
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,402
- I really had fun.
- Are you gonna be okay?

577
00:45:47,500 --> 00:45:49,404
- I'll be fine.
- You sure?

578
00:45:49,700 --> 00:45:51,213
- Yeah.
- Good night.

579
00:46:15,454 --> 00:46:17,798
**I can't get enough of you, baby**

580
00:46:19,138 --> 00:46:21,463
**I can't get enough of you, baby**

581
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:23,230
**Yes, it's true**

582
00:46:25,500 --> 00:46:27,282
**Yes, it's true**

583
00:46:30,483 --> 00:46:33,117
**Whenever we kiss
I get to feelin' like this**

584
00:46:33,400 --> 00:46:35,855
**I get to wishin '
that there were two of you**

585
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:38,895
**Come on.
You can dance.**

586
00:46:39,500 --> 00:46:40,540
**Come on, baby**

587
00:46:41,414 --> 00:46:42,915
**It feels so nice**

588
00:46:43,401 --> 00:46:44,500
**I want your arms to**

589
00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:48,394
**Wrap around me twice**

590
00:46:52,648 --> 00:46:55,094
**I can't get enough of you, baby**

591
00:46:56,357 --> 00:46:58,618
**I can't get enough of you, baby**

592
00:46:59,478 --> 00:47:00,344
**Right or wrong**

593
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:03,874
**Baby, right or wrong**

594
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:14,791
**I can't get enough of you, baby**
- Ohh, Deuce.

595
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:17,364
- You look great.
- Thanks.

596
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:21,318
- I want you to meet my roommate.
- Who's there? Kate?

597
00:47:21,600 --> 00:47:24,163
- I hear someone.
- It's just me and my friend.

598
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:26,884
Are you sure?
I hear three people.

599
00:47:27,500 --> 00:47:28,652
You're the third person.

600
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:30,898
Oh. Oh, okay.

601
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:33,382
She's newly blind.
She's still getting adjusted.

602
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:36,893
Bergita, this is Deuce.

603
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:39,509
I think there's
something wrong with Cassie.

604
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:41,152
Oh, honey.

605
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:44,102
This isn't Cassie.

606
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:46,352
Here she is.

607
00:47:47,400 --> 00:47:50,038
Oh, there you are.

608
00:47:50,500 --> 00:47:52,448
- It's nice to meet you.
- Hi.

609
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,840
Once you try it for the first time,
you're pretty happy with the results.

610
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:01,753
I've never met
a hair transplant technician before.

611
00:48:09,123 --> 00:48:12,483
Oh, man! I forgot.
It's my dad's birthday.

612
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:14,729
- Let's go see him.
- He's working.

613
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:16,608
So, what does he do?

614
00:48:18,300 --> 00:48:20,717
He's in the restaurant industry.

615
00:48:24,200 --> 00:48:27,200
Kate, I'd like you
to meet my dad, Bob Bigalow.

616
00:48:27,572 --> 00:48:28,779
Bob, Kate.

617
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:33,040
- Hi.
- Son, I'm very proud of you.

618
00:48:33,500 --> 00:48:35,827
She is a lovely young lady.

619
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:37,800
Thank you.

620
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:41,700
It's so nice to meet you.
Happy birthday.

621
00:48:42,010 --> 00:48:44,095
- Thank you.
- Well, we should probably be going.

622
00:48:44,500 --> 00:48:45,659
Deuce.

623
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,448
Dad probably has a lot
of paperwork to do and..

624
00:48:49,700 --> 00:48:51,622
No, the paper's
completely stocked.

625
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,714
I've got plenty of time to get
more acquainted with the woman...

626
00:48:54,900 --> 00:48:56,812
who's made my boy so happy.

627
00:48:57,300 --> 00:49:00,649
We got you a cake.
Deuce said it's your favourite.

628
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:03,312
We had to go to
a Filipino bakery to get it.

629
00:49:03,800 --> 00:49:04,939
You didn't.

630
00:49:05,800 --> 00:49:09,600
You did!
Raspberry bibingka?

631
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:11,404
Aw, you shouldn't have.

632
00:49:11,700 --> 00:49:14,200
My wife,
God rest her soul...

633
00:49:14,416 --> 00:49:15,976
used to make this all the time.

634
00:49:16,500 --> 00:49:17,600
You would have liked her.

635
00:49:18,500 --> 00:49:20,251
Bangkok Betty.

636
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:25,451
She had the most amazing mouth.
It paid for our honeymoon.

637
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:31,031
- Well, we should probably be going.
- Deuce, it's your dad's birthday.

638
00:49:34,500 --> 00:49:38,200
Hi, Bob. We have an overflowing toilet
in the ladies' bathroom.

639
00:49:38,610 --> 00:49:39,800
There is shit everywhere.

640
00:49:40,028 --> 00:49:42,200
It's a real mess. You think you can get
in there and take care of that for me?

641
00:49:42,600 --> 00:49:44,247
No worries, Vic.
Right on it.

642
00:49:44,900 --> 00:49:46,660
I'd like you to meet
my son's girlfriend Kate.

643
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,255
- Kate, nice to meet you.
- You too.
- Hi, Deuce.

644
00:49:49,700 --> 00:49:50,639
So, could you get in there, Bob?

645
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:55,604
I mean, I got a party of ten coming in,
and I am up to my ankles in human crap.

646
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:57,442
It's a real stink-fest back there.

647
00:49:58,000 --> 00:49:58,786
Sure.

648
00:49:59,400 --> 00:50:02,075
Well, looks like
I better get back to work.

649
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:04,570
It's a pleasure
meeting you, dear.

650
00:50:05,300 --> 00:50:07,519
It warms my heart
just being in your presence.

651
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:09,278
Oh, thank you.

652
00:50:10,200 --> 00:50:11,622
See you, son.

653
00:50:15,800 --> 00:50:17,720
See, my dad's
one of those guys, uh..

654
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:19,975
- He likes to be involved
in every facet of the business.
- It's okay.

655
00:50:20,200 --> 00:50:22,400
There.. There's no, uh, problem
too small or too big.

656
00:50:22,526 --> 00:50:25,352
- I mean, they come to him
for everything.
- Deuce, it's all right.

657
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:29,337
It's not his restaurant.

658
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:32,837
My dad's not even a waiter.

659
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:37,077
He's the men's room attendant.
I'm sorry.

660
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:39,536
Don't be silly.

661
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:42,327
You know what my dad does?

662
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:45,212
He's an aeronautical engineer.

663
00:50:56,500 --> 00:50:58,099
Bob?

664
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:04,598
Wanna blow out your candle?

665
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,495
Mmm, now that's good bibingka.

666
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:28,344
I had a really nice time tonight.

667
00:51:29,500 --> 00:51:31,293
I find that hard to believe.

668
00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:36,948
I've never met anyone like you.

669
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:39,339
Good.

670
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:42,590
I have to see you again.

671
00:51:45,300 --> 00:51:48,776
When we go inside, try to be quiet
so we don't wake up Bergita.

672
00:51:53,200 --> 00:51:54,600
**With you I'm not shy**

673
00:51:54,858 --> 00:51:57,241
**To show the way I feel**

674
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:01,000
**With you I might try**

675
00:52:01,395 --> 00:52:03,284
**My secrets to reveal**

676
00:52:04,200 --> 00:52:07,006
**For you are a magnet**

677
00:52:07,790 --> 00:52:11,000
**And I am steel**

678
00:52:11,441 --> 00:52:13,000
Why don't I get the light?

679
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,598
Hang on. I'll be right back.
Be right back.

680
00:52:27,400 --> 00:52:28,612
You are good.

681
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:40,080
- Hi.
- Hi.

682
00:52:43,400 --> 00:52:44,984
Are you all right?

683
00:52:46,200 --> 00:52:48,402
I need you
to be okay with something.

684
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:50,959
What? I'm okay with everything.

685
00:52:51,500 --> 00:52:52,600
Deuce.

686
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:55,693
There may be things about me
that you don't like.

687
00:52:56,600 --> 00:52:58,188
I like everything about you.

688
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:01,603
I mean, physically.

689
00:53:02,600 --> 00:53:06,000
So you're taller than me.
Big deal. I'll get over it.

690
00:53:06,102 --> 00:53:07,464
It's not that.

691
00:53:08,500 --> 00:53:09,469
What?

692
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:16,000
If you were to find out something
about me and my body that was...

693
00:53:16,161 --> 00:53:19,073
maybe a little different than what you
were used to, would that be okay?

694
00:53:20,200 --> 00:53:23,400
There could be nothing on your body
that I wouldn't like.

695
00:53:24,200 --> 00:53:25,593
What are you talkin' about?

696
00:53:27,600 --> 00:53:30,676
What, you got, like, six toes
or something? I can live with that.

697
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:36,057
- Deuce, I have to tell you. I have a..
- Shh.

698
00:54:06,200 --> 00:54:09,576
Oh, my God! I'm sorry!

699
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,700
- I tried to tell you!
- No, it's my fault.

700
00:54:13,036 --> 00:54:15,091
I shouldn't have
pulled it so hard.

701
00:54:15,600 --> 00:54:17,500
If you wanna leave,
I completely understand.

702
00:54:17,844 --> 00:54:20,500
I don't wanna leave.
I'm sorry I had that reaction.

703
00:54:20,757 --> 00:54:22,600
I just.. I got a lot of things
going on in my life recently...

704
00:54:22,916 --> 00:54:24,760
and they all sort of culminated
when your leg fell off..

705
00:54:25,200 --> 00:54:27,000
came off.. disconnected.. I..

706
00:54:27,164 --> 00:54:29,800
-Just get out.
- Oh, my God!

707
00:54:30,003 --> 00:54:30,757
Please, leave!

708
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:39,305
Just go home.

709
00:54:39,800 --> 00:54:41,233
Don't I have a say in this?

710
00:54:41,900 --> 00:54:44,836
- Hand me my leg.
- Then will you come out and talk?

711
00:54:45,200 --> 00:54:46,409
I don't know.

712
00:54:54,800 --> 00:54:56,069
Are you sure you want to stay?

713
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:59,813
Yes, but only
If you come out of there.

714
00:55:01,700 --> 00:55:04,161
I need to know how you feel
about all this.

715
00:55:05,500 --> 00:55:07,390
The same as I did an hour ago...

716
00:55:08,700 --> 00:55:11,734
when I thought to myself,
"I'm the luckiest guy in the world...

717
00:55:11,900 --> 00:55:13,000
to be with her leg.."

718
00:55:13,170 --> 00:55:14,420
with you.

719
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:43,573
Ow.

720
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:47,000
Is this normal?
My face is numb.

721
00:55:47,058 --> 00:55:49,954
It's perfectly normal
in hair replacement surgery.

722
00:55:50,200 --> 00:55:53,200
The local anaesthetic has numbed
the major nerves in your face...

723
00:55:53,400 --> 00:55:55,100
just like at the dentist.

724
00:55:55,500 --> 00:55:58,198
Ow!

725
00:55:58,800 --> 00:56:00,760
You're Kate's best friends, and...

726
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:04,159
I know your opinions
mean a lot to her, and...

727
00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:06,047
I'd like to get
really serious with her.

728
00:56:06,800 --> 00:56:09,376
- You're a prostitute!
- Not any more.

729
00:56:09,800 --> 00:56:13,196
And it's "man-whore."
Anyway, I just quit.

730
00:56:13,400 --> 00:56:15,183
- I mean, Kate's the one for me.
- Listen.

731
00:56:15,600 --> 00:56:17,328
You were only supposed to go
out with her one night...

732
00:56:17,500 --> 00:56:19,569
show her a good time, and then
get the hell out of her life.

733
00:56:19,700 --> 00:56:22,200
- You know she's not normal.
- She's not like other girls.

734
00:56:22,639 --> 00:56:25,261
You know what her problem is?
Friends like you.

735
00:56:25,600 --> 00:56:27,673
She's perfect. She's kind.

736
00:56:27,800 --> 00:56:30,886
She's sweet, she's funny,
and she likes me.

737
00:56:31,200 --> 00:56:33,417
Now, I came here
to give you your money back...

738
00:56:33,600 --> 00:56:36,341
the money you paid a stranger
to have sex with your friend.

739
00:56:39,100 --> 00:56:41,811
Hey! You stay away
from her, man-whore!

740
00:56:42,900 --> 00:56:45,882
Hi ya, Deuce. Your three days
are up, lover boy.

741
00:56:46,200 --> 00:56:47,737
So where's Antoine's black book?

742
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:49,822
- I've looked everywhere.
- Listen, punk.

743
00:56:50,200 --> 00:56:52,250
You are aiding and abetting
a known criminal.

744
00:56:52,500 --> 00:56:54,727
Do the initials T and J
mean anything to you?

745
00:56:55,200 --> 00:56:56,984
Uh, turkey jizz?
I don't..

746
00:56:57,200 --> 00:56:59,100
You better show some respect,
or I'm gonna rip that little...

747
00:56:59,500 --> 00:57:01,418
pleasure-giving tongue of yours
right out of your head!

748
00:57:01,800 --> 00:57:02,852
One more thing.

749
00:57:03,250 --> 00:57:05,517
I was at the precinct,
and I really had to use the john...

750
00:57:06,100 --> 00:57:08,097
and it's pretty filthy in there,
and I was in kind of a hurry.

751
00:57:08,500 --> 00:57:11,173
I didn't have enough time to use one
Of those, you know, paper ass gaskets.

752
00:57:11,600 --> 00:57:13,000
Anyway, I was doin' my business,
and, uh...

753
00:57:13,200 --> 00:57:15,007
something splashed up on me,
you know, all over?

754
00:57:15,300 --> 00:57:18,288
What do you do in situations like that?
You think I'll be all right?

755
00:57:19,200 --> 00:57:22,000
- I think you're pretty safe.
- I better be.

756
00:57:28,300 --> 00:57:29,935
Ugly is not a problem
for this guy.

757
00:57:30,200 --> 00:57:32,169
My man would stick his dick
in a he-monkey.

758
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:33,618
All right, holler at you later.

759
00:57:36,200 --> 00:57:37,137
What up, Deucey?

760
00:57:39,200 --> 00:57:41,098
You should know that cop
won't leave me alone.

761
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:45,629
- What about the cop?
- He's been asking questions.

762
00:57:45,900 --> 00:57:46,882
Goddamn, white boy.

763
00:57:47,300 --> 00:57:48,909
Anyway, it doesn't matter
to me any more.

764
00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:51,658
- I'm quitting.
- What about Antoine's apartment?

765
00:57:52,600 --> 00:57:54,656
I'm gonna get the rest of the money
the old-fashioned way.

766
00:57:54,800 --> 00:57:55,577
You gonna steal it?

767
00:57:58,500 --> 00:57:59,871
See ya, T.J.

768
00:58:08,600 --> 00:58:10,269
Uh, see, I just quit.
I'm never doing it again.

769
00:58:11,100 --> 00:58:13,423
- You lied to me!
- Listen, please.

770
00:58:13,600 --> 00:58:16,722
- It's not what you think.
- You were paid to go out with me!

771
00:58:23,242 --> 00:58:24,851
- You want breakfast?
- Kate!

772
00:58:25,500 --> 00:58:27,020
Just go away!

773
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,857
- I never want to see you again!
- Me neither.

774
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:35,048
I'm sorry.

775
00:58:44,800 --> 00:58:47,160
**I feel sad when you're sad**

776
00:58:48,200 --> 00:58:50,584
**I feel glad when you're glad**

777
00:58:50,900 --> 00:58:54,030
**And if you only knew
what I'm goin' through**

778
00:58:55,500 --> 00:59:00,095
**I just can't smile
Without you**

779
00:59:05,200 --> 00:59:08,200
**You came along
just like a song**

780
00:59:08,526 --> 00:59:10,537
**And brightened my day**

781
00:59:11,365 --> 00:59:13,700
**Who'd have believed
you were part of a dream**

782
00:59:13,817 --> 00:59:17,108
**And now it all seems
light years away**

783
00:59:17,400 --> 00:59:22,608
**And you know
I can't smile without you**

784
00:59:23,800 --> 00:59:26,000
**I can't smile without you**

785
00:59:26,257 --> 00:59:29,733
**And I can't laugh
I can't sing**

786
00:59:30,200 --> 00:59:33,422
**I'm findin' it hard
to do anything**

787
00:59:35,850 --> 00:59:38,600
I'm 1500 short. Isn't there
anything else you can do?

788
00:59:38,800 --> 00:59:41,827
Listen, I came all over the place..
down from six grand.

789
00:59:42,200 --> 00:59:44,620
This is a custom hand job.

790
00:59:44,800 --> 00:59:45,765
Let me pay you monthly.

791
00:59:46,150 --> 00:59:49,196
The last time I didn't get the money
up front, I got the big stiffie.

792
00:59:52,200 --> 00:59:52,900
Hello?

793
00:59:53,500 --> 00:59:55,000
What the hell are you doing
picking up my phone?

794
00:59:55,048 --> 00:59:56,052
I found the coral you wanted.

795
00:59:56,661 --> 00:59:59,464
If you're doing anything I disapprove of
in my apartment, I will kill you.

796
01:00:00,300 --> 01:00:02,098
Rip your veins out one by one!

797
01:00:03,500 --> 01:00:05,310
Murder! I will kill you!

798
01:00:10,200 --> 01:00:14,285
Hey, Antoine, it's Elaine.
I really need to see you again.

799
01:00:15,200 --> 01:00:16,782
Same price, same place?

800
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:19,740
I'll have the money.

801
01:00:21,500 --> 01:00:26,709
Hi. Um, this isn't Antoine but
maybe we can work something out.

802
01:00:33,000 --> 01:01:33,303
Hi.

803
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:48,743
I'm Deuce.

804
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:08,653
- Stop.
- Why?

805
01:01:09,800 --> 01:01:11,869
- You don't wanna have sex.
- Yes, I do.

806
01:01:13,300 --> 01:01:14,667
I think we both do.

807
01:01:18,200 --> 01:01:19,445
Don't you find me attractive?

808
01:01:20,600 --> 01:01:24,012
Are you kidding? You're one
Of the hottest women I've ever seen.

809
01:01:24,800 --> 01:01:25,932
Easy, easy.

810
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:28,301
I just can't do this.

811
01:01:29,800 --> 01:01:31,579
I'm head over heels
for a girl, and...

812
01:01:31,900 --> 01:01:34,060
we're goin' through a rough time,
me bein' a man-whore and all...

813
01:01:34,600 --> 01:01:37,149
but I know it's gonna work out,
because I love her.

814
01:01:39,200 --> 01:01:40,519
She's a lucky girl.

815
01:01:42,500 --> 01:01:44,192
At least emotionally.

816
01:01:45,400 --> 01:01:48,211
- My guy used to be like that.
- Hey.

817
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:51,396
Hang in there.

818
01:01:53,900 --> 01:01:55,675
Things have a way of working out.

819
01:02:01,200 --> 01:02:03,256
Hey, where you goin'?

820
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:08,518
Well, I thought we talked
and you understood.

821
01:02:08,891 --> 01:02:12,198
I understand, but the fact is
I still paid for your services.

822
01:02:13,600 --> 01:02:14,580
Then what do you have in mind?

823
01:02:24,800 --> 01:02:27,989
**Baby, let's get together**

824
01:02:29,100 --> 01:02:31,637
**Honey, hon, me and you**

825
01:02:32,900 --> 01:02:34,642
**And do the things
Ah**

826
01:02:35,200 --> 01:02:36,534
**Do the things**

827
01:02:37,900 --> 01:02:39,713
**That we like to do**

828
01:02:40,800 --> 01:02:42,341
**Oh, do a little dance**

829
01:02:43,400 --> 01:02:46,081
**Make a little love
Get down tonight**

830
01:02:47,200 --> 01:02:48,068
**Get down tonight**

831
01:02:49,700 --> 01:02:52,653
**Do a little dance
Make a little love**

832
01:02:53,600 --> 01:02:54,367
**Get down tonight**

833
01:02:55,600 --> 01:02:57,131
**Get down tonight, baby**

834
01:02:57,500 --> 01:02:58,981
**Oh, get down, get down**

835
01:02:59,500 --> 01:03:00,016
**Get down, get down**

836
01:03:00,500 --> 01:03:03,000
**Get down tonight, baby**

837
01:03:03,270 --> 01:03:05,500
**Woo, woo, woo, woo
woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo**

838
01:03:06,017 --> 01:03:08,783
**Get down, get down,
get down, get down**

839
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:29,713
- I'm exhausted.
- Oh, God, you were amazing.

840
01:03:29,900 --> 01:03:31,224
Are you kidding?

841
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:37,459
I just had to see for myself.

842
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:47,986
Kate!

843
01:03:48,500 --> 01:03:49,786
**I'm not in love**

844
01:03:51,841 --> 01:03:54,309
**I'm not in love**

845
01:04:07,200 --> 01:04:08,182
- What?
- How's Elaine?

846
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:11,469
You know, your wife.

847
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:15,000
- Bastard!
- Oh!

848
01:04:15,031 --> 01:04:16,622
This wasn't about some black book.

849
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:19,111
Your wife was a customer
of Antoine's, wasn't she?

850
01:04:19,600 --> 01:04:22,452
That son of a bitch is goin' down,
and you're gonna join him!

851
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:26,590
How's that gonna fix your marriage?

852
01:04:31,500 --> 01:04:33,056
Look, I lost someone
that I love too.

853
01:04:35,600 --> 01:04:37,243
You know why she did this?

854
01:04:38,800 --> 01:04:40,656
You wanna know why
she went outside our marriage?

855
01:04:41,800 --> 01:04:43,513
It's because of my dick, man!

856
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:46,093
I mean, that's the reason.
It's my dick!

857
01:04:46,800 --> 01:04:47,878
Look, take it easy.

858
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:52,000
You're saying your wife cheated on you
because your penis is too small?

859
01:04:52,259 --> 01:04:55,084
It's not too small!
It's too thin! Okay?

860
01:04:55,400 --> 01:04:56,609
My dick is too thin!

861
01:04:57,200 --> 01:04:59,193
I got a thin dick!

862
01:04:59,200 --> 01:05:02,200
Okay, can you keep it down?
I'd like to come back here someday.

863
01:05:02,317 --> 01:05:06,200
Everybody knows that it's width,
width that gives sexual gratification.

864
01:05:06,452 --> 01:05:08,883
I've read it.
Cosmo, Redbook, you name it.

865
01:05:09,300 --> 01:05:12,457
What am I supposed to do?
I got the thinnest penis in the world.

866
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:14,400
Here.
It's like a Twizzler.

867
01:05:14,535 --> 01:05:16,451
- Look!
- No, no! Stop that!

868
01:05:16,800 --> 01:05:19,160
Look, sit down! Sit!

869
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:22,639
It's not your dick!
It's you!

870
01:05:23,400 --> 01:05:26,000
I'm tellin' you now, if you painted it
silver and twisted it on the end...

871
01:05:26,062 --> 01:05:27,316
it'd look like a kickstand.

872
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:30,783
If man-whoring
has taught me anything...

873
01:05:31,200 --> 01:05:33,743
it's that most women are
as unhappy with their entire body...

874
01:05:34,200 --> 01:05:35,784
as you are
with your small penis.

875
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:37,676
- Thin penis.
- Well, whatever.

876
01:05:39,200 --> 01:05:40,700
While you're worried
about your penis...

877
01:05:40,777 --> 01:05:41,828
Thin penis.

878
01:05:42,100 --> 01:05:44,211
women are worried about their height...

879
01:05:44,800 --> 01:05:47,070
their weight,
their giant feet...

880
01:05:47,600 --> 01:05:48,300
the stream of obscenities...

881
01:05:48,583 --> 01:05:50,228
that could burst through their mouth
at any second.

882
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:52,941
If you make a woman
feel good about herself...

883
01:05:53,900 --> 01:05:55,795
it really doesn't matter
what's wrong with you.

884
01:05:58,500 --> 01:05:59,937
Even if it's really, really thin?

885
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:02,300
We're talkin' spaghetti stick.

886
01:06:05,100 --> 01:06:06,105
Tell you what.

887
01:06:06,800 --> 01:06:10,046
Every time you're feeling
self-conscious about your thin dick...

888
01:06:10,300 --> 01:06:13,625
say something nice
to make your woman feel sexy.

889
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:18,363
I mean, is that it?
Is that all there is?

890
01:06:20,800 --> 01:06:22,069
There is one other thing.

891
01:06:23,600 --> 01:06:24,936
**Do a little dance**

892
01:06:25,800 --> 01:06:26,865
**Make a little love**

893
01:06:27,500 --> 01:06:28,502
**Get down tonight**

894
01:06:29,621 --> 01:06:30,601
**Get down tonight**

895
01:06:31,800 --> 01:06:33,140
**Do a little dance**

896
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:35,171
**Make a little love**

897
01:06:35,700 --> 01:06:36,678
**Get down tonight**

898
01:06:37,500 --> 01:06:38,714
**Get down tonight**

899
01:06:39,100 --> 01:06:39,857
Uh, yes, sir.

900
01:06:41,500 --> 01:06:44,787
Um, you're sure there isn't
anything you can do?

901
01:06:47,400 --> 01:06:48,563
Yes, sir. I understand.

902
01:06:56,200 --> 01:07:00,008
Listen. I really appreciate
you helping me.

903
01:07:01,100 --> 01:07:02,197
I guess I misjudged you.

904
01:07:04,200 --> 01:07:05,519
Anyway, I got you off the hook.

905
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:09,861
- Why am I still worried?
- You gotta give 'em T.J.

906
01:07:10,900 --> 01:07:11,823
I can't do that.

907
01:07:12,200 --> 01:07:14,533
You got no choice. I been workin' on this case for three months.

908
01:07:15,300 --> 01:07:18,524
-Boss says somebody's gotta be arrested.
-But T.J.'s my friend.

909
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:20,100
They're serious, Deuce.

910
01:07:21,900 --> 01:07:24,725
Look, I don't like it,
but it's either you or him.

911
01:07:28,500 --> 01:07:29,219
Your Honour...

912
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:33,463
sex for money
is morally reprehensible.

913
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:38,446
Mr. Bigalow has compounded this crime
by refusing to name his he-pimp.

914
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:41,641
Therefore we ask
for the maximum term for each...

915
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:44,262
of the five counts
of prostitution.

916
01:08:06,707 --> 01:08:08,400
Excuse me.

917
01:08:21,900 --> 01:08:23,500
We never had sex.

918
01:08:24,500 --> 01:08:25,728
We talked about it.

919
01:08:26,300 --> 01:08:28,019
Well, I talked about it.

920
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:31,058
But Deuce
never took advantage of me.

921
01:08:31,900 --> 01:08:35,487
He should have,
but he's my friend.

922
01:08:36,300 --> 01:08:38,009
He made me realize
that I wasn't just some...

923
01:08:38,700 --> 01:08:40,649
hot babe with huge tits...

924
01:08:41,400 --> 01:08:42,924
even though I am.

925
01:08:43,800 --> 01:08:46,669
Oh, and he also
got me walkin' again.

926
01:08:53,500 --> 01:08:54,843
Deuce and I never had sex.

927
01:08:55,400 --> 01:08:58,192
- It was physically impossible.
- Freak!

928
01:08:59,800 --> 01:09:01,574
It's true I paid him money
to be with him...

929
01:09:02,100 --> 01:09:05,518
and I'd do it again, because he
made me feel good about myself.

930
01:09:06,100 --> 01:09:07,778
Behemoth.

931
01:09:09,700 --> 01:09:12,386
And no one
ever touched my feet before.

932
01:09:13,100 --> 01:09:14,225
That's a huge bitch!

933
01:09:16,500 --> 01:09:18,523
Deuce taught me to be comfortable
with who I am.

934
01:09:19,800 --> 01:09:21,477
Thank you, Deuce.

935
01:09:21,800 --> 01:09:22,889
You asshole!

936
01:09:26,500 --> 01:09:29,078
These are very serious charges,
Mr. Bigalow.

937
01:09:29,400 --> 01:09:31,053
I just have one question to ask you.

938
01:09:31,500 --> 01:09:33,300
During your entire stint
as a he-whore...

939
01:09:33,432 --> 01:09:34,537
did you have sex with anyone?

940
01:09:37,600 --> 01:09:38,427
Yes, Your Honour.

941
01:09:41,200 --> 01:09:41,924
Just one woman.

942
01:09:44,200 --> 01:09:47,198
- And I'm in love with her.
- Order.

943
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:49,821
Order, please.

944
01:09:51,100 --> 01:09:52,847
This is very important,
Mr. Bigalow.

945
01:09:53,500 --> 01:09:55,484
Did she pay you for sex?

946
01:09:58,466 --> 01:09:59,209
No.

947
01:10:01,200 --> 01:10:02,256
Case dismissed.

948
01:10:03,300 --> 01:10:04,734
Yes!

949
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:21,436
These shots will deaden
the nerve area...

950
01:10:21,900 --> 01:10:23,806
where your hair transplants will be.

951
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:27,588
There. That should do it.

952
01:10:28,100 --> 01:10:30,558
Nurse, would you please remove
our donor hair?

953
01:10:31,500 --> 01:10:32,572
I'll be back in a minute.

954
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:47,461
Mr. Johnson, please just lie
back down now.

955
01:10:48,200 --> 01:10:49,588
Oh, my God! Deuce!

956
01:10:50,600 --> 01:10:53,447
- Kate, listen to me.
- What are you doing here?

957
01:10:55,100 --> 01:10:57,166
It's the only way
I could get you to see me.

958
01:10:58,000 --> 01:10:59,826
Deuce, it's over between us.

959
01:11:03,300 --> 01:11:04,222
Listen.

960
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:08,716
Those shots hurt like hell.
Could you at least hear me out?

961
01:11:09,100 --> 01:11:10,800
Well, I don't know how much
you charge by the hour...

962
01:11:10,962 --> 01:11:11,940
but you have one minute.

963
01:11:12,800 --> 01:11:15,576
Okay. I deserved that.

964
01:11:17,960 --> 01:11:20,117
I should have told you
right from the start...

965
01:11:21,400 --> 01:11:22,418
but I was afraid.

966
01:11:23,700 --> 01:11:24,878
Afraid of what?

967
01:11:25,500 --> 01:11:27,774
Afraid that a girl
as wonderful as you...

968
01:11:28,550 --> 01:11:31,367
could never fall for a guy
who cleans fish tanks.

969
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:34,302
'Cause that's who I really am.

970
01:11:35,500 --> 01:11:37,700
This whole gigolo thing
was just a mistake...

971
01:11:39,100 --> 01:11:40,655
but I'm glad it happened.

972
01:11:42,100 --> 01:11:43,798
'Cause I never would have met you.

973
01:11:45,300 --> 01:11:47,277
I never would have known
what love was.

974
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:49,846
I'm sorry.

975
01:11:50,500 --> 01:11:51,283
I'm not perfect.

976
01:11:55,850 --> 01:11:57,641
I'm not perfect either.

977
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:00,907
Yes, you are.

978
01:12:02,200 --> 01:12:04,081
You're perfect in every way.

979
01:12:05,300 --> 01:12:07,087
I knew it the moment I met you.

980
01:12:13,450 --> 01:12:14,249
Kate...

981
01:12:16,300 --> 01:12:19,082
"You have a smile
that could melt an iceberg.

982
01:12:20,100 --> 01:12:23,331
Your lips are as sweet as honey.

983
01:12:24,536 --> 01:12:26,179
You may only have one leg...

984
01:12:27,400 --> 01:12:30,429
but it's the most beautiful leg
in the world."

985
01:12:37,500 --> 01:12:40,123
Are you kissing me?
'Cause I can't feel a thing.

986
01:12:42,550 --> 01:12:43,971
...now boarding at gate 53.

987
01:12:44,350 --> 01:12:47,231
Flight 14 to Sydney, Australia,
is now boarding at gate..

988
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:49,292
I've never done this
in 12 hours before...

989
01:12:49,800 --> 01:12:51,836
and I'm not responsible
if the seals leak, Deuce.

990
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:56,144
Shit! Shit cabinet!

991
01:13:05,500 --> 01:13:07,222
Come on, Deucey.
Put the fish in the tank already.

992
01:13:07,500 --> 01:13:09,059
Antoine's plane
landed 20 minutes ago.

993
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:12,429
I think we're gonna be okay.

994
01:13:15,600 --> 01:13:17,251
Could you step
this way, please?

995
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:21,392
Is it time to put
the big guy in yet?

996
01:13:23,800 --> 01:13:25,262
Give him another minute.
Temperature's not right.

997
01:13:34,700 --> 01:13:37,017
Spread them again, please.

998
01:13:40,500 --> 01:13:41,758
Okay, we can put
the last fish in.

999
01:13:42,500 --> 01:13:45,454
- Looks like we pulled it off, kid.
- Time for some tequila!

1000
01:13:52,600 --> 01:13:53,917
Margaritas, anybody?

1001
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:15,000
I need...

1002
01:14:15,270 --> 01:14:17,808
Chinese tail bar lionfish.

1003
01:14:20,800 --> 01:14:22,681
- Seven hundred, eight hundred.
- Where'd you get all that money?

1004
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:26,827
- Friends.
- Yeah, right. Anything else?

1005
01:14:28,500 --> 01:14:30,187
On second thought, you'd better
give me some of those sea snails.

1006
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:01,044
So, uh, how was your trip?

1007
01:15:02,800 --> 01:15:04,040
Very good...

1008
01:15:04,900 --> 01:15:06,165
till about three hours ago.

1009
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:08,701
Yeah? What happened?

1010
01:15:09,600 --> 01:15:10,514
I don't want to talk about it.

1011
01:15:14,500 --> 01:15:15,269
The place looks good.

1012
01:15:18,200 --> 01:15:19,400
Good to be home.

1013
01:15:19,700 --> 01:15:21,041
Well, I should take off
so you can relax.

1014
01:15:21,500 --> 01:15:22,713
There's something
you're not telling me?

1015
01:15:26,200 --> 01:15:30,398
Yeah. I put your mail
on the nightstand.

1016
01:15:34,855 --> 01:15:36,535
Right.

1017
01:15:40,900 --> 01:15:41,734
What the hell is this?

1018
01:15:42,500 --> 01:15:43,711
A chocolate margarita.

1019
01:15:44,600 --> 01:15:47,118
- You've been having a party?
- It was, uh, more like, uh...

1020
01:15:48,100 --> 01:15:49,610
a "welcome home" thing, really.

1021
01:15:52,300 --> 01:15:54,043
I guess I could really
use one right now.

1022
01:16:04,300 --> 01:16:05,340
Spicy.

1023
01:16:08,400 --> 01:16:10,074
- I should probably go.
- My fish.

1024
01:16:13,500 --> 01:16:15,000
They look smaller.

1025
01:16:17,250 --> 01:16:19,155
Sometimes
when they're, uh, sick...

1026
01:16:20,600 --> 01:16:21,724
they'll shrink.

1027
01:16:24,400 --> 01:16:25,878
Hey, fishy, fishy, fishy, fishy.

1028
01:16:26,250 --> 01:16:29,039
Hey, fishy, fishy, fishy,
fishy, fishy, fishy.

1029
01:16:29,850 --> 01:16:31,522
Hey, fishy, fishy, fishy, fishy.

1030
01:16:51,500 --> 01:16:55,108
I did man-whore for a little bit,
but none of your clients.

1031
01:16:55,350 --> 01:16:56,585
None of them.

1032
01:16:57,000 --> 01:16:59,344
I know an aquarium guy
who can fix all of this.

1033
01:16:59,800 --> 01:17:01,989
- He's a little expensive..
- Ha!

1034
01:17:02,100 --> 01:17:03,335
Deuce!

1035
01:17:09,500 --> 01:17:10,900
No!

1036
01:17:35,050 --> 01:17:36,619
- Deuce!
- No!

1037
01:17:59,500 --> 01:18:02,513
Hey! Tough guy.
What do you think of this?

1038
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:05,500
You're busted.

1039
01:18:07,200 --> 01:18:08,207
What's goin' on out here?

1040
01:18:10,200 --> 01:18:11,611
I can see!

1041
01:18:14,900 --> 01:18:17,667
You're black.
I knew it.
