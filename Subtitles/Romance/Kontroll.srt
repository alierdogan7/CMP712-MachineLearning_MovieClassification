1
00:00:00,735 --> 00:00:04,250
The film you are about to see has
been directed by a young man,

2
00:00:04,335 --> 00:00:08,214
who is a friend of mine, although
we haven't known each other long.

3
00:00:08,295 --> 00:00:11,093
As he explained it to me
during our long discussions,

4
00:00:11,175 --> 00:00:14,724
he is particularly interested in
the struggle between Good and Evil.

5
00:00:14,815 --> 00:00:17,807
What he presents
in his feature film is fiction,

6
00:00:17,895 --> 00:00:20,090
a fictitious underground world.

7
00:00:20,175 --> 00:00:23,884
Neither the location, nor the events
that take place there,

8
00:00:23,975 --> 00:00:28,491
nor the characters can be related
to the Budapest Public Transport Co.,

9
00:00:28,575 --> 00:00:30,531
as they reflect ideas
of universal claim.

10
00:00:30,615 --> 00:00:35,006
Many have warned me against letting
him shoot in the Budapest underground.

11
00:00:35,095 --> 00:00:39,452
They were afraid that the events
and characters of the film

12
00:00:39,535 --> 00:00:42,208
might discredit our company.

13
00:00:42,295 --> 00:00:44,251
l see it differently.

14
00:00:44,335 --> 00:00:48,010
l am proud that we've been
able to help a film director

15
00:00:48,095 --> 00:00:51,292
to make his first film
by letting him use

16
00:00:51,375 --> 00:00:54,924
the underground
with its special atmosphere.

17
00:00:55,015 --> 00:00:57,927
l am convinced that the viewers
will be able

18
00:00:58,015 --> 00:01:00,734
to separate the locations
from the story

19
00:01:00,815 --> 00:01:05,411
and will not identify the characters
with our ticket inspectors

20
00:01:05,495 --> 00:01:09,283
as the world in which the story is
set is obviously symbolic.

21
00:01:18,175 --> 00:01:26,844
KONTROLL

22
00:01:46,215 --> 00:01:48,524
Damn.

23
00:02:51,415 --> 00:02:54,930
Metro party

24
00:05:09,815 --> 00:05:12,488
Hey, man, you're bleeding.

25
00:05:28,975 --> 00:05:30,727
- What did you say to me?
- Please, no trouble.

26
00:05:31,495 --> 00:05:33,725
What did you say?

27
00:05:37,055 --> 00:05:39,808
Ticket or pass, please.

28
00:05:47,935 --> 00:05:50,290
What did you say?

29
00:05:51,255 --> 00:05:54,372
l said your nose is bleeding.

30
00:06:09,655 --> 00:06:12,169
What are you staring at?

31
00:06:27,135 --> 00:06:31,048
- That's the sickest thing
l've ever seen. - What?

32
00:06:31,295 --> 00:06:34,890
How can you eat that shit
this early in the morning?

33
00:06:34,975 --> 00:06:36,852
What do you care?

34
00:06:36,935 --> 00:06:41,531
l'm just saying that all
that grease is not good for you.

35
00:06:41,615 --> 00:06:44,448
All those saturated fats are
congesting your arteries,

36
00:06:44,535 --> 00:06:47,368
blocking the flow of blood
to and from your heart.

37
00:06:47,455 --> 00:06:50,572
Listen, l'm heaving breakfast,
would you let me eat in peace.

38
00:06:50,655 --> 00:06:53,328
lt's your heart, you do with it
what you want.

39
00:06:53,415 --> 00:06:55,610
That's right.
ls it any of your business?

40
00:06:55,695 --> 00:07:00,450
No. lt's none of my business
if your heart explodes.

41
00:07:00,535 --> 00:07:02,366
lt's yours, let it explode!

42
00:07:02,455 --> 00:07:04,923
Do l give you grief for your
stinky cigarettes? No.

43
00:07:05,015 --> 00:07:07,449
This is what you do all the time.

44
00:07:07,535 --> 00:07:09,332
Calm down. l meant well.

45
00:07:09,415 --> 00:07:11,929
There are people
who simply cannot be helped.

46
00:07:12,015 --> 00:07:15,564
- He's doing it all the time... - l only
meant well, no need to overreact.

47
00:07:15,655 --> 00:07:17,054
l'm not overreacting!

48
00:07:17,135 --> 00:07:19,490
Don't stick your nose
into other people's shit.

49
00:07:19,575 --> 00:07:23,124
- He gets angry and overreacts!
- Mind your own business, will you?

50
00:07:23,215 --> 00:07:27,891
- Why don't you get off my back.
- Didn't l tell you? He overreacts.

51
00:07:27,975 --> 00:07:31,729
You have to be the smart one.
No matter what you...

52
00:07:48,535 --> 00:07:52,369
- What's the matter with him?
- Nothing. He's just sleeping.

53
00:07:52,455 --> 00:07:55,128
- Let him sleep it off.
- He'll choke...

54
00:07:55,215 --> 00:07:58,412
He won't. Leave him alone.
Let him sleep...

55
00:07:58,495 --> 00:08:01,328
This just proves my point.

56
00:08:02,175 --> 00:08:04,325
He's become a product
of his environment.

57
00:08:04,415 --> 00:08:07,009
lf you're surrounded
by aggressive people

58
00:08:07,095 --> 00:08:11,885
- you run a risk of also becoming one.
- lt's like a vicious circle.

59
00:08:11,975 --> 00:08:14,205
Exactly. Look at Muki.

60
00:08:20,815 --> 00:08:23,124
What's this smell?

61
00:08:23,695 --> 00:08:26,004
Move your ass!

62
00:08:34,655 --> 00:08:37,852
l almost had the little fucker
but he got away.

63
00:08:39,495 --> 00:08:42,851
- He spray you again?
- Not this time.

64
00:08:45,815 --> 00:08:48,852
- He didn't see me coming.
- Why didn't you get him then?

65
00:08:48,935 --> 00:08:52,848
l tried. l already had him.
But he noticed me.

66
00:08:52,935 --> 00:08:56,894
He's like the fucking devil, he's
got eyes in the back of his head.

67
00:08:56,975 --> 00:08:59,853
- That's it?
- That's it. What did you expect?

68
00:08:59,935 --> 00:09:02,529
Who're you talking about?

69
00:09:04,215 --> 00:09:08,003
- The runner man. Bootsie!
- What's a Bootsie?

70
00:09:08,095 --> 00:09:11,405
- How long have you been
down here? - Two weeks.

71
00:09:11,495 --> 00:09:14,293
- And you haven't run into him yet?
- No.

72
00:09:16,935 --> 00:09:19,244
Where's Bulcsú?

73
00:09:19,535 --> 00:09:22,003
- Oh, shit.
- Who's this Bootsie?

74
00:09:22,255 --> 00:09:25,247
Hang on.
Who's this Bootsie?

75
00:09:31,375 --> 00:09:34,208
Wait! Do you hear?

76
00:10:11,255 --> 00:10:13,450
Listen up!

77
00:10:14,215 --> 00:10:16,854
l said, listen up!

78
00:10:27,135 --> 00:10:30,605
Gonzó's crew: west line.

79
00:10:30,695 --> 00:10:33,812
Tamás: upper part of the north line.

80
00:10:35,055 --> 00:10:39,094
Csaba and his mates will ride
the trains on the east line.

81
00:10:39,975 --> 00:10:43,365
Róbert will get down to business
on the west line.

82
00:10:44,375 --> 00:10:48,254
Csaba and crew will occupy
the upper part of the north line.

83
00:10:48,335 --> 00:10:51,452
Tamás to the upper part
of the north line.

84
00:10:51,535 --> 00:10:54,766
- Where have you been?
- l overslept.

85
00:10:55,895 --> 00:10:58,011
Muki?

86
00:10:58,895 --> 00:11:01,363
Róbert, you take your men...

87
00:11:01,975 --> 00:11:04,011
l'm sorry to disturb you.

88
00:11:05,215 --> 00:11:08,844
Why don't you monkeys go work
the bus lines with the other losers.

89
00:11:11,895 --> 00:11:15,968
You guys are on probation
so have the common fucking sense

90
00:11:16,935 --> 00:11:20,405
to keep your traps shut
while l'm talking.

91
00:11:20,815 --> 00:11:23,283
For that matter where the fuck
is Muki?

92
00:11:23,375 --> 00:11:27,971
- That's just what l was asking.
- l don't need your smartass remarks.

93
00:11:32,215 --> 00:11:35,571
Take whatever's left of your crew
and work the south line.

94
00:11:39,855 --> 00:11:41,573
Everybody shut up.

95
00:11:43,535 --> 00:11:46,607
We had another jumper last night.

96
00:11:56,895 --> 00:12:00,285
The suits in the main office
are very upset.

97
00:12:00,375 --> 00:12:03,367
That was the 7th this month.

98
00:12:04,095 --> 00:12:07,371
The main office is concerned
how this makes the metro look.

99
00:12:07,735 --> 00:12:11,853
lt's not our fault if people want to
jump under trains and not ride them...

100
00:12:14,375 --> 00:12:18,254
Since there is no official policy
as of yet, it's a little tricky.

101
00:12:18,335 --> 00:12:20,724
We've been asked to help out.

102
00:12:25,175 --> 00:12:28,690
lf one of you witnesses
someone jumping

103
00:12:28,775 --> 00:12:33,212
or about to jump,
try to stop him.

104
00:12:34,735 --> 00:12:37,249
What the fuck does that mean?

105
00:12:38,375 --> 00:12:40,889
By the way, image.

106
00:12:41,695 --> 00:12:45,813
The suits have decided
to introduce a new uniform

107
00:12:47,735 --> 00:12:50,852
to improve the standard
of elegance.

108
00:12:51,095 --> 00:12:54,087
This is what it looks like.
No more armbands,

109
00:12:54,295 --> 00:12:56,763
there's a detachable
shoulder strap,

110
00:12:56,855 --> 00:12:59,244
here's the badge

111
00:12:59,335 --> 00:13:02,884
and the lD card with the photo
goes here in the holder.

112
00:13:03,335 --> 00:13:08,648
One of our crews will have the honor
to be allowed to try the new uniform.

113
00:13:08,815 --> 00:13:12,649
And this crew is the best crew,
Gonzó's!

114
00:13:13,455 --> 00:13:15,605
Bravo, Gonzó!

115
00:13:22,575 --> 00:13:25,408
What are you waiting for? Get out!

116
00:13:39,855 --> 00:13:42,130
Elite commando...

117
00:13:55,855 --> 00:13:57,413
Laci!

118
00:13:59,655 --> 00:14:01,373
Yes?

119
00:14:02,135 --> 00:14:03,887
You doing all right?

120
00:14:04,735 --> 00:14:08,444
Great, just looking forward
to getting back to work.

121
00:14:09,495 --> 00:14:11,213
You sure?

122
00:14:17,455 --> 00:14:19,286
Bulcsú!

123
00:14:23,335 --> 00:14:26,964
What, you gonna work
from your desk?

124
00:14:27,855 --> 00:14:30,972
Get the fuck out of here!

125
00:14:54,135 --> 00:14:56,729
What's new, Béla?

126
00:14:57,255 --> 00:14:59,894
How you doing, Muki?

127
00:15:00,095 --> 00:15:04,725
This is a shit of a day.
And it hasn't even started yet.

128
00:15:05,695 --> 00:15:08,653
You have something on your face.

129
00:15:08,975 --> 00:15:12,047
- Here.
- What's this?

130
00:15:13,655 --> 00:15:16,123
A commercial.

131
00:15:18,215 --> 00:15:20,809
You seen my crew?

132
00:15:20,895 --> 00:15:23,250
Just Gonzó and his guys.

133
00:15:23,335 --> 00:15:28,125
Man, l don't get that asshole.
Licking his hair along the way.

134
00:15:28,815 --> 00:15:31,693
Here he's king.

135
00:15:31,775 --> 00:15:34,812
You know how he got his job?

136
00:15:35,815 --> 00:15:37,373
Yeah.

137
00:15:37,455 --> 00:15:40,174
l hate people like him.

138
00:15:43,895 --> 00:15:46,614
More of them than there are of us.

139
00:15:48,615 --> 00:15:52,244
Like his shit smells
better than mine.

140
00:15:52,335 --> 00:15:57,011
Tell me, son. You like
the smell of your own shit?

141
00:15:59,175 --> 00:16:03,293
l gotta find my guys.
Keep rollin' Béla.

142
00:16:03,695 --> 00:16:05,765
Still rolling.

143
00:16:09,255 --> 00:16:13,453
Attention, please. Smoking is
forbidden in the metro system.

144
00:16:32,935 --> 00:16:36,405
Get in or get out.
l don't have all day.

145
00:18:27,295 --> 00:18:30,253
...you peel the onion,
chop it up real fine...

146
00:18:30,375 --> 00:18:33,412
then you fry it in oil
until golden brown,

147
00:18:34,975 --> 00:18:38,934
add some paprika, but you must be
really careful with it

148
00:18:39,015 --> 00:18:42,564
because if you put it in real hot oil
it will burn and becomes bitter...

149
00:18:42,655 --> 00:18:46,648
then you add the pig's trotters
and water...

150
00:18:46,735 --> 00:18:50,284
l never thought there were
jobs worse than ours.

151
00:18:50,375 --> 00:18:56,450
...and you top it up with water
in the end to make it nice and juicy.

152
00:18:58,935 --> 00:19:01,324
Don't look, son.

153
00:19:14,655 --> 00:19:19,251
Never mind. You can even
piss on me if you like.

154
00:19:23,055 --> 00:19:26,286
Go ahead, puke over my shoulder.

155
00:19:27,295 --> 00:19:30,128
We'll discuss this later.

156
00:19:34,215 --> 00:19:36,775
Here comes the Gestapo.

157
00:19:37,455 --> 00:19:40,492
l didn't know what was missing.

158
00:19:40,575 --> 00:19:43,248
l'll tell them a little bird
shat all over me.

159
00:19:59,295 --> 00:20:01,286
You?

160
00:20:03,535 --> 00:20:07,448
- We were about to work the train.
- And? Did you see what happened?

161
00:20:07,535 --> 00:20:11,323
- We heard some screams. - Then
what the hell are you doing here?

162
00:20:11,415 --> 00:20:14,168
You guys want to talk to them?

163
00:20:35,295 --> 00:20:39,004
- You think he heard me?
- Who? - The paramedic.

164
00:20:39,095 --> 00:20:42,849
- What do you care if he heard you.
- lt could always get worse.

165
00:20:42,935 --> 00:20:46,211
- How's that?
- You could be the jumper.

166
00:20:51,055 --> 00:20:53,410
Muki's here.

167
00:20:53,495 --> 00:20:54,894
Good morning.

168
00:20:59,055 --> 00:21:03,173
You skipped the bufe
this morning again.

169
00:21:03,255 --> 00:21:06,565
- l overslept. - Overslept!
l tried to call you last night.

170
00:21:06,655 --> 00:21:08,293
l was out.

171
00:21:08,375 --> 00:21:14,007
''l was out.'' Good for you.

00:24:29,255 --> 00:24:32,053
You're wearing it upside down.

209

00:28:01,335 --> 00:28:04,008
Are you a cop?
An insurance agent?

234
00:28:04,135 --> 00:28:06,444
- Oh, God...

235
00:28:06,535 --> 00:28:10,323
-What ticket? -You haven't got one?

You have a group rate or not?

00:28:35,415 --> 00:28:38,373
- This is the wrong zone, my friend.
- So it is.

243
00:28:38,455 --> 00:28:42,050
Does it say anywhere that this
is a sleeping car?

244
00:28:42,135 --> 00:28:45,525
- Does it?
- Would you like it to be?

245
00:28:45,615 --> 00:28:48,891
Your sweater is cute,

246
00:28:48,975 --> 00:28:50,727
Let's see your ticket, then...

247

00:29:00,375 --> 00:29:05,324
l don't want the girls, show me
your ticket or pass or get off.

252
00:29:05,415 --> 00:29:06,894
Are you really such an idiot?

00:29:53,815 --> 00:29:55,453
You're the boss?

00:30:05,695 --> 00:30:08,732
- Should l bring a secretary with me?
- Just make sure she has a ticket.

271
00:30:08,815 --> 00:30:12,854
- You rotten informer. - What
informer? What are you talking about?

272
00:30:12,935 --> 00:30:15,244
- Who are you watching, eh?
- And you?

273
00:30:15,335 --> 00:30:20,204

lt is forbidden to bring dogs here.

l haven't seen you... - What?

289
00:31:48,295 --> 00:31:50,934
You guys don't usually say
excuse me.

290
00:31:57,295 --> 00:32:00,605
But exceptions prove the rule.

291
00:32:04,775 --> 00:32:07,573
Besides, l never buy a ticket.

292
00:32:13,135 --> 00:32:15,968
Did the bear have a ticket?

293
00:32:17,175 --> 00:32:18,164
Yeah.

294
00:32:18,615 --> 00:32:22,733
- Who are you?
- My name's Bootsie.

295
00:32:26,095 --> 00:32:29,246
Fuck you...
l'm blind! l'm blind!

296
00:32:35,575 --> 00:32:37,770
You motherfucker.

Are you sure you're all right?
Tibor!

302
00:33:10,855 --> 00:33:13,528

308
00:35:45,335 --> 00:35:49,851
The damned thing about it is
that we didn't stand a chance.

309
00:35:50,215 --> 00:35:55,369
We're just like the first class
detective guys, damn it.

310
00:35:55,975 --> 00:35:57,886
And that's it.

311
00:35:57,975 --> 00:36:01,684

lt won't hurt so bad tomorrow.

How the fuck am l going to explain
it to the company doctor?

00:36:25,895 --> 00:36:29,205
lt's broken... look... it's dead.

00:36:38,775 --> 00:36:40,811
Listen...

318
00:36:45,295 --> 00:36:47,650

320
00:36:58,135 --> 00:36:59,807
Wait, wait.

00:37:22,975 --> 00:37:25,808
l told you that faggot was

00:37:39,295 --> 00:37:41,763
He ain't gonna show.

- He ain't gonna show.

324
00:38:18,295 --> 00:38:22,686
- l thought l'd see you here tonight.
- l'd never miss this show.

325
00:38:23,015 --> 00:38:26,894
This is C, this is Tibi,
one of the new guys.

326
00:38:37,295 --> 00:38:39,365
Hang on. You hear?

327

Listen, wait...

328
00:38:44,455 --> 00:38:46,446
What's C?

329
00:38:47,655 --> 00:38:49,054
lt's my name.

330
00:38:51,695 --> 00:38:54,653
We can still call this off.

331
00:38:55,815 --> 00:38:58,045
Fuck you.

332
00:39:00,255 --> 00:39:04,453
- But what does it stand for?
- Cripple.

00:39:06,055 --> 00:39:07,454
Cripple.

335
00:39:16,215 --> 00:39:20,811
- Your laces. - What?

336
00:39:22,775 --> 00:39:25,573
Cripple. What a fucked up name.

337
00:39:25,655 --> 00:39:27,771
lt's just a nickname.

338
00:39:27,855 --> 00:39:30,688
Why did you get a name like that?

339
00:39:31,535 --> 00:39:35,369
Because l haven't got any toes
on my left foot.

340
00:39:38,975 --> 00:39:41,443
You born that way?

341
00:39:44,615 --> 00:39:46,014
No.

342
00:39:51,255 --> 00:39:54,053
We should get into the last car.

343
00:40:41,255 --> 00:40:43,928
Listen, tell me, what's all this?

344
00:40:44,895 --> 00:40:48,444
- What did Bulcsú tell you?
- Nothing.

345
00:40:48,535 --> 00:40:51,208
That it's some kind of race.

346
00:40:51,295 --> 00:40:54,412
More like Russian roulette.

347
00:40:57,175 --> 00:41:01,054
And where are they right now?

348
00:41:02,655 --> 00:41:07,046
Somewhere behind us.
Running behind the train.

349
00:41:08,815 --> 00:41:12,603
The second our train pulled out,
they jumped onto the tracks

350
00:41:12,695 --> 00:41:15,209
and started to run after us.

351
00:41:15,295 --> 00:41:18,526
lt's not easy because the ground is
covered with tubes and cables

352
00:41:18,615 --> 00:41:20,128
and the tracks are there, too.

353
00:41:20,215 --> 00:41:23,651
Your lungs fill with graphite powder
and you can't breathe.

354
00:41:23,735 --> 00:41:26,693
The problem is the next train.

355
00:41:28,535 --> 00:41:30,924
Wait, wait, wait...

356
00:41:31,935 --> 00:41:35,814
- This is the last train.
- The last passenger train.

357
00:41:35,895 --> 00:41:39,365
We still have
the midnight express behind us.

358
00:41:43,375 --> 00:41:46,845
The midnight express. What's that?

359
00:41:46,975 --> 00:41:49,170
lt's the real last train.

360
00:41:49,255 --> 00:41:52,964
lt's the last train
that heads back to the depot.

361
00:41:53,535 --> 00:41:56,447
- So you're saying...
- That's right.

362
00:41:56,535 --> 00:42:00,050
They got another train
coming from behind.

363
00:42:00,135 --> 00:42:03,207
The real problem is
that the midnight express

364
00:42:03,295 --> 00:42:06,605
doesn't stop at any stations.

365
00:42:06,815 --> 00:42:08,806
Hang on. And who wins?

366
00:42:08,895 --> 00:42:12,092
What do you think?
Whoever comes out first.

367
00:42:20,175 --> 00:42:22,769
Listen man, what now?

368
00:42:26,175 --> 00:42:29,247
We smoke a cigarette.

369
00:42:43,615 --> 00:42:46,129
Give me a cigarette.

370
00:43:24,855 --> 00:43:29,565
DANGER, ENTRY PROHlBlTED

371
00:43:47,655 --> 00:43:51,409
Holy shit!

372
00:43:52,655 --> 00:43:54,054
Shit!

373
00:43:55,815 --> 00:43:59,012
You're king! You're king!

374
00:44:12,655 --> 00:44:15,453
l'm going home.

375
00:44:17,415 --> 00:44:19,531
What?

376
00:44:19,615 --> 00:44:21,890
Bulcsú!

377
00:46:20,455 --> 00:46:22,446
Wake up!

378
00:46:26,295 --> 00:46:30,208
- What are you doing here?
- l wanna show you something.

379
00:46:31,295 --> 00:46:33,092
Come.

380
00:46:54,935 --> 00:46:56,493
Come!

381
00:47:49,335 --> 00:47:52,645
What did you want to show me?

382
00:47:59,055 --> 00:48:01,285
There.

383
00:49:49,375 --> 00:49:52,367
Will you sit down? Please.

384
00:49:52,455 --> 00:49:56,130
Thank you. That's really kind of you.

385
00:50:39,175 --> 00:50:41,450
- Excuse me, good morning, lady.
- Good morning.

386
00:50:41,535 --> 00:50:45,448
- Ticket or pass, please. - Get lost,
l'm busy. - Hang on! Excuse me.

387
00:50:46,055 --> 00:50:49,684
- Good morning.
- l don't fucking believe this.

388
00:50:49,775 --> 00:50:54,087
l can't believe you find me again.
Can't you see we're on a job?

389
00:50:54,175 --> 00:50:58,726
- The dog's ticket, please.
- Don't you ever point at the dog.

390
00:51:00,895 --> 00:51:03,807
Come on, Professor,
what's the matter?

391
00:51:03,895 --> 00:51:06,648
Nothing,
l'm just checking if it's okay.

392
00:51:06,735 --> 00:51:11,013
What the fuck do you have to
look at it? lt's not okay.

393
00:51:11,095 --> 00:51:14,849
Let me see, okay?
Don't tell me if it's okay or not.

394
00:51:14,935 --> 00:51:17,005
Of course, it's not.

395
00:51:17,095 --> 00:51:19,086
- Leave me alone.
- Lady. l'm just doing my job.

396
00:51:19,175 --> 00:51:23,088
Fuck you and your job.
Who the fuck cares about your job?

397
00:51:23,175 --> 00:51:27,487
- Your dog's supposed to be muzzled.
- What are you talking about?

398
00:51:27,575 --> 00:51:31,409
You're dog's not allowed to ride
the metro without a muzzle.

399
00:51:31,495 --> 00:51:33,292
This is an international story...

400
00:51:33,375 --> 00:51:37,288
Look at the photo or don't you
know how to look at a photo?

401
00:51:37,375 --> 00:51:40,048
Like this.
No date.

402
00:51:40,135 --> 00:51:45,573
Thanks for your help. Teach me
what to do with the passengers?

403
00:51:45,655 --> 00:51:50,570
- You want me to call the cops?
- l'll tell them you touched me. Yes!

404
00:51:50,655 --> 00:51:53,533
- l'll tell them you grabbed my tits.
- What?

405
00:51:53,615 --> 00:51:56,254
Yeah.
l'll tell them you grabbed my tits.

406
00:51:56,375 --> 00:52:01,085
Here, you little punk.
Suck my ass you faggot.

407
00:52:01,175 --> 00:52:04,247
Same to you, too, madam.
And have a nice day.

408
00:52:04,855 --> 00:52:08,973
- l can't believe that l can't get it
out. - Why can't you get it out?

409
00:52:09,055 --> 00:52:11,205
You might as well
keep it in a bank vault.

410
00:52:11,295 --> 00:52:15,334
Look at this. D'you think l don't buy a
ticket because l haven't got the cash?

411
00:52:15,415 --> 00:52:17,883
Why, then don't you buy a ticket?

412
00:52:17,975 --> 00:52:22,287
On principle. l'm not going to carry
pieces of paper on me.

413
00:52:22,375 --> 00:52:25,253
This is how you fucking take it out.

414
00:52:25,335 --> 00:52:29,692
- Like this, see?
- You're incredible.

415
00:52:30,575 --> 00:52:31,974
This is yours.

416
00:52:32,055 --> 00:52:36,367
Okay. 5 minutes with the little one.
ln peace and quiet.

417
00:52:36,455 --> 00:52:39,925
She'll do it happily, she enjoys it,
l swear, that's no bullshit.

418
00:52:40,015 --> 00:52:42,734
l don't want the girl.
l want your lD card.

419
00:52:42,815 --> 00:52:47,286
- Take it out, take a look...
- That's what l'm doing.

420
00:52:47,375 --> 00:52:51,129
Here. l told you it wasn't okay.

421
00:52:51,215 --> 00:52:55,254
By the way, he hasn't put
his name on it.

422
00:52:55,335 --> 00:52:58,372
- Trying to cheat.
- No, there's no name on it.

423
00:52:58,695 --> 00:53:03,132
- What's this?
- lt's my p...p-p...p-p...

424
00:53:06,215 --> 00:53:09,810
- l asked you a simple question.
- l... l... l...

425
00:53:09,895 --> 00:53:12,967
Not this year. Fucking hell, no.
Last year.

426
00:53:13,055 --> 00:53:15,808
Who was operated on
last year? You or l?

427
00:53:15,895 --> 00:53:18,773
- Excuse me...
- Just a moment,

428
00:53:18,855 --> 00:53:23,406
don't be so impatient,
we're on a job here.

429
00:53:23,775 --> 00:53:27,688
- Stop.
- Shut up! l'll call my husband.

430
00:53:27,775 --> 00:53:32,803
Call your hubby. Send him over.
Send God over. l'm king here.

431
00:53:32,895 --> 00:53:36,604
l'll bite his head off throat
if he doesn't have a ticket.

432
00:53:36,695 --> 00:53:38,925
Tickets or passes, please.

433
00:53:39,655 --> 00:53:42,852
That's an ancient trick.
Your ticket please.

434
00:53:42,935 --> 00:53:45,165
Tibor, you mustn't lose control.

435
00:53:45,255 --> 00:53:48,292
This little shit grabbed me, there!

436
00:53:52,495 --> 00:53:55,851
- What now?
- Chill out, l'll talk... l'll talk to him.

437
00:53:55,975 --> 00:53:59,650
- Chill out, let's discuss it.
- Shut up and scram!

438
00:53:59,735 --> 00:54:02,807
- What's the matter with you?
- There-there-there...

439
00:54:02,895 --> 00:54:04,692
- l know it's your pass.
- l... l... l...

440
00:54:04,775 --> 00:54:06,652
lt's not good here.

441
00:54:08,815 --> 00:54:11,693
Your name?
What's your name?

442
00:54:11,815 --> 00:54:13,771
What's your name?

443
00:54:18,215 --> 00:54:20,604
But...but... but...

444
00:54:21,455 --> 00:54:27,451
- What do you want with a pass
that's no good here? - Back... back...

445
00:54:27,535 --> 00:54:29,890
Here... on the back...

446
00:54:29,975 --> 00:54:31,374
Tickets or passes please...

447
00:54:31,455 --> 00:54:34,527
Leave me alone.
l have to catch the train.

448
00:54:34,615 --> 00:54:38,608
- Madam, l'll call the cops.
- l'll put such a curse on you.

449
00:54:38,735 --> 00:54:42,125
- Okay, but give me your ticket.
- Shall l put a curse on you?

450
00:54:45,655 --> 00:54:47,771
Ticket or pass, please.

451
00:54:47,855 --> 00:54:50,289
Please, show me your ticket...

452
00:54:50,655 --> 00:54:52,646
l'm patient...

453
00:54:53,055 --> 00:54:56,365
Are you fucking crazy?
Are you messing with me?

454
00:54:56,455 --> 00:55:00,334
This... this... this... is... my...

455
00:55:00,415 --> 00:55:03,805
lt's people like you
who make me crazy!

456
00:55:05,055 --> 00:55:08,013
Stop fucking with me!
Get outta here!

457
00:55:08,095 --> 00:55:12,725
l'll cut off your hand
and stick it up your ass!

458
00:55:13,375 --> 00:55:15,570
Tickets or passes, please...

459
00:55:17,055 --> 00:55:18,613
- Excuse me, sorry...
- Nerd.

460
00:55:18,695 --> 00:55:22,449
lt's people like you
that make this job so tough!

461
00:55:26,415 --> 00:55:28,485
lt's people like...

462
00:55:33,095 --> 00:55:35,655
lt's the grease.
Animals don't eat grease.

463
00:55:35,735 --> 00:55:37,566
Or at least not this much.

464
00:55:37,655 --> 00:55:39,691
Dirty job.

465
00:55:44,455 --> 00:55:46,730
- Sorry.
- Sorry...

466
00:55:47,815 --> 00:55:50,568
Let's put him
on the bench over here.

467
00:56:20,015 --> 00:56:22,245
- What's up?
- Bulcsú... !

468
00:56:23,255 --> 00:56:26,964
Bulcsú!
You don't remember me? Sorry.

469
00:56:27,575 --> 00:56:29,372
- Hello, Feri...
- Hi.

470
00:56:29,495 --> 00:56:32,532
You look horrible.
l haven't seen you for ages.

471
00:56:35,135 --> 00:56:37,695
- l think that guy's talking to you.
- No.

472
00:56:37,775 --> 00:56:40,972
He is a ticket control officer.
l haven't got a ticket. Do you?

473
00:56:41,055 --> 00:56:44,365
No. They just like to harass people.

474
00:56:44,495 --> 00:56:49,285
- You okay? You just seem anxious.
- No.

475
00:56:49,375 --> 00:56:51,206
Okay, then.

476
00:56:51,535 --> 00:56:54,413
- You getting on this one?
- No, the other one...

477
00:56:54,495 --> 00:56:58,090
Never mind, l have some time.
l'll ride with you so we can catch up.

478
00:56:58,175 --> 00:57:00,245
Yes, great...

479
00:57:05,295 --> 00:57:09,607
- So where did you disappear to?
You been abroad? - What?

480
00:57:09,695 --> 00:57:12,607
Working? Or just traveling?

481
00:57:14,855 --> 00:57:19,326
- Yeah, working, traveling.
- Man, that must be great.

482
00:57:21,295 --> 00:57:23,855
- So you working there?
- Where?

483
00:57:23,935 --> 00:57:27,291
- What do you mean where?
Abroad... - No.

484
00:57:27,575 --> 00:57:31,614
So you're here in the city?
l'm just asking because

485
00:57:31,695 --> 00:57:35,244
l haven't heard your name
floating around lately.

486
00:57:41,735 --> 00:57:44,966
- How about you?
- Me?

487
00:57:47,935 --> 00:57:50,972
l'm the head of the team.

488
00:57:51,735 --> 00:57:54,533
Congratulations.
l mean it.

489
00:57:54,615 --> 00:57:58,164
lt was easy to get without you there.

490
00:58:00,135 --> 00:58:02,126
- Can l ask you something?
- Go ahead.

491
00:58:02,215 --> 00:58:05,571
- lt's none of my business, if you...
- No... no...

492
00:58:05,655 --> 00:58:09,807
...if you don't want to talk
about it, that's cool.

493
00:58:09,895 --> 00:58:12,489
Your project... your work...

494
00:58:12,575 --> 00:58:15,885
There hasn't been anything
close since then.

495
00:58:17,975 --> 00:58:21,490
l have all of it,
l saved every scrap of paper.

496
00:58:21,975 --> 00:58:24,170
Why?

497
00:58:24,495 --> 00:58:27,373
ln case you came back.

498
00:58:28,415 --> 00:58:32,772
lt would change things for sure,
turn everything upside down... !

499
00:58:36,815 --> 00:58:39,613
Why didn't you finish it?

500
00:58:42,535 --> 00:58:45,129
When for years
you wake up that...

501
00:58:45,215 --> 00:58:48,446
you have to win
every battle every day...

502
00:58:48,535 --> 00:58:51,891
to prove that you are
the best at everything...

503
00:58:52,535 --> 00:58:55,971
l started to worry what
would happen if it turned out

504
00:58:56,055 --> 00:58:58,410
l wasn't the best.

505
00:58:58,815 --> 00:59:01,249
l didn't want to be worry...

506
00:59:06,015 --> 00:59:08,370
lt's a pity you didn't finish it.

507
00:59:13,015 --> 00:59:16,610
You know where to find me.
Think about it.

508
00:59:16,695 --> 00:59:19,255
- l like your tie.
- Thanks.

509
00:59:21,415 --> 00:59:24,213
- Think about it.
- lt was good to see you.

510
00:59:24,295 --> 00:59:26,445
Good to see you, too.

511
01:00:03,775 --> 01:00:07,370
You don't have to bring me lunch
every day.

512
01:00:07,655 --> 01:00:10,374
l like it.

513
01:00:11,695 --> 01:00:14,607
l like coming down here.

514
01:00:30,335 --> 01:00:32,769
- Dad?
- Yes?

515
01:00:34,935 --> 01:00:37,130
Do you think l'm weird?

516
01:00:39,855 --> 01:00:42,244
Fortunately, yes.

517
01:00:43,655 --> 01:00:46,328
No... l'm serious.

518
01:00:47,375 --> 01:00:50,208
Take your time.

519
01:01:03,335 --> 01:01:06,407
l hated this job anyway...

520
01:01:07,175 --> 01:01:10,804
You'll find a better one.
A much better one.

521
01:01:18,975 --> 01:01:21,569
You look like an angel.

522
01:01:24,135 --> 01:01:28,287
You should of seen me in my prime.

523
01:02:50,215 --> 01:02:52,570
Excuse me.

524
01:02:53,815 --> 01:02:57,649
Laci, help... Laci... l'll bring help...

525
01:03:08,935 --> 01:03:12,052
Say something to him.

526
01:03:28,575 --> 01:03:33,205
l stepped him off the train
and he socked me.

527
01:03:33,295 --> 01:03:38,085
- l see. Don't let him get you
into trouble. - l didn't start it.

528
01:03:38,175 --> 01:03:41,645
l believe you. l didn't say you did.
Just don't fuck up.

529
01:03:41,735 --> 01:03:46,968
l asked for his ticket and he hit me.
He hit me for no reason.

530
01:03:51,215 --> 01:03:53,092
He socked me in the nose.

531
01:03:53,175 --> 01:03:56,690
Listen, l know, just...
leave him alone.

532
01:04:00,695 --> 01:04:03,050
l'm sick of it all.

533
01:06:16,655 --> 01:06:19,533
Having dinner, Uncle Béla?

534
01:06:19,615 --> 01:06:23,654
Bulcsú... ! Hi!
What are you doing here?

535
01:06:23,735 --> 01:06:26,090
- What are you doing here?
- Me?

536
01:06:26,175 --> 01:06:30,407
l'm a night owl.
Come, have a bite. A Béla plate...

537
01:06:31,415 --> 01:06:33,645
Thank you...

538
01:06:39,695 --> 01:06:41,333
Thanks...

539
01:06:41,415 --> 01:06:44,771
Cucumber, tomato, apple, onion...

540
01:06:46,615 --> 01:06:48,412
Onion.

541
01:06:49,655 --> 01:06:51,373
Thank you.

542
01:07:06,735 --> 01:07:10,887
A guy goes into a bar and orders
ten shots of brandy.

543
01:07:11,215 --> 01:07:13,604
The barman asks him.
'Ten, sir?'

544
01:07:13,695 --> 01:07:16,414
'Give them to me,' the guy says.

545
01:07:16,495 --> 01:07:19,487
- Do you know it?
- No.

546
01:07:20,135 --> 01:07:23,013
The barman pours the ten shots
of vodka

547
01:07:23,095 --> 01:07:25,893
and lines them up on the counter.

548
01:07:26,735 --> 01:07:30,444
The guy takes the first
and the tenth one,

549
01:07:30,535 --> 01:07:33,766
picks them up and pours them
out on the floor.

550
01:07:33,855 --> 01:07:37,404
He drinks the remaining eight,
one after the other.

551
01:07:37,495 --> 01:07:40,771
The barman asks with surprise:

552
01:07:40,855 --> 01:07:44,086
'Why did you pour those two
shots out on the floor?'

553
01:07:44,655 --> 01:07:49,046
'Look, sonny, the first one
always tastes horrible

554
01:07:50,015 --> 01:07:53,530
and the last
one always makes me sick.'

555
01:08:01,335 --> 01:08:03,371
Does it hurt that bad?

556
01:08:04,735 --> 01:08:07,010
Horribly.

557
01:08:07,775 --> 01:08:10,892
l've never heard
such a bad joke before... !

558
01:08:13,495 --> 01:08:15,929
Béla joke.

559
01:08:20,255 --> 01:08:23,930
- Want to hear another one?
- No. No, thanks.

560
01:08:31,815 --> 01:08:34,693
Go on eat.

561
01:08:44,855 --> 01:08:46,766
Eat...

562
01:08:55,535 --> 01:08:57,844
Thank you very much.

563
01:09:01,335 --> 01:09:03,053
Don't go.

564
01:09:15,495 --> 01:09:18,487
How can you get out of here,
uncle Béla?

565
01:09:20,215 --> 01:09:23,173
There are many ways out, Bulcsú!

566
01:10:43,215 --> 01:10:45,649
lván Kapitány!

567
01:10:45,735 --> 01:10:47,453
Here.

568
01:10:49,655 --> 01:10:53,807
- l've never been to a psychiatrist.
- There's really nothing to it.

569
01:10:54,695 --> 01:10:57,528
l don't like the idea of someone
messing around inside my head.

570
01:10:57,615 --> 01:10:59,924
You needn't worry.

571
01:11:00,015 --> 01:11:03,007
Can't make waves
if you don't have any water.

572
01:11:03,095 --> 01:11:05,928
- What?
- Nothing.

573
01:11:16,735 --> 01:11:20,011
The disease is called narcolepsy.

574
01:11:21,575 --> 01:11:23,850
So when a conflict comes,

575
01:11:23,935 --> 01:11:27,245
...when l wake up
l just don't know what happened.

576
01:11:27,775 --> 01:11:33,532
l have this recurring dream
that in the other world

577
01:11:33,615 --> 01:11:38,006
all the people l ever fined
are torturing me

578
01:11:38,095 --> 01:11:40,973
with red hot iron and pincers.

579
01:11:41,215 --> 01:11:44,048
l don't do any more
what the others do...

580
01:11:44,135 --> 01:11:46,933
a bottle hidden
in the water tank in the lavatory.

581
01:11:47,015 --> 01:11:51,054
l take it with me, portioned out
nicely, this is just one little mouthful.

582
01:11:51,135 --> 01:11:53,046
They sneer at you...

583
01:11:53,175 --> 01:11:57,646
l enrolled in a yoga course,
meditations and suchlike...

584
01:11:57,735 --> 01:12:00,010
l've lost my femininity...
everything...

585
01:12:00,095 --> 01:12:03,531
Shouldn't you prescribe glasses
against these neon lights?

586
01:12:03,615 --> 01:12:08,973
When l'm in the manic phase
l simply charge at them.

587
01:12:09,335 --> 01:12:11,087
What's this?

588
01:12:11,175 --> 01:12:13,848
l checked if he had a ticket...

589
01:12:13,935 --> 01:12:17,007
He was so charming,
so good looking.

590
01:12:17,095 --> 01:12:20,724
And he smiled back at me so cutely,
l was really surprised...

591
01:12:20,815 --> 01:12:23,170
that he smiles at a ticket inspector.

592
01:12:23,255 --> 01:12:26,725
Probably that's not what he saw
in me, the inspector, but the woman.

593
01:12:27,215 --> 01:12:28,284
l need something.

594
01:12:28,375 --> 01:12:30,491
l don't know what all these idiots
expect me to do...

595
01:12:30,575 --> 01:12:31,974
l haven't had a fuck
for two months...

596
01:12:32,055 --> 01:12:33,932
What do you mean
trespassers will be prosecuted?

597
01:12:34,015 --> 01:12:35,653
Why did you leave
your pass at home?

598
01:12:35,735 --> 01:12:38,454
Elbow hits, knee hits,
then on the head and that's it.

599
01:12:39,975 --> 01:12:43,445
My brother and l are always
competing at everything.

600
01:12:43,535 --> 01:12:46,971
On the football field,
everywhere.

601
01:12:47,095 --> 01:12:50,212
We are in a band,
both of us, but...

602
01:12:50,295 --> 01:12:54,288
He is on the drums, l do the keyboard
but still we are competing.

603
01:12:54,375 --> 01:12:59,369
l don't get it. Miklós is always
giving me shit,

604
01:12:59,495 --> 01:13:05,730
in the band he plays all instruments,

605
01:13:05,975 --> 01:13:08,011
he is driving me crazy.

606
01:13:09,775 --> 01:13:11,174
l'm scared.

607
01:13:11,415 --> 01:13:12,814
l'd like to screw someone.

608
01:13:16,975 --> 01:13:18,408
l wanted to breed dogs...

609
01:13:18,495 --> 01:13:20,611
l was admitted finally...

610
01:13:43,695 --> 01:13:47,927
Excuse me...
Doc... hey, wait...

611
01:13:49,295 --> 01:13:52,492
How much?
l'll buy it, okay?

612
01:14:08,695 --> 01:14:10,765
Okay, okay, okay, okay...

613
01:14:11,295 --> 01:14:13,684
Relax!

614
01:14:18,775 --> 01:14:20,891
- What happened?
- Self defense.

615
01:14:22,135 --> 01:14:24,569
- We don't beat up passengers.
- She kicked me in the nuts.

616
01:14:24,655 --> 01:14:28,443
- Only after you grabbed me.
- You're a psycho bitch.

617
01:14:29,015 --> 01:14:31,575
l'll take care of this...

618
01:14:31,655 --> 01:14:34,044
l'm reporting this, Bulcsú.

619
01:14:34,535 --> 01:14:38,084
What are you going to report?
That a teddy bear attacked you?

620
01:14:38,175 --> 01:14:40,814
Teddy bear?
She is an aggressive animal.

621
01:14:40,895 --> 01:14:42,613
Behind me.

622
01:14:42,775 --> 01:14:44,174
Come!

623
01:14:45,695 --> 01:14:47,413
Margit!

624
01:14:48,615 --> 01:14:50,651
Where were you?

625
01:15:09,895 --> 01:15:13,649
You! You want to go up
and get a coffee?

626
01:15:23,015 --> 01:15:25,404
You're working. l understand.

627
01:15:29,335 --> 01:15:32,930
- l know a nice place close by.
- What?

628
01:15:33,175 --> 01:15:37,612
- A nice place down here.
- Now l can hear you.

629
01:15:43,775 --> 01:15:46,243
l'll buy you coffee.

630
01:15:47,055 --> 01:15:48,852
Okay.

631
01:16:10,455 --> 01:16:12,252
Sugar?

632
01:16:14,815 --> 01:16:18,410
Nice place.
Come here often?

633
01:16:19,335 --> 01:16:22,691
Only when l really want
to impress a girl.

634
01:16:28,455 --> 01:16:30,411
Thanks.

635
01:16:36,455 --> 01:16:39,288
You like working down here?

636
01:16:41,175 --> 01:16:43,769
You kind of get used to it.

637
01:16:48,535 --> 01:16:51,493
l never thought about it.

638
01:16:52,255 --> 01:16:54,325
What?

639
01:16:55,575 --> 01:16:59,090
lt must be tough for you guys.

640
01:17:01,255 --> 01:17:04,088
Everyone hates us.

641
01:17:05,175 --> 01:17:07,814
Now that's a little paranoid,
you know...

642
01:17:07,895 --> 01:17:11,444
No that's the way it is.
Everyone hates us.

643
01:17:17,535 --> 01:17:20,811
Why don't you ever buy a ticket?

644
01:17:22,935 --> 01:17:25,608
Why l never buy a ticket?

645
01:17:26,495 --> 01:17:28,531
Because l don't have to.

646
01:17:28,615 --> 01:17:31,971
My father's a metro driver.

647
01:17:38,015 --> 01:17:40,449
Who's your father?

648
01:17:40,895 --> 01:17:44,524
l'm sure you know him. Béla.

649
01:17:48,775 --> 01:17:51,005
You're Béla's daughter?

650
01:17:53,375 --> 01:17:55,764
Yeah. Why?

651
01:17:57,335 --> 01:18:00,213
l really like Béla.

652
01:18:03,775 --> 01:18:06,209
Can l ask you something?

653
01:18:08,615 --> 01:18:12,369
ls it true he used to drive
trains up top?

654
01:18:14,975 --> 01:18:16,693
Yeah.

655
01:18:17,415 --> 01:18:20,134
ls it true he crashed a locomotive
in Keleti station?

656
01:18:20,215 --> 01:18:22,729
Yeah. No one was hurt though.

657
01:18:30,935 --> 01:18:34,769
- lnadequate braking distance.
- lt happens.

658
01:18:35,055 --> 01:18:36,773
lt does.

659
01:18:36,935 --> 01:18:41,292
So there's a costume ball
tomorrow night. l saw some posters.

660
01:18:43,935 --> 01:18:46,449
- Are you coming?
- No.

661
01:18:46,535 --> 01:18:50,210
l mean l'll be down here
but l won't be dressing up.

662
01:18:50,295 --> 01:18:52,570
Why? That's the whole point.

663
01:18:52,775 --> 01:18:55,528
l'm funny enough without a costume.

664
01:19:01,535 --> 01:19:04,095
Who are you hiding from?

665
01:19:15,175 --> 01:19:17,928
You wanna meet tomorrow?

666
01:19:22,015 --> 01:19:23,812
Yeah.

667
01:19:24,935 --> 01:19:27,210
You gonna take me to the ball?

668
01:19:35,775 --> 01:19:37,766
Hello.

669
01:19:39,535 --> 01:19:41,730
Good evening.

670
01:24:21,055 --> 01:24:25,287
Suits from the main office
have come looking for you.

671
01:24:39,015 --> 01:24:41,085
Sit down.

672
01:24:41,175 --> 01:24:44,485
Do you have any requests
before we start?

673
01:24:46,375 --> 01:24:49,014
May l have a glass of water?

674
01:24:54,775 --> 01:24:58,051
What happened this afternoon?

675
01:24:59,895 --> 01:25:02,887
Look at the tapes.

676
01:25:03,535 --> 01:25:05,844
We did.

677
01:25:13,215 --> 01:25:16,571
This isn't just about
your job any more.

678
01:25:16,655 --> 01:25:19,123
You realize that, don't you?

679
01:25:25,095 --> 01:25:29,532
lf you refuse to answer
our questions

680
01:25:30,255 --> 01:25:34,885
we will be forced
to work out our own version.

681
01:25:36,535 --> 01:25:39,766
And what is your version?

682
01:25:42,215 --> 01:25:44,775
Switch it on.

683
01:25:49,855 --> 01:25:53,245
This moment you're still
running after the kid.

684
01:25:53,335 --> 01:25:55,803
But the next moment...
look...

685
01:25:57,655 --> 01:26:01,284
the kid is already lying
on the tracks.

686
01:26:02,975 --> 01:26:06,365
That's bullshit. Half of it
was omitted, you know that.

687
01:26:07,535 --> 01:26:09,924
Switch it off.

688
01:26:14,415 --> 01:26:20,490
There are 300 million people
traveling on this metro a year...

689
01:26:22,335 --> 01:26:25,645
You fucking bastard.

690
01:26:26,495 --> 01:26:29,805
Do you think l'll let you
cross my path?

691
01:26:31,295 --> 01:26:35,368
- l didn't push them. - So you admit
that you know they were pushed?

692
01:26:35,455 --> 01:26:39,004
- Who pushed them?
- l don't know.

693
01:26:39,095 --> 01:26:42,167
But l do. You did.

694
01:27:03,495 --> 01:27:07,204
Why have you been sleeping
on the platforms?

695
01:27:07,495 --> 01:27:09,486
None of your business.

696
01:27:10,015 --> 01:27:12,973
So you refuse to answer
my question

697
01:27:13,055 --> 01:27:16,889
why you have been sleeping
on the platforms.

698
01:27:17,255 --> 01:27:21,407
You spend 24 hours
a day down here,

699
01:27:22,935 --> 01:27:26,848
which would give you excellent
opportunities to learn

700
01:27:26,935 --> 01:27:32,055
when the cameras are on
and where they are placed.

701
01:27:33,655 --> 01:27:37,967
You're out of your mind.
lf you think l killed those people

702
01:27:38,055 --> 01:27:40,694
then where are the police?

703
01:27:40,775 --> 01:27:44,290
- Why haven't l been arrested?
- All in good time.

704
01:27:44,375 --> 01:27:48,414
Bullshit. You've got nothing.
l won't be your scapegoat.

705
01:27:49,895 --> 01:27:51,931
You don't have permission to leave.

706
01:27:52,015 --> 01:27:55,325
l don't need it.
l don't work for you any more.

707
01:27:55,895 --> 01:27:58,125
Stop!

708
01:27:59,575 --> 01:28:01,770
Stop!

709
01:28:10,895 --> 01:28:13,170
What's going on, Bulcsú?
What did they ask you?

710
01:28:13,255 --> 01:28:15,007
Nothing.

711
01:28:15,135 --> 01:28:18,810
- We're your crew. We deserve
an explanation. - Not any more.

712
01:28:18,895 --> 01:28:21,329
lf those bastards made you quit,
we can fight it.

713
01:28:21,415 --> 01:28:25,249
No need. They didn't fire me.
l quit. l've had enough.

714
01:28:25,335 --> 01:28:29,089
- What are you going to do now?
- Wander around the system?

715
01:28:29,175 --> 01:28:32,212
Maybe push somebody
onto the tracks?

716
01:28:32,295 --> 01:28:36,004
- What are you talking about?
- That's what this is all about!

717
01:28:36,095 --> 01:28:39,451
The suits think all the jumpers
have been pushed

718
01:28:39,535 --> 01:28:42,527
- and Bulcsú has pushed them.
- That's fucking crazy.

719
01:28:42,615 --> 01:28:43,730
- ls it?
- lt is.

720
01:28:43,815 --> 01:28:47,410
Who thought Laci
could slit a man's throat?

721
01:28:48,975 --> 01:28:52,012
Over the last few weeks
you've missed the bufe.

722
01:28:52,095 --> 01:28:54,928
'l overslept'. l called you
last night, 'l was out.'.

723
01:28:55,015 --> 01:28:58,530
You've been lying to us, because
you're wandering day and night

724
01:28:58,615 --> 01:29:01,334
around the system, like some
crazy homeless person.

725
01:29:01,415 --> 01:29:03,929
What else have you been lying about?

726
01:29:04,095 --> 01:29:06,609
l don't even know
who you are any more.

727
01:29:06,695 --> 01:29:10,768
- What do you want from me?
- Answer the question. ls it true?

728
01:29:12,135 --> 01:29:14,365
Did you push them?

729
01:30:27,815 --> 01:30:29,407
Bulcsú!

730
01:30:34,175 --> 01:30:37,247
l'm happy to see you, man.

731
01:30:49,615 --> 01:30:52,607
Gonzó! Gonzó!

732
01:30:53,535 --> 01:30:55,890
You fucking idiot.

733
01:30:57,495 --> 01:31:00,965
What have you done?
You, you beast!

734
01:31:06,455 --> 01:31:08,650
Bulcsú.

735
01:31:28,055 --> 01:31:31,013
We'll sit down on the bench.

736
01:36:24,895 --> 01:36:28,012
Get the fuck out of here.

737
01:41:10,215 --> 01:41:12,251
Look!

738
01:42:12,895 --> 01:42:15,932
