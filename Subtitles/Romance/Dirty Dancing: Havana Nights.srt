00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:42,992
(girl) November 1958,
my senior year of high school.

3
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:47,116
While other girls were dancing to Elvis
and dreaming about prom dates,

4
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:50,272
I was reading Jane Austen
and dreaming about college.

5
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:54,956
And then my parents announced
we were moving to Cuba... in a week.

Slamming doors and giving the

00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:11,037
but it was easier
than admitting I was really scared.

13
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:12,792
At least everyone else was happy.

14
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:14,871
Dad got his big promotion from Ford,

15
00:01:14,959 --> 00:01:16,677
Mom got to travel in style,

16
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:20,912

Here's what I know about Cuba.

36
00:02:51,719 --> 00:02:53,869
My high-school French
wasn't going to help me.

37
00:02:53,959 --> 00:02:57,109
I didn't know a single person.
and though no one would talk about it...

Fidel Castro was leading the people in a
revolution against President Batista.

00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:04,920
Not that you would know it
from this place.

♪ Sitting here
and wondering what it's all about...

41
00:03:07,719 --> 00:03:10,677
This is Cuba.
Nobody cares what you do here.

00:03:11,319 --> 00:03:15,198
- Susie, you want a smoke?
- Watch out. She's a bad influence.

43
00:03:15,279 --> 00:03:18,908
- I'll take that as a compliment.
- She'll have you ditching classes.

44
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,516
As I recall, there's a certain someone
that likes to ditch them with me.

What, majoring in fashion?

51
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:47,995

Yeah.

And I guess you know Susie, right?

58
00:04:10,919 --> 00:04:13,558
- Are you really going to Radcliffe?
- I won't know until spring.

Oh. Watch out, girls.

chilly?

62
00:04:25,159 --> 00:04:26,433
Oh.

63
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:30,475
- Shit.
- Oh, l'm so sorry. lt's my fault.

64
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:33,677
- Let me...
- No, just go get new drinks.

65
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:41,070
Stupid spic.

66
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:45,871
Excuse me.

67
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,511
You know, you'll have to pay for those.

68
00:04:51,599 --> 00:04:54,432
- Hey, it wasn't my fault.
- Next time, be more careful.

69
00:04:54,519 --> 00:04:57,158
- Excuse me, señior?
- How may I help you, señiorita?

70
00:04:57,239 --> 00:04:59,230
I knocked into those drinks.
I'd like to pay for them.

71
00:04:59,319 --> 00:05:03,790
That will not be necessary.
Accidents happen. Excuse me.

72
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:09,472
- Yo tengo...
- I speak English.

73
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,471
And I don't need your charity.

74
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:16,750
- It's not.
- Don't worry about it. It's OK.

75
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,673
- I'm sorry for what she called you.
- That was nothing.

76
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:25,115
- Not to me.
- Then why are you apologizing?

77
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:35,597
- You guys were so good.
- Your mother was good.

78
00:05:35,679 --> 00:05:38,034
I was... OK.

79
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:41,076
- Dad?
- Hm?

80
00:05:42,039 --> 00:05:46,237
I'm sorry
I haven't been excited about all of this.

81
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:54,399
Sweetheart, it's OK. Senior year is a
terrible time to drag you out of school.

82
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:56,629
- Especially when you're star of the class.
- Dad.

83
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:59,951
Come on, don't deny it.
Be proud of it.

84
00:06:01,119 --> 00:06:03,189
You'll do great here too.

85
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:06,192
(Latin music)

86
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:19,274
I can't stand on your feet anymore.

87
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:28,516
- Hey, you remembered that.
- Yeah.

88
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:30,511
Very good!

89
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:38,070
Let's continue where we left off.
Book 18, page 285.

90
00:06:38,159 --> 00:06:40,434
Katey, just do your best
to follow along.

91
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:43,353
- It's OK, I read it last year.
- (all groan)

92
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:44,839
Knock it off.

93
00:06:44,919 --> 00:06:48,434
Well, then, perhaps you'd like
to begin reading at line 342.

94
00:06:50,039 --> 00:06:53,315
"Now the suitors turned
to dance and song,

95
00:06:53,399 --> 00:06:55,390
to the lovely beat and sway,

96
00:06:56,399 --> 00:06:58,788
waiting for dusk
to come upon them there."

97
00:06:59,319 --> 00:07:03,471
"And the dark night came upon them,
lost in pleasure."

98
00:07:05,159 --> 00:07:07,070
(muttering)

99
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:11,199
Can anyone tell us
the significance of this passage?

100
00:07:11,279 --> 00:07:13,588
It's a bunch of drunk guys doing it.

101
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:23,195
Athena wants the suitors
to keep invading Odysseus' house

102
00:07:23,279 --> 00:07:25,429
so that he'll get angry enough to kill
them.

103
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:28,398
And why does the goddess want that?

104
00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:35,312
She wants Odysseus
to find his strength... and courage?

105
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:37,670
Very good.

106
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:41,391
(bell)

107
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:54,671
Need a ride home?

108
00:07:56,559 --> 00:08:00,632
No, I'm OK. I got a lot of
catching up to do.

109
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:03,076
A lot of girls don't let on
when they're smart.

110
00:08:03,159 --> 00:08:06,037
- I know, I shouIdn't have said that.
- No, I like that.

111
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:10,034
I like that about you.

112
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:16,629
A bunch of us are going to our
country club on Saturday night.

113
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:20,110
There'll be a band.
The music's pretty cool.

114
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:24,439
Would you like to go with me?

115
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:27,990
-I really do have a lot of work to do.
- On a Saturday night?

116
00:08:29,559 --> 00:08:31,515
Wow!

117
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:38,278
Come on. I'm sure even Homer took some
time off between the Iliad and the Odyssey.

118
00:08:38,359 --> 00:08:40,509
Well, sure. OK.

119
00:08:41,199 --> 00:08:43,872
OK.

120
00:08:49,039 --> 00:08:51,792
(Eve) We're all here now. You can go.

121
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:12,237
(indistinct conversation in Spanish)

122
00:09:13,559 --> 00:09:15,675
(man wolf whistles)

123
00:09:38,439 --> 00:09:40,828
(Latin music)

124
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:40,431
You felt a sudden urge for Cuban
music?

125
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:44,069
The van left without me.
I've been walking for an hour.

126
00:10:44,159 --> 00:10:46,992
- I can walk you back.
- Oh, no, you don't have to do that.

127
00:10:47,359 --> 00:10:50,510
Yeah, you're right.
You'll find your way sooner or later.

128
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:55,151
Maybe in a week or a month.
Let me just say goodbye.

129
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:57,151
¡Abuelito!

130
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:12,038
- What was it you called him?
- Abuelito. It's my grandpa.

131
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:16,399
- I'm Katey. What's your name?
- Javier.

132
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:21,197
So, what,
you know, like, five words in Spanish?

133
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:23,235
Maybe ten.

134
00:11:23,319 --> 00:11:27,471
- What are you studying so hard to do?
- I haven't figured it out yet.

135
00:11:27,559 --> 00:11:29,629
Here. Let me take that.

136
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:37,239
I've never seen dancing like that.

137
00:11:38,199 --> 00:11:41,077
- Like what?
- I don't know.

138
00:11:42,199 --> 00:11:44,110
I like it. It's very...

139
00:11:48,599 --> 00:11:50,510
- Very Cuban?
- Yeah.

140
00:11:51,639 --> 00:11:54,199
(men singing in Spanish)

141
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,589
(horse whinnies)

142
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:19,716
- We should get off the street.
- Why?

143
00:12:19,799 --> 00:12:23,314
You don't understand what they're
singing.

144
00:12:27,879 --> 00:12:29,073
No!

145
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:32,992
That way!

146
00:12:34,719 --> 00:12:39,554
So you've got... OK.
Oh, here she is. Thank you so much.

147
00:12:39,639 --> 00:12:43,154
Thank God. Katey,
where have you been?

148
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:46,471
I missed the bus. I'm fine. I walked.

149
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:49,632
For heaven's sakes.
Katey, why didn't you call me?

150
00:12:49,719 --> 00:12:53,155
For all I knew you could have been
kidnapped by rebels.

151
00:12:53,239 --> 00:12:58,029
- It's not the rebels you should worry about.
- What did you say?

152
00:13:00,479 --> 00:13:03,755
You're right. I'm sorry.
I should have called.

153
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:06,194
Honey, where's your book bag?

154
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:11,797
I left it at school. It was heavy.

155
00:13:16,839 --> 00:13:17,954
(Latin music)

156
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:01,950
Oh, God.

157
00:14:02,039 --> 00:14:05,111
It was good I had all these
boring American books with me.

158
00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:07,713
They realized I couldn't be
a revolutionary.

159
00:14:07,799 --> 00:14:11,314
I don't understand.
They were just singing.

160
00:14:11,399 --> 00:14:14,197
There's not such a thing
as just singing here anymore.

161
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:19,829
You know, you're a pretty good dancer.

162
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:26,468
- I was terrible.
- Ah, yeah. Yeah, you were terrible.

163
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:28,835
But for an American, you move well.

164
00:14:28,919 --> 00:14:30,511
Oh, thanks.

165
00:14:35,119 --> 00:14:37,314
Why do you look in the mirror?

166
00:14:37,399 --> 00:14:39,867
I was trying to remember the steps I
saw.

167
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:42,918
But what does looking have to do with
it?

168
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,912
Just... just feel the music.

169
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,116

00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,958
Katey, you left your sweater in my car.

345
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:06,508
- Just bring it to school.
- Wait a second.

346
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:08,431
Katey...

347
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:14,197
I'm really sorry. I was drinking.
I would never hurt you.

348
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:18,310
He's not here.

349
00:29:19,839 --> 00:29:22,399
- They fired him.
- What?

350
00:29:22,999 --> 00:29:26,071
Lois and your sister, they saw you.

351
00:29:28,959 --> 00:29:31,951
- I'm sorry.
- I gotta go.

352
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:38,231
(door closes)

353
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:46,429
You need to keep your mouth shut.
The things you do have consequences.

354
00:29:46,519 --> 00:29:49,670
- Lois is the one who blabbed it.
- Oh, right.

355
00:29:49,759 --> 00:29:51,875
And you had nothing to do with it?

356
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:55,430
What were you doing
with that guy anyway? It's embarrassing.

357
00:29:55,519 --> 00:29:57,874
Is that you talking
or is it those other girls?

358
00:29:57,960 --> 00:29:59,791
He's not like us.

359
00:29:59,879 --> 00:30:02,757
There is no "us," Susie.

360
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:17,756
- Hola.
- Hola.

361
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:22,755
I'm looking for Javier Suarez.

362
00:30:22,839 --> 00:30:24,750
- Si.
- Chabe!

363
00:30:25,879 --> 00:30:28,234
- Yes?
- I'm a friend of Javier's.

364
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:31,312
- ¿ Cómo?
- From the hotel.

365
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:36,118
I didn't know he had friends in the
hotel.

366
00:30:37,399 --> 00:30:38,912
Um... is he here?

367
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:43,356
No. He's working there now.
You... don't see him?

368
00:30:50,398 --> 00:30:52,398
- She's looking for Javier.
- I know her.

369
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:55,400
- Come inside, Chabe.
- Go with your grandmother.

370
00:30:56,439 --> 00:30:59,954
So... what do you want with my
brother?

371
00:31:00,039 --> 00:31:02,599
I need to talk to him.

372
00:31:02,679 --> 00:31:04,749
You got him fired. Isn't that enough?

373
00:31:07,959 --> 00:31:09,870
I know a way he can make some
money.

374
00:31:11,159 --> 00:31:14,390
You yanquis, you come here
and you pour money into the casinos,

375
00:31:14,479 --> 00:31:17,039
into the pockets of the gangsters
who run this country.

376
00:31:17,119 --> 00:31:21,317
The same gangsters who murder
innocent people like my father.

377
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:26,030
- I didn't know.
- That's right. You don't know.

378
00:31:26,119 --> 00:31:28,838
(Latin music)

379
00:31:35,039 --> 00:31:36,677
Javi.

380
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:41,233
What is she doing here?

381
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:45,198
I feel terrible about what happened.
I went to your house...

382
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:48,636
- You told my mother I was fired?
- No, I didn't.

383
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:51,393
- So what do you want?
- I told her I wanted to talk to you.

384
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:53,914
I'm sorry you got fired.

385
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:57,639
Don'tworry. It's my fault. I knew better.

386
00:31:58,839 --> 00:32:01,114
- Is this your newjob?
- That's right.

387
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:05,079
You make 'em, we steal 'em.
Isn't that right, Javi?

388
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:16,919
There's this... this dance contest
at the Palace, Christmas Eve.

389
00:32:17,559 --> 00:32:20,596
- I think you should go.
- And see if they need any busboys?

390
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:23,034
That's not what I mean.

391
00:32:23,119 --> 00:32:26,316
You know what kind of people
goes to the Palace?

392
00:32:26,399 --> 00:32:29,948
I could get you in.
You'd have to be my partner.

393
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:36,670
You mean dance with you?

394
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:38,671
God, I'm not that bad.

395
00:32:41,279 --> 00:32:44,396
- You didn't mind it last night.
- I wasn't trying to win a contest.

396
00:32:44,479 --> 00:32:46,390
Oh, weren't you?

397
00:32:50,159 --> 00:32:53,151
I'm sorry, but I have a lot of work to do.

398
00:32:53,239 --> 00:32:56,311
The prize for the semifinals is $300.

399
00:32:57,720 --> 00:32:59,631
The grand prize is $5,000.

400
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:03,033
The winners get to go to America.

401
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:06,599
I don't have time.

402
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:09,830
OK.

403
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,956
Here. Goto Papa.

404
00:33:24,039 --> 00:33:25,597
We could use some help here!

405
00:33:25,679 --> 00:33:27,715
I have to make a delivery.

406
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:31,156
Oh, a delivery! You hear that, Rafael?

407
00:33:32,439 --> 00:33:35,829
Yes, medical supplies. You wanna
see?

408
00:33:38,439 --> 00:33:41,431
Glad you have such a big heart,
Carlos.

409
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:44,079
Maybe someday you'll help your family.

410
00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:46,753
Someday you'll realize I am.

411
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:11,711
Hi.

412
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:20,350
This contest... does it cost money?

413
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:24,236
No.

414
00:34:24,319 --> 00:34:27,356
You know that it's ballroom dancing.
It's not what I do.

415
00:34:27,439 --> 00:34:28,838
It's Latin ballroom.

416
00:34:28,919 --> 00:34:33,071
If we mix what you do with what I do,
I really think we'd have something.

417
00:34:33,159 --> 00:34:36,993
- I still have to teach you everything.
- Not everything.

418
00:34:37,599 --> 00:34:39,829
I'll have to teach you a few things too.

419
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:41,831
Hm.

420
00:34:44,759 --> 00:34:47,068
Can we do this?

421
00:34:48,319 --> 00:34:50,435
(Latin music)

422
00:34:54,599 --> 00:34:55,554
What?

423
00:34:55,639 --> 00:34:57,869
- What are you doing?
- Just dancing.

424
00:34:58,719 --> 00:35:02,792
But this is a routine.
You can'tjust do what you feel like...

425
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:06,111
- When I dance I have no routine.
- But this is a contest.

426
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:09,078
- We need a structure.
- Can I see that?

427
00:35:11,159 --> 00:35:12,433
Huh!

428
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:19,274
First you learn to move and then
we'll worry about lists and words.

429
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:23,148
- How do you call this?
- Your hips.

430
00:35:24,399 --> 00:35:27,471
Move your hips. A circle.

431
00:35:28,799 --> 00:35:31,677
Come on. Come on, a circle.

432
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:33,755
That's a box.

433
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:37,313
What, are you crazy?
Why should I cover for you?

434
00:35:37,399 --> 00:35:39,469
You want me to tell them what
happened?

435
00:35:40,359 --> 00:35:43,032
- Well, hello there.
- Mom.

436
00:35:43,119 --> 00:35:45,314
We're heading over for lemonade.
Care to join us?

437
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:47,436
No. No.

438
00:35:47,519 --> 00:35:50,431
- We'll take a rain check.
- OK. You two have fun.

439
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:53,391

and you're gonna help me.

It's not gonna be a crowded club.

446
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:17,438
We've gotta sweep
across the dance floor.

447
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:19,636
OK, I can sweep.

448
00:36:21,199 --> 00:36:23,190

Your steps are too big.

God, I must have been crazy

487
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:35,600
It's in two weeks
and whenever he pushes, I pull,

488
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:38,990
and I'm flowing and I'm being free

489
00:39:39,079 --> 00:39:42,594
and I'm making a circle
and I'm not an ironing board anymore

490
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:44,591
and it's still not working.

491
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:48,110
And now he says "You're afraid."

492
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:51,959
- Are you?
- No.

493
00:39:54,079 --> 00:39:56,593
That's too bad.

00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:02,677
Come here. Un momento.
Stand right here.

00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:06,556
Let me see your frame.

496
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:09,271
Good.

497
00:40:11,959 --> 00:40:13,870
A little pressure.

498
00:40:16,679 --> 00:40:19,113
Mm-hm.

499
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:21,270
So where did you learn this?

500
00:40:21,359 --> 00:40:24,749
- My parents. They were dancers.
- Really?

501
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:28,833
Relax.

502
00:40:29,199 --> 00:40:32,191
Yes. Drop your arms.

503
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:33,918
Breathe.

504
00:40:36,279 --> 00:40:38,713
Now just basic.

505
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:42,675
Good.

506
00:40:43,919 --> 00:40:47,707
What did you mean
when you said "That's too bad"?

507
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:50,758
If you can't move through your fear
and connect with yourself,

508
00:40:50,839 --> 00:40:53,956
there's absolutely no way you're
gonna connect with your partner.

509
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,558
Listen to me.

510
00:40:56,640 --> 00:41:00,952
I know that it's scary as hell to let
another person touch that part of you.

511
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:04,555
But if you do, it's worth it.

512
00:41:06,159 --> 00:41:09,549
Now forget everything I just said
and dance.

513
00:41:09,640 --> 00:41:12,518
(Latin music)

514
00:42:14,680 --> 00:42:17,240
The floor's yours.

515
00:42:17,879 --> 00:42:20,154
I'll see you.

516
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:32,915
OK, I am.

517
00:42:34,359 --> 00:42:36,270
You're what?

518
00:42:37,559 --> 00:42:39,470
Afraid.

519
00:42:40,439 --> 00:42:41,189
(Javier) So the movement has to
be fluid, like the water.

520
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:48,039
Afro-Cuban dance, it's the dance of
slaves.

521
00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:51,718
When they danced,
it was their only time to feel free.

522
00:42:52,279 --> 00:42:56,431
So they could be a bird, you know,

523
00:42:57,120 --> 00:43:01,398
or do a flamenco step
and make fun of their owners.

524
00:43:01,479 --> 00:43:05,154
Or just be in the sea instead of being
stuck on an island away from home.

525
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:10,675
It's a dance about being exactly
who you wanna be in that moment.

526
00:43:15,839 --> 00:43:22,358
It has to feel and look
as natural as the waves.

527
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:28,197
Coming... and going.

528
00:43:28,919 --> 00:43:31,069
Coming...

529
00:43:34,999 --> 00:43:38,116
We were having dinner
and there was a knock on the door.

530
00:43:38,199 --> 00:43:41,157
Suddenly two policemen
were taking my father away.

531
00:43:41,239 --> 00:43:46,711
The traitor could have been anyone.
Batista has his spies everywhere.

532
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:49,792
That's the thing, you know.
My father never hurt anybody.

533
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:54,359
He was just a freethinker.
Someone didn't like his thoughts.

534
00:43:57,079 --> 00:44:00,116
We had a funeral
but we never found his body.

535
00:44:00,759 --> 00:44:03,831
Carlos disappeared for a while,
afraid he would be next.

536
00:44:03,919 --> 00:44:08,709
Then this girl shows up with a baby,
says it's his and she cannot afford it,

537
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:11,712
and suddenly
I'm in charge of my whole family.

538
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:15,349
Maybe it's not what you want for
yourself, but you are making a difference.

539
00:44:15,439 --> 00:44:18,590
There's a revolution out there
and what am I doing?

540
00:44:18,679 --> 00:44:20,988
Just painting stolen cars
and baby-sitting...

541
00:44:21,079 --> 00:44:26,358
No, you're keeping your family alive. That's
the most important thing you could do.

542
00:44:28,919 --> 00:44:32,116
If we could really win this contest,

543
00:44:33,359 --> 00:44:36,908
maybe I could bring my family
to America with us.

544
00:44:44,319 --> 00:44:46,674
Your parents, they're... they're perfect.

545
00:44:48,759 --> 00:44:52,593
You see how much
they wanna be in each other's arms?

546
00:44:53,480 --> 00:44:57,155
For us to dance together,
I mean really dance,

547
00:44:57,239 --> 00:44:59,799
that's how it has to be.

548
00:45:03,479 --> 00:45:07,313
(slow Latin music)

549
00:46:17,879 --> 00:46:20,188
(door closes)

550
00:46:21,359 --> 00:46:23,077
Don't let us interrupt you.

551
00:46:23,159 --> 00:46:25,354
- No, we were just...
- Yeah, we saw.

552
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:31,549
Listen, we have more stuff in the alley
if you want to do something useful, Javier.

553
00:46:31,639 --> 00:46:33,709
I should get home.

554
00:46:49,719 --> 00:46:51,630
Thanks for stopping by.

555
00:46:52,919 --> 00:46:55,387
It's half an hour before curfew.

556
00:46:55,480 --> 00:46:59,189
- What did you do, join the circus?
- Uh-huh.

557
00:47:00,079 --> 00:47:02,434
You gonna tell me
you were out with James?

558
00:47:02,959 --> 00:47:05,314
That's what you told your mother.

559
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:08,517
I never told her what Susie said.

560
00:47:08,600 --> 00:47:10,511
Susie was wrong.

561
00:47:12,760 --> 00:47:15,638
- OK.
- Good night, Dad.

562
00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:21,431
Hi.

563
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:27,348
How long you gonna be mad at me?

564
00:47:33,039 --> 00:47:35,758
The girls here...
I told Lois that I liked Jane Eyre

565
00:47:35,839 --> 00:47:39,468
and she asked me what movie she
was in.

566
00:47:41,640 --> 00:47:44,313
I'm really sorry that I told on you.

567
00:47:45,720 --> 00:47:48,871
And what I said about Javier, I was
wrong.

568
00:47:54,840 --> 00:47:58,913
- You gotta think for yourself, Suse.
- I know.

569
00:47:58,999 --> 00:48:00,910
I miss you.

570
00:48:07,640 --> 00:48:11,713

Where are you going?

618
00:50:35,520 --> 00:50:36,839
It's Christmas Eve.

619
00:50:36,920 --> 00:50:38,876
Mom said you were working tonight.

620
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:42,111
Come here. I need your suit.

621
00:50:42,199 --> 00:50:43,712
What for?

622
00:50:43,799 --> 00:50:45,471
I'm in a dance contest.

623
00:50:48,760 --> 00:50:50,591
- Where?
- The Palace.

624
00:50:51,679 --> 00:50:53,635
And you want my suit from Dad's
funeral?

625
00:50:53,720 --> 00:50:54,835
To go to Batista's playground?

626
00:50:56,359 --> 00:50:59,271
I want to win $5,000 on New Year's
Eve.

627
00:51:00,880 --> 00:51:03,440
Wiggling your ass
for all the American big shots.

628
00:51:03,519 --> 00:51:05,111
Cuban big shots, too.

629
00:51:11,479 --> 00:51:15,438
Susie, your mother and I
have some very disappointing news.

630
00:51:15,519 --> 00:51:17,635
I know you love
to decorate the Christmas tree

631
00:51:17,720 --> 00:51:19,756
and sing carols and watch home movies,

632
00:51:19,839 --> 00:51:23,718
but I'm afraid tonight We're all
gonna have to go to the Palace.

633
00:51:24,760 --> 00:51:27,672
- All of us?
- Yes, Susie, all of us.

634
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:32,197
I know it's your big night with James, but
could you save your old man one dance?

635
00:51:32,279 --> 00:51:35,077
- When did this happen?
- You know your father.

636
00:51:35,159 --> 00:51:37,070
Blabs to everyone we were dancers.

637
00:51:37,160 --> 00:51:39,833
So the Phelpses invited us
to the Latin ballroom contest,

638
00:51:39,920 --> 00:51:41,831
where I hear the dancing is pretty
good,

639
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:46,038
but your mother and I'll be
looking out for mistakes.

640
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:51,155
(Latin ballroom music)

641
00:51:53,520 --> 00:51:56,193
I can't wait to see the looks
on your parents' faces.

642
00:51:56,280 --> 00:51:57,633
Don't remind me.

643
00:51:57,720 --> 00:52:01,030
I really should be scolding you
for keeping her out till all hours.

644
00:52:01,119 --> 00:52:05,078
Don'tworry, ma'am. We've done nothing
you'd disapprove of. I can promise that.

645
00:52:05,160 --> 00:52:08,277
(singing in Spanish)

646
00:52:17,679 --> 00:52:19,670
- Thank you.
- Here.

647
00:52:19,759 --> 00:52:21,875
You two make a very cute couple.

648
00:52:21,959 --> 00:52:24,837
So many ofthe girls coming over
from the States these days

649
00:52:24,919 --> 00:52:27,228
get a little, you know, wild.

650
00:52:28,039 --> 00:52:30,507
You're lucky to have such lovely
daughters.

651
00:52:30,600 --> 00:52:32,909
(man) Ladies and gentlemen,
merry Christmas.

652
00:52:32,999 --> 00:52:36,594
In just a few moments we'll begin
this evening's special event.

653
00:52:36,680 --> 00:52:39,274
So when do we get to see
the championship dancers?

654
00:52:39,360 --> 00:52:43,353
- Oh, We're hardly champions.
- Oh, you'rejust being modest.

655
00:52:43,439 --> 00:52:46,829
Come on, I've never seen you guys
dance in public before.

656
00:52:47,799 --> 00:52:50,916
I thought that if your husband
didn't mind, you and I might...

657
00:52:50,999 --> 00:52:52,432
Oh.

658
00:52:52,519 --> 00:52:55,955
James, maybe Katey would like to
dance.

659
00:52:57,240 --> 00:52:59,231
Would you like to dance?

660
00:53:00,440 --> 00:53:02,351
I have to find the ladies' room.

661
00:53:02,440 --> 00:53:04,795
- I'll escort you.
- No, I'm fine.

662
00:53:04,879 --> 00:53:06,790
(singing in Spanish)

663
00:53:15,320 --> 00:53:16,753
- Where have you been?
- Sorry.

664
00:53:16,839 --> 00:53:18,989
This is a crazy idea.

665
00:53:19,079 --> 00:53:21,070
We're gonna win.

666
00:53:25,319 --> 00:53:29,995
(man) Here's the moment you have been
waiting for. The Latin ballroom competition.

667
00:53:30,079 --> 00:53:34,118
Three talented couples will be chosen to
compete in the finals on New Year's Eve.

668
00:53:34,199 --> 00:53:36,269
- Que bonita.
- Gracias.

669
00:53:36,360 --> 00:53:40,319

our three finalist couples for next
week.

732
00:57:03,760 --> 00:57:05,637
And they are...

733
00:57:05,719 --> 00:57:11,191
Couple number five,
José Melarde and Iris Mesa.

734
00:57:12,959 --> 00:57:18,591
Couple number nine,
Tino and Lourdes Martel.

735
00:57:21,520 --> 00:57:24,671
And couple number two,

736
00:57:25,559 --> 00:57:29,916
Javier Suarez and Katey Miller!

737
00:57:40,599 --> 00:57:43,830
What could we have possibly done
to make you wanna hurt us so much?

738
00:57:43,919 --> 00:57:47,309
You humiliate us in front of everyone,
including your father's boss.

739
00:57:47,400 --> 00:57:50,278
- Did you figure he'd lose his job...
- No one's losing their job.

740
00:57:50,360 --> 00:57:52,794
- You're gonna lose your job?
- No. Please, go to bed.

741
00:57:52,879 --> 00:57:55,313
- I didn't do anything to you.
- You lied to us.

742
00:57:55,399 --> 00:57:58,277
I know, and I'm sorry.
But I knew you wouldn't let me...

743
00:57:58,359 --> 00:58:01,874
Kiss a Cuban pool boy in front of
everyone? Damn straight, we wouldn't.

744
00:58:01,959 --> 00:58:05,588
Why in the world would you want to
hurt James? I thought you liked him.

745
00:58:05,679 --> 00:58:10,753
No, you liked him because he fits into
your perfect country-club world.

746
00:58:10,839 --> 00:58:14,275
- There's nothing wrong with that world.
- He couldn't keep his hands off me.

747
00:58:14,360 --> 00:58:18,512
- What? What happened?
- Nothing happened. I'm fine.

748
00:58:18,599 --> 00:58:21,591
- Why didn't you tell us?
- Because I didn't wanna mess up your job.

749
00:58:23,039 --> 00:58:27,476
Katey. How could you think that my job
would be more important than you?

750
00:58:29,880 --> 00:58:32,348
I didn't wanna hurt you.

751
00:58:33,439 --> 00:58:36,909
I just wanted to help Javier...
which is his name, by the way.

752
00:58:39,559 --> 00:58:42,198
Oh, God, I love dancing with him.

753
00:58:43,320 --> 00:58:45,231
Oh, Katey.

754
00:58:47,960 --> 00:58:50,793
Did it ever occur to you
that that boy might be using you?

755
00:58:50,880 --> 00:58:53,394
A nice American girl
who can be his ticket out of here?

756
00:58:53,479 --> 00:58:57,233
You may love dancing with him but there
are more important factors, like your future.

757
00:58:57,319 --> 00:59:02,996
Why does it have to be either or? You
gave up your passion but why should I?

758
00:59:08,920 --> 00:59:10,831
(father) Katey.

759
00:59:13,880 --> 00:59:16,440
Katey. Katey, wait.

760
00:59:16,520 --> 00:59:18,511
- Honey, wait.
- I'm going to Javier's.

761
00:59:18,599 --> 00:59:20,317
Your mother's trying to protect you.

762
00:59:20,399 --> 00:59:23,789
I'm gonna be up there on New Year's Eve
no matter what you and Mom think.

763
00:59:23,880 --> 00:59:25,711
No more lies.

764
00:59:31,159 --> 00:59:33,070
He's out celebrating.

765
00:59:33,880 --> 00:59:37,111
So if you want to wait for him...

766
00:59:39,399 --> 00:59:41,310
(click of phone receiver)

767
00:59:42,520 --> 00:59:44,476
That was Katey.

768
00:59:46,559 --> 00:59:48,993
It's OK. She's with his mother.

769
00:59:49,080 --> 00:59:52,152
- Was I wrong?
- No.

770
00:59:53,200 --> 00:59:56,192
But neither was Katey.

771
00:59:56,280 --> 00:59:58,748
Sometimes I wish we...

772
00:59:58,840 --> 01:00:03,470
Ijust try to imagine what it
would be like ifwe hadn't had...

773
01:00:07,080 --> 01:00:10,516
- Does it make me a bad mother?
- Of course not.

774
01:00:13,840 --> 01:00:16,434
You were good. It's OK to miss it.

775
01:00:18,960 --> 01:00:21,679
They sure spiced up our old routine,
didn't they?

776
01:00:21,760 --> 01:00:24,991
I'll say. That wouldn't have gone over
too well at Rose Lane, would it?

777
01:00:25,080 --> 01:00:26,991
No.

778
01:00:29,280 --> 01:00:32,272
Bert, she's not a little girl anymore.

779
01:00:51,960 --> 01:00:53,871
What are you reading?

780
01:00:56,600 --> 01:01:00,593
José Marti. It was my father's.

781
01:01:01,159 --> 01:01:05,755
We got rid of all his books just to
be safe, but I kept this one.

782
01:01:07,880 --> 01:01:09,791
Hello.

783
01:01:09,880 --> 01:01:11,916
- Javier?
- Yeah.

784
01:01:13,040 --> 01:01:15,508
- If we don't win the finals...
- We will.

785
01:01:16,279 --> 01:01:18,190
But if we don't...

786
01:01:19,760 --> 01:01:22,991
I'm not gonna go to college
in six months.

787
01:01:26,400 --> 01:01:30,598
You don't know how you are gonna
feel in six months.

788
01:01:30,680 --> 01:01:34,514
- Yes, I do.
- No. No, you don't.

789
01:01:36,399 --> 01:01:38,788
I don't want you
to give up your dreams for me.

790
01:01:38,880 --> 01:01:41,838
But I have new dreams now.

791
01:01:56,880 --> 01:02:02,716
(♪ "Have Yourself A Merry Little
Christmas" playing softly)

792
01:02:23,120 --> 01:02:26,112
Susie, why don't you and I
go raid that buffet by the pool?

793
01:02:26,200 --> 01:02:28,111
Sure.

794
01:02:38,959 --> 01:02:42,031
Tree looks nice.

795
01:02:46,760 --> 01:02:49,354
Your father and I discussed it...

796
01:02:52,960 --> 01:02:57,238
and we think that you should do
a double turn at the finals.

797
01:03:00,399 --> 01:03:02,629
You like the way I danced?

798
01:03:03,560 --> 01:03:06,233
Katey...

799
01:03:06,319 --> 01:03:09,709
if you're asking me to approve
of you and this boy, I can't.

800
01:03:10,720 --> 01:03:12,950
But the dancing...

801
01:03:14,840 --> 01:03:16,751
The dancing was incredible.

802
01:03:19,960 --> 01:03:22,554
I think I should take
a little credit for that.

803
01:03:23,640 --> 01:03:25,631
I think you should, too.

804
01:03:28,040 --> 01:03:29,598

805
01:03:41,360 --> 01:03:43,237
Javier, these are my parents.

806
01:03:43,319 --> 01:03:45,992
- Hi, Javier. It's nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you too.

807
01:03:46,080 --> 01:03:48,469
It's an honor
to meet such wonderful dancers.

808
01:03:48,560 --> 01:03:50,835
This is from my mother's garden.

809
01:03:51,520 --> 01:03:53,397
Thank you. That was sweet of you.

810
01:03:53,480 --> 01:03:55,710
- This is for you.
- Thanks.

#How could you do that?

837
01:08:08,079 --> 01:08:09,797

#With all those innocent people!

838
01:08:09,879 --> 01:08:11,790

#Everything would have been fine
if you hadn't screwed it up!

839
01:08:12,879 --> 01:08:15,188

#By killing people just like they do?

840
01:08:15,280 --> 01:08:17,032

#It's not the same!

841

#Those people in there killed our father!

842

someone else's father!

01:08:24,439 --> 01:08:26,475

#Dad would be ashamed of you.

01:08:36,959 --> 01:08:38,870

#No.

845
01:08:40,600 --> 01:08:42,511

so I don't know what it's like
to say goodbye to someone.

925
01:14:49,519 --> 01:14:53,751
Saying goodbye to dancing,
the other love of my life...

926
01:14:56,519 --> 01:14:59,079
it broke my heart.

927
01:15:03,600 --> 01:15:07,593
Then you were born, and then Susie,
and I loved you both so much that I...

928
01:15:07,679 --> 01:15:11,467

You can do nothing.
You can hide under the bed.

933
01:15:28,080 --> 01:15:30,355
