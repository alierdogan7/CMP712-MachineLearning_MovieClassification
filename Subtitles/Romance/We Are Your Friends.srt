1
00:00:22,833 --> 00:00:24,665
(dance music playing)

2
00:00:25,833 --> 00:00:27,624
- (music stops)
- (mouse clicks)

3
00:00:28,541 --> 00:00:30,457
(testing different dance beats)

4
00:00:31,083 --> 00:00:32,207
(mouse clicking)

5
00:00:36,458 --> 00:00:38,207
(dance music playing)

6
00:00:43,791 --> 00:00:44,874
(music stops)

7
00:00:45,041 --> 00:00:46,999
(isolated synth playing in lower key)

8
00:01:01,083 --> 00:01:03,290
(Mason) Well, it's gonna
be a big night, right?

9
00:01:03,375 --> 00:01:05,332
I mean, how much are we looking at?

10
00:01:05,416 --> 00:01:07,124
(Nicky on phone)
I'll give you five a head.

11
00:01:07,208 --> 00:01:08,749
(Mason) Five a head? Fuck you.

12
00:01:08,833 --> 00:01:10,624
There's tiki bars in Encino
that pay more than that.

13
00:01:10,708 --> 00:01:12,082
We're gonna pull out on you, then.

14
00:01:13,083 --> 00:01:15,415
How about I guarantee you 500 heads

15
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:17,790
and you fucking bump us up to seven?

16
00:01:17,875 --> 00:01:20,195
You pull 500 girls in the club,
I'll give you fucking head.

17
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:21,374
Wait, am I on speaker?

18
00:01:21,458 --> 00:01:22,749
(Mason) Yeah, my phone's broke.

19
00:01:22,833 --> 00:01:23,874
What time is Cole's set?

20
00:01:24,375 --> 00:01:26,332
Oh, yeah, Cole.
I got him down at 9:00 p.m.

21
00:01:26,416 --> 00:01:27,915
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

22
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,790
- Who's going on at 11:00?
- Uh, DJ Devin playing at 11:00.

23
00:01:30,916 --> 00:01:31,957
(mouthing)

24
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:35,790
Does DJ Devin have
25 Kappa Alpha Alpha mega-sluts

25
00:01:35,875 --> 00:01:37,540
coming in a fucking party bus?

26
00:01:37,625 --> 00:01:39,457
'Cause they ain't gonna be there
until 11:00.

27
00:01:39,541 --> 00:01:40,749
You know, be a fucking gentleman, Nicky.

28
00:01:41,041 --> 00:01:43,082
Be a gentleman? Fuck you, kid.

29
00:01:43,291 --> 00:01:44,957
11:00. And fix your goddamn phone.

30
00:01:45,041 --> 00:01:46,332
All right, bitch.

31
00:01:46,541 --> 00:01:47,665
(Cole laughing)

32
00:01:48,166 --> 00:01:49,832
I got you, boo!

33
00:01:49,916 --> 00:01:51,832
(grunts) Primetime!

34
00:01:52,375 --> 00:01:54,415
You know, it's a major night
for my boy, all right?

35
00:01:54,541 --> 00:01:55,582
Just, you know, cut loose.

36
00:01:55,666 --> 00:01:56,915
Bring whoever. Bring them all.

37
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,374
Bring them all.
The girl with the dimples.

38
00:01:58,458 --> 00:01:59,499
See you then.

39
00:02:00,333 --> 00:02:02,415
- 150 heads.
- Nice, man.

40
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:03,874
Ooh! No, thanks.

41
00:02:05,333 --> 00:02:08,207
(Mason) And the squirrel
came scurrying up the tree.

42
00:02:08,291 --> 00:02:09,790
Yo, yo.

43
00:02:09,875 --> 00:02:10,915
Get out. I'm driving.

44
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,207
- What?
- Get out. I'm driving.

45
00:02:18,708 --> 00:02:20,082
Get in. Get in. Come on.

46
00:02:20,958 --> 00:02:22,999
(Mason) There he is.

47
00:02:23,083 --> 00:02:25,707
Wearing a leather jacket
in the summertime.

48
00:02:25,791 --> 00:02:27,874
- Good afternoon, gentlemen.
- (Mason) Good God.

49
00:02:28,708 --> 00:02:31,874
Five, four, three,

50
00:02:32,916 --> 00:02:34,874
two, one.

51
00:02:34,958 --> 00:02:37,582
(school bell tolling)

52
00:02:47,125 --> 00:02:48,790
James Reed. Thursday. Social.

53
00:02:48,875 --> 00:02:51,075
You should come out to Social.
James Reed is headlining.

54
00:02:51,125 --> 00:02:53,290
How are you doing? Do you like, uh...
Do you like electronic music?

55
00:02:53,541 --> 00:02:55,624
Your nose job looks great.

56
00:02:56,416 --> 00:02:57,457
Do you promise?

57
00:02:57,541 --> 00:02:59,499
James Reed. Social. Thursdays.
Bring a friend.

58
00:02:59,583 --> 00:03:01,374
Bring all your friends.
If they look like you, bring 'em all.

59
00:03:01,458 --> 00:03:02,749
Here, here. All of you guys.

60
00:03:02,833 --> 00:03:04,415
Girl, you want to come out on Thursday?

61
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:05,665
James Reed is DJing.

62
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:07,624
Social. Thursdays.
I'll take care of you.

63
00:03:07,708 --> 00:03:08,749
Okay.

64
00:03:08,833 --> 00:03:09,999
Here, put your number in my phone.

65
00:03:10,083 --> 00:03:11,665
If you guys bring, like,
a couple of friends,

66
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:13,999
I can get you a free bottle.
It's Cole, by the way.

67
00:03:14,083 --> 00:03:16,124
See you Thursday.

68
00:03:16,208 --> 00:03:17,408
I should have gone to college.

69
00:03:18,708 --> 00:03:21,957
(Cole) This is the San Fernando Valley,
that flat stretch of land on the

70
00:03:22,041 --> 00:03:23,499
other side of the Hollywood Hills.

71
00:03:25,916 --> 00:03:28,082
Our greatest contributions
to American culture

72
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:30,582
remain the porn industry
and ditsy girls.

73
00:03:30,666 --> 00:03:33,415
But we've also got the best sushi
in the western hemisphere.

74
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:36,124
And it's always in a strip mall. Always.

75
00:03:37,125 --> 00:03:38,624
That's my friend Mason's house.

76
00:03:38,708 --> 00:03:41,749
And that's the pool house in the back
where I've been living since I was 15.

77
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:45,124
That's where we threw down
with some punks from Canoga Park

78
00:03:45,208 --> 00:03:46,749
and I got this awesome scar.

79
00:03:46,833 --> 00:03:48,915
And these are my friends.

80
00:04:07,666 --> 00:04:11,249
Yo, yo. The fact is that 99%
of all people in this world,

81
00:04:11,333 --> 00:04:12,874
they're looking for a party. Okay?

82
00:04:12,958 --> 00:04:14,478
And 1 % of people, they are the party.

83
00:04:14,541 --> 00:04:15,707
You gotta fucking be that.

84
00:04:15,791 --> 00:04:19,249
You know, your body is 85% water
and I'm thirsty. I'm thirsty.

85
00:04:19,333 --> 00:04:21,413
This isn't some unce unce
bridge-and-tunnel bullshit.

86
00:04:21,458 --> 00:04:23,582
This is the best dance party in LA.

87
00:04:23,666 --> 00:04:24,874
And that guy right there...

88
00:04:24,958 --> 00:04:26,415
- He's DJing.
- I'm DJing.

89
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:27,707
Just the side room, though.

90
00:04:27,791 --> 00:04:28,832
It's just the side room.

91
00:04:28,916 --> 00:04:30,516
(Cole) These days you can invent an app,

92
00:04:30,541 --> 00:04:32,790
start a blog,
sell shit online.

93
00:04:32,875 --> 00:04:34,582
But if you're a DJ, all you need

94
00:04:34,666 --> 00:04:37,082
is a laptop, some talent and one track.

95
00:04:37,458 --> 00:04:39,290
That track is your ticket to everything.

96
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:42,040
(♫ We Are Your Friends
by Justice Vs Simian)

97
00:04:46,083 --> 00:04:48,915
Man, DJing, producing, look, it's hard.

98
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,040
It's a saturated market.

99
00:04:50,125 --> 00:04:52,249
Yeah. 'Cause there's not
enough actors in LA.

100
00:04:52,333 --> 00:04:53,707
I'm not an actor.

101
00:04:54,041 --> 00:04:55,165
I'm a movie star.

102
00:04:55,958 --> 00:04:57,499
This is gonna be the best...

103
00:04:57,583 --> 00:04:58,749
- The best...
- The best...

104
00:04:58,833 --> 00:05:00,249
- The best night...
- The best night...

105
00:05:00,333 --> 00:05:02,415
(all) The best night of your life.

106
00:05:06,416 --> 00:05:08,582
(Mason) You're so fucking pretty, Ollie.
Like an angel.

107
00:05:08,666 --> 00:05:11,790
(Ollie) Get off me. You smell like shit.

108
00:05:12,958 --> 00:05:14,332
(Ollie) This one's off Beachwood.

109
00:05:14,416 --> 00:05:16,582
Four bedrooms, a party deck.

110
00:05:16,666 --> 00:05:19,582
Two hundred square-foot dining room.
Perfect for entertaining.

111
00:05:19,666 --> 00:05:21,457
You know, we could turn
the dining room into our office.

112
00:05:21,541 --> 00:05:25,207
Mase, uh, dude,
the cheapest place here is six grand.

113
00:05:25,416 --> 00:05:27,165
I mean, you don't have
enough money to fix your car.

114
00:05:27,416 --> 00:05:28,499
Hey!

115
00:05:28,583 --> 00:05:30,665
- With Ollie's drug money...
- Shut up.

116
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:32,249
...and our nights at Social
blowing up, okay,

117
00:05:32,333 --> 00:05:34,915
we're gonna be out of the Valley
by the end of this summer.

118
00:05:35,666 --> 00:05:37,624
Okay? And I feel...

119
00:05:37,708 --> 00:05:39,165
Look, I feel really
fucking good about Thursday.

120
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:40,540
I mean, like so good.

121
00:05:40,625 --> 00:05:42,540
Like when Jenna Haze
put her finger up my asshole, dude,

122
00:05:42,625 --> 00:05:43,915
like that kind of good.

123
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,082
That was your finger.

124
00:05:45,166 --> 00:05:46,249
That was your finger.

125
00:05:46,333 --> 00:05:48,893
- I'm pretty sure she wasn't even there.
- Jenna Haze's finger...

126
00:05:48,958 --> 00:05:51,582
Listen. Believe in me.
Cos I believe in you.

127
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:53,749
(all chuckling)

128
00:05:55,208 --> 00:05:57,457
What's up, kids? Good to see you, bro.

129
00:05:57,541 --> 00:05:59,290
- You're looking sharp as ever, Paige.
- Yeah, you, too, man.

130
00:05:59,375 --> 00:06:02,207
You know my boys.
Squirrel, Cole and Mason.

131
00:06:02,291 --> 00:06:05,332
What's up? Young hustlers' club.
I like it, I like it.

132
00:06:05,416 --> 00:06:07,790
We prefer to be
called entrepreneurs but, uh...

133
00:06:08,041 --> 00:06:10,665
You're an entrepreneur!
My kind of guy.

134
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:12,999
Paige, man, you should come to
the new spot, Social, on Thursday.

135
00:06:13,083 --> 00:06:14,207
- Social?
- I'll take care of you.

136
00:06:14,291 --> 00:06:15,707
(Paige) You're gonna
take care of me, huh?

137
00:06:15,791 --> 00:06:16,957
- (Ollie) That's right.
- Tell you what,

138
00:06:17,041 --> 00:06:19,082
whenever you guys are ready
to start making some real loot,

139
00:06:19,166 --> 00:06:21,457
you need to holler at me,
you know, bring the boys.

140
00:06:22,083 --> 00:06:24,082
You do that. Think about it, huh?

141
00:06:24,166 --> 00:06:26,624
I'll tell you what, brunch is on me,
all right, fellas?

142
00:06:26,708 --> 00:06:28,957
Bye-bye. (Speaking Russian)

143
00:06:31,916 --> 00:06:34,040
What's he talking about, money?
What money?

144
00:06:34,208 --> 00:06:35,488
Man, Paige is always recruiting.

145
00:06:36,375 --> 00:06:37,975
For what?
Doesn't he, like, produce porn?

146
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,582
No, he's in real estate, assface.

147
00:06:39,666 --> 00:06:41,332
Couldn't he just, like,
get us a house, then?

148
00:06:41,416 --> 00:06:42,499
- No.
- We're here talking about houses...

149
00:06:42,583 --> 00:06:45,082
No, no, no. He's like
a real estate businessman.

150
00:06:48,041 --> 00:06:49,499
What does that mean?

151
00:06:49,583 --> 00:06:51,082
I don't know what that is.

152
00:06:51,166 --> 00:06:53,665
Okay, I'm not exactly sure what he does.

153
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:54,999
But... (whistles)

154
00:06:55,083 --> 00:06:56,523
He's making a lot of money doing it.

155
00:06:57,333 --> 00:06:58,874
Oof!

156
00:07:01,791 --> 00:07:03,999
(electronic keyboard playing)

157
00:07:12,416 --> 00:07:14,290
(Mason growling)

158
00:07:17,375 --> 00:07:18,457
(growls)

159
00:07:22,541 --> 00:07:23,707
(snarls)

160
00:07:30,916 --> 00:07:32,374
Mason.

161
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,249
Mason.

162
00:07:35,375 --> 00:07:38,290
I asked you three times
to work on that roof yesterday.

163
00:07:39,166 --> 00:07:40,707
The toilet's still broken.

164
00:07:40,791 --> 00:07:42,624
Okay. I'll fucking do it later.

165
00:07:42,708 --> 00:07:43,874
Now.

166
00:07:43,958 --> 00:07:46,582
- Okay.
- You, too, Cole.

167
00:07:49,083 --> 00:07:51,415
Sorry, my dad's such a dick.

168
00:08:01,541 --> 00:08:03,165
(nail gun firing)

169
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:21,832
(Ollie) Later, Pop.

170
00:08:29,416 --> 00:08:31,499
(whooping)

171
00:08:31,583 --> 00:08:32,624
Cheers.

172
00:08:32,708 --> 00:08:34,707
All right, this is for you.

173
00:08:34,791 --> 00:08:36,749
I got one. I got one. I got one.

174
00:08:37,125 --> 00:08:39,832
This moment right here,
with all of you guys,

175
00:08:39,916 --> 00:08:43,332
this is honestly
my favourite part of the night.

176
00:08:43,416 --> 00:08:46,582
It's the moment before it starts.

177
00:08:46,666 --> 00:08:47,957
(all cheering)

178
00:09:12,541 --> 00:09:14,499
Mason. Mason, where's my 500, bro?

179
00:09:14,916 --> 00:09:16,374
You see the fucking line outside?

180
00:09:16,458 --> 00:09:18,165
You can wait to thank me
till the end of the night, kid.

181
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:20,415
Hey, you. Do not play
any of the songs on that list.

182
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:21,624
You understand me?

183
00:09:21,708 --> 00:09:23,457
Save Firepower for Mr Reed.

184
00:09:23,541 --> 00:09:25,832
Ooh! Hello, beautiful.

185
00:09:25,916 --> 00:09:28,582
You look so fucking important
with that list in your hand.

186
00:09:28,666 --> 00:09:30,082
Here you go.

187
00:09:30,166 --> 00:09:31,874
- What's up, Devin?
- What's up, Cole?

188
00:09:31,958 --> 00:09:33,082
- How are you doing?
- I'm good, man.

189
00:09:33,166 --> 00:09:34,166
- Good.
- Yeah.

190
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:36,124
Warming the room up for you.
It's all good.

191
00:09:36,208 --> 00:09:37,207
- Thanks, bro.
- Hey, buddy.

192
00:09:37,291 --> 00:09:38,999
All right, have fun, man.

193
00:09:40,208 --> 00:09:41,249
What a dick.

194
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:43,249
Yo, Ollie, my main man. How you doing?

195
00:09:43,333 --> 00:09:45,665
Good, good, good.
Look, hook me up with another round.

196
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:47,830
I'll throw you a Vine,
I'll make you famous and shit.

197
00:09:47,875 --> 00:09:48,875
All right, I got you.

198
00:09:48,958 --> 00:09:50,332
You guys let me know
if you need anything, all right?

199
00:09:50,416 --> 00:09:51,416
Off the menu.

200
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:53,082
Hey, hey, bro, bro.

201
00:09:53,166 --> 00:09:54,707
I'm boys with your friend.

202
00:09:54,791 --> 00:09:56,124
You know, Ollie, the pretty boy?

203
00:09:56,208 --> 00:09:58,832
Ah. Sorry, kid, I'm fucking sorry.

204
00:09:58,916 --> 00:09:59,999
Wait. What about this guy?

205
00:10:01,083 --> 00:10:02,457
You know him?

206
00:10:06,625 --> 00:10:08,290
Don't "bro" me if you don't know me.

207
00:10:08,375 --> 00:10:09,665
(chuckles)

208
00:10:13,291 --> 00:10:14,749
(sighs) This party sucks.

209
00:10:14,833 --> 00:10:17,165
- LA is dead.
- (both) Hi, Sarah.

210
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:19,749
Hey, Cole, can you play Drunk in Love?

211
00:10:21,041 --> 00:10:22,332
Absolutely not.

212
00:10:23,625 --> 00:10:25,707
Hey, Squirrel, I like your shirt.

213
00:10:29,416 --> 00:10:31,874
(electronic dance music playing)

214
00:10:36,666 --> 00:10:38,290
(inaudible)

215
00:10:56,041 --> 00:10:57,582
Ow! What the hell?

216
00:10:57,666 --> 00:10:59,665
We gotta round up chicks for Paige.

217
00:11:00,208 --> 00:11:01,582
(Cole) Looks like he's doing fine.

218
00:11:01,666 --> 00:11:04,540
Those girls are wack.
All right, find me something.

219
00:11:57,625 --> 00:11:59,707
What do you think of this guy?

220
00:11:59,791 --> 00:12:01,999
- This guy?
- Yeah.

221
00:12:05,125 --> 00:12:07,207
(girl) I think
he's getting paid too much.

222
00:12:07,916 --> 00:12:09,915
What do you think about him?

223
00:12:11,833 --> 00:12:13,790
(Cole) I think he used to be good.

224
00:12:15,083 --> 00:12:17,249
Now I think he just gives
the people what they want.

225
00:12:25,333 --> 00:12:27,665
Hey, do you wanna come
sit at my friend's table?

226
00:12:28,333 --> 00:12:29,499
You can drink for free.

227
00:12:31,041 --> 00:12:32,999
Do you promote here?

228
00:12:33,083 --> 00:12:34,083
No.

229
00:12:34,625 --> 00:12:37,499
My friends promote here.

230
00:12:38,125 --> 00:12:39,915
- Right.
- I kind of help them.

231
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,999
- Well, have a nice night.
- I...

232
00:12:47,833 --> 00:12:49,665
(crowd cheering)

233
00:13:15,791 --> 00:13:17,457
Hey. You're James Reed, right?

234
00:13:18,583 --> 00:13:19,874
Mm-hm.

235
00:13:20,666 --> 00:13:21,874
Do you smoke?

236
00:13:23,166 --> 00:13:24,624
Yes, I do.

237
00:13:29,625 --> 00:13:30,625
(coughing)

238
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:32,957
- What the fuck is that?
- What?

239
00:13:33,208 --> 00:13:34,665
- Is there tobacco in that?
- Yeah.

240
00:13:35,083 --> 00:13:36,415
- It's a spliff.
- A "spliff"?

241
00:13:36,541 --> 00:13:37,665
What are you, French?

242
00:13:38,291 --> 00:13:40,582
No. I'm American.

243
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:42,915
All right. This is the most
important advice you're ever gonna get.

244
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,749
Never mix THC with nicotine.

245
00:13:45,833 --> 00:13:47,082
It fogs up the high.

246
00:13:47,916 --> 00:13:49,290
It'll last longer if you mix it.

247
00:13:49,541 --> 00:13:52,582
It's not about making it last longer,
it's about enjoying it.

248
00:13:56,750 --> 00:13:58,082
You spin here regularly?

249
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:01,915
Yeah.

250
00:14:02,958 --> 00:14:04,207
- And they pay you?
- Mmm.

251
00:14:04,291 --> 00:14:05,624
No.

252
00:14:08,208 --> 00:14:09,957
But the drinks are free.

253
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:12,082
Well, that's nice of them.

254
00:14:16,041 --> 00:14:17,915
You wanna go to a party?

255
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:21,374
- What, like now?
- Yeah. Right now.

256
00:14:22,208 --> 00:14:23,374
It should be fun.

257
00:14:24,875 --> 00:14:26,040
Yeah.

258
00:14:29,333 --> 00:14:30,582
You want?

259
00:14:31,041 --> 00:14:32,332
Yeah, sure.

260
00:14:33,125 --> 00:14:35,457
So, like, where have
you been to, to spin?

261
00:14:37,083 --> 00:14:40,249
Okay. Tokyo, Berlin, Frankfurt...

262
00:14:41,041 --> 00:14:42,749
Uh, Belgium.

263
00:14:42,833 --> 00:14:44,624
Dubai, which is in the...

264
00:14:44,708 --> 00:14:46,207
Yeah, it's like the Vegas
of the Middle East.

265
00:14:46,291 --> 00:14:51,290
Ibiza, Majorca, Madrid, Paris.

266
00:14:51,375 --> 00:14:53,055
Paris, they got some
great music right now.

267
00:14:54,750 --> 00:14:56,499
Yo, you seen Cole?

268
00:14:56,583 --> 00:14:57,707
Can't say I have.

269
00:14:57,791 --> 00:14:58,915
Then what's the plan?

270
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:00,915
See you in the morning.

271
00:15:04,083 --> 00:15:05,874
(indistinct conversations)

272
00:15:20,166 --> 00:15:22,040
Whoa, whoa, whoa, easy.

273
00:15:22,583 --> 00:15:24,624
That painting is worth more than my car.

274
00:15:30,875 --> 00:15:32,165
James?

275
00:15:33,458 --> 00:15:35,040
Mmm-hmm?

276
00:15:36,208 --> 00:15:37,624
This painting is alive.

277
00:15:42,083 --> 00:15:43,207
Nah.

278
00:15:43,958 --> 00:15:46,207
It's just the PCP talking.

279
00:15:48,458 --> 00:15:50,332
PCP?

280
00:15:57,125 --> 00:15:59,499
Well, I've seen many door girls
in my day

281
00:15:59,583 --> 00:16:00,583
- but this one...
- Look.

282
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:03,582
I will go home with you tonight
under two conditions.

283
00:16:03,666 --> 00:16:08,290
One, you understand that it is pity sex
and I will never admit to it.

284
00:16:08,375 --> 00:16:12,790
And two, you shut the fuck up
for the rest of the night.

285
00:16:12,875 --> 00:16:13,999
Okay?

286
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:18,540
- (Sarah) Where are those nuts, Squirrel?
- (car alarm blaring)

287
00:16:18,708 --> 00:16:19,957
Where did you hide your fucking nuts?

288
00:16:20,041 --> 00:16:21,681
- It ain't winter yet.
- (Squirrel groans)

289
00:16:21,958 --> 00:16:24,624
(electronic dance music playing)

290
00:17:45,208 --> 00:17:46,249
(gasps)

291
00:18:20,625 --> 00:18:21,832
What are you doing here?

292
00:18:24,666 --> 00:18:27,540
Um, me and James
went to a party, I think.

293
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:30,957
- What are you doing here?
- (James yawning)

294
00:18:31,375 --> 00:18:33,707
- I live here.
- Oh my god!

295
00:18:33,791 --> 00:18:35,165
My brain is bleeding.

296
00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:38,832
My blood is going to start
coming out of my eyeballs.

297
00:18:38,916 --> 00:18:40,499
You like this homeless puppy I found?

298
00:18:40,583 --> 00:18:42,124
Is he housebroken?

299
00:18:42,208 --> 00:18:43,790
I don't know. Check the rugs.

300
00:18:45,166 --> 00:18:47,957
I can actually smell the whisky
coming out of your skin.

301
00:18:48,041 --> 00:18:49,082
Mmm?

302
00:18:49,166 --> 00:18:50,957
You didn't drive home
last night, did you?

303
00:18:51,041 --> 00:18:52,999
You used to smell
like fermented liquor, too.

304
00:18:53,083 --> 00:18:55,540
Cole, this is Sophie, my role model.

305
00:18:56,458 --> 00:18:57,999
Nice to meet you, Cole.

306
00:18:58,083 --> 00:18:59,083
Nice to meet you.

307
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:02,665
You were talking
a big game last night, kid.

308
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:04,082
(sighs) I was?

309
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:07,249
You were saying,
"All I need is one track."

310
00:19:07,458 --> 00:19:10,749
You were gonna control people's hearts,
fly around the world. (Chuckles)

311
00:19:11,458 --> 00:19:13,249
I'm not supposed to drink whisky.

312
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,082
Or take PCP.

313
00:19:16,666 --> 00:19:17,666
Uh...

314
00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:19,374
Do you have any aspirin?

315
00:19:19,458 --> 00:19:22,582
We have tonnes of aspirin
but I'm not giving you shit

316
00:19:22,666 --> 00:19:24,040
until you play me something.

317
00:19:24,291 --> 00:19:25,771
You have tracks on your phone, right?

318
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:28,415
(sighs) Okay.

319
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:29,749
It's not really morning music.

320
00:19:29,833 --> 00:19:32,374
Oh, well, that's okay
because it's 12:30.

321
00:19:32,583 --> 00:19:33,583
(James) It's 12:30?

322
00:19:35,666 --> 00:19:37,915
(electronic music playing on phone)

323
00:19:56,916 --> 00:19:58,540
I'm just gonna skip ahead.

324
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:11,707
It's fun.

325
00:20:12,291 --> 00:20:13,332
"Fun"?

326
00:20:13,416 --> 00:20:16,915
I'm gonna pour myself a drink
before this hangover gets real.

327
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,082
Soph, can we get Cole an Uber?

328
00:20:19,916 --> 00:20:20,916
(Sophie) Um...

329
00:20:21,458 --> 00:20:22,458
I can give him a ride.

330
00:20:22,541 --> 00:20:23,874
I have some errands to run, so...

331
00:20:23,958 --> 00:20:27,415
Great! I'll be here, festering slowly.

332
00:20:34,208 --> 00:20:36,040
You know, James is a snob.

333
00:20:36,125 --> 00:20:37,499
He's really hard on everyone.

334
00:20:38,291 --> 00:20:40,374
- So...
- Oh, don't worry, it's cool.

335
00:20:40,458 --> 00:20:42,124
It's not...

336
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:45,832
(Cole chuckles)

337
00:20:50,458 --> 00:20:51,707
Stanford, huh?

338
00:20:52,458 --> 00:20:53,540
That's a nice school.

339
00:20:54,791 --> 00:20:56,040
Do you go to college?

340
00:20:56,125 --> 00:20:57,290
No.

341
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,207
- I could have gone to college.
- Mmm.

342
00:21:01,291 --> 00:21:03,332
I could have run track at UC Davis.

343
00:21:03,625 --> 00:21:04,874
Why... Why didn't you?

344
00:21:05,708 --> 00:21:07,249
Well...

345
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:10,499
School is a waste of time.

346
00:21:12,166 --> 00:21:15,207
It can be if you're doing
something better with your time.

347
00:21:20,583 --> 00:21:23,915
(Mason) I can't believe you got
in there with Sarah.

348
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,707
Dicks.

349
00:21:25,791 --> 00:21:28,790
(Squirrel) She did unspeakable things.

350
00:21:28,875 --> 00:21:31,832
This girl straight beat my ass.
I thought I was strong, man.

351
00:21:32,875 --> 00:21:34,832
Supposed to call me later.
Whatever.

352
00:21:34,916 --> 00:21:38,165
Gentlemen, your earnings.

353
00:21:38,250 --> 00:21:39,624
(Squirrel) Hey, hey.

354
00:21:42,083 --> 00:21:43,499
At ease.

355
00:21:49,666 --> 00:21:51,415
200 bucks?

356
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:52,749
What the fuck is this, man?

357
00:21:52,833 --> 00:21:54,832
We brought in 560 people last night.

358
00:21:54,916 --> 00:21:56,040
We brought in 562.

359
00:21:56,125 --> 00:21:57,790
I thought that was the point of this,
we bring in 500...

360
00:21:57,875 --> 00:22:01,082
I'm gonna fucking murder
that cheesy motherfucker!

361
00:22:04,875 --> 00:22:07,457
I just read about this guy, right,
who invented Instagram.

362
00:22:07,541 --> 00:22:09,040
He sold it for $400 million.

363
00:22:09,666 --> 00:22:10,915
So?

364
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,249
Man, he was 26 years old.

365
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:14,124
I mean, he spent the next
fucking year of his life

366
00:22:14,208 --> 00:22:17,249
flying around the world, taking pictures
of his girlfriend on different beaches.

367
00:22:17,333 --> 00:22:19,624
- Kevin Systrom.
- What?

368
00:22:19,708 --> 00:22:20,708
It's Kevin Systrom.

369
00:22:20,791 --> 00:22:23,124
The guy who invented Instagram,
his name is Kevin Systrom.

370
00:22:23,208 --> 00:22:24,374
Fuck Kevin Systrom!

371
00:22:25,875 --> 00:22:29,165
Dude, I live for Thursdays.
The club is my thing.

372
00:22:29,250 --> 00:22:30,624
Yeah, man. I'm not saying
we should quit altogether

373
00:22:30,708 --> 00:22:31,957
but aren't you tired of taking taxis

374
00:22:32,041 --> 00:22:33,415
back from fucking Silver Lake
every night?

375
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:35,874
I'm tired of taking Squirrel's
mom's fucking station wagon.

376
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,915
Okay. I'm tired of driving
your bum ass around.

377
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,440
I'm fucking tired of you
jerking off five feet from my pillow.

378
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:42,290
You're not gonna get tired of that ever.

379
00:22:42,375 --> 00:22:44,124
You guys want to make real money?

380
00:22:44,208 --> 00:22:46,168
Or you want to fucking
live and die in the Valley?

381
00:22:51,958 --> 00:22:53,290
Look, I have an idea.

382
00:22:53,958 --> 00:22:58,290
(Paige) In my life, I do not rely
on anything that's not concrete.

383
00:22:58,916 --> 00:23:01,082
All this abstract, computerised,

384
00:23:01,166 --> 00:23:04,749
digitised, on-paper bullshit
is for pussies.

385
00:23:13,125 --> 00:23:15,332
Fuck a diamond, that shit's forever.

386
00:23:15,625 --> 00:23:17,457
Hi, Mrs Henderson?

387
00:23:17,541 --> 00:23:20,415
Hi, I'm calling from
Gold Star Realty Solutions.

388
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:21,749
Hi, my name is Cole.

389
00:23:21,833 --> 00:23:23,832
I'm calling from
Gold Star Realty Solutions.

390
00:23:24,083 --> 00:23:26,915
This is a list of homeowners in the area

391
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:30,374
that are in the unfortunate
position of facing foreclosure.

392
00:23:30,458 --> 00:23:34,999
I was wondering if I could talk to, uh,
a Mr Stein? Uh, Mr "Steen"?

393
00:23:35,083 --> 00:23:36,374
So we're cold-calling people?

394
00:23:36,458 --> 00:23:37,499
No, no, no, no.

395
00:23:37,583 --> 00:23:39,957
You are calling people who are in need,

396
00:23:40,041 --> 00:23:41,761
with the solution
that they are looking for.

397
00:23:41,833 --> 00:23:43,707
When you call these people,

398
00:23:43,791 --> 00:23:46,165
you're calling as their friend.

399
00:23:47,958 --> 00:23:51,624
We charge $5,000 to negotiate
their foreclosures with the banks.

400
00:23:51,916 --> 00:23:55,624
Every deal you close, I give you 15%.

401
00:23:55,916 --> 00:23:57,249
Well, that's like 600...

402
00:23:57,333 --> 00:23:58,707
$750.

403
00:23:58,791 --> 00:24:00,957
Boom. Good fucking math, kid.

404
00:24:01,666 --> 00:24:04,665
Now to, uh, restore
your faith in humanity,

405
00:24:04,791 --> 00:24:08,707
let me break you off
something real proper-like.

406
00:24:08,791 --> 00:24:10,207
Welcome to the kingdom, boys.

407
00:24:15,041 --> 00:24:16,207
That's like 1,000 bucks at least.

408
00:24:16,291 --> 00:24:17,291
Oh!

409
00:24:17,375 --> 00:24:19,582
Smell it, smell it.

410
00:24:20,458 --> 00:24:23,040
(Ollie) Let's do this. Let's do this.
Come on. It's a good thing.

411
00:24:31,166 --> 00:24:33,290
- (saw whirring)
- (Mason) So, Dad,

412
00:24:33,958 --> 00:24:36,540
me and Cole, we're making some money,
and I thought maybe...

413
00:24:36,625 --> 00:24:38,624
(phone rings, vibrates)

414
00:24:41,916 --> 00:24:43,957
- Hello?
- (James) Yo, San Fernando.

415
00:24:44,041 --> 00:24:45,749
- It's James.
- What's up, man?

416
00:24:45,833 --> 00:24:47,290
What are you doing Saturday?

417
00:24:48,166 --> 00:24:50,040
Uh, nothing. Nothing. Why?

418
00:24:50,125 --> 00:24:51,790
You wanna make some cash?

419
00:24:52,916 --> 00:24:53,957
Doing what?

420
00:25:00,041 --> 00:25:01,665
(electronic dance music playing)

421
00:25:06,958 --> 00:25:08,915
(inaudible)

422
00:25:22,583 --> 00:25:25,207
Hey, can you play Drunk in Love?

423
00:25:26,458 --> 00:25:27,458
Uh...

424
00:25:27,958 --> 00:25:29,457
Please?

425
00:25:29,541 --> 00:25:31,124
Yeah, sure, I'll try to work it in.

426
00:25:32,291 --> 00:25:33,957
For you, sir, from James.

427
00:25:35,291 --> 00:25:36,415
What, are you, like, his secretary now?

428
00:25:36,541 --> 00:25:38,290
His assistant, actually.

429
00:25:39,916 --> 00:25:42,165
Oh, you look so surprised.

430
00:25:43,375 --> 00:25:44,499
Wow!

431
00:25:44,583 --> 00:25:45,707
Oh, I'm sorry.

432
00:25:45,791 --> 00:25:47,249
Were you trying to tell her
all about the free drinks

433
00:25:47,333 --> 00:25:48,957
you can get her on Thursdays?

434
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,000
What's in there? Rosé?

435
00:25:54,875 --> 00:25:55,915
Here.

436
00:26:02,041 --> 00:26:03,957
- Club soda.
- With cranberry.

437
00:26:04,041 --> 00:26:05,041
Very stealth.

438
00:26:08,666 --> 00:26:10,999
Hey, you know, this party's looking
a little stiff, Cole.

439
00:26:11,875 --> 00:26:14,040
So what are you saying?
Do I need to amp it up?

440
00:26:14,125 --> 00:26:17,249
You could try but this crowd
doesn't dance before midnight.

441
00:26:18,541 --> 00:26:19,790
Okay.

442
00:26:20,958 --> 00:26:22,707
(Cole speaking)

443
00:26:23,125 --> 00:26:24,165
(electronic music playing)

444
00:26:24,250 --> 00:26:25,250
So it's the DJ's job

445
00:26:25,333 --> 00:26:27,040
to get the crowd out of their heads
and into their bodies.

446
00:26:27,583 --> 00:26:28,583
So in order to do that,

447
00:26:28,666 --> 00:26:29,832
you need at the very least...

448
00:26:32,166 --> 00:26:33,646
...a cursory knowledge of mathematics

449
00:26:33,958 --> 00:26:36,374
and the broad strokes
of 9th-grade biology.

450
00:26:36,541 --> 00:26:40,249
For example, the bassline controls
this region of the body right here.

451
00:26:42,458 --> 00:26:43,874
The most important region.

452
00:26:47,625 --> 00:26:50,665
There's always going to be resistance,
so you gotta be patient.

453
00:26:50,750 --> 00:26:54,249
Look for that one person
who's not afraid to just go for it.

454
00:27:16,750 --> 00:27:19,499
Next, you want to zero in
on their heartbeats.

455
00:27:19,583 --> 00:27:22,624
I like start them off
at about 120 beats per minute.

456
00:27:22,708 --> 00:27:25,707
That's equivalent to the heartbeat
of a long-distance runner.

457
00:27:33,416 --> 00:27:35,374
You see, BPM is the name of the game.

458
00:27:39,291 --> 00:27:40,874
About 60 BPM.

459
00:27:45,333 --> 00:27:46,832
(dubstep music playing)

460
00:27:47,458 --> 00:27:50,665
Dubstep is actually 140
BPMs cut to half-speed,

461
00:27:50,750 --> 00:27:52,374
it ends up being about 70 BPMs.

462
00:27:52,625 --> 00:27:53,749
(house music playing)

463
00:27:53,833 --> 00:27:57,332
House is around 110 to 130 BPMs.

464
00:27:59,250 --> 00:28:01,332
(hardcore music playing)

465
00:28:01,416 --> 00:28:02,832
I'm not sure how you dance to that.

466
00:28:03,750 --> 00:28:07,457
Once you've locked onto their heartrate,
you start bringing 'em up song by song.

467
00:28:07,750 --> 00:28:09,499
(electronic music playing)

468
00:28:39,291 --> 00:28:42,040
There's a popular myth
that 128 beats per minute

469
00:28:42,125 --> 00:28:44,205
is the rate that synergises most
with your heartbeat.

470
00:28:53,250 --> 00:28:54,499
That's the magic number.

471
00:28:55,083 --> 00:28:56,523
Once you've gotten your crowd there,

472
00:28:56,833 --> 00:29:00,332
you're controlling
their entire circulatory system.

473
00:29:39,916 --> 00:29:41,415
Hey, man, would you mind
watching this for me?

474
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:42,749
- Oh, yeah, sure.
- Thanks, man.

475
00:29:46,125 --> 00:29:47,457
What are you guys doing here?

476
00:29:47,541 --> 00:29:48,874
What do you mean, what am I doing here?

477
00:29:48,958 --> 00:29:51,598
We wouldn't come all the way out
here to pick you up and not party.

478
00:29:52,208 --> 00:29:54,040
Hey, James. They're with me.

479
00:29:54,125 --> 00:29:55,374
This is Mason, Ollie and Squirrel.

480
00:29:55,458 --> 00:29:56,999
How's it going?

481
00:29:57,083 --> 00:29:58,083
Nice to meet you all.

482
00:29:58,166 --> 00:30:00,749
Actually, you met us before.
We promote at Social on Thursdays.

483
00:30:01,416 --> 00:30:03,499
Listen, we should grab a bite
to eat sometime, man.

484
00:30:03,583 --> 00:30:05,540
I'm basically
this kid's fucking manager,

485
00:30:05,625 --> 00:30:06,957
you know what I mean?

486
00:30:07,041 --> 00:30:08,749
And I think we could use
a little bit of advice.

487
00:30:08,833 --> 00:30:10,415
You know what, just enjoy the party.

488
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:12,290
We'll talk shop another time.

489
00:30:13,458 --> 00:30:14,999
Nice to meet you, bro.

490
00:30:15,083 --> 00:30:16,582
(James) Hey, Cole,
I want to show you something...

491
00:30:16,666 --> 00:30:18,374
Just be cool.

492
00:30:19,208 --> 00:30:21,415
I'm like the coolest fucking dude ever.
I don't know...

493
00:30:25,083 --> 00:30:26,832
Are you kidding me?

494
00:30:29,208 --> 00:30:30,540
You have a Wurlitzer?

495
00:30:32,916 --> 00:30:35,040
(playing mellow music) Wow.

496
00:30:39,875 --> 00:30:41,707
Well, that's not bad.

497
00:30:42,458 --> 00:30:44,165
My mom taught piano.

498
00:30:45,083 --> 00:30:46,499
Yeah? She still teach?

499
00:30:48,583 --> 00:30:49,790
Maybe.

500
00:30:51,458 --> 00:30:53,374
I wanna show you something.

501
00:30:56,833 --> 00:30:59,540
This is called a Buchla.

502
00:31:00,375 --> 00:31:01,540
It's a mod synth.

503
00:31:02,083 --> 00:31:04,040
There's only a couple of them
in the world.

504
00:31:04,125 --> 00:31:06,124
Bowie used one of these in Space Oddity.

505
00:31:07,333 --> 00:31:08,749
Yes, he did.

506
00:31:13,208 --> 00:31:15,582
- (pitch-shifting notes)
- Holy cow!

507
00:31:19,166 --> 00:31:20,707
How do you ever leave this place?

508
00:31:22,125 --> 00:31:24,832
You'd be surprised at
all the distractions that can come up.

509
00:31:24,916 --> 00:31:27,249
You were good out there, you know?

510
00:31:27,333 --> 00:31:28,790
You really know how to work a crowd.

511
00:31:29,083 --> 00:31:30,374
Thanks, man.

512
00:31:30,625 --> 00:31:32,207
You know what? Let's hear
that track of yours again.

513
00:31:32,291 --> 00:31:33,665
You got it with you?

514
00:31:34,750 --> 00:31:36,624
(electronic dance music playing)

515
00:31:43,583 --> 00:31:45,183
- (music stops)
- Okay, here's the thing.

516
00:31:45,541 --> 00:31:48,040
The beginning sounds
like Skrillex's brother made it.

517
00:31:48,375 --> 00:31:49,957
And then right here...

518
00:31:50,041 --> 00:31:51,540
(music resumes)

519
00:31:52,875 --> 00:31:55,665
That sounds like early Juan Atkins
to me, which is good,

520
00:31:55,750 --> 00:31:58,165
but, uh, you're trying to be
too many different people.

521
00:31:58,250 --> 00:31:59,457
I want it to be that way.

522
00:31:59,541 --> 00:32:01,665
I want a lot of switches.
I want a lot of transitions.

523
00:32:01,750 --> 00:32:02,750
Yeah.

524
00:32:02,833 --> 00:32:04,124
Like, big, heavy drops.

525
00:32:04,208 --> 00:32:06,249
- Mmm.
- That's what's crushing it now.

526
00:32:06,333 --> 00:32:09,499
You sound like an asshole.
All that was missing was a hashtag.

527
00:32:10,208 --> 00:32:12,624
"Imitation is suicide."
Emerson said that.

528
00:32:14,958 --> 00:32:16,207
Okay.

529
00:32:16,291 --> 00:32:18,249
Look, you can make people dance,
and that's half the battle.

530
00:32:18,625 --> 00:32:21,665
Any successful artist,
they have this moment

531
00:32:21,750 --> 00:32:26,040
when they stop being an admirer
and they find their signature.

532
00:32:28,833 --> 00:32:30,124
You know a secret?

533
00:32:30,208 --> 00:32:32,915
I never go to sushi
on Mondays because...

534
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,040
Fun fact.

535
00:32:34,125 --> 00:32:35,790
All the fish markets are closed.

536
00:32:35,875 --> 00:32:37,374
You guys want to hear
something interesting?

537
00:32:37,458 --> 00:32:41,207
The best sushi in all of LA
is Teru Sushi in fucking Studio City.

538
00:32:42,458 --> 00:32:44,915
(laughs) Does this girl look like
she eats in the Valley?

539
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:46,832
(all laughing)

540
00:32:47,458 --> 00:32:48,749
Okay, the sushi in the Valley

541
00:32:48,833 --> 00:32:51,040
is the best sushi
in the western hemisphere, kid.

542
00:32:51,416 --> 00:32:53,216
And what are you,
the Valley Board of Tourism?

543
00:32:55,916 --> 00:32:59,207
- Mase, Mase. Chill, chill.
- Excuse me. Relax. Relax.

544
00:32:59,791 --> 00:33:01,624
Have a sense of humour, bro.

545
00:33:02,125 --> 00:33:04,415
Did he just say "bro"?
I got a sense of humour.

546
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:06,457
You want to hear
something fucking hilarious?

547
00:33:06,541 --> 00:33:08,540
You dress like Hillary Clinton, bro.

548
00:33:21,250 --> 00:33:22,250
(James) Hey!

549
00:33:23,083 --> 00:33:24,124
Hey!

550
00:33:24,208 --> 00:33:25,540
Hey!

551
00:33:27,291 --> 00:33:28,999
(Cole stammering) What happened?

552
00:33:29,083 --> 00:33:30,457
What was that about?

553
00:33:30,541 --> 00:33:31,624
Sushi.

554
00:33:31,750 --> 00:33:33,249
Sushi?

555
00:33:37,791 --> 00:33:38,832
(sniffles)

556
00:33:46,791 --> 00:33:48,040
(Squirrel) Pick a place, man.

557
00:33:56,375 --> 00:33:58,332
Why don't we come here more often, man?

558
00:33:59,333 --> 00:34:00,832
I come here all the time.

559
00:34:03,833 --> 00:34:04,999
Really?

560
00:34:05,750 --> 00:34:06,957
Yeah.

561
00:34:08,166 --> 00:34:11,040
You know, try to clear my head.

562
00:34:13,625 --> 00:34:15,290
Sorry about your gig though.

563
00:34:17,625 --> 00:34:19,207
- (Cole) Whatever.
- Yeah.

564
00:34:19,916 --> 00:34:21,207
(both laughing)

565
00:34:45,916 --> 00:34:47,540
(doorbell ringing)

566
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:02,540
Oh, Jesus.

567
00:35:07,375 --> 00:35:08,624
- Hey.
- Hey.

568
00:35:10,875 --> 00:35:11,875
Is James home?

569
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,790
Yeah, he should be.

570
00:35:13,875 --> 00:35:14,999
I'll let you in.

571
00:35:36,541 --> 00:35:38,290
Hey, babe.

572
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,374
(James) I was just taking a little nap.

573
00:35:44,958 --> 00:35:46,624
(Sophie) I know.

574
00:35:51,291 --> 00:35:52,291
(James coughing)

575
00:35:52,541 --> 00:35:54,665
- Hey.
- What are you doing here?

576
00:35:55,583 --> 00:35:56,624
I can't accept this.

577
00:35:57,291 --> 00:35:59,249
Oh, Christ.
Put that back in your pocket.

578
00:35:59,333 --> 00:36:00,999
What, you think I broke up with you?

579
00:36:01,291 --> 00:36:02,999
- No, man.
- Your friends, dude,

580
00:36:03,083 --> 00:36:04,874
they're gorillas,
but me and you, we're cool.

581
00:36:06,250 --> 00:36:07,332
Is that it?

582
00:36:10,916 --> 00:36:11,915
- (electronic music playing)
- What is that?

583
00:36:12,416 --> 00:36:14,016
That one, right there. What's that loop?

584
00:36:14,166 --> 00:36:15,249
That's a handclap.

585
00:36:15,583 --> 00:36:18,383
Yeah, I know it's a handclap, dipshit.
But what is it? Did you make it?

586
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:19,500
It's a sample.

587
00:36:20,541 --> 00:36:23,457
Well, ironically,
it's the only live thing in there.

588
00:36:23,541 --> 00:36:26,290
I mean, amongst all this other
synthetic computer-generated garbage,

589
00:36:26,375 --> 00:36:29,707
that's one honest handclap.

590
00:36:31,041 --> 00:36:33,082
Listen, I get it, man.
I've been there before.

591
00:36:33,958 --> 00:36:35,999
But you're not gonna get anywhere
using the same old sounds

592
00:36:36,083 --> 00:36:37,790
that every other laptop DJ is using.

593
00:36:37,875 --> 00:36:39,624
Yeah. But, I mean, by definition, like,

594
00:36:39,708 --> 00:36:41,624
all electronic music
is computer-generated.

595
00:36:41,708 --> 00:36:43,207
Yeah, but it can be organic.

596
00:36:45,916 --> 00:36:47,957
So that synthetic kick drum...

597
00:36:49,333 --> 00:36:50,707
So that tinny keyboard...

598
00:36:53,166 --> 00:36:54,582
Music.

599
00:36:55,416 --> 00:36:56,957
Sounds have soul.

600
00:36:57,583 --> 00:36:58,665
Build them from scratch.

601
00:36:59,291 --> 00:37:00,457
Find new ones.

602
00:37:00,791 --> 00:37:01,915
Get your head out of that laptop

603
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:05,499
and start listening to what the real
fucking world is trying to tell you.

604
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,040
That's your problem.

605
00:37:07,750 --> 00:37:08,832
You don't listen.

606
00:37:09,458 --> 00:37:11,790
Hey, Jimmy is on the phone
about Venetian Fields.

607
00:37:11,875 --> 00:37:14,082
What days are we travelling
to Vegas, 20th or 21 st?

608
00:37:14,875 --> 00:37:17,355
- (electronic music playing)
- What do you think of that track?

609
00:37:18,875 --> 00:37:20,207
Um, it's fine.

610
00:37:20,291 --> 00:37:21,415
See? Haters.

611
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:22,832
Haters are your target audience.

612
00:37:23,375 --> 00:37:26,124
Oh. Well, lovers know where you sleep.

613
00:37:26,208 --> 00:37:28,207
- Which day?
- 19th.

614
00:37:28,291 --> 00:37:30,374
- I need a blackjack day.
- (Sophie) Thank you.

615
00:37:30,708 --> 00:37:34,624
Hi, Jimmy. Yeah, he says, um, the 19th.

616
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:39,207
Yeah, we're looking forward to it.
I'll make sure he gets there on time.

617
00:37:39,291 --> 00:37:40,291
Thank you.

618
00:37:41,375 --> 00:37:43,582
(James) Well, you sounded
highly professional right now.

619
00:37:43,666 --> 00:37:45,457
Don't patronise me.

620
00:37:47,291 --> 00:37:50,540
I'm gonna take a break. You can
use the space whenever you want.

621
00:37:50,875 --> 00:37:53,249
- You are coming with me.
- (Sophie giggles)

622
00:37:54,333 --> 00:37:55,333
(sighs)

623
00:38:04,166 --> 00:38:06,665
Hi, I'm calling from
Gold Star Realty Solutions.

624
00:38:06,750 --> 00:38:09,332
May I speak with Tanya Romero?

625
00:38:09,416 --> 00:38:10,416
This is she.

626
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:11,540
Hi, Tanya.

627
00:38:11,625 --> 00:38:14,374
I understand that your bank's
given you a notice of foreclosure.

628
00:38:14,458 --> 00:38:16,790
Yesterday. How did you know that?

629
00:38:17,708 --> 00:38:19,915
Well, we work with the banks
to help negotiate...

630
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,290
- (baby fussing)
- Shh, honey.

631
00:38:22,375 --> 00:38:24,082
Sounds like you have
a little monster over there.

632
00:38:24,166 --> 00:38:25,415
That's my son, Richard.

633
00:38:25,916 --> 00:38:27,790
Richard. (Chuckles)

634
00:38:28,375 --> 00:38:31,499
That's actually... That's funny.
That's my dad's name.

635
00:38:31,583 --> 00:38:33,103
Cole. Cole, baby, come check this out.

636
00:38:34,083 --> 00:38:35,163
Why don't you let him work?

637
00:38:35,583 --> 00:38:38,249
Are you really able
to prevent evictions?

638
00:38:38,333 --> 00:38:39,333
Uh, yeah.

639
00:38:39,666 --> 00:38:41,124
Absolutely. Actually, you know what?

640
00:38:41,208 --> 00:38:43,290
Let me transfer you over to my manager

641
00:38:43,375 --> 00:38:45,540
- and he can talk you through everything.
- (Paige) First name?

642
00:38:45,625 --> 00:38:47,265
- What?
- What is the client's first name?

643
00:38:47,333 --> 00:38:48,333
(Cole) Tanya.

644
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,374
Tanya Romero.

645
00:38:51,666 --> 00:38:52,915
Tanya, Paige Laurel.

646
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,640
I hear we're catching you
at a rough time.

647
00:38:55,583 --> 00:38:57,374
Right. Oh, right.

648
00:38:57,458 --> 00:39:00,457
Let me just tell you a little bit
about what we do.

649
00:40:09,708 --> 00:40:11,832
- (electronic dance music playing)
- (crowd cheering)

650
00:40:17,958 --> 00:40:19,874
- I need your voice.
- I don't want to.

651
00:40:19,958 --> 00:40:21,874
- No, I'm not doing it.
- Come here. Help me, come on.

652
00:40:21,958 --> 00:40:23,665
(all talking at once)

653
00:40:23,750 --> 00:40:25,790
- You don't wanna help your buddy?
- No. No!

654
00:40:26,791 --> 00:40:27,915
Number nine.

655
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,082
(in low voice) Number nine.

656
00:40:29,291 --> 00:40:30,582
(both laughing)

657
00:40:32,666 --> 00:40:35,832
♫ Synchronicity is electricity

658
00:40:36,541 --> 00:40:39,874
♫ Synchronicity is electricity

659
00:40:41,958 --> 00:40:43,707
(electronic dance music playing)

660
00:40:46,708 --> 00:40:47,708
(inaudible)

661
00:41:15,750 --> 00:41:16,750
(laughs)

662
00:41:20,083 --> 00:41:21,957
Good. That's good.

663
00:41:24,125 --> 00:41:25,665
- That was it?
- Yeah, that's it.

664
00:41:25,750 --> 00:41:27,040
That's how you make a track.

665
00:41:27,125 --> 00:41:29,415
- That was really, really scary.
- That was it.

666
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:30,665
That's the one.

667
00:41:31,291 --> 00:41:32,707
He said, "Meet me at the fountain."

668
00:41:32,791 --> 00:41:35,082
I was like, "'Fountain'? We're in Rome.
There's fountains everywhere.

669
00:41:35,166 --> 00:41:36,915
"Which fountain?"

670
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,540
- (speaking Spanish)
- (♫ latin American music)

671
00:41:39,625 --> 00:41:41,540
Hey, let's wait till Clarissa's.

672
00:41:41,833 --> 00:41:44,415
Clarissa. Who's Clarissa?

673
00:41:45,541 --> 00:41:48,207
Um, you met her, like,
three times. She, um...

674
00:41:48,291 --> 00:41:50,415
- She just graduated from Stanford.
- (mobile vibrating)

675
00:41:50,500 --> 00:41:52,540
(James) Oh, the Stanford party. Right.

676
00:41:53,958 --> 00:41:55,078
Come on, they're my friends.

677
00:41:56,291 --> 00:41:57,611
Well, I can be your friend, baby.

678
00:42:02,375 --> 00:42:04,624
Why don't you take Cole?
Cole, you should go.

679
00:42:06,833 --> 00:42:09,040
Come on, man. It's Friday night.

680
00:42:09,125 --> 00:42:10,665
Like, what else are you gonna do?

681
00:42:10,750 --> 00:42:12,999
I'm gonna watch C-Span
until I lose faith in humanity.

682
00:42:13,083 --> 00:42:14,582
But you guys should go.

683
00:42:14,666 --> 00:42:17,332
You can talk about your
millennial angst. Too much validation.

684
00:42:20,458 --> 00:42:22,124
(man) The irony is
if you're gonna be a lawyer,

685
00:42:22,208 --> 00:42:24,624
you're basically handing in essays
for the rest of your life.

686
00:42:24,708 --> 00:42:26,165
Yeah, but at least
now I'm getting paid for it.

687
00:42:26,250 --> 00:42:27,540
Cheers to that.

688
00:42:29,541 --> 00:42:30,541
What do you do?

689
00:42:31,583 --> 00:42:32,832
Uh, I'm an assistant.

690
00:42:32,916 --> 00:42:34,082
Oh, yeah? Where at?

691
00:42:34,166 --> 00:42:36,040
A personal assistant, actually.

692
00:42:36,125 --> 00:42:38,165
- For a musician.
- Oh, for who?

693
00:42:38,250 --> 00:42:39,499
I love music.

694
00:42:39,583 --> 00:42:41,624
James Reed? He's a DJ.

695
00:42:44,041 --> 00:42:46,040
Yeah, I don't know him.

696
00:42:46,541 --> 00:42:48,665
- I'm gonna get a drink.
- I'll come with you.

697
00:42:49,125 --> 00:42:50,249
Excuse me.

698
00:42:53,625 --> 00:42:56,790
I think they spent, like,
$200 on cheese.

699
00:42:57,041 --> 00:42:59,249
Yeah, and half the people here
don't eat dairy.

700
00:43:01,166 --> 00:43:02,665
I'm gonna find the bathroom.

701
00:43:02,750 --> 00:43:04,540
You sure you're okay?

702
00:43:04,625 --> 00:43:06,415
Yeah, I'm fine.

703
00:43:09,541 --> 00:43:11,707
(man) Hey,
that Sophie girl is pretty cute.

704
00:43:11,791 --> 00:43:14,457
- Is she our year?
- For like a minute. She failed out.

705
00:43:15,041 --> 00:43:16,082
What do you mean?

706
00:43:16,166 --> 00:43:18,082
Every guy in our dorm saw her tits.

707
00:43:18,166 --> 00:43:20,624
I never went there personally.
Wish I had.

708
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:22,290
The line's too long.

709
00:43:22,375 --> 00:43:24,499
- Here, let's go over here.
- Why?

710
00:43:24,583 --> 00:43:27,023
(man 2) And she's, like,
totally fucking the DJ she works for.

711
00:43:27,125 --> 00:43:28,707
He's, like, 40 and pays the bills.

712
00:43:28,791 --> 00:43:31,124
(man 1 ) Hey, I'd help her
buy groceries for a week or two.

713
00:43:31,250 --> 00:43:32,332
(both laughing)

714
00:43:34,583 --> 00:43:36,082
- Don't.
- Hmm?

715
00:43:41,750 --> 00:43:45,124
Hey, when you guys jerk each other off,
do you take turns?

716
00:43:46,041 --> 00:43:49,207
Or is it more of like
a simultaneous kind of deal?

717
00:43:52,791 --> 00:43:53,874
- (Sophie) Cole! Stop!
- (glass shattering)

718
00:43:54,208 --> 00:43:55,332
Hey!

719
00:44:02,541 --> 00:44:04,457
You really didn't have to do that.

720
00:44:04,541 --> 00:44:06,040
(Cole) Fuck those guys.

721
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,832
They wouldn't last two seconds
in the real world.

722
00:44:10,875 --> 00:44:13,707
(Sophie) Those guys will
end up running the real world.

723
00:44:14,375 --> 00:44:15,665
Yeah, I know.

724
00:44:16,500 --> 00:44:19,790
Just so you know, I didn't fail out.

725
00:44:20,708 --> 00:44:22,207
I just needed to take some time off.

726
00:44:23,708 --> 00:44:27,665
Now all my friends are graduating
and I have nothing to show for myself.

727
00:44:29,541 --> 00:44:31,665
Why don't you just go back to school?

728
00:44:33,250 --> 00:44:35,249
I can't afford it.

729
00:44:37,208 --> 00:44:39,749
There are a tonne of schools
that are cheaper than Stanford.

730
00:44:42,416 --> 00:44:43,707
Yeah, maybe.

731
00:44:50,125 --> 00:44:52,957
James thinks you're really talented.

732
00:44:53,958 --> 00:44:55,249
Yeah?

733
00:44:55,666 --> 00:44:57,040
Yeah.

734
00:44:57,750 --> 00:44:59,832
- (laughs)
- He said that?

735
00:45:00,583 --> 00:45:04,790
He said you have
"an acute sense of assemblage".

736
00:45:09,208 --> 00:45:10,374
Yes!

737
00:45:15,208 --> 00:45:16,790
What the fuck does that mean?

738
00:45:16,875 --> 00:45:17,957
Is it French?

739
00:45:18,041 --> 00:45:19,582
(French accent) Assemblage.

740
00:45:19,750 --> 00:45:20,874
(French accent) Assemblage.

741
00:45:21,708 --> 00:45:23,308
- Do you really know what it means?
- No.

742
00:45:23,416 --> 00:45:25,749
I don't really, either,
but it's a good thing, I think.

743
00:45:25,833 --> 00:45:26,874
I think so, too.

744
00:45:46,541 --> 00:45:48,665
(Ollie) We have got uppers,
downers, screamers, laughers,

745
00:45:48,750 --> 00:45:51,624
MDMA and some fucking Special K.

746
00:45:51,708 --> 00:45:54,707
Even got some mints for the kids.

747
00:45:54,791 --> 00:45:56,124
I fucking love music festivals.

748
00:45:56,208 --> 00:46:00,165
Yeah, every hit of ecstasy is, like,
five years of jail sentence at least.

749
00:46:00,250 --> 00:46:02,749
All right, rave rule number one. Okay?

750
00:46:02,833 --> 00:46:05,332
If anybody gets lost,
we have the buddy fucking system.

751
00:46:05,416 --> 00:46:07,290
We meet back at the car, right?

752
00:46:07,375 --> 00:46:09,055
I hate being daddy here,
but I gotta do it.

753
00:46:09,083 --> 00:46:11,540
That's the rule.

754
00:46:17,166 --> 00:46:18,790
(electronic dance music playing)

755
00:46:36,833 --> 00:46:38,124
(beeping)

756
00:46:39,541 --> 00:46:41,540
It's just a phone.

757
00:47:18,083 --> 00:47:19,290
(Sophie on voicemail) Hey, are you here?

758
00:47:19,375 --> 00:47:21,290
I'm at the Ferris wheel. Come find me.

759
00:47:22,291 --> 00:47:24,207
I love it here.

760
00:47:28,958 --> 00:47:30,082
I gotta go.

761
00:47:31,541 --> 00:47:33,374
Hey, guys, I'll be right back.

762
00:47:33,458 --> 00:47:35,290
- I'll be right back.
- Where the fuck are you going, man?

763
00:47:35,708 --> 00:47:36,948
Fuck, man! Where are you going?

764
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:46,915
James got drunk and ditched me.

765
00:47:50,333 --> 00:47:52,749
- Are you rolling?
- Me? Never.

766
00:47:54,708 --> 00:47:56,624
Stick out your tongue.

767
00:49:21,750 --> 00:49:23,290
Where are you, man? We're at the spot.

768
00:49:23,375 --> 00:49:24,749
Just give him five minutes.

769
00:51:20,708 --> 00:51:23,374
- Hi.
- Hi.

770
00:51:26,541 --> 00:51:27,999
Should we get room service?

771
00:51:32,958 --> 00:51:34,749
- I want pancakes.
- Hmm.

772
00:51:44,375 --> 00:51:46,207
I want a cheeseburger.

773
00:51:48,750 --> 00:51:50,540
- Cheeseburger?
- With bacon.

774
00:51:52,125 --> 00:51:53,999
And fries.

775
00:51:54,083 --> 00:51:55,457
And a side of avocado.

776
00:51:57,791 --> 00:51:59,082
(chuckling)

777
00:52:01,250 --> 00:52:02,540
Mmm.

778
00:52:08,041 --> 00:52:09,749
(Sophie chuckling)

779
00:52:09,833 --> 00:52:11,290
- So good.
- So good.

780
00:52:11,375 --> 00:52:12,624
How is yours?

781
00:52:12,708 --> 00:52:14,207
Fucking unbelievable.

782
00:52:14,291 --> 00:52:15,374
Can I try?

783
00:52:15,458 --> 00:52:16,540
Yes.

784
00:52:17,875 --> 00:52:19,582
Oh, my God. I'm stuffing my face.

785
00:52:19,666 --> 00:52:22,332
I was so hungry. So good.

786
00:52:23,208 --> 00:52:24,749
Mmm.

787
00:52:24,833 --> 00:52:26,707
(chuckling) You have no idea.

788
00:52:29,708 --> 00:52:31,499
(Mason) Can't believe you fucking
did that to your friends, right?

789
00:52:31,583 --> 00:52:34,499
I mean, she'd better have been
an eight and a half, like, on a bad day.

790
00:52:34,583 --> 00:52:35,823
What are you fucking smiling...

791
00:52:35,875 --> 00:52:37,415
You ditch your friends,
and you're smiling.

792
00:52:37,500 --> 00:52:39,374
It's not fucking funny.
If I didn't love you,

793
00:52:39,625 --> 00:52:40,832
or if you didn't have
such a pretty smile,

794
00:52:40,916 --> 00:52:43,082
I swear to God,
I'd fucking take you down.

795
00:52:43,166 --> 00:52:44,999
(laughing)

796
00:52:47,750 --> 00:52:49,374
(overlapping chatter)

797
00:52:59,583 --> 00:53:01,082
(inaudible)

798
00:53:17,666 --> 00:53:20,332
(on voicemail) Hey, it's Sophie,
leave a message.

799
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,249
Gold Star Realty Solutions.

800
00:53:28,333 --> 00:53:31,290
Hi, uh, this is Tanya Romero.

801
00:53:31,375 --> 00:53:32,999
Is this Cole?

802
00:53:33,083 --> 00:53:34,499
Yeah. Hi, Tanya.

803
00:53:34,583 --> 00:53:36,624
- Uh, can you do something for me?
- (phone chimes)

804
00:53:37,916 --> 00:53:39,249
Hello? Cole?

805
00:53:40,791 --> 00:53:42,332
Hello?

806
00:53:46,125 --> 00:53:47,207
You.

807
00:53:48,958 --> 00:53:50,457
What the fuck, man?

808
00:53:52,541 --> 00:53:53,957
You didn't call me at the festival.

809
00:53:54,791 --> 00:53:57,665
I met up
with these Ukrainian acrobats...

810
00:53:57,750 --> 00:54:00,790
Oh... Cell phone reception was shitty.

811
00:54:01,458 --> 00:54:03,957
Come on. The fight's already started.

812
00:54:04,291 --> 00:54:07,124
Oh, uh, can I get you
something to drink?

813
00:54:07,208 --> 00:54:08,207
Uh, yeah, man, whatever you're having.

814
00:54:08,500 --> 00:54:11,374
Well, I'm having Pellegrino
'cause I'm... laying off.

815
00:54:13,708 --> 00:54:15,082
- Sure, the same thing.
- Same thing?

816
00:54:15,166 --> 00:54:16,166
Yeah, Pellegrino.

817
00:54:16,333 --> 00:54:18,290
All right. Yay!

818
00:54:26,041 --> 00:54:27,124
I'm not really
into sports

819
00:54:27,208 --> 00:54:28,957
but there's something about grown men
beating the shit out of each other

820
00:54:29,041 --> 00:54:31,457
while their friends watch
that really intrigues me.

821
00:54:37,791 --> 00:54:40,832
I'm gonna go get an energy drink.
Anybody want anything?

822
00:54:40,916 --> 00:54:42,415
No, I'm good, man, thank you.

823
00:54:51,541 --> 00:54:53,290
I tried to call you.

824
00:54:57,750 --> 00:54:59,624
Look, it was inevitable
it was gonna happen

825
00:54:59,708 --> 00:55:02,207
and it happened, so let's just move on.

826
00:55:02,541 --> 00:55:03,665
What?

827
00:55:07,541 --> 00:55:08,957
Is that what you really want?

828
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:15,665
(James) Anyway... I may or may not
have gotten a little sentimental.

829
00:55:16,750 --> 00:55:18,457
Here you go.

830
00:55:27,875 --> 00:55:30,374
It's actually a self-serving gift.

831
00:55:30,458 --> 00:55:32,540
I was asked to play
the Pioneer DJ Summerfest,

832
00:55:32,625 --> 00:55:33,707
they said I could bring an opener.

833
00:55:33,791 --> 00:55:34,874
Are you kidding me?

834
00:55:35,333 --> 00:55:37,707
But then I imagined you
up there with your janky rig

835
00:55:37,791 --> 00:55:42,707
in front of all those gyrating tweens
and it just didn't sit right.

836
00:55:44,041 --> 00:55:45,999
Better get that track ready.

837
00:55:50,333 --> 00:55:51,915
(electronic dance music playing)

838
00:56:18,875 --> 00:56:21,790
This, uh, I...
I found on my door yesterday.

839
00:56:22,083 --> 00:56:23,874
Uh-oh. (Exhales sharply)

840
00:56:24,666 --> 00:56:25,666
God!

841
00:56:26,083 --> 00:56:27,540
Just awful. Mmm.

842
00:56:28,041 --> 00:56:29,374
I can't even imagine.

843
00:56:30,875 --> 00:56:32,290
(sighs)

844
00:56:32,458 --> 00:56:35,124
So, what's the next move?

845
00:56:35,208 --> 00:56:39,665
Mrs Romero, I'm sure you must know
the housing market right now,

846
00:56:40,208 --> 00:56:41,915
it's just brutal.

847
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,249
Now, I brought a record
of our correspondence with your bank

848
00:56:44,375 --> 00:56:46,915
and if you look at this,
you can see that we pushed.

849
00:56:47,041 --> 00:56:50,499
It's just... These guys, they just,
they do not wanna work with us.

850
00:56:52,041 --> 00:56:53,457
Where does that leave me?

851
00:56:53,541 --> 00:56:56,374
Yeah, Paige, there's gotta be
something we could do.

852
00:56:57,666 --> 00:57:00,082
Okay. Um... (clears throat)

853
00:57:00,625 --> 00:57:04,207
Look, there is, uh... (laughs)
There's one thing, I guess.

854
00:57:04,291 --> 00:57:06,499
(stammers) It's not
something that we usually do.

855
00:57:06,583 --> 00:57:10,624
But if you were to sign
the deed of your house over to us,

856
00:57:11,166 --> 00:57:16,165
I could offer you a $20,000 rebate
right here on the spot.

857
00:57:16,250 --> 00:57:18,582
You're offering to
buy my house for $20,000

858
00:57:18,666 --> 00:57:20,290
but it's worth $300,000.

859
00:57:20,375 --> 00:57:22,624
Yeah, but that's just a number, right?

860
00:57:22,708 --> 00:57:23,999
I mean, it really doesn't mean anything.

861
00:57:24,083 --> 00:57:27,707
You see, that number doesn't matter
because you're in foreclosure.

862
00:57:27,791 --> 00:57:33,040
So you could lose your house,
get nothing, or sign it over to us.

863
00:57:33,125 --> 00:57:35,374
I'll rent it back to you
and I'll do it at a lower rate.

864
00:57:40,750 --> 00:57:41,999
What was that?

865
00:57:42,083 --> 00:57:45,374
Just did more for that woman
than any bank ever could.

866
00:57:45,458 --> 00:57:46,957
You just stole her fucking house.

867
00:57:47,041 --> 00:57:49,332
No, no, no. We just made
real fucking money in there.

868
00:57:49,416 --> 00:57:52,249
You got that? Real fucking money.
Did you see that chandelier?

869
00:57:52,333 --> 00:57:55,790
I will sell this place
for 500-600 grand, easy.

870
00:57:55,875 --> 00:57:57,457
Sell it?

871
00:57:57,541 --> 00:58:00,707
You just said
you were gonna rent it back to her.

872
00:58:00,791 --> 00:58:01,999
(laughing) Jesus, get out of here.

873
00:58:02,083 --> 00:58:03,083
You got to relax, kid.

874
00:58:03,166 --> 00:58:05,206
I'm not talking about
doing it overnight, all right?

875
00:58:05,583 --> 00:58:06,874
- Fuck, man!
- Hey, hey, hey!

876
00:58:07,208 --> 00:58:08,208
Listen.

877
00:58:08,291 --> 00:58:10,999
Everybody is responsible for themselves.
You got that?

878
00:58:11,208 --> 00:58:12,415
You just walked in that house,

879
00:58:12,500 --> 00:58:14,790
you earned yourself a $15,000 bonus.

880
00:58:14,875 --> 00:58:17,124
Now, do you want that money
or are you too upset?

881
00:58:25,666 --> 00:58:26,749
(engine starting)

882
00:58:42,125 --> 00:58:44,165
(playing keyboard)

883
00:59:05,625 --> 00:59:08,207
(James) You know why
the dining experience is subpar in LA?

884
00:59:08,791 --> 00:59:11,790
'Cause the restaurant staff
is biding their time

885
00:59:11,875 --> 00:59:14,415
until they land a sitcom.

886
00:59:14,500 --> 00:59:18,040
They can remember their lines but
they can't remember my fucking order.

887
00:59:18,125 --> 00:59:19,915
Well, it got a good review online.

888
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:24,165
Oh, yes. The high-minded people
of the internet have spoken.

889
00:59:24,250 --> 00:59:26,570
The high-minded people of the internet
speak highly of you.

890
00:59:26,958 --> 00:59:28,707
Oh, yeah.

891
00:59:28,791 --> 00:59:30,151
That shows you how much they know.

892
00:59:32,083 --> 00:59:33,624
- Hey.
- Hey.

893
00:59:34,375 --> 00:59:38,207
Another drink.
I can't talk when you're like this.

894
00:59:38,291 --> 00:59:39,790
(James) Oh, like what?

895
00:59:43,041 --> 00:59:44,041
Oh.

896
00:59:44,583 --> 00:59:45,874
Happy birthday.

897
00:59:47,916 --> 00:59:49,290
I think I'm gonna go.

898
00:59:49,375 --> 00:59:51,040
Wait, wait, wait, wait. Come on.

899
00:59:52,750 --> 00:59:55,040
Wanna have some cake?
It's my birthday.

900
00:59:55,125 --> 00:59:56,374
Happy birthday, man.

901
00:59:56,458 --> 00:59:58,082
Come here, come here.

902
01:00:01,083 --> 01:00:02,874
Take that. Take it. Take it.

903
01:00:03,958 --> 01:00:05,332
Thanks.

904
01:00:05,416 --> 01:00:08,999
Soph, you want a piece
with a blueberry on it?

905
01:00:15,250 --> 01:00:17,249
Mmm. Oh, that's good.

906
01:00:17,791 --> 01:00:19,374
Cole?

907
01:00:19,458 --> 01:00:21,290
- So good, baby.
- (muffled) It's really good.

908
01:00:25,583 --> 01:00:27,874
You know I hate my birthday.

909
01:00:28,083 --> 01:00:30,124
I got it. (Chuckles)

910
01:00:30,208 --> 01:00:31,415
Now I hate it, too.

911
01:00:33,250 --> 01:00:34,374
Soph.

912
01:00:35,541 --> 01:00:37,165
All right, you're gonna miss out.

913
01:00:37,625 --> 01:00:39,915
Cole and I are gonna
eat this entire thing.

914
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:43,165
(Sophie) Do what you want.
You always do.

915
01:00:43,250 --> 01:00:44,540
Yes!

916
01:00:45,416 --> 01:00:46,624
It's a good philosophy.

917
01:00:46,708 --> 01:00:49,915
If everybody did what they wanted,
the world would be a happier place.

918
01:00:50,041 --> 01:00:52,165
You're not happy. You're drunk.

919
01:00:52,250 --> 01:00:53,999
- I'm just gonna go.
- No, no, no, stay.

920
01:00:54,083 --> 01:00:56,207
Apparently this is my birthday party
and we're gonna celebrate.

921
01:00:56,291 --> 01:00:57,731
Sophie, come on, let's have a drink.

922
01:00:58,083 --> 01:00:59,374
Sophie.

923
01:00:59,916 --> 01:01:01,124
Get your ass down here!

924
01:01:05,500 --> 01:01:07,499
Is this the part
where I go redeem myself?

925
01:01:13,708 --> 01:01:15,290
Come on.

926
01:01:15,375 --> 01:01:17,207
Let's get out of here.

927
01:01:17,333 --> 01:01:19,374
(hip-hop music playing)

928
01:01:28,416 --> 01:01:29,499
Oh, yeah!

929
01:01:32,916 --> 01:01:34,332
(exhales deeply)

930
01:01:34,416 --> 01:01:35,707
Summerfest!

931
01:01:35,791 --> 01:01:36,999
Cheers.

932
01:01:43,458 --> 01:01:45,499
It's gonna be a blast, man.
You think you're ready?

933
01:01:45,750 --> 01:01:47,582
- Mmm.
- This could be your big launch, man.

934
01:01:47,666 --> 01:01:50,249
I know a lot of young DJs
got their start at Summerfest.

935
01:01:50,333 --> 01:01:52,957
Are you listening to me?
I feel like you're not listening to me.

936
01:01:53,041 --> 01:01:54,374
I gotta piss.

937
01:01:54,458 --> 01:01:55,665
I'm not feeling so hot.

938
01:01:55,750 --> 01:01:57,790
Jesus! You broke the seal too early.

939
01:02:02,625 --> 01:02:06,415
You are so talented.

940
01:02:06,541 --> 01:02:08,249
(vomiting)

941
01:02:10,583 --> 01:02:12,124
(phone chimes, vibrates)

942
01:02:23,250 --> 01:02:24,999
(coughing)

943
01:02:26,166 --> 01:02:27,374
(spitting)

944
01:02:27,458 --> 01:02:29,124
(James) Wow.

945
01:02:29,208 --> 01:02:30,707
You were right.

946
01:02:30,791 --> 01:02:32,332
You really shouldn't drink whisky.

947
01:02:33,500 --> 01:02:36,457
- (phone chimes, vibrates)
- What's that? Is that your phone?

948
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:39,290
Hey!
Answer your fucking phone, Cole!

949
01:02:39,541 --> 01:02:41,415
Who is that?

950
01:02:41,500 --> 01:02:42,582
What the fuck is your problem?

951
01:02:42,708 --> 01:02:45,290
Who the fuck is calling you
at 1:00 a.m.?

952
01:02:48,166 --> 01:02:49,749
She probably wants to talk about you.

953
01:02:50,833 --> 01:02:53,749
You ungrateful little shit.
Did you fuck her?

954
01:02:54,250 --> 01:02:55,290
What?

955
01:02:55,916 --> 01:02:58,415
- (groans) Fuck.
- Did you fuck her?

956
01:03:01,208 --> 01:03:02,832
(groans)

957
01:03:04,958 --> 01:03:06,374
Ow!

958
01:03:06,666 --> 01:03:08,165
What the fuck was that?

959
01:03:08,250 --> 01:03:10,040
That's four years of MMA,
emphasis on Muay Thai.

960
01:03:10,125 --> 01:03:11,832
(groaning)

961
01:03:11,916 --> 01:03:13,332
This is your thing, right?
I mean, you like to fight.

962
01:03:13,416 --> 01:03:14,416
Come on, get up.

963
01:03:14,500 --> 01:03:16,082
You don't give a shit about her, man.

964
01:03:16,166 --> 01:03:17,832
You think 'cause you went off
to Vegas and you fucked her,

965
01:03:17,916 --> 01:03:18,915
you know something I don't?

966
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:20,415
She loves you, you loser.

967
01:03:20,500 --> 01:03:23,540
Oh, I'm a loser, says the guy with
the drug dealer friends and no car.

968
01:03:23,666 --> 01:03:25,374
You're all talk, man.

969
01:03:25,458 --> 01:03:26,999
(sniffing)

970
01:03:27,083 --> 01:03:29,249
You think you're some musical genius.

971
01:03:30,375 --> 01:03:32,457
Maybe you used to be good.

972
01:03:34,166 --> 01:03:35,790
Now you're just a drunk sell-out.

973
01:03:36,458 --> 01:03:38,832
Collecting the cheque.

974
01:03:44,666 --> 01:03:47,665
You listen to me,
you weaselly little cunt.

975
01:03:47,750 --> 01:03:51,249
You don't know a damn thing about me,
the things I walk around with.

976
01:03:51,333 --> 01:03:53,457
What are you, 23 years old?

977
01:03:54,291 --> 01:03:55,874
You haven't even been alive long enough

978
01:03:55,958 --> 01:03:58,582
to understand the meaning
of the world "irreparable".

979
01:04:01,083 --> 01:04:02,323
But at some point in your life,

980
01:04:02,375 --> 01:04:05,540
there are gonna be things
that finish you.

981
01:04:08,375 --> 01:04:11,249
There won't be a damn thing
you can do about it.

982
01:04:27,375 --> 01:04:28,665
Why did you shave it?

983
01:04:29,208 --> 01:04:30,915
Good day, gentlemen.

984
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:32,000
Why did you do that, man?

985
01:04:32,083 --> 01:04:34,540
I was just getting used to fucking
hanging out with Burt Reynolds.

986
01:04:34,625 --> 01:04:36,145
You look like you're 10 years old now.

987
01:04:38,791 --> 01:04:39,791
What happened to you?

988
01:04:42,291 --> 01:04:43,331
Don't wanna talk about it.

989
01:04:44,083 --> 01:04:46,499
(Mason) Fucking depressing in here.
Let's get some sushi.

990
01:04:54,333 --> 01:04:56,665
After we eat, I got something
special to show you guys.

991
01:04:59,958 --> 01:05:01,249
I'm gonna join him.

992
01:05:05,375 --> 01:05:07,832
Sorry about Summerfest, man.
You would have killed it.

993
01:05:12,208 --> 01:05:16,415
I've been applying for jobs
at a few places.

994
01:05:17,416 --> 01:05:18,499
Entry-level positions.

995
01:05:21,916 --> 01:05:23,124
Wait, are you recording this?

996
01:05:25,041 --> 01:05:27,374
Why? You don't wanna
keep working with the group?

997
01:05:28,541 --> 01:05:31,249
I don't know. Do you?

998
01:05:32,625 --> 01:05:34,865
Don't you feel like there's
a lot more we could be doing?

999
01:05:35,833 --> 01:05:37,624
- Like more quality stuff?
- Yeah.

1000
01:05:37,708 --> 01:05:38,915
Dude, this is fucking temporary.

1001
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:40,707
You think we signed up
for a lifetime in real estate?

1002
01:05:41,041 --> 01:05:42,624
And it's not temporary.

1003
01:05:44,125 --> 01:05:45,832
We've always been those guys.

1004
01:05:46,291 --> 01:05:47,915
I mean, Cole,

1005
01:05:48,500 --> 01:05:50,874
are we ever gonna be better than this?

1006
01:05:56,583 --> 01:05:58,374
I thought we said Hollywood Hills,
not Granada Hills.

1007
01:05:58,458 --> 01:05:59,499
(Mason) It's a stepping stone

1008
01:05:59,583 --> 01:06:04,082
and it gets us all out of our
unsatisfactory respective situations.

1009
01:06:04,166 --> 01:06:05,790
Cole, come here. Check this shit out.

1010
01:06:05,875 --> 01:06:09,207
This right here is your studio.

1011
01:06:10,375 --> 01:06:12,040
Soundproof the walls.

1012
01:06:13,375 --> 01:06:15,582
What do you give to a man
who has everything?

1013
01:06:19,500 --> 01:06:20,915
Just more of that man.

1014
01:06:23,291 --> 01:06:24,790
And this...

1015
01:06:25,791 --> 01:06:27,207
This is me.

1016
01:06:27,291 --> 01:06:28,999
Of course.

1017
01:06:29,208 --> 01:06:31,957
You'll all be very happy to know
there's a central AC unit.

1018
01:06:34,500 --> 01:06:35,582
Huh?

1019
01:06:37,333 --> 01:06:39,040
What if somebody wants to move out?

1020
01:06:39,125 --> 01:06:40,125
They fucking move out.

1021
01:06:40,666 --> 01:06:42,186
We'll fill it in with some Craigslist.

1022
01:06:42,916 --> 01:06:43,916
How much?

1023
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:46,207
- 750.
- You got the biggest room, I noticed.

1024
01:06:46,291 --> 01:06:47,731
Yeah. Well, that's the finder's fee.

1025
01:06:47,791 --> 01:06:49,582
- You pay nine, we pay seven.
- Great!

1026
01:06:49,750 --> 01:06:50,999
Okay. (Laughing)

1027
01:06:52,166 --> 01:06:53,166
Who is this for?

1028
01:06:54,166 --> 01:06:55,165
- Huh?
- You already rented it?

1029
01:06:55,250 --> 01:06:56,770
- Here you go.
- (Ollie) Are you crazy?

1030
01:06:56,875 --> 01:06:58,540
Oh, dude. I forgot the best part.

1031
01:07:02,541 --> 01:07:04,374
What are you doing?

1032
01:07:04,500 --> 01:07:05,707
Welcome to the dream, bitches.

1033
01:07:05,833 --> 01:07:06,833
What?

1034
01:07:14,458 --> 01:07:15,957
Get in! The water's warm.

1035
01:07:18,875 --> 01:07:20,165
Do a back flip, Squirrel.

1036
01:07:20,250 --> 01:07:21,832
Get in!

1037
01:07:23,083 --> 01:07:24,290
Yeah!

1038
01:07:25,916 --> 01:07:27,957
(electronic dance music playing)

1039
01:07:46,375 --> 01:07:47,790
(inaudible)

1040
01:08:25,041 --> 01:08:26,415
(laughing)

1041
01:08:26,541 --> 01:08:29,040
♫ I ain't got no crystal ball

1042
01:08:29,125 --> 01:08:35,249
♫ If I had a million dollars
but I'd, I'd spend it all

1043
01:08:35,333 --> 01:08:37,999
We fucking made it. We made it.

1044
01:08:38,083 --> 01:08:39,624
(all laughing)

1045
01:09:09,708 --> 01:09:10,832
Oh, fuck.

1046
01:09:18,791 --> 01:09:20,040
(Mason) Oh, man.

1047
01:09:22,041 --> 01:09:23,207
(exhales)

1048
01:09:23,291 --> 01:09:25,040
Can you stop smacking on that?

1049
01:09:26,583 --> 01:09:29,665
(groans) Dude, I'm fucking dying here.
I'm literally dying.

1050
01:09:30,416 --> 01:09:34,040
Hey, what was the name of
the blonde chick that was playing, uh,

1051
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:36,624
chicken fights?

1052
01:09:36,708 --> 01:09:38,332
I think I banged her.

1053
01:09:39,041 --> 01:09:41,540
This house is gonna
get us arrested, man.

1054
01:09:41,625 --> 01:09:43,832
Have you guys seen
what happened in that bathroom?

1055
01:09:43,916 --> 01:09:45,374
It's fucking... (whistles)

1056
01:09:45,500 --> 01:09:46,540
Yo, Squirrel.

1057
01:09:46,625 --> 01:09:48,665
What was the name of that
fucking blonde chick that I was, like...

1058
01:09:48,750 --> 01:09:50,332
Yo, this guy was
a fucking legend last night.

1059
01:09:50,416 --> 01:09:52,124
Squirrelly bird, I salute you.

1060
01:09:52,208 --> 01:09:54,915
Squirrel. Hey, who was that
blonde bitch yesterday?

1061
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:56,832
Remember her?

1062
01:09:56,916 --> 01:09:57,916
Hey, wake up.

1063
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:00,582
Yo, Squirrel.

1064
01:10:00,875 --> 01:10:02,249
Oh, fuck!

1065
01:10:02,375 --> 01:10:03,375
Squirrel!

1066
01:10:03,458 --> 01:10:06,082
Yo, Cole. He's fucking grey, dude.

1067
01:10:06,166 --> 01:10:07,915
- What?
- He's cold, man. His fucking lips.

1068
01:10:10,125 --> 01:10:11,125
Squirrel, wake up!

1069
01:10:11,791 --> 01:10:12,791
Squirrel.

1070
01:10:12,875 --> 01:10:14,035
No, he's not breathing, guys!

1071
01:10:14,250 --> 01:10:15,540
- What's the address?
- He's not fucking breathing!

1072
01:10:15,625 --> 01:10:18,207
- I don't know.
- You don't know the fucking... Fuck.

1073
01:10:18,291 --> 01:10:20,832
He's not fucking breathing, man!
Squirrel, wake up, man!

1074
01:10:20,916 --> 01:10:23,040
Get him up! Get him up! Get him up!

1075
01:10:23,125 --> 01:10:24,790
Just get him up.

1076
01:10:24,875 --> 01:10:28,040
- Our friend, he's passed out. He's grey!
- What'd you give him last night?

1077
01:10:28,125 --> 01:10:29,540
What'd he take?

1078
01:10:42,750 --> 01:10:44,790
(man reciting, indistinct)

1079
01:10:52,500 --> 01:10:54,499
(continues reciting in Hebrew)

1080
01:11:33,916 --> 01:11:35,457
(Cole) I'm never going
back to that house.

1081
01:11:35,541 --> 01:11:36,582
(phone vibrating)

1082
01:11:40,750 --> 01:11:42,165
Paige sends his condolences.

1083
01:11:43,875 --> 01:11:47,290
Wow, that's real thoughtful of him.
A condolence text.

1084
01:11:49,750 --> 01:11:51,207
If you think I'm going back
to work for that guy,

1085
01:11:51,291 --> 01:11:52,499
you're out of your mind.

1086
01:11:52,666 --> 01:11:54,165
Oh, that's great.

1087
01:11:54,250 --> 01:11:56,624
Let's throw away
the one good job that we have.

1088
01:11:56,708 --> 01:11:58,332
We're ruining lives.

1089
01:12:00,916 --> 01:12:02,040
Do you realise that?

1090
01:12:03,875 --> 01:12:05,582
(Mason) Hey, listen. Fuck Paige.

1091
01:12:05,666 --> 01:12:06,915
We're not going back
to work for him, okay?

1092
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:08,457
Because we don't need him.
We got our own thing.

1093
01:12:08,583 --> 01:12:09,583
What thing?

1094
01:12:09,666 --> 01:12:11,374
We got Thursdays, we got the club.

1095
01:12:11,458 --> 01:12:12,624
You're gonna book a sitcom, man.

1096
01:12:12,708 --> 01:12:15,457
I know you are, and you're gonna
bring celebs to the club.

1097
01:12:15,541 --> 01:12:17,332
And Cole is gonna be headlining.

1098
01:12:17,416 --> 01:12:19,040
We're gonna tear the sides
from this shit right up.

1099
01:12:19,125 --> 01:12:21,040
None of that is real, dude.

1100
01:12:21,416 --> 01:12:23,290
It is not gonna happen.

1101
01:12:24,125 --> 01:12:26,040
Man, I'm not gonna be an actor.

1102
01:12:26,125 --> 01:12:27,415
We're not gonna be millionaires.

1103
01:12:27,500 --> 01:12:30,124
Stuff just doesn't...
It doesn't work like that.

1104
01:12:32,083 --> 01:12:35,040
Look, I look around me, man.

1105
01:12:35,125 --> 01:12:36,707
What else am I supposed to do?

1106
01:12:37,333 --> 01:12:38,624
(sniffling)

1107
01:12:38,708 --> 01:12:41,749
Look, I'm good at this.
You know, I can do this.

1108
01:12:43,916 --> 01:12:46,290
I don't wanna be a loser
the rest of my life.

1109
01:12:48,500 --> 01:12:49,624
And you guys...

1110
01:12:49,708 --> 01:12:53,374
You guys can hate me if you want to
but I'm not quitting.

1111
01:12:55,666 --> 01:12:56,957
(Mason) Good.

1112
01:12:57,750 --> 01:13:00,249
That makes perfect sense,
because you are a fucking loser.

1113
01:13:00,708 --> 01:13:04,249
You're a conniving, half-blood,
disloyal little fucking loser.

1114
01:13:04,333 --> 01:13:05,333
Oh, calm yourself.

1115
01:13:05,416 --> 01:13:06,665
And if it hadn't been
for your pill-popping ass

1116
01:13:06,750 --> 01:13:08,249
getting Squirrel fucked-up all night,

1117
01:13:08,333 --> 01:13:10,333
I think he'd still be sitting
right the fuck there.

1118
01:13:11,166 --> 01:13:12,957
- You trying to put that on me right now?
- Oh, fuck.

1119
01:13:13,041 --> 01:13:14,790
I'm just saying what
everybody else here wants to say,

1120
01:13:14,875 --> 01:13:17,207
but they can't do it because
they don't have the fucking...

1121
01:13:18,916 --> 01:13:20,457
All right, man?

1122
01:13:21,833 --> 01:13:22,833
(grunting)

1123
01:13:23,208 --> 01:13:24,582
(Ollie) Get off!

1124
01:13:24,875 --> 01:13:25,875
Shut the fuck up!

1125
01:13:30,958 --> 01:13:32,749
I'm so fucking done with you.

1126
01:13:36,750 --> 01:13:38,957
(panting)

1127
01:13:41,166 --> 01:13:43,707
Fuck him.
And fuck Paige, too. You know what?

1128
01:13:43,791 --> 01:13:45,749
Those motherfuckers
are perfect for each other.

1129
01:13:59,208 --> 01:14:00,832
(Mason) Fucking Squirrel.

1130
01:14:02,041 --> 01:14:03,665
(Cole) Can't believe he's gone.

1131
01:14:07,083 --> 01:14:08,290
(Sophie on recording) Hey, are you here?

1132
01:14:08,375 --> 01:14:10,457
I'm at the Ferris wheel. Come find me.

1133
01:14:11,125 --> 01:14:12,540
I love it here.

1134
01:14:14,666 --> 01:14:15,790
Hey, are you here?

1135
01:14:15,875 --> 01:14:18,707
I'm at the Ferris wheel. Come find me.

1136
01:14:18,875 --> 01:14:20,082
I love it here.

1137
01:14:26,250 --> 01:14:29,915
(Squirrel on recording) I've been
applying for jobs at a few places.

1138
01:14:31,541 --> 01:14:32,915
Entry-level positions.

1139
01:14:35,916 --> 01:14:37,457
Wait, are you recording this?

1140
01:14:43,666 --> 01:14:44,957
Oh, great.

1141
01:14:45,041 --> 01:14:46,790
It's my favourite person.

1142
01:14:57,625 --> 01:15:00,707
- I'm good.
- Yeah, I'm not offering you one.

1143
01:15:02,666 --> 01:15:05,165
- That's okay.
- Yeah. I know it's okay.

1144
01:15:05,791 --> 01:15:08,249
You fucked my girlfriend
and you called me washed-up.

1145
01:15:08,416 --> 01:15:09,749
Those weren't my exact words.

1146
01:15:09,833 --> 01:15:13,332
You twentysomethings, man,
you're all about that.

1147
01:15:13,416 --> 01:15:16,124
Sharing your acute observations.

1148
01:15:20,083 --> 01:15:22,415
I know I messed up, man.

1149
01:15:23,750 --> 01:15:24,957
I'm sorry.

1150
01:15:27,333 --> 01:15:30,457
- Is that why you came over here?
- Mostly.

1151
01:15:30,625 --> 01:15:32,832
- You look like shit.
- So do you.

1152
01:15:32,916 --> 01:15:34,749
Yeah, well, I actually feel terrific.

1153
01:15:38,250 --> 01:15:40,832
Did you know Sophie moved to the Valley?

1154
01:15:41,250 --> 01:15:44,165
North Hollywood. Is that a real place?

1155
01:15:45,500 --> 01:15:48,499
She's making $6 espressos
at a vegan café

1156
01:15:48,583 --> 01:15:50,165
where they only serve
Fairtrade organic.

1157
01:15:52,666 --> 01:15:54,499
She's better off without me.

1158
01:15:55,541 --> 01:15:57,624
Summerfest is coming up this Saturday.

1159
01:15:57,708 --> 01:15:59,207
You really messed up on that one.

1160
01:15:59,291 --> 01:16:00,707
(Cole) I didn't deserve it, anyway.

1161
01:16:01,583 --> 01:16:03,374
What's wrong with you?

1162
01:16:04,958 --> 01:16:06,874
Squirrel died.

1163
01:16:09,458 --> 01:16:10,540
(sighs)

1164
01:16:14,333 --> 01:16:16,249
It might be my fault.

1165
01:16:16,333 --> 01:16:18,082
Oh, come on, man.
Of course it's not your fault.

1166
01:16:18,166 --> 01:16:19,540
You don't know that.

1167
01:16:20,791 --> 01:16:22,749
It's like no one thinks
they're a bad person.

1168
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:26,915
I don't think I'm a good one.

1169
01:16:35,250 --> 01:16:38,249
Man, you're not even
a real person until you're 27.

1170
01:16:38,791 --> 01:16:40,499
(rueful laugh)

1171
01:16:44,166 --> 01:16:46,082
I haven't made shit in weeks.

1172
01:16:48,625 --> 01:16:50,165
Don't let it be years.

1173
01:17:35,291 --> 01:17:36,749
Hey.

1174
01:17:36,833 --> 01:17:37,915
Hey.

1175
01:17:44,958 --> 01:17:46,207
Are you okay?

1176
01:17:47,458 --> 01:17:48,582
Yeah.

1177
01:17:50,583 --> 01:17:53,499
So, like, do you like working here?

1178
01:17:55,041 --> 01:17:56,749
(chuckling) No?

1179
01:17:56,833 --> 01:17:58,040
I mean, the tips are shitty

1180
01:17:58,125 --> 01:17:59,749
and the manager's always hitting on me.

1181
01:17:59,833 --> 01:18:04,499
But, you know,
if you want some free pie on Thursdays,

1182
01:18:04,583 --> 01:18:05,832
I might be able to hook it up.

1183
01:18:05,916 --> 01:18:08,076
- Oh, shit. (Laughing)
- No promises, though, I mean...

1184
01:18:09,250 --> 01:18:10,582
All right.

1185
01:18:16,666 --> 01:18:18,290
(dance music playing on headphones)

1186
01:18:30,500 --> 01:18:31,874
(music stops)

1187
01:18:38,125 --> 01:18:39,249
Shit!

1188
01:18:40,875 --> 01:18:42,749
Fuck that shit.

1189
01:18:49,250 --> 01:18:51,457
(panting rhythmically)

1190
01:19:00,458 --> 01:19:02,624
(helicopter passing overhead)

1191
01:19:05,791 --> 01:19:07,165
(electrical wires humming)

1192
01:19:14,208 --> 01:19:15,707
(chiming)

1193
01:19:17,416 --> 01:19:18,832
(birdsong)

1194
01:19:29,875 --> 01:19:31,874
(nail gun firing)

1195
01:19:43,750 --> 01:19:44,790
What are you doing?

1196
01:19:44,875 --> 01:19:47,624
Hold on. Just keep going. Keep going.

1197
01:20:43,750 --> 01:20:45,582
(gulls cry)

1198
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:52,749
(panting)

1199
01:21:07,583 --> 01:21:10,040
- James.
- What's up?

1200
01:21:10,125 --> 01:21:12,124
Can we talk about Summerfest real fast?

1201
01:21:13,500 --> 01:21:15,332
I think I have something.

1202
01:21:17,208 --> 01:21:19,082
I'm playing Summerfest tomorrow.

1203
01:21:20,083 --> 01:21:21,207
(sighs)

1204
01:21:21,291 --> 01:21:22,665
That's fucking awesome.

1205
01:21:24,625 --> 01:21:26,290
Congratulations, man.

1206
01:22:13,708 --> 01:22:14,790
What's up, guys?

1207
01:22:15,791 --> 01:22:17,249
How you doing? That's my boy Cole.

1208
01:22:17,333 --> 01:22:20,374
Fellas. That's my boy Cole.
Cole's opening for me.

1209
01:22:22,791 --> 01:22:24,290
All right.

1210
01:22:26,791 --> 01:22:28,540
(crowd cheering)

1211
01:22:42,333 --> 01:22:44,290
That's a lot of beating hearts
out there.

1212
01:22:45,541 --> 01:22:47,332
Think you can handle it?

1213
01:23:33,958 --> 01:23:34,999
What's up?

1214
01:23:36,583 --> 01:23:38,040
I'm Cole Carter.

1215
01:23:46,958 --> 01:23:49,082
(plays sample of wires humming)

1216
01:23:58,875 --> 01:24:00,874
(sustained synth chords)

1217
01:24:09,583 --> 01:24:11,082
(plays sample of helicopter blades)

1218
01:24:14,250 --> 01:24:15,957
(slows helicopter sample down)

1219
01:24:24,750 --> 01:24:26,582
(chiming)

1220
01:24:33,125 --> 01:24:35,165
(plays melody)

1221
01:24:47,541 --> 01:24:49,499
(adds bass notes)

1222
01:25:02,625 --> 01:25:04,332
(plays sample of panting)

1223
01:25:15,916 --> 01:25:19,124
(Sophie) I love it here. I love it here.

1224
01:25:19,250 --> 01:25:20,749
I love it here.

1225
01:25:21,291 --> 01:25:22,332
I love it here.

1226
01:25:22,416 --> 01:25:23,957
(music intensifies)

1227
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:33,040
(plays sample of growling)

1228
01:25:37,875 --> 01:25:39,957
(adds drum track)

1229
01:25:56,333 --> 01:25:58,249
- (beat thumping)
- (crowd cheers)

1230
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:22,290
Wait, are you recording this?

1231
01:26:22,375 --> 01:26:24,165
(sample of coin circling)

1232
01:26:24,250 --> 01:26:26,490
(Cole) What, you don't wanna
keep working with the group?

1233
01:26:26,541 --> 01:26:29,165
(Squirrel) I don't know. Do you?

1234
01:26:29,250 --> 01:26:31,499
Don't you feel like there's
a lot more we could be doing?

1235
01:26:32,500 --> 01:26:34,040
Like, more quality stuff.

1236
01:26:35,875 --> 01:26:39,540
I mean, Cole,
are we ever gonna be better than this?

1237
01:26:43,458 --> 01:26:45,874
Are we ever gonna be better than this?

1238
01:26:48,541 --> 01:26:50,061
Are we ever gonna be better than this?

1239
01:26:58,333 --> 01:27:00,415
Are we ever gonna be better than this?!

1240
01:27:00,500 --> 01:27:01,790
(crowd cheering)

1241
01:27:02,041 --> 01:27:04,082
(beat thuds)

1242
01:27:30,458 --> 01:27:32,332
Are we ever gonna be better than this?!

1243
01:28:12,291 --> 01:28:16,582
These days you can invent an app,
start a blog, sell shit online.

1244
01:28:18,125 --> 01:28:21,290
But if you're a DJ, you're gonna need
to start with one track.

1245
01:28:23,041 --> 01:28:24,207
And if it's real enough

1246
01:28:25,333 --> 01:28:27,665
and honest enough,

1247
01:28:28,166 --> 01:28:30,124
and if it's made of
everything that's made you,

1248
01:28:31,833 --> 01:28:36,790
where you come from,
who you knew, your history,

1249
01:28:38,875 --> 01:28:42,540
then you may have a chance
at connecting with everyone else.

1250
01:28:45,458 --> 01:28:50,207
And maybe that's your ticket...
to everything.

1251
01:29:11,666 --> 01:29:14,749
All right, everyone.
One at a time. One at a time.

1252
01:29:14,833 --> 01:29:16,749
Don't fuck with me, I'm in a good mood.

1253
01:29:17,791 --> 01:29:18,791
Who's next?

1254
01:29:23,250 --> 01:29:26,249
I'm here to enquire about
a free piece of pie that was advertised.

1255
01:29:26,916 --> 01:29:30,499
Oh, well, um, I believe
that offer is only on Thursdays.

1256
01:29:31,458 --> 01:29:33,415
But, I mean...

1257
01:29:33,500 --> 01:29:36,040
I could make an exception, I guess.

1258
01:29:44,708 --> 01:29:46,124
(Cole) This is the best part.

1259
01:29:47,541 --> 01:29:48,541
(laughing)

1260
01:29:48,625 --> 01:29:49,985
The best part of anything, really.

1261
01:29:52,041 --> 01:29:54,457
It's the moment before it starts.

1262
01:29:55,125 --> 01:29:57,249
(electronic dance music)

1263
01:31:30,333 --> 01:31:32,457
(electronic dance music)
