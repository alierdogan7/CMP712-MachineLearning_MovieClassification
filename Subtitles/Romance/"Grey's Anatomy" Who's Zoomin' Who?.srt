1
00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:07,233
[Meredith] You know how when you were
a kid and you believed in fairy tales?

2
00:00:07,307 --> 00:00:09,002
[Nellie McKay: David]

3
00:00:11,611 --> 00:00:14,842
That fantasy of what your life would be.

4
00:00:14,914 --> 00:00:17,144
White dress, Prince Charming,

5
00:00:17,217 --> 00:00:21,051
who'd carry you away
to a castle on a hill.

6
00:00:21,121 --> 00:00:24,454
You'd lie in bed at night
and close your eyes,

7
00:00:24,524 --> 00:00:27,118
and you had complete and utter faith.

8
00:00:27,193 --> 00:00:29,184
[Sighs]

9
00:00:29,262 --> 00:00:32,720
Eight hours, 16 ounces of chocolate
and 32 cupcakes,

10
00:00:32,799 --> 00:00:34,733
and they still don't taste right.

11
00:00:34,801 --> 00:00:36,393
No, these are good.

12
00:00:36,469 --> 00:00:38,198
Martha Stewart would be proud.

13
00:00:38,271 --> 00:00:39,636
Yeah, look where it got her.

14
00:00:39,706 --> 00:00:43,802
[Meredith] Santa Claus,
the Tooth Fairy, Prince Charming,

15
00:00:43,877 --> 00:00:45,811
they were so close, you taste them.

16
00:00:45,879 --> 00:00:48,643
There's something missing,
some specific ingredient.

17
00:00:48,715 --> 00:00:50,307
Why can't I remember?

18
00:00:50,383 --> 00:00:52,351
But eventually, you grow up.

19
00:00:52,419 --> 00:00:56,355
One day you open your eyes,
and the fairy tale disappears.

20
00:00:56,423 --> 00:00:58,823
Look, just call her.
Call your mother and ask.

21
00:00:58,892 --> 00:01:01,861
Most people turn to the things
and people they can trust.

22
00:01:01,928 --> 00:01:03,589
I don't want to call my mother.

23
00:01:06,666 --> 00:01:09,191
So let's go sleep at your house tonight.

24
00:01:09,269 --> 00:01:10,736
What?

25
00:01:10,804 --> 00:01:12,669
Why are we always sleeping at my house?

26
00:01:12,739 --> 00:01:15,139
- Do you even have one?
- One what?

27
00:01:15,208 --> 00:01:17,574
A house. With a closet.

28
00:01:17,644 --> 00:01:21,171
With your stuff in it.
Your personal stuff.

29
00:01:21,247 --> 00:01:23,181
Do you even have one of those?

30
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:25,783
Mmm.

31
00:01:25,852 --> 00:01:27,319
Good morning.

32
00:01:27,387 --> 00:01:29,821
- [George] Hey. You guys want a cupcake?
- Oh, no.

33
00:01:29,889 --> 00:01:31,447
Izzie made them.

34
00:01:31,524 --> 00:01:32,786
I like it here.

35
00:01:32,859 --> 00:01:36,226
You said yourself,
you liked having your things around,

36
00:01:36,296 --> 00:01:37,957
sleeping in your own bed.

37
00:01:38,031 --> 00:01:39,658
You're like a health nut.

38
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:42,563
You eat muesli every morning.

39
00:01:43,837 --> 00:01:45,828
No, I don't.

40
00:01:45,905 --> 00:01:47,930
OK, the muesli thing, you do.

41
00:01:48,007 --> 00:01:49,565
The last seven days, at least.

42
00:01:49,642 --> 00:01:51,234
Oh, come on.

43
00:01:51,311 --> 00:01:53,939
I haven't been here for a whole week.

44
00:01:55,181 --> 00:01:57,547
- Have I?
- See?

45
00:01:57,617 --> 00:01:59,881
Even they think it's weird.

46
00:01:59,953 --> 00:02:02,114
[Meredith] But the thing is,

47
00:02:02,188 --> 00:02:05,487
it's hard to let go
of that fairy tale entirely.

48
00:02:05,558 --> 00:02:09,289
Almost everyone still
has that smallest bit of hope,

49
00:02:09,362 --> 00:02:12,798
of faith, that one day
they'll open their eyes

50
00:02:13,933 --> 00:02:16,561
and it will all come true.

51
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:24,943
[Door opens]

52
00:02:25,011 --> 00:02:26,842
So I've checked the schedule.

53
00:02:26,913 --> 00:02:29,438
I start ENT On the 9th.
It's a light rotation.

54
00:02:29,516 --> 00:02:31,245
Can you get me in then?

55
00:02:31,317 --> 00:02:33,478
Oh, I'm afraid not.

56
00:02:33,553 --> 00:02:36,420
We have openings on the 16th.

57
00:02:36,489 --> 00:02:40,755
There are other options
besides termination, you know?

58
00:02:40,827 --> 00:02:42,692
Adoption,

59
00:02:42,762 --> 00:02:45,094
keeping the baby.

60
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:47,156
You think it over. Call me back.

61
00:02:47,233 --> 00:02:49,133
- I'm here...
- Put me down for the 16th.

62
00:02:49,202 --> 00:02:51,363
I'll confirm after
I rearrange my schedule.

63
00:02:52,505 --> 00:02:54,268
I know this is a difficult decision.

64
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:56,604
- You know the talking part?
- Mm.

65
00:02:56,676 --> 00:02:58,837
I'm not interested.

66
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:03,515
So, Devo, you just
had a root canal, correct?

67
00:03:03,583 --> 00:03:04,641
Yeah.

68
00:03:04,717 --> 00:03:06,912
I couldn't stop bleeding after,
literally.

69
00:03:06,986 --> 00:03:09,716
Now I'm stuck with you guys.

70
00:03:09,789 --> 00:03:10,847
Give me the bullet.

71
00:03:10,924 --> 00:03:13,893
17-year-old female hospitalized
for excessive bleeding,

72
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:16,861
post root canal.
Also a significant new heart murmur

73
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:19,990
associated with fever.
Now afebrile on antibiotics.

74
00:03:20,066 --> 00:03:22,000
If I'm gonna die,
page my mom and dad?

75
00:03:22,068 --> 00:03:24,161
You're not dying.
Where are your parents?

76
00:03:24,237 --> 00:03:27,604
In the cafeteria.
My freak father likes hospital food.

77
00:03:27,674 --> 00:03:31,838
[Burke] You're in excellent hands.
Dr. Karev is gonna run some labs.

78
00:03:31,911 --> 00:03:35,506
And I'll see you with your parents
in a little while.

79
00:03:35,582 --> 00:03:37,607
Add a bleeding time to the coags.

80
00:03:38,685 --> 00:03:42,451
So, what kind of name is Devo, anyway?

81
00:03:42,522 --> 00:03:46,117
'80s rocker.
My parents did too much blow.

82
00:03:46,192 --> 00:03:48,353
I call myself Esther.

83
00:03:48,428 --> 00:03:50,362
Nice skirt. What are you, Amish?

84
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:53,160
Get a life. Haven't you
ever seen an Orthodox Jew?

85
00:03:56,669 --> 00:03:59,729
This guy belongs in Psych.
What are you doing turfing him here?

86
00:03:59,806 --> 00:04:03,469
My gift to you. Had a seizure two
days ago and another one this morning.

87
00:04:03,543 --> 00:04:07,445
What are you talking about?
It says, "He talks to dead people,

88
00:04:07,513 --> 00:04:10,346
family thinks he's dangerous.
They had him committed."

89
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:12,008
That's Psych, not Neuro.

90
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:13,552
Didn't you go to med school?

91
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:16,714
Yes, unlike the correspondence
school you attended...

92
00:04:16,789 --> 00:04:20,384
- Oh, that would be Stanford, right?
- I learned not to jump to conclusions.

93
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:23,258
Sorry, ladies. We can't take
him back until he's cleared.

94
00:04:23,329 --> 00:04:24,796
You're dumping him on us?

95
00:04:24,864 --> 00:04:26,695
He thinks his seizures are visions.

96
00:04:26,766 --> 00:04:29,064
Hello! They're not seizures.
I'm psychic.

97
00:04:29,135 --> 00:04:31,695
[Cristina] Of course you are,
and I'm a chicken.

98
00:04:31,771 --> 00:04:33,830
Hey, genius.

99
00:04:35,775 --> 00:04:39,040
OK, Mr. Duff.
We're gonna start our workup now.

100
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:41,706
Work me up, work me down, waste of time.

101
00:04:41,781 --> 00:04:44,215
Well, humor us.
Can you grip my fingers, please?

102
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:52,452
Cristina.

103
00:04:52,525 --> 00:04:54,322
Mr. Duff?

104
00:04:54,394 --> 00:04:56,726
Mr. Duff, are you OK?

105
00:04:58,631 --> 00:05:00,690
[Breathes deeply] Someone...

106
00:05:01,501 --> 00:05:03,662
Someone what?

107
00:05:03,736 --> 00:05:05,328
Someone's gonna check out.

108
00:05:05,405 --> 00:05:06,633
Bye-bye.

109
00:05:06,706 --> 00:05:07,866
Oh, man, he's nuts.

110
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:09,305
I'm dizzy, not deaf, lady.

111
00:05:09,375 --> 00:05:11,866
Someone on the fourth floor
is gonna die.

112
00:05:11,944 --> 00:05:15,710
[Man over PA] Code blue,
fourth floor. Code blue, fourth floor.

113
00:05:15,782 --> 00:05:16,771
[Man] Got a code.

114
00:05:16,849 --> 00:05:18,476
[Woman] Right away.

115
00:05:18,551 --> 00:05:19,848
[Man] Go get it.

116
00:05:20,753 --> 00:05:23,278
[Beeping]

117
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:25,484
[Psapp: Nobody Knows]

118
00:06:06,165 --> 00:06:07,655
Fourth floor, dead guy.

119
00:06:07,734 --> 00:06:10,430
The psychic predicted
the fourth floor dead guy.

120
00:06:10,503 --> 00:06:13,199
I need someone to cover me
on the 16th. You in?

121
00:06:14,073 --> 00:06:16,098
I'm thinking about letting my hair grow.

122
00:06:16,175 --> 00:06:19,474
And maybe I won't shave.
Go for the stubble effect.

123
00:06:19,545 --> 00:06:21,240
What do you think?

124
00:06:21,314 --> 00:06:24,078
The 16th, George.
Can you cover me or not?

125
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:26,710
Uh, yeah. I guess. Why?

126
00:06:26,786 --> 00:06:29,516
It's none of your business.

127
00:06:29,589 --> 00:06:32,183
A thank-you would be nice.

128
00:06:32,258 --> 00:06:34,726
It's just that I hardly know
anything about you.

129
00:06:34,794 --> 00:06:36,591
I'm from New York. I like ferry boats.

130
00:06:36,662 --> 00:06:39,290
Enough with the ferry boats.
What about your friends?

131
00:06:39,365 --> 00:06:42,698
- I'm a surgeon. I don't have friends.
- Everybody has friends.

132
00:06:42,769 --> 00:06:44,703
I mean, who do you hang out with?

133
00:06:44,771 --> 00:06:47,831
What do you do on your days off?
These are important questions.

134
00:06:47,907 --> 00:06:49,465
Ah, important for who?

135
00:06:49,542 --> 00:06:52,340
We're having sex every night.
I think I deserve details.

136
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:55,848
- You have more details than most.
- This is going somewhere weird.

137
00:06:55,915 --> 00:06:59,715
I want facts, and until I get them,
my pants are staying on.

138
00:06:59,786 --> 00:07:02,016
Or you could just roll with it.

139
00:07:02,088 --> 00:07:04,022
Be flexible. See what happens.

140
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:05,682
I'm not flexible.

141
00:07:05,758 --> 00:07:07,988
- [Pager beeps]
- There I disagree.

142
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:10,085
Hmm. I've got to go.

143
00:07:10,163 --> 00:07:11,528
[Exhales deeply]

144
00:07:13,466 --> 00:07:16,264
We'll find these things out.
That's the fun part.

145
00:07:16,335 --> 00:07:17,427
That's the gravy.

146
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:21,769
That is what I'm talking about.
I don't want to be your gravy.

147
00:07:24,010 --> 00:07:25,602
[Sighs]

148
00:07:25,678 --> 00:07:27,771
Your daughter needs
a valve replacement.

149
00:07:27,847 --> 00:07:30,042
Tests indicate von Willebrand's disease,

150
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:32,983
which explains excessive
bleeding after the root canal.

151
00:07:33,052 --> 00:07:34,041
And that means?

152
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:37,954
Devo can't take the blood thinners
to maintain a mechanical heart valve.

153
00:07:38,024 --> 00:07:40,322
We're suggesting
a porcine valve instead.

154
00:07:40,393 --> 00:07:43,294
Porcine? As in pig?

155
00:07:43,362 --> 00:07:46,126
It's the standard of care
for someone in this situation.

156
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:48,724
Pig, huh?

157
00:07:48,801 --> 00:07:50,166
It's the other white meat.

158
00:07:50,236 --> 00:07:53,763
I don't care what you have
to do. Save my daughter's life.

159
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:56,741
[Woman over PA]
Dr. Jennings to OR 7.

160
00:07:56,809 --> 00:07:58,834
Dr. Jennings to OR 7.

161
00:07:58,911 --> 00:08:00,572
[Monitor beeping]

162
00:08:00,646 --> 00:08:03,672
I'm removing the lump now.

163
00:08:03,749 --> 00:08:07,708
Someone said you guys have
a psychic running around. Is that true?

164
00:08:07,787 --> 00:08:09,311
I did not even hear you say that.

165
00:08:09,388 --> 00:08:11,822
Predicted someone
would die on the fourth floor.

166
00:08:11,891 --> 00:08:14,519
ICU's on the fourth floor.
People die all the time.

167
00:08:14,594 --> 00:08:17,757
We're finishing up here, Mrs. Glass.

168
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:19,229
We'll take this down to Path

169
00:08:19,298 --> 00:08:22,426
and get the results
of the frozen-section biopsy

170
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:24,629
and see you in a few hours.

171
00:08:24,704 --> 00:08:26,569
The guy is just playing mind games.

172
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:28,869
I can see further
into the future than he can.

173
00:08:28,941 --> 00:08:30,704
Why do you care about this, Stevens?

174
00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:33,241
I don't.

175
00:08:34,847 --> 00:08:37,873
OK, Mr. Walker. Does that hurt?

176
00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:40,885
I can't feel anything
until you get to my thigh.

177
00:08:40,953 --> 00:08:43,183
Try wiggling your toes.

178
00:08:44,357 --> 00:08:46,018
Are they moving?

179
00:08:47,026 --> 00:08:49,119
- No.
- Damn.

180
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:51,288
I could about ten minutes ago.

181
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:54,891
Well, your spine x-rays look clear.
You fell rock climbing?

182
00:08:54,967 --> 00:08:58,061
In Snohomish. Just a small drop.
I was belayed.

183
00:08:58,137 --> 00:09:00,901
My wife and boys are on the way.

184
00:09:00,973 --> 00:09:02,565
What's wrong with me, anyway?

185
00:09:02,642 --> 00:09:04,166
Hold your legs up.

186
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:11,243
- Should I be scared now?
- Just try and relax.

187
00:09:11,317 --> 00:09:13,945
Nurse, I need a stat MRI.

188
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:17,080
Send an intern with him.
Make it Meredith Grey.

189
00:09:17,156 --> 00:09:19,090
Mm-hmm.

190
00:09:19,158 --> 00:09:21,285
[Karev] Ew. Thick, short neck.

191
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,555
That isn't good. It's hard to intubate.

192
00:09:23,629 --> 00:09:26,257
- You want me to do that?
- He's my patient. I'm fine.

193
00:09:26,332 --> 00:09:28,766
I just can't see anything yet. Suction.

194
00:09:30,770 --> 00:09:32,431
Don't break any teeth.

195
00:09:32,505 --> 00:09:34,268
I know... Don't you think I know?

196
00:09:38,077 --> 00:09:39,669
Pulse ox down 87 percent.

197
00:09:39,745 --> 00:09:41,303
Bag him.

198
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:44,076
Sure you don't want me to do that?

199
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:45,515
No, damn it! Tube.

200
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:47,280
[Rapid beeping]

201
00:09:49,455 --> 00:09:51,548
[Grunting]

202
00:09:51,624 --> 00:09:52,955
There.

203
00:09:53,025 --> 00:09:54,686
Huh. Got it.

204
00:09:58,631 --> 00:10:02,032
It's in the esophagus. Don't you
know an esophagus from a trachea?

205
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:04,092
[George] Anatomy
is messed up in here.

206
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:06,331
You trying to kill
this patient, O'Malley?

207
00:10:08,107 --> 00:10:10,575
Maybe we can send you
to practice on mannequins.

208
00:10:10,643 --> 00:10:13,976
No, it's just I haven't done this much.

209
00:10:14,046 --> 00:10:17,482
But when I have, it's... it's been good.

210
00:10:19,218 --> 00:10:20,879
It's just I-I haven't...

211
00:10:20,953 --> 00:10:23,387
Let's review the concepts.

212
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:25,754
Never take your eyes away.

213
00:10:25,825 --> 00:10:28,191
Always, always
know you can follow through.

214
00:10:29,028 --> 00:10:32,293
Don't ever follow through
on one of my patients, O'Malley.

215
00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:47,479
Botox would do wonders
for all those frown lines.

216
00:10:47,546 --> 00:10:49,514
OK. Shut up.

217
00:10:49,582 --> 00:10:51,311
You allowed to talk to me like that?

218
00:10:51,384 --> 00:10:52,942
[Hisses]

219
00:10:53,019 --> 00:10:55,954
God, you're hot...
in a Mrs. Livingston kind of way.

220
00:10:56,022 --> 00:10:57,717
See here?

221
00:10:58,758 --> 00:11:00,692
These are spikes in your temporal lobe.

222
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:03,490
It means you have epilepsy.
Not visions. Seizures.

223
00:11:03,562 --> 00:11:06,395
You think I'm epileptic?
That is so not right.

224
00:11:06,465 --> 00:11:09,628
I'm gonna order an MRI so I can
take a closer look at your brain.

225
00:11:09,702 --> 00:11:11,567
Yeah, there's no way...

226
00:11:16,409 --> 00:11:17,740
Mr. Duff?

227
00:11:17,810 --> 00:11:20,438
Mr. Duff, can you see me?
Can you hear me?

228
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:21,571
Stay with me.

229
00:11:21,647 --> 00:11:24,616
I wouldn't have picked you
for the mommy track, Nurse Betty.

230
00:11:29,488 --> 00:11:30,512
See?

231
00:11:33,559 --> 00:11:35,857
I told you I know things.

232
00:11:35,928 --> 00:11:38,726
This pregnancy thing,
you can't run away from it.

233
00:11:47,139 --> 00:11:49,107
Dr. Bailey, I want off the psychic case.

234
00:11:49,175 --> 00:11:51,200
I'll take whatever you got.
Can I switch?

235
00:11:51,277 --> 00:11:53,006
Ask nicely.

236
00:11:53,079 --> 00:11:56,310
Uh, well, this is me doing nicely.

237
00:11:56,382 --> 00:12:00,148
Look, I know the type. These guys want
everybody to think they're a sideshow.

238
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:02,847
- Let me take him.
- I don't do switches.

239
00:12:02,922 --> 00:12:04,947
I'll do your post-op notes for a month.

240
00:12:06,025 --> 00:12:08,050
Fine. I can accept that.

241
00:12:08,127 --> 00:12:09,754
Izzie, you get Psych guy.

242
00:12:09,829 --> 00:12:11,763
Yang. This is your lucky day.

243
00:12:11,831 --> 00:12:13,731
You get to be with me on breast cancer.

244
00:12:13,799 --> 00:12:17,667
There's spotting. You'll need
to do a pelvic. She's pregnant.

245
00:12:28,914 --> 00:12:30,882
See? This.

246
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:32,611
The guy's films are clear.

247
00:12:32,685 --> 00:12:36,086
There's no reason I can see
for his creeping paralysis.

248
00:12:36,155 --> 00:12:38,020
It's just so surprising.

249
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:42,288
I expected an intrusion into the spinal
space or bony spur in the pulposus.

250
00:12:42,361 --> 00:12:43,623
Well, you were wrong.

251
00:12:43,696 --> 00:12:45,857
You don't always get
what you expect, do you?

252
00:12:47,967 --> 00:12:49,628
What is your problem?

253
00:12:49,702 --> 00:12:51,294
Give me something to go on.

254
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:54,305
Anything. What are
your grandparents' names?

255
00:12:54,373 --> 00:12:56,466
- I don't have them.
- Where'd you grow up?

256
00:12:56,542 --> 00:12:58,305
Your favorite flavor of ice cream?

257
00:12:58,377 --> 00:13:00,572
Where'd you spend
your summer vacations?

258
00:13:00,646 --> 00:13:02,614
Lighten up.

259
00:13:02,681 --> 00:13:04,706
Oh, don't you tell me to lighten up.

260
00:13:04,784 --> 00:13:07,412
I'll lighten up when I...

261
00:13:07,486 --> 00:13:09,716
...feel light.

262
00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:15,292
Don't we have treatment options? I-I
mean, aren't there always alternatives?

263
00:13:15,361 --> 00:13:17,829
With this stage of invasive carcinoma,

264
00:13:17,897 --> 00:13:21,560
surgery, chemo, radiation
and drug therapy are your only options.

265
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:23,568
Can I wait until the end
of my pregnancy?

266
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:27,231
The pregnancy hormones will likely
speed the growth of the cancer.

267
00:13:27,306 --> 00:13:28,773
And the baby?

268
00:13:28,841 --> 00:13:32,572
None of these treatments
will allow the baby to survive.

269
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:37,105
Mr. And Mrs. Glass,
I understand how difficult this is.

270
00:13:37,183 --> 00:13:39,515
No disrespect, but like hell, you do.

271
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:44,654
You're going to have to make a decision
as to how you want to proceed.

272
00:13:44,723 --> 00:13:46,714
You mean my baby's life or my own?

273
00:13:49,461 --> 00:13:50,689
Yes.

274
00:13:56,936 --> 00:13:59,336
We'll have to evacuate the fetus.

275
00:14:01,974 --> 00:14:04,204
[Exhales]

276
00:14:06,745 --> 00:14:08,406
[Derek] Any changes, Mr. Walker?

277
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,471
[Mr. Walker] I can't move
my legs at all.

278
00:14:10,549 --> 00:14:12,346
He was moving his legs
when he came in.

279
00:14:12,418 --> 00:14:14,978
- What's wrong with him?
- I don't know.

280
00:14:15,054 --> 00:14:18,785
The paralysis is moving quickly,
and nothing in the MRI to explain it.

281
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:22,453
- Has Tommy been under stress lately?
- You know what's making me stressed?

282
00:14:22,528 --> 00:14:24,996
Being in here
and not being able to move.

283
00:14:25,064 --> 00:14:26,725
Dr. Grey.

284
00:14:27,666 --> 00:14:29,395
Emotional trauma can be converted

285
00:14:29,468 --> 00:14:31,663
- into something physical?
- Possible.

286
00:14:31,737 --> 00:14:33,762
Like hysterical numbness or paralysis.

287
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:37,798
Maybe there is no physiological reason,
and he's having a conversion reaction.

288
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:40,675
- It's psychosomatic?
- It is not in your head, man.

289
00:14:40,746 --> 00:14:43,237
- I believe you.
- [Lzzie] Mr. Duff, please.

290
00:14:45,684 --> 00:14:46,946
Who was that?

291
00:14:47,019 --> 00:14:49,351
Psych sent him down. He has visions.

292
00:14:49,421 --> 00:14:51,651
Is that it? Am I crazy?

293
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:53,817
No. No.

294
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:57,021
I'm gonna order a higher-level MRI.

295
00:14:57,096 --> 00:14:59,189
We're gonna figure this out.

296
00:15:03,802 --> 00:15:05,770
You know how important this is to me!

297
00:15:05,838 --> 00:15:07,499
This is about saving your life.

298
00:15:07,573 --> 00:15:10,064
You're not respecting it, or me.

299
00:15:10,142 --> 00:15:13,805
You're letting them put a pig,
a freaking non-kosher, traif mammal,

300
00:15:13,879 --> 00:15:16,575
into my chest, into my heart!

301
00:15:16,649 --> 00:15:18,241
The very essence of my being!

302
00:15:18,317 --> 00:15:20,342
It's a porcine valve, actually.

303
00:15:20,419 --> 00:15:23,877
I don't care what it is. If you give
me a pig part, I might as well be dead.

304
00:15:23,956 --> 00:15:26,015
[Man] This Orthodox thing
was a mistake.

305
00:15:26,091 --> 00:15:29,527
What was wrong with being
Reform like everyone else?

306
00:15:29,595 --> 00:15:32,029
You guys don't even
light candles Friday nights.

307
00:15:32,097 --> 00:15:34,258
You don't know
all the Passover plagues.

308
00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:36,699
Boils, vermin, pestilence.
Even I know that.

309
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:40,128
Miss Friedman,

310
00:15:40,205 --> 00:15:42,833
I appreciate your extreme
religious convictions.

311
00:15:42,908 --> 00:15:44,637
Fire, hail...

312
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:47,474
Simply put,
without this procedure, you will die.

313
00:15:49,415 --> 00:15:52,543
You're hotshot doctors.
You'll come up with something else.

314
00:15:52,618 --> 00:15:55,678
As long as it doesn't answer
to Wilbur and say "oink,"

315
00:15:55,754 --> 00:15:57,654
I don't care what it is.

316
00:16:07,866 --> 00:16:09,299
Your nostrils are flaring.

317
00:16:09,368 --> 00:16:10,392
They are not.

318
00:16:10,469 --> 00:16:11,800
You're into me. I can tell.

319
00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:13,963
"Dr. Small and Angry"
was a hot appetizer,

320
00:16:14,039 --> 00:16:16,735
but you, doc, are a smorgasbord of lust.

321
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:18,902
Mr. Duff, you're pressing your luck.

322
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:21,310
Would you press it for me?

323
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:23,280
I hope you're not claustrophobic.

324
00:16:26,018 --> 00:16:27,713
You're staring at me. Stop it.

325
00:16:27,786 --> 00:16:30,880
I'm looking at you, sweetheart,
but it's the strangest thing.

326
00:16:30,956 --> 00:16:33,083
I'm hungry for a chocolate cupcake.

327
00:16:33,158 --> 00:16:35,991
- What did you say?
- A chocolate cupcake.

328
00:16:36,061 --> 00:16:39,462
One of those fudgey things with
the white squiggle on the frosting.

329
00:16:39,531 --> 00:16:40,725
Could you oblige?

330
00:16:42,568 --> 00:16:45,059
What, do I still have
some chocolate on my face

331
00:16:45,137 --> 00:16:46,798
or in my hair or something?

332
00:16:46,872 --> 00:16:48,897
- What are you talking about?
- You.

333
00:16:48,974 --> 00:16:51,238
I know the drill, so keep it up.

334
00:16:51,310 --> 00:16:55,713
Next you'll be reading my cards,
telling me my dead uncle is in the room.

335
00:16:55,781 --> 00:16:58,545
- Is he?
- I don't have a dead uncle.

336
00:16:59,752 --> 00:17:01,913
I'm watching you.

337
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:08,290
[Sniffs]

338
00:17:10,429 --> 00:17:12,021
[Whistling]

339
00:17:14,466 --> 00:17:17,060
- If that's turkey, can I have some?
- It's soggy.

340
00:17:17,136 --> 00:17:21,630
- It'll kill you. Solve everything.
- I am good at intubations.

341
00:17:21,707 --> 00:17:25,006
Why does everything in a hospital
smell like a hospital?

342
00:17:25,077 --> 00:17:27,841
Don't be so hard on yourself.
Everybody makes mistakes.

343
00:17:27,913 --> 00:17:29,244
I'm good at a lot of things.

344
00:17:29,314 --> 00:17:31,839
I'm gonna tell you something.
You need to get laid.

345
00:17:31,917 --> 00:17:33,441
See that nurse over there?

346
00:17:33,519 --> 00:17:37,011
She's single.
She's got red hair. Go ask her out.

347
00:17:37,089 --> 00:17:40,490
- I intubated an esophagus.
- Dude, you're tweaking.

348
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:44,359
- Maybe you should go see that psychic.
- Mr. Duff is not a psychic!

349
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:45,692
I am trying to help you.

350
00:17:45,764 --> 00:17:49,996
Go buy her a latte
and freshen up your gonad, please.

351
00:17:55,674 --> 00:17:56,800
Shut up.

352
00:17:58,077 --> 00:17:59,772
It's not too late to call her.

353
00:17:59,845 --> 00:18:04,248
You know, moms like that,
surprises on their birthdays.

354
00:18:04,316 --> 00:18:06,113
You know, it's very Hallmark.

355
00:18:14,159 --> 00:18:15,592
I'm 47, you know?

356
00:18:15,661 --> 00:18:18,630
I'm 47 and having a baby,
which is kind of a miracle,

357
00:18:18,697 --> 00:18:21,723
and it kind of sucks,
if you see what I mean.

358
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:23,199
[Sighs]

359
00:18:23,268 --> 00:18:25,828
We'd given up
on the kid thing about a year ago.

360
00:18:25,904 --> 00:18:30,204
You know, fertility treatments,
acupuncture needles in my eyes.

361
00:18:30,275 --> 00:18:33,073
Well, not really, but it felt like it.

362
00:18:33,145 --> 00:18:36,581
It was like,
"Screw this. I want my life back."

363
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:41,716
Then one awesome night on the beach
with a bottle of merlot...

364
00:18:41,787 --> 00:18:44,119
I should have these labs back
in a couple hours.

365
00:18:44,189 --> 00:18:45,918
You get it, right?

366
00:18:45,991 --> 00:18:47,891
My hesitation?

367
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:50,451
This isn't an easy decision, I mean.

368
00:18:50,529 --> 00:18:52,053
I'm having a baby.

369
00:18:53,298 --> 00:18:55,232
You have advanced-stage carcinoma.

370
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:56,733
You're 47 years old,

371
00:18:56,802 --> 00:18:59,794
so statistically you have
a good probability of survival.

372
00:18:59,872 --> 00:19:03,740
Forego treatment, chances are you
won't see your baby go to kindergarten,

373
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:07,142
so whose life are you
interested in saving?

374
00:19:12,718 --> 00:19:13,912
Excuse me.

375
00:19:19,992 --> 00:19:23,155
[Mr. Walker] First my legs,
then stomach. God.

376
00:19:23,228 --> 00:19:26,493
Doc! Doc, my hands can't move.

377
00:19:26,565 --> 00:19:29,728
- Squeeze my fingers.
- I can't.

378
00:19:29,801 --> 00:19:31,928
Right here. No?

379
00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:34,370
Let me know if you feel this.

380
00:19:34,439 --> 00:19:36,236
How about that? Here?

381
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:40,137
Anything here? Up here? OK.

382
00:19:40,212 --> 00:19:43,079
Nothing on this side?
All right. I'll be right back.

383
00:19:43,148 --> 00:19:44,775
Nurse, cancel the second MRI.

384
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:46,545
Call down and prep OR stat.

385
00:19:47,653 --> 00:19:49,280
You're operating? On what?

386
00:19:49,354 --> 00:19:51,822
If there was something to fix,
wouldn't we see it?

387
00:19:51,890 --> 00:19:53,983
The MRI missed
a clot in his upper spine.

388
00:19:54,059 --> 00:19:56,152
I'm gonna cut him open. I'm going in.

389
00:19:56,228 --> 00:19:57,820
What if you're wrong?

390
00:19:57,896 --> 00:20:00,490
Couldn't unnecessary
spinal surgery do damage?

391
00:20:00,566 --> 00:20:04,229
If we wait longer and this expands we
have a paralyzed man who can't breathe.

392
00:20:04,303 --> 00:20:05,861
I'm trusting my instincts.

393
00:20:05,938 --> 00:20:08,930
Sometimes you've got to take
a chance to save a life.

394
00:20:12,244 --> 00:20:15,611
[Laura Veirs: Rapture]

395
00:20:20,619 --> 00:20:24,248
Your mitral regurge is getting worse.

396
00:20:24,323 --> 00:20:27,087
The valves are leakier than ever.

397
00:20:30,395 --> 00:20:31,862
Are you hitting on me?

398
00:20:31,930 --> 00:20:33,898
If you want me to.

399
00:20:33,966 --> 00:20:35,900
I hear they call you Dr. Evilspawn.

400
00:20:35,968 --> 00:20:37,993
Well, only the people that like me.

401
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:40,698
I guess that explains
the lack of faith thing.

402
00:20:40,772 --> 00:20:43,070
You know, I kind of think
of myself as a pagan,

403
00:20:43,141 --> 00:20:46,508
but, hey, that's just me.

404
00:20:49,648 --> 00:20:52,310
You know what it's like
being a teenager these days?

405
00:20:52,384 --> 00:20:56,548
My friends spend most of their time
screwing around and getting wasted.

406
00:20:56,622 --> 00:20:58,852
At least I have God.

407
00:20:59,891 --> 00:21:02,451
Well, so God wants you to die, huh?

408
00:21:02,527 --> 00:21:06,588
He wants me to be passionate
about what I believe in.

409
00:21:06,665 --> 00:21:08,257
You don't believe in anything.

410
00:21:08,333 --> 00:21:09,391
[Exhales]

411
00:21:09,468 --> 00:21:11,834
My mother used to pray
to Saint Jude for me.

412
00:21:11,903 --> 00:21:13,530
How appropriate.

413
00:21:13,605 --> 00:21:15,869
Patron saint of lost causes.

414
00:21:15,941 --> 00:21:18,466
[Laughs] Mmm.

415
00:21:24,616 --> 00:21:26,777
I did an angio on my Psych case.

416
00:21:26,852 --> 00:21:30,720
The MRI came out clean, but I saw
a ditzel. There's something here.

417
00:21:30,789 --> 00:21:34,054
Yep, you're right. There's
an AVM on his left temporal lobe.

418
00:21:34,126 --> 00:21:37,152
- I'll schedule the OR for tonight.
- Ohh, back up, girl.

419
00:21:37,229 --> 00:21:39,561
There's high risk
of spontaneous hemorrhage.

420
00:21:39,631 --> 00:21:42,293
The attending has to see films.
We need consent forms.

421
00:21:42,367 --> 00:21:45,131
Believe it or not, Stevens,
we have to follow protocol.

422
00:21:45,203 --> 00:21:48,639
But if the AVM looks like
it's gonna blow, we fix it, right?

423
00:21:48,707 --> 00:21:51,175
If the man needs to be fixed,
we'll fix him in time.

424
00:21:51,243 --> 00:21:52,972
Why are you moving so quickly?

425
00:21:53,045 --> 00:21:56,071
You get too involved
with your patients, lzzie.

426
00:21:56,148 --> 00:21:58,139
Why do you make everything so personal?

427
00:21:59,017 --> 00:22:00,917
It's not personal.

428
00:22:01,987 --> 00:22:03,750
It's not.

429
00:22:06,591 --> 00:22:08,286
Pulse ox, 98.

430
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:10,328
We've got to save this cord.

431
00:22:10,395 --> 00:22:13,193
This guy's built like
the Rock of Gibraltar.

432
00:22:13,265 --> 00:22:14,596
You want me to start?

433
00:22:14,666 --> 00:22:18,830
I'm going to cut here from
the base of the neck to the rib cage.

434
00:22:18,904 --> 00:22:20,963
I want you to hit the bleeders.

435
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:23,769
I still don't think
we should be doing this.

436
00:22:25,410 --> 00:22:27,275
- Spinal hematoma.
- We don't know.

437
00:22:27,346 --> 00:22:29,473
Left untreated are almost always fatal.

438
00:22:29,548 --> 00:22:30,845
You're cutting blind.

439
00:22:30,916 --> 00:22:33,009
Whatever happened to being practical?

440
00:22:33,085 --> 00:22:35,076
I need to see more here. Retractor.

441
00:22:36,955 --> 00:22:38,582
Wow.

442
00:22:40,025 --> 00:22:41,356
The spine.

443
00:22:41,426 --> 00:22:43,451
There's no "wow" in "practical."

444
00:22:51,803 --> 00:22:54,863
We have decided to go ahead
with the evacuation.

445
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:57,408
What the hell, right?

446
00:22:57,476 --> 00:22:59,967
Maybe this is how it's supposed to be.

447
00:23:00,045 --> 00:23:01,910
We need to start chemo right away.

448
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:03,379
We'll get everything ready.

449
00:23:07,753 --> 00:23:09,687
Have you ever done a D and C before?

450
00:23:09,755 --> 00:23:11,154
We learned at school.

451
00:23:11,223 --> 00:23:12,656
OK, uh, go ahead.

452
00:23:12,724 --> 00:23:15,488
I'll call an OB resident
down to supervise.

453
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:18,723
If she needs anything, page me.

454
00:23:32,677 --> 00:23:35,271
[Woman] Dr. Grimm to ICU stat.

455
00:23:35,347 --> 00:23:37,611
Dr. Grimm to ICU stat.

456
00:23:37,682 --> 00:23:39,513
You're using up my oxygen, O'Malley.

457
00:23:39,584 --> 00:23:41,814
How does a pompous,
cocky jackass like you

458
00:23:41,887 --> 00:23:44,617
always have women all over him?

459
00:23:44,689 --> 00:23:47,419
Little blue love pills, lots of them.

460
00:23:47,492 --> 00:23:50,017
- Come on.
- [Sighs]

461
00:23:50,095 --> 00:23:53,121
Float like a butterfly,
sting like a bee.

462
00:23:53,198 --> 00:23:56,861
There it is, a bovine xenograft.

463
00:23:56,935 --> 00:23:58,334
[Laughs]

464
00:24:00,305 --> 00:24:03,934
O'Malley, you think too much.
Can't you see it?

465
00:24:04,009 --> 00:24:08,378
You got to dance and jab.
Dance and jab. Like me.

466
00:24:08,447 --> 00:24:10,108
I am the Ali of this place.

467
00:24:15,187 --> 00:24:17,314
[Praying in Hebrew]

468
00:24:23,061 --> 00:24:24,722
[Karev clears throat]

469
00:24:25,997 --> 00:24:27,726
Does the wall ever bow back?

470
00:24:37,642 --> 00:24:40,042
It's called davening, smartass.

471
00:24:40,111 --> 00:24:43,512
This is me communing with God,
and you're interrupting.

472
00:24:43,582 --> 00:24:46,016
I've found a transplant option.

473
00:24:46,084 --> 00:24:48,177
At first, I thought maybe a cadaver,

474
00:24:48,253 --> 00:24:50,483
but they're really hard to find.

475
00:24:50,555 --> 00:24:52,785
And then I realized
Dr. Burke can transplant

476
00:24:52,858 --> 00:24:55,554
a bovine mitral valve
instead of the pig.

477
00:24:55,627 --> 00:24:57,822
She can get a cow valve?

478
00:24:57,896 --> 00:25:00,694
- Why wasn't this mentioned before?
- Dr. Karev.

479
00:25:00,765 --> 00:25:03,666
The bovine valve has only been
an option the last few years.

480
00:25:03,735 --> 00:25:05,794
It's a much more complicated procedure.

481
00:25:05,871 --> 00:25:08,431
But the best part
is it's superior to the pig.

482
00:25:08,507 --> 00:25:11,237
It lasts longer.

483
00:25:11,309 --> 00:25:14,244
What small fraction
of your brain were you using?

484
00:25:14,312 --> 00:25:15,779
- What?
- Correct me if wrong,

485
00:25:15,847 --> 00:25:20,045
but did you not present an alternative
without consulting your attending first?

486
00:25:20,118 --> 00:25:23,383
- I thought you'd be...
- Impressed? That's just stupid.

487
00:25:23,455 --> 00:25:25,480
- Sorry...
- We're finished here, Karev.

488
00:25:25,557 --> 00:25:27,388
You're off this case.

489
00:25:42,207 --> 00:25:45,938
You need to sign these consent forms
so we can proceed with your surgery.

490
00:25:46,011 --> 00:25:48,411
I'm not signing anything
unless it's got my name

491
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:50,471
followed by a whole bunch of zeros.

492
00:25:50,549 --> 00:25:53,882
Look, the AVM is located
in this crucial part of the brain.

493
00:25:53,952 --> 00:25:56,045
A tangle of blood vessels
that could burst

494
00:25:56,121 --> 00:25:58,112
and affect speech, among other things.

495
00:25:58,189 --> 00:26:01,215
- We know your visions are seizures.
- Do you?

496
00:26:01,293 --> 00:26:03,853
- Do I what?
- Know they're seizures.

497
00:26:03,929 --> 00:26:07,057
You're really good
at reading people, aren't you?

498
00:26:07,132 --> 00:26:08,929
Telling them what they want to hear?

499
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:12,902
There's an unfortunate alignment
of Saturn in the house of Jupiter now.

500
00:26:13,772 --> 00:26:16,502
OK. I know what you're doing.

501
00:26:16,575 --> 00:26:19,271
You watch people,
read their body language.

502
00:26:19,344 --> 00:26:21,608
Say "chocolate cupcakes,"
I lean towards you,

503
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:23,705
so you think you're on the right track.

504
00:26:23,782 --> 00:26:26,751
You know you're having seizures,
you're milking it.

505
00:26:26,818 --> 00:26:28,308
Hmm.

506
00:26:28,386 --> 00:26:31,219
Well, we'll just see about that,
cricket.

507
00:26:31,289 --> 00:26:33,450
What?

508
00:26:33,525 --> 00:26:34,992
What did you just call me?

509
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:36,852
[Laughs]

510

[Telephone rings]

511
00:26:40,599 --> 00:26:44,126
I'm gonna do a quick pelvic exam.
The OB resident should be down soon.

512
00:26:44,202 --> 00:26:47,103
It's a short procedure.
Your husband can stay if he likes.

513
00:26:47,172 --> 00:26:49,538
- We changed our minds.
- Excuse me?

514
00:26:49,608 --> 00:26:51,337
We've decided to keep the baby.

515
00:26:52,844 --> 00:26:54,277
You have cancer.

516
00:26:54,346 --> 00:26:57,509
Can you tell me I'll survive
if I go through with this?

517
00:26:58,516 --> 00:27:02,418
Having the procedure does not
necessarily improve the outcome.

518
00:27:02,487 --> 00:27:04,955
You have quite the bedside manner.
You know that?

519
00:27:06,324 --> 00:27:10,158
My mom died of breast cancer
when she was in her 40s.

520
00:27:10,228 --> 00:27:11,695
I have that cancer gene.

521
00:27:11,763 --> 00:27:15,597
My chances are pretty much lose-lose,
whichever way you look at it,

522
00:27:15,667 --> 00:27:16,964
except for the baby.

523
00:27:17,035 --> 00:27:18,730
We're keeping it.

524
00:27:20,639 --> 00:27:22,231
I'll call down a Psych consult.

525
00:27:22,307 --> 00:27:26,073
Don't bother.
I am going to get fat and happy

526
00:27:26,144 --> 00:27:28,112
instead of skinny and bald.

527
00:27:28,179 --> 00:27:30,272
- I'm at the end...
- If you want to live...

528
00:27:30,348 --> 00:27:33,215
Honey, that's what I'm doing.

529
00:27:46,798 --> 00:27:50,598
Look, if you think you're gonna get any,
think again.

530
00:27:50,669 --> 00:27:52,967
I'm not in the mood.

531
00:27:53,038 --> 00:27:55,973
- I'm not in the mood, either.
- Good.

532
00:28:00,211 --> 00:28:01,610
What do you want?

533
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:04,046
Nothing. I just
haven't seen you all day.

534
00:28:07,318 --> 00:28:09,309
So I'm working.

535
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:18,323
I've never done
a bovine replacement before.

536
00:28:18,396 --> 00:28:20,159
I don't know what I'm doing.

537
00:28:21,599 --> 00:28:25,194
Look it up, research it
and get someone to assist you.

538
00:28:25,270 --> 00:28:26,498
[Scoffs]

539
00:28:26,571 --> 00:28:28,698
It's not that easy.

540
00:28:28,773 --> 00:28:31,936
This is a problem
that has a solution, Burke.

541
00:28:32,010 --> 00:28:34,171
There are a lot of problems that don't.

542
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:39,876
[Monitor beeping]

543
00:28:39,951 --> 00:28:42,419
Third thoracic laminae. Nothing.

544
00:28:42,487 --> 00:28:44,853
I think I see the dura pulsating here.

545
00:28:44,923 --> 00:28:48,552
- No, it's not. Keep looking.
- We have been at this for four hours.

546
00:28:48,626 --> 00:28:51,891
Maybe he just injured his spinal cord,
and there's nothing to fix.

547
00:28:51,963 --> 00:28:55,490
Grey, when you read your books,
make sure you reference them correctly.

548
00:28:55,567 --> 00:28:58,229
Progressive paralysis
implies a pressure lesion.

549
00:28:58,303 --> 00:28:59,861
My books got me here...

550
00:28:59,938 --> 00:29:01,667
[beeping]

551
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:04,903
Pressure's up to 180l111.
The pulse is in the 40s.

552
00:29:04,976 --> 00:29:06,170
What is it?

553
00:29:06,244 --> 00:29:08,109
I'm pushing 70 milligrams Diazoxide.

554
00:29:08,179 --> 00:29:11,808
- Autonomic dysreflexia.
- Damage to the nervous system?

555
00:29:11,883 --> 00:29:14,511
BP and the heart rate are unstable.

556
00:29:14,586 --> 00:29:17,248
- We're in trouble?
- We've got to find the clot.

557
00:29:19,524 --> 00:29:21,754
I can see the cord below the dura.

558
00:29:21,826 --> 00:29:23,794
Focus, Grey. We're gonna find the clot.

559
00:29:23,862 --> 00:29:27,195
It's there. Cleanup, please.

560
00:29:27,265 --> 00:29:29,927
BP's still up. Heart rate's at 44.

561
00:29:30,001 --> 00:29:31,525
Get on those bleeders.

562
00:29:35,807 --> 00:29:37,775
Keep looking, Dr. Grey.

563
00:29:39,711 --> 00:29:41,303
[Sighs]

564
00:29:43,248 --> 00:29:45,739
Dr. O'Malley?
Our patient's pulse ox is dropping.

565
00:29:45,817 --> 00:29:47,944
She's agonal. She needs to be intubated.

566
00:29:48,019 --> 00:29:49,884
Is there anyone else who can do this?

567
00:29:49,954 --> 00:29:54,721
- You're here. I could find someone.
- No, that's... I got it.

568
00:30:01,633 --> 00:30:03,191
OK.

569
00:30:03,268 --> 00:30:05,896
- Sats down to 86 percent.
- Cric pressure, please.

570
00:30:08,540 --> 00:30:11,873
OK. I see cords. Tube. Hurry.

571
00:30:23,288 --> 00:30:25,313
Check for breath sounds.

572
00:30:31,095 --> 00:30:32,084
Clear and equal.

573
00:30:32,163 --> 00:30:35,030
CO2 detector mellow yellow.

574
00:30:35,867 --> 00:30:37,334
Smooth moves, doctor.

575
00:30:38,069 --> 00:30:39,627
Kicked ass.

576
00:30:42,373 --> 00:30:44,841
[Laughs]

577
00:30:52,617 --> 00:30:55,142
Oh, Dr. Karev.

578
00:30:55,220 --> 00:30:57,381
How long would it take
to get a cow valve?

579
00:30:57,455 --> 00:31:00,049
Oh, about 60 minutes by messenger.

580
00:31:03,194 --> 00:31:04,559
You're scrubbing in.

581
00:31:05,763 --> 00:31:07,060
Thank you very much, sir.

582
00:31:07,131 --> 00:31:09,065
This doesn't get you any points, Karev.

583
00:31:09,133 --> 00:31:11,363
I'm the only one
with points around here, OK?

584
00:31:14,005 --> 00:31:15,404
Oh, by the way,

585
00:31:15,473 --> 00:31:18,237
Devo wants a rabbi
to bless her before surgery.

586
00:31:18,943 --> 00:31:21,309
- Seriously?
- You came up with the cow,

587
00:31:21,379 --> 00:31:23,040
you can find that girl a rabbi.

588
00:31:26,251 --> 00:31:28,811
[Man] Irrigation and suction,
have it ready.

589
00:31:28,887 --> 00:31:30,821
[Woman] Right away.

590
00:31:33,057 --> 00:31:34,217
What is it?

591
00:31:34,292 --> 00:31:38,422
See for yourself.
The second thoracic vertebrae.

592
00:31:40,665 --> 00:31:41,859
[Meredith] Oh, my God.

593
00:31:41,933 --> 00:31:46,063
- I see it. It really is there.
- Of course it is.

594
00:31:46,137 --> 00:31:49,038
Let's suction and pack this baby,
shall we?

595
00:31:49,107 --> 00:31:51,405
[Woman] Suction.

596
00:31:53,578 --> 00:31:54,567
Here you go.

597
00:31:54,646 --> 00:31:56,841
[Woman] Dr. Burke to Oncology.

598
00:31:56,915 --> 00:31:59,008
You were right.

599
00:31:59,083 --> 00:32:01,313
- Is he gonna be OK?
- I think so.

600
00:32:01,386 --> 00:32:02,546
But you don't know that.

601
00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:04,781
We stopped the paralysis from advancing.

602
00:32:04,856 --> 00:32:08,087
You don't know if the paralysis
he already has will be permanent.

603
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:09,353
No.

604
00:32:09,427 --> 00:32:11,588
You keep taking everything on faith.

605
00:32:12,897 --> 00:32:15,024
How do you know
what's real and what's not?

606
00:32:15,099 --> 00:32:16,589
You just do.

607
00:32:19,003 --> 00:32:21,471
Some people
would call this a relationship.

608
00:32:21,539 --> 00:32:24,872
The kind where you exchange keys,
leave your toothbrush over.

609
00:32:24,943 --> 00:32:27,707
Who? Who would call it that?

610
00:32:27,779 --> 00:32:29,474
Me.

611
00:32:30,548 --> 00:32:32,140
I would.

612
00:32:33,251 --> 00:32:35,685
- I'm supposed to believe you?
- Uh-huh.

613
00:32:36,454 --> 00:32:38,786
- Show me something.
- [Sighs]

614
00:32:39,724 --> 00:32:42,318
Give me a reason to believe.

615
00:32:42,393 --> 00:32:45,760
[78 Saab: No Illusions]

616
00:32:55,173 --> 00:32:57,437
I have your discharge papers.

617
00:32:57,508 --> 00:32:59,908
Oh, you're not happy with me, are you?

618
00:32:59,978 --> 00:33:02,276
I'm your doctor.
It's not my place to be happy.

619
00:33:02,347 --> 00:33:06,579
My husband and child are going
to be together long after I'm gone.

620
00:33:06,651 --> 00:33:07,913
We've talked about it.

621
00:33:07,986 --> 00:33:10,352
It's our decision, and that's OK.

622
00:33:10,421 --> 00:33:13,584
- So why do you need my approval?
- I just want you to understand.

623
00:33:14,225 --> 00:33:15,783
Well, I don't.

624
00:33:19,230 --> 00:33:20,527

00:33:20,598 --> 00:33:21,997
[Knocking on door]

626
00:33:30,041 --> 00:33:31,872
I brought the consent forms again.

627
00:33:31,943 --> 00:33:33,774
You really need to sign them.

628
00:33:33,845 --> 00:33:35,938
Your surgeon scheduled the OR.

629
00:33:36,014 --> 00:33:38,107
Mr. Duff, are you all right?

630
00:33:39,417 --> 00:33:41,749
Are you having another seizure?

631
00:33:44,055 --> 00:33:46,580
Yeah. Yeah. [clears throat]

632
00:33:46,657 --> 00:33:48,056
I think maybe I am.

633
00:33:50,361 --> 00:33:51,419
What is it?

634
00:33:57,168 --> 00:33:58,965
It's me.

635
00:34:00,972 --> 00:34:02,940
I think it's about to be over.

636
00:34:04,542 --> 00:34:06,737
We know what we're doing, Mr. Duff.

637
00:34:06,811 --> 00:34:10,110
You saw the angio results.
We're catching the AVM just in time.

638
00:34:10,181 --> 00:34:12,809
You don't need to be nervous.
You're not gonna die.

639
00:34:13,785 --> 00:34:15,946
I'm not talking about dying.

640
00:34:22,226 --> 00:34:24,956
My whole life has been about what I see

641
00:34:25,029 --> 00:34:27,998
and about believing in myself,
whatever people think.

642
00:34:28,066 --> 00:34:31,035
You're telling me there's
a chance that will go away.

643
00:34:32,303 --> 00:34:34,396
Look, you're a healthy guy.

644
00:34:34,472 --> 00:34:37,032
You're gonna live a long, full life.

645
00:34:37,108 --> 00:34:38,837
If your psychic visions are real,

646
00:34:38,910 --> 00:34:42,038
you've got to believe you'll have them
when you come out.

647
00:34:57,295 --> 00:34:59,092
[Thunder rumbles]

648

[Woman praying in Hebrew]

649
00:35:43,741 --> 00:35:45,402
[Doctor] She's good.

650
00:35:45,476 --> 00:35:48,468
This is Dr. Chesney
from the Cleveland Clinic.

651
00:35:48,546 --> 00:35:52,846
He's an expert on bovine
valve replacement surgery.

652
00:35:52,917 --> 00:35:55,681
He will be assisting via satellite.

653
00:35:56,654 --> 00:35:58,281
Thank you, doctor.

654
00:35:58,356 --> 00:36:02,520
After the sternotomy
and connection to bypass,

655
00:36:02,593 --> 00:36:05,255
we're going to do
a transverse left atriotomy

656
00:36:05,329 --> 00:36:07,661
to expose the valve.

657
00:36:07,732 --> 00:36:09,597
[Inhales]

658
00:36:18,976 --> 00:36:22,503
I tried to talk Shepherd
out of that clot surgery.

659
00:36:22,580 --> 00:36:24,070
What is wrong with me?

660
00:36:24,148 --> 00:36:27,447
- Basically, you tried to kill the guy.
- Basically, you're an ass.

661
00:36:27,518 --> 00:36:30,715
You know you want it.
Come to papi, baby.

662
00:36:31,722 --> 00:36:33,155
This, uh, is George.

663
00:36:33,224 --> 00:36:36,352
George has a hot date.

664
00:36:36,427 --> 00:36:39,260
[Laughing] Oh, that's great, George.

665
00:36:40,498 --> 00:36:41,829
Yeah.

666
00:36:41,899 --> 00:36:44,459
Left pocket of my lab coat, Georgie.

667
00:36:44,535 --> 00:36:46,196
No glove, no love.

668
00:36:57,615 --> 00:37:00,448
[Sighs] My psychic had his surgery.

669
00:37:01,719 --> 00:37:03,186
Yeah?

670
00:37:03,254 --> 00:37:06,018
I wonder what happened with his... gift.

671
00:37:06,090 --> 00:37:08,490
Come on. We all know he's crazy.

672
00:37:08,559 --> 00:37:10,493
You said you didn't believe in that.

673
00:37:13,931 --> 00:37:15,330
I grew up in a trailer park.

674
00:37:15,399 --> 00:37:18,732
I waited tables, which was
supposed to put me through college,

675
00:37:18,803 --> 00:37:22,330
but my mother was always calling these

676
00:37:22,406 --> 00:37:24,966
psychics all the time.

677
00:37:26,143 --> 00:37:29,271
The bills started piling up,
so I had to use my money to pay them.

678
00:37:29,347 --> 00:37:31,872
When I turned 18,
I left and never went back.

679
00:37:31,949 --> 00:37:34,918
But this guy has been
saying things to me,

680
00:37:34,986 --> 00:37:37,887
things he couldn't possibly
know anything about.

681
00:37:39,190 --> 00:37:42,455
So I just wonder.

682
00:37:45,730 --> 00:37:48,164
Do you have sensation anywhere else?

683
00:37:48,232 --> 00:37:50,928
Some feeling in my stomach
and feet, I guess.

684
00:37:51,002 --> 00:37:53,732
- Bladder and bowels?
- Not so good still.

685
00:37:53,804 --> 00:37:56,637
The pressure stockings
help relieve clots and bedsores?

686
00:37:56,707 --> 00:37:58,038
[Grey] They do.

687
00:38:08,719 --> 00:38:11,711
I wanted to thank you for everything.

688
00:38:11,789 --> 00:38:14,349
Believing in me,
that I wasn't making it up.

689
00:38:15,726 --> 00:38:18,388
Well, I'll come back tomorrow, then.

690
00:38:18,462 --> 00:38:20,657
[Mr. Walker] I wanted
to show you something.

691
00:38:20,731 --> 00:38:23,632
I wasn't sure it would last,
but now look.

692
00:38:27,004 --> 00:38:28,835
I know it's hardly anything, but...

693
00:38:28,906 --> 00:38:31,272
No, it's something.

694
00:38:32,710 --> 00:38:34,143
It's something really big.

695
00:38:34,211 --> 00:38:35,735
[Tegan and Sara: Fix You Up]

696
00:38:39,917 --> 00:38:44,684
[Meredith] At the end
of the day, faith is a funny thing.

697
00:38:46,223 --> 00:38:49,681
It turns up when
you don't really expect it.

698
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:53,196
Mr. Duff, you're still with us.

699
00:38:55,366 --> 00:38:57,061
For your recipe...

700
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:03,037
...one tablespoon coconut extract.

701
00:39:04,909 --> 00:39:09,107
[Meredith] It's like one day
you realize that the fairy tale

702
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:12,672
may be slightly different
than you dreamed.

703
00:39:19,156 --> 00:39:21,317
[Car alarm beeping]

704
00:39:21,392 --> 00:39:23,383
Where are we going?

705
00:39:25,096 --> 00:39:26,563
Trust me.

706
00:39:31,902 --> 00:39:34,632
[Meredith] The castle, well...

707
00:39:34,705 --> 00:39:37,572
...it may not be a castle.

708
00:39:53,257 --> 00:39:56,351
Does it beat or moo?

709
00:39:56,427 --> 00:40:00,420
And it's not so important
that it's happy ever after.

710
00:40:01,966 --> 00:40:04,799
Just that it's happy right now.

711
00:40:19,850 --> 00:40:21,442
[Ringing]

712
00:40:21,519 --> 00:40:24,488
Mom. It's me. Cricket.

713
00:40:24,555 --> 00:40:26,250
[Meredith] See, once in a while,

714
00:40:26,323 --> 00:40:29,383
once in a blue moon,
people will surprise you.

715
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:31,826
I've been thinking about you a lot too.

716
00:40:35,099 --> 00:40:36,430
Where are we?

717
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:38,900
Shh, shh. I'm gonna tell you.

718
00:40:38,969 --> 00:40:39,993
All right.

719
00:40:40,070 --> 00:40:41,935
My mother's maiden name, Maloney.

720
00:40:42,006 --> 00:40:43,337
I have four sisters.

721
00:40:43,407 --> 00:40:46,604
I have, uh, nine nieces.

722
00:40:46,677 --> 00:40:48,235
Five nephews.

723
00:40:48,312 --> 00:40:51,611
I like coffee ice cream,
single-malt scotch,

724
00:40:51,682 --> 00:40:54,674
occasionally a good cigar.
I like to fly-fish.

725
00:40:54,752 --> 00:40:57,220
I cheat when I do the
crossword puzzle on Sunday.

726
00:40:57,288 --> 00:40:59,347
And I never dance in public.

727
00:40:59,423 --> 00:41:02,688
Um, favorite novel, The Sun Also Rises.

728
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:04,489
Favorite band, The Clash.

729
00:41:04,562 --> 00:41:07,827
My favorite color is blue.
I don't like light blue. Indigo.

730
00:41:07,898 --> 00:41:09,593
The scar right here on my forehead,

731
00:41:09,667 --> 00:41:12,693
that's why I don't ride
motorcycles anymore.

732
00:41:12,770 --> 00:41:14,761
And I live in that trailer.

733
00:41:17,374 --> 00:41:19,808
All this land is mine.

734
00:41:19,877 --> 00:41:22,368
I have no idea
what I'm gonna do with it.

735
00:41:22,446 --> 00:41:23,936
So that's it.

736
00:41:24,014 --> 00:41:25,948
That's all you've earned for now.

737
00:41:26,016 --> 00:41:28,541
The rest you're just...

738
00:41:28,619 --> 00:41:30,985
...just gonna have to take on faith.

739
00:41:42,032 --> 00:41:45,729
[Meredith] And once in a while...

740
00:41:45,803 --> 00:41:49,000
...people may even take
your breath away.
