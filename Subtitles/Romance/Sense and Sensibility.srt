I hear you have a fine pianoforte.

690
00:53:53,314 --> 00:53:55,648
A Broadwood Grand.
A Broadwood Grand?

691
00:53:55,816 --> 00:53:59,277
Then I shall play for you all.
We shall look forward to it.

692
00:53:59,445 --> 00:54:02,238
Good day. Walk on, walk on.

693
00:54:02,823 --> 00:54:04,532
Goodbye.

694
00:54:14,501 --> 00:54:16,502
Your sister seems very happy.

695
00:54:16,670 --> 00:54:18,338
Yes.

696
00:54:18,505 --> 00:54:21,925
She does not approve
of hiding her emotions.

697
00:54:22,843 --> 00:54:27,722
Her romantic prejudices
tend to set propriety at nought.

698
00:54:28,682 --> 00:54:33,478
She is wholly unspoilt.
Rather too unspoilt, in my view.

699
00:54:33,646 --> 00:54:37,774
The sooner she is acquainted with
the ways of the world, the better.

700
00:54:42,738 --> 00:54:44,864
I knew a lady very like your sister.

701
00:54:45,032 --> 00:54:47,742
The same impulsive
sweetness of temper,

702
00:54:47,910 --> 00:54:53,623
who was forced into, as you put it,
a better acquaintance with the world.

703
00:54:53,791 --> 00:54:58,211
The result was only
ruination and despair.

704
00:54:59,797 --> 00:55:02,966
Do not desire it, Miss Dashwood.

705
00:55:06,011 --> 00:55:09,055
SIR JOHN: Colonel Brandon's lawn
is perfect for kite launching.

706
00:55:09,223 --> 00:55:13,893
We must test your sky kite.
Mind the pretty ribbons.

707
00:55:16,563 --> 00:55:21,651
Imagine my surprise when Charlotte
and her master appeared with Lucy.

708
00:55:21,819 --> 00:55:24,696
The last person I expected to see.

709
00:55:24,863 --> 00:55:29,909
She came to join in the fun.
There is no such luxury at home.

710
00:55:30,077 --> 00:55:33,746
I'd not seen you for so long.
I couldn't resist the opportunity.

711
00:55:33,914 --> 00:55:38,167
You sly thing! It was the Dashwoods
she wanted to see.

712
00:55:38,836 --> 00:55:42,964
I've heard nothing but "Dashwood"
for I don't know how long.

713
00:55:43,132 --> 00:55:45,216
What do you think of them
now you see them?

714
00:55:45,384 --> 00:55:49,095
My mother wrote of little else
in her letters since you came.

715
00:55:49,722 --> 00:55:52,974
Are they not as she describes?
Nothing like.

716
00:55:53,142 --> 00:55:56,728
Oh!
You are quite rude today.

717
00:55:56,895 --> 00:56:00,148
He's to be an MP,
and it is very fatiguing for him,

718
00:56:00,315 --> 00:56:03,109
for he is forced
to make everybody like him.

719
00:56:03,277 --> 00:56:04,861
I said nothing so irrational.

720
00:56:05,571 --> 00:56:09,282
Mr. Palmer's so droll.
He's always out of humour.

721
00:56:09,450 --> 00:56:13,661
Oh! Here he comes!
Now you shall see, Charlotte.

722
00:56:20,961 --> 00:56:23,588
Hello, Mr. Willoughby!

723
00:56:23,756 --> 00:56:27,008
You must meet my daughter,
Charlotte, and Mr. Palmer.

724
00:56:27,468 --> 00:56:31,471
How do you do?
And our cousin, Miss Lucy Steele.

725
00:56:31,972 --> 00:56:34,474
Welcome to our party.

726
00:56:34,641 --> 00:56:37,393
Turn about.
Come round, boys, come round.

727
00:56:40,647 --> 00:56:43,816
May I sit beside you?

728
00:56:44,318 --> 00:56:48,154
I've longed to meet you. I've heard
nothing but praise of you.

729
00:56:49,073 --> 00:56:51,491
I would be delighted.

730
00:56:51,658 --> 00:56:54,160
Sir John and Mrs. Jennings are
too excessive in their compliments.

731
00:56:54,328 --> 00:56:55,995
Oh, no.
I am sure to disappoint.

732
00:56:56,163 --> 00:56:59,040
The praise came from another source.

733
00:56:59,208 --> 00:57:01,667
One not inclined to exaggeration.

734
00:57:02,878 --> 00:57:05,129
SIR JOHN:
What can this be?

735
00:57:15,974 --> 00:57:17,809
Colonel Brandon here?
BRANDON: Over here.

736
00:57:17,976 --> 00:57:19,352
There he is.

737
00:57:27,945 --> 00:57:31,239

What's the matter?

738
00:57:31,406 --> 00:57:34,242
I must away to London.
Impossible!

739
00:57:34,409 --> 00:57:35,535
Imperative.

740
00:57:35,702 --> 00:57:41,374
We can't picnic without our host.
Come up to town tomorrow.

741
00:57:41,542 --> 00:57:44,418
Or wait until we return.

742
00:57:44,586 --> 00:57:48,297
I can't afford to lose one minute.

743
00:57:48,465 --> 00:57:51,843
Forgive me.
I hope it's nothing serious.

744
00:57:53,804 --> 00:57:57,640
SIR JOHN: Upon my soul,
this is all very unusual.

745
00:57:59,726 --> 00:58:03,229
Frailty, thy name is Brandon.

746
00:58:03,397 --> 00:58:06,107
MARIANNE:
Some cannot bear pleasure.

747
00:58:06,775 --> 00:58:10,695
You are a wicked pair.
Colonel Brandon will be missed.

748
00:58:10,863 --> 00:58:12,280
Why?

749
00:58:12,656 --> 00:58:17,076
Everyone speaks well of him,
but no one remembers to talk to him.

750
00:58:17,244 --> 00:58:18,578
MARIANNE: Exactly.
ELINOR: Nonsense.

751
00:58:18,745 --> 00:58:21,622
He is highly respected at Barton Park.

752
00:58:21,790 --> 00:58:24,834
Which is enough censure in itself.
Really, Willoughby.

753
00:58:27,087 --> 00:58:31,757
[IMITATES MRS. JENNINGS] Come, come, Mr.
Impudence. I know your wicked ways.

00:58:31,925 --> 00:58:34,760
Reveal your beau.
Reveal him, I say.

755
00:58:34,928 --> 00:58:38,598
No secrets between friends.
I'll winkle them out of you.

756
00:58:38,765 --> 00:58:45,021
I'll have you married to the colonel
by tea, or I'll swallow my bonnet.

757
00:58:46,815 --> 00:58:48,316
As if you could marry him.

758
00:58:49,359 --> 00:58:51,277
Why should you dislike him?

759
00:58:52,779 --> 00:58:55,990
Because he threatened me with rain
when I wanted it fine.

760
00:58:57,409 --> 00:59:02,830
He found fault with my high flyer
and will not buy my brown mare.

761
00:59:02,998 --> 00:59:06,334
Oh!
If it will be of satisfaction to you,

762
00:59:06,501 --> 00:59:10,296
I believe his character to be,
in all other respects, irreproachable,

763
00:59:10,464 --> 00:59:12,298
then I'm ready to confess it.

764
00:59:12,466 --> 00:59:18,512
In return for this acknowledgement,
don't deny me the privilege

765
00:59:18,680 --> 00:59:22,308
of disliking him as much as I adore...

766
00:59:27,314 --> 00:59:29,315
this cottage.

767
00:59:30,901 --> 00:59:33,653
I have plans for improvements.

768
00:59:34,279 --> 00:59:36,739
Now, that I will never consent to.

769
00:59:38,116 --> 00:59:39,909
Not a stone must be added
to its walls.

770
00:59:41,828 --> 00:59:47,083
Were I rich enough, I'd rebuild
Combe Magna to this exact image.

771
00:59:47,251 --> 00:59:49,377
With dark, narrow stairs,
a pokey hall,

772
00:59:49,544 --> 00:59:51,337
and a fire that smokes, I suppose?

773
00:59:52,089 --> 00:59:53,965
Especially the fire that smokes.

774
00:59:55,133 --> 00:59:57,510
Then I'd be as happy at Combe
as I've been at Barton.

775
00:59:59,346 --> 01:00:02,932
But this place has one claim on
my affections none other can share.

776
01:00:05,852 --> 01:00:08,145
Promise never to change it.

777
01:00:13,652 --> 01:00:17,154
I'm honoured you risk your honour

778
01:00:17,322 --> 01:00:20,491
by seeing me to
the gate unaccompanied.

779
01:00:20,659 --> 01:00:23,160
That is what Elinor would say.

780
01:00:23,328 --> 01:00:25,496

an interview tomorrow?

783
01:00:32,337 --> 01:00:36,215
Willoughby, we are always alone.
But there is...

784
01:00:36,717 --> 01:00:39,427
There is something very particular
I should like to ask you.

785
01:00:41,305 --> 01:00:43,264
Of course.

786
01:00:44,182 --> 01:00:47,310
I shall ask Mama
if I may stay behind from church.

787
01:00:48,729 --> 01:00:50,479
Thank you.

788
01:00:52,190 --> 01:00:54,150
Until tomorrow, then.

Oh, Virtue.

Silently and with fear, enter the

01:01:17,924 --> 01:01:19,633
Will he kneel down when he asks her?

I am invited only once a year.

That is unlikely.

818
01:03:03,530 --> 01:03:08,534
Perhaps Lady Allen disapproves
of his regard for Marianne.

819
01:03:08,743 --> 01:03:10,703
And has invented an excuse
to send him away.

820
01:03:10,871 --> 01:03:13,706
Then why did he not say so?

821
01:03:13,874 --> 01:03:16,625
It's not like him to be secretive.

01:03:17,043 --> 01:03:18,377
What do you suspect?

823
01:03:18,545 --> 01:03:21,839
Why was his manner so guilty?

No. He loves her. I am sure.

of his return?

Cannot you ask if he proposed.

01:03:38,023 --> 01:03:43,235
No! I cannot force a confidence
from Marianne. Nor should you.

We must trust her to confide in us

communicating to me

1545
02:09:28,344 --> 02:09:33,306
the transfer of her affections
to my brother Robert.

1546
02:09:34,225 --> 02:09:38,019
It seems they were much
thrown together in London.

1547
02:09:39,439 --> 02:09:44,818
In view of my new circumstances,
I felt it only right

1548
02:09:44,986 --> 02:09:48,864
that she be released
from our engagement.

1549
02:09:49,782 --> 02:09:53,910
At any rate, they were married
last week in Plymouth.

1550
02:09:59,959 --> 02:10:01,877
Then you...

1551
02:10:04,881 --> 02:10:06,256
are not married?

1552
02:10:08,593 --> 02:10:10,552
No.

Elinor,

1554
02:10:40,875 --> 02:10:44,252
I met Lucy when I was very young.

1555
02:10:44,420 --> 02:10:50,258
Had I had a profession, I would not
have felt such an idle inclination.

1556
02:10:51,260 --> 02:10:54,179
My behaviour at Norland
was very wrong.

1557
02:10:54,347 --> 02:10:57,933
I convinced myself that
you felt only friendship for me,

1558
02:10:58,100 --> 02:11:01,937
and that it was my heart alone
that I was risking.

1559
02:11:02,396 --> 02:11:05,774
I have come with no expectations,

1560
02:11:05,942 --> 02:11:08,985
only to profess, now I am able,

1561
02:11:10,571 --> 02:11:16,535
that my heart is, and always will be,

1562
02:11:18,579 --> 02:11:20,330
yours.

Margaret, come down.

Will you stop that?
What else?

1567
02:11:40,142 --> 02:11:42,519
Oh, Marianne.
Tell us!

1568
02:11:42,687 --> 02:11:44,020
Wait.
