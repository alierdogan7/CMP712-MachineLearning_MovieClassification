I'm not sure what it is that's wrong.

352
00:20:43,243 --> 00:20:47,622
But Mike is my... is my boss,
and he's an absolute genius.

353
00:20:47,747 --> 00:20:49,624
We're gonna get it fixed.
You guys just wait right here.

354
00:20:49,749 --> 00:20:52,449
Okay? Okay?

355
00:20:58,424 --> 00:21:00,234
Hey, see that car?

356
00:21:00,359 --> 00:21:01,668
It's been cruising back and forth

357
00:21:01,793 --> 00:21:03,269
since we got here.

358
00:21:03,394 --> 00:21:05,838
I saw it five times already.

359
00:21:05,963 --> 00:21:07,873
It's a taxicab, Eugene.

360
00:21:07,998 --> 00:21:10,208
Think, man.

361
00:21:10,333 --> 00:21:13,477
Who the fuck would need taxi here?

362
00:21:13,602 --> 00:21:16,146
I don't... I don't know.
What are you trying to say?

363
00:21:16,271 --> 00:21:18,148
Look at the driver.

364
00:21:18,273 --> 00:21:20,450
Why?
He's arab.

365
00:21:20,575 --> 00:21:23,653
You've never seen
an arab taxi driver before?

366
00:21:23,778 --> 00:21:25,488
Oh, sure, I did.

367
00:21:25,613 --> 00:21:27,756
But not since I offed.

368
00:21:27,881 --> 00:21:29,758
Connect the dots.

369
00:21:29,883 --> 00:21:32,727
Arabs, suicides.

370
00:21:32,852 --> 00:21:35,162
Doesn't that freak you out
even a little bit?

371
00:21:35,287 --> 00:21:37,631
No, man. You sound
like a fucking, uh,

372
00:21:37,756 --> 00:21:39,933
homeland security agent.

373
00:21:40,058 --> 00:21:41,734
I mean, you forget where we are.

374
00:21:41,859 --> 00:21:42,901
He's dead already.

375
00:21:43,026 --> 00:21:44,535
We're dead.
Everybody here is dead.

376
00:21:44,660 --> 00:21:46,937
He's not gonna try anything.
Nobody gives a shit here.

377
00:21:47,062 --> 00:21:49,639
We're all immigrants now, man.

378
00:21:49,764 --> 00:21:51,797
Then why is he looking
at me like that?

379
00:21:53,667 --> 00:21:54,643
'Cause you're staring at him

380
00:21:54,768 --> 00:21:55,944
like you need a fucking taxicab.

381
00:21:56,069 --> 00:21:58,636
Quit looking at him.
He'll go away.

382
00:22:00,506 --> 00:22:01,715
Oh, shoot.

383
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:04,184
It looks like we're
staying here tonight.

384
00:22:04,309 --> 00:22:07,353
Hey, boy, how you doin'?
You're pretty.

385
00:22:07,478 --> 00:22:10,689
Hey, Jimmy, why don't you
go start this thing up?

386
00:22:10,814 --> 00:22:13,491
Let's hear this beauty moan.

387
00:22:13,616 --> 00:22:16,894
Well... moan?
No, no. We just want to...

388
00:22:17,019 --> 00:22:18,395
shh! Shh, shh.

389
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:20,730
The headlights.

390
00:22:20,855 --> 00:22:23,021
[Engine starts, revs]

391
00:22:25,792 --> 00:22:27,268
Oh, you need a...

392
00:22:27,393 --> 00:22:29,837
you need an exhaust system,

393
00:22:29,962 --> 00:22:32,573
valves got to be adjusted.

394
00:22:32,698 --> 00:22:34,908
Oh, what a bitch
of a fuel pump you got in there.

395
00:22:35,033 --> 00:22:36,743
No, no, no, no. No, no.

396
00:22:36,868 --> 00:22:38,678
We just want to fix the headlights.

397
00:22:38,803 --> 00:22:39,812
Shh, shh. Shh, shh, shh.

398
00:22:39,937 --> 00:22:42,003
[Gasp]

399
00:22:45,908 --> 00:22:47,317
[Door opens]

400
00:22:47,442 --> 00:22:49,952
[Woman] Honey, are you home?

401
00:22:50,077 --> 00:22:52,710
Honey?

402
00:23:00,118 --> 00:23:03,363
He hasn't slept a wink
since we got here.

403
00:23:03,488 --> 00:23:06,366
[Sighing]

404
00:23:06,491 --> 00:23:08,935
We'll... we'll fix
your headlights by tomorrow.

405
00:23:09,060 --> 00:23:10,770
Get them fixed by tomorrow.
Tomorrow?

406
00:23:10,895 --> 00:23:12,928
Yeah. Tomorrow.

407
00:23:17,133 --> 00:23:19,800
[Snores]

408
00:23:41,422 --> 00:23:42,521
[Sigh]

409
00:23:48,561 --> 00:23:50,271
Fucking shift stick.

410
00:23:50,396 --> 00:23:52,273
This is the last time
I sleep in the car.

411
00:23:52,398 --> 00:23:54,275
Yeah.

412
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,610
Where are my shades?

413
00:23:56,735 --> 00:23:58,612
Mmm.

414
00:23:58,737 --> 00:24:01,448
I dr... I dropped them.

415
00:24:01,573 --> 00:24:04,517
Man, I told you to be
careful about that, man.

416
00:24:04,642 --> 00:24:06,452
I know, I know.
God damn it.

417
00:24:06,577 --> 00:24:09,288
I was, Eugene.
It's... it's so bright.

418
00:24:09,413 --> 00:24:11,023
I didn't mean to drop them
under there.

419
00:24:11,148 --> 00:24:14,659
I gotta...
I gotta piss, man.

420
00:24:14,784 --> 00:24:17,495
Aah! God damn!

421
00:24:17,620 --> 00:24:19,853
What the hell?

422
00:24:21,156 --> 00:24:22,799
[Mike] Morning, boys.

423
00:24:22,924 --> 00:24:24,000
[Zia groans]

424
00:24:24,125 --> 00:24:26,802
Nothing like a good
night's sleep, huh?

425
00:24:26,927 --> 00:24:29,304
These headlights are
giving me a headache.

426
00:24:29,429 --> 00:24:31,306
But you give me a day or two,

427
00:24:31,431 --> 00:24:32,507
I'll have it fixed up

428
00:24:32,632 --> 00:24:34,342
once and for all and forever.

429
00:24:34,467 --> 00:24:35,976
[Jimmy] That's how Mike does it.

430
00:24:36,101 --> 00:24:39,646
Once and all and for...
forever.

431
00:24:39,771 --> 00:24:43,316
[Mike] Wait. Look at this,
look at this, look at this.

432
00:24:43,441 --> 00:24:45,907
Looks like you owe me
first beer of the day.

433
00:24:47,777 --> 00:24:49,654
[Car squeaking]

434
00:24:49,779 --> 00:24:51,856
[Eugene] I told you, man.
No one can fix

435
00:24:51,981 --> 00:24:54,581
the headlights in this car.

436
00:25:01,156 --> 00:25:02,365
You asleep?

437
00:25:02,490 --> 00:25:05,067
Yeah, man, I'm asleep.

438
00:25:05,192 --> 00:25:08,126
You're missing a lot
of beautiful shit.

439
00:25:14,099 --> 00:25:16,566
Can't believe you lost my shades.

440
00:25:23,741 --> 00:25:25,474
Ahh.

441
00:25:27,711 --> 00:25:29,777
Holy shit.

442
00:25:33,849 --> 00:25:36,026
[Tires screeching] Oh, damn!

443
00:25:36,151 --> 00:25:37,894
What the...
wait. What... oh...

444
00:25:38,019 --> 00:25:41,397
Eugene, what?

445
00:25:41,522 --> 00:25:42,754
What?

446
00:25:45,024 --> 00:25:46,934
Afternoon, lady.

447
00:25:47,059 --> 00:25:49,436
Where you guys going?

448
00:25:49,561 --> 00:25:51,137
Eastish.

449
00:25:51,262 --> 00:25:52,661
Eastish?

450
00:25:55,899 --> 00:25:58,476
You guys don't have any clue
where you're going, do you?

451
00:25:58,601 --> 00:26:00,511
Well, you haven't been
here very long, right?

452
00:26:00,636 --> 00:26:02,646
Why's that?

453
00:26:02,771 --> 00:26:04,114
'Cause if anybody here had a clue,

454
00:26:04,239 --> 00:26:06,005
we wouldn't be here
in the first place.

455
00:26:07,608 --> 00:26:09,518
True.
[Sigh]

456
00:26:09,643 --> 00:26:12,387
I am pretty new.
[Door opens]

457
00:26:12,512 --> 00:26:16,557
Actually, I've been hitchhiking
ever since I got here.

458
00:26:16,682 --> 00:26:17,891
How come?

459
00:26:18,016 --> 00:26:20,526
Because I'm looking
for the people in charge.

460
00:26:20,651 --> 00:26:22,160
People in charge?
Yeah.

461
00:26:22,285 --> 00:26:24,985
Just where do you think you are?

462
00:26:26,555 --> 00:26:28,432
Hmm?
Some kind of country club

463
00:26:28,557 --> 00:26:31,568
where you can just walk
into the main office?

464
00:26:31,693 --> 00:26:33,803
Tell me, please,
when you were still living,

465
00:26:33,928 --> 00:26:35,827
did you ever try to go
looking for God?

466
00:26:37,030 --> 00:26:39,641
No. But I really didn't have
any reason to back then.

467
00:26:39,766 --> 00:26:41,442
And what reason do you have now?

468
00:26:41,567 --> 00:26:44,545
I mean, you know,
are just you sorry you offed?

469
00:26:44,670 --> 00:26:46,780
You, uh, changed your mind?

470
00:26:46,905 --> 00:26:48,715
Because, you know,
if that's the case,

471
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:50,183
and you're just waiting
for visa back home...

472
00:26:50,308 --> 00:26:52,518
Eugene, Eugene, Eugene.
What? What?

473
00:26:52,643 --> 00:26:53,852
What's your name?

474
00:26:53,977 --> 00:26:55,520
Mikal.

475
00:26:55,645 --> 00:26:57,455
What's your name?
Zia.

476
00:26:57,580 --> 00:26:59,457
Eugene.
Nice to meet you.

477
00:26:59,582 --> 00:27:02,460
Nice to meet you.
Thanks.

478
00:27:02,585 --> 00:27:04,028
So you're trying to leave?

479
00:27:04,153 --> 00:27:05,529
You don't like it here?

480
00:27:05,654 --> 00:27:07,553
[Mikal] Are you joking?

481
00:27:08,289 --> 00:27:11,901
Do you guys like it here?

482
00:27:12,026 --> 00:27:14,003
Who the hell likes
being stuck in a place

483
00:27:14,128 --> 00:27:15,671
where you can't even smile?

484
00:27:15,796 --> 00:27:18,696
It's hot as balls.
Everybody's an asshole.

485
00:27:19,565 --> 00:27:21,698
Hm-mm.
I just want to go home.

486
00:27:31,342 --> 00:27:33,519
[Eugene] I don't know.
[Mikal] I like it.

487
00:27:33,644 --> 00:27:35,521
[Zia] In the car, man. N sleeping

488
00:27:35,646 --> 00:27:36,822
all right.

489
00:27:36,947 --> 00:27:39,347
I'll go get the cashier.

490
00:27:42,151 --> 00:27:45,095
I like that it has
a window right here.

491
00:27:45,220 --> 00:27:47,186
It's nice.

492
00:27:49,657 --> 00:27:51,901
You want to try it out?

493
00:27:52,026 --> 00:27:53,702
What do you mean?

494
00:27:53,827 --> 00:27:56,004
You know what I mean.

495
00:27:56,129 --> 00:27:58,762
I think I'm gonna go
see how zia's doing.

496
00:28:32,931 --> 00:28:34,741
[Mikal] I wonder if
people who die normally

497
00:28:34,866 --> 00:28:36,699
end up with no stars.

498
00:28:37,635 --> 00:28:39,968
I really miss the stars.

499
00:28:41,104 --> 00:28:42,814
You get used to it.

500
00:28:42,939 --> 00:28:45,673
I don't want to get used to it.
I want to go home.

501
00:28:47,276 --> 00:28:49,786
This guy who gave me
a ride the other day,

502
00:28:49,911 --> 00:28:51,254
he said that he actually heard rumors

503
00:28:51,379 --> 00:28:52,905
about the people in charge.

504
00:28:53,030 --> 00:28:54,557
Um, apparently they wear
white outfits or something.

505
00:28:54,682 --> 00:28:57,526
That's a crock of shit...
white outfits.

506
00:28:57,651 --> 00:28:59,694
He was just trying
to get into your pants.

507
00:28:59,819 --> 00:29:02,596
No, he wasn't.

508
00:29:02,721 --> 00:29:04,598
He said he thought I had
a really good case.

509
00:29:04,723 --> 00:29:06,833
Oh, and what makes
your case so special,

510
00:29:06,958 --> 00:29:09,068
if you don't mind me asking?

511
00:29:09,193 --> 00:29:11,693
That I got here by mistake.

512
00:29:12,762 --> 00:29:14,639
Well, we all got here by some mistake

513
00:29:14,764 --> 00:29:16,607
one way or another.

514
00:29:16,732 --> 00:29:18,609
And believe me,
you have as much chance

515
00:29:18,734 --> 00:29:20,911
at finding your folks in white

516
00:29:21,036 --> 00:29:22,746
as zia has to find his dead princess.

517
00:29:22,871 --> 00:29:24,280
You don't know that.
Mm-hmm.

518
00:29:24,405 --> 00:29:27,283
No, you don't.
I bet he'll find her.

519
00:29:27,408 --> 00:29:31,242
Yeah. Besides, I got a hunch
she's not that far away.

520
00:29:32,445 --> 00:29:34,622
Wherever she is,

521
00:29:34,747 --> 00:29:37,291
I bet she found someone by now.

522
00:29:37,416 --> 00:29:38,592
Probably some black guy

523
00:29:38,717 --> 00:29:41,194
who hanged himself by his dick.

524
00:29:41,319 --> 00:29:43,719
It wouldn't matter, Eugene.

525
00:29:55,031 --> 00:29:57,642
You know, I was thinking.

526
00:29:57,767 --> 00:29:59,777
Yeah?

527
00:29:59,902 --> 00:30:03,135

00:40:51,548 --> 00:40:52,624
Listen, I...

703
00:40:52,749 --> 00:40:56,094
I'm sorry about all that back there.

704

It's...

705

It's just Eugene's venting.

706

That's okay.

707
00:41:02,524 --> 00:41:04,891

You know what?
It's probably gonna be hard

711
00:41:11,063 --> 00:41:13,530
for me to get a ride
with you standing there, so...

712
00:41:18,235 --> 00:41:21,069
yeah. Probably right.

713
00:41:22,105 --> 00:41:24,048
I hope you find
what you're looking for.

714
00:41:24,173 --> 00:41:25,416

stones into plants

of different objects.

take care of my car, man.

All right, nanuk.

872
00:51:42,625 --> 00:51:45,459
I guess you take care of us.

873
00:51:55,670 --> 00:51:59,615

there was a crooked tree

874

875
00:52:01,541 --> 00:52:05,186
and they grew next to each other.

876
00:52:05,311 --> 00:52:08,756
And every day the...

877
00:52:08,881 --> 00:52:11,225
Straight tree would look

Do you hear that?

1061
01:02:30,029 --> 01:02:32,673
Yeah, but...

1062
01:02:32,798 --> 01:02:34,831
It sounds like a...

1063
01:02:38,736 --> 01:02:40,936
holy shit.

1064

Let's go.

01:02:50,479 --> 01:02:53,390
How come no one in camp ever
mentioned the beach is so close?

1066
01:02:53,515 --> 01:02:55,358
Maybe they don't know.

1067
01:02:55,483 --> 01:02:58,049
Maybe we're the only ones who know.

1068
01:03:01,320 --> 01:03:02,196
Hi.

Hi.

You remember the other day
when you were talking

1071
01:03:11,128 --> 01:03:16,041
about missing things
from life and, uh...

1072
01:03:16,166 --> 01:03:17,675
How you wanted to go back

1073
01:03:17,800 --> 01:03:20,077
and I told you
I didn't miss anything?

1074
01:03:20,202 --> 01:03:21,711
Yeah.

1075
01:03:21,836 --> 01:03:25,281

When I'm here...

1077
01:03:31,544 --> 01:03:33,988
With you, I kind of miss myself

1078

01:03:36,815 --> 01:03:38,925
What were you like?

1080
01:03:39,050 --> 01:03:41,928
I was... I was happy at a time.

1083
01:03:49,659 --> 01:03:51,737
Something about being here with you

1084
01:03:51,862 --> 01:03:54,339
reminds me of that.

1085
01:03:54,464 --> 01:03:57,675
It's just, I don't know,
it's just weird to me

1086

in a place like this.

Most the people that I knew
before I got here

1090

or just completely dead already.

how privileged we are?

his body from his soul.

looking for our dog.

And then, after you offed,

1178
01:08:30,055 --> 01:08:33,166
I just cried and cried.

1179
01:08:33,291 --> 01:08:35,368

1180

reminded me of you.

how much I hurt you

He was a real friend.

1188
01:09:05,284 --> 01:09:07,928
He got me out of town,
and I started to get

1189
01:09:08,053 --> 01:09:10,697
more and more into his teachings,

1190
01:09:10,822 --> 01:09:12,498
and I just stopped crying.

1191
01:09:12,623 --> 01:09:16,602
So then king was supposed to
separate his body from his soul

1192
01:09:16,727 --> 01:09:18,403
so he could discover
the other, better world

1193

and show everyone the way.

I heard his soul calling me,

Kneller did.

Is mikal with him?

1282
01:15:33,675 --> 01:15:36,019
No.

1283
01:15:36,144 --> 01:15:37,086
Did he mention anything about her?

1284
01:15:37,211 --> 01:15:40,089
Not to me. Jump in.

1285
01:15:40,214 --> 01:15:42,647
I can't.
I gotta stay here and wait for her.

1286

How long you gonna wait, man?

1287
01:15:46,018 --> 01:15:48,518
She's an adult.
She'll find her way back.

Get in, dickhead.
We have a train to make.

1291

Get in.

1293
01:16:22,549 --> 01:16:24,959
So kneller never actually
did kill himself.

1294
01:16:25,084 --> 01:16:26,560
No, of course not.

1295
01:16:26,685 --> 01:16:28,428
He was working for
the people in charge.

1296
01:16:28,553 --> 01:16:31,464
Undercover.

1297
01:16:31,589 --> 01:16:34,800
I always had a feeling
he was an angel or something.

1298
01:16:34,925 --> 01:16:37,469
An angel? Come on.

1299
01:16:37,594 --> 01:16:38,436
Well...

1300
01:16:38,561 --> 01:16:40,438
So now that he blew his cover,

1301
01:16:40,563 --> 01:16:44,442
he'll be transferred
out of the undercover unit.

1302
01:16:44,567 --> 01:16:46,076

Where's he going?

Don't know.
Wherever the people in charge operate.

1304
01:16:50,671 --> 01:16:52,570

1305
01:17:04,316 --> 01:17:06,927
So camp is totally over?

1306
01:17:07,052 --> 01:17:09,062
Yup.

1307
01:17:09,187 --> 01:17:14,533
Turns out kneller ran it
completely illegally.

1308
01:17:14,658 --> 01:17:17,959
And on the p.I.C. Property, no less.

1309
01:17:19,729 --> 01:17:23,897
So what are you gonna do?

1310
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:26,209
I don't know.

1311
01:17:26,334 --> 01:17:27,476
I'm definitely gonna go back to camp

1312
01:17:27,601 --> 01:17:28,844
and wait for mikal,

1313
01:17:28,969 --> 01:17:32,303
but after that, I guess I'll see.

1314
01:17:34,607 --> 01:17:37,040

01:17:39,077 --> 01:17:42,121

According to kneller, in the middle
of that whole messiah hassle,

1319
01:17:52,622 --> 01:17:56,501
mikal talked to one of
those p.I.C. Guys and...

1320
01:17:56,626 --> 01:17:58,503
and asked him to check her file.

1321
01:17:58,628 --> 01:18:00,471
And I know it sounds crazy,

1322
01:18:00,596 --> 01:18:03,474
but it turns out there really
was some kind of mistake,

1323
01:18:03,599 --> 01:18:06,543
and it looks like they'll
be sending her back...

1324
01:18:06,668 --> 01:18:08,300
back to life.
