who did not want me.

546
00:40:20,516 --> 00:40:22,643
None of it would happen
to me again.

547
00:40:22,718 --> 00:40:25,653
I'd seen through it.

548
00:40:25,721 --> 00:40:27,348
I elected to grow up.

Really?

574
00:41:33,189 --> 00:41:34,622
Any particular dream or...

575
00:41:34,691 --> 00:41:37,023

Come on!
Thatwas 7-- 8years ago.

580
00:41:44,934 --> 00:41:46,868
I told you
I gave all that up.

581
00:41:46,936 --> 00:41:49,564
I-- I don't understand what
this is all about, Mr. Ragno.

582
00:41:49,639 --> 00:41:52,073
Howwould you like a show?

583
00:41:52,142 --> 00:41:54,110

Why?

588
00:42:00,016 --> 00:42:00,983
For a show in her gallery.

589
00:42:01,050 --> 00:42:02,517
This is bullshit.

590
00:42:02,585 --> 00:42:04,018
Haveyou ever sent slides
ofyourwork...

591
00:42:04,087 --> 00:42:05,247
totheThrall Gallery?

592
00:42:05,321 --> 00:42:06,720
Probably. I sent
slides everywhere...

593
00:42:06,789 --> 00:42:08,222
when I was in high school.

594
00:42:08,291 --> 00:42:10,418
Obviouslytheymade
quite an impression.

595
00:42:10,493 --> 00:42:14,088

597
00:42:15,298 --> 00:42:17,960
Sorry. They're all in hundreds.

Mmm.

601
00:42:29,078 --> 00:42:31,478
Well...

602
00:42:31,548 --> 00:42:34,517
the hundreds
aren'tthe problem.

603
00:42:34,584 --> 00:42:36,609
I just-- I don't
paint anymore.

604
00:42:39,889 --> 00:42:42,084

610
00:42:51,534 --> 00:42:54,731
Who'd gotten
mylife in order? Me.

Cocktails ready, Thomas?

616
00:43:06,983 --> 00:43:10,009
Uh, no. It's-- It's me.
It's Finn.

That hook is in deep,
isn't it, dear?

620
00:43:18,728 --> 00:43:20,923
Actually, I came
to askyou a question.

621
00:43:20,997 --> 00:43:23,431
I see.
After nearly 10years...

622
00:43:23,499 --> 00:43:25,490
without a word,
without a visit.

623
00:43:25,568 --> 00:43:29,334
Come to interrogate me.
How interesting.

624
00:43:29,405 --> 00:43:31,100
I'm sorry.
Things happened.

625
00:43:31,174 --> 00:43:32,607

633
00:44:05,408 --> 00:44:09,367
Ms. Dinsmoor, a lawyer
named Ragno came to see me.

634
00:44:09,445 --> 00:44:10,537
Spider.

635
00:44:10,613 --> 00:44:12,410
You know him?

636
00:44:12,482 --> 00:44:14,609
Ragno means "spider"
in Italian.

637
00:44:14,684 --> 00:44:17,175
You must learn
other languages, Finn.

638
00:44:17,253 --> 00:44:19,687
This lawyer Ragno
says he represents...

639
00:44:19,756 --> 00:44:21,951
an art gallery owner
in NewYork...

640
00:44:22,025 --> 00:44:23,151

644
00:44:28,031 --> 00:44:31,262
I wanted to ask. Did you
know anything aboutthis?

645
00:44:32,535 --> 00:44:35,060
Estella's in NewYork.

646
00:44:35,138 --> 00:44:37,766

00:45:47,777 --> 00:45:49,938
I can't--
I can't do it?

Good, because I think
I have somebody interested.

the beginning of something.

It was a gift,
and it was still mine.

723
00:49:00,001 --> 00:49:01,696
And everything else
was less real.

What could it mean,
that picture ofthe world?

But when it's true...

726
00:49:07,809 --> 00:49:09,936
we recognize it...

727
00:49:10,011 --> 00:49:11,638
in ourselves, in others.

728
00:49:11,712 --> 00:49:14,010
We recognize it,
like love--

729
00:49:14,081 --> 00:49:16,311
completely undeserved.

730
00:49:34,435 --> 00:49:35,402
You're drooling.

731
00:49:38,339 --> 00:49:39,271
So...

732
00:49:39,340 --> 00:49:41,274
Finn Bell...

733
00:49:41,342 --> 00:49:42,775
in New York.

734
00:49:42,844 --> 00:49:44,436
That's right.

735
00:49:44,512 --> 00:49:45,740
You know,
I thought I sawyou...

736
00:49:45,813 --> 00:49:47,371
Iastwinter around Christmas.

737
00:49:47,448 --> 00:49:48,506
I was driving down Fifth.

738
00:49:48,583 --> 00:49:49,948
Itwas mobbed.

739
00:49:50,017 --> 00:49:51,848
No, itwasn't me.
I just got here.

740
00:49:51,919 --> 00:49:53,147
Well, actually,
nowthat I seeyou...

741
00:49:53,221 --> 00:49:54,779
this guywas...

742
00:49:54,856 --> 00:49:55,982
bigger.

743
00:49:56,057 --> 00:49:57,183
Bigger?

744
00:49:57,258 --> 00:49:58,691
Fatter.

745
00:49:58,759 --> 00:49:59,691
Mm-hmm.

746
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:01,125
And he had this long hair--

747
00:50:01,195 --> 00:50:02,526
Yeah? You thought
thatwas me?

748
00:50:02,597 --> 00:50:04,588
Well,you know, I hadn't
seen you in years.

749
00:50:06,033 --> 00:50:07,523
It has been a while.

750
00:50:10,071 --> 00:50:11,538
And here we are.

751
00:50:17,545 --> 00:50:18,671
I have to run.

752
00:50:18,746 --> 00:50:20,873
Well, wait, wait,
maybe we could--

753
00:50:20,948 --> 00:50:22,472
Listen, why not
meet me tomorrow...

754
00:50:22,550 --> 00:50:23,744
atthe Borough Club
around 6:00?

755
00:50:23,818 --> 00:50:25,911
I'm meeting some friends
for drinks.

756
00:50:25,987 --> 00:50:28,217
Ifyou're free, that is.

757
00:50:29,290 --> 00:50:30,222
I'm free.

758
00:50:34,095 --> 00:50:35,585
I'm glad you're here.

759
00:50:42,737 --> 00:50:46,366
Man: A long time ago,
there lived 2 brilliant artists--

760
00:50:46,440 --> 00:50:48,635
Geniuses--
Both true geniuses.

761
00:50:48,709 --> 00:50:52,110
And one day, one ofthem
was painting out in the forest--

762
00:50:52,179 --> 00:50:53,407
as artists do--

763
00:50:53,481 --> 00:50:55,574
and he came upon
this little dog...

764
00:50:55,650 --> 00:50:57,880
who was crying and whining
and obviously lost.

765
00:50:57,952 --> 00:50:59,544
Man:
A puppy.

766
00:50:59,620 --> 00:51:01,850
Please. Yes, sure,
a puppy. Fine.

767
00:51:01,923 --> 00:51:04,414
So, um, he couldn't
concentrate anyway...

768
00:51:04,492 --> 00:51:06,756
so he scooped
the puppy up-- puppy--

769
00:51:06,827 --> 00:51:08,385
and he took him
back into town...

770
00:51:08,462 --> 00:51:10,327
to find its rightful owner...

771
00:51:10,398 --> 00:51:11,797
who turned outto be...

772
00:51:11,866 --> 00:51:13,857
the prince
ofthe entire kingdom...

773
00:51:13,935 --> 00:51:16,233
who was eternally grateful...

774
00:51:16,304 --> 00:51:17,862
and verywealthy.

775
00:51:17,939 --> 00:51:20,203
And that artist's name
was...

776
00:51:20,274 --> 00:51:21,400
Michelangelo.

777
00:51:21,475 --> 00:51:22,567
True story.

778
00:51:22,643 --> 00:51:24,702
The other artist's name was--

779
00:51:24,779 --> 00:51:26,770
Nobody knows, because he was
never heard from again.

780
00:51:26,847 --> 00:51:29,111
Woman: Never heard from again.
Right, right.

781
00:51:29,183 --> 00:51:30,582
No, that's so true,Walter.

782
00:51:30,651 --> 00:51:31,948
Is it all right
if I smoke?

783
00:51:32,019 --> 00:51:32,951
Man:We've all heard
your de Kooning stories.

784
00:51:33,020 --> 00:51:33,952
You want one?

785
00:51:34,021 --> 00:51:35,045
Woman:
Oh, really, come on.

786
00:51:35,122 --> 00:51:37,181
It'syour last one.

787
00:51:38,259 --> 00:51:39,954
Oh. Uh--

788
00:51:40,027 --> 00:51:41,358
It's all right.

789
00:51:42,630 --> 00:51:43,995
Uh, so, you're--

790
00:51:44,065 --> 00:51:45,555
[Snaps Fingers]
Cigarette, please.

791
00:51:45,633 --> 00:51:46,600
You're from Florida, too?

792
00:51:46,667 --> 00:51:47,964
Yeah.

793
00:51:48,035 --> 00:51:49,900
I'm surrounded.
Everybody's from Florida.

794
00:51:49,971 --> 00:51:52,098
I'm notfrom Florida.
I hate Florida.

795
00:51:52,173 --> 00:51:53,140
Too much sun.

796
00:51:53,207 --> 00:51:54,902
- Man: Yeah.
- Really?

797
00:51:54,976 --> 00:51:58,309
Actually,
Finn was my childhood--

798
00:51:58,379 --> 00:52:00,574
Whatwereyou, exactly?

799
00:52:02,183 --> 00:52:04,583
He was my, uh...

800
00:52:04,652 --> 00:52:06,119
first love.

801
00:52:06,187 --> 00:52:07,814
Man:
I thought I was.

802
00:52:07,888 --> 00:52:09,185
Ifthat's whatyou say.

803
00:52:10,391 --> 00:52:11,483
He painted a portrait ofme...

804
00:52:11,559 --> 00:52:14,460
when I was 10years old
thatwas so beautiful.

805
00:52:14,528 --> 00:52:15,995
Woman:
I satfor a portrait once.

806
00:52:16,063 --> 00:52:17,394
Electric experience.

807
00:52:17,465 --> 00:52:18,397
Man: Great. You slept
with de Kooning.

808
00:52:18,466 --> 00:52:19,398
Can we get on
with our lives?

809
00:52:19,467 --> 00:52:20,399
I did not.

810
00:52:20,468 --> 00:52:22,026
I'd like to paintyou again.

811
00:52:23,170 --> 00:52:24,637
Would you?

812
00:52:26,007 --> 00:52:28,601
