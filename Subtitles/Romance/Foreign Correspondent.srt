- Same old daily bunkeroo.

2
00:01:58,435 --> 00:02:02,485
Mr. Powers says he wants to see that
foreign stuff as soon as it comes in.

3
00:02:06,068 --> 00:02:08,446
Don't declare war
for a few minutes.

4
00:02:22,793 --> 00:02:25,387

it is believed..."

6

Foreign correspondent!

7
00:02:29,341 --> 00:02:32,720
I could get more news out of Europe
looking in a crystal ball.

8
00:02:32,844 --> 00:02:35,814
That, uh, Stebbins cable
has a morsel in it.

9
00:02:35,973 --> 00:02:39,022
Stebbins makes me sick.
They all make me sick.

10
00:02:39,142 --> 00:02:42,988
Europe about to blow up, and all
I can get out of my foreign staff...

11
00:02:43,105 --> 00:02:45,028
is a daily guessing game.

12
00:02:45,148 --> 00:02:49,073
- I want some facts, Mr. Bradley!
- For instance?

13
00:02:49,194 --> 00:02:51,196
Any kind of facts.

14
00:02:51,321 --> 00:02:54,746
There must be something going on
in Europe beside a nervous breakdown.

15
00:02:54,866 --> 00:02:57,961
Why not try sending me over,
Mr. Powers?

16
00:02:59,705 --> 00:03:02,458
You've written a book
on economics or something...

17
00:03:02,583 --> 00:03:04,335
<i>The Twilight of Feudalism.</i>

18
00:03:04,459 --> 00:03:06,427
Yes. It was very
well received.

19
00:03:06,545 --> 00:03:08,718
Not by me. I don't want
any more economists...

20
00:03:08,839 --> 00:03:11,638
sages or oracles bombinating
over our cables.

21
00:03:11,758 --> 00:03:14,477
I want a reporter, somebody
who doesn't know the difference...

22
00:03:14,595 --> 00:03:16,268
between an "ism" and a kangaroo.

23
00:03:16,388 --> 00:03:19,642
A good, honest crime reporter...
that's what the <i>Globe</i> needs.

24
00:03:19,766 --> 00:03:21,359
That's what Europe needs.

25
00:03:21,476 --> 00:03:24,605
There's a crime hatching
on that bedeviled continent.

26
00:03:24,730 --> 00:03:26,983
Wait a minute.

27
00:03:27,107 --> 00:03:29,701
I've got something that
might pass for an idea.

28
00:03:31,737 --> 00:03:35,082
Who was that fellow that ran down
the payroll robbery last week?

29
00:03:35,198 --> 00:03:36,745
Oh, you mean Johnny Jones.

30
00:03:36,867 --> 00:03:39,495
He beat up a policeman,
didn't he, in the line of duty?

31
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:42,123
Yes, there's talk at the
City desk of firing him.

32
00:03:42,247 --> 00:03:45,046
Hmm.
Beat up a policeman, eh?

33
00:03:46,126 --> 00:03:48,299
Sounds ideal for Europe.

34
00:03:50,047 --> 00:03:52,345
Send Mr. Jones up here
right away.

35
00:03:52,466 --> 00:03:55,390

Mr. Jones.

36
00:03:55,510 --> 00:03:58,138
- He does, huh?
- You should come right away.

37

- Okay.

40

41
00:04:12,819 --> 00:04:16,244
Where's Mr. Jones?
I told you to send him right up here!

42
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:23,747
- Are you Mr. Jones?
- Yes.

43
00:04:23,914 --> 00:04:26,292

- No.
- Are you married?

- No luck.
- Single, eh?

47
00:04:34,549 --> 00:04:36,426
- Ever been in Europe?
- No.

48
00:04:38,428 --> 00:04:41,352
What's your opinion of the present
European crisis, Mr. Jones?

49
00:04:41,473 --> 00:04:43,225
What crisis?

50
00:04:45,018 --> 00:04:47,567
I'm referring
to the impending war.

Oh, that.

52
00:04:48,565 --> 00:04:51,968
To tell you the truth, Mr. Powers,
I haven't given it much thought.

53

You don't keep up with our
foreign news, do you?

54

Mr. Powers, if you're gonna fire me,
you can scrap the intelligence test.

55
00:04:58,365 --> 00:05:02,120
It's okay with me. I can get a job
on any other newspaper in town.

56

- No. Reporter.

I don't want correspondence.
I want news.

67
00:05:32,107 --> 00:05:34,610
Think you could dig up
some news in Europe?

68
00:05:34,735 --> 00:05:37,739
- I'd be very happy to try, sir.
- This is what I mean.

69

by our oracle, Mr. Stebbins...

70

had nothing to say.

Driving our readers crazy with frustration.

74

75
00:05:53,628 --> 00:05:55,505
Keynote to the European
situation today.

76
00:05:55,630 --> 00:05:58,008
Listen, Jones.

of his country's affairs
for the next three months...

78
00:06:00,552 --> 00:06:02,350
it may mean peace in Europe.

79
00:06:02,512 --> 00:06:05,607
If we knew what he was thinking,
we'd know where Europe stands.

80
00:06:05,724 --> 00:06:07,897
- A German, huh?
- No. Holland's strongman.

81
00:06:08,018 --> 00:06:10,817
One of two signers
of the Dutch treaty with the Belgians.

is going to happen... facts.

Yes. "Haverstock."
"Huntley Haverstock."

00:07:10,705 --> 00:07:14,335

- Oh, yes. Very dashing too.

667
00:48:54,874 --> 00:48:57,969
I don't care for myself,
but my father's engaged in great work.

668
00:48:58,085 --> 00:49:02,215
He's trying to help avert a dreadful war.
This is just the thing to discredit him.

669
00:49:02,340 --> 00:49:05,344
I know you care nothing about our work.
All you're interested in...

670
00:49:05,468 --> 00:49:07,470

and hotel bathrooms.

671
00:49:07,595 --> 00:49:09,347
You don't believe
I'm in trouble.

672
00:49:09,472 --> 00:49:13,852
You'll be in plenty of trouble if you don't
get out. For the last time, please go.

673
00:49:17,938 --> 00:49:21,943
Okay, but I want you to know exactly
what's going to happen when I do go.

674

<i>I'll go back to my room and try to shake
those fellows off, but I won't succeed.</i>

675
00:49:26,572 --> 00:49:30,076
They'll stick to me like a couple
of tattoo marks until they get me.

676
00:49:30,201 --> 00:49:33,580
They'll stop at nothing. I seem to
know too much, and they're right.

677
00:49:33,704 --> 00:49:36,378
I don't know the ins and outs
of your crackpot movement...

678
00:49:36,499 --> 00:49:39,548
<i>and what's wrong with Europe,
but I do know a story...</i>

679

I get it or it gets me.

derogatory opinions of me...

684
00:49:56,560 --> 00:49:57,982

685
00:50:04,693 --> 00:50:05,990
Don't go.

686
00:50:09,698 --> 00:50:12,827
Oh, I guess I could've handled
those fellows all right, with luck.

687
00:50:12,952 --> 00:50:15,205

We should get some help.

That's what I had
in mind at first.

689

690
00:50:19,583 --> 00:50:22,132

697
00:50:42,690 --> 00:50:44,738
That's strange.
We were to dine together tonight.

00:50:44,859 --> 00:50:46,623

much I meant to you.

699

Will you send somebody up
right away? Thank you.

707
00:51:07,673 --> 00:51:10,552
Operator, send a waiter up to 537.

708
00:51:10,676 --> 00:51:13,179
And ask the chambermaid
to bring up clean sheets.

709
00:51:13,304 --> 00:51:15,056
I've set mine on fire.

710
00:51:15,222 --> 00:51:19,318
And I'd like a window-cleaner, and ask
boots to come up and get my shoes.

711
00:51:19,435 --> 00:51:21,437
And hurry it up.
That's a good girl.

786
00:57:06,406 --> 00:57:08,408
Sit down.
Have a spot of breakfast.

787
00:57:08,534 --> 00:57:11,037
I know I should tidy up,
but I'm simply starved.

788
00:57:15,582 --> 00:57:18,051
So you were in Amsterdam
yesterday, Mr. Haverstock?

789
00:57:18,168 --> 00:57:20,921
Poor Van Meer. I count his death
a heavy personal loss.

790
00:57:21,088 --> 00:57:22,965
Of all people, why Van Meer?

791
00:57:23,090 --> 00:57:26,390
You can't ask "why" of an assassin.
There's no logic in killing.

792
00:57:26,510 --> 00:57:29,559
We can't spare such men
in a world like ours.

793
00:57:29,680 --> 00:57:32,308
Did you by any chance meet him,
Mr. Haverstock?

794
00:57:32,432 --> 00:57:34,560
Not formally,
but I saw him die.

795
00:57:35,853 --> 00:57:37,230
Horrible.

796
00:57:37,354 --> 00:57:41,234
As a matter of fact, I chased the man
that shot him and almost caught him.

797
00:57:41,358 --> 00:57:44,578
Mr. Haverstock is a newspaperman,
Monsieur Krug.

798
00:57:44,695 --> 00:57:47,014
That would be quite a
coup, bringing in your

799
00:57:47,040 --> 00:57:49,100

around an assassin.

802
00:57:58,458 --> 00:58:01,803
We may as well clear it up
in the study. You'll excuse us?

803
00:58:01,920 --> 00:58:04,548
Father, could I speak to you?
It's terribly important.

804
00:58:04,673 --> 00:58:08,348
This won't take a moment. Meanwhile, see
if you can't interest Mr. Haverstock...

that man doing here?

00:58:12,582 --> 00:58:13,582
It's Monsieur Krug.

808
00:58:13,682 --> 00:58:15,935
- Van Meer isn't dead.
- But I just read...

809
00:58:16,059 --> 00:58:18,107
That was his double.
Van Meer was kidnapped.

810
00:58:18,228 --> 00:58:20,276
I talked to him in a
mill outside Amsterdam.

811
00:58:20,302 --> 00:58:21,803
What has Krug to do with it?

812
00:58:21,899 --> 00:58:24,069
Remember my description
of the man in the mill?

813
00:58:24,095 --> 00:58:25,269
You mean the sweater?

814
00:58:25,360 --> 00:58:27,988
Of course! But that's impossible.
We've known Monsieur Krug...

815
00:58:28,155 --> 00:58:31,101
Mr. Krug brought Van Meer here by
plane last night. He's in England.

816
00:58:31,127 --> 00:58:31,980
They're hiding him.

817
00:58:32,075 --> 00:58:33,132
Positive about this?

818
00:58:33,158 --> 00:58:35,695
I was as close to Krug
as I am to you now.

Miss Fisher's being with him
may have caused complications.

830
00:59:08,445 --> 00:59:11,119
It would've been ideal
if she'd been in our confidence.

831
00:59:11,239 --> 00:59:13,116
Leave my daughter out of it.

832
00:59:13,241 --> 00:59:15,915

- Most unfortunate, his coming here.

I've never had to cope with this sort
of thing before, thanks to you.

But this is close to home. In fact, it is
my home. After all, I'm only a politician.

836

In a sense.

837
00:59:28,715 --> 00:59:32,060

called upon to, uh...

Yes, the little man who used to work
at your father's stables in Austria.

844
00:59:54,491 --> 00:59:58,621
Yes, I recall he was present
when a mutual friend of ours, um...

845

accidentally fell off
the high bridge at Bern.

846

Lives somewhere in
Clapham here in London.

induced to hire him...

849

851
01:00:13,593 --> 01:00:17,348

very dangerous to go about London...

It would be too dangerous.

Well, listen...

Don't you see how important it is
not to rouse Krug's suspicions?

862

- Van Meer will be killed immediately.
- Dead or alive, it's a story.

863

Johnny, Father's right.

864
01:00:51,381 --> 01:00:54,885

my own eyes, and I muzzle myself?

I'm sorry,
but this is a story with facts...

869
01:01:06,897 --> 01:01:10,652
the kind I was sent here to get,
the kind America's waiting for.

870
01:01:10,776 --> 01:01:13,575
It'll be bigger if you can wait
just a few hours...

871
01:01:13,695 --> 01:01:17,495
until we can find Van Meer and discover
what's behind this whole curious business.

872
01:01:17,616 --> 01:01:20,369
- I know what's behind it.
- I don't mean who's behind it.

873
01:01:20,494 --> 01:01:22,496
I mean the why of it.

874
01:01:22,621 --> 01:01:26,342
Dear, will you get me
all my correspondence with Krug?

875
01:01:26,458 --> 01:01:28,176
Please, Johnny,
do what Father says.

01:01:31,004 --> 01:01:33,177
Okay. I'll wait.

878
01:01:36,551 --> 01:01:37,537
I'm worried about you.

879
01:01:37,563 --> 01:01:40,251
I'm a little worried about myself.
I feel weak-minded.

880

You're doing the right thing, but I don't
like you dashing about without protection.

date and plenty to do before it.

Don't you worry. Really, now, look.

coming up here to see it, sir?

There's the houses

He had a very nasty fall.

1002

I saw that look in his eye
as he came toward me.

1034
01:11:31,771 --> 01:11:34,695
In that split second, the whole thing
flashed through my mind.

1035
01:11:34,816 --> 01:11:37,114
All I could think of was Fisher.

1036

"Fisher planned this."

1037
01:11:39,904 --> 01:11:42,657
Then I guess I just stepped aside,
and over he went.

1038
01:11:42,782 --> 01:11:45,126
Over he went, all right.
Did you want this?

No, thanks.

Good morning, Stebbins.
How are you, Haverstock?

1055
01:12:30,663 --> 01:12:33,337
Congratulations on your little

What do you know
about Rowley?

1057
01:12:37,628 --> 01:12:40,256
Very little ffolliott doesn't hear.
He probably even knows about Fisher.

1058
01:12:40,381 --> 01:12:42,179
I was onto Fisher
a year ago...

1059
01:12:42,341 --> 01:12:44,343
but that fellow
with the high-neck sweater...

1060
01:12:44,469 --> 01:12:46,847
- Krug... he's new to me...
- You're onto him too?

1061
01:12:47,013 --> 01:12:49,857
- Followed him to London.
- I thought you were cold on this story.

1062
01:12:49,974 --> 01:12:52,523
On the contrary.
I've been doing a bit of noticing.

1063
01:12:52,643 --> 01:12:55,237
- Remember that tramp asleep in the mill?
- Yeah.

1064
01:12:55,354 --> 01:12:58,528
- He wasn't a tramp at all.
- Van Meer, I suppose.

1065
01:12:58,649 --> 01:13:02,324
Not quite, but I noticed him
do a strange thing for a tramp.

1066
01:13:02,445 --> 01:13:05,289
He dirtied his hands
with some of that nasty Dutch soil.

at the same old mousetrap.

Hello, Eddie?
This is Plunger Stebbins.

the rest of this thing together?

1079

Catch Fisher, find Van Meer,
that sort of thing?

1080
01:13:41,859 --> 01:13:45,113
All right, but I'd like to know
why they kidnapped Van Meer.

1081
01:13:45,238 --> 01:13:47,741
He was one of the signatories
to a certain treaty.

1082
01:13:47,907 --> 01:13:49,955
The most important clause
was never written down...

1083
01:13:50,076 --> 01:13:52,249
just memorized
by the two people who signed.

1084
01:13:52,370 --> 01:13:54,088
They're gonna
beat it out of him?

1085
01:13:54,247 --> 01:13:57,592
They're going to try. It'd be
a good idea if we put a stop to them.

1086
01:13:57,750 --> 01:14:00,253
It contains information
that would be valuable to the enemy...

1087
01:14:00,419 --> 01:14:02,888
in the war that breaks out tomorrow,
weather permitting.

1088
01:14:03,005 --> 01:14:05,383
What? Why didn't someone
let me in on this?

1089
01:14:05,508 --> 01:14:08,432
- Stebbins, we've got to get busy.
- Plenty of time. Lunch first.

1090
01:14:08,553 --> 01:14:10,851
You mind waiting?
You might be of some help.

1091
01:14:10,972 --> 01:14:13,566
I thought up a little plan
for forcing Fisher's hand.

1092
01:14:13,683 --> 01:14:15,310
Let's have it.

1093
01:14:15,434 --> 01:14:19,029
I think the neatest thing would be
to kidnap Fisher's daughter.

1094
01:14:20,106 --> 01:14:20,841
Oh, yeah?

1095
01:14:20,867 --> 01:14:23,806
One of Fisher's few genuine traits
is his affection for Miss Fisher.

1096
01:14:23,943 --> 01:14:26,116
<i>Easy. You're speaking
to the man who loves her.</i>

1097
01:14:26,237 --> 01:14:28,786
All the better. Give you
a chance to get chummy...

1098
01:14:28,906 --> 01:14:32,501
and keep her out of this mess
while we batter away at papa.

1099
01:14:32,618 --> 01:14:35,167
This is my scheme:
I walk in, let Fisher know...

1100
01:14:35,288 --> 01:14:37,791
his daughter's in the hands
of someone who means business...

1101
01:14:37,957 --> 01:14:41,461
just as he means business when he
kidnaps people. He'll see things our way.

1102
01:14:41,586 --> 01:14:43,666
- Nothing doing.
- I thought you were a newspaperman.

1103
01:14:43,713 --> 01:14:46,216
That doesn't include kidnapping
your fiancee where I come from.

1104
01:14:46,340 --> 01:14:49,389
- It would if your country were at stake.
- This isn't my country.

1105
01:14:49,510 --> 01:14:52,480
It's your story. Don't be gloomy.
She doesn't have to know.

1106
01:14:52,597 --> 01:14:55,817
- Just keep her amused.
- Why not grab Fisher and have a showdown?

1107
01:14:55,933 --> 01:14:59,654
No good. We've got nothing
on Fisher. He'd slip out of it anyway.

1108
01:14:59,770 --> 01:15:02,444
All we'd do would be
to kill Van Meer.

Tell him how desperate these men are.

1118
01:15:29,133 --> 01:15:31,227
He shouldn't stay another minute.
Take him somewhere.

1119
01:15:31,344 --> 01:15:32,063
I won't go.

1120
01:15:32,089 --> 01:15:34,964
Couldn't you think up some aunt
in the country or something?

1121
01:15:35,056 --> 01:15:37,900
There's my Aunt Margaret at Harpenden.
Let me take you there.

01:15:38,017 --> 01:15:40,019
- How about it?
- Stay out of this.

sensible thing to do.

01:17:02,018 --> 01:17:04,771
because I've kidnapped you
from your so-called duties.

1147
01:17:04,895 --> 01:17:06,772
- You've kidnapped me?
- Mm-hmm.

1148
01:17:06,939 --> 01:17:09,442
- Just remember that, will you?
- Please forgive me.

1149
01:17:09,608 --> 01:17:11,736
Why, sure.
I don't think kidnapping's...

1150
01:17:11,861 --> 01:17:15,411
anything to get sore about when done
by the right kidnapper, do you?

1151
01:17:15,531 --> 01:17:17,249
- Not at all.
- Thanks.

1152
01:17:18,784 --> 01:17:20,752
(RINGING)

1153
01:17:24,623 --> 01:17:26,170
Hello?

1154
01:17:27,585 --> 01:17:30,964
No, Mr. ffolliott.
I'm afraid he's not in yet.

1155
01:17:31,088 --> 01:17:32,635
Very well, sir.

1156
01:17:44,602 --> 01:17:46,980
- Johnny, you don't love me.
- You're crazy.

1157
01:17:47,146 --> 01:17:50,696
- You looked unhappy when you kissed me.
- Never happier in my life.

1158
01:17:50,816 --> 01:17:52,989
Won't do.
Johnny, what's happened?

1159
01:17:53,110 --> 01:17:55,704
The war, I guess.
They say it's coming tomorrow.

1160
01:17:55,821 --> 01:17:58,574
So you've changed
your philosophy since yesterday.

1161
01:17:58,699 --> 01:18:01,248
There are more important things
in the world than love.

1162
01:18:01,368 --> 01:18:03,791
- I've got lots to do. Important things.
- Carol...

1163
01:18:03,913 --> 01:18:06,666
Got to get started.
It'll take three hours to get back.

1164
01:18:06,791 --> 01:18:10,011
I'm not going to be misunderstood.
I'm so in love, I'm going mad.

1165
01:18:10,127 --> 01:18:12,505
Won't do.
I suppose it can't be helped.

1166
01:18:12,671 --> 01:18:14,924
You've turned European
on me overnight, Johnny.

1167
01:18:15,049 --> 01:18:19,520
That's unfair. I'm just as big
a jackass as I ever was. Bigger.

1168
01:18:19,637 --> 01:18:22,015
You're not going back
to London to dinner tonight.

1169
01:18:22,181 --> 01:18:24,809
You can't run out
on your kidnapper like that.

1170
01:18:24,934 --> 01:18:27,653
I mean...
Well, you know what I mean.

1171
01:18:27,770 --> 01:18:30,319
If you run out on me now,
I'm going...

1172
01:18:30,439 --> 01:18:32,658
straight to London
and let them bump me off.

1173
01:18:32,775 --> 01:18:34,493
Be a relief at that.

1174
01:18:34,610 --> 01:18:37,989
Well, you are moody.
Am I the cause?

1175
01:18:40,616 --> 01:18:44,211
If you knew how much
I loved you, you'd faint.

1176
01:18:52,086 --> 01:18:54,214
There.
What'd I tell you?

1177
01:18:54,380 --> 01:18:57,054
<i>- (KNOCK AT DOOR)
- Come in.</i>

1178

- Yes?

1179
01:18:58,926 --> 01:19:01,054
- Call from London.
- Have them switch it up.

1180
01:19:01,220 --> 01:19:03,348
Sorry, there's only one phone...
in the office.

1181
01:19:03,472 --> 01:19:05,895
All right, I'll come down.

1182
01:19:06,058 --> 01:19:08,356
Forgive me
for a moment, dear.

1183
01:19:14,316 --> 01:19:16,410
Just a moment, sir.

1184
01:19:23,075 --> 01:19:24,418
Hello?

1185
01:19:24,535 --> 01:19:28,210
Is that you, Haverstock, old boy?
Are you alone? Can you talk?

1186
01:19:28,330 --> 01:19:32,130
I can't get a hold of Fisher.
He's been out all afternoon.

1187
01:19:32,251 --> 01:19:35,596
I'm afraid you'll have to keep the girl
much longer than we'd planned.

1188
01:19:35,754 --> 01:19:39,099
I don't know what time he'll be back.
I've got to catch him alone.

1189
01:19:39,216 --> 01:19:40,889
Keep the girl there
for the night.

1190
01:19:41,010 --> 01:19:43,263
But that's
absolutely impossible.

1191
01:19:43,387 --> 01:19:45,890
We can't let
this thing go now.

1192
01:19:47,099 --> 01:19:50,979
I can't very well explain, but I simply
couldn't pull a thing like that.

1193
01:19:51,103 --> 01:19:55,358
You've got to try. There isn't anything
else to be done. I'm counting on you.

Are you quite satisfied
with your room, sir?

1197
01:20:12,625 --> 01:20:15,674
Well, not exactly.
That is, I mean, yes...

1198
01:20:15,794 --> 01:20:18,217
but I really wanted
another room as well...

1199
01:20:18,339 --> 01:20:20,182
a single room.

1200
01:20:20,299 --> 01:20:22,768
Oh. Mr. Naismith?

1201
01:20:22,885 --> 01:20:25,479
<i>Mr. Naismith, this gentleman
wants another room.</i>

1202
01:20:25,638 --> 01:20:29,017
<i>For the young lady?
How long will you be requiring it?</i>

1203
01:20:29,141 --> 01:20:32,065
<i>(JONES) She'll only be here
just the one might.</i>

1204
01:20:34,772 --> 01:20:37,491
- The gentleman has number 7, sir.
- What about number 8?

1205
01:20:37,608 --> 01:20:39,997
It doesn't really make
any difference, so long

1206
01:20:40,023 --> 01:20:42,309
as it's a good room...
windows and all that.

1207
01:20:42,404 --> 01:20:44,156
I quite understand, sir.

1208
01:20:44,281 --> 01:20:47,080
I think perhaps the room
next to yours would be best.

1209
01:20:47,201 --> 01:20:50,375
It's quite cozy, isn't it,
Miss Pollitt? Number 8?

1210
01:20:50,496 --> 01:20:53,500
<i>- They're all very much alike to me, sir.
- (JONES) Eight'll do.</i>

1211
01:20:53,666 --> 01:20:56,419
Will you bring the young lady
and sign the book, please?

1212
01:20:56,543 --> 01:20:59,046
Yes, I'll... I'll get her.

01:21:18,190 --> 01:21:20,363

- Good evening, Stiles.

1215
01:21:26,115 --> 01:21:29,540
Terrible thing, sir, that poor man
who was here this morning.

1216
01:21:29,702 --> 01:21:32,125
Yes, terrible, Stiles.
My bags all packed?

1217
01:21:32,246 --> 01:21:34,340
- Yes, sir.
- And Miss Carol's?

1218
01:21:34,456 --> 01:21:37,801
Mrs. Stiles packed hers too.
She hopes she's put in the right things.

1219
01:21:37,918 --> 01:21:40,967
It's been such a rush, especially
with Miss Carol not back yet.

1220
01:21:41,088 --> 01:21:43,807
Mr. ffolliott's here now.
He's waiting in the sitting room.

1221
01:21:43,924 --> 01:21:46,268
Another gentleman just phoned.
He wouldn't leave his name.

1222
01:21:46,385 --> 01:21:48,173
I thought I recognized
his voice as the

1223
01:21:48,199 --> 01:21:50,210
foreign gentleman who
was here at breakfast.

1224
01:21:50,306 --> 01:21:53,435
- Did he say he'd telephone again?
- Yes, he said it was urgent.

1225
01:21:53,559 --> 01:21:55,903
Well, show Mr. ffolliott
into the study.

1226

Hello, sir.

1227
01:22:14,039 --> 01:22:16,441
Scott, you caught me
at a very busy moment.

1228
01:22:16,540 --> 01:22:18,588
I'm getting ready to go
to America tomorrow.

1229
01:22:18,709 --> 01:22:20,586
Are you taking
Carol with you?

1230
01:22:20,753 --> 01:22:24,678
Yes. She doesn't know yet. It's been
such a rush. I'm waiting for her now.

1231
01:22:24,798 --> 01:22:28,098
What's your worry? Must be important,
by the number of times you telephoned.

1232
01:22:28,260 --> 01:22:30,058
Yes, it is, sir.
It's about Carol.

1233
01:22:30,179 --> 01:22:33,433
- I'm afraid that...
- What? Anything happen to her?

1234
01:22:33,557 --> 01:22:36,276
I don't think you'll be able
to take her to America.

1235
01:22:36,393 --> 01:22:38,566
What do you mean?
Why not?

1236
01:22:39,938 --> 01:22:42,942
It'll sound rather silly to you,
but Carol has been kidnapped.

1237
01:22:43,067 --> 01:22:45,820
- Is this a joke of some sort?
- No, sir.

1238
01:22:46,820 --> 01:22:48,618
What do you mean, "kidnapped"?

1239
01:22:48,781 --> 01:22:51,330
I happen to know
she's with her aunt in Harpenden.

1240
01:22:51,450 --> 01:22:53,327
I'm afraid she isn't.

1241
01:23:04,671 --> 01:23:08,642
Stiles, who gave you the message that Miss
Carol had gone to her Aunt Margaret's?

1242
01:23:08,759 --> 01:23:11,478
Miss Carol herself, sir.

1243
01:23:11,595 --> 01:23:14,394
- Thank you, Stiles.
- That's where she thought she was going.

1244
01:23:24,775 --> 01:23:27,244
Get me Harpenden 43422.

1245
01:23:29,988 --> 01:23:32,161
Hello, is that you, Margaret?

1246
01:23:32,324 --> 01:23:33,997
Is Carol with you?

1247
01:23:37,246 --> 01:23:39,169
<i>No. No, I...</i>

1248
01:23:39,331 --> 01:23:42,551
<i>I wasn't' certain. She said
she might run down to see you.</i>

1249
01:23:42,668 --> 01:23:46,093
I didn't know whether
to expect her back for dinner.

1250
01:23:46,213 --> 01:23:48,466
Right. Good night, Margaret.

1251
01:23:50,884 --> 01:23:52,807
No, she isn't there.

1252
01:23:53,846 --> 01:23:55,848
What makes you say
she's been kidnapped?

1253
01:23:58,517 --> 01:24:01,487
Well, sir... I arranged it.

1254
01:24:05,023 --> 01:24:07,276
This has gone far enough.
Where is Carol?

1255
01:24:08,610 --> 01:24:11,409
Carol's being held
as a sort of hostage...

1256
01:24:11,530 --> 01:24:15,501
by some people who are very much
in earnest... as much as you are.

1257
01:24:15,617 --> 01:24:19,542
Don't be so cryptic. I haven't the
faintest idea what you're talking about.

1258
01:24:22,374 --> 01:24:24,672
I want to know
where you're hiding Van Meer.

1259
01:24:29,006 --> 01:24:32,556
(CHUCKLES) So that's it.
You've been talking with Haverstock.

1260
01:24:32,676 --> 01:24:35,930
He was here this morning telling us
about Van Meer still being alive.

1261
01:24:36,054 --> 01:24:38,225
You promised Haverstock you'd
look into it, didn't you?

1262
01:24:38,251 --> 01:24:38,832
Naturally.

1263
01:24:38,932 --> 01:24:42,937
An unusual way of looking into it,
trying to have him put out of the way.

1264
01:24:43,061 --> 01:24:46,611
I realize a life or two is a small
matter, the way you work.

1265
01:24:46,732 --> 01:24:50,703
Well, the people who have got Carol
can take a leaf out of your book.

1266
01:24:52,571 --> 01:24:54,869
Where is she?
What have you done with her?

1267
01:24:54,990 --> 01:24:57,539
Where's Van Meer?

01:25:05,209 --> 01:25:06,586
Hello?

01:25:06,710 --> 01:25:10,431
I think I can get our Dutch friend
to talk if you come along.

1271
01:25:10,589 --> 01:25:14,093

but I think it's the only way...

1272
01:25:14,218 --> 01:25:16,220
if you want to leave tomorrow.

1273
01:25:16,345 --> 01:25:19,224
When you get here,
ask at the cashier's desk...

1274
01:25:19,348 --> 01:25:21,021
to use the phone.

1275
01:25:21,141 --> 01:25:23,269
They'll show you straight up.

1276
01:25:24,436 --> 01:25:27,610
Very well.
I'll drop in as soon as I can.

1277
01:25:27,731 --> 01:25:30,735
If you want Carol, you'd better
tell me where Van Meer is.

1278
01:25:30,859 --> 01:25:32,721
Bring her back. I'll
give you the address.

1279
01:25:32,747 --> 01:25:34,479
Carol can be home
in three hours...

1280

<i>but I want that address now.</i>

1281
01:25:36,448 --> 01:25:38,701
You'll have it as soon
as Carol is home.

1282
01:25:38,825 --> 01:25:41,044
I can't possibly
wait three hours.

1283

without any evidence?

Van Meer himself proof enough?

No, and you ought to know it.

Why didn't you tell me that

- You lied to me, sir.
- My dear captain...
