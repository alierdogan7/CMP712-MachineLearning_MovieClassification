for Equikrom?

of Counterintelligence. I am all the way in.

is a message.

There's only two ways to do it.

148
00:14:34,506 --> 00:14:36,565
or you hang them by their heels
out of the window.

00:14:36,675 --> 00:14:39,974

your legs in the air you don't realize it,

-Or what? You won't be my friend anymore?

154
00:14:53,259 --> 00:14:55,557

and you're gonna get over it

155
00:14:55,661 --> 00:14:58,357

that you don't wanna work with me

156
00:14:58,430 --> 00:15:01,991
or that we've met before or that you think
someone else might do a better job,

157
00:15:02,067 --> 00:15:04,763
if I get replaced for any reason at all,

158
00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:07,100
I'm gonna call those suckers
over at Burkett & Randle

159
00:15:07,206 --> 00:15:11,768
and tell them they have an Equikrom spy
in the heart of their security team.

go down the drain, wouldn't it?

00:15:32,431 --> 00:15:36,959
-You screw this up, I'll ruin your life.
-I thought you tried that already.

164
00:15:41,907 --> 00:15:44,967
RAY: You wanna take one last shot
at that apology?

165
00:16:10,602 --> 00:16:12,160
Okay. Thank you.

166
00:16:32,524 --> 00:16:35,652
What'd she say exactly?
I mean, her exact words.

167
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:39,761
She said, "Tell Duke
this is the one he's been waiting for."

168
00:16:44,303 --> 00:16:46,635
-PAM: Do you wanna do it?
-Go ahead.

169
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:51,810
DUKE: Easy. Just...
Just, you know, pull it out.

170
00:16:52,144 --> 00:16:53,771
-Slowly. Slowly, slowly.
-Duke.

171
00:16:53,846 --> 00:16:55,609
All right, go ahead.

172
00:17:01,286 --> 00:17:04,312
Pam, Pam, easy, don't tear it.
Pam, Pam, Pam, Pam, just... Careful.

173
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:05,982
-For Christ's sake, Duke, keep your shirt on.
-Just...

174
00:17:06,091 --> 00:17:09,322
Do something useful.
Punch up Tully's fingerprints.

175
00:17:10,195 --> 00:17:12,322
Wow. Look at this.

176
00:17:13,298 --> 00:17:15,163
So is this the big one?

177
00:17:18,203 --> 00:17:20,967
-I gotta call Garsik right away.
-PAM: Yeah.

178
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:24,673
DUKE: Come on.
I need a secure line at Equikrom.

179
00:17:44,663 --> 00:17:46,995
-How are you?
-Good. How are you?

180
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:03,880
CLAIRE: Houston,
This was over the weekend,

181
00:18:03,982 --> 00:18:05,040
NED: Who are they?

182
00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:09,883
Researchers at the fragrance lab down there,
when they're not dealing ecstasy.

183
00:18:10,489 --> 00:18:11,717
Track it.

184
00:18:14,726 --> 00:18:17,524
West Coast Market Coordinator
of the Floor Wax Division.

185
00:18:17,596 --> 00:18:21,157
Came back from lunch on Friday,
handed in his resignation.

186
00:18:21,233 --> 00:18:23,030
-Unexpected?
-Very.

187
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:25,662
Three kids in private school,
he just remortgaged his house,

188
00:18:25,737 --> 00:18:27,705
-and the wife has a heart condition.
-All right.

189
00:18:27,773 --> 00:18:32,073
Well, get his financials, phone, e-mail,
and get the wife's prognosis.

190
00:18:33,912 --> 00:18:36,676
CLAlRE: Senior V.P., Medical Disposables.
He called in Sunday,

191
00:18:36,748 --> 00:18:39,376
Iost his laptop in the Denver Airport.

192
00:18:39,451 --> 00:18:40,941
Why does this guy look familiar?

193
00:18:41,053 --> 00:18:44,887
He had a briefcase
full of sales projections stolen last year.

194
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:48,384
-ls this the guy who bought the boat?
-Same guy.

195
00:18:48,927 --> 00:18:52,693
-All right. Get a team up his ass tonight.
-I sent them this morning.

(PHONE RlNGlNG)

197
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:56,595
We're in a meeting.

198
00:18:57,870 --> 00:19:00,430
Now? Everyone?

199
00:19:02,641 --> 00:19:04,541
Well, did they say why?

200
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:11,613
It's Tully. Mr. Tully's coming down.

201
00:19:11,717 --> 00:19:14,948
He wants the entire floor gathered
in five minutes.

202
00:19:49,788 --> 00:19:52,780
AIDE: Dick, it's just that you have
a very busy schedule today,

203
00:19:52,858 --> 00:19:54,155
RlCHARD: Yeah, well, something's come up.

204
00:19:54,259 --> 00:19:57,422
AlDE: There's the dandruff shampoo
marketing presentation at 3:00.

205
00:19:57,496 --> 00:19:59,930
-Cancel.
-They're in the building.

206
00:19:59,998 --> 00:20:01,022
Make it tomorrow.

207
00:20:01,133 --> 00:20:04,432
The nail polish R&D group from Germany
is at 3:45.

208
00:20:04,503 --> 00:20:05,595
Reschedule.

209
00:20:05,671 --> 00:20:07,605
You've got a premium diaper teleconference

210
00:20:07,673 --> 00:20:09,265
-at 4:15.
-Tape it.

211
00:20:09,341 --> 00:20:11,832
The nasal decongestant
rebranding numbers are in.

212
00:20:11,944 --> 00:20:14,139
-They wanted 15 minutes at around...
-Cancel!

213
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:18,047
And the toothpaste. And the car wax dinner.
Cancel it all.

214
00:20:23,488 --> 00:20:25,979
RlCHARD: All right, let's have a look at me.

215
00:20:31,163 --> 00:20:32,630
There should be another vehicle.

216
00:20:32,698 --> 00:20:34,632
Yeah. Change of plans.
You're going with them.

217
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:38,898
Everybody's going. Let's go, come on.
Get out there and sell it, folks!

218
00:20:39,004 --> 00:20:41,996
Go, go, go! Come on!
Get the hell out of here!

(TlRES SCREECHlNG)

220
00:20:49,514 --> 00:20:52,677
Get out! Leave it running.
Leave it running. I'm driving.

221
00:21:05,063 --> 00:21:06,360
DALE: This is starting to look pretty good.

222
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:08,831
DUKE: I can't even tell them apart.
Which one is the new one?

223
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:10,231
Right here.

224
00:21:11,069 --> 00:21:13,230
-This is 16.
-That's a match.

225
00:21:16,074 --> 00:21:17,769
Boris, handwriting?

226
00:21:19,244 --> 00:21:22,111
Hundred percent. It's Howard Tully.

227
00:21:22,214 --> 00:21:25,183
DUKE: All right.
Burkett & Randle, here we come!

228
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:26,342
Guys?

229
00:21:29,187 --> 00:21:32,350
RlCHARD: Duke? I'm locked out. Again.

230
00:21:34,059 --> 00:21:36,493
Yeah, I'm standing right outside.

231
00:21:37,262 --> 00:21:40,891
Of course it's me!
Who the hell else has this number?

232
00:21:40,999 --> 00:21:44,400
Yeah, okay. Duke, you know,
for all the money that I'm spending on this,

233
00:21:44,503 --> 00:21:47,233
you could've given me a code
that I can remember.

234
00:21:47,339 --> 00:21:48,363
Sir!

235
00:21:58,350 --> 00:22:00,215
What the hell is this?

236
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:09,952
Why are we here?

237
00:22:11,563 --> 00:22:14,726
We are here today
because the rules have changed,

238
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:20,902
We're here because the fabric of integrity
has been so abused and mangled

239
00:22:20,972 --> 00:22:24,066
that it is little more
than a threadbare memory,

240
00:22:25,977 --> 00:22:29,276
We're here because it's no longer enough
to have the best ideas,

241
00:22:29,381 --> 00:22:34,250
or the best manufacturing,
or the best pipeline to deliver your product.

242
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:39,823
"We're here today because we find ourselves
in a world where duplicity and theft

243
00:22:39,925 --> 00:22:44,589
"are tested daily as replacements
for innovation and perseverance."

244
00:22:44,996 --> 00:22:46,258
(LAUGHlNG)

245
00:22:47,599 --> 00:22:49,829
"Tested daily." What a bunch of crap.
Can you believe this?

246
00:22:49,935 --> 00:22:54,338
This from a guy who bought a dump
so he could go through our garbage.

247
00:22:54,439 --> 00:22:56,805
I believe the history
of all successful endeavors

248
00:22:56,908 --> 00:23:01,436
can be reduced to a series
of decisive moments,

249
00:23:02,147 --> 00:23:04,115
"There are moments in the history
of all things

250
00:23:04,182 --> 00:23:06,673
"where the placement of a single..."

251
00:23:06,785 --> 00:23:10,118
,,,where the placement of a single molecule
can make the difference

252
00:23:10,188 --> 00:23:12,679
between triumph and catastrophe,

253
00:23:12,791 --> 00:23:15,157
I mean, who the hell writes
with a fountain pen anymore?

254
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:18,093
For Christ's sake.
How fricking pretentious is that?

255
00:23:18,163 --> 00:23:20,859
This room we're in now,
this entire program,

256
00:23:20,966 --> 00:23:24,800
was created in anticipation
of just such a moment,

257
00:23:24,870 --> 00:23:28,203
You people are the very best at what you do,

258
00:23:29,408 --> 00:23:34,641
You were chosen by that standard,
You've been paid and treated accordingly,

259
00:23:35,914 --> 00:23:41,181
And you have never been tested
as you are about to be tested,

260
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:45,551
"Burkett & Randle will be rolling out
a new product

261
00:23:47,159 --> 00:23:50,560
"in the very near future."

262
00:23:50,729 --> 00:23:54,187
And while I cannot reveal
the nature of this product,

263
00:23:54,266 --> 00:23:58,600
believe me when I tell you that simply
by announcing its development,,,

264
00:23:59,271 --> 00:24:04,903
"...B&R will be dramatically repositioned
at the summit of the global marketplace."

265
00:24:05,844 --> 00:24:08,278
I don't need to explain to anybody
in this room

266
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:11,941
why the scope, the details,
the very existence of this project

267
00:24:12,050 --> 00:24:14,348
must be so carefully protected,

268
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:17,787
I expect your best in days to come,

269
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:22,750
and I promise you,
if we stay focused and vigilant,

270
00:24:23,361 --> 00:24:25,124
we will, all of us,,,

271
00:24:26,398 --> 00:24:27,865
"...prosper."

272
00:24:32,204 --> 00:24:34,866
What the hell does he have over there?

273
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:37,773
Dick? Dick? Don't go dark on me now.

274
00:24:39,211 --> 00:24:40,269
Dick!

275
00:24:42,247 --> 00:24:45,648
We gotta stay positive. Hey, look around.

276
00:24:46,318 --> 00:24:47,410
This is why we're here.

277
00:24:47,486 --> 00:24:51,115
When you came to me,
that first conversation, this is it.

278
00:24:51,223 --> 00:24:53,623
This is why we built the unit.

279
00:24:53,725 --> 00:24:56,888
-I know what he's doing.
-Dick. Dick!

280
00:24:57,662 --> 00:25:00,062
Look at me.
This is a great team we've got here.

281
00:25:00,131 --> 00:25:01,223
RlCHARD: Mmm-hmm.

282
00:25:01,299 --> 00:25:04,325
Yeah. We are so prepped.
We are so ready to deploy.

283
00:25:04,436 --> 00:25:07,496
You say the word,
you unleash the beast, Dick.

284
00:25:07,606 --> 00:25:11,007
-We will tear this thing apart.
-He's just timing the blow, Duke.

285
00:25:11,109 --> 00:25:16,069
-No. Wrong. We caught a break here.
-We caught a break? You call this a break?

286
00:25:16,982 --> 00:25:19,917
I got a shareholders' convention
in nine days.

287
00:25:19,985 --> 00:25:21,179
Hey, man, he's not thinking about that.

288
00:25:21,286 --> 00:25:22,583
Oh!

289
00:25:22,654 --> 00:25:26,784
Are you out of your fricking mind?
That is all that he thinks about.

290
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:31,352
And believe you me, if he has got a knife,
that is when he's gonna use it,

291
00:25:31,463 --> 00:25:34,364
because that's what I'd do! Yeah.

292
00:25:34,466 --> 00:25:38,493
No, I would wait till he is right in the middle
of a big old standing ovation.

293
00:25:38,603 --> 00:25:43,597
I would wait till he is just so overwhelmed
with beloved waves of adoration,

294
00:25:43,675 --> 00:25:46,200
he couldn't even hear the sound
of his own cojones

295
00:25:46,311 --> 00:25:48,506
as they hit the goddamn floor!

296
00:25:52,851 --> 00:25:54,148
(EXHALES DEEPLY)

297
00:25:58,323 --> 00:26:00,848
Oh, my God, he is gonna crush me.

298
00:26:02,994 --> 00:26:05,155
Tell your people not to make vacation plans.

299
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:07,460
-They're gonna wanna know why.
-Then they're in the wrong business.

300
00:26:07,532 --> 00:26:10,000
How are we supposed to work it up
if we don't know what we're protecting?

301
00:26:10,068 --> 00:26:13,003
Look, I don't know. Assume it's everything.

302
00:26:15,807 --> 00:26:19,004
B&R's mainframe network is a beast.

303
00:26:19,077 --> 00:26:22,569
I mean, we've spent
the last 10 months probing.

304
00:26:22,681 --> 00:26:23,875
We got nowhere.

305
00:26:23,982 --> 00:26:25,916
I mean, the encryption
and system awareness codes

306
00:26:26,017 --> 00:26:29,817
are tactically equivalent
to anything we had at the Pentagon.

307
00:26:30,922 --> 00:26:36,087
The good news is 200 photocopiers
that B&R purchased last month.

308
00:26:36,428 --> 00:26:38,225
We paid a little visit down to the vendor,

309
00:26:38,330 --> 00:26:42,426
and we made a few adjustments
to one of the units before it shipped.

310
00:26:43,702 --> 00:26:45,499
Call this the Ghost.

311
00:26:45,570 --> 00:26:48,505
It's not fast, it's not easy,
but this device right here

312
00:26:48,573 --> 00:26:50,564
allows us to hijack signal traffic

313
00:26:50,675 --> 00:26:53,667
without leaving
any electronic residue behind.

314
00:26:54,045 --> 00:27:00,075
Here. Right now we're hacking a photocopier
in their Human Resources Department.

315
00:27:00,518 --> 00:27:05,046
I mean, we're still mapping, but look,
we're tapped into 12 units already.

316
00:27:05,423 --> 00:27:07,914
PAM: The B&R Research
and Development Unit in Westchester

317
00:27:08,026 --> 00:27:11,553
hasn't brought a major new product
to market since 1997.

318
00:27:12,097 --> 00:27:15,123
In spite of that,
we made it a surveillance priority.

319
00:27:15,233 --> 00:27:17,463
Number one, we graph the volume of traffic

320
00:27:17,569 --> 00:27:19,969
and the quality of vehicles
in that parking lot.

321
00:27:20,071 --> 00:27:23,097
Number two, we track the stock portfolios
and mortgage payments

322
00:27:23,208 --> 00:27:24,436
of everybody on site.

323
00:27:24,542 --> 00:27:27,477
And, number three, we monitor
the frequency of lnternet shopping

324
00:27:27,579 --> 00:27:29,547
and pornography searches
from inside that lab.

325
00:27:29,614 --> 00:27:34,051
Stocks are down, porn is up

There's nothing going on here.

We're confident
that whatever this new product is,

328
00:27:38,923 --> 00:27:40,754
it comes from outside the company.

The moment this meeting breaks up,

330
00:27:42,293 --> 00:27:46,093
we'll be going over every acquisition
B&R has made in the past 18 months.

331
00:27:46,164 --> 00:27:47,631
We'll find it.

around this building,

but not getting anywhere.

336
00:27:59,744 --> 00:28:03,646
Then we make a big discovery.
Travel Department is not in the big building.

337
00:28:03,748 --> 00:28:09,186
Travel Department is four blocks away
and this building is very different.

-(CHUCKLES) Very simple and very basic.
-Yeah, it's a gold mine, Dick.

They basically handle
all of B&R's commercial travel,

340
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:20,920
so every private jet, car, boat, hotel,
housing, everything goes through them.

341
00:28:20,999 --> 00:28:25,026
The boys have got some great ideas
on how to get us on the inside.

00:51:26,550 --> 00:51:29,417
-They must have tried to talk you out of it.
-Not really, no.

657
00:51:29,519 --> 00:51:32,113
Well, they can't be happy to see you go.
It couldn't have been that easy.

658
00:51:32,222 --> 00:51:34,554
What are you trying to tell me?

659
00:51:36,026 --> 00:51:38,358
-You didn't do it, did you?
-Hang on.

660
00:51:38,428 --> 00:51:40,726
There's no way
that they just let you just walk out.

661
00:51:40,797 --> 00:51:43,857
-Wait.
-You just punched out? Just walked out?

662
00:51:43,934 --> 00:51:45,128
No, no, no, no, no. Hang on.

663
00:51:45,235 --> 00:51:47,135
-Answer the question.
-Did they ask you to stay?

664
00:51:47,237 --> 00:51:48,966
-You're ducking the question.
-They did, didn't they?

665
00:51:49,072 --> 00:51:51,131
-This is classic.
-They asked you to stay.

666
00:51:51,241 --> 00:51:53,266
-I know this drill, okay.
-Did you quit or not?

667
00:51:53,376 --> 00:51:55,071
Deny everything. Admit nothing.

668
00:51:55,145 --> 00:51:57,306
-Make counter-accusations.
-That's what you're doing.

669
00:51:57,414 --> 00:51:59,541
I asked you how it went and you evaded!

670
00:51:59,616 --> 00:52:03,484
How it went?
I just terminated a 12-year career with Ml6.

671
00:52:03,587 --> 00:52:05,282
I spent an hour
signing non-disclosure forms,

672
00:52:05,388 --> 00:52:07,652
I did a quick outplacement polygraph,
I turned in my credentials

673
00:52:07,757 --> 00:52:09,588
and I walked out
on the only job I've ever really had,

674
00:52:09,659 --> 00:52:12,560
and now, right now,
I'm getting the very distinct impression

675
00:52:12,629 --> 00:52:17,089
that you changed your mind,
kept your job, and left me out in the cold.

676
00:52:17,934 --> 00:52:19,561
They kind of begged me to stay.

677
00:52:19,636 --> 00:52:22,799
And you don't call
to tell me that this morning?

678
00:52:22,906 --> 00:52:24,635
I couldn't risk it.

679
00:52:24,741 --> 00:52:27,005
You're unbelievable.

680
00:52:27,110 --> 00:52:30,443
-I was completely surprised.
-I don't believe this.

681
00:52:31,581 --> 00:52:33,913
I hope you kept your passports.

682
00:52:33,984 --> 00:52:35,679
What am I supposed to do? I can't go back.

683
00:52:35,785 --> 00:52:37,844
You have to turn in a couple
to make it look good, but...

684
00:52:37,954 --> 00:52:39,444
I am totally cooked.

685
00:52:39,523 --> 00:52:41,821
...we're gonna need decent passports.

686
00:52:41,925 --> 00:52:44,086
What are you talking about?

687
00:52:44,794 --> 00:52:47,592
I took everything I could get my hands on.

688
00:52:47,664 --> 00:52:49,529
After they begged me.

689
00:52:52,435 --> 00:52:53,834
You bitch.

690
00:53:01,611 --> 00:53:04,546
(WHlSPERS) Admit it.
You don't trust me, either.

691
00:53:25,368 --> 00:53:27,336
So, the total footprint.

692
00:53:27,404 --> 00:53:31,363
That's if you're interested in both buildings,
'cause they're both available right now.

693
00:53:31,474 --> 00:53:36,502
It's about 22,000 square feet.
The ventilation, it's zoned.

694
00:53:36,580 --> 00:53:42,018
And you've got separate filtration systems
for the lab, office, storage and loading.

695
00:53:42,085 --> 00:53:44,747
-It's lovely and clean.
-Yes, indeed.

696
00:53:44,854 --> 00:53:48,051
The last tenants left the place
in terrific shape. It's just spotless.

697
00:53:48,158 --> 00:53:49,716
What kind of business were they in?

698
00:53:49,826 --> 00:53:54,229
REALTOR: Formavale? Damned if I know.
Some kind of biotech.

699
00:53:54,331 --> 00:53:57,357
They took the place, loaded in their gear
and that's about the last we saw of them.

700
00:53:57,434 --> 00:54:00,528
Hell, they used to truck out their own trash.

701
00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:06,705
Cronin Partiz. Ronnie Partiz.

702
00:54:06,776 --> 00:54:09,244
Dr. Ronald Partiz.

703
00:54:09,346 --> 00:54:11,906
This is 10 years ago up in Albany.

704
00:54:12,449 --> 00:54:16,078
He's graduating high school,
15 years old in that picture,

705
00:54:16,186 --> 00:54:18,017
but he's a smart kid.

706
00:54:18,088 --> 00:54:20,352
He gets a free ride to Cornell.

707
00:54:20,423 --> 00:54:22,516
He finds his way
into the biochemistry department.

708
00:54:22,592 --> 00:54:24,150
Two years later, he's in med school.

709
00:54:24,394 --> 00:54:26,954
PAM: He's 18, he's doing research
with some heavy hitters,

710
00:54:27,063 --> 00:54:29,930
he's getting good evaluations,
he's rolling along,

711
00:54:30,033 --> 00:54:35,232
1999, he publishes an article in a magazine
called American Dermatologist,

712
00:54:35,305 --> 00:54:38,035
-About?
-Something about a fungus.

713
00:54:38,775 --> 00:54:40,242
What kind of fungus?

714
00:54:40,310 --> 00:54:41,470
DUKE: It doesn't matter,

715
00:54:41,578 --> 00:54:43,239
RICHARD: Doesn't matter?
Everything matters,

716
00:54:43,313 --> 00:54:47,147
He plagiarized it. He stole it.
He got caught immediately.

717
00:54:47,784 --> 00:54:51,220
PAM: They bounced him out of Cornell,
He set up shop in his parents' garage,

718
00:54:51,288 --> 00:54:54,382
started working on some kind of skin cream,

719
00:54:54,457 --> 00:54:56,084
DUKE: Yeah, something called...

720
00:54:56,159 --> 00:54:57,592
-What?
-PAM: Spring Skin.

721
00:54:57,661 --> 00:55:00,596
He tried to sell it to health food stores
in the area up there.

722
00:55:00,664 --> 00:55:03,428
Now, you're sure this is a cream
or was it a lotion?

723
00:55:03,500 --> 00:55:06,628
-Because a lot of people confuse the two.
-I don't know.

724
00:55:06,736 --> 00:55:11,469
Well, for Christ's sake, Duke, let's have that!
Let's have that! I mean, if...

725
00:55:11,574 --> 00:55:14,941
If there is even a chance that this guy
is Tully's secret weapon,

726
00:55:15,011 --> 00:55:17,912
we're gonna need a hell of a lot more
than his goddamn grade point average!

727
00:55:17,981 --> 00:55:21,473
You gotta get me his cream!
Show me the cream!

728
00:55:21,584 --> 00:55:25,315
Dick, he went bankrupt overnight.
It was a bust, okay.

729
00:55:25,422 --> 00:55:29,188
We don't think the cream
is the answer here,

730
00:55:29,292 --> 00:55:32,261
So, Ronnie Partiz
now goes deep underground,
