4
00:01:58,470 --> 00:02:00,771
My name

5
00:02:00,806 --> 00:02:03,441
is Grey Worm.

6
00:02:05,110 --> 00:02:07,111
I come from

7
00:02:07,145 --> 00:02:10,181
the Summer "Ills."

8
00:02:10,215 --> 00:02:11,982
Isles.

9
00:02:12,017 --> 00:02:15,119
Summer Isles.

10
00:02:15,153 --> 00:02:18,355
Grey Worm:
<i>Summer Isles.</i>

11
00:02:20,058 --> 00:02:22,126
( speaking Valyrian )

12
00:02:25,630 --> 00:02:28,666
I am from an island
called Naath.

13
00:02:30,569 --> 00:02:33,237
When they took you?

14
00:02:33,271 --> 00:02:36,474
<i>"When</i> did <i>they take me?"</i>

15
00:02:39,444 --> 00:02:41,745
I was five years old.

16
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:43,914
You remember your home?

17
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:48,219
I remember when they
rowed us away from shore.

18
00:02:49,688 --> 00:02:53,757
How white
the beaches were.

19
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:57,428
How tall the trees.

20
00:02:59,664 --> 00:03:03,634
And I remember
my village burning.

21
00:03:03,668 --> 00:03:07,171
Smoke rising
into the sky.

22
00:03:14,946 --> 00:03:16,814
Do you remember your home?

23
00:03:18,416 --> 00:03:20,050
Unsullied.

24
00:03:20,085 --> 00:03:22,620
Always Unsullied.

25
00:03:22,654 --> 00:03:25,990
Before Unsullied,
nothing.

26
00:03:26,024 --> 00:03:28,259
That's not true.

27
00:03:30,228 --> 00:03:32,963
Perhaps one day you will return
to the Summer Isles.

28
00:03:32,998 --> 00:03:34,798
I don't want return.

29
00:03:34,833 --> 00:03:37,902
( speaking Valyrian )

30
00:03:40,105 --> 00:03:41,672
Kill the masters.

31
00:03:41,706 --> 00:03:44,275
Kill the masters.

32
00:03:46,177 --> 00:03:47,811
Daenerys:
<i>How are the lessons coming?</i>

33
00:03:47,846 --> 00:03:50,781
Very well,
Your Grace.

34
00:03:50,815 --> 00:03:54,218
Missandei is teacher
good, my queen.

35
00:03:57,122 --> 00:03:59,056
You'll have
to continue later.

36
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:03,027
It's time.

37
00:04:36,161 --> 00:04:38,562
( grunting )

38
00:05:12,263 --> 00:05:13,797
( speaking Valyrian )

39
00:07:19,157 --> 00:07:22,259
( speaks Valyrian )

40
00:07:24,162 --> 00:07:26,296
( speaks Valyrian )

41
00:07:39,444 --> 00:07:41,345
( gasps )

42
00:07:44,482 --> 00:07:46,650
( slaves shouting )

43
00:07:49,754 --> 00:07:51,588
( screaming )

44
00:07:51,623 --> 00:07:55,325
( slaves shouting )
Mhysa! Mhysa! Mhysa!

45
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:59,229
Mhysa! Mhysa!
Mhysa! Mhysa!

46
00:07:59,264 --> 00:08:01,698
( shouting continues )

47
00:08:33,698 --> 00:08:36,733
( shouting continues )
Mhysa! Mhysa!

48
00:08:41,706 --> 00:08:43,473
Daenerys:
<i>Remind me, Ser Jorah,</i>

49
00:08:43,508 --> 00:08:47,010
<i>how many children did the</i>
<i>Great Masters nail to mileposts?</i>

50
00:08:47,045 --> 00:08:50,347
163, Khaleesi.

51
00:08:50,381 --> 00:08:52,382
Yes, that was it.

52
00:08:58,656 --> 00:09:00,791
( shouts in Valyrian )

53
00:09:00,825 --> 00:09:03,694
Barristan: <i>Your Grace,</i>
<i>may I have a word?</i>

54
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:10,567
The city is yours.

55
00:09:10,602 --> 00:09:13,403
<i>All these people,</i>
<i>they're your subjects now.</i>

56
00:09:14,639 --> 00:09:17,140
Sometimes it is better
to answer injustice

57
00:09:17,175 --> 00:09:18,976
with mercy.

58
00:09:19,010 --> 00:09:23,146
I will answer injustice
with justice.

59
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:31,822
( screaming )

60
00:09:33,625 --> 00:09:36,026
( screaming )

61
00:09:47,538 --> 00:09:50,073
( screaming continues )

62
00:09:50,975 --> 00:09:54,244
<i>( screams echoing )</i>

63
00:10:13,431 --> 00:10:16,133
( panting )

64
00:10:38,723 --> 00:10:40,657
( grunts )

65
00:10:41,826 --> 00:10:43,627
What the hell was that?

66
00:10:43,661 --> 00:10:47,130
That was me knocking your ass
to the dirt

67
00:10:47,165 --> 00:10:48,865
with your own hand.

68
00:10:51,803 --> 00:10:52,970
You're a rare talent.

69
00:10:53,004 --> 00:10:56,239
When you're fighting
cripples, anyway.

70
00:10:57,675 --> 00:10:59,776
You learned to fight
like a good little boy.

71
00:10:59,811 --> 00:11:01,643
I'll bet that thrust
through the Mad King's back

72
00:11:01,668 --> 00:11:02,879
was pretty as a picture.

73
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:05,248
<i>You want to fight pretty</i>
<i>or you want to win?</i>

74
00:11:05,283 --> 00:11:07,084
You talk to my brother
this way?

75
00:11:07,118 --> 00:11:08,652
All the time.

76
00:11:08,686 --> 00:11:11,021
He got used to it.

77
00:11:18,463 --> 00:11:20,931
Do you think
he did it?

78
00:11:20,965 --> 00:11:23,033
No.

79
00:11:23,067 --> 00:11:25,569
Oh, he hated
the little twat, sure.

80
00:11:25,603 --> 00:11:27,604
But who didn't?

81
00:11:28,573 --> 00:11:30,640
And poison's
not his style.

82
00:11:31,609 --> 00:11:34,077
Or murder,
for that matter.

83
00:11:35,446 --> 00:11:37,814
You want to know for sure,
why don't you ask him?

84
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:44,321
You haven't been
to see him yet, eh?

85
00:11:45,423 --> 00:11:47,257
We're done for today.

86
00:11:47,325 --> 00:11:50,427
<i>( seagulls calling )</i>

87
00:11:50,461 --> 00:11:52,462
Your brother ever tell you
how I came into his service?

88
00:11:52,497 --> 00:11:55,665
You stood for him in his trial
by combat at the Eyrie.

89
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:57,834
Aye.

90
00:11:57,869 --> 00:11:59,870
But only when
Lady Arryn demanded

91
00:11:59,904 --> 00:12:02,539
the trial take place
that day.

92
00:12:02,573 --> 00:12:04,708
You were his first choice.

93
00:12:04,742 --> 00:12:07,144
He named you
for his champion

94
00:12:07,178 --> 00:12:09,272
because he knew you
would ride day and night

95
00:12:09,297 --> 00:12:11,297
to come fight for him.

96
00:12:12,383 --> 00:12:14,251
You gonna fight
for him now?

97
00:12:22,326 --> 00:12:24,928
To tell you the truth,
this isn't so bad.

98
00:12:24,962 --> 00:12:28,031
Four walls.
A pot to piss in.

99
00:12:28,066 --> 00:12:30,834
I was chained
to a wooden post

100
00:12:30,868 --> 00:12:33,470
covered in my own
shit for months.

101
00:12:36,407 --> 00:12:39,042
Is that supposed
to make me feel better?

102
00:12:39,077 --> 00:12:40,811
Maybe a bit.

103
00:12:43,681 --> 00:12:45,549
I'm sorry I didn't
come sooner.

104
00:12:45,583 --> 00:12:48,418
It's complicated, yes.

105
00:12:49,654 --> 00:12:52,422
- So how is our sister?
- How do you think?

106
00:12:52,457 --> 00:12:55,058
Her son died in her arms.

107
00:12:55,093 --> 00:12:57,661
Her son?

108
00:12:57,695 --> 00:13:00,063
Don't.

109
00:13:04,635 --> 00:13:06,837
You know what's coming?

110
00:13:06,871 --> 00:13:09,673
My trial for regicide.
Yes, I know.

111
00:13:11,042 --> 00:13:14,744
I know the whole bloody
country thinks I'm guilty.

112
00:13:14,779 --> 00:13:16,947
I know that one
of my three judges

113
00:13:16,981 --> 00:13:19,216
has wished me dead more
times than I can count.

114
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:21,751
And that judge
is my father.

115
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:24,354
As for Cersei,

116
00:13:24,388 --> 00:13:26,356
well, she's probably
working on a way

117
00:13:26,424 --> 00:13:29,226
to avoid a trial altogether
by having me killed.

118
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:32,696
Now that you mention it,
she did ask.

119
00:13:32,730 --> 00:13:35,599
So, should I turn around
and close my eyes?

120
00:13:35,666 --> 00:13:37,767
Depends.

121
00:13:37,802 --> 00:13:40,003
Did you do it?

122
00:13:40,037 --> 00:13:41,771
The Kingslayer brothers.

123
00:13:41,806 --> 00:13:45,208
You like it?
I like it.

124
00:13:46,944 --> 00:13:49,679
You're really asking
if I killed your son?

125
00:13:49,714 --> 00:13:53,250
Are you really asking
if I'd kill my brother?

126
00:13:56,954 --> 00:13:58,688
How can I help you?

127
00:13:59,790 --> 00:14:01,258
Well, you could
set me free.

128
00:14:02,493 --> 00:14:04,427
You know I can't.

129
00:14:04,462 --> 00:14:07,497
Then there's really
nothing else to say.

130
00:14:07,532 --> 00:14:09,900
What do you want me to do?
Kill the guards?

131
00:14:09,967 --> 00:14:11,401
Sneak you out of the city
in the back of a cart?

132
00:14:11,435 --> 00:14:13,370
I'm the Lord Commander
of the Kingsguard.

133
00:14:13,404 --> 00:14:15,172
Sorry, I'd forgotten.

134
00:14:15,206 --> 00:14:17,307
I'd hate for you to do
something inappropriate.

135
00:14:17,341 --> 00:14:18,808
Inappropriate?

136
00:14:18,843 --> 00:14:21,811
You're accused of killing the king.
Freeing you is treason.

137
00:14:21,846 --> 00:14:23,747
Except I didn't do it.

138
00:14:23,781 --> 00:14:25,782
Which is why
we're having a trial.

139
00:14:25,816 --> 00:14:28,118
A trial.

140
00:14:28,152 --> 00:14:30,887
If the killer threw himself
before the Iron Throne,

141
00:14:30,922 --> 00:14:32,460
confessed to his crimes,

142
00:14:32,485 --> 00:14:34,919
and gave irrefutable
evidence of his guilt,

143
00:14:35,259 --> 00:14:36,693
<i>it wouldn't matter</i>
<i>to Cersei.</i>

144
00:14:36,727 --> 00:14:39,729
She won't rest
until my head's on a spike.

145
00:14:39,764 --> 00:14:41,898
Not just yours.

146
00:14:41,933 --> 00:14:45,302
She's offering a knighthood
to whomever finds Sansa Stark.

147
00:14:45,336 --> 00:14:46,937
Sansa couldn't
have done this.

148
00:14:46,971 --> 00:14:49,194
She had more reason than
anyone in the Seven Kingdoms.

149
00:14:49,195 --> 00:14:50,470
Do you think it's a coincidence

150
00:14:50,495 --> 00:14:52,309
she disappeared the same
night Joffrey died?

151
00:14:52,310 --> 00:14:54,578
No, but...

152
00:14:55,613 --> 00:14:57,814
Sansa's not a killer.

153
00:15:00,117 --> 00:15:01,484
Not yet, anyway.

154
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:05,055
- <i>( wood creaking )</i>
- <i>( men shouting )</i>

155
00:15:07,758 --> 00:15:10,260
<i>( footsteps approaching )</i>

156
00:15:14,932 --> 00:15:17,000
Where are you taking me?

157
00:15:17,034 --> 00:15:19,202
I'm getting married
to your Aunt Lysa.

158
00:15:19,237 --> 00:15:21,471
She's waiting for us
at the Eyrie.

159
00:15:21,505 --> 00:15:24,274
You'll be safe there.

160
00:15:36,387 --> 00:15:38,088
Did you kill Joffrey?

161
00:15:38,122 --> 00:15:41,291
Did I kill Joffrey?

162
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:44,594
I've been in
the Vale for weeks.

163
00:15:44,629 --> 00:15:45,795
I know it was you.

164
00:15:45,830 --> 00:15:49,766
And who helped me
with this conspiracy?

165
00:15:51,869 --> 00:15:53,670
Well, there was Ser Dontos.

166
00:15:53,704 --> 00:15:55,905
You used him to get
me out of King's Landing,

167
00:15:55,940 --> 00:15:58,541
but you would never trust
him to kill the king.

168
00:15:58,643 --> 00:15:59,601
Why not?

169
00:15:59,626 --> 00:16:01,824
Because you're too smart
to trust a drunk.

170
00:16:02,246 --> 00:16:04,781
Then perhaps it was
your husband.

171
00:16:04,815 --> 00:16:06,349
No.

172
00:16:06,384 --> 00:16:08,118
<i>How do you know?</i>

173
00:16:08,152 --> 00:16:10,787
I just do.

174
00:16:10,821 --> 00:16:12,956
You're right.

175
00:16:12,990 --> 00:16:15,458
He wasn't involved
in Joffrey's death.

176
00:16:15,493 --> 00:16:17,527
But you were.

177
00:16:18,963 --> 00:16:22,265
<i>Do you remember that lovely</i>
<i>necklace Dontos gave you?</i>

178
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:26,469
<i>I don't suppose you noticed</i>
<i>that a stone was missing</i>

179
00:16:26,537 --> 00:16:28,772
<i>after the feast.</i>

180
00:16:28,806 --> 00:16:31,341
The poison.

181
00:16:33,177 --> 00:16:35,378
I don't understand.

182
00:16:35,413 --> 00:16:37,981
The Lannisters gave you
wealth, power.

183
00:16:38,015 --> 00:16:39,816
Joffrey made you
the Lord of Harrenhal.

184
00:16:39,850 --> 00:16:42,719
A man with no motive
is a man no one suspects.

185
00:16:42,753 --> 00:16:45,422
<i>Always keep</i>
<i>your foes confused.</i>

186
00:16:45,456 --> 00:16:48,358
If they don't know who
you are or what you want,

187
00:16:48,392 --> 00:16:51,494
they can't know
what you plan to do next.

188
00:16:54,465 --> 00:16:56,433
I don't believe you.

189
00:16:58,202 --> 00:17:00,603
<i>If they catch you,</i>
<i>they'll put your head on a spike</i>

190
00:17:00,638 --> 00:17:02,005
<i>just like my father's.</i>

191
00:17:02,039 --> 00:17:05,241
You'd risk that
just to confuse them?

192
00:17:06,844 --> 00:17:10,380
So many men,
they risk so little.

193
00:17:10,414 --> 00:17:13,416
They spend their lives
avoiding danger.

194
00:17:13,451 --> 00:17:15,852
And then they die.

195
00:17:17,154 --> 00:17:20,957
I'd risk everything
to get what I want.

196
00:17:20,991 --> 00:17:24,127
And what do you want?

197
00:17:30,067 --> 00:17:31,668
Everything.

198
00:17:33,504 --> 00:17:36,840
My friendship with the Lannisters
was productive.

199
00:17:36,874 --> 00:17:39,576
But Joffrey,

200
00:17:39,610 --> 00:17:42,145
a vicious boy with
a crown on his head,

201
00:17:42,179 --> 00:17:44,447
is not a reliable ally.

202
00:17:44,482 --> 00:17:46,449
And who could trust
a friend like that?

203
00:17:46,484 --> 00:17:48,718
Who could trust you?

204
00:17:49,987 --> 00:17:52,288
I don't want
friends like me.

205
00:17:52,323 --> 00:17:54,791
My new friends
are predictable.

206
00:17:54,825 --> 00:17:56,326
Very reasonable people.

207
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:59,062
<i>As for what</i>
<i>happened to Joffrey,</i>

208
00:17:59,096 --> 00:18:03,400
well, that was something
my new friends wanted very badly.

209
00:18:03,434 --> 00:18:05,902
<i>Nothing like</i>
<i>a thoughtful gift</i>

210
00:18:05,970 --> 00:18:08,538
<i>to make a new friendship</i>
<i>grow strong.</i>

211
00:18:08,572 --> 00:18:10,473
I can't believe
you're going.

212
00:18:10,508 --> 00:18:13,109
Leaving me alone here
with these people.

213
00:18:13,144 --> 00:18:15,478
<i>The time has come,</i>
<i>my dear.</i>

214
00:18:15,513 --> 00:18:18,548
There's nothing
more tedious than a trial.

215
00:18:18,582 --> 00:18:21,050
Except perhaps
these gardens.

216
00:18:21,085 --> 00:18:23,820
If I have to take one
more leisurely stroll

217
00:18:23,854 --> 00:18:27,056
through these gardens,
I'll fling myself from the cliffs.

218
00:18:27,091 --> 00:18:28,591
( Margaery laughs )

219
00:18:28,626 --> 00:18:30,593
Have you been
to see Tommen yet?

220
00:18:30,628 --> 00:18:32,595
No.

221
00:18:32,630 --> 00:18:34,564
Have they even agreed
to the match?

222
00:18:34,598 --> 00:18:36,332
No one tells me anything.

223
00:18:36,367 --> 00:18:37,622
I wasn't originally meant

224
00:18:37,647 --> 00:18:39,802
to marry your grandfather
Luthor, you know.

225
00:18:40,604 --> 00:18:42,972
He was engaged
to my sister,

226
00:18:43,007 --> 00:18:45,175
your great-aunt Viola.

227
00:18:45,209 --> 00:18:48,445
I was to be given
to some Targaryen or other.

228
00:18:48,479 --> 00:18:52,215
Marrying a Targaryen
was all the rage back then.

229
00:18:52,249 --> 00:18:54,784
But the moment
I saw my intended,

230
00:18:54,819 --> 00:18:58,188
with his twitchy
little ferret's face

231
00:18:58,222 --> 00:19:00,156
and ludicrous silver hair,

232
00:19:00,191 --> 00:19:02,225
I knew he wouldn't do.

233
00:19:02,259 --> 00:19:04,794
So the evening

234
00:19:04,829 --> 00:19:07,897
before Luthor was
to propose to my sister,

235
00:19:07,932 --> 00:19:10,600
I got lost on my way back
from my embroidery lesson

236
00:19:10,634 --> 00:19:12,936
and happened
upon his chamber.

237
00:19:12,970 --> 00:19:14,170
( laughs )

238
00:19:14,205 --> 00:19:16,539
- How absentminded of me.
- Mm-hmm.

239
00:19:16,574 --> 00:19:20,743
The following morning,
Luthor never made it down the stairs

240
00:19:20,778 --> 00:19:24,514
to propose to my sister
'cause the boy couldn't bloody walk.

241
00:19:24,548 --> 00:19:26,850
And once he could,
the only thing he wanted

242
00:19:26,884 --> 00:19:29,285
was what I'd given him
the night before.

243
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:31,488
I was good.

244
00:19:31,522 --> 00:19:34,224
I was very, very good.

245
00:19:36,026 --> 00:19:38,661
You are even better.

246
00:19:38,729 --> 00:19:40,296
But you need
to act quickly.

247
00:19:40,331 --> 00:19:44,167
Cersei may be vicious,
but she's not stupid.

248
00:19:44,201 --> 00:19:47,103
She'll turn the boy
against you as soon as she can.

249
00:19:47,137 --> 00:19:50,440
And by the time you're married,
it'll be too late.

250
00:19:50,474 --> 00:19:52,442
Luckily for you,
the Queen Regent

251
00:19:52,476 --> 00:19:54,310
is rather distracted
at the moment.

252
00:19:54,345 --> 00:19:56,779
mourning her dear
departed boy.

253
00:19:56,814 --> 00:19:59,182
Accusing her brother
of his murder,

254
00:19:59,216 --> 00:20:01,184
which he didn't commit.

255
00:20:01,218 --> 00:20:02,352
Well, he could have done.

256
00:20:02,386 --> 00:20:04,320
He could have done,
but he didn't.

257
00:20:04,355 --> 00:20:07,357
- You don't know, Grandmother.
- But I do know.

258
00:20:07,391 --> 00:20:11,961
You don't think I'd let you
marry that beast, do you?

259
00:20:13,030 --> 00:20:16,065
What?
I don't understand.

260
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:19,702
Shh. Don't you worry
yourself about all that.

261
00:20:22,006 --> 00:20:24,374
You just do
what needs to be done.

262
00:20:25,843 --> 00:20:27,844
Jon:
<i>Bring it through!</i>

263
00:20:27,878 --> 00:20:30,880
( swords clanging )

264
00:20:35,185 --> 00:20:37,487
And again.

265
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:46,729
- ( laughs )
- Very nice. Good.

266
00:20:46,764 --> 00:20:49,432
A lot of wildlings fight
with a weapon in each hand.

267
00:20:49,466 --> 00:20:52,468
First thing you want to do

268
00:20:52,536 --> 00:20:55,271
is disarm them to try
and even the odds.

269
00:21:08,986 --> 00:21:10,720
Let's see what you can do.

270
00:21:12,623 --> 00:21:14,424
Olly, you just watch
for now.

271
00:21:14,458 --> 00:21:15,525
I can fight.

272
00:21:15,559 --> 00:21:17,627
Have you ever
held a sword before?

273
00:21:17,661 --> 00:21:19,696
I was the best archer
in our hamlet.

274
00:21:19,730 --> 00:21:22,131
- ( men laugh )
- I was!

275
00:21:22,166 --> 00:21:24,467
I believe you.

276
00:21:24,501 --> 00:21:26,135
We'll go hunting
for rabbits one day.

277
00:21:26,203 --> 00:21:27,870
Rit now,
watch and learn.

278
00:21:30,174 --> 00:21:32,141
You two.

279
00:21:32,176 --> 00:21:35,278
Take it slow,
try and disarm each other.

280
00:21:43,187 --> 00:21:45,388
( shouts )

281
00:21:47,491 --> 00:21:49,459
( groans )

282
00:22:01,071 --> 00:22:02,805
You know how to fight.

283
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:05,308
You could have gone
easier on him.

284
00:22:05,342 --> 00:22:07,777
He wouldn't have learned
anything that way.

285
00:22:10,814 --> 00:22:13,282
Alliser: <i>What do you think</i>
<i>you're doing?</i>

286
00:22:13,317 --> 00:22:15,952
Grenn and I were
helping them.

287
00:22:15,986 --> 00:22:18,087
Grenn's a ranger.
You're a steward.

288
00:22:18,122 --> 00:22:21,224
Maybe you forgot that while you
were off with your wildling bitch,

289
00:22:21,258 --> 00:22:23,226
but I didn't.

290
00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:25,595
Someone has
to train them.

291
00:22:25,629 --> 00:22:27,497
And that someone
isn't you.

292
00:22:27,531 --> 00:22:29,866
Go find a chamber pot
to empty.

293
00:22:32,436 --> 00:22:35,171
Go on. Do it.

294
00:22:35,205 --> 00:22:37,206
You traitor's bastard.

295
00:22:37,241 --> 00:22:39,175
Give me an excuse.

296
00:22:39,209 --> 00:22:42,111
Mormont's not here
to protect you now.

297
00:22:53,090 --> 00:22:55,525
Get back to work.

298
00:22:55,559 --> 00:22:57,960
Now!

299
00:22:57,995 --> 00:23:00,530
I said now!

300
00:23:03,667 --> 00:23:06,769
The bastard's well-liked.
You're not.

301
00:23:06,804 --> 00:23:09,372
You think I care if they like me?
We're at war.

302
00:23:09,406 --> 00:23:10,940
For now.

303
00:23:11,008 --> 00:23:13,176
But you can't be
acting commander forever.

304
00:23:13,210 --> 00:23:15,344
There will be a choosing.

305
00:23:15,379 --> 00:23:17,313
The old maester
will insist on it.

306
00:23:17,347 --> 00:23:19,816
You might reconsider

307
00:23:19,850 --> 00:23:22,585
his request to march
on Craster's.

308
00:23:22,619 --> 00:23:26,222
Let the mutineers
take care of Snow.

309
00:23:26,256 --> 00:23:28,658
Or you might be taking
orders from him

310
00:23:28,692 --> 00:23:30,259
the rest of your life.

311
00:23:45,809 --> 00:23:47,276
A bastard, eh?

312
00:23:47,311 --> 00:23:50,046
Took you for highborn.

313
00:23:51,448 --> 00:23:53,416
My father was highborn.

314
00:23:53,450 --> 00:23:56,119
My mother wasn't.

315
00:23:58,288 --> 00:24:00,189
Name's Locke.

316
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:04,026
Jon Snow.

317
00:24:07,498 --> 00:24:08,931
You fight well.

318
00:24:08,966 --> 00:24:10,666
What brought you up here?

319
00:24:10,701 --> 00:24:12,802
A sense of duty.

320
00:24:12,836 --> 00:24:16,105
I wanted to do my part
for the safety of the realm.

321
00:24:16,974 --> 00:24:18,775
( laughs )

322
00:24:18,809 --> 00:24:21,377
I was a game warden
in the Stormlands.

323
00:24:21,411 --> 00:24:24,013
Fed a prized partridge
to my hungry kids.

324
00:24:24,047 --> 00:24:25,848
I was stupid enough
to get caught.

325
00:24:25,916 --> 00:24:28,017
Chose the Wall
over losing my hand.

326
00:24:28,051 --> 00:24:31,754
Figured I wouldn't have to suck up
to any highborn cunts here.

327
00:24:31,789 --> 00:24:34,023
Alliser:
<i>Come on, get on with it.</i>

328
00:24:34,057 --> 00:24:35,792
What are you
waiting for? Summer?

329
00:24:35,826 --> 00:24:37,293
Guess I was wrong.

330
00:24:39,463 --> 00:24:41,798
<i>( knocking )</i>

331
00:24:44,034 --> 00:24:45,968
<i>( knocking )</i>

332
00:24:48,038 --> 00:24:50,306
<i>( knocking )</i>

333
00:24:57,481 --> 00:24:59,582
You sent for me,
Your Grace?

334
00:24:59,616 --> 00:25:01,551
Your Grace.

335
00:25:01,585 --> 00:25:03,386
How formal of you.

336
00:25:05,289 --> 00:25:08,524
How many Kingsguards
are posted outside Tommen's door?

337
00:25:08,559 --> 00:25:11,961
Ser Boros
is on duty tonight.

338
00:25:11,995 --> 00:25:14,330
- Tomorrow I believe--
- <i>So one?</i>

339
00:25:15,599 --> 00:25:18,501
You have one man
guarding the future king?

340
00:25:18,535 --> 00:25:20,603
I promise you
Tommen's safe.

341
00:25:20,637 --> 00:25:21,871
We're protecting him.

342
00:25:21,905 --> 00:25:25,041
The way you
protected Joffrey?

343
00:25:26,376 --> 00:25:28,911
Why did Catelyn Stark
set you free?

344
00:25:28,979 --> 00:25:31,614
- What?
- I've been wondering for months.

345
00:25:31,648 --> 00:25:35,418
Ever since that great cow brought
you back to the capital.

346
00:25:36,386 --> 00:25:38,087
Why did she
set you free?

347
00:25:38,121 --> 00:25:39,184
You know why.

348
00:25:39,209 --> 00:25:41,181
She'd hoped I'd send
her daughters back to her.

349
00:25:46,129 --> 00:25:48,064
She hoped
or did you promise?

350
00:25:48,098 --> 00:25:49,932
I swore by all the gods

351
00:25:49,967 --> 00:25:52,435
that if her daughters were alive,
I'd return them to her.

352
00:25:52,502 --> 00:25:54,370
So you made a sacred vow
to the enemy.

353
00:25:54,404 --> 00:25:57,106
I wanted to get
back to you.

354
00:25:58,208 --> 00:25:59,909
Should I have told her
to fuck off?

355
00:25:59,943 --> 00:26:01,844
You didn't mean it, then?

356
00:26:01,879 --> 00:26:04,881
You have no loyalty
to Catelyn Stark?

357
00:26:04,915 --> 00:26:06,782
Catelyn Stark's dead.

358
00:26:06,817 --> 00:26:09,085
So if I told you to leave the capital
right now and find Sansa,

359
00:26:09,119 --> 00:26:13,256
if I told you to find that
murderous little bitch

360
00:26:13,323 --> 00:26:15,324
and bring me her head,

361
00:26:15,359 --> 00:26:17,593
would you do it?

362
00:26:22,099 --> 00:26:24,367
I know you went
to see Tyrion.

363
00:26:26,737 --> 00:26:30,539
That creature
who murdered our son.

364
00:26:32,776 --> 00:26:35,011
I had to see him.

365
00:26:35,045 --> 00:26:36,545
I had to know
for myself.

366
00:26:36,580 --> 00:26:38,581
And?

367
00:26:40,183 --> 00:26:42,785
He didn't do it, Cersei.

368
00:26:42,819 --> 00:26:45,288
You've always pitied him.

369
00:26:45,322 --> 00:26:48,658
Our poor little brother.

370
00:26:48,692 --> 00:26:50,459
Abused by the world.

371
00:26:50,494 --> 00:26:52,461
Despised by his father
and sister.

372
00:26:52,496 --> 00:26:55,364
He'd kill us all
if he could.

373
00:26:58,201 --> 00:27:01,537
I want four men
at Tommen's door day and night.

374
00:27:03,206 --> 00:27:05,775
That will be all,
Lord Commander.

375
00:27:33,370 --> 00:27:35,304
( sighs )

376
00:27:38,475 --> 00:27:40,343
<i>( door opens )</i>

377
00:27:40,377 --> 00:27:42,445
Ser Pounce?

378
00:27:45,515 --> 00:27:48,184
<i>( door creaks )</i>

379
00:27:49,553 --> 00:27:51,654
<i>( door closes )</i>

380
00:27:56,393 --> 00:27:58,594
How did you get past
the Kingsguard?

381
00:27:58,628 --> 00:28:01,263
Kingsguard.

382
00:28:02,632 --> 00:28:05,835
I don't think you're
supposed to be here.

383
00:28:05,869 --> 00:28:08,871
Mother doesn't allow me
to have visitors at night.

384
00:28:08,905 --> 00:28:11,440
I'm not a visitor,
Your Grace.

385
00:28:11,475 --> 00:28:14,710
Word has it
I'm to be your bride.

386
00:28:19,816 --> 00:28:22,184
Did you know that people
in arranged marriages

387
00:28:22,219 --> 00:28:25,254
often never meet
until their wedding day?

388
00:28:27,958 --> 00:28:31,594
Before we decide to spend
our lives together,

389
00:28:31,628 --> 00:28:33,829
we ought to get
to know one another.

390
00:28:33,864 --> 00:28:36,032
Don't you think?

391
00:28:37,534 --> 00:28:39,402
Yes.

392
00:28:39,436 --> 00:28:41,470
But if my mother
found out--

393
00:28:41,505 --> 00:28:44,140
It can be our secret.
Hmm?

394
00:28:46,109 --> 00:28:48,544
If we're going to be
man and wife,

395
00:28:48,578 --> 00:28:52,481
we'll have a few secrets
from her, I hope.

396
00:28:54,017 --> 00:28:56,485
So, Your Grace...

397
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:58,854
Yes?

398
00:28:58,889 --> 00:29:01,690
Tell me a secret.

399
00:29:05,729 --> 00:29:08,931
- ( cat meows )
- ( laughs )

400
00:29:08,965 --> 00:29:11,434
Hello. Aren't you
a proper fellow?

401
00:29:11,468 --> 00:29:13,836
That's Ser Pounce.

402
00:29:13,870 --> 00:29:16,238
Very handsome.

403
00:29:18,308 --> 00:29:19,742
Joffrey didn't like him.

404
00:29:19,776 --> 00:29:22,244
He threatened
to skin him alive

405
00:29:22,279 --> 00:29:24,113
and mix his innards
up in my food

406
00:29:24,147 --> 00:29:25,915
so I wouldn't know
I was eating him.

407
00:29:25,982 --> 00:29:28,684
That's very cruel.

408
00:29:28,718 --> 00:29:31,654
You don't strike me
as cruel.

409
00:29:33,123 --> 00:29:34,824
No.

410
00:29:34,858 --> 00:29:36,725
I don't think I am.

411
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:38,794
That's a relief.

412
00:29:38,829 --> 00:29:41,163
Because you know
what happens when we marry?

413
00:29:41,231 --> 00:29:43,432
We say our vows in front
of the high septon.

414
00:29:43,467 --> 00:29:45,267
And after the ceremony,
there's a feast.

415
00:29:45,302 --> 00:29:47,736
When we marry,
I become yours.

416
00:29:47,771 --> 00:29:49,338
Forever.

417
00:29:52,109 --> 00:29:53,843
It's getting late.

418
00:29:53,877 --> 00:29:55,611
( sighs )

419
00:29:55,645 --> 00:29:57,279
I should go.

420
00:29:58,315 --> 00:29:59,915
May I come and visit
you again?

421
00:30:02,052 --> 00:30:04,887
( laughs )
All right, then.

422
00:30:09,659 --> 00:30:11,427
Remember,

423
00:30:11,461 --> 00:30:15,097
our little secret.

424
00:30:46,229 --> 00:30:48,364
<i>( door closes )</i>

425
00:30:52,035 --> 00:30:53,669
Brienne:
<i>"Ser Jaime Lannister.</i>

426
00:30:53,703 --> 00:30:57,473
<i>Knighted and named</i>
<i>to the Kingsguard in his 16th year.</i>

427
00:30:57,507 --> 00:31:00,009
At the sack
of King's Landing,

428
00:31:00,043 --> 00:31:02,444
murdered his king
Aerys II.

429
00:31:02,479 --> 00:31:05,681
Pardoned by
Robert Baratheon.

430
00:31:06,983 --> 00:31:08,951
Thereafter known
as the Kingslayer."

431
00:31:08,985 --> 00:31:12,288
It's the duty of the Lord Commander
to fill those pages.

432
00:31:15,458 --> 00:31:18,260
And there's still room
left on mine.

433
00:31:48,458 --> 00:31:50,893
Valyrian steel.

434
00:31:50,961 --> 00:31:53,395
Mmm.

435
00:31:53,430 --> 00:31:54,730
It's yours.

436
00:31:54,764 --> 00:31:56,398
I can't accept this.

437
00:31:56,433 --> 00:31:58,734
It was reforged
from Ned Stark's sword.

438
00:31:58,768 --> 00:32:01,870
You'll use it to defend
Ned Stark's daughter.

439
00:32:03,473 --> 00:32:07,443
You swore an oath to return the
Stark girls to their mother.

440
00:32:07,477 --> 00:32:09,845
Lady Stark's dead.

441
00:32:09,879 --> 00:32:11,814
Arya's probably
dead, too,

442
00:32:11,848 --> 00:32:15,017
but there's still a chance to find Sansa
and get her somewhere safe.

443
00:32:16,319 --> 00:32:17,987
I've got something
else for you.

444
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:39,141
<i>I hope I got</i>
<i>your measurements right.</i>

445
00:32:41,778 --> 00:32:43,445
I'll find her.

446
00:32:45,115 --> 00:32:48,250
For Lady Catelyn.

447
00:32:51,254 --> 00:32:52,955
And for you.

448
00:32:59,863 --> 00:33:01,997
I almost forgot.

449
00:33:02,966 --> 00:33:05,134
I have one more gift.

450
00:33:08,972 --> 00:33:10,839
I don't need a squire.

451
00:33:10,874 --> 00:33:12,775
Of course you do.

452
00:33:12,809 --> 00:33:14,410
He'll slow me down.

453
00:33:14,444 --> 00:33:16,779
My brother owes him a debt.
He's not safe here.

454
00:33:16,813 --> 00:33:19,348
You're keeping him from harm.
It's chivalry.

455
00:33:19,382 --> 00:33:22,418
I won't
slow you down, ser--

456
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:25,888
my lady.

457
00:33:25,922 --> 00:33:28,390
<i>I promise</i>
<i>I'll serve you well.</i>

458
00:33:28,425 --> 00:33:31,727
See? He's a good lad.
You'll get along.

459
00:33:35,832 --> 00:33:38,233
Compliments of Lord Tyrion.

460
00:33:38,268 --> 00:33:41,270
His axe from the Blackwater.

461
00:33:46,376 --> 00:33:48,444
What are you
waiting for, a kiss?

462
00:33:50,146 --> 00:33:52,381
Ready the lady's horse.

463
00:34:01,691 --> 00:34:04,126
They say the best swords
have names.

464
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:05,594
Any ideas?

465
00:34:11,468 --> 00:34:13,435
Oathkeeper.

466
00:34:25,148 --> 00:34:26,815
Good-bye, Brienne.

467
00:34:50,340 --> 00:34:52,741
Podrick:
Come on, move.

468
00:35:17,100 --> 00:35:19,468
I should never
have taken her away.

469
00:35:19,502 --> 00:35:22,638
- She wasn't safe here.
- She's not safe out there.

470
00:35:22,672 --> 00:35:24,506
I should have known.

471
00:35:24,541 --> 00:35:26,708
You told us there were
wildlings south of the Wall.

472
00:35:26,743 --> 00:35:29,511
<i>If they're raiding the smaller villages,</i>
<i>Mole's Town could be next.</i>

473
00:35:29,546 --> 00:35:32,915
- Castle Black could be next.
- I should go back for Gilly.

474
00:35:32,949 --> 00:35:34,550
We have orders.
No one's to leave the castle.

475
00:35:34,584 --> 00:35:37,085
I remember when you disobeyed orders
and rode south to help Robb.

476
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:39,321
And I remember who came after me
and brought me home.

477
00:35:41,925 --> 00:35:44,793
I know how hard
it is, Sam, believe me.

478
00:35:46,930 --> 00:35:49,665
When you told me about Bran
going beyond the Wall,

479
00:35:49,699 --> 00:35:51,622
all I could think about
was getting my strength back

480
00:35:51,647 --> 00:35:53,293
so I could go and find him.

481
00:35:54,471 --> 00:35:56,939
I wish I could have convinced
him to come back with me.

482
00:35:58,575 --> 00:36:01,243
I tried.
Really, I did.

483
00:36:03,546 --> 00:36:05,814
How fast could they travel?

484
00:36:05,849 --> 00:36:09,318
A crippled boy being pulled
on a sledge by a simpleton?

485
00:36:09,352 --> 00:36:10,886
I don't know.

486
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:13,155
They'd pass
wildling villages.

487
00:36:13,189 --> 00:36:16,225
They could try to find
shelter at one of them.

488
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:20,462
The wildlings
have joined up with Mance.

489
00:36:20,497 --> 00:36:23,799
Every village or sheltered place
will be deserted.

490
00:36:27,270 --> 00:36:29,238
Except...

491
00:36:32,475 --> 00:36:34,810
Sam:
<i>Craster's?</i>

492
00:36:34,844 --> 00:36:37,279
You think Bran
might have found--

493
00:36:37,313 --> 00:36:39,748
Snow.

494
00:36:39,782 --> 00:36:41,416
I don't mean
to interrupt.

495
00:36:41,451 --> 00:36:44,119
Thorne wants to see you.

496
00:36:46,990 --> 00:36:50,259
Your foray
to Craster's Keep,

497
00:36:50,293 --> 00:36:52,361
I'll sanction it.

498
00:36:52,395 --> 00:36:56,265
But I won't order
anyone to go with you.

499
00:36:56,332 --> 00:36:58,967
Volunteers only.

500
00:36:59,002 --> 00:37:01,169
Thank you, Ser Alliser.

501
00:37:04,507 --> 00:37:07,309
( men chatting )

502
00:37:11,314 --> 00:37:13,649
Ahem, brothers.

503
00:37:13,683 --> 00:37:17,219
( chatter continues )

504
00:37:17,253 --> 00:37:19,922
( pounds )

505
00:37:25,161 --> 00:37:27,663
I'm going beyond the Wall
to Craster's Keep.

506
00:37:27,697 --> 00:37:32,067
I'm going to capture the mutineers
holed up there or kill them.

507
00:37:32,101 --> 00:37:35,203
<i>I'm asking for volunteers</i>
<i>to come with me.</i>

508
00:37:36,873 --> 00:37:39,541
There's 60 miles of wilderness
between here and Craster's

509
00:37:39,576 --> 00:37:42,377
and Mance Rayder has an army
bearing down on us,

510
00:37:42,412 --> 00:37:44,479
but we have to do this.

511
00:37:44,514 --> 00:37:47,783
<i>Our survival</i>
<i>may depend on</i>

512
00:37:47,817 --> 00:37:50,652
<i>us getting to these mutineers</i>
<i>before Mance does.</i>

513
00:37:50,687 --> 00:37:54,356
They know the Wall.
They know our defenses.

514
00:37:54,390 --> 00:37:57,392
If Mance learns what
they know, we're lost.

515
00:37:59,829 --> 00:38:02,164
But if that's not enough,

516
00:38:02,198 --> 00:38:04,666
then consider this.

517
00:38:04,701 --> 00:38:07,035
If the Night's Watch
are truly brothers,

518
00:38:07,070 --> 00:38:10,038
then Lord Commander Mormont
was our father.

519
00:38:11,307 --> 00:38:13,408
He lived and died
for the Watch

520
00:38:13,443 --> 00:38:15,911
and he was betrayed
by his own men.

521
00:38:15,979 --> 00:38:17,646
Stabbed in the back
by cowards.

522
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:19,615
He deserved far better.

523
00:38:19,649 --> 00:38:23,185
All we can give him now
is justice.

524
00:38:24,587 --> 00:38:26,488
Who will join me?

525
00:39:16,139 --> 00:39:18,740
I can't let a recruit
come north of the Wall.

526
00:39:18,775 --> 00:39:21,043
Then let me say my vows.

527
00:39:21,077 --> 00:39:22,438
If it's a fight you're
heading for,

528
00:39:22,441 --> 00:39:24,441
then you need men
who know how.

529
00:39:36,793 --> 00:39:38,660
Thank you, brothers.

530

535

538
00:40:17,834 --> 00:40:21,970
Any command for us,
Lord Commander?

539
00:40:22,038 --> 00:40:24,573
What's that?

540
00:40:24,607 --> 00:40:27,042
Fuck 'em

541
00:40:27,076 --> 00:40:30,612
- ( whimpers )
- <i>Did you hear that, boys?</i>

542
00:40:30,646 --> 00:40:33,281
Fuck 'em
till they're dead.

543
00:40:39,856 --> 00:40:41,223
Rast.

544
00:40:46,696 --> 00:40:48,964
Go outside
and feed the beast.

545
00:40:48,998 --> 00:40:51,333
We should kill that thing.

546
00:40:52,468 --> 00:40:55,337
You should shut
your fucking hole,

547
00:40:55,371 --> 00:40:58,373
ugly little cunt.

548
00:40:58,407 --> 00:41:01,810
You look like
a fucking ballsack.

549
00:41:01,844 --> 00:41:04,613
Ugly. Look at your
stupid cunt face.

550
00:41:04,647 --> 00:41:08,216
I could piss in any gutter
and soak five of you.

551
00:41:09,986 --> 00:41:13,622
Know how much they paid me to kill
a man in King's Landing?

552
00:41:13,656 --> 00:41:16,258
Seven silvers.

553
00:41:16,292 --> 00:41:20,028
They told me a man's name
and that man never saw daylight again.

554
00:41:20,062 --> 00:41:22,831
None of them cocksuckers
got away from me.

555
00:41:26,736 --> 00:41:29,437
Haven't lost a fight
since I was nine.

556
00:41:31,174 --> 00:41:33,308
Maybe it's time.

557
00:41:33,342 --> 00:41:36,077
What do you think, eh?

558
00:41:36,112 --> 00:41:39,181
Maybe you're the man.

559
00:41:39,215 --> 00:41:42,350
Eh, cunt?

560
00:41:44,620 --> 00:41:47,088
I wouldn't stand a chance.

561
00:41:47,957 --> 00:41:49,157
None of us would.

562
00:41:49,192 --> 00:41:52,227
I was a fucking legend
in Gin Alley.

563
00:41:52,261 --> 00:41:55,363
A fucking legend!

564
00:41:55,398 --> 00:41:56,998
I would take any knight--

565
00:41:57,033 --> 00:41:59,768
any knight, any time.

566
00:41:59,802 --> 00:42:03,471
Fucking cunts in steel plate.
Fucking cowards.

568
00:42:11,914 --> 00:42:15,483
- A gift for the gods.
- A gift for the gods.

569
00:42:15,518 --> 00:42:17,085
A gift for the gods.

570
00:42:17,119 --> 00:42:18,653
What the fuck is that?

571
00:42:18,688 --> 00:42:21,857
Craster's last child.
A boy.

572
00:42:21,891 --> 00:42:23,425
What am I supposed
to do with him?

573
00:42:23,459 --> 00:42:26,294
What did Craster
do with 'em?

574
00:42:26,329 --> 00:42:29,531
Kill 'em before they could grow up
and do the same to him?

575
00:42:30,900 --> 00:42:32,601
All right.

576
00:42:36,038 --> 00:42:37,672
Don't need another
mouth to feed.

577
00:42:37,707 --> 00:42:40,909
- Hand him over.
- He didn't kill them.

578
00:42:40,943 --> 00:42:43,645
- He offered them.
- To who?

579
00:42:43,679 --> 00:42:45,847
To the gods.

580
00:42:45,882 --> 00:42:48,149
The white walkers.

581
00:42:48,184 --> 00:42:50,218
Women: A gift for the gods.
A gift for the gods.

582
00:42:50,253 --> 00:42:53,088
A gift for the gods.
A gift for the gods.

583
00:42:53,122 --> 00:42:55,624
A gift for the gods.
A gift for the gods.

584
00:42:55,658 --> 00:42:57,359
Shut up!

585
00:43:03,432 --> 00:43:05,500
So...

586
00:43:07,970 --> 00:43:10,505
if it worked for him...

587
00:43:10,539 --> 00:43:12,173

588
00:43:12,208 --> 00:43:14,876
Let's give the walkers
what they want.

590
00:43:22,184 --> 00:43:24,452

Pink-eyed fuck.

You thirsty?

Hodor.

Do you hear that?

606
00:46:10,352 --> 00:46:12,120
Is that a baby?

607
00:46:12,154 --> 00:46:14,722
It's coming.

608
00:46:14,757 --> 00:46:16,491
I'm going out there.

609
00:46:16,525 --> 00:46:18,626
No, we need
to stay together.

610
00:46:18,661 --> 00:46:20,528
I'm going.

- Hodor.
- Bran, what happened?

617
00:47:06,242 --> 00:47:08,943
Summer, he's hurt.
They've caught him in a trap.

618
00:47:08,978 --> 00:47:10,345
Who?

619
00:47:10,379 --> 00:47:13,047
I didn't see, but they
have my brother's wolf.

620
00:47:14,683 --> 00:47:16,885
They have Ghost.

621
00:47:22,258 --> 00:47:23,858
Bran:
<i>They're Night's Watch.</i>

622
00:47:23,893 --> 00:47:25,994
Look.

623
00:47:26,028 --> 00:47:28,463
<i>Jon might be here.</i>

624
00:47:28,497 --> 00:47:31,833
If Jon was here, why would
they put his wolf in a cage?

They might have been
Night's Watch once, not anymore.

00:47:40,442 --> 00:47:42,277
We're not safe here.
We need to go.

629
00:47:42,311 --> 00:47:43,811
No.

630
00:47:43,846 --> 00:47:46,181
Bran, we need to go now.

631
00:47:46,215 --> 00:47:48,082
I'm not leaving
without Summer.

632
00:47:54,924 --> 00:47:56,591
Can you remember
where the cage was?

633
00:47:56,625 --> 00:47:59,194
The east side
of the keep.

634
00:48:01,564 --> 00:48:04,632
If I'm not back
soon, we'll meet--

635
00:48:04,667 --> 00:48:06,501
Hodor.

Hodor.
Hodor.

640
00:48:29,758 --> 00:48:32,627
Hodor.

641
00:48:32,661 --> 00:48:35,897
If I was your size,
I'd be king of the fucking world.

642

643
00:48:47,576 --> 00:48:49,577
Help him up.

644
00:49:12,201 --> 00:49:14,002
This is nice.

645
00:49:15,437 --> 00:49:17,839
Fine leather.

646
00:49:19,208 --> 00:49:21,276
You're no wildling.

647
00:49:21,310 --> 00:49:23,811
Important. Highborn.

648
00:49:26,015 --> 00:49:28,182
Who are you?

650
00:49:37,526 --> 00:49:39,193
You see,
where I come from,

651
00:49:39,228 --> 00:49:41,763
a commoner like me slaps
a little lord like you,

652
00:49:41,797 --> 00:49:44,032
I'd lose my right hand.

653
00:49:44,066 --> 00:49:48,102
But we're a long way
from home, aren't we?

654
00:49:49,538 --> 00:49:51,572
And the two of you,

655
00:49:51,607 --> 00:49:55,176
fancy-looking folks
north of the Wall

656
00:49:55,210 --> 00:49:57,445

the woods.

657
00:49:58,781 --> 00:50:01,082
Isn't that a bit odd?

658
00:50:04,486 --> 00:50:06,754
I like your curly hair.

659
00:50:08,557 --> 00:50:11,759
My mom had curls
like that.

660
00:50:11,794 --> 00:50:14,762
Beautiful brown curls.

661
00:50:16,165 --> 00:50:19,334
Why'd you drag a crippled
boy all the way up here?

662

See you haven't played
this game before.

663
