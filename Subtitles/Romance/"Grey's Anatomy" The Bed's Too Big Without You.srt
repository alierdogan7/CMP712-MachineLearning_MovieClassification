Hi. I texted you.

19
00:01:42,335 --> 00:01:43,893
Yeah, I saw that. I was busy.

20
00:01:43,970 --> 00:01:46,302
Well, Cristina would've responded.
That's not how it works.

21
00:01:46,372 --> 00:01:47,839
Not if she was doing what I was doing.

22
00:01:47,907 --> 00:01:49,602
You pause. That's the rule.

23
00:01:49,676 --> 00:01:51,303
- What?
- If the text is urgent,

24
00:01:51,377 --> 00:01:53,038
Cristina would say to Owen, "Pause,"

25
00:01:53,113 --> 00:01:55,581
and I would say to Derek, "Pause,"
then we'd text each other back.

26
00:01:55,648 --> 00:01:58,139
- In the middle of sex?
- If the text is urgent.

27
00:01:58,218 --> 00:02:00,914
The fact you are checking your text
while you're doing it is already sad.

28
00:02:00,987 --> 00:02:03,615
We have a special ringtone.
Hey, you want a special ringtone?

29
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:06,716
No. Wait, this pause thing...

in the air and you're screaming and...

31
00:02:09,195 --> 00:02:12,460
- Pause.
- No, I don't pause. Jo doesn't pause.

32
00:02:12,532 --> 00:02:14,693
She fast-forwards, she rewinds,

33
00:02:14,767 --> 00:02:16,632
- but she doesn't pause.
- Okay, that's gross.

Do you wanna scrub in
on my IVC sarcoma?

- (EXHALES DEEPLY) Is it a kid?
- No.

36
00:02:20,406 --> 00:02:21,395
Then no. Why?

37
00:02:21,474 --> 00:02:23,305
Because I want some company.

38
00:02:23,376 --> 00:02:24,365
Get a resident.

39
00:02:24,444 --> 00:02:26,378
I have a resident. I want a grownup.

00:02:26,446 --> 00:02:27,538
Bye.

41
00:02:27,614 --> 00:02:29,206

You wanna scrub in

Well, you don't need me for that.
Don't you have a resident?

45
00:02:34,988 --> 00:02:36,979
Residents are boring.
All they wanna do is learn.

Come on. It's gonna be good.

00:02:38,324 --> 00:02:41,555
It's all over the liver, hepatic vein.
It's gonna be bloody and gross.

Presents with abdominal pain.

00:02:50,103 --> 00:02:54,005
Scans show a leiomyosarcoma
behind the liver, including the IVC.

52
00:02:54,073 --> 00:02:55,597
What's the surgical plan?

53
00:02:55,675 --> 00:02:57,734
Laparotomy to isolate the vessel,

54
00:02:57,810 --> 00:03:00,370
resect the tumor,
and then replace with a graft.

55
00:03:00,446 --> 00:03:02,346
It's a pretty straightforward
procedure, Adrian.

56
00:03:02,415 --> 00:03:03,973
I don't foresee any problems.

57
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:05,608
Could I ask you to...

58
00:03:05,685 --> 00:03:07,448
It's silly. Never mind.

59
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:09,352
MEREDITH: What is it?

60
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:12,553

The <i>Odyssey.</i>

62
00:03:15,495 --> 00:03:18,487
- It's the first book I ever sold to Adrian.
- The day we met.

63
00:03:18,565 --> 00:03:20,556
Michael's a rare book vendor.

64
00:03:20,633 --> 00:03:22,362
Our hands touched
when I was ringing her up,

65
00:03:22,435 --> 00:03:24,403
and it was such a high. (CHUCKLES)

66
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:25,494
It was electric.

67
00:03:26,372 --> 00:03:28,101
We were both too shy to ask for a date.

68
00:03:28,174 --> 00:03:29,903
So I wrote my number on a bookmark.

69
00:03:29,976 --> 00:03:32,911
I saw it as soon as I got home,
and then I called.

70
00:03:32,979 --> 00:03:34,913
We've been together ever since.

71
00:03:36,182 --> 00:03:39,049
This book, it's our wedding ring.

72
00:03:39,953 --> 00:03:43,150
Could you swear on the book, Dr. Grey,
that you'll do your best?

73
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:44,315
It would mean so much.

74
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:47,657
Dr. Wilson, too.

75
00:03:47,727 --> 00:03:48,785
- Sure.
- I swear.

76
00:03:53,199 --> 00:03:56,600
MEREDITH: So Dr. Wilson will
prep you, and I'll see you up there.

77
00:03:57,537 --> 00:03:59,300
They're adorable.

78
00:03:59,372 --> 00:04:00,805
They're weirdos.

79
00:04:01,474 --> 00:04:03,339
Okay, you're gonna feel
a little bit of pressure.

80
00:04:03,409 --> 00:04:05,343
And this will tell us conclusively

81
00:04:05,411 --> 00:04:08,073
if the osteogenesis imperfecta
is type II or III?

82
00:04:08,147 --> 00:04:09,978
- Yes.
- It's probably type III though, right?

83
00:04:10,049 --> 00:04:12,677
I mean, so far there's been
no indication of fetal distress.

84
00:04:12,752 --> 00:04:13,912
We'll know soon enough.

85
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:18,952
It'll be okay. OI type III, it's hard, sure.

86
00:04:19,025 --> 00:04:21,425
I mean, there's surgeries
and challenges, but we're surgeons.

87
00:04:21,494 --> 00:04:24,088
We can handle challenges, right?

88
00:04:24,163 --> 00:04:25,596
- Mmm-hmm.
- I mean, we'll...

89
00:04:25,665 --> 00:04:29,396
We'll still be able to give
our baby a wonderful life. Right?

90
00:04:29,469 --> 00:04:32,666
Many type III babies
live very, very happy lives.

91
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:39,437
Shouldn't Dr. Herman be doing this?

92
00:04:39,846 --> 00:04:41,541
It's a very routine procedure.

93
00:04:41,614 --> 00:04:43,980
Dr. Herman is the big gun.

94
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:46,416
We only fire the big gun
when we need the big gun.

95
00:04:46,486 --> 00:04:49,649
I'm the little gun.
So let the little gun work.

96
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:03,233
Thank you so much.
I know that took up a lot of your time.

97
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:05,066
I just wanna get all of the views

98
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:07,163
with the thinnest cross sections
I can get.

99
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,434
And I find that adorable.

100
00:05:09,409 --> 00:05:11,775
You really think you can
pull off your plan, huh?

101
00:05:11,844 --> 00:05:14,176
I've got all your past medical records.

102
00:05:14,247 --> 00:05:15,714
Once I get a firm grasp

103
00:05:15,782 --> 00:05:18,410
on the roads your other surgeons
took to get to "no,"

104
00:05:18,484 --> 00:05:20,281
I can cut away a clear path to "yes."

105
00:05:20,586 --> 00:05:22,850
By the time I'm done with your tumor,
I'm gonna be able to tell you

106
00:05:22,922 --> 00:05:26,153
what street this bastard grew up on
and where it lost its virginity.

107
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:28,249
Hmm! Well, you certainly are confident.

108
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:30,057
- Thank you.
- Or delusional.

109
00:05:30,963 --> 00:05:32,089
One of the two.

110
00:05:32,498 --> 00:05:35,695
It's hard to tell. They look so similar.

111
00:05:40,406 --> 00:05:43,534
So I think we need to talk
about what we'll decide

112
00:05:43,609 --> 00:05:44,940
if it turns out the baby's type II.

113
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:46,478
I already told you, he won't be.

114
00:05:46,546 --> 00:05:49,174
Yeah, I know that's what you believe.
So do I, obviously.

115
00:05:49,248 --> 00:05:52,411
But if he is type II, then it's so terrible...

116
00:05:52,485 --> 00:05:54,919
- I know. (SIGHS)
...and fatal usually.

117
00:05:54,987 --> 00:05:56,477
All right? And before that,
it's even worse.

118
00:05:56,556 --> 00:05:59,525
I know all of this. I just...
I don't wanna talk about it.

119
00:05:59,592 --> 00:06:01,492
But we should talk about it.
We need to talk about it.

120
00:06:01,561 --> 00:06:03,722
Why? Why can't we just wait
until tomorrow?

121
00:06:03,796 --> 00:06:06,697
Because we should have a plan.
What do you mean?

122
00:06:06,766 --> 00:06:08,893
Okay, what do you wanna do?

123
00:06:08,968 --> 00:06:11,459
That's what I'm saying.
I think we should decide.

124
00:06:11,537 --> 00:06:14,097
No, no. I'm asking what you want.

125
00:06:14,173 --> 00:06:16,266
I want for us to figure this out together.

126
00:06:16,342 --> 00:06:17,673
I don't think that's true.

127
00:06:17,744 --> 00:06:19,769
I think that you already know
what you would wanna do.

128
00:06:19,846 --> 00:06:20,972
- So...
- What?

129
00:06:21,047 --> 00:06:23,481
Just... Yeah, just say it out loud.

130
00:06:23,549 --> 00:06:25,949
- Don't...
- Right now. What do you wanna do?

131
00:06:26,018 --> 00:06:27,349
(SIGHS DEEPLY)

132
00:06:32,058 --> 00:06:34,583
If our baby is type II, I...

133
00:06:36,496 --> 00:06:38,487
I think we should terminate.

134
00:06:41,801 --> 00:06:45,237
And I don't care whether
our baby is type II or type III.

135
00:06:45,304 --> 00:06:47,363

Either way, I wanna keep him.

137
00:06:48,608 --> 00:06:50,838
I told you I didn't wanna talk about this.

138
00:06:55,681 --> 00:06:57,239
JO: Look at all these adhesions.

139
00:06:57,316 --> 00:06:59,216
MIRANDA: Yeah, there's no way
to see 'em coming.

140
00:06:59,285 --> 00:07:01,719
Sneaky little bastards
won't show up on the scan.

141
00:07:01,788 --> 00:07:04,018
MEREDITH: And there's more
of them posteriorly, too.

142
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:05,455
I need some more exposure.

143
00:07:05,525 --> 00:07:07,015
JO: You're thinking of extending
the incision?

144
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:09,323
MEREDITH: I have to.
I can't see what's up in there.

145
00:07:09,395 --> 00:07:12,796
This tumor just keeps coming.
And all the landmarks are obscured.

146
00:07:12,865 --> 00:07:15,095
I'm lost in here. It's like going in blind.

147
00:07:15,168 --> 00:07:17,261
Hey! Would you bring
those scans closer, please?

148
00:07:17,336 --> 00:07:18,667
MAN: Yes, Doctor.

149
00:07:20,306 --> 00:07:22,900
See, the tumor should be
in the suprahepatic IVC only.

150
00:07:22,975 --> 00:07:23,999
MEREDITH: That can't be right.

151
00:07:24,076 --> 00:07:25,805
It doesn't show
any further local invasion.

152
00:07:25,878 --> 00:07:27,311
Show me the coronal view?

153
00:07:28,848 --> 00:07:30,440
MIRANDA: What's the tumor doing
all the way over there?

154
00:07:30,516 --> 00:07:32,074
MEREDITH: That's what I want to know.

155
00:07:32,151 --> 00:07:34,346
- How old are these scans?
- JO: They're only two weeks old.

156
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:35,887
MEREDITH: And they're
completely outdated.

157
00:07:35,955 --> 00:07:37,946
I mean, this thing is growing too fast.

158
00:07:38,024 --> 00:07:39,423
Nothing is where it's supposed to be.

159

MIRANDA: Tumor has extended to
the IVC tributaries.

160
00:07:41,961 --> 00:07:44,293
- Yeah, these scans are useless.
- MEREDITH: I can't see what I'm doing.

161
00:07:44,363 --> 00:07:47,355
Oh, God. It's also spreading
through the diaphragm. Suction.

162

- I can't even see where...

MEREDITH: Don't touch that.
It's tearing.

165
00:07:52,672 --> 00:07:54,867

the way up between the lungs.

166
00:07:54,941 --> 00:07:57,432

- It's all the way up into the pericardium.

167
00:07:57,510 --> 00:07:59,637

Don't touch it. Don't do anything.

00:08:01,047 --> 00:08:03,242
MEREDITH: We gotta get out.
Everybody out. Hands off.

170
00:08:03,649 --> 00:08:05,412
(MONITOR BEEPING STEADILY)

171
00:08:10,189 --> 00:08:12,054
JO: What are we doing?
What's going on?

172
00:08:17,396 --> 00:08:19,591
Can someone say something?
What are we doing?

173
00:08:19,665 --> 00:08:21,792
MIRANDA: It's spread from her
major blood vessels to her liver,

174
00:08:21,868 --> 00:08:24,132
diaphragm, pericardium,
and maybe even her heart.

175
00:08:24,203 --> 00:08:26,433
How can one tumor
grow this big this fast?

176
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:28,371
- MIRANDA: It is everywhere.
- It's a monster.

177
00:08:28,441 --> 00:08:29,772
So what do we do?

178
00:08:33,479 --> 00:08:34,571
I have no idea.

179
00:08:49,996 --> 00:08:53,329
MEREDITH: Michael, I'm afraid
Adrian's tumor has grown considerably

180
00:08:53,399 --> 00:08:55,333
and it's now reaching around her heart.

181
00:08:55,401 --> 00:08:57,096
So Dr. Pierce is here.

182
00:08:57,169 --> 00:08:58,932
Her heart?

183
00:08:59,005 --> 00:09:01,235
It's entangled through the vein
that stretches up

184
00:09:01,307 --> 00:09:02,934
from her liver to her heart.

185
00:09:03,009 --> 00:09:05,500
And it's growing
more rapidly than anticipated.

186
00:09:05,578 --> 00:09:07,705
So we need to take her for more MRIs

187
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:11,147
so we can see how extensive
the tumor's growth is.

188
00:09:11,484 --> 00:09:13,076
Now there's all of you.

189
00:09:13,853 --> 00:09:15,946
Three doctors. (INHALES DEEPLY)

190
00:09:16,522 --> 00:09:17,784
Three is a lot.

191
00:09:21,193 --> 00:09:25,152
Look, Odysseus didn't return
to Ithaca all by himself.

192
00:09:25,231 --> 00:09:28,394
He needed a lot of help, right,
from the Phaeacians?

193
00:09:28,467 --> 00:09:30,401
Well, we're the Phaeacians.

194
00:09:30,469 --> 00:09:33,233
You want all the Phaeacians
you can get.

195
00:09:33,306 --> 00:09:35,638
We are going to figure this tumor out.

196
00:09:39,512 --> 00:09:40,501
Oh!

197
00:09:41,847 --> 00:09:43,576
- Mmm! So light.
- And it's last year's model.

198
00:09:43,649 --> 00:09:46,641
We're weeks away from unveiling one
that will weigh 30% less.

199
00:09:46,719 --> 00:09:48,619
Wow. Very impressive.

200
00:09:48,688 --> 00:09:50,519
Your project is impressive.

201
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:53,582
Robotic limbs for injured vets?
Sexy as hell.

202
00:09:53,659 --> 00:09:57,652
And we at CyberSystems are dying
to climb into bed with you.

203
00:09:57,730 --> 00:09:59,459
Well, that's very flattering.

204
00:09:59,532 --> 00:10:01,261
Good. I want it to be.

205
00:10:01,534 --> 00:10:04,662
I'll leave you this folder
so you can go over the materials.

206
00:10:04,737 --> 00:10:06,500
I'll be in Seattle another day,

207
00:10:06,572 --> 00:10:09,803
so, please, call me
if you need anything.

208
00:10:09,875 --> 00:10:12,469
Thank you. Thank you for coming in.

209
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:16,039
So what do you think?

210
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:17,946
- I think you should definitely go for it.
- Really?

211
00:10:18,017 --> 00:10:19,951
'Cause I was not that impressed
with these transducers.

212
00:10:20,019 --> 00:10:22,317
What? No. No, those things are crap.

213
00:10:22,388 --> 00:10:23,980
I'm talking about her.

214
00:10:24,056 --> 00:10:26,490
Her vibes? You didn't feel her vibes?

215
00:10:27,093 --> 00:10:29,391
Major vibage for Major Hunt.

216
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:32,363
- (SCOFFS) You read that totally wrong.
- Oh, please.

217
00:10:32,431 --> 00:10:34,331
"Your project's sexy as hell.

218
00:10:34,533 --> 00:10:36,660
"Ooh! Ooh, let's climb into bed."

219
00:10:36,736 --> 00:10:37,862
I was actually uncomfortable.

220
00:10:37,937 --> 00:10:39,063
- Stop it!
- (GIGGLES)

221
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:42,674
There you are. Where have you been?

222
00:10:42,742 --> 00:10:44,676
I was performing a CVS
on April Kepner.

223
00:10:44,744 --> 00:10:46,735
We're just waiting for the results.
God, I hate waiting.

224
00:10:46,812 --> 00:10:48,177
In peds, it's so much easier.

225
00:10:48,247 --> 00:10:49,805
You know, the parents are right there.

226
00:10:49,882 --> 00:10:52,112
And you talk to them,
and then their kid is right there,

227
00:10:52,184 --> 00:10:54,448
so they can hold them close
and hope for the best.

228
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:55,646
The cat's on the roof.

229
00:10:55,721 --> 00:10:57,188
With this, there's no kid to hold.

230
00:10:57,256 --> 00:10:59,622
The problem feels so theoretical.

231
00:10:59,692 --> 00:11:01,091
You know, there's no cat,
there's no roof.

232
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:03,094
There's just two scared parents
feeling totally helpless.

233
00:11:03,162 --> 00:11:04,424
And you've had the results rushed?

234
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:06,397
Yeah. I should get them in,
like, 24 hours.

235
00:11:06,465 --> 00:11:09,832
Then there's nothing more
to do about it today, which is good.

236
00:11:09,902 --> 00:11:11,665
I have been working miracles.

237
00:11:12,538 --> 00:11:16,565
I have found us
the most incredible surgeries,

238
00:11:16,642 --> 00:11:17,904
all for the next few weeks.

239
00:11:17,977 --> 00:11:20,605
Look, a TTTS in a 19-weeker,

240
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:23,672
a 21 -week TRAP sequence
that needs an RFA,

241
00:11:23,749 --> 00:11:25,910
a unilateral pulmonary agenesis.

242
00:11:25,985 --> 00:11:27,680
And that is just the beginning.

243
00:11:27,753 --> 00:11:30,483
- The beginning of what?
- Your crash course.

244
00:11:30,556 --> 00:11:33,491
I have hunted down
the most screwed up,

245
00:11:33,559 --> 00:11:35,993
medically compromised fetuses
that I could find,

246
00:11:36,062 --> 00:11:38,121
and I'm bringing them all here
to this hospital

247
00:11:38,197 --> 00:11:40,495
for you to learn and us to save.

248
00:11:40,566 --> 00:11:42,864
- And you'll get to fix them all?
- We will.

249
00:11:43,335 --> 00:11:44,563
Start reading.

250
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:48,267
You can thank me later.

251
00:11:54,613 --> 00:11:56,945
And then, and this sounds crazy,
I know, so don't even...

252
00:11:57,016 --> 00:12:01,214
I'll build in a distribution
of a radioactive seed during surgery,

253
00:12:01,287 --> 00:12:04,256
keeping Dr. Herman's tumor bed
free of recurring cells.

254
00:12:04,323 --> 00:12:05,722
I thought you were gonna use a laser.

255
00:12:05,791 --> 00:12:08,089
I am. I already did. We're way past that.

256
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:09,184
RICHARD: Try and keep up.

257
00:12:09,261 --> 00:12:12,025
I'm sorry, Shepherd,
but this is a great opportunity

258
00:12:12,098 --> 00:12:13,565
- for them to learn.
- I know. It's fine.

259
00:12:13,632 --> 00:12:16,260
The laser is for ablating cells
off the optic nerve.

260
00:12:16,335 --> 00:12:19,429
- It's a massive butterfly glioma.
- Well, it's not just massive.

261
00:12:19,505 --> 00:12:21,973
I mean, it's magnificent.

262
00:12:22,041 --> 00:12:24,737
No, no, no.
I mean that won't a laser take months?

263
00:12:24,810 --> 00:12:27,335
Again, before that, I'll be using

264
00:12:27,413 --> 00:12:30,143
the ultrasonic surgical aspirator
to mush and flush the cells,

265
00:12:30,216 --> 00:12:32,548
then the sexy laser and the... Yeah.

266
00:12:32,618 --> 00:12:33,744
I'm sorry. I'm just lost.

267
00:12:33,819 --> 00:12:35,013
You were just talking about
laser ablation.

268
00:12:35,087 --> 00:12:36,554
So is that confined to the optic chiasm

269
00:12:36,622 --> 00:12:38,749
- or will that extend...
- Guys, step back.

270
00:12:39,058 --> 00:12:42,892
Look at the whole big,
beautiful, shapely thing.

271
00:12:42,962 --> 00:12:46,796
Every part of this tumor's body
will respond differently.

272
00:12:46,866 --> 00:12:48,959
You will need a multitude
of approaches.

273
00:12:49,034 --> 00:12:52,299
You will have to be gentle with one part
and rough with the other.

274
00:12:52,371 --> 00:12:56,171
That is the only way she will respond.
Get it?

275
00:12:56,242 --> 00:12:57,641
I don't see tumors the way she does.

276
00:12:57,710 --> 00:13:01,339
Didn't five surgeons say
any one of these approaches would

277
00:13:01,413 --> 00:13:02,937
likely kill the patient?

278
00:13:03,015 --> 00:13:04,277
Six.

279
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:08,081
But none of them tried it all
at the same time. It should work.

280
00:13:08,154 --> 00:13:10,918
Maybe we should start over again
from the beginning.

281
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:12,014
Okay.

282
00:13:12,992 --> 00:13:16,450
I will begin with a bifrontal approach.

283
00:13:16,529 --> 00:13:18,929
MAGGIE: Is that the right atrium?
I can't tell.

284
00:13:18,998 --> 00:13:21,023
Everything looks like mush.

285
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:22,727
Look at this angle right here.

286
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:24,235
Is that invading the right atrium?

287
00:13:24,303 --> 00:13:25,463
I think that's a motion artifact.

288
00:13:25,538 --> 00:13:27,438
- Crap.
- MIRANDA: Adrian's back in her room.

289
00:13:27,506 --> 00:13:29,667
Stable for now. How we doing here?

290
00:13:29,742 --> 00:13:32,677
- Has the Cyclops revealed himself?
- The Cyclops?

291
00:13:32,745 --> 00:13:34,440
Well, the patient's a fan
of The <i>Odyssey,</i>

292
00:13:34,513 --> 00:13:38,108
so I'm calling the tumor the Cyclops
'cause it's a big, ugly monster.

293
00:13:38,184 --> 00:13:41,085
And I feel like I'm working with one eye
because I can see it,

294
00:13:41,153 --> 00:13:43,644
but I can't get a sense
of the whole thing.

295
00:13:43,722 --> 00:13:44,984
Every view is incomplete.

296
00:13:45,057 --> 00:13:48,993
Okay, what if we get a new set
of scans, with contrast,

297
00:13:49,061 --> 00:13:50,858
this time with 3-D reconstruction?

298
00:13:50,930 --> 00:13:52,522
Well, the woman's lying open
in her bed.

299
00:13:52,598 --> 00:13:54,225
We don't have time
for a lot of trial and error.

300
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:56,234
I just wanna reach in and grab it.

301
00:13:56,302 --> 00:13:59,533
Well, we could go in with these,
but, yeah, I can't see.

302
00:14:00,906 --> 00:14:04,535
If I could just hold it in my hand
so that I could see it...

303
00:14:05,444 --> 00:14:06,968
- Holy crap.
- What?

304
00:14:07,046 --> 00:14:08,172
She's having an idea.

305
00:14:08,247 --> 00:14:10,442
I already had it last year,
and it's brilliant.

306
00:14:10,516 --> 00:14:14,418
We are going to print it.
The whole tumor.

307
00:14:14,486 --> 00:14:16,579
I tried it with the portal veins,
but it's not working.

308
00:14:16,655 --> 00:14:18,816
But with this,
we don't need it to function.

309
00:14:18,891 --> 00:14:22,224
She's got a functioning tumor.
We just need to be able to see it,

310
00:14:22,294 --> 00:14:24,455
- so we know how to kill it.
- MIRANDA: Know your enemy.

311
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:25,792
- Is this gonna work?
- It'll work.

312
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:27,059
MIRANDA: Oh, 2% left to upload.

313
00:14:27,132 --> 00:14:28,997
This is how we beat this thing.

314
00:14:29,068 --> 00:14:31,263
This is how we get visualization.

315
00:14:31,337 --> 00:14:35,205
We are going to have
a tangible, anatomically correct

316
00:14:35,274 --> 00:14:39,768
3-D model of this exact tumor,
and correlate to the adjacent organs...

317
00:14:39,845 --> 00:14:41,369
- Done!
- Loaded!

318
00:14:52,391 --> 00:14:53,380
(MACHINE BEEPS)

319
00:14:56,095 --> 00:14:57,585
In 10 hours.

320
00:14:59,932 --> 00:15:02,924
The longest documented surviving
type II case that I could find

321
00:15:03,002 --> 00:15:04,560
lived for all of 18 months.

322
00:15:04,637 --> 00:15:06,571
In an ICU his entire life,

323
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:08,971
hooked up to feeding tubes
and a ventilator.

324
00:15:09,041 --> 00:15:10,440
That's not a life.

325
00:15:10,509 --> 00:15:11,942
That's not a life I want for my son.

326
00:15:12,011 --> 00:15:14,571
(STAMMERS) Neither do I. I...

327
00:15:14,647 --> 00:15:16,137
Okay. So then how can you...

328
00:15:16,215 --> 00:15:18,479
Because we don't know
what will happen.

329
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:21,451
- We don't even know if he's type II.
- Okay, but what if he is?

330
00:15:22,554 --> 00:15:25,751
Any amount of time that he survives,
any amount of time that he lives...

331
00:15:25,824 --> 00:15:28,520
- Will be with us, in our arms.
- Yes.

332
00:15:28,594 --> 00:15:31,062
Knowing that he's loved and wanted.

333
00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:33,428
Baby, his bones can break
if you touch him.

334
00:15:33,499 --> 00:15:35,524
His bones can break
if we're changing his diaper.

335
00:15:35,601 --> 00:15:36,966
We're doctors. We can handle it.

336
00:15:37,036 --> 00:15:38,697
If anyone can handle it, we can.

337
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:41,433
I'm not saying we can't handle it.
I'm asking if we should.

338
00:15:41,507 --> 00:15:42,531
Yeah, we're doctors.

339
00:15:42,608 --> 00:15:45,042
Maybe we are better equipped to
make an educated decision here.

340
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:47,908
And maybe we were
given this baby for a reason.

341
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:49,072
KAREN: April.

342
00:15:50,883 --> 00:15:52,248
(SIGHS) You called your mom.

343
00:15:52,318 --> 00:15:54,786
Yeah. People need their mom
in a crisis.

344
00:15:54,853 --> 00:15:56,912
No, not everybody does.

345
00:15:56,989 --> 00:15:59,958
I came as soon as I got
your call, sweetie.

346
00:16:00,025 --> 00:16:02,585
It's okay. Everything's gonna be okay.

347
00:16:02,661 --> 00:16:03,923
I'm here.

348
00:16:06,131 --> 00:16:07,325
Are you working today?

349
00:16:08,734 --> 00:16:10,497
- No.
- Then let's get out of here.

350
00:16:10,569 --> 00:16:13,333
- You could use a change of scenery.
- That's actually a really good idea.

351
00:16:13,405 --> 00:16:14,804
We should take the day,

352
00:16:14,873 --> 00:16:17,171
go somewhere nice,
maybe drive to the ocean.

353
00:16:17,242 --> 00:16:18,675
Let's go to church.

354
00:16:18,744 --> 00:16:21,110
You'll find comfort there.

355
00:16:23,515 --> 00:16:24,846
Yeah, go ahead.

356
00:16:24,917 --> 00:16:26,509
KAREN: Let's go pray.

357
00:16:39,798 --> 00:16:41,595
(MONITOR BEEPING STEADILY)

358
00:16:42,401 --> 00:16:44,801
She is doing fine.

359
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:46,462
Those chairs will kill your back.

360
00:16:46,538 --> 00:16:48,802
You should go home and get some rest.

361
00:16:49,742 --> 00:16:51,039
I can't.

362
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:54,477
I can't go home alone
when she's like this.

363
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:57,778
Thought I'd just stay and read.

364
00:16:57,850 --> 00:16:59,841
Okay. That's fine.

365
00:16:59,918 --> 00:17:01,408
But I can't read either.

366
00:17:02,921 --> 00:17:05,082
Can't concentrate.

367
00:17:05,157 --> 00:17:07,717
It's odd. I've never had that problem.

368
00:17:08,927 --> 00:17:12,829
I think it's because
I don't know where she is.

369
00:17:14,099 --> 00:17:16,590
I always know where she is.

370
00:17:16,668 --> 00:17:17,726
She's right here.

371
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:20,972
It's just as if she's asleep
in the bed next to you.

372
00:17:22,508 --> 00:17:23,532
Not really.

373
00:17:25,177 --> 00:17:26,940
Because she might not wake up.

374
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:30,015
I feel like...

375
00:17:30,082 --> 00:17:33,245
Like she's sailed away
and I don't know if she's coming back.

376
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:35,782
That's the feeling, you know?

377
00:17:37,423 --> 00:17:40,654
Michael, we are working
very hard to solve this.

378
00:17:40,726 --> 00:17:42,250
I know.

379
00:17:42,327 --> 00:17:43,794
I know. I just...

380
00:17:45,064 --> 00:17:46,395
I just want her to come back.

381
00:17:48,734 --> 00:17:50,998
I do, too.

382
00:17:53,105 --> 00:17:55,266
This HLHS case seems impossible.

383
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:56,534
This mother's pregnant
for the third time,

384
00:17:56,608 --> 00:17:58,041
and each baby was stillborn.

385
00:17:58,110 --> 00:17:59,737
Well, this one will be, too.

386
00:17:59,812 --> 00:18:01,245
22q11 deletion?

387
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:03,142
She should adopt.

388
00:18:04,349 --> 00:18:05,976
Now this one, however...

389
00:18:06,051 --> 00:18:09,987
Tracheal balloon occlusion for CDH?
Card that puppy.

390
00:18:10,789 --> 00:18:13,815
How do you do this without...
I mean, these stories are awful.

391
00:18:13,892 --> 00:18:15,484
They're patients, Robbins.

392
00:18:15,561 --> 00:18:18,655
The more you find, the more you learn,
the more we save.

393
00:18:18,730 --> 00:18:20,095
It's as simple as that.

394
00:18:20,165 --> 00:18:22,656
Your work is making
these three categories,

395
00:18:22,734 --> 00:18:25,100
possible, impossible, maybe.

396
00:18:25,404 --> 00:18:27,964
Any other approach
is a waste of our time.

397
00:18:28,941 --> 00:18:30,238

(BOTH CHUCKLE)

400
00:18:36,381 --> 00:18:37,848
Oh, wow.

401
00:18:39,551 --> 00:18:41,485
Holy crap. (GASPS) It's fate!

402
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:45,090
Look! It's your sexy tech rep!
Your sexy tech rep!

403
00:18:45,157 --> 00:18:47,182
She's not my sexy anything.

404
00:18:47,259 --> 00:18:48,954
Not yet, but she could be.

405
00:18:49,027 --> 00:18:53,327
(LAUGHS) I came out tonight with you
to unwind, not to...

406
00:18:53,398 --> 00:18:55,866
And she's a tech rep.
That's a conflict of interest.

407
00:18:55,934 --> 00:18:57,526
- Not if we don't buy her transducers.
- Mmm.

408
00:18:57,603 --> 00:18:59,161
They're junk, anyway.

409
00:18:59,238 --> 00:19:01,638
Come on! You gotta get back
in the saddle.

410
00:19:02,774 --> 00:19:05,709
- And she's got a nice saddle.
- Oh, yeah. (CHUCKLES)

411
00:19:05,777 --> 00:19:07,301
What? Whoa, what are you doing?

412
00:19:09,848 --> 00:19:12,908
Okay, so listen,
I'm not really great at this kind of thing,

413
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:14,282
so I'm just gonna blurt it out.

414
00:19:14,353 --> 00:19:17,186
I think that you were interested
in more than just our program today.

415
00:19:17,256 --> 00:19:18,518
Oh, you picked up on that?

416
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:20,455
I was right! (LAUGHS)

417
00:19:20,526 --> 00:19:23,359
I knew it! Okay. So this should be easy.

418
00:19:23,428 --> 00:19:26,659
Owen is a little bit shy,
but he's a great guy.

419
00:19:26,732 --> 00:19:29,200
And the feeling's mutual.

420
00:19:29,735 --> 00:19:30,793
So...

421
00:19:33,005 --> 00:19:34,029
So what do you say?

422
00:19:35,073 --> 00:19:37,371
I would say that
there's something about him

423
00:19:37,442 --> 00:19:40,240
that doesn't quite feel like he's my type.

424
00:19:40,646 --> 00:19:42,409
What? No! He's...

425
00:19:42,481 --> 00:19:45,211
He's very attractive. He's nice.
He's funny.

426
00:19:45,284 --> 00:19:47,514
People like funny, right?
I mean, come on. Give him a chance.

427
00:19:47,586 --> 00:19:48,712
What about him isn't your type?

428
00:19:49,788 --> 00:19:50,812
He has a penis.

429
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:53,658
Oh!

430
00:19:54,693 --> 00:19:55,955
Oh...

431
00:19:56,562 --> 00:19:57,722
Oh.

432
00:19:58,230 --> 00:20:00,323
Wait. No. You were...

433
00:20:00,399 --> 00:20:01,559
(SIGHS)

434
00:20:01,633 --> 00:20:03,863
- You were flirty.
- I was.

435
00:20:03,936 --> 00:20:05,904
But not with him.

436
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:10,301
Oh. (CHUCKLES UNCOMFORTABLY)

437
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:11,535
Um...

438
00:20:12,311 --> 00:20:13,335
Wow.

439
00:20:13,412 --> 00:20:17,678
I am wildly saddened by
my intense lack of game right now.

440
00:20:17,749 --> 00:20:18,943
I can't believe I didn't see that coming.

441
00:20:19,017 --> 00:20:20,279
There was a time
when I would've been all,

442
00:20:20,352 --> 00:20:21,410
"That's right. I know it's me."

443
00:20:21,486 --> 00:20:23,545
But right now, I'm just like...

444
00:20:24,022 --> 00:20:26,115
Uh... (LAUGHS)

445
00:20:26,191 --> 00:20:28,318

You are gorgeous, by the way.

447

Do people just tell you that all the time?
Because you are gorgeous.

448
00:20:32,931 --> 00:20:34,558
No, I'm not.

449
00:20:34,633 --> 00:20:37,659
Am I? No. Am I?

450
00:20:38,904 --> 00:20:40,269
No. Wait. No, no. Wait, wait.

451
00:20:40,339 --> 00:20:41,738
Stop. Stop, stop, stop, stop.

452
00:20:42,741 --> 00:20:44,971
- Not into women?
- No, no, no. I am, totally.

453
00:20:45,043 --> 00:20:47,705
Women. Men. People, really.
I'm just, I'm just, I'm just...

454
00:20:47,779 --> 00:20:49,337
I'm just not really shopping right now.

455
00:20:49,414 --> 00:20:51,109
I'm divorced.

456
00:20:51,683 --> 00:20:56,313
And it was recent and painful
and brutal.

457
00:20:56,388 --> 00:20:57,980
Brutal, actually.

458
00:20:58,824 --> 00:21:02,453
Well, if you wanna forget
for just a little while,

459
00:21:02,561 --> 00:21:04,529
I fly out tomorrow.

460
00:21:04,596 --> 00:21:06,894
Doesn't have to be anything more
than one night.

461
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:10,565
I would love...

462
00:21:12,037 --> 00:21:13,834
I would love to love that.
I'm just not ready.

463
00:21:13,905 --> 00:21:15,270
I'm so sorry.

464
00:21:20,846 --> 00:21:21,835
Uh...

465
00:21:26,218 --> 00:21:27,344
(KNOCKING)

466
00:21:27,419 --> 00:21:28,818
- Hi, guys.
- Hi.

467
00:21:28,887 --> 00:21:31,685
- You're here late.
- Well, we're on a timeline.

468
00:21:31,757 --> 00:21:34,157
I was taking a look at Dr. Wall's notes,

469
00:21:34,226 --> 00:21:35,887
and I found
some contradictory information.

470
00:21:35,961 --> 00:21:37,360
He was the second opinion?

471
00:21:38,363 --> 00:21:40,729
- Wall is where?
- Case Western.

472
00:21:40,999 --> 00:21:43,058
Uh, he was third. He's radiation.

473
00:21:43,135 --> 00:21:45,501
Right. Just getting my dates straight.

474
00:21:46,171 --> 00:21:48,935
- What are all these?
- Cases. Fetuses.

475
00:21:49,174 --> 00:21:52,473
Each card represents a fetus
that I'm gonna teach Robbins how to fix.

in the time I have.

477
00:21:57,049 --> 00:21:59,142
- And those?
- These?

478
00:21:59,217 --> 00:22:02,448
No. These are the ones
that I could save,

479
00:22:02,521 --> 00:22:04,489
if I had time.

480
00:22:04,556 --> 00:22:07,457
You should just think of them
as babies who will die

00:22:07,526 --> 00:22:10,586
if it turns out that you're full of crap
and can't take out my tumor.

482
00:22:11,797 --> 00:22:12,786
Oh.

483
00:22:13,198 --> 00:22:15,928
- No pressure.
- Oh, no. Pressure.

00:22:50,168 --> 00:22:52,466
practicing for their service
tomorrow night.

00:22:52,537 --> 00:22:54,835
Really beautiful. We should all go to it.

497
00:22:54,906 --> 00:22:59,036
I don't think we'll know
what we'll be up for tomorrow, Karen.

498
00:22:59,678 --> 00:23:01,612
Because of the test results?

499
00:23:02,514 --> 00:23:05,677
April told me about the test,
and I told her

500
00:23:05,751 --> 00:23:08,549
there's really no point
in even getting those results.

501
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:11,612
- Excuse me?
- God gives what he wants to give.

502
00:23:11,690 --> 00:23:13,885
No test is going to change that.

503
00:23:14,393 --> 00:23:17,191
And April's already so upset,
so stressed.

504
00:23:17,262 --> 00:23:18,820
It's not good for the baby.

505
00:23:18,897 --> 00:23:22,424
Just focus on loving
that sweet little baby.

506
00:23:22,501 --> 00:23:24,162
That's all that matters.

507
00:23:24,236 --> 00:23:26,636
No, that's definitely not all that matters.

508
00:23:26,705 --> 00:23:29,538
I know, it's hard
to understand sometimes

509
00:23:29,608 --> 00:23:31,303
how His plan will unfold.

00:23:31,376 --> 00:23:33,401
Yeah, but I'm not worried
about His plan, am I?

511
00:23:33,478 --> 00:23:34,536
I'm worried about our plan.

512
00:23:34,613 --> 00:23:36,706
He never gives us
more than we can handle.

00:23:36,782 --> 00:23:38,147
Getting the results,

514
00:23:38,216 --> 00:23:39,843
being informed about
our baby's condition,

515
00:23:39,918 --> 00:23:41,044
that's how we handle it.

516
00:23:41,119 --> 00:23:42,814
I called our pastor at home.

517
00:23:42,888 --> 00:23:45,083
April spoke to him at length.
He was very helpful.

00:23:46,625 --> 00:23:48,786
Me. Let me help you.

we will shoulder the burden

521
00:23:50,896 --> 00:23:52,056
when it is placed upon us.

522
00:23:52,130 --> 00:23:54,223
We will. You and I.
We'll shoulder the burden.

Is she, though? Really? Is she helping?

525

Don't snap at her.

526
00:24:00,505 --> 00:24:01,870
- Don't talk to her in that tone.
- What tone?

527
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:03,635
I'm not talking using a tone.
I'm trying to understand.

528
00:24:03,708 --> 00:24:05,300

529
00:24:05,377 --> 00:24:07,868
into doing something
she knows in her heart and soul

530
00:24:07,946 --> 00:24:09,140
she does not want to do.

531
00:24:09,214 --> 00:24:10,511
JACKSON: I'm not trying to
talk her into anything.

make the best choice possible

And if you think she is going to agree

536
00:24:19,224 --> 00:24:21,124
- to abort her child...
- Our child!

537
00:24:21,193 --> 00:24:22,717
- You are...
- Get that straight. It's our child.

538
00:24:22,794 --> 00:24:25,228
Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!

00:24:25,297 --> 00:24:27,629
None of this is helping!

00:24:27,699 --> 00:24:29,690
You are not helping, neither of you.

541
00:24:29,768 --> 00:24:31,531
I am standing here,
listening to you tell me

542
00:24:31,603 --> 00:24:32,934
that God only gives me one choice,

543
00:24:33,004 --> 00:24:35,632
and you telling me that I should
forgo God's choice.

544
00:24:35,707 --> 00:24:37,971
And the truth is, I don't know anything

545
00:24:38,043 --> 00:24:42,275
expect that I am scared and sad
and I'm alone.

546

You're both just standing there,
yelling at each other and talking at me,

But I am alone, and it is terrifying!

548
00:24:49,988 --> 00:24:52,684
And the louder you get,
the more terrified I become,

549
00:24:52,757 --> 00:24:56,090
so I just need you both to just shut up!

550
00:24:57,295 --> 00:24:59,820
Can you... Can you do that?

551
00:24:59,898 --> 00:25:03,994

both just shut up?

Visibility is not my problem.

I can see my tumor
in all its problematic glory,

Derek lives in DC.

No, I'm saying if they ask you,
make up something about being on call.

I was on call twice a week.

sleep, and then come back.

Someone has to stay
in case the printer crashes.

Plus, I don't mind. I like the sound.
It's kinda soothing.

You don't.

586
00:26:50,675 --> 00:26:53,906
I mean, before three months ago,
any time I called your house

587
00:26:53,979 --> 00:26:56,504
or came over or Skyped or whatever,

588
00:26:56,581 --> 00:26:57,878
Cristina was there.

589
00:26:57,949 --> 00:26:59,883
There's no way you ever slept alone.
I mean, you had Derek.

590
00:26:59,951 --> 00:27:01,441
And if you didn't have Derek,
you had Cristina.

00:27:01,519 --> 00:27:03,419
I'm guessing if it came down to it,

592
00:27:03,488 --> 00:27:05,388
you were, like, the middle spoon

593
00:27:05,457 --> 00:27:09,018
in the middle of
a very weird spooning situation.

than you used...

He's lucky I love him.

00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:38,979
And he's a resident
and hardly home at night.

the arm thrown over your waist.

When I'd wake up at night,
terrified of me,

608
00:27:59,077 --> 00:28:00,942
I liked knowing he was there

609
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:03,543

Dean just loved to spoon and snuggle,

615
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:24,598
and I would just lie there,

616
00:28:25,670 --> 00:28:27,331
staring up silently,

617
00:28:27,405 --> 00:28:29,703
counting the seconds
until he would fall asleep

618
00:28:29,774 --> 00:28:31,901
and I could sneak off
to sleep on the sofa.

619
00:28:31,976 --> 00:28:33,102
And then I'd sneak back into bed

It's not a cute story.

00:28:38,149 --> 00:28:40,310

00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:50,693
He's funny.

627
00:28:51,796 --> 00:28:53,889
So when he proposed,

628
00:28:53,965 --> 00:28:56,525
I explained to him about the sleeping.

629
00:28:56,601 --> 00:28:57,761
I said,

630
00:28:57,836 --> 00:29:01,101
"Maybe you could sleep in a room
down the hall."

631
00:29:01,172 --> 00:29:02,969
I wanted to sleep alone.

632
00:29:04,409 --> 00:29:05,535
And what happened?

633
00:29:06,277 --> 00:29:09,405
He is now married to someone
who loves to spoon and snuggle.

635
00:29:11,349 --> 00:29:13,544
And I sleep like a baby every night.

636
00:29:16,221 --> 00:29:18,519
I might be too good at being alone.

637
00:29:27,899 --> 00:29:30,595
Maybe I could print a Derek.

638
00:29:32,937 --> 00:29:34,666

Okay, hit me. What's next?

644
00:30:25,523 --> 00:30:27,957
I think we can divide the diaphragm

645
00:30:28,026 --> 00:30:31,359
to resect the pericardial component
of the tumor.

646
00:30:31,429 --> 00:30:32,691
MAGGIE: But carefully.

647
00:30:32,764 --> 00:30:34,959
We'll need to dissect
two to three centimeters

648
00:30:35,033 --> 00:30:38,332
proximal to the IVC first to control flow.

649
00:30:38,403 --> 00:30:39,870
Yep, and then we can clamp

650
00:30:39,938 --> 00:30:43,271
and create
the veno-venous bypass flap.

651
00:30:43,341 --> 00:30:45,366
You sure you don't wanna do
a sternotomy?

652
00:30:45,443 --> 00:30:47,377
Now you have something to say?
Where were you yesterday?

653
00:30:47,445 --> 00:30:49,379
- You should've showed me this.
- Karev, what's your point?

654
00:30:49,447 --> 00:30:51,210
Well, I would do McGinn's technique

655
00:30:51,282 --> 00:30:53,341
to access the chest
with less invasiveness

656
00:30:53,418 --> 00:30:56,182
to avoid diaphragmatic hernia
postradiation.

657
00:30:57,555 --> 00:31:00,217
- He's got a point.
- Back to the beginning.

right here.

659
00:31:20,345 --> 00:31:24,372
Okay, that's what, like five centimeters
superior to the renal vein?

660
00:31:24,449 --> 00:31:25,473
Okay, but stop.

661
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:28,849
- Close your eyes and just feel.
- Okay.

662
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:32,356
Because all we have to go on
is muscle memory.

of the hepatic veins.

- Bailey, can you feel me?
- Yeah, I'm right behind you.

673
00:32:14,332 --> 00:32:17,233
I can feel the edge
of the lesser omentum.

674
00:32:17,302 --> 00:32:20,999
I think that gives me enough space
to control the porta hepatis.

Yes. Yes. I can palpate a good window.
