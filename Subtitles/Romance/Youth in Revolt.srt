00:00:41,421 --> 00:00:43,480
<i>My name is Nick.</i>

2
00:00:43,657 --> 00:00:46,649
<i>My last name, which l loathe,
is Twisp.</i>

3
00:00:46,827 --> 00:00:48,192
<i>Which would be a nice name...</i>

4
00:00:48,362 --> 00:00:51,559
<i>...if l planned on becoming
an evil nurse in a mental institution.</i>

5
00:00:52,866 --> 00:00:55,198
<i>l am a voracious reader
of classic prose...</i>

6
00:00:55,369 --> 00:00:57,030
<i>...an aspiring novelist...</i>

7
00:00:57,204 --> 00:00:59,399
<i>...and feel the world would be
a better place...</i>

8
00:00:59,573 --> 00:01:02,804
<i>...if every radio station played
Sinatra's ''My One and Only Love''...</i>

9
00:01:02,976 --> 00:01:04,238
<i>...at least once an hour.</i>

10
00:01:04,411 --> 00:01:06,174
<i>Needless to say, l'm still a virgin.</i>

11
00:01:09,182 --> 00:01:11,173
<i>l live in Oakland
with my charming mother.</i>

12
00:01:12,886 --> 00:01:14,979
<i>-Estelle....
-Her latest boyfriend, Jerry...</i>

13
00:01:15,155 --> 00:01:17,180
<i>...is a truck driver
and pathological liar.</i>

14
00:01:17,357 --> 00:01:20,383
lf a woman answered the phone,
it was probably just the maid.

15
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:22,528
<i>He's a real prize.</i>

16
00:01:22,829 --> 00:01:24,888
l'm going to bite you.

17
00:01:25,065 --> 00:01:26,498
No.

18
00:01:28,268 --> 00:01:29,963
-Hi, Nick.
-Hi.

19
00:01:30,137 --> 00:01:32,731
-Have three more for you.
-Oh, thanks, Mr. Ferguson.

20
00:01:32,906 --> 00:01:36,433
<i>Our neighbour Mr. Ferguson likes to
bring us mail from our mailbox.</i>

21
00:01:36,610 --> 00:01:40,341
<i>He's a former activist with
a bleeding heart and too much time.</i>

22
00:01:40,514 --> 00:01:43,005
<i>He's always getting arrested
for staging protests...</i>

23
00:01:43,183 --> 00:01:45,413
<i>...and harbouring illegal aliens
in his basement.</i>

24
00:01:45,585 --> 00:01:48,611
<i>He's a good man, but very strange.</i>

25
00:01:51,091 --> 00:01:52,991
<i>My dad is currently in between jobs.</i>

26
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:55,128
<i>He would love
to not have to work at all...</i>

27
00:01:55,295 --> 00:01:58,264
<i>...but he's burdened with crippling
child-support payments.</i>

28
00:01:58,432 --> 00:02:00,423
When am l going to start getting
an allowance?

29
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:02,727
l'm getting tired of not having
a cell phone.

30
00:02:02,903 --> 00:02:05,770
l'm afraid you're going to have to
work it out with your mom.

31
00:02:05,939 --> 00:02:08,430
<i>-Lacy is Dad's girlfriend.
-Baby...</i>

32
00:02:08,608 --> 00:02:10,838
...l cooked for you.

33
00:02:11,011 --> 00:02:12,638
-You made me a snack.
-Come here.

34
00:02:12,813 --> 00:02:15,611
<i>She's 25
and a budding cosmetologist.</i>

35
00:02:15,782 --> 00:02:18,683
-l love it.
-Does my baby like it?

36
00:02:18,852 --> 00:02:21,582
<i>it’s amazing
and incredibly irritating to me...</i>

37
00:02:21,755 --> 00:02:24,918
<i>...how much action everyone
around me seems to be getting.</i>

38
00:02:26,159 --> 00:02:27,490
<i>With one exception.</i>

39
00:02:27,661 --> 00:02:30,425
My sister saw Millie holding hands
with some college guy.

40
00:02:30,597 --> 00:02:34,624
<i>My friend Lefty's had a crush on a girl
named Millie Filbert since third grade.</i>

41
00:02:34,801 --> 00:02:37,201
<i>He's the only person
more miserable than l am.</i>

42
00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:41,534
You know, l've been taping my dick
to my right leg at night with duct tape.

43
00:02:41,708 --> 00:02:43,938
l think of Millie
in her green summery dress...

44
00:02:44,110 --> 00:02:46,670
...and l get hard.
it starts to push against the tape--

45
00:02:46,847 --> 00:02:49,213
Putting counter-rotational
tension on the shaft.

46
00:02:49,382 --> 00:02:50,508
-Right.
-That's nice.

47
00:02:50,684 --> 00:02:53,016
<i>in case you haven't heard,
Lefty's erect member...</i>

48
00:02:53,186 --> 00:02:56,417
<i>...takes a sudden and dramatic turn
to the east about midway up.</i>

49
00:02:56,590 --> 00:02:58,683
-War.
-Well, you might want to get it fixed...

50
00:02:58,859 --> 00:03:00,486
...before you ask Millie out.

51
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:02,150
That's very true.

52
00:03:02,329 --> 00:03:04,627
What if l shove it up the wrong hole?

53
00:03:04,798 --> 00:03:07,733
What if we go out
and she doesn't even like me?

54
00:03:07,901 --> 00:03:09,926
We get to know each other
and she hates me?

55
00:03:10,103 --> 00:03:11,661
We get married and have a kid...

56
00:03:11,838 --> 00:03:14,932
...but he's not good at anything,
has no talents?

57
00:03:16,710 --> 00:03:18,541
l wonder if it's worth it.

58
00:03:19,613 --> 00:03:23,014
Either way, you probably want to
get your dick straightened out.

59
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:28,811
-is Jerry here?
-He just went out.

60
00:03:28,989 --> 00:03:30,718
That hunk-of-shit Chevy he sold us...

61
00:03:30,891 --> 00:03:33,018
...made it 1 7 miles
before the engine blew up.

62
00:03:33,193 --> 00:03:35,684
And we found evidence of a banana
in the transmission.

63
00:03:35,862 --> 00:03:37,489
So he owes us $900.

64
00:03:37,664 --> 00:03:41,395
Well, l'm quite certain that he spent
that $900 on his new Lincoln.

65
00:03:41,568 --> 00:03:45,004
Maybe you'd better come back
and speak with him directly.

66
00:03:45,171 --> 00:03:48,163
He's a pretty stubborn man,
so you might have to get physical.

67
00:03:48,341 --> 00:03:49,365
That can be arranged.

68
00:03:50,844 --> 00:03:52,869
<i>After living in Oakland
for 1 6 years...</i>

69
00:03:53,046 --> 00:03:56,243
<i>...l've noticed it's filled with women
who have zero interest in me.</i>

70
00:03:56,416 --> 00:03:57,747
Hey, Karen.

71
00:03:57,918 --> 00:03:59,180
Nick.

72
00:03:59,352 --> 00:04:01,912
Oh, right. Physics?

73
00:04:02,088 --> 00:04:04,056
American History. You were close.

74
00:04:04,925 --> 00:04:06,256
What is that?

75
00:04:06,426 --> 00:04:09,088
<i>Oh, La Estrada. it’s a Fellini movie.</i>

76
00:04:09,262 --> 00:04:11,526
So random.

77
00:04:11,698 --> 00:04:14,963
<i>They were out of Miss Congeniality 2:
Armed and Fabulous...</i>

78
00:04:15,135 --> 00:04:16,932
...so l went for a random--

79
00:04:17,103 --> 00:04:20,903
-Chad. Fuck you.
-Oh, fuck you, you love it.

80
00:04:21,074 --> 00:04:24,305
Hey, does that movie come with
tampons for your pussy?

81
00:04:24,477 --> 00:04:27,412
You know, Chad,
l'll be upset if it doesn't.

82
00:04:29,549 --> 00:04:31,710
<i>in the movies,
the good guy gets the girl.</i>

83
00:04:31,885 --> 00:04:34,217
<i>in real life it's usually the prick.</i>

84
00:04:34,387 --> 00:04:35,649
Nick, get out here.

85
00:04:37,490 --> 00:04:38,718
Nick.

86
00:04:39,059 --> 00:04:40,617
Nick.

87
00:04:42,095 --> 00:04:44,928
Nick, do you know anything
about this?

88
00:04:45,098 --> 00:04:48,033
Oh, yeah. Those sailors came by.
They want their money back.

89
00:04:48,201 --> 00:04:51,432
Apparently there was some sort of
banana in the transmission.

90
00:04:54,674 --> 00:04:56,505
You tell them l was coming back?

91
00:04:56,676 --> 00:04:58,769
Now, why would l do that?

92
00:04:59,512 --> 00:05:01,241
Jerry, what are you going to do?

93
00:05:01,414 --> 00:05:02,847
Go get the Lincoln washed.

94
00:05:03,016 --> 00:05:04,574
You're leaving?

95
00:05:04,751 --> 00:05:07,720
What happens when
that sailor comes back?

96
00:05:08,288 --> 00:05:10,483
<i>To escape the threat
of ill-tempered sailors...</i>

97
00:05:10,657 --> 00:05:12,648
<i>...we're going to Clear Lake
for a week...</i>

98
00:05:12,826 --> 00:05:15,226
<i>...to stay in a cabin owned by
a friend of Jerry's.</i>

99
00:05:15,395 --> 00:05:19,229
<i>Since l have no life,
l figure l have nothing to lose.</i>

100
00:05:22,569 --> 00:05:24,469
We're going on vacation.

101
00:07:13,046 --> 00:07:14,809
Jerry.

102
00:07:14,981 --> 00:07:17,643
l thought you said it was a cabin.

103
00:07:19,018 --> 00:07:21,714
Come on, Estelle.
it’s real cute on the inside.

104
00:07:40,507 --> 00:07:42,907
l say we let the kid do the dishes...

105
00:07:43,076 --> 00:07:45,772
...and you and l
retire to the master bedroom.

106
00:07:55,155 --> 00:07:57,282
Do you think Jerry is
someone that l can...

107
00:07:57,457 --> 00:07:59,925
...look forward to having around
for years to come?

108
00:08:00,093 --> 00:08:03,654
Nick, how many men are interested
in a woman who's 48 years old...

109
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:06,458
...has a kid, no money
and stretch marks?

110
00:08:06,633 --> 00:08:08,931
l think you're selling yourself short,
Mom.

111
00:08:09,102 --> 00:08:11,935
Leave open the possibility
of a stretch-mark fetishist.

112
00:08:12,105 --> 00:08:14,471
Oh, watch your smart mouth.

113
00:08:19,045 --> 00:08:22,071
So you're going to do the dishes,
okay, hon.?

114
00:08:22,248 --> 00:08:24,944
Gerald and l will be in back,
playing Scrabble.

115
00:08:58,618 --> 00:09:00,142
Your robe's open.

116
00:09:31,117 --> 00:09:33,950
-So are you staying near here?
-We live down the block.

117
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:36,111
Oh, spitting distance.

118
00:09:36,289 --> 00:09:37,756
So to speak.

119
00:09:39,192 --> 00:09:40,523
Hi, Stuck-up.

120
00:09:40,693 --> 00:09:43,685
-Hi.
-Honey, this is sheeni Saunders.

121
00:09:43,863 --> 00:09:46,627
She stopped by to introduce herself.
isn’t that neighbourly?

122
00:09:47,267 --> 00:09:49,861
-Yes. Yes.
-She's on her way to the store.

123
00:09:50,036 --> 00:09:52,095
l volunteered your help
carrying her bags.

124
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:55,569
Sounds fun.

125
00:09:58,378 --> 00:10:00,039
You know, your family's arrival...

126
00:10:00,213 --> 00:10:02,977
...excited considerable interest
among the residents.

127
00:10:03,516 --> 00:10:06,849
-Your father's beer cooler on the--
-Oh, no, he's not my father.

128
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:08,578
Jerry's my mother's consort.

129
00:10:08,755 --> 00:10:11,349
He and l
have no blood links of any kind.

130
00:10:12,558 --> 00:10:15,186
Well, that seems to be
worth something.

131
00:10:20,433 --> 00:10:22,663
<i>Yesterday the most exciting thing
in my life...</i>

132
00:10:22,835 --> 00:10:26,532
<i>...was the thought of Jerry being
beaten senseless by three sailors.</i>

133
00:10:26,706 --> 00:10:30,506
<i>Now l'm spending time
with a beautiful, interesting girl...</i>

134
00:10:30,677 --> 00:10:32,440
<i>...and l have no idea
how it happened.</i>

135
00:10:32,612 --> 00:10:34,307
Here we are.

136
00:10:35,615 --> 00:10:37,242
Wow, a second floor.

137
00:10:37,417 --> 00:10:40,386
Yes. Father bought it so we could
look down on the world.

138
00:10:40,553 --> 00:10:41,986
What does your father do?

139
00:10:42,155 --> 00:10:43,747
He's a lawyer.

140
00:10:45,491 --> 00:10:47,686
Wow, this is really nice.

141
00:10:56,703 --> 00:10:59,399
-Where are your parents?
-They're at church.

142
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:02,971
Would you like a tour?

143
00:11:03,142 --> 00:11:04,666
Sure.

144
00:11:05,144 --> 00:11:06,668
Kitchen.

145
00:11:07,847 --> 00:11:10,372
This is Mother's Farfisa organ.

146
00:11:11,417 --> 00:11:15,547
Father added this extension
so he could fit these 64 pipes in.

147
00:11:19,258 --> 00:11:21,055
Dining room.

148
00:11:22,595 --> 00:11:24,825
Here's a family portrait.

149
00:11:29,669 --> 00:11:32,263
And this is my room.

150
00:11:42,982 --> 00:11:44,745
<i>Didn't you just love Breathless?</i>

151
00:11:45,351 --> 00:11:47,216
Jean-Paul was completely gripping.

152
00:11:47,653 --> 00:11:50,019
lf you like French people, l suppose.
Yeah.

153
00:11:50,456 --> 00:11:52,253
l can see it.

154
00:11:52,425 --> 00:11:54,416
<i>l think my favourite film
was Tokyo Story.</i>

155
00:11:54,594 --> 00:11:56,824
l just think Mizoguchi
is a great director.

156
00:11:56,996 --> 00:11:59,055
it’s a great film.

157
00:11:59,332 --> 00:12:01,095
But wasn't that by Ozu?

158
00:12:05,505 --> 00:12:06,904
Who can say?

159
00:12:10,977 --> 00:12:13,343
There's nothing quite as good
as vinyl.

160
00:12:13,513 --> 00:12:15,845
Yeah, it's very textural.

161
00:12:18,818 --> 00:12:21,753
-Do you like Frank Sinatra?
-l do.

162
00:12:22,288 --> 00:12:25,155
But my all-time favourite is...

163
00:12:25,758 --> 00:12:28,352
...Serge Ginsburg.

164
00:12:29,796 --> 00:12:31,855
So you really like the French,
don't you?

165
00:12:32,031 --> 00:12:33,623
l want to live in France.

166
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:36,200
l want to live all over the world.

167
00:12:36,636 --> 00:12:39,605
l know there's so much more
than this out there.

168
00:12:42,708 --> 00:12:45,302
My parents are religious fanatics.

169
00:12:46,479 --> 00:12:48,242
They're exhausting.

170
00:12:58,124 --> 00:13:00,820
-Bye.
-Bye.

171
00:13:06,899 --> 00:13:08,423
Hey, sheeni?

172
00:13:08,935 --> 00:13:12,769
Do you think you'd like to join me
at the beach tomorrow after breakfast?

173
00:13:13,172 --> 00:13:14,730
l'd love to.

174
00:13:31,791 --> 00:13:33,520
-Yes?
-Hello, Mr. Saunders. l'm Nick.

175
00:13:33,693 --> 00:13:35,718
l'm here to see sheeni.

176
00:13:36,996 --> 00:13:39,328
l understand you've invited her
to the beach.

177
00:13:39,499 --> 00:13:40,989
That's right.

178
00:13:42,201 --> 00:13:44,692
Well, l trust, sir,
you are aware that in doing so...

179
00:13:44,871 --> 00:13:46,930
...you have entered into
an oral contract...

180
00:13:47,106 --> 00:13:48,664
...to perform in loco parentis...

181
00:13:48,841 --> 00:13:51,969
...i.e., to provide for
the safety and welfare...

182
00:13:52,145 --> 00:13:55,308
...of aforementioned minor female.

183
00:13:58,184 --> 00:14:00,880
-Ready?
-Very ready.

184
00:14:02,088 --> 00:14:03,612
Bye, Father.

185
00:14:03,789 --> 00:14:05,780
Goodbye, Mr. Saunders.

186
00:14:08,027 --> 00:14:11,258
Would you mind applying this
to my exposed areas?

187
00:14:11,931 --> 00:14:13,455
Sure.

188
00:14:44,931 --> 00:14:46,990
You get turned on easily.

189
00:14:49,168 --> 00:14:51,898
Don't stop, Nick. it’s only natural.

190
00:14:52,872 --> 00:14:55,807
Girls are fortunate
in that it doesn't show.

191
00:14:55,975 --> 00:14:57,203
For all the world knows...

192
00:14:57,376 --> 00:15:00,106
...my vagina could be moist
with desire as we speak.

193
00:15:01,314 --> 00:15:02,872
is it?

194
00:15:06,686 --> 00:15:08,119
Should we do my front now?

195
00:15:08,888 --> 00:15:10,287
Okay.

196
00:15:10,456 --> 00:15:12,185
l'm up for it.

197
00:15:32,144 --> 00:15:33,702
Thank you.

198
00:15:46,192 --> 00:15:48,092
What's your last name?

199
00:15:48,794 --> 00:15:50,386
Dillinger.

200
00:15:56,269 --> 00:15:57,896
Twisp.

201
00:16:05,578 --> 00:16:07,011
<i>sheeni Saunders.</i>

202
00:16:07,613 --> 00:16:11,276
<i>She's complicated, mischievous
and at this point...</i>

203
00:16:11,450 --> 00:16:14,783
<i>...l'd be willing to give up
everything in my life to be with her.</i>

204
00:16:17,323 --> 00:16:21,521
Nick, you're very nice,
but l should tell you l have a boyfriend.

205
00:16:22,228 --> 00:16:23,525
Oh, l see.

206
00:16:23,963 --> 00:16:25,590
His name is Trent.

207
00:16:25,765 --> 00:16:28,791
We've been together
for a while, actually.

208
00:16:29,702 --> 00:16:31,294
What's he like?

209
00:16:31,570 --> 00:16:33,333
He's 1 7...

210
00:16:33,506 --> 00:16:35,997
...6'2'', fluent in French...

211
00:16:36,175 --> 00:16:39,633
...plays the piano,
is a champion swimmer...

212
00:16:39,812 --> 00:16:42,906
...and writes futurist
percussive poetry.

213
00:16:43,316 --> 00:16:46,808
Oh, l'm not familiar with
futurist percussive poems.

214
00:16:46,986 --> 00:16:49,750
l could recite one of Trent's,
if you'd like.

215
00:16:49,922 --> 00:16:51,446
Please do.

216
00:16:53,025 --> 00:16:54,959
<i>Ram dam 1 2</i>

217
00:16:55,127 --> 00:16:56,458
<i>Sizzle mop</i>

218
00:16:56,896 --> 00:16:58,386
<i>Crunch down</i>

219
00:16:58,564 --> 00:17:00,395
<i>Safety net</i>

220
00:17:00,566 --> 00:17:03,763
<i>Hot, hot, hot
Void</i>

221
00:17:06,906 --> 00:17:08,999
Well, that certainly sounds like
a poem.

222
00:17:09,175 --> 00:17:11,143
Jeez, he sounds great.

223
00:17:11,477 --> 00:17:14,503
Well, you know, l also have
a sweetheart for the moment, so....

224
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:17,240
Really? What's her name?

225
00:17:17,416 --> 00:17:20,852
Her name is Martha Sing wall.
She's 1 6.

226
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:23,318
She's got toasted almond hair, so....

227
00:17:23,489 --> 00:17:26,720
She's only just recently returned
from Nice...

228
00:17:26,892 --> 00:17:29,793
...where she's been conducting
sociological research...

229
00:17:29,962 --> 00:17:33,693
...on the assimilation problems
of Italian immigrant workers...

230
00:17:33,866 --> 00:17:35,060
...down there.

231
00:17:35,234 --> 00:17:38,965
She's also a professional model
that specializes in lingerie.

232
00:17:39,138 --> 00:17:42,232
She likes me quite a bit.
She tells me that she loves my hair.

233
00:17:44,043 --> 00:17:47,376
-She sounds wonderful.
-Yes, l think you'd like her, sheeni.

234
00:17:47,546 --> 00:17:50,845
Trent sounds great, too,
aside from being freakishly tall.

235
00:17:51,016 --> 00:17:53,644
He certainly does seem to have
a knack for...

236
00:17:53,819 --> 00:17:56,811
...smashing ungraceful words
together...

237
00:17:57,289 --> 00:17:59,018
...and deeming it a poem.

238
00:18:00,393 --> 00:18:02,793
Well, thanks for a lovely day, Nick.

239
00:18:02,962 --> 00:18:04,589
Don't mention it.

240
00:18:06,365 --> 00:18:09,857
<i>l think of this girl being swept away
by some pretentious poet...</i>

241
00:18:10,035 --> 00:18:11,696
<i>...and it crushes me.</i>

242
00:18:11,871 --> 00:18:13,304
<i>She could never like me.</i>

243
00:18:13,472 --> 00:18:17,101
<i>Unless l decided to radically change
every detail of my personality...</i>

244
00:18:17,276 --> 00:18:18,971
<i>...l'm going to die a virgin.</i>

245
00:18:31,357 --> 00:18:32,824
-Nick?
-sheeni, nice to see you.

246
00:18:32,992 --> 00:18:35,187
l was going for a walk
and thought l'd drop by.

247
00:18:35,361 --> 00:18:38,558
l remembered that you lived here.
l'm sorry l got upset about Trent.

248
00:18:38,731 --> 00:18:40,926
it was immature.
l'm not normally like that.

249
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:44,160
He sounds like a great guy.
l'd love to hear more of his poetry.

250
00:18:44,336 --> 00:18:46,497
Do you want to go to the beach?
Or get breakfast?

251
00:18:46,672 --> 00:18:48,799
Actually, l'm going on a hike.

252
00:18:48,974 --> 00:18:50,134
l'd ask you to come...

253
00:18:50,309 --> 00:18:53,369
...but you haven't got boots,
provisions, maps or a compass.

254
00:18:53,546 --> 00:18:56,777
l do all my hiking freeform. Like
John Muir, l enter the wilderness...

255
00:18:56,949 --> 00:19:00,350
...with nothing more than my journal
and a child-like sense of wonder.

256
00:19:28,614 --> 00:19:31,549
What the hell is going on?
This is a private journal.

257
00:19:33,719 --> 00:19:35,914
Trent is not an affected twit.

258
00:19:36,088 --> 00:19:38,886
sheeni, how would you like it
if l read your journal?

259
00:19:39,892 --> 00:19:41,484
Go ahead.

260
00:19:50,035 --> 00:19:52,435
it’s written in a shorthand
of my own devising.

261
00:19:52,605 --> 00:19:54,698
A necessity for a girl
with Christian parents.

262
00:19:54,874 --> 00:19:56,307
What does this say?

263
00:19:56,475 --> 00:19:58,238
Wouldn't you like to know?

264
00:19:58,410 --> 00:20:01,573
That last passage would be
of particular interest to you.

265
00:20:01,747 --> 00:20:03,180
l doubt that.

266
00:20:03,349 --> 00:20:07,809
l have very little interest in reading
about Trent's beautiful shoulders.

267
00:20:10,689 --> 00:20:14,352
l haven't made love with Trent,
if that's what you want to know.

268
00:20:15,661 --> 00:20:19,097
l've only made love once
and it was less than erotic.

269
00:20:20,866 --> 00:20:23,426
But l hear it gets better with practice.

270
00:20:26,539 --> 00:20:29,372
You're a virgin. l can tell.

271
00:20:35,548 --> 00:20:37,573
Kiss me, you weenie.

272
00:21:00,506 --> 00:21:02,371
sheeni, l think l love you.

273
00:21:02,541 --> 00:21:03,633
Of course you do.

274
00:21:03,809 --> 00:21:05,777
Well, your hormones certainly do.

275
00:21:08,814 --> 00:21:10,042
sheeni.

276
00:21:10,983 --> 00:21:12,780
Yes, Mother. l'm just here with Nick.

277
00:21:12,952 --> 00:21:15,284
Let's see this young heathen.

278
00:21:15,721 --> 00:21:17,814
Hello, Mrs. Saunders.
it’s nice to meet you.

279
00:21:17,990 --> 00:21:19,753
l doubt that very much.

280
00:21:19,925 --> 00:21:22,359
-See you tomorrow, Nick.
-Okay. Goodbye, sheeni.

281
00:21:22,528 --> 00:21:23,620
Goodbye, Mrs. Saunders.

282
00:21:23,796 --> 00:21:26,959
Look into your soul, young man,
before it's too late.

283
00:21:27,132 --> 00:21:28,656
l will.

284
00:21:32,371 --> 00:21:34,498
<i>Jerry sniffed out a trailer
he wants to buy...</i>

285
00:21:34,673 --> 00:21:36,300
<i>...and insisted we go check it out.</i>

286
00:21:36,475 --> 00:21:40,138
<i>l told sheeni l was going to
write a book about her.</i>

287
00:21:40,312 --> 00:21:42,780
<i>She said it was a terrible idea.</i>

288
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:52,289
Jerry, all the closets
are full of mouse doo dies.

289
00:21:52,458 --> 00:21:54,323
-l might take 950.
-Nine hundred.

290
00:21:54,493 --> 00:21:56,654
-Nine-ten.
-We're in business.

291
00:21:58,130 --> 00:22:00,997
Oh, come here.
Come here, come here.

292
00:22:01,166 --> 00:22:04,192
Hello. Hello.

293
00:22:04,370 --> 00:22:06,565
Nicky, look, isn't he cute?

294
00:22:06,739 --> 00:22:08,673
He's adorable.

295
00:22:09,808 --> 00:22:11,105
How much?

296
00:22:11,510 --> 00:22:12,841
Ten dollars.

297
00:22:21,820 --> 00:22:24,448
All l have is a Subway card
with four stickers.

298
00:22:26,291 --> 00:22:27,349
Sold.

299
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:30,258
Thank you, Nicky.

300
00:22:36,168 --> 00:22:39,365
l think l'm going to name him Albert.

301
00:22:39,538 --> 00:22:42,029
After Albert Camus.

302
00:22:57,956 --> 00:23:01,585
<i>That night was my first indisputable
make-out session with a girl.</i>

303
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:04,251
<i>After grappling in the warm darkness
with sheeni...</i>

304
00:23:04,430 --> 00:23:06,660
<i>...l found this note in my back pocket.</i>

305
00:23:06,832 --> 00:23:09,164
<i>l thought she had been
caressing my ass.</i>

306
00:23:11,737 --> 00:23:12,829
<i>Dear Nick.</i>

307
00:23:13,005 --> 00:23:15,337
<i>Please excuse me
for reading your journal.</i>

308
00:23:15,507 --> 00:23:18,203
<i>l have found that people
who can resist temptation...</i>

309
00:23:18,377 --> 00:23:21,676
<i>...invariably lead
depressingly stunted lives.</i>

310
00:23:21,847 --> 00:23:25,112
<i>Naturally l was charmed
by what you wrote about me.</i>

311
00:23:25,284 --> 00:23:28,720
<i>Your contemplation of suicide
and your invention of Martha...</i>

312
00:23:28,887 --> 00:23:32,789
<i>...cannot help but evoke a strong
emotional response in my breast.</i>

313
00:23:33,392 --> 00:23:34,882
<i>We are both young.</i>

314
00:23:35,060 --> 00:23:38,291
<i>Let's just live
and what happens will happen.</i>

315
00:23:38,464 --> 00:23:41,991
<i>Yours affectionately, sheeni.</i>

316
00:23:51,744 --> 00:23:53,541
l have to leave today.

317
00:23:53,712 --> 00:23:57,978
Jerry threw his back out last night
in bed with my mother...

318
00:23:58,150 --> 00:24:02,246
...so he has to be reunited with
his painkillers back in Oakland.

319
00:24:03,088 --> 00:24:05,113
We're leaving in an hour.

320
00:24:07,226 --> 00:24:09,217
So this will be goodbye.

321
00:24:10,295 --> 00:24:11,762
Goodbye.

322
00:24:11,930 --> 00:24:13,830
You don't have to act so brave,
sheeni.

323
00:24:13,999 --> 00:24:15,967
l wouldn't judge you
if you started to cry.

324
00:24:16,135 --> 00:24:19,002
No, Nicky. it’s Albert.

325
00:24:19,171 --> 00:24:21,162
He snuck out of my room last night.

326
00:24:21,340 --> 00:24:24,673
When l woke up,
he had shredded the family Bible.

327
00:24:24,843 --> 00:24:26,674
My parents took it as a sign of evil.

328
00:24:26,845 --> 00:24:29,939
Now l have to find someone
who will take him.

329
00:24:30,115 --> 00:24:32,379
-Well, l'll take him.
-You will?

330
00:24:32,551 --> 00:24:36,453
l'll have to hide him from my mother
because she can't stand dogs...

331
00:24:36,622 --> 00:24:38,613
...but it's a risk l'm willing to take.

332
00:24:38,791 --> 00:24:40,759
He's our lovechild.

333
00:24:42,127 --> 00:24:44,152
sheeni, l can't stand
the thought of you...

334
00:24:44,329 --> 00:24:47,856
...falling in love with some
egotistical poet while l'm gone.

335
00:24:48,033 --> 00:24:50,661
l've had a great time with you.

336
00:24:50,836 --> 00:24:52,963
it was a really lovely summer fling.

337
00:24:53,939 --> 00:24:57,204
But l can't put my whole life on hold.

338
00:24:58,343 --> 00:24:59,867
You don't even live here.

339
00:25:00,045 --> 00:25:03,173
But we could run away together.
We can escape our families...

340
00:25:03,348 --> 00:25:04,940
...live like outlaws together.

341
00:25:05,117 --> 00:25:08,450
No offense, Nicky,
but it's not exactly in your constitution.

342
00:25:08,620 --> 00:25:12,386
What if my dad could get a job here
in Ukiah and l come live with him?

343
00:25:13,158 --> 00:25:15,683
My mother depends on
the child-support money...

344
00:25:15,861 --> 00:25:17,658
...but maybe l could get kicked out.

345
00:25:17,830 --> 00:25:19,855
That's a lot of what-ifs.

346
00:25:20,032 --> 00:25:23,729
Do you think you could help me find
some job opportunities for my dad?

347
00:25:24,736 --> 00:25:26,226
it’s possible.

348
00:25:26,405 --> 00:25:28,566
We can do this, sheeni.
This can happen.

349
00:25:30,209 --> 00:25:32,871
Well, look at you
taking control of the situation.

350
00:25:33,045 --> 00:25:35,275
l'll do whatever l have to do.

351
00:25:35,681 --> 00:25:40,345
l've never had anything in my life
that l wanted to fight for so much.

352
00:25:40,519 --> 00:25:43,818
Then we'll have to figure out a way
for you to be kicked out.

353
00:25:43,989 --> 00:25:46,355
You have to be bad, Nicky.

354
00:25:46,525 --> 00:25:49,961
Be very, very bad.

355
00:25:50,128 --> 00:25:52,289
<i>l have a tall mountain to climb...</i>

356
00:25:52,464 --> 00:25:54,694
<i>...with many treacherous glaciers
to cross.</i>

357
00:25:54,867 --> 00:26:00,567
<i>But finally l've obtained an entry visa
to the paradise that lays beyond.</i>

358
00:26:00,739 --> 00:26:02,707
l won't let him out of my sight.

359
00:26:29,768 --> 00:26:31,599
Where's the Nova?

360
00:26:31,770 --> 00:26:34,762
See that, babe? They took it back.

361
00:26:34,940 --> 00:26:37,033
Sailors are all talk...

362
00:26:37,209 --> 00:26:39,234
...all the time.

363
00:26:43,282 --> 00:26:44,374
Jerry.

364
00:26:44,549 --> 00:26:46,608
Shit on a goddamn dick.

365
00:26:46,785 --> 00:26:51,688
l have spent the last 1 5 years trying
to get this house to look just perfect.

366
00:26:51,857 --> 00:26:55,987
Oh, God, Nick. Go get a pan quick.
it’s dripping on my new shag.

367
00:26:56,161 --> 00:26:58,061
Yeah, l'll get a pan.

368
00:26:58,230 --> 00:27:01,131
You should have given that man
his money back.

369
00:27:03,502 --> 00:27:06,300
Holy shit. There's still water
in the windshield thing.

370
00:27:07,072 --> 00:27:09,233
But how'd they even get it in here?

371
00:27:09,408 --> 00:27:12,741
Looks like they took it apart
piece by piece and then...

372
00:27:12,911 --> 00:27:15,004
...reassembled it.

373
00:27:15,881 --> 00:27:19,408
But that would take
an army of mechanics to do that.

374
00:27:20,519 --> 00:27:22,009
Or a Navy.

375
00:27:22,187 --> 00:27:24,189
Or a Navy, baby.

376
00:27:36,835 --> 00:27:39,827
l told my parents about my sister
going all the way with Carlo.

377
00:27:40,005 --> 00:27:43,202
Now she's playing that damn
Ashlee Simpson album over and over.

378
00:27:43,375 --> 00:27:46,503
My life is a living hell, Nick.
it is a living hell.

379
00:27:46,678 --> 00:27:49,772
Damn. l think l've got something
to cheer you up, my friend.

380
00:27:50,215 --> 00:27:51,978
His name is Albert.

381
00:27:52,150 --> 00:27:54,584
l don't know why you have a dog.
You hate dogs.

382
00:27:54,753 --> 00:27:57,187
This is more than a dog.

383
00:27:57,356 --> 00:28:00,723
This is my only tangible link
to the love of my life.

384
00:28:00,892 --> 00:28:02,621
You met a girl?

385
00:28:02,794 --> 00:28:04,762
She isn't just a girl, Lefty.

386
00:28:04,930 --> 00:28:06,898
She's a comely angel...

387
00:28:07,065 --> 00:28:09,932
...sent to teach me about
all that is good in the world.

388
00:28:10,102 --> 00:28:12,297
is she prettier than Millie Filbert?

389
00:28:12,738 --> 00:28:14,205
Lefty...

390
00:28:14,373 --> 00:28:16,739
...after seeing sheeni
you would look at Millie...

391
00:28:16,908 --> 00:28:19,775
...and you would see
no more than a slatternly wench...

392
00:28:19,945 --> 00:28:23,813
...trying to muddy your perception
of what a pretty girl should be.

393
00:28:23,982 --> 00:28:26,314
How do l know you're not
making this girl up?

394
00:28:32,958 --> 00:28:35,552
Your life has really changed since
l last saw you, Nick.

395
00:28:36,628 --> 00:28:38,823
How are things going with Millie?

396
00:28:39,931 --> 00:28:43,264
<i>l got this book,
Lovemaking for Advanced Gourmets.</i>

397
00:28:43,435 --> 00:28:46,131
l'm looking up some tips
so l can really blow her mind.

398
00:28:46,304 --> 00:28:48,169
For instance, there's one in here.

399
00:28:48,340 --> 00:28:51,707
You're supposed to stick your pinkie
inside of a girl's bum hole.

400
00:28:51,877 --> 00:28:53,139
-Liar.
-Read it and weep.

401
00:28:53,311 --> 00:28:55,279
l have it marked right there.

402
00:28:58,150 --> 00:29:02,246
l think that sheeni might find this
pinkie technique less than romantic.

403
00:29:02,421 --> 00:29:05,788
Could l borrow this? Might be one
or two things l should know.

404
00:29:05,957 --> 00:29:07,426
Yeah, it's fine.

405
00:29:13,265 --> 00:29:15,290
<i>-Hello?
-Hi, Nicky.</i>

406
00:29:15,467 --> 00:29:18,197
Have you any misdeeds to report?

407
00:29:18,370 --> 00:29:20,099
<i>l'm working on it.</i>

408
00:29:20,272 --> 00:29:21,796
<i>Nicky.</i>

409
00:29:21,973 --> 00:29:24,703
<i>-You sound concerned.
-lf you don't take the initiative...</i>

410
00:29:24,876 --> 00:29:27,401
...how do you think you'll feel
when l marry Francois?

411
00:29:27,579 --> 00:29:28,773
Who's Francois?

412
00:29:28,947 --> 00:29:30,915
My future French husband.

413
00:29:32,717 --> 00:29:35,880
<i>Well, l mean,
l can't wait for you forever.</i>

414
00:29:37,789 --> 00:29:40,417
Nick, how is my darling Albert?

415
00:29:40,592 --> 00:29:41,820
<i>Albert is great.</i>

416
00:29:41,993 --> 00:29:44,587
We've been going on
these bonding jogs twice daily...

417
00:29:44,763 --> 00:29:46,924
...which he loves.
l've been enjoying them too.

418
00:29:47,099 --> 00:29:49,192
They've been getting me
into great shape.

419
00:29:49,367 --> 00:29:51,198
<i>That's wonderful, darling.</i>

420
00:29:52,571 --> 00:29:54,562
<i>My one and only love
needs me to be bad...</i>

421
00:29:55,807 --> 00:29:59,106
<i>...to overcome the inhibitions
that compel me to be law-abiding...</i>

422
00:29:59,277 --> 00:30:02,178
<i>...polite to my elders
and excessively nice.</i>

423
00:30:02,347 --> 00:30:04,815
<i>l have decided to create
a supplementary persona...</i>

424
00:30:04,983 --> 00:30:07,042
<i>...named Francois Dillinger.</i>

425
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:09,948
<i>Bold...</i>

426
00:30:10,122 --> 00:30:11,749
<i>...contemptuous of authority...</i>

427
00:30:11,923 --> 00:30:14,255
<i>...and irresistible to women.</i>

428
00:30:14,826 --> 00:30:17,556
<i>Francois is just the type
of aggressive sociopath...</i>

429
00:30:17,729 --> 00:30:20,493
<i>...who can wage, and win,
a war of nerves.</i>

430
00:30:30,709 --> 00:30:33,269
Better give your mother a hug, son.

431
00:30:34,045 --> 00:30:35,239
Oh, no.

432
00:30:35,413 --> 00:30:39,179
<i>it turns out Jerry had a heart attack
in a Dallas bar and took it badly.</i>

433
00:30:39,351 --> 00:30:40,443
<i>He died.</i>

434
00:30:40,619 --> 00:30:43,520
When will the body arrive?

435
00:30:44,589 --> 00:30:46,784
l'm afraid it's already been
shipped, ma'am...

436
00:30:46,958 --> 00:30:48,152
...to his wife.

437
00:30:48,326 --> 00:30:50,419
His wife?

438
00:30:51,363 --> 00:30:53,456
Yes, ma'am, his wife.

439
00:30:55,133 --> 00:30:58,728
it’s also my duty to inform you
she wishes to claim the Lincoln...

440
00:30:58,904 --> 00:31:01,930
...which he registered
to this address.

441
00:31:08,346 --> 00:31:09,677
it’s okay.

442
00:31:09,848 --> 00:31:12,112
There, there. it’s going to be okay.

443
00:31:12,284 --> 00:31:15,048
There, there.
Everything will be okay.

444
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:30,493
Those are my records.
What are you doing?

445
00:31:30,669 --> 00:31:34,469
You're not going to get this girl by
listening to records and jerking off.

446
00:31:34,639 --> 00:31:37,130
Well, that wasn't my entire plan.

447
00:31:37,309 --> 00:31:38,674
What is your plan, shithead?

448
00:31:38,843 --> 00:31:41,937
Slouching your shoulders
while Trent boy has her on his lap?

449
00:31:42,113 --> 00:31:44,673
l don't need you here right now.
l just need to think.

450
00:31:44,849 --> 00:31:46,339
Well, l'm not going anywhere.

451
00:31:46,518 --> 00:31:49,078
Not until you sink your filthy dick
in this tomato.

452
00:31:49,688 --> 00:31:51,952
Not until you get what you want.

453
00:31:53,024 --> 00:31:55,618
Now it's time to rebel, Nick.

454
00:31:55,794 --> 00:31:57,659
it’s time to be bad.

455
00:31:57,829 --> 00:32:01,458
it’s not a good day for that.
My mom got some devastating news.

456
00:32:02,300 --> 00:32:03,995
That's perfect.

457
00:32:04,169 --> 00:32:05,932
She's vulnerable.

458
00:32:06,104 --> 00:32:08,038
She's fragile.

459
00:32:08,506 --> 00:32:11,498
Now, what does she value
more than anything?

460
00:32:12,811 --> 00:32:15,109
She values her things.

461
00:32:22,220 --> 00:32:23,744
<i>With the guidance of Francois...</i>

462
00:32:23,922 --> 00:32:27,119
<i>...l quickly transformed myself
into a textbook juvenile delinquent.</i>

463
00:32:29,628 --> 00:32:31,823
<i>sheeni has held up
her end of the bargain...</i>

464
00:32:31,997 --> 00:32:35,296
<i>...by finding Dad work at a magazine
called Progressive Plywood.</i>

465
00:32:35,467 --> 00:32:38,061
<i>She called him
pretending to be a head hunter.</i>

466
00:32:38,236 --> 00:32:40,397
<i>-Really?
-it took some convincing on her part.</i>

467
00:32:40,572 --> 00:32:43,166
Sounds cool,
but l don't know much about wood.

468
00:32:43,341 --> 00:32:44,933
That's not what l've heard.

469
00:32:45,110 --> 00:32:48,443
<i>To my chagrin, the magazine is
owned by the father of Trent Preston.</i>

470
00:32:48,613 --> 00:32:51,514
<i>-Let me go first, this is heavy.
-There were no other options.</i>

471
00:32:51,683 --> 00:32:53,048
Nice house, right?

472
00:33:01,793 --> 00:33:04,159
Oh, thank you.

473
00:33:06,231 --> 00:33:08,062
Oh, thanks. Ex-squeeze me.

474
00:33:08,233 --> 00:33:09,291
Sit over there.

475
00:33:10,468 --> 00:33:13,335
-Oh, Nicky.
-Morning, everyone.

476
00:33:13,938 --> 00:33:16,805
isn’t it nice of Officer Westcott
to drop by so early...

477
00:33:16,975 --> 00:33:19,535
...and have breakfast with us?

478
00:33:19,711 --> 00:33:22,509
Oh, it sure was. Yeah, that's nice.

479
00:33:22,681 --> 00:33:25,650
Oh, your father called.
He got a job in Ukiah.

480
00:33:25,817 --> 00:33:27,717
That's good for him.

481
00:33:27,886 --> 00:33:29,353
Good.

482
00:33:31,289 --> 00:33:34,986
Do you think it might be a good idea
if l moved in with him for a little bit?

483
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:37,424
You know as well as l do
that's not going to work.

484
00:33:37,595 --> 00:33:39,825
l depend on that
child-support money to eat.

485
00:33:41,433 --> 00:33:44,596
Shouldn't you depend on child-support
money to support your child?

486
00:33:44,769 --> 00:33:48,330
Hey, be nice to your mom, kid.
She's grieving.

487
00:33:53,778 --> 00:33:56,542
When do l take this off?
How long do you leave it on for?

488
00:33:56,715 --> 00:33:59,309
Just leave it on for three minutes.

489
00:34:04,756 --> 00:34:06,280
Shit.

490
00:34:06,624 --> 00:34:09,388
Those fuckers
are taking a shower together.

491
00:34:09,661 --> 00:34:11,424
How repulsive.

492
00:34:18,670 --> 00:34:20,900
-Shit! Shit! Turn it off!
-Fuck!

493
00:34:32,951 --> 00:34:35,613
What was all that racket last night?

494
00:34:40,225 --> 00:34:42,853
Nicky, l'm sorry if we disturbed you.

495
00:34:43,027 --> 00:34:45,518
You know, this is my home too.

496
00:34:46,030 --> 00:34:49,761
All of a sudden some stranger starts
staying over, l'm not even consulted.

497
00:34:51,636 --> 00:34:54,332
What's with you, kid?
Just mind your own damn business.

498
00:34:54,506 --> 00:34:55,939
No, you mind your business.

499
00:34:56,107 --> 00:34:58,132
He's my son.

500
00:34:59,344 --> 00:35:03,280
Nicky, you're right. l should have
informed you that Officer Westcott...

501
00:35:03,448 --> 00:35:06,315
...was going to be spending the evening.
l'm sorry.

502
00:35:06,484 --> 00:35:09,817
l thought there were laws in the city
against illicit cohabitation.

503
00:35:11,222 --> 00:35:13,656
Or are they just another
big policeman's joke?

504
00:35:13,825 --> 00:35:16,885
Kid, you're asking for trouble.
Just don't.

505
00:35:17,061 --> 00:35:18,392
Just don't.

506
00:35:18,830 --> 00:35:21,060
Or what are you going to do?

507
00:35:21,232 --> 00:35:22,324
Shoot me with your gun?

508
00:35:22,767 --> 00:35:25,395
All right, all right. Lance.
Okay, okay, okay.

509
00:35:25,570 --> 00:35:28,698
You just shut your mouth right now.
Right now.

510
00:35:29,607 --> 00:35:31,404
Thanks for breakfast.

511
00:35:31,576 --> 00:35:33,737
Where are you going?

512
00:35:46,257 --> 00:35:47,918
What are those for?

513
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:52,521
You and l are going to find a nice quiet
parking lot and set this baby on fire.

514
00:35:52,697 --> 00:35:55,495
-l thought we were going to wreck it.
-Use your head.

515
00:35:55,667 --> 00:35:58,033
No sense getting killed for a girl.

516
00:36:07,145 --> 00:36:10,205
-Sure you know what you're doing?
-Relax, kid. l read the book.

517
00:36:10,381 --> 00:36:12,349
Okay, pull over. Pull over.

518
00:36:13,218 --> 00:36:14,515
We have to pull over.

519
00:36:14,686 --> 00:36:16,620
Pull over now.

520
00:36:17,755 --> 00:36:19,052
Okay.

521
00:36:19,224 --> 00:36:22,955
We need to consider our actions
and what the consequences will be.

522
00:36:23,127 --> 00:36:24,685
Listen, asshole.

523
00:36:24,863 --> 00:36:28,822
You've been making all the decisions
for 1 6 years. Look at where you are.

524
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,831
l'm here to rescue you from yourself.

525
00:36:31,002 --> 00:36:33,334
Just be quiet
and let me blow some shit up.

526
00:36:33,505 --> 00:36:36,668
Can l make one request since
it's my life that we're talking about?

527
00:36:36,841 --> 00:36:39,935
Can we keep it to the absolute
minimum amount of destruction?

528
00:36:40,111 --> 00:36:42,011
Yeah, perfect. Okay.

529
00:36:42,180 --> 00:36:44,705
Absolute minimum. That's good.

530
00:36:44,883 --> 00:36:46,475
l like that.

531
00:37:25,857 --> 00:37:27,119
Let's get out of here!

532
00:38:52,210 --> 00:38:54,371
<i>Luckily no major injuries
were reported...</i>

533
00:38:54,545 --> 00:38:57,480
<i>...though several fire fighters
were hospitalized due to....</i>

534
00:38:59,150 --> 00:39:00,742
Hi, guys. How was dinner?

535
00:39:00,918 --> 00:39:02,681
Keep your lips sewn, fucker.

536
00:39:02,854 --> 00:39:06,153
You stole your mother's car and trailer
and you set a $5 million fire?

537
00:39:06,324 --> 00:39:08,485
l refuse to stand for
such allegations.

538
00:39:08,660 --> 00:39:10,890
Nicky, they have a description
of the arsonist.

539
00:39:11,062 --> 00:39:14,054
Right here. ''White teenage male,
approximately 5'9''.

540
00:39:14,232 --> 00:39:16,894
1 35 pounds, dirty blond hair.

541
00:39:17,068 --> 00:39:23,632
Last seen pulling a trailer with 'God's
Perfect Asshole' painted on the side.''

542
00:39:23,808 --> 00:39:25,036
That could be anyone.

543
00:39:25,209 --> 00:39:28,576
God, my only son is going to prison.
What am l going to do?

544
00:39:28,746 --> 00:39:31,806
No, no, no.

545
00:39:31,983 --> 00:39:34,144
it’s going to be okay.

546
00:39:34,318 --> 00:39:36,479
You know what? l'll tell you what.

547
00:39:36,654 --> 00:39:41,023
l'll just say that Nick reported the car
stolen before the fire.

548
00:39:41,192 --> 00:39:44,161
This way it'll get him off the hook.
Okay?

549
00:39:45,496 --> 00:39:48,693
But l could take
some serious, serious heat for this.

550
00:39:48,866 --> 00:39:50,959
Oh, Lance, you are so wonderful.

551
00:39:51,135 --> 00:39:53,399
What can l ever do to repay you?

552
00:39:54,038 --> 00:39:55,528
l'll think of something.

553
00:39:55,707 --> 00:39:58,039
Oh, but you know what?
You know what, baby?

554
00:39:58,543 --> 00:40:03,071
l don't think he should be here
when the detectives come around.

555
00:40:03,247 --> 00:40:04,771
Right?

556
00:40:04,949 --> 00:40:09,443
So the best thing to do
is to send him away for a while.

557
00:40:12,690 --> 00:40:15,591
Let him go make his father's life
miserable for a change.

558
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:18,228
-But l like it here.
-You're gone, buster.

559
00:40:20,398 --> 00:40:21,422
<i>Hello?</i>

560
00:40:21,599 --> 00:40:24,625
Your son just burned down Berkeley.
Come and get the brat.

561
00:40:24,802 --> 00:40:26,736
<i>-Estelle?
-Start packing your bags.</i>

562
00:40:26,904 --> 00:40:29,304
Oh, no, no.

563
00:40:29,474 --> 00:40:31,305
Aren't you going to punish him?

564
00:40:31,476 --> 00:40:33,910
l'd say he deserves a good hiding.

565
00:40:34,078 --> 00:40:37,741
He's just too much for me anymore.
Can you do it, hon.?

566
00:40:37,915 --> 00:40:40,110
Yeah, l could help you out.

567
00:40:46,824 --> 00:40:48,655
<i>l stepped away for a few minutes.</i>

568
00:40:48,826 --> 00:40:51,795
<i>Francois volunteered
to take the thrashing.</i>

569
00:40:51,963 --> 00:40:54,989
<i>A painful sacrifice
for the woman l love.</i>

570
00:40:55,967 --> 00:40:57,867
You through, big man?

571
00:41:02,340 --> 00:41:04,638
<i>So off we go to beautiful Ukiah...</i>

572
00:41:04,809 --> 00:41:06,800
<i>...where soon l'll be
in the warm embrace...</i>

573
00:41:06,978 --> 00:41:09,538
<i>...of the mother
of my future gifted children.</i>

574
00:41:19,357 --> 00:41:21,018
<i>-Hello?
-sheeni, it's Nick.</i>

575
00:41:22,293 --> 00:41:24,124
<i>Hi, darling. Where are you?</i>

576
00:41:24,295 --> 00:41:26,422
<i>l'm here. l'm in Ukiah.</i>

577
00:41:26,597 --> 00:41:28,827
<i>l'm living with my dad.
My mother kicked me out.</i>

578
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,194
How did you do it?

579
00:41:30,368 --> 00:41:33,166
l stole my mother's car
and burned down half of Berkeley.

580
00:41:33,337 --> 00:41:35,635
<i>She had no choice
but to send me away.</i>

581
00:41:35,807 --> 00:41:38,776
<i>-Nicky, that's incredible.
-Well, l did it for you, sheeni.</i>

582
00:41:38,943 --> 00:41:41,070
l did it so that we could be together.

583
00:41:41,245 --> 00:41:43,679
l bet you didn't think l had it in me,
did you?

584
00:41:43,848 --> 00:41:46,373
That is so romantic, Nicky.
l don't know what to say.

585
00:41:46,551 --> 00:41:47,950
<i>it’ll be just like we planned.</i>

586
00:41:48,119 --> 00:41:50,383
it’ll be you and me and Albert,
all together.

587
00:41:51,689 --> 00:41:53,623
Hello, Mr. Saunders.
is sheeni available?

588
00:41:53,791 --> 00:41:55,383
She most certainly is not.

589
00:41:55,560 --> 00:41:58,222
We know all about what you did
in Berkeley, young man.

590
00:41:58,396 --> 00:42:02,628
You are lucky l don't strangle you
right here in Christ's eyes.

591
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:05,291
You're the devil
and that dog is a hell beast.

592
00:42:05,469 --> 00:42:09,200
You're lucky we don't call the police
and have you arrested right now.

593
00:42:09,373 --> 00:42:11,034
You're not going to let me
see sheeni?

594
00:42:11,209 --> 00:42:12,233
sheeni’s leaving.

595
00:42:12,410 --> 00:42:14,037
-We're sending her away.
-What?

596
00:42:14,212 --> 00:42:16,510
To boarding school,
where she'll be safe.

597
00:42:16,681 --> 00:42:21,141
She's had a lot of bad influences
here in Ukiah, you being the worst.

598
00:42:21,319 --> 00:42:23,719
l'm in love with sheeni.
l can't live without her.

599
00:42:23,888 --> 00:42:26,186
Live without her or die,
we have no preference.

600
00:42:26,357 --> 00:42:28,621
Stay out of our family's life.

601
00:42:32,463 --> 00:42:34,055
<i>Later sheeni called and told me...</i>

602
00:42:34,232 --> 00:42:37,167
<i>...she managed to turn disaster
into an opportunity for herself.</i>

603
00:42:37,335 --> 00:42:38,632
<i>She convinced her parents...</i>

604
00:42:38,803 --> 00:42:42,000
<i>...to send her to a French prep school
200 miles away in Santa Cruz.</i>

605
00:42:42,173 --> 00:42:45,870
<i>She says she's been wanting to go to
this school since she was a little girl...</i>

606
00:42:46,043 --> 00:42:47,271
<i>...and that going there...</i>

607
00:42:47,445 --> 00:42:50,346
<i>...will improve her chances
for going to school in Paris.</i>

608
00:42:50,514 --> 00:42:51,674
<i>Things are bad.</i>

609
00:42:51,849 --> 00:42:54,374
How am l supposed to eat
with this hideous dog staring?

610
00:42:54,552 --> 00:42:56,247
He likes you, George.

611
00:42:56,420 --> 00:42:58,217
Well, the feeling's not mutual.

612
00:42:59,724 --> 00:43:00,884
Nick?

613
00:43:01,058 --> 00:43:04,653
You won't be getting an allowance.
Might want to think about getting a job.

614
00:43:04,829 --> 00:43:06,990
-Okay.
-There's an opening at my office.

615
00:43:07,164 --> 00:43:08,722
Typing and filing after school.

616
00:43:08,900 --> 00:43:10,891
isn’t that what that boy Trent does?

617
00:43:11,068 --> 00:43:14,504
Trent went away to some
French-speaking prep school...

618
00:43:14,672 --> 00:43:17,197
...down south. Santa Cruz, l think.

619
00:43:28,552 --> 00:43:29,678
Hello.

620
00:43:29,854 --> 00:43:32,379
-You're new here, right?
-Yeah.

621
00:43:32,556 --> 00:43:34,888
l'm Vijay Joshi. it’s nice to meet you.

622
00:43:35,059 --> 00:43:36,754
Nick Twisp. Pleasure to meet you.

623
00:43:42,533 --> 00:43:45,297
So have you made many friends
in Ukiah yet, Nick?

624
00:43:45,469 --> 00:43:47,562
Not really.
l moved here for my girlfriend...

625
00:43:47,738 --> 00:43:50,400
...and she just went to some
French school in Santa Cruz.

626
00:43:50,574 --> 00:43:53,975
-sheeni Saunders?
-Yeah. Did you know her?

627
00:43:54,145 --> 00:43:55,476
We were locker neighbours.

628
00:43:55,646 --> 00:43:58,672
So you are her new fellow?

629
00:43:59,583 --> 00:44:01,175
l'm surprised.

630
00:44:01,352 --> 00:44:02,944
Why's that?

631
00:44:03,120 --> 00:44:05,953
it’s just that to replace
the magnificent Trent Preston...

632
00:44:06,123 --> 00:44:08,683
...one expects at least a minor deity.

633
00:44:09,660 --> 00:44:12,959
it’s good to know us short fellows
have appeal with the ladies.

634
00:44:13,130 --> 00:44:17,089
Right. l believe l'm of average height
for my age, Vijay.

635
00:44:17,268 --> 00:44:18,963
Do tell sheeni l say hello.

636
00:44:19,136 --> 00:44:21,730
How fortunate
to attend L'Ecole des Arts.

637
00:44:21,906 --> 00:44:23,464
l've always wanted to go.

638
00:44:23,641 --> 00:44:25,973
-Do you speak French?
-Yes, fluently.

639
00:44:26,143 --> 00:44:28,543
She says English is forbidden
on campus.

640
00:44:28,713 --> 00:44:33,241
''Even if you are haemorrhaging
from an accidental limb amputation.''

641
00:44:33,851 --> 00:44:35,978
She has a roommate from New York,
Taggard...

642
00:44:36,153 --> 00:44:38,087
...who has already slept with
1 7 guys...

643
00:44:38,255 --> 00:44:40,621
...and hopes to rack up 50
before college.

644
00:44:41,292 --> 00:44:43,089
l really must meet this girl.

645
00:44:43,861 --> 00:44:44,885
Keep going.

646
00:44:45,062 --> 00:44:46,996
She says Trent has taken up
windsurfing...

647
00:44:47,164 --> 00:44:50,258
...and become target number one
among all the girls in her class.

648
00:44:50,434 --> 00:44:51,992
She's trying not to be jealous...

649
00:44:52,169 --> 00:44:54,501
...but sometimes experiences
twinges of distress.

650
00:44:54,672 --> 00:44:58,369
She also says that Trent's presence
on campus came as a shock to her...

651
00:44:58,542 --> 00:45:02,911
...and that it is merely a coincidence
they transferred to the same school.

652
00:45:03,080 --> 00:45:05,173
Yeah. Somehow l can't feature that.

653
00:45:05,349 --> 00:45:08,079
Trent has expressed interest in
mending the relationship...

654
00:45:08,252 --> 00:45:10,812
...and getting on like adults.
l think she's happy...

655
00:45:10,988 --> 00:45:14,424
...and looks forward to growth
in this rich intellectual environment.

656
00:45:14,592 --> 00:45:16,287
-l don't like the sound of this.
-No.

657
00:45:16,460 --> 00:45:18,690
And that roommate sounds like
a bad influence.

658
00:45:18,863 --> 00:45:21,161
She certainly sounds uninhibited.

659
00:45:21,332 --> 00:45:23,232
l wonder if she likes intelligent boys.

660
00:45:23,401 --> 00:45:27,167
Trent Preston is going to mindfuck her
into thinking she's too good for me.

661
00:45:27,338 --> 00:45:31,468
Then he's probably going to fuck her
in more literal ways.

662
00:45:32,877 --> 00:45:34,435
l've got to get down there.

663
00:45:34,612 --> 00:45:36,739
l could accompany you
and meet this Taggard.

664
00:45:36,914 --> 00:45:39,508
Okay.
How are we going to get down there?

665
00:45:39,683 --> 00:45:42,846
-We could use my grandmother's car.
-Will she let us have it?

666
00:45:43,020 --> 00:45:45,011
She's hooked up to
life-support equipment.

667
00:45:45,189 --> 00:45:46,850
Permission is not a salient issue.

668
00:45:47,024 --> 00:45:48,389
Vijay, that's great.

669
00:46:30,901 --> 00:46:34,234
Excuse me. Do you guys know
sheeni Saunders?

670
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:37,969
Very helpful.

671
00:46:41,345 --> 00:46:44,075
Excuse me.
Do you guys know sheeni Saunders?

672
00:46:44,448 --> 00:46:46,211
Are you fucking kidding me?

673
00:46:47,651 --> 00:46:49,278
-Do you see her?
-l'm afraid not.

674
00:46:50,121 --> 00:46:51,782
Do you guys know sheeni Saunders?

675
00:46:51,956 --> 00:46:54,322
sheeni Saunders.
Do you speak English?

676
00:46:54,492 --> 00:46:56,050
Do you speak English?

677
00:46:56,227 --> 00:46:58,457
You don't speak English? Liar.

678
00:46:58,629 --> 00:47:00,096
Bullshit.

679
00:47:00,297 --> 00:47:01,321
Speak English to me.

680
00:47:01,765 --> 00:47:03,926
Nobody speaks English?
This is America.

681
00:47:04,101 --> 00:47:06,296
-You fucking kidding me?
-Nick?

682
00:47:07,271 --> 00:47:08,602
sheeni.

683
00:47:08,772 --> 00:47:11,104
Albert.

684
00:47:11,408 --> 00:47:13,342
-Hello.
-Hi.

685
00:47:19,783 --> 00:47:23,378
l can't believe you came all this way.
And with Albert.

686
00:47:23,554 --> 00:47:25,852
l had to see you, sheeni.

687
00:47:26,023 --> 00:47:27,615
l can't stop thinking about you.

688
00:47:27,791 --> 00:47:29,452
That's sweet.

689
00:47:30,461 --> 00:47:33,225
And Albert won't stop
talking about you.

690
00:47:33,964 --> 00:47:36,797
Do you find your classes
stimulating?

691
00:47:37,468 --> 00:47:39,402
A few of them are all right.

692
00:47:39,603 --> 00:47:42,572
At the moment l'm doing a historical
analysis on the Ramayana.

693
00:47:43,307 --> 00:47:45,070
Ah, yes.

694
00:47:47,311 --> 00:47:50,769
<i>Blow, oh wind
To where my loved one is</i>

695
00:47:51,982 --> 00:47:53,711
<i>Touch him</i>

696
00:47:54,018 --> 00:47:57,613
<i>And come touch me soon</i>

697
00:48:01,492 --> 00:48:05,053
You two boys shouldn't sleep in
your car tonight. it might not be safe.

698
00:48:05,229 --> 00:48:07,322
We could sneak you in
after lights out.

699
00:48:07,498 --> 00:48:09,693
-Sounds great.
-l'm in.

700
00:48:10,267 --> 00:48:15,432
Madame, l am suffering from
agonizing female troubles.

701
00:48:20,377 --> 00:48:21,844
There's your competition.

702
00:49:41,692 --> 00:49:44,855
You think that Trent fellow
would sleep on the floor?

703
00:49:56,507 --> 00:49:58,941
-Hey.
-Hey.

704
00:50:04,281 --> 00:50:06,010
l'm sorry, sweetie...

705
00:50:06,183 --> 00:50:08,583
...but not with other people
in the room.

706
00:50:14,591 --> 00:50:15,922
Okay.

707
00:50:21,699 --> 00:50:24,065
-Good night.
-Night.

708
00:50:55,165 --> 00:50:56,655
Who are you?

709
00:50:56,834 --> 00:50:59,860
l'm sheeni’s friend Nick.
l'm sorry to have disturbed you.

710
00:51:00,037 --> 00:51:02,562
it’s okay. You don't have to go.

711
00:51:04,308 --> 00:51:07,937
So are you sheeni’s boyfriend
or something?

712
00:51:08,112 --> 00:51:09,773
Yeah.

713
00:51:10,381 --> 00:51:12,542
And you're spending the night?

714
00:51:12,716 --> 00:51:13,978
Where's Taggard?

715
00:51:14,151 --> 00:51:17,086
Sleeping. A friend and l
are just camping out on the floor.

716
00:51:17,688 --> 00:51:20,384
l get it. A slumber party.

717
00:51:22,459 --> 00:51:24,256
l'm Bernice.

718
00:51:24,561 --> 00:51:27,029
Bernice Lynch. Not that you asked.

719
00:51:27,197 --> 00:51:30,098
Bernice Lynch,
that's a very pretty name.

720
00:51:30,834 --> 00:51:34,429
l think that my friend Trent Preston
might have mentioned you.

721
00:51:34,605 --> 00:51:39,065
Yeah, Bernice Lynch. But he said that
you were frumpy and unpreventable.

722
00:51:39,243 --> 00:51:42,269
Now that l've met you,
l can see that Trent is a lying bastard.

723
00:51:42,446 --> 00:51:46,075
l shouldn't be his friend if he goes
around calling you trashy-looking.

724
00:51:46,250 --> 00:51:47,740
What kind of person does that?

725
00:51:47,918 --> 00:51:50,386
But, you know,
he's been very sensitive and touchy...

726
00:51:50,554 --> 00:51:52,579
...ever since he started doing steroids.

727
00:51:52,756 --> 00:51:55,452
-Trent does steroids?
-He does a lot of steroids.

728
00:51:55,626 --> 00:51:58,390
He says it's to ensure that
he becomes the best windsurfer.

729
00:51:58,562 --> 00:52:01,554
He figures since he can't write poetry,
he has to plagiarize....

730
00:52:01,732 --> 00:52:04,667
You mean all of his poetry is stolen?

731
00:52:05,102 --> 00:52:08,902
Of course. it’s all classic Bobby Frost.
Every word.

732
00:52:09,072 --> 00:52:11,973
Trent and sheeni can go to hell.

733
00:52:38,335 --> 00:52:40,963
-Hey.
-Hi.

734
00:52:43,373 --> 00:52:46,069
Hey, it's a bit cold on the floor.

735
00:52:46,243 --> 00:52:47,733
is it?

736
00:52:48,378 --> 00:52:51,939
Yeah. Do you think maybe l could
cuddle next to you?

737
00:52:54,985 --> 00:52:56,816
The whole night?

738
00:52:57,721 --> 00:52:59,188
Yeah.

739
00:53:01,492 --> 00:53:03,790
Yeah, l guess that would be okay.

740
00:53:04,661 --> 00:53:07,095
Or we could do more than just cuddle.

741
00:53:08,899 --> 00:53:09,991
Nick.

742
00:53:10,167 --> 00:53:12,795
l love it when you say my name.

743
00:53:12,970 --> 00:53:14,870
Why don't you pull down
these blankets...

744
00:53:15,038 --> 00:53:17,131
...and show me
what you're hiding under there?

745
00:53:17,307 --> 00:53:19,468
is that what you want me to do?

746
00:53:20,377 --> 00:53:24,177
-Say yes.
-That is exactly what l want you to do.

747
00:53:24,348 --> 00:53:27,283
And then l want to
tickle your belly button...

748
00:53:27,451 --> 00:53:29,442
...from the inside.

749
00:53:30,654 --> 00:53:32,781
Nick, you're being so bad.

750
00:53:32,956 --> 00:53:36,824
Not half as bad as the nasty things
l want to do right now with my tongue.

751
00:53:38,762 --> 00:53:40,662
l'm going to wrap your legs
around my head...

752
00:53:40,898 --> 00:53:43,230
...and where you like the crown
that you are.

753
00:53:44,368 --> 00:53:46,359
lf that's okay with you.

754
00:53:53,577 --> 00:53:55,408
My God,
what's gotten into you tonight?

755
00:53:55,579 --> 00:53:57,877
l don't know, but let's go with it.

756
00:54:23,707 --> 00:54:25,231
Nick!

757
00:54:26,109 --> 00:54:27,599
Nick. You have to take Albert.

758
00:54:54,304 --> 00:54:57,671
God, we were so close. Fuck.

759
00:54:57,841 --> 00:54:59,832
How was it, Vijay?

760
00:55:00,010 --> 00:55:01,272
it was magnificent.

761
00:55:01,445 --> 00:55:03,242
l fear it could be terribly addicting.

762
00:55:03,413 --> 00:55:06,849
This night has ignited in me
a lust of disturbing insatiability.

763
00:55:07,017 --> 00:55:08,314
Yeah, well, congratulations.

764
00:55:08,485 --> 00:55:10,919
Fuck. Fuck. Fuck.

765
00:55:11,088 --> 00:55:12,680
Fuck. Fuck.

766
00:55:14,191 --> 00:55:16,022
Fuck.

767
00:55:16,193 --> 00:55:18,491
Fuck. Fuck.

768
00:55:21,932 --> 00:55:23,490
Fuck.

769
00:55:27,638 --> 00:55:28,764
<i>Hello?</i>

770
00:55:28,939 --> 00:55:30,600
Mr. Ferguson, it's Nick.

771
00:55:30,774 --> 00:55:32,833
<i>Oh, Nick boy. How are you, son?</i>

772
00:55:33,010 --> 00:55:34,272
Not so good, Mr. Ferguson.

773
00:55:34,444 --> 00:55:36,935
l'm attempting to smuggle
a young illegal immigrant...

774
00:55:37,114 --> 00:55:40,083
...who's fleeing political oppression
on the subcontinent...

775
00:55:40,250 --> 00:55:42,411
...but we've become stranded
in our attempts...

776
00:55:42,586 --> 00:55:45,749
...and now we face not being able
to get to the sanctuary at all.

777
00:55:45,922 --> 00:55:47,719
<i>Oh, dear, the poor lad.</i>

778
00:55:47,891 --> 00:55:51,327
Yeah, it's breaking my heart.
He's got the saddest look on his face.

779
00:55:54,231 --> 00:55:55,721
Those poor girls.

780
00:55:55,899 --> 00:55:59,266
They'll likely notify their parents,
perhaps even expel them.

781
00:56:00,804 --> 00:56:02,499
Expel them?

782
00:56:03,073 --> 00:56:04,700
Oh, my God, you're right.

783
00:56:04,875 --> 00:56:06,672
They'll be expelled.

784
00:56:07,511 --> 00:56:10,241
sheeni will have to
come back to Ukiah.

785
00:56:10,714 --> 00:56:14,115
Bernice, you sweet angel
of the lavatory.

786
00:56:14,751 --> 00:56:16,480
Come on.

787
00:56:19,923 --> 00:56:21,254
Mr. Ferguson.

788
00:56:23,393 --> 00:56:24,883
Good heavens.

789
00:56:25,062 --> 00:56:27,895
You boys must be freezing.

790
00:56:28,732 --> 00:56:31,462
And this must be the little soldier.

791
00:56:35,639 --> 00:56:37,038
Welcome.

792
00:56:38,475 --> 00:56:40,238
What's happened to your clothes,
son?

793
00:56:44,114 --> 00:56:46,241
took them.

794
00:56:46,416 --> 00:56:47,781
Damn them.

795
00:56:47,951 --> 00:56:51,978
When l was arriving by the customs,
sir. it was so terrible.

796
00:56:52,155 --> 00:56:55,181
They told me l was even lucky
to keep my knickers.

797
00:56:56,793 --> 00:56:58,693
Well, that nightmare is over.

798
00:57:00,263 --> 00:57:03,391
And why don't you have
any clothes on, Nick?

799
00:57:05,435 --> 00:57:07,403
Solidarity.

800
00:57:11,141 --> 00:57:13,609
Thanks for getting us, Mr. Ferguson.

801
00:57:14,878 --> 00:57:16,869
So this safe house is in Ukiah?

802
00:57:17,047 --> 00:57:18,275
That's right.

803
00:57:18,448 --> 00:57:20,313
You're certain
they'll take care of him?

804
00:57:20,484 --> 00:57:23,510
Oh, yeah. They'll treat him
as if he were their own.

805
00:57:28,525 --> 00:57:32,359
<i>After we dropped Vijay off, l asked
Mr. Ferguson to spend the night.</i>

806
00:57:32,529 --> 00:57:34,622
<i>it would give Dad
a chance to reciprocate...</i>

807
00:57:34,798 --> 00:57:37,494
<i>...for all the nights he spent on
Mr. Ferguson's couch...</i>

808
00:57:37,667 --> 00:57:40,693
<i>...before he and Mom
finally tossed in the towel.</i>

809
00:57:40,871 --> 00:57:44,307
<i>Mr. Ferguson agreed not to tell Dad
about the refugee.</i>

810
00:57:44,474 --> 00:57:47,602
<i>He understands that sometimes
you have to lie for a greater cause.</i>

811
00:57:47,778 --> 00:57:50,747
You know what, you are a tight-assed,
critical, sexist drunk.

812
00:57:50,914 --> 00:57:53,815
Hey, honey, it doesn't bother me
if you want to sleep alone.

813
00:57:53,984 --> 00:57:57,078
Well, does it bother you
that you're a boring selfish lover?

814
00:57:59,856 --> 00:58:03,087
l ran into Mr. Ferguson downtown.
is it okay if he spends the night?

815
00:58:03,260 --> 00:58:05,524
What the hell are you doing
in your underwear?

816
00:58:10,967 --> 00:58:12,594
Hi, Nick.

817
00:58:17,307 --> 00:58:18,740
Want a hit?

818
00:58:19,242 --> 00:58:21,142
Sorry, do l know you?

819
00:58:22,179 --> 00:58:25,444
l'm Paul. sheeni’s older brother.

820
00:58:26,883 --> 00:58:28,578
Come on in.

821
00:58:47,637 --> 00:58:50,834
-How'd you know it was me, Paul?
-We've met.

822
00:58:51,575 --> 00:58:53,133
No we haven't.

823
00:58:53,910 --> 00:58:55,241
in a previous life.

824
00:58:59,516 --> 00:59:01,279
Nice fire.

825
00:59:03,253 --> 00:59:05,244
Did sheeni tell you that was me?

826
00:59:05,422 --> 00:59:07,151
She didn't have to.

827
00:59:07,757 --> 00:59:10,419
Why?
Was l an arsonist in a previous life?

828
00:59:10,594 --> 00:59:11,993
No...

829
00:59:12,162 --> 00:59:14,153
...but sheeni was.

830
00:59:27,377 --> 00:59:29,072
That's very good.

831
00:59:30,113 --> 00:59:32,411
l spoke with Taggard on the phone
this morning.

832
00:59:32,582 --> 00:59:35,415
She requested l send a wallet-sized
photograph for her wall.

833
00:59:35,852 --> 00:59:37,979
-So did they get expelled?
-No.

834
00:59:38,154 --> 00:59:41,089
Taggard was able to convince
the matron it was innocent.

835
00:59:41,258 --> 00:59:43,089
innocent? Are you kidding me?

836
00:59:43,260 --> 00:59:46,525
l could have cut the sexual intercourse
in that room with a knife.

837
00:59:49,866 --> 00:59:52,300
<i>Francois feels that a man
can only take so much...</i>

838
00:59:52,469 --> 00:59:54,630
<i>...before his dignity demands
he rise up...</i>

839
00:59:54,804 --> 00:59:57,466
<i>...against an absurd
and unjust universe.</i>

840
00:59:57,641 --> 01:00:00,235
<i>l'm going to need a partner in crime.</i>

841
01:00:00,744 --> 01:00:02,143
<i>''Dear Bernice...</i>

842
01:00:02,312 --> 01:00:04,678
<i>...it was nice meeting you
in the bathroom.</i>

843
01:00:04,848 --> 01:00:06,782
<i>l hope your stomach has settled.</i>

844
01:00:06,950 --> 01:00:09,384
<i>l know you informed the matron
of our presence...</i>

845
01:00:09,552 --> 01:00:11,747
<i>...but l want you to know
l hold no grudge.</i>

846
01:00:11,922 --> 01:00:14,789
<i>You were still upset from hearing
all the horrible things...</i>

847
01:00:14,958 --> 01:00:18,621
<i>... Trent has been saying about you
and probably weren't yourself.</i>

848
01:00:18,795 --> 01:00:20,990
<i>l think Trent needs to be
taught a lesson...</i>

849
01:00:21,164 --> 01:00:24,190
<i>...for calling you a fat cow
and an ugly whore.</i>

850
01:00:24,367 --> 01:00:27,894
<i>l suggest you take revenge by
getting sheeni kicked out of school.</i>

851
01:00:28,071 --> 01:00:31,438
<i>Everyone knows it would crush Trent
if she were sent away.</i>

852
01:00:31,608 --> 01:00:34,577
<i>How to get her kicked out of school,
you may ask?</i>

853
01:00:34,844 --> 01:00:38,007
<i>l have included a number of
sleeping pills with this note.</i>

854
01:00:38,181 --> 01:00:42,083
<i>You must introduce one into her
breakfast beverage each morning.</i>

855
01:00:42,252 --> 01:00:46,018
<i>She may be intelligent and beautiful,
but is not likely to pass her courses...</i>

856
01:00:46,189 --> 01:00:48,851
<i>...if she is falling asleep in class.</i>

857
01:00:49,025 --> 01:00:51,721
<i>Since meeting you,
l realize my interest in sheeni...</i>

858
01:00:51,895 --> 01:00:54,455
<i>...was merely
an adolescent infatuation.</i>

859
01:00:54,631 --> 01:00:57,464
<i>You seem like a much more
genuine person.</i>

860
01:00:57,634 --> 01:01:00,228
<i>Do you suppose there is any truth
to the rumours...</i>

861
01:01:00,403 --> 01:01:03,600
<i>...that Trent lost his virginity
to his first cousin?</i>

862
01:01:03,773 --> 01:01:07,402
<i>Perhaps you should ask around
and see if anyone else heard that.</i>

863
01:01:07,577 --> 01:01:10,978
<i>Be strong, Bernice. Take courage.</i>

864
01:01:11,147 --> 01:01:14,718
<i>Affectionately yours, Nick Twisp. ''</i>

865
01:01:24,527 --> 01:01:25,619
Hi, folks.

866
01:01:26,496 --> 01:01:27,520
Hi, Nick.

867
01:01:29,666 --> 01:01:31,998
l didn't realize
you two knew each other.

868
01:01:32,168 --> 01:01:35,035
We met the other day
and got to talking...

869
01:01:35,205 --> 01:01:37,139
...and realized we both know you.

870
01:01:37,307 --> 01:01:40,242
isn’t life funny?
Paul, don't you think?

871
01:01:41,211 --> 01:01:43,406
Only slightly.

872
01:01:43,580 --> 01:01:45,844
We saved you some mushrooms,
Nick.

873
01:01:46,016 --> 01:01:47,881
it’s going to change your life.

874
01:01:48,051 --> 01:01:50,781
Yeah, they're pretty powerful,
so only take two.

875
01:02:33,663 --> 01:02:35,324
Have fun.

876
01:04:03,453 --> 01:04:05,353
Lacy.

877
01:04:05,955 --> 01:04:07,786
What in fuck are you people doing?

878
01:04:08,558 --> 01:04:11,288
Nick, what the fuck is going on?

879
01:04:11,461 --> 01:04:14,555
Okay, George. Just calm down now.

880
01:04:14,731 --> 01:04:16,221
Who they--? What--?

881
01:04:16,399 --> 01:04:18,890
Calm down before the neighbours
call the sheriff.

882
01:04:21,538 --> 01:04:23,028
Okay, Lacy, come on.

883
01:04:27,010 --> 01:04:28,875
Okay. You can get up? Yeah.

884
01:04:29,045 --> 01:04:31,206
Get your hands off me,
you fuck.

885
01:04:31,381 --> 01:04:34,646
-Easy, George.
-Fuck.

886
01:04:35,385 --> 01:04:36,579
Fuck.

887
01:04:36,753 --> 01:04:38,846
l apologize.

888
01:04:45,628 --> 01:04:47,220
Bye, guys.

889
01:04:48,665 --> 01:04:50,633
Bye, Nicky.

890
01:04:51,234 --> 01:04:53,896
You know, sheeni’s coming home
for Thanksgiving dinner.

891
01:04:54,070 --> 01:04:55,901
You should be there.

892
01:04:56,072 --> 01:04:58,006
But, Paul, your parents despise me.

893
01:04:58,942 --> 01:05:01,809
Dinner's at 2. Hope you like turkey.

894
01:05:01,978 --> 01:05:03,240
l love it.

895
01:05:16,726 --> 01:05:18,557
<i>-Hello?
-Nick.</i>

896
01:05:18,728 --> 01:05:20,525
<i>-Hi, Mom. What's up?
-How are you?</i>

897
01:05:20,697 --> 01:05:21,891
l'm fine, Mom.

898
01:05:22,065 --> 01:05:24,124
Lance and l are through.

899
01:05:24,300 --> 01:05:26,131
He was being very rude to me.

900
01:05:26,302 --> 01:05:28,702
And at my age,
l don't have to stand for that.

901
01:05:28,871 --> 01:05:30,270
That's good to hear, Mom.

902
01:05:30,440 --> 01:05:32,806
Maybe you should
try and be single for a while.

903
01:05:32,976 --> 01:05:35,274
Romances don't seem to be
your calling in life.

904
01:05:36,045 --> 01:05:38,104
Listen, Nicky,
when Lance stormed out...

905
01:05:38,281 --> 01:05:40,442
...he said he was through
covering for you.

906
01:05:40,617 --> 01:05:43,177
<i>The Berkeley police
know that you set that fire...</i>

907
01:05:43,353 --> 01:05:45,150
<i>...and Lance told them
where you are.</i>

908
01:05:46,256 --> 01:05:48,486
Nicky, they're coming to arrest you.

909
01:05:51,060 --> 01:05:54,029
Okay, Mom. Thanks for calling.
Happy Thanksgiving.

910
01:06:01,037 --> 01:06:04,370
You're still going over there?
We need to get out town.

911
01:06:04,540 --> 01:06:06,565
What about sheeni?

912
01:06:06,743 --> 01:06:07,801
Think.

913
01:06:07,977 --> 01:06:10,969
is this bitch worth going to jail for?

914
01:06:32,635 --> 01:06:33,727
-Oh, hi, Nick.
-Hi, Paul.

915
01:06:33,903 --> 01:06:35,461
Right on time. Come on in.

916
01:06:35,638 --> 01:06:37,538
l brought some maple bars
for dessert.

917
01:06:37,707 --> 01:06:39,299
-Fantastic.
-They're really good.

918
01:06:39,475 --> 01:06:41,773
-They smell good.
-Hello.

919
01:06:41,944 --> 01:06:44,913
-Happy Thanksgiving, Nicky.
-Oh, hey, Lacy.

920
01:06:45,081 --> 01:06:46,412
l brought some maple bars.

921
01:06:46,582 --> 01:06:48,174
Oh, thank you. l'll set them out.

922
01:06:48,351 --> 01:06:51,878
Mr. and Mrs. Saunders,
you remember Nick, don't you?

923
01:06:55,024 --> 01:06:56,423
Hi.

924
01:06:59,862 --> 01:07:02,831
Paul served them
an appetizer earlier.

925
01:07:03,066 --> 01:07:05,091
Stuffed mushrooms.

926
01:07:12,241 --> 01:07:13,538
Hey.

927
01:07:14,811 --> 01:07:16,210
Nick.

928
01:07:16,379 --> 01:07:17,869
sheeni.

929
01:07:18,981 --> 01:07:22,280
What's wrong? What's wrong?

930
01:07:22,452 --> 01:07:23,919
What?

931
01:07:25,655 --> 01:07:27,919
l was expelled.

932
01:07:29,325 --> 01:07:32,419
What? Why?

933
01:07:33,830 --> 01:07:36,025
For falling asleep in class.

934
01:07:36,199 --> 01:07:38,064
For my grades.

935
01:07:38,234 --> 01:07:42,330
l'm stuck back here with my parents
in this horrible trailer.

936
01:07:42,505 --> 01:07:45,804
My brother's lost his mind.
He's drugged everyone.

937
01:07:48,077 --> 01:07:51,012
-Let's get out of here.
-What?

938
01:07:52,215 --> 01:07:54,342
Let's run away together.

939
01:07:55,451 --> 01:07:59,046
The police are after me.
They know that l started the fire.

940
01:07:59,222 --> 01:08:02,623
But we could be outlaws together,
just like we planned.

941
01:08:05,962 --> 01:08:09,523
-l have to think.
-sheeni. Dinner's ready.

942
01:08:15,972 --> 01:08:18,702
-Everything's delicious.
-Paul prepared the entire meal.

943
01:08:19,308 --> 01:08:23,938
He just loves all the traditional
Thanksgiving foods.

944
01:08:31,087 --> 01:08:34,579
Well, l hope it's the first of many
such occasions for myself.

945
01:08:38,528 --> 01:08:41,497
-l'll get it.
-is someone here?

946
01:08:46,436 --> 01:08:48,233
-Trent.
-Happy Thanksgiving, sweetie.

947
01:08:48,404 --> 01:08:50,395
-What are you doing here?
-Can l come in?

948
01:08:50,573 --> 01:08:51,972
Of course.

949
01:08:53,910 --> 01:08:55,138
Hello, everyone.

950
01:08:58,080 --> 01:09:00,241
Trent, this is Lacy, Paul's friend.

951
01:09:00,416 --> 01:09:03,544
Yes, we've met before
at my father's office.

952
01:09:03,719 --> 01:09:05,653
-Yes.
-You're looking wonderful, Lacy.

953
01:09:05,822 --> 01:09:07,813
Oh, thank you.

954
01:09:07,990 --> 01:09:09,389
-Happy Thanksgiving.
-You too.

955
01:09:09,559 --> 01:09:11,322
it’s great to see you.

956
01:09:11,494 --> 01:09:13,155
And this is Nick.

957
01:09:15,097 --> 01:09:16,496
Hello, Nick.

958
01:09:16,666 --> 01:09:18,224
Hello, Trent.

959
01:09:18,401 --> 01:09:19,834
Have a seat, Trent.

960
01:09:20,002 --> 01:09:22,197
l'm sorry, sheeni, but l can't.

961
01:09:22,371 --> 01:09:24,305
in fact, l have a bit of bad news.

962
01:09:24,474 --> 01:09:25,634
What is it?

963
01:09:25,808 --> 01:09:30,040
l searched the room of Bernice Lynch
thoroughly from top to bottom.

964
01:09:30,980 --> 01:09:33,813
Did you obtain proper authorization
from school officials?

965
01:09:33,983 --> 01:09:36,884
No, Nick.
l acted on my own initiative.

966
01:09:37,053 --> 01:09:40,181
l was curious as to why
a girl as sweet as Bernice...

967
01:09:40,356 --> 01:09:42,688
...would colour me
in such an unflattering light.

968
01:09:42,859 --> 01:09:45,293
in Bernice's closet, l found...

969
01:09:45,461 --> 01:09:47,326
...this letter.

970
01:09:50,900 --> 01:09:54,563
in the letter, the writer expresses
a strong affection for Bernice...

971
01:09:54,737 --> 01:09:57,797
...and instructs her to begin a program
of sedating sheeni...

972
01:09:57,974 --> 01:10:01,068
...with drugs that he himself
supplied.

973
01:10:01,244 --> 01:10:04,372
Nicky, you didn't.
You could have killed me.

974
01:10:04,547 --> 01:10:06,879
-Oh, Nicky.
-Bad break, Nick.

975
01:10:07,483 --> 01:10:09,974
-Who died?
-No one yet, Mrs. Saunders.

976
01:10:10,152 --> 01:10:12,916
-Arrest him.
-l can't arrest him.

977
01:10:13,089 --> 01:10:16,889
l have called the Santa Cruz police.
They're on their way here right now.

978
01:10:18,528 --> 01:10:20,689
Well, l'll be leaving.

979
01:10:21,364 --> 01:10:22,956
Please continue without me.

980
01:10:29,205 --> 01:10:30,866
Nick.

981
01:10:31,040 --> 01:10:32,871
l would advise you to remain here...

982
01:10:33,042 --> 01:10:36,307
...and face the consequences
of your actions like a man.

983
01:10:37,647 --> 01:10:40,980
Well, thank you
for that unsolicited counsel, Trent.

984
01:10:41,317 --> 01:10:43,342
And please do drop dead.

985
01:10:48,691 --> 01:10:50,124
Goodbye, sheeni.

986
01:12:37,333 --> 01:12:40,791
l need your help. We need to hurry.
We need to get out of here, okay?

987
01:12:40,970 --> 01:12:43,871
-We need to leave.
-Nick, where the hell have you been?

988
01:12:44,040 --> 01:12:45,803
The cops were looking for you.

989
01:12:45,975 --> 01:12:48,239
They barged in,
found my illegal satellite dish--

990
01:12:48,411 --> 01:12:51,812
We need to go right now.
l need you to put me up in a motel.

991
01:12:51,981 --> 01:12:53,744
Are you fucking crazy?

992
01:12:53,916 --> 01:12:56,350
Do you expect me to let you
get away with all this?

993
01:12:56,519 --> 01:12:58,248
That's it. l'm calling the cops.

994
01:12:58,421 --> 01:13:00,912
Dad, you're going to send
your only son to prison?

995
01:13:01,090 --> 01:13:04,526
Hey, l don't need a lecture
from a fucking arsonist.

996
01:13:04,694 --> 01:13:07,094
At least give me your car
so l can get out of here.

997
01:13:07,263 --> 01:13:10,596
lf you think l'm going to give you my car
you got another thing coming.

998
01:13:13,002 --> 01:13:14,230
Dad!

999
01:13:14,403 --> 01:13:16,735
You're not a little kid anymore.

1000
01:13:17,540 --> 01:13:19,531
You got to face the music, Nick.

1001
01:13:19,709 --> 01:13:21,176
Dad.

1002
01:13:32,121 --> 01:13:33,554
Nick.

1003
01:13:36,525 --> 01:13:37,787
Open this door, Nick.

1004
01:13:37,960 --> 01:13:40,520
l'm warning you, don't you do this.

1005
01:13:42,131 --> 01:13:43,564
Nick.

1006
01:13:43,799 --> 01:13:46,768
Open this door. You open this--

1007
01:13:48,671 --> 01:13:49,797
Nick, get back here.

1008
01:13:49,972 --> 01:13:52,133
You stop this car right now,
l'm warning you.

1009
01:13:52,308 --> 01:13:55,277
You're in trouble!

1010
01:14:19,268 --> 01:14:21,395
We stopping to admire the scenery
or something?

1011
01:14:21,570 --> 01:14:24,505
-l don't want to leave without sheeni.
-Cut the shit.

1012
01:14:24,673 --> 01:14:27,301
l can live as a woman.
l can change my name to Carlotta.

1013
01:14:27,476 --> 01:14:29,239
Why don't you start the fucking car?

1014
01:14:29,411 --> 01:14:33,108
l can't leave with her hating me.
l have to go back.

1015
01:14:33,282 --> 01:14:35,716
l have to tell her that everything l did
was for her.

1016
01:14:35,885 --> 01:14:37,785
Let me paint you
a little picture, Nick.

1017
01:14:37,953 --> 01:14:41,286
You go back, they bust you,
you go to jail.

1018
01:14:41,457 --> 01:14:43,948
sheeni goes on with her life.

1019
01:14:44,126 --> 01:14:45,753
Fuck sheeni.

1020
01:15:00,543 --> 01:15:01,601
All right.

1021
01:15:01,777 --> 01:15:04,405
l'm going to help you
get back to your lady.

1022
01:15:05,080 --> 01:15:07,207
But you better get laid this time.

1023
01:15:07,383 --> 01:15:11,149
lf you end up going to jail a virgin,
l won't be sticking around.

1024
01:15:11,320 --> 01:15:14,118
Now give me 25 cents, Carlotta.

1025
01:15:28,237 --> 01:15:31,365
<i>-Officer Lance Westcott, please.
-One moment.</i>

1026
01:15:33,075 --> 01:15:34,372
<i>Officer Westcott.</i>

1027
01:15:34,543 --> 01:15:36,101
Hey, asshole, it's me.

1028
01:15:36,278 --> 01:15:39,907
<i>Nick. You little shit.
You know you're going to jail, right?</i>

1029
01:15:40,082 --> 01:15:42,209
l'm calling to make it easy for you.

1030
01:15:42,384 --> 01:15:44,750
Hazel Park, one hour.
Round up your friends.

1031
01:15:44,920 --> 01:15:47,480
l'm turning myself in. Fuck you.

1032
01:15:49,124 --> 01:15:51,422
Holy shit, you've lost your mind.

1033
01:15:54,897 --> 01:15:56,159
Wait.

1034
01:18:07,529 --> 01:18:11,989
<i>--patience is beginning to wear thin
and they understand why.</i>

1035
01:18:12,167 --> 01:18:13,191
<i>Terrence?</i>

1036
01:18:13,369 --> 01:18:15,963
<i>The measure goes before
the full state legislature...</i>

1037
01:18:16,138 --> 01:18:17,901
<i>...at the end of the current session.</i>

1038
01:18:18,073 --> 01:18:19,404
<i>Repeating our top story...</i>

1039
01:18:19,575 --> 01:18:23,534
<i>...a police source has identified
Nicholas Twisp as a suspect...</i>

1040
01:18:23,712 --> 01:18:26,806
<i>...in last September's massive fire
in downtown Berkeley.</i>

1041
01:18:27,750 --> 01:18:31,584
<i>We have an exclusive interview with
one of Twisp's former classmates.</i>

1042
01:18:31,754 --> 01:18:34,689
<i>l just hope that society
isn't too severe in judging Nicholas.</i>

1043
01:18:34,857 --> 01:18:39,760
<i>So often my generation is portrayed
as a juvenile and wasteful group.</i>

1044
01:18:39,928 --> 01:18:41,486
<i>He needs help.</i>

1045
01:18:41,663 --> 01:18:44,063
<i>And he's better off
in the hands of the authorities.</i>

1046
01:18:44,233 --> 01:18:46,565
<i>Twisp is 5'9'', 1 35 pounds...</i>

1047
01:18:46,735 --> 01:18:49,465
<i>...with brown eyes, dirty-blond hair
and a pale complexion.</i>

1048
01:18:49,638 --> 01:18:51,663
<i>He was last seen
in the vicinity of Ukiah.</i>

1049
01:18:53,108 --> 01:18:54,439
Who's that?

1050
01:18:56,779 --> 01:19:00,180
Hello, Mrs. Saunders. l'm Carlotta,
sheeni’s friend from school.

1051
01:19:00,349 --> 01:19:01,907
Oh, hello there.

1052
01:19:02,084 --> 01:19:05,781
l've come to memorize church hymns
with sheeni for this Sunday's services.

1053
01:19:05,954 --> 01:19:07,922
sheeni’s coming to church?

1054
01:19:08,090 --> 01:19:10,081
That's my understanding, yeah.

1055
01:19:10,259 --> 01:19:12,887
Oh, well, please do come in.

1056
01:19:13,062 --> 01:19:15,587
Thank you. Thank you.

1057
01:19:15,764 --> 01:19:16,788
sheeni?

1058
01:19:17,800 --> 01:19:20,200
Your friend Carlotta's here.

1059
01:19:20,369 --> 01:19:21,427
Phil, this is Carlotta.

1060
01:19:21,703 --> 01:19:25,696
She says that sheeni’s
coming to church with her on Sunday.

1061
01:19:25,874 --> 01:19:27,535
Well, nice to meet you, young lady.

1062
01:19:27,709 --> 01:19:30,143
Nice to meet you, Mr. Saunders.

1063
01:19:31,747 --> 01:19:33,442
Hello, sheeni.

1064
01:19:34,483 --> 01:19:36,383
Hello, Carlotta.

1065
01:19:38,454 --> 01:19:40,183
May l come up?

1066
01:19:47,963 --> 01:19:49,897
You got me expelled.

1067
01:19:50,065 --> 01:19:51,760
l'm sorry, sheeni.

1068
01:19:51,934 --> 01:19:54,767
Do you realize what life is like
for me here?

1069
01:19:54,937 --> 01:19:56,632
Do you have any idea?

1070
01:19:56,805 --> 01:19:59,638
sheeni, l've been alone
my whole life.

1071
01:19:59,842 --> 01:20:01,810
l do know what it's like.

1072
01:20:04,746 --> 01:20:07,271
l burned down Berkeley for you.

1073
01:20:08,117 --> 01:20:10,244
l destroyed both of my parents' cars.

1074
01:20:12,354 --> 01:20:16,222
l've lied and manipulated
and had you sedated.

1075
01:20:16,859 --> 01:20:18,656
l did all that so that...

1076
01:20:18,827 --> 01:20:21,261
...we wouldn't have to be
alone anymore.

1077
01:20:30,672 --> 01:20:32,697
You're him, aren't you?

1078
01:20:32,875 --> 01:20:34,137
l'm him?

1079
01:20:34,309 --> 01:20:36,300
You're my Francois.

1080
01:20:36,912 --> 01:20:39,642
You're the one l've been looking for.

1081
01:20:45,854 --> 01:20:47,116
sheeni...

1082
01:20:47,289 --> 01:20:49,416
...l want what you want.

1083
01:20:49,591 --> 01:20:52,856
l want to live all over the world
and have adventures.

1084
01:20:55,230 --> 01:20:57,061
But l'm not Francois.

1085
01:20:58,901 --> 01:21:02,393
l'm the guy who saw you
and fell in love with you...

1086
01:21:02,571 --> 01:21:04,801
...and would do anything for you.

1087
01:21:05,674 --> 01:21:07,505
That's who l am.

1088
01:21:31,633 --> 01:21:33,123
l don't want to give you this...

1089
01:21:33,302 --> 01:21:36,032
...but l don't have anything else
to discard.

1090
01:21:41,543 --> 01:21:43,704
Thank you very much
and here's your change.

1091
01:21:43,879 --> 01:21:47,280
Always shop at....

1092
01:22:29,524 --> 01:22:33,654
it’s a wonder that humankind has
constructed any kind of civilization...

1093
01:22:33,829 --> 01:22:36,923
...with this monumental distraction
at hand.

1094
01:22:43,472 --> 01:22:44,996
Trent.

1095
01:22:45,173 --> 01:22:48,074
-What are you doing here?
-l brought the police.

1096
01:22:48,243 --> 01:22:52,077
l wasn't fooled for one second
when l saw that ugly girl walking up.

1097
01:22:52,247 --> 01:22:55,410
-You were lurking outside my house?
-Of course.

1098
01:22:55,584 --> 01:22:57,279
Protecting you.

1099
01:22:57,886 --> 01:23:00,218
Trent, you're a very nice person...

1100
01:23:00,389 --> 01:23:03,017
...but l just don't have
those feelings for you.

1101
01:23:04,359 --> 01:23:06,953
-You're going to jail.
-l don't want to hurt you.

1102
01:23:07,396 --> 01:23:11,196
l'll only ask once that you and your
adorable sweater step away from the--

1103
01:23:16,004 --> 01:23:17,471
-Son of a bitch.
-Let go of me.

1104
01:23:17,639 --> 01:23:20,631
-Come here, you little shit.
-Get off, you son of a bitch.

1105
01:23:20,809 --> 01:23:23,107
-Get off of me.
-Son of a bitch.

1106
01:23:23,278 --> 01:23:25,576
This is the arsonist.

1107
01:23:25,747 --> 01:23:27,840
All right.

1108
01:23:28,450 --> 01:23:30,714
Just relax.

1109
01:23:30,886 --> 01:23:32,854
it’s over.

1110
01:23:33,021 --> 01:23:35,319
l might be away for a long time,
darling.

1111
01:23:35,490 --> 01:23:37,958
You're 1 6.
You're going to juvenile detention.

1112
01:23:38,126 --> 01:23:41,118
-You'll be out in three months.
-So you'll wait for me?

1113
01:23:43,131 --> 01:23:45,759
Where the hell else am l going to go?

1114
01:24:13,061 --> 01:24:15,689
<i>Well, l'm headed for a stint
in juvenile detention.</i>

1115
01:24:15,864 --> 01:24:20,426
<i>l can at least feel comforted by
the fact that l'm not going in a virgin.</i>

1116
01:24:20,602 --> 01:24:21,762
<i>And at lunchtime...</i>

1117
01:24:21,937 --> 01:24:25,566
<i>...when hardened offenders gather
to swap tales of teenage rebellion...</i>

1118
01:24:25,741 --> 01:24:28,073
<i>...l bet they'll find mine hard to top.</i>

1119
01:24:33,715 --> 01:24:35,615
<i>sheeni says she'll wait for me...</i>

1120
01:24:35,784 --> 01:24:39,083
<i>...and that when l'm released,
we'll finally be together and free.</i>

1121
01:24:39,254 --> 01:24:41,552
<i>And l believe her.</i>

1122
01:24:44,426 --> 01:24:47,884
<i>l can feel in my heart that sheeni
is in love with me.</i>

1123
01:24:48,063 --> 01:24:50,998
<i>Not with some fantasy lover
in a French romantic novel...</i>

1124
01:24:51,166 --> 01:24:52,497
<i>...but with me...</i>

1125
01:24:52,667 --> 01:24:54,100
<i>...Nick Twisp.</i>

1126
01:24:55,137 --> 01:24:56,627
<i>it’s funny.</i>

1127
01:24:56,805 --> 01:24:58,204
<i>After all that...</i>

1128
01:24:58,907 --> 01:25:01,239
<i>...Nick Twisp was enough.</i>
