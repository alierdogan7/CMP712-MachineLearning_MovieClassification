1
00:01:42,202 --> 00:01:43,469
Your Majesty.

2
00:01:44,571 --> 00:01:46,405
Papa,
we've made you breakfast.

3
00:01:46,407 --> 00:01:48,540
Only Francoise is too little
to carry the tray,

4
00:01:48,542 --> 00:01:49,942
so we have
Philippe to help.

5
00:01:49,944 --> 00:01:52,144
Yes, Uncle.
I am the strongest.

6
00:01:52,146 --> 00:01:53,712
I could carry it.

7
00:01:53,714 --> 00:01:55,647
My queen.
Good morning, Majesty.

8
00:01:58,218 --> 00:02:00,819
Be it known
that we intend to hold court

9
00:02:00,821 --> 00:02:03,288
at the Palace of Versailles

10
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:05,290
within the coming month of May.

11
00:02:05,825 --> 00:02:08,827
Clap.

12
00:02:08,829 --> 00:02:11,630
Do you see how important it is to 
elicit the appropriate response?

13
00:02:11,632 --> 00:02:12,998
Yes.

14
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,334
To this auspicious end,

15
00:02:15,336 --> 00:02:17,669
the finest examples of humanity

16
00:02:17,671 --> 00:02:21,106
shall embody
the true glory of France

17
00:02:21,108 --> 00:02:25,511
in a palace of eternal
and resounding splendor.

18
00:02:25,513 --> 00:02:27,312
Take note.

19
00:02:27,314 --> 00:02:28,981
Your eloquence they must love,

20
00:02:28,983 --> 00:02:30,949
your demeanor they must fear.

21
00:02:30,951 --> 00:02:33,252
I have further commanded

22
00:02:33,254 --> 00:02:37,589
that the greatest masters of 
France will realize this vision

23
00:02:37,591 --> 00:02:41,193
unparalleled in
the history of the world

24
00:02:41,195 --> 00:02:44,363
in gardens of exquisite

25
00:02:44,998 --> 00:02:47,099
and matchless beauty.

26
00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:52,371
Heaven

27
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:55,374
shall be here.

28
00:03:58,571 --> 00:04:00,171
The light is fading, master.

29
00:04:04,677 --> 00:04:05,911
Torches!

30
00:05:03,836 --> 00:05:04,870
<i>Madame?</i>

31
00:05:27,694 --> 00:05:28,860
Is it?

32
00:05:29,829 --> 00:05:31,563
A week tomorrow at 11:00.

33
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:35,033
Don't forget about the length.

34
00:05:35,035 --> 00:05:37,636
If you stand on the hem,
you'll rip it at the waist.

35
00:05:37,638 --> 00:05:39,204
It's pinching me here.

36
00:06:36,262 --> 00:06:37,729
Thank you.

37
00:06:54,547 --> 00:06:56,615
<i>Master Le Notre,</i>

38
00:06:56,617 --> 00:07:00,352
<i>I am delighted to
make your acquaintance.</i>

39
00:07:00,354 --> 00:07:02,454
<i>I've long been
an admirer of your work.</i>

40
00:07:02,456 --> 00:07:03,456
<i>Le Notre?</i>

41
00:07:04,791 --> 00:07:06,792
Too clever by half,
if you ask me.

42
00:07:06,794 --> 00:07:08,960
And riding
on his father's name.

43
00:07:09,796 --> 00:07:13,398
The strategy I employ
is to imitate.

44
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:15,467
They cannot resist flattery.

45
00:07:15,469 --> 00:07:17,789
'Tis all vanity
to these bigwigs.

46
00:07:18,971 --> 00:07:21,706
Of course, once you're in,
you must have the talent.

47
00:07:22,642 --> 00:07:24,109
Speaking of vanity,

48
00:07:25,077 --> 00:07:27,517
there's a hat,
now, gentlemen.

49
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:31,983
Who is this person?

50
00:07:31,985 --> 00:07:33,118
That's <i> Madame</i> de Barra.

51
00:07:34,921 --> 00:07:36,988
I'm astounded by that.

52
00:08:02,181 --> 00:08:04,749
<i>Monsieur</i> Mauve's plans.

53
00:08:07,854 --> 00:08:10,322
How many more candidates,
Claude?

54
00:08:10,324 --> 00:08:13,364
Three more,
<i>monsieur,</i> after this one,
but the end is in sight.

55
00:08:15,027 --> 00:08:18,964
Dullness or disrespect,
that is my apparent choice.

56
00:08:18,966 --> 00:08:20,632
If the king's demands
were not so vast,

57
00:08:20,634 --> 00:08:22,334
I would build
the gardens myself.

58
00:08:22,336 --> 00:08:23,635
Indeed, master.

59
00:08:23,637 --> 00:08:25,270
And in the meantime...

60
00:08:32,011 --> 00:08:33,545
<i>Monsieur</i> Mauve.

61
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:35,547
<i>Madame</i> de Barra.

62
00:08:36,549 --> 00:08:37,782
<i>Monsieur</i> Duras.

63
00:08:39,285 --> 00:08:41,219
That a new coat?
The wife's idea.

64
00:08:41,221 --> 00:08:42,721
Be covered in mud
by Tuesday,

65
00:08:42,723 --> 00:08:44,322
but by then she thinks
we'll have this job,

66
00:08:44,324 --> 00:08:46,291
so the coat will have been
a worthwhile extravagance.

67
00:08:46,293 --> 00:08:47,493
Sound reasoning.

68
00:08:47,494 --> 00:08:50,195
Gentlemen,
I've not had the pleasure.

69
00:08:50,197 --> 00:08:53,164
Jean Risse
and Daniel Le Vielle,

70
00:08:53,166 --> 00:08:54,399
<i>Madame</i> Sabine de Barra.

71
00:08:54,401 --> 00:08:56,501
You're all here
for the interview?

72
00:08:56,503 --> 00:08:57,802
We are, and you?

73
00:08:57,804 --> 00:08:59,304
The same.

74
00:08:59,306 --> 00:09:00,705
Been in Paris long, <i> madame?</i>

75
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:02,307
Two years.

76
00:09:02,309 --> 00:09:04,643
And you've worked
for someone before that?

77
00:09:04,645 --> 00:09:07,579
I know all the contractors
in the provinces.

78
00:09:07,581 --> 00:09:09,881
All the gentlemen, that is.

79
00:09:09,883 --> 00:09:11,516
There is no gentleman,
<i>monsieur.</i>

80
00:09:11,518 --> 00:09:12,758
I work for myself.

81
00:09:15,988 --> 00:09:17,489
We all to be interviewed
at this time?

82
00:09:17,491 --> 00:09:18,657
We're here early

83
00:09:18,659 --> 00:09:20,759
to spy out
the other candidates.

84
00:09:20,761 --> 00:09:23,028
I've been in already.
Oh, how did you fare?

85
00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:24,563
Spent upwards
of an hour with him.

86
00:09:24,565 --> 00:09:27,766
Very detailed examination
of the work, so, you know,
we shall see.

87
00:09:27,768 --> 00:09:29,234
You must have impressed him.

88
00:09:29,236 --> 00:09:30,569
I worked for his father.

89
00:09:30,571 --> 00:09:32,771
I'm not disheartened.

90
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,714
He seems not disheartened, too.

91
00:09:42,716 --> 00:09:44,149
<i>Madame</i> de Barra.

92
00:09:46,052 --> 00:09:47,686
Well, gentlemen.

93
00:09:47,688 --> 00:09:48,688
Best of fates to you.

94
00:09:50,056 --> 00:09:51,690
Claude Moulin, <i> madame.</i>

95
00:09:51,692 --> 00:09:53,858
Secretary to Master Le Notre.

96
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:55,427
Have you met
the master before?

97
00:09:55,429 --> 00:09:56,528
I have not.

98
00:10:23,089 --> 00:10:24,422
<i>Madame.</i>

99
00:10:24,424 --> 00:10:25,424
Sir.

100
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:29,493
I'm delighted to
make your acquaintance.

101
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:32,964
I have long been
an admirer of your work.

102
00:10:32,966 --> 00:10:34,766
I am so pleased to attend...

103
00:10:34,768 --> 00:10:36,601
These are your plans,
<i>madame?</i>

104
00:10:36,603 --> 00:10:39,337
Yes. Some are to be
seen around the country.

105
00:10:39,339 --> 00:10:41,106
Others are still in progress,

106
00:10:41,108 --> 00:10:43,775
not yet completed.

107
00:10:43,777 --> 00:10:48,446
However, as required,
there are two sets of plans
to your instructions.

108
00:10:48,448 --> 00:10:50,448
The fifth and sixth,
I believe.

109
00:10:52,685 --> 00:10:53,918
Perhaps at the bottom...

110
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,320
I have examined them.

111
00:10:56,589 --> 00:10:58,690
Ah. So...

112
00:10:58,692 --> 00:11:00,158
May I ask you a question,
<i>madame?</i>

113
00:11:01,594 --> 00:11:02,694
By all means, master.

114
00:11:02,696 --> 00:11:04,229
Are you a believer in order?

115
00:11:05,464 --> 00:11:08,033
Order?
Order over landscape?

116
00:11:09,535 --> 00:11:10,969
Well, I admire it.

117
00:11:10,971 --> 00:11:13,371
Looking at these plans,
there seems to be no trace.

118
00:11:15,508 --> 00:11:16,748
I would not agree.

119
00:11:18,144 --> 00:11:19,544
I think there is
pattern enough

120
00:11:19,546 --> 00:11:21,546
in number six
to suggest absolutely...

121
00:11:21,548 --> 00:11:24,849
Do you believe
in order over landscape?

122
00:11:30,656 --> 00:11:34,759
Order seems to demand
that we look back to
Rome or to the Renaissance.

123
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:39,297
What I'm saying is,
surely,

124
00:11:39,299 --> 00:11:42,367
isn't there something
uniquely French

125
00:11:42,369 --> 00:11:44,569
as yet not celebrated
by us?

126
00:11:47,006 --> 00:11:49,507
Which needs the rules
of order to attain it.

127
00:11:49,509 --> 00:11:50,875
All of my work

128
00:11:52,178 --> 00:11:55,346
is based on a principle
you choose to deny.

129
00:11:55,348 --> 00:11:57,182
I wonder that
you tender yourself

130
00:11:57,184 --> 00:11:59,484
for a position with
someone you believe

131
00:12:01,053 --> 00:12:02,253
to be outdated.

132
00:12:02,255 --> 00:12:04,322
Sir, I...

133
00:12:04,324 --> 00:12:05,857
I have nothing
but admiration

134
00:12:05,859 --> 00:12:07,058
for the scale of your work.

135
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:09,027
You were the first
to use such techniques.

136
00:12:09,029 --> 00:12:13,098
I must apologize
for any insult that
I may have unwittingly

137
00:12:15,334 --> 00:12:16,501
offered you.

138
00:12:16,503 --> 00:12:18,236
Perhaps, <i> madame,</i>

139
00:12:18,238 --> 00:12:19,604
when you have been
in the public eye

140
00:12:19,606 --> 00:12:20,739
and available for ridicule

141
00:12:20,741 --> 00:12:22,440
for as long
as my family has,

142
00:12:22,442 --> 00:12:24,943
you will think again
about this conversation.

143
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:28,980
Good day to you.

144
00:12:36,956 --> 00:12:39,116
Three minutes,
would you say?

145
00:13:23,169 --> 00:13:24,969
How was the interview?
Well?

146
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:28,206
Not so well.

147
00:14:32,071 --> 00:14:33,972
You have a preferred
candidate, master?

148
00:14:36,842 --> 00:14:39,077
The king wants to
improve on perfection

149
00:14:39,079 --> 00:14:40,279
and reach for the impossible.

150
00:14:41,814 --> 00:14:44,515
I'm surrounded by barbarians.

151
00:14:44,517 --> 00:14:47,085
No doubt it's death
if I fail him.

152
00:14:47,087 --> 00:14:48,653
Prison, more like.

153
00:14:48,655 --> 00:14:51,389
Get your hands dirty,
see what grows.

154
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:53,391
That's what your father
would have done.

155
00:14:57,363 --> 00:15:00,431
You once said,
"No man, however grand,

156
00:15:00,433 --> 00:15:02,734
"knows what he wants
until you give it to him."

157
00:15:03,502 --> 00:15:04,602
True.

158
00:16:14,073 --> 00:16:15,513
<i>A gentleman wishes to see you.</i>

159
00:16:15,941 --> 00:16:17,775
<i>Monsieur</i> Le Notre.

160
00:16:17,777 --> 00:16:19,577
Here?
Don't worry, I'll stay.

161
00:16:20,245 --> 00:16:21,913
Come on.

162
00:16:21,915 --> 00:16:22,915
Oh!
Here.

163
00:16:23,615 --> 00:16:24,855
Go on.

164
00:16:37,496 --> 00:16:39,856
<i>Madame</i> will be
with you presently.

165
00:18:50,062 --> 00:18:52,563
My father taught me gardening.

166
00:18:52,565 --> 00:18:54,999
He encouraged me
to see beauty
and re-create it,

167
00:18:55,001 --> 00:18:57,568
not as an exercise,
more as an act of faith.

168
00:18:59,071 --> 00:19:03,107
He told me that
God put us first
into a garden,

169
00:19:03,109 --> 00:19:07,512
and when we lost Eden,
we were fated to search
and reinvent it again,

170
00:19:07,514 --> 00:19:10,481
but only some of us
have the gift
of knowing this.

171
00:19:12,584 --> 00:19:15,386
Only some of us
have that gift.

172
00:19:22,094 --> 00:19:24,395
I spied on you today
before you attended
the interview.

173
00:19:30,302 --> 00:19:31,669
You moved one of my pots.

174
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:35,680
I did.

175
00:19:42,047 --> 00:19:43,281
I was curious.

176
00:19:50,689 --> 00:19:52,957
I will not take up
too much of your time.

177
00:19:54,059 --> 00:19:56,661
I have been looking
again at your plans.

178
00:19:56,663 --> 00:19:58,496
You did not care for them.
I am none the less for it.

179
00:19:58,498 --> 00:20:00,164
In plain truth,
I am used to it.

180
00:20:00,166 --> 00:20:02,733
I did not say
I did not care
for your plans.

181
00:20:02,735 --> 00:20:04,735
I said I could find
no order in them.

182
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:07,972
This abundance of chaos,

183
00:20:08,974 --> 00:20:10,274
this is your Eden?

184
00:20:12,411 --> 00:20:14,512
My search for it.

185
00:20:14,514 --> 00:20:18,149
I spoke today of the pressure
of being in the public eye.

186
00:20:18,151 --> 00:20:21,319
I will spare you
any repetition,
but, <i> madame,</i> in my world,

187
00:20:21,321 --> 00:20:24,655
even anarchy is
by royal command,

188
00:20:24,657 --> 00:20:26,457
and chaos must
adhere to budget.

189
00:20:29,061 --> 00:20:30,094
Good evening.

190
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:57,088
Later, <i> messieurs.</i>

191
00:20:57,090 --> 00:20:58,689
Gentlemen.

192
00:21:08,033 --> 00:21:09,900
Welcome to Versailles.

193
00:21:09,902 --> 00:21:12,536
You found your way here
without too much effort,
I hope.

194
00:21:12,538 --> 00:21:14,639
The map you sent
was wonderfully accurate.

195
00:21:14,641 --> 00:21:16,240
I shall need it to
get back out again.

196
00:21:16,242 --> 00:21:18,209
We shall be
traveling about a bit.

197
00:21:18,211 --> 00:21:21,112
<i>Madame</i> de Barra,
<i>Monsieur</i> Sualem
and De Ville.

198
00:21:21,114 --> 00:21:22,913
They are building
the Marly waterworks

199
00:21:22,915 --> 00:21:24,949
and an aqueduct from
there to Versailles,

200
00:21:24,951 --> 00:21:28,219
which we hope
will alleviate the severe
water shortage here.

201
00:21:28,221 --> 00:21:29,954
<i>Madame.</i>
Gentlemen.

202
00:21:29,956 --> 00:21:31,722
<i>Madame</i> de Barra
will be constructing

203
00:21:31,724 --> 00:21:34,058
the Rockwork Grove
here at Versailles.

204
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:35,760
Water, or rather
the lack of it,

205
00:21:35,762 --> 00:21:37,395
will be a pressing concern.

206
00:21:37,397 --> 00:21:39,096
Master, the king's
ambitions are already...

207
00:21:39,098 --> 00:21:41,732
Are vast and ever changing,
and our task is to meet them.

208
00:21:41,734 --> 00:21:44,969
With respect,
no man can meet
infinite demand.

209
00:21:44,971 --> 00:21:46,504
The king's commands
are not infinite, De Ville.

210
00:21:46,506 --> 00:21:48,272
They are the king's commands.

211
00:21:48,274 --> 00:21:50,508
Well, quite so,
but the aqueduct
can only do so much.

212
00:21:50,510 --> 00:21:51,909
When we began construction,

213
00:21:51,911 --> 00:21:53,411
I was under
the impression that...

214
00:21:53,413 --> 00:21:55,346
The past is history.

215
00:21:55,348 --> 00:21:57,348
Our task is to suppress
nature to our will,

216
00:21:57,350 --> 00:21:59,317
according to the present plans.

217
00:21:59,319 --> 00:22:01,686
But, <i> monsieur,</i>
the money being spent.

218
00:22:01,688 --> 00:22:03,454
The aqueduct will
carry sufficient water

219
00:22:03,456 --> 00:22:05,256
to the gardens
of Versailles
because it must.

220
00:22:05,258 --> 00:22:07,091
That is your brief.

221
00:22:07,093 --> 00:22:08,359
<i>Madame?</i>

222
00:22:10,462 --> 00:22:12,763
It is essentially your plan,

223
00:22:12,765 --> 00:22:16,100
number six in your
submission, I believe.

224
00:22:16,102 --> 00:22:18,436
This part is entirely
original to myself.

225
00:22:20,539 --> 00:22:22,373
You see?

226
00:22:22,375 --> 00:22:24,375
It fits onto this
end of your plan.

227
00:22:26,445 --> 00:22:28,346
Now you can see
the extent
of the enterprise.

228
00:22:28,814 --> 00:22:29,814
Yes.

229
00:22:30,849 --> 00:22:33,718
It's a large, flat area.

230
00:22:36,455 --> 00:22:38,889
An arena with tiered sides.

231
00:22:39,324 --> 00:22:40,624
Indeed.

232
00:22:45,330 --> 00:22:46,764
The orchestra

233
00:22:47,632 --> 00:22:49,066
will be up here.

234
00:22:49,068 --> 00:22:50,301
Orchestra?

235
00:22:51,636 --> 00:22:52,803
A ballroom.

236
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:56,307
It's an outdoor ballroom.

237
00:22:56,309 --> 00:22:57,875
There is a pool of builders.

238
00:22:57,877 --> 00:23:00,378
Select whatever
supplies you care to.

239
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:02,780
Commission
whatever embellishments
you think appropriate.

240
00:23:03,482 --> 00:23:04,982
Time is not unlimited.

241
00:23:06,685 --> 00:23:08,486
Here's the budget.

242
00:23:08,488 --> 00:23:10,054
Try not to exceed it.

243
00:23:18,330 --> 00:23:19,797
Master?

244
00:23:22,667 --> 00:23:23,901
Why me?

245
00:23:26,872 --> 00:23:28,539
These gardens
should be large enough

246
00:23:28,541 --> 00:23:31,809
to embrace voices
other than my own.

247
00:24:19,291 --> 00:24:20,591
<i>Mama!</i>

248
00:24:20,593 --> 00:24:21,826
I'm coming.

249
00:24:43,949 --> 00:24:45,249
<i>Madame</i> de Barra.

250
00:24:45,251 --> 00:24:48,085
<i>Monsieur,</i> forgive me
for disturbing you at home,

251
00:24:48,087 --> 00:24:50,207
but I've been
reworking the plans.

252
00:24:52,190 --> 00:24:55,092
If... If we fill

253
00:24:55,094 --> 00:24:57,161
a reservoir
at the top of the hill,

254
00:24:57,163 --> 00:24:59,029
we would have enough water
to run the fountains

255
00:24:59,031 --> 00:25:02,132
and the building works.

256
00:25:02,134 --> 00:25:05,102
We don't need water
continually if we just
recycle it.

257
00:25:05,104 --> 00:25:07,505
Pressure will force it
back up to the start again.

258
00:25:07,507 --> 00:25:10,541
And there's a river,

259
00:25:12,143 --> 00:25:14,612
here, underground.

260
00:25:15,447 --> 00:25:17,114
May I?
Of course.

261
00:25:23,622 --> 00:25:26,323
Well, thank you, <i> madame.</i>

262
00:25:26,325 --> 00:25:28,225
I will examine
these in more detail.

263
00:25:28,227 --> 00:25:30,461
I must apologize
if this adds to the turmoil.

264
00:25:30,463 --> 00:25:31,695
I am trained to it.

265
00:25:31,697 --> 00:25:33,731
Like a good plant, I submit.

266
00:26:18,510 --> 00:26:20,911
We waited
an hour for a gaming table.

267
00:26:20,913 --> 00:26:23,581
Montespan and Lauzun
had monopolized them.

268
00:26:23,583 --> 00:26:27,084
Anyway, then came the news
her house was on fire.

269
00:26:27,086 --> 00:26:29,253
We felt sure this would
end her winning streak.

270
00:26:29,255 --> 00:26:31,789
Apparently not.
The marquise played on.

271
00:26:31,791 --> 00:26:34,258
Her children were safe,
what could she do?

272
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:37,328
She showed wonderful spirit
and was clapped for it.

273
00:26:39,097 --> 00:26:41,537
How does this dress
look on me, Andre?

274
00:26:42,634 --> 00:26:43,968
Andre, are you listening?

275
00:26:44,803 --> 00:26:46,003
You look very well in it.

276
00:26:47,472 --> 00:26:49,832
What are you studying
that's so important?

277
00:26:50,609 --> 00:26:52,176
Some plans.

278
00:26:53,545 --> 00:26:54,612
Versailles.

279
00:26:57,549 --> 00:26:59,789
Are these the drawings
that woman
brought to the house?

280
00:27:01,586 --> 00:27:03,187
They are.
I see.

281
00:27:06,424 --> 00:27:08,464
Button these
gloves for me, Andre.

282
00:27:17,936 --> 00:27:19,336
Blunt instruments.

283
00:27:21,239 --> 00:27:23,599
Perhaps that's what
makes us a good match.

284
00:27:23,675 --> 00:27:25,442
You're creative,

285
00:27:25,444 --> 00:27:28,112
but unable for the more
delicate maneuvers.

286
00:27:28,114 --> 00:27:29,747
Don't forget that, Andre.

287
00:27:29,749 --> 00:27:31,482
I'm the expert.

288
00:27:31,484 --> 00:27:35,119
You're merely the gardener,
however grand.

289
00:27:35,121 --> 00:27:37,988
Without me to promote
your interests, well,

290
00:27:38,790 --> 00:27:41,225
use your famous imagination.

291
00:28:11,890 --> 00:28:13,690
That's more than
enough for one day.

292
00:28:22,534 --> 00:28:23,654
What...

293
00:28:24,636 --> 00:28:26,503
Where are you...

294
00:28:26,505 --> 00:28:27,705
Where are you going?

295
00:28:32,510 --> 00:28:33,811
Luc?

296
00:29:24,696 --> 00:29:26,830
<i>The sight of you,</i> madame.

297
00:29:28,199 --> 00:29:29,566
What time were you up
this morning?

298
00:29:29,568 --> 00:29:31,301
Did you not sleep again?

299
00:29:31,303 --> 00:29:32,870
I don't remember.

300
00:29:32,872 --> 00:29:34,738
You must take more care.

301
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:36,440
You'll never last
at this rate.

302
00:29:36,442 --> 00:29:38,242
Then what will become of us?

303
00:29:38,244 --> 00:29:41,111
I always
think of something.
Hmm.

304
00:29:41,113 --> 00:29:42,546
Came today.

305
00:29:48,286 --> 00:29:49,653
What does it say?

306
00:29:55,093 --> 00:29:56,193
What does it say?

307
00:30:11,676 --> 00:30:13,310
Anyone you know?

308
00:30:19,484 --> 00:30:20,751
<i>Monsieur</i> Duras.

309
00:30:28,126 --> 00:30:29,626
Need to know your way
around the crews.

310
00:30:29,628 --> 00:30:31,829
Otherwise, you end up
with the wasters.

311
00:30:31,831 --> 00:30:33,630
The lot you had before,

312
00:30:33,632 --> 00:30:35,299
they're cooling their
heels on another site.

313
00:30:35,301 --> 00:30:37,868
Won't bother us again.
Same with
the timber suppliers.

314
00:30:37,870 --> 00:30:41,638
One of your friends
at the interview
recommended them.

315
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:42,973
Perhaps he hadn't
thought it through.

316
00:30:42,975 --> 00:30:44,107
And you have?

317
00:30:44,109 --> 00:30:46,043
If you fail, we all fail.

318
00:30:47,145 --> 00:30:50,247
Not pretty, I'll grant,
but it's true.

319
00:30:52,483 --> 00:30:54,351
So...

320
00:30:54,353 --> 00:30:55,986
So, I learned
after some inquiries

321
00:30:55,988 --> 00:30:57,821
who had the commissions,
and everybody
had good laborers

322
00:30:57,823 --> 00:30:59,323
coming out their ears
except you.

323
00:30:59,325 --> 00:31:01,191
Thanks to your friends
at the interview.

324
00:31:01,193 --> 00:31:03,060
Some men take
losing harder than others.

325
00:31:03,062 --> 00:31:04,995
I, on the other hand,
have a leviathan for a wife

326
00:31:04,997 --> 00:31:07,331
and am very used to being
on the losing end.

327
00:31:07,333 --> 00:31:09,366
She issued very
precise instructions

328
00:31:09,368 --> 00:31:10,968
which, as I say,
I would never
dare go against.

329
00:31:10,970 --> 00:31:12,135
Instructions?

330
00:31:12,137 --> 00:31:14,404
"Ask her for work."

331
00:31:14,406 --> 00:31:17,686
Well, a man snaps
like a carrot exposed
to the leviathan.

332
00:31:19,043 --> 00:31:21,245
Besides, I have little ones.

333
00:31:22,313 --> 00:31:24,381
They make me proud,

334
00:31:24,383 --> 00:31:26,623
even if I am
humbled elsewhere.

335
00:31:27,051 --> 00:31:28,318
Can I take this off now?

336
00:31:35,994 --> 00:31:38,362
I've been issued
an invitation to the Louvre.

337
00:31:38,364 --> 00:31:40,030
Gracious me.

338
00:31:40,032 --> 00:31:42,032
Supper, too, I expect.
Very nice.

339
00:31:42,867 --> 00:31:44,434
Will there be others there?

340
00:32:34,986 --> 00:32:39,156
Versailles shall be
the heart of our kingdom,

341
00:32:39,158 --> 00:32:44,494
inhabited by
the finest examples
of humanity,

342
00:32:44,496 --> 00:32:48,432
fit for the gods
of old to behold

343
00:32:48,434 --> 00:32:50,767
and finding
their echo in gardens

344
00:32:50,769 --> 00:32:55,305
where each new turn
brings another excitement.

345
00:32:56,307 --> 00:32:59,443
Fountains whose gentle flow

346
00:32:59,445 --> 00:33:03,680
is balm enough
to ease a ringing ear.

347
00:33:03,682 --> 00:33:09,286
Scented groves
of orange blossom
blown by temperate winds.

348
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:26,536
What light,
what beauty, what hope.

349
00:33:27,872 --> 00:33:30,741
Versailles, Versailles,

350
00:33:31,943 --> 00:33:33,710
Versailles.

351
00:33:44,822 --> 00:33:46,089
Oh, pardon me.

352
00:33:58,636 --> 00:34:00,396
I believe this is
the way forward, <i> madame.</i>

353
00:34:05,643 --> 00:34:08,178
Some cool night air is,
I think,

354
00:34:08,180 --> 00:34:10,013
in order, <i> madame,</i>
do you not?

355
00:34:10,015 --> 00:34:11,248
Oh.

356
00:34:11,250 --> 00:34:12,816
Thank you.

357
00:34:14,420 --> 00:34:16,420
Your first time
at court, <i> madame?</i>

358
00:34:16,422 --> 00:34:18,488
Is... Is that where I am?

359
00:34:18,490 --> 00:34:20,650
Where did you imagine
yourself to be?

360
00:34:20,725 --> 00:34:22,926
Well, I don't know.

361
00:34:24,729 --> 00:34:28,098
A reception for
the gardeners of Versailles.

362
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:29,232
A sort of shed affair?

363
00:34:29,234 --> 00:34:30,767
How exquisite.

364
00:34:30,769 --> 00:34:32,469
A tiara amongst the weeds.

365
00:34:32,904 --> 00:34:34,738
I think I...

366
00:34:34,740 --> 00:34:37,574
I have
underestimated the event
on some level, <i> monsieur.</i>

367
00:34:37,576 --> 00:34:39,509
Antoine Nompar
de Caumont,

368
00:34:39,511 --> 00:34:42,012
Marquis de Puyguilhem,
Duc de Lauzun.

369
00:34:43,448 --> 00:34:44,614
Antoine.

370
00:34:46,384 --> 00:34:48,452
Sabine de Barra.
Charmed.

371
00:34:48,454 --> 00:34:50,654
Now, let me give you
the grand tour.

372
00:34:52,690 --> 00:34:55,592
What do you
know of us, <i> madame,</i>
we mice in a trap?

373
00:34:56,861 --> 00:35:00,097
Not a thing,
I'm sorry to say.

374
00:35:00,099 --> 00:35:02,899
Winter, summer,
autumn, spring,
we are here.

375
00:35:02,901 --> 00:35:05,302
We may not leave
without permission
of the king.

376
00:35:07,205 --> 00:35:09,139
Yes, mice in a trap.

377
00:35:09,141 --> 00:35:12,309
A small community,
there's only
about 2,000 of us.

378
00:35:12,311 --> 00:35:14,744
Everybody knows everybody else.

379
00:35:14,746 --> 00:35:18,215
Everybody has worked
their way through the group.

380
00:35:18,217 --> 00:35:19,916
"Worked their way through"?

381
00:35:19,918 --> 00:35:23,320
Fought with,
had an affair with,
that kind of thing.

382
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:31,995
Marquise de Montespan.
Late, as usual.

383
00:35:31,997 --> 00:35:34,331
She's the king's mistress.
Has at least four
of his children,

384
00:35:34,333 --> 00:35:35,932
but his attention has wandered.

385
00:35:35,934 --> 00:35:38,001
Now there is
a new star rising.

386
00:35:38,003 --> 00:35:40,070
Oh?
<i>Madame</i> de Maintenon.

387
00:35:41,305 --> 00:35:43,106
And she is here?
Devoted to God.

388
00:35:43,108 --> 00:35:45,175
Never attends anything
as frivolous as a party,

389
00:35:45,177 --> 00:35:46,576
unlike some people.

390
00:35:46,578 --> 00:35:48,245
Don't look.
They're talking about us.

391
00:35:49,013 --> 00:35:50,213
<i>Madame</i> de Barra.

392
00:35:52,116 --> 00:35:53,116
You are...

393
00:35:54,418 --> 00:35:55,719
Am I... Am I late?

394
00:35:56,354 --> 00:35:57,988
No.

395
00:35:57,990 --> 00:35:59,556
Early?
No.

396
00:36:00,124 --> 00:36:01,124
What, then?

397
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:04,027
Here.

398
00:36:04,029 --> 00:36:06,463
One of your gardeners?
Perfect.

399
00:36:06,465 --> 00:36:09,032
I must accompany
the marquise to supper.

400
00:36:09,034 --> 00:36:11,034
I could surrender
my new friend
into your care?

401
00:36:11,036 --> 00:36:12,502
Of course.

402
00:36:12,504 --> 00:36:13,803
Guard her well, <i> monsieur.</i>

403
00:36:13,805 --> 00:36:15,972
The vultures are circling.

404
00:36:15,974 --> 00:36:17,240
It has been my pleasure.

405
00:36:18,042 --> 00:36:19,176
<i>Madame?</i>

406
00:36:30,288 --> 00:36:32,355
It seems
an extraordinary life.

407
00:36:34,492 --> 00:36:36,159
But you may come and go?

408
00:36:36,161 --> 00:36:37,894
Oh, yes.

409
00:36:37,896 --> 00:36:40,330
I'm out and about.

410
00:36:40,332 --> 00:36:42,012
And now they're all
moving to Versailles.

411
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:44,201
To a village.

412
00:36:44,203 --> 00:36:46,336
Will you not join them?

413
00:36:46,338 --> 00:36:47,904
I would go slowly mad.

414
00:36:48,372 --> 00:36:50,340
Oh.

415
00:36:50,342 --> 00:36:53,582
Do they think of you
as a vegetable grower
or something?

416
00:36:53,911 --> 00:36:56,646
You show no consideration
for my vanity, <i> madame.</i>

417
00:36:56,648 --> 00:36:58,582
I'm quite sure
you possess none.

418
00:36:58,584 --> 00:37:01,718
What of you,
<i>Madame</i> Sabine de Barra?

419
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:03,820
Are you prone?

420
00:37:03,822 --> 00:37:05,022
You remember my hat?

421
00:37:06,524 --> 00:37:08,425
It would be
impossible to forget.

422
00:37:08,427 --> 00:37:10,227
It was
a considerable expense.

423
00:37:10,229 --> 00:37:11,728
And entirely unnecessary.

424
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:13,930
Nolly!

425
00:37:13,932 --> 00:37:15,665
My dear old cabbage!

426
00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:17,534
<i>Monsieur.</i>

427
00:37:17,536 --> 00:37:20,870
Give me a kiss instantly
or I shall take
grave offense.

428
00:37:20,872 --> 00:37:22,939
What a splendid hat.
Do you think so?

429
00:37:22,941 --> 00:37:25,075
I'm trying it out,
I never wear a hat.

430
00:37:25,077 --> 00:37:26,810
No.
Fear of squashing my wig.

431
00:37:27,411 --> 00:37:28,778
But who's this?

432
00:37:28,780 --> 00:37:30,680
Dear lady,
you are prostrate.
Allow me.

433
00:37:31,048 --> 00:37:32,882
May I present

434
00:37:32,884 --> 00:37:35,885
His Royal Highness Philippe,
Duke of Orleans?

435
00:37:35,887 --> 00:37:38,588
Your Highness,
this is <i> Madame</i>
Sabine de Barra.

436
00:37:38,590 --> 00:37:39,956
Delighted, <i> madame.</i>

437
00:37:39,958 --> 00:37:43,126
How is it that
a woman of such
exquisite taste

438
00:37:43,128 --> 00:37:45,929
falls in with a clay
kicker like Andre here?

439
00:37:45,931 --> 00:37:49,699
I must confess to being
a clay kicker myself,
Your Highness.

440
00:37:49,701 --> 00:37:51,868
I am working for
the master at Versailles.

441
00:37:51,870 --> 00:37:53,270
I am unable to picture it.

442
00:37:53,272 --> 00:37:54,672
Do tell us
how it is that you are.

443
00:37:55,641 --> 00:37:57,741
Oh. May I present
Marquis du Vasse?

444
00:37:57,743 --> 00:37:59,976
Master Le Notre,
<i>Madame</i> de Barra.
Delighted.

445
00:37:59,978 --> 00:38:01,778
But the mystery
remains, <i> madame.</i>

446
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:04,414
What is a woman of such
restrained sophistication

447
00:38:04,416 --> 00:38:05,749
doing with Nolly here?

448
00:38:05,751 --> 00:38:07,984
I speak
from the opposite end
of the fashion scale.

449
00:38:07,986 --> 00:38:10,387
I don't apologize for it,
I like it about myself.

450
00:38:10,389 --> 00:38:12,222
Answer, <i> madame.</i>
Stop me talking.

451
00:38:13,991 --> 00:38:17,127
It was the only thing
I knew how to do,
for money.

452
00:38:17,129 --> 00:38:19,896
And you enjoy
your profession?
It stimulates you?

453
00:38:19,898 --> 00:38:21,598
It has seen me
through some very hard times

454
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:23,300
and allowed me
to be independent.

455
00:38:23,302 --> 00:38:24,467
Dearest!

456
00:38:25,269 --> 00:38:27,304
I simply do as I am told.

457
00:38:27,306 --> 00:38:30,173
Even down to marrying
large German women.

458
00:38:30,175 --> 00:38:32,275
Though, I confess,
I like her better
than my last wife,

459
00:38:32,277 --> 00:38:34,844
who is dead as
a doornail now,
thank God.

460
00:38:34,846 --> 00:38:38,014
Do kiss me, husband.
I am in need of affection.

461
00:38:40,151 --> 00:38:43,753
It is wonderful to have
access to one's spouse.

462
00:38:43,755 --> 00:38:45,088
My dear,
we're being very rude.

463
00:38:45,090 --> 00:38:47,123
Princess Palatine,
Duchess of Orleans,

464
00:38:47,125 --> 00:38:48,925
may I present
<i>Madame</i> de Barra, who...

465
00:38:48,927 --> 00:38:51,861
Nolly, what is
<i>Madame</i> de Barra
engaged to do?

466
00:38:51,863 --> 00:38:53,997
Hold for this, my dear,
it will interest you.

467
00:38:53,999 --> 00:38:56,866
She is to build
a water cascade
at Versailles.

468
00:38:56,868 --> 00:38:59,002
Nothing like it will
exist in the gardens.

469
00:38:59,004 --> 00:39:00,670
How fascinating.

470
00:39:00,672 --> 00:39:02,839
I am a great admirer
of engineering.

471
00:39:02,841 --> 00:39:04,507
<i>Madame,</i> you must promise
to show us.

472
00:39:04,509 --> 00:39:06,643
Perhaps Your Highnesses

473
00:39:06,645 --> 00:39:08,712
would care to take lunch
at the Louveciennes aqueduct?

474
00:39:08,714 --> 00:39:10,847
Is it in the country?

475
00:39:10,849 --> 00:39:13,350
I always disappear
in the country.

476
00:39:13,352 --> 00:39:15,685
But now that we are to move
out to Versailles,

477
00:39:15,687 --> 00:39:18,355
I shall become
a human jellyfish.

478
00:39:18,357 --> 00:39:19,989
A miserable, formless being.

479
00:39:19,991 --> 00:39:22,191
We should love to come,
Master Le Notre.

480
00:39:25,029 --> 00:39:26,930
Everybody should
really attend, I imagine.

481
00:39:27,398 --> 00:39:29,032
Come, <i> Madame</i> de Barra.

482
00:39:29,034 --> 00:39:31,668
Take a turnabout with me
and tell me of your scheme.

483
00:39:31,670 --> 00:39:32,969
With pleasure, Your Highness.

484
00:39:36,207 --> 00:39:39,976
Well, Nolly,
<i>Madame</i> de Barra has certainly
thrilled my dearest.

485
00:39:39,978 --> 00:39:43,847
Has she thrilled you also?

486
00:39:43,849 --> 00:39:47,016
She's very diverting
and extremely clever
at what she does, I think.

487
00:39:47,018 --> 00:39:48,318
Do you indeed?

488
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:50,086
I am glad.

489
00:39:50,088 --> 00:39:51,588
Good man.

490
00:40:01,065 --> 00:40:02,132
Macaroon?

491
00:40:03,167 --> 00:40:04,234
Thank you, sire.

492
00:40:08,873 --> 00:40:10,840
My speech went
down well, I thought.

493
00:40:10,842 --> 00:40:12,776
It did.

494
00:40:12,778 --> 00:40:15,978
"The finest
examples of humanity"
certainly enjoyed it.

495
00:40:19,417 --> 00:40:21,885
We may be building with stone,
but I can tell
you it's a feather

496
00:40:21,887 --> 00:40:23,853
compared to the weight
of the state.

497
00:40:26,757 --> 00:40:28,725
My brother tells me
you're inviting

498
00:40:28,727 --> 00:40:31,194
new ideas
into the gardens. Why?

499
00:40:31,196 --> 00:40:33,563
I've been persuaded
to expand my horizons.

500
00:40:33,565 --> 00:40:35,231
Have they been tested?

501
00:40:35,233 --> 00:40:37,153
They are, in my opinion,
appropriate.

502
00:40:38,402 --> 00:40:39,702
Appropriate?

503
00:40:43,541 --> 00:40:46,743
Last year, we had the Nymphs
and Shepherds costume party,

504
00:40:46,745 --> 00:40:49,879
and it was not a bit funny,
all those haggard
faces under flaxen wigs.

505
00:40:49,881 --> 00:40:51,314
We looked ancient.

506
00:40:51,316 --> 00:40:53,116
I want a window
to perfection

507
00:40:53,118 --> 00:40:56,719
so that people can see
the very best of themselves.

508
00:40:56,721 --> 00:40:58,955
We've grown too old
for jokes.

509
00:41:00,624 --> 00:41:02,959
The work will be
original but balanced.

510
00:41:03,961 --> 00:41:06,242
The responsibility
will be mine.

511
00:41:06,964 --> 00:41:08,031
Yes.

512
00:41:10,301 --> 00:41:11,367
It will.

513
00:41:18,609 --> 00:41:19,609
<i>Andre.</i>

514
00:41:20,611 --> 00:41:23,011
I did not see you
there in the gloom.

515
00:41:28,853 --> 00:41:30,987
Did you enjoy your evening?

516
00:41:30,989 --> 00:41:33,723
As much, I imagine,
as you did yours.

517
00:41:41,832 --> 00:41:43,333
You were with that woman.

518
00:43:15,426 --> 00:43:16,759
Clear!

519
00:43:42,820 --> 00:43:44,320
You are reckless, <i> madame.</i>

520
00:44:01,905 --> 00:44:05,575
Do you know that my husband
and the marquis are lovers?

521
00:44:05,577 --> 00:44:09,545
It has not stopped
us having children,
and he loved them dearly.

522
00:44:10,914 --> 00:44:12,874
In battle,
he's immensely brave.

523
00:44:13,651 --> 00:44:15,184
And he has a good heart.

524
00:44:16,253 --> 00:44:17,820
I am happy with my choice.

525
00:44:37,274 --> 00:44:38,714
<i>Another thing about the country</i>

526
00:44:40,044 --> 00:44:41,210
is the muck.

527
00:44:42,946 --> 00:44:44,947
One encounters it everywhere.

528
00:44:45,716 --> 00:44:47,550
Or beasts making muck.

529
00:44:49,653 --> 00:44:51,754
The country is full of muck.

530
00:44:57,795 --> 00:45:01,075
I sometimes feel
entirely defeated
by life's extremities.

531
00:45:02,299 --> 00:45:04,539
When I come to
a place like this,

532
00:45:05,202 --> 00:45:08,571
gradually, a small
courage takes hold of me

533
00:45:08,573 --> 00:45:10,106
and I feel fitter for things.

534
00:45:11,075 --> 00:45:12,595
Do you feel
that way often?

535
00:45:13,410 --> 00:45:15,478
More so with time.

536
00:45:20,851 --> 00:45:22,585
Your wife does not
accompany you ever?

537
00:45:23,987 --> 00:45:27,190
That is, she does not
come out with you,

538
00:45:27,192 --> 00:45:29,992
other times, besides now?

539
00:45:32,763 --> 00:45:34,564
You're very direct, <i> madame.</i>

540
00:45:42,106 --> 00:45:43,473
We have an arrangement.

541
00:45:45,576 --> 00:45:47,736
I feel disloyal in
discussing such matters.

542
00:45:50,247 --> 00:45:51,948
You are also married?

543
00:45:54,551 --> 00:45:55,618
No.

544
00:45:57,721 --> 00:45:59,188
My husband died.

545
00:45:59,957 --> 00:46:01,197
I'm sorry.

546
00:46:03,961 --> 00:46:06,462
Today you said
I was reckless,

547
00:46:06,464 --> 00:46:09,565
but to be reckless
is to abandon safety,

548
00:46:09,567 --> 00:46:14,470
but I think
maybe it is safety
that has abandoned me.

549
00:46:30,654 --> 00:46:32,054
What is it?

550
00:46:35,425 --> 00:46:36,425
Nothing.

551
00:46:37,461 --> 00:46:38,461
It...

552
00:46:40,931 --> 00:46:42,365
I would like to walk on.

553
00:46:42,900 --> 00:46:44,200
Of course.

554
00:46:46,837 --> 00:46:48,337
Come.

555
00:46:48,339 --> 00:46:50,659
There's something
you should see.

556
00:47:04,655 --> 00:47:06,222
It's a shrine.

557
00:48:05,916 --> 00:48:08,751
The queen is dead.

558
00:48:42,586 --> 00:48:43,920
So kind.

559
00:48:43,922 --> 00:48:45,321
So quick.

560
00:49:06,910 --> 00:49:08,790
Did you have fun
on your picnic, Andre?

561
00:49:12,215 --> 00:49:14,650
I take it, <i> madame,</i>
you are unaware of events?

562
00:49:14,652 --> 00:49:15,985
Events?

563
00:49:16,787 --> 00:49:18,154
What do you mean, events?

564
00:49:18,156 --> 00:49:21,090
The queen is dead, <i> madame.</i>

565
00:49:21,092 --> 00:49:22,858
The queen?
Is dead.

566
00:49:28,165 --> 00:49:29,765
The king could marry again?

567
00:49:29,767 --> 00:49:32,201
But no longer
to your friend,
the marquise, I think.

568
00:49:33,070 --> 00:49:34,704
I feel sorry for Montespan.

569
00:49:37,941 --> 00:49:39,075
Tread carefully, <i> madame.</i>

570
00:49:52,923 --> 00:49:54,490
More on the wagon!

571
00:49:54,492 --> 00:49:55,992
No, the other one.

572
00:49:57,327 --> 00:49:58,761
I want the seasoned wood.

573
00:49:58,763 --> 00:50:00,162
Seasoned.

574
00:50:09,039 --> 00:50:10,606
Here, pass it here.

575
00:50:20,317 --> 00:50:21,550
<i>Madame</i> de Barra.

576
00:50:27,290 --> 00:50:28,391
Master.

577
00:50:29,226 --> 00:50:30,659
You've made
some progress here.

578
00:50:30,661 --> 00:50:32,628
I have a new foreman.

579
00:50:32,630 --> 00:50:33,863
<i>Monsieur</i> Duras.

580
00:50:41,571 --> 00:50:44,240
We've had to drain the soil
below the fountain.

581
00:50:44,242 --> 00:50:46,542
The ground is waterlogged.

582
00:50:46,544 --> 00:50:48,704
It's a problem
common to the gardens.

583
00:51:18,608 --> 00:51:19,842
Thank you.

584
00:51:25,782 --> 00:51:27,917
Do you sometimes
forget to eat?

585
00:51:32,189 --> 00:51:34,790
This is pâté from
<i>Madame</i> de la Tour.

586
00:51:34,792 --> 00:51:36,632
She feeds the ducks
on seaweed.

587
00:51:39,396 --> 00:51:40,830
It was all she could afford.

588
00:51:41,565 --> 00:51:43,365
Virtue from necessity.

589
00:51:49,940 --> 00:51:51,474
What amuses you?

590
00:51:53,310 --> 00:51:54,410
There was an Irish woman
who died,

591
00:51:54,412 --> 00:51:57,379
and her husband
put on her tombstone,

592
00:51:57,381 --> 00:51:59,782
"Here lies Eleanor Fitzgerald.

593
00:51:59,784 --> 00:52:01,664
"Her virtues
exceeded her failings."

594
00:52:02,819 --> 00:52:04,887
How noble of him.

595
00:52:04,889 --> 00:52:06,689
You think
he showed her that
before she died?

596
00:52:07,591 --> 00:52:09,591
I'd have stuck
an arrow in his eye.

597
00:52:10,627 --> 00:52:12,361
Perhaps he was being truthful.

598
00:52:18,735 --> 00:52:19,969
How is the king?

599
00:52:22,472 --> 00:52:23,639
Shocked, I believe.

600
00:52:25,008 --> 00:52:27,743
Poor little Spanish woman.

601
00:52:27,745 --> 00:52:30,613
Has her head chopped off
and her organs
laid out neatly.

602
00:52:30,615 --> 00:52:32,848
And all her friends,
her maids, everyone,

603
00:52:32,850 --> 00:52:34,517
must gather around the table.

604
00:52:37,354 --> 00:52:39,155
Why would they
chop her head off?

605
00:52:39,157 --> 00:52:40,856
To see what she died of.

606
00:52:43,693 --> 00:52:46,613
You must
attend the funeral,
I suppose?

607
00:52:51,835 --> 00:52:53,602
Well, I should go.

608
00:53:25,669 --> 00:53:27,203
It is I, King <i> Monsieur.</i>

609
00:53:27,671 --> 00:53:28,737
May I?

610
00:53:30,807 --> 00:53:32,007
Come, then, brother.

611
00:53:33,677 --> 00:53:36,745
If the king does not eat,
France does not eat.

612
00:53:36,747 --> 00:53:38,847
I shall feed France,

613
00:53:38,849 --> 00:53:40,549
and you must put up with it.

614
00:53:40,551 --> 00:53:41,917
I'm not hungry.

615
00:53:42,919 --> 00:53:43,986
I have rose jellies.

616
00:53:50,427 --> 00:53:51,794
Have you lemon?

617
00:54:06,176 --> 00:54:07,977
I wish to go to Marly.

618
00:54:09,412 --> 00:54:11,647
And I wish to be alone.

619
00:54:43,947 --> 00:54:45,648
Try not to bend the tops.

620
00:56:56,746 --> 00:56:58,313
My beauties.

621
00:59:02,405 --> 00:59:03,645
<i>Monsieur</i> de la Quintinie?

622
00:59:09,846 --> 00:59:11,046
<i>Madame</i> Sabine de Barra.

623
00:59:12,415 --> 00:59:14,416
I'm very happy to meet you.

624
00:59:14,418 --> 00:59:17,653
I am directed by the Office
of Buildings of Versailles

625
00:59:17,655 --> 00:59:21,015
to order shrubs,
such as I require,
from your good self.

626
00:59:22,659 --> 00:59:24,860
I have brought with me
a selection of perennials

627
00:59:24,862 --> 00:59:26,062
I thought we might exchange.

628
00:59:33,570 --> 00:59:34,937
Is this the Four Seasons?

629
00:59:39,542 --> 00:59:40,943
Yes, I believe so.

630
00:59:43,012 --> 00:59:44,246
Mmm.

631
00:59:44,248 --> 00:59:45,248
Divine.

632
00:59:46,849 --> 00:59:48,350
Good color, too.

633
00:59:48,352 --> 00:59:50,786
You say you have
a selection of plants?

634
00:59:50,788 --> 00:59:52,621
I had them unloaded
into a little cart,

635
00:59:52,623 --> 00:59:54,923
intending to have
them conveyed here,

636
00:59:54,925 --> 00:59:57,025
but there seems to be
no one about.

637
00:59:57,027 --> 00:59:59,427
I wished to be alone,
I had them sent away.

638
00:59:59,862 --> 01:00:01,763
If you wish to be alone,
I could come back.

639
01:00:01,765 --> 01:00:03,465
No, no, no.

640
01:00:03,467 --> 01:00:06,867
I find you are
the very company
I need today.

641
01:00:08,237 --> 01:00:11,873
Nothing would suit
me better than for me,

642
01:00:14,644 --> 01:00:16,211
the king's gardener,

643
01:00:17,780 --> 01:00:20,061
to take some advice
on perennials.

644
01:00:24,220 --> 01:00:26,540
Allow me, <i> madame,</i> to assist you.

645
01:00:26,723 --> 01:00:27,789
Hmm.

646
01:00:28,825 --> 01:00:30,125
Most kind, <i> monsieur.</i>

647
01:00:33,663 --> 01:00:36,164
You are a devoted
pear man, master.

648
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:39,120
I quite like them,
not overly.

649
01:00:39,769 --> 01:00:41,136
Oh...

650
01:00:41,138 --> 01:00:43,972
I think the master is
playing a trick on me.

651
01:00:45,274 --> 01:00:46,508
A trick?

652
01:00:46,510 --> 01:00:48,810
Well, yes, I do know
of your book on pears.

653
01:00:50,246 --> 01:00:51,713
My book on pears?

654
01:00:55,084 --> 01:00:57,686
Oh, yes, I have written
a book on pears.

655
01:01:00,123 --> 01:01:02,024
I believe I said
I liked them a lot
in my book.

656
01:01:02,959 --> 01:01:04,059
I believe you did.

657
01:01:05,595 --> 01:01:07,195
And perennials.

658
01:01:09,832 --> 01:01:11,533
You like flowers, master?

659
01:01:11,535 --> 01:01:14,302
<i>Madame</i> de Barra,
I love all flowers
passionately.

660
01:01:14,304 --> 01:01:16,672
However, I am banished
from using as many
as I would like

661
01:01:16,674 --> 01:01:18,674
at Versailles by
the Master Le Notre.

662
01:01:18,676 --> 01:01:21,777
He indulges me in
a few small parterres.

663
01:01:21,779 --> 01:01:23,945
I'd hoped to be able
to convert him
when we took up residence.

664
01:01:23,947 --> 01:01:25,547
However...

665
01:01:28,785 --> 01:01:29,851
Oh!

666
01:01:31,988 --> 01:01:34,189
You're wise to me now, <i> madame.</i>

667
01:01:38,561 --> 01:01:41,296
May we ignore all that
and continue as before?

668
01:01:44,033 --> 01:01:46,101
Today, I am

669
01:01:47,970 --> 01:01:50,205
<i>Monsieur</i> de la Quintinie.

670
01:01:50,207 --> 01:01:51,239
Indeed.

671
01:01:52,575 --> 01:01:53,909
And you are.

672
01:01:59,148 --> 01:02:01,349
You are
the better for the move
to Versailles, sire?

673
01:02:01,351 --> 01:02:03,185
Very much.

674
01:02:03,187 --> 01:02:05,020
It's good for the children
to be away from the city.

675
01:02:05,022 --> 01:02:07,856
I know it's a crush
for everybody.

676
01:02:07,858 --> 01:02:10,258
I felt, though,
that I should never
get the builders out

677
01:02:10,260 --> 01:02:12,661
unless I moved in.

678
01:02:12,663 --> 01:02:15,997
You are familiar
with builders,
<i>Madame</i> de Barra?

679
01:02:15,999 --> 01:02:20,335
At present, I am
building in your gardens
at Versailles.

680
01:02:20,337 --> 01:02:22,417
Which construction
would that be?

681
01:02:22,672 --> 01:02:24,172
The Rockwork Grove.

682
01:02:25,708 --> 01:02:27,242
I am familiar with it.

683
01:02:27,244 --> 01:02:30,212
I cannot claim it
entirely as my own.

684
01:02:30,214 --> 01:02:33,048
Master Le Notre took
a simple sketch of mine

685
01:02:33,050 --> 01:02:36,451
and made it outstanding, so...

686
01:02:37,787 --> 01:02:40,422
You see my reluctance.

687
01:02:40,424 --> 01:02:42,257
You admire the master,
<i>madame?</i>

688
01:02:45,728 --> 01:02:48,663
He is the most
complete person I know.

689
01:02:51,567 --> 01:02:54,669
You make me lonely
for someone to
describe me thus.

690
01:03:00,977 --> 01:03:02,344
These are your flowers?

691
01:03:39,649 --> 01:03:42,017
My wife died recently.

692
01:03:42,019 --> 01:03:43,385
Did you hear?

693
01:03:44,453 --> 01:03:45,653
I did, sire.

694
01:03:48,024 --> 01:03:50,859
I remember the day
of your marriage.

695
01:03:50,861 --> 01:03:52,394
I hope so,
it cost enough.

696
01:03:54,297 --> 01:03:56,932
Though her father paid
for a large portion.

697
01:03:59,468 --> 01:04:02,003
Astray in his wits,
bless him.

698
01:04:02,005 --> 01:04:03,839
A long bloodline,
never a good thing.

699
01:04:06,776 --> 01:04:09,377
She was an innocent, really.

700
01:04:12,515 --> 01:04:14,015
But she was nice.

701
01:04:16,185 --> 01:04:18,420
And devoted to me.

702
01:04:21,991 --> 01:04:24,025
I found this after she died.

703
01:04:26,896 --> 01:04:30,665
It's just an account
of our lives.

704
01:04:30,667 --> 01:04:33,134
The writing's like a child's.

705
01:04:33,136 --> 01:04:34,536
You see here?

706
01:04:36,072 --> 01:04:39,140
"Today I saved a flower
from His Majesty."

707
01:04:39,142 --> 01:04:40,775
And then the time
and the place.

708
01:04:45,348 --> 01:04:47,816
This little woman's
secret life.

709
01:04:51,020 --> 01:04:53,255
I feel the loss of it.

710
01:04:58,227 --> 01:05:00,067
I should like to
marry again.

711
01:05:02,098 --> 01:05:04,633
This time someone I choose,

712
01:05:05,401 --> 01:05:06,501
not the state.

713
01:05:07,536 --> 01:05:09,371
Has Your Majesty
someone in mind?

714
01:05:09,373 --> 01:05:11,406
I have,
but the lady's very pious.

715
01:05:13,342 --> 01:05:17,913
Most evenings
I stroll over to her rooms,
and we just sit and talk.

716
01:05:20,182 --> 01:05:22,584
But it is
the ease of it I like.

717
01:05:24,854 --> 01:05:26,421
The ease.

718
01:05:30,426 --> 01:05:32,727
Unfortunately,
she is of no birth,

719
01:05:32,729 --> 01:05:35,297
so, you see,
I am at a little impasse.

720
01:05:38,234 --> 01:05:41,369
If you were to be
married to

721
01:05:41,938 --> 01:05:43,872
the lady of your choosing,

722
01:05:45,608 --> 01:05:48,944
would it be necessary
for everyone to know?

723
01:05:48,946 --> 01:05:52,847
If the ceremony
were private,
between the couple,

724
01:05:55,651 --> 01:05:57,752
who would be in a position
to argue the outcome?

725
01:05:57,754 --> 01:06:01,154
They would be foolish
to do so afterwards,
when it was done.

726
01:06:01,657 --> 01:06:02,724
Mmm.

727
01:06:05,428 --> 01:06:06,494
Yes.

728
01:06:10,600 --> 01:06:12,701
So much to contend.

729
01:06:18,975 --> 01:06:20,975
And what of you,
<i>Madame</i> de Barra?

730
01:06:22,912 --> 01:06:26,081
What pulse drives you?

731
01:06:26,083 --> 01:06:27,549
There is someone you love?

732
01:06:29,919 --> 01:06:31,219
I cannot say.

733
01:06:32,421 --> 01:06:33,521
Why?

734
01:06:37,293 --> 01:06:40,295
Because...
Because of something private.

735
01:06:40,297 --> 01:06:43,298
What is so private that it
cannot be shared in love?

736
01:06:43,300 --> 01:06:44,666
The time has come, <i> madame,</i>

737
01:06:46,202 --> 01:06:49,104
for us both
to face down our past

738
01:06:49,106 --> 01:06:51,239
and live in the present.

739
01:06:55,644 --> 01:06:58,847
I shall write a letter
from one gardener to another,

740
01:06:58,849 --> 01:07:02,951
shall we say,
in return for seeds sown.

741
01:07:02,953 --> 01:07:04,753
It will bring you
to the court,

742
01:07:07,490 --> 01:07:09,224
where my eye

743
01:07:10,960 --> 01:07:12,794
will always be on you.

744
01:07:16,165 --> 01:07:19,100
I shall not forget
our day in the garden,
<i>Madame</i> de Barra.

745
01:07:34,250 --> 01:07:37,719
Are you still fiddling
with your bits, Andre?

746
01:07:37,721 --> 01:07:38,920
It helps me think.

747
01:07:38,922 --> 01:07:40,588
For you.

748
01:07:41,223 --> 01:07:42,657
It has the fleur-de-lis.

749
01:07:46,395 --> 01:07:48,355
Is it from the king,
I wonder?

750
01:07:54,870 --> 01:07:55,937
Is it an invitation?

751
01:07:58,274 --> 01:07:59,741
There is something
you need, <i> madame?</i>

752
01:07:59,743 --> 01:08:02,444
Andre? So secret?

753
01:08:02,446 --> 01:08:05,346
I must inform you,
since you ask,

754
01:08:05,348 --> 01:08:07,449
that I leave
for Fontainebleau
at the end of the week.

755
01:08:07,451 --> 01:08:09,517
Fontainebleau?

756
01:08:09,519 --> 01:08:12,554
I was not aware
there were activities.

757
01:08:12,556 --> 01:08:14,255
The marquise
must have forgotten.

758
01:08:14,257 --> 01:08:16,591
I will travel there alone.

759
01:08:16,593 --> 01:08:18,927
Plainly, <i> madame,</i>
that is the position.

760
01:08:18,929 --> 01:08:20,261
If you will excuse me.

761
01:08:22,465 --> 01:08:24,732
<i>Madame</i> de Barra.

762
01:08:24,734 --> 01:08:27,435
Is she an aspect
of your life
I must now include?

763
01:08:27,437 --> 01:08:30,205
Andre, a builder?

764
01:08:30,207 --> 01:08:31,806
I'm a builder, <i> madame.</i>

765
01:08:31,808 --> 01:08:34,042
You are funded
by that profession.

766
01:08:34,044 --> 01:08:36,544
Very amusing.

767
01:08:36,546 --> 01:08:38,713
Perhaps that is the fantasy
between you and she.

768
01:08:38,715 --> 01:08:40,281
So be it.

769
01:08:40,283 --> 01:08:41,449
However, I must request that

770
01:08:41,451 --> 01:08:44,152
you keep it
separate from our lives.

771
01:08:44,154 --> 01:08:45,620
If this liaison
became common knowledge,

772
01:08:45,622 --> 01:08:46,754
it would make me
a laughingstock.

773
01:08:46,756 --> 01:08:48,289
It makes my flesh crawl.

774
01:08:48,291 --> 01:08:51,891
I remind you, <i> madame,</i>
that it was you who
embarked on this path.

775
01:08:52,962 --> 01:08:56,498
You and only you
dictated how we live now,

776
01:08:56,500 --> 01:08:57,732
and you did it, <i> madame,</i>

777
01:08:58,501 --> 01:08:59,734
when I needed you most.

778
01:08:59,736 --> 01:09:01,002
Andre.

779
01:09:04,473 --> 01:09:06,374
I feel us at the edge
of something here.

780
01:09:07,843 --> 01:09:09,310
I'm trying to pull us back.

781
01:09:09,312 --> 01:09:11,679
You knew the damage
you inflicted,

782
01:09:11,681 --> 01:09:14,182
but you have been free
to live your life
as you wished

783
01:09:14,184 --> 01:09:16,484
without embarrassment from me.

784
01:09:16,486 --> 01:09:19,766
I ask you now
to extend me
the same courtesy.

785
01:09:21,490 --> 01:09:23,992
Andre, you must make
the sensible choice here.

786
01:09:23,994 --> 01:09:25,593
Do not exclude me,
I beg you.

787
01:09:29,298 --> 01:09:30,565
I begged you once.

788
01:09:31,500 --> 01:09:33,368
Do you remember?

789
01:09:33,370 --> 01:09:35,870
Allow me to give you
the same advice
you gave me then.

790
01:09:35,872 --> 01:09:39,032
You said,
"It is a matter
of feeling special.

791
01:09:39,975 --> 01:09:43,055
"If we are unable,
one, to make
the other feel special,

792
01:09:43,779 --> 01:09:45,880
"we must just accept it,

793
01:09:45,882 --> 01:09:47,348
"seek comfort elsewhere

794
01:09:47,350 --> 01:09:49,050
"with others.

795
01:09:50,319 --> 01:09:52,079
"It is an honest contract,
my dear.

796
01:09:53,022 --> 01:09:54,622
"You'll grow used to it."

797
01:09:55,791 --> 01:09:57,959
That is what you said.

798
01:10:25,688 --> 01:10:27,555
What's the root ball like?

799
01:10:28,857 --> 01:10:30,858
It's a bit dry.

800
01:10:30,860 --> 01:10:32,060
Soak them overnight.

801
01:10:32,494 --> 01:10:33,995
You may not need to.

802
01:10:33,997 --> 01:10:35,330
Just secure them, then.

803
01:10:36,532 --> 01:10:37,732
We should cover these tiers.

804
01:10:47,710 --> 01:10:48,910
I need more rope.

805
01:10:48,912 --> 01:10:49,978
I need more food.

806
01:10:50,579 --> 01:10:52,347
In the warm.

807
01:10:52,349 --> 01:10:53,681
You go on, I'll follow.

808
01:11:06,195 --> 01:11:07,495
<i>Madame</i> de Barra.

809
01:11:13,369 --> 01:11:14,802
My name is Le Notre.

810
01:11:21,043 --> 01:11:22,110
<i>Madame.</i>

811
01:11:24,380 --> 01:11:25,880
Did you ever see someone

812
01:11:25,882 --> 01:11:28,322
and know that they were to
play a role in your life?

813
01:11:29,285 --> 01:11:30,685
You're a widow, I believe.

814
01:11:31,553 --> 01:11:33,321
How lonely that must be.

815
01:11:36,592 --> 01:11:40,995
I've known for some time
that Andre had
some secret happiness,

816
01:11:40,997 --> 01:11:44,532
but my husband's ambitions
are married only to mine.

817
01:11:45,634 --> 01:11:47,135
You're not
the first diversion,

818
01:11:47,137 --> 01:11:49,270
and I believe at the moment,

819
01:11:49,272 --> 01:11:50,472
not the only one.

820
01:11:51,640 --> 01:11:53,921
You will come
and you will go.

821
01:11:55,311 --> 01:11:57,512
Understand me, <i> madame.</i>

822
01:11:58,580 --> 01:12:00,715
It suits my
husband and I this way.

823
01:12:16,465 --> 01:12:17,732
Pretty thing.

824
01:12:45,828 --> 01:12:50,198
<i>We found</i>
<i>the sluice gate that connects</i>
<i>the reservoir to the fountain.</i>

825
01:12:50,200 --> 01:12:52,967
<i>If we fill it,</i>
<i>the pressure in</i>
<i>the pipes will build,</i>

826
01:12:52,969 --> 01:12:54,402
<i>and we can flood the grove.</i>

827
01:12:57,639 --> 01:12:58,940
Do it.

828
01:13:04,380 --> 01:13:05,747
Later.

829
01:14:42,411 --> 01:14:43,878
Use the wood
to hold it down!

830
01:14:46,615 --> 01:14:48,416
The sluice gate
must be open!

831
01:14:48,418 --> 01:14:49,851
We need more hands!

832
01:14:49,853 --> 01:14:51,018
Then pray.

833
01:14:52,354 --> 01:14:53,754
To hell with that.

834
01:16:56,445 --> 01:16:57,445
Thank you.

835
01:17:09,324 --> 01:17:10,324
Will it mend?

836
01:17:11,293 --> 01:17:12,493
It will mend.

837
01:17:14,596 --> 01:17:16,464
The tiers were too weak.

838
01:17:16,466 --> 01:17:18,165
The gate was left open.

839
01:17:18,167 --> 01:17:20,527
You cannot be blamed
for that, or the storm.

840
01:17:24,239 --> 01:17:25,740
What should I do?

841
01:17:25,742 --> 01:17:27,041
Adapt.

842
01:17:29,678 --> 01:17:31,712
Like a well-trained plant?

843
01:17:32,848 --> 01:17:34,415
Like a well-trained plant.

844
01:17:41,490 --> 01:17:44,058
Am I part
of an amusement for you?

845
01:17:45,494 --> 01:17:46,594
Not at all.

846
01:17:47,796 --> 01:17:49,497
I'm unused to all this.

847
01:17:53,435 --> 01:17:54,435
Is it honest?

848
01:17:56,705 --> 01:17:58,706
Are you?
No.

849
01:18:00,876 --> 01:18:04,116
I have not been honest
since I watched you
in my garden.

850
01:18:05,280 --> 01:18:07,360
Your heart beats fiercely.
Mine just ticks.

851
01:18:10,819 --> 01:18:13,019
I have not gifts
to offer such a wonder.

852
01:18:15,390 --> 01:18:17,591
If you are hungry,
I'll feed you.

853
01:18:19,494 --> 01:18:21,128
If I am mad,
you will tell me.

854
01:18:22,164 --> 01:18:23,324
You are not mad.

855
01:18:24,833 --> 01:18:26,434
You don't know all of me yet.

856
01:18:32,374 --> 01:18:33,474
Are you hungry?

857
01:18:35,477 --> 01:18:36,577
Starving.

858
01:18:55,198 --> 01:18:56,664
Are you not happy?

859
01:18:58,200 --> 01:18:59,333
Yes.

860
01:19:01,837 --> 01:19:03,677
That's what is making me cry.

861
01:19:18,420 --> 01:19:19,920
I can't.

862
01:19:25,627 --> 01:19:26,961
I can't.

863
01:19:26,963 --> 01:19:28,295
Don't ask me.

864
01:20:23,919 --> 01:20:26,687
- What am I to say?
- "It is original"?

865
01:20:26,689 --> 01:20:28,856
"Continue indefinitely"?

866
01:20:28,858 --> 01:20:30,324
Do you expect that of us?

867
01:20:32,994 --> 01:20:35,095
You've been working
with <i> Madame</i> de Barra.

868
01:20:36,198 --> 01:20:38,933
Are you committed
to this design?

869
01:20:38,935 --> 01:20:40,768
If I may say,
Your Majesty,

870
01:20:40,770 --> 01:20:42,937
I was just
as skeptical as you are
in the beginning, like.

871
01:20:42,939 --> 01:20:44,371
But now?

872
01:20:44,373 --> 01:20:46,173
I'm a convert,
so to speak,
Your Majesty.

873
01:20:46,175 --> 01:20:48,676
Even now, the setbacks
were due to nature, sire.

874
01:20:48,678 --> 01:20:50,277
Perfection does
not bow to nature.

875
01:20:50,279 --> 01:20:52,646
What on earth
are those things?

876
01:20:52,648 --> 01:20:55,282
Well, sire,
I'm glad you asked me that,
because that, really,

877
01:20:55,284 --> 01:20:56,817
is what <i> Madame</i> de Barra is.

878
01:20:56,819 --> 01:20:58,018
Odd, sire.

879
01:20:58,020 --> 01:20:59,253
May I show Your Majesty?

880
01:21:10,131 --> 01:21:13,400
You will recall what I said
about Nymphs and Shepherds.

881
01:21:13,402 --> 01:21:16,403
As we age,
we see things more clearly.

882
01:21:17,839 --> 01:21:19,273
This project,

883
01:21:21,810 --> 01:21:23,611
is it worthy of us?

884
01:21:29,317 --> 01:21:31,397
There's no precedent
for <i> Madame</i> de Barra's vision.

885
01:21:33,488 --> 01:21:36,390
Trust is all we can give
to those who reach
into the new, sire.

886
01:21:38,894 --> 01:21:41,362
But when beauty
can be described
with such imagination,

887
01:21:41,364 --> 01:21:43,664
then her art,
above all I know,

888
01:21:44,866 --> 01:21:46,567
is worthy of the king.

889
01:21:50,538 --> 01:21:52,306
I see only mud.

890
01:21:56,044 --> 01:21:57,845
Your words
we will weigh later.

891
01:21:59,681 --> 01:22:01,548
For now,
inform <i> Madame</i> de Barra

892
01:22:01,550 --> 01:22:03,417
that I shall see her
at Fontainebleau.

893
01:22:36,284 --> 01:22:37,851
I do not know

894
01:22:39,120 --> 01:22:40,955
what story this tells

895
01:22:41,756 --> 01:22:43,824
or what harm it is part of.

896
01:22:45,961 --> 01:22:48,281
This is a bad end
for both of us,

897
01:22:49,965 --> 01:22:51,398
and I am sorry for it.

898
01:23:45,387 --> 01:23:46,653
<i>Welcome to Fontainebleau.</i>

899
01:23:46,655 --> 01:23:48,555
Antoine.
How beautiful you look.

900
01:23:50,191 --> 01:23:51,725
I believe it is compulsory.

901
01:23:51,727 --> 01:23:54,361
Indeed.
However, some of the ladies
find it more of a challenge.

902
01:23:54,363 --> 01:23:57,498
I am bound to say,
I see no trace of
that challenge in you.

903
01:23:57,500 --> 01:23:58,532
Do not talk to me
about it, <i> madame.</i>

904
01:23:58,534 --> 01:24:00,667
I am ruined by the expense,
and worse,

905
01:24:00,669 --> 01:24:02,909
it is interfering
with my gaming.

906
01:24:04,406 --> 01:24:07,526
I must confess that
escorting you down
is something of a coup.

907
01:24:08,209 --> 01:24:09,676
How so?

908
01:24:09,678 --> 01:24:11,878
There are several parties
who are anxious to meet you.

909
01:24:12,414 --> 01:24:13,814
I am no one.

910
01:24:13,816 --> 01:24:16,050
What could the interest be?

911
01:24:16,052 --> 01:24:17,384
<i>Madame,</i> you answer yourself.

912
01:24:18,319 --> 01:24:20,054
You see how they
look at you?

913
01:24:20,056 --> 01:24:22,189
You are no one
where everybody
is someone,

914
01:24:22,191 --> 01:24:24,058
and yet you are here.

915
01:24:24,060 --> 01:24:26,260
That makes you
more the someone.

916
01:24:26,262 --> 01:24:28,162
Especially if you
have conversation.

917
01:24:28,164 --> 01:24:29,897
Words just tumble.

918
01:24:32,367 --> 01:24:34,034
You see?

919
01:24:34,036 --> 01:24:37,371
People are looking
our way with interest,
because of my mirth.

920
01:24:37,373 --> 01:24:39,039
But the hordes may
not have you yet.

921
01:24:39,041 --> 01:24:42,242
I am under strict instruction
to convey you to one
person in particular.

922
01:24:42,244 --> 01:24:43,911
The Marquise de Montespan.

923
01:24:43,913 --> 01:24:47,081
Heavens, the lengths
I've had to go to, <i> madame.</i>

924
01:24:47,083 --> 01:24:51,018
I have had to bribe, lie
and use every form of
deception to meet you.

925
01:24:51,020 --> 01:24:52,453
How much did you pay
the maître d'hôtel?

926
01:24:52,455 --> 01:24:53,921
Five gold louis.
Was that too much?

927
01:24:53,923 --> 01:24:55,289
Money well spent.

928
01:24:55,291 --> 01:24:57,291
Lauzun, I love you dearly.

929
01:24:57,293 --> 01:25:00,027
Kiss me now and leave me
to explore my prize.

930
01:25:00,029 --> 01:25:02,029
I shall enjoy you later.

931
01:25:02,031 --> 01:25:04,064
<i>Madame.</i>
Good fortune
at the tables.

932
01:25:04,066 --> 01:25:06,133
I feel lucky tonight.

933
01:25:06,135 --> 01:25:08,869
My dearest friend
and a most divine lover.

934
01:25:08,871 --> 01:25:10,104
What can I say, <i> madame?</i>

935
01:25:10,106 --> 01:25:13,107
Events overtook us before
I had the king's interest.

936
01:25:13,109 --> 01:25:15,042
Is this your first time
at Fontainebleau?

937
01:25:15,044 --> 01:25:16,877
It is.
Have you no birth?

938
01:25:16,879 --> 01:25:19,079
Not a drop.
No blood whatsoever.

939
01:25:19,081 --> 01:25:21,482
You are here entirely
on your own merits.

940
01:25:21,484 --> 01:25:22,716
I know a famous man.

941
01:25:22,718 --> 01:25:23,884
Ah, I see.

942
01:25:23,886 --> 01:25:24,985
I was going to
offer you Lauzun,

943
01:25:24,987 --> 01:25:26,086
but you're
ahead of the game.

944
01:25:26,088 --> 01:25:28,522
Athenais.
Palatine.

945
01:25:31,926 --> 01:25:33,827
And <i> Madame</i> de Barra.

946
01:25:33,829 --> 01:25:35,789
I'm so happy
to see you again.

947
01:25:36,064 --> 01:25:37,431
Princess.

948
01:25:37,433 --> 01:25:39,066
Oh, please, call me <i> madame.</i>

949
01:25:39,068 --> 01:25:40,834
It's affectionate,
and everybody does.

950
01:25:40,836 --> 01:25:43,137
Come. My secret space.

951
01:25:50,145 --> 01:25:52,646
Do you dig earth?
Yes.

952
01:25:52,648 --> 01:25:55,115
Yet you're not
blackened by the sun.

953
01:25:55,117 --> 01:25:56,350
Perhaps a little.

954
01:25:56,352 --> 01:25:59,253
And never had the smallpox.
Your skin is clear.

955
01:25:59,255 --> 01:26:01,855
Show us your breasts.
Are they pretty?

956
01:26:01,857 --> 01:26:03,924
Would you like to see mine?
Mine are the most beautiful.

957
01:26:03,926 --> 01:26:07,361
Yes, they are,
apart from Suzanne,
who's 70.

958
01:26:07,363 --> 01:26:09,463
Oh, yes, hers are perfect.

959
01:26:09,465 --> 01:26:12,766
You see, here, touch.
Oh!

960
01:26:15,870 --> 01:26:17,604
Your eyes
are the color of the sea.

961
01:26:17,606 --> 01:26:20,040
This gown is cut differently.

962
01:26:20,042 --> 01:26:21,308
I like it at the waist.

963
01:26:21,310 --> 01:26:22,943
Are you married?

964
01:26:22,945 --> 01:26:25,212
Widowed.
Did you like
your husband?

965
01:26:25,214 --> 01:26:26,680
- Yes.
- Children?

966
01:26:30,318 --> 01:26:31,618
Dead?

967
01:26:32,687 --> 01:26:33,754
A girl.

968
01:26:35,823 --> 01:26:37,023
How old?

969
01:26:38,726 --> 01:26:40,360
Six.

970
01:26:40,362 --> 01:26:42,763
Palatine has
lost her son, too.

971
01:26:45,200 --> 01:26:46,733
He was four.

972
01:26:47,635 --> 01:26:49,303
So little and beautiful.

973
01:26:50,004 --> 01:26:51,872
Charles was one.

974
01:26:51,874 --> 01:26:54,034
I lost Joan and Ann together.

975
01:26:54,709 --> 01:26:56,476
Smallpox.

976
01:26:56,478 --> 01:26:59,546
I lost my husband
and my son
on the battlefield.

977
01:26:59,548 --> 01:27:01,788
They died in
each other's arms.

978
01:27:03,418 --> 01:27:04,651
I'm barely here.

979
01:27:06,221 --> 01:27:07,221
How did they die?

980
01:27:10,592 --> 01:27:12,259
Do you find it
hard to speak of it?

981
01:27:13,595 --> 01:27:14,828
That can happen.

982
01:27:19,267 --> 01:27:20,734
I put everything in a trunk.

983
01:27:23,504 --> 01:27:25,505
All their clothes, shoes,

984
01:27:27,041 --> 01:27:28,575
her toys.

985
01:27:29,944 --> 01:27:32,446
I haven't had the courage
to go in there since.

986
01:27:36,251 --> 01:27:38,885
When you are
strong enough,
my dear,

987
01:27:38,887 --> 01:27:41,421
when you are strong enough.

988
01:27:41,423 --> 01:27:43,624
We're not
allowed to speak of death
at court.

989
01:27:45,226 --> 01:27:46,927
The king does not like it,

990
01:27:46,929 --> 01:27:49,029
but we speak about it
amongst ourselves.

991
01:27:49,031 --> 01:27:52,866
Nobody may ban a child
from its mother's heart.

992
01:27:55,770 --> 01:27:59,439
I commended all my children
into Maintenon's care.

993
01:27:59,441 --> 01:28:01,508
How she has turned on me now.

994
01:28:03,811 --> 01:28:06,813
Saintly old bitch.

995
01:28:06,815 --> 01:28:10,717
It is an amazement
to me a convent
has not claimed her.

996
01:28:10,719 --> 01:28:12,386
Costume's not as lavish.

997
01:28:15,224 --> 01:28:16,690
Oh. The king comes.

998
01:28:18,159 --> 01:28:19,839
Have you been presented before?

999
01:28:20,662 --> 01:28:21,795
No.

1000
01:28:57,665 --> 01:28:59,833
Your Majesty,
it is my pleasure

1001
01:28:59,835 --> 01:29:01,995
to present <i>Madame</i> de Barra.

1002
01:29:04,038 --> 01:29:05,158
<i>Madame.</i>

1003
01:29:08,443 --> 01:29:09,609
Your Majesty.

1004
01:29:14,382 --> 01:29:15,882
Is it a Four Seasons?

1005
01:29:17,151 --> 01:29:18,919
It is, sire.

1006
01:29:20,154 --> 01:29:22,422
For the most famous
gardener in the world.

1007
01:29:26,127 --> 01:29:27,427
Allow me,

1008
01:29:28,129 --> 01:29:29,429
Your Majesty.

1009
01:29:37,905 --> 01:29:40,240
A light, honest scent.

1010
01:29:43,478 --> 01:29:45,645
Natural and unforced.

1011
01:29:49,183 --> 01:29:51,303
Some of the roses seem faded

1012
01:29:52,086 --> 01:29:53,754
and overblown.

1013
01:30:00,895 --> 01:30:02,829
That fate awaits
all roses, sire.

1014
01:30:07,769 --> 01:30:09,169
Continue, <i> madame.</i>

1015
01:30:11,038 --> 01:30:13,907
All roses are open
to the elements,
Your Majesty.

1016
01:30:14,742 --> 01:30:16,943
They bud, bloom and fade.

1017
01:30:19,680 --> 01:30:21,248
Is that so, <i> madame?</i>

1018
01:30:21,250 --> 01:30:24,284
The rose grows entirely unaware,

1019
01:30:24,286 --> 01:30:28,088
changing naturally
from one state to another,

1020
01:30:28,090 --> 01:30:31,224
and although the elements
may treat her cruelly,

1021
01:30:31,226 --> 01:30:34,561
she knows nothing of it
and continues to her end

1022
01:30:34,563 --> 01:30:36,530
without judgment on her beauty.

1023
01:30:37,965 --> 01:30:39,866
Alas,

1024
01:30:39,868 --> 01:30:41,435
'tis not the same for us.

1025
01:30:44,038 --> 01:30:46,273
If such a rose could speak,

1026
01:30:48,576 --> 01:30:49,976
what would she say?

1027
01:30:52,713 --> 01:30:54,381
Yes, I am here

1028
01:30:55,716 --> 01:30:57,951
and gave service
under nature's eye,

1029
01:30:59,053 --> 01:31:02,222
and after me,
my children will be.

1030
01:31:04,258 --> 01:31:06,827
Is there any
greater contribution
or more graceful end?

1031
01:31:08,563 --> 01:31:10,030
A wise rose.

1032
01:31:14,936 --> 01:31:19,105
And what protection
can the gardener
afford this rose

1033
01:31:19,107 --> 01:31:21,308
from the harsh
elements of change?

1034
01:31:22,477 --> 01:31:24,311
Patience, care

1035
01:31:25,480 --> 01:31:27,514
and a little warmth
from the sun

1036
01:31:27,516 --> 01:31:28,982
are our best hope,
Your Majesty.

1037
01:31:44,765 --> 01:31:48,001
I'm obliged to you, <i> madame,</i>
for that sweet reminder.

1038
01:31:55,476 --> 01:31:57,010
Now walk with me.

1039
01:31:59,514 --> 01:32:02,382
And tell me of

1040
01:32:02,384 --> 01:32:04,451
your progress in our garden.

1041
01:32:31,979 --> 01:32:33,813
Her kindness,

1042
01:32:34,415 --> 01:32:36,049
unbribed.

1043
01:32:48,729 --> 01:32:50,769
That was very brave tonight.

1044
01:32:53,234 --> 01:32:54,668
I hoped he might listen.

1045
01:32:54,670 --> 01:32:55,902
Enough humility.

1046
01:36:13,534 --> 01:36:14,934
There you are.

1047
01:36:16,637 --> 01:36:17,871
Philippe.

1048
01:36:27,882 --> 01:36:28,982
You're dressed.

1049
01:36:28,984 --> 01:36:31,417
I'm off on business to Chartres.

1050
01:36:31,419 --> 01:36:33,419
Thought I would
take Marie-Claire.

1051
01:36:33,421 --> 01:36:35,181
There's a good puppet
stand and a pie shop.

1052
01:36:37,625 --> 01:36:39,259
Marie-Claire!
Are you there?

1053
01:36:39,261 --> 01:36:41,795
Papa! Did you find her?

1054
01:36:41,797 --> 01:36:44,831
Here is Belle Boobie
asleep with Mama.

1055
01:36:44,833 --> 01:36:46,766
Hello, Marie-Claire.

1056
01:36:46,768 --> 01:36:47,967
You naughty doll!

1057
01:36:47,969 --> 01:36:49,729
Come here and I
shall punish you.

1058
01:36:51,472 --> 01:36:53,406
Oh, my goodness.
Is she all right?

1059
01:36:53,408 --> 01:36:55,608
Don't be silly.
She's made of cloth.

1060
01:37:00,281 --> 01:37:01,801
Sabine, I have
something to tell you.

1061
01:37:03,951 --> 01:37:05,151
<i>How long?</i>

1062
01:37:05,153 --> 01:37:06,353
<i>We've not been close of late.</i>

1063
01:37:07,988 --> 01:37:11,691
And most men take
mistresses in due course
in such circumstances.

1064
01:37:11,693 --> 01:37:12,933
Such circumstances?

1065
01:37:14,962 --> 01:37:16,329
What's her name?

1066
01:37:17,631 --> 01:37:19,032
Diane.

1067
01:37:19,034 --> 01:37:20,200
Where does she live?

1068
01:37:21,635 --> 01:37:22,635
Berry.

1069
01:37:22,870 --> 01:37:23,937
Oh.

1070
01:37:24,805 --> 01:37:26,372
Not too far.

1071
01:37:28,609 --> 01:37:29,776
There's the coach now.

1072
01:37:30,845 --> 01:37:32,278
We'll talk again
on this matter.

1073
01:37:36,817 --> 01:37:38,117
When will you be back?

1074
01:37:39,954 --> 01:37:41,721
This evening, <i> madame.</i>

1075
01:37:41,723 --> 01:37:44,691
Do not <i> "madame"</i> me, Philippe.

1076
01:37:52,066 --> 01:37:55,802
Marie-Claire, tie your laces.
You'll fall over them.

1077
01:37:55,804 --> 01:37:58,104
I can't, Mama.
Wait there.

1078
01:38:03,177 --> 01:38:04,644
Master, look at this.

1079
01:38:08,382 --> 01:38:09,616
Marie-Claire.

1080
01:38:11,151 --> 01:38:13,052
Marie-Claire.

1081
01:38:15,856 --> 01:38:17,390
Jean, the wheel.

1082
01:38:17,392 --> 01:38:19,225
I told the master.

1083
01:38:19,227 --> 01:38:20,547
He said it would
do until Berry.

1084
01:38:21,695 --> 01:38:23,096
Berry?

1085
01:38:26,767 --> 01:38:28,902
Marie-Claire!

1086
01:38:28,904 --> 01:38:30,303
I did not kiss Mama.

1087
01:38:45,753 --> 01:38:47,620
Stop! Stop!

1088
01:39:01,602 --> 01:39:02,869
No, no!

1089
01:39:16,383 --> 01:39:19,953
No! No!

1090
01:39:20,621 --> 01:39:21,888
Sabine!

1091
01:39:38,605 --> 01:39:41,307
She was the most
beautiful thing I ever made,

1092
01:39:41,309 --> 01:39:42,509
and I killed her.

1093
01:39:47,781 --> 01:39:50,483
Did you intend them to die?
Is that what you planned?

1094
01:39:51,852 --> 01:39:53,920
It was...
It was your husband's choice.

1095
01:39:53,922 --> 01:39:55,254
He took away the child.

1096
01:39:55,256 --> 01:39:56,522
No, it was my fault.

1097
01:39:56,524 --> 01:39:59,425
It was my fault.
I let him take her away.

1098
01:39:59,427 --> 01:40:01,861
What if no one
person is to blame?

1099
01:40:01,863 --> 01:40:03,296
And what use is blame?

1100
01:40:03,298 --> 01:40:04,497
It is enough to
have it happen to you.

1101
01:40:04,499 --> 01:40:06,379
It is enough to recover from it.

1102
01:40:08,302 --> 01:40:09,969
That is as much as we
may ask of ourselves.

1103
01:40:09,971 --> 01:40:11,371
That is enough.

1104
01:40:17,644 --> 01:40:19,484
What is it that
would help you?

1105
01:40:20,848 --> 01:40:22,415
If you held me.

1106
01:40:37,197 --> 01:40:39,317
What will happen
to your wife?

1107
01:40:45,239 --> 01:40:46,799
This was not
the way we started.

1108
01:40:50,077 --> 01:40:52,412
So we must have taught
each other how to behave.

1109
01:40:56,250 --> 01:40:58,151
I am to blame for it
as much as she.

1110
01:41:04,058 --> 01:41:05,892
She will live her own life.

1111
01:41:07,494 --> 01:41:09,062
She knows that now.

1112
01:41:13,333 --> 01:41:14,634
And us?

1113
01:41:19,273 --> 01:41:20,673
We will shape each other.

1114
01:41:47,468 --> 01:41:49,202
This isn't the right way.

1115
01:41:49,204 --> 01:41:51,871
Yes, it is.
We're behind that fence.
Oh!

1116
01:41:52,639 --> 01:41:54,040
For heaven's sake!

1117
01:41:54,942 --> 01:41:56,709
I have to rent this.

1118
01:41:56,711 --> 01:41:58,277
Waste of money!

1119
01:41:58,279 --> 01:41:59,445
What do you mean?

1120
01:41:59,447 --> 01:42:01,547
No one will see us.

1121
01:42:01,549 --> 01:42:04,183
The music comes
from the heavens.

1122
01:42:53,200 --> 01:42:54,534
Fair winds, Sabine.

1123
01:43:07,381 --> 01:43:09,461
<i>Madame</i> is lucky
in her friends.

1124
01:44:23,357 --> 01:44:24,457
He loves it.

1125
01:45:47,374 --> 01:45:48,614
Do I look very flushed?

1126
01:45:50,377 --> 01:45:51,777
No, you look beautiful.

1127
01:45:51,779 --> 01:45:53,112
Are you flattering me?

1128
01:45:53,680 --> 01:45:54,920
Is that wrong?

1129
01:45:57,017 --> 01:45:58,551
Call me <i> madame</i> again.
