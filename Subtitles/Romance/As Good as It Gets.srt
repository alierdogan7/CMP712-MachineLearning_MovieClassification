Any chance you'll be back at work today?
No!

Stay away from me!

Simon.
Huh?

675
00:48:38,674 --> 00:48:42,218
Simon, could you just
leave the dog for a second?

676
00:48:42,303 --> 00:48:45,555
Sorry.

have notes so I did this right.

They didn't hang up or anything.

feel strange about calling you.

Well, I can't call them.

Oh, God. I'm sorry. I did not mean that.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

I didn't mean that, sweetheart.

I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

00:50:03,300 --> 00:50:05,718
Uh...

697
00:50:07,638 --> 00:50:12,225
Wow.
Oh, my God. Wow.

Thank you.
That's good.

You have no idea
what your work means to me.

What does it mean to you?

knows what it's like...

00:51:37,561 --> 00:51:39,562
to be in here.

This is like a nightmare.

Oh, come on. Just a couple of questions.
How hard is that?

How do you write women so well?

me your name for? Where is he?

testing for allergies?

No. No standard scratch test?

it and that it wasn't necessary anyways.

What happened
to your queer party friends?

837
00:59:20,190 --> 00:59:21,774
Get outta here!

838
00:59:28,156 --> 00:59:31,033
Nothing worse than having to
feel this way in front of you.

839
00:59:31,117 --> 00:59:34,745
Nellie, you're a disgrace to depression.

840
00:59:39,125 --> 00:59:41,377
Rot in hell, Melvin.

841
00:59:41,461 --> 00:59:44,880
No need to stop bein' a lady.
Quit worryin'.

842
00:59:44,965 --> 00:59:48,050
You'll be back on your knees in no time.

843
00:59:48,134 --> 00:59:50,052
[Grunts]

844
00:59:53,139 --> 00:59:55,724
Whee-Whee-Whee.
[Barks]

845
00:59:56,977 --> 01:00:00,229
Is this fun for you, hmm?

846
01:00:00,313 --> 01:00:04,233
Well, you lucky devil, it just keeps
gettin' better and better, doesn't it?

847
01:00:04,317 --> 01:00:08,237
I'm losing my apartment, Melvin,
and Frank, he wants me...

848
01:00:08,321 --> 01:00:13,284
to beg my parents... who haven't
called me... for help, and I won't.

849
01:00:13,368 --> 01:00:18,080
And I-I don't want to paint anymore.

850
01:00:18,164 --> 01:00:21,750
So, the life that I was
trying for is over.

851
01:00:21,835 --> 01:00:25,087
The life that I had is gone,
and I'm feeling so damn sorry...

852
01:00:25,171 --> 01:00:28,257
for myself that it's difficult to breathe.

853
01:00:28,341 --> 01:00:30,843
It's high times for you,
isn't it, Melvin?

854
01:00:30,927 --> 01:00:36,015
The gay neighbor is terrified.
Terrified!

855
01:00:44,608 --> 01:00:46,525
[Mumbles]

856
01:00:47,986 --> 01:00:51,196
I was just trying to give you a boost.

857
01:00:52,616 --> 01:00:57,411
Lucky you, you're here for rock bottom.

858
01:00:57,495 --> 01:01:01,373
You absolute horror of a human being.

859
01:01:04,377 --> 01:01:06,337
[Sighs Slowly]

860
01:01:14,679 --> 01:01:18,849
The one thing I'll do for you.
I, uh, might cheer you up.

861
01:01:18,933 --> 01:01:20,476
Get out.

862
01:01:21,936 --> 01:01:24,772
You wanna know why that dog prefers me?

863
01:01:24,856 --> 01:01:28,525
It's not affection.
It's a trick.

864
01:01:30,737 --> 01:01:34,156
I keep bacon in my pocket.

865
01:01:34,240 --> 01:01:36,116
[Barking]
See?

866
01:01:36,242 --> 01:01:40,704
[Laughing] Oh, my gosh.
Huh?

867
01:01:43,583 --> 01:01:49,213
We'll both call him.
You'll see. It's a... trick.

868
01:01:49,297 --> 01:01:51,382
Okay?

869
01:01:56,096 --> 01:01:58,847
Come here, Verdell.

870
01:01:58,932 --> 01:02:03,477
Come here.
Oop. Oop.

871
01:02:03,561 --> 01:02:07,189
- Yo, yo.
- Come on.

872
01:02:07,273 --> 01:02:09,358
[Laughs]
Come here.

873
01:02:09,484 --> 01:02:11,902
Come here, baby.
No.

874
01:02:12,028 --> 01:02:14,363
It's okay. Come here.
[Grunts]

875

[Groans]

876
01:02:16,449 --> 01:02:20,035
[Spits]
Just a stupid, stupid dog.

877
01:02:20,120 --> 01:02:22,037
[Barks]

878
01:02:22,122 --> 01:02:24,123
Could you leave now?

879
01:02:25,959 --> 01:02:28,293
Please.

880
01:02:28,378 --> 01:02:33,549
I don't get it.
I don't get it.

881
01:02:33,633 --> 01:02:35,592
[Ticking]

882
01:02:59,367 --> 01:03:01,827

[Whispering]
Oh, sorry.

886
01:03:58,635 --> 01:04:01,094
[TV Announcer] Again with Nick
at Nite's Classic TV Rewind.

887
01:04:01,221 --> 01:04:03,180
[Buzzing]
On repeat viewing,

888
01:04:03,264 --> 01:04:07,810
one begins to suspect that might not really
be Major Healey in the phone booth after all.

889
01:04:07,894 --> 01:04:10,312
[Coughing]
Mr. Udall?

890
01:04:10,396 --> 01:04:13,373
[TV Announcer] A second look at shows
that are always worth a second look.

891
01:04:13,457 --> 01:04:15,150
- Carol, the waitress?
- Yes.

892
01:04:15,235 --> 01:04:18,070
[TV Continues, indistinct]

893
01:04:20,990 --> 01:04:22,908
[Gasps]

894
01:04:22,992 --> 01:04:25,118
Hi.

895
01:04:25,203 --> 01:04:29,331
The doctors gave me your billing address.
I'm sorry about the hour.

896
01:04:30,834 --> 01:04:34,503
[TV Announcer Continues]
Um... [Chuckles]

897
01:04:36,589 --> 01:04:40,384
If you're, uh...
[Laughs]

898
01:04:40,510 --> 01:04:46,306
[TV Switches Off] Um, if you're,
uh, worried about thanking me, uh...

899
01:04:46,391 --> 01:04:49,059
That's not why I'm here.

900
01:04:49,143 --> 01:04:52,729
Though you have no idea what it's
like to have a real conversation...

901
01:04:52,814 --> 01:04:55,440
with a doctor about Spencer.

902
01:04:57,068 --> 01:05:00,779
Uh, note... Put it in a note.

903
01:05:01,823 --> 01:05:04,074
[Exhaling]

904
01:05:05,451 --> 01:05:07,703
Uh...

905
01:05:07,787 --> 01:05:10,372
Oh.
So, I have...

906
01:05:10,456 --> 01:05:13,876
I have a hair dryer, uh...

907
01:05:13,960 --> 01:05:16,378
Why did you do this for me?

908
01:05:18,840 --> 01:05:21,717
So you'd come back to work
and wait on me.

909
01:05:22,886 --> 01:05:26,388
Do have some idea
how strange that sounds?

910
01:05:26,514 --> 01:05:29,766
Well, I mean...
I'm worried you did this be...

911
01:05:46,743 --> 01:05:50,162
Are you waiting for me to say something?

912
01:05:53,917 --> 01:05:55,834
Look, uh,

913
01:05:57,128 --> 01:06:00,130
I'll be at the restaurant tomorrow.

914
01:06:00,214 --> 01:06:05,093
I don't think this can wait until tomorrow.
I need to clear this up now.

915
01:06:05,178 --> 01:06:07,095
Clear what up?

916
01:06:09,390 --> 01:06:11,642
I'm not going to sleep with you.

917
01:06:11,726 --> 01:06:14,603
I will never sleep with you.
Never, ever.

918
01:06:16,189 --> 01:06:18,106
Not ever.

919
01:06:22,612 --> 01:06:24,529
Well.

920
01:06:24,614 --> 01:06:28,825
[Clicks Tongue]
I'm sorry, but, um...

921
01:06:28,910 --> 01:06:32,663
we don't open for the no-sex
oaths until 9:00 a.m.

922
01:06:34,123 --> 01:06:36,041
I'm not kidding.

923
01:06:37,293 --> 01:06:39,211
Anything else?

924
01:06:41,839 --> 01:06:44,549
Uh, just...

925
01:06:46,844 --> 01:06:48,762
thank you.

926
01:06:52,892 --> 01:06:55,018
So, you'll be at work tomorrow?

927
01:06:59,357 --> 01:07:01,566
Yes.

930
01:07:15,581 --> 01:07:19,793
"Never," she said.

[Chains Clanking]

934
01:07:37,895 --> 01:07:41,690
I took a chan...
took a chance you were up.

935
01:07:41,774 --> 01:07:45,527
Uh, I brought you some Chinese soup.

936
01:07:45,611 --> 01:07:49,364
Uh, thanks.

[Grunts, Inhales Sharply]

938
01:08:03,671 --> 01:08:06,173
Boy.

939
01:08:06,257 --> 01:08:08,967
I've never been this tired in my life.

940
01:08:16,893 --> 01:08:18,810
I haven't been sleepin'.

941
01:08:21,606 --> 01:08:24,232
I haven't been clear in my head...

942
01:08:24,317 --> 01:08:26,777
or felt like myself.

943
01:08:28,821 --> 01:08:30,781
I'm in trouble.

944
01:08:32,658 --> 01:08:35,619
It's not just the tiredness.

945
01:08:35,745 --> 01:08:39,456
Boy. It's sick.
Nauseous.

946
01:08:39,540 --> 01:08:41,500
Sleepy.

947
01:08:41,584 --> 01:08:43,752
Where everything looks distorted,

948
01:08:43,836 --> 01:08:47,339
and everything inside
just kind of aches...

949
01:08:47,423 --> 01:08:50,467
and you can barely find
the will to complain.

950
01:08:50,551 --> 01:08:53,261
Yeah.
Yeah.

951
01:08:53,346 --> 01:08:55,764
Oh.

952
01:08:55,848 --> 01:08:58,850
I'm glad we did this.

953
01:09:00,186 --> 01:09:02,604
Good talking to you.

954
01:09:02,688 --> 01:09:05,107
[Door Closing]

955
01:09:10,696 --> 01:09:13,448
You are not still writing
that thank... you note?

956
01:09:13,533 --> 01:09:17,202
I'm on the last page.
How do you spell "conscience"?

957
01:09:17,286 --> 01:09:21,164
[Sighs]
C-O-N-S-C-I-E-N-C-E.

958
01:09:21,249 --> 01:09:26,461
Look, I got Sean from the bakery
to baby-sit so we could go out.

959
01:09:26,546 --> 01:09:28,880
I still don't feel safe
leaving Spencer with someone.

960
01:09:28,965 --> 01:09:32,425
- Could you spell it again, please?
- Spencer's okay.

961
01:09:32,510 --> 01:09:36,805
You better start finding something
else to do with your free time.

962
01:09:36,889 --> 01:09:39,474
- Sean, are you hungry?
- [Sean] Yeah.

963
01:09:39,559 --> 01:09:42,144
[Beverly] All right.
We got pizza!

964
01:09:42,228 --> 01:09:44,396
Carol and I are going out.

965
01:09:44,480 --> 01:09:47,607
Sausage, pepperoni. You wanna make
this later for you and Spencer?

966
01:09:47,733 --> 01:09:52,404
[Sean] Great.
[Sighs] We are goin' out like people do.

967
01:09:54,991 --> 01:09:58,243
If you can't feel good about this break...

968
01:09:58,327 --> 01:10:02,205
and step out a little, then I...

969
01:10:02,290 --> 01:10:07,586
I think you ought to have Mr. Udall
send you over a psychiatrist.

970
01:10:07,670 --> 01:10:10,589
I don't need one, 'cause I know
what's really going on here!

971
01:10:12,091 --> 01:10:15,010
I gotta finish this letter,
or I'll go nuts.

972
01:10:15,094 --> 01:10:19,347
- Carol...
- This can't be right. "Con-science"?

973
01:10:19,432 --> 01:10:21,391
Carol?

974
01:10:25,146 --> 01:10:27,105
What?

975
01:10:33,988 --> 01:10:35,947
[Gasping]

976
01:10:44,081 --> 01:10:47,792
It's very weird now, not feeling that...

977
01:10:47,877 --> 01:10:50,795
stupid panic thing
inside me all the time.

978
01:10:52,965 --> 01:10:56,051
Without that, I just start
thinking about myself, and...

979
01:10:56,135 --> 01:10:59,304
what good does that ever get anybody?

980
01:10:59,388 --> 01:11:01,306
[Sniffling]

981
01:11:03,017 --> 01:11:06,603
Today, on the bus, there
was this adorable couple,

982
01:11:06,687 --> 01:11:09,731
and I felt myself...

983
01:11:09,815 --> 01:11:12,943
giving 'em a dirty look.

984
01:11:14,987 --> 01:11:20,408
I just had no idea everything was...

985
01:11:20,493 --> 01:11:22,911
[Crying, Breathless]

986
01:11:22,995 --> 01:11:25,497
[Gasping]

987
01:11:27,083 --> 01:11:29,501
Go ahead.

988
01:11:31,963 --> 01:11:34,839
Moving in the wrong direction...

989
01:11:34,924 --> 01:11:39,302
away from a time when I
remembered what it was like...

990
01:11:39,387 --> 01:11:42,389
to have a man to anything.

991
01:11:42,473 --> 01:11:44,891
Hold, fucking...

992
01:11:45,017 --> 01:11:48,186
Sorry... No, it's okay.

993
01:11:48,271 --> 01:11:51,982
Hands with, for Christ sake!

994
01:11:52,066 --> 01:11:53,984
And...

995
01:11:54,068 --> 01:11:57,612
I felt almost...

996
01:11:57,697 --> 01:12:01,157
r-really bad that Dr. Bettes is married.

997
01:12:01,242 --> 01:12:04,286
[Laughing]

998
01:12:04,370 --> 01:12:08,206
Which is probably why I make poor
Spencer hug me more than he wants to.

[Sniffles]

1000
01:12:10,293 --> 01:12:13,044
The poor kid doesn't have
enough problems.

1001
01:12:13,129 --> 01:12:16,131
He has to make up
for his mom not getting any.

[Exhales]

1003
01:12:20,177 --> 01:12:22,554
Who needs these thoughts?

1004
01:12:22,638 --> 01:12:25,851
So, what are you saying?
That you're frustrated?

1005
01:12:25,876 --> 01:12:27,076
Leave me be!

1006
01:12:27,977 --> 01:12:31,813
[Knocks Table] Why are you doing this?
What is it you want?

1007
01:12:31,897 --> 01:12:34,140
I hope getting me thinking
about everything that's wrong,

1008
01:12:34,225 --> 01:12:38,370
when all I want to do is
not do that, has some purpose.

1009
01:12:39,739 --> 01:12:42,157
Really, Mom, what is it you want?

1010
01:12:42,241 --> 01:12:44,159
What?

1011
01:12:44,243 --> 01:12:46,578
I want us to go out.

1012
01:12:55,087 --> 01:12:57,213
Okay.

1013
01:12:57,298 --> 01:13:00,133
[Woman] Like spiral curls and barrel
curls and everything like that.

1014
01:13:00,217 --> 01:13:03,928
[Man] I gotta go, Jimbo. I'll see ya.
Take care, babe.

1015
01:13:04,013 --> 01:13:07,515
[Man #2] Because I love you.
[Woman] Oh.

1016
01:13:07,600 --> 01:13:10,560
[Man #2] You know, it's got those big
windows, and there's lots of light.

1017
01:13:10,603 --> 01:13:12,729
[Man #3] Yeah, I don't
know where my wife is.

1018
01:13:12,813 --> 01:13:15,815
[Chattering Continues, Indistinct]

1019
01:13:17,193 --> 01:13:20,487
Thank you. Now, I gotta
send you a thank-you note.

1020
01:13:20,571 --> 01:13:22,489
[Laughing]

1021
01:13:22,573 --> 01:13:26,701
Oh, look, Evelyn's here,
and her giant Joey.

1022
01:13:26,786 --> 01:13:29,371
[Woman]
Beverly!

1023
01:13:29,455 --> 01:13:32,306
That's why you brought me here.
That's really why you brought me here.

1024
01:13:32,391 --> 01:13:34,626
Well, you know, it's not even mine.

1025
01:13:34,710 --> 01:13:37,837
And this guy Simon seems
to have enough on his mind.

1026
01:13:37,922 --> 01:13:42,050
But the dog did throw up twice
last night and his spark is off.

1027
01:13:42,176 --> 01:13:45,053
Well, take him to the vet.
I did.

1028
01:13:45,137 --> 01:13:49,265
They say his stomach's out of whack and
they need him for a couple of days.

1029
01:13:49,350 --> 01:13:50,975
Well, do it.
What d...

1030
01:13:52,061 --> 01:13:54,813
[Frank] Sorry.
Excuse me.

1031
01:13:54,897 --> 01:13:57,732
Okay.
Now, this is for later.

1032
01:13:57,817 --> 01:14:01,111
- What's this?
- Um, it's a note.

1033
01:14:01,195 --> 01:14:05,740
- A note?
- Yeah, it's a thank-you note.

1034
01:14:05,825 --> 01:14:07,951
Thank-you note?
No, no, no.

1035
01:14:08,035 --> 01:14:10,578
- You can read it later.
- No. No, thank you.

1036
01:14:10,663 --> 01:14:13,498
No. No, thank you.
No, no, no, no.

1037
01:14:13,582 --> 01:14:15,500
No.

1038
01:14:15,584 --> 01:14:19,337
Thank you.
Thank you.

1039
01:14:23,217 --> 01:14:25,343
She's nice.

1040
01:14:26,846 --> 01:14:29,222
Yeah.
Real nice, huh?

1041
01:14:29,306 --> 01:14:31,558
Really nice.

1042
01:14:33,310 --> 01:14:38,440
Shouldn't that be a good thing, telling
somebody, "No thanks required"?

1043
01:14:38,524 --> 01:14:39,774
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1044
01:14:39,859 --> 01:14:44,112
Sure looks like it went over too.
[Laughs]

1045
01:14:44,196 --> 01:14:47,323
I mean... look at you!

1046
01:14:49,201 --> 01:14:53,496
You're sure making the rounds.
Simon says you brought him soup last night.

1047
01:14:53,581 --> 01:14:56,040
[Continues Laughing]

1048
01:14:58,627 --> 01:15:01,921
- What?
- Look at you. You think I'm a mark.

1049
01:15:02,006 --> 01:15:04,382
You helped with the dog.
Now, there's other things.

1050
01:15:04,467 --> 01:15:07,260
Hey, I'm as concerned
about Simon as you are.

1051
01:15:07,386 --> 01:15:10,472
Concerned?
It's not just financial assistance.

1052
01:15:10,556 --> 01:15:13,683
He's gotta get to Baltimore to ask
his parents for money tomorrow.

1053
01:15:13,767 --> 01:15:15,977
Yeah, well, yeah.

1054
01:15:16,061 --> 01:15:19,439
I mean, if his parents are alive,
they have to help. It's the rules.

1055
01:15:19,565 --> 01:15:23,818
Good. That's great. Let them help him.
Absolutely.

1056
01:15:23,903 --> 01:15:27,238
Only, uh,

1057
01:15:27,323 --> 01:15:31,993
I got a high-maintenance selling
painter coming through, so I'm out.

1058
01:15:32,077 --> 01:15:34,162
Can you drive him?

1059
01:15:36,415 --> 01:15:39,876
Think white and get serious.

1060
01:15:39,960 --> 01:15:42,921
Take my car, a convertible?

1061
01:15:43,005 --> 01:15:45,882
[Laughing]
Do you drive?

1062
01:15:45,966 --> 01:15:49,010
Like the wind.
But I'm not doin' it!

1063
01:15:49,094 --> 01:15:51,596
Gettin' loud, gettin' loud.

1064
01:15:53,390 --> 01:15:56,059
He wants me to take his car
and his client to Baltimore.

1065
01:15:56,143 --> 01:15:57,555
I want your life for one minute,

1066
01:15:57,580 --> 01:16:00,380
where my big problem is somebody
offers me a free convertible...

1067
01:16:00,439 --> 01:16:03,608
so I can get out of this city.

1068
01:16:07,863 --> 01:16:11,115
[Stomps Foot]
Go ahead, girl.

1069
01:16:11,200 --> 01:16:15,203
[Sighs] Okay, I'll do it.
I'll take him.

1070
01:16:15,287 --> 01:16:16,875
Yeah, get him ready, packed.

1071
01:16:16,900 --> 01:16:19,500
Tomorrow morning, I'll take him.
Okay. I'll take him. Fine.

1072
01:16:21,001 --> 01:16:23,670
Okay.
Okay.

1073
01:16:23,754 --> 01:16:27,549
[Exhales] All right, I'll see you tomorrow.
Let's not drag this out.

1074
01:16:27,633 --> 01:16:31,219
We don't enjoy one another that much.

1075
01:16:34,890 --> 01:16:37,559
If there is some mental health
foundation that raises money...

1076
01:16:37,643 --> 01:16:40,436
for people like you,
please be sure to let me know.

1077
01:16:40,521 --> 01:16:43,273
Last-word freak.

1078
01:16:43,357 --> 01:16:45,233
Bye-bye.
Good luck, lady.

1079
01:16:45,359 --> 01:16:48,736
[Woman] Is he talking to me?
So, anything else?

1080
01:16:48,821 --> 01:16:50,488
Yeah.

1081
01:16:52,658 --> 01:16:55,451
I'm gonna give my queer neighbor
a lift to Baltimore.

1082
01:16:55,536 --> 01:16:58,413
Okay.

1083
01:16:58,497 --> 01:17:00,957
Hey.

1084
01:17:01,041 --> 01:17:04,002
What I did for you...
It's working out?

1085
01:17:08,007 --> 01:17:10,675
What you did changed my life.

1086
01:17:12,595 --> 01:17:15,513
No, uh...

1087
01:17:15,598 --> 01:17:18,141
Uh, no thank-you note.

1088
01:17:18,225 --> 01:17:21,561
Well, part of what I said
in this entire history of my life,

1089
01:17:21,645 --> 01:17:26,441
which you won't read, is that somehow...

1090
01:17:26,525 --> 01:17:32,071
you have done more for my mother, my
son and me than anybody else ever has.

1091
01:17:32,156 --> 01:17:37,160
I'm just gonna read you this part of it.

1092
01:17:37,244 --> 01:17:41,289
"And that makes you the most
important, surprising,

1093
01:17:41,373 --> 01:17:43,458
"generous person I ever met in my life,

1094
01:17:43,542 --> 01:17:46,461
"and that you're gonna be in our prayers,

1095
01:17:46,545 --> 01:17:48,463
our daily prayers, forever."

1096
01:17:48,547 --> 01:17:50,965
[Low Sigh]
Lovely.

1097
01:17:51,050 --> 01:17:53,426
I...

1098
01:17:53,510 --> 01:17:56,471
I also wrote one part...
I'm just gonna say...

1099
01:17:56,555 --> 01:17:59,807
I wrote, "I'm sorry."
I w...

1100
01:17:59,892 --> 01:18:05,063
I was talking about I was sorry
when I got mad at you for-for...

1101
01:18:05,147 --> 01:18:08,232
when you came over, and you told
my son that he oughta answer back.

1102
01:18:08,317 --> 01:18:11,277
So, I wrote that I was sorry
about that and that I...

1103
01:18:11,362 --> 01:18:13,804
I wrote I was sorry for bustin'
you on that and I'm sorry...

1104
01:18:13,889 --> 01:18:17,525
for bustin' in on you that
night when I said I was never...

1105
01:18:20,120 --> 01:18:23,164
I was sorry. And I'm sorry for
every time your food was cold,

1106
01:18:23,248 --> 01:18:26,167
and that you had to wait
two seconds for a coffee filler.

1107
01:18:26,251 --> 01:18:29,253
And I'm sorry for never spotting right
there at the table in the restaurant,

1108
01:18:29,338 --> 01:18:34,509
the human being that had it in
him to do this thing for us.

1109
01:18:34,593 --> 01:18:37,320
I'll just... You know what,
I'm just gonna start from the beginning.

1110
01:18:37,346 --> 01:18:39,764
[Whispers] Gee...
"I have not been able...

1111
01:18:39,848 --> 01:18:42,308
"to express my gratefulness to you.

1112
01:18:42,393 --> 01:18:46,521
Even as I look at the word 'grateful' now,
it doesn't begin to tell you what I feel."

1113
01:18:49,483 --> 01:18:52,568
Uh, that's...

1114
01:18:52,653 --> 01:18:55,697
I see it.
Thank you.

1115
01:18:57,282 --> 01:18:59,283
Thank you.

1116
01:19:04,998 --> 01:19:06,958
[Coughing]

1117
01:19:09,795 --> 01:19:12,088
Now, I want you to do something for me.

1118
01:19:19,888 --> 01:19:23,266
I'm sorry,
didn't I say, "What?"

1119
01:19:23,350 --> 01:19:25,810
I thought I said, "What?"

1120
01:19:27,896 --> 01:19:29,814
What?

1121
01:19:29,898 --> 01:19:32,233
I want you to go on this trip.

1122
01:19:32,317 --> 01:19:34,318
[Laughs]
No, sir.

1123
01:19:34,403 --> 01:19:36,404
I can't do this without you.

1124
01:19:36,488 --> 01:19:40,867
I'm afraid he might pull
the stiff one-eye on me.

1125
01:19:40,951 --> 01:19:44,954
I need you to chaperone.
Separate everything but cars.

1126
01:19:45,038 --> 01:19:47,582
You said you liked convertibles.
Now, I'm on the hook.

1127
01:19:47,666 --> 01:19:51,377
- I'm sorry, "the stiff one-eye"?
- Two days.

1128
01:19:51,503 --> 01:19:53,588
I can't. I work.
You get off when you want to.

1129
01:19:53,714 --> 01:19:56,591
My son.
Bettes said he's doing fine.

1130
01:19:58,260 --> 01:20:00,928
- Melvin, I'd rather not.
- What has that got to do with it?

1131
01:20:01,013 --> 01:20:05,016
- Funny, I thought it was a strong point.
- Write a note. Ain't she sweet.

1132
01:20:05,100 --> 01:20:07,602
I need a hand, and where'd she go?

1133
01:20:07,686 --> 01:20:10,521
Are you saying accepting
your help obligates me?

1134
01:20:11,982 --> 01:20:14,525
Is there any other way to see it?

1135
01:20:17,321 --> 01:20:19,363
No.

1136
01:20:25,204 --> 01:20:27,872
Here's a little suitcase...

1137
01:20:27,956 --> 01:20:30,792
shocked that it's being used.

1138
01:20:30,876 --> 01:20:33,127
[Banging]

1139
01:20:35,964 --> 01:20:37,882
[Sighs]

1140
01:20:39,718 --> 01:20:42,512
There's no way to pack for this trip.

1141
01:20:42,596 --> 01:20:44,555
Mm-hmm.

1142
01:20:46,225 --> 01:20:48,184
Yeah.

[Telephone Ringing]

1144
01:20:54,650 --> 01:20:56,567
Woo-woo.

[Clears Throat]

1147
01:21:04,284 --> 01:21:06,202
Hello?

1148
01:21:06,286 --> 01:21:10,164
You're still comin', aren't you?
Yes.

1149
01:21:10,249 --> 01:21:13,543
Melvin, I would like to know
exactly where we are going.

1150
01:21:13,627 --> 01:21:17,171
Um, just south of Baltimore, Maryland,

1151
01:21:17,256 --> 01:21:19,924
and, uh, I know what
you're gonna say next.

1152
01:21:20,008 --> 01:21:23,261
I mean, I think I know.

1153
01:21:23,345 --> 01:21:27,974
I'm not... I'm not sure, but I think so.

1154
01:21:28,058 --> 01:21:30,768
There's no need for me
to bring anything dressy?

1155
01:21:32,104 --> 01:21:34,272
I mean, I didn't know
if we were gonna be eating...

1156
01:21:34,356 --> 01:21:36,899
in any restaurants that have dress codes?

1157
01:21:38,360 --> 01:21:41,863
Well, I, uh...

1158
01:21:41,947 --> 01:21:44,073
I mean, maybe, uh...

1159
01:21:44,157 --> 01:21:46,409
I mean, yes!
Yes, let's.

1160
01:21:46,493 --> 01:21:49,370
Let's.
Okay, got ya.

1161
01:21:49,454 --> 01:21:51,455
[Exhales]

1162
01:21:51,540 --> 01:21:53,791
What did you think I was gonna ask?

1163
01:21:53,876 --> 01:21:56,544
Whether crabs were in season there now.

1164
01:21:56,628 --> 01:21:59,922
Oh, okay, then.

1165
01:22:00,007 --> 01:22:02,216
Good night.

1166
01:22:05,470 --> 01:22:08,389
[Barking, Distant] [Woman]
Anything unusual in the dog's diet?

1167
01:22:08,473 --> 01:22:12,435
No.
Uh, everybody gets their own cage?

1168
01:22:12,519 --> 01:22:13,305
Certainly.

1169
01:22:13,330 --> 01:22:15,330
Okay, put him in with that one,
not that one.

1170
01:22:15,731 --> 01:22:17,899
Builds his confidence, huh?
[Laughs] Okay.

1171
01:22:17,983 --> 01:22:20,443
Lip kiss.

1172
01:22:20,527 --> 01:22:22,320
Ah!

1173
01:22:22,404 --> 01:22:25,948
I love you.
I'll miss you.

1174
01:22:26,033 --> 01:22:28,951

and clear their tables and never get that
they just met the greatest woman alive.

makes me feel good...
