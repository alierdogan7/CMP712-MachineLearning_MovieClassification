00:01:07,212 --> 00:01:09,246
<i>(MAN) Will you smoke with me,</i>
<i>Da Vinci?</i>

4
00:01:09,314 --> 00:01:12,683
<i>Well, that depends</i>
<i>on what's in the pipe.</i>

5
00:01:12,751 --> 00:01:16,354
<i>It is a mixture of tobacco</i>
<i>and black hellebore</i>

6
00:01:16,488 --> 00:01:18,890
and is rumored
to induce visions

7
00:01:18,957 --> 00:01:20,625
and summon demons.

8
00:01:20,693 --> 00:01:22,893
Well, I believe in neither.

9
00:01:22,961 --> 00:01:27,632
Then why do you struggle so
hard to keep both at bay?

10
00:01:37,011 --> 00:01:39,746
History is a lie that has
been honed like a weapon

11
00:01:39,814 --> 00:01:42,116
<i>by people who have</i>
<i>suppressed the truth.</i>

12
00:01:42,183 --> 00:01:44,652
The knowledge you are
destined to learn

13
00:01:44,719 --> 00:01:47,421
will upend the established
order of things.

14
00:01:47,489 --> 00:01:49,624
How could you possibly
know that?

15
00:01:49,691 --> 00:01:51,411
You have heard the phrase
'Time is a river'?

16
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:52,794
Yes.

17
00:01:52,861 --> 00:01:57,665
What most fail to grasp is
that the river is circular.

18
00:01:57,733 --> 00:02:00,435
One man's death
opens a doorway

19
00:02:00,503 --> 00:02:02,170
to the birth
of the next.

20
00:02:03,072 --> 00:02:04,372
Would you like
to know how

21
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:06,841
this particular
doorway opened?

22
00:02:06,909 --> 00:02:08,309
Yes.

23
00:02:08,377 --> 00:02:11,279
Be forewarned, then.

24
00:02:11,347 --> 00:02:14,683
Some doorways
lead into darkness.

25
00:02:30,567 --> 00:02:31,666
(Urinates)

26
00:02:42,375 --> 00:02:46,144
Out you go, boy.
Get on with you!

27
00:02:46,212 --> 00:02:48,146
(Bell rings)

28
00:02:48,214 --> 00:02:50,248
(Chanting in Latin)

29
00:02:55,822 --> 00:02:58,490
Go on! Go on!

30
00:02:58,558 --> 00:03:01,059
(Coins scatter)

31
00:03:05,397 --> 00:03:07,298
Cicco!

32
00:03:10,767 --> 00:03:13,735
- What day is it today?
- Palm Sunday.

33
00:03:13,803 --> 00:03:15,370
Oh, balls.

34
00:03:15,438 --> 00:03:18,139
The Duchess and your children
are already at the church.

35
00:03:20,075 --> 00:03:22,241
Could you round me up
some coddled eggs?

36
00:03:22,309 --> 00:03:26,978
I have a beastly hangover and
my bowels are in a tumble.

37
00:03:27,046 --> 00:03:29,113
I'll be dressed
in but a minute.

38
00:03:32,116 --> 00:03:34,685
(Rings)

39
00:03:50,898 --> 00:03:53,732
At ease, people,
I've arrived!

40
00:03:58,235 --> 00:04:01,737
Be gone, you artless fuckwit.
This is my moment.

41
00:04:01,805 --> 00:04:03,338
And thanks to
the Secret Archives,

42
00:04:03,406 --> 00:04:05,440
it's the last you
will ever enjoy!

43
00:04:05,508 --> 00:04:07,275
Ah!

44
00:04:09,345 --> 00:04:11,712
(Women scream)

45
00:04:27,229 --> 00:04:29,497
<i>Tell me a secret,</i>
<i>Leonardo.</i>

46
00:04:29,565 --> 00:04:33,435
What was your...
earliest memory?

47
00:04:33,503 --> 00:04:35,537
Or better yet,

48
00:04:35,605 --> 00:04:37,573
your greatest fear?

49
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:39,241
In my case...

50
00:04:39,309 --> 00:04:41,277
the two go hand-in-hand.

51
00:04:41,345 --> 00:04:42,812
I was...um...

52
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,714
I was six months old.

53
00:04:44,782 --> 00:04:46,716
No-one remembers
back that far.

54
00:04:46,784 --> 00:04:48,284
Well, perhaps
I'm unique, then.

55
00:04:48,352 --> 00:04:51,688
- Oh.
- My mother...um...

56
00:04:53,157 --> 00:04:57,594
<i>...put me in a cradle</i>
<i>out in the field.</i>

57
00:04:57,661 --> 00:05:00,830
<i>And a falcon flew down.</i>
<i>I can still recall it.</i>

58
00:05:00,898 --> 00:05:04,834
It just perched there,
looking at me

59
00:05:04,902 --> 00:05:06,669
<i>almost as if it were</i>
<i>trying to reveal</i>

60
00:05:06,737 --> 00:05:09,072
<i>some kind</i>
<i>of mystery.</i>

61
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:10,640
<i>My mother drove it away.</i>

62
00:05:10,708 --> 00:05:13,510
Yet, as clear as
that memory is,

63
00:05:13,577 --> 00:05:15,745
the one thing I
can never recall..

64
00:05:15,813 --> 00:05:18,715
is my mother's face.

65
00:05:18,783 --> 00:05:24,388
I can draw anything I've
seen, even in passing.

66
00:05:24,456 --> 00:05:28,726
But when it comes to my
mother, all I see is a void.

67
00:05:28,794 --> 00:05:31,128
She disappeared that night
and I've been...

68
00:05:31,196 --> 00:05:33,231
trying to recall her face
ever since.

69
00:05:33,299 --> 00:05:35,600
All men are searching
for their mothers.

70
00:05:35,668 --> 00:05:37,969
That's what guides you
between our thighs.

71
00:05:38,037 --> 00:05:40,004
I pay you to pose,
Vanessa.

72
00:05:40,071 --> 00:05:42,272
Not to plumb the innermost
depths of my character.

73
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:44,641
If you expect me to bare
my figure for you,

74
00:05:44,709 --> 00:05:48,345
I expect you to bare
your soul in return.

75
00:05:48,413 --> 00:05:51,582
So, tell me, is there
nothing else you fear?

76
00:05:58,223 --> 00:06:00,191
Only imperfection.

77
00:06:00,259 --> 00:06:02,360
Maestro! Maestro!

78
00:06:02,428 --> 00:06:05,397
You're late, Nico.

79
00:06:05,465 --> 00:06:08,133
You're late. Verrocchio's
been looking for you.

80
00:06:08,201 --> 00:06:10,769
Well, he can wait. We've an
experiment to conduct.

81
00:06:10,837 --> 00:06:13,004
You're meant to play
a principal role in it.

82
00:06:13,072 --> 00:06:15,107
- Come on!
- Hello.

83
00:06:15,175 --> 00:06:18,243
They're called breasts, Nico.
Every woman possesses them.

84
00:06:18,311 --> 00:06:20,412
<i>Nico!</i>
That's Vanessa.

85
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:23,381
She's newly liberated from
the Convent of St Anthony.

86
00:06:23,449 --> 00:06:27,052
Now help me do this.

87
00:06:27,119 --> 00:06:29,087
Climb into that harness.

88
00:06:29,155 --> 00:06:30,956
Hey today,

89
00:06:31,024 --> 00:06:33,093
we are attempting to
ascertain whether or not

90
00:06:33,161 --> 00:06:35,596
this kite can provide the
necessary wind resistance

91
00:06:35,664 --> 00:06:36,797
to support
your weight.

92
00:06:36,865 --> 00:06:38,566
Well, Maestro,
what if it can't?

93
00:06:38,633 --> 00:06:41,402
Vanessa, do you mind just
dancing about for a moment?

94
00:06:41,470 --> 00:06:43,437
You see? Those
weighted ribbons

95
00:06:43,505 --> 00:06:44,839
allow me to calculate
the strength

96
00:06:44,907 --> 00:06:46,374
<i>and direction</i>
<i>of the wind.</i>

97
00:06:46,441 --> 00:06:50,178
<i>In this case, I would say...</i>
<i>it's about 20 knots</i>

98
00:06:50,246 --> 00:06:52,214
and shifting...

99
00:06:52,282 --> 00:06:53,882
westerly.

100
00:06:53,950 --> 00:06:55,550
Ha ha ha!

101
00:06:55,618 --> 00:06:57,085
Yah!

102
00:06:57,153 --> 00:07:00,155
Wait, Maestro! What if your
calculations are wrong?

103
00:07:04,862 --> 00:07:09,199
<i>Wait, wait, Maestro! Oh,</i>
<i>Maestro, please, please stop!</i>

104
00:07:10,602 --> 00:07:13,270
<i>Oh, wait, Maestro.</i>
<i>Maestro!</i>

105
00:07:17,675 --> 00:07:19,976
Ha ha ha!
(Giggles)

106
00:07:27,419 --> 00:07:29,187
Oh, my God, please!

107
00:07:38,599 --> 00:07:39,933
Aaa-aaargh!

108
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,668
Yes!

109
00:07:41,736 --> 00:07:44,905
You're flying, Nico!

110
00:07:44,973 --> 00:07:46,941
Maestro-o-o!

111
00:07:47,576 --> 00:07:49,143
It's perfect!

112
00:07:52,782 --> 00:07:59,989
Uh. Uh.

113
00:08:00,057 --> 00:08:02,191
You're too high! Not so high.

114
00:08:02,259 --> 00:08:04,026
Nico!

115
00:08:37,426 --> 00:08:40,028
It works! It works, Maestro!

116
00:08:40,096 --> 00:08:42,931
I never had any doubts.
[ laughing ]

117
00:08:46,135 --> 00:08:48,103
(NICO) Oh, God,
I hate this place.

118
00:08:48,170 --> 00:08:50,805
What? Where else could we
practice our flights

119
00:08:50,873 --> 00:08:52,607
but in Florence?

120
00:08:52,675 --> 00:08:54,943
Anywhere else, we'd just be
burnt at the stake

121
00:08:55,010 --> 00:08:56,077
for our efforts.

122
00:08:57,413 --> 00:09:00,414
But here? I'm just another
free-thinking heretic.

123
00:09:00,482 --> 00:09:02,250
Chaos. Culture.

124
00:09:02,318 --> 00:09:04,585
It's all celebrated
within these walls.

125
00:09:04,653 --> 00:09:07,621
Florence only demands one
thing of its people.

126
00:09:07,689 --> 00:09:10,925
To be truly awake.

127
00:09:13,295 --> 00:09:15,796
Like that angelic vision.

128
00:09:15,864 --> 00:09:18,465
Don't even think about it.
That's Lucrezia Donati.

129
00:09:18,533 --> 00:09:21,735
Lorenzo de Medici's mistress.
I'm well aware of who she is.

130
00:09:21,802 --> 00:09:23,002
He'll break you on
the wheel,

131
00:09:23,070 --> 00:09:24,404
if he catches you
looking at her.

132
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:28,342
But what if she's caught
looking at me?

133
00:09:36,751 --> 00:09:38,719
Bad tidings
from Milan, Nico.

134
00:09:38,787 --> 00:09:40,454
How can you tell?

135
00:09:40,522 --> 00:09:43,424
That serpent on the rider's
surcoat is the Biscione,

136
00:09:43,492 --> 00:09:46,627
the Sforza family emblem.

137
00:09:46,695 --> 00:09:48,262
<i>If he was bringing good news,</i>
<i>he'd have been dressed</i>

138
00:09:48,330 --> 00:09:51,266
<i>in the more traditional red</i>
<i>and white shield of Milan.</i>

139
00:09:51,333 --> 00:09:52,700
Whatever the message is,

140
00:09:52,768 --> 00:09:54,602
Lorenzo won't be
happy with it.

141
00:10:14,223 --> 00:10:16,057
Out!

142
00:10:16,125 --> 00:10:19,461
Out! All of you!

143
00:10:19,528 --> 00:10:21,996
<i>Lorenzo? Lorenzo!</i>

144
00:10:23,532 --> 00:10:27,434
The Duke of Milan is dead.

145
00:10:27,502 --> 00:10:29,770
- Assassinated.
- By whose hand?

146
00:10:29,838 --> 00:10:33,507
- Visconti and two others.
- An honor killing, then.

147
00:10:33,575 --> 00:10:36,577
They say the Duke
deflowered his niece.

148
00:10:36,644 --> 00:10:39,280
Sforza was a pig
of epic appetites.

149
00:10:39,348 --> 00:10:42,350
Yes, but he was our pig!

150
00:10:42,418 --> 00:10:45,119
I sense the Vatican's hand
behind this.

151
00:10:45,187 --> 00:10:47,554
The timing is just
too perfect.

152
00:10:47,622 --> 00:10:50,991
If you're right, this upsets the
balance of power in Italy, Lorenzo.

153
00:10:51,058 --> 00:10:53,327
Oh, by God, Becchi,
this more than upsets.

154
00:10:53,394 --> 00:10:55,362
This all but decapitates
the concept

155
00:10:55,430 --> 00:10:57,564
and shits down
its throat!

156
00:11:02,637 --> 00:11:04,472
(Sighs)

157
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:06,707
We need to shore up public
support.

158
00:11:06,775 --> 00:11:08,776
Easter holiday is
nearly upon us.

159
00:11:08,844 --> 00:11:10,778
Let's throw a carnival.

160
00:11:10,846 --> 00:11:12,914
<i>Allow the people</i>
<i>of Florence to celebrate</i>

161
00:11:12,982 --> 00:11:14,849
<i>the end of Lent</i>
<i>as they do its arrival.</i>

162
00:11:14,917 --> 00:11:16,551
The more flamboyant
the pageantry,

163
00:11:16,619 --> 00:11:18,186
the stronger
we appear.

164
00:11:18,254 --> 00:11:21,156
We're not fucking peacocks,
Giuliano.

165
00:11:21,224 --> 00:11:22,724
Carnival is all
well and good,

166
00:11:22,792 --> 00:11:24,493
but if it has no teeth
behind it,

167
00:11:24,561 --> 00:11:27,095
we might as well slit
our own throats.

168
00:11:34,203 --> 00:11:36,972
Are you frightened?

169
00:11:37,039 --> 00:11:40,008
No, Most Holy Father.

170
00:11:40,076 --> 00:11:42,110
Lying is a sin,
my dear boy.

171
00:11:42,178 --> 00:11:44,380
It separates us
from God's grace.

172
00:11:48,018 --> 00:11:52,622
Yes, I'm frightened.

173
00:11:52,690 --> 00:11:56,059
But that's also a lie,
isn't it?

174
00:11:56,127 --> 00:11:59,163
At least, a partial one.

175
00:11:59,231 --> 00:12:02,299
A venial sin, perhaps.

176
00:12:02,367 --> 00:12:03,868
So...

177
00:12:03,935 --> 00:12:06,203
which statement
is correct?

178
00:12:06,271 --> 00:12:08,773
Hm?

179
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:10,708
Speak, child.

180
00:12:10,775 --> 00:12:13,344
Don't you want
to enter heaven?

181
00:12:15,647 --> 00:12:18,949
The proper answer
would be...

182
00:12:19,017 --> 00:12:20,851
(Door opens)

183
00:12:20,919 --> 00:12:24,188
(GUARD) Please! His Holiness
has forbidden any visitors.

184
00:12:24,256 --> 00:12:27,358
Our men succeeded,
Your Grace!

185
00:12:27,426 --> 00:12:30,762
Sforza is dead.

186
00:12:30,830 --> 00:12:34,699
Florence is ripe for
the picking, Your Eminence.

187
00:12:34,767 --> 00:12:36,367
Trust me.

188
00:12:36,435 --> 00:12:38,135
You know this how?

189
00:12:38,203 --> 00:12:40,605
Because I have an agent
within Lorenzo's ranks.

190
00:12:42,441 --> 00:12:45,109
The Medicis are
throwing a carnival,

191
00:12:45,177 --> 00:12:48,213
in a pathetic bid to win
the people's favor.

192
00:12:48,281 --> 00:12:51,383
They're weak,
Your Holiness.

193
00:12:51,451 --> 00:12:53,419
This is your chance
to strike.

194
00:12:53,487 --> 00:12:56,622
Not mine, Nephew.

195
00:12:56,690 --> 00:12:59,626
The Lord's.

196
00:12:59,694 --> 00:13:02,695
There is another reason
for haste.

197
00:13:02,763 --> 00:13:05,131
The Turk has arrived
in Florence.

198
00:13:05,199 --> 00:13:08,101
He's after
the Book of Leaves.

199
00:13:14,208 --> 00:13:17,210
I am truly sorry.

200
00:13:21,949 --> 00:13:23,817
Why?

201
00:13:23,885 --> 00:13:27,053
Because you can't
have heard this.

202
00:13:56,950 --> 00:13:59,918
(GIULIANO) Do you have
the plans for the colombina or not?

203
00:13:59,986 --> 00:14:01,921
(VERROCCHIO) We do.

204
00:14:01,988 --> 00:14:03,889
And they're breathtaking.

205
00:14:03,957 --> 00:14:05,591
Then produce
these miraculous renderings

206
00:14:05,658 --> 00:14:07,292
and let us
evaluate them.

207
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:09,027
Unfortunately...

208
00:14:09,095 --> 00:14:10,629
I can't.

209
00:14:10,696 --> 00:14:12,664
Because they
don't exist!

210
00:14:12,732 --> 00:14:14,666
By God, if you think
you can defraud

211
00:14:14,734 --> 00:14:15,901
the House
of Medici...

212
00:14:15,968 --> 00:14:19,338
No, no, no, they do exist,
I promise you!

213
00:14:19,405 --> 00:14:23,008
They're in this chest.

214
00:14:23,075 --> 00:14:24,876
- Open it.
- It's locked.

215
00:14:24,944 --> 00:14:27,579
Well, then, I'll take
my sword to it.

216
00:14:29,515 --> 00:14:31,483
The chest is rigged
to explode

217
00:14:31,551 --> 00:14:33,218
if anyone
tampers with it.

218
00:14:33,286 --> 00:14:35,120
Are you mad?

219
00:14:35,187 --> 00:14:38,357
Why would anyone engineer
such an infernal contrivance?

220
00:14:38,424 --> 00:14:42,795
To protect my ideas,
obviously.

221
00:14:42,862 --> 00:14:45,598
<i>Gentlemen, Leonardo Da Vinci.</i>

222
00:14:45,666 --> 00:14:48,168
<i>Ah, I've heard of you.</i>

223
00:14:48,235 --> 00:14:49,836
They say you're quite
the free-thinker.

224
00:14:49,904 --> 00:14:51,737
- You're late.
- Grape.

225
00:14:51,805 --> 00:14:54,774
So! The First Citizen
of Florence

226
00:14:54,842 --> 00:14:56,683
is desperate for us
to fashion him a colombina.

227
00:14:56,710 --> 00:14:58,311
'Desperate'
is a strong word.

228
00:14:58,378 --> 00:15:01,180
And yet it happens to be
the word I used.

229
00:15:01,248 --> 00:15:02,948
But let's review.

230
00:15:03,016 --> 00:15:05,584
Every Easter, a grand
procession makes its way

231
00:15:05,652 --> 00:15:07,620
through the streets
of Florence,

232
00:15:07,687 --> 00:15:09,355
terminating
at the cathedral.

233
00:15:09,422 --> 00:15:10,789
Why do you insist
on stating

234
00:15:10,857 --> 00:15:13,593
what every child
of three already knows?

235
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:15,862
Why do you insist on
interrupting me?

236
00:15:15,930 --> 00:15:17,831
I have a methodology.
We can follow it.

237
00:15:17,899 --> 00:15:19,066
Or we can flail about.

238
00:15:22,170 --> 00:15:24,838
I'll take your silence as a
vote for the former. Onward.

239
00:15:24,905 --> 00:15:26,840
At the culmination of mass,
a mechanical dove,

240
00:15:26,908 --> 00:15:29,176
the colombina, is flown
from the altar on a wire.

241
00:15:29,244 --> 00:15:32,045
Out into the public
square it soars.

242
00:15:32,113 --> 00:15:34,180
It ignites a cart full
of fireworks.

243
00:15:34,248 --> 00:15:36,616
<i>The Republic celebrates,</i>
<i>they don masks.</i>

244
00:15:36,684 --> 00:15:38,852
<i>They engage in drunken</i>
<i>revelry. Now...</i>

245
00:15:38,919 --> 00:15:42,122
For years, the House
of Medici has contracted

246
00:15:42,189 --> 00:15:46,726
with inferior workshops to
produce said ceremonial dove.

247
00:15:46,794 --> 00:15:48,628
But, this year,

248
00:15:48,696 --> 00:15:51,731
if I am to understand
the politics afoot,

249
00:15:51,799 --> 00:15:56,535
the same shoddy pageantry

250
00:15:56,603 --> 00:15:57,637
just won't do.

251
00:15:57,704 --> 00:15:59,539
No-one's carped about
our dove before.

252
00:15:59,607 --> 00:16:01,474
To call your previous
efforts 'a dove'

253
00:16:01,542 --> 00:16:03,743
is to insult
the entire avian class.

254
00:16:03,811 --> 00:16:06,679
Enough! Just show us
the damn thing.

255
00:16:06,747 --> 00:16:08,247
All right.

256
00:16:23,097 --> 00:16:24,697
Ho ho ho.

257
00:16:27,968 --> 00:16:29,936
That is but a quarter-scale
model.

258
00:16:30,004 --> 00:16:33,873
There.

259
00:16:33,941 --> 00:16:36,242
It's a thing of beauty,
I'll grant you that.

260
00:16:36,310 --> 00:16:38,478
Yes, and it can be yours
for 30 florins.

261
00:16:38,546 --> 00:16:40,380
- 30?
- Yeah.

262
00:16:40,448 --> 00:16:42,215
The contract stated 12.

263
00:16:42,283 --> 00:16:45,218
That was for a bird that
needed a guide wire.

264
00:16:45,286 --> 00:16:49,589
This miracle requires
no such handicap.

265
00:17:16,952 --> 00:17:19,987
Your work is impressive.

266
00:17:20,055 --> 00:17:21,222
But the price is too steep.

267
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:24,458
- 30 florins is a bargain.
- 30 florins is sodomy!

268
00:17:24,526 --> 00:17:26,761
Perhaps I should
be negotiating

269
00:17:26,829 --> 00:17:28,069
with your older
brother instead.

270
00:17:33,168 --> 00:17:35,202
(Chuckles)

271
00:17:35,270 --> 00:17:37,171
For God's sake, Becchi,

272
00:17:37,239 --> 00:17:40,275
just pay the degenerate
and be done with it.

273
00:17:42,945 --> 00:17:45,013
You win, artista.

274
00:17:46,248 --> 00:17:47,582
As is customary
with commissions,

275
00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:51,853
we shall pay half now
and half upon completion.

276
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:54,489
While we're on the subject
of commissions,

277
00:17:54,557 --> 00:17:58,960
I'm told that there's an open
one to paint Lucrezia Donati.

278
00:17:59,028 --> 00:18:02,130
Lorenzo's mistress.

279
00:18:02,198 --> 00:18:06,701
Stick to your whirligigs
and parlor tricks, Da Vinci.

280
00:18:06,769 --> 00:18:09,270
Take a lesson from Icarus.

281
00:18:18,114 --> 00:18:20,350
[ whisperings in his mind ]

282
00:18:47,777 --> 00:18:48,910
[ whispers stop ]

283
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:12,434
<i>(VANESSA) So, tell me...</i>

284
00:19:14,104 --> 00:19:16,271
<i>..is there nothing else</i>
<i>you fear?</i>

285
00:19:28,285 --> 00:19:30,353
Uh! Aah! Aah!

286
00:19:32,990 --> 00:19:35,058
Are you all right,
Leonardo?

287
00:19:38,428 --> 00:19:40,596
It was just a nightmare,
Andrea.

288
00:19:40,664 --> 00:19:42,798
You have them all too
frequently.

289
00:19:42,866 --> 00:19:46,569
I'm having some issues with
my mathematics, that's all.

290
00:19:46,637 --> 00:19:48,705
Issues?

291
00:19:48,772 --> 00:19:50,473
I'm not sure...

292
00:19:50,541 --> 00:19:53,409
that the colombina will be
flightworthy by Easter.

293
00:19:53,477 --> 00:19:55,444
- But the model...
- Was a model.

294
00:19:55,512 --> 00:19:57,680
Once I scale up
the dimensions,

295
00:19:57,747 --> 00:20:00,283
the calculations don't hold.
It's annoying!

296
00:20:02,486 --> 00:20:04,387
Smoking opium
won't help matters.

297
00:20:04,454 --> 00:20:06,422
- It clears my head.
- It clouds it.

298
00:20:06,490 --> 00:20:09,992
What are you, my nursemaid?
I think too much. All right?

299
00:20:10,060 --> 00:20:13,096
I need to dull my thoughts or
I'll be eviscerated by them.

300
00:20:13,163 --> 00:20:15,431
I would have thought
that you would have

301
00:20:15,499 --> 00:20:17,267
understood that by now!

302
00:20:20,504 --> 00:20:23,707
The tears of the poppy have
medicinal properties.

303
00:20:23,774 --> 00:20:28,111
- The priests in Egypt...
- We are not in Egypt.

304
00:20:28,179 --> 00:20:30,614
<i>And you are no priest.</i>

305
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:38,488
<i>You have a gift, Leo.</i>

306
00:20:38,556 --> 00:20:40,590
A kind of...genius...

307
00:20:40,658 --> 00:20:43,827
the likes of which
I've never seen.

308
00:20:43,895 --> 00:20:47,997
Because of that, people will
always seek to destroy you.

309
00:20:48,065 --> 00:20:50,966
Please...

310
00:20:51,034 --> 00:20:53,903
..don't aid them
in their endeavor.

311
00:21:25,735 --> 00:21:28,804
- How much for the starlings?
- Six denari apiece.

312
00:21:28,872 --> 00:21:31,073
I'll give you two soldi
for the lot.

313
00:21:31,141 --> 00:21:32,942
Are you trying
to offend me?

314
00:21:33,010 --> 00:21:34,377
No, if I was trying
to offend you,

315
00:21:34,444 --> 00:21:36,645
I'd comment on the scent
of fecal matter

316
00:21:36,713 --> 00:21:37,913
wafting from
your hindquarters.

317
00:21:37,981 --> 00:21:40,316
Do you want the soldi or not?

318
00:21:40,384 --> 00:21:42,985
They're my last,
I'm bored.

319
00:21:46,857 --> 00:21:48,825
No, I'm only interested
in the birds.

320
00:21:48,892 --> 00:21:51,127
Just open the cage
on my say-so.

321
00:21:51,195 --> 00:21:54,097
He's obsessed with flight. He
studies them for inspiration.

322
00:22:07,579 --> 00:22:08,646
Now.

323
00:23:01,468 --> 00:23:03,936
<i>Well? Did you see what you</i>
<i>were hoping to?</i>

324
00:23:04,004 --> 00:23:08,407
For one of my soldi back,
I just might tell you.

325
00:23:08,475 --> 00:23:11,410
All right.
Tell me.

326
00:23:11,478 --> 00:23:14,746
I saw an idiot who doesn't
know how to haggle.

327
00:23:14,814 --> 00:23:18,616
Look, Nico.
There she is again.

328
00:23:18,684 --> 00:23:20,752
<i>Look at her with Lorenzo.</i>

329
00:23:20,820 --> 00:23:23,654
Everyone pretending the two
of them aren't fucking.

330
00:23:23,722 --> 00:23:27,758
- Isn't that your father?
- Crown Prince of parasites.

331
00:23:27,826 --> 00:23:30,961
He serves as Lorenzo's
notary.

332
00:23:31,029 --> 00:23:33,798
Come on, Nico, let's
stir the pot a little.

333
00:23:33,866 --> 00:23:37,135
Your Magnificence!

334
00:23:37,202 --> 00:23:40,105
My name is Leonardo Da Vinci.
Perhaps you've heard of me?

335
00:23:40,172 --> 00:23:42,440
I am designing your
Easter colombina.

336
00:23:42,508 --> 00:23:44,542
Oh, yes.

337
00:23:44,610 --> 00:23:47,345
You're the eccentric
that Verrocchio employs.

338
00:23:47,413 --> 00:23:49,648
I'm an artist, yes,
and an anatomist

339
00:23:49,715 --> 00:23:51,082
and an engineer
of some note.

340
00:23:51,150 --> 00:23:53,485
'Extortionist' is the word
I recall using.

341
00:23:53,553 --> 00:23:55,554
I drive a stiff bargain,
it's true.

342
00:23:55,621 --> 00:23:57,322
But the fact is,
I have designed

343
00:23:57,390 --> 00:23:59,391
a more ambitious
series of devices

344
00:23:59,459 --> 00:24:01,494
that I know your
percipient mind

345
00:24:01,561 --> 00:24:02,762
will take an
interest in.

346
00:24:02,829 --> 00:24:04,997
Move along, vermin.

347
00:24:07,701 --> 00:24:09,535
Another time.

348
00:24:09,602 --> 00:24:12,171
Perhaps.

349
00:24:19,612 --> 00:24:22,614
I'm wounded, Nico.

350
00:24:22,682 --> 00:24:23,882
I need wine.

351
00:24:26,987 --> 00:24:28,921
(Pig squeals)

352
00:24:34,528 --> 00:24:36,829
How goes business,
Zoroaster?

353
00:24:36,897 --> 00:24:38,397
Execrable, since
the Duke's demise.

354
00:24:38,465 --> 00:24:40,233
These are dark times
for Florence.

355
00:24:40,300 --> 00:24:42,835
Case in point. Those mercenaries
flooding into town.

356
00:24:42,902 --> 00:24:44,636
If war does break out,

357
00:24:44,704 --> 00:24:46,138
they'll be the only ones
gainfully employed.

358
00:24:46,206 --> 00:24:48,240
Speaking of employment,

359
00:24:48,308 --> 00:24:50,809
a two-headed calf,
stillborn on Zitto's farm.

360
00:24:50,877 --> 00:24:52,344
I can procure it, if you like, for
your medical studies.

361
00:24:52,412 --> 00:24:53,842
The last corpse you
brought me was already

362
00:24:53,867 --> 00:24:55,614
decomposing by the time
I took a scalpel to it.

363
00:24:55,615 --> 00:24:57,049
Grave-robbing is like
fishmongering.

364
00:24:57,117 --> 00:24:59,318
You're at the mercy
of the day's catch.

365
00:24:59,386 --> 00:25:01,420
Come on. A boar sausage?

366
00:25:01,488 --> 00:25:03,923
You know damn well
that I am a vegetarian.

367
00:25:03,991 --> 00:25:06,892
- Keep hoping to corrupt you.
- Oh, I'm corruptible.

368
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:09,395
I just prefer not to eat
anything with eyes.

369
00:25:09,462 --> 00:25:12,131
- Potatoes have eyes.
- Fuck off, Nico!

370
00:25:12,199 --> 00:25:14,133
<i>Maestro!</i>

371
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:16,201
May I model for you again?

372
00:25:16,269 --> 00:25:18,237
No-one looks at
my form as you do.

373
00:25:18,305 --> 00:25:20,072
No-one looks at
any form as I do.

374
00:25:20,140 --> 00:25:21,607
Go peddle your wares
with Botticelli.

375
00:25:21,675 --> 00:25:22,808
He's an easy mark.

376
00:25:25,045 --> 00:25:27,280
Model? That boy's
nothing but a hustler

377
00:25:27,348 --> 00:25:28,948
and an artless
one at that.

378
00:25:29,016 --> 00:25:31,117
But pleasing to the eye,
nonetheless.

379
00:25:31,185 --> 00:25:32,986
Piss.

380
00:25:33,053 --> 00:25:35,354
Her. Have a gander
at these.

381
00:25:35,422 --> 00:25:37,490
My latest venture.

382
00:25:37,557 --> 00:25:39,558
They're called
tarot cards.

383
00:25:39,626 --> 00:25:43,296
They're used to divine
fortunes.

384
00:25:43,363 --> 00:25:45,683
Here. Pick one, Nico.

385
00:25:45,708 --> 00:25:47,565
We'll see if it squares
with your temperament.

386
00:25:47,801 --> 00:25:49,535
- Funny. It's a trick.
- Is it?

387
00:25:49,602 --> 00:25:52,204
Or am I simply channeling
the powers of The Ancients?

388
00:25:52,272 --> 00:25:54,307
How many women has that line
worked on, Zo?

389
00:25:54,374 --> 00:25:56,475
A respectable amount.
Thank you very much.

390
00:25:56,543 --> 00:25:58,577
And a goodly number
of gentlemen, as well.

391
00:25:58,645 --> 00:26:01,647
But a card can symbolize not
just one's temperament,

392
00:26:01,715 --> 00:26:04,284
but one's fate.

393
00:26:04,351 --> 00:26:06,486
Do you dare see yours?

394
00:26:13,927 --> 00:26:18,964
Tell me. Don't hold back.

395
00:26:19,031 --> 00:26:21,033
This one...

396
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:24,102
represents sacrifice.

397
00:26:24,170 --> 00:26:28,807
A suspension between life
and death and then perhaps...

398
00:26:28,874 --> 00:26:32,310
..a great awakening.

399
00:26:32,378 --> 00:26:35,380
I'm an idiot.

400
00:26:35,447 --> 00:26:38,249
Those mercenaries. Florence
has no army of its own.

401
00:26:38,317 --> 00:26:40,719
So they're here to sell
their muscle. Right?

402
00:26:40,786 --> 00:26:42,893
But what if there was a more
lucrative way

403
00:26:42,918 --> 00:26:44,856
to traffic in the
Republic's unease?

404
00:26:44,857 --> 00:26:46,958
- Like what?
- I should promote myself

405
00:26:47,026 --> 00:26:50,195
as a military engineer,
not a painter.

406
00:26:50,262 --> 00:26:52,964
War has always been
the handmaiden of progress.

407
00:26:53,032 --> 00:26:54,766
If I want to explore
my ideas,

408
00:26:54,834 --> 00:26:58,069
I just need to cloak them in
the guise of Florence's defense.

409
00:26:58,137 --> 00:27:02,273
Why are the officers of the
night bothering that man?

410
00:27:02,341 --> 00:27:05,576
He's a Turk, a heathen.
Isn't that reason enough?

411
00:27:09,515 --> 00:27:11,215
No.

412
00:27:11,283 --> 00:27:13,218
No, this isn't your fight,
Leo.

413
00:27:13,285 --> 00:27:15,687
When's that ever
stopped me?

414
00:27:18,658 --> 00:27:20,626
What seems to be
the trouble here?

415
00:27:20,694 --> 00:27:22,328
Go back to your sketchbook,
scribbler.

416
00:27:22,396 --> 00:27:25,197
This isn't your concern.

417
00:27:25,265 --> 00:27:27,833
You see, unfortunately, um...

418
00:27:27,901 --> 00:27:30,002
I have this character flaw

419
00:27:30,070 --> 00:27:35,708
that compels me to intervene
whenever stupidity rears its head, so...

420
00:27:35,776 --> 00:27:37,843
You see? Cos that was stupid.

421
00:27:37,911 --> 00:27:39,811
Cos your man's grip was
too loose

422
00:27:39,879 --> 00:27:41,847
and now he finds himself

423
00:27:41,914 --> 00:27:47,185
staring down this handsome
spada da filo.

424
00:27:47,253 --> 00:27:49,287
Even more stupidity.

425
00:27:49,355 --> 00:27:51,723
Cos if you'd just asked
around,

426
00:27:51,791 --> 00:27:54,192
anyone will tell you
that I'm ambidextrous

427
00:27:54,260 --> 00:27:57,329
and perfectly capable
of fighting two or...

428
00:28:00,099 --> 00:28:02,100
..even three men
simultaneously.

429
00:28:02,168 --> 00:28:04,102
Bully someone else,
Dragonetti.

430
00:28:09,142 --> 00:28:13,278
You've made a serious
miscalculation tonight, artista.

431
00:28:13,346 --> 00:28:15,380
It wouldn't be
the first time.

432
00:28:25,524 --> 00:28:28,226
- Are you all right, sir?
- I'm more than all right.

433
00:28:28,293 --> 00:28:33,864
I am a son of Earth
and Starry Heaven.

434
00:28:33,932 --> 00:28:36,768
I return to Constantinople
the day after tomorrow.

435
00:28:36,835 --> 00:28:40,772
But I am staying at the Inn
of the Black Swan.

436
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:43,175
Come see me
before I leave...

437
00:28:45,111 --> 00:28:47,113
..Maestro.

438
00:28:50,017 --> 00:28:51,985
A bit weird.

439
00:28:52,053 --> 00:28:56,223
What did he give you?

440
00:28:56,291 --> 00:28:58,392
A tip, I think.

441
00:28:59,461 --> 00:29:01,061
..it was her mother.

442
00:29:02,531 --> 00:29:04,932
The same arse,
very different faces

443
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:09,404
and, when I realized, I did
a little sip on her tit.

444
00:29:09,471 --> 00:29:12,740
Take him, Nico. Jesus. He'll
never make it home alone.

445
00:29:12,808 --> 00:29:14,475
Are you sure, Maestro?

446
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:16,586
It's after curfew and there are
bound to be rogues about.

447
00:29:16,645 --> 00:29:18,579
- Then I'll fit right in. Go!
- Listen, Leo.

448
00:29:18,647 --> 00:29:20,114
What?

449
00:29:20,182 --> 00:29:23,684
I didn't deal you the Hanged
Man. That was all you.

450
00:29:23,752 --> 00:29:27,321
It was an omen. It was just
like the two-headed calf.

451
00:29:27,389 --> 00:29:29,290
I don't believe in omens.

452
00:29:29,357 --> 00:29:31,625
No. No, this is you. Go.

453
00:29:31,693 --> 00:29:33,294
Go!

454
00:29:37,032 --> 00:29:38,633
(Sighs)

455
00:29:38,701 --> 00:29:40,902
(Church bell chimes the hour)

456
00:29:47,310 --> 00:29:50,246
I know it's you, Dragonetti.

457
00:29:50,314 --> 00:29:52,948
Did you not learn your lesson
earlier?

458
00:29:58,721 --> 00:30:00,122
Ah.

459
00:30:00,990 --> 00:30:04,560
I guess you did learn.

460
00:30:04,627 --> 00:30:07,463
(Gasps for breath)

461
00:30:10,033 --> 00:30:11,534
(DA VINCI'S FATHER)
That's enough.

462
00:30:13,637 --> 00:30:15,471
I should have known.

463
00:30:15,539 --> 00:30:17,707
People are talking about you.

464
00:30:17,774 --> 00:30:20,911
And not in
a positive light.

465
00:30:20,979 --> 00:30:23,847
I couldn't care less what
they're saying about me.

466
00:30:23,915 --> 00:30:27,084
I care!

467
00:30:27,152 --> 00:30:29,587
I'll not have you tarnishing
our family's name

468
00:30:29,655 --> 00:30:34,758
with your flippant tone and
your vulgar attempts at self-promotion.

469
00:30:34,826 --> 00:30:36,861
Perhaps you should
disown me, then.

470
00:30:36,928 --> 00:30:38,295
You're my first-born.

471
00:30:38,363 --> 00:30:41,231
And much as I may wish
to disavow you,

472
00:30:41,299 --> 00:30:43,501
our reputations
are intertwined.

473
00:30:43,568 --> 00:30:46,070
First-born?

474
00:30:47,272 --> 00:30:49,239
You say that as if...

475
00:30:49,307 --> 00:30:52,809
My wife, Margherita...

476
00:30:52,877 --> 00:30:58,081
..bore me a son
this past week.

477
00:30:58,148 --> 00:31:01,651
A legitimate heir.

478
00:31:01,719 --> 00:31:04,654
Well, my condolences to him.

479
00:31:04,722 --> 00:31:08,624
I wonder how long
it will take him to curse his lineage.

480
00:31:08,692 --> 00:31:10,590
As a bastard, your rank

481
00:31:10,615 --> 00:31:12,795
within the social order has
been rigidly defined.

482
00:31:12,797 --> 00:31:16,132
You should endeavor
to remain within it.

483
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:18,535
Stay away from the Medicis,
Leonardo.

484
00:31:18,602 --> 00:31:21,237
- I'll not warn you again.
- I'll wager you will.

485
00:31:21,305 --> 00:31:23,840
Why do you have to make
this so difficult?

486
00:31:23,908 --> 00:31:26,410
It's my nature!
I see things as they are,

487
00:31:26,477 --> 00:31:28,512
not as they might be.

488
00:31:33,651 --> 00:31:35,286
You...

489
00:31:35,353 --> 00:31:38,089
are a petty man.

490
00:31:41,694 --> 00:31:45,030
And...you will never
achieve greatness.

491
00:31:48,367 --> 00:31:50,368
Whereas I...

492
00:31:50,436 --> 00:31:53,571
I already have.

493
00:31:58,444 --> 00:32:01,679
You're kneeling
in a dungeon.

494
00:32:01,747 --> 00:32:04,683
About to be hit again
and again.

495
00:32:04,750 --> 00:32:09,354
By men who know
how to hit.

496
00:32:09,422 --> 00:32:13,058
That's what you've achieved,
Leonardo.

497
00:32:22,836 --> 00:32:25,204
Beat him for another hour,

498
00:32:25,271 --> 00:32:27,272
then toss him back
onto the street

499
00:32:27,340 --> 00:32:29,742
with the rest
of the garbage.

500
00:32:33,046 --> 00:32:34,680
Hold out the scribbler's
hand.

501
00:32:39,285 --> 00:32:43,788
(Howls)

502
00:32:43,856 --> 00:32:46,790
To be fair, you actually look
more wretched than I, so...

503
00:32:46,858 --> 00:32:49,326
well done.

504
00:32:49,394 --> 00:32:51,562
Perhaps you should see
a physician.

505
00:32:51,629 --> 00:32:53,096
I'm fine.

506
00:32:53,164 --> 00:32:56,466
Oh, they're executing
a Jew today.

507
00:32:56,534 --> 00:32:58,669
Apparently, they caught him breaking into
the book shop on the Via Dei Librai.

508
00:32:58,736 --> 00:33:00,637
It should be good sport.

509
00:33:00,705 --> 00:33:03,640
I'm not sure a man's death
should be characterized as sport.

510
00:33:03,708 --> 00:33:05,792
This fucking spot is too sunny.

511
00:33:05,817 --> 00:33:06,909
Can't we move over
into the shade?

512
00:33:06,910 --> 00:33:08,711
- No.
- Why?

513
00:33:08,779 --> 00:33:11,214
Because every morning,
at precisely this time,

514
00:33:11,282 --> 00:33:14,617
Lucrezia Donati comes to this
exact spot to purchase...

515
00:33:14,685 --> 00:33:16,285
flowers.

516
00:33:16,353 --> 00:33:19,022
<i>There.</i>

517
00:33:22,660 --> 00:33:27,063
She's appealing, I'll grant
you that, but...

518
00:33:27,131 --> 00:33:29,999
..I'd rather bed that old
toothless hag over there.

519
00:33:30,067 --> 00:33:33,102
Now you're just being
contrary.

520
00:33:33,170 --> 00:33:35,572
It takes no great skill
to fuck a pretty face.

521
00:33:35,639 --> 00:33:38,741
But a truly ugly woman, that
actually requires discipline

522
00:33:38,809 --> 00:33:40,529
and, let me tell you,
my friend, done right,

523
00:33:40,544 --> 00:33:42,611
a transcendent
experience.

524
00:33:57,594 --> 00:33:59,662
(Winces)

525
00:34:05,703 --> 00:34:08,671
Nico, run this over to her.

526
00:34:08,739 --> 00:34:10,740
Make sure she knows
where it's come from.

527
00:34:12,977 --> 00:34:15,245
What the devil
are you up to, Leo?

528
00:34:38,135 --> 00:34:40,203
She wants to speak
with you.

529
00:34:40,270 --> 00:34:42,505
Uh-huh? Well,
tell her I'm busy.

530
00:34:42,573 --> 00:34:44,341
You're seriously
not turning her down?

531
00:34:44,408 --> 00:34:47,444
Tell her, Nico.
Timing is all.

532
00:34:51,216 --> 00:34:53,017
He can't right now.

533
00:34:56,255 --> 00:34:59,725
(MAN) Behold, a criminal
in our midst!

534
00:34:59,792 --> 00:35:01,827
A Jew, no less!

535
00:35:01,894 --> 00:35:06,098
<i>Watch him dance!</i>
<i>Watch him dangle!</i>

536
00:35:06,166 --> 00:35:08,334
<i>Bring your fruit</i>
<i>and small stones!</i>

537
00:35:08,402 --> 00:35:10,937
<i>God protect the Republic</i>
<i>of Florence!</i>

538
00:35:11,004 --> 00:35:12,738
(Cheering)

539
00:35:16,910 --> 00:35:19,245
I am a son of Earth
and Starry Heaven.

540
00:35:21,748 --> 00:35:23,548
I am thirsty.

541
00:35:23,616 --> 00:35:25,584
Please, give me
something to drink

542
00:35:25,651 --> 00:35:27,385
from the Fountain
of Memory.

543
00:35:30,590 --> 00:35:32,524
(Cheering)

544
00:35:32,591 --> 00:35:34,559
(Crowd applauds)

545
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,602
<i>Are you all right, Maestro?</i>

546
00:35:46,672 --> 00:35:48,373
I need to leave.

547
00:35:54,747 --> 00:35:58,016
Is there a foreigner staying
here, a Turkish man?

548
00:35:58,083 --> 00:36:00,018
He said you could find him
at the Roman ruins,

549
00:36:00,086 --> 00:36:01,653
north of town.

550
00:36:46,835 --> 00:36:48,903
Will you smoke with me,
Da Vinci?

551
00:36:48,970 --> 00:36:51,706
Well, that depends
on what's in the pipe.

552
00:37:06,088 --> 00:37:09,057
History is a lie that has
been honed like a weapon

553
00:37:09,124 --> 00:37:11,859
by people who have
suppressed the truth.

554
00:37:11,926 --> 00:37:13,894
Centuries from now,
your own history

555
00:37:13,962 --> 00:37:16,697
will also be suppressed.

556
00:37:16,765 --> 00:37:18,899
How could you possibly
know that?

557
00:37:18,967 --> 00:37:22,236
You have heard the phrase
'Time is a river'?

558
00:37:22,304 --> 00:37:24,305
What most fail to grasp

559
00:37:24,373 --> 00:37:26,974
is that the river
is circular.

560
00:37:27,042 --> 00:37:28,810
<i>One man's death...</i>

561
00:37:28,877 --> 00:37:31,646
<i>opens a doorway</i>
<i>to the birth of the next.</i>

562
00:37:33,081 --> 00:37:36,049
I saw a man
executed today.

563
00:37:36,117 --> 00:37:37,084
He said something to me.

564
00:37:37,151 --> 00:37:39,319
- I am...
- A son of Earth

565
00:37:39,387 --> 00:37:41,355
and Starry Heaven.

566
00:37:41,423 --> 00:37:43,391
I am thirsty.

567
00:37:43,459 --> 00:37:45,727
Please, give me
something to drink

568
00:37:45,795 --> 00:37:48,263
from the Fountain
of Memory.

569
00:37:49,699 --> 00:37:51,132
It is an invocation.

570
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:52,601
A way for members
of our fraternity

571
00:37:52,668 --> 00:37:53,768
to recognize one another.

572
00:37:53,836 --> 00:37:55,871
I'm not a member
of your fraternity.

573
00:37:55,938 --> 00:37:57,339
Are you sure?

574
00:38:00,043 --> 00:38:02,978
This temple was once
a place of worship

575
00:38:03,046 --> 00:38:05,146
for a religion
that originated

576
00:38:05,214 --> 00:38:08,149
long before Christ.

577
00:38:08,217 --> 00:38:11,252
We are known
as the Sons of Mithras.

578
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:13,120
Much of what you call
'progress'

579
00:38:13,188 --> 00:38:15,489
has simply been a matter
of remembering

580
00:38:15,557 --> 00:38:17,325
what was once forgotten.

581
00:38:17,392 --> 00:38:19,360
This knowledge
was set down

582
00:38:19,428 --> 00:38:23,398
in a compendium known
as the Book of Leaves.

583
00:38:23,466 --> 00:38:25,867
Recently, certain
clues have surfaced

584
00:38:25,935 --> 00:38:28,203
regarding the Book's
location.

585
00:38:28,271 --> 00:38:31,039
Avraham ben Yosef was
following those clues

586
00:38:31,107 --> 00:38:35,210
when he was apprehended
and put to death.

587
00:38:35,278 --> 00:38:38,213
<i>Perhaps you have heard</i>
<i>of the Secret Archives</i>

588
00:38:38,281 --> 00:38:40,849
the Vatican has assembled?

589
00:38:40,917 --> 00:38:45,086
Its curator is a man
called Lupo Mercuri.

590
00:38:45,154 --> 00:38:47,122
A fallen son of Mithras.

591
00:38:47,190 --> 00:38:52,160
Where we seek to disseminate
and preserve knowledge.

592
00:38:52,228 --> 00:38:54,830
They seek to alter
and suppress it.

593
00:38:54,897 --> 00:38:56,832
I still don't understand

594
00:38:56,900 --> 00:39:00,035
what any of this
has to do with me.

595
00:39:00,103 --> 00:39:03,172
What do you know...
about your mother?

596
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:05,674
Almost nothing.

597
00:39:06,409 --> 00:39:08,444
She... She disappeared.

598
00:39:08,511 --> 00:39:13,615
- She was a servant girl.
- She was a slave.

599
00:39:13,683 --> 00:39:17,452
Taken from Constantinople
against her will.

600
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:19,121
Do you remember...

601
00:39:19,188 --> 00:39:22,625
an incident that occurred
in your childhood?

602
00:39:26,362 --> 00:39:27,963
You have suppressed it.

603
00:39:33,370 --> 00:39:35,971
I was a boy in Vinci.

604
00:39:38,375 --> 00:39:42,378
<i>I'd been sent to fetch some</i>
<i>sheep that had wandered off.</i>

605
00:39:42,446 --> 00:39:44,480
I found a cave.

606
00:39:47,184 --> 00:39:48,985
I was scared to go inside,
but...

607
00:39:50,587 --> 00:39:52,955
But I was curious.

608
00:39:54,558 --> 00:39:56,426
So I ventured in.

609
00:39:58,028 --> 00:40:03,299
The next hours...are blank.

610
00:40:03,367 --> 00:40:07,236
I remember...

611
00:40:07,304 --> 00:40:10,940
..stumbling out.

612
00:40:11,007 --> 00:40:13,309
My hands and face...

613
00:40:16,212 --> 00:40:18,180
..were covered in blood.

614
00:40:18,248 --> 00:40:20,216
And somehow...

615
00:40:20,283 --> 00:40:23,286
I knew it wasn't my own.

616
00:40:26,924 --> 00:40:28,725
One day...

617
00:40:28,792 --> 00:40:32,395
you will sip from
the Fountain of Memory...

618
00:40:32,462 --> 00:40:37,266
..and learn more of what
occurred in that cave.

619
00:40:37,334 --> 00:40:39,569
When that day comes,
we will meet again.

620
00:40:39,636 --> 00:40:42,571
What do I do till then?

621
00:40:42,639 --> 00:40:44,807
Search for
the Book of Leaves.

622
00:40:44,875 --> 00:40:48,677
Fate has chosen you,
Leonardo.

623
00:40:48,745 --> 00:40:53,416
- I don't believe in fate.
- Then believe in yourself.

624
00:40:53,484 --> 00:40:55,851
Well, where do I start
my search, then?

625
00:40:55,919 --> 00:41:00,423
With the hanged man,
the seat of the soul.

626
00:41:00,490 --> 00:41:02,759
He's already opened
the door for you.

627
00:41:02,826 --> 00:41:05,795
And my mother?

628
00:41:05,863 --> 00:41:10,401
She will be for you
on the other side.

629
00:41:12,437 --> 00:41:14,404
All you have to do...

630
00:41:14,472 --> 00:41:17,040
is enter.

631
00:41:26,650 --> 00:41:28,985
(NICO) Maestro? Maestro?
Can you hear me?

632
00:41:29,053 --> 00:41:32,155
Maestro!

633
00:41:32,223 --> 00:41:34,658
We've been looking for you
since last night. What happened?

634
00:41:40,230 --> 00:41:42,064
The Turk was here.

635
00:41:45,602 --> 00:41:49,004
There was...
There was a statue.

636
00:41:49,072 --> 00:41:50,673
An altar.

637
00:41:50,740 --> 00:41:52,708
Must have weighed a ton.

638
00:41:52,776 --> 00:41:55,377
This place has been empty
for centuries, Leo.

639
00:41:55,445 --> 00:41:57,212
<i>Maestro, the Officers</i>
<i>of the Night</i>

640
00:41:57,280 --> 00:41:58,514
<i>have been searching</i>
<i>for you.</i>

641
00:41:58,581 --> 00:42:01,250
They say Lorenzo Medici
himself has asked for you.

642
00:42:43,060 --> 00:42:45,061
Leonardo di ser Piero...

643
00:42:45,128 --> 00:42:46,829
Da Vinci.

644
00:42:48,365 --> 00:42:51,768
I am told you are
my notary's bastard son.

645
00:42:53,637 --> 00:42:55,037
I am.

646
00:42:55,105 --> 00:42:57,440
<i>I'm also told that you are</i>
<i>a troublemaker,</i>

647
00:42:57,508 --> 00:43:00,543
<i>you are arrogant,</i>
<i>impolitic...</i>

648
00:43:00,611 --> 00:43:01,811
<i>..and utterly</i>
<i>incapable</i>

649
00:43:01,879 --> 00:43:04,113
<i>of keeping your opinions</i>
<i>to yourself.</i>

650
00:43:04,181 --> 00:43:08,351
Arrogance implies that
I exaggerate my own worth.

651
00:43:08,419 --> 00:43:09,920
<i>I don't.</i>

652
00:43:13,057 --> 00:43:16,060
My mistress, Lucrezia,

653
00:43:16,128 --> 00:43:17,629
seems to think that you have

654
00:43:17,696 --> 00:43:20,465
a singular talent
for portraiture.

655
00:43:20,533 --> 00:43:24,503
She insisted that you and
none other be the one to...

656
00:43:24,571 --> 00:43:26,672
capture her beauty.

657
00:43:26,739 --> 00:43:28,840
I'd say she has
a discerning eye, then.

658
00:43:28,908 --> 00:43:31,343
A warning, sir.
The man has a reputation

659
00:43:31,411 --> 00:43:34,346
for taking many commissions,
but finishing few.

660
00:43:34,414 --> 00:43:38,050
I wrestle with details.
I bore easily.

661
00:43:38,117 --> 00:43:40,118
Call it a character flaw.

662
00:43:40,186 --> 00:43:42,821
Well, with this commission,

663
00:43:42,889 --> 00:43:44,356
you'd be wise
to overcome it.

664
00:43:44,424 --> 00:43:46,725
When it comes
to Miss Donati,

665
00:43:46,793 --> 00:43:49,895
boredom is the last thing
I fear.

666
00:43:54,067 --> 00:43:56,468
I'll have your father draw up
a contract then.

667
00:43:56,536 --> 00:43:59,304
Sir, if I may, I have
a few other designs...

668
00:44:03,310 --> 00:44:04,710
(Winces)

669
00:44:04,778 --> 00:44:06,041
I have some designs

670
00:44:06,066 --> 00:44:08,237
that I think you might be
interested in.

671
00:44:09,249 --> 00:44:12,685
This will greatly increase
your gunner's rate of firepower.

672
00:44:12,753 --> 00:44:14,754
So, while the top rack's
being fired,

673
00:44:14,822 --> 00:44:16,923
the rack below that one
can be loaded

674
00:44:16,990 --> 00:44:19,525
and the rack below that one
is allowed to cool.

675
00:44:19,593 --> 00:44:21,961
The cannons are arranged
in a fan, which -

676
00:44:22,029 --> 00:44:24,697
- That will be enough.
- This is an armored cart.

677
00:44:24,765 --> 00:44:28,067
Propulsion is achieved by two
men, who are housed within.

678
00:44:28,135 --> 00:44:30,704
They operate cranks, which
rotate the wheels.

679
00:44:30,772 --> 00:44:33,207
Cannons can be mounted around
the perimeter of the cart.

680
00:44:44,887 --> 00:44:46,988
It's a flying machine.

681
00:44:47,056 --> 00:44:49,090
It's modeled after the
articulated wings of a bat.

682
00:44:49,158 --> 00:44:51,125
Madness.
If man were meant to fly...

683
00:44:51,193 --> 00:44:53,261
He would have been born
with wings, yes.

684
00:44:53,328 --> 00:44:54,896
But a similar assertion could
have been made prior

685
00:44:54,963 --> 00:44:56,163
to the invention
of gunpowder--

686
00:44:56,198 --> 00:45:00,835
or any other invention
conceived since fire.

687
00:45:00,902 --> 00:45:03,904
I believe man will fly
and I base this assumption

688
00:45:03,972 --> 00:45:05,705
on the fact that God
has blessed us

689
00:45:05,773 --> 00:45:08,642
with minds that are
capable of imagining it.

690
00:45:08,709 --> 00:45:12,647
Anything that can be dreamt
of will eventually be built.

691
00:45:13,815 --> 00:45:17,151
Anyone who says
otherwise is a fool.

692
00:45:18,554 --> 00:45:20,956
What exactly do you propose?

693
00:45:21,023 --> 00:45:23,158
I wish to be employed...

694
00:45:23,226 --> 00:45:26,461
as a military engineer.

695
00:45:26,529 --> 00:45:28,496
I am a humanist,
Da Vinci.

696
00:45:28,564 --> 00:45:30,965
I have no interest
in waging war.

697
00:45:31,033 --> 00:45:34,236
And yet your humanism
is precisely why war will happen.

698
00:45:34,304 --> 00:45:36,272
Florence has
no standing army.

699
00:45:36,340 --> 00:45:38,307
Nor does Rome.

700
00:45:38,375 --> 00:45:40,277
Necessarily...

701
00:45:40,345 --> 00:45:43,113
you've both made alliances
with states that do.

702
00:45:43,180 --> 00:45:45,148
Florence with Milan,

703
00:45:45,216 --> 00:45:48,318
and Rome with Naples.

704
00:45:48,386 --> 00:45:51,788
Sforza's death has up-ended
the game board.

705
00:45:51,856 --> 00:45:54,458
You need weapons of your own,
Your Magnificence.

706
00:45:59,663 --> 00:46:03,532
I will give you
a modest stipend.

707
00:46:03,600 --> 00:46:05,567
To see whether these...

708
00:46:05,635 --> 00:46:09,004
contraptions of yours
can actually be realized.

709
00:46:09,072 --> 00:46:11,507
- Shall we say 100 florins?
- 50.

710
00:46:11,575 --> 00:46:14,343
If you haggle any further,
I'll cut out your tongue.

711
00:46:14,411 --> 00:46:16,645
<i>As you say, sir.</i>

712
00:46:16,713 --> 00:46:18,581
Thank you.

713
00:46:18,649 --> 00:46:22,152
You used Lucrezia to gain
access to me, didn't you?

714
00:46:22,219 --> 00:46:24,288
I utilize any device
at my disposal,

715
00:46:24,355 --> 00:46:26,323
in order to realize
my goals.

716
00:46:26,391 --> 00:46:28,058
Clever,

717
00:46:28,126 --> 00:46:30,794
but I'd caution you not to be
too clever around me.

718
00:46:30,862 --> 00:46:32,863
Clockwork loses
its luster,

719
00:46:32,930 --> 00:46:38,034
once one glimpses the gears
beneath its face.

720
00:46:38,102 --> 00:46:39,436
Point taken.

721
00:46:55,253 --> 00:46:57,220
Is there a problem?

722
00:46:57,288 --> 00:46:59,289
None at all, sir.

723
00:46:59,357 --> 00:47:01,725
Good day.

724
00:47:12,003 --> 00:47:15,539
- Congratulations, Leonardo.
- Word travels fast.

725
00:47:15,607 --> 00:47:17,508
Ah, there are no secrets
in Florence.

726
00:47:17,575 --> 00:47:19,443
<i>How the devil</i>
<i>did you do it?</i>

727
00:47:19,510 --> 00:47:21,211
Oh, he played on
a woman's vanity.

728
00:47:21,279 --> 00:47:23,680
Your stratagem has become
clear, you bastard.

729
00:47:23,748 --> 00:47:26,416
A bastard of
the highest order.

730
00:47:26,484 --> 00:47:28,518
Ha! Drink up everybody.

731
00:47:28,586 --> 00:47:33,390
Then get back to work. We've
got a colombina to build!

732
00:47:33,458 --> 00:47:35,659
The Jew that was hanged, I want
you to unearth his body.

733
00:47:35,660 --> 00:47:37,060
I need to examine it.

734
00:47:37,128 --> 00:47:38,929
And my compensation?

735
00:47:38,997 --> 00:47:41,364
Well, that depends
how fresh the corpse is.

736
00:47:41,432 --> 00:47:43,367
Ah, well, then,
I'd best get digging.

737
00:48:33,315 --> 00:48:36,150
Ah, here's the Pazzi clan.

738
00:48:36,218 --> 00:48:39,187
With their schemer Francesco
and old man Jacopo.

739
00:48:39,254 --> 00:48:41,855
<i>Probably the oldest family</i>
<i>in Florence,</i>

740
00:48:41,923 --> 00:48:44,224
<i>definitely the most ornery.</i>

741
00:48:50,364 --> 00:48:52,165
(Bellows)

742
00:48:52,233 --> 00:48:56,736
The Pazzi family entrusts
Lorenzo de Medici

743
00:48:56,804 --> 00:48:58,772
with this new fire,

744
00:48:58,839 --> 00:49:02,909
struck on stones from the
Church of the Holy Sepulcher.

745
00:49:02,977 --> 00:49:04,978
As is our right.

746
00:49:05,046 --> 00:49:07,014
Granted to our ancestor
for his actions

747
00:49:07,081 --> 00:49:08,582
during the First Crusade.

748
00:49:14,555 --> 00:49:16,656
(Cheering)

749
00:49:27,701 --> 00:49:30,269
<i>(VERROCCHIO) The colombina</i>
<i>is about to fly.</i>

750
00:49:37,644 --> 00:49:41,947
<i>(LORENZO) Welcome, all</i>
<i>of you, into God's home.</i>

751
00:49:51,558 --> 00:49:53,859
(Crowd gasps)

752
00:50:43,712 --> 00:50:45,747
(Cheering)

753
00:51:16,243 --> 00:51:20,213
<i>(DA VINCI) The flames of</i>
<i>the phoenix suit you well.</i>

754
00:51:20,280 --> 00:51:21,881
Tell me, truly,

755
00:51:21,949 --> 00:51:25,751
are you always this wistful
with the whores you bed?

756
00:51:25,819 --> 00:51:28,221
Oh, you are no whore,
Signora.

757
00:51:29,590 --> 00:51:32,992
We need not continue
this pretence any longer, Miss Donati.

758
00:51:33,060 --> 00:51:36,062
I knew it was you from the
moment you approached me.

759
00:51:36,129 --> 00:51:38,097
How did you know?

760
00:51:38,165 --> 00:51:41,067
- I sketched you.
- (Giggles)

761
00:51:42,536 --> 00:51:46,539
Your features, your form,
your bearing.

762
00:51:46,607 --> 00:51:49,743
The more salient question...

763
00:51:49,810 --> 00:51:53,279
..is why would a noblewoman

764
00:51:53,347 --> 00:51:56,482
risk her reputation
on a lowly artisan?

765
00:51:58,753 --> 00:52:02,189
Well, isn't that the point
of a carnival?

766
00:52:02,256 --> 00:52:05,258
To pretend, for a night, that
you're someone you're not.

767
00:52:05,325 --> 00:52:07,794
No, I think there's more
to it than that, yeah.

768
00:52:07,861 --> 00:52:09,128
Tell me, then.

769
00:52:11,132 --> 00:52:13,099
You were intrigued
by my sketch.

770
00:52:13,167 --> 00:52:14,768
Yeah, so...

771
00:52:16,738 --> 00:52:20,441
You felt that it captured
an aspect of yourself

772
00:52:20,509 --> 00:52:23,578
that remains hidden
from your husband,

773
00:52:23,646 --> 00:52:26,181
and from your lover,
Lorenzo.

774
00:52:28,851 --> 00:52:32,787
The only time
you see this aspect...

775
00:52:32,855 --> 00:52:33,888
..is on the
rare occasions

776
00:52:33,956 --> 00:52:35,290
that you glimpse yourself
in the mirror,

777
00:52:35,357 --> 00:52:39,461
and you find a stranger
staring back at you.

778
00:52:42,599 --> 00:52:44,333
You knew I'd seek you out,
then.

779
00:52:46,003 --> 00:52:48,504
Well...

780
00:52:48,572 --> 00:52:51,674
Hey, I try to work out
what motivates people

781
00:52:51,742 --> 00:52:54,978
and then I proceed
accordingly.

782
00:52:55,045 --> 00:52:56,045
You manipulate them.

783
00:52:56,113 --> 00:52:57,480
No. I prefer to think
of it as gently

784
00:52:57,548 --> 00:52:59,082
redirecting
their trajectories.

785
00:53:18,603 --> 00:53:22,006
<i>Lorenzo was quite taken with</i>
<i>your designs.</i>

786
00:53:22,074 --> 00:53:24,476
<i>Well, may I see</i>
<i>one of these marvels?</i>

787
00:53:38,425 --> 00:53:40,392
What is it?

788
00:53:40,460 --> 00:53:42,961
It's a device for slowing
one's rate of descent.

789
00:53:43,029 --> 00:53:44,662
- Oh.
- Yeah.

790
00:53:44,730 --> 00:53:48,133
And under what circumstances
would I possibly have use for this?

791
00:53:50,402 --> 00:53:52,803
Say that you were trapped
in a fortress.

792
00:53:52,871 --> 00:53:56,807
- A fortress?
- That had been breached.

793
00:53:56,875 --> 00:53:59,376
You could strap yourself
into this...

794
00:53:59,444 --> 00:54:01,912
and you'd safely float down
to freedom.

795
00:54:01,980 --> 00:54:03,580
Oh, thank goodness.

796
00:54:07,452 --> 00:54:10,554
It would appear Lorenzo's
interest in you was justified.

797
00:54:10,622 --> 00:54:13,157
But tell me.

798
00:54:13,224 --> 00:54:17,061
I have risked my reputation
by sleeping with you.

799
00:54:17,129 --> 00:54:19,030
You've risked more.

800
00:54:19,098 --> 00:54:22,166
Perhaps even death.

801
00:54:22,234 --> 00:54:25,504
And to what do you ascribe
my reckless behavior, then?

802
00:54:25,572 --> 00:54:26,739
Love.

803
00:54:26,806 --> 00:54:28,474
Don't be absurd.

804
00:54:28,541 --> 00:54:30,843
You saw me, you drew me,
you fell in love.

805
00:54:30,911 --> 00:54:32,711
It's as simple as that.

806
00:54:32,779 --> 00:54:35,647
Add in the fact that I am
forbidden fruit...

807
00:54:37,449 --> 00:54:39,950
..and your fate was sealed.

808
00:54:44,289 --> 00:54:47,157
You're the third person this
week to lecture me on fate.

809
00:54:47,225 --> 00:54:50,761
Well, perhaps it's time
you started listening.

810
00:54:50,829 --> 00:54:52,663
Now...

811
00:54:58,003 --> 00:55:01,106
Fuck me again,
Leonardo.

812
00:55:01,173 --> 00:55:05,177
This time, remember...

813
00:55:07,313 --> 00:55:10,315
..you're not the only one
capable of manipulation.

814
00:55:22,895 --> 00:55:24,596
The Secret Archives are open

815
00:55:24,664 --> 00:55:28,834
only to his Holiness'
closest advisors.

816
00:55:28,901 --> 00:55:30,135
For obvious reasons,

817
00:55:30,160 --> 00:55:32,810
we can't have you parading
through the front door.

818
00:55:33,406 --> 00:55:36,008
Ah.

819
00:55:36,076 --> 00:55:39,879
How rude of me.

820
00:55:39,946 --> 00:55:42,982
I promised you
your payment first.

821
00:55:49,723 --> 00:55:52,624
I take it you're satisfied?

822
00:56:17,218 --> 00:56:19,186
Your Eminence,

823
00:56:19,254 --> 00:56:21,254
I bring news from Florence.

824
00:56:21,322 --> 00:56:23,290
Get on with it, then.

825
00:56:23,358 --> 00:56:26,359
A new player
has entered the stage.

826
00:56:26,427 --> 00:56:30,296
An artist known as
Leonardo Da Vinci.

827
00:56:30,364 --> 00:56:34,467
The Medicis have employed him
to design siege weapons.

828
00:56:34,535 --> 00:56:38,004
Artists are as common
as court jesters.

829
00:56:38,072 --> 00:56:41,708
I see no reason why this news
should concern us.

830
00:56:41,775 --> 00:56:45,378
This artist is different.
His ideas are...

831
00:56:45,446 --> 00:56:46,412
unusual,

832
00:56:46,480 --> 00:56:48,448
revolutionary.

833
00:56:48,515 --> 00:56:51,518
My agent in Florence.

834
00:56:58,659 --> 00:57:01,361
You trust your intelligence
to a woman?

835
00:57:01,429 --> 00:57:03,729
When one seeks
to convey a message,

836
00:57:03,797 --> 00:57:07,600
I prefer to use vessels
others would readily dismiss.

837
00:57:07,668 --> 00:57:10,637
If I am not mistaken,
you are Lupo Mercuri,

838
00:57:10,704 --> 00:57:12,372
Curator of the
Secret Archives.

839
00:57:12,439 --> 00:57:14,541
- What of it?
- It may interest you to know

840
00:57:14,608 --> 00:57:16,743
that Da Vinci has made
contact...

841
00:57:16,810 --> 00:57:18,911
with the Turk.

842
00:57:18,979 --> 00:57:23,182
He's searching for something
called the Book of Leaves.

843
00:57:24,785 --> 00:57:27,988
It would appear the Turk has
found a new champion.

844
00:57:30,491 --> 00:57:32,492
Continue watching him.

845
00:57:32,560 --> 00:57:34,594
See if he can be co-opted.

846
00:57:34,662 --> 00:57:37,363
And if he can't?

847
00:57:37,431 --> 00:57:39,398
Then Da Vinci
will be consumed

848
00:57:39,466 --> 00:57:42,469
in the fiery
sorrows of hell.

849
00:57:42,536 --> 00:57:46,006
Along with the rest
of God's enemies.
