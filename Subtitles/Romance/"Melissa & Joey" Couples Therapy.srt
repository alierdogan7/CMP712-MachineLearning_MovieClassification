<i>"Melissa and Joey" is recorded in
front of a live studio audience.</i>

2
00:00:03,618 --> 00:00:05,569
Charlotte, I really
appreciate your honesty.

3
00:00:05,603 --> 00:00:06,736
You're a good friend.

4
00:00:06,770 --> 00:00:09,539
Honest. Okay, talk later.

5
00:00:09,574 --> 00:00:10,624
Bye.

6
00:00:10,658 --> 00:00:13,610
Well, I'm never seeing that bitch again.

7
00:00:13,628 --> 00:00:15,462
You just said you appreciated her honesty.

8
00:00:15,496 --> 00:00:18,548
Obviously I was lying.

9
00:00:18,583 --> 00:00:21,751
How I feel and what I
say isn't always related.

10
00:00:21,785 --> 00:00:23,503
That's good to know.

11
00:00:23,554 --> 00:00:25,589
I just called to confirm
our dinner for this weekend

12
00:00:25,623 --> 00:00:26,673
and she said, get this...

13
00:00:26,829 --> 00:00:27,896
That she's not sure

14
00:00:28,006 --> 00:00:30,007
they're going to be hungry that night.

15
00:00:30,041 --> 00:00:31,525
Okay, if she's going to blow us off,

16
00:00:31,559 --> 00:00:33,475
she'd better put a little
more effort into it than that.

17
00:00:33,554 --> 00:00:35,372
No kidding. Finally she told me the truth.

18
00:00:35,406 --> 00:00:37,106
They don't want to hang out with us anymore

19
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:37,991
because we argue too much.

20
00:00:38,042 --> 00:00:40,110
- We do not argue too much.
- Yes, we do!

21
00:00:40,128 --> 00:00:42,412
No, we don't. What we do
is we disagree with volume.

22
00:00:42,446 --> 00:00:45,448
And hand gestures.

23
00:00:45,467 --> 00:00:48,302
Well, Charlotte said that
nobody can relax around us

24
00:00:48,336 --> 00:00:50,087
because of all of the loud disagreeing.

25
00:00:50,121 --> 00:00:51,288
Nobody can relax around us?!

26
00:00:51,306 --> 00:00:53,423
That's ridic... I am insanely relaxing.

27
00:00:53,457 --> 00:00:56,293
I'm like Xanax in human form.

28
00:00:56,311 --> 00:00:58,095
Well, you are a pill.

29
00:00:58,096 --> 00:00:59,647
Look, I think it's time we face the fact

30
00:00:59,764 --> 00:01:02,015
- that we have a problem.
- We do not have a problem, honey.

31
00:01:02,049 --> 00:01:04,066
The only problem is that
you think we have a problem.

32
00:01:04,184 --> 00:01:05,384
So you admit we have a problem.

33
00:01:05,469 --> 00:01:06,937
Wow, you guys started early today.

34
00:01:06,971 --> 00:01:08,238
Started what?

35
00:01:08,273 --> 00:01:11,141
Arguing. I could hear you
over Ryder's bathroom noises.

36
00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:13,243
See?

37
00:01:13,278 --> 00:01:15,279
Okay, fine, so we argue occasionally.

38
00:01:15,313 --> 00:01:16,730
That doesn't mean we have a problem.

39
00:01:16,764 --> 00:01:18,115
Lennox, you can handle this for us.

40
00:01:18,149 --> 00:01:19,816
You think your aunt and I argue too much?

41
00:01:19,834 --> 00:01:21,001
Yes.

42
00:01:21,035 --> 00:01:23,320
- She's totally right.
- She's obviously wrong.

54
00:01:45,026 --> 00:01:46,109
(Whirring loudly)

55
00:01:46,144 --> 00:01:47,177
(Whirring ceases)

56
00:01:47,195 --> 00:01:48,445
Hey, great news.

57
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:51,148
The air-conditioning repairman
is coming on Thursday.

58
00:01:51,182 --> 00:01:53,400
- Why?
- To fix the air-conditioning.

59
00:01:53,451 --> 00:01:55,652
Honey, it's not broken. You
just don't know how to set it.

60
00:01:55,670 --> 00:01:57,354
- Yes, I do.
- No, you don't. No, no.

61
00:01:57,372 --> 00:02:00,958
You can't use a hammer
to set the temperature.

62
00:02:00,992 --> 00:02:03,076
Joe, look, it needs some work.

63
00:02:03,127 --> 00:02:04,194
And so do we.

64
00:02:04,212 --> 00:02:05,913
Oh, jeez.

65
00:02:05,964 --> 00:02:07,664
Is this about the whole
arguing thing again...

66
00:02:07,698 --> 00:02:09,198
Which, by the way, we really do not do.

67
00:02:09,233 --> 00:02:10,733
We can't go more than three sentences

68
00:02:10,751 --> 00:02:11,868
without contradicting each other.

69
00:02:11,902 --> 00:02:13,186
That's...

70
00:02:14,055 --> 00:02:15,305
But...

71
00:02:17,208 --> 00:02:19,977
That's a new dress, isn't it?

72
00:02:20,011 --> 00:02:22,095
No. Look, all of my girlfriends

73
00:02:22,146 --> 00:02:24,181
that are in healthy relationships
go to couples' counseling.

74
00:02:24,215 --> 00:02:25,765
I think we should give it a try.

75
00:02:25,816 --> 00:02:26,934
Oh, my God.

76
00:02:27,694 --> 00:02:29,811
You want us to go to therapy?

77
00:02:29,862 --> 00:02:32,981
Like I gotta cry and stuff?

78
00:02:33,032 --> 00:02:35,033
Everyone can benefit from counseling.

79
00:02:35,068 --> 00:02:37,068
You don't only go to the
dentist when you have a cavity.

80
00:02:37,086 --> 00:02:38,119
You go for prevention.

81
00:02:38,170 --> 00:02:39,821
My dentist is a sadist.

82
00:02:39,906 --> 00:02:41,039
Okay, bad example.

83
00:02:41,074 --> 00:02:42,124
Couples' therapy is something

84
00:02:42,158 --> 00:02:43,742
you should do for better health.

85
00:02:43,776 --> 00:02:45,911
Like getting a colonoscopy.

86
00:02:45,945 --> 00:02:49,748
You really know how to
sell this, don't you?

87
00:02:49,782 --> 00:02:52,050
So you don't think we should
bother improving our relationship?

88
00:02:52,085 --> 00:02:53,835
I didn't say that. I just
don't think couples' therapy

89
00:02:53,886 --> 00:02:55,487
is a worthwhile investment for us, okay?

90
00:02:55,505 --> 00:02:56,905
Honey, you don't bring in a third party

91
00:02:56,956 --> 00:02:58,440
to help a couple out with their problems.

92
00:02:58,574 --> 00:03:01,326
Three does not equal two. It's just math.

93
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,678
Math is never wrong.

94
00:03:02,729 --> 00:03:03,795
You know what I think?

95
00:03:03,813 --> 00:03:05,013
I think you're resistant to therapy

96
00:03:05,064 --> 00:03:06,682
because you are not open to new ideas.

97
00:03:06,733 --> 00:03:09,101
That's not true. I'm
just closed to bad ideas.

98
00:03:09,135 --> 00:03:11,987
Okay, fine. I'm sure you
have lots of interesting ideas

99
00:03:12,021 --> 00:03:13,855
about how to improve our relationship.

100
00:03:13,906 --> 00:03:15,974
- I would love to hear them.
- I would love to share them with you.

101
00:03:16,008 --> 00:03:17,642
- Great, go ahead.
- Okay, first off...

102
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:19,778
(Whirs loudly, ceases)

103
00:03:19,812 --> 00:03:21,913
Okay, as I was saying, I don't...

104
00:03:21,981 --> 00:03:23,832
(Whirs loudly, ceases)

105
00:03:23,866 --> 00:03:26,952
- What I was trying to say was I don't...
- (Whirs loudly, ceases)

106
00:03:26,986 --> 00:03:29,304
You're going to keep doing that until
I agree to go to therapy, aren't you?

107
00:03:29,338 --> 00:03:31,156
- Oh, is this frustrating you?
- Little bit, yep.

108
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:33,208
Well, maybe you could
talk about that frustration

109
00:03:33,542 --> 00:03:34,793
in our first session.

110
00:03:34,827 --> 00:03:36,011
Fine, I'll go.

111
00:03:36,045 --> 00:03:38,764
- Yay!
- But not because you're right, okay?

112
00:03:38,798 --> 00:03:40,665
- It's because I'm just trying to...
- (Whirs loudly)

113
00:03:42,001 --> 00:03:44,686
- I...
- (Continues whirring)

114
00:03:46,139 --> 00:03:47,672
And then, at the 10-second mark,

115
00:03:47,690 --> 00:03:48,857
Cassandra's superpowers kick in.

116
00:03:48,891 --> 00:03:50,108
She's reading "Romeo and Juliet" and...

117
00:03:50,176 --> 00:03:52,027
And Juliet leaps off the page.

118
00:03:52,061 --> 00:03:54,846
Well, with my animation, it'll
be less of a graceful leap.

119
00:03:54,864 --> 00:03:56,114
More of a choppy bounce.

120
00:03:56,149 --> 00:03:58,950
And then, Cassandra says to Juliet,

121
00:03:58,985 --> 00:04:01,069
"listen, girl, I know he has
cute floppy hair and all..."

122
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,738
"But he is so not worth it."

123
00:04:02,789 --> 00:04:04,623
"Totally."

124
00:04:04,657 --> 00:04:06,658
You know, Zander, even though
you're halfway across the country,

125
00:04:06,692 --> 00:04:08,076
it feels like you're right here in my room.

126
00:04:08,127 --> 00:04:10,879
Just with a four-second delay.

127
00:04:10,913 --> 00:04:12,080
Yeah, I totally know...

128
00:04:12,131 --> 00:04:14,699
What...

129
00:04:14,717 --> 00:04:16,918
I was just messing with you.

130
00:04:16,969 --> 00:04:19,004
Hey, babe. Ryder said
you were on the phone.

131
00:04:19,038 --> 00:04:20,889
Hey, Emerson. (Clears throat)

132
00:04:20,923 --> 00:04:23,041
Yeah, I am just finishing
up a session with Zander.

133
00:04:23,059 --> 00:04:26,645
He's my... He's my creative partner.

134
00:04:26,679 --> 00:04:28,647
Oh, the ex.

135
00:04:28,681 --> 00:04:29,765
Dude, what's up?

136
00:04:29,816 --> 00:04:31,683
Hey, I know this could be awkward.

137
00:04:31,717 --> 00:04:33,101
New boyfriend, old boyfriend.

138
00:04:33,152 --> 00:04:34,886
But listen... I'm not jealous.

139
00:04:34,904 --> 00:04:36,404
Lennox told me it's strictly professional

140
00:04:36,455 --> 00:04:37,722
between you two now.

141
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:38,907
Ah, that's interesting.

142
00:04:38,941 --> 00:04:41,109
Lennox told me absolutely
nothing about a new boyfriend.

143
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:42,994
(Chuckles) Yeah.

144
00:04:43,029 --> 00:04:44,663
You know, I meant to tell you.

145
00:04:44,697 --> 00:04:45,997
I was just waiting for the right time.

146
00:04:46,032 --> 00:04:48,700
Apparently out of
nowhere is the right time.

147
00:04:48,734 --> 00:04:49,901
- Zander...
- No, no. It's fine.

148
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:51,787
I get it, you know. You're in college now.

149
00:04:51,838 --> 00:04:53,755
It's good that you're
meeting all the new freshmen.

150
00:04:53,790 --> 00:04:55,791
Actually, I'm her philosophy T.A.

151
00:04:55,842 --> 00:04:57,709
Oh, wow.

152
00:04:57,743 --> 00:04:59,845
You know, dating a teaching assistant

153
00:04:59,879 --> 00:05:01,046
is really not allowed at my school.

154
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:02,931
But, hey, that's probably
a rule that was created

155
00:05:02,965 --> 00:05:04,883
for no reason whatsoever.

156
00:05:04,917 --> 00:05:05,934
(Chuckles)

157
00:05:05,968 --> 00:05:08,019
Listen, we should really get going.

158
00:05:08,054 --> 00:05:10,722
Okay, well, have fun you two lovebirds.

159
00:05:10,756 --> 00:05:12,757
Or should I say one
sweet, innocent lovebird

160
00:05:12,775 --> 00:05:13,859
and one much older predator.

161
00:05:13,893 --> 00:05:16,645
Good-bye!

162
00:05:19,649 --> 00:05:21,817
Okay, this is not a
judgment about the therapist,

163
00:05:21,868 --> 00:05:23,101
but I just want to point out

164
00:05:23,119 --> 00:05:26,104
that all the magazines here suck.

165
00:05:26,122 --> 00:05:29,074
Joe, you promised you'd have an open mind.

166
00:05:29,108 --> 00:05:30,709
- Right.
- And when we go in there,

167
00:05:30,743 --> 00:05:32,627
- you'll participate, right?
- Yep.

168
00:05:32,662 --> 00:05:33,879
And you'll use more than one syllable?

169
00:05:33,913 --> 00:05:34,963
Done.

170
00:05:36,949 --> 00:05:39,718
Look, Dr. Kathryn Miller is
the best therapist in the city.

171
00:05:39,752 --> 00:05:41,720
She even saved my friend
Rebecca and Phil's marriage

172
00:05:41,754 --> 00:05:45,924
and that was after Phil became felicity.

173
00:05:45,958 --> 00:05:47,726
I'm just going to throw this out there.

174
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:50,795
That's not going to be our issue, okay?

175
00:05:50,813 --> 00:05:52,097
Thanks for pointing that out, though.

176
00:05:52,131 --> 00:05:53,932
And you can stop with the
sales pitch, Mel. I'm here.

177
00:05:53,966 --> 00:05:55,767
Don't I get a sticker or
something for just showing up?

178
00:05:55,801 --> 00:05:57,135
Yeah, Joe, that's why we're here.

179
00:05:57,153 --> 00:05:59,938
For the stickers.

180
00:05:59,972 --> 00:06:03,608
Oh, you must be...

181
00:06:03,642 --> 00:06:04,976
Joe?

182
00:06:07,029 --> 00:06:08,663
Katie?

183
00:06:08,698 --> 00:06:10,648
Actually, I go by Kathryn here.

184
00:06:10,666 --> 00:06:11,917
Oh, you guys know each other?

185
00:06:11,951 --> 00:06:13,818
(Chuckles)

186
00:06:13,836 --> 00:06:16,087
It's a funny story, actually, honey.

187
00:06:16,122 --> 00:06:18,656
- We...
- Dated.

188
00:06:18,674 --> 00:06:19,925
Briefly. Years ago.

189
00:06:19,959 --> 00:06:20,959
She beat me to it.

190
00:06:20,993 --> 00:06:22,627
If this is a problem,

191
00:06:22,661 --> 00:06:24,846
I'm happy to waive my
24-hour cancellation fee.

192
00:06:24,881 --> 00:06:26,831
No, don't, you're the
best therapist in the city

193
00:06:26,849 --> 00:06:28,934
and it was tough to get
certain people down here.

194
00:06:28,968 --> 00:06:30,835
Well, if neither of you have an issue,

195
00:06:30,853 --> 00:06:32,804
I'm comfortable putting the past aside.

196
00:06:32,838 --> 00:06:34,672
I mean, what happened between Joe and me

197
00:06:34,690 --> 00:06:35,840
was so long ago.

198
00:06:35,858 --> 00:06:37,842
- Years ago, actually.
- It's insignificant now.

199
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:39,327
Yeah, it was a blip. It was a blip, really.

200
00:06:39,361 --> 00:06:40,812
Not even a blip, actually, more like a...

201
00:06:40,846 --> 00:06:44,816
You know, a... blip!

202
00:06:44,850 --> 00:06:46,785
Then we're good. This is not a big deal.

203
00:06:46,819 --> 00:06:48,669
I can't tell you the amount
of times we've run into someone

204
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,438
I've hooked up with... I
mean, happens all the time.

205
00:06:50,672 --> 00:06:51,823
Like, all the time.

206
00:06:51,857 --> 00:06:53,124
Okay. Okay, Mel... Mel, thank you.

207
00:06:53,159 --> 00:06:55,126
Let's save something for
the session, shall we?

208
00:06:57,747 --> 00:06:58,863
So we were in the parking structure

209
00:06:58,881 --> 00:06:59,998
and I suggested going up a level

210
00:07:00,032 --> 00:07:02,584
but Joe refused, and I park
in that structure every day.

211
00:07:02,635 --> 00:07:04,803
I mean, every day.

212
00:07:04,837 --> 00:07:06,838
You know, I'm noticing a pattern here.

213
00:07:06,872 --> 00:07:08,974
What I'm hearing is that Joe is, by nature,

214
00:07:09,008 --> 00:07:11,709
very strong-willed and
not open to new ideas.

215
00:07:11,727 --> 00:07:13,878
What do you think about that, Joe?

216
00:07:15,815 --> 00:07:17,365
You really hit the nail on the head, Katie.

217
00:07:17,399 --> 00:07:19,884
I mean, you are an
amazingly perceptive person.

218
00:07:19,902 --> 00:07:21,937
So you agree this is
something you need to work on?

219
00:07:21,988 --> 00:07:24,773
Absolutely. Absolutely.
100%. And thank you.

220
00:07:24,824 --> 00:07:26,608
Thank you so much for
pointing that out to me.

221
00:07:26,692 --> 00:07:30,912
I don't know why no one else
has ever said that to me before.

222
00:07:30,947 --> 00:07:32,730
Are you kidding me?

223
00:07:32,748 --> 00:07:35,700
I said that. I said that yesterday.

224
00:07:35,734 --> 00:07:36,901
I think I would have remembered

225
00:07:36,919 --> 00:07:38,436
if she had said something that insightful.

226
00:07:38,470 --> 00:07:40,956
Clearly not.

227
00:07:41,007 --> 00:07:42,791
Perhaps you're both right.

228
00:07:42,842 --> 00:07:45,093
Sometimes it's difficult for
couples to really hear each other.

229
00:07:45,127 --> 00:07:48,763
Wow, that is another great point, Katie.

230
00:07:48,798 --> 00:07:50,098
I'm sorry.

231
00:07:50,132 --> 00:07:51,933
Dr. Miller. (Laughs)

232
00:07:51,968 --> 00:07:54,686
You know, this has been such an
eye-opening experience for me.

233
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,972
I mean, I guess sometimes
it really does take

234
00:07:57,023 --> 00:07:59,808
a third person to come in and help
two people out with their problems.

235
00:07:59,859 --> 00:08:01,926
I mean, you know, three
is greater than two.

236
00:08:01,944 --> 00:08:03,895
It's really... It's really just math.

237
00:08:03,929 --> 00:08:05,947
Right?

238
00:08:07,733 --> 00:08:08,817
Yeah.

239
00:08:08,868 --> 00:08:10,902
You know, Mel, one syllable responses

240
00:08:10,936 --> 00:08:12,871
are not always the most helpful.

241
00:08:15,041 --> 00:08:17,942
She's good.

242
00:08:24,429 --> 00:08:26,481
- Zander.
- Surprise.

243
00:08:26,643 --> 00:08:27,643
What are you doing here?

244
00:08:27,677 --> 00:08:28,811
I was really hoping for,

245
00:08:28,845 --> 00:08:31,564
"hey, have you been working out?"

246
00:08:31,615 --> 00:08:32,698
'Cause I have.

247
00:08:32,733 --> 00:08:35,952
Wait... what... you
have class in 10 minutes.

248
00:08:35,986 --> 00:08:37,787
In Vermont.

249
00:08:37,821 --> 00:08:40,623
You know, I think you're going to miss it.

250
00:08:40,657 --> 00:08:42,658
I actually came into town
for my aunt's funeral.

251
00:08:42,692 --> 00:08:43,960
Oh. Oh, my God.

252
00:08:43,994 --> 00:08:45,995
I am so sorry. Come in.

253
00:08:46,029 --> 00:08:49,799
Thanks. I appreciate it.

254
00:08:49,833 --> 00:08:52,534
Actually, it was my aunt's
cat's funeral, but...

255
00:08:52,553 --> 00:08:54,587
You know, now that he's gone,

256
00:08:54,638 --> 00:08:58,540
it's really just a matter of time
before the old lady lets go too.

257
00:08:58,559 --> 00:08:59,875
Anyways, point is, I'm here.

258
00:08:59,893 --> 00:09:01,477
What about your midterms?

259
00:09:01,511 --> 00:09:03,846
They let you make 'em up. I think.

260
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:05,547
You know what... I'll
just tell the Dean that

261
00:09:05,566 --> 00:09:06,816
I was sad.

262
00:09:06,850 --> 00:09:09,518
Gets you out of anything at art school.

263
00:09:09,552 --> 00:09:10,853
Uh-huh...

264
00:09:10,887 --> 00:09:12,772
Right, okay. So listen, len.

265
00:09:12,823 --> 00:09:15,491
The untimely passing of my aunt's cat

266
00:09:15,525 --> 00:09:18,894
has got me thinking.

267
00:09:18,912 --> 00:09:21,914
Should you really be dating
your teaching assistant?

268
00:09:21,949 --> 00:09:24,784
I mean, should anybody?
Really? 'Cause... ugh.

269
00:09:24,835 --> 00:09:25,918
Oh, gee.

270
00:09:25,953 --> 00:09:27,753
You know, the death of a cat affects us all

271
00:09:27,788 --> 00:09:29,705
in different ways.

272
00:09:29,739 --> 00:09:32,541
And some that are none
of your business, Zander.

273
00:09:32,575 --> 00:09:33,876
Yeah, yeah, uh-huh. Understood.

274
00:09:33,910 --> 00:09:35,928
So aren't you just like
a little bit concerned

275
00:09:35,963 --> 00:09:38,580
that he'll treat you differently
than the other students?

276
00:09:38,599 --> 00:09:41,934
Because, you know, you
treat him differently.

277
00:09:41,969 --> 00:09:43,603
What, you think he'll
give me an automatic "A"

278
00:09:43,637 --> 00:09:44,937
because I'm his girlfriend?

279
00:09:44,972 --> 00:09:47,773
Not automatic. I mean, I'm
sure you'll have to work for it.

280
00:09:47,808 --> 00:09:49,859
Excuse me?

281
00:09:49,893 --> 00:09:50,943
No. No. Mm-mm.

282
00:09:50,978 --> 00:09:53,529
No, see, the... What I meant was...

283
00:09:53,563 --> 00:09:55,948
Is that he's... He's older, you know.

284
00:09:55,983 --> 00:09:57,650
And he might abuse his power.

285
00:09:57,701 --> 00:10:00,653
I'm 18 and he's 23, okay?

286
00:10:00,704 --> 00:10:02,705
There is nothing wrong with that.

287
00:10:02,739 --> 00:10:03,739
<i>Mel: Lennox.</i>

288
00:10:03,773 --> 00:10:04,874
Oh, what did Mel and Joe say

289
00:10:04,908 --> 00:10:06,392
when you told them you
were dating your T.A.?

290
00:10:06,443 --> 00:10:07,994
Shh! They'll hear you.

291
00:10:08,045 --> 00:10:09,996
Oh! You haven't told them yet

292
00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:11,914
because you know what
you're doing is wrong... ha!

293
00:10:11,948 --> 00:10:13,633
Oh, Zander.

294
00:10:13,667 --> 00:10:15,584
I didn't know you were in town.

295
00:10:15,618 --> 00:10:17,786
So what exactly is Lennox doing wrong?

296
00:10:17,804 --> 00:10:19,922
Well, Mel, I hate to rat Lennox out.

297
00:10:19,956 --> 00:10:22,558
But she's been...

298
00:10:22,592 --> 00:10:24,760
Smuggling food out of the dining hall.

299
00:10:24,794 --> 00:10:25,961
Oh, that's not wrong.

300
00:10:25,979 --> 00:10:27,963
In politics, we define wrong

301
00:10:27,981 --> 00:10:30,816
as "will anyone really notice?"

302
00:10:30,851 --> 00:10:31,901
You know, speaking of which,

303
00:10:31,935 --> 00:10:32,985
at the budget meeting today

304
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:36,638
I yelled out, "dibs on the bagels!"

305
00:10:36,657 --> 00:10:37,823
Here you go. All right. Save me one.

306
00:10:40,027 --> 00:10:41,977
Hey, Joe, we need to talk

307
00:10:41,995 --> 00:10:43,746
about this morning's therapy session.

308
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:45,865
Happy to. Can't wait for the next session.

309
00:10:45,916 --> 00:10:47,783
Yeah, well, that will be Tuesday

310
00:10:47,817 --> 00:10:50,652
the 14th of never.

311
00:10:50,671 --> 00:10:52,654
What was that little "teacher's
pet" routine of yours?

312
00:10:52,673 --> 00:10:53,655
What are you talking about?

313
00:10:53,674 --> 00:10:54,840
Come on! You spent the whole time

314
00:10:54,875 --> 00:10:56,676
bending over backwards
trying to kiss her butt.

315
00:10:56,710 --> 00:10:58,794
It was like watching the
Cirque du Soleil of ass-kissing.

316
00:10:58,828 --> 00:11:01,764
Whoa, wait a minute. Wait a minute.

317
00:11:01,798 --> 00:11:03,933
Hold up, hold up. Are you jealous?

318
00:11:03,967 --> 00:11:06,802
Of a tall, beautiful,
highly-educated professional woman

319
00:11:06,836 --> 00:11:07,937
you used to date?

320
00:11:07,971 --> 00:11:09,805
Please.

321
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:11,724
Oh, come on. It was a long time ago.

322
00:11:11,775 --> 00:11:14,009
It meant nothing, you know, and
after a short period of time,

323
00:11:14,027 --> 00:11:16,696
- I broke up with her.
- You broke up with her?

324
00:11:16,730 --> 00:11:18,781
Yeah, she wasn't what I was
looking for, so I ended it.

325
00:11:18,815 --> 00:11:20,616
You broke up with her.

326
00:11:20,650 --> 00:11:21,867
Yes, I broke up with her, all right?

327
00:11:21,902 --> 00:11:23,569
It didn't matter to her
and it didn't matter to me.

328
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:25,104
And I thought it didn't matter to you,

329
00:11:25,138 --> 00:11:26,255
but apparently I was wrong.

330
00:11:26,289 --> 00:11:29,658
Wait, so if this wasn't about Kathryn,

331
00:11:29,692 --> 00:11:32,545
then... okay. I get it.

332
00:11:32,579 --> 00:11:33,829
You were trying to beat me at therapy.

333
00:11:33,863 --> 00:11:35,864
Honey, please. It's not a competition.

334
00:11:35,882 --> 00:11:37,800
Okay? (Laughs)

335
00:11:37,834 --> 00:11:40,803
But if it was, probably
would have been a shutout.

336
00:11:40,837 --> 00:11:44,840
You know, therapy is not
about who wins and loses.

337
00:11:44,874 --> 00:11:46,842
It's about doing what's
best for the relationship.

338
00:11:46,876 --> 00:11:48,644
But if it was a competition,

339
00:11:48,678 --> 00:11:50,813
I would smoke you like a Cuban cigar.

340
00:11:50,847 --> 00:11:53,599
Yeah, well, we'll just have
to see next time, won't we?

341
00:11:53,650 --> 00:11:54,984
Mm-hmm.

342
00:11:55,018 --> 00:11:56,569
Clearly we need help.

343
00:11:56,603 --> 00:11:58,053
Yeah.

344
00:12:02,659 --> 00:12:04,994
Oh, hi, Mel. Have you been here long?

345
00:12:05,028 --> 00:12:06,895
Oh, don't worry, I didn't
hear anything you said

346
00:12:06,913 --> 00:12:08,531
to your last patient.

347
00:12:08,565 --> 00:12:09,999
Just the "wah, wah, nobody loves me" part.

348
00:12:10,033 --> 00:12:13,836
Actually, I was in there by myself.

349
00:12:13,870 --> 00:12:14,903
Kidding!

350
00:12:14,921 --> 00:12:17,573
You know, Mel, I am impressed

351
00:12:17,591 --> 00:12:19,274
that you're continuing
to see me even though

352
00:12:19,308 --> 00:12:20,593
you know I dated Joe.

353
00:12:20,627 --> 00:12:22,261
A lot of people wouldn't
be able to handle that.

354
00:12:22,312 --> 00:12:23,763
It shows a lot of maturity.

355
00:12:23,797 --> 00:12:24,964
Well, I'm impressed that you're okay

356
00:12:25,015 --> 00:12:28,017
hearing about me and
Joe after he dumped you.

357
00:12:28,051 --> 00:12:30,553
I have to say I am not on the best of terms

358
00:12:30,587 --> 00:12:32,605
with a lot of the guys that
gave me the old heave-ho.

359
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:34,756
That's what Joe told you, is it?

360
00:12:34,775 --> 00:12:36,025
- What do you mean?
- Oh, nothing.

361
00:12:36,059 --> 00:12:38,694
Your face didn't really
look like, "oh, nothing."

362
00:12:38,728 --> 00:12:40,646
Well, not to dredge up the past,

363
00:12:40,697 --> 00:12:42,782
but I was definitely
the one who broke it off.

364
00:12:42,816 --> 00:12:43,899
Not Joe.

365
00:12:43,933 --> 00:12:46,986
Oh, okay. Well, I guess, you know,

366
00:12:47,037 --> 00:12:49,605
Joe probably shaded the truth out of pride.

367
00:12:49,623 --> 00:12:51,574
The therapeutic term for that is "lying."

368
00:12:51,608 --> 00:12:53,959
Okay, but it's not that
big of a deal, right?

369
00:12:53,994 --> 00:12:55,944
'Cause Joe promised he's
gonna work on himself.

370
00:12:55,962 --> 00:12:57,630
Yes, but what if he's lying?

371
00:12:57,714 --> 00:12:59,965
Since apparently he has no problem lying.

372
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,584
But you said in our last session

373
00:13:01,618 --> 00:13:02,751
that Joe was making real progress.

374
00:13:02,785 --> 00:13:05,621
Yes, but that's before
I knew about the lying.

375
00:13:05,639 --> 00:13:08,891
Okay, could you stop
saying lying for a sec?

376
00:13:08,925 --> 00:13:09,975
Listen, Mel,

377
00:13:10,010 --> 00:13:11,760
I'm not saying this as your therapist,

378
00:13:11,794 --> 00:13:12,928
but woman to woman,

379
00:13:12,962 --> 00:13:14,897
I'd say that Joe's revisionist history

380
00:13:14,931 --> 00:13:15,981
about who broke up with who

381
00:13:16,016 --> 00:13:17,983
is just, well, very telling.

382
00:13:18,018 --> 00:13:20,969
Telling like telling a fun story, or...

383
00:13:20,987 --> 00:13:22,655
Telling of a larger issue.

384
00:13:22,689 --> 00:13:24,824
I'm just glad I spotted
the warning signs early

385
00:13:24,858 --> 00:13:26,525
and got out when I did.

386
00:13:26,576 --> 00:13:27,993
Look, I know things didn't
work out with you and him,

387
00:13:28,078 --> 00:13:29,862
but Joe and I have a great relationship.

388
00:13:29,913 --> 00:13:31,780
And that's why you came
to see a therapist...

389
00:13:31,814 --> 00:13:33,815
To talk about how great
your relationship is?

390
00:13:33,834 --> 00:13:34,917
Our relationship is solid.

391
00:13:34,951 --> 00:13:36,752
We just came in for a little tune-up.

392
00:13:36,786 --> 00:13:39,988
Listen, Mel, if I could give you
a piece of advice about Joe...

393
00:13:40,006 --> 00:13:42,875
Run! Run while you still can.

394
00:13:42,926 --> 00:13:45,761
But, well, Joe loves me.

395
00:13:45,795 --> 00:13:47,763
And if he can't be honest with you now,

396
00:13:47,797 --> 00:13:49,932
what's gonna happen in the future?

397
00:13:49,966 --> 00:13:50,933
<i>(Door opening)</i>

398
00:13:50,967 --> 00:13:52,668
Hey! I'm here, I'm here.

399
00:13:52,686 --> 00:13:54,036
I'm so sorry I'm late. What did I miss?

400
00:13:54,070 --> 00:13:55,888
Nothing. We haven't started yet.

401
00:13:55,939 --> 00:13:57,606
Oh, good.

402
00:13:57,641 --> 00:13:59,525
(Stammers) I just
remembered... I have a thing.

403
00:13:59,559 --> 00:14:00,643
You have a thing? What thing?

404
00:14:00,677 --> 00:14:02,678
A big thing. A thing we can't miss.

405
00:14:02,696 --> 00:14:04,846
And we have to go right
now and never come back.

406
00:14:04,865 --> 00:14:06,532
But wait, what?!

407
00:14:06,566 --> 00:14:09,618
I can't believe I forgot
about it until just now. Bye!

408
00:14:09,653 --> 00:14:10,953
But I... I... I just paid for parking.

409
00:14:10,987 --> 00:14:12,688
It was like eight dollars.

410
00:14:16,015 --> 00:14:18,016
Oh, my goodness. Check out this drivel

411
00:14:18,050 --> 00:14:20,985
your fellow student wrote
on the hegelian dialectic.

412
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:24,322
"Mr. Hegel's cool ideas
never truly go out of style."

413
00:14:24,356 --> 00:14:26,024
Uh, you know what, babe?

414
00:14:26,058 --> 00:14:28,192
I really don't think you
should read that to me.

415
00:14:28,226 --> 00:14:29,327
You're right.

416
00:14:29,361 --> 00:14:31,112
Just hearing it could
kill brain cells. "D."

417
00:14:31,163 --> 00:14:32,229
Oh, wait.

418
00:14:32,247 --> 00:14:34,065
No, his parents are alumni.

419
00:14:34,083 --> 00:14:36,084
(Winces) "C."

420
00:14:36,118 --> 00:14:38,169
Ooh.

421
00:14:38,203 --> 00:14:41,238
Here's an interesting
test by Lennox Scanlon.

422
00:14:41,256 --> 00:14:43,041
Oh, you know what?

423
00:14:43,075 --> 00:14:45,343
I... I can leave the
room while you grade it.

424
00:14:45,377 --> 00:14:47,211
No, no, no. You don't have to do that.

425
00:14:47,245 --> 00:14:49,931
Your smokin' hot presence won't sway me.

426
00:14:49,965 --> 00:14:52,083
Okay, well, just don't tell me my grade.

427
00:14:52,101 --> 00:14:54,251
Shh, shh, shh. I'm reading something.

428
00:14:54,269 --> 00:14:58,255
Something very intelligent

429
00:14:58,273 --> 00:15:00,925
that bears out my choice in girlfriends.

430
00:15:00,943 --> 00:15:02,193
Uh-oh!

431
00:15:02,227 --> 00:15:04,195
What's uh-oh?

432
00:15:04,229 --> 00:15:06,898
You didn't answer the question
on the back of the page.

433
00:15:06,932 --> 00:15:09,150
(Gasps) There was a question on the back?

434
00:15:09,201 --> 00:15:10,868
Lennox, relax... I know you know

435
00:15:10,903 --> 00:15:13,871
the supposed contradictions
between being and not being.

436
00:15:13,906 --> 00:15:14,872
We talked about this. Right?

437
00:15:14,907 --> 00:15:15,873
Yeah, but...

438
00:15:15,908 --> 00:15:17,291
Check. "A."

439
00:15:17,326 --> 00:15:19,077
What are you doing?

440
00:15:19,111 --> 00:15:21,245
I'm just giving you the
grade you deserve, babe.

441
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:24,281
Um, okay.

442
00:15:24,299 --> 00:15:27,051
And just act all surprised
when I hand back the tests.

443
00:15:27,086 --> 00:15:28,169
Like it's your birthday.

444
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:29,253
Hmm...

445
00:15:33,258 --> 00:15:36,010
So, then... what do you
want to do, Ms. Burke?

446
00:15:36,061 --> 00:15:39,130
Well, you know, I thought
I knew until this afternoon.

447
00:15:39,148 --> 00:15:40,564
Oh, you mean about the air-conditioning?

448
00:15:40,598 --> 00:15:42,466
Um, I... I don't know.
What do you think, Wayne?

449
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:43,901
I say dump it.

450
00:15:43,936 --> 00:15:45,336
You know I've always told you the truth.

451
00:15:45,370 --> 00:15:47,138
You're better off replacing
it with a new system

452
00:15:47,156 --> 00:15:48,906
that doesn't have so many issues.

453
00:15:48,941 --> 00:15:51,025
But I like this one.

454
00:15:51,076 --> 00:15:53,010
I mean, even though it
can be loud and annoying

455
00:15:53,045 --> 00:15:55,146
and sometimes I want to smack it...

456
00:15:55,164 --> 00:15:56,313
Huh?

457
00:15:56,331 --> 00:15:58,950
I mean, I'm comfortable
with this one, you know?

458
00:15:58,984 --> 00:16:00,384
I mean, the current air-conditioning unit.

459
00:16:00,419 --> 00:16:02,003
I don't know. You stick with this one,

460
00:16:02,037 --> 00:16:04,122
it's just gonna cause you a world of pain.

461
00:16:04,156 --> 00:16:06,323
But what if this system is the one?

462
00:16:06,341 --> 00:16:07,992
You know, for my house.

463
00:16:08,010 --> 00:16:10,845
I mean, I don't appreciate
people telling me

464
00:16:10,879 --> 00:16:13,097
I should get rid of something
I've lived with for so long

465
00:16:13,132 --> 00:16:15,099
and can see spending
the rest of my life with.

466
00:16:17,886 --> 00:16:21,055
This isn't really about
the air conditioner, is it?

467
00:16:23,892 --> 00:16:25,860
How 'bout I come back in a week or two

468
00:16:25,894 --> 00:16:28,029
after you've had a chance
to collect your thoughts...

469
00:16:28,063 --> 00:16:29,280
On air-conditioning.

470
00:16:31,349 --> 00:16:33,317
(Sobbing)

471
00:16:34,352 --> 00:16:35,870
Yeah?

472
00:16:35,904 --> 00:16:37,321
Hi. I have something for you.

473
00:16:37,355 --> 00:16:40,024
Oh, is it unsolicited advice
on how to live my life?

474
00:16:40,042 --> 00:16:42,076
'Cause I'm all stocked up.

475
00:16:42,127 --> 00:16:44,328
No, no. It's just some new
artwork for our web series.

476
00:16:44,362 --> 00:16:47,131
Shouldn't you be getting back to school?

477
00:16:47,166 --> 00:16:49,133
Yeah. I've got my meeting
with the Dean tomorrow,

478
00:16:49,168 --> 00:16:51,886
so I'm working on my look
of despair. How's this?

479
00:16:54,006 --> 00:16:55,173
Stick out your lower lip a little bit.

480
00:16:55,207 --> 00:16:57,975
Yeah, there you go.

481
00:16:58,010 --> 00:16:58,976
Come in.

482
00:17:00,095 --> 00:17:02,146
But hey, you know, while I'm here,

483
00:17:02,181 --> 00:17:03,181
I just want to say

484
00:17:03,215 --> 00:17:04,849
I'm really sorry about yesterday.

485
00:17:04,883 --> 00:17:06,684
When I implied that you're
getting special treatment

486
00:17:06,718 --> 00:17:08,853
by dating your T.A. I was way off base.

487
00:17:08,887 --> 00:17:11,155
'Cause you're like the most
principled person I know.

488
00:17:11,190 --> 00:17:13,157
Don't say that, please.

489
00:17:13,192 --> 00:17:15,276
No, it's true. And I just say that

490
00:17:15,327 --> 00:17:17,111
because I really care about you.

491
00:17:17,162 --> 00:17:19,113
As a friend. Not as a girlfriend.

492
00:17:19,164 --> 00:17:21,082
'Cause, you know, that's
where we're at right now,

493
00:17:21,116 --> 00:17:24,902
because you're... because
you're with someone else. Right?

494
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:27,238
Yes, I am.

495
00:17:27,429 --> 00:17:28,596
I should be getting back to Vermont.

496
00:17:28,597 --> 00:17:29,655
Right.

497
00:17:30,177 --> 00:17:32,011
So, bye.

498
00:17:41,354 --> 00:17:42,905
I gotta go.

499
00:17:48,278 --> 00:17:50,246
Hey, Mel. I got a guy in the garage

500
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:51,914
waiting for a training session,

501
00:17:51,948 --> 00:17:53,065
but I saw your car in the driveway

502
00:17:53,083 --> 00:17:54,867
so I just wanted to come say hi.

503
00:17:54,901 --> 00:17:57,069
Oh, hello.

504
00:17:57,087 --> 00:17:58,254
Hey, um... are you okay?

505
00:17:58,288 --> 00:17:59,788
'Cause you seemed a little...

506
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:01,874
Upset this afternoon.

507
00:18:01,908 --> 00:18:04,793
Oh, I was. But, you know, I'm okay now.

508
00:18:04,845 --> 00:18:07,012
This helped.

509
00:18:07,047 --> 00:18:08,130
All right.

510
00:18:08,181 --> 00:18:09,915
(Sighing)

511
00:18:09,933 --> 00:18:11,934
Hey, Joe, can I ask you a quick question?

512
00:18:11,968 --> 00:18:13,085
Sure. What's up?

513
00:18:13,103 --> 00:18:14,920
Are we gonna make it?

514
00:18:14,938 --> 00:18:16,138
Of course.

515
00:18:17,941 --> 00:18:20,109
What are we talking about?

516
00:18:20,143 --> 00:18:22,194
Be honest. Do you think
we have a future together?

517
00:18:22,229 --> 00:18:23,262
As a couple?

518
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:25,064
Where's this coming from, Mel?

519
00:18:25,098 --> 00:18:27,983
Well, uh... when I talked to Kathryn today

520
00:18:28,034 --> 00:18:29,869
she told me something very interesting.

521
00:18:29,903 --> 00:18:31,987
She said that she broke up with you.

522
00:18:32,038 --> 00:18:33,822
Is that true?

523
00:18:33,874 --> 00:18:36,158
You know what? Now that I think about it

524
00:18:36,209 --> 00:18:38,994
that... That is what happened.

525
00:18:39,045 --> 00:18:41,247
So then why did you tell me you dumped her?

526
00:18:41,281 --> 00:18:43,082
Man, it's hot in here.

527
00:18:43,116 --> 00:18:45,000
The A.C. guy ever come over today or what?

528
00:18:45,051 --> 00:18:48,003
Don't change the subject.

529
00:18:48,054 --> 00:18:50,890
Look, Mel, um... there's
a perfectly good explanation

530
00:18:50,924 --> 00:18:52,224
for all this, okay? And once you hear it,

531
00:18:52,259 --> 00:18:54,310
it will answer all of your questions.

532
00:18:57,964 --> 00:18:59,899
I lied.

533
00:18:59,933 --> 00:19:01,066
How could you do that?

534
00:19:01,101 --> 00:19:02,902
Do you want a relationship built on lies?

535
00:19:02,936 --> 00:19:05,137
Wait a minute, now. It's
not lies. It was a lie.

536
00:19:05,155 --> 00:19:07,156
And you wouldn't have even known
about it if I hadn't told you.

537
00:19:07,190 --> 00:19:08,190
You didn't tell me.

538
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:11,193
Point taken.

539
00:19:11,244 --> 00:19:13,245
Why would you lie to me?

540
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:14,947
It's not what you think, all right?

541
00:19:14,981 --> 00:19:17,166
I... I lied to, um...

542
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:19,118
To what, Joe?

543
00:19:19,152 --> 00:19:21,870
I lied because I didn't want you to think

544
00:19:21,922 --> 00:19:24,006
you were dating somebody's cast-off.

545
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:25,174
That's why you did it?

546
00:19:25,208 --> 00:19:26,842
Yes, yes. Okay?

547
00:19:26,876 --> 00:19:29,094
Because you deserve the
best and I'm not always that.

548
00:19:29,129 --> 00:19:31,096
And you know, I... I guess I thought

549
00:19:31,131 --> 00:19:33,132
that if you knew that she dumped me

550
00:19:33,166 --> 00:19:35,000
that you'd think less of me,

551
00:19:35,018 --> 00:19:36,302
and, you know, I kind of...

552
00:19:36,336 --> 00:19:40,055
I... I want to be seen
as perfect in your eyes.

553
00:19:40,106 --> 00:19:44,009
Oh, Joe. I'll never see you that way.

554
00:19:48,064 --> 00:19:50,115
Thanks a lot.

555
00:19:50,150 --> 00:19:52,017
No, it's just that, you know,

556
00:19:52,035 --> 00:19:54,870
I guess I'm not done
trying to impress you yet.

557
00:19:54,904 --> 00:19:56,855
Oh, and I hope you never are.

558
00:19:58,124 --> 00:20:00,125
Hey, you know, I don't think
it's so bad that we argue.

559
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:02,294
We don't argue. Who says we argue?

560
00:20:02,329 --> 00:20:04,129
Okay! We disagree with volume

561
00:20:04,164 --> 00:20:06,065
and drive each other insane.

562
00:20:06,099 --> 00:20:07,249
But you know, we get it all out.

563
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:08,334
We don't hold anything back.

564
00:20:08,368 --> 00:20:10,302
Yeah? I'm actually kinda

565
00:20:10,337 --> 00:20:12,171
holding something back right now.

566
00:20:13,923 --> 00:20:15,390
It's got nothing to do
with arguing, though.

567
00:20:15,441 --> 00:20:16,141
(Laughs)

568
00:20:16,176 --> 00:20:17,893
Don't you have a client to train?

569
00:20:17,927 --> 00:20:19,261
Yeah, I told him to warm up

570
00:20:19,312 --> 00:20:21,063
for ten minutes on the stairmaster.

571
00:20:21,097 --> 00:20:23,232
That means we got nine whole minutes, baby.

572
00:20:23,266 --> 00:20:24,266
Come on.

573
00:20:27,170 --> 00:20:28,603
Hey Wayne.

574
00:20:29,028 --> 00:20:30,561
I'm sorry to bother you, Ms. Burke.

575
00:20:30,593 --> 00:20:33,195
Yeah, wayne, I thought we weren't
going to talk for a couple of weeks.

576
00:20:33,217 --> 00:20:35,211
- This couldn't wait.
- What is it?

577
00:20:36,650 --> 00:20:38,839
Your air conditionner is perfectly fine.

578
00:20:38,894 --> 00:20:39,856
That's why I'm here.

579
00:20:39,895 --> 00:20:41,131
But you told me to dump it.

580
00:20:41,146 --> 00:20:43,798
You said it was outmoded and would
cause me nothing but pain and heartache.

581
00:20:45,158 --> 00:20:46,253
I lied.

582
00:20:47,317 --> 00:20:50,156
I've been getting a lot of pressure
from the suits to sell the new systems.

583
00:20:50,195 --> 00:20:51,853
That's where all the profit is, but,

584
00:20:52,166 --> 00:20:54,238
then I felt terrible, because, well,

585
00:20:54,684 --> 00:20:55,896
our relationship

586
00:20:55,928 --> 00:20:58,211
is more important than
moving some new condenser.

587
00:20:58,242 --> 00:21:00,182
But the air conditioner's
not working properly.

588
00:21:00,237 --> 00:21:01,261
Nah...

589
00:21:01,285 --> 00:21:02,552
you just don't know how to set it.

590
00:21:03,248 --> 00:21:04,467
I can show you.

591
00:21:04,499 --> 00:21:06,767
Wait, wait, wait, so you're saying
my system is fine and wonderful?

592
00:21:06,782 --> 00:21:07,658
Yeah.

593
00:21:07,674 --> 00:21:09,824
This could be the last system you ever buy.

594
00:21:09,944 --> 00:21:11,412
It should last a lifetime.

595
00:21:14,253 --> 00:21:16,185
Bless you!

596
00:21:16,577 --> 00:21:20,619
