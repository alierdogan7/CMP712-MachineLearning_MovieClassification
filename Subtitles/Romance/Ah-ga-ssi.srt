1
00:01:20,659 --> 00:01:21,829
Scoundrel.

2
00:01:21,829 --> 00:01:24,000
Get lost.

3
00:01:29,659 --> 00:01:31,659
These damn....

4
00:02:04,659 --> 00:02:07,000
I should be the one going.

5
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,329
It should be me who's going to that Japanese household.

6
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Don't miss the train.

7
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Go, hurry.

8
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,830
You should rest a bit.

9
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:05,500
We're not there yet.

10
00:03:36,329 --> 00:03:37,329
Hello

11
00:03:37,329 --> 00:03:39,000
I am Ok Ju.

12
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,659
This property has three buildings.

13
00:03:40,659 --> 00:03:46,159
The main house is an English style building, and the rest are Japanese style building that make up the living quarters.

14
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:50,500
The Japanese architecture can't compare with the grandiose style of the English.

15
00:03:51,159 --> 00:03:57,330
The Mistress likes both Japanese and English architecture, that's why it's built this way.

16
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,659
Besides this, there is another wing.

17
00:03:59,659 --> 00:04:02,500
The Mistress made a library there.

18
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:04,500
Following, is the third building, servants' quarters.

19
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:07,159
Since you are her personal maid, you will not be sleeping with the rest of the servants.

20
00:04:07,159 --> 00:04:09,659
You may eat the Mistress' leftover food.

21
00:04:09,659 --> 00:04:12,160
But the leftover tea must be brought to the kitchen.

22
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:14,829
Left over oil and soap should be brought to the housekeeper.

23
00:04:14,829 --> 00:04:17,660
If you are caught stealing, you will be kicked out immediately.

24
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:20,500
But, I believe you're not that kind of person Tamako.

25
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:21,829
ah

26
00:04:21,829 --> 00:04:23,160
You will be called Tamako from now on.

27
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:26,829
Leaning on Ok Ju

28
00:04:26,829 --> 00:04:28,500
I am Sasaki.

29
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:33,829
Yes.

30
00:04:33,829 --> 00:04:35,829
The Miss' daily routine is simple.

31
00:04:35,829 --> 00:04:37,500
A walk in the backyard.

32
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:40,500
Reciting poetry with the Master.

33
00:04:41,159 --> 00:04:45,000
Our Miss loves to read books the most compared to most rich people.

34
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,329
And the richest among those who like to read.

35
00:04:48,329 --> 00:04:51,159
Even government officials come here.

36
00:04:51,159 --> 00:04:53,500
Bringing light to the name.

37
00:04:54,329 --> 00:04:59,000
You must be respectful.

38
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,829
Occasionally, there are power outages but don't be afraid

39
00:05:28,329 --> 00:05:30,500
I'll be sleeping in here?

40
00:05:31,329 --> 00:05:34,829
Miss Hideko is very ill and is easily awakened.

41
00:05:34,829 --> 00:05:36,329
The Mistress' room is over there?

42
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:06,329
Damn.

43
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:14,329
Mother.

44
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:23,160
Mother.

45
00:06:24,329 --> 00:06:28,159
Miss. Are you all right?

46
00:06:28,159 --> 00:06:30,500
Sun Ja. Is it you Sun Ja?

47
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:34,159
Sun Ja got fired. I am the new maid.

48
00:06:34,159 --> 00:06:37,500
You were having a nightmare?

49
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:41,000
See that cherry blossom tree over there?

50
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:46,000
My Aunt went mad and hung herself on it.

51
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,329
Occasionally, on dark nights

52
00:06:48,329 --> 00:06:50,159
her spirit can be seen.

53
00:06:50,159 --> 00:06:54,329
Just hanging there...

54
00:07:06,329 --> 00:07:09,160
Here. Drink this.

55
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,329
My Aunt

56
00:07:13,329 --> 00:07:17,829
Gave a bit of alcohol to babies that woke up in the middle of the night

57
00:07:37,159 --> 00:07:40,829
Is this the scent of clothes?

58
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:46,329
You think my actual name is Tamako...

59
00:07:46,329 --> 00:07:49,659
But my real name is Nam Sook Hee.

60
00:07:49,659 --> 00:07:53,500
Once I was born, I was given away to the silversmith shop of my father.

61
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:55,829
ah, no, my mother's

62
00:07:55,829 --> 00:08:00,160
When I was 5, I could already tell the difference between fake and real money.

63
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:03,329
Afterwards, I learned how to make fake signature stamps.

64
00:08:03,329 --> 00:08:07,660
and even picked up the art of stealing as well.

65
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:12,000
But these children are not to learn any of these skills.

66
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,329
They were abandoned right after birth.

67
00:08:14,329 --> 00:08:17,829
We wash, feed, then sell them off to Japan.

68
00:08:17,829 --> 00:08:19,829
Purposeful.

69
00:08:19,829 --> 00:08:21,329
If we hadn't taken them in they would've died of starvation,

70
00:08:21,329 --> 00:08:25,160
the best we can do is give them a chance to be a Miss or Count in a rich household.

71
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:28,159
Gguet Dan hates feeding the children her breastmilk.

72
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:30,330
If it were me, it'd be different.

73
00:08:30,330 --> 00:08:32,830
If only I had breastmilk,

74
00:08:32,830 --> 00:08:36,500
I'd feed each and every one of them till they're full.

75
00:09:16,330 --> 00:09:20,000
Today, I'll talk about this translator.

76
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:26,000
There's a person in Japan who purposely became a translator for government officials.

77
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
And of course, the pay was high.

78
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Enough to even buy a mine.

79
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,330
But now he wants to be a Japanese

80
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,159
After getting Japanese citizenship.

81
00:09:38,159 --> 00:09:41,830
He married the daughter of a disgraced aristocrat.

82
00:09:41,830 --> 00:09:45,659
He even adopted his wife's surname, Kouzuki.

83
00:09:46,159 --> 00:09:50,830
That... bastard...

84
00:09:50,830 --> 00:09:52,659
That bastard built a house

85
00:09:52,659 --> 00:09:56,330
After that, created a library filled with books and ancient artifacts.

86
00:09:57,500 --> 00:10:01,330
Many collectors gather there.

87
00:10:01,330 --> 00:10:03,500
And after holding the poetry recital,

88
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:05,830
the book is auctioned off.

89
00:10:05,830 --> 00:10:08,830
This man considers books and art to be as valuable as his life.

90
00:10:08,830 --> 00:10:10,659
But only few are sold.

91
00:10:10,659 --> 00:10:14,330
Even if he doesn't want to but has to sell them...

92
00:10:14,330 --> 00:10:17,159
he sells fakes.

93
00:10:19,159 --> 00:10:24,659
He's looking for someone to create counterfeits for him

94
00:10:24,659 --> 00:10:26,659
Not the sort that he has.

95
00:10:26,659 --> 00:10:30,000
Not only a real Japanese, but a aristocrat none the less.

96
00:10:31,330 --> 00:10:33,000
A Count.

97
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,159
And that Count will be I, Fujiwara.

98
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:40,000
And who will this be?

99
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:43,830
A woman. A Japanese woman.

100
00:10:44,659 --> 00:10:46,159
Who killed his wife?

101
00:10:46,159 --> 00:10:47,330
Is she pretty?

102
00:10:47,330 --> 00:10:50,830
Kouzuki's wife died before giving birth to any children.

103
00:10:50,830 --> 00:10:55,330
And the woman is his niece, the daughter of his dead wife's sister.

104
00:10:55,330 --> 00:10:56,830
The one that reads books...

105
00:10:56,830 --> 00:10:58,659
Is she pretty?

106
00:10:58,659 --> 00:10:59,659
She is an orphan.

107
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:01,500
An extremely wealthy orphan.

108
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:05,500
I will make her fall in love with me and we'll escape to Japan.

109
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:10,330
There, we will get married, and once she receives her inheritance

110
00:11:10,330 --> 00:11:14,500
I'll say that my wife has gone mad and have her locked in an insane asylum.

111
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:16,500
Got it.

112
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:19,830
-I want Sook Hee to be her maid.  -What?

113
00:11:19,830 --> 00:11:22,159
Every night to listen in on Hideko.

114
00:11:22,159 --> 00:11:24,500
and afterwards, relay everything to me.

115
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:26,330
Follow her every move all day

116
00:11:26,330 --> 00:11:30,000
and convince her to fall in love with me.

117
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,659
Love.

118
00:11:31,659 --> 00:11:34,159
A con-man still knows how to love?

119
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:41,000
And the money?

120
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,330
Is she definitely rich?

121
00:11:43,330 --> 00:11:47,659
Every night before sleeping, I remember the amount money.

122
00:11:47,659 --> 00:11:51,159
1,500,000 in cash, 300,000 in bonds.

123
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:55,500
He's an uncle merely by title

124
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:57,000
The inheritance all belongs to Hideko

125
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:01,330
Which is why Kouzuki plans to marry Hideko.

126
00:12:01,659 --> 00:12:03,830
To marry his own niece? What a...

127
00:12:03,830 --> 00:12:07,000
Bastard.

128
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:11,830
And how much will we get?

129
00:12:12,330 --> 00:12:14,159
I will give you people 50,000.

130
00:12:14,159 --> 00:12:17,000
Sook Hee can also take Hideko's jewelry and clothes as well.

131
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Let me do it! Let me do it!

132
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:23,159
I know Japanese and am experienced in being a maid.

133
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Fine, 50,000 accepted.

134
00:12:39,830 --> 00:12:44,500
Besides the jewelry and clothes, I want 10,000 on top of that.

135
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:46,659
Is she crazy?

136
00:12:46,659 --> 00:12:47,830
Who's saying I'm crazy?

137
00:12:47,830 --> 00:12:49,659
It's not like that.

138
00:12:49,659 --> 00:12:53,000
I want to make a big catch then leave Korea.

139
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:58,500
I have to bear with these country maids.

140
00:13:13,830 --> 00:13:17,330
Ah, damn it.

141
00:13:18,830 --> 00:13:20,500
This is Tamako.

142
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:22,000
I am at your service.

143
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,330
Miss...

144
00:13:25,659 --> 00:13:27,659
Damn.

145
00:13:28,830 --> 00:13:32,159
He should've told me she was so pretty.

146
00:13:32,159 --> 00:13:34,659
She's got me completely flustered.

147
00:13:35,330 --> 00:13:36,659
This is a reference letter

148
00:13:36,659 --> 00:13:40,500
from Lady Minami, my last mistress.

149
00:13:41,830 --> 00:13:44,830
This is Lady Minami's reference letter. Listen carefully.

150
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:49,159
Dear Miss Izumi Hideko,

151
00:13:49,159 --> 00:13:51,830
Count Fujiwara has informed me

152
00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:54,659
you are in need of a new maid.

153
00:13:54,659 --> 00:13:58,000
A maid is like a pair of chopsticks.

154
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:03,000
When its' presence is there it's ignored, but when its not really there you feel something missing.

155
00:14:04,159 --> 00:14:07,659
Do you like this place?

156
00:14:07,659 --> 00:14:10,830
This place is somber, there's barely any sunlight.

157
00:14:10,830 --> 00:14:13,330
because Uncle won't permit it.

158
00:14:13,330 --> 00:14:16,159
Sunlight causes books to fade.

159
00:14:16,159 --> 00:14:20,159
You probably wouldn't like a dark and somber place like this.

160
00:14:23,830 --> 00:14:26,799
Do you not have any formality?

161
00:14:26,799 --> 00:14:29,830
I'll take my leave.

162
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:47,000
I always get headaches when it's time for me to read.

163
00:14:49,659 --> 00:14:51,659
Help me read this.

164
00:14:52,330 --> 00:14:54,159
What?

165
00:15:03,159 --> 00:15:04,500
My goodness, thank you

166
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:06,159
Lady Minami

167
00:15:06,159 --> 00:15:08,659
has praised me so well.

168
00:15:08,659 --> 00:15:10,330
Is that so?

169
00:15:12,830 --> 00:15:15,330
Miss you are Japanese.

170
00:15:15,330 --> 00:15:18,159
But why aren't you speaking Japanese?

171
00:15:18,159 --> 00:15:19,500
It's a bother.

172
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:23,330
All the books Uncle makes me read are in Japanese.

173
00:15:23,659 --> 00:15:26,500
So help read it for me.

174
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:40,659
Dear Miss Izumi Hideko,

175
00:15:40,659 --> 00:15:43,159
Count Fujiwara has informed me

176
00:15:43,159 --> 00:15:45,159
you are in need of a new maid.

177
00:15:45,159 --> 00:15:50,330
Maids are like spoons... an I mean...

178
00:15:50,330 --> 00:15:53,830
like chopsticks....

179
00:15:57,330 --> 00:16:00,159
Or is it spoons?

180
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,659
I don't know how to read, Miss.

181
00:16:13,659 --> 00:16:14,830
At all?

182
00:16:14,830 --> 00:16:17,330
What about the Korean alphabet?

183
00:16:40,659 --> 00:16:42,500
This is your name.

184
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:44,500
Don't know your name either?

185
00:16:50,159 --> 00:16:52,330
You can learn the alphabet.

186
00:16:52,330 --> 00:16:56,330
You can even curse at me or steal things from me.

187
00:16:58,159 --> 00:17:00,160
But please don't lie to me.

188
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:01,160
Understand?

189
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:03,329
Yes, Mistress.

190
00:17:07,329 --> 00:17:09,329
It's my mother.

191
00:17:11,329 --> 00:17:14,660
What a very beautiful lady!

192
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:15,660
What about me?

193
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:18,160
Am I also beautiful?

194
00:17:19,329 --> 00:17:23,329
Everyone tells me I'm not as beautiful as my mother.

195
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:29,660
I heard from Count Fujiwara...

196
00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:32,160
You've met him before?

197
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:33,000
What?

198
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,500
No, I haven't.

199
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:36,329
But my aunt...

200
00:17:36,329 --> 00:17:38,500
She's the one who told me.

201
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:41,329
My Aunt was his nanny.

202
00:17:41,329 --> 00:17:44,660
What has he said about me?

203
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:53,329
He says that he can't help but think of your beautiful face before sleeping.

204
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Why does he think about it before sleeping?

205
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,500
What happened to your feet?

206
00:18:10,329 --> 00:18:12,660
I don't have anywhere to go.

207
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:17,000
When I moved to Korean when I was 5, I never left.

208
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:23,000
But if you wear new shoes, the steps you take are all the same.

209
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:28,000
These shoes seem to fit you.

210
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:36,000
It's time for me to go practice.

211
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:37,829
I'll go alone.

212
00:18:37,829 --> 00:18:39,000
What?

213
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,660
It's still raining.

214
00:18:56,329 --> 00:18:59,829
At noon, come knock on the door.

215
00:18:59,829 --> 00:19:01,829
Understand?

216
00:19:04,329 --> 00:19:06,160
See you late-

217
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,660
What are these?

218
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,829
This is....

219
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:02,000
The former Mistress' house is so big. Why would she?

220
00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:12,329
Maybe the house was too big so she went insane?

221
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:53,000
My new maid.

222
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:55,660
Snake... Snake.

223
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:04,000
Don't take another step.

224
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,329
You need to remember.

225
00:21:06,329 --> 00:21:10,000
The snake is the limit.

226
00:21:17,329 --> 00:21:19,329
A snake.

227
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:25,329
The Count?

228
00:21:25,329 --> 00:21:27,160
Today?

229
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:32,829
So that's why you told me to go bathe.

230
00:21:32,829 --> 00:21:39,000
My aunt said when you hear that guests will come, drop everything and go bathe the children.

231
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:44,160
The guests like the smell of a clean baby.

232
00:21:44,660 --> 00:21:48,660
Miss, you are my baby.

233
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:52,329
My aunt also said, give the babies candy when they bathe.

234
00:21:52,329 --> 00:21:55,160
To teach them that bath time is sweet.

235
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:56,829
What's wrong?

236
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,500
One of my teeth is sharp.

237
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:02,000
It keeps cutting me.

238
00:22:20,829 --> 00:22:22,500
Ah

239
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:49,660
So this was the scent.

240
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:50,160
It's smooth now.

241
00:23:55,660 --> 00:23:57,660
Hurry. Hurry.

242
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:06,500
Welcome.

243
00:24:15,329 --> 00:24:17,829
Inviting me to the living room immediately as I arrive

244
00:24:17,829 --> 00:24:19,500
this is really too cordial

245
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:20,829
Due to traveling

246
00:24:20,829 --> 00:24:23,000
I dressed comfortably.

247
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,829
But don't worry,

248
00:24:24,829 --> 00:24:26,329
during our painting lessons,

249
00:24:26,329 --> 00:24:30,160
I will dress properly.

250
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:33,660
Are you Tamako?

251
00:24:33,660 --> 00:24:37,000
Yes Count, please take good care of me.

252
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,660
It'll be hard for me to deal with you if you disservice me.

253
00:24:39,660 --> 00:24:41,829
Understand?

254
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,660
For a Korean

255
00:24:44,660 --> 00:24:47,500
you don't look so bad.

256
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:48,329
So...

257
00:24:48,329 --> 00:24:52,160
Will you fulfill your duty?

258
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,160
Count Fujiwara

259
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:07,829
calls for your maid Tamako

260
00:25:07,829 --> 00:25:10,160
to help him do something.

261
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:13,000
He asks you if it is alright?

262
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:22,660
You were looking for me, Count?

263
00:25:22,660 --> 00:25:24,660
Come in.

264
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:58,000
People back home miss you a lot.

265
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:01,500
Saying Sook-Hee will become a better conman than her mother.

266
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:04,160
Who'd believe words from a lying conman like you?

267
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:08,500
It seems you and I have gotten closer, so whenever I make a move

268
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:10,829
come meet me separately

269
00:26:10,829 --> 00:26:12,829
Understand?

270
00:26:12,829 --> 00:26:18,829
The Mistress is so naive, if someone were to pull her nipple she wouldn't even know it.

271
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:22,000
Which is why you're at her side to help.

272
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,660
You need to remind that this is for me.

273
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:28,329
"Ever since the Count's arrival

274
00:26:28,329 --> 00:26:31,160
your toenails have grown long so fast."

275
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:33,500
Talk and use those sorts of methods ok?

276
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:36,329
Here. A gift.

277
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:51,329
Oh my, how pretty.

278
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,160
<i>After all, once you get sent to the asylum,</i>

279
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:55,660
<i>all these shall be mine.</i>

280
00:26:55,660 --> 00:26:59,160
<i>Looking at you like this makes me feel uncomfortable</i>

281
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:02,660
Have you ever seen such blue sapphires?

282
00:27:05,660 --> 00:27:08,160
Let's see

283
00:27:09,329 --> 00:27:13,829
This is not sapphire... but spinel.

284
00:27:16,329 --> 00:27:19,500
It's alright though, Miss. Spinel is quite expensive too.

285
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:22,000
How do you know it's spinel...

286
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:27,000
My Aunt... I mean... Lady Minami taught me

287
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,500
But it's alright.

288
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:30,329
You shouldn't feel embarrassed.

289
00:27:30,329 --> 00:27:33,000
Jewelers would get confused between both too.

290
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,829
Is that so?

291
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:52,160
<i>Of all the clothes I've washed and help her worn</i>

292
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:54,829
<i>is there any prettier than this?</i>

293
00:27:56,660 --> 00:28:00,000
<i>How nice would it be to let the rest have a look.</i>

294
00:28:00,660 --> 00:28:02,160
<i>I really want everyone to see. I wonder what they'll say?</i>

295
00:28:04,329 --> 00:28:06,160
<i>They'll probably say...</i>

296
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:09,859
So attractive.

297
00:28:09,859 --> 00:28:12,000
Too... too wonderful.

298
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,160
Simply magnificent.

299
00:28:20,329 --> 00:28:22,660
<i>Shameless bastard.</i>

300
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,660
M-M-Magnificent.

301
00:28:27,660 --> 00:28:31,329
I... I... I don"t know what to do.

302
00:28:31,329 --> 00:28:33,000
I will even stutter like this.

303
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:36,160
and blush.

304
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:38,329
Only then will those rich fools believe.

305
00:28:38,329 --> 00:28:40,660
Prepare to put your heart into it.

306
00:28:40,660 --> 00:28:42,500
Do you understand?

307
00:28:42,829 --> 00:28:43,829
Let's try

308
00:28:47,029 --> 00:28:49,430
One. Two. Three.

309
00:28:52,660 --> 00:28:57,000
Its all the Count's fault, he kept pouring wine and telling me to drink.

310
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:05,000
How do you feel?

311
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:06,500
It's very tight.

312
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:08,829
Miss, how did you survive wearing this?

313
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:10,829
You think this feels tight?

314
00:29:12,829 --> 00:29:14,500
Miss. I'm gonna die!

315
00:29:18,329 --> 00:29:19,160
Looking like this,

316
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:21,329
you could pass as a Lady.

317
00:29:25,829 --> 00:29:28,829
The Count said something...

318
00:29:28,829 --> 00:29:30,829
which I think I understand now.

319
00:29:32,660 --> 00:29:34,329
Your face....

320
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:40,829
Every time before I sleep, I always remember.

321
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,160
Mistress. You really....

322
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:57,000
<i>She's like a porcelain doll.</i>

323
00:29:57,500 --> 00:29:59,660
<i>So many buttons</i>

324
00:29:59,660 --> 00:30:02,000
<i>is to let me elated about taking this off?</i>

325
00:30:02,829 --> 00:30:06,160
<i>Unbutton it, pull the string...</i>

326
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:11,000
<i>You'll see something</i>

327
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:14,329
<i> so sweet and supple.</i>

328
00:30:15,660 --> 00:30:17,160
<i>If I were a thief</i>

329
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:21,160
<i>I would've already be reaching to caress it.</i>

330
00:30:53,329 --> 00:30:58,000
Miss, must you really marry your Uncle?

331
00:31:00,829 --> 00:31:02,329
He raised me for this reason.

332
00:31:02,329 --> 00:31:05,329
He knew sooner or later one day will need my inheritance.

333
00:31:05,829 --> 00:31:08,160
There's a famous collector from France

334
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:11,660
who says he plans to auction off his library in a few days

335
00:31:11,660 --> 00:31:12,660
If successful,

336
00:31:12,660 --> 00:31:14,829
the income from his gold mines are far from enough

337
00:31:15,660 --> 00:31:18,000
If it was me.

338
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:21,329
<i>I would sell all the books and buy gold, not sell gold and buy books.</i>

339
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:56,829
<i>Right now, the Miss...</i>

340
00:31:56,829 --> 00:32:02,000
<i>doesn't want to recite poetry in front of the bastard trying to get her inheritance.</i>

341
00:32:03,329 --> 00:32:08,160
<i>The Count is making counterfeits</i>

342
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:14,160
<i>The Miss is waiting till 2 to begin her art lessons.</i>

343
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:18,160
<i>She waits and waits.</i>

344
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:21,660
<i>What a pity...</i>

345
00:32:21,660 --> 00:32:24,160
<i>To think a fake Count like him can steal her heart</i>

346
00:32:58,829 --> 00:33:00,160
Count

347
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:54,500
I'm very sorry.

348
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:56,329
It's alright.

349
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,500
This peach....

350
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:08,329
should I redraw it and make it look more realistic?

351
00:34:08,329 --> 00:34:10,829
Realistic?

352
00:34:10,829 --> 00:34:15,000
Only if you stop looking at it as a plain object

353
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:19,000
Meaning perspective must be considered

354
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:24,329
For example, the peach is very juicy

355
00:34:24,329 --> 00:34:26,829
Right in front of you, you're afraid

356
00:34:26,829 --> 00:34:29,159
seeing the deeper meaning penetrate your inner most thoughts

357
00:34:37,659 --> 00:34:40,000
Let's stop here for today.

358
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,159
Seems its ripe.

359
00:34:48,659 --> 00:34:49,829
That fast?

360
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:55,829
Damn.

361
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:00,829
Do you know?

362
00:35:00,829 --> 00:35:04,659
That ever since the Count's arrival, you've began to blush more often?

363
00:35:04,659 --> 00:35:06,159
Me?

364
00:35:12,159 --> 00:35:14,829
How did your mother pass away?

365
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,329
Not long after giving birth to me.

366
00:35:18,329 --> 00:35:21,000
She went and hun-

367
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,659
Ah no...

368
00:35:22,659 --> 00:35:25,659
Hung herself? Like my aunt.

369
00:35:25,659 --> 00:35:28,000
Yes, that's right.

370
00:35:35,159 --> 00:35:38,659
But before she passed away, she must've often hugged you.

371
00:35:38,659 --> 00:35:40,500
Right?

372
00:35:43,829 --> 00:35:48,159
My mother passed away shortly after giving birth to me.

373
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:57,159
That's why it's no different than me killing her.

374
00:35:57,829 --> 00:36:00,829
It would've been better if I wasn't born.

375
00:36:04,829 --> 00:36:08,159
It's not a child's fault for being born

376
00:36:08,159 --> 00:36:10,500
If she was still here

377
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:14,000
your mother would say

378
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:18,329
"I'm so lucky to have given birth to you before I died"

379
00:36:18,329 --> 00:36:20,829
"I'm not burdened at all"

380
00:36:26,159 --> 00:36:30,500
Did my mother cry before getting hanged?

381
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:32,159
Your mother.

382
00:36:32,159 --> 00:36:35,829
has stolen a thousand times and only got caught once.

383
00:36:35,829 --> 00:36:39,000
And because of that, died.

384
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,500
You ask if she cried?

385
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:47,829
No, she laughed.

386
00:36:47,829 --> 00:36:51,000
Said she was very lucky to have been able to give birth to you before dying.

387
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,329
I wasn't burdened at all.

388
00:37:00,329 --> 00:37:02,329
Please sit here for a bit.

389
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:04,829
I will go and pick mushrooms.

390
00:37:06,829 --> 00:37:08,829
I'll make you hotpot tonight.

391
00:37:08,829 --> 00:37:09,829
You don't like hotpot?

392
00:37:09,829 --> 00:37:11,329
Let me come too.

393
00:37:12,329 --> 00:37:14,329
I'll be back soon.

394
00:37:14,829 --> 00:37:16,159
Before the rain.

395
00:37:25,329 --> 00:37:26,829
Well done.

396
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:33,500
Oh, what a coincidence.

397
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:37,000
May I sit?

398
00:38:04,329 --> 00:38:06,829
<i>The Miss is sitting so shyly.</i>

399
00:38:06,829 --> 00:38:10,500
<i>This conman is taking advantage of her.</i>

400
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:12,829
<i>The servants leave</i>

401
00:38:12,829 --> 00:38:15,500
<i>to give the two privacy</i>

402
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:18,329
<i>The plan is going well, Sook-Hee.</i>

403
00:38:18,329 --> 00:38:21,659
Everyone is playing their part.

404
00:38:23,659 --> 00:38:25,159
Damn.

405
00:38:30,159 --> 00:38:32,829
You know, servants can't go in and out as they please!

406
00:38:41,329 --> 00:38:42,500
Hey.

407
00:38:47,829 --> 00:38:51,829
It would've been better if I hadn't come here.

408
00:38:53,159 --> 00:38:55,500
I shouldn't have come here.

409
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:57,829
Tamako.

410
00:38:57,829 --> 00:39:00,500
Are Hideko's paints ready?

411
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:02,500
Of course Count.

412
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:04,159
The watercolor and everything is...

413
00:39:04,159 --> 00:39:06,329
Go change it to oil paint instead.

414
00:39:06,329 --> 00:39:10,000
The weather today is suitable for oil painting.

415
00:39:55,329 --> 00:39:57,329
There's a power outage, bring the lamps here.

416
00:39:57,329 --> 00:39:59,000
Yes. Right away.

417
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,000
Hurry.

418
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:08,000
<i>I need to remind myself</i>

419
00:40:08,329 --> 00:40:10,659
<i>that I want to be rich.</i>

420
00:40:10,659 --> 00:40:13,000
<i>and then travel somewhere far</i>

421
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,000
<i>eat foreign foods,</i>

422
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:18,329
<i>buy bright shiny things and...</i>

423
00:40:18,329 --> 00:40:21,329
<i>most importantly</i>

424
00:40:21,329 --> 00:40:23,159
<i>Forget about Hideko.</i>

425
00:40:51,329 --> 00:40:54,659
You didn't even notice or care to check up on me?

426
00:40:54,659 --> 00:40:56,500
It was late so I went to sleep.

427
00:40:56,500 --> 00:40:58,659
I'm sorry Mistress.

428
00:40:59,159 --> 00:41:02,829
Did you know reciting takes a lot of energy and effort?

429
00:41:02,829 --> 00:41:07,000
The makeup, changing clothes, all done by myself

430
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,500
I think I might have a nightmare. Sleep here by my side.

431
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,000
He proposed to me.

432
00:41:40,159 --> 00:41:43,000
He said the 15th of this month...

433
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,659
when Uncle will be away

434
00:41:45,659 --> 00:41:48,829
We'll run away to Japan.

435
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,500
How did you reply?

436
00:41:54,659 --> 00:41:56,659
I said I don't know.

437
00:41:56,659 --> 00:41:58,159
Why?

438
00:41:58,159 --> 00:42:00,159
Because I'm afraid.

439
00:42:00,159 --> 00:42:03,159
Afraid that your uncle will be angry?

440
00:42:04,159 --> 00:42:07,829
Afraid of the Count.

441
00:42:07,829 --> 00:42:11,829
What is there to be afraid of? He's so kind.

442
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,659
I don't even know, I just feel that...

443
00:42:19,329 --> 00:42:23,500
When he caresses my cheek, my face becomes really warm.

444
00:42:25,829 --> 00:42:28,159
Really?

445
00:42:35,500 --> 00:42:39,500
What does a man really want?

446
00:42:41,159 --> 00:42:42,829
What?

447
00:42:43,500 --> 00:42:48,829
What I mean is... The wedding night...

448
00:42:50,829 --> 00:42:52,500
How would I know?

449
00:42:52,500 --> 00:42:56,000
I grew up without a mother to teach me.

450
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,500
I have no idea about any of this.

451
00:43:03,659 --> 00:43:09,329
Probably kissing first?

452
00:43:11,329 --> 00:43:13,159
Alright.

453
00:43:13,159 --> 00:43:15,659
<i>Let's try to put her to sleep</i>

454
00:43:17,829 --> 00:43:19,000
<i>So adorable</i>

455
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,159
<i>In a foreign country and without a mother</i>

456
00:43:21,159 --> 00:43:23,500
<i>Alone in this giant mansion</i>

457
00:43:23,500 --> 00:43:26,000
<i>Reading useless books</i>

458
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:29,000
<i>And learning nothing of value.</i>

459
00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:49,829
Why did the taste change?

460
00:43:49,829 --> 00:43:53,329
Sour and bitter.

461
00:43:53,329 --> 00:43:57,000
Within the bitterness changes to sweetness.

462
00:43:57,139 --> 00:44:00,659
Sweet with a nice scent.

463
00:44:00,659 --> 00:44:02,329
How do you know?

464
00:44:03,500 --> 00:44:06,000
Have you done this before?

465
00:44:07,829 --> 00:44:11,500
Nope not at all, my friend showed me this.

466
00:44:11,500 --> 00:44:14,000
Showed you? By describing?

467
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,500
Yes, by describing.

468
00:44:35,659 --> 00:44:37,659
So this is the feeling.

469
00:44:37,659 --> 00:44:41,500
This is what the Count wants.

470
00:44:41,500 --> 00:44:43,159
Really?

471
00:44:43,159 --> 00:44:46,829
The Count...

472
00:44:47,829 --> 00:44:51,659
Would it be like being with a corpse?

473
00:44:52,659 --> 00:44:55,659
You know, my hands and legs cold?

474
00:44:55,659 --> 00:44:57,329
Is that so?

475
00:44:57,659 --> 00:44:59,329
Do you want to feel it?

476
00:45:07,329 --> 00:45:09,500
I just feel relieved.

477
00:45:09,500 --> 00:45:11,329
Relief?

478
00:45:12,329 --> 00:45:15,329
Do it to me, I want to personally know if it's relieving.

479
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:24,659
The Count will want to do this too.

480
00:45:24,659 --> 00:45:26,000
And also...

481
00:45:32,659 --> 00:45:34,500
So cute

482
00:45:37,329 --> 00:45:40,659
If the Count see's this...

483
00:45:49,500 --> 00:45:52,829
Will he be as gentle as you?

484
00:45:53,329 --> 00:45:58,000
Of course, the Count will also...

485
00:45:58,000 --> 00:45:59,829
also...

486
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,329
Continue. Just like that, as if the Count was doing it.

487
00:46:08,329 --> 00:46:11,659
After that, he would say...

488
00:46:13,829 --> 00:46:17,000
<i>"How soft and warm."</i>

489
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:20,659
So...

490
00:46:20,949 --> 00:46:23,159
So wet...

491
00:46:23,159 --> 00:46:26,329
Your beauty leaves me breathless.

492
00:46:47,159 --> 00:46:48,659
Ok Ju.

493
00:46:49,829 --> 00:46:55,500
Hideko.

494
00:46:55,500 --> 00:46:59,659
Mother.

495
00:46:59,659 --> 00:47:02,500
Father.

496
00:47:03,659 --> 00:47:06,659
A model should not move.

497
00:47:07,159 --> 00:47:11,659
Ok Ju.

498
00:47:14,659 --> 00:47:19,829
- Hideko. - Wait....

499
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:22,500
Please stop it.

500
00:47:22,500 --> 00:47:24,659
<i>Dont you dare touch her you filthy conman.</i>

501
00:47:26,159 --> 00:47:27,159
Stop.

502
00:47:27,159 --> 00:47:28,500
I can't paint anymore.

503
00:47:32,500 --> 00:47:34,000
Come over here, Tamako.

504
00:47:37,829 --> 00:47:39,500
How about you find something to do somewhere else?

505
00:47:39,500 --> 00:47:42,000
I think you understand.

506
00:47:50,659 --> 00:47:52,829
I don't need to go anywhere else

507
00:47:52,829 --> 00:47:56,159
My duty is to look after the Mistress.

508
00:48:07,659 --> 00:48:09,000
Do you not know when to stop?

509
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:10,659
It's all because of you.

510
00:48:10,659 --> 00:48:12,829
I'm all hot and bothered.

511
00:48:12,829 --> 00:48:15,159
It'll all be over when it's the 15th.

512
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,329
Do you know, how much I thirst for her?

513
00:48:18,329 --> 00:48:20,829
Because I want to change my life,

514
00:48:20,829 --> 00:48:23,329
I've put so much effort in.

515
00:48:23,329 --> 00:48:25,829
You think I'll just stand here and watch you turn it all to waste?

516
00:48:25,829 --> 00:48:27,000
You bitch.

517
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,500
Do you want me to tell the Miss everything?

518
00:48:29,500 --> 00:48:31,329
To let her know that you're really a thief?

519
00:48:31,329 --> 00:48:32,159
and just faking to be her friend?

520
00:48:32,159 --> 00:48:35,659
Fine. Then why don't you expose yourself too

521
00:48:35,659 --> 00:48:38,159
You're not at all an aristocrat

522
00:48:38,159 --> 00:48:40,500
But a peasant from Jeju.

523
00:48:40,500 --> 00:48:43,829
Think of your people.

524
00:48:43,829 --> 00:48:47,659
Looking after the children, growing older by the day.

525
00:48:47,659 --> 00:48:50,329
If you fail, they'll be extremely disappointed.

526
00:48:50,329 --> 00:48:52,159
Do you want to be like your mother?

527
00:48:52,159 --> 00:48:55,159
Don't you have to find money to take care of them?

528
00:48:59,659 --> 00:49:03,329
From here on, don't you dare touch Hideko.

529
00:49:03,329 --> 00:49:05,000
She doesn't know anything that goes on between man and woman.

530
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:09,329
If she get's scared, you'll never get your chance.

531
00:49:11,159 --> 00:49:13,159
And also,

532
00:49:14,159 --> 00:49:15,159
stop shoving things...

533
00:49:15,159 --> 00:49:17,329
so small like that...

534
00:49:17,329 --> 00:49:19,329
into my hands.

535
00:49:28,159 --> 00:49:29,159
Hey.

536
00:49:29,829 --> 00:49:31,659
Ever since the Count came,

537
00:49:31,659 --> 00:49:33,000
your toenails have grown fast.

538
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:34,829
It must be because you're very excited.

539
00:49:35,829 --> 00:49:40,659
Miss, would you like to know something?

540
00:49:40,659 --> 00:49:44,500
On the sea, boats pass by each other all the time

541
00:49:44,500 --> 00:49:47,329
Coming and going.

542
00:49:47,329 --> 00:49:50,159
Someone to meet you, someone to give money.

543
00:49:50,159 --> 00:49:52,659
Where's the furthest place you've been to?

544
00:49:52,659 --> 00:49:54,500
Is it behind the mountain?

545
00:50:00,159 --> 00:50:02,159
I think if this were to continue, it would be amazing.

546
00:50:02,159 --> 00:50:05,329
Being by your side.

547
00:50:05,329 --> 00:50:07,829
You're very lucky Miss.

548
00:50:07,829 --> 00:50:09,329
Not only do men like you,

549
00:50:09,329 --> 00:50:11,659
But also have the ability to protect you.

550
00:50:11,659 --> 00:50:14,159
These kinds of things are rare.

551
00:50:14,159 --> 00:50:19,500
I don't know if I really love him.

552
00:50:19,829 --> 00:50:21,500
You do love him.

553
00:50:24,829 --> 00:50:26,659
How do you know that?

554
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:31,159
You look out the window.

555
00:50:31,159 --> 00:50:35,829
You shift and sigh when you sleep.

556
00:50:35,829 --> 00:50:37,659
And your toenails...

557
00:50:37,659 --> 00:50:40,500
Even though I don't consider that as love...

558
00:50:40,500 --> 00:50:44,829
I love someone else, not him...

559
00:50:44,829 --> 00:50:49,829
You've never felt that someone as dependent as me....

560
00:50:49,829 --> 00:50:53,659
would marry him and be happy?

561
00:50:56,159 --> 00:50:57,829
You'll definitely fall in love with him.

562
00:51:13,500 --> 00:51:14,500
Mistress.

563
00:51:21,659 --> 00:51:24,329
<i>Hideko finally accepted the proposal but with a request...</i>

564
00:51:24,329 --> 00:51:27,000
<i>that I will accompany her to Japan as well.</i>

565
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,000
<i>The Count's expression looked troubled</i>

566
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:32,329
<i>but agreed nevertheless.</i>

567
00:51:33,159 --> 00:51:35,159
<i>The day Uncle left,</i>

568
00:51:35,159 --> 00:51:37,659
Count also made a ruse, pretending to go back to Japan.

569
00:51:37,659 --> 00:51:40,000
But in reality, hid somewhere near.

570
00:51:52,659 --> 00:51:56,329
You have a week of freedom.

571
00:51:56,329 --> 00:52:01,000
But you must remember the thing in the cellar.

572
00:52:46,829 --> 00:52:47,659
Miss.

573
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:36,329
We are very honored to have you

574
00:53:36,829 --> 00:53:39,159
pick our boat.

575
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,329
We should arrive around...

576
00:53:42,329 --> 00:53:45,159
7:30 pm.

577
00:53:52,500 --> 00:53:54,000
At last have reach home.

578
00:53:54,329 --> 00:53:55,829
It's been 3 years, I miss it so much.

579
00:54:04,159 --> 00:54:04,829
Sorry.

580
00:54:47,659 --> 00:54:50,000
You may not steal.

581
00:54:50,329 --> 00:54:52,159
You may not steal.

582
00:54:52,159 --> 00:54:56,329
No sex before marriage.

583
00:54:57,000 --> 00:55:01,159
You may not commit adultery.

584
00:56:33,659 --> 00:56:35,829
Were you able to sleep?

585
00:56:45,829 --> 00:56:46,659
Please wait a sec.

586
00:56:47,500 --> 00:56:49,000
I'm sorry.

587
00:56:53,829 --> 00:56:56,829
The Count bribed the temple owner to keep an eye on us.

588
00:56:57,159 --> 00:56:59,329
Afraid that we'll run away.

589
00:56:59,329 --> 00:57:00,659
Why are you dressing up?

590
00:57:00,659 --> 00:57:02,329
Theres nothing to do anyways.

591
00:57:04,659 --> 00:57:06,329
<i>Everything's going so slowly.</i>

592
00:57:06,500 --> 00:57:10,329
<i>I'm afraid that Hideko will go mad, what should I do?</i>

593
00:57:10,659 --> 00:57:12,829
<i>Maybe we'll play dress up again</i>

594
00:57:16,500 --> 00:57:19,659
<i>I haven't seen the Count at all.</i>

595
00:57:20,659 --> 00:57:24,829
<u>Unless he went to make the marriage official, and collect the inheritance...</u>

596
00:57:24,829 --> 00:57:26,000
<i>Why does he need to do so much?</i>

597
00:57:56,500 --> 00:57:58,000
What took you so long?

598
00:57:58,329 --> 00:58:01,659
You can't just half-ass the job.

599
00:58:01,659 --> 00:58:03,500
What do you want me to do?

600
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:07,500
You've got the main part done, why don't we throw her into an asylum?

601
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:16,329
We've stayed here for one week.

602
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:20,000
At last...

603
00:59:05,159 --> 00:59:06,500
Over here.

604
00:59:17,829 --> 00:59:19,829
Who is that person?

605
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:23,659
She is Count Fujiwara's wife.

606
00:59:23,659 --> 00:59:26,829
Before marriage, she was Miss Hideko.

607
00:59:28,329 --> 00:59:30,000
Then who are you?

608
00:59:30,329 --> 00:59:31,829
I am her maid.

609
00:59:32,659 --> 00:59:35,329
So Tamako

610
00:59:36,159 --> 00:59:38,659
do you think she needs treatment?

611
00:59:53,329 --> 00:59:56,500
Don't let anyone harm the Miss.

612
00:59:56,500 --> 01:00:00,500
I think it's best to let her stay somewhere where no one will harm her

613
01:00:00,500 --> 01:00:02,659
It's the only way.

614
01:00:04,500 --> 01:00:05,829
They'll only do a couple tests

615
01:00:05,829 --> 01:00:09,159
We'll eat lambchops tonight at the Peace Hotel

616
01:00:23,829 --> 01:00:25,659
We're almost done, you have worked hard.

617
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:30,159
Don't be afraid.

618
01:01:05,159 --> 01:01:07,329
Hello Miss.

619
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:10,329
Do you still remember me?

620
01:01:13,329 --> 01:01:14,659
Miss.

621
01:01:23,659 --> 01:01:25,000
What are you people doing?

622
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:28,000
We aren't harming you Miss.

623
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:30,329
But taking care of you.

624
01:01:31,500 --> 01:01:32,829
You've got the wrong person.

625
01:01:32,829 --> 01:01:35,500
That is Count Fujiwara's wife.

626
01:01:36,159 --> 01:01:38,659
Count, say something!

627
01:01:39,659 --> 01:01:44,000
You think you're the maid?

628
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:48,329
After all, she was raised by someone like the maid.

629
01:01:49,329 --> 01:01:50,829
Son of a bitch.

630
01:01:52,500 --> 01:01:54,500
You bastard. Damn you all.

631
01:01:54,500 --> 01:01:57,329
You can't say those things here.

632
01:01:57,329 --> 01:01:59,829
Miss.

633
01:02:04,159 --> 01:02:06,329
My poor Miss..

634
01:02:06,329 --> 01:02:08,659
has gone absolutely mad.

635
01:02:09,500 --> 01:02:11,659
I'm not sure if it may help,

636
01:02:11,659 --> 01:02:13,829
but this is her mother's

637
01:02:13,829 --> 01:02:16,829
most treasured possession

638
01:02:18,159 --> 01:02:20,659
when she was sane.

639
01:02:24,500 --> 01:02:27,329
This maid is quite thoughtful.

640
01:02:29,329 --> 01:02:32,329
At the start I thought Hideko was naive.

641
01:02:33,159 --> 01:02:34,829
Pftt. Naive?

642
01:02:36,659 --> 01:02:40,159
Miss Hideko...

643
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:45,000
from the beginning, she was...

644
01:02:45,659 --> 01:02:46,829
Miss

645
01:02:47,659 --> 01:02:49,329
a bad woman.

646
01:02:51,159 --> 01:02:52,500
Miss.

647
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:58,159
I'm not a bad girl. I'm not a bad girl.

648
01:02:59,159 --> 01:03:00,829
No. Don't. No.

649
01:03:08,159 --> 01:03:10,159
Put on inside the mouth Hideko.

650
01:03:13,500 --> 01:03:15,000
Put your hand out.

651
01:03:37,829 --> 01:03:40,659
If you still want to talk back,

652
01:03:41,159 --> 01:03:44,500
think of the taste of these bells!

653
01:03:50,829 --> 01:03:54,000
From today onwards, you shall sleep here.

654
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:04,829
Why?

655
01:04:04,829 --> 01:04:06,159
Help me light the lamp.

656
01:04:06,659 --> 01:04:10,159
We have to conserve oil.

657
01:04:10,500 --> 01:04:12,159
What an annoying brat.

658
01:04:12,329 --> 01:04:13,829
Speak Japanese!

659
01:04:16,659 --> 01:04:20,000
In there, is a demon...

660
01:04:20,500 --> 01:04:22,500
what he hates the most...

661
01:04:22,500 --> 01:04:24,500
are obnoxious brats.

662
01:04:25,159 --> 01:04:29,000
If you continue to pester, he will come out.

663
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:31,500
And what will happen after that?

664
01:04:34,829 --> 01:04:38,829
Use his huge body to press on you Miss.

665
01:04:39,659 --> 01:04:41,829
You won't be able to speak another word...

666
01:04:56,329 --> 01:04:57,500
Aunt.

667
01:04:58,159 --> 01:04:59,500
tsk

668
01:05:01,329 --> 01:05:04,329
You only know how to scare kids

669
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:55,659
And I?

670
01:05:56,829 --> 01:05:59,000
Very pretty. I am also very pretty.

671
01:06:02,500 --> 01:06:04,159
Look carefully...

672
01:06:09,159 --> 01:06:12,329
Everyone says I...

673
01:06:13,500 --> 01:06:16,159
am not as pretty as my sister.

674
01:06:18,500 --> 01:06:19,659
Daytime.

675
01:06:19,659 --> 01:06:21,000
Night.

676
01:06:21,329 --> 01:06:22,329
Daytime.

677
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:23,659
Night.

678
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:25,829
Man.

679
01:06:26,500 --> 01:06:27,659
Woman.

680
01:06:28,329 --> 01:06:29,500
Man.

681
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:31,159
Woman.

682
01:06:34,500 --> 01:06:35,329
The eyes.

683
01:06:35,829 --> 01:06:37,000
Nose.

684
01:06:37,659 --> 01:06:39,000
Mouth.

685
01:06:39,500 --> 01:06:40,659
Ear.

686
01:06:41,500 --> 01:06:42,659
Shoulder.

687
01:06:43,329 --> 01:06:44,500
Nipple.

688
01:06:44,829 --> 01:06:46,000
Belly button.

689
01:06:46,659 --> 01:06:47,659
The eyes.

690
01:06:47,659 --> 01:06:49,000
Nose.

691
01:06:49,500 --> 01:06:50,500
Mouth.

692
01:06:51,159 --> 01:06:52,329
Ear.

693
01:06:52,659 --> 01:06:53,659
Shoulder.

694
01:06:54,159 --> 01:06:55,500
Nipple.

695
01:06:55,829 --> 01:06:57,000
Belly Button.

696
01:07:00,159 --> 01:07:01,329
Penis.

697
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:03,159
Vagina.

698
01:07:09,159 --> 01:07:11,329
P-Penis...

699
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:13,329
Vagina.

700
01:07:49,500 --> 01:07:53,329
You thought that if you spoke Korean I wouldn't understand?

701
01:07:55,829 --> 01:08:00,329
At that moment, a drop of insanity, could cause one to go completely mad.

702
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:07,659
If I could drive Sasaki mad as well...

703
01:08:08,159 --> 01:08:10,659
then life would've been more fun.

704
01:08:12,829 --> 01:08:16,500
I understand you're losing sanity.

705
01:08:17,500 --> 01:08:21,000
After all, your mother was the same.

706
01:08:21,659 --> 01:08:24,159
And that's why I will train you

707
01:08:24,159 --> 01:08:25,829
to be normal again.

708
01:08:25,829 --> 01:08:28,829
If not, I will return you to Japan.

709
01:08:28,829 --> 01:08:31,159
And into an insane asylum.

710
01:08:34,500 --> 01:08:37,329
An asylum created by a German.

711
01:08:37,329 --> 01:08:40,829
It is said that their treatments are very good.

712
01:08:41,829 --> 01:08:45,500
They will dig a hole in the ground and shove lunatics in there.

713
01:08:45,500 --> 01:08:47,000
And cover it up.

714
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:49,500
If the patients are not that bad,

715
01:08:49,500 --> 01:08:51,659
they will restrain you to the bed.

716
01:08:51,659 --> 01:08:54,159
Let patients crawl like a dog.

717
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:24,829
After that, the cherry blossom tree was brought over with me

718
01:09:24,829 --> 01:09:26,500
had blossomed twice.

719
01:09:28,159 --> 01:09:31,000
Eventually Kim Yeon took off her clothing.

720
01:09:31,329 --> 01:09:34,500
Ximen Qing carefully watches her nether regions.

721
01:09:34,500 --> 01:09:38,659
There is not one strand of hair, so beautiful like a jewel.

722
01:09:41,159 --> 01:09:43,500
Read it clearly.

723
01:09:44,159 --> 01:09:47,329
Read it the same way you would lick a dish.

724
01:09:49,500 --> 01:09:52,329
Listen to how your aunt reads it.

725
01:09:59,500 --> 01:10:01,329
Eventually, Kim Yeon

726
01:10:01,329 --> 01:10:03,829
Takes off her clothes.

727
01:10:04,159 --> 01:10:05,829
Ximen Qing.

728
01:10:05,829 --> 01:10:08,159
Carefully watching her nether regions.

729
01:10:08,159 --> 01:10:09,500
There is not one

730
01:10:09,500 --> 01:10:10,159
single strand of hair

731
01:10:10,159 --> 01:10:11,659
and not only that

732
01:10:11,659 --> 01:10:13,659
it was as smooth

733
01:10:14,159 --> 01:10:16,329
as jade

734
01:10:16,829 --> 01:10:19,159
and as tight as a drum.

735
01:10:19,500 --> 01:10:22,000
and as soft as silk

736
01:10:22,659 --> 01:10:25,000
Only with a single touch

737
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:27,500
did she climax.

738
01:10:28,659 --> 01:10:33,829
The cum exudes out wine fragrance.

739
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:43,159
condenses as a dew drop

740
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:49,159
Even if in between is a deep black.

741
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:53,159
Is sometimes like something you must bear

742
01:10:53,829 --> 01:10:55,659
Touch me there. Touch me there.

743
01:10:55,659 --> 01:10:57,659
The tremble?

744
01:11:26,159 --> 01:11:28,329
Everyone said we should've chopped the tree.

745
01:11:28,329 --> 01:11:30,329
But Uncle absolutely didn't want to.

746
01:11:31,329 --> 01:11:33,500
He said this came from Mt. Fuji

747
01:11:33,500 --> 01:11:35,829
that took my aunt's last breath.

748
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:40,659
No one thought this was a big deal and only felt bad for the tree branch.

749
01:11:40,659 --> 01:11:42,500
Although, this is only words

750
01:11:42,500 --> 01:11:45,329
but I saw my Uncle stand.

751
01:11:46,159 --> 01:11:49,000
Ever since then, Cherry blossoms so blossom has caused people to be moved.

752
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:52,159
The longer the blossom, the more I found out.

753
01:12:25,659 --> 01:12:27,829
Just say it Juliet,

754
01:12:28,159 --> 01:12:31,159
This hasty the young knight.

755
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:36,000
Will save you?

756
01:12:40,829 --> 01:12:42,329
Duchess.

757
01:12:42,329 --> 01:12:44,659
Slowly shakes her head.

758
01:12:44,659 --> 01:12:48,000
I feel like that is a ill fate.

759
01:12:50,640 --> 01:12:51,640
Fine.

760
01:12:52,329 --> 01:12:54,659
The brave knight

761
01:12:59,279 --> 01:13:01,829
ah, a new guest.

762
01:13:05,090 --> 01:13:06,329
Now.

763
01:13:06,329 --> 01:13:08,659
The brave knight

764
01:13:09,829 --> 01:13:12,500
Look at these old wounds

765
01:13:12,500 --> 01:13:16,000
And the fresh ones

766
01:13:16,500 --> 01:13:19,000
What do you think?

767
01:13:21,829 --> 01:13:24,000
It is pitiful.

768
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:26,000
I really want lick it.

769
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:29,159
and stroke it.

770
01:13:30,329 --> 01:13:32,659
If that is so...

771
01:13:33,500 --> 01:13:36,329
Why don't you have a feel...

772
01:13:36,329 --> 01:13:38,329
of her whipping you.

773
01:13:44,829 --> 01:13:47,659
The duchess with a whip in her hand

774
01:13:47,659 --> 01:13:49,500
from high she swings down.

775
01:13:49,500 --> 01:13:50,829
Whip.

776
01:13:56,829 --> 01:13:58,500
Another one continues.

777
01:13:59,500 --> 01:14:00,329
Whip.

778
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:04,000
Whip.

779
01:14:06,159 --> 01:14:07,329
My penis,

780
01:14:07,329 --> 01:14:09,829
is swollen from the pain.

781
01:14:15,329 --> 01:14:16,659
Ten minutes.

782
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:19,000
If I gave her to you for 10 minutes

783
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:21,329
what would you give me in exchange?

784
01:14:22,159 --> 01:14:25,159
Whatever you want

785
01:14:25,659 --> 01:14:28,659
the sky is the limit.

786
01:14:30,159 --> 01:14:33,159
The shackles holding the duke became loose.

787
01:14:33,659 --> 01:14:37,159
I sat down on a chair, holding her.

788
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:42,659
And insert my penis into her.

789
01:14:47,829 --> 01:14:50,659
Oh. Juliet. Juliet.

790
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:57,659
When the duke came from behind,

791
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:00,829
I felt a rope on my neck.

792
01:15:02,329 --> 01:15:05,159
Very slowly, the rope got tighter.

793
01:15:05,159 --> 01:15:10,000
I felt like a person drowning, trying to grab a hold of whatever I could.

794
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:15,000
I pulled on her hair

795
01:15:15,829 --> 01:15:18,329
After that, the duke said...

796
01:15:20,659 --> 01:15:23,500
It's been 10 minutes, end it.

797
01:15:33,329 --> 01:15:35,659
Slow down, Husband.

798
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:40,000
I still haven't came yet...

799
01:15:40,500 --> 01:15:43,329
That pain.

800
01:15:48,829 --> 01:15:50,159
No.

801
01:15:50,829 --> 01:15:52,829
We will not stop.

802
01:15:54,500 --> 01:15:57,329
Let me die

803
01:16:00,329 --> 01:16:03,159
Kill me before the pain does.

804
01:16:37,500 --> 01:16:38,829
That was Sal Deok?

805
01:16:39,659 --> 01:16:41,500
It's Sal Deok style.

806
01:16:41,659 --> 01:16:45,659
The same authour as "Lizard Tongue"

807
01:16:45,659 --> 01:16:47,500
It is a Japanese person.

808
01:16:47,500 --> 01:16:52,500
I bought this from a Japanese library.

809
01:16:55,659 --> 01:16:59,159
Let this be tired in this world all over the place wandering the fellow.

810
01:16:59,659 --> 01:17:01,829
A traveler that always had people by his side.

811
01:17:01,829 --> 01:17:04,329
You get what I mean right?

812
01:17:04,659 --> 01:17:06,659
I love

813
01:17:06,659 --> 01:17:09,500
books such as this

814
01:17:10,829 --> 01:17:14,000
The final page is very amazing

815
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:17,159
illustration

816
01:17:19,159 --> 01:17:20,500
But as you all see

817
01:17:20,500 --> 01:17:22,000
it's a real pity

818
01:17:22,829 --> 01:17:25,159
If the last page was intact it would've been splendid.

819
01:17:25,159 --> 01:17:27,329
If it were so, I would've gone all out for it.

820
01:17:27,659 --> 01:17:28,829
Just relying on words...

821
01:17:28,829 --> 01:17:31,829
is very difficult to truly depict the story.

822
01:17:31,829 --> 01:17:35,500
That's why illustrations were included in the first place.

823
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:38,000
Then...

824
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:40,500
we will have a live demonstration before the auction starts...

825
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:42,329
Hideko.

826
01:19:02,829 --> 01:19:05,329
So beautiful.

827
01:19:10,829 --> 01:19:13,000
Please come again.

828
01:19:13,500 --> 01:19:15,159
Thank you.

829
01:19:15,159 --> 01:19:19,000
Today was outstanding.

830
01:19:19,500 --> 01:19:21,500
Thank you.

831
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:24,829
Especially the endscene

832
01:19:31,329 --> 01:19:33,329
With such aristocrats...

833
01:19:33,329 --> 01:19:35,329
Why?

834
01:19:35,329 --> 01:19:38,000
Is it possible to imitate other's paintings?

835
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:41,329
I believe in my craftsmanship.

836
01:19:41,329 --> 01:19:45,159
I'm very good at these types of things.

837
01:19:45,159 --> 01:19:48,659
Often pouring wine for women around me.

838
01:19:48,659 --> 01:19:50,659
To create a happy vibe.

839
01:19:50,659 --> 01:19:54,000
Even an expert wouldn't be able to tell.

840
01:19:54,829 --> 01:19:56,829
The Mistress of this house...

841
01:19:56,829 --> 01:20:00,000
can she get near you, Count?

842
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:02,159
I am able to look into a woman's eyes.

843
01:20:02,159 --> 01:20:03,829
Only her eyes.

844
01:20:03,829 --> 01:20:07,829
And she will try to dodge my glare.

845
01:20:08,500 --> 01:20:11,829
But will immediately turn back and look.

846
01:20:11,829 --> 01:20:13,829
If it were tonight.

847
01:20:13,829 --> 01:20:17,000
I'd sneak into their blanket...

848
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:19,659
The Miss here would scold and reject me...

849
01:20:19,659 --> 01:20:21,829
only one.

850
01:20:21,829 --> 01:20:24,500
Even Sasaki?

851
01:20:25,159 --> 01:20:28,159
Wasn't that your ex-wife?

852
01:20:28,159 --> 01:20:31,500
You left her just to marry a Japanese woman.

853
01:20:31,500 --> 01:20:33,159
The servants told me.

854
01:20:33,159 --> 01:20:35,829
I also heard that you two still sleep in the same bed.

855
01:20:35,829 --> 01:20:38,329
Why would you leave a wife like that?

856
01:20:38,329 --> 01:20:41,159
To become a Japanese?

857
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:45,159
Because Koreans are very ugly.

858
01:20:45,159 --> 01:20:49,159
But Japanese are very beautiful.

859
01:20:49,159 --> 01:20:52,500
Koreans are different.

860
01:20:52,500 --> 01:20:54,659
It's the other way around; the Japanese are ugly, and Koreans are pretty.

861
01:20:54,659 --> 01:20:57,000
Simplicity has its own beauty.

862
01:20:57,000 --> 01:20:59,829
Because Koreans are weak, stupid...

863
01:20:59,829 --> 01:21:01,659
So it's not possible.

864
01:21:02,659 --> 01:21:05,500
That goes for Sasaki as well.

865
01:21:05,500 --> 01:21:07,500
Really?

866
01:21:07,500 --> 01:21:09,159
I only need to talk about suitable things

867
01:21:09,159 --> 01:21:10,329
And she will not wear undergarments

868
01:21:10,329 --> 01:21:14,159
as she knocks on my bedroom door.

869
01:21:17,829 --> 01:21:20,829
We think very much alike.

870
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:24,000
And who is that?

871
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:27,000
That very same person will reject you.

872
01:21:28,829 --> 01:21:31,659
I hear you have much equipment,

873
01:21:31,659 --> 01:21:36,000
and a grand collection of sorts.

874
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:38,000
But I've see nothing.

875
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:40,159
The one person will reject you...

876
01:21:40,159 --> 01:21:42,659
Who is it?

877
01:21:44,329 --> 01:21:45,500
There was one time,

878
01:21:45,500 --> 01:21:49,159
where Hideko and I locked eyes

879
01:21:49,159 --> 01:21:52,659
and she did not look away from me

880
01:21:52,659 --> 01:21:54,500
Hideko?

881
01:21:54,500 --> 01:21:55,659
Tonight...

882
01:21:55,659 --> 01:22:00,829
will she appear in your dreams?

883
01:22:01,500 --> 01:22:04,829
Even if she did show up in my dreams,

884
01:22:04,829 --> 01:22:07,500
I feel that for us it is not meant to be.

885
01:22:07,500 --> 01:22:11,659
Because she is as cold as ice.

886
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:19,159
It is the result of a long strenuous training

887
01:22:22,500 --> 01:22:25,829
I heard that you want to marry her.

888
01:22:25,829 --> 01:22:29,329
As I see it,

889
01:22:30,159 --> 01:22:34,000
this relationship is right

890
01:22:34,329 --> 01:22:37,500
I do not see that desire in her eyes.

891
01:22:37,500 --> 01:22:41,000
Then it's no different than a soulless person.

892
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:44,500
You have to find a suitable method.

893
01:22:44,500 --> 01:22:49,000
If you don't want to make love with someone dead on the inside.

894
01:23:39,500 --> 01:23:43,829
This is my method of making things become beautiful.

895
01:23:44,829 --> 01:23:48,500
Has Miss Hideko learned the fine arts yet?

896
01:23:48,500 --> 01:23:52,329
She has only immersed in the literary arts, reading & reciting poetry.

897
01:23:52,729 --> 01:23:54,000
Then...

898
01:23:54,329 --> 01:23:56,500
When I studied in the UK

899
01:23:56,500 --> 01:24:02,829
they made girls learn painting and such...

900
01:24:03,659 --> 01:24:06,500
Whether they were aristocrats or not.

901
01:24:20,659 --> 01:24:23,500
You have a call.

902
01:24:23,500 --> 01:24:25,500
Why are there people calling so late at night.

903
01:24:25,500 --> 01:24:28,159
It's about the Yanshu and the book.

904
01:24:28,159 --> 01:24:29,659
Is that so?

905
01:24:29,659 --> 01:24:32,500
Excuse me.

906
01:24:41,659 --> 01:24:44,000
You must like... or....

907
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:46,829
Like what?

908
01:24:46,829 --> 01:24:51,829
ever since the men said when they want to touch the breasts of a woman.

909
01:24:51,829 --> 01:24:54,000
That Western style of speech...

910
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:56,500
I do know a bit.

911
01:24:57,659 --> 01:25:01,159
After all, I do read books.

912
01:25:01,159 --> 01:25:03,659
No matter how how beautiful the words are

913
01:25:03,659 --> 01:25:05,500
its still like playing with fire.

914
01:25:05,500 --> 01:25:06,500
Hot.

915
01:25:06,500 --> 01:25:09,329
That's how I feel.

916
01:25:09,329 --> 01:25:11,329
What fire?

917
01:25:11,329 --> 01:25:16,000
I'm a cold-hearted Mistress, Count.

918
01:25:20,659 --> 01:25:23,000
He's going to come back soon.

919
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:25,659
Yanshu calling...

920
01:25:25,659 --> 01:25:27,659
is because I wanted to talk to you alone about something.

921
01:25:27,659 --> 01:25:31,329
I want to talk about your future.

922
01:25:31,329 --> 01:25:35,500
I will be waiting at the lamppost at midnight.

923
01:25:36,329 --> 01:25:40,159
Yanshu is a fool.

924
01:26:28,329 --> 01:26:30,659
There's a maid sleeping behind you.

925
01:26:30,659 --> 01:26:33,159
I don't want you to be tied in a scandal.

926
01:26:33,159 --> 01:26:36,500
I saw Keiko carrying pillows and leaving already.

927
01:26:36,500 --> 01:26:39,500
You don't think about the face you have as an aristocrat?

928
01:26:39,500 --> 01:26:41,159
I am not an aristocrat.

929
01:26:41,159 --> 01:26:43,500
I'm not even Japanese.

930
01:26:43,500 --> 01:26:46,659
What do you think I came here for?

931
01:26:46,659 --> 01:26:50,829
I have heard many rumors about you within my 15 years of living in Japan.

932
01:26:50,829 --> 01:26:53,500
After that, I spent 3 years preparing,

933
01:26:53,500 --> 01:26:55,000
learning about poetry and linguistics.

934
01:26:55,000 --> 01:26:57,159
And even picked up ways to replicate paintings.

935
01:26:57,159 --> 01:26:59,659
All just to meet you.

936
01:26:59,659 --> 01:27:01,159
Persuading you to marry me.

937
01:27:01,159 --> 01:27:04,159
To appropriate your father's assets.

938
01:27:04,159 --> 01:27:07,159
After that, abandon you.

939
01:27:08,159 --> 01:27:10,329
But after I have met you, I know

940
01:27:10,329 --> 01:27:13,159
not just anyone can seduce you.

941
01:27:14,659 --> 01:27:16,500
Can't?

942
01:27:17,500 --> 01:27:22,000
That's why I have a proposal for you.

943
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:23,829
Although the wedding binds us,

944
01:27:23,829 --> 01:27:26,500
this is all of choice, its up to you.

945
01:27:26,500 --> 01:27:28,500
I will save you from this place.

946
01:27:28,500 --> 01:27:32,659
To a place no one knows.

947
01:27:33,500 --> 01:27:36,500
And of course, the money will be split.

948
01:27:36,829 --> 01:27:39,000
That's impossible.

949
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:42,500
A lady marrying some old man...

950
01:27:42,500 --> 01:27:43,659
Do you think that's possible?

951
01:27:43,659 --> 01:27:46,159
I won't marry anyone.

952
01:27:46,159 --> 01:27:48,159
If you think like that?

953
01:27:53,159 --> 01:27:55,000
Then it's wrong.

954
01:27:55,000 --> 01:27:57,159
Not beautiful.

955
01:27:57,159 --> 01:28:00,000
Miss, if you commit suicide who will inherit the assets?

956
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:02,159
Is that what you want?

957
01:28:02,159 --> 01:28:04,829
To give your assets away to that old pervert?

958
01:28:04,829 --> 01:28:07,000
Then he'll find a young beautiful girl

959
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:09,159
and hide her away, and train her to read.

960
01:28:10,329 --> 01:28:12,829
Uncle will find out about us.

961
01:28:12,829 --> 01:28:15,329
If we get caught, he'll drag us down into the cellar.

962
01:28:15,329 --> 01:28:17,159
Uncle.

963
01:28:17,659 --> 01:28:18,500
Underground?

964
01:28:18,500 --> 01:28:21,829
It's written in here that if someone is hung

965
01:28:21,829 --> 01:28:27,829
they will stick there tongue out and defecate themselves.

966
01:28:27,829 --> 01:28:32,500
But that day, why was aunt's lips shut.

967
01:28:32,500 --> 01:28:35,659
And she was very clean.

968
01:28:36,159 --> 01:28:39,329
Come with me somewhere.

969
01:28:55,829 --> 01:28:57,500
Here,

970
01:28:57,500 --> 01:28:59,829
is where I did things with your aunt.

971
01:28:59,829 --> 01:29:02,329
I will tell you.

972
01:29:02,329 --> 01:29:05,659
And you will not want to leave.

973
01:29:05,659 --> 01:29:07,829
Do you understand?

974
01:29:24,829 --> 01:29:27,159
That day, only look at. Listen.

975
01:29:27,159 --> 01:29:31,159
and I never want to go down there for a second time.

976
01:29:35,500 --> 01:29:37,159
This is a high concentration of opium.

977
01:29:37,159 --> 01:29:39,500
If you drink 3 drops, you will sleep all night.

978
01:29:39,500 --> 01:29:42,659
5 will make you completely pass out.

979
01:29:42,659 --> 01:29:45,329
If you want to die within 5 minutes

980
01:29:45,329 --> 01:29:47,329
then drink this entire vile.

981
01:29:47,329 --> 01:29:50,659
As long as you have this, your Uncle will not be able to take you down to the cellar.

982
01:29:50,659 --> 01:29:52,829
At least then you will be able to die quickly.

983
01:29:52,829 --> 01:29:55,329
If you except my marriage proposal, you can think of this as a wedding gift.

984
01:29:55,329 --> 01:29:58,159
This is more expensive than a diamond.

985
01:30:08,659 --> 01:30:11,000
Find me a maid.

986
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:13,829
One where if she was to disappear no one would notice or care.

987
01:30:13,829 --> 01:30:15,659
A bit stupid as well could be good.

988
01:30:15,659 --> 01:30:19,000
One to be locked in the insane asylum

989
01:30:19,000 --> 01:30:20,500
under my name and cannot escape.

990
01:30:20,500 --> 01:30:22,829
If I were to find you this type of maid,

991
01:30:22,829 --> 01:30:26,000
what would you do with Keiko?

992
01:30:30,659 --> 01:30:34,329
I'm prettier than Miss Hideko?

993
01:30:34,329 --> 01:30:36,329
Are you serious?

994
01:30:37,000 --> 01:30:38,500
Of course.

995
01:30:38,500 --> 01:30:41,659
Hideko is pretty, but you, Keiko, are even prettier

996
01:30:41,659 --> 01:30:43,829
You can even speak Korean?

997
01:30:44,500 --> 01:30:46,829
I learned Korean

998
01:30:46,829 --> 01:30:51,500
Just so I can talk with you.

999
01:30:52,659 --> 01:30:56,000
I really wanted to say this to you.

1000
01:30:56,659 --> 01:30:59,829
You're enticed aren't you.

1001
01:31:01,829 --> 01:31:03,829
This adorable thing.

1002
01:31:10,829 --> 01:31:14,659
If someone finds out about this, I will be fired.

1003
01:31:14,659 --> 01:31:17,329
Don't worry about that.

1004
01:31:17,329 --> 01:31:19,829
Come and live with me.

1005
01:32:40,500 --> 01:32:43,329
The maid Count sent over is very suitable.

1006
01:32:43,329 --> 01:32:46,500
She seems so foolish and naive.

1007
01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:51,329
Mother.

1008
01:33:01,659 --> 01:33:07,000
If possible, let Sook-Hee look at the artifacts or some clothes.

1009
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:11,500
She goes crazy over these things.

1010
01:33:11,500 --> 01:33:15,500
Its ok if Sook-Hee reads this letter

1011
01:33:15,500 --> 01:33:17,500
She's illiterate and cannot read.

1012
01:33:17,500 --> 01:33:19,500
Can you help me read this?

1013
01:33:19,500 --> 01:33:20,159
Huh?

1014
01:33:21,329 --> 01:33:23,000
This is your name.

1015
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:24,829
You don't even know your own name?

1016
01:33:29,329 --> 01:33:31,829
What happened to your foot?

1017
01:33:35,500 --> 01:33:37,000
Who was it?

1018
01:33:37,000 --> 01:33:40,329
Who took Tamako's shoe.

1019
01:33:46,500 --> 01:33:49,159
Apologize to her in front of all the maids later.

1020
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:55,000
If she leaves because of you people,

1021
01:33:55,000 --> 01:33:59,829
you will be stripped naked and thrown out.

1022
01:34:04,500 --> 01:34:06,829
Its done.

1023
01:34:12,829 --> 01:34:14,829
Is the fragrance ok?

1024
01:34:14,829 --> 01:34:16,829
Why don't you join me in here.

1025
01:34:16,829 --> 01:34:18,659
What?

1026
01:34:34,829 --> 01:34:36,659
You don't need to be embarrassed Miss.

1027
01:34:36,659 --> 01:34:39,159
Even a professional jeweler could hardly tell the difference

1028
01:34:39,159 --> 01:34:41,829
Is that so?

1029
01:34:46,659 --> 01:34:49,159
I'm returning the earrings I borrowed from you.

1030
01:34:49,159 --> 01:34:53,159
Women love to play with fate.

1031
01:34:53,159 --> 01:34:58,159
She always takes the earrings and tries them on as she looks in the mirror.

1032
01:34:58,159 --> 01:35:01,329
I feel that Sook-Hee will do her best.

1033
01:35:01,329 --> 01:35:04,829
She won't be suspicious about us.

1034
01:35:04,829 --> 01:35:08,500
Until the day comes, don't let Sook-Hee find out.

1035
01:35:08,500 --> 01:35:13,829
Let her do her best to help you fall in love with me.

1036
01:35:14,829 --> 01:35:19,329
She do any and everything to persuade you.

1037
01:35:20,159 --> 01:35:22,159
For me?

1038
01:35:30,329 --> 01:35:33,659
Now you look like a Miss.

1039
01:35:40,659 --> 01:35:43,500
Why did your mom pass away?

1040
01:35:43,500 --> 01:35:47,659
"I'm so lucky to have given birth to you before I died"

1041
01:35:47,659 --> 01:35:50,659
"I don't feel burdened at all"

1042
01:35:51,329 --> 01:35:56,159
Is it like that in the books?

1043
01:36:03,329 --> 01:36:05,329
Men are disgusting.

1044
01:36:05,329 --> 01:36:08,659
Why do you always think of those things.

1045
01:36:08,659 --> 01:36:11,159
You're asking me about how I think?

1046
01:36:11,159 --> 01:36:15,829
You think all I'm interested in is your body?

1047
01:36:16,659 --> 01:36:17,829
Is that so?

1048
01:36:17,829 --> 01:36:19,500
You definitely have been reading too many of those erotic writings.

1049
01:36:19,500 --> 01:36:22,000
If there's anything I do want from you...

1050
01:36:22,500 --> 01:36:27,829
Its not your eyes, hands, or ass.

1051
01:36:27,829 --> 01:36:31,000
But your money.

1052
01:36:31,000 --> 01:36:34,659
You having the first is money.

1053
01:36:35,500 --> 01:36:39,659
Talking and teasing an aristocrat like you is so fun.

1054
01:36:39,659 --> 01:36:42,000
Why she like this?

1055
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:46,000
Why is she so angry?

1056
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:49,500
When she sleeps sighs so heavily.

1057
01:36:50,329 --> 01:36:55,000
Every time I meet with the Count, Sook-Hee always looks so angry.

1058
01:36:55,000 --> 01:36:57,500
I don't like it.

1059
01:36:57,500 --> 01:36:59,159
Please endure when Sook-Hee comes back.

1060
01:36:59,159 --> 01:37:00,659
When she sees this scene,

1061
01:37:00,659 --> 01:37:03,659
Only then will she believe in the engagement.

1062
01:37:22,159 --> 01:37:24,000
Then treat me as a doll.

1063
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:26,659
I'll also think of another woman.

1064
01:37:26,659 --> 01:37:29,329
And who will you think of?

1065
01:37:31,159 --> 01:37:34,500
Duchess Juliet.

1066
01:37:35,659 --> 01:37:37,829
Miss!

1067
01:37:37,829 --> 01:37:40,329
Count!

1068
01:37:45,159 --> 01:37:47,500
Miss...

1069
01:37:50,159 --> 01:37:54,329
Her feelings were locked, deep away.

1070
01:37:54,329 --> 01:37:57,659
Kim Lan couldn't explain.

1071
01:37:58,829 --> 01:38:01,000
When the Lady found out about this,

1072
01:38:01,000 --> 01:38:05,329
she brought 4 silver bells to Kim Lan.

1073
01:38:05,329 --> 01:38:06,500
Calling them "distant bells"

1074
01:38:06,500 --> 01:38:09,829
Something used to expand...

1075
01:38:09,829 --> 01:38:13,500
Two to put inside of the Lady.

1076
01:38:13,500 --> 01:38:18,000
Two to put into her.

1077
01:38:19,159 --> 01:38:21,500
The two spread their legs.

1078
01:38:21,500 --> 01:38:22,329
Just like two scissors.

1079
01:38:22,329 --> 01:38:24,000
and intertwine.

1080
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:26,329
And touch each other.

1081
01:38:26,329 --> 01:38:29,500
Their labias' rubbing together.

1082
01:38:29,500 --> 01:38:31,659
Combined with the sound of the bells ringing

1083
01:38:31,659 --> 01:38:33,829
There's a power outage, go get the lights.

1084
01:38:33,829 --> 01:38:35,449
Yes. Understood.

1085
01:38:39,159 --> 01:38:41,829
Kim Lan asked,

1086
01:38:41,829 --> 01:38:44,159
When will this be put in?

1087
01:38:44,159 --> 01:38:45,659
the Lady asked, why?

1088
01:38:45,659 --> 01:38:49,829
It went in deep.

1089
01:38:50,329 --> 01:38:53,329
And the saliva

1090
01:38:53,329 --> 01:38:56,329
Why are you telling me these sweet things.

1091
01:39:00,159 --> 01:39:02,329
To kiss.

1092
01:39:02,329 --> 01:39:05,659
Why caress my breasts?

1093
01:39:06,659 --> 01:39:09,000
Why is my pussy wet?

1094
01:39:09,000 --> 01:39:12,329
And lightly bite the shoulder.

1095
01:39:12,329 --> 01:39:16,829
At that time the bells were put in...

1096
01:39:20,329 --> 01:39:23,329
and-  -Outstanding!

1097
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:44,659
So cute.

1098
01:39:49,500 --> 01:39:52,329
If the Count were to see this...

1099
01:39:58,500 --> 01:40:01,829
Would he be as gentle as you?

1100
01:40:02,659 --> 01:40:03,659
Of course.

1101
01:40:03,659 --> 01:40:05,329
After that, the Count will...

1102
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:07,000
will...

1103
01:40:07,829 --> 01:40:08,659
also...

1104
01:40:17,500 --> 01:40:19,329
Keep going Tamako.

1105
01:40:20,500 --> 01:40:21,829
Like the Count would.

1106
01:40:24,829 --> 01:40:26,159
The Count..

1107
01:40:26,500 --> 01:40:27,829
The Count...

1108
01:40:28,329 --> 01:40:30,659
Will like this very much.

1109
01:40:33,329 --> 01:40:34,159
After that,

1110
01:40:35,159 --> 01:40:36,659
He would...

1111
01:40:39,000 --> 01:40:42,329
So soft, so warm...

1112
01:40:43,000 --> 01:40:44,829
Ah so wet.

1113
01:40:48,659 --> 01:40:52,659
Your beauty takes peoples' breath away.

1114
01:41:24,659 --> 01:41:27,500
Mistress, do you want me to continue?

1115
01:41:29,000 --> 01:41:30,159
Yes, continue.

1116
01:41:30,659 --> 01:41:32,159
Teach me everything.

1117
01:42:17,159 --> 01:42:21,659
I could die happily know that I got to eat you out.

1118
01:42:36,500 --> 01:42:38,000
Am I good?

1119
01:42:39,829 --> 01:42:41,000
Am I good?

1120
01:42:43,159 --> 01:42:45,659
Will you promise to never leave me?

1121
01:42:47,500 --> 01:42:48,829
Yes.

1122
01:42:49,329 --> 01:42:50,500
Absolutely.

1123
01:42:51,829 --> 01:42:52,829
I will not...

1124
01:42:53,000 --> 01:42:54,000
What?

1125
01:43:07,329 --> 01:43:08,329
Mistress.

1126
01:43:09,159 --> 01:43:13,000
At the beginning didn't know anything.

1127
01:43:13,659 --> 01:43:15,500
Looks like she's a natural.

1128
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:09,000
Wait a minute...

1129
01:44:11,500 --> 01:44:12,659
Stop it...

1130
01:44:14,659 --> 01:44:17,000
It's because of you I didn't succeed.

1131
01:44:18,500 --> 01:44:19,829
She knows nothing.

1132
01:44:19,829 --> 01:44:23,500
If you continue like this, she will be afraid and back out.

1133
01:44:30,159 --> 01:44:31,159
Do you see?

1134
01:44:32,659 --> 01:44:35,329
If she is doubting the marriage,

1135
01:44:35,329 --> 01:44:38,159
then maybe she will quit.

1136
01:44:38,829 --> 01:44:42,000
You have to convince her to fall in love with me.

1137
01:44:42,000 --> 01:44:43,159
I can't do it.

1138
01:44:43,500 --> 01:44:44,159
What?

1139
01:44:45,000 --> 01:44:46,329
I want to quit.

1140
01:44:48,500 --> 01:44:49,829
What's with everyone today?

1141
01:44:52,329 --> 01:44:53,829
You're doing this because you pity her, am I right?

1142
01:44:57,329 --> 01:44:59,159
Why are women like this?

1143
01:45:02,500 --> 01:45:04,159
But the one Sook-Hee is pitying,

1144
01:45:04,329 --> 01:45:06,159
do you know what she says about you?

1145
01:45:06,659 --> 01:45:10,159
She says you're too naive, if someone were to pull your nipple you wouldn't even know what it means.

1146
01:45:10,159 --> 01:45:13,159
She says you're so pitiful, so easy to blush.

1147
01:45:13,159 --> 01:45:15,000
So easy to manipulate.

1148
01:45:15,000 --> 01:45:18,329
With that innocent and naive face....

1149
01:45:18,659 --> 01:45:21,329
Yes, Miss you will definitely fall in love with the Count

1150
01:45:21,329 --> 01:45:24,500
Even though I don't love him, but someone else

1151
01:45:25,659 --> 01:45:27,329
you still want me to...

1152
01:45:28,000 --> 01:45:29,829
a nobody,

1153
01:45:30,500 --> 01:45:33,000
get married with someone like him?

1154
01:45:33,500 --> 01:45:34,159
That's right.

1155
01:45:46,159 --> 01:45:47,000
Miss.

1156
01:46:10,000 --> 01:46:12,329
It would've been better if I was never born.

1157
01:46:25,659 --> 01:46:29,000
To have never taken a breath and live.

1158
01:46:48,829 --> 01:46:49,500
Let go.

1159
01:46:52,329 --> 01:46:55,829
Miss, I was wrong.

1160
01:46:58,159 --> 01:46:59,000
You won't let go?

1161
01:46:59,659 --> 01:47:01,500
Miss, I was wrong.

1162
01:47:01,829 --> 01:47:05,829
Don't kill yourself, it was my fault.

1163
01:47:07,659 --> 01:47:09,000
And where were you wrong?

1164
01:47:11,000 --> 01:47:15,659
It was me who dragged you into this mess, convincing you to marry that bastard.

1165
01:47:15,659 --> 01:47:18,659
He even wanted to throw you into an insane asylum.

1166
01:47:20,159 --> 01:47:21,500
Don't die!

1167
01:47:21,829 --> 01:47:24,329
Don't marry him Miss.

1168
01:47:26,329 --> 01:47:30,000
Sook-Hee, you care about me?

1169
01:47:35,329 --> 01:47:36,829
I care about you a lot too.

1170
01:47:42,500 --> 01:47:45,329
How do you know my name?

1171
01:47:46,659 --> 01:47:48,829
You thought you tricked me?

1172
01:47:51,329 --> 01:47:52,659
You're the one who got tricked.

1173
01:47:54,329 --> 01:47:56,829
You're the one who's going to be thrown in the asylum.

1174
01:47:58,829 --> 01:48:01,329
You will be sent there under my name.

1175
01:48:02,000 --> 01:48:05,000
After that, I will assume your identity and go with that bastard.

1176
01:48:10,000 --> 01:48:11,500
So I won't have anything against you.

1177
01:48:11,500 --> 01:48:13,829
Because you wanted to do the same to me...

1178
01:48:21,500 --> 01:48:23,159
That fucking son of a bitch!

1179
01:48:26,500 --> 01:48:28,659
I'm sorry miss!

1180
01:48:28,659 --> 01:48:33,000
Hello, it is I Sook-Hee.

1181
01:48:33,000 --> 01:48:37,329
I'm writing this letter this letter explaining the change of plans.

1182
01:48:37,329 --> 01:48:42,329
Miss Hideko has decided to work with me

1183
01:48:42,329 --> 01:48:48,000
But I need to send you something.

1184
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:52,159
Always remember things that happen in the cellar.

1185
01:49:06,829 --> 01:49:08,659
Come with me somewhere.

1186
01:49:40,829 --> 01:49:43,329
You've already taught me Japanese alphabet.

1187
01:50:05,829 --> 01:50:07,829
That son of a bitch painted this didn't he.

1188
01:50:10,159 --> 01:50:13,159
This is what he's been doing the entire time?

1189
01:50:13,159 --> 01:50:17,329
For those dirty old men?

1190
01:52:23,659 --> 01:52:28,659
When a nobleman's daughter is back from being in public, she uses straw to make a coat

1191
01:52:29,159 --> 01:52:32,329
her child is also a thief, a conman,

1192
01:52:33,500 --> 01:52:36,000
the one that saves me.

1193
01:52:36,659 --> 01:52:37,829
My Tamako.

1194
01:52:39,000 --> 01:52:40,159
My Sook-Hee

1195
01:53:31,659 --> 01:53:33,159
Son of a bitch.

1196
01:53:33,659 --> 01:53:35,829
Damn you all, bastards!

1197
01:53:37,659 --> 01:53:38,829
Miss!

1198
01:53:39,659 --> 01:53:40,659
Let go of me.

1199
01:53:42,829 --> 01:53:44,000
Miss!

1200
01:53:59,159 --> 01:54:00,000
I'm hungry.

1201
01:54:04,829 --> 01:54:09,329
I'm wearing a well-fitted suit,

1202
01:54:10,159 --> 01:54:13,159
Can't I wear it to a fancy French restaurant?

1203
01:54:14,159 --> 01:54:16,829
Those colonist soldiers...

1204
01:54:17,159 --> 01:54:20,000
some recognize me.

1205
01:54:20,329 --> 01:54:21,659
That's why they're jeering at me.

1206
01:54:21,659 --> 01:54:23,659
I thought they would call the manager to kick me out.

1207
01:54:24,659 --> 01:54:25,500
What?

1208
01:54:26,659 --> 01:54:31,159
They're waiting for me to devour my food.

1209
01:54:31,159 --> 01:54:32,329
How funny.

1210
01:54:33,500 --> 01:54:36,000
And they began calling me Count.

1211
01:54:36,000 --> 01:54:37,829
And I began getting fame.

1212
01:54:37,829 --> 01:54:40,000
To be honest I'm not all that interested in money.

1213
01:54:40,500 --> 01:54:42,659
What exatly do I want?

1214
01:54:44,000 --> 01:54:46,500
Is not needing to see the price when I drink wine.

1215
01:54:46,829 --> 01:54:48,329
Something like that.

1216
01:55:00,159 --> 01:55:02,659
It's a 14 hour train ride to Vladivostok

1217
01:55:02,659 --> 01:55:04,659
This is a castle in Russia.

1218
01:55:06,829 --> 01:55:08,159
How about we get married there?

1219
01:55:13,159 --> 01:55:15,000
In a few days, the asylum will contact us.

1220
01:55:17,329 --> 01:55:19,829
Saying my wife has passed.

1221
01:55:24,000 --> 01:55:27,000
Looks like she wasn't only getting locked up?

1222
01:55:27,500 --> 01:55:29,000
Say that to Sook-Hee's face.

1223
01:55:29,000 --> 01:55:30,829
what's the point of living in there?

1224
01:55:39,329 --> 01:55:40,659
Damn.

1225
01:55:46,329 --> 01:55:48,500
I've prepared the passports.

1226
01:55:48,500 --> 01:55:50,329
Stick your photo over hers.

1227
01:55:51,500 --> 01:55:55,500
Tomorrow, Sook-Hee will be reborn.

1228
01:55:56,000 --> 01:55:57,000
Happy?

1229
01:55:57,500 --> 01:55:59,000
To be married to me.

1230
01:56:00,159 --> 01:56:01,659
This time, using Sook-Hee's identity.

1231
01:56:03,500 --> 01:56:05,329
Want to commit another crime?

1232
01:56:12,000 --> 01:56:15,000
I had a feeling the Miss would like it.

1233
01:56:18,659 --> 01:56:20,659
Sook-Hee at a place like that...

1234
01:56:22,000 --> 01:56:24,000
so pitiful.

1235
01:56:26,159 --> 01:56:29,159
Do you ever think about her?

1236
01:56:29,659 --> 01:56:31,659
No. I do not pity her.

1237
01:56:32,329 --> 01:56:35,000
We're doing illegal things anyways.

1238
01:56:35,500 --> 01:56:39,159
Is it stupid to love someone being someone like you?

1239
01:56:39,159 --> 01:56:41,159
Of course.

1240
01:56:41,829 --> 01:56:45,159
That's why even if I did love you and did things,

1241
01:56:45,659 --> 01:56:47,329
I don't have a drop of pity.

1242
01:56:47,829 --> 01:56:48,829
Love.

1243
01:56:51,000 --> 01:56:53,000
A conman like you knows what love is?

1244
01:57:14,659 --> 01:57:16,329
What happened?

1245
01:57:17,159 --> 01:57:19,659
It's on fire!

1246
01:57:27,159 --> 01:57:31,659
Over here!

1247
01:58:41,829 --> 01:58:44,659
Because you were thoughtful

1248
01:58:44,659 --> 01:58:46,829
You have overcome so many obstacles for me.

1249
01:58:46,829 --> 01:58:48,829
Just so I can be reborn

1250
01:58:50,659 --> 01:58:52,159
I am so grateful.

1251
01:58:54,659 --> 01:58:56,329
I agree to kiss you.

1252
01:59:01,659 --> 01:59:02,329
I don't want that.

1253
01:59:02,829 --> 01:59:03,500
Why?

1254
01:59:07,159 --> 01:59:09,159
Because I don't like to start out with kissing.

1255
01:59:09,159 --> 01:59:11,500
Because you won't learn anything.

1256
01:59:14,000 --> 01:59:15,500
I want to start from here.

1257
01:59:16,159 --> 01:59:18,159
Travel down from your stomach and kiss down there first.

1258
01:59:18,159 --> 01:59:19,159
A hard kiss.

1259
01:59:20,500 --> 01:59:21,829
Then do it.

1260
01:59:25,659 --> 01:59:27,329
But I am not in the mood right now.

1261
01:59:27,659 --> 01:59:28,329
Don't you know?

1262
01:59:28,329 --> 01:59:30,159
You can't trick me.

1263
01:59:35,500 --> 01:59:36,829
Wait 10 minutes.

1264
01:59:37,329 --> 01:59:39,500
If I become your woman,

1265
01:59:39,500 --> 01:59:41,500
what will you give me?

1266
01:59:42,329 --> 01:59:44,659
Whatever you want.

1267
01:59:44,659 --> 01:59:47,500
The sky is the limit.

1268
02:00:11,829 --> 02:00:13,329
I have lots to teach you.

1269
02:00:15,500 --> 02:00:18,329
You will become a perfect woman.

1270
02:02:03,829 --> 02:02:05,000
Hideko

1271
02:02:10,000 --> 02:02:12,829
I too read a book a few days ago,

1272
02:02:12,829 --> 02:02:18,829
in there it said when women are forcefully taken, they have more pleasure.

1273
02:02:18,829 --> 02:02:22,500
So now just lie down.

1274
02:03:48,829 --> 02:03:52,000
Hahaha.

1275
02:03:58,500 --> 02:04:01,659
Can you help me get that?

1276
02:04:45,159 --> 02:04:48,000
Send this to Uncle

1277
02:04:48,329 --> 02:04:53,329
Every time I watched Uncle and the Count speak Japanese so fluently,

1278
02:04:53,329 --> 02:04:58,159
he concentrated on instigating fear on the aristocrats.

1279
02:04:58,159 --> 02:05:02,000
In my heart, I think the who should be pitied is Uncle.

1280
02:05:03,500 --> 02:05:08,159
I am very happy to tell you,

1281
02:05:08,159 --> 02:05:10,829
that you don't have to do anything.

1282
02:05:10,829 --> 02:05:12,159
That person.

1283
02:05:12,159 --> 02:05:16,000
Is a peasant from Jeju.

1284
02:05:16,500 --> 02:05:21,500
That's right, did you receive my gift Uncle?

1285
02:05:21,500 --> 02:05:26,159
Can I use Korean to explain my gift?

1286
02:05:26,159 --> 02:05:29,159
Sorry, force of habit,

1287
02:05:29,159 --> 02:05:32,829
i am not in a pressured relationship, I like women.

1288
02:05:32,829 --> 02:05:36,329
I am thankful for him, out of all the maids,

1289
02:05:36,329 --> 02:05:41,500
He gave me Sook-Hee

1290
02:05:54,000 --> 02:05:58,000
You said you wanted to see my collection right?

1291
02:05:58,000 --> 02:06:02,159
Don't just see it, but feel it.

1292
02:06:02,159 --> 02:06:08,500
I chose five items I like the most.

1293
02:06:10,000 --> 02:06:12,500
Look. First...

1294
02:06:15,000 --> 02:06:17,659
Whip To Talk.

1295
02:06:25,829 --> 02:06:28,329
Aristocrat Lizard.

1296
02:06:39,659 --> 02:06:43,329
Sinful Undergarments.

1297
02:06:53,159 --> 02:06:56,159
Pull A Little Bit.

1298
02:07:00,329 --> 02:07:02,659
Doctor Chan's office.

1299
02:07:05,829 --> 02:07:08,329
Doctor Jang bedroom.

1300
02:07:20,159 --> 02:07:23,829
How did you get tricked by that brat?

1301
02:07:26,159 --> 02:07:31,500
But don't worry, I will catch them.

1302
02:07:32,829 --> 02:07:35,159
I have prepared...

1303
02:07:35,159 --> 02:07:39,000
things that will never let those two escape.

1304
02:07:44,500 --> 02:07:46,829
Please change these tickets to Shanghai.

1305
02:07:46,829 --> 02:07:50,000
Two ticket changes from Vladivostok to Shanghai?

1306
02:07:50,000 --> 02:07:52,659
Yes. That's right.

1307
02:07:52,659 --> 02:07:54,659
Please show passport.

1308
02:08:01,159 --> 02:08:03,829
Lady Nam Sook Hee.

1309
02:08:06,159 --> 02:08:08,500
Mister Gao Phan Shou.

1310
02:08:16,000 --> 02:08:18,829
That will be 3 more dollars.

1311
02:08:18,829 --> 02:08:20,829
Okay.

1312
02:08:24,000 --> 02:08:29,329
I am a dirty old man who likes erotica.

1313
02:08:30,159 --> 02:08:33,829
Everyone absorbs every story differently.

1314
02:08:34,500 --> 02:08:41,159
That is my passion.

1315
02:08:41,159 --> 02:08:45,000
But now, it's all over. What do I do?

1316
02:08:45,000 --> 02:08:48,329
Now only you can tell me.

1317
02:08:49,329 --> 02:08:55,329
How's Hideko? Is she hot?

1318
02:08:55,329 --> 02:08:57,329
Tell me

1319
02:08:59,500 --> 02:09:03,000
Give me a cigarette, it will help me remember.

1320
02:09:03,500 --> 02:09:09,659
You love smoking right?

1321
02:09:26,829 --> 02:09:31,500
How is Hideko?

1322
02:09:36,829 --> 02:09:41,659
This place doesn't have windows?

1323
02:09:44,500 --> 02:09:48,329
Sook Hee will eavesdrop, just endure.

1324
02:09:55,829 --> 02:10:01,159
Yeah. That's right.

1325
02:10:12,659 --> 02:10:17,000
What? Don't just stop half way!

1326
02:10:17,000 --> 02:10:26,159
You have to describe where you started, face, chest, nipples.

1327
02:10:26,159 --> 02:10:29,500
Or did you touch her pussy?

1328
02:10:30,829 --> 02:10:35,659
Softly or hard?

1329
02:10:36,329 --> 02:10:45,500
Were there many folds? Was she wet?

1330
02:10:46,500 --> 02:10:50,000
Give me one more cigarette.

1331
02:11:22,829 --> 02:11:30,500
I dare say, the most amazing parts have never been written down in any book

1332
02:11:33,000 --> 02:11:37,500
It feels like I'm listening to the singing of a child

1333
02:12:11,829 --> 02:12:17,329
Then there were drops of crimson blood dripping down.

1334
02:12:25,500 --> 02:12:28,500
From that, she became a blossomed woman.

1335
02:12:28,500 --> 02:12:33,159
She once was a naive little girl, but now she has guts.

1336
02:12:36,000 --> 02:12:42,829
What is this, naive, guts eh?

1337
02:12:42,829 --> 02:12:49,000
Tell me, the essence, the process,

1338
02:12:49,000 --> 02:12:55,159
You understand right? Did she resist?

1339
02:12:55,500 --> 02:13:02,659
Did you squeeze her ass? Or swear at her?

1340
02:13:03,000 --> 02:13:08,000
If you didn't then you should have.

1341
02:13:08,000 --> 02:13:13,000
Now she is a widow.

1342
02:13:15,500 --> 02:13:19,159
Hideko is my wife.

1343
02:13:19,159 --> 02:13:24,500
There's no one else who can tell about the sexual experience with her.

1344
02:14:30,659 --> 02:14:49,000
But at this damp and somber place,

1345
02:14:50,000 --> 02:14:57,329
you've become an obscure lunatic.

1346
02:14:58,329 --> 02:15:05,329
The toxicity in the smoke is very strong, only 1 cigarette is enough.

1347
02:15:08,329 --> 02:15:13,500
Even like this, dying is a luxury.
