1
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:26,015  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
SEX AND LUCIA

2
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:10,814  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
I'm sorry, Lorenzo.
For everything I said when I left.

3
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:13,295  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Yeah, but you were right.

4
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:15,777  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
You live with a sick person.

5
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:18,816  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
No, that's not true.

6
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:21,772  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
I was too hard on you.

7
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:24,016  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
Don't worry, Lucía.
That's it.

8
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:28,454  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
I'm in a hole. I've tried to
get out, but I can't.

9
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:31,251  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
I'm lost forever.

10
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:34,500  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
I'll take a few days off
and we'll take a trip.

11
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:36,654  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
To your island.

12
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:39,216  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
You can show me.
How about it?

13
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:44,131  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
Just the two of us.
It's calm this time of year.

14
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:46,774  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
We'll swim and lay in the sun.

15
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:49,296  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
I don't want to go to that lsland.

16
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:54,936  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
I don't understand you.
You always wanted to go back.

17
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:07,575  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Relax, honey. Don't worry.

18
00:03:09,740 --> 00:03:11,537  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Look, wait up for me

19
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:13,897  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
and tell me tonight.

20
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:16,690  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
I'll listen to anything you say.

21
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:25,453  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Is that why you're so screwed up?

22
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:27,298  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Something about the island?

23
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:30,060  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
I'm sorry, l can't tell
you about it.

24
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:33,337  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
You don't deserve this.
You shouldn't know.

25
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:35,337  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Lucía, we're slammed.

26
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:38,651  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Sorry, I have to hang up.

27
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:42,449  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
-We're slammed, but later...
-Yeah, slammed. Bye.

28
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:12,490  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
Sorry, but I have to go.
Lorenzo needs me.

29
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:16,170  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
If I were you,
I'd take him, pulling his ear, to a shrink.

30
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:34,209  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Lorenzo.

31
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:38,575  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Lorenzo.

32
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:17,056  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Lorenzo?

33
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:19,979  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
-Lorenzo Alvarez residence?
-Yes.

34
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:23,215  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Are you a family member?.

35
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:26,094  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
I'm his girlfriend,
I live with him. What is it?

36
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:29,451  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
This is the Police Department
calling to inform you that...

37
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:31,093  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
I've got some bad news.

38
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:32,934  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Don't wait up.

39
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:35,694  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
I may never be back.

40
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:37,219  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
You see, he...

41
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:39,138  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
A car came along and...

42
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:42,729  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
I don't know where to,
but far away.

43
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:44,931  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
I leave you everything...

44
00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:48,337  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
but me. Forgive me.
That's my last request.

45
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:15,898  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
I'll live alone.

46
00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:17,899  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
With no one else.

47
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:20,178  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
I don't need people.

48
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:31,539  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
What'll it be?

49
00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:22,849  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Alone.

50
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:24,939  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Alone in the sun.

51
00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:28,816  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
No.

52
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:32,060  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
I'm not gonna swim.
I'll stay in the sun.

53
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:40,689  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Alone.

54
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:43,656  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Alone in the sun.

55
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:46,535  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
Alone.
Alone in the sun.

56
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:05,777  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
SEX 
- 6 YEARS EARLIER -

57
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:07,056  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
The best fuck of my life.

58
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:10,851  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
I don't even know your name.

59
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:13,898  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
It's better that way.
Less complicated.

60
00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:18,853  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Give me a hint.

61
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:21,694  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Anything. I'd like that.

62
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:25,335  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
Like a souvenir.
Where are you from?

63
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:27,976  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Madrid.

64
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:30,255  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
I'm from Valencia.

65
00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:32,574  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Another one.

66
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:36,572  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
Two more hints each
and we go our separate ways.

67
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:40,816  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
I'm a paella expert.

68
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:44,931  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
-That's logical.
-Not quite. Keep in mind

69
00:13:45,140 --> 00:13:48,212  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
that you just fucked
a world-class cook.

70
00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:51,895  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
You're right.

71
00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:54,695  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Everything was delicious.

72
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:55,969  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Of course.

73
00:13:58,460 --> 00:14:00,769  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
A little salty, though.

74
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:02,089  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
What about you?

75
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:03,494  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Sure, lots.

76
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:05,930  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
-Let's hear one.
-I was born in Madrid

77
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:07,939  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
on this very day.

78
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:09,694  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Around this time.

79
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:13,653  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
It's your birthday!

80
00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:15,369  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Yes.

81
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:18,736  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
My birthday boy from Madrid.

82
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:21,291  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
What a great way to celebrate!

83
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:23,889  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
I'm your paella chef
from Valencia.

84
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:25,658  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
And your birthday gift.

85
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:27,812  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Hey, that's three things!

86
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:31,298  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
You gave me only two.

87
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:34,414  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
I'm going to look for the third.

88
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:06,493  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
I've been calling all morning.

89
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:08,816  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
It's not my fault he's so busy.

90
00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:12,217  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
-Then who's fault is it?
-It's his job's fault.

91
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:15,890  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
Tell him to work less.
I'll call back later.

92
00:15:37,180 --> 00:15:39,011  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
He still can't talk.

93
00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:40,773  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Can I leave him a message?

94
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:44,017  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Of course. I'll pass it on.

95
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:45,448  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Well, let's see.

96
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:47,292  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
I'm pregnant.

97
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:50,215  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Since I know it's not his,

98
00:15:50,380 --> 00:15:51,733  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
and I don't need him,

99
00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:54,215  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
tell him I'm going to find
my child's father.

100
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:56,376  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
-You're leaving?
-That's right.

101
00:15:56,900 --> 00:15:59,289  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
I'll give you two
a little hint.

102
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:01,899  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
He's not from Valencia.

103
00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:05,140  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Fine, one more hint.

104
00:16:06,620 --> 00:16:09,259  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
I'm leaving right now for...
Madrid.

105
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:14,450  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
They'll advance you 20 percent of what 
they gave you last time for your novel.

106
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:17,897  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
-I couldn't ask for more.
-No, it's fine. Thanks, Pepe.

107
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:19,579  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
It'll get me through winter.

108
00:16:19,780 --> 00:16:21,930  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
I'll have it ready by summer.

109
00:16:22,140 --> 00:16:24,893  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
Really?
You've been blocked two years.

110
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:28,809  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
I'm figuring out

111
00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:30,248  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
if I'm really a writer.

112
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:33,089  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
You? A writer?

113
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:36,014  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
To the core. 
You can´t do other thing.

114
00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:43,935  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
What about that other story?
The one about the island.

115
00:16:44,140 --> 00:16:45,368  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
And the Valencian girl?

116
00:16:46,780 --> 00:16:47,815  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Maybe.

117
00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:50,858  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
I'm going to buy smokes.

118
00:16:51,940 --> 00:16:54,818  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
Put lots of sex in it.
People always like it.

119
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:57,249  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Yeah, very.

120
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:01,813  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Can I talk to you?

121
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:04,976  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Now?

122
00:17:05,380 --> 00:17:06,733  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Later, then.

123
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:10,253  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
I'm with a friend.

124
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:17,650  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
What about?

125
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:27,255  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Well...

126
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:29,419  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Is something wrong?

127
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:33,250  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Yes.

128
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:35,056  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Tell me.

129
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:39,329  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Now?

130
00:17:40,340 --> 00:17:41,250  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Yes.

131
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:00,649  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
What's your name?

132
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:02,895  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Lucía.

133
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:04,609  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
I'm Lorenzo.

134
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:06,014  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
I know. I know you.

135
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:09,932  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
I read your novel.

136
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:12,572  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Many times, and...

137
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:14,538  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
I can't read anything else.

138
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:17,658  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
It grabbed me inside

139
00:18:18,260 --> 00:18:19,852  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
and won't let go.

140
00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:22,529  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
But...

141
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:24,891  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
I've also followed you.

142
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:26,579  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
When I see you

143
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:29,576  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
I like to follow behind

144
00:18:29,780 --> 00:18:31,099  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
and see where you go,

145
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:32,249  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
in secret.

146
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:34,774  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
I know where you live.

147
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:37,450  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
It's nearby.

148
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:39,135  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
And sometimes

149
00:18:39,340 --> 00:18:42,252  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
I see you here.
Do you recognize me?

150
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:43,930  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
No.

151
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:48,253  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
I'm a waitress

152
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:50,459  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
in that restaurant.

153
00:18:51,060 --> 00:18:52,857  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
You've never come in.

154
00:18:56,660 --> 00:18:58,218  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
My boss is fine.

155
00:18:59,140 --> 00:19:00,732  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
He's a good cook.

156
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:04,210  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
But he wants to live together,

157
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:06,174  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
and the truth is,

158
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:08,173  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
I was really glad.

159
00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:09,855  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Because...

160
00:19:10,060 --> 00:19:11,209  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
I felt needed.

161
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:13,809  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
And I even like him.

162
00:19:15,140 --> 00:19:16,255  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
So...

163
00:19:18,180 --> 00:19:19,533  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
I've decided...

164
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:24,696  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
What?

165
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:29,812  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
The person I really want
to live with is you.

166
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:31,931  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
It's not that you're lonely.

167
00:19:32,420 --> 00:19:34,411  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
I'm completely in love with you.

168
00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:37,973  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Madly, as you can see.

169
00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:45,008  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
You're so brave.

170
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:46,890  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Yeah.

171
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:50,734  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
And it's over. I tried.

172
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:54,379  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Did you enjoy that?

173
00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:01,898  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Feel free to leave.

174
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:47,297  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
Is there anything else
you want?

175
00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:49,650  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Yes.

176
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:53,975  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
With time, living together,

177
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:58,937  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
you'll end up falling in love
with me, of course.

178
00:21:24,260 --> 00:21:26,057  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
I think I just did.

179
00:21:32,540 --> 00:21:35,134  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Let's go get drunk and celebrate.

180
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:06,134  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
"You haven´t to search in another place:"

181
00:22:08,540 --> 00:22:12,834  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
"Behind this door you will find my altar."

182
00:22:19,780 --> 00:22:20,849  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
What pretty lights

183
00:22:21,060 --> 00:22:22,209  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
you have at home.

184
00:22:33,260 --> 00:22:35,649  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
I'm so happy.
You can't imagine.

185
00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:41,373  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Go ahead and undress me.

186
00:22:49,340 --> 00:22:50,295  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Forgive me, Lorenzo.

187
00:22:50,940 --> 00:22:52,658  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
I'm not used to
things working out.

188
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:10,772  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Do whatever you want to me.

189
00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:36,018  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
You start, okay?

190
00:24:42,860 --> 00:24:44,976  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
A ray of sunshine...

191
00:24:46,020 --> 00:24:47,817  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Brought your love to me...

192
00:25:17,420 --> 00:25:18,375  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Slowly.

193
00:25:18,580 --> 00:25:21,140  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
With love.
We're just starting.

194
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:28,179  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
Like that.
So it lasts longer.

195
00:26:11,740 --> 00:26:13,537  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
I'm dying, I'm dying!

196
00:26:15,940 --> 00:26:16,850  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
My love!

197
00:26:20,340 --> 00:26:21,693  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
I'm gonna die!

198
00:26:38,780 --> 00:26:40,657  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
It's delicious, Lorenzo.

199
00:26:40,820 --> 00:26:43,254  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Wait until you try the fish.

200
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:47,539  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
I've always been
around good cooks.

201
00:26:47,860 --> 00:26:49,054  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
I don't know why.

202
00:26:49,940 --> 00:26:52,408  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
Though my boss isn't around
much anymore.

203
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:55,013  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
My grandmother, yes.

204
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:56,977  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
With her home cooking...

205
00:26:58,660 --> 00:26:59,809  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
just for me.

206
00:27:00,780 --> 00:27:03,010  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
I moved in with her
when I was six.

207
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:05,377  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
She said my parents and brother

208
00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:07,855  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
had opened a newsstand in heaven

209
00:27:08,060 --> 00:27:10,096  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
in front of the angel school.

210
00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:14,769  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
A newsstand and a bookshop. Because their 
stand in the village never paid much.

211
00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:19,217  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
The three of them were killed
in a car crash.

212
00:27:19,780 --> 00:27:22,214  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
And my poor grandmother 
died two years ago...

213
00:27:23,220 --> 00:27:25,370  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
She told me the whole story in a so good way...

214
00:27:25,620 --> 00:27:26,814  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
...that I still believe it.

215
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:29,694  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
I always liked people who tell 
stories in their way.

216
00:27:30,820 --> 00:27:32,014  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
I trust them.

217
00:27:32,660 --> 00:27:35,413  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
Did your mother
teach you to cook?

218
00:27:35,620 --> 00:27:38,817  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
No. She left my dad real quick,
when I was young.

219
00:27:39,020 --> 00:27:40,851  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
I had to cook for him.

220
00:27:41,060 --> 00:27:42,857  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Until one day he got stabbed.

221
00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:50,055  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
I may be

222
00:27:50,260 --> 00:27:53,172  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
a shitty cook,
but I'm a great waitress.

223
00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:56,134  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
I have a camera.

224
00:29:05,420 --> 00:29:07,217  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
How about a striptease?

225
00:29:10,780 --> 00:29:13,658  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Right now, without getting up.

226
00:29:13,860 --> 00:29:15,293  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
If you do one later.

227
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:16,894  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
You wouldn't.

228
00:29:31,580 --> 00:29:33,855  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
I've got just what you want.

229
00:29:39,980 --> 00:29:41,971  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Oh, how I knew...

230
00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:44,455  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
I've got just what you want.
 
231
00:29:44,860 --> 00:29:49,456  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
Oh, how I knew...
I've got just what you want.

232
00:29:49,860 --> 00:29:51,976  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
It's all been taken care of,

233
00:29:52,180 --> 00:29:55,092  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
I'll settle the score,
remember...

234
00:29:55,540 --> 00:29:56,609  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
I've got a map...

235
00:29:57,780 --> 00:29:58,690  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Gorgeous.

236
00:29:58,900 --> 00:30:02,131  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
...and I'm one nosy bitch.
I'm working on it.

237
00:30:03,060 --> 00:30:06,575  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
I gotta do it,
I don't want to end up broke.

238
00:30:07,220 --> 00:30:09,051  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
My feet are my ticket...

239
00:30:09,260 --> 00:30:11,091  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Had to be good at something...

240
00:30:12,140 --> 00:30:14,131  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
I'm working on it.

241
00:30:14,340 --> 00:30:15,898  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
I'm working on it.

242
00:30:16,100 --> 00:30:17,294  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
I'm working on it.

243
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:19,377  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
I'm resourceful, baby!

244
00:30:19,580 --> 00:30:22,174  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
You turn me on,
saliva, milk and stuff...

245
00:30:22,460 --> 00:30:24,018  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
I'm in control.

246
00:32:02,340 --> 00:32:03,375  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Lorenzo...

247
00:32:04,460 --> 00:32:06,018  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Lorenzo, my love.

248
00:32:06,900 --> 00:32:08,379  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
I can't take anymore.

249
00:32:10,060 --> 00:32:12,096  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
So much love will kill me.

250
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:23,135  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
I'm dying!

251
00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:25,009  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
I'm dying!

252
00:32:30,300 --> 00:32:32,416  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Don't scream, it's no big deal!

253
00:32:37,460 --> 00:32:38,495  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Push.

254
00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:41,416  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
That's it, a little more.

255
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:45,979  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Here it comes.

256
00:32:46,260 --> 00:32:47,454  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
A little more.

257
00:32:47,780 --> 00:32:49,293  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Here it comes.

258
00:33:03,220 --> 00:33:04,414  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
I'll get the dad.

259
00:33:05,180 --> 00:33:06,249  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Yes, please.

260
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:16,339  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
You see?
Shouting makes no difference.

261
00:33:23,180 --> 00:33:24,215  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
There's no one there.

262
00:33:24,860 --> 00:33:28,011  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
It's all right, my little girl
will help me find him.

263
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:30,694  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Have you ever...

264
00:33:30,900 --> 00:33:32,458  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
with another girl...

265
00:33:32,740 --> 00:33:34,332  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
had better sex?

266
00:33:34,900 --> 00:33:35,810  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
No.

267
00:33:36,740 --> 00:33:38,332  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Tell me the truth.

268
00:33:40,660 --> 00:33:43,174  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Maybe on an isolated occasion.

269
00:33:43,860 --> 00:33:45,418  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
But it's different.

270
00:33:46,540 --> 00:33:48,815  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Isolated on the island, right?

271
00:33:50,540 --> 00:33:51,416  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Yes.

272
00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:55,692  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
A random somebody,

273
00:33:56,060 --> 00:33:57,652  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
a total stranger,

274
00:33:58,020 --> 00:33:59,658  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
with a full moon...

275
00:34:03,140 --> 00:34:06,928  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
We should go to your island.
Separately, and meet there,

276
00:34:07,140 --> 00:34:08,414  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Iike strangers.

277
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:10,855  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
We'd have the best sex ever.

278
00:34:21,540 --> 00:34:23,132  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Which do you prefer?

279
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:26,614  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Wild sex with a stranger?

280
00:34:27,820 --> 00:34:29,936  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Or sex with someone you know,

281
00:34:30,260 --> 00:34:31,613  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
someone you love,

282
00:34:31,860 --> 00:34:33,213  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
but also wild?

283
00:34:35,820 --> 00:34:36,855  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
What?

284
00:34:39,140 --> 00:34:40,653  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
You have to choose.

285
00:34:41,060 --> 00:34:43,335  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Wild sex with a stranger,

286
00:34:43,780 --> 00:34:46,852  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
or wild sex with someone

287
00:34:47,380 --> 00:34:49,814  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
who's crazy about you,
and who you love.

288
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:51,010  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Go ahead.

289
00:34:51,220 --> 00:34:53,336  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
-Be frank.
-With you.

290
00:34:55,980 --> 00:34:57,049  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Finally.

291
00:35:01,820 --> 00:35:03,776  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
I'd never imagined
being so lucky.

292
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:05,728  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Girls like you

293
00:35:05,940 --> 00:35:08,500  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
never like guys like me.

294
00:35:13,780 --> 00:35:15,338  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
You're a gift.

295
00:35:40,060 --> 00:35:42,096  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
The restaurant in Madrid
grew famous

296
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:44,734  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
thanks to the paellas
made by the silent girl.

297
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:49,698  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
She still recalled her grandmother,
buried back home with her parents.

298
00:35:50,420 --> 00:35:53,730  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
When asked where she was from,
she was so timid that

299
00:35:53,940 --> 00:35:56,090  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
she'd say she was from Malta.

300
00:35:58,060 --> 00:36:02,656  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
Her destiny changed that night,
when she ran into a real Maltese.

301
00:36:03,820 --> 00:36:06,539  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
A ray of sunshine...

302
00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:10,134  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Brought your love to me...

303
00:36:11,220 --> 00:36:12,778  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
A ray of sunshine...

304
00:36:15,060 --> 00:36:16,812  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Straight to my heart...

305
00:37:51,140 --> 00:37:53,131  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
-How's it going?
-Fine.

306
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:56,294  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Getting used to all this clean air.

307
00:37:56,820 --> 00:37:57,696  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Yeah.

308
00:37:58,740 --> 00:38:02,528  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
You get used to everything here.
This island's easy.

309
00:38:03,700 --> 00:38:04,894  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
And you're a pro.

310
00:38:05,540 --> 00:38:08,100  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Of course. You have oxygen.

311
00:38:08,580 --> 00:38:11,014  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
I'm renting scuba equipment
this summer.

312
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:15,458  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
I'm testing it.

313
00:38:16,940 --> 00:38:18,453  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
You like diving?

314
00:38:18,660 --> 00:38:21,174  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
No, not me. Just the opposite.

315
00:38:21,940 --> 00:38:23,168  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Sorry, but...

316
00:38:23,380 --> 00:38:26,133  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
I prefer open air.
Open air and sunshine.

317
00:38:27,060 --> 00:38:28,095  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Too bad.

318
00:38:29,340 --> 00:38:31,137  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
These waters are special.

319
00:38:31,540 --> 00:38:32,893  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
To each his own.

320
00:38:44,820 --> 00:38:47,539  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
This really isn't an island.

321
00:38:49,540 --> 00:38:50,575  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
It isn't?

322
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:52,892  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
It's a giant lid.

323
00:38:53,140 --> 00:38:55,176  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
A floating piece of earth.

324
00:38:55,540 --> 00:38:56,893  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Like a raft.

325
00:38:59,260 --> 00:39:01,535  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
But it isn't moving.

326
00:39:03,700 --> 00:39:06,373  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
People get dizzy here
during high tide.

327
00:39:06,580 --> 00:39:08,332  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
And no one knows why.

328
00:39:09,300 --> 00:39:10,494  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Except you.

329
00:39:11,380 --> 00:39:13,940  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
I've dived underneath
the whole island.

330
00:39:14,860 --> 00:39:16,691  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
It's totally hollow.

331
00:39:17,460 --> 00:39:19,098  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Thousands of caves,

332
00:39:20,540 --> 00:39:21,939  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
but nothing else.

333
00:39:22,780 --> 00:39:26,455  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
Not a single rock connects it
to the seafloor.

334
00:39:26,780 --> 00:39:27,849  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
What's your name?

335
00:39:29,180 --> 00:39:30,215  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Carlos.

336
00:39:31,140 --> 00:39:32,209  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
I'm Lucía.

337
00:39:33,740 --> 00:39:35,093  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Trust me, Lucía.

338
00:39:35,740 --> 00:39:37,219  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
I'll show you someday.

339
00:39:37,620 --> 00:39:38,655  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Okay.

340
00:39:40,180 --> 00:39:41,898  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
But I'll stay up here.

341
00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:45,297  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
Right. The girl waits
on the pretty side,

342
00:39:45,660 --> 00:39:47,059  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
and the crab explores the ugly,...

343
00:39:47,740 --> 00:39:48,968  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
...rocky,...

344
00:39:49,740 --> 00:39:51,173  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
...horrible side.

345
00:39:59,460 --> 00:40:00,939  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Do you want to see the good things...

346
00:40:01,140 --> 00:40:02,334  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
...on this island?

347
00:40:04,700 --> 00:40:05,576  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Yeah.

348
00:40:07,220 --> 00:40:09,051  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
I want you to meet Elena.

349
00:40:31,380 --> 00:40:32,699  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Hi, I'm Elena.

350
00:40:33,580 --> 00:40:34,615  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Lucía.

351
00:40:38,740 --> 00:40:40,219  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Stay for dinner?

352
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:43,935  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Okay.

353
00:40:44,100 --> 00:40:45,374  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
You can sleep here, too.

354
00:40:45,580 --> 00:40:47,218  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
It's a guest house.

355
00:40:47,860 --> 00:40:49,134  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Carlos is alone,

356
00:40:49,340 --> 00:40:52,571  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
so I have 9 rooms free.
Want to see them?

357
00:40:54,580 --> 00:40:55,569  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Come on.

358
00:40:58,900 --> 00:41:00,299  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
This is my room.

359
00:41:06,700 --> 00:41:08,930  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
Next to the kitchen
so I can cook on-line.

360
00:41:11,300 --> 00:41:12,096  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Come on in.

361
00:41:12,740 --> 00:41:14,059  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
No, I'm sorry.

362
00:41:14,340 --> 00:41:15,693  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
I'm not ready to see

363
00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:17,413  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
other people up close.

364
00:41:20,380 --> 00:41:21,574  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
I know which room.

365
00:41:25,380 --> 00:41:26,893  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
It's perfect for you.

366
00:41:27,620 --> 00:41:28,689  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Come on.

367
00:41:31,540 --> 00:41:34,498  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
I leave the second floor 
vacant until summer.

368
00:41:54,420 --> 00:41:56,217  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
3,000 a day in low season,

369
00:41:56,660 --> 00:41:58,491  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
but you can have it for 2,000.

370
00:41:58,700 --> 00:42:00,656  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Plus 2,000 if you want board.

371
00:42:01,020 --> 00:42:04,217  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
I recommend it,
I'm the best cook around.

372
00:42:05,540 --> 00:42:08,577  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
Can I skip dinner
and stay tonight?

373
00:42:08,780 --> 00:42:10,133  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
We'll talk tomorrow.

374
00:42:11,380 --> 00:42:12,415  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Of course.

375
00:42:16,260 --> 00:42:19,457  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
Something terrible happened
and I had to run.

376
00:42:23,180 --> 00:42:25,455  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
We'll take care of you here.

377
00:42:30,700 --> 00:42:32,497  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
A ray of sunshine...

378
00:42:34,420 --> 00:42:36,297  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Straight to my heart...

379
00:42:37,420 --> 00:42:40,332  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Brought your love to me...

380
00:42:41,140 --> 00:42:44,177  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
I'd searched for so long...

381
00:42:44,860 --> 00:42:46,498  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
And finally It's mine...

382
00:42:46,700 --> 00:42:47,974  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
I have a new guest.

383
00:42:48,820 --> 00:42:50,651  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
She's a fantastic singer.

384
00:42:51,580 --> 00:42:53,855  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
So from now on,
I'll cook even better.

385
00:42:54,060 --> 00:42:55,129  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
If possible.

386
00:42:56,900 --> 00:42:58,094  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Can I name you?

387
00:42:59,860 --> 00:43:02,738  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Name? Yeah, Lucía.

388
00:43:07,980 --> 00:43:09,538  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Are you writing it?

389
00:43:11,020 --> 00:43:12,453  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
It's still unsent.

390
00:43:13,940 --> 00:43:16,249  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
You can change your name
if you want.

391
00:43:16,500 --> 00:43:18,536  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
We all use nicknames.

392
00:43:21,180 --> 00:43:22,772  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
HER NAME'S LUCIA.

393
00:43:25,860 --> 00:43:27,657  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
A RAY OF SUNSHINE.

394
00:43:28,140 --> 00:43:29,334  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Is that okay?

395
00:43:31,260 --> 00:43:32,454  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
It's great.

396
00:43:40,140 --> 00:43:41,175  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Look.

397
00:43:41,380 --> 00:43:42,859  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
This is for you.

398
00:43:44,860 --> 00:43:46,657  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
"Sing us something, Lucía".

399
00:43:54,580 --> 00:43:56,571  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
A RAY OF SUNSHINE...

400
00:43:59,980 --> 00:44:02,369  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
STRAIGHT TO MY HEART...

401
00:44:07,060 --> 00:44:11,099  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
"Welcome, Lucía. Nice song.
Where are you?".

402
00:44:14,220 --> 00:44:18,008  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
EVERYDAY FURTHER AWAY
FROM WHERE I WAS.

403
00:44:18,660 --> 00:44:20,173  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
I like that.

404
00:44:22,100 --> 00:44:23,294  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
So would Carlos.

405
00:44:23,740 --> 00:44:24,775  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
For himself.

406
00:44:25,100 --> 00:44:26,897  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
He's been here 6 months.

407
00:44:27,260 --> 00:44:29,820  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
I sense he's still tied
to the main land.

408
00:44:31,420 --> 00:44:34,332  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
He's someone who gains 
your trust easily.

409
00:44:35,660 --> 00:44:37,332  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Is there anything between you?

410
00:44:37,540 --> 00:44:39,576  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Yeah, sex.

411
00:44:41,140 --> 00:44:42,653  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Every now and then.

412
00:44:44,020 --> 00:44:45,578  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Without intimacy.

413
00:44:47,740 --> 00:44:50,891  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
I prefer it,
this way I don't get hooked.

414
00:44:51,820 --> 00:44:54,129  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Just wild sex.

415
00:44:55,660 --> 00:44:57,457  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
It must be the island.

416
00:44:59,100 --> 00:45:00,419  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Yeah, but...

417
00:45:02,060 --> 00:45:05,689  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
Carlos has the biggest dick
I've ever seen.

418
00:45:06,220 --> 00:45:07,414  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
How lucky.

419
00:45:10,540 --> 00:45:13,418  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
I don't know where he got it.
It's enormous.

420
00:46:12,060 --> 00:46:13,413  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Where are you?

421
00:46:13,660 --> 00:46:15,013  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
The abortion part.

422
00:46:24,180 --> 00:46:25,738  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Is that a hint?

423
00:46:26,020 --> 00:46:27,373  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Why don't you take a stroll?

424
00:46:27,620 --> 00:46:28,655  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
I am.

425
00:46:29,740 --> 00:46:31,093  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
In the street.

426
00:46:31,860 --> 00:46:34,010  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
You're like an expectant father.

427
00:46:34,340 --> 00:46:35,375  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Exactly.

428
00:46:38,100 --> 00:46:39,579  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
And you're the mother.

429
00:46:48,100 --> 00:46:54,579  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
"Ay my love, without you I don´t 
understand the meaning of to wake up,"

430
00:46:57,100 --> 00:47:03,579  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
"Ay my love, without you my bed is wider,"

431
00:47:04,100 --> 00:47:09,579  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
"Ay my love who show me the truth,"

432
00:47:12,100 --> 00:47:18,579  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
"There are loneliness and 
a bunch of frost between us."

433
00:47:21,180 --> 00:47:24,729  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
It's very positive.
There's lots of happiness.

434
00:47:25,540 --> 00:47:28,213  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
It's me. I was expecting
something tragic.

435
00:47:28,420 --> 00:47:30,058  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Like in your first novel.

436
00:47:32,660 --> 00:47:35,697  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
I should have read it
while you were writing,

437
00:47:36,300 --> 00:47:38,097  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
to get used to the idea.

438
00:47:40,300 --> 00:47:42,450  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
I screwed up. I'm sorry.

439
00:47:42,900 --> 00:47:44,652  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
I'm going for a walk.

440
00:47:48,340 --> 00:47:50,490  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
I didn't grab your heart
this time.

441
00:47:51,100 --> 00:47:52,977  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
I guess I already have it.

442
00:48:05,620 --> 00:48:08,657  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
Remember that birthday
when you were on the island?

443
00:48:08,860 --> 00:48:10,896  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
You sure got a great gift.

444
00:48:12,060 --> 00:48:16,053  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
Get ready, because tonight
I've got another for you.

445
00:48:16,260 --> 00:48:19,172  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
-From me.
-Are you proposing?

446
00:48:20,500 --> 00:48:21,853  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Remember my sister?

447
00:48:22,220 --> 00:48:23,573  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
The one who's a nurse?

448
00:48:24,500 --> 00:48:27,572  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
Well, she's become
close friends with a girl

449
00:48:28,940 --> 00:48:32,376  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
whose baby she helped deliver
four years ago.

450
00:48:32,980 --> 00:48:34,333  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
A little girl.

451
00:48:40,180 --> 00:48:41,977  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Speaking of babies...

452
00:48:42,860 --> 00:48:45,328  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
How's the novel? All the stalling...

453
00:48:45,580 --> 00:48:47,696  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
What do I tell my editors?

454
00:48:48,060 --> 00:48:50,449  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
-You always think of something.
-Sure,

455
00:48:50,660 --> 00:48:54,414  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
that's why you get
all your stories from me.

456
00:48:57,060 --> 00:48:59,494  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
Write this one as is.
It's unbelievable.

457
00:49:00,660 --> 00:49:01,729  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Why's that?

458
00:49:02,180 --> 00:49:03,659  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
By the way, don't worry...

459
00:49:03,860 --> 00:49:07,455  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
...about my sister, she doesn't know
it's you. Or the mother...

460
00:49:07,660 --> 00:49:10,254  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
...who gave birth,
I don't even know her.

461
00:49:10,940 --> 00:49:12,771  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
I kept you secret.

462
00:49:13,460 --> 00:49:14,449  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Why secret?

463
00:49:15,820 --> 00:49:16,775  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Well,

464
00:49:17,140 --> 00:49:19,415  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
the baby girl was born
here in Madrid.

465
00:49:20,100 --> 00:49:22,375  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
But she was conceived
on a beach,

466
00:49:23,060 --> 00:49:24,288  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
on an island,

467
00:49:25,340 --> 00:49:26,932  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
a night like tonight,

468
00:49:28,140 --> 00:49:29,698  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
with a stranger...

469
00:49:29,900 --> 00:49:31,094  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
from Madrid.

470
00:49:32,140 --> 00:49:33,971  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
It was his birthday.

471
00:49:37,420 --> 00:49:39,980  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
If you write this well,
it'll be the story of your life

472
00:49:40,780 --> 00:49:43,135  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
and my birthday gift to you.

473
00:49:45,500 --> 00:49:49,254  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
I know where to find the kid.
Afternoons in a square.

474
00:49:50,660 --> 00:49:51,934  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Without the mother.

475
00:49:53,020 --> 00:49:54,339  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
What's her name?

476
00:49:54,540 --> 00:49:55,609  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
The mother?

477
00:49:55,820 --> 00:49:57,731  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
No, the daughter.

478
00:49:58,380 --> 00:49:59,859  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Your daughter's name is Luna.

479
00:50:02,860 --> 00:50:04,691  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Of course. Luna.

480
00:51:16,220 --> 00:51:17,255  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
What's your name?

481
00:51:18,380 --> 00:51:19,210  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Luna.

482
00:51:27,500 --> 00:51:29,218  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
What's the sun's name?

483
00:51:32,540 --> 00:51:34,451  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
-Lorenzo.
-Lorenzo.

484
00:51:35,860 --> 00:51:37,213  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Just like me.

485
00:51:37,580 --> 00:51:39,411  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
What's the moon's name?

486
00:51:39,620 --> 00:51:40,609  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
You want the job?

487
00:51:40,900 --> 00:51:41,696  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Yes.

488
00:51:42,020 --> 00:51:44,056  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Then the moon's name is Luna.

489
00:51:52,780 --> 00:51:54,577  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Today was an important day.

490
00:52:09,300 --> 00:52:10,779  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
You don't know your father?.

491
00:52:11,180 --> 00:52:12,693  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
You've never seen him?

492
00:52:13,820 --> 00:52:15,299  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Do you know his name?

493
00:52:17,380 --> 00:52:18,210  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
No.

494
00:52:19,620 --> 00:52:21,690  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Don't worry, names don't matter.

495
00:52:25,780 --> 00:52:27,054  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Would you like it if...

496
00:52:29,780 --> 00:52:30,895  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
...I were your dad?

497
00:52:33,900 --> 00:52:34,935  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Could you be?

498
00:52:35,580 --> 00:52:37,696  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Yeah, if you want me to be.

499
00:52:39,300 --> 00:52:40,528  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
But in secret.

500
00:52:40,980 --> 00:52:42,493  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
My real father?

501
00:52:46,740 --> 00:52:51,097  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
He thought it was a very big secret
for such a small little girl.

502
00:52:51,300 --> 00:52:52,813  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
His smile faded.

503
00:52:53,220 --> 00:52:56,690  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
Then he went over
and sat along side her.

504
00:52:56,980 --> 00:53:00,450  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
Do you know what happens
lf someone discovers the secret...

505
00:53:00,820 --> 00:53:02,936  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
...between the moon and the sun?

506
00:53:06,100 --> 00:53:07,658  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
The tide would drop...

507
00:53:08,860 --> 00:53:10,009  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
and drop...

508
00:53:11,180 --> 00:53:12,772  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
with a sound like:

509
00:53:24,420 --> 00:53:26,058  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Like mountains caving in.

510
00:53:33,820 --> 00:53:37,017  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
Maybe someday he'd find a 
way to tell her,

511
00:53:37,220 --> 00:53:40,257  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
so for the time being
he left it at that.

512
00:53:41,260 --> 00:53:43,490  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
What was the point of being a father...

513
00:53:43,740 --> 00:53:45,458  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
...If she didn't know?

514
00:53:48,380 --> 00:53:50,814  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
He knew then that
lf he'd told her,

515
00:53:51,500 --> 00:53:53,855  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
she'd have kept the secret.

516
00:53:56,300 --> 00:53:57,369  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Secret.

517
00:54:05,380 --> 00:54:06,654  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
You have a daughter?

518
00:54:09,020 --> 00:54:10,738  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Lorenzo, honey.

519
00:54:12,940 --> 00:54:13,850  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Do you?

520
00:54:15,260 --> 00:54:16,454  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Why do you ask?

521
00:54:16,980 --> 00:54:18,572  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
I saw it on your computer.

522
00:54:20,020 --> 00:54:21,169  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
And I loved it.

523
00:54:21,700 --> 00:54:23,497  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
I can't keep writing it.

524
00:54:23,740 --> 00:54:24,775  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Why not?

525
00:54:24,940 --> 00:54:26,817  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
I don't know what it is
to be a father.

526
00:54:27,020 --> 00:54:29,329  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Then make it up.

527
00:54:43,900 --> 00:54:45,970  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
I'm glad you're writing again.

528
00:54:46,540 --> 00:54:48,371  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
I was feeling guilty.

529
00:54:49,660 --> 00:54:51,173  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
None of it is your fault.

530
00:55:02,260 --> 00:55:04,091  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Luna doesn't know her dad.

531
00:55:05,380 --> 00:55:07,018  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
She lives alone with her mom?

532
00:55:07,180 --> 00:55:09,569  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
No, with a dumb soccer player.

533
00:55:12,620 --> 00:55:14,611  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
I've never seen my dad.

534
00:55:17,940 --> 00:55:19,009  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Me, neither.

535
00:55:21,700 --> 00:55:23,497  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
My mother's an actress.

536
00:55:23,980 --> 00:55:26,699  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
A porn actress.

537
00:55:28,900 --> 00:55:29,969  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
I like that.

538
00:55:30,340 --> 00:55:32,137  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
She quit last year.

539
00:55:32,740 --> 00:55:34,571  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
She met this amazing guy

540
00:55:34,900 --> 00:55:37,460  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
who was a client,
and fell for him.

541
00:55:38,620 --> 00:55:40,258  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Now we live together.

542
00:55:41,100 --> 00:55:42,897  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
He retired her.

543
00:55:43,540 --> 00:55:44,939  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Sounds nice.

544
00:55:45,420 --> 00:55:47,172  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
He's the sweetest guy...

545
00:55:47,380 --> 00:55:50,258  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
He has the biggest heart ever.

546
00:55:50,700 --> 00:55:52,531  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
And he's handsome.

547
00:55:52,940 --> 00:55:54,692  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
He's really sexy.

548
00:55:56,100 --> 00:55:57,294  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
You like him, too?

549
00:55:57,860 --> 00:55:58,736  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Me?

550
00:56:00,740 --> 00:56:02,219  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Why? Can you tell?

551
00:56:07,180 --> 00:56:08,454  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
You like him a lot?

552
00:56:09,860 --> 00:56:11,134  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Okay, drop it.

553
00:56:16,620 --> 00:56:18,133  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Would you do him?

554
00:56:18,340 --> 00:56:21,889  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
No! He's my mother's lover.

555
00:56:22,540 --> 00:56:24,815  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
Poor thing,
she's in love for once.

556
00:56:26,620 --> 00:56:28,611  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Do you think he likes you?

557
00:56:34,620 --> 00:56:37,976  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
If he offered,
and your mom never found out?

558
00:56:38,220 --> 00:56:39,892  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Just once, as a test.

559
00:56:40,460 --> 00:56:41,859  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
A test, right?

560
00:56:42,980 --> 00:56:45,096  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
This is between you and me.

561
00:56:48,340 --> 00:56:49,534  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Just once?

562
00:56:50,420 --> 00:56:52,695  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Yeah. Why not?

563
00:56:55,220 --> 00:56:58,576  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
Because. I don't know...
I hope I never get

564
00:56:59,100 --> 00:57:01,170  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
put to the test.

565
00:57:02,820 --> 00:57:05,380  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
But she put him to the test.

566
00:57:05,860 --> 00:57:08,738  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
One morning when her mother
was shopping,

567
00:57:09,620 --> 00:57:12,498  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
she took a shower
and left the door open.

568
00:58:00,420 --> 00:58:02,217  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
It almost happened.

569
00:58:02,420 --> 00:58:03,455  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
What did?

570
00:58:05,020 --> 00:58:06,817  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
The test. With Antonio.

571
00:58:10,180 --> 00:58:11,499  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Tell me about it.

572
00:58:13,740 --> 00:58:16,300  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
Last night,
when they went to bed,

573
00:58:17,580 --> 00:58:20,174  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
I put one of my mom's movies on.

574
00:58:21,380 --> 00:58:22,859  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
It's strange, but...

575
00:58:23,380 --> 00:58:25,655  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
Seeing her in action
gets me hot.

576
00:58:26,780 --> 00:58:28,372  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
You masturbated.

577
00:58:28,620 --> 00:58:30,212  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
You always guess.

578
00:58:32,100 --> 00:58:33,931  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
I took one of her dildos

579
00:58:34,140 --> 00:58:36,370  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
from her room while they slept.

580
00:58:39,020 --> 00:58:41,580  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
I lay naked on the sofa,

581
00:58:42,860 --> 00:58:44,009  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
in the dark,

582
00:58:44,460 --> 00:58:45,939  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
in front of the TV.

583
00:58:46,620 --> 00:58:49,180  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
I started copying
her sexual positions.

584
00:59:46,700 --> 00:59:48,338  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Their lust almost killed them.

585
00:59:51,220 --> 00:59:52,448  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
He covered her mouth

586
00:59:52,660 --> 00:59:54,730  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
so her mother wouldn't wake up.

587
01:00:23,740 --> 01:00:26,174  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
We decided not to tell my mom.

588
01:00:26,500 --> 01:00:28,889  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
And to never do it again.

589
01:00:30,820 --> 01:00:34,369  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
I promised Antonio
I'd find myself a boyfriend

590
01:00:34,860 --> 01:00:37,738  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
right away so I'd have someone
to play with.

591
01:00:41,140 --> 01:00:44,610  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
Here, I'll loan you my mom
for a couple days.

592
01:00:51,180 --> 01:00:53,455  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
I masturbated because of you,

593
01:00:53,620 --> 01:00:55,736  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
but ended up thinking of him.

594
01:00:57,060 --> 01:00:58,618  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
But we didn't do it.

595
01:00:59,540 --> 01:01:01,735  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
I'm not even sure I saw him.

596
01:01:02,940 --> 01:01:04,419  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
I just felt him.

597
01:01:04,620 --> 01:01:06,895  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Spying on me from behind.

598
01:01:08,260 --> 01:01:09,613  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
At least I think so.

599
01:01:45,580 --> 01:01:46,933  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
How nice!

600
01:01:47,380 --> 01:01:49,848  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
You never greet me
this way anymore.

601
01:01:52,820 --> 01:01:55,288  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
I should get home early
every night.

602
01:01:58,060 --> 01:01:59,334  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Your mom was great.

603
01:01:59,900 --> 01:02:01,219  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Quite an actress.

604
01:02:01,940 --> 01:02:02,975  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
You got off?

605
01:02:03,740 --> 01:02:04,650  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Yes.

606
01:02:06,180 --> 01:02:07,249  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
If only I'd seen you

607
01:02:09,380 --> 01:02:11,211  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
through a small hole in the wall.

608
01:02:12,020 --> 01:02:13,851  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Are you Belén's boyfriend?

609
01:02:16,140 --> 01:02:17,619  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Would you like him to be?

610
01:02:17,820 --> 01:02:19,139  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Yeah, sure.

611
01:02:20,260 --> 01:02:21,613  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Then that's that.

612
01:02:39,380 --> 01:02:40,779  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
I have to sleep...

613
01:02:40,980 --> 01:02:43,414  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
...at Luna's tonight.
Her parents are going out.

614
01:02:47,420 --> 01:02:50,298  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
I can ask if my boyfriend
can come along.

615
01:02:51,220 --> 01:02:52,414  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
She's really cool.

616
01:02:54,580 --> 01:02:56,093  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
What's her name?

617
01:02:56,700 --> 01:02:57,735  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Elena.

618
01:02:59,260 --> 01:03:00,295  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Well,

619
01:03:02,220 --> 01:03:05,656  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
I'd prefer just to see you and Luna,
no one else.

620
01:03:15,020 --> 01:03:16,373  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Why the boyfriend?

621
01:03:16,580 --> 01:03:18,218  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Can't they wait?

622
01:03:18,420 --> 01:03:21,218  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
She asked me as a special favor.
Maybe they can't.

623
01:03:21,420 --> 01:03:23,092  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
-They'll fuck.
-Good for them.

624
01:03:23,620 --> 01:03:26,339  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
We don't even know him.
And in our bed?

625
01:03:27,820 --> 01:03:29,856  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
You're just like your dog.

626
01:03:34,980 --> 01:03:37,289  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
Hi, boyfriend.
The doors are open.

627
01:03:45,740 --> 01:03:48,652  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
Be nice to him or 
I'll have to castrate you.

628
01:03:48,860 --> 01:03:49,975  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
You hear me?

629
01:04:03,500 --> 01:04:04,569  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Delicious.

630
01:04:05,500 --> 01:04:06,819  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
You're a great cook.

631
01:04:10,860 --> 01:04:13,215  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
And what do you do?

632
01:04:21,900 --> 01:04:23,492  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
You won't tell me?

633
01:04:31,260 --> 01:04:32,818  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
I'll get it out later.

634
01:04:41,900 --> 01:04:43,492  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
I want some water.

635
01:04:47,740 --> 01:04:50,334  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
Before I met Luna
I thought I'd never have kids.

636
01:04:53,340 --> 01:04:55,490  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
Wouldn't you want
a daughter like her?

637
01:04:59,060 --> 01:05:00,095  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Of course.

638
01:05:01,220 --> 01:05:02,016  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
To me...

639
01:05:03,740 --> 01:05:05,093  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
You'll always be my first.

640
01:05:06,060 --> 01:05:06,890  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
And to you?

641
01:05:08,180 --> 01:05:09,738  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
The first and only.

642
01:05:37,300 --> 01:05:38,528  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Can I watch TV?

643
01:05:41,420 --> 01:05:42,933  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
It's late, go to bed.

644
01:05:44,700 --> 01:05:46,452  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
If Lorenzo tucks me in.

645
01:05:46,780 --> 01:05:49,010  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
You'll have to show me where.

646
01:05:52,860 --> 01:05:53,656  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
And a kiss?

647
01:06:20,660 --> 01:06:24,255  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
-Can you tell stories?
-Of course, that's my job.

648
01:06:49,940 --> 01:06:52,898  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
Did you know that island
has the lowest moon?

649
01:06:55,540 --> 01:06:58,054  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
That's right.
But only a few of us...

650
01:06:58,260 --> 01:07:00,649  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
...in the world know it.
It also has...

651
01:07:00,860 --> 01:07:03,658  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
great weather,
and it grants wishes.

652
01:07:04,460 --> 01:07:07,611  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
If you need something,
the rocks below the shore...

653
01:07:07,820 --> 01:07:09,617  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
...give it to you as a gift.

654
01:07:10,660 --> 01:07:13,379  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
But watch out for the holes
in the ground.

655
01:07:16,820 --> 01:07:18,617  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
Though it doesn't matter,
because...

656
01:07:18,820 --> 01:07:20,412  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
...no one ever dies there.

657
01:07:20,620 --> 01:07:24,499  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
For example, if you fall,
you can choose any life you want.

658
01:07:24,900 --> 01:07:26,731  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
You can be your favorite fish.

659
01:07:52,644 --> 01:07:55,522  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
The island was glad
when the girl arrived,

660
01:07:55,684 --> 01:07:57,515  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
especially the rocks
below the shore,

661
01:07:57,684 --> 01:08:00,152  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
so they decided
to give her something.

662
01:08:00,364 --> 01:08:01,274  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
But what?

663
01:08:03,124 --> 01:08:04,239  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
A raft.

664
01:08:04,844 --> 01:08:05,993  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Bigger.

665
01:08:07,204 --> 01:08:08,114  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
A dog.

666
01:08:08,444 --> 01:08:11,004  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
No. Something she didn't have.

667
01:08:11,644 --> 01:08:12,759  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Her father.

668
01:08:14,844 --> 01:08:16,960  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Bull's-eye, butterfly.

669
01:08:49,164 --> 01:08:51,280  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Tonight you keep watch outside.

670
01:08:55,404 --> 01:08:57,395  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
All she had to do was

671
01:08:57,724 --> 01:09:00,875  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
Iook everywhere for him
until she found him.

672
01:09:02,084 --> 01:09:04,882  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
Her father could be
whoever she wanted.

673
01:09:07,564 --> 01:09:10,442  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
But then the girl had doubts,
like everyone.

674
01:09:10,924 --> 01:09:14,314  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
Would she choose a lighthouse 
keeper-daddy or a fisherman-daddy?

675
01:09:14,804 --> 01:09:17,557  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
She knew one thing:
what she really wanted...

676
01:09:17,764 --> 01:09:20,961  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
...was her mother to become
a beautiful mermaid.

677
01:09:30,804 --> 01:09:32,032  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
She's asleep.

678
01:09:40,924 --> 01:09:43,643  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Belén, I want you to know something.

679
01:09:46,044 --> 01:09:48,512  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
I changed into this,
do you mind?

680
01:13:36,844 --> 01:13:38,835  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Hi, It's Elena.

681
01:13:39,524 --> 01:13:40,877  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Is Belén there?

682
01:13:41,644 --> 01:13:42,520  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Yes.

683
01:13:43,444 --> 01:13:44,797  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
It's Elena.

684
01:13:52,604 --> 01:13:53,514  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Hello?

685
01:13:54,124 --> 01:13:56,354  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
-How are you?
-Better.

686
01:13:56,564 --> 01:13:58,361  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
I'm improving.

687
01:13:59,724 --> 01:14:00,759  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
And you?

688
01:14:01,324 --> 01:14:03,440  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Well, I haven't cried.

689
01:14:04,444 --> 01:14:06,753  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
I can't.
I haven't seen her.

690
01:14:06,964 --> 01:14:10,001  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
They told me,
but I don't understand.

691
01:14:10,724 --> 01:14:13,796  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
I don't want to imagine it.
That's why I came here.

692
01:14:14,084 --> 01:14:17,599  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
To be closer to her
by swimming in the sea.

693
01:14:21,404 --> 01:14:22,439  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Cry, Belén.

694
01:14:23,084 --> 01:14:24,403  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Now that you can.

695
01:14:28,764 --> 01:14:31,483  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
It helps me to hear you cry.

696
01:14:34,284 --> 01:14:35,512  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
That's lt.

697
01:14:35,844 --> 01:14:36,799  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Cry.

698
01:14:36,964 --> 01:14:37,840  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Cry.

699
01:14:38,164 --> 01:14:39,517  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
You need to cry.

700
01:14:42,444 --> 01:14:44,116  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
She hears you, too.

701
01:14:45,524 --> 01:14:48,322  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
A big kiss from the sea...

702
01:14:48,764 --> 01:14:50,038  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
from both of us.

703
01:15:00,444 --> 01:15:02,639  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Lately you're always in bed.

704
01:15:02,844 --> 01:15:04,402  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
You know what time it is?

705
01:15:06,684 --> 01:15:09,676  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
It's a beautiful day.
Sunny and clear.

706
01:15:11,444 --> 01:15:13,036  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
And it's my day off.

707
01:15:13,604 --> 01:15:15,435  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Get up, lazybones!

708
01:15:19,804 --> 01:15:20,919  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Do you need all...

709
01:15:21,084 --> 01:15:22,995  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
...these pills just to sleep?

710
01:15:24,124 --> 01:15:26,797  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
You never had problems
sleeping before.

711
01:15:30,084 --> 01:15:31,437  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Lorenzo, honey.

712
01:15:32,964 --> 01:15:36,400  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
I'm worried about you.
You've been depressed for days.

713
01:15:36,604 --> 01:15:37,798  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Trouble with the novel?

714
01:15:39,404 --> 01:15:40,473  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Is that it?

715
01:15:42,684 --> 01:15:44,242  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
You look terrible.

716
01:15:45,564 --> 01:15:46,713  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Something's happened.

717
01:15:46,924 --> 01:15:47,879  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
What?

718
01:15:51,924 --> 01:15:53,118  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
You're sweating.

719
01:15:53,844 --> 01:15:56,916  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
I've left,
and there's no coming back.

720
01:15:57,124 --> 01:15:58,159  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Your life...

721
01:15:58,364 --> 01:16:00,275  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
...is more important
than your novel.

722
01:16:00,444 --> 01:16:01,797  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Than any novel.

723
01:16:02,004 --> 01:16:05,235  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
Writing is vital to you, but
you need to take care of yourself.

724
01:16:05,604 --> 01:16:09,882  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
You're too good a person to see
the shit I have inside.

725
01:16:10,044 --> 01:16:10,999  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Stop, that's enough.

726
01:16:11,204 --> 01:16:12,353  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
I have a confession.

727
01:16:12,564 --> 01:16:14,714  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
So you see how close I am.

728
01:16:15,684 --> 01:16:17,242  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
I've been reading the novel.

729
01:16:17,924 --> 01:16:19,516  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Everything you've written.

730
01:16:19,684 --> 01:16:22,801  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
At night, when you're asleep.
Do you mind?

731
01:16:23,484 --> 01:16:24,519  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
I understand

732
01:16:24,724 --> 01:16:27,397  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
why you're so affected,
why you reject it,

733
01:16:27,604 --> 01:16:29,754  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
and why it's hard for you
to go on.

734
01:16:29,964 --> 01:16:32,034  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
It can't be easy, living there,

735
01:16:32,204 --> 01:16:33,557  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
in that house,

736
01:16:33,764 --> 01:16:35,914  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
with that stormy relationship.

737
01:16:36,084 --> 01:16:39,633  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
So much repressed desire,
impossible to control.

738
01:16:40,764 --> 01:16:43,961  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
He's coming between
a mother and her daughter,

739
01:16:44,164 --> 01:16:45,722  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
breaking a sacred bond.

740
01:16:46,044 --> 01:16:49,317  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
But the passion's there, too.
The promptings of the blood bombing.

741
01:16:55,964 --> 01:16:57,636  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
I identify with her.

742
01:16:57,844 --> 01:17:00,074  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
I understand exactly
how she feels.

743
01:17:00,404 --> 01:17:02,998  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Disgusted, guilty, selfish...

744
01:17:03,204 --> 01:17:04,353  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Her mom's jealousy...

745
01:17:04,564 --> 01:17:06,555  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
But she's forced to choose...

746
01:17:06,724 --> 01:17:09,033  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
...between passionate love
for a man,

747
01:17:09,244 --> 01:17:10,757  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
and love for a mother.

748
01:17:11,324 --> 01:17:15,033  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
I'd have chosen the same.
Such decisions are made

749
01:17:15,244 --> 01:17:16,916  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
by gut instinct.

750
01:17:17,124 --> 01:17:18,113  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Sex...

751
01:17:18,284 --> 01:17:20,593  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
The thick, burning lust

752
01:17:20,844 --> 01:17:22,163  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
filled the mother,

753
01:17:22,364 --> 01:17:23,922  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
the man and the daughter.

754
01:17:25,564 --> 01:17:26,792  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
They were sex-crazed.

755
01:17:26,964 --> 01:17:28,716  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
The stench of raw sex...

756
01:17:29,684 --> 01:17:30,639  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
The mother and the man,

757
01:17:34,404 --> 01:17:35,553  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
the man and the daughter,

758
01:17:36,444 --> 01:17:37,593  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
the daughter and the man.

759
01:17:38,884 --> 01:17:40,078  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
All the man's poisoned love...

760
01:17:40,284 --> 01:17:43,003  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
Alone with the daughter,
the daughter and the man...

761
01:17:43,164 --> 01:17:44,313  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
The smell was...

762
01:17:44,524 --> 01:17:46,833  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
heavy, hot, overwhelming...

763
01:17:47,044 --> 01:17:47,999  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Stuffy...

764
01:17:48,204 --> 01:17:49,478  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Stale air.

765
01:17:50,684 --> 01:17:51,753  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Exhausted...

766
01:18:02,804 --> 01:18:05,272  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
The paint fell from the corners
of the room...

767
01:18:05,644 --> 01:18:07,794  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
...and the walls became rocky,

768
01:18:08,924 --> 01:18:10,721  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Iike those in a cave.

769
01:18:11,804 --> 01:18:13,840  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
A filthy den of...

770
01:18:15,484 --> 01:18:16,360  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Get out!

771
01:18:18,364 --> 01:18:19,240  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Relax.

772
01:18:20,484 --> 01:18:22,952  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
Just wanted to let you know
that I'm here.

773
01:18:41,044 --> 01:18:43,558  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
The man was selfish, a coward.

774
01:18:44,124 --> 01:18:48,117  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
He hated himself so deeply,
so utterly, there wasn't even...

775
01:18:48,524 --> 01:18:50,355  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
...time for forgiveness.

776
01:18:51,164 --> 01:18:52,882  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Only time for death.

777
01:18:53,244 --> 01:18:54,836  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Death, death,

778
01:18:55,804 --> 01:18:57,635  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
death, death.

779
01:18:58,724 --> 01:18:59,759  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Belén's fine.

780
01:19:00,004 --> 01:19:02,120  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
She's home with her family.

781
01:19:02,564 --> 01:19:04,236  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Forget the whole thing.

782
01:19:04,524 --> 01:19:06,003  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
You've suffered enough.

783
01:19:07,404 --> 01:19:09,440  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Will I ever read the novel?

784
01:19:09,604 --> 01:19:10,559  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Of course.

785
01:19:14,204 --> 01:19:15,273  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Another thing.

786
01:19:16,524 --> 01:19:18,515  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Tell me about Elena, too.

787
01:19:18,924 --> 01:19:20,801  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
My sister writes to her on-line.

788
01:19:21,004 --> 01:19:23,996  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
She's on that Mediterranean
cooking chat everyday.

789
01:19:24,204 --> 01:19:26,354  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
-Her nick is "Alsi".
-"Alsi"?

790
01:19:26,564 --> 01:19:27,440  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
A-L-S-I.

791
01:19:29,604 --> 01:19:32,277  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
That's Spanish
for "island" backwards.

792
01:19:32,564 --> 01:19:34,475  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Hi, Alsi. How are you?

793
01:19:37,484 --> 01:19:38,883  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
I don't know you.

794
01:19:39,564 --> 01:19:42,317  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
It's better that way.
I'm here to help.

795
01:19:44,964 --> 01:19:45,999  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
What's your nick?

796
01:19:46,164 --> 01:19:47,916  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
I don't understand the icon.

797
01:19:48,764 --> 01:19:50,880  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
It's a lighthouse for your island.

798
01:19:51,084 --> 01:19:52,437  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Are you the keeper?

799
01:19:52,764 --> 01:19:53,799  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Yeah.

800
01:19:55,364 --> 01:19:58,720  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
I have a story for you,
it's full of advantages.

801
01:19:59,644 --> 01:20:00,838  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
I'd like that.

802
01:20:02,724 --> 01:20:03,634  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Thanks.

803
01:20:06,444 --> 01:20:09,595  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
The first advantage
is at the end of the story.

804
01:20:09,804 --> 01:20:12,921  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
It doesn't finish,
it falls in a hole.

805
01:20:15,684 --> 01:20:18,437  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
And the story
starts again halfway.

806
01:20:19,604 --> 01:20:21,879  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
The other advantage,
and the biggest,

807
01:20:22,684 --> 01:20:25,721  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
Is that you can change 
course along the way...

808
01:20:26,044 --> 01:20:28,797  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
If you let me.
If you give me time.

809
01:20:31,164 --> 01:20:34,076  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
All the time you want.

810
01:20:35,484 --> 01:20:37,156  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Go on, please.

811
01:21:11,524 --> 01:21:12,798  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
To be continued.

812
01:21:21,604 --> 01:21:23,879  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
What happened?
Why are you so late?

813
01:21:24,044 --> 01:21:26,000  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
My boss invited me to dinner.

814
01:21:26,204 --> 01:21:28,718  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
He wanted me to try a new dish.

815
01:21:29,124 --> 01:21:30,557  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Did you screw him?

816
01:21:31,084 --> 01:21:32,153  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
What?

817
01:21:33,084 --> 01:21:35,200  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Did you go to bed with him?

818
01:21:39,204 --> 01:21:42,241  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
That's right, you guessed it.

819
01:21:46,964 --> 01:21:48,761  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
And how was it?

820
01:21:49,204 --> 01:21:51,195  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
-Tell me about it.
-No.

821
01:21:51,644 --> 01:21:52,838  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
You first.

822
01:21:53,724 --> 01:21:55,123  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
What's going on?

823
01:21:55,324 --> 01:21:56,552  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
What's your problem?

824
01:21:57,444 --> 01:21:59,514  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
I lost track of you ages ago.

825
01:22:00,044 --> 01:22:01,523  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
You're not alive!

826
01:22:02,844 --> 01:22:04,402  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Was it the first time with him?

827
01:22:05,844 --> 01:22:06,879  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
The second.

828
01:22:07,804 --> 01:22:09,920  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
The first was before we met.

829
01:22:10,884 --> 01:22:12,442  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
Or should I say
before I proposed?

830
01:22:12,924 --> 01:22:14,516  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
So it doesn't count.

831
01:22:17,004 --> 01:22:20,394  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
You could have told me before.

832
01:22:21,084 --> 01:22:22,961  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Yeah, I could have.

833
01:22:24,444 --> 01:22:25,354  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
And today?

834
01:22:27,084 --> 01:22:28,039  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Well...

835
01:22:29,444 --> 01:22:31,082  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
It doesn't count, either.

836
01:22:31,364 --> 01:22:32,319  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
It's a lie.

837
01:22:33,364 --> 01:22:34,956  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
But we came close.

838
01:22:37,884 --> 01:22:38,760  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
How close?

839
01:22:40,164 --> 01:22:41,643  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Did you stop or did he?

840
01:22:41,964 --> 01:22:44,558  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
What about you stopping with me?

841
01:22:55,804 --> 01:22:58,955  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Lorenzo, do you love me?

842
01:22:59,964 --> 01:23:03,274  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
I need to hear you say it
right now.

843
01:23:07,524 --> 01:23:09,754  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Yes. Deeply.

844
01:23:10,804 --> 01:23:13,318  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
More than myself. But I'm lost.

845
01:23:14,844 --> 01:23:16,436  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Then let me help you.

846
01:23:16,804 --> 01:23:18,396  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
You don't deserve this.

847
01:23:18,604 --> 01:23:20,913  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Why not? I'm your girlfriend,

848
01:23:21,804 --> 01:23:23,920  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
and I love you more than myself.

849
01:23:24,084 --> 01:23:26,678  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
Come on, it's obvious.
You're draining my life away.

850
01:23:26,844 --> 01:23:30,154  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
I'm doing all I can to get back,
and accept myself,

851
01:23:30,364 --> 01:23:32,082  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
but if I can't,

852
01:23:32,644 --> 01:23:34,396  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
don't wait for me.

853
01:23:36,244 --> 01:23:38,041  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
I wouldn't, either.

854
01:23:39,724 --> 01:23:41,203  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
What happened to you?

855
01:23:46,804 --> 01:23:48,760  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Belén, it's Elena.

856
01:23:50,804 --> 01:23:51,839  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
How are you?

857
01:23:53,564 --> 01:23:54,838  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
It's real hot here.

858
01:23:55,044 --> 01:23:57,512  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
Why don't you come out?
The sea will do you good.

859
01:23:57,724 --> 01:24:00,397  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
I have a guesthouse
for the whole summer.

860
01:24:00,764 --> 01:24:04,200  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
I'll have a room free in August.
Upstairs.

861
01:24:04,484 --> 01:24:06,759  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
My best room.
You'll watch the sunset...

862
01:24:06,964 --> 01:24:09,797  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
...from your bed.
Bring someone if you want.

863
01:24:10,404 --> 01:24:11,280  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Well?

864
01:24:11,684 --> 01:24:14,721  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
The truth is,
I'd love to visit an island...

865
01:24:16,324 --> 01:24:17,439  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
with someone.

866
01:24:17,884 --> 01:24:19,033  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Then that's it.

867
01:24:20,524 --> 01:24:22,799  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
-It's difficult, Elena.
-Dlfficult?

868
01:24:23,004 --> 01:24:26,155  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
Nothing is here.
All the bad's left behind.

869
01:24:26,364 --> 01:24:28,639  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
-Just bring along the good.
-Right.

870
01:24:30,204 --> 01:24:31,432  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
The good up front.

871
01:24:32,324 --> 01:24:33,837  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
I really want to see you,

872
01:24:34,044 --> 01:24:34,954  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
but here.

873
01:24:36,084 --> 01:24:37,881  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
I don't want to lose touch.

874
01:24:40,284 --> 01:24:41,763  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Say you'll come.

875
01:24:42,764 --> 01:24:43,833  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Promise me.

876
01:24:46,324 --> 01:24:47,393  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
I promise

877
01:24:47,884 --> 01:24:49,078  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
I'll try.

878
01:24:50,204 --> 01:24:51,273  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Good bye.

879
01:25:23,084 --> 01:25:25,837  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
Forgive me, Lucía.
I've got to end this.

880
01:25:27,844 --> 01:25:30,916  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
I'm going to kill them
for once and for all.

881
01:25:31,564 --> 01:25:32,599  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Both of them.

882
01:25:34,524 --> 01:25:35,513  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Right now.

883
01:25:54,524 --> 01:25:57,482  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
If you've stopped being a writer,
you have to...

884
01:25:57,644 --> 01:25:58,713  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
...explain why.

885
01:26:00,964 --> 01:26:02,113  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
You're holding back.

886
01:26:06,924 --> 01:26:08,039  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
If you don't tell me,

887
01:26:08,244 --> 01:26:09,472  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
I'll never forgive you!

888
01:26:09,684 --> 01:26:11,083  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
You hear me? Never!

889
01:26:11,484 --> 01:26:12,678  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
I can't talk like this.

890
01:26:12,884 --> 01:26:13,714  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Talk?

891
01:26:15,284 --> 01:26:17,718  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
You're the one who won't talk.

892
01:26:18,684 --> 01:26:20,515  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
You keep it all inside.

893
01:26:20,684 --> 01:26:22,640  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
You won't let me help you.

894
01:26:23,084 --> 01:26:24,312  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Everything's you.

895
01:26:24,484 --> 01:26:26,281  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
I'm crumpled up in the corner.

896
01:26:27,284 --> 01:26:28,160  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Look.

897
01:26:28,484 --> 01:26:30,076  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
You were meant to live alone,

898
01:26:31,724 --> 01:26:32,952  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
and to suffer alone.

899
01:26:33,844 --> 01:26:38,000  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
And to poison yourself with your fucking 
doubts, which I don't understand.

900
01:26:38,084 --> 01:26:39,756  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
You're sick, Lorenzo.

901
01:26:40,244 --> 01:26:44,601  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
Sick of yourself, of your
own standards, and nothing else.

902
01:26:45,364 --> 01:26:46,956  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Of your fucking secrets!

903
01:26:47,444 --> 01:26:49,912  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
You keep me around,
but in the dark.

904
01:26:51,124 --> 01:26:52,876  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
Because my complaints
don't count.

905
01:26:53,644 --> 01:26:54,997  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Because you don't give

906
01:26:55,164 --> 01:26:56,995  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
a fuck what happens to me.

907
01:26:57,164 --> 01:26:58,916  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Your troubles are so deep,

908
01:26:59,324 --> 01:27:00,837  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
I'm fucking stupid,

909
01:27:01,004 --> 01:27:03,677  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
and all you care about
is if I screw my boss or not.

910
01:27:09,604 --> 01:27:10,957  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
I'm exhausted.

911
01:27:11,884 --> 01:27:13,237  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
You're driving me nuts.

912
01:27:13,564 --> 01:27:15,156  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
I'll be late to work.

913
01:27:17,764 --> 01:27:19,117  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Enjoy your hole.

914
01:27:21,204 --> 01:27:23,320  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Have fun rotting by yourself.

915
01:27:31,764 --> 01:27:34,039  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Look, I've never been this mean

916
01:27:34,244 --> 01:27:35,438  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
to anyone.

917
01:27:36,604 --> 01:27:38,879  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
It's the last time
I'll let myself talk like this.

918
01:27:39,404 --> 01:27:41,042  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
It's for me, not you.

919
01:27:44,524 --> 01:27:45,593  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
That's right.

920
01:27:47,564 --> 01:27:49,680  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
It's time to think of myself,

921
01:27:50,204 --> 01:27:51,603  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
of my own needs.

922
01:27:52,764 --> 01:27:55,232  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Because I see no future with you.

923
01:28:45,004 --> 01:28:45,720  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Lucía!

924
01:28:48,284 --> 01:28:50,479  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
Come over here
and lie next to me.

925
01:29:22,004 --> 01:29:23,517  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Relax, Lucía.

926
01:29:24,164 --> 01:29:26,632  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Let the mud absorb all the bad.

927
01:29:27,044 --> 01:29:29,922  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Later it'll wash away in the sea.

928
01:30:04,164 --> 01:30:05,438  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
I don't want sex.

929
01:30:07,844 --> 01:30:09,323  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
I'm not ready yet.

930
01:30:19,004 --> 01:30:20,232  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Don't worry.

931
01:30:23,044 --> 01:30:25,035  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
We'll just lie here,

932
01:30:27,204 --> 01:30:28,956  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
drying out in the sun.

933
01:30:38,364 --> 01:30:40,480  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Yeah, he looks like Carlos.

934
01:30:48,204 --> 01:30:50,957  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
"Missing for 6 months".

935
01:30:51,484 --> 01:30:53,634  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
"Manuela and Belén Lozano,
mother and daughter,

936
01:30:53,844 --> 01:30:56,563  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
and Antonio Castillo,
were all living together.

937
01:30:56,764 --> 01:31:01,155  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
If anyone knows where they are,
please contact the police."

938
01:31:01,644 --> 01:31:02,633  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
The police?

939
01:31:02,804 --> 01:31:03,998  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
We'll...

940
01:31:04,604 --> 01:31:06,435  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
act like we didn't see this,

941
01:31:07,164 --> 01:31:08,882  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Iike nothing's happened.

942
01:31:13,484 --> 01:31:15,315  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
We know he lived with two women.

943
01:31:15,724 --> 01:31:17,237  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Mother and daughter.

944
01:31:17,444 --> 01:31:19,082  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Yeah, and the daughter...

945
01:31:21,084 --> 01:31:21,960  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
What?

946
01:31:23,884 --> 01:31:26,557  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
The daughter was taking care of...

947
01:31:27,164 --> 01:31:28,438  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
my daughter.

948
01:31:39,084 --> 01:31:41,075  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
They left without him,

949
01:31:41,404 --> 01:31:43,713  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
quietly, without saying goodbye.

950
01:31:44,084 --> 01:31:45,961  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
As he slept,

951
01:31:46,124 --> 01:31:47,352  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
like in a dream.

952
01:31:47,844 --> 01:31:50,438  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
When he woke, he felt
the two lifeless women...

953
01:31:51,124 --> 01:31:52,443  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
..were still with him,

954
01:31:53,244 --> 01:31:54,563  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
like any morning

955
01:31:55,004 --> 01:31:56,278  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
at that hour.

956
01:31:56,924 --> 01:31:59,563  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
And he lay still,
wishing his life would also...

957
01:31:59,764 --> 01:32:02,676  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
...leave him, through his blood.

958
01:32:03,324 --> 01:32:05,474  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
What good was his blood now?

959
01:32:06,484 --> 01:32:08,952  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
He wished it softly,
wlthout real intent.

960
01:32:09,804 --> 01:32:11,874  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
And he chose to escape,
to start over,

961
01:32:12,364 --> 01:32:13,479  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
to be new.

962
01:32:13,684 --> 01:32:15,481  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
To change his whole blood.

963
01:32:15,684 --> 01:32:17,003  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
So he said goodbye

964
01:32:17,724 --> 01:32:18,634  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
and left.

965
01:32:22,924 --> 01:32:24,721  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
We should give him a chance.

966
01:32:26,924 --> 01:32:28,721  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Don't we all deserve one?

967
01:32:31,004 --> 01:32:32,801  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Just in case, if in doubt,

968
01:32:33,844 --> 01:32:35,960  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
isn't it better to trust people?

969
01:32:36,444 --> 01:32:37,354  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Right?

970
01:32:40,484 --> 01:32:43,362  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
So when he gets back,
we'll ask him to explain.

971
01:32:43,964 --> 01:32:45,363  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
It's better this way.

972
01:32:46,164 --> 01:32:48,314  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
-Especially for you.
-For me?

973
01:32:48,964 --> 01:32:50,795  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
I just want to forget.

974
01:32:52,204 --> 01:32:54,001  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
You can't forget some things.

975
01:32:54,164 --> 01:32:57,201  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
In this house you can.
That's why we're here.

976
01:32:58,764 --> 01:33:00,117  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Then it's too late.

977
01:33:01,164 --> 01:33:03,280  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
I should have come before.

978
01:33:04,724 --> 01:33:06,077  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
When there was time...

979
01:33:09,324 --> 01:33:10,359  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
for Lorenzo.

980
01:33:13,284 --> 01:33:15,673  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
I wanted him to show me
the island.

981
01:33:16,684 --> 01:33:19,118  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
I asked him to, but he wouldn't.

982
01:33:21,804 --> 01:33:24,034  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
It would have been
his birthday soon.

983
01:33:29,444 --> 01:33:31,594  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
-What day?
-The 23rd.

984
01:33:42,124 --> 01:33:42,920  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Of May?

985
01:33:49,044 --> 01:33:50,762  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
We could have celebrated

986
01:33:51,084 --> 01:33:52,437  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
here on the island.

987
01:33:52,684 --> 01:33:53,753  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Maybe even with you.

988
01:33:55,124 --> 01:33:56,159  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Who knows if

989
01:33:56,364 --> 01:33:58,241  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
we'd have met, right?

990
01:33:58,964 --> 01:33:59,840  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Right.

991
01:34:02,604 --> 01:34:03,957  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
When was Lorenzo here?

992
01:34:05,884 --> 01:34:07,203  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
A long time ago.

993
01:34:08,564 --> 01:34:10,043  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Before we met.

994
01:34:10,364 --> 01:34:11,433  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
How long ago?

995
01:34:11,924 --> 01:34:14,313  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
About six years ago.

996
01:34:16,244 --> 01:34:17,199  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Yeah.

997
01:34:17,404 --> 01:34:18,883  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
I think he turned 25 here.

998
01:34:20,724 --> 01:34:21,600  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Lucía...

999
01:34:23,084 --> 01:34:23,994  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
What is it?

1000
01:34:26,284 --> 01:34:27,763  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
I'm overwhelmed...

1001
01:34:28,164 --> 01:34:29,961  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
But I can't cry.

1002
01:34:31,124 --> 01:34:32,159  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Don't worry.

1003
01:34:32,564 --> 01:34:34,122  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
You don't have to.

1004
01:34:34,964 --> 01:34:37,194  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
I'm the one
who should cry over him.

1005
01:34:44,924 --> 01:34:46,323  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
I'll just faint, then.

1006
01:34:48,724 --> 01:34:49,839  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
It's the sea.

1007
01:34:50,444 --> 01:34:52,162  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Must be high tide.

1008
01:35:03,484 --> 01:35:05,156  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
I'll never cry again.

1009
01:35:09,124 --> 01:35:10,443  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
I'm going to bed.

1010
01:35:21,284 --> 01:35:22,353  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
What's going on?

1011
01:36:07,284 --> 01:36:08,512  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
"Luna,

1012
01:36:08,724 --> 01:36:10,840  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
spring of 1988".

1013
01:36:15,084 --> 01:36:15,994  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Luna.

1014
01:36:27,484 --> 01:36:29,952  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
"Why bother being a father

1015
01:36:30,724 --> 01:36:32,203  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
if she didn't know?"

1016
01:36:34,124 --> 01:36:36,638  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
He knew then that
lf he'd told her,

1017
01:36:37,364 --> 01:36:39,514  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
she'd have kept the secret.

1018
01:36:44,524 --> 01:36:46,594  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
Lucía, never talk to me
about this.

1019
01:36:47,124 --> 01:36:48,921  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
I don't want to hear it.

1020
01:37:01,284 --> 01:37:02,353  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Well, I do.

1021
01:38:01,764 --> 01:38:03,117  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
He's out diving.

1022
01:38:05,604 --> 01:38:06,957  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Beneath the island.

1023
01:38:09,724 --> 01:38:11,123  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Do you like Carlos?

1024
01:38:13,004 --> 01:38:14,403  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
I don't anymore.

1025
01:38:14,924 --> 01:38:18,599  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
Go ahead, he's all yours.
I won't even be jealous.

1026
01:38:23,644 --> 01:38:24,997  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
What are you doing?

1027
01:38:26,884 --> 01:38:28,556  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Asking a friend for advice.

1028
01:38:28,764 --> 01:38:30,117  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
I don't know him,

1029
01:38:30,364 --> 01:38:32,400  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
but I'm getting to like him.

1030
01:38:38,324 --> 01:38:41,634  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
He's been writing me since
I got here. He made up...

1031
01:38:41,844 --> 01:38:43,960  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
...a sweet story to help me.

1032
01:38:44,364 --> 01:38:46,161  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
He taught me to forget.

1033
01:38:46,364 --> 01:38:47,843  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
And to escape pain.

1034
01:38:50,764 --> 01:38:51,799  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Want to read it?

1035
01:38:53,044 --> 01:38:54,272  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
You could get into it.

1036
01:38:54,964 --> 01:38:57,000  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
It's full of advantages.

1037
01:38:57,804 --> 01:38:58,839  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Because in the end...

1038
01:38:59,364 --> 01:39:00,399  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
there's a hole

1039
01:39:00,884 --> 01:39:02,840  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
to escape through.

1040
01:39:08,964 --> 01:39:10,158  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Back to the middle.

1041
01:39:12,124 --> 01:39:13,921  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
To change course,

1042
01:39:15,164 --> 01:39:16,199  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
if you want.

1043
01:39:23,084 --> 01:39:26,360  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
That's his icon,
it's a lighthouse.

1044
01:39:28,404 --> 01:39:30,440  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
But it has no keeper,

1045
01:39:31,364 --> 01:39:33,400  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
it must be a computer.

1046
01:39:34,964 --> 01:39:36,192  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Maybe his.

1047
01:39:43,804 --> 01:39:45,874  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
You'll meet my daughter.

1048
01:39:50,884 --> 01:39:52,283  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
I can't read this.

1049
01:39:52,644 --> 01:39:53,633  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Why not?

1050
01:39:58,284 --> 01:40:00,081  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
It will grab me.

1051
01:40:01,004 --> 01:40:02,483  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
And won't let go.

1052
01:40:02,964 --> 01:40:04,192  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
That's good.

1053
01:40:05,764 --> 01:40:07,402  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Did you finally do it?

1054
01:40:07,684 --> 01:40:08,719  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Do what?

1055
01:40:09,004 --> 01:40:10,357  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Change course?

1056
01:40:11,924 --> 01:40:14,802  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
Not all the way,
there wasn't time.

1057
01:40:15,684 --> 01:40:17,276  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
That's why I'm writing him.

1058
01:40:19,724 --> 01:40:22,192  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
WHERE'S THE KEEPER?

1059
01:40:23,444 --> 01:40:24,638  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Don't write him.

1060
01:40:28,084 --> 01:40:30,837  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
There's nothing more the poor man can do.

1061
01:40:39,324 --> 01:40:42,361  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
Has he written you
since I first got here?

1062
01:41:47,564 --> 01:41:50,362  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Hi, Lorenzo. How are you?

1063
01:41:52,004 --> 01:41:53,642  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Your face says it all.

1064
01:41:53,804 --> 01:41:55,999  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
They called to say
you were more awake.

1065
01:41:59,484 --> 01:42:00,758  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Do you know who I am?

1066
01:42:02,044 --> 01:42:02,840  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Pepe.

1067
01:42:04,284 --> 01:42:05,433  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Thank God.

1068
01:42:08,204 --> 01:42:11,640  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
Glad to have you back.
You'll be writing in no time.

1069
01:42:13,284 --> 01:42:14,512  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Where's Lucía?

1070
01:42:19,604 --> 01:42:21,117  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
It says here that...

1071
01:42:21,484 --> 01:42:23,873  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
..your craneal hematoma
has subsided.

1072
01:42:24,484 --> 01:42:27,954  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
And the rest of your bruises
are history.

1073
01:42:29,364 --> 01:42:30,399  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Where's Lucía?

1074
01:42:34,884 --> 01:42:36,602  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
You were in bad shape.

1075
01:42:38,284 --> 01:42:40,593  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
We didn't think you'd make it.

1076
01:42:42,364 --> 01:42:43,558  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
How long have I been here?

1077
01:42:44,604 --> 01:42:45,639  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Well...

1078
01:42:47,164 --> 01:42:48,995  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
One week in a coma,

1079
01:42:49,564 --> 01:42:51,839  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
with this horrible respirator...

1080
01:42:52,284 --> 01:42:54,036  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
And two more weeks

1081
01:42:54,484 --> 01:42:57,521  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
breathing on your own,
but unconscious.

1082
01:42:58,444 --> 01:43:01,800  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
And in this room since 
four or five days ago,

1083
01:43:02,964 --> 01:43:05,239  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
blabbering in your sleep.

1084
01:43:05,684 --> 01:43:08,517  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
And when you'd wake up,
you were out of it.

1085
01:43:13,724 --> 01:43:16,158  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
We haven't heard from Lucía.

1086
01:43:16,844 --> 01:43:18,835  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
I looked everywhere.

1087
01:43:19,164 --> 01:43:22,839  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
She hasn't been to your place,
nor the restaurant, since the night

1088
01:43:23,004 --> 01:43:24,039  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
of your accident.

1089
01:43:31,964 --> 01:43:32,953  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Lorenzo.

1090
01:43:34,764 --> 01:43:37,881  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
I think Lucía
believes you're dead.

1091
01:43:38,964 --> 01:43:40,363  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
That's why she left.

1092
01:43:40,564 --> 01:43:42,202  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
I talked to the ambulance guy.

1093
01:43:42,884 --> 01:43:45,159  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
He said a cop called your house

1094
01:43:45,364 --> 01:43:46,592  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
and talked to her.

1095
01:43:46,804 --> 01:43:48,635  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
He mentioned the car...

1096
01:43:48,924 --> 01:43:49,993  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
...and she hung up.

1097
01:43:51,484 --> 01:43:52,803  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
He tried to call back

1098
01:43:53,964 --> 01:43:55,363  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
but she wouldn't answer.

1099
01:43:57,524 --> 01:43:58,843  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
I need to pee.

1100
01:43:59,924 --> 01:44:01,073  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Do it there,

1101
01:44:01,284 --> 01:44:03,115  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
-in the pan.
-No way!

1102
01:44:03,404 --> 01:44:04,519  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Wait, wait.

1103
01:44:04,964 --> 01:44:07,194  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Thanks, Pepe, but I can manage.

1104
01:44:10,404 --> 01:44:12,076  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Lose the attitude.

1105
01:44:12,364 --> 01:44:14,639  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
I've helped you all week.

1106
01:44:15,124 --> 01:44:16,637  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
You just don't remember.

1107
01:44:33,844 --> 01:44:35,197  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
I know where she might be.

1108
01:44:37,924 --> 01:44:38,959  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
You came by car?

1109
01:44:40,684 --> 01:44:42,276  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
As soon as they called.

1110
01:45:07,924 --> 01:45:08,993  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Good morning.

1111
01:45:09,964 --> 01:45:12,603  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
Tell me right now why
you're here and Belén isn't.

1112
01:45:15,564 --> 01:45:16,599  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
You see?

1113
01:45:16,804 --> 01:45:20,001  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
I don't want to forget anymore.
Thanks to you, honey.

1114
01:45:22,884 --> 01:45:23,794  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Well?

1115
01:45:24,444 --> 01:45:25,923  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Won't you answer me?

1116
01:45:27,524 --> 01:45:30,994  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
It's time to show you who
I really am, no more stories.

1117
01:45:31,244 --> 01:45:34,077  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
Were you there with Belén,
in my room,...

1118
01:45:37,444 --> 01:45:40,242  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
...when that fucking dog
killed my daughter?

1119
01:45:41,684 --> 01:45:43,402  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
-It wasn't me.
-It wasn't?

1120
01:45:43,604 --> 01:45:46,323  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
Then why are the cops
looking for you?

1121
01:45:49,924 --> 01:45:51,516  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Belén was with some guy

1122
01:45:51,724 --> 01:45:54,716  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
who met her in the park
with your daughter.

1123
01:45:55,804 --> 01:45:59,274  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
But he disappeared
after that night.

1124
01:46:09,844 --> 01:46:10,993  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
What about Belén?

1125
01:46:11,204 --> 01:46:13,274  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
Where is she?
Since you know everything.

1126
01:46:14,764 --> 01:46:17,915  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
She left with her mom
but didn't tell me where.

1127
01:46:19,244 --> 01:46:22,361  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
She changed in the end,
and chose her mom over me.

1128
01:46:27,364 --> 01:46:28,717  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Can't blame her.

1129
01:46:29,404 --> 01:46:31,872  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
A mother always comes first.

1130
01:46:35,164 --> 01:46:38,520  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
I don't trust you anymore,
Antonio...

1131
01:46:40,004 --> 01:46:42,438  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
I won't ask you
any more questions.

1132
01:46:42,644 --> 01:46:44,475  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
I'll leave that to the police.

1133
01:46:45,084 --> 01:46:46,915  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Lying to them won't be so easy.

1134
01:46:47,964 --> 01:46:50,353  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
Look how brave I got
all of a sudden.

1135
01:46:50,724 --> 01:46:51,395  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Wait.

1136
01:46:52,764 --> 01:46:55,676  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Please don't call the police.

1137
01:46:56,684 --> 01:46:57,719  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Why not?

1138
01:46:58,204 --> 01:47:00,160  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
Are you holding back
anything else?

1139
01:47:03,724 --> 01:47:05,043  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
I've no one left...

1140
01:47:05,844 --> 01:47:07,243  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
...who I can trust.

1141
01:47:08,724 --> 01:47:10,077  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Where are you going?

1142
01:47:10,524 --> 01:47:11,877  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Making a get away?

1143
01:47:12,084 --> 01:47:13,881  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
They'll track you down!

1144
01:47:15,004 --> 01:47:16,403  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
If you call the cops,

1145
01:47:17,804 --> 01:47:19,032  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
I'll leave, too.

1146
01:47:19,644 --> 01:47:20,679  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Are you stupid?

1147
01:47:21,164 --> 01:47:22,040  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Yes.

1148
01:48:19,684 --> 01:48:21,083  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Where are you going?

1149
01:48:22,124 --> 01:48:23,193  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
I don't understand.

1150
01:48:24,044 --> 01:48:27,241  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
I trust Carlos, and I believe him.
I want to know more.

1151
01:48:27,404 --> 01:48:29,076  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
That's the easy part.

1152
01:48:29,604 --> 01:48:31,242  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Believing what you want.

1153
01:48:31,524 --> 01:48:32,718  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
What pleases you.

1154
01:48:32,924 --> 01:48:34,960  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
I did that, too.
Until tonight.

1155
01:48:35,164 --> 01:48:36,961  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
I'll chase whom ever I please!

1156
01:48:37,724 --> 01:48:40,113  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Men matter less and less to me.

1157
01:48:40,364 --> 01:48:41,353  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
That's my lot.

1158
01:48:42,044 --> 01:48:43,636  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
They've never given me anything.

1159
01:48:44,044 --> 01:48:45,079  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Except sex.

1160
01:48:45,324 --> 01:48:47,963  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
No? What about the keeper?

1161
01:48:49,404 --> 01:48:50,996  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
What? Besides wild sex

1162
01:48:51,204 --> 01:48:52,239  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
and a daughter?

1163
01:48:53,844 --> 01:48:55,243  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Don't forget that story

1164
01:48:55,444 --> 01:48:58,163  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
full of advantages that
he wrote just for you!

1165
01:48:58,764 --> 01:48:59,913  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
That's right.

1166
01:49:00,684 --> 01:49:02,675  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
Maybe your boyfriend
was the last

1167
01:49:02,844 --> 01:49:04,641  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
-good man on earth.
-No, he wasn't.

1168
01:49:06,004 --> 01:49:09,121  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
You're wrong,
but that's my business.

1169
01:49:09,604 --> 01:49:12,402  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
And I suppose Carlos
is also your business.

1170
01:49:12,844 --> 01:49:14,038  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Yours alone.

1171
01:49:14,524 --> 01:49:16,515  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
You're the only one chasing him.

1172
01:49:17,964 --> 01:49:18,840  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Yeah.

1173
01:49:19,724 --> 01:49:21,203  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Come to think of it,

1174
01:49:21,404 --> 01:49:23,964  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
I always chase men.
When I like them.

1175
01:49:24,444 --> 01:49:26,082  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
To each his own, right?

1176
01:49:30,364 --> 01:49:31,877  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Where could he be?

1177
01:49:33,084 --> 01:49:35,678  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
I don't know. I'm going home.

1178
01:49:35,884 --> 01:49:37,602  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
You guys cook tonight.

1179
01:52:46,644 --> 01:52:48,202  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
I'm so sorry.

1180
01:54:04,004 --> 01:54:05,642  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Carlos! It's me, Lucía.

1181
01:54:05,844 --> 01:54:07,800  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
I want to come down.

1182
01:54:09,364 --> 01:54:10,763  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Come and help me.

1183
01:54:11,724 --> 01:54:14,284  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
I know how to dive, too.
What did you think?

1184
01:54:20,044 --> 01:54:22,000  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Lucía. It's me, Elena.

1185
01:54:33,204 --> 01:54:34,273  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Where's Carlos?

1186
01:54:34,684 --> 01:54:35,912  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Down there.

1187
01:54:36,284 --> 01:54:37,512  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Did he escape?

1188
01:54:39,724 --> 01:54:40,759  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Maybe he's dead.

1189
01:54:45,004 --> 01:54:48,394  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
If he turns up,
we have to believe him, okay?

1190
01:54:49,404 --> 01:54:50,757  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Whatever you want.

1191
01:54:51,404 --> 01:54:52,473  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
That's right.

1192
01:54:53,684 --> 01:54:54,878  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
He's a crab.

1193
01:54:58,324 --> 01:54:59,393  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Let's go home.

1194
01:54:59,644 --> 01:55:00,599  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
What for?

1195
01:55:00,844 --> 01:55:01,833  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
To eat.

1196
01:55:02,084 --> 01:55:02,800  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
So early?

1197
01:55:04,484 --> 01:55:05,519  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
I'm not hungry.

1198
01:55:05,924 --> 01:55:08,518  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
Tough. It's about time
you helped me cook.

1199
01:55:10,124 --> 01:55:13,355  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
We'll make a special meal
and we'll be together

1200
01:55:14,204 --> 01:55:15,432  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
and have fun.

1201
01:55:32,004 --> 01:55:34,040  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
You're a gift to this earth.

1202
01:55:35,284 --> 01:55:38,321  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Elena. You're crying.

1203
01:55:41,724 --> 01:55:44,841  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
Tears of happiness,
which is what I am from now on.

1204
01:55:45,044 --> 01:55:47,000  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
Great. I hope it's contagious.

1205
01:55:47,204 --> 01:55:48,796  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
Piece of cake.
Let's go.

1206
01:58:50,204 --> 01:58:53,560  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
The first advantage
ls at the end of the story.

1207
01:58:53,764 --> 01:58:54,719  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
It doesn't finish,

1208
01:58:54,924 --> 01:58:56,755  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
It falls ln a hole.

1209
01:59:00,924 --> 01:59:03,199  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
And the story
starts again halfway.

1210
01:59:04,724 --> 01:59:07,602  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
The other advantage,
and the biggest,

1211
01:59:08,244 --> 01:59:11,316  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
Is that you can change course
along the way...

1212
01:59:11,484 --> 01:59:14,396  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:450 Y2:517
If you let me.
If you give me time.

1213
01:59:57,244 --> 01:59:58,438  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:484 Y2:517
A ray of sunshine...
