01:36:05,320 --> 01:36:07,188
And this is the confessional, father.

1447
01:36:07,389 --> 01:36:08,856
We're not talking gossip here.

1448
01:36:08,857 --> 01:36:10,358
- I'm still an oak.

1449
01:36:10,399 --> 01:36:12,393
I thought you were
a what-do-you-call-it...

1450
01:36:12,454 --> 01:36:13,094
- An ash.

1451
01:36:13,145 --> 01:36:14,529
An ash.

1452
01:36:14,930 --> 01:36:18,803
Well, her solicitor said
she'll get deported

1453
01:36:18,834 --> 01:36:20,935
if she doesn't become a national.

1454
01:36:21,136 --> 01:36:24,806
So, she has to apply
to the Department of Justice.

1455
01:36:25,307 --> 01:36:30,338
Or... She... Gets... Married.

1456
01:36:31,379 --> 01:36:32,981
Ah.

1457
01:36:33,782 --> 01:36:38,386
So, who's going to marry her, Syracuse?

1458
01:36:38,787 --> 01:36:42,590
Well, it's not like
there's a queue, father.

1459
01:36:42,691 --> 01:36:44,118
- Well, I can't marry her.

1460
01:36:44,159 --> 01:36:46,260
No, no. You're a tree.

1461
01:36:46,311 --> 01:36:47,362
- Exactly.

1462
01:37:12,855 --> 01:37:15,356
Annie: And I threw
the selkie coat in the water.

1463
01:37:15,457 --> 01:37:17,609
And I told a lie about that, too.

1464
01:37:17,860 --> 01:37:19,653
Wasn't a real lie, was it?

1465
01:37:19,694 --> 01:37:21,913
Because I wanted her to stay forever.

1466
01:37:21,964 --> 01:37:23,551
Priest:
She's staying forever?

1467
01:37:23,632 --> 01:37:25,659
Yeah. Haven't you heard?

1468
01:37:25,700 --> 01:37:28,570
They're getting married next week
to make her a national.

1469
01:37:29,071 --> 01:37:32,997
So I suppose
she isn't a selkie really.

1470
01:37:33,508 --> 01:37:35,843
Because you can't marry a seal, can you?

1471
01:37:35,894 --> 01:37:38,696
No. You definitely cannot.

1472
01:37:39,147 --> 01:37:41,616
Not in the real quotidian world, anyway.

1473
01:37:41,817 --> 01:37:43,017
Quotidian?

1474
01:37:43,058 --> 01:37:47,089
Yeah. Means the one we have to live in.

1475
01:37:48,090 --> 01:37:50,591
If she was a seal, though,
would you still do the wedding?

1476
01:37:50,632 --> 01:37:51,833
Me?

1477
01:37:53,728 --> 01:37:56,598
Annie:
What about your past lives?

1478
01:37:56,799 --> 01:37:58,309
Joanna:
Are you sure I have them?

1479
01:37:58,400 --> 01:38:00,885
Oh, yeah, everybody does.

1480
01:38:00,936 --> 01:38:02,971
It's just a matter of remembering.

1481
01:38:03,272 --> 01:38:04,838
Stop peeping, would you?

1482
01:38:04,879 --> 01:38:05,840
I don't peep.

1483
01:38:06,141 --> 01:38:09,504
I mean, you could have even been
married in one of them.

1484
01:38:09,945 --> 01:38:13,815
♫ and we could
 keep each other warm ♫ 

1485
