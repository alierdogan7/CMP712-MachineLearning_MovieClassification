1
00:01:22,629 --> 00:01:24,290
Thorny.

2
00:01:32,439 --> 00:01:34,805
You call this a report card?

3
00:01:34,841 --> 00:01:37,605
What kind of marks is these?

4
00:01:37,644 --> 00:01:40,613
How you gonna go to college
with marks like these?

5
00:01:40,647 --> 00:01:41,909
I don't want to go to college.

6
00:01:41,948 --> 00:01:43,609
I want to work
in the shop with you.

7
00:01:43,650 --> 00:01:45,413
You want to work
in the shop with me, huh?

8
00:01:45,452 --> 00:01:47,317
Listen to me.

9
00:01:47,354 --> 00:01:50,118
I said it once,
and I'll say it again...

10
00:01:50,157 --> 00:01:52,955
I don't care how rich
or successful a man is...

11
00:01:52,993 --> 00:01:55,894
if he don't got an education,
he's got nothing.

12
00:01:55,929 --> 00:01:58,898
- I tried, Pop. I can't do it.
- Then try harder!

13
00:02:04,171 --> 00:02:07,732
You can do anything in life
you want to do.

14
00:02:07,774 --> 00:02:11,938
Remember... you're a Meloni.

15
00:04:22,275 --> 00:04:24,243
Hi there.
Are you a large person?

16
00:04:24,277 --> 00:04:26,905
Pleasantly plump? A little
on the hefty side, perhaps?

17
00:04:26,947 --> 00:04:29,279
Well, let's face it.
Are you fat?

18
00:04:29,316 --> 00:04:31,284
When you go jogging,
do you leave potholes?

19
00:04:31,318 --> 00:04:33,513
When you make love,
do you have to give directions?

20
00:04:33,553 --> 00:04:35,817
At the zoo, do elephants
throw you peanuts?

21
00:04:35,855 --> 00:04:37,880
Do you look at a menu
and say, "OK"?

22
00:04:37,924 --> 00:04:39,721
Well, now you can
eat all you want...

23
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:41,693
because at Thornton Melon's
Tall and Fat stores...

24
00:04:41,728 --> 00:04:42,956
we've got you covered.

25
00:04:42,996 --> 00:04:45,556
That's right... fine woolen
and woolen blend suits...

26
00:04:45,599 --> 00:04:47,726
and sport coats
in all the larger sizes...

27
00:04:47,767 --> 00:04:51,464
husky, stout, extra-stout
and the new Hindenburg line.

28
00:04:51,504 --> 00:04:54,064
And for you ladies,
we have caftans, muumuus...

29
00:04:54,107 --> 00:04:57,099
and our own exclusive A-frame
in all colors and patterns.

30
00:04:57,143 --> 00:04:59,703
Yes, we have
miles and miles of fabric.

31
00:04:59,746 --> 00:05:01,714
So take it from me,
Thornton Melon...

32
00:05:01,748 --> 00:05:05,240
if you want to look thin,
you hang out with fat people.

33
00:05:05,285 --> 00:05:09,016
Thornton Melon's Tall and Fat...
150 locations across America.

34
00:05:09,055 --> 00:05:11,580
Lou, did you see the new spot?

35
00:05:11,625 --> 00:05:12,751
Yeah, I seen it.

36
00:05:12,792 --> 00:05:14,089
Do I look fat in it?

37
00:05:14,127 --> 00:05:15,788
You could lose
a couple of pounds.

38
00:05:15,829 --> 00:05:19,128
I gotta get bigger actors.

39
00:05:21,701 --> 00:05:25,034
Pocahontas, how are you?
Ophelia, hold some of my calls.

40
00:05:25,071 --> 00:05:27,471
Yes, sir, Mr. Melon.

41
00:05:30,477 --> 00:05:31,444
Good morning, everyone.

42
00:05:31,478 --> 00:05:33,605
Morning.

43
00:05:33,647 --> 00:05:35,308
Take it easy, will ya?

44
00:05:35,348 --> 00:05:38,840
And don't get any on the walls.

45
00:05:38,885 --> 00:05:41,046
OK, folks. What's up?

46
00:05:41,087 --> 00:05:43,146
Mr. Melon,
we have a serious offer...

47
00:05:43,189 --> 00:05:46,158
on your commercial property
in south Florida...

48
00:05:46,192 --> 00:05:48,183
and we feel you should sell.

49
00:05:48,228 --> 00:05:50,992
No. Hold it for one more year,
take the depreciation...

50
00:05:51,031 --> 00:05:53,591
then transfer title
to the California Corporation.

51
00:05:53,633 --> 00:05:55,828
Show it as a capital gain.
We should do great.

52
00:05:58,672 --> 00:05:59,866
What else?

53
00:05:59,906 --> 00:06:02,170
The toy division has come up
with a new doll idea...

54
00:06:02,208 --> 00:06:04,836
to go along with our
children's clothing line.

55
00:06:04,878 --> 00:06:07,676
We call them Melon Patch Kids.

56
00:06:07,714 --> 00:06:10,012
Now, the competition
exploits the notion...

57
00:06:10,050 --> 00:06:12,780
that their dolls are orphans.

58
00:06:12,819 --> 00:06:16,050
The Melon Patch Kids
are not orphans.

59
00:06:16,089 --> 00:06:18,250
They're abandoned.

60
00:06:18,291 --> 00:06:19,758
We think it's a winner.

61
00:06:19,793 --> 00:06:21,090
OK, go with it.

62
00:06:21,127 --> 00:06:23,493
But keep the unit cost
under five bucks.

63
00:06:23,530 --> 00:06:26,693
Last year, we took a bath
on those Chubby Tubby Tub toys.

64
00:06:26,733 --> 00:06:29,167
- Jason's on the phone.
- Jason.

65
00:06:29,202 --> 00:06:31,727
OK, everybody, take a break.

66
00:06:31,771 --> 00:06:35,901
Excuse me, Mr. Melon,
but we have a very long agenda.

67
00:06:35,942 --> 00:06:39,070
- Later. My son's on the phone.
- But, Mr. Melon!

68
00:06:39,112 --> 00:06:41,103
Beat it, punk.

69
00:06:43,950 --> 00:06:45,110
Jason, how are you?

70
00:06:45,151 --> 00:06:47,085
How you doin'?
How's the diving going?

71
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:49,884
Oh, it's great.
We just finished up practice.

72
00:06:49,923 --> 00:06:52,118
Oh, keep it up, keep it up!
And the fraternity...

73
00:06:52,158 --> 00:06:54,126
I'll bet you're having fun
in the fraternity, huh?

74
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:57,220
What do you think?
Yeah, it's great.

75
00:06:57,263 --> 00:06:58,855
Oh, that's great.

76
00:06:58,898 --> 00:07:01,458
You're not doing too much,
are you? You studying?

77
00:07:01,501 --> 00:07:03,765
Well, right now,
we're between semesters...

78
00:07:03,803 --> 00:07:05,771
so classes don't start up
again for another week.

79
00:07:05,805 --> 00:07:08,069
No classes? Then come home.

80
00:07:08,108 --> 00:07:09,871
Tonight, your mother and I
are having a big party.

81
00:07:09,909 --> 00:07:11,274
It's our fifth anniversary.

82
00:07:11,311 --> 00:07:15,577
Whoa, Dad. She's not my mother,
she's your wife...

83
00:07:15,615 --> 00:07:17,776
and I don't get the feeling
she wants me around.

84
00:07:17,817 --> 00:07:20,308
OK, let's not start that again.

85
00:07:20,353 --> 00:07:22,651
I'll tell you what.
I'll come up there to see you.

86
00:07:22,689 --> 00:07:24,657
No. Bad. Bad idea.

87
00:07:24,691 --> 00:07:26,682
I got this big dive meet
coming up.

88
00:07:26,726 --> 00:07:29,058
I gotta practice. I wouldn't
have any time to see you.

89
00:07:29,095 --> 00:07:32,121
- It's a rotten time.
- OK. I understand.

90
00:07:32,165 --> 00:07:33,325
Look, Dad, I promise...

91
00:07:33,366 --> 00:07:35,630
I'll come down for a visit
next break I get, OK?

92
00:07:35,668 --> 00:07:38,569
All right?
Look, I gotta go, OK?

93
00:07:38,605 --> 00:07:39,731
OK, Jason.

94
00:07:39,773 --> 00:07:41,798
Take care of yourself.
I love you.

95
00:07:41,841 --> 00:07:44,867
Yeah, I love you, too.
All right. Bye-bye.

96
00:07:44,911 --> 00:07:46,879
Melon, I told you
to clean my locker.

97
00:07:46,913 --> 00:07:48,505
If it's too much for you...

98
00:07:48,548 --> 00:07:50,379
we'll get ourselves
a new towel boy.

99
00:07:50,416 --> 00:07:54,477
Right. Look, I'm sorry, Chas.
I'll get on it as soon as I can.

100
00:08:11,404 --> 00:08:12,632
Home sweet home.

101
00:08:12,672 --> 00:08:15,470
- I liked the old house better.
- So did I.

102
00:08:15,508 --> 00:08:17,135
I liked the old wife
better, too.

103
00:08:17,177 --> 00:08:20,112
Lay off Vanessa.
She gives great headache.

104
00:08:20,146 --> 00:08:22,273
Lou, I can't believe it.
Married five years.

105
00:08:22,315 --> 00:08:24,215
Seems like yesterday.

106
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:26,775
And you know what a lousy day
yesterday was.

107
00:08:31,558 --> 00:08:34,391
Please don't throw your clothes
on the Breuer chair.

108
00:08:34,427 --> 00:08:37,362
How come all our furniture
has names?

109
00:08:37,397 --> 00:08:39,865
I have absolutely
nothing to wear.

110
00:08:39,899 --> 00:08:42,060
You got six closets
full of nothing to wear.

111
00:08:42,101 --> 00:08:44,968
Are you saying
I spend too much money?

112
00:08:45,004 --> 00:08:46,869
You, spend too much money? No.

113
00:08:46,906 --> 00:08:50,637
Lots of people go to Switzerland
to get their watch fixed.

114
00:08:50,677 --> 00:08:53,407
You have no taste, Thornton.

115
00:08:53,446 --> 00:08:55,505
You're right.
I married you, didn't I?

116
00:08:55,548 --> 00:08:56,845
I don't have time to argue.

117
00:08:56,883 --> 00:08:58,350
Our friends will be here
any minute.

118
00:08:58,384 --> 00:08:59,715
You mean your friends.

119
00:08:59,752 --> 00:09:02,619
They are my friends,
and I'd like to keep them.

120
00:09:02,655 --> 00:09:04,555
So please,
just behave yourself tonight.

121
00:09:04,591 --> 00:09:07,492
Don't worry. If the roast beef
is right, they'll be back.

122
00:09:12,866 --> 00:09:15,130
Jennifer, you look divine.

123
00:09:15,168 --> 00:09:18,001
And, Peter, I thought
you were still in Portofino.

124
00:09:18,037 --> 00:09:20,904
Why haven't you called?

125
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:23,534
- She's a lovely gal.
- Oh, yes, she is.

126
00:09:23,576 --> 00:09:26,204
Oh, Ramon,
you look fantastic.

127
00:09:26,246 --> 00:09:28,544
I thought you were still
in Tijuana.

128
00:09:28,581 --> 00:09:31,641
- Excuse me, señor?
- Nothing. It's all right.

129
00:09:31,684 --> 00:09:34,209
- Gimme a beer.
- I'm sorry, señor.

130
00:09:34,254 --> 00:09:37,087
All we have is martinis
and champagne.

131
00:09:37,123 --> 00:09:39,353
My own house,
I can't get a beer.

132
00:09:39,392 --> 00:09:42,884
Mrs. Melon gave us
strict orders... no cerveza.

133
00:09:42,929 --> 00:09:45,295
It's all right.
I'll get it myself.

134
00:10:02,181 --> 00:10:03,648
Hey! Adam and evil.

135
00:10:06,286 --> 00:10:08,151
Mr. Melon.

136
00:10:08,187 --> 00:10:10,087
We was just...

137
00:10:10,123 --> 00:10:13,115
Iooking for some
cocktail napkins.

138
00:10:13,159 --> 00:10:14,956
Where? Under her dress?

139
00:10:14,994 --> 00:10:16,791
You're impossible.

140
00:10:16,829 --> 00:10:18,160
And you're easy.

141
00:10:22,302 --> 00:10:24,702
I love Klimt, don't you?

142
00:10:24,737 --> 00:10:27,900
Mr. Melon, your wife
was just showing us her Klimt.

143
00:10:27,941 --> 00:10:30,842
You too, huh? She's showin' it
to everybody.

144
00:10:30,877 --> 00:10:33,107
- She's very proud of it.
- I'm proud of mine, too.

145
00:10:33,146 --> 00:10:35,239
I don't wave it around
at parties.

146
00:10:35,281 --> 00:10:37,772
- It's an exceptional painting.
- Oh, the painting.

147
00:10:37,817 --> 00:10:40,479
Yeah. Drink up,
enjoy yourself, huh?

148
00:10:45,959 --> 00:10:48,189
I hate small food, you know?

149
00:11:12,452 --> 00:11:14,420
Hey, buddy,
come here, will you?

150
00:11:14,454 --> 00:11:16,388
Put your hand
right over there, will you?

151
00:11:16,422 --> 00:11:18,413
I learned this in Europe.

152
00:11:24,797 --> 00:11:27,357
Look out, coming through.
Hot stuff. Look out.

153
00:11:29,969 --> 00:11:31,937
I'd like you to meet
Mr. And Mrs. Stuyvesant.

154
00:11:31,971 --> 00:11:33,063
Right, right.

155
00:11:33,106 --> 00:11:34,630
- How do you do?
- Thornton!

156
00:11:37,443 --> 00:11:39,741
How you doin'?

157
00:11:42,081 --> 00:11:44,072
Hi there, sir. How are you?

158
00:11:46,552 --> 00:11:49,112
Never mind. I got my own here.
It's all right.

159
00:11:51,591 --> 00:11:54,583
Millicent, you look charming.
I love your dress.

160
00:11:54,627 --> 00:11:56,492
Don't you, Thornton?

161
00:11:56,529 --> 00:11:58,497
It's such a lovely shade
of green.

162
00:11:58,531 --> 00:12:01,898
Yeah. If that dress had pockets,
you'd look like a pool table.

163
00:12:01,934 --> 00:12:03,925
You should try
my Tall and Fat stores.

164
00:12:03,970 --> 00:12:05,198
No offense.

165
00:12:08,241 --> 00:12:11,233
May I speak to you
privately, please?

166
00:12:15,581 --> 00:12:17,572
Watch my sandwich, will you?

167
00:12:19,118 --> 00:12:21,245
I can't take any more of this!

168
00:12:21,287 --> 00:12:24,085
You've insulted our friends,
you've insulted me...

169
00:12:24,123 --> 00:12:26,353
and you've gone out of your way
to ruin this party.

170
00:12:26,392 --> 00:12:28,724
Party? Are you kiddin'?
It's a dog show out there.

171
00:12:28,761 --> 00:12:31,355
Your friends, they come here
for free food, free booze...

172
00:12:31,397 --> 00:12:33,490
and to suck up to you
for donations.

173
00:12:33,533 --> 00:12:36,525
You have no class, Thornton,
and I am tired of it.

174
00:12:36,569 --> 00:12:38,036
I want a divorce.

175
00:12:38,071 --> 00:12:40,631
Divorce. I knew
we had something in common.

176
00:12:40,673 --> 00:12:42,163
Here, sign these.

177
00:12:44,710 --> 00:12:47,770
I'm afraid it's not gonna be
that easy, honey.

178
00:12:47,814 --> 00:12:50,476
This is gonna cost you...
plenty!

179
00:12:50,516 --> 00:12:52,711
Oh, yeah?

180
00:12:52,752 --> 00:12:55,277
Let's talk about class
a minute, all right?

181
00:12:55,321 --> 00:12:57,289
Here's you and Giorgio
in the guest room.

182
00:12:57,323 --> 00:12:58,984
Classy, isn't it?

183
00:12:59,025 --> 00:13:00,856
Here's you and Giorgio
in the rumpus room.

184
00:13:00,893 --> 00:13:02,622
Another classy one, huh?

185
00:13:02,662 --> 00:13:05,529
This one I can't figure out.
There's you, there's Giorgio...

186
00:13:05,565 --> 00:13:07,658
what's with the midget
over here?

187
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:10,100
Hey, wait! I got more!

188
00:13:22,482 --> 00:13:23,642
What happened in there?

189
00:13:23,683 --> 00:13:25,344
What happened?

190
00:13:25,384 --> 00:13:29,081
I got rid of Vanessa.
I feel like I just got paroled.

191
00:13:29,122 --> 00:13:31,317
I'll tell you what bothers me...

192
00:13:31,357 --> 00:13:33,689
I let her come
between me and Jason.

193
00:13:33,726 --> 00:13:36,820
Lou, pack our bags.

194
00:13:42,101 --> 00:13:44,535
We're going up to that college
to see my son!

195
00:14:21,674 --> 00:14:24,302
Boy, will Jason be surprised.

196
00:14:24,343 --> 00:14:27,312
Look, there's Greek letters.
That must be the house.

197
00:14:47,133 --> 00:14:49,067
Is that an "amigo"
or a unicorn?

198
00:14:49,101 --> 00:14:51,194
Beats me.
Don't you know any Greek?

199
00:14:51,237 --> 00:14:53,330
The only Greek I know owns
a coffee shop on State Street.

200
00:14:53,372 --> 00:14:55,897
Jimmy Pitsos, remember him?
He had an ugly wife...

201
00:14:55,942 --> 00:14:58,775
four ugly kids,
and good coffee.

202
00:14:58,811 --> 00:15:01,245
Wait here, I'll try this one.

203
00:15:13,559 --> 00:15:15,652
Hello, hello!

204
00:15:18,731 --> 00:15:21,222
Anybody here?

205
00:15:21,267 --> 00:15:24,100
Jason, where are you?

206
00:15:24,136 --> 00:15:26,866
Hey, I need some help here!

207
00:15:26,906 --> 00:15:30,137
Buddy, I'm talking to you.
I need some help here!

208
00:15:30,176 --> 00:15:33,202
Take it easy, honey!
I didn't see a thing.

209
00:15:33,246 --> 00:15:34,941
You're perfect.

210
00:15:34,981 --> 00:15:37,176
You jerk!

211
00:15:37,216 --> 00:15:39,343
Perfectly understandable,
Mr. Melon.

212
00:15:39,385 --> 00:15:41,979
It was an honest mistake.
Let's just call it a bad day.

213
00:15:42,021 --> 00:15:44,785
Yeah, but a great view.
You're all right, officer.

214
00:15:44,824 --> 00:15:46,348
Here, a little something
for the kids.

215
00:15:46,392 --> 00:15:48,622
- Take that, it's OK.
- I don't have any kids.

216
00:15:48,661 --> 00:15:50,629
No kids? Well, here,
get yourself some kids.

217
00:15:50,663 --> 00:15:52,893
Take it all, all right?
And just remember...

218
00:15:52,932 --> 00:15:55,457
the best thing about kids
is making 'em.

219
00:15:57,270 --> 00:15:59,465
Even if I do manage
to graduate... ha ha...

220
00:15:59,505 --> 00:16:01,905
what do I do then?
There's the private sector...

221
00:16:01,941 --> 00:16:04,034
but look how bad
the job market is.

222
00:16:04,076 --> 00:16:05,475
There's Valerie Desmond.

223
00:16:05,511 --> 00:16:07,274
See you guys.

224
00:16:10,383 --> 00:16:13,079
Look how tight
her ass is today.

225
00:16:13,119 --> 00:16:15,815
Oh, man. You think
there's any way...

226
00:16:15,855 --> 00:16:18,983
she would ever go out with me?

227
00:16:19,025 --> 00:16:21,323
- No.
- Oh, thanks.

228
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:23,521
It's this whole stupid
capitalist system, you know?

229
00:16:23,562 --> 00:16:25,325
It's set up to heap rewards...

230
00:16:25,364 --> 00:16:26,956
on the advantaged
and the aggressive...

231
00:16:26,999 --> 00:16:29,024
and to make sure
that two regular schmoes...

232
00:16:29,068 --> 00:16:32,936
like you and me never get a date
with girls like Valerie Desmond.

233
00:16:32,972 --> 00:16:35,907
I hate the whole bourgeois
mentality of this school.

234
00:16:35,941 --> 00:16:37,909
Let me ask you
something else, man.

235
00:16:37,943 --> 00:16:40,173
Do you make this bullshit up
as you go along...

236
00:16:40,212 --> 00:16:42,703
- or do you actually read this?
- I read this. It's Karl Marx.

237
00:16:42,748 --> 00:16:45,114
Famous book.
"Proletarian Chicks in Bondage."

238
00:16:45,151 --> 00:16:47,619
It's a Condom House book.
Comes with a leather hood.

239
00:16:47,653 --> 00:16:49,314
Is that the one
with the pictures?

240
00:16:49,355 --> 00:16:50,652
- Can I borrow that?
- Let's move on.

241
00:16:50,690 --> 00:16:53,454
Well, no, it's, you know...

242
00:16:53,492 --> 00:16:55,687
Oh, yeah. Well, you know.

243
00:16:57,763 --> 00:17:00,994
Dad, what are you doin' here?

244
00:17:01,033 --> 00:17:03,433
I'm robbin' your room,
that's what I'm doin' here.

245
00:17:03,469 --> 00:17:05,232
We drive 300 miles
to see the kid...

246
00:17:05,271 --> 00:17:08,331
that's the greeting we get.
Come here, will ya?

247
00:17:09,742 --> 00:17:11,642
How ya doin' there?

248
00:17:11,677 --> 00:17:13,941
I'm sorry.
I'm really glad to see you...

249
00:17:13,979 --> 00:17:15,742
but I wish
I knew you were coming.

250
00:17:15,781 --> 00:17:17,112
I'll bet you did, huh?

251
00:17:17,149 --> 00:17:18,810
I looked for you
at that fraternity house.

252
00:17:18,851 --> 00:17:21,183
- They said you weren't a member.
- I can explain that.

253
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:22,551
They also told me
you're not on the diving team.

254
00:17:22,588 --> 00:17:24,647
They said you were
the towel boy.

255
00:17:24,690 --> 00:17:27,022
- I can explain that, too.
- OK, explain it.

256
00:17:27,059 --> 00:17:29,892
- I lied.
- Great. That explains it, huh?

257
00:17:29,929 --> 00:17:33,057
Jason, you don't lie to me.
You lie to girls.

258
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:35,592
Who's this?

259
00:17:35,634 --> 00:17:37,761
Oh, I'm sorry.
This is my roommate.

260
00:17:37,803 --> 00:17:38,770
That's Derek Lutz.

261
00:17:38,804 --> 00:17:41,534
This is the dad,
and that's Lou.

262
00:17:41,574 --> 00:17:44,065
- Is that your real hair?
- What do you think?

263
00:17:44,110 --> 00:17:47,238
I think you're trying
to get back at your parents.

264
00:17:47,279 --> 00:17:49,406
Show me the campus.
I want to talk to you.

265
00:17:49,448 --> 00:17:50,608
Oh, good.

266
00:17:58,357 --> 00:18:00,382
Boy, what a great-lookin' place.

267
00:18:00,426 --> 00:18:02,189
When I used to dream
about going to college...

268
00:18:02,228 --> 00:18:03,855
this is the way
I always pictured it.

269
00:18:03,896 --> 00:18:05,989
Wait a minute. When did you
dream about going to college?

270
00:18:06,031 --> 00:18:09,296
When I used to fall asleep
in high school.

271
00:18:09,335 --> 00:18:11,269
Dad, I know how much
all this means to you...

272
00:18:11,303 --> 00:18:14,670
- and I'm sorry I lied to you.
- You don't have to lie to me.

273
00:18:14,707 --> 00:18:17,198
No matter what you do,
I'll love you just the same.

274
00:18:17,243 --> 00:18:18,642
Will you love me
no matter what?

275
00:18:18,677 --> 00:18:19,871
No matter what.

276
00:18:19,912 --> 00:18:22,608
- I'm droppin' out.
- You're droppin' out?

277
00:18:22,648 --> 00:18:25,242
You just got here.
You just started.

278
00:18:25,284 --> 00:18:27,252
I know,
but I'm not making it here.

279
00:18:27,286 --> 00:18:29,481
I don't fit in, you know?
I got one friend... Derek.

280
00:18:29,522 --> 00:18:31,547
He's got no friends.

281
00:18:31,590 --> 00:18:34,115
The girls don't like me,
the fraternities don't want me.

282
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:35,718
The diving coach
won't even talk to me.

283
00:18:35,761 --> 00:18:37,786
Look at it this way...

284
00:18:37,830 --> 00:18:39,798
at least you're getting
an education.

285
00:18:39,832 --> 00:18:42,392
Dad, last semester
I got nothing but "Cs."

286
00:18:42,435 --> 00:18:44,232
A, B, C...
you're in the top three.

287
00:18:44,270 --> 00:18:45,862
What are you worrying about?

288
00:18:45,905 --> 00:18:47,736
I just think I'd be
a lot better off...

289
00:18:47,773 --> 00:18:49,331
gettin' a job or something.

290
00:18:49,375 --> 00:18:51,707
You never went to college.
Look how great you're doin'.

291
00:18:51,744 --> 00:18:54,338
Jason, I said it before
and I'll say it again.

292
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:56,610
I don't care how rich
and successful a man is.

293
00:18:56,649 --> 00:18:58,241
Without an education,
he's nothing.

294
00:18:58,284 --> 00:19:00,616
I mean, stay in school.
Study harder.

295
00:19:00,653 --> 00:19:02,518
You can be whatever
you want to be.

296
00:19:02,555 --> 00:19:04,022
You want to be a loser,
be a loser.

297
00:19:04,056 --> 00:19:05,148
You want to be a winner,
be a winner.

298
00:19:05,191 --> 00:19:07,421
Jason, it's up to you.
You can do it.

299
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:10,361
Remember, you're a Melon!

300
00:19:10,396 --> 00:19:14,526
Dad, that's easy for you to say.
You don't have to do any of it.

301
00:19:16,936 --> 00:19:19,268
OK, then.
I'll do it with you.

302
00:19:20,606 --> 00:19:22,096
What do you mean,
you'll do it with me?

303
00:19:22,141 --> 00:19:24,507
I mean just what I said.

304
00:19:24,543 --> 00:19:26,511
I'm going to college.
What do you think?

305
00:19:26,545 --> 00:19:29,013
What do I think?
I think you're nuts.

306
00:19:29,048 --> 00:19:32,848
Nuts, huh? Who made the rules?
Come here. I'm going to college!

307
00:19:32,885 --> 00:19:34,409
I'm going to college!

308
00:19:37,323 --> 00:19:39,917
Let me get this straight,
Mr. Melon.

309
00:19:39,959 --> 00:19:43,486
You wish to enter
this widely esteemed...

310
00:19:43,529 --> 00:19:45,963
Grand Lakes University of ours
as a freshman?

311
00:19:45,998 --> 00:19:47,795
That's right, Dean Martin.

312
00:19:48,934 --> 00:19:52,461
- Are you comfortable?
- I'm fine, yeah.

313
00:19:52,505 --> 00:19:54,564
Oh, the chair. I'm sorry.

314
00:19:57,643 --> 00:20:00,476
This is an awkward moment
for me, Mr. Melon...

315
00:20:00,513 --> 00:20:02,879
since I realize you're
a highly respected member...

316
00:20:02,915 --> 00:20:04,405
of our business community.

317
00:20:04,450 --> 00:20:07,283
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

318
00:20:07,319 --> 00:20:10,880
Our student body here
is handpicked by me...

319
00:20:10,923 --> 00:20:12,390
from the crème de la crème...

320
00:20:12,424 --> 00:20:15,552
of students all across
this great land of ours.

321
00:20:15,594 --> 00:20:17,619
That's one of the things
I like about this place.

322
00:20:17,663 --> 00:20:19,688
Yes. The point is, though...

323
00:20:19,732 --> 00:20:21,700
since you have
no high school diploma...

324
00:20:21,734 --> 00:20:25,170
and no transcripts of any kind,
no S.A.T. Scores...

325
00:20:25,204 --> 00:20:28,901
and you're 30 to 40 years older
than our average freshman...

326
00:20:28,941 --> 00:20:31,671
how can this university
ever see its way clear...

327
00:20:31,710 --> 00:20:34,110
to accept you as a student?

328
00:20:34,146 --> 00:20:36,706
As Calvin Coolidge once said...

329
00:20:36,749 --> 00:20:39,775
"The business of America
is business"...

330
00:20:39,818 --> 00:20:42,343
and the business of
an educational institution...

331
00:20:42,388 --> 00:20:45,016
such as ours
is to create young minds...

332
00:20:45,057 --> 00:20:46,957
that understand that
the business of America...

333
00:20:46,992 --> 00:20:50,689
is the kind of business
that it actually is.

334
00:20:50,729 --> 00:20:54,722
So, whatever it is that
I have said here today...

335
00:20:54,767 --> 00:20:59,397
the point is
that we are here to honor...

336
00:20:59,438 --> 00:21:02,532
our most generous benefactor...

337
00:21:02,575 --> 00:21:05,305
and newest freshman...

338
00:21:05,344 --> 00:21:07,107
the man who's
made it possible...

339
00:21:07,146 --> 00:21:10,047
for us to break ground
here today...

340
00:21:10,082 --> 00:21:12,380
Mr. Thornton Melon.

341
00:21:15,521 --> 00:21:17,887
Dean Martin, great speech.

342
00:21:17,923 --> 00:21:20,289
There's nothing like good,
clean business, huh?

343
00:21:20,326 --> 00:21:23,386
And a little monkey business.

344
00:21:23,429 --> 00:21:26,660
Oh, Philip. I'm so glad
you could make it.

345
00:21:26,699 --> 00:21:29,099
Mr. Melon, I'd like for you
to meet Dr. Philip Barbay...

346
00:21:29,134 --> 00:21:33,195
who's the dean
of our school of business.

347
00:21:33,238 --> 00:21:35,001
David, I just want
to get it on record...

348
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:36,632
that I am totally against this.

349
00:21:36,675 --> 00:21:38,802
I don't think
that selling admission...

350
00:21:38,844 --> 00:21:40,903
to an obviously
unqualified student...

351
00:21:40,946 --> 00:21:43,437
is very ethical or honorable.

352
00:21:43,482 --> 00:21:47,009
Right, Phil,
but I'd just like to say...

353
00:21:47,052 --> 00:21:49,350
in all fairness
to Mr. Melon here...

354
00:21:49,388 --> 00:21:52,357
it was a really big check.

355
00:21:52,391 --> 00:21:54,484
It's a simple matter
of this man's presence...

356
00:21:54,526 --> 00:21:57,495
undermining the efforts
of our legitimate students...

357
00:21:57,529 --> 00:21:59,497
who are here as a result
of hard work.

358
00:21:59,531 --> 00:22:00,828
Hard work?

359
00:22:00,866 --> 00:22:03,562
Listen, Sherlock, while you were
tucked away up here...

360
00:22:03,602 --> 00:22:05,570
working on your ethics,
I was out there...

361
00:22:05,604 --> 00:22:07,629
busting my hump
in the real world.

362
00:22:07,673 --> 00:22:09,868
And the reason guys like you
got a place to teach...

363
00:22:09,908 --> 00:22:12,001
is 'cause guys like me
donate buildings.

364
00:22:12,044 --> 00:22:15,275
I wasn't speaking to you,
Mr. Melon.

365
00:22:22,254 --> 00:22:24,518
I don't think
Dr. Barbay understands...

366
00:22:24,556 --> 00:22:27,389
the actual amounts
that are involved here.

367
00:22:27,426 --> 00:22:31,658
Mr. Melon, will you take
the ceremonial shovel?

368
00:22:31,697 --> 00:22:32,664
Thank you.

369
00:22:32,698 --> 00:22:35,565
And dig into the symbolic dirt.

370
00:22:38,203 --> 00:22:43,163
I hereby dedicate
this building to... myself.

371
00:22:55,387 --> 00:22:57,378
Now, Dad, it's just like
we talked about.

372
00:22:57,423 --> 00:22:59,391
You sign up for whatever
interests you, OK?

373
00:22:59,425 --> 00:23:01,154
We're gonna get
on the astronomy line...

374
00:23:01,193 --> 00:23:03,184
before it closes up.
See you later.

375
00:23:04,997 --> 00:23:08,956
Look at this.
This is worse than the track.

376
00:23:09,001 --> 00:23:10,593
You want me to move
some people for you?

377
00:23:10,636 --> 00:23:11,694
No, don't push anybody around.

378
00:23:11,737 --> 00:23:14,331
This is college.
Let me think for a minute.

379
00:23:14,373 --> 00:23:15,965
What are you gonna do?

380
00:23:16,008 --> 00:23:18,374
Come on. I got an idea.

381
00:23:18,410 --> 00:23:19,377
Did you get
everything you want?

382
00:23:19,411 --> 00:23:22,107
I got the Latin
and the Sanskrit...

383
00:23:22,147 --> 00:23:23,774
but then they canceled
my Ancient Greek.

384
00:23:23,816 --> 00:23:25,784
Just blew my whole
dead languages motif.

385
00:23:25,818 --> 00:23:27,945
What are you looking at?

386
00:23:41,867 --> 00:23:44,267
You OK?

387
00:23:44,303 --> 00:23:47,830
Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.

388
00:23:47,873 --> 00:23:50,239
I'm just upset
because they closed botany.

389
00:23:50,275 --> 00:23:52,243
Those bastards!

390
00:23:52,277 --> 00:23:54,438
Well, I'm not that upset.

391
00:23:55,781 --> 00:23:58,511
At least, I won't be
if I get into astronomy.

392
00:23:58,550 --> 00:24:00,848
You want to cut
into line with us?

393
00:24:00,886 --> 00:24:01,944
'Cause we're already waiting.

394
00:24:01,987 --> 00:24:04,820
Yes. Yeah, I would.

395
00:24:04,857 --> 00:24:05,949
Great. All right.

396
00:24:09,862 --> 00:24:11,727
Oh, this is Derek.

397
00:24:11,764 --> 00:24:14,597
Hi.

398
00:24:14,633 --> 00:24:16,430
I'm Valerie Desmond.

399
00:24:16,468 --> 00:24:18,459
Yeah, I know.

400
00:24:19,838 --> 00:24:22,807
- I'm Jason Melon.
- Hi.

401
00:24:26,879 --> 00:24:29,109
- Hey, Valerie.
- Hi.

402
00:24:29,148 --> 00:24:30,615
God, you look great.

403
00:24:30,649 --> 00:24:33,243
Thanks. Are you taking
astronomy, too?

404
00:24:33,285 --> 00:24:35,185
Yeah, I guess so.

405
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:37,279
I don't really want to.
I'm a business major.

406
00:24:37,322 --> 00:24:40,348
But for some reason,
they want us to take a science.

407
00:24:40,392 --> 00:24:42,360
You mind if I sneak
in the line with you?

408
00:24:42,394 --> 00:24:45,295
Actually, these guys were
nice enough to let me in...

409
00:24:45,330 --> 00:24:48,731
so it's really
up to them, I guess.

410
00:24:48,767 --> 00:24:50,530
Melon, buddy?

411
00:24:50,569 --> 00:24:53,060
Whaddaya say? Let me in, OK?

412
00:24:53,105 --> 00:24:55,539
I don't think so, Osbourne.

413
00:24:55,574 --> 00:24:57,633
Melon, your friend...
straighten him out.

414
00:24:57,676 --> 00:24:59,268
Look, Chas,
there's a lot of people waiting.

415
00:24:59,311 --> 00:25:01,905
It wouldn't really be fair.

416
00:25:01,947 --> 00:25:03,107
I'll tell you what.

417
00:25:03,148 --> 00:25:07,209
Maybe if you got a note
from each of these people...

418
00:25:07,252 --> 00:25:09,379
saying that it was all right,
then we'd reconsider...

419
00:25:09,421 --> 00:25:11,218
but until that day,
take a hike...

420
00:25:11,256 --> 00:25:14,350
you elitist fraternity scumbag.

421
00:25:18,030 --> 00:25:20,089
I won't forget this, Melon.

422
00:25:20,132 --> 00:25:21,895
I'll see you at the pool.

423
00:25:21,934 --> 00:25:23,299
- Bye, Val.
- Bye.

424
00:25:23,335 --> 00:25:24,927
Thank you. I'm dead.

425
00:25:24,970 --> 00:25:26,938
You're not gonna believe this!

426
00:25:26,972 --> 00:25:29,566
- You're kidding!
- I'm not kidding! Just go!

427
00:25:29,608 --> 00:25:31,269
He's out there!

428
00:25:41,453 --> 00:25:44,854
Bruce! Bruce! Bruce! Bruce!

429
00:25:49,795 --> 00:25:51,194
Where is he?

430
00:25:51,230 --> 00:25:52,356
I don't know, kid.

431
00:25:52,397 --> 00:25:54,092
All I know is I'm supposed
to pick him up here.

432
00:25:54,132 --> 00:25:56,100
- When?
- Now.

433
00:25:56,134 --> 00:25:58,830
Come on, let's register.

434
00:26:07,512 --> 00:26:09,036
Hey, you guys
get everything you need?

435
00:26:09,081 --> 00:26:10,343
Oh, yeah, we got it.

436
00:26:10,382 --> 00:26:11,974
Good. What's with
the used books?

437
00:26:12,017 --> 00:26:14,417
- What's wrong with used books?
- They've already been read.

438
00:26:14,453 --> 00:26:16,250
And they've already been
underlined.

439
00:26:16,288 --> 00:26:17,516
That's the problem.

440
00:26:17,556 --> 00:26:19,786
The guy who underlined them
could have been a maniac.

441
00:26:19,825 --> 00:26:23,124
Get these guys some new books.

442
00:26:23,161 --> 00:26:26,096
Charge it to me, too.
Here, pick a card.

443
00:26:27,299 --> 00:26:30,132
And I'm taking four
of those school sweaters...

444
00:26:30,168 --> 00:26:32,864
a bunch of pennants,
some of those beer mugs...

445
00:26:32,905 --> 00:26:35,499
a few of these fuzz balls
you cheer with, and...

446
00:26:35,540 --> 00:26:38,771
Hey, folks, it's on me!
Shakespeare for everyone, OK?

447
00:26:40,379 --> 00:26:43,314
You, too, honey.
I'd like to tame your shrew.

448
00:26:43,348 --> 00:26:47,182
- Who is that?
- That is Mr. Thornton Melon...

449
00:26:47,219 --> 00:26:49,881
the world's oldest
living freshman...

450
00:26:49,922 --> 00:26:52,948
and the walking epitome of
the decline of modern education.

451
00:26:52,991 --> 00:26:55,391
The stupid clod thinks he can
buy his way out of the gutter.

452
00:26:55,427 --> 00:26:57,725
I don't think so.
He was just having fun.

453
00:26:57,763 --> 00:27:02,427
Oh, really? Well, I can't wait
to get him in my class.

454
00:27:02,467 --> 00:27:04,594
We'll see how much fun
he is then.

455
00:27:04,636 --> 00:27:05,796
Oh, Philip.

456
00:27:05,837 --> 00:27:08,863
Hey, Mr. M! You're all set.
We've been working all night.

457
00:27:08,907 --> 00:27:10,465
We got it all done.

458
00:27:10,509 --> 00:27:12,340
Thanks, Buzzy.
I appreciate it.

459
00:27:12,377 --> 00:27:15,676
Add a few hundred to the bill
and throw your boys a party.

460
00:27:15,714 --> 00:27:18,842
You know what you got, Mr. M?
You got class.

461
00:27:18,884 --> 00:27:22,081
It rubbed off from you, Buzzy.
Say hello to Sonia for me, huh?

462
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:23,314
You got it.

463
00:27:23,355 --> 00:27:26,256
I want to talk to you
about my schedule.

464
00:27:26,291 --> 00:27:28,452
We'll go over it later.

465
00:27:41,273 --> 00:27:43,605
Well, boys,
what do you think?

466
00:27:43,642 --> 00:27:45,507
Got a hot tub in there!

467
00:27:45,544 --> 00:27:47,705
How can you study
if you're not relaxed?

468
00:27:47,746 --> 00:27:48,906
When's our first class?

469
00:27:48,947 --> 00:27:51,108
We got economics
tomorrow at 11:00.

470
00:27:51,149 --> 00:27:52,309
11:00? No good.

471
00:27:52,351 --> 00:27:54,512
I got a massage at 11:00.
Tell them to make it 2:00.

472
00:27:54,553 --> 00:27:57,716
No, Dad, you don't get it.

473
00:27:57,756 --> 00:28:01,886
They're not gonna reschedule
the classes around your massage.

474
00:28:01,927 --> 00:28:04,487
All right, 11:00.
But I'm gonna talk to that dean.

475
00:28:04,529 --> 00:28:07,020
These classes can be
a real inconvenience.

476
00:28:07,065 --> 00:28:09,533
All right, settle down, people.

477
00:28:09,568 --> 00:28:12,560
We've got a lot to cover,
and time is short.

478
00:28:16,375 --> 00:28:19,401
There are two kinds of people
in business today...

479
00:28:19,444 --> 00:28:21,412
the quick and the dead.

480
00:28:21,446 --> 00:28:24,574
So, rather than waste
your time this semester...

481
00:28:24,616 --> 00:28:27,050
with a lot of
useless theories...

482
00:28:27,085 --> 00:28:29,110
we're going to jump right in
with both feet...

483
00:28:29,154 --> 00:28:32,055
and create a fictional company
from the ground up.

484
00:28:32,090 --> 00:28:35,116
We'll construct
our physical plant...

485
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:37,560
we'll set up
an efficient administrative...

486
00:28:37,596 --> 00:28:39,393
and executive structure...

487
00:28:39,431 --> 00:28:43,026
then we'll manufacture
our product and market it.

488
00:28:43,068 --> 00:28:45,730
I think you'll find it very
interesting and a lot of fun.

489
00:28:45,771 --> 00:28:49,332
So, let's start by looking
at construction costs...

490
00:28:49,374 --> 00:28:51,365
of our new factory.

491
00:28:51,410 --> 00:28:53,605
What's the product?

492
00:28:53,645 --> 00:28:54,839
That is immaterial...

493
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:57,007
for the purposes
of our discussion here...

494
00:28:57,049 --> 00:28:58,812
but if it makes you happy...

495
00:28:58,850 --> 00:29:01,011
let's say we're making
tape recorders.

496
00:29:01,053 --> 00:29:03,044
Tape recorders?
Are you kiddin'?

497
00:29:03,088 --> 00:29:06,546
The Japs will kill us
on the labor costs.

498
00:29:06,591 --> 00:29:08,559
OK, fine.

499
00:29:08,593 --> 00:29:11,357
Then let's just say
they're widgets.

500
00:29:11,396 --> 00:29:13,296
What's a widget?

501
00:29:13,331 --> 00:29:16,630
It's a fictional product.
It doesn't matter.

502
00:29:16,668 --> 00:29:18,727
Doesn't matter.
Tell that to the bank.

503
00:29:18,770 --> 00:29:20,897
Take it easy.
It's the first day.

504
00:29:20,939 --> 00:29:24,397
On the board,
you will see a cost analysis...

505
00:29:24,443 --> 00:29:27,037
for construction of
a 30,000 square-foot facility...

506
00:29:27,079 --> 00:29:29,775
which will encompass
both factory and office space...

507
00:29:29,815 --> 00:29:32,716
and is fully serviced
by all utilities...

508
00:29:32,751 --> 00:29:35,914
a railroad spur line
and a four-bay shipping dock.

509
00:29:35,954 --> 00:29:39,048
Hold it, hold it. Why build?
You're better off leasing...

510
00:29:39,091 --> 00:29:41,559
at a buck and a quarter,
a buck and a half a square foot.

511
00:29:41,593 --> 00:29:44,289
Take your down payment
and put it into CDs...

512
00:29:44,329 --> 00:29:46,559
or something else you can roll
over every couple of months.

513
00:29:46,598 --> 00:29:48,122
Thank you, Mr. Melon...

514
00:29:48,166 --> 00:29:50,964
but we'll be concentrating
on finance...

515
00:29:51,002 --> 00:29:53,562
a little later in the term.

516
00:29:53,605 --> 00:29:55,732
For the time being,
let's just concentrate...

517
00:29:55,774 --> 00:29:58,106
on the construction figures,
shall we?

518
00:29:58,143 --> 00:30:01,340
You'll see the final bottom line
requires the factoring in...

519
00:30:01,379 --> 00:30:03,847
of not just the material
and construction costs...

520
00:30:03,882 --> 00:30:08,842
but also the architects' fees
and the cost of land servicing.

521
00:30:08,887 --> 00:30:11,219
Oh, you left out
a bunch of stuff.

522
00:30:11,256 --> 00:30:13,224
Oh, really?

523
00:30:13,258 --> 00:30:15,283
Like what, for instance?

524
00:30:15,327 --> 00:30:18,626
First of all, you have to grease
the local politicians...

525
00:30:18,663 --> 00:30:20,858
for the sudden zoning problems
that always come up.

526
00:30:20,899 --> 00:30:23,493
Then there's the kickbacks
to the carpenters.

527
00:30:23,535 --> 00:30:25,503
And if you plan on using
any cement in this building...

528
00:30:25,537 --> 00:30:27,027
I'm sure the teamsters
would like to have...

529
00:30:27,072 --> 00:30:29,131
a little chat with you,
and that'll cost you.

530
00:30:29,174 --> 00:30:31,836
Don't forget a little something
for the building inspectors.

531
00:30:31,877 --> 00:30:34,971
There's the long-term costs,
such as waste disposal.

532
00:30:35,013 --> 00:30:37,038
I don't know if you're familiar
with who runs that business...

533
00:30:37,082 --> 00:30:39,141
but I assure you
it's not the boy scouts.

534
00:30:39,184 --> 00:30:40,549
That will be quite enough,
Mr. Melon.

535
00:30:40,585 --> 00:30:42,712
Maybe bribes and kickbacks...

536
00:30:42,754 --> 00:30:46,121
and Mafia payoffs
are how you do business...

537
00:30:46,158 --> 00:30:48,922
but they are not part of
the legitimate business world...

538
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:50,860
and they're certainly
not part of anything...

539
00:30:50,896 --> 00:30:53,364
I'm teaching in this class.
Do I make myself clear?

540
00:30:53,398 --> 00:30:56,231
Sorry. Just trying to help.
That's all.

541
00:30:56,268 --> 00:31:01,331
Now, notwithstanding
Mr. Melon's input...

542
00:31:01,373 --> 00:31:05,503
the next question for us is
where to build our factory.

543
00:31:05,544 --> 00:31:07,978
How about Fantasyland?

544
00:31:11,516 --> 00:31:14,417
My first class.
I did good, huh?

545
00:31:14,452 --> 00:31:16,852
You better cool it
with Dr. Barbay.

546
00:31:16,888 --> 00:31:18,651
Dr. Barbay, he don't know dick.

547
00:31:18,690 --> 00:31:20,624
He really tells it
like it ain't.

548
00:31:20,659 --> 00:31:23,219
Know what he knows how to do?
Flunk you.

549
00:31:23,261 --> 00:31:25,627
Flunk me? Flunk him.

550
00:31:25,664 --> 00:31:28,428
Great attitude. Do you know
where your next class is?

551
00:31:28,466 --> 00:31:31,435
Contemporary American history.
Professor Turgeson.

552
00:31:31,469 --> 00:31:33,903
- Turgeson?
- You know him? Is he good?

553
00:31:33,939 --> 00:31:36,271
Well, he's really committed.

554
00:31:36,308 --> 00:31:38,538
In fact, I think he was.
Just keep your head down...

555
00:31:38,577 --> 00:31:40,340
and your mouth shut.
You should be all right.

556
00:31:40,378 --> 00:31:41,902
- I'll see you in English.
- All right.

557
00:31:41,947 --> 00:31:45,439
Welcome to Contemporary
American history.

558
00:31:45,483 --> 00:31:47,678
I'm Professor Turgeson.

559
00:31:47,719 --> 00:31:50,187
I know a lot of people
think history is just facts...

560
00:31:50,222 --> 00:31:54,215
just information about the past,
but not me.

561
00:31:54,259 --> 00:31:57,558
I hold history
very sacred. Sacred.

562
00:31:57,596 --> 00:32:00,087
The way a farmer looks at
the Earth and holds it sacred.

563
00:32:00,131 --> 00:32:02,122
The way a Christian
takes the Bible...

564
00:32:02,167 --> 00:32:03,429
and he holds it sacred.

565
00:32:03,468 --> 00:32:06,403
The way a lot of people
hold their marriage sacred.

566
00:32:06,438 --> 00:32:08,770
That's how I feel about it.
So why don't we dive right in...

567
00:32:08,807 --> 00:32:11,571
by interpreting
one of the easiest events...

568
00:32:11,610 --> 00:32:14,807
in the last twenty years
of American history.

569
00:32:14,846 --> 00:32:17,280
Now, can someone tell me...

570
00:32:17,315 --> 00:32:21,752
why, in 1975, we pulled
our troops out of Vietnam?

571
00:32:23,288 --> 00:32:26,052
The failure of Vietnamization
to win popular support...

572
00:32:26,091 --> 00:32:28,059
caused an ongoing erosion
of confidence...

573
00:32:28,093 --> 00:32:31,324
in the various American...
but illegal... Saigon regimes.

574
00:32:35,734 --> 00:32:36,928
Is she right?

575
00:32:39,137 --> 00:32:40,695
'Cause I know
that's the popular version...

576
00:32:40,739 --> 00:32:42,070
of what went on there.

577
00:32:42,107 --> 00:32:44,166
I know a lot of people
like to believe that.

578
00:32:44,209 --> 00:32:46,234
I wish I could,
but I was there.

579
00:32:46,278 --> 00:32:47,768
I wasn't here in a classroom...

580
00:32:47,812 --> 00:32:49,336
hoping I was right,
thinking about it.

581
00:32:49,381 --> 00:32:52,111
I was up to my knees
in rice paddies...

582
00:32:52,150 --> 00:32:54,618
with guns that didn't work,
going up against Charlie...

583
00:32:54,653 --> 00:32:57,588
slugging it out with him,
while pussies like you...

584
00:32:57,622 --> 00:33:00,489
were back here partyin',
puttin' headbands on...

585
00:33:00,525 --> 00:33:03,460
doin' drugs, listening
to the goddamn Beatle albums!

586
00:33:06,197 --> 00:33:08,131
Hey, Professor,
take it easy, will ya?

587
00:33:08,166 --> 00:33:11,033
These kids were in grade school
at the time.

588
00:33:11,069 --> 00:33:12,366
And me...

589
00:33:12,404 --> 00:33:15,237
I'm not a fighter, I'm a lover.

590
00:33:19,110 --> 00:33:22,011
Well, I didn't know you wanted
to get involved...

591
00:33:22,047 --> 00:33:25,414
with the discussion,
Mr. Helper.

592
00:33:25,450 --> 00:33:28,886
But since you want to help,
maybe you can help me, OK?

593
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:30,820
You remember that thing
we had about thirty years ago...

594
00:33:30,855 --> 00:33:32,220
called the Korean conflict?

595
00:33:32,257 --> 00:33:35,454
Yeah. Where we failed
to achieve victory.

596
00:33:35,493 --> 00:33:37,893
How come we didn't cross
the 38th parallel...

597
00:33:37,929 --> 00:33:40,989
and push those rice-eaters back
to the Great Wall of China...

598
00:33:41,032 --> 00:33:43,023
and take it apart
brick by brick...

599
00:33:43,068 --> 00:33:45,502
and nuke them back into
the fuckin' stone age forever?

600
00:33:45,537 --> 00:33:48,995
How come? Tell me?
Why? Say it! Say it!

601
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:51,201
All right, I'll say it.

602
00:33:51,242 --> 00:33:53,335
'Cause Truman was too much
of a pussy wimp...

603
00:33:53,378 --> 00:33:57,007
to let MacArthur go in and blow
out those commie bastards!

604
00:33:58,717 --> 00:34:01,845
Good answer. Good answer.

605
00:34:03,288 --> 00:34:06,052
I like the way you think.

606
00:34:06,091 --> 00:34:09,492
I'm gonna be watching you.

607
00:34:11,696 --> 00:34:14,961
Good teacher.
He really seems to care.

608
00:34:14,999 --> 00:34:17,331
About what, I have no idea.

609
00:34:18,403 --> 00:34:20,268
College is all right,
I'll tell you that.

610
00:34:20,305 --> 00:34:22,637
Hey, buddy, be my guest.
Here's a pen.

611
00:34:22,674 --> 00:34:26,508
Boys, here's a couple of pens,
in case you learn how to write.

612
00:34:26,544 --> 00:34:28,808
- I know you.
- Oh, yeah? Here's a pen.

613
00:34:28,847 --> 00:34:31,077
You do those
obnoxious commercials.

614
00:34:31,116 --> 00:34:32,447
You're tall and fat.

615
00:34:32,484 --> 00:34:36,477
Yeah, you're short and ugly.
Give me the pen back, will ya?

616
00:34:36,521 --> 00:34:38,751
Honey, here's a pen.

617
00:34:38,790 --> 00:34:41,190
Boys, how are ya?

618
00:35:03,014 --> 00:35:04,447
"And Gibraltar is a girl...

619
00:35:04,482 --> 00:35:07,144
"where I was a flower
of the mountain.

620
00:35:07,185 --> 00:35:09,153
"Yes, when I put
the rose in my hair...

621
00:35:09,187 --> 00:35:10,654
"like the
Andalusian girls used.

622
00:35:10,688 --> 00:35:12,747
"Or shall I wear red?

623
00:35:12,791 --> 00:35:15,624
"Yes. And how he kissed me
under the Moorish wall...

624
00:35:15,660 --> 00:35:16,786
"and I thought...

625
00:35:16,828 --> 00:35:18,762
"well, as well him as another.

626
00:35:18,797 --> 00:35:21,095
"And then I ask him
with my eyes to ask again.

627
00:35:21,132 --> 00:35:24,795
"Yes. And then he asked me
would I yes to say yes.

628
00:35:24,836 --> 00:35:26,394
"My mountain flower.

629
00:35:26,438 --> 00:35:28,736
"And first I put my arms
around him, yes...

630
00:35:28,773 --> 00:35:30,240
"and drew him down to me...

631
00:35:30,275 --> 00:35:32,903
"so he could feel my breasts
all perfumed, yes...

632
00:35:32,944 --> 00:35:35,242
"and his heart was going
like mad, and yes...

633
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:37,271
"I said, yes, I will, yes."

634
00:35:37,315 --> 00:35:40,512
Yes! Yes!

635
00:35:45,690 --> 00:35:47,658
Thanks for the vote
of confidence.

636
00:35:47,692 --> 00:35:49,159
I think Joyce
is pretty hot, too.

637
00:35:49,194 --> 00:35:51,094
And now that
I've got your attention...

638
00:35:51,129 --> 00:35:52,528
I'd like to run down
the reading list...

639
00:35:52,564 --> 00:35:55,624
for the semester.
See what else turns you on.

640
00:36:01,539 --> 00:36:03,302
What a woman.

641
00:36:03,341 --> 00:36:05,639
Dad, she is the teacher.

642
00:36:05,677 --> 00:36:07,167
I know. I like teachers.

643
00:36:07,212 --> 00:36:09,544
If you do something wrong,
they make you do it over again.

644
00:36:11,316 --> 00:36:13,807
Don't you think maybe
you should just take some notes?

645
00:36:13,852 --> 00:36:16,412
Yeah, yeah.

646
00:36:16,454 --> 00:36:20,356
I gave away all my pens.

647
00:36:20,391 --> 00:36:22,757
I'm sorry. I need this back.

648
00:36:22,794 --> 00:36:24,955
Here's a calendar for you.

649
00:36:28,299 --> 00:36:29,493
Oh, hiya.

650
00:36:29,534 --> 00:36:32,401
Hello, Mr. Melon.
You waiting for me?

651
00:36:32,437 --> 00:36:35,133
Yes, I was. Look,
I know I'm only a freshman...

652
00:36:35,173 --> 00:36:37,539
but what do you say
you and I have dinner tonight?

653
00:36:37,575 --> 00:36:40,840
We could talk about Joyce.
She's my favorite writer.

654
00:36:42,881 --> 00:36:45,406
You're not the usual freshman,
but I'm sorry, I can't.

655
00:36:45,450 --> 00:36:47,315
The thing is,
I'm sort of going with someone.

656
00:36:47,352 --> 00:36:49,513
Oh. Where you going?

657
00:36:49,554 --> 00:36:52,045
That's a good question.

658
00:36:52,090 --> 00:36:54,752
Actually, I'd like to join you,
but I have class tonight.

659
00:36:54,792 --> 00:36:58,057
- How about tomorrow night?
- I have class then, too.

660
00:36:58,096 --> 00:36:59,825
I'll tell you what, then.

661
00:36:59,864 --> 00:37:03,823
Why don't you call me
when you have no class?

662
00:37:03,868 --> 00:37:06,098
All right. Maybe I will.

663
00:37:11,976 --> 00:37:14,467
Hello, Philip.

664
00:37:14,512 --> 00:37:16,639
What did he want?

665
00:37:16,681 --> 00:37:19,582
Oh, what do all men want?

666
00:37:19,617 --> 00:37:21,551
He wants you to dress up
as Wonder Woman...

667
00:37:21,586 --> 00:37:25,113
tie him up with a golden lariat
and force him to tell the truth?

668
00:37:25,156 --> 00:37:27,556
No, just dinner, Philip.

669
00:37:27,592 --> 00:37:30,686
Are you jealous
of Thornton Melon?

670
00:37:30,728 --> 00:37:32,787
Certainly not.

671
00:37:32,830 --> 00:37:35,731
I've been doing a great deal
of thinking lately.

672
00:37:35,767 --> 00:37:39,032
I've been thinking about us.

673
00:37:39,070 --> 00:37:41,538
- And?
- And I think...

674
00:37:41,573 --> 00:37:44,940
we should start thinking
about forming a...

675
00:37:44,976 --> 00:37:46,705
well, um...

676
00:37:46,744 --> 00:37:47,870
A merger?

677
00:37:47,912 --> 00:37:50,278
A merger, exactly.
Exactly, a merger.

678
00:37:50,315 --> 00:37:52,875
A partnership.
Seriously, Diane...

679
00:37:52,917 --> 00:37:55,613
we're both intelligent,
well-educated adults.

680
00:37:55,653 --> 00:37:59,953
We should be together.
Incorporated, if you will.

681
00:37:59,991 --> 00:38:05,122
Look at the balance sheet.
We were made for one another.

682
00:38:05,163 --> 00:38:06,528
Oh, Philip, you darling.

683
00:38:06,564 --> 00:38:08,725
I don't want to be merged
or incorporated.

684
00:38:08,766 --> 00:38:12,634
I want to have fun
and be romanced and be loved.

685
00:38:14,505 --> 00:38:16,598
So let's not rush
into anything.

686
00:38:16,641 --> 00:38:19,474
Let's just start
by having fun, OK?

687
00:38:23,414 --> 00:38:25,712
Hey, how are you?
What's happening?

688
00:38:25,750 --> 00:38:26,944
Hi!

689
00:38:26,985 --> 00:38:28,885
A lot of people are talking
about your dad, man.

690
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:30,854
What's happening?

691
00:38:30,888 --> 00:38:33,686
Hey, boys, how ya doin'?

692
00:38:33,725 --> 00:38:36,057
I wonder why.

693
00:38:37,595 --> 00:38:39,256
They have lockers.

694
00:38:39,297 --> 00:38:41,424
You could've changed here.

695
00:38:41,466 --> 00:38:43,457
I don't change
in front of guys.

696
00:38:43,501 --> 00:38:45,366
Next thing you know, you're
showering with the fellas.

697
00:38:45,403 --> 00:38:46,802
And the next thing you know...

698
00:38:46,838 --> 00:38:48,772
you're pinned to a sophomore
named Chip.

699
00:38:48,806 --> 00:38:50,364
Come on, let's go, huh?

700
00:38:50,408 --> 00:38:52,000
I'll see you later.

701
00:39:22,774 --> 00:39:25,174
That was pretty good.

702
00:39:25,209 --> 00:39:27,006
Next time, hold the pike
a little longer.

703
00:39:29,213 --> 00:39:31,306
Wait a minute.
I'll be right down.

704
00:39:55,306 --> 00:39:57,740
Not bad.

705
00:39:57,775 --> 00:40:00,266
All right, let's see one more.

706
00:40:01,479 --> 00:40:02,878
Like I showed you.

707
00:40:02,914 --> 00:40:04,074
All right.

708
00:40:10,047 --> 00:40:12,948
What's a guy your age
doing here with these kids?

709
00:40:12,984 --> 00:40:16,613
I'm lookin' for the fountain
of middle age.

710
00:40:16,654 --> 00:40:18,019
What's your story?

711
00:40:18,055 --> 00:40:20,546
I'm setting the new record for
the most consecutive losses...

712
00:40:20,591 --> 00:40:23,492
by a diving coach
in this conference.

713
00:40:23,528 --> 00:40:25,792
Hey, remember,
hold that pike longer.

714
00:40:25,830 --> 00:40:28,128
- That your kid?
- Yeah.

715
00:40:28,165 --> 00:40:30,395
Who coached him in high school?

716
00:40:30,434 --> 00:40:31,924
Yours truly.

717
00:40:31,969 --> 00:40:33,596
So, where did you learn
how to dive?

718
00:40:33,638 --> 00:40:37,074
Atlantic City. The Steel Pier.
I was in the water show.

719
00:40:37,108 --> 00:40:38,632
I used to open
for the diving horse.

720
00:40:38,676 --> 00:40:40,576
You're kiddin'.
I'm from Jersey.

721
00:40:40,611 --> 00:40:43,944
I practically spent
my entire life on that pier.

722
00:40:43,981 --> 00:40:46,541
There was a guy,
did the most amazing dive...

723
00:40:46,584 --> 00:40:48,245
called the Triple Lindy.

724
00:40:48,286 --> 00:40:49,981
Hardest dive
I ever saw in my life.

725
00:40:50,021 --> 00:40:52,717
- Who was that guy?
- Yours truly.

726
00:40:52,757 --> 00:40:54,224
You're kiddin'.

727
00:40:54,258 --> 00:40:56,021
I don't joke about dives.

728
00:40:56,060 --> 00:40:57,857
Especially that one.
It almost killed me.

729
00:40:57,895 --> 00:41:00,955
Boy, you were somethin' else.

730
00:41:00,998 --> 00:41:03,023
Hey, can your kid do that dive?

731
00:41:03,067 --> 00:41:06,127
Nah, nobody can.
It's too dangerous.

732
00:41:06,170 --> 00:41:09,139
You know, he tried out
for the team last semester.

733
00:41:09,173 --> 00:41:10,538
He didn't do that good.

734
00:41:10,575 --> 00:41:13,567
Not that good, huh? Watch this.

735
00:41:13,611 --> 00:41:16,375
Jason, do the two and a half!

736
00:41:31,028 --> 00:41:33,155
Not bad.

737
00:41:34,865 --> 00:41:36,162
My main Melon.
Come on, man...

738
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:37,690
there's a pep rally
for the football team.

739
00:41:37,735 --> 00:41:39,726
- Let's go. We're there.
- Whoa, wait. What is this?

740
00:41:39,770 --> 00:41:43,035
Me and Standish and Redding
are doing the anti-pep rally...

741
00:41:43,074 --> 00:41:45,872
to point out that a violent
ground acquisition game...

742
00:41:45,910 --> 00:41:47,241
such as football is, in fact...

743
00:41:47,278 --> 00:41:49,075
a crypto-fascist metaphor
for nuclear war.

744
00:41:49,113 --> 00:41:51,206
It sounds like
a lot of laughs...

745
00:41:51,248 --> 00:41:52,579
but I'm supposed
to meet my dad and study.

746
00:41:52,617 --> 00:41:54,084
He's supposed
to be here already.

747
00:41:54,118 --> 00:41:56,086
OK, well...

748
00:41:56,120 --> 00:41:59,180
if you change your mind, pal,
you know where I'll be.

749
00:41:59,223 --> 00:42:02,886
If I change my mind,
I'll seek psychiatric help.

750
00:42:21,712 --> 00:42:22,906
Excuse me.

751
00:42:22,947 --> 00:42:26,405
What is the Oort system
and what does it tell us?

752
00:42:28,452 --> 00:42:30,420
What? I'm sorry.

753
00:42:30,454 --> 00:42:33,912
Astronomy, chapter two.

754
00:42:33,958 --> 00:42:36,153
Oh, Oort, Oort.

755
00:42:36,193 --> 00:42:38,718
Oort was this scientist,
and he figured out...

756
00:42:38,763 --> 00:42:43,097
that the smeared-out density
of matter can be no greater...

757
00:42:43,134 --> 00:42:46,331
than the solar mass
per cubic parsec.

758
00:42:46,370 --> 00:42:48,395
You look thrilled.
It's not my theory.

759
00:42:49,807 --> 00:42:52,776
Thanks, that helps a lot.

760
00:42:53,778 --> 00:42:55,973
Listen, I was
just wondering...

761
00:42:56,013 --> 00:42:57,605
would you do
my astronomy homework...

762
00:42:57,648 --> 00:42:59,172
for the rest of the semester?

763
00:43:01,886 --> 00:43:04,047
- Here you go.
- OK, right.

764
00:43:04,088 --> 00:43:05,487
Hi, Mr. Melon.

765
00:43:05,523 --> 00:43:08,083
Oh, you can call me Thornton.

766
00:43:08,125 --> 00:43:11,094
Say, how about joining me
and my friend over there?

767
00:43:11,128 --> 00:43:13,119
Your friend looks
a little strange.

768
00:43:13,164 --> 00:43:16,133
Who, Lou? Lou's an animal.
Why, in his family...

769
00:43:16,167 --> 00:43:20,536
he's only the second generation
that's standing up straight.

770
00:43:20,571 --> 00:43:22,061
What lovely girls.

771
00:43:22,106 --> 00:43:25,132
How would you like a life
of luxury and deceit?

772
00:43:25,176 --> 00:43:27,508
Come on, join us in a beer. OK?

773
00:43:27,545 --> 00:43:29,479
- Yeah, OK.
- OK.

774
00:43:39,156 --> 00:43:42,319
Girls, this is Lou.
Lou, these are girls.

775
00:43:45,429 --> 00:43:47,090
One, two.

776
00:43:47,131 --> 00:43:49,656
One, two.

777
00:43:56,407 --> 00:43:58,568
Shake it up, baby

778
00:44:00,377 --> 00:44:02,504
Twist and shout

779
00:44:04,181 --> 00:44:06,274
Come on, come on, come on, baby

780
00:44:08,285 --> 00:44:10,515
Come and work it on out

781
00:44:12,423 --> 00:44:14,857
Work it on out, honey

782
00:44:16,761 --> 00:44:19,889
Honey, come here. I need
2 more glasses for the girls...

783
00:44:19,930 --> 00:44:22,228
and also,
bring a pitcher of beer...

784
00:44:22,266 --> 00:44:24,291
every seven minutes
till somebody passes out.

785
00:44:24,335 --> 00:44:26,132
And then bring one
every ten minutes.

786
00:44:26,170 --> 00:44:27,569
You got it. Anyway...

787
00:44:27,605 --> 00:44:30,096
I thought we were gonna go...

788
00:44:30,141 --> 00:44:32,769
to the planetarium
and look at a lot of stars.

789
00:44:32,810 --> 00:44:35,506
I had no idea this was
gonna be astrophysics.

790
00:44:35,546 --> 00:44:38,310
It's not that hard.
You'll get it.

791
00:44:38,349 --> 00:44:41,716
It's not hard for you,
because you're smart.

792
00:44:41,752 --> 00:44:43,845
You're smart, too.

793
00:44:43,888 --> 00:44:46,322
Yeah, but you're, like,
"smart" smart.

794
00:44:46,357 --> 00:44:48,325
Do you study at the library
every night?

795
00:44:48,359 --> 00:44:49,917
No. I was gonna meet
my dad there...

796
00:44:49,960 --> 00:44:51,325
but he must be studying
at the dorm.

797
00:45:02,072 --> 00:45:04,097
Shake it up, baby

798
00:45:05,843 --> 00:45:07,640
Twist and shout

799
00:45:09,613 --> 00:45:11,808
Come on, come on, come on, baby

800
00:45:13,617 --> 00:45:15,983
Come on and work it on out

801
00:45:17,588 --> 00:45:19,488
You know you twist it,
little girl

802
00:45:19,523 --> 00:45:21,218
Lower, baby, lower.

803
00:45:21,258 --> 00:45:23,818
Hey, guys,
let me see some I.D.

804
00:45:23,861 --> 00:45:25,795
Not that low, baby.

805
00:45:25,830 --> 00:45:28,094
Come on and twist a little
closer now

806
00:45:28,132 --> 00:45:29,895
To the left, baby, to the left.

807
00:45:29,934 --> 00:45:31,526
And let me know you're mine

808
00:45:31,569 --> 00:45:32,797
That's the spot, baby.

809
00:45:32,837 --> 00:45:35,897
Hold it, hold it!
Oh, you are there!

810
00:45:35,940 --> 00:45:37,965
Shake it, baby

811
00:45:38,008 --> 00:45:41,637
Shake it, shake it, baby

812
00:45:41,679 --> 00:45:45,445
Come on and shake it,
shake it, shake it, baby

813
00:45:47,518 --> 00:45:49,281
- Shake it now
- Shake it

814
00:46:00,297 --> 00:46:01,696
OK, go ahead.

815
00:46:05,402 --> 00:46:07,632
Jason, what are you doing here?

816
00:46:07,671 --> 00:46:10,834
What am I doing here?
What are you doing here?

817
00:46:10,875 --> 00:46:13,105
We were supposed to study,
remember, in the library?

818
00:46:13,143 --> 00:46:15,043
The library.
I was supposed to be there.

819
00:46:15,079 --> 00:46:17,445
Hey, what's going on?

820
00:46:17,481 --> 00:46:19,472
Chas, check it out.

821
00:46:22,586 --> 00:46:24,713
Hey, Clark.

822
00:46:24,755 --> 00:46:26,689
Interesting little rally
you guys had tonight.

823
00:46:26,724 --> 00:46:29,591
Yeah, right. They got paint
all over my girlfriend.

824
00:46:29,627 --> 00:46:31,561
I'm gonna kill
them little pinheads.

825
00:46:31,595 --> 00:46:33,426
Yeah? Well, you came
to the right place...

826
00:46:33,464 --> 00:46:35,796
because guess who's here...
Derek Lutz.

827
00:46:41,906 --> 00:46:44,431
Hey, Lutz!

828
00:46:44,475 --> 00:46:46,033
You know who I am?

829
00:46:46,076 --> 00:46:47,941
Let me see...

830
00:46:47,978 --> 00:46:50,572
protruding
supra-orbital ridges...

831
00:46:50,614 --> 00:46:54,209
small cranium,
1,300 C.C. Brain...

832
00:46:54,251 --> 00:46:55,445
Neanderthal man.

833
00:46:55,486 --> 00:46:58,546
You... I want you
to call his mother.

834
00:46:58,589 --> 00:47:00,386
You tell her
he's never coming home.

835
00:47:00,424 --> 00:47:03,018
Whoa, hold it. You sure
you even got the right guy?

836
00:47:03,060 --> 00:47:04,823
Look how many people
got blue hair these days.

837
00:47:04,862 --> 00:47:06,329
Shut up, meathead.

838
00:47:06,363 --> 00:47:07,694
Take it easy, will ya?

839
00:47:07,731 --> 00:47:11,462
I mean, the war's over.
Get new parts for your head.

840
00:47:11,502 --> 00:47:14,198
Yeah? Want to make
something of it?

841
00:47:14,238 --> 00:47:17,537
Oh, no. I never get physical.
I just get upset...

842
00:47:17,574 --> 00:47:21,510
and when I get upset,
he gets physical.

843
00:47:28,919 --> 00:47:30,443
You got a problem?

844
00:47:30,487 --> 00:47:32,512
No, I haven't got a problem.

845
00:47:32,556 --> 00:47:34,922
Now you do.

846
00:47:45,502 --> 00:47:46,901
Get him!

847
00:47:58,615 --> 00:47:59,809
Lou, where you been?

848
00:47:59,850 --> 00:48:01,715
I'm getting my ass kicked
all over the place!

849
00:48:27,578 --> 00:48:30,342
- Well, you look terrible.
- No, I'm all right.

850
00:48:30,381 --> 00:48:34,147
It's Lou I'm worried about.
He may lose his trigger finger.

851
00:48:34,184 --> 00:48:35,446
It serves you guys right.

852
00:48:35,486 --> 00:48:37,545
Why did you have to take on
the whole football team?

853
00:48:37,588 --> 00:48:38,748
They're not that tough.

854
00:48:38,789 --> 00:48:41,121
The football team
at my high school was tough.

855
00:48:41,158 --> 00:48:42,785
After they sacked
the quarterback...

856
00:48:42,826 --> 00:48:44,691
they went after his family.

857
00:48:47,064 --> 00:48:49,259
This morning we're going to look
at "The Great Gatsby"...

858
00:48:49,299 --> 00:48:51,460
by F. Scott Fitzgerald.

859
00:48:51,502 --> 00:48:54,903
Mr. Melon, how would you
characterize "The Great Gatsby?"

860
00:48:54,938 --> 00:48:56,872
Who, him?

861
00:48:56,907 --> 00:48:58,340
No, you.

862
00:48:58,375 --> 00:48:59,774
Me.

863
00:48:59,810 --> 00:49:02,870
Well, "The Great Gatsby,"
he was...

864
00:49:02,913 --> 00:49:05,108
great.

865
00:49:08,252 --> 00:49:09,844
See me after class, Mr. Melon.

866
00:49:13,857 --> 00:49:15,722
I mean, please,
try to understand.

867
00:49:15,759 --> 00:49:17,317
I don't have
the background for this.

868
00:49:17,361 --> 00:49:18,623
The high school I went to...

869
00:49:18,662 --> 00:49:20,323
they asked a kid to prove
the law of gravity.

870
00:49:20,364 --> 00:49:22,662
He threw the teacher
out the window.

871
00:49:22,699 --> 00:49:27,898
I know what I need.
I need a tutor.

872
00:49:27,938 --> 00:49:30,406
What do you say? Come on.

873
00:49:30,441 --> 00:49:33,001
You got some spare time.

874
00:49:33,043 --> 00:49:34,374
All right, Mr. Melon.

875
00:49:34,411 --> 00:49:36,174
I have some spare time
this evening.

876
00:49:36,213 --> 00:49:38,374
Why don't you come around
about 7:00?

877
00:49:38,415 --> 00:49:41,009
- Great.
- I'll give you my address.

878
00:49:42,186 --> 00:49:44,552
- Thanks.
- Please be on time.

879
00:49:44,588 --> 00:49:47,022
I'll be on time.

880
00:49:48,826 --> 00:49:50,760
What penmanship.

881
00:49:52,196 --> 00:49:55,893
"Everywhere the ceremony
of innocence is drowned;

882
00:49:55,933 --> 00:49:57,594
"The best
lack all conviction...

883
00:49:57,634 --> 00:50:00,899
"while the worst are full
of passionate intensity."

884
00:50:00,938 --> 00:50:02,530
There's a lot
of other stuff here.

885
00:50:02,573 --> 00:50:06,771
Yeats goes on and on...
and here's the finish.

886
00:50:06,810 --> 00:50:09,973
"What rough beast,
its hour come round at last...

887
00:50:10,013 --> 00:50:12,914
"slouches towards Bethlehem
to be born?"

888
00:50:12,950 --> 00:50:14,577
What does that
make you think of?

889
00:50:14,618 --> 00:50:17,610
Rough beast. My ex-wife.

890
00:50:17,654 --> 00:50:18,985
Well, that's
one interpretation.

891
00:50:19,022 --> 00:50:21,013
Not the right one,
but it's a start.

892
00:50:21,058 --> 00:50:23,390
Surely a man of your age
and experience...

893
00:50:23,427 --> 00:50:25,088
must have read some
of the things on my list.

894
00:50:25,129 --> 00:50:27,757
- What about "Macbeth"?
- I saw the movie.

895
00:50:27,798 --> 00:50:30,892
Orson Welles.
Great actor, big actor.

896
00:50:30,934 --> 00:50:33,402
He was a Tall and Fat
customer for years.

897
00:50:33,437 --> 00:50:34,699
How about
"Cat on a Hot Tin Roof"?

898
00:50:34,738 --> 00:50:36,672
I saw the movie. Burl lves.

899
00:50:36,707 --> 00:50:40,234
Great actor, extra stout.
He was a customer, too.

900
00:50:40,277 --> 00:50:42,939
- "Streetcar Named Desire."
- Great movie. Marlon Brando.

901
00:50:42,980 --> 00:50:46,541
He wasn't that big then,
but he ballooned up nicely.

902
00:50:46,583 --> 00:50:49,245
I'd say pound for pound,
our finest American actor.

903
00:50:49,286 --> 00:50:51,254
Don't you ever read?

904
00:50:51,288 --> 00:50:54,849
Who has time? I see the movie.
I'm in and out in two hours.

905
00:50:54,892 --> 00:50:56,291
Oh, Thornton, don't you see?

906
00:50:56,326 --> 00:50:58,123
The reason you want
to read these works...

907
00:50:58,162 --> 00:51:00,096
is so you can experience them
for yourself...

908
00:51:00,130 --> 00:51:02,928
so you can share the thoughts
and feelings of the writer...

909
00:51:02,966 --> 00:51:05,457
without the interference
of your actor and director...

910
00:51:05,502 --> 00:51:07,333
and professor's point of view
getting in the way...

911
00:51:07,371 --> 00:51:10,169
to truly share
and understand...

912
00:51:10,207 --> 00:51:12,107
the common feelings
of all mankind...

913
00:51:12,142 --> 00:51:14,440
the feelings of being alive.

914
00:51:16,046 --> 00:51:18,105
That was beautiful.

915
00:51:18,148 --> 00:51:20,116
I understand
what you're saying, too.

916
00:51:20,150 --> 00:51:21,947
I'm glad.
That makes me feel good.

917
00:51:21,985 --> 00:51:24,283
I got an idea.

918
00:51:24,321 --> 00:51:27,484
Let's keep talking over dinner.

919
00:51:27,524 --> 00:51:29,617
I'm supposed to meet
someone for dinner.

920
00:51:30,827 --> 00:51:33,295
I could cancel,
though, I guess.

921
00:51:33,330 --> 00:51:34,661
We are working, after all.

922
00:51:34,698 --> 00:51:36,529
You can't work
on an empty stomach.

923
00:51:36,567 --> 00:51:39,559
You can't concentrate
when you're hungry.

924
00:51:39,603 --> 00:51:41,571
Oh, I don't know.
I really shouldn't.

925
00:51:41,605 --> 00:51:44,472
- I have so many things to do.
- Oh, come on. I'll help you.

926
00:51:44,508 --> 00:51:46,533
I'll take out the garbage.
I'll do the dishes.

927
00:51:46,577 --> 00:51:48,408
I'll do your nails.
I'll do your hair.

928
00:51:48,445 --> 00:51:50,208
You have no idea
what I want to do.

929
00:51:50,247 --> 00:51:52,215
- I'll call him.
- I'll dial it!

930
00:51:52,249 --> 00:51:54,911
I'll just get the light.

931
00:51:54,952 --> 00:51:57,887
I think I'm attracted
to teachers.

932
00:51:57,921 --> 00:52:00,481
I took out an English teacher.
That didn't work out at all.

933
00:52:00,524 --> 00:52:03,049
I sent her a love letter.
She corrected it.

934
00:52:05,495 --> 00:52:07,622
Oh, great. Company.

935
00:52:11,868 --> 00:52:14,996
- Those two ought to get a room.
- Really.

936
00:52:15,038 --> 00:52:16,505
Actually,
I was married twice.

937
00:52:16,540 --> 00:52:20,203
My first wife, Jason's mother,
I really loved her.

938
00:52:20,244 --> 00:52:22,576
We had a good thing going,
you know?

939
00:52:22,613 --> 00:52:24,808
She passed away
about ten years ago.

940
00:52:24,848 --> 00:52:27,476
After that, I screwed around
for a few years.

941
00:52:27,517 --> 00:52:30,816
Then I really went nuts...
I married Vanessa.

942
00:52:30,854 --> 00:52:32,879
I was just lonely, I guess.

943
00:52:32,923 --> 00:52:34,185
Is that over now?

944
00:52:34,224 --> 00:52:35,919
We were doomed from the start.

945
00:52:35,959 --> 00:52:37,927
I'm an earth sign,
she's a water sign.

946
00:52:37,961 --> 00:52:39,189
Together, we made mud.

947
00:52:39,229 --> 00:52:42,721
I picked a beauty.
And she played around, too.

948
00:52:42,766 --> 00:52:45,428
When she said, "I do,"
I should have said, "With who?"

949
00:52:45,469 --> 00:52:47,869
So, are you
giving up on women?

950
00:52:47,904 --> 00:52:50,202
I don't know.
I can't figure women out.

951
00:52:50,240 --> 00:52:51,537
Today, they're independent.

952
00:52:51,575 --> 00:52:53,440
They only think
about themselves.

953
00:52:53,477 --> 00:52:56,674
During sex, Vanessa used
to scream out her own name.

954
00:52:58,749 --> 00:53:00,216
I think it's the men
who are different.

955
00:53:00,250 --> 00:53:01,512
Ever since
the women's movement...

956
00:53:01,551 --> 00:53:03,143
most of the men I meet
go out of their way...

957
00:53:03,186 --> 00:53:04,915
to show you
how sensitive they are.

958
00:53:04,955 --> 00:53:08,948
Before they were too macho,
and now they're too soft.

959
00:53:08,992 --> 00:53:10,960
You all want us to know
you can cry.

960
00:53:10,994 --> 00:53:14,020
No, with women,
I never cry. Never.

961
00:53:14,064 --> 00:53:15,554
I beg.

962
00:53:19,469 --> 00:53:21,437
If we finish
this bottle of wine...

963
00:53:21,471 --> 00:53:23,769
you won't have to beg.

964
00:53:40,757 --> 00:53:41,917
Diane!

965
00:53:43,827 --> 00:53:45,294
Oh, Philip.

966
00:53:45,329 --> 00:53:47,263
We were supposed
to go to dinner.

967
00:53:47,297 --> 00:53:49,060
I just had dinner!

968
00:53:49,099 --> 00:53:50,589
I don't believe this.

969
00:53:50,634 --> 00:53:54,764
Maybe it's a dream.
Good night, Philip.

970
00:53:55,839 --> 00:53:57,636
You do a good job.

971
00:53:57,674 --> 00:54:00,643
What do you charge
for big cars?

972
00:54:11,521 --> 00:54:14,820
I had a lot of fun, Thornton.

973
00:54:14,858 --> 00:54:17,986
Me, too.
And thanks for the lesson.

974
00:54:18,028 --> 00:54:19,495
I learned a lot.

975
00:54:19,529 --> 00:54:22,157
You're welcome. I did, too.

976
00:54:24,034 --> 00:54:25,262
Well...

977
00:54:26,403 --> 00:54:29,861
Well, I guess
this is good night.

978
00:54:29,906 --> 00:54:31,237
Yeah.

979
00:54:33,243 --> 00:54:35,370
A very good night.

980
00:54:42,152 --> 00:54:43,483
Beautiful.

981
00:54:45,389 --> 00:54:46,686
Oh, that's it.

982
00:54:46,723 --> 00:54:49,089
That's the spot.
Just keep doing that.

983
00:54:49,126 --> 00:54:52,095
Oh, don't lose it.

984
00:54:52,129 --> 00:54:54,324
Oh, Lou, you're great.

985
00:54:54,364 --> 00:54:57,265
The leg is better.
You got the cramp out.

986
00:54:57,300 --> 00:55:00,701
You're a wreck.
You gotta start working out.

987
00:55:00,737 --> 00:55:02,500
And you know what else?

988
00:55:02,539 --> 00:55:05,406
You have got midterms
coming up.

989
00:55:05,442 --> 00:55:08,070
You haven't studied five minutes
since you got here.

990
00:55:08,111 --> 00:55:09,271
You're always so neat.

991
00:55:09,312 --> 00:55:11,212
You're just like
your Uncle Vito.

992
00:55:11,248 --> 00:55:13,842
We were kids,
his room was always in order.

993
00:55:13,884 --> 00:55:15,044
His towels lined up neatly...

994
00:55:15,085 --> 00:55:17,246
combs, brushes, hair lotions
all in the right place.

995
00:55:17,287 --> 00:55:19,255
What did it mean?
What is he today?

996
00:55:19,289 --> 00:55:20,847
He's an attendant
in the men's room.

997
00:55:20,891 --> 00:55:23,291
Hey, he's my idol.

998
00:55:23,326 --> 00:55:28,559
But I'm not gonna be
folding towels anymore...

999
00:55:28,598 --> 00:55:31,761
'cause I just made...
ta da... the diving team.

1000
00:55:31,802 --> 00:55:34,430
That's great!

1001
00:55:34,471 --> 00:55:35,631
I'm takin' you out.

1002
00:55:35,672 --> 00:55:37,367
We'll celebrate.
We're havin' a party!

1003
00:55:37,407 --> 00:55:40,001
Oh, no, Dad, that's really nice,
but I'm in training now.

1004
00:55:40,043 --> 00:55:42,511
We got a big meet coming up
against Northern.

1005
00:55:42,546 --> 00:55:44,605
We'll have a party
after the meet.

1006
00:55:44,648 --> 00:55:48,584
Dad, why don't you join me
on a little reality break, OK?

1007
00:55:48,618 --> 00:55:50,984
Just 'cause you're in love
with Dr. Turner...

1008
00:55:51,021 --> 00:55:53,785
does not mean you're
gonna pass her course.

1009
00:55:53,824 --> 00:55:56,418
You got a major paper
coming up on Kurt Vonnegut.

1010
00:55:56,460 --> 00:55:58,257
You haven't even read
any of the books.

1011
00:55:58,295 --> 00:55:59,956
I tried.

1012
00:55:59,996 --> 00:56:03,159
I don't understand
a word of it.

1013
00:56:04,167 --> 00:56:07,159
So, how you gonna
write the paper, then?

1014
00:56:11,174 --> 00:56:14,439
Hi, I'm Kurt Vonnegut.
I'm looking for Thornton Melon.

1015
00:56:17,147 --> 00:56:19,775
Want to come in? Dad?

1016
00:56:22,819 --> 00:56:25,617
I don't want to hear
one more word out of you...

1017
00:56:25,655 --> 00:56:27,623
or it's back to the tree.

1018
00:56:27,657 --> 00:56:29,989
Come in.

1019
00:56:30,026 --> 00:56:33,018
Excuse me. Dr. Barazini?

1020
00:56:33,063 --> 00:56:34,428
I'm Thornton Melon.

1021
00:56:34,464 --> 00:56:37,991
Oh, yes, Thornton Melon.
I know you.

1022
00:56:38,034 --> 00:56:41,629
You delivered the paper
on isomagnetic brain waves...

1023
00:56:41,671 --> 00:56:43,229
in Montreal last year.

1024
00:56:43,273 --> 00:56:45,833
No, I sold you your pants.

1025
00:56:45,876 --> 00:56:47,935
Oh, of course.
Good to see you.

1026
00:56:47,978 --> 00:56:49,502
What are you doing here?

1027
00:56:49,546 --> 00:56:51,912
I'm supposed to report here
for my lab project.

1028
00:56:51,948 --> 00:56:54,781
Oh, good. I'm trying to teach
these here apes...

1029
00:56:54,818 --> 00:56:56,649
how to read and write.

1030
00:56:56,686 --> 00:56:59,484
You ought to teach them
how to go to the bathroom.

1031
00:56:59,523 --> 00:57:01,582
You'll get used to that.

1032
00:57:01,625 --> 00:57:06,392
Now, all you have to do
is put a new tape...

1033
00:57:06,429 --> 00:57:10,058
in the tape machine every hour
and observe the animals.

1034
00:57:10,100 --> 00:57:12,261
I'll be back in a few hours
to check on you.

1035
00:57:12,302 --> 00:57:14,862
- OK, fine.
- All righty.

1036
00:57:16,706 --> 00:57:20,039
You don't need this.
I'll find you an organ grinder.

1037
00:57:29,986 --> 00:57:32,147
Hiya, Marge?
A few things.

1038
00:57:32,188 --> 00:57:34,850
I need you and the gang to get
down here as fast as you can.

1039
00:57:34,891 --> 00:57:36,518
And I have to talk to Peterson,
the accountant.

1040
00:57:36,560 --> 00:57:37,925
I'm gonna need him, too.

1041
00:57:37,961 --> 00:57:41,260
Oh, thanks.
And, Marge, I need...

1042
00:57:44,200 --> 00:57:46,498
See if you can get somebody
at the Rand Corporation...

1043
00:57:46,536 --> 00:57:49,403
or the Brookings Institute to
come down here for about a week.

1044
00:57:51,975 --> 00:57:53,169
What?

1045
00:57:55,045 --> 00:57:58,037
And Russell hits him
with a powerful front body slam!

1046
00:58:03,019 --> 00:58:04,316
No problem.

1047
00:58:04,354 --> 00:58:06,754
They're takin' a break,
that's all.

1048
00:58:08,258 --> 00:58:12,490
In 1971, the United States
accumulated deficits...

1049
00:58:12,529 --> 00:58:15,464
greater than the supply
of gold the country held.

1050
00:58:15,498 --> 00:58:18,194
In that year, Richard Nixon...

1051
00:58:18,234 --> 00:58:21,169
took the United States
off the gold standard.

1052
00:58:21,204 --> 00:58:23,536
In doing so, he disrupted...

1053
00:58:26,242 --> 00:58:29,177
the entire international
monetary system.

1054
00:58:29,212 --> 00:58:31,942
What is that clicking noise?

1055
00:58:37,053 --> 00:58:39,112
Are you a student
in this class?

1056
00:58:40,957 --> 00:58:42,356
No.

1057
00:58:42,392 --> 00:58:44,917
Who are you?

1058
00:58:44,961 --> 00:58:48,226
I'm Marge Sweetwater...

1059
00:58:48,264 --> 00:58:50,562
Mr. Thornton Melon's
private secretary.

1060
00:58:57,607 --> 00:59:00,599
What are you doing here?

1061
00:59:00,644 --> 00:59:04,045
I'm taking notes for Mr. Melon.

1062
00:59:07,784 --> 00:59:12,016
He told you to write down
everything I say?

1063
00:59:12,055 --> 00:59:14,785
Yes, he did.

1064
00:59:14,824 --> 00:59:16,257
Good.

1065
00:59:18,695 --> 00:59:20,993
Take this down.

1066
00:59:23,733 --> 00:59:27,100
Mr. Melon,
no matter what you do...

1067
00:59:28,672 --> 00:59:31,539
no matter what stunts
you pull...

1068
00:59:31,574 --> 00:59:34,702
no matter how hard you try...

1069
00:59:34,744 --> 00:59:39,204
you will never, ever
pass this course.

1070
00:59:42,152 --> 00:59:44,620
Make sure he gets that.

1071
00:59:47,691 --> 00:59:49,659
Yes, sir.

1072
00:59:49,693 --> 00:59:50,853
I'll tell you what.

1073
00:59:50,894 --> 00:59:53,124
It's for Barbay.
Make it an "A."

1074
00:59:53,163 --> 00:59:55,324
Where's the lab report
on psychology?

1075
00:59:55,365 --> 00:59:56,696
Here.

1076
00:59:58,702 --> 01:00:01,865
It's too light.
It feels like a "C."

1077
01:00:01,905 --> 01:00:05,170
Bulk it up and add a few
multicolored graphs.

1078
01:00:05,208 --> 01:00:07,836
- Yo, Dad.
- Jason, hold it, will ya?

1079
01:00:07,877 --> 01:00:10,573
Listen, everybody.
Let's see "As" across the board.

1080
01:00:10,613 --> 01:00:11,773
I'll tell you what...

1081
01:00:11,815 --> 01:00:14,215
a ten percent bonus
for every grade over "B."

1082
01:00:14,250 --> 01:00:18,812
And an A+ gets you a free trip
to Hawaii... off-season.

1083
01:00:20,356 --> 01:00:24,190
- Dad, what's going on here?
- I'm doing my homework.

1084
01:00:24,227 --> 01:00:26,422
No, they're doing
your homework.

1085
01:00:26,463 --> 01:00:29,398
A good executive knows how
to delegate authority.

1086
01:00:29,432 --> 01:00:32,026
I took care of you, too.

1087
01:00:32,068 --> 01:00:35,834
- And what's this?
- Your astronomy report.

1088
01:00:35,872 --> 01:00:38,363
- What's wrong with you?
- What's wrong with you?

1089
01:00:38,408 --> 01:00:40,774
I want to write that paper.
I'm gonna write that paper.

1090
01:00:40,810 --> 01:00:43,301
That's why I'm taking astronomy,
to learn something!

1091
01:00:43,346 --> 01:00:45,314
You're never gonna learn
a goddamn thing...

1092
01:00:45,348 --> 01:00:47,373
if you got people
doing your work for you!

1093
01:00:47,417 --> 01:00:49,317
Oh, never mind.

1094
01:00:50,720 --> 01:00:55,350
Kids... they always do things
the hard way.

1095
01:00:55,391 --> 01:00:59,259
Ladies and gentlemen,
the visiting team...

1096
01:00:59,295 --> 01:01:02,594
the Northern University
Wildcats!

1097
01:01:04,067 --> 01:01:08,561
And your Grand Lakes
University Hooters!

1098
01:01:08,605 --> 01:01:11,369
- Hey, there's your boy!
- Jason!

1099
01:01:15,445 --> 01:01:18,573
While the teams are warming up,
we'd like to remind you...

1100
01:01:18,615 --> 01:01:20,674
that all proceeds
from the refreshment stands...

1101
01:01:20,717 --> 01:01:22,412
go to your student government.

1102
01:01:22,452 --> 01:01:25,421
Hey, Valerie. How you doin'?

1103
01:01:25,455 --> 01:01:27,548
Glad you could come. Listen.

1104
01:01:27,590 --> 01:01:30,525
My dad is having a party
tonight at the dorm...

1105
01:01:30,560 --> 01:01:33,461
and it should be pretty great.
His parties usually are.

1106
01:01:33,496 --> 01:01:38,195
I'd love to come,
except for I have a date.

1107
01:01:38,234 --> 01:01:41,692
Oh. Well, hey, bring him along.

1108
01:01:41,738 --> 01:01:44,229
It's OK.
You just both come by.

1109
01:01:44,274 --> 01:01:46,139
I'll really try.

1110
01:01:46,176 --> 01:01:48,144
Good. I hope
I'll see you there.

1111
01:01:48,178 --> 01:01:51,272
It sounds like fun. I wish
my dad were more like yours.

1112
01:02:01,958 --> 01:02:04,586
Hey, Chas.

1113
01:02:04,627 --> 01:02:06,390
Good luck, buddy.
Let's get them.

1114
01:02:06,429 --> 01:02:10,024
Yeah. Thanks, Melon.
I'd wish you luck, too...

1115
01:02:10,066 --> 01:02:12,091
but I guess a guy like you
doesn't need luck.

1116
01:02:13,102 --> 01:02:15,093
What's that supposed to mean?

1117
01:02:15,138 --> 01:02:17,197
With your old man behind you...

1118
01:02:17,240 --> 01:02:19,765
I figured since he bought
your way onto the team...

1119
01:02:19,809 --> 01:02:22,277
he probably bought off
the judges, too.

1120
01:02:26,349 --> 01:02:28,977
Oh, there's Thornton.

1121
01:02:29,018 --> 01:02:31,111
Diane!

1122
01:02:32,722 --> 01:02:36,180
I can't imagine what you can
possibly see in that man.

1123
01:02:36,226 --> 01:02:39,457
Philip, would you excuse me
for a minute?

1124
01:02:43,333 --> 01:02:45,358
Yes, yes.

1125
01:02:45,401 --> 01:02:47,426
- You look great.
- Oh, thanks.

1126
01:02:47,470 --> 01:02:49,267
Where you been?
I called you a hundred times.

1127
01:02:49,305 --> 01:02:51,273
I made four dates
with your answering machine.

1128
01:02:51,307 --> 01:02:53,298
I'm sorry I missed you.
Things have been so hectic.

1129
01:02:53,343 --> 01:02:56,176
I've been reading midterm papers
and grading exams.

1130
01:02:56,212 --> 01:02:57,440
Did you read mine yet?

1131
01:02:57,480 --> 01:02:59,345
Not yet,
but I'm looking forward to it.

1132
01:02:59,382 --> 01:03:01,247
I'm throwing a party
in our room tonight...

1133
01:03:01,284 --> 01:03:02,774
and you better be there.

1134
01:03:02,819 --> 01:03:05,811
I'm sorry. I have a date
with Philip tonight.

1135
01:03:05,855 --> 01:03:09,518
Bring him along.
We may run out of ice.

1136
01:03:12,228 --> 01:03:16,324
First diver
for Grand Lakes University...

1137
01:03:16,366 --> 01:03:18,630
Chas Osbourne.

1138
01:03:41,791 --> 01:03:45,420
Hey, Coach! How are ya?
How you doin', huh?

1139
01:03:50,066 --> 01:03:55,299
Next diver for Grand Lakes...
Jason Melon.

1140
01:03:55,338 --> 01:03:57,636
Melon.

1141
01:04:42,885 --> 01:04:43,977
What's going on?

1142
01:04:44,020 --> 01:04:45,749
This is always
the best party of the year.

1143
01:04:45,788 --> 01:04:48,416
I don't know.
Some big event at the dorms.

1144
01:04:48,458 --> 01:04:52,019
- We're thinkin' of going over.
- To Melon's? Are you nuts?

1145
01:04:52,061 --> 01:04:53,528
Why don't we go?

1146
01:04:53,563 --> 01:04:55,394
Valerie, please.
It'll be horrible.

1147
01:04:55,431 --> 01:04:58,127
Jason said it would be great.
It might be fun.

1148
01:04:58,167 --> 01:05:01,466
Jason's a twerp. We could have
won if it weren't for him.

1149
01:05:01,504 --> 01:05:04,166
Haven't you ever messed up?

1150
01:05:04,207 --> 01:05:05,401
No.

1151
01:05:10,413 --> 01:05:15,043
I'm all dressed up
with nowhere to go

1152
01:05:15,084 --> 01:05:16,813
Hey, baby!

1153
01:05:16,853 --> 01:05:20,084
Walking with a dead man
over my shoulder

1154
01:05:22,859 --> 01:05:25,657
I'm all dressed up
with nowhere to go

1155
01:05:27,997 --> 01:05:30,261
I love three girls at once.

1156
01:05:30,299 --> 01:05:33,359
If I fall asleep,
they have each other to talk to.

1157
01:05:41,044 --> 01:05:43,342
Nice look.
What are you going for?

1158
01:05:43,379 --> 01:05:45,745
The heavy, disassociated
artist thing...

1159
01:05:45,782 --> 01:05:49,548
or the "I'm going blind" thing?

1160
01:05:49,585 --> 01:05:53,521
Oh, It's the deaf thing.
Maybe this will cheer you up.

1161
01:05:53,556 --> 01:05:55,956
Oh, do me!

1162
01:05:55,992 --> 01:05:57,653
Derek! Get up, will ya?

1163
01:05:57,693 --> 01:06:00,856
You look like the poster boy
for birth control.

1164
01:06:04,567 --> 01:06:07,035
Jason, it's a party.
What's your story?

1165
01:06:07,070 --> 01:06:09,038
What's the matter?
The swim meet?

1166
01:06:09,072 --> 01:06:13,031
Forget about it. It's history.

1167
01:06:13,076 --> 01:06:15,442
Come on, will ya? Snap into it!

1168
01:06:15,478 --> 01:06:17,810
You're right, Dad.
It doesn't matter, Dad!

1169
01:06:17,847 --> 01:06:19,940
Right, Dad?
Come on, party, right?

1170
01:06:27,423 --> 01:06:29,618
Hey, buddy!

1171
01:06:29,659 --> 01:06:31,991
Everybody, make some noise,
have some fun!

1172
01:06:38,367 --> 01:06:40,164
What's that noise?

1173
01:06:40,203 --> 01:06:42,262
It's a party, Philip.
Midterms, remember?

1174
01:06:42,305 --> 01:06:44,796
They're just blowing off steam.

1175
01:06:44,841 --> 01:06:46,069
You there.

1176
01:06:48,444 --> 01:06:49,741
What's going on here?

1177
01:06:49,779 --> 01:06:53,977
The Melon man is throwing
the greatest party of all time!

1178
01:06:54,016 --> 01:06:57,110
The whole world is there.
It's the best thing...

1179
01:06:57,153 --> 01:06:59,451
that's ever happened to me
in my whole life!

1180
01:06:59,489 --> 01:07:01,787
Oh, God.

1181
01:07:06,162 --> 01:07:08,221
Look at that!

1182
01:07:08,264 --> 01:07:09,424
Listen to that racket.

1183
01:07:09,465 --> 01:07:11,729
This is disgraceful.
I should phone security.

1184
01:07:11,767 --> 01:07:13,428
Oh, Philip.

1185
01:07:18,341 --> 01:07:21,538
Good. Apparently I'm not
the only one around here...

1186
01:07:21,577 --> 01:07:23,135
with a sense of decency.

1187
01:07:29,418 --> 01:07:31,215
Yeah. Cool!

1188
01:07:35,057 --> 01:07:37,491
Did you see...
where are you going?

1189
01:07:37,527 --> 01:07:39,495
Intellectual curiosity, Philip.

1190
01:07:39,529 --> 01:07:40,894
Sounds fun in there.
Come with me.

1191
01:07:40,930 --> 01:07:43,831
- Oh, please!
- Oh, Philip!

1192
01:07:47,703 --> 01:07:50,263
It's a dead man's party

1193
01:07:50,306 --> 01:07:52,467
Who could ask for more

1194
01:07:53,543 --> 01:07:55,477
Everybody's coming

1195
01:07:55,511 --> 01:07:58,412
Leave your body
at the door

1196
01:07:58,447 --> 01:08:02,247
Leave your body and soul
at the door

1197
01:08:03,252 --> 01:08:05,777
Don't run away

1198
01:08:05,821 --> 01:08:08,585
It's only me

1199
01:08:15,498 --> 01:08:17,659
Don't run away

1200
01:08:17,700 --> 01:08:20,999
It's only me, only me

1201
01:08:21,037 --> 01:08:24,302
Don't be afraid

1202
01:08:24,340 --> 01:08:28,800
Of what you can't see

1203
01:08:28,844 --> 01:08:31,005
Say when.

1204
01:08:31,047 --> 01:08:33,641
Right after this drink.

1205
01:08:33,683 --> 01:08:36,049
Hey, what's a bath
without Bubbles?

1206
01:08:36,085 --> 01:08:38,747
Hey, Bubbles,
come over here, will ya?

1207
01:08:41,057 --> 01:08:43,651
Well!

1208
01:08:43,693 --> 01:08:45,923
- Hi there.
- Hi!

1209
01:08:45,962 --> 01:08:48,123
- What's your favorite subject?
- Poetry.

1210
01:08:48,164 --> 01:08:52,157
Really? Maybe you can help me
straighten out my Longfellow.

1211
01:08:55,905 --> 01:08:57,964
Excuse me.
Have you seen Thornton Melon?

1212
01:08:58,007 --> 01:08:59,770
I think he's in there.

1213
01:08:59,809 --> 01:09:00,969
Thanks.

1214
01:09:07,450 --> 01:09:10,317
Excuse me.
Has anyone seen Thornton Melon?

1215
01:09:11,487 --> 01:09:14,081
That's what I call
marine biology.

1216
01:09:14,123 --> 01:09:15,522
Diane!

1217
01:09:17,226 --> 01:09:19,387
Say hello to my nieces.

1218
01:09:20,963 --> 01:09:22,362
Wait a minute!

1219
01:09:27,036 --> 01:09:31,473
Jason? There you are.
I was looking all over for you.

1220
01:09:31,507 --> 01:09:35,568
Jason, are you OK?
I'm sorry about the swim meet.

1221
01:09:35,611 --> 01:09:38,808
Shit. Swim meet.

1222
01:09:38,848 --> 01:09:41,578
Jesus, you think I care
about the swim meet?

1223
01:09:41,617 --> 01:09:43,482
I mean, it's just
a stupid college game.

1224
01:09:43,519 --> 01:09:44,850
It's just bullshit.

1225
01:09:44,887 --> 01:09:46,821
Why are you acting like this?

1226
01:09:46,856 --> 01:09:48,847
I know you don't think
like that.

1227
01:09:48,891 --> 01:09:51,257
Oh, you do?

1228
01:09:51,294 --> 01:09:54,354
Grow up, Valerie.
You think this is real?

1229
01:09:54,397 --> 01:09:57,491
This isn't real.
College is a dream world.

1230
01:09:57,533 --> 01:09:59,262
This is something you do
to pass the time...

1231
01:09:59,302 --> 01:10:01,827
till you go out in the real
world and start buying people.

1232
01:10:01,871 --> 01:10:04,533
Let's go for a walk
and talk this out.

1233
01:10:04,573 --> 01:10:06,666
There you are.

1234
01:10:06,709 --> 01:10:08,700
Can we go? I'm bored.

1235
01:10:08,744 --> 01:10:09,972
Oh, Christ, Osbourne...

1236
01:10:10,012 --> 01:10:12,207
will you just get
your ass outta here?

1237
01:10:12,248 --> 01:10:14,273
What a surprise.
Another shit-faced Melon.

1238
01:10:14,317 --> 01:10:16,478
Do I gotta knock your teeth
down your throat?

1239
01:10:16,519 --> 01:10:19,420
Easy. Your father isn't here
to back you up this time.

1240
01:10:21,424 --> 01:10:22,891
Don't!

1241
01:10:27,263 --> 01:10:28,560
Are you OK?

1242
01:10:28,597 --> 01:10:32,294
Jason! I was lookin' for ya.

1243
01:10:32,335 --> 01:10:35,304
Hey, come here. Where ya goin'?

1244
01:10:35,338 --> 01:10:37,806
Where am I going?

1245
01:10:37,840 --> 01:10:40,536
I'm leaving school, Dad.
One of us has gotta go.

1246
01:10:40,576 --> 01:10:42,771
You're having such a great time.
I'm getting out.

1247
01:10:42,812 --> 01:10:44,279
Why? I don't get it.

1248
01:10:44,313 --> 01:10:46,008
Because you didn't win
the diving meet?

1249
01:10:46,048 --> 01:10:47,811
No, not because I didn't win!

1250
01:10:47,850 --> 01:10:49,545
Because I shouldn't
even have been there.

1251
01:10:49,585 --> 01:10:51,075
Chas told me
you bribed the coach...

1252
01:10:51,120 --> 01:10:52,587
to put me on the team.
Real good!

1253
01:10:52,621 --> 01:10:55,852
What? And you believed him.
I never lied to you in my life.

1254
01:10:55,891 --> 01:10:57,153
I didn't bribe the coach.

1255
01:10:57,193 --> 01:10:58,922
You were on the team
because you deserve it.

1256
01:10:58,961 --> 01:11:00,690
You made it on your own.

1257
01:11:00,730 --> 01:11:02,527
Dad, you don't get it.

1258
01:11:02,565 --> 01:11:04,123
Everything I have
is because of you...

1259
01:11:04,166 --> 01:11:05,326
and because of you...

1260
01:11:05,368 --> 01:11:09,065
I get my astronomy homework
done for me by NASA.

1261
01:11:09,105 --> 01:11:12,131
I just want the best for you.
That's all I ever wanted.

1262
01:11:14,710 --> 01:11:16,371
I did it all for you.

1263
01:11:17,847 --> 01:11:20,372
I know, but you don't know
when to quit.

1264
01:11:20,416 --> 01:11:24,284
I know you came here to help me,
and I really appreciate it...

1265
01:11:24,320 --> 01:11:27,118
and it's really sweet,
and it's really not working.

1266
01:11:27,156 --> 01:11:29,021
Can't you let me just do
something for myself?

1267
01:11:29,058 --> 01:11:31,151
I just want to see you happy.

1268
01:11:31,193 --> 01:11:33,821
Well, take a good look!

1269
01:11:33,863 --> 01:11:37,492
'Cause I was a lot happier
when I was miserable.

1270
01:11:49,111 --> 01:11:50,874
I enjoyed reading that, Susan.

1271
01:11:50,913 --> 01:11:52,210
It's a nice improvement.
Thank you.

1272
01:11:52,248 --> 01:11:54,773
Diane, why'd you fail me?

1273
01:11:54,817 --> 01:11:57,308
I didn't, Thornton.
You failed me.

1274
01:11:57,353 --> 01:12:00,811
- Is it because of last night?
- No. I can accept the fact...

1275
01:12:00,856 --> 01:12:02,824
that you're completely
regressed emotionally...

1276
01:12:02,858 --> 01:12:05,827
but you won't pass my course by
turning in someone else's work.

1277
01:12:05,861 --> 01:12:08,591
What do you think,
someone else wrote this?

1278
01:12:08,631 --> 01:12:11,065
All I know is that you didn't.
That's what disappoints me.

1279
01:12:11,100 --> 01:12:13,159
Whoever did write it...

1280
01:12:13,202 --> 01:12:15,830
doesn't know the first thing
about Kurt Vonnegut.

1281
01:12:15,871 --> 01:12:17,133
And another thing, Vonnegut.

1282
01:12:17,173 --> 01:12:19,573
I'm going to stop payment
on the check.

1283
01:12:19,608 --> 01:12:22,076
What's that? Fuck me?

1284
01:12:22,111 --> 01:12:25,740
Kurt, do you read lips?
Fuck you!

1285
01:12:25,781 --> 01:12:27,772
Next time
I'll call Robert Ludlum.

1286
01:12:31,754 --> 01:12:33,688
Derek, have you seen Jason?

1287
01:12:33,722 --> 01:12:36,691
I think he's on
a three-state killing spree.

1288
01:12:36,725 --> 01:12:38,522
Here's some more
potentially bad news.

1289
01:12:38,561 --> 01:12:41,428
Dean Martin wants to see you
in his office right away.

1290
01:12:41,464 --> 01:12:42,795
Dean Martin.

1291
01:12:44,800 --> 01:12:49,260
And she said, "Let's do it.
The room's already paid for."

1292
01:12:53,409 --> 01:12:57,072
Oh, golly.
I'm afraid we have...

1293
01:12:57,112 --> 01:13:00,980
a potentially unpleasant
situation on our hands here.

1294
01:13:01,016 --> 01:13:04,144
Phil, would you repeat
to Mr. Melon...

1295
01:13:04,186 --> 01:13:07,280
the allegations
that you've made to me?

1296
01:13:07,323 --> 01:13:10,292
It's clear the work you've
handed in is not your own.

1297
01:13:10,326 --> 01:13:12,726
I'm accusing you
of academic fraud.

1298
01:13:12,761 --> 01:13:16,492
Fraud is such an ugly word...

1299
01:13:16,532 --> 01:13:19,467
considering
the financial generosity...

1300
01:13:19,502 --> 01:13:22,494
that Mr. Melon has shown
towards our fine university.

1301
01:13:22,538 --> 01:13:25,234
I think Mr. Melon
should be expelled.

1302
01:13:26,876 --> 01:13:30,039
What are you going
to do about it?

1303
01:13:31,514 --> 01:13:33,641
Well, Thornton...

1304
01:13:33,682 --> 01:13:36,310
I'm only going
to ask you this one time.

1305
01:13:36,352 --> 01:13:39,913
Is the work that
you turned in your own?

1306
01:13:43,726 --> 01:13:46,251
I can't lie to you,
Dean Martin.

1307
01:13:48,831 --> 01:13:50,321
Yes, it is.

1308
01:13:50,366 --> 01:13:52,960
I'm satisfied.

1309
01:13:53,002 --> 01:13:55,163
- Phil?
- I'm outraged.

1310
01:13:55,204 --> 01:13:58,264
Gee whiz, Phil!
I just asked the man...

1311
01:13:58,307 --> 01:14:00,434
if the work was his,
and he said yes.

1312
01:14:00,476 --> 01:14:03,104
What do you want me to do,
torture him?

1313
01:14:04,547 --> 01:14:07,880
I suggest a comprehensive
oral examination...

1314
01:14:07,917 --> 01:14:10,317
conducted by all of
Mr. Melon's professors.

1315
01:14:10,352 --> 01:14:11,819
Oral examination?

1316
01:14:11,854 --> 01:14:15,381
Yes. If you've done the work
you say you have...

1317
01:14:15,424 --> 01:14:18,723
there should be no problem,
should there?

1318
01:14:20,596 --> 01:14:22,962
Hey, Jase.

1319
01:14:22,998 --> 01:14:25,558
Hey, Lou. How you doin'?

1320
01:14:25,601 --> 01:14:27,466
Come here.
I want to tell you something.

1321
01:14:27,503 --> 01:14:28,629
What?

1322
01:14:28,671 --> 01:14:30,901
You were pretty hard
on your father last night.

1323
01:14:30,940 --> 01:14:33,340
I know, but the guy
doesn't understand.

1324
01:14:33,375 --> 01:14:36,071
I know your pop thirty years.
He understands.

1325
01:14:36,111 --> 01:14:38,477
He's a nice guy,
and he's tough.

1326
01:14:38,514 --> 01:14:42,575
Like me.
I'm nice, and I'm tough.

1327
01:14:42,618 --> 01:14:45,143
I'll give you an idea
what I mean.

1328
01:14:45,187 --> 01:14:47,815
My two boys... I put one
through college...

1329
01:14:47,856 --> 01:14:49,687
and the other
I put through a wall.

1330
01:14:51,160 --> 01:14:53,151
Your papa loves you.

1331
01:14:54,430 --> 01:14:57,991
He's lookin' out for ya.
Look out for him.

1332
01:15:23,525 --> 01:15:24,822
What's goin' on?

1333
01:15:24,860 --> 01:15:27,624
I'm leavin'. I'm sorry, Jason.

1334
01:15:27,663 --> 01:15:30,894
This college thing
was a big mistake.

1335
01:15:30,933 --> 01:15:33,766
- So you're gonna give up?
- I can't win.

1336
01:15:33,802 --> 01:15:36,430
They want me to take oral exams
in all my subjects.

1337
01:15:36,472 --> 01:15:38,940
If I don't take them,
they'll kick me out.

1338
01:15:38,974 --> 01:15:41,534
And if I take 'em,
who knows where they'll kick me.

1339
01:15:44,313 --> 01:15:46,679
Hey, Dad, you remember
what you told me...

1340
01:15:46,715 --> 01:15:48,842
when I told you
I wanted to quit?

1341
01:15:48,884 --> 01:15:52,285
You told me that a man
without an education is nothing.

1342
01:15:52,321 --> 01:15:53,413
I can't do it.

1343
01:15:53,455 --> 01:15:54,945
You can do anything
you want to do.

1344
01:15:54,990 --> 01:15:58,118
You can do anything
you want in life.

1345
01:15:58,160 --> 01:16:00,128
Remember, you're a Melon.

1346
01:16:04,133 --> 01:16:06,931
Don't quit. I'll help you.

1347
01:17:33,422 --> 01:17:35,686
Before we begin...

1348
01:17:35,724 --> 01:17:39,216
I would just like to thank
each and every professor here...

1349
01:17:39,261 --> 01:17:44,198
for taking time out of
his/her extremely busy schedule.

1350
01:17:44,233 --> 01:17:47,327
And a special thanks, of course,
to Mr. Thornton Melon...

1351
01:17:47,369 --> 01:17:50,463
who I don't have to remind
anyone is the donor...

1352
01:17:50,506 --> 01:17:53,407
of our new
Melon School of Business.

1353
01:18:01,784 --> 01:18:03,752
We're wasting time.

1354
01:18:03,786 --> 01:18:06,414
Sorry, Phil.

1355
01:18:06,455 --> 01:18:09,754
Now, Mr. Melon,
you'll have three hours...

1356
01:18:09,792 --> 01:18:11,760
to complete the examination.

1357
01:18:11,794 --> 01:18:16,561
If you fail any part of it,
you will be expelled.

1358
01:18:16,598 --> 01:18:19,294
Mr. Melon, do you understand?

1359
01:18:21,170 --> 01:18:23,468
- The Council of Trent.
- Excuse me?

1360
01:18:23,505 --> 01:18:25,029
I missed the question.

1361
01:18:25,073 --> 01:18:26,904
We haven't begun yet.

1362
01:18:29,077 --> 01:18:32,103
Well, Dr. Barbay,
I suppose you're up first.

1363
01:18:46,595 --> 01:18:51,055
I have only one question
for Mr. Melon...

1364
01:18:55,504 --> 01:18:58,667
in 27 parts.

1365
01:19:01,343 --> 01:19:04,073
I'd like to break him
in 27 parts.

1366
01:19:04,112 --> 01:19:05,477
Excuse me?

1367
01:19:05,514 --> 01:19:06,879
No, nothin', nothin'.

1368
01:19:09,918 --> 01:19:13,285
Discuss the foundations of
modern global business systems.

1369
01:19:13,322 --> 01:19:16,086
Part one: Define
and differentiate...

1370
01:19:16,124 --> 01:19:18,092
the three economic
philosophies...

1371
01:19:18,126 --> 01:19:20,321
of capitalism, socialism
and communism...

1372
01:19:20,362 --> 01:19:23,889
as pertains to:
A... management fundamentals;

1373
01:19:23,932 --> 01:19:26,093
B... organizing and staffing;

1374
01:19:26,134 --> 01:19:28,125
C... labor management;

1375
01:19:28,170 --> 01:19:30,900
and D... production
and operations.

1376
01:19:30,939 --> 01:19:33,965
Part two...

1377
01:19:34,009 --> 01:19:36,978
Are you getting
all this, Mr. Melon?

1378
01:19:37,012 --> 01:19:39,776
Yeah. It's a piece o' cake.

1379
01:19:42,417 --> 01:19:44,851
Jason?

1380
01:19:49,858 --> 01:19:51,826
Valerie.

1381
01:19:51,860 --> 01:19:56,422
I wanted to apologize
for the other night...

1382
01:19:56,465 --> 01:20:00,868
my behavior
and the things I said.

1383
01:20:00,903 --> 01:20:02,495
And to thank you...

1384
01:20:02,537 --> 01:20:05,734
for your behavior
and the things you said.

1385
01:20:06,875 --> 01:20:10,402
I'm really sorry.

1386
01:20:10,445 --> 01:20:12,470
And I'm really
in love with you...

1387
01:20:12,514 --> 01:20:14,277
and I really have been
for a very long time.

1388
01:20:14,316 --> 01:20:17,444
And I can't believe
I'm saying this.

1389
01:20:17,486 --> 01:20:20,387
I don't want
to embarrass you...

1390
01:20:20,422 --> 01:20:23,755
or make you feel
uncomfortable with me...

1391
01:20:23,792 --> 01:20:26,317
but...

1392
01:20:26,361 --> 01:20:32,061
I've been needing to tell you
this for a very long time.

1393
01:20:34,836 --> 01:20:37,066
Are you aware that
that's the most...

1394
01:20:37,105 --> 01:20:39,630
you've ever said to me
at one time?

1395
01:20:39,675 --> 01:20:43,042
Except, of course, for the time
that you were ravingly drunk.

1396
01:20:44,780 --> 01:20:46,270
I love you, too.

1397
01:21:08,403 --> 01:21:12,134
In response
to Roman numeral 27...

1398
01:21:12,174 --> 01:21:15,143
section three, part two...

1399
01:21:15,177 --> 01:21:18,908
of subset D...
of the question...

1400
01:21:18,947 --> 01:21:21,347
the answer is...

1401
01:21:22,417 --> 01:21:24,078
Mr. Melon?

1402
01:21:31,793 --> 01:21:33,021
Mr. Melon?

1403
01:21:33,061 --> 01:21:36,895
Hey, relax. This man's been put
under a lot of pressure.

1404
01:21:36,932 --> 01:21:38,900
Let's take it easy on him.

1405
01:21:38,934 --> 01:21:41,095
Say it! Say it!

1406
01:21:42,571 --> 01:21:45,563
The answer is... four?

1407
01:21:52,781 --> 01:21:53,770
Right.

1408
01:22:00,822 --> 01:22:02,983
Dr. Turner?

1409
01:22:07,863 --> 01:22:10,331
Hold it. That's it.

1410
01:22:10,365 --> 01:22:11,957
I can't take it no more.

1411
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:16,630
I feel like I just gave birth
to an accountant.

1412
01:22:17,973 --> 01:22:19,463
Wait a minute, Thornton.

1413
01:22:31,386 --> 01:22:35,220
Thornton, do you remember
when we discussed...

1414
01:22:35,257 --> 01:22:36,815
the Dylan Thomas poem...

1415
01:22:36,858 --> 01:22:39,383
"Do Not Go Gentle
Into That Good Night"?

1416
01:22:39,428 --> 01:22:41,453
I don't know.

1417
01:22:41,496 --> 01:22:43,896
No. Maybe.

1418
01:22:43,932 --> 01:22:45,832
Thornton, think.

1419
01:22:45,867 --> 01:22:47,698
What's going on here?

1420
01:22:49,104 --> 01:22:52,562
Philip, relax. It's my turn.

1421
01:22:56,978 --> 01:22:58,343
Do you remember it?

1422
01:23:00,048 --> 01:23:03,211
"Do not go gentle into...

1423
01:23:03,251 --> 01:23:05,811
"into that good night.

1424
01:23:07,989 --> 01:23:10,719
"Old age should burn
and rage...

1425
01:23:10,759 --> 01:23:14,855
"at close of day.

1426
01:23:14,896 --> 01:23:18,229
"Rage, rage against
the dying of the light.

1427
01:23:18,266 --> 01:23:20,700
"Wild men who caught...

1428
01:23:20,735 --> 01:23:23,761
"and sang the sun in flight
and learned too late...

1429
01:23:23,805 --> 01:23:26,501
"they grieved it on its way.

1430
01:23:26,541 --> 01:23:30,102
"Do not go gentle
into that good night.

1431
01:23:30,145 --> 01:23:32,807
"Grave men near death...

1432
01:23:32,848 --> 01:23:35,316
"who see with blinding sight.

1433
01:23:35,350 --> 01:23:38,751
"Blind eyes could blaze
like meteors and be gay.

1434
01:23:38,787 --> 01:23:42,985
"Rage, rage against
the dying of the light.

1435
01:23:43,024 --> 01:23:47,757
"And you, my father,
there on the sad height.

1436
01:23:47,796 --> 01:23:49,821
"Curse, bless me now...

1437
01:23:49,865 --> 01:23:51,799
"with your fierce tears,
I pray.

1438
01:23:51,833 --> 01:23:55,200
"Do not go gentle
into that good night.

1439
01:23:55,237 --> 01:23:59,298
"Rage! Rage against
the dying of the light!"

1440
01:23:59,341 --> 01:24:02,139
Thornton, what does that poem
mean to you?

1441
01:24:02,177 --> 01:24:04,270
It means...

1442
01:24:04,312 --> 01:24:06,610
I don't take shit from no one.

1443
01:24:08,049 --> 01:24:10,040
I'm gonna pass this test.

1444
01:24:10,085 --> 01:24:13,646
I'm stayin' in school!
Who's next?

1445
01:24:16,691 --> 01:24:19,751
Now diving for
the Atlantic Eastern Eagles...

1446
01:24:19,794 --> 01:24:23,753
current conference champion...
Doug Nelson.

1447
01:24:23,798 --> 01:24:26,323
You know what you
almost never see?

1448
01:24:26,368 --> 01:24:29,496
Somebody heckling a diver.

1449
01:24:42,150 --> 01:24:45,142
- You're all right, kid.
- Thanks, Lou.

1450
01:24:45,187 --> 01:24:49,851
Please refrain from making
loud noises during the dives.

1451
01:24:52,027 --> 01:24:55,929
Next up, the Atlantic
Eastern Eagles'...

1452
01:24:55,964 --> 01:24:57,989
Bill Steincap.

1453
01:25:16,484 --> 01:25:20,477
That concludes Atlantic
Eastern's ten-meter dives.

1454
01:25:20,522 --> 01:25:23,320
Next up,
the Grand Lakes Hooters.

1455
01:25:26,261 --> 01:25:27,888
We would like to remind you...

1456
01:25:27,929 --> 01:25:30,193
tickets to all Grand Lakes
sporting events...

1457
01:25:30,232 --> 01:25:33,292
are available through
the student services office.

1458
01:25:33,335 --> 01:25:35,428
Are you interested
in Valerie Desmond?

1459
01:25:35,470 --> 01:25:38,064
She's with me.

1460
01:25:38,106 --> 01:25:40,836
Coming into your own,
are you, Melon?

1461
01:25:40,875 --> 01:25:42,342
I wouldn't break my arm...

1462
01:25:42,377 --> 01:25:44,607
patting myself on the back
if I were you.

1463
01:25:44,646 --> 01:25:46,637
Because... get this, towel boy...

1464
01:25:46,681 --> 01:25:49,809
no matter what you think,
you will always be a crude...

1465
01:25:49,851 --> 01:25:52,479
obnoxious, nouveau riche
little phlebe...

1466
01:25:52,520 --> 01:25:54,852
and you're gonna end up
just like your father.

1467
01:25:54,889 --> 01:25:58,848
God, I hope so,
'cause I happen to love the guy.

1468
01:25:58,893 --> 01:26:02,192
First up for
Grand Lakes University...

1469
01:26:02,230 --> 01:26:04,357
Chas Osbourne...

1470
01:26:04,399 --> 01:26:07,129
former national
high school champion.

1471
01:26:34,429 --> 01:26:37,421
- Jason dive yet?
- Not yet. Did you pass?

1472
01:26:37,465 --> 01:26:38,932
I don't know.
They'll let me know.

1473
01:26:38,967 --> 01:26:41,697
Now diving
for Grand Lakes University...

1474
01:26:41,736 --> 01:26:44,068
Jason Melon.

1475
01:27:03,792 --> 01:27:05,817
Attaboy, Jason! You did it!

1476
01:27:11,199 --> 01:27:12,223
All right!

1477
01:27:17,038 --> 01:27:19,506
I can't believe it.
We could actually win this.

1478
01:27:19,541 --> 01:27:23,500
Melon's dive has put the Hooters
back in this meet.

1479
01:27:24,979 --> 01:27:26,446
What's the matter?

1480
01:27:27,982 --> 01:27:29,950
You're up next, Chas.

1481
01:27:32,887 --> 01:27:34,980
I have got
a really bad cramp.

1482
01:27:35,023 --> 01:27:37,321
I've been having
really bad cramps all week.

1483
01:27:37,359 --> 01:27:40,624
- It's probably menstrual.
- Screw you, Melon!

1484
01:27:43,298 --> 01:27:47,257
Coach Turnbull,
you got another eligible diver?

1485
01:27:49,704 --> 01:27:51,171
Melon!

1486
01:27:54,542 --> 01:27:58,842
Melon! We need ya!
Get your suit on!

1487
01:27:58,880 --> 01:28:00,006
Go ahead.

1488
01:28:00,048 --> 01:28:02,175
Oh, not a chance.
In the shape I'm in...

1489
01:28:02,217 --> 01:28:04,310
you could donate my body
to science fiction.

1490
01:28:04,352 --> 01:28:06,718
Get your suit on! We need ya!

1491
01:28:06,755 --> 01:28:10,156
Come on, pal.
Show 'em what you got.

1492
01:28:10,191 --> 01:28:12,489
Melon! We need ya!

1493
01:28:17,432 --> 01:28:22,028
Now diving in substitution
for Grand Lakes University...

1494
01:28:22,070 --> 01:28:24,470
Thornton Melon.

1495
01:28:26,341 --> 01:28:28,571
He's on my substitute roster...

1496
01:28:28,610 --> 01:28:31,135
but I don't have it right now.

1497
01:28:31,179 --> 01:28:34,876
But what I'll do is,
first chance I get...

1498
01:28:34,916 --> 01:28:36,474
I'll bring it to you.

1499
01:28:54,869 --> 01:28:57,303
What dive is he gonna do?

1500
01:28:57,338 --> 01:29:00,273
The Triple Lindy.

1501
01:29:00,308 --> 01:29:02,538
Melon! Melon! Melon!

1502
01:29:09,284 --> 01:29:11,844
There will be an additional
springboard installed...

1503
01:29:11,886 --> 01:29:14,684
for Melon's dive,
the Triple Lindy.

1504
01:29:14,722 --> 01:29:17,282
- Is that hard?
- It's impossible.

1505
01:30:40,842 --> 01:30:43,333
Melon! You did it!

1506
01:30:48,249 --> 01:30:49,614
That was great!

1507
01:30:54,255 --> 01:30:58,214
Oh, you were great!
That was incredible!

1508
01:30:58,259 --> 01:31:00,727
I guess there's nothing
you can't do.

1509
01:31:00,762 --> 01:31:02,923
I've got the results
of your exams right here.

1510
01:31:02,964 --> 01:31:04,090
Do I want to hear 'em?

1511
01:31:04,132 --> 01:31:06,726
You passed!
All "Ds" and an "A."

1512
01:31:06,768 --> 01:31:08,793
Who gave me the "A"?

1513
01:31:08,836 --> 01:31:11,168
- I did.
- Oh, yeah?

1514
01:31:11,205 --> 01:31:13,799
I would like to introduce
our speaker today.

1515
01:31:13,841 --> 01:31:15,274
This is the first time...

1516
01:31:15,310 --> 01:31:18,711
in the history
of this fine institution...

1517
01:31:18,746 --> 01:31:21,579
that a freshman
has given this address.

1518
01:31:21,616 --> 01:31:24,210
Mr. Thornton Melon.

1519
01:31:37,198 --> 01:31:38,358
Thank you very much.

1520
01:31:38,399 --> 01:31:41,163
Thank you, Dean Martin,
President Sinclair...

1521
01:31:41,202 --> 01:31:43,670
and members
of the graduating class.

1522
01:31:43,705 --> 01:31:46,538
I have only one thing
to say to you today...

1523
01:31:46,574 --> 01:31:48,007
it's a jungle out there.

1524
01:31:48,042 --> 01:31:50,602
You gotta look out
for number one.

1525
01:31:50,645 --> 01:31:53,443
But don't step in number two.

1526
01:31:54,949 --> 01:31:57,975
And so,
to all you graduates...

1527
01:31:58,019 --> 01:32:02,115
as you go out into the world
my advice to you is...

1528
01:32:02,156 --> 01:32:05,125
don't go!
It's rough out there.

1529
01:32:05,159 --> 01:32:08,128
Move back with your parents.
Let them worry about it.
