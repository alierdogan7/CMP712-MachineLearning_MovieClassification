A note from Tornberry:
The subtitles (both streams) were timed and made
for the ENGLISH audio track, NOT the Japanese audio track.
This is why they appear early, late, and when no one's talking.
My suggestion is to watch this movie dubbed. Great voice-actors!
Thank you, Disney!

Gotta go.

Haru, we can see you sneaking in,

00:03:12,161 --> 00:03:14,925
It's not fair.
First I have a bad morning,

30
00:03:14,997 --> 00:03:17,158
then everyone laughs at me in class.

31
00:03:17,266 --> 00:03:20,861
- Even Machida was laughing, wasn't he?
- Yeah, pretty hard.

32
00:03:20,936 --> 00:03:25,305
Why me? Why are all these bad things
happening to me?

33
00:03:25,374 --> 00:03:28,901
Hm, maybe it's some kind
of weird omen, Haru.

34
00:03:29,044 --> 00:03:32,309
Like your life is
gonna get a whole lot worse real soon.

00:03:32,414 --> 00:03:34,473
Thanks. That helps a lot.

36
00:03:42,891 --> 00:03:44,654
That's odd. Never seen him.

37
00:03:47,496 --> 00:03:51,728
- Why worry about what Machida thinks?
- I just think he's so cool.

38
00:03:51,834 --> 00:03:54,701
- Tell him.
- What if he has a girlfriend?

39
00:03:54,803 --> 00:03:57,431
He does. A freshman. Really cute.

40
00:03:57,573 --> 00:03:59,734
Then why tell me to flirt with him?

41
00:03:59,842 --> 00:04:02,606
I want a good laugh
when he blows you off.

42
00:04:02,678 --> 00:04:05,374
- You are terrible.
- Machida's not that cool.

43
00:04:05,447 --> 00:04:08,348
- My Tsuge is much cooler and...
- Careful.

44
00:04:15,724 --> 00:04:19,091

- Cat burglar.

46

Hey, dumb cat! You'll get killed!

00:04:35,177 --> 00:04:39,136
- Oh well, it's just a cat.
- This doesn't look so good.

Haru, don't!

50
00:04:50,693 --> 00:04:52,160

you rescued that stupid cat.

63

- It talked.
- What?

when you were a little girl.

You said, "Mommy,
did you know I can talk to cats?"

- I said that?
- Yes. You don't remember?

- Mommy!

- What were you doing over there?
- I was talking with the kitten.

92
00:08:08,957 --> 00:08:11,619
So I asked you
what the kitten said to you.

93
00:08:11,693 --> 00:08:13,490
And do you know what you said?

94
00:08:13,562 --> 00:08:17,521

that life is tough.

you saved today was none other

than the king's only son Prince Lune.

00:16:31,059 --> 00:16:35,052
How can that be? The whole kingdom
is working to make you happy.

179
00:16:35,163 --> 00:16:38,098
And we all agreed
that the gifts were fabulous.

180
00:16:38,166 --> 00:16:41,101
Don't you cats know anything?
I hate mice.

181
00:16:41,236 --> 00:16:44,694
I'm allergic to cat tails
and catnip does nothing for me.

182
00:16:44,806 --> 00:16:47,172
Oh, my my my my my.

183
00:16:47,242 --> 00:16:49,676
I guess we made a little mistake.

184
00:16:49,744 --> 00:16:52,144
Well, this is embarrassing.

185
00:16:52,213 --> 00:16:55,341
The king will not be happy
when he hears about this.

186
00:16:55,417 --> 00:16:57,908
I'm sorry. Did I hurt your feelings?

187
00:16:58,019 --> 00:17:00,647
I overreacted, didn't I?

188
00:17:00,789 --> 00:17:06,022
[Sighs] I've just been on edge recently.
Things have not been going well for me.

189
00:17:06,094 --> 00:17:10,622
- What kind of things?
- I don't know. Everything, you name it.

190
00:17:10,698 --> 00:17:12,393
I'm shocked to hear this.

191
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:17,062
But I suppose even pretty girls like you
have problems like everyone else.

192
00:17:17,172 --> 00:17:21,939
- What? Stop. That's enough.
- It is nowhere near enough.

193
00:17:22,010 --> 00:17:26,640
The Kingdom of Cats has vowed not to
rest until you are completely satisfied.

194
00:17:26,748 --> 00:17:29,945
- There's more?
- Yes.

195
00:17:30,018 --> 00:17:34,614
How would you like to have a private
tour of the spectacular Kingdom of Cats?

196
00:17:34,722 --> 00:17:36,417
Are you serious?

197
00:17:36,524 --> 00:17:39,652
I'm sure you'll love it there.
It's a marvelous place.

198
00:17:39,761 --> 00:17:41,752
Great food, fabulous scenery

199
00:17:41,863 --> 00:17:46,960
and the entire cat kingdom
is ready to welcome you.

200
00:17:47,035 --> 00:17:50,937
And that's not all.
The king is so taken with you,

201
00:17:51,005 --> 00:17:54,771
he has awarded you the most
valuable gift in the cat kingdom.

202
00:17:54,876 --> 00:17:58,972
You will become his daughter-in-law
and marry Prince Lune.

203
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:00,843
Huh?

204
00:18:00,949 --> 00:18:03,816
Don't think
about trying to pull that one on me.

205
00:18:03,918 --> 00:18:06,352
There is no way I can marry a cat.

206
00:18:06,454 --> 00:18:09,685
The royal family
thinks you're good enough

207
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:12,555
and the prince is so cool.

208
00:18:13,394 --> 00:18:15,919
- He's cool?
- Hm-mm.

209
00:18:25,607 --> 00:18:26,631
Hmm...

210
00:18:26,708 --> 00:18:30,872
Who knows? Maybe I'd fit in better
with a bunch of cats.

211
00:18:31,946 --> 00:18:34,437
You get to lie around all day,
don't you?

212
00:18:34,549 --> 00:18:38,747
- But of course.
- Eat all the food you want,

213
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:43,348
take naps in the sun,
forget about all your problems.

214
00:18:43,424 --> 00:18:47,485
But me getting married to a cat prince,
that's just ridiculous.

215
00:18:47,595 --> 00:18:49,529
Right, cat?

216
00:18:49,631 --> 00:18:52,361
Fantastic.
We'll collect you tonight, then.

217
00:18:53,635 --> 00:18:56,160
No, I didn't agree to that.
Hey, wait!

218
00:18:58,439 --> 00:19:00,532
[Haru] Ow!

219
00:19:00,642 --> 00:19:02,701
Oh, I hurt.

220
00:19:03,378 --> 00:19:05,471
Okay, think, Haru.

221
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:08,173
You gotta do something about this.

222
00:19:08,416 --> 00:19:11,249
What can I do?
Those cats are relentless.

223
00:19:11,319 --> 00:19:15,312
They'll find a way to kidnap me
and I'll have to marry a cat.

224
00:19:15,390 --> 00:19:18,257
I now pronounce you cat and wife.

225
00:19:18,393 --> 00:19:20,452
You may kiss the bride.

226
00:19:21,129 --> 00:19:23,188
No, no, I don't want to marry a cat!

227
00:19:23,298 --> 00:19:25,357
[Cries]

228
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,059
<i>[Female voice] Haru. Haru.</i>

229
00:19:29,504 --> 00:19:30,903
What was that?

230
00:19:31,005 --> 00:19:34,668
<i>Haru, go to the Cat Bureau.</i>
<i>Find the Cat Bureau.</i>

231
00:19:36,344 --> 00:19:40,804
Hey, come on. Who's there?
Who's messing with me now?

232
00:19:40,882 --> 00:19:44,943
<i>They will help you there. Look for</i>
<i>a large, white cat at the crossroads.</i>

233
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:48,016
<i>He will show you the way.</i>

234
00:19:48,089 --> 00:19:50,182
A cat at a crossroad?

235
00:19:50,291 --> 00:19:53,886
<i>Find the white cat</i>
<i>and go to the Cat Bureau, Haru.</i>

236
00:19:54,028 --> 00:19:56,121
<i>You'll need their help.</i>

237
00:20:12,747 --> 00:20:14,715
[Haru] Find the Cat Bureau.

238
00:20:16,884 --> 00:20:18,749
Never heard of a Cat Bureau.

239
00:20:20,421 --> 00:20:22,889
Look for a large, white cat...

240
00:20:24,359 --> 00:20:28,955
At least it was a pleasant voice.
Maybe the white cat will be nice, too.

241
00:20:30,164 --> 00:20:34,430
That was one long, weird day.
I definitely need a break.

242
00:20:34,535 --> 00:20:36,435
- [Groans]
- [Screams]

243
00:20:37,538 --> 00:20:39,597
What in the heck was that?

244
00:20:40,942 --> 00:20:44,878
Hey, you big fatso.
You cats keep freaking me out.

245
00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:48,378
Are you the big, white cat? Are you?

246
00:20:49,751 --> 00:20:53,278
Listen, cat.
I need to know where the Cat Bureau is.

247
00:20:56,357 --> 00:20:58,291
A voice told me to ask you.

248
00:21:03,998 --> 00:21:08,025
Must have the wrong person.
I mean cat. I have the wrong cat.

249
00:21:08,136 --> 00:21:10,036
Sorry I sat on you.

250
00:21:11,706 --> 00:21:14,300
- Wait. I'll show you.
- It's him!

251
00:21:16,978 --> 00:21:19,105
Wait a minute. Slow down.

252
00:21:43,204 --> 00:21:45,729
Isn't there an easier way?

253
00:21:47,241 --> 00:21:49,368
Hey. Hey, come on.

254
00:21:49,477 --> 00:21:52,412
Guess I shouldn't have called him Fatso.

255
00:22:04,625 --> 00:22:06,684
[Sighs]

256
00:22:42,864 --> 00:22:44,923
Huh?

257
00:22:57,311 --> 00:22:59,404
Oh...

258
00:23:14,128 --> 00:23:16,221
Wow, this is one weird place.

259
00:23:42,023 --> 00:23:44,218
Excuse me, where's the Cat Bureau?

260
00:23:47,628 --> 00:23:50,961
Hello?
I need some help right now.

261
00:23:51,032 --> 00:23:53,967
I'm gonna get dragged off
to the cat kingdom.

262
00:24:05,379 --> 00:24:06,403
[Gasps]

263
00:24:09,851 --> 00:24:12,081
Could this be it?

264
00:24:32,106 --> 00:24:34,199
Enough, Baron. Turn it off.

265
00:24:34,342 --> 00:24:37,334
No one's impressed
with your cheesy light show, okay?

266
00:25:02,970 --> 00:25:05,438
Good evening. Welcome to the Bureau

267
00:25:08,843 --> 00:25:10,936
Wow, you're cool.

268
00:25:11,012 --> 00:25:15,142
Thank you. You're now in a world
quite different from your own.

269
00:25:15,249 --> 00:25:17,444
This is a refuge for creations.

270
00:25:17,518 --> 00:25:21,147
Whenever someone creates something
with all of their heart,

271
00:25:21,222 --> 00:25:24,089
then that creation is given a soul.

272
00:25:24,158 --> 00:25:26,592
Like me and Toto there.

273
00:25:38,406 --> 00:25:39,634
That's... That's...

274
00:25:39,707 --> 00:25:42,801
That is Toto.
A stone statue with a soul.

275
00:25:42,877 --> 00:25:46,176
I see you have a visitor today, Baron.
How unusual.

276
00:25:46,247 --> 00:25:48,943
Indeed. She's quite a fetching one, too.

277
00:25:49,050 --> 00:25:51,416
Did he say Baron?

278
00:25:51,485 --> 00:25:53,953
I am Baron Humbert von Gikkingen.

279
00:25:54,088 --> 00:25:57,057
The artisan who created me
gave me that title.

280
00:25:57,124 --> 00:25:59,058
I'll just call you Baron.

281
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:04,598
So, you say you're having trouble
with those cats from the cat kingdom.

282
00:26:04,699 --> 00:26:08,533
Yes. Yesterday I saved their prince
from getting hit by a truck,

283
00:26:08,603 --> 00:26:11,401
and now they won't stop
trying to repay me.

284
00:26:11,505 --> 00:26:13,234
- I see.
- Huh!

285
00:26:13,307 --> 00:26:17,607
Serves you right. Thought you'd help
the poor kitty, did you?

286
00:26:19,914 --> 00:26:22,712
You should've minded your own business.

287
00:26:22,817 --> 00:26:24,944
[Toto] Muta, what's your problem?

288
00:26:25,052 --> 00:26:28,783
This girl saved one of your own kind.
You should be grateful.

289
00:26:28,889 --> 00:26:32,086
Now she's in trouble for it, isn't she?

290
00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:35,287
So she was stupid,
that's all I'm saying.

291
00:26:36,797 --> 00:26:38,788
Where did you find her, Muta?

292
00:26:38,899 --> 00:26:42,562
At the crossroads.
She knew about the Cat Bureau.

293
00:26:42,637 --> 00:26:44,298
Hmm.

294
00:26:44,405 --> 00:26:48,933
A voice told me about it. I don't know
whose voice it was, though.

295
00:26:49,043 --> 00:26:51,068
- A voice?
- You're hearing voices?

296
00:26:51,178 --> 00:26:54,341
Check into a loony bin.
Don't bother us with...

297
00:26:55,216 --> 00:26:58,583
- Knock it off!
- You knock it off. Quit being so catty.

298
00:26:58,686 --> 00:27:00,210
Don't try that again.

299
00:27:00,287 --> 00:27:03,814
You guys, I'll just leave.
I don't want to cause any trouble.

300
00:27:03,924 --> 00:27:05,755
I didn't get your name.

301
00:27:05,860 --> 00:27:08,488
Haru. It's Haru.

302
00:27:08,596 --> 00:27:11,190
Well, Miss Haru,
please step into the Bureau.

303
00:27:12,833 --> 00:27:15,961
- Come along. Don't worry about them.
- Chicken wings!

304
00:27:16,037 --> 00:27:19,495
Can't you tell the difference
between chickens and crows?

305
00:27:19,607 --> 00:27:24,374
- Yes, I'm not the birdbrain here.
- I don't look like a giant marshmallow.

306
00:27:24,512 --> 00:27:27,948
- At least I don't have a bird brain.
- You already said that.

307
00:27:28,049 --> 00:27:33,146
- Go fry yourself, you big chicken.
- You already called me a chicken!

308
00:27:37,191 --> 00:27:39,284
This looks close.

309
00:27:40,795 --> 00:27:44,060
Wow, this place is beautiful.

310
00:27:44,131 --> 00:27:47,259
- Make yourself at home.
- Thanks.

311
00:27:48,869 --> 00:27:50,837
Milk with your tea, or lemon?

312
00:27:50,938 --> 00:27:53,031
- Milk, please.
- Good choice.

313
00:28:01,148 --> 00:28:03,844
You have great taste, Baron.

314
00:28:03,951 --> 00:28:06,181
- Here you are.
- Thank you.

315
00:28:09,390 --> 00:28:10,721
How cute.

316
00:28:10,791 --> 00:28:13,589
That's my own personal blend of tea.

317
00:28:13,661 --> 00:28:17,927
It's a little different each time,
so I can't guarantee the taste.

318
00:28:19,467 --> 00:28:21,901
Wow, that's the best tea
I've ever tasted.

319
00:28:22,002 --> 00:28:23,526
Then you're lucky.

320
00:28:23,637 --> 00:28:26,834
Just tastes like boiled grass to me.

321
00:28:28,309 --> 00:28:31,005
Tea is too refined
for your crude taste buds.

322
00:28:31,078 --> 00:28:32,978
At least I don't eat worms.

323
00:28:33,047 --> 00:28:38,713
Muta, have a seat and tell us
what you know about the Kingdom of Cats.

324
00:28:38,819 --> 00:28:40,878
It's a dangerous place.

325
00:28:40,988 --> 00:28:44,480
You shouldn't go there
if you don't believe in yourself.

326
00:28:44,558 --> 00:28:45,991
Good point.

327
00:28:46,060 --> 00:28:48,324
They said not only will they kidnap me,

328
00:28:48,429 --> 00:28:51,990
they're going to force me
to marry Prince Lune.

329
00:28:52,066 --> 00:28:54,398
So, do it. You'll be set for life.

330
00:28:54,502 --> 00:28:57,369
- Are you crazy?
- It might not be all that bad.

331
00:28:57,471 --> 00:28:58,995
That's ridiculous.

332
00:28:59,073 --> 00:29:03,032
- She won't know until she tries it.
- Now, then...

333
00:29:04,145 --> 00:29:08,445
I've always entertained the idea of
paying a visit to the Kingdom of Cats.

334
00:29:08,549 --> 00:29:11,518
- Now is the time.
- Have a nice trip.

335
00:29:11,585 --> 00:29:14,986
- Hope you make it back some day.
- You're coming with me.

336
00:29:15,089 --> 00:29:18,115
Nah, I'll pass.
But thanks for thinking of me.

337
00:29:18,225 --> 00:29:21,160
Baron, you're not going to
take her there, are you?

338
00:29:21,228 --> 00:29:23,253
We can't leave her unprotected.

339
00:29:23,364 --> 00:29:27,664
But if Muta wants to stay here,
he can keep an eye on her.

340
00:29:27,735 --> 00:29:31,671
No way. You can't leave her here.
I'm not baby-sitting.

341
00:29:31,739 --> 00:29:34,708
- Why? Are you busy at the moment?
- Not really.

342
00:29:34,809 --> 00:29:36,276
I'll just go home.

343
00:29:36,377 --> 00:29:38,868
- Hmm?
- What?

344
00:29:38,979 --> 00:29:42,540
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to
cause you so much trouble.

345
00:29:42,616 --> 00:29:47,246
Muta's right. It's my fault
for getting involved with those cats.

346
00:29:47,321 --> 00:29:49,721
I'll figure something out.

347
00:29:50,591 --> 00:29:55,085
Well, then, so sorry the Cat Bureau
couldn't be of any help to you.

348
00:29:56,931 --> 00:30:00,094
Ah... All right, all right.

349
00:30:01,235 --> 00:30:03,635
I'll watch the little baby.

350
00:30:03,737 --> 00:30:05,602
Good kitty.

351
00:30:05,706 --> 00:30:08,766
Then it's settled.
You can stay here with Muta.

352
00:30:08,843 --> 00:30:10,037
You sure?

353
00:30:10,110 --> 00:30:14,945
Don't worry about Muta. He complains
a lot but he has a heart of gold.

354
00:30:15,049 --> 00:30:16,038
Hmph!

355
00:30:16,617 --> 00:30:19,279
Hm... I see.

356
00:30:19,353 --> 00:30:21,446
So he's just a big softie.

357
00:30:21,555 --> 00:30:23,284
You could say that.

358
00:30:23,357 --> 00:30:25,416
And this is the thanks I get.

359
00:30:25,492 --> 00:30:29,019
Thank you for your help, Moo-ta.
[Gasps]

360
00:30:29,129 --> 00:30:32,792
What? Moo?
Are you saying that I'm a fat cow?

361
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:36,631
- No, you're just fat.
- I like this girl better every minute.

362
00:30:36,737 --> 00:30:38,136
I'm outta here.

363
00:30:38,239 --> 00:30:42,471
That's too bad. I was just going to
get out some angel fruit cake.

364
00:30:42,576 --> 00:30:45,909
- Where is it?
- It's in the upper-right shelf.

365
00:30:45,980 --> 00:30:47,777
Why didn't you say so?

366
00:30:47,848 --> 00:30:50,681
Our guest
deserves a proper afternoon tea.

367
00:30:51,785 --> 00:30:54,379
This calls
for some of my special mulberries.

368
00:30:57,892 --> 00:31:00,884
You're too much, Baron.
A tea party and everything?

369
00:31:01,028 --> 00:31:05,624
- Anything I can do to help?
- Yes, there is something.

370
00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:10,093
I need you to learn just one thing.
Always believe in yourself.

371
00:31:10,170 --> 00:31:14,573
Do this, and no matter where you are,
you will have nothing to fear.

372
00:31:15,709 --> 00:31:19,110
Baron, give me a hand
with this whipped cream.

373
00:31:19,179 --> 00:31:22,876
- You're going all out.
- Better believe it.

374
00:31:24,885 --> 00:31:27,547
Who knows?
Maybe this is the world I belong in.

375
00:31:27,655 --> 00:31:29,145
[Knock at door]

376
00:31:29,223 --> 00:31:31,316
Hey, is that Toto?

377
00:31:36,297 --> 00:31:39,528
It's time to go to our kingdom,
Miss Haru.

378
00:31:39,633 --> 00:31:44,434
You again!
No! Hey! Get away from me!

379
00:31:48,342 --> 00:31:50,401
Skip the tea.

380
00:31:51,145 --> 00:31:52,578
[Screams]

381
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:55,171
Don't let them take me away, please!

382
00:31:55,783 --> 00:31:59,014
Baron,
a bunch of cats are headed this way.

383
00:31:59,119 --> 00:32:01,019
- Oh no.
- A little late, birdbrain.

384
00:32:01,088 --> 00:32:03,852
Toto, give me a lift.

385
00:32:07,795 --> 00:32:09,456
Ouch!

386
00:32:10,130 --> 00:32:12,121
We had a hard time finding you.

387
00:32:12,199 --> 00:32:14,326
- Let me off.
- What?

388
00:32:14,401 --> 00:32:16,869
- [Shrieks]
- Careful, Miss Haru.

389
00:32:16,971 --> 00:32:19,804
Stop these cats.
I want off this thing now.

390
00:32:19,907 --> 00:32:24,207
Don't worry. You're just having
pre-wedding jitters, that's all.

391
00:32:24,311 --> 00:32:25,642
No, I'm not!

392
00:32:30,017 --> 00:32:32,577
She could've waited
until after we had cake.

393
00:32:32,686 --> 00:32:34,449
Ow! Quit that!

394
00:32:34,922 --> 00:32:37,117
Let me go. Stop it. It hurts.

395
00:32:37,858 --> 00:32:39,416
They're coming for me.

396
00:32:39,493 --> 00:32:43,190
- I said let me go.
- Okay, Toto. Now!

397
00:32:43,263 --> 00:32:45,163
Wait. I take it back!

398
00:32:48,168 --> 00:32:51,103
Why did you let him fall?
You cats are terrible.

399
00:32:51,205 --> 00:32:53,230
You're gonna regret that.

400
00:32:54,074 --> 00:32:55,302
Muta!

401
00:32:55,409 --> 00:32:57,604
We're over the weight limit.

402
00:33:00,514 --> 00:33:02,607
- Toto.
- I see it.

403
00:33:17,197 --> 00:33:19,358
[Haru screams]

404
00:33:20,834 --> 00:33:23,132
Let me off this thing!

405
00:33:28,742 --> 00:33:30,266
Outmaneuvered.

406
00:33:32,913 --> 00:33:35,040
- Get above the trees.
- Right.

407
00:33:45,159 --> 00:33:47,252
Now what?

408
00:33:51,932 --> 00:33:54,628
They're riding the wind.
Follow the lights.

409
00:33:54,735 --> 00:33:56,100
Got it.

410
00:34:06,180 --> 00:34:08,273
[Haru groans]

411
00:34:09,283 --> 00:34:11,342
Oh, that hurt.

412
00:34:11,418 --> 00:34:14,945
Where am I anyway?
I can't see a thing.

413
00:34:18,692 --> 00:34:20,626
[Gasps]

414
00:34:23,664 --> 00:34:26,565
Muta. What happened? You're enormous.

415
00:34:26,667 --> 00:34:29,500
No, kiddo. You got smaller.

416
00:34:29,603 --> 00:34:30,627
Hm?

417
00:34:31,905 --> 00:34:33,702
Why's that?

418
00:34:33,807 --> 00:34:35,866
Because we're here, that's why.

419
00:34:46,620 --> 00:34:49,418
That's the Kingdom of Cats?

420
00:35:07,341 --> 00:35:08,831
That's it.

421
00:35:27,594 --> 00:35:29,653
[Both meow]

422
00:35:32,699 --> 00:35:34,963
Wow, there are cats all over the place.

423
00:35:35,068 --> 00:35:38,435
What did you expect?
It is their kingdom.

424
00:35:38,505 --> 00:35:40,598
Hey, you!

425
00:35:48,081 --> 00:35:50,914
Ah, it's so relaxing here.

426
00:35:51,018 --> 00:35:53,987
Hey, we have to find
a way out of there fast.

427
00:35:54,087 --> 00:35:56,282
- Relax.
- Listen, kid...

428
00:35:56,356 --> 00:35:59,348
I've never felt so at home in my life.

429
00:35:59,426 --> 00:36:02,827
[Female] Hurry.
You've got to get out of here.

430
00:36:04,731 --> 00:36:07,996
You must leave.
You don't belong here.

431
00:36:08,068 --> 00:36:10,195
Wow! You're beautiful.

432
00:36:10,304 --> 00:36:12,704
Everything's better here.
Even the cats.

433
00:36:12,806 --> 00:36:17,402
Quickly. You don't have much time.
Please, Miss Haru, before it's too late.

434
00:36:17,477 --> 00:36:20,469
Wait a minute.
How do you know my name?

435
00:36:20,581 --> 00:36:22,674
Miss Haru! Miss Haru!

436
00:36:23,517 --> 00:36:26,543
- Huh?
- Oh, not him again.

437
00:36:26,653 --> 00:36:29,383
There you are.
I finally found you.

438
00:36:30,958 --> 00:36:34,018
We seemed to have accidentally
dropped you upon entry.

439
00:36:34,094 --> 00:36:37,154
Your fat servant
exceeded our weight limit.

440
00:36:37,231 --> 00:36:39,461
Fat servant?

441
00:36:39,533 --> 00:36:42,161
No, this is Muta. He's a friend.

442
00:36:42,236 --> 00:36:46,696
That's nice. Come on. Everyone's
dying to meet their new princess.

443
00:36:46,807 --> 00:36:49,173
Fat friend, you can come, too.

444
00:36:49,977 --> 00:36:53,743
- I don't know about this.
- The king is waiting in your castle.

445
00:36:53,814 --> 00:36:57,079
- My castle?
- The royal palace.

446
00:36:58,018 --> 00:37:01,181
- My castle?
- Well, soon enough.

447
00:37:01,288 --> 00:37:02,312
Hmm.

448
00:37:02,389 --> 00:37:04,687
Hey, where do you think you're going?

449
00:37:04,791 --> 00:37:08,227
The king's waiting for me.
It's rude not to say hi.

450
00:37:08,295 --> 00:37:10,889
Have you completely lost your mind?

451
00:37:10,964 --> 00:37:13,489
- This way.
- Wait a minute.

452
00:37:13,567 --> 00:37:15,660
Can she come with us?

453
00:37:17,337 --> 00:37:21,034
- Who are you?
- I'm Yuki. I serve at the royal table.

454
00:37:21,108 --> 00:37:23,941
Oh, so you're employed by the king?

455
00:37:24,011 --> 00:37:26,844
She works at the castle.
You'll see her there.

456
00:37:26,947 --> 00:37:29,006
- Come.
- See you soon, Yuki.

457
00:37:29,716 --> 00:37:31,707
Ow, ow, ow! Hey!

458
00:37:38,091 --> 00:37:40,184
Poor Haru.

459
00:38:05,519 --> 00:38:07,851
Ugh, look at that. Creepy.

460
00:38:13,927 --> 00:38:17,658
Mmm, looks good.
My future daughter-in-law.

461
00:38:21,401 --> 00:38:23,562
Hmm.

462
00:38:23,637 --> 00:38:27,471
All right! Think I'll go
and have a look in person.

463
00:38:29,843 --> 00:38:32,835
Hm. Why does that fatso
seem so familiar?

464
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:49,654
You'll need to change
before meeting the king.

465
00:38:49,763 --> 00:38:51,628
I get new clothes?

466
00:38:51,698 --> 00:38:54,428
- Please wait here, sir.
- I'm the baby-sitter.

467
00:38:54,534 --> 00:38:56,798
- Back off.
- What's your problem?

468
00:38:56,903 --> 00:39:00,031
Help yourself to refreshments
while you wait.

469
00:39:00,107 --> 00:39:02,166
Yeah, okay, I'll wait.

470
00:39:08,014 --> 00:39:09,208
Oh...

471
00:39:09,282 --> 00:39:11,648
Hey, not bad.

472
00:39:14,054 --> 00:39:16,386
Miss Haru, you're so lucky.

473
00:39:16,456 --> 00:39:19,653
Every girl in the cat kingdom
has a crush on Prince Lune.

474
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:22,490
I'm sure you'll be very happy together.

475
00:39:22,596 --> 00:39:26,657
You think?
No, wait. I don't think I wanna do this.

476
00:39:27,634 --> 00:39:30,535
Wow, don't you look good.

477
00:39:30,637 --> 00:39:33,606
Welcome to the royal family, babe.

478
00:39:37,644 --> 00:39:39,737
Hmm.

479
00:39:43,950 --> 00:39:45,383
Mmm.

480
00:39:45,452 --> 00:39:47,613
[Grunts]

481
00:39:55,295 --> 00:39:59,231
- Tell me, who is that cat?
- I believe his name is Muta.

482
00:39:59,299 --> 00:40:01,358
Muta?

483
00:40:02,169 --> 00:40:04,262
Never heard that name.

484
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:09,907
No match for my stomach.

485
00:40:11,178 --> 00:40:13,271
Hmm...

486
00:40:14,714 --> 00:40:19,845
King, I'm really flattered by all this
but I don't want to get married.

487
00:40:19,953 --> 00:40:23,912
You what? I was told
you had already consented.

488
00:40:23,990 --> 00:40:26,982
She has consented.
That's what I was told.

489
00:40:27,093 --> 00:40:31,826
- What does the prince say?
- He is away on official business.

490
00:40:33,934 --> 00:40:37,131
Look, first of all,
we don't really know each other

491
00:40:37,204 --> 00:40:39,365
and second of all, he's a cat, right?

492
00:40:39,473 --> 00:40:41,907
And I'm not.
So, clearly, I can't marry him.

493
00:40:42,008 --> 00:40:44,101
- Huh?
- Huh?

494
00:40:44,945 --> 00:40:46,879
[Both snigger]

495
00:40:46,980 --> 00:40:49,244
That has already been taken care of.

496
00:40:50,083 --> 00:40:52,176
You're half cat already.

497
00:40:57,691 --> 00:40:59,352
Oh...

498
00:40:59,459 --> 00:41:01,984
See, Miss Haru?

499
00:41:03,063 --> 00:41:04,223
[Gasps]

500
00:41:04,297 --> 00:41:06,390
Look at that. I'm a cat.

501
00:41:11,705 --> 00:41:13,764
[Meows]

502
00:41:16,109 --> 00:41:17,940
Muta!

503
00:41:19,246 --> 00:41:20,975
[Screams]

504
00:41:21,047 --> 00:41:23,140
Muta, what happened?

505
00:41:24,784 --> 00:41:29,414
He had a weakness for catnip jelly.
He saw the bowl and dove right in.

506
00:41:29,489 --> 00:41:34,017
Muta, you weren't supposed to die.
It's all my fault.

507
00:41:34,094 --> 00:41:36,790
Don't leave me like this, Muta.

508
00:41:37,831 --> 00:41:40,061
Time for the celebration.

509
00:41:40,166 --> 00:41:42,100
No, I won't leave him!

510
00:41:42,202 --> 00:41:44,295
Then we'll bring him with us.

511
00:41:53,713 --> 00:41:55,806
[Haru cries]

512
00:41:56,850 --> 00:42:00,445
- That's Prince Lune's bride.
- She has lovely fur.

513
00:42:00,554 --> 00:42:02,784
And such delicate paws.

514
00:42:06,793 --> 00:42:09,057
I hear you don't care for mice

515
00:42:09,129 --> 00:42:13,327
but I bet you can't resist
my juicy, raw fish, huh?

516
00:42:13,433 --> 00:42:16,061
I'm not sure she's enjoying herself.

517
00:42:16,169 --> 00:42:20,105
- How about some entertainment?
- Excellent suggestion.

518
00:42:27,147 --> 00:42:29,240
[Lively music]

519
00:42:42,662 --> 00:42:45,096
[Laughter]

520
00:42:45,165 --> 00:42:47,258
[Sobs]

521
00:42:49,169 --> 00:42:51,637
- Not entertaining enough.
- Yes, sire.

522
00:42:56,309 --> 00:42:57,776
[Shrieks]

523
00:43:09,255 --> 00:43:11,348

[Yells]

525
00:43:26,906 --> 00:43:28,396
Next.

526
00:43:44,557 --> 00:43:46,650
[Laughs]

527
00:43:53,967 --> 00:43:55,764
[Yells]

528
00:43:55,869 --> 00:43:59,100
Whoever's next better not stink. Got it?

529
00:43:59,205 --> 00:44:01,298
[All gasp and whimper]

530
00:44:17,791 --> 00:44:21,488
Your Majesty, I promise that I will
make the young lady smile.

531
00:44:23,363 --> 00:44:26,526
- Shall we try him?
- Sure. Why not?

532
00:44:30,236 --> 00:44:32,204
Huh?

533
00:44:32,272 --> 00:44:35,298
Excuse me.
Would you care to dance?

534
00:44:35,875 --> 00:44:37,934
Oh no, I'm a meow-sy dancer.

535
00:44:39,145 --> 00:44:41,238
Now I'm starting to talk like a cat.

536
00:44:43,316 --> 00:44:45,181
Just trust me.

537
00:44:54,994 --> 00:44:57,053
[Accordion starts up]

538
00:45:29,929 --> 00:45:32,864
Well, she seems to be entertained now.

539
00:45:45,345 --> 00:45:47,370
<i>[Thinks] What's happening to me?</i>

540
00:45:48,214 --> 00:45:50,444
<i>I've never felt like this before.</i>

541
00:45:51,284 --> 00:45:53,411
<i>Maybe life as a cat wouldn't be so bad.</i>

542
00:45:55,989 --> 00:45:59,425
Careful, Haru. Don't lose yourself.

543
00:45:59,492 --> 00:46:00,652
Huh?

544
00:46:00,760 --> 00:46:02,819
Believe in who you are.

545
00:46:05,165 --> 00:46:07,258
[Slurps]

546
00:46:07,367 --> 00:46:08,356
[Burps]

547
00:46:10,370 --> 00:46:12,804
I said so before, didn't I?

548
00:46:14,174 --> 00:46:15,573
Then you must be...

549
00:46:19,245 --> 00:46:21,338
Stop right there, pal!

550
00:46:30,924 --> 00:46:33,688
You're not from my kingdom, are you?

551
00:46:33,793 --> 00:46:36,318
Exactly who are you?

552
00:46:37,831 --> 00:46:40,857
How rude of me.
I should have introduced myself.

553
00:46:43,102 --> 00:46:45,662
I am exactly who I appear to be.

554
00:46:52,478 --> 00:46:56,608
I am Baron Humbert von Gikkingen
and I have come for Haru.

555
00:46:56,716 --> 00:46:57,944
Baron!

556
00:46:58,017 --> 00:47:01,145
- He's so cool.
- He is handsome.

557
00:47:01,221 --> 00:47:03,621
He can't have her. Seize them!

558
00:47:16,736 --> 00:47:18,169
[Groans]

559
00:47:18,238 --> 00:47:19,705
I'm stuffed.

560
00:47:21,741 --> 00:47:23,834
Muta? You're still alive!

561
00:47:25,245 --> 00:47:28,976
- Oh no!
- Give me back my daughter-in-law.

562
00:47:29,549 --> 00:47:31,983
Quickly,
get His Majesty to a safe place.

563
00:47:36,189 --> 00:47:40,148
Emergency exit for all guests
right here, please. Enjoy your day.

564
00:47:48,534 --> 00:47:51,094
Great technique, Muta.

565
00:47:51,204 --> 00:47:53,263
I just lost my balance.

566
00:47:54,807 --> 00:47:56,866
Over here.

567
00:47:58,611 --> 00:48:00,238
Yuki, you're here.

568
00:48:00,313 --> 00:48:03,680
I'm so thankful
you were able to help Miss Haru, Baron.

569
00:48:03,750 --> 00:48:05,240
Do we know each other?

570
00:48:05,351 --> 00:48:08,013
Many of us here
know of you and your bureau.

571
00:48:08,087 --> 00:48:12,649
Yuki, I'm an idiot. I should've left
when you told me to. Now look at me.

572
00:48:12,725 --> 00:48:17,059
If you leave here by dawn,
you can still turn back into a human.

573
00:48:17,130 --> 00:48:18,324
I will?

574
00:48:18,398 --> 00:48:20,764
This will get you outside the castle.

575
00:48:20,867 --> 00:48:24,064
- Perfect.
- Wait. Where's Muta?

576
00:48:31,544 --> 00:48:33,068
Hmm.

577
00:48:33,179 --> 00:48:36,342
He'll be fine.
We just need to get you home.

578
00:48:38,851 --> 00:48:40,876
[Shrieks]

579
00:48:46,426 --> 00:48:48,155
The back of the castle.

580
00:48:48,227 --> 00:48:51,321
The door to your world
is at the top of that tower.

581
00:48:51,431 --> 00:48:53,558
[Haru] You've got to be kidding me?

582
00:48:53,633 --> 00:48:57,330
And the only way to get to the tower
is through the king's maze.

583
00:48:57,437 --> 00:48:59,337
Naturally.

584
00:48:59,439 --> 00:49:03,239
Good luck.
And, Baron, take good care of Haru.

585
00:49:03,309 --> 00:49:05,106
Hey, wait.

586
00:49:05,178 --> 00:49:08,705
She's already gone.
I didn't have a chance to thank her.

587
00:49:08,815 --> 00:49:11,511
Haru, does her voice
sound familiar to you?

588
00:49:11,617 --> 00:49:15,610
Is it possible that she told you
to seek help at the Cat Bureau?

589
00:49:15,688 --> 00:49:20,421
<i>[Yuki] Haru, go to the Cat Bureau.</i>
<i>You must find the Cat Bureau.</i>

590
00:49:20,493 --> 00:49:23,189
You're right.
That was her voice.

591
00:49:23,262 --> 00:49:25,696
But why help me?

592
00:49:25,765 --> 00:49:27,858
[Yelling]

593
00:49:30,803 --> 00:49:32,134
Ah! Ah! Ah!

594
00:49:36,876 --> 00:49:40,403
Whose idea was it to leave without me?
I nearly got killed.

595
00:49:40,513 --> 00:49:43,141
This is no time for finger pointing.

596
00:49:45,385 --> 00:49:47,478
You're leaving me again?

597
00:49:52,191 --> 00:49:55,524
- Are they going in?
- Yes, they've just begun.

598
00:49:55,628 --> 00:49:57,061
Purr-fect.

599
00:49:57,163 --> 00:49:59,859
No one's ever come out alive,
have they?

600
00:49:59,932 --> 00:50:02,867
We can watch them go nuts
from over here.

601
00:50:06,406 --> 00:50:09,398
- Hurry, we don't have much time.
- It's still noon.

602
00:50:09,509 --> 00:50:13,775
- It's always noon here.
- What do you mean?

603
00:50:13,880 --> 00:50:19,079
- At home, it's already after midnight.
- What? We've got to go faster.

604
00:50:21,387 --> 00:50:22,581
Where do we go?

605
00:50:25,224 --> 00:50:26,691
They're lost already?

606
00:50:26,759 --> 00:50:29,728
They're doing worse
than most of our victims.

607
00:50:30,063 --> 00:50:31,394
Pleased, Your Majesty?

608
00:50:32,465 --> 00:50:34,524
Feeling good, babe.

609
00:50:34,600 --> 00:50:36,830
- Where are the guards?
- Right there.

610
00:50:36,903 --> 00:50:38,962
Hut, hut, hut, hut...

611
00:50:39,772 --> 00:50:43,708
Let's start with this path. If we're
methodical, we'll find our way.

612
00:50:43,776 --> 00:50:47,337
Keep your eye on the tower.
That will allow us to stay oriented.

613
00:50:47,413 --> 00:50:49,244
Good idea.

614
00:50:49,348 --> 00:50:50,838
Muta, you're cheating.

615
00:50:50,917 --> 00:50:53,886
Gimme a break.
You think I'll get in trouble?

616
00:50:55,221 --> 00:50:57,189
He's cheating.

617
00:50:57,256 --> 00:51:00,123
She's gonna rub this in my face,
isn't she?

618
00:51:02,195 --> 00:51:05,164
Let's get out of here
while Muta keeps them occupied.

619
00:51:05,298 --> 00:51:07,892
Again, I'm tricked into being bait.

620
00:51:21,914 --> 00:51:24,007
Stay behind me, Haru.

621
00:51:39,098 --> 00:51:40,656
Wow!

622
00:51:40,766 --> 00:51:42,495
Oh, how's your cane?

623
00:51:42,568 --> 00:51:46,004
Bent, but it's about time
for a new one anyway.

624
00:51:46,072 --> 00:51:48,131
I never knew they were so useful.

625
00:51:55,581 --> 00:51:57,674
Nice shot, sire.

626
00:52:02,488 --> 00:52:04,888
- Oh no, you hit one of ours.
- I did?

627
00:52:04,957 --> 00:52:09,087
- Your Majesty, how could you?
- Let's keep that between us.

628
00:52:09,162 --> 00:52:12,757
Excuse me,
but I think there's a bit of a problem.

629
00:52:12,899 --> 00:52:16,630
- Our guards are scattered.
- Don't tell me they're lost, too?

630
00:52:16,836 --> 00:52:18,929
[King] Where's my princess?

631
00:52:19,272 --> 00:52:21,968
She's already halfway through.

632
00:52:24,010 --> 00:52:25,910
- Hey!
- You found us.

633
00:52:25,978 --> 00:52:29,141
- What's that way like?
- Just dead ends.

634
00:52:44,363 --> 00:52:45,728
[Chuckles]

635
00:52:45,831 --> 00:52:47,958
Now this is more like it, babe.

636
00:52:49,702 --> 00:52:53,604
Hm, another dead end.
My, my, this is getting interesting.

637
00:52:54,640 --> 00:52:57,006
Two rights and a left...

638
00:52:57,109 --> 00:52:59,907
Wait a minute,
I know there wasn't a wall here.

639
00:52:59,979 --> 00:53:04,143
- Your brain's overheating.
- We just walked through here, Muta.

640
00:53:04,250 --> 00:53:06,980
What, walls have legs?

641
00:53:11,224 --> 00:53:13,988
She's right, Muta.
This wall is fake.

642
00:53:15,294 --> 00:53:16,488
[Meows]

643
00:53:16,562 --> 00:53:19,030
[All meow]

644
00:53:25,471 --> 00:53:27,530
- Told you.
- Good work, Haru.

645
00:53:27,607 --> 00:53:29,507
All right, fine, good work.

646
00:53:30,876 --> 00:53:35,142
How stupid do you have to be
to line up like dominoes?

647
00:53:35,214 --> 00:53:37,273
[Meowing]

648
00:53:38,751 --> 00:53:42,881
- Princess!
- Wait. It's not safe, Your Majesty.

649
00:53:50,896 --> 00:53:53,126
Go ahead. I'll catch up to you.

650
00:53:55,101 --> 00:53:57,194
Oh!

651
00:53:58,037 --> 00:53:59,265
What a show-off.

652
00:54:00,906 --> 00:54:02,840
- I can walk.
- Don't worry.

653
00:54:17,990 --> 00:54:20,083
Hmm?

654
00:54:22,128 --> 00:54:24,460
Your Majesty!
This is very dangerous.

655
00:54:24,530 --> 00:54:25,997
I can't let them escape.

656
00:54:26,432 --> 00:54:31,267
You'll never reach them in time.
Besides, we have guards in the tower.

657
00:54:33,306 --> 00:54:35,035
Why didn't you say so?

658
00:54:42,081 --> 00:54:44,447
[Chuckles] Toast.

659
00:54:48,387 --> 00:54:49,615
Whoa!

660
00:54:56,228 --> 00:55:00,688
- I'll have a word with the contractors.
- It's too late for that.

661
00:55:01,667 --> 00:55:04,500
We'll have to use the detonator.

662
00:55:04,570 --> 00:55:07,095
Not that, I beg of you, sire.

663
00:55:07,206 --> 00:55:10,004
Think of what it will do
to your approval ratings.

664
00:55:10,142 --> 00:55:13,077
- Button.
- I must have left it in the castle.

665
00:55:13,145 --> 00:55:14,305
Look what I found.

666
00:55:14,413 --> 00:55:16,472
No! Oh! No!

667
00:55:18,551 --> 00:55:21,315
Hey, we made it to the top.

668
00:55:21,387 --> 00:55:23,480
[Baron] Not much further now.

669
00:55:25,291 --> 00:55:27,350
Bye-bye, tower.

670
00:55:32,665 --> 00:55:34,530
- Baron!
- Brace yourselves.

671
00:55:49,415 --> 00:55:50,905
[Chuckles]

672
00:55:51,050 --> 00:55:53,814
Excellent explosion, Your Majesty.

673
00:55:54,420 --> 00:55:56,479
Let's go.

674
00:55:59,158 --> 00:56:02,252
You've got to be kidding.
We're back where we started.

675
00:56:02,361 --> 00:56:05,125
Now what do we do?
Just stand here?

676
00:56:05,197 --> 00:56:06,687
Nothing else we can do.

677
00:56:06,866 --> 00:56:09,232
Hut, hut, hut, hut...

678
00:56:09,335 --> 00:56:11,599
[King] Quick, quick! Get 'em! Get 'em!

679
00:56:13,372 --> 00:56:16,705
Baron, nice to see you again.

680
00:56:16,776 --> 00:56:20,234
Princess, would you please
accompany me back to the castle?

681
00:56:21,914 --> 00:56:24,007
Being a cat's not so bad.

682
00:56:24,083 --> 00:56:26,984
Do I have to learn to eat mice?

683
00:56:27,052 --> 00:56:29,748
Perhaps you shouldn't give up
quite yet, Haru.

684
00:56:46,205 --> 00:56:49,174
What in the world has Father done now?

685
00:56:49,241 --> 00:56:51,334
Father!

686
00:56:52,244 --> 00:56:55,407
Lune? You're back already?

687
00:56:56,115 --> 00:56:58,379
The prince is here. Line up!

688
00:56:58,451 --> 00:57:00,146
It's the prince?

689
00:57:05,791 --> 00:57:08,692
Yuki sent a message
saying it was urgent I return.

690
00:57:08,761 --> 00:57:11,389
Perhaps you'd like to tell me
what's going on?

691
00:57:11,897 --> 00:57:14,195
Miss Haru!

692
00:57:14,266 --> 00:57:17,099
- Yuki, you're here.
- I'm glad Lune made it in time.

693
00:57:17,169 --> 00:57:19,831
I just wanted to repay
the girl who rescued you.

694
00:57:19,905 --> 00:57:22,738
And I thought, just maybe,
you would be happy

695
00:57:22,808 --> 00:57:26,437
to have a good-looking girl like Haru
for a bride.

696
00:57:26,545 --> 00:57:30,811
I have already chosen my bride.
I have decided to marry Yuki.

697
00:57:33,352 --> 00:57:35,013
That thing?

698
00:57:35,120 --> 00:57:38,283
- Guess it was a surprise.
- I like this prince.

699
00:57:43,596 --> 00:57:47,828
This is for you. I traveled
to your old home to get these.

700
00:57:54,106 --> 00:57:56,836
I haven't had these in years.

701
00:57:56,942 --> 00:58:00,400
Wow.
I used to love those when I was a kid.

702
00:58:00,546 --> 00:58:06,382
I know. You fed me a whole box of these
when I was just a stray.

703
00:58:06,452 --> 00:58:09,012
That filthy little kitten was you?

704
00:58:09,121 --> 00:58:12,557
You're so beautiful now,
I never would have recognized you.

705
00:58:12,691 --> 00:58:17,060
Yuki, will you accept these crackers
as a symbol of my love for you

706
00:58:17,129 --> 00:58:19,427
for as long
as our nine lives shall last?

707
00:58:21,367 --> 00:58:23,767
So these crackers mean that

708
00:58:23,836 --> 00:58:26,566
you can marry the prince instead of me!

709
00:58:28,474 --> 00:58:31,568
I'm so happy for you.

710
00:58:31,644 --> 00:58:33,509
Thank you, Haru.

711
00:58:33,579 --> 00:58:36,139
Thank you for feeding me
when I was a kitten.

712
00:58:36,215 --> 00:58:38,581
Without you
I might not be alive today.

713
00:58:38,684 --> 00:58:42,120
You're the girl with the fish crackers
Yuki told me about.

714
00:58:42,187 --> 00:58:45,714
And you also rescued me
when I nearly got killed by a truck.

715
00:58:45,824 --> 00:58:50,022
We both owe you our lives, Haru.
What can we do to repay you?

716
00:58:50,095 --> 00:58:54,054
You don't have to repay me.
I'm just glad things turned out so well.

717
00:58:54,133 --> 00:58:56,761
I guess I did the right thing after all.

720
00:59:04,009 --> 00:59:07,035
I had no idea
you had a bride in mind already.

721
00:59:07,112 --> 00:59:09,774
You should've told me.

722
00:59:09,848 --> 00:59:13,045
Poor Haru.
You must feel like such a loser.

723
00:59:13,152 --> 00:59:15,416
- Not really.
- I'm sure you do.

724
00:59:15,487 --> 00:59:19,014
So, I have a great idea.
You should marry me instead.

725
00:59:19,959 --> 00:59:25,522
I'll get you some fish, too, as a symbol
of my undying love and all that.

726
00:59:25,598 --> 00:59:26,622
So?

727
00:59:26,732 --> 00:59:30,133
That's very generous,
but I just want to be myself.

728
00:59:30,202 --> 00:59:33,103
I'll change you back if you marry me.

729
00:59:33,205 --> 00:59:34,229
Hm?

730
00:59:34,340 --> 00:59:36,740
I've had just about enough of you.

731
00:59:38,911 --> 00:59:43,871
Nobody who decided who I am but me,
and there's no way I'd ever marry you.

732
00:59:47,052 --> 00:59:48,246
Was that a no?

736

I respect a woman
who stands up for herself.

738
00:59:59,665 --> 01:00:03,123
Even if she does stick her nose
in other people's business.

739
01:00:03,235 --> 01:00:05,999
So I, Renaldo Moon, will defend her.

740
01:00:06,071 --> 01:00:08,539
- Renaldo?
- Renaldo Moon?

741
01:00:08,607 --> 01:00:12,099
- The Renaldo Moon?
- So that's who he is.

742
01:00:12,177 --> 01:00:14,407
- Who?
- How could you have forgotten?

743
01:00:14,480 --> 01:00:18,780
He's such a notorious criminal,
his story is written on our walls.

744
01:00:18,851 --> 01:00:21,786
Years back,
an enormous white cat appeared,

745
01:00:21,887 --> 01:00:24,913
devoured all the fish in the lake
and then ran off.

746
01:00:24,990 --> 01:00:28,721
He called himself Renaldo Moon.

747
01:00:28,827 --> 01:00:32,228
Did you really do that, Muta?
That's disgusting.

748
01:00:32,297 --> 01:00:35,130
And this time
I'll eat the entire castle.

749
01:00:36,201 --> 01:00:39,193
Hurry! Get His Majesty to safety, now!

750
01:00:44,376 --> 01:00:46,435

751
01:00:46,812 --> 01:00:49,610
Yes, sir.
Cat guard, advance.

Oh, you traitor.

753

Please, sire, it's not safe.

754
01:00:56,355 --> 01:01:00,018
Take Miss Haru to the exit. I'll hold
back the king as long as I can.

01:10:05,770 --> 01:10:06,896
Huh?

865
01:10:06,972 --> 01:10:09,031
So...

866
01:10:09,507 --> 01:10:11,566
I made some breakfast for both of us.

867
01:10:11,776 --> 01:10:14,142
- What?
- I'm done so help yourself.

868
01:10:14,246 --> 01:10:16,544
And I made some tea, too.

869
01:10:16,615 --> 01:10:18,674
- Oh, by the way...
- [gasps]

870
01:10:19,618 --> 01:10:21,950
...that's my own special blend of tea.

871
01:10:22,020 --> 01:10:25,786
It's a bit different every time
so I can't guarantee the flavor.

872
01:10:27,859 --> 01:10:29,952
Oh, okay.

873
01:10:33,832 --> 01:10:36,232
What do you know? Smells good.

874
01:10:36,301 --> 01:10:38,360
[Girl] That's a great outfit.

875
01:10:38,837 --> 01:10:41,670
I got some big news
you'll be excited about.

876
01:10:41,773 --> 01:10:43,968
Yeah? What is it?

877
01:10:44,042 --> 01:10:47,534
Machida broke up with his girlfriend.

878
01:10:51,616 --> 01:10:55,245
- Oh, that's too bad.
- What? Are you kidding?

879
01:10:55,353 --> 01:10:58,550
- What do you mean?
- I thought you'd be ecstatic.

880
01:10:58,657 --> 01:11:01,854
Not really. Doesn't matter any more.

881
01:11:13,838 --> 01:11:16,136
- Hey, are you okay?
- I'm fine.

882
01:11:16,207 --> 01:11:18,937
- Liar.
- I'm better than ever.

883
01:11:20,111 --> 01:11:23,547
What's going on with you and Tsuge?

884
01:11:23,648 --> 01:11:25,047
Nothing new.

885
01:11:25,150 --> 01:11:27,710
- Come on.
- Nothing's happening.

886
01:11:30,689 --> 01:11:32,748
[Muta yawns]

887
01:11:32,857 --> 01:11:34,950
[Japanese background song]

888
01:11:46,503 --> 01:11:46,992
<<<SKIPPED>>>

889
01:15:10,941 --> 01:15:11,430
<<<SKIPPED>>>

890
01:15:15,180 --> 01:15:15,349
<<<SKIPPED>>>
