00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:37,280
I thought you were the one
person I could trust.

179
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:39,050
So you can forgive
Regina and Gold

180
00:07:39,050 --> 00:07:41,050
for everything they've done,
but not me?

181
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:42,860
They've changed.

182
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:45,290

they changed.

183
00:07:45,290 --> 00:07:46,690
So did I.

184
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:48,730
When
we first met, yeah.

185
00:07:48,730 --> 00:07:52,030
But the minute things got tough,
you didn't come to anybody.

186
00:07:52,030 --> 00:07:54,970
You decided that you would
figure it out on your own.

187
00:07:54,970 --> 00:07:56,870
We were a team.

188
00:07:56,870 --> 00:07:58,570

I remember.

189
00:07:58,570 --> 00:08:01,210
But now you just want
your dark magic back

190
00:08:01,210 --> 00:08:02,610
so you can do it alone.

191
00:08:02,610 --> 00:08:06,280
And I've seen what you do
with dark magic.

Emma.

193
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:15,220
[Belle] We should really get
to the library.

00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:16,320
We've got
a lot to do.

195
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:18,490
[Regina] I have a stop
to make first.

196
00:08:18,490 --> 00:08:20,290
I'll meet you there.

197
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:22,760

I'm not invited.

and let us save you.

we can do.

It's too late.

206
00:08:39,180 --> 00:08:42,350
The vault has already forged
Hook as its new Dark One.

207
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:45,690
He went this way.

208
00:08:45,690 --> 00:08:47,090
This way!

209
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:54,530
And then
the tracks disappear.

210
00:08:54,530 --> 00:08:56,130
We should split up,
search the woods.

211
00:08:56,130 --> 00:08:57,000
He's a Dark One.

212
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,600
He can transport himself
anywhere.

213
00:08:58,600 --> 00:08:59,670
So can Emma.

214
00:08:59,670 --> 00:09:00,700
We've got to start
looking somewhere.

215
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:01,970
[Merlin] There's
no time.

216
00:09:01,970 --> 00:09:04,200
Of all the paths I foresaw
for your daughter,

217
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:06,040
I'm afraid that
this was the darkest.

[crickets chirping]
[night animals calling]

219
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:09,640
We should return
to Granny's.

220
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:10,310
Even without
my magic,

221
00:09:10,310 --> 00:09:12,350
I still have enough ingredients
to make preparations.

222
00:09:12,350 --> 00:09:13,350
I don't care how bad
things got...

223
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:15,350
- Emma wouldn't hurt us.
- Maybe.

224
00:09:15,350 --> 00:09:17,550
But this new
Dark One,

225
00:09:17,550 --> 00:09:19,820
we need as many allies
as we can get.

226
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:22,860
Lancelot, your mother's
the Lady of the Lake.

227
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:23,860
Could she help us?

228
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:25,490
- Perhaps.

She does have
great power.

The lake is but a two-day
journey from here.

233
00:09:31,530 --> 00:09:32,700
It's worth a try.

234
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:34,300
And if I don't
make it in time?

235
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:35,500
Well,
then you get to spend

236
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:37,100
your last moments
with your mother.

237
00:09:44,010 --> 00:09:47,180

Mary Margaret.

and ending this.

would have been dead.

She chose love,
David.

242
00:09:55,050 --> 00:09:57,060
And we would have done
the same thing.

243
00:09:57,060 --> 00:09:58,320
We'd share
one heart

244
00:09:58,330 --> 00:10:00,890
because we took the same kind
of risk that Emma took.

245

We save each other.
That is what our family does.

faith in her.

is justified.
