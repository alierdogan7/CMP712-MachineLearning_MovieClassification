 I became first a slave,

17

-Ah, but I know him, Lord.
-No, Father Beocca.

178
00:11:24,319 --> 00:11:26,479
You knew him, once.

179
00:11:26,479 --> 00:11:28,639
You knew him as a child.

180
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:30,280
I could send word out
into the country...

181
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:32,720
Father, look, he's a ghost.
He's a pagan rumour.

182
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:36,680
Should he become
flesh and blood, then he may
merit a mention.

183
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:41,680
However, my faith,
I reserve for God alone.

184
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:48,560
Now, about this girl.
You may be right about her.

185
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:51,560
Bring her into
my personal service

186
00:11:52,159 --> 00:11:54,079
and pray for me.

187
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:56,600
As always, My Lord.

188
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:07,119
AETHELRED: Alfred.

189
00:12:07,119 --> 00:12:10,519
King Edmund of East Anglia
writes a plea to Wessex
for an army.

190
00:12:10,519 --> 00:12:14,360
"An attack by the
Danish chieftain, Earl Ubba,
is inevitable."

191
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:16,200
This was two days ago.

192
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:19,079
A long march to fight
the Danes at a place
of their choosing,

193
00:12:19,079 --> 00:12:21,239
is not a strategy
worth considering.

194
00:12:21,239 --> 00:12:22,200
To say the least, My Lord.

195
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:24,759
-I'm of a mind to decline.
-And rightly!

196
00:12:24,759 --> 00:12:25,639
Ubba. He is...

197
00:12:25,639 --> 00:12:28,800
The Dane whom King Edmund has
fed and watered in the past?

198
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:31,200
-He is.
-Perhaps in the hope
that he would simply

199
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:34,319
pass through East Anglia
on his way to invading Wessex.

200
00:12:34,319 --> 00:12:37,560
It is my opinion that Edmund
deserves nothing but silence.

201
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:38,839
Too harsh, Young Odda.

202
00:12:38,839 --> 00:12:41,479
I believe it was Edmund's
hope to convert the Danes

203
00:12:41,479 --> 00:12:44,159
from pagan to Christian,
beginning with charity.

204
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:46,239
For that,
he deserves praise, surely.

205
00:12:46,239 --> 00:12:48,800
You are true, My Lord,
if indeed that was his hope.

206
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:49,519
Edmund is a godly man.

207
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:52,720
We have no reason to mistake
his actions for cowardice.

208
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:54,039
Regardless of
Edmund's intentions,

209
00:12:54,039 --> 00:12:57,039
barring a miracle,
East Anglia will soon
fall to the Danes.

210
00:12:57,039 --> 00:13:00,200
And he shall have
all our prayers for
such a miracle, My Lord.

211
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:00,759
He will need them.

212
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:03,439
He will not, however,
have one man of Wessex,

213
00:13:03,439 --> 00:13:05,000
on that we are agreed?

214
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,639
-Yes, Lord.
-Aye.

215
00:13:07,039 --> 00:13:11,039
Then we must
therefore recognise
that we now stand alone.

216
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:13,759
The last kingdom of England.

217
00:13:13,759 --> 00:13:15,319
It will soon be
the men of Wessex

218
00:13:15,319 --> 00:13:17,280
staring across a field
at the pagan army.

219
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:20,079
We must be ready.
We must pray, we must prepare.

220
00:13:20,119 --> 00:13:23,560
Odda, I require that Mercia,
Lundene and East Anglia

221
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:24,560
be watched. Carefully.

222
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:26,280
-Forward knowledge
is everything.
-It is done, My Lord.

223
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:29,759
And scribe,
I require the forges
of every town and village

224
00:13:29,759 --> 00:13:30,600
to be burning, night and day.

225
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:33,519
We shall need all the iron
those fires can proffer.

226
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:35,360
SCRIBE: Yes, My Lord.

227
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:38,280
Most of all, I require men.

228
00:13:39,039 --> 00:13:40,639
Strong, fighting men

229
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:43,759
who are prepared to die,
because that, in the end,

230
00:13:43,759 --> 00:13:47,039
is what it will take
to save us.

231
00:13:49,479 --> 00:13:51,600
The blood of men.

232
00:13:54,319 --> 00:13:58,119

"Never fight Ubba."

East Anglia's just
made that mistake.

234

BRIDA: Ubba is unpredictable.

237
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:16,479
He takes his orders
from the gods.

238
00:14:16,479 --> 00:14:20,360
UHTRED: I know.
He only listens to a sorcerer.

239
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:21,479
And he's half mad.

240
00:14:21,479 --> 00:14:23,759
How will you approach him?

241
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:26,000
As a man.

242
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,720
It has to be done.

243
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:32,319
Yes, it has to be done.

244
00:14:32,319 --> 00:14:35,159

00:14:45,439 --> 00:14:47,720
We should hump tonight.

We should, it's written.

00:20:05,159 --> 00:20:07,000
-And you will wait.
-Kill him.

349
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,119
UBBA: Not another word.

350
00:20:08,119 --> 00:20:10,720
Bar the doors,
he does not leave.
Guthrum is right.

351
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:14,479
We are entertaining a king,
so no more interruptions.

352
00:20:14,479 --> 00:20:19,039
I just have to know.
Who is that? Hmm?

353
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:23,319
His eyes are watching me.

354
00:20:23,319 --> 00:20:24,079
And me.

355
00:20:24,079 --> 00:20:26,639
(STAMMERING) Who's what? Who?

356
00:20:26,639 --> 00:20:29,360
The other
half-naked image here.

357
00:20:30,639 --> 00:20:32,119
UBBA: Who is it?

358
00:20:32,119 --> 00:20:33,439
(EXHALES)

359
00:20:33,439 --> 00:20:34,839
That is Saint Sebastian,

360
00:20:34,839 --> 00:20:37,319
a former Roman soldier
who found God.

361
00:20:37,319 --> 00:20:39,400
GUTHRUM: Found him where?

362
00:20:39,639 --> 00:20:40,119
He...

363
00:20:40,119 --> 00:20:42,479
He found him
in his heart, not...

364
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:46,560
Do you wish me
to tell you his story?

365
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:48,439
I have time.

366
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:56,079
EDMUND: The Emperor of Rome,
on discovering that Sebastian
had found God,

367
00:20:56,079 --> 00:20:58,280
ordered him
to renounce his faith.
He refused.

368
00:20:58,280 --> 00:21:03,639
So, then the Emperor
ordered that he be filled
full of arrows.

369
00:21:03,639 --> 00:21:06,600
And yet, he lived.

370
00:21:08,039 --> 00:21:10,039
-He lived?
-Yes, he did.

371
00:21:10,039 --> 00:21:10,800
Is this true?

372
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:12,600
Of course, it's true.

373
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:13,680
God saved Saint Sebastian

374
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:16,079
and God should be praised
for that mercy.

375
00:21:16,079 --> 00:21:17,759
For how long did he live?

376
00:21:17,759 --> 00:21:19,319
(DRAWS DEEP BREATH)

377
00:21:19,319 --> 00:21:20,159
Well, sadly he...

378
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:24,079
He then ordered him
to be, uh, clubbed to death.

379
00:21:26,079 --> 00:21:26,759
So, he died?

380
00:21:26,759 --> 00:21:29,280
He went to heaven,
so he lived.

381
00:21:29,479 --> 00:21:31,439
I heard mention
of this "heaven".

382
00:21:31,439 --> 00:21:32,720
Ah, what is this "heaven"?

383
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:34,720
Heaven is Valhalla, Lord,
to the Christians,

384
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:37,119
but without the fighting,
feasting and humping.

385
00:21:37,119 --> 00:21:41,639
Heaven is heaven!
It's not heathen.

386
00:21:42,519 --> 00:21:45,079
But to answer your
very first question,

387
00:21:45,079 --> 00:21:46,400
I have considered your offer,

388
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:50,560
and yes, I will continue
to rule East Anglia,
as you suggest.

389
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:52,159
EDMUND: I will suffer
your presence.

390
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:58,400
I will provide you with
horses, food, coin
and hostages.

391
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:01,079
I will do all that you demand.

392
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:03,360
EDMUND: But...

393
00:22:03,639 --> 00:22:07,280
Only if you, Lord Ubba,

394
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:09,479
and all of your men

395
00:22:10,079 --> 00:22:11,720
submit to God.

396
00:22:12,319 --> 00:22:14,039
That is my demand.

397
00:22:14,039 --> 00:22:17,039
You must be baptised.

398
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:22,000
You must stand
in a barrel of water,

399
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,680
and they pour more water
over you.

400
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:28,560
-They want to wash me?
-No. (SCOFFS)

401
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:30,239
Your scent upsets them, Ubba.

402
00:22:30,239 --> 00:22:31,600
No, to cleanse you
of your sins.

403
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:35,720
There is only one God,
and I demand
that you serve him.

404
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:36,439
Kill him now!

405
00:22:36,439 --> 00:22:38,800
-Why must I serve him?
-Because God is great.

406
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:40,280
All powerful. All magnificent.

407
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:43,479
Have him stop his yapping
and prove it!

408
00:22:43,479 --> 00:22:44,239
Ah, agreed.

409
00:22:44,239 --> 00:22:47,280
Prove to me your God is great.
Prove it.

410
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:50,400
Prove?
(STAMMERING) Look! Here!

411
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:52,119
God spared Saint Sebastian.

412
00:22:52,119 --> 00:22:54,560
-But the man still died.
-Because it was God's will!

413
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:57,079
So would your God protect you
from my arrows?

414
00:22:57,079 --> 00:22:58,400
If he was all powerful,
he would.

415
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:01,200
Yes! If it was God's will,
he would, yes!

416
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:03,200
UBBA: So let us try.

417
00:23:03,439 --> 00:23:08,439
We shall shoot arrows at you,
and if you survive...

418
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:10,239
(CHUCKLES)

419
00:23:10,439 --> 00:23:13,280
We will all be washed.

420
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:15,560
Including Guthrum here.

421
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:17,000
Why not?

422
00:23:23,119 --> 00:23:24,600
Very well.

423
00:23:28,319 --> 00:23:31,360
I will continue to be King,

424
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:35,560
but we will dispense with
the need for the baptisms.

425
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:37,759
The, uh... The washing.

426
00:23:37,759 --> 00:23:39,079
I withdraw my request.

427
00:23:39,079 --> 00:23:42,639
But you claim your God
is all powerful.

428
00:23:43,439 --> 00:23:45,519
I want it proven.

429
00:23:45,639 --> 00:23:47,720
-Uh...
-Strip him.

430
00:23:48,439 --> 00:23:49,680

432
00:24:03,119 --> 00:24:05,200
Tell me truthfully.

433
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:08,239
Are you afraid?

434
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,759
God is great.

435
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:14,600
We will see.

436
00:24:19,639 --> 00:24:21,039
Shoot.

437
00:24:22,479 --> 00:24:24,720
-Shoot!
-Ah, ah, ah...

438
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:29,000
They are my men
and only I tell them
when to shoot.

to be clubbed,

or will the arrows
be sufficient?

boy, to tell me

446
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:51,479
that it was Danes,
and not you,
that killed Ragnar.

447
00:24:51,479 --> 00:24:55,800
It was Kjartan and Sven, Lord.
And others.

448
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:59,360
It's the truth.
Why else would I be here?

449
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:00,479
To spy.

450
00:25:00,519 --> 00:25:02,280
-To lie.
-No, Lord.

(UBBA LAUGHS)

452
00:25:03,439 --> 00:25:06,239
-Perhaps to kill me?
-No, Lord.

Have you been washed?

been washed?

Yes, Lord.

if Odin will protect you
from the arrows.

For a long sword?

527
00:29:27,759 --> 00:29:31,119
Tell me what you need
and I'll tell you a price.

528
00:29:31,119 --> 00:29:34,639
A warrior's sword
to last a lifetime.

529
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:36,519
What are you?

530
00:29:37,159 --> 00:29:39,360
Saxon or Dane?

531
00:29:40,759 --> 00:29:42,439
Northumbria.

532
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:47,400
It will take some time
to make her right,

533
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:50,720
which means
she'll be expensive.

534
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:53,560
If she's right,
I'll pay in silver.

535
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:55,159
How much?

536
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:56,800
Ten pieces. Half now.

537
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:58,479
(LAUGHS) Six, no more.

538
00:29:58,479 --> 00:29:59,759
Eight, and I'll make her
my finest.

539
00:29:59,759 --> 00:30:04,159
Eight. And if
she's not your finest,
you'll be her first.

540
00:30:04,159 --> 00:30:05,400
Hmm.

541
00:30:09,759 --> 00:30:14,239
I want this stone
set into the handle.

542
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:20,800
That can be done.

543
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:23,519

-You stand too close, girl.
-ALFRED: Yes, just a little.

546
00:30:44,759 --> 00:30:46,800
To take away the taste
of the gruel.

547
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:49,159
You stand too close.

548
00:30:49,319 --> 00:30:52,119
It is broth, not gruel.

549
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:52,720
Is it?

550
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:55,119
(LAUGHS) Well, I think it is.

551
00:30:55,119 --> 00:30:57,319
You should be thanking God
for its goodness

552
00:30:57,319 --> 00:31:00,319
and the banishment
of those awful cramps.

553
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:02,039
I am happy to eat as you eat.

554
00:31:02,039 --> 00:31:03,239
Ah, well, you are saintly,
my dear.

555
00:31:03,239 --> 00:31:07,280

join us for breakfast.
I dare you.

556
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:09,479
Alas, My Lord,
I've already eaten.

557
00:31:09,479 --> 00:31:10,800
Ah, you're fortunate.

558
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:14,319
Bad news, Lord.
Uh, your nephew, Aethelwold.

559
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:15,200
AELSWITH: Isn't it always?

560
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:18,200
He's drunk, he's sleeping
in the palace gardens.

561
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:19,759
Should I take him to the king?

562
00:31:19,759 --> 00:31:21,479
It's the second time
this week.

563
00:31:21,479 --> 00:31:25,400

down, painfully.

00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:53,280

I demand that this...
This bear is punished.

577
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:03,239
Aethelwold, your years
do not hide the fact
that you are a disappointment.

578
00:32:03,239 --> 00:32:03,680
May I ask why?

579
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:08,239
That you need to ask
tells your father
all he needs to know.

580
00:32:08,239 --> 00:32:11,600
-What?
-That you are
an unsuitable heir,

581
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:13,239
that is what.

582
00:32:15,639 --> 00:32:17,319
Then I will change.

583
00:32:17,759 --> 00:32:18,800
-You should!
-I will.

584
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:23,680
Look, all I ask is that
you become a man, and quickly.

585
00:32:24,479 --> 00:32:26,079
Today.

586
00:32:26,479 --> 00:32:29,239
Today. I promise.

587
00:32:35,479 --> 00:32:37,400
Am I excused?

588
00:32:44,239 --> 00:32:45,600
My Lords.

589
00:32:49,319 --> 00:32:52,119
I'm not convinced
he is my son.

590
00:32:52,119 --> 00:32:57,560
If his mother were not
already dead, I'd have her
beheaded for adultery.

If I'm to fall in the battles
that will come,

593
00:33:06,519 --> 00:33:08,519
he cannot be king.

does not tie him to his bed

of my brother.

Alfred is my heir.

599

He knows it.

600
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:30,400
And when the time comes,
Odda, my friend,

601
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:34,439
you must steer the Witan
to make this choice.

602
00:33:36,039 --> 00:33:37,400
My Lord.

603
00:33:43,039 --> 00:33:44,639
It's done.

604
00:33:44,639 --> 00:33:49,200
Should be safe for now.
They say Danes
rarely come here.

What did Storri say to you
to make you bind
his mouth and, uh...

606
00:33:54,319 --> 00:33:56,039
He threw a curse.

607

Saying what?

608
00:33:57,759 --> 00:33:59,360
It's not important.

You know what I'm doing.

of his curse with a kiss.

If you want to go
to the Danes, then go.

from Ragnar's death.

He has taken his place
and is Earl Kjartan now.
A great lord, with ships.

Whatever I discover about
my enemies is written down.

796
00:46:37,560 --> 00:46:40,239
It is in Kjartan's interest
to kill you, is it not?

797
00:46:40,239 --> 00:46:44,519
He would not want Ragnar's son
to hear a different tale.

798
00:46:44,519 --> 00:46:47,280
He would not wish him
to hear the truth, no.

801
00:46:49,720 --> 00:46:51,680
although he himself
has now travelled north,

802
00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:56,200
he has sent men to Mercia,
asking of your whereabouts.

come by all of this?

00:47:10,159 --> 00:47:15,319

all kingdoms will become one,

gathered an army.

They gather where?

00:48:39,600 --> 00:48:42,280
They have moved upriver
from Lundene to Readingum.

836
00:48:42,280 --> 00:48:43,560
They are settling as we speak.

837
00:48:43,560 --> 00:48:46,319
But you said Ubba
is in the north,
so who leads them?

838
00:48:46,319 --> 00:48:48,439
The earl Guthrum leads them.

839
00:48:48,439 --> 00:48:50,400

show you something.

I have shown them
to Alfred. He...

870

He knows you are
the Ealdorman by right.

I will continue
to keep them safe.
But, Uhtred, you...

872
00:50:30,680 --> 00:50:34,039
You must behave
like an Ealdorman.

873
00:50:42,039 --> 00:50:45,239
The charters have no meaning.
Northumbria belongs
to the Danes.

874

belong to the Danes,
it has been stolen by them.

you take it!
You can't ignore what's true.

I'll go to Readingum.

00:50:54,600 --> 00:50:57,039
-What?
-For what purpose?

878
00:50:57,039 --> 00:50:57,639
UHTRED: Knowledge.

879
00:50:57,639 --> 00:51:00,639
BEOCCA: But we have knowledge,
and you should stay away
from the Danes.

880
00:51:00,639 --> 00:51:01,519
For new knowledge.

881
00:51:01,519 --> 00:51:04,239
You know where
they're settling,
but you don't know why.

882
00:51:04,239 --> 00:51:06,439
BEOCCA: We know their number
and their position.

883
00:51:06,439 --> 00:51:10,439
Not their intention.
Am I a prisoner?

884
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:14,039
Their intention is to attack.

885
00:51:14,519 --> 00:51:16,000
When?

886
00:51:16,239 --> 00:51:17,720
Spring. It's always spring.

887
00:51:17,720 --> 00:51:20,159
I'll go to Readingum.
Where is it?

888
00:51:20,159 --> 00:51:22,360
-BEOCCA: It's too dangerous.
-Not for me.

889
00:51:22,360 --> 00:51:24,239
I'm a godless Dane, remember?

890
00:51:24,239 --> 00:51:25,439
BRIDA: So, why spy for Alfred?

891
00:51:25,439 --> 00:51:28,600
Because he is
an Ealdorman of England.

892
00:51:36,360 --> 00:51:37,720
(DOOR OPENING)

893
00:51:38,479 --> 00:51:39,720
-BEOCCA: Lord.
-(DOOR CLOSING)

894
00:51:39,720 --> 00:51:43,800
Regarding the conversion
of the pagans to Christianity.

895
00:51:43,800 --> 00:51:44,639
Yes, Lord?

896
00:51:44,639 --> 00:51:47,239
How do we decide
what is proper?

897
00:51:47,239 --> 00:51:50,200
To enlighten them
or to kill them?

898
00:51:50,200 --> 00:51:50,639
(EXHALES)

899
00:51:50,639 --> 00:51:54,079
Spreading God's word is,
of course, our mission,

900
00:51:54,079 --> 00:51:57,560
but I fear that the pagans,
the true pagans,

901
00:51:57,560 --> 00:52:01,800
must first witness
and feel His power.

902
00:52:09,119 --> 00:52:11,360
Uhtred, uh, will return?

903
00:52:11,360 --> 00:52:12,079
Yes, he will return.

904
00:52:12,079 --> 00:52:14,119
Yes, but how will he return?
As who? As what?

905
00:52:14,119 --> 00:52:18,280
-I know this boy.
-Ah, no, this boy
is now a man.

906
00:52:19,479 --> 00:52:20,319
I know his soul.

907
00:52:20,319 --> 00:52:22,039
Father Beocca, he has no soul.

908
00:52:22,039 --> 00:52:28,039
And you say yourself,
the pagans need to feel
the power of God.

909
00:52:28,039 --> 00:52:30,600
It is written now, here.

910
00:52:31,159 --> 00:52:33,039
You may leave me.

911
00:52:33,039 --> 00:52:37,200
We shall see
what the days bring,
My Lord.

912
00:52:59,119 --> 00:53:01,360
If resting through the winter
was their intention,

913
00:53:01,360 --> 00:53:04,239
they would have remained
in Lundene, yes?

914
00:53:05,200 --> 00:53:06,600
It's you who's Alfred's spy.

915
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:08,000
The next step
is to kill for him.

916
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:09,159
-Will you do that?
-Answer me this.

917
00:53:09,159 --> 00:53:13,200
If we were to cross this river
and find Guthrum,
what would happen?

918
00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:14,720
He'd kill us both.

919
00:53:14,720 --> 00:53:16,479
We owe them nothing.

920
00:53:16,479 --> 00:53:19,800
Alfred needs to know about
the Danes, and I need
to win his trust!

921
00:53:19,800 --> 00:53:24,319
You think he'll deliver
you Bebbanburg.
What if you're wrong?

922
00:53:25,039 --> 00:53:27,119
(FOOTSTEPS RECEDING)

923
00:53:41,800 --> 00:53:44,839
Alfred, you have
called council.
For what reason?

924
00:53:44,839 --> 00:53:46,280
Lord, forgive me, it may well
be for no good reason,

925
00:53:46,280 --> 00:53:51,479
but we have a pagan in court
who claims to have knowledge,
regarding the Dane army.

926
00:53:51,479 --> 00:53:51,800
Pagan?

927
00:53:51,800 --> 00:53:56,560
Forgive me, Lord,
he is Uhtred of Bebbanburg.
I vouch for his word.

928
00:53:57,560 --> 00:53:59,119
Uhtred!

929
00:54:00,759 --> 00:54:02,159
Lord.

930
00:54:05,159 --> 00:54:05,759
I've been to Readingum.

931
00:54:05,759 --> 00:54:08,560
I have watched the Danes.
Their intention
is not to settle.

932
00:54:08,560 --> 00:54:11,000
If it were, they would've
remained in Lundene.

933
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:14,400
You are saying what,
that they intend to attack?

934
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:15,000
I am, Lord.

935
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:16,519
We already know this.
Come spring, they'll be
at our door.

936
00:54:16,519 --> 00:54:18,319
They'll be marching
within days, Lord,
I'm sure of it.

937
00:54:18,319 --> 00:54:21,319
How can you possibly be
sure of it? The ground is
sodden all around,

938
00:54:21,319 --> 00:54:22,639
-it makes no sense.
-They made their sacrifices.

939
00:54:22,639 --> 00:54:25,680
The ordinary warriors,
they've caught and killed
birds, jackdaws.

940
00:54:25,680 --> 00:54:28,560
This is only done
in the days before battle.

941
00:54:28,560 --> 00:54:29,280
And they are hungry.

942
00:54:29,319 --> 00:54:30,800
Then perhaps they have eaten
these jackdaws.

943
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:33,360
They've many hundreds
of men and horses,
and few supplies.

944
00:54:33,360 --> 00:54:36,479
They'll first seize a town
rich with grain and livestock.

945
00:54:36,479 --> 00:54:38,759
I do not know the country
well, but I have travelled.

946
00:54:38,759 --> 00:54:41,360
I believe Abbendum
is such a place.

947
00:54:41,360 --> 00:54:46,560
To defeat the Danes,
you must meet them
on the road to Abbendum.

948
00:54:47,119 --> 00:54:48,759
It will be
within days, Lord.

949
00:54:48,759 --> 00:54:51,039
ALFRED: You went
to Readingum alone?

950
00:54:51,039 --> 00:54:52,400
With Brida.

951
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:54,200
Why alone?

952
00:54:54,519 --> 00:54:54,839
Why not?

953
00:54:54,839 --> 00:54:56,720
Well, because for most of
your life, you have lived
as a Dane.

954
00:54:56,720 --> 00:54:59,720
You look like a Dane,
you can speak the language
of a Dane,

955
00:54:59,720 --> 00:55:03,200
therefore, I surmise you can
set a trap like a Dane.

956
00:55:03,200 --> 00:55:05,600
Agreed, My Lord.
He imagines we are jackdaws.

957
00:55:05,600 --> 00:55:07,759
AETHELRED: Where on the road
to Abbendum?

958
00:55:07,759 --> 00:55:09,079
Where would you choose
to meet their army?

959
00:55:09,079 --> 00:55:11,400
I would choose the place
called Asec's Hill, Lord.

960
00:55:11,400 --> 00:55:12,759
You would choose
or Guthrum would choose?

961
00:55:12,759 --> 00:55:16,319
I've seen it.
The pass narrows,
you cannot be outflanked.

962
00:55:16,319 --> 00:55:18,439
For the Danes to fight uphill,
it will be difficult,

963
00:55:18,439 --> 00:55:21,639
but they'll be confident.
They don't fear West Saxons.

964
00:55:21,639 --> 00:55:24,000
Why? Why do they not fear us?

965
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:27,560
They believe you to
be farmers, nothing more.

966
00:55:27,560 --> 00:55:29,680
So, even with the sun
in their eyes,
which is possible,

967
00:55:29,680 --> 00:55:33,280
they will climb the hill
to fight, and that can be
to our advantage.

968
00:55:33,280 --> 00:55:35,200
YOUNG ODDA:
"To our advantage", he says.

969
00:55:35,200 --> 00:55:36,680
You've been here
for a matter of days,

970
00:55:36,720 --> 00:55:38,439
and already you claim
to be of Wessex.

971
00:55:38,439 --> 00:55:41,239
This is nonsense. This is all
far too convenient, My Lord.

972
00:55:41,239 --> 00:55:44,759
-I, for one, cannot...
-My Lord, my sword was made
by a Saxon smith.

973
00:55:44,759 --> 00:55:45,519
My sword is for Wessex.

974
00:55:45,519 --> 00:55:47,720
-Do not interrupt a noble
when he is speaking.
-AETHELRED: Odda.

975
00:55:47,720 --> 00:55:51,079
-I believe this man and this
bag of rags to be imposters.
-Odda...

976
00:55:51,079 --> 00:55:53,280
No army marches
as winter approaches, never.

977
00:55:53,280 --> 00:55:56,119
Young Odda,
enough from you now!

978
00:55:57,479 --> 00:55:59,079
My Lord.

979
00:56:03,400 --> 00:56:04,680
You.

980
00:56:05,280 --> 00:56:09,680
You've spoken and given
this council much to discuss.

981
00:56:09,680 --> 00:56:11,280
My Lord.

982
00:56:12,680 --> 00:56:16,519
Alfred, he's here at your
invitation. What now?

983
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:21,039
Should the Danes march,
we must face them...

984
00:56:21,039 --> 00:56:25,680
And I would rather be
at the top of a hill
than on the flat.

985
00:56:26,200 --> 00:56:29,280
I say we march to Asec's Hill.

986
00:56:31,119 --> 00:56:32,439
But...

987
00:56:34,200 --> 00:56:35,439
Take him.

988
00:56:35,439 --> 00:56:37,439
Take them both,
make them secure.

989
00:56:37,439 --> 00:56:39,079
