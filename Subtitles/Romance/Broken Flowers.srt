698
01:05:06,716 --> 01:05:09,207
So, you're an animal psychic?

699
01:05:09,285 --> 01:05:12,277
No.
I'm a communicator.

700
01:05:13,356 --> 01:05:15,756
And you're a doctor now?
Mmm.

701
01:05:17,293 --> 01:05:20,888
When we were together,
you were so passionate
about becoming a lawyer.

702
01:05:20,964 --> 01:05:22,955
I mean, you were...

703
01:05:24,434 --> 01:05:26,368
very passionate.

704
01:05:26,436 --> 01:05:30,202
Yeah, well,
passion's a funny thing.

705
01:05:32,275 --> 01:05:34,709
I have a doctorate
in animal behavior.

706
01:05:34,777 --> 01:05:38,474
But that was
sort of after the fact.

707
01:05:39,983 --> 01:05:41,974
It's an odd story.

708
01:05:43,286 --> 01:05:45,777
I'm getting into odd stories.

709
01:05:45,855 --> 01:05:49,382
[Sighs]
Well, I was a very successful lawyer.

710
01:05:50,927 --> 01:05:53,361
I had no life, though,
outside my work,

711
01:05:53,429 --> 01:05:56,125
except for my dog,
Winston.

712
01:05:58,401 --> 01:06:00,892
Your dog's named Winston?

713
01:06:02,138 --> 01:06:04,072
Yes.

714
01:06:04,140 --> 01:06:06,074
But then he died...

715
01:06:06,142 --> 01:06:08,133
suddenly.

716
01:06:09,646 --> 01:06:12,581
I'm sorry.
Oh, no.
It was, uh-

717
01:06:12,649 --> 01:06:14,583
It was years ago.

718
01:06:14,651 --> 01:06:17,950
But my new ability was this gift.

719
01:06:19,489 --> 01:06:21,480
This gift from Winston.

720
01:06:39,442 --> 01:06:42,104
All right,
you can come in again.

721
01:06:47,483 --> 01:06:49,417
Anyway,

722
01:06:49,485 --> 01:06:52,352
after Winston died
I got this gift.

723
01:06:52,422 --> 01:06:54,856
To-

724
01:06:54,924 --> 01:06:57,222
To read animals' minds?
No. I told you-

725
01:06:57,293 --> 01:07:00,626
- No.
- I'm a communicator.

726
01:07:02,732 --> 01:07:05,565
You see,
soon after Winston died...

727
01:07:06,803 --> 01:07:10,398
I realized that I could
hear animals speak to me.

728
01:07:10,473 --> 01:07:15,035
I mean, I certainly hadn't
been aware of that before.

729
01:07:15,111 --> 01:07:17,272
And I don't
read animals' minds.

730
01:07:17,347 --> 01:07:20,077
But when they want
to communicate,

731
01:07:20,149 --> 01:07:22,743
I can hear them.

732
01:07:22,819 --> 01:07:25,287
You know,
like you and I are talking.

733
01:07:25,355 --> 01:07:28,586
But we don't
read each other's minds.

734
01:07:33,329 --> 01:07:35,763
Is he saying something?

735
01:07:44,340 --> 01:07:46,831
He says
you have a hidden agenda.

736
01:07:47,877 --> 01:07:51,506
He- He said that?

737
01:07:53,649 --> 01:07:56,117
I think you'd better
go back outside now, Ramon.

738
01:08:04,694 --> 01:08:06,628
Animals can tell us
what they want,

739
01:08:06,696 --> 01:08:10,689
but that doesn't mean
that that's what's best for them.

can't keep Skippy waiting.

745

Do you think you could tell Skippy
that you're just gonna walk me to my car?

Wanna get a drink?

No.
