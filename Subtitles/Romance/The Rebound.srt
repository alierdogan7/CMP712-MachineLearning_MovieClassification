1
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:48,801
Every fucking morning.

2
00:00:49,002 --> 00:00:50,702
-- I heard that.
-- No, you didn't.

3
00:00:50,769 --> 00:00:52,497
-- Yes I did.
-- I did too.

4
00:00:54,668 --> 00:00:56,668
Hey, Sandy, what the hell.

5
00:00:56,989 --> 00:01:00,393
-- Mom!
-- It's just for germs, they're for enemy.

6
00:01:00,394 --> 00:01:03,789
-- Good luck in your test.
-- And I need luck.

7
00:01:06,254 --> 00:01:08,272
--  [Mumbles], Mom.
-- I'm sorry.

8
00:01:08,833 --> 00:01:13,887
Have a great day.
And remember, own your own power.

9
00:01:13,888 --> 00:01:16,241
Powerful Frank can learn.

10
00:01:17,608 --> 00:01:18,987
Sorry.

11
00:01:19,059 --> 00:01:21,538
Don't forget to bring the DVD for my birthday.

12
00:01:21,573 --> 00:01:24,372
I told Lizzie she's not bringing it for show and tell tomorrow.

13
00:01:24,407 --> 00:01:28,485
-- Do I ever forget anything?
-- Just do it! Ok, Mom?

14
00:01:30,371 --> 00:01:32,371
Go!

15
00:02:33,626 --> 00:02:37,410
Welcome to the Frank Magic Jr.
6th birthday celebration.

16
00:02:37,445 --> 00:02:40,537
- We have many famous guests. famous. -Well, we're here.

17
00:02:44,269 --> 00:02:45,969
Cute.

18
00:03:18,058 --> 00:03:20,296
Yeah, that's it.

19
00:03:22,124 --> 00:03:24,256
 Oh, Molly, Molly. </ i>

20
00:03:24,365 --> 00:03:26,139
Molly Foster?!

21
00:03:26,174 --> 00:03:29,766
 You're a magician. </ i>
 A little magician. </ i>

22
00:03:31,779 --> 00:03:34,325
Doing Sandy a nice favor.

23
00:03:41,612 --> 00:03:44,012
 Molly. Yes, Molly. </ I>

24
00:03:45,512 --> 00:03:47,624
Oh, my God!

25
00:03:52,554 --> 00:03:55,464
Mom I don't understand why
we have to move into the city?

26
00:03:56,910 --> 00:04:01,166
The city is the center of everything honey
It will be a fresh start.

27
00:04:01,201 --> 00:04:05,847
Dad said that only minority ventured
Capitalists live in the city.

28
00:04:05,848 --> 00:04:07,448
And now we do too.

29
00:04:26,725 --> 00:04:28,535
Are we gonna meet any transvestite?

30
00:04:28,629 --> 00:04:30,167
What is transvestite?

31
00:04:30,202 --> 00:04:33,339
It is a person who has a penis
and a vagina and they live in the city.

32
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:35,540
That's not what it is.

33
00:04:35,677 --> 00:04:38,856
Okay, guys, it's the place.

34
00:04:39,137 --> 00:04:41,073
I really have to pee.

35
00:04:41,108 --> 00:04:43,504
Can you hold it a little longer?

36
00:04:44,224 --> 00:04:45,966
Welcome to New York City.

37
00:04:46,144 --> 00:04:48,561
We're only here because
our parents are getting a divorce.

38
00:04:48,601 --> 00:04:51,039
stop smiling or
I'm taking you to Oprah.

39
00:04:51,074 --> 00:04:52,853
-- Sadie.
-- You know I've read about this.

40
00:04:53,088 --> 00:04:56,337
It's fairly typical behavior for
children of divorced.

41
00:04:56,472 --> 00:04:58,520
How about taking the bags?

42
00:04:58,555 --> 00:05:01,958
Mommy, check this out! We're
writing our names.

43
00:05:02,459 --> 00:05:04,359
Oh God!

44
00:05:08,556 --> 00:05:10,824
You can't move around for
the rest of your life.

45
00:05:11,539 --> 00:05:15,117
It's only been three weeks, mom.
Give me some time.

46
00:05:15,152 --> 00:05:17,354
Oh, such a smart girl.

47
00:05:17,389 --> 00:05:21,335
She never graduated college,
and you hated her.

48
00:05:21,370 --> 00:05:24,428
But the French, she spoke it so beautiful.

49
00:05:24,463 --> 00:05:25,911
She was from there.

50
00:05:25,946 --> 00:05:30,124
She was a Finklestein,
It is hard not to love a Finklestein.

51
00:05:30,459 --> 00:05:33,721
Anyway, I spoke to your cousin Lou,
and she arranged a job interview,

52
00:05:33,756 --> 00:05:36,591
Women's Center, where she used to work,
Get you out of your punk.

53
00:05:36,626 --> 00:05:39,113
I have a job,
at the coffee shop.

54
00:05:39,348 --> 00:05:42,344
Oh, it's depressing and you're a college graduate, Aram,
for crying out loud.

55
00:05:42,373 --> 00:05:46,216
You'll finally put that Ladies Studies major of yours
to good use.

56
00:05:46,351 --> 00:05:49,471
It's a minor, Dad
and it's called sociology.

57
00:05:49,806 --> 00:05:53,460
BA from Stanford
Journalism from Northwestern.

58
00:05:53,561 --> 00:05:57,085
You do realize that it's
just a stat checking job?

59
00:05:57,320 --> 00:06:00,772
I've been raising two kids, and

60
00:06:03,173 --> 00:06:05,324
I'm divorced.

61
00:06:06,272 --> 00:06:10,601
And I'm sure I'll be good at this
because I'm very organized.

62
00:06:12,571 --> 00:06:16,750
I love sports,
well not hockey, so much.

63
00:06:17,296 --> 00:06:21,851
You see, once the kids were born
I decided to stay home for a while.

64
00:06:22,379 --> 00:06:26,707
Coz you know, babies
take up a lot of time.

65
00:06:27,678 --> 00:06:30,625
Maybe you don't know.

66
00:06:30,744 --> 00:06:35,009
Anyway, eventually they went to school

67
00:06:35,210 --> 00:06:37,963
and I started having a little time in my hands.

68
00:06:38,077 --> 00:06:41,251
And compiled these
stat books,

69
00:06:41,286 --> 00:06:44,281
and made up this graphing system.

70
00:06:44,382 --> 00:06:45,882
Yeah, hmm.

71
00:07:02,176 --> 00:07:03,495
How?

72
00:07:03,530 --> 00:07:07,330
It's time, and a great
satellite TV package.

73
00:07:08,608 --> 00:07:13,675
Aram Finklestein, that's
a Jewish name, right?

74
00:07:19,796 --> 00:07:22,801
What are your feelings
about women, Aram?

75
00:07:23,566 --> 00:07:25,963
Are you kidding?
I think you're great up until...

76
00:07:26,698 --> 00:07:31,576
Recently I was planning on spending the rest
of my life with a woman.

77
00:07:33,054 --> 00:07:37,273
Not that I wanted to spend it
with a man, I just ...

78
00:07:37,808 --> 00:07:40,580
One experience with a woman,

79
00:07:42,933 --> 00:07:48,903
kinda took away my faith in love, and I guess, everything.

80
00:07:50,821 --> 00:07:55,341
Aram, I know you took some Women's studies
courses in College.

81
00:07:55,376 --> 00:07:58,906
But other than that, do you have any kind of experience

82
00:07:58,907 --> 00:08:01,730
that you think might have prepared you for this job?

83
00:08:05,413 --> 00:08:09,397
I used to buy
tampons for my mother.

84
00:08:09,949 --> 00:08:14,038
You will fit in perfectly, yes.

85
00:08:16,346 --> 00:08:18,905
I have met my soul mate.

86
00:08:19,247 --> 00:08:23,210
You met a really hot French girl
who needed a green card.

87
00:08:23,469 --> 00:08:25,624
-- She was so ...
-- Hot.

88
00:08:25,659 --> 00:08:27,706
-- She wasn't that.
-- Sexy.

89
00:08:27,741 --> 00:08:30,818
It was something else. She needed me.

90
00:08:30,853 --> 00:08:32,690
Yes, to get a green card.

91
00:08:32,725 --> 00:08:36,790
There's gotta be more meaning
to it than all of this.

92
00:08:36,825 --> 00:08:41,739
You know living at your parents' place isn't
exactly ... grab a life by the balls you know.

93
00:08:41,774 --> 00:08:43,470
I'm saving up.

94
00:08:43,505 --> 00:08:48,523
I hate to tell you this but ...
you work in a coffee shop.

95
00:08:49,261 --> 00:08:51,880
And your hot French wife
left you for her brother.

96
00:08:51,988 --> 00:08:53,391
 Stop it. </ i>

97
00:08:53,930 --> 00:08:55,633
Can I get you something?

98
00:08:56,141 --> 00:08:59,301
Yeah, this ad says...
you have an apartment for rent?

99
00:08:59,336 --> 00:09:00,734
Yet, ours have a ...

100
00:09:01,335 --> 00:09:04,533
Which I would be happy to show you.

101
00:09:06,234 --> 00:09:07,534
-- Sure.
-- Cool.

102
00:09:08,535 --> 00:09:10,135
[Whispering].

103
00:09:10,269 --> 00:09:13,114
I'm Mitchell, and this right here is Aram.

104
00:09:13,149 --> 00:09:15,530
He's trying to figure out the meaning of life.

105
00:09:15,565 --> 00:09:20,118
He also is a wonderful babysitter
if you ever need one.

106
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:22,840
Just a break of the apartment.

107
00:09:22,875 --> 00:09:25,774
-- Hey, little guys.
-- Mama, I do not want to live here.

108
00:09:25,809 --> 00:09:29,136
-- I want my room.
-- How many more apartment are we going to look at?

109
00:09:34,827 --> 00:09:37,724
-- I got an apartment.
-- You're fast.

110
00:09:38,412 --> 00:09:42,330
It's not great, but my husband
won't be there so that's a plus.

111
00:09:42,365 --> 00:09:44,601
How are you so well adjusted?

112
00:09:44,636 --> 00:09:47,955
All those years with the PTA, I don't have a choose.

113
00:09:47,990 --> 00:09:49,729
How's the job search?

114
00:09:49,764 --> 00:09:52,496
I got one, fact check for SNN.

115
00:09:52,531 --> 00:09:56,319
You are unbelievable, you're almost fully healed.

116
00:09:56,354 --> 00:10:00,599
You know everyone says what a nightmare it is to get divorced
you're bad, I feel good.

117
00:10:01,265 --> 00:10:02,966
No residual or anything?

118
00:10:03,726 --> 00:10:06,288
This is the best thing
that ever happened to me.

119
00:10:06,623 --> 00:10:08,811
Trapped in some suburban hell, same thing

120
00:10:08,846 --> 00:10:11,804
day after day like a
"hamster in a wheel.

121
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:13,538
Up on your feet, let's ride to happiness.

122
00:10:13,573 --> 00:10:17,047
All you need now to
complete the healing is to get laid.

123
00:10:17,082 --> 00:10:19,709
Oh no, that's one thing
I'm not ready for.

124
00:10:19,744 --> 00:10:21,829
Look I don't expect you
to fall in love with this guy.

125
00:10:23,549 --> 00:10:27,066
This guy?
Oh, no! What have you done?

126
00:10:27,101 --> 00:10:30,138
A chiropractor, who fixed me up with
that whole elevator shaft thing.

127
00:10:30,173 --> 00:10:33,826
Anyway, he smells great, and went
to an Ivy League College.

128
00:10:33,861 --> 00:10:35,840
-- Where?
-- Santa Barbara.

129
00:10:35,875 --> 00:10:37,505
That's not Ivy League.

130
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:39,807
Well, he's in great shape,
and he has a country house.

131
00:10:39,842 --> 00:10:41,363
And I already told him all about you.

132
00:10:41,398 --> 00:10:44,566
Wait, I think that's the kid
who showed me the apartment.

133
00:10:44,601 --> 00:10:46,502
The one that tried to kiss you?

134
00:10:46,537 --> 00:10:49,342
No, he just works
in the coffee shop right below.

135
00:10:49,377 --> 00:10:52,193
-- Too bad, he's cute.
-- Yeah like 10.

136
00:10:52,228 --> 00:10:54,179
Nice ass, Coffee boy.

137
00:10:59,690 --> 00:11:02,094
Just go out with my
chiropractor, and have a good time

138
00:11:02,129 --> 00:11:05,405
maybe screw him, you know, that's seems right.

139
00:11:09,011 --> 00:11:12,852
Why are you here?
It's been three weeks.

140
00:11:13,095 --> 00:11:14,595
I came to see you.

141
00:11:41,137 --> 00:11:43,226
Have fun.

142
00:11:43,261 --> 00:11:46,898
There's this huge kid,
and he has like so much fat on him.

143
00:11:46,933 --> 00:11:51,497
He sat at me at gym class,
and told me who would changed my name to Pablo.

144
00:11:51,532 --> 00:11:55,779
-- Frankie, that is terrible, are you okay sweetie?.
-- it's Pablo.

145
00:11:55,814 --> 00:11:57,209
and yes, it was fun.

146
00:11:57,244 --> 00:11:59,859
-- So, listen ...
-- Oh, uh.

147
00:11:59,894 --> 00:12:02,720
-- What?
-- Whenever you say, "So, listen,"

148
00:12:02,755 --> 00:12:04,358
is always something strange.

149
00:12:04,393 --> 00:12:07,636
It's not weird, it's just that I'm 
thinking about going on a date.

150
00:12:08,171 --> 00:12:10,348
I don't know, what I really want to but I,

151
00:12:10,383 --> 00:12:13,423
I think it will be a positive step for me..

152
00:12:14,199 --> 00:12:16,312
But I just wanted to see how you guys would feel about it..

153
00:12:16,347 --> 00:12:18,012
Are you gonna have sex with them?

154
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:19,735
That's an inappropiate question..

155
00:12:25,664 --> 00:12:30,597
Hey guys, you know, if we're gonna live in the city,

156
00:12:30,632 --> 00:12:33,178
we're gonna have to learn to deal with these kind of stuff ok.

157
00:12:34,213 --> 00:12:37,257
So just stick with me and be polite.

158
00:12:43,025 --> 00:12:45,420
-- Hello
-- Hi

159
00:12:48,711 --> 00:12:50,685
Thanks you for coming in on such short notice.

160
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:52,428
I won't normally put you on this type of situation,

161
00:12:52,463 --> 00:12:55,354
without some training,
but we're really in a vine.

162
00:12:55,389 --> 00:12:58,491
-- Whatever I can do to help.
-- Ok, great, now why don't you put your suit on.

163
00:12:58,526 --> 00:13:00,112
And then meet me at the activities room.

164
00:13:00,147 --> 00:13:02,822
-- A suit?
-- Yeah, it's in the closet behind you.

165
00:13:02,857 --> 00:13:06,781
Now try to hurry, self-defense class
starts exactly at 5:30.

166
00:13:07,075 --> 00:13:09,110
Mommy, why do you have to do this?

167
00:13:09,145 --> 00:13:13,262
Because now that we live in New York
we're gonna all kinds of different people.

168
00:13:13,297 --> 00:13:15,186
and we need to know
how to deal with them.

169
00:13:15,221 --> 00:13:16,977
Like the man with the penis?

170
00:13:19,798 --> 00:13:23,696
So you're walking down the street,
and all of a sudden you hear ...

171
00:13:25,290 --> 00:13:27,997
hey, sweet lips, I like that ass.

172
00:13:28,532 --> 00:13:32,143
Hey mommy, why don't you come over here,
sit on my face ...?

173
00:13:32,583 --> 00:13:36,537
Hey, kid, how would like
to make a quick $ 100?

174
00:13:36,572 --> 00:13:40,147
-- Yes, sure.
-- No, you don't kid, you don't want that money.

175
00:13:40,546 --> 00:13:44,110
Self--preservation in
in a city of predators.

176
00:13:44,611 --> 00:13:47,411
That's what you will learn in here.

177
00:13:48,451 --> 00:13:50,756
Let's meet our perfetrator.

178
00:13:54,494 --> 00:13:56,177
Hi

179
00:14:00,944 --> 00:14:03,602
No words perf
unless they're scripted.

180
00:14:03,937 --> 00:14:05,908
Begin scenario eight.

181
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:18,229
Hey, sweet lips.

182
00:14:20,805 --> 00:14:23,047
Scenario 3.

183
00:14:25,847 --> 00:14:28,693
Hey, baby, that should be illegal.

184
00:14:35,623 --> 00:14:37,201
5.

185
00:14:37,856 --> 00:14:41,374
Mrs. Sanchez, it appears you have
a yeast infection,

186
00:14:45,302 --> 00:14:47,457
and an unbelievable set of tits.

187
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:56,701
For our last exercise,
I am going to demonstrate

188
00:14:56,736 --> 00:15:00,309
what I call, "Ocean of anger."

189
00:15:00,827 --> 00:15:03,690
Hold on, because we are about to go deep.

190
00:15:04,142 --> 00:15:06,671
All of us as
women have developed

191
00:15:06,706 --> 00:15:09,598
a reservoir of resentment and anger.

192
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:14,051
And these reservoirs put together
form an ocean,

193
00:15:14,338 --> 00:15:19,565
and this ocean is available
for all us to draw from.

194
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:24,089
It holds the collective power
of every women,

195
00:15:24,124 --> 00:15:29,077
who has ever been wronged
in an inappropriate sexual remark

196
00:15:29,269 --> 00:15:33,643
being underpaid for a
job you've done better than a man,

197
00:15:34,190 --> 00:15:37,660
ancestor who was a slave.

198
00:15:38,902 --> 00:15:43,226
Or rice picker, or simply

199
00:15:43,261 --> 00:15:45,202
lowman on the totem pole.

200
00:15:46,165 --> 00:15:51,589
A husband who has wronged you,
who has cheated and lied to you,

201
00:15:51,806 --> 00:15:55,184
or you, or you, or you.

202
00:15:55,219 --> 00:15:58,962
-- I'm a lesbian.
-- See me after class.

203
00:15:59,032 --> 00:16:04,545
All of this anger is present
in all of you, right now and always.

204
00:16:05,230 --> 00:16:07,104
I need a volunteer.

205
00:16:11,359 --> 00:16:12,912
Mom!

206
00:16:14,484 --> 00:16:16,108
Don't!

207
00:16:21,486 --> 00:16:25,063
You are going to call upon this history

208
00:16:25,098 --> 00:16:29,906
and unleash the ocean of anger on our perf.

209
00:16:29,972 --> 00:16:32,802
May I, just need a quick bathroom break?

210
00:16:32,837 --> 00:16:35,142
Zip it, perf.
Tell him to zip it.

211
00:16:37,166 --> 00:16:40,551
-- Zip it, perf.
-- Again, good, louder.

212
00:16:52,292 --> 00:16:53,752
Zip it, perf.

213
00:16:53,787 --> 00:16:57,526
Now tell him what
you wanna tell him.

214
00:17:07,336 --> 00:17:10,383
Dirty little fucking scumbag.

215
00:17:10,418 --> 00:17:14,467
take your disease riddled whore
and fuck her in hell

216
00:17:14,502 --> 00:17:16,132
for all eternity,

217
00:17:16,167 --> 00:17:18,873
May the devil burn you,

218
00:17:18,908 --> 00:17:21,926
with hot jagged metal,

219
00:17:21,927 --> 00:17:26,813
and suffocate you with mountain fury.

220
00:17:26,948 --> 00:17:29,208
Now, unleash!.

221
00:17:33,416 --> 00:17:34,810
Oh my God.

222
00:17:34,866 --> 00:17:37,092
Is there a safe word I should be aware of?

223
00:17:50,371 --> 00:17:52,003
Time out.

224
00:18:00,665 --> 00:18:04,232
My life was never gonna be this way

225
00:18:18,570 --> 00:18:20,494
It's okay.

226
00:18:28,224 --> 00:18:30,185
I know you.

227
00:18:31,359 --> 00:18:33,950
I don't see how getting beat up
by a bunch of chicks everyday

228
00:18:33,985 --> 00:18:35,712
is getting you any closer
to the meaning of his life.

229
00:18:35,747 --> 00:18:39,069
I'm helping people,
I'm contributing to the world.

230
00:18:40,231 --> 00:18:42,255
Not like an actor.

231
00:18:42,290 --> 00:18:46,576
Buddy, I reflect life back unto itself, ok?

232
00:18:46,611 --> 00:18:51,559
Thereby, taking mirror,
like a theatre mirror.

233
00:18:56,841 --> 00:19:00,192
-- Look at you.
-- Oh, it's not as bad as it feels.

234
00:19:00,227 --> 00:19:02,513
My mom was sorry she beat you up so bad.

235
00:19:02,548 --> 00:19:04,259
Thank you, Frankie.

236
00:19:04,294 --> 00:19:07,298
Don't worry about it,
your mom didn't beat me up.

237
00:19:07,299 --> 00:19:08,599
I've been going through a lot ...

238
00:19:08,633 --> 00:19:10,938
-- Can I get a blueberry muffin ...?
-- Not right now sweetheart.

239
00:19:11,102 --> 00:19:14,472
I've been going  through a lot recently
I didn't realize how much it was affecting me.

240
00:19:14,507 --> 00:19:16,562
-- Don't worry about it.
-- Just saying sorry.

241
00:19:16,597 --> 00:19:18,806
-- I pick it up.
-- I helped.

242
00:19:19,212 --> 00:19:21,804
If palm gets squezzed into it, you could die.

243
00:19:22,024 --> 00:19:24,853
I was wondering
if I could take you up on your offer

244
00:19:25,888 --> 00:19:27,432
to babysit.

245
00:19:27,909 --> 00:19:29,886
If it still holds, that is.

246
00:19:30,021 --> 00:19:32,367
I don't really ... I mean, I haven't you know in a little while ...

247
00:19:32,902 --> 00:19:35,661
I figured since they.
hired at the Women's Center,

248
00:19:35,696 --> 00:19:37,994
You must be trustworthy.

249
00:19:39,735 --> 00:19:44,511
I guess I could pop upstairs
some day after work for a couple of hours.

250
00:19:44,946 --> 00:19:46,411
Would Thursday work?

251
00:19:46,446 --> 00:19:49,056
-- She has a date.
-- With a big pimp.

252
00:19:52,073 --> 00:19:53,726
Where do you learn this stuff?

253
00:19:53,761 --> 00:19:58,265
Olivia at school taught me, she's
my hell, we play .

254
00:19:59,294 --> 00:20:01,221
What ever happened to kickball.

255
00:20:02,756 --> 00:20:05,017
Would 7 o'clock be okay?

256
00:20:06,731 --> 00:20:08,171
Oh, great.

257
00:20:13,061 --> 00:20:16,721
There are times when the lost
must be found,

258
00:20:16,756 --> 00:20:20,842
and other times when the lost
must find themselves.

259
00:20:20,877 --> 00:20:22,464
Very well said Rabbi.

260
00:20:22,599 --> 00:20:27,382
Not that he's a bad little boy
just misguided, falling in with the wrong crowd.

261
00:20:27,458 --> 00:20:31,526
Are you talking about me? I only hang out
with you and Dad?

262
00:20:31,561 --> 00:20:36,833
The battles are not only fought on
the battlefield, Roberto but also in the soul.

263
00:20:36,870 --> 00:20:39,022
My soul is fine. Great.

264
00:20:39,357 --> 00:20:41,183
What does his future hold?

265
00:20:41,218 --> 00:20:43,189
Mom, he's not a palm reader.

266
00:20:43,224 --> 00:20:45,370
A new job is in order.

267
00:20:47,405 --> 00:20:52,039
Luckily, my cousin is a head hunter
are you interested in business, Aram?

268
00:20:52,072 --> 00:20:53,805
Yes

269
00:20:53,874 --> 00:20:56,791
Kids, your babysitter's here.
Come say hello.

270
00:20:57,713 --> 00:20:59,940
Sadie usually goes to bed a bit later than Frankie,

271
00:20:59,975 --> 00:21:02,376
but due to her unscheduled
emergency surgery

272
00:21:02,411 --> 00:21:04,063
she'll be going to bed the same time. - Oh my God.

273
00:21:05,598 --> 00:21:09,617
Are you sure I should be staying with her
after she just had surgery?

274
00:21:15,557 --> 00:21:18,030
This was her surgery.

275
00:21:18,065 --> 00:21:20,715
I told you it was dead
when I found it.

276
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:23,347
Yes, but I highly doubt
its organs have been harvested.

277
00:21:23,382 --> 00:21:26,554
-- I hate you.
-- Can I play Wii?

278
00:21:26,589 --> 00:21:27,938
For half an hour.

279
00:21:31,338 --> 00:21:33,226
-- You're gonna be okay, right?
-- Yeah

280
00:21:33,373 --> 00:21:36,491
Truth is, I didn't know if I want to go on this date,

281
00:21:36,492 --> 00:21:38,609
it's just my friend, she's kinda

282
00:21:38,844 --> 00:21:41,940
forcing me. Things we need to get with.

283
00:21:44,060 --> 00:21:46,060
Release some tension.

284
00:21:48,424 --> 00:21:51,478
Do I look okay? Everything's in order.

285
00:21:52,499 --> 00:21:54,827
It seems to be.

286
00:21:58,752 --> 00:22:01,659
-- Goodbye, Frankie.
-- Bye.

287
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:10,434
-- Hey Frank.
-- Call me Pablo.

288
00:22:11,303 --> 00:22:14,768
He also had some cranial seizures as well as TMJ.

289
00:22:16,780 --> 00:22:18,547
So what did you do?

290
00:22:18,582 --> 00:22:21,556
I went right home and I took out my skeleton.

291
00:22:21,991 --> 00:22:27,105
-- Your skeleton?
-- It's really as weird as it sounds.

292
00:22:27,140 --> 00:22:31,963
I have this bone replica skeleton, keep it the house
and I use it to figure stuff out.

293
00:22:32,664 --> 00:22:36,002
This way I can put it in different positions and see how
they affect his bone structure.

294
00:22:36,343 --> 00:22:39,290
-- It's a him?
-- Yes it's him.

295
00:22:40,130 --> 00:22:42,269
Thought it would be weird if it was a her.

296
00:22:42,304 --> 00:22:46,083
That way people might think
I'm seeing somebody,

297
00:22:46,118 --> 00:22:50,404
and it might actually drive away
beautiful women like you.

298
00:22:50,445 --> 00:22:52,486
I'm a mom.

299
00:22:53,288 --> 00:22:55,316
Why did I say that?

300
00:22:55,351 --> 00:22:57,869
It's okay, it's alright, I know. It's true.

301
00:22:57,961 --> 00:23:02,824
You are a mom.
And you are incredibly beautiful.

302
00:23:02,835 --> 00:23:06,011
You have excellent posture.

303
00:23:19,804 --> 00:23:22,180
Excuse me for just a second.

304
00:23:38,741 --> 00:23:41,680
You haven't told me much about yourself. </ i>

305
00:23:41,715 --> 00:23:43,816
My God.

306
00:23:48,478 --> 00:23:51,396
-- Hello
-- I'm here.

307
00:23:51,725 --> 00:23:53,555
I thought I'd lost you for a second.

308
00:24:00,013 --> 00:24:04,468
No, I grew up just outside
San Francisco.

309
00:24:04,503 --> 00:24:07,447
 That's a great town. </ i>

310
00:24:10,121 --> 00:24:12,285
 Do you have any hobby? </ i>

311
00:24:14,577 --> 00:24:16,253
Just take care of my kids.

312
00:24:16,288 --> 00:24:19,329
 No, no, that's not </ i>

313
00:24:19,423 --> 00:24:22,813
 a hobby. </ i>

314
00:24:26,020 --> 00:24:28,206
I used to like to windsurf.

315
00:24:28,241 --> 00:24:31,496
 Longboard? Shortboard? </ i>
 Ocean, lake, what? </ i>

316
00:24:32,175 --> 00:24:34,637
Lake, mostly lake.

317
00:24:35,838 --> 00:24:38,099
I competed when I was younger.

318
00:24:45,674 --> 00:24:49,823
Competed in windsurfing,
That's impressing.

319
00:24:50,295 --> 00:24:51,713
So?

320
00:24:51,748 --> 00:24:54,295
You ..like the beautiful you, you

321
00:24:57,396 --> 00:25:01,446
You are fascinating.

322
00:25:05,525 --> 00:25:07,472
What's your normal job?

323
00:25:07,507 --> 00:25:09,877
--I work at the coffee shop.
-- I mean your real job?

324
00:25:10,704 --> 00:25:12,344
It was my real job.

325
00:25:12,379 --> 00:25:14,120
but you are in the blowup suit too.

326
00:25:14,655 --> 00:25:16,328
That was just once, I quit there.

327
00:25:16,363 --> 00:25:19,217
-- Didn't you go to college?
-- Yes

328
00:25:19,252 --> 00:25:21,959
I hope I'll have a real job
by the time I'm your age.

329
00:25:23,776 --> 00:25:25,115
Knockout!.

330
00:25:25,150 --> 00:25:27,226
The Pablo man had knocked you out.

331
00:25:28,561 --> 00:25:31,642
So are we gonna have fun tonight
or you're gonna be one of those boring babysitter?

332
00:25:32,177 --> 00:25:33,809
Hey guys, it's me.

333
00:25:33,844 --> 00:25:39,913
I don't know why you're not picking up,
Anyway, I hope everything's okay.

334
00:25:42,314 --> 00:25:44,070
Yeah, ok, bye.

335
00:25:45,170 --> 00:25:46,933
Worried about the kids, huh

336
00:25:54,451 --> 00:25:56,997
My new babysitter have not much experience yet.

337
00:25:57,432 --> 00:25:59,800
I know exactly what you need.

338
00:26:03,239 --> 00:26:06,388
See, we all hold our
tension somewhere.

339
00:26:06,923 --> 00:26:08,930
For you, it's in your shoulders,

340
00:26:11,766 --> 00:26:15,116
and just a little bit in your ass.

341
00:26:16,556 --> 00:26:18,811
There's much experience as I have ...

342
00:26:19,846 --> 00:26:23,788
can tell just by the way
as people walk ...

343
00:26:28,702 --> 00:26:30,837
and even by the way they smile.

344
00:26:39,608 --> 00:26:41,343
No charge.

345
00:26:47,477 --> 00:26:50,104
This thing got my arm.

346
00:26:52,469 --> 00:26:54,420
I'm running through the forest.

347
00:26:55,836 --> 00:26:59,655
Leave me one arm,
please don't ...

348
00:27:01,814 --> 00:27:04,969
I'll get claustrophobic wearing human skin mask.

349
00:27:05,004 --> 00:27:07,206
You couldn't even wear
a hulk mask last Halloween.

350
00:27:07,241 --> 00:27:09,727
That's because it was hot and it smelled bad.

351
00:27:09,762 --> 00:27:11,238
-- That was your breath, retard.
-- Sadie ...

352
00:27:11,273 --> 00:27:13,062
-- Actually ...
-- C'mon, you don't need to do.....

353
00:27:13,463 --> 00:27:14,763
It's 11 o'clock.

354
00:27:14,796 --> 00:27:17,754
Gotta to get you to bed
before your mom comes home.

355
00:27:20,228 --> 00:27:22,255
-- How about the  "Exorcist".
-- Okay.

356
00:27:22,356 --> 00:27:23,720
I don't feel so good.

357
00:27:23,755 --> 00:27:25,469
I might throw up.

358
00:27:27,453 --> 00:27:31,478
This chocolate bar is bigger than you
If you're gonna throw up, can't you do it before your mom gets home, please.

359
00:27:31,728 --> 00:27:34,436
I always throw up when mentioning throw up, and before a girl.

360
00:27:34,471 --> 00:27:36,686
I love throw ups.

361
00:27:36,721 --> 00:27:38,584
-- Eew, you love to eat throw up?
-- Sadie.

362
00:27:38,619 --> 00:27:39,930
What?

363
00:27:39,965 --> 00:27:43,245
You're gonna freak him out
you're getting us all in trouble.

364
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:45,377
You know actually I feels like.., Frankie?

365
00:27:45,412 --> 00:27:47,662
-- That was nice, listen
-- What?.

366
00:27:47,697 --> 00:27:51,811
Eating a raw skinned pigeon
with mustard and rotten milk,

367
00:27:51,846 --> 00:27:55,220
just chewing on those intestines and those little bones..

368
00:27:55,470 --> 00:27:57,243
Okay, off to bed, c'mon ... - Yummy

369
00:28:04,976 --> 00:28:07,009
Touch my cock.

370
00:28:09,126 --> 00:28:11,171
Stop the car.

371
00:28:16,695 --> 00:28:19,065
-- You have a problem.
-- I have a problem?

372
00:28:34,851 --> 00:28:37,327
Thanks for offering.

373
00:28:38,737 --> 00:28:40,910
I'd love to tell you.

374
00:28:43,872 --> 00:28:49,315
In a taxi. It seems like the perfect place.

375
00:28:54,122 --> 00:28:56,024
Hobby

376
00:29:03,775 --> 00:29:06,358
Home making.

377
00:29:10,562 --> 00:29:15,218
How could this happen to me?
Do you ever wonder that?

378
00:29:16,333 --> 00:29:19,111
How could I have floated so far

379
00:29:20,176 --> 00:29:24,719
off the path I thought I was on?

380
00:29:24,820 --> 00:29:27,645
I just thought maybe

381
00:29:29,579 --> 00:29:33,176
it would be some meaning to my life.

382
00:29:38,430 --> 00:29:40,492
I'm not making any sense.

383
00:29:50,574 --> 00:29:52,574
Maybe you'll come back again

384
00:29:54,518 --> 00:29:58,037
Coz I think the kids could really use some continuity.

385
00:30:00,448 --> 00:30:01,760
Shit.

386
00:30:05,105 --> 00:30:10,256
I have no fucking money, can you believe that?

387
00:30:11,207 --> 00:30:12,960
Can I pay you tomorrow?

388
00:30:14,861 --> 00:30:16,614
It's no problem.

389
00:30:24,462 --> 00:30:27,961
Hey it's you, eating a croissant.

390
00:30:28,562 --> 00:30:30,962
French chick must be fading, huh.

391
00:30:31,262 --> 00:30:33,970
-- Don't change the music.
-- What, they're shooting music..oops?

392
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:39,707
-- What do you think about kids?
-- I think about making them all the time.

393
00:30:40,779 --> 00:30:43,937
-- That's not what I'm talking about.
-- What are you talking about?

394
00:30:44,522 --> 00:30:49,793
-- I don't know, being entirely responsible
for another human being's life.

395
00:30:51,301 --> 00:30:52,984
It's crazy.

396
00:30:52,719 --> 00:30:55,104
-- Aram, aram
-- Mama's dead!

397
00:30:55,239 --> 00:30:56,871
What? -- C'mon.

398
00:31:00,691 --> 00:31:02,550
She's not dead.

399
00:31:02,585 --> 00:31:04,752
It could be postmortem twitch.

400
00:31:05,387 --> 00:31:07,522
Kids fall back.

401
00:31:14,581 --> 00:31:16,981
Hey.

402
00:31:19,192 --> 00:31:20,692
Sandy.

403
00:31:25,610 --> 00:31:28,265
It's morning.

404
00:31:37,677 --> 00:31:41,747
Oh my God, I slept with a babysitter.

405
00:31:43,090 --> 00:31:46,469
You didn't sleep with a babysitter.

406
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:48,210
We thought you were dead.

407
00:31:49,045 --> 00:31:52,665
Yeah, we thought you might have asphyxiated on your own vomit

408
00:31:55,420 --> 00:31:58,692
Aram can take us to school.
Coz we're already late.

409
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:03,538
-- Could you? --Sure

410
00:32:04,721 --> 00:32:06,931
Can you pick them up too?

411
00:32:09,826 --> 00:32:11,840
Are those stat sheets ready yet?

412
00:32:11,175 --> 00:32:12,671
Yeah, printer 4.

413
00:32:16,884 --> 00:32:20,883
Sandy, you got a minute?

414
00:32:28,287 --> 00:32:29,842
Am I fired?

415
00:32:29,577 --> 00:32:31,675
What! Why would you say that?

416
00:32:32,566 --> 00:32:34,550
Because ...

417
00:32:36,151 --> 00:32:38,234
I'm so hangover, I guess.

418
00:32:38,750 --> 00:32:41,227
I have two kids and no husband

419
00:32:42,203 --> 00:32:45,068
I haven't had a real job since graduate school. I'm so sorry

420
00:32:46,181 --> 00:32:48,198
Oh, please don't apologize.

421
00:32:48,533 --> 00:32:51,286
I was really calling you in to see
if you wanted to write for me.

422
00:32:52,398 --> 00:32:57,937
I find the guys stuff gets boring and repetitive.

423
00:32:57,972 --> 00:33:02,482
And I saw that stat book you put together, amazing.

424
00:33:02,217 --> 00:33:04,906
Clearly obsessive, reminds me of me

425
00:33:07,580 --> 00:33:09,337
Do you do yoga?

426
00:33:10,549 --> 00:33:13,356
I'll do yoga if I could win.

427
00:33:13,191 --> 00:33:15,065
I'm gonna take you some time.

428
00:33:24,228 --> 00:33:26,983
-- Thanks.
-- Hydrate.

429
00:33:30,435 --> 00:33:32,181
Cool, what's your catch phrase gonna be?

430
00:33:32,216 --> 00:33:37,401
I don't think it's gonna be like that, Frankie. I'm just gonna be writing the basis of the story and she'll fill in the flavor.

431
00:33:37,651 --> 00:33:41,095
-- What about suck it?
--  Why are you such an idiot.

432
00:33:41,130 --> 00:33:42,473
It's just an idea.

433
00:33:43,187 --> 00:33:46,118
That's really exciting though, I mean, and you can even get some airtime.

434
00:33:46,353 --> 00:33:49,156
I don't think so. -That'll be cool, mom.

435
00:33:49,191 --> 00:33:51,583
You have the face for it.

436
00:33:52,218 --> 00:33:53,999
That's a nice thing to say.

437
00:33:54,299 --> 00:33:57,371
"You have the face for it.", hmm, love you, love you, love you

438
00:33:58,525 --> 00:34:02,037
I'm just saying that your mom has a face

439
00:34:02,287 --> 00:34:05,789
to put on TV.

440
00:34:07,242 --> 00:34:12,329
I'm very together, I never
missed taking my kids to school.

441
00:34:12,764 --> 00:34:17,858
You don't have to explain anything, I promise
I know what it's like to go through a divorce.

442
00:34:17,893 --> 00:34:19,917
Are your parents divorced?

443
00:34:19,952 --> 00:34:21,927
No, I am sort of.

444
00:34:22,935 --> 00:34:25,063
You're so young.

445
00:34:25,098 --> 00:34:27,024
When do you have the time?

446
00:34:26,859 --> 00:34:28,976
It was short--lived, her name was Alice,

447
00:34:29,211 --> 00:34:33,127
she left me for her brother. He wasn't really her brother

448
00:34:33,162 --> 00:34:36,654
he was just posing as her brother so he could be close to her

449
00:34:36,689 --> 00:34:38,599
So she could use me to get a green card.

450
00:34:38,634 --> 00:34:41,976
What!? That is horrible.

451
00:34:42,511 --> 00:34:46,054
Yeah, it's pretty bad.

452
00:34:46,158 --> 00:34:50,982
The worst part about it though
is I can't bring myself to finalize the divorce

453
00:34:51,532 --> 00:34:54,716
because if I do
then she'll get kick out of the country

454
00:34:55,218 --> 00:34:56,856
That would be so cruel, you know.

455
00:34:58,372 --> 00:35:02,229
God, I wished I could get my husband kicked out of the country.

456
00:35:02,976 --> 00:35:05,281
It's that bad, huh. --Yeah

457
00:35:07,164 --> 00:35:10,852
-- So sorry.
-- Oh, no, me too, for you.

458
00:35:11,315 --> 00:35:17,025
You know, Aram this has been really hard for me

459
00:35:17,060 --> 00:35:20,144
and with a new job, there's gonna be some longer hours.

460
00:35:20,679 --> 00:35:23,365
And I was thinking, maybe you'd be willing

461
00:35:23,366 --> 00:35:27,182
to help us out on more of a full time basis.

462
00:35:28,811 --> 00:35:30,367
A nanny?

463
00:35:30,402 --> 00:35:33,939
You're not from Trinidad, you're
from the Upper West Side of Manhattan.

464
00:35:33,374 --> 00:35:35,630
Did we send you to college for this, Harry?

465
00:35:36,065 --> 00:35:38,536
You always said
you just wanted me to be happy.

466
00:35:38,371 --> 00:35:41,589
Within reason, this is not how you contribute to the world.

467
00:35:41,824 --> 00:35:44,024
Mom you work for Ralph Lauren.

468
00:35:44,159 --> 00:35:45,570
People need clothes.

469
00:35:45,105 --> 00:35:47,885
This family needs me, she just got divorced

470
00:35:48,620 --> 00:35:50,983
and she got this great job

471
00:35:50,718 --> 00:35:53,738
and she needs someone to
trust to take care of these kids..

472
00:35:55,742 --> 00:35:57,672
Mom it's not like it's forever.

473
00:35:57,707 --> 00:35:59,278
You know, I'm gonna be making money.

474
00:36:00,372 --> 00:36:01,949
-- Harry!
-- Alright,

475
00:36:01,650 --> 00:36:04,627
you're still going out on interviews for other jobs.

476
00:36:04,662 --> 00:36:08,545
And in the meantime you can't keep this for quite a while.

477
00:37:44,462 --> 00:37:48,317
Let me try it, get a job, I'm a freaking racer.

478
00:37:49,740 --> 00:37:53,790
It's not the same thing.
Coz you have to say the freaking first to make it work.

479
00:37:54,466 --> 00:37:56,164
It's much funnier with the freaking, right?

480
00:37:56,849 --> 00:37:58,726
I'm just gonna go outside and grab a smoke.

481
00:38:03,170 --> 00:38:06,475
Smoke? What are they from stone age?

482
00:38:06,710 --> 00:38:10,599
Please for some goddamn God, you got to find something wrong with every guy

483
00:38:10,849 --> 00:38:13,453
Did you see how long it takes
the guy to order a bow wine?

484
00:38:13,488 --> 00:38:17,167
His father owns a vineyard
in Napa, so he knows a lot about it.

485
00:38:16,602 --> 00:38:18,379
Like he mentioned several hundred times.

486
00:38:19,014 --> 00:38:20,853
He mentioned it once.

487
00:38:21,405 --> 00:38:23,875
Who is calling you?
You don't have a life.

488
00:38:23,710 --> 00:38:26,659
It's Aram, he taught me how to text.

489
00:38:27,594 --> 00:38:29,802
Oh my God!
What?

490
00:38:29,537 --> 00:38:31,279
--You have a thing for the nanny
-- Oh, please.

491
00:38:34,396 --> 00:38:36,207
He's just telling me that my kids are asleep.

492
00:38:38,006 --> 00:38:39,308
Kids asleep. Frank to

493
00:38:38,943 --> 00:38:41,193
Frank took two foot long poop, we measured.

494
00:38:41,943 --> 00:38:43,447
It's disgusting.

495
00:38:42,935 --> 00:38:46,967
Just keeping me in the loop and I appreciate that.

496
00:38:48,727 --> 00:38:51,479
It's very funny, sincere.

497
00:38:52,314 --> 00:38:55,758
and besides he's a lot more adult than those guys you've set me up with.

498
00:38:56,008 --> 00:38:58,160
In a 24-year old kind of way.

499
00:38:58,409 --> 00:39:01,277
-- Let me see what you wrote.
-- No, no ...you're not

500
00:39:04,016 --> 00:39:08,598
About to bail on my date, set up monopoly?

501
00:39:08,633 --> 00:39:12,629
This is pathetic. Seriously?

502
00:39:12,464 --> 00:39:13,766
Yeah

503
00:39:18,905 --> 00:39:20,464
Ok, here's the pussy.

504
00:39:22,994 --> 00:39:28,550
I would love you to meet
Sunshine and Cinnamon.

505
00:39:29,419 --> 00:39:31,328
Hi, I am Aram.

506
00:39:31,363 --> 00:39:33,795
They love talking and stuff so...

507
00:39:35,615 --> 00:39:37,998
Try to be normal, alright. Stay positive.

508
00:39:40,041 --> 00:39:41,930
-- Sorry. --Aram, hey.

509
00:39:42,725 --> 00:39:44,592
It's a weird name.

510
00:39:45,427 --> 00:39:46,919
Thank you.

511
00:39:46,854 --> 00:39:48,909
Mitch told me he is divorced.

512
00:39:49,610 --> 00:39:51,265
It's weird, huh.

513
00:39:51,700 --> 00:39:55,178
It's kinda normal to me, you know, it's my life.

514
00:39:55,313 --> 00:39:57,300
So I'm kinda used to it, I guess.

515
00:39:59,660 --> 00:40:02,486
I guess if you mean, it's unusual, then yeah.

516
00:40:03,021 --> 00:40:05,302
We'll talk a lot about this.

517
00:40:05,802 --> 00:40:07,455
I guess.

518
00:40:10,645 --> 00:40:13,028
I love theories.

519
00:40:12,863 --> 00:40:14,397
Make me a little horny.

520
00:40:17,340 --> 00:40:21,423
I think I'm gonna go.

521
00:40:31,822 --> 00:40:34,718
Hey, it's me, what are you guys doing?

522
00:40:34,053 --> 00:40:35,378
We're just playing "American Idol."

523
00:40:36,013 --> 00:40:40,635
That was truly dreadful Aram
Finklestein, awful.

524
00:40:39,970 --> 00:40:43,897
You kinda like a little pitchy in the beginning
but dawg, I mean you put it together in the end,

525
00:40:44,147 --> 00:40:45,935
and man you rocked.

526
00:40:45,985 --> 00:40:49,705
Well Randy liked it, but I still  doint' think
I'm going to the next round.

527
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:50,953
I'm not gonna be able to make it home for dinner tonight.

528
00:40:51,488 --> 00:40:54,311
Yeah, no problem.
I could feed the kids.

529
00:40:54,446 --> 00:40:56,676
You may have to put them to bed too.

530
00:40:56,511 --> 00:40:58,013
Can be a late one, huh

531
00:40:58,148 --> 00:41:00,156
Yeah, a couple of </ i>
 the Vikings player, </ i>

532
00:41:00,191 --> 00:41:02,606
were charged of sexually assaulting a stripper

533
00:41:02,541 --> 00:41:05,071
 I have to come up with something fizzy for the board to leave this. </ i>

534
00:41:05,506 --> 00:41:09,029
Well, Vikings
have been attacking people on ships for centuries now.

535
00:41:09,564 --> 00:41:12,970
Aram, that's good but thank you. I'll see when I get home okay.

536
00:41:28,565 --> 00:41:30,337
I'm sorry.

537
00:41:31,453 --> 00:41:37,363
God, I can't imagine to be many more days like this.

538
00:41:37,598 --> 00:41:40,622
No prob, there's dinner for you on the table there.

539
00:41:40,757 --> 00:41:43,753
Oh thanks, you didn't have to do that.

540
00:41:45,183 --> 00:41:48,187
Just whipped up on stuff that I learned on Top Chef

541
00:41:50,806 --> 00:41:54,392
The kids helped,
and Frank's pretty good.

542
00:41:55,243 --> 00:41:58,137
Delicious, wow, hmm...wait

543
00:41:58,653 --> 00:42:05,098
I have these two tickets for the fight
on Saturday, I thought you might be able to use them.

544
00:42:07,345 --> 00:42:09,885
Aren't the kids with their dad this weekend?

545
00:42:10,235 --> 00:42:13,232
-- Yeah -- And you don't wanna use this?

546
00:42:13,482 --> 00:42:17,602
My girlfriend's not free and I'm facing another date.

547
00:42:17,537 --> 00:42:19,844
So take whoever you want.

548
00:42:21,770 --> 00:42:24,736
--That's really nice, thanks.  --You're welcome.

549
00:42:29,153 --> 00:42:32,124
Hey, I was wondering if you are free this weekend.

550
00:42:31,659 --> 00:42:33,770
Coz I've got these tickets to the big fight.

551
00:43:13,712 --> 00:43:15,719
I hate it when the ref does that.

552
00:43:16,693 --> 00:43:20,103
Why bother having a rest, just let them bareknuckle it.

553
00:43:22,538 --> 00:43:25,482
I can't believe you were thinking of that coming.

554
00:43:24,917 --> 00:43:26,369
Me neither.

555
00:43:27,915 --> 00:43:29,685
I can never be like this with Frank

556
00:43:31,442 --> 00:43:35,634
It was like I didn't even know if I was happy when I was with him

557
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:39,162
What makes
people do that? Just coast along.

558
00:43:40,697 --> 00:43:42,492
And you know the thing that really sticks for me

559
00:43:42,742 --> 00:43:46,844
is that I never got the chance to
tell him how I felt.

560
00:43:46,976 --> 00:43:49,843
He has this strange ability,

561
00:43:51,378 --> 00:43:54,211
to make me entirely lose my voice. 

562
00:43:54,802 --> 00:43:57,112
Like some superpower, it's crazy.

563
00:43:59,515 --> 00:44:01,230
No Voice Man

564
00:44:01,265 --> 00:44:04,372
Steal You Voice Man, Quiet Man

565
00:44:05,819 --> 00:44:07,446
Dr. Silence. - That's a good one.

566
00:44:08,281 --> 00:44:10,346
Hey, Aram, right?

567
00:44:10,747 --> 00:44:12,811
Gile from Roscoe Mathis, I interviewed you.

568
00:44:13,080 --> 00:44:15,174
Oh, yeah yeah. How are you?

569
00:44:15,509 --> 00:44:20,818
Dude, you're the only person that's ever said no to us
most people would kill for that job.

570
00:44:21,468 --> 00:44:22,873
Sorry about that.

571
00:44:22,508 --> 00:44:25,900
Ringside at the fight,
doesn't look like you're doing too bad.

572
00:44:25,935 --> 00:44:28,447
Let me know if you ever change your mind.

573
00:44:30,786 --> 00:44:32,404
--Thanks. --Good to see you around.

574
00:44:35,885 --> 00:44:37,543
What?

575
00:44:37,966 --> 00:44:40,291
It's just an entry level thing.

576
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:46,368
At Roscoe Mathis? And you
let them go to be my nanny?

577
00:44:47,844 --> 00:44:49,593
Idiotic.

578
00:44:50,229 --> 00:44:53,169
I thought so too, for a minute.

579
00:44:51,818 --> 00:44:56,495
I wasn't really thinking clearly there after Alice.

580
00:44:57,854 --> 00:45:03,359
And suddenly I just had a very clear thought in my head.

581
00:45:06,285 --> 00:45:09,317
What really matters are
the people in my life.

582
00:45:09,832 --> 00:45:15,260
You and your family were, are some of those
people that make me feel good,

583
00:45:15,195 --> 00:45:19,002
make my life good, every day.

584
00:45:24,029 --> 00:45:28,777
That is the most wonderfully

585
00:45:28,127 --> 00:45:30,927
and jaded naive thing I've ever heard..

586
00:45:32,390 --> 00:45:36,825
It's rare to find
a guy who's such a romantic.

587
00:46:06,979 --> 00:46:08,517
Bright light.

588
00:46:13,372 --> 00:46:14,758
Close those eyes.

589
00:46:15,958 --> 00:46:18,141
I'm not tired. --You're really gonna sleep this off with me.

590
00:46:21,568 --> 00:46:23,075
I'm gonna put this here okay.

591
00:46:26,408 --> 00:46:27,881
I really love your kids.

592
00:46:28,950 --> 00:46:30,304
I know.

593
00:46:33,242 --> 00:46:34,733
I had fun tonight.

594
00:46:37,397 --> 00:46:39,145
Yeah...me too.

595
00:46:43,778 --> 00:46:45,654
None of you to call me that word, okay.

596
00:46:45,855 --> 00:46:48,755
It's not a weird word, though
It's just means a "female dog"..

597
00:46:49,988 --> 00:46:52,514
I'm not gonna have semantics today, okay. --What are you doing here?

598
00:46:52,386 --> 00:46:55,856
You know what it means, it's not okay to call me that or anyone else for that matter

599
00:46:56,006 --> 00:46:58,198
You've been in the city for a few months
they're already totally corrupted.

600
00:46:58,548 --> 00:47:01,966
-- Dad's play sucks.
-- Frankie, what happened?

601
00:47:01,982 --> 00:47:04,653
-- Aram!?
-- Guys, careful...

602
00:47:05,001 --> 00:47:07,614
C'mon you late night criminals

603
00:47:11,162 --> 00:47:13,836
Hey, guess what? --You wanna give me a million dollars?

604
00:47:13,486 --> 00:47:15,352
We saw a dead junk on the road.

605
00:47:15,602 --> 00:47:17,016
Oh, even better.

606
00:47:16,726 --> 00:47:19,321
We wanted to touch it but dad wouldn't let us.

607
00:47:21,766 --> 00:47:23,607
You're running a home for delinquent boys.

608
00:47:23,493 --> 00:47:25,250
Aram helps me with the kids, Frank.

609
00:47:25,890 --> 00:47:27,913
The kids weren't here, so what's he doing here?

610
00:47:27,796 --> 00:47:30,210
Can I just explain something to you?

611
00:47:30,565 --> 00:47:33,248
You have no
rights in this house, okay.

612
00:47:33,711 --> 00:47:35,289
I don't like the way this separation is going.

613
00:47:36,730 --> 00:47:38,059
Oh Really?

614
00:47:38,574 --> 00:47:43,017
Well, I'm loving the way it's going, this is exactly how I envisioned my life.

615
00:47:43,167 --> 00:47:46,039
--Noticed how weird this thing was.
-- That's mine.

616
00:47:47,273 --> 00:47:49,647
What I wanna say, it's gonna come out wrong.

617
00:47:49,713 --> 00:47:52,098
I want you back. I want our life back.

618
00:47:52,412 --> 00:47:54,038
Why are you doing this?

619
00:47:54,402 --> 00:47:57,832
The truth is I couldn't handle the kids, I just wanted to see you.

620
00:47:58,904 --> 00:48:01,797
You must missed me, at least a little.

621
00:48:04,201 --> 00:48:05,802
I don't want you here.

622
00:48:07,456 --> 00:48:08,978
Of course, I don't wanna be here.

623
00:48:09,882 --> 00:48:12,866
If you're good, I'll come back and do the grunge.

624
00:48:21,902 --> 00:48:23,787
You can even work if you wanted to.

625
00:48:24,717 --> 00:48:26,290
Part time.

626
00:48:27,317 --> 00:48:29,072
Imagine this..

627
00:48:32,637 --> 00:48:37,297
There are so many things
I wanted to say to you.

628
00:48:42,583 --> 00:48:44,736
We're not gonna need you anymore.

629
00:48:44,552 --> 00:48:47,434
Unless you wanna grab a bite to eat and you can sit, are you on hourly?

630
00:48:47,384 --> 00:48:50,956
I think Sandy had something that she wanted to say to you.

631
00:48:53,327 --> 00:48:54,772
Didn't you?

632
00:49:04,286 --> 00:49:09,630
I just wanted to tell you about some feelings I've been having

633
00:49:13,066 --> 00:49:14,452
you know

634
00:49:16,424 --> 00:49:19,095
regarding you and your treatment with me.

635
00:49:22,955 --> 00:49:25,175
What she wanted to say was...

636
00:49:25,362 --> 00:49:30,420
and, this is pretty much, word for word, if I remember properly

637
00:49:30,931 --> 00:49:35,106
that you're a dirty little fucking scumbag

638
00:49:35,640 --> 00:49:40,718
and I might be paraphrasing here, but you should

639
00:49:40,537 --> 00:49:45,974
take your diseased riddled whore and fuck her in hell for all eternity.

640
00:49:46,177 --> 00:49:47,494
While the devil burns you ...

641
00:49:48,461 --> 00:49:51,633
with hot jagged metal and suffocates you

642
00:49:52,782 --> 00:49:54,206
with molten fury.

643
00:49:59,283 --> 00:50:00,726
Fucking nutheads.

644
00:50:02,781 --> 00:50:04,116
Don't come beg me to come back.

645
00:50:04,737 --> 00:50:06,329
This was the last straw.

646
00:50:11,762 --> 00:50:13,443
That was really good.

647
00:50:18,892 --> 00:50:22,573
And by the way, I never loved you.

648
00:50:23,190 --> 00:50:25,794
And I'm changing our son's name to Pablo

649
00:50:26,299 --> 00:50:28,571
so I'm never have to be remembered of you.

650
00:50:29,501 --> 00:50:31,613
And stuck at your little bitch.

651
00:50:36,748 --> 00:50:38,901
You are off tomorrow, come take me out.

652
00:50:40,981 --> 00:50:43,418
Dude, back in the saddle!

653
00:50:43,441 --> 00:50:45,747
Who's the unsuspecting lovely lady?

654
00:50:47,193 --> 00:50:48,788
--Her name? --Yes

655
00:50:49,666 --> 00:50:52,826
The thing that you will be calling out in bed.

656
00:50:53,294 --> 00:50:54,809
if she's all upon you...

657
00:50:59,165 --> 00:51:00,578
Sandy

658
00:51:02,024 --> 00:51:03,847
It's your boss' name, isn't it?

659
00:51:04,746 --> 00:51:07,714
Wait a minute, are you
gonna date your boss?

660
00:51:09,395 --> 00:51:10,758
Oh that's hot.

661
00:51:11,958 --> 00:51:13,762
Oh, wait no, she's like 60 though, I thought.

662
00:51:13,990 --> 00:51:15,300
She's 40.

663
00:51:15,969 --> 00:51:17,565
But she got like a hundred kids though.

664
00:51:18,535 --> 00:51:19,975
Two

665
00:51:20,133 --> 00:51:23,741
So, when's this all going down?

666
00:51:24,608 --> 00:51:26,699
Actually, tonight.

667
00:51:28,611 --> 00:51:30,002
Dude...

668
00:51:31,116 --> 00:51:33,149
tonight's my showcase.

669
00:51:33,564 --> 00:51:35,595
I sent you a postcard.

670
00:51:36,997 --> 00:51:41,568
Right. It's just that she already hired another babysitter.

671
00:51:42,909 --> 00:51:50,290
Work's been really busy so finding another time would be virtually impossible.

672
00:51:50,412 --> 00:51:52,010
You'll understand.

673
00:51:52,627 --> 00:51:59,271
Welcome one and all to the second
annual Holligan theater, group showcase workshop

674
00:51:59,121 --> 00:52:04,472
I am your host, actor, director, choreographer, Magnus Croom

675
00:52:05,105 --> 00:52:06,610
Thank you.

676
00:52:10,544 --> 00:52:12,715
You are about to see 46

677
00:52:13,544 --> 00:52:19,701
of the most daring
the most empathetic beings in this out fair city.

678
00:52:19,951 --> 00:52:26,239
offering to you, performances from their favorite works of stage and screens.

679
00:52:26,289 --> 00:52:28,255
Please keep your seats throughout.

680
00:52:28,606 --> 00:52:33,333
for there will be no intermission.
Thank you and let the magic begin.

681
00:52:33,583 --> 00:52:36,345
Stella!

682
00:52:43,048 --> 00:52:47,571
Stella!

683
00:52:48,069 --> 00:52:49,468
To be ..

684
00:52:51,549 --> 00:52:52,915
or not be.

685
00:52:54,193 --> 00:52:55,683
That is the question

686
00:52:56,457 --> 00:52:58,316
Whether it is nobler

687
00:52:58,466 --> 00:53:04,273
in the mind to suffer The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune

688
00:53:16,706 --> 00:53:18,407
There he is.

689
00:53:25,137 --> 00:53:27,413
I had him in view.

690
00:53:26,548 --> 00:53:28,789
I was feeling over the edge into a dive.

691
00:53:30,119 --> 00:53:34,029
He saw me when I moved in for the kill.

692
00:53:34,186 --> 00:53:39,277
Is that how you remember it, Maverick?

693
00:53:39,118 --> 00:53:42,964
-- Is this Top Gun?
-- Not pretty sure.

694
00:53:42,730 --> 00:53:45,961
The rules of engagement
are not flexible, Maverick.

695
00:53:47,889 --> 00:53:53,470
They are there for your safety
you will obey them, is that clear?

696
00:53:53,520 --> 00:53:55,320
Maverick!

697
00:53:55,610 --> 00:53:57,197
Yes, sir, very clear.

698
00:53:57,099 --> 00:53:58,709
I guess we ...

699
00:53:59,312 --> 00:54:00,688
I. ..

700
00:54:01,168 --> 00:54:02,990
was just a little over enthusiastic.

701
00:54:02,959 --> 00:54:05,465
I guess you were...

702
00:54:09,734 --> 00:54:11,034
Platoon!

703
00:54:13,979 --> 00:54:15,343
Platoon!

704
00:54:21,622 --> 00:54:26,371
Hey, oh bro, I'm so glad you made it.

705
00:54:27,711 --> 00:54:31,362
I made it... I'm here.

706
00:54:32,956 --> 00:54:35,091
..saw the whole thing.

707
00:54:35,869 --> 00:54:37,534
Even your part.

708
00:54:39,799 --> 00:54:42,511
Was that Top Gun? --You know it was.

709
00:54:48,042 --> 00:54:50,346
We thought you were really great.

710
00:54:50,200 --> 00:54:53,348
I loved your postmodern take on the whole thing

711
00:54:53,198 --> 00:54:58,545
and it was creative how you acknowleged how derimitive it was.

712
00:55:01,405 --> 00:55:03,041
Thank you.

713
00:55:04,676 --> 00:55:06,444
Thank you so much.

714
00:55:08,358 --> 00:55:10,441
I told you guys...

715
00:55:10,988 --> 00:55:13,249
I told you people would get it.

716
00:55:14,249 --> 00:55:16,532
You gotta go party with us.

717
00:55:31,405 --> 00:55:33,109
I guess in a tree house.

718
00:55:39,336 --> 00:55:41,076
Outdoor shower.

719
00:55:43,483 --> 00:55:46,516
Refrigerator --In a refrigerator?

720
00:55:46,840 --> 00:55:48,281
All over it.

721
00:55:48,990 --> 00:55:51,646
In the display case of the coffee shop where I work.

722
00:55:56,381 --> 00:55:57,890
Don't do that..

723
00:56:06,792 --> 00:56:08,555
The craziest place

724
00:56:09,791 --> 00:56:11,113
I have to say...

725
00:56:11,496 --> 00:56:14,360
on the surfboard, in the ocean.

726
00:56:19,478 --> 00:56:21,148
Sesha buche.

727
00:56:28,037 --> 00:56:29,711
It's really romantic.

728
00:57:11,825 --> 00:57:13,541
Hello, Aram.

729
00:57:14,457 --> 00:57:17,516
I've been thinking a lot about you lately.

730
00:57:18,988 --> 00:57:20,690
Hi, Alice.

731
00:57:22,826 --> 00:57:26,612
I have regrets about, you know, how I broke up with you

732
00:57:27,953 --> 00:57:30,879
I found I have this problem with sex

733
00:57:31,307 --> 00:57:37,832
because I just use it to get what I want and I really think that's what I did with you.

734
00:57:42,068 --> 00:57:46,094
I would love to meet with you,

735
00:57:44,159 --> 00:57:50,062
so we can talk and make some apologies to you.

736
00:57:50,905 --> 00:57:54,156
-- Amends?
-- Yes, amends.

737
00:57:56,172 --> 00:57:57,489
I'm really sorry.

738
00:57:58,632 --> 00:58:03,665
You know, I should get going. I don't wanna keep my sister waiting.

739
00:58:03,915 --> 00:58:05,271
What?

740
00:58:16,077 --> 00:58:17,680
I'm so hot.

741
00:58:44,417 --> 00:58:46,837
So? It was...

742
00:58:46,923 --> 00:58:48,336
Long.

743
00:58:48,420 --> 00:58:51,681
I know, I think that you went to a hotel or something.

744
00:58:51,531 --> 00:58:52,886
Oh please.

745
00:58:56,013 --> 00:58:59,024
Honey, what's with your hair?

746
00:58:59,191 --> 00:59:00,507
What?

747
00:59:03,911 --> 00:59:05,345
Okay, fine.

748
00:59:07,023 --> 00:59:09,935
It was awkward and cute and tedious.

749
00:59:10,829 --> 00:59:12,763
Did you just say cute and tedious?

750
00:59:12,933 --> 00:59:15,995
I mean he's a kid and it was tedious.

751
00:59:16,425 --> 00:59:18,185
Sounds like you didn't give him a chance.

752
00:59:18,637 --> 00:59:23,023
-- Did you even kiss those young, soft lips?
-- We didn't get there.

753
00:59:23,273 --> 00:59:27,838
We went to his friend's acting showcase and to this after party at The Loft

754
00:59:27,932 --> 00:59:29,278
Acting showcase?

755
00:59:29,323 --> 00:59:31,466
But now I need a bath.

756
00:59:31,516 --> 00:59:33,580
Alright. My God

757
00:59:36,233 --> 00:59:37,581
What?

758
00:59:39,342 --> 00:59:41,476
Thanks for babysitting.

759
00:59:41,526 --> 00:59:43,016
Okay.

760
00:59:43,375 --> 00:59:46,607
-- Sorry you couldn't get laid.
-- Shut up.

761
00:59:58,840 --> 01:00:00,954
Tedious. --Just to get rid of her.

762
01:00:04,193 --> 01:00:06,039
It was or it wasn't itt?

763
01:00:07,625 --> 01:00:11,473
Oh wait a minute, not quite so much tongue.

764
01:00:22,138 --> 01:00:23,492
Oh, God.

765
01:00:29,114 --> 01:00:30,448
That's gross.

766
01:00:30,641 --> 01:00:32,371
-- Oh shit.
-- Oh, God.

767
01:00:36,461 --> 01:00:39,929
Frank? What are you doing up?

768
01:00:40,439 --> 01:00:41,908
Was Aram peeing on you?

769
01:00:41,992 --> 01:00:43,383
No!

770
01:00:44,509 --> 01:00:46,364
I would never do that.

771
01:00:46,738 --> 01:00:49,633
Okay, are you sleeping over?

772
01:00:50,537 --> 01:00:51,861
-- No.
-- No.

773
01:00:52,326 --> 01:00:53,668
-- No?
-- Oh, well.

774
01:00:56,001 --> 01:00:57,430
Don't forget your pants.

775
01:01:00,748 --> 01:01:04,066
-- So does that mean you and mom are gonna have a baby?
-- No!

776
01:01:03,716 --> 01:01:07,084
I don't get it you said that spern makes a baby.

777
01:01:07,072 --> 01:01:08,490
Sperm. and it does.

778
01:01:11,651 --> 01:01:14,585
Can we stop talking
about this, please?

779
01:01:16,290 --> 01:01:19,082
I like your mother and I
think she likes me,

780
01:01:19,512 --> 01:01:21,279
and it's all that's important.

781
01:01:21,359 --> 01:01:23,297
You also work for her.

782
01:01:23,404 --> 01:01:26,045
-- Who's turn is it?
-- Mine.

783
01:01:28,285 --> 01:01:29,647
Okay.

784
01:01:30,232 --> 01:01:34,045
Cmon Frankie, let's get off the doughnuts.

785
01:01:37,682 --> 01:01:39,720
How is that possible?

786
01:01:40,127 --> 01:01:41,759
So you like mom.

787
01:01:42,574 --> 01:01:45,161
-- Are you two gonna date now?
-- I don't know.

788
01:01:45,240 --> 01:01:47,454
You don't really know anything, do you?

789
01:01:48,278 --> 01:01:51,741
-- I mean she's kind of your girlfriend.
-- Are you gonna be our new dad?

790
01:01:51,991 --> 01:01:54,770
-- and you'll also be our nanny?
-- Yeah, and what do we call you?

791
01:01:54,848 --> 01:02:00,916
Jesus, I'm not being nominated to supreme court here guys,
I just had sex with your mother.

792
01:02:02,646 --> 01:02:06,162
When I say sex,
I I mean that I gave her

793
01:02:06,503 --> 01:02:08,193
a nice massage.

794
01:02:08,051 --> 01:02:09,420
With spern.

795
01:02:09,968 --> 01:02:14,963
Oh, you caniving little liar. Oh is he
hiding in the hall?

796
01:02:15,213 --> 01:02:17,779
My God, he was.

797
01:02:17,901 --> 01:02:19,966
-- It sounds so dirty.
-- Dirty?

798
01:02:20,488 --> 01:02:22,394
Ok, it's a little dirty

799
01:02:24,530 --> 01:02:29,981
Well you got that out of your system. Now you're free to meet your next real guy.

800
01:02:30,319 --> 01:02:32,026
What does that mean?

801
01:02:32,076 --> 01:02:36,106
What, it means now when you meet a viable man
he won't have to be your rebound.

802
01:02:36,356 --> 01:02:38,167
Coz your nanny was your rebound.

803
01:02:38,194 --> 01:02:40,812
Gives you pleasure to say that, doesn't it?

804
01:02:42,090 --> 01:02:44,328
I'm not sure of buying
that "The Rebound" thing.

805
01:02:44,578 --> 01:02:46,864
Oh what, you're gonna date the nanny?

806
01:02:46,017 --> 01:02:49,445
Was having one night stand with a nanny more dignified?

807
01:02:49,900 --> 01:02:51,920
No, just more practical

808
01:02:54,090 --> 01:02:55,490
Wait a minute.

809
01:02:55,839 --> 01:02:57,571
You actually have feelings for this kid?

810
01:02:57,556 --> 01:02:59,664
Feelings? I have feelings
for everyone.

811
01:02:59,714 --> 01:03:01,221
That's the way the world works.

812
01:03:01,071 --> 01:03:04,078
God, you're in serious justification mode.

813
01:03:04,938 --> 01:03:07,066
Why do you have to be so cynical?

814
01:03:07,836 --> 01:03:12,594
I mean, I don't judge your
blatant disregard's recycling.

815
01:03:16,208 --> 01:03:18,981
This is not about judgment. This is about my friend.

816
01:03:18,849 --> 01:03:21,943
and what is realistic and what is not realistic for her.

817
01:03:22,210 --> 01:03:25,177
It's about me not wanting to see you get hurt.

818
01:03:25,227 --> 01:03:26,770
Happy birthday ... --Thank you.

819
01:03:27,854 --> 01:03:30,563
1, 2, 3 ...

820
01:03:33,226 --> 01:03:35,157
We get it.

821
01:03:38,977 --> 01:03:40,734
You need anything?

822
01:03:44,515 --> 01:03:45,822
Stop it.

823
01:03:45,912 --> 01:03:47,311
Okay.

824
01:03:50,920 --> 01:03:53,202
So did Aram tell you about this operation I'm having?

825
01:03:52,952 --> 01:03:55,469
-- Harry?
-- No.

826
01:03:56,267 --> 01:03:58,528
They're gonna give me a new asshole.

827
01:03:58,578 --> 01:04:00,006
There are children here.

828
01:03:59,840 --> 01:04:02,242
-- Cool, like from a dead guy?
-- Sadie.

829
01:04:01,992 --> 01:04:05,590
I think they're gonna have just passion ,
one out of something.

830
01:04:05,859 --> 01:04:08,663
Hopefully, it's something elastic.

831
01:04:09,418 --> 01:04:10,815
Awesome.

832
01:04:11,297 --> 01:04:12,891
Excuse me.

833
01:04:19,322 --> 01:04:24,408
This is so ... weird.

834
01:04:24,750 --> 01:04:26,619
My dad telling you about his surgery?

835
01:04:26,758 --> 01:04:29,510
Yeah .. I didn't know they can even do that.

836
01:04:31,746 --> 01:04:33,753
You look really pretty..

837
01:04:35,749 --> 01:04:38,043
No, no ...

838
01:04:38,155 --> 01:04:41,071
-- We are in your parent's house
-- I know.

839
01:04:44,423 --> 01:04:46,115
Where is everybody?

840
01:04:48,945 --> 01:04:50,959
Just a little red, I don't think it's trapped.

841
01:04:54,985 --> 01:04:56,761
Cake time.

842
01:04:58,886 --> 01:05:00,966
This one is just from me.

843
01:05:03,942 --> 01:05:07,144
Gummy bears and hand lotion.

844
01:05:08,668 --> 01:05:10,418
Thanks, Dad.

845
01:05:16,721 --> 01:05:18,401
Please. Open your mother's.

846
01:05:18,651 --> 01:05:21,081
-- No, no, he'll open yours.
-- You're his mother.

847
01:05:21,139 --> 01:05:23,642
Well, you're his employer. I insist.

848
01:05:24,051 --> 01:05:25,789
You'll love it.

849
01:05:28,408 --> 01:05:29,934
It's not fake poop, is it?

850
01:05:29,916 --> 01:05:32,261
-- No.
-- That's for Christmas.

851
01:05:32,022 --> 01:05:33,896
Oh, you have Christmas.

852
01:05:35,178 --> 01:05:37,143
What do we got here.

853
01:05:44,729 --> 01:05:46,940
A human totem pole.

854
01:05:49,644 --> 01:05:51,497
Gotta get you up here next time

855
01:05:51,345 --> 01:05:52,722
I don't think so.

856
01:05:53,192 --> 01:05:55,187
This is great, thank you so much.

857
01:05:55,437 --> 01:05:57,469
-- Good.
-- This is perfect.

858
01:06:02,967 --> 01:06:04,321
Thanks Mom.

859
01:06:03,865 --> 01:06:06,304
-- That was just from me.
-- So nice.

860
01:06:07,633 --> 01:06:09,004
Where did you get these butterflies?

861
01:06:08,931 --> 01:06:13,804
My grandmother gave that to my father and
I think it's time for you to have that.

862
01:06:25,867 --> 01:06:28,691
The message applies all these years later.

863
01:06:29,960 --> 01:06:33,206
Mother's love can never be replaced.

864
01:06:34,387 --> 01:06:36,079
-- Never.
-- Never.

865
01:06:38,093 --> 01:06:39,593
Thanks, Mom.

866
01:06:42,083 --> 01:06:43,585
It's antique.

867
01:06:43,501 --> 01:06:46,122
-- Whoa, that's cool
-- Beautiful.

868
01:06:46,367 --> 01:06:50,250
-- I might throw up.
-- What's the chances?

869
01:06:51,102 --> 01:06:54,097
60-40

870
01:06:56,309 --> 01:06:57,953
Which direction?

871
01:06:59,764 --> 01:07:01,384
70-30. now.

872
01:07:05,466 --> 01:07:08,984
At least you're, we're in your percentages.

873
01:07:11,566 --> 01:07:13,418
Sing me a song.

874
01:07:13,926 --> 01:07:16,064
No, you go to bed.

875
01:07:15,954 --> 01:07:18,782
Sing me a song, or I'll blow up on you.

876
01:07:19,332 --> 01:07:21,320
When you put it that way.

877
01:07:21,883 --> 01:07:26,358
Let's see what I have in my repertoire.

878
01:08:25,545 --> 01:08:27,566
Blow up.

879
01:08:33,092 --> 01:08:34,853
Stay tonight.

880
01:08:47,349 --> 01:08:49,314
Two Months Later

881
01:08:47,449 --> 01:08:51,693
Are we sure this guy is real? I mean, has anybody met him?

882
01:08:51,943 --> 01:08:53,937
He has no time to meet us, he has high school and all that homework...

883
01:08:55,520 --> 01:08:57,207
Isn't he in a baseball team?

884
01:08:57,681 --> 01:08:59,013
He's just running a little late.

885
01:08:59,235 --> 01:09:02,764
Well, he's definitely responsible for an attitude change, because you

886
01:09:03,774 --> 01:09:05,151
well, you can't just stop smiling.

887
01:09:05,086 --> 01:09:08,564
-- She's glowing.
-- Well, he's doing something right.

888
01:09:10,109 --> 01:09:12,158
I am sorry I'm late.

889
01:09:13,071 --> 01:09:16,444
Babysiiter needs to be walked through everything.

890
01:09:18,595 --> 01:09:19,965
Hi.

891
01:09:19,087 --> 01:09:20,449
I'm Aram.

892
01:09:20,504 --> 01:09:22,326
Sorry, this is Aram.

893
01:09:22,938 --> 01:09:25,141
Would you like a coke or something?

894
01:09:24,991 --> 01:09:27,861
-- Scott.
-- I'll take some wine..

895
01:09:32,722 --> 01:09:35,288
So Aram, I've heard a lot about you.

896
01:09:35,671 --> 01:09:37,352
I hope all good things.

897
01:09:37,202 --> 01:09:41,208
That you're wonderful with children,
that you're a great cook ...

898
01:09:41,657 --> 01:09:44,457
that you were born in 1983.

899
01:09:44,937 --> 01:09:48,015
Jesus! I was pregnant
in 1983.

900
01:09:47,750 --> 01:09:52,740
Let's just go on and get it out on the table, get it out in the open so we can enjoy our dinner.

901
01:09:52,990 --> 01:09:55,236
Yes, I was born in the early 80s.

902
01:09:55,092 --> 01:09:58,651
She also told me that you were very handsome and that seems to be true.

903
01:09:58,948 --> 01:10:00,973
I think that it's great you guys are together.

904
01:10:01,294 --> 01:10:02,727
In the words of The Bart:

905
01:10:03,799 --> 01:10:05,477
"The heart wants what it wants."

906
01:10:05,679 --> 01:10:07,223
You are so gay.

907
01:10:09,075 --> 01:10:10,958
Sir, are you ready?

908
01:10:10,908 --> 01:10:12,595
I can be.

909
01:10:13,357 --> 01:10:18,461
Scott, right? Do you mind if I borrow your glasses?

910
01:10:20,911 --> 01:10:24,933
You know, i'm just kidding, I'm just
25 years, I don't need reading glasses.

911
01:10:35,601 --> 01:10:38,129
Don't you wanna

912
01:10:38,076 --> 01:10:40,606
travel around the world, you know

913
01:10:41,021 --> 01:10:44,462
get crazy, rock Cleveland

914
01:10:44,382 --> 01:10:48,278
do things that people
your age supposed to do?

915
01:10:49,321 --> 01:10:50,803
Rock Cleveland?

916
01:10:50,847 --> 01:10:52,639
Yeah, rock it.

917
01:10:58,557 --> 01:10:59,932
Live.

918
01:11:01,350 --> 01:11:04,952
To tell you the truth this is the most alive I've ever felt.

919
01:11:04,560 --> 01:11:06,816
You're too so goddamn romantic.

920
01:11:10,838 --> 01:11:13,761
What about kids? Kids of your own..

921
01:11:13,335 --> 01:11:14,758
It's not like you're 50.

922
01:11:15,084 --> 01:11:16,857
But I'm an old 40.

923
01:11:17,156 --> 01:11:18,814
What the hell does that mean?

924
01:11:19,541 --> 01:11:21,246
I'm wrinkling.

925
01:11:21,242 --> 01:11:24,391
You have no wrinkles on your face, do you?

926
01:11:25,396 --> 01:11:28,690
You seem to have eyes, something that I really love about you.

927
01:11:29,609 --> 01:11:31,123
I love you.

928
01:11:33,749 --> 01:11:37,760
and when you compliment me I love it, when you compliment me.

929
01:11:37,393 --> 01:11:39,320
You know, I heard you the first time.

930
01:11:41,652 --> 01:11:43,627
I have no idea what you were preferring to.

931
01:11:43,377 --> 01:11:47,212
-- No? You said I love you.
-- I didn't say that.

932
01:11:47,824 --> 01:11:49,929
I'm pretty sure you did.

933
01:11:49,344 --> 01:11:51,157
And I love you too.

934
01:11:51,974 --> 01:11:53,349
Really?

935
01:11:53,690 --> 01:11:55,940
Sorry, but I do.

936
01:11:59,706 --> 01:12:02,234
Just ... take it slowly.

937
01:12:11,741 --> 01:12:13,437
Slowly.

938
01:12:22,886 --> 01:12:27,656
Teram Owens, the man who wore baggage than a first class passenger on the Titanic

939
01:12:27,706 --> 01:12:29,008
Reaching but funny.

940
01:12:29,057 --> 01:12:31,674
T.O. the pig fan of the National Football League

941
01:12:32,367 --> 01:12:36,719
wherever he goes he is surrounded by distinct controversy.

942
01:12:37,350 --> 01:12:38,805
I like it.

943
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:41,267
Sex really agrees with your creative side.

944
01:12:42,137 --> 01:12:44,728
Are you alright, sweetie? You look pale.

945
01:12:45,203 --> 01:12:47,271
No, I'm just dizzy from following you around.

946
01:12:48,956 --> 01:12:50,747
Well, get that to me, please.

947
01:12:50,497 --> 01:12:52,009
Right away.

948
01:13:03,408 --> 01:13:04,767
Alright.

949
01:13:06,748 --> 01:13:08,522
It helps me think.

950
01:13:24,862 --> 01:13:26,638
We should talk.

951
01:13:28,897 --> 01:13:30,657
I knew this was coming.

952
01:13:33,849 --> 01:13:36,342
You think that books that I read are too juvenile.

953
01:13:36,192 --> 01:13:39,102
I know, it's just I've always liked this stuff..

954
01:13:39,141 --> 01:13:40,776
I'm pregnant.

955
01:13:45,500 --> 01:13:47,137
But ...

956
01:13:47,162 --> 01:13:49,596
I pull out most of the time.

957
01:13:52,029 --> 01:13:55,127
I know you're not ready for this, just wanted to let you know that

958
01:13:55,377 --> 01:13:57,498
I feel the same way from you...

959
01:13:59,774 --> 01:14:03,830
I just thought that you wanted to take things slowly.

960
01:14:05,676 --> 01:14:07,026
I did.

961
01:14:10,437 --> 01:14:11,768
This is ...

962
01:14:13,329 --> 01:14:14,690
big.

963
01:14:16,262 --> 01:14:19,015
Very ... big.

964
01:14:18,978 --> 01:14:20,985
I should've been more careful.

965
01:14:21,679 --> 01:14:26,250
I know this sounds crazy

966
01:14:29,051 --> 01:14:31,549
but I think I wanted this to happen.

967
01:14:34,691 --> 01:14:36,076
What?

968
01:14:37,690 --> 01:14:39,733
You said it yourself you don't wanna just coast

969
01:14:40,814 --> 01:14:44,091
not just coast along but this isn't coasting.

970
01:14:44,831 --> 01:14:47,169
This is a roller coasting.

971
01:14:48,296 --> 01:14:49,723
Oh, my God.

972
01:14:51,496 --> 01:14:54,572
Not Oh God ... this is a good thing,

973
01:14:54,683 --> 01:14:58,481
not the roller coasting thing, that was cheesy but...

974
01:14:59,117 --> 01:15:01,865
having a baby with you that's not cheesy.

975
01:15:01,834 --> 01:15:04,669
I mean ... that's not what I'm saying just...

976
01:15:05,047 --> 01:15:07,959
excited, I wanna be your father.

977
01:15:08,001 --> 01:15:09,394
What?

978
01:15:08,944 --> 01:15:14,463
No, I wanna be a father with you as the mother, that's the important part.

979
01:15:14,354 --> 01:15:15,913
You being a mother.

980
01:15:16,413 --> 01:15:18,411
You know, I thought, I hope that kid is like you

981
01:15:20,784 --> 01:15:24,297
I hope the kid's like you.

982
01:15:23,762 --> 01:15:25,652
A girl with brown eyes ...

983
01:15:27,063 --> 01:15:29,445
or a boy with brown eyes ...

984
01:15:29,346 --> 01:15:32,275
or just any color eyes

985
01:15:32,279 --> 01:15:34,816
Well, it's not the baby's head, not your size.

986
01:15:44,639 --> 01:15:46,190
What about Gium?

987
01:15:47,669 --> 01:15:49,029
For a boy.

988
01:15:50,565 --> 01:15:52,010
Gium Finklestein?

989
01:15:54,964 --> 01:15:56,548
Okay.

990
01:16:01,909 --> 01:16:03,360
What about Ira?

991
01:16:05,821 --> 01:16:07,662
The doctor will see you now.

992
01:16:07,946 --> 01:16:09,367
Great.

993
01:16:15,050 --> 01:16:16,646
Okay so...

994
01:16:16,906 --> 01:16:18,315
So?

995
01:16:18,451 --> 01:16:20,050
The blood work is normal.

996
01:16:20,776 --> 01:16:22,875
In other words, your are healthy.

997
01:16:23,474 --> 01:16:27,084
And that is always a good sign for future pregnancy.

998
01:16:28,576 --> 01:16:30,185
What do you mean future?

999
01:16:30,975 --> 01:16:35,432
I mean, this here is what we call an ectopic pregnancy.

1000
01:16:37,716 --> 01:16:41,551
There are any number explanations for this,
it's not necessarily because of your age.

1001
01:16:42,001 --> 01:16:43,398
God.

1002
01:16:42,461 --> 01:16:44,892
This is something that happens
periodically.

1003
01:16:45,717 --> 01:16:49,254
An embryo was formed but it intruded inside the fallopian tube

1004
01:16:49,104 --> 01:16:50,661
instead of the uterus.

1005
01:17:08,213 --> 01:17:10,428
Sandy, Sandy, Sandy ...

1006
01:17:12,255 --> 01:17:13,886
This was crazy.

1007
01:17:14,787 --> 01:17:16,814
I mean, what were we thinking, anyway?

1008
01:17:19,399 --> 01:17:20,867
You are so young.

1009
01:17:21,148 --> 01:17:22,547
God!

1010
01:17:22,772 --> 01:17:25,850
You live at your parent's house and technically you work for me

1011
01:17:25,867 --> 01:17:28,100
and I was thinking about having your baby?

1012
01:17:28,050 --> 01:17:29,553
What is going on?

1013
01:17:30,570 --> 01:17:32,143
So you have to know?

1014
01:17:32,251 --> 01:17:33,583
Can we just find out?

1015
01:17:33,715 --> 01:17:36,132
That is a deceivingly mature thing to say.

1016
01:17:37,216 --> 01:17:38,754
Why is it deceiving?

1017
01:17:38,704 --> 01:17:40,830
Because you're 25 years old ...

1018
01:17:41,845 --> 01:17:43,881
you get drunk off half a beer

1019
01:17:43,977 --> 01:17:46,617
and you read the Harry Potter series in your spare time.

1020
01:17:46,923 --> 01:17:48,578
A lot of adult read those books.

1021
01:17:50,230 --> 01:17:53,449
And besides the way I remembered it, you're the one that asked me out

1022
01:17:53,760 --> 01:17:56,712
I appreciate that you feel this could work

1023
01:17:57,450 --> 01:17:58,954
more than you'll ever know.

1024
01:18:02,086 --> 01:18:04,144
You were such a good person

1025
01:18:04,396 --> 01:18:06,353
real special person,

1026
01:18:06,482 --> 01:18:11,219
I mean not filing a divorce so your horrible ex-wife can get a green card

1027
01:18:12,264 --> 01:18:13,928
What'd be the point?

1028
01:18:13,578 --> 01:18:17,117
See, that's what I mean, someone like you
shouldn't be with someone like me.

1029
01:18:17,908 --> 01:18:19,546
An old girlfriend with two kids.

1030
01:18:20,288 --> 01:18:21,959
You're an ageist ...

1031
01:18:22,209 --> 01:18:24,853
Yeah, yeah ... I'm an old ageist.

1032
01:18:25,272 --> 01:18:27,501
Oh please, don't patronize me.

1033
01:18:28,136 --> 01:18:31,859
I may live with my parents and get drunk off half a beer

1034
01:18:32,109 --> 01:18:36,768
and yeah, I admit to being slightly adrift as far in my life

1035
01:18:37,018 --> 01:18:38,469
but I'm not a complete idiot ...

1036
01:18:38,719 --> 01:18:40,776
I know how I feel about you.

1037
01:18:42,074 --> 01:18:44,423
It's you that doesn't know
how you feel about me.

1038
01:18:46,131 --> 01:18:48,234
I just wish you had the guts to say it.

1039
01:18:51,426 --> 01:18:53,602
You've meant so much to me and my family

1040
01:18:55,502 --> 01:18:57,569
but this doesn't make sense.

1041
01:18:58,254 --> 01:19:00,395
And what future can we possibly have?

1042
01:19:08,199 --> 01:19:09,964
You know what I'm gonna miss the most?

1043
01:19:13,502 --> 01:19:15,165
It's you...

1044
01:19:16,541 --> 01:19:18,324
Your friendship.

1045
01:22:09,448 --> 01:22:10,762
 Go! </ i>

1046
01:22:10,627 --> 01:22:20,084
 Graduating Class of 2012. --Sadie Pageant and Sadie also received the award for best science project</ i>

1047
01:24:04,045 --> 01:24:08,098
We need to say a special thanks to you
for bringing us into you homes,

1048
01:24:07,871 --> 01:24:11,365
but most of all to those unsung fanatics.

1049
01:24:11,367 --> 01:24:13,814
-- Who make us look good.
-- Yeah, we do look good.

1050
01:24:14,360 --> 01:24:16,476
-- I'm Laura Rilley.
-- And I'm Scott Reynolds,

1051
01:24:16,326 --> 01:24:18,301
TMI coming at you next.

1052
01:24:21,478 --> 01:24:24,842
Sandy, you got a minute?

1053
01:24:29,558 --> 01:24:31,872
Hello .. hello.

1054
01:24:32,830 --> 01:24:34,176
Hello people.

1055
01:24:33,998 --> 01:24:37,375
Our illustrious leader, Ken Gordon,
has an announcement to make.

1056
01:24:39,388 --> 01:24:43,972
Although change can be
painful, change can also be a good thing

1057
01:24:43,822 --> 01:24:48,969
a necessary step in the evolution of
a company, a family like ours ...

1058
01:24:49,407 --> 01:24:52,624
 From the beginning of time </ i>
 all the way till today </ i>

1059
01:24:53,436 --> 01:24:56,351
there are certain things that
you'll always find.

1060
01:24:57,056 --> 01:25:02,893
Now, if you look at the pictures, can anyone see
what they all have in common?

1061
01:25:04,304 --> 01:25:06,966
-- Liv
-- There are people in all of them.

1062
01:25:06,716 --> 01:25:08,427
Exactly, great answer.

1063
01:25:08,631 --> 01:25:13,212
so almost everywhere you go in the world
you're gonna find these little communities of people

1064
01:25:13,362 --> 01:25:15,528
just like you guys
you guys are a community ...

1065
01:25:15,478 --> 01:25:17,264
your class, your family ...

1066
01:25:17,100 --> 01:25:19,118
I just came back from Mozambique.

1067
01:25:19,342 --> 01:25:22,414
Okay. -- I've been to the Non Talking Film Festival.

1068
01:25:27,580 --> 01:25:29,310
Aram?

1069
01:25:33,702 --> 01:25:37,016
You're the only one who gets
gifts from the kids at the end of every tour.

1070
01:25:36,887 --> 01:25:40,310
That's probably because
they're so excited, the tour is over.

1071
01:25:40,760 --> 01:25:41,676
Good to see you.

1072
01:25:41,926 --> 01:25:45,524
I was gonna go get a drink,
You wanna join me?

1073
01:25:46,979 --> 01:25:49,097
You know what I actually...

1074
01:25:49,751 --> 01:25:51,338
Have plans already ...

1075
01:25:51,388 --> 01:25:53,208
I do.

1076
01:25:55,773 --> 01:25:57,545
You're impossible.

1077
01:25:58,006 --> 01:25:59,707
I've heard that before.

1078
01:26:01,830 --> 01:26:03,794
-- See you tomorrow.
-- Okay, have a good night.

1079
01:26:05,024 --> 01:26:12,601
Here's to your mother ... the newest and undoubtedly </ i>
 most qualified anchor of the network, very deserving. </ i>

1080
01:26:12,851 --> 01:26:14,172
Thank you.

1081
01:26:13,998 --> 01:26:16,159
-- Congratulations Mom.
-- Thanks.

1082
01:26:16,509 --> 01:26:20,932
I know your own show is big step up
but I'll miss you.

1083
01:26:21,182 --> 01:26:26,471
I will be one studio over,
and I'll come in guesting.

1084
01:26:26,521 --> 01:26:28,490
I'm gonna holod you to that.

1085
01:26:30,668 --> 01:26:32,730
Gotta use the ladies' room

1086
01:26:32,680 --> 01:26:34,680
then we could stuff our faces.

1087
01:26:40,653 --> 01:26:42,466
-- Sorry.
-- Excuse me.

1088
01:26:46,953 --> 01:26:48,323
Hi

1089
01:26:48,711 --> 01:26:50,025
Hi

1090
01:26:58,796 --> 01:27:00,583
-- How are you?
-- How are you?

1091
01:27:01,617 --> 01:27:03,267
You first.

1092
01:27:03,518 --> 01:27:05,929
I'm good, yeah good

1093
01:27:07,369 --> 01:27:09,440
Kids are great ...

1094
01:27:09,993 --> 01:27:12,012
I just got promoted

1095
01:27:11,762 --> 01:27:13,441
I'm gonna start anchoring.

1096
01:27:13,832 --> 01:27:17,636
I watched you on TV, it's fantastic.

1097
01:27:18,042 --> 01:27:20,210
But that's not a surprise.

1098
01:27:22,181 --> 01:27:24,295
You look really good.

1099
01:27:26,553 --> 01:27:28,294
I'm 30.

1100
01:27:33,875 --> 01:27:36,908
I'm sorry about.. you know.. things

1101
01:27:37,996 --> 01:27:40,064
Don't even ...

1102
01:27:40,203 --> 01:27:42,630
it was just timely.

1103
01:27:45,795 --> 01:27:47,556
Traveled around the world.

1104
01:27:47,106 --> 01:27:49,704
-- Oh you did?
-- Never rocked the Cleveland.

1105
01:27:49,854 --> 01:27:52,408
but some pretty amazing things happened.

1106
01:27:54,075 --> 01:27:56,346
Dad, I told you I could do it myself.

1107
01:27:56,337 --> 01:28:00,368
I knew I could do it yourself. I bumped into a friend of mine.

1108
01:28:00,569 --> 01:28:03,345
Sandy ... I want
you to meet my son, Zeke.

1109
01:28:04,949 --> 01:28:08,601
I met him in Bangladesh
and we kinda fell in love with each other.

1110
01:28:10,388 --> 01:28:13,481
It took a couple of years,
but now I'm his dad.

1111
01:28:14,442 --> 01:28:15,813
Hi

1112
01:28:15,436 --> 01:28:17,657
Hi, I'm Zeke Finklestein.

1113
01:28:17,642 --> 01:28:19,707
You are huh?

1114
01:28:19,638 --> 01:28:21,056
I'm Sandy.

1115
01:28:20,801 --> 01:28:22,893
-- Nice to meet you.
-- Nice to meet you, too.

1116
01:28:27,643 --> 01:28:30,723
God, I bet you're an amazing dad.

1117
01:28:32,817 --> 01:28:34,368
And his mom?

1118
01:28:33,518 --> 01:28:37,757
Just me and Zeke, it's hard to find someone
that's good enough for us.

1119
01:28:40,962 --> 01:28:42,605
Right?

1120
01:28:44,158 --> 01:28:46,498
And what about you? Boyfriend?

1121
01:28:48,427 --> 01:28:52,552
Dating ... wasn't
my thing ... I discovered.

1122
01:28:52,750 --> 01:28:54,712
That's too bad.

1123
01:28:55,351 --> 01:28:57,959
Would you like to join us?

1124
01:28:58,466 --> 01:29:00,590
The kids would be thrilled.

1125
01:29:00,640 --> 01:29:02,540
I'm with my parents ...

1126
01:29:02,375 --> 01:29:06,126
Oh, you had me so worried, did you fall in?

1127
01:29:07,631 --> 01:29:09,704
Mom, you remember Sandy?

1128
01:29:09,792 --> 01:29:12,851
How could I forget?
You talk about her everyday.

1129
01:29:15,464 --> 01:29:18,814
I was just saying to Aram, you know, if he wants to join us

1130
01:29:18,264 --> 01:29:21,748
Oh are you kidding, we would love to, we would love to!

1131
01:29:21,806 --> 01:29:24,289
Harry, get up, we're moving.

1132
01:29:23,939 --> 01:29:25,519
I didn't do anything.

1133
01:29:25,471 --> 01:29:28,517
I didn't say you did anything
I said we're moving tables..

1134
01:29:36,487 --> 01:29:39,871
-- Look who I just bumped into.
-- Oh my God!

1135
01:29:39,721 --> 01:29:42,589
Look at how huge are,
you, you look like you're 13..

1136
01:29:43,637 --> 01:29:45,737
-- I am.
-- What?

1137
01:29:46,043 --> 01:29:49,419
I want you guys to meet someone,
this is my son Zeke.

1138
01:29:50,158 --> 01:29:53,703
-- You wanna play gameboy?
-- Yeah, go ahead ... take a seat.

1139
01:29:54,202 --> 01:29:56,824
Nice to see you. It's been years. --Yeah

1140
01:30:00,724 --> 01:30:03,346
We all get older and you stay the same.

1141
01:30:02,830 --> 01:30:04,680
Hello.  --Hi

1142
01:30:04,482 --> 01:30:06,582
What a surprise.

1143
01:30:06,809 --> 01:30:08,809
You remember us, do you?

1144
01:30:08,635 --> 01:30:11,246
You came to our house, remember?

1145
01:30:16,791 --> 01:30:19,796
