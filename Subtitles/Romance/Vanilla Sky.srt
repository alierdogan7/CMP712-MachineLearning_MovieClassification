1
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:03,272
Open your eyes.

2
00:01:06,149 --> 00:01:08,151
Open your eyes.

3
00:04:13,962 --> 00:04:15,339
Open your eyes.

4
00:04:17,799 --> 00:04:19,760
Open your eyes.

5
00:04:21,803 --> 00:04:24,181
David, open your--

6
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:29,811
Well, I suppose
the empty street meant loneliness.

7
00:04:30,729 --> 00:04:33,065
You're a shrink.
You gotta do better than that.

8
00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:36,485
I'm a doctor.
Let's not stereotype each other.

9
00:04:36,443 --> 00:04:39,488
Not all rich kids
are soulless and...

10
00:04:39,488 --> 00:04:42,658
not all psychologists
care about dreams.

11
00:04:42,658 --> 00:04:47,371
The question is how you got here
and why you've been charged.

12
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:50,624
What do you want to know?
I was about to turn 33.

13
00:04:50,624 --> 00:04:54,253
I ran three magazines
and a worldwide publishing house.

14
00:04:54,211 --> 00:04:59,466
Most days I fooled myself into
believing it would last forever.

15
00:04:59,383 --> 00:05:02,135
Isn't that what being young
is about?

16
00:05:02,094 --> 00:05:04,388
Believing secretly
that you would be...

17
00:05:04,429 --> 00:05:07,432
the one person
in the history of man...

18
00:05:07,391 --> 00:05:09,309
who would live forever.

19
00:05:13,355 --> 00:05:15,190
Where you going so early?

20
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:18,068
Don't record any more messages
on my alarm clock, okay?

21
00:05:18,777 --> 00:05:22,739
- Why not?
- I'll start to think we're married.

22
00:05:22,656 --> 00:05:25,033
Don't ever say that word.
I will never come over...

23
00:05:25,033 --> 00:05:27,661
and bring you chicken soup
and fuck your brains out again.

24
00:05:29,663 --> 00:05:31,498
How's your cold?

25
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:35,085
Still there.
How 'bout yours?

26
00:05:35,085 --> 00:05:37,921
You definitely took
my mind off it.

27
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:39,506
Really?

28
00:05:41,258 --> 00:05:42,301
Yes?

29
00:05:49,308 --> 00:05:51,393
"Juliana" here.

30
00:05:51,393 --> 00:05:55,230
Hi, Rayna. I missed my audition.
I lost my head!

31
00:05:55,814 --> 00:05:57,691
No, listen, I have to go.

32
00:05:57,733 --> 00:05:59,276
I'm with David.

33
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:06,158
Help yourself to whatever. Maria will
clean up. Set the alarm before you go.

34
00:06:07,075 --> 00:06:08,619
And...

35
00:06:11,038 --> 00:06:12,539
you are the greatest.

36
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,708
Bye, honey.

37
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:18,045
Bye, honey.
I'll call you later.

38
00:06:18,003 --> 00:06:19,004
When?

39
00:06:20,631 --> 00:06:22,966
- When?
- Soon!

40
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:09,263
Did you reserve the court?

41
00:07:09,263 --> 00:07:12,808
Easy. I can't handle heavy
conversation at this ungodly hour.

42
00:07:12,766 --> 00:07:16,270
Sorry to do this early,
but I gotta be done by 10:00.

43
00:07:17,479 --> 00:07:20,274
You're not gonna make
the 8:45, are you?

44
00:07:20,274 --> 00:07:21,942
- How did you find me?
- David Aames...

45
00:07:22,025 --> 00:07:24,987
you have to check the colors
for the new issue of Rise.

46
00:07:24,945 --> 00:07:28,824
-What are the colors?
-Yellow and red or traditional white.

47
00:07:30,909 --> 00:07:33,328
- Gotta think about it.
- David, please.

48
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:35,330
Don't be late for the 10:00
with the board.

49
00:07:35,372 --> 00:07:38,250
Don't tell anybody where I am.
I don't care if God calls.

50
00:07:38,208 --> 00:07:41,253
- I'm very, very busy.
- Yeah.

51
00:07:46,216 --> 00:07:49,011
- Can't you get rid of that board?
- The Seven Dwarfs?. No.

52
00:07:49,011 --> 00:07:51,138
Those people drive you nuts.

53
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:53,599
And that was the desire
of my father who hired them.

54
00:07:57,144 --> 00:07:59,605
You fucked Julie Gianni again,
didn't you?

55
00:08:01,064 --> 00:08:03,150
I know someone was there
when I called.

56
00:08:03,192 --> 00:08:05,235
You had that tone.

57
00:08:05,235 --> 00:08:09,531
"No, I got a cold.
I'm hanging in tonight, you know."

58
00:08:09,448 --> 00:08:10,616
I had a cold.

59
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:14,578
- I was alone.
- Fine.

60
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:17,289
-You do what you want with your life.
-Thanks.

61
00:08:17,247 --> 00:08:20,250
But one day you'll know
what love truly is.

62
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:22,503
It's the sour and the sweet.

63
00:08:22,461 --> 00:08:26,173
I know sour, which allows me
to appreciate the sweet.

64
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:29,593
Julie Gianni is a friend.

65
00:08:29,551 --> 00:08:32,262
Sometimes we sleep together.

66
00:08:32,930 --> 00:08:35,891
What? What?

67
00:08:35,891 --> 00:08:38,852
- What?
- My dream girl...

68
00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:41,104
Julie Gianni...

69
00:08:41,104 --> 00:08:44,399
is your fuck buddy.

70
00:08:45,317 --> 00:08:47,277
- What do you wanna listen to?
- Slow down, man.

71
00:08:47,319 --> 00:08:50,697
What do we got here?
Barcelona, Looper.

72
00:08:51,698 --> 00:08:53,033
Radiohead?

73
00:08:53,075 --> 00:08:54,660
Look out! Look out!

74
00:09:00,916 --> 00:09:02,626
Fuck!

75
00:09:06,255 --> 00:09:08,006
We almost died.

76
00:09:08,048 --> 00:09:10,425
- I know.
- Use your fuckin' head!

77
00:09:10,425 --> 00:09:12,886
My own death was in front of me,
and you know what happened?

78
00:09:12,928 --> 00:09:15,514
Your life flashed
before my eyes.

79
00:09:15,472 --> 00:09:18,684
- How was it?
- Almost worth dying for.

80
00:09:20,227 --> 00:09:23,021
We're at the front door.
We're coming up now.

81
00:09:23,021 --> 00:09:25,357
- Good morning, sir. Sleep well?
- Yes, I did.

82
00:09:25,399 --> 00:09:27,693
- Eaten yet?
- What's that?.

83
00:09:27,693 --> 00:09:28,735
Good morning.

84
00:09:28,735 --> 00:09:32,197
David, you were playing racquetball.
I've been covering you for an hour.

85
00:09:32,197 --> 00:09:34,616
I'm saving your ass
and you're playing racquetball.

86
00:09:34,616 --> 00:09:35,742
Thank you, Fritz.

87
00:09:35,826 --> 00:09:38,745
We are now exiting the elevator.
The board is not happy.

88
00:09:38,704 --> 00:09:41,206
- Good morning, Beatrice.
- Hello, David.

89
00:09:41,206 --> 00:09:43,917
You're in the Post today. Courtney Love
called to see if you got her E-mail.

90
00:09:43,917 --> 00:09:47,921
And Graydon Carter and Shelley Wanger
called to see if dinner's still on.

91
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:50,841
- Cool.
- Art department needs the colors--

92
00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:53,385
- yellow and red or white?
- Good morning, David.

93
00:09:53,385 --> 00:09:56,013
And did I mention the board
is pissed you're late?

94
00:09:56,638 --> 00:09:58,390
Hey, David! Hold up!

95
00:09:58,432 --> 00:09:59,558
Which one?

96
00:09:59,641 --> 00:10:02,144
Wait. This one?
David!

97
00:10:02,144 --> 00:10:04,396
Okay, they're all waiting for you.

98
00:10:04,438 --> 00:10:07,900
- You changed your hair.
- Yes. And David...

99
00:10:07,858 --> 00:10:10,152
opinions are expected.

100
00:10:18,702 --> 00:10:23,540
Do you dream about the board--
the Seven Dwarfs as you call them?

101
00:10:23,457 --> 00:10:25,542
Sneezy, Bashful...

102
00:10:25,584 --> 00:10:26,668
Sleepy...

103
00:10:26,752 --> 00:10:27,836
Happy...

104
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:29,129
Doc...

105
00:10:29,171 --> 00:10:30,380
Dopey...

106
00:10:30,422 --> 00:10:32,341
and of course, Grumpy.

107
00:10:32,382 --> 00:10:33,967
How was Aspen?

108
00:10:35,052 --> 00:10:36,178
Good.

109
00:10:36,261 --> 00:10:38,722
Now, I want answers
and I want them now.

110
00:10:47,356 --> 00:10:48,524
How's it going?

111
00:10:48,565 --> 00:10:52,277
They still look at me
as if I was 11 years old.

112
00:10:52,194 --> 00:10:54,196
He's going to inherit everything.

113
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:57,032
He gets it all.

114
00:10:57,199 --> 00:10:59,451
You're scared of your dreams,
aren't you?

115
00:10:59,451 --> 00:11:01,453
It's a nightmare either way.

116
00:11:01,453 --> 00:11:03,580
Is that how you explain
what's happened to you?

117
00:11:03,622 --> 00:11:06,333
- What?
- What happened to your face?

118
00:11:07,459 --> 00:11:10,379
- I'm not talking to you anymore.
- You don't wanna show me your face?

119
00:11:10,379 --> 00:11:11,839
No!

120
00:11:15,509 --> 00:11:18,595
- Do you know why you're here?
- Conversation, the coffee--

121
00:11:18,554 --> 00:11:21,932
David, the part where
we parry and joust...

122
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:24,685
and get to know each other
bit by bit--

123
00:11:24,685 --> 00:11:26,436
No. No can do.

124
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:29,857
We'll have to skip that because
you've been charged with murder.

125
00:11:30,732 --> 00:11:33,694
In four weeks, a judge
will determine your fate...

126
00:11:33,694 --> 00:11:35,571
based on what I write.

127
00:11:35,612 --> 00:11:39,700
- So you will talk to me.
- There is no murder.

128
00:11:39,616 --> 00:11:43,871
There is no murder!

129
00:11:43,829 --> 00:11:46,081
It never happened!

130
00:11:47,082 --> 00:11:50,711
- I don't have to talk to anybody!
- Want me to help?

131
00:11:50,669 --> 00:11:52,921
- Get the fuck away from me.
- You take it easy, sunshine.

132
00:11:52,921 --> 00:11:55,632
Take it easy, Face.
Your whole story's full of holes!

133
00:11:55,632 --> 00:11:57,384
Stop. Stop!

134
00:11:57,384 --> 00:11:59,303
Please leave right now.
I'll take responsibility.

135
00:11:59,219 --> 00:12:00,387
Please leave right now.
I'll take responsibility.

136
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:03,348
Please leave right now.
He's got control.

137
00:12:04,349 --> 00:12:07,352
I'm gonna get you,
daddy's boy little freak.

138
00:12:07,352 --> 00:12:10,355
- My parents are dead, you fuck!
- Enough!

139
00:12:12,608 --> 00:12:13,817
Is that true?

140
00:12:13,859 --> 00:12:16,904
- Good cop, bad cop--
- That you're a daddy's boy?

141
00:12:18,405 --> 00:12:21,700
Primer on David Aames Senior.

142
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:24,119
My father wasn't built
for the 21st century.

143
00:12:24,119 --> 00:12:26,496
He never went to McDonald's,
not once.

144
00:12:26,496 --> 00:12:28,707
He never watched television,
and yet...

145
00:12:28,749 --> 00:12:32,461
his biggest magazine
is still the TV Digest.

146
00:12:32,419 --> 00:12:36,089
He and my mother threw the grandest
parties of the literary world.

147
00:12:36,048 --> 00:12:38,133
Ballooned.
Jumped out of airplanes.

148
00:12:38,175 --> 00:12:39,510
He sought adventure.

149
00:12:39,593 --> 00:12:41,887
His autobiography is the manual...

150
00:12:41,887 --> 00:12:44,264
for every cutthroat publisher
in New York City.

151
00:12:44,264 --> 00:12:47,184
It's called Defending the Kingdom.

152
00:12:47,184 --> 00:12:48,852
I've read it.

153
00:12:48,852 --> 00:12:50,938
Page 127--

154
00:12:50,979 --> 00:12:54,107
" David Jr. was a delight
as a child."

155
00:12:54,066 --> 00:12:56,985
Did I miss something here?
Was that all he wrote about you?

156
00:12:58,111 --> 00:13:01,448
I don't think he ever
got over the fact...

157
00:13:02,074 --> 00:13:04,701
that I'm absolutely...

158
00:13:04,701 --> 00:13:07,246
terrified of heights.

159
00:13:08,747 --> 00:13:10,415
The irony continues.

160
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:14,711
When he and my mother were run over
by a drunken teenager...

161
00:13:14,670 --> 00:13:17,798
on New Year's Eve
ten years ago...

162
00:13:17,756 --> 00:13:19,341
he left the keys...

163
00:13:19,424 --> 00:13:22,386
to the kingdom...

164
00:13:22,386 --> 00:13:23,679
to me.

165
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:25,347
Fifty-one percent control.

166
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:28,141
Forty-nine percent going to a group
of seven board members...

167
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:32,563
who all thought they were
first in line.

168
00:13:32,479 --> 00:13:35,941
And you believe the board--
the Seven Dwarfs--

169
00:13:35,941 --> 00:13:39,611
put you here to take control
of your company?

170
00:13:41,738 --> 00:13:43,448
What do you care?

171
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:45,117
We're just talking.

172
00:13:46,994 --> 00:13:48,620
And tonight's Wednesday night...

173
00:13:48,704 --> 00:13:52,666
and I go to Black Angus for dinner
with my two daughters on Wednesdays.

174
00:13:52,624 --> 00:13:54,960
So I'll have to leave soon.

175
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:58,338
You do understand that our time
is limited, don't you?

176
00:14:01,425 --> 00:14:03,677
If I talk...

177
00:14:03,677 --> 00:14:05,971
you'll just think I'm crazy.

178
00:14:17,774 --> 00:14:21,195
With all the possible respect
I can offer a man...

179
00:14:21,153 --> 00:14:25,199
wearing a latex mask and spouting
conspiracy theories, David...

180
00:14:26,408 --> 00:14:29,244
believe me,
you've crossed that bridge.

181
00:14:30,329 --> 00:14:32,080
Enjoy your dinner.

182
00:14:34,041 --> 00:14:37,711
There are five basic emotions
in life, David.

183
00:14:39,463 --> 00:14:43,383
Tell me,
what emotion gripped him...

184
00:14:43,342 --> 00:14:45,761
before he entered that cell?

185
00:14:45,719 --> 00:14:48,347
Was it guilt...

186
00:14:48,347 --> 00:14:49,765
hate...

187
00:14:51,475 --> 00:14:52,935
shame...

188
00:14:55,270 --> 00:14:56,605
revenge...

189
00:15:04,404 --> 00:15:05,656
love?

190
00:15:07,407 --> 00:15:10,160
I'm completely on the wrong track,
aren't I?

191
00:15:14,915 --> 00:15:17,042
Who needs ice?

192
00:15:19,503 --> 00:15:21,213
David, happy birthday.

193
00:15:21,296 --> 00:15:24,967
You have got the greatest taste
in shoes, bar none anywhere.

194
00:15:25,509 --> 00:15:29,096
- Emma, have you met Lynette?
- I fear what we may have in common.

195
00:15:29,054 --> 00:15:33,350
David, did you invite the entire
Olympic snowboarding team?

196
00:15:33,225 --> 00:15:34,685
Tonight is my birthday.

197
00:15:34,768 --> 00:15:37,521
- Say happy birthday to David.
- Happy birthday.

198
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:42,359
Welcome to Graceland.

199
00:15:46,446 --> 00:15:48,407
Happy birthday,
you son of a bitch.

200
00:15:48,448 --> 00:15:49,533
Happy birthday.

201
00:15:52,202 --> 00:15:53,954
Hey, friends of me, hello.

202
00:15:54,872 --> 00:15:58,333
-Let the fun ensue.
-Living Stereo will be on-line soon.

203
00:15:58,333 --> 00:16:02,880
It is the great John Coltrane.
They would love an article on it.

204
00:16:02,796 --> 00:16:05,841
If you like it,
it's an amazing prototype.

205
00:16:07,134 --> 00:16:10,179
- Excuse me.
- No, no. Thank you. That's okay.

206
00:16:14,224 --> 00:16:16,935
- Literary god, Brian Shelby.
- Happy birthday.

207
00:16:16,977 --> 00:16:19,396
And all the usual shit
people say to each other--

208
00:16:19,396 --> 00:16:22,399
- How you doing?
- Living the dream, baby.

209
00:16:24,318 --> 00:16:27,029
- To what do I owe this pleasure?
- The pleasure of Sofia Serrano.

210
00:16:27,029 --> 00:16:29,698
We met today at the library,
if you can believe that.

211
00:16:29,698 --> 00:16:32,492
Sorry about my coat.
It's too big for your closet.

212
00:16:32,534 --> 00:16:36,455
-We were pretending to be intellectuals.
-It's amazing. I love your coat.

213
00:16:36,413 --> 00:16:38,749
I overdressed.
I mean, I underdressed.

214
00:16:38,749 --> 00:16:41,335
I'll continue like you're both
actually listening to me.

215
00:16:41,335 --> 00:16:44,338
Do you have another room
to put it in?

216
00:16:44,338 --> 00:16:45,964
I have ceased to exist.

217
00:16:46,048 --> 00:16:49,051
Madison Square Garden is nearby.
It might fit there.

218
00:16:50,010 --> 00:16:51,678
Happy birthday.

219
00:16:51,678 --> 00:16:53,805
- We picked it out together.
- Thank you.

220
00:16:53,847 --> 00:16:55,682
We picked it out together.

221
00:16:55,724 --> 00:16:57,518
- We.
- You're welcome.

222
00:17:00,354 --> 00:17:02,439
Stop flirting and open it.

223
00:17:05,817 --> 00:17:07,319
- Let's get a drink.
- Yes.

224
00:17:07,361 --> 00:17:09,738
I'll leave this upstairs.

225
00:17:23,210 --> 00:17:25,963
- I'll be right back.
- Okay.

226
00:17:27,798 --> 00:17:29,091
- Listen.
- Hey, Tommy.

227
00:17:29,091 --> 00:17:31,260
No, no, don't blow me off.

228
00:17:31,301 --> 00:17:35,138
I'm all packed. I'm going
back to London and I understand.

229
00:17:35,097 --> 00:17:38,350
You put me up for the other attorney's
job so you didn't have to fire me.

230
00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:41,854
That's a classy move and your father
would have done the same.

231
00:17:41,770 --> 00:17:43,605
It's okay, Tommy.

232
00:17:43,647 --> 00:17:46,316
I became incompetent.

233
00:17:46,316 --> 00:17:50,487
Is there anything more unbecoming
than an aging mascot?

234
00:17:50,445 --> 00:17:52,990
I cared for your father.

235
00:17:52,990 --> 00:17:55,409
I lived and breathed for him.

236
00:17:55,409 --> 00:17:57,953
These guys, the Seven Dwarfs...

237
00:17:57,995 --> 00:17:59,705
they think you're stupid--

238
00:17:59,746 --> 00:18:01,915
a corporate hazard,
a rogue.

239
00:18:01,957 --> 00:18:04,668
They are gonna find a way
to get you out, David.

240
00:18:04,668 --> 00:18:06,795
They're lined up for your office,
your life...

241
00:18:06,712 --> 00:18:07,963
They're lined up for your office,
your life...

242
00:18:08,046 --> 00:18:09,506
your position.

243
00:18:09,548 --> 00:18:11,633
They're working day and night...

244
00:18:11,675 --> 00:18:14,720
to cheat you out
of your 51 % vote.

245
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:18,098
And they're gonna sell
this tradition of words...

246
00:18:18,015 --> 00:18:21,268
so they can eat
in a better cafeteria.

247
00:18:22,019 --> 00:18:24,229
But what they don't know is this.

248
00:18:24,229 --> 00:18:26,690
People will read again!

249
00:18:29,484 --> 00:18:30,736
I got it.

250
00:18:30,777 --> 00:18:35,365
They even got a nickname for you
behind your back.

251
00:18:36,450 --> 00:18:39,494
Citizen Dildo.

252
00:18:40,704 --> 00:18:42,581
You got great instincts...

253
00:18:42,623 --> 00:18:45,751
but I say this with complete love.

254
00:18:45,751 --> 00:18:48,295
Claim your life...

255
00:18:48,295 --> 00:18:50,380
learn to be an asshole--

256
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:52,382
Two's enough.

257
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:56,136
Forgive me.

258
00:18:56,136 --> 00:18:59,139
I still believe
in this family, David...

259
00:18:59,139 --> 00:19:02,142
even if it's only you.

260
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:03,685
Get Tipp out of here.

261
00:19:03,727 --> 00:19:06,063
Drive him home,
and in the morning...

262
00:19:06,063 --> 00:19:08,357
tell him he's rehired
with a 50% raise.

263
00:19:08,398 --> 00:19:11,443
Give him that big office across
the hall from the Seven Dwarfs.

264
00:19:11,401 --> 00:19:13,362
And set up a meeting
with the other attorneys.

265
00:19:13,403 --> 00:19:16,031
I'm gonna be in early tomorrow.

266
00:19:16,073 --> 00:19:18,659
Well, earlier than usual.

267
00:19:29,795 --> 00:19:31,880
Hello, handsome.

268
00:19:33,298 --> 00:19:35,467
I've come to wish you
a happy birthday.

269
00:19:35,509 --> 00:19:36,760
Oh, man.

270
00:19:38,887 --> 00:19:41,139
I didn't invite you, Julie.

271
00:19:41,181 --> 00:19:44,017
- That was a little weird.
- That's how it works with parties--

272
00:19:44,017 --> 00:19:46,478
you have to be invited.

273
00:19:50,107 --> 00:19:53,110
I'm mad at you, you dick.

274
00:19:53,110 --> 00:19:55,779
We made love four times
the other night.

275
00:19:57,030 --> 00:20:00,993
- Is that good?
- Two's good.

276
00:20:00,951 --> 00:20:03,370
Three is very good.

277
00:20:04,371 --> 00:20:06,582
- But four--
- Four's pretty good?

278
00:20:06,623 --> 00:20:08,584
Four is--

279
00:20:13,714 --> 00:20:15,215
Four is what?

280
00:20:17,134 --> 00:20:19,595
Hold me, and then I'll leave.

281
00:20:19,636 --> 00:20:22,764
And you can go back and talk
to that cute brunette.

282
00:20:22,723 --> 00:20:24,183
Four is what?

283
00:20:24,224 --> 00:20:28,645
I don't wanna meet your fancy friends.
I knew them when I was fancy too.

284
00:20:29,938 --> 00:20:31,815
Four is what?

285
00:20:32,357 --> 00:20:34,484
She looks like a moth.

286
00:20:36,028 --> 00:20:37,487
A moth?

287
00:20:37,529 --> 00:20:40,657
Sometimes I worry about you,
that some clever girl...

288
00:20:40,616 --> 00:20:44,745
in a big silly coat is gonna come
along and play you just right.

289
00:20:44,661 --> 00:20:46,496
Then I'll lose my friend.

290
00:20:46,538 --> 00:20:50,042
And there won't be any chicken soup
parties for me and you.

291
00:21:08,268 --> 00:21:09,228
Bad.

292
00:21:12,814 --> 00:21:16,109
When will you call me?
Don't say "soon."

293
00:21:16,068 --> 00:21:18,862
I hate it when you say "soon."

294
00:21:20,989 --> 00:21:23,784
Danny Bramson gave him that
for his birthday last year.

295
00:21:23,825 --> 00:21:26,161
So this is what's become
of rock and roll--

296
00:21:26,161 --> 00:21:31,625
a smashed guitar behind a glass case
displayed on some rich guy's wall.

297
00:21:31,542 --> 00:21:33,961
It was a gift, actually.

298
00:21:36,088 --> 00:21:39,925
- I like it.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

299
00:21:39,883 --> 00:21:41,844
So how did you
get all this stuff--

300
00:21:41,885 --> 00:21:43,762
this apartment, this life?

301
00:21:48,851 --> 00:21:49,893
I see.

302
00:21:56,859 --> 00:21:59,695
How 'bout if you help me,
unless I'm horning in here.

303
00:21:59,695 --> 00:22:03,699
- You are, but the food's good.
- I have a problem. I got a stalker.

304
00:22:03,657 --> 00:22:06,076
It doesn't sound life threatening.

305
00:22:06,076 --> 00:22:09,288
I need for you to pretend we are
having a scintillating conversation...

306
00:22:09,288 --> 00:22:11,790
and you are wildly entertained.

307
00:22:11,748 --> 00:22:14,126
- I know it's tough.
- I'll improvise.

308
00:22:14,168 --> 00:22:17,921
She's across the room and burning
a hole in my back now, isn't she?

309
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:20,048
Red dress, strappy shoes?

310
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:24,011
Wow. She's really staring at you.

311
00:22:28,557 --> 00:22:30,976
- Shit.
- And she seems to be crying.

312
00:22:31,018 --> 00:22:33,145
Less happy.

313
00:22:34,563 --> 00:22:37,900
I think she's the saddest girl
to ever hold a martini.

314
00:22:44,323 --> 00:22:46,617
- Jennifer Kelly.
- Hi ,Jennifer.

315
00:22:46,742 --> 00:22:50,370
- You have another apartment.
- Sort of a day office. Come on.

316
00:22:54,541 --> 00:22:57,628
- I am not going in there.
- I am. Good night.

317
00:23:24,613 --> 00:23:26,907
- I hear her coming.
- Really?

318
00:23:39,545 --> 00:23:41,129
- Hi.
- How are you?

319
00:23:42,506 --> 00:23:45,634
We're safe, but I've got
nothing to drink.

320
00:23:45,634 --> 00:23:47,803
Who did these paintings?

321
00:23:48,846 --> 00:23:50,848
This is Joni Mitchell.

322
00:23:50,889 --> 00:23:52,933
This one is Monet.

323
00:23:52,975 --> 00:23:55,394
And this one...

324
00:23:55,394 --> 00:23:57,020
was done by me.

325
00:23:57,062 --> 00:23:58,397
It is a snowboard.

326
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:01,692
Well, two of them are geniuses.

327
00:24:03,610 --> 00:24:05,612
That is the real thing.

328
00:24:05,654 --> 00:24:08,323
His paintbrush painted
the vanilla sky.

329
00:24:08,282 --> 00:24:11,034
And his canvas.

330
00:24:12,035 --> 00:24:13,287
My mother's.

331
00:24:20,377 --> 00:24:23,213
- I'm surprised you're surprised.
- I can't keep this banter going.

332
00:24:23,213 --> 00:24:26,175
- Me neither.
- I caught you.

333
00:24:26,133 --> 00:24:28,886
Brian, come in here.

334
00:24:28,927 --> 00:24:31,346
- What's going on?
- Your friends are fun and I'm drunk.

335
00:24:31,346 --> 00:24:34,016
- Julie Gianni is stalking me.
- She looked dangerous.

336
00:24:33,974 --> 00:24:37,186
Nobody stalks me,
so I drink.

337
00:24:37,186 --> 00:24:41,106
- We're all out up here.
- Finish my Jack and Coke.

338
00:24:41,023 --> 00:24:42,649
- Stupid glass.
- I got it.

339
00:24:42,691 --> 00:24:46,111
- It's the stupid guy holding it.
- Don't worry. No big deal.

340
00:24:46,069 --> 00:24:48,614
I'll go get us something.
Jacks and Cokes?

341
00:24:48,614 --> 00:24:50,949
I better hit it. I drank
too much and I didn't eat.

342
00:24:50,949 --> 00:24:53,035
- The party's just starting.
- For you it is.

343
00:24:53,076 --> 00:24:55,037
You cannot go.
You are my guest of honor.

344
00:24:55,078 --> 00:24:56,205
Fuck you, David.

345
00:24:56,288 --> 00:24:59,291
You're paying me to write my novel,
so you own me.

346
00:24:59,291 --> 00:25:02,461
I don't own you. You are brilliant,
good-looking, handsome.

347
00:25:02,377 --> 00:25:05,047
But why'd you have to hit
on Sofia?

348
00:25:07,382 --> 00:25:10,511
- I wasn't hitting on Sofia.
- Fine. Whatever you say.

349
00:25:10,511 --> 00:25:13,222
- I'm crazy. I'm blind.
- You're not blind.

350
00:25:13,222 --> 00:25:17,351
You're drinking Jack and when
you do you start in with that...

351
00:25:17,267 --> 00:25:19,520
Frank Sinatra,
she shot me down...

352
00:25:19,561 --> 00:25:21,396
give me a cigarette
king of sad thing.

353
00:25:21,438 --> 00:25:24,358
- That I do. Give me a cigarette.
- I'll find one.

354
00:25:24,316 --> 00:25:28,737
Wait. You're rich and women love
you and I'm from Ohio and drunk.

355
00:25:28,654 --> 00:25:31,323
- Can I tell you the truth?
- Everybody does.

356
00:25:31,365 --> 00:25:32,824
I dig her.

357
00:25:32,866 --> 00:25:36,203
And I've never said this to you
before about any girl...

358
00:25:36,203 --> 00:25:39,790
but she could be--
could be-- could be--

359
00:25:39,748 --> 00:25:42,668
could be the girl
of my fucking dreams.

360
00:25:42,626 --> 00:25:45,128
- You're not from Ohio.
- I know.

361
00:25:45,087 --> 00:25:48,549
But if she fucks up our friendship,
she can go to hell.

362
00:25:48,549 --> 00:25:51,593
I won't allow it.
We are bros.

363
00:25:51,552 --> 00:25:54,054
- I feel the same way.
- Sure you do.

364
00:25:54,054 --> 00:25:56,431
- Hi.
- How you doing?

365
00:25:58,934 --> 00:26:00,811
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

366
00:26:00,853 --> 00:26:02,938
Where are you going?

367
00:26:02,938 --> 00:26:06,525
I am Frank,
and Frank must go.

368
00:26:08,110 --> 00:26:10,779
- What?
- I good you bid evening.

369
00:26:10,779 --> 00:26:12,489
Wait. I'll go with you.

370
00:26:13,365 --> 00:26:16,660
- Stay, baby.
- I'll give you a ride home later.

371
00:26:16,618 --> 00:26:19,746
- No, I have to work tomorrow.
- You--

372
00:26:20,622 --> 00:26:22,749
You are in great hands.

373
00:26:22,791 --> 00:26:26,170
I'm just humoring myself
that my opinion matters.

374
00:26:32,092 --> 00:26:35,804
You will never know
the exquisite pain...

375
00:26:35,721 --> 00:26:39,016
of the guy who goes home alone...

376
00:26:38,974 --> 00:26:43,687
because without the bitter, baby,
the sweet ain't as sweet.

377
00:26:44,980 --> 00:26:46,940
Have a good time.

378
00:26:50,194 --> 00:26:52,696
The sweet and sour speech again.

379
00:27:03,540 --> 00:27:08,212
- Why are you scared of heights?
- Many people are scared of heights.

380
00:27:08,086 --> 00:27:10,380
It's not the height
that bothers me.

381
00:27:10,380 --> 00:27:13,467
It's the impact
that terrifies me.

382
00:27:20,057 --> 00:27:21,725
I won't stay long.

383
00:27:21,767 --> 00:27:23,393
Hey, Paolo.

384
00:27:25,020 --> 00:27:26,688
Hello.

385
00:27:26,730 --> 00:27:28,982
I have to take you for a walk.

386
00:27:29,024 --> 00:27:33,070
I'm glad he protects you.
He's a lethal canine.

387
00:27:33,028 --> 00:27:36,823
I love living here,
and I refuse to clean up.

388
00:27:36,782 --> 00:27:38,242
No problem.

389
00:27:38,283 --> 00:27:41,787
I have to work around the clock
to keep this place.

390
00:27:41,745 --> 00:27:45,499
- You really are a dancer.
- For 14 years.

391
00:27:45,457 --> 00:27:48,544
But I don't dance like you dance.

392
00:27:49,127 --> 00:27:51,630
Do you want something to drink?

393
00:27:51,630 --> 00:27:53,674
Sure.

394
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:59,680
Hey, beautiful, beautiful boy.

395
00:27:59,972 --> 00:28:02,808
What do you want
for dinner tonight?

396
00:28:02,808 --> 00:28:04,434
Do you want fried chicken?

397
00:28:14,152 --> 00:28:15,821
I like your life.

398
00:28:15,904 --> 00:28:18,866
Well, it's mine
and you can't have it.

399
00:28:21,368 --> 00:28:24,663
I don't wanna know the story
behind this photo.

400
00:28:24,621 --> 00:28:28,584
- Who's Sergio?
- It's a nickname.

401
00:28:28,542 --> 00:28:31,587
- Your nickname is Sergio?
- It's a long story.

402
00:28:31,587 --> 00:28:34,923
And we don't know each other.

403
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:37,885
- So many secrets.
- That's because I'm an arms dealer.

404
00:28:37,843 --> 00:28:40,345
- I've never known an arms dealer.
- You do now.

405
00:28:41,221 --> 00:28:44,349
What about you?
What's your nickname?

406
00:28:49,938 --> 00:28:52,024
Citizen Dildo.

407
00:28:55,068 --> 00:28:56,820
You are not staying over.

408
00:29:01,283 --> 00:29:04,328
Never run a company. Stay an artist.
Stay an arms dealer.

409
00:29:04,328 --> 00:29:07,998
Oh, please. Somehow
I can't play the violin for you.

410
00:29:07,956 --> 00:29:12,127
Although, it must be difficult
controlling all those people's lives.

411
00:29:14,004 --> 00:29:18,008
Everyone at that party is connected
to you for survival in some way.

412
00:29:18,926 --> 00:29:20,052
It seems.

413
00:29:23,889 --> 00:29:25,849
Ever been married?

414
00:29:29,394 --> 00:29:32,272
Did you ever accept any
of your 12,000 proposals?

415
00:29:32,272 --> 00:29:34,858
Twelve thousand and eight. No.

416
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:38,195
And you moved to New York to dance,
paint, act and deal arms?

417
00:29:38,779 --> 00:29:40,656
Right.

418
00:29:40,656 --> 00:29:43,951
Do you wanna hear Jeff Buckley
or Vicki Carr?

419
00:29:43,909 --> 00:29:45,744
Jeff Buckley or Vicki Carr?

420
00:29:47,079 --> 00:29:49,039
Both simultaneously.

421
00:29:51,166 --> 00:29:54,127
Everyone said,
" Don't go to New York."

422
00:29:54,086 --> 00:29:56,296
I just think good things
will happen...

423
00:29:56,338 --> 00:29:59,091
if you're a good person
with a good attitude.

424
00:29:59,091 --> 00:30:00,509
Don't you think?

425
00:30:03,971 --> 00:30:06,056
You think I'm naive?

426
00:30:06,056 --> 00:30:09,226
No. I really don't.

427
00:30:09,184 --> 00:30:11,353
I dug her completely.

428
00:30:12,229 --> 00:30:17,025
Somehow I'd found the last
semi-guy less girl in New York City.

429
00:30:17,818 --> 00:30:20,487
I have to get to sleep.

430
00:30:20,445 --> 00:30:24,783
Truthfully, I also work mornings
as a dental assistant.

431
00:30:26,368 --> 00:30:28,745
Boy, am I going
to the wrong dentist.

432
00:30:29,913 --> 00:30:33,125
And you didn't immediately
wanna sleep with her?

433
00:30:33,125 --> 00:30:36,879
Well, you know,
I'm a pleasure delayer.

434
00:30:39,047 --> 00:30:41,842
- How does that work?
- Pleasure delayer?

435
00:30:41,842 --> 00:30:44,511
You don't know?

436
00:30:44,511 --> 00:30:47,222
You keep a relationship casual...

437
00:30:47,181 --> 00:30:50,267
until the absolute breaking point.

438
00:30:50,851 --> 00:30:55,689
And then one evening
or afternoon or morning--

439
00:30:55,606 --> 00:30:58,275
it could be months from now.

440
00:30:59,276 --> 00:31:01,153
You know how it works.

441
00:31:01,904 --> 00:31:05,282
No, actually I don't.

442
00:31:05,282 --> 00:31:08,410
I've been married for 22 years.

443
00:31:08,410 --> 00:31:10,704
You've got dinner
with your daughters.

444
00:31:12,539 --> 00:31:14,124
That's right, I do.

445
00:31:14,166 --> 00:31:17,461
Back then I had intricate systems
with women...

446
00:31:17,377 --> 00:31:19,087
you wouldn't believe.

447
00:31:21,590 --> 00:31:23,926
Like what?

448
00:31:26,595 --> 00:31:30,724
Hey, Doc, don't get melancholy over
the 30 seconds you were single...

449
00:31:30,682 --> 00:31:32,935
a long time ago.

450
00:31:32,935 --> 00:31:35,938
- That's what you think I'm doing?
- Oh, yes.

451
00:31:36,813 --> 00:31:38,649
You might be right.

452
00:31:39,691 --> 00:31:43,195
Let's continue.
Time is not our friend.

453
00:32:15,727 --> 00:32:18,397
Just our shortcomings,
that's all we're allowed to draw.

454
00:32:20,983 --> 00:32:23,527
I've never drawn such
a true likeness before.

455
00:32:26,905 --> 00:32:28,240
Mine's finished.

456
00:32:28,323 --> 00:32:29,783
Already?

457
00:32:36,498 --> 00:32:37,457
Done.

458
00:32:41,295 --> 00:32:44,423
- That's how you see me?
- Maybe I didn't add enough money.

459
00:32:44,423 --> 00:32:48,260
No, something you'd see on a wall
in a steak house in hell.

460
00:32:48,218 --> 00:32:50,387
It's wonderful.
Sign it.

461
00:32:56,810 --> 00:32:58,604
Let's see yours.

462
00:33:01,023 --> 00:33:02,316
Give me that.

463
00:33:15,370 --> 00:33:17,414
I feel bad.

464
00:33:17,456 --> 00:33:19,708
You said to draw a caricature.

465
00:33:20,709 --> 00:33:22,628
I know. I couldn't.

466
00:33:22,669 --> 00:33:24,963
I saw you like that.

467
00:33:28,091 --> 00:33:30,052
It's very good.

468
00:33:32,179 --> 00:33:34,473
I'll sell it to you.

469
00:33:34,515 --> 00:33:37,392
You monster.

470
00:33:37,392 --> 00:33:38,602
How much for it?

471
00:33:41,563 --> 00:33:43,398
One kiss.

472
00:33:49,029 --> 00:33:51,615
That smile is gonna be
the end of me.

473
00:33:53,992 --> 00:33:56,662
And what happens when
your friend calls you tomorrow?

474
00:33:59,498 --> 00:34:03,252
He just met you a few hours
before me. He'd do the same.

475
00:34:03,168 --> 00:34:05,963
I see that friendship
is important to you.

476
00:34:05,963 --> 00:34:07,881
It is. It is.

477
00:34:07,923 --> 00:34:11,969
And as his best friend...

478
00:34:11,885 --> 00:34:16,390
I know he's trying to finish a novel
about inadequacy and rejection.

479
00:34:16,306 --> 00:34:19,518
So the longer that I stay,
the better it is for his career.

480
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:24,648
Your career is the one
I'd worry about.

481
00:34:31,572 --> 00:34:32,739
Sorry.

482
00:34:33,657 --> 00:34:36,743
No. No, you're more right
than you even know.

483
00:34:38,203 --> 00:34:41,290
I used to be one of those guys
that just...

484
00:34:42,457 --> 00:34:45,085
snowboarded through his life...

485
00:34:45,085 --> 00:34:47,254
with no focus...

486
00:34:48,380 --> 00:34:49,965
whatsoever.

487
00:34:50,007 --> 00:34:51,967
When did you change?

488
00:34:52,009 --> 00:34:54,094
About five minutes ago.

489
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:59,099
Every passing minute is another
chance to turn it all around.

490
00:35:05,647 --> 00:35:09,818
And to those who think
that you're a charlatan?

491
00:35:09,776 --> 00:35:11,236
I understand.

492
00:35:11,278 --> 00:35:13,864
The perception of a head
frozen somewhere...

493
00:35:13,864 --> 00:35:16,533
waiting for reanimation
sounds like science fiction.

494
00:35:16,533 --> 00:35:19,912
- What are you watching?
- It's the greatest show.

495
00:35:19,912 --> 00:35:22,581
It's called Sofia.

496
00:35:22,581 --> 00:35:24,750
It is at the frontier
of a new science.

497
00:35:24,791 --> 00:35:26,376
Life Extension.

498
00:35:27,628 --> 00:35:29,963
How do you accomplish
such a thing?

499
00:35:29,963 --> 00:35:32,758
I've seen this 30 times.

500
00:35:32,758 --> 00:35:34,676
Life is full of surprises.

501
00:35:34,676 --> 00:35:39,640
But the greatest surprise of all is
that this doesn't 't have to end ever.

502
00:35:39,515 --> 00:35:42,434
We did a story on this guy.
He owns half of Arizona.

503
00:35:42,434 --> 00:35:45,729
- Is he a fraud?
- How would you ever know?

504
00:35:45,729 --> 00:35:46,980
Good point.

505
00:35:47,064 --> 00:35:50,317
Can you unfreeze a human life?

506
00:35:50,275 --> 00:35:53,195
Take the case of Benny the dog.
Benny's a dog.

507
00:35:53,195 --> 00:35:57,574
He was frozen for three months and
thawed out to live a normal life.

508
00:35:57,491 --> 00:35:59,952
That's comforting?

509
00:35:59,952 --> 00:36:03,330
It's safe for Benny.
I'm in.

510
00:36:17,135 --> 00:36:19,763
We'd better watch out.

511
00:36:22,224 --> 00:36:24,935
Raymond Tooley,
creator of Life Extension.

512
00:36:24,935 --> 00:36:28,438
The book is Life.. The Sequel.

513
00:36:35,988 --> 00:36:39,575
- Where are you going?
- I left my number on your fridge.

514
00:36:40,409 --> 00:36:42,619
Come here.
I want to tell you a secret.

515
00:37:04,391 --> 00:37:07,186
I meant that to be your forehead.

516
00:37:12,149 --> 00:37:14,443
Thank you for the inspiration.

517
00:37:15,736 --> 00:37:19,698
I will now attempt to run
my company showing compassion...

518
00:37:19,615 --> 00:37:21,700
for the seething throng
of my partners...

519
00:37:21,742 --> 00:37:25,537
who root quietly for me to fail.

520
00:37:25,495 --> 00:37:28,498
And for things you don't even know.

521
00:37:28,457 --> 00:37:29,666
Thank you.

522
00:37:30,918 --> 00:37:34,379
I'm gonna go to work.
I have a company to run.

523
00:37:38,175 --> 00:37:40,219
Pleasure delayer.

524
00:38:21,093 --> 00:38:22,970
Hey, handsome.

525
00:38:23,011 --> 00:38:24,638
You're following me.

526
00:38:26,014 --> 00:38:27,474
Just a little bit.

527
00:38:27,516 --> 00:38:29,810
I wanted to finish
what we were talking about.

528
00:38:29,852 --> 00:38:30,769
And?

529
00:38:32,354 --> 00:38:37,025
How did it go with our moth girl?
She turn into a butterfly for you?

530
00:38:38,569 --> 00:38:40,195
Yes, she did.

531
00:38:41,613 --> 00:38:43,532
She did.

532
00:38:45,742 --> 00:38:48,537
I can tell by the way you were
walking you didn't sleep with her.

533
00:38:51,039 --> 00:38:54,710
Let me guess. You haven't slept
with her because...

534
00:38:54,668 --> 00:38:57,421
it's more fun
when you can draw it out.

535
00:38:57,421 --> 00:39:00,465
Sex just isn't as good if a woman
hasn't told her friends...

536
00:39:00,465 --> 00:39:02,259
she'd never sleep with you.

537
00:39:03,677 --> 00:39:06,680
Right on the money, Julie.

538
00:39:06,638 --> 00:39:09,975
She must be exhausted from trying
to be witty for you all night.

539
00:39:09,933 --> 00:39:11,310
Hey ,Julie.

540
00:39:12,978 --> 00:39:14,354
Sorry.

541
00:39:14,938 --> 00:39:17,149
It's okay.

542
00:39:17,191 --> 00:39:20,819
You never seem to be there for your
friends until they've given up on you.

543
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:30,204
I'm not blowing you off.
I just--

544
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:33,207
I wanna be alone
for a little bit. Trust me.

545
00:39:33,165 --> 00:39:35,834
I have a lot of things
I have to take care of.

546
00:39:35,834 --> 00:39:38,670
And if we're friends,
which we are...

547
00:39:38,670 --> 00:39:42,090
okay, then
you'll understand that.

548
00:39:42,049 --> 00:39:45,302
I'm sorry.
I got weird.

549
00:39:46,970 --> 00:39:50,432
I missed an audition and...

550
00:39:50,390 --> 00:39:53,268
it just made me feel bad you
didn't invite me to your party.

551
00:39:59,107 --> 00:40:01,818
You wanna make it up to me?

552
00:40:01,818 --> 00:40:04,029
I won't tell a soul.

553
00:40:23,257 --> 00:40:26,093
Would you do a story on me
if I made a CD?

554
00:40:26,093 --> 00:40:28,428
Sure I would.

555
00:40:35,269 --> 00:40:36,937
Do you like my music?

556
00:40:38,939 --> 00:40:40,983
It's vivid.

557
00:40:45,195 --> 00:40:48,282
Well, if I weren't me,
I would buy a CD by me.

558
00:40:48,282 --> 00:40:51,285
Well, you know,
if you can reach one person--

559
00:40:53,203 --> 00:40:54,663
Wow.

560
00:41:00,460 --> 00:41:04,006
What's happiness to you, David?

561
00:41:03,964 --> 00:41:06,300
What's happiness to me?

562
00:41:08,260 --> 00:41:10,888
- What is happiness--
- 'Cause for me...

563
00:41:12,431 --> 00:41:14,766
this is happiness--

564
00:41:14,725 --> 00:41:17,477
just being with you.

565
00:41:22,149 --> 00:41:24,359
There's one thing
that bothers me.

566
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:29,698
Why did you tell Brian
that I was your fuck buddy?

567
00:41:30,699 --> 00:41:34,077
I didn't tell him that.
I didn't say that.

568
00:41:34,912 --> 00:41:39,625
- When did you stop caring, David?
- Caring about what?

569
00:41:39,541 --> 00:41:43,045
About the consequences of
the promises that you've made.

570
00:41:43,003 --> 00:41:46,006
- Promises?
- Yeah, the promises.

571
00:41:47,716 --> 00:41:49,343
I thought--

572
00:41:50,719 --> 00:41:53,263
Get the fuck--
What are you talking about?

573
00:41:53,263 --> 00:41:56,433
Do you understand how hard it is
to pretend to be your buddy?

574
00:41:57,643 --> 00:41:59,311
David, I love you.

575
00:42:00,896 --> 00:42:02,773
I fucking love you!

576
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:05,442
I fucking love you!

577
00:42:05,442 --> 00:42:06,443
Fuck!

578
00:42:06,527 --> 00:42:08,654
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

579
00:42:09,321 --> 00:42:11,740
Don't do this.
Don't do this.

580
00:42:11,782 --> 00:42:14,117
You fucked me four times
the other night.

581
00:42:14,117 --> 00:42:16,787
You've been inside me.

582
00:42:16,787 --> 00:42:19,790
I swallowed your cum.
That means something.

583
00:42:22,751 --> 00:42:23,794
Slow down.

584
00:42:23,836 --> 00:42:27,714
Four times-- it means something.

585
00:42:27,673 --> 00:42:29,633
- Four times.
- Stop the car.

586
00:42:29,675 --> 00:42:32,970
Twenty-four hours a day, I live
with this aching possibility...

587
00:42:32,928 --> 00:42:35,514
that you might call me
to do something.

588
00:42:35,514 --> 00:42:38,183
Let's go to your house.
I wanna see where you live.

589
00:42:38,809 --> 00:42:42,354
Just slow down.
I want you to stop the car!

590
00:42:42,354 --> 00:42:44,481
Don't you know when you sleep
with someone...

591
00:42:44,481 --> 00:42:48,026
your body makes a promise
whether you do or not?

592
00:42:50,612 --> 00:42:53,949
Tell me something, David.
Do you believe in God?

593
00:42:58,579 --> 00:43:00,914
What are you doing?

594
00:43:01,748 --> 00:43:04,209
Okay, I love you.
I love you.

595
00:43:12,593 --> 00:43:13,844
Don't do it!

596
00:44:09,233 --> 00:44:10,567
You're amazing.

597
00:44:13,111 --> 00:44:15,447
Did you get to work all right?

598
00:44:18,700 --> 00:44:23,497
No, actually,
I had a horrible dream.

599
00:44:23,413 --> 00:44:25,999
You dreamed you'd never
.
see me again.

600
00:44:25,999 --> 00:44:28,794
I left your apartment,
I went downstairs to the car...

601
00:44:28,794 --> 00:44:32,714
and my friend, the stalker,
had followed me there.

602
00:44:34,466 --> 00:44:37,219
Yes. And she wanted
to talk to me.

603
00:44:37,261 --> 00:44:41,640
And I remember I had this buzz,
you know...

604
00:44:41,515 --> 00:44:44,351
that buzz from you and me.

605
00:44:44,351 --> 00:44:49,398
I think my mind was still on
that terrible drawing of me.

606
00:44:51,400 --> 00:44:54,278
But she was upset...

607
00:44:55,904 --> 00:44:57,239
about-- I don't know.

608
00:44:57,281 --> 00:44:59,908
I got in the car and...

609
00:44:59,908 --> 00:45:02,953
she drove off a bridge...

610
00:45:02,953 --> 00:45:06,540
and committed suicide
with me in the car.

611
00:45:06,498 --> 00:45:09,668
I thought you were going
straight to work.

612
00:45:13,338 --> 00:45:14,965
But I survived...

613
00:45:15,966 --> 00:45:20,304
with my arm and my face...

614
00:45:21,597 --> 00:45:23,682
reconstructed.

615
00:45:23,724 --> 00:45:26,476
And what's worse...

616
00:45:26,476 --> 00:45:30,022
is that I can't wake up.

617
00:45:55,214 --> 00:45:57,674
And how was your house
after the party?

618
00:46:00,385 --> 00:46:01,845
Party?

619
00:46:03,388 --> 00:46:04,848
What party?

620
00:46:04,890 --> 00:46:06,517
The party.

621
00:46:09,645 --> 00:46:10,729
Remember?

622
00:46:12,022 --> 00:46:14,566
Red dress, strappy shoes.

623
00:46:16,318 --> 00:46:20,280
I spilled something
on your shirt.

624
00:46:20,197 --> 00:46:22,199
Sweet and sour.

625
00:46:23,534 --> 00:46:27,329
And the saddest girl
to ever hold a martini.

626
00:46:50,227 --> 00:46:52,604
My dreams are a cruel jokke.

627
00:46:55,440 --> 00:46:57,401
They taunt me.

628
00:47:05,242 --> 00:47:07,703
Even in my dreams,
I'm an idiot...

629
00:47:07,661 --> 00:47:10,497
who knows he's about
to wake up to reality.

630
00:47:13,584 --> 00:47:16,295
If I could only avoid sleep.

631
00:47:18,130 --> 00:47:20,299
But I can 't.

632
00:47:20,257 --> 00:47:22,926
I try to tell myself
what to dream.

633
00:47:24,011 --> 00:47:26,805
I try to dream that I'm flying.

634
00:47:26,847 --> 00:47:28,515
Something free.

635
00:47:31,602 --> 00:47:32,895
It never works.

636
00:47:39,943 --> 00:47:42,988
Is that the only thing you dream?

637
00:47:45,365 --> 00:47:47,701
I don't-- I don't remember.

638
00:47:52,998 --> 00:47:55,125
Do you dream about
the car accident?

639
00:47:56,710 --> 00:47:59,588
Here's what you remember
from a coma.

640
00:48:00,255 --> 00:48:01,715
Nothing.

641
00:48:05,594 --> 00:48:07,304
What happened next?

642
00:48:07,346 --> 00:48:10,265
What really happened?

643
00:48:10,224 --> 00:48:14,311
What, didn't you read
the file?

644
00:48:14,228 --> 00:48:16,271
I was out for
three-and-a-half weeks.

645
00:48:16,313 --> 00:48:20,442
My face and my arm shattered and
my jaw was broken in four places.

646
00:48:21,443 --> 00:48:25,197
No surgery could be performed
because of the coma.

647
00:48:26,240 --> 00:48:29,368
You can't feel the darkness...

648
00:48:29,284 --> 00:48:30,702
or numbness.

649
00:48:31,912 --> 00:48:34,456
You can't even feel.

650
00:48:34,456 --> 00:48:36,208
And then...

651
00:48:36,250 --> 00:48:38,502
I came back to life.

652
00:48:41,046 --> 00:48:43,131
Just like that dog.

653
00:48:43,173 --> 00:48:45,717
Benny. You know, Benny the dog.

654
00:48:46,635 --> 00:48:48,762
Benny. Benny the dog.

655
00:48:48,762 --> 00:48:52,307
Only my life
was no longer normal.

656
00:48:53,016 --> 00:48:56,687
There are blinding migraines now--
nerve damage.

657
00:48:56,645 --> 00:48:58,063
Why?

658
00:48:58,105 --> 00:49:02,109
This is how
big business operates--

659
00:49:02,067 --> 00:49:04,152
random accidents...

660
00:49:04,194 --> 00:49:06,780
a lifestyle mishap.

661
00:49:06,780 --> 00:49:08,532
They are not coincidences.

662
00:49:08,574 --> 00:49:13,537
How do you think
airtight contracts are broken?

663
00:49:13,453 --> 00:49:16,874
These are power upheavals.

664
00:49:16,874 --> 00:49:18,750
I'm from Ohio.

665
00:49:19,585 --> 00:49:21,628
We don't have power upheavals.

666
00:49:21,628 --> 00:49:24,798
They are in the news every day
right between the lines.

667
00:49:27,092 --> 00:49:29,094
Someone did this to me.

668
00:49:30,554 --> 00:49:32,973
My father wrote about this
in his book.

669
00:49:32,973 --> 00:49:35,392
Chapter one, page one...

670
00:49:35,434 --> 00:49:37,060
paragraph one--

671
00:49:37,102 --> 00:49:39,479
"What is the answer to 99
out of 100 questions?

672
00:49:43,317 --> 00:49:44,234
Money."

673
00:49:44,276 --> 00:49:46,778
David, look,
I don't wanna worry you.

674
00:49:46,778 --> 00:49:49,698
I'm holding them off,
but we got a situation here.

675
00:49:49,698 --> 00:49:53,285
The bylaws of the board
protect your 51 % vote...

676
00:49:53,202 --> 00:49:55,621
only if you're mentally acute.

677
00:49:56,163 --> 00:49:58,248
I'm sorry that poor girl died...

678
00:49:58,290 --> 00:50:01,335
but you've handed the board
a real gift with your mishap.

679
00:50:01,335 --> 00:50:04,755
They'd like to declare you
incapacitated.

680
00:50:04,755 --> 00:50:07,799
But you're back.

681
00:50:07,758 --> 00:50:11,720
You sound good to me,
so let's fight the fuckers...

682
00:50:11,678 --> 00:50:13,639
and have a full recovery.

683
00:50:13,680 --> 00:50:16,016
And maybe you should let
people see you, yeah?

684
00:50:16,058 --> 00:50:19,061
The last time we were together
.
you were in a coma...

685
00:50:19,061 --> 00:50:21,647
and you were very
fucking rude to me.

686
00:50:21,647 --> 00:50:24,399
You didn't say a word.

687
00:50:24,358 --> 00:50:28,820
Yes, well, the rumors of my death
have been mildly exaggerated.

688
00:50:32,866 --> 00:50:34,910
Who could I trust?

689
00:50:34,910 --> 00:50:37,829
The ants were taking over
the anthill.

690
00:50:39,706 --> 00:50:41,708
Who could I trust?

691
00:51:42,477 --> 00:51:46,315
The cranial structure
was based on 30 pins...

692
00:51:46,231 --> 00:51:49,860
and fastened by micro-panels
and bits of bone from the mandible.

693
00:51:49,860 --> 00:51:52,905
It appears the cartilage graphs
have maintained your cheek structure.

694
00:51:52,905 --> 00:51:55,282
Unfortunately,
because you were in a coma--

695
00:51:55,282 --> 00:51:58,911
Doctors. Their power is in jargon,
so you study up.

696
00:51:58,869 --> 00:52:02,289
Is that the procedure for all
bilateral per orbital hecatombs...

697
00:52:02,289 --> 00:52:04,291
in a LeFort Three fracture
of a comatose patient?

698
00:52:04,333 --> 00:52:06,293
- In a LeFort Three?
- You do your best.

699
00:52:06,335 --> 00:52:07,336
Absolutely.

700
00:52:07,377 --> 00:52:10,797
The potential for intracranial
brain damage was too great.

701
00:52:10,756 --> 00:52:12,799
Beyond the cheek grafts,
Dr. Pomeranz...

702
00:52:12,841 --> 00:52:15,511
are the pins fastened with any kind
of aluminum which could ionize...

703
00:52:15,511 --> 00:52:17,721
and cause that pressure
in my head?

704
00:52:17,763 --> 00:52:20,849
- I'm ready for another operation.
- We are working on processes.

705
00:52:20,849 --> 00:52:24,102
But you're specifically not at
the stage where we can experiment.

706
00:52:26,605 --> 00:52:28,524
Experiment. Use me.

707
00:52:28,524 --> 00:52:31,109
The headaches will go away.

708
00:52:31,109 --> 00:52:33,695
These are more than headaches.

709
00:52:33,737 --> 00:52:37,991
These are like steel plates
slicing through my every thought.

710
00:52:37,908 --> 00:52:40,244
We're not cowboys.
We can't just wing it.

711
00:52:41,328 --> 00:52:43,705
Because I can't think straight
most of the time.

712
00:52:43,705 --> 00:52:46,792
- We can increase your medication.
- Oh, yes, medication.

713
00:52:48,502 --> 00:52:51,505
And there are things
that we'll continue to investigate.

714
00:52:51,505 --> 00:52:54,299
However, there are so many others
who've not had the aesthetic benefit...

715
00:52:54,299 --> 00:52:56,677
of plastic surgery
as you have.

716
00:52:58,470 --> 00:53:01,348
This isn't about vanity,
Dr. Pomeranz.

717
00:53:01,306 --> 00:53:03,308
This isn't about vanity.

718
00:53:03,308 --> 00:53:05,394
This is about functioning
in the world.

719
00:53:05,435 --> 00:53:07,604
It's my job to be out there
functioning.

720
00:53:08,564 --> 00:53:11,525
I've got the money.
I'll pay any amount.

721
00:53:12,526 --> 00:53:14,486
Just invent something.

722
00:53:14,528 --> 00:53:16,280
Just play jazz.

723
00:53:16,321 --> 00:53:18,490
You say you're
the best face man in New York.

724
00:53:18,532 --> 00:53:20,492
Fucking prove it.

725
00:53:24,162 --> 00:53:26,498
- We could do something about your arm.
- Fuck my arm!

726
00:53:31,670 --> 00:53:33,672
Nobody here takes your feelings
for granted.

727
00:53:34,840 --> 00:53:37,885
We did prepare something for you
based on the preliminary examination.

728
00:53:37,885 --> 00:53:39,845
Tell me. Bring it on.

729
00:53:39,887 --> 00:53:42,389
It's sometimes useful
in the early stages of rejection.

730
00:53:43,599 --> 00:53:46,476
It's a facial prosthetic.
It was two weeks in the making.

731
00:53:46,476 --> 00:53:49,062
- Thank you, Carly.
- You're welcome, Doctor.

732
00:53:59,323 --> 00:54:01,325
A facial prosthetic.

733
00:54:01,325 --> 00:54:03,368
The aesthetic replacement
does work...

734
00:54:03,410 --> 00:54:06,330
emotionally and actually.

735
00:54:06,288 --> 00:54:09,166
The plastic in the aesthetic shield
also blocks out abusive rays...

736
00:54:09,124 --> 00:54:11,126
and assists in
the regeneration of cells.

737
00:54:13,545 --> 00:54:15,964
So it's an aesthetic
regenerative shield.

738
00:54:15,964 --> 00:54:17,633
That's correct. Exactly.

739
00:54:17,674 --> 00:54:20,844
The ergonomics of the plate barrier
allows it to interact reflexively...

740
00:54:20,802 --> 00:54:23,347
with the movements
of your own face.

741
00:54:23,347 --> 00:54:24,806
I see.

742
00:54:24,890 --> 00:54:28,769
- It's a helpful unit.
- Good.

743
00:54:28,727 --> 00:54:31,730
Because for a minute there,
I thought we were talking...

744
00:54:31,688 --> 00:54:34,608
about a fucking mask!

745
00:54:35,609 --> 00:54:37,277
It's only a mask...

746
00:54:38,028 --> 00:54:40,072
if you treat it that way.

747
00:54:40,072 --> 00:54:43,742
It's great. This completely
takes care of Halloween.

748
00:54:45,911 --> 00:54:49,414
But what about the other
364 days of the year?

749
00:55:04,638 --> 00:55:06,723
A new form of me
began to take shape.

750
00:55:08,225 --> 00:55:10,978
I planned my reemergence...

751
00:55:10,978 --> 00:55:13,063
like the Normandy invasion.

752
00:55:13,063 --> 00:55:15,524
Sofia. Sofia.

753
00:55:17,234 --> 00:55:20,153
Sofia Serrano.

754
00:55:20,988 --> 00:55:23,031
I'll just say it.

755
00:55:23,073 --> 00:55:25,367
I did my homework.

756
00:55:25,325 --> 00:55:27,870
I read every memo.

757
00:55:27,911 --> 00:55:30,289
Thomas Tipp was right.

758
00:55:30,289 --> 00:55:32,249
People will read again.

759
00:55:33,959 --> 00:55:37,671
I attended the monthly board meeting
with the Seven Dwarfs by video hookup.

760
00:55:37,629 --> 00:55:40,007
Because people
aren't buying books.

761
00:55:40,007 --> 00:55:44,094
- Let's invest.
- Oh, baby, this was war.

762
00:55:44,052 --> 00:55:47,514
I grew stronger in ways
I'd never known before.

763
00:55:47,472 --> 00:55:49,558
And on December 5...

764
00:55:49,600 --> 00:55:52,186
my planes filled the sky.

765
00:55:52,186 --> 00:55:55,397
The return of David Aames,Jr...

766
00:55:55,355 --> 00:55:57,649
Citizen Dildo.

767
00:56:37,272 --> 00:56:39,316
You won't believe this...

768
00:56:41,568 --> 00:56:44,404
but this is me smiling.

769
00:56:51,036 --> 00:56:52,913
It's been a long time.

770
00:56:52,955 --> 00:56:56,708
I tried to see you,
but your people wouldn't let me.

771
00:56:56,667 --> 00:56:59,461
I didn't want to see me, okay?

772
00:56:59,461 --> 00:57:01,713
But then...

773
00:57:01,713 --> 00:57:04,299
I woke up today
and finally...

774
00:57:05,342 --> 00:57:07,344
a good hair day.

775
00:57:10,848 --> 00:57:12,933
You wanna get together?

776
00:57:15,561 --> 00:57:16,770
Sure.

777
00:57:18,605 --> 00:57:21,525
- What?
- Let's go out and do something.

778
00:57:21,525 --> 00:57:23,318
This weekend.

779
00:57:23,360 --> 00:57:25,696
I'll cancel an operation or two.

780
00:57:25,737 --> 00:57:28,198
We'll have fun...

781
00:57:28,198 --> 00:57:31,827
because I am all about fun.

782
00:57:34,955 --> 00:57:38,834
Okay, folks, our first guest tonight
is an amazing survival story.

783
00:57:38,834 --> 00:57:41,003
Please welcome Benny the dog.

784
00:57:46,592 --> 00:57:49,386
So welcome to the show.
Thank you very much for being here.

785
00:57:49,386 --> 00:57:51,555
- You bet. My pleasure.
- I have so many questions.

786
00:57:51,555 --> 00:57:55,058
To start off, tell us all
what has happened to Benny.

787
00:57:55,017 --> 00:57:57,227
What's Benny been through?

788
00:57:57,269 --> 00:58:00,314
Well, Benny fell into the water
near our home.

789
00:58:00,272 --> 00:58:03,483
And he was frozen
in the Skykomish River.

790
00:58:03,442 --> 00:58:04,651
In Washington.

791
00:58:04,693 --> 00:58:08,488
I went fishing, thinking he'd
been gone now for three months.

792
00:58:08,447 --> 00:58:11,992
And I see him
in a block office.

793
00:58:11,950 --> 00:58:15,078
He is thawed out now.
Is that correct?

794
00:58:15,829 --> 00:58:18,624
He's not moving a lot.
I'm worried.

795
00:58:18,582 --> 00:58:21,376
Should I get out some tongs?
I'm worried about the dog.

796
00:58:21,376 --> 00:58:24,755
No, he's fine. He's just lost
a little bit of his friskiness.

797
00:58:24,713 --> 00:58:26,673
I would think so, yeah.

798
00:58:26,715 --> 00:58:29,718
It's David.
I'm back in your life.

799
00:58:29,676 --> 00:58:32,262
I saw you earlier today.

800
00:58:32,304 --> 00:58:37,226
I was just watching
our old friend Benny the dog...

801
00:58:37,100 --> 00:58:38,560
on Conan...

802
00:58:39,895 --> 00:58:41,855
and I thought of you.

803
00:58:42,981 --> 00:58:44,441
Whatever.

804
00:58:46,610 --> 00:58:49,821
I loved seeing you today.

805
00:58:49,821 --> 00:58:52,658
So I will see you soon.

806
00:58:53,575 --> 00:58:55,577
You're a great dancer.

807
00:58:58,497 --> 00:58:59,957
Bye.

808
00:59:48,964 --> 00:59:51,633
- What you drinking'?
- Nothing.

809
00:59:51,633 --> 00:59:54,803
I'm in the mood for a cheap,
sugary, overpriced rum and Coke.

810
00:59:54,803 --> 00:59:57,347
- So you want one?
- Is there any other kind?

811
00:59:57,347 --> 00:59:59,433
I'll get us some.

812
00:59:59,474 --> 01:00:01,435
Where is the bathroom?

813
01:00:01,476 --> 01:00:05,189
It's behind--
over there by the place...

814
01:00:05,147 --> 01:00:07,649
by the girl who looks like Bjork.

815
01:00:07,649 --> 01:00:09,651
- I'll be right back.
- Maybe I should--

816
01:00:11,904 --> 01:00:15,199
Hey, man, you look good.
How's your book?

817
01:00:15,199 --> 01:00:18,118
- Take it off.
- No, this is a facial shield.

818
01:00:18,076 --> 01:00:21,747
It's an aesthetic prosthesis
these fucking doctors--

819
01:00:21,663 --> 01:00:24,082
Take off the mask, man.
It's freaking me out.

820
01:00:24,124 --> 01:00:25,542
I can't.

821
01:00:26,835 --> 01:00:29,838
It's my face.
This is my face.

822
01:00:29,796 --> 01:00:32,049
Trust me.
It's a little different.

823
01:00:32,090 --> 01:00:35,594
If you're embarrassed, just go.
Nobody asked you to chaperone.

824
01:00:36,637 --> 01:00:38,639
- Sofia asked me.
- What?

825
01:00:38,639 --> 01:00:41,183
She didn't want to be alone with me?
That's bullshit!

826
01:00:41,183 --> 01:00:44,269
Because I think I'm being pretty
fucking cool about this whole thing.

827
01:00:44,269 --> 01:00:46,271
Talk to a shrink.

828
01:00:46,271 --> 01:00:49,900
Or you can call me sometime
instead of hiding in your apartment.

829
01:00:49,816 --> 01:00:52,069
Don't take it out on a girl
you only met once.

830
01:00:54,071 --> 01:00:55,739
Did she say that--

831
01:00:55,781 --> 01:00:57,324
once?

832
01:00:57,366 --> 01:00:59,368
Did she say
that I met her once?

833
01:00:59,368 --> 01:01:01,203
Just cut it out, okay?

834
01:01:01,245 --> 01:01:03,872
I miss the old you.

835
01:01:03,872 --> 01:01:05,832
We all miss the old you...

836
01:01:05,874 --> 01:01:08,794
because the new guy is shit.

837
01:01:10,754 --> 01:01:13,090
That came out wrong.
I love you.

838
01:01:13,131 --> 01:01:14,967
Period.

839
01:01:15,008 --> 01:01:18,303
- How's your arm, man?
- Fuck you, Brian.

840
01:01:18,220 --> 01:01:20,305
How 'bout...

841
01:01:20,347 --> 01:01:21,974
no sympathy.

842
01:01:22,015 --> 01:01:24,518
How 'bout that's
the deal we make, okay?

843
01:01:35,612 --> 01:01:38,448
Give me a Budweiser
and a shot of tequila.

844
01:01:38,448 --> 01:01:40,742
What kind of tequila?

845
01:01:42,369 --> 01:01:46,206
- What did you say to me?
- I said, what kind of tequila?

846
01:01:47,291 --> 01:01:49,751
Why don't you ask me
to my face, bitch?

847
01:01:54,131 --> 01:01:56,466
Patron, if you have it.

848
01:02:25,829 --> 01:02:27,789
Another shot, another Bud.

849
01:02:27,789 --> 01:02:29,666
- This is on the house.
- Why?

850
01:02:29,708 --> 01:02:33,086
It just is, bitch.

851
01:03:23,970 --> 01:03:25,221
Patron!

852
01:03:34,356 --> 01:03:36,941
Dude, fix your fucking face.

853
01:04:28,994 --> 01:04:31,746
- Hello again.
- Hello again.

854
01:04:31,746 --> 01:04:32,831
Idea.

855
01:04:32,914 --> 01:04:34,874
Let's start over.

856
01:04:36,167 --> 01:04:39,921
How 'bout if you help me?
Unless I'm horning in here.

857
01:04:39,838 --> 01:04:42,007
Oh, you are,
but the food is good.

858
01:04:42,048 --> 01:04:45,760
See, I've got this little problem.
I've got a stalker.

859
01:04:47,470 --> 01:04:50,432
Doesn't sound life-threatening.
I need a cover.

860
01:04:50,432 --> 01:04:53,810
I need for you to pretend that we're
having a scintillating conversation...

861
01:04:53,768 --> 01:04:57,355
and you are wildly entertained.

862
01:04:57,314 --> 01:05:00,233
I know it's tough.
I'll improvise.

863
01:05:00,233 --> 01:05:01,985
I don't talk like that.

864
01:05:02,986 --> 01:05:06,865
She's right across the room.
She's burning a hole in my back now.

865
01:05:10,452 --> 01:05:13,330
Red dress, strappy shoes.

866
01:05:16,249 --> 01:05:17,709
That's right.

867
01:05:19,586 --> 01:05:22,589
I think she is the saddest girl...

868
01:05:22,589 --> 01:05:24,799
to ever hold a martini.

869
01:05:37,687 --> 01:05:39,689
- Are you okay?
- No.

870
01:05:40,815 --> 01:05:42,984
Why? What's wrong?
Is it me?

871
01:05:43,985 --> 01:05:46,488
- Is it me?
- I'll tell you later.

872
01:05:46,488 --> 01:05:49,574
- I'll tell you later.
- Something's wrong. Tell me now.

873
01:05:49,532 --> 01:05:51,493
Talk about it all right now.

874
01:05:51,493 --> 01:05:54,204
- Talk about it. Get it all out.
- I'll tell you later!

875
01:05:54,204 --> 01:05:56,331
Say everything now.

876
01:05:56,331 --> 01:06:00,085
Just say everything now.
Now! Now! Now!

877
01:06:00,043 --> 01:06:03,171
I'll tell you in another life,
when we are both cats.

878
01:06:09,386 --> 01:06:11,471
I can't believe
you just said that.

879
01:06:14,975 --> 01:06:17,644
That is the greatest thing
that I've ever heard.

880
01:06:17,644 --> 01:06:20,230
That's hilarious
that you said that.

881
01:06:21,231 --> 01:06:25,026
See, that-- You said that.

882
01:06:24,985 --> 01:06:27,737
That is what I love about you.

883
01:06:28,697 --> 01:06:31,241
That's hilarious.

884
01:06:31,241 --> 01:06:34,828
I'll tell you in another life,
when we are both cats.

885
01:06:35,912 --> 01:06:37,163
Cats!

886
01:06:37,247 --> 01:06:38,707
Cats!

887
01:06:44,087 --> 01:06:46,172
Well, this is where I leave you.

888
01:06:46,214 --> 01:06:48,174
I'll walk you to your door.

889
01:06:48,216 --> 01:06:50,844
- I live just around the corner.
- I've got my bike here.

890
01:06:50,802 --> 01:06:53,013
- I'd rather walk.
- Don't be a drag.

891
01:06:53,054 --> 01:06:55,724
Can't you see
she wants to go on her own?

892
01:06:55,682 --> 01:06:57,684
Shut up. You're drunk.

893
01:06:58,685 --> 01:07:02,188
I may be an idiot,
but I'm not drunk.

894
01:07:02,105 --> 01:07:05,150
Seriously, I don't need you
to walk me home.

895
01:07:05,108 --> 01:07:07,235
Thank you.

896
01:07:07,277 --> 01:07:11,031
Okay, then.
So we'll call you.

897
01:07:11,948 --> 01:07:14,909
We'll go catch a movie
or something.

898
01:07:16,161 --> 01:07:18,163
So we'll meet up soon.

899
01:07:21,374 --> 01:07:23,335
We'll meet up soon.

900
01:07:32,969 --> 01:07:35,847
We'll call you again
to go out with me!

901
01:07:37,223 --> 01:07:38,558
We'll call you.

902
01:07:39,809 --> 01:07:41,436
It's been a real blast.

903
01:07:41,478 --> 01:07:43,647
I bid you good evening.

904
01:07:43,688 --> 01:07:45,774
Wait, wait.
Where are you going?

905
01:07:45,774 --> 01:07:49,069
My bike-- it's back over there.
We'll hang soon.

906
01:07:48,985 --> 01:07:52,072
And bring your mask if you want.
I'm getting used to it.

907
01:07:53,865 --> 01:07:55,158
Wait a minute.

908
01:07:55,200 --> 01:07:56,785
What?

909
01:07:59,245 --> 01:08:01,164
I don't know.

910
01:08:01,206 --> 01:08:03,750
You drank a little too much.
Call me tomorrow if you want.

911
01:08:03,708 --> 01:08:06,294
Tomorrow I'll wish I was dead.

912
01:08:09,381 --> 01:08:11,466
No, you won't.
You just need to sleep.

913
01:08:17,430 --> 01:08:19,182
What?

914
01:08:23,561 --> 01:08:27,941
What did you say to Julie Gianni
the night of the accident?

915
01:08:28,984 --> 01:08:30,110
What?

916
01:08:30,860 --> 01:08:34,781
You told her
she was a fuck buddy.

917
01:08:34,739 --> 01:08:36,199
Never.

918
01:08:37,492 --> 01:08:40,954
She was a little more
than pissed about it.

919
01:08:40,870 --> 01:08:44,416
Have you been harboring
this shit all along?

920
01:08:44,416 --> 01:08:46,418
I never talked to her.

921
01:08:50,714 --> 01:08:52,173
Whatever.

922
01:08:54,676 --> 01:08:56,511
Anyway...

923
01:08:56,553 --> 01:08:59,889
who am I if I can't be the one
to tell you you're not ugly?

924
01:09:01,016 --> 01:09:02,767
Come on.

925
01:09:02,809 --> 01:09:05,770
Give me a courtesy laugh.

926
01:09:05,770 --> 01:09:08,773
Oh, Brian, I'm so fucked up.

927
01:09:08,773 --> 01:09:11,026
I'm just so fucked up.

928
01:09:13,028 --> 01:09:15,280
Hey, Brian, come on.

929
01:09:18,116 --> 01:09:20,076
We're best friends!

930
01:09:21,119 --> 01:09:22,495
We're bros!

931
01:09:23,455 --> 01:09:25,749
Come on, man, we're bros.

932
01:11:06,433 --> 01:11:08,018
Open your eyes.

933
01:11:14,399 --> 01:11:17,068
This is a cheap ploy
for sympathy.

934
01:11:17,819 --> 01:11:20,739
I'm okay. I'm okay.

935
01:11:20,697 --> 01:11:23,158
And it worked. Get up.

936
01:11:24,284 --> 01:11:25,827
I agree.

937
01:11:28,580 --> 01:11:30,957
This is a joke.

938
01:11:30,915 --> 01:11:33,626
I'm not gonna lie to you.

939
01:11:33,626 --> 01:11:35,337
I liked the way you looked.

940
01:11:36,338 --> 01:11:38,298
But...

941
01:11:38,340 --> 01:11:40,383
you have to pull it
the fuck together.

942
01:11:41,176 --> 01:11:44,429
Because if not,
I'll forget the other guy.

943
01:11:44,346 --> 01:11:48,099
You know that other guy?
You.

944
01:11:48,850 --> 01:11:51,895
I'm still that guy.
I'm still that guy.

945
01:11:51,853 --> 01:11:55,106
I don't have a mother-savior bone
in my body.

946
01:11:55,023 --> 01:11:58,652
It's not about that.
You are coming inside.

947
01:11:58,652 --> 01:12:01,404
But if this turns out
to be a big mistake...

948
01:12:02,489 --> 01:12:06,284
I do have the ability
to fall out of love with you...

949
01:12:06,242 --> 01:12:07,369
like that.

950
01:12:17,754 --> 01:12:19,756
We created
our own world together.

951
01:12:19,798 --> 01:12:21,466
- I am still that guy.
- Shut up.

952
01:12:21,508 --> 01:12:23,510
Us versus them.

953
01:12:23,551 --> 01:12:25,595
- Where's Brian?
- Brian?

954
01:12:25,637 --> 01:12:28,723
He went with you, didn't he?

955
01:12:28,682 --> 01:12:31,017
I thought you guys hooked up.

956
01:12:32,602 --> 01:12:35,772
I wish you hadn't gotten
in the car with that girl.

957
01:12:38,191 --> 01:12:40,402
Sofia, I--

958
01:12:43,530 --> 01:12:46,199
Your eyes apologize better.

959
01:12:47,951 --> 01:12:49,411
Come on.

960
01:12:50,537 --> 01:12:53,748
Holy God, this is going
to change my life...

961
01:12:53,707 --> 01:12:56,710
in a zillion different ways.

962
01:12:56,710 --> 01:12:58,795
I must be nuts.

963
01:12:58,837 --> 01:13:00,797
And we were quite a pair.

964
01:13:00,839 --> 01:13:04,092
Her believing in me,
me believing that...

965
01:13:04,050 --> 01:13:06,678
I actually deserved it.

966
01:13:24,821 --> 01:13:27,657
I see you haven't
been wasting your time.

967
01:13:28,700 --> 01:13:31,036
Do you ever draw
anything else?

968
01:13:34,831 --> 01:13:37,125
Did you sleep last night?

969
01:13:38,376 --> 01:13:40,670
No, I did not sleep.

970
01:13:40,670 --> 01:13:43,631
Got to leave early today,
so you'll have to be brief.

971
01:13:43,631 --> 01:13:46,760
Now, what can you tell me...

972
01:13:46,760 --> 01:13:49,220
about the name "Ellie"?

973
01:13:51,598 --> 01:13:53,475
Ellie.

974
01:13:53,516 --> 01:13:56,394
Is that a girl you knew,
a girl you were in love with?

975
01:13:56,353 --> 01:13:58,647
I've only been in love once.

976
01:13:58,688 --> 01:14:01,858
Apparently, you kept
repeating it last night.

977
01:14:01,816 --> 01:14:05,987
You did sleep, David.
Your advisor said you cried out.

978
01:14:05,904 --> 01:14:08,490
- You had a nightmare.
- Everything's a nightmare.

979
01:14:08,490 --> 01:14:13,161
You cried out for Ellie, David.
Do you remember what happened?

980
01:14:19,668 --> 01:14:21,419
Dig deep, David.

981
01:14:21,461 --> 01:14:23,380
Dig deep.

982
01:14:23,380 --> 01:14:26,675
You cried out for Ellie.
What do you remember about Ellie?

983
01:14:29,260 --> 01:14:31,388
Show me your face, David.

984
01:14:33,223 --> 01:14:36,267
Help me open the door.

985
01:14:45,694 --> 01:14:49,823
It's true you had an accident.
It's true you were disfigured.

986
01:14:49,739 --> 01:14:52,283
But not anymore.

987
01:14:52,325 --> 01:14:54,285
Do you remember?

988
01:14:56,287 --> 01:14:58,248
They did fix your face.

989
01:15:00,709 --> 01:15:03,628
Take off that mask, David.

990
01:15:03,586 --> 01:15:06,131
You'll see your face
is perfect under there.

991
01:15:07,298 --> 01:15:09,426
I never trusted the doctors.

992
01:15:11,636 --> 01:15:14,931
What happened next was surreal.

993
01:15:15,932 --> 01:15:19,311
That same arrogant bastard,
Dr. Pomeranz, called me.

994
01:15:19,269 --> 01:15:21,813
Suddenly he was
my new best friend.

995
01:15:21,855 --> 01:15:24,482
David! Hey, my brother.

996
01:15:24,482 --> 01:15:26,943
I felt really bad
about our last conversation.

997
01:15:26,901 --> 01:15:30,363
He said he'd discovered a new form
of reconstructive surgery...

998
01:15:30,322 --> 01:15:32,907
with the help of a doctor
from Berlin.

999
01:15:32,907 --> 01:15:34,159
Hello.

1000
01:15:34,242 --> 01:15:37,996
Next thing I knew, they shot me
full of drugs I'd never heard of...

1001
01:15:37,954 --> 01:15:40,623
and away we went.

1002
01:15:40,582 --> 01:15:44,794
What if God was one of us

1003
01:15:46,296 --> 01:15:50,342
Just a slob like one of us

1004
01:15:50,258 --> 01:15:53,553
Trying to make his way home

1005
01:15:53,470 --> 01:15:56,139
He's got a good voice.

1006
01:15:56,139 --> 01:15:57,390
Fifty-five.

1007
01:15:57,432 --> 01:15:59,768
The odds, they said,
were one in three...

1008
01:15:59,809 --> 01:16:02,270
that the headaches
could be reduced by 50 percent...

1009
01:16:02,270 --> 01:16:04,814
and facial tissue
could be regenerated.

1010
01:16:04,814 --> 01:16:09,527
The first to incorporate the concept
of endoscopic periorbital fiber optics.

1011
01:16:09,444 --> 01:16:11,154
Where are we gonna eat later?

1012
01:16:11,154 --> 01:16:13,239
I can't even tell you
what they did.

1013
01:16:13,281 --> 01:16:15,617
It seemed like
science fiction to me.

1014
01:16:15,617 --> 01:16:17,619
Madonna had that song,
" Borderline."

1015
01:16:17,619 --> 01:16:19,829
- That was a hell of a song.
- And another snip.

1016
01:16:19,829 --> 01:16:23,249
This is gonna be one
good-looking guy when I'm done.

1017
01:16:23,249 --> 01:16:25,669
Obviously, I was suspicious.

1018
01:16:26,836 --> 01:16:29,214
Wouldn't you be?

1019
01:16:29,255 --> 01:16:31,967
Suspicious of whom, of what?

1020
01:16:31,967 --> 01:16:33,093
Doc...

1021
01:16:33,134 --> 01:16:36,972
once you've been driven
off a bridge at 80 miles an hour...

1022
01:16:36,930 --> 01:16:41,142
somehow you don't invite happiness in
without a full body search.

1023
01:16:45,230 --> 01:16:47,649
At the risk of boring you...

1024
01:16:47,691 --> 01:16:50,193
I can present
the alternate argument.

1025
01:16:51,486 --> 01:16:53,738
I once knew a guy...

1026
01:16:53,738 --> 01:16:55,699
who was a real loner.

1027
01:16:56,783 --> 01:16:58,910
One day he woke up at 40...

1028
01:16:58,952 --> 01:17:01,955
with two daughters that
lit up his life with purpose...

1029
01:17:01,913 --> 01:17:05,041
and he suddenly goes
to endless school plays...

1030
01:17:05,041 --> 01:17:07,794
and he gets home at 9:20
for the evening discussion...

1031
01:17:07,752 --> 01:17:12,215
and he has the time of his life.

1032
01:17:12,173 --> 01:17:15,885
His favorite Beatle was once John,
and now it's Paul.

1033
01:17:18,722 --> 01:17:21,099
I always liked George.

1034
01:17:22,434 --> 01:17:25,854
It all depends on
the individual, doesn't it?

1035
01:17:25,854 --> 01:17:28,023
Tell me,
what's happiness for you?

1036
01:17:28,023 --> 01:17:30,275
What's happiness to you, David?

1037
01:17:31,693 --> 01:17:34,529
- How 'bout another question?
- You won't show me your face.

1038
01:17:34,487 --> 01:17:36,364
Will you?

1039
01:17:36,406 --> 01:17:40,285
So back to the time line.

1040
01:17:40,243 --> 01:17:42,495
Hurry. Let's move through this.

1041
01:17:47,751 --> 01:17:49,210
What?

1042
01:17:50,462 --> 01:17:52,464
You've got to take
the plates off.

1043
01:17:52,505 --> 01:17:54,924
I don't want to know
what's under here.

1044
01:17:54,966 --> 01:17:57,010
It's gonna be fine.
You'll see.

1045
01:17:57,010 --> 01:17:58,511
- I'll go tomorrow.
- Today.

1046
01:17:58,553 --> 01:18:00,889
I already called Pomeranz
and switched it to Wednesday.

1047
01:18:06,102 --> 01:18:07,228
What?

1048
01:18:09,648 --> 01:18:12,651
I hope that woman at the front desk
gave you shit about it.

1049
01:18:14,736 --> 01:18:18,448
Another day won't matter.
Besides, the Mustang will be fixed.

1050
01:18:18,406 --> 01:18:21,785
The plan was going in the Mustang.
The Mustang's not ready.

1051
01:18:21,743 --> 01:18:23,620
So we'll go tomorrow
in the Mustang.

1052
01:18:23,620 --> 01:18:26,039
- Good.
- We'll go when it's fixed.

1053
01:18:26,039 --> 01:18:28,249
I know that the problem...

1054
01:18:28,249 --> 01:18:32,420
wouldn't be you delaying
something you were dreading.

1055
01:18:34,255 --> 01:18:36,508
Couldn't be that.

1056
01:18:36,508 --> 01:18:38,510
Couldn't be that.

1057
01:18:40,595 --> 01:18:42,847
I mean--

1058
01:18:51,314 --> 01:18:54,359
I mean, I agree.

1059
01:18:56,528 --> 01:18:58,863
I think it's very important...

1060
01:18:58,822 --> 01:19:00,281
to have...

1061
01:19:02,826 --> 01:19:04,828
the right car...

1062
01:19:12,127 --> 01:19:14,170
to take you...

1063
01:19:16,131 --> 01:19:18,300
where you want to go...

1064
01:19:23,346 --> 01:19:25,724
24 hours a day.

1065
01:19:51,124 --> 01:19:53,126
How bad is it?

1066
01:19:56,421 --> 01:20:00,050
Well, your ears
are in the right place.

1067
01:20:02,510 --> 01:20:05,221
And the rest of it...

1068
01:20:07,265 --> 01:20:09,851
is not too bad at all.

1069
01:20:15,565 --> 01:20:17,108
It's perfect.

1070
01:21:07,909 --> 01:21:10,245
Do you love me?

1071
01:21:10,286 --> 01:21:12,539
I mean, really love me?

1072
01:21:12,539 --> 01:21:15,333
Because if you don't...

1073
01:21:15,375 --> 01:21:17,627
I'll just have to kill you.

1074
01:21:21,214 --> 01:21:23,216
You see, my next life?

1075
01:21:23,216 --> 01:21:25,051
In my next life...

1076
01:21:25,093 --> 01:21:27,637
I'm gonna come back
as this mole right here.

1077
01:21:29,055 --> 01:21:31,850
Seriously, this mole.

1078
01:21:31,850 --> 01:21:35,061
You'll have to wear bikini tops
to work and loose-fitting shirts...

1079
01:21:35,020 --> 01:21:37,605
so that I can breathe.

1080
01:21:38,648 --> 01:21:40,400
I love you.

1081
01:21:40,442 --> 01:21:41,901
Love you.

1082
01:21:44,154 --> 01:21:45,613
I love you.

1083
01:21:46,906 --> 01:21:49,868
I can live right there.

1084
01:21:54,706 --> 01:21:56,708
Is this a dream?

1085
01:21:57,709 --> 01:21:59,169
Absolutely.

1086
01:22:10,263 --> 01:22:13,516
We talked about the big things,
the little things...

1087
01:22:13,516 --> 01:22:15,477
and the big things.

1088
01:22:16,519 --> 01:22:19,064
But in truth, with Sofia...

1089
01:22:19,022 --> 01:22:21,900
it was the in-between times.

1090
01:22:44,714 --> 01:22:46,216
What did she say?

1091
01:22:47,175 --> 01:22:48,718
I have no idea.

1092
01:22:52,389 --> 01:22:54,391
- How's things, Brian?
- Fine.

1093
01:22:56,393 --> 01:22:58,895
- How's things?
- Don't flatter yourself.

1094
01:22:58,853 --> 01:23:00,480
I'm fine.

1095
01:23:00,563 --> 01:23:03,984
Besides, Sofia is great
but by no means one of a kind.

1096
01:23:03,900 --> 01:23:05,902
She was a proximity infatuation.

1097
01:23:08,363 --> 01:23:11,491
And don't use that. It's mine.
Thanks.

1098
01:23:12,534 --> 01:23:14,536
Where'd you get this camera?

1099
01:23:14,536 --> 01:23:17,914
I'm into things.
You have no idea, my friend.

1100
01:23:19,374 --> 01:23:21,626
Just as long as you're okay.

1101
01:23:21,584 --> 01:23:23,837
And anyway,
we're friends, aren't we?

1102
01:23:23,878 --> 01:23:26,047
- Always.
- That's right.

1103
01:23:37,726 --> 01:23:39,728
What's up with your face?

1104
01:23:41,479 --> 01:23:43,106
- Fuck!
- What?

1105
01:23:43,106 --> 01:23:45,025
There's a seam opening!

1106
01:23:50,905 --> 01:23:54,117
- David Aames.
- You fucking asshole.

1107
01:23:54,868 --> 01:23:56,745
I know.

1108
01:25:17,242 --> 01:25:19,202
Was I snoring?

1109
01:25:22,831 --> 01:25:25,041
I think it was me.

1110
01:25:25,083 --> 01:25:27,043
I was thirsty, that's all.

1111
01:25:30,088 --> 01:25:32,173
I'm dreaming about you.

1112
01:26:47,791 --> 01:26:50,710
I could listen to you say "mmm"...

1113
01:26:50,710 --> 01:26:52,962
for the rest of my life.

1114
01:27:05,308 --> 01:27:07,394
Baby, what's wrong?

1115
01:27:12,649 --> 01:27:15,151
Where is she?

1116
01:27:15,110 --> 01:27:16,236
Who?

1117
01:27:20,573 --> 01:27:22,367
Who?

1118
01:27:48,601 --> 01:27:50,061
I'm Sofia.

1119
01:27:54,816 --> 01:27:58,320
Now, I'm gonna make sure
that I tie it four times.

1120
01:27:58,320 --> 01:28:00,280
You know why, Julie?

1121
01:28:00,322 --> 01:28:03,283
Because four times
really means something.

1122
01:28:03,283 --> 01:28:05,702
David, don't hurt me.

1123
01:28:05,702 --> 01:28:08,455
I'm freaked out.
It worked.

1124
01:28:08,455 --> 01:28:10,582
You know you're not
gonna get away with this...

1125
01:28:10,582 --> 01:28:12,292
so tell me now,
where is Sofia.

1126
01:28:13,335 --> 01:28:15,128
I am Sofia.

1127
01:28:16,087 --> 01:28:17,797
- Where's Sofia?
- I am Sofia!

1128
01:28:17,839 --> 01:28:20,342
- Where is she?
- I am Sofia!

1129
01:28:20,300 --> 01:28:22,886
I'm calling the police,
and you can tell it to them.

1130
01:28:22,886 --> 01:28:25,263
- You survived the accident.
- What accident?

1131
01:28:25,263 --> 01:28:28,808
Whose body was it?
It was the Seven Dwarfs.

1132
01:28:28,808 --> 01:28:31,645
- I wasn't in an accident.
- You're trying to steal my life!

1133
01:28:31,645 --> 01:28:33,855
Of course you weren't
in an accident.

1134
01:28:33,855 --> 01:28:36,483
Now it's fucking attempted murder!

1135
01:28:36,524 --> 01:28:39,069
I'm Sofia. Please.

1136
01:28:40,111 --> 01:28:42,947
Tell it to them.

1137
01:28:42,947 --> 01:28:45,241
This is David Aames.

1138
01:28:45,283 --> 01:28:46,743
I need help.

1139
01:28:46,785 --> 01:28:49,245
I have an intruder--
I've captured an intruder...

1140
01:28:49,245 --> 01:28:50,830
who's entered my home.

1141
01:28:50,830 --> 01:28:53,875
God. Wake up, man.

1142
01:28:56,544 --> 01:28:57,879
Are you for real?

1143
01:29:07,180 --> 01:29:10,392
Kept me waiting here for three hours.
They won't even tell me any news.

1144
01:29:10,392 --> 01:29:12,852
These guys think that I had
something to do with this.

1145
01:29:12,811 --> 01:29:14,854
Give us a minute here, yeah?

1146
01:29:14,896 --> 01:29:18,775
Detective Larson, Detective Andrews,
thanks very much.

1147
01:29:20,986 --> 01:29:23,029
They think that I had
something to do with this.

1148
01:29:23,071 --> 01:29:26,116
I'm gonna handle this exactly
the way your father would.

1149
01:29:27,200 --> 01:29:28,702
I've got it solved.

1150
01:29:29,411 --> 01:29:31,538
You got it solved?

1151
01:29:31,579 --> 01:29:33,415
Where is she?

1152
01:29:34,457 --> 01:29:38,420
She's gonna be fine.
Now, this whole file is gonna--

1153
01:29:41,756 --> 01:29:44,050
Thank God you're here, man.

1154
01:29:44,050 --> 01:29:45,677
It's okay.

1155
01:29:46,594 --> 01:29:49,639
- I love her.
- Yeah.

1156
01:29:49,597 --> 01:29:53,310
Right now I want you to look at these
photos, then I'm gonna destroy them.

1157
01:29:53,268 --> 01:29:55,937
Sofia's testimony
is also in here.

1158
01:29:55,937 --> 01:29:58,690
It won't exist.

1159
01:29:58,648 --> 01:30:01,192
She's not gonna press charges.

1160
01:30:03,528 --> 01:30:05,780
Press charges against me?

1161
01:30:05,822 --> 01:30:08,366
David, wake up.

1162
01:30:11,119 --> 01:30:13,121
Now, as a friend...

1163
01:30:14,539 --> 01:30:17,250
I think you should see
what you did to Sofia.

1164
01:30:20,295 --> 01:30:21,171
The press won't get hold of this
if you get away quickly.

1165
01:30:21,129 --> 01:30:23,381
The press won't get hold of this
if you get away quickly.

1166
01:30:25,925 --> 01:30:28,845
Tommy, this is Julie.
This is not Sofia.

1167
01:30:29,929 --> 01:30:32,515
This is Julie Gianni.

1168
01:30:33,433 --> 01:30:36,519
I didn't do this to her.
Tommy, someone's setting me up.

1169
01:30:36,478 --> 01:30:40,732
David, the board and I
have taken care of everything.

1170
01:30:40,649 --> 01:30:44,611
Okay, they've been really great,
really great, actually.

1171
01:30:44,569 --> 01:30:46,905
All this is gonna disappear.

1172
01:30:48,365 --> 01:30:51,201
We're all behind you,
even the board.

1173
01:31:03,380 --> 01:31:05,465
Get out of here.

1174
01:31:09,052 --> 01:31:11,513
This is a revolution
of the mind.

1175
01:31:20,397 --> 01:31:22,565
You're in fuckin' sad shape!

1176
01:31:23,566 --> 01:31:25,568
Don't fucking ever hit a girl.

1177
01:31:25,527 --> 01:31:28,655
Hit me, but don't fucking ever
hit a girl!

1178
01:31:28,613 --> 01:31:30,615
Listen to me.
It wasn't Sofia.

1179
01:31:30,615 --> 01:31:33,159
It was Julie.

1180
01:31:33,201 --> 01:31:36,329
- It was Julie.
- It was Julie Gianni.

1181
01:31:36,287 --> 01:31:38,289
Yes.

1182
01:31:38,331 --> 01:31:41,835
So Sofia was abducted by Julie...

1183
01:31:41,835 --> 01:31:44,838
and now Julie is posing
as Sofia.

1184
01:31:47,549 --> 01:31:50,760
You're in O.J. land, man.

1185
01:31:50,719 --> 01:31:53,013
Julie Gianni is fucking dead!

1186
01:31:53,013 --> 01:31:57,642
I don't care what they told you,
I can assure you Julie Gianni is alive.

1187
01:31:57,559 --> 01:31:59,853
- She is alive.
- I didn't talk to them.

1188
01:31:59,853 --> 01:32:02,147
I talked to Sofia.

1189
01:32:03,773 --> 01:32:05,900
- Where is she?
- I just dropped Sofia off.

1190
01:32:05,942 --> 01:32:07,819
I saw everything you did to her.

1191
01:32:07,819 --> 01:32:11,031
Let me tell you something.
I did not do that to her.

1192
01:32:12,032 --> 01:32:14,951
Look at me.
Look me in the eye.

1193
01:32:14,951 --> 01:32:17,287
You tell me that's the girl
you brought to the party.

1194
01:32:17,287 --> 01:32:20,415
You tell me that
that's your dream girl...

1195
01:32:20,332 --> 01:32:22,667
your proximity infatuation.

1196
01:32:22,709 --> 01:32:24,502
Yes!

1197
01:32:24,502 --> 01:32:26,671
And you stole her from me.

1198
01:32:26,713 --> 01:32:30,091
The one girl I really wanted,
and you took her from me.

1199
01:32:30,050 --> 01:32:33,720
You're insane.
You're losin' it, man.

1200
01:32:33,720 --> 01:32:37,724
- You have revealed yourself.
- Oh, yeah.

1201
01:32:37,641 --> 01:32:39,643
I'm with them.

1202
01:32:44,981 --> 01:32:47,275
Where'd you get the coat, Brian?

1203
01:32:48,318 --> 01:32:50,654
Where'd you get the camera?

1204
01:32:50,654 --> 01:32:52,864
How much did they pay you?

1205
01:32:53,823 --> 01:32:57,285
Listen to me, 'cause this is
the last time we're ever gonna speak.

1206
01:32:58,286 --> 01:33:00,038
I was your only friend.

1207
01:33:00,080 --> 01:33:02,832
You have revealed yourself to me.

1208
01:33:25,939 --> 01:33:27,399
Problems?

1209
01:33:28,858 --> 01:33:31,903
I'm in no mood to be fucked with,
so do yourself a favor--

1210
01:33:31,903 --> 01:33:35,156
There's an explanation
for all this, David.

1211
01:33:36,616 --> 01:33:40,453
You and I know each other.
You found me on the Internet.

1212
01:33:41,746 --> 01:33:43,915
I'm here to help you, David.

1213
01:33:46,459 --> 01:33:50,046
Who the fuck are you?
Why are you following me?

1214
01:33:50,046 --> 01:33:54,342
First of all, it's very important
that you calm down.

1215
01:33:55,635 --> 01:33:57,095
Calm down?

1216
01:33:58,680 --> 01:34:00,098
Calm down.

1217
01:34:00,098 --> 01:34:02,642
You must overcome your fears
and regain control.

1218
01:34:02,684 --> 01:34:05,186
Take a hold of your life again,
David.

1219
01:34:05,145 --> 01:34:07,147
It's as easy
as holding that glass.

1220
01:34:08,148 --> 01:34:11,443
What if I were to tell you
that you can take control...

1221
01:34:11,401 --> 01:34:13,570
of all of this, everything?

1222
01:34:13,528 --> 01:34:14,988
Even me.

1223
01:34:16,573 --> 01:34:18,742
Look, I'm straight. Okay?

1224
01:34:22,829 --> 01:34:24,789
David, look at all these people.

1225
01:34:25,832 --> 01:34:28,335
Seems as though they're just
all chatting away, doesn't it?

1226
01:34:28,335 --> 01:34:29,419
Yeah.

1227
01:34:29,502 --> 01:34:31,755
- Nothing to do with you.
- No.

1228
01:34:31,796 --> 01:34:33,381
And yet...

1229
01:34:33,423 --> 01:34:37,302
maybe they're only here because
you wanted them to be here.

1230
01:34:38,303 --> 01:34:39,638
You are their god.

1231
01:34:39,721 --> 01:34:44,351
Not only that, but you can make them
obey you or even destroy you.

1232
01:34:45,268 --> 01:34:49,606
Well, what I'd love for them to do
is shut the fuck up.

1233
01:34:49,564 --> 01:34:51,191
Especially you.

1234
01:35:03,119 --> 01:35:05,205
You see?

1235
01:35:17,217 --> 01:35:20,136
You and I
signed a contract, David.

1236
01:35:20,136 --> 01:35:24,224
Who is the man in the restaurant?
Who is it?

1237
01:35:25,016 --> 01:35:26,685
I can't--

1238
01:35:26,726 --> 01:35:28,770
Can you tell the difference
between dreams and reality?

1239
01:35:28,770 --> 01:35:31,481
- Of course. Can you?
- Think about it.

1240
01:35:32,232 --> 01:35:34,317
Think with your head.

1241
01:35:34,484 --> 01:35:36,361
You signed a contract...

1242
01:35:36,569 --> 01:35:38,029
did you not?

1243
01:35:39,864 --> 01:35:41,449
I signed something.

1244
01:35:41,449 --> 01:35:43,451
Was the man
in the restaurant there?

1245
01:35:45,286 --> 01:35:48,832
- Fuck--
- Accept your body's resistance.

1246
01:35:48,832 --> 01:35:51,209
Let your head answer.

1247
01:35:52,210 --> 01:35:53,962
Sign the contract, David.

1248
01:35:54,004 --> 01:35:55,463
- Yes.
- That's right.

1249
01:35:56,089 --> 01:35:57,132
Who is Ellie?

1250
01:36:00,343 --> 01:36:03,179
- I don't know what's real.
- What happened that night?

1251
01:36:03,179 --> 01:36:06,766
- Somebody died.
- I don't want to remember.

1252
01:36:06,725 --> 01:36:08,852
You hold the keys
to this prison.

1253
01:36:09,686 --> 01:36:11,688
- It wasn't Sofia.
- Who was it?

1254
01:36:12,439 --> 01:36:13,398
- No.
- Who was it?

1255
01:36:17,402 --> 01:36:19,738
I'm afraid of
how powerful this is.

1256
01:36:21,114 --> 01:36:23,742
You wanna let it out,
don't you, David?

1257
01:36:26,745 --> 01:36:28,538
You're about to tell me.

1258
01:36:29,748 --> 01:36:31,750
Tell me...

1259
01:36:31,791 --> 01:36:35,754
what your heart and soul
will not allow you to forget.

1260
01:36:38,381 --> 01:36:40,342
Did you kill Sofia?

1261
01:37:32,060 --> 01:37:34,270
I thought you were a vandal.

1262
01:37:36,022 --> 01:37:38,858
Who are you?

1263
01:37:42,737 --> 01:37:44,280
I'm Sofia.

1264
01:37:46,408 --> 01:37:48,368
You are not...

1265
01:37:48,410 --> 01:37:49,703
Sofia.

1266
01:37:56,167 --> 01:37:57,585
I'm Sofia.

1267
01:37:57,669 --> 01:37:59,170
Whatever.

1268
01:37:59,212 --> 01:38:01,965
We're gonna be together again.

1269
01:38:01,923 --> 01:38:05,969
You're gonna forget about Juliana
and we're gonna be together.

1270
01:38:05,927 --> 01:38:07,804
I'm not gonna be afraid
of you anymore.

1271
01:38:09,014 --> 01:38:12,392
I'm gonna get you a cold towel.
I'll be right back.

1272
01:38:13,226 --> 01:38:14,686
I love you.

1273
01:38:34,039 --> 01:38:36,124
Pleasure delayer.

1274
01:38:44,841 --> 01:38:45,967
Sofia?

1275
01:39:05,320 --> 01:39:06,780
I am Sofia.

1276
01:39:13,370 --> 01:39:14,829
I love you.

1277
01:39:16,164 --> 01:39:18,416
Oh, I missed you so much.

1278
01:39:28,009 --> 01:39:29,469
Where were you?

1279
01:39:35,183 --> 01:39:36,935
Forget it.

1280
01:39:36,977 --> 01:39:38,979
I don't need to know.

1281
01:39:39,980 --> 01:39:41,982
It doesn't matter.

1282
01:39:43,692 --> 01:39:45,819
Just tell me that you love me.

1283
01:39:51,449 --> 01:39:52,659
I love you.

1284
01:39:55,745 --> 01:39:58,123
What is happiness to you, David?

1285
01:39:59,124 --> 01:40:00,333
For me...

1286
01:40:00,417 --> 01:40:02,669
it's being here with you.

1287
01:40:08,842 --> 01:40:10,927
What the fuck...

1288
01:40:10,927 --> 01:40:13,346
is happening?

1289
01:40:15,974 --> 01:40:18,184
What is fucking happening?

1290
01:40:18,226 --> 01:40:21,146
David was a real delight
as a child.

1291
01:40:24,733 --> 01:40:25,859
Oh, God!

1292
01:40:25,942 --> 01:40:29,362
I'm so afraid
of how powerful this is!

1293
01:40:30,405 --> 01:40:32,824
Oh, David!

1294
01:41:02,812 --> 01:41:05,815
That is the greatest thing
I've overheard.

1295
01:41:07,651 --> 01:41:10,278
In another life
when we are both cats.

1296
01:41:16,701 --> 01:41:17,911
What's happening?

1297
01:41:20,413 --> 01:41:22,457
Hey, man, what's happening?

1298
01:41:26,586 --> 01:41:28,755
You bitch!

1299
01:41:30,757 --> 01:41:33,969
I don't wanna see your face!

1300
01:42:42,370 --> 01:42:44,372
I did it, didn't I?

1301
01:42:46,916 --> 01:42:49,961
But I don't feel
like I killed someone.

1302
01:42:53,089 --> 01:42:54,883
- David...
- I feel like...

1303
01:42:54,924 --> 01:42:57,761
- who was the man...
- I'm in a dream.

1304
01:42:57,719 --> 01:42:59,721
at the restaurant?

1305
01:43:17,947 --> 01:43:19,741
Sometimes...

1306
01:43:19,783 --> 01:43:22,118
the mind behaves
as if it were in a dream.

1307
01:43:22,118 --> 01:43:25,288
Faces change.
People become other people.

1308
01:43:27,290 --> 01:43:29,959
The subconscious
is a powerful thing.

1309
01:43:32,087 --> 01:43:34,589
You treated Julie carelessly,
didn't you?

1310
01:43:44,641 --> 01:43:48,728
Your feelings of responsibility
or guilt over Julie...

1311
01:43:48,645 --> 01:43:51,147
might have easily
turned Sofia into Julie.

1312
01:43:54,359 --> 01:43:56,319
Do you know what derangement is?

1313
01:43:57,195 --> 01:43:59,656
I need your help.

1314
01:44:00,865 --> 01:44:03,785
All I know is,
you killed your girlfriend...

1315
01:44:03,785 --> 01:44:06,746
and I don't know
what's in your mind.

1316
01:44:06,705 --> 01:44:08,289
I need your help.

1317
01:44:08,289 --> 01:44:12,544
I would work on this case forever
if I could, but we're out of time.

1318
01:44:17,674 --> 01:44:19,134
What will you plead?

1319
01:44:23,221 --> 01:44:24,681
Temporary derangement.

1320
01:44:26,599 --> 01:44:28,518
That's your best chance.

1321
01:44:30,145 --> 01:44:32,731
I don't think they'll believe me.

1322
01:44:33,690 --> 01:44:35,525
What do you believe?

1323
01:44:37,444 --> 01:44:39,946
Believe it or not,
I care about you.

1324
01:44:44,576 --> 01:44:47,287
You've become like family to me.

1325
01:44:50,457 --> 01:44:55,045
I don't want to give up on you,
David, but I needed more.

1326
01:44:54,961 --> 01:44:56,838
I needed--

1327
01:44:56,838 --> 01:44:59,049
I needed an answer.

1328
01:44:59,090 --> 01:45:02,344
I mean, I even thought there was
more than a good chance...

1329
01:45:02,344 --> 01:45:04,304
somebody was playing
a trick on you.

1330
01:45:04,346 --> 01:45:06,723
Maybe it was the board.

1331
01:45:06,723 --> 01:45:09,559
But I can't exceed my duties.

1332
01:45:14,481 --> 01:45:16,441
I'm just a psychologist.

1333
01:45:18,943 --> 01:45:21,404
And I have to go now.

1334
01:45:24,824 --> 01:45:27,619
Will I see you at the trial?

1335
01:45:28,787 --> 01:45:30,246
No, I'm--

1336
01:45:31,289 --> 01:45:33,291
I'm just the opening act.

1337
01:45:52,143 --> 01:45:56,731
Reassurance is our specialty.
That is the Life Extension credo.

1338
01:46:05,198 --> 01:46:08,326
Benny is a dog who was frozen
for three months...

1339
01:46:08,326 --> 01:46:10,537
and thawed out
to live a normal life.

1340
01:46:10,578 --> 01:46:14,374
Life Extension can translate
to the human form too.

1341
01:46:15,458 --> 01:46:17,877
How do you accomplish
such a thing?

1342
01:46:17,877 --> 01:46:21,131
Seventy-two cryonized patients...

1343
01:46:21,089 --> 01:46:24,592
are currently held at our facility
in New Brunswick.

1344
01:46:24,551 --> 01:46:29,180
And we feature the finest scientific
technicians on the planet.

1345
01:46:32,726 --> 01:46:34,352
McCabe!

1346
01:46:39,024 --> 01:46:41,026
Come back!

1347
01:47:17,771 --> 01:47:19,856
Life Extension Corporation,
please.

1348
01:47:19,856 --> 01:47:21,941
- Can I help you?
- LE.

1349
01:47:21,983 --> 01:47:23,943
We hold a court order.

1350
01:47:26,279 --> 01:47:28,281
I think I've been here before.

1351
01:47:41,544 --> 01:47:43,046
Her name is Libby.

1352
01:47:43,088 --> 01:47:44,714
Good morning, Mr. McCabe.

1353
01:47:45,507 --> 01:47:48,009
I'm Libby.
I'm here to assist you.

1354
01:47:49,594 --> 01:47:52,597
He's my son.
He's very shy.

1355
01:47:52,555 --> 01:47:57,102
You're not with the media or a part
of any legal consortium, correct?

1356
01:47:57,060 --> 01:47:58,520
No.

1357
01:47:59,104 --> 01:48:01,022
Welcome to Life Extension.

1358
01:48:01,064 --> 01:48:04,067
Take a look at our proposal.
Please follow me.

1359
01:48:04,067 --> 01:48:06,027
You can wait out here.

1360
01:48:07,070 --> 01:48:09,406
You'll be meeting
Rebecca Dearborn...

1361
01:48:09,364 --> 01:48:11,533
my personal role model.

1362
01:48:13,493 --> 01:48:16,496
I didn't need the pain anymore.
I already experienced that.

1363
01:48:16,496 --> 01:48:20,083
They want you to lay down and die.
Life Extension wants you to live.

1364
01:48:22,669 --> 01:48:26,047
I don 't think that God
disapproves of this.

1365
01:48:26,006 --> 01:48:29,718
"Cryonization:
a journey of reawakening...

1366
01:48:29,676 --> 01:48:32,178
after the preservation of the human
body at extremely low temperatures."

1367
01:48:32,137 --> 01:48:34,848
They laughed at Jules Verne too.

1368
01:48:34,848 --> 01:48:36,433
You are not--

1369
01:48:36,516 --> 01:48:39,519
Mr. McCabe, how are you?
I'm Rebecca Dearborn.

1370
01:48:42,522 --> 01:48:47,068
Life Extension,
or LE as we like to refer to it...

1371
01:48:46,985 --> 01:48:48,570
is a glimpse of the future.

1372
01:48:49,195 --> 01:48:50,447
It's a ticket.

1373
01:48:50,488 --> 01:48:54,492
Not in the juvenile sense, but
in the deeply meaningful sense...

1374
01:48:54,409 --> 01:48:56,745
that can only be born
in the human heart.

1375
01:48:59,873 --> 01:49:02,709
The DNA codes of the human body
have been broken.

1376
01:49:02,667 --> 01:49:05,211
Soon, heart ailments, cancer...

1377
01:49:05,211 --> 01:49:07,339
so much more
will be a thing of the past.

1378
01:49:08,048 --> 01:49:11,551
Very simply,
your anguish, your discontent...

1379
01:49:11,551 --> 01:49:14,220
even your death
is no longer necessary...

1380
01:49:14,220 --> 01:49:16,014
in a traditional sense.

1381
01:49:16,056 --> 01:49:20,518
Whatever malady hides behind
that mask, it's temporary.

1382
01:49:21,603 --> 01:49:23,605
Within an hour of your passing...

1383
01:49:23,605 --> 01:49:26,858
LE will transfer your body
to a vessel...

1384
01:49:26,816 --> 01:49:31,613
where you will be sealed and frozen
at 196 degrees below zero.

1385
01:49:31,529 --> 01:49:33,531
Power outages, earthquakes--

1386
01:49:33,573 --> 01:49:36,159
nothing will affect
your suspension hibernation.

1387
01:49:36,159 --> 01:49:39,329
Did you sign a contract
with these people, David?

1388
01:49:42,540 --> 01:49:45,001
What's the Lucid Dream option?

1389
01:49:45,502 --> 01:49:47,587
Good choice.

1390
01:49:47,629 --> 01:49:51,132
The Lucid Dream
is Life Extension's newest option.

1391
01:49:51,091 --> 01:49:52,884
For a little extra...

1392
01:49:52,926 --> 01:49:56,304
we offer the cryonic union...

1393
01:49:56,262 --> 01:49:59,182
of science and entertainment.

1394
01:50:00,100 --> 01:50:02,060
"Cryo-tainment."

1395
01:50:06,022 --> 01:50:08,149
Some find this presentation
helpful.

1396
01:50:14,114 --> 01:50:19,119
I have a universe

1397
01:50:18,994 --> 01:50:21,496
Inside me

1398
01:50:21,538 --> 01:50:24,290
Portrait of a modern human life.

1399
01:50:24,290 --> 01:50:26,835
American, male...

1400
01:50:26,835 --> 01:50:29,838
birth and death.

1401
01:50:29,754 --> 01:50:33,300
Imagine that you are suffering
from a terminal illness.

1402
01:50:33,258 --> 01:50:36,803
You'd like to be cryonized,
but you'd rather be resurrected...

1403
01:50:36,761 --> 01:50:40,140
to continue your own life
as you know it now.

1404
01:50:40,098 --> 01:50:42,934
LE offers you the answer.

1405
01:50:43,435 --> 01:50:45,061
Upon resurrection...

1406
01:50:45,103 --> 01:50:47,772
you will continue
in an ageless state...

1407
01:50:47,772 --> 01:50:50,900
preserved
but living in the present...

1408
01:50:50,900 --> 01:50:53,028
with a future
of your choosing.

1409
01:50:53,737 --> 01:50:56,740
Your death will be wiped
from your memory.

1410
01:50:56,740 --> 01:50:59,743
Your life will continue as
a realistic work of art...

1411
01:50:59,743 --> 01:51:02,162
painted by you,
minute to minute...

1412
01:51:02,162 --> 01:51:06,124
and you'll live it with the
romantic abandon of a summer day...

1413
01:51:06,041 --> 01:51:08,835
with the feeling
of a great movie...

1414
01:51:08,793 --> 01:51:11,296
or a pop song you always loved--

1415
01:51:11,338 --> 01:51:13,256
with no memory
of how it all occurred...

1416
01:51:13,256 --> 01:51:15,216
save for the knowledge...

1417
01:51:15,258 --> 01:51:19,512
that everything simply improved.

1418
01:51:19,471 --> 01:51:21,431
In any instance
of discontent...

1419
01:51:21,473 --> 01:51:24,309
you'll be visited
by technical support.

1420
01:51:24,309 --> 01:51:26,144
It's all just around the corner.

1421
01:51:26,144 --> 01:51:31,775
The day after tomorrow,
another chapter begins seamlessly.

1422
01:51:31,650 --> 01:51:33,652
A living dream.

1423
01:51:33,652 --> 01:51:36,237
Life Extension 's promise to you.

1424
01:51:36,237 --> 01:51:38,239
Life, part two.

1425
01:51:38,239 --> 01:51:40,075
A living dream.

1426
01:51:42,911 --> 01:51:46,539
"Your death will be
wiped from your memory."

1427
01:51:46,498 --> 01:51:48,625
I guess I missed that one
in USA Today.

1428
01:51:48,667 --> 01:51:49,751
A dream.

1429
01:51:52,504 --> 01:51:55,590
What if there was a mistake?

1430
01:51:55,548 --> 01:51:58,718
What if the dream
became a nightmare?

1431
01:51:59,844 --> 01:52:03,556
Of course your subconscious
can always play tricks on you.

1432
01:52:05,100 --> 01:52:08,228
The subconscious
is a very powerful thing.

1433
01:52:12,148 --> 01:52:14,901
Did you sign a contract
with these people, David?

1434
01:52:14,901 --> 01:52:17,404
But this is a serious business.

1435
01:52:19,072 --> 01:52:22,575
The Lucid Dream
is worth the risk.

1436
01:52:23,410 --> 01:52:26,246
And what is any life
if not the pursuit of a dream?

1437
01:52:27,247 --> 01:52:28,748
The dream of peace...

1438
01:52:28,832 --> 01:52:31,501
the dream of achievement...

1439
01:52:33,003 --> 01:52:36,339
the dream of hearing someone
say these words...

1440
01:52:36,339 --> 01:52:38,717
when they really,
truly mean them.

1441
01:52:41,678 --> 01:52:43,805
I love you, David.

1442
01:52:47,392 --> 01:52:48,268
I love you.

1443
01:52:52,188 --> 01:52:54,107
Roam free, David.

1444
01:52:54,107 --> 01:52:56,985
Most of us
live our whole lives...

1445
01:52:56,985 --> 01:53:00,322
without any real adventure
to call our own.

1446
01:53:00,280 --> 01:53:03,199
It's hard to comprehend.

1447
01:53:03,199 --> 01:53:06,077
But they laughed
at Jules Verne too.

1448
01:53:08,538 --> 01:53:09,873
This...

1449
01:53:09,914 --> 01:53:11,374
is a revolution...

1450
01:53:11,416 --> 01:53:13,043
of the mind.

1451
01:53:33,897 --> 01:53:35,690
I wanna wake up!

1452
01:53:36,650 --> 01:53:38,193
Tech support!

1453
01:53:39,069 --> 01:53:40,362
Hey! Face!

1454
01:53:42,197 --> 01:53:44,783
It's a nightmare!

1455
01:54:01,257 --> 01:54:04,552
Tech support!

1456
01:54:19,526 --> 01:54:23,738
Tech support!

1457
01:54:59,232 --> 01:55:00,734
David Aames.

1458
01:55:02,027 --> 01:55:04,529
I think it's time we had
a proper reintroduction.

1459
01:55:04,529 --> 01:55:07,824
I'm Edmund Ventura
from the Oasis Project.

1460
01:55:07,824 --> 01:55:10,243
Formerly Life Extension, LE.

1461
01:55:10,243 --> 01:55:12,329
- Tech support.
- Yes.

1462
01:55:12,370 --> 01:55:14,372
Yes, I'm your tech support...

1463
01:55:14,372 --> 01:55:17,917
and we first met
150 years ago.

1464
01:55:17,876 --> 01:55:20,295
Oh, shit.

1465
01:55:20,337 --> 01:55:22,505
You sold me the Lucid Dream.

1466
01:55:24,591 --> 01:55:26,384
What the hell happened?

1467
01:55:26,384 --> 01:55:28,845
I tried to warn you in the bar.

1468
01:55:28,803 --> 01:55:33,141
I told you you must exercise control,
that it all depended on your mind.

1469
01:55:33,600 --> 01:55:35,185
All of this...

1470
01:55:35,226 --> 01:55:37,520
everything is your creation.

1471
01:55:37,520 --> 01:55:40,565
And now we're heading toward
your true moment of choice.

1472
01:55:41,441 --> 01:55:43,234
True moment of choice?

1473
01:55:43,234 --> 01:55:44,361
Yes.

1474
01:55:49,491 --> 01:55:51,576
When did the Lucid Dream begin?

1475
01:55:51,618 --> 01:55:53,620
Remember the day
of the nightclub?

1476
01:55:53,620 --> 01:55:55,038
We'll meet up soon.

1477
01:55:56,831 --> 01:56:00,502
That night, after Sofia left you and
you fell asleep on the pavement...

1478
01:56:00,502 --> 01:56:03,922
that was the moment
that you chose for the splice.

1479
01:56:03,838 --> 01:56:06,758
- Splice?
- Splice.

1480
01:56:06,758 --> 01:56:10,512
The end of your real life and
the beginning of LE's Lucid Dream.

1481
01:56:10,470 --> 01:56:13,515
A splice of many, many years
which passed...

1482
01:56:13,431 --> 01:56:15,892
while you were frozen
and dreaming.

1483
01:56:15,892 --> 01:56:18,228
From the moment
you woke up on that street...

1484
01:56:18,269 --> 01:56:20,563
nothing was real
in the traditional sense.

1485
01:56:20,522 --> 01:56:22,023
Open your eyes.

1486
01:56:22,107 --> 01:56:25,110
Your Lucid Dream
is monitored by Life Extension...

1487
01:56:25,110 --> 01:56:28,446
and a panel of experts who are
following your every thought...

1488
01:56:28,363 --> 01:56:30,407
even at this moment.

1489
01:56:32,492 --> 01:56:34,619
Forgive me.
I'm blowing your mind.

1490
01:56:38,581 --> 01:56:40,583
I'm not a big fan of heights.

1491
01:56:41,960 --> 01:56:43,503
I know.

1492
01:56:43,586 --> 01:56:45,964
We erased what really happened
from your memory.

1493
01:56:46,881 --> 01:56:49,467
- Erased?
- Replaced.

1494
01:56:49,467 --> 01:56:51,094
By a better life...

1495
01:56:51,136 --> 01:56:52,887
under these...

1496
01:56:52,887 --> 01:56:55,557
beautiful, Monet-like skies.

1497
01:56:56,808 --> 01:56:58,268
My mother's favorite.

1498
01:56:59,144 --> 01:57:02,814
A better life
because you had Sofia.

1499
01:57:02,731 --> 01:57:07,152
You sculpted your Lucid Dream out
of the iconography of your youth.

1500
01:57:07,110 --> 01:57:09,779
An album cover
that once moved you.

1501
01:57:10,363 --> 01:57:11,531
An album cover?

1502
01:57:11,614 --> 01:57:12,907
There are some things...

1503
01:57:12,949 --> 01:57:15,952
that you're not old enough
to understand just yet.

1504
01:57:15,952 --> 01:57:20,373
A movie you saw once that showed you
what a father could be like...

1505
01:57:30,842 --> 01:57:33,345
or what love could be like.

1506
01:57:33,345 --> 01:57:34,929
This was a kind woman...

1507
01:57:34,971 --> 01:57:37,849
an individual...

1508
01:57:37,807 --> 01:57:40,143
more than your equal.

1509
01:57:40,185 --> 01:57:44,356
You barely knew her in real life,
but in your Lucid Dream...

1510
01:57:44,272 --> 01:57:46,274
she was your savior.

1511
01:57:50,654 --> 01:57:53,948
What happened in my real life?
Something happened.

1512
01:57:53,907 --> 01:57:55,367
What did you erase?

1513
01:57:55,408 --> 01:57:57,077
Do you really want to know?

1514
01:57:59,496 --> 01:58:01,122
Tell me everything.

1515
01:58:02,248 --> 01:58:05,251
The morning after the nightclub,
you woke up on that street...

1516
01:58:05,251 --> 01:58:07,128
hung over and alone.

1517
01:58:07,128 --> 01:58:08,838
You got up, walked away.

1518
01:58:10,006 --> 01:58:12,676
You never saw Sofia again.

1519
01:58:18,640 --> 01:58:20,725
I didn't kill Sofia.

1520
01:58:24,187 --> 01:58:25,522
You battled your board
for control of the company...

1521
01:58:25,438 --> 01:58:27,732
You battled your board
for control of the company...

1522
01:58:29,192 --> 01:58:32,153
and in the end it was Thomas Tipp,
your father's friend...

1523
01:58:32,153 --> 01:58:33,947
the man whose job you saved...

1524
01:58:33,989 --> 01:58:36,950
who wrenched the company
back into your control.

1525
01:58:37,909 --> 01:58:39,369
Tommy.

1526
01:58:40,912 --> 01:58:42,372
But then...

1527
01:58:43,540 --> 01:58:46,292
somebody died.

1528
01:58:48,461 --> 01:58:51,047
You longed for Sofia.

1529
01:58:51,006 --> 01:58:53,258
You shut yourself away for months.

1530
01:58:53,300 --> 01:58:54,926
You were alone.

1531
01:58:54,968 --> 01:58:58,680
You couldn't stand
the pain anymore, the headaches.

1532
01:58:58,638 --> 01:59:00,223
You could barely function.

1533
01:59:01,224 --> 01:59:03,476
I found you on the Internet.

1534
01:59:07,188 --> 01:59:09,899
I signed a contract with you,
and then--

1535
01:59:31,254 --> 01:59:32,672
I remember.

1536
01:59:42,307 --> 01:59:44,309
Somebody died.

1537
01:59:45,935 --> 01:59:47,520
It was me.

1538
01:59:54,653 --> 01:59:57,947
And on a day in late December...

1539
01:59:57,947 --> 02:00:00,033
you gave yourself to us.

1540
02:00:02,452 --> 02:00:05,038
You're now in a suspended state.

1541
02:00:09,125 --> 02:00:13,797
Your friend Brian Shelby threw a
three-day memorial in your old home.

1542
02:00:13,672 --> 02:00:15,674
He was a true friend.

1543
02:00:25,183 --> 02:00:27,310
You were missed, David.

1544
02:00:49,624 --> 02:00:52,293
It was Sofia
who never fully recovered.

1545
02:00:54,421 --> 02:00:57,465
It was she who somehow
knew you best...

1546
02:00:58,425 --> 02:01:01,469
and like you, she never
forgot that one night...

1547
02:01:01,428 --> 02:01:04,472
where true love seemed possible.

1548
02:01:13,064 --> 02:01:15,066
Consequences, David.

1549
02:01:32,000 --> 02:01:34,002
It's the little things.

1550
02:01:38,381 --> 02:01:40,342
The little things.

1551
02:01:41,801 --> 02:01:44,304
There's nothing bigger,
is there?

1552
02:01:53,104 --> 02:01:56,650
Your subconscious
did create problems.

1553
02:01:57,942 --> 02:02:00,278
Your dream
turned into a nightmare.

1554
02:02:01,321 --> 02:02:04,115
The glitch has been corrected.

1555
02:02:05,367 --> 02:02:08,078
So all I have to do
is imagine something.

1556
02:02:08,078 --> 02:02:10,038
Like, if I wanted...

1557
02:02:10,080 --> 02:02:12,165
McCabe to come back right now--

1558
02:02:16,086 --> 02:02:17,962
Listen to me.

1559
02:02:18,004 --> 02:02:19,756
These people are dangerous.

1560
02:02:20,965 --> 02:02:24,552
We're in trouble.
We need to get off this roof now.

1561
02:02:27,889 --> 02:02:29,849
We're now on pause...

1562
02:02:29,891 --> 02:02:32,477
and you're about to return
to your Lucid Dream.

1563
02:02:32,477 --> 02:02:34,354
With all the upgrades...

1564
02:02:34,396 --> 02:02:36,398
you won't remember any of this...

1565
02:02:36,398 --> 02:02:39,275
nor will you be charged
for technical support.

1566
02:02:39,275 --> 02:02:41,903
It's now your moment of choice.

1567
02:02:42,946 --> 02:02:46,574
You can return to your Lucid Dream
and live a beautiful life...

1568
02:02:46,533 --> 02:02:50,537
with Sofia or whomever you wish...

1569
02:02:50,453 --> 02:02:53,915
or you can choose
the world out there.

1570
02:02:55,834 --> 02:02:57,836
"The world out there."

1571
02:02:59,295 --> 02:03:01,297
And you can bring me back...

1572
02:03:01,297 --> 02:03:03,466
just like Benny the dog?

1573
02:03:03,466 --> 02:03:04,551
Yes.

1574
02:03:04,634 --> 02:03:08,138
Just like Benny the dog.

1575
02:03:08,972 --> 02:03:11,683
Your face and body
can be fixed now, of course.

1576
02:03:12,642 --> 02:03:16,187
But things
are very different now...

1577
02:03:16,146 --> 02:03:18,440
and your finances
won't last long.

1578
02:03:19,774 --> 02:03:23,111
Your panel of observers
are waiting for you to choose.

1579
02:03:27,866 --> 02:03:29,826
There are no guarantees...

1580
02:03:29,826 --> 02:03:31,161
but remember...

1581
02:03:31,244 --> 02:03:33,330
even in the future...

1582
02:03:33,371 --> 02:03:36,416
the sweet is never as sweet...

1583
02:03:36,416 --> 02:03:38,918
without the sour.

1584
02:03:56,728 --> 02:03:58,313
How do I wake up?

1585
02:03:58,855 --> 02:04:00,857
The decision is yours.

1586
02:04:05,695 --> 02:04:08,531
And I chose this scenario,
didn't I?

1587
02:04:09,908 --> 02:04:15,080
Yes, to face your last
remaining fear of heights.

1588
02:04:14,996 --> 02:04:16,998
David, don't listen to him.

1589
02:04:17,040 --> 02:04:20,085
You were right. This is
the seven dwarfs. It's a setup!

1590
02:04:20,043 --> 02:04:22,587
You can't trust him.

1591
02:04:22,545 --> 02:04:26,841
Don't feel bad for him, David.
This winning man is your creation.

1592
02:04:26,800 --> 02:04:30,845
It's in his nature to fight for
his existence, but he's not real.

1593
02:04:30,804 --> 02:04:32,263
I'm real.

1594
02:04:35,058 --> 02:04:36,351
I'm real.

1595
02:04:37,143 --> 02:04:39,229
I have two daughters...

1596
02:04:39,229 --> 02:04:40,814
and you know that.

1597
02:04:41,898 --> 02:04:43,525
What are their names?

1598
02:04:58,248 --> 02:04:59,708
I'm real.

1599
02:05:04,838 --> 02:05:08,049
I'm mortality
as home entertainment?

1600
02:05:08,049 --> 02:05:10,010
This cannot be the future!

1601
02:05:12,387 --> 02:05:13,471
Can it?

1602
02:05:15,557 --> 02:05:16,766
Can it?

1603
02:05:45,378 --> 02:05:47,172
Good-bye.

1604
02:05:50,133 --> 02:05:53,553
It's been a brilliant journey
of self-awakening.

1605
02:05:53,511 --> 02:05:57,015
And now you've simply got to
ask yourself this--

1606
02:05:56,973 --> 02:05:59,684
What is happiness to you, David?

1607
02:06:06,524 --> 02:06:09,027
I want to live a real life.

1608
02:06:10,070 --> 02:06:12,530
I don't want to dream any longer.

1609
02:06:13,531 --> 02:06:15,700
Any last wishes?

1610
02:06:18,203 --> 02:06:20,705
Let them out there
read my mind.

1611
02:06:22,374 --> 02:06:24,376
I wish you well, David.

1612
02:07:04,582 --> 02:07:07,002
Look at us.

1613
02:07:06,960 --> 02:07:08,962
I'm frozen, and you're dead.

1614
02:07:10,088 --> 02:07:11,673
And I love you.

1615
02:07:13,591 --> 02:07:15,051
It's a problem.

1616
02:07:18,972 --> 02:07:21,474
I lost you
when I got in that car.

1617
02:07:22,434 --> 02:07:24,060
I'm sorry.

1618
02:07:26,271 --> 02:07:29,357
Do you remember
what you told me once?

1619
02:07:30,066 --> 02:07:32,319
That every passing minute...

1620
02:07:33,528 --> 02:07:36,531
is another chance
to turn it all around.

1621
02:07:41,828 --> 02:07:43,830
I'll find you again.

1622
02:08:00,472 --> 02:08:03,141
I'll see you in another life...

1623
02:08:03,183 --> 02:08:05,518
when we are both cats.

1624
02:09:17,549 --> 02:09:19,592
Relax, David.

1625
02:09:19,592 --> 02:09:20,051
Open your eyes.

1626
02:09:20,051 --> 02:09:20,969
