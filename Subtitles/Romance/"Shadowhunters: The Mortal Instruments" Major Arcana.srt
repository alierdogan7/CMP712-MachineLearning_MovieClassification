Have you spoken

He can call me

We can't have that girl

The entire Shadow World

You do not get to talk

[Jace] Come again?
The tarot cards.

17

My mom, she must have
painted them years ago,

18
00:00:45,913 --> 00:00:49,253
but the Mortal Cup
has to be hidden
inside the Ace of Cups.

19

If Valentine started
creating Shadowhunters

of demons,

28

But he can control demons.
I've seen it.

Mmm, paying off
a few demons is easy,

32
00:01:16,243 --> 00:01:19,383

I went to the loft

everything out,

that you're gonna handle this.

who's working for Valentine.

If anybody spots you--

We'd be leading them
right to the Mortal Cup.

175
00:08:58,705 --> 00:09:01,665
Exactly. Better to assume
that everybody has the Sight

176
00:09:01,675 --> 00:09:03,505
than gamble that they don't.

00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:07,949
Hey, what happened
to the camera?

179
00:09:11,218 --> 00:09:13,788
I've asked
the same thing for years.

180
00:09:21,562 --> 00:09:23,062
Slept at Magnus' place?

181
00:09:23,063 --> 00:09:24,433
Didn't do much sleeping.

182
00:09:24,431 --> 00:09:26,931
I was helping
treat Luke's wounds.
That's all.

183
00:09:26,934 --> 00:09:28,004
Really?

184
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:30,740
What?

185
00:09:32,406 --> 00:09:34,966
[sighs] Nothing.
I believe you.

186
00:09:37,244 --> 00:09:41,284
Okay, Magnus made cocktails.
I'm telling you,
nothing else happened.

187
00:09:41,281 --> 00:09:42,411
When you're
ready to talk about

188
00:09:42,416 --> 00:09:44,016
whatever you
need to talk about,

189
00:09:44,017 --> 00:09:45,077
I'm here.

190
00:09:45,085 --> 00:09:46,785
Hey, I talk to you.

191
00:09:46,787 --> 00:09:48,747
About everything
but your personal life.

192
00:09:48,755 --> 00:09:49,955
You know, and it's
kind of not fair,

193
00:09:49,957 --> 00:09:52,857
because I talk
to you about mine
all the time.

194
00:09:52,859 --> 00:09:55,289
For example,
I broke up with Meliorn.

195
00:09:55,295 --> 00:09:57,855
Really?
Turning over a new leaf?

196
00:09:57,864 --> 00:10:00,904
[scoffs] He was a bit much.

197
00:10:00,901 --> 00:10:03,601
Apparently, I need someone
more Shadowhunter-ish.

198
00:10:03,604 --> 00:10:05,404
Izzy, I realize
that you're trying

199
00:10:05,405 --> 00:10:07,105
to take some of
the family heat,

200
00:10:07,107 --> 00:10:09,137
and I appreciate it,

201
00:10:09,142 --> 00:10:10,812
but you can't
change who you are.

202
00:10:10,811 --> 00:10:11,881
Really?

203
00:10:12,546 --> 00:10:14,646
And you can?
I know who I am.

204
00:10:14,648 --> 00:10:16,248
I'm a guy who's
about to be disowned

205
00:10:16,249 --> 00:10:17,919
when Dad finds out
that Jace and Clary

206
00:10:17,918 --> 00:10:19,548
are still out
doing God knows what.

207
00:10:19,553 --> 00:10:21,553
I think Dad's
used to that by now.

208
00:10:21,555 --> 00:10:23,145
This is Jace
you're talking about.

209
00:10:23,156 --> 00:10:25,386
He said he'd be an hour.
It's been three.

210
00:10:25,392 --> 00:10:27,832
You don't think
he and Clary are...

211
00:10:27,828 --> 00:10:30,698
At a time like this?
Not possible.

212
00:10:32,466 --> 00:10:33,826
[Jace] <i> Really? In here?</i>

213
00:10:33,834 --> 00:10:36,604
[Clary] Why not?
[Jace] There's got
to be a better place.

214
00:10:36,603 --> 00:10:38,673
[Clary] No, here's good.
[Jace] Ow!

215
00:10:38,672 --> 00:10:40,642
[Jace] All right.
[clattering]

216
00:10:45,746 --> 00:10:47,346
[energy pulsating]

217
00:10:47,347 --> 00:10:48,577
You need help with that?

218
00:10:48,582 --> 00:10:50,652
[Clary] I can
deglamourize myself, Jace.

219
00:10:50,651 --> 00:10:52,151
[clattering]
[energy pulsating]

220
00:10:52,152 --> 00:10:54,322
It's "deglamour."
[Clary] Whatever.

221
00:10:56,256 --> 00:10:57,716
The cards?
Right.

222
00:10:58,759 --> 00:11:00,989
How exactly are
we gonna get them?

223
00:11:00,994 --> 00:11:03,534
I doubt we can make
it out of this closet
without drawing attention,

224
00:11:03,530 --> 00:11:07,100
let alone Luke's desk
and you are covered in runes.

225
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:08,600
Don't worry.
I've got a plan.

226
00:11:08,602 --> 00:11:11,172
A good plan this time?
90%.

227
00:11:11,171 --> 00:11:12,841
Just follow my lead.

228
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:14,469
Oh, and I apologize.

229
00:11:14,474 --> 00:11:15,974
Apologize for what?

230
00:11:15,976 --> 00:11:17,506
The other 10%.

231
00:11:22,983 --> 00:11:25,523
[sighs] You son of a bitch!

232
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:26,749
Oh!

233
00:11:30,557 --> 00:11:32,187
Stop following me!

234
00:11:32,191 --> 00:11:33,821
[whispering] Hey,
what happened to
being discreet?

235
00:11:33,827 --> 00:11:35,657
Hmm?
Wait, what did you say?

236
00:11:35,662 --> 00:11:37,862
You cheated on me?
I... Huh?

237
00:11:39,032 --> 00:11:40,402
I did not. Whoa.

238
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:42,930
You will never see me
at your crappy
apartment again.

239
00:11:44,137 --> 00:11:46,497
That girl means nothing
to me. Nothing.
[Clary sighs]

240
00:11:46,506 --> 00:11:48,636
Is that the boyfriend
that I heard so much about?

241
00:11:48,642 --> 00:11:49,872
[Clary] Nope, not anymore.
Hi.

242
00:11:49,876 --> 00:11:51,176
I'm dumping him.

243
00:11:51,178 --> 00:11:52,878
Where is all of
Luke's stuff?

244
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:55,049
IA took everything.
What are you looking for?

245
00:11:55,849 --> 00:11:57,849
I, uh... [stutters]
I lost a house key

246
00:11:57,851 --> 00:11:59,551
and Luke normally keeps
a spare in his desk,

247
00:11:59,553 --> 00:12:01,723
so is there any
way I can get it?

248
00:12:01,722 --> 00:12:03,052
Uh, not till he's cleared.

249
00:12:03,857 --> 00:12:06,057
Cleared?
Of... of what?

250
00:12:06,059 --> 00:12:08,729
Oh, don't worry about it.
We'll get it handled.

251
00:12:08,729 --> 00:12:09,889
Oh.

252
00:12:09,896 --> 00:12:11,996
[Jace] Clary, I'm sorry.

253
00:12:11,998 --> 00:12:14,098
I apologize.
I just want you to know
it only happened, like...

254
00:12:14,101 --> 00:12:15,701
two or...
It just happened
a couple of times

255
00:12:15,702 --> 00:12:17,572
and I am totally--
[both] Shut up.

256
00:12:17,571 --> 00:12:18,941
Babe, come on.

257
00:12:18,939 --> 00:12:21,409
Listen, you don't get
to call her "babe," okay?

258
00:12:21,408 --> 00:12:22,608
In fact, you don't
get to call her at all.

259
00:12:22,609 --> 00:12:24,779
Clary's done with you.
You got it?

260
00:12:24,778 --> 00:12:26,908
Take him out.
[Jace] I have rights.

261
00:12:27,748 --> 00:12:29,008
Perhaps it's for the best?

262
00:12:29,015 --> 00:12:30,245
[sighs]

263
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:34,250
Oh, matching tattoos.
That's... Big red flag.

264
00:12:34,254 --> 00:12:36,924
Oh. [chuckles] This...
[stutters] It's nothing.

265
00:12:36,923 --> 00:12:38,463
Don't worry about it.
I get it.

266
00:12:38,458 --> 00:12:39,818
You always fall for
the bad boys, right?

267
00:12:41,394 --> 00:12:43,634
Oh, is that just me?

268
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:45,700
Uh, right, right.
[chuckles] Uh...

269
00:12:46,566 --> 00:12:47,926
I really need that key.

270
00:12:47,934 --> 00:12:50,744
I'm sorry, Clary, but IA
has all of Luke's things

271
00:12:50,737 --> 00:12:52,767
in the evidence
vault upstairs.

272
00:12:52,773 --> 00:12:54,113
Oh.

273
00:12:54,107 --> 00:12:56,007
Maybe I can help you
find the one you lost.

274
00:12:56,777 --> 00:12:58,037
Did you check your bag?

275
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:01,210
Oh, my God!

276
00:13:01,214 --> 00:13:02,884
You're totally right.

277
00:13:02,883 --> 00:13:05,183
Thank you so much.
[chuckles]

278
00:13:06,286 --> 00:13:07,546
Bye.

279
00:13:07,554 --> 00:13:11,564
I'm going to lunch.
This job is gonna
be the death of me.

280
00:13:45,258 --> 00:13:46,318
French press.

281
00:13:49,095 --> 00:13:50,625
And a garlic bagel.

282
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:52,000
Extra garlic.

283
00:13:53,633 --> 00:13:56,633
Oh, uh... um...

284
00:13:56,636 --> 00:14:00,666
I'm doing research
for a graphic novel
I'm writing about vampires.

285
00:14:00,674 --> 00:14:03,584
I don't think I'm
actually becoming one,
'cause that would be crazy.

286
00:14:04,544 --> 00:14:07,014
Where's what's-her-face?
Latte-and-no-whip-cream girl?

287
00:14:07,013 --> 00:14:08,613
Clary, uh...

288
00:14:09,983 --> 00:14:12,583
I don't know.
She's not...
answering my texts.

289
00:14:13,186 --> 00:14:15,286
Can't imagine why.
[chuckles]

290
00:14:17,824 --> 00:14:18,894
You all right?

291
00:14:20,227 --> 00:14:23,357
Yeah, it's just, uh...
[sighs] Just think
I need some caffeine.

292
00:14:23,363 --> 00:14:25,003
Okay.

293
00:14:24,998 --> 00:14:27,598
You might want to
let that brew...
Never mind.

294
00:14:41,581 --> 00:14:43,151
[exhales] Okay.

295
00:14:46,052 --> 00:14:47,452
[sighs]

296
00:15:07,173 --> 00:15:08,243
Not again.

297
00:15:11,044 --> 00:15:12,514
[bubbling]

298
00:15:23,423 --> 00:15:24,493
[sighs]

299
00:15:26,293 --> 00:15:27,363
[sniffs]

300
00:15:33,934 --> 00:15:35,134
Can I do something
for you?

301
00:15:35,135 --> 00:15:36,595
I need a list of
everything seized

302
00:15:36,603 --> 00:15:38,043
from Detective
Garroway's desk.

303
00:15:38,038 --> 00:15:39,498
And I need
a slice of pizza.

304
00:15:40,874 --> 00:15:44,614
The list. Now.
Full inventory.

305
00:15:45,245 --> 00:15:46,805
Bring it up
with my office.

306
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:52,380
I'm sorry I couldn't be
more helpful, but, uh, I...

307
00:15:52,385 --> 00:15:54,545
I'm hungry.
[dog barking]

308
00:15:55,488 --> 00:15:57,218
Apparently,
I'm not the only one.

309
00:15:58,091 --> 00:15:59,291
[dog growling]

310
00:15:59,292 --> 00:16:01,762
She must smell a rat.
An IA rat.

311
00:16:01,761 --> 00:16:03,161
[scoffs]

312
00:16:04,798 --> 00:16:06,528
[barking]

313
00:16:11,438 --> 00:16:13,808
You know what?
I'm gonna bring Alec
with me next time.

314
00:16:13,807 --> 00:16:15,007
I don't think he's ever
slapped me in the face.

315
00:16:15,008 --> 00:16:16,638
[sighs] I'm sorry,
I panicked.

316
00:16:16,643 --> 00:16:18,943
Someone call for backup?
Yeah. What took
you guys so long?

317
00:16:18,945 --> 00:16:20,445
Funny, I was gonna ask
you the same thing.

318
00:16:20,447 --> 00:16:21,577
It's complicated.

319
00:16:22,315 --> 00:16:24,645
We found the Cup.
The Cup?

320
00:16:24,651 --> 00:16:26,481
Yeah, but then we lost it.

321
00:16:26,486 --> 00:16:27,986
We have to sneak back
in the precinct to get it.

322
00:16:27,988 --> 00:16:29,918
This is a disaster.

323
00:16:29,923 --> 00:16:32,323
Hey, demon pox is a disaster.
This is an inconvenience.

324
00:16:32,325 --> 00:16:33,655
We just need a plan.
That's all.

325
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:35,830
What about a glamour?
We tried that.

326
00:16:35,829 --> 00:16:38,299
Anyone working with Valentine
will see right through it.

327
00:16:38,298 --> 00:16:39,958
Can we ask Magnus Bane
to portal us inside?

328
00:16:39,966 --> 00:16:42,066
No.
That'd be awkward.

329
00:16:42,836 --> 00:16:43,896
[gasps]

330
00:16:45,005 --> 00:16:47,365
Magnus can only portal us
to places he's been to before.

331
00:16:47,374 --> 00:16:48,944
[cell phone ringing]

332
00:16:49,976 --> 00:16:52,676
Not again.
Just give me a second.

333
00:16:52,679 --> 00:16:54,479
Simon, this is
really not a good time.

334
00:16:54,481 --> 00:16:56,651
Clary, where are you?
This is an emergency.

335
00:16:56,649 --> 00:16:58,319
Simon, are you okay?

336
00:16:58,318 --> 00:17:00,178
I'm not sure.
I haven't been
kidnapped yet today.

337
00:17:00,186 --> 00:17:01,586
Simon, seriously,
what's going on?

338
00:17:03,323 --> 00:17:05,093
I think I'm sick.
Like, really sick.

339
00:17:06,459 --> 00:17:08,689
Simon, remember that time
you thought you
had the bird flu?

340
00:17:08,695 --> 00:17:10,185
Okay, just stay
off the Internet
and you'll be fine.

341
00:17:10,196 --> 00:17:11,926
[stutters] Yeah, I know.
But this time it's different.

342
00:17:12,532 --> 00:17:14,102
Hey--
This time I'm really--

343
00:17:15,301 --> 00:17:16,831
Oh, my God.
She hung up on me.

344
00:17:16,836 --> 00:17:18,796
Simon's little
problem can wait.
I've got a great plan.

345
00:17:18,805 --> 00:17:20,165
Oh, there's a first.

346
00:17:20,173 --> 00:17:23,043
[laughs sarcastically]
Just follow my lead.

347
00:17:23,043 --> 00:17:25,483
Oh, and don't worry,
in my plan,
no one gets slapped.

348
00:17:28,248 --> 00:17:30,178
Thanks, Jerry.
I appreciate it.

349
00:17:30,183 --> 00:17:31,253
We're done for today.

350
00:17:31,251 --> 00:17:33,751
But don't go too far.
You'll be hearing from me.

351
00:17:33,753 --> 00:17:35,253
I wouldn't dream of it.

352
00:17:36,589 --> 00:17:40,289
Listen, Garroway, do you
think I'm trying to be
a pain in your ass?

353
00:17:41,061 --> 00:17:42,461
Well, the thought
had occurred to me.

354
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:48,100
Dude, we've got
your car wrapped
around a street light,

355
00:17:48,101 --> 00:17:49,831
drenched in blood,
carrying a GPS

356
00:17:49,836 --> 00:17:51,436
that puts you at
the scene of the crime.

357
00:17:51,438 --> 00:17:54,468
I'm not a bad guy.
I'm just not stupid.

358
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,080
[knocks on door]

359
00:18:14,527 --> 00:18:15,687
[sniffs]

360
00:18:32,612 --> 00:18:33,852
[groans]

361
00:18:52,398 --> 00:18:53,968
Vargas was a good cop.

362
00:18:54,734 --> 00:18:56,134
She was my friend.

363
00:18:57,737 --> 00:18:59,137
One of the few.

364
00:18:59,139 --> 00:19:02,409
Your friends
seem to have a habit
of turning up dead.

365
00:19:02,408 --> 00:19:05,238
I can't even imagine
what your
Facebook page looks like.

366
00:19:05,245 --> 00:19:06,205
You think I killed her?

367
00:19:07,147 --> 00:19:08,977
[inhales] No.

368
00:19:09,816 --> 00:19:11,746
In fact,
I think I'm your alibi.

369
00:19:11,751 --> 00:19:13,551
Well, I'd appreciate that.

370
00:19:14,854 --> 00:19:16,554
Don't thank me just yet.

371
00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:19,390
I still haven't
figured out your deal.

372
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:23,660
Even a blind guy can tell
something weird is going on.

373
00:19:23,663 --> 00:19:24,933
You want to do
right by Vargas?

374
00:19:25,832 --> 00:19:26,902
Help me out here.

375
00:19:28,668 --> 00:19:30,228
You wouldn't
believe me
if I told you.

376
00:19:31,004 --> 00:19:32,074
Try me.

377
00:19:32,505 --> 00:19:33,835
[Alaric] Fisk.

378
00:19:35,842 --> 00:19:37,242
Think about it.

379
00:19:42,015 --> 00:19:43,545
[Fisk] Yeah.

380
00:19:43,550 --> 00:19:46,320
[Alaric] I checked her wrist.
There's no defensive wounds.

381
00:19:46,319 --> 00:19:47,719
[Fisk] Another demonic murder?

382
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:49,820
[Alaric]
I don't think so.
Similar MO,

383
00:19:49,822 --> 00:19:52,222
but she wasn't
drained of blood.

384
00:19:52,225 --> 00:19:53,885
The ME have
a time of death?

385
00:19:53,893 --> 00:19:55,233
[Alaric] We're
waiting on forensics,

386
00:19:55,228 --> 00:19:57,628
but early guess
is she's been dead
a couple of hours.

387
00:19:57,630 --> 00:19:59,060
[Fisk] A couple hours?

388
00:19:59,065 --> 00:20:02,295
No way. I just
talked to the captain
45 minutes ago.

389
00:20:02,302 --> 00:20:04,142
You guys are killing me.

390
00:20:10,643 --> 00:20:12,813
Check the body
for venom.

391
00:20:12,811 --> 00:20:14,981
If it's a demon,
I need to know exactly
what I'm looking for.

392
00:20:14,981 --> 00:20:16,051
Okay.

393
00:20:26,392 --> 00:20:27,462
[knock on door]

394
00:20:30,063 --> 00:20:31,333
Simon...

395
00:20:32,265 --> 00:20:33,395
can we have a talk?

396
00:20:34,067 --> 00:20:35,597
"We"?

397
00:20:35,602 --> 00:20:37,302
You, me and your sister.

398
00:20:39,405 --> 00:20:41,185
Do I have a choice?

399
00:20:41,190 --> 00:20:42,970
Well, I've already ducked out
of the office early, so...

400
00:20:43,776 --> 00:20:44,836
no.

401
00:20:45,778 --> 00:20:46,978
Okay.

402
00:20:48,114 --> 00:20:49,914
[sighs]

403
00:20:49,916 --> 00:20:52,316
I stayed out last
night at Maureen's. I...

404
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:55,319
I should have called.
[stutters] It slipped my mind.

405
00:20:56,256 --> 00:20:58,186
So, what are you gonna do?
Ground me?

406
00:20:58,958 --> 00:21:03,088
Maureen called us
this morning and
she was very upset.

407
00:21:03,096 --> 00:21:04,796
Actually,
Maureen called me...

408
00:21:05,698 --> 00:21:09,068
and she said that
you were spazzing out,
like more than normal.

409
00:21:09,068 --> 00:21:10,528
She said...
She did what?

410
00:21:10,536 --> 00:21:13,096
Well, I just tried
to say that's kind of
how you are with girls,

411
00:21:13,106 --> 00:21:15,836
but, uh, she was
very upset, so...

412
00:21:17,377 --> 00:21:19,777
I told Mom.
You did what?

413
00:21:20,613 --> 00:21:23,953
Simon, Maureen thinks that...
that you might be on drugs.

414
00:21:25,218 --> 00:21:26,778
[stammering]

415
00:21:26,786 --> 00:21:28,586
And listen,
if I thought it
was just marijuana

416
00:21:28,588 --> 00:21:30,518
I wouldn't be so worried,
but, honey...

417
00:21:31,424 --> 00:21:32,624
you look like you're dying.

418
00:21:32,625 --> 00:21:34,785
[scoffs] Would dying get me
out of this conversation?

419
00:21:34,794 --> 00:21:37,834
I know that I'm not
usually the sentimental
one here, but...

420
00:21:39,766 --> 00:21:41,896
we're here for you.
[Elaine] It's all right.

421
00:21:41,901 --> 00:21:44,641
You can tell us,
whatever it is.

422
00:21:46,572 --> 00:21:48,712
Okay, okay, um...

423
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:56,610
I think I have a disease.

424
00:21:56,616 --> 00:21:58,776
[Elaine] A disease?
Like, a bad one.

425
00:21:58,785 --> 00:22:00,645
[gasps] Do you have an STD?

426
00:22:00,653 --> 00:22:02,493
Okay, let's let him
finish talking.

427
00:22:02,488 --> 00:22:04,258
Look, Simon,
it's really not as
bad as you think.

428
00:22:04,257 --> 00:22:05,287
These things happen,
all right?

429
00:22:05,291 --> 00:22:06,821
When I was in law school,
I experimented--

430
00:22:06,826 --> 00:22:09,656
We're really off track here.
I think we really
need to focus on Simon.

431
00:22:09,662 --> 00:22:11,162
[Elaine] Rebecca,
it's 2016, all right?

432
00:22:11,164 --> 00:22:12,604
Mom, I'm more than happy--
I had a life.

433
00:22:12,598 --> 00:22:14,868
Hey, hey, guys...
[both arguing]

434
00:22:14,867 --> 00:22:16,927
I'm still right here.
[Rebecca] Do not
make this about you.

435
00:22:16,936 --> 00:22:18,366
I'm still right here.

436
00:22:18,371 --> 00:22:19,671
[arguing continues]

437
00:22:20,606 --> 00:22:21,936
Excuse me?

438
00:22:21,941 --> 00:22:23,211
[arguing continues]

439
00:22:23,209 --> 00:22:24,509
Shut up!

440
00:22:35,722 --> 00:22:36,792
Simon?

441
00:22:42,895 --> 00:22:45,125
So, I was promised
a great plan.

442
00:22:45,131 --> 00:22:47,231
We'll head up
towards the vault.

443
00:22:47,233 --> 00:22:49,503
Alec and Izzy are
handling the rest.

444
00:22:49,502 --> 00:22:51,172
All we have to do
is wait for their signal...

445
00:22:51,170 --> 00:22:52,800
[sighs]
...and grab the Cup.

446
00:23:04,250 --> 00:23:05,550
He's on our side.

447
00:23:05,551 --> 00:23:06,721
You sure?

448
00:23:06,719 --> 00:23:09,049
Isn't that the line he used
when he kidnapped you?

449
00:23:09,055 --> 00:23:10,115
Good point.

450
00:23:15,561 --> 00:23:17,901
What now? We're supposed
to climb the elevator shaft

451
00:23:17,897 --> 00:23:19,557
and waltz in
the vault unnoticed?

452
00:23:21,567 --> 00:23:23,227
Now, why didn't
I think of that?

453
00:23:23,236 --> 00:23:24,566
[laughs]

454
00:23:26,539 --> 00:23:27,809
Wait, you're kidding, right?

455
00:23:28,908 --> 00:23:31,638
Remember the binoculars?
Yeah.

456
00:23:32,412 --> 00:23:36,052
This one's a Nyx rune.
It's like night vision.

457
00:23:36,048 --> 00:23:37,248
You can copy mine.

458
00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:39,020
You got it?
Yeah.

459
00:23:39,752 --> 00:23:40,892
Why do I need night vision?

460
00:23:40,887 --> 00:23:41,987
You'll see.

461
00:23:44,357 --> 00:23:45,857
[sighs]

462
00:23:45,858 --> 00:23:47,658
[inhales deeply]

463
00:23:49,228 --> 00:23:50,488
[winces]

464
00:23:51,731 --> 00:23:52,801
Um...

465
00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:54,929
Feel free to ask for help.

466
00:23:59,806 --> 00:24:01,166
[flesh searing]

467
00:24:02,208 --> 00:24:04,938
I, um... I think I can
take it from here.

468
00:24:05,745 --> 00:24:07,875
Where's the fun in that?

469
00:24:11,584 --> 00:24:13,154
[Alec] Okay, I'm guessing
you're the distraction?

470
00:24:13,152 --> 00:24:14,222
Nope.

471
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:16,450
I've decided to
grow up, remember?

472
00:24:16,456 --> 00:24:18,116
No more distracting for me.

473
00:24:18,958 --> 00:24:22,288
Besides, I don't think
I'm her type.

474
00:24:22,295 --> 00:24:23,825
Oh, crap.

475
00:24:23,830 --> 00:24:26,560
Don't worry,
it's good practice.
Huh?

476
00:24:26,566 --> 00:24:28,696
You know,
for asking out Magnus.

477
00:24:29,635 --> 00:24:30,865
[chuckles]

478
00:24:31,771 --> 00:24:32,971
What are you...
what are you doing?

479
00:24:32,972 --> 00:24:35,242
Unbuttoning your shirt.
What's it look like I'm doing?

480
00:24:35,241 --> 00:24:37,241
Izzy, this is not
really my department.
[sighs] Come on.

481
00:24:37,243 --> 00:24:38,513
You do this sort of
stuff all the time.

482
00:24:38,511 --> 00:24:40,681
You do, I don't.
It's easy.

483
00:24:43,516 --> 00:24:44,646
Come on.

484
00:24:48,154 --> 00:24:49,224
Hey.

485
00:24:50,089 --> 00:24:51,259
Can I help you?

486
00:24:51,257 --> 00:24:53,017
Yeah, um...

487
00:24:53,025 --> 00:24:54,325
[stutters] You
come here often?

488
00:24:55,261 --> 00:24:57,091
I work here.
What can I help you with?

489
00:24:57,096 --> 00:24:58,626
Right, um...

490
00:24:58,631 --> 00:25:00,401
Right, right, right,
yeah, um...

491
00:25:00,399 --> 00:25:02,169
Yeah, I'm just...
I'm looking for
some information.

492
00:25:02,835 --> 00:25:04,795
Oh, look...
Oh, wow.

493
00:25:04,804 --> 00:25:05,974
I'm so sorry.

494
00:25:05,972 --> 00:25:07,202
Let me just get that.

495
00:25:07,874 --> 00:25:09,474
That's not... I'm so sorry.

496
00:25:09,475 --> 00:25:12,175
That's such a mess.
Let me clean that up.

497
00:25:12,178 --> 00:25:13,508
Uh, it's not working. Okay.
Here, let me.

498
00:25:13,513 --> 00:25:15,353
No, I got it.
I got it. Just go. Go.

499
00:25:15,348 --> 00:25:16,508
You sure?
Go.

500
00:25:16,516 --> 00:25:17,916
Thank you so much.

501
00:25:33,032 --> 00:25:34,432
[sizzling]

502
00:25:40,206 --> 00:25:41,466
[groans]

503
00:25:42,408 --> 00:25:44,208
I think you
messed something up.

504
00:25:44,210 --> 00:25:46,010
Really?

505
00:25:46,012 --> 00:25:47,342
No, I didn't.

506
00:25:47,346 --> 00:25:48,646
Then why
isn't it working?

507
00:25:48,648 --> 00:25:49,878
It is.

508
00:25:49,882 --> 00:25:52,252
[alarm blaring]
That's the signal.

509
00:25:53,886 --> 00:25:54,986
Whoa.

510
00:25:54,987 --> 00:25:56,447
Right?

511
00:25:59,692 --> 00:26:01,292
Going up.

512
00:26:04,730 --> 00:26:06,730
[alarm continues]
[Luke] What's going on?

513
00:26:06,732 --> 00:26:09,172
Some sort of power surge.
Whole building's fried.

514
00:26:09,168 --> 00:26:10,898
No lights,
no camera, no nothing.

515
00:26:10,903 --> 00:26:12,073
Get anything
on our killer?

516
00:26:12,071 --> 00:26:13,201
Yeah, you were right.

517
00:26:13,205 --> 00:26:15,405
Huge amounts
of demon venom
in Vargas' blood.

518
00:26:15,408 --> 00:26:17,168
It's a shapeshifter.
All right.

519
00:26:17,176 --> 00:26:19,176
I'm going after it.
Alert the pack.

520
00:26:19,178 --> 00:26:20,778
Anyone sees Vargas,
kill her.

521
00:26:20,780 --> 00:26:22,680
You were trapped in
the precinct all day.

522
00:26:22,682 --> 00:26:25,022
If that demon wanted you dead,
it certainly had
the opportunity.

523
00:26:25,017 --> 00:26:26,677
It's not after me.
It's after Clary.

524
00:26:26,686 --> 00:26:28,086
Otherwise, I wouldn't be
asking for your help.

525
00:26:28,087 --> 00:26:30,517
You're pack leader now.
You don't need to ask.

526
00:26:30,523 --> 00:26:31,923
Thanks, bud.

527
00:26:41,734 --> 00:26:43,134
What is all this crap?

528
00:26:44,136 --> 00:26:45,536
Lunch receipts?

529
00:27:11,097 --> 00:27:12,197
[Clary exhales]

530
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:16,300
[softly] You're
getting pretty good
with your stele.

531
00:27:16,302 --> 00:27:18,142
Well, at least we know
he's not a Downworlder.

532
00:27:18,137 --> 00:27:19,397
Lucky for us.

533
00:27:19,405 --> 00:27:21,865
Give me a heads up
next time
you're gonna do that.

534
00:27:33,119 --> 00:27:34,179
In here.

535
00:27:54,373 --> 00:27:56,013
This will take all day.

536
00:27:57,109 --> 00:27:58,179
[sighs]

537
00:28:03,816 --> 00:28:05,916
Or you could just do that.

538
00:28:18,964 --> 00:28:21,534
That looks exactly
like the Mortal Cup.

539
00:28:21,534 --> 00:28:23,974
This is it.
It has to be.

540
00:28:33,045 --> 00:28:34,275
What's wrong?

541
00:28:35,214 --> 00:28:36,454
[stutters]
I'm not sure. I...

542
00:28:37,983 --> 00:28:39,223
You're not sure
what's wrong

543
00:28:39,218 --> 00:28:41,448
or you're not sure
where your mom hid the Cup?

544
00:28:46,358 --> 00:28:47,458
[sighs]

545
00:28:53,432 --> 00:28:55,432
Did you get it?
Theoretically.

546
00:28:55,434 --> 00:28:57,234
Theoretically?
Yeah. [sighs]

547
00:28:57,236 --> 00:28:58,736
I found the card.
I just have to figure out

548
00:28:58,738 --> 00:29:00,738
how I reached into
my notebook before.
It's...

549
00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:02,710
It's not an exact science.
Can't you just
pull the Cup out?

550
00:29:02,708 --> 00:29:04,578
I can, theoretically.
I just...

551
00:29:04,577 --> 00:29:05,937
It's not as easy
as it looks, Alec.

552
00:29:05,945 --> 00:29:07,505
Listen, you two can
discuss theories

553
00:29:07,513 --> 00:29:09,083
as much as you want
when we get back
to the Institute.

554
00:29:09,081 --> 00:29:10,911
But right now,
considering we just stole

555
00:29:10,916 --> 00:29:12,176
from the cops,
I suggest we get home.

556
00:29:12,184 --> 00:29:13,754
Guys...
[necklace pulsing]

557
00:29:13,753 --> 00:29:16,593
I think the mundanes
might be
the least of our worries.

558
00:29:16,589 --> 00:29:17,789
Well, at least we know
the demon necklace works.

559
00:29:17,790 --> 00:29:19,990
Never a dull day. Let's go.

560
00:29:22,094 --> 00:29:23,664
Guys, slow down.

561
00:29:27,733 --> 00:29:29,973
[gasps] Oh, I am so sorry.

562
00:29:30,936 --> 00:29:31,936
[roars]

563
00:29:34,273 --> 00:29:35,443
[growling]

564
00:29:35,441 --> 00:29:36,541
Grandma.

565
00:29:37,743 --> 00:29:38,983
[grunts]
[demon screeches]

566
00:29:40,279 --> 00:29:41,649
What the hell?

567
00:29:42,882 --> 00:29:45,082
Language.
Not in front of Grandma.

568
00:29:45,084 --> 00:29:46,984
How did it find us?

569
00:29:48,654 --> 00:29:49,994
[Jace] I don't know...

570
00:29:49,989 --> 00:29:52,559
but she brought friends.
How can you tell?

571
00:29:52,558 --> 00:29:53,958
It's like seeing
through a glamour.

572
00:29:53,959 --> 00:29:56,289
You just got to
pay attention
to the details.

573
00:29:56,295 --> 00:29:57,555
But I can't see anything.

574
00:29:57,563 --> 00:29:58,633
Behind us.

575
00:30:01,433 --> 00:30:03,073
I... I still can't see them.

576
00:30:06,739 --> 00:30:08,269
Okay, there's
too many people.

577
00:30:08,274 --> 00:30:10,814
I don't say this often,
but I agree with Clary.

578
00:30:10,810 --> 00:30:12,680
We gotta get out of here.
Hey, this way!

579
00:30:21,153 --> 00:30:24,023
[panting] What's
the Unlock rune again?

580
00:30:26,492 --> 00:30:28,062
Open sesame.

581
00:30:29,829 --> 00:30:30,889
[Jace] Go.

582
00:30:37,837 --> 00:30:39,867
Hey, what are you doing?

583
00:30:39,872 --> 00:30:42,442
Holding them off.
Take Clary back
to the Institute.

584
00:30:42,441 --> 00:30:44,541
No, if you're staying,
I'm staying.
We fight together.

585
00:30:44,543 --> 00:30:47,613
Don't be stupid.
If the demons get the Cup,
we're dead anyways.

586
00:30:47,613 --> 00:30:50,113
I'm not leaving
anyone behind.
You don't have a choice.

587
00:30:50,115 --> 00:30:52,715
I know you guys are
having a moment, okay?
But we really have to go.

588
00:30:52,718 --> 00:30:54,688
[Isabelle] Don't worry.
It's not like this
is the first time

589
00:30:54,687 --> 00:30:56,717
Alec has saved your life.
[sighs]

590
00:30:56,722 --> 00:30:58,062
I doubt it'd be the last.

591
00:30:58,057 --> 00:30:59,417
Go.

592
00:31:08,834 --> 00:31:10,534
[dialing]

593
00:31:10,536 --> 00:31:12,196
[line ringing]

594
00:31:12,204 --> 00:31:13,344
[Clary] <i> Hello.</i>
Clary?

595
00:31:13,339 --> 00:31:15,539
I need you--
<i>You've reached Clary's phone.</i>

596
00:31:15,541 --> 00:31:17,341
<i> I'm not here,</i>
<i> but you know the deal.</i>

597
00:31:17,343 --> 00:31:19,013
<i> Leave one at the beep.</i>
[line beeps]

598
00:31:19,011 --> 00:31:20,481
Um, Clary...

599
00:31:20,479 --> 00:31:22,279
[shuddering] I
need to talk to you.

600
00:31:23,315 --> 00:31:24,505
I think I need to
talk to you more

601
00:31:24,516 --> 00:31:26,616
than I've ever needed
to talk to you in my life.

602
00:31:27,553 --> 00:31:29,853
I know... [inhales deeply]

603
00:31:29,855 --> 00:31:32,115
I know you're busy
saving your mom, but...

604
00:31:34,393 --> 00:31:36,633
I think I'm
becoming a vampire.

605
00:31:37,997 --> 00:31:39,157
[phone beeps]

606
00:31:39,164 --> 00:31:41,474
Darling, you don't
know the half of it.

607
00:31:44,503 --> 00:31:46,443
Blood is stronger than will.

608
00:31:46,438 --> 00:31:48,568
[shuddering] Shut up.

609
00:31:48,574 --> 00:31:51,584
Stronger than desire.

610
00:31:51,577 --> 00:31:53,537
Shut up! [grunts]

611
00:31:53,545 --> 00:31:56,305
[Camille echoing]
<i> Even stronger than love.</i>

612
00:31:59,184 --> 00:32:01,294
[breathing heavily]

613
00:32:10,229 --> 00:32:11,629
[gasps]

614
00:32:14,033 --> 00:32:16,473
[shuddering]

615
00:32:16,468 --> 00:32:17,868
Come to me.

616
00:32:19,371 --> 00:32:21,511
What you really want is--
[yells]

617
00:32:23,309 --> 00:32:25,179
[gasping]

618
00:32:31,817 --> 00:32:33,147
[sobbing]

619
00:32:44,229 --> 00:32:45,299
[panting] Hold on.

620
00:32:45,297 --> 00:32:48,797
I'm sorry, Jace.
It's okay.
We can take a breather.

621
00:32:48,801 --> 00:32:50,531
[Clary] No, it's not that.
I, um...

622
00:32:52,504 --> 00:32:54,074
I'll scout ahead.

623
00:32:56,008 --> 00:32:58,078
I'm sorry for
all the trouble
I've put you through.

624
00:32:58,077 --> 00:32:59,637
You don't have to
apologize to me, Clary.

625
00:32:59,645 --> 00:33:01,235
Unfortunately,
you can't stop me.

626
00:33:01,246 --> 00:33:03,476
[chuckles] Well, yeah,
I'm starting to see that.

627
00:33:04,683 --> 00:33:07,153
Just... I've been so focused
on trying to find my mom,

628
00:33:07,152 --> 00:33:09,852
I don't think I
realized how much
you've actually done for me.

629
00:33:10,656 --> 00:33:11,886
So, thank you.

630
00:33:12,791 --> 00:33:14,121
Clary, I'm a Shadowhunter.

631
00:33:14,126 --> 00:33:16,126
It's kinda my job.

632
00:33:16,128 --> 00:33:17,488
You... Your job?

633
00:33:17,496 --> 00:33:18,826
Yeah.

634
00:33:18,831 --> 00:33:20,531
Oh, you'd do this
for anybody?

635
00:33:21,633 --> 00:33:23,173
Maybe not Simon.

636
00:33:23,168 --> 00:33:25,168
Funny, I think he'd say
the same thing about you.

637
00:33:25,170 --> 00:33:26,840
You know, you're not
too bad yourself.

638
00:33:26,839 --> 00:33:28,169
Me?
Yeah.

639
00:33:28,173 --> 00:33:30,843
You kicked some
pretty serious ass
back at the police station.

640
00:33:30,843 --> 00:33:32,683
At least, you got
my ass kicked.

641
00:33:32,678 --> 00:33:34,848
Thanks... I think.

642
00:33:34,847 --> 00:33:36,107
[necklace pulsing]

643
00:33:37,182 --> 00:33:39,752
Guys? It's pulsing.

644
00:33:41,020 --> 00:33:42,320
Again?

645
00:33:42,321 --> 00:33:44,591
Getting close.
Let's spread out.

646
00:33:46,225 --> 00:33:47,615
[faint chittering]

647
00:33:48,827 --> 00:33:50,027
Izzy, where is it?

648
00:33:50,029 --> 00:33:51,189
I don't know.

649
00:33:51,196 --> 00:33:53,196
It's like they're right here,
but I don't see them.

650
00:33:53,198 --> 00:33:54,558
[snarling]

651
00:33:54,566 --> 00:33:56,096
[clattering]

652
00:34:00,472 --> 00:34:01,642
[screeching]

653
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:02,770
[Clary screams]
[grunts]

654
00:34:04,743 --> 00:34:05,983
[grunting]

655
00:34:07,212 --> 00:34:08,452
[snarling]

656
00:34:09,681 --> 00:34:10,981
[gasps]

657
00:34:13,552 --> 00:34:15,592
[Jace grunts]
[gasps]

658
00:34:15,587 --> 00:34:18,087
Are you hurt?
I'll live.

659
00:34:18,090 --> 00:34:19,720
What are those things?

660
00:34:19,725 --> 00:34:21,215
Shax demons.

661
00:34:21,226 --> 00:34:22,686
They're like
the bloodhounds
of the Shadow World.

662
00:34:22,694 --> 00:34:24,594
They've been tracking us.
So what do we do?

663
00:34:24,596 --> 00:34:26,896
The Institute's only
a couple of blocks
from here.

664
00:34:26,899 --> 00:34:28,429
We can't lose them,
but they won't

665
00:34:28,434 --> 00:34:30,004
be able to track us
if we split up.

666
00:34:30,002 --> 00:34:31,232
But, I don't... I don't--

667
00:34:31,236 --> 00:34:32,436
Clary, you'll be fine.

668
00:34:32,438 --> 00:34:34,138
Izzy and I will
draw them away.

669
00:34:35,374 --> 00:34:36,614
No matter what happens,
just keep running.

670
00:34:36,608 --> 00:34:38,038
[snarling]
They're coming.

671
00:34:38,043 --> 00:34:39,813
Jace, I--
Run, Clary!

672
00:34:41,013 --> 00:34:42,983
[panting]

673
00:34:51,356 --> 00:34:53,116
[creature chitters]
Crap!

674
00:34:53,125 --> 00:34:54,515
[screeching]

675
00:34:54,526 --> 00:34:56,586
[whimpering]

676
00:35:07,106 --> 00:35:08,306
[screeching]

677
00:35:10,142 --> 00:35:12,012
Get back!

678
00:35:12,744 --> 00:35:14,184
I said, get back!

679
00:35:29,094 --> 00:35:31,034
[knocking on door]
[Elaine] Simon?

680
00:35:32,164 --> 00:35:34,204
[sighs] You
still alive in there?

681
00:35:35,134 --> 00:35:36,874
Hey, I ordered in Rizzo's.

682
00:35:39,972 --> 00:35:41,042
Are you okay?

683
00:35:41,039 --> 00:35:44,369
I've never heard him
this quiet
around pasta before.

684
00:35:45,644 --> 00:35:47,144
Go.
Yeah? Okay.

685
00:35:47,146 --> 00:35:49,376
All right, Simon,
I'm coming in.

686
00:35:55,521 --> 00:35:57,751
[gasps] Simon?

687
00:36:01,493 --> 00:36:02,693
Oh, my God.

688
00:36:14,339 --> 00:36:15,439
Jace!

689
00:36:17,809 --> 00:36:19,479
Jace?

690
00:36:19,478 --> 00:36:20,678
Clary.

691
00:36:22,548 --> 00:36:23,608
Hey.

692
00:36:25,217 --> 00:36:27,217
Oh, you're hurt!
I'll be all right.

693
00:36:27,219 --> 00:36:29,149
You okay?
Yeah, I'm...

694
00:36:29,154 --> 00:36:30,524
I'm fine. Barely, but--

695
00:36:30,522 --> 00:36:32,862
What happened?
One of the Shax
demons cornered me.

696
00:36:32,858 --> 00:36:34,318
But I got the Cup.

697
00:36:34,326 --> 00:36:37,686
I don't know,
my instincts just kicked in
and I... I could do it.

698
00:36:37,696 --> 00:36:40,696
Maybe you're right.
Maybe I'll be
a Shadowhunter after all.

699
00:36:40,699 --> 00:36:43,329
Clary, you're amazing.
I always knew you could do it.

700
00:36:43,335 --> 00:36:44,725
Now give me
the Cup and let's go.

701
00:36:44,736 --> 00:36:47,236
[scoffs] Give you the Cup?
Yes.

702
00:36:47,239 --> 00:36:49,839
Only until we get back
to the Institute.

703
00:36:49,841 --> 00:36:51,641
It's the only way
I can keep you safe.

704
00:36:51,643 --> 00:36:54,113
I'll die before I let
anything happen to you.

705
00:36:54,813 --> 00:36:56,853
Yeah, you're totally right.

706
00:36:56,848 --> 00:36:58,078
[grunts]

707
00:36:59,685 --> 00:37:01,745
Clary? [breathing heavily]

708
00:37:03,055 --> 00:37:04,745
Jace... No! Oh, my God! Jace!

709
00:37:04,756 --> 00:37:06,416
[gasps]

710
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:10,130
[shuddering]

711
00:37:12,864 --> 00:37:14,304
[snarling]

712
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:17,500
[roars]

713
00:37:32,918 --> 00:37:34,578
[Luke] Clary!
Get back!

714
00:37:34,586 --> 00:37:35,746
How do I know
you're Luke?

715
00:37:35,754 --> 00:37:38,524
[Luke] I got you spray paint
for your birthday.

716
00:37:39,591 --> 00:37:41,861
What happened?
Uh, demons.

717
00:37:43,128 --> 00:37:45,758
Long story. Um...
[breathing heavily]

718
00:37:45,764 --> 00:37:48,064
Where'd you come from?
Jail.

719
00:37:48,066 --> 00:37:50,116
I ran into Alec.

720
00:37:50,117 --> 00:37:52,167
Said you might be down here.
Thought you
might need some help.

721
00:37:52,871 --> 00:37:55,941
Apparently not.
Looks like she
took care of it.

722
00:37:55,941 --> 00:37:57,271
Shouldn't we get
going or something?

723
00:37:57,276 --> 00:37:58,436
More demons could
be coming, right?

724
00:37:58,443 --> 00:37:59,543
Oh, don't worry about it.

725
00:37:59,544 --> 00:38:00,944
I got the pack
on the lookout.

726
00:38:00,946 --> 00:38:02,446
If there's any other demons,
we'll take care of them.

727
00:38:02,447 --> 00:38:04,477
[chuckles] Look at you,
leader of the pack.

728
00:38:04,483 --> 00:38:06,123
Well, you know,
it has its perks.

729
00:38:07,386 --> 00:38:08,886
Shall we?

730
00:38:09,788 --> 00:38:11,988
Yeah. Right.

731
00:38:12,924 --> 00:38:15,434
These tunnels
are swarming
with Shax demons.

732
00:38:15,427 --> 00:38:17,827
If she's down there,
it's only a matter of time
before they find her.

733
00:38:17,829 --> 00:38:19,559
We need to make sure
that doesn't happen.

734
00:38:19,564 --> 00:38:22,574
All right, listen up.
I want this entire
institute on high alert.

735
00:38:22,567 --> 00:38:26,067
I don't care what
anybody else says,
I'll take full responsibility.

736
00:38:26,071 --> 00:38:27,941
Right now,
Clary is the only
thing that matters.

737
00:38:27,939 --> 00:38:29,009
Jace!

738
00:38:29,808 --> 00:38:30,968
Clary.

739
00:38:36,114 --> 00:38:38,054
I did it. I got the Cup.

740
00:38:39,318 --> 00:38:41,318
I don't care
about the Cup.

741
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:43,420
When I came out of
the tunnels, I didn't
see you. I was worried

742
00:38:43,422 --> 00:38:45,122
something might
have happened--
There was a demon.

743
00:38:45,123 --> 00:38:46,923
Shapeshifter.
It looked just like you.

744
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:51,760
You all right?
Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.

745
00:38:51,763 --> 00:38:53,433
And the demon?

746
00:38:53,432 --> 00:38:55,072
I sent him
straight back to hell.

747
00:38:56,168 --> 00:38:57,228
How'd you know
it wasn't me?

748
00:38:58,804 --> 00:39:01,674
I just knew.
Really?

749
00:39:01,673 --> 00:39:02,873
Kind of a risk,
wasn't it?

750
00:39:03,842 --> 00:39:05,542
Well, this may
come as a surprise,

751
00:39:05,544 --> 00:39:08,284
but I actually do listen
to some of
the things you tell me.

752
00:39:09,848 --> 00:39:12,248
You just have to pay
attention to the details.

753
00:39:12,851 --> 00:39:16,521
Yeah, well,
I told you the first time
we met, you have the Sight.

754
00:39:16,521 --> 00:39:19,061
You're a Shadowhunter,
just like the rest of us.

760
00:40:11,576 --> 00:40:13,006
[Simon] Hello?

761
00:40:16,782 --> 00:40:18,152
Anybody home?

762
00:40:23,088 --> 00:40:25,588
You don't have
a doorbell, so I...
I let myself in.

763
00:40:29,094 --> 00:40:30,334
Raphael?

764
00:40:33,432 --> 00:40:36,202
[whispering]
Okay, okay.
Oh, my God.

765
00:40:36,201 --> 00:40:38,271
All right, I know
someone's here somewhere!

766
00:40:39,371 --> 00:40:40,601
Please!

767
00:40:43,208 --> 00:40:44,838
I think I'm sick.

768
00:40:47,979 --> 00:40:51,549
I need someone to
tell me what's going on,
because it's ruining my life!

769
00:40:56,955 --> 00:40:58,955
Am I becoming a vampire?

770
00:40:58,957 --> 00:41:00,817
[Camille laughing]

771
00:41:00,826 --> 00:41:04,186
Poor darling boy.

772
00:41:06,331 --> 00:41:08,631
I was wondering
when you'd come back.

773
00:41:09,968 --> 00:41:11,528
You...

774
00:41:12,771 --> 00:41:14,041
You're not mad?

775
00:41:14,573 --> 00:41:18,543
On the contrary,
I've been expecting you.

776
00:41:19,978 --> 00:41:25,248
You see...
it's just my blood running
through your veins.

777
00:41:27,185 --> 00:41:29,585
It can have some
curious effects.

778
00:41:31,323 --> 00:41:33,523
But I assure you,
they're all harmless.

779
00:41:35,427 --> 00:41:39,057
In time, they'll fade
and you'll return to normal.

00:41:40,265 --> 00:41:41,695
[shudders]

781
00:41:43,668 --> 00:41:46,338
Thank God. Um...

782
00:41:46,338 --> 00:41:50,108
[stuttering]
But I'm okay?
I'm still human?

783
00:41:50,108 --> 00:41:52,108
Well, of course you are.

784
00:41:54,513 --> 00:41:56,113
Or at least you would've been.
