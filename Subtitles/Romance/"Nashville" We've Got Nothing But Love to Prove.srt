00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,440
You know, Cadence really missed
you yesterday. What happened?

176
00:06:04,476 --> 00:06:05,408
Were you sick or something?

177
00:06:05,443 --> 00:06:07,777
I was with Juliette.

178
00:06:07,812 --> 00:06:09,579
And I don't want to lie to you about it.

179
00:06:09,614 --> 00:06:11,180
She's back in town?

180
00:06:11,216 --> 00:06:14,117
No, not yet, but I got a
text from her a few days ago.

181
00:06:14,152 --> 00:06:15,752
Oh, what do you mean a few days ago?

182
00:06:15,787 --> 00:06:17,120
I didn't know if I should tell you.

183
00:06:17,155 --> 00:06:18,688
Of course you should tell me.

184
00:06:18,723 --> 00:06:19,889
I mean, we're... we're friends.

185
00:06:19,924 --> 00:06:22,925
I know, but Juliette's a
friend, too, and she's...

186
00:06:22,961 --> 00:06:25,361
The one who pays your salary?

187
00:06:25,397 --> 00:06:26,429
- Look...

188
00:06:26,464 --> 00:06:28,031
...I was skeptical, too.

189
00:06:28,066 --> 00:06:30,700
But it turns out she left
Luke's tour to go into rehab.

190
00:06:30,735 --> 00:06:32,268
And now that she's clean,
she's checked herself

191
00:06:32,304 --> 00:06:34,337
into a treatment center
for postpartum depression.

192
00:06:34,372 --> 00:06:36,773
Avery, she knows she's sick.

193
00:06:36,808 --> 00:06:38,641
And she's working with
this amazing doctor.

194
00:06:38,677 --> 00:06:40,276
No, em, she's manipulating you.

195

She knows I won't talk to her,

196
00:06:41,613 --> 00:06:42,979

197

- That is exactly what she's doing!</i>

Juliette hates herself
for what she's done,

200
00:06:47,118 --> 00:06:48,451
and... and she's afraid to face you.

201
00:06:48,486 --> 00:06:50,853
You know what? I can't
deal with this right now.

202
00:06:50,889 --> 00:06:52,188
You should leave.

203
00:06:52,223 --> 00:06:53,589
Avery, I'm here to watch Cadence.

204
00:06:53,625 --> 00:06:54,757
Not anymore.

it's midnight on a Tuesday,

killing it, you know?

heard the night before.

Listen, I'm looking
forward to this record,

taking your little detour

into country music
particularly seriously.

this... just a bit of a lark?

not that much difference

and all I can say

is everybody can
download the album tonight

291
00:10:10,321 --> 00:10:11,220

irregularities with the label

your personal finances

299

At least then you could
protect some of your assets.

No, the most important
thing to protect right now

306
00:10:41,919 --> 00:10:44,854
is the brand, and
"bankruptcy" is an ugly word

307

when it comes to business.

308
00:10:46,057 --> 00:10:48,524
Agreed, but so are "back taxes."

We need to handle this as
quickly and quietly as possible.

Say you're sorry. Admit
you're a crazy person.

522
00:18:59,043 --> 00:19:01,777
Just... just get her back.

523
00:19:06,417 --> 00:19:08,817
So, I got some good news recently.

524
00:19:08,853 --> 00:19:10,552
Hmm?

525
00:19:10,588 --> 00:19:12,588
A job offer.

526
00:19:12,623 --> 00:19:14,823
- Promotion, actually.
- Hmm.

527
00:19:14,859 --> 00:19:17,493
I would be the head
of my own department.

528
00:19:18,796 --> 00:19:21,864
That's incredible! Why
didn't you say anything?

529
00:19:21,899 --> 00:19:23,365
Well, I didn't think I was gonna get it.

530
00:19:23,401 --> 00:19:24,900
When they called, I was shocked.

531
00:19:24,935 --> 00:19:26,435
I'm not. I knew you were amazing.

532
00:19:27,772 --> 00:19:29,004
Well done.

533
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:30,506
There's a catch.

I'm part of a duo, though,
so it's not just about me.

538
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:41,850
Uh, s-sorry, how would that even work?

539
00:19:41,886 --> 00:19:45,354
Well, I know that I
blindsided you with this, so...

540
00:19:45,389 --> 00:19:47,555
We obviously have some
things to figure out.

Yeah.

let's sleep on it.

We don't need to
decide anything tonight.

If we're gonna work together,

I got to say, uh... you were right.

far [Chuckles] but...

What does that mean?

Oh, nothing. It does not bear repeating.

Seriously, what?

00:22:45,161 --> 00:22:48,162
Well, I mean, after that whole
conversation I had with him,

621
00:22:48,197 --> 00:22:50,598
he still tries to kiss me at
the end of the night last night.

Could anybody be that stupid, you know?

623

- Where is he, Rayna?
- What do you mean?

What hotel is he at?
Where is he right now?

have it under control, Rayna!

to be fighting about.

hard work, is pointless,

her way back into our lives.

repair their relationship...

00:24:38,541 --> 00:24:40,674
Oh, Bucky didn't tell you?

674
00:24:40,710 --> 00:24:43,477
Yeah, um, bandmates called
me to congratulate me,

675
00:24:43,512 --> 00:24:45,779
and we started talking, and
one thing led to another,

676

between us, we can fix.

'cause I know how much it means to you.

1044
00:39:55,807 --> 00:39:57,607
I just got jealous, you know?

1045
00:39:57,643 --> 00:39:59,309
And not because you did anything wrong

1046
00:39:59,344 --> 00:40:01,778
or because I thought Markus
was gonna take you away from me.

1047
00:40:01,813 --> 00:40:04,147
It's just...

1048
00:40:04,182 --> 00:40:06,750
All that time in the studio,
that used to be us, baby.

1049
00:40:06,785 --> 00:40:08,985
That was me.

1050
00:40:09,021 --> 00:40:10,987
You know how it is when
two people are making music.

1051
00:40:11,023 --> 00:40:13,156
It's just so...

1052
00:40:13,191 --> 00:40:15,892
so damn intimate.

1053
00:40:15,928 --> 00:40:18,728
I know. I miss you, and I need you.

1054
00:40:18,764 --> 00:40:19,963
I'm right here, baby.

1055
00:40:26,438 --> 00:40:29,072
[Chuckling] God.

1056
00:40:29,107 --> 00:40:32,742
Sometimes I just wish I could
do everything all over again.

1057
00:40:32,778 --> 00:40:34,945
What would you change?

1058
00:40:34,980 --> 00:40:36,146
Everything.

1059
00:40:38,850 --> 00:40:40,417
Nothing.

1060
00:40:42,254 --> 00:40:44,020
Except this.

1061
00:40:50,762 --> 00:40:52,562
Baby, I love you so much.

1062
00:40:55,033 --> 00:40:56,600
Will you marry me?

1063
00:40:56,635 --> 00:40:59,169
[Sighs]

1064
00:40:59,204 --> 00:41:00,670
[Voice breaking] Yeah.

1065
00:41:03,675 --> 00:41:05,175
[Chuckles, sniffles]

1066
00:41:05,210 --> 00:41:06,576
Yeah?

1067
00:41:13,318 --> 00:41:15,485
[Chuckles]

1068
