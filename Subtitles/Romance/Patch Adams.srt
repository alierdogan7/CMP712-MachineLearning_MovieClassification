1
00:01:03,879 --> 00:01:06,814
All of life is a coming home.

2
00:01:06,882 --> 00:01:11,148
Salesmen, secretaries, coal miners,
beekeepers, sword swallowers--

3
00:01:11,219 --> 00:01:13,153
all of us.

4
00:01:13,221 --> 00:01:16,486
All the restless hearts
of the world...

5
00:01:16,558 --> 00:01:19,493
all trying
to find a way home.

6
00:01:21,697 --> 00:01:25,098
It's hard to describe
what I felt like then.

7
00:01:25,167 --> 00:01:28,603
Picture yourself walking
for days in a driving snow.

8
00:01:28,670 --> 00:01:31,605
You don't even know
you're walking in circles--

9
00:01:31,673 --> 00:01:34,608
the heaviness of your legs
in the drifts;

10
00:01:34,676 --> 00:01:37,042
your shouts
disappearing into the wind.

11
00:01:37,112 --> 00:01:39,342
How small you can feel.

12
00:01:39,414 --> 00:01:42,212
How far away home can be.

13
00:01:59,368 --> 00:02:01,393
Home.

14
00:02:01,470 --> 00:02:04,906
The dictionary defines it
as both a place of origin...

15
00:02:04,973 --> 00:02:07,032
and a goal or destination.

16
00:02:08,477 --> 00:02:10,411
And the storm?

17
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:13,243
The storm was all in my mind.

18
00:02:13,315 --> 00:02:15,579
Or, as the poet Dante put it...

19
00:02:15,651 --> 00:02:19,348
"In the middle of the journey of my life
I found myself in a dark wood...

20
00:02:19,421 --> 00:02:21,855
for I had lost
the right path."

21
00:02:22,991 --> 00:02:25,789
Eventually I would find
the right path...

22
00:02:25,861 --> 00:02:28,694
but in the most unlikely place.

23
00:03:00,529 --> 00:03:02,463
How many fingers
do you see?

24
00:03:02,531 --> 00:03:04,965
You crazy--
Stop sneakin' up on me like that.

25
00:03:05,033 --> 00:03:06,762
How many?

26
00:03:06,835 --> 00:03:09,463
- Four.
- Four?

27
00:03:09,538 --> 00:03:11,972
Four?

28
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:13,974
Another idiot.

29
00:03:15,143 --> 00:03:17,202
You gon' love it here.

30
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:20,714
Got a new one, Jane.
Hunter Adams.

31
00:03:20,782 --> 00:03:23,717
Self-committed. Suicidal.
Slate him with Dr. Prack.

32
00:03:23,785 --> 00:03:25,719
All right.

33
00:03:33,161 --> 00:03:36,289
Hey, Rudy!
What's the word, my man?

34
00:03:36,364 --> 00:03:39,925
He ain't left that bed in three weeks.
He won't give you any trouble.

35
00:03:40,001 --> 00:03:43,232
He needs another bedpan. They're in
the closet. Wake-up is 7:00 a.m.

36
00:03:43,305 --> 00:03:45,239
Excuse me.

37
00:03:45,307 --> 00:03:48,299
Is there any way
I could have my own room?

38
00:03:49,711 --> 00:03:51,838
Oh, absolutely.

39
00:03:51,913 --> 00:03:54,643
Just call the concierge and ask
for a suite overlooking the fountain.

40
00:03:54,716 --> 00:03:57,150
No, l-l prefer
the cabana room.

41
00:03:57,219 --> 00:03:59,278
Get some sleep.

42
00:04:10,332 --> 00:04:12,266
Hi.

43
00:04:14,136 --> 00:04:16,195
Hi.

44
00:04:19,908 --> 00:04:21,842
You're, um...

45
00:04:23,044 --> 00:04:26,707
you're a lot... fuzzier
than my last roommate.

46
00:04:26,782 --> 00:04:28,374
Oh. Yeah.

47
00:04:28,450 --> 00:04:30,384
Keeps me warm.

48
00:04:31,453 --> 00:04:34,013
Aaaah!

49
00:04:36,191 --> 00:04:38,819
- What's wrong?
- Get 'em away!

50
00:04:38,894 --> 00:04:41,727
- Get what away?
- Get 'em-- Get 'em away!

51
00:04:41,797 --> 00:04:44,288
- Okay, I'm gonna have to--
- You traitor!

52
00:04:44,366 --> 00:04:48,496
You brought 'em with you
when you opened the door!

53
00:04:48,570 --> 00:04:51,368
Who?

54
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:56,310
We need help in here!

55
00:04:56,378 --> 00:04:58,312
Somebody!

56
00:05:00,882 --> 00:05:02,816
- All right.
- No! No! No!

57
00:05:02,884 --> 00:05:06,911
They'll get me! Don't take me down!
They'll get me! No!

58
00:05:06,988 --> 00:05:09,923
Don't let the squirrels get me!
Please!

59
00:05:09,991 --> 00:05:11,720
Don't let the squirrels get me!

60
00:05:14,796 --> 00:05:17,731
That was a squirrel bite!

61
00:05:17,799 --> 00:05:19,892
Squirrels.

62
00:05:22,237 --> 00:05:25,172
My father died when I was nine.

63
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:29,336
He was in the army.
He wasn't home very much.

64
00:05:30,478 --> 00:05:33,413
Two weeks before he died...

65
00:05:33,481 --> 00:05:36,416
he told me that
in the Korean War...

66
00:05:36,484 --> 00:05:38,918
it felt like
he'd lost his soul.

67
00:05:38,987 --> 00:05:42,582
All this time
I thought it was me.

68
00:05:42,657 --> 00:05:46,593
I moved seven times
in the last year.

69
00:05:46,661 --> 00:05:49,255
I've, uh, had several jobs.

70
00:05:51,166 --> 00:05:53,100
Nothing seemed to fit.

71
00:05:53,168 --> 00:05:55,102
I don't seem to fit.

72
00:05:57,672 --> 00:06:01,039
And when your father died,
how did that make you feel?

73
00:06:01,109 --> 00:06:03,873
I don't know.
I was nine.

74
00:06:05,447 --> 00:06:08,780
It was like there was
this distinction, suddenly...

75
00:06:08,850 --> 00:06:11,785
between you
and the rest of the world.

76
00:06:11,853 --> 00:06:13,787
I looked around me.

77
00:06:13,855 --> 00:06:17,416
Life went on
just like it did before.

78
00:06:17,492 --> 00:06:20,757
But it wasn't
like it was before.

79
00:06:20,829 --> 00:06:23,764
My uncle helped.
He would visit.

80
00:06:23,832 --> 00:06:25,766
He at least listened.

81
00:06:27,469 --> 00:06:29,460
And I thought...

82
00:06:29,537 --> 00:06:34,497
if I could light my own farts I could
fly to the moon, or at least Uranus.

83
00:06:34,576 --> 00:06:38,103
But if I couldn't do that at least
I could use my penis as a pogo stick...

84
00:06:38,179 --> 00:06:41,114
and that might be a way
of getting around.

85
00:06:41,182 --> 00:06:43,480
I'm sorry?

86
00:06:43,551 --> 00:06:45,485
Yes, that's good.
Mm-hmm.

87
00:06:47,289 --> 00:06:50,781
Well, I think you're making
fine progress, Hunter.
We'll talk later in group.

88
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:53,794
Thank you.

89
00:07:02,570 --> 00:07:07,007
Four. Four? Four!

90
00:07:07,075 --> 00:07:10,374
Ohh! Four! Ohh!

91
00:07:10,445 --> 00:07:14,506
You are all insane!
lnsane! Four!

92
00:07:14,582 --> 00:07:16,675
Arthur Mendelson.

93
00:07:18,086 --> 00:07:20,020
The Arthur Mendelson?

94
00:07:20,088 --> 00:07:22,215
Brand Beaton lndustries.

95
00:07:22,290 --> 00:07:25,225
Guy was one of the most
innovative minds of our time.

96
00:07:25,293 --> 00:07:28,228
Look at him now.
He can't even count the windows.

97
00:07:30,365 --> 00:07:33,300
God. What happened to him?
Why is he here?

98
00:07:33,368 --> 00:07:37,065
Self-committed. Genius syndrome.
Howard Hughes-type shit.

99
00:07:37,138 --> 00:07:40,665
Constantly digging into the
creative potential of the human mind.

100
00:07:43,244 --> 00:07:45,508
I guess he dug too deep.

101
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:47,548
This is real wood.

102
00:07:47,615 --> 00:07:50,175
Rowff!

103
00:07:53,421 --> 00:07:57,016
W-Why are we meeting in here?
It's cramped.

104
00:07:57,092 --> 00:08:00,528
Well, Everton, we're meeting in here
so that Rudy can participate.

105
00:08:00,595 --> 00:08:03,564
- It's cramped.
- Does anyone else
have a thought on that?

106
00:08:03,631 --> 00:08:06,998
- Cramped!
- I think he has a question.

107
00:08:09,070 --> 00:08:12,506
Do you find that funny, Hunter,
making fun of a man's infirmity?

108
00:08:12,574 --> 00:08:15,168
Maybe he does have a question.
He's alive.

109
00:08:15,243 --> 00:08:18,178
- He's catatonic.
- Well, he still has a brain.

110
00:08:18,246 --> 00:08:21,010
- Maybe he wants to participate too.
- Yeah.

111
00:08:21,082 --> 00:08:23,016
Maybe he has a question.

112
00:08:23,084 --> 00:08:25,018
Yeah, maybe.

113
00:08:25,086 --> 00:08:27,281
Maybe he knows why we're cramped!

114
00:08:30,358 --> 00:08:33,953
Maybe Beany knows a lot more
than we give him credit for.

115
00:08:34,029 --> 00:08:36,930
Excuse me. Beany?
Which way is heaven?

116
00:08:36,998 --> 00:08:38,932
That's correct!

117
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,467
That'll be enough, Hunter.

118
00:08:40,535 --> 00:08:43,595
Beany, how much taller
is Wilt Chamberlain than you?

119
00:08:43,671 --> 00:08:45,798
- Right.

120
00:08:45,874 --> 00:08:49,037
Hey, Beany! Beany!
Where's the ceiling?

121
00:08:49,110 --> 00:08:51,408
That's enough. Stop it.

122
00:08:51,479 --> 00:08:54,039
Where do the birds fly, Beany?

123
00:08:54,115 --> 00:08:56,049
How do you say hello to Hitler?

124
00:08:56,117 --> 00:08:59,917
Beany, how does Hitler say hello?

125
00:09:01,356 --> 00:09:05,725
How do you check
an elephant for a hernia?

126
00:09:05,794 --> 00:09:09,127
Who would win a staring contest?
Beany!

127
00:09:09,197 --> 00:09:11,165
Who-- Who farted?

128
00:09:11,232 --> 00:09:13,325
Beany!

129
00:09:13,401 --> 00:09:16,268
- Who likes to masturbate?
- Yea!

130
00:09:16,337 --> 00:09:18,305
I do! I do!

131
00:09:18,373 --> 00:09:22,309
Hey, Beany, how does an
one-armed referee say "field goal"?

132
00:09:22,377 --> 00:09:24,004
Ha ha! Hey, Beany!

133
00:09:24,079 --> 00:09:27,446
Ciao, Beany!
Arigato, Beany!

134
00:09:27,515 --> 00:09:29,449
Bye, Beany.

135
00:09:31,986 --> 00:09:34,045
It was a really good session,
I thought.

136
00:09:50,126 --> 00:09:52,060
May I come in?

137
00:09:53,363 --> 00:09:55,797
If you bend your medial
collateral ligaments...

138
00:09:55,865 --> 00:09:58,299
and place one talus
in front of another...

139
00:09:58,368 --> 00:10:00,802
I don't see where
you'd have a problem.

140
00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:03,805
Of course, if there were a news story
covering this event...

141
00:10:03,873 --> 00:10:06,899
the headline might read:
"Small Brain Enters Room."

142
00:10:09,412 --> 00:10:12,245
The fingers.
What's the answer?

143
00:10:12,315 --> 00:10:15,250
Oh, you're another one of
those bright young fellows...

144
00:10:15,318 --> 00:10:18,253
who always know the right answer,
is that it?

145
00:10:18,321 --> 00:10:20,482
Welcome to real life.

146
00:10:55,992 --> 00:10:57,926
How many do you see?

147
00:11:00,463 --> 00:11:03,398
- There are four fingers, Arthur.
- No, no, no. Look at me.

148
00:11:03,466 --> 00:11:05,229
What?

149
00:11:05,301 --> 00:11:07,235
Y-You're focusing
on the problem.

150
00:11:07,303 --> 00:11:10,397
If you focus on the problem,
you can't see the solution.

151
00:11:10,473 --> 00:11:13,670
Never focus on the problem.
Look at me!

152
00:11:14,977 --> 00:11:17,571
How many do you see?

153
00:11:19,248 --> 00:11:22,843
No, look beyond the fingers.

154
00:11:22,919 --> 00:11:24,853
How many do you see?

155
00:11:30,426 --> 00:11:32,360
Eight.

156
00:11:32,428 --> 00:11:35,420
Eight. Eight.
Yes! Yes!

157
00:11:35,498 --> 00:11:38,467
Eight's a good answer.
Yes.

158
00:11:38,534 --> 00:11:40,934
See what no one else sees.

159
00:11:41,003 --> 00:11:43,733
See what everyone else
chooses not to see...

160
00:11:43,806 --> 00:11:46,866
out of fear
and conformity and laziness.

161
00:11:46,943 --> 00:11:50,242
See the whole world anew
each day.

162
00:11:51,747 --> 00:11:54,682
Ah, the truth is,
you're well on the way.

163
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:57,685
If you didn't
see something here...

164
00:11:57,753 --> 00:12:01,018
besides a crazy,
bitter old man...

165
00:12:01,090 --> 00:12:04,025
you wouldn't have come
in the first place.

166
00:12:07,530 --> 00:12:10,465
What do you see
when you look at me, Arthur?

167
00:12:14,704 --> 00:12:16,638
You fixed my cup.

168
00:12:18,207 --> 00:12:20,141
I'll see you around...

169
00:12:21,444 --> 00:12:23,378
Patch.

170
00:12:31,153 --> 00:12:33,587
Rudy, stop.

171
00:12:33,656 --> 00:12:36,090
You're throwing off
my rhythm.

172
00:12:36,158 --> 00:12:38,092
You'll go blind.

173
00:12:39,262 --> 00:12:41,924
- Please.
- I have to go to the bathroom.

174
00:12:41,998 --> 00:12:45,934
Then go. It's right over there,
15 feet away.

175
00:12:46,002 --> 00:12:49,961
- I would, but--
- But what? The squirrels?

176
00:12:50,039 --> 00:12:52,473
- How many?
- There's only one just now.

177
00:12:53,809 --> 00:12:56,903
You can't go to the bathroom
because of one squirrel?

178
00:12:56,979 --> 00:12:59,812
If I get off the bed,
he'll get the others.

179
00:13:01,050 --> 00:13:02,984
That's not the point.

180
00:13:03,052 --> 00:13:04,986
They're squirrels.

181
00:13:05,054 --> 00:13:07,079
Squirrels, Rudy.

182
00:13:07,156 --> 00:13:11,092
- They're one of the most amiable
creatures on the planet.
- Oh, no, they're not.

183
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:14,095
On the list of hostile predators,
they're right above the bottom...

184
00:13:14,163 --> 00:13:16,757
just above baby chicks
and slugs.

185
00:13:16,832 --> 00:13:19,323
What could they possibly want?
Your nuts?

186
00:13:20,403 --> 00:13:22,837
- Do you think?
- Oh, Rudy.

187
00:13:22,905 --> 00:13:25,999
- Come on, I'll take you.
- Don't move.

188
00:13:26,075 --> 00:13:29,340
- Don't move.
- Another one?

189
00:13:30,813 --> 00:13:34,146
It's on the end of your bed,
on the rail.

190
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:41,189
Be careful.
It's gonna jump.

191
00:13:53,235 --> 00:13:55,795
- There's one, at the end of the bed!
- Bang!

192
00:13:55,871 --> 00:13:58,806
There's one runnin'
across the sprinkler!

193
00:13:58,874 --> 00:14:01,206
- Boom!
- In back of the door!
Back of the door!

194
00:14:01,277 --> 00:14:04,212
Coming out of the bathroom!

195
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:06,714
Bathroom! Bathroom!
Bathroom! Bathroom!

196
00:14:06,782 --> 00:14:09,182
Yea!

197
00:14:09,251 --> 00:14:12,982
Eat lead, fur bag!
Blam! Ha-ha!

198
00:14:13,055 --> 00:14:16,491
- You're cured-- Aaah!
- You've got one on your shoulder!

199
00:14:16,559 --> 00:14:19,187
Get it off me! Get it off me!

200
00:14:19,261 --> 00:14:22,594
Get it off me! Aaaah!

201
00:14:24,233 --> 00:14:27,168
We need more cover!
They're comin' in the back door!

202
00:14:27,236 --> 00:14:30,763
- Get under cover, Rudy!
- Build a fort! Build a fort!
We can build a fort!

203
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:35,106
- We need a fort!
- Aaah! Down! Get down!

204
00:14:38,881 --> 00:14:40,815
They're gone.

205
00:14:40,883 --> 00:14:43,818
I think it's safe to go
to the bathroom, Rudy. Come on.

206
00:14:43,886 --> 00:14:46,480
- No, it's too risky.
- No.

207
00:14:46,555 --> 00:14:48,489
Not when you have...

208
00:14:49,558 --> 00:14:51,492
this.

209
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:54,495
- A bazooka.
- Yeah.

210
00:14:54,563 --> 00:14:56,497
Load.

211
00:15:01,070 --> 00:15:04,301
- Let's do it!
- Aaaah!

212
00:15:21,757 --> 00:15:23,691
Yes.

213
00:15:31,801 --> 00:15:33,735
I'd like to leave.

214
00:15:35,304 --> 00:15:38,467
Hunter, we'll have to discuss this
at your scheduled time.

215
00:15:38,541 --> 00:15:40,475
I'm leaving.

216
00:15:41,577 --> 00:15:43,511
Have you thought
about what you'll do?

217
00:15:43,579 --> 00:15:46,013
I want to help people.

218
00:15:46,082 --> 00:15:49,574
Last night with Rudy,
I connected to another human being.

219
00:15:49,652 --> 00:15:53,918
I want more of that.
I want to learn about people,
help them with their troubles.

220
00:15:53,989 --> 00:15:56,321
- That's what I do.
- But you suck at it.

221
00:15:56,392 --> 00:15:59,327
You don't even look at people
when they're talking.

222
00:15:59,395 --> 00:16:01,989
I want to listen,
really listen to people.

223
00:16:02,064 --> 00:16:06,592
I can't allow you to leave. I believe
you still have some issues to work out.

224
00:16:06,669 --> 00:16:10,105
Ah. Well, I don't need your permission
because I admitted myself.

225
00:16:10,172 --> 00:16:12,106
- Hunter.
- Mm-hmm?

226
00:16:12,174 --> 00:16:15,610
I must warn you
my report will read "A.M.A."--

227
00:16:15,678 --> 00:16:18,841
that you were signed out of this
hospital "against medical advice."

228
00:16:18,914 --> 00:16:22,008
And my report will read
"I.D.G.A.R.A."

229
00:16:22,084 --> 00:16:24,518
"I don't give a rat's ass."

230
00:16:25,921 --> 00:16:27,855
And my name is Patch.

231
00:17:03,305 --> 00:17:05,739
Hello.
How you doin'?

232
00:17:05,808 --> 00:17:07,742
How do you do?

233
00:17:10,045 --> 00:17:12,479
Hey, this is a nice room.

234
00:17:12,548 --> 00:17:16,143
- May I help you?
- Yeah, I could really use
a foot massage right now.

235
00:17:17,553 --> 00:17:19,487
Rephrasing:
What are you doing here?

236
00:17:19,555 --> 00:17:21,989
I'm your new roommate.
I-l'm moving in.

237
00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:28,629
I don't mean to be rude,
but aren't you a little old
to be starting medical school?

238
00:17:28,697 --> 00:17:31,723
You know, Babe Ruth was 39
when he joined the Yankees.

239
00:17:31,801 --> 00:17:33,735
- No, he wasn't.
- You're right.

240
00:17:33,803 --> 00:17:37,899
But I could really use
an example like that, and if
you ever find one, let me know.

241
00:17:39,742 --> 00:17:42,040
Hi. Patch Adams.

242
00:17:42,111 --> 00:17:44,545
Mitch Vroman.
Georgetown University.

243
00:17:44,613 --> 00:17:47,639
I was awarded the William F. Thompson
Scientific Achievement Award.

244
00:17:47,716 --> 00:17:49,650
Mmm. Emerson Elementary.

245
00:17:49,718 --> 00:17:53,552
I once drew a picture of a rabbit
that got me two gold stars.

246
00:17:55,724 --> 00:17:59,057
I'm gonna go
back over there now.

247
00:18:03,132 --> 00:18:06,397
First do no harm.

248
00:18:06,468 --> 00:18:10,802
What is implicit in this
simple precept of medicine?

249
00:18:11,941 --> 00:18:14,068
An awesome power.

250
00:18:14,143 --> 00:18:16,577
The power to do harm.

251
00:18:18,047 --> 00:18:20,379
Who gives you this power?

252
00:18:20,449 --> 00:18:22,542
The patient.

253
00:18:22,618 --> 00:18:25,917
A patient will come to you
at his moment of greatest dread..

254
00:18:25,988 --> 00:18:29,822
hand you a knife and say,
"Doctor, cut me open."

255
00:18:29,892 --> 00:18:31,860
Why?

256
00:18:31,927 --> 00:18:34,088
Because he trusts you.

257
00:18:34,163 --> 00:18:37,530
He trusts you
the way a child trusts.

258
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:42,560
He trusts you
to do no harm.

259
00:18:42,638 --> 00:18:45,266
The sad fact is...

260
00:18:45,341 --> 00:18:47,809
human beings
are not worthy of trust.

261
00:18:48,911 --> 00:18:50,845
It is human nature to lie...

262
00:18:50,913 --> 00:18:54,178
take shortcuts,
to lose your nerve, get tired...

263
00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:56,650
make mistakes.

264
00:18:56,719 --> 00:19:00,314
No rational patient would
put his trust in a human being...

265
00:19:00,389 --> 00:19:02,823
and were not gonna let him!

266
00:19:02,892 --> 00:19:05,019
It is our mission here...

267
00:19:05,094 --> 00:19:09,121
to rigorously and ruthlessly
train the humanity out of you...

268
00:19:09,198 --> 00:19:11,530
and make you
into something better.

269
00:19:12,902 --> 00:19:15,837
We're gonna make doctors
out of you.

270
00:19:32,521 --> 00:19:34,455
Two years of studying.

271
00:19:34,523 --> 00:19:37,458
I thought we'd have more contact
with patients. Didn't you?

272
00:19:37,526 --> 00:19:39,460
Hi. I'm Patch.

273
00:19:39,528 --> 00:19:41,962
You've just experienced
a North American greeting...

274
00:19:42,031 --> 00:19:44,465
whereby one person offers
a verbal label to another...

275
00:19:44,533 --> 00:19:46,967
as an expression
of welcome and friendship.

276
00:19:47,036 --> 00:19:49,163
Lesbian. Ball-buster.
Airhead. Leech.

277
00:19:49,238 --> 00:19:52,173
Whichever one of these disgusts
you the most, take your pick.

278
00:19:52,241 --> 00:19:54,175
- Well--
- Please pass the word.

279
00:19:54,243 --> 00:19:57,679
I am not here to date. I am not
here to flirt. I'm here to study.

280
00:19:59,748 --> 00:20:01,682
Thank you.

281
00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:05,186
I thought only I could repel women
with that kind of raw efficiency.

282
00:20:05,254 --> 00:20:08,018
Well, you just met your match.

283
00:20:08,090 --> 00:20:10,354
- Patch Adams.
- Truman Schiff.

284
00:20:10,426 --> 00:20:12,860
Nice to meet you, Truman.

285
00:20:12,928 --> 00:20:15,021
Will you go out with me?

286
00:20:18,867 --> 00:20:21,495
May I ask you one question?

287
00:20:21,570 --> 00:20:25,062
- Do you buy everything
the dean was saying today?
- What do you mean?

288
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:27,574
I mean, that whole
drill sergeant thing.

289
00:20:27,643 --> 00:20:30,874
"We're gon' make doctors
out of you medical scum.

290
00:20:30,946 --> 00:20:33,380
- Now drop down and give me 20."
- Mm-hmm.

291
00:20:33,449 --> 00:20:35,007
That whole marine thing.

292
00:20:35,084 --> 00:20:38,019
We're not even gonna see
a patient until the third year.

293
00:20:38,087 --> 00:20:40,021
Up until then,
it's just memorizing facts.

294
00:20:40,089 --> 00:20:42,023
-Why don't they just shove the book up--
-Hamburger?

295
00:20:42,091 --> 00:20:46,118
Right here on the colon. That's where
it's going anyway. Thanks very much.

296
00:20:46,195 --> 00:20:48,891
- So, why do you wanna be a doctor?
- I want to help.

297
00:20:48,964 --> 00:20:53,025
I want to connect with people.
A doctor interacts with people
at their most vulnerable.

298
00:20:53,102 --> 00:20:56,367
He offers treatment,
but he also offers counsel and hope.

299
00:20:56,438 --> 00:20:59,373
That's why I love the idea
of being a doctor.

300
00:20:59,441 --> 00:21:02,706
I've always been fascinated by
the development of the human mind.

301
00:21:02,778 --> 00:21:04,939
Ah. Pumping neurons.

302
00:21:05,014 --> 00:21:07,448
We start out so open
and spontaneous.

303
00:21:07,516 --> 00:21:10,952
We're real individuals. Then somewhere
along the way we're drawn to conform.

304
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:14,615
- It's as if we're conditioned
by programmed responses.
- Well, that's true.

305
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:17,625
But sometimes you can alter
the programmed response...

306
00:21:17,693 --> 00:21:21,823
just by changing some of the conditions,
altering the parameters.

307
00:21:21,897 --> 00:21:23,797
Let me show you.

308
00:21:24,967 --> 00:21:26,901
We'll call it
the "hello" experiment.

309
00:21:26,969 --> 00:21:29,403
The goal will be to break through
programmed response...

310
00:21:29,471 --> 00:21:31,405
by changing normal parameters...

311
00:21:31,473 --> 00:21:33,270
and getting a new emotional response
from the person.

312
00:21:33,342 --> 00:21:35,276
Ready to enter data.

313
00:21:37,079 --> 00:21:39,013
Hello.

314
00:21:39,081 --> 00:21:41,345
Hi.

315
00:21:45,287 --> 00:21:47,221
Wait.
I don't get it.

316
00:21:47,289 --> 00:21:49,416
"Hi" is a programmed response.

317
00:21:49,491 --> 00:21:52,051
- I reached her.
- You scared her.

318
00:21:52,127 --> 00:21:55,290
No. Wait.
Wait for it.

319
00:21:56,498 --> 00:21:58,932
Oh, you're nuts.

320
00:21:59,001 --> 00:22:01,526
A smile.

321
00:22:01,603 --> 00:22:04,197
Ten seconds.
Victory.

322
00:22:04,273 --> 00:22:06,537
There's more.
Come, my friend.

323
00:22:08,143 --> 00:22:10,077
- Howdy!
- Hi.

324
00:22:10,145 --> 00:22:12,079
See?
Response time is diminishing.

325
00:22:12,147 --> 00:22:14,581
Yesterday I made
12 random phone calls.

326
00:22:14,650 --> 00:22:18,086
I talked to one man named Dale for
three hours. He told me amazing things.

327
00:22:18,153 --> 00:22:21,088
But what does this all prove,
other than you're out of your mind?

328
00:22:21,156 --> 00:22:24,091
What's the difference between
a doctor and a scientist?

329
00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:26,093
And don't say salary.

330
00:22:26,161 --> 00:22:29,597
People. Hmm? We want to become doctors
because we want to help people.

331
00:22:29,665 --> 00:22:31,599
I want to be
a pediatrician.

332
00:22:31,667 --> 00:22:33,601
Okay, little people.

333
00:22:33,669 --> 00:22:37,105
The point is, we have to treat
the patient as well as the disease.

334
00:22:37,172 --> 00:22:42,269
That's why we have to dive into people,
wade into the sea of humanity, Truman.

335
00:22:42,344 --> 00:22:44,904
Ballroom seven,
right upstairs on your left.

336
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:48,916
- You guys with
the meat packers convention?
- Yes, sir!

337
00:22:48,984 --> 00:22:50,918
Right up the stairs.
Ballroom seven.

338
00:22:50,986 --> 00:22:53,921
- Hey! Does a chicken have lips?
- You'll find out upstairs!

339
00:22:53,989 --> 00:22:56,514
Like a bulldog
on a pork chop!

340
00:23:08,103 --> 00:23:11,038
You know, in New Zealand
they found a whole new use for sheep.

341
00:23:11,106 --> 00:23:13,040
- What's that?
- Wool!

342
00:23:14,309 --> 00:23:17,244
You're funny!
You kill me! You kill me!

343
00:23:17,312 --> 00:23:19,246
- I love you!
- Oh, daddy!

344
00:23:19,314 --> 00:23:22,249
And you-- I bet you've heard that too!
Come here! Ha ha!

345
00:23:22,317 --> 00:23:24,979
- "Herd" it? That's a goat joke!
- Ohh!

346
00:23:34,496 --> 00:23:36,430
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

347
00:23:39,201 --> 00:23:41,396
On your meat!

348
00:23:41,470 --> 00:23:43,904
Get set! Go!

349
00:23:45,874 --> 00:23:49,071
Ohh! Yeah!

350
00:23:50,145 --> 00:23:52,443
I won!

351
00:23:55,450 --> 00:23:59,113
Pork packers,
rump wrappers, bull shippers,

352
00:23:59,188 --> 00:24:02,055
Iend me your steers!

353
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:10,457
You know, we packers have been
taking a bad rap for years.

354
00:24:10,532 --> 00:24:12,966
Yeah!

355
00:24:13,035 --> 00:24:17,165
Because we all want to be
the best damn packers there are!

356
00:24:17,239 --> 00:24:20,265
- Yeah!
- Yeah!
- I'm proud of my meat!

357
00:24:20,342 --> 00:24:22,833
- And I know you're proud of your meat!
- Yeah!

358
00:24:22,911 --> 00:24:25,812
- Whip it, zip it and send it out!
- Yeah!

359
00:24:27,883 --> 00:24:29,976
You know,
some people say chicken.

360
00:24:30,052 --> 00:24:31,246
- No!
- No!

361
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:33,618
- Some people say fish.
- No!

362
00:24:33,689 --> 00:24:38,285
I say,
now is the time for cow!

363
00:24:40,362 --> 00:24:43,195
Eat cow! Eat cow! Eat cow! Eat cow!

364
00:24:43,265 --> 00:24:47,497
Eat cow! Eat cow!
Eat cow! Eat cow! Eat cow!

365
00:24:47,569 --> 00:24:51,300
Eat cow! Eat cow!
Eat cow! Eat cow! Eat cow!

366
00:24:51,373 --> 00:24:53,341
Hey, bud.

367
00:24:53,408 --> 00:24:55,603
- Hey!
- Oh!

368
00:24:55,677 --> 00:24:58,771
Yes, thanks.
Oh, yeah.

369
00:24:58,847 --> 00:25:02,283
Hey-- Whoa!

370
00:25:02,351 --> 00:25:04,285
What is it?

371
00:25:04,353 --> 00:25:08,541
What's the difference
between a first-year
and a third-year medical student?

372
00:25:13,513 --> 00:25:17,950
Doctor Vukov, please dial line 1242.

373
00:25:18,017 --> 00:25:21,783
Dr. Vukov,
please dial line 1242.

374
00:25:24,023 --> 00:25:26,457
Here we have
a juvenile onset diabetic...

375
00:25:26,526 --> 00:25:29,689
with poor circulation
and diabetic neuropathy.

376
00:25:29,763 --> 00:25:32,698
As you can see,
these are diabetic ulcers...

377
00:25:32,766 --> 00:25:34,961
with lymphedema
and evidence of gangrene.

378
00:25:35,034 --> 00:25:36,968
Questions?

379
00:25:37,036 --> 00:25:39,664
- Any osteomyelitis?
- None apparent.

380
00:25:39,739 --> 00:25:41,297
Although not definitive.

381
00:25:41,374 --> 00:25:43,501
- Treatment?
- To stabilize the blood sugar.

382
00:25:43,576 --> 00:25:46,306
Consider antibiotics,
possibly amputation.

383
00:25:46,379 --> 00:25:48,472
What's her name?

384
00:25:52,719 --> 00:25:55,688
I was just wondering
the patient's name.

385
00:25:57,690 --> 00:25:59,624
Marjorie.

386
00:26:00,994 --> 00:26:02,621
Hi, Marjorie.

387
00:26:02,695 --> 00:26:04,322
Hi.

388
00:26:05,432 --> 00:26:07,957
Yes, um, thank you.

389
00:26:08,034 --> 00:26:09,968
Let's move on.

390
00:26:12,372 --> 00:26:15,307
- What are you doing?
- Continuing the experiment. Come on.

391
00:26:15,375 --> 00:26:18,310
We can start a lemonade stand
together after we get kicked out
of medical school.

392
00:26:18,378 --> 00:26:20,073
Bye, Marjorie.

393
00:26:20,146 --> 00:26:23,081
I cannot stand it in there, Joletta.

394
00:26:23,149 --> 00:26:26,084
He doesn't have
to talk to me like that.

395
00:26:26,152 --> 00:26:29,588
I know, hon, but really,
how good a mood would you be in?

396
00:26:30,723 --> 00:26:34,022
- May I help you?
- Oh, um--

397
00:26:34,093 --> 00:26:37,028
So I'll meet you
at the club.

398
00:26:37,096 --> 00:26:40,691
Oh, great.
Maybe we'll play the back nine, hmm?

399
00:26:42,168 --> 00:26:45,103
Hello. I'm Patch.

400
00:26:45,171 --> 00:26:47,105
I'm studying medicine here.

401
00:26:47,173 --> 00:26:51,234
Well, not here, but--
Y-You know.

402
00:26:51,311 --> 00:26:54,109
Lookit here, Judy.
Another future boss.

403
00:26:54,180 --> 00:26:56,239
Oh, I wouldn't
look at it like that.

404
00:26:56,316 --> 00:26:58,250
You may think
I'm exaggeratin'...

405
00:26:58,318 --> 00:27:01,185
but in another five years
you'll be so full of yourself...

406
00:27:01,254 --> 00:27:04,849
you'll have to hang a cup out your ass
just to catch the excess.

407
00:27:04,924 --> 00:27:07,392
- Joletta!
- Ouch.
- Well, hell, why not?

408
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:10,395
It's the only time in my life
I'm gonna outrank him.

409
00:27:10,463 --> 00:27:12,931
Might as well enjoy it.

410
00:27:12,999 --> 00:27:16,992
- Who's in that room?
- Don't even think about it.
He'll bite your head off.

411
00:27:17,070 --> 00:27:19,265
Mr. Davis.
Pancreatic cancer.

412
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:22,374
How long does he have?

413
00:27:22,442 --> 00:27:25,377
Longer than you,
if you go in that room.

414
00:27:25,445 --> 00:27:27,538
So be sure
you steer clear.

415
00:27:27,614 --> 00:27:30,208
Yes, ma'am.
Thank you.

416
00:27:33,019 --> 00:27:35,385
Hey!
What year are you?

417
00:27:40,693 --> 00:27:42,627
- Hi.
- Hey.

418
00:27:51,371 --> 00:27:54,238
Dr. Landaker to Administration.

419
00:27:54,307 --> 00:27:56,741
Dr. Landaker
to Administration, please.

420
00:28:26,072 --> 00:28:28,006
Hi.

421
00:28:28,074 --> 00:28:29,939
Hi.

422
00:28:30,009 --> 00:28:32,705
- What's your name?
- Cameron.

423
00:28:32,779 --> 00:28:36,044
Hi, Cameron.
I'm Patch.

424
00:28:57,203 --> 00:29:00,536
I have a cold. Just a bit of a cold.

425
00:29:00,607 --> 00:29:04,373
Is my nose red?
Oh, it is. It's red.

426
00:29:06,079 --> 00:29:09,071
Ohh! Oh.

427
00:29:09,148 --> 00:29:11,378
What's that?
You don't know?

428
00:29:11,451 --> 00:29:13,385
I don't either.
Let's find out.

429
00:29:14,954 --> 00:29:16,888
Taxi!

430
00:29:16,956 --> 00:29:19,891
Try on you.
Give it to me.

431
00:29:22,729 --> 00:29:25,664
It's working very well.

432
00:29:25,732 --> 00:29:27,859
Let's see what else we have.

433
00:29:27,934 --> 00:29:30,164
Look at some of this stuff.

434
00:29:40,947 --> 00:29:43,609
Bee kisses.

435
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:55,694
Hi.

436
00:29:55,762 --> 00:29:57,696
- Hi.
- You mind if I sit down?

437
00:30:23,690 --> 00:30:27,626
Hah? Well, then,
hello, hello.

438
00:30:27,694 --> 00:30:29,218
Oh, look at--

439
00:30:42,075 --> 00:30:45,067
Yee-haah!
Yee-haah!

440
00:30:45,144 --> 00:30:49,171
Whoa! Whoa!
Yee-haah!

441
00:30:49,248 --> 00:30:51,842
Come on, buddy!
Whee-haah!

442
00:30:53,086 --> 00:30:55,680
What is going on here?

443
00:31:09,302 --> 00:31:11,862
Sit down.

444
00:31:11,938 --> 00:31:15,465
Get in your beds right now.

445
00:31:15,541 --> 00:31:17,509
Sit down! Sit down!

446
00:31:19,712 --> 00:31:23,011
Lie down in your beds
right now!

447
00:31:23,082 --> 00:31:26,347
- I've checked up on you, Hunter.
- Patch.

448
00:31:26,419 --> 00:31:29,354
Hunter, Dr. Prack was
a colleague of mine at Bringham.

449
00:31:29,422 --> 00:31:31,856
He tells me
you have a brilliant mind...

450
00:31:31,924 --> 00:31:36,452
and, like many brilliant people,
you don't necessarily think
the rules apply to you.

451
00:31:36,529 --> 00:31:39,965
Not all the rules, sir, but the Golden
Rule, I think that applies to everyone.

452
00:31:40,032 --> 00:31:41,966
Don't you, sir?

453
00:31:42,034 --> 00:31:46,198
I've also heard you have
a real passion to be a doctor, Hunter.

454
00:31:46,272 --> 00:31:48,206
Patch.

455
00:31:48,274 --> 00:31:52,176
Truth of it is, Hunter,
passion doesn't make doctors.

456
00:31:52,245 --> 00:31:54,645
I make doctors.

457
00:31:54,714 --> 00:31:56,648
Understood?

458
00:31:56,716 --> 00:31:59,207
- Understood.
- Good.

459
00:31:59,285 --> 00:32:04,077
Medical students, as a rule,
have no contact with patients
until the third year.

460
00:32:04,478 --> 00:32:06,002
- Is that clear?
- It is, sir, but don't you think--

461
00:32:06,079 --> 00:32:10,516
Our way of doing things
is a product of centuries of experience.

462
00:32:12,019 --> 00:32:13,953
It's all there for a reason.

463
00:32:17,524 --> 00:32:19,958
It's my hospital.

464
00:32:20,027 --> 00:32:22,962
I know everything
that goes on inside of it.

465
00:32:24,698 --> 00:32:26,632
Everything.

466
00:32:28,568 --> 00:32:30,502
Deviation of the tongue.

467
00:32:30,570 --> 00:32:32,538
- A problem with the cranial nerve.
- Which side?

468
00:32:32,606 --> 00:32:35,040
- Right side, tenth nerve.
- Twelfth nerve.

469
00:32:35,108 --> 00:32:38,043
Do you know how many billions of dollars
are wasted on malpractice insurance?

470
00:32:38,111 --> 00:32:41,046
That's money that goes to lawyers
that could go to patients.

471
00:32:41,114 --> 00:32:45,210
- Hi, guys. Sorry I'm late.
- Everybody know Carin Fisher,
Adelane's roommate?

472
00:32:45,285 --> 00:32:48,220
I invited her to join
our study group.

473
00:32:50,390 --> 00:32:53,325
So, Carin, why do you
want to be a doctor?

474
00:32:53,393 --> 00:32:56,328
Is it just me, or do we
have a lot of work to do?

475
00:32:56,396 --> 00:32:58,921
It's just a question.
I think it's the question.

476
00:32:58,999 --> 00:33:01,661
Actually, I don't find the question
here in the outline.

477
00:33:01,735 --> 00:33:04,067
- What page are you on?
- Uh, 1432.

478
00:33:04,137 --> 00:33:05,900
Deviation of a tongue.

479
00:33:05,973 --> 00:33:08,533
We'd learn more if we were
working closely with patients.

480
00:33:08,608 --> 00:33:11,702
That's why we're studying--
to learn enough to help the patients.

481
00:33:11,778 --> 00:33:14,212
Adelane, don't waste your breath.

482
00:33:14,281 --> 00:33:16,215
Don't you th--

483
00:33:16,283 --> 00:33:18,615
Don't you think
I see through you?

484
00:33:18,685 --> 00:33:21,620
You act like you're above the system
when you're really just a nonconformist.

485
00:33:21,688 --> 00:33:23,622
You have to get
under the fingernails...

486
00:33:23,690 --> 00:33:26,124
of any authority figure
that crosses your path...

487
00:33:26,193 --> 00:33:28,423
as a way of dealing
with some insecurity.

488
00:33:28,495 --> 00:33:30,429
Antisocial personality, I believe.
Intriguing diagnosis.

489
00:33:30,497 --> 00:33:34,126
Truman, this isn't funny. Smart people
flunk out of here all the time.

490
00:33:34,201 --> 00:33:38,604
Yeah, uh, odds are one of
the five of us sitting here, actually.

491
00:33:38,672 --> 00:33:40,606
I have another question.

492
00:33:40,674 --> 00:33:42,608
In a perfect system...

493
00:33:42,676 --> 00:33:45,110
why are patients referred to
by their disease...

494
00:33:45,178 --> 00:33:48,113
as in "that interesting
cancer patient,"
and not by their name?

495
00:33:48,181 --> 00:33:51,275
- It certainly isn't to be mean.
It's to prevent transference.
- And why is that bad?

496
00:33:51,351 --> 00:33:54,752
- And the one flunking out is?
- Can we get back to the tongue?

497
00:33:54,821 --> 00:33:57,756
What if a doctor becomes
emotionally involved with a patient?

498
00:33:57,824 --> 00:33:59,758
Does a doctor explode?
No.

499
00:33:59,826 --> 00:34:01,691
Who came up
with these rules?

500
00:34:01,762 --> 00:34:03,696
It's against the Hippocratic oath,
I think.

501
00:34:03,764 --> 00:34:06,699
I don't really have time for this.
Sorry.

502
00:34:08,301 --> 00:34:10,064
Bye.

503
00:34:10,137 --> 00:34:12,071
- Bye.
- Sorry.

504
00:34:12,139 --> 00:34:14,300
- Charming.
- Bye.

505
00:34:14,374 --> 00:34:16,308
- Truman?
- Yeah.

506
00:34:16,376 --> 00:34:20,312
- I'm sorry. I didn't mean
to stop you from studying.
- Go away!

507
00:34:20,380 --> 00:34:23,816
I believe there's more to being
a doctor than memorizing facts
about the ventricular artery.

508
00:34:23,884 --> 00:34:26,819
I don't care what you think.
I care about my biology test.

509
00:34:26,887 --> 00:34:29,822
- Maybe I could help you.
I read the bio book.
- The whole book?

510
00:34:29,890 --> 00:34:31,824
Oh, yeah.
Now I'm on to Whitman.

511
00:34:31,892 --> 00:34:35,328
You can get Leaves of Grass
at the bookstore if you have
a 20% student l.D. card.

512
00:34:35,395 --> 00:34:38,592
- I don't want Walt Whitman.
- He wouldn't want you either.
He was a homosexual.

513
00:34:38,665 --> 00:34:41,463
But that's not relevant. What's relevant
is that he was a medical man.

514
00:34:41,535 --> 00:34:44,333
He was a nurse in the Civil War
and wrote great poetry.

515
00:34:44,404 --> 00:34:46,964
"Afoot and lighthearted,
I take to the open road--"

516
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:49,975
Look, I'm not sure
if you've noticed this...

517
00:34:50,043 --> 00:34:54,639
but in a class of 163 students
there are eight women-- eight.

518
00:34:54,714 --> 00:34:58,650
I've had to work really hard
to get here, and I'm gonna have
to work even harder to stay...

519
00:34:58,718 --> 00:35:02,552
and I'm not about to blow it
by wasting my time on your
flighty theories of goodness.

520
00:35:02,622 --> 00:35:05,853
I'm here to learn about medicine.
Period.

521
00:35:05,926 --> 00:35:07,860
Excuse me.

522
00:35:09,362 --> 00:35:12,297
I think somebody is
running away from something.

523
00:35:12,365 --> 00:35:15,823
Why can't it just be that
I'm running away from you?

524
00:35:35,722 --> 00:35:37,155
Hi.

525
00:35:41,394 --> 00:35:44,261
Very nice. Very nice.

526
00:35:48,869 --> 00:35:50,860
Do I look thin to you?

527
00:35:50,937 --> 00:35:53,872
'Cause I'm tryin' to lose
a little weight.

528
00:35:53,940 --> 00:35:55,908
Is this too much?
Have I gone too far?

529
00:35:55,976 --> 00:35:58,308
I got a boner.

530
00:35:58,378 --> 00:36:00,107
I am a boner.

531
00:36:10,924 --> 00:36:13,358
Donner, party of 50!

532
00:36:13,426 --> 00:36:16,953
Donner! Donner party! Over here!

533
00:36:17,030 --> 00:36:19,464
I don't know what's wrong here.

534
00:36:19,533 --> 00:36:23,367
I'm tryin' to light
the dials here, but, uh...

535
00:36:23,436 --> 00:36:26,428
bottom line is,
your TV's broken here.

536
00:36:28,642 --> 00:36:32,043
My name is
Officer Patty O'Furniture.

537
00:36:32,112 --> 00:36:35,047
I'm here today to talk to you
briefly about narcolepsy.

538
00:36:35,115 --> 00:36:37,583
Narcolepsy--

539
00:36:37,651 --> 00:36:38,982
Clown salute!

540
00:36:39,052 --> 00:36:42,146
Very good!

541
00:36:42,222 --> 00:36:43,814
Wide face!

542
00:36:45,158 --> 00:36:47,126
Fart face!

543
00:36:48,862 --> 00:36:52,298
The hospital will cover
all of your bills.

544
00:36:52,365 --> 00:36:54,299
Any other questions?

545
00:36:54,367 --> 00:36:57,768
My name is Doctor... Phil.

546
00:36:57,837 --> 00:37:00,829
I'll be your surgeon--
Oh, there you are.

547
00:37:00,907 --> 00:37:04,502
Ha ha ha! Hey!
Let's get ready to party!

548
00:37:08,148 --> 00:37:11,481
Grazie! Hey! Grazie!

549
00:37:11,551 --> 00:37:13,519
- Grazie! Now take a bow!

550
00:37:36,676 --> 00:37:39,110
Don't believe
everything you read.

551
00:37:39,179 --> 00:37:42,376
Looks like you didn't need
that study group after all.

552
00:37:42,449 --> 00:37:45,384
Well, it's no 98,
but I'm still here.

553
00:37:45,452 --> 00:37:47,386
Yeah.

554
00:37:47,454 --> 00:37:50,014
- Excuse me.
- Oh, excuse me. Excuse me.

555
00:37:50,090 --> 00:37:51,819
Excuse me.

556
00:37:54,327 --> 00:37:57,763
- You know, this completely
disrupts my point of view.
- Mm-hmm.

557
00:37:57,831 --> 00:38:00,698
It was so much more convenient
thinking of you as an idiot.

558
00:38:00,767 --> 00:38:03,201
- Don't count me out yet.
- It's frustrating.

559
00:38:03,270 --> 00:38:06,637
I study all night, and I'm barely
hanging on by my fingernails.

560
00:38:06,706 --> 00:38:09,641
Oh, forget about that. I want to
show you something that's extraordinary.

561
00:38:11,711 --> 00:38:14,043
- An enema bulb?
- It used to be.

562
00:38:14,114 --> 00:38:16,548
This amazing piece of rubber...

563
00:38:16,616 --> 00:38:18,846
when applied to your face...

564
00:38:18,918 --> 00:38:21,011
can brighten
another person's day.

565
00:38:22,088 --> 00:38:24,522
Even a suffering patient.

566
00:38:24,591 --> 00:38:28,027
- I'm sure it's really great
for kids, but--
- No, not just kids. Anybody.

567
00:38:28,094 --> 00:38:30,028
Patients are opening up
to me, Carin.

568
00:38:30,096 --> 00:38:32,030
They're sharing their dreams,
their fantasies...

569
00:38:32,098 --> 00:38:34,532
and if you hit on
the right topic...

570
00:38:34,601 --> 00:38:36,865
they brighten up
for one brief moment.

571
00:38:36,936 --> 00:38:38,870
They don't concentrate
on the pain.

572
00:38:38,938 --> 00:38:42,066
They don't even feel the pain.

573
00:38:42,142 --> 00:38:44,076
- Try it on.
- No, thank you.

574
00:38:44,144 --> 00:38:47,409
I want you to try it on and help me.
Just try it on.

575
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:50,415
If you don't laugh,
you'll never see it again.

576
00:38:50,483 --> 00:38:53,452
But if you do,
you have to help me.

577
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:55,454
Just try it on.

578
00:38:59,326 --> 00:39:01,191
Hmm.

579
00:39:02,629 --> 00:39:05,462
You didn't say anything about a mirror.

580
00:39:07,167 --> 00:39:09,761
Who do you think
you look like?

581
00:39:11,004 --> 00:39:12,801
Karl Malden?

582
00:39:15,175 --> 00:39:17,700
You cheated.

583
00:39:18,945 --> 00:39:20,913
You can take the nose off now.

584
00:39:22,182 --> 00:39:24,116
So, what's the favor?

585
00:39:54,481 --> 00:39:56,415
Psst.

586
00:39:57,717 --> 00:39:59,184
Ready?

587
00:40:05,692 --> 00:40:07,819
Dumbo incoming!

588
00:40:11,598 --> 00:40:14,533
Bag 'im, Bwana!

589
00:40:16,936 --> 00:40:19,029
Killer poodle! You got lucky!

590
00:40:19,105 --> 00:40:22,040
Piranha fish!
Yea! Very good!

591
00:40:22,108 --> 00:40:24,975
Man down!

592
00:40:27,380 --> 00:40:29,575
- What was that?
- It's nothing.

593
00:40:29,649 --> 00:40:31,583
Should I go check?

594
00:40:31,651 --> 00:40:33,585
I said, it's nothin'.

595
00:40:39,092 --> 00:40:41,060
One last one!

596
00:40:41,127 --> 00:40:43,357
Oww!

597
00:40:47,967 --> 00:40:51,403
Well, congratulations, Jackie.

598
00:40:51,471 --> 00:40:54,702
You've done it all. You've nailed
every balloon from here to Timbuktu.

599
00:40:56,776 --> 00:40:59,711
That was incredible, Patch.

600
00:40:59,779 --> 00:41:01,747
Almost as good
as the real thing.

601
00:41:04,150 --> 00:41:06,584
One last safari.

602
00:41:06,653 --> 00:41:08,587
That's all I wanted.

603
00:41:10,290 --> 00:41:13,987
Thank you, Truman.
Both of you.

604
00:41:14,060 --> 00:41:15,994
That was wonderful.

605
00:41:16,062 --> 00:41:19,498
Yes, it's been
a long time for me.

606
00:41:19,566 --> 00:41:22,729
What about you, dear?
What's your fantasy?

607
00:41:22,802 --> 00:41:24,895
Oh.

608
00:41:24,971 --> 00:41:26,905
When I was a little girl...

609
00:41:26,973 --> 00:41:31,273
whenever my mother
would cook spaghetti...

610
00:41:31,344 --> 00:41:36,714
she would let me reach into the pot
and squeeze the noodles.

611
00:41:36,783 --> 00:41:38,512
Oh!

612
00:41:39,652 --> 00:41:41,847
I've always wanted...

613
00:41:41,921 --> 00:41:45,584
to be in a swimming pool
full of noodles...

614
00:41:45,658 --> 00:41:49,094
wall-to-wall
and top-to-bottom.

615
00:41:49,162 --> 00:41:54,099
An entire pool
full of noodles.

616
00:41:55,468 --> 00:41:57,732
Oh.

617
00:41:57,804 --> 00:41:59,738
How about a poodle?

618
00:42:01,274 --> 00:42:04,710
And the award for valor goes to
Truman Schiff and his red welt.

619
00:42:04,777 --> 00:42:08,713
- Thank you, Truman.
- Located just above my
nasal bone, adjacent to my--

620
00:42:08,781 --> 00:42:10,715
- Glabella!
- Whoo!
- Glabella!

621
00:42:10,783 --> 00:42:12,774
Good night, Truman.

622
00:42:14,454 --> 00:42:16,388
Right.

623
00:42:16,456 --> 00:42:19,391
Fun's fun, kids, but my welt
and I have a study date...

624
00:42:19,459 --> 00:42:21,893
with the autonomic nerves
of the thorax.

625
00:42:21,961 --> 00:42:24,896
- Good luck. Watch out
for the circle of Willis.
- Good luck to you.

626
00:42:24,964 --> 00:42:27,899
And our next award, in the tradition
of the great poodle handlers...

627
00:42:27,967 --> 00:42:29,901
where no actual transference
took place--

628
00:42:29,969 --> 00:42:34,133
All right. What you did in there,
it was very nice, I admit.

629
00:42:34,207 --> 00:42:37,142
Whoa. Is that a little ice
that just chipped off?

630
00:42:37,210 --> 00:42:40,145
- You're never serious, are you?
- No. I tried that for years.

631
00:42:40,213 --> 00:42:42,647
Never really worked for me.

632
00:42:42,715 --> 00:42:44,649
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

633
00:42:44,717 --> 00:42:46,651
Oh.

634
00:42:46,719 --> 00:42:49,654
Well, I'd better go hit
the thorax as well, so--

635
00:42:49,722 --> 00:42:51,656
I have a crush on you.

636
00:42:51,724 --> 00:42:55,711
Ha! I can't believe I just
blurted that out.

637
00:42:55,845 --> 00:42:59,144
Look, thank you for
taking me along tonight.

638
00:42:59,215 --> 00:43:01,775
I actually had fun.

639
00:43:01,851 --> 00:43:03,478
Good night.

640
00:43:03,553 --> 00:43:05,214
Wait a minute.

641
00:43:05,288 --> 00:43:08,451
When I said I had a crush on you,
you didn't say...

642
00:43:08,524 --> 00:43:11,049
"No way, loser.
I'd rather have a lobotomy by a leper."

643
00:43:11,127 --> 00:43:12,719
That means something.

644
00:43:12,795 --> 00:43:16,754
Maybe I was just being polite
and I didn't want to hurt your feelings.

645
00:43:16,832 --> 00:43:19,130
But you're not polite.
You're rude.

646
00:43:19,201 --> 00:43:21,135
Sometimes you're downright bitchy.

647
00:43:22,371 --> 00:43:24,305
- Good night.
- Good night.

648
00:43:39,555 --> 00:43:42,991
Dr. Hyer, please dial the pharmacy.

649
00:44:08,584 --> 00:44:10,848
Blue skies

650
00:44:10,920 --> 00:44:13,184
Shining on me

651
00:44:13,255 --> 00:44:15,883
Nothin' but blue skies

652
00:44:15,958 --> 00:44:18,449
Do I see

653
00:44:18,527 --> 00:44:20,461
Bluebirds

654
00:44:20,529 --> 00:44:22,156
Singin' a song

655
00:44:22,231 --> 00:44:25,428
- Are you a doctor?
- No. I'm a medical student.

656
00:44:25,501 --> 00:44:28,937
But if there's anything
I can do to help you--

657
00:44:29,005 --> 00:44:31,940
- You wanna help me?
- Oh, yeah. What can I do?

658
00:44:32,008 --> 00:44:33,942
Listen, you little
do-gooder prick.

659
00:44:34,010 --> 00:44:36,945
If you wanna make yourself feel good,
don't make me pay for it.

660
00:44:37,013 --> 00:44:39,504
Now get out of here,
'cause you don't help shit!

661
00:45:02,638 --> 00:45:05,402
Dr. Maslow, line 214, please.

662
00:45:05,474 --> 00:45:07,908
Dr. Maslow, line 214.

663
00:45:09,845 --> 00:45:12,939
Yo! Ride 'em, cowboy!
Whoo-hoo!

664
00:45:13,015 --> 00:45:16,212
Yea!

665
00:45:18,788 --> 00:45:21,916
Oh! Oh! I surrender!
I'll tell you what you want to know!

666
00:45:21,991 --> 00:45:24,926
Do you wanna tell me what it is
you think you're doing?

667
00:45:26,395 --> 00:45:27,862
Oh.

668
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:33,234
Uh...

669
00:45:33,302 --> 00:45:35,236
just getting
a few laughs, sir.

670
00:45:37,039 --> 00:45:39,974
The American Journal of Medicine
has found that laughter...

671
00:45:40,042 --> 00:45:42,067
increases secretion
of catecholamines and endorphins...

672
00:45:42,144 --> 00:45:44,408
which in turn increases oxygenation
of the blood, relaxes the arteries...

673
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:47,415
speeds up the heart,
decreases blood pressure...

674
00:45:47,483 --> 00:45:50,418
which has a positive effect
on all cardiovascular
and respiratory ailments...

675
00:45:50,486 --> 00:45:53,580
as well as overall increasing
the immune system response.

676
00:46:01,397 --> 00:46:03,126
Smart clown, eh?

677
00:46:08,003 --> 00:46:09,903
Mr. Adams.

678
00:46:09,972 --> 00:46:12,907
When I told you
I knew Dr. Prack...

679
00:46:12,975 --> 00:46:16,911
did I mislead you in some way
to think I'm a pushover, like he is?

680
00:46:16,979 --> 00:46:19,413
Kindly remove that coat.

681
00:46:19,482 --> 00:46:23,350
I told you you are not to see
the patients till the third year.

682
00:46:23,419 --> 00:46:25,353
I'm just visiting friends, sir.

683
00:46:25,421 --> 00:46:27,355
Why are you here?

684
00:46:27,423 --> 00:46:30,358
If you want to be a clown,
go join the circus.

685
00:46:30,426 --> 00:46:33,361
Patients don't need to be entertained.
They don't need a friend.

686
00:46:33,429 --> 00:46:36,364
They need a doctor.

687
00:46:36,432 --> 00:46:39,401
I don't want to see you
in this hospital again.

688
00:46:39,468 --> 00:46:43,165
What if I visit the patients
on my own time?

689
00:46:43,239 --> 00:46:46,174
Yes, about your own time.

690
00:46:46,242 --> 00:46:49,473
It's been brought to our attention
that perhaps we should be suspicious...

691
00:46:49,545 --> 00:46:51,479
of the level
of your grades.

692
00:46:51,547 --> 00:46:53,447
What are you saying?
I'm cheating?

693
00:46:53,516 --> 00:46:57,179
Your scores are among the top in
your class, yet you never seem to study.

694
00:46:57,253 --> 00:46:59,221
That's ridiculous.

695
00:46:59,288 --> 00:47:01,688
Your classmates
don't seem to think so.

696
00:47:01,757 --> 00:47:04,157
Really. Who?

697
00:47:04,226 --> 00:47:08,322
I'm warning you.
Stay out of this hospital.

698
00:47:19,642 --> 00:47:21,576
You told Walcott I cheated.

699
00:47:21,644 --> 00:47:24,579
I know you did it.
Just tell me why.

700
00:47:24,647 --> 00:47:26,581
Look, cut the crap, Hunter.

701
00:47:26,649 --> 00:47:29,584
I live with you. I know how much
you study, or don't study.

702
00:47:29,652 --> 00:47:33,213
And you do better than me?
Give me a break.

703
00:47:33,289 --> 00:47:38,226
You arrogant, pompous prick!
Who appointed you custodian
of the medical profession?

704
00:47:38,294 --> 00:47:42,162
Is it because your father
and his father was a doctor,
some sort of genetic thing?

705
00:47:42,231 --> 00:47:44,324
- You're damn right.
- Really?

706
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:46,334
I grew up with it.

707
00:47:46,402 --> 00:47:49,860
I know what it takes to look in the eyes
of dying people day after day...

708
00:47:49,939 --> 00:47:51,873
and come home
for dinner at night.

709
00:47:51,941 --> 00:47:55,206
- I know what it takes.
You don't have it.
- Oh, really. And you do?

710
00:47:55,277 --> 00:47:58,007
If you don't like me,
just say it.

711
00:47:58,080 --> 00:48:00,173
I don't like you!

712
00:48:00,249 --> 00:48:03,582
Why don't you like me?
You're a prick, and I like you.

713
00:48:03,652 --> 00:48:05,779
Because you make
my effort a joke!

714
00:48:05,855 --> 00:48:09,188
I want to be a doctor!
This isn't a game to me!

715
00:48:09,258 --> 00:48:11,453
This isn't playtime!

716
00:48:11,527 --> 00:48:14,291
This is serious business!

717
00:48:14,363 --> 00:48:17,924
I have it in me
to be a great doctor...

718
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:21,697
but in order to do that I have to
sacrifice if I want to be better.

719
00:48:21,770 --> 00:48:23,704
"Better."
Better than me, hmm?

720
00:48:23,772 --> 00:48:26,707
I will save lives that
could have otherwise not been saved.

721
00:48:26,775 --> 00:48:30,211
Now, I could be like you and go around
laughing and have a good time, ha ha...

722
00:48:30,279 --> 00:48:33,214
but I prefer to learn,
because the more I learn...

723
00:48:33,282 --> 00:48:36,479
the more likely I will
have the right answer at the
crucial moment and save a life.

724
00:48:36,552 --> 00:48:39,282
And you say I'm a prick?
You say I'm a prick?

725
00:48:39,355 --> 00:48:41,289
You know, maybe I am...

726
00:48:41,357 --> 00:48:44,292
but you ask the average person, when
death comes knocking at their door...

727
00:48:44,360 --> 00:48:47,796
whether they want a prick on their side
or some kindergarten teacher...

728
00:48:47,863 --> 00:48:49,797
who's gonna kiss their ass!

729
00:48:49,865 --> 00:48:52,800
Because when that day comes
I want the prick...

730
00:48:52,868 --> 00:48:54,802
and so will you.

731
00:49:05,881 --> 00:49:09,214
You know, I forget
how young you are, Mitch...

732
00:49:09,285 --> 00:49:12,379
that you think you have to be a prick
to get things done...

733
00:49:12,454 --> 00:49:15,890
and that you actually think
that that's a new idea.

734
00:49:29,672 --> 00:49:33,108
You know what I oughta do?
Take it to the state medical board.

735
00:49:33,175 --> 00:49:36,941
There's gotta be some constitutional
right for visiting the sick.

736
00:49:40,549 --> 00:49:42,483
Why don't you
say anything?

737
00:49:42,551 --> 00:49:44,815
Sorry, Patch.

738
00:49:44,887 --> 00:49:46,821
I think Walcott
has a point.

739
00:49:46,889 --> 00:49:48,652
It's a hospital.

740
00:49:48,724 --> 00:49:51,818
People are suffering
and dying.

741
00:49:51,894 --> 00:49:56,797
We're all dying, Truman.
Our job is to increase health.

742
00:49:56,865 --> 00:49:58,799
You know what that means?

743
00:49:58,867 --> 00:50:01,995
That means improving the quality
of life, not just delaying death.

744
00:50:03,505 --> 00:50:05,439
Either way, l--

745
00:50:05,507 --> 00:50:10,843
For your own sake, I th-- I think you
should just lay low for a while.

746
00:50:12,314 --> 00:50:14,248
Maybe you're right.

747
00:50:40,075 --> 00:50:43,567
Preview of coming attractions.

748
00:50:43,645 --> 00:50:45,579
Nurse.

749
00:50:45,647 --> 00:50:51,948
"Death. To die. To expire.
To pass on. To perish."

750
00:50:52,449 --> 00:50:53,882
To peg out. To push up daisies.
To push up posies.

751
00:50:53,950 --> 00:50:55,747
To become extinct.

752
00:50:55,819 --> 00:51:00,085
Curtains, deceased, demised,
departed and defunct.

753
00:51:00,157 --> 00:51:02,182
Dead as a doornail.
Dead as a herring.

754
00:51:02,259 --> 00:51:04,750
Dead as a mutton.
Dead as nits.

755
00:51:04,828 --> 00:51:09,561
The last breath. Paying a debt
to nature. The big sleep.

756
00:51:09,633 --> 00:51:12,761
God's way of saying,
"Slow down."

757
00:51:25,148 --> 00:51:27,082
To check out.

758
00:51:30,253 --> 00:51:32,721
To shuffle off
this mortal coil.

759
00:51:32,789 --> 00:51:35,053
To head for
the happy hunting ground.

760
00:51:35,125 --> 00:51:37,719
To blink for an exceptionally long
period of time.

761
00:51:37,794 --> 00:51:40,285
To find oneself
without breath.

762
00:51:40,363 --> 00:51:44,129
- To be the incredible decaying man.
- Worm buffet.

763
00:51:44,201 --> 00:51:46,226
- Kick the bucket.
- Buy the farm.

764
00:51:46,303 --> 00:51:48,601
- Take the cab.
- Cash in your chips.

765
00:51:48,672 --> 00:51:51,539
And if we bury you ass up,
we have a place to park my bike.

766
00:51:54,277 --> 00:51:58,213
Whoo! Comin' out of chute number nine,
ridin' that morphine pony!

767
00:51:58,281 --> 00:52:00,146
Whoo-aaah!

768
00:52:00,217 --> 00:52:02,981
Come on now.
Hey, yeah

769
00:52:03,053 --> 00:52:05,988
Let's check out the maternity ward.
You know those chicks put out.

770
00:52:07,891 --> 00:52:12,988
Here we see that the vitreous body
is composed of a transparent jelly...

771
00:52:13,063 --> 00:52:14,997
with a mesh
of collagen fibers.

772
00:52:15,065 --> 00:52:16,999
Lights, please.

773
00:52:17,067 --> 00:52:21,128
Uh, before we adjourn
Dean Walcott has a brief announcement.

774
00:52:21,204 --> 00:52:23,331
He's gonna have the sex change!

775
00:52:24,641 --> 00:52:26,575
Next Monday
the hospital is hosting...

776
00:52:26,643 --> 00:52:28,907
a medical
seminar-slash-retreat...

777
00:52:28,979 --> 00:52:32,278
for the Fellowship of the
American College of Gynecologists.

778
00:52:32,349 --> 00:52:34,340
I'll get the strippers.

779
00:52:34,417 --> 00:52:37,909
It is important that they
be received in a manner suitable
to their status and position.

780
00:52:37,988 --> 00:52:42,254
I have traditionally selected
an outstanding student...

781
00:52:42,325 --> 00:52:44,418
to head
the welcoming committee.

782
00:52:44,494 --> 00:52:47,588
The time demands are great,
and I wouldn't want to jeopardize...

783
00:52:47,664 --> 00:52:50,599
the academic performance
of a weaker student.

784
00:52:50,667 --> 00:52:53,033
This year I have chosen...

785
00:52:53,103 --> 00:52:54,798
Hunter Adams.

786
00:52:54,871 --> 00:52:56,805
Oh. Well, thank you.

787
00:52:56,873 --> 00:52:58,363
Hunter...

788
00:52:58,441 --> 00:53:01,808
there's a detailed list
of instructions in my office.

789
00:53:01,878 --> 00:53:06,508
Oh, and, uh, the auditorium
could use a good cleaning.

790
00:53:13,223 --> 00:53:17,489
Did you hear him? "In a style according
to their stature and position."

791
00:53:17,560 --> 00:53:21,997
"I am a great doctor!
Worship me! Spread before me!

792
00:53:22,065 --> 00:53:24,499
Who dares stand?"

793
00:53:24,567 --> 00:53:28,833
You know what I'm thinking? Maybe we
should decorate with a western motif.

794
00:53:28,905 --> 00:53:30,839
How about that?
Ah.

795
00:53:30,907 --> 00:53:33,842
Something with stirrups
and a big banner that says...

796
00:53:33,910 --> 00:53:36,845
"Howdy, gyneroos!
Dilated to meet ya!"

797
00:53:36,913 --> 00:53:39,848
- How about that?
- How about just doing it straight?

798
00:53:39,916 --> 00:53:42,851
- What do you mean?
- As in, straight to graduation.

799
00:53:42,919 --> 00:53:48,016
Oh. If anybody has a problem with this,
please, just walk away right now.

800
00:53:52,929 --> 00:53:55,056
Oh.

801
00:53:55,131 --> 00:53:57,065
All right.

802
00:53:57,133 --> 00:53:59,567
Wow! Yes!

803
00:53:59,636 --> 00:54:01,627
Okay.

804
00:54:09,412 --> 00:54:11,346
They're right on time.

805
00:54:11,414 --> 00:54:13,678
Good morning, Doctor.
Welcome to campus. Good to see you.

806
00:54:13,750 --> 00:54:15,684
How you doing, Doctor?

807
00:54:15,752 --> 00:54:19,347
Uh, gentlemen, I believe that
you'll find the facilities here...

808
00:54:19,422 --> 00:54:21,515
are just perfect
for your purposes today.

809
00:54:21,591 --> 00:54:24,526
We have everything set up
in the auditorium.

810
00:54:24,594 --> 00:54:26,528
If you'd just follow me--

811
00:54:33,336 --> 00:54:35,861
Welcome, cold-handed ones.

812
00:54:35,939 --> 00:54:39,067
It's an honor
to greet-slash-welcome...

813
00:54:39,142 --> 00:54:43,306
so many who have touched so many women
is such a powerful way.

814
00:54:43,380 --> 00:54:45,314
Come on in.

815
00:54:45,382 --> 00:54:47,316
Watch out.
It's a little slippery.

816
00:54:47,384 --> 00:54:50,820
And if you think
it's hot out there-- Whoa!

817
00:54:50,887 --> 00:54:54,254
Come on!

818
00:54:54,324 --> 00:54:56,918
Get him
in my office now.

819
00:54:59,496 --> 00:55:01,691
All right, gentlemen,
if, uh-- Ahem--

820
00:55:01,765 --> 00:55:03,699
if you'd
just follow me.

821
00:55:21,551 --> 00:55:23,849
You wanted
to see me, sir?

822
00:55:25,088 --> 00:55:27,022
You are dismissed.

823
00:55:27,090 --> 00:55:28,853
Sir.

824
00:55:28,925 --> 00:55:31,359
From this school.

825
00:55:31,428 --> 00:55:33,362
Kindly remove your things...

826
00:55:33,430 --> 00:55:35,762
and vacate the school premises
as soon as possible.

827
00:55:35,832 --> 00:55:37,527
What for?

828
00:55:37,600 --> 00:55:40,535
For asking a group of doctors to have
a sense of humor about themselves?

829
00:55:40,603 --> 00:55:43,538
Oh, I have a sense of humor, Hunter.

830
00:55:43,606 --> 00:55:46,541
I find it hilarious that,
as smart as you are...

831
00:55:46,609 --> 00:55:50,306
you could give me an airtight reason
to throw you the hell out of here!

832
00:55:50,380 --> 00:55:53,838
Why am I such a threat
to you, sir?

833
00:55:53,917 --> 00:55:57,614
Because what you want
is for us to get down there
on the same level as our patients...

834
00:55:57,687 --> 00:55:59,621
to destroy objectivity...

835
00:55:59,689 --> 00:56:02,624
all to uphold some
idealistic buddy system...

836
00:56:02,692 --> 00:56:07,459
that will allow you to work through
your own feelings of inadequacy.

837
00:56:11,034 --> 00:56:13,366
What you have done here today...

838
00:56:13,436 --> 00:56:15,370
is inexcusable.

839
00:56:15,438 --> 00:56:18,965
You have made a complete mockery
out of our distinguished guests.

840
00:56:19,042 --> 00:56:24,139
If you think that I will further
tolerate your blatant disregard
of the bylaws of this--

841
00:56:25,281 --> 00:56:27,215
What are you smiling at?

842
00:56:27,283 --> 00:56:29,911
Is this all
a big joke to you?

843
00:56:29,986 --> 00:56:32,250
Get out of here!

844
00:56:42,632 --> 00:56:45,567
Blatant disregard for
school code and procedure.

845
00:56:45,635 --> 00:56:48,069
Defying direct orders
from a dean.

846
00:56:48,138 --> 00:56:51,073
And I am aware
of your creative efforts...

847
00:56:51,141 --> 00:56:54,076
to make sure our visiting gynecologists
feel right at home.

848
00:56:54,144 --> 00:56:58,843
- Now, what is it you'd
like me to do for you?
- I want to graduate, sir.

849
00:56:58,915 --> 00:57:00,780
Dean Walcott
thinks otherwise...

850
00:57:00,850 --> 00:57:03,250
but my grades
are way above par.

851
00:57:03,319 --> 00:57:06,254
I want to finish school
so I can become a doctor.

852
00:57:06,322 --> 00:57:09,257
Well, I'm gonna give this
to you real straight.

853
00:57:09,325 --> 00:57:12,260
I have a hospital and a medical school
to run here.

854
00:57:12,328 --> 00:57:14,455
I have to trust the people
in my employ...

855
00:57:14,531 --> 00:57:17,466
otherwise their quality of life
will turn to shit.

856
00:57:17,534 --> 00:57:20,025
Their life turns to shit,
my life turns to shit. Do you follow?

857
00:57:20,103 --> 00:57:23,038
- Yes.
- Good.

858
00:57:23,106 --> 00:57:27,372
Now, uh, Dean Walcott is a--
a pain in the ass...

859
00:57:27,443 --> 00:57:31,971
but I depend on him to keep me up to
speed on what's going on around here...

860
00:57:32,048 --> 00:57:35,484
and I would never take the word
of any student over his.

861
00:57:36,619 --> 00:57:38,280
However...

862
00:57:38,354 --> 00:57:42,290
I also have a source
that informs me that your antics...

863
00:57:42,358 --> 00:57:45,293
have improved the quality of life
for the patients.

864
00:57:45,361 --> 00:57:48,296
They don't complain as much,
they take less medication...

865
00:57:48,364 --> 00:57:51,458
and, uh, what's-his-name over in 305
has not thrown his bedpan at a nurse...

866
00:57:51,534 --> 00:57:53,468
in over a week.

867
00:57:53,536 --> 00:57:56,232
- It's Bill.
- Yeah, whatever.

868
00:57:56,306 --> 00:57:59,673
So, from now on you will not
enter that hospital...

869
00:57:59,742 --> 00:58:03,269
unless under the supervision of the
attendant, as part of the curriculum...

870
00:58:03,346 --> 00:58:07,077
and you will steer clear
of Dean Walcott.

871
00:58:07,150 --> 00:58:10,813
Yes, sir.
So I'm still in school?

872
00:58:10,887 --> 00:58:12,821
I wouldn't
send my laundry out...

873
00:58:12,889 --> 00:58:15,414
but, uh, you just
don't screw up, huh?

874
00:58:30,258 --> 00:58:33,227
Come in. Please come in.

875
00:58:33,295 --> 00:58:35,786
Hello?

876
00:58:35,864 --> 00:58:38,332
- Hello.
- Patch?

877
00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:40,834
- Welcome.
- What are you doing?

878
00:58:40,902 --> 00:58:44,861
- I thought we were studying.
- We're studying cellular biology.

879
00:58:44,939 --> 00:58:47,806
Where are you?

880
00:58:47,876 --> 00:58:49,810
Somewhere.

881
00:58:49,878 --> 00:58:52,210
Surprise!

882
00:58:52,280 --> 00:58:54,771
- Happy birthday!
- Happy birthday!

883
00:58:54,849 --> 00:58:56,817
I don't believe this.
Where is he?

884
00:58:56,885 --> 00:58:59,376
- I just saw him around here somewhere.
- Where is he, Truman?

885
00:58:59,454 --> 00:59:01,979
He's here. You gotta find him.

886
00:59:02,057 --> 00:59:03,991
- Patch?
- Ha-ha!

887
00:59:07,629 --> 00:59:10,689
"I do not love you as if
you were a salt rose or topaz...

888
00:59:10,765 --> 00:59:14,496
or the air o'er carnations
that fire shoots off.

889
00:59:14,569 --> 00:59:17,197
I love you as certain dark
things are to be loved...

890
00:59:17,272 --> 00:59:20,673
in secret 'tween
the shadow and the soul."

891
00:59:23,178 --> 00:59:25,112
We'll finish it later.

892
00:59:26,247 --> 00:59:29,239
What the hell is this?
Hunter.

893
00:59:29,317 --> 00:59:31,376
Hunter, please answer me!

894
00:59:31,453 --> 00:59:34,616
Stop laughing! Truman, I see you!

895
00:59:34,689 --> 00:59:38,489
Who the hell are you? You aren't--

896
00:59:38,560 --> 00:59:40,755
Oh! Oh, damn it!

897
00:59:40,829 --> 00:59:45,459
I hurt my ankle!
Somebody get somebody please!

898
00:59:45,533 --> 00:59:49,299
Someone-- Hello? My ankle!

899
00:59:49,371 --> 00:59:52,465
You could have saved yourself
a lot of trouble and just asked me out.

900
00:59:52,540 --> 00:59:55,976
Who said anything
about asking you out?

901
00:59:57,112 --> 00:59:59,239
I heard something
about you.

902
00:59:59,314 --> 01:00:02,215
- That I was in a mental hospital?
- Is it true?

903
01:00:02,283 --> 01:00:04,217
Tried to kill myself.

904
01:00:04,285 --> 01:00:07,413
The mental ward was the best thing
that ever happened to me.

905
01:00:08,990 --> 01:00:13,484
- What did the doctors do to help you?
- The doctors didn't help me.

906
01:00:13,561 --> 01:00:16,086
The patients helped me.

907
01:00:16,164 --> 01:00:20,658
They helped me realize
that by helping them I could
forget about my own problems.

908
01:00:20,735 --> 01:00:24,637
And I did.
I really helped some of them.

909
01:00:24,706 --> 01:00:28,107
It was an incredible
feeling, Carin.

910
01:00:29,244 --> 01:00:32,475
There was one patient
named Rudy.

911
01:00:32,547 --> 01:00:35,539
I helped him
be able to pee.

912
01:00:35,617 --> 01:00:40,020
But for the first time in my life,
I forgot about my own problems.

913
01:00:40,088 --> 01:00:42,420
It was an incredible high.

914
01:00:44,692 --> 01:00:46,626
What?

915
01:00:48,296 --> 01:00:52,960
It's just that, um, somebody,
you know, could do for me...

916
01:00:53,034 --> 01:00:56,800
what you did for me tonight
after the way I've treated you.

917
01:00:56,871 --> 01:01:00,671
No one's ever done anything
like that for me before.

918
01:01:05,747 --> 01:01:07,681
Thank you.

919
01:01:08,750 --> 01:01:10,684
Good night.

920
01:01:13,888 --> 01:01:18,120
No, this is not a good night.
This is a great night!

921
01:01:18,193 --> 01:01:20,821
You know?

922
01:01:52,227 --> 01:01:55,219
Hi, I'm John the Baptist.
Any calls?

923
01:01:55,296 --> 01:01:58,197
I've been trying
to reach you.

924
01:01:59,534 --> 01:02:02,560
I love you.

925
01:02:04,639 --> 01:02:07,233
Let's go outside. Okay?

926
01:02:23,658 --> 01:02:27,025
Hey, Bill.

927
01:02:27,095 --> 01:02:29,893
Turquoise is a nice color
on you.

928
01:02:34,469 --> 01:02:37,404
You don't have to say anything.
I know I look good.

929
01:02:40,408 --> 01:02:42,342
My boys.

930
01:02:44,479 --> 01:02:47,039
My boys are beautiful, hmm?

931
01:02:47,115 --> 01:02:50,243
- Yeah.
- Did you see my boys?

932
01:02:50,318 --> 01:02:52,309
Yeah.

933
01:02:53,388 --> 01:02:56,721
She's not bad either.

934
01:02:56,791 --> 01:02:59,726
You think after you're gone,
maybe I could--

935
01:03:02,764 --> 01:03:07,326
Oh, you're killin' me here,
Patch.

936
01:03:16,344 --> 01:03:20,178
S-Sing me that stupid song.

937
01:03:24,919 --> 01:03:28,377
Blue skies smilin' at me

938
01:03:28,456 --> 01:03:31,118
Nothin' but blue skies

939
01:03:31,192 --> 01:03:34,127
Do I see

940
01:03:34,195 --> 01:03:37,392
Bluebirds singin' a song

941
01:03:38,566 --> 01:03:41,228
Nothin' but bluebirds

942
01:03:41,302 --> 01:03:43,395
All day long

943
01:03:54,949 --> 01:03:57,179
Blue days

944
01:03:57,251 --> 01:04:00,152
All of them gone

945
01:04:01,656 --> 01:04:05,148
Nothin' but blue skies

946
01:04:05,226 --> 01:04:07,660
From now on

947
01:04:12,400 --> 01:04:14,334
See you, Bill.

948
01:04:31,986 --> 01:04:34,921
Por favor.  Dejeme ver a mi nina!

949
01:04:34,989 --> 01:04:37,287
- I'm sorry, ma'am.
- Somebody speak--  Alguien, ayudeme!

950
01:04:37,358 --> 01:04:40,191
-  Dejeme ver a mi nina!
- I need the forms filled out.

951
01:04:40,261 --> 01:04:42,559
My baby! My baby!

952
01:04:42,630 --> 01:04:46,088
Ma'am, if you fill out the forms,
you can see her in a moment.

953
01:04:46,167 --> 01:04:48,260
- Alguien--
- Excuse me.

954
01:04:48,336 --> 01:04:51,999
- What's going on here?
- Oh, drunk driver.
She lost her husband and son.

955
01:04:52,073 --> 01:04:55,839
- Her daughter's in Trauma One,
but it doesn't look good.
- I need the forms filled out.

956
01:04:55,910 --> 01:04:59,073
- Please!  Quiero ver a mi nina!
- You can see her in one moment.

957
01:04:59,147 --> 01:05:02,378
 Quiero ver a mi nina!
My baby! Please!

958
01:05:02,450 --> 01:05:05,112
Maybe you could explain
it to me so I might understand it.

959
01:05:05,186 --> 01:05:07,120
It's hospital procedure.

960
01:05:07,188 --> 01:05:10,715
It isn't right that a woman has to spend
the last moments of her dying child...

961
01:05:10,792 --> 01:05:12,726
filling out forms.

962
01:05:12,794 --> 01:05:15,092
Last year I had to have my appendix out.

963
01:05:15,163 --> 01:05:18,690
I forgot my insurance card,
so they sent me home.

964
01:05:18,766 --> 01:05:21,200
My appendix could have burst.
They didn't care.

965
01:05:21,269 --> 01:05:25,171
You know, my antibiotics
cost 100 bucks a month.

966
01:05:25,239 --> 01:05:28,675
I paid $250 just to find out
I had a sprained ankle.

967
01:05:28,743 --> 01:05:32,406
- I mean, do they really need
to do all those tests?
- You know what they need to do.

968
01:05:32,480 --> 01:05:34,744
The government needs
to pay for health insurance.

969
01:05:34,816 --> 01:05:38,650
Health insurance companies are why
prices got so high in the first place.

970
01:05:38,720 --> 01:05:41,553
- What do we do?
- Yeah, what the hell is the answer?

971
01:05:41,622 --> 01:05:44,750
- Don't hurt your ankle.
- Yeah, right.

972
01:05:49,897 --> 01:05:53,298
- Patch?
- Mm-hmm. Wait, wait, wait, wait.

973
01:06:03,711 --> 01:06:06,680
That's it.

974
01:06:08,483 --> 01:06:10,417
- I gotta tell Carin.
- What?

975
01:06:10,485 --> 01:06:12,112
Oh.

976
01:06:12,186 --> 01:06:14,620
- Can I borrow this stuff?
- Sure.

977
01:06:26,255 --> 01:06:28,621
- What do you see?
- Patch, it's late.

978
01:06:28,691 --> 01:06:31,091
What do you see?

979
01:06:31,160 --> 01:06:33,685
Parsley.

980
01:06:33,763 --> 01:06:35,697
- And a horn.
- No, no, no.

981
01:06:35,765 --> 01:06:38,791
Look beyond the objects.
Look through them.

982
01:06:38,868 --> 01:06:41,962
Over here. Look.

983
01:06:42,037 --> 01:06:44,767
Kind of let them blur.
Tell me the first thing you see.

984
01:06:44,840 --> 01:06:47,104
- Something with a nose.
- Okay.

985
01:06:47,176 --> 01:06:49,838
Now imagine that's a building
with a nose.

986
01:06:49,912 --> 01:06:53,177
- A free hospital.
- A free hospital.

987
01:06:53,249 --> 01:06:55,183
- Can I go back to bed now?
- No, no.

988
01:06:55,251 --> 01:06:57,719
Because I'm bursting with ideas,
and I need you to help me.

989
01:06:57,787 --> 01:07:00,950
It'll be the first fun hospital
in the world.

990
01:07:01,023 --> 01:07:03,116
It'll be a totally
free-form building.

991
01:07:03,192 --> 01:07:06,525
It'll have, like, slides
and secret passageways and game rooms.

992
01:07:06,595 --> 01:07:09,428
- Slow down. I can't write that fast.
- I can't slow down.

993
01:07:09,498 --> 01:07:12,558
We'll use humor
to heal pain and suffering.

994
01:07:12,635 --> 01:07:15,331
Doctors and patients
will work side-by-side as peers.

995
01:07:15,404 --> 01:07:18,066
There'll be no titles,
no bosses.

996
01:07:18,140 --> 01:07:22,406
People will come from all over
the world to fulfill their dream
of helping other people.

997
01:07:22,478 --> 01:07:24,946
They'll be a community
where joy is a way of life...

998
01:07:25,014 --> 01:07:29,280
where learning is the highest aim,
where love is the ultimate goal.

999
01:07:29,351 --> 01:07:32,718
- You have all that?
- Yeah, not verbatim, but
the overall insanity's intact.

1000
01:07:32,788 --> 01:07:34,722
- That's why you have to help me.
- Patch, no.

1001
01:07:34,790 --> 01:07:36,587
- Yes.
- No.

1002
01:07:36,659 --> 01:07:40,322
I know it's not gonna be easy, but you
said anything worth doing is difficult.

1003
01:07:40,396 --> 01:07:42,523
Look, um--

1004
01:07:42,598 --> 01:07:45,260
I'm not like you, Patch.

1005
01:07:45,334 --> 01:07:48,497
I want the white coat. I want people
to call me doctor more than anything.

1006
01:07:48,571 --> 01:07:52,701
- I want the recognition.
- You'll get it every day in the
eyes of patients you're helping.

1007
01:07:52,775 --> 01:07:56,370
There is more to life than
what Dean Walcott puts out there.

1008
01:07:56,445 --> 01:08:00,506
That is all about power
and control, all right?

1009
01:08:00,583 --> 01:08:03,143
- I know you're scared.
- You're right. I am scared.

1010
01:08:03,219 --> 01:08:05,153
I'm scared to death.

1011
01:08:08,657 --> 01:08:12,889
You know, you sit here and you talk
about life without limits...

1012
01:08:12,962 --> 01:08:15,829
you know,
and breaking the rules.

1013
01:08:15,898 --> 01:08:18,833
It all sounds
very, very romantic.

1014
01:08:20,436 --> 01:08:23,667
You wanna know what the truth
is about all that crap, Patch, hmm?

1015
01:08:23,739 --> 01:08:26,401
People get hurt.

1016
01:08:28,410 --> 01:08:30,344
And who did it to you?

1017
01:08:34,483 --> 01:08:37,975
- I have to go.
- No, don't. Please. No, no.
Listen to me. Come on.

1018
01:08:38,053 --> 01:08:40,248
Whatever it is-- Come on.
You can tell me.

1019
01:08:40,322 --> 01:08:42,756
- I can help you. I swear I can.
- Good night. I'll see you tomorrow.

1020
01:08:42,825 --> 01:08:45,885
Please, let me help you.

1021
01:08:45,961 --> 01:08:48,896
I'm really starting to love
the back of your head.

1022
01:09:08,217 --> 01:09:11,778
Get this cleaned out,
and get him down to the suture room.

1023
01:09:11,854 --> 01:09:13,788
You're gonna be fine, Larry.

1024
01:09:15,424 --> 01:09:18,393
Larry's been in and out of
the E.R. for a couple of years.

1025
01:09:18,460 --> 01:09:21,725
- Not because he's accident-prone.
- No. His father died two years ago.

1026
01:09:21,797 --> 01:09:24,994
Since then he's been subject to fits
of depression and self-mutilation.

1027
01:09:25,067 --> 01:09:27,262
Head trauma, D-5.

1028
01:09:31,006 --> 01:09:34,874
- Thank you for doing this.
- You can thank me
by not getting me fired.

1029
01:09:34,944 --> 01:09:38,675
Just observe rounds
and stay within hospital protocol.

1030
01:09:38,747 --> 01:09:40,681
Look, Patch.

1031
01:09:40,749 --> 01:09:43,411
You're a good thing
for this hospital.

1032
01:09:43,485 --> 01:09:45,680
You remind me of myself
when I first started out--

1033
01:09:45,754 --> 01:09:48,188
on fire,
wanting to save the world.

1034
01:09:48,257 --> 01:09:50,953
But you lose a little of that
after a while.

1035
01:09:51,026 --> 01:09:53,824
The system is what it is. It's not
perfect, but it's all we have.

1036
01:09:53,896 --> 01:09:57,855
Why does it have to be all we have?
Why can't it be changed?

1037
01:09:57,933 --> 01:10:00,834
You figure out how, Patch...

1038
01:10:00,903 --> 01:10:02,837
and I'll be there for you.

1039
01:10:02,905 --> 01:10:06,932
Bed six
needs blood work.

1040
01:10:07,009 --> 01:10:09,944
Mrs. O'Bannon
needs blood work.

1041
01:10:11,146 --> 01:10:14,138
Hello, Ed.
You feeling a little dizzy?

1042
01:10:14,216 --> 01:10:16,650
- Yeah.
- Hello, Mrs. O'Bannon.

1043
01:10:16,719 --> 01:10:19,984
- May I call you Catherine?
We're gonna draw a little blood.
- Mm-hmm.

1044
01:10:20,055 --> 01:10:22,853
Can you tell how many fingers
I'm holding up?

1045
01:10:24,727 --> 01:10:26,661
How many do you see?

1046
01:10:26,729 --> 01:10:28,663
How many fingers?

1047
01:10:32,668 --> 01:10:35,102
- How many fingers do you see, Ed?

1048
01:10:45,247 --> 01:10:47,738
How much longer do I have
to keep my eyes closed?

1049
01:10:47,816 --> 01:10:49,750
Just till I open mine.

1050
01:10:49,818 --> 01:10:51,979
Keep 'em closed.

1051
01:10:52,054 --> 01:10:54,648
You're almost there.

1052
01:11:03,365 --> 01:11:05,526
Not like that. This way.

1053
01:11:05,601 --> 01:11:08,092
Come on. Come on.

1054
01:11:08,170 --> 01:11:10,536
There you go.
All right.

1055
01:11:10,606 --> 01:11:13,473
Here, here.
Hold on to me.

1056
01:11:13,542 --> 01:11:15,669
It's just a little further.
Just a little further.

1057
01:11:15,744 --> 01:11:17,939
- All right, all right.
- There you go.

1058
01:11:18,013 --> 01:11:20,277
There you are.
That's all right.

1059
01:11:20,349 --> 01:11:22,283
- You're almost there.
- I'm afraid.

1060
01:11:22,351 --> 01:11:24,649
Don't be afraid.
It's gonna be worth it.

1061
01:11:24,720 --> 01:11:27,188
All right. Ready?
Watch your step.

1062
01:11:27,256 --> 01:11:31,090
There you go.
And... open your eyes.

1063
01:11:33,162 --> 01:11:35,096
It's beautiful.

1064
01:11:35,164 --> 01:11:38,031
It's 105 acres
of all-natural forest.

1065
01:11:38,100 --> 01:11:41,797
Seven streams, two waterfalls.

1066
01:11:41,870 --> 01:11:45,306
This is it-- the future site
of the Gesundheit lnstitute.

1067
01:11:46,542 --> 01:11:48,476
This is yours?

1068
01:11:48,544 --> 01:11:51,945
Not yet,
but it will be soon.

1069
01:11:52,014 --> 01:11:54,448
- Come on. There's something else.
- Hmm?

1070
01:12:03,692 --> 01:12:05,626
What is it?

1071
01:12:06,829 --> 01:12:09,161
Our new home.

1072
01:12:09,231 --> 01:12:11,791
Carin, what do you think?

1073
01:12:12,868 --> 01:12:16,304
- How did you... find this?
- Him.

1074
01:12:16,371 --> 01:12:20,740
Arthur Mendelson. All this is his--
the land, the cottage.

1075
01:12:20,809 --> 01:12:23,175
He's letting us borrow it
till we can purchase it.

1076
01:12:23,245 --> 01:12:26,578
Mr. Mendelson, I realize that under
the terms of your commitment...

1077
01:12:26,648 --> 01:12:28,878
you retained control
of your assets.

1078
01:12:28,951 --> 01:12:31,613
- Nevertheless--
- You learn anything
about proctology yet, Patch?

1079
01:12:31,687 --> 01:12:33,621
- A little bit.
- Good.

1080
01:12:33,689 --> 01:12:36,157
Take care of this asshole
for me, will ya?

1081
01:12:36,225 --> 01:12:40,559
- Nice meeting you.
- Yeah. Mr. Mendelson, uh--

1082
01:12:40,629 --> 01:12:43,154
There's room for you.

1083
01:12:44,766 --> 01:12:47,599
- Hi, Bile.
- Hey, Patch.

1084
01:12:47,669 --> 01:12:49,728
- Who's Bile?
- An old friend.

1085
01:12:49,805 --> 01:12:52,273
- Oh.
- Without medical insurance.

1086
01:12:52,341 --> 01:12:54,809
He's just staying here
a couple of days.

1087
01:12:54,877 --> 01:12:57,311
What do you say?

1088
01:13:03,752 --> 01:13:05,686
Think potential.

1089
01:13:13,896 --> 01:13:17,889
Hey.

1090
01:13:29,478 --> 01:13:32,572
You're certainly a lovely couple.
We can't go on meeting like this.

1091
01:13:35,651 --> 01:13:37,585
Ma'am, this card is expired.

1092
01:13:37,653 --> 01:13:39,553
Have you a valid card?

1093
01:13:39,621 --> 01:13:43,387
Huh? Medicine.
Chinese medicine.

1094
01:14:24,233 --> 01:14:27,691
Yeah, yeah. That's painful there.

1095
01:14:27,769 --> 01:14:31,068
Uh, hang on a second.
I only have one arm.

1096
01:14:31,139 --> 01:14:33,073
Gesundheit.

1097
01:14:33,141 --> 01:14:36,372
- Let's go!
- Yeah. Uh-huh.

1098
01:14:38,313 --> 01:14:41,441
Uh-huh. Yeah.

1099
01:14:41,516 --> 01:14:44,815
Hi. How can we help you?

1100
01:14:45,888 --> 01:14:47,822
I don't know.

1101
01:14:47,890 --> 01:14:50,825
Uh, I h-heard about this place...

1102
01:14:50,893 --> 01:14:54,693
and l, I thought maybe
I would get some, uh--

1103
01:14:54,763 --> 01:14:57,960
You know, maybe I'd talk to somebody,
because my thoughts--

1104
01:14:58,033 --> 01:15:00,501
This is crazy.

1105
01:15:00,569 --> 01:15:03,367
Word's getting out
we're handling the overflow from
three different clinics now.

1106
01:15:03,438 --> 01:15:07,340
I start my pediatric clerkship
next week. I don't know how
I'm gonna... keep up.

1107
01:15:07,409 --> 01:15:10,401
Anybody call for a doctor in here?

1108
01:15:10,479 --> 01:15:12,743
Let's try this right now.
There. Look at that there.

1109
01:15:12,814 --> 01:15:16,079
Hey, thank you, Judy and Cissy,
for that lovely medicine.

1110
01:15:18,921 --> 01:15:22,789
- How you feeling, Frank?
You feel better?
- Yeah, feel better.

1111
01:15:22,858 --> 01:15:25,452
Well, keep on your medication. You can
never go wrong if you're a Marxist.

1112
01:15:25,527 --> 01:15:27,495
Hey, Patch?

1113
01:15:27,562 --> 01:15:29,553
- Yes?
- This is, um-- I didn't get your name.

1114
01:15:29,631 --> 01:15:32,293
- Uh, Larry.
- Hi, Larry. How are you?

1115
01:15:32,367 --> 01:15:34,494
- Good.
- Nice to meet you.

1116
01:15:34,569 --> 01:15:37,094
What are you passionate about, Larry?
What excites you?

1117
01:15:37,172 --> 01:15:39,697
- What turns you on?
- I like to read.

1118
01:15:39,775 --> 01:15:42,005
I love to read. What do you like
to read? Who's your favorite author?

1119
01:15:42,077 --> 01:15:44,443
- Mmm, Kazantzakis.
- Kazantzakis.

1120
01:15:44,513 --> 01:15:48,574
Oh. "World is trouble.
Man needs a little madness, or else--"

1121
01:15:48,650 --> 01:15:50,880
"Or else he dare not
cut the rope and be free."

1122
01:15:50,953 --> 01:15:52,887
That's great, Larry.
That's wonderful.

1123
01:15:52,955 --> 01:15:54,889
We're gonna get along just fine.
Truman.

1124
01:15:54,957 --> 01:15:58,120
- Yeah, Patch. What?
- Can you come over here
and show Larry around?

1125
01:15:58,193 --> 01:16:00,957
- Nice having you here, Larry. Welcome.
- Thanks. Okay.

1126
01:16:04,266 --> 01:16:08,134
- I've seen Larry in the E.R. before.
- He's weird.

1127
01:16:08,203 --> 01:16:11,604
I'm weird. If we don't
show him compassion, who will?

1128
01:16:17,879 --> 01:16:21,576
What's that name again? Right.

1129
01:16:43,105 --> 01:16:45,039
- Hi.
- Hi.

1130
01:16:56,351 --> 01:16:58,615
- Everyone asleep?
- Yeah.

1131
01:16:58,687 --> 01:17:00,621
But it ain't me.

1132
01:17:06,728 --> 01:17:08,662
You okay?

1133
01:17:11,266 --> 01:17:13,200
- Yeah.
- Hmm.

1134
01:17:18,206 --> 01:17:20,572
God, Patch, it's amazing.

1135
01:17:20,642 --> 01:17:22,576
What?

1136
01:17:22,644 --> 01:17:26,375
Just what you've done
with this place, you know.

1137
01:17:26,448 --> 01:17:28,882
- You too.
- Well.

1138
01:17:31,853 --> 01:17:33,787
These people
that we're helping--

1139
01:17:33,855 --> 01:17:36,289
they would have had
nowhere to go.

1140
01:17:38,693 --> 01:17:40,627
You're a good man.

1141
01:17:52,774 --> 01:17:55,072
What are we?

1142
01:17:56,578 --> 01:17:58,512
Is it me?

1143
01:18:01,616 --> 01:18:07,020
I mean, are we just-- are we
good friends that occasionally kiss?

1144
01:18:13,462 --> 01:18:16,226
Patch...

1145
01:18:16,298 --> 01:18:18,266
my entire life...

1146
01:18:18,333 --> 01:18:21,496
men have been...

1147
01:18:21,570 --> 01:18:23,538
attracted to me.

1148
01:18:28,743 --> 01:18:30,677
My entire life.

1149
01:18:40,589 --> 01:18:42,523
When I was a little girl...

1150
01:18:42,591 --> 01:18:45,526
I would look out my bedroom window
at the caterpillars.

1151
01:18:47,395 --> 01:18:49,329
I envied them so much.

1152
01:18:51,433 --> 01:18:53,367
No matter
what they were before...

1153
01:18:53,435 --> 01:18:56,871
no matter...
what happened to them...

1154
01:18:56,938 --> 01:19:01,807
they could just hide away,
you know...

1155
01:19:01,877 --> 01:19:05,973
and turn into these beautiful
creatures that could fly away...

1156
01:19:06,047 --> 01:19:07,981
completely untouched.

1157
01:19:16,525 --> 01:19:19,892
I hated men so much.

1158
01:19:25,233 --> 01:19:27,895
I wanted nothing
to do with them.

1159
01:19:42,284 --> 01:19:44,218
Then I met you.

1160
01:19:48,924 --> 01:19:51,859
The way that
you help people, Patch--

1161
01:19:54,462 --> 01:19:58,330
The changes I see
in everybody that's around you--

1162
01:20:13,982 --> 01:20:16,075
I love you.

1163
01:20:16,151 --> 01:20:20,178
I've loved you for so long.

1164
01:20:54,789 --> 01:20:58,122
You scared me.

1165
01:20:58,193 --> 01:21:00,991
I was watching you sleep.

1166
01:21:01,062 --> 01:21:04,793
I have a real knack.
Impressive, hmm?

1167
01:21:07,569 --> 01:21:10,561
"I love you
without knowing how...

1168
01:21:10,639 --> 01:21:12,937
"or when or from where.

1169
01:21:13,008 --> 01:21:15,169
- I love you straight--"
- Patch.

1170
01:21:17,946 --> 01:21:19,811
Um, sorry.

1171
01:21:19,881 --> 01:21:21,678
It's okay.

1172
01:21:21,750 --> 01:21:24,241
Uh, we have a situation
out here...

1173
01:21:24,319 --> 01:21:26,253
that needs attention.

1174
01:21:30,859 --> 01:21:33,293
I've been trying
to warn you guys about this...

1175
01:21:33,361 --> 01:21:35,295
and now we have
absolutely zero supplies.

1176
01:21:35,363 --> 01:21:37,797
There's an older gentlemen over there.
He has a sprained shoulder.

1177
01:21:37,866 --> 01:21:41,461
I don't have any slings.
I had to wrap his arm in his own belt.

1178
01:21:41,536 --> 01:21:44,903
We have no iodine. We don't even
have any gauze, for God's sake.

1179
01:21:46,274 --> 01:21:49,539
There's an entire supply room
at the hospital.

1180
01:21:49,611 --> 01:21:53,103
That couldn't possibly be because
those supplies belong to the hospital.

1181
01:21:53,181 --> 01:21:55,615
No.
That's too obvious.

1182
01:21:57,085 --> 01:22:01,522
Come on.
I need your feet, and I want your body.

1183
01:22:01,589 --> 01:22:03,614
- Come on.
- Bye.

1184
01:22:03,692 --> 01:22:05,319
Behave.

1185
01:22:05,393 --> 01:22:08,453
- Would you hurry, please?
This stuff is crushing me.
- Quiet. You're a corpse.

1186
01:22:08,530 --> 01:22:10,464
Ow!
Shh!

1187
01:22:10,532 --> 01:22:12,466
- Ow!
- Damn it!

1188
01:22:12,534 --> 01:22:16,129
- Watch it!
- Quiet. Shut up!

1189
01:22:56,188 --> 01:23:00,215
Yeah, uh, this is Larry.

1190
01:23:00,292 --> 01:23:03,921
Uh, I was wondering i-if
somebody could come over.

1191
01:23:03,995 --> 01:23:05,929
Uh--

1192
01:23:06,998 --> 01:23:09,091
I'm not doin' too well.
Um--

1193
01:23:10,802 --> 01:23:14,499
I was, I was-- I-lt would help
if I could talk to somebody.

1194
01:23:14,573 --> 01:23:17,371
Uh... okay.

1195
01:23:46,805 --> 01:23:48,739
Hello?

1196
01:23:59,885 --> 01:24:01,819
Larry?

1197
01:24:26,545 --> 01:24:28,479
Larry?

1198
01:24:30,482 --> 01:24:32,416
Are you okay?

1199
01:24:35,153 --> 01:24:39,112
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I'm fine. I'm fine.

1200
01:24:41,193 --> 01:24:44,754
- I didn't know you could play.
You sound wonderful.
- Thank you.

1201
01:24:44,830 --> 01:24:48,197
And this house-- it's amazing.
Is it yours?

1202
01:24:49,334 --> 01:24:51,768
It's my father's.
He left it to me.

1203
01:24:53,572 --> 01:24:55,506
Here.
Let me take your jacket.

1204
01:24:57,576 --> 01:24:59,510
Sure.

1205
01:25:02,180 --> 01:25:05,308
- You okay?
- Yeah. I'm fine. I'm fine.

1206
01:25:06,885 --> 01:25:09,319
Uh, come in.
Come in.

1207
01:25:10,288 --> 01:25:12,222
Thanks.

1208
01:25:14,292 --> 01:25:18,319
I really can't stay very long.
I just wanted to see how you were doing.

1209
01:25:19,564 --> 01:25:22,124
Yeah, you're right.

1210
01:25:24,903 --> 01:25:26,996
No, we don't wanna be late.

1211
01:25:40,285 --> 01:25:42,515
Patch.

1212
01:25:42,587 --> 01:25:44,646
- Oh.
- You just got a telephone call.

1213
01:25:44,723 --> 01:25:47,851
Dean Anderson wants to see you
in his office immediately.

1214
01:25:47,926 --> 01:25:52,829
- Oh, no. Walcott found out
about our borrowed supplies.
- We're dead.

1215
01:25:52,898 --> 01:25:55,230
Ye of little faith.

1216
01:26:03,708 --> 01:26:07,474
Dean Anderson, I know what this is
all about, and I assure you, sir--

1217
01:26:07,546 --> 01:26:09,480
Sit down.

1218
01:26:16,021 --> 01:26:18,455
Something happened last night.

1219
01:26:20,859 --> 01:26:22,793
Carin Fisher was murdered.

1220
01:26:25,597 --> 01:26:27,963
She was with Lawrence Silver.

1221
01:26:29,601 --> 01:26:32,729
There was a shotgun involved,
and then he turned the gun on himself.

1222
01:26:34,105 --> 01:26:37,632
Jesus Christ, Patch, I'm sorry.
I know she was a friend.

1223
01:26:38,710 --> 01:26:42,544
If there's, um,
anything I can do--

1224
01:26:47,018 --> 01:26:48,952
Hell of a deal.

1225
01:26:54,859 --> 01:26:57,953
"Into Your hands, O Merciful Savior...

1226
01:26:58,029 --> 01:27:00,862
we commend
Your servant Carin.

1227
01:27:00,932 --> 01:27:03,958
Receive her into the arms
of Your mercy,

1228
01:27:04,035 --> 01:27:07,493
into the blessed rest
of everlasting peace,

1229
01:27:07,572 --> 01:27:13,135
and into the glorious company
of the saints... on high."

1230
01:27:13,211 --> 01:27:15,645
Amen.

1231
01:28:10,268 --> 01:28:12,702
Told you I'd finish it
some other time.

1232
01:28:14,439 --> 01:28:16,373
Guess now's okay.

1233
01:28:19,911 --> 01:28:24,678
"I love you without knowing
how... or when...

1234
01:28:24,749 --> 01:28:26,683
or from where.

1235
01:28:29,087 --> 01:28:34,115
I love you straightforwardly,
without complexities or pride.

1236
01:28:34,192 --> 01:28:37,923
I love you because I know
no other way than this.

1237
01:28:40,231 --> 01:28:42,529
So close...

1238
01:28:42,600 --> 01:28:45,763
that your hand on my chest
is my hand.

1239
01:28:47,505 --> 01:28:50,303
So close
that when you close your eyes...

1240
01:28:51,876 --> 01:28:53,867
I fall asleep."

1241
01:29:06,091 --> 01:29:08,753
I'm sorry, honey! I'm sorry!

1242
01:29:18,703 --> 01:29:21,103
We can't disband.
You know that, right?

1243
01:29:22,540 --> 01:29:24,872
What about our patients?
What do we tell them?

1244
01:29:24,943 --> 01:29:27,639
They'll manage.
They managed before.

1245
01:29:27,712 --> 01:29:30,510
- I refuse to quit.
- Good.

1246
01:29:30,582 --> 01:29:33,176
God, you're being
so self-indulgent.

1247
01:29:33,251 --> 01:29:38,416
This has been your vision,
but we all built this place
and it belongs to all of us.

1248
01:29:38,490 --> 01:29:40,924
Carin will always remain
within these walls.

1249
01:29:40,992 --> 01:29:44,086
If you walk away from that,
if you let that all die--

1250
01:29:46,364 --> 01:29:48,832
I've dedicated
every spare moment I have...

1251
01:29:48,900 --> 01:29:53,269
to assisting you in what I believe
is a pure and a good purpose.

1252
01:29:53,338 --> 01:29:56,501
Quitting is not going
to help you get through this.

1253
01:29:56,574 --> 01:29:58,633
- You've always told us--
- Stop it!

1254
01:29:58,710 --> 01:30:01,077
I've always told you what?

1255
01:30:01,211 --> 01:30:04,612
People are good.
Trust people? Ha!

1256
01:30:04,681 --> 01:30:06,615
You know, Truman...

1257
01:30:06,683 --> 01:30:10,619
in all of God's creations, only
human beings kill their own species.

1258
01:30:10,687 --> 01:30:12,951
There's a fun fact
for your final exam.

1259
01:30:14,190 --> 01:30:18,024
Carin's death cannot make
helping people wrong.

1260
01:30:18,094 --> 01:30:20,722
She saw it coming.

1261
01:30:20,797 --> 01:30:24,460
She knew there was something dangerous
about Larry. I didn't see it.

1262
01:30:24,534 --> 01:30:26,968
Patch,
why are you being like this?

1263
01:30:27,037 --> 01:30:30,438
Because I killed her,
Truman.

1264
01:30:31,574 --> 01:30:34,543
I taught her the medicine
that killed her.

1265
01:30:42,419 --> 01:30:45,354
She'd still be here
if I hadn't met her.

1266
01:31:03,306 --> 01:31:05,240
You can't leave.

1267
01:31:08,378 --> 01:31:13,213
If what you say is true, looks like
I'm defying the laws of possibility.

1268
01:31:16,219 --> 01:31:18,153
What are you doing?

1269
01:31:19,489 --> 01:31:22,322
Oh, I can't leave
until you beat me, is that it?

1270
01:31:22,392 --> 01:31:24,451
Okay. I surrender.
You're number one.

1271
01:31:24,527 --> 01:31:28,327
You're the top student in the class.
You're smarter than me.

1272
01:31:28,398 --> 01:31:31,231
Is that what you want to hear?
Now can I leave?

1273
01:31:35,405 --> 01:31:38,602
You know Mrs. Kennedy
in 212?

1274
01:31:38,675 --> 01:31:40,609
She doesn't eat.

1275
01:31:40,677 --> 01:31:44,545
I visited her room every day
for the last three weeks.

1276
01:31:44,614 --> 01:31:46,548
I can't get her to eat.

1277
01:31:48,451 --> 01:31:51,716
Now, I know everything
there is to know about medicine.

1278
01:31:51,788 --> 01:31:53,722
I've studied relentlessly.

1279
01:31:53,790 --> 01:31:58,557
I guarantee you I can outdo,
outdiagnose any attending
and surgeon in this hospital.

1280
01:32:02,732 --> 01:32:04,666
But I can't make her eat.

1281
01:32:10,507 --> 01:32:13,135
You have a gift.

1282
01:32:13,209 --> 01:32:16,576
You have a way with people.

1283
01:32:16,646 --> 01:32:19,080
You know, they like you.

1284
01:32:21,785 --> 01:32:24,720
And if you leave,
I can't learn this way.

1285
01:32:41,438 --> 01:32:43,372
So what now, huh?

1286
01:32:44,974 --> 01:32:47,238
What do You want from me?

1287
01:32:53,416 --> 01:32:55,850
Yeah, I could do it.

1288
01:32:55,919 --> 01:32:58,854
We both know
You wouldn't stop me.

1289
01:33:03,193 --> 01:33:06,128
So answer me, please.

1290
01:33:06,196 --> 01:33:08,630
Tell me what You're doing.

1291
01:33:13,403 --> 01:33:15,837
Okay,
let's look at the logic.

1292
01:33:17,607 --> 01:33:19,632
You create man.

1293
01:33:19,709 --> 01:33:23,577
Man suffers enormous amounts
of pain.

1294
01:33:23,646 --> 01:33:27,013
Man dies.

1295
01:33:27,083 --> 01:33:31,144
Maybe You should have had just
a few more brainstorming sessions...

1296
01:33:31,221 --> 01:33:33,155
prior to Creation.

1297
01:33:34,757 --> 01:33:38,284
You rested
on the seventh day.

1298
01:33:38,361 --> 01:33:41,922
Maybe You should have spent
that day on compassion.

1299
01:33:51,040 --> 01:33:52,974
You know what?

1300
01:33:55,578 --> 01:33:57,512
You're not worth it.

1301
01:35:12,989 --> 01:35:15,321
Do you still want help
with Mrs. Kennedy?

1302
01:35:20,964 --> 01:35:23,364
Hey, Aggie.

1303
01:35:23,433 --> 01:35:25,867
We have a special
surprise for you.

1304
01:35:42,518 --> 01:35:46,352
Surprise!

1305
01:35:48,691 --> 01:35:51,159
Benvenuto, Aggie!

1306
01:35:51,227 --> 01:35:53,661
Aggie! Aggie!

1307
01:35:57,166 --> 01:35:59,134
Grab ahold, Aggie!

1308
01:35:59,202 --> 01:36:00,863
There you go.
Oh!

1309
01:36:00,937 --> 01:36:04,338
- Oh.
- Come on in, Aggie.!

1310
01:36:04,407 --> 01:36:06,341
Y-Yes.

1311
01:36:27,263 --> 01:36:29,857
Pasta angels, Aggie! Pasta angels!

1312
01:36:41,144 --> 01:36:43,408
Patch?

1313
01:36:43,479 --> 01:36:46,937
Hey. I'm supposed
to give you this.

1314
01:37:02,932 --> 01:37:06,197
- You turn around
and walk right out of here.
- Why?

1315
01:37:06,269 --> 01:37:09,170
Everything will be delineated
in your letter of dismissal.

1316
01:37:09,238 --> 01:37:11,900
- Why?
- You don't fit in.

1317
01:37:11,974 --> 01:37:13,999
There are standards
and codes.

1318
01:37:14,077 --> 01:37:17,171
You make the patients and everyone else
around you uncomfortable.

1319
01:37:17,246 --> 01:37:21,182
- I make you uncomfortable.
- Well, you can make this into
a personal issue if you'd like.

1320
01:37:21,250 --> 01:37:24,413
But the reality is,
you are not cut out to be a physician.

1321
01:37:24,487 --> 01:37:27,422
- And it is my responsibility--
- Responsibility?

1322
01:37:27,490 --> 01:37:31,620
You have one responsibility-- to be
a dick-head. How hard can that be?

1323
01:37:31,694 --> 01:37:35,221
All you have to do is make sure
your head is a dick
and it's attached to your neck.

1324
01:37:35,298 --> 01:37:37,493
- You leave immediately.
- I wanna see my records.

1325
01:37:37,567 --> 01:37:40,058
They're confidential.

1326
01:37:40,136 --> 01:37:42,001
Only the staff--

1327
01:37:47,744 --> 01:37:49,678
Please,
you have to have permission.

1328
01:37:49,746 --> 01:37:52,909
You can't just go in there
and take your own file!

1329
01:37:52,982 --> 01:37:54,916
Your marks are basically perfect.

1330
01:37:54,984 --> 01:37:58,442
You've gotta be near
the top of the class.

1331
01:37:58,521 --> 01:38:01,957
Look at this.
"Excessive happiness."

1332
01:38:02,024 --> 01:38:04,925
- Actually says
you're excessively happy?
- Mm-hmm.

1333
01:38:04,994 --> 01:38:07,554
And what does that mean?
lsn't that good?

1334
01:38:07,630 --> 01:38:11,726
- I gotta fight this.
- What can we do?

1335
01:38:11,801 --> 01:38:16,500
Dean Walcott seems thoroughly committed
to your not ever becoming a doctor.

1336
01:38:16,572 --> 01:38:19,063
Even Dean Anderson
signed this.

1337
01:38:20,843 --> 01:38:23,004
Nah, I'm screwed.

1338
01:38:23,079 --> 01:38:25,047
I like this.

1339
01:38:26,182 --> 01:38:28,116
You need my help.

1340
01:38:28,184 --> 01:38:30,550
I prefer to think
I'm using you.

1341
01:38:31,621 --> 01:38:33,555
- You have one shot.
- Mm-hmm.

1342
01:38:33,623 --> 01:38:36,592
- You'd have to appeal
to the state medical board.
- How does that work?

1343
01:38:36,659 --> 01:38:39,628
You claim that a prejudice
and injustice has occurred.

1344
01:38:39,695 --> 01:38:42,926
- They'll be worried about a suit.
They'll have to investigate.
- Then what?

1345
01:38:42,999 --> 01:38:45,968
- They'll review your grades,
which is good--
- Mm-hmm.

1346
01:38:46,035 --> 01:38:47,969
you're almost
top of the class--

1347
01:38:48,037 --> 01:38:49,971
but mostly your behavior.

1348
01:38:51,574 --> 01:38:54,099
Do you have any idea
what Walcott has on you?

1349
01:38:55,745 --> 01:38:57,679
How'd you get these?

1350
01:38:57,747 --> 01:39:00,580
Don't ask.

1351
01:39:00,650 --> 01:39:04,609
They can't prevent me
from graduating because of
a personality clash, can they?

1352
01:39:04,687 --> 01:39:06,951
Hunter, this is a medical institution
you're dealing with.

1353
01:39:07,023 --> 01:39:08,957
They draw their own law.

1354
01:39:09,025 --> 01:39:12,222
You'll have to get their focus
on your high marks and off of this.

1355
01:39:12,295 --> 01:39:14,229
I'm screwed, aren't l?

1356
01:39:15,798 --> 01:39:17,732
You're almost a doctor.

1357
01:39:17,800 --> 01:39:20,667
They're a panel of doctors.

1358
01:39:20,736 --> 01:39:24,467
Just think of them as your peers...
and return these.

1359
01:39:24,540 --> 01:39:26,371
Yeah.

1360
01:39:26,442 --> 01:39:29,878
And get a suit.

1361
01:39:54,270 --> 01:39:56,204
Hunter Adams.

1362
01:39:58,641 --> 01:40:01,906
You've been accused of
practicing medicine without a license.

1363
01:40:01,978 --> 01:40:04,276
That's a very
grave charge, son.

1364
01:40:04,347 --> 01:40:08,943
Are you aware that it's unlawful
to practice medicine without
a medical license?

1365
01:40:09,018 --> 01:40:10,679
Yes, sir, I am.

1366
01:40:10,753 --> 01:40:14,587
Are you aware that running a medical
clinic without the proper licensing...

1367
01:40:14,657 --> 01:40:16,921
can place both you
and the public...

1368
01:40:16,993 --> 01:40:19,086
in a great deal of danger?

1369
01:40:19,161 --> 01:40:21,129
Is a home a clinic, sir?

1370
01:40:21,197 --> 01:40:24,325
If you are admitting patients
and treating them...

1371
01:40:24,400 --> 01:40:26,868
physical location
is irrelevant.

1372
01:40:26,936 --> 01:40:30,702
Sir, will you define
treatment for me?

1373
01:40:30,773 --> 01:40:35,540
Yes. Treatment would be defined
as the care of a patient
seeking medical attention.

1374
01:40:36,746 --> 01:40:40,045
Have you been treating patients,
Mr. Adams?

1375
01:40:40,116 --> 01:40:43,108
I live with several people.
They come and go as they please.

1376
01:40:43,185 --> 01:40:45,119
I offer them
whatever help I can.

1377
01:40:45,187 --> 01:40:47,246
Mr. Adams...

1378
01:40:47,323 --> 01:40:51,419
have you or have you not
been treating patients at your ranch?

1379
01:40:53,462 --> 01:40:56,898
Everyone who comes to the ranch
is a patient, yes.

1380
01:40:59,902 --> 01:41:03,167
And every person who comes
to the ranch is also a doctor.

1381
01:41:05,174 --> 01:41:07,404
I'm sorry?

1382
01:41:07,476 --> 01:41:10,001
Every person who comes
to the ranch is in need...

1383
01:41:10,079 --> 01:41:12,809
of some form of physical
or mental help.

1384
01:41:12,882 --> 01:41:14,816
They're patients.

1385
01:41:14,884 --> 01:41:20,254
But also every person who comes
to the ranch is in charge of
taking care of someone else--

1386
01:41:20,322 --> 01:41:22,290
whether it's cooking for them,
cleaning them...

1387
01:41:22,358 --> 01:41:25,259
or even as simple a task
as listening.

1388
01:41:25,327 --> 01:41:27,261
That makes them doctors.

1389
01:41:27,329 --> 01:41:32,631
I use that term broadly, but is not a
doctor someone who helps someone else?

1390
01:41:32,701 --> 01:41:36,831
When did the term "doctor" get
treated with such reverence, as,
"Right this way, Doctor Smith"...

1391
01:41:36,906 --> 01:41:39,841
or, "Excuse me, Dr. Scholl,
what wonderful footpads"...

1392
01:41:39,909 --> 01:41:43,606
or, "Pardon me, Dr. Patterson,
but your flatulence has no odor"?

1393
01:41:46,348 --> 01:41:49,909
At what point in history
did a doctor become more...

1394
01:41:49,985 --> 01:41:54,217
than a trusted and learned friend
who visited and treated the ill?

1395
01:41:54,290 --> 01:41:57,453
Now, you ask me if
I've been practicing medicine.

1396
01:41:57,526 --> 01:42:00,620
Well, if this means opening
your door to those in need--

1397
01:42:00,696 --> 01:42:03,062
those in pain--

1398
01:42:03,132 --> 01:42:08,536
caring for them, listening
to them, applying a cold cloth
until a fever breaks--

1399
01:42:08,604 --> 01:42:10,902
if this is practicing medicine,
if this is treating a patient...

1400
01:42:10,973 --> 01:42:13,533
then I am guilty
as charged, sir.

1401
01:42:13,609 --> 01:42:17,204
Did you consider the ramifications
of your actions?

1402
01:42:17,279 --> 01:42:19,577
What if one of your patients
had died?

1403
01:42:19,648 --> 01:42:21,980
What's wrong
with death, sir?

1404
01:42:22,051 --> 01:42:24,519
What are we so mortally
afraid of?

1405
01:42:24,587 --> 01:42:27,852
Why can't we treat death with
a certain amount of humanity
and dignity and decency...

1406
01:42:27,923 --> 01:42:30,551
and, God forbid,
maybe even humor?

1407
01:42:30,626 --> 01:42:32,560
Death is not the enemy,
gentlemen.

1408
01:42:32,628 --> 01:42:35,563
If we're gonna fight a disease,
let's fight one of the most
terrible diseases of all--

1409
01:42:35,631 --> 01:42:37,565
indifference.

1410
01:42:37,633 --> 01:42:41,694
Now, I've sat in your schools and heard
people lecture on transference...

1411
01:42:41,770 --> 01:42:43,704
and professional distance.

1412
01:42:43,772 --> 01:42:46,263
Transference
is inevitable, sir.

1413
01:42:46,342 --> 01:42:48,867
Every human being
has an impact on another.

1414
01:42:48,944 --> 01:42:52,402
Why don't we want that in
a patient/doctor relationship?

1415
01:42:52,481 --> 01:42:56,884
That's why I've listened to your
teachings, and I believe they're wrong.

1416
01:42:56,952 --> 01:43:00,854
A doctor's mission should be
not just to prevent death...

1417
01:43:00,923 --> 01:43:03,050
but also to improve
the quality of life.

1418
01:43:03,125 --> 01:43:06,288
That's why you treat a disease,
you win, you lose.

1419
01:43:06,362 --> 01:43:11,595
You treat a person, I guarantee you,
you win, no matter what the outcome.

1420
01:43:13,569 --> 01:43:17,061
Now here today, this room
is full of medical students.

1421
01:43:17,139 --> 01:43:21,838
Don't let them anesthetize you.
Don't let them numb you out
to the miracle of life.

1422
01:43:21,911 --> 01:43:25,403
Always live in awe of the
glorious mechanism of the human body.

1423
01:43:25,481 --> 01:43:28,678
Let that be the focus of your studies
and not a quest for grades...

1424
01:43:28,751 --> 01:43:31,686
which'll give you no idea what kind
of doctor you will become.

1425
01:43:31,754 --> 01:43:33,847
Please try and address the board.

1426
01:43:33,923 --> 01:43:36,983
Don't wait till you're on the ward
to get your humanity back.

1427
01:43:37,059 --> 01:43:39,527
Start your interviewing skills.
Start talking to strangers.

1428
01:43:39,595 --> 01:43:42,291
Talk to your friends,
Talk to wrong numbers, everyone.

1429
01:43:42,364 --> 01:43:45,231
- Mr. Adams!
- And cultivate friendships...

1430
01:43:45,301 --> 01:43:48,600
with those amazing people in the back of
the room-- nurses that could teach you.

1431
01:43:48,671 --> 01:43:51,799
They've been with people every day.
They wade through blood and shit.

1432
01:43:51,874 --> 01:43:55,833
They have a wealth of knowledge,
and so do the professors you respect--

1433
01:43:55,911 --> 01:43:58,141
the ones who are not dead
from the heart up.

1434
01:43:58,214 --> 01:44:02,082
- Share their compassion.
Let that be contagious.
- Mr. Adams.

1435
01:44:02,151 --> 01:44:04,585
I demand that you turn
and address the board.

1436
01:44:04,653 --> 01:44:07,588
Sir, I want to be a doctor
with all my heart.

1437
01:44:20,069 --> 01:44:23,334
I wanted to become a doctor
so I could serve others...

1438
01:44:23,405 --> 01:44:25,873
and because of that
I've lost everything...

1439
01:44:25,941 --> 01:44:28,637
but I've also
gained everything.

1440
01:44:28,711 --> 01:44:32,875
I've shared the lives of patients
and staff members at the hospital.

1441
01:44:32,948 --> 01:44:35,883
I've laughed with them.
I've cried with them.

1442
01:44:37,253 --> 01:44:39,687
This is what I want to do
with my life.

1443
01:44:42,191 --> 01:44:44,955
And as God is my witness...

1444
01:44:45,027 --> 01:44:47,461
no matter what your decision
today, sir...

1445
01:44:47,529 --> 01:44:52,466
I will still become the best damn doctor
the world has ever seen.

1446
01:44:54,670 --> 01:44:57,730
Now you have the ability
to prevent me from graduating.

1447
01:44:57,806 --> 01:45:02,004
You can keep me from getting
the title and the white coat.

1448
01:45:02,077 --> 01:45:04,341
But you can't control
my spirit, gentlemen.

1449
01:45:04,413 --> 01:45:08,179
You can't keep me from learning.
You can't keep me from studying.

1450
01:45:08,250 --> 01:45:11,378
So you have a choice-- you could
have me as a professional colleague...

1451
01:45:11,453 --> 01:45:13,387
passionate...

1452
01:45:13,455 --> 01:45:16,754
or you can have me as an
outspoken outsider, still adamant.

1453
01:45:16,825 --> 01:45:19,885
Either way, I'll probably
still be viewed as a thorn.

1454
01:45:19,962 --> 01:45:22,260
But I promise you one thing.

1455
01:45:22,331 --> 01:45:24,993
I am a thorn
that will not go away.

1456
01:45:28,003 --> 01:45:29,994
Is that all?

1457
01:45:32,308 --> 01:45:34,242
I hope not, sir.

1458
01:45:37,379 --> 01:45:39,574
We will adjourn briefly.

1459
01:46:25,327 --> 01:46:27,261
Thank you.

1460
01:46:59,341 --> 01:47:01,070
Hunter Adams.

1461
01:47:05,848 --> 01:47:09,614
We find your methods
less than appealing.

1462
01:47:10,986 --> 01:47:13,921
Your appearance and your demeanor
do not reflect...

1463
01:47:13,989 --> 01:47:15,923
what we believe
is necessary...

1464
01:47:15,991 --> 01:47:19,085
to earn a patient's trust
and respect.

1465
01:47:20,562 --> 01:47:24,293
You openly accuse us of adhering
to time-honored practices...

1466
01:47:24,366 --> 01:47:29,167
that for years have been the backbone
of the entire medical institution.

1467
01:47:31,707 --> 01:47:33,868
However...

1468
01:47:33,943 --> 01:47:36,070
we find no fault
in your attempts...

1469
01:47:36,145 --> 01:47:39,603
to improve the quality of life
around you.

1470
01:47:40,849 --> 01:47:43,215
We find no fault
in your desire...

1471
01:47:43,285 --> 01:47:46,277
to expand upon existing
medical practices...

1472
01:47:46,355 --> 01:47:48,289
and theories.

1473
01:47:48,357 --> 01:47:51,986
We applaud your love
of the patient.

1474
01:47:52,061 --> 01:47:54,393
Your grades are among
the highest in your class...

1475
01:47:54,463 --> 01:47:57,523
and, therefore, we find
no merit in the decision...

1476
01:47:57,599 --> 01:48:00,500
to block your graduation
from medical school.

1477
01:48:07,476 --> 01:48:12,140
Now, along with your crass
and disdainful behavior...

1478
01:48:12,214 --> 01:48:15,377
you carry with you a flame...

1479
01:48:15,451 --> 01:48:17,385
which one could only hope...

1480
01:48:17,453 --> 01:48:20,479
would spread through
the medical profession like a brushfire.

1481
01:48:21,957 --> 01:48:23,891
And, uh, Dean Walcott...

1482
01:48:23,959 --> 01:48:27,053
in the future,
I think matters like this...

1483
01:48:27,129 --> 01:48:30,895
could best be solved if you yourself
would practice a little...

1484
01:48:30,966 --> 01:48:34,163
"excessive happiness."

1485
01:49:01,430 --> 01:49:03,591
Well, today you go...

1486
01:49:03,665 --> 01:49:07,294
from being students in a class
to being members of a class--

1487
01:49:07,369 --> 01:49:10,099
a very select class.

1488
01:49:10,172 --> 01:49:13,835
You face the future
with your heads held high...

1489
01:49:13,909 --> 01:49:16,707
because you are now...
doctors.

1490
01:49:26,555 --> 01:49:28,648
Dr. Michael Ames.

1491
01:49:34,229 --> 01:49:37,221
Dr. Doris Ackerman

1492
01:49:40,936 --> 01:49:43,666
Dr. Hunter "Patch" Adams.

1493
01:49:48,177 --> 01:49:50,338
Yea, Patch!

1494
01:49:53,916 --> 01:49:57,010
Well, I'm happy to see
you've finally decided to conform.

1495
01:49:57,086 --> 01:49:59,486
More than you know, sir.
