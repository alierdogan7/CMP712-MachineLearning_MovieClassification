Let the river run

Let all the dreamers wake the nation

11
00:01:17,911 --> 00:01:26,002
Come the New Jerusalem

12
00:01:28,505 --> 00:01:32,508
Silver cities rise

13
00:01:32,593 --> 00:01:35,344
The morning lights

14
00:01:35,429 --> 00:01:38,765
The streets
that lead them

15
00:01:38,849 --> 00:01:40,850
And sirens

16
00:01:40,934 --> 00:01:43,019
Call them on

17
00:01:43,103 --> 00:01:47,356
With a song

18
00:01:49,443 --> 00:01:54,864
It's asking
for the taking

19
00:01:54,948 --> 00:02:00,203
Trembling, shaking

20
00:02:00,287 --> 00:02:05,041
Oh, my heart is aching

21
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:06,709
We're coming to the edge

22
00:02:06,794 --> 00:02:08,211
Running on the water

23
00:02:08,295 --> 00:02:11,047
Coming through the fog,
your sons and daughters

24
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:15,218
We, the great and small

25
00:02:15,302 --> 00:02:17,887
Stand on a star

26
00:02:17,971 --> 00:02:23,559
And blaze a trail
of desire...

27
00:02:23,644 --> 00:02:29,065
...Tess,
happy birthday to you

28
00:02:32,486 --> 00:02:34,403
Did you make a wish?

29
00:02:34,905 --> 00:02:37,073
Yeah.

30
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:38,574
Come run with me now

31
00:02:38,659 --> 00:02:40,952
The sky is the color
of blue

32
00:02:41,036 --> 00:02:43,204
You've never even seen
in the eyes of your lover

33
00:02:43,288 --> 00:02:47,583
Oh, my heart is aching

34
00:02:47,668 --> 00:02:49,085
We're coming to the edge

35
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:50,920
Running on the water

36
00:02:51,004 --> 00:02:53,756
Coming through the fog,
your sons and daughters

37
00:02:53,841 --> 00:02:56,050
Let the river run

38
00:02:57,678 --> 00:03:01,347
Let all the dreamers
wake...

39
00:03:01,431 --> 00:03:03,683
No lunch.
I got speech class.

40
00:03:03,767 --> 00:03:05,268
What do you need
speech class for?

41
00:03:05,352 --> 00:03:06,769
You talk fine.

42
00:03:08,605 --> 00:03:10,731
I'll pick you up at 5:00.
We'll ride back together.

43
00:03:10,816 --> 00:03:13,818
I can't. I've got emerging market
seminar at 5:30.

44
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:15,862
It's your birthday.

45
00:03:15,946 --> 00:03:18,614
Can't they emerge without you
just this once?

46
00:03:19,283 --> 00:03:20,992
What time is
my surprise party?

47
00:03:21,076 --> 00:03:22,159
What?

48
00:03:22,244 --> 00:03:23,578
Come on.

49
00:03:23,662 --> 00:03:26,372
I'm supposed to
have you home at 7:00.

50
00:03:26,456 --> 00:03:29,417
I'll cut out early
and be home at 7:15.

51
00:03:29,501 --> 00:03:30,543
All right.

52
00:03:30,627 --> 00:03:32,003
Thank you very much.

53
00:03:35,966 --> 00:03:40,303
Let the river run

54
00:03:40,387 --> 00:03:46,642
Let all the dreamers
wake the nation

55
00:03:46,727 --> 00:03:49,687
Come the New...

56
00:03:49,771 --> 00:03:51,147
Hi, Tess.

57
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:52,481
Morning.

58
00:03:52,566 --> 00:03:56,152
Jerusalem

59
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:57,653
Morning, Tess.

60
00:03:57,738 --> 00:03:58,988
Morning.

61
00:03:59,072 --> 00:04:00,197
Hello, Tess.

62
00:04:00,282 --> 00:04:01,449
Hi.

63
00:04:01,533 --> 00:04:02,658
I've got
a little secret

64
00:04:02,743 --> 00:04:04,285
I want to tell you.

65
00:04:04,536 --> 00:04:06,162
[Telephone Rings]

66
00:04:07,956 --> 00:04:09,165
[ring]

67
00:04:11,585 --> 00:04:13,502
Mr. Turkel's line.

68
00:04:14,004 --> 00:04:16,672
Um... Who's calling, please?

69
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:20,635
Um... Hold on a moment.

70
00:04:20,719 --> 00:04:22,386
Mr. Lutz.

71
00:04:25,515 --> 00:04:27,892
Um... Hold on
a second, all right?

72
00:04:27,976 --> 00:04:30,478
I wouldn't
do that to you,

73
00:04:30,562 --> 00:04:32,813
so relax and tell me
how many you want.

74
00:04:34,858 --> 00:04:35,900
[Knocking]

75
00:04:35,984 --> 00:04:37,360
Mr. Turkel?

76
00:04:37,945 --> 00:04:39,362
Mr. Turkel!

77
00:04:39,446 --> 00:04:40,488
Huh?

78
00:04:40,572 --> 00:04:42,198
Um... Mr. Alagesh...

79
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:44,742
Hi.

80
00:04:44,826 --> 00:04:47,286
Mr. Alagesh is real
anxious to talk to you.

81
00:04:47,371 --> 00:04:49,330
Couldn't you
get him to hold?

82
00:04:49,414 --> 00:04:50,748
You got him
in Denatech,

83
00:04:50,832 --> 00:04:52,208
the one I said
go short on,

84
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:54,710
and it's fine, but he don't want
to hear it from a secretary.

85
00:04:54,795 --> 00:04:57,964
- There's no paper.
- What?

86
00:04:58,048 --> 00:05:01,842
There is no goddamn paper.
Get me some.

87
00:05:10,018 --> 00:05:11,268
Thanks.

88
00:05:11,478 --> 00:05:12,895
You're very kind.

89
00:05:16,191 --> 00:05:17,441
Oh!

90
00:05:21,071 --> 00:05:23,155
He's short
on Denatech at 18,

91
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:25,241
and he'll be
right here.

92
00:05:41,383 --> 00:05:43,009
You see
Denatech closing?

93
00:05:43,093 --> 00:05:46,303
171/8. Come Monday,
I bet it's 16.

94
00:05:46,638 --> 00:05:47,847
How you figure?

95
00:05:48,015 --> 00:05:50,766
They went public at 23
with one product...

96
00:05:50,851 --> 00:05:52,435
plaque-removing
mouthwash.

97
00:05:53,228 --> 00:05:55,062
You get this glob
of plaque

98
00:05:55,147 --> 00:05:56,355
you got to spit out.

99
00:05:56,606 --> 00:05:59,191
No one ever got rich

100
00:05:59,276 --> 00:06:02,445
overestimating what
people want to taste.

101
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:04,822
Maybe.

102
00:06:06,116 --> 00:06:07,491
Before I run, Tess,

103
00:06:07,576 --> 00:06:10,619
I have good news
and bad news.

104
00:06:11,121 --> 00:06:12,705
The straight shot,
Tessie, is,

105
00:06:12,789 --> 00:06:16,000
they turned you down
for the entree program again.

106
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:18,461
Why?

107
00:06:18,545 --> 00:06:19,795
Did all we could,
Tessie.

108
00:06:20,047 --> 00:06:22,089
You're up against
Harvard graduates.

109
00:06:22,174 --> 00:06:23,632
What do you got?

110
00:06:23,717 --> 00:06:25,134
Some night school,

111
00:06:25,218 --> 00:06:26,886
some secretarial time
on your sheet?

112
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:29,138
Christians
and lions, Tess.

113
00:06:30,307 --> 00:06:31,640
The good news?

114
00:06:31,767 --> 00:06:33,142
Dave has a friend.

115
00:06:33,518 --> 00:06:35,478
Bob in Arbitrage.

116
00:06:35,562 --> 00:06:37,938
They're looking for
hungry down there.

117
00:06:38,774 --> 00:06:39,815
Really?

118
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:41,817
Hungry's the name of
the game down there.

119
00:06:42,277 --> 00:06:45,112
Bob's looking for a new assistant.
He wants to meet you for a drink.

120
00:06:45,947 --> 00:06:47,490
This isn't
another setup?

121
00:06:48,158 --> 00:06:49,200
Sh...

122
00:06:49,993 --> 00:06:51,535
Do I look
like a pimp?

123
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,417
Bob says he's looking
for hungry,

124
00:06:58,502 --> 00:06:59,752
I think to
myself, "Tess."

125
00:06:59,836 --> 00:07:01,128
The rest
is up to you.

126
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:03,756
Bob in Arbitrage.

127
00:07:04,216 --> 00:07:06,634
Bob Speck.
Extension 256.

128
00:07:06,718 --> 00:07:07,927
Expecting your call.

129
00:07:08,303 --> 00:07:09,804
Go get him, Tessie.

130
00:07:11,223 --> 00:07:14,391
Happy birthday to you

131
00:07:14,643 --> 00:07:17,603
- Happy birthday to you
- You should have told us!

132
00:07:18,021 --> 00:07:22,024
Happy birthday, dear Tess

133
00:07:22,359 --> 00:07:25,861
Happy birthday to you

134
00:07:26,947 --> 00:07:28,155
Thanks.

135
00:07:38,333 --> 00:07:39,542
Mick?

136
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:46,882
Ooh ooh ooh ooh

137
00:07:48,426 --> 00:07:51,679
Na na na na

138
00:07:51,763 --> 00:07:54,056
Da-a-um

139
00:07:54,724 --> 00:07:56,392
Mmm

140
00:07:57,018 --> 00:07:58,477
Surprise!

141
00:07:58,770 --> 00:08:00,229
Hey!

142
00:08:00,355 --> 00:08:01,856
Happy birthday!

143
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:03,440
Happy birthday.

144
00:08:03,525 --> 00:08:05,067
What is this?

145
00:08:14,411 --> 00:08:15,911
You look great.

146
00:08:26,798 --> 00:08:28,299
Come here.

147
00:08:30,427 --> 00:08:32,511
You know, Mick,
just once I could go

148
00:08:32,596 --> 00:08:34,805
for a sweater
or some earrings...

149
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:37,683
a present
I could wear

150
00:08:37,767 --> 00:08:39,393
outside of
this apartment.

151
00:08:52,282 --> 00:08:54,033
So...
[Clears Throat]

152
00:08:54,993 --> 00:08:57,036
is this where you
usually meet for drinks?

153
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,330
Mmm. This is a big week.
It's a super week.

154
00:08:59,414 --> 00:09:00,748
We are celebrating!

155
00:09:01,917 --> 00:09:03,334
So, Arbitrage...

156
00:09:03,793 --> 00:09:05,461
Talk about
adrenaline, huh?

157
00:09:05,962 --> 00:09:07,838
What do you think is
the most important quality...

158
00:09:07,923 --> 00:09:09,924
for a great arbitrager?

159
00:09:10,008 --> 00:09:11,675
We'll go through all that
at the hotel.

160
00:09:13,136 --> 00:09:14,345
- The hotel?
- Yeah.

161
00:09:14,429 --> 00:09:16,222
The company's suite
at the Ritz Carlton.

162
00:09:16,306 --> 00:09:18,933
When it's empty,
we boys get it on a bonus basis.

163
00:09:19,434 --> 00:09:21,185
Woo! We're going to party!

164
00:09:21,978 --> 00:09:24,855
Oh, allow me.
I'm so sorry.

165
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:26,106
Hey! Bob, please!

166
00:09:26,191 --> 00:09:28,317
I'm sorry.
I get carried away.

167
00:09:29,194 --> 00:09:30,361
Mmm...

168
00:09:30,487 --> 00:09:34,323
Arbitrage has this
"introduction-to" tape

169
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:35,449
for the business schools.

170
00:09:35,533 --> 00:09:37,660
Why don't we put it in,
and if you have questions...

171
00:09:37,827 --> 00:09:39,411
That would be great.
Thanks.

172
00:09:51,091 --> 00:09:53,676
It's the wrong tape,
unless you...

173
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,427
Bob, you're not
seriously looking

174
00:09:55,512 --> 00:09:56,845
for a new assistant,
are you?

175
00:09:57,514 --> 00:09:59,598
Well, not exactly
at this moment.

176
00:09:59,683 --> 00:10:01,392
But I'm always looking
for new blood.

177
00:10:01,476 --> 00:10:03,811
I am hungry, Bob,
but not that hungry.

178
00:10:03,895 --> 00:10:05,938
- I wouldn't put it that way.
- I would.

179
00:10:06,022 --> 00:10:08,190
Would you
pull over, please?

180
00:10:08,275 --> 00:10:09,566
What are you doing?

181
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:11,735
No.

182
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:13,070
Ha ha ha!

183
00:10:13,154 --> 00:10:14,571
Party, Bob.

184
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:26,709
Ah!

185
00:10:43,393 --> 00:10:44,852
Hello, Tess.

186
00:10:48,064 --> 00:10:49,648
You're late, Tess.

187
00:11:10,378 --> 00:11:11,879
Yo, David!

188
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:20,846
Bitch!

189
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:22,723
You got to see this
to believe it.

190
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:25,976
Hey, take it easy!

191
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:31,106
Tess, Tess, Tess...

192
00:11:31,775 --> 00:11:32,900
I know.

193
00:11:33,234 --> 00:11:34,610
You don't get ahead

194
00:11:34,694 --> 00:11:36,612
by calling your boss
a pimp.

195
00:11:37,322 --> 00:11:38,364
Well, he is.

196
00:11:39,741 --> 00:11:43,285
This is the third time
in six months

197
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:44,828
I had to place you.

198
00:11:45,246 --> 00:11:46,830
It wasn't my fault.

199
00:11:47,082 --> 00:11:48,791
Where have I
heard that before?

200
00:11:49,167 --> 00:11:51,502
Ruth, I'm 30 years old.

201
00:11:51,586 --> 00:11:53,003
Took me five years
of night school,

202
00:11:53,088 --> 00:11:55,214
but I got my degree
with honors.

203
00:11:55,298 --> 00:11:56,882
I know I could
do a job.

204
00:11:57,217 --> 00:12:00,260
You ask any
of my bosses, even Lutz,

205
00:12:00,345 --> 00:12:02,971
- if Tess McGill hasn't called a few.
- You ask 'em.

206
00:12:03,056 --> 00:12:05,307
They won't sing
your praises, Tess.

207
00:12:11,314 --> 00:12:12,981
Here's something
for you...

208
00:12:13,191 --> 00:12:15,150
Transferring down
from Boston,

209
00:12:15,944 --> 00:12:17,861
Mergers
and Acquisitions.

210
00:12:17,946 --> 00:12:19,363
Name is Parker.

211
00:12:19,447 --> 00:12:21,240
Starts Monday.

212
00:12:21,324 --> 00:12:23,409
You go home
and cool off.

213
00:12:23,493 --> 00:12:24,868
O.K.

214
00:12:24,953 --> 00:12:27,371
Tess, this is
the last time

215
00:12:27,455 --> 00:12:28,580
I can help you.

216
00:12:29,916 --> 00:12:31,500
Four strikes,
you're out.

217
00:12:37,257 --> 00:12:39,675
Hi. Tess McGill
of Katharine Parker's office.

218
00:12:40,844 --> 00:12:43,011
It's the desk
at the end of the aisle.

219
00:12:51,438 --> 00:12:53,522
Look at this.
I'm telling you...

220
00:13:02,532 --> 00:13:03,699
Hi.

221
00:13:19,424 --> 00:13:21,216
I can't believe it.

222
00:13:21,301 --> 00:13:22,759
[Elevator Bell Rings]

223
00:13:22,844 --> 00:13:24,219
Shh! Shh! Shh!

224
00:13:39,527 --> 00:13:41,195
Hi. I'm Katharine Parker.

225
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:42,738
You must be Tess.

226
00:13:42,864 --> 00:13:44,156
Hi.

227
00:13:44,657 --> 00:13:46,950
Oh, great bunny!

228
00:13:48,036 --> 00:13:50,787
I don't usually have
a bunny on my desk.

229
00:13:51,122 --> 00:13:53,415
It was my birthday
a few days ago.

230
00:13:54,584 --> 00:13:56,168
Mine's next Tuesday.
How old?

231
00:13:56,294 --> 00:13:57,336
30.

232
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:59,546
Really? I'll be 30
next Tuesday.

233
00:13:59,756 --> 00:14:01,381
We're
practically twins.

234
00:14:02,342 --> 00:14:03,717
Except
that I'm older.

235
00:14:03,801 --> 00:14:05,093
Just barely.

236
00:14:05,595 --> 00:14:07,513
I've never
worked for somebody

237
00:14:07,597 --> 00:14:09,640
who was younger
than me before,

238
00:14:09,724 --> 00:14:10,766
or for a woman.

239
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:13,268
There's a first time
for everything.

240
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:15,938
That's not gonna be
a problem, is it, Tess?

241
00:14:16,105 --> 00:14:17,314
No... no.

242
00:14:18,274 --> 00:14:20,692
Pour us a couple of coffees
and come inside.

243
00:14:20,944 --> 00:14:23,403
I'm light, no sugar.

244
00:14:29,202 --> 00:14:31,745
The stock is 38.
The tender's at 56.

245
00:14:31,829 --> 00:14:33,413
- [Knock On Door]
- Come in.

246
00:14:35,124 --> 00:14:36,917
What do we do
about that?

247
00:14:37,001 --> 00:14:39,628
I just checked my three.
What are yours?

248
00:14:41,297 --> 00:14:43,048
Uh-huh. Yeah,
I have that one.

249
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:46,301
Well, I think he's
in an underwater position.

250
00:14:46,844 --> 00:14:48,554
That's our first
and second call.

251
00:14:48,638 --> 00:14:50,430
Then we'll see
where we are.

252
00:14:51,224 --> 00:14:53,058
I'll count
the minutes. Bye.

253
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:55,477
Thanks.

254
00:14:57,564 --> 00:14:59,648
So, Tess,
a few ground rules.

255
00:15:00,316 --> 00:15:03,402
The way I look at it, you are
my link with the outside world.

256
00:15:03,486 --> 00:15:05,946
People's impression of me
starts with you.

257
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:07,489
You're tough
when it's warranted,

258
00:15:07,782 --> 00:15:11,618
accommodating when you can be,
accurate, punctual,

259
00:15:11,703 --> 00:15:13,287
and never make a promise
you can't keep.

260
00:15:13,454 --> 00:15:14,580
I'm never
on another line.

261
00:15:14,664 --> 00:15:16,164
I'm in a meeting.

262
00:15:16,457 --> 00:15:18,166
I consider us a team.

263
00:15:18,334 --> 00:15:19,918
As such,
we have a uniform...

264
00:15:20,003 --> 00:15:22,129
simple, elegant,
impeccable.

265
00:15:22,463 --> 00:15:24,548
"Dress shabbily,
they notice the dress.

266
00:15:24,632 --> 00:15:28,427
dress impeccably, they notice
the woman." Coco Chanel.

267
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:32,389
Um... How do I look?

268
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:35,559
You look terrific.

269
00:15:36,019 --> 00:15:37,811
You might want to
rethink the jewelry.

270
00:15:40,523 --> 00:15:43,358
I want your input.
I welcome ideas.

271
00:15:43,443 --> 00:15:45,360
I like to see
hard work rewarded.

272
00:15:45,486 --> 00:15:48,530
It's a two-way street on my team.
Am I making myself clear?

273
00:15:50,033 --> 00:15:51,450
Yes, Katharine.

274
00:15:54,871 --> 00:15:55,871
And call me Katharine.

275
00:15:56,831 --> 00:15:57,998
O.K.

276
00:15:58,499 --> 00:16:00,334
So, let's get
to work, shall we?

277
00:16:01,419 --> 00:16:04,338
This department's profile
last year was damn pitiful.

278
00:16:04,464 --> 00:16:06,882
Our team has got
its work cut out for it.

279
00:16:08,718 --> 00:16:09,801
O.K., thanks.

280
00:16:12,305 --> 00:16:14,556
Damn! I forgot
my pills again!

281
00:16:16,184 --> 00:16:17,684
Did you hear about

282
00:16:17,769 --> 00:16:19,311
that shot they got
in Europe?

283
00:16:19,395 --> 00:16:22,230
They give it to
the women in their arm,

284
00:16:22,315 --> 00:16:23,982
and it's good
for five years.

285
00:16:24,067 --> 00:16:26,068
The damn pills,
I'm always forgetting them.

286
00:16:29,238 --> 00:16:31,657
- I thought you might like this.
- Oh, thank you.

287
00:16:34,911 --> 00:16:37,412
Tess, would you come in
and bring a notebook?

288
00:16:38,331 --> 00:16:40,791
They've sold off the paper
and printing divisions.

289
00:16:40,875 --> 00:16:43,794
They sell distribution too,
we're talking scorched earth.

290
00:16:44,545 --> 00:16:45,629
Come on in.

291
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:49,925
Tess, this is Ginny.
Ginny, Tess.

292
00:16:52,553 --> 00:16:54,262
I'm throwing
a cocktail thing

293
00:16:54,347 --> 00:16:56,014
to introduce myself
to the department.

294
00:16:56,099 --> 00:16:57,307
Ginny has
some great ideas.

295
00:16:57,392 --> 00:16:58,475
Will you
jot them down?

296
00:16:58,559 --> 00:17:02,813
- Sure.
- The caterer is Acme Eats.

297
00:17:02,897 --> 00:17:04,439
You can get the number
from information.

298
00:17:04,524 --> 00:17:06,608
They do the usual
hors d'oeuvres and such.

299
00:17:06,693 --> 00:17:10,070
The Raging Bull
has a bartender service.

300
00:17:10,154 --> 00:17:13,573
The liquor store on Broadway
and Liberty delivers.

301
00:17:13,658 --> 00:17:15,033
Got that, Bess?

302
00:17:15,118 --> 00:17:18,286
Tess. Yeah, if that's the way
you want to go.

303
00:17:19,789 --> 00:17:20,997
You have another idea?

304
00:17:21,582 --> 00:17:24,584
I was reading in W
about dim sum,

305
00:17:24,669 --> 00:17:26,211
little Chinese
dumplings.

306
00:17:26,295 --> 00:17:28,004
A restaurant
on Mott Street

307
00:17:28,089 --> 00:17:29,339
does them for
cocktail parties.

308
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:31,967
I just love
those little dumplings.

309
00:17:32,093 --> 00:17:33,176
It might be more fun

310
00:17:33,261 --> 00:17:34,511
than the usual tidbits.

311
00:17:34,595 --> 00:17:35,929
I have it on my desk.
I could get it.

312
00:17:36,013 --> 00:17:39,099
- You read W?
- I read a lot of things.

313
00:17:39,183 --> 00:17:41,810
You never know where big ideas
could come from.

314
00:17:42,437 --> 00:17:44,354
Well, I guess
you're right,

315
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,773
if dumplings can be considered
a big idea.

316
00:17:48,526 --> 00:17:49,735
That ought to
get you started.

317
00:17:49,819 --> 00:17:51,653
Ginny, thank you
so much.

318
00:17:52,363 --> 00:17:54,614
- Back to the gold mines.
- Right.

319
00:17:55,116 --> 00:17:56,199
You'll set those up?

320
00:17:56,284 --> 00:17:57,284
Right away.

321
00:17:57,368 --> 00:17:58,410
Dim sum, Tess.

322
00:17:58,494 --> 00:18:00,495
I like it,
contribution-wise.

323
00:18:00,747 --> 00:18:01,955
Keep it up.

324
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:07,919
The chief says,
"We will respect your wish.

325
00:18:08,004 --> 00:18:09,546
"We will give you
an honorable death.

326
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:10,964
But first, Kiki."

327
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:15,343
Excuse me.
Excuse me.

328
00:18:15,678 --> 00:18:16,720
Thank you.

329
00:18:16,804 --> 00:18:17,763
Dim sum?

330
00:18:17,847 --> 00:18:19,514
Uh, yes, yes, yes.

331
00:18:19,682 --> 00:18:21,433
Now, listen.
You work with him.

332
00:18:21,517 --> 00:18:22,768
Thank you.

333
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:24,561
Keep with him.

334
00:18:24,937 --> 00:18:27,773
So come on, Katharine,
what do you say?

335
00:18:27,857 --> 00:18:29,649
Jim, the man who spends

336
00:18:29,734 --> 00:18:32,527
every weekend in August
glued to his desk

337
00:18:32,612 --> 00:18:35,614
knows I can't sneak out
of my own party.

338
00:18:36,616 --> 00:18:38,074
I'll tell you what,
though.

339
00:18:38,576 --> 00:18:41,328
Get me in on the Southeast Air
divestiture plan,

340
00:18:41,746 --> 00:18:43,455
I'll buy you a drink...

341
00:18:43,539 --> 00:18:46,166
a bottle of Crystal,
two straws.

342
00:18:47,293 --> 00:18:48,710
Deal?

343
00:18:48,878 --> 00:18:50,504
Okey-dokey.

344
00:18:51,214 --> 00:18:52,714
Dim sum?

345
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:54,132
Hi.

346
00:18:54,217 --> 00:18:55,300
Thank you.

347
00:18:55,384 --> 00:18:56,635
What a slob.

348
00:18:56,719 --> 00:18:58,136
You were
so smooth with him.

349
00:18:58,221 --> 00:19:00,555
- I probably would have...
- Never burn bridges.

350
00:19:01,057 --> 00:19:02,224
Today's junior prick,

351
00:19:02,308 --> 00:19:04,142
tomorrow's senior partner.

352
00:19:04,227 --> 00:19:06,603
So how do you think
the party's going?

353
00:19:06,687 --> 00:19:08,230
Pretty well,
I think.

354
00:19:08,481 --> 00:19:10,357
Should I stop
serving now?

355
00:19:11,567 --> 00:19:13,235
Better make
one more round.

356
00:19:14,111 --> 00:19:16,822
I'd love to help you,
but you can't busy the quarterback

357
00:19:16,906 --> 00:19:18,156
with passing out
the Gatorade.

358
00:19:18,241 --> 00:19:20,700
Arnie, my hero,
you've come.

359
00:19:34,090 --> 00:19:35,507
Yeah?

360
00:19:38,594 --> 00:19:41,054
Um, I have an idea, and you said
I could come to you.

361
00:19:41,597 --> 00:19:42,931
Shoot.

362
00:19:46,435 --> 00:19:48,603
Well, you know
how Trask Industries

363
00:19:48,688 --> 00:19:51,147
has been looking to
buy into broadcasting?

364
00:19:51,357 --> 00:19:53,149
Something about
the department is...

365
00:19:53,234 --> 00:19:54,276
Working on it. Yeah.

366
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:55,527
I've been
following it myself,

367
00:19:55,611 --> 00:19:57,571
and I suddenly
thought, "Radio."

368
00:19:58,865 --> 00:20:01,032
Trask is looking
for television stations.

369
00:20:01,534 --> 00:20:03,535
Well, so is every Tom,
Dick and Harry.

370
00:20:03,619 --> 00:20:06,037
My idea is that they
get their feet wet in radio

371
00:20:06,122 --> 00:20:07,205
and build
from there.

372
00:20:07,290 --> 00:20:09,958
It's not as glamorous
as jumping into TV,

373
00:20:10,042 --> 00:20:13,336
but it's a solid start,
and there's more of them for sale.

374
00:20:14,046 --> 00:20:15,589
It would solve
Trask's problem

375
00:20:15,673 --> 00:20:18,216
with Japanese competitors
trying to take him over.

376
00:20:18,634 --> 00:20:20,552
FCC forbids
foreign ownership

377
00:20:20,636 --> 00:20:22,512
of radio
as well as TV.

378
00:20:26,309 --> 00:20:27,434
Interesting.

379
00:20:27,518 --> 00:20:31,354
You've been, um...
following this, you say?

380
00:20:31,898 --> 00:20:33,106
Yeah.

381
00:20:33,649 --> 00:20:35,191
No chance
you overheard it,

382
00:20:35,318 --> 00:20:37,819
say, um...
on the elevator?

383
00:20:38,446 --> 00:20:39,821
No. No way.

384
00:20:40,031 --> 00:20:41,156
Somewhere?

385
00:20:41,782 --> 00:20:42,824
It's my idea.

386
00:20:43,868 --> 00:20:45,660
Good. Good.

387
00:20:48,331 --> 00:20:49,581
Discuss it
with anyone else?

388
00:20:50,124 --> 00:20:51,708
Nope. You think that

389
00:20:51,792 --> 00:20:53,126
there's something
there?

390
00:20:54,337 --> 00:20:55,587
I'll think it through
for you.

391
00:20:55,671 --> 00:20:57,797
Leave me your notes.
I'll have a look-see.

392
00:20:58,549 --> 00:21:00,008
O.K.

393
00:21:00,843 --> 00:21:03,428
Uh... I've been trying
to get into the entree program.

394
00:21:03,512 --> 00:21:05,013
This would be
a big push.

395
00:21:05,097 --> 00:21:06,932
If anything happens...

396
00:21:07,016 --> 00:21:10,060
Absolutely, Tess.
Two-way street, remember?

397
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,188
Yeah. Thank you.

398
00:21:34,502 --> 00:21:36,628
It's just...
It's so exciting.

399
00:21:36,712 --> 00:21:38,880
I mean, she takes
me seriously.

400
00:21:39,215 --> 00:21:40,548
I think it's because...

401
00:21:40,633 --> 00:21:41,800
I know you hate
when I say this,

402
00:21:41,884 --> 00:21:43,969
but I think it's because
she's a woman.

403
00:21:44,553 --> 00:21:47,597
There's none of that
chasing-around-the-desk crap.

404
00:21:47,682 --> 00:21:51,893
It's like she wants to be my mentor,
which is what I needed.

405
00:21:52,019 --> 00:21:54,813
I feel like I'm finally
getting somewhere, Mick.

406
00:21:54,897 --> 00:21:56,523
Tess, that's great,
but let's step on it...

407
00:21:56,607 --> 00:21:58,650
or the pizza's
gonna freeze, honey.

408
00:21:59,652 --> 00:22:02,779
Maybe we could all
go out sometime...

409
00:22:02,863 --> 00:22:04,447
you know,
dinner in the city.

410
00:22:04,907 --> 00:22:06,950
You would like her,
I think.

411
00:22:07,910 --> 00:22:10,745
God, remember when all you had
to do was a few buckles?

412
00:22:10,955 --> 00:22:12,580
Yep. Those
were the days.

413
00:22:13,749 --> 00:22:14,958
I called the inn.

414
00:22:15,042 --> 00:22:18,211
All they can give you is a
ground-floor single in the new wing.

415
00:22:20,256 --> 00:22:21,715
Did you tell them
it was me?

416
00:22:22,842 --> 00:22:25,093
Well... I said Parker.

417
00:22:35,146 --> 00:22:38,106
Helmut, hier ist
Katharine Parker.

[Speaking German]

419
00:22:59,879 --> 00:23:01,296
Ciao.

420
00:23:03,466 --> 00:23:05,467
It's this tower room
with a canopy bed

421
00:23:05,551 --> 00:23:07,802
and a fireplace
big enough to stand in.

422
00:23:08,888 --> 00:23:10,430
Perfect.

423
00:23:10,514 --> 00:23:11,890
Everything's in place.

424
00:23:13,392 --> 00:23:14,476
For what?

425
00:23:15,102 --> 00:23:17,020
The man I've been
seeing for a while.

426
00:23:17,897 --> 00:23:19,898
I think he's it,

427
00:23:19,982 --> 00:23:22,942
and this could be
the weekend we decide.

428
00:23:23,027 --> 00:23:24,694
He said there was
something very important

429
00:23:24,779 --> 00:23:26,696
he wanted to discuss
with me.

430
00:23:27,281 --> 00:23:30,200
- I think he's gonna pop the question.
- You do?

431
00:23:30,284 --> 00:23:32,535
I think so.
We're in the same city.

432
00:23:32,995 --> 00:23:35,705
I've indicated
that I'm receptive to an offer,

433
00:23:35,790 --> 00:23:37,415
I've cleared June,

434
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:39,709
and I am,
after all, me.

435
00:23:41,504 --> 00:23:44,172
Well, what if he doesn't
pop the question?

436
00:23:45,674 --> 00:23:47,759
I really don't think
that's a variable.

437
00:23:49,095 --> 00:23:50,178
Tess, you know,

438
00:23:50,262 --> 00:23:51,596
you don't get anywhere
in this world

439
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:54,432
by waiting for what you want
to come to you.

440
00:23:55,184 --> 00:23:56,893
You make it happen.

441
00:23:57,937 --> 00:23:59,521
Watch me, Tess.

442
00:24:00,064 --> 00:24:01,564
Learn from me.

443
00:24:04,068 --> 00:24:06,986
Oh, I ran your
Trask radio idea

444
00:24:07,071 --> 00:24:08,363
by some
of our people.

445
00:24:08,697 --> 00:24:11,032
It seems Trask
is dead set on television.

446
00:24:12,368 --> 00:24:14,035
It wasn't out
in left field.

447
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:15,578
I really
like the idea.

448
00:24:15,871 --> 00:24:18,748
Keep plugging.
Bring me your ideas.

449
00:24:18,833 --> 00:24:20,208
We'll see
what we can do.

450
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:23,378
Thank you, Katharine.

451
00:24:23,712 --> 00:24:24,838
Tess.

452
00:24:25,673 --> 00:24:28,466
Tess, look at me.

453
00:24:28,801 --> 00:24:29,926
Who makes it happen?

454
00:24:32,596 --> 00:24:33,847
I do.

455
00:24:34,473 --> 00:24:35,723
Who does?

456
00:24:37,852 --> 00:24:39,602
I do.
I make it happen.

457
00:24:40,229 --> 00:24:43,731
That's right. Only then
do we get what we deserve.

458
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:04,002
Aah...

Miss Parker's office.

462
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:13,219
Hi, Katharine.

463
00:25:13,304 --> 00:25:14,429
You what?

464
00:25:14,805 --> 00:25:16,472
Broke it skiing.

465
00:25:16,557 --> 00:25:19,017
They can't move me
for weeks.

466
00:25:19,101 --> 00:25:20,643
This is what I need
you to do.

467
00:25:21,770 --> 00:25:23,938
Water plants, O.K.

468
00:25:25,608 --> 00:25:27,775
Cable comes on Friday,
right.

469
00:25:28,027 --> 00:25:30,111
Hey, easy with the leg.

470
00:25:30,237 --> 00:25:32,155
Quit staring up my gown.

471
00:25:32,573 --> 00:25:34,699
I'm staying
at my parents' house,

472
00:25:34,783 --> 00:25:36,701
and the housekeeper
is in Barbados for a month.

473
00:25:36,785 --> 00:25:38,661
Wouldn't you know it?
What a mess.

474
00:25:38,871 --> 00:25:40,371
You need to let in
the flower man

475
00:25:40,456 --> 00:25:42,290
and the cleaning lady.

476
00:25:42,374 --> 00:25:44,959
The entrance code
for the front door is...

477
00:25:46,462 --> 00:25:49,464
[Whispering]
It's 7-5-4-3-2000.

478
00:25:50,299 --> 00:25:53,176
I know there's more,
but I can't think of what.

479
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:54,886
Go through
my desk calendar.

480
00:25:54,970 --> 00:25:57,472
There's a bunch of invitations
to be RSVP'd.

481
00:25:58,307 --> 00:26:01,392
I know I'm asking
an awful lot, Tess.

482
00:26:01,852 --> 00:26:03,394
I don't know
what else to do.

483
00:26:03,479 --> 00:26:04,938
I need you to take over.

484
00:26:05,439 --> 00:26:07,732
O.K. Bye.

little knickknacks from the Alberts...

Dear Eleanor and Gary,

499
00:27:30,858 --> 00:27:33,443
Thank you for the beautiful
salt and pepper shakers.

500
00:27:33,610 --> 00:27:35,987
Not only are they the perfect
housewarming gift,

501
00:27:36,071 --> 00:27:37,655
but it was dear of you
to think of me

502
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:39,907
so far away.

503
00:27:40,909 --> 00:27:44,037
Dear Sister,
It's been eight years

504
00:27:44,121 --> 00:27:46,080
since we said good-bye
to Wellesley.

505
00:27:46,332 --> 00:27:48,541
Of course, we never really
say good-bye.

since we said
good-bye to Wellesley.

511
00:28:04,183 --> 00:28:05,516
of course,
we never really...

512
00:28:05,601 --> 00:28:06,684
say good-bye.

so lovely to see you

I mean it is,
but I can explain.

543
00:30:27,117 --> 00:30:28,784
Well, not
exactly explain...

544
00:30:29,077 --> 00:30:30,578
You snake.

545
00:30:33,457 --> 00:30:34,582
Shit.

546
00:30:42,090 --> 00:30:44,800
Come on, Tess!
I'm sorry! I really am!

547
00:30:45,802 --> 00:30:48,554
I love you!
Come on!

548
00:30:48,931 --> 00:30:50,556
Come back
and hit me!

549
00:30:51,725 --> 00:30:53,267
Please!

550
00:31:38,146 --> 00:31:41,315
[In Nasal Voice]
Hello. Mr. Trainer's office, please.

551
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:42,567
[Clears Throat]

552
00:31:42,651 --> 00:31:44,986
Hello. Tess McGill calling
from Petty-Marsh.

553
00:31:45,112 --> 00:31:46,487
May I put her through?

554
00:31:46,822 --> 00:31:48,281
Thank you.

555
00:31:52,202 --> 00:31:53,661
[Normal Voice]
Mr. Trainer?

556
00:31:54,162 --> 00:31:55,580
Hi. This is Tess McGill.

557
00:31:55,664 --> 00:31:56,914
I work
with Katharine Parker

558
00:31:56,999 --> 00:31:59,000
over here in Mergers
and Acquisitions.

559
00:32:00,043 --> 00:32:01,127
I have a proposal

560
00:32:01,211 --> 00:32:03,212
that I'd like
to discuss with you.

561
00:32:03,547 --> 00:32:05,506
Not over the phone, though.

562
00:32:06,925 --> 00:32:10,344
Um, I have an opening
tomorrow morning at 10:00.

563
00:32:11,763 --> 00:32:13,180
O.K.

564
00:32:13,849 --> 00:32:16,517
I'll messenger an outline
over to you right now.

565
00:32:17,769 --> 00:32:19,103
Bye.

566
00:32:20,772 --> 00:32:22,356
Whew.

567
00:32:39,166 --> 00:32:41,334
Yes, I'm calling
for Katharine Parker

568
00:32:41,418 --> 00:32:43,252
in regard
to your invitation.

569
00:32:43,337 --> 00:32:44,545
Miss Parker
is out of town,

570
00:32:44,630 --> 00:32:47,548
but Miss Tess McGill
will be attending in her place.

571
00:32:48,008 --> 00:32:49,884
Thank you. Bye.

572
00:33:02,230 --> 00:33:03,898
Why does it do that?

573
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:06,317
For cleaning.

574
00:33:06,401 --> 00:33:07,902
Are you kidding me?

575
00:33:08,403 --> 00:33:09,987
No.

576
00:33:15,035 --> 00:33:17,453
What is this thing
you're going to, anyway?

577
00:33:17,537 --> 00:33:20,414
A closing party for
the Minadine-Dalton merger.

578
00:33:20,791 --> 00:33:21,916
Dewey-Stone's
throwing it,

579
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,417
which is where
Jack Trainer works.

580
00:33:24,961 --> 00:33:26,754
Mix business
with pleasure.

581
00:33:26,838 --> 00:33:28,673
Fringe times are crucial.

582
00:33:28,757 --> 00:33:30,883
Did you snatch
her invite?

583
00:33:31,426 --> 00:33:33,219
Well, she can't use it.

584
00:33:33,303 --> 00:33:36,681
It's important for me
to interact with people

585
00:33:36,765 --> 00:33:38,015
not as a secretary.

586
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:40,017
But as
a total impostor.

587
00:33:40,102 --> 00:33:41,394
Right.

588
00:33:43,855 --> 00:33:45,606
This is it.

589
00:33:47,776 --> 00:33:50,152
It needs some bows
or something.

590
00:33:51,405 --> 00:33:52,571
No.

591
00:33:52,656 --> 00:33:55,700
It's simple, elegant,
yet makes a statement.

592
00:33:55,784 --> 00:33:58,703
Says to people,
confident, a risk-taker,

593
00:33:59,037 --> 00:34:00,579
not afraid
to be noticed.

594
00:34:00,664 --> 00:34:03,165
Then you hit them
with your smarts.

595
00:34:03,250 --> 00:34:05,000
Here. Shoes.
I need shoes.

596
00:34:07,754 --> 00:34:09,338
$6,000?

597
00:34:09,423 --> 00:34:11,340
It's not
even leather!

598
00:34:13,301 --> 00:34:14,969
$6,000?

599
00:34:18,014 --> 00:34:19,974
$6,000?

600
00:34:20,809 --> 00:34:21,892
Cyn...

601
00:34:21,977 --> 00:34:23,310
I can't breathe
so good.

602
00:34:23,395 --> 00:34:24,979
Oh, God, come here.

603
00:34:25,522 --> 00:34:26,981
Sit down.

604
00:34:27,065 --> 00:34:29,400
Let's see if she's got
anything soothing.

605
00:34:42,873 --> 00:34:43,956
Valium.

606
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:46,000
In the convenient
economy size.

607
00:34:46,752 --> 00:34:47,877
You sure?

608
00:34:47,961 --> 00:34:50,546
It just chills you ever so slightly.
You won't even notice it.

609
00:34:55,010 --> 00:34:56,510
Ohh.

610
00:34:57,429 --> 00:34:59,346
Are you sure
about this?

611
00:35:00,515 --> 00:35:02,183
You want to be
taken seriously,

612
00:35:02,267 --> 00:35:04,143
you need serious hair.

613
00:35:07,773 --> 00:35:08,814
Hmm.

614
00:35:40,388 --> 00:35:42,515
[Man] I've been telling you
this for three weeks.

615
00:35:42,599 --> 00:35:46,519
We got 25%.
We get another 5%,

616
00:35:46,603 --> 00:35:48,103
we've got them
by the throat.

617
00:35:48,188 --> 00:35:49,605
[Woman] Listen, Trainer,
let's grab them by the balls.

618
00:35:49,689 --> 00:35:51,649
- Leave our hearts at home.
- Cut them off at the knees.

619
00:35:51,733 --> 00:35:54,443
They'll be eating out of our hands.
What do you say?

620
00:35:55,987 --> 00:35:57,488
Anybody thirsty?

621
00:35:58,198 --> 00:35:59,615
We need
this one, Trainer.

622
00:35:59,699 --> 00:36:00,991
You need this one.

623
00:36:01,076 --> 00:36:02,493
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

624
00:36:15,423 --> 00:36:16,757
I've been
looking for you.

625
00:36:18,593 --> 00:36:19,635
Why? Do you know me?

626
00:36:19,761 --> 00:36:22,429
No, but I promised myself
that when I saw you,

627
00:36:22,973 --> 00:36:24,807
I would
get to know you.

628
00:36:25,392 --> 00:36:27,476
You're the first woman I've seen
at one of these things

629
00:36:27,561 --> 00:36:28,686
that dresses
like a woman,

630
00:36:28,770 --> 00:36:31,480
not like a woman thinks
a man would if he was a woman.

631
00:36:32,482 --> 00:36:33,858
Thank you, I guess.

632
00:36:33,942 --> 00:36:35,860
What are you
doing here?

633
00:36:36,278 --> 00:36:38,237
I'm looking
for someone myself.

634
00:36:38,321 --> 00:36:39,572
His name
is Jack Trainer.

635
00:36:39,656 --> 00:36:40,948
He works
at Dewey-Stone.

636
00:36:41,032 --> 00:36:42,825
Do you know
if he's here?

637
00:36:43,451 --> 00:36:45,327
Why are you
looking for him?

638
00:36:46,121 --> 00:36:48,289
I have a meeting
with him tomorrow,

639
00:36:48,373 --> 00:36:50,332
and I thought I might
say hello

640
00:36:50,417 --> 00:36:51,834
and get a head start.

641
00:36:53,795 --> 00:36:55,212
Well, he, uh...

642
00:36:56,423 --> 00:36:57,965
just left.

643
00:36:59,593 --> 00:37:00,968
Oh.

644
00:37:02,262 --> 00:37:03,721
Well, I should
be going myself.

645
00:37:03,805 --> 00:37:05,389
Well, have a drink
with me.

646
00:37:05,974 --> 00:37:07,766
I can't.
What's your name?

647
00:37:09,019 --> 00:37:10,561
No. No names,

648
00:37:10,937 --> 00:37:12,354
no business cards,

649
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:14,189
no "You must know
so and so."

650
00:37:14,274 --> 00:37:15,774
- What is this?
- No resumes.

651
00:37:15,859 --> 00:37:17,568
Let's just meet
like human beings,

652
00:37:17,652 --> 00:37:19,153
for once.

653
00:37:21,364 --> 00:37:23,407
It's nice to meet you,
whatever your name is,

654
00:37:23,491 --> 00:37:24,992
but I really do
have to go.

655
00:37:25,368 --> 00:37:26,493
Please?

656
00:37:26,620 --> 00:37:28,412
Please... one drink.

657
00:37:31,333 --> 00:37:33,751
O.K., one drink,
but I'm buying.

658
00:37:34,544 --> 00:37:36,170
O.K., but it's
an open bar.

659
00:37:36,546 --> 00:37:37,755
Right. I knew that.

660
00:37:37,839 --> 00:37:38,923
I meant that
if it wasn't,

661
00:37:39,007 --> 00:37:41,216
- I would be buying.
- Yeah.

662
00:37:41,301 --> 00:37:43,552
Tequila gold.
Doubles.

663
00:37:44,137 --> 00:37:45,179
Tequila.

664
00:37:46,097 --> 00:37:47,681
I promised myself
that when we met,

665
00:37:47,766 --> 00:37:49,183
we'd drink tequila.

666
00:37:49,768 --> 00:37:52,645
No Chardonnay,
no frog water.

667
00:37:53,521 --> 00:37:55,356
Real drinks.

668
00:37:57,609 --> 00:37:59,276
Ha ha.

669
00:38:05,283 --> 00:38:06,784
Oh.

670
00:38:06,910 --> 00:38:07,993
Yeah.

671
00:38:08,995 --> 00:38:10,621
These things
are usually...

672
00:38:10,705 --> 00:38:12,498
so boring.

673
00:38:13,541 --> 00:38:14,875
Ha ha ha!

674
00:38:15,210 --> 00:38:16,585
I wouldn't know.

675
00:38:17,879 --> 00:38:19,797
Power to the people.

676
00:38:22,217 --> 00:38:23,759
The little people.

677
00:38:29,432 --> 00:38:34,269
Oh, boy, oh, boy,
oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy.

678
00:38:34,354 --> 00:38:36,563
Ha ha! You O.K?

679
00:38:36,731 --> 00:38:38,148
I'm fine.

680
00:38:38,483 --> 00:38:39,525
I'm just fine.

681
00:38:39,609 --> 00:38:40,693
I took a...

682
00:38:40,777 --> 00:38:43,654
um, antihistamine
before,

683
00:38:43,738 --> 00:38:45,197
and it just...

684
00:38:45,281 --> 00:38:46,907
makes for
a nice little buzz.

685
00:38:47,033 --> 00:38:48,075
Oh?

686
00:38:48,368 --> 00:38:50,119
I didn't know
they let bad girls

687
00:38:50,203 --> 00:38:51,620
into these things.

688
00:38:52,539 --> 00:38:54,415
Do I look like
I don't belong here?

689
00:38:54,624 --> 00:38:59,628
No, no, I'm sure
you're a real ace

690
00:38:59,713 --> 00:39:02,089
at whatever it is
that you do do.

691
00:39:02,215 --> 00:39:03,465
Damn straight.

692
00:39:03,550 --> 00:39:05,175
But how you look...

693
00:39:08,930 --> 00:39:11,098
I have a head
for business

694
00:39:11,182 --> 00:39:13,100
and a bod for sin.

695
00:39:13,435 --> 00:39:15,352
Is there anything
wrong with that?

696
00:39:17,105 --> 00:39:19,064
No. No.

697
00:39:24,195 --> 00:39:25,195
Hello! Hi!

698
00:39:26,114 --> 00:39:27,614
And I have to
go now.

699
00:39:28,241 --> 00:39:29,366
Well, I'll come
with you.

700
00:39:29,451 --> 00:39:30,617
No.

701
00:39:31,911 --> 00:39:33,328
Hey, Tess!

702
00:39:36,207 --> 00:39:37,207
Uh...

703
00:39:37,292 --> 00:39:38,459
Uh...

704
00:39:38,585 --> 00:39:39,793
Tess!

705
00:39:46,426 --> 00:39:48,385
I need some air.
Meet me outside.

706
00:39:48,470 --> 00:39:49,470
Thank you.

707
00:39:57,479 --> 00:39:58,645
Excuse me, please.

708
00:40:16,831 --> 00:40:17,956
Hello?

709
00:40:18,041 --> 00:40:19,083
Hi.

710
00:40:19,167 --> 00:40:20,250
Hi.

711
00:40:20,335 --> 00:40:21,627
Hello.

712
00:40:23,088 --> 00:40:24,171
Oh.

713
00:40:28,176 --> 00:40:29,510
Where do you live?

714
00:40:29,803 --> 00:40:31,011
Hmm?

715
00:40:32,180 --> 00:40:33,388
Where do you live?

716
00:40:34,057 --> 00:40:35,099
Mmm...

717
00:40:35,183 --> 00:40:36,183
park...

718
00:40:36,267 --> 00:40:37,851
trees...

719
00:40:38,103 --> 00:40:39,686
tall building.

720
00:40:42,357 --> 00:40:44,191
166 Morton, near Hudson.

721
00:40:44,275 --> 00:40:45,484
166 Morton.

722
00:40:58,373 --> 00:41:00,457
It might be
kind of a mess.

723
00:41:00,959 --> 00:41:03,210
The cleaning lady
keeps changing...

724
00:41:04,003 --> 00:41:05,504
days on me.

Trask Industries
has announced plans

780
00:46:09,559 --> 00:46:12,436

789
00:46:28,244 --> 00:46:31,455
It would give Trask
a solid base in broadcasting,

ownership of radio stations,

792
00:46:36,043 --> 00:46:38,628

for a radio network,

one with
a real high profile,

802
00:47:07,658 --> 00:47:09,701
then with
the surplus cash,

803
00:47:09,785 --> 00:47:12,245
we implement a major
stock repurchase.

804
00:47:13,789 --> 00:47:16,750

and their stock goes up,

00:51:59,033 --> 00:52:00,533
What are you
talking about?

908
00:52:05,664 --> 00:52:06,956
Can I get you anything?

909
00:52:07,041 --> 00:52:08,500
Coffee, tea?

910
00:52:09,418 --> 00:52:11,044
You free
for dinner tonight?

911
00:52:11,212 --> 00:52:12,670
No. Sorry.

912
00:52:12,838 --> 00:52:13,963
O.K.

913
00:52:14,215 --> 00:52:16,341
How about tomorrow?
I'll be back around 8:00.

914
00:52:16,425 --> 00:52:17,884
I can't.

915
00:52:18,052 --> 00:52:19,469
When, then?

916
00:52:19,553 --> 00:52:21,137
I don't think
that we should

917
00:52:21,222 --> 00:52:22,555
get involved
that way.

918
00:52:23,307 --> 00:52:25,225
What about last night?

919
00:52:26,185 --> 00:52:28,061
Look, I'm not
that girl.

920
00:52:28,145 --> 00:52:31,606
- Last night was... special.
- It wasn't so special...

921
00:52:31,690 --> 00:52:33,942
I had to carry you up
three flights of stairs.

922
00:52:34,026 --> 00:52:35,902
I meant "unusual"
special.

923
00:52:36,487 --> 00:52:38,988
Look, we're in a business deal
together now.

924
00:52:39,073 --> 00:52:40,990
I just don't think

925
00:52:41,075 --> 00:52:42,992
we should get
involved that way.

926
00:52:43,077 --> 00:52:45,453
My life is
real complicated.

927
00:52:45,538 --> 00:52:49,249
I don't want to complicate it.
I just thought dinner, a movie.

928
00:52:49,333 --> 00:52:51,501
We both know what
we're talking about.

929
00:52:51,585 --> 00:52:52,752
I certainly hope so.

930
00:52:53,796 --> 00:52:54,838
You know...

931
00:52:54,922 --> 00:52:57,006
maybe I just
don't like you.

932
00:52:57,174 --> 00:52:58,258
Me?

933
00:52:58,425 --> 00:52:59,551
Nah.

934
00:52:59,969 --> 00:53:01,427
Ha ha ha!

935
00:53:04,557 --> 00:53:08,560
Tonight's the night
we're gonna make it happen

936
00:53:09,478 --> 00:53:13,398
Tonight we'll put
all other things aside

937
00:53:15,025 --> 00:53:19,320
Give in this time
and show me some affection

938
00:53:19,989 --> 00:53:24,701
We're going for
those pleasures in the night

939
00:53:25,578 --> 00:53:26,953
You sure
she's going to show?

940
00:53:27,037 --> 00:53:28,454
It's my
engagement party.

941
00:53:28,539 --> 00:53:30,623
She knows she's dead meat
if she doesn't.

942
00:53:31,083 --> 00:53:34,794
...Please you,
I just can't get enough

943
00:53:35,546 --> 00:53:36,713
Hi, Tess.

944
00:53:36,797 --> 00:53:40,300
...Move real slow,
I'll let it go

945
00:53:40,509 --> 00:53:41,968
Let's get excited

946
00:53:42,094 --> 00:53:44,220
I'm sorry.
I got stuck at work.

947
00:53:44,346 --> 00:53:46,890
You'll be out of work,
you keep scamming like you are.

948
00:53:46,974 --> 00:53:49,183
I am nervous as hell.

949
00:53:49,268 --> 00:53:51,769
Mick's about to drown himself
in the scotch.

950
00:53:52,521 --> 00:53:53,980
He's bad, huh?

951
00:53:54,148 --> 00:53:55,648
Throw him a bone,
will you?

952
00:53:55,733 --> 00:53:58,151
I want happy humans
here tonight.

953
00:54:00,154 --> 00:54:01,654
I want you, I want you

954
00:54:10,831 --> 00:54:13,750
Ooh, boy,
I want to love you

955
00:54:13,876 --> 00:54:15,418
Tess.

956
00:54:15,794 --> 00:54:17,170
Snake.

957
00:54:17,671 --> 00:54:20,340
I want to squeeze you,
please you...

958
00:54:20,674 --> 00:54:22,133
You look different.

959
00:54:23,010 --> 00:54:24,844
Well,
I'm not the same

960
00:54:24,929 --> 00:54:26,846
pathetic, trusting
fool I was.

961
00:54:26,931 --> 00:54:28,556
It shows, huh?

962
00:54:28,682 --> 00:54:31,225
What are
you having?

963
00:54:31,310 --> 00:54:33,353
Stow this behind
the bar for me.

964
00:54:33,437 --> 00:54:35,730
I'll have a Chivas,

965
00:54:35,814 --> 00:54:37,273
and buy Mick
one of whatever.

966
00:54:37,358 --> 00:54:38,775
You got it.

967
00:54:38,859 --> 00:54:40,318
Ahem.

968
00:54:40,945 --> 00:54:42,278
I just meant
the hair

969
00:54:42,363 --> 00:54:44,072
and the duds
and the briefcase.

970
00:54:44,156 --> 00:54:45,490
What's going on?

971
00:54:45,574 --> 00:54:46,824
Make fun
if you want.

972
00:54:46,909 --> 00:54:48,534
No, No.
You look good.

973
00:54:50,037 --> 00:54:51,162
Classy.

974
00:54:51,538 --> 00:54:53,623
What, did you
have to go

975
00:54:53,707 --> 00:54:55,750
to traffic court
or something?

976
00:54:56,669 --> 00:54:58,252
No, I just
got off work.

977
00:54:58,337 --> 00:55:00,213
I sort of got
a promotion.

978
00:55:02,758 --> 00:55:04,384
Well...

979
00:55:04,468 --> 00:55:06,886
to Cyn and Tim...

980
00:55:07,346 --> 00:55:08,888
to you and me...

981
00:55:09,598 --> 00:55:11,391
to you and your promotion...

982
00:55:11,976 --> 00:55:13,893
to me getting
a boat loan.

983
00:55:13,978 --> 00:55:15,895
You what? You did?

984
00:55:16,230 --> 00:55:18,606
My loan was approved
just this morning.

985
00:55:18,691 --> 00:55:21,150
Put a down payment
on Jimmy Noonan's old boat.

986
00:55:21,235 --> 00:55:22,694
That's so great.

987
00:55:32,788 --> 00:55:34,914
Never seen you
looking so lovely

988
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:37,250
As you did tonight

989
00:55:37,418 --> 00:55:40,128
I've never seen you
shine so bright

990
00:55:40,754 --> 00:55:43,089
Hmm hmm hmm mmm

991
00:55:45,426 --> 00:55:47,010
Never seen so many men

992
00:55:47,094 --> 00:55:49,429
Ask you if
you wanted to dance

993
00:55:50,139 --> 00:55:52,932
Looking for
a little romance

994
00:55:53,434 --> 00:55:56,352
Given half a chance

995
00:55:57,771 --> 00:56:00,606
I have never seen
that dress you're wearing

996
00:56:00,983 --> 00:56:03,276
Or the highlights
in your hair

997
00:56:03,360 --> 00:56:05,903
That catch your eye

998
00:56:06,238 --> 00:56:08,740
I have been blind

999
00:56:08,949 --> 00:56:12,618
Lady in red

1000
00:56:12,953 --> 00:56:14,245
Woo!

1001
00:56:14,747 --> 00:56:17,123
"Hours of fun
for the entire family.

1002
00:56:17,207 --> 00:56:19,125
Love, Tess and Mick."

1003
00:56:19,293 --> 00:56:20,293
Thank you.

1004
00:56:22,838 --> 00:56:24,297
I put from both of us.

1005
00:56:24,381 --> 00:56:26,466
I didn't know if
you'd gotten something.

1006
00:56:27,176 --> 00:56:29,135
O.K., toast.
We need a toast!

1007
00:56:31,764 --> 00:56:32,930
Thank you,
thank you.

1008
00:56:33,015 --> 00:56:35,558
From me and Tess,
and everybody here,

1009
00:56:35,642 --> 00:56:37,810
may your life together
be long and happy,

1010
00:56:37,895 --> 00:56:40,229
and may the road always
rise up to meet you.

1011
00:56:40,314 --> 00:56:41,731
Hear, hear!

1012
00:56:44,151 --> 00:56:45,902
When will we toast
the two of you?

1013
00:56:45,986 --> 00:56:46,986
Yeah!

1014
00:56:47,780 --> 00:56:49,030
Ha ha ha!

1015
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:52,575
Well, we haven't
really discussed it.

1016
00:56:52,659 --> 00:56:54,243
I mean,
not recently.

1017
00:56:54,328 --> 00:56:56,162
You don't discuss it,
you just ask.

1018
00:56:56,288 --> 00:56:57,705
That's right.

1019
00:56:58,165 --> 00:56:59,248
Here?

1020
00:56:59,333 --> 00:57:00,416
Yeah!

1021
00:57:00,501 --> 00:57:01,626
Now?

1022
00:57:01,710 --> 00:57:02,752
Yeah!

1023
00:57:02,836 --> 00:57:04,045
On your knees, man.

1024
00:57:05,089 --> 00:57:06,172
Mick! Mick!

1025
00:57:06,340 --> 00:57:09,258
Mick! Mick! Mick!
Mick! Mick! Mick!

1026
00:57:09,343 --> 00:57:12,386
Mick! Mick! Mick!
Mick! Mick! Mick!

1027
00:57:12,513 --> 00:57:14,305
Yeah!

1028
00:57:14,598 --> 00:57:15,765
Ya-hah!

1029
00:57:15,891 --> 00:57:17,183
Yeah! Woo!

1030
00:57:19,520 --> 00:57:20,603
Here!

1031
00:57:23,273 --> 00:57:25,191
Tess, will you marry me?

1032
00:57:27,528 --> 00:57:28,736
Maybe.

1033
00:57:29,071 --> 00:57:30,238
Ooh!

1034
00:57:30,781 --> 00:57:32,281
That's an answer?

1035
00:57:34,326 --> 00:57:36,869
You want another answer,
ask another girl.

1036
00:57:37,204 --> 00:57:38,329
[Man]
Whoa!

1037
00:57:38,580 --> 00:57:39,664
Sssss!

1038
00:57:39,748 --> 00:57:40,706
Ha ha!

1039
00:57:53,137 --> 00:57:55,012
You fuckin'
humiliated us in there.

1040
00:57:55,097 --> 00:57:59,809
You set us up. What did you expect me
to do, lie in front of those people...

1041
00:57:59,893 --> 00:58:02,436
- and automatically say yes?
- Didn't know you'd have to lie.

1042
00:58:02,521 --> 00:58:04,438
I thought you would
want me to ask.

1043
00:58:04,523 --> 00:58:07,316
Three nights ago,
I find you in bed with Doreen.

1044
00:58:07,401 --> 00:58:10,111
We have a drink and a dance,
then you want an answer

1045
00:58:10,195 --> 00:58:12,905
- about the rest of my life.
- All right. O.K.

1046
00:58:13,407 --> 00:58:16,367
Here we are.
Will you marry me or what?

1047
00:58:16,785 --> 00:58:19,245
Jesus, Mick.
Do we have to decide now?

1048
00:58:19,413 --> 00:58:22,123
I want to get things
solidified in my life.

1049
00:58:22,249 --> 00:58:24,167
You're not the only one
who's got plans.

1050
00:58:25,002 --> 00:58:26,169
I said maybe.

1051
00:58:26,253 --> 00:58:29,589
Maybe means dick!
Fuck maybe! I want an answer!

1052
00:58:30,048 --> 00:58:32,884
Please don't yell.
You treat me like...

1053
00:58:32,968 --> 00:58:35,761
Why do we always end up talking
about the way you get treated?

1054
00:58:35,846 --> 00:58:38,097
Who the fuck died
and made you Grace Kelly?

1055
00:58:39,391 --> 00:58:40,892
I am not steak.

1056
00:58:41,435 --> 00:58:43,060
You can't
just order me.

1057
00:58:43,228 --> 00:58:44,478
I don't need this.

1058
00:58:44,563 --> 00:58:46,522
You get your priorities straight,
maybe we'll talk.

1059
00:58:46,607 --> 00:58:48,191
Right now,
we're history.

1060
00:59:12,382 --> 00:59:13,883
[Ring]

1061
00:59:17,095 --> 00:59:18,638
Katharine Parker's office.

1062
00:59:20,015 --> 00:59:23,142
Um... I'll
switch you over.

1063
00:59:24,353 --> 00:59:25,436
[Knock On Door]

1064
00:59:25,520 --> 00:59:26,979
Tess, it's me.

1065
00:59:31,360 --> 00:59:32,526
I couldn't find
the right shoes.

1066
00:59:32,611 --> 00:59:33,611
Shh!

1067
00:59:36,073 --> 00:59:37,782
Tess McGill's office.

1068
00:59:38,408 --> 00:59:39,617
Who's calling?

1069
00:59:40,035 --> 00:59:41,911
One moment, please.

1070
00:59:42,913 --> 00:59:44,288
Ahem...

1071
00:59:44,790 --> 00:59:45,873
Jack.

1072
00:59:46,250 --> 00:59:48,584
Went well
in Memphis. Yeah.

1073
00:59:48,669 --> 00:59:50,294
Really well,
I think.

1074
00:59:50,420 --> 00:59:52,880
We'll have to move fast
and hit them high.

1075
00:59:53,131 --> 00:59:56,259
Armbrister thinks
of Metro as family.

1076
00:59:56,343 --> 00:59:58,261
You know how that can be.

1077
00:59:58,345 --> 01:00:00,137
He's willing to listen.

1078
01:00:00,806 --> 01:00:03,099
We got to get Trask
to talk sweet.

1079
01:00:03,183 --> 01:00:05,101
He's thinking
about 70 mill.

1080
01:00:05,978 --> 01:00:08,813
I've been up here all night,
working the numbers.

1081
01:00:09,356 --> 01:00:10,731
I'd like to go
over it with you.

1082
01:00:10,816 --> 01:00:12,441
Can we meet for lunch?

1083
01:00:12,526 --> 01:00:16,279
Lunch is all right, isn't it?
Daylight, lot of people around.

1084
01:00:16,363 --> 01:00:18,781
There's a real romantic

1086
01:00:21,326 --> 01:00:23,828
You're in no particular
danger, I think.

1087
01:00:28,542 --> 01:00:30,710
Yeah. Meet you there
around 1:00.

1088
01:00:31,336 --> 01:00:33,254
O.K., I'll see you
then. Bye.

1089
01:00:36,133 --> 01:00:37,550
Mick's really raw.

1090
01:00:39,261 --> 01:00:40,636
He says
he's going to throw

1091
01:00:40,721 --> 01:00:42,346
the rest
of your stuff out.

1092
01:00:44,016 --> 01:00:47,101
He kept talking at me
till 5:00 this morning.

1093
01:00:47,728 --> 01:00:49,603
Oh, God, Cyn,
I'm sorry.

1094
01:00:52,733 --> 01:00:54,775
How hard would it be
to crash a wedding?

1095
01:00:55,110 --> 01:00:56,485
What are you
talking about?

1096
01:00:56,862 --> 01:00:58,821
Oren Trask's daughter
is getting married tomorrow.

1097
01:00:58,905 --> 01:01:03,242
There's a reception following,
so I figured I blend in,

1098
01:01:03,493 --> 01:01:04,910
I get to Trask.

1099
01:01:05,078 --> 01:01:06,871
I mean, how hard
could that be?

1100
01:01:08,081 --> 01:01:10,666
The wedding party's
not going to admit

1101
01:01:10,751 --> 01:01:12,126
they've never
seen you before.

1102
01:01:12,210 --> 01:01:14,587
Nobody knows everybody
at those things, right?

1103
01:01:14,671 --> 01:01:17,089
- Tess, wait a minute...
- All I need is five minutes.

1104
01:01:17,299 --> 01:01:19,258
Tess, I'm
talking to you.

1105
01:01:19,801 --> 01:01:21,260
What?

1106
01:01:21,720 --> 01:01:24,013
First of all,
look me in the eye

1107
01:01:24,097 --> 01:01:27,683
and tell me you're not thinking,
even in your wildest dreams,

1108
01:01:27,768 --> 01:01:29,852
Mr. Briefcase-
Let's-Have-Lunch

1109
01:01:29,936 --> 01:01:32,271
will take you away
from all of this.

1110
01:01:33,440 --> 01:01:35,941
We're doing a deal
together, that's all.

1111
01:01:36,109 --> 01:01:38,444
You'll get
your heart stomped

1112
01:01:38,528 --> 01:01:40,196
just like you're
stomping Mick's.

1113
01:01:40,405 --> 01:01:43,949
It wasn't me popping
Doreen Dimucci in our bed.

1114
01:01:44,868 --> 01:01:46,619
How come you're
all on his side?

1115
01:01:46,912 --> 01:01:48,245
I'm not.

1116
01:01:49,122 --> 01:01:50,373
You're not even
giving him

1117
01:01:50,457 --> 01:01:53,667
the chance to make it up to you,
and that's not like you.

1118
01:01:54,294 --> 01:01:57,755
If you're so smart,
why don't you act smart

1119
01:01:57,839 --> 01:01:59,590
and save your ass
while you still can?

1120
01:01:59,674 --> 01:02:03,135
You're not going
to have any job.

1121
01:02:04,262 --> 01:02:06,305
You're out of
your man and home already.

1122
01:02:06,473 --> 01:02:07,640
I'm going to
come clean

1123
01:02:07,724 --> 01:02:09,725
as soon as I get
my end set up.

1124
01:02:10,352 --> 01:02:12,978
I swear.
I know what I'm doing.

1125
01:02:13,230 --> 01:02:15,147
So do I.
You're screwin' up your life.

1126
01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:17,400
No, I'm trying
to make it better.

1127
01:02:17,484 --> 01:02:19,568
I won't spend
the rest of my life

1128
01:02:19,653 --> 01:02:21,737
working my ass off
and getting nowhere

1129
01:02:21,822 --> 01:02:25,157
because I followed rules
I didn't set up.

1131
01:02:30,163 --> 01:02:31,497

1133
01:02:34,584 --> 01:02:35,960
Of course it's
still your office.

1134
01:02:36,044 --> 01:02:37,211
I don't know...

1135
01:02:37,295 --> 01:02:38,921
I'll see you, Tess.

1136

1137
01:02:46,138 --> 01:02:50,015
Sometimes I dance around
the house in my underwear.

It doesn't make me
Madonna... never will.

Yes, Katharine.

1141
01:02:59,734 --> 01:03:01,944
Don't get too used
to those long lunches.

1142
01:03:02,028 --> 01:03:03,988
They're letting me go
a week from today.

1143
01:03:05,365 --> 01:03:07,324
Isn't that a little faster
than you thought?

The doctor says
I've got great bones.

Of course, his aren't
too bad, either.

1146

Ha ha ha!

1147
01:03:14,499 --> 01:03:16,709
Anyway, I need you
to summarize...

Hi, Shatz!

Thanks. I'll talk
to you soon.

O.K. Bye.

1154
01:03:35,812 --> 01:03:38,355
What kind of figures
have you thrown at them?

1155
01:03:38,982 --> 01:03:40,983
No exact figures yet.

1156
01:03:41,401 --> 01:03:42,902
Well, what's
their ballpark?

1157
01:03:44,112 --> 01:03:46,822
I wanted to get them
excited about the concept

1158
01:03:46,907 --> 01:03:48,949
before I started throwing
actual figures at them.

1159
01:03:49,034 --> 01:03:50,618
Are they excited?

1160
01:03:50,702 --> 01:03:52,244
They're going to be.

1161
01:03:53,788 --> 01:03:55,414
Wait a minute.

1162
01:03:56,082 --> 01:03:58,167
I've been working
on this for 36 hours

1163

trying to put it
together.

1164
01:03:59,544 --> 01:04:03,380
I got a progress meeting with
the head of my department at 2:00.

1165

Where the hell
are we?

1166

Don't yell at me.

Hey, answer me.

Well, as a matter
of fact,

1169
01:04:11,640 --> 01:04:14,016
I'm going to see
Trask himself tomorrow.

1170
01:04:14,100 --> 01:04:16,852
I feel we're strong enough
to go right to him.

1171
01:04:16,937 --> 01:04:19,313
Where are we meeting him?
What time?

1172
01:04:20,023 --> 01:04:22,107
He's not expecting
both of us.

1173
01:04:25,403 --> 01:04:27,613
Are you trying to
fly this thing without me?

1174
01:04:28,281 --> 01:04:30,866
No... I wouldn't
do that.

1175
01:04:31,368 --> 01:04:33,953
You set up this meeting without me.
What does that say?

1176

What the hell kind of way
to do business is this?

1177

How am I supposed
to calm down?

01:04:40,293 --> 01:04:42,795
One lost deal is all it takes
to get canned.

1180

My phone will have
an inch of tape...

the names
of new guys

there anymore

because
of one lost deal.

I don't want to get
buried under tape.

1186

No one's trying to
bury you under tape.

in a little slump.

them to my face. Give me that much.

any doubts about you.

about your abilities.

or he just lunches late?

3:00 is
a late lunch.

It's not exactly lunch,
but there will be food.

the story, Tess?

trust me.

jump out of the cake?

I'm Tess.
I'm a friend of Mark's.

I'm so happy I could be here
for you today.

Stunning. Really.

This is crazy,

just go.

Excuse me.

The woman dancing with Oren,
what's her name?

1264
01:09:37,757 --> 01:09:39,258
Oh, Elizabeth
Stowenfield.

1265
01:09:39,342 --> 01:09:40,801
That's right.

1266
01:09:41,261 --> 01:09:43,846
Uh... Liz? Beth?

1267
01:09:44,097 --> 01:09:45,138
Bitsy.

1268
01:09:45,223 --> 01:09:46,723

You want to do it,
do it.

Excuse us.
Bitsy, don't break my heart

1272
01:09:57,277 --> 01:09:58,777

you don't remember me.

1273
01:09:59,487 --> 01:10:01,280
Of course I do.

Ha ha ha!
Talk about a small world, huh?

1276
01:10:09,581 --> 01:10:11,248
I mean,
here we've just met,

1277

and yet I feel

1278
01:10:12,792 --> 01:10:15,043
I've spent so much time
working with you.

1279
01:10:16,504 --> 01:10:19,172
I'm in Mergers and Acquisitions
at Petty-Marsh.

1280
01:10:19,757 --> 01:10:22,301
I wish we were having
more luck with your team.

1281
01:10:22,385 --> 01:10:24,636
So do I. So do I.

1282
01:10:24,971 --> 01:10:28,056
I've tried to set you up
with a radio network,

1283
01:10:28,141 --> 01:10:31,810
but my bosses think you're stuck
on acquiring television.

1284
01:10:32,604 --> 01:10:34,021
That's not true.

1285
01:10:34,272 --> 01:10:37,566
I said, the man
who in 1971

1286
01:10:37,650 --> 01:10:38,942
looked into the future

1287
01:10:39,027 --> 01:10:41,778
and saw that it was named
microwave technology,

1288
01:10:41,863 --> 01:10:44,406
the man who applied
Japanese management principles

1289
01:10:44,490 --> 01:10:47,242
while others were
still kowtowing to the unions,

1290
01:10:47,327 --> 01:10:50,913
the man who saw the Ma Bell
breakup coming...

1291
01:10:50,997 --> 01:10:54,791
this man did not get to be
this man... you, I mean...

1292
01:10:54,876 --> 01:10:57,461
by shutting himself
off to new ideas.

1293
01:10:57,545 --> 01:10:59,212
Am I right?

1294
01:10:59,756 --> 01:11:02,341
- I think you're right.
- Damn straight, I'm right.

1295
01:11:02,467 --> 01:11:04,676
If you've got the right property,
I'd love to hear about it.

1296
01:11:04,761 --> 01:11:05,844
You would?

1297
01:11:05,929 --> 01:11:06,970
Absolutely.

1298
01:11:07,055 --> 01:11:08,263
There she is.

1299
01:11:12,185 --> 01:11:13,894
I'm hogging the father
of the bride,

1300
01:11:13,978 --> 01:11:15,437
and I see Phyllis
coming in.

1301

What do you say
that I call you on Monday?

1302
01:11:18,191 --> 01:11:20,484
Our consultant
is Tim Draper.

1303
01:11:20,693 --> 01:11:22,194
Tim. Right.

1304
01:11:22,862 --> 01:11:24,029
Honey, I'm starved.

1305

his people Monday.

Oren Trask...
the man who said,

1312
01:11:35,875 --> 01:11:38,085
what if we slice
the bread before we sold it?

1313
01:11:38,169 --> 01:11:42,798
- All right.
- No, no, no. I loved it. I had fun,

1314
01:11:42,882 --> 01:11:44,299
and you were amazing.

1315
01:11:44,884 --> 01:11:46,134
You think so?

1316
01:11:46,219 --> 01:11:47,344
Amazing.

Ha ha ha.

1318
01:11:52,684 --> 01:11:57,354
The Fort Worth station
projected revenues

1319
01:11:57,480 --> 01:11:59,982
should read
up 8% not 6,

1320
01:12:00,066 --> 01:12:04,069
and where it says
the FCC ruling

1321
01:12:04,153 --> 01:12:07,155
on Metro's Memphis
transmitter is pending,

1322
01:12:07,240 --> 01:12:09,825
that's outdated.
FCC approved it Friday.

1323
01:12:11,244 --> 01:12:13,245

the signal reach.

Ups the station's
value by 30%.

1325
01:12:24,424 --> 01:12:27,843
And now, back to our regularly
scheduled programming.

1326
01:12:37,603 --> 01:12:39,271
I guess we're ready.

- Yes. Top of the stairs.
- Thank you.

Are we waiting
for Mr. Trask?

1330
01:13:07,008 --> 01:13:09,968
Mr. Trask doesn't
sit in at this level.

1331
01:13:10,720 --> 01:13:12,345
Of course
he doesn't.

1332
01:13:13,139 --> 01:13:15,057
Ahem... Here's
the way we see it...

1333
01:13:15,183 --> 01:13:19,144
Trask Industries has
two important needs at this time.

1334
01:13:19,270 --> 01:13:21,730
By acquiring
Metro Radio Network,

1335
01:13:22,190 --> 01:13:24,149
you nail two birds
with one stone.

1336
01:13:24,442 --> 01:13:28,487
Do you have any proposals
besides Metro?

1337
01:13:29,614 --> 01:13:30,697
No. Why?

1338
01:13:30,782 --> 01:13:32,657
Metro's a terrific
opportunity.

1339
01:13:32,992 --> 01:13:35,911
I'm sure it is,
but a Chicago group

1340

this morning... the company's in play.

1341
01:13:41,334 --> 01:13:42,834

1343
01:13:44,629 --> 01:13:46,004
The Slade Brothers.

1344
01:13:46,839 --> 01:13:49,132
Trask isn't aiming
at radio anyway.

We don't want to get
into a bidding war.

A moment, please.

1347
01:13:55,681 --> 01:13:58,600
Armbrister looks at Metro
as part of his family.

1348
01:13:58,684 --> 01:14:00,185
He cares who
he's selling to.

1349
01:14:00,269 --> 01:14:02,020
Yes...
and he holds

1350
01:14:02,105 --> 01:14:03,814
the majority
of the stock.

1351
01:14:05,983 --> 01:14:08,360
If the Slades
are uninvited...

1352
01:14:08,861 --> 01:14:10,237
and I'm sure
they are...

1353
01:14:10,571 --> 01:14:13,615
and Armbrister and Trask can
agree on a deal,

1354
01:14:13,699 --> 01:14:15,283
then we won't
have a war.

1355
01:14:15,576 --> 01:14:18,203
If I get Armbrister,
will Trask meet him?

the meeting.

Mr. Trask?

Yes, it was.

How did you get
this scar?

1372
01:17:11,585 --> 01:17:13,837
Some guy pulled
a knife in Detroit.

No. No. I was 19.

1375
01:17:22,888 --> 01:17:24,973
I thought it would be cool
to have a pierced ear.

My girlfriend stuck
the needle through.

Oh, Tess, take care of the bags.
I'll meet you at the car.

1429
01:21:39,645 --> 01:21:40,979
O Tannenbaum

1430
01:21:41,063 --> 01:21:42,397
O Tannenbaum

1431
01:21:42,481 --> 01:21:43,856
Oh, I love these pills.

1432
01:21:44,358 --> 01:21:47,569
Just for a minute,
Jack... please.

1433
01:21:48,487 --> 01:21:50,863
I must see you,
darling.

1434
01:21:50,948 --> 01:21:52,615
My apartment
in one hour,

1435
01:21:52,700 --> 01:21:54,742
and I won't take no
for an answer.

1436
01:21:54,827 --> 01:21:56,744
No, I won't take no
for an answer.

1437
01:21:59,331 --> 01:22:02,375
Oh, I'm home!
I'm home! I'm home!

1438
01:22:02,835 --> 01:22:04,002
Oh...

1439
01:22:04,461 --> 01:22:06,504
Oh, God.

1440
01:22:11,927 --> 01:22:13,553
Did you happen
to see this?

1441
01:22:13,637 --> 01:22:14,637
What is it?

1442
01:22:14,972 --> 01:22:17,682
It's your idea for a Trask
radio acquisition.

1443
01:22:18,976 --> 01:22:21,185
I was planning to send it
to Jack Trainer...

1444
01:22:21,437 --> 01:22:23,521
give your idea
one last go-round.

1445
01:22:24,273 --> 01:22:26,107
But it occurs to me,
looking at it,

1446
01:22:26,191 --> 01:22:27,984
that it reads as though
it were my idea.

1447
01:22:29,695 --> 01:22:31,863
Jack got burned once...
he was accused

1448
01:22:32,323 --> 01:22:34,407
of stealing a plan
for taking a company private.

1449
01:22:34,491 --> 01:22:36,659
He's very sticky about
the ethics of reviewing

1450
01:22:36,744 --> 01:22:38,703
other people's
formative strategies.

1451
01:22:38,871 --> 01:22:40,246
He wouldn't have
looked at it

1452
01:22:40,331 --> 01:22:41,831
if I'd said it was
from a colleague,

1453
01:22:41,915 --> 01:22:45,293
and I couldn't very well
say it was a secretary's notion.

1454
01:22:45,377 --> 01:22:48,212
Anyway, the point is that
I'm trying to get you heard.

1455
01:22:48,589 --> 01:22:49,672
Oh.

1456
01:22:49,798 --> 01:22:51,215
What am I saying?

1457
01:22:51,425 --> 01:22:53,134
If you had seen it,

1458
01:22:53,218 --> 01:22:55,470
you simply would have
asked me about it.

1459
01:22:55,638 --> 01:22:56,679
Trust.

1460
01:23:00,517 --> 01:23:02,894
I'll need help
bathing and changing.

1461
01:23:06,065 --> 01:23:08,900
Oh, I need something
to cover this cast.

1462
01:23:09,276 --> 01:23:11,444
There's an afghan
on the chair.

1463
01:23:14,531 --> 01:23:15,740
Perfect.

1464
01:23:15,949 --> 01:23:17,325
If that
will be all...

1465
01:23:17,576 --> 01:23:18,826
Oh, and some perfume.

1466
01:23:19,119 --> 01:23:22,413
Uhh... shalimar.
on the dresser.

1467
01:23:24,208 --> 01:23:26,250
He loves shalimar.

1468
01:23:28,253 --> 01:23:29,420
He who?

1469
01:23:29,505 --> 01:23:30,672
Jack Trainer who.

1470
01:23:31,173 --> 01:23:32,757
He's on
his way over.

1471
01:23:33,384 --> 01:23:35,551
I have to go...
doctor's appointment.

1472
01:23:35,844 --> 01:23:36,969
Oh, one last thing...

1473
01:23:37,513 --> 01:23:39,889
Run to the drugstore
and get my pills.

1474
01:23:39,973 --> 01:23:41,432
I really
have to go.

1475
01:23:41,600 --> 01:23:43,226
The doctor
will understand.

1476
01:23:44,436 --> 01:23:45,561
Thanks.

1477
01:24:01,704 --> 01:24:03,162
Keep the change.

1478
01:24:11,964 --> 01:24:13,005
Who is it?

1479
01:24:13,132 --> 01:24:14,549
It's Jack.

1480
01:24:15,592 --> 01:24:17,135
[Buzz]

1481
01:24:24,309 --> 01:24:25,476
Katharine?

1482
01:24:25,769 --> 01:24:27,311
In the bedroom.

1483
01:24:32,317 --> 01:24:33,609
Jack.

1484
01:24:34,027 --> 01:24:35,027
Katharine.

1485
01:24:37,156 --> 01:24:39,115
Boy, did I ever
miss you.

1486
01:24:39,199 --> 01:24:40,366
Ha ha ha.

1487
01:24:41,410 --> 01:24:42,493
Does it hurt?

1488
01:24:42,661 --> 01:24:43,745
Look at you.

1489
01:24:43,829 --> 01:24:45,371
You said
it was urgent.

1490
01:24:45,456 --> 01:24:48,040
I'd forgotten how damn
handsome you are.

1491
01:24:49,042 --> 01:24:50,668
Thanks. Look, uh...

1492
01:24:51,253 --> 01:24:53,921
I meant what I said.
I'm really swamped...

1493
01:24:54,006 --> 01:24:57,425
Some welcome home.
I haven't even gotten a kiss.

1494
01:24:58,051 --> 01:24:59,343
Ha ha ha!

1495
01:25:01,305 --> 01:25:03,014
Ahh... hmm...

1496
01:25:05,017 --> 01:25:07,185
There's some champagne
in the little fridge.

1497
01:25:07,269 --> 01:25:09,187
You want to get it
for us?

1498
01:25:09,313 --> 01:25:13,191
Sure, and then
I really do have to go.

1499
01:25:27,539 --> 01:25:28,998
[Pop]

1500
01:25:29,958 --> 01:25:31,250
Where are
the glasses?

1501
01:25:31,752 --> 01:25:33,211
Try the dishwasher.

1502
01:25:43,764 --> 01:25:45,723
There you are.

1503
01:25:51,730 --> 01:25:53,064
You know
I love you.

1504
01:25:53,440 --> 01:25:54,857
You know that.

1505
01:25:56,443 --> 01:25:58,319
Katharine, I really do
have to get going.

1506
01:25:58,403 --> 01:25:59,612
These past few weeks,

1507
01:25:59,696 --> 01:26:03,324
I've heard this funny sound
down deep inside.

1508
01:26:04,243 --> 01:26:07,662
Tick-tock,
tick-tock, tick-tock.

1509
01:26:07,996 --> 01:26:09,789
My biological clock.

1510
01:26:10,123 --> 01:26:12,333
Big deal going.
Principals are meeting...

1511
01:26:12,417 --> 01:26:16,087
And I've been thinking...
let's merge...

1512
01:26:16,755 --> 01:26:18,047
you and I.

1513
01:26:18,590 --> 01:26:19,757
Think of it, darling.

1514
01:26:20,092 --> 01:26:22,593
Mr. and Mrs.
Fabulously Happy.

1515
01:26:24,471 --> 01:26:26,347
Katharine, it's really

1516
01:26:26,431 --> 01:26:28,182
not a good time
to talk.

1517
01:26:29,226 --> 01:26:30,434
You're right.

1518
01:26:32,020 --> 01:26:34,105
Can Big Jack
come out to play?

1519
01:26:34,606 --> 01:26:36,983
Little Jack really
has to get going.

1520
01:26:37,067 --> 01:26:39,193
Little Kate has been
so lonely.

1521
01:26:39,278 --> 01:26:41,112
No, no, no!

1522
01:26:41,613 --> 01:26:42,738
Jack!

1523
01:26:43,031 --> 01:26:44,615
What is it?

1524
01:26:45,951 --> 01:26:47,285
There's something
I have to tell you.

1525
01:26:47,369 --> 01:26:50,413
- There's someone else.
- Someone else?

1526
01:26:52,291 --> 01:26:54,375
Someone else that I have to be
meeting with

1527
01:26:54,459 --> 01:26:55,960
right now...
big deal going.

1528
01:26:56,044 --> 01:26:58,796
Can't be in two places
at the same time.

1529
01:26:58,922 --> 01:27:00,882
Talk to you later.
Bye.

1530
01:27:02,050 --> 01:27:03,551
Ha ha ha.

1531
01:27:13,520 --> 01:27:15,479
[Door Closes]

1532
01:27:16,023 --> 01:27:17,857
Here we are.

1533
01:27:24,907 --> 01:27:27,533
I've got to run.
Sorry. Bye.

1534
01:27:34,875 --> 01:27:36,167
Tess, you forgot your...

1535
01:27:36,251 --> 01:27:37,668
[Door Closes]

1536
01:27:39,338 --> 01:27:40,588
notebook.

1537
01:28:00,359 --> 01:28:03,694
That... little... slut!

1538
01:28:04,363 --> 01:28:07,031
Damn you,
bitch secretary!

1539
01:28:10,243 --> 01:28:12,495
Hi. I have a meeting
with Mr. Trask.

1540
01:28:12,579 --> 01:28:13,746
Your name, please.

1541
01:28:13,830 --> 01:28:14,997
Tess McGill.

1542
01:28:15,082 --> 01:28:17,541
- It's at the top of the stairs.
- Thank you.

1543
01:28:27,052 --> 01:28:28,844
- Miss... McGill.
- Yes.

1544
01:28:28,929 --> 01:28:29,971
Good afternoon.

1545
01:28:30,055 --> 01:28:31,639
Let me take
your coat.

1546
01:28:33,016 --> 01:28:34,225
Thank you.

1547
01:28:34,309 --> 01:28:35,726
This way, please.

1548
01:28:37,938 --> 01:28:39,397
Thank you.

1549
01:28:49,241 --> 01:28:50,282
Hi.

1550
01:28:50,367 --> 01:28:51,325
Hi.

1551
01:28:51,410 --> 01:28:52,493
Is everything O.K?

1552
01:28:52,577 --> 01:28:53,786
Yeah. Yeah.

1553
01:28:53,912 --> 01:28:56,038
You're the only one
from Petty here.

1554
01:28:56,123 --> 01:28:57,289
What's going on?

1555
01:28:57,374 --> 01:28:59,291
I'm flying solo
on this.

1556
01:28:59,626 --> 01:29:00,793
Good.

1557
01:29:01,336 --> 01:29:03,963
Armbrister and Trask
are in the corner.

1558
01:29:04,423 --> 01:29:06,924
We're waiting to see
what color smoke comes out.

1559
01:29:07,592 --> 01:29:08,968
Tell me something...

1560
01:29:09,052 --> 01:29:12,179
If a colleague
of mine had a strategy,

1561
01:29:12,264 --> 01:29:14,265
would you look at it
if I asked?

1562
01:29:14,808 --> 01:29:16,017
Yeah, sure.

1563
01:29:16,268 --> 01:29:17,643
No ethics problem?

1564
01:29:17,728 --> 01:29:19,937
You know, open to accusations
about stealing?

1565
01:29:20,772 --> 01:29:22,314
I look at stuff
all the time.

1566
01:29:22,399 --> 01:29:24,567
Nobody's ever
accused me of stealing.

1567
01:29:24,651 --> 01:29:25,693
What's it about?

1568
01:29:27,487 --> 01:29:29,030
Um... I don't know.

1569
01:29:29,114 --> 01:29:31,282
I'm so nervous
I can't...

1570
01:29:32,075 --> 01:29:33,325
stand still.

1571
01:29:34,995 --> 01:29:36,620
You'll be fine.

1572
01:29:40,917 --> 01:29:42,001
I love you.

1573
01:29:45,714 --> 01:29:47,339
I love you, too.

1574
01:29:49,885 --> 01:29:50,968
Gentlemen.

1575
01:30:10,906 --> 01:30:13,824
There was a story
on the news last night

1576
01:30:14,076 --> 01:30:17,411
showing life imitating
an old children's riddle.

1577
01:30:18,163 --> 01:30:21,916
It seems that a truck got stuck
at the entrance to the Holland Tunnel.

1578
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:23,918
Too high
for the clearance.

1579
01:30:24,169 --> 01:30:26,837
For hours, the experts
tried to find some way

1580
01:30:26,922 --> 01:30:30,007
to unwedge the vehicle,
but to no avail.

1581
01:30:30,842 --> 01:30:34,345
Finally, a 10-year-old girl
in a passing car

1582
01:30:34,596 --> 01:30:38,933
suggested letting the air
out of the truck's tires,

1583
01:30:39,392 --> 01:30:42,269
thus lowering it
to the clearance level,

1584
01:30:42,354 --> 01:30:44,855
which they did,
and it worked.

1585
01:30:44,940 --> 01:30:46,482
Ha ha ha!
Ha ha ha!

1586
01:30:47,609 --> 01:30:49,318
By letting
some of the air

1587
01:30:49,402 --> 01:30:52,738
out of our strategy
to expand into broadcasting,

1588
01:30:52,823 --> 01:30:54,949
Miss McGill
and Mr. Trainer

1589
01:30:55,575 --> 01:30:58,160
have effectively shown
all of us here at Trask

1590
01:30:58,245 --> 01:31:00,871
the light at the end
of our tunnel.

1591
01:31:01,540 --> 01:31:03,666
[Applause]

1592
01:31:06,336 --> 01:31:07,503
Uh, gentlemen,

1593
01:31:07,629 --> 01:31:09,130
and ladies,

1594
01:31:09,381 --> 01:31:11,590
I've decided
to sell Mr. Trask

1595
01:31:11,675 --> 01:31:13,134
the Metro Radio System

1596
01:31:13,260 --> 01:31:16,762
for $68.5 million
in cash and securities.

1597
01:31:17,139 --> 01:31:20,182
Now, of course, this is
an agreement in principle.

1598
01:31:20,308 --> 01:31:22,017
As to...
ha ha ha...

1599
01:31:22,102 --> 01:31:24,895
what constitutes principles
in this day and age,

1600
01:31:25,147 --> 01:31:28,232
I'll leave up to you barracudas
to squabble over.

1601
01:31:28,733 --> 01:31:30,025
Ha ha ha!
Ha ha ha!

1602
01:31:30,152 --> 01:31:32,194
[Katharine]
I'm certain they want to hear this!

1603
01:31:33,989 --> 01:31:36,031
This is a closed meeting,
and you can't...

1604
01:31:36,908 --> 01:31:38,367
Thank God
I'm here.

1605
01:31:38,535 --> 01:31:39,577
What's going on?

1606
01:31:39,661 --> 01:31:41,162
You're being tricked!

1607
01:31:41,663 --> 01:31:42,705
Katharine, what...

1608
01:31:42,789 --> 01:31:45,791
Jack, just trust me
and sit down.

1609
01:31:46,877 --> 01:31:48,252
My name
is Katharine Parker,

1610
01:31:48,336 --> 01:31:51,547
and I'm an associate partner in Mergers
and Acquisitions at Petty-Marsh,

1611
01:31:51,923 --> 01:31:54,300
and this woman
is my secretary.

1612
01:31:55,594 --> 01:31:56,719
She's not!

1613
01:31:57,012 --> 01:31:58,137
Oh, no?

1614
01:31:58,263 --> 01:31:59,263
Ask her.

1615
01:31:59,598 --> 01:32:01,515
You're not
her secretary.

1616
01:32:01,892 --> 01:32:03,767
I can explain, Jack.

1617
01:32:05,228 --> 01:32:07,563
Jesus. You are
her secretary.

1618
01:32:08,023 --> 01:32:10,357
While I was laid up
with broken bones,

1619
01:32:10,442 --> 01:32:11,942
she riffled
through my desk,

1620
01:32:12,027 --> 01:32:15,070
found my memo outlining
a Trask radio acquisition,

1621
01:32:15,155 --> 01:32:17,406
and has been passing it off
as her idea.

1622
01:32:17,490 --> 01:32:21,452
It was my idea.
She stole it from me, I swear.

1623
01:32:21,745 --> 01:32:24,872
Good God, Tess, don't you know
when to stop?

1624
01:32:25,123 --> 01:32:26,582
But you're lying!

1625
01:32:29,294 --> 01:32:30,419
Oh.

1626
01:32:37,469 --> 01:32:38,886
Thank you.

1627
01:32:40,305 --> 01:32:41,972
Oh, thank you.

1628
01:32:45,894 --> 01:32:47,311
Ahh.

1629
01:32:47,687 --> 01:32:49,355
Thank you all
so much.

1630
01:32:51,399 --> 01:32:53,859
The up side is
that I have found out

1631
01:32:53,944 --> 01:32:55,819
in time to control
the damage.

1632
01:32:55,946 --> 01:32:57,321
We have containment,

1633
01:32:57,405 --> 01:32:59,657
and we have a deal
on the table.

1634
01:32:59,991 --> 01:33:03,369
I say...
pass me a set of papers.

1635
01:33:03,620 --> 01:33:04,995
Let's get on with it.

1636
01:33:06,623 --> 01:33:08,082
Who's running
this thing?

1637
01:33:09,251 --> 01:33:11,502
Just... a second,
please.

1638
01:33:14,339 --> 01:33:16,173
I know you don't
believe me, but...

1639
01:33:18,218 --> 01:33:19,718
Oh, it doesn't matter.

1640
01:33:19,803 --> 01:33:21,011
I'm sorry.

1641
01:33:22,305 --> 01:33:23,514
I'm sorry.

1642
01:33:24,266 --> 01:33:25,474
I'm sorry.

1643
01:33:25,558 --> 01:33:27,017
I'm so sorry.

1644
01:33:43,201 --> 01:33:44,660
Ahem.

1645
01:33:47,872 --> 01:33:49,123
Ahem.

1646
01:33:50,125 --> 01:33:51,542
Well... gentlemen,

1647
01:33:53,545 --> 01:33:54,795
the players
may have changed

1648
01:33:54,879 --> 01:33:56,547
but the game
remains the same,

1649
01:33:56,631 --> 01:33:57,673
and the name
of the game

1650
01:33:57,757 --> 01:33:59,383
is let's make a deal.

1651
01:34:00,385 --> 01:34:03,137
If you'll all turn to page 22
in your prospectus,

1652
01:34:03,221 --> 01:34:06,223
I'd like to take you through
the terms of transferal.

1653
01:34:46,931 --> 01:34:49,099
[Bells Ringing]

1654
01:34:54,856 --> 01:34:56,774
Oh, hi!

1655
01:35:08,536 --> 01:35:10,996
Oh,
that's so nice!

1656
01:35:11,081 --> 01:35:12,289
Bye.

1657
01:35:12,457 --> 01:35:14,416
Bye.

1658
01:35:15,960 --> 01:35:17,753
Aah!
0hh!

1659
01:35:26,471 --> 01:35:28,389
[Horn Honks]

1660
01:35:36,106 --> 01:35:37,481
Well, they did it.

1661
01:35:38,525 --> 01:35:40,275
Yeah,
they sure did.

1662
01:35:42,320 --> 01:35:44,530
You really
look... great.

1663
01:35:45,865 --> 01:35:47,032
How are you?

1664
01:35:47,575 --> 01:35:48,575
Good.

1665
01:35:48,660 --> 01:35:49,785
Good.

1666
01:35:50,161 --> 01:35:51,954
Business is great,
and, uh...

1667
01:35:52,038 --> 01:35:53,080
Mick,
did you see me?

1668
01:35:53,164 --> 01:35:54,498
I caught it
one-handed.

1669
01:35:56,626 --> 01:35:57,835
Oh, hi.

1670
01:35:58,336 --> 01:35:59,711
Hey, Doreen.

1671
01:36:02,590 --> 01:36:04,591
My boat's booked
through three weeks from now.

1672
01:36:04,676 --> 01:36:06,135
Doreen's
working the lines.

1673
01:36:08,096 --> 01:36:09,346
That's great.

1674
01:36:09,639 --> 01:36:10,764
Really.

1675
01:36:12,517 --> 01:36:14,184
So how's life
in the fast lane?

1676
01:36:15,687 --> 01:36:18,021
Well, it's, um... fast.

1677
01:36:19,149 --> 01:36:21,442
It's real fast
and busy and...

1678
01:36:23,027 --> 01:36:24,653
It's good
to see you, Mick.

1679
01:36:25,196 --> 01:36:27,114
I guess
I better get.

1680
01:36:27,615 --> 01:36:29,408
It's good
to see you, too.

1681
01:37:13,745 --> 01:37:15,829
Cyn told us about
what happened.

1682
01:37:16,080 --> 01:37:18,916
It really bites
the big one, Tess.

1683
01:37:19,125 --> 01:37:21,210
We took up
a little collection.

1684
01:37:21,628 --> 01:37:23,420
- Thanks.
- It's not much.

1685
01:37:23,505 --> 01:37:25,339
It's just enough
to go get toasted

1686
01:37:25,423 --> 01:37:27,841
some night when
you really need it.

1687
01:37:28,176 --> 01:37:30,594
Don't say no.
We really wanted to.

1688
01:37:31,012 --> 01:37:32,971
No paying Con Ed
with it.

1689
01:37:35,266 --> 01:37:36,725
O.K., thanks.

1690
01:37:37,393 --> 01:37:39,520
So what are you
going to do now, huh?

1691
01:37:40,271 --> 01:37:42,022
Oh, you know...
play some golf,

1692
01:37:42,106 --> 01:37:43,774
redecorate
the country house.

1693
01:37:43,858 --> 01:37:44,942
Ha ha ha!

1694
01:37:46,611 --> 01:37:48,445
I don't know.
Start all over.

1695
01:37:49,405 --> 01:37:51,865
Find a job,
a place to live,

1696
01:37:52,450 --> 01:37:53,742
and just wise up

1697
01:37:53,826 --> 01:37:56,203
and not take the whole thing
so seriously.

1698
01:37:57,080 --> 01:37:58,539
I'll be O.K.

1699
01:38:00,458 --> 01:38:01,875
Ahem.

1700
01:38:03,795 --> 01:38:04,836
Bye.

1701
01:38:04,921 --> 01:38:06,338
Bye, sweetie.

1702
01:38:06,548 --> 01:38:08,173
- Thank you.
- We'll miss you.

1703
01:38:08,258 --> 01:38:09,299
Thanks.

1704
01:38:09,384 --> 01:38:10,717
So long, Tess.

1705
01:38:10,802 --> 01:38:12,302
Bye, Tess.

1706
01:38:13,429 --> 01:38:14,763
Don't work too hard!

1707
01:38:14,847 --> 01:38:15,973
Good-bye, Tess.

1708
01:38:27,110 --> 01:38:28,360
Ooh!

1709
01:38:28,486 --> 01:38:29,903
I'm sorry.

1710
01:38:30,238 --> 01:38:31,488
shit.

1711
01:38:36,995 --> 01:38:38,662
I've been trying
to find you.

1712
01:38:38,830 --> 01:38:40,163
Just leave
me alone.

1713
01:38:40,832 --> 01:38:42,291
Just one thing...

1714
01:38:42,584 --> 01:38:43,667
Was you and me

1715
01:38:43,751 --> 01:38:45,877
just part
of the scheme, too?

1716
01:38:46,212 --> 01:38:48,338
No!
Look, if I had told you

1717
01:38:48,423 --> 01:38:51,341
I was just some secretary, you
never would have taken the meeting.

1718
01:38:51,843 --> 01:38:54,845
Think about it. Maybe you would
have fed me a few drinks,

1719
01:38:54,929 --> 01:38:57,556
then tried to get me
into the sack, end of story.

1720
01:38:57,640 --> 01:38:58,682
That's not true.

1721
01:38:58,766 --> 01:39:00,225
Are you sure
about that?

1722
01:39:00,393 --> 01:39:03,270
Can you honestly tell me that
it wouldn't have made a difference?

1723
01:39:03,688 --> 01:39:05,188
Who's fooling who
here?

1724
01:39:05,273 --> 01:39:08,066
What's this,
more stolen files?

1725
01:39:09,027 --> 01:39:11,028
No. It's my stuff
from the desk.

1726
01:39:11,195 --> 01:39:12,321
Your stuff?

1727
01:39:12,572 --> 01:39:13,864
Now, there's
a broad term.

1728
01:39:13,990 --> 01:39:15,449
No. It's my stuff.

1729
01:39:15,617 --> 01:39:17,993
Maybe you can fool these guys
with this saint act,

1730
01:39:18,077 --> 01:39:21,413
but do not ever speak to me
like we don't know what happened.

1731
01:39:23,124 --> 01:39:25,042
Tess,
this is business.

1732
01:39:25,460 --> 01:39:27,878
Let's just bury
the hatchet, O.K?

1733
01:39:28,338 --> 01:39:30,130
Know where you
can bury it?

1734
01:39:30,256 --> 01:39:32,090
Get your bony ass
out of my sight.

1735
01:39:33,259 --> 01:39:36,386
If you think I said I loved you
as part of some scheme,

1736
01:39:36,471 --> 01:39:37,804
that's really pathetic!

1737
01:39:38,598 --> 01:39:40,599
My God.
She'll stop at nothing.

1738
01:39:40,933 --> 01:39:42,726
What kind of show
are you people running?

1739
01:39:42,810 --> 01:39:45,979
I'm sorry you had to see this,
but it means nothing to us.

1740
01:39:48,733 --> 01:39:50,233
Jack, let's get upstairs.

1741
01:39:51,944 --> 01:39:54,154
- Not without her.
- Jack.

1742
01:39:54,405 --> 01:39:57,157
Trainer, are you trying
to blow this deal?

1743
01:39:57,700 --> 01:40:00,994
No, sir. I'm trying to make sure
that it gets done right.

1744
01:40:01,079 --> 01:40:03,580
Tess is this team's leader.
She put this deal together.

1745
01:40:03,665 --> 01:40:05,123
We shouldn't proceed
without her.

1746
01:40:05,291 --> 01:40:07,000
You shouldn't
let your johnson

1747
01:40:07,085 --> 01:40:08,752
make business
decisions for you.

1748
01:40:09,754 --> 01:40:10,879
I'm not, sir.

1749
01:40:10,963 --> 01:40:12,255
I'm telling you,
she's your man.

1750
01:40:13,132 --> 01:40:14,925
What brings you
to that conclusion?

1751
01:40:15,218 --> 01:40:16,802
She said so,
and I believe her.

1752
01:40:17,053 --> 01:40:20,013
I'm afraid that's not good enough.
Are you with us or not?

1753
01:40:23,309 --> 01:40:24,434
No.

1754
01:40:26,104 --> 01:40:27,813
Jack, I forgive you.

1755
01:40:27,897 --> 01:40:29,898
Now get
on this elevator.

1756
01:40:31,609 --> 01:40:33,068
Sorry, Katharine.

1757
01:40:33,194 --> 01:40:34,861
You will be sorry,
Jack.

1758
01:40:38,157 --> 01:40:40,617
Ask her to tell you
about the hole in your deal.

1759
01:40:42,370 --> 01:40:43,412
What hole?

1760
01:40:43,496 --> 01:40:44,955
She's playing games.

1761
01:40:45,373 --> 01:40:46,456
Fine. Go.

1762
01:40:46,541 --> 01:40:48,875
- No. What hole?
- Look.

1763
01:40:50,712 --> 01:40:51,962
The people page?

1764
01:40:52,088 --> 01:40:53,964
Now this
is ridiculous.

1765
01:40:54,549 --> 01:40:57,884
"Former Miss America Dawn Bixby
has been house hunting here.

1766
01:40:57,969 --> 01:41:01,680
"Seems Dawn and hot, hot,
hot DJ-hubby Slim Slicker

1767
01:41:01,764 --> 01:41:04,558
are getting ready to take
a bite out of the Big Apple."

1768
01:41:04,642 --> 01:41:05,642
So?

1769
01:41:05,852 --> 01:41:08,812
Slim Slicker's
one of Metro's major assets.

1770
01:41:09,272 --> 01:41:11,857
Syndicated
to all their stations.

1771
01:41:11,941 --> 01:41:13,734
The cornerstone
of their programming.

1772
01:41:13,818 --> 01:41:17,237
You lose him and Metro's just
O.K. real estate with falling ratings,

1773
01:41:17,321 --> 01:41:19,322
and you're not buying it
for a write-off.

1774
01:41:19,615 --> 01:41:21,908
Better make sure he's locked in
before they sign anything.

1775
01:41:22,160 --> 01:41:23,702
Oren,
I have this covered.

1776
01:41:23,786 --> 01:41:25,203
Upstairs, shall we?

1777
01:41:26,080 --> 01:41:27,205
Oren!

1778
01:41:27,331 --> 01:41:28,832
Hear the lady out,
sir.

1779
01:41:29,000 --> 01:41:30,542
There's
another elevator.

1780
01:41:38,176 --> 01:41:39,634
You're on.

1781
01:41:43,890 --> 01:41:44,973
O.K.

1782
01:41:45,433 --> 01:41:46,808
See, this is Forbes.

1783
01:41:46,893 --> 01:41:48,143
It's just
your basic article

1784
01:41:48,227 --> 01:41:51,021
about how you were looking
to expand into broadcasting.

1785
01:41:52,273 --> 01:41:53,398
The same day...
I'll never forget this...

1786
01:41:53,524 --> 01:41:55,317
I'm reading page 6
of the Post.

1787
01:41:55,401 --> 01:41:57,068
There's this item
on Bobby Stein,

1788
01:41:57,153 --> 01:41:59,446
the radio talk show guy
who does all those gross jokes

1789
01:41:59,530 --> 01:42:01,740
about Ethiopia
and the Betty Ford Center.

1790
01:42:01,824 --> 01:42:04,117
He's hosting
this charity auction...

1791
01:42:04,202 --> 01:42:05,786
real blue bloods.

1792
01:42:06,537 --> 01:42:09,164
Now I turn the page to Susie,
who does the society stuff,

1793
01:42:09,248 --> 01:42:10,582
and there's this picture
of your daughter.

1794
01:42:11,876 --> 01:42:14,377
She's helping to organize
the charity ball,

1795
01:42:14,462 --> 01:42:15,796
so I started to think,

1796
01:42:15,880 --> 01:42:18,590
"Trask. Radio.
Trask, radio."

1797
01:42:19,342 --> 01:42:21,051
Then I hooked up
with Jack,

1798
01:42:21,135 --> 01:42:23,053
and he came on board
with Metro,

1799
01:42:23,137 --> 01:42:25,889
and, and...
so now, here we are.

1800
01:42:39,570 --> 01:42:42,572
Oren, we don't have
any more time for fairy tales.

1801
01:42:42,907 --> 01:42:45,408
Miss Parker,
let me ask you a question.

1802
01:42:46,369 --> 01:42:47,828
How did you
come up with the idea

1803
01:42:47,912 --> 01:42:49,579
for Trask
to buy out Metro?

1804
01:42:50,498 --> 01:42:51,957
How did I, uh...

1805
01:42:53,417 --> 01:42:55,168
Well, let's see.

1806
01:42:55,253 --> 01:42:56,378
The, um...

1807
01:42:57,588 --> 01:42:58,880
[Oren]
The impulse.

1808
01:42:59,215 --> 01:43:01,091
What led you
to put the two together?

1809
01:43:03,219 --> 01:43:05,095
I would have
to check my files.

1810
01:43:05,179 --> 01:43:07,389
I can't recall
exactly the, um...

1811
01:43:07,765 --> 01:43:11,184
It's not as if
it was in the mainstream.

1812
01:43:12,895 --> 01:43:15,689
You know, it would have
to be the, um...

1813
01:43:18,442 --> 01:43:20,694
Jack,
help me out here.

1814
01:43:25,658 --> 01:43:27,325
Oren,
I beg your pardon,

1815
01:43:28,244 --> 01:43:29,452
but if... if you
are insinuating...

1816
01:43:29,662 --> 01:43:31,580
If I were you,

1817
01:43:31,873 --> 01:43:35,125
I'd go to your office
and take a long, last look around.

1818
01:43:35,710 --> 01:43:37,127
Because in five minutes,

1819
01:43:37,378 --> 01:43:38,545
I'm going to
see to it

1820
01:43:38,629 --> 01:43:40,922
that you get the boot,
but good.

1821
01:43:41,924 --> 01:43:44,551
Oren, this is a simple
misunderstanding.

1822
01:43:44,635 --> 01:43:45,594
You cannot...

1823
01:43:45,845 --> 01:43:47,596
I can, and I will!

1824
01:43:47,972 --> 01:43:49,389
Now get your...

1825
01:43:49,640 --> 01:43:50,682
What did you
call it?

1826
01:43:51,392 --> 01:43:52,642
- Bony ass.
- Bony ass.

1827
01:43:53,144 --> 01:43:54,227
Right.

1828
01:43:54,312 --> 01:43:56,521
Bony ass
out of my sight.

1829
01:43:57,481 --> 01:43:58,690
I'm sorry,

1830
01:43:59,650 --> 01:44:01,026
but I simply
won't stand

1831
01:44:01,110 --> 01:44:02,527
for that kind
of talk.

1832
01:44:05,239 --> 01:44:07,157
Will you
excuse me, please?

1833
01:44:17,251 --> 01:44:18,376
[Door Closes]

1834
01:44:18,461 --> 01:44:21,004
Why didn't you tell us this
in the board room?

1835
01:44:21,505 --> 01:44:24,132
No one was going to listen,
sir, not to me.

1836
01:44:24,550 --> 01:44:26,801
You can bend the rules
once you get upstairs,

1837
01:44:26,886 --> 01:44:28,345
but not while you're
trying to get there.

1838
01:44:28,429 --> 01:44:31,598
And if you're like me, you can't
get there without bending the rules.

1839
01:44:32,016 --> 01:44:33,808
You've got fire
in your belly.

1840
01:44:34,185 --> 01:44:36,561
Or was this a one-time stunt
that you pulled?

1841
01:44:37,980 --> 01:44:39,230
I'm not sure what you mean.

1842
01:44:39,315 --> 01:44:42,067
I have something in my belly,
but I think it's nervous knots.

1843
01:44:42,777 --> 01:44:44,945
Are you willing to go
out on that limb every day,

1844
01:44:45,029 --> 01:44:46,863
working for me,
legitimately?

1845
01:44:47,865 --> 01:44:48,949
Yes, sir.

1846
01:44:49,033 --> 01:44:50,241
Have to be right
at the entry level.

1847
01:44:50,326 --> 01:44:51,451
Have any problem
with that?

1848
01:44:51,535 --> 01:44:52,619
No, sir.

1849
01:44:53,245 --> 01:44:54,704
Gumption, Miss McGill.

1850
01:44:55,039 --> 01:44:56,164
Yes, sir.

1851
01:44:56,374 --> 01:44:57,457
See you tomorrow.

1852
01:44:57,541 --> 01:44:58,541
O.K.

1853
01:44:59,085 --> 01:45:00,335
Trainer. Dwayne.

1854
01:45:00,419 --> 01:45:01,586
Let's go back
to my office

1855
01:45:01,671 --> 01:45:03,672
and see about this
Slim what's his name's contract.

1856
01:45:03,756 --> 01:45:05,215
Be right
with you, sir.

1857
01:45:10,513 --> 01:45:12,222
- Aww.
- Aww.

1858
01:45:12,306 --> 01:45:14,474
Way to go, Tess.
Way to go.

1859
01:45:14,558 --> 01:45:15,475
Beauty!

1860
01:45:41,419 --> 01:45:42,752
For you.

1861
01:45:43,421 --> 01:45:44,462
You like it?

1862
01:45:44,588 --> 01:45:46,006
Ha ha ha!

1863
01:45:47,925 --> 01:45:49,718
Peanut butter
and jelly sandwich.

1864
01:45:51,012 --> 01:45:52,595
Milk money.

1865
01:45:53,597 --> 01:45:54,889
Twinkies.

1866
01:45:55,933 --> 01:45:57,434
Pen, pencil, ruler.

1867
01:45:57,518 --> 01:45:59,060
Apple
for the teacher.

1868
01:45:59,437 --> 01:46:01,229
Now, remember...

1869
01:46:01,480 --> 01:46:03,273
Play nice
with the other kids.

1870
01:46:04,025 --> 01:46:05,859
Make sure you're home
before dark.

1871
01:46:19,415 --> 01:46:20,832
Hi. Tess McGill.

1872
01:46:20,958 --> 01:46:21,916
Good morning.

1873
01:46:22,001 --> 01:46:23,001
Good morning.

1874
01:46:23,085 --> 01:46:24,711
The director's
out sick today.

1875
01:46:24,795 --> 01:46:26,796
She'll see you
first thing tomorrow.

1876
01:46:28,007 --> 01:46:29,966
Miss Baxter's
already up there.

1877
01:46:30,634 --> 01:46:32,385
She'll show you
the layout.

1878
01:46:32,845 --> 01:46:34,804
It's at the end
of the hall.

1879
01:46:35,222 --> 01:46:36,306
Thank you.

1880
01:46:36,515 --> 01:46:37,891
You're welcome.

1881
01:46:47,985 --> 01:46:50,403
Anybody will be an improvement
over that terrorist.

1882
01:46:50,780 --> 01:46:53,698
I mean...
something semihuman.

1883
01:47:04,418 --> 01:47:05,460
Oh.

1884
01:47:05,878 --> 01:47:07,504
I didn't
hear you come in.

1885
01:47:08,255 --> 01:47:09,714
I'm Alice Baxter.

1886
01:47:09,799 --> 01:47:11,299
Tess McGill.

1887
01:47:11,675 --> 01:47:14,219
I was just...
using the phone.

1888
01:47:15,179 --> 01:47:17,680
Yes, well...
that happens.

1889
01:47:18,557 --> 01:47:19,849
How about
some coffee?

1890
01:47:20,059 --> 01:47:21,518
Sure,
just tell me where.

1891
01:47:21,894 --> 01:47:23,353
No. I'll get it.

1892
01:47:23,854 --> 01:47:25,021
Oh. How?

1893
01:47:25,356 --> 01:47:27,023
Milk and sugar, please.

1894
01:47:27,316 --> 01:47:28,566
Thank you.

1895
01:47:49,338 --> 01:47:52,048
Uh... Miss McGill?

1896
01:47:52,133 --> 01:47:53,216
Yes?

1897
01:47:53,717 --> 01:47:55,009
That's your desk...

1898
01:47:56,137 --> 01:47:57,303
in there.

1899
01:47:57,721 --> 01:47:59,180
I don't think so.

1900
01:47:59,765 --> 01:48:02,392
Oh, yes.
I sit out here.

1901
01:48:03,102 --> 01:48:04,102
I'm sorry.

1902
01:48:04,186 --> 01:48:05,145
I thought
the secretary

1903
01:48:05,229 --> 01:48:06,271
would sit out here.

1904
01:48:07,148 --> 01:48:08,314
That's right.

1905
01:48:08,399 --> 01:48:09,899
I'm the secretary.

1906
01:48:11,402 --> 01:48:13,528
If it's O.K.,
I prefer "assistant."

1907
01:48:29,712 --> 01:48:33,173
You've got a 10:00 meeting
with Slater,

1908
01:48:33,257 --> 01:48:35,800
11:00 with Donahue
from Logistics...

1909
01:48:35,885 --> 01:48:37,510
his office on 23...

1910
01:48:37,595 --> 01:48:39,012
and lunch
with Mr. Trask,

1911
01:48:39,096 --> 01:48:41,014
his office downtown,
1:00.

1912
01:48:42,516 --> 01:48:44,267
It's all right there
in the computer.

1913
01:48:44,351 --> 01:48:46,895
Just hit shift "S"
for your schedule.

1914
01:48:54,111 --> 01:48:56,779
Um... When I saw you

1915
01:48:57,573 --> 01:49:00,575
in here on the phone
with your feet up,

1916
01:49:00,784 --> 01:49:03,036
I figured this
was your office.

1917
01:49:04,872 --> 01:49:06,748
I'm sorry about that,
Miss McGill.

1918
01:49:06,957 --> 01:49:09,042
It won't happen
again... ever.

1919
01:49:09,126 --> 01:49:10,543
It's O.K.

1920
01:49:12,129 --> 01:49:13,588
Maybe now would
be a good time

1921
01:49:13,672 --> 01:49:15,340
to go over what you
expect of me.

1922
01:49:17,968 --> 01:49:18,968
Uh...

1923
01:49:19,053 --> 01:49:20,303
Ahem.

1924
01:49:21,347 --> 01:49:24,807
I, uh, I expect you
to call me Tess.

1925
01:49:25,351 --> 01:49:27,143
I don't expect you
to fetch me coffee

1926
01:49:27,228 --> 01:49:29,520
unless you're getting
some for yourself,

1927
01:49:29,605 --> 01:49:30,939
and, um...

1928
01:49:32,233 --> 01:49:35,777
the rest we'll just
make up as we go along.

1929
01:49:36,862 --> 01:49:37,987
O.K?

1930
01:49:41,325 --> 01:49:42,492
O.K.

1931
01:49:44,745 --> 01:49:47,705
I'll be right outside
if you need anything.

1932
01:49:48,165 --> 01:49:49,499
Fine.

1933
01:50:01,345 --> 01:50:02,595
Cyn.

1934
01:50:03,180 --> 01:50:05,139
Guess where I am.

1935
01:50:05,266 --> 01:50:06,683
Ha ha!

1936
01:50:08,686 --> 01:50:12,522
Let the river run

1937
01:50:12,856 --> 01:50:19,028
Let all the dreamers
wake the nation

1938
01:50:19,196 --> 01:50:27,537
Come the New Jerusalem

1939
01:50:29,873 --> 01:50:34,085
Silver cities rise

1940
01:50:34,169 --> 01:50:36,796
The morning lights

1941
01:50:36,880 --> 01:50:40,049
The streets
that lead them

1942
01:50:40,134 --> 01:50:42,302
And sirens

1943
01:50:42,386 --> 01:50:44,304
Call them on

1944
01:50:44,388 --> 01:50:48,349
With a song

1945
01:50:50,769 --> 01:50:54,522
It's asking
for the taking

1946
01:50:56,400 --> 01:51:01,696
Trembling, shaking

1947
01:51:01,780 --> 01:51:06,409
Oh, my heart is aching

1948
01:51:06,702 --> 01:51:07,952
We're coming to the edge

1949
01:51:08,037 --> 01:51:09,620
Running on the water

1950
01:51:09,747 --> 01:51:12,749
Coming through the fog,
your sons and daughters

1951
01:51:12,833 --> 01:51:16,502
We, the great and small

1952
01:51:16,587 --> 01:51:19,297
Stand on a star

1953
01:51:19,381 --> 01:51:24,761
And blaze a trail
of desire

1954
01:51:24,928 --> 01:51:31,768
Through the darkening dawn

1955
01:51:33,145 --> 01:51:38,274
It's asking
for the taking

1956
01:51:38,442 --> 01:51:39,942
Come run with me now

1957
01:51:40,069 --> 01:51:41,861
The sky is the color
of blue

1958
01:51:41,945 --> 01:51:44,489
You've never even seen
in the eyes of your lover

1959
01:51:44,573 --> 01:51:49,077
Oh, my heart is aching

1960
01:51:49,161 --> 01:51:50,411
We're coming
to the edge

1961
01:51:50,496 --> 01:51:52,163
Running on the water

1962
01:51:52,247 --> 01:51:55,083
Coming through the fog,
your sons and daughters

1963
01:52:15,687 --> 01:52:21,275
It's asking
for the taking

1964
01:52:21,360 --> 01:52:26,572
Trembling, shaking

1965
01:52:26,657 --> 01:52:31,577
Oh, my heart is aching

1966
01:52:31,662 --> 01:52:32,912
We're coming to the edge

1967
01:52:32,996 --> 01:52:34,580
Running on the water

1968
01:52:34,665 --> 01:52:37,291
Coming through the fog,
your sons and daughters

1969
01:52:37,376 --> 01:52:39,961
Let the river run

1970
01:52:40,045 --> 01:52:41,712
Let the river run

1971
01:52:41,797 --> 01:52:43,756
Let all the dreamers
wake the nation

1972
01:52:43,841 --> 01:52:47,844
Let all the dreamers
wake the nation

1973
01:52:47,928 --> 01:52:57,854
Come the New Jerusalem
