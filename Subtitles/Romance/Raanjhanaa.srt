0
00:01:28,750 --> 00:01:33,000
Just like we need to breathe..

1
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:37,500
Just like we need to breathe..

2
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,582
..to live, all I want is a sweetheart..

3
00:01:42,082 --> 00:01:44,332
When you're on the verge of dying..

4
00:01:44,832 --> 00:01:48,125
..you'll realise some important facts of life.

5
00:01:48,625 --> 00:01:50,665
And, one of them would be..

6
00:01:51,165 --> 00:01:54,290
..that, girls and rockets can take you any limits.

7
00:01:54,790 --> 00:01:56,665
Look, that's me.

8
00:01:57,165 --> 00:02:01,207
'They completely rearranged my face.'

9
00:02:01,707 --> 00:02:05,165
'30 minutes ago, I was standing on my own two feet.'

10
00:02:05,665 --> 00:02:06,832
'Just 20 minutes ago, they 11 bones..'

11
00:02:07,332 --> 00:02:08,625
..and cracked my skull.

12
00:02:09,125 --> 00:02:10,540
'Murari was right.'

13
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:12,665
'This mess was created by me.'

14
00:02:13,165 --> 00:02:15,832
'But someone's love had become the bane of my life.'

15
00:02:16,332 --> 00:02:19,207
'But my story doesn't start here.'

16
00:02:19,707 --> 00:02:23,625
'My story starts at Beneras.'

17
00:02:24,125 --> 00:02:27,707
'All hail Lord Shiva. - All hail Lord Shiva.'

18
00:02:28,207 --> 00:02:30,207
'All hail Lord Shiva.'

19
00:02:30,707 --> 00:02:32,582
'I was a free soul.'

20
00:02:33,082 --> 00:02:35,165
It was not just difficult but impossible to catch me.'

21
00:02:35,665 --> 00:02:37,290
'All hail Lord Shiva. All hail Lord Shiva.'

22
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:39,375
'All hail, sir.'

23
00:02:39,875 --> 00:02:41,415
Uncle Rameshwar, out with some money.

24
00:02:41,915 --> 00:02:42,957
This time we'll burn Ravana's effigy in a way..

25
00:02:43,457 --> 00:02:45,375
..that no one would dare to burn Ravana's effigy again.

26
00:02:45,875 --> 00:02:47,540
But why are you dressed like Lord Shiva to ask..

27
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:49,540
..for donation for Dussehra?

28
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:50,750
You should have dressed up like Rama, right?

29
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:54,582
Would Rama himself have come to ask for donation..

30
00:02:55,082 --> 00:02:56,875
..to save his own wife?

31
00:02:57,375 --> 00:02:58,207
Would he have liked that?

32
00:02:58,707 --> 00:02:59,457
That's why he sent me.

33
00:02:59,957 --> 00:03:02,540
After all, I am His special friend. Am I not?

34
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:03,665
Here you go.

35
00:03:04,165 --> 00:03:05,040
All hail Lord Shiva.

36
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:07,540
Bindiya. Brother, did you see Bindiya?

37
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:09,207
No. <br /> That Kundan will spoil her.

38
00:03:09,707 --> 00:03:11,332
Hide, hide. - Bindiya.

39
00:03:11,832 --> 00:03:13,540
Seems like your father has come, Bindiya.

40
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:16,165
Go. Or else all of us would get beaten up because of you.

41
00:03:16,665 --> 00:03:18,790
You are scared because my father is a policeman, isn't it?

42
00:03:19,290 --> 00:03:20,957
I am scared of nobody.

43
00:03:21,457 --> 00:03:23,000
Your father has messed up my life.

44
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:25,250
Okay. Hold on. I'll call him.

45
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:26,665
Papa.

46
00:03:27,165 --> 00:03:28,500
Please. Quiet. Quiet.

47
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,540
I shall be doomed if I don't rip off your father's clothes one day.

48
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:33,040
Come on.

49
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:35,332
All hail Lord Shiva.

50
00:03:35,832 --> 00:03:38,207
Uncle, we've come from the third lane of Hanuman Phatak.

51
00:03:38,707 --> 00:03:41,540
For donation. As we have to burn Ravana's effigy.

52
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:42,540
Hope you won't burn down someone else.

53
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:45,875
Uncle, if you think this is a lie. You can come there and check.

54
00:03:46,375 --> 00:03:47,207
Give it. Give him the receipt.

55
00:03:47,707 --> 00:03:49,125
Here. 100 rupees.

56
00:03:49,625 --> 00:03:52,750
Okay. Junaid. Get 100 rupees. - Yes.

57
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:56,750
Murari, we...

58
00:04:04,790 --> 00:04:08,582
'That day, that very moment, that very second..'

59
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:12,207
'..it felt as if Lord Shiva had answered all my prayers. '

60
00:04:12,707 --> 00:04:14,500
'200 years ago the king of Banaras had brought..'

61
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,708
'..my forefathers from a village in Tamil Nadu.'

62
00:04:17,208 --> 00:04:19,165
'To be his personal priests.'

63
00:04:19,665 --> 00:04:22,208
'But it felt as if Banaras had accepted me today.'

64
00:04:22,708 --> 00:04:24,958
'This was Banaras's first gift to me.'

65
00:04:25,458 --> 00:04:26,583
'She was the one offering prayers..'

66
00:04:27,083 --> 00:04:29,540
'..but it felt as if my prayers had been answered.'

67
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:31,583
'I was still a kid.'

68
00:04:32,083 --> 00:04:33,750
'But all of a sudden it felt as if I was an adult.'

69
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:35,375
'Old enough to marry.'

70
00:04:35,875 --> 00:04:39,375
'Old enough to live and die in that girl's love.'

71
00:05:17,458 --> 00:05:21,040
All I demand is you.

72
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:25,415
All my immaturity is limited to you.

73
00:05:25,915 --> 00:05:31,415
All my eyes look for are you.

74
00:05:31,915 --> 00:05:34,750
You give me joy as well sorrow.

75
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:42,125
Only you. Only you. Sweetheart.

76
00:05:42,625 --> 00:05:46,250
All I want is you. But it's all up to you.

77
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:49,915
All I want is you. But it's all up to you.

78
00:05:50,415 --> 00:05:54,125
All my hardships are limited to you.

79
00:05:54,625 --> 00:05:58,165
All my intelligence is limited to you.

80
00:05:58,665 --> 00:06:02,540
All I prepare for is you. Only you.

81
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:06,583
Only you.

82
00:06:07,083 --> 00:06:10,583
I am smitten by you and you only.

83
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:37,500
You dare tease the girl of our territory.

84
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,500
Dogs have territories. - Lions have guts.

85
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:43,790
Darn you.

86
00:06:44,290 --> 00:06:45,040
Hey...don't beat me. Okay.

87
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:47,125
I will beat you to an inch of your life.

88
00:06:47,625 --> 00:06:51,040
Murrari. Don't let them get away. Catch him.

89
00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:54,000
Look aunt, these scoundrels have been beaten up again.

90
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:55,250
They were teasing with girls.

91
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:57,208
Aunty, we only fell down, She's lying.

92
00:06:57,708 --> 00:07:12,540
Delicate. And shy. Delicate. My heart lets out a tune.

93
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:18,790
Your eyes are mesmeric.

94
00:07:19,290 --> 00:07:22,958
Don't give me those mesmeric looks.

95
00:07:23,458 --> 00:07:27,958
Don't give me those mesmeric looks.

96
00:07:28,458 --> 00:07:31,375
To you. All the roads lead to you.

97
00:07:31,875 --> 00:07:35,500
I'm drawn to you. All I want is to meet you.

98
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:44,915
I'll meet you. Only you. Only you.

99
00:07:45,415 --> 00:07:55,583
Fiery face. And the dark eyes.

100
00:07:56,083 --> 00:07:59,540
We fight and squabble.

101
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:03,625
You seem to be mine. And sometimes you seem like a dream.

102
00:08:04,125 --> 00:08:08,665
When you look at me.

103
00:08:09,165 --> 00:08:17,290
Your eyes pierce straight through my heart.

104
00:08:17,790 --> 00:08:25,583
You control my destiny.

105
00:08:26,083 --> 00:08:33,916
How do I get out of this dilemma?

106
00:08:34,416 --> 00:08:41,541
How do I get out of this dilemma?

107
00:08:42,041 --> 00:08:45,707
Only you. Only you. Only you, sweetheart.

108
00:08:46,207 --> 00:08:49,875
Only you. Only you. Only you, sweetheart.

109
00:08:50,375 --> 00:08:54,041
All I want is you. But it's all up to you.

110
00:08:54,541 --> 00:08:57,666
All I want is you. But it's all up to you.

111
00:08:58,166 --> 00:09:01,875
All my hardships are limited to you.

112
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:06,041
All my intelligence is limited to you.

113
00:09:06,541 --> 00:09:10,207
All I prepare for is you. Only you.

114
00:09:10,707 --> 00:09:14,375
Only you.

115
00:09:14,875 --> 00:09:19,582
I am smitten by you and you only.

116
00:09:20,082 --> 00:09:25,750
Only you. Only you.

117
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:27,166
Someone will take your girl away.

118
00:09:27,666 --> 00:09:29,666
And you will be left licking your wounds.

119
00:09:30,166 --> 00:09:30,832
What do you mean?

120
00:09:31,332 --> 00:09:32,457
I mean if you don't express it now..

121
00:09:32,957 --> 00:09:34,625
..you'll be seen eating sweets in the girl's wedding.

122
00:09:35,125 --> 00:09:36,207
Only you.

123
00:09:36,707 --> 00:09:37,916
Sanju!

124
00:09:38,416 --> 00:09:41,791
Only you. Only you.

125
00:09:42,291 --> 00:09:43,875
My smartness is limited to you.

126
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:45,957
My youth is all for you.

127
00:09:46,457 --> 00:09:48,000
My smartness is limited to you.

128
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:50,125
My youth is all for you.

129
00:09:50,625 --> 00:09:52,207
My story ends on you.

130
00:09:52,707 --> 00:09:54,541
My story ends only on you.

131
00:09:55,041 --> 00:09:59,291
Only you. Only you.

132
00:09:59,791 --> 00:10:02,957
Only you. Only you.

133
00:10:03,457 --> 00:10:06,957
Only you. Only you.

134
00:10:11,625 --> 00:10:13,541
I love you.

135
00:10:14,041 --> 00:10:17,957
Did he scare you? Go.

136
00:10:18,457 --> 00:10:21,457
I'll slap you and you'll stop flirting around.

137
00:10:21,957 --> 00:10:25,457
I am prepared for that. Here.

138
00:10:29,291 --> 00:10:30,041
Tell me your name at least.

139
00:10:30,541 --> 00:10:36,332
Come tomorrow again to get slapped and I'll tell you.

140
00:10:36,832 --> 00:10:44,541
I'm in love. Someone come and check on me.

141
00:10:45,041 --> 00:10:53,666
I'm in love. Someone come and check on me.

142
00:10:54,166 --> 00:11:00,707
I locked eyes with her smack in the middle of the market.

143
00:11:01,207 --> 00:11:09,791
I'm in love. Someone come and check on me.

144
00:11:10,291 --> 00:11:20,707
I have locked eyes at a tender age.

145
00:11:21,207 --> 00:11:22,750
It's my last board paper tomorrow. - Very nice.

146
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:24,375
Come and meet me at the fort at Ganga's banks.

147
00:11:24,875 --> 00:11:26,291
At 5.

148
00:11:26,791 --> 00:11:30,207
And listen. I'm meeting you because of your consistency.

149
00:11:30,707 --> 00:11:31,707
Not out of love.

150
00:11:32,207 --> 00:11:34,957
No matter the reason. Just meet me.

151
00:11:35,457 --> 00:11:37,582
Leave the rest to destiny.

152
00:11:38,082 --> 00:11:40,125
You have slapped me 15 times. Tell me your name at least now.

153
00:11:40,625 --> 00:11:42,541
Zoya. - Zoya.

154
00:11:43,041 --> 00:11:46,707
And yours? - Rizwan.

155
00:11:47,207 --> 00:11:50,750
Rizwan.

156
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:53,416
Oh my! You look cool.

157
00:11:53,916 --> 00:11:54,750
Why? Can't I?

158
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:57,666
No. You can. Why not?

159
00:11:58,166 --> 00:12:01,291
But mister, I know whom you are pursuing.

160
00:12:01,791 --> 00:12:04,500
Heard that you're going to the fort today to show that witch the moon.

161
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:05,625
You are a witch. Get lost.

162
00:12:06,125 --> 00:12:11,541
Great. Great. Love her and beat me. - Lay off.

163
00:12:12,041 --> 00:12:14,582
You are looking nice, mister.

164
00:12:15,082 --> 00:12:15,916
If that witch casts an evil eye on you..

165
00:12:16,416 --> 00:12:17,500
..then you'll have to marry me.

166
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,666
Why don't you ever show me the moon?

167
00:12:21,166 --> 00:12:22,291
Go count the stars, Bindiya.

168
00:12:22,791 --> 00:12:26,541
Go to hell.

169
00:12:27,041 --> 00:12:29,375
Your heartbeat is saying something.

170
00:12:29,875 --> 00:12:32,957
It says something...

171
00:12:33,457 --> 00:12:36,957
Your heartbeat is saying something.

172
00:13:14,707 --> 00:13:15,875
What happened?

173
00:13:16,375 --> 00:13:18,666
What is this?

174
00:13:19,166 --> 00:13:22,332
I bought the I love you card in haste. Thought you would take offence.

175
00:13:22,832 --> 00:13:26,832
So I bought this. - You are a bumpkin.

176
00:13:27,332 --> 00:13:30,832
Is this any way to propose to a girl?

177
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:48,250
Listen to your heart first. Then let your eyes take control.

178
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:52,332
Your heartbeat is saying something.

179
00:13:52,832 --> 00:13:56,332
I suggest you should listen to your heart.

180
00:14:02,791 --> 00:14:08,332
Your eyes are glistening in the sun.

181
00:14:08,832 --> 00:14:12,332
The sun...

182
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,416
The sun...

183
00:14:16,916 --> 00:14:18,375
Sorry, I forgot.

184
00:14:18,875 --> 00:14:22,375
If this is you...then I have been smitten by you.

185
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:41,125
What is your name? - Rizwan.

186
00:14:41,625 --> 00:14:44,875
And your father's?

187
00:14:45,375 --> 00:14:47,666
Mirza Galib.

188
00:14:48,166 --> 00:14:51,582
You didn't think? Did you?

189
00:14:52,082 --> 00:14:53,500
'This was the sixteenth slap.'

190
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,541
'But I was happy to have kissed her.'

191
00:14:56,041 --> 00:14:57,250
'Rather than be sad about the slap.'

192
00:14:57,750 --> 00:14:58,500
I hate liars.

193
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,707
'What could be better than a wife of sound character?'

194
00:15:02,207 --> 00:15:05,291
'But I was a Banerasi priest. Dark at that.'

195
00:15:05,791 --> 00:15:07,332
How could I accept defeat?

196
00:15:07,832 --> 00:15:10,166
In U.P. girls are cajoled in two ways.

197
00:15:10,666 --> 00:15:12,875
First is dedication. Follow her around all day.

198
00:15:13,375 --> 00:15:15,666
Write love letters, and ask her friend to deliver it.

199
00:15:16,166 --> 00:15:19,666
But, every boy in U.P was doing that.

200
00:15:20,166 --> 00:15:21,582
'But I wasn't a handsome hunk.'

201
00:15:22,082 --> 00:15:23,500
'To have passed by doing all this.'

202
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:24,707
'So I failed.'

203
00:15:25,207 --> 00:15:26,457
Now, the second way.

204
00:15:26,957 --> 00:15:28,082
Scaring the girl.

205
00:15:28,582 --> 00:15:29,291
What are you doing?

206
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:30,791
If you stop the vehicle you'll not be able to drive it from tomorrow.

207
00:15:31,291 --> 00:15:32,582
What's the problem? - You're the problem.

208
00:15:33,082 --> 00:15:34,582
Don't chase me around. - So whom should I chase?

209
00:15:35,082 --> 00:15:38,041
I don't know. But don't chase me.

210
00:15:38,541 --> 00:15:39,625
Say that you don't love me.

211
00:15:40,125 --> 00:15:41,041
I don't love you.

212
00:15:41,541 --> 00:15:43,791
Just because I am a Hindu.

213
00:15:44,291 --> 00:15:45,500
If you say I'll read out the Kalma(holy book).

214
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,875
You are a liar.

215
00:15:50,375 --> 00:15:57,041
Say that you don't love me. Or I'll slit the wrist.

216
00:15:57,541 --> 00:15:59,666
Mine.

217
00:16:00,166 --> 00:16:03,666
I don't love you.

218
00:16:30,166 --> 00:16:31,957
What are you doing?

219
00:16:32,457 --> 00:16:34,375
I've suffered enough humiliation.

220
00:16:34,875 --> 00:16:36,166
You'll leave for Aligarh tomorrow itself.

221
00:16:36,666 --> 00:16:37,500
Go to your aunt's place. And study there.

222
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,500
Just think, sir. The boy is Hindu.

223
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:41,957
We'll be disgraced in society.

224
00:16:42,457 --> 00:16:44,916
What about your daughter who flirts around with the entire neighbourhood?

225
00:16:45,416 --> 00:16:47,207
How dare you come here to complain about me?

226
00:16:47,707 --> 00:16:48,750
Get lost. - Keep quiet.

227
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:50,750
Keep quiet.

228
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:52,625
Is this the age to be doing all this?

229
00:16:53,125 --> 00:16:55,541
And from where did you learn to misbehave?

230
00:16:56,041 --> 00:16:58,541
You'll be leaving for Aligarh tomorrow itself.

231
00:16:59,041 --> 00:16:59,875
Kundan, your father-in-law's sending..

232
00:17:00,375 --> 00:17:01,791
..your wife away to Aligarh, forcefully.

233
00:17:02,291 --> 00:17:05,375
Hurry up, or you will miss her.

234
00:17:05,875 --> 00:17:07,250
Find another Ram, he's gone for good.

235
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:10,000
Your papa and I love you a lot.

236
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:15,458
But what you've done will not be tolerated.

237
00:17:15,958 --> 00:17:17,333
Study hard, Zoya.

238
00:17:17,833 --> 00:17:19,540
And remember what we said.

239
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:23,540
And don't get down at any station.

240
00:17:34,625 --> 00:17:38,125
Zoya!

241
00:17:42,458 --> 00:17:45,958
Zoya!

242
00:17:55,083 --> 00:17:59,083
Are you blind?

243
00:17:59,583 --> 00:18:02,040
Zoya, don't worry. I'll wait for you. - Stop.

244
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:06,708
You bet. By the time you return everything would've changed.

245
00:18:07,208 --> 00:18:12,833
Waiting for you. Always.

246
00:18:13,333 --> 00:18:17,415
'That day I realised that heart is neither on the left or right.'

247
00:18:17,915 --> 00:18:19,375
'It is in the centre.'

248
00:18:19,875 --> 00:18:21,708
'Because there is where I felt the pain.'

249
00:18:22,208 --> 00:18:23,915
'But I wasn't dead yet.'

250
00:18:24,415 --> 00:18:30,125
'Because this wasn't the end of the story by any means.'

251
00:18:30,625 --> 00:18:33,375
'I was yet to reach my prime.'

252
00:18:33,875 --> 00:18:37,250
Hail Mahadev!

253
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:42,540
No, Kundan.

254
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:46,540
Let papa go.

255
00:18:50,375 --> 00:18:53,165
Kundan! This isn't right.

256
00:18:53,665 --> 00:18:54,500
I'll punish both of you in jail.

257
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,415
I'm ready to go to jail. Just let me colour you once.

258
00:18:56,915 --> 00:18:58,125
Beware, Murari. I'll kill you. - Catch him.

259
00:18:58,625 --> 00:19:02,125
Tear his clothes off.

260
00:19:10,625 --> 00:19:13,665
Kundan, the arms of law are very long.

261
00:19:14,165 --> 00:19:17,125
And so are the legs of criminals.

262
00:19:17,625 --> 00:19:21,125
Careful, papa.

263
00:19:23,790 --> 00:19:27,290
Kundan. - Floor him, Kundan.

264
00:19:33,333 --> 00:19:36,833
Kundan, no.

265
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:43,165
Hail Mahadev!

266
00:19:43,665 --> 00:19:44,958
You're always doing as you want.

267
00:19:45,458 --> 00:19:46,250
Papa was on duty.

268
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:50,290
You think you're funny. I'll show you.

269
00:19:50,790 --> 00:19:54,290
You are a rascal.

270
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:15,000
Will you rip off just my father's clothes?

271
00:20:23,665 --> 00:20:26,915
Kundan is not that easy to get, Bindiya.

272
00:20:27,415 --> 00:20:30,165
If you think you can entice me with your beauty then you are so wrong.

273
00:20:30,665 --> 00:20:35,750
Your competition is returning.

274
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:37,833
Rascal. Darn you and that witch.

275
00:20:38,333 --> 00:20:40,040
Even after 8 years, you're still in love with her, isn't it?

276
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:43,083
Go to hell, Kundan. - Murari.

277
00:20:43,583 --> 00:20:44,165
You are great.

278
00:20:44,665 --> 00:20:46,415
She'll die a torturous death. I swear.

279
00:20:46,915 --> 00:20:49,290
Vultures will feast on her, and you too.

280
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:53,290
What news you've given me!

281
00:20:57,290 --> 00:20:59,665
Come. Come back to your love.

282
00:21:00,165 --> 00:21:06,333
Someone's waiting for you.

283
00:21:06,833 --> 00:21:17,375
My luck will change. My luck will change.

284
00:21:17,875 --> 00:21:21,375
For the better.

285
00:21:37,375 --> 00:21:39,000
There is chaos and music everywhere.

286
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:41,165
You've left to come to me.

287
00:21:41,665 --> 00:21:45,625
Love is in the air. Sweetheart, please show up.

288
00:21:46,125 --> 00:21:49,875
I am madly in love with you.

289
00:21:50,375 --> 00:21:54,125
You are the only one I have.

290
00:21:54,625 --> 00:21:58,415
You light up my life.

291
00:21:58,915 --> 00:22:02,665
You are the only one I have.

292
00:22:03,165 --> 00:22:06,875
You are my world.

293
00:22:07,375 --> 00:22:11,165
You are the only one I have.

294
00:22:11,665 --> 00:22:15,165
You are the only one I have.

295
00:22:41,125 --> 00:22:42,750
My body is grooving. My heart's thumping.

296
00:22:43,250 --> 00:22:44,833
In waiting for you.

297
00:22:45,333 --> 00:22:46,958
The entire world knows what's in my heart.

298
00:22:47,458 --> 00:22:49,415
Only I know what's in your heart.

299
00:22:49,915 --> 00:22:53,583
Let me feel a little more love.

300
00:22:54,083 --> 00:22:57,833
Show me a little more love.

301
00:22:58,333 --> 00:23:02,125
I'm madly in love with you.

302
00:23:02,625 --> 00:23:06,415
You are the only one I have.

303
00:23:06,915 --> 00:23:10,415
You are the only one I have.

304
00:23:23,540 --> 00:23:27,375
I see vibrancy all around. Everything seems to have come to life.

305
00:23:27,875 --> 00:23:31,625
I'm so proud of myself. I have lost control.

306
00:23:32,125 --> 00:23:35,833
I see vibrancy all around. Everything seems to have come to life.

307
00:23:36,333 --> 00:23:40,083
I'm so proud of myself. I have lost control.

308
00:23:40,583 --> 00:23:44,333
Come and whisk me away.

309
00:23:44,833 --> 00:23:48,540
Come and take me away with a smile.

310
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:50,708
There is chaos and music everywhere.

311
00:23:51,208 --> 00:23:52,833
You've left to come to me.

312
00:23:53,333 --> 00:24:00,458
Love is in the air. Sweetheart, please show up.

313
00:24:00,958 --> 00:24:02,665
Seems like sir's car has broken down.

314
00:24:03,165 --> 00:24:03,833
To hell with the sir.

315
00:24:04,333 --> 00:24:05,040
Are you going to meet her in front of him?

316
00:24:05,540 --> 00:24:06,290
Hold the wrench. - Yes.

317
00:24:06,790 --> 00:24:07,458
Lord Shiva is on our side.

318
00:24:07,958 --> 00:24:10,250
Not just Lord Shiva. Even the spark plug of the sir's car..

319
00:24:10,750 --> 00:24:11,750
..is on our side.

320
00:24:12,250 --> 00:24:17,040
Murari, you are genius.

321
00:24:17,540 --> 00:24:21,040
Run, quickly. I'll handle here.

322
00:24:31,415 --> 00:24:32,540
Is there a problem? - No.

323
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:34,915
Don't be so unfair. Let's carry one bag at least.

324
00:24:35,415 --> 00:24:36,458
We talked to him for two hours.

325
00:24:36,958 --> 00:24:37,833
Let him do work worth 200 bucks at least.

326
00:24:38,333 --> 00:24:41,833
Shall I give him the books as well? - Sure. Go ahead.

327
00:25:20,208 --> 00:25:22,458
What? She just didn't recognise you?

328
00:25:22,958 --> 00:25:26,790
Right. She just passed by.

329
00:25:27,290 --> 00:25:30,165
But Murari, she is really beautiful.

330
00:25:30,665 --> 00:25:34,165
Even Katrina Kaif pales in comparison to her.

331
00:25:34,665 --> 00:25:36,458
Yes, she is your Katrina Kaif.

332
00:25:36,958 --> 00:25:43,415
And both, she and Katrina don't recognise you.

333
00:25:43,915 --> 00:25:45,625
How is it going, Kundan? - Hello, aunty.

334
00:25:46,125 --> 00:25:47,875
But Kundan, we haven't run out of gas yet?

335
00:25:48,375 --> 00:25:49,750
Aunty, it's the festive season. - Yes.

336
00:25:50,250 --> 00:25:51,833
You will not get it later. - That's right.

337
00:25:52,333 --> 00:25:55,040
Come. Keep it here.

338
00:25:55,540 --> 00:25:58,790
Okay, Kundan. Look, the sink pipe has started leaking again.

339
00:25:59,290 --> 00:26:00,040
Please change it.

340
00:26:00,540 --> 00:26:05,083
Okay. I'll check.

341
00:26:05,583 --> 00:26:07,458
And the servicing of the Fiat was not up to the mark.

342
00:26:07,958 --> 00:26:09,333
We had to go pick up Zoya this morning.

343
00:26:09,833 --> 00:26:11,583
And it just wouldn't start.

344
00:26:12,083 --> 00:26:15,583
I need to check the spark plug. - Yes.

345
00:26:39,333 --> 00:26:43,125
So brother...did she recognise you?

346
00:26:43,625 --> 00:26:47,125
Did she recognise you?

347
00:26:49,165 --> 00:26:52,083
It means that this girl has lost her memory.

348
00:26:52,583 --> 00:26:53,375
Take her to some doctor.

349
00:26:53,875 --> 00:26:55,708
She will refuse to come. But still, take her to a doctor.

350
00:26:56,208 --> 00:26:58,000
Come on. Get lost. Go.

351
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:02,000
Okay. All hail Lord Shiva.

352
00:28:11,665 --> 00:28:15,083
How are you?

353
00:28:15,583 --> 00:28:16,290
I am good now.

354
00:28:16,790 --> 00:28:18,583
That is what I was wondering. What's wrong with Banaras?

355
00:28:19,083 --> 00:28:20,875
Even the delivery guys are flirting with girls.

356
00:28:21,375 --> 00:28:25,165
I felt that I have seen you somewhere.

357
00:28:25,665 --> 00:28:27,790
How is the wrist?

358
00:28:28,290 --> 00:28:31,125
This one.

359
00:28:31,625 --> 00:28:33,415
Okay. See you. - When?

360
00:28:33,915 --> 00:28:37,415
Soon. Bye.

361
00:28:57,500 --> 00:29:00,415
From a small school to JNU.

362
00:29:00,915 --> 00:29:01,665
How did you get there?

363
00:29:02,165 --> 00:29:06,540
Have you stopped eating Gol Gappas(snacks)?

364
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:07,833
This is my friend. Rashmi.

365
00:29:08,333 --> 00:29:09,500
Rashmi, this is...

366
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,540
Myself Shankar. Kundan Shankar.

367
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:16,540
Are the Gol Gappas good? - They are excellent.

368
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:22,915
Zoya, how are we going to go? - Where?

369
00:29:23,415 --> 00:29:26,290
We have to elope, right?

370
00:29:26,790 --> 00:29:28,540
Why are we going to elope?

371
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:32,250
Okay. So I'll convert into a Muslim.

372
00:29:32,750 --> 00:29:34,375
Why would you convert into a Muslim?

373
00:29:34,875 --> 00:29:37,665
Then how will we get married?

374
00:29:38,165 --> 00:29:38,833
Whose marriage?

375
00:29:39,333 --> 00:29:40,290
Yours and mine.

376
00:29:40,790 --> 00:29:41,540
Hold on, brother.

377
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:44,125
Why would I and you get married?

378
00:29:44,625 --> 00:29:49,290
Because we love each other. - Since when?

379
00:29:49,790 --> 00:29:51,458
Are five done? - There is one left.

380
00:29:51,958 --> 00:29:54,415
So give. And some more for madam.

381
00:29:54,915 --> 00:29:59,250
One minute.

382
00:29:59,750 --> 00:30:02,540
What were you saying? - Talk decently.

383
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:06,375
Okay. Let's make this a little decent.

384
00:30:06,875 --> 00:30:07,875
When did we fall in love?

385
00:30:08,375 --> 00:30:09,290
Give this to me.

386
00:30:09,790 --> 00:30:10,375
What do you mean when did we fall in love?

387
00:30:10,875 --> 00:30:11,875
We have been in love since the last 8 years.

388
00:30:12,375 --> 00:30:14,000
In your dreams, Kundan. There is nothing of that sort.

389
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:15,540
I was in the 9th grade back then.

390
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:18,415
Yes. As if I was pursuing law.

391
00:30:18,915 --> 00:30:20,583
I was also in the 10th grade.

392
00:30:21,083 --> 00:30:23,665
Kundan, we were immature then.

393
00:30:24,165 --> 00:30:26,290
So now we are mature. Do it now.

394
00:30:26,790 --> 00:30:28,750
You're mad, Kundan. There is nothing of that sort.

395
00:30:29,250 --> 00:30:31,250
Rashmi, let's go. Come on.

396
00:30:31,750 --> 00:30:32,540
Who is he?

397
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:36,875
He was my friend when I was small. He is mad.

398
00:30:37,375 --> 00:30:39,415
Listen you rickshaw driver, don't take money from madam.

399
00:30:39,915 --> 00:30:40,540
She is your sister-in-law.

400
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:41,750
Which one, brother?

401
00:30:42,250 --> 00:30:44,540
The tall one who is angry.

402
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:47,125
What are you looking at? Look in front.

403
00:30:47,625 --> 00:30:48,833
You're mad. There is nothing of that sort.

404
00:30:49,333 --> 00:30:52,040
Forget me. - You forget me.

405
00:30:52,540 --> 00:30:55,875
Forget me means goodbye.

406
00:30:56,375 --> 00:30:59,875
The 10 year investment has gone down the drain.

407
00:31:04,290 --> 00:31:06,415
Murari, I have come at the right time.

408
00:31:06,915 --> 00:31:07,790
Here's some sweet.

409
00:31:08,290 --> 00:31:09,875
I heard that the priest's son has become a widower.

410
00:31:10,375 --> 00:31:12,665
Oh Lord!

411
00:31:13,165 --> 00:31:14,250
What are you going to do now, mister?

412
00:31:14,750 --> 00:31:15,790
Your sweetheart has lost her memory.

413
00:31:16,290 --> 00:31:17,583
Hide.

414
00:31:18,083 --> 00:31:21,958
Murari, shut her up. Or I'll beat her up.

415
00:31:22,458 --> 00:31:23,833
Bindiya, stop deriving pleasure from this.

416
00:31:24,333 --> 00:31:26,750
The boy is serious.

417
00:31:27,250 --> 00:31:28,750
Kundan, your Lord cannot be such a liar.

418
00:31:29,250 --> 00:31:30,458
I have been fasting on Mondays for the last 15 years.

419
00:31:30,958 --> 00:31:31,833
You are not marrying Zoya.

420
00:31:32,333 --> 00:31:33,540
Do you want a beating?

421
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:35,375
I had told you. I had told you. You'll get beaten up.

422
00:31:35,875 --> 00:31:36,790
Okay. Okay. Leave her.

423
00:31:37,290 --> 00:31:39,583
Don't push her down and hit her on the back.

424
00:31:40,083 --> 00:31:40,790
Don't throw her out.

425
00:31:41,290 --> 00:31:42,415
Don't throw her out the house. - Rascal!

426
00:31:42,915 --> 00:31:43,625
Threw her out of the house.

427
00:31:44,125 --> 00:31:45,333
You moron! I curse you.

428
00:31:45,833 --> 00:31:46,708
What happened, Bindiya?

429
00:31:47,208 --> 00:31:49,165
Aunty, he is drunk in the afternoon. That dog.

430
00:31:49,665 --> 00:31:52,165
Banaras will rejoice the day you marry me, Kundan.

431
00:31:52,665 --> 00:31:55,290
I would rather marry a witch than marry you.

432
00:31:55,790 --> 00:31:56,958
Why you..

433
00:31:57,458 --> 00:32:00,958
You are the witch. - Yes. Break the sandal as well.

434
00:32:09,375 --> 00:32:10,415
Kundan. - Shut up.

435
00:32:10,915 --> 00:32:12,165
You monkey. - You're the monkey.

436
00:32:12,665 --> 00:32:14,415
Since you have a tail.

437
00:32:14,915 --> 00:32:17,000
Zoya. - Oh no. - Curses.

438
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:19,083
It's stuck.

439
00:32:19,583 --> 00:32:21,165
Kundan, thank God I found you. - Tell me.

440
00:32:21,665 --> 00:32:23,790
I was looking for you in the university as well.

441
00:32:24,290 --> 00:32:25,750
We have a small function at home tomorrow.

442
00:32:26,250 --> 00:32:27,708
We are expecting around 50-60 guests.

443
00:32:28,208 --> 00:32:29,833
Well, I have told Sunder to do the decoration.

444
00:32:30,333 --> 00:32:32,540
You also get some of your boys to work on it.

445
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:34,040
Will come handy.

446
00:32:34,540 --> 00:32:36,083
What's happening tomorrow night?

447
00:32:36,583 --> 00:32:37,375
What's happening tomorrow night?

448
00:32:37,875 --> 00:32:40,040
Nothing as such. You have come after so long.

449
00:32:40,540 --> 00:32:42,875
And nothing has happened in the house all this while.

450
00:32:43,375 --> 00:32:44,790
Great. - Not bad.

451
00:32:45,290 --> 00:32:47,500
Kundan, what are you doing here?

452
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:53,790
Well... - He has come to wear bangles.

453
00:32:54,290 --> 00:32:58,083
Listen. Why does she laugh when she sees you?

454
00:32:58,583 --> 00:32:59,833
Because she feels shy.

455
00:33:00,333 --> 00:33:03,415
Now would she stare her eyes out at her future husband?

456
00:33:03,915 --> 00:33:05,833
A little shyness. A little shame.

457
00:33:06,333 --> 00:33:07,750
This is the mark of a woman, Murari.

458
00:33:08,250 --> 00:33:12,040
No. I think you'll have a slit wrist again.

459
00:33:12,540 --> 00:33:16,458
Darn you.

460
00:33:16,958 --> 00:33:17,958
Get lost.

461
00:33:18,458 --> 00:33:20,583
Everyone's looking so decent.

462
00:33:21,083 --> 00:33:24,915
Pal, where is your madam?

463
00:33:25,415 --> 00:33:29,290
And nor is her intelligent friend to be seen.

464
00:33:29,790 --> 00:33:33,125
No problem. Both of them must be having a bath.

465
00:33:33,625 --> 00:33:33,875
Shut up.

466
00:33:34,375 --> 00:33:36,790
So Kundan. Is everything under control?

467
00:33:37,290 --> 00:33:39,040
Yes, uncle. - Handle everything.

468
00:33:39,540 --> 00:33:40,583
A match is coming to see Zoya.

469
00:33:41,083 --> 00:33:41,708
He is a doctor.

470
00:33:42,208 --> 00:33:43,540
We'll get her married to him if he likes her.

471
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:46,375
I will also be retiring in two years.

472
00:33:46,875 --> 00:33:47,915
Where is Zoya?

473
00:33:48,415 --> 00:33:51,915
What did father-in-law say?

474
00:34:04,958 --> 00:34:07,000
Stop.

475
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:08,750
You are fooling me?

476
00:34:09,250 --> 00:34:10,333
What nonsense, Kundan.

477
00:34:10,833 --> 00:34:11,583
Let go of my hand. It hurts.

478
00:34:12,083 --> 00:34:15,416
I am also hurting. I have slit my wrist once.

479
00:34:15,916 --> 00:34:17,291
Mind you, this time I'll slit yours.

480
00:34:17,791 --> 00:34:18,583
What's wrong, Kundan?

481
00:34:19,083 --> 00:34:21,750
Why are you acting crazy? - Okay.

482
00:34:22,250 --> 00:34:25,291
Don't you know that a boy is coming to see you this evening?

483
00:34:25,791 --> 00:34:29,291
That is why your father is having this celebration.

484
00:34:35,750 --> 00:34:37,500
Mummy, is some boy coming to see me this evening.

485
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,125
Yes. - Why didn't you tell me?

486
00:34:39,625 --> 00:34:40,458
What should I have told you?

487
00:34:40,958 --> 00:34:42,000
Your father has fixed everything.

488
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:44,041
Mummy, I am not a kid anymore that you can do as you please.

489
00:34:44,541 --> 00:34:45,416
I don't want to marry.

490
00:34:45,916 --> 00:34:48,250
Zoya, don't create a scene.

491
00:34:48,750 --> 00:34:51,041
Meet the boy and then let's see.

492
00:34:51,541 --> 00:34:54,250
Look, he is only coming to see you.

493
00:34:54,750 --> 00:34:55,916
You're not getting married in the evening.

494
00:34:56,416 --> 00:34:59,541
I have lots on my plate. Let me go.

495
00:35:00,041 --> 00:35:06,666
Listen. - Sister-in-law. Zoya. Ms. Zoya.

496
00:35:07,166 --> 00:35:09,458
Kundan will attend the evening's party, right?

497
00:35:09,958 --> 00:35:10,708
How can he not come?

498
00:35:11,208 --> 00:35:14,708
The guru has given him the job of serving sherbets.

499
00:35:19,958 --> 00:35:21,541
Here, take all of it.

500
00:35:22,041 --> 00:35:24,041
When will you people stop acting silly?

501
00:35:24,541 --> 00:35:28,041
Drink one at least first. Keep it. Go.

502
00:35:32,958 --> 00:35:39,500
Kundan, Zoya is calling you. - Why?

503
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:43,500
Why don't you ask her?

504
00:35:53,125 --> 00:35:56,625
I didn't know of all this, Kundan.

505
00:36:04,916 --> 00:36:08,416
I don't want to marry that boy.

506
00:36:10,750 --> 00:36:13,541
I see. So then?

507
00:36:14,041 --> 00:36:15,125
Save me from all of this, Kundan?

508
00:36:15,625 --> 00:36:17,666
Otherwise I'll slit my wrist before you do.

509
00:36:18,166 --> 00:36:22,750
Don't say so, Zoya. Wait and watch.

510
00:36:23,250 --> 00:36:24,791
Move. - These days you are rarely seen.

511
00:36:25,291 --> 00:36:27,541
My marriage has been fixed. - Here.

512
00:36:28,041 --> 00:36:29,291
What a shame. - Get lost.

513
00:36:29,791 --> 00:36:31,750
Aren't you ashamed to be a waiter?

514
00:36:32,250 --> 00:36:33,375
Why should I be ashamed?

515
00:36:33,875 --> 00:36:35,583
Your prince Charles is himself serving sherbet to these rascals.

516
00:36:36,083 --> 00:36:37,458
Oh God! Why?

517
00:36:37,958 --> 00:36:39,000
What do you mean why? It's sister-in-law's party.

518
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:42,541
She is your sister-in-law. And me?

519
00:36:43,041 --> 00:36:44,458
You are also sister-in-law.

520
00:36:44,958 --> 00:36:47,041
And her? - She's sister-in-law too.

521
00:36:47,541 --> 00:36:49,708
As if your Kundan is a superstar..

522
00:36:50,208 --> 00:36:52,708
..that every girl would marry him.

523
00:36:53,208 --> 00:36:56,708
Isn't he? Turn around.

524
00:37:26,333 --> 00:37:30,875
Someone's come before me. And my heart's pounding.

525
00:37:31,375 --> 00:37:35,708
Just a glimpse of hers has driven me crazy.

526
00:37:36,208 --> 00:37:40,500
Someone's come before me. And my heart's pounding.

527
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:45,000
Just a glimpse of hers has driven me crazy.

528
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:49,708
She will chat and meet me also.

529
00:37:50,208 --> 00:37:54,791
She'll be friends with me sooner or later.

530
00:37:55,291 --> 00:37:59,541
Someone's come before me. And my heart's pounding.

531
00:38:00,041 --> 00:38:03,541
Just a glimpse of hers has driven me crazy.

532
00:38:09,458 --> 00:38:15,166
Ordinary boys of lose their love to a doctor or a engineer.

533
00:38:15,666 --> 00:38:18,500
Don't be disheartened.

534
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:22,500
Murari, this is Banaras.

535
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:26,583
And if the ordinary boy loses here as well, then he'll never win.

536
00:38:27,083 --> 00:38:27,875
Is that so?

537
00:38:28,375 --> 00:38:31,875
Mother. Please tell me. Zoya will die, right?

538
00:38:38,041 --> 00:38:41,875
Kundan will marry me, right?

539
00:38:42,375 --> 00:38:45,875
Bindiya.

540
00:38:48,750 --> 00:38:50,791
I will not do anything for you. Spare me.

541
00:38:51,291 --> 00:38:52,791
Listen, Bindiya. - No!

542
00:38:53,291 --> 00:38:55,250
You act so sweet when you need a favour.

543
00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:56,708
Otherwise you keep abusing me.

544
00:38:57,208 --> 00:38:59,250
You're getting mad for no reason.

545
00:38:59,750 --> 00:39:01,875
Aren't you my friend?

546
00:39:02,375 --> 00:39:04,333
Wait. Let me see. Hold on.

547
00:39:04,833 --> 00:39:07,541
Mother, she should do things for us, right?

548
00:39:08,041 --> 00:39:09,416
Look, she's saying yes. -See. - What do you want from me?

549
00:39:09,916 --> 00:39:13,416
Come here. - Tell her the idea.

550
00:39:16,375 --> 00:39:18,500
Yuck. Gross. Not at all.

551
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,333
Bindiya, try to understand.

552
00:39:21,833 --> 00:39:23,083
I'm not doing anything for that wretch. - Murari!

553
00:39:23,583 --> 00:39:27,083
Not at all. - Murari, come on.

554
00:39:30,875 --> 00:39:34,375
Catch her. - I'll never do it.

555
00:39:47,416 --> 00:39:54,750
Banarasi guy. Banarasi guy.

556
00:39:55,250 --> 00:39:57,375
Banarasi guy.

557
00:39:57,875 --> 00:40:00,125
Banarasi guy.

558
00:40:00,625 --> 00:40:02,666
Is there is a mess up or are things messed up?

559
00:40:03,166 --> 00:40:08,000
Banarasi guy. Banarasi guy.

560
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:10,708
Are we fighting together? Or are we fighting because we are together.

561
00:40:11,208 --> 00:40:18,375
Banarasi guy. Banarasi guy.

562
00:40:18,875 --> 00:40:26,375
Banarasi guy. Banarasi guy.

563
00:40:26,875 --> 00:40:29,458
Banarasi guy.

564
00:40:29,958 --> 00:40:37,291
Trickery is in the blood of every man and woman here.

565
00:40:37,791 --> 00:40:45,041
Trickery is in the blood of every man and woman here.

566
00:40:45,541 --> 00:40:50,250
But they are innocent at heart.

567
00:40:50,750 --> 00:40:55,166
They spend their lives at the banks of Ganga.

568
00:40:55,666 --> 00:40:58,125
Residents of the bank.

569
00:40:58,625 --> 00:41:02,458
Residents of the bank.

570
00:41:02,958 --> 00:41:08,333
But Banarasi people have an attitude all their own.

571
00:41:08,833 --> 00:41:14,041
But Banarasi people have an attitude all their own.

572
00:41:14,541 --> 00:41:18,041
But Banarasi people have an attitude all their own.

573
00:41:48,833 --> 00:41:53,500
Is there is a mess up or are things messed up.

574
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:58,916
Are we fighting together? Or are we fighting because we are together.

575
00:41:59,416 --> 00:42:06,791
They are capable of anything when it comes to them.

576
00:42:07,291 --> 00:42:14,666
They are capable of anything when it comes to them.

577
00:42:15,166 --> 00:42:20,000
They chomp on some betel nut leaf..

578
00:42:20,500 --> 00:42:24,875
..and walk around proudly.

579
00:42:25,375 --> 00:42:27,916
Proud Banarasi.

580
00:42:28,416 --> 00:42:30,875
Proud Banarasi.

581
00:42:31,375 --> 00:42:32,500
No. This is not possible.

582
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,000
I...I mean we're over and done with this.

583
00:42:35,500 --> 00:42:37,750
That's it. Okay. Yes.

584
00:42:38,250 --> 00:42:40,250
Proud Banarasi.

585
00:42:40,750 --> 00:42:43,083
Proud Banarasi.

586
00:42:43,583 --> 00:42:46,333
Proud Banarasi.

587
00:42:46,833 --> 00:42:49,000
Proud Banarasi.

588
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:51,583
Proud Banarasi.

589
00:42:52,083 --> 00:42:59,500
Is there is a mess up or are things messed up?

590
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:07,291
Are we fighting together? Or are we fighting because we are together.

591
00:43:07,791 --> 00:43:12,541
Banarasi guy. Banarasi guy.

592
00:43:13,041 --> 00:43:16,541
Banarasi guy. Banarasi guy.

593
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:24,500
Great. Now that you don't need me anymore..

594
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:26,666
..you even don't recognise me.

595
00:43:27,166 --> 00:43:28,500
I do. Of course.

596
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:30,541
Since I got you of this pickle, won't I get a reward?

597
00:43:31,041 --> 00:43:34,291
Absolutely. Tell me. What do you want?

598
00:43:34,791 --> 00:43:38,166
Marry me, Zoya.

599
00:43:38,666 --> 00:43:42,625
Are you mad? No. Never.

600
00:43:43,125 --> 00:43:45,666
Okay. Look, I bought this scooter for you.

601
00:43:46,166 --> 00:43:47,166
But you never sat on it.

602
00:43:47,666 --> 00:43:49,083
You'll have to be my pillion.

603
00:43:49,583 --> 00:43:50,500
You will have to hold me by my waist.

604
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:51,708
Not the stepney.

605
00:43:52,208 --> 00:43:54,291
When I put on the breaks, you'll have to fall on me.

606
00:43:54,791 --> 00:43:55,916
You will have to laugh at things I say.

607
00:43:56,416 --> 00:43:58,458
You will have to sing with me.

608
00:43:58,958 --> 00:44:00,125
You can do this at least, right?

609
00:44:00,625 --> 00:44:04,125
At least let me feel it. So be it if not as my girlfriend.

610
00:44:43,833 --> 00:44:45,666
That day for the first time I saw you so upset.

611
00:44:46,166 --> 00:44:47,000
I was so scared.

612
00:44:47,500 --> 00:44:48,708
Yes, I stepped over the line.

613
00:44:49,208 --> 00:44:52,333
Okay, I swear. I'll never ever get mad at you again.

614
00:44:52,833 --> 00:44:55,416
Okay. I have something to say.

615
00:44:55,916 --> 00:44:57,125
Go ahead.

616
00:44:57,625 --> 00:45:00,208
Thank you. You saved my life.

617
00:45:00,708 --> 00:45:01,750
I would've been dead otherwise.

618
00:45:02,250 --> 00:45:03,375
Me too.

619
00:45:03,875 --> 00:45:07,333
Come what may. I would've never married that boy.

620
00:45:07,833 --> 00:45:10,375
I love someone else.

621
00:45:10,875 --> 00:45:13,500
I know. But you've never said it.

622
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,333
I am telling now. There is a boy.

623
00:45:16,833 --> 00:45:18,916
He studies with me in Delhi JNU.

624
00:45:19,416 --> 00:45:22,458
I'll give up my life if I don't marry him.

625
00:45:22,958 --> 00:45:25,958
I love him a lot.

626
00:45:26,458 --> 00:45:29,875
'Three years in Aligarh had left me really weak, Kundan.'

627
00:45:30,375 --> 00:45:32,500
'My confidence was at an all time low.'

628
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,500
'Leave the house meekly. And come back meekly.'

629
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:39,125
'Every girl was trained to be the ideal wife.'

630
00:45:39,625 --> 00:45:42,083
'Aunt was running a coaching institute and not a house.'

631
00:45:42,583 --> 00:45:44,375
'I was good at studies. So teachers told..'

632
00:45:44,875 --> 00:45:46,750
'..me that I should study in Delhi.'

633
00:45:47,250 --> 00:45:47,625
Vote for Aisha. Vote for Aisha.

634
00:45:48,125 --> 00:45:48,708
'So, after a lot of struggle..'

635
00:45:49,208 --> 00:45:50,333
'..I came to JNU, after completing my 12th.'

636
00:45:50,833 --> 00:45:51,958
'I had to repeat 9th again..'

637
00:45:52,458 --> 00:45:54,625
'..due to which, there was a gap year.'

638
00:45:55,125 --> 00:45:56,583
'I was having trouble getting admission.'

639
00:45:57,083 --> 00:45:59,500
'I had adequate marks, but couldn't get admission.'

640
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:01,125
'When I arrived at JNU, it was election time.'

641
00:46:01,625 --> 00:46:02,291
Parveen, go from here. Wait there.

642
00:46:02,791 --> 00:46:04,458
I wish to see Mr. Anand. - I had asked you to do that.

643
00:46:04,958 --> 00:46:05,375
Yes.

644
00:46:05,875 --> 00:46:07,416
Look, my marks are up to the mark. But I am not getting admission.

645
00:46:07,916 --> 00:46:09,583
Why? - Because I took a year's break.

646
00:46:10,083 --> 00:46:12,375
Do this. Be there outside VC's office tomorrow at 11.

647
00:46:12,875 --> 00:46:13,666
Tomorrow at 11. - Okay. Please.

648
00:46:14,166 --> 00:46:17,666
Did you call him or not?

649
00:46:21,500 --> 00:46:23,333
'That day I saw him for the first time.'

650
00:46:23,833 --> 00:46:27,333
'An ordinary guy in a pant and shirt.'

651
00:46:27,833 --> 00:46:30,708
'He had innocence in his eyes. But he was fearless.'

652
00:46:31,208 --> 00:46:32,958
'He came across like a born leader.'

653
00:46:33,458 --> 00:46:35,000
'When I saw him I felt something which..'

654
00:46:35,500 --> 00:46:37,708
'..I had never felt in 21-22 years.'

655
00:46:38,208 --> 00:46:40,750
'During the conversation, he lost his cool a number of times.'

656
00:46:41,250 --> 00:46:43,416
'He banged on the table. Threw things around.'

657
00:46:43,916 --> 00:46:45,416
'But he never raised his voice. Nor did he threaten.'

658
00:46:45,916 --> 00:46:47,166
'And nor was he disrespectful.' - I'm talking to you.

659
00:46:47,666 --> 00:46:49,500
'And the VC had to relent.' - Calm down.

660
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:50,916
'And they got up, and left just quietly.'

661
00:46:51,416 --> 00:46:52,750
He wasn't as tough as he looked.

662
00:46:53,250 --> 00:46:55,083
He readily agreed to all our demands.

663
00:46:55,583 --> 00:46:56,583
Excuse me. - Listen, come here.

664
00:46:57,083 --> 00:46:59,250
Thank you. - Aunty, that's great.

665
00:46:59,750 --> 00:47:03,958
Could've said that with a smile.

666
00:47:04,458 --> 00:47:06,000
'That was my first meeting with him.'

667
00:47:06,500 --> 00:47:08,166
'After that, I saw on the day of the election results.'

668
00:47:08,666 --> 00:47:11,500
Catch. Stop there.

669
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:13,208
I said stop.

670
00:47:13,708 --> 00:47:14,541
Catch him.

671
00:47:15,041 --> 00:47:20,833
Catch him from that side.

672
00:47:21,333 --> 00:47:26,000
Hi!

673
00:47:26,500 --> 00:47:28,708
We won!

674
00:47:29,208 --> 00:47:32,000
We won!

675
00:47:32,500 --> 00:47:34,583
We won!

676
00:47:35,083 --> 00:47:36,791
So, we can stop running now.

677
00:47:37,291 --> 00:47:39,000
Uncle, 3 cups of tea.

678
00:47:39,500 --> 00:47:42,416
You can drink with the President today.

679
00:47:42,916 --> 00:47:43,958
Enjoy.

680
00:47:44,458 --> 00:47:46,958
Consider that, a farmer has four children.

681
00:47:47,458 --> 00:47:49,583
And, there's a bowl of porridge prepared in his home.

682
00:47:50,083 --> 00:47:54,416
But, I say why not make two bowls of porridge?

683
00:47:54,916 --> 00:47:59,500
They'll say We've material enough for just one.

684
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:03,166
I believe, the rest of it is at the minister's home.

685
00:48:03,666 --> 00:48:04,750
There's one thing I would like to say.

686
00:48:05,250 --> 00:48:07,958
When the poor won't have anything to eat..

687
00:48:08,458 --> 00:48:11,958
..they'll start eating the rich.

688
00:48:20,416 --> 00:48:23,125
War. War. American war.

689
00:48:23,625 --> 00:48:26,500
American war.

690
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:28,708
America...

691
00:48:29,208 --> 00:48:30,625
All of you sing really well.

692
00:48:31,125 --> 00:48:33,500
You should quit social work and start a band.

693
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:35,458
And madam, you're so beautiful that you should..

694
00:48:35,958 --> 00:48:37,958
..quit college and become an actress.

695
00:48:38,458 --> 00:48:39,500
No. Don't say that.

696
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:41,291
Ever since this girl has come to the university..

697
00:48:41,791 --> 00:48:42,958
..it seems more likeable, right?

698
00:48:43,458 --> 00:48:46,541
You are right.

699
00:48:47,041 --> 00:48:52,875
Escapism is the easiest thing in this world.

700
00:48:53,375 --> 00:48:58,416
I am dying to see Disneyland and statue of liberty.

701
00:48:58,916 --> 00:49:04,166
Choose between Coca Cola and Pepsi.

702
00:49:04,666 --> 00:49:06,750
I heard your speech at the seminar.

703
00:49:07,250 --> 00:49:10,500
Do you actually think that everyone in this world is equal?

704
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:13,333
I mean in a country like India can you seriously overlook caste..

705
00:49:13,833 --> 00:49:16,333
..culture, creed, community, social and economic position..

706
00:49:16,833 --> 00:49:18,375
..of every individual and speak about equality.

707
00:49:18,875 --> 00:49:20,458
But I seriously think you are over-romanticizing a situation..

708
00:49:20,958 --> 00:49:24,458
..which needs a much more logical approach.

709
00:49:27,375 --> 00:49:30,375
What is your name? - Zoya.

710
00:49:30,875 --> 00:49:34,375
Zoya.

711
00:49:37,250 --> 00:49:42,958
Even If I was a nobody, you would still be wincing like this.

712
00:49:43,458 --> 00:49:45,250
Every man in this country is different.

713
00:49:45,750 --> 00:49:52,166
On caste, creed, class....blah...blah...

714
00:49:52,666 --> 00:49:54,166
This is the fact.

715
00:49:54,666 --> 00:49:57,875
And I don't fight for facts, madam.

716
00:49:58,375 --> 00:50:01,000
I fight for what's right.

717
00:50:01,500 --> 00:50:05,083
Sorry. - Go to hell.

718
00:50:05,583 --> 00:50:07,458
'This was happening to me for the first time, Kundan.'

719
00:50:07,958 --> 00:50:10,041
'Right from Banaras to Aligarh to Delhi..'

720
00:50:10,541 --> 00:50:13,333
'..this was the first man who had treated me like that.'

721
00:50:13,833 --> 00:50:17,416
'For him, I was like anyone else.'

722
00:50:17,916 --> 00:50:21,416
'Actually he proved what he said.'

723
00:50:54,291 --> 00:50:56,500
I get scared in the examination hall. - What else can happen?

724
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:58,583
How were the exams?

725
00:50:59,083 --> 00:51:01,250
Madam, I had apologized to you.

726
00:51:01,750 --> 00:51:03,958
What will you get by failing me?

727
00:51:04,458 --> 00:51:07,916
Equality. You had chits to cheat.

728
00:51:08,416 --> 00:51:09,458
The rest didn't.

729
00:51:09,958 --> 00:51:11,041
Either come prepared next time..

730
00:51:11,541 --> 00:51:13,625
..or distribute the chits in the entire examination hall.

731
00:51:14,125 --> 00:51:17,541
This is a fact and also justified.

732
00:51:18,041 --> 00:51:24,625
Now have I proved my point? - No.

733
00:51:25,125 --> 00:51:27,125
I haven't kissed anybody else in this college.

734
00:51:27,625 --> 00:51:29,333
This proves that you are privileged.

735
00:51:29,833 --> 00:51:36,500
This proves that not everyone in this world is equal.

736
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:39,958
It was like I had regained my lost courage, Kundan.

737
00:51:40,458 --> 00:51:42,291
This was college. A new world.

738
00:51:42,791 --> 00:51:44,625
New people. New courage.

739
00:51:45,125 --> 00:51:45,625
And, new love!

740
00:51:46,125 --> 00:51:51,041
I'm only for you, I'm your world.

741
00:51:51,541 --> 00:51:56,000
You're so sweet, while I'm bitter.

742
00:51:56,500 --> 00:52:00,000
I'm all yours, I'm your world.

743
00:52:07,375 --> 00:52:12,333
The color red's so pure.

744
00:52:18,291 --> 00:52:20,791
It's pure, it's filled with life.' 	3132833	3137791	5375

745
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
in my heart now.

746
00:52:21,291 --> 00:52:23,791
I've found my beloved.

747
00:52:24,291 --> 00:52:29,250
Let no one cast an evil eye on you.

748
00:52:29,750 --> 00:52:34,833
Curses to anyone who does.

749
00:52:35,333 --> 00:52:39,541
My heart now belongs to you.

750
00:52:40,041 --> 00:52:44,958
Let no one cast an evil eye on you.

751
00:52:45,458 --> 00:52:53,750
Let no one cast an evil eye on you.

752
00:52:54,250 --> 00:52:59,208
I'm only for you, I'm your world.

753
00:52:59,708 --> 00:53:04,083
You're so sweet, while I'm bitter.

754
00:53:04,583 --> 00:53:07,666
I'm all yours, I'm your world.

755
00:53:08,166 --> 00:53:11,666
I'm all yours.

756
00:53:22,208 --> 00:53:26,583
Kundan!

757
00:53:27,083 --> 00:53:30,583
What are you doing, Kundan?

758
00:53:41,250 --> 00:53:44,750
Kundan. Kundan.

759
00:54:00,333 --> 00:54:02,000
There will be no electricity for three days.

760
00:54:02,500 --> 00:54:03,791
Yeah, that's common with us too.

761
00:54:04,291 --> 00:54:07,291
What happened? How did you get wet?

762
00:54:07,791 --> 00:54:09,041
Did someone throw water on you?

763
00:54:09,541 --> 00:54:12,916
There's a boy here to see you. Go inside and change.

764
00:54:13,416 --> 00:54:18,125
I'm serving food, get changed.

765
00:54:18,625 --> 00:54:22,250
You just sat down.

766
00:54:22,750 --> 00:54:24,250
Get married. That's all we want.

767
00:54:24,750 --> 00:54:27,583
I don't want to. - What do you mean you don't want to?

768
00:54:28,083 --> 00:54:29,666
He was such a nice, well educated boy.

769
00:54:30,166 --> 00:54:33,041
Well educated? They are freaking half educated people.

770
00:54:33,541 --> 00:54:35,666
What did you say? - What do you want, mother?

771
00:54:36,166 --> 00:54:37,291
Either you shouldn't have sent me out of town..

772
00:54:37,791 --> 00:54:38,541
..or given me such good education.

773
00:54:39,041 --> 00:54:40,166
And since you have done so much..

774
00:54:40,666 --> 00:54:41,875
..the boy should be of my choice, right?

775
00:54:42,375 --> 00:54:45,875
Or should I marry an uncouth boy like Kundan?

776
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:55,333
This boy...was like Kundan?

777
00:54:55,833 --> 00:54:56,583
He has a big house. Big cars.

778
00:54:57,083 --> 00:55:00,583
What else does one need?

779
00:55:03,291 --> 00:55:05,250
I want a boy like me.

780
00:55:05,750 --> 00:55:08,916
What do you mean by that?

781
00:55:09,416 --> 00:55:12,916
I love someone else. - What?

782
00:55:25,041 --> 00:55:27,541
You call this cleaning? Sweep here. - Yes.

783
00:55:28,041 --> 00:55:30,541
Murari, what's wrong with Kundan? He is not talking to anyone.

784
00:55:31,041 --> 00:55:32,541
Forget him. Ask what is wrong the scooter.

785
00:55:33,041 --> 00:55:35,750
He drove my brand new scooter into the Ganges.

786
00:55:36,250 --> 00:55:36,875
I just took it to the mechanic. - Don't know what happened?

787
00:55:37,375 --> 00:55:39,666
He says the entire engine needs overhauling.

788
00:55:40,166 --> 00:55:43,333
Kundan. What have you done!

789
00:55:43,833 --> 00:55:47,750
Kundan. Get up. Get up.

790
00:55:48,250 --> 00:55:53,250
Get up.

791
00:55:53,750 --> 00:55:55,250
You think love is a joke?

792
00:55:55,750 --> 00:55:57,916
You slit your wrist as when you feel like.

793
00:55:58,416 --> 00:55:59,958
This seems more like UPSC examination and not love.

794
00:56:00,458 --> 00:56:01,375
You just can't pass it.

795
00:56:01,875 --> 00:56:03,333
Zoya loves someone else.

796
00:56:03,833 --> 00:56:06,791
To hell with your love. To hell with Zoya.

797
00:56:07,291 --> 00:56:08,958
Don't you cry like a sissy who has lost his love in front of me.

798
00:56:09,458 --> 00:56:11,250
And don't go to sleep.

799
00:56:11,750 --> 00:56:13,541
Beloved. My beloved.

800
00:56:14,041 --> 00:56:16,041
Tell me what the doctors said,

801
00:56:16,541 --> 00:56:18,500
Aunt, what do I know? I was busy settling things with Ramesh.

802
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:20,416
This is not the solution.

803
00:56:20,916 --> 00:56:23,375
Listen, Mr. Psychiatrist, are you done?

804
00:56:23,875 --> 00:56:24,833
So leave. - Okay.

805
00:56:25,333 --> 00:56:27,416
Don't use your brains too much.

806
00:56:27,916 --> 00:56:29,208
Eat it. - He's calling it suicide.

807
00:56:29,708 --> 00:56:31,500
As he said... He just... crazy.

808
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:36,791
He won't say that.

809
00:56:37,291 --> 00:56:39,125
I had been to your house.

810
00:56:39,625 --> 00:56:42,083
From there I came to know that you are here.

811
00:56:42,583 --> 00:56:45,750
Yes. You will find him here if you don't find him at home.

812
00:56:46,250 --> 00:56:47,708
He is in the hospital if he is not at home.

813
00:56:48,208 --> 00:56:54,000
Murari. - I want to talk to you.

814
00:56:54,500 --> 00:56:58,000
In private.

815
00:57:00,333 --> 00:57:02,083
Come, aunt. Let's go meet the doctor.

816
00:57:02,583 --> 00:57:03,416
Ask him what you were asking me.

817
00:57:03,916 --> 00:57:06,583
Bindiya, come on. Come on.

818
00:57:07,083 --> 00:57:10,791
Come with me.

819
00:57:11,291 --> 00:57:12,541
Apples are 180 rupees a kilo.

820
00:57:13,041 --> 00:57:15,291
You get vitamins from me. But you love them.

821
00:57:15,791 --> 00:57:19,291
What a stubborn boy!

822
00:57:21,916 --> 00:57:23,375
What a loser!

823
00:57:23,875 --> 00:57:25,541
Explain to your friend. She is a curse to us.

824
00:57:26,041 --> 00:57:29,541
Keep quiet.

825
00:57:34,875 --> 00:57:37,125
Zoya tried your number many times.

826
00:57:37,625 --> 00:57:41,125
She said that she wants to meet you.

827
00:58:07,041 --> 00:58:09,250
Zoya.

828
00:58:09,750 --> 00:58:16,750
I will give up my life if these people force me, Kundan.

829
00:58:17,250 --> 00:58:20,083
How did this happen? - Nothing.

830
00:58:20,583 --> 00:58:22,791
You slit your wrist again?

831
00:58:23,291 --> 00:58:25,500
How stupid can one be?

832
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:27,916
There is a limit to tolerance.

833
00:58:28,416 --> 00:58:30,750
Is this all you know to do?

834
00:58:31,250 --> 00:58:32,666
I made a mistake when I was small.

835
00:58:33,166 --> 00:58:36,791
So are you going to ruin my life for that?

836
00:58:37,291 --> 00:58:38,791
Come on.

837
00:58:39,291 --> 00:58:42,416
You want to marry, right? This is all you want, right?

838
00:58:42,916 --> 00:58:44,833
Let the world go to hell.

839
00:58:45,333 --> 00:58:50,250
What happened? Come on.

840
00:58:50,750 --> 00:58:54,250
Come on.

841
00:59:06,750 --> 00:59:08,875
Don't you understand, Kundan?

842
00:59:09,375 --> 00:59:13,041
You are a Hindu and I am Muslim.

843
00:59:13,541 --> 00:59:14,708
We are poles apart.

844
00:59:15,208 --> 00:59:17,583
You come to deliver gas cylinder to our house.

845
00:59:18,083 --> 00:59:21,416
Father likes you. So he gives the car for servicing.

846
00:59:21,916 --> 00:59:23,291
You carry mother's bag of grocery.

847
00:59:23,791 --> 00:59:24,875
You get flour for us.

848
00:59:25,375 --> 00:59:29,708
This doesn't mean they'll get their daughter married to you.

849
00:59:30,208 --> 00:59:33,000
I had imagined that you would help me if not anyone else.

850
00:59:33,500 --> 00:59:37,000
But you turned out to be my biggest enemy.

851
00:59:54,083 --> 00:59:57,166
I have shed blood. You shed tears.

852
00:59:57,666 --> 01:00:01,916
This seems more like a violent story than a love story.

853
01:00:02,416 --> 01:00:06,958
Go. Go home. Have food. Go to sleep.

854
01:00:07,458 --> 01:00:10,958
I'll come up with something. Go.

855
01:00:16,541 --> 01:00:17,625
What is your boyfriend's name?

856
01:00:18,125 --> 01:00:21,291
Should I call him Amitabh Bachchan?

857
01:00:21,791 --> 01:00:25,291
Akram. Akram Zaidi.

858
01:00:43,541 --> 01:00:45,750
Kundan! At this hour?

859
01:00:46,250 --> 01:00:54,291
Sir, the Hindu boy Zoya fell in love with 8 years ago..

860
01:00:54,791 --> 01:00:58,291
..was me.

861
01:01:12,458 --> 01:01:15,041
Because of whom you distanced Zoya from yourself.

862
01:01:15,541 --> 01:01:19,041
It was me, sir.

863
01:01:22,333 --> 01:01:24,750
I kept coming to your house so that I get close to you.

864
01:01:25,250 --> 01:01:26,791
I kept working for you like a servant hoping you would..

865
01:01:27,291 --> 01:01:31,833
..consider me family.

866
01:01:32,333 --> 01:01:36,500
Only to elope with Zoya when she returns one day.

867
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:38,208
What happened, Mr. Haider?

868
01:01:38,708 --> 01:01:41,458
But your daughter loves you a lot, sir.

869
01:01:41,958 --> 01:01:44,041
She cares a great deal about your honour.

870
01:01:44,541 --> 01:01:47,583
She had forgotten me 8 years ago.

871
01:01:48,083 --> 01:01:50,958
But the boy she loves so much.

872
01:01:51,458 --> 01:01:54,291
She wants to marry him with your consent only.

873
01:01:54,791 --> 01:01:55,750
She could've eloped, sir.

874
01:01:56,250 --> 01:01:58,291
And no one could've done a thing.

875
01:01:58,791 --> 01:02:01,708
You wouldn't have found anyone's collar to grab.

876
01:02:02,208 --> 01:02:05,333
And what problem do you have?

877
01:02:05,833 --> 01:02:07,208
He is a Muslim boy from a good family.

878
01:02:07,708 --> 01:02:11,208
He is well educated. Not an uncouth like me.

879
01:02:21,625 --> 01:02:21,958
What happened, pal?

880
01:02:22,458 --> 01:02:26,416
I am jacked up. Now do you want to help me?

881
01:02:26,916 --> 01:02:27,541
Get lost, moron.

882
01:02:28,041 --> 01:02:30,500
One by one. - Yes, I am giving. Hold on.

883
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:34,500
Now I won't give. Back up. Back up.

884
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:40,541
She is here. Go.

885
01:02:41,041 --> 01:02:44,833
I think this has been going for a bit too long.

886
01:02:45,333 --> 01:02:46,416
I think you should end it.

887
01:02:46,916 --> 01:02:48,083
Yes, I'm giving. Don't get desperate.

888
01:02:48,583 --> 01:02:53,041
No. I am not. I've run out of it.

889
01:02:53,541 --> 01:02:56,541
If you couldn't find sweets you could've ordered something else.

890
01:02:57,041 --> 01:02:58,541
Thank you. Thank you so much.

891
01:02:59,041 --> 01:03:02,541
Otherwise papa would've never understood.

892
01:03:08,541 --> 01:03:12,291
You made a fool out of me, Zoya.

893
01:03:12,791 --> 01:03:15,333
What do you think, Zoya?

894
01:03:15,833 --> 01:03:18,541
You are some damsel.

895
01:03:19,041 --> 01:03:21,666
Loving you was my talent, Zoya.

896
01:03:22,166 --> 01:03:25,250
You don't deserve any credit for it.

897
01:03:25,750 --> 01:03:27,291
Even if it had been anyone else instead of you..

898
01:03:27,791 --> 01:03:30,125
.. I would've loved her just as much.

899
01:03:30,625 --> 01:03:33,500
What do you think, Zoya?

900
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:37,500
You are the only one in the whole of Banaras for Kundan?

901
01:03:42,041 --> 01:03:46,541
I will marry the day you marry. Be it with a witch.

902
01:03:47,041 --> 01:03:48,666
I'll marry on that very day. As far as your marriage goes..

903
01:03:49,166 --> 01:03:52,000
..and I will do everything I can in it.

904
01:03:52,500 --> 01:03:54,291
I would rather die.

905
01:03:54,791 --> 01:04:00,250
But, I'll never utter your name again..

906
01:04:00,750 --> 01:04:04,250
..or, I'm a deadman.

907
01:04:15,833 --> 01:04:18,125
Look, forcing women is a crime.

908
01:04:18,625 --> 01:04:19,791
Why don't you listen to me.

909
01:04:20,291 --> 01:04:22,333
Her father's a police officer, we'll be jailed.

910
01:04:22,833 --> 01:04:25,333
Don't create a scene. You'll have to get a nose ring.

911
01:04:25,833 --> 01:04:29,333
This crazy girl's troubling me - Mummy.

912
01:04:33,041 --> 01:04:35,333
Bindiya. - What is it?

913
01:04:35,833 --> 01:04:38,958
You were really fond of marrying me, right?

914
01:04:39,458 --> 01:04:43,958
Tell your father. To call the confectioner and the priest.

915
01:04:44,458 --> 01:04:46,333
You're getting married to me.

916
01:04:46,833 --> 01:04:50,333
On the 21st.

917
01:05:26,708 --> 01:05:30,750
Tell me. Tell me. What is this, my friend?

918
01:05:31,250 --> 01:05:35,333
Tell me. Tell me. What is this mystery?

919
01:05:35,833 --> 01:05:39,916
Tell me. Tell me. What is this, my friend?

920
01:05:40,416 --> 01:05:44,375
Tell me. Tell me. What is this mystery?

921
01:05:44,875 --> 01:05:49,583
What is this mystery? Am I the mystery?

922
01:05:50,083 --> 01:05:54,166
What is this mystery? Am I the mystery?

923
01:05:54,666 --> 01:05:58,166
What is this mystery? Am I the mystery?

924
01:06:25,791 --> 01:06:29,916
Everything changes in a flash.

925
01:06:30,416 --> 01:06:35,125
I have life long bond with her.

926
01:06:35,625 --> 01:06:39,625
At times it seems populated. And at times deserted.

927
01:06:40,125 --> 01:06:44,291
There can be no marriage without friends.

928
01:06:44,791 --> 01:06:48,708
There can be no marriage without friends.

929
01:06:49,208 --> 01:06:52,708
There can be no marriage without friends.

930
01:07:13,541 --> 01:07:17,583
He can plunge me into darkness.

931
01:07:18,083 --> 01:07:22,125
Or light up my life.

932
01:07:22,625 --> 01:07:26,833
He can plunge me into darkness.

933
01:07:27,333 --> 01:07:32,000
Or light up my life.

934
01:07:32,500 --> 01:07:36,541
I cherish weird dreams.

935
01:07:37,041 --> 01:07:41,166
There is no season without your beloved.

936
01:07:41,666 --> 01:07:49,833
There is no season without your beloved.

937
01:07:50,333 --> 01:07:54,416
He makes torments me when he is with me.

938
01:07:54,916 --> 01:07:58,916
He makes torments me when he is with me.

939
01:07:59,416 --> 01:08:03,500
He is nowhere to be seen even though he is near me.

940
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:08,041
When he is near me, he jinxes me.

941
01:08:08,541 --> 01:08:12,583
My desires always stay with him.

942
01:08:13,083 --> 01:08:17,541
My desires always stay with him.

943
01:08:18,041 --> 01:08:22,082
I do everything in my power for him.

944
01:08:22,582 --> 01:08:26,625
And there are no friends without mates.

945
01:08:27,125 --> 01:08:30,625
And there are no friends without mates.

946
01:08:50,582 --> 01:08:53,375
What happened, pal?

947
01:08:53,875 --> 01:08:58,125
A lover doesn't get petrified when his love is about to get married.

948
01:08:58,625 --> 01:09:01,291
He gets petrified when he is about to get married.

949
01:09:01,791 --> 01:09:05,291
Let him cry. It is his doing.

950
01:09:14,416 --> 01:09:19,582
Enough. Stop. Stop.

951
01:09:20,082 --> 01:09:26,457
Why is this happening with me, Murari?

952
01:09:26,957 --> 01:09:31,666
One minute. One minute, Kundan.

953
01:09:32,166 --> 01:09:35,291
What the..

954
01:09:35,791 --> 01:09:39,291
Yes, I am fine. - Take a look.

955
01:09:50,500 --> 01:09:53,832
Kundan. Kundan, you are mad. Listen to me.

956
01:09:54,332 --> 01:09:55,750
Kundan, where are you going?

957
01:09:56,250 --> 01:09:59,750
Kundan, where are you going? Are you mad?

958
01:10:17,416 --> 01:10:20,375
I won't be able to eat all that.

959
01:10:20,875 --> 01:10:24,375
Kundan. What happened?

960
01:10:27,791 --> 01:10:31,291
Complete it.

961
01:10:35,666 --> 01:10:39,000
Complete it.

962
01:10:39,500 --> 01:10:43,000
Kundan, what happened?

963
01:10:49,957 --> 01:10:53,625
I learnt at least that in your love.

964
01:10:54,125 --> 01:10:55,832
You should've taught him something.

965
01:10:56,332 --> 01:10:59,832
What's happening?

966
01:11:03,416 --> 01:11:06,916
What happened?

967
01:11:16,207 --> 01:11:19,707
He is Hindu.

968
01:11:34,041 --> 01:11:35,500
'And with that incident..'

969
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:36,832
'..this beautiful chapter came to an end.'

970
01:11:37,332 --> 01:11:38,500
'It was time to wage war.'

971
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:42,500
'All hail Lord Ram.'

972
01:11:46,707 --> 01:11:51,957
No one's a kin..

973
01:11:52,457 --> 01:12:00,291
No one's a kin..

974
01:12:00,791 --> 01:12:03,041
Kundan, what are you doing?

975
01:12:03,541 --> 01:12:04,625
Zoya has slit her wrist.

976
01:12:05,125 --> 01:12:06,000
There was blood all over the house.

977
01:12:06,500 --> 01:12:10,082
She's been taken to a hospital. Let's go.

978
01:12:10,582 --> 01:12:12,125
Which hospital has she been taken too? - The one at Hanuman Fatak.

979
01:12:12,625 --> 01:12:13,082
And, the boy Akram? - Hey

980
01:12:13,582 --> 01:12:15,166
He was badly beaten up. They smashed his head.

981
01:12:15,666 --> 01:12:17,957
And, these boys dumped him somewhere.

982
01:12:18,457 --> 01:12:21,332
Don't try to act smart with us.

983
01:12:21,832 --> 01:12:22,582
It wasn't me.

984
01:12:23,082 --> 01:12:24,500
It was Nawaz and Guddu.

985
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:26,541
I left from the Kent Railway Station.

986
01:12:27,041 --> 01:12:29,541
They were still beating him up.

987
01:12:30,041 --> 01:12:33,500
Stay in your senses.

988
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:37,500
Kundan!

989
01:12:40,500 --> 01:12:45,166
He was my brother.

990
01:12:45,666 --> 01:12:47,457
Akram! -Akram!

991
01:12:47,957 --> 01:12:50,541
Jasjeet!

992
01:12:51,041 --> 01:12:53,750
Jasjeet! -Jasjeet!

993
01:12:54,250 --> 01:12:55,291
Murari..-Jasjeet!

994
01:12:55,791 --> 01:12:57,541
Jasjeet!

995
01:12:58,041 --> 01:13:01,541
Oh no!

996
01:13:02,041 --> 01:13:03,666
Jasjeet!

997
01:13:04,166 --> 01:13:05,582
Jasjeet! Jasjeet! - They really thrashed me up.

998
01:13:06,082 --> 01:13:07,916
Lift him up. - Jasjeet.

999
01:13:08,416 --> 01:13:11,041
Move. Move. - Get aside.

1000
01:13:11,541 --> 01:13:15,041
Move. - Move.

1001
01:13:22,416 --> 01:13:24,041
Doctor!

1002
01:13:24,541 --> 01:13:28,041
He's fine now.

1003
01:13:30,291 --> 01:13:35,082
I'll be back soon.

1004
01:13:35,582 --> 01:13:36,707
She's better now.

1005
01:13:37,207 --> 01:13:40,707
But, she's lost lot of blood.

1006
01:13:48,207 --> 01:13:52,332
Weren't you getting married today as well?

1007
01:13:52,832 --> 01:13:56,332
Oh no! Darn it!

1008
01:14:07,207 --> 01:14:08,250
You go alone, Pal.

1009
01:14:08,750 --> 01:14:12,250
I cannot face this.

1010
01:14:20,041 --> 01:14:22,832
He's here.

1011
01:14:23,332 --> 01:14:24,707
The groom's here. - He's here.

1012
01:14:25,207 --> 01:14:28,707
I was trying to sleep, but couldn't. Start playing.

1013
01:14:49,207 --> 01:14:52,707
He's here.

1014
01:15:01,041 --> 01:15:05,457
Why did you do such a terrible thing with this girl?

1015
01:15:05,957 --> 01:15:09,332
Move.

1016
01:15:09,832 --> 01:15:13,332
Get out of this house. Don't ever show me your face again.

1017
01:16:15,957 --> 01:16:19,500
I knew it all the time.

1018
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:22,832
But, it was too late.

1019
01:16:23,332 --> 01:16:28,541
Wouldn't have made a difference.

1020
01:16:29,041 --> 01:16:35,916
The Delhi government couldn't lay a finger on me.

1021
01:16:36,416 --> 01:16:40,707
But, a girl got me messed up.

1022
01:16:41,207 --> 01:16:43,041
Same with me.

1023
01:16:43,541 --> 01:16:51,457
Like a fool, I did as she said.

1024
01:16:51,957 --> 01:16:57,250
You should never pay heed to a girl's suggestions.

1025
01:16:57,750 --> 01:17:00,500
There's lot of work I still got to do.

1026
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:02,666
If I don't get well soon..

1027
01:17:03,166 --> 01:17:05,875
..who's going to raise his voice in the Parliament.

1028
01:17:06,375 --> 01:17:10,500
What line had we thought of telling to this champ here?

1029
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:12,041
What was it? - My, my, your principals..

1030
01:17:12,541 --> 01:17:15,250
My, my. Your principals. - These ideologies.

1031
01:17:15,750 --> 01:17:17,000
These ideologies.

1032
01:17:17,500 --> 01:17:20,082
You can't get one time meal..

1033
01:17:20,582 --> 01:17:24,332
These things can't get you even one time meal.

1034
01:17:24,832 --> 01:17:28,625
And the rallies you have on streets and the slogans and all.

1035
01:17:29,125 --> 01:17:34,291
This is not going to be of any use. Got it?

1036
01:17:34,791 --> 01:17:38,957
Join our party. True happiness is in being in power.

1037
01:17:39,457 --> 01:17:41,000
You hail from Jalandhar, right?

1038
01:17:41,500 --> 01:17:43,625
I'll get a ticket from Jalandhar area.

1039
01:17:44,125 --> 01:17:47,166
Anand, what had we thought of replying to Mr. Gupta?

1040
01:17:47,666 --> 01:17:48,416
First go and get the sign of the man...

1041
01:17:48,916 --> 01:17:49,541
Yes.

1042
01:17:50,041 --> 01:17:53,000
First go and get the sign of the man whom you have been fooling..

1043
01:17:53,500 --> 01:17:56,041
..for the last 60 years.

1044
01:17:56,541 --> 01:18:00,707
And then I'm ready to sign any paper you give me, Mr. Gupta.

1045
01:18:01,207 --> 01:18:03,041
Why will we fight the elections from Jalandhar..

1046
01:18:03,541 --> 01:18:04,957
..when we can win from Delhi.

1047
01:18:05,457 --> 01:18:07,375
We'll fight. And create our own party.

1048
01:18:07,875 --> 01:18:11,375
Thank you for the offer, sir.

1049
01:18:13,457 --> 01:18:14,666
And sir, you are right.

1050
01:18:15,166 --> 01:18:17,041
Real happiness is in being in power.

1051
01:18:17,541 --> 01:18:20,750
The rest is rubbish.

1052
01:18:21,250 --> 01:18:27,082
Did you saw that? - Yes.

1053
01:18:27,582 --> 01:18:31,582
We're boys of free will.

1054
01:18:32,082 --> 01:18:36,332
We can ride the winds as well.

1055
01:18:36,832 --> 01:18:41,000
The path of love, is a difficult one.

1056
01:18:41,500 --> 01:18:48,166
Be brave...give me your heart without a care.

1057
01:18:48,666 --> 01:18:52,750
Learn to be faithful from us.

1058
01:18:53,250 --> 01:18:56,750
Get some fresh air from us.

1059
01:19:04,541 --> 01:19:08,582
The stories of the heart. The days in our share.

1060
01:19:09,082 --> 01:19:12,666
Can only be spent from the heart.

1061
01:19:13,166 --> 01:19:21,041
Get rid of all the fears.

1062
01:19:21,541 --> 01:19:30,250
Forget the worries. Destroy the fears.

1063
01:19:30,750 --> 01:19:32,916
Sweetheart, come with me.

1064
01:19:33,416 --> 01:19:36,832
Come, the world of dreams awaits you.

1065
01:19:37,332 --> 01:19:45,541
The one who is alive in the true sense can conquer the world.

1066
01:19:46,041 --> 01:19:49,541
He will breathe freely.

1067
01:20:00,207 --> 01:20:04,332
Learn to be faithful from us.

1068
01:20:04,832 --> 01:20:09,041
Get some fresh air from us.

1069
01:20:09,541 --> 01:20:13,041
Join the path of truth.

1070
01:20:20,125 --> 01:20:21,875
Let's go everyone, to the big house. - How's everything? All okay?

1071
01:20:22,375 --> 01:20:24,707
Mr. Salim, how are you? - Great.

1072
01:20:25,207 --> 01:20:25,916
You came here personally.

1073
01:20:26,416 --> 01:20:28,625
You've done such a thing that we have to come time and again.

1074
01:20:29,125 --> 01:20:29,541
Aunt?

1075
01:20:30,041 --> 01:20:31,166
Good to see you, Seema. I'm coming back tomorrow.

1076
01:20:31,666 --> 01:20:32,832
We've such immense pressure from our seniors to arrest you.

1077
01:20:33,332 --> 01:20:34,666
We have been sent to arrest you.

1078
01:20:35,166 --> 01:20:36,750
How is everyone at home? - Great.

1079
01:20:37,250 --> 01:20:38,625
Officer, you too are here. - Yes.

1080
01:20:39,125 --> 01:20:40,125
Where are you going, sir?

1081
01:20:40,625 --> 01:20:41,541
Come. Let me show you the jail.

1082
01:20:42,041 --> 01:20:44,375
No. No. Good for you, sir.

1083
01:20:44,875 --> 01:20:48,500
What can I do if I'm destined to marry a criminal?

1084
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:50,707
Excuse me.

1085
01:20:51,207 --> 01:20:53,416
What criminal, madam?

1086
01:20:53,916 --> 01:20:55,166
I am about to be the CM.

1087
01:20:55,666 --> 01:20:59,041
And if lady luck shines on me, then I'll be the PM some day.

1088
01:20:59,541 --> 01:21:00,291
This is the chance you have.

1089
01:21:00,791 --> 01:21:03,166
If you marry me, your life will be risk free.

1090
01:21:03,666 --> 01:21:06,207
Or carry on with your street plays in Dariaganj.

1091
01:21:06,707 --> 01:21:09,250
I see. And who'll ask my parents?

1092
01:21:09,750 --> 01:21:13,582
Parents? If you say, I can ask the entire nation.

1093
01:21:14,082 --> 01:21:19,166
I will announce it from Red Fort on 15th August.

1094
01:21:19,666 --> 01:21:20,666
Let's go, sir.

1095
01:21:21,166 --> 01:21:24,416
Injustice won't be tolerated. Injustice won't be tolerated.

1096
01:21:24,916 --> 01:21:28,291
Let's see if your jail's can hold us.

1097
01:21:28,791 --> 01:21:32,332
Let's see if you really got the guts.

1098
01:21:32,832 --> 01:21:36,250
Let's see if your jail's can hold us.

1099
01:21:36,750 --> 01:21:39,541
Let's see if you really got the guts.

1100
01:21:40,041 --> 01:21:45,125
After that, Zoya left for Beneras.

1101
01:21:45,625 --> 01:21:47,207
She called few days ago.

1102
01:21:47,707 --> 01:21:48,791
Are you insane?

1103
01:21:49,291 --> 01:21:49,957
Who's going to put up this act?

1104
01:21:50,457 --> 01:21:51,707
Just spare a week for me, please.

1105
01:21:52,207 --> 01:21:52,916
Everything will be fine.

1106
01:21:53,416 --> 01:21:57,500
Zoya, this is nonsense. I've too much left to do.

1107
01:21:58,000 --> 01:21:59,416
Everything was fine.

1108
01:21:59,916 --> 01:22:02,957
Everything under control.

1109
01:22:03,457 --> 01:22:05,000
And now...

1110
01:22:05,500 --> 01:22:09,000
Everything's shattered.

1111
01:22:25,625 --> 01:22:27,166
Father, this is Kundan.

1112
01:22:27,666 --> 01:22:29,375
He saved brother.

1113
01:22:29,875 --> 01:22:30,750
Otherwise, brother wouldn't have made it alive..

1114
01:22:31,250 --> 01:22:34,750
..from the accident.

1115
01:22:37,207 --> 01:22:40,125
Thank you son, you've been a big help.

1116
01:22:40,625 --> 01:22:43,041
But, we don't understand a thing here,

1117
01:22:43,541 --> 01:22:44,957
We're taking him back to Punjab.

1118
01:22:45,457 --> 01:22:46,082
He's lost a lot of blood.

1119
01:22:46,582 --> 01:22:50,082
But, there's nothing to worry about.

1120
01:22:53,707 --> 01:22:56,082
I'll need a tempo.

1121
01:22:56,582 --> 01:22:58,416
What's cooking in your mind now?

1122
01:22:58,916 --> 01:23:00,750
And, two train tickets to Punjab.

1123
01:23:01,250 --> 01:23:02,041
Tickets?

1124
01:23:02,541 --> 01:23:05,000
What for?

1125
01:23:05,500 --> 01:23:09,000
Elope! With Zoya.

1126
01:23:09,500 --> 01:23:10,832
Tonight.

1127
01:23:11,332 --> 01:23:12,750
Have you lost it, Pal?

1128
01:23:13,250 --> 01:23:14,291
You think Zoya will come with you.

1129
01:23:14,791 --> 01:23:16,207
I'll just take her to Jasjeet.

1130
01:23:16,707 --> 01:23:18,957
You'll get yourself killed. She'll never take a favor from you.

1131
01:23:19,457 --> 01:23:20,457
I don't have a choice.

1132
01:23:20,957 --> 01:23:24,457
Kundan, there's a limit to..

1133
01:23:33,250 --> 01:23:36,750
Just do as I'm saying..

1134
01:24:27,125 --> 01:24:28,625
Jasjeet's fine.

1135
01:24:29,125 --> 01:24:33,041
He's hurt, but fine.

1136
01:24:33,541 --> 01:24:39,582
His parents took him back home.

1137
01:24:40,082 --> 01:24:44,582
I made a big mistake.

1138
01:24:45,082 --> 01:24:46,582
But, I swear..

1139
01:24:47,082 --> 01:24:54,457
I'll take you to Jasjeet.

1140
01:24:54,957 --> 01:24:58,457
What?

1141
01:25:45,916 --> 01:25:50,625
The one you're searching for, dwells in your heart.

1142
01:25:51,125 --> 01:25:55,875
There's a sea inside you, stop looking for droplets.

1143
01:25:56,375 --> 01:26:01,250
The one you're searching for, dwells in your heart.

1144
01:26:01,750 --> 01:26:06,500
There's a sea inside you, stop looking for droplets.

1145
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:14,375
Clear all your doubts.

1146
01:26:14,875 --> 01:26:16,916
Clear all your doubts.

1147
01:26:17,416 --> 01:26:19,332
Lift the veil.

1148
01:26:19,832 --> 01:26:22,291
Beloved.

1149
01:26:22,791 --> 01:26:24,582
Beloved.

1150
01:26:25,082 --> 01:26:29,791
You will see your beloved.

1151
01:26:30,291 --> 01:26:35,500
You will see your beloved.

1152
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:40,707
The one you're searching for, dwells in your heart.

1153
01:26:41,207 --> 01:26:46,000
There's a sea inside you, stop looking for droplets.

1154
01:26:46,500 --> 01:26:51,332
Clear all your doubts.

1155
01:26:51,832 --> 01:26:53,957
Clear all your doubts.

1156
01:26:54,457 --> 01:26:56,291
Lift the veil.

1157
01:26:56,791 --> 01:26:59,250
You will see your beloved.

1158
01:26:59,750 --> 01:27:01,541
You will see your beloved.

1159
01:27:02,041 --> 01:27:06,707
You will see your beloved.

1160
01:27:07,207 --> 01:27:11,750
You will see your beloved.

1161
01:27:12,250 --> 01:27:16,916
No point in seeing what others do.

1162
01:27:17,416 --> 01:27:22,291
No point in seeing what others do.

1163
01:27:22,791 --> 01:27:27,541
Try to see what the others can.

1164
01:27:28,041 --> 01:27:32,916
Try to see what the others can.

1165
01:27:33,416 --> 01:27:38,707
You can't see with the naked eye.

1166
01:27:39,207 --> 01:27:43,666
Close your eyes, and you can see it.

1167
01:27:44,166 --> 01:27:47,666
You will see your beloved.

1168
01:28:39,375 --> 01:28:44,250
You don't always get what you want.

1169
01:28:44,750 --> 01:28:49,541
My companion is only my shadow.

1170
01:28:50,041 --> 01:28:55,457
You robbed me of my heart.

1171
01:28:55,957 --> 01:29:00,416
Yet you whisper softly.

1172
01:29:00,916 --> 01:29:05,625
You will see your beloved.

1173
01:29:06,125 --> 01:29:11,291
You will see your beloved.

1174
01:29:11,791 --> 01:29:16,582
The one you're searching for, dwells in your heart.

1175
01:29:17,082 --> 01:29:21,750
There's a sea inside you, stop looking for droplets.

1176
01:29:22,250 --> 01:29:29,666
Clear all your doubts.

1177
01:29:30,166 --> 01:29:32,416
Clear all your doubts.

1178
01:29:32,916 --> 01:29:34,666
Lift the veil.

1179
01:29:35,166 --> 01:29:39,832
Beloved.

1180
01:29:40,332 --> 01:29:42,582
You will see your beloved.

1181
01:29:43,082 --> 01:29:46,582
You will see your beloved.

1182
01:29:58,207 --> 01:30:03,041
Go away.

1183
01:30:03,541 --> 01:30:08,332
You will see your beloved.

1184
01:30:08,832 --> 01:30:13,875
You will see your beloved.

1185
01:30:14,375 --> 01:30:19,250
The one you're searching for, dwells in your heart.

1186
01:30:19,750 --> 01:30:23,250
There's a sea inside you, stop looking for droplets.

1187
01:30:59,041 --> 01:31:02,375
Bring it, dear. Baba will bless you.

1188
01:31:02,875 --> 01:31:04,332
Hey. Priest. Leave.

1189
01:31:04,832 --> 01:31:08,332
Go on. Go.

1190
01:31:10,541 --> 01:31:15,500
You know, many of the sages here are cheats.

1191
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:17,375
Castouts.

1192
01:31:17,875 --> 01:31:19,416
Bloody criminals.

1193
01:31:19,916 --> 01:31:21,375
Murderer, rapists.

1194
01:31:21,875 --> 01:31:23,707
They just dawn the saffron color..

1195
01:31:24,207 --> 01:31:27,707
..and mingle along with the real ones.

1196
01:31:30,791 --> 01:31:35,916
Whom did you kill?

1197
01:31:36,416 --> 01:31:39,166
I can see it on your face.

1198
01:31:39,666 --> 01:31:49,000
No faith in this world can pardon a murderer.

1199
01:31:49,500 --> 01:31:53,082
Go. Do something.

1200
01:31:53,582 --> 01:31:55,541
Don't know what?

1201
01:31:56,041 --> 01:31:59,541
But, you won't get salvation at the banks of Ganges.

1202
01:32:13,375 --> 01:32:14,666
Hello. - Murari.

1203
01:32:15,166 --> 01:32:17,250
Where are you?

1204
01:32:17,750 --> 01:32:19,582
I've been thinking about you.

1205
01:32:20,082 --> 01:32:23,541
Is Zoya in Beneras? - In Beneras? Is she?

1206
01:32:24,041 --> 01:32:25,582
That's exactly what I'm asking. Is she?

1207
01:32:26,082 --> 01:32:26,916
Rascal, you eloped with her.

1208
01:32:27,416 --> 01:32:28,957
Do you know the chaos it led to?

1209
01:32:29,457 --> 01:32:30,416
What are you doing? Where are you?

1210
01:32:30,916 --> 01:32:34,416
And, where's Zoya?

1211
01:32:39,832 --> 01:32:41,957
Seeking him. Feeling him.

1212
01:32:42,457 --> 01:32:47,207
Either its you, or its him.

1213
01:32:47,707 --> 01:32:49,832
Seeking him. Feeling him.

1214
01:32:50,332 --> 01:32:55,082
Either its you, or its him.

1215
01:32:55,582 --> 01:33:03,041
Without him, everything's vain.

1216
01:33:03,541 --> 01:33:06,166
You will see your beloved.

1217
01:33:06,666 --> 01:33:08,541
You will see your beloved.

1218
01:33:09,041 --> 01:33:13,625
You will see your beloved.

1219
01:33:14,125 --> 01:33:20,666
You will see your beloved.

1220
01:33:21,166 --> 01:33:22,707
People look, stare at you.

1221
01:33:23,207 --> 01:33:26,750
Humiliate you with their stare. Disrobe you.

1222
01:33:27,250 --> 01:33:30,957
And say We're just looking.

1223
01:33:31,457 --> 01:33:33,166
They whistle, sing songs..

1224
01:33:33,666 --> 01:33:38,250
..and tell their friends about it, show-off that they're men.

1225
01:33:38,750 --> 01:33:41,541
And say, We were just looking, it's not a crime.

1226
01:33:42,041 --> 01:33:43,082
Are you alive?

1227
01:33:43,582 --> 01:33:44,750
Are you alive?

1228
01:33:45,250 --> 01:33:46,416
Are you alive?

1229
01:33:46,916 --> 01:33:48,000
Are you alive?

1230
01:33:48,500 --> 01:33:49,582
Are you alive?

1231
01:33:50,082 --> 01:33:50,957
Are you alive?

1232
01:33:51,457 --> 01:33:53,832
Are you alive?

1233
01:33:54,332 --> 01:33:55,250
Is everyone here?

1234
01:33:55,750 --> 01:33:59,250
Zoya, let's go. - Yes, drive this vehicle.

1235
01:34:22,125 --> 01:34:26,500
What's wrong? - Just a second.

1236
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:28,750
Hey!

1237
01:34:29,250 --> 01:34:31,082
What are you doing?

1238
01:34:31,582 --> 01:34:33,000
Hey. - Hey.

1239
01:34:33,500 --> 01:34:34,582
We had to wrestle the management..

1240
01:34:35,082 --> 01:34:36,041
..to install that pipe.

1241
01:34:36,541 --> 01:34:37,791
Don't break it.

1242
01:34:38,291 --> 01:34:41,291
Who are you? What're you doing?

1243
01:34:41,791 --> 01:34:44,916
And, why are you climbing up the pipe?

1244
01:34:45,416 --> 01:34:48,500
I...am a thief.

1245
01:34:49,000 --> 01:34:50,041
I was here to steal.

1246
01:34:50,541 --> 01:34:52,500
Why don't we turn him in?

1247
01:34:53,000 --> 01:34:56,332
That will mean we believe in this administration system.

1248
01:34:56,832 --> 01:34:58,291
I know, it's a completely ruthless..

1249
01:34:58,791 --> 01:35:00,041
..and a politically aggressive system.

1250
01:35:00,541 --> 01:35:02,291
Correct. And, we should be against it.

1251
01:35:02,791 --> 01:35:04,666
He's a victim of this system as well.

1252
01:35:05,166 --> 01:35:07,707
Samosa (Fritters). - Huh!

1253
01:35:08,207 --> 01:35:10,375
Two Samosas.

1254
01:35:10,875 --> 01:35:12,332
Samosa?

1255
01:35:12,832 --> 01:35:14,707
Chotu. Samosas.

1256
01:35:15,207 --> 01:35:16,125
Two.

1257
01:35:16,625 --> 01:35:18,875
So, we need to understand..

1258
01:35:19,375 --> 01:35:21,332
..why would anyone become a thief.

1259
01:35:21,832 --> 01:35:25,332
Why did you become one?

1260
01:35:28,082 --> 01:35:32,541
Because...I'm poor.

1261
01:35:33,041 --> 01:35:35,666
Water.. - Huh!

1262
01:35:36,166 --> 01:35:38,916
Tea...

1263
01:35:39,416 --> 01:35:42,250
Poverty is a result of over-population.

1264
01:35:42,750 --> 01:35:44,541
Don't simplify things.

1265
01:35:45,041 --> 01:35:47,666
Over-population is a result of lack of education.

1266
01:35:48,166 --> 01:35:49,332
But, lower-classes don't have resources..

1267
01:35:49,832 --> 01:35:50,541
..to educate their children.

1268
01:35:51,041 --> 01:35:51,582
No, no. One minute.

1269
01:35:52,082 --> 01:35:53,291
Even the educated youth in this country..

1270
01:35:53,791 --> 01:35:55,041
..are suffering from unemployment

1271
01:35:55,541 --> 01:35:56,375
I agree. - No. I am sorry.

1272
01:35:56,875 --> 01:35:58,791
Becoming a thief cannot be justified. - She is also right.

1273
01:35:59,291 --> 01:36:02,791
He's asleep.

1274
01:36:07,666 --> 01:36:11,166
Bro. Bro.

1275
01:36:17,625 --> 01:36:22,875
We know why you became a thief. - Why?

1276
01:36:23,375 --> 01:36:29,916
Because you're poor. - And you don't have a job. Right?

1277
01:36:30,416 --> 01:36:31,082
Yes.

1278
01:36:31,582 --> 01:36:35,750
I'm poor, and I don't have a job.

1279
01:36:36,250 --> 01:36:38,125
Kundan, get a cup of tea.

1280
01:36:38,625 --> 01:36:42,125
Give me a cold drink.

1281
01:36:59,916 --> 01:37:03,416
Go ahead, I'll be right with you.

1282
01:37:09,000 --> 01:37:13,666
What now?

1283
01:37:14,166 --> 01:37:19,291
I'd rather work myself to death here, than die of guilt.

1284
01:37:19,791 --> 01:37:25,291
And, I don't know why I'm here.

1285
01:37:25,791 --> 01:37:29,291
Let me stay here. Please.

1286
01:37:34,750 --> 01:37:35,916
Nothing's changed.

1287
01:37:36,416 --> 01:37:38,957
Jasjeet's 'All India Citizen's Party'..

1288
01:37:39,457 --> 01:37:41,375
..will still run in the upcoming elections.

1289
01:37:41,875 --> 01:37:44,875
His hard work can't go to waste.

1290
01:37:45,375 --> 01:37:48,082
I nominate Zoya as the new leader.

1291
01:37:48,582 --> 01:37:52,082
Those who agree, raise your hands.

1292
01:37:56,625 --> 01:38:01,707
So, we need to decide what's next.

1293
01:38:02,207 --> 01:38:03,332
We should do something..

1294
01:38:03,832 --> 01:38:04,500
..about the 'Bhatta Parsal' scam.

1295
01:38:05,000 --> 01:38:07,832
Around 4000 farmers are losing their lands.

1296
01:38:08,332 --> 01:38:09,666
Only to put up a factory.

1297
01:38:10,166 --> 01:38:12,791
The media must be present as well.

1298
01:38:13,291 --> 01:38:15,250
We can gain a lot of political mileage.

1299
01:38:15,750 --> 01:38:20,375
Fine. Let's meet here tomorrow at 11am.

1300
01:38:20,875 --> 01:38:22,541
The girl's got the spark.

1301
01:38:23,041 --> 01:38:24,332
We'll teach her the rest.

1302
01:38:24,832 --> 01:38:27,375
These are the basic things in politics.

1303
01:38:27,875 --> 01:38:33,957
Zoya. - I don't care a damn if he lives or dies.

1304
01:38:34,457 --> 01:38:36,541
There's nothing to discuss about him, Rashmi.

1305
01:38:37,041 --> 01:38:40,541
There's much left to do, and he doesn't exist for me

1306
01:38:49,166 --> 01:38:52,666
Come on, give the tea.

1307
01:39:12,166 --> 01:39:18,791
Don't look at me...like that.

1308
01:39:19,291 --> 01:39:26,041
Don't look at me...like that.

1309
01:39:26,541 --> 01:39:33,375
Like you never saw me before.

1310
01:39:33,875 --> 01:39:36,957
Like you never saw me before.

1311
01:39:37,457 --> 01:39:40,791
He'll never learn. Where are you going? Stop Kundan.

1312
01:39:41,291 --> 01:39:47,625
Don't look at me...like that.

1313
01:39:48,125 --> 01:39:56,125
Don't look at me...like that.

1314
01:39:56,625 --> 01:40:02,791
Load all the flags.

1315
01:40:03,291 --> 01:40:05,082
Anand.

1316
01:40:05,582 --> 01:40:08,291
Take me along. - What will you possibly do, Kundan?

1317
01:40:08,791 --> 01:40:10,375
Lend a helping hand.

1318
01:40:10,875 --> 01:40:14,375
Or, serve you all tea. - Climb on.

1319
01:40:30,957 --> 01:40:32,291
Come on. Who else?

1320
01:40:32,791 --> 01:40:33,416
Stand straight.

1321
01:40:33,916 --> 01:40:35,750
Don't let anyone come this side.

1322
01:40:36,250 --> 01:40:36,832
Be ready.

1323
01:40:37,332 --> 01:40:39,666
Shoot anyone you see. Get that.

1324
01:40:40,166 --> 01:40:41,750
No one.. Stand straight.

1325
01:40:42,250 --> 01:40:43,500
We're ready to talk.

1326
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:46,541
Let us talk to your headman.

1327
01:40:47,041 --> 01:40:49,000
The government will talk to you. - You stay here.

1328
01:40:49,500 --> 01:40:52,250
Who are you? - What about th extra forces?

1329
01:40:52,750 --> 01:40:53,457
We want to meet the farmers?

1330
01:40:53,957 --> 01:40:56,416
Farmers? Who are you?

1331
01:40:56,916 --> 01:40:58,832
Get lost! - You cannot stop us.

1332
01:40:59,332 --> 01:41:00,416
Our party's running for elections this year.

1333
01:41:00,916 --> 01:41:02,000
We're here to meet the people of our constituency.

1334
01:41:02,500 --> 01:41:06,375
Ma'am. They've kidnapped a PSE soldier.

1335
01:41:06,875 --> 01:41:08,457
And, they shot at the DM's leg yesterday.

1336
01:41:08,957 --> 01:41:11,416
If they don't return that soldier, they'll be shot.

1337
01:41:11,916 --> 01:41:13,750
You've an excuse to shoot them.

1338
01:41:14,250 --> 01:41:15,707
It's a golden opportunity for this corrupt government..

1339
01:41:16,207 --> 01:41:16,916
..to take away their lands.

1340
01:41:17,416 --> 01:41:18,332
You're raising your voice at the wrong place.

1341
01:41:18,832 --> 01:41:21,375
Get that. SP sir has arrived.

1342
01:41:21,875 --> 01:41:23,750
Come on. Get lost.

1343
01:41:24,250 --> 01:41:27,166
What's the position? - The position's really bad.

1344
01:41:27,666 --> 01:41:31,957
Sir, we've seized the entire area.

1345
01:41:32,457 --> 01:41:35,791
Look. I give you five minutes..

1346
01:41:36,291 --> 01:41:37,541
The farmers were wrong.

1347
01:41:38,041 --> 01:41:38,832
They just gave the government..

1348
01:41:39,332 --> 01:41:40,207
..an excuse to shoot them.

1349
01:41:40,707 --> 01:41:42,375
They'll just target the main leaders and kill them.

1350
01:41:42,875 --> 01:41:44,250
And the government will say..

1351
01:41:44,750 --> 01:41:47,707
..We were only trying to save the PSE soldier.

1352
01:41:48,207 --> 01:41:51,125
The people will blame the farmers.

1353
01:41:51,625 --> 01:41:53,582
We'll have to talk to the SP.

1354
01:41:54,082 --> 01:41:55,250
Anant. - Yeah!

1355
01:41:55,750 --> 01:41:58,250
Talk to the media. Tell them about the situation going on here.

1356
01:41:58,750 --> 01:42:00,791
..we'll have to take harsh action.

1357
01:42:01,291 --> 01:42:02,291
Sir, we know what you're trying to do here.

1358
01:42:02,791 --> 01:42:03,666
We tried talking to them sir, but they aren't listening, sir.

1359
01:42:04,166 --> 01:42:05,457
Sir, excuse me sir!

1360
01:42:05,957 --> 01:42:07,500
I know you must be following your seniors orders..

1361
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:08,750
..but, you cannot do this.

1362
01:42:09,250 --> 01:42:11,500
Actually, I can do anything I want.

1363
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:15,207
I can have you all arrested.

1364
01:42:15,707 --> 01:42:17,500
Don't do this. Behave yourself. - Move back.

1365
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:19,666
Please don't do this. - Let us talk to them

1366
01:42:20,166 --> 01:42:21,875
This is the last warning for you. - Move aside.

1367
01:42:22,375 --> 01:42:24,207
Sir, sir!

1368
01:42:24,707 --> 01:42:28,207
Let us go inside. - Sir!

1369
01:42:43,332 --> 01:42:44,041
Please, sir.

1370
01:42:44,541 --> 01:42:48,000
Okay. Stop! Stop!

1371
01:42:48,500 --> 01:42:52,000
Hey, quiet!

1372
01:42:54,041 --> 01:42:57,541
Thank you.

1373
01:43:06,916 --> 01:43:10,416
Kundan, be careful.

1374
01:43:50,625 --> 01:43:54,125
Bravo

1375
01:43:57,832 --> 01:44:00,457
Bro, What?

1376
01:44:00,957 --> 01:44:04,750
What did you tell the farmers?

1377
01:44:05,250 --> 01:44:06,707
Nothing.

1378
01:44:07,207 --> 01:44:10,457
I said So you shot the DM, that's alright.

1379
01:44:10,957 --> 01:44:13,291
But this soldier's a poor man.

1380
01:44:13,791 --> 01:44:15,916
His father's a farmer like you.

1381
01:44:16,416 --> 01:44:18,791
If he dies, his mother will curse all of you.

1382
01:44:19,291 --> 01:44:20,500
And, you'll be ruined.

1383
01:44:21,000 --> 01:44:23,332
Your rivers will run dry.

1384
01:44:23,832 --> 01:44:25,457
Then you can keep your lands.

1385
01:44:25,957 --> 01:44:26,457
That's all.

1386
01:44:26,957 --> 01:44:29,166
That scared them, and they let him go.

1387
01:44:29,666 --> 01:44:30,707
How do you come up with such things?

1388
01:44:31,207 --> 01:44:32,332
I'm a Pandit!

1389
01:44:32,832 --> 01:44:36,041
This is how I've been living in Beneras for years.

1390
01:44:36,541 --> 01:44:38,957
You're a rascal. - Top class.

1391
01:44:39,457 --> 01:44:39,875
Yes.

1392
01:44:40,375 --> 01:44:44,250
We will win! - AICP will win!

1393
01:44:44,750 --> 01:44:46,375
Vote for.. - AICP!

1394
01:44:46,875 --> 01:44:48,125
Vote for.. - AICP!

1395
01:44:48,625 --> 01:44:49,375
Vote for.. - AICP! - Hello uncle, aunty.

1396
01:44:49,875 --> 01:44:52,250
Vote for.. - AICP! - We're here.

1397
01:44:52,750 --> 01:44:56,250
Come along, sister-in-law

1398
01:45:00,332 --> 01:45:00,916
Stop hitting us.

1399
01:45:01,416 --> 01:45:02,832
Have you lost your mind? Why are you hurling slippers at us.

1400
01:45:03,332 --> 01:45:05,250
Are you guys mad? - Don't set foot in here.

1401
01:45:05,750 --> 01:45:06,707
Get lost.

1402
01:45:07,207 --> 01:45:08,832
We just want to talk.

1403
01:45:09,332 --> 01:45:10,416
We're against this government as well.

1404
01:45:10,916 --> 01:45:11,707
We've formed a new party.

1405
01:45:12,207 --> 01:45:14,582
New or old, you're just a bunch of thieves.

1406
01:45:15,082 --> 01:45:17,082
After the elections, no one will even take a peek here.

1407
01:45:17,582 --> 01:45:18,832
I'll be damned if anyone does.

1408
01:45:19,332 --> 01:45:20,250
We just want to help.

1409
01:45:20,750 --> 01:45:24,500
Mother Teresa. We don't want your help. Get out!

1410
01:45:25,000 --> 01:45:26,666
These rascals are here to help.

1411
01:45:27,166 --> 01:45:28,041
Hey! Keep that spade down.

1412
01:45:28,541 --> 01:45:30,166
Pick it up again and I'll beat you to a pulp.

1413
01:45:30,666 --> 01:45:35,832
Better get going, or else I'll start throwing slippers at you.

1414
01:45:36,332 --> 01:45:39,500
And humiliate you to death.

1415
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:42,750
Kundan, where are you going? - Just forget it.

1416
01:45:43,250 --> 01:45:44,916
Hey, what's this? - Hey.

1417
01:45:45,416 --> 01:45:46,541
Don't create a scene.

1418
01:45:47,041 --> 01:45:50,000
Or else I'll beat you.

1419
01:45:50,500 --> 01:45:54,707
You're such pathetic rascals, to show this anger so late.

1420
01:45:55,207 --> 01:45:57,166
Thirty years ago, if your father had shown the same anger..

1421
01:45:57,666 --> 01:46:01,041
..you wouldn't have been living in this shit.

1422
01:46:01,541 --> 01:46:04,666
Yes, we're here to ask for your vote.

1423
01:46:05,166 --> 01:46:06,957
So what's wrong in that?

1424
01:46:07,457 --> 01:46:10,041
You've been giving your vote for the last 60 years, aren't you?

1425
01:46:10,541 --> 01:46:13,041
So, this time give your vote to us.

1426
01:46:13,541 --> 01:46:14,791
What's going to happen?

1427
01:46:15,291 --> 01:46:17,916
At the most, you'll be the fool.

1428
01:46:18,416 --> 01:46:22,125
But, that you still are.

1429
01:46:22,625 --> 01:46:24,207
So, shall we leave..

1430
01:46:24,707 --> 01:46:28,207
..or pick up the shovel and help you.

1431
01:46:41,082 --> 01:46:42,625
The AICP members...

1432
01:46:43,125 --> 01:46:46,457
'The media had made us heroes, so did fate.'

1433
01:46:46,957 --> 01:46:48,250
'This is when I realised..'

1434
01:46:48,750 --> 01:46:50,791
'..there's a huge dearth of leaders in our country.'

1435
01:46:51,291 --> 01:46:53,582
'If they were listening to a uncouth like me..'

1436
01:46:54,082 --> 01:46:55,416
'..they would listen to anyone.'

1437
01:46:55,916 --> 01:46:58,416
'But, I wasn't concerned about the country.'

1438
01:46:58,916 --> 01:47:01,666
'All I cared about was me.'

1439
01:47:02,166 --> 01:47:05,625
'I was thinking, if I can impress these AICP kids..'

1440
01:47:06,125 --> 01:47:07,666
'..then someday, she'll see the light as well.'

1441
01:47:08,166 --> 01:47:10,250
'But, Zoya didn't like me one bit.'

1442
01:47:10,750 --> 01:47:12,082
'I was walking ahead.'

1443
01:47:12,582 --> 01:47:14,541
'I was getting on her nerves.'

1444
01:47:15,041 --> 01:47:16,082
'But, I didn't realise..'

1445
01:47:16,582 --> 01:47:18,375
'..when my success posed a threat to the government.'

1446
01:47:18,875 --> 01:47:21,791
AICP party members nearly escaped from being badly beaten.

1447
01:47:22,291 --> 01:47:25,082
After the Bhatta Parsol incident, this is another victory..

1448
01:47:25,582 --> 01:47:28,500
..for AICP's youth party in Sheelampur area.

1449
01:47:29,000 --> 01:47:31,416
There's less than a month for the elections.

1450
01:47:31,916 --> 01:47:33,291
They're gaining good mileage.

1451
01:47:33,791 --> 01:47:36,291
They'll certainly win 10-12 seats.

1452
01:47:36,791 --> 01:47:38,832
Put up tents all around this place.

1453
01:47:39,332 --> 01:47:41,041
And, all the tents..

1454
01:47:41,541 --> 01:47:43,541
You don't need to put up the tent, pal.

1455
01:47:44,041 --> 01:47:44,916
Work on your speech.

1456
01:47:45,416 --> 01:47:47,332
People only listen to you.

1457
01:47:47,832 --> 01:47:51,332
I will speak.

1458
01:47:55,457 --> 01:47:57,875
What's going on here?

1459
01:47:58,375 --> 01:47:59,041
Get out!

1460
01:47:59,541 --> 01:48:00,791
Take these out. - Why?

1461
01:48:01,291 --> 01:48:04,166
We've official permission. - What permission?

1462
01:48:04,666 --> 01:48:05,916
We're the official.

1463
01:48:06,416 --> 01:48:07,875
You don't have our permission.

1464
01:48:08,375 --> 01:48:09,291
They can't just take it off? - Take these out!

1465
01:48:09,791 --> 01:48:12,582
Look, sir, we.. - Has the government stooped so low?

1466
01:48:13,082 --> 01:48:14,750
Don't touch me, or I'll have to take action.

1467
01:48:15,250 --> 01:48:16,500
Go ahead. Take action! - Zoya.

1468
01:48:17,000 --> 01:48:17,916
Beat us! - Zoya.

1469
01:48:18,416 --> 01:48:20,207
Stop, Zoya. - Move back.

1470
01:48:20,707 --> 01:48:21,791
Sir, please try to understand.

1471
01:48:22,291 --> 01:48:24,500
Sir! Sir! Sir!

1472
01:48:25,000 --> 01:48:28,125
You shouldn't raise your hand on women!

1473
01:48:28,625 --> 01:48:30,791
Did you record that? - Yes.

1474
01:48:31,291 --> 01:48:35,207
Do you want me to upload it?

1475
01:48:35,707 --> 01:48:37,832
That's okay. I'll handle it.

1476
01:48:38,332 --> 01:48:39,541
And, sir.

1477
01:48:40,041 --> 01:48:42,250
Even if we win 2 seats in the elections..

1478
01:48:42,750 --> 01:48:46,207
..you'll definitely get transferred.

1479
01:48:46,707 --> 01:48:49,582
Sir. We get orders too.

1480
01:48:50,082 --> 01:48:53,375
We've no personal enmity with you.

1481
01:48:53,875 --> 01:48:57,332
Sorry.

1482
01:48:57,832 --> 01:49:00,000
Whose orders?

1483
01:49:00,500 --> 01:49:03,125
Vinod Gupta.

1484
01:49:03,625 --> 01:49:05,707
We could've talked to the inspector calmly.

1485
01:49:06,207 --> 01:49:07,541
Only 10 more days of campaning.

1486
01:49:08,041 --> 01:49:11,500
It's not a good idea to get in a tiff with the police.

1487
01:49:12,000 --> 01:49:12,957
Come on, dear. Go home.

1488
01:49:13,457 --> 01:49:16,832
Study. Exams are close.

1489
01:49:17,332 --> 01:49:20,832
Him. He'll be the leader of the masses!

1490
01:49:26,500 --> 01:49:30,041
Don't try to catch the snake by the hood, Gupta..

1491
01:49:30,541 --> 01:49:34,207
..if it stings, you'll be in deep trouble.

1492
01:49:34,707 --> 01:49:36,000
Let's go.

1493
01:49:36,500 --> 01:49:37,750
Where are you going, Mr. Gupta?

1494
01:49:38,250 --> 01:49:40,332
Let me tell you a joke.

1495
01:49:40,832 --> 01:49:43,541
Everything he does is right, and what I do is wrong.

1496
01:49:44,041 --> 01:49:45,541
He's the undisputed leader of the party.

1497
01:49:46,041 --> 01:49:47,332
We'll need his permission for everything, right?

1498
01:49:47,832 --> 01:49:51,625
He'll give the speech. Help us win the elections!

1499
01:49:52,125 --> 01:49:54,500
Let me congratulate you Kundan!

1500
01:49:55,000 --> 01:49:56,707
You must be really happy, you dog!

1501
01:49:57,207 --> 01:49:58,457
What else do you need?

1502
01:49:58,957 --> 01:50:01,207
Now, you've the position of the man you killed.

1503
01:50:01,707 --> 01:50:03,832
And, now you want his girlfriend to sleep with, right?

1504
01:50:04,332 --> 01:50:05,750
What else do you want?

1505
01:50:06,250 --> 01:50:08,500
I never cried over Jasjeet's death.

1506
01:50:09,000 --> 01:50:12,707
I wanted to dedicate my life to fulfil his last dream.

1507
01:50:13,207 --> 01:50:15,041
That's all.

1508
01:50:15,541 --> 01:50:17,582
But, you can snatch that too.

1509
01:50:18,082 --> 01:50:23,291
Yes! He killed Jasjeet. And you're cheering him!

1510
01:50:23,791 --> 01:50:25,666
Anant Srivastav! This man killed him!

1511
01:50:26,166 --> 01:50:30,457
Go ahead, lick him!

1512
01:50:30,957 --> 01:50:32,416
You didn't just lose Jasjeet..

1513
01:50:32,916 --> 01:50:35,000
..or, you didn't lose just a friend.

1514
01:50:35,500 --> 01:50:36,582
I lost my brother.

1515
01:50:37,082 --> 01:50:39,582
That means I get to kill him first.

1516
01:50:40,082 --> 01:50:41,957
This man is our last hope.

1517
01:50:42,457 --> 01:50:43,457
You can choose power, politics, position..

1518
01:50:43,957 --> 01:50:45,541
..over your brother's death.

1519
01:50:46,041 --> 01:50:48,957
Can you all forget the man that formed this party?

1520
01:50:49,457 --> 01:50:51,791
His agenda wasn't just winning the elections.

1521
01:50:52,291 --> 01:50:54,707
He had principles, he believed him.

1522
01:50:55,207 --> 01:51:00,707
And he died because of this man.

1523
01:51:01,207 --> 01:51:03,832
Honestly son, my son passed because of you.

1524
01:51:04,332 --> 01:51:05,582
You made it possible.

1525
01:51:06,082 --> 01:51:09,582
Police? - Why are they here?

1526
01:51:13,582 --> 01:51:16,750
Come on, son. Apoligise.

1527
01:51:17,250 --> 01:51:20,125
Apologise, or we'll break your bones.

1528
01:51:20,625 --> 01:51:23,375
Mr. Gupta. I never even apologised to my father..

1529
01:51:23,875 --> 01:51:25,707
..when I made a mistake.

1530
01:51:26,207 --> 01:51:31,416
And now, it's not my mistake, neither are you my father.

1531
01:51:31,916 --> 01:51:34,332
Beat him!

1532
01:51:34,832 --> 01:51:37,000
Stop. - Don't beat him.

1533
01:51:37,500 --> 01:51:39,791
Kundan, let him go.

1534
01:51:40,291 --> 01:51:45,250
Let Kundan go.

1535
01:51:45,750 --> 01:51:47,791
What are you thinking?

1536
01:51:48,291 --> 01:51:50,332
Say it

1537
01:51:50,832 --> 01:51:55,791
Thankfully Zoya said everything.

1538
01:51:56,291 --> 01:52:00,457
I couldn't have.

1539
01:52:00,957 --> 01:52:04,457
I should leave.

1540
01:52:07,082 --> 01:52:08,957
Look.

1541
01:52:09,457 --> 01:52:12,250
There are two types of leaders.

1542
01:52:12,750 --> 01:52:16,791
One, that likes to dissolve the government.

1543
01:52:17,291 --> 01:52:21,750
And the other, who like to make a government.

1544
01:52:22,250 --> 01:52:26,166
I knew Jasjeet better than these two women!

1545
01:52:26,666 --> 01:52:29,832
He was the second type.

1546
01:52:30,332 --> 01:52:31,791
Stay.

1547
01:52:32,291 --> 01:52:35,791
But, this time you've got to do something.

1548
01:52:42,041 --> 01:52:44,957
Madam. That's a really nice gift for Kapil.

1549
01:52:45,457 --> 01:52:47,166
But, think Gupta.

1550
01:52:47,666 --> 01:52:50,375
If he bites us only for his ego.

1551
01:52:50,875 --> 01:52:53,041
Pees over the 2015 budget.

1552
01:52:53,541 --> 01:52:59,332
And bites every minister and official?

1553
01:52:59,832 --> 01:53:01,457
Sorry, madam. It was a mistake.

1554
01:53:01,957 --> 01:53:04,250
You've turned this into a chaos..

1555
01:53:04,750 --> 01:53:06,375
..and say it's a mistake.

1556
01:53:06,875 --> 01:53:08,291
Don't worry, I'll handle it.

1557
01:53:08,791 --> 01:53:09,875
The next five years..

1558
01:53:10,375 --> 01:53:12,125
..you will be handling that dog, Gupta.

1559
01:53:12,625 --> 01:53:14,457
You've enjoyed too many privileges for too long.

1560
01:53:14,957 --> 01:53:17,375
Santram, take me to St. George's Hospital.

1561
01:53:17,875 --> 01:53:21,500
Will you tell me what this is all about?

1562
01:53:22,000 --> 01:53:23,082
Start from the very beginning.

1563
01:53:23,582 --> 01:53:25,582
It's the first time police has entered JNU Campus.

1564
01:53:26,082 --> 01:53:26,500
And, your reaction?

1565
01:53:27,000 --> 01:53:28,291
Who said it's the first time? It's happened before.

1566
01:53:28,791 --> 01:53:29,750
Madam, yours is a political party.

1567
01:53:30,250 --> 01:53:31,332
So, how can you operate from a government institute.

1568
01:53:31,832 --> 01:53:32,582
The administration doesn't have a problem..

1569
01:53:33,082 --> 01:53:33,666
..so, why do you?

1570
01:53:34,166 --> 01:53:35,916
Ms. Zoya, what was the reason behind the scuffle.

1571
01:53:36,416 --> 01:53:38,916
Look. We are the victims here.

1572
01:53:39,416 --> 01:53:40,582
My friends are hurt.

1573
01:53:41,082 --> 01:53:43,791
Many have suffered broken bones!

1574
01:53:44,291 --> 01:53:46,416
Why don't you go to Mr. Gupta's office?

1575
01:53:46,916 --> 01:53:48,916
Why not raise this question outside the Parliament?

1576
01:53:49,416 --> 01:53:52,416
We'll give a reply. But, not like this.

1577
01:53:52,916 --> 01:53:53,832
Not when we're beaten.

1578
01:53:54,332 --> 01:53:55,791
We'll do it on a stage.

1579
01:53:56,291 --> 01:53:59,416
And, on the top of our voice.

1580
01:53:59,916 --> 01:54:02,791
We're organizing a rally. You're all invited.

1581
01:54:03,291 --> 01:54:06,791
Thank you. - Ma'am, please..

1582
01:54:17,750 --> 01:54:21,582
May I have a word with you, Zoya?

1583
01:54:22,082 --> 01:54:26,832
Alone?

1584
01:54:27,332 --> 01:54:30,125
Sad about Jasjeet.

1585
01:54:30,625 --> 01:54:32,125
I often heard about him.

1586
01:54:32,625 --> 01:54:36,000
I met him once. At the ISC Conference.

1587
01:54:36,500 --> 01:54:39,707
He was an intelligent boy. - He did tell me.

1588
01:54:40,207 --> 01:54:44,416
He said you're quite intelligent as well.

1589
01:54:44,916 --> 01:54:47,957
So, how can you be so stupid?

1590
01:54:48,457 --> 01:54:49,166
She has come.

1591
01:54:49,666 --> 01:54:53,832
Excuse me!

1592
01:54:54,332 --> 01:54:57,832
Hey, the CM's here.

1593
01:55:02,500 --> 01:55:03,957
Name your price for giving us Kundan.

1594
01:55:04,457 --> 01:55:07,457
Ask him to join our party.

1595
01:55:07,957 --> 01:55:11,957
I'm telling you because you're close to him.

1596
01:55:12,457 --> 01:55:14,500
The party is Jasjeet's.

1597
01:55:15,000 --> 01:55:15,750
Kundan's the leader.

1598
01:55:16,250 --> 01:55:19,582
And, what about you? Nothing.

1599
01:55:20,082 --> 01:55:21,625
The reason your party made it this far..

1600
01:55:22,125 --> 01:55:24,791
..was only because of Kundan.

1601
01:55:25,291 --> 01:55:29,166
Are you done?

1602
01:55:29,666 --> 01:55:34,166
Thank you.

1603
01:55:34,666 --> 01:55:37,375
Why did you feel hurt?

1604
01:55:37,875 --> 01:55:40,625
Did I say something wrong?

1605
01:55:41,125 --> 01:55:45,457
Zoya, Jasjeet would've been really sad..

1606
01:55:45,957 --> 01:55:48,832
..to see you in this condition.

1607
01:55:49,332 --> 01:55:51,125
Come on in.

1608
01:55:51,625 --> 01:55:55,125
Let's talk.

1609
01:56:00,957 --> 01:56:02,125
Just think about it, Zoya.

1610
01:56:02,625 --> 01:56:04,332
Think. No pressure.

1611
01:56:04,832 --> 01:56:07,207
You know my house. Office too.

1612
01:56:07,707 --> 01:56:09,582
My secretary will be in touch with you.

1613
01:56:10,082 --> 01:56:13,582
Let me know if you change your mood.

1614
01:56:35,041 --> 01:56:38,000
Everyone likes you, Kundan.

1615
01:56:38,500 --> 01:56:40,625
You're their hero.

1616
01:56:41,125 --> 01:56:44,207
Stay back.

1617
01:56:44,707 --> 01:56:48,207
They all need you.

1618
01:56:59,250 --> 01:57:06,166
I don't want anything from you.

1619
01:57:06,666 --> 01:57:13,416
No consolation, or faith.

1620
01:57:13,916 --> 01:57:20,750
No applauds, or sympathy.

1621
01:57:21,250 --> 01:57:27,916
No dreams, no comfort.

1622
01:57:28,416 --> 01:57:28,875
Sorry!

1623
01:57:29,375 --> 01:57:35,625
Don't look at me like this.

1624
01:57:36,125 --> 01:57:42,541
Don't look at me like this.

1625
01:57:43,041 --> 01:57:47,957
Where's your husband? - He's dead.

1626
01:57:48,457 --> 01:57:51,957
Dead? There he is.

1627
01:58:00,125 --> 01:58:12,666
I am the song...you don't want to listen.

1628
01:58:13,166 --> 01:58:20,125
The first leaf...fallen in Autumn.

1629
01:58:20,625 --> 01:58:27,957
A drop of tear...in the desert.

1630
01:58:28,457 --> 01:58:35,041
I'm the moment that's passed.

1631
01:58:35,541 --> 01:58:38,291
No way I can come back.

1632
01:58:38,791 --> 01:58:43,375
That's true.

1633
01:58:43,875 --> 01:58:57,582
Don't look at me...like you never saw me before.

1634
01:58:58,082 --> 01:59:05,457
Like you never saw me before.

1635
01:59:05,957 --> 01:59:10,082
Don't look at me..

1636
01:59:10,582 --> 01:59:12,500
Load these as well. - No!

1637
01:59:13,000 --> 01:59:14,291
Who is calling now?

1638
01:59:14,791 --> 01:59:16,666
Kundan, answer the phone.

1639
01:59:17,166 --> 01:59:18,457
Talk to them once.

1640
01:59:18,957 --> 01:59:20,000
Anant.

1641
01:59:20,500 --> 01:59:22,207
Kundan and I are taking a rickshaw.

1642
01:59:22,707 --> 01:59:24,332
You guys take the bus. - Okay.

1643
01:59:24,832 --> 01:59:26,957
Hurry up everyone. If you're finished then sit in your places.

1644
01:59:27,457 --> 01:59:30,957
Take him along.

1645
02:00:36,457 --> 02:00:41,250
These are Jasjeet's clothes.

1646
02:00:41,750 --> 02:00:45,541
This Nehru jacket looked really nice on him.

1647
02:00:46,041 --> 02:00:50,082
I couldn't see him make it this far.

1648
02:00:50,582 --> 02:00:53,500
So, why not you.

1649
02:00:54,000 --> 02:00:56,541
I couldn't help him prepare for the battle.

1650
02:00:57,041 --> 02:01:00,541
So, why not you.

1651
02:01:03,000 --> 02:01:05,666
The first day I saw you in Delhi..

1652
02:01:06,166 --> 02:01:09,875
..I wanted to hug you.

1653
02:01:10,375 --> 02:01:12,957
And ask...won't you do anything..

1654
02:01:13,457 --> 02:01:20,625
..for the same Zoya you slit your wrist.

1655
02:01:21,125 --> 02:01:27,957
The world will spit on me if I love you.

1656
02:01:28,457 --> 02:01:31,957
But look, I'm in love now.

1657
02:01:39,791 --> 02:01:43,291
You're looking nice.

1658
02:01:48,207 --> 02:01:50,582
Go on, Kundan.

1659
02:01:51,082 --> 02:01:54,500
Everyone's waiting for you.

1660
02:01:55,000 --> 02:01:56,416
Kundan, go!

1661
02:01:56,916 --> 02:02:00,416
Kundan, go!

1662
02:02:06,041 --> 02:02:08,541
You're doing everything so well..

1663
02:02:09,041 --> 02:02:12,291
..why did falter here now?

1664
02:02:12,791 --> 02:02:17,541
Zoya, you're trying to prove a Muslim, Hindu again.

1665
02:02:18,041 --> 02:02:19,957
Control yourself.

1666
02:02:20,457 --> 02:02:24,707
No need to love me.

1667
02:02:25,207 --> 02:02:29,416
They're crazy, but you're smart.

1668
02:02:29,916 --> 02:02:35,000
I don't know what you're trying to do..

1669
02:02:35,500 --> 02:02:37,625
..or, where you're asking me to go.

1670
02:02:38,125 --> 02:02:42,666
But, I'll go anywhere you ask me to.

1671
02:02:43,166 --> 02:02:49,707
And I swear, I will win.

1672
02:02:50,207 --> 02:02:53,707
And, if you still say you don't love me..

1673
02:03:05,166 --> 02:03:08,916
..then you can slap me 17 times.

1674
02:03:09,416 --> 02:03:12,250
Otherwise..

1675
02:03:12,750 --> 02:03:16,250
..I will take my 17 kisses.

1676
02:03:46,375 --> 02:03:47,875
'Everything can still be fixed.'

1677
02:03:48,375 --> 02:03:52,250
'You've to keep Kundan until the last day of the campaign.'

1678
02:03:52,750 --> 02:03:55,082
'You just announced a big rally.'

1679
02:03:55,582 --> 02:03:59,082
'Your job is to bring Kundan to that rally.'

1680
02:04:04,082 --> 02:04:05,457
'And according to the situation..'

1681
02:04:05,957 --> 02:04:08,500
'..you might win a few seats.'

1682
02:04:09,000 --> 02:04:12,082
'But, that's possible only when Kundan's with you.'

1683
02:04:12,582 --> 02:04:15,500
'So, that face will help you win.'

1684
02:04:16,000 --> 02:04:19,416
'On the last day of the campaign, finish him.'

1685
02:04:19,916 --> 02:04:21,582
'The police will pose no threat.'

1686
02:04:22,082 --> 02:04:25,582
'An small explosion can scatter such gatherings.'

1687
02:04:33,082 --> 02:04:36,582
'Doesn't take long to start a pandemonium.'

1688
02:05:06,416 --> 02:05:09,916
Hello madam, look.

1689
02:05:25,250 --> 02:05:28,750
'Doesn't take long to shoot a bullet in such places.'

1690
02:05:40,416 --> 02:05:42,707
'And what's left behind? Seats.'

1691
02:05:43,207 --> 02:05:45,000
'You just need to extend your support..'

1692
02:05:45,500 --> 02:05:46,832
'..to our party, after Kundan's dead.'

1693
02:05:47,332 --> 02:05:48,832
'Who'll be the leader of your party..'

1694
02:05:49,332 --> 02:05:53,082
'..of course, only you will decide.'

1695
02:05:53,582 --> 02:05:57,541
'That will take care of your job, and ours too.'

1696
02:05:58,041 --> 02:06:01,541
'Scores settled.'

1697
02:06:13,500 --> 02:06:15,625
How can they stoop that low?

1698
02:06:16,125 --> 02:06:18,457
Some people believe that Kundan's been shot..

1699
02:06:18,957 --> 02:06:22,916
..while others believe he's been badly beaten up.

1700
02:06:23,416 --> 02:06:26,916
Only time will tell us the truth.

1701
02:06:39,957 --> 02:06:43,457
Come. Come.

1702
02:06:53,291 --> 02:06:55,582
Calm down! Please calm down!

1703
02:06:56,082 --> 02:07:00,582
You all want to know..

1704
02:07:01,082 --> 02:07:07,416
..whether we're involved in the India Gate incident?

1705
02:07:07,916 --> 02:07:11,500
Well, the answer's right before you.

1706
02:07:12,000 --> 02:07:17,666
Can we hurt those we want to make an alliance with?

1707
02:07:18,166 --> 02:07:22,500
Well, no leader can be that stupid.

1708
02:07:23,000 --> 02:07:23,875
Come, Zoya.

1709
02:07:24,375 --> 02:07:27,875
Come, share the big news.

1710
02:07:43,875 --> 02:07:49,291
The big news isn't what the CM just announced.

1711
02:07:49,791 --> 02:07:51,500
The big news is that..

1712
02:07:52,000 --> 02:07:55,500
..she's involved in the India Gate incident that occurred today.

1713
02:08:01,041 --> 02:08:04,541
And, me too.

1714
02:08:30,875 --> 02:08:33,416
Her reasons obvious.

1715
02:08:33,916 --> 02:08:39,500
And, it'll take all night to know mine.

1716
02:08:40,000 --> 02:08:43,750
By the way, I'm ready to go myself.

1717
02:08:44,250 --> 02:08:46,582
You can levy an inquiry on her.

1718
02:08:47,082 --> 02:08:50,250
And in 10-15 years, when it's proven..

1719
02:08:50,750 --> 02:08:54,750
..you can send her to me.

1720
02:08:55,250 --> 02:08:58,750
Now the scores are settled.

1721
02:09:14,166 --> 02:09:17,707
You're lying, right?

1722
02:09:18,207 --> 02:09:19,541
How could Kundan go to that rally?

1723
02:09:20,041 --> 02:09:21,500
Because, I had informed him in the morning..

1724
02:09:22,000 --> 02:09:25,500
..that, there's going to be an uproar.

1725
02:09:34,582 --> 02:09:38,082
Can you take me there?

1726
02:09:50,875 --> 02:09:52,041
Move back!

1727
02:09:52,541 --> 02:09:55,082
You'll die, pal.

1728
02:09:55,582 --> 02:09:59,082
Why endure all that..

1729
02:10:03,375 --> 02:10:06,875
Die.

1730
02:10:08,916 --> 02:10:10,916
Is your party under anyone's pressure?

1731
02:10:11,416 --> 02:10:14,916
Ms. Zoya, answer us.

1732
02:10:22,166 --> 02:10:24,375
He's yours.

1733
02:10:24,875 --> 02:10:27,541
My Kundan never spat blood.

1734
02:10:28,041 --> 02:10:31,541
He's yours.

1735
02:10:55,125 --> 02:10:56,625
'That's it.'

1736
02:10:57,125 --> 02:10:59,500
'That was my story.'

1737
02:11:00,000 --> 02:11:01,666
'A girl sitting besides me.'

1738
02:11:02,166 --> 02:11:06,375
'Few doctors, who were hoping to save me.'

1739
02:11:06,875 --> 02:11:10,375
'A friend, who was insane.'

1740
02:11:17,041 --> 02:11:22,541
'Another girl, who dedicated her life to me.'

1741
02:11:23,041 --> 02:11:27,582
'My mom, dad, and the lanes of Beneras.'

1742
02:11:28,082 --> 02:11:31,041
'And my body, that had left me.'

1743
02:11:31,541 --> 02:11:34,791
'And my chest, where the fire was still raging.'

1744
02:11:35,291 --> 02:11:37,416
'I could've got up, but for whom?'

1745
02:11:37,916 --> 02:11:39,832
'I could've screamed, but for whom?'

1746
02:11:40,332 --> 02:11:43,082
'My love, Zoya, Beneras, Bindiya, Murari..'

1747
02:11:43,582 --> 02:11:45,625
'..they were all slipping away.'

1748
02:11:46,125 --> 02:11:48,541
'But, why would I have stayed back for?'

1749
02:11:49,041 --> 02:11:53,625
'The fire inside me could've kept me alive, or kill me.'

1750
02:11:54,125 --> 02:11:55,291
'But, why get up now.'

1751
02:11:55,791 --> 02:11:57,541
'Who's got the courage to fall in love again..'

1752
02:11:58,041 --> 02:11:59,625
'..suffer a heart-break.'

1753
02:12:00,125 --> 02:12:02,916
'Somebody stop me.'

1754
02:12:03,416 --> 02:12:06,250
'This girl besides me with the blank stare..'

1755
02:12:06,750 --> 02:12:10,082
'..I can still get up for her.'

1756
02:12:10,582 --> 02:12:14,041
'But no. I'm not in the mood anymore.'

1757
02:12:14,541 --> 02:12:18,250
'It's better to close my eyes. To get into deep slumber.'
