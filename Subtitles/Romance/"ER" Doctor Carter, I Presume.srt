1
00:00:07,023 --> 00:00:07,853
<i>Previously on</i> ER...

2
00:00:08,091 --> 00:00:11,583
The doctor said I may have
been HIV-positive...

3
00:00:11,828 --> 00:00:13,659
...for as long as 10 years.

4
00:00:13,897 --> 00:00:15,296
You turned down chief?

5
00:00:15,532 --> 00:00:16,430
Yes, I did.

6
00:00:16,666 --> 00:00:17,530
Al's got AIDS.

7
00:00:17,734 --> 00:00:19,793
We were careful,
but not that careful.

8
00:00:57,006 --> 00:01:00,100
17-year-old male. Multiple GSWs
to the chest and abdomen.

9
00:01:00,376 --> 00:01:02,310
Pulse 140 and thready. BP's 80.

10
00:01:02,579 --> 00:01:04,945
Stop squirming.
This fool look familiar?

11
00:01:05,181 --> 00:01:06,375
He got shot before.

12
00:01:06,616 --> 00:01:09,141
- It hurts!
- I hope so. Two times in six months.

13
00:01:09,385 --> 00:01:12,081
You got yourself a real slow
learning curve going.

14
00:01:29,072 --> 00:01:30,437
Unit 68's on the way.

15
00:01:30,707 --> 00:01:34,108
Drunk dove off the balcony of the
Motor Lodge, looking for the pool.

16
00:01:34,377 --> 00:01:36,277
- Did he find it?
- Nope.

17
00:01:38,348 --> 00:01:40,282
Dr. Carter, I presume.

18
00:01:40,550 --> 00:01:41,482
Carter, what's up?

19
00:01:41,751 --> 00:01:46,120
- Surgical interns meet down here?
- Yes. Your lemmings are over here.

20
00:01:46,356 --> 00:01:48,790
- Jerry, that lead poisoning in?
- Trauma 2.

21
00:01:49,025 --> 00:01:51,926
Are you gonna make it to
the Fourth of July picnic today?

22
00:01:52,162 --> 00:01:56,155
- My bat and glove are in my car.
- Park the guy with TB.

23
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:57,627
Hey, Dr. Lewis.

24
00:01:57,834 --> 00:01:59,426
Carter, your first day?

25
00:01:59,669 --> 00:02:02,832
If you can't cut it in Surgery,
there's Family Medicine.

26
00:02:03,106 --> 00:02:05,336
- Or Gerontology.
- Or Psychiatry.

27
00:02:05,608 --> 00:02:07,098
They can't throw you out.

28
00:02:07,377 --> 00:02:09,845
They make you so miserable,
you beg to quit.

29
00:02:10,113 --> 00:02:11,273
Susan, we need you!

30
00:02:11,514 --> 00:02:13,311
It's only a year. You'll make it.

31
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:16,144
- Guess I had better go join the group.
- Good luck.

32
00:02:16,386 --> 00:02:18,047
Try not to kill anyone.

33
00:02:18,288 --> 00:02:19,255
Surgical interns?

34
00:02:19,489 --> 00:02:22,049
John, Dale Edson.
Harvard Med. We met last year.

35
00:02:22,292 --> 00:02:23,691
- How you been?
- Great.

36
00:02:23,927 --> 00:02:27,226
Just spent six weeks down at Hopkins
on a Thoracic elective.

37
00:02:27,463 --> 00:02:29,192
Resident was a Nazi.

38
00:02:29,432 --> 00:02:32,128
But they let me scrub in
on 20 valve replacements.

39
00:02:32,335 --> 00:02:33,893
This is Julie Dixon. Duke.

40
00:02:34,137 --> 00:02:36,697
This is Leung Joo Hua.
UC San Francisco.

41
00:02:36,973 --> 00:02:38,702
And Dennis Gant. Ole Miss.

42
00:02:38,975 --> 00:02:40,943
LSU, actually.
They let us wear scrubs?

43
00:02:41,211 --> 00:02:43,304
Yeah. It's pretty
informal around here.

44
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:45,878
John went to school here.
He'll show us around.

45
00:02:46,115 --> 00:02:49,846
- I wanna know, where's the coffee?
- Blue Team surgical interns.

46
00:02:50,086 --> 00:02:53,385
I'm Dr. Melvoin. Today's
the last day of my internship...

47
00:02:53,623 --> 00:02:55,250
...and the first day of yours.

48
00:02:55,491 --> 00:02:58,949
Which means, in the great game
of medical education tag, you're it.

49
00:02:59,195 --> 00:03:02,562
House staff guidelines.
This lists conferences and clinics...

50
00:03:02,799 --> 00:03:04,528
...you are required to attend.

51
00:03:04,734 --> 00:03:07,794
Miss one, and your evaluation
will be degraded.

52
00:03:08,037 --> 00:03:12,440
Vascular conference, Monday, 4 to 5.
Pathology, Monday, 5 to 7.

53
00:03:12,675 --> 00:03:17,169
Radiology, Tuesday at 5.
M & M's, Wednesday, 7 a.m.

54
00:03:17,447 --> 00:03:20,382
Intern reports,
Monday, Thursday, Friday...

55
00:03:20,617 --> 00:03:22,414
...at 7 a.m.

56
00:03:22,652 --> 00:03:27,021
Vascular Journal Club, Tuesday at 7.
Chairman's Conference, Friday, 7 a.m.

57
00:03:27,257 --> 00:03:29,623
The conference
and intern report conflict?

58
00:03:29,859 --> 00:03:34,626
Yep. You're on five days a week,
from 5 a.m. Till you finish at 7 p.m.

59
00:03:34,864 --> 00:03:37,765
You're on call every
third weekend and third night.

60
00:03:37,967 --> 00:03:41,698
Every three days, you're here
from 5 a.m. Till 7 p.m. The next day.

61
00:03:41,938 --> 00:03:44,133
- When do we get to sleep?
- You don't.

62
00:03:44,407 --> 00:03:45,271
You are wedges.

63
00:03:45,541 --> 00:03:48,977
The wedge is the most primitive tool
known to man. That is you.

64
00:03:49,245 --> 00:03:52,806
You think you know what you're doing?
Believe me, you don't.

65
00:03:53,316 --> 00:03:56,649
Breakfast with your senior
surgical resident, Dr. Benton...

66
00:03:56,886 --> 00:03:59,047
...will begin in 15 minutes.

67
00:03:59,289 --> 00:04:01,553
Dr. Benton is an intern's
worst nightmare.

68
00:04:01,858 --> 00:04:04,520
He's smarter than you.
He never eats, never sleeps.

69
00:04:04,761 --> 00:04:08,026
And he reads every medical journal,
no matter how obscure.

70
00:04:08,264 --> 00:04:12,997
He is the Antichrist, Beelzebub,
Lucifer, a devourer of wedges.

71
00:04:13,202 --> 00:04:17,138
You'll go to sleep at night wishing
pestilence on his unborn children.

72
00:04:17,407 --> 00:04:20,808
And you will wake up every morning
praying for his approval.

73
00:04:21,044 --> 00:04:22,807
You won't get it.

74
00:04:27,150 --> 00:04:29,618
Welcome to hell, ladies and gentlemen.

75
00:04:30,887 --> 00:04:33,515
Benton. He can't be that bad.

76
00:04:33,756 --> 00:04:35,053
Can he?

77
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:57,833
Peter.

78
00:06:01,944 --> 00:06:04,174
I left a message.
You never called back.

79
00:06:04,414 --> 00:06:05,881
I was in surgery.

80
00:06:09,252 --> 00:06:10,913
I tested positive.

81
00:06:16,325 --> 00:06:18,156
Did you get your results back?

82
00:06:22,732 --> 00:06:24,131
No, I...

83
00:06:28,838 --> 00:06:29,862
Sometime today.

84
00:06:32,942 --> 00:06:35,376
I'll have to talk to
Mark Greene about it.

85
00:06:41,517 --> 00:06:43,417
I thought you'd wanna know.

86
00:06:57,900 --> 00:06:59,197
I'm sorry.

87
00:07:21,023 --> 00:07:23,958
There you go! Now you're
getting the hang of it.

88
00:07:26,963 --> 00:07:29,488
Remind me again
why we're doing this.

89
00:07:29,732 --> 00:07:30,630
It's fun.

90
00:07:30,833 --> 00:07:32,824
Oh, it's fun. Right. I forgot.

91
00:07:33,069 --> 00:07:34,832
All right. 10-1. Here we go.

92
00:07:36,706 --> 00:07:38,298
- How was that date?
- Awful.

93
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:46,077
You're supposed to use your hands.

94
00:07:51,721 --> 00:07:53,450
Did you call Alicia?

95
00:07:54,524 --> 00:07:58,085
Aerobics instructor?
What are we supposed to talk about?

96
00:07:58,327 --> 00:07:59,954
She's an aerobics instructor!

97
00:08:00,196 --> 00:08:02,164
Don't you wanna talk before sex?

98
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:04,257
Not really. No.

99
00:08:04,467 --> 00:08:06,059
Shared experiences...

100
00:08:06,302 --> 00:08:07,530
...common interests?

101
00:08:07,770 --> 00:08:09,294
You suggest you and I date?

102
00:08:10,373 --> 00:08:13,308
I'm just looking for
a little more than that...

103
00:08:13,643 --> 00:08:14,735
...in a relationship.

104
00:08:15,011 --> 00:08:18,811
A relationship? You're 32
years old. Have some fun!

105
00:08:19,048 --> 00:08:20,982
Dixon, Charcot's triad?

106
00:08:22,685 --> 00:08:25,017
Hypercoagulability, stasis...

107
00:08:25,254 --> 00:08:26,846
Pain, fever, jaundice.

108
00:08:27,089 --> 00:08:29,250
Gant, the ducts of Luschka?

109
00:08:30,159 --> 00:08:33,754
They drain bile and don't communicate
with the gallbladder lumen.

110
00:08:34,197 --> 00:08:36,631
An intern who wasn't
asleep during med school.

111
00:08:37,833 --> 00:08:41,166
Edson, this morning's patient is
jaundiced but no cholangiolitis.

112
00:08:41,404 --> 00:08:45,204
Should we perform the surgery
open or laparoscopically?

113
00:08:45,474 --> 00:08:49,843
- Open. There may be multiple stones.
- I'm going in laparoscopically.

114
00:08:50,079 --> 00:08:52,513
Did you get an ERCP?

115
00:08:56,919 --> 00:08:59,752
Okay, Edson. You scrub in.

116
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:02,189
Don't you wanna ask me something?

117
00:09:02,425 --> 00:09:04,893
Dixon, Leung, you guys cover the ward.

118
00:09:05,127 --> 00:09:06,992
Gant, take the SICU.

119
00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:08,197
The Surgical ICU?

120
00:09:08,431 --> 00:09:10,956
Nurses won't let you
kill anybody. Questions?

121
00:09:11,167 --> 00:09:12,498
Dr. Benton?

122
00:09:13,669 --> 00:09:15,830
Help with the wards and cover the ER.

123
00:09:16,239 --> 00:09:17,035
The ER?

124
00:09:17,306 --> 00:09:20,275
Lastly, we need to discuss
rotation for the night shift.

125
00:09:20,543 --> 00:09:22,101
Dr. Benton, I was hoping...

126
00:09:22,378 --> 00:09:26,542
Carter, thank you for volunteering.
Take the first shift starting tonight.

127
00:09:26,782 --> 00:09:29,376
I'll post the schedules
in the on-call room, okay?

128
00:09:29,619 --> 00:09:30,643
Tonight?

129
00:09:31,921 --> 00:09:34,287
Surgical Ward. Four minutes.

130
00:09:38,861 --> 00:09:41,421
- Better start looking.
- It's just a rumor.

131
00:09:41,664 --> 00:09:44,792
- They're closing us down.
- Where will the patients go?

132
00:09:45,001 --> 00:09:47,435
It's in the <i>Trib.</i>
The mayor set up a commission.

133
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:48,466
What?

134
00:09:48,704 --> 00:09:51,901
They're squeezing the budget,
so they're shutting us down.

135
00:09:52,174 --> 00:09:55,735
I read that. They said closing
County was one of the options.

136
00:09:56,012 --> 00:09:57,502
- They said that?
- We get fired?

137
00:09:57,780 --> 00:10:01,216
- Nobody's getting fired.
- I just took a second out on my house.

138
00:10:01,484 --> 00:10:03,418
- What's the union say?
- We got a contract.

139
00:10:03,653 --> 00:10:07,020
They've talked about closing us
for years, but we're still here.

140
00:10:07,256 --> 00:10:10,020
- You guys going to the picnic?
- I'm gonna stop by.

141
00:10:10,259 --> 00:10:12,193
Me too. I'll see you all later.

142
00:10:12,428 --> 00:10:15,454
- It was in the <i>Tribune</i>?
<i>- Sun-Times</i> too.

143
00:10:16,065 --> 00:10:17,498
Oh, God.

144
00:10:19,535 --> 00:10:22,299
- Why are you here?
- Benton dumped me back in ER.

145
00:10:22,538 --> 00:10:25,871
My first day as a surgeon,
and he makes me do trauma assessments.

146
00:10:26,142 --> 00:10:28,201
Sounds to me like he trusts you.

147
00:10:28,477 --> 00:10:32,277
- Somebody beep for a Surgical consult?
- LOL in 2. 82 years old.

148
00:10:32,515 --> 00:10:35,177
Rule out bowel obstruction.
Benton on his way?

149
00:10:35,418 --> 00:10:37,886
No. I'm the Surgical consult.

150
00:10:38,688 --> 00:10:40,087
He'll be fine.

151
00:10:40,356 --> 00:10:42,153
God help the poor patients.

152
00:10:42,391 --> 00:10:44,985
Mark, I'm concerned about
lack of communication...

153
00:10:45,227 --> 00:10:47,855
...between Attendings
I noticed last year as chief.

154
00:10:48,097 --> 00:10:52,466
Biweekly meetings would get us
on the same page, improve patient care.

155
00:10:52,668 --> 00:10:55,034
Tuesdays and Thursdays
during lunch works.

156
00:10:55,271 --> 00:10:59,367
It'll be rough on night-shift guys,
having to be here in the afternoon.

157
00:10:59,642 --> 00:11:02,406
We need to adhere to
JCAHO guidelines all the time.

158
00:11:02,645 --> 00:11:04,636
Not just when we expect the committee.

159
00:11:04,914 --> 00:11:07,474
- Nurses'll hate that.
- Rules were created for a reason.

160
00:11:07,717 --> 00:11:12,211
Take the board for example. Patient
confidentiality is breached every day.

161
00:11:12,455 --> 00:11:16,186
Here, look at this entry.
"Al Johnson. Penile discharge."

162
00:11:16,425 --> 00:11:18,222
How would you feel if that were you?

163
00:11:18,461 --> 00:11:22,192
Not only are we risking lawsuits,
but we could lose our accreditation.

164
00:11:22,431 --> 00:11:25,889
Unit 79's bringing in
an 86-year-old male, altered LOC.

165
00:11:26,102 --> 00:11:28,127
I've created a diagnostic code.

166
00:11:28,371 --> 00:11:31,704
It's a list of a few hundred
two-letter combinations...

167
00:11:31,974 --> 00:11:33,965
...of common patient complaints.

168
00:11:34,243 --> 00:11:37,770
We can use patients' social security
numbers to protect anonymity.

169
00:11:38,047 --> 00:11:40,140
"BE"? Barium enema?

170
00:11:40,383 --> 00:11:41,680
Blunt Extremity Trauma.

171
00:11:41,917 --> 00:11:45,284
Some guy with a bruise will get
a radioactive colon cleansing.

172
00:11:45,521 --> 00:11:47,113
Mark, can I talk to you later?

173
00:11:47,356 --> 00:11:49,085
Yeah, sure. This afternoon?

174
00:11:49,325 --> 00:11:52,158
There's a conference on Saturday
at Northwestern.

175
00:11:52,395 --> 00:11:56,559
"Modern Architecture for Emergency
Medicine Management." We should go.

176
00:11:56,799 --> 00:12:00,394
Saturday I'm with my daughter.
Why don't you go and fill me in?

177
00:12:00,603 --> 00:12:01,968
Sure. I'll tape it.

178
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:06,503
She's gotta be kidding.

179
00:12:06,942 --> 00:12:09,206
- What brings you in today?
- I'm sick.

180
00:12:09,445 --> 00:12:10,343
What's wrong?

181
00:12:10,579 --> 00:12:12,444
Stomach hurts.
Didn't you tell him?

182
00:12:12,681 --> 00:12:15,241
- When did this pain start?
- I don't know.

183
00:12:15,484 --> 00:12:16,416
This morning maybe?

184
00:12:16,652 --> 00:12:18,711
I said I don't know.
Is he an idiot?

185
00:12:18,954 --> 00:12:21,650
- How old are you?
- Old enough. Tell me if this hurts.

186
00:12:24,693 --> 00:12:26,854
- The abdomen is tender.
- I gathered that.

187
00:12:27,096 --> 00:12:29,826
Let's order a CBC, Chem-7
and an abdominal series.

188
00:12:30,065 --> 00:12:31,362
They're done.

189
00:12:31,567 --> 00:12:35,697
I'll check your tests, Mrs. Lukesi,
but I'm afraid you'll require surgery.

190
00:12:35,938 --> 00:12:38,463
You don't want to examine her
a little more?

191
00:12:38,741 --> 00:12:41,301
She's had previous surgery.
Probably has adhesions.

192
00:12:41,577 --> 00:12:42,942
You sure he's a doctor?

193
00:12:43,179 --> 00:12:45,943
You might consider doing a rectal.

194
00:12:46,182 --> 00:12:49,242
Never let the sun set
on a small bowel obstruction.

195
00:12:50,352 --> 00:12:53,014
May I see you for a moment?
Excuse us, ma'am.

196
00:12:54,123 --> 00:12:56,114
What's taking so long?
I come for an appy...

197
00:12:56,358 --> 00:12:58,986
...you have four patients on the board.
Did you check it?

198
00:12:59,228 --> 00:13:00,354
I got beeped to...

199
00:13:00,596 --> 00:13:04,293
Check the board first. How could you
tell this patient was emergent?

200
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:06,832
Small bowel obstruction.
She'll need surgery.

201
00:13:14,543 --> 00:13:16,306
I'd like to scrub in on this one.

202
00:13:16,579 --> 00:13:21,278
Carter, all surgical abdomens require
a rectal. Even first-years know that.

203
00:13:21,517 --> 00:13:23,109
She's impacted.

204
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:27,880
Check on the rest of your patients.
Then disimpact her.

205
00:13:28,123 --> 00:13:29,818
- That's a nurse's job.
- Not today.

206
00:13:33,128 --> 00:13:35,892
88-year-old male.
Altered LOC, hypotensive...

207
00:13:36,131 --> 00:13:38,622
...BP 60 palp, sinus tach at 128.

208
00:13:38,834 --> 00:13:41,598
Resps shallow at 30.
Skin's warm and dry.

209
00:13:41,837 --> 00:13:44,533
Couldn't get an IV.
O-2, four liters nasal cannula.

210
00:13:44,807 --> 00:13:46,365
Let's go. Trauma 1.

211
00:13:46,642 --> 00:13:49,304
What are all these
letters and numbers?

212
00:13:49,578 --> 00:13:51,045
Confidentiality system.

213
00:13:51,313 --> 00:13:54,248
How can I tell who's surgical
and who's medical?

214
00:13:55,084 --> 00:13:57,416
I don't have time!
Whose stupid idea is this?

215
00:13:57,653 --> 00:14:02,090
Mine. First day on the surgical
service? Nice to have you with us.

216
00:14:02,324 --> 00:14:04,258
Need a surgeon in 1. Is Benton in?

217
00:14:04,493 --> 00:14:06,427
That's you, right? Let's go.

218
00:14:06,662 --> 00:14:10,223
There's always a first time.
Might as well get it over with.

219
00:14:21,810 --> 00:14:23,539
Somebody called for a surgeon.

220
00:14:24,547 --> 00:14:27,277
- Drop a central line.
- I'll intubate after it's in.

221
00:14:28,350 --> 00:14:29,339
Pulse ox is 85.

222
00:14:29,585 --> 00:14:31,348
Trendelenburg, please, nurse.

223
00:14:34,356 --> 00:14:37,553
Central-line kit.
One percent lidocaine with epi.

224
00:14:39,094 --> 00:14:41,028
- Thank you, nurse.
- Intubation tray.

225
00:14:47,236 --> 00:14:49,636
- Angle toward the sternal notch.
- I know.

226
00:14:50,005 --> 00:14:51,165
Foley's in.

227
00:14:54,577 --> 00:14:55,737
Come on.

228
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:00,776
- How are you doing over there?
- Almost.

229
00:15:01,083 --> 00:15:02,448
Almost.

230
00:15:12,661 --> 00:15:15,528
I can't find it.
Prep for a right subclavian approach.

231
00:15:21,070 --> 00:15:22,059
Please...

232
00:15:22,304 --> 00:15:23,794
Try not to hit the lung.

233
00:15:28,611 --> 00:15:29,407
What do we got?

234
00:15:29,645 --> 00:15:34,514
88-year-old male needs a central line.
I tried a right subclavian approach.

235
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:36,547
- Set me up.
- I nicked his lung.

236
00:15:37,453 --> 00:15:40,081
- Decreased breath sounds.
- I need to intubate.

237
00:15:40,322 --> 00:15:41,983
His veins must've collapsed.

238
00:15:46,061 --> 00:15:47,858
I'm in. Stethoscope.

239
00:15:52,101 --> 00:15:54,535
Get Respiratory down here
to set up a vent.

240
00:15:55,304 --> 00:15:58,273
Congratulations, Carter.
Your patient needs a chest tube.

241
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:01,236
- Chest-tube tray, 28 French.
- Ten blade.

242
00:16:02,611 --> 00:16:06,047
Hook me up. Hold still for
the driver. Vaseline gauze is next.

243
00:16:06,315 --> 00:16:07,907
Four-by-fours.
How's his pressure?

244
00:16:08,150 --> 00:16:09,981
- 90 systolic.
- Two liters, wide open.

245
00:16:10,219 --> 00:16:11,948
Temp's 103.

246
00:16:12,855 --> 00:16:15,483
Cefuroxime, 1.5 grams Q8.

247
00:16:15,724 --> 00:16:17,715
I'd cover him for Pseudomonas.

248
00:16:19,094 --> 00:16:20,391
Ceftazidime.

249
00:16:20,896 --> 00:16:23,296
Two grams Q8, plus gent.

250
00:16:23,532 --> 00:16:26,990
All right, people. Somebody
call up Radiology, get a stat...

251
00:16:33,308 --> 00:16:35,708
Listen to this.
"Pearl-white beaches...

252
00:16:35,944 --> 00:16:39,004
...set against an azure-blue sky.

253
00:16:39,281 --> 00:16:42,375
Cool breezes that make
your semi-detached bungalow...

254
00:16:42,618 --> 00:16:44,085
...your own little paradise."

255
00:16:44,319 --> 00:16:46,344
- Where's that?
- Micronesia.

256
00:16:46,588 --> 00:16:49,989
- Where's that?
- Who cares? It's a long way from here.

257
00:16:50,225 --> 00:16:52,989
"Dive with Lenny and Francis
at Fish-n-Fins...

258
00:16:53,228 --> 00:16:55,958
...Palau's most experienced
charter operators."

259
00:16:56,198 --> 00:16:57,688
Is that a shark?

260
00:16:58,033 --> 00:17:00,126
Five or six of them. Cool, huh?

261
00:17:00,569 --> 00:17:01,934
Oh, look!

262
00:17:02,171 --> 00:17:04,901
Hawaii! Have you ever been to Hawaii?

263
00:17:05,174 --> 00:17:06,641
Hawaii, South Pacific...

264
00:17:06,909 --> 00:17:11,073
Don't all these places require that
you fly over water at great heights?

265
00:17:11,313 --> 00:17:14,942
I don't care. I'll self-medicate
and sleep through the whole thing.

266
00:17:15,184 --> 00:17:17,778
I can't understand a thing.
What the hell is "OT"?

267
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:20,853
Occupational Therapy?
Half the patients need it.

268
00:17:21,090 --> 00:17:23,058
Other. You put it
when you don't know.

269
00:17:23,292 --> 00:17:25,624
Or you're too busy to
look up the abbreviations.

270
00:17:25,861 --> 00:17:27,954
Give it time.
Rome wasn't built in a day.

271
00:17:28,197 --> 00:17:30,631
And what's "PU"?
I can't find it in the book.

272
00:17:30,833 --> 00:17:32,733
Pleuritic chest pain.

273
00:17:34,303 --> 00:17:36,828
- "EH"?
- Behavioral problems in psych.

274
00:17:37,072 --> 00:17:38,334
How's he do that?

275
00:17:38,607 --> 00:17:40,199
I reviewed the notes at lunch.

276
00:17:40,476 --> 00:17:43,912
Dr. Benton, some outside lab
called with test results for you.

277
00:17:44,179 --> 00:17:46,147
- How long ago?
- A couple hours.

278
00:17:46,415 --> 00:17:48,144
Why the hell didn't you tell me?

279
00:17:58,427 --> 00:18:00,054
Hi. You have an appointment?

280
00:18:00,295 --> 00:18:01,660
I thought this was walk-in.

281
00:18:01,897 --> 00:18:06,095
Normally, but with the holiday, things
are jammed. You here for testing?

282
00:18:06,769 --> 00:18:07,565
No.

283
00:18:07,803 --> 00:18:09,395
You are HIV-positive?

284
00:18:09,638 --> 00:18:11,037
- Yes.
- When did you find out?

285
00:18:11,306 --> 00:18:13,570
Yesterday. I'll come back later.

286
00:18:13,842 --> 00:18:18,108
Wait. Fill out a form, and I'll
make sure you get in to see somebody.

287
00:18:20,249 --> 00:18:23,685
Top form is general information.
Next pages are for insurance.

288
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:25,778
Thanks.

289
00:18:47,009 --> 00:18:48,499
You work here?

290
00:18:50,245 --> 00:18:51,507
In the ER.

291
00:18:53,582 --> 00:18:55,311
HIV-positive?

292
00:19:09,531 --> 00:19:12,364
You haven't told anyone
you work with, have you?

293
00:19:12,568 --> 00:19:13,967
Not really.

294
00:19:16,538 --> 00:19:18,506
You shouldn't be here.

295
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:22,972
Go someplace else for treatment,
somewhere where they don't know you.

296
00:19:27,282 --> 00:19:30,342
I was a surgical tech
over at Southside.

297
00:19:30,586 --> 00:19:33,453
Believe me, don't tell anyone
you're HIV-positive.

298
00:19:33,689 --> 00:19:36,214
Especially not anyone in management.

299
00:19:36,625 --> 00:19:37,614
They can't fire me.

300
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:39,760
Not legally. No.

301
00:19:39,995 --> 00:19:44,898
When I came up positive four years ago,
I told the chief of surgery.

302
00:19:45,767 --> 00:19:50,067
They sent me to Gerontology. Wouldn't
let me do anything but take BPs.

303
00:19:50,806 --> 00:19:54,674
When that didn't work, they stuck me
down in Pathology working nights.

304
00:19:55,611 --> 00:19:59,172
After six months of that,
I finally quit.

305
00:20:00,916 --> 00:20:02,611
Been there for eight years.

306
00:20:06,822 --> 00:20:09,188
There's a real good clinic
in Highland Park.

307
00:20:09,424 --> 00:20:12,655
It's a long drive,
but it'd be a lot safer.

308
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:19,863
I'm sorry if I'm scaring you.

309
00:20:20,102 --> 00:20:21,262
Matthew?

310
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:27,005
I'm Matt Hymes.
What's your name?

311
00:20:28,543 --> 00:20:31,910
Maybe I should give you an alias.
Jeanie Boulet.

312
00:20:32,481 --> 00:20:35,712
Get out of here, Jeanie.
Don't ever come back.

313
00:20:43,959 --> 00:20:46,393
This is Dr. Benton over at County.

314
00:20:47,963 --> 00:20:51,592
You have the results of an AIDS test
for a patient of mine.

315
00:20:53,001 --> 00:20:54,298
I know it's late.

316
00:20:55,103 --> 00:20:59,199
I don't want the patient to agonize
over this thing over the weekend.

317
00:21:01,076 --> 00:21:03,010
I'd really appreciate it.

318
00:21:03,912 --> 00:21:06,210
The patient's name is Benjamin.

319
00:21:06,448 --> 00:21:08,040
Peter Benjamin.

320
00:21:09,851 --> 00:21:11,716
Yeah, thanks. Thanks.

321
00:21:18,493 --> 00:21:20,256
Yeah, I'm still here.

322
00:21:28,303 --> 00:21:29,361
Thank you.

323
00:21:34,309 --> 00:21:35,401
Thank you.

324
00:21:51,593 --> 00:21:55,051
Dr. Benton, I'm caught up,
and my night shift doesn't start...

325
00:21:55,297 --> 00:21:57,265
...for a half-hour. Should I go eat?

326
00:21:57,466 --> 00:21:59,559
Take 10 minutes, then find Melvoin.

327
00:21:59,801 --> 00:22:02,964
- Ten minutes.
- That's more than you'll usually get.

328
00:22:03,205 --> 00:22:04,194
You with me tonight?

329
00:22:04,473 --> 00:22:07,340
No. Karubian's the Resident on call.

330
00:22:09,277 --> 00:22:10,073
You okay?

331
00:22:21,056 --> 00:22:22,751
I'm fine, Carter.

332
00:22:27,062 --> 00:22:28,290
Going to the picnic?

333
00:22:28,530 --> 00:22:31,260
Are you kidding?
Last year six at bats, 15 RBIs.

334
00:22:31,466 --> 00:22:33,127
I love to play the Pede's unit.

335
00:22:33,368 --> 00:22:35,632
We're playing the paramedics
this year.

336
00:22:35,871 --> 00:22:37,236
Finally? Who set that up?

337
00:22:37,506 --> 00:22:40,031
It was either that or the Orthopods.

338
00:22:40,308 --> 00:22:44,335
Ortho's got two ex-All-Americans and
one retired minor league shortstop.

339
00:22:44,613 --> 00:22:47,377
If you're going to the picnic,
pick up more chicken.

340
00:22:47,616 --> 00:22:50,881
Darcy called. Her kid's sick.
She can't work tonight.

341
00:22:51,887 --> 00:22:54,617
- Anybody wanna pull a double?
- On the Fourth of July?

342
00:22:54,856 --> 00:22:58,257
Come on, guys.
Please? Somebody?

343
00:22:58,527 --> 00:23:01,496
- I'm playing right field.
- It's tough being boss, huh?

344
00:23:01,730 --> 00:23:03,755
You could always quit again.

345
00:23:04,199 --> 00:23:06,759
I can cover for a few hours
if you come back by 10.

346
00:23:07,002 --> 00:23:08,697
- Thanks, Lily.
- Where you going?

347
00:23:08,937 --> 00:23:11,804
- Barbecue and softball game.
- Everybody's going?

348
00:23:12,074 --> 00:23:14,599
- I'm coming back.
- Bring me some barbecue.

349
00:23:14,876 --> 00:23:17,401
- Anything else, doctor?
- Chicken, no dark meat.

350
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:20,170
And beans and lots of coleslaw.

351
00:23:20,449 --> 00:23:22,781
- Carter's getting a little uppity.
- Really.

352
00:23:23,018 --> 00:23:26,681
- He may need a little potty training.
- I'd be delighted.

353
00:23:29,524 --> 00:23:30,957
Last day, huh?

354
00:23:31,193 --> 00:23:35,994
My vacation begins in 14 minutes
and 24 seconds. I set my watch.

355
00:23:36,231 --> 00:23:37,391
Fourth of July.

356
00:23:37,599 --> 00:23:39,226
You're in for a treat tonight.

357
00:23:39,468 --> 00:23:41,993
Knife and Gun Club
should get going later.

358
00:23:42,237 --> 00:23:43,670
- Where we going?
- Surgical wards.

359
00:23:43,905 --> 00:23:46,635
- Why?
- You're covering them tonight.

360
00:23:47,542 --> 00:23:49,510
- I'm covering the ER.
- That too.

361
00:23:49,778 --> 00:23:53,009
And the SICU. O.R. Prep
if the Resident needs you.

362
00:23:53,248 --> 00:23:56,877
Trauma team, Pre-Op
and all the surgical admits.

363
00:24:10,432 --> 00:24:12,525
Look what the cat dragged in.

364
00:24:14,836 --> 00:24:15,928
Got a good turnout.

365
00:24:16,171 --> 00:24:19,732
You know this neighborhood.
Mention food, and they come running.

366
00:24:22,144 --> 00:24:23,076
I'm glad you came.

367
00:24:23,345 --> 00:24:24,607
I said I was gonna come.

368
00:24:24,846 --> 00:24:28,247
I figured you were lying, like always.

369
00:24:30,185 --> 00:24:31,413
Why are you so happy?

370
00:24:31,887 --> 00:24:33,047
I can't be happy?

371
00:24:38,693 --> 00:24:40,422
You knew she was coming.

372
00:24:41,997 --> 00:24:43,464
That's why you showed up.

373
00:24:44,866 --> 00:24:47,960
Jackie, how many times I gotta
tell you we're just friends?

374
00:24:50,305 --> 00:24:51,567
Can I get you a drink?

375
00:24:53,742 --> 00:24:55,710
Yeah. Some juice.

376
00:24:57,612 --> 00:24:59,443
I know what I'm doing.

377
00:24:59,681 --> 00:25:01,114
Hey, man. What's up, doc?

378
00:25:01,383 --> 00:25:03,851
This crazy woman thinks
she knows how to grill.

379
00:25:04,719 --> 00:25:07,586
Get out of here. Bald men
don't know how to barbecue.

380
00:25:07,822 --> 00:25:12,350
She's mad because I'm a big, black,
bald, beautiful, barbecue-cooking man.

381
00:25:13,028 --> 00:25:15,428
I'm gonna get some chicken.
I'll be back.

382
00:25:15,664 --> 00:25:16,460
All right, Wally.

383
00:25:16,698 --> 00:25:18,131
I want my place back!

384
00:25:21,303 --> 00:25:25,103
- How are you doing?
- Pass me that plate over there.

385
00:25:29,444 --> 00:25:30,604
You look good.

386
00:25:31,746 --> 00:25:34,180
You don't come around
the restaurant no more.

387
00:25:36,685 --> 00:25:37,481
I gave up meat.

388
00:25:37,719 --> 00:25:40,711
I heard that about you. I did.

389
00:25:40,956 --> 00:25:43,049
Those long hours
you been working, I bet.

390
00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:47,185
Yeah. Keeps me pretty busy, you know.

391
00:25:47,429 --> 00:25:48,987
It's a shame.

392
00:25:49,631 --> 00:25:51,861
No time for old friends.

393
00:25:58,173 --> 00:25:59,936
I get an hour here and there.

394
00:26:00,842 --> 00:26:04,107
Well, it only takes an hour, Peter.

395
00:26:05,380 --> 00:26:07,371
Or don't you remember?

396
00:26:11,853 --> 00:26:12,979
Oh, man.

397
00:26:13,521 --> 00:26:14,715
Jeanie.

398
00:26:16,858 --> 00:26:18,382
- How you feeling?
- I'm fine.

399
00:26:18,627 --> 00:26:21,221
- And how's your husband?
- He's doing all right.

400
00:26:21,463 --> 00:26:22,657
Good. That's great.

401
00:26:25,367 --> 00:26:26,527
Did you get that test?

402
00:26:30,372 --> 00:26:31,304
It was negative.

403
00:26:31,573 --> 00:26:32,369
That's great.

404
00:26:35,677 --> 00:26:39,443
I won't keep you any longer.
I'm glad the news was good.

405
00:26:44,052 --> 00:26:46,077
Let's go, Jer. Lock on the ball!

406
00:26:59,067 --> 00:27:00,261
Safe!

407
00:27:00,869 --> 00:27:02,461
Who told Jerry to pitch?

408
00:27:03,238 --> 00:27:04,102
- 17-3.
- Let's go!

409
00:27:05,206 --> 00:27:07,902
Why don't we forfeit
and get back to drinking?

410
00:27:08,176 --> 00:27:10,667
Jerry! Come on. 17-3.
We're still in it.

411
00:27:10,945 --> 00:27:13,209
Let's go! 17-3!
We're still in this.

412
00:27:13,448 --> 00:27:14,813
Jer, come on!

413
00:27:15,083 --> 00:27:15,947
We're in it.

414
00:27:16,851 --> 00:27:18,216
Let's spin that ball!

415
00:27:23,491 --> 00:27:25,049
I got it! I got it!

416
00:27:25,293 --> 00:27:26,555
I got it!

417
00:27:27,862 --> 00:27:31,195
That's a momentum swing.
This is our inning. Let's go!

418
00:27:38,907 --> 00:27:40,101
You playing?

419
00:27:40,508 --> 00:27:42,942
I don't know. I just got off work.

420
00:27:43,278 --> 00:27:45,337
My guys are doing okay without me.

421
00:27:45,613 --> 00:27:47,444
Your guys are kicking our butts.

422
00:27:48,817 --> 00:27:50,341
Your boom box is at my house.

423
00:27:50,585 --> 00:27:52,143
I got a new one.

424
00:27:53,988 --> 00:27:56,582
My old one have my
<i>Best of Conway Twitty</i> tape in it?

425
00:27:56,825 --> 00:27:58,156
If it did, I'd burn it.

426
00:27:58,793 --> 00:28:00,317
What happened to my beer?

427
00:28:02,664 --> 00:28:07,101
Vicki Pastroni, this is Carol Hathaway.
She's the head nurse at County.

428
00:28:07,302 --> 00:28:08,234
Nice to meet you.

429
00:28:12,674 --> 00:28:15,108
Greene's gonna try
to make a game of this one.

430
00:28:16,010 --> 00:28:17,602
Maybe I'd better go warm up.

431
00:28:29,524 --> 00:28:30,320
You all right?

432
00:28:34,696 --> 00:28:35,993
Fireworks!

433
00:28:57,619 --> 00:29:00,315
Oh, I love fireworks.

434
00:29:00,989 --> 00:29:02,081
Me too.

435
00:29:02,323 --> 00:29:03,483
They're beautiful.

436
00:29:03,725 --> 00:29:06,285
If we're all here, who's at work?

437
00:29:08,062 --> 00:29:09,393
I don't know.

438
00:29:10,932 --> 00:29:12,365
I don't care.

439
00:29:16,070 --> 00:29:18,300
Dr. Carter, get one A-V.

440
00:29:18,573 --> 00:29:20,632
Step up here, Dr. Carter.

441
00:29:20,942 --> 00:29:22,671
He's arrested.

442
00:29:23,011 --> 00:29:24,410
Thoracotomy tray.

443
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:27,978
Make the incision deep and fast.

444
00:29:28,216 --> 00:29:29,513
Spreader.

445
00:29:31,286 --> 00:29:32,913
Vascular clamp.

446
00:29:40,028 --> 00:29:41,427
- Dr. Carter?
- I'm up.

447
00:29:43,698 --> 00:29:44,494
What?

448
00:29:44,699 --> 00:29:48,066
Mrs. Nuprik's temp's up to 100.
Can we give her Tylenol?

449
00:29:48,436 --> 00:29:52,372
- How long have I been asleep?
- About 10 minutes. Tylenol?

450
00:29:53,441 --> 00:29:54,908
- Yeah, great.
- Two?

451
00:29:55,176 --> 00:29:56,666
Two. Right.

452
00:30:04,319 --> 00:30:05,752
Dr. Carter?

453
00:30:05,987 --> 00:30:09,718
Can we give Mr. Sifkin some toast?
He's asking for something to eat.

454
00:30:09,958 --> 00:30:12,256
- Sifkin?
- Leg lac?

455
00:30:13,528 --> 00:30:15,052
Toast okay?

456
00:30:15,630 --> 00:30:18,428
Toast, oatmeal, prime rib, whatever.

457
00:30:18,633 --> 00:30:20,430
Thank you, doctor.

458
00:30:22,303 --> 00:30:23,736
Toast.

459
00:30:28,243 --> 00:30:31,508
Do you want a stool culture on
Mrs. Haney? She's got diarrhea.

460
00:30:31,746 --> 00:30:34,180
Haney? That's Weaver's
patient, right?

461
00:30:34,415 --> 00:30:37,179
- What does she say?
- She's upstairs getting coffee.

462
00:30:37,418 --> 00:30:39,079
- What would you do?
- Not bother.

463
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:42,289
- Let's not bother then, okay?
- Thank you, doctor.

464
00:30:42,690 --> 00:30:43,952
Haleh.

465
00:30:44,626 --> 00:30:47,026
It's always like this
when somebody's sleeping?

466
00:30:47,262 --> 00:30:51,699
I wouldn't know, doctor. Nurses
aren't allowed to sleep on shift.

467
00:31:13,454 --> 00:31:16,548
- Should I beep him again?
- Only if he doesn't come out.

468
00:31:16,991 --> 00:31:17,787
Bingo!

469
00:31:18,026 --> 00:31:20,392
Cops bringing in a drunk.
Fell through a window.

470
00:31:20,628 --> 00:31:22,721
Find a bed.
This guy's growing roots.

471
00:31:22,964 --> 00:31:26,900
Resident says there's no beds, because
he doesn't wanna work anybody up.

472
00:31:27,101 --> 00:31:29,092
Good morning, Dr. Carter.
Get any sleep?

473
00:31:29,337 --> 00:31:31,703
Somebody beeped me? You, Ray?

474
00:31:31,973 --> 00:31:33,531
No. Maybe another floor?

475
00:31:33,808 --> 00:31:38,006
- 6195. That's the ER, isn't it?
- Yes, but I didn't page you.

476
00:31:38,246 --> 00:31:40,646
Must've been some kind of mistake.

477
00:31:40,882 --> 00:31:43,442
They can make your life
easy or miserable.

478
00:31:43,685 --> 00:31:46,245
Whatever you did,
I suggest you apologize.

479
00:31:46,487 --> 00:31:48,512
- I didn't do anything.
- Apologize anyway.

480
00:31:48,756 --> 00:31:52,283
Police are bringing in a drunk.
Went through a plate-glass window.

481
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:55,185
This guy was busting windows
with his fist.

482
00:31:55,430 --> 00:31:58,092
Tried to bust a display at The Gap
but couldn't.

483
00:31:58,299 --> 00:32:01,393
So he went over across
the street. Went right through.

484
00:32:01,636 --> 00:32:03,866
We found him in Women's Underwear.

485
00:32:07,709 --> 00:32:09,040
Could someone help me out?

486
00:32:16,050 --> 00:32:17,711
I got him! I got him!

487
00:32:20,788 --> 00:32:22,756
Clean it up and check his tetanus.

488
00:32:22,991 --> 00:32:26,188
And prepare him for suturing,
lots of suturing.

489
00:32:26,427 --> 00:32:28,190
That'll take the rest of the night.

490
00:32:28,429 --> 00:32:32,331
- Dr. Carter! Conni! I need you.
- Let me know when he's ready.

491
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:34,267
Elderly man vomiting blood.

492
00:32:34,502 --> 00:32:39,166
BP 100 over 70. Pulse is thready
at 145. Two IVs in the field.

493
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:41,067
- He's yellow.
- Don't we know him?

494
00:32:41,342 --> 00:32:44,106
Jim. A regular.
Alcoholic, cirrhosis, seizures.

495
00:32:46,014 --> 00:32:47,345
He's drunk.

496
00:32:49,617 --> 00:32:50,914
Let's move him.

497
00:32:51,152 --> 00:32:53,052
Gently, now. One.

498
00:32:53,287 --> 00:32:54,413
Two.

499
00:32:54,656 --> 00:32:55,554
Three.

500
00:32:56,658 --> 00:32:57,852
He's got a scalp lac.

501
00:32:58,092 --> 00:33:00,788
Found him in the gutter.
He may have hit his head.

502
00:33:01,029 --> 00:33:03,964
- What's that smell?
- Code brown in the shorts. Blood too.

503
00:33:04,165 --> 00:33:07,862
CBC, type and cross,
four units, coag panel.

504
00:33:08,102 --> 00:33:10,332
Dr. Carter, help us with an NG.

505
00:33:10,571 --> 00:33:12,368
Hang the banana bag wide open.

506
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:15,438
- I'm ready for you, Dr. Carter.
- Hold still, sir.

507
00:33:15,677 --> 00:33:17,144
What's your surgical plan?

508
00:33:17,412 --> 00:33:20,074
Transfuse and take him to
the GI lab for endoscopy.

509
00:33:20,314 --> 00:33:22,339
- Cauterize bleeding sites.
- Sounds right.

510
00:33:22,884 --> 00:33:23,714
Did you hear me?

511
00:33:23,951 --> 00:33:26,613
Damn it, Malik! I'll be
there as soon as I can!

512
00:33:31,993 --> 00:33:32,789
Sure.

513
00:33:33,428 --> 00:33:34,793
Take your time.

514
00:33:35,830 --> 00:33:37,263
Burn victims on their way.

515
00:33:37,465 --> 00:33:40,662
Set up 1 and alert Plastic.
They'll be right there.

516
00:33:42,804 --> 00:33:44,863
Don't look at us.
We're working here.

517
00:33:45,106 --> 00:33:46,937
- Tube's in.
- What's 1019?

518
00:33:47,208 --> 00:33:49,108
Surgical ICU.

519
00:33:50,878 --> 00:33:53,278
This is John Carter.
You just paged me.

520
00:33:53,915 --> 00:33:57,316
How many days since the surgery?
All right, I'll be right over.

521
00:33:57,919 --> 00:34:00,888
Post-op, day two. Triple-A repair.
Guy's desatting.

522
00:34:01,122 --> 00:34:04,558
Don't be gone long, doctor.
We're getting buried down here.

523
00:34:30,785 --> 00:34:32,275
Can I help you?

524
00:34:34,989 --> 00:34:36,456
I'm Dr. Carter.

525
00:34:38,059 --> 00:34:41,290
66-year-old male. Abdominal
aneurysm repaired two days ago.

526
00:34:41,529 --> 00:34:45,397
Dropped his crit. I don't know if
he's leaking or if he's hemodiluted.

527
00:34:46,134 --> 00:34:49,535
- What do you think?
- I hope he's not bleeding out.

528
00:34:49,937 --> 00:34:51,734
Should we transfuse or diurese?

529
00:34:52,006 --> 00:34:53,166
That's why I called you.

530
00:34:55,476 --> 00:34:58,070
- What's his crit?
- 30. It was 33 an hour ago.

531
00:34:58,346 --> 00:35:00,712
Haven't seen your Resident.
He's asleep?

532
00:35:00,948 --> 00:35:03,439
- What time does he get up?
- Sometime after 5.

533
00:35:04,318 --> 00:35:05,808
That's two hours.

534
00:35:06,487 --> 00:35:07,283
Two hours.

535
00:35:10,525 --> 00:35:13,392
Do you wanna wait and see
how low his crit goes?

536
00:35:14,796 --> 00:35:18,061
If I don't transfuse and he's
bleeding out, he'll go into shock.

537
00:35:18,266 --> 00:35:22,498
And if I diurese and I'm wrong,
he'll go into renal failure, right?

538
00:35:25,740 --> 00:35:29,870
It's the ER, 911.
Where's Dr. Karubian sleeping?

539
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:33,447
Dr. Karubian?

540
00:35:33,714 --> 00:35:37,013
It better be important, or you'll
be draining rectal abscesses...

541
00:35:37,251 --> 00:35:39,082
...for the rest of your Residency.

542
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:43,484
Post-op, day two. Aneurysm repair.
Crit's 30, sat's down to 90.

543
00:35:43,724 --> 00:35:46,454
- Is he on oxygen?
- Nasal cannula. Yes, sir.

544
00:35:46,694 --> 00:35:49,424
Try a mask. Check his crit
again in half an hour.

545
00:35:49,664 --> 00:35:50,756
Thank you, sir.

546
00:35:50,965 --> 00:35:52,557
It's Carter, right?

547
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:53,732
Yes. Right, sir.

548
00:35:53,968 --> 00:35:57,028
All right. Shut up, Carter,
and close the door.

549
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:03,041
Fifteen liters oxygen by mask,
and call me in half an hour.

550
00:36:05,213 --> 00:36:07,044
- What's going on?
- Third-degree burns.

551
00:36:07,281 --> 00:36:08,976
Kid was playing with fireworks.

552
00:36:09,217 --> 00:36:10,912
Pulse ox is 65 on 100% O-2.

553
00:36:11,152 --> 00:36:13,620
Nice of you to join us.
Where you been?

554
00:36:13,855 --> 00:36:17,951
- I was up in the SICU.
- Acute pulmonary edema. Six ET tube.

555
00:36:18,226 --> 00:36:20,353
Versed. Guy next door's in trouble.

556
00:36:20,595 --> 00:36:23,962
Go! When I page 911, I want you
out of breath when you show up!

557
00:36:24,365 --> 00:36:26,424
- What's going on?
- He's taching at 200.

558
00:36:26,868 --> 00:36:28,768
- What?
- No palpable BP. Looks like SVT.

559
00:36:29,003 --> 00:36:30,300
Cardiovert, right?

560
00:36:30,872 --> 00:36:32,601
- How much?
- I'd start at 50.

561
00:36:32,874 --> 00:36:35,775
Hit the synch switch.
All right, everybody off!

562
00:36:37,778 --> 00:36:39,268
A hundred. Off!

563
00:36:42,817 --> 00:36:43,613
Okay, sinus.

564
00:36:43,851 --> 00:36:44,943
BP 70 palp.
Dopamine?

565
00:36:48,990 --> 00:36:50,514
- Dopamine?
- I don't know!

566
00:36:50,758 --> 00:36:52,055
Somebody call a doctor!

567
00:36:52,293 --> 00:36:53,851
You are the doctor.

568
00:36:59,934 --> 00:37:00,992
Right. Dopamine.

569
00:37:01,235 --> 00:37:05,069
Titrate to a systolic of 100.

570
00:37:05,740 --> 00:37:09,836
I can do this. He's not breathing.
We have to intubate. 7.5 now.

571
00:37:10,111 --> 00:37:11,100
IV's blown.

572
00:37:11,379 --> 00:37:13,347
In a minute. I got it.

573
00:37:14,248 --> 00:37:15,647
Let me get in there.

574
00:37:19,954 --> 00:37:21,421
Need any help in here?

575
00:37:21,656 --> 00:37:22,884
Early, aren't you?

576
00:37:23,124 --> 00:37:25,888
I couldn't sleep.
Figured you could use a hand.

577
00:37:26,127 --> 00:37:29,221
Get a third line started.
IV's blown. Bag him.

578
00:37:31,866 --> 00:37:34,699
- What's wrong with him?
- Alcoholic, GI bleed...

579
00:37:34,936 --> 00:37:37,530
...history of cirrhosis,
possible subdural hematoma.

580
00:37:37,772 --> 00:37:39,330
- Had to cardiovert.
- You're kidding.

581
00:37:39,607 --> 00:37:43,441
Zapped him twice. Got him back.
He went apneic, and I had to tube him.

582
00:37:43,678 --> 00:37:44,474
Your first night?

583
00:37:44,712 --> 00:37:48,239
I haven't even told you about the guy
who desatted in the SICU.

584
00:37:53,587 --> 00:37:56,317
Interns' breakfast starts
in a couple minutes.

585
00:37:56,757 --> 00:37:58,816
Last ones.

586
00:38:00,561 --> 00:38:02,859
- Breakfast.
- Right.

587
00:38:03,097 --> 00:38:05,930
This year I'll associate
omelets and oatmeal...

588
00:38:06,133 --> 00:38:08,465
...with a deep sense
of personal inadequacy.

589
00:38:09,603 --> 00:38:13,095
- How many sutures have we put in him?
- I lost count. Hundreds.

590
00:38:13,374 --> 00:38:14,136
At least.

591
00:38:15,643 --> 00:38:17,133
How you holding up?

592
00:38:18,879 --> 00:38:20,574
I'm really tired.

593
00:38:23,918 --> 00:38:27,081
But I can look on the bright side.
I'm off in 13 hours.

594
00:38:28,422 --> 00:38:29,514
I'm on tonight.

595
00:38:29,757 --> 00:38:32,453
- Thanks for coming in to help.
- It's no problem.

596
00:38:35,663 --> 00:38:36,595
We're done.

597
00:38:37,331 --> 00:38:40,823
Well, then I guess it's time for
our early morning humiliation.

598
00:38:41,569 --> 00:38:42,934
Benton's breakfast it is.

599
00:38:43,170 --> 00:38:46,799
Just in time too. I was starting
to feel too good about myself.

600
00:38:57,985 --> 00:38:59,612
Did you get your test back?

601
00:39:06,794 --> 00:39:07,852
It was negative.

602
00:39:10,664 --> 00:39:11,653
That's good.

603
00:39:13,234 --> 00:39:14,428
I'm glad.

604
00:39:17,171 --> 00:39:18,365
Have you told anyone?

605
00:39:18,606 --> 00:39:19,834
About my test? No.

606
00:39:20,107 --> 00:39:21,404
About me.

607
00:39:24,845 --> 00:39:27,245
Good. I don't want you to.

608
00:39:27,481 --> 00:39:29,540
I've decided not to tell anyone.

609
00:39:32,019 --> 00:39:33,384
Greene told you to do that?

610
00:39:33,621 --> 00:39:37,489
No. It's a personal decision.
I'd appreciate it if you'd honor it.

611
00:39:39,927 --> 00:39:42,657
Jeanie, are you asking me
to lie for you?

612
00:39:42,897 --> 00:39:45,832
No. I'm asking you
to keep your mouth shut.

613
00:39:46,033 --> 00:39:47,694
I don't know if I can do that.

614
00:39:47,935 --> 00:39:49,698
Fine. Thanks for your support.

615
00:39:50,805 --> 00:39:51,601
Come here.

616
00:40:00,081 --> 00:40:01,810
You plan to keep on practicing?

617
00:40:02,049 --> 00:40:04,210
I don't know.
I don't want my personal life...

618
00:40:04,452 --> 00:40:06,977
...spread around the hospital.
Is that asking too much?

619
00:40:07,221 --> 00:40:08,188
I don't know.

620
00:40:08,789 --> 00:40:09,756
Right.

621
00:40:16,430 --> 00:40:20,161
- We need to formalize chart review.
- Why would we wanna do that?

622
00:40:20,367 --> 00:40:21,356
Quality assurance.

623
00:40:21,602 --> 00:40:25,163
Residents can't improve their
diagnostic skills without feedback.

624
00:40:25,406 --> 00:40:29,035
Our Residents' diagnostic skills
are terrific the way they are.

625
00:40:29,310 --> 00:40:31,710
They need vacation, not supervision.

626
00:40:31,946 --> 00:40:34,141
- Good morning, everybody.
- Good morning.

627
00:40:34,381 --> 00:40:38,750
It's just a suggestion. We'll discuss
it at the Tuesday Attendings meeting.

628
00:40:38,986 --> 00:40:41,580
- What Tuesday Attendings meeting?
- Memo in your box.

629
00:40:41,822 --> 00:40:46,156
What's up with this board?
Is it gonna stay like this forever?

630
00:40:46,827 --> 00:40:47,851
No, it's not.

631
00:40:48,095 --> 00:40:52,225
Come on, Jerry. Let's put the
patients' last names back up here.

632
00:40:52,433 --> 00:40:55,561
And let's list their
complaints in English, please.

633
00:40:56,170 --> 00:40:58,730
Yes, I promise I'll give
him the message.

634
00:40:59,740 --> 00:41:01,207
Bye, now. Bye-bye.

635
00:41:01,475 --> 00:41:04,273
- Ross in yet? That girl called again.
- What girl?

636
00:41:04,512 --> 00:41:06,912
Every five minutes.
She's driving me crazy.

637
00:41:07,148 --> 00:41:08,911
Are you crazy, Randi?

638
00:41:09,150 --> 00:41:11,880
Gretchen's called 50 times.
It's not even 7 a.m.

639
00:41:12,119 --> 00:41:12,915
Thank you.

640
00:41:13,154 --> 00:41:16,146
Call her. I'm not your secretary.
I've got work to do.

641
00:41:16,390 --> 00:41:17,982
- Another stewardess?
- No.

642
00:41:18,225 --> 00:41:20,022
- Waitress?
- Hatcheck girl?

643
00:41:20,261 --> 00:41:22,286
You all think you know me so well.

644
00:41:22,530 --> 00:41:23,895
That's because we do.

645
00:41:24,098 --> 00:41:27,659
Gretchen's a mergers and acquisitions
specialist at First National.

646
00:41:27,902 --> 00:41:30,564
She went to Smith and Yale Law.

647
00:41:30,804 --> 00:41:32,396
She's a Rhodes scholar.

648
00:41:32,673 --> 00:41:36,700
Smith, wow! Most of the women
you date can't even spell "Smith."

649
00:41:37,711 --> 00:41:40,271
- I'm shocked.
- Well, I'm full of surprises.

650
00:41:40,548 --> 00:41:42,482
When do we meet
this Renaissance woman?

651
00:41:44,151 --> 00:41:45,118
A Rhodes scholar?

652
00:41:46,220 --> 00:41:47,687
Carter have a nice night?

653
00:41:47,922 --> 00:41:48,718
Oh, yeah.

654
00:41:48,956 --> 00:41:52,084
He'll fetch, heel, roll over
and play dead if you ask him.

655
00:41:52,326 --> 00:41:54,521
Doughnut?
I bought them for the nurses.

656
00:41:54,762 --> 00:41:57,356
Chocolate. Why, thank you, doctor.

657
00:41:57,565 --> 00:42:00,830
- Carter, come. I need you.
- Doughnut, Dr. Benton?

658
00:42:01,068 --> 00:42:05,300
Dr. Karubian said you woke him up
asking him how to work an oxygen mask.

659
00:42:05,539 --> 00:42:08,133
It was a little bit more
complicated than that.

660
00:42:08,409 --> 00:42:10,843
- Carter, where's your tie?
- Long story.

661
00:42:11,078 --> 00:42:13,444
- No time for that.
- Five flights?

662
00:42:13,681 --> 00:42:16,115
I hope you had
plenty of rest last night.

663
00:42:23,057 --> 00:42:26,117
- Gretchen, what are you doing?
- I've been calling you.

664
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:27,418
I've been busy.

665
00:42:27,661 --> 00:42:30,653
The store's doing inventory.
I hoped we could have lunch.

666
00:42:30,864 --> 00:42:32,855
Today I can't. I'm sorry.

667
00:42:36,670 --> 00:42:39,400
Listen, I gotta get back
to my patients, okay?

668
00:42:39,673 --> 00:42:41,197
Why don't you come over later?

669
00:42:41,475 --> 00:42:45,206
I don't wanna come over. I wanna
meet your friends, go to dinner.

670
00:42:45,446 --> 00:42:50,281
Listen to me. That's gonna happen.
Right now I gotta get back to work.

671
00:42:50,517 --> 00:42:51,984
When will it happen?

672
00:42:52,219 --> 00:42:54,710
Tonight we'll go to dinner.
7:00, all right?

673
00:42:55,322 --> 00:42:57,415
You pick the place. Okay?

674
00:42:58,659 --> 00:43:01,150
Okay, bye. I now have to
go to work, okay?

675
00:43:02,863 --> 00:43:04,125
I'll see you.

676
00:43:04,498 --> 00:43:05,624
- 7:00?
- Yeah, 7:00.

677
00:43:12,573 --> 00:43:13,767
Gretchen?

678
00:43:15,042 --> 00:43:19,274
No. She's just somebody
that I haven't seen in a long time.

679
00:43:23,117 --> 00:43:25,085
Jerry, don't you have
some work to do?

680
00:43:30,491 --> 00:43:32,857
Gretchen, hi. It's Doug.
You just left here.

681
00:43:33,093 --> 00:43:36,551
I'm sorry. I just realized I can't
have dinner with you tonight.

682
00:43:36,797 --> 00:43:40,198
I'm swamped, and I just forgot.
I'm sorry.

683
00:43:40,401 --> 00:43:44,599
I'll talk to you in a couple
of days, okay? Bye-bye.

684
00:44:17,171 --> 00:44:20,937
Someone left some sparklers
in the Trauma Room. You want them?

685
00:44:25,879 --> 00:44:29,576
I heard you caught another
central line. Any trouble?

686
00:44:29,817 --> 00:44:32,217
No, I hit it the first time.

687
00:44:32,453 --> 00:44:33,977
That's the way it is.

688
00:44:34,221 --> 00:44:38,954
Sometimes you can't find them.
Other times they are right there.

689
00:44:45,699 --> 00:44:48,259
I haven't seen one of these
since I was a kid.

690
00:44:53,607 --> 00:44:55,234
It's me. It's me.

691
00:44:55,509 --> 00:44:58,910
- You're a very popular guy.
- It's the ER.

692
00:44:59,146 --> 00:45:00,636
I'll go check it out.

693
00:45:01,582 --> 00:45:04,176
- Get some more fresh air.
- Thanks.

694
00:45:08,055 --> 00:45:10,649
Carter, how much longer you on?

695
00:45:10,891 --> 00:45:12,324
Two hours.

696
00:45:13,193 --> 00:45:14,421
You're gonna make it.
