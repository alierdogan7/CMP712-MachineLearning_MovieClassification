The_Libertine_(2004) ,HD_MKV_H264_AC3[5.1](WeinsteinCo,Eng,Sub) 1280x528

2
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:44,330
Allow me to be frank
at the commencement

3
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:49,890
You will not like me.

4
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:53,660
The gentlemen will be envious
and the ladies will be repelled.

5
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:57,930
You will not like me now and you will like me
a good deal less as we go on.

6
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:00,860
Ladies,

7
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:02,850
an announcement.

8
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:05,230
I am up for it.

9
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:07,170
All the time.

10
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:09,570
That is not a boast or an opinion.

11
00:02:09,610 --> 00:02:11,510
It is bone-hard medical fact.

12
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:13,410
I put it round, you know.

13
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:17,770
And you will watch me putting it round
and sigh for it.

14
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,580
Don't.

15
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:21,330
It is a deal of trouble for you

16
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:25,010
and you are better off watching and drawing
your conclusions from a distance

17
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:27,890
than you would be
if I got my tarse up your petticoats.

18
00:02:29,210 --> 00:02:31,100
Gentlemen,

19
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:33,020
do not despair.

20
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:35,010
I am up for that as well.

21
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:37,410
And the same warning applies.

22
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:41,010
Still your cheesy erections till I've had my say,

23
00:02:41,210 --> 00:02:43,890
but later when you shag,
and later you will shag,

24
00:02:44,090 --> 00:02:45,980
I shall expect it of you,

25
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:48,610
and I will know if you have let me down.

26
00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:51,130
I wish you to shag

27
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:55,170
with my homuncular image
rattling in your gonads.

28
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:57,500
Feel...

29
00:02:57,540 --> 00:02:59,690
how it was for me, how it is for me.

30
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:01,410
And ponder.

31
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:05,010
Was that shudder
the same shudder he sensed?

32
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:08,480
Did he know something more profound?

33
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:13,010
Or is there some wall of wretchedness
that we all batter with our heads

34
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:15,250
at that shining live-long moment?

35
00:03:17,210 --> 00:03:19,100
That is it.

36
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:20,890
That is my prologue.

37
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:22,810
Nothing in rhyme.

38
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:27,050
No protestations of modesty.
You were not expecting that, I hope.

39
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:29,180
I am John Wilmot.

40
00:03:29,210 --> 00:03:31,100
Second Earl of Rochester.

41
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:35,010
And I do not want you to like me.

42
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:55,010
MAN: Wren's upset. The clergy approved
the most conventional design for the cathedral.

43
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:58,090
Now he feels
there's no room for artistic manoeuvre.

44
00:03:58,130 --> 00:04:00,370
SECOND MAN:
Put a sub-clause in the warrant.

45
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:05,360
"Variations in the design
are to be ornamental rather than essential. "

46
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:07,650
Then he can do what he wants.

47
00:04:07,690 --> 00:04:09,500
Next.

48
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:13,080
MAN: There are representations for you
to be more careful in public.

49
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:15,260
Perhaps a bodyguard.

50
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:17,330
- Whose idea is that?
- Your brother.

51
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:19,100
Ha!

52
00:04:19,130 --> 00:04:22,760
No-one's going to kill me
if it means having him on the throne.

53
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:25,890
- Next.
- Danby says the army is costing too much.

54
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:28,010
It's Danby's job to balance the books.

55
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:32,130
If he thinks it's good economics to disband
the army and be invaded by the French,

56
00:04:32,170 --> 00:04:34,010
he can look for another position.

57
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:35,300
Anything else?

58
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:38,370
You asked me to remind you
about the Earl of Rochester.

59
00:04:38,690 --> 00:04:40,650
When did I banish him?

60
00:04:40,690 --> 00:04:42,500
Three months ago.

61
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:44,490
- For how long?
- A year.

62
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:48,130
Bring him back. Now.

63
00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:52,650
John.

64
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:57,610
Be attentive to your wife.
She's not accustomed to London.

65
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:02,370
Mother, I shall in all things
endeavour to serve her...

66
00:05:02,410 --> 00:05:04,170
and you.

67
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:10,130
Serve God.

68
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:28,930
You must not fear London.

69
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:32,130
It is not London I fear.

70
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:42,770
You abducted me in a coach like this
when I was still a virgin heiress.

71
00:05:42,810 --> 00:05:44,610
And did you like abduction?

72
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:48,450
Passionately.

73
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:53,250
Speak of it.

74
00:05:53,690 --> 00:05:56,050
John! This is not the place.

75
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:58,050
Speak to me of abduction.

76
00:05:58,090 --> 00:05:59,900
I was 18.

77
00:05:59,930 --> 00:06:02,290
And worth two and a half thousand a year.

78
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:05,530
You ambushed me,

79
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:07,650
bundled me from my coach,

80
00:06:07,690 --> 00:06:09,370
and drove me away.

81
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:18,050
The King thrust you in the tower for it.

82
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:21,570
And I dug in my heels
and spurned and shunned the other men.

83
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:27,370
I would only embrace my dear abductor.

84
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:19,370
Dryden's new play.

85
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:21,530
Here, Chas, grab a wodge.

86
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:23,650
Dryden couldn't write a laundry list.

87
00:07:24,930 --> 00:07:26,820
MAN: Rochester!

88
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:29,090
- Johnny!
- Johnny.

89
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:31,130
We were pining for you

90
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:32,890
Even now we're pining.

91
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:35,660
When I wake in the country,
I dream of being in London,

92
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:38,650
and then when I get here,
it's full of people like you.

93
00:07:38,690 --> 00:07:41,220
- Johnny.
- This reign's a shambles, do you not think?

94
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:45,650
My father risked life and limb
hiding that thing Charles up an oak tree.

95
00:07:45,930 --> 00:07:47,100
Has he forgiven you?

96
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:50,050
He's forgiven me. I shan't forgive him.

97
00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:52,730
Why did he banish you this time?

98
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:56,490
Well, it is a fine morning.
I'm walking through the galleries.

99
00:07:56,530 --> 00:08:00,010
The King is walking through the galleries.
I'm splendidly alone.

100
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:04,050
The King is surrounded
by a slow-moving troop...

101
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:06,850
.. of Mediterraneans.

102
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:10,250
- The wife's family.
- And he must make show of me.

103
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:14,090
Behold, the Earl of Rochester, the wit.

104
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:17,570
The poet. Pray, let us have some of your muse.

105
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:19,820
What am I to do?

106
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:23,930
Then I recall in my pocket I have
a sketch of something rustic with nymphs.

107
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:25,650
I pull it out and deliver.

108
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:32,690
"In the isle of Britain, long since famous grown
For breeding the best cunts in Christendom... "

109
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:37,680
Rat me, thinks I, this is not
the piece of paper I had supposed.

110
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:40,650
The King's eyes are more piercing
than I can remember.

111
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:44,780
The jaws of his entourage
are decidedly earthbound.

112
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:49,090
This piece of paper is not covered
merely with the thump and slop of congress.

113
00:08:49,130 --> 00:08:53,210
This poem is an attack on the monarchy itself.

114
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:57,730
Culminating in depiction of the royal mistress

115
00:08:57,770 --> 00:09:02,610
striving to flog the flaccid royal member
into a state of excitement.

116
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:08,730
"This you'd believe had I but time to tell you,
The pains it cost to poor laborious Nelly.

117
00:09:09,770 --> 00:09:12,810
Whilst she employs hands,
fingers, mouth and thighs,

118
00:09:13,130 --> 00:09:16,570
Ere she can raise the member she enjoys.

119
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:19,610
All monarchs I hate, and the thrones they sit on,

120
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:23,970
From the hector of France to the cully of Britain."

121
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:26,060
It's damn good, though, Johnny.

122
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:29,720
Course it's good. That's not the point.
The point is he couldn't appreciate it.

123
00:09:29,890 --> 00:09:33,220
It took me nearly an hour to write it,
just to please him.

124
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:37,490
Three months in the fucking country at the
height of the season. Missed all the good plays.

125
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:39,930
Boring old Rowley. We love you, Johnny.

126
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:42,770
Give us a stanza
and we'll laugh in the King's place.

127
00:09:42,810 --> 00:09:45,810
To Etherege, I drink a pledge.

128
00:09:46,010 --> 00:09:47,900
His life has run the gamut.

129
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:50,530
He's penned naught good
since She Would If She Could.

130
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:52,650
He would if he could but he cannot

131
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:57,010
Well, Johnny, it is a damn well said thing,
but it ain't true, do you see?

132
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:58,730
Oh, but it is true, Georgie.

133
00:09:59,130 --> 00:10:05,480
You think you can still enjoy the town's esteem
for something you wrote seven years ago.

134
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:07,600
You can't be promising for ever George

135
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:09,690
Sooner or later you must do something

136
00:10:10,010 --> 00:10:13,480
But that's what I'm saying.
Ihave written a new play.

137
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:15,330
Oh.

138
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:17,540
Written a new play has he?

139
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:24,210
All those afternoons he was pretending to slope
off and roger his mistress like a decent chap,

140
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:26,250
he was lurking in his rooms,

141
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:28,810
poking away at a play.

142
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:31,030
That is disgusting, George.

143
00:10:31,070 --> 00:10:33,210
Disgusting and shameful.

144
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:35,490
What's it about, your play?

145
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:36,980
A satire on Dryden?

146
00:10:37,010 --> 00:10:39,130
Pox o' Dryden. It's about you.

147
00:10:42,370 --> 00:10:44,730
And in your play, do you tell the truth about me?

148
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:47,580
- Well, I've attempted to show you...
- Yes?

149
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:50,770
- Well, I enjoy your company.
- You've made me endearing.

150
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:54,330
- Well, only the public can...
- Don't smarm around, George.

151
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:57,090
You're an endearing sort of... chap.

152
00:10:59,130 --> 00:11:01,090
So, you haven't told the truth.

153
00:11:01,130 --> 00:11:02,940
Good.

154
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:05,130
We don't want to go frightening people.

155
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:11,150
Now, how about a real play?

156
00:11:11,190 --> 00:11:13,090
The Duke's have the new Otway.

157
00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:17,810
Oh, I have high hopes of young Tom Otway.

158
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:24,450
Let me finish him off, sir.

159
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:29,480
This fellow is my servant. He has just filched
two shillings from my coat pocket.

160
00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:31,370
A thief and a rogue.

161
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:33,290
My lord you express i

162
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:36,810
Haven't quite got the hang of the reign yet,
have you?

163
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:39,050
- I will not employ a thief.
- Then I will.

164
00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:42,410
- How much was your master paying you?
- Six shillings a week, sir.

165
00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:44,510
Who talks of thieving?

166
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:46,380
George, give him ?5.

167
00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:50,040
Buy a brown livery and report to me
at the Duke's Theatre.

168
00:11:50,130 --> 00:11:51,490
He will steal your gold.

169
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:53,370
I hope so.

170
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:58,170
If he turned honest after coming into my orbit,
then I am not the malicious planet I had hoped.

171
00:11:58,210 --> 00:12:00,090
Now begone, sir.

172
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:11,850
- And er... how will your lordship be paying?
- Credit.

173
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:17,730
I only use coin vulgarised with the monarch's
head for transactions with servants.

174
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:19,370
I am ever your humble servant.

175
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:22,950
No, Mr Ratcliffe,
you are the very prince of drapery.

176
00:12:22,990 --> 00:12:26,200
The prince is always happy
to see the King's head.

177
00:12:26,230 --> 00:12:29,410
ROCHESTER:
But not to carry i around in his pocket

178
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:31,850
Credit then.

179
00:12:31,890 --> 00:12:33,690
Billy.

180
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:36,010
Join us.

181
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:37,920
Johnny.

182
00:12:38,130 --> 00:12:40,600
This is Billy Downs

183
00:12:41,780 --> 00:12:45,090
Billy this is the Earl of Rochester

184
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:49,650
How old are you, Mr Downs?

185
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:52,450
18, my lord.

186
00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:02,850
Young man, you will die of this company.

187
00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:05,410
Do not laugh. I'm serious.

188
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:13,290
Mr Ratcliffe, this hangs very well.

189
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:16,020
My lord, I saw you
just now with the gent's servant.

190
00:13:16,340 --> 00:13:18,700
Did you think I dispensed wisely in the matter?

191
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:22,810
If the fool run off with the gold,
then you prove a point, but at your loss.

192
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:27,650
If he return in your livery, then you've gained
a servant who is a known cheat.

193
00:13:27,690 --> 00:13:30,330
So you prove a different point,
but again at your own expense.

194
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:33,580
You summarise well, Mr Downs.

195
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:36,180
And in such a manner,
I deduce you were trained

196
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:40,610
at one of the "count the angels on a pinhead"
Cambridge colleges.

197
00:13:40,650 --> 00:13:42,450
King's, was it not?

198
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:44,650
It was, my lord.

199
00:13:44,690 --> 00:13:46,570
King's, yes.

200
00:13:46,580 --> 00:13:48,770
And yet you do not draw
the moral of the incident.

201
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:51,010
Which is?

202
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:56,080
That any experiment of interest in life will be
carried out at your own expense. Mark it well.

203
00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:03,730
MAN: My lord!

204
00:14:05,130 --> 00:14:07,200
My Lord Rochester.

205
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:09,170
You've come back.

206
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:11,410
In your livery, my lord.

207
00:14:11,420 --> 00:14:13,720
Then you are turned honest.
I cannot support that.

208
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:15,770
I regret the deed's honesty.

209
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:17,610
My lord.

210
00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:21,200
But I considered that if I performed it
and fell into your service,

211
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:24,170
I would have more... enjoyment of life.

212
00:14:26,420 --> 00:14:29,010
You see, this fellow has the hang of the reign.

213
00:14:29,050 --> 00:14:31,610
I like this fellow exceedingly.
What is your name?

214
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:32,840
Alcock.

215
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:37,200
Like master, like servant.

216
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:39,780
Well, Alcock,

217
00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:45,820
you shall drink and shag
more than any serving man in the kingdom.

218
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:50,210
Go at once and spend the rest of the money
on a whore, a large, greasy one.

219
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:52,560
Then when you are done, return here to me.

220
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:54,530
Now begone.

221
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:05,410
MAN: Rochester!
WOMAN: Disgrace!

222
00:15:05,450 --> 00:15:07,570
MAN: Rochester!

223
00:15:07,780 --> 00:15:10,730
Rochester! Missed you Lord Rochester!

224
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:13,570
He is risen!

225
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:18,300
My lord!

226
00:15:18,340 --> 00:15:19,610
WOMAN: My lord!

227
00:15:19,780 --> 00:15:21,730
MAN: Impertinent bastard!

228
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:36,130
MAN: Johnny!

229
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:38,690
My Lord Rochester!

230
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:45,250
Rochester you are a cunt sir!

231
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:48,210
WOMAN: I smell a rotten odour

232
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:53,770
I'll suck i for you Johnny
if you promise not to marry me!

233
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:15,290
WOMAN: Johnny said "cunt" to the King!

234
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:17,490
I'm going to brazen my arse at them.

235
00:16:17,530 --> 00:16:19,340
They've all seen it.

236
00:16:19,370 --> 00:16:21,930
Well, they can bloody well put up with it again.

237
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:25,330
WOMAN: Johnny said "cunt" to the King!

238
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:27,500
ALL: Johnny said "cunt" to the King.

239
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:29,890
Johnny said "cunt" to the King!

240
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:35,890
My lord.

241
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:38,130
Dear Jane.

242
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:44,330
Give you your first London spurt of the summer.

243
00:16:44,340 --> 00:16:47,010
- I brought the wife with me.
- Bit of a waste.

244
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:49,320
Shooting good jism up the lawful.

245
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:52,370
Ladies and gallants all,

246
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:54,650
the King!

247
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:12,770
Oh, freeze my piss,
if the royal finger ain't beckoning me.

248
00:17:12,810 --> 00:17:14,210
How exciting.

249
00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:31,550
Did you miss me?

250
00:17:31,590 --> 00:17:33,490
I missed the money.

251
00:17:33,530 --> 00:17:35,410
Good.

252
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:37,810
Don't like a whore with sentiment.

253
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:13,490
I could have ignored your poem, Johnny,
but I made a fuss about it for a reason.

254
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:15,620
I won't hide anything from you.

255
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:20,370
The country's on the brink.
People are still reeling from the fire, the plague.

256
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:23,890
The Catholics are plotting
the Dutch are a bunch of bastards

257
00:18:24,290 --> 00:18:27,050
and the French are ten times worse
and there's no money

258
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:31,460
I can only get funds by crawling to Parliament
or plotting against them.

259
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:35,530
And I don't want to lock antlers with them
head on in the way my father did.

260
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:38,010
"Head on?" That's quite good.

261
00:18:39,180 --> 00:18:43,330
When you first came to court Johnny
you were a boy of 18

262
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:47,490
A certain flippancy a whiff of impertinence

263
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:49,290
This was acceptable

264
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:52,970
But we're ten years down the road
and the view is different

265
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:55,460
The tone has to change.

266
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:58,210
I have to look responsible, sober.

267
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:01,090
I want you with me.

268
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:03,610
That's why I brought you back.

269
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:05,570
I want you to take on a new role.

270
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:08,410
Here? In the playhouse?

271
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:10,340
No, the House of Lords.

272
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:14,610
Your father spirited me out of England
when my life was at stake,

273
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:16,570
so I looked after him and after you.

274
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:19,330
- You put me in the Tower.
- And I let you out

275
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:21,730
The time has come for you to pay your dues.

276
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:24,810
People listen to you, Johnny.

277
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:29,280
If you took your seat in the Lords,
you could make great speeches

278
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:31,530
that would influence events.

279
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:35,780
Anyone can oppose.

280
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:37,700
It's fun to be against things.

281
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:41,360
But there comes a time when you have
to start being for things as well.

282
00:19:57,420 --> 00:19:59,370
Your Majesty.

283
00:20:03,180 --> 00:20:05,110
Mr Etherege.

284
00:20:05,150 --> 00:20:07,050
Take a nibble?

285
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:10,490
I've had my dinner, thank you, madam.

286
00:20:10,530 --> 00:20:12,290
George!

287
00:20:12,770 --> 00:20:14,810
ACTRESS: Is this thy plighted faih?

288
00:20:14,850 --> 00:20:16,710
Is this thy truth?

289
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:18,570
Oh too unkind!

290
00:20:19,010 --> 00:20:21,160
False and unconstant youth!

291
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:25,970
- Madam, believe not but my brother's just.
ROCHESTER: Who's she?

292
00:20:26,010 --> 00:20:27,690
She's Lizzie Barry.

293
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:29,540
And she just won't do.

294
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:32,140
You wrong his honour by this mean distrust.

295
00:20:32,290 --> 00:20:34,570
Well...

296
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:40,290
That does alleviate my griefs and give
my wearied soul a soft and kind reprieve.

297
00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:46,170
Which ever to forget would be
as hard and as impossible as to reward.

298
00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:49,330
Serving you my happiness secures.

299
00:20:51,980 --> 00:20:55,730
Since equally with yours my hopes are crossed.

300
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:04,360
Of all but sorry and sad despair.

301
00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:24,880
Lizzie. Lizzie!

302
00:21:30,740 --> 00:21:32,620
On stage.

303
00:21:32,660 --> 00:21:34,290
You must take your bow for the public.

304
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:37,410
Why do you persist in doing
the opposite of what you are told?

305
00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:42,210
If girls like you do not do what they are told,
then it is all up with our sex on the stage.

306
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:46,210
You cannot ignore the advice
of them that know!

307
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:47,610
Now, acknowledge your audience.

308
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:50,690
They can kiss my arse.

309
00:21:58,100 --> 00:22:00,050
She's a good fuck, but she costs.

310
00:22:02,420 --> 00:22:05,850
She gives a nice gobble,
but she won't do the full wibbly-wobbly.

311
00:22:05,890 --> 00:22:07,650
- She does it with me.
- She does not!

312
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:10,000
Mary, if I may say so...

313
00:22:12,980 --> 00:22:14,730
.. a statuesque performance.

314
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:16,330
Bursting with Grecian promise.

315
00:22:18,740 --> 00:22:22,250
Mrs Barry, the work we did beforehand,
did it mean nothing to you?

316
00:22:22,290 --> 00:22:24,050
That is correct, Mr Harris.

317
00:22:24,340 --> 00:22:28,120
Molly, I cannot teach those
who will not be disposed to learn.

318
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:30,530
- Mr Etherege, how do you do, sir?
- Well, Mr Harris.

319
00:22:30,580 --> 00:22:33,450
- Was not my Lord Rochester in wih you?
- Darted off

320
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:35,150
Did you care for the play?

321
00:22:35,190 --> 00:22:36,850
The play was well enough.

322
00:22:37,290 --> 00:22:39,760
Most of the acting, too.

323
00:22:50,250 --> 00:22:52,210
Mrs Barry.

324
00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:55,090
MOLLY: She has been dismissed.

325
00:22:55,530 --> 00:22:57,420
I bring word from Mr Betterton.

326
00:22:57,460 --> 00:23:00,810
- I've had such already.
- This is quite another.

327
00:23:08,290 --> 00:23:10,230
You have obtained a reprieve for me.

328
00:23:10,270 --> 00:23:12,170
Yes, madam, but there is a price.

329
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:21,440
This is your first season on the London stage.

330
00:23:21,740 --> 00:23:23,290
It is, my lord.

331
00:23:23,330 --> 00:23:25,060
Mrs Barry,

332
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:28,640
you must acquire the trick
of ignoring those who do not like you.

333
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:34,210
In my experience, those who do not like you fall
into two categories, the stupid and the envious.

334
00:23:34,220 --> 00:23:38,210
The stupid will like you in five years' time,
the envious never.

335
00:23:38,530 --> 00:23:40,900
Wih my training you will become the best

336
00:23:40,940 --> 00:23:43,890
the most fascinating actress
on the London stage

337
00:23:44,770 --> 00:23:46,920
I shall come to the theatre tomorrow.

338
00:23:49,580 --> 00:23:52,900
What are you up to, Johnny? She can't act.

339
00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:55,970
She has neither the cadence of the heroic
nor the posture.

340
00:23:56,300 --> 00:24:00,930
I will wager you 20 guineas she will become
the finest actress on our stage.

341
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:03,560
This is the prick talking, not the head.

342
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:05,330
Knob her and have done.

343
00:24:05,620 --> 00:24:07,020
Is it a wager?

344
00:24:07,060 --> 00:24:09,330
My dear friend, you do not have 20 guineas.

345
00:24:09,460 --> 00:24:10,860
Is it a wager?

346
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:12,890
We've missed the fuck. Can we get a drink?

347
00:24:13,140 --> 00:24:16,530
There's a new toping house hard by
called Deaf Marion's.

348
00:24:16,770 --> 00:24:19,970
The Cambridge boy knows his books by heart.

349
00:24:20,140 --> 00:24:22,090
Lead on, King's.

350
00:24:33,580 --> 00:24:35,530
Alcock.

351
00:24:35,980 --> 00:24:37,730
My lord.

352
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:39,970
Something rotten has got into my guts.

353
00:24:40,770 --> 00:24:42,530
I trust it's not me, my lord.

354
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:45,610
No, Alcock, it is not. Not yet.

355
00:24:46,660 --> 00:24:49,290
We should mark the front lawn at Adderbury
for pall-mall.

356
00:24:49,330 --> 00:24:50,930
I had always thought it a foolish game.

357
00:24:50,980 --> 00:24:52,730
Depends on who you play with.

358
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:55,730
The King plays with a common prostitute,
not his wife.

359
00:24:55,770 --> 00:24:58,930
The Portuguese
have little flair for outdoor pursuits.

360
00:24:59,140 --> 00:25:01,370
Except navigating, of course.

361
00:25:01,530 --> 00:25:03,890
I mean that the etiquette of it is singular.

362
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:06,780
I know what you mean.

363
00:25:06,820 --> 00:25:09,380
You must always be
ace, king and jack, my dear.

364
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:12,050
But heaven has not disposed your cards so.

365
00:25:12,140 --> 00:25:14,010
ETHEREGE: Johnny! It's your shot!

366
00:25:14,250 --> 00:25:15,660
I'm not playing!

367
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:18,030
Oh, but you are, John.

368
00:25:18,070 --> 00:25:20,370
You are if I say you are.

369
00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:31,060
The most advanced scientific instrument
in western Europe.

370
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:35,610
It cost ?60000
It tells the time in every corner of the globe

371
00:25:36,820 --> 00:25:38,770
Understand?

372
00:25:39,140 --> 00:25:41,020
That is achievement.

373
00:25:41,060 --> 00:25:45,090
The man who did that was not continually pissed
for the last three years.

374
00:25:45,140 --> 00:25:47,330
What do you want from me?

375
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:52,730
Writing something profound
that will stand as a monument to my reign.

376
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:55,050
You're my literary giant.

377
00:25:55,090 --> 00:25:56,900
Dryden? Plodder.

378
00:25:56,940 --> 00:25:58,730
But look what he's achieved.

379
00:25:58,770 --> 00:26:00,530
Elizabeth had her Shakespeare.

380
00:26:00,770 --> 00:26:02,730
You can be mine.

381
00:26:03,010 --> 00:26:07,010
Give me a major work of literature
and I'll give you 500 guineas.

382
00:26:07,820 --> 00:26:10,330
When would you like it? Friday?

383
00:26:11,740 --> 00:26:13,690
Don't fuck it up, John.

384
00:26:13,730 --> 00:26:15,610
I love you.

385
00:26:26,660 --> 00:26:28,610
Mrs Barry!

386
00:26:28,980 --> 00:26:31,850
I cannot let you have long.
I must prepare Tamburlaine.

387
00:26:31,890 --> 00:26:33,610
There's a great deal of setting up

388
00:26:34,060 --> 00:26:34,980
Mrs Barry.

389
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:36,970
.. and a deal of taking down.

390
00:26:40,250 --> 00:26:42,020
My Lord Rochester.

391
00:26:42,060 --> 00:26:43,890
I'm come as I said I would.

392
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:45,850
Will you have me lift my skirt?

393
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:49,530
Or do you have a mind
to raise it by your own endeavours?

394
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:53,970
I'm come to train you... in your acting.

395
00:26:54,010 --> 00:26:55,530
So you said when we first met,

396
00:26:55,530 --> 00:26:59,080
but your reputation being what it is,
I thought you meant something different.

397
00:26:59,250 --> 00:27:01,210
I have, I hope, many reputations.

398
00:27:01,460 --> 00:27:03,650
I am come, I say, to train you...

399
00:27:03,690 --> 00:27:05,890
in your stage acting

400
00:27:06,250 --> 00:27:09,100
Never in my life
have I heard you spoken of as an actor.

401
00:27:09,140 --> 00:27:12,290
That does not deter me
from spreading my insights to others

402
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:15,330
- I thought it would not.
- Then we shall begin

403
00:27:16,620 --> 00:27:18,980
You are familiar with the plays of Mr Etherege?

404
00:27:19,010 --> 00:27:21,610
- There are but two my lord
- Not for long, I fear.

405
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:24,250
The Comical Revenge or Love In A Tub

406
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:27,130
Have you seen Mrs Betterton playing Graciana?

407
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:28,770
Yes, I'm her understudy.

408
00:27:28,770 --> 00:27:30,730
Indeed.

409
00:27:31,060 --> 00:27:33,070
Act Two, Scene Two.

410
00:27:33,110 --> 00:27:35,090
I shall play Beaufort.

411
00:27:35,380 --> 00:27:37,210
Graciana, why do you condemn your love?

412
00:27:37,380 --> 00:27:41,000
Your beauty without that, alas,
would prove but my destruction.

413
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:44,890
An unlucky star
prognosticating ruin and despair.

414
00:27:45,220 --> 00:27:46,620
You mistake.

415
00:27:46,660 --> 00:27:49,610
'Tis not my love I blame, but my discretion.

416
00:27:50,010 --> 00:27:53,450
Here the active flame should yet
a longer time have been concealed.

417
00:27:53,490 --> 00:27:56,350
Too soon too soon I fear i was revealed

418
00:27:56,380 --> 00:27:59,210
Our weaker sex glories in surprise.

419
00:27:59,420 --> 00:28:02,170
We boast the sudden conquests of our eyes.

420
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:05,180
But men esteem a foe that dares contend

421
00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:08,300
One that with noble courage
does defend a wounded heart.

422
00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:11,960
The victories they gain, they prize
by their own hazard and their pain.

423
00:28:12,060 --> 00:28:15,090
That was not Elizabeth Barry.
That was Mrs Betterton.

424
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:18,140
LIZZIE: An understudy must imiate not create

425
00:28:18,180 --> 00:28:20,610
- Yesterday you created
- Yesterday I was dismissed.

426
00:28:20,980 --> 00:28:24,210
- But you played truthfully
- It costs too much to play the truth.

427
00:28:24,340 --> 00:28:26,690
I do not think
you have considered this speech at all

428
00:28:26,740 --> 00:28:28,690
Well, how would you have me do it?

429
00:28:31,060 --> 00:28:33,010
Let us consider now.

430
00:28:33,940 --> 00:28:37,260
What does it mean, that speech
that Mrs Betterton mangled so?

431
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:41,450
Graciana means that she has given away
the secrets of her heart too freely.

432
00:28:41,660 --> 00:28:44,410
Something that a gentlewoman
must not do to a gentleman.

433
00:28:44,540 --> 00:28:46,890
- Why not?
- Because men will take love for granted

434
00:28:46,940 --> 00:28:48,290
and then not prize it.

435
00:28:49,340 --> 00:28:51,700
And is our author right? Do you believe that?

436
00:28:51,740 --> 00:28:54,810
I believe men are hurdles
that must be negotiated.

437
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:57,770
Is that all? Do you never feel passion for us?

438
00:28:57,980 --> 00:29:01,570
I've counterfeited passion in gentlemen's beds
if that is your meaning.

439
00:29:01,610 --> 00:29:03,770
Counterfei will not serve you on the stage

440
00:29:04,220 --> 00:29:07,090
Yesterday I was jeered and taunted
by 400 ruffians.

441
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:08,850
I know that will not serve me.

442
00:29:09,010 --> 00:29:12,930
And so you will take their word against both
of ours and traffic in falsehood from now on?

443
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:14,700
I don't know

444
00:29:14,740 --> 00:29:17,250
Then let us gain knowledge.
To the speech again.

445
00:29:18,740 --> 00:29:20,620
You played i sweetly

446
00:29:20,660 --> 00:29:24,530
Graciana is not innocent
or she would not have such insight

447
00:29:26,420 --> 00:29:28,300
If you had ever loved a man

448
00:29:28,340 --> 00:29:30,710
you would say that speech wih regret

449
00:29:30,750 --> 00:29:33,090
Because you would fear the loss of him.

450
00:29:33,140 --> 00:29:35,090
And supposing I have loved?

451
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:38,450
Then show me in the speech.

452
00:29:39,980 --> 00:29:42,810
Sir, you mistake.

453
00:29:43,820 --> 00:29:45,450
'Tis not my love I blame.

454
00:29:45,740 --> 00:29:47,620
But my discretion.

455
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:51,810
Here the active flame should yet
a longer time have been concealed.

456
00:29:51,980 --> 00:29:54,820
Too soon, too soon I fear it was revealed.

457
00:29:54,860 --> 00:29:59,450
Our weaker sex glories in surprise.
We boast the sudden conquests of our eyes.

458
00:29:59,660 --> 00:30:02,490
But men esteem a foe that dares contend.

459
00:30:02,660 --> 00:30:05,810
One that with noble courage
does defend a wounded heart.

460
00:30:05,940 --> 00:30:09,890
The victories they gain, they prize
by their own hazard and their pain.

461
00:30:09,930 --> 00:30:11,730
Well?

462
00:30:12,180 --> 00:30:13,930
Was there improvement?

463
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:15,370
Did you think so?

464
00:30:15,540 --> 00:30:17,490
I wish to know your thoughts.

465
00:30:20,340 --> 00:30:21,970
It was better.

466
00:30:22,250 --> 00:30:23,660
But now you're too angry.

467
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:27,370
Of course I'm fucking angry! You walk
into this theatre in your 30-shilling boots

468
00:30:27,540 --> 00:30:30,650
telling me how I should set about my work!
I warn you, I have a temper.

469
00:30:30,780 --> 00:30:33,730
And I have been known to strike out
with the first object at hand.

470
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:38,090
If that be a property blade, some have
sharper edges than is needful, so have a care.

471
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:40,050
Ahhh.

472
00:30:40,250 --> 00:30:42,930
To die onstage
at the hands of a beautiful woman.

473
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:44,610
I am no such!

474
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:50,330
I think I can make you an actress of truth,
not a creature of artifice.

475
00:30:50,340 --> 00:30:52,220
I can do this.

476
00:30:52,250 --> 00:30:55,490
But I cannot train you
unless you give a little towards me.

477
00:30:58,980 --> 00:31:00,930
It's not in my nature to give.

478
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:03,740
I have my talent and I'm jealous of it.

479
00:31:03,780 --> 00:31:08,130
And though I give you credit that you
and you alone in all the town have seen it,

480
00:31:08,580 --> 00:31:12,770
I am not so dazzled by the lord and master
in you that I cannot resent you.

481
00:31:14,340 --> 00:31:15,890
Yes.

482
00:31:16,250 --> 00:31:17,660
You are right.

483
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:21,240
I am intent on doing something
that no other has yet done.

484
00:31:21,540 --> 00:31:24,410
And I lost my purpose yesterday
with fear of the pit.

485
00:31:24,420 --> 00:31:26,300
But I will conquer them.

486
00:31:26,340 --> 00:31:29,930
And it shall not be said
when I have my fame and my ?2 a week

487
00:31:30,180 --> 00:31:34,290
that Lord Rochester took to me and touched me
with the shining wing of his genius

488
00:31:34,330 --> 00:31:37,250
and so turned me
into a little corner of his greatness. No!

489
00:31:37,380 --> 00:31:41,130
I shall be valued for me
and for what I knew I could do upon this stage!

490
00:31:41,220 --> 00:31:45,250
And for what I, Lizzie Barry... how I...
I took the heat of my own soul and moulded it

491
00:31:45,540 --> 00:31:48,370
and turned it into a wondrous thing
and so triumphed.

492
00:31:49,860 --> 00:31:51,810
If I can help you to that triumph,

493
00:31:52,250 --> 00:31:56,530
I'm not so devoted to the trumpeting of
my own works that I would wish to take credit.

494
00:31:56,580 --> 00:31:58,130
So you say now.

495
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:03,060
But in the ale house, when the play is done,
and the talk is of my Cleopatra,

496
00:32:03,100 --> 00:32:07,130
will you not glide towards your cronies
with a "I taught her that piece of business"

497
00:32:07,420 --> 00:32:11,290
or "She could not be heard in the gallery
until I instructed her in a trick or two"?

498
00:32:11,330 --> 00:32:13,010
Madam I offer my services

499
00:32:13,060 --> 00:32:17,410
If you see no advantage in them,
they can as easy be withdrawn.

500
00:32:17,620 --> 00:32:20,450
You could buy my slit for a pound a night, sir.

501
00:32:21,460 --> 00:32:23,340
I would not mind that.

502
00:32:23,380 --> 00:32:25,810
But I think you would not have it so.

503
00:32:26,740 --> 00:32:30,810
What I think you want is power over me,
which I do bridle at.

504
00:32:31,060 --> 00:32:33,490
For it is only I who can do what you say I can do.

505
00:32:34,460 --> 00:32:37,730
If you wish to play a part in this
I would strongly know why

506
00:32:38,780 --> 00:32:41,210
Ask yourself what you want from the theatre.

507
00:32:41,660 --> 00:32:44,020
I want the passionate love of my audience

508
00:32:44,060 --> 00:32:47,410
I want when I make a sweep of my arm
to carry their hearts away.

509
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:51,250
And for when I die, for them
to sigh for never seeing me again.

510
00:32:51,250 --> 00:32:53,400
Till the next afternoon.

511
00:32:54,620 --> 00:32:56,570
There is your answer.

512
00:32:57,500 --> 00:33:00,410
I want to be one of that multitude.

513
00:33:02,780 --> 00:33:04,730
I wish to be moved.

514
00:33:06,140 --> 00:33:08,020
I cannot feel in life.

515
00:33:08,060 --> 00:33:11,210
I must have others do it
for me here in the theatre.

516
00:33:12,420 --> 00:33:15,330
You are spoken of as a man
with a stomach for life.

517
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:17,860
I am the cynic of our golden age.

518
00:33:18,660 --> 00:33:22,130
This bounteous dish,
which our great Charles and our great God

519
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:27,930
have, more or less in equal measure, placed
before us, sets my teeth permanently on edge.

520
00:33:30,660 --> 00:33:34,200
Life has no purpose.
It is everywhere undone by arbitrariness.

521
00:33:34,340 --> 00:33:37,210
I do this and it matters not a jot
if I do the opposite.

522
00:33:38,180 --> 00:33:40,130
But in a playhouse,

523
00:33:40,580 --> 00:33:44,380
every action, good or bad,
has its consequences.

524
00:33:44,420 --> 00:33:47,530
Drop a handkerchief
and it will return to smother you.

525
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:52,180
The theatre is my drug.

526
00:33:52,220 --> 00:33:57,690
And my illness is so far advanced
that my physic must be of the highest quality.

527
00:34:00,380 --> 00:34:02,330
Oh, my lord,

528
00:34:03,740 --> 00:34:07,730
on those conditions,
I endeavour to do what you want.

529
00:34:11,420 --> 00:34:16,090
What I want is that we meet again tomorrow
to consider Ophelia.

530
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:18,170
Ophelia?

531
00:34:19,570 --> 00:34:23,450
Mr Betterton will revive Hamlet next month
and you will play Ophelia.

532
00:34:25,340 --> 00:34:27,290
Ophelia then if you wish.

533
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:32,090
But let us not neglect
the lesson in Mr Etherege's speech.

534
00:34:32,530 --> 00:34:34,490
And what is that?

535
00:34:35,420 --> 00:34:38,770
That women
should ever view men with suspicion.

536
00:34:42,610 --> 00:34:45,220
I shall be happy to return and address our work

537
00:34:45,260 --> 00:34:49,650
with that instruction
written on the inside of my skull.

538
00:34:56,940 --> 00:35:00,090
- Do me now.
JANE: How?

539
00:35:00,380 --> 00:35:02,330
Mouth.

540
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:20,430
Trembling,

541
00:35:20,470 --> 00:35:22,370
confused,

542
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:25,250
despairing, limber,

543
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:27,450
dry,

544
00:35:28,570 --> 00:35:30,330
A wishing, weak,

545
00:35:30,980 --> 00:35:32,930
unmoving lump I lie.

546
00:35:35,780 --> 00:35:37,530
This...

547
00:35:38,660 --> 00:35:40,410
.. dart of love,

548
00:35:40,570 --> 00:35:42,530
whose piercing point, oft tried,

549
00:35:43,460 --> 00:35:46,650
With virgin blood 10,000 maids have dyed,

550
00:35:48,260 --> 00:35:52,090
Now languid lies in this unhappy hour.

551
00:35:53,050 --> 00:35:55,010
Shrunk up...

552
00:35:55,940 --> 00:35:57,820
.. and sapless,

553
00:35:57,860 --> 00:35:59,890
like a withered flower.

554
00:36:01,420 --> 00:36:04,370
I have a feeling this is going nowhere

555
00:36:04,780 --> 00:36:06,730
I have that feeling, too.

556
00:36:07,660 --> 00:36:09,610
I've met this woman.

557
00:36:10,530 --> 00:36:12,680
Lizzie Barry

558
00:36:12,820 --> 00:36:14,770
That new actress?

559
00:36:15,140 --> 00:36:18,340
- She ain't no looker
- There is spirit in her.

560
00:36:18,380 --> 00:36:21,410
When a gent sees the spirit
and not the eyes or the tits,

561
00:36:21,570 --> 00:36:23,530
then a gent is in trouble

562
00:36:26,380 --> 00:36:28,260
Would you call me a cynic, Jane?

563
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:32,730
I'd call you a man who pretends
to like life more than he does.

564
00:36:34,900 --> 00:36:36,650
Is that a cynic?

565
00:36:36,820 --> 00:36:39,380
I'm just a moll-sack I don't do questions

566
00:36:42,570 --> 00:36:44,530
If I am a cynic,

567
00:36:45,460 --> 00:36:51,050
how have I fallen in love with a plain woman,
whom I do not know?

568
00:36:51,220 --> 00:36:53,100
You saw her on stage.

569
00:36:53,140 --> 00:36:56,530
All the colours and them poems they say.

570
00:36:56,980 --> 00:36:58,770
Gives them a glow

571
00:36:59,860 --> 00:37:02,490
- You've seen her out of the theatre?
- No.

572
00:37:02,740 --> 00:37:04,770
Well, then it's not her. It's the theatre.

573
00:37:04,810 --> 00:37:06,610
That or

574
00:37:07,530 --> 00:37:09,410
Or what?

575
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:14,250
They say men fall three times.

576
00:37:15,660 --> 00:37:17,540
First is calf love.

577
00:37:17,570 --> 00:37:19,610
Second is the one you marry.

578
00:37:21,420 --> 00:37:23,370
And third?

579
00:37:23,820 --> 00:37:25,370
Third

580
00:37:27,180 --> 00:37:29,130
Third is your deathbed bride.

581
00:37:30,050 --> 00:37:32,810
You sniff her, you sniff your own shroud.

582
00:37:32,940 --> 00:37:34,820
Ah.

583
00:37:34,860 --> 00:37:37,160
How you have cheered me.

584
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:40,580
Go home and sleep.

585
00:37:40,610 --> 00:37:43,090
- I don't want to sleep.
- Then go home and think.

586
00:37:43,130 --> 00:37:45,570
- I don't ever want to think again.
- John.

587
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:47,780
Don't make me care for you.

588
00:37:47,820 --> 00:37:52,170
I'd rather you came your fetch over my face
than leave me with that,

589
00:37:53,090 --> 00:37:55,050
a lump of caring.

590
00:37:58,380 --> 00:38:00,330
Now go home and forget.

591
00:38:12,610 --> 00:38:15,850
ROCHESTER:
Much wine had passed wih grave discourse

592
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:18,290
Of who fucks who and who does worse

593
00:38:19,820 --> 00:38:24,990
When I who still take care to see
Drunkenness relieved by lechery

594
00:38:25,030 --> 00:38:30,170
Went out into St James's Park
To cool my head and fire my heart

595
00:38:31,420 --> 00:38:36,890
But though St James has the honour on't
'Tis consecrate to prick and cunt

596
00:38:37,010 --> 00:38:44,810
There by a most incestuous birth
Strange woods spring from the teeming earth

597
00:38:46,140 --> 00:38:55,250
And nightly now beneath their shade
Are buggeries rapes and incests made

598
00:39:46,610 --> 00:39:48,570
Mr Huysmans.

599
00:39:49,980 --> 00:39:54,330
Perhaps a bottle and a glass would be
handsome adornments to your composition?

600
00:39:54,370 --> 00:39:57,840
They are not appropriate objects
in a family portrait, my lord.

601
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:09,620
Mr Huysmans, here is another thought.

602
00:40:09,660 --> 00:40:12,220
You see that monkey yonder
dancing to the fiddle?

603
00:40:12,530 --> 00:40:15,810
Can't help but notice
how human these creatures are

604
00:40:16,860 --> 00:40:20,640
I would sit that monkey
on a pile of solemn volumes,

605
00:40:21,180 --> 00:40:25,930
and place in her hand a scrap of paper as if
it were a poem she'd just written, do you see?

606
00:40:25,980 --> 00:40:33,450
And while she is offering the poem to me,
I am crowning her with the bays.

607
00:40:35,530 --> 00:40:39,650
I find Lady Rochester
a more elegant and interesting subject.

608
00:40:39,740 --> 00:40:42,100
You are wide of the point, sir.

609
00:40:42,140 --> 00:40:45,250
Elegance, interest, all very well in their way.

610
00:40:45,500 --> 00:40:47,210
But what do they illuminate?

611
00:40:47,300 --> 00:40:49,760
Am I not then an apt partner for you to sit with?

612
00:40:49,860 --> 00:40:51,900
You are apt, Elizabeth. You are very apt.

613
00:40:51,940 --> 00:40:54,010
But you would rather be painted with a monkey?

614
00:40:54,140 --> 00:40:56,490
It is of a muchness.

615
00:40:56,660 --> 00:40:59,650
You are both apt in your different ways.

616
00:40:59,700 --> 00:41:04,530
In this portrait I am no better than a monkey
who knows the names of his ancestors.

617
00:41:04,700 --> 00:41:07,000
And I?

618
00:41:09,260 --> 00:41:13,730
A gaudy female monkey,
gloating over the opulence of your cage.

619
00:41:23,220 --> 00:41:25,170
I love London.

620
00:41:26,090 --> 00:41:28,650
Everyone catches its generous spirit so quickly.

621
00:41:28,980 --> 00:41:30,730
Indeed.

622
00:41:31,860 --> 00:41:35,210
I do not mean to upset people, Alcock,
but I have to speak my mind,

623
00:41:35,220 --> 00:41:37,600
because what is in my mind
is always more interesting

624
00:41:37,620 --> 00:41:40,410
than what is happening
in the world outside my mind.

625
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:43,250
Makes you impossible to live with, though,
do you see?

626
00:41:46,740 --> 00:41:49,090
Did I once praise you for your blunt manner?

627
00:41:50,090 --> 00:41:52,450
It was your reason for employing me.

628
00:41:54,420 --> 00:41:58,120
It could as easy be your grounds for dismissal.

629
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:01,290
Now, get me the monkey.

630
00:42:22,260 --> 00:42:24,210
John.

631
00:42:25,620 --> 00:42:29,490
John, I could bear our marriage more easily
if there were no pretence.

632
00:42:31,380 --> 00:42:34,850
If I were merely a housekeeper
and a conduit for the noble line.

633
00:42:36,180 --> 00:42:40,050
But when you're away you write
so beguilingly of how you love me and...

634
00:42:41,940 --> 00:42:43,820
.. I do not think you mean to torture me,

635
00:42:43,860 --> 00:42:46,530
but it is a torture
to be informed of passion from a distance

636
00:42:46,740 --> 00:42:48,770
and then in the flesh to be so reviled.

637
00:42:50,570 --> 00:42:53,670
You know I always mean to be well
when we are together,

638
00:42:53,700 --> 00:42:56,770
but after a few weeks, I find I have no gift for it.

639
00:42:58,260 --> 00:43:00,450
In my mind I am somewhere else.

640
00:43:01,620 --> 00:43:04,650
Then cut me out of your heart completely
and have done.

641
00:43:04,980 --> 00:43:07,730
Do not command me to do something
beyond my power.

642
00:43:08,820 --> 00:43:11,350
Is the fault mine? If I were a better wife...

643
00:43:11,390 --> 00:43:13,890
would you not need
the whorehouse and the inn?

644
00:43:14,090 --> 00:43:16,450
Every man needs the whorehouse and the inn.

645
00:43:17,460 --> 00:43:21,810
But it's not the inn or a whore that I see
in your eyes. It's some other creature.

646
00:43:23,220 --> 00:43:25,170
The playhouse.

647
00:43:28,980 --> 00:43:30,930
An actress.

648
00:43:32,820 --> 00:43:36,440
And when your eyes shone the other day,
they were shining for her.

649
00:43:39,050 --> 00:43:41,010
They were.

650
00:43:44,820 --> 00:43:48,360
I see I am more of an obstacle
to your London life than I supposed.

651
00:43:50,570 --> 00:43:52,530
I'll be gone by the morning.

652
00:44:04,980 --> 00:44:06,930
My lord.

653
00:44:13,700 --> 00:44:15,650
How is Ophelia in this scene?

654
00:44:17,050 --> 00:44:19,370
Well, she's mad. She's out of her wits.

655
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:21,690
There are many ways to be out of your wits.

656
00:44:22,820 --> 00:44:24,370
Yes.

657
00:44:24,740 --> 00:44:26,690
Well, there's grief.

658
00:44:26,730 --> 00:44:28,630
And drink.

659
00:44:28,660 --> 00:44:30,560
And love.

660
00:44:30,590 --> 00:44:32,450
So I hear.

661
00:44:32,900 --> 00:44:36,250
These different states,
how would you show them?

662
00:44:36,260 --> 00:44:38,210
Show them?

663
00:44:39,140 --> 00:44:41,090
Their physical manifestation.

664
00:44:44,420 --> 00:44:46,130
Close your eyes.

665
00:44:48,740 --> 00:44:50,690
Close your eyes.

666
00:45:18,380 --> 00:45:21,130
LIZZIE:
O what a noble mind is here o'erthrown

667
00:45:21,180 --> 00:45:24,850
The courtier's soldier's scholar's
eye tongue sword and I

668
00:45:25,010 --> 00:45:26,450
Again.

669
00:45:26,460 --> 00:45:28,690
O, what a noble mind is here o'erthrown.

670
00:45:29,780 --> 00:45:32,450
- The courtier's, soldier's...
- Again.

671
00:45:33,940 --> 00:45:38,290
O, what a noble mind is here o'erthrown.
The courtier's, soldier's, scholar's, eye...

672
00:45:38,330 --> 00:45:39,610
Again.

673
00:45:39,700 --> 00:45:41,930
- Eye tongue sword
- Again!

674
00:45:41,980 --> 00:45:45,130
- O, what a noble mind is here o'erthrown.
ECHO: is here o'erthrown

675
00:45:45,160 --> 00:45:46,970
The courtier's, soldier's, scholar's...

676
00:45:46,980 --> 00:45:48,930
- Again.
- What was wrong?

677
00:45:49,380 --> 00:45:51,740
You know what was wrong. Again.

678
00:45:51,780 --> 00:45:54,770
She has done this speech
20 times this afternoon.

679
00:45:55,090 --> 00:45:56,770
And she will do it 20 more.

680
00:45:57,010 --> 00:46:00,210
MOLLY: No-one has worked like this
in the history of the theatre

681
00:46:00,250 --> 00:46:03,370
- Exactly.
- O what a noble mind is here o'erthrown

682
00:46:04,700 --> 00:46:07,770
The courtier's, soldier's, scholar's,
eye, tongue, sword...

683
00:46:09,980 --> 00:46:11,860
and I

684
00:46:11,900 --> 00:46:13,970
of ladies most deject and wretched

685
00:46:14,780 --> 00:46:17,570
that sucked the honey of his music vows

686
00:47:14,780 --> 00:47:18,730
O, what a noble mind is here o'erthrown.

687
00:47:20,050 --> 00:47:21,940
The courtier's,

688
00:47:21,980 --> 00:47:23,930
soldier's, scholar's,

689
00:47:23,970 --> 00:47:25,850
eye, tongue,

690
00:47:26,300 --> 00:47:28,250
sword,

691
00:47:29,180 --> 00:47:31,060
and I,

692
00:47:31,100 --> 00:47:34,050
of ladies most deject and wretched

693
00:47:35,900 --> 00:47:39,650
that sucked the honey of his music vows

694
00:47:42,180 --> 00:47:44,130
O, woe is me.

695
00:47:46,500 --> 00:47:48,450
To see what I have seen.

696
00:47:49,860 --> 00:47:51,810
O, see what I see.

697
00:47:52,740 --> 00:47:56,130
And there's some fennel for you
and columbine.

698
00:47:56,160 --> 00:47:58,050
And there's rue for you.

699
00:48:01,380 --> 00:48:03,330
And here's some for me.

700
00:48:06,660 --> 00:48:10,410
We may call it herb of grace o' Sundays.

701
00:48:17,700 --> 00:48:22,210
O, you must wear your rue with a difference.

702
00:48:26,820 --> 00:48:28,770
LIZZIE: He is gone

703
00:48:28,810 --> 00:48:30,690
He is gone

704
00:48:33,050 --> 00:48:34,940
And we...

705
00:48:34,980 --> 00:48:36,770
cast away, moan.

706
00:48:37,860 --> 00:48:39,810
God have mercy on his soul

707
00:48:41,700 --> 00:48:43,850
And of all ye Christian souls

708
00:48:43,880 --> 00:48:46,000
No-one likes a clever bastard.

709
00:48:47,460 --> 00:48:49,410
I pray God

710
00:48:50,820 --> 00:48:52,770
God be wi' ye

711
00:49:16,050 --> 00:49:20,330
Well, Lizzie, my congratulations.

712
00:49:21,820 --> 00:49:24,200
Thank you, Mr Harris.

713
00:49:28,530 --> 00:49:30,490
Will you take the air with me?

714
00:49:30,530 --> 00:49:32,410
I was thinking...

715
00:49:32,450 --> 00:49:34,330
a drink.

716
00:49:37,180 --> 00:49:39,930
Lord Rochester left at the curtain.

717
00:49:42,940 --> 00:49:44,890
Then I shall take the air alone.

718
00:49:44,930 --> 00:49:47,090
Good night.

719
00:49:55,260 --> 00:49:57,210
Go on!

720
00:50:11,100 --> 00:50:13,050
My lord.

721
00:50:14,460 --> 00:50:16,810
Hurry!

722
00:50:16,860 --> 00:50:18,170
Argh!

723
00:50:33,180 --> 00:50:34,530
John.

724
00:50:34,620 --> 00:50:36,570
Madam, this driveway will not do.

725
00:50:37,010 --> 00:50:38,900
Good afternoon, my lord.

726
00:50:38,940 --> 00:50:40,820
You sent no warning of your arrival.

727
00:50:40,860 --> 00:50:43,690
The road is not functional
and the grounds are a swamp.

728
00:50:43,740 --> 00:50:47,970
If you were here more often,
you'd know that Oxfordshire is not a dry county.

729
00:50:49,980 --> 00:50:54,650
It is a good thing that John devote himself
to the House. I will not hear him reproved for it.

730
00:50:54,820 --> 00:50:58,970
lunderstood that he was devoting himself
to an engagement in the theatre.

731
00:50:59,050 --> 00:51:02,600
That would not be appropriate
for a man of breeding.

732
00:51:15,380 --> 00:51:17,290
Anyone can drink.

733
00:51:17,300 --> 00:51:20,890
Only a few can match my determination.

734
00:51:21,140 --> 00:51:25,730
We who are nobility
rise above the calls of the flesh.

735
00:51:25,940 --> 00:51:27,820
It is true.

736
00:51:27,860 --> 00:51:30,690
We have our strength of will, do we not?

737
00:51:30,740 --> 00:51:32,530
I hope we do.

738
00:51:36,980 --> 00:51:38,930
But supposing we are perverse,

739
00:51:39,860 --> 00:51:42,890
and use our will to bad ends?

740
00:51:43,220 --> 00:51:45,810
Then we search deep inside ourselves,

741
00:51:47,530 --> 00:51:50,450
and we tear out the evil.

742
00:52:00,010 --> 00:52:02,050
Tear deeper, Mother.

743
00:52:22,140 --> 00:52:24,090
ROCHESTER: Lizzie Barry!

744
00:52:25,980 --> 00:52:27,930
Lizzie Barry!

745
00:52:30,180 --> 00:52:32,130
Lizzie Barry!

746
00:52:35,660 --> 00:52:39,050
I ran away from your love
and now I run towards i

747
00:52:39,980 --> 00:52:42,170
Test my love in any way you see fi!

748
00:52:43,340 --> 00:52:45,290
Test me!

749
00:52:46,570 --> 00:52:47,640
I will not fail!

750
00:53:41,460 --> 00:53:43,130
15.

751
00:53:43,460 --> 00:53:48,290
Get back some of the money I lost
on Lizzie "Horseface" Barry.

752
00:53:48,330 --> 00:53:51,090
Yes, how is that little caper going, Johnny?

753
00:53:52,340 --> 00:53:54,290
I hear she charges by the minute.

754
00:53:58,580 --> 00:54:01,290
Come on, Johnny. All gentlemen together.

755
00:54:01,460 --> 00:54:03,410
You're not a gentleman, George.

756
00:54:04,340 --> 00:54:07,610
You were trained as a lawyer.
And you write plays for money.

757
00:54:07,700 --> 00:54:12,330
Oh, yes. And what about your commission
from the King? Does that not count?

758
00:54:12,500 --> 00:54:14,250
That is quite different.

759
00:54:14,300 --> 00:54:16,250
"Different"? Of course.

760
00:54:18,050 --> 00:54:21,170
May one enquire
how the great work progresses?

761
00:54:21,420 --> 00:54:23,780
Written the first line yet?

762
00:54:23,820 --> 00:54:29,730
I, at least, do not plagiarise the wit of my friends
and pass it off as my own.

763
00:54:29,940 --> 00:54:31,410
Come on, Johnny, be fair.

764
00:54:42,260 --> 00:54:44,130
Sit!

765
00:54:49,560 --> 00:54:51,510
What was the wager?

766
00:54:51,920 --> 00:54:54,300
The wager was 15 guineas.

767
00:54:56,720 --> 00:55:00,260
My Lord, the actress Elizabeth Barry's outside.

768
00:55:00,560 --> 00:55:02,510
She will wait.

769
00:55:03,440 --> 00:55:05,630
She's very insistent.

770
00:55:05,720 --> 00:55:07,990
She is a whore and she will wait!

771
00:55:21,760 --> 00:55:23,640
It's a made hand!

772
00:55:23,680 --> 00:55:25,910
I was not good in the play this afternoon.

773
00:55:26,080 --> 00:55:28,030
I craved reassurance.

774
00:55:28,960 --> 00:55:30,910
All I could think about was you.

775
00:55:34,720 --> 00:55:37,990
You see, that is where there is still
imbalance between us.

776
00:55:38,080 --> 00:55:41,310
Because you demand
so much of me and so little of yourself.

777
00:55:43,350 --> 00:55:46,310
You took my small gift and polished it
until it shone.

778
00:55:47,680 --> 00:55:50,390
Yet your own great gift you just throw away.

779
00:55:52,960 --> 00:55:54,840
There.

780
00:55:54,880 --> 00:55:56,830
You see? I went too far.

781
00:55:57,760 --> 00:56:01,750
A trait which in you is fascinating,
but in me is a fault.

782
00:56:22,720 --> 00:56:25,790
"And wit was his vain, frivolous pretence,

783
00:56:26,080 --> 00:56:29,110
of pleasing others at his own expense. "

784
00:56:36,640 --> 00:56:38,590
Lizzie Barry.

785
00:56:44,800 --> 00:56:46,750
Read me some more.

786
00:58:11,240 --> 00:58:13,150
I keep coming back to the French

787
00:58:13,240 --> 00:58:16,630
- There they are, the envy of Europe.
- They keep a nice class of brothel.

788
00:58:16,660 --> 00:58:19,430
Of course. They're a bunch of cunts.
That's not the point.

789
00:58:19,480 --> 00:58:23,950
Ineed money and they can provide it, and
I won't hide it from you, Johnny, things are bad.

790
00:58:24,280 --> 00:58:27,190
I can't get money out of Louis
unless I dissolve Parliament

791
00:58:27,230 --> 00:58:30,110
and I can't get money out of Parliament
unless I fight Louis.

792
00:58:30,150 --> 00:58:31,990
Well, choose.

793
00:58:32,440 --> 00:58:34,370
Ineed money from both of them.

794
00:58:34,410 --> 00:58:36,240
You spoke of a big challenge.

795
00:58:36,280 --> 00:58:39,150
Louis's sent in a new ambassador.
Cultivated type.

796
00:58:39,160 --> 00:58:41,110
Here's my plan.

797
00:58:41,560 --> 00:58:44,510
Your great work,
we stage it to welcome him to London.

798
00:58:44,550 --> 00:58:46,320
Big gesture of friendship.

799
00:58:46,350 --> 00:58:48,420
And we show we're better than they are.

800
00:58:48,760 --> 00:58:51,710
A spectacle with some really profound writing.

801
00:58:51,750 --> 00:58:53,270
You're the man for it.

802
00:58:53,560 --> 00:58:55,440
Will you do it for me?

803
00:58:55,480 --> 00:58:58,630
At Betterton's next spring
when the season's finished.

804
00:58:58,830 --> 00:59:00,720
You're desperate.

805
00:59:00,760 --> 00:59:04,190
What we need to celebrate is life itself.

806
00:59:04,230 --> 00:59:07,630
Well, I'm obviously the man for that.

807
00:59:07,960 --> 00:59:11,110
Good. I'll send Chiffinch
to talk to you about the money.

808
00:59:11,310 --> 00:59:14,070
Costumes, settings, something really splendid.

809
00:59:14,100 --> 00:59:15,670
Splendid, yes.

810
00:59:16,120 --> 00:59:18,070
And unusual.

811
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:20,950
There, John.

812
00:59:20,990 --> 00:59:22,870
Fruit.

813
00:59:23,310 --> 00:59:26,270
Fruit from South America... growing here.

814
00:59:27,160 --> 00:59:29,040
Dazzles the mind.

815
00:59:29,080 --> 00:59:32,350
Do you see what can be done
with knowledge and application?

816
00:59:44,120 --> 00:59:46,790
"I eat to swive and swive to eat again."

817
00:59:53,720 --> 00:59:55,650
Ink! Ink!

818
00:59:55,690 --> 00:59:57,590
Bring me ink!

819
01:00:03,800 --> 01:00:06,430
Not "drink", lump. Ink!

820
01:00:07,830 --> 01:00:10,750
Alcock, did I not leave you in the country?

821
01:00:10,780 --> 01:00:12,670
I walked back, my lord.

822
01:00:18,120 --> 01:00:20,050
Back again?

823
01:00:20,090 --> 01:00:21,920
Back again.

824
01:00:21,960 --> 01:00:23,910
Sceptres bear. Fear.

825
01:00:38,160 --> 01:00:41,700
I'm worried. This French business
couldn't be more important.

826
01:00:41,800 --> 01:00:43,750
What's he doing?

827
01:00:45,640 --> 01:00:47,520
He's writing.

828
01:00:47,560 --> 01:00:51,310
- For the first time since I've known him
- But what?

829
01:00:52,830 --> 01:00:54,770
Sublime thoughts.

830
01:00:54,810 --> 01:00:56,710
Philosophy in verse.

831
01:00:57,640 --> 01:00:59,870
I believe he is on the verge of greatness.

832
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:02,950
You've read some?

833
01:01:03,880 --> 01:01:05,910
He shares everything with me.

834
01:01:09,160 --> 01:01:11,110
You should wear more jewellery.

835
01:01:12,040 --> 01:01:14,550
LIZZIE: I cannot provide for i on my wages

836
01:01:14,920 --> 01:01:16,950
CHARLES ll: Does not the Earl provide?

837
01:01:16,980 --> 01:01:18,980
The Earl is not one of life's providers.

838
01:01:19,160 --> 01:01:21,040
But the King is.

839
01:01:21,080 --> 01:01:23,640
If you want the best, you may receive it from me.

840
01:01:26,360 --> 01:01:28,630
I shall be everything you wish me to be.

841
01:01:28,760 --> 01:01:32,710
I wish you to be my eyes and ears
on his earlship.

842
01:01:33,560 --> 01:01:35,510
I am his lover.

843
01:01:36,920 --> 01:01:38,870
But I am your true subject.

844
01:01:40,280 --> 01:01:42,230
Then you'll serve me in this matter?

845
01:01:44,120 --> 01:01:46,070
Yes, I will.

846
01:01:48,920 --> 01:01:51,910
And we shall both... profit.

847
01:02:57,280 --> 01:03:02,110
Does the writing of the play go well, my lord?

848
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:08,030
Alcock, try not to be a cunt.

849
01:03:08,800 --> 01:03:11,230
We will do this until you get it right.

850
01:03:12,160 --> 01:03:14,190
My lord, Alice Twooney has sent word.

851
01:03:14,560 --> 01:03:16,630
Her child is sick and she shan't come.

852
01:03:17,440 --> 01:03:19,350
What was to be her role?

853
01:03:19,830 --> 01:03:23,030
- She was playing little Clytoris.
- Of course

854
01:03:23,680 --> 01:03:24,990
Alcock!

855
01:03:27,960 --> 01:03:30,910
- This is your moment. You will stand in for her.
- No, my lord.

856
01:03:30,950 --> 01:03:33,300
- I beg your pardon.
- I'm Alcock.

857
01:03:33,720 --> 01:03:35,870
Little Clytoris is beyond my range.

858
01:03:37,080 --> 01:03:38,710
Molly.

859
01:03:38,880 --> 01:03:41,710
I am not a visible person.

860
01:03:42,080 --> 01:03:44,030
Do not cross me.

861
01:03:45,600 --> 01:03:50,720
Madam, your dildos
are not to compare with what I've seen.

862
01:03:50,880 --> 01:03:52,830
Indeed, they're paltry ware.

863
01:03:53,760 --> 01:03:56,630
Short dildos leave the pleasure half undone.

864
01:03:56,640 --> 01:03:58,790
I'm sorry, my lord, I do have a question.

865
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:05,510
Are you sure this entertainment will be fitting
for both the occasion and the company?

866
01:04:07,080 --> 01:04:10,400
Molly, the entire piece has been devised
with the French in mind.

867
01:04:10,440 --> 01:04:15,150
In Paris, fornication in the streets
with total strangers is compulsory.

868
01:04:16,200 --> 01:04:19,550
Oh, beg pardon, my lord,
my most southerly venture is Epsom.

869
01:04:20,040 --> 01:04:21,440
HARRIS: My lord!

870
01:04:21,480 --> 01:04:23,230
I asked for no interruptions.

871
01:04:23,400 --> 01:04:25,280
My suit is one of the utmost urgency.

872
01:04:25,310 --> 01:04:28,350
The stage direction
at the end of this scene requires,

873
01:04:28,680 --> 01:04:31,310
in my opinion, some authorial exposition.

874
01:04:31,560 --> 01:04:33,510
It seems straightforward enough.

875
01:04:33,550 --> 01:04:35,310
Yes. Um...

876
01:04:35,400 --> 01:04:38,110
"Then dance six naked men and women,

877
01:04:38,280 --> 01:04:41,750
the men doing obedience to the women's cunts,

878
01:04:41,780 --> 01:04:43,520
kissing and touching them often.

879
01:04:43,560 --> 01:04:46,430
The women in like manner to the men's pricks,

880
01:04:46,920 --> 01:04:49,510
kissing and dandling their cods,

881
01:04:49,540 --> 01:04:51,200
and then fall to fucking,

882
01:04:51,240 --> 01:04:55,430
after which the women sigh
and the men look simple, and so sneak off. "

883
01:04:56,520 --> 01:04:58,790
The end of the second act

884
01:04:58,920 --> 01:05:00,670
A strong scene.

885
01:05:00,830 --> 01:05:04,670
An eminently playable scene,
and, though I say it myself, a climactic one.

886
01:05:05,560 --> 01:05:08,910
And will the kind of equipment
that young lady has in her hand

887
01:05:09,400 --> 01:05:11,350
be available to gentlemen for...

888
01:05:12,760 --> 01:05:16,630
.. strapping around the middle
for the execution of this scene?

889
01:05:17,560 --> 01:05:19,910
I had not envisaged you to be so encumbered.

890
01:05:21,400 --> 01:05:25,890
I feel the scene should be given... in the flesh.

891
01:05:25,930 --> 01:05:30,390
And will we give... two performances on the day?

892
01:05:30,560 --> 01:05:32,160
No, Mr Harris.

893
01:05:32,200 --> 01:05:35,230
Oh, I am glad to hear that from the author.

894
01:05:35,360 --> 01:05:39,870
With the dress rehearsal, the court performance
and the public showing, I envisage three.

895
01:05:39,920 --> 01:05:44,310
Right. I don't know if you've met
my regular understudy, Mr Lightman.

896
01:05:44,640 --> 01:05:46,520
He's a most dependable fellow.

897
01:05:46,560 --> 01:05:49,230
Sir, you have the honour
of playing my understudy.

898
01:05:49,440 --> 01:05:53,950
Well, I shall take this opportunity
to withdraw from the engagement.

899
01:05:55,200 --> 01:05:57,660
You are one of life's understudies!

900
01:06:10,960 --> 01:06:13,750
If tonight goes wrong,
we'll be at war within a week.

901
01:06:17,360 --> 01:06:19,820
Have faith.

902
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:24,070
Whatever else may go wrong,
your words will command admiration.

903
01:06:26,040 --> 01:06:27,990
They always do.

904
01:06:30,360 --> 01:06:33,390
Lizzie. You're looking pale.

905
01:06:33,480 --> 01:06:37,230
Molly, work the magic of your art on Mrs Barry.

906
01:06:47,240 --> 01:06:49,190
There's the French ambassador.

907
01:06:56,520 --> 01:06:58,270
No. Makes me weepy.

908
01:07:12,520 --> 01:07:15,230
I weep, but from a different end.

909
01:07:53,360 --> 01:07:55,550
Very good, this Italian workmanship.

910
01:07:56,880 --> 01:07:59,120
People pay more for quality.

911
01:08:04,480 --> 01:08:06,510
I'd like to meet the man who wrote this.

912
01:09:22,400 --> 01:09:26,270
Thus in the zenith of my lust I reign.

913
01:09:26,400 --> 01:09:29,910
I eat to swive and swive to eat again.

914
01:09:30,120 --> 01:09:35,110
Let other monarchs who their sceptres bear
to keep their subjects less in love than fear

915
01:09:35,120 --> 01:09:37,480
be slaves to crowns

916
01:09:37,520 --> 01:09:41,390
My nation shall be free.
My pintle only shall my sceptre be.

917
01:09:42,830 --> 01:09:45,300
My laws shall act more pleasure than command

918
01:09:45,720 --> 01:09:50,150
and with my prick, I'll govern all the land.

919
01:09:50,190 --> 01:09:52,030
Chas, tell me this ain't happening.

920
01:09:52,200 --> 01:09:55,710
He's gonna get his prick out any second.
I can feel it in my water.

921
01:09:55,830 --> 01:09:59,910
It's very amusing, because in France
he would be executed for this.

922
01:10:00,160 --> 01:10:04,190
ROCHESTER: The King commands all men
from humid cunt to humane arsonist

923
01:10:04,230 --> 01:10:07,110
Buggery we choose and buggery we'll allow

924
01:10:07,360 --> 01:10:11,990
I do proclaim the manly arse so firm
shall be the sole recipient

925
01:10:12,160 --> 01:10:13,560
of sperm!

926
01:10:13,600 --> 01:10:17,350
CHARLES ll:
Lord Rochester, this portrayal of yours...

927
01:10:18,720 --> 01:10:21,350
.. would it be based on a particular monarch?

928
01:10:21,390 --> 01:10:23,190
No, Your Highness.

929
01:10:23,520 --> 01:10:28,830
My character is far too fantastic a creation
ever to have drawn breath.

930
01:10:29,120 --> 01:10:31,990
Now resume your seat.
You're intruding on my stage.

931
01:10:32,030 --> 01:10:33,830
No, you're intruding on mine.

932
01:10:34,520 --> 01:10:39,510
I hand you a chance to show your shining talent
and what do you give me in return?

933
01:10:39,520 --> 01:10:45,150
A pornographic representation of a royal court
where the men deal only in buggery

934
01:10:45,360 --> 01:10:49,390
and the women's sole object of interest
is the dildo!

935
01:10:49,430 --> 01:10:51,580
A monument to your reign.

936
01:10:52,950 --> 01:10:54,180
Johnny!

937
01:11:09,600 --> 01:11:12,350
CHARLES ll:
Disappear? People don't disappear.

938
01:11:16,400 --> 01:11:18,150
Monsieur Barrillon.

939
01:11:18,320 --> 01:11:23,670
Your Majesty, it is with regret that I must
make my return to France tout de suite.

940
01:11:42,120 --> 01:11:44,070
I hate racing.

941
01:11:44,440 --> 01:11:46,710
The sport of kings? The sport of peasants!

942
01:11:46,830 --> 01:11:49,630
Come on, Georgie. You like it when you win.

943
01:11:49,720 --> 01:11:53,340
I must have seen the backside of ?60 today.

944
01:11:53,380 --> 01:11:55,030
I could have bought a horse.

945
01:11:55,480 --> 01:12:00,030
Vanishing Spark. Why did you let me
bet on a horse called Vanishing Spark?

946
01:12:00,060 --> 01:12:01,310
What the fuck?

947
01:12:02,680 --> 01:12:04,430
Johnny?

948
01:12:05,360 --> 01:12:06,790
Gents

949
01:12:06,950 --> 01:12:09,710
spare a drink for a couple of chums?

950
01:12:10,520 --> 01:12:11,740
Where've you been?

951
01:12:11,950 --> 01:12:14,830
Our show was such a success in the capital,

952
01:12:15,800 --> 01:12:19,340
we had to undertake
an extensive tour of the provinces.

953
01:12:19,640 --> 01:12:23,950
Now, where's the fucking drink?

954
01:12:23,950 --> 01:12:26,390
Come on, Charlie, get out your winnings.

955
01:12:26,720 --> 01:12:29,590
CHARLIE: This is i gentlemen!

956
01:12:29,600 --> 01:12:35,030
This is the residence of the whore
personally recommended by Mr Dryden himself,

957
01:12:35,070 --> 01:12:37,100
who glories in the name of Molly Noakes

958
01:12:37,360 --> 01:12:39,200
Well, what are we waiting for?

959
01:12:39,240 --> 01:12:42,030
- Open up, keepers of the gate!
- Molly!

960
01:12:42,120 --> 01:12:43,950
Molly!

961
01:12:44,030 --> 01:12:45,920
- Molly...
- Molly!

962
01:12:45,950 --> 01:12:48,230
- Gentlemen?
ROCHESTER: Where's Molly?

963
01:12:48,360 --> 01:12:50,630
DOWNS: We want Molly and we want her fast.

964
01:12:50,760 --> 01:12:54,110
Young man, you are pissing on my top boots.

965
01:12:54,120 --> 01:12:57,070
Yes, fellow.
But you are a whorehouse doorstep man

966
01:12:57,480 --> 01:12:59,630
and we are the cream of the country.

967
01:13:00,830 --> 01:13:02,790
I am Constable of the Watch.

968
01:13:04,200 --> 01:13:06,470
Dryden can't even write a shag map.

969
01:13:06,600 --> 01:13:09,310
You, sir, are a rogue and a liar.

970
01:13:09,950 --> 01:13:11,750
Murder!

971
01:13:11,870 --> 01:13:12,910
Help!

972
01:13:24,360 --> 01:13:26,660
Now, then, gentlemen...

973
01:13:27,720 --> 01:13:31,950
I do believe there's been
a small species of error.

974
01:13:32,030 --> 01:13:34,310
We are Johnny! Johnny!

975
01:13:34,440 --> 01:13:35,990
Johnny!

976
01:13:36,280 --> 01:13:37,830
No!

977
01:13:39,640 --> 01:13:40,270
Argh!

978
01:13:41,080 --> 01:13:42,220
Argh!

979
01:13:42,520 --> 01:13:44,670
My eyes!

980
01:14:07,600 --> 01:14:09,550
Johnny, please...

981
01:14:14,320 --> 01:14:16,270
Johnny!

982
01:14:29,200 --> 01:14:31,150
I told you.

983
01:14:35,440 --> 01:14:37,390
CHARLES ll: It's been six months

984
01:14:38,320 --> 01:14:40,990
Where the fuck is he?

985
01:14:41,200 --> 01:14:42,550
Find him

986
01:14:42,640 --> 01:14:43,780
Your Majesty.

987
01:14:57,030 --> 01:14:59,670
ROCHESTER:
I find myself at the gates of death

988
01:14:59,910 --> 01:15:02,380
almost blind and utterly lame

989
01:15:03,280 --> 01:15:06,510
Scarce wih the reasonable hope
of ever seeing you again

990
01:15:07,600 --> 01:15:10,950
Wih my sickness
i seems the world has turned hateful of me

991
01:15:11,440 --> 01:15:17,070
But I will rise again to right this injustice
and take back your heart

992
01:15:20,080 --> 01:15:24,270
The mercury cures the pox,
but it scrambles the mind.

993
01:15:26,320 --> 01:15:28,310
Poses a problem for a gent, does it not?

994
01:15:28,340 --> 01:15:29,950
The prick or the brain?

995
01:15:30,160 --> 01:15:32,830
Shh. Johnny, shush.

996
01:15:50,480 --> 01:15:54,950
He's been seen in Cheapside,
accompanied by a serving man and a whore.

997
01:15:56,720 --> 01:15:58,870
If he's very drunk, he'll be no problem.

998
01:15:59,120 --> 01:16:01,070
If he's a bit drunk, be careful.

999
01:16:01,110 --> 01:16:03,400
What if he's sober?

1000
01:16:03,440 --> 01:16:04,790
You've got the wrong man.

1001
01:16:08,720 --> 01:16:10,670
Ladies and gents!

1002
01:16:11,120 --> 01:16:12,610
Gather near!

1003
01:16:12,650 --> 01:16:14,110
Listen well.

1004
01:16:14,480 --> 01:16:18,650
For I got a doctor's cure to sell.

1005
01:16:18,690 --> 01:16:22,830
Mouth, stomach, knees and toes.

1006
01:16:23,080 --> 01:16:27,070
All be cured by Dr Bendo.

1007
01:16:31,240 --> 01:16:33,430
Little chicken.

1008
01:16:41,640 --> 01:16:43,510
Questurino!

1009
01:16:46,910 --> 01:16:48,430
Mayo.

1010
01:16:49,320 --> 01:16:50,750
In honestus.

1011
01:16:52,120 --> 01:16:53,590
Gulpo.

1012
01:16:57,520 --> 01:16:58,500
Poofay.

1013
01:17:22,080 --> 01:17:25,510
In flatuo. In flatuo.

1014
01:17:25,910 --> 01:17:29,990
The French, Parliament, his syphilitic earlship.

1015
01:17:30,480 --> 01:17:34,550
I'm being pissed on
from half a dozen directions at once,

1016
01:17:34,580 --> 01:17:37,710
and it don't accord with my majestic dignity.

1017
01:17:38,080 --> 01:17:41,350
We have three confirmed sightings.
Our sources are impeccable.

1018
01:17:42,560 --> 01:17:44,510
Take me to them. Now.

1019
01:17:45,440 --> 01:17:47,390
I've shut up shop for the day.

1020
01:17:47,830 --> 01:17:50,190
I had to turn 40 people away.

1021
01:17:51,200 --> 01:17:54,900
I think it mean work
cozening citizens of their money.

1022
01:17:55,030 --> 01:17:56,920
We made ?80 today.

1023
01:17:56,950 --> 01:17:59,710
We are here for our recreation.

1024
01:17:59,830 --> 01:18:02,190
We're here cos
we can't show our faces.

1025
01:18:02,240 --> 01:18:06,070
Do you ever think... on our Lord Jesus Christ?

1026
01:18:09,440 --> 01:18:11,590
He was cast like me into the wilderness.

1027
01:18:12,800 --> 01:18:14,750
He was scorned and reviled.

1028
01:18:16,640 --> 01:18:18,790
He was betrayed by his followers.

1029
01:18:19,200 --> 01:18:24,390
I believe that in most respects,
his life was of a different character from yours.

1030
01:18:24,480 --> 01:18:27,950
He would have brought Billy Downs
back from death.

1031
01:18:27,980 --> 01:18:29,670
Ach, these are wandering thoughts.

1032
01:18:37,720 --> 01:18:39,430
Leave me.

1033
01:18:42,520 --> 01:18:44,470
Go!

1034
01:18:54,870 --> 01:18:55,780
Johnny!

1035
01:18:58,080 --> 01:18:59,510
Johnny!

1036
01:18:59,520 --> 01:19:01,820
Argh! Johnny!

1037
01:19:04,800 --> 01:19:06,310
Leave him alone!

1038
01:19:07,680 --> 01:19:09,630
On your knees.

1039
01:19:20,160 --> 01:19:22,110
I'm not impressed.

1040
01:19:23,520 --> 01:19:26,720
It has taken you six months to find me.

1041
01:19:26,760 --> 01:19:30,990
You think in six months I've given you
more than five minutes' thought?

1042
01:19:31,020 --> 01:19:33,950
Those Parliament bastards
are trying to shaft me again

1043
01:19:34,200 --> 01:19:36,990
wih the new bill to exclude my successors

1044
01:19:37,030 --> 01:19:38,670
Subtle.

1045
01:19:38,830 --> 01:19:43,070
Instead of chopping kings' heads off,
you pick and choose the ones you want.

1046
01:19:44,600 --> 01:19:47,590
That's my civil war. Not you.

1047
01:19:54,990 --> 01:20:00,550
Mr Etherege is packing out the Dorset Gardens
with you as the greatest spark on Earth.

1048
01:20:00,760 --> 01:20:05,310
The East End is throwing down its purse
for you to be a quack doctor.

1049
01:20:05,560 --> 01:20:10,950
And the town has you branded as a coward
who leaves his friend to die in a brawl.

1050
01:20:10,980 --> 01:20:12,980
All men would be cowards...

1051
01:20:13,020 --> 01:20:14,990
if they only had the courage.

1052
01:20:15,160 --> 01:20:17,790
The boy died and you ran off.

1053
01:20:18,030 --> 01:20:19,990
I have to go too far, do you see?

1054
01:20:21,870 --> 01:20:24,630
I must always exceed
or I do not feel like I'm alive.

1055
01:20:24,760 --> 01:20:29,750
And that's why the great epic about my reign
became a squalid little play about knobbing.

1056
01:20:29,780 --> 01:20:31,670
And that's why Downs died.

1057
01:20:36,760 --> 01:20:39,590
I thought about putting you in the Tower.

1058
01:20:43,480 --> 01:20:46,710
I even considered putting your head on a spike.

1059
01:20:48,240 --> 01:20:50,750
But I've decided on something worse.

1060
01:20:52,080 --> 01:20:54,030
I'm going to ignore you

1061
01:20:55,320 --> 01:20:59,630
I will no longer encourage
any hope in my breast for you.

1062
01:21:00,830 --> 01:21:03,220
I am condemning you to be you,

1063
01:21:03,240 --> 01:21:05,390
for the rest of your days

1064
01:21:34,760 --> 01:21:36,710
How I hate the country.

1065
01:21:48,680 --> 01:21:50,390
Drink.

1066
01:21:51,560 --> 01:21:52,830
Drink!

1067
01:22:07,400 --> 01:22:08,950
The shelves are empty, my lord.

1068
01:22:09,320 --> 01:22:11,270
Go to the cellars, cunt!

1069
01:22:12,680 --> 01:22:15,270
I said, find me a fucking drink.

1070
01:22:59,950 --> 01:23:03,580
Are you unable to discharge your duties
as housekeeper?

1071
01:23:03,800 --> 01:23:07,030
ALCOCK: I fear this is the last my lord

1072
01:23:08,120 --> 01:23:10,870
Elizabeth, why has the cellar
not been replenished?

1073
01:23:10,990 --> 01:23:12,220
Leave us.

1074
01:23:13,400 --> 01:23:14,750
Leave us!

1075
01:23:14,830 --> 01:23:16,870
My lady.

1076
01:23:31,830 --> 01:23:35,380
I am ever your last resort. When your mistress
has kicked you into the street

1077
01:23:35,420 --> 01:23:38,310
and the last whore in Covent Garden
refuses to attend to you,

1078
01:23:38,560 --> 01:23:40,310
then and only then do you come to me!

1079
01:23:40,480 --> 01:23:45,420
I think you will never be a contented woman
until you are a much-respected widow.

1080
01:23:45,460 --> 01:23:48,830
And I am hard at work
on doing you that last good service.

1081
01:23:48,910 --> 01:23:52,750
I don't want you to die!
I want you to live, and live differently!

1082
01:23:55,910 --> 01:23:57,870
- Ow!
- Stop it!

1083
01:24:05,360 --> 01:24:06,950
Elizabeth!

1084
01:24:08,440 --> 01:24:11,640
Why? If it's good for you,
is it not good for me, too?

1085
01:24:11,680 --> 01:24:15,110
- It is not good for me.
- Why then do you pursue that path?

1086
01:24:17,830 --> 01:24:19,630
When were you last a sober man?

1087
01:24:25,480 --> 01:24:27,430
Three years...

1088
01:24:28,360 --> 01:24:30,310
No, four...

1089
01:24:31,720 --> 01:24:33,670
Four years ago.

1090
01:24:34,600 --> 01:24:37,390
Five. Five.

1091
01:24:37,480 --> 01:24:39,510
And are you not, John, a rational man?

1092
01:24:41,320 --> 01:24:43,750
Has not your intellect been widely praised?

1093
01:24:44,200 --> 01:24:46,440
It has.

1094
01:24:46,480 --> 01:24:48,430
So, this man of intellect,

1095
01:24:48,760 --> 01:24:50,640
this rational man,

1096
01:24:50,680 --> 01:24:55,230
knowing that five years of constant drinking
have rendered his body feeble and his spirit low,

1097
01:24:55,480 --> 01:24:57,360
what would this man of intellect do?

1098
01:24:57,400 --> 01:25:00,750
- You seek to trap me like a cunning lawyer!
- What would he do?

1099
01:25:00,760 --> 01:25:03,470
He would desist! Cunt!

1100
01:25:03,520 --> 01:25:05,430
Yes, he would desist. And those he loved,

1101
01:25:05,760 --> 01:25:08,510
would they not show their love
by beseeching him to desist?

1102
01:25:08,640 --> 01:25:11,100
It is not so simple, my darling.

1103
01:25:50,400 --> 01:25:52,910
I've heard men say that the devil is in you.

1104
01:25:52,950 --> 01:25:55,430
If that be so, I know how he made his entrance.

1105
01:26:05,280 --> 01:26:09,270
He has suffered much
both in sickness and in reputation.

1106
01:26:11,520 --> 01:26:13,470
You're a man of God.

1107
01:26:14,400 --> 01:26:16,230
Bring my son to him.

1108
01:26:24,480 --> 01:26:25,880
My son,

1109
01:26:25,910 --> 01:26:29,070
God has seen fit
to visit these terrible diseases on you.

1110
01:26:30,240 --> 01:26:34,590
But it torments me less as a mother
to see you die in agony in the arms of God...

1111
01:26:35,520 --> 01:26:37,710
.. than live an atheist.

1112
01:26:37,910 --> 01:26:39,470
Mother.

1113
01:27:04,440 --> 01:27:07,470
If God wants men to have faith,

1114
01:27:09,520 --> 01:27:12,190
why does he not make us
more disposed to believe?

1115
01:27:12,400 --> 01:27:15,510
Most men are so disposed.

1116
01:27:16,240 --> 01:27:17,640
But not me.

1117
01:27:17,680 --> 01:27:20,950
Because you set your reason against religion.

1118
01:27:21,040 --> 01:27:22,630
I despised reason.

1119
01:27:22,950 --> 01:27:24,910
You clung to reason.

1120
01:27:25,830 --> 01:27:29,300
You laughed in the face of God
with the aid of reason.

1121
01:27:31,600 --> 01:27:33,550
Speak me that speech again.

1122
01:27:35,440 --> 01:27:37,390
Those words from Isaiah.

1123
01:27:41,200 --> 01:27:45,030
"And he is despised and rejected of men.

1124
01:27:46,480 --> 01:27:48,430
A man of sorrows...

1125
01:27:49,830 --> 01:27:51,790
.. and acquainted with grief. "

1126
01:27:52,720 --> 01:27:55,470
And we hid our faces from him.

1127
01:27:57,040 --> 01:27:59,150
God, raise me from this bed

1128
01:27:59,190 --> 01:28:01,270
to do what I must do

1129
01:28:04,440 --> 01:28:07,590
We've taken soundings.
It's very close. We may be 15 votes short.

1130
01:28:07,760 --> 01:28:10,430
The House cannot give way to the King
on this matter!

1131
01:28:10,460 --> 01:28:12,270
Then get me 15 votes.

1132
01:28:12,720 --> 01:28:14,670
And I believe it will not!

1133
01:28:14,710 --> 01:28:16,470
Hear, hear!

1134
01:28:24,360 --> 01:28:27,350
The Earl of Rochester.

1135
01:28:28,910 --> 01:28:30,870
MAN: Coward!

1136
01:28:32,160 --> 01:28:34,790
ANOTHER MAN: Coward

1137
01:28:41,520 --> 01:28:43,470
My lord...

1138
01:28:44,870 --> 01:28:49,900
.. the bill before us would seek to bar
the King's brother from succeeding to the throne

1139
01:28:50,160 --> 01:28:53,230
on the grounds that he is a Catholic.

1140
01:28:54,480 --> 01:28:57,680
And for this reason i has been said

1141
01:28:57,720 --> 01:29:02,270
that no good Protestant
can speak against this bill.

1142
01:29:03,320 --> 01:29:09,190
And yet, sir, I cannot forbear
to offer some objections against it.

1143
01:29:10,520 --> 01:29:16,750
But the question will arise
in the minds of some lords here present...

1144
01:29:17,720 --> 01:29:19,670
.. as to whether I am indeed...

1145
01:29:21,560 --> 01:29:23,510
.. a good Protestant.

1146
01:29:26,830 --> 01:29:28,720
No man here

1147
01:29:28,760 --> 01:29:30,710
will question, I hope,

1148
01:29:33,080 --> 01:29:35,030
my goodness...

1149
01:29:35,950 --> 01:29:39,830
.. in any one of the three chief pursuits
of our age,

1150
01:29:39,870 --> 01:29:41,630
the scribbling of verses,

1151
01:29:41,720 --> 01:29:44,070
the emptying of bottles,

1152
01:29:45,080 --> 01:29:47,030
and the filling of wenches.

1153
01:29:49,400 --> 01:29:52,030
There may be those
with a claim to be as good as I,

1154
01:29:53,240 --> 01:29:57,310
but taking these three pursuits simultaneously...

1155
01:29:58,160 --> 01:30:00,110
.. and, sir, I have so taken them,

1156
01:30:00,280 --> 01:30:06,380
and can vouch
that considerable manual dexterity is required,

1157
01:30:07,480 --> 01:30:12,390
I cannot be equalled, let alone bettered.

1158
01:30:15,160 --> 01:30:21,150
So, let not my goodness be questioned.

1159
01:30:29,120 --> 01:30:32,470
It is not so many years
since our present king's father

1160
01:30:33,990 --> 01:30:38,700
.. was killed on a kind of stage,
outside the walls of this very building.

1161
01:30:40,760 --> 01:30:47,390
And, in time, his murderers were condemned
and themselves executed.

1162
01:30:48,240 --> 01:30:50,120
But...

1163
01:30:50,160 --> 01:30:54,310
were they condemned without being heard?

1164
01:30:57,360 --> 01:30:59,310
They were not.

1165
01:31:00,720 --> 01:31:05,710
In spite of the certainty of their guilt
and the horrid weight of their cowardly crime,

1166
01:31:07,440 --> 01:31:11,550
they were allowed the due process of law.

1167
01:31:13,680 --> 01:31:16,030
But what is suggested before this House...

1168
01:31:17,040 --> 01:31:21,430
.. is that we condemn
that murdered king's second son

1169
01:31:21,460 --> 01:31:25,390
with less shrift than was given to his killers.

1170
01:31:27,600 --> 01:31:31,590
My lord, let us have justice.

1171
01:31:33,360 --> 01:31:40,990
When the time arrives for our good
and present king to be taken from us

1172
01:31:43,440 --> 01:31:48,630
let then his Catholic brother be impeached
in this House in the normal way.

1173
01:31:50,640 --> 01:31:55,990
And if he be found wanting,
then let his head be chopped off at the neck...

1174
01:31:58,640 --> 01:32:01,470
if the House feel that is what he meris

1175
01:32:04,400 --> 01:32:06,280
For my part

1176
01:32:06,320 --> 01:32:10,670
I shall believe my oath of allegiance
to the throne to be a thing inviolable...

1177
01:32:12,080 --> 01:32:15,510
.. and that whatever the faith
of the successor to the throne,

1178
01:32:16,400 --> 01:32:22,070
his pre-eminence in the royal lineage
must hold sway

1179
01:32:22,160 --> 01:32:25,030
over all other considerations.

1180
01:32:26,950 --> 01:32:28,910
Sir,

1181
01:32:29,360 --> 01:32:31,660
my humble motion...

1182
01:32:32,720 --> 01:32:34,670
.. is that the monarchy...

1183
01:32:34,710 --> 01:32:36,590
be upheld...

1184
01:32:37,520 --> 01:32:44,550
.. and this meddlesome and fractious bill
be thrown out forever.

1185
01:32:44,720 --> 01:32:46,670
MEMBERS: Hear, hear!

1186
01:32:49,040 --> 01:32:51,710
MAN: Kings are kings!
You can't pick and choose!

1187
01:32:52,870 --> 01:32:55,020
MAN: Throw it out! Throw it out!

1188
01:32:56,240 --> 01:32:58,190
MAN: He spoke for us all!

1189
01:33:18,360 --> 01:33:20,310
Johnny.

1190
01:33:20,760 --> 01:33:22,710
You did it.

1191
01:33:23,640 --> 01:33:25,590
You finally did something for me.

1192
01:33:26,520 --> 01:33:28,470
I didn't do it for you.

1193
01:33:28,510 --> 01:33:30,390
I did it for me.

1194
01:33:33,720 --> 01:33:36,310
Your Majesty, we won.

1195
01:33:36,600 --> 01:33:38,190
By 40 votes.

1196
01:33:46,120 --> 01:33:48,070
There you are, Johnny.

1197
01:33:49,480 --> 01:33:51,430
You did it.

1198
01:33:54,910 --> 01:33:56,310
Molly.

1199
01:33:56,360 --> 01:33:59,470
I've brought in the Earl to gawp at my triumph.

1200
01:33:59,720 --> 01:34:02,790
Authors have a place, Mr Etherege.
It is in the garret.

1201
01:34:02,820 --> 01:34:04,950
I do not like them cluttering up my theatre.

1202
01:34:04,990 --> 01:34:08,350
Lizzie won't see him.
She won't see Johnny. This is the only way.

1203
01:34:08,360 --> 01:34:10,110
I don't want her upset.

1204
01:34:10,280 --> 01:34:12,310
I could have written a splendid play.

1205
01:34:12,680 --> 01:34:14,610
No, you couldn't.

1206
01:34:14,650 --> 01:34:16,480
The Man Of Mode.

1207
01:34:16,520 --> 01:34:19,990
The spirit of the age caught for all time.

1208
01:34:20,360 --> 01:34:21,760
I did it.

1209
01:34:21,800 --> 01:34:25,150
You didn't, because you don't have the gift.

1210
01:34:28,520 --> 01:34:30,150
Gentle George.

1211
01:34:36,680 --> 01:34:38,910
- What is he doing here?
- Don't blame me.

1212
01:34:40,520 --> 01:34:42,710
John, I'll see you after. I'll be at Long's.

1213
01:34:42,910 --> 01:34:45,910
Very well. Lockett's?

1214
01:34:46,280 --> 01:34:48,710
Long's.

1215
01:34:51,080 --> 01:34:53,030
Long's.

1216
01:34:59,720 --> 01:35:01,670
I saw the first two acts.

1217
01:35:03,560 --> 01:35:05,510
And you didn't like me?

1218
01:35:05,550 --> 01:35:07,360
To the contrary.

1219
01:35:07,400 --> 01:35:10,070
I could bear your brilliance no longer.

1220
01:35:14,120 --> 01:35:16,470
Mr Harris, you are playing me.

1221
01:35:16,520 --> 01:35:19,630
The understudy has become the actor.

1222
01:35:19,870 --> 01:35:23,070
My lord, I heard news of your death
six months ago

1223
01:35:23,110 --> 01:35:24,750
and experienced a spasm of regret.

1224
01:35:25,200 --> 01:35:28,550
But your subsequent resurrection
has quite cured my grief.

1225
01:35:29,520 --> 01:35:33,990
I am nature, and you are art.

1226
01:35:36,240 --> 01:35:38,120
Let us see how we compare.

1227
01:35:38,160 --> 01:35:41,390
Mr Harris has a quick change
and you will let him be.

1228
01:35:41,560 --> 01:35:44,150
Here we have him, your Restoration gent.

1229
01:35:44,180 --> 01:35:46,100
He's not pissed his breeches today

1230
01:35:46,360 --> 01:35:52,190
and he can walk in a straight line for 200 yards
without falling on his face and retching.

1231
01:35:53,080 --> 01:35:55,030
Now,

1232
01:35:55,480 --> 01:35:58,150
look you upon this picture

1233
01:35:58,180 --> 01:35:59,830
and on this

1234
01:36:00,200 --> 01:36:02,470
He has not washed He cannot walk

1235
01:36:02,600 --> 01:36:08,750
And he most certainly will not be able to raise
either the price of his dinner or his own pintle.

1236
01:36:08,790 --> 01:36:10,670
I must be got into my nightgown.

1237
01:36:10,830 --> 01:36:12,900
This is what I envy in you stage people.

1238
01:36:12,940 --> 01:36:15,250
You make time seem so important.

1239
01:36:15,280 --> 01:36:17,550
I must change my clothes now!

1240
01:36:18,040 --> 01:36:19,830
I must make my entrance now!

1241
01:36:21,440 --> 01:36:24,030
But life is not a succession of urgent nows.

1242
01:36:24,070 --> 01:36:26,630
It is a listless trickle of Why should I's.

1243
01:36:26,720 --> 01:36:28,310
You're on.

1244
01:36:31,040 --> 01:36:33,070
MOLLY: Five minutes only, Mrs Barry.

1245
01:36:39,200 --> 01:36:41,470
Inever wanted you for a mistress, Lizzie.

1246
01:36:43,040 --> 01:36:44,750
I wanted you for my wife.

1247
01:36:48,320 --> 01:36:50,270
You have no understanding, do you?

1248
01:36:53,120 --> 01:36:57,310
It was not being your mistress
that I was tired of, John.

1249
01:36:57,910 --> 01:36:59,230
I was tired of you.

1250
01:37:00,320 --> 01:37:02,700
I did not wish to be your wife.

1251
01:37:02,720 --> 01:37:05,280
I do not wish to be anyone's wife.

1252
01:37:05,600 --> 01:37:08,550
I wish to continue being the creature I am.

1253
01:37:09,440 --> 01:37:12,000
London walks into this theatre to see me.

1254
01:37:12,320 --> 01:37:15,640
Not George's play, nor Mr Betterton.

1255
01:37:15,680 --> 01:37:18,430
They want me,
and they want me over and over again.

1256
01:37:19,520 --> 01:37:24,030
I will not swap my certain glory
for your undependable love.

1257
01:37:27,680 --> 01:37:29,630
I wanted you to have my child.

1258
01:37:29,670 --> 01:37:31,550
I had your child.

1259
01:37:32,480 --> 01:37:34,360
A daughter.

1260
01:37:34,400 --> 01:37:36,830
When the theatres were closed in the summer.

1261
01:37:37,280 --> 01:37:41,510
By the start of the season I was flat enough
to play Desdemona in a nightgown.

1262
01:37:41,600 --> 01:37:43,750
MOLLY: Two minutes, Mrs Barry, please.

1263
01:37:45,440 --> 01:37:47,390
What is her name?

1264
01:37:48,320 --> 01:37:49,830
Elizabeth.

1265
01:37:50,240 --> 01:37:52,190
Elizabeth?

1266
01:37:53,600 --> 01:37:55,550
The child of our passion.

1267
01:37:57,910 --> 01:38:02,470
When I bred my other children,
I placed no value on human life at all, and...

1268
01:38:04,640 --> 01:38:06,590
...now you send me away.

1269
01:38:07,520 --> 01:38:10,550
And I cannot go back to where I was before.

1270
01:38:12,800 --> 01:38:16,270
I shall never forgive you
for teaching me to love life.

1271
01:38:18,560 --> 01:38:21,830
If I taught you that, then our account is settled.

1272
01:38:22,870 --> 01:38:25,050
Your lesson to me was my livelihood.

1273
01:38:25,090 --> 01:38:27,230
And mine to you was life itself.

1274
01:38:28,640 --> 01:38:30,590
We have no need to meet again.

1275
01:38:32,480 --> 01:38:34,590
Lizzie.

1276
01:38:34,870 --> 01:38:36,760
If you are in London,

1277
01:38:36,800 --> 01:38:38,950
and you have half a crown in your pocket,

1278
01:38:39,200 --> 01:38:41,150
you may see me there.

1279
01:38:41,190 --> 01:38:43,070
For the rest,

1280
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:46,030
I hope I shall always be in your heart,

1281
01:38:46,400 --> 01:38:48,750
sometimes in your thoughts,

1282
01:38:48,800 --> 01:38:51,390
but never in your debt.

1283
01:39:27,720 --> 01:39:29,670
I am 33...

1284
01:39:30,600 --> 01:39:32,550
.. years old.

1285
01:39:34,910 --> 01:39:36,870
I am dying.

1286
01:39:39,240 --> 01:39:42,030
I have tried to speak the truth.

1287
01:39:44,040 --> 01:39:46,600
But I have been betrayed.

1288
01:39:56,040 --> 01:39:57,990
Elizabeth...

1289
01:40:00,830 --> 01:40:05,030
.. speak to me of abduction.

1290
01:40:09,000 --> 01:40:10,950
I was 18.

1291
01:40:13,320 --> 01:40:16,510
And worth two and a half thousand a year.

1292
01:40:18,120 --> 01:40:20,070
You ambushed me,

1293
01:40:21,950 --> 01:40:24,590
bundled me into your coach
and rattled me away.

1294
01:40:26,280 --> 01:40:28,230
The King thrust...

1295
01:41:23,120 --> 01:41:26,110
He charmed the tenderest virgins with delight.

1296
01:41:26,950 --> 01:41:30,910
And with his style did fiercest blockheads fright.

1297
01:42:08,240 --> 01:42:10,310
So, there he lies at the last.

1298
01:42:11,120 --> 01:42:13,050
The deathbed convert.

1299
01:42:13,090 --> 01:42:14,990
The pious debauchee.

1300
01:42:16,870 --> 01:42:19,430
Could not dance half a measure, could I?

1301
01:42:21,200 --> 01:42:25,150
Give me wine, I'd drain the dregs
and toss the empty bottle at the world.

1302
01:42:26,000 --> 01:42:27,880
Show me our Lord Jesus in agony,

1303
01:42:27,910 --> 01:42:32,350
and I mount the cross
and steal his nails for my own palms.

1304
01:42:34,640 --> 01:42:41,550
There I go, shuffling from the world,
my dribble fresh upon a Bible.

1305
01:42:43,280 --> 01:42:47,510
I look upon a pinhead...
and I see angels dancing.

1306
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:51,950
Well?

1307
01:42:53,360 --> 01:42:55,310
Do you like me now?

1308
01:42:58,640 --> 01:43:00,590
Do you like me now?

1309
01:43:05,830 --> 01:43:07,790
Do you like me now?

1310
01:43:12,560 --> 01:43:14,510
Do you like me...

1311
01:43:14,550 --> 01:43:16,430
now?
