00:00:01,994 --> 00:00:03,194
My sweet Cassie,

00:00:03,219 --> 00:00:04,968
You finding this means
I'm gone,

4
00:00:04,993 --> 00:00:06,405
and for that,
I am so sorry.

5
00:00:06,430 --> 00:00:08,008
I didn't want you
to have this life.

00:00:08,033 --> 00:00:09,918
But destiny's not easy
to run from.

Hi, I'm Diana.

00:00:11,168 --> 00:00:12,685
You seen her yet?
She got in yesterday.

00:00:13,196 --> 00:00:14,587
We're different.
You're different.

10
00:00:14,612 --> 00:00:17,528
You're a witch. You're a
full-blooded, 100% witch.

00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:20,139
You're here.
We have real power now.

She's got the gift.

you find out?

After the fire, she spent two
years in a psychiatric hospital.

dropped off the face of the Earth.

Why do you wanna
go to Finn Creek?

We're trying to find out what
happened to Heather Barnes.

68
00:02:48,991 --> 00:02:50,191
She has a brother there.

69

And you think
he knows something?

70
00:02:51,743 --> 00:02:52,910
It's worth checking out.

I can't reschedule

No, it's fine. Really.

I'm fine.

00:03:04,006 --> 00:03:06,340
Heather was in that
fire 16 years ago.

79

Maybe she can tell us what
happened to our parents.

80
00:03:10,962 --> 00:03:12,129
Sure.

81
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:14,031
I'll pick you up

What's the point of being
a damned witch if I can't

89
00:03:48,819 --> 00:03:50,468

I mean the first half,
not the stuff with the snakes.

spells on boys

you like this guy.

But we both know
it's not going to last.

102
00:04:18,563 --> 00:04:20,030
He's a dog.

103
00:04:20,082 --> 00:04:22,249
That's not true.
He can be sweet.

into your pants.

105
00:04:24,169 --> 00:04:26,954

in school and you know it.

a little fishing village

I'm Wade. What do you
want with my sister?

122
00:05:51,823 --> 00:05:54,858
My mother, Amelia Blake,
was friends with Heather

123
00:05:54,883 --> 00:05:56,083

No. It wouldn't.

Maybe that's something
Heather should decide.

00:06:29,327 --> 00:06:30,828
You think so?

It's witchcraft, isn't it?

181
00:09:56,575 --> 00:10:00,244
It's a Sigil. They're
used for certain spells.

182
00:10:00,329 --> 00:10:01,729
I've seen them before
in our research.

183
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:03,397
Do you think that's
what's wrong with her?

184
00:10:03,448 --> 00:10:04,665
A spell?

185
00:10:05,667 --> 00:10:08,536
Zachary said my mother
did something

186
00:10:08,587 --> 00:10:10,287
to Heather that was
worse than death.

187
00:10:10,372 --> 00:10:12,289
Is that what he meant?

188
00:10:12,374 --> 00:10:14,408
Cassie, I don't know.

189
00:10:14,459 --> 00:10:16,744
Is that why
she grabbed me?

190
00:10:16,795 --> 00:10:20,581
Because somehow she
knew I was related?

191
00:10:20,632 --> 00:10:21,766
It doesn't make sense.

192
00:10:21,850 --> 00:10:23,083
Heather was her friend.

193
00:10:23,135 --> 00:10:24,352
Why would she do
that to a friend?

194
00:10:24,419 --> 00:10:26,253
We don't know
your mother did this.

195
00:10:26,304 --> 00:10:30,691
No...I do know.

196
00:10:39,451 --> 00:10:41,068
Where's your grandmother?

197
00:10:41,119 --> 00:10:43,771
At the hospital.
Working the late shift.

198
00:10:43,822 --> 00:10:45,239
She's a nurse.

199
00:10:45,290 --> 00:10:46,624
I know.
When I was 10,

200
00:10:46,708 --> 00:10:49,543
she set my arm
when I broke it.

201
00:10:59,671 --> 00:11:01,806
I found this.

202
00:11:05,811 --> 00:11:07,545
Is that what I think it is?

203
00:11:07,612 --> 00:11:10,314
My family's
Book of Shadows.

204
00:11:10,382 --> 00:11:12,316
I found it
when I first got here.

205
00:11:12,401 --> 00:11:14,134
But how?

206
00:11:14,186 --> 00:11:15,820
My mother left it for me.

207
00:11:15,904 --> 00:11:17,488
She wanted me to find it.

208
00:11:17,572 --> 00:11:19,323
I haven't told anyone.

209
00:11:19,408 --> 00:11:22,159
Can I see it?

210
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,751
Each of the six families
has their own book,

211
00:11:30,819 --> 00:11:33,704
but we've only
found Diana's.

212
00:11:33,789 --> 00:11:36,156
Everything we know about who
we are, we got from her book.

213
00:11:36,208 --> 00:11:39,343
But it's specific
to her family.

214
00:11:39,428 --> 00:11:42,996
Different spells,
different histories.

215
00:11:43,048 --> 00:11:46,267
This book is
completely different.

216
00:11:46,334 --> 00:11:48,436
We could learn
so much from this.

217
00:11:53,775 --> 00:11:57,528
The Sigil on Heather's arm...
I've seen it in here.

218
00:11:58,897 --> 00:12:00,698
Here.

219
00:12:01,616 --> 00:12:04,235
That's
my mother's handwriting.

220
00:12:04,319 --> 00:12:07,688
She had to be the one
to put the spell on Heather.

221
00:12:07,739 --> 00:12:09,540
I need to know why.

222
00:12:09,624 --> 00:12:11,992
It's a suppression
spell of some kind.

223
00:12:12,043 --> 00:12:13,794
Why would my mother do that?

224
00:12:13,862 --> 00:12:15,663
She would never hurt
someone like this.

225
00:12:15,714 --> 00:12:16,964
Not the mother I knew.

226
00:12:17,031 --> 00:12:19,667
I'm sorry, Cassie.

227
00:12:21,169 --> 00:12:23,537
Does it say how to undo it?

228
00:12:24,673 --> 00:12:26,340
Um...

229
00:12:28,009 --> 00:12:29,927
Right here, I think.

230
00:12:30,011 --> 00:12:32,680
I want to.

231
00:12:32,731 --> 00:12:35,783
If we can undo this spell, then
she can tell us what happened.

232
00:12:35,851 --> 00:12:37,601
If it even works.

233
00:12:37,686 --> 00:12:40,321
We have to try.
You saw that woman.

234
00:12:40,388 --> 00:12:42,857
If we can make her better,
we have to.

235
00:12:49,915 --> 00:12:54,535
♪ I can't begin to... ♪

236
00:12:54,586 --> 00:12:58,255
Hey, what are you doing?

237
00:12:58,340 --> 00:13:00,341
Waiting for Nick.
I'm early.

238
00:13:00,408 --> 00:13:06,647
Listen, I wanted
to apologize about before.

239
00:13:06,715 --> 00:13:11,602
If you really like Nick,
then I'll get on board with it.

240
00:13:11,670 --> 00:13:14,305
I promise.
The last thing I'd want

241
00:13:14,389 --> 00:13:16,841
is for you to think
I was jealous of him.

242
00:13:16,908 --> 00:13:18,592
Thanks.

243
00:13:18,643 --> 00:13:20,144
Sure.

244
00:13:20,228 --> 00:13:27,902
And by the way...I think
Nick got here early, too.

245
00:13:34,943 --> 00:13:36,744
You're a bitch.

246
00:13:36,795 --> 00:13:37,962
[Scoffs]

247
00:13:39,948 --> 00:13:44,168
No. I'm you're friend.

248
00:13:52,844 --> 00:13:54,895
The spell requires a poultice.

249
00:13:54,963 --> 00:13:56,480
And that would be?

250
00:13:56,565 --> 00:13:58,515
A magic potion.

251
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:00,968
And I'm being serious.

252
00:14:01,019 --> 00:14:04,154
I have most of the ingredients
here except the main one.

253
00:14:04,239 --> 00:14:06,139
Which is blood.

254
00:14:07,475 --> 00:14:09,510
The spell maker's. Yours.

255
00:14:09,578 --> 00:14:11,362
You're cool with that?

256
00:14:11,446 --> 00:14:12,947
And, um...

257
00:14:12,998 --> 00:14:15,749
My mom used her blood
to begin with, right?

258
00:14:15,817 --> 00:14:17,167
If it was her spell, she did.

259
00:14:20,855 --> 00:14:21,922
Hey, can you do it?

260
00:14:21,990 --> 00:14:23,924
Because I'm like
petrified of needles.

261
00:14:23,992 --> 00:14:26,326
Ok.

262
00:14:34,836 --> 00:14:38,022
Are you going to do it, or are
you just keep torturing me?

263
00:14:38,106 --> 00:14:39,273
Ok.

264
00:15:03,882 --> 00:15:05,198
How's that?

265
00:15:07,719 --> 00:15:12,306
Hey! You're here.

266
00:15:14,476 --> 00:15:16,560
Adam told me what
you want to do.

267
00:15:16,645 --> 00:15:19,980
Yeah, you should have
seen Heather Barnes.

268
00:15:20,048 --> 00:15:22,149
- We have to help her.
- Are you sure you are?

269
00:15:22,216 --> 00:15:25,052
We're going to undo the
spell that was put on her.

270
00:15:25,937 --> 00:15:27,821
I don't think it's a good idea.

271
00:15:28,873 --> 00:15:30,824
What if we do it wrong?

272
00:15:30,892 --> 00:15:32,459
What if it hurts her worse?

273
00:15:32,527 --> 00:15:34,411
We'll be careful.

274
00:15:34,496 --> 00:15:36,814
How do you even know
what you're doing?

275
00:15:36,881 --> 00:15:40,200
My book doesn't even tell you
how to undo a spell like this.

276
00:15:40,268 --> 00:15:42,369
My book does.

277
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:46,740
You have a book?

278
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:49,843
It was her mother's.

279
00:15:49,911 --> 00:15:51,261
She left it for her.

280
00:15:51,346 --> 00:15:52,880
It has the spell.

281
00:15:52,947 --> 00:15:55,182
You're the one who always wanted
to know what happened to our parents.

282
00:15:55,249 --> 00:15:57,084
Maybe we can find out
with the two books.

283
00:15:57,135 --> 00:15:58,552
Not now, Adam.
Not for this.

284
00:15:58,603 --> 00:16:00,304
It's too risky.

285
00:16:01,723 --> 00:16:03,256
I'm sorry, Cassie.

286
00:16:03,308 --> 00:16:07,227
You can't do the spell by
yourself and we can't help you.

287
00:16:07,278 --> 00:16:08,228
Adam?

288
00:16:08,279 --> 00:16:11,482
We can help her.
You didn't see her.

289
00:16:11,566 --> 00:16:12,866
What my mom did.

290
00:16:12,934 --> 00:16:14,284
Please?

291
00:16:15,553 --> 00:16:17,071
I'm sorry.

292
00:16:17,138 --> 00:16:18,789
Maybe when we understand more.

293
00:16:18,873 --> 00:16:20,657
But right now, we
just don't know enough

294
00:16:20,742 --> 00:16:22,076
to do something like this.

295
00:16:22,143 --> 00:16:24,128
Diana.

296
00:16:28,249 --> 00:16:30,300
Let me talk to her.

297
00:16:36,474 --> 00:16:37,808
Hey.

298
00:16:39,978 --> 00:16:42,012
You having
fun out there

299
00:16:42,097 --> 00:16:43,263
with your
little chipee?

300
00:16:43,314 --> 00:16:45,766
What are you talking about?

301
00:16:45,817 --> 00:16:47,868
I saw you talking
to that girl.

302
00:16:47,936 --> 00:16:49,636
You mean Andrea?

303
00:16:49,687 --> 00:16:52,406
Come on, Mel.
We were talking.

304
00:16:52,473 --> 00:16:54,441
Didn't look like you
were talking to me.

305
00:16:54,492 --> 00:16:57,244
So now I can't talk to girls?
Is that the deal now?

306
00:16:57,311 --> 00:17:00,197
You know, I was
hoping maybe to get

307
00:17:00,281 --> 00:17:02,449
5 minutes before you
turned into a douche.

308
00:17:02,517 --> 00:17:05,252
What's going on with you?

309
00:17:05,319 --> 00:17:08,205
I thought things were good.

310
00:17:08,289 --> 00:17:09,990
You know what?
Faye was right.

311
00:17:10,041 --> 00:17:11,959
You're never
going to change.

312
00:17:14,262 --> 00:17:15,879
Go find another
slut toy.

313
00:17:15,964 --> 00:17:17,965
I'm done.

314
00:17:27,308 --> 00:17:28,842
What are you doing here?

315
00:17:28,893 --> 00:17:31,178
Adam and Diana just left.

316
00:17:31,229 --> 00:17:32,529
Why so pouty?

317
00:17:32,614 --> 00:17:34,815
You wouldn't understand.

318
00:17:37,152 --> 00:17:38,986
Try me.

319
00:17:40,155 --> 00:17:41,521
Fine.

320
00:17:41,573 --> 00:17:44,541
I want to undo a spell that
could answer a lot of questions

321
00:17:44,626 --> 00:17:46,326
about how our parents
died 16 years ago

322
00:17:46,377 --> 00:17:48,829
and Diana and
Adam won't help me.

323
00:17:49,831 --> 00:17:53,083
Boy, did
I miss a chapter.

324
00:17:53,151 --> 00:17:57,638
Wait a minute, is
that a Book of Shadows?

325
00:17:57,705 --> 00:18:01,341
You have your own?
[Gasps]

326
00:18:01,392 --> 00:18:02,976
I have looked and looked
for my family's book

327
00:18:03,044 --> 00:18:04,428
and I can't find it.

328
00:18:04,512 --> 00:18:05,596
That's enough.

329
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:10,350
Oh, come on, don't
be like that.

330
00:18:10,401 --> 00:18:12,820
I thought you needed help.

331
00:18:12,887 --> 00:18:14,688
You're going to help me?

332
00:18:14,739 --> 00:18:18,391
Sure. If you let me read
your book, why not?

333
00:18:18,443 --> 00:18:19,660
You need my help.

334
00:18:19,727 --> 00:18:21,612
And to be honest, I
have never understood

335
00:18:21,696 --> 00:18:24,448
why we're not
better friends.

336
00:18:51,129 --> 00:18:52,579
Let's go.

337
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:13,317
You conveniently left out
the haunted house part.

338
00:19:13,384 --> 00:19:14,968
Yes.

339
00:19:21,559 --> 00:19:22,993
Come on.

340
00:19:26,915 --> 00:19:29,733
This is really creepy.

341
00:19:34,622 --> 00:19:37,240
Your mother did this?

342
00:19:39,010 --> 00:19:40,177
Why?

343
00:19:40,244 --> 00:19:42,963
I don't know. That's what
I'm hoping to find out.

344
00:19:43,047 --> 00:19:44,748
I mean, seriously.

345
00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:47,200
What could anyone
do to deserve...

346
00:19:47,268 --> 00:19:49,686
Your mother must have been
one mean ass witch--

347
00:19:49,754 --> 00:19:51,605
Faye. Please.

348
00:19:51,689 --> 00:19:52,689
Can we just try
to help her?

349
00:19:52,757 --> 00:19:54,024
I'm sorry.

350
00:19:54,091 --> 00:19:56,426
Let's do this.

351
00:19:56,477 --> 00:19:58,562
I'm going to apply the stuff
that Adam and I made

352
00:19:58,613 --> 00:20:00,314
and then we'll do
the chant together.

353
00:20:00,398 --> 00:20:01,398
Will it work?

354
00:20:01,449 --> 00:20:02,449
I have no idea.

355
00:20:02,533 --> 00:20:03,450
I don't know what
the spell is,

356
00:20:03,534 --> 00:20:04,618
I don't know
what the words mean,

357
00:20:04,702 --> 00:20:06,119
I don't even know how
to pronounce them.

358
00:20:06,204 --> 00:20:07,738
Ok, we can do this.

359
00:20:07,789 --> 00:20:09,773
You dragged me all
the way out here,

360
00:20:09,824 --> 00:20:12,942
so let's get
to the bottom of it.

361
00:20:35,466 --> 00:20:39,686
"Rongaire balorum
eunarach vicit romnia."

362
00:20:39,771 --> 00:20:43,807
"Rongaire balorum
eunarach vicit romnia."

363
00:20:50,665 --> 00:20:51,948
Again?

364
00:20:54,118 --> 00:20:57,537
Rongaire balorum
eunarach vicit romnia.

365
00:20:57,622 --> 00:21:00,874
Rongaire balorum
eunarach vicit romnia.

366
00:21:07,331 --> 00:21:09,099
[Sighs]

367
00:21:11,335 --> 00:21:13,770
I'm sorry.

368
00:21:13,838 --> 00:21:15,389
I thought it would work.

369
00:21:15,473 --> 00:21:17,391
[Door opens]

370
00:21:20,945 --> 00:21:22,779
[Rustling]

371
00:22:01,069 --> 00:22:02,853
Maybe we did it wrong?

372
00:22:02,904 --> 00:22:04,020
Or I screwed
up the potion?

373
00:22:04,072 --> 00:22:05,272
Can we talk about
this in the car?

374
00:22:05,356 --> 00:22:06,857
Far away from here.

375
00:22:06,908 --> 00:22:08,358
Thanks for trying.

376
00:22:08,409 --> 00:22:11,778
I know I don't come across
like I care about much...

377
00:22:11,863 --> 00:22:13,530
But my dad died that night.

378
00:22:13,581 --> 00:22:15,916
I don't think my mom's
ever gotten over it.

379
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,784
And I want to know what
happened just as much as anyone.

380
00:22:17,869 --> 00:22:19,536
I guess we're all
in the same boat.

381
00:22:19,587 --> 00:22:22,038
Yep, a boat full of sad witches.

382
00:22:22,090 --> 00:22:26,460
So how about we go back to your
place and check out the book?

383
00:22:26,544 --> 00:22:27,844
Another time.

384
00:22:27,912 --> 00:22:32,682
I'd say I've earned
a peek, wouldn't you?

385
00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:34,267
Yes.

386
00:22:59,961 --> 00:23:01,578
[Squishing]

387
00:23:06,784 --> 00:23:08,084
[Gasps]

388
00:23:09,921 --> 00:23:12,005
Heather?

389
00:23:12,089 --> 00:23:13,757
Oh, my God.

390
00:23:19,063 --> 00:23:21,014
[Heather breathing
heavily]

391
00:23:21,098 --> 00:23:23,767
[Grunting]

392
00:23:23,818 --> 00:23:25,652
Heather, what
the hell's happening?

393
00:23:25,736 --> 00:23:28,071
Aah!

394
00:23:46,681 --> 00:23:48,516
[Dog barking in background]

395
00:23:51,353 --> 00:23:52,503
[Door opens]

396
00:23:55,557 --> 00:23:57,775
Waiting to
catch me cheating?

397
00:23:57,859 --> 00:24:01,395
I came to apologize.

398
00:24:01,446 --> 00:24:03,897
I overreacted.

399
00:24:03,949 --> 00:24:06,400
You think?

400
00:24:06,451 --> 00:24:10,287
I saw you with that other
girl and I just went off.

401
00:24:10,372 --> 00:24:11,738
I'm sorry.

402
00:24:11,790 --> 00:24:12,957
Yeah?

403
00:24:14,426 --> 00:24:17,845
Faye was saying some things and
I made the mistake of listening.

404
00:24:17,912 --> 00:24:19,463
Like what?

405
00:24:20,549 --> 00:24:21,915
[Sighs] It doesn't matter.

406
00:24:21,967 --> 00:24:23,517
Just stupid things.

407
00:24:23,585 --> 00:24:25,936
It's not like you're my
boyfriend or anything,

408
00:24:26,021 --> 00:24:29,440
so I don't have
the right to be jealous.

409
00:24:31,810 --> 00:24:33,310
Ok.

410
00:24:36,431 --> 00:24:40,067
So...We're good?

411
00:24:40,118 --> 00:24:44,321
Yeah. We're good.

412
00:24:49,444 --> 00:24:51,879
I'm sorry for putting
you in the middle

413
00:24:51,947 --> 00:24:54,048
of this thing with Cassie.

414
00:24:54,115 --> 00:24:57,084
I understand why you
don't want to do this.

415
00:24:57,135 --> 00:24:59,953
I just know how badly Cassie
wants to find answers.

416
00:25:00,005 --> 00:25:00,888
You know.

417
00:25:00,955 --> 00:25:02,089
Well, I'm glad she didn't.

418
00:25:02,140 --> 00:25:03,474
Because I went back
to my book.

419
00:25:03,558 --> 00:25:06,260
I knew there was something about
that symbol that bugged me.

420
00:25:07,345 --> 00:25:08,896
Look at this.

421
00:25:08,963 --> 00:25:11,732
These are all ubilaz markings.

422
00:25:11,799 --> 00:25:15,402
Uh...really old, black magic.

423
00:25:15,470 --> 00:25:19,139
Demons, evil
entities...Possession.

424
00:25:20,141 --> 00:25:21,525
Heather was possessed?

425
00:25:21,610 --> 00:25:22,743
[Inhales]

426
00:25:22,810 --> 00:25:26,113
The notes here are all
about using snakes and insects

427
00:25:26,181 --> 00:25:27,981
as vessels for dark energy.

428
00:25:28,033 --> 00:25:30,084
Forcing them inside someone.

429
00:25:30,151 --> 00:25:32,536
I think the Sigils are meant
to keep it from coming back out.

430
00:25:32,621 --> 00:25:34,254
Like a suppression spell.

431
00:25:34,322 --> 00:25:36,624
This is way beyond witchcraft.

432
00:25:36,675 --> 00:25:39,426
It's seriously dark magic.

433
00:25:39,494 --> 00:25:40,978
None of this was
in Cassie's book.

434
00:25:41,046 --> 00:25:43,847
If she'd known about this, she
never would have tried the spell.

435
00:25:43,932 --> 00:25:46,500
That's kinda
the point I was making.

436
00:25:47,585 --> 00:25:48,802
I've got to call her.

437
00:25:48,853 --> 00:25:51,105
Why? She didn't
do the spell.

438
00:25:51,172 --> 00:25:53,691
But she still
needs to know.

439
00:26:04,319 --> 00:26:06,236
Ok, that's enough for today.

440
00:26:06,321 --> 00:26:07,871
Oh, calm down.

441
00:26:07,956 --> 00:26:11,158
Or I can take it home with me
and be out of your hair.

442
00:26:11,209 --> 00:26:12,159
[Sighs]

443
00:26:12,210 --> 00:26:14,078
[Knock on door]

444
00:26:18,133 --> 00:26:19,466
Mmm.

445
00:26:20,969 --> 00:26:23,671
Will you bring me
back some snacks?

446
00:26:23,738 --> 00:26:25,806
No carbs.

447
00:27:07,248 --> 00:27:09,433
[Gasps]

448
00:27:10,351 --> 00:27:13,270
Where is Amelia?

449
00:27:18,704 --> 00:27:20,405
Can you help me
find Amelia?

450
00:27:20,489 --> 00:27:23,374
She's not here.

451
00:27:24,376 --> 00:27:27,712
How did you...

452
00:27:29,298 --> 00:27:30,715
Are you ok?

453
00:27:31,717 --> 00:27:33,885
I need to see her.

454
00:27:35,053 --> 00:27:37,972
Amelia passed away.

455
00:27:38,039 --> 00:27:39,891
No.

456
00:27:41,376 --> 00:27:43,928
I'm her daughter.

457
00:27:45,881 --> 00:27:48,182
Cassie.

458
00:27:48,233 --> 00:27:49,901
Cassie.

459
00:27:51,069 --> 00:27:53,187
You were a baby.

460
00:27:53,238 --> 00:27:56,240
I tried to help her
take you away.

461
00:27:57,242 --> 00:27:58,559
She did.

462
00:27:58,610 --> 00:28:00,745
She took me
far away from here.

463
00:28:00,829 --> 00:28:03,030
She wanted you
to be safe.

464
00:28:03,081 --> 00:28:05,133
She tried to
leave that night.

465
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:07,118
What night?

466
00:28:07,202 --> 00:28:10,204
Do you mean
the night of the fire?

467
00:28:10,255 --> 00:28:12,874
Can you tell me
what happened that night?

468
00:28:15,210 --> 00:28:17,962
She was trying
to stop it.

469
00:28:18,046 --> 00:28:19,931
She wanted to protect us.

470
00:28:20,015 --> 00:28:22,099
All of us.

471
00:28:22,184 --> 00:28:24,919
But it went inside me.

472
00:28:26,054 --> 00:28:27,305
What did?

473
00:28:27,372 --> 00:28:30,057
Evil.

474
00:28:31,894 --> 00:28:35,262
And I can still feel it.

475
00:28:35,314 --> 00:28:36,814
It hurts.

476
00:28:36,899 --> 00:28:39,233
Aah!

477
00:28:41,787 --> 00:28:44,238
Your mother
couldn't get it out.

478
00:28:44,289 --> 00:28:46,374
But she made
the pain go away.

479
00:28:46,441 --> 00:28:48,876
And now it's come back.

480
00:28:48,944 --> 00:28:51,779
Ohh!

481
00:28:51,830 --> 00:28:55,466
Can you please help me?

482
00:28:55,551 --> 00:28:58,252
How? How can I?

483
00:28:58,303 --> 00:28:59,921
[Crying]

484
00:28:59,972 --> 00:29:04,458
Please...make it stop.

485
00:29:04,510 --> 00:29:06,177
[Screaming]

486
00:29:21,426 --> 00:29:23,194
[Line ringing]

487
00:29:27,315 --> 00:29:29,133
She's not picking up.

488
00:29:29,201 --> 00:29:30,868
[Vibrating]

489
00:29:40,379 --> 00:29:43,330
Ugh. Voicemail.

490
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:46,667
Try again.

491
00:29:46,718 --> 00:29:48,386
[Vibrating]

492
00:29:52,190 --> 00:29:53,357
Ah.

493
00:29:57,563 --> 00:29:59,530
Hi, sweetie.

494
00:29:59,615 --> 00:30:01,015
What?

495
00:30:01,066 --> 00:30:02,783
Who is this?

496
00:30:02,851 --> 00:30:05,019
It's Cassie.
I miss you.

497
00:30:05,070 --> 00:30:06,737
Come make magic with me.

498
00:30:06,822 --> 00:30:07,705
Faye?

499
00:30:07,789 --> 00:30:09,356
Why is she answering
Cassie's phone?

500
00:30:09,408 --> 00:30:11,492
Faye, just put Cassie on.

501
00:30:11,543 --> 00:30:13,127
She's downstairs.

502
00:30:13,194 --> 00:30:14,629
Faye, this is important.

503
00:30:14,696 --> 00:30:18,633
Oh, you sound hot.
What are you wearing?

504
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:21,419
Does Diana know
you're calling?

505
00:30:21,503 --> 00:30:22,753
Faye, please.

506
00:30:25,924 --> 00:30:27,541
What happened?

507
00:30:27,593 --> 00:30:29,760
You fainted.

508
00:30:33,065 --> 00:30:34,599
Is that what my mom did?

509
00:30:34,683 --> 00:30:37,051
Is this how she
stopped your pain?

510
00:30:37,102 --> 00:30:39,153
Yes.

511
00:30:48,530 --> 00:30:53,701
I went to the boat yard,
but I couldn't find her.

512
00:30:53,752 --> 00:30:55,235
Why was she there?

513
00:30:55,287 --> 00:30:57,371
How did the fire start?

514
00:30:57,422 --> 00:31:02,126
Wherever there are witches...
Evil follows.

515
00:31:02,210 --> 00:31:03,260
What do you mean?

516
00:31:03,345 --> 00:31:04,879
They'd been summoned.

517
00:31:04,930 --> 00:31:06,797
They were trying to
use your mother's power.

518
00:31:06,882 --> 00:31:08,382
Her and her friends.

519
00:31:08,433 --> 00:31:10,267
Who was? Why?

520
00:31:10,352 --> 00:31:12,853
She couldn't stop them all.

521
00:31:12,921 --> 00:31:16,140
And one of them
got inside me.

522
00:31:16,224 --> 00:31:17,591
One what?

523
00:31:17,643 --> 00:31:21,812
Heather, please, tell me who
she was trying to stop.

524
00:31:21,897 --> 00:31:23,430
Demons.

525
00:31:23,482 --> 00:31:25,265
[Breathing heavily]

526
00:31:43,552 --> 00:31:44,785
Heather!

527
00:31:44,836 --> 00:31:46,286
[Growling]

528
00:31:49,174 --> 00:31:52,226
Hey, Cassie, dream
boat's on the phone...

529
00:31:52,293 --> 00:31:54,461
Desperate for you.

530
00:31:58,266 --> 00:31:59,800
Cassie?

531
00:32:02,904 --> 00:32:04,572
Aah!

532
00:32:06,658 --> 00:32:09,160
Aah!

533
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:13,748
Faye?

534
00:32:14,983 --> 00:32:17,651
Help! Oh, God.

535
00:32:19,254 --> 00:32:20,955
Aah!

536
00:32:26,928 --> 00:32:28,929
[Screaming]

537
00:32:43,779 --> 00:32:45,446

00:32:50,452 --> 00:32:52,119
Aah!

539
00:32:58,293 --> 00:32:59,960
Faye!

540
00:33:02,247 --> 00:33:04,882
Faye? Wait.

541
00:33:12,224 --> 00:33:13,891
Aah!

542
00:33:19,231 --> 00:33:20,731
[Grunting]

543
00:33:21,683 --> 00:33:23,768
Aah!
Aah!
