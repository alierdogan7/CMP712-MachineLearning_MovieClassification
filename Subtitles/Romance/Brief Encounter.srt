## [Whistling]

3
00:02:11,672 --> 00:02:14,141
- Evening, Mr. Godby.
- [Mumbles]

4
00:02:14,141 --> 00:02:17,011
- Hello, hello, hello.
- Quite the stranger, aren't you?

5
00:02:17,011 --> 00:02:19,514
- I couldn't get in yesterday.
- I wondered what had happened to you.

6
00:02:19,514 --> 00:02:21,649
- I had a bit of a dustup.
- What about?

7
00:02:21,649 --> 00:02:23,651
Saw a chap getting out
of a first-class compartment.

8
00:02:23,651 --> 00:02:25,753
When he came to give up his ticket,
it was only third class.

9
00:02:25,753 --> 00:02:27,922
I told him to pay the excess,
and he turned nasty.

10
00:02:27,922 --> 00:02:30,591
- I had to send for Mr. Saunders.
- Fat lot of good he'd be.

11
00:02:30,591 --> 00:02:32,593
- He ticked him off.
- Seeing's believing.

12
00:02:32,593 --> 00:02:34,595
I tell you,
he ticked him off proper.

13
00:02:34,595 --> 00:02:37,665
<i>"You pay the balance at once,</i>
<i>or I'll hand you over to the police. "</i>

14
00:02:37,665 --> 00:02:40,902
<i>You ought to have seen the chap's face</i>
<i>at the mention of the word "police."</i>

15
00:02:40,902 --> 00:02:43,237
<i>Changed his tune.</i>
<i>Then he paid up like lightning.</i>

16
00:02:43,237 --> 00:02:46,674
That's what I mean. He didn't have
the courage to handle it himself.

17
00:02:46,674 --> 00:02:49,810
- He had to call in the police.
- Aw, he's not a bad lot, Mr. Saunders.

18
00:02:49,810 --> 00:02:53,803
You can't expect much spirit from a man
with one lung and a wife with diabetes.

19
00:02:53,848 --> 00:02:56,117
I thought something must be wrong
when you didn't come.

20
00:02:56,117 --> 00:03:00,110
- I would've popped in to explain,
but I had a date and had to run.
- Indeed.

21
00:03:00,588 --> 00:03:04,581
- Chap I know is getting married.
- Very interesting, I'm sure.

22
00:03:05,293 --> 00:03:08,896
- What's up with you, anyway?
- I'm sure I don't know
to what you're referring.

23
00:03:08,896 --> 00:03:11,999
- You're a bit unfriendly
all of a sudden.
- Beryl, hurry up.

24
00:03:11,999 --> 00:03:14,635
Put some more coal in the stove
while you're at it.

25
00:03:14,635 --> 00:03:18,372
I'm afraid I can't really
stand here wasting my time
in idle gossip, Mr. Godby.

26
00:03:18,372 --> 00:03:22,043
- Aren't you going
to offer me another cup?
- When you've finished that one.

27
00:03:22,043 --> 00:03:25,279
Beryl'll give it to you.
I've got my accounts to do.

28
00:03:25,279 --> 00:03:27,582
I see.
I'd rather you gave it to me.

29
00:03:27,582 --> 00:03:31,575
Time and tide wait for no man,
Mr. Godby.

30
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:35,590
- Laura, what a lovely surprise!
- Oh, Dolly.

31
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:37,792
My dear, I've been shopping
till I'm dropping.

32
00:03:37,792 --> 00:03:40,094
My feet are nearly off,
my throat's parched.

33
00:03:40,094 --> 00:03:43,364
I thought of having tea in Spindle's,
but I was terrified of losing the train.

34
00:03:43,364 --> 00:03:46,200
- Oh, dear.
- This is Dr. Harvey.

35
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:49,170
- How do you do?
- Would you be a perfect dear
and get me my cup of tea?

36
00:03:49,170 --> 00:03:52,006
I really don't think I could drag
my poor old bones over to the counter.

37
00:03:52,006 --> 00:03:54,108
No, please.

38
00:03:54,108 --> 00:03:57,812
Dear, what a nice-looking man.
Who on earth is he?

39
00:03:57,812 --> 00:04:01,315
You're quite a dark horse.
I shall telephone Fred in
the morning and make mischief.

40
00:04:01,315 --> 00:04:05,308
[Chuckling] This is a bit of luck.
I haven't seen you for ages.

41
00:04:05,953 --> 00:04:09,946
I've been meaning to pop in,
but Tony's had measles and I had
all that fuss over Phyllis.

42
00:04:10,024 --> 00:04:13,361
- But, of course, you don't know.
My dear, she left me.
- Oh, how dreadful.

43
00:04:13,361 --> 00:04:17,098
Mind you, I never cared for her much,
but Tony adored her.

44
00:04:17,098 --> 00:04:21,091
I'll tell you all about that later
in the train. Thank you so very much.

45
00:04:21,702 --> 00:04:25,695
There's certainly enough milk in it,
but still, it'll be refreshing.

46
00:04:27,708 --> 00:04:30,745
- Oh, dear, no sugar.
- It's in the spoon.

47
00:04:30,745 --> 00:04:33,447
Oh, of course.
What a fool I am.

48
00:04:33,447 --> 00:04:36,851
Laura, you're looking
frightfully well. I wish I'd
known you were coming in today.

49
00:04:36,851 --> 00:04:38,986
We could've come together
and lunched and had a good gossip.

50
00:04:38,986 --> 00:04:41,355
I loathe shopping
by myself anyway.

- I go in the opposite direction.
My practice is in Churley.

- I'm a general practitioner.

- Yes, you must.

- Good-bye.

<i>He's got to get over to the platform.</i>

60
00:05:18,726 --> 00:05:22,430
Talking of missing trains reminds me of
that awful bridge at Broadham Junction.

61
00:05:22,430 --> 00:05:25,766
You've got to go traipsing all up one
side along the top and down the other.

over about renewing the lease.

00:05:33,307 --> 00:05:36,777
My dear, I flew.
I'd got Tony with me,

65
00:05:36,777 --> 00:05:39,413
and like a fool, I just bought a new
shade for the lamp in the drawing room.

66
00:05:39,413 --> 00:05:41,515
I could've gotten it
just as easily here in Milford.

67
00:05:41,515 --> 00:05:45,508
Well, it was the most enormous thing.
I could hardly see over it.

68
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:48,456
I've never been in such a hurry in
my life. I nearly knocked a woman down.

Is that the Ketchworth train?

71

- <i>No, it's the express.</i>
- The boat train.

72
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:02,937
Oh, of course. That doesn't stop,
does it? I want some chocolate, please.

73
00:06:02,937 --> 00:06:05,306
- Milk or plain?
- Plain, I think.

74
00:06:05,306 --> 00:06:08,542
Or, no, perhaps milk would be nicer.
Have you any with nuts?

75
00:06:08,542 --> 00:06:10,911
Nestle's Nut Milk.
Shilling or sixpence?

76
00:06:10,911 --> 00:06:13,047
I'll take one plain
and one nut milk.

- Large, please.

80
00:06:28,162 --> 00:06:32,166
I never noticed her go.

Oh, well, this is a bit of luck.
This train's generally packed.

94
00:07:24,451 --> 00:07:27,354
I really am very worried about you,
dear. You look terribly peaky.

95
00:07:27,354 --> 00:07:30,491
I'm all right. Really, I am. I just
felt faint for a minute, that's all.

96
00:07:30,491 --> 00:07:33,260
It often happens to me. I did it once
in the middle of Bobby's school concert.

97
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:36,430
- I don't think he's ever forgiven me.
- [Laughs]

- Well, he certainly was
very good-looking.
- Who?

- Yes, he's a nice creature.
- <i>Have you known him long?</i>

- Yes, he is.

00:10:37,244 --> 00:10:39,246
I shall disappoint you.
Good night.

150
00:10:39,246 --> 00:10:43,239
Good night. Oh, give my love
to Fred and the children.

151
00:10:52,593 --> 00:10:56,196
- <i>[Man] Is that you, Laura?</i>
- Yes, dear.

152
00:10:56,196 --> 00:10:58,732
<i>Thank goodness you've come back.</i>
<i>The place has been in an uproar.</i>

153
00:10:58,732 --> 00:11:01,769
- Why? What's the matter?
- <i>Bobby and Margaret</i>
<i>have been fighting again.</i>

154
00:11:01,769 --> 00:11:04,371
<i>They won't go to sleep until you go in</i>
<i>and talk to them about it.</i>

155
00:11:04,371 --> 00:11:07,608
- <i>Mummy? Is that you, Mummy?</i>
- Yes, Margaret.

156
00:11:07,608 --> 00:11:11,601
Come upstairs at once, Mummy!
I want to talk to you.

157
00:11:16,450 --> 00:11:20,443
You're both very naughty. You should
have been asleep hours ago. What is it?

158
00:11:21,722 --> 00:11:25,692
Well, Mummy, tomorrow's <i>my</i> birthday,
and I want to go to the circus.

159
00:11:25,692 --> 00:11:29,329
And tomorrow's not Margaret's birthday,
and she wants to go to the pantomime.

160
00:11:29,329 --> 00:11:32,466
My birthday's in June.
There aren't any pantomimes in June.

161
00:11:32,466 --> 00:11:34,635
It's far too late
to discuss it tonight,

162
00:11:34,635 --> 00:11:38,639
and if you don't go to sleep, I shall
tell Daddy not to let you go to either.

163
00:11:38,639 --> 00:11:40,340
Oh, Mummy!

164
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:43,343
Why not take them to both? One
in the afternoon, one in the evening?

165
00:11:43,343 --> 00:11:46,380
You know that's impossible. We shouldn't
get them to bed till all hours,

166
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:48,382
and they'd be tired
and fractious.

167
00:11:48,382 --> 00:11:51,652
Well, then, one on one day
and the other on the other.

168
00:11:51,652 --> 00:11:53,821
You're always accusing <i>me</i>
of spoiling the children.

169
00:11:53,821 --> 00:11:57,624
Their characters would be ruined
in a fortnight if I left them
to your over-tender mercies.

170
00:11:57,624 --> 00:12:00,594
All right, have it
your own way.

171
00:12:00,594 --> 00:12:03,163
- Circus or pantomime?
- Neither.

172
00:12:03,163 --> 00:12:05,599
We'll thrash them both soundly,
lock them up in the attic...

173
00:12:05,599 --> 00:12:09,592
<i>and go to the pictures</i>
<i>by ourselves.</i>

174
00:12:12,339 --> 00:12:14,341
[Crying]
Oh, Fred.

175
00:12:14,341 --> 00:12:18,334
- What on earth's the matter?
- Nothing. It's nothing.

176
00:12:19,246 --> 00:12:21,248
Darling, what's wrong?

177
00:12:21,248 --> 00:12:25,219
- Tell me, please.
- Really and truly, it's nothing.

178
00:12:25,219 --> 00:12:27,821
I'm just a little rundown,
that's all.

179
00:12:27,821 --> 00:12:31,358
I had a sort of fainting spell
at the refreshment room at Milford.

180
00:12:31,358 --> 00:12:34,128
Isn't it idiotic?
Dolly Messiter was with me,

181
00:12:34,128 --> 00:12:37,431
and she talked and talked and talked
until I wanted to strangle her.

182
00:12:37,431 --> 00:12:39,833
Still, she meant to be kind.

183
00:12:39,833 --> 00:12:42,369
Isn't it awful about people
meaning to be kind?

184
00:12:42,369 --> 00:12:46,140
- Would you like to go to bed?
- No, Fred, really.

185
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:48,642
Come and sit by the fire
in the library and relax.

186
00:12:48,642 --> 00:12:51,345
You can help me
with the <i>Times</i> crossword.

187
00:12:51,345 --> 00:12:55,338
- You have the most
peculiar ideas of relaxation.
- That's better.

188
00:12:55,415 --> 00:12:59,408
- There you are, darling.
- Thank you.

189
00:12:59,453 --> 00:13:01,722
But why a fainting spell?
I can't understand it.

190
00:13:01,722 --> 00:13:04,725
Don't be silly, darling. I've often
had fainting spells, and you know it.

191
00:13:04,725 --> 00:13:08,195
Don't you remember Bobby's
school concert and Eileen's wedding...

192
00:13:08,195 --> 00:13:11,565
and that time you insisted
on taking me to that symphony
concert at the town hall?

193
00:13:11,565 --> 00:13:13,667
Go on, that was a nosebleed.

194
00:13:13,667 --> 00:13:17,271
I suppose I must be that type of woman.
It's very humiliating.

195
00:13:17,271 --> 00:13:19,873
I still maintain there'd be no harm
in you seeing Dr. Graves.

196
00:13:19,873 --> 00:13:22,476
- It would be a waste of time.
- <i>Now, listen...</i>

197
00:13:22,476 --> 00:13:25,812
Do shut up about it, darling.
You're making a fuss about nothing.

198
00:13:25,812 --> 00:13:29,805
I'd been shopping and was tired.
The refreshment room was hot,
and I suddenly felt sick.

199
00:13:30,317 --> 00:13:33,187
- Nothing more than that.
- All right.

200
00:13:33,187 --> 00:13:36,990
Really nothing more than that.
Now you get on with your puzzle
and leave me in peace.

201
00:13:36,990 --> 00:13:40,794
Have it your own way.

202
00:13:40,794 --> 00:13:44,665
You're a poetry addict. See if you can
help me over this. It's Keats.

203
00:13:44,665 --> 00:13:46,667
"When I behold
upon the night starred face...

204
00:13:46,667 --> 00:13:50,660
huge cloudy symbols of a high"...
something in seven letters.

205
00:13:50,938 --> 00:13:54,942
Romance, I think.
I'm almost sure it is.

206
00:13:54,942 --> 00:13:58,935
"Huge cloudy symbols of a high romance."
It'll be in the <i>Oxford Book of Verse.</i>

207
00:13:59,012 --> 00:14:03,005
No, that's right, I'm sure,
because it fits in with
"delirium" and "Baluchistan."

208
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:10,813
- Would some music
throw you off your stride?
- <i>No, dear, I'd like it.</i>

209
00:14:14,494 --> 00:14:17,297
## [Big Band]

210
00:14:17,297 --> 00:14:19,366
[Man Chattering]

211
00:14:19,366 --> 00:14:23,359
## [Classical]

212
00:15:12,886 --> 00:15:15,389
<i>[Laura's Voice] Fred.</i>

213
00:15:15,389 --> 00:15:17,858
<i>Fred,</i>

214
00:15:17,858 --> 00:15:20,527
<i>dear Fred.</i>

215
00:15:20,527 --> 00:15:24,031
<i>There's so much</i>
<i>that I want to say to you.</i>

216
00:15:24,031 --> 00:15:28,024
<i>You're the only one in the world</i>
<i>with enough wisdom</i>
<i>and gentleness to understand.</i>

217
00:15:29,336 --> 00:15:33,329
<i>If only it were</i>
<i>somebody else's story and not mine.</i>

218
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:37,533
<i>As it is, you are the only one</i>
<i>in the world that I can never tell.</i>

219
00:15:37,678 --> 00:15:39,913
<i>Never, never.</i>

220
00:15:39,913 --> 00:15:43,906
<i>Because even if I waited until we were</i>
<i>old, old people and told you then,</i>

221
00:15:44,618 --> 00:15:48,455
<i>you'd be bound to look back</i>
<i>over the years and be hurt,</i>

222
00:15:48,455 --> 00:15:51,425
<i>and, oh, my dear,</i>
<i>I don't want you to be hurt.</i>

223
00:15:51,425 --> 00:15:55,418
<i>You see, we are</i>
<i>a happily married couple...</i>

224
00:15:56,463 --> 00:15:59,399
<i>and must never forget that.</i>

225
00:15:59,399 --> 00:16:03,392
<i>This is my home.</i>
<i>You are my husband,</i>

226
00:16:04,338 --> 00:16:06,373
<i>and my children</i>
<i>are upstairs in bed.</i>

227
00:16:06,373 --> 00:16:10,366
<i>I am a happily married woman...</i>

228
00:16:10,510 --> 00:16:14,514
<i>or, rather, I was</i>
<i>until a few weeks ago.</i>

229
00:16:14,514 --> 00:16:16,983
<i>This is my whole world,</i>

230
00:16:16,983 --> 00:16:19,353
<i>and it's enough...</i>

231
00:16:19,353 --> 00:16:23,346
<i>or, rather, it was,</i>
<i>until a few weeks ago.</i>

232
00:16:23,523 --> 00:16:27,060
<i>But, oh, Fred,</i>
<i>I've been so foolish.</i>

233
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:29,696
<i>I've fallen in love.</i>

234
00:16:29,696 --> 00:16:32,466
<i>I'm an ordinary woman.</i>

235
00:16:32,466 --> 00:16:36,459
<i>I didn't think such violent things</i>
<i>could happen to ordinary people.</i>

236
00:16:37,704 --> 00:16:40,907
<i>It all started</i>
<i>on an ordinary day,</i>

237
00:16:40,907 --> 00:16:43,710
<i>in the most ordinary place</i>
<i>in the world,</i>

238
00:16:43,710 --> 00:16:47,514
<i>the refreshment room</i>
<i>at Milford Junction.</i>

239
00:16:47,514 --> 00:16:49,750
<i>I was having a cup of tea...</i>

240
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:52,519
<i>and reading a book that I'd got</i>
<i>that morning from Boots.</i>

241
00:16:52,519 --> 00:16:54,955
<i>My train wasn't due</i>
<i>for ten minutes.</i>

242
00:16:54,955 --> 00:16:58,948
<i>I looked up and saw a man</i>
<i>come in from the platform.</i>

243
00:16:59,593 --> 00:17:03,586
<i>He had on an ordinary mac.</i>
<i>His hat was turned down,</i>
<i>and I didn't even see his face.</i>

244
00:17:04,498 --> 00:17:06,566
<i>He got his tea at the counter</i>
<i>and turned.</i>

245
00:17:06,566 --> 00:17:09,202
<i>Then I did see his face.</i>
<i>It was rather a nice face.</i>

246
00:17:09,202 --> 00:17:11,505
- Any sugar? Thank you.
- In the spoon.

247
00:17:11,505 --> 00:17:14,941
- <i>He passed my table on the way to his.</i>
- <i>You're neglecting your duty.</i>

248
00:17:14,941 --> 00:17:17,711
<i>The woman at the counter</i>
<i>was going on as usual.</i>

249
00:17:17,711 --> 00:17:21,214
<i>You know, I told you about her the other</i>
<i>day... the one with the refined voice.</i>

250
00:17:21,214 --> 00:17:24,184
- Minnie hasn't touched her milk.
- Did you put it down for her?

251
00:17:24,184 --> 00:17:26,853
Yes, but she never came for it.

252
00:17:26,853 --> 00:17:29,156
- Fond of animals?
- In their place.

253
00:17:29,156 --> 00:17:31,792
My landlady's got
a positive mania for animals.

254
00:17:31,792 --> 00:17:34,127
She's got two cats...
one Manx, one ordinary...

255
00:17:34,127 --> 00:17:37,931
three rabbits in a hutch
in the kitchen... they belong
to her little boy by rights...

256
00:17:37,931 --> 00:17:40,834
and one of those dark-looking dogs
with hair over its eyes.

257
00:17:40,834 --> 00:17:42,836
I don't know
to what breed you refer.

258
00:17:42,836 --> 00:17:45,105
[Laughing]
I don't think it knows itself.

259
00:17:45,105 --> 00:17:49,098
- <i>[Bell Ringing]</i>
- <i>Go and clean off number three,</i>
<i>I can see crumbs from here.</i>

260
00:17:49,876 --> 00:17:53,869
<i>What about my other cup?</i>
<i>I'll have to be moving.</i>
<i>The 5:40 will be in in a minute.</i>

261
00:17:54,114 --> 00:17:58,107
- <i>Who's on the gate?</i>
- <i>Young William.</i>

262
00:18:23,043 --> 00:18:27,036
Please, a glass of water.
I've got something in my eye,
and I want to bathe it.

263
00:18:28,215 --> 00:18:31,551
- Would you like me to look?
- Oh, no, don't trouble.
I expect the water will do.

264
00:18:31,551 --> 00:18:34,221
- Thank you.
- Bit of coal dust, I expect.

265
00:18:34,221 --> 00:18:37,691
A man I knew lost the sight in one eye
through getting a bit of grit in it.

266
00:18:37,691 --> 00:18:39,693
- Nasty, very nasty.
- Better?

267
00:18:39,693 --> 00:18:42,863
- I'm afraid not. Ooh.
- Can I help you?

268
00:18:42,863 --> 00:18:44,865
Oh, no, please,
it's only something in my eye.

269
00:18:44,865 --> 00:18:48,835
- Try pulling your eyelid down
as far as it'll go.
- And then blowing your nose.

270
00:18:48,835 --> 00:18:51,938
- Please let me look.
I happen to be a doctor.
- It's very kind of you.

271
00:18:51,938 --> 00:18:54,541
Turn around
to the light, please.

272
00:18:54,541 --> 00:18:57,544
Now look up.

273
00:18:57,544 --> 00:19:01,314
Now look down.

274
00:19:01,314 --> 00:19:05,307
Keep still. I see it.

275
00:19:06,553 --> 00:19:08,889
- There.
- Oh, what a relief. It was agonizing.

276
00:19:08,889 --> 00:19:12,592
- It looks like a bit of grit.
- The express went through.
Thank you very much, indeed.

277
00:19:12,592 --> 00:19:14,928
- <i>There we go. I must run.</i>
- How lucky for me
you happened to be here.

278
00:19:14,928 --> 00:19:17,898
- Anybody could've done it.
- Never mind, you did,
and I'm most grateful.

279
00:19:17,898 --> 00:19:21,891
- There's my train. I must go. Good-bye.
- Good-bye.

280
00:19:25,171 --> 00:19:27,173
<i>[Laura's Voice]</i>
<i>That's how it all began...</i>

281
00:19:27,173 --> 00:19:31,166
<i>just through me getting</i>
<i>a little piece of grit in my eye.</i>

282
00:19:31,244 --> 00:19:35,237
<i>I completely forgot the whole incident.</i>
<i>It didn't mean anything to me at all...</i>

283
00:19:35,882 --> 00:19:39,875
<i>at least</i>
<i>I didn't think it did.</i>

284
00:19:44,124 --> 00:19:48,117
<i>The next Thursday I went</i>
<i>into Milford again, as usual.</i>

285
00:19:57,170 --> 00:19:59,205
<i>I changed my book at Boots.</i>

286
00:19:59,205 --> 00:20:02,242
<i>Miss Lewis had at last managed</i>
<i>to get the new Kate O'Brien for me.</i>

287
00:20:02,242 --> 00:20:05,378
<i>I believe she'd kept it hidden</i>
<i>under the counter for two days.</i>

288
00:20:05,378 --> 00:20:08,748
<i>On the way out, I bought</i>
<i>two new toothbrushes for the children.</i>

289
00:20:08,748 --> 00:20:11,351
<i>I like the smell of a chemist's</i>
<i>better than any other shop.</i>

290
00:20:11,351 --> 00:20:15,322
<i>It's such a mixture of nice things...</i>
<i>herbs and scent and soap.</i>

291
00:20:15,322 --> 00:20:18,291
<i>That awful Mrs. Leftwich</i>
<i>was at the other end of the counter...</i>

292
00:20:18,291 --> 00:20:20,293
<i>wearing one of the silliest hats</i>
<i>I've ever seen.</i>

293
00:20:20,293 --> 00:20:20,393
<i>Wearing one of the silliest hats</i>
<i>I've ever seen.</i>

294
00:20:20,393 --> 00:20:24,386
<i>Fortunately, she didn't look up, so</i>
<i>I got out without her buttonholing me.</i>

295
00:20:25,732 --> 00:20:27,734
<i>Just as I stepped out</i>
<i>onto the pavement...</i>

296
00:20:27,734 --> 00:20:30,070
- Good morning. How's the eye?
- Oh, Good morning.

297
00:20:30,070 --> 00:20:32,739
Perfectly all right. How kind it was
of you to take so much trouble.

298
00:20:32,739 --> 00:20:36,732
- It was nothing at all.
It's clearing up I think.
- Yes, it's going to be nice.

299
00:20:37,010 --> 00:20:40,413
- Well, I must be getting along
to the hospital.
- And I to the grocers.

300
00:20:40,413 --> 00:20:44,406
- What exciting lives we lead,
don't we? Good-bye.
- Good-bye.

301
00:20:45,352 --> 00:20:48,421
<i>[Laura's Voice] That evening I had to</i>
<i>run nearly all the way to the station.</i>

302
00:20:48,421 --> 00:20:51,124
<i>I'd been to the Palladium, as usual,</i>
<i>but it was a terribly long film.</i>

303
00:20:51,124 --> 00:20:53,893
<i>I was afraid I'd be late.</i>

304
00:20:53,893 --> 00:20:57,886
<i>As I came up onto the platform,</i>
<i>the Churley train was just puffing out.</i>

305
00:20:58,131 --> 00:21:02,124
<i>I looked up idly as the windows</i>
<i>of the carriages went by,</i>
<i>wondering if he was there.</i>

306
00:21:03,269 --> 00:21:06,339
<i>I remember this crossing my mind</i>
<i>but it was quite unimportant.</i>

307
00:21:06,339 --> 00:21:08,742
<i>I was really thinking</i>
<i>of other things.</i>

308
00:21:08,742 --> 00:21:11,778
<i>The present for your birthday</i>
<i>was worrying me rather.</i>

309
00:21:11,778 --> 00:21:14,247
<i>It was terribly expensive,</i>
<i>but I knew you wanted it,</i>

310
00:21:14,247 --> 00:21:17,283
<i>and I sort of half taken the plunge</i>
<i>and left a deposit on it...</i>

311
00:21:17,283 --> 00:21:20,954
<i>at Spink and Robson's</i>
<i>until the next Thursday,</i>

312
00:21:20,954 --> 00:21:23,690
<i>the next Thursday.</i>

313
00:21:23,690 --> 00:21:27,683
<i>Well, I squared my conscience</i>
<i>by thinking how pleased</i>
<i>you would be and bought it.</i>

314
00:21:27,761 --> 00:21:29,329
- Yes, I'll have it.
- Thank you, madam.

315
00:21:29,329 --> 00:21:32,832
<i>It was wildly extravagant,</i>
<i>I know, but having committed the crime,</i>

316
00:21:32,832 --> 00:21:35,402
<i>I suddenly felt</i>
<i>reckless and gay.</i>

317
00:21:35,402 --> 00:21:39,395
<i>The sun was out, and everybody in the</i>
<i>street looked more cheerful than usual,</i>

318
00:21:39,739 --> 00:21:42,075
<i>and there was a barrel organ</i>
<i>at the corner by Harris's,</i>

319
00:21:42,075 --> 00:21:44,411
<i>and you know how I love</i>
<i>barrel organs.</i>

320
00:21:44,411 --> 00:21:47,480
<i>It was playing</i>
<i>"Let the Great Big World Keep Turning,"</i>

321
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:51,473
<i>and I gave the man sixpence</i>
<i>and went to the Kardomah for lunch.</i>

322
00:21:52,185 --> 00:21:56,178
<i>It was very full, but two people had got</i>
<i>up from the tablejust as I had come in.</i>

323
00:21:56,356 --> 00:21:59,993
<i>That was a bit of luck,</i>
<i>wasn't it? Or was it?</i>

324
00:21:59,993 --> 00:22:02,495
<i>Just after I had given my order,</i>
<i>I saw him come in.</i>

325
00:22:02,495 --> 00:22:06,132
<i>He looked a little tired, I thought,</i>
<i>and there was nowhere for him to sit,</i>

326
00:22:06,132 --> 00:22:08,334
- <i>so I smiled and said...</i>
- Good morning.

327
00:22:08,334 --> 00:22:12,272
- Oh, good morning. Are you all alone?
- Yes, I am.

328
00:22:12,272 --> 00:22:16,265
- Would you mind if I shared your table?
It's very full.
- No, of course not.

329
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:23,149
I'm afraid we haven't been introduced
properly. My name's Alec Harvey.

330
00:22:23,149 --> 00:22:26,086
How do you do?
Mine's Laura Jesson.

331
00:22:26,086 --> 00:22:28,455
- Mrs. Or Miss?
- Mrs.

332
00:22:28,455 --> 00:22:31,891
- You're a doctor, aren't you?
I remember you said so that day
in the refreshment room.
- Yes.

333
00:22:31,891 --> 00:22:35,395
Not a very interesting one. Just an
ordinary G.P. My practice is in Churley.

334
00:22:35,395 --> 00:22:38,531
- Yes, sir? Excuse me, sir?
- What did you plump for?

335
00:22:38,531 --> 00:22:41,501
Um, the soup and fried sole.

336
00:22:41,501 --> 00:22:43,970
- Yes, I'll have the same.
- Anything to drink?

337
00:22:43,970 --> 00:22:46,206
No, thank you. That is,
would you like anything to drink?

338
00:22:46,206 --> 00:22:49,476
- No, thank you. Just plain water.
- Plain water, please.

339
00:22:49,476 --> 00:22:53,469
<i>## [Clasical Trio]</i>

340
00:22:58,485 --> 00:23:02,478
Will you just look
at the cellist?

341
00:23:08,094 --> 00:23:10,430
[Laughing]
It really is dreadful, isn't it?

342
00:23:10,430 --> 00:23:12,766
But we oughtn't laugh.
They might see.

343
00:23:12,766 --> 00:23:16,102
There should be a society
for the prevention of cruelty
to musical instruments.

344
00:23:16,102 --> 00:23:18,838
- You don't play the piano, I hope?
- I was forced to as a child.

345
00:23:18,838 --> 00:23:21,541
- You haven't kept it up?
- No, my husband isn't musical at all.

346
00:23:21,541 --> 00:23:25,445
- Good for him.
- For all you know, I might have
a tremendous burning talent.

347
00:23:25,445 --> 00:23:28,448
- Oh, dear, no.
- Why are you so sure?

348
00:23:28,448 --> 00:23:31,918
You're too sane
and uncomplicated.

349
00:23:31,918 --> 00:23:35,155
I suppose it's a good thing
to be uncomplicated
but it does sound a little dull.

350
00:23:35,155 --> 00:23:38,158
You could never be dull.

351
00:23:38,158 --> 00:23:41,995
- Do you come here every Thursday?
- Yes, to spend a day at hospital.

352
00:23:41,995 --> 00:23:44,864
Stephen Lynn, the chief physician here
graduated with me.

353
00:23:44,864 --> 00:23:47,967
I take over from him once a week.
Gives him a chance to go to London.

354
00:23:47,967 --> 00:23:51,271
- Gives me a chance
to study the hospital patients.
- I see.

355
00:23:51,271 --> 00:23:53,406
- Do you?
- Do I what?

356
00:23:53,406 --> 00:23:57,399
- Come here every Thursday?
- Yes, I do the week's shopping.
Thank you.

357
00:23:58,077 --> 00:24:01,581
Change my library book, have lunch
and generally go to the pictures.

358
00:24:01,581 --> 00:24:05,574
Not a very exciting routine,
but it makes a change.

359
00:24:05,952 --> 00:24:09,422
- Are you going to the pictures
this afternoon?
- Yes.

360
00:24:09,422 --> 00:24:12,192
How extraordinary.
So am I.

361
00:24:12,192 --> 00:24:14,194
I thought you had to spend
all day at the hospital.

362
00:24:14,194 --> 00:24:17,964
Well, between ourselves, I killed
two patients by accident this morning.

363
00:24:17,964 --> 00:24:21,957
The matron's very displeased with me.
I simply daren't go back.

364
00:24:22,101 --> 00:24:25,939
- How can you be so silly?
- Seriously, I did get through
most of my work this morning.

365
00:24:25,939 --> 00:24:29,242
It won't matter at all if I play truant.
Would you mind if I came with you?

366
00:24:29,242 --> 00:24:33,235
- Well, l...
- I could sit downstairs,
and you could sit upstairs.

367
00:24:33,613 --> 00:24:37,606
- Upstairs is too expensive.
- <i>## [Stops]</i>

368
00:24:37,951 --> 00:24:40,453
<i>The orchestra stopped</i>
<i>as abruptly as it had started,</i>

369
00:24:40,453 --> 00:24:42,455
<i>and we began to laugh again.</i>

370
00:24:42,455 --> 00:24:45,291
<i>I had no premonitions,</i>
<i>although I suppose I should have had.</i>

371
00:24:45,291 --> 00:24:48,595
<i>It all seemed so natural</i>
<i>and so innocent.</i>

372
00:24:48,595 --> 00:24:52,198
<i>We finished lunch, and that idiot of</i>
<i>a waitress had put the bill all on one.</i>

373
00:24:52,198 --> 00:24:54,534
- I really must insist.
- I couldn't possibly.

374
00:24:54,534 --> 00:24:57,103
Having forced my company on you,
it's only fair I pay.

375
00:24:57,103 --> 00:25:00,039
Please, don't insist.
I should so much rather we halved it.

376
00:25:00,039 --> 00:25:03,276
- I would really, please.
- I shall give in gracefully.

377
00:25:03,276 --> 00:25:07,269
<i>We halved it meticulously.</i>
<i>We even halved the tip.</i>

378
00:25:11,417 --> 00:25:15,410
<i>## [Orchestra]</i>

379
00:25:18,057 --> 00:25:21,194
Thank you.

380
00:25:21,194 --> 00:25:24,330
We have two choices: <i>The Loves</i>
<i>of Cardinal Richelieu</i> at the Palace...

381
00:25:24,330 --> 00:25:26,466
- or <i>Love in a Mist</i> at the Palladium.
- You're very knowledgeable.

382
00:25:26,466 --> 00:25:29,936
There must be no argument about buying
the tickets. We each pay for ourselves.

383
00:25:29,936 --> 00:25:32,472
You must think me a poor doctor
if I can't afford a couple
of one-and-ninepennies.

384
00:25:32,472 --> 00:25:34,641
- I insist.
- I hoped you were going to treat me.

385
00:25:34,641 --> 00:25:37,510
- Which is it: Palace or Palladium?
- Palladium.

386
00:25:37,510 --> 00:25:41,314
I was once very sick on a channel
steamer called <i>Cardinal Richelieu.</i>

387
00:25:41,314 --> 00:25:42,015
<i>## [Movie]</i>

388
00:25:42,015 --> 00:25:46,008
<i>## [Movie]</i>

389
00:26:04,137 --> 00:26:08,130
- [Screaming]
- [Shouting]

390
00:26:22,021 --> 00:26:25,291
Excuse me.

391
00:26:25,291 --> 00:26:27,961
I feel awfully grand perched up here.
It was very extravagant of you.

392
00:26:27,961 --> 00:26:30,430
- It was a famous victory.
- Do you feel guilty as all? I do.

393
00:26:30,430 --> 00:26:34,067
- Guilty?
- You ought to more than me.
You neglected your work.

394
00:26:34,067 --> 00:26:37,503
I worked this morning. A little
relaxation never did harm to anyone.

395
00:26:37,503 --> 00:26:39,639
Why should either of us
feel guilty?

396
00:26:39,639 --> 00:26:43,632
- I don't know.
- How awfully nice you are.

397
00:26:56,990 --> 00:27:00,093
It can't be.

398
00:27:00,093 --> 00:27:02,095
It is.

399
00:27:02,095 --> 00:27:05,131
[Both Laughing]

400
00:27:05,131 --> 00:27:07,533
<i>We walked back</i>
<i>to the station together.</i>

401
00:27:07,533 --> 00:27:11,337
<i>Just as we reached the gates,</i>
<i>he put his hand under my arm.</i>

402
00:27:11,337 --> 00:27:14,674
<i>I didn't notice it then,</i>
<i>but I remember it now.</i>

403
00:27:14,674 --> 00:27:17,543
- What's she like... your wife?
- Madeleine?

404
00:27:17,543 --> 00:27:20,713
Small, dark,
rather delicate.

405
00:27:20,713 --> 00:27:22,782
How funny. I should have thought
she would've been fair.

406
00:27:22,782 --> 00:27:25,084
And your husband?
What's he like?

407
00:27:25,084 --> 00:27:29,077
Medium height, brown hair, kindly,
unemotional and not delicate at all.

408
00:27:29,455 --> 00:27:31,791
- You said that proudly.
- Did I?

409
00:27:31,791 --> 00:27:33,793
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

410
00:27:33,793 --> 00:27:36,529
We've just got time for a cup of tea
before our trains go.

411
00:27:36,529 --> 00:27:40,233
And for the third time in one week, he
brought that common man and his wife...

412
00:27:40,233 --> 00:27:42,502
to the house without so much as
a "by your leave."

413
00:27:42,502 --> 00:27:45,438
- Two teas, please.
- Cake or pastry?

414
00:27:45,438 --> 00:27:47,707
- Cake or pastry?
- <i>No, thank you.</i>

415
00:27:47,707 --> 00:27:50,743
- Are those Bath buns fresh?
- Certainly they are. Made this morning.

416
00:27:50,743 --> 00:27:54,213
Two, please.

417
00:27:54,213 --> 00:27:57,150
That'll be sevenpence.

418
00:27:57,150 --> 00:28:01,143
- Take the tea to the table, Beryl.
- I'll carry the buns.

419
00:28:05,258 --> 00:28:07,260
You must eat one of these.
Fresh this morning.

420
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:09,562
- Very fattening.
- I don't hold to such foolishness.

421
00:28:09,562 --> 00:28:13,555
- They do look good, I must say.
- One of my earliest passions in life...
never outgrown it.

422
00:28:13,599 --> 00:28:16,736
- <i>What happened then, Mrs. Bagot?</i>
- <i>Well...</i>

423
00:28:16,736 --> 00:28:16,869
- <i>What happened then, Mrs. Bagot?</i>
- <i>Well...</i>

424
00:28:16,869 --> 00:28:20,239
Well, it's all very fine, I said,
expecting me to do this,
that and that other,

425
00:28:20,239 --> 00:28:22,241
but what do I get out of it?

426
00:28:22,241 --> 00:28:25,845
You can't expect me to be a cook,
housekeeper and char during the day...

427
00:28:25,845 --> 00:28:29,082
and a loving wife in the evening,
just because you feel like it.

428
00:28:29,082 --> 00:28:33,075
Oh, dear me, no. There are just as good
fish in the sea as ever came out of it.

429
00:28:33,853 --> 00:28:36,255
And I packed me boxes
then and there and left him.

430
00:28:36,255 --> 00:28:39,158
- Didn't you never go back?
- Never.

431
00:28:39,158 --> 00:28:41,727
Went to my sister's place
at Folkestone for a bit.

432
00:28:41,727 --> 00:28:45,398
Then I went in with a friend of mine,
and we opened a tea shop in Hythe.

433
00:28:45,398 --> 00:28:49,135
- What happened to him?
- Dead as a doornail inside three years.

434
00:28:49,135 --> 00:28:52,405
Well, I never.

435
00:28:52,405 --> 00:28:55,408
Is tea bad for one?
Worse than coffee, I mean?

436
00:28:55,408 --> 00:28:58,244
If this is a professional interview,
my fee is a guinea.

437
00:28:58,244 --> 00:29:02,115
- Why did you become a doctor?
- That's a long story.

438
00:29:02,115 --> 00:29:06,108
- Perhaps because I'm an idealist.
- I should think all doctors
ought to have ideals.

439
00:29:06,185 --> 00:29:09,255
- Otherwise their work
would be unbearable.
- Encouraging me to talk shop?

440
00:29:09,255 --> 00:29:11,591
It's what interests you most.

441
00:29:11,591 --> 00:29:15,561
Yes, it is.
I'm terribly ambitious really.

442
00:29:15,561 --> 00:29:18,631
Not ambitious for myself
so much as for my special pigeon.

443
00:29:18,631 --> 00:29:21,467
- What is your special pigeon?
- Preventive medicine.

444
00:29:21,467 --> 00:29:24,370
- I see.
- I'm afraid you don't.

445
00:29:24,370 --> 00:29:27,406
- I was trying to be intelligent.
- Most good doctors,

446
00:29:27,406 --> 00:29:29,575
especially when they're young,
have private dreams.

447
00:29:29,575 --> 00:29:31,777
That's the best part of them.
Sometimes, though,

448
00:29:31,777 --> 00:29:34,247
those get over-professionalized
and strangulated... am I boring you?

449
00:29:34,247 --> 00:29:37,150
No, I don't quite understand,
but you're not boring me.

450
00:29:37,150 --> 00:29:41,143
What I mean is this: All good doctors
must primarily be enthusiasts.

451
00:29:42,388 --> 00:29:45,491
They must, like writers
and painters and priests...

452
00:29:45,491 --> 00:29:47,493
they must have
a sense of vocation,

453
00:29:47,493 --> 00:29:51,264
- a deep-rooted, unsentimental
desire to do good.
- Yes, I see that.

454
00:29:51,264 --> 00:29:54,567
Well, obviously one way of preventing
disease is worth 50 ways of curing it.

455
00:29:54,567 --> 00:29:56,569
That's where my ideal comes in.

456
00:29:56,569 --> 00:29:58,804
Preventive medicine isn't
anything to do with medicine at all.

457
00:29:58,804 --> 00:30:02,797
It's concerned with conditions... living
conditions, hygiene and common sense.

458
00:30:03,376 --> 00:30:05,378
For instance,
my speciality is pneumoconiosis.

459
00:30:05,378 --> 00:30:09,371
- Oh, dear.
- Don't be alarmed.
It's simpler than it sounds.

460
00:30:10,550 --> 00:30:12,919
It's nothing but a slow process
of fibrosis of the lung...

461
00:30:12,919 --> 00:30:15,488
due to the inhalation
of particles of dust.

462
00:30:15,488 --> 00:30:18,791
In the hospital here there are
splendid opportunities for
observing cures, making notes...

463
00:30:18,791 --> 00:30:22,261
- because of the coal mines.
- You suddenly look much younger.

464
00:30:22,261 --> 00:30:26,254
- Do I?
- Almost like a little boy.

465
00:30:26,332 --> 00:30:28,968
What made you say that?

466
00:30:28,968 --> 00:30:32,605
I don't know. Yes, I do.

467
00:30:32,605 --> 00:30:35,241
Tell me.

468
00:30:35,241 --> 00:30:39,234
Oh, no, I couldn't, really.
You were saying about the coal mines.

469
00:30:40,246 --> 00:30:44,239
Oh, yes, the inhalation
of coal dust.

470
00:30:44,550 --> 00:30:48,543
<i>That's one specific form of the disease.</i>
<i>It's called anthracosis.</i>

471
00:30:49,755 --> 00:30:52,491
What are the others?

472
00:30:52,491 --> 00:30:56,362
<i>Chalicosis...</i>
<i>that comes from metal dust...</i>

473
00:30:56,362 --> 00:30:58,598
<i>steel works, you know.</i>

474
00:30:58,598 --> 00:31:00,900
Yes, of course, steel works.

475
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:03,936
And silicosis...

476
00:31:03,936 --> 00:31:07,929
that's stone dust...
gold mines.

477
00:31:09,008 --> 00:31:11,944
- I see.
- <i>[Bell Ringing]</i>

478
00:31:11,944 --> 00:31:14,447
- There's your train.
- Yes.

479
00:31:14,447 --> 00:31:17,450
- You mustn't miss it.
- No.

480
00:31:17,450 --> 00:31:21,443
- What's the matter?
- Nothing. Nothing at all, really.

481
00:31:22,021 --> 00:31:24,357
It's been so very nice.
I've enjoyed my afternoon enormously.

482
00:31:24,357 --> 00:31:27,760
I'm so glad. So have I. I apologize
for boring you with long medical words.

483
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:31,731
I feel dull and stupid
not to be able to understand more.

484
00:31:31,731 --> 00:31:34,066
Shall I see you again?

485
00:31:34,066 --> 00:31:37,903
It's the other platform, isn't it?
You'll have to run.
Don't bother about me.

486
00:31:37,903 --> 00:31:41,896
- Shall I see you again?
- Yes, of course. Perhaps you'd
come to Ketchworth one Sunday.

487
00:31:41,974 --> 00:31:45,278
- It's rather far, I know,
but we should be delighted.
- Please, please.

488
00:31:45,278 --> 00:31:49,015
- What is it?
- Next Thursday, the same time.

489
00:31:49,015 --> 00:31:51,584
- No, I couldn't possibly.
- <i>Please.</i>

490
00:31:51,584 --> 00:31:54,453
I ask you most humbly.

491
00:31:54,453 --> 00:31:58,446
- <i>You'll miss your train.</i>
- All right.

492
00:31:58,691 --> 00:32:01,594
- Run. I'll be there.
- Good-bye.

493
00:32:01,594 --> 00:32:05,587
Thank you, my dear.

494
00:32:31,490 --> 00:32:35,483
<i>I stood there and watched</i>
<i>his train draw out of the station.</i>

495
00:32:36,762 --> 00:32:40,755
<i>I stared after it until its taillight</i>
<i>had vanished into the darkness.</i>

496
00:32:44,937 --> 00:32:47,640
<i>I imagined him getting out</i>
<i>at Churley,</i>

497
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:50,109
<i>giving up his ticket,</i>

498
00:32:50,109 --> 00:32:52,778
<i>walking back</i>
<i>through the streets,</i>

499
00:32:52,778 --> 00:32:56,615
<i>letting himself into his house</i>
<i>with his latchkey.</i>

500
00:32:56,615 --> 00:33:00,553
<i>His wife... Madeleine...</i>

501
00:33:00,553 --> 00:33:04,490
<i>would probably be in the hall</i>
<i>to meet him.</i>

502
00:33:04,490 --> 00:33:08,483
<i>Or perhaps upstairs in her room,</i>
<i>not feeling very well.</i>

503
00:33:08,728 --> 00:33:12,598
<i>"Small, dark</i>
<i>and rather delicate. "</i>

504
00:33:12,598 --> 00:33:15,167
<i>I wondered if he'd say,</i>

505
00:33:15,167 --> 00:33:18,104
<i>"I met such a nice woman</i>
<i>at the Kardomah.</i>

506
00:33:18,104 --> 00:33:22,097
<i>We had lunch</i>
<i>and went to the pictures. "</i>

507
00:33:22,675 --> 00:33:24,744
<i>Then suddenly,</i>
<i>I knew that he wouldn't.</i>

508
00:33:24,744 --> 00:33:27,480
<i>I knew beyond a shadow of doubt</i>
<i>that he wouldn't say a word,</i>

509
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:30,750
<i>At that moment, the first awful feeling</i>
<i>of danger swept over me.</i>

510
00:33:30,750 --> 00:33:34,743
<i>[Train Approaching]</i>

511
00:33:39,592 --> 00:33:41,761
<i>I got into the first compartment</i>
<i>I saw.</i>

512
00:33:41,761 --> 00:33:44,997
<i>I wanted to get home</i>
<i>as quickly as possible.</i>

513
00:33:44,997 --> 00:33:48,868
<i>I looked hurriedly around the carriage</i>
<i>to see if anyone was looking at me,</i>

514
00:33:48,868 --> 00:33:51,604
<i>as if they could read</i>
<i>my secret thoughts.</i>

515
00:33:51,604 --> 00:33:54,974
<i>No one was, except a clergyman</i>
<i>in the opposite corner.</i>

516
00:33:54,974 --> 00:33:58,967
<i>I felt myself blushing and opened</i>
<i>my library book and pretended to read.</i>

517
00:34:02,782 --> 00:34:05,017
<i>By the time I'd got to Ketchworth,</i>
<i>I had made up my mind definitely...</i>

518
00:34:05,017 --> 00:34:07,520
- <i>that I wasn't going</i>
<i>to see Alec anymore.</i>
- Good evening, Mrs. Jesson.

519
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:11,457
<i>It was silly and undignified flirting</i>
<i>like that with a complete stranger.</i>

520
00:34:11,457 --> 00:34:13,826
Oh, good evening.

521
00:34:13,826 --> 00:34:16,762
<i>I walked up to the house</i>
<i>quite briskly and cheerfully.</i>

522
00:34:16,762 --> 00:34:20,755
<i>I'd been behaving like an idiot,</i>
<i>admittedly, but after all,</i>
<i>no harm had been done.</i>

523
00:34:22,668 --> 00:34:26,661
<i>You met me in the hall. Your face was</i>
<i>strained and worried, and my heart sank.</i>

524
00:34:26,872 --> 00:34:28,941
Fred, what's the matter?

525
00:34:28,941 --> 00:34:32,611
- It's all right, but you must
keep calm and not be upset.
- What is it? What's wrong?

526
00:34:32,611 --> 00:34:35,047
It's Bobby. He was knocked down
by a car on the way home from school.

527
00:34:35,047 --> 00:34:37,750
Now it's not serious.
He was just grazed by the mudguard,

528
00:34:37,750 --> 00:34:39,819
but it knocked him against the curb,
and he's got slight concussion.

529
00:34:39,819 --> 00:34:43,812
The doctor's upstairs
with him now.

530
00:34:48,627 --> 00:34:50,796
<i>It's all right, Mrs. Jesson.</i>
<i>Nothing to worry about.</i>

531
00:34:50,796 --> 00:34:54,789
<i>He'll be as right as rain</i>
<i>in a few hours.</i>

532
00:34:54,934 --> 00:34:57,536
You're sure?
You're sure it's not serious?

533
00:34:57,536 --> 00:35:01,240
<i>Quite sure, but it was</i>
<i>certainly a very lucky escape.</i>

534
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:03,809
<i>I've given him a little sedative,</i>
<i>and I shall advise...</i>

535
00:35:03,809 --> 00:35:05,811
<i>keeping him at home</i>
<i>for a couple of days.</i>

536
00:35:05,811 --> 00:35:07,813
<i>It must have been a bit of a shock...</i>
<i>[Voice Fades]</i>

537
00:35:07,813 --> 00:35:09,849
<i>[Laura's Voice] I felt so dreadful,</i>
<i>Fred, looking at him, lying there...</i>

538
00:35:09,849 --> 00:35:11,884
<i>with that bandage</i>
<i>round his head.</i>

539
00:35:11,884 --> 00:35:14,987
<i>I tried not to show it,</i>
<i>but I was quite hysterical inside,</i>

540
00:35:14,987 --> 00:35:17,590
<i>as though the whole thing</i>
<i>were my fault...</i>

541
00:35:17,590 --> 00:35:21,583
<i>a sort of punishment,</i>
<i>an awful, sinister warning.</i>

542
00:35:23,028 --> 00:35:26,232
<i>An hour of two later, of course,</i>
<i>everything became quite normal again.</i>

543
00:35:26,232 --> 00:35:28,300
<i>He began to enjoy</i>
<i>the whole thing thoroughly...</i>

544
00:35:28,300 --> 00:35:31,103
<i>and revelled in the fact</i>
<i>that he was the center of attraction.</i>

545
00:35:31,103 --> 00:35:33,105
- Oh, good!
- [Chuckling]

546
00:35:33,105 --> 00:35:37,098
<i>Do you remember how we spent</i>
<i>the whole evening planning his future?</i>

547
00:35:37,643 --> 00:35:39,979
But he's much too young
to decide really.

548
00:35:39,979 --> 00:35:41,981
Good life, if the boy has
a feeling for it.

549
00:35:41,981 --> 00:35:44,817
How can he possibly really know
if he has a feeling for it?

550
00:35:44,817 --> 00:35:47,086
He'll probably want to be
an engine driver next week.

551
00:35:47,086 --> 00:35:49,955
No, it was last week
he wanted to be an engine driver.

552
00:35:49,955 --> 00:35:53,759
It seems so final, somehow, entering
a child of that age for the navy.

553
00:35:53,759 --> 00:35:57,730
- It's a healthy life.
- I know it's a good life,
and I know it's a healthy life,

554
00:35:57,730 --> 00:36:00,633
and I know he'll be able to see the
world and have a wife in every port...

555
00:36:00,633 --> 00:36:03,335
and keep on calling everybody "sir,"
but what about us?

556
00:36:03,335 --> 00:36:06,305
- What do you mean, "What about us?"
- <i>We shall hardly ever see him.</i>

557
00:36:06,305 --> 00:36:09,241
- Oh, nonsense.
- It isn't nonsense.

558
00:36:09,241 --> 00:36:12,077
He'll be sent away to sea
as a smooth-faced boy,

559
00:36:12,077 --> 00:36:15,548
and the next thing we know,
he'll come walking in
with a long beard and a parrot.

560
00:36:15,548 --> 00:36:19,541
I think you take rather
a Victorian view of the navy, my dear.

561
00:36:19,752 --> 00:36:22,988
<i>He's our only son, and I should like</i>
<i>to be there while he's growing up.</i>

562
00:36:22,988 --> 00:36:25,291
All right, old girl.
Then we'll put him into an office,

563
00:36:25,291 --> 00:36:28,060
and you can see him off
on the 8:50 every morning.

564
00:36:28,060 --> 00:36:28,160
And you can see him off
on the 8:50 every morning.

565
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:31,163
You really are very annoying. You know
perfectly well I should hate that.

566
00:36:31,163 --> 00:36:35,156
All right,
have it your own way.

567
00:36:37,102 --> 00:36:41,006
- Fred?
- Hmm?

568
00:36:41,006 --> 00:36:43,709
I had lunch with a strange man today,
and he took me to the movies.

569
00:36:43,709 --> 00:36:47,702
- Good for you.
- He's awfully nice. He's a doctor.

570
00:36:48,781 --> 00:36:52,774
- A very noble profession.
- Oh, dear.

571
00:36:53,986 --> 00:36:57,979
It <i>was</i> Richard III who said,
"My kingdom for a horse," wasn't it?

572
00:36:58,324 --> 00:37:00,326
<i>Yes, darling.</i>

573
00:37:00,326 --> 00:37:03,128
Well, I wish to goodness he hadn't
because it spoils everything.

574
00:37:03,128 --> 00:37:06,999
I thought perhaps we might
ask him to dinner one night.

575
00:37:06,999 --> 00:37:10,992
By all means.
Who?

576
00:37:11,937 --> 00:37:15,140
Dr. Harvey... the one
I was telling you about.

577
00:37:15,140 --> 00:37:17,643
- Must it be dinner?
- Well, you're never at home for lunch.

578
00:37:17,643 --> 00:37:20,746
Exactly.

579
00:37:20,746 --> 00:37:23,882
Oh, Fred.
[Laughing]

580
00:37:23,882 --> 00:37:27,319
Now what on earth's
the matter?

581
00:37:27,319 --> 00:37:31,090
It's nothing.
It's only that... Oh, Fred.

582
00:37:31,090 --> 00:37:33,392
I really don't see
what's so frightfully funny.

583
00:37:33,392 --> 00:37:36,228
Oh, I do. It's all right, darling.
I'm not laughing at you.

584
00:37:36,228 --> 00:37:39,031
I'm laughing at me.
I'm the one that's funny.

585
00:37:39,031 --> 00:37:43,024
I'm an absolute idiot, worrying myself
about things that don't exist...

586
00:37:43,302 --> 00:37:45,804
and making mountains
out of molehills.

587
00:37:45,804 --> 00:37:48,674
I told you when you came in
that it was nothing serious.

588
00:37:48,674 --> 00:37:50,776
<i>There was nothing to get</i>
<i>into such a state about.</i>

589
00:37:50,776 --> 00:37:53,178
I do see that now,
I really do.

590
00:37:53,178 --> 00:37:57,171
[Laughing]

591
00:38:02,254 --> 00:38:04,890
<i>When Thursday came,</i>
<i>I went to meet Alec,</i>

592
00:38:04,890 --> 00:38:07,926
<i>more as a matter of politeness</i>

593
00:38:07,926 --> 00:38:11,919
<i>It didn't seem of any importance,</i>
<i>but, after all, I had promised.</i>

594
00:38:12,698 --> 00:38:15,167

595
00:38:15,167 --> 00:38:18,871

596
00:38:18,871 --> 00:38:22,174
<i>The ladies'orchestra</i>
<i>was playing away, as usual.</i>

597
00:38:22,174 --> 00:38:25,844
<i>I looked at the cellist.</i>
<i>She seemed to be so funny last week,</i>

598
00:38:25,844 --> 00:38:28,414
<i>but today, she didn't seem</i>
<i>funny anymore.</i>

599
00:38:28,414 --> 00:38:31,884
<i>She looked pathetic,</i>
<i>poor thing.</i>

600
00:38:31,884 --> 00:38:35,877
<i>After lunch, I happened to pass</i>
<i>by the hospital.</i>

601
00:38:36,488 --> 00:38:39,692
<i>I remember looking up at the windows</i>
<i>and wondering if he were there...</i>

602
00:38:39,692 --> 00:38:42,861
<i>or whether something awful</i>
<i>had happened to prevent him turning up.</i>

603
00:38:42,861 --> 00:38:45,064
<i>I got to the station</i>

A nice thing if Mr. Saunders happened

<i>I was walking on air.</i>

760
00:49:26,871 --> 00:49:30,864
<i>When I got into the train,</i>
<i>I didn't even pretend to read.</i>

761
00:49:30,942 --> 00:49:34,713
<i>I didn't care whether people were</i>
<i>looking at me or not. I had to think.</i>

762
00:49:34,713 --> 00:49:38,650
<i>I should have been utterly wretched and</i>
<i>ashamed. I know I should, but I wasn't.</i>

763
00:49:38,650 --> 00:49:41,553
<i>I felt suddenly</i>
<i>quite wildly happy,</i>

764
00:49:41,553 --> 00:49:45,546
<i>like a romantic schoolgirl,</i>
<i>like a romantic fool.</i>

765
00:49:45,824 --> 00:49:49,817
<i>You see, he'd said he loved me,</i>
<i>and I had said I loved him.</i>

766
00:49:51,796 --> 00:49:55,500
<i>And it was true.</i>
<i>It was true.</i>

767
00:49:55,500 --> 00:49:58,470
<i>I imagined him holding me</i>
<i>in his arms.</i>

768
00:49:58,470 --> 00:50:01,873
<i>I imagined being with him in all sorts</i>
<i>of glamorous circumstances.</i>

769
00:50:01,873 --> 00:50:05,009
<i>It was one of those absurd fantasies,</i>
<i>just like one has when one is a girl,</i>

770
00:50:05,009 --> 00:50:09,002
<i>being wooed and married</i>
<i>by the ideal of one's dreams.</i>

771
00:50:13,418 --> 00:50:16,888
<i>I stared out of that</i>
<i>railway carriage window into the dark...</i>

772
00:50:16,888 --> 00:50:20,881
<i>and watched the dim trees</i>
<i>and the telegraph posts slipping by,</i>

773
00:50:21,159 --> 00:50:25,152
<i>and through them,</i>
<i>I saw Alec and me.</i>

774
00:50:25,463 --> 00:50:27,799
<i>Alec and me...</i>

775
00:50:27,799 --> 00:50:31,069
<i>perhaps a little younger than we are</i>
<i>now, but just as much in love...</i>

776
00:50:31,069 --> 00:50:35,062
<i>and with nothing in the way.</i>

777
00:50:38,443 --> 00:50:41,646
<i>I saw us in Paris,</i>
<i>in a box at the opera.</i>

778
00:50:41,646 --> 00:50:45,639
<i>The orchestra was tuning up.</i>

779
00:50:48,720 --> 00:50:52,457
<i>Then we were in Venice, drifting along</i>
<i>the Grand Canal in a gondola...</i>

780
00:50:52,457 --> 00:50:56,194
<i>with the sound of mandolins</i>
<i>coming to us over the water.</i>

781
00:50:56,194 --> 00:50:58,830
<i>I saw us traveling</i>
<i>far away together,</i>

782
00:50:58,830 --> 00:51:02,823
<i>all the places</i>
<i>I've always longed to go.</i>

783
00:51:03,768 --> 00:51:07,761
<i>I saw us leaning on the rail of a ship,</i>
<i>looking at the sea and stars,</i>

784
00:51:09,741 --> 00:51:11,843
<i>standing on a tropical beach</i>
<i>in the moonlight...</i>

785
00:51:11,843 --> 00:51:15,146
<i>with the palm trees</i>
<i>sighing above us.</i>

786
00:51:15,146 --> 00:51:18,783
<i>Then the palm trees changed into those</i>
<i>pollarded willows by the canal...</i>

787
00:51:18,783 --> 00:51:21,619
<i>just before the level crossing,</i>

788
00:51:21,619 --> 00:51:24,689
<i>and all the silly dreams</i>
<i>disappeared,</i>

789
00:51:24,689 --> 00:51:28,660
<i>and I got out at Ketchworth</i>
<i>and gave up my ticket...</i>

790
00:51:28,660 --> 00:51:30,962
<i>and walked home as usual,</i>

791
00:51:30,962 --> 00:51:33,131
<i>quite soberly</i>
<i>and without wings...</i>

792
00:51:33,131 --> 00:51:35,600
<i>without any wings at all.</i>

793
00:51:35,600 --> 00:51:38,736
<i>When I had changed for dinner and was</i>
<i>doing my face a bit... Do you remember?</i>

794
00:51:38,736 --> 00:51:41,506
<i>I don't suppose you do,</i>
<i>but I do.</i>

795
00:51:41,506 --> 00:51:43,975
<i>You see, you didn't know that that was</i>
<i>the first time in our life together...</i>

796
00:51:43,975 --> 00:51:46,277
<i>that I had ever lied to you.</i>

797
00:51:46,277 --> 00:51:50,270
<i>It started then...</i>
<i>the shame of the whole thing,</i>

798
00:51:50,715 --> 00:51:54,185
<i>the guiltiness, the fear.</i>

799
00:51:54,185 --> 00:51:58,178
- Good evening, Mrs. Jesson.
- Hello, dear.

800
00:51:58,556 --> 00:52:01,659
- Had a good day?
- Yes, lovely.

801
00:52:01,659 --> 00:52:05,652
- What'd you do?
- Well, I shopped and had lunch
and went to the pictures.

802
00:52:06,130 --> 00:52:08,666
- All by yourself?
- Yes.

803
00:52:08,666 --> 00:52:10,869
Uh, no, not exactly.

804
00:52:10,869 --> 00:52:13,271
What do you mean,
"not exactly"?

805
00:52:13,271 --> 00:52:17,264
Well, I went to the pictures by myself,
but I had lunch with Mary Norton.

806
00:52:17,509 --> 00:52:20,111
She couldn't come to the pictures
'cause she had to see her in-laws.

807
00:52:20,111 --> 00:52:22,514
They live just outside
Milford, you know?

808
00:52:22,514 --> 00:52:25,049
So I walked with her to the bus
and then came home on my own.

809
00:52:25,049 --> 00:52:28,119
I haven't seen Mary Norton for ages.
How is she looking?

810
00:52:28,119 --> 00:52:30,522
Very well, really.
A little fatter, I thought.

811
00:52:30,522 --> 00:52:33,625
Hurry up with all this beautifying.
I want my dinner.

812
00:52:33,625 --> 00:52:37,618
You go on down.
I won't be five minutes.

813
00:52:57,916 --> 00:53:00,318
- [Operator] Number, please?
- Ketchworth 3-7, please.

814
00:53:00,318 --> 00:53:04,311
Ketchworth 3-7.

815
00:53:09,260 --> 00:53:11,663
- [Man] Hello?
- Hello, is Mrs. Norton there, please?

816
00:53:11,663 --> 00:53:15,656
- Yes. Will you hold on?
- Yes, I'll hold on.

817
00:53:16,834 --> 00:53:19,003
- Hello?
- Hello? Is that you, Mary?

818
00:53:19,003 --> 00:53:22,740
Oh, Laura! Fancy hearing from you.
I thought you were dead.

819
00:53:22,740 --> 00:53:25,643
[Chuckling]
No, I haven't seen you for ages.

820
00:53:25,643 --> 00:53:27,779
Listen, my dear,

821
00:53:27,779 --> 00:53:31,082
will you be a saint and back me up
in the most appalling domestic lie?

822
00:53:31,082 --> 00:53:34,352
- As bad as all that?
- My life depends on it.

823
00:53:34,352 --> 00:53:37,822
Well, today, I went into Milford,
as usual, to do my shopping.

824
00:53:37,822 --> 00:53:41,815
With the special intention
of buying a far too expensive
present for Fred's birthday.

825
00:53:42,594 --> 00:53:44,796
Well, Spink and Robson's
hadn't got what I wanted,

826
00:53:44,796 --> 00:53:48,266
which was one of those clocks
with barometers and everything in one,

827
00:53:48,266 --> 00:53:51,302
but they rang up their branch in
Broadham and said there was one there,

828
00:53:51,302 --> 00:53:53,371
so I hopped on the 1:30 train
and went to get it.

829
00:53:53,371 --> 00:53:57,364
- Go on.
- Well, this is where
the black lie comes in.

830
00:53:58,676 --> 00:54:02,146
Fred asked me if I'd had a good day,
and I said yes,

831
00:54:02,146 --> 00:54:05,049
and that you and I had lunch and
that you had gone to see your in-laws...

832
00:54:05,049 --> 00:54:07,051
and I had gone
to the pictures.

833
00:54:07,051 --> 00:54:11,044
- If you run into him,
don't let me down, will you?
- Darling, of course not.

834
00:54:11,689 --> 00:54:15,226
- I'll do as much for you, I promise.
- Let's really lunch one day.

835
00:54:15,226 --> 00:54:18,229
- Yes, that'd be lovely.
- What about next Thursday?

836
00:54:18,229 --> 00:54:22,222
No, I can't on Thursday. That's
my Milford day. What about Friday?

837
00:54:22,433 --> 00:54:26,426
- Fine, better make it here.
- All right, perfect.

838
00:54:26,671 --> 00:54:29,340
You know what my cook's like.
It'll have to be early.

839
00:54:29,340 --> 00:54:31,876
Yes, all right.

840
00:54:31,876 --> 00:54:35,869
- Good-bye.
- Good-bye.

841
00:54:47,725 --> 00:54:51,396
<i>[Laura's Voice]</i>
<i>That week was misery.</i>

842
00:54:51,396 --> 00:54:55,389
<i>I went through it</i>
<i>in a sort of trance.</i>

843
00:54:56,167 --> 00:55:00,160
<i>How odd of you not to have</i>
<i>noticed that you were living</i>
<i>with a stranger in the house.</i>

844
00:55:02,340 --> 00:55:05,076
<i>Thursday came at last.</i>

845
00:55:05,076 --> 00:55:09,069
<i>I had arranged to meet Alec</i>
<i>outside the hospital at 12:30.</i>

846
00:55:15,386 --> 00:55:17,822
- Hello.
- Hello.

847
00:55:17,822 --> 00:55:21,815
I thought you wouldn't come.
I've been thinking all week
that you wouldn't come.

848
00:55:22,226 --> 00:55:26,219
I didn't mean to really,
but here I am.

849
00:55:31,035 --> 00:55:34,505
<i>I hadn't been inside the Royal</i>
<i>since Violet's wedding reception.</i>

850
00:55:34,505 --> 00:55:36,507
<i>It all seemed very grand.</i>

851
00:55:36,507 --> 00:55:38,810
<i>He actually ordered</i>
<i>a bottle of champagne,</i>

852
00:55:38,810 --> 00:55:41,813
<i>and when I protested, he said</i>
<i>that we were only middle-aged once.</i>

853
00:55:41,813 --> 00:55:45,049
<i>We were very gay during lunch and</i>
<i>talked about quite ordinary things.</i>

854
00:55:45,049 --> 00:55:49,042
<i>Fred, he really was charming.</i>
<i>I know you would have liked him</i>
<i>if things had been different.</i>

855
00:55:50,054 --> 00:55:52,523
<i>As we were going out he said</i>
<i>that he had a surprise for me...</i>

856
00:55:52,523 --> 00:55:56,094
<i>and that if I would wait</i>
<i>in the lounge for five minutes,</i>
<i>he'd show me what it was.</i>

857
00:55:56,094 --> 00:55:58,196
<i>He went out</i>
<i>and down the steps at a run,</i>

858
00:55:58,196 --> 00:56:02,189
<i>more like an excited schoolboy</i>
<i>than a respectable doctor.</i>

859
00:56:02,333 --> 00:56:06,326
<i>Suddenly out of the dining room</i>
<i>came Mary Norton and that rich</i>
<i>over-made-up cousin of hers.</i>

860
00:56:06,871 --> 00:56:09,140
<i>They must have been</i>
<i>in the dining room all the time...</i>

861
00:56:09,140 --> 00:56:12,777
<i>and seen Alec and me</i>
<i>and the champagne and everything.</i>

862
00:56:12,777 --> 00:56:16,280
Laura! So it was you after all.
Hermione said it was.

863
00:56:16,280 --> 00:56:18,382
- How are you?
- You know how shortsighted I am.

864
00:56:18,382 --> 00:56:20,384
I peered and peered
and still couldn't be sure.

865
00:56:20,384 --> 00:56:23,788
I never saw you at all. How awful of me.
I expect it was the champagne.

866
00:56:23,788 --> 00:56:27,781
I'm not used to champagne for lunch
or for dinner either, but Alec insisted.

867
00:56:28,226 --> 00:56:30,528
Alec? Alec who, dear?

868
00:56:30,528 --> 00:56:34,298
Alec Harvey, of course.
Surely you remember the Harveys.
I've known them for years.

869
00:56:34,298 --> 00:56:36,768
- No, I don't think I ever...
- He'll be back in a minute.

870
00:56:36,768 --> 00:56:39,137
You'll probably recognize him
when you peer very closely.

871
00:56:39,137 --> 00:56:41,806
He looks very charming
and very attentive.

872
00:56:41,806 --> 00:56:45,799
He's a dear. One of the nicest people
in the world and a wonderful doctor.

873
00:56:48,179 --> 00:56:52,183
- Oh, Alec, you remember
Mrs. Norton, don't you?
- I'm afraid I don't.

874
00:56:52,183 --> 00:56:56,176
It's no use, Laura.
We've never seen each other
before in our lives, I'm sure.

875
00:56:56,487 --> 00:56:59,457
How absurd. I made certain
he and Madeleine were there
when you dined with us...

876
00:56:59,457 --> 00:57:01,459
just before Christmas
last year.

877
00:57:01,459 --> 00:57:03,995
- Alec, this is Mrs. Rolandson.
- How do you do?

878
00:57:03,995 --> 00:57:05,997
- Horrid weather, isn't it?
- Yes.

879
00:57:05,997 --> 00:57:08,900
Of course, one can't really
expect spring at this time
of the year, can one?

880
00:57:08,900 --> 00:57:12,236
- No.
- [Chuckling Nervously]

881
00:57:12,236 --> 00:57:16,229
Well, we must be going.
I'm taking Hermione with me
to the in-laws as moral support.

882
00:57:17,341 --> 00:57:19,911
- Good-bye, Dr. Harvey.
Good-bye, my dear.
- Good-bye.

883
00:57:19,911 --> 00:57:23,815
- I do so envy you your champagne.
- Good-bye.

884
00:57:23,815 --> 00:57:27,808
Good-bye.

885
00:57:30,021 --> 00:57:32,423
- That was awful.
- Never mind.

886
00:57:32,423 --> 00:57:34,926
They had been watching us
all through lunch. Oh, dear.

887
00:57:34,926 --> 00:57:38,462
Forget it. Come out
and look at the surprise.

888
00:57:38,462 --> 00:57:42,066
<i>There at the foot of the steps</i>
<i>was a little two-seater car.</i>

889
00:57:42,066 --> 00:57:45,436
<i>Alec had borrowed it</i>
<i>from Stephen Lynn for the afternoon.</i>

890
00:57:45,436 --> 00:57:48,539
<i>I tried so hard to look pleased,</i>
<i>but it wasn't any good.</i>

891
00:57:48,539 --> 00:57:52,532
<i>I kept thinking of those two</i>
<i>laughing and talking,</i>

892
00:57:52,944 --> 00:57:56,937
<i>laughing and talking about us,</i>
<i>and I couldn't get them out of my mind.</i>

893
00:57:57,381 --> 00:58:01,374
<i>When we were out in the real country...</i>
<i>a few miles beyond Brayfield...</i>

894
00:58:01,619 --> 00:58:04,388
<i>we stopped the carjust outside</i>
<i>a village and got out.</i>

895
00:58:04,388 --> 00:58:07,291
<i>There was a little bridge</i>
<i>and a stream,</i>

896
00:58:07,291 --> 00:58:11,284
<i>and the sun was making an effort</i>
<i>to come out, but really</i>
<i>not succeeding very well.</i>

897
00:58:11,329 --> 00:58:15,299
<i>We leaned on the parapet of the bridge</i>
<i>and looked down into the water.</i>

898
00:58:15,299 --> 00:58:17,869
<i>I shivered,</i>
<i>and Alec put his arm round me.</i>

899
00:58:17,869 --> 00:58:20,504
- Cold?
- No, not really.

900
00:58:20,504 --> 00:58:24,497
Happy?

901
00:58:25,042 --> 00:58:28,079
No, not really.

902
00:58:28,079 --> 00:58:31,148
I know exactly what
you're going to say.

903
00:58:31,148 --> 00:58:34,051
That it isn't worth it.

904
00:58:34,051 --> 00:58:38,044
That the furtiveness and lying outweigh
the happiness we might have together.

905
00:58:39,190 --> 00:58:41,425
Isn't that it?

906
00:58:41,425 --> 00:58:45,418
Something like that.

907
00:58:46,931 --> 00:58:50,268
I want to ask you something,
just to reassure myself.

908
00:58:50,268 --> 00:58:52,937
What is it?

909
00:58:52,937 --> 00:58:56,930
It is true for you, isn't it?
This overwhelming feeling
we have for each other...

910
00:58:57,308 --> 00:59:01,012
it's as true for you
as it is for me, isn't it?

911
00:59:01,012 --> 00:59:05,005
Yes, it's true.

912
00:59:09,353 --> 00:59:12,623
<i>We must have stayed</i>
<i>on that bridge for a long time,</i>

913
00:59:12,623 --> 00:59:16,616
<i>because when we got back to Stephen</i>
<i>Lynn's garage, it was getting dark.</i>

914
00:59:18,229 --> 00:59:21,065
<i>I remember feeling as if</i>
<i>I was on the edge of a precipice.</i>

915
00:59:21,065 --> 00:59:23,567
<i>I think Alec felt that too.</i>

916
00:59:23,567 --> 00:59:27,560
<i>You see, we both knew</i>
<i>how desperately we loved each other.</i>

917
00:59:29,607 --> 00:59:32,677
<i>Alec said he had to leave the keys</i>
<i>of the car in Stephen Lynn's flat...</i>

918
00:59:32,677 --> 00:59:35,046
<i>and suggested</i>
<i>that I came up with him.</i>

919
00:59:35,046 --> 00:59:37,381
<i>I refused rather too vehemently.</i>

920
00:59:37,381 --> 00:59:41,374
<i>Alec reminded me that Stephen</i>
<i>wasn't coming back till late,</i>
<i>but I still refused.</i>

921
00:59:50,294 --> 00:59:54,287
I'm going back.
I'm going to miss my train.

922
00:59:54,999 --> 00:59:57,234
- Back where?
- To Stephen's flat.

923
00:59:57,234 --> 00:59:59,437
- <i>Train Whistle Blowing]</i>
- Oh, Alec.

925
01:00:14,051 --> 01:00:18,044
Alec, I must go home now.
I really must go home.

926
01:00:39,110 --> 01:00:43,103
A cup of tea, please.

927
01:00:50,154 --> 01:00:52,757
- Good afternoon.
- Afternoon, lady.
- Afternoon.

928
01:00:52,757 --> 01:00:55,459
- Couple of whiskeys, please.
- Very sorry. It's out of hours.

929
01:00:55,459 --> 01:00:58,696
Well, just sneak 'em to us under
the cover of them poor old sandwiches.

930
01:00:58,696 --> 01:01:01,599
Them sandwiches were fresh this morning,
and I shall do no such thing.

931
01:01:01,599 --> 01:01:05,569
- Come on, be a sport.
- You can have as much
as you want after 6:00.

932
01:01:05,569 --> 01:01:09,507
My throat's like a parrot's cage.
Listen. [Rasping]

933
01:01:09,507 --> 01:01:13,044
I'm sorry. My license does not
permit me to serve alcohol out of hours.

934
01:01:13,044 --> 01:01:15,846
That's final. You wouldn't want
to get me into trouble, would you?

935
01:01:15,846 --> 01:01:19,450
Just give us the chance, lady. That's
all we ask. Just give us the chance.

[Both Laughing]

937
01:01:22,420 --> 01:01:25,456
- Beryl!
- Yes, Mrs. Bagot?

938
01:01:25,456 --> 01:01:28,692
- Ask Mr. Godby to come here
a moment, will you?
- Yes, Mrs. Bagot.

939
01:01:28,692 --> 01:01:31,262
- Oh, and who's he when he's at home?
- You'll soon see.

940
01:01:31,262 --> 01:01:33,864
- Coming in here cheeking me.
- <i>Come off it, Mother. Be a pal.</i>

941
01:01:33,864 --> 01:01:37,802
- I'll give you "Mother,"
you saucy upstart.
- Oi, who you callin' an upstart?

942
01:01:37,802 --> 01:01:40,438
You! And I'll trouble you
to get out of here double quick.

943
01:01:40,438 --> 01:01:42,873
Disturbing the customers and
making a nuisance of yourselves.

944
01:01:42,873 --> 01:01:45,609
Here, where's the fire,
where's the fire?

945
01:01:45,609 --> 01:01:48,846
- What's going on in here?
- Mr. Godby,
these gentlemen are annoying me.

946
01:01:48,846 --> 01:01:52,839
- What? We haven't done nothing,
have we, Johnnie?
- All we did was ask for drinks.

947
01:01:53,184 --> 01:01:57,121
- They insulted me, Mr. Godby.
- <i>We never did anything of the kind.</i>

948
01:01:57,121 --> 01:01:59,390
- Just having a little joke, that's all.
- Hop it, both of you.

949
01:01:59,390 --> 01:02:02,793
- We've got a right to stay here
as long as we like.
- You heard what I said. Hop it.

950
01:02:02,793 --> 01:02:05,463
Now, look here. What is this, a free
country or a bloomin' Sunday school?

951
01:02:05,463 --> 01:02:09,166
<i>I checked your warrants at the gate.</i>
<i>Your train's due in one minute. Hop it.</i>

952
01:02:09,166 --> 01:02:11,902
- Now, look here...
- Aw, come on, Johnnie. Come on.

953
01:02:11,902 --> 01:02:15,895
- Don't argue with the poor basket.
- Hop it.

954
01:02:19,443 --> 01:02:23,114
<i>Cheerio, Mother.</i>

955
01:02:23,114 --> 01:02:27,107
And if them sandwiches were made
this morning, you're Shirley Temple.

956
01:02:28,786 --> 01:02:32,189
- Thank you, Albert.
- What a nerve... talking to you
like that, Mrs. Bagot.

957
01:02:32,189 --> 01:02:36,182
Be quiet, Beryl. Pour me out a nip
of Three Star. I'm feeling quite upset.

958
01:02:36,293 --> 01:02:40,297
- I have to get back to the gate.
- I'll be seeing you later, Albert.

959
01:02:40,297 --> 01:02:43,300
Okay.

Excuse me.

969
01:04:41,452 --> 01:04:45,445
Darling.

970
01:04:50,060 --> 01:04:52,796
It's raining.

971
01:04:52,796 --> 01:04:55,299
It started just as I turned out
of the High Street.

972
01:04:55,299 --> 01:04:57,935
You had no umbrella,
and your coat's wet.

973
01:04:57,935 --> 01:05:01,928
You mustn't catch cold.
That would never do.

974
01:05:04,675 --> 01:05:08,078
- I look an absolute fright.
- Let me put that down for you.

975
01:05:08,078 --> 01:05:12,071
Thank you.

976
01:05:12,283 --> 01:05:15,753
I hope the fire will
perk up in a few minutes.

977
01:05:15,753 --> 01:05:19,746
- I expect the wood was damp.
- Yes, I expect it was.

978
01:05:22,326 --> 01:05:26,319
Do sit down, darling.

979
01:05:30,434 --> 01:05:33,771
I got right into the train and then
got out again. Wasn't it idiotic?

980
01:05:33,771 --> 01:05:37,764
We're both very,
very foolish.

981
01:05:41,712 --> 01:05:45,049
- Alec, I can't stay, you know.
Really, I can't.
- Just a little while.

982
01:05:45,049 --> 01:05:48,652
- Just a little while.
- <i>[Door Opening]</i>

Quickly, quickly!
I must go.

984

- <i>[Door Closing]</i>
- Here, through the kitchen.
There's a tradesman's staircase.

01:06:04,535 --> 01:06:08,528
- <i>[Stephen] Is that you, Alec?</i>
- Yes.

986
01:06:11,141 --> 01:06:13,544
- You're back early.
- Yes, I felt a cold coming on,

987
01:06:13,544 --> 01:06:15,979
so I denied myself
the questionable pleasure of dining...

988
01:06:15,979 --> 01:06:19,583
with that arch-arguer Roger Hinchley
and decided to come back to bed.

989

- Inflamed membranes are
unsympathetic to a dialectic.
- What'll you do about food?

990
01:06:24,521 --> 01:06:27,491
I can always ring down to the restaurant
if I want any later on.

991
01:06:27,491 --> 01:06:31,484
- We live in a modern age,
and this <i>is</i> a service flat.
- Yes, yes, of course.

992
01:06:31,795 --> 01:06:35,788
It caters for all tastes.

993
01:06:39,737 --> 01:06:43,407
You know, my dear Alec, you have hidden
depths which I never even suspected.

994
01:06:43,407 --> 01:06:46,810
- <i>Look here, Stephen...</i>
- Oh, for heaven's sake, Alec.
No explanations or apologies.

995
01:06:46,810 --> 01:06:50,547
I am the one who should apologize
for returning so inopportunely.

996
01:06:50,547 --> 01:06:53,884
It's quite obvious to me that you were
interviewing a patient privately.

997
01:06:53,884 --> 01:06:56,653
<i>Women are frequently</i>
<i>rather neurotic creatures,</i>

998
01:06:56,653 --> 01:06:58,922
<i>and the hospital atmosphere</i>
<i>is upsetting to them.</i>

999
01:06:58,922 --> 01:07:02,915
By the rather undignified scuffling
which I heard when I came into the hall,

1000
01:07:03,427 --> 01:07:06,463
I gather that she beat
a hasty retreat down the back stairs.

1001
01:07:06,463 --> 01:07:10,167
I'm surprised at this farcical streak
in your nature, Alec.

1002
01:07:10,167 --> 01:07:13,704
Such carryings-on are quite unnecessary.
After all, we've been friends for years,

1003
01:07:13,704 --> 01:07:16,740
and I am the most
broad-minded of men.

1004
01:07:16,740 --> 01:07:19,176
I'm really very sorry,
Stephen.

1005
01:07:19,176 --> 01:07:23,180
I'm sure that the whole situation
must seem inexpressibly vulgar to you.

1006
01:07:23,180 --> 01:07:25,416
Actually,
it isn't in the least.

1007
01:07:25,416 --> 01:07:29,409
However, you're perfectly right:
Explanations are unnecessary,
particularly between friends.

1008
01:07:29,620 --> 01:07:31,989
- I must go now.
I'll collect my hat and coat.
- Very well.

1009
01:07:31,989 --> 01:07:34,191
- Good-bye.
- Perhaps you'll let me
have my latchkey back.

1010
01:07:34,191 --> 01:07:38,184
I only have two,
and I'm so afraid of losing them.
You know how absentminded I am.

1011
01:07:40,631 --> 01:07:44,624
- You're very angry, aren't you?
- No, Alec, not angry, just disappointed.

1012
01:08:10,194 --> 01:08:14,187
<i>I ran until I couldn't run any longer.</i>
<i>I leant against a lamppost</i>
<i>to get my breath.</i>

1013
01:08:14,932 --> 01:08:17,668
<i>I was in one of those side roads</i>
<i>that lead out of the High Street.</i>

1014
01:08:17,668 --> 01:08:21,661
<i>I know it was stupid to run,</i>
<i>but I couldn't help myself.</i>

1015
01:08:21,772 --> 01:08:25,765
<i>I felt so utterly humiliated</i>
<i>and defeated and so dreadfully,</i>
<i>dreadfully ashamed.</i>

1016
01:08:28,879 --> 01:08:32,683
<i>After a moment or two</i>
<i>I pulled myself together...</i>

1017
01:08:32,683 --> 01:08:35,519
<i>and walked on</i>
<i>in the direction of the station.</i>

1018
01:08:35,519 --> 01:08:38,155
<i>It was still raining,</i>
<i>but not very much.</i>

1019
01:08:38,155 --> 01:08:40,691
<i>I suddenly realized</i>
<i>that I couldn't go home,</i>

1020
01:08:40,691 --> 01:08:44,194
<i>not until I had got myself more under</i>
<i>control and had a little time to think.</i>

1021
01:08:44,194 --> 01:08:46,930
<i>Then I thought of you waiting at home</i>
<i>and the dinner being spoilt,</i>

1022
01:08:46,930 --> 01:08:50,923
<i>so I went into the High Street and found</i>
<i>a tobacconist and telephoned to you.</i>

1023
01:08:51,969 --> 01:08:55,962
<i>Do you remember?</i>

1024
01:09:17,861 --> 01:09:19,997
Hello, Fred, is that you?

1025
01:09:19,997 --> 01:09:22,766
Yes, dear, it's me, Laura.

1026
01:09:22,766 --> 01:09:26,637
Yes, everything's perfectly all right,
but I shan't be home to dinner.

1027
01:09:26,637 --> 01:09:28,672
I'm with Miss Lewis.

1028
01:09:28,672 --> 01:09:32,643
Miss Lewis, dear. You know,
the librarian I told you about at Boots.

1029
01:09:32,643 --> 01:09:36,636
Y-Yes, I can't explain in any detail
because she's outside the box now.

1030
01:09:36,947 --> 01:09:40,940
I met her in the High Street a little
while ago in a terrible state.

1031
01:09:41,051 --> 01:09:45,044
Her mother's been taken ill,
and I've promised to stay
with her until the doctor comes.

1032
01:09:46,023 --> 01:09:50,016
Yes, I know, but she's always
been awfully kind to me,
and I feel so sorry for her.

1033
01:09:51,261 --> 01:09:55,254
No, I'll get a sandwich, but
ask Ethel to leave me some soup
in a saucepan in the kitchen.

1034
01:09:57,634 --> 01:10:00,904
Yes, of course,
as soon as I can.

1035
01:10:00,904 --> 01:10:03,974
All right. Good-bye.

1036
01:10:03,974 --> 01:10:07,978
<i>It's awfully easy to lie when you know</i>
<i>that you're trusted implicitly...</i>

1037
01:10:07,978 --> 01:10:11,971
<i>so very easy</i>
<i>and so very degrading.</i>

1038
01:10:12,015 --> 01:10:14,351
<i>I started walking</i>
<i>without much purpose.</i>

1039
01:10:14,351 --> 01:10:17,387
<i>I turned out of the High Street</i>
<i>almost immediately.</i>

1040
01:10:17,387 --> 01:10:20,357
<i>I was terrified</i>
<i>that I might run into Alec.</i>

1041
01:10:20,357 --> 01:10:24,350
<i>I was pretty certain that he'd</i>
<i>come after me to the station.</i>

1042
01:10:24,394 --> 01:10:28,365
<i>I walked for a long while. Finally,</i>
<i>I found myself at the war memorial...</i>

1043
01:10:28,365 --> 01:10:31,168
<i>you know, it's right</i>
<i>at the other side of the town.</i>

1044
01:10:31,168 --> 01:10:34,905
<i>It had stopped raining altogether,</i>
<i>and I felt stiflingly hot,</i>

1045
01:10:34,905 --> 01:10:38,041
<i>so I sat down</i>
<i>on one of the seats.</i>

1046
01:10:38,041 --> 01:10:40,143
<i>There was nobody about,</i>
<i>and I lit a cigarette.</i>

1047
01:10:40,143 --> 01:10:44,014
<i>I know how you disapprove</i>
<i>of women smoking in the street...</i>
<i>I do too, really...</i>

1048
01:10:44,014 --> 01:10:48,007
<i>but I wanted to calm my nerves,</i>
<i>and I thought it might help.</i>

1049
01:10:48,919 --> 01:10:52,912
<i>I sat there for ages...</i>
<i>I don't know how long...</i>

1050
01:10:53,190 --> 01:10:57,060
<i>then I noticed a policeman</i>
<i>walking up and down a little way off.</i>

1051
01:10:57,060 --> 01:11:00,731
<i>He was looking at me</i>
<i>rather suspiciously.</i>

1052
01:11:00,731 --> 01:11:03,100
<i>Presently he came up to me.</i>

1053
01:11:03,100 --> 01:11:05,769
Feeling all right, miss?

1054
01:11:05,769 --> 01:11:08,972
- Yes, thank you.
- Waiting for someone?

1055
01:11:08,972 --> 01:11:11,341
No. No, I'm not
waiting for anybody.

1056
01:11:11,341 --> 01:11:15,334
Don't go and catch cold now. It's a damp
night for sitting about on seats.

1057
01:11:15,445 --> 01:11:17,848
I'm going now anyhow.
I've got to catch a train.

1058
01:11:17,848 --> 01:11:20,183
You're sure you feel

Oh, and have you got

- Well, the book stall's closed.

- We didn't speak of you.

- We spoke of some nameless

- Why didn't you tell him?

We know we love each other.
That's all that matters.

It isn't all that matters.
Other things matter too.

Self-respect matters, and decency.
I can't go on any longer.

I know about the strain of our different

1103

The feeling of guilt, doing wrong
is too strong, isn't it?

1104
01:14:47,123 --> 01:14:51,116
Too great a price to pay
for the happiness we have together.

Let's be very careful.
Let's prepare ourselves.

01:15:11,248 --> 01:15:15,252
A sudden break now, however brave
and admirable, would be too cruel.

I'll take Madeleine and the boys.

<i>arriving at platform four...</i>

1209
01:22:16,906 --> 01:22:20,899
<i>is the 5:40 for Churley,</i>
<i>Leigh Green and Langdon.</i>

1210
01:22:21,577 --> 01:22:23,646
- I must go. Good-bye.
- Yes, you must.

1211
01:22:23,646 --> 01:22:27,639
Good-bye.

1212
01:22:29,585 --> 01:22:33,523
<i>I felt the touch of his hand</i>
<i>on my shoulder for a moment,</i>

1213
01:22:33,523 --> 01:22:36,726
<i>and then he walked away...</i>

1214
01:22:36,726 --> 01:22:38,961
<i>away,</i>
<i>out of my life forever.</i>

1215
01:22:38,961 --> 01:22:41,864
[Laughs] He's got to get
right over to the other platform.

1216
01:22:41,864 --> 01:22:45,468
Talking of missing trains reminds me of
that awful bridge at Broadham Junction.

1217
01:22:45,468 --> 01:22:49,461
<i>Dolly still went on talking,</i>
<i>but I wasn't listening to her.</i>

1218
01:22:49,739 --> 01:22:53,732
- <i>I was listening for the sound</i>
<i>of his train starting.</i>
- <i>[Whistle Blows]</i>

1219
01:22:54,610 --> 01:22:58,081
- <i>Then it did.</i>
- <i>[Train Engine Chugging]</i>

1220
01:22:58,081 --> 01:23:00,783
<i>I said to myself,</i>
<i>"He didn't go.</i>

1221
01:23:00,783 --> 01:23:04,387
<i>"At the last minute his courage</i>
<i>failed him. He couldn't have gone.</i>

1222
01:23:04,387 --> 01:23:08,380
<i>Any minute he'll come back into</i>
<i>the refreshment room pretending</i>
<i>he's forgotten something. "</i>

1223
01:23:08,458 --> 01:23:10,660
<i>I prayed for him to do that,</i>

1224
01:23:10,660 --> 01:23:14,653
<i>just so that I could</i>
<i>see him again for an instant.</i>

1225
01:23:16,733 --> 01:23:20,169
- <i>But the minutes went by.</i>
- <i>[Bell Ringing]</i>

1226
01:23:20,169 --> 01:23:24,173
Is that the train? Oh, can you tell me,
is that the Ketchworth train?

1227
01:23:24,173 --> 01:23:26,509
- <i>[Woman] No, it's the express.</i>
- The boat train.

1228
01:23:26,509 --> 01:23:28,478
That doesn't stop,
does it?

1229
01:23:28,478 --> 01:23:28,611
That doesn't stop,
does it?

1230
01:23:28,611 --> 01:23:32,048
- <i>I want some chocolate, please.</i>
- <i>Milk or plain?</i>

1231
01:23:32,048 --> 01:23:36,041
<i>[Train Whistle Blowing]</i>

1232
01:24:00,910 --> 01:24:04,903
<i>I meant to do it, Fred.</i>
<i>I really meant to do it.</i>

1233
01:24:04,947 --> 01:24:08,940
<i>I stood there trembling</i>
<i>right on the edge,</i>

1234
01:24:09,485 --> 01:24:11,821
<i>but I couldn't.</i>

1235
01:24:11,821 --> 01:24:14,991
<i>I wasn't brave enough.</i>

1236
01:24:14,991 --> 01:24:18,161
<i>I'd like to say it was the thought of</i>
<i>you and the children that prevented me,</i>

1237
01:24:18,161 --> 01:24:21,197
<i>but it wasn't.</i>

1238
01:24:21,197 --> 01:24:24,667
<i>I had no thoughts at all,</i>

1239
01:24:24,667 --> 01:24:28,660
<i>only an overwhelming desire</i>
<i>not to feel anything ever again,</i>

1240
01:24:29,705 --> 01:24:32,008
<i>not to be unhappy anymore.</i>

1241
01:24:32,008 --> 01:24:35,611
<i>I turned...</i>

1242
01:24:35,611 --> 01:24:39,604
<i>and went back</i>
<i>into the refreshment room.</i>

1243
01:24:44,754 --> 01:24:48,747
<i>That's when I nearly fainted.</i>

1244
01:25:26,963 --> 01:25:30,800
Laura.

1245
01:25:30,800 --> 01:25:32,802
Yes, dear?

1246
01:25:32,802 --> 01:25:36,795
Whatever your dream was,
it wasn't a very happy one, was it?

1247
01:25:40,009 --> 01:25:42,011
No.

1248
01:25:42,011 --> 01:25:46,004
Is there anything
I can do to help?

1249
01:25:47,149 --> 01:25:49,652
Yes, Fred.
You always help.

1250
01:25:49,652 --> 01:25:53,656
You've been
a long way away.

1251
01:25:53,656 --> 01:25:55,658
Yes.

1252
01:25:55,658 --> 01:25:59,651
Thank you for coming
back to me.

1253
01:26:00,863 --> 01:26:04,856
