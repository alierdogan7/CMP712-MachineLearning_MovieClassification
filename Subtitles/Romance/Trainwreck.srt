1
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:31,289
Girls, your mother and
I are getting divorced.

2
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:35,009
Don't cry. I know you're
upset, I know you're confused.

3
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:36,844
I don't know what
your mother told you,

4
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:38,524
but let me explain it
from my side,

5
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:41,007
in terms you can understand.

6
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:45,720
You got your
doll, right?

7
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:46,767
You got your
doll there.

8
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:47,807
Yeah.

9
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:49,968
You got your doll, you like
your doll, right? Yes.

10
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:51,565
You love your doll. Yeah.

11
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:53,244
Yes, you love the doll.

12
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:55,561
But what if
I told you

13
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:57,210
that was the only doll
you're allowed to play with

14
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:58,770
the rest of your life?

15
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:00,811
How would you feel?

16
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:02,601
Sad.

17
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:04,364
You'd feel sad!
Of course!

18
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:06,204
Because there's a lot of
other dolls on your shelves.

19
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:07,566
And if you play
with the other dolls,

20
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:09,005
you can't have
that doll anymore.

21
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:10,241
Even though that
doll doesn't really

22
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:11,845
want to play with
you at this point.

23
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,002
You're both
living a lie!

24
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:15,929
There's other
dolls you like,

25
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,729
and they're making
new dolls every year.

26
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:18,926
You want a
stewardess doll?

27
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,081
BOTH: Yeah.

28
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:22,083
What about a slightly overweight
cocktail waitress doll?

29
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:23,127
BOTH: Yeah.

30
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,611
What about a doll
who happens to be

31
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:26,091
best friends
with your main doll'?

32
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:27,161
BOTH: Yeah.

33
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:28,890
It could happen, right?
BOTH: Yeah.

34
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,765
What about a doll you only play
with one day and never see again?

35
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:33,001
BOTH: (EMPHATICALLY) Yeah!

36
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:35,287
What about a doll where your
friend's playing with the doll,

37
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:39,046
and he needs you to kind of
man up with the other doll.

38
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:40,286
You don't even want
to play with that doll,

39
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:42,203
but you do it because your
friend's playing with that doll.

40
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:44,442
You don't wanna sit there and
leave the other doll unattended.

41
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:45,567
BOTH: Yeah.

42
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:48,520
So that's why me and Mom
are getting divorced.

43
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:51,371
Monogamy isn't realistic!

44
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:54,171
BOTH: Monogamy
isn't realistic!

45
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:55,521
Again!

46
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:57,841
BOTH: Monogamy
isn't realistic.

47
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:58,921
Again!

48
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:02,446
(KISSING)

49
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:03,806
(MOANING)

50
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:07,726
AMY: I never do this.
This is so weird for me.

51
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:11,005
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

52
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,767
I really like
these ones.

53
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:18,330
Oh, no!

54
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:22,488
Shit! That's your dick? Uh-huh!

55
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:25,882
Too big! Your dick
doesn't end.

56
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:29,007
Why doesn't your dick end?
(CHUCKLES)

57
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:31,447
Have you ever
fucked someone before?

58
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:32,885
Where is she buried?

59
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:36,571
That looks like the whole
cast of Game of Thrones.

60
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:38,880
Come here.

61
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,240
You know what?

62
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:46,921
I'm, like, really shy, Uh-huh.

63
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,843
So we should probably
do this first

64
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:50,809
so I feel
comfortable with you.

65
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:52,445
Yeah, all right.

66
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:56,365
A little warm-up. I know.
Yeah, a little warm-up.

67
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:57,441
You taste
like mango.

68
00:02:57,520 --> 00:03:00,000
Just stop talking, okay?
Just, like...

69
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,688
Just do the alphabet.

70
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:03,887
Just hang up
at the top.

71
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:06,008
Everything important
is up at the top.

72
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:07,281
Yeah, that's good.

73
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:08,921
Okay.

74
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:11,805
(INHALING SHARPLY)

75
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:15,960

MAN: Hey,
you like that, right'?

78
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:23,647
(WHISPERS) Amy?

79
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:25,521
Hey.

80
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:27,771
I think it's
my turn, baby.

81
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,724
Amy, seriously,
my turn.

82
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:34,400
Muffin, remember you
said you were gonna...

83
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,448
(CONTINUES SNORING)

84
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:39,846
MAN: Okay.

85
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:49,804
<i>AMY: Hey, guys, I'm Amy.
Don't judge me, fuckers!</i>

87
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:54,804
<i>I am fine. S am in control.</i>

88
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:58,323
<i>This is clearly
not my first rodeo.</i>

89
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:01,768
<i>The key is to never
ever let them sleep over.</i>

90
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:04,924
I got a couple of ticks
to The Black Keys,

91
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,081
Thursday, if you want... Ooh...

92
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:08,447
Thanks. Bye!

93
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:10,844
AMY: All right, good night.

94
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,251
All right, bye.
Good night.

95
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:14,321
Oh...

96
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:17,649
I guess I do love pussy.
(CHUCKLES)

97
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:23,921
AMY: <i>Look, (have a great job

<i>This dude is not him.</i>

101
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:35,488
<i>This guy is who
I'm seeing. Kind of.</i>

102
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:37,369
<i>He's hot, right?</i>

103
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:41,002
<i>He is great, but it is like
fucking an ice sculpture.</i>

104

109
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:56,047
There she is.
Buenos <i>dias,</i> baby.

110
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,844
0h, my God!

111
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:59,365
You look like
an angel.

112
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:00,680
What time is it?

113
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:02,603
MAN: It's like 7:30
in the morning.

114
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,484
I didn't know if I should
let you sleep or not.

115
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:05,721
Or make you breakfast.

116
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:06,961
I chose breakfast.

117
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,246

00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:10,569
Oh, you're in
Staten Island, sugar!

What?

Help me out, dude. Come on.

123
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:07,449
Noam, watch out.
Good morning.

124
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:08,760
On! Amy!

125
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:10,285
There she is,
my princess.

126
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:12,124
What happened? Did
church let out early?

127
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,725
Ha-ha.
(CHUCKLES)

128
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:15,564
NOAM: Hey! Amy,
where are you going?

129
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:17,290
This isn't
Planned Parenthood.

130
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:25,769
Oh, my God.
Shut up!

131
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:27,569
You have to tell me
everything about last night.

132
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:31,087
I went on your lnstagram.
That guy is like, so hot.

133
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:33,447
He looks kind of like
a white Drake. No.

134
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:35,124
He was like
a Puerto Rican Gollum.

135
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:36,326
I'm not talking
about it.

136
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,482
AMY: Do you have to pee?
Yeah, totally.

137
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:40,165
(TINKLING)

138
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:42,208
AMY: Did you hear Johnny Depp is
coming into the office today?

139
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:43,645
NIKKI: Oh, yeah.
I'm all overthat.

140
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:45,724
Which version
of Johnny Depp

141
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:46,921
would you most
wanna have sex with?

142
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,525
Which one does it
for you the most?

143
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,090
Because I can't
stop thinking about it.

144
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,446
<i>For me, 'Ks
Pirates of the Caribbean.</i>

145
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:54,444
I love a fully
made up, long hair,

146
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:56,363
almost feminine-looking
Johnny Depp.

147
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:59,364
Not almost. He looks like a
beautiful woman in that movie.

148
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:01,209
Yeah. Who would be yours?

149
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:04,250
I'm thinking, like, an Edward
Scissorhands Johnny Depp.

150
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:05,930
You would get
totally cut up.

151
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,968
Yeah, but he'd feel
so bad about it

152
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:09,451
that he'd be like,
"I'll never leave you."

153
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:11,568
And I would get,
like, a sick haircut.

154
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:12,641
Yeah. Yeah.

155
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:15,724
But also, guess what?
Willy Wonka, bring it on.

156
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:17,290
Oh, my God, totally.
Right?

157
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,885
Yeah. I would
fuck the shit

158
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,968
out of Willy Wonka
Johnny Depp.

159
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:23,602
DIANNA: Okay, my babes,
I want your undivided.

160
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:25,850
I've been looking
at your pitches

161
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:27,046
and these are
my thoughts.

162
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:28,680
Nikki.

163
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:30,891
Why are you smiling?

164
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:33,567
I'm not smiling,
I'm just very nervous.

165
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,728
DIANNA: Stop smiling.
Stop smiling.

166
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:38,602
That's even more.
Nikki.

167
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:41,047
The more nervous I get,
the more I smile, so...

168
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,360
Stop smiling.

169
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,684
Stop it. Stop it.

170
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:48,091
Nikki, shut it down. Come on.
Bring it down, bring it down.

171
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:49,881
That's it.

172
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,969
I'm sick of your
ginger nonsense.

173
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:54,725
I don't wanna see
those gnashers. No.

174
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,331
Stop it.
What's this?

175
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,243
BRYSON: That's our
new intern, Donald.

176
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:00,322
I thought we were getting
a chick, but he's here.

177
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,402
Okay.
Welcome, Donald.

178
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:04,801
Welcome to S'nuff where we are
teaching the strong-willed man

179
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:06,763
how to dress,
think, eat, fuck.

180
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:08,564
Do you like the
magazine, Donald'?

181
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:11,087
Oh, yeah, it's pretty much all I read.
Good answer.

182
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:14,721
Look, this is ours. This is ours.
Right? We made this.

183
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,650
What's our demographic?

184
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,688
ALL: Every-fucking-one.

185
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:21,000
Thank you.
You can go now.

186
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:23,686
Yeah, thank you.
It's a big opportunity.

187
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:27,842
Right, pitch me.
Pitch me hard. Schultz?

188
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,604
So I was thinking
of something called

189
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,648
the "S'nuff Guide to
Beating Off at Work."

190
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:33,245
Where to do it,
how to do it,

191
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:34,651
how not to
get caught.

192
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:35,960
How to get caught.

193
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:37,246
SCHULTZ: Makes it more fun.

194
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:39,482
I already started
the research, you guys.

195
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:41,050
(CHUCKLING)

196
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,690
DIANNA: Bryson?
Okay, I got one.

197
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:44,762
"You're not gay.
She's boring."

198
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:45,841
DIANNA: Good.
Yeah?

199
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:47,724
Fantastic! I can see it.
Thank you.

200
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:49,564
Okay. I have
another to pitch.

201
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:51,369
Maybe a cover,
I don't know.

202
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,487
Uh...

203
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,403
"You call those tits?"

204
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:55,845
That's good. Yeah.

205
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:58,127
And then maybe like a
"Where are they now?" piece

206
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:01,044
about the kids Michael
Jackson gave settlements to.

207
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,326
DIANNA: Good.
Ooh...

208
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:03,481
I want to know.

209
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:04,561
That's good, yeah.

210
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,802
I play ice hockey with one of them.
I'll get an email.

211
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:07,961
DIANNA: Yeah, that's good.

212
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:09,485
Right. So, assignments.

213
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:12,484
Schultz, you're on
the Ryan Phillippe piece.

214
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:13,607
Oh! What?

215
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:14,681
Yes! Crash
was epic.

216
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:17,445
I was thinking I would take a
stab at the Phillippe piece.

217
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:20,171
No. Ryan, I tell you, he's
in a major funk right now,

218
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:22,049
and he will respond
much better

219
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:24,646
to a male who is neither
attractive nor masculine.

220
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,927
Blam! That's me
right here.

221
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,401
Bryson, I've got
a red mark by your name.

222
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:30,720
Why would that be?
Yes, okay.

223
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:33,491
I am pitching
Dr. Aaron Conners.

224
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:34,925
He works with
some of the Knicks.

225
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,766
He's this incredible, young
sports physician on the rise,

226
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:40,649
and he just created
this revolutionary

227
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:42,927
knee insert that cuts
recovery time in half.

228
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,082
He's about to perform it
on Amaﬂe Stoudemire.

229
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:47,447
It will be the first time it's
ever been done on a pro athlete.

230
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:49,045
If we get this,
we'll have access

231
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,565
to the biggest
names in sports.

232
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:53,166
LeBron, Durant,
Blake Griffin.

233
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:55,891
I've heard of this guy. He did
D'Brickashaw Ferguson's knee, right?

234
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:57,086
YES.

235
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,326
Yeah, and Metta
World Peace's too.

236
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:01,051
Yeah. Thabo Sefolosha owes his
whole career to this guy.

237
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:02,605
Are these
real names?

238
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:04,523
What's that, Amy?
Your thoughts?

239
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:05,726
AMY: I'm sorry, I just...

240
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:08,727
I don't know why we treat
these athletes like heroes

241
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,643
just because
they can skate fast

242
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:12,210
or kick a ball in a net.

243
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:13,850
I just think it's weird.
No offense.

244
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:16,844
I just think that
sports are stupid,

245
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:18,809
and anyone who
likes them

246
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:22,043
is just, like,
a lesser person.

247
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:24,363
And has a
small intellect.

248
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:31,170
Killer. I want you
to write the piece.

249
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:33,051
What?
What?

250
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:35,566
0h, no, I literally
can't stomach sports.

251
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:37,802
Yeah, I know. Your
opposition is perfection.

252
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:39,644
This really feels
like a Bryson article.

253
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:42,007
Yeah, this feels like a "me" article.
Ipﬂchedit

254
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:43,610
Yeah, you pitched it.
I'm giving it to Amy.

255
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:45,330
What are you saying? You
giving me some attitude here?

256
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:47,289
This isn't a fucking
medical journal.

257
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:49,169
I can do opposition,
I can do sexy.

258
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:52,005
I want that.
I want that hatred.

259
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:53,161
I'm giving it to Amy.

260
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:55,163
Don't sulk at me.
I'm not sulking.

261
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:57,129
This is my decision.
I'm giving it to Amy.

262
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,770
Sure. Fine.

263
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:02,365
BRYSON: I can do sexy though.
Sorry?

264
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:04,920
Huh? Nothing. I'm fine.
DIANNA: What?

265
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:07,524
I'm just having fun.
(CHUCKES DRYLY)

266
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:11,327
DIANNA: Nikki,
I want you to research

267
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,841
whether garlic makes semen
taste any different.

268
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:15,925
Oh... Um...

269
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:18,400
How am I supposed to get the...
DIANNA: Thank you.

270
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,209
You inspire me.

271
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:24,125
It tastes the same.

272
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,411
Am?-

273
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:30,444
I'm not trying
to punish you.

274
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:32,045
Does it feel
a little like I am'?

275
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:34,407
No, no,
I appreciate the...

276
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:36,687
I know you want to branch
out and cover more,

277
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,848
and you do know
I'm looking for a new

278
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:40,570
executive editor,
don't you'?

279
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:42,847
I do know that, and I'm
very, very interested.

280
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:44,809
Hmm. I'd love to be considered.

281
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:47,885
Especially my dad's
house isn't selling

282
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:49,610
and my sister and I
just had to put him

283
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:51,569
in this assisted
living place,

284
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:54,166
and you would think it was like
the Waldorf. It's so expensive.

285
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,890
Is this your one-woman
show right now'?

286
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:57,564
Because I ain't
got a ticket.

287
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:02,124
You know, just
eviscerate the piece.

288
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:04,408
I'm giving you an assignment.
Right, yeah.

289
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:09,771
Hmm? And, Amy, if you would
teach this about this.

290
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:16,243
So, does she have
a foreign accent

291
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:17,731
or is she just
awesome?

292
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:21,404
Don't talk to me
for two weeks.

293
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:27,528
AMY: <i>That's my sister Kim.
She's cute, right?</i>

294
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:31,326
<i>Well, back off! She's
totally married as fuck!</i>

295
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,650
<i>Our dad's MS has
gotten really bad,</i>

296
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:35,449
<i>so he can't live
by himself anymore.</i>

297
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:37,284
<i>We're cleaning out his house.</i>

298
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:39,081
KIM: There's your box.

299
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:40,924
That stuff's Goodwill,
that stuff's eBay,

300
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,445
and the stuff
up front is trash.

301
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:44,921
AMY: This stuffs eBay?
KIM: Yeah.

302
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,764
Iwanna go
through this.

303
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:47,966
No, don't go
through it.

304
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:49,883
That's stuff we can
make money off of.

305
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:52,530
Why are they here?

306
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:54,685
KIM: They're picking me up.

307
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:57,127
Hey, Mother, look,
we got a croquet set!

308
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,531
Great job, sweetpea!

309
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,929
He calls you Mother?
That's not creepy.

310
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,001
Yeah, it's
his choice.

311
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:03,451
Have him call
you Stepmother.

312
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:04,760
It's more accurate.

313
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:06,126
I've raised
that child!

314
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:07,406
Mom, lfound
a glove.

315
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:09,482
Hey, buddy, how you doing? Good.

316
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,568
What are you
studying in school'?

317
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:12,971
I'm learning
about space

318
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:15,361
and all the
celestial objects

319
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:16,606
and how there are

320
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:18,409
planets and
solar systems,

321
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:21,643
and sometimes there could
be multiple universes

322
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:23,449
but people don't know
how to describe that yet,

323
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:24,601
but it's a new theory,

324
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:27,411
and I'm so excited to see if
they figure it out or not.

325
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:29,721
Great.

326
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:32,086
See you around.

327
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:34,561
Okay.

328
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:38,490
Why is he dressed
like Colonel Sanders?

329
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:40,130
He got to dress himself
and that's what he chose.

330
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:42,561
That's what the inside of his
heart looks like. Be nice.

331
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:43,926
Can you just be
real for a second?

332
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,163
If you just met
that dude at a CVS,

333
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:48,571
you'd have a real
problem with him.

334
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,286
Can you just
pretend to like him?

335
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:51,600
I am pretending.

336
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:54,445
Ooh, I like
Tom's sweater.

337
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:57,331
He's doing the
To Catch a Predator look.

338
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:58,680
Amy!
What?

339
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:00,000
TOM: Amy, what's up?

340
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:01,923
Hey! Looking sharp.

341
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:04,488
Looking sharp, man. Thanks.

342
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:06,050
TOM: Nice to see you.
AMY: Nice to see you'

343
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:07,201
I was reading
your article about

344
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:09,282
how to talk your girlfriend
into a three-way.

345
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:10,686
You read that one? Yeah.

346
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:11,761
Wow!

347
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:12,841
Would you do that? No.

348
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:13,921
No.

349
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:15,121
That got off
the table quick.

350
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,201
Yeah.

351
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:17,281
Lei him do
what he wants.

352
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:18,361
You guys should
make a sex tape.

353
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:19,851
I would.
Uh...

354
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:21,200
I did high
school theater.

355
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:23,601
I think I'd be pretty good.
(LAUGHING)

356
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:26,288
AMY: This nursing home is nice.
KIM: Yeah.

357
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:28,523
Ifs too nice and
it's too expensive

358
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:30,682
and we should've
put him in a shithole.

359
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:32,808
We did. I mean,
it's a shithole.

360
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:35,326
It's just the nicest shithole.
Yeah.

361
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:39,446
Places where the nurses don't
fuck the patients are expensive.

362
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:40,601
That's what
you're paying for.

363
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:41,841
It's not the food,
sister.

364
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,286
Ew!

365
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:45,721
"Condoms ribbed
for his pleasure"?

366
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:46,767
(Gas PS)

367
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:47,887
I better hold on
to these.

368
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:49,689
Is this coke?

369
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,046
No. Dad didn't
love coke.

370
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:53,322
He was just a
full-blown alcoholic.

371
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:54,811
(SNORTING)
(GASPS)

372
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:57,764
No. It must just be from
a Halloween costume. Oh.

373
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:01,601
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

374
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:02,761
KIM: Moving on.
AMY: Let's just...

375
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:03,881
Amy, don't touch it.

376
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:05,246
These are
his memories.

377
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:07,766
No, don't do that!
Toss it away.

378
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:09,205
What? He needs
his wallet.

379
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:11,806
We've got so much stuff to go through.
Please stop...

380
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:15,563
Oh! He loves
that poster.

381
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:17,005
I know.

382
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:21,841
Kimberly! Stop it!
Stop it! Girl!

383
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:24,243
Come on!
Not cool, girl!

384
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:25,771
That felt good.

385
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:28,081
It's not right.

386
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:29,161
Alaska.

387
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:30,805
No. Don't throw
away his snow globes.

388
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:33,611
These are his memories. He got
one of these everywhere he went.

389
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:34,967
Does he have one for every
one of ou r teachers?

390
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:36,246
I don't see them.

391
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:37,560
He didn't fuck
all our teachers.

392
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:38,801
He fucked all
of my teachers.

393
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:40,882
No, he never
fucked Mr. Hecht.

394
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:43,126
I did.

395
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:44,201
I'm just kidding.
(LAUGHS)

396
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:45,520
You know,
he wouldn't, but...

397
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:46,921
(GAS PS)

398
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,367
Oh, man!
Look at this.

399
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,845
AMY: Morn was
so fuckable then.

400
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:58,484
She had
the best tits.

401
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:02,050
When she would lay down,
they would just stay put.

402
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:03,610
Mine are just like,
"See ya!"

403
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:04,681
(CHUCKLES)

404
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:06,603
My titties are
like, "Peace!"

405
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:10,930
KIM: Dad was
such a dick.

406
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:13,806
(SIGHS)

407
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:16,531
I don't really
see it that way.

408
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:28,161
Can we mix it up
a little bit?

409
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:29,924
Will you talk
dirty to me?

410
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:32,246
Come on. Come on!

411
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:34,209
Amy, no. It's not
something I do well.

412
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:35,406
I'm not really
verbal, okay'?

413
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:37,323
I'm more physical
in how I communicate.

414
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:38,925
You're gonna be great at it.
I'm gonna sound stupid.

415
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:40,684
I don't wanna sound stupid.
You're not gonna sound stupid.

416
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:43,161
Clear your mind and say
whatever pops in it, okay?

417
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:45,641
Just try it.
Say anything.

418
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:47,246
All right.

419
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:50,209
I'm gonna give you
my full pecker. Yeah.

420
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:51,731
Okay.

421
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:53,290
Because of
the pecs,

422
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:55,488
but "pecker" is
kind of like my dick.

423
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:58,285
Yeah, I got it. I understood
what you meant by "pecker."

424
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:01,410
(GRUNTING) I'm gonna
fill you with protein.

425
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:03,205
I'm gonna give you
the protein you need

426
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:05,169
to survive when
you're making muscles.

427
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:06,680
I'm gonna put my
green drink in you.

428
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:10,003
Yeah. Beta-carotene
and vegetable mix.

429
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:11,451
Can it not be
about protein

430
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:13,682
or energy
or nutrition?

431
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:16,087
Can you just talk
about sex stuff?

432
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:20,646
All right. Yes. Just sexy stuff.

433
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:23,286
Talk to me.

434
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:26,207
There's no
"F, in "team"

435
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:27,805
but there's an
..l.. in "Win...

436
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:32,570
Can't spell "victory"
without "T-R-Y."

437
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:35,524
Winning isn't everything.
It's the only thing.

438
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:38,570
Okay, these are
just sports phrases.

439
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,768
Are these Nike slogans?
Please just...

440
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:42,445
You want the "Just do it"?
Do you want that one?

441
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:45,763
No! Just have sex with me
and say some dirty shit.

442
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:49,482
(SPEAKING IN MANDARIN)

443
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:50,561
What is that?

444
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:52,722
Talking to you dirty in Chinese.
That's what I'm doing.

445
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:55,004
What? I've been studying
Mandarin in my off time.

446
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:56,525
(SPEAKING IN MANDARIN)

447
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:58,170
"Do you need to go
to the bathroom?"

448
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:00,402
Please don't speak Chinese
or whatever during sex.

449
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:01,606
Okay, no problem.

450
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:04,160
I'm sorry. I don't mean
to be so picky.

451
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:06,288
You look discouraged
and you're doing great.

452
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:07,646
I told you I wasn't
gonna be any good at this.

453
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:08,881
Can we try
something else?

454
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:14,009
Yeah. Talk about
the first time you saw me.

455
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:16,641
Okay?

456
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:19,722
That's easy. I remember
it like it was yesterday.

457
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:21,245
Yeah?

458
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:22,685
I was just getting
done in the gym.

459
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:24,725
You were leaving that
pizza place, remember?

460
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:25,801
Yeah.

461
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:28,042
And you were holding on to that box.
(MOANING) Mmm-hmm.

462
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:31,284
And you walked out. You
were wearing those jeans.

463
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:33,488
0h' God! They looked
so good from behind.

464
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:34,891
Uh-huh!
Oh!

465
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:36,962
From behind...
Yeah, yeah.

466
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:38,565
...you looked like a dude. What?

467
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,086
Oh!

468
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:41,440
(GRUNTING)

469
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:52,810
Don't move! Don't move at all!
Anything!

470
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:54,450
Ah! You're moving
your arm.

471
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:00,451
Fudge ripple
ice cream!

472
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:01,881
Ah!

(GRUNTS)

474
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:06,844
Oh! Yeah!

00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:13,127
Oh...

477
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:15,009
That was great.

478
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:17,648
We gotta make that part of our program.
For sure.

479
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:19,125
Really onto something.

480
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:29,561

481
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,722
STEVEN: Amy, don't forget
to hydrate, babe.

482
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:37,364
We went verbal!

483
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:39,329
The boys make
the noise!

Yes, I'm loving it.

485

Rastaman! Digging it with the rolling bag.
Mixed messages.

486
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:50,361
Come back over here.
I love you on Glee.

487
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:52,528
How's it going? Amy,
what's happening?

488
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:53,761
You got a new sign?

489
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:56,969
Yeah, I'm working
a couple of ideas out.

490
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:59,281
Yeah. I'm going to
visit my dad.

491
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:00,805
Oh. How is he'?

492
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,248
We put him in an assisted
living facility.

493
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:05,129
I don't know how
nice it is, actually.

494
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:07,887
Oh. I know exactly
how you feel.

495
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:09,121
The car I take
a shit in,

496
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:10,440
they towed it.

497
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,007
Yeah.

498
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:14,560
Sucks. Sorry, man.
All right. I'll see you later.

499
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:16,051
I'll see you later.
I'll be here.

00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:18,407
Hey, I'm digging
that back camel toe.

501
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:20,889
NORMAN: What a
ridiculous statement!

502
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:24,885
You're talking about the most
talented player on all levels.

503
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:27,804
None of these bums
are the equal of Babe Ruth.

504
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:30,605
Norman, Babe Ruth was awful.
Stop it!

505
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:32,091
How can you
negate facts?

506
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:33,207
Just be nice to him.

507
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:35,567
I am nice to him.
He's not nice to me.

508
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:38,723
Babe Ruth was a superhero.
He was Superman!

509
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:40,968
Easy to be a Superman when
you never played against

510
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:42,166
a black guy
your whole life.

511
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:45,327
What does white/black
got to do with it?

512
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:47,402
Every 12-year-old kid in the
Dominican Republic right now

513
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:48,606
can probably
beat Babe Ruth.

514
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:50,330
Blah, blah, blah!

515
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:53,244
GORDON: Before 1947,
it's one big asterisk. Norman!

516
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:57,245
Can you just keep a low
profile for two weeks, here?

517
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:58,407
GORDON: Oh, I'm sorry.

518
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:00,323
I don't want to offend
any of these people

519
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,767

day and night, God forbid.

520
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:04,046
Can you just be
nice and make friends?

521
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:05,281
After T300...

522
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:06,771
After dinner,

523
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:09,161
it turns into Caligula
around here. Trust me.

524
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:11,131
Please.
It's a madhouse.

525
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:13,407
Ifs like the Playboy
Mansion, for Christ's sake.

526
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:15,403
This place?
Yes.

527
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:17,521
(SIGHS)

528
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:19,690
You got my Mets stuff?

529
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:21,441
Yeah.

530
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:23,601
Am?-

531
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:24,727
I'll bring it by.

532
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:27,647
Amy. Look at me.

533
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:30,761
Amy?

534
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:32,729
Kim made me throw
a lot of it away.

535
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:34,285
Kim made you? Your little sister?
Yes.

536
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:35,771
She's mean <i>as</i> a dog.

537
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:36,966
Jesus!

538
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:39,042
I tried. I'm so sorry.

539
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:42,168
What do I care? It's all
memorabilia, anyway.

540
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:43,810
I'm memorabilia
at this point.

541
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:46,251
Don't say that.

542
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:02,966
<i>ANN". Dr. Gunners'?</i>

543
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:05,243
Hi. Hey.
Hi.

544
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:06,367
Amy Townsend.

545
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:07,487
<i>Aaron Gunners.</i>

546
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:09,005
Great to meet you.
Nice to meet you.

547
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:10,491
Thank you so much
for letting me come in.

548
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:11,925
No worries.

549
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,968
Um, so...

550
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:15,121
How does
this work?

551
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:17,728
0h, uh, today is really
just to go over schedules.

552
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:18,926
Okay.

553
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,002
AMY: If that's cool.
Yeah, that's great.

554
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:23,401
Uh, I have never
been interviewed

555
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:24,561
for a magazine.
(KNOCKING)

556
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:25,687
<i>Hey . AARON". Hey , Lemon .</i>

557
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:26,841
Sorry, I don't mean
to interrupt.

558
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:28,251
Did I leave my
sunglasses here'?

559
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:30,683
I don't know.
Did you?

560
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:32,762
I was sitting...
Oh, here they are.

561
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:35,363
Did you just drive
40 minutes back here

562
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:36,487
to look for
your sunglasses?

563
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:37,846
Yeah, of course.
You think I'm gonna give

564
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:39,610
Sunglass Hut
another $30 for these?

565
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:40,681
You crazy?

566
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:42,250
Hey, how you doing? Hi.

567
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:44,641
Wait, your watch costs
more than my apartment.

568
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:46,085
Oh, this thing?
That was a gift.

569
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:47,650
We watching
Downton <i>Abbey</i> later?

570
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:50,127
Uh, if I get out of here on
time, yeah, we could watch it.

571
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:51,850
If not, let's do it tomorrow.
LEBRON: What?

572
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:52,921
I'm watching it tonight,

573
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,604
because I'm not gonna go to
practice in the morning,

574
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:56,842
and all the guys are talking
about it and I'm left out.

575
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:58,724
Hey, do what
you gotta do.

576
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:00,370
Can you validate
my parking, please?

577
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:02,562
I don't validate. You
should talk to Cheryl.

578
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:04,165
Okay, take care.
Nice meeting you.

579
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:05,730
AARON: Bye, LeBron.
Thanks, buddy.

580
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:08,007
LEBRON: Cheryl, can you
validate my parking, please?

581
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:11,049
Tall! Yeah, I know, right?

582
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:12,881
Do you know
who that was?

583
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:15,566
A basketball player.

584
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:18,530
He's LeBron James. He's kind
of "the" basketball player.

585
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:20,728
Oh, yeah. I think lsaw one
of his soda commercials.

586
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:21,801
Yeah.

587
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:23,046
Do you follow sports?

588
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:24,971
Oh, my God.

589
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:27,042
Sports? I love them.

590
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:28,281
Who are your
favorite teams?

591
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:32,769
I like smaller teams.
Not the big leagues.

592
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:35,605
I like the Long
Island Mediums.

593
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:39,002
The Acorn Pine Cones.

594
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:42,440
Haven't heard of them. The
Fire Island Penguins.

595
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:44,403
I like the Cincinnati
Thunder-Wizards.

596
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:45,766
You can stop.

597
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:47,205
The Orlando...

598
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:49,286
Blooms.

599
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:51,840
You can stop.
You don't follow sports.

600
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:54,322
I'm sorry, I don't.

601
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:55,765
I don't know
anything about sports.

602
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:57,524
You know what? That's okay, though.
Don't be embarrassed.

603
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:59,124
I'm sorry. No, don't
be embarrassed

604
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:01,362
because I actually didn't follow
sports until I got thisjob.

605
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:02,930
Really?
Yeah.

606
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:06,482
0h, my God! You have no idea
what a huge relief that is.

607
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:08,403
I was assigned this.

608
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:09,686
This was not
even my pitch.

609
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:12,130
Right. So you're
doing the article on me?

610
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:13,247
Mmm-hmm.

611
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:14,287
AWGSOMG.

612
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:17,728
I think they're kind of weird
and it's just strange.

613
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:20,724
Grown men wearing jerseys with
another man's name on it.

614
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:22,290
Like, are you in jail?
Are you his bitch?

615
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:24,606
Right. Kind of
like that one?

616
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:32,567
That's different,
because it's in a frame.

617
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:35,284
I think sports brings
people together.

618
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:36,725
It kind of forms
a community.

619
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:39,326
That's what I'm saying.
Right. Yeah. Obviously.

620
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:41,323
I'll tell you another thing
that's great about this job,

621
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:42,765
is that I get to
work with athletes,

622
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:45,161
which means that I
work with a lot of...

623
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:46,520
Black people?
...injuries.

624
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:48,523
What did you just say?
Did you say "black people"?

625
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:50,721
No.

626
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:52,326
Do you have a problem
with black people?

627
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:54,004
(CHUCKLING) No.
I love black people.

628
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:55,320
I prefer black people.

629
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:56,447
Do you have
black friends?

630
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:58,851
Endless black friends.

631
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:01,407
Can you show me pictures of your
black friends on your phone'?

632
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:05,251
You want 10 see pictures on
my phone of my black friends?

633
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:06,731
Amy, you gotta have
a lot of them.

634
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:10,009
I have so many. I'm deciding which
one, because there's so many.

635
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:12,048
Oh! Here we go. Oh, great.
Let's see it.

636
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:13,963
You're gonna be eating yourwords.
Oh, good.

637
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:15,121
You ready?
Yeah, I'm ready.

638
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:18,289
Okay, get ready.
Black friend.

639
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:21,481
AARON: That is you
and a white friend,

640
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:24,291
and that is a black
waiter pouring your water.

641
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:27,211
Let me find another one.
Oh. My phone died.

642
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:30,204
Um, I'm gonna let you
get back to doctoring.

643
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:31,361
Oh, thanks.

644
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:33,044
I'll talk to your...
Cheryl.

645
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:36,607
Cheryl about when we can meet again.
Yeah.

646
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:37,926
Great.

647
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:49,931
DANIEL RADCLIFFE: No,
we're not going into the park.

648
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:53,770
<i>We've been in
the park already.</i>

649
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:57,050
Sorry I'm late.
No, it's okay.

650
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:59,964
It's a wonderful film
Daniel Radcliffe is in.

651
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:02,250
What is this movie?

652
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:03,765
Radcliffe is
a dog walker,

653
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:06,404
but he's got a chip on his
shoulder, a real edge.

654
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:07,686
Sundance loved it.

655
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,968
<i>I need help
with my dog.</i>

656
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:12,890
<i>I can see that.</i>

657
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:16,131
<i>I would love to be the one
to help you with your dog.</i>

658
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,729
<i>What's your technique?</i>

659
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:21,881
<i>I put them on
a leash and walk them.</i>

660
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:24,404
<i>You talk a big game.</i>

661
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:27,607
<i>That's because
I walk a big dog.</i>

662
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:30,451
<i>MAREMQMEY.
She looks lime...</i>

663
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:32,126
Am?-

664
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:34,771
What's up?

665
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:36,171
Is that wine
in a box?

666
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:37,521
Mmm-hmm.

667
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:38,647
I have red, too.

668
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:39,721
STEVEN: You have red, too?

669
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:41,365
Is this guy
ever gonna shut up?

670
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:43,489
Please watch
the movie.

671
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:46,488
Stop. That's not right.
Don't do this to me.

672
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:47,846
Why is he yelling?

673
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:50,045
Listen, you always
do this to me.

674
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:52,282
You show up to these places,
you put me in a situation.

675
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:53,327
I'm a big guy.

676
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:55,044
Everybody wants to fight the big guy.
Yeah, you are.

677
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:57,487
Hey, Mark Wahlberg,
shut your bitch up.

678
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:01,049
Mark Wahlberg? Me?

679
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:03,886
Who else looks like Mark Wahlberg?
Your girl?

680
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:07,681
Mark Wahlbergs, like, 150 pounds.
I'm 250, lean.

681
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:10,604
I look like Mark Wahlberg
ate Mark Wahlberg!

682
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:12,603
Your muscles aren't
the fucking problem.

683
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:14,444
It's your
yapping girlfriend.

684
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:16,449
Just say "Fuck you." Yeah?

685
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:17,726
I will fuck you,
all right?

686
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:19,165
I will enter you!

687
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:21,483
You're gonna
"enter" me?

688
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:22,641
Did you hear
what he said?

689
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:24,370
What are you talking
about right now?

690
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:25,771
(WHISPERING) I'm just
trying to intimidate him.

691
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:27,524
You're talking
about raping him.

692
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:29,882
You're not about that life, champ.
I can see it.

693
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:31,530
Oh, I am about that life!
MAN: No, you're not.

694
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:33,807
No,no,no. I will get
crazy up in here.

695
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:35,729
You like movies?
We'll make a movie.

696
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:37,569
We'll <i>make Mama
Said Knock You Out</i>

697
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:39,404
starring my fist
and your dick hole.

698
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:40,881
MANI Oh, Shit!

699
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:42,121
What the fuck is
wrong with this dude?

700
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:43,281
He wants you.

701
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:45,647
Babe, your threats, I'm telling
you, they're super gay.

702
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:46,926
Too sexual?
Yeah.

703
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:49,850
This has to be the corniest,
muscled white dude

704
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:51,604
I've ever seen
in my fucking life.

705
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:54,290
Okay, Koko B. Ware,
you know what?

706
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:56,084
You're being
an asshole, all right'?

707
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:57,889
You know what I do with assholes?
I lick them.

708
00:27:58,360 --> 00:27:59,361
What the fuck?

709
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:00,930
He wants
to fuck you.

710
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:12,367
<i>My pooch has been
hurt more than enough.</i>

711
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:16,124
<i>I will make sure no one ever
hurts your pooch again.</i>

712
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:19,207
TOMEI: <i>I/ike when you're
taking control of your dogs.</i>

713
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:22,170
<i>RADCLIFFE:
I thought you would.</i>

714
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:24,486
I'm back.

715
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:28,440
What did I <i>miss?</i>

716
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:30,441
Amy, what did I miss?

717
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:34,444
They pre-butter it.

718
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:36,246
Who's Brody?

719
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:39,441
What?

720
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:41,568
Who's Oli?
Who's Brody?

721
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:44,365
Why do you have
my cell phone?

722
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:45,726
Why are you smiling?

723
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:47,450
I got a little
high outside.

724
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:49,249
Like, barely
at all high.

725
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:52,082
Okay, while you were
outside getting high,

726
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:54,049
I was putting your phone
on silent for the movie,

727
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:55,406
and when I did that,
I noticed you have

728
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:56,686
all these guys
in your phone.

729
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:58,683
There's Brody. There's a guy
listed as "Hot as Balls."

730
00:28:58,760 --> 00:28:59,921
Who the fuck is
"Hot as Balls"?

731
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:02,370
Stop smiling!
I'm not smiling.

732
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:03,601
Those are
guys from work.

733
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:06,566
Can we just
watch this movie?

734
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:08,330
You know what?
No, I can't.

735
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:09,970
Because as I was
turning off your phone,

736
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:11,565
lgot a picture
of somebody's dick.

737
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:12,920
Itwas mine.

738
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:16,923
Fuck you, Tone-Léc. You want to
take it to the parking lot? Fine!

739
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,731
You can't find me? I'll be
the closest one on Grindr.

740
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:23,446
That's 93Y-

741
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:27,083
Steven, please. lam not
in shape for this.

742
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:29,282
Stop walking like the Hulk.
I can see that you're mad.

743
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:30,600
You are being crazy!

744
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:33,286
Am I? Because I think you owe
me an explanation for this.

745
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:35,044
Do I have to worry
about you with other guys'?

746
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:36,246
I'm so high
right now.

747
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:38,891
Can we please talk about this tomorrow?
I'm too fucked up.

748
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:40,121
Amy, you're always
fucked up.

749
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:43,451
Answer the question. Are you
hooking up with other guys?

750
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:46,450
We never said we
were exclusive.

751
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:48,921
Fuck, Amy! "Exclusive"?
It's not high school.

752
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:52,727
You know, every single guy I
work outwith, every single guy,

753
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:55,130
says that all
you're gonna do

754
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:56,725
is mess with my
emotions and hurt me.

755
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:59,604
You guys talk
about that at the gym'?

756
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:02,486
Fuck, Amy! Do I have to worry
about you with other guys?

757
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:07,688
Yes, I hook up with other guys.
(GROANS)

758
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:11,521
I don't go to
the movies with them.

759
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:14,089
That's, like,
our special thing.

760
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:16,810
This is so
fucking stupid.

761
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:18,166
You know what
the sad part is'?

762
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:20,040
I was gonna ask
you to marry me.

763
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:23,966
Really?

764
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:27,481
I didn't even think
you liked me very much.

765
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:29,403
Why are you making me
feel bad about this?

766
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:30,925
You can sleep
with other girls.

767
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,604
It's like every
guy's dream.

768
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:34,685
It's not this
guy's dream.

769
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:37,044
Yeah, this guy's
got a dream,

770
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:40,081
and it's us
making it!

771
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:42,570
Getting married,

772
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:44,369
moving out to the
countryside, having a family.

773
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:46,647
Three boys and
two more boys.

774
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:48,842
Enough for a
basketball team.

775
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:52,005
And I'll develop a CrossFit
program and patent it.

776
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:54,600
And I'll rule
the CrossFit world.

777
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:57,204
With you by my side.

778
00:30:57,840 --> 00:30:59,842
<i>You can be my
Cross?“ Queen.</i>

779
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:02,441
That's my dream.

780
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:11,121
Hey.

781
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:13,681
Hey.

782
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:17,685
Can I leave?

783
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:21,203
Or, like, can you leave?

784
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:23,089
I just, like...
I'm very high,

785
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:25,367
and I just kind of need
this interaction to be over.

786
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:28,530
You serious?

787
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,606
Fuck you, Amy.
You are not nice.

788
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:37,810
I'm totally nice.

789
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:46,360
Maybe you should consider
changing your ways.

790
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:48,848
My "ways"?
Mmm-hmm.

791
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:50,405
You would love
having a family.

792
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:51,561
You sound
like Steven.

793
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:53,364
I wish I could
break up with you.

794
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:55,084
Having a family is fun.

795
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:56,764
That's fun?
Yeah.

796
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,081
They're having
a boys' lunch.

797
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:00,161
Here?

798
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:02,045
AMY: Hi!
Hi, ladies.

799
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:04,328
Urn, we're gonna have two mimosas.
Okay.

800
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:05,847
Okay.
Mmm-mmm.

801
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:08,520
No, you're right. Hold the orange juice.
No orange juice.

802
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:09,766
It's sugar.

803
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:11,251
So, champagne?

804
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:13,686
Ooh! Okay.

805
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:15,364
No, no.
No champagne for me.

806
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:17,442
Uh, yeah, we'll have
two champagnes.

807
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:18,965
Two champagnes.
Thanks.

808
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:20,889
Okay. We'll
see you in a bit.

809
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:24,211
Oh, my God. He's dying to fuck me.
Mmm-hmm.

810
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:25,361
Wait, why aren't
you drinking?

811
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:26,885
Have a drink with me.

812
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:30,927
Wait. No!

813
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:32,451
You're pregnant?

814
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:33,851
I'm pregnant.

815
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:35,321
Ugh!

816
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:36,606
Goa!

817
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:38,651
Tom's the father.

818
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:39,881
Ew!
(LAUGHS)

819
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:44,650
God. They look like
they're on a speed date.

820
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:46,210
Say "Congratulations."

821
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:47,481
(SCOFFS)

822
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:48,641
We're telling Dad.

823
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:51,291
I'll tell him at the
new nursing home.

824
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:52,407
The one that's cheaper.

825
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:55,168
It's not okay.
You're telling him.

826
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:58,242
GORDON: Kim,
are you serious?

827
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:00,163
Oh, my God.
Congratulations!

828
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:02,447
You're pregnant.
(LAUGHS)

829
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:04,249
Oh, my God.
Come here, come here.

830
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:06,485
GORDON: Oh!

831
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:09,404
My God! Oh, my God.

832
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:12,167
I'm tingling right now. I feel high.
(LAUGHING)

833
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:14,083
GORDON; I feel high!
That's incredible.

834
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:15,685
KIM: Thank you.

835
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:18,081
I'm finally gonna
be a grandfather.

836
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:20,370
You're already
a grandfather.

837
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:21,840
Not yet.

838
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:23,126
You're already
a grandfather.

839
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:24,890
Allister.
What's that?

840
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:26,121
Allister.
What about him?

841
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:27,486
That's your grandson.

842
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:29,244
Allister? (LAUGHS)

843
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:34,681
No, I mean, Allister's
your step-child

844
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:36,524
and my step-grandkid,
lguess.

845
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:38,045
But I'm talking
about your kid.

846
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:40,003
Our bloodlines!
That's... Yeah.

847
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:41,849
I was the first
person on my block

848
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:43,445
to own a television set.

849
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:45,489
That's really not
relevant right now, Norman.

850
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:47,005
It's not relevant.

851
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:48,525
Come on, that's more
like Tom's kid.

852
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:50,967
Ifs Tom's kid,
who you help with.

853
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:52,491
Dad, you love Allister.

854
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:53,891
GORDON; I like Allister.

855
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:56,406
I care for him,
I fear for him.

856
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:58,130
I know what happens to a kid
like that in the schoolyard.

857
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:00,248
We had a kid
like that. Stewie.

858
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:02,800
We used to beat him
mercilessly.

859
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:03,881
Oh!

860
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,604
Some of the beatings
I almost feel bad about.

861
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,684
That's gonna
happen to this kid.

862
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:09,723
I'm trying to protect him, trying
to teach him how to be a man.

863
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:10,801
I don't know what
you're talking about.

864
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:12,245
You were the
worst father ever.

865
00:34:12,680 --> 00:34:15,001
Come on.
I wasn't a bad father.

866
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:16,570
Mom did everything
when we were growing up.

867
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:18,244
You wouldn't understand
because you weren't there.

868
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:20,288
So, now your mother's a saint?
Of course she's a saint.

869
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:22,886
Of course, because once you
die, everybody's a saint.

870
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:24,246
Dad, just shut up.

871
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:26,448
We were talking about
this yesterday, right?

872
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:27,726
About Allister.
KIM: Amy?

873
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:30,087
No! He's lying.
Amy'?

874
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:31,844
Amy, come on, you said
he's the kind of kid

875
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:34,127
who drops his
pants to the floor

876
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:35,361
when he pees
in the urinal.

877
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:37,408
AMY: No, you said that!
GORDON: That's funny to guys.

878
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:39,130
AMY: I said he
pees sitting down.

879
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:41,402

AMY: Itwas a joke.

that you guys

I'm on your team.
You're not on my team!

Sorry if I'm excited more about my
grandkid than some step-grandkid.

Is that your wife?

00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:05,523
What is this speech
you have to make

889
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:07,204
for Doctors
With Borders?

890
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:09,124
"Without."
Without Borders.

891
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:10,281
Ifs "Doctors
Without Borders."

892
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:11,327
on. Right.

893
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:13,164
Yeah, it's Doctors
Without Borders.

894
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:15,322
It's a really
good organization.

895
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:18,483
Basically, we go to places
with the most conflict,

896
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:20,449
places with the
biggest disasters,

897
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:22,249
and we go in
and help people.

898
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:24,125
So, you help
people by choice,

899
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:25,406
and that's
what you like'?

900
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:29,566
Yeah. It's great work. It's very
rewarding, helping these people.

901
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:30,721
Wow!

902

What's your story? Are you a
Division One athlete or something?

903
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:37,804
Me? No, no. I was on the
Xbox that I was playing,

904
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:40,565
and then I got really high
and tripped on my bong.

905
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:41,967
Are you high?

906
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:43,041
Yeah.

So high.

new article right here.

All right.

913
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:55,284
So, this is our Sports Medicine
and Performance Center.

914
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:56,327
Wow.

915
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:57,686
This is where most
of our athletes come

916
00:35:57,800 --> 00:35:59,325
and do the
rehabilitation.

917
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:00,890
What does this do?

918
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:02,801
Come on.

919
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:05,885
So the HBM shows
how your muscles

920
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:07,883
are working
and moving,

921
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:10,327
so your rehab is
most effective.

922
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:12,801
It could help you with
your gait, your posture.

923
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:14,086
My gait?
(MACHINE BEEPS)

924
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:15,924
Mmm-hmm.
AMY: Okay.

925
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,570
So, just walk
normal for a second.

926
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:19,369
AMY: That looks pretty good.
Okay, okay.

927
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:21,761
Just walk naturally
for one second, please.

928

AMY: Like this'?

929
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:26,041
I walk like Beyoncé. People
always think I'm her.

00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:29,649
Is that how you walk down the street?
AMY: MMm-hmm.

932
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:32,046
No, this is how I walk.

933
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:34,964
I think the screen's doing different
stuff than what I'm doing.

934
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:36,884
What we can do with this,
is we could show

935
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:41,090
how you can, um, fix your
posture and your gait.

936
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:43,448

do a Hitler march.

walk down the street.

Who is this?

00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:07,401
Who? Kevin Spacey at end

I didn't see
that movie.

Oh. He's
Keyser Siize.

946

That's not important.
It's not a spoiler. Oh.

947
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:14,090

the speed a little hit?

That's good.

bit faster, if you want.

a little faster, actually.

1035
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:17,971
Can I read some of it?

1036
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:22,170
Yeah, you can read... You
can read some of my stuff.

1037
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:24,806
Do you want to
go get a drink'?

1038
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:27,169
Yeah.
Yeah? Okay.

1039
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,809
Can I get the check, please?
He understood.

1040
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:34,086
Don't do...

1041
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:35,406
Don't do the
symbol and yell.

1042
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:37,369
Just do one
or the other.

1043
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:38,727
What do you mean?

1044
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:40,290
You can mouih the word
"check" really loud

1045
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:41,407
and not make noise.

1046
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:43,005
And that's
kind of the best.

1047
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:44,525
What do I do?
Watch.

1048
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:47,370
Check.

1049
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:49,365
Okay, let me try.
Okay.

1050
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:51,690
(YELLS) Check?
(LAUGHS) No!

1051
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:53,481
No.

1052
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:55,684
Am I not doing that right? No!

1053
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:57,330
(YELLS) Check!
Oh, my God!

1054
00:40:57,400 --> 00:40:58,481
Could we get
the bill, please?

1055
00:40:58,600 --> 00:41:00,011
We'd like to pay
for the food.

1056
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:08,683
(BOTH LAUGHING)

1057
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:12,003
Okay, first kiss. This girl
named Jennifer Jennifer.

1058
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:13,286
Her name was
Jennifer Jennifer?

1059
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:14,486
Her name was
Jennifer Jennifer.

1060
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:15,891
And she was
very cute.

1061
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:18,122
It was a Halloween party,
seventh grade.

1062
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:20,965
She was shorter than me, she had
to stand up on a stone to kiss me.

1063
00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:22,730
Itwas like a Norman
Rockwell painting.

1064
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:23,881
It was very cute.

1065
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,048
Oh! And you see these teeth?
Yeah.

1066
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:28,085
Look at these teeth.

1067
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:30,162
They're fake,
they're porcelain.

1068
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:33,323
Ron Gardner,
seventh grade.

1069
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:35,846
I got brand new Air Jordans.
He wanted them.

1070
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:36,887
Yeah?

1071
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:38,689
He punched me in the
face and knocked out

1072
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:40,762
my teeth and
stole my shoes.

1073
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:42,723
No! You're getting a
lot of info from me.

1074
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:44,290
This is all off the
record, by the way.

1075
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:46,328
All off the record. AMY: Yeah,
off the record. Totally.

1076
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:48,169
Hey, today
was really fun.

1077
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:50,123
Yeah, it was great. I was a
little nervous about it.

1078
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:51,884
Yeah. But no, this
was a lot of fun.

1079
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:53,121
No, this was great.

1080
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:55,726
Um... If you want to maybe
come by tomorrow...

1081
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:56,847
Are you coming?

1082
00:41:56,920 --> 00:41:58,490
Oh!
You going downtown?

1083
00:41:58,600 --> 00:41:59,647
Sweet. Uh...

1084
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:02,570
AARON: Hi. Sorry.

1085
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:05,684
Uh, two stops.

1086
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:07,171
Just one stop.

1087
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:09,769
You want to give
him your address'?

1088
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,287
(STUTTERS)
Spring and Washington.

1089
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:28,004
AARON: So, this
is where I live.

1090
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:29,721
Uh...

1091
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:33,088
It's pretty sweet. Do you
want a drink or anything?

1092
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:34,969
AMY: No, thanks.
AARON: No? All right.

1093
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:36,041
Uh...

1094
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:38,330
This is the kitchen.

1095
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:39,891
Umm...

1096
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:41,007
It's a pretty
sweet place.

1097
00:42:41,120 --> 00:42:43,122
I've been here
for about a year.

1098
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:47,046
You know what? Let's get
some tunes on in this place.

1099
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:50,090
Holy shit.
(REMOTE CLATTERS)

1100
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:51,605
Hi.
Hi.

1101
00:42:53,960 --> 00:42:55,564
(KISSING)

1102
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:01,124
So we're gonna
do this now?

1103
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:02,929
We are gonna
do this now.

1104
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:04,081
Okay, that's...

1105
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:05,641
Is that okay?

1106
00:43:05,720 --> 00:43:06,767
That's cool, yeah.

1107
00:43:06,840 --> 00:43:07,841
Whoa!

1108
00:43:12,040 --> 00:43:14,088
Do you own this place?
Are you renting it?

1109
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:15,571
I own it.

1110
00:43:15,640 --> 00:43:17,369
Cool, that's
really nice.

1111
00:43:23,360 --> 00:43:24,771
Oh, shit.
Yeah.

1112
00:43:24,840 --> 00:43:26,205
We're doing this
right now?

1113
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:27,611
We are doing
this right now.

1114
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:29,091
We are off
to the races.

1115
00:43:29,160 --> 00:43:31,208
Yeah, it's happening. Okay.

1116
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:33,004
All right.
That's nice.

1117
00:43:34,840 --> 00:43:37,081
Oh, man.
Oh, God!

1118
00:43:38,360 --> 00:43:40,044
0h, my God!

1119
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:41,321
Good for you.

1120
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:43,050
Yeah, thank you.

1121
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:44,207
I didn't see
this for you.

1122
00:43:44,280 --> 00:43:45,406
<i>Uh , yeah'?
Mmm-hmm.</i>

1123
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:49,045
(BOTH SIGH)

1124
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:56,041
Okay.

1125
00:43:56,880 --> 00:43:58,086
I'm gonna head out.

1126
00:43:58,160 --> 00:43:59,321
Oh, no.

1127
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:00,731
Thank you.

1128
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:03,009
Why don't you
stay over?

1129
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:06,647
Yes. No, I'm not gonna
stay here. I just...

1130
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:08,370
You have an
early day, I bet.

1131
00:44:08,440 --> 00:44:10,010
No, it's fine.

1132
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:20,085
(EXHALES DEEPLY)

1133
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:26,365
Are you comfortable?
No. No, I'm not.

1134
00:44:26,440 --> 00:44:28,204
I don't really
like to spoon.

1135
00:44:28,280 --> 00:44:29,281
Oh.

1136
00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:32,645
Okay. Yeah, sorry. Can we...

1137
00:44:33,240 --> 00:44:34,321
If I stay here,
can we just sleep

1138
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:36,010
in a realistic position?

1139
00:44:36,080 --> 00:44:37,684
Sure, yeah.

1140
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:39,285
Because I'm
a light sleeper,

1141
00:44:39,360 --> 00:44:43,410
and if I feel you
move or sweat or breathe,

1142
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:45,050
I'll wake up
and just lay here

1143
00:44:45,160 --> 00:44:47,242
resenting you
all night.

1144
00:44:47,320 --> 00:44:48,526
So, yeah, can we...

1145
00:44:48,600 --> 00:44:50,602
Actually, could we put
this pillow in between us?

1146
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:52,768
That'll be good. Put
the pillow between us?

1147
00:44:52,840 --> 00:44:54,171
Yeah, that's not
your main pillow

1148
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:55,526
that you use, is it'?

1149
00:44:55,600 --> 00:44:56,931
No.
Okay, cool.

1150
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,241
Let's kind of
get that in there.

1151
00:44:59,320 --> 00:45:00,560
Thank you.
Okay.

1152
00:45:01,640 --> 00:45:02,801
Yeah.

1153
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:07,446
I'm sorry
I'm nit-picking,

1154
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:09,921
but you're breathing on me
pretty hard right now.

1155
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:11,286
Yeah, it's like
a strong wind.

1156
00:45:11,360 --> 00:45:12,566
What do you
need me to do?

1157
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:15,689
Breathe up towards the sky
and not at me. (SIGHS)

1158
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:17,046
Yeah, you got it.

1159
00:45:17,120 --> 00:45:18,281
Sorry, it's
just a lot.

1160
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:22,047
Like this? Are you
feeling better?

1161
00:45:22,120 --> 00:45:24,930
Let me see. Do it and <i>I'll
</i> tell you if I can feel it.

1162
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:28,769
I'm still getting
a little bit of a wind.

1163
00:45:28,840 --> 00:45:30,410
Oh... Jesus.

1164
00:45:31,160 --> 00:45:32,366
Do you want me
to go home?

1165
00:45:32,440 --> 00:45:33,646
I can sleep at home.

1166
00:45:33,720 --> 00:45:35,484
No, this is
so worth it.

1167
00:45:35,640 --> 00:45:36,641
(SIGHS)

1168
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:41,488
Nikki, just hurry up
and get here.

1169
00:45:42,840 --> 00:45:43,807
When you're
writing an article,

1170
00:45:43,880 --> 00:45:45,370
do you always use
a tape recorder?

1171
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:46,601
No.

1172
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:48,769
Um, when you're
writing an article,

1173
00:45:48,840 --> 00:45:51,366
what are the 10 biggest
mistakes you could make?

1174
00:45:52,120 --> 00:45:55,522
Plagiarizing, getting
drunk, fucking someone.

1175
00:45:56,560 --> 00:45:58,608
Have you ever seen any kind
of article about a fetish

1176
00:45:58,680 --> 00:46:01,365
where guys like to
masturbate to hockey fights?

1177
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:03,290
That's not a thing.
Not a thing.

1178
00:46:03,360 --> 00:46:05,044
Then Why'd it
work for me?

1179
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:07,284
We're in the middle
of something, so...

1180
00:46:07,360 --> 00:46:08,885
Yeah. Seriously, right?

1181
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:09,961
(CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY)

1182
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:13,286
Okay, so, that
actually brings me

1183
00:46:13,360 --> 00:46:15,124
to an interesting
line of questioning.

1184
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:17,601
You know what? Uh, they're
gonna want you to just do

1185
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:19,603
a bunch of web stuff
because you're younger.

1186
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:22,081
Everyone has a boner for young
people on the Internet, okay?

1187
00:46:22,200 --> 00:46:23,531
They think you have the key to it.
DIANNA: Amy!

1188
00:46:23,600 --> 00:46:25,841
That's why we'll do anything
we can to help you here.

1189
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:27,285
Right, but when you're
writing an article...

1190
00:46:27,360 --> 00:46:28,407
Sorry, talk to me
about it later.

1191
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:29,447
Just write
them all down.

1192
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:30,521
I'll be
helpful later.

1193
00:46:32,680 --> 00:46:33,681
Okay.

1194
00:46:33,840 --> 00:46:35,968
I like you, Amy. I do, you know?

1195
00:46:36,040 --> 00:46:38,122
You're clever, but
you're not too brainy.

1196
00:46:38,200 --> 00:46:41,807
You're pretty-ish and you're not gorgeous.
You're approachable.

1197
00:46:41,880 --> 00:46:42,961
Thank you.
Yeah.

1198
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:45,122
I want this promotion
for you, Amy, you know'?

1199
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:47,009
I want you to
help me to help you.

1200
00:46:47,080 --> 00:46:48,923
I need to go up there,
to the men upstairs.

1201
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:51,327
I need you to provide
me with the ammo

1202
00:46:51,400 --> 00:46:54,085
to get them to know that you
can handle their workload.

1203
00:46:54,200 --> 00:46:55,929
Can you handle
their load, Amy?

1204
00:46:56,080 --> 00:46:58,128
I can handle all their loads.
That's it.

1205
00:47:01,480 --> 00:47:02,481

1206
00:47:02,920 --> 00:47:04,604
Hey. Where have you been?

1207
00:47:04,680 --> 00:47:05,886
Sorry, I was
getting a smoothie.

1208
00:47:05,960 --> 00:47:07,121
Can you sit, please?

1209
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:10,447
I slept at the doctor's
place last night.

1210
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:12,847
Oh, my God, because you
were blackout drunk?

1211
00:47:12,920 --> 00:47:16,641
No, that's the thing. I was dead sober.
I had like two drinks.

1212
00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:18,131
Three, max.

1213
00:47:18,200 --> 00:47:21,044
Four, now that I'm tallying.
But I was sober.

1214
00:47:21,120 --> 00:47:23,009
So you barely drank?
Barely.

1215
00:47:23,080 --> 00:47:24,445
Because you're on
antibiotics or something?

1216
00:47:24,520 --> 00:47:26,443
No, lspent the
night on purpose.

1217
00:47:26,520 --> 00:47:28,409
I don't understand.
I don't understand.

1218
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:29,561
When you think
about the sex,

1219
00:47:29,640 --> 00:47:30,926
are you just
kind of like...

1220
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:34,164
No. I'm like...

1221
00:47:37,600 --> 00:47:38,601
So, you're like...

1222
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:42,609
No, that's not what I'm doing.

1225

1233
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:02,407
He called me
on purpose.

1234
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:04,801
Hang up. He's obviously
sick or something.

1235
00:48:05,480 --> 00:48:06,447
<i>Yeah, what's up?</i>

1236
00:48:06,520 --> 00:48:08,124
I was calling to say I had a
really good time last night.

1237
00:48:08,200 --> 00:48:10,487
I was wondering if you wanted
to, um, hang out again.

1238
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:13,329
Will you say
that again, please?

1239

if I could see you again.</i>

gonna call the police.

to you about it

1244
00:48:24,120 --> 00:48:26,202

00:48:26,280 --> 00:48:27,566
<i>okay, We-</i>

1246
00:48:27,640 --> 00:48:29,165

That's pretty
cool, man.

1249

I didn't get 10 hear the
whole conversation, though.

1250

We're gonna
talk about it

1251

when we see each
other tomorrow.

1252
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:39,126
That's great, man.

1253
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:40,690
Yeah, she's got
a sexy voice.

1254
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:42,087
Did you guys
make love?

1255
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:45,161
Yeah.
Oh!

1256
00:48:46,040 --> 00:48:47,041
<i>Whom!</i>

1257
00:48:47,160 --> 00:48:48,525
My boy got intimate. Yeah.

1258
00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:49,846
Sexual intercourse!
Whoa!

1259
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:51,888
Do you want to just
announce it to everybody?

1260
00:48:51,960 --> 00:48:55,726
My boy got a girlfriend.
Man, it's been forever!

1261
00:48:55,800 --> 00:48:58,087
Yeah. I'm not gonna lie.
It's been a while.

1262
00:48:58,160 --> 00:49:00,561
Yeah, it's been
six years since Sheila.

1263
00:49:00,680 --> 00:49:02,569
And that only lasted five weeks.
Yep.

1264
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:03,641
There was Debbie.

1265
00:49:03,720 --> 00:49:05,609
Debbie didn't even
tell you where she lived.

1266
00:49:05,680 --> 00:49:06,681
Yeah, she thought
I was a psycho.

1267
00:49:06,760 --> 00:49:08,250
She kept calling
me "Dexter."

1268
00:49:08,360 --> 00:49:09,725
What I'm saying is,
you got to go for it.

1269
00:49:09,840 --> 00:49:11,569
You need to focus if you want
to take it to the next level.

1270
00:49:11,640 --> 00:49:12,607
Right.

1271
00:49:12,720 --> 00:49:14,085
You have to. You got
to give it everything

1272
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:15,400
if you want
this one, man.

1273
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:18,444
It like, when I lost the
Championship in 2011,

1274
00:49:18,520 --> 00:49:20,284
I worked on my
game twice as hard,

1275
00:49:20,360 --> 00:49:22,044
worked on my
post-up game,

1276
00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:24,242
and we wound up winning
the Championship, twice.

1277
00:49:24,360 --> 00:49:25,486
Yeah. Yeah.

1278
00:49:25,560 --> 00:49:26,800
I don't feel like
that applies to me.

1279
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:29,247
But I appreciate
the thought.

1280
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:31,801
Aaron, you have to take a risk.
You have to. Yeah, you're right.

1281
00:49:31,880 --> 00:49:33,962
Ifs like, when I decided
to go back to Cleveland,

1282
00:49:34,040 --> 00:49:36,611
I wasn't totally sure they was
gonna welcome me back, man.

1283
00:49:36,680 --> 00:49:38,170
But they did.
They welcomed me back

1284
00:49:38,240 --> 00:49:40,129
with open arms
and an open heart.

1285
00:49:40,720 --> 00:49:44,406
Yeah, they did. Again, I feel
that applies more to you.

1286
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:46,764
I don't even
live in Cleveland.

1287
00:49:46,840 --> 00:49:48,524
But, again, I
appreciate the thought.

1288
00:49:48,600 --> 00:49:49,681
Cleveland, Ohio?

1289
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:51,842
You're talking about the home of
The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

1290
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:54,048
Or maybe we go down lo Canton to
the Pro Football Hall of Fame.

1291
00:49:54,120 --> 00:49:55,531
Did you know Superman
was created in Cleveland?

1292
00:49:55,600 --> 00:49:57,443
Yeah, I know Superman
was created in Cleveland.

1293
00:49:57,520 --> 00:49:59,010
You've told me that
a number of times.

1294
00:49:59,120 --> 00:50:00,884
You ever seen a Cuyahoga sunset?
No.

1295
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:02,325
Do you know Cleveland's
great for the whole family?

1296
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:05,131
Yes. Yes, I do. You tell
me that all the time.

1297
00:50:05,240 --> 00:50:07,288
You randomly just text me that.
And what's wrong with that?

1298
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:09,966
Which is weird. It's weird.
I got free texting.

1299
00:50:10,040 --> 00:50:11,769
Why are you trying to always
sell me on Cleveland?

1300
00:50:11,880 --> 00:50:13,291
When are you gonna
come to Cleveland?

1301
00:50:14,240 --> 00:50:17,130
(STAMMERING) I'll come
when I have the time.

1302
00:50:17,240 --> 00:50:18,321
I just don't have
the time right now.

1303
00:50:18,440 --> 00:50:20,204
I'll come when I have the time.
I've just been really busy.

1304
00:50:20,280 --> 00:50:21,691
You visit me in
Miami all the time.

1305
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:23,330
Yeah, but that's
Miami. I mean...

1306
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:26,448
What's the difference between
Miami and Cleveland?

1307
00:50:26,560 --> 00:50:27,641
It's the same.

1308
00:50:29,720 --> 00:50:31,006
You're right,
it's the same.

1309
00:50:31,080 --> 00:50:32,411
Exactly.

1310
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:37,004
Okay, so you had the salmon.
That's about 14 dollars.

1311
00:50:37,120 --> 00:50:38,963
What are you doing, man?
You had two Cokes.

1312

Dude, are you trying
to split the bill'?

1313
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:43,360
Look, I told you those
refills weren't free.

1314
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:44,646
No, no, no, we're
not splitting the bill.

1315
00:50:44,720 --> 00:50:45,801
Pick up the check.

1316
00:50:46,600 --> 00:50:47,647
Why do I have to
pick up the check'?

1317
00:50:47,720 --> 00:50:48,767
Because you're

1318

Listen, don't look at
me no differently now

1319
00:50:50,720 --> 00:50:52,290
just because
I got a little money.

1320
00:50:52,760 --> 00:50:54,683
Look, I don't know how
long this could last.

1321
00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:56,290
Anything can happen.
Right.

1322
00:50:56,360 --> 00:50:58,283
I'm not about to
end up like MC Hammer.

You know what?

1325
00:51:01,960 --> 00:51:04,611
I'll pay it, but you got to pick
up a check every once in a while.

1326
00:51:04,680 --> 00:51:05,886
No, don't pay
the whole thing.

1327
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:07,126
Just pay your part.

All right, fine.
All right.

00:51:12,080 --> 00:51:13,081
I'll put my
credit card in.

1331
00:51:13,160 --> 00:51:15,083

we'll split it.

Nothing.

1379
00:53:28,040 --> 00:53:29,610
He's supposed to
ring his call button

1380
00:53:29,680 --> 00:53:31,205
if he wants to get
out of his chair.

1381
00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:32,247
He has fallen.

1382

1384

I could treat him.

in my country.

1400
00:54:04,320 --> 00:54:05,765
What's the point?
Just leave it.

1401

like Kate Middleton for?

1402

Here we go.

00:59:50,120 --> 00:59:51,167
Excuse me?

1544
00:59:52,160 --> 00:59:53,241
When you're
looking at clouds,

1545
00:59:53,360 --> 00:59:54,600
do you see his face?

1546
00:59:56,760 --> 00:59:58,091
Do you hear
his name

1547
00:59:58,160 --> 01:00:00,003
when you listen
to the wind?

1548
01:00:00,920 --> 01:00:01,921
Um...

1549
01:00:03,200 --> 01:00:04,440
YES.

1550
01:00:06,080 --> 01:00:07,650
I really have to
ask you a question.

1551
01:00:08,880 --> 01:00:10,564
Don't hurt him.

1552
01:00:18,400 --> 01:00:21,131
<i>AW: So we did it. Okay?</i>

1553
01:00:21,200 --> 01:00:23,168

Whoa! Easy, dude.
I'm a working man, too.

1563
01:00:46,880 --> 01:00:48,006
All right,
I get it.

1564
01:00:48,120 --> 01:00:49,121
Hey, Noam.

1565
01:00:49,200 --> 01:00:50,281
Hey, guys!

01:00:50,360 --> 01:00:52,601
Whoa! Inside sex!
I'm digging that.

<i>I was dared to do that.</i>

1575
01:01:28,400 --> 01:01:30,084
So what's up with you and Amy?
How's that going?

1576
01:01:30,160 --> 01:01:32,288
Amy? Things are
going awesome, man.

1577
01:01:32,360 --> 01:01:33,771
Yeah?
Yeah.

1578
01:01:34,920 --> 01:01:37,366
Yeah. lfs going
real good.

1579
01:01:37,440 --> 01:01:39,044
I mean, I really,
really like her,

1580
01:01:39,120 --> 01:01:41,487
but she's got
some issues, you know'?

1581
01:01:42,440 --> 01:01:43,771
I mean, that's gonna happen.

1582
01:01:43,840 --> 01:01:45,330
AARON; Yeah.

1583
01:01:45,400 --> 01:01:47,129
Like, last night we
went out drinking.

1584
01:01:47,240 --> 01:01:48,969
You? Yeah, lwent out drinking.

1585
01:01:49,040 --> 01:01:50,166
And she...

1586
01:01:55,120 --> 01:01:56,201
I don't drink.
I got hammered.

1587
01:01:56,280 --> 01:01:58,647
And then she drank a lot,
but she barely got...

(SNEAKERS SQUEAKING)

1589
01:02:00,640 --> 01:02:02,563
But she didn't
get drunk at all.

1590
01:02:11,680 --> 01:02:12,408
You use
protection, right'?

1591
01:02:12,480 --> 01:02:13,447
Yeah.

1592
01:02:13,520 --> 01:02:15,522
Yeah, yeah. She's got
little bowls of condoms

1593
01:02:15,600 --> 01:02:16,601
all around
her apartment.

1594
01:02:16,680 --> 01:02:17,761
Condoms?

1595
01:02:17,840 --> 01:02:18,887
I'm not talking
about condoms.

1596
01:02:18,960 --> 01:02:21,088
I'm talking about
protection, like a lawyer.

1597
01:02:21,160 --> 01:02:23,845
Like a nondisclosure
agreement, you know'?

1598
01:02:24,200 --> 01:02:27,170
No penetration
without representation.

1599
01:02:27,800 --> 01:02:29,450
Yeah, you're right.

1600
01:02:29,960 --> 01:02:30,961
What happened?

1601
01:02:31,040 --> 01:02:32,769
Nothing, man.

1602
01:02:32,840 --> 01:02:34,001
Listen, I'll tell
you one thing.

1603
01:02:34,080 --> 01:02:35,241
You don't wanna
have a baby mama.

1604
01:02:35,320 --> 01:02:36,481
The next thing
you know,

1605
01:02:36,560 --> 01:02:37,607
you're paying
for a Ferrari.

1606
01:02:37,680 --> 01:02:39,762
You're getting her a big
house, a big mansion.

1607
01:02:39,840 --> 01:02:41,251
She's gonna want to
start a jumpsuit line,

1608
01:02:41,360 --> 01:02:42,646
and you're gonna
have to pay for it.

1609
01:02:42,720 --> 01:02:44,051
You wanna
go through that'?

1610
01:02:44,120 --> 01:02:45,167
You gotta convince
one of your friends

1611
01:02:45,280 --> 01:02:47,123
to say he's the dad
and raise the child.

1612
01:02:47,240 --> 01:02:48,605
Who wants to
go through that?

1613
01:02:48,680 --> 01:02:49,886
Kid end up
being 67",

1614
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:51,445
your best friend only 5'2".
Mmm-hmm.

1615
01:02:51,520 --> 01:02:52,931
Eighteen years later,
the kid comes

1616
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:54,729
and he writes
a book about you

1617
01:02:54,800 --> 01:02:56,404
saying how much of
a jackass you are.

1618
01:02:56,680 --> 01:02:58,603
Eighteen years, man.
18 years.

1619
01:02:58,680 --> 01:03:01,331
Your baby mama's car and
crib is bigger than his.

1620
01:03:01,400 --> 01:03:03,402
You could turn on
the TV any given Sunday.

1621
01:03:03,480 --> 01:03:06,404
Win the Super Bowl
and drive off in a Hyundai.

1622
01:03:06,480 --> 01:03:09,086
She was supposed to get the
shorty Tyco with your money.

1623
01:03:09,160 --> 01:03:11,447
Then she went to the doctor,
got Iipo with your money.

1624
01:03:11,520 --> 01:03:12,760
What are you
talking about?

1625
01:03:12,840 --> 01:03:14,649
What the fuck are
you talking about?

1626
01:03:14,720 --> 01:03:15,687
It's Kanye.

1627
01:03:15,760 --> 01:03:17,489
You're quoting
Kanye West to me?

1628
01:03:17,560 --> 01:03:19,642
You know what?
Amy's not like that.

1629
01:03:19,720 --> 01:03:22,087
Amy's not like that at all.
She's awesome.

1630
01:03:22,160 --> 01:03:23,241
And this is
gonna be great.

1631
01:03:23,360 --> 01:03:25,408
I think she's cool, and I don't
think I have to worry about that.

1632
01:03:25,480 --> 01:03:26,811
All right.

1633
01:03:27,720 --> 01:03:28,767
Oh!

1634
01:03:28,840 --> 01:03:29,966
Did you
let me do that?

1635
01:03:30,040 --> 01:03:31,451
Did I just score on you?

1636
01:03:31,520 --> 01:03:34,888
Yes! You are my bitch,
LeBron James!

1637
01:03:34,960 --> 01:03:36,450
But not really.
Not really.

1638
01:03:36,880 --> 01:03:38,962
You gotta admit, that was a good shot.
Come on, man.

1639
01:03:39,040 --> 01:03:40,485
I scored on
LeBron James.

1640
01:03:40,560 --> 01:03:41,800
I'm never playing
basketball again.

1641
01:03:41,920 --> 01:03:43,490
Lunch is on
you, buddy!

1642
01:03:43,560 --> 01:03:44,561
LEBRON: Where are
you going, Aaron?

1643
01:03:44,640 --> 01:03:45,641
AARON; Whoo!

1644
01:03:45,920 --> 01:03:47,081
Aaron?

1645
01:03:49,160 --> 01:03:50,366
<i>Lemon .</i>

1646
01:03:52,400 --> 01:03:53,401
<i>Whom!</i>

1647
01:03:54,400 --> 01:03:55,765
God damn it!

1648
01:03:59,080 --> 01:04:00,605
How's work?

1649
01:04:01,600 --> 01:04:04,080
Work's great,
actually.

1650
01:04:04,160 --> 01:04:05,969
I think I'm gonna
get that editorjob.

1651
01:04:06,040 --> 01:04:09,123
Aaron's been kind of pushing
me to think bigger.

1652
01:04:09,240 --> 01:04:11,686
Can I just
do this, please?

1653
01:04:11,760 --> 01:04:14,366
Aaron was telling me
about this acupuncturist.

1654
01:04:14,440 --> 01:04:15,521
She's supposedly amazing.

1655
01:04:15,600 --> 01:04:17,523
She helps a lot of his
patients with pain management.

1656
01:04:17,600 --> 01:04:20,001
I really want herto take a look at you.
Will you do that?

1657
01:04:20,080 --> 01:04:22,048
I have no desire
for an Oriental woman

1658
01:04:22,120 --> 01:04:23,610
to touch me
above the waist.

1659
01:04:24,880 --> 01:04:26,211
Don't say that.
That's disgust...

1660
01:04:26,280 --> 01:04:27,406
It's Asian.
Just say Asian.

1661
01:04:27,480 --> 01:04:30,006
Why does Aaron
all of a sudden

1662
01:04:30,080 --> 01:04:31,445
know everything
about everything?

1663
01:04:32,120 --> 01:04:34,248
He's a doctor.
He knows something.

1664
01:04:34,320 --> 01:04:36,721
He's a sports doctor. He's not
a real doctor, let's face it.

1665
01:04:36,800 --> 01:04:39,167
A real doctor
tries to cure diseases.

1666
01:04:39,240 --> 01:04:41,561
He's trying to get courtside
<i>seats</i> for the playoffs.

1667
01:04:41,640 --> 01:04:43,688
You're saying sports doctors
aren't real doctors?

1668
01:04:43,760 --> 01:04:45,364
Yeah. When they say, "What
do you wanna focus on?"

1669
01:04:45,440 --> 01:04:47,044
"I wanna focus on MS."

1670
01:04:47,120 --> 01:04:49,407
"What do you wanna focus on?"
"I wanna focus on cancer."

1671
01:04:49,480 --> 01:04:50,527
"What about you?"

1672
01:04:50,600 --> 01:04:53,365
"Whatever gets me closest
to men's locker rooms."

1673
01:04:53,440 --> 01:04:54,407
Okay.

1674
01:04:54,480 --> 01:04:58,246
"I want giant, athletic
penises close to my face,

1675
01:04:58,320 --> 01:05:00,084
"while I'm pretending
to look at their knees."

1676
01:05:00,160 --> 01:05:01,366
He's a good doctor,

1677
01:05:01,440 --> 01:05:02,566
and he does a lot with
Doctors Without Borders.

1678
01:05:02,640 --> 01:05:03,687
He's a great guy.

1679
01:05:03,760 --> 01:05:06,286
I'm not saying
he's not a good guy,

1680
01:05:06,360 --> 01:05:07,771
but he's got
about a month left

1681
01:05:07,880 --> 01:05:09,803
before you give
him the boot, right'?

1682
01:05:10,600 --> 01:05:11,567
What does that mean?

1683
01:05:11,640 --> 01:05:14,450
He's a reaction from the
muscle-bound Knucklehead,

1684
01:05:14,520 --> 01:05:16,363
so now you go for
the nerdy brainiac.

1685
01:05:16,440 --> 01:05:18,602
I know the way your
pattern works, Amy.

1686
01:05:18,680 --> 01:05:19,886
It's my pattern.

1687
01:05:19,960 --> 01:05:21,564
No, Dad,
lreallylike him.

1688
01:05:21,640 --> 01:05:24,007
I want you to be nice to him, and
I want you to take it seriously.

1689
01:05:24,080 --> 01:05:25,081
Will you do that'?

1690
01:05:25,160 --> 01:05:26,650
I think we have
a real shot.

1691
01:05:26,720 --> 01:05:27,721
That's great.

1692
01:05:27,800 --> 01:05:29,404
You sound like
a Lifetime movie.

1693
01:05:29,800 --> 01:05:31,768
One of the happy ones,
not the murder ones.

1694
01:05:31,840 --> 01:05:33,808
Don't you want
me to be happy? I mean...

1695
01:05:33,880 --> 01:05:36,850
You're building him up, and you're
gonna let yourself in for a big fail.

1696
01:05:38,400 --> 01:05:39,686
He's gonna
break your heart.

1697
01:05:41,400 --> 01:05:42,447
I'm leaving.

1698
01:05:43,080 --> 01:05:44,650
AMY: I'll talk to you later.

1699
01:05:44,720 --> 01:05:46,324
I'll tell Temembe
to come get you.

1700
01:05:46,400 --> 01:05:49,244
GORDON: Amy,
don't leave like this.

1701
01:05:49,840 --> 01:05:52,969
I don't like it when you don't
talk to me for a while.

1702
01:06:01,480 --> 01:06:03,084
Thank you so much
for doing this with me.

1703
01:06:03,160 --> 01:06:05,322
No, lwanna be
doing this with you.

1704
01:06:06,040 --> 01:06:07,963
Ifs the only one I've ever
done that we've framed.

1705
01:06:08,040 --> 01:06:09,280
WENDY: It looks great.

1706
01:06:09,400 --> 01:06:10,561
It seems like a
regional thing.

1707
01:06:10,800 --> 01:06:11,767
Girl!

1708
01:06:11,840 --> 01:06:14,366

Ifs really nice
to meet you.

1712
01:06:18,720 --> 01:06:20,484
You're Tom? Pleasure
to meet you.

1713
01:06:20,560 --> 01:06:22,801
Hey, Amy.
How are you'?

1714
01:06:22,880 --> 01:06:25,531
Congrats on trapping my
sister with your seed.

1715
01:06:25,600 --> 01:06:28,171
Well, not all sex ends with a
ﬂush and a cry. (CHUCKLES)

1716
01:06:28,240 --> 01:06:30,368
Sometimes you get this. (LAUGHS)

1717
01:06:30,440 --> 01:06:31,885
That's killer.
KIM: Come on in!

1718
01:06:31,960 --> 01:06:33,007
I'll get you
guys a drink.

1719
01:06:33,080 --> 01:06:34,570
Anything that
you want.

1720
01:06:34,640 --> 01:06:36,290
I haven't been to a
baby shower in years.

1721
01:06:36,360 --> 01:06:37,361
We're so glad
you made it.

1722
01:06:37,440 --> 01:06:39,124
Yeah. Hey,
congratulations, man.

1723
01:06:39,200 --> 01:06:42,283
So I hear that you
work with athletes.

1724
01:06:42,360 --> 01:06:44,328
Yeah, I'm a physician
and a surgeon.

1725
01:06:44,400 --> 01:06:46,289
Mostly work with
the Knicks right now.

1726
01:06:46,360 --> 01:06:48,044
ALL: Ooh. TIM: That
sounds very cool.

1727
01:06:48,120 --> 01:06:49,804
Yeah, yeah.

1728
01:06:49,880 --> 01:06:51,723
And other athletes.

1729
01:06:52,080 --> 01:06:54,321
Really?
Like, which ones?

1730
01:06:54,400 --> 01:06:56,767
Specifically,
which athletes?

1731
01:06:57,080 --> 01:06:58,366
Uh... Tom Brady.

1732
01:06:58,440 --> 01:06:59,646
(ALL EXCLAIM)

1733
01:06:59,720 --> 01:07:01,165
Yeah.

1734
01:07:01,240 --> 01:07:03,481
Any other athletes
that you, uh, work with'?

1735
01:07:03,720 --> 01:07:05,563
Uh... Jay Cutler.

1736
01:07:05,640 --> 01:07:08,371
ALL: Whoa! Yeah, lwork with him.

1737
01:07:08,440 --> 01:07:09,566
Do you guys
follow tennis?

1738
01:07:09,640 --> 01:07:10,641
ALL: Yeah.

1742
01:07:15,440 --> 01:07:17,044
Whoa!

1743
01:07:17,120 --> 01:07:18,565

Fuck that guy!

KEVIN: Yeah.

1748
01:07:24,840 --> 01:07:26,001

Clayton Kershaw.

1751
01:07:32,160 --> 01:07:33,730
ALL: on! (LAUGH)

1752
01:07:33,800 --> 01:07:35,609
Amy, he's great.

1753
01:07:35,680 --> 01:07:37,728
LISA: Yeah, where
did you find him?

1754

(STAMMERS) Work.

1755
01:07:38,960 --> 01:07:42,043
Well, you two are
really cute together.

1756
01:07:42,160 --> 01:07:44,606
You two would have
the most perfect babies.

1757
01:07:44,680 --> 01:07:46,842
I could just eat you up.
You know'?

1758
01:07:46,920 --> 01:07:48,968
Yeah, it seems a little early
for this kind of talk.

1759
01:07:49,040 --> 01:07:50,087
It's not.

1760
01:07:50,160 --> 01:07:51,286
If anything,
it's late.

1761
01:07:51,360 --> 01:07:55,524
My life did not begin
until I had kids.

1762
01:07:55,600 --> 01:07:57,045
Your life has not begun.

1763
01:07:57,120 --> 01:08:00,408
Yeah, you know, I'm pretty
happy right now, so...

1764
01:08:00,480 --> 01:08:02,209
LISA: Aaron, do you
want a family?

1765
01:08:02,560 --> 01:08:04,244
Um... Yeah.

1766
01:08:04,320 --> 01:08:05,401
I think I'd like
to have two kids

1767
01:08:05,480 --> 01:08:07,244
by the time I'm
40 at least, right?

1768
01:08:07,320 --> 01:08:08,287
Yeah.
Oh, that's great.

1769
01:08:08,360 --> 01:08:10,249
Two is tight.
It's tight.

1770
01:08:10,320 --> 01:08:11,924
WENDY: If I were you,
I would start thinking

1771
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:13,604
about having them
as soon as possible.

1772
01:08:13,680 --> 01:08:15,409
Just breathe. Just breathe.
It's fine.

1773
01:08:15,480 --> 01:08:16,686
He wants to have kids. Amy.

1774
01:08:16,760 --> 01:08:18,091
Right now. People
talk about that.

1775
01:08:18,160 --> 01:08:19,321
Not really.
It's fine.

1776
01:08:19,400 --> 01:08:20,606
I don't know anyone
that talks about that.

1777
01:08:20,680 --> 01:08:22,284
He's great.
It's normal.

1778
01:08:22,360 --> 01:08:23,805
I think Aaron's great.
I really like him.

1779
01:08:23,880 --> 01:08:25,882
Can you tell the members of
Heaven's Gate in there to relax?

1780
01:08:25,960 --> 01:08:27,564
No, he's too nice.
He's not too nice.

1781
01:08:27,640 --> 01:08:29,244
Yes, he is. He's too nice for me.
You know it.

1782
01:08:29,320 --> 01:08:30,446
No, Amy.

1783
01:08:30,520 --> 01:08:31,965
He's the perfect amount
of nice that you deserve.

1784
01:08:32,040 --> 01:08:34,088
Yeah, but there's deal-breakers
across the hoard with him.

1785
01:08:34,160 --> 01:08:36,447
Like the sex is good.
It's really good.

1786
01:08:36,520 --> 01:08:39,091
It's great, but it's not the
best I've ever had. You know?

1787
01:08:39,880 --> 01:08:42,690
Right. You don't want
best-sex-that-yowve- ever-had guy.

1788
01:08:42,760 --> 01:08:45,411
No, you wanna stay with the
best-yowve-ever-had guy.

1789
01:08:45,480 --> 01:08:46,891
No, you don't.
That's a creepy guy.

1790
01:08:46,960 --> 01:08:47,961
You don't wanna
be with that guy.

1791
01:08:48,040 --> 01:08:50,805
Best-sex-that-yowve-
ever-had guy is in jail.

1792
01:08:50,880 --> 01:08:52,041
You know what I mean?

1793
01:08:52,120 --> 01:08:53,246
Yeah.

1794
01:08:53,320 --> 01:08:55,209
But I've been thinking about
maybe reaching outto him.

1795
01:08:55,280 --> 01:08:56,281
(LAUGHS) Stop.

1796
01:08:56,400 --> 01:08:58,129
Amy, breathe. It's fine.
He's great.

1797
01:08:58,200 --> 01:08:59,201
You're ridiculous.

1798
01:08:59,320 --> 01:09:00,401
ALLISTER: Mother.
I'm not ready for.“

1799
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:02,764
lfl kiss the belly
hard enough,

1800
01:09:02,840 --> 01:09:04,444
will the baby feel it?

1801
01:09:06,040 --> 01:09:07,405
You wanna try?

1802
01:09:09,240 --> 01:09:11,561
I think that the
baby did feel it.

1803
01:09:14,920 --> 01:09:15,921
No.

1804
01:09:16,920 --> 01:09:18,001
Kim's great, man.

1805
01:09:18,080 --> 01:09:19,650
Oh, yeah. She's really awesome.

1806
01:09:19,720 --> 01:09:20,846
Kim's the best.

1807
01:09:20,920 --> 01:09:22,331
I'm glad I finally
got to meet her.

1808
01:09:22,400 --> 01:09:25,722
Yeah, and Amy's great,
too, by the way.

1809
01:09:26,080 --> 01:09:28,003
I just love her.

1810
01:09:28,080 --> 01:09:29,844
But keep her away
from those pro athletes.

1811
01:09:29,920 --> 01:09:31,684
You know what I mean?
(LAUGHING)

1812
01:09:31,760 --> 01:09:33,364
Wait, what does
that mean?

1813
01:09:33,560 --> 01:09:34,846
Um...

1814
01:09:34,920 --> 01:09:36,649
<i>No. “was a 'yoke.</i>

1815
01:09:36,720 --> 01:09:38,529
Like, that she'd
sleep with them.

1816
01:09:38,600 --> 01:09:40,090
I don't get
the joke angle.

1817
01:09:41,120 --> 01:09:43,168
No, not that
she would, but...

1818
01:09:43,280 --> 01:09:45,681
Those are the kinds
of jokes she tells.

1819
01:09:45,760 --> 01:09:48,286
Like, "I'm loose! I'm a
whore!" or whatever.

1820
01:09:48,360 --> 01:09:49,361
That's my
girlfriend.

1821
01:09:49,440 --> 01:09:51,966
No! I know.
It's not myjoke.

1822
01:09:52,080 --> 01:09:53,844
Those are the kind
of jokes she tells,

1823
01:09:53,960 --> 01:09:56,088
which I'm not
for at all.

1824
01:09:56,160 --> 01:09:58,049
I'm always like, "Don't
tell these kinds of jokes."

1825
01:09:58,120 --> 01:09:59,884
And then she does,
and I'm like,

1826
01:09:59,960 --> 01:10:01,610
"There she
goes again."

1827
01:10:01,680 --> 01:10:03,045
But I'm
just like...

1828
01:10:03,120 --> 01:10:04,121
Just forget
I said this.

1829
01:10:04,200 --> 01:10:05,690
Just drag that
one to the trash

1830
01:10:05,760 --> 01:10:08,206
and empty
the trash.

1831
01:10:14,280 --> 01:10:16,328
The game is “Skeletons
in the Closet."

1832
01:10:16,440 --> 01:10:17,441
Okay.

1833
01:10:17,520 --> 01:10:19,090
We all have
to admit things

1834
01:10:19,160 --> 01:10:21,083
we've never
told anyone before.

1835
01:10:21,160 --> 01:10:22,400
KAT: No! Wendy!

1836
01:10:22,480 --> 01:10:23,845
Yes!
Yes, we have to.

1837
01:10:24,480 --> 01:10:26,244
WENDY: We have to do it.
KAT: Okay, okay.

1838
01:10:26,320 --> 01:10:29,722
Sometimes, after
Kyle falls asleep,

1839
01:10:29,800 --> 01:10:31,484
I get up and eat Skinny
Cow ice cream pops.

1840
01:10:31,560 --> 01:10:32,561
No!

1841
01:10:32,640 --> 01:10:34,529
LISA: No, you don't.
You should be asleep!

1842
01:10:34,600 --> 01:10:37,080
I know! Sometimes
I have the whole box.

1843
01:10:37,160 --> 01:10:38,241
LISA; What?

1844
01:10:38,320 --> 01:10:41,961
That's like a whole regular-size ice
cream if you eat the whole box.

1845
01:10:42,040 --> 01:10:44,088
I know.
Your turn.

1846
01:10:44,160 --> 01:10:45,924
Okay. Um...

1847
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:50,449
Last week, I let my
six-year-old watch Glee.

01:10:50,520 --> 01:10:51,760
(ALL GASP)
LISA: I know. I know.

1849
01:10:51,840 --> 01:10:52,966
Too SOON!

01:10:53,040 --> 01:10:54,405
KIM: That show is very racy.

1851
01:10:54,520 --> 01:10:57,251
There were some homosexual undertones.
I will say that.

1852
01:10:57,320 --> 01:10:59,971
There were two girls
kissing in this episode.

1853
01:11:00,040 --> 01:11:02,805
And I haven't even explained
to them what gay people are.

1854
01:11:03,120 --> 01:11:04,326
Uh, they're people.

1855
01:11:04,720 --> 01:11:07,690
Okay, okay.
Amy, your turn.

1856
01:11:07,880 --> 01:11:09,086
Um...

1857
01:11:09,200 --> 01:11:11,931
I don't know how I'm gonna follow these.
They were so good.

1858
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:13,490
You guys are
really brave.

1859
01:11:14,160 --> 01:11:15,207
Thanks for trusting.

1860
01:11:15,840 --> 01:11:16,921
Um...

1861
01:11:17,040 --> 01:11:20,328
Onetime, I had
sex with this guy,

1862
01:11:20,400 --> 01:11:22,004
and we couldn't
find the condom.

1863
01:11:22,080 --> 01:11:26,927
So, three days later, I found out
it was attached to my cervix.

1864
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:29,128
It had been kind of
pounded up there.

1865
01:11:29,720 --> 01:11:32,451
And so I googled
what do I do, right'?

1866
01:11:32,520 --> 01:11:35,205
So it said just
kind of bear down.

1867
01:11:36,040 --> 01:11:37,201
Just fish it out.

1868
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:39,968
Make your finger a hook.

1869
01:11:40,680 --> 01:11:42,409
So I just hooked
my finger like this,

1870
01:11:42,480 --> 01:11:44,244
and then just
kind of beared down,

1871
01:11:44,360 --> 01:11:46,408
and just got it
out of there.

1872
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:56,766
I let Tim and his brothers tag
team me on Christmas morning.

1873
01:11:57,120 --> 01:11:59,885
And you know what?
It was wonderful.

1874
01:12:02,360 --> 01:12:03,725
I like her.

I wasn't nicer

to The Real
Housewives of Hell.

1883
01:12:24,880 --> 01:12:27,486
No, it's fine. It's fine.
It's not about that.

1884
01:12:27,560 --> 01:12:28,891
What's up?

1885
01:12:29,240 --> 01:12:30,241
<i>Um...</i>

1886
01:12:31,080 --> 01:12:33,321
<i>Dad died.</i>

1887
01:12:33,400 --> 01:12:37,166
<i>He was hoarding his medication
and his heart gave out.</i>

1888
01:12:40,320 --> 01:12:41,401
<i>Amy'?</i>

1889
01:12:43,400 --> 01:12:44,925
<i>Are you there?</i>

A nickel? A ruble?

1891
01:12:51,760 --> 01:12:54,286
Crowdfund this.
Come on, help me out.

(TALKING INDISTINCTLY)

1893
01:13:02,680 --> 01:13:03,727
Thank you.

1894
01:13:20,680 --> 01:13:23,490
(STAMMERING)
I had a black boyfriend once.

1895
01:13:24,240 --> 01:13:26,288
Your mother
must be proud.

1896
01:13:28,720 --> 01:13:30,245
Yep.

1897
01:13:31,640 --> 01:13:33,722
And I'd
do it again.

AMY: (CLEARS THROAT)
Hello.

1899
01:13:37,520 --> 01:13:39,488
Thank you
for coming.

1900
01:13:43,200 --> 01:13:45,851
Gordon David Townsend.

1901
01:13:47,840 --> 01:13:50,207
Not that great of a guy.

1902
01:13:51,400 --> 01:13:53,801
He was
kind of racist,

1903
01:13:54,600 --> 01:13:57,080
and homophobic.

1904
01:13:57,200 --> 01:13:59,009
He was a drunk.

1905
01:14:01,360 --> 01:14:03,442
He was a drunk.

1906
01:14:03,520 --> 01:14:04,806
He once
apologized to me

1907
01:14:04,880 --> 01:14:06,723
for missing a
volleyball game

1908
01:14:06,800 --> 01:14:08,564
that he was at.

1909
01:14:09,440 --> 01:14:13,126
He had made signs
with my name on them.

1910
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:17,240
When I was 11,

1911
01:14:17,320 --> 01:14:19,800
this kid,
Brandon Lipinsky...

1912
01:14:19,880 --> 01:14:20,881
Remember Brandon?

1913
01:14:20,960 --> 01:14:22,610
He stole my bike.

1914
01:14:24,360 --> 01:14:25,885
And he maybe was
just borrowing it,

1915
01:14:25,960 --> 01:14:27,200
but our dad
went over there

1916
01:14:27,280 --> 01:14:29,408
and beat the shit
out of Brandon's dad,

1917
01:14:29,480 --> 01:14:31,164
and his grandpa,

1918
01:14:31,240 --> 01:14:32,890
and Brandon.

1919
01:14:32,960 --> 01:14:33,961
(ALL CHUCKLING)

1920
01:14:37,040 --> 01:14:38,405
I bet he
personally offended

1921
01:14:38,480 --> 01:14:40,130
everyone here.
Right?

1922
01:14:40,200 --> 01:14:42,726
Raise your hand if our
dad ever offended you.

1923
01:14:47,480 --> 01:14:49,244
(LAUGHING)

1924
01:14:49,320 --> 01:14:50,845
Yeah.

1925
01:14:50,920 --> 01:14:53,241
He was an asshole.

1926
01:14:53,320 --> 01:14:54,845
When I asked him
to tell me the story

1927
01:14:54,920 --> 01:14:56,729
of how he proposed
to our mom,

1928
01:14:57,600 --> 01:14:58,886
his response was

1929
01:14:59,560 --> 01:15:01,005
"who?"

1930
01:15:01,080 --> 01:15:02,081
(ALL CHUCKLE)

1931
01:15:03,800 --> 01:15:05,086
I know he was joking,

1932
01:15:05,160 --> 01:15:07,561
he loved her
a lot. But...

1933
01:15:14,480 --> 01:15:18,485
He was really sick
for a really long time.

1934
01:15:20,480 --> 01:15:22,164
Which isn't fair

1935
01:15:22,960 --> 01:15:24,200
because I don't
think anyone else

1936
01:15:24,280 --> 01:15:27,727
was more alive than him
when he was younger.

1937
01:15:30,200 --> 01:15:33,682
He thought it was payback.
He thought it was karma.

1938
01:15:33,760 --> 01:15:35,000
And that's why
he got sick,

1939
01:15:35,080 --> 01:15:36,445
but I don't think so.

1940
01:15:39,120 --> 01:15:41,964
I think he was
the greatest dad.

1941
01:15:42,040 --> 01:15:45,931
He always made me
feel loved and important.

1942
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:49,571
I know he fucked up.
(SHUDDERS)

1943
01:15:49,640 --> 01:15:52,291
I know he probably
hurt everyone here.

1944
01:15:53,440 --> 01:15:56,091
But raise your hand if he was
one of your favorite people.

1945
01:16:01,320 --> 01:16:03,766
He was my
favorite person.

1946
01:16:11,320 --> 01:16:12,651
Thank you.

1947
01:16:20,720 --> 01:16:22,290
You all right'?

1948
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:28,322
This makes me wish they'd
found my father's remains.

1949
01:16:40,120 --> 01:16:41,121
Hey.

1950
01:16:48,800 --> 01:16:51,406
Mother, can we go
to La Poubelle now?

1951
01:16:51,480 --> 01:16:52,641
Yeah. Sure, honey.

1952
01:16:52,720 --> 01:16:54,529
How about a
piece of pizza'?

1953
01:16:54,600 --> 01:16:57,080
So Mom doesn't have to take
you to a French restaurant.

1954
01:16:57,160 --> 01:16:58,525
Pizza has
gluten in it.

1955
01:16:58,600 --> 01:16:59,761
Who gives a shit?

1956
01:16:59,840 --> 01:17:02,366
I'm sorry. I'm just kidding.
We're just...

1957
01:17:02,560 --> 01:17:04,927
I'll putAllister
in the car.

1958
01:17:08,280 --> 01:17:10,169

one second?

1959
01:17:10,240 --> 01:17:11,924
I'm joking-

1960
01:17:13,200 --> 01:17:14,725
I'm not in the
mood today.

1961
01:17:14,800 --> 01:17:17,371
I'm not in the mood
for the jokes today.

1962
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:19,161
Thoughtyowd be
in a great mood.

1963
01:17:19,280 --> 01:17:21,647
You don't have to pay for
Dad's nursing home anymore.

1964
01:17:23,080 --> 01:17:24,320
What are you doing?

1965
01:17:24,400 --> 01:17:25,401
What?

1966
01:17:25,480 --> 01:17:26,925
Don't push me
away today.

1967
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:28,445
I'm pushing
you away?

1968
01:17:28,520 --> 01:17:30,204
YES.

1969
01:17:30,280 --> 01:17:33,807
You've been running away from
this fucking family forever.

1970
01:17:33,880 --> 01:17:35,882
Amy, lam not
a crazy person

1971
01:17:35,960 --> 01:17:37,007
because I got married,

1972
01:17:37,080 --> 01:17:38,764
and got pregnant
with a child.

1973
01:17:38,880 --> 01:17:40,211
That's what people do.

1974
01:17:40,280 --> 01:17:42,442
Why are you even here?
You didn't even like him.

1975
01:17:42,520 --> 01:17:43,601
I did everything.

1976
01:17:43,720 --> 01:17:46,200
You don't get to pretend
today like you gave a fuck.

1977
01:17:46,280 --> 01:17:48,442
I think that's
enough for today, Amy.

1978
01:17:48,520 --> 01:17:50,045
We ought to go.

1979
01:17:53,280 --> 01:17:55,248
Hey. Hey.

1980
01:17:56,520 --> 01:17:57,567
YOU Okay?

1981
01:17:57,640 --> 01:17:58,766
Yeah, I'm good.

1982
01:17:58,840 --> 01:17:59,887
You ready to go?

1983
01:17:59,960 --> 01:18:01,007
Yeah, let's go.

1984
01:18:01,080 --> 01:18:03,924
I just want you to know,
I really care about you, okay'?

1985
01:18:04,760 --> 01:18:06,603
And I love you.
Thank you.

1986
01:18:06,680 --> 01:18:08,045
What?

1987
01:18:08,160 --> 01:18:10,003
Are you seriously
saying that to me today?

1988
01:18:10,120 --> 01:18:11,690
You're gonna say
that to me, seriously,

1989
01:18:11,760 --> 01:18:13,205
for the first time
right now?

1990
01:18:13,280 --> 01:18:16,204
They're putting dirt on
my dad's body behind you.

1991
01:18:16,280 --> 01:18:19,011
Today is the day
you say that? Let's go.

1992
01:18:19,680 --> 01:18:20,886
Is that bad?
Yes, that's bad.

1993
01:18:20,960 --> 01:18:22,121
Bad timing.

1994
01:18:22,200 --> 01:18:23,964
Sorry about
that. Sorry.

1995
01:18:24,040 --> 01:18:25,201
Is this us?

1996
01:18:25,280 --> 01:18:26,406
We're way
down there.

1997
01:18:27,960 --> 01:18:29,007
Is this us?

1998
01:18:29,080 --> 01:18:30,445
No.

1999
01:18:31,880 --> 01:18:32,927
Can he pull up?

2000
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:34,331
Do we have his number?
Is this us?

2001
01:18:34,400 --> 01:18:36,164
Sorry about
that. Sorry.

2002
01:19:03,720 --> 01:19:05,245
(sum-nus)

2003
01:19:12,120 --> 01:19:13,201
Hey.

2004
01:19:13,280 --> 01:19:15,203
How's it going,
sweetheart?

2005
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:17,968
I'm getting by.
Mmm-hmm.

2006
01:19:18,040 --> 01:19:20,805
Thank you for coming the other day.
That was really nice.

2007
01:19:20,880 --> 01:19:22,723
I can't believe
he's gone.

2008
01:19:22,800 --> 01:19:23,926
I'm literally
just sitting here

2009
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:25,126
waiting for him to call.

2010
01:19:25,200 --> 01:19:28,283
It feels like
a dream or something.

2011
01:19:28,360 --> 01:19:29,930
Are we still
talking about this?

2012
01:19:31,800 --> 01:19:33,609
That was
eight days ago.

2013
01:19:34,320 --> 01:19:35,367
I'm over it.

2014
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:38,367
It was hard,
but I'm over it.

2015
01:19:38,440 --> 01:19:39,566
All right.

2016
01:19:39,640 --> 01:19:41,961
Best way to grieve...

2017
01:19:42,040 --> 01:19:43,929
Don't do it.

2018
01:19:45,160 --> 01:19:46,127
Don't.

2019
01:19:46,200 --> 01:19:47,247
Do not grieve?
No.

2020
01:19:48,400 --> 01:19:50,289
I've got good
news for you.

2021
01:19:50,360 --> 01:19:54,046
You know that story, that Mr.
Doctor Boring Sports Guy?

2022
01:19:54,120 --> 01:19:55,326
Well, I cut it.

2023
01:19:55,400 --> 01:19:57,767
I know you weren't in love
with that piece anyway.

2024
01:19:57,840 --> 01:19:59,763
No, no, no. I was very
in love with that.

2025
01:19:59,840 --> 01:20:01,126
I love that piece.

2026
01:20:01,200 --> 01:20:02,725
There's nothing happening.
There's no tension.

2027
01:20:02,800 --> 01:20:05,201
There's no sex appeal.
He's a bore.

2028
01:20:05,320 --> 01:20:08,722
Did you see the pictures?
We did a photo shoot.

2029
01:20:08,800 --> 01:20:09,847
Look at him.

2030
01:20:09,920 --> 01:20:13,163
Personally, I don't
like his odd bird face,

2031
01:20:13,240 --> 01:20:14,321
but we tried
everything.

2032
01:20:14,400 --> 01:20:15,561
We tried a ball.

2033
01:20:15,640 --> 01:20:16,641
He's supposed to
be a sports guy.

2034
01:20:16,720 --> 01:20:18,051
I don't think he'd ever
touched a ball before.

2035
01:20:18,120 --> 01:20:19,360
Not that kind, anyway.

2036
01:20:19,440 --> 01:20:21,010
And there he is. Look
at him standing there,

2037
01:20:21,080 --> 01:20:22,161
stiff as a scarecrow.

2038
01:20:22,240 --> 01:20:23,571
These guys,
they're hot, right'?

2039
01:20:24,120 --> 01:20:26,646
We even got him wet!
Would you fuck that?

2040
01:20:26,720 --> 01:20:27,767
Sure.

2041
01:20:27,840 --> 01:20:29,842
You would? I wouldn't
fuck that with your dick.

2042
01:20:29,920 --> 01:20:31,490
No. We decided
to go with

2043
01:20:31,560 --> 01:20:33,449
"Ugliest Celebrity
Kids Under 6."

2044
01:20:33,520 --> 01:20:35,284
Let's get this
done, Amy.

2045
01:20:35,360 --> 01:20:37,601
Orwe are not
talking promotion.

2046
01:20:37,680 --> 01:20:39,011
MMm-hmm.
Good girl.

2047
01:20:44,160 --> 01:20:45,366
Almost ready?

2048
01:20:45,440 --> 01:20:46,930
AMY: Yeah,
I need two seconds.

2049
01:20:47,480 --> 01:20:49,721
How you feeling about
Amar'e's surgery tomorrow?

2050
01:20:49,800 --> 01:20:51,325
I don't feel any
pressure at all, you know?

2051
01:20:51,400 --> 01:20:53,323
If it doesn't work, it's
just the end of his career.

2052
01:20:53,400 --> 01:20:55,448
But (CLICKS TONGUE)
I feel fine.

2053
01:20:56,440 --> 01:20:57,680
I can't breathe in this.

2054
01:20:57,760 --> 01:20:58,807

talk about it?

2222
01:27:21,400 --> 01:27:22,640
You want to get into it? Yes!

2223
01:27:22,720 --> 01:27:24,085
Let's get into all of it right now.
Yes, please.

2224
01:27:24,160 --> 01:27:25,400
Okay, let's do it.
Okay.

2225
01:27:25,480 --> 01:27:26,527
I'll start.

2226
01:27:26,600 --> 01:27:28,170
You go down
on me too much.

2227
01:27:28,480 --> 01:27:29,527
What?
Yeah.

2228
01:27:29,600 --> 01:27:30,567
It's selfish.

2229
01:27:30,680 --> 01:27:32,523
No, it is actually selfish,
because you act...

2230
01:27:32,640 --> 01:27:33,766
Don't look
like I'm crazy.

2231
01:27:33,840 --> 01:27:35,285
You act like
it's for me,

2232
01:27:35,360 --> 01:27:37,522
but really, it's just to
show how great you are.

2233
01:27:37,600 --> 01:27:39,125
Like, you're always
helping people.

2234
01:27:39,200 --> 01:27:40,725
So I shouldn't go
down on you as much?

2235
01:27:40,800 --> 01:27:42,086
Don't try and
spin this as a way

2236
01:27:42,160 --> 01:27:43,161
to not go down
on me as much.

2237
01:27:43,240 --> 01:27:44,446
That's ridiculous.

2238
01:27:44,520 --> 01:27:46,568
Of course, I want you to
go down on me that much.

2239
01:27:46,640 --> 01:27:47,766
So take it
down a notch?

2240
01:27:47,840 --> 01:27:49,330
No, keep going
down on me.

2241
01:27:49,400 --> 01:27:51,482
Forget this whole part
of the argument, okay'?

2242
01:27:51,560 --> 01:27:52,686
Forget that.

2243
01:27:55,400 --> 01:27:57,050
I'm so glad
you apologized.

2244
01:27:57,120 --> 01:27:58,451
I didn't apologize!

2245
01:27:59,520 --> 01:28:00,567
Wow!

2246
01:28:00,640 --> 01:28:01,687
I did not
apologize.

2247
01:28:01,760 --> 01:28:03,444
Are you serious
right now?

2248
01:28:03,520 --> 01:28:05,568
I've been through
a lot this year,

2249
01:28:05,640 --> 01:28:08,291
and of course I'm gonna have
some ups and downs,

2250
01:28:08,360 --> 01:28:10,488
but that's why I need
to stop and then say,

2251
01:28:10,560 --> 01:28:11,971
"Am I gonnajust
follow the river

2252
01:28:12,040 --> 01:28:13,690
"or am I gonna make
decisions in my..."

2253
01:28:13,760 --> 01:28:15,000
You're sleeping!

2254
01:28:15,920 --> 01:28:17,206
You were just asleep.

2255
01:28:17,280 --> 01:28:19,044
No, lwasn't.
Okay, good.

2256
01:28:19,120 --> 01:28:21,088
Because I am not even close to done.
Okay.

2257
01:28:21,160 --> 01:28:23,447
I have a lot of thoughts and I'm
thinking very clearly right now.

2258
01:28:23,520 --> 01:28:26,763
I'm so glad that I feel comfortable
enough with you to talk like this.

2259
01:28:26,840 --> 01:28:28,251
This is the time
when you have to look

2260
01:28:28,320 --> 01:28:29,401
at yourself and say...
(SNORING)

2261
01:28:29,480 --> 01:28:30,925
"Am I living the
best life I could?"

2262
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:32,729
"Am I the best
version of myself

2263
01:28:32,800 --> 01:28:34,370
"that I could
possibly be?"

2264
01:28:34,440 --> 01:28:36,169
That's why I need
to stop and then say,

2265
01:28:36,240 --> 01:28:38,891
"Am I gonna just follow the
river or am I gonna..."

2266
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:40,684
Wake up, Aaron!

2267
01:28:40,760 --> 01:28:42,524
You're totally sleeping!
Mmm-mm.

2268
01:28:42,600 --> 01:28:43,647
You said we were
gonna stay up

2269
01:28:43,720 --> 01:28:45,449
until we figure it out,
like your parents.

2270
01:28:45,520 --> 01:28:46,646
I'm listening.

2271
01:28:46,720 --> 01:28:48,051
AMY: What did I just say?

2272
01:28:48,120 --> 01:28:49,929
You said, "Wake up."

2273
01:29:03,600 --> 01:29:05,250
Amar'e.
What's up, Doc'?

2274
01:29:05,400 --> 01:29:06,970
How you feeling, buddy? Good.

2275
01:29:06,960 --> 01:29:08,564
You ready to do this? Yeah.

2276
01:29:08,640 --> 01:29:09,880
We're gonna do this.
It's gonna be great.

2277
01:29:09,960 --> 01:29:10,961
AWGSOMG.

2278
01:29:11,040 --> 01:29:12,280
You met Rachel?
Yes.

2279
01:29:12,360 --> 01:29:13,964
We've been acquainted.

2280
01:29:14,080 --> 01:29:15,809
Okay. What do we have here?

2281
01:29:15,880 --> 01:29:18,167
This is just a little more
sedative to relax you.

2282
01:29:18,240 --> 01:29:19,401
Hey, the good stuff.

2283
01:29:19,480 --> 01:29:20,686
Yeah.

2284
01:29:20,760 --> 01:29:22,091
Okay. Oh, whoa!

2285
01:29:22,680 --> 01:29:23,920
All right, buddy.

2286
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:27,607
Okay. So, we're gonna be replacing
your cruciate ligament.

2287
01:29:28,080 --> 01:29:29,081
And, um...

2288
01:29:30,560 --> 01:29:33,530
Uh, do you want a coffee?
Hey, could we get a coffee?

2289
01:29:33,600 --> 01:29:35,284
I can't. I'm not supposed
to drink before...

2290
01:29:35,360 --> 01:29:36,441
Right. Don't
worry about it.

2291
01:29:36,520 --> 01:29:38,807
Just one coffee,
for me. Um...

2292
01:29:39,480 --> 01:29:40,606
Are you okay, Doc?

2293
01:29:40,680 --> 01:29:43,365
Me? I'm great.
I'm great. Yeah.

2294
01:29:43,480 --> 01:29:44,925
Me and Amy got into
a little bit of an argument,

2295
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:47,287
but I think
I'm doing okay.

2296
01:29:47,400 --> 01:29:49,084
Yeah, this is gonna
go really well.

2297
01:29:49,160 --> 01:29:51,128
She really lit
into me last night.

2298
01:29:51,600 --> 01:29:53,807
Wow.
AARON: Like really...

2299
01:29:53,880 --> 01:29:55,644
A side of her I've
never seen before.

2300
01:29:56,640 --> 01:29:57,926
It got dark, fast.

2301
01:29:58,000 --> 01:29:59,161
It really fucked me up.

2302
01:29:59,240 --> 01:30:00,241
Are you sure
you're okay?

2303
01:30:00,320 --> 01:30:01,526
AARON: I'm good' I'm good.

2304
01:30:01,600 --> 01:30:02,601
We're gonna
get this going.

2305
01:30:02,680 --> 01:30:04,330
AMAR'E: Okay. Perfect.

2306
01:30:05,160 --> 01:30:06,207
(CLATTERING)

2307
01:30:06,280 --> 01:30:10,251
I'm gonna mark the knee that we're
gonna do the surgery on, all right?

2308
01:30:10,320 --> 01:30:11,401
Doc, this is the
wrong knee.

2309
01:30:11,480 --> 01:30:13,209
I'm marking this as
not the knee to do.

2310
01:30:13,280 --> 01:30:16,807
This is not the knee.

2311
01:30:16,880 --> 01:30:18,370
Not this knee.

2312
01:30:19,720 --> 01:30:20,721
Not this knee.

2313
01:30:20,800 --> 01:30:21,926
Are you sure
you're okay, Doc?

2314
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:23,240
Amar'e, I'm great.

2315
01:30:23,320 --> 01:30:26,688
This is gonna go great. This is the
bad boy we're gonna split open.

2316
01:30:26,760 --> 01:30:28,250
You know what?
This is a bad idea.

2317
01:30:29,000 --> 01:30:31,890
Amar'e, you're nervous.
Everyone gets nervous.

2318
01:30:31,960 --> 01:30:33,041
I don't think
you get it, Doc.

2319
01:30:33,120 --> 01:30:34,121
We need to
reschedule this.

2320
01:30:34,240 --> 01:30:35,287
AARON: No, no, no.

2321
01:30:35,360 --> 01:30:37,249
We're not doing that. I'm gonna
get you back out on the court.

2322
01:30:37,320 --> 01:30:38,651
We gotta get you
back out on the court.

2323
01:30:38,720 --> 01:30:39,846
I wanna see you
play. Okay?

2324
01:30:39,960 --> 01:30:41,724
I'm here for you, okay?

2325
01:30:41,800 --> 01:30:43,564
You're nervous,
I'm nervous.

2326
01:30:43,640 --> 01:30:46,166
Amy was acting like
a psycho last night.

2327
01:30:46,240 --> 01:30:47,810
I don't know what I did.

2328
01:30:48,200 --> 01:30:51,249
I really,
really like her,

2329
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:54,128
but she's like
a fucking demon.

2330
01:30:55,080 --> 01:30:57,321
She's like the
fucking Exorcist.

2331
01:30:57,400 --> 01:31:00,961
I said, "You gotta let me go to sleep.
I have a surgery."

2332
01:31:01,040 --> 01:31:02,201
And you know what she said?
She said,

2333
01:31:02,280 --> 01:31:03,327
(MIMICKING DEMONIC VOICE)
"NO!"

2334
01:31:03,400 --> 01:31:04,925
I'm taking a rain check.
No, no, no.

2335
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:06,286
I'm out of here.
No, no, no.

2336
01:31:07,040 --> 01:31:08,610
(SPITTING)
(HEART MONITOR FLATLINES)

2337
01:31:08,680 --> 01:31:10,284
Hey, Amar'e.

2338
01:31:10,400 --> 01:31:12,004
Mr. Stoudemire,
where are you going?

2339
01:31:12,080 --> 01:31:14,367
I've gotta get out of here.
I've gotta get out of here.

2340
01:31:16,240 --> 01:31:18,004
RACHEL: Amar'e!
Watch your head.

2341
01:31:18,720 --> 01:31:19,721
Oh!
(THUDDING)

2342
01:31:19,800 --> 01:31:21,370
(METALLIC CLATTERING)
Oh, Shit!

2343
01:31:24,200 --> 01:31:25,884
(DOOR OPENS)

2344
01:31:29,680 --> 01:31:30,886
Hey.
AARON: Hey.

2345
01:31:30,960 --> 01:31:32,166
How'd it go'?

2346
01:31:33,720 --> 01:31:35,927
Have you just been watching
TV and smoking pot all day?

2347
01:31:36,280 --> 01:31:40,046
No. I got up and
had some cereal.

2348
01:31:40,120 --> 01:31:41,246
At some point.

2349
01:31:44,080 --> 01:31:46,401
They canceled
my surgery today.

2350
01:31:47,400 --> 01:31:49,209
Amar'e didn't feel comfortable
with me performing it

2351
01:31:49,280 --> 01:31:50,850
because I was
too tired,

2352
01:31:50,920 --> 01:31:54,003
so he fled.

2353
01:31:54,080 --> 01:31:56,128
He was on a lot
of anesthesia. He fell.

2354
01:31:57,680 --> 01:31:59,762
And when ltried to help
him, he called me a witch.

2355
01:32:00,640 --> 01:32:01,766
Is he okay?

2356
01:32:03,280 --> 01:32:06,363
You know, and itwas because
of all this shit last night.

2357
01:32:06,440 --> 01:32:08,044
Which was crazy.

2358
01:32:08,440 --> 01:32:09,851
<i>“Was bad.</i>

2359
01:32:09,960 --> 01:32:11,121
Yeah.

2360
01:32:13,640 --> 01:32:15,369
You know, I've been
thinking about all that

2361
01:32:15,440 --> 01:32:17,886
and I was walking
over here,

2362
01:32:19,360 --> 01:32:21,931
and I was just thinking, maybe...
(CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY)

2363
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:23,843
Can I say something?

2364
01:32:24,960 --> 01:32:28,601
(STAMMERS) It does bother
me that you smoke pot,

2365
01:32:28,680 --> 01:32:30,569
and that you
drink a lot,

2366
01:32:30,640 --> 01:32:33,246
and I do care that you
slept with a lot of guys.

2367
01:32:33,320 --> 01:32:34,890
It makes me feel
unsafe or something.

2368
01:32:34,960 --> 01:32:36,724
Okay, yeah.

2369
01:32:36,800 --> 01:32:39,371
Yeah, you should be with a
girl who you feel safe with.

2370
01:32:39,440 --> 01:32:41,920
That's not what I'm saying.
That's not what I'm saying.

2371
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:44,924
Ifs very clear. That's fine.
It's obvious.

2372
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:46,764
You should be with one
of those cheerleaders.

2373
01:32:46,840 --> 01:32:48,285
Amy, that's not
what I'm saying.

2374
01:32:48,360 --> 01:32:49,441
Just go be with
that kind of girl.

2375
01:32:49,520 --> 01:32:52,729
A little Texan with
huge hair and big tits.

2376
01:32:52,800 --> 01:32:53,881
And then, when
you get married,

2377
01:32:53,960 --> 01:32:55,724
she wants to be
more conservative,

2378
01:32:55,840 --> 01:32:58,411
so shejust gets
smaller fake tits put in,

2379
01:32:58,480 --> 01:33:00,847
but they still
look amazing.

2380
01:33:01,200 --> 01:33:02,611
The thing about
cheerleaders is that

2381
01:33:02,720 --> 01:33:04,165
they bring
people together

2382
01:33:04,240 --> 01:33:05,605
and they make
people happy.

2383
01:33:05,680 --> 01:33:08,923
Unlike you and your
friends at your magazine

2384
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:12,766
who sit there and judge
people from afar

2385
01:33:12,840 --> 01:33:15,844
because if you don't try,
then you can't fail.

2386
01:33:15,920 --> 01:33:17,922
That's why you're
threatened by cheerleaders.

2387
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:19,365
That's me.

2388
01:33:19,920 --> 01:33:21,251
