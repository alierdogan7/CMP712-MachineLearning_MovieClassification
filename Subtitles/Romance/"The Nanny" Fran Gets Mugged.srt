1
00:00:05,886 --> 00:00:11,716
I can't tell you how it feels to be loaning
 an original page of Shakespeare's
 notebook to the Metropolitan Museum.

2
00:00:11,716 --> 00:00:14,808
Yes, sir.  It's a piece of history
 and very noble of you to share it.

3
00:00:14,808 --> 00:00:17,891
Makes me look damned important, 
doesn't it?

4
00:00:17,891 --> 00:00:21,870
Shall I have the inseam let
 out of your trousers?

5
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:26,778
Lending this to the fund raiser will
 make us the hit of the social season.

6
00:00:26,778 --> 00:00:30,903
Thank God your uncle croaked
 and left it to you.

7
00:00:31,006 --> 00:00:34,052
I mean, sorry for your loss.

8
00:00:34,052 --> 00:00:37,642
I don't need glasses. / Brighten,
 so help me, if you keep this up,

9
00:00:37,642 --> 00:00:41,388
I am going to drag you to Loeman's and 
make you sit outside of the ladies dressing room

10
00:00:41,388 --> 00:00:45,242
in the husband's chair with 
my purse in your lap.  Huh?

11
00:00:45,242 --> 00:00:47,341
Is there a problem, Miss Fine?

12
00:00:47,341 --> 00:00:49,482
Brighten doesn't want
 to go pick up his glasses.

13
00:00:49,482 --> 00:00:53,116
I can see fine. 
/ Oh, Brighten, don't be so vain.

14
00:00:53,116 --> 00:00:56,021
Meanwhile, these invitations are gorgeous.

15
00:00:56,021 --> 00:00:58,945
Black guy, optional.

16
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:02,353
That's "black tie," Miss Fine.

17
00:01:02,353 --> 00:01:06,315
Oh, well, I was gonna say ...

18
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:11,642
I don't want to wear some stupid 
wire-rimmed, here-comes-Urkel glasses ...

19
00:01:14,642 --> 00:01:17,821
which happen to look 
excellent on you, dad.

20
00:01:17,821 --> 00:01:21,354
Oh, don't make him wear glasses.

21
00:01:21,354 --> 00:01:24,647
He's so short and underdeveloped.

22
00:01:24,647 --> 00:01:27,893
I mean, aren't the braces enough?

23
00:01:28,672 --> 00:01:32,415
I'll holder her down;
 you tie her tube.

24
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:39,012
Brighten, you are going, and that's that. 
/ There, your father has spoken.

25
00:01:39,012 --> 00:01:41,031
But you said he doesn't know
 what he's talking about half the --

26
00:01:41,031 --> 00:01:44,382
No!  This is the other half. 
 Go get dressed.

27
00:01:44,382 --> 00:01:46,270
So, shall I get you the Town car? 
/ Oh, no.

28
00:01:46,270 --> 00:01:48,355
It's such a glorious day, 
I figure we'll just walk.

29
00:01:48,355 --> 00:01:51,544
Walk?  In this city?
 / I'm wearing four-inch heels.

30
00:01:51,544 --> 00:01:56,629
I can step over anything. 
 To me a wine-o is just a speed bump.

31
00:01:56,910 --> 00:01:59,608
Maxwell, we have that meeting 
at the museum. / Oh, yes.

32
00:01:59,608 --> 00:02:03,704
Oh, Miss Fine, while you're out, there's 
a list of errands on my desk.  Would you mind?

33
00:02:03,704 --> 00:02:09,288
Oh, no, not at all.  Although,
 I don't know what we've got a butler for.

34
00:02:10,786 --> 00:02:13,185
"Hamlet of Denmark?"

35
00:02:13,185 --> 00:02:16,405
Why can't he just write
 "a small Danish ham"?

36
00:02:16,778 --> 00:02:22,311
"Montagu's Capulets?"
  Well, is that regular or extra strength?

37
00:02:22,311 --> 00:02:26,186
Oh, I guess it's whatever I want.
  It says here, "as you like it."

38
00:03:21,688 --> 00:03:23,656
Wow!  Everything's 
so clear now.

39
00:03:23,656 --> 00:03:27,029
Uh-huh.  You know, I really love 
the way you look in your glasses.

40
00:03:27,029 --> 00:03:30,369
You've got a whole Bill Hurt
 thing happening.

41
00:03:30,369 --> 00:03:35,220
You know, I'm seeing fine details I've 
never seen before. / Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh.

42
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:37,609
How old are you?

43
00:03:38,230 --> 00:03:41,407
Take those off. 
 You look like Urkel.

44
00:03:46,187 --> 00:03:49,193
Wow!  Look at that thing.

45
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:52,726
Is that real?

46
00:03:52,726 --> 00:03:54,523
You're acting like
 you've never seen one before.

47
00:03:54,523 --> 00:03:57,052
You've got one; 
your father's got one.

48
00:03:57,052 --> 00:04:00,182
Now, put it here. 
 Let me see how heavy it is.

49
00:04:01,595 --> 00:04:04,497
First of all, Rollex has
 two "L's" in it.

50
00:04:04,497 --> 00:04:06,879
Please.  What kind of
 an idiot is gonna pay --

51
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:12,029
oh, 20 bucks?  I'll take one. 
Here, here.  Thanks.

52
00:04:12,029 --> 00:04:15,043
Look at that, somebody left an entire 
bucket of KFC right on the bench.

53
00:04:15,043 --> 00:04:17,788
Oh, people are such pigs.

54
00:04:17,788 --> 00:04:19,787
Oh, it's just the dark meat.

55
00:04:19,787 --> 00:04:24,479
Give me your purse! 
/ Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Oh! 
 Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!

56
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:25,588
Are you okay?

57
00:04:25,588 --> 00:04:27,927
Oh, my God, Brighten,
 we've been mugged.

58
00:04:27,927 --> 00:04:30,155
What do we do? 
/ Ahhhhh!

59
00:04:30,778 --> 00:04:33,612
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

60
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:40,283
Well, at least we've got witnesses. 
 We've got witnesses.

61
00:04:40,505 --> 00:04:46,854
Oy!  Oy!  Oy! / Fran, Fran, Fran,
 let's not worry. I can handle this.

62
00:04:48,684 --> 00:04:50,496
Brighten, get up!

63
00:04:51,862 --> 00:04:54,468
Oh, Brighten, I can't believe
 this happened to us.

64
00:04:54,468 --> 00:04:56,968
I don't know what do. 
 I can't even think straight.

65
00:04:56,968 --> 00:04:59,401
Excuse me.  Where's Bloomingdales?

66
00:04:59,401 --> 00:05:04,603
Oh, well, go over to Lexington,
 down to 59th.

67
00:05:04,603 --> 00:05:08,122
And the frozen yogurt in the cafe 
is not to be missed.

68
00:05:08,122 --> 00:05:11,838
Hum, hum.  I'll tell you,
 if I wasn't just mugged, I'd join you.

69
00:05:11,838 --> 00:05:14,710
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

70
00:05:20,222 --> 00:05:24,185
Thank goodness you're all right. 
All they got was your purse.

71
00:05:24,185 --> 00:05:30,238
Oh, you know, it's just like they say,
 even after it's gone, you can still feel it.

72
00:05:36,589 --> 00:05:39,195
Now I have to replace 
all my credit cards

73
00:05:39,195 --> 00:05:44,806
and that driver's license with that fabulous
 picture where I look just like Jacquelyn Smith.

74
00:05:45,251 --> 00:05:47,913
Oh, man, if I ever see that creep again.

75
00:05:47,913 --> 00:05:52,047
Oh, sweetie, don't go
 calling him a creep.

76
00:05:52,047 --> 00:05:55,225
Deep down inside there's
 goodness in everyone.

77
00:05:55,225 --> 00:05:59,094
Oh, my God.  He's got 
my Cadillac red lipstick.

78
00:05:59,094 --> 00:06:04,641
It's discontinued. 
 I want that creep to fry.

79
00:06:04,862 --> 00:06:09,041
Calm down, Miss Fine. 
 There's plenty of other red lipsticks.

80
00:06:09,041 --> 00:06:11,824
No, never the same. 
 They out outlawed the dye.

81
00:06:11,824 --> 00:06:16,737
Damn Food and Drug Administration. 
 What are they doing in cosmetics?

82
00:06:16,737 --> 00:06:21,984
My mother wore it for 50 years, 
and her kids came out normal.

83
00:06:22,311 --> 00:06:25,681
You see, I knew something
 like this would happen.

84
00:06:25,681 --> 00:06:29,376
Your wide-eyed naivete was bound 
to get you in trouble sooner or later.

85
00:06:29,376 --> 00:06:33,131
Don't call me naive.  
That is so condescending of you.

86
00:06:33,131 --> 00:06:37,466
And I only appear wide-eyed thanks
 to my Maybelline ultra-lash,

87
00:06:37,703 --> 00:06:40,789
which was in my purse.

88
00:06:41,324 --> 00:06:42,881
Oh, that's the police.

89
00:06:42,881 --> 00:06:47,495
The police?  I -- you called the police? 
I asked you not to call the police.

90
00:06:47,495 --> 00:06:51,049
Well, I'm not gonna talk to them,
 and you can't make me.

91
00:06:51,603 --> 00:06:55,258
Did someone here get mugged? 
/ Oh, I'm the victim.

92
00:06:58,469 --> 00:07:01,161
Well, hi.
 / Hi.

93
00:07:01,161 --> 00:07:06,277
I'm Det. Shoenfeld. 
/ Oh, an NYPD Jew.

94
00:07:07,692 --> 00:07:10,954
What were you doing walking through 
the park, a beautiful woman like you?

95
00:07:10,954 --> 00:07:17,356
That is so naive. 
/ I know.  It's my greatest downfall.

96
00:07:17,931 --> 00:07:21,030
I just said the same bloody thing,
 and she nearly bit my head off.

97
00:07:21,030 --> 00:07:24,351
It's all in the delivery, sir.

98
00:07:24,576 --> 00:07:28,757
Ah, detective, shouldn't you be 
filling out some paperwork?

99
00:07:28,757 --> 00:07:31,072
Are you the guy that 
threw up and fainted?

100
00:07:31,072 --> 00:07:33,625
No.  He did.

101
00:07:34,524 --> 00:07:36,394
How you doing, son?  You okay?

102
00:07:36,394 --> 00:07:38,402
Yes, sir.

103
00:07:39,432 --> 00:07:41,115
Did either of you get 
a good look at the guy?

104
00:07:41,115 --> 00:07:43,860
No.  We only saw him for a second. 
 He had a stocking on his head.

105
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:48,255
No Nonsense, sheer and silky, 
misty toupe, sandal foot.

106
00:07:48,724 --> 00:07:53,979
That's it? / No, no. 
 He had a run over his left ear.

107
00:07:54,450 --> 00:07:57,587
Thanks.  That'll give me something 
to go on. / Oh, okay.

108
00:07:57,587 --> 00:08:00,219
Now, make sure you lock your door.
 / Oh, yes, sir.

109
00:08:00,219 --> 00:08:05,695
I gotta go because crime is
 rampant in the streets.

110
00:08:05,695 --> 00:08:10,249
Oh, gee, your wife must feel 
so safe having you around.

111
00:08:10,249 --> 00:08:13,798
I'm not married.  Oy!

112
00:08:19,314 --> 00:08:23,608
Oh, please, would you look at her,
 swooning all over the place?

113
00:08:23,608 --> 00:08:25,523
What?  Just because he wears a badge?

114
00:08:25,523 --> 00:08:29,934
Shall I fetch those little wings
 the stewardess gave you, sir?

115
00:08:30,611 --> 00:08:32,965
They were for Grace. / Really?

116
00:08:32,965 --> 00:08:36,798
Then what are they doing in your
 jewelry box? / Thank you, Niles.

117
00:08:39,099 --> 00:08:44,581
A simple purse snatching turns deadly 
tonight on a very special "Blossom."

118
00:08:46,803 --> 00:08:50,578
Gracie, this is serious.  
Fran hasn't gotten off that couch all day.

119
00:08:50,578 --> 00:08:52,554
I better go talk to her.

120
00:08:52,705 --> 00:08:54,188
Ohhhh!

121
00:08:57,939 --> 00:09:00,381
On second thought, you go.

122
00:09:02,452 --> 00:09:04,363
Fran ... / Ahhhh!
 / Ahhhhh!

123
00:09:04,363 --> 00:09:09,360
Ahhhhh!  What is the matter? 
 I don't know.  You scared me.

124
00:09:09,745 --> 00:09:11,286
Okay.

125
00:09:12,224 --> 00:09:14,585
Okay.  Calm down.  Calm down.

126
00:09:14,585 --> 00:09:17,673
So the man has my address 
and telephone number.

127
00:09:17,673 --> 00:09:21,370
Lots of guys do.  Do they ever call?

128
00:09:23,293 --> 00:09:27,169
Ah, Fran, um, maybe I should 
take Gracie to ballet today.

129
00:09:27,169 --> 00:09:29,414
Good.  Good idea. 
 Yeah, just this once.

130
00:09:29,414 --> 00:09:32,698
Now, kids, don't think just 
because I was mugged,

131
00:09:32,698 --> 00:09:37,494
I'm going to be afraid to face 
the world outside this door or anything.

132
00:09:37,714 --> 00:09:40,850
Go!  Go!  Go!  Stay low to the ground. 
 Serpentine, serpentine.

133
00:09:40,850 --> 00:09:45,778
Ahhh!  Watch out for that guy,
 that scary guy.  Oh, it's you, Niles, get in here.

134
00:09:47,893 --> 00:09:49,978
Did anyone follow you? 
 Did you get the stuff?

135
00:09:49,978 --> 00:09:54,215
Yes.  Hair spray, breath spray,
 and pepper spray.

136
00:09:54,215 --> 00:09:58,862
Let's say we switch the labels
 and give them to Miss Babcock.

137
00:09:59,712 --> 00:10:04,957
Niles, I've been victimized.  
I don't have time to watch you
 torture Miss Babcock.

138
00:10:05,214 --> 00:10:08,091
Take pictures.

139
00:10:08,732 --> 00:10:10,609
Fran? / What?

140
00:10:10,857 --> 00:10:14,268
I feel terrible.  I should have defended 
you yesterday, but I totally wimped out.

141
00:10:14,268 --> 00:10:17,185
Oh, sweetie, sweetie, listen,

142
00:10:17,185 --> 00:10:22,543
all you did was pass out, puke, 
and pee in your pants.

143
00:10:23,512 --> 00:10:27,567
You were in Central Park.
  You fit right in.

144
00:10:30,276 --> 00:10:33,793
Ask yourself, punk, do you feel lucky?

145
00:10:33,793 --> 00:10:39,796
What was all that about? / Oh, the expert
 is teaching Brighten how to repel a man.

146
00:10:42,183 --> 00:10:46,172
Well, if you'll excuse me, sir, 
I'll take your Shakespeare down to the framer.

147
00:10:46,172 --> 00:10:48,192
I thought you already did that, Niles.

148
00:10:48,192 --> 00:10:53,476
But it was right here.  No one's been 
in here except you and me, Cee Cee and --

149
00:10:53,476 --> 00:10:57,093
Miss Fine! / Oh, now, sir, 
you're jumping to conclusions.

150
00:10:57,093 --> 00:11:01,571
Why do you always blame -- 
Miss Fine!

151
00:11:02,368 --> 00:11:04,380
I heard you the first time.

152
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:08,598
Miss Fine, Miss Fine, did you see a very
 ancient document on this desk yesterday morning?

153
00:11:08,598 --> 00:11:12,208
You mean Chita Rivera's resume?

154
00:11:14,455 --> 00:11:17,623
It was my Shakespeare.  It's missing,
 and you were the last one in here.

155
00:11:17,623 --> 00:11:20,889
All right.  Don't panic.  
Let's just retrace our steps.

156
00:11:20,889 --> 00:11:24,327
Now, I came in with that whole
 Brighten eye glasses issue,

157
00:11:24,327 --> 00:11:27,457
and then you said, Miss Fine -- 
oh, no -- that was just now.

158
00:11:27,457 --> 00:11:30,704
Anyway, Cee Cee said something stupid,
 and then you nailed her with that

159
00:11:30,704 --> 00:11:36,309
tube-tying zinger, which 
I'm still laughing about.  Ah-ha!

160
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:38,229
Thank you.

161
00:11:38,229 --> 00:11:41,658
And yatta, yatta, yatta.  You asked me 
to run your errands.  I walked over here

162
00:11:41,658 --> 00:11:47,794
to pick up the list.  "Brown shoe laces, 
foot powder, Earl gray" -- ah-oh.

163
00:11:47,948 --> 00:11:54,301
Ah-oh, what? / Oh, please, tell me
 Macbeth is something you eat with Mcfries.

164
00:11:59,135 --> 00:12:02,560
You took the Shakespeare 
instead of my list?

165
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:04,217
Please tell me it wasn't
 in your purse.

166
00:12:04,217 --> 00:12:05,819
It wasn't in my purse.

167
00:12:05,819 --> 00:12:08,582
Are you lying? 
/ Uh-huh.

168
00:12:09,107 --> 00:12:15,118
I told you to take the bloody Town car.
  Oh, but, oh, no, you had to walk.

169
00:12:15,118 --> 00:12:20,586
That document lasted 350 years
 before it met you.

170
00:12:20,586 --> 00:12:25,107
Oh, my God, what about the benefit? 
 Oh, I'm going to be humiliated.

171
00:12:25,107 --> 00:12:29,176
Oh, now, calm down, calm down.
 Maybe no one will show up.

172
00:12:29,176 --> 00:12:32,205
Maxwell, it's a sell-out. 
 Look at this.

173
00:12:32,205 --> 00:12:35,744
The princess of Wales is coming.

174
00:12:35,744 --> 00:12:42,010
Diana?  I love her.  Oh, can I go?

175
00:12:42,010 --> 00:12:46,541
Yes, Miss Fine.  You can go and explain
 to everyone why you're toothless.

176
00:12:46,937 --> 00:12:52,681
Oh, I'm sorry.  I thought it was 
some fancy-smancy piece of stationery.

177
00:12:52,681 --> 00:12:59,249
I spent two hours trying to find a pizza
 place called "Two Gentlemen of Barona."

178
00:12:59,249 --> 00:13:02,770
Shakespeare's gone. 
 It was in Miss Fine's stolen purse.

179
00:13:02,982 --> 00:13:06,063
I'll kill you.

180
00:13:13,054 --> 00:13:14,036
Sir ...

181
00:13:20,501 --> 00:13:23,541
Sir, aren't you going to stop her?

182
00:13:23,541 --> 00:13:25,701
Oh, I will.

183
00:13:26,263 --> 00:13:29,240
So they found the perpetrator,
 and Miss Fine is the only witness.

184
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:32,468
Stop!  Stop!  Stop!  We need her alive.

185
00:13:32,942 --> 00:13:35,328
Get dressed.  You and I are going 
down to the police station

186
00:13:35,328 --> 00:13:38,623
to identify the suspect in a lineup 
and hope to God he's still got my Shakespeare.

187
00:13:38,623 --> 00:13:42,094
I don't want to identify him.
  What if he comes back and tries to kill me?

188
00:13:42,094 --> 00:13:44,797
Then he can stand in bloody line.

189
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:49,978
You care more about that stupid piece
 of paper than you do about me.

190
00:13:49,978 --> 00:13:54,455
Oh, no, Miss Fine, that --
 that's not what I meant.

191
00:13:54,455 --> 00:13:59,307
No, of course we care about you. 
Get her, Niles.

192
00:13:59,307 --> 00:14:02,099
Oh, no, I don't want to go. 
 You can't make me.  Oh, Niles,

193
00:14:02,099 --> 00:14:05,691
please, for my obituary picture,
 use the green jump suit from Puerto Rico.

194
00:14:05,691 --> 00:14:09,686
I was thin and tan and having
 a terrific hair day.

195
00:14:23,050 --> 00:14:25,508
Do you recognize any of them?

196
00:14:26,181 --> 00:14:30,955
Can No. 4 push his hair back?
 / Push your hair back, No. 4.

197
00:14:31,942 --> 00:14:34,703
Now, you're talking.
 / Is that him?

198
00:14:34,703 --> 00:14:37,386
No.  But doesn't he look better?

199
00:14:38,142 --> 00:14:42,502
Miss Fine, please concentrate. 
/ Oh, all right.  It's hard to tell.

200
00:14:42,502 --> 00:14:45,240
He was wearing a stocking at the time.

201
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:47,345
Put on the stockings.

202
00:14:51,811 --> 00:14:55,080
Oh, my God, it's him.  
The Sheer Elegance, all-day beige,

203
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:58,678
between the control top 
and the cotton crotch ...

204
00:14:59,563 --> 00:15:01,552
No. 2!

205
00:15:02,076 --> 00:15:03,988
It's No. 2.

206
00:15:07,924 --> 00:15:11,704
Excuse me, detective, where
 do we recover our property?

207
00:15:11,704 --> 00:15:14,693
What? 
/ Well, the items that were stolen.

208
00:15:14,693 --> 00:15:23,470
Oh, this is your first time, isn't it?
 Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!

209
00:15:23,470 --> 00:15:26,672
Hey, Jim, wait'll you hear this one.

210
00:15:28,494 --> 00:15:32,865
My Shakespeare. 
/ Oh, Mr. Sheffield, let it go.

211
00:15:32,865 --> 00:15:38,492
It's like my grandmother always used to say. 
 "Life is like a box of chocolates."

212
00:15:38,492 --> 00:15:40,845
That's from "Forrest Gump."

213
00:15:40,845 --> 00:15:43,674
And they paid her nothing.

214
00:15:47,315 --> 00:15:51,746
Oh, Mr. Sheffield, cheer up.

215
00:15:52,310 --> 00:15:56,055
Here, we'll watch a little TV. 
 That'll take your mind right off of Shakespeare.

216
00:15:56,055 --> 00:15:59,267
Brush up your Shakespeare.

217
00:15:59,267 --> 00:16:04,186
Now back to Severelli's
 "Romeo and Juliette." / Oh, no.

218
00:16:04,186 --> 00:16:08,778
Oh, wait, wait.  They were just
 about to show Romeo's touche.

219
00:16:08,778 --> 00:16:12,072
Miss Fine, please, get me somewhere else.

220
00:16:12,072 --> 00:16:14,096
Mr. Sheffield, look on the bright side.

221
00:16:14,096 --> 00:16:16,983
Instead of your paper, 
it could be me that's missing.

222
00:16:16,983 --> 00:16:19,628
Don't try to cheer me up.

223
00:16:20,499 --> 00:16:24,818
You know, I've got half a mind -- 
/ Well, you've got no argument here.

224
00:16:24,993 --> 00:16:28,446
Well ... / So help me, Miss Fine, 
if I don't get that Shakespeare back --

225
00:16:28,446 --> 00:16:31,040
You know, you can't bully me, 
Maxwell Sheffield.

226
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:34,842
I am not some weak woman -- Hiiii ...

227
00:16:36,158 --> 00:16:39,209
Hi ...  Look at her.  The minute
 he arrives, she gets so ...

228
00:16:39,209 --> 00:16:43,060
Docile, sir? 
/ Yes.  How does he do that?

229
00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:45,492
Fran, I don't want you to panic. 
/ What?  What?

230
00:16:45,492 --> 00:16:48,144
We had to release him.  He's going
 to do community service.

231
00:16:48,144 --> 00:16:52,955
Oh, what kind of justice is this? 
He mugs me, and he walks?

232
00:16:52,955 --> 00:16:57,496
That's the way the system works.  
We lock 'em up; they let them out.

233
00:16:57,496 --> 00:17:01,253
Meanwhile, I ate a couple of
 bing cherries in the A & P,

234
00:17:01,253 --> 00:17:05,352
and I'm rustled to the ground
 like Squeaky Frome.

235
00:17:06,965 --> 00:17:10,794
Look at you, you sweet little thing. 
What you need is a man around the house.

236
00:17:10,794 --> 00:17:15,836
All right.  That's it. First of all, 
there is a man around the house.

237
00:17:15,836 --> 00:17:20,114
I'll lay out your pajamas, sir. 
Would you like warm milk or cocoa?

238
00:17:20,370 --> 00:17:23,278
Thank you, Niles.  You're fired.

239
00:17:23,504 --> 00:17:26,597
And, secondly, there is absolutely 
nothing sweet about her.

240
00:17:26,597 --> 00:17:30,485
Weren't you headed upstairs? 
/ She happens to be brave, confident, and gutsy.

241
00:17:30,485 --> 00:17:34,938
And you've turned her into
 a simpering, whimpering child again.

242
00:17:34,938 --> 00:17:37,392
Anyway, I don't like what you've done to her.

243
00:17:37,392 --> 00:17:43,269
This is not the woman 
I know and, and... know.

244
00:17:43,269 --> 00:17:47,756
Oh, Mr. Sheffield. / So, thank 
you for stopping by, officer.

245
00:17:47,756 --> 00:17:52,806
She'll be just fine.  So why don't you 
just run along and write some tickets.  Huh?

246
00:17:52,806 --> 00:17:57,113
Great.  I'll start with the limo
 parked out front in the red zone.

247
00:17:57,388 --> 00:18:03,064
Go ahead.  Do the ticket.  
Do ten bloody tickets.  I don't care?

248
00:18:03,226 --> 00:18:06,787
I feel sorry for that poor 
bloke whose limo it is.

249
00:18:12,779 --> 00:18:15,794
Now, come on, Miss Fine, 
when you fall off a horse,

250
00:18:15,794 --> 00:18:18,522
it's very important that
 you get right back on.

251
00:18:18,522 --> 00:18:21,937
Oh, Mr. Sheffield, that horse 
analogy never worked with me.

252
00:18:21,937 --> 00:18:25,436
If I fall off a horse, 
I'm calling Jacoby & Meyers.

253
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:32,038
Meanwhile, that little talk Brighten had with 
Miss Babcock seems to be working out well.

254
00:18:32,038 --> 00:18:34,154
Are you talking to me?

255
00:18:34,735 --> 00:18:37,005
Are you talking to me?

256
00:18:41,050 --> 00:18:42,106
Yeah ...

257
00:18:42,601 --> 00:18:45,127
Oh, my God, it's a mugger. 
 There's the mugger.

258
00:18:45,127 --> 00:18:48,155
Miss Fine, Miss Fine, calm down.  
That's not him.

259
00:18:48,155 --> 00:18:51,311
Honestly, every corner we turn,
 you think you've seen your assailant.

260
00:18:51,311 --> 00:18:54,029
Well, that other one really 
looked like him.

261
00:18:54,029 --> 00:18:56,234
That was Yoko Ono.

262
00:18:56,234 --> 00:19:01,076
Yoko Ono.  Oh, I love the way she sings.

263
00:19:01,076 --> 00:19:04,258
Ahhhhh! / It's all right.
  I know, I've got the album.

264
00:19:04,258 --> 00:19:07,847
No.  No.  Ahhhh!  The mugger,
 the mugger, the mugger.

265
00:19:07,847 --> 00:19:09,847
Oh, God, it's you.  No.  Don't be scared.

266
00:19:09,847 --> 00:19:13,621
I'm not scared.  This man is 
an expert at Tai Babalonia.

267
00:19:13,621 --> 00:19:17,523
That's -- that's tae kwon do, 
Miss Fine. / Oh.

268
00:19:17,523 --> 00:19:22,180
I'm bad, I'd bad.  Ahhhh!
 / Ahhhh!  Oh, no, no, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

269
00:19:22,180 --> 00:19:26,446
I swear I've never stolen 
anything before in my life.

270
00:19:26,446 --> 00:19:30,053
I've  been dying to tell you, but I'm not
 allowed within 40 feet of your house.

271
00:19:30,053 --> 00:19:33,199
Why?  Are you single and Jewish?

272
00:19:33,199 --> 00:19:35,968
You see, I'm just down on my luck.
  I can't pay my bills.

273
00:19:35,968 --> 00:19:38,271
Well, get a job.
 / They repossessed my car.

274
00:19:38,271 --> 00:19:41,075
Take a bus.
 / I had to move in with my mother.

275
00:19:41,075 --> 00:19:43,694
Oh, give him a 50.

276
00:19:43,967 --> 00:19:46,114
I don't know how to make it up to you,

277
00:19:46,114 --> 00:19:49,042
but I thought I'd start by returning
 something that looked really important.

278
00:19:49,042 --> 00:19:50,861
Oh, my lipstick, my lipstick.

279
00:19:50,861 --> 00:19:53,282
Oh, my God, my Shakespeare.

280
00:19:53,282 --> 00:19:57,521
Say, if you're a Shakespeare fan,
 there's a festival in New Jersey.

281
00:19:57,521 --> 00:20:00,625
I'd be honored if you'd let me
 treat you to two tickets.

282
00:20:00,625 --> 00:20:06,358
I don't think so. / Oh, Mr. Sheffield,
 the kids are gonna be away all weekend at tennis camp,

283
00:20:06,358 --> 00:20:10,878
and besides we would pass 
by the Donna Karan Outlet Store in Secaucus.

284
00:20:11,578 --> 00:20:14,585
You know what?  We'll go 
on Saturday, but not too close,

285
00:20:14,585 --> 00:20:17,219
cause it's very talky, and they spit.

286
00:20:17,219 --> 00:20:19,572
Bless you.  Thank you.

287
00:20:19,572 --> 00:20:21,307
Miss Fine, to borrow
 from your vernacular.

288
00:20:21,307 --> 00:20:25,306
I'm not schlepping out to New Jersey 
just to relieve your mugger's conscience.

289
00:20:25,306 --> 00:20:27,600
Oh, Mr. Sheffield, forgive and forget.

290
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:31,881
Like my grandmother always says,
 "All's well that ends well."

291
00:20:31,881 --> 00:20:33,864
That's from Shakespeare, Miss Fine.

292
00:20:33,864 --> 00:20:37,122
And, again, she got nothing.

293
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:41,230
Don't look, Miss Fine, but there's
 a man in a French coat headed this way.

294
00:20:41,230 --> 00:20:43,486
Oh, no, that guy's
 just selling Rollexes.

295
00:20:43,486 --> 00:20:47,253
You know, I should get one
 for my father.  Ah, come here.

296
00:20:48,085 --> 00:20:51,421
Open up.  Let me see what you got.  Ohhhhh!

297
00:20:59,457 --> 00:21:03,656
Oh, I'll tell you "Hamlet" 
is my new favorite play --

298
00:21:03,656 --> 00:21:06,938
people eating prime ribs with their hands;

299
00:21:06,938 --> 00:21:09,669
everybody stabbing each other in the back.

300
00:21:09,669 --> 00:21:12,259
I'll tell you, put "Felonious" 
in a powder blue tux,

301
00:21:12,259 --> 00:21:15,562
you got my cousin Claudine's wedding.

302
00:21:16,755 --> 00:21:20,080
Oh, it's good to have you back,
 Miss Fine. I missed you.

303
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:23,922
Oh, Mr. Sheffield, 
is that you talking,

304
00:21:23,922 --> 00:21:27,378
or is it that bottle of Don 
Corlioni we had in the limo.

305
00:21:27,378 --> 00:21:31,248
That's Dom Perignon, Miss Fine.
 / Oh, whatever.

306
00:21:31,248 --> 00:21:32,754
Oh, Miss Fine ...

307
00:21:34,682 --> 00:21:36,333
Fran ...

308
00:21:36,333 --> 00:21:39,337
Mr. Max?

309
00:21:50,276 --> 00:21:53,757
Oh, my God. / We've been cleaned out.

310
00:21:53,757 --> 00:21:57,601
What are the odds the one night
 that we went to the theater?

311
00:21:57,601 --> 00:22:01,025
I'd say the odds are pretty good when 
the robber gives us the bloody tickets, Miss Fine.

312
00:22:01,025 --> 00:22:05,444
Goodness in everyone, hey?
 / Well, at least he left the one
 thing that can't be replaced.

313
00:22:05,444 --> 00:22:08,837
Niles. 
/ Oh, yeah, Niles.

314
00:22:08,837 --> 00:22:13,748
Oh, oh, the alarm company called me. 
I came as far fast as I could.

315
00:22:13,748 --> 00:22:15,488
Oh, my God.  I wonder 
if he took the Monet.

316
00:22:15,488 --> 00:22:17,943
You're right, my earrings.

317
00:22:18,921 --> 00:22:22,533
Go ahead, Maxwell.  See what's missing.
  I'll untie Niles.

318
00:22:24,195 --> 00:22:28,262
Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!

319
00:22:28,262 --> 00:22:30,341
Thank you.
