So why did you--

332

Um, yeah, you know what?.
The truth is,

333

I've ben trying to be a little less
me lately, and that's why this.

334

351
00:20:26,450 --> 00:20:29,327

really strong and energized...

352
00:20:29,369 --> 00:20:31,287
and, uh,
usually graceful.

353
00:20:31,287 --> 00:20:33,330
Right.

354
00:20:33,330 --> 00:20:35,707
- Haveyou never tried it?.
- Oh, no, no, no.

355
00:20:35,748 --> 00:20:38,292
I don't think I could sit still
and breathe for long.

00:20:38,334 --> 00:20:41,336
-I'd panic.
-So what doyou like to do for exercise?.

00:20:41,377 --> 00:20:44,755
Oh, um,
I like basic exercise.

00:20:44,797 --> 00:20:48,049
I like to run orwalk.
Just keep moving, you know?.

359
00:20:48,091 --> 00:20:50,342
I feel like as long
as I'm moving, I'm safe.

360
00:20:50,384 --> 00:20:53,428
- What doyou do when you're sleeping?.
- I'm a terrible insomniac.

361
00:20:53,470 --> 00:20:55,388
Oh, I'm so sorry.
Since when?.

362
00:20:55,388 --> 00:20:57,806
Um, I don't know.

Well, listen, ifyou ever
changeyour mind and wanna try a class,

364
00:21:00,642 --> 00:21:02,560
- I'd be happy to--
- Yeah, I don't think so.

365
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:05,270
Oh, well,
don't decide right now.

366
00:21:05,312 --> 00:21:07,855
Just let it marinate
for a while.

367
00:21:09,231 --> 00:21:11,858
Um-- Okay.

368
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:14,402
I, uh, I will
let it "marinate."

369
00:21:17,779 --> 00:21:19,781
I am never gonna
get a cab.

370
00:21:22,699 --> 00:21:25,493
Maybe just one drink.

371
00:21:25,535 --> 00:21:29,204
Okay,just--
I have, like, 20 minutes.

372
00:21:29,246 --> 00:21:33,082
Well, wait, wait. This Larry,
that must've been pretty serious, huh,

373
00:21:33,124 --> 00:21:36,251
- ifhe proposed?.
- Oh, no, no. I mean-- No, it was.

374
00:21:36,293 --> 00:21:38,169
- It was.
- Well, what happened?.

375
00:21:38,169 --> 00:21:40,421
I--
It wasn't right.

376
00:21:40,462 --> 00:21:42,464
He-He just wasn't funny,
you know?.

377
00:21:42,505 --> 00:21:44,966
- Oh, bummer.
- I think that's been my big thing.

378
00:21:44,966 --> 00:21:48,802
Not smart or not funny,
or not smart and not funny.

379
00:21:48,843 --> 00:21:51,178
Or-Orsmart,

380
00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:54,764
but funny in
a totally unappealing way.

381
00:21:54,806 --> 00:21:56,808
You know?. Just like funny/stupid,
or funny/dopey,

382
00:21:56,849 --> 00:22:00,644
but not funny/witty or funny/ironic
or funny/goofy, you know?.

383
00:22:00,685 --> 00:22:04,813
Or-Or they seem smart, and then
you realize that they aren't at all.

384
00:22:04,855 --> 00:22:08,233
And that's funny,
but funny/tragic.

385
00:22:08,274 --> 00:22:10,192
Um--

386
00:22:12,194 --> 00:22:14,320
So anyway,
ifyou're then lucky enough...

387
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:17,323
to find someone who's the good kind
of smart and the good kind offunny,

388
00:22:17,364 --> 00:22:19,699
then generally
they're just kind of--

389
00:22:19,741 --> 00:22:22,743
- Ugly.
- Ugly.

390
00:22:22,785 --> 00:22:24,703
Ugly. I'm sorry.

391
00:22:24,745 --> 00:22:27,288
- Yes, a little. Is that--
That's awful, right?.
- No.

392
00:22:27,330 --> 00:22:29,248
Ugly doesn't do it froryou.
That's okay.

393
00:22:29,248 --> 00:22:31,958
- Me, I'm kind of into ugly.

394
00:22:31,958 --> 00:22:34,168

397
00:22:41,298 --> 00:22:43,425
Okay, well, um,

399
00:22:46,594 --> 00:22:48,887
- who would fall into the category?.
- Um,yeah.

400
00:22:48,929 --> 00:22:52,682
Hold on a second.

402
00:22:54,933 --> 00:22:58,269
- Is that kind ofthe right idea?.
- Yeah, I guess.

403
00:22:58,311 --> 00:23:01,188
- I was gonna say MickJagger.
He's the big one.

00:23:10,028 --> 00:23:13,697
So, uh--
So you're not--

408
00:23:14,906 --> 00:23:19,618
I mean,
you've-you've tried--

409
00:23:19,660 --> 00:23:22,996
Um, you've dated men.

410
00:23:23,037 --> 00:23:25,289
- Of course.
- Oh, good!

411
00:23:25,331 --> 00:23:27,374
- What?.
- Good. I'm-- No, I'm relieved.

412
00:23:27,374 --> 00:23:31,669
I-I-I just--
I assumed that you had--

413
00:23:33,420 --> 00:23:36,297
Oh, I have... also.

414
00:23:36,339 --> 00:23:38,674
- Oh.
- Yeah, I, um--

415
00:23:38,674 --> 00:23:41,175
I just find a lot

416
00:23:41,217 --> 00:23:44,761
Oh. I don't.

417
00:23:46,554 --> 00:23:48,639
So, should we settle
the tab?.

418
00:23:48,681 --> 00:23:52,058

420
00:23:54,102 --> 00:23:56,729
- No. I lied.
- But I thought--

421
00:23:59,981 --> 00:24:01,982
I know a great Indian place.

422
00:24:04,859 --> 00:24:07,361

- Would you feel comfortable?.
Is that something--
- No, of course.

428
00:24:21,288 --> 00:24:24,916
I'd love to share.
I start with Mac Viva Glam III,

429
00:24:24,957 --> 00:24:26,876
- Uh-huh. Right.
- which is a great base,

430
00:24:26,917 --> 00:24:29,753
- and then I add
Prescriptive's Poodle on top.
- I love Prescriptive's.

431
00:24:29,753 --> 00:24:32,880
- Isn't it the best?.
The moisture and the spray.
- It has the best texture.

432
00:24:32,922 --> 00:24:38,009
And then I finish with Philosophy
Supernatural Nude, which is more ofa--

433
00:24:38,050 --> 00:24:40,677
- Ofa glossy kind ofthing?.
- Exactly. For the shine.

434
00:24:40,719 --> 00:24:43,137

- That's it.
- Wow.

436
00:24:45,723 --> 00:24:49,183
Well, it looks, um,
just beautiful on you.

437
00:24:49,225 --> 00:24:51,727
Oh, thankyou.
Hey, you should try ityourself.

438
00:24:51,769 --> 00:24:53,937
It would look gorgeous
on your complexion.

439
00:24:53,937 --> 00:24:56,439
Oh, thankyou.
But, um--

440
00:24:56,480 --> 00:25:01,734
Yeah, the blending thing is a little
labor-intensive for me, you know?.

441
00:25:01,776 --> 00:25:04,028
I'm kind oflooking
for that one.

442
00:25:04,028 --> 00:25:06,321
Well,you'll neverfindit.

443
00:25:06,363 --> 00:25:08,489

00:25:17,329 --> 00:25:22,708
Greg. Right, okay.
And, um-- D.o you have a fravorite?

447
00:25:22,750 --> 00:25:25,543
U m, no, not particularly.

448
00:25:27,461 --> 00:25:30,922
Wel l, does one of them
get more time than everyone else?.

449
00:25:30,964 --> 00:25:33,216
- Or, you know, a favorite one?.
- No.

450
00:25:34,758 --> 00:25:38,595
I mean, basically,
I call Roland when I'm hungry,

451
00:25:38,636 --> 00:25:41,764
Steven when I'm bored,
and Greg when I'm horny.

452
00:25:41,805 --> 00:25:45,808
- Who doyou call when you're sick?.
- I don't get sick.

453
00:25:45,850 --> 00:25:47,976
Oh.
Good system.

454
00:25:47,976 --> 00:25:50,687
That's crazy!
Who doesn't do E-mail?.

455
00:25:50,728 --> 00:25:52,897
I hate computers.
I object to them.

456
00:25:52,897 --> 00:25:55,148
- Butyou must use them at the office.
- Yes.

457
00:25:55,148 --> 00:25:57,942
At work I'm forced to,
but never at home.

458
00:25:57,984 --> 00:26:02,070
I mean, even at the office I don't
send E-mails. I just receive them.

459
00:26:02,112 --> 00:26:04,822
But-But--

460
00:26:04,864 --> 00:26:07,699
- What?.
- Have you discussed this
with your therapist?.

461
00:26:07,741 --> 00:26:09,659
Oh, no.

462
00:26:09,701 --> 00:26:12,661
-There's too much on the agenda already.
-Like what?.

463
00:26:12,703 --> 00:26:14,954
- Um,just the usual.
- ## [Tambourines ]

464
00:26:14,996 --> 00:26:18,582
Older, nothing to show for it, no kids
or anything, why am I on the planet?.

465
00:26:18,624 --> 00:26:20,917
Like that.
God, they're so crazy.

466
00:26:20,959 --> 00:26:24,336
- Um, no more so than anyone else.
- What?

467
00:26:24,378 --> 00:26:26,963
A little more so,
I'd say.

468
00:26:27,005 --> 00:26:30,424
- I don't think so.
- But theyare, objectively.

469
00:26:30,466 --> 00:26:32,384
I think they're, you know,
just doing their thing.

470
00:26:32,426 --> 00:26:36,429
They don't do anything.
They play the tambourine all day
and ask people for money.

471
00:26:36,470 --> 00:26:38,388
- They have no goals.
- I think theyhave a prettyloftygoal.

472
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:41,015
Oh, really?. What?.
New robes?.

473
00:26:41,015 --> 00:26:43,350
- Spiritual enlightenment, happiness.
- Come on.

474
00:26:43,392 --> 00:26:46,061
- They're weird. Look at them.
- They're happy.

475
00:26:46,061 --> 00:26:48,104
- They're happy.
- What?.

476
00:26:48,145 --> 00:26:51,356
Some people smoke pot. Some people
bungee jump. Some people chant.

477
00:26:51,398 --> 00:26:56,693
- What doyou do to be happy?
- Nothing. I'm not. Wait, wait, wait.

478
00:26:56,735 --> 00:27:00,321
I have a job. I mean, I'm accomplishing
something in the world.

479
00:27:00,363 --> 00:27:02,239
Oh, really?.
What areyou accomplishing?.

480
00:27:02,239 --> 00:27:04,324
I'm-I'm bringing
