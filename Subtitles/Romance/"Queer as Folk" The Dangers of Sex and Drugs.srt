MISS A THING.

857
00:44:08,646 --> 00:44:10,147
HOW WAS
THE PARTY?

858
00:44:10,648 --> 00:44:12,650
OH, INCREDIBLY
TEDIOUS.

859
00:44:13,150 --> 00:44:14,151
I LEFT EARLY.

860
00:44:14,652 --> 00:44:17,655
BET THE SAP
DIDN'T LIKE THAT.

861
00:44:17,655 --> 00:44:20,157
FUCK THE SAP.

862
00:44:20,658 --> 00:44:22,660
ANYWAY...

863
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:27,364
I QUIT.

864
00:44:27,364 --> 00:44:28,866
I DECIDED
THAT...

865
00:44:28,866 --> 00:44:31,368
WORKING ALL NIGHT
AND GOING TO SCHOOL
DURING THE DAY

866
00:44:31,368 --> 00:44:36,073
WAS COUNTERPRODUCTIVE
TO MY GOALS.

867
00:44:36,073 --> 00:44:38,075
I NEED TO
PRIORITIZE,

868
00:44:38,075 --> 00:44:40,577
CONCENTRATE
ON MY ART.

869
00:44:40,577 --> 00:44:43,080
SO...

870
00:44:43,080 --> 00:44:45,082
I'D LIKE TO TAKE YOU
UP ON YOUR OFFER...

871
00:44:45,582 --> 00:44:49,586
IF IT STILL STANDS.

872
00:44:49,586 --> 00:44:54,591
IT STILL STANDS.

873
00:44:55,092 --> 00:44:58,095
WE'LL NEED TO
DISCUSS THE TERMS
OF THE LOAN...

874
00:44:58,095 --> 00:45:02,099
INTEREST,
REPAYMENT
SCHEDULE.

875
00:45:02,099 --> 00:45:05,602
AND WE SHOULD
HAVE SOMETHING
IN WRITING.

876
00:45:05,602 --> 00:45:14,111
OF COURSE.
MM-HMM.

877
00:45:14,111 --> 00:45:18,115
SO, WHAT MADE
YOU CHANGE
YOUR MIND?

878
00:45:18,615 --> 00:45:53,150
A MAN NEEDS TO
KNOW WHEN TO
ASK FOR HELP.
