DROP DEAD!

12
00:03:01,647 --> 00:03:05,242
Det. Horibe, were you and Nishi
classmates in junior high?

13
00:03:05,407 --> 00:03:07,238
In senior high, too.

14
00:03:07,487 --> 00:03:09,523
And your wives are friends, too?

15
00:03:09,687 --> 00:03:12,440
That's right.
Do you remember, Nishi?

16
00:03:12,887 --> 00:03:14,479
At the amusement park.

17
00:03:14,647 --> 00:03:16,603
We picked them up, didn't we?

18
00:03:16,767 --> 00:03:18,439
Nishi got the pretty one

19
00:03:18,687 --> 00:03:20,279
and I got the dog.

20
00:03:21,007 --> 00:03:22,599
What are you laughing at?

21
00:03:23,167 --> 00:03:24,361
Hey, stop the car.

22
00:03:24,527 --> 00:03:26,358
Go get some bean cakes.

23
00:03:26,527 --> 00:03:27,676
Yes, sir.

24
00:03:41,527 --> 00:03:43,279
How is your wife?

25
00:03:46,127 --> 00:03:48,402
It's been two years, hasn't it?

26
00:03:50,367 --> 00:03:54,485
My wife is healthy as hell,
but it must be tough for you.

27
00:03:56,407 --> 00:03:58,557
Been to the hospital lately?

28
00:03:58,727 --> 00:04:01,480
The stakeout's near the hospital.
Go see her.

29
00:04:02,167 --> 00:04:04,727
Go on.
We don't have much to do today.

30
00:04:14,607 --> 00:04:16,598
- How much?
- 1,200 yen.

31
00:04:16,767 --> 00:04:19,645
- For bean cakes?
- Yes, just the bean cakes.

32
00:04:19,807 --> 00:04:23,800
Idiot! There's too much
for the 3 of us! You pay for it.

33
00:04:24,047 --> 00:04:25,275
But...

34
00:04:25,607 --> 00:04:27,199
These are the wrong ones.

35
00:04:27,367 --> 00:04:30,279
- Were there any chestnut ones?
- Steamed?

36
00:04:30,447 --> 00:04:32,438
Not the hot spring kind!

37
00:04:32,807 --> 00:04:37,085
It's straight to the amusement park
with no sleep for me tomorrow.

38
00:04:37,247 --> 00:04:39,442
I spoil my daughter.

39
00:04:46,767 --> 00:04:49,839
Smart place to park!
I can't even get out!

40
00:04:51,127 --> 00:04:52,765
I'll go check.

41
00:05:10,047 --> 00:05:12,402
Don't play ball here, you idiots!

42
00:05:16,127 --> 00:05:17,162
Sorry!

43
00:05:26,847 --> 00:05:27,916
Well?

44
00:05:28,087 --> 00:05:29,839
No way he'd come here.

45
00:05:30,007 --> 00:05:33,636
He won't come back to his apartment
after that massacre.

46
00:05:34,047 --> 00:05:36,003
What's the chief thinking of?

47
00:05:36,167 --> 00:05:37,486
I know.

48
00:05:37,647 --> 00:05:40,605
Is that how you dress
for a stakeout?

49
00:05:41,007 --> 00:05:42,998
You're not on a date.

50
00:05:43,367 --> 00:05:47,076
Nishi's going to the hospital.
Can you stay on?

51
00:05:47,567 --> 00:05:49,285
Well, I have a date...

52
00:05:49,447 --> 00:05:50,926
Screw you!

53
00:05:51,527 --> 00:05:53,483
How is Nishi's wife?

54
00:05:54,247 --> 00:05:56,203
Not too good, I hear.

55
00:05:56,887 --> 00:05:58,320
Is it cancer?

56
00:05:58,887 --> 00:06:00,479
Watch what you say.

57
00:06:01,807 --> 00:06:03,718
First their daughter died...

58
00:06:03,887 --> 00:06:06,276
She was only 4 or 5, wasn't she?

59
00:06:06,447 --> 00:06:09,166
That was a bigger shock
than her illness.

60
00:06:10,847 --> 00:06:13,361
I visited his wife a while back.

61
00:06:13,527 --> 00:06:15,358
She didn't say a word.

62
00:06:16,087 --> 00:06:18,157
I'm glad my wife is so healthy.

63
00:06:18,327 --> 00:06:20,158
Must be hard on Nishi.

64
00:06:20,327 --> 00:06:23,956
Daughter dies, wife gets sick,
and he's a damn cop.

65
00:06:25,487 --> 00:06:27,796
So busy he can't even visit her.

66
00:06:28,327 --> 00:06:29,806
I'll stay on.

67
00:06:30,007 --> 00:06:32,646
Not you, Tanaka.
You're a family man.

68
00:06:32,887 --> 00:06:35,196
Come on, stay on for 3 hours.

69
00:06:35,607 --> 00:06:37,165
No, I can't.

70
00:06:37,887 --> 00:06:40,355
OK, I'll stay. You can go.

71
00:06:54,167 --> 00:06:55,839
Can I get a lift?

72
00:07:00,447 --> 00:07:02,119
How's your wife?

73
00:07:03,087 --> 00:07:05,237
I'll go visit her some time.

74
00:07:18,927 --> 00:07:20,360
Hello. It's me.

75
00:07:21,407 --> 00:07:23,238
I'm not coming home tonight.

76
00:07:23,887 --> 00:07:25,240
I know that.

77
00:07:25,847 --> 00:07:27,997
What can I do? It's my job.

78
00:07:28,207 --> 00:07:29,925
Let me talk to Michi.

79
00:07:31,567 --> 00:07:33,637
Michi, it's daddy.

80
00:07:34,807 --> 00:07:36,399
I'm at work.

81
00:07:37,487 --> 00:07:40,047
The amusement park? Another time.

82
00:07:41,327 --> 00:07:45,240
What? You drew a picture?
Where did you draw it?

83
00:07:52,287 --> 00:07:54,437
You shouldn't do that.

84
00:07:54,887 --> 00:07:57,355
Yes, it's very pretty.

85
00:08:55,327 --> 00:08:58,364
- Drive me to Shibuya.
- I can't.

86
00:08:58,607 --> 00:09:00,643
My date's waiting for me there.

87
00:09:00,807 --> 00:09:02,798
No. I have to wait for him.

88
00:09:04,207 --> 00:09:05,959
I'll go by cab then.

89
00:09:06,967 --> 00:09:09,117
Is Nishi's wife really dying?

90
00:09:09,287 --> 00:09:12,245
Dammit! Don't say that.
It's bad luck.

91
00:09:12,407 --> 00:09:15,479
- Leukemia, right?
- Why don't you shut up?

92
00:10:24,367 --> 00:10:25,846
Excuse me.

93
00:10:26,607 --> 00:10:29,201
The doctor wants to speak to you.

94
00:10:56,527 --> 00:10:59,963
Modern medicine
can't work miracles.

95
00:11:01,407 --> 00:11:03,443
We've done all we can.

96
00:11:04,687 --> 00:11:08,646
I think it would be better
to take her home.

97
00:11:09,807 --> 00:11:13,038
The child's death was a real blow.

98
00:11:14,287 --> 00:11:17,996
She'll be better off at home
than in the hospital.

99
00:11:29,687 --> 00:11:32,997
Excuse me. Could you call Mr Nishi?

100
00:11:33,167 --> 00:11:34,520
Just a moment.

101
00:11:39,407 --> 00:11:41,318
Mr Nishi, someone to see you.

102
00:11:51,567 --> 00:11:53,285
Det. Horibe's been shot.

103
00:12:38,167 --> 00:12:40,237
Even when they're married,

104
00:12:40,967 --> 00:12:43,401
people just think about themselves.

105
00:12:45,767 --> 00:12:47,917
When I came home,

106
00:12:48,087 --> 00:12:51,124
my wife and child
couldn't even look at me.

107
00:12:51,487 --> 00:12:53,603
The light wasn't even on.

108
00:12:54,287 --> 00:12:56,323
They just said goodbye.

109
00:12:58,047 --> 00:12:59,878
Now that I'm a wreck

110
00:13:00,047 --> 00:13:02,117
they leave me just like that.

111
00:13:02,887 --> 00:13:07,165
Actually, it may be better this way.

112
00:13:08,167 --> 00:13:10,203
But I've got nothing to do.

113
00:13:11,127 --> 00:13:15,518
My mom says I should
take up a hobby or something.

114
00:13:16,287 --> 00:13:17,959
Haiku.

115
00:13:18,407 --> 00:13:20,716
She wanted me to join
a poetry group.

116
00:13:20,887 --> 00:13:23,162
Give me a break.

117
00:13:23,647 --> 00:13:26,480
Work is all I've ever known.

118
00:13:29,207 --> 00:13:31,721
Since I live by the seaside,

119
00:13:32,127 --> 00:13:34,083
maybe I should try painting.

120
00:13:34,247 --> 00:13:36,363
But I've never painted anything.

121
00:13:36,967 --> 00:13:39,242
I wouldn't know where to start.

122
00:13:40,807 --> 00:13:43,275
And the materials don't come cheap.

123
00:13:47,047 --> 00:13:49,800
Don't get me wrong.
It's not your fault.

124
00:13:52,607 --> 00:13:54,837
Maybe I'll buy a beret.

125
00:15:22,927 --> 00:15:24,360
Don't worry.

126
00:15:24,527 --> 00:15:26,882
You're very kind.

127
00:15:28,367 --> 00:15:31,723
After all, my husband
died in the line of duty.

128
00:15:34,087 --> 00:15:38,399
Because of the recession,
good jobs are hard to come by,

129
00:15:40,287 --> 00:15:43,404
but I'm helping out at a deli.

130
00:15:44,927 --> 00:15:46,565
The hardest part is...

131
00:15:52,487 --> 00:15:57,197
when my son tells me
he misses his dad.

132
00:15:58,007 --> 00:15:59,156
It's so sad...

133
00:16:03,687 --> 00:16:06,759
But I'm sure he'll understand soon.

134
00:16:07,207 --> 00:16:08,845
We'll be OK.

135
00:16:14,367 --> 00:16:17,006
I have to get back to work.

136
00:16:46,047 --> 00:16:47,480
I've decided...

137
00:16:49,407 --> 00:16:51,284
to get married.

138
00:16:52,367 --> 00:16:53,720
Who to?

139
00:16:55,087 --> 00:16:57,078
I really wasn't serious about her,

140
00:16:57,447 --> 00:17:01,156
but when I was injured,
she visited me every day.

141
00:17:01,607 --> 00:17:03,404
I was touched by that.

142
00:17:10,207 --> 00:17:11,720
Can you answer that?

143
00:17:12,367 --> 00:17:13,880
Excuse me.

144
00:17:17,207 --> 00:17:18,925
Kudo speaking.

145
00:17:24,407 --> 00:17:26,045
The other day,

146
00:17:26,967 --> 00:17:29,356
I went to see Mr Horibe.

147
00:17:33,167 --> 00:17:35,476
He seemed so lonely.

148
00:17:39,167 --> 00:17:41,920
They were
such a close-knit family...

149
00:17:42,087 --> 00:17:44,760
but his wife and child left him.

150
00:17:59,967 --> 00:18:03,880
You know,
you really shouldn't feel guilty...

151
00:18:06,847 --> 00:18:09,441
Tanaka's death
isn't your fault either.

152
00:18:11,207 --> 00:18:13,163
He died in the line of duty.

153
00:18:16,127 --> 00:18:18,038
It's nobody's fault.

154
00:18:54,847 --> 00:18:56,439
This way, please.

155
00:18:56,607 --> 00:18:58,040
Shut up!

156
00:19:08,447 --> 00:19:10,756
- Yes, sir?
- Shut up!

157
00:19:14,047 --> 00:19:15,480
Hey, Nishi.

158
00:19:16,607 --> 00:19:20,156
The boss is mad. You haven't paid
the interest this month.

159
00:19:20,967 --> 00:19:23,197
You better pay up!

160
00:19:24,447 --> 00:19:27,007
You know what we yakuza are like!

161
00:19:27,407 --> 00:19:29,318
After all, you were a cop.

162
00:19:29,487 --> 00:19:33,196
Without the badge,
he's just an ordinary guy.

163
00:19:33,367 --> 00:19:36,200
He's less than that - he's a bum.

164
00:22:09,967 --> 00:22:11,719
How's your wife?

165
00:22:14,967 --> 00:22:17,959
Here are her usual pills.

166
00:22:19,927 --> 00:22:22,441
But I don't think
they'll do her much good.

167
00:22:24,327 --> 00:22:27,319
Don't think about it too much.

168
00:22:27,687 --> 00:22:31,362
When you're with her,
talk to her as much as possible.

169
00:22:32,727 --> 00:22:36,800
You could even take her on a trip.

170
00:22:37,767 --> 00:22:40,327
If anything happens, call me.

171
00:22:44,127 --> 00:22:46,516
Here's a shirt for you.

172
00:22:46,687 --> 00:22:50,236
It might be too big for you,
but you can have it.

173
00:22:51,607 --> 00:22:53,598
Please try to be more careful.

174
00:23:47,047 --> 00:23:48,196
Hello.

175
00:24:15,127 --> 00:24:16,719
It's Horibe...

176
00:24:18,087 --> 00:24:20,203
He attempted suicide.

177
00:24:21,047 --> 00:24:23,607
Luckily his landlord found him.

178
00:24:23,767 --> 00:24:25,997
I think he'll make it,

179
00:24:26,367 --> 00:24:27,356
but he took

180
00:24:28,407 --> 00:24:30,557
a lot of sleeping pills.

181
00:24:39,927 --> 00:24:43,476
Are his wife and daughter there?

182
00:25:05,767 --> 00:25:07,917
He's asleep now.

183
00:25:08,087 --> 00:25:11,363
He should be OK
in a couple of days.

184
00:25:31,127 --> 00:25:32,685
Shall we go?

185
00:26:24,887 --> 00:26:27,242
- Let me out here.
- I'll take you home.

186
00:26:27,407 --> 00:26:29,159
It's OK. I'll get out.

187
00:26:30,487 --> 00:26:32,000
Stop the car.

188
00:26:52,407 --> 00:26:55,444
What sort of a detective
was Mr Nishi?

189
00:26:56,287 --> 00:26:58,278
He was a great cop.

190
00:26:59,087 --> 00:27:01,396
Decorated lots of times.

191
00:27:04,367 --> 00:27:07,325
He and Mr Horibe were a great team.

192
00:27:07,847 --> 00:27:11,999
Whenever Mr Horibe got too rough,
Mr Nishi would stop him.

193
00:27:20,367 --> 00:27:24,883
You haven't even paid back your debt
and you want another 4 million!

194
00:27:26,007 --> 00:27:30,000
Why should we lend it to you?
You can't even pay the interest.

195
00:27:30,167 --> 00:27:34,877
You poked my guy's eye out.
Who's going to pay for that?

196
00:27:35,087 --> 00:27:37,203
- Is that a loan, too?
- Forget it!

197
00:27:37,367 --> 00:27:40,359
If he can't pay us back,
he can work for us.

198
00:27:40,727 --> 00:27:42,558
What do you have in mind?

199
00:27:42,887 --> 00:27:45,242
He could be my bodyguard.

200
00:27:46,847 --> 00:27:48,678
Great idea!

201
00:27:49,047 --> 00:27:52,005
He keeps shooting
when the other guy's gun

202
00:27:52,167 --> 00:27:53,361
is empty.

203
00:27:55,807 --> 00:28:00,756
But when Mr Nishi really lost it,
he was more frightening.

204
00:28:03,167 --> 00:28:04,839
Like that time...

205
00:28:06,007 --> 00:28:09,363
when he emptied his gun
into a corpse.

206
00:30:26,767 --> 00:30:28,200
Hello.

207
00:30:29,487 --> 00:30:30,886
How are you?

208
00:30:31,327 --> 00:30:33,238
Doing all right.

209
00:30:37,927 --> 00:30:39,997
Watch out, asshole!

210
00:30:40,167 --> 00:30:42,317
I had the right of way!

211
00:30:42,487 --> 00:30:44,842
On narrow roads,
big cars should yield!

212
00:30:45,007 --> 00:30:46,440
- Are you crazy?
- What?

213
00:30:46,607 --> 00:30:49,519
- Driving such a tiny car!
- What's it to you?

214
00:30:49,687 --> 00:30:51,996
- Fix it yourself.
- Mind your business!

215
00:30:52,207 --> 00:30:54,880
- Want some more?
- What?

216
00:30:55,047 --> 00:30:56,605
Well?

217
00:30:56,887 --> 00:30:58,479
I'm sorry.

218
00:30:58,647 --> 00:31:00,285
Are you done?

219
00:32:25,447 --> 00:32:28,086
- What's going on?
- He's in a coffee shop.

220
00:32:31,007 --> 00:32:34,716
He has a gun and with all
these people, we can't do a thing.

221
00:32:36,287 --> 00:32:37,276
How's Horibe?

222
00:32:37,447 --> 00:32:39,722
Don't know yet.
He's at the hospital.

223
00:32:39,887 --> 00:32:42,242
He got hit in the belly.

224
00:35:07,887 --> 00:35:09,684
What are you doing?

225
00:35:11,447 --> 00:35:13,563
Can you sell me that light?

226
00:35:14,607 --> 00:35:17,201
You mean the police light?

227
00:35:17,367 --> 00:35:18,880
What do you want it for?

228
00:35:19,207 --> 00:35:21,437
I'm thinking of robbing a bank.

229
00:35:27,407 --> 00:35:28,840
Sounds great!

230
00:35:29,007 --> 00:35:31,726
Take it. You can have it.

231
00:35:32,967 --> 00:35:34,525
Good luck.

232
00:35:42,647 --> 00:35:45,764
Do some work,
you glue-sniffing bum!

233
00:38:37,607 --> 00:38:39,643
You want 500,000 for this?

234
00:38:39,807 --> 00:38:41,320
No, not this one.

235
00:38:41,487 --> 00:38:42,886
The other one.

236
00:38:48,087 --> 00:38:49,406
What other one?

237
00:38:49,567 --> 00:38:51,000
This one.

238
00:38:53,727 --> 00:38:55,285
But it's a taxi cab!

239
00:38:55,567 --> 00:38:57,239
It's mine.

240
00:38:58,767 --> 00:39:00,086
How come?

241
00:39:00,327 --> 00:39:02,966
- It belongs to me.
- You didn't steal it?

242
00:39:03,127 --> 00:39:04,765
No, it's mine.

243
00:39:04,967 --> 00:39:07,117
- How old are you?
- 20.

244
00:39:07,287 --> 00:39:09,278
You can't get a cab license at 20!

245
00:39:10,327 --> 00:39:12,158
I'll call the cops!

246
00:40:01,407 --> 00:40:05,764
The fender's a bit dented,
but you can have it for 200,000.

247
00:40:06,407 --> 00:40:08,398
This car is hot.

248
00:40:09,647 --> 00:40:11,524
How about 50,000?

249
00:40:18,127 --> 00:40:20,197
What happened at the bar?

250
00:40:20,367 --> 00:40:22,927
Like I said, the waiter apologized

251
00:40:23,087 --> 00:40:26,159
for spilling soy sauce on my jacket.

252
00:40:26,327 --> 00:40:28,079
And gave you 100,000 yen!

253
00:40:28,967 --> 00:40:31,481
It was an Armani suit and...

254
00:40:31,647 --> 00:40:34,115
Armani? You're kidding!

255
00:40:34,287 --> 00:40:35,925
Genuine Armani.

256
00:40:37,407 --> 00:40:38,396
And?

257
00:40:38,567 --> 00:40:41,365
And I needed
some money for the taxi and...

258
00:40:41,527 --> 00:40:42,960
For the taxi?

259
00:40:43,127 --> 00:40:45,595
100,000 yen for the taxi! Where to?

260
00:40:45,767 --> 00:40:47,405
Oita, on the southern isle.

261
00:40:47,567 --> 00:40:49,558
Don't bullshit me.

262
00:40:51,167 --> 00:40:53,317
Do you take us for fools?

263
00:40:53,487 --> 00:40:56,559
- He offered it to me.
- That's extortion!

264
00:40:56,727 --> 00:40:57,955
Not at all.

265
00:40:58,127 --> 00:41:00,038
Cut the crap!

266
00:41:57,807 --> 00:41:59,763
I'll throw this in, too.

267
00:46:15,687 --> 00:46:16,403
Hi!

268
00:46:19,767 --> 00:46:21,962
Can I help you?

269
00:46:34,727 --> 00:46:38,003
METROPOLITAN POLICE

270
00:48:23,727 --> 00:48:27,003
You're just a yakuza loan shark!

271
00:48:27,407 --> 00:48:29,602
An expert at dirty tricks.

272
00:48:32,407 --> 00:48:36,241
You borrow money off me
and call me a loan shark!

273
00:48:36,407 --> 00:48:40,286
Well, aren't you? You don't
respect the terms of the contract.

274
00:48:40,447 --> 00:48:45,123
Your interest rate's outrageous.
You can wait a while!

275
00:48:46,247 --> 00:48:49,796
You've been saying that
for months, you bastard!

276
00:48:49,967 --> 00:48:52,003
We're running a business!

277
00:48:52,567 --> 00:48:54,797
You can't get blood from a stone.

278
00:48:56,487 --> 00:48:58,318
Want a bullet in your head?

279
00:48:59,007 --> 00:49:01,362
I dare you, you two-bit punk!

280
00:49:11,767 --> 00:49:13,120
Hey!

281
00:49:23,967 --> 00:49:25,366
What do you want, boy?

282
00:51:22,207 --> 00:51:24,926
Good luck with the bank robbery.

283
00:51:45,287 --> 00:51:46,606
Miss...

284
00:51:47,367 --> 00:51:49,722
I found it there. How much?

285
00:51:49,887 --> 00:51:51,957
You can have it. It's junk.

286
00:51:52,127 --> 00:51:55,324
Junk, huh? Is the rest junk, too?

287
00:52:08,287 --> 00:52:10,881
- What are you doing?
- Salvaging junk.

288
00:52:11,087 --> 00:52:12,566
What do you mean "junk"?

289
00:52:12,727 --> 00:52:14,206
Isn't this junk?

290
00:52:14,367 --> 00:52:16,597
It's merchandise, asshole!

291
00:52:17,767 --> 00:52:19,598
Hey, I recognize you!

292
00:55:11,847 --> 00:55:14,407
Hey! I've been hit!

293
00:55:14,727 --> 00:55:15,876
Hey, wait!

294
00:55:16,087 --> 00:55:17,918
Stupid cop, wait!

295
00:55:19,847 --> 00:55:22,839
I'm a hit-and-run victim!

296
00:55:23,007 --> 00:55:24,804
You waste of public money!

297
00:56:12,447 --> 00:56:14,756
I should've sold it for 200,000.

298
00:56:20,047 --> 00:56:22,038
Wake up!

299
00:56:36,647 --> 00:56:38,239
8 of hearts.

300
00:56:43,607 --> 00:56:45,438
4 of clubs.

301
00:56:51,407 --> 00:56:53,238
Queen of diamonds.

302
00:56:56,847 --> 00:56:58,599
10 of hearts.

303
00:57:03,367 --> 00:57:05,085
Ace of diamonds.

304
00:57:10,367 --> 00:57:12,483
Queen of clubs.

305
00:57:23,207 --> 00:57:24,879
Crunchy chocolate!

306
00:59:17,287 --> 00:59:18,197
Goodbye.

307
00:59:18,367 --> 00:59:20,085
Thank you very much.

308
00:59:36,967 --> 00:59:39,003
Why don't you keep it?

309
00:59:39,407 --> 00:59:42,046
I'm sure he wants you to.

310
00:59:51,847 --> 00:59:55,522
Mr Nishi was really worried
about you.

311
00:59:58,527 --> 00:59:59,801
Goodbye.

312
01:00:38,247 --> 01:00:41,637
I can't believe it!
He paid back all his debts!

313
01:00:41,927 --> 01:00:43,918
Did he rob a bank?

314
01:00:44,087 --> 01:00:46,203
No, he wouldn't do that!

315
01:00:46,367 --> 01:00:48,323
Right. He's not like you!

316
01:00:48,487 --> 01:00:52,002
To make a fortune,
I'd play the stock market.

317
01:00:52,447 --> 01:00:54,915
- Extort companies?
- Don't use that word!

318
01:00:55,087 --> 01:00:57,237
The boss is a legit businessman.

319
01:00:57,407 --> 01:00:59,363
A businessman packing a piece!

320
01:01:49,687 --> 01:01:51,564
HANDLE WITH CARE

321
01:02:18,887 --> 01:02:20,320
Nobody home.

322
01:02:21,287 --> 01:02:23,323
Did you ask the neighbors?

323
01:02:23,807 --> 01:02:25,718
Go ask them, you fool!

324
01:06:17,447 --> 01:06:20,564
More! A bit more!

325
01:06:20,727 --> 01:06:22,365
More, I said!

326
01:08:22,407 --> 01:08:23,999
Look.

327
01:08:24,847 --> 01:08:27,407
What a big bell!

328
01:08:28,567 --> 01:08:30,637
Look at the size of it!

329
01:08:30,807 --> 01:08:35,244
It goes "gong" when you hit it.

330
01:08:38,847 --> 01:08:41,520
You can't hit it now.

331
01:08:41,847 --> 01:08:45,362
But you'll hear it this evening.

332
01:08:51,727 --> 01:08:54,799
Well, it's time to go home now.

333
01:09:53,087 --> 01:09:55,726
LUCKY CHARM

334
01:10:07,487 --> 01:10:09,876
All this free time is tough.

335
01:10:10,927 --> 01:10:13,760
I paint pictures to kill time,

336
01:10:14,207 --> 01:10:16,198
but I'm only an amateur.

337
01:10:16,647 --> 01:10:18,922
I can't find anything to paint.

338
01:10:26,607 --> 01:10:28,837
Hasn't Mr Nishi been in touch?

339
01:10:29,287 --> 01:10:30,925
Not recently.

340
01:10:31,847 --> 01:10:34,964
But he sent me
some art materials a while ago.

341
01:10:35,127 --> 01:10:37,163
I didn't know what to say.

342
01:10:37,847 --> 01:10:40,566
With his wife sick,
he must be very busy.

343
01:10:49,207 --> 01:10:50,196
To be honest...

344
01:10:50,727 --> 01:10:53,605
I don't think
his wife has long to live.

345
01:10:54,207 --> 01:10:57,882
But in a way,
he's better off than me.

346
01:11:28,847 --> 01:11:31,202
What are you giving them water for?

347
01:11:32,527 --> 01:11:34,404
Those flowers are dead.

348
01:11:40,287 --> 01:11:44,917
Hey, it's no use
watering dead flowers!

349
01:11:45,447 --> 01:11:48,678
Did you get ditched by a guy
and lose your mind?

350
01:13:44,047 --> 01:13:45,605
I'll be right back.

351
01:14:27,007 --> 01:14:30,204
Boss says you forgot the interest.

352
01:14:53,887 --> 01:14:55,320
Hey!

353
01:15:09,887 --> 01:15:12,321
Go on, shoot me, punk.

354
01:15:13,007 --> 01:15:14,360
Go on.

355
01:15:20,007 --> 01:15:21,440
Open your mouth.

356
01:15:26,727 --> 01:15:28,638
Next time, I'll kill you.

357
01:16:53,887 --> 01:16:56,037
There! ltalian-style cooking.

358
01:17:20,927 --> 01:17:22,360
Step on it!

359
01:17:22,607 --> 01:17:23,483
Go on!

360
01:17:24,367 --> 01:17:25,766
No. Forward!

361
01:17:26,807 --> 01:17:28,320
Forward!

362
01:17:38,447 --> 01:17:40,756
Why did you want to see the snow?

363

364
01:17:43,847 --> 01:17:46,122
You're going to catch a cold.

365
01:17:47,407 --> 01:17:49,079
My hand hurts.

366
01:18:03,087 --> 01:18:04,759

with your husband?

372
01:19:39,687 --> 01:19:40,517
Smile.

373
01:19:43,967 --> 01:19:45,161

SUICIDE

378
01:21:55,647 --> 01:21:57,285
Excuse me.

379
01:21:58,847 --> 01:22:02,157
There's someone to see you.

380
01:22:38,007 --> 01:22:39,201
What do you want?

381
01:22:39,367 --> 01:22:42,245
The boss is here. Come with me.

382
01:22:42,767 --> 01:22:45,486

- You'll find out.

383
01:22:46,367 --> 01:22:48,244

384
01:22:57,687 --> 01:22:59,200
Sorry about your eye.

385
01:24:05,327 --> 01:24:07,602
How much money do you have left?

386
01:24:08,327 --> 01:24:10,557
Why don't you hand the rest over
to us?

387
01:24:14,367 --> 01:24:16,961
After prison
you'll get it back with interest.

388
01:24:40,087 --> 01:24:42,555
I warned you.

389
01:25:41,687 --> 01:25:44,042
SUICIDE

390
01:27:41,487 --> 01:27:43,523
Shove him in and close the door.

391
01:29:36,207 --> 01:29:37,959
I saw them...

392
01:29:38,767 --> 01:29:40,359
the yakuza corpses...

393
01:29:48,687 --> 01:29:50,962
Can you wait a moment?

394
01:30:00,647 --> 01:30:02,558
Just a moment.

395
01:30:31,567 --> 01:30:34,400
I could never live like that.

396
01:32:38,567 --> 01:32:40,319
