a ball is an indispensable blessing

-Will you take a dish of tea, ma'am?
-Green tea?

-Brown, Your Ladyship.
-Then no.

00:43:48,360 --> 00:43:54,833
At last. Lady Gresham and Mr Wisley
have come to call. Where have you been?

529
00:43:56,640 --> 00:43:58,073
Ma'am. Sir.

00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:04,037
Well, perhaps... Perhaps the young people
would like to take a walk?

531
00:44:04,120 --> 00:44:07,829

at the side of the house.

-What is she doing?
-Writing.

540
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:47,754
Indeed.

541
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:53,189
-The impression you have given me has always...
-The flowers particularly.

as Lady Gresham's heir,

-to which it may be indelicate to refer.
-Oh, indelicate, yes.

Mr Wisley...

548
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:25,709
Your offer is most sincere, I can see,
and gentlemanlike, and it honours me, truly.

that our circumstances are difficult, ma'am.

-There is no money for you.
-Surely something could be done.

What we can put by must go to your brothers.
You will have nothing, unless you marry.

Well, then, I will have nothing. For I will not
marry without affection, like my mother!

And now I have to dig my own damn potatoes!

Would you rather be a poor old maid?
Ridiculous, despised, the butt of jokes?

The legitimate sport of any village lout
with a stone and an impudent tongue?

-Eliza, my brother is much younger than you.
-And poorer.

He knows that I care for him sincerely.

588

I know that he is handsome...

589
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:15,758
And the handsome young men must have
something to live on as well as the plain.

590
00:49:15,840 --> 00:49:17,990
You encourage him to take you for money?

591

-Men do.
-That does not make it honourable.

that your Irish friend has no money, not a penny

596
00:49:34,560 --> 00:49:36,630
Consider that at the ball tonight.

to Bond Street where he can do no more harm.

TOM: You dance with passion.

605
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:57,909
No sensible woman would demonstrate passion
if the purpose were to attract a husband.

00:55:01,360 --> 00:55:03,476
-As opposed to a lover?
-Hmm.

-Ah, Miss Austen.
-Excuse me.

HENRY: This is unbearable.
My father is pressing for an early ordination,

613
00:56:10,800 --> 00:56:16,113
while my own inclination is to the scarlet of
a captaincy in His Majesty's regulars.

I do.

616
00:56:24,120 --> 00:56:29,478
-Well, that, of course is impossible.
-Oh, Henry, do not disguise yourself, not to me.

617
00:56:33,560 --> 00:56:37,189
The scarlet will suit you very well.

618
00:56:39,040 --> 00:56:42,555
Miss Austen? There you are.

619
00:56:52,520 --> 00:56:56,877
Miss Austen, I cannot believe I am obliged
to have this conversation.

00:57:00,800 --> 00:57:04,793
Mr Wisley's mother,
my own dear sister, died young.

622
00:57:05,960 --> 00:57:07,837
I have no children of my own.

623
00:57:08,880 --> 00:57:12,395
I hope you never come to understand
the pain of that condition.

624
00:57:14,120 --> 00:57:19,353
Let us simply say my nephew's wishes
are close to my heart,

625

But when a young woman such as yourself
receives the addresses

631
00:57:45,760 --> 00:57:51,073
from a gentleman such as my nephew,
it is her duty to accept at once.

632

But what do we find?

633
00:57:55,560 --> 00:57:57,471
-Independent thought?
-Exactly.

634
00:57:58,760 --> 00:58:04,039
My nephew, Miss Austen, condescends far indeed

635
00:58:04,320 --> 00:58:08,871
in offering to the daughter of an obscure
and impecunious clergyman.

636
00:58:08,960 --> 00:58:12,475
Impecunious? Your Ladyship is mistaken.

I am never mistaken.

Mr Wisley is a good opportunity for Jane.

642
00:58:47,720 --> 00:58:49,950

-Lucy, let us take some refreshments.
-What? Mother.

how can you, of all people,
dispose of yourself without affection?

651
00:59:49,680 --> 00:59:52,274
How can I dispose of myself with it?

652

-Very, very well.

01:03:01,800 --> 01:03:05,952
Oh. Saving your presence, ma'am.

691
01:03:06,040 --> 01:03:08,998
Be not afraid of abusing
the Jacobins on my account, Judge.

692
01:03:09,080 --> 01:03:12,834
-They guillotined my husband.
-Oh, savages. Beasts.

693
01:03:12,920 --> 01:03:15,036
-And his property?
-Confiscated.

694
01:03:15,760 --> 01:03:16,795
A disaster.

695
01:03:17,280 --> 01:03:20,477
Of course, by then,
much of my wealth was portable, so...

696
01:03:20,560 --> 01:03:21,993
(CHUCKLING)

697
01:03:22,400 --> 01:03:24,755
Yes, portable property
is happiness in a pocketbook.

698
01:03:24,840 --> 01:03:26,558
(LAUGHING)

699
01:03:28,440 --> 01:03:30,829
Do I detect you in irony?

700
01:03:34,960 --> 01:03:40,034
It is my considered opinion
that irony is insult with a smiling face.

701
01:03:40,440 --> 01:03:42,396
HENRY: (LAUGHING) Indeed.

702
01:03:43,480 --> 01:03:44,515
No.

703
01:03:46,560 --> 01:03:47,595
No?

704
01:03:49,040 --> 01:03:53,158
No, irony is the bringing together
of contradictory truths

705
01:03:53,600 --> 01:03:57,195
to make out of the contradiction a new truth
with a laugh or a smile,

706
01:03:57,280 --> 01:04:01,034
and I confess that a truth
must come with one or the other,

707
01:04:01,120 --> 01:04:05,671
or I account it as false and a denial
of the very nature of humanity itself.

708
01:04:09,040 --> 01:04:10,393
(CHUCKLES)

709
01:04:13,960 --> 01:04:16,349
My cousin is a writer.

710
01:04:17,840 --> 01:04:20,115
-Of what?
-Jane?

711
01:04:23,520 --> 01:04:24,555
Novels.

712
01:04:26,520 --> 01:04:28,954
A young woman of family?

713
01:04:30,600 --> 01:04:34,832
Yes, uncle, and tomorrow
we go and visit another, Mrs Radcliffe.

714
01:04:35,840 --> 01:04:39,230
She keeps herself to herself, almost a recluse,
but I know her husband through the law.

715
01:04:39,320 --> 01:04:42,630
-Who?
-The authoress, Mrs Radcliffe.

716
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:45,594
-As writing is her profession.
-Her what?

717
01:04:45,680 --> 01:04:48,274
£500, uncle, for the last novel,
The Mysteries of Udolpho.

718
01:04:48,360 --> 01:04:50,920
-And £800, I believe, for her next.
-The Italian.

719
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:53,036
Above £1,000?

720
01:04:55,560 --> 01:04:58,791
The times, the times.

721
01:05:12,080 --> 01:05:14,594
You live so quietly.

722
01:05:14,680 --> 01:05:19,037
And yet your novels are filled
with romance, danger, terror.

723
01:05:21,120 --> 01:05:22,951
Everything my life is not.

724
01:05:25,240 --> 01:05:26,355
Apparently.

725
01:05:27,120 --> 01:05:28,997
Of what do you wish to write?

726
01:05:31,560 --> 01:05:32,913
Of the heart.

727
01:05:34,040 --> 01:05:35,632
Do you know it?

728
01:05:36,760 --> 01:05:38,159
Not all of it.

729
01:05:39,280 --> 01:05:40,998
In time, you will.

730
01:05:41,840 --> 01:05:46,072
But even if that fails,
that's what the imagination is for.

731
01:05:50,120 --> 01:05:53,271
Your imagination has brought you independence.

732
01:05:55,040 --> 01:05:58,749
At a cost to myself and to my husband.

733
01:06:00,120 --> 01:06:01,314
Poor William.

734
01:06:02,280 --> 01:06:04,953
To have a wife who has a mind
is considered not quite proper.

735
01:06:05,040 --> 01:06:08,999
To have a wife with a literary reputation
nothing short of scandalous.

736
01:06:14,160 --> 01:06:16,116
But it must be possible?

737
01:06:17,120 --> 01:06:19,714
-To live as both wife and author?
-Oh.

738
01:06:20,680 --> 01:06:21,829
I think so.

739
01:06:23,800 --> 01:06:25,153
Though never easy.

740
01:06:45,120 --> 01:06:46,951
(SNORING)

741
01:07:02,160 --> 01:07:03,832
Could I really have this?

742
01:07:04,600 --> 01:07:06,079
What, precisely?

743
01:07:07,040 --> 01:07:08,314
(LAUGHS) You.

744
01:07:09,280 --> 01:07:10,474
Me, how?

745
01:07:12,360 --> 01:07:14,237
-This life with you.
-Yes.

746
01:07:16,360 --> 01:07:17,554
HENRY: Lefroy.

747
01:07:17,640 --> 01:07:19,790
-Hush. The judge.
-The man's like a rampant dog.

(SIGHS)

749
01:07:23,440 --> 01:07:26,000
He will be generous. I'm sure of it.

750
01:07:27,200 --> 01:07:29,555
-You'll speak with him?
-Tomorrow, I promise.

751
01:07:29,640 --> 01:07:31,835
I really must say good night.

752
01:07:32,560 --> 01:07:34,630
-Good night.
-Good night.

753
01:07:36,920 --> 01:07:39,593
-Miss Austen?
-Yes?

754
01:07:40,200 --> 01:07:41,553
Good night.

755
01:07:47,520 --> 01:07:52,116
You know, I think my mother is right.
A husband, and the sooner, the better.

756
01:08:29,680 --> 01:08:32,353
(BELL TOLLING)

757
01:08:35,400 --> 01:08:39,473
Five girls of little fortune.

violently in love can be supposed to do.

whom almost every female eye was turned.

01:10:10,160 --> 01:10:13,436
-Good morning, sir.
-Good morning?

01:10:17,680 --> 01:10:20,717
-Has the world turned topsy?
-Sir?

767
01:10:22,440 --> 01:10:25,318

-I'd hoped to discuss a certain matter.
-Your allowance is beyond negotiation.

771
01:10:43,320 --> 01:10:48,075
Now that you have had the opportunity
to become acquainted with Miss Austen yourself,

772
01:10:48,160 --> 01:10:52,551
I am sure you will find, as I do,
that she is a remarkable young woman.

(EXCLAIMS)

774
01:10:55,600 --> 01:10:58,114
-This is an outrage!
-If you will allow me to speak, sir.

775
01:10:58,200 --> 01:11:01,749
There is no need.
This letter makes it absolutely clear.

776
01:11:01,840 --> 01:11:02,875
Letter?

777
01:11:02,960 --> 01:11:06,077
Now I know what you were at down in Hampshire.

778
01:11:06,600 --> 01:11:08,272
-It is from Steventon.
-Is it true

779
01:11:08,360 --> 01:11:10,635
that you have practiced upon me with this chit?

780
01:11:10,720 --> 01:11:12,472
I wished you to know the young lady.

781
01:11:12,560 --> 01:11:14,516
I wished to introduce her
to your affections discreetly.

782
01:11:14,600 --> 01:11:21,119
Aye! Blind me with the rich widow and then
insinuate that penniless little husband-hunter!

783
01:11:21,200 --> 01:11:24,875
-Moderation, sir, I beg you!
-That ironical little authoress.

784
01:11:24,960 --> 01:11:27,394
I wished you to know her for yourself.

785
01:11:27,960 --> 01:11:30,679
I was certain her merit would speak for her.

-Consider, sir, my happiness is in your hands.
-Happiness?

Damn it, nephew,

788
01:11:38,560 --> 01:11:42,235
I had rather you were a whore-mongering
blackguard with a chance of reform

789
01:11:42,320 --> 01:11:45,949
than a love-sick whelp sunk in a bad marriage.

790
01:12:01,080 --> 01:12:03,799
My uncle has refused to give his consent.

-Who sent it?

Lady Gresham?

793
01:12:13,920 --> 01:12:15,239
Or her nephew.

794
01:12:23,560 --> 01:12:27,473
They think that they can do what they like
with us, but I will not accept this.

795
01:12:27,560 --> 01:12:29,278
We have no choice.

796
01:12:30,320 --> 01:12:31,833
Of course we do.

797
01:12:35,480 --> 01:12:36,549
I...

798
01:12:43,400 --> 01:12:46,472
I depend entirely upon...

Mmm.

801
01:12:58,160 --> 01:12:59,912
And I depend on you.

802
01:13:06,280 --> 01:13:08,077
So what will you do?

803
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:12,399
What I must.

804
01:13:13,280 --> 01:13:17,558
I have a duty to my family, Jane.
I must think of them as well as...

805
01:13:17,640 --> 01:13:18,675
Tom...

806
01:13:22,400 --> 01:13:25,312
Is that... Is that all you have to say to me?

807
01:13:41,320 --> 01:13:42,912
Goodbye, Mr Lefroy.

808
01:14:35,680 --> 01:14:39,389
The sentence of this court is that you be taken
to the place whence you came

809
01:14:39,480 --> 01:14:42,756
and thence to a place of execution,

810
01:14:43,240 --> 01:14:47,791
and that you be there hanged by the neck
until you are dead.

811
01:14:48,720 --> 01:14:51,393
May the Lord have mercy on your soul.

812
01:15:00,360 --> 01:15:01,509
Next.

813
01:15:13,720 --> 01:15:16,359
He has behaved so ill to you, Jane.

814
01:15:21,640 --> 01:15:24,598
Perhaps soon we can return home to Steventon.

815
01:15:26,800 --> 01:15:28,791
Is there any news of Robert?

816
01:15:35,200 --> 01:15:37,395
He has arrived in San Domingo at last.

817
01:15:37,480 --> 01:15:38,595
Good.

818
01:15:40,640 --> 01:15:41,675
Good.

819
01:16:05,560 --> 01:16:07,869
Glass of wine with you, sir?

820
01:16:09,480 --> 01:16:10,515
Yes.

821
01:16:11,080 --> 01:16:14,231
Yes, a toast from one member
of the profession to another.

822
01:17:26,760 --> 01:17:30,070
I'm sorry to have been so disobliging in the past.

823
01:17:35,720 --> 01:17:37,153
Mr Wisley?

824
01:17:42,680 --> 01:17:46,116
So, the infamous Mrs Radcliffe.

825
01:17:46,600 --> 01:17:49,273
Was she really as gothic as her novels?

826
01:17:52,120 --> 01:17:54,236
Not in externals,

827
01:17:54,320 --> 01:17:57,153
but her inner landscape is quite picturesque,
I suspect.

828
01:17:57,240 --> 01:17:58,719
True of us all.

829
01:18:55,360 --> 01:18:57,828
(WHISPERING) There's a message
for Reverend Austen.

830
01:19:02,080 --> 01:19:05,595
-(WHISPERING) Message for Reverend Austen.
-Thank you.

832
01:19:47,200 --> 01:19:48,553
What is it?

(SOBBING)

834
01:20:22,760 --> 01:20:25,274
(GASPING)

835
01:20:47,320 --> 01:20:50,835
It seemed he died very soon
after landing in San Domingo.

836
01:20:51,120 --> 01:20:53,270
My God, he was hardly there.

837
01:20:54,200 --> 01:20:56,031
What was the disease?

838
01:20:57,280 --> 01:21:00,909
Yellow fever. Lord Craven, he wrote.

839
01:21:01,320 --> 01:21:04,471
He said that if he had known
he was engaged to be married,

840
01:21:04,560 --> 01:21:06,755
he would never have taken him.

841
01:21:13,560 --> 01:21:16,199
Jane, there's something else.

842
01:21:17,880 --> 01:21:20,110
Mr Lefroy, Tom.

843
01:21:22,160 --> 01:21:23,195
What?

844
01:21:23,960 --> 01:21:26,838
I would keep this from you if I could.

845
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:29,833
He's here visiting Mrs Lefroy and I...

846
01:21:29,960 --> 01:21:31,552
He is engaged.

847
01:21:41,640 --> 01:21:42,789
So soon?

848
01:22:15,040 --> 01:22:16,234
A letter?

849
01:22:18,480 --> 01:22:19,595
No.

850
01:22:20,120 --> 01:22:22,634
It's something I began in London.

851
01:22:26,840 --> 01:22:29,752
It is the tale of a young woman.

852
01:22:30,440 --> 01:22:32,032
Two young women.

853
01:22:34,280 --> 01:22:36,236
Better than their circumstances.

854
01:22:36,640 --> 01:22:38,073
So many are.

855
01:22:38,160 --> 01:22:40,993
And two young gentlemen who receive

856
01:22:41,480 --> 01:22:44,631
much better than their deserts
as so very many do.

857
01:22:46,680 --> 01:22:47,874
Mmm.

858
01:22:52,080 --> 01:22:53,798
How does the story begin?

859
01:22:54,360 --> 01:22:55,793
-Badly.
-And then?

860
01:22:55,880 --> 01:22:57,472
It gets worse.

861
01:22:59,160 --> 01:23:00,991
With, I hope, some humour.

862
01:23:06,640 --> 01:23:08,198
How does it end?

863
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:16,389
They both make triumphant, happy endings.

864
01:23:18,560 --> 01:23:20,152
Brilliant marriages?

865
01:23:21,240 --> 01:23:23,470
Incandescent marriages

866
01:23:25,040 --> 01:23:26,678
to very rich men.

867
01:23:39,160 --> 01:23:42,516
You asked me a question.

868
01:23:43,480 --> 01:23:47,951
I am ready to give you an answer.
But there is one matter to be settled.

869
01:23:51,560 --> 01:23:53,710
I cannot make you out, Mr Wisley.

870
01:23:55,680 --> 01:23:57,318
At times, you are

871
01:23:58,240 --> 01:24:01,232
the most gentlemanlike man I know
and yet you would...

872
01:24:01,320 --> 01:24:03,959
"Yet". What a sad word.

873
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:09,630
And yet, you write yourself
most tellingly to great effect.

874
01:24:11,040 --> 01:24:14,237
-I'm speaking, of course, of your letter.
-What letter?

875
01:24:14,320 --> 01:24:17,437
Was your aunt the correspondent on your behalf?

876
01:24:19,400 --> 01:24:20,799
What matter?

877
01:24:21,760 --> 01:24:24,115
One way or another,
passion makes fools of us all.

878
01:24:24,200 --> 01:24:26,509
I hope, in time,
passion may regain your better opinion.

879
01:24:26,600 --> 01:24:28,477
The emotion is absurd.

880
01:24:29,400 --> 01:24:32,153
When you consider
the sex to whom it is often directed,

881
01:24:32,240 --> 01:24:34,515
indistinguishable from folly.

882
01:24:36,440 --> 01:24:40,399
I thank you for the honour of your proposal.
I accept. Good day.

883
01:25:06,320 --> 01:25:07,799
George, George.

884
01:25:08,440 --> 01:25:11,830
Mr Wisley is... He's an honourable man.

885
01:25:11,920 --> 01:25:13,990
You'll always have a place with me.

888
01:25:22,880 --> 01:25:24,359
Mr Lefroy.

889
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:34,115
Sir.

890
01:25:38,240 --> 01:25:41,550
I believe I must congratulate you, Mr Lefroy.

891
01:25:43,200 --> 01:25:47,034
And you've come to visit an old friend
at such a time. How considerate.

892
01:25:53,280 --> 01:25:56,317
I have come

893
01:25:56,400 --> 01:25:59,198
to offer an explanation, belatedly,

894
01:26:00,280 --> 01:26:04,068
for my conduct. I cannot think how to describe it.

895
01:26:04,160 --> 01:26:06,628
Tell me about your lady, Mr Lefroy.

896
01:26:07,880 --> 01:26:09,871
From where does she come?

897
01:26:11,840 --> 01:26:13,910
She's from County Wexford.

898
01:26:14,280 --> 01:26:17,158
Your own country. Excellent.

899
01:26:19,480 --> 01:26:24,679
What was it that won her?
Your manner, smiles and pleasing address?

900
01:26:30,360 --> 01:26:33,193
No, no, not at all.

901
01:26:33,360 --> 01:26:39,629
No, had I really experienced that emotion,
I should, at present, detest the very sight of him.

902
01:26:39,720 --> 01:26:41,517
And you are mistaken.

903
01:26:41,600 --> 01:26:45,912
I'm even impartial towards
the gloriously endowed Miss Wexford...

904
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:47,592
I cannot do this.

905
01:26:57,160 --> 01:26:59,276
And so you would marry Wisley?

906
01:27:04,560 --> 01:27:06,232
(WHISPERS) Please?

907
01:27:09,280 --> 01:27:13,159
If there is a shred of truth
or justice inside of you,

908
01:27:13,240 --> 01:27:15,356
-you cannot marry him.
-Oh no, Mr Lefroy.

909
01:27:15,440 --> 01:27:18,273
Justice, by your own admission,
you know little of, truth even less.

910
01:27:18,360 --> 01:27:22,751
Jane, I have tried.
I have tried and I cannot live this lie.

911
01:27:23,720 --> 01:27:24,948
Can you?

912
01:27:26,040 --> 01:27:28,315
Jane, can you?

913
01:27:32,240 --> 01:27:35,710
What value will there be in life
if we are not together?

914
01:27:42,880 --> 01:27:44,677
Run away with me.

915
01:27:47,120 --> 01:27:48,758
An elopement?

916
01:27:49,680 --> 01:27:51,910
That is exactly what I propose.

917
01:27:52,960 --> 01:27:57,397
We'll post to London,
by Friday be in Scotland, and man and wife.

918
01:27:59,800 --> 01:28:02,155
-Leave everything?
-Everything.

919
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:05,389
It is the only way we can be together.

920
01:28:24,600 --> 01:28:26,556
You'll lose everything.

921
01:28:27,200 --> 01:28:31,478
Family, place. For what?

922
01:28:31,880 --> 01:28:34,519
A lifetime of drudgery on a pittance?

923
01:28:35,200 --> 01:28:38,431
A child every year
and no means to lighten the load?

924
01:28:38,720 --> 01:28:41,632
-How will you write, Jane?
-I do not know.

925
01:28:42,040 --> 01:28:44,838
But happiness is within my grasp
and I cannot help myself.

926
01:28:44,920 --> 01:28:46,956
There is no sense in this.

927
01:28:51,120 --> 01:28:55,432
If you could have your Robert back, even like this,

928
01:28:56,480 --> 01:28:58,072
would you do it?

Come. If we hurry,
we can still make the morning coach.

-Not yet.

-Yes?
-Right you are, sir.

1040
01:42:23,400 --> 01:42:27,188
to someone without family, fortune, importance

1041
01:42:28,040 --> 01:42:31,316
and fatally tainted by suspicion.

1042
01:42:31,400 --> 01:42:36,349
-Oh, she has family, madam.
-REVEREND AUSTEN: Indeed she has.

1043
01:42:37,600 --> 01:42:41,798
Importance may depend upon other matters
than Your Ladyship can conceive.

1044
01:42:42,880 --> 01:42:46,395
As to fortune, a young woman
might depend upon herself.

1045
01:42:48,720 --> 01:42:51,109
An interesting notion, Miss Austen.

1046
01:42:52,560 --> 01:42:53,709
(EXCLAIMING)

1047
01:42:58,040 --> 01:43:01,919
Oblige me a walk along the river
to enlarge upon the topic.

1048
01:43:04,120 --> 01:43:05,348
Wisley?

1049
01:43:12,800 --> 01:43:17,555
I am sorry if my conduct
has disappointed you, Mr Wisley.

1050
01:43:18,720 --> 01:43:22,554
It seems you cannot bring yourself
to marry without affection.

1051
01:43:22,640 --> 01:43:24,278
Or even with it.

1052
01:43:25,760 --> 01:43:29,719
I respect you for that
and share your opinion. Neither can I.

1053
01:43:32,320 --> 01:43:35,278
I'd always hoped to win your love in time,

1054
01:43:35,360 --> 01:43:38,989
but I am vain enough to want to be loved
for myself rather than my money.

1055
01:43:39,080 --> 01:43:40,991
Do we part as friends?

1056
01:43:42,920 --> 01:43:44,273
We do.

1057
01:43:47,400 --> 01:43:49,914
-So, you will live...
-By my pen. Yes.

1058
01:43:54,200 --> 01:43:57,158
Will all your stories have happy endings?

1059
01:43:57,840 --> 01:43:59,671
My characters will have,

1060
01:44:00,280 --> 01:44:02,475
after a little bit of trouble,

1061
01:44:03,840 --> 01:44:05,910
all that they desire.

1062
01:44:08,200 --> 01:44:10,998
The good do not always come to good ends.

1063
01:44:13,400 --> 01:44:16,073
It is a truth universally acknowledged.

1064
01:44:17,360 --> 01:44:20,158
JANE: "... that a single man
in possession of a good fortune

1065
01:44:20,240 --> 01:44:21,958
"must be in want of a wife. "

1066

(ALL CHEERING)

1067
01:44:25,080 --> 01:44:28,038
"However little known the feelings
or views of such a man may be

1068
01:44:28,120 --> 01:44:30,395
"on his first entering a neighbourhood,

1069
01:44:30,480 --> 01:44:34,268
"this truth is so well fixed
in the minds of the surrounding families,

1070
01:44:36,040 --> 01:44:40,318
"that he is considered as the rightful property
of some one or other of their daughters.

1071
01:44:40,400 --> 01:44:43,472
"'My dear Mr Bennet, '
said his lady to him, one day,

1072
01:44:43,560 --> 01:44:46,472
"'Have you heard
that Netherfield Park is let at last? '

1073
01:44:46,560 --> 01:44:48,835
"Mr Bennet replied that he had not.

1074
01:44:48,920 --> 01:44:51,309
"'But it is, ' returned she... "

(WOMAN SINGING OPERA)

1076
01:46:39,280 --> 01:46:42,113
Is it Miss Austen? The Miss Austen?

1077
01:46:42,200 --> 01:46:45,510
No, Madam. That courtesy,
according to the customs of precedence,

1078
01:46:45,600 --> 01:46:47,511
belongs to my elder sister.

1079
01:46:47,600 --> 01:46:51,195
Miss Jane Austen,
the authoress of Pride and Prejudice?

1080
01:46:51,280 --> 01:46:55,273
My sister wishes to remain anonymous,
but your kind regard is much appreciated.

1081
01:46:55,360 --> 01:46:57,157
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

1082
01:47:29,640 --> 01:47:31,437
Please, come through.

1083
01:47:32,560 --> 01:47:33,959
I shall never forgive Henry for this.

1084
01:47:34,040 --> 01:47:37,032
Yes, you will.
We always forgive him for everything.

1085
01:47:41,640 --> 01:47:43,949
Jane, an old friend.

1086
01:47:44,840 --> 01:47:46,432
Late as ever.

1087
01:47:48,200 --> 01:47:50,555
Madame le Comtesse, Miss Austen.

1088
01:47:52,920 --> 01:47:54,319
Mr Lefroy.

1089
01:48:01,760 --> 01:48:03,637
Please allow me to introduce to you

1090
01:48:03,720 --> 01:48:08,350
your most avid of admirers,
my daughter, Miss Lefroy.

1091
01:48:10,000 --> 01:48:12,992
Miss Austen, what a pleasure to meet you.

1092
01:48:15,320 --> 01:48:17,629
Will you read for us this evening?

1093
01:48:17,720 --> 01:48:20,188
Ah, well, you see, my sister never reads.

1094
01:48:20,280 --> 01:48:23,238
Otherwise, how else is she
supposed to remain anonymous?

1095
01:48:23,320 --> 01:48:24,799
-But...
-Jane.

1096
01:48:32,440 --> 01:48:34,396
I will make an exception

1097
01:48:35,200 --> 01:48:37,270
if my new friend wishes it.

1098
01:48:39,480 --> 01:48:41,152
Come, sit by me.

1099
01:48:52,320 --> 01:48:54,072
She is lovely, Tom.

1100
01:48:56,040 --> 01:48:57,837
"She began now to comprehend

1101
01:48:59,040 --> 01:49:02,510
"that he was exactly the man who,
in disposition and talents,

1102
01:49:03,040 --> 01:49:04,712
"would most suit her.

1103
01:49:05,600 --> 01:49:08,910
"His understanding and temper,
though unlike her own,

1104
01:49:09,280 --> 01:49:11,794
"would have answered all her wishes.

1105
01:49:13,800 --> 01:49:17,395
"It was an union that must have been
to the advantage of both.

1106
01:49:17,480 --> 01:49:19,516
"By her ease and liveliness,

1107
01:49:19,600 --> 01:49:23,115
"his mind might have been softened,
his manners improved,

1108
01:49:23,640 --> 01:49:28,475
"and from his judgment,
information and knowledge of the world,

1109
01:49:29,640 --> 01:49:33,076
"she must have received benefit
of greater importance.

1110
01:49:34,360 --> 01:49:38,319
"But no such happy marriage
could now teach the admiring multitude

1111
01:49:40,000 --> 01:49:43,390
"what connubial felicity really was."
