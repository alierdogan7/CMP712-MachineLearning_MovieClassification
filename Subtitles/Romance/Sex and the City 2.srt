without my gals.

00:51:39,930 --> 00:51:42,296
- What?
- I told the sheikh I'd go on one condition:

891
00:51:42,599 --> 00:51:44,931
I'd get to bring my three best girlfriends.

892
00:51:45,102 --> 00:51:46,899
- Get out of town.
- My point exactly.

...and then we had that great night?
- Mm-hm.

Hear me out.

00:54:59,529 --> 00:55:03,898
After you took those two days
at your old apartment, I started thinking:

00:55:04,067 --> 00:55:05,466
What if I got a place?

948
00:55:06,169 --> 00:55:10,071
- You want your own apartment?
- No, not my own apartment.

...I'd be here and available
for dinners and sparkle or whatever.

two days off a week from our marriage.

Can you honestly tell me you didn't enjoy
those two days to yourself?

961
00:55:45,475 --> 00:55:49,411
Two days, yes,
but I don't need it every week.

I thought we were supposed to be
making up our own rules.

966
00:56:10,300 --> 00:56:15,169
So two days, then four days,
then what, no days?

967
00:56:15,338 --> 00:56:19,001
- Is that where this is heading?
- I never would've brought it up if I thought...

Well, something is.

"Big and I are taking two days a week off...

They'd never understand.
