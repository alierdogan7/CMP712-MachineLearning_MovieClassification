1
00:00:32,287 --> 00:00:33,640
What ya doing over there?

2
00:00:34,447 --> 00:00:35,641
l have to go.

3
00:00:37,887 --> 00:00:39,036
Why?

4
00:00:39,647 --> 00:00:40,841
Ajob.

5
00:00:44,967 --> 00:00:46,400
Funny hours.

6
00:00:47,127 --> 00:00:48,446
Funny job.

7
00:00:50,007 --> 00:00:51,201
Will l see you again?

8
00:00:51,767 --> 00:00:52,836
No.

9
00:00:55,207 --> 00:00:57,437
You weren't wearing
that earlier, were you?

10
00:00:59,287 --> 00:01:01,278
-l brought it.
-Thank God!

11
00:01:02,727 --> 00:01:04,160
You look like a creep.

12
00:01:11,607 --> 00:01:13,325
You have great hands.

13
00:03:06,887 --> 00:03:09,401
-How am l doing, Tommy?
-Two minutes, Jack.

14
00:03:17,807 --> 00:03:19,604
You're giving me an ulcer, Jack.

15
00:03:19,767 --> 00:03:20,995
l am early.

16
00:03:22,567 --> 00:03:25,127
45 seconds
does not qualify as early, Jack.

17
00:03:25,287 --> 00:03:28,120
-Who does your tuxedo these days?
-Moon.

18
00:03:28,287 --> 00:03:30,881
Well, go to China Boy.
Look like you crawled out of bed.

19
00:03:32,607 --> 00:03:35,565
''Be the envy of your friends
with Miracle Hair''?

20
00:03:37,247 --> 00:03:38,566
This is paint, Frank.

21
00:03:38,727 --> 00:03:42,606
No, it's a magical sheath that
simulates a dazzling head of hair.

22
00:03:43,847 --> 00:03:46,919
-Frank, this is paint!
-Just help me put it on.

23
00:03:47,447 --> 00:03:49,438
You're supposed to spray
in a circular motion.

24
00:04:06,447 --> 00:04:08,199
Thank you.

25
00:04:08,367 --> 00:04:11,040
Good evening and welcome
to the Starfire Lounge.

26
00:04:11,247 --> 00:04:13,124
My name is Frank Baker.

27
00:04:14,167 --> 00:04:16,476
88 keys across from me
is my little brother, Jack.

28
00:04:16,647 --> 00:04:19,844
My brother and l have been
playing together for how long, Jack?

29
00:04:20,807 --> 00:04:21,796
31 years.

30
00:04:22,327 --> 00:04:24,477
That's a lot of water
under the bridge, huh, Jack?

31
00:04:25,647 --> 00:04:26,966
A lot of water.

32
00:04:27,167 --> 00:04:30,603
Things were different then.
l was 1 1 , Jack was 7.

33
00:04:30,807 --> 00:04:33,560
The only one who'd listen to us
was the family cat, Cecil.

34
00:04:35,487 --> 00:04:38,559
We must have shaved 3 lives
off that cat, huh, Jack?

35
00:04:41,247 --> 00:04:43,886
But seriously, it's been
15 years since Jack and l

36
00:04:44,047 --> 00:04:46,117
stepped on stage as professionals.

37
00:04:46,447 --> 00:04:49,564
But though we've played some
of the finest venues in the world,

38
00:04:49,727 --> 00:04:53,606
there's always been
a very special place for us.

39
00:04:55,447 --> 00:04:58,723
That place is this place.
The Starfire Lounge.

40
00:04:59,367 --> 00:05:00,516
Why?

41
00:05:01,327 --> 00:05:03,443
l guess you could just say...

42
00:05:04,327 --> 00:05:05,476
the people.

43
00:05:29,287 --> 00:05:32,962
Terrific, boys, terrific.
Yes, sir!

44
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:35,762
You're just what we needed
on a night like this.

45
00:05:36,487 --> 00:05:37,602
Thanks, Lloyd.

46
00:05:37,967 --> 00:05:39,844
Only Jack, do me a favor?

47
00:05:40,447 --> 00:05:43,120
lf you want to smoke on stage,
put on a pair of sunglasses

48
00:05:43,287 --> 00:05:45,403
and go play with
the niggers on State Street.

49
00:05:47,847 --> 00:05:50,998
Here you go, fellas.
Ought to buy you more lessons.

50
00:05:51,687 --> 00:05:54,121
Do you know when you'd
want us to come back?

51
00:05:54,287 --> 00:05:55,436
l'll call you.

52
00:05:57,007 --> 00:05:59,237
l thought,
the way our schedule is,

53
00:05:59,407 --> 00:06:01,443
it might be a good idea...

54
00:06:02,007 --> 00:06:03,235
l'll call you.

55
00:06:06,167 --> 00:06:08,123
Count it.
Count it!

56
00:06:08,367 --> 00:06:09,322
Jack!

57
00:06:09,567 --> 00:06:11,398
Count the fucking money, Frank.

58
00:06:13,207 --> 00:06:14,560
lt's all here.

59
00:06:17,847 --> 00:06:19,200
l'll be talking to you, Lloyd.

60
00:06:21,047 --> 00:06:22,560
Very nice, Jack. Very nice.

61
00:06:22,727 --> 00:06:24,001
Fuck him.

62
00:06:24,247 --> 00:06:27,205
This isn't the Pine Tree lnn
on Route 81.

63
00:06:27,607 --> 00:06:30,075
-Fuck him.
-Terrific. Fuck him.

64
00:06:32,927 --> 00:06:34,645
-Are we on for tomorrow night?
-Maybe Thursday.

65
00:06:36,927 --> 00:06:39,680
l hear the harpist
at the Sheraton has appendicitis.

66
00:06:44,647 --> 00:06:45,716
Hey!

67
00:06:47,167 --> 00:06:48,725
Don't forget your hair.

68
00:07:04,367 --> 00:07:07,006
l think l'm ready for
''Oh What Fun it is to Ride''.

69
00:07:10,007 --> 00:07:11,679
Your mom got a new friend?

70
00:07:14,607 --> 00:07:15,926
Uh-huh.

71
00:07:16,127 --> 00:07:17,276
Sounds big. What's he do?

72
00:07:17,927 --> 00:07:21,317
Kind of like a lawyer,
but the hours are more regular.

73
00:07:22,207 --> 00:07:25,438
All l know is, one day
he came to take the TV away,

74
00:07:25,967 --> 00:07:27,320
and ended up staying for dinner.

75
00:07:28,047 --> 00:07:29,924
What happened to
the Donut King?

76
00:07:30,687 --> 00:07:31,836
Married.

77
00:07:35,367 --> 00:07:37,756
No breakfast.
Maybe they had a fight.

78
00:07:38,127 --> 00:07:39,276
Nina!

79
00:07:39,967 --> 00:07:41,480
Gotta go. Teach me later?

80
00:07:45,967 --> 00:07:47,082
l'm coming!

81
00:07:47,247 --> 00:07:49,442
Are you bothering
Mr. Baker again?

82
00:07:49,607 --> 00:07:50,756
No, Mom.

83
00:07:52,327 --> 00:07:53,043
Hey!

84
00:07:53,647 --> 00:07:54,636
Get up.

85
00:08:35,527 --> 00:08:37,643
Thank you Mahalu.
That concludes this evening's show.

86
00:08:37,807 --> 00:08:40,765
Jack and l hope you enjoyed
yourselves as much as we did.

87
00:08:41,207 --> 00:08:42,196
And...

88
00:08:47,367 --> 00:08:49,403
which means
''Paddle home safely.''

89
00:08:56,727 --> 00:08:58,080
You want to see me, Charlie.

90
00:08:58,567 --> 00:09:00,398
Frankie! Yeah, come on in.

91
00:09:02,447 --> 00:09:04,722
-Little slow tonight.
-Mondays.

92
00:09:04,927 --> 00:09:07,282
-How is Jack?
-Okay.

93
00:09:07,927 --> 00:09:09,883
l wanted to see you alone because...

94
00:09:11,407 --> 00:09:14,399
The kitchen help, maids,
they love him. He makes me nervous.

95
00:09:14,647 --> 00:09:16,444
Sometimes he makes me nervous.

96
00:09:17,847 --> 00:09:19,121
Well, anyway...

97
00:09:22,007 --> 00:09:23,679
-What is this?
-Your pay.

98
00:09:26,287 --> 00:09:27,356
What about tomorrow night?

99
00:09:27,847 --> 00:09:29,565
lt's all there. Both nights.

100
00:09:29,927 --> 00:09:31,246
What are you saying, Charlie?

101
00:09:33,807 --> 00:09:36,446
You and Jack have been
working here a long time.

102
00:09:36,807 --> 00:09:37,876
12 years.

103
00:09:38,367 --> 00:09:40,881
Maybe it's time we took
a vacation from one another.

104
00:09:41,767 --> 00:09:43,120
Vacation?

105
00:09:43,287 --> 00:09:46,120
Come on, it's Monday night!
You said so yourself.

106
00:09:46,287 --> 00:09:47,959
l got the pianos for two nights.

107
00:09:48,567 --> 00:09:50,478
lt wasn't even half full
out there tonight.

108
00:09:50,647 --> 00:09:53,400
l have six waiters in the back
listening to basketball.

109
00:09:53,567 --> 00:09:54,886
l gotta move the liquor.

110
00:09:55,047 --> 00:09:58,198
So, l have to fill the tables.
lt's a matter of economics.

111
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:03,402
l love you guys.
You're class.

112
00:10:03,967 --> 00:10:05,195
But people today...

113
00:10:05,687 --> 00:10:07,086
they don't know class

114
00:10:07,247 --> 00:10:10,239
if it walks up and
grabs them by the balls.

115
00:10:23,447 --> 00:10:25,961
15 years, no one's paid us off.

116
00:10:26,207 --> 00:10:28,437
He made the deal.
There's no shame in it.

117
00:10:32,327 --> 00:10:33,555
We gotta talk.

118
00:10:34,247 --> 00:10:35,236
Talk!

119
00:10:36,727 --> 00:10:39,036
l've been thinking maybe
we should make some changes.

120
00:10:41,007 --> 00:10:43,157
Maybe we should take on a singer.

121
00:10:46,807 --> 00:10:48,763
lt's just an idea.
l want your opinion.

122
00:10:51,367 --> 00:10:53,119
We go half on everything, right?

123
00:10:53,367 --> 00:10:55,597
l wouldn't say
exactly half, would you?

124
00:10:55,767 --> 00:10:58,565
We agreed it l did the business,
l'd be entitled to a little extra.

125
00:10:58,727 --> 00:11:01,605
-ls that what we agreed?
-Yeah, that's what we agreed.

126
00:11:01,927 --> 00:11:02,962
lf you're unhappy...

127
00:11:03,127 --> 00:11:04,765
-l'm not unhappy.
-lf you want to...

128
00:11:04,927 --> 00:11:07,236
assume more of the financial
responsibility, l'd be glad.

129
00:11:07,407 --> 00:11:08,920
How much for the singer?

130
00:11:09,127 --> 00:11:12,802
20ª/º. With additional bookings,
we'll come out ahead.

131
00:11:14,287 --> 00:11:15,276
What?

132
00:11:18,527 --> 00:11:20,836
Two pianos isn't enough anymore.

133
00:11:21,487 --> 00:11:22,681
Never was.

134
00:11:25,367 --> 00:11:27,244
l appreciate your punctuality,
Miss...

135
00:11:27,407 --> 00:11:29,557
Moran.
Monica Moran.

136
00:11:29,767 --> 00:11:31,166
Alright, Miss Moran.

137
00:11:31,327 --> 00:11:33,636
Actually,
that's my stage name.

138
00:11:33,807 --> 00:11:36,162
-l'm sorry.
-Monica Moran.

139
00:11:36,327 --> 00:11:40,206
That's my stage name.
My real name is Blanche.

140
00:11:40,847 --> 00:11:41,996
Blanche?

141
00:11:42,407 --> 00:11:43,886
No romance, right?

142
00:11:44,167 --> 00:11:47,318
That's why l came up with Monica.
lt's what l prefer.

143
00:11:47,487 --> 00:11:48,806
Well, that's alright.

144
00:11:49,927 --> 00:11:52,600
But if you call my house
and my mother answers,

145
00:11:52,967 --> 00:11:54,241
ask for Blanche.

146
00:11:54,407 --> 00:11:57,877
lf not, she'll think you have
the wrong number and hang up.

147
00:12:01,767 --> 00:12:04,235
Yes, well. What is it
you'd like to do for us?

148
00:12:05,807 --> 00:12:08,640
''The Candy Man''.
ls that all right?

149
00:12:09,127 --> 00:12:10,526
That's one of Jack's favorites.

150
00:12:13,167 --> 00:12:15,317
l almost forgot you were there.

151
00:12:16,167 --> 00:12:18,078
Here's the instructions.

152
00:12:19,287 --> 00:12:20,436
He knows it.

153
00:12:20,727 --> 00:12:24,037
Really?
lsn't that a coincidence?

154
00:12:25,287 --> 00:12:26,515
Small world.

155
00:12:29,127 --> 00:12:30,276
Shall we?

156
00:13:03,047 --> 00:13:04,446
Thank you, that's enough.

157
00:13:06,007 --> 00:13:07,156
Miss Moran!

158
00:13:07,367 --> 00:13:08,083
Miss Moran!

159
00:13:12,687 --> 00:13:13,483
Blanche!

160
00:13:16,087 --> 00:13:17,156
Sorry.

161
00:13:17,367 --> 00:13:20,484
l get so
caught up in it sometimes.

162
00:13:20,687 --> 00:13:22,200
lt's scary.

163
00:13:22,447 --> 00:13:23,675
Yes, it is.

164
00:13:25,847 --> 00:13:27,917
Well, okay. Thank you.

165
00:14:20,967 --> 00:14:23,879
37 girls and not one
who can carry a tune.

166
00:14:26,647 --> 00:14:29,480
There was a certain
surreal quality to it.

167
00:14:31,607 --> 00:14:33,120
God damn it!

168
00:14:33,647 --> 00:14:34,875
Shit!

169
00:14:35,567 --> 00:14:36,920
Shoe.

170
00:14:42,527 --> 00:14:44,324
ls this where the auditions are?

171
00:14:44,487 --> 00:14:47,285
Where the auditions were.
We're finished.

172
00:14:48,487 --> 00:14:49,476
What about me?

173
00:14:50,127 --> 00:14:51,685
You're an hour and a half late.

174
00:14:52,167 --> 00:14:54,965
l had trouble catching a cab.

175
00:14:57,567 --> 00:15:01,162
Punctuality,
first rule of show business.

176
00:15:01,847 --> 00:15:03,360
This is show business?

177
00:15:05,567 --> 00:15:07,523
Look Miss, we're tired,

178
00:15:08,007 --> 00:15:10,396
you have gum on your lip
and we're going home.

179
00:15:13,047 --> 00:15:14,162
Just like that, huh?

180
00:15:14,927 --> 00:15:17,487
l come down here,
break a heel

181
00:15:17,647 --> 00:15:21,560
and you won't give me a chance
because l'm a little late!

182
00:15:21,727 --> 00:15:24,878
An hour an a half late.
Want me to say it again?

183
00:15:25,527 --> 00:15:27,518
Well, it's not exactly
bewitching me.

184
00:15:29,447 --> 00:15:31,324
Besides, you're not
going anywhere.

185
00:15:32,727 --> 00:15:33,716
l beg your pardon?

186
00:15:34,327 --> 00:15:37,558
lntuition. l had a hunch
about this all day.

187
00:15:37,727 --> 00:15:40,161
Only, in my mind,
it was a little more glamorous.

188
00:15:48,807 --> 00:15:50,877
So, where's the winner?

189
00:15:56,207 --> 00:15:58,596
See? lntuition.

190
00:15:59,887 --> 00:16:00,876
Jack...

191
00:16:05,247 --> 00:16:06,680
What have we got to lose?

192
00:16:09,807 --> 00:16:10,842
Terrific.

193
00:16:11,607 --> 00:16:12,722
38!

194
00:16:14,967 --> 00:16:17,845
What is that, ''38''?
Do you guys have a code?

195
00:16:21,887 --> 00:16:23,115
Name?

196
00:16:24,287 --> 00:16:25,640
Susie Diamond.

197
00:16:26,487 --> 00:16:27,556
Catchy.

198
00:16:28,167 --> 00:16:30,886
Do you have any previous
experience as a singer?

199
00:16:31,087 --> 00:16:32,076
No.

200
00:16:33,487 --> 00:16:35,637
Any entertainment experience?

201
00:16:36,927 --> 00:16:40,636
Last couple of years l've been
on call for Triple A Escort Service.

202
00:16:47,807 --> 00:16:50,321
What would you like to share?

203
00:16:52,087 --> 00:16:53,520
''More Than You Know''.

204
00:16:59,207 --> 00:17:00,481
Slow, okay?

205
00:18:28,047 --> 00:18:29,036
So?

206
00:18:35,007 --> 00:18:37,840
Did l not tell everyone: 7.15?

207
00:18:38,087 --> 00:18:40,965
-She'll get here.
-Like the day of the auctions.

208
00:18:41,287 --> 00:18:42,322
Jesus!

209
00:18:46,047 --> 00:18:47,116
How is my hair?

210
00:18:47,847 --> 00:18:49,075
Awe inspiring.

211
00:18:49,767 --> 00:18:52,042
Well, yours is not.
Let me run a comb through it.

212
00:18:52,207 --> 00:18:53,686
-Get out of here.
-Come on, stand still.

213
00:18:53,847 --> 00:18:55,565
lt won't hurt you.
Hold on.

214
00:18:55,727 --> 00:18:58,446
l'll hit you, l swear.

215
00:19:02,607 --> 00:19:05,280
-You hit me.
-l told you l was.

216
00:19:05,447 --> 00:19:07,119
l am a little wound up.

217
00:19:07,967 --> 00:19:10,959
-You're a fucking alarm clock.
-l just wish she'd get here.

218
00:19:11,127 --> 00:19:12,276
She's here.

219
00:19:15,327 --> 00:19:16,999
Christ. Look at her.

220
00:19:19,927 --> 00:19:21,883
Good evening, Miss Diamond.
You're late.

221
00:19:23,367 --> 00:19:26,484
Guest vocalist?
Who's next week, Beverly Sills?

222
00:19:26,647 --> 00:19:28,877
How come you guys have
your picture on the poster?

223
00:19:29,047 --> 00:19:30,924
We'll talk later. Your dress?

224
00:19:31,727 --> 00:19:32,796
What are you talking about?

225
00:19:32,967 --> 00:19:35,925
ls there a language problem?
Where's your dress for tonight?

226
00:19:36,327 --> 00:19:37,555
Do l look like l'm naked?

227
00:19:38,527 --> 00:19:39,562
With that?

228
00:19:40,127 --> 00:19:41,162
What are you, insane?

229
00:19:41,327 --> 00:19:43,158
Are you going trick or treating?

230
00:19:44,087 --> 00:19:46,647
-He doesn't like my dress, right?
-We don't have much time.

231
00:19:46,807 --> 00:19:49,605
What are you doing?
Don't grab me. Don't!

232
00:19:54,367 --> 00:19:56,039
-What are you, an eight?
-A six.

233
00:20:01,247 --> 00:20:02,600
How about this?

234
00:20:05,367 --> 00:20:06,595
Here. How is this?

235
00:20:25,007 --> 00:20:26,998
We'll take them from your share.

236
00:20:27,487 --> 00:20:28,556
You are a prince.

237
00:20:29,127 --> 00:20:32,597
Jack, touch me up, will you?
Remember, Jack and l are on first.

238
00:20:33,167 --> 00:20:34,885
l do the set-up and introduce you.

239
00:20:35,847 --> 00:20:36,996
And you say...?

240
00:20:37,167 --> 00:20:39,727
Good evening ladies and gentlemen,
l can't tell you... what is that?

241
00:20:40,207 --> 00:20:41,686
Winding your watch these days?

242
00:20:41,927 --> 00:20:44,202
-A little emergency, Ray.
-''Miracle Hair''.

243
00:20:44,367 --> 00:20:46,801
-Who is this, Minnie Pearl?
-We need some scissors.

244
00:20:46,967 --> 00:20:49,845
l want 75 minutes, Frankie.

245
00:20:50,007 --> 00:20:52,760
Don't worry,
they'll cut this off. Scissors!

246
00:20:53,367 --> 00:20:55,085
Fix your tie.

247
00:20:55,447 --> 00:20:57,438
Good luck, guys.
lt's a pretty ugly group.

248
00:20:57,607 --> 00:20:59,518
They send back the cheese balls.

249
00:20:59,807 --> 00:21:01,001
No scissors.

250
00:21:10,807 --> 00:21:11,796
Good evening.

251
00:21:12,047 --> 00:21:14,163
Welcome to the Ambassador Lounge.

252
00:21:14,567 --> 00:21:16,159
My name's Frank Baker.

253
00:21:16,767 --> 00:21:19,565
And no, you're not seeing double.
lt's just my brother, Jack.

254
00:21:27,367 --> 00:21:30,245
-Just a sip. For the butterflies.
-Okay, but no lipstick.

255
00:21:31,407 --> 00:21:32,886
What's that on your wrist?

256
00:21:33,327 --> 00:21:34,806
The next hour and a half
of my life.

257
00:21:34,967 --> 00:21:36,366
...a very special place.

258
00:21:37,047 --> 00:21:39,686
And that place is this place,

259
00:21:40,087 --> 00:21:41,520
the Ambassador Lounge.

260
00:21:41,967 --> 00:21:45,039
Please give a warm welcome
to a very special lady

261
00:21:45,207 --> 00:21:47,163
with a very special way
of singing a song.

262
00:21:47,327 --> 00:21:49,045
Miss Susie Diamond!

263
00:21:57,047 --> 00:21:58,480
Ladies and Gentlemen...

264
00:21:59,047 --> 00:22:01,641
-Hit the switch.
-Switch?

265
00:22:03,007 --> 00:22:04,565
What fucking switch?

266
00:22:07,647 --> 00:22:08,875
Pardon me.

267
00:22:11,167 --> 00:22:14,045
l can't tell you how
thrilled l am to be here.

268
00:22:25,967 --> 00:22:28,401
l work at the Palace Ballroom

269
00:22:28,967 --> 00:22:31,162
but gee, that palace is cheap.

270
00:22:32,247 --> 00:22:33,566
When I get home

271
00:22:33,727 --> 00:22:36,764
to my chilly old room

272
00:22:36,927 --> 00:22:40,522
l'm much too tired to sleep.

273
00:22:46,727 --> 00:22:49,958
l'm one of those lady teachers,

274
00:22:51,007 --> 00:22:53,885
a beautiful hostess, you know.

275
00:22:55,407 --> 00:22:58,638
One that the Palace features

276
00:22:59,527 --> 00:23:01,882
at exactly

277
00:23:02,807 --> 00:23:04,365
a dime a throw.

278
00:23:09,127 --> 00:23:11,846
Ten cents a dance,

279
00:23:12,007 --> 00:23:14,475
that's what they pay me.

280
00:23:15,287 --> 00:23:18,359
Gosh, how they weigh me down.

281
00:23:21,407 --> 00:23:23,443
Ten cents a dance,

282
00:23:24,567 --> 00:23:27,479
Pansies and wallflowers.

283
00:23:27,647 --> 00:23:32,118
Tough guys who tear my gown.

284
00:23:34,407 --> 00:23:37,046
7 to midnight,

285
00:23:37,207 --> 00:23:39,323
I hearthe drums.

286
00:23:40,207 --> 00:23:45,406
Loudly the saxophone blows.

287
00:23:46,007 --> 00:23:51,479
Trumpets are tearing
my eardrums.

288
00:23:52,247 --> 00:23:55,796
Customers crush my toes.

289
00:23:58,407 --> 00:24:00,637
Sometimes l think

290
00:24:01,567 --> 00:24:04,604
l have found my hero.

291
00:24:05,207 --> 00:24:09,041
But it's a queer romance.

292
00:24:10,847 --> 00:24:15,318
All that you need is a ticket.

293
00:24:16,887 --> 00:24:20,323
Come on, big boy.

294
00:24:20,767 --> 00:24:26,160
Ten cents a dance.

295
00:24:36,527 --> 00:24:39,325
She says ''fucking'' in front of
an entire room of people.

296
00:24:39,487 --> 00:24:41,284
-l apologized.
-Did you hear it?

297
00:24:41,487 --> 00:24:42,556
Fucking.

298
00:24:42,807 --> 00:24:45,241
They were on their third Mai Tai
by the time l got out there.

299
00:24:45,407 --> 00:24:46,123
Fucking.

300
00:24:46,287 --> 00:24:48,801
For Christ's sake,
l said it, l didn't do it.

301
00:24:50,047 --> 00:24:52,163
l don't think they were
that offended, do you?

302
00:24:52,367 --> 00:24:55,837
We don't take tips
from dirty old men.

303
00:24:57,287 --> 00:24:58,959
l was going to split it!

304
00:24:59,247 --> 00:25:02,159
We do not take tips.
This goes to cost of the dress.

305
00:25:04,127 --> 00:25:07,164
Then l want my picture
and my name on the poster.

306
00:25:07,327 --> 00:25:09,761
And these shoes
are too fucking tight!

307
00:25:19,487 --> 00:25:20,636
Nice girl.

308
00:26:24,087 --> 00:26:25,281
Where did you find her anyway?

309
00:26:25,447 --> 00:26:26,562
The girl.

310
00:26:27,367 --> 00:26:29,756
She was a kid who hung around.
We gave her a break.

311
00:26:30,807 --> 00:26:32,445
Give her a tip from me, will ya?

312
00:26:33,007 --> 00:26:35,475
Smaller dress means a bigger crowd.

313
00:26:36,567 --> 00:26:39,127
Here you go, guys.
Don't spend it all in one place.

314
00:26:41,767 --> 00:26:42,802
Jack,...

315
00:26:43,327 --> 00:26:44,726
maybe you want to count it.

316
00:26:46,927 --> 00:26:48,918
You know we trust you, Lloyd.

317
00:26:51,687 --> 00:26:53,086
Frankie, while you're here,

318
00:26:53,247 --> 00:26:54,316
how is next week for you guys?

319
00:26:57,407 --> 00:26:58,556
We'll call you.

320
00:27:05,127 --> 00:27:07,436
Did you see his face?
Did you see it?

321
00:27:07,967 --> 00:27:09,161
The world is good.

322
00:27:09,527 --> 00:27:12,246
Don't let anybody
tell you any different.

323
00:27:21,447 --> 00:27:22,766
Good night, Baker.

324
00:27:40,367 --> 00:27:41,720
How ya doing, Henry?

325
00:27:42,127 --> 00:27:43,401
Can't complain.

326
00:27:44,727 --> 00:27:46,126
What do you think of the kid?

327
00:27:52,007 --> 00:27:53,884
When does his mother
pick him up?

328
00:27:54,807 --> 00:27:56,604
He's been playing here for a year.

329
00:27:56,847 --> 00:27:58,565
You ought to come around
more often, Jack.

330
00:28:04,007 --> 00:28:05,599
So how about Jack Baker?

331
00:28:06,487 --> 00:28:08,398
Still stomping at the Sheraton?

332
00:28:10,767 --> 00:28:12,280
Keeps me out of trouble.

333
00:28:14,047 --> 00:28:15,526
Then what are you doing here?

334
00:28:16,887 --> 00:28:18,206
Looking for trouble.

335
00:28:35,367 --> 00:28:37,562
Try to control your excitement, Ed.

336
00:28:42,647 --> 00:28:43,966
Let me see your teeth.

337
00:28:48,127 --> 00:28:49,640
Yeah, they gotta to go.

338
00:28:49,807 --> 00:28:53,516
5 is my guess, maybe more.
Don't know till l get in there.

339
00:28:54,807 --> 00:28:55,956
And bones?

340
00:28:56,127 --> 00:28:58,004
Those days are over, l'm afraid.

341
00:28:58,447 --> 00:29:01,519
Don't worry, we'll knock him out.
He won't feel a thing.

342
00:29:01,687 --> 00:29:02,722
Excuse me.

343
00:29:06,607 --> 00:29:07,835
Should have brushed, pal.

344
00:29:08,007 --> 00:29:10,646
Bernie at the Hilton said

345
00:29:10,807 --> 00:29:13,401
the nights we play,
she's triples her tips.

346
00:29:13,967 --> 00:29:17,755
That's because there's Chivas.
And pearls, not polyester.

347
00:29:17,967 --> 00:29:18,956
l don't understand.

348
00:29:19,127 --> 00:29:22,085
-You're saying we should...
-Ask for a percentage of the bar.

349
00:29:22,567 --> 00:29:24,876
Mel Torme doesn't get
a percentage of the bar.

350
00:29:25,047 --> 00:29:26,560
Maybe he never asked.

351
00:29:29,607 --> 00:29:30,801
Are you hearing this?

352
00:29:31,407 --> 00:29:32,920
How much is she drawing?

353
00:29:33,407 --> 00:29:35,602
Well, two months ago
she was wearing a Timex,

354
00:29:35,767 --> 00:29:39,396
and now a Seiko.
The Hilton didn't put it there.

355
00:29:39,727 --> 00:29:41,843
You're not actually
listening to this, are you?

356
00:29:42,407 --> 00:29:45,558
-Jerry Stein books the Hilton?
-For 8 years!

357
00:29:45,767 --> 00:29:47,962
Forget about the bar.
We'd look like amateurs.

358
00:29:48,767 --> 00:29:50,837
But why not bump them
for an extra 100 up front?

359
00:29:51,447 --> 00:29:52,675
l don't like it.

360
00:29:53,367 --> 00:29:54,959
lt's not how we play the game.

361
00:29:57,647 --> 00:29:59,478
The game is changing.

362
00:30:21,407 --> 00:30:24,240
No, thanks. l never touch
American cigarettes.

363
00:30:25,087 --> 00:30:27,647
3.50 a pack and l go through them!

364
00:30:29,807 --> 00:30:31,081
Paris Opals.

365
00:30:32,007 --> 00:30:33,520
3.50 a pack.

366
00:30:35,367 --> 00:30:36,880
Know how much that is a piece?

367
00:30:37,087 --> 00:30:38,202
17 cents.

368
00:30:38,527 --> 00:30:39,676
1 7 and a half.

369
00:30:39,847 --> 00:30:41,405
l figured it out once.

370
00:30:41,647 --> 00:30:45,083
lf you stick it in your mouth,
it might as well be the best.

371
00:30:49,207 --> 00:30:50,481
Merry Christmas!

372
00:30:53,287 --> 00:30:54,322
What do you think?

373
00:30:57,287 --> 00:31:00,245
lt's me. l thought l'd
give the kids a thrill.

374
00:31:00,527 --> 00:31:02,961
Be bright and early Monday.
We got a long drive.

375
00:31:03,807 --> 00:31:05,001
Merry, merry.

376
00:31:07,127 --> 00:31:08,242
l don't know.

377
00:31:08,487 --> 00:31:10,523
lt's hard figuring you
and Egghead as brothers.

378
00:31:10,687 --> 00:31:13,042
The hospital might have
scrambled the babies.

379
00:31:15,847 --> 00:31:17,166
This is a last soul.

380
00:31:27,967 --> 00:31:29,798
Well, au revoir.

381
00:31:32,207 --> 00:31:33,526
Like a cup of coffee?

382
00:31:35,687 --> 00:31:37,120
Now? On Christmas Eve?

383
00:31:40,287 --> 00:31:42,642
No. lt gives me the shakes.

384
00:31:43,127 --> 00:31:45,482
l better go home, rest the pipes.

385
00:31:47,767 --> 00:31:48,756
Want me to walk you?

386
00:31:53,087 --> 00:31:55,123
No...thanks.

387
00:31:59,087 --> 00:32:01,806
Listen, you're not
going soft on me, are you?

388
00:32:02,807 --> 00:32:05,367
You won't start dreaming about me
and waking up all sweaty,

389
00:32:05,527 --> 00:32:07,916
and look at me like a princess
when l burp?

390
00:32:09,567 --> 00:32:10,556
Forget it.

391
00:32:11,247 --> 00:32:13,397
lt would be too creepy,
with us working together.

392
00:32:14,687 --> 00:32:16,882
Hurry. You're a nickel down
on your cigarette.

393
00:32:26,887 --> 00:32:28,400
Super Chief around the corner.

394
00:32:30,927 --> 00:32:33,282
Bathroom. Super Chief.
Around the corner.

395
00:32:35,407 --> 00:32:37,238
No, l left my dog here
this morning.

396
00:32:37,407 --> 00:32:38,806
Regular hours are 8 to 5.

397
00:32:39,167 --> 00:32:42,557
l know. l was passing and
thought l'd drop by and see him.

398
00:32:43,087 --> 00:32:45,806
You can check on him,
tomorrow between 8 and 5.

399
00:32:46,047 --> 00:32:47,366
l thought l could just...

400
00:32:48,167 --> 00:32:51,000
We are not
communicating here, are we?

401
00:32:55,567 --> 00:32:57,523
You want to know
if he's okay, right?

402
00:32:58,407 --> 00:32:59,396
Yeah.

403
00:33:00,407 --> 00:33:03,365
-Alright. Hold on.
-The name is Baker.

404
00:33:03,527 --> 00:33:05,119
Save it! What's he look like?

405
00:33:05,807 --> 00:33:07,604
Black. Lab.

406
00:33:08,007 --> 00:33:10,726
The dead ones are in the cold room.

407
00:33:32,487 --> 00:33:34,239
No, just a couple of poodles.

408
00:33:42,567 --> 00:33:43,602
l want my dog.

409
00:33:45,927 --> 00:33:49,203
-Listen, get out of here.
-No, you listen you little fuck.

410
00:33:49,727 --> 00:33:53,959
Off your ass, get my dog or l'll
stick the magazine down your throat.

411
00:33:55,207 --> 00:33:57,084
-We communicating now?
-Yeah, all right.

412
00:34:00,967 --> 00:34:02,320
Baker, right?

413
00:34:14,207 --> 00:34:15,799
How about a little light?

414
00:34:16,447 --> 00:34:17,641
Eddie!

415
00:34:19,327 --> 00:34:21,682
Forget it. He's still
circling the airport.

416
00:34:23,367 --> 00:34:25,676
l didn't know you were
coming home tonight.

417
00:34:26,047 --> 00:34:29,756
We sort of
skipped the paperwork.

418
00:34:32,607 --> 00:34:34,404
Besides, it's Christmas, right?

419
00:34:38,487 --> 00:34:39,886
Where's your ma tonight?

420
00:34:41,407 --> 00:34:43,045
Out with Bigfoot again?

421
00:34:47,327 --> 00:34:48,760
Did you play her the solo?

422
00:34:49,367 --> 00:34:51,437
Maybe tomorrow, she said.

423
00:34:56,567 --> 00:34:58,364
Just you and me again, huh?

424
00:35:03,007 --> 00:35:04,201
From Hurley's?

425
00:35:07,167 --> 00:35:09,078
Eighty proof.
Think you can handle it?

426
00:35:16,167 --> 00:35:17,566
Go easy now.

427
00:35:24,327 --> 00:35:25,521
Jack?

428
00:35:26,487 --> 00:35:27,681
Yeah?

429
00:35:30,167 --> 00:35:33,125
Can l stay here tonight?
Even if she comes home alone?

430
00:35:35,967 --> 00:35:36,956
Okay.

431
00:35:51,407 --> 00:35:52,965
He's seeing you off, right?

432
00:35:55,807 --> 00:35:57,479
Jack, this is not possible.

433
00:35:58,007 --> 00:36:00,965
We're playing a resort hotel.
You can't take a dog.

434
00:36:01,127 --> 00:36:02,446
lt's not possible.

435
00:36:04,087 --> 00:36:05,315
lt's possible.

436
00:36:10,327 --> 00:36:12,124
Get this.
Each room is an event.

437
00:36:12,287 --> 00:36:14,517
An excursion into
unprecedented luxury.

438
00:36:14,687 --> 00:36:18,600
Outside, the adventure continues
with your own private terrace.

439
00:36:19,247 --> 00:36:20,965
You don't think it
really looks like that, do you?

440
00:36:22,607 --> 00:36:23,835
There are pictures right here.

441
00:36:24,047 --> 00:36:25,605
Hear that, Jack? Pictures.

442
00:36:26,207 --> 00:36:29,882
Welcome to the road, Dorothy.
You're about to lose your virginity.

443
00:36:56,967 --> 00:36:58,480
Why, thank you.

444
00:37:02,687 --> 00:37:04,518
l'll see you boys inside.

445
00:37:31,847 --> 00:37:33,917
l took the right side of the closet.

446
00:37:34,807 --> 00:37:37,241
Since my bed's on the right,
l think it makes sense.

447
00:37:37,447 --> 00:37:39,915
-Right.
-We'll do the drawers the same.

448
00:37:42,287 --> 00:37:43,925
Unless you want the right.

449
00:37:45,447 --> 00:37:46,766
No, you take the right.

450
00:37:49,647 --> 00:37:52,525
Looks like Carmen Miranda
had an accident in my room.

451
00:37:53,247 --> 00:37:55,238
They must get a deal on these.

452
00:37:57,127 --> 00:37:58,606
What do you make of this?

453
00:37:59,047 --> 00:38:00,162
Kiwi.

454
00:38:01,287 --> 00:38:03,517
lt's got more hair than you, Frank.

455
00:38:04,607 --> 00:38:06,518
No peeking at tub time.

456
00:38:21,007 --> 00:38:22,645
What the hell is this?

457
00:38:26,807 --> 00:38:28,718
Do you hear this?

458
00:38:30,647 --> 00:38:31,921
l do now.

459
00:38:32,087 --> 00:38:35,716
Great! Before we play a note,
we're gonna get thrown out.

460
00:38:36,487 --> 00:38:38,205
So she's playing a little music.

461
00:38:38,367 --> 00:38:40,756
She's got the
Harry James Orchestra in there!

462
00:38:40,927 --> 00:38:41,837
Ellington.

463
00:38:43,127 --> 00:38:44,116
Frank!

464
00:38:44,287 --> 00:38:45,322
What?

465
00:38:48,567 --> 00:38:50,205
You're looking a little tense.

466
00:38:50,367 --> 00:38:54,565
Of course! lt's 2 AM and she's
going to wake up everyone!

467
00:38:59,007 --> 00:38:59,996
See?

468
00:39:12,167 --> 00:39:13,441
Massage?

469
00:39:14,247 --> 00:39:15,646
Down here, gorgeous.

470
00:39:20,487 --> 00:39:22,239
l figured you for jockeys.

471
00:39:23,967 --> 00:39:25,161
New socks?

472
00:41:08,767 --> 00:41:10,917
Mark my words.

473
00:41:11,087 --> 00:41:14,318
From this night forward,
our lives will never be the same.

474
00:41:14,487 --> 00:41:18,526
Frank, you get a lot of pop
out of two glasses of champagne.

475
00:41:19,967 --> 00:41:22,242
Long way from
''Hula Girl Hideaway'', eh?

476
00:41:22,407 --> 00:41:24,443
Remember?
Banana trees in the lobby.

477
00:41:24,607 --> 00:41:26,279
Takahama's Tahitian.

478
00:41:26,447 --> 00:41:27,926
Did we play there?

479
00:41:28,087 --> 00:41:30,760
-l thought we stopped for teriyaki.
-Three nights.

480
00:41:31,047 --> 00:41:34,278
lt's amazing. He can remember
ever place we ever played.

481
00:41:34,447 --> 00:41:37,041
The day, the month, the year,
how many shows, you name it.

482
00:41:37,407 --> 00:41:38,806
When was Takahama's?

483
00:41:39,847 --> 00:41:41,246
August '7 4.

484
00:41:41,767 --> 00:41:44,235
See? He's brilliant.
Really!

485
00:41:46,447 --> 00:41:47,482
Brilliant!

486
00:41:48,927 --> 00:41:49,996
Hey, Jack.

487
00:41:53,247 --> 00:41:54,521
You are brilliant.

488
00:41:57,487 --> 00:41:58,556
Thanks.

489
00:41:59,047 --> 00:42:01,356
lt's the same with music.
Should've seen him as a kid.

490
00:42:01,527 --> 00:42:03,836
Nobody could
ride the keys like Jack.

491
00:42:04,647 --> 00:42:07,480
Mrs. Simpson played
something once, and he had it.

492
00:42:07,887 --> 00:42:09,002
Really?

493
00:42:11,367 --> 00:42:14,086
l never won a single
blue ribbon until the day Jack

494
00:42:14,247 --> 00:42:17,125
showed up drunk
at spring recital and played

495
00:42:17,607 --> 00:42:20,485
''One O'clock Jump''
instead of ''Clare de Lune''.

496
00:42:21,407 --> 00:42:22,635
The mood just hit me.

497
00:42:37,807 --> 00:42:39,035
''Moonglow''.

498
00:42:46,407 --> 00:42:48,363
-''Moonglow''?
-High school. l couldn't dance.

499
00:42:48,527 --> 00:42:51,599
Jack did the box step
with me for a week.

500
00:42:51,927 --> 00:42:54,566
lt wasn't a week.

501
00:42:54,727 --> 00:42:57,161
-You two are that close?
-He paid me.

502
00:42:57,367 --> 00:43:01,360
lt was my first social with Donna.
We fell in love on the dance floor.

503
00:43:01,607 --> 00:43:04,599
l have a beautiful wife,
two beautiful children,

504
00:43:04,767 --> 00:43:06,644
all because of my brother.

505
00:43:06,807 --> 00:43:09,037
You overestimate the box step.

506
00:43:09,447 --> 00:43:12,245
lt was just like this,
on our honeymoon.

507
00:43:12,727 --> 00:43:15,036
The moon, the stars.

508
00:43:15,927 --> 00:43:16,996
Remember, Jack?

509
00:43:17,447 --> 00:43:18,721
l wasn't there.

510
00:43:20,087 --> 00:43:21,202
Right.

511
00:43:21,527 --> 00:43:23,916
My first solo gig.

512
00:43:28,567 --> 00:43:29,920
God, she was gorgeous.

513
00:43:32,407 --> 00:43:34,238
l couldn't believe she was mine.

514
00:43:37,567 --> 00:43:39,319
How come l got so lucky, Jack?

515
00:43:40,687 --> 00:43:42,040
You're a lucky guy.

516
00:43:42,847 --> 00:43:43,836
You know?

517
00:43:44,487 --> 00:43:47,047
l never kissed my wife
on New Year's Eve.

518
00:43:48,527 --> 00:43:52,156
l'm always on stage somewhere.

519
00:43:57,447 --> 00:43:59,165
l think l'm drunk.
You two dance.

520
00:43:59,687 --> 00:44:00,676
l'm gonna...

521
00:44:00,887 --> 00:44:02,320
go sit with the wallflowers.

522
00:44:02,487 --> 00:44:03,966
l'm not used to leading.

523
00:44:06,847 --> 00:44:09,077
Come on, give the girl a glide.

524
00:44:09,247 --> 00:44:12,159
No. l think your little brother
prefers to dance alone.

525
00:44:16,007 --> 00:44:17,201
No, thanks.

526
00:44:20,447 --> 00:44:22,517
l never touch French cigarettes.

527
00:44:42,367 --> 00:44:43,766
Your brother's a good dancer.

528
00:44:44,487 --> 00:44:45,886
Big heartbreaker.

529
00:44:46,047 --> 00:44:48,959
A couple of turns, that was it.

530
00:44:49,447 --> 00:44:50,516
Really?

531
00:44:51,127 --> 00:44:52,606
Got them right in the knees.

532
00:44:52,967 --> 00:44:55,356
Practically had to
carry the girls off the floor.

533
00:44:56,367 --> 00:44:57,402
Really?

534
00:44:59,367 --> 00:45:01,198
Have another drink, Frank.

535
00:45:01,767 --> 00:45:02,916
No, l'm sleepy.

536
00:45:03,127 --> 00:45:04,765
Go to sleep then.

537
00:45:08,927 --> 00:45:09,916
Alright.

538
00:45:26,487 --> 00:45:28,523
l think l just lost my chaperone.

539
00:45:29,687 --> 00:45:30,961
You're safe.

540
00:45:36,167 --> 00:45:38,681
So where do you keep
your blue ribbons, Mr. Baker?

541
00:45:40,927 --> 00:45:42,246
Frank keeps them.

542
00:45:52,847 --> 00:45:54,326
Nice night, huh?

543
00:46:01,647 --> 00:46:03,160
lt's quiet, it's like...

544
00:46:04,287 --> 00:46:06,357
the whole world is asleep.

545
00:46:11,407 --> 00:46:12,476
Careful.

546
00:46:14,407 --> 00:46:16,284
l had too much to drink.

547
00:46:17,327 --> 00:46:19,443
Champagne goes right to my head.

548
00:46:22,567 --> 00:46:24,922
-Maybe we should call it a night.
-Yeah.

549
00:46:51,767 --> 00:46:52,961
Miss Diamond!

550
00:46:57,887 --> 00:46:59,002
These just arrived for you.

551
00:46:59,927 --> 00:47:01,679
Looks like you have an admirer.

552
00:47:03,367 --> 00:47:04,402
There's no card.

553
00:47:04,927 --> 00:47:07,236
The gentleman said
he would be in contact with you.

554
00:47:07,407 --> 00:47:11,525
He's with the cat food convention.
l can have put them in water.

555
00:47:11,687 --> 00:47:12,802
No, that's alright.

556
00:48:25,007 --> 00:48:26,122
lt's nice.

557
00:48:28,327 --> 00:48:29,476
lt's nice.

558
00:48:40,767 --> 00:48:44,760
lt's been 5 years since
l've seen you without a cigarette.

559
00:48:45,007 --> 00:48:47,601
The whole room upstairs
smells like an ashtray.

560
00:48:47,847 --> 00:48:49,838
You know that? The sheets,

561
00:48:50,767 --> 00:48:54,362
the carpets, the drapes.
The towels, my tux, my shirt.

562
00:48:55,487 --> 00:48:57,045
Want to smell my shirt?

563
00:48:57,247 --> 00:48:58,441
Maybe later.

564
00:48:58,887 --> 00:49:02,243
l'm not kidding. Do you know
what an insidious habit that is?

565
00:49:02,407 --> 00:49:06,400
How many do you smoke a day?
Must be hundreds!

566
00:49:09,327 --> 00:49:12,558
This is just a wild stab,
but is something bothering you?

567
00:49:15,007 --> 00:49:16,201
Leave her alone.

568
00:49:16,927 --> 00:49:18,121
l mean it.

569
00:49:18,727 --> 00:49:22,197
This isn't a hatcheck girl you can
leave behind at the Sheraton.

570
00:49:22,367 --> 00:49:24,198
You've got two shows
a night with her.

571
00:49:27,247 --> 00:49:28,805
You don't know what you're saying.

572
00:49:29,127 --> 00:49:31,880
l know trouble,
and it's name starts with 'S'.

573
00:49:32,207 --> 00:49:34,084
Do me a favor, Frank.
Relax.

574
00:49:34,327 --> 00:49:38,206
Do me a favor, little brother.
Stick to cocktail waitresses.

575
00:49:45,407 --> 00:49:46,726
Meeting here each night,

576
00:49:46,887 --> 00:49:49,196
sharing these few moments,

577
00:49:49,767 --> 00:49:52,281
l feel as if we're becoming
one big happy family.

578
00:49:52,967 --> 00:49:55,879
The fine wine, the music...

579
00:49:56,447 --> 00:49:58,756
What's all this mean?
l don't know. Who's to say?

580
00:49:59,087 --> 00:50:00,486
All l can tell you is...

581
00:50:00,647 --> 00:50:03,241
it makes it very special
for us here...

582
00:50:03,527 --> 00:50:06,166
to have you out there.
Right, Susie?

583
00:50:06,407 --> 00:50:07,396
Right, Frank.

584
00:50:07,767 --> 00:50:08,961
Right, Jack?

585
00:50:09,287 --> 00:50:10,436
Right.

586
00:50:10,847 --> 00:50:13,486
But if l can add one more thing.

587
00:50:14,407 --> 00:50:15,760
l love you, Frank.

588
00:50:17,087 --> 00:50:17,997
What?

589
00:50:20,167 --> 00:50:21,316
l love you.

590
00:50:22,847 --> 00:50:24,326
l just wanted to say it.

591
00:50:31,767 --> 00:50:33,997
You came in late on
''Little Green Apples''.

592
00:50:34,727 --> 00:50:36,399
-Excuse me?
-You heard me.

593
00:50:37,767 --> 00:50:39,997
No, Frank.
You came in early.

594
00:50:41,487 --> 00:50:45,162
-You have flor the past decade.
-l never missed a beat.

595
00:50:46,327 --> 00:50:48,397
l never miss the beat!

596
00:50:48,567 --> 00:50:50,285
That's because you make it up.

597
00:50:51,447 --> 00:50:52,562
Take it back.

598
00:50:53,167 --> 00:50:54,680
Take it back?
What's this, the 3rd grade?

599
00:50:54,847 --> 00:50:56,041
Take it back!

600
00:50:56,967 --> 00:50:58,525
Take a kiwi, Frank.

601
00:51:02,887 --> 00:51:05,321
Go to bed, Frank,
or this will get ugly.

602
00:51:06,487 --> 00:51:08,364
-Yeah?
-Yeah, come on.

603
00:51:08,967 --> 00:51:11,083
lt's the fucking Newlywed Game.

604
00:51:11,247 --> 00:51:13,602
-You hit me.
-Í told you l was go¡ng to.

605
00:51:25,287 --> 00:51:27,084
Hello? Yeah.

606
00:51:29,767 --> 00:51:32,520
No, this is 512-B.

607
00:51:32,687 --> 00:51:34,882
Mr. Baker is in 512-A.

608
00:51:40,087 --> 00:51:41,236
Urgent.

609
00:51:41,767 --> 00:51:43,883
No, never mind. l'll get him.

610
00:51:46,447 --> 00:51:47,800
We made a deal.

611
00:51:48,447 --> 00:51:50,483
Training wheels flor a month,
then we would see.

612
00:51:50,647 --> 00:51:51,966
He ran into somebody's car?

613
00:51:52,127 --> 00:51:55,483
Mrs. Ramadino's station wagon.

614
00:51:55,647 --> 00:51:57,126
lt was parked on the street.

615
00:51:57,367 --> 00:52:00,245
Got a pencil?
Pencil anybody?

616
00:52:01,687 --> 00:52:02,403
Here.

617
00:52:02,567 --> 00:52:05,240
l want you to take down
the New Year show.

618
00:52:05,967 --> 00:52:08,083
10 o'clock you start with
''Thanks for the Memories''.

619
00:52:08,247 --> 00:52:10,556
-Then you segue into...
-''Happy Days Are Here Again''.

620
00:52:10,727 --> 00:52:14,197
-l know the show.
-Then the song from Camelot.

621
00:52:18,447 --> 00:52:20,005
Don't hesitate to call.

622
00:52:20,487 --> 00:52:21,522
Come on.

623
00:52:27,647 --> 00:52:29,285
Any word from Egghead?

624
00:52:32,087 --> 00:52:34,806
l saved you the crossword.

625
00:52:38,167 --> 00:52:39,156
Thanks.

626
00:52:55,647 --> 00:52:56,875
Well, happy reading.

627
00:55:31,807 --> 00:55:32,796
Hear anything yet?

628
00:55:33,847 --> 00:55:34,882
Not a peep.

629
00:55:38,527 --> 00:55:40,324
l'm going to take a bath.

630
00:56:01,327 --> 00:56:03,716
Yeah?

631
00:56:04,607 --> 00:56:05,722
lt's Frank.

632
00:56:06,727 --> 00:56:07,955
So how's little Frank?

633
00:56:09,207 --> 00:56:11,163
Good. That's a relief.

634
00:56:13,087 --> 00:56:15,396
No, l understand.
Call me when you have time.

635
00:56:15,567 --> 00:56:16,761
What are you doing?

636
00:56:18,407 --> 00:56:19,681
We're taking a bath.

637
00:56:20,647 --> 00:56:21,966
l mean...

638
00:56:22,967 --> 00:56:25,606
Susie's taking a bath.
l'm doing the crossword puzzle.

639
00:56:26,367 --> 00:56:27,356
Okay.

640
00:56:27,727 --> 00:56:28,716
Bye.

641
00:56:30,887 --> 00:56:32,002
Kid's in the pink.

642
00:56:32,847 --> 00:56:33,882
Good.

643
00:59:25,687 --> 00:59:28,645
Boys and girls,
find a friend. This is it!

644
00:59:28,807 --> 00:59:32,800
Ten, nine, eight, seven...

645
00:59:33,367 --> 00:59:37,121
six, five, four, three...

646
00:59:37,647 --> 00:59:39,399
two, one...

647
01:00:34,847 --> 01:00:36,041
So...

648
01:00:37,287 --> 01:00:39,118
make any resolutions?

649
01:00:41,087 --> 01:00:42,361
No. You?

650
01:00:44,527 --> 01:00:47,246
No. l figure that stuff
is a bunch of crap anyway.

651
01:00:49,407 --> 01:00:51,716
-You do what you do, right?
-That's right.

652
01:00:54,287 --> 01:00:57,597
Old Egghead would've blown
a gasket seeing us here tonight!

653
01:01:03,487 --> 01:01:05,079
You're good, aren't you?

654
01:01:12,247 --> 01:01:13,726
l can carry a tune.

655
01:01:15,487 --> 01:01:16,840
You're better than that.

656
01:01:25,527 --> 01:01:27,199
l saw you guys once.

657
01:01:29,847 --> 01:01:31,326
You and Frank.

658
01:01:33,247 --> 01:01:34,521
At the Roosevelt.

659
01:01:36,287 --> 01:01:37,925
Must've been a cheap date.

660
01:01:41,447 --> 01:01:42,846
Soap convention.

661
01:01:43,287 --> 01:01:44,402
Soap?

662
01:01:45,647 --> 01:01:48,241
Yeah, they got
a convention for everything.

663
01:01:48,527 --> 01:01:50,802
The guy was some
big roller in suds.

664
01:01:54,407 --> 01:01:58,400
At least he was clean.
Some guys you wouldn't believe.

665
01:02:02,567 --> 01:02:04,637
The older ones,
they weren't so bad.

666
01:02:05,767 --> 01:02:07,917
Nice. Polite.

667
01:02:08,647 --> 01:02:10,285
Pulled you chair out for you.

668
01:02:13,007 --> 01:02:14,406
But the younger ones...

669
01:02:21,967 --> 01:02:24,117
lt wasn't so bad.
l'd get a nice piece of steak,

670
01:02:24,287 --> 01:02:26,642
flowers, sometimes even a gift.

671
01:02:26,807 --> 01:02:28,559
Usually whatever the guy was into.

672
01:02:29,047 --> 01:02:31,197
l got a set of
socket wrenches once.

673
01:02:33,447 --> 01:02:37,076
Guy looked at me like
he'd given me 4 dozen roses.

674
01:02:42,607 --> 01:02:45,075
But l stayed at
the Hartford one time.

675
01:02:48,247 --> 01:02:52,081
You should see the rooms.
All satin and velvet.

676
01:02:52,887 --> 01:02:54,081
And the bed...

677
01:02:54,247 --> 01:02:57,364
royal blue, trimmed in lace
clean as snow.

678
01:03:00,527 --> 01:03:03,564
Hard to believe a room like that
don't change your life.

679
01:03:05,447 --> 01:03:06,721
But it don't.

680
01:03:07,207 --> 01:03:09,038
The bed may be magic,

681
01:03:09,727 --> 01:03:11,160
but the mirror isn't.

682
01:03:12,567 --> 01:03:14,637
Still wake up the same old Susie.

683
01:03:19,207 --> 01:03:20,481
l didn't always.

684
01:03:20,967 --> 01:03:22,241
You know, l mean...

685
01:03:23,447 --> 01:03:25,085
if l liked the guy.

686
01:03:29,847 --> 01:03:32,281
l never liked
the Hartford much myself.

687
01:03:44,727 --> 01:03:46,604
My neck, it's so tight.

688
01:03:47,407 --> 01:03:49,557
Usually singing relaxes me.

689
01:03:50,127 --> 01:03:51,879
But tonight...

690
01:03:58,807 --> 01:03:59,842
Thanks.

691
01:06:22,607 --> 01:06:25,121
You'd make a hell of a fireman,
you know that?

692
01:06:31,407 --> 01:06:34,001
Do you practice that at home
with a stopwatch?

693
01:06:37,047 --> 01:06:38,275
l didn't want to wake you.

694
01:06:40,247 --> 01:06:41,566
l'm an early riser.

695
01:06:48,807 --> 01:06:52,516
l didn't expect you to
buy be a corsage this morning.

696
01:06:55,647 --> 01:06:57,205
Your high school ring is safe.

697
01:07:19,647 --> 01:07:20,716
Shit!

698
01:07:25,087 --> 01:07:26,156
Shit!

699
01:08:02,247 --> 01:08:04,317
That takes care of
the week of the 5th.

700
01:08:04,807 --> 01:08:08,322
After that, we got the Avedon
or the Plaza, 4 day turn.

701
01:08:08,487 --> 01:08:09,806
What do you think, Jack?

702
01:08:11,727 --> 01:08:13,001
You with me, Jack?

703
01:08:13,927 --> 01:08:15,519
The Avedon's a dump.

704
01:08:16,167 --> 01:08:18,806
There's no cover, no minimum.
They water their drinks.

705
01:08:18,967 --> 01:08:20,685
Strictly the Fuller Brush crowd.

706
01:08:21,567 --> 01:08:24,923
lt's not that bad. Besides,
Blacky Carson books the Avedon.

707
01:08:26,527 --> 01:08:28,119
He's always been good to us.

708
01:08:30,487 --> 01:08:33,604
-He hasn't been that good.
-Okay, we'll take the Plaza.

709
01:08:33,767 --> 01:08:36,725
-Then the Capri flor 5 days.
-Not the Luau Lounge again.

710
01:08:36,927 --> 01:08:39,282
What the matter?
They don't salt their peanuts?

711
01:08:39,487 --> 01:08:42,047
Singing ''Feelings'',
knee-deep in paper orchids

712
01:08:42,207 --> 01:08:44,038
and plastic Tiki lamps

713
01:08:44,207 --> 01:08:47,358
is not my idea
of a fun evening.

714
01:08:49,007 --> 01:08:51,646
Fun? Who promised you fun?
We get paid, remember?

715
01:08:51,807 --> 01:08:53,843
l'm saying,
maybe we should vote on it.

716
01:08:58,007 --> 01:08:59,838
Maybe we should ask Jack
what he thinks.

717
01:09:00,007 --> 01:09:02,396
l don't have to.
l know what he thinks.

718
01:09:02,607 --> 01:09:05,041
lt's 5 days, the money's green.
We're there.

719
01:09:07,767 --> 01:09:10,679
Speaking about ''Feelings'',
you might brush up on the lyrics.

720
01:09:10,847 --> 01:09:13,361
The other night,
you sang the first verse twice.

721
01:09:13,527 --> 01:09:14,642
Really?

722
01:09:15,567 --> 01:09:18,206
That explains the gasps
l heard from the audience.

723
01:09:19,007 --> 01:09:23,523
We trashed the Avedon, the Luau.
What's your beef with ''Feelings''?

724
01:09:23,847 --> 01:09:24,962
Nothing.

725
01:09:28,647 --> 01:09:30,046
Except, who cares?

726
01:09:30,367 --> 01:09:32,437
Does anybody really
need to hear ''Feelings''

727
01:09:32,607 --> 01:09:34,006
again in a lifetime?

728
01:09:35,247 --> 01:09:36,760
lt's like parsley.

729
01:09:36,927 --> 01:09:38,963
Take it away,
nobody knows the difference.

730
01:09:39,127 --> 01:09:40,845
''Feelings'' isn't parsley.

731
01:09:41,047 --> 01:09:44,039
To you, ''Feelings''
may be filet mignon.

732
01:09:44,407 --> 01:09:47,160
To me, it's parsley.
Less than parsley.

733
01:09:47,407 --> 01:09:50,080
Look, ''Feelings'',
despite what you think ofl it,

734
01:09:50,247 --> 01:09:52,636
is always a bright moment
and a crowd-pleaser.

735
01:09:52,807 --> 01:09:55,924
Consequently, we have
an obligation to perform it.

736
01:09:56,407 --> 01:09:58,523
The audience would be disappointed.

737
01:09:58,847 --> 01:10:01,680
They weren't crying
on New Year's Eve.

738
01:10:07,407 --> 01:10:08,806
You passed over ''Feelings''?

739
01:10:09,127 --> 01:10:10,196
Yeah.

740
01:10:11,487 --> 01:10:12,476
And...

741
01:10:12,647 --> 01:10:14,922
''Bali Hai'' went out
with the bath water, too.

742
01:10:19,287 --> 01:10:20,356
l see.

743
01:10:21,407 --> 01:10:24,683
The cat goes away and the mice
take over the orchestra.

744
01:10:24,847 --> 01:10:25,438
Hey,

745
01:10:25,847 --> 01:10:27,200
l ain't no mouse.

746
01:10:27,407 --> 01:10:28,965
That's right. You're parsley.

747
01:10:35,127 --> 01:10:38,244
This food's been sitting here
too long. lt's making me sick.

748
01:10:48,367 --> 01:10:50,244
Why don't you loosen the leash?

749
01:10:51,287 --> 01:10:55,200
Let's not let a whiff of perfume
blow off 15 years. Be reasonable.

750
01:10:56,127 --> 01:10:59,802
l play 300 nights a year with you.
ls that reasonable enough?

751
01:12:32,887 --> 01:12:34,559
Can l have a double vodka, please?

752
01:13:29,927 --> 01:13:32,316
l was in the neighborhood.

753
01:13:44,367 --> 01:13:47,165
Listen, don't get nervous.
l just came by to...

754
01:13:50,327 --> 01:13:51,476
talk.

755
01:14:20,207 --> 01:14:22,118
l guess you found him, huh?

756
01:14:25,447 --> 01:14:26,436
Yeah.

757
01:14:29,527 --> 01:14:31,119
l came to walk Eddie.

758
01:14:31,727 --> 01:14:32,716
Come.

759
01:15:02,967 --> 01:15:04,446
Terry's Tap Room.

760
01:15:07,487 --> 01:15:09,318
First gig we ever played.

761
01:15:10,967 --> 01:15:13,561
The owner gave us that bottle,
but wouldn't open it.

762
01:15:13,727 --> 01:15:14,716
How come?

763
01:15:15,207 --> 01:15:17,038
Told us to save it.

764
01:15:20,247 --> 01:15:22,522
He said someday it would
soften the edges of the bad times.

765
01:15:22,687 --> 01:15:24,837
And make the good ones
seem even better.

766
01:15:27,727 --> 01:15:31,356
We should've drunk it before
we played Terry's Tap Room.

767
01:15:31,727 --> 01:15:33,046
Want some coffee?

768
01:15:40,607 --> 01:15:41,835
You want to leave?

769
01:15:43,607 --> 01:15:44,642
Listen.

770
01:15:47,047 --> 01:15:49,242
The reason l came last night is...

771
01:15:50,767 --> 01:15:53,406
l'm thinking about leaving.

772
01:15:54,367 --> 01:15:55,402
The act.

773
01:15:59,847 --> 01:16:02,645
l met this guy
at New Year's at the Hotel.

774
01:16:03,367 --> 01:16:05,597
And he liked my voice.

775
01:16:08,047 --> 01:16:11,164
He thinks l can sell
cat food just by singing about it.

776
01:16:13,287 --> 01:16:14,481
lt's crazy, huh?

777
01:16:18,047 --> 01:16:19,162
Take it.

778
01:16:19,567 --> 01:16:22,957
l haven't decided yet.
l'm just thinking about it.

779
01:16:23,767 --> 01:16:24,995
No, take it.

780
01:16:33,207 --> 01:16:35,402
How long have you been
taking care of the kid upstairs?

781
01:16:36,447 --> 01:16:37,880
l don't take care ofl her.

782
01:16:38,887 --> 01:16:40,320
Didn't look that way to me.

783
01:16:40,767 --> 01:16:41,961
What's the difference?

784
01:16:44,967 --> 01:16:47,925
Anyway, l know Frank
has us booked through March.

785
01:16:49,287 --> 01:16:50,766
Don't worry about Frank.

786
01:16:52,407 --> 01:16:53,601
What about you?

787
01:16:54,367 --> 01:16:55,959
What's that to do with anything?

788
01:16:58,807 --> 01:17:02,482
Nothing. l don't want to
leave you guys with an empty mike.

789
01:17:05,007 --> 01:17:06,679
There's always another girl.

790
01:17:17,367 --> 01:17:18,356
Right.

791
01:17:24,367 --> 01:17:25,800
Thanks for the advice.

792
01:17:27,007 --> 01:17:28,156
l'll think it over.

793
01:18:41,007 --> 01:18:42,804
l told Frank l'm quitting.

794
01:18:44,807 --> 01:18:46,001
Congratulations.

795
01:18:47,727 --> 01:18:48,842
As of now.

796
01:18:54,607 --> 01:18:57,075
lf you need a recommendation,
you let me know.

797
01:18:57,967 --> 01:19:00,083
Jesus you're cold! You know that?

798
01:19:01,007 --> 01:19:03,202
You are like
a fucking razor blade.

799
01:19:03,687 --> 01:19:06,121
Careful, you'll have me thinking
you're going soft on me.

800
01:19:08,047 --> 01:19:11,119
You don't give a fuck, do you?
About anything.

801
01:19:12,887 --> 01:19:15,082
What do you want from me?
To tell you to stay?

802
01:19:15,327 --> 01:19:19,559
Beg on my knees for you to
save the Baker Boys from doom?

803
01:19:19,807 --> 01:19:21,035
Forget it, sweetheart.

804
01:19:21,567 --> 01:19:24,240
We survived for 15 years
before you strutted on the scene.

805
01:19:24,847 --> 01:19:27,566
Two seconds and you're
bawling like a baby.

806
01:19:28,327 --> 01:19:30,921
You should be wearing
a diaper, not a dress.

807
01:19:32,647 --> 01:19:34,399
You and he are brothers, aren't you?

808
01:19:35,247 --> 01:19:36,726
Let me tell you something.

809
01:19:36,967 --> 01:19:41,085
They've dropped like flies.
We're still here!

810
01:19:41,567 --> 01:19:43,797
We've never held
a day job in our lives.

811
01:19:44,327 --> 01:19:47,160
He's an easy target,
but add it up, he's done fine.

812
01:19:47,567 --> 01:19:49,478
Yeah, Frank has done great.

813
01:19:49,647 --> 01:19:52,923
He has the wife, kids,
little house in the suburbs.

814
01:19:53,807 --> 01:19:56,719
While his brother lives
a shitty apartment with a sick dog,

815
01:19:56,887 --> 01:19:59,481
Little Orphan Annie and a chip
on his shoulder size of a Cadillac.

816
01:19:59,767 --> 01:20:03,043
Listen, Princess.
We fucked twice, that's it.

817
01:20:03,607 --> 01:20:06,599
Once the sweat dries,
you still know shit about me.

818
01:20:07,047 --> 01:20:10,960
l know one thing.
While Frank put his kids to bed,

819
01:20:11,127 --> 01:20:14,244
little brother Jack
was dusting off his dreams.

820
01:20:15,927 --> 01:20:16,996
l was there.

821
01:20:17,927 --> 01:20:19,406
l saw it in your face.

822
01:20:20,567 --> 01:20:23,240
You're full of shit.
You're a fake.

823
01:20:24,167 --> 01:20:26,476
Every time you walk in those places,

824
01:20:26,927 --> 01:20:28,599
you're selling yourself cheap.

825
01:20:29,967 --> 01:20:32,800
l know all about that.
l find myself at the end of the night

826
01:20:32,967 --> 01:20:35,686
with some creep,
and l tell myself it doesn't matter.

827
01:20:36,167 --> 01:20:39,637
You kid yourself you've got
this empty place inside to put it.

828
01:20:39,927 --> 01:20:42,441
But do it long enough
and all you are is empty.

829
01:20:43,887 --> 01:20:46,037
l didn't know whores
were so philosophical.

830
01:20:47,647 --> 01:20:49,558
At least
my brother's not my pimp.

831
01:20:52,247 --> 01:20:54,636
l had you pegged for a loser
the first time l saw you.

832
01:20:54,807 --> 01:20:56,320
But you're worse.

833
01:20:57,327 --> 01:20:58,521
You're a coward.

834
01:21:09,007 --> 01:21:12,044
My name is Frank Baker

835
01:21:12,287 --> 01:21:14,960
and you know my brother Jack.

836
01:21:15,727 --> 01:21:19,356
My brother and l have been
playing together for...

837
01:21:21,207 --> 01:21:22,435
l don't know.

838
01:21:22,887 --> 01:21:23,956
Jack?

839
01:21:25,647 --> 01:21:26,762
31 years.

840
01:21:27,767 --> 01:21:29,644
But of course, back then...

841
01:21:29,847 --> 01:21:31,519
it was a little different.

842
01:21:34,727 --> 01:21:37,036
We were just kids.

843
01:21:37,687 --> 01:21:40,918
The only one who'd listen to us
was the family cat, Cecil.

844
01:21:44,087 --> 01:21:46,885
We must've shaved
two lives off that cat, huh?

845
01:22:10,287 --> 01:22:11,356
Sorry.

846
01:22:17,767 --> 01:22:19,598
We're not getting paid then.

847
01:22:19,767 --> 01:22:22,440
l told you, it's a telethon.
No one gets a cent.

848
01:22:26,087 --> 01:22:27,122
What's it for?

849
01:22:27,647 --> 01:22:29,205
l don't know, some disease.

850
01:22:29,527 --> 01:22:31,165
What channel is it on?

851
01:22:32,687 --> 01:22:33,802
71 .

852
01:22:38,087 --> 01:22:40,521
71 ? What is 71?

853
01:22:40,967 --> 01:22:44,676
A channel, just a little further
down the dial. lt's publicity.

854
01:22:44,847 --> 01:22:46,678
Publicity's publicity, right?

855
01:22:48,887 --> 01:22:49,876
Right.

856
01:23:03,047 --> 01:23:04,275
l'll see when we're on.

857
01:23:16,007 --> 01:23:17,599
What's wrong with the kid.

858
01:23:17,887 --> 01:23:20,959
Tore his knee playing St Joseph's
just before the accident.

859
01:23:23,167 --> 01:23:24,156
Accident?

860
01:23:24,327 --> 01:23:25,646
The fire.

861
01:23:25,847 --> 01:23:30,045
Rate we're going, we'll be lucky
to buy jockstraps, let alone a gym.

862
01:23:33,487 --> 01:23:34,715
Earl the pearl!

863
01:23:35,367 --> 01:23:37,483
We're on after Mr. Basketball.

864
01:23:41,807 --> 01:23:43,923
-Are you fucking kidding me?
-What?

865
01:23:44,887 --> 01:23:46,605
We're playing for
a God damn gymnasium.

866
01:23:46,767 --> 01:23:48,485
Let's hear it for Jimmy Marshall.

867
01:23:49,887 --> 01:23:52,082
Most of you know
Jimmy twisted that knee

868
01:23:52,247 --> 01:23:54,283
trying to win one for
good old Lahuga High this year.

869
01:23:54,447 --> 01:23:57,439
Luckily, the doctors tell us that
Jimmy will play next season.

870
01:23:57,607 --> 01:23:59,916
That's where you come in.
Pick up the phone. Make a donation.

871
01:24:00,167 --> 01:24:03,921
Keep our kids off the street
and into the gym.

872
01:24:06,007 --> 01:24:06,996
All right!

873
01:24:07,167 --> 01:24:09,078
Get your fucking hands off me.

874
01:24:09,407 --> 01:24:11,523
We are pleased to have

875
01:24:11,687 --> 01:24:14,918
two of the most respected men
in the musical entertainment field.

876
01:24:15,367 --> 01:24:17,835
The Fabulous Bunker Boys!

877
01:24:18,007 --> 01:24:19,235
Come on, you guys.

878
01:24:21,607 --> 01:24:23,006
Nice suits, fellas.

879
01:24:27,567 --> 01:24:31,037
A lot of amateur musicians
will wanna rap with these guys,

880
01:24:31,207 --> 01:24:34,916
and as soon as they're finished,
they'll be manning the phones.

881
01:24:35,687 --> 01:24:36,756
All right.

882
01:24:37,007 --> 01:24:39,202
What are we waiting for?
Take it away, guys.

883
01:24:57,727 --> 01:25:00,639
We know what that means.
Time to turn the big board over.

884
01:25:00,807 --> 01:25:02,718
l'm afraid you guys
will have to wait a few minutes.

885
01:25:02,887 --> 01:25:03,797
Jack!

886
01:25:04,287 --> 01:25:07,085
l don't know about you,
but l sense electricity in the air.

887
01:25:08,367 --> 01:25:09,595
Alright, what do you think?

888
01:25:10,047 --> 01:25:11,639
Okay, let's do it.

889
01:25:15,407 --> 01:25:16,522
Play some music!

890
01:25:16,687 --> 01:25:18,120
Go fuck yourself, bud.

891
01:25:22,527 --> 01:25:24,597
Who the hell do you
think you are, Liberace?

892
01:25:28,767 --> 01:25:29,882
Are you okay?

893
01:25:36,727 --> 01:25:38,558
We just passed the car, Jack.

894
01:25:39,887 --> 01:25:41,878
Where the hell are you going?
You going to talk to me?

895
01:25:42,487 --> 01:25:44,603
Or is this
Jack's famous silent act?

896
01:25:45,487 --> 01:25:47,205
lt was for publicity, understand?

897
01:25:47,367 --> 01:25:49,881
-Publicity!
-Are you a fucking moron?

898
01:25:51,127 --> 01:25:53,641
lt's three in the morning.
Who's watching, paper boys?

899
01:25:54,167 --> 01:25:56,203
l didn't know when
we were on till yesterday.

900
01:25:56,367 --> 01:25:58,676
-Basketballs.
-Okay.

901
01:25:58,887 --> 01:26:00,764
You had us playing
for basketballs.

902
01:26:00,927 --> 01:26:04,636
l screwed up, but that
you don't walk out on a gig.

903
01:26:05,767 --> 01:26:06,756
What?

904
01:26:07,447 --> 01:26:09,005
lt wasn't professional, Jack.

905
01:26:10,367 --> 01:26:14,360
What's happened to you?
Now you like kissing ass?

906
01:26:15,367 --> 01:26:18,325
You let that guy
turn us into clowns tonight.

907
01:26:19,567 --> 01:26:22,035
We were always small time.
We were never clowns.

908
01:26:24,847 --> 01:26:25,836
What's happened to your dignity.

909
01:26:27,727 --> 01:26:30,719
Who the hell are you
to talk about dignity?

910
01:26:30,887 --> 01:26:32,559
This where you get your dignity?

911
01:26:32,767 --> 01:26:34,758
Let's do it straight for once.

912
01:26:36,487 --> 01:26:38,478
l want to explain something
to you, little brother.

913
01:26:39,647 --> 01:26:42,241
There are people in this world
who depend on me.

914
01:26:42,767 --> 01:26:45,679
l got a wife and kids
who expect to wake up

915
01:26:45,847 --> 01:26:48,236
with food on the table
and heat in the house.

916
01:26:48,407 --> 01:26:50,967
l got a mortgage.
l got car payments.

917
01:26:51,127 --> 01:26:54,244
And l got you,
my little brother Jack.

918
01:26:54,527 --> 01:26:56,961
He's so hip, so cool and sure
that he's better than everyone.

919
01:26:57,127 --> 01:26:59,641
Don't you think l'd like to
walk up to one of those assholes

920
01:26:59,807 --> 01:27:01,081
and blow smoke in his face?

921
01:27:01,247 --> 01:27:02,839
God damn right l would!

922
01:27:03,967 --> 01:27:06,959
But l can't.
l have to be responsible.

923
01:27:07,127 --> 01:27:09,925
l have to make the numbers
balance in my favor every month

924
01:27:10,087 --> 01:27:13,204
so everyone else can
go on living their lives.

925
01:27:14,847 --> 01:27:18,556
There's no medals but you'd notice
if l closed up shop.

926
01:27:18,967 --> 01:27:23,085
Don't talk to me about dignity.
You're playing a weak hand.

927
01:27:24,407 --> 01:27:26,762
Terrific! Walk away.

928
01:27:27,407 --> 01:27:28,920
You're good at that, Jack.

929
01:27:29,167 --> 01:27:32,318
You never commit to anything.
Even a conversation.

930
01:27:33,087 --> 01:27:34,566
ls that what that was?

931
01:27:35,007 --> 01:27:36,679
Felt like a speech to me.

932
01:27:36,847 --> 01:27:39,156
Next time,
save it for the PTA.

933
01:27:39,407 --> 01:27:42,683
You couldn't keep
your cock in your pocket.

934
01:27:48,727 --> 01:27:50,001
Who l fuck...

935
01:27:50,767 --> 01:27:53,122
and who l don't fuck
is none of your fucking business.

936
01:27:53,287 --> 01:27:55,278
lt is when it effects my business.

937
01:27:55,807 --> 01:27:58,082
-Your business?
-Yeah.

938
01:27:58,927 --> 01:28:01,157
lt exists because of me.

939
01:28:01,847 --> 01:28:02,962
You?

940
01:28:05,607 --> 01:28:07,723
l make the calendar.
l pay the expenses.

941
01:28:07,887 --> 01:28:10,196
Christ, l even make sure
your shoes are shined.

942
01:28:10,487 --> 01:28:11,761
What do you do?

943
01:28:11,927 --> 01:28:13,963
You show up for a couple of hours
a night and smoke cigarettes.

944
01:28:14,287 --> 01:28:17,199
lf somebody requested ''Chopsticks''
you'd ask for the sheet music.

945
01:28:17,367 --> 01:28:21,155
lf not for me, you'd be playing
for dimes from the back of a truck.

946
01:28:21,647 --> 01:28:23,205
Yeah, you're a real pro, Frank.

947
01:28:24,007 --> 01:28:26,123
You did a bang up job:

948
01:28:26,287 --> 01:28:28,881
you had them paying us
not to play!

949
01:28:29,247 --> 01:28:30,566
That's fucking genius.

950
01:28:33,967 --> 01:28:35,400
Asshole, what are you doing?

951
01:28:36,367 --> 01:28:37,766
What the fuck are you doing?

952
01:28:39,767 --> 01:28:40,882
That is it!

953
01:28:41,607 --> 01:28:43,040
Jack!

954
01:28:52,567 --> 01:28:55,240
Fucking little brother
beat the shit out of you, huh?

955
01:28:55,887 --> 01:28:57,366
Jack, my hand!

956
01:29:04,727 --> 01:29:06,843
l'm through.
l can't do it anymore.

957
01:29:36,567 --> 01:29:38,876
You're one of those
Fabulous guys.

958
01:29:39,287 --> 01:29:41,676
-l remember.
-l don't remember.

959
01:29:42,207 --> 01:29:45,882
You can't kid me.
l see you here every night.

960
01:29:46,367 --> 01:29:48,835
That's why l took the job.

961
01:29:49,007 --> 01:29:52,443
l come in, l see you and
your brother's faces hanging there,

962
01:29:53,167 --> 01:29:55,158
l figured it was a sign.

963
01:29:55,967 --> 01:29:57,525
Like destiny.

964
01:30:00,887 --> 01:30:02,240
How are you doing, Monica?

965
01:30:02,487 --> 01:30:05,445
Well, only it's Blanche here.

966
01:30:05,887 --> 01:30:07,036
Don't touch that.

967
01:30:08,247 --> 01:30:10,044
That's three hours cold.

968
01:30:11,687 --> 01:30:15,965
l've been standing over here
waiting for you to wake up.

969
01:30:16,607 --> 01:30:20,919
Finally l figured maybe
you had an appointment.

970
01:30:21,687 --> 01:30:22,676
Here you go.

971
01:30:24,927 --> 01:30:26,201
Boy, it's weird, huh?

972
01:30:26,367 --> 01:30:30,121
You meet someone, think you'll
never see them again...

973
01:30:35,447 --> 01:30:38,086
Guess you got
caught in the rain, huh?

974
01:30:39,887 --> 01:30:41,684
Yeah, l got caught in the rain.

975
01:30:45,087 --> 01:30:46,315
What time do you punch out?

976
01:30:48,007 --> 01:30:48,996
What?

977
01:30:50,527 --> 01:30:51,960
What time do you punch out?

978
01:30:56,207 --> 01:30:57,925
You're my last ticket.

979
01:31:07,687 --> 01:31:09,678
Button up on the way home, Blanche.

980
01:31:12,047 --> 01:31:13,400
lt's cold out there.

981
01:31:31,407 --> 01:31:32,442
Hi, Jack.

982
01:31:33,087 --> 01:31:34,520
l took Eddie out.

983
01:31:42,167 --> 01:31:45,682
Be sure to take that tux in.
l can drop it off this afternoon.

984
01:31:47,687 --> 01:31:49,359
Will you stop that, please?

985
01:31:50,367 --> 01:31:51,925
Want me to make some coffee?

986
01:31:52,847 --> 01:31:55,156
How about l make some eggs?

987
01:31:58,127 --> 01:32:00,482
Knock if off with that thing.

988
01:32:00,647 --> 01:32:02,046
You're driving me nuts.

989
01:32:02,967 --> 01:32:04,923
Jack, you want eggs?
Jack, you want coffee?

990
01:32:05,087 --> 01:32:09,160
l can't baby-sit you every time
your mama gets an itch.

991
01:32:24,727 --> 01:32:25,876
What are you looking at?

992
01:33:03,847 --> 01:33:05,644
You're having a bad day, right?

993
01:33:09,167 --> 01:33:10,156
Right.

994
01:33:11,967 --> 01:33:12,956
lt's okay.

995
01:33:13,967 --> 01:33:17,118
My mom had a lot of those.
Sometimes that's why l came down.

996
01:33:33,487 --> 01:33:34,681
What do you say...

997
01:33:35,807 --> 01:33:38,401
we go over to the Empire
and grab a couple of Coneys?

998
01:33:39,207 --> 01:33:41,437
l can't. l'm going to
the zoo with Howard.

999
01:33:42,447 --> 01:33:43,436
Howard?

1000
01:33:44,287 --> 01:33:46,801
Mom says l can't call him
Bigfoot anymore.

1001
01:33:53,927 --> 01:33:55,360
l think he's early.

1002
01:34:12,487 --> 01:34:13,636
Teach you later?

1003
01:34:16,087 --> 01:34:19,284
You gonna play ''Jingle Bells''
the rest of your life?

1004
01:35:32,407 --> 01:35:34,921
l have Tuesdays
and Thursdays open.

1005
01:35:36,687 --> 01:35:38,245
They're yours if you want them.

1006
01:36:11,567 --> 01:36:13,717
-Everything goes. That the idea?
-No,...

1007
01:36:13,887 --> 01:36:16,162
l'm just getting too old
for trophy dens.

1008
01:36:16,327 --> 01:36:18,522
Anyway, it's a good place
for a workshop.

1009
01:36:18,967 --> 01:36:20,116
Workshop?

1010
01:36:21,527 --> 01:36:22,926
Yeah, workshop.

1011
01:36:23,807 --> 01:36:26,401
Hammers and saws and...

1012
01:36:27,327 --> 01:36:29,682
-...things like that.
-Let's cut the bullshit.

1013
01:36:29,847 --> 01:36:31,326
You came here
to talk business, right?

1014
01:36:32,047 --> 01:36:33,878
We'll put the other night behind us.

1015
01:36:34,047 --> 01:36:37,084
ln a couple of weeks,
it'll be the same. Now you can go.

1016
01:36:40,727 --> 01:36:42,365
l'm not coming back, Frank.

1017
01:36:47,727 --> 01:36:49,718
Then what's there to talk about?

1018
01:36:52,887 --> 01:36:53,763
Frank.

1019
01:36:56,007 --> 01:36:57,042
Listen.

1020
01:36:57,967 --> 01:37:00,845
lt's not you, understand?
lt's me.

1021
01:37:07,847 --> 01:37:11,965
l sit in the fucking Hilton
or the Sheraton

1022
01:37:12,207 --> 01:37:13,845
practically every night of my life.

1023
01:37:14,007 --> 01:37:16,965
And the moment l get on stage,
l can't wait flor it to end.

1024
01:37:18,367 --> 01:37:22,121
We play the same songs
the same way every night.

1025
01:37:23,447 --> 01:37:25,119
l just can't do it anymore.

1026
01:37:28,087 --> 01:37:30,442
l've been lying
to myself long enough.

1027
01:37:35,647 --> 01:37:37,205
You see anything you want, take it.

1028
01:37:56,367 --> 01:37:57,720
Okay if l take this?

1029
01:38:05,247 --> 01:38:07,158
Come on, Frank. l'm trying.

1030
01:38:11,607 --> 01:38:12,676
How's your hand?

1031
01:38:12,847 --> 01:38:16,283
My hand is fine.
Don't worry about me.

1032
01:38:16,447 --> 01:38:18,278
l don't need this any more than you.

1033
01:38:19,567 --> 01:38:22,001
l can make just as much
teaching ''Camptown Races''

1034
01:38:22,167 --> 01:38:24,317
to snotty kids in the neighborhood.

1035
01:38:27,607 --> 01:38:29,006
Don't fool yourself.

1036
01:38:45,367 --> 01:38:46,402
Open it.

1037
01:38:49,687 --> 01:38:51,484
Open the fucking bottle.

1038
01:38:57,927 --> 01:38:59,599
Let's see what we got here.

1039
01:38:59,767 --> 01:39:01,723
We got the airport Ramada.

1040
01:39:04,087 --> 01:39:05,964
The Travel Lodge on 410.

1041
01:39:07,407 --> 01:39:08,840
And we got...

1042
01:39:11,367 --> 01:39:12,516
the Mallory.

1043
01:39:12,727 --> 01:39:14,206
l'll take the Mallory.

1044
01:39:14,367 --> 01:39:16,835
Forget it. l want the Mallory.
You take the Travel Lodge.

1045
01:39:44,607 --> 01:39:45,881
Not bad!

1046
01:39:52,567 --> 01:39:54,876
When was the last time
we played the Mallory?

1047
01:39:55,087 --> 01:39:56,805
'78, November.

1048
01:39:58,367 --> 01:40:01,643
lt was someone's birthday.
Hallorin?

1049
01:40:02,727 --> 01:40:04,399
His daughter, sweet sixteen.

1050
01:40:05,007 --> 01:40:06,725
How could l forget?

1051
01:40:07,047 --> 01:40:08,526
What a nightmare.

1052
01:40:08,847 --> 01:40:10,166
She asked for it.

1053
01:40:10,327 --> 01:40:12,238
l told Howard we didn't
do vocals and he said:

1054
01:40:12,407 --> 01:40:14,045
''What my Sissie wants,

1055
01:40:14,607 --> 01:40:16,404
my Sissie gets''.

1056
01:40:23,047 --> 01:40:24,366
She got it alright.

1057
01:41:25,247 --> 01:41:27,044
You're risking your life.

1058
01:41:28,607 --> 01:41:29,756
You got a gun?

1059
01:41:30,487 --> 01:41:33,365
Car you're leaning on belongs to
a light heavyweight with attitude.

1060
01:41:34,967 --> 01:41:36,400
l'll take my chances.

1061
01:41:42,567 --> 01:41:43,636
You look good.

1062
01:41:44,647 --> 01:41:46,205
You look like shit.

1063
01:41:51,407 --> 01:41:52,999
No, l mean it. You look good.

1064
01:41:56,127 --> 01:41:58,277
l mean it, too.
You look like shit.

1065
01:42:01,007 --> 01:42:02,679
So how's the cat food business?

1066
01:42:05,407 --> 01:42:08,126
Terrific.
l'm doing vegetables now.

1067
01:42:10,247 --> 01:42:11,521
What kind?

1068
01:42:11,727 --> 01:42:12,716
Carrots,

1069
01:42:13,447 --> 01:42:14,641
peas.

1070
01:42:16,487 --> 01:42:18,125
None of the important ones.

1071
01:42:22,727 --> 01:42:24,046
You know...

1072
01:42:25,327 --> 01:42:26,442
the other night...

1073
01:42:27,407 --> 01:42:28,760
l was out of line.

1074
01:42:28,927 --> 01:42:30,406
No, l was out of line.

1075
01:42:37,247 --> 01:42:38,316
Well...

1076
01:42:39,567 --> 01:42:41,637
l was kind of rough on Egghead.

1077
01:42:44,327 --> 01:42:46,522
lt beats the hell out of me,
but l kind of miss him.

1078
01:42:47,487 --> 01:42:48,636
Well...

1079
01:42:52,247 --> 01:42:55,239
he grows on you,
after a while.

1080
01:42:58,247 --> 01:42:59,965
So, did you find another girl?

1081
01:43:02,247 --> 01:43:03,475
l didn't look.

1082
01:43:10,927 --> 01:43:11,916
Well...

1083
01:43:12,327 --> 01:43:13,646
l'm going to be late.

1084
01:43:15,407 --> 01:43:18,365
Peas, peas,
Try our peas.

1085
01:43:18,527 --> 01:43:21,121
Our peas are a delicacy.

1086
01:43:23,567 --> 01:43:25,762
From ''Strangers in the Night''
to that.

1087
01:43:26,207 --> 01:43:27,640
Funny world.

1088
01:43:33,927 --> 01:43:35,326
Well... bye, Baker.

1089
01:43:45,167 --> 01:43:46,520
Am l going to see you again?

1090
01:43:47,687 --> 01:43:48,881
What do you think?

1091
01:43:51,047 --> 01:43:52,036
Yeah,

1092
01:43:52,847 --> 01:43:54,838

1093
