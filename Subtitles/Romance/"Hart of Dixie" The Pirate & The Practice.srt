1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:03,178
<i>Harley Wilkes was your father.
He left you his practice.</i>

2
00:00:03,179 --> 00:00:05,647
You're the mayor?
Lavon Hayes, the linebacker?

3
00:00:05,648 --> 00:00:07,949
You share a generator
with Wade Kinsella.

4
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:09,985
I don't want you
getting any ideas.

5
00:00:11,521 --> 00:00:13,588
Notice how whenever I come
around, there's always sparks?

6
00:00:13,589 --> 00:00:15,222
How dare you see my patients?

7
00:00:15,223 --> 00:00:17,392
Well, technically, Harley left
his half of the practice to me.

8
00:00:17,393 --> 00:00:20,628
I'm not gonna share this office,
not for one minute.

9
00:00:20,629 --> 00:00:23,097
If one partner doesn't bring
in 30% of the revenue,

10
00:00:23,098 --> 00:00:26,033
every billing quarter, the other
partner can buy him or her out.

11
00:00:26,034 --> 00:00:28,002
I'm good at what I do,
and as soon as the town

12
00:00:28,003 --> 00:00:30,169
figures that out,
it'll be just fine.

13
00:00:32,072 --> 00:00:34,173
So Mom, you'll have
a car meeting me

14
00:00:34,174 --> 00:00:36,443
at the airport tonight?
Fantastic!

15
00:00:36,444 --> 00:00:38,278
Four whole days in New York!

16
00:00:39,747 --> 00:00:42,982
I am telling you,
I have earned it.

17
00:00:42,983 --> 00:00:47,219
Yeah. I finally got my 30%
of patients at the practice.

18
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:50,055
Now I can relax,
and have Thanksgiving

19
00:00:50,056 --> 00:00:51,857
the way it was intended.

20
00:00:51,858 --> 00:00:55,127
Jean Georges is catering, right?

21
00:00:55,128 --> 00:00:56,529
Thank God.

22
00:00:56,530 --> 00:01:00,832
I am craving elegance
and refinement.

23
00:01:00,833 --> 00:01:03,435
The BlueBellians
are probably re-enacting

24
00:01:03,436 --> 00:01:05,102
the Pilgrims and Indian
corn trading, and...

25
00:01:05,103 --> 00:01:08,205
giving... thanks...

26
00:01:10,375 --> 00:01:11,910
Or not.

27
00:01:11,911 --> 00:01:13,745
Mom, see you tonight.

28
00:01:13,746 --> 00:01:15,179
Bye.

29
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:18,449
I just saw the weirdest thing.

30
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:20,283
Shiver me timbers.

31
00:01:20,284 --> 00:01:22,686
Oh, hi. Hardtack?

32
00:01:22,687 --> 00:01:24,455
I knew this day would come.

33
00:01:24,456 --> 00:01:28,191
You softened me up with
heat waves and blue people,

34
00:01:28,192 --> 00:01:29,660
but I'm not falling for this.

35
00:01:29,661 --> 00:01:30,894
Oh, this is no joke.

36
00:01:30,895 --> 00:01:33,663
This is one of this town's

37
00:01:33,664 --> 00:01:36,131
- most revered traditions.
- The early selelers

38
00:01:36,132 --> 00:01:38,033
of BlueBell were doing
Thanksgiving things,

39
00:01:38,034 --> 00:01:39,435
shelling peas,
brining turkey...

40
00:01:39,436 --> 00:01:40,870
Watching football.

41
00:01:40,871 --> 00:01:43,272
Oh, no. Getting ready to
give thanks and chow down.

42
00:01:43,273 --> 00:01:44,974
When... whoosh!

43
00:01:44,975 --> 00:01:46,241
Big-ass hurricane...

44
00:01:46,242 --> 00:01:47,844
- Washes everything away.
- Gone.

45
00:01:47,845 --> 00:01:49,878
Crops, houses, stores,
all out to sea.

46
00:01:49,879 --> 00:01:51,780
But it washes some pirates in.

47
00:01:51,781 --> 00:01:54,282
- Pirates?
- Yes, pirates.

48
00:01:54,283 --> 00:01:55,650
But instead of pillaging,

49
00:01:55,651 --> 00:01:57,686
these pirates saw the
struggling people of BlueBell

50
00:01:57,687 --> 00:02:00,388
and gave them food and supplies
to get back on their feet.

51
00:02:00,389 --> 00:02:03,492
That's why, 200 years later,
instead of folks having

52
00:02:03,493 --> 00:02:06,927
turkeys at home, we honor
those pirates by dressing up

53
00:02:06,928 --> 00:02:08,629
and having a big fish fry

54
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:09,930
in the town square.

55
00:02:09,931 --> 00:02:11,264
Which we call...

56
00:02:11,265 --> 00:02:13,200
- Planksgiving.
- Bam.

57
00:02:13,201 --> 00:02:15,669
That is the single stupidest

58
00:02:15,670 --> 00:02:18,105
thing I've heard
since I moved here.

59
00:02:18,106 --> 00:02:19,339
And I hear Wade
talking to his dates

60
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:20,640
every night on his front porch.

61
00:02:20,641 --> 00:02:22,108
- Hey!
- Fine, I'm sure that your

62
00:02:22,109 --> 00:02:23,643
little fish fry is filled with

63
00:02:23,644 --> 00:02:26,312
as much adorableness
as it is cholesterol.

64
00:02:26,313 --> 00:02:30,449
But now I am doubly happy

65
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:33,452
to be flying to New York
to eat turkey with my mom.

66
00:02:33,453 --> 00:02:35,421
Wade, enjoy your holiday.

67
00:02:35,422 --> 00:02:36,955
Lavon, see you later.

68
00:02:36,956 --> 00:02:38,624
Please change before you
take me to the airport.

69
00:02:45,297 --> 00:02:47,666
You didn't tell me Zoe was
going away for the holidays.

70
00:02:47,667 --> 00:02:49,167
- I thought I did.
- Yeah. Well, you didn't.

71
00:02:51,504 --> 00:02:53,738
Means I can try my new amp out.

72
00:02:53,739 --> 00:02:55,205
She's always complaining about

73
00:02:55,206 --> 00:02:57,107
how I'm blowing out
the power, and all that.

74
00:02:57,108 --> 00:02:58,175
Speaking of which,
I-I need a favor.

75
00:03:02,714 --> 00:03:04,248
Bought a new fuse box.

76
00:03:04,249 --> 00:03:07,051
Need you to help me to
install it while Zoe's away.

77
00:03:07,052 --> 00:03:08,618
I'm sick and tired

78
00:03:08,619 --> 00:03:11,387
of hearing y'all squabble
over electricity all the time.

79
00:03:11,388 --> 00:03:13,089
Hey. That' a great idea.
We need it!

80
00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:15,992
But, uh... you're gonna
have to find somebody else

81
00:03:15,993 --> 00:03:17,027
to install it.

82
00:03:17,028 --> 00:03:18,394
What are you talking about?

83
00:03:18,395 --> 00:03:20,463
Oh, I don't do electrical.

84
00:03:20,464 --> 00:03:22,999
You know, car engines,
carpentry, absolutely.

85
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,233
But, uh, electrical
just ain't my thing.

86
00:03:25,234 --> 00:03:29,071
I'm sorry, but,
uh... another time.

87
00:03:29,072 --> 00:03:30,439
All right.

88
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:31,840
All right, you take
it easy, Lavon.

89
00:03:35,244 --> 00:03:37,112
- Oh, my God.
- Avast, fair maiden!

90
00:03:37,113 --> 00:03:40,848
Come with me and we
will sail the seven seas!

91
00:03:40,849 --> 00:03:42,684
Honestly, George,
I don't have time

92
00:03:42,685 --> 00:03:46,253
to play pirate,
your parents are coming!

93
00:03:46,254 --> 00:03:48,456
Oh. But it's, uh,
it's Planksgiving.

94
00:03:48,457 --> 00:03:52,493
And I plan on plundering
me some pirate booty.

95
00:03:52,494 --> 00:03:54,028
Mm-hmm.
Okay, well...

96
00:03:54,029 --> 00:03:56,730
I would gladly let you pillage
me all day, Pirate Tucker.

97
00:03:56,731 --> 00:04:00,000
But I have to clean
and go to the store

98
00:04:00,001 --> 00:04:02,202
because for some reason,
your parents decided to

99
00:04:02,203 --> 00:04:03,737
- crash our holiday.
- Okay.

100
00:04:03,738 --> 00:04:06,239
Well... I mean...

101
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:07,608
Y-you don't gotta
dust the outlets.

102
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:10,811
Is that hat on too tight?

103
00:04:10,812 --> 00:04:12,645
Your mother hates me.

104
00:04:12,646 --> 00:04:15,047
And the last time I saw her,
I had a breakdown at Fancie's.

105
00:04:16,249 --> 00:04:18,217
Look...

106
00:04:18,218 --> 00:04:19,852
if it makes you feel any better,

107
00:04:19,853 --> 00:04:21,887
my mama also hates Oprah,

108
00:04:21,888 --> 00:04:23,956
and Reese Witherspoon,

109
00:04:23,957 --> 00:04:25,658
and springtime,

110
00:04:25,659 --> 00:04:27,392
and the U.S. Women's
Soccer Team.

111
00:04:27,393 --> 00:04:29,861
Hey, so, you admit it,
she hates me.

112
00:04:29,862 --> 00:04:32,731
Baby, all that matters

113
00:04:32,732 --> 00:04:34,465
is that I think you are perfect

114
00:04:34,466 --> 00:04:36,400
just the way you...

115
00:04:36,401 --> 00:04:38,603
aregh!

116
00:04:42,274 --> 00:04:45,275
- Yep. Eleven.
- Well, now, count 'em again.

117
00:04:45,276 --> 00:04:46,777
Brick, I already
counted three times.

118
00:04:46,778 --> 00:04:50,480
Face it, Zoe got her 30% of
patients for this quarter.

119
00:04:50,481 --> 00:04:51,682
That is impossible,
'cause on Monday

120
00:04:51,683 --> 00:04:53,216
she was three patients shy.

121
00:04:53,217 --> 00:04:55,519
True, but then all four
MacKenzie brothers

122
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:57,621
got into a bar fight,
and Zoe stitched 'em up.

123
00:04:57,622 --> 00:04:59,489
Then afterwards, they called

124
00:04:59,490 --> 00:05:01,223
and asked for Zoe to
do their follow-up.

125
00:05:01,224 --> 00:05:02,925
You know the rules:
they request Zoe,

126
00:05:02,926 --> 00:05:04,460
she's counted as their doctor.

127
00:05:04,461 --> 00:05:06,129
Now wait a minute,
you're telling me that

128
00:05:06,130 --> 00:05:08,564
the MacKenzie brothers--
my patients--

129
00:05:08,565 --> 00:05:11,233
specifically requested
Zoe Hart to treat them?

130
00:05:11,234 --> 00:05:14,037
Now why in the hell
would they do that?

131
00:05:15,739 --> 00:05:17,505
♪ ♪

132
00:05:22,779 --> 00:05:24,646
That explains it.

133
00:05:26,415 --> 00:05:28,416
I am getting a cup of coffee.

134
00:05:30,653 --> 00:05:32,920
I take it he knows
about my 30%?

135
00:05:32,921 --> 00:05:34,722
Have to say, didn't
think you could do it.

136
00:05:34,723 --> 00:05:36,190
You've come a long way, missy.

137
00:05:36,191 --> 00:05:37,424
Well, the quarter's over,

138
00:05:37,425 --> 00:05:39,193
and my father's
legacy is intact.

139
00:05:39,194 --> 00:05:40,695
Now I'm going to New York City,

140
00:05:40,696 --> 00:05:43,164
where Zoe Hart can be a fish
in her own polluted water.

141
00:05:43,165 --> 00:05:45,599
Hey, Addy.
Is Brick in?

142
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:48,368
Oh, he just stepped out, but
I have his partner, Dr. Hart.

143
00:05:49,536 --> 00:05:51,871
Guess you'll have to do.

144
00:05:51,872 --> 00:05:53,840
Well, isn't that sweet?
And what brings you in today?

145
00:05:53,841 --> 00:05:58,011
Caleb has been complaining of
itchiness for the last two days.

146
00:05:58,012 --> 00:06:01,915
Me name be Small Cal No Beard!

147
00:06:01,916 --> 00:06:02,982
Of course it is.

148
00:06:02,983 --> 00:06:05,751
Right this way.

149
00:06:05,752 --> 00:06:08,220
Six more hours, six more hours,
six more hours...

150
00:06:09,689 --> 00:06:10,889
Hey, Lemon Meringue Pie!

151
00:06:10,890 --> 00:06:12,257
Oh, hi, Daddy.

152
00:06:12,258 --> 00:06:13,892
Hey. Can your old dad
buy you a cup of coffee?

153
00:06:13,893 --> 00:06:15,627
Oh, I'm...
I'm sorry.

154
00:06:15,628 --> 00:06:17,562
I'm running late. I gotta
buy those little onions

155
00:06:17,563 --> 00:06:19,497
the Tuckers like
in their martinis.

156
00:06:19,498 --> 00:06:21,565
'Cause Lord knows if they don't
have their teeny-tiny onions,

157
00:06:21,566 --> 00:06:25,069
then the whole earth is just
gonna spin off its axis.

158
00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:27,271
Ah, the Tuckers. Well, you know
your sister's so scared of them,

159
00:06:27,272 --> 00:06:28,806
she hightailed it to the
Richmans' for the weekend.

160
00:06:28,807 --> 00:06:30,908
- Oh. - Yeah. Well, at least we
only have to put up with them

161
00:06:30,909 --> 00:06:32,977
- a couple times a year.
- Yeah.

162
00:06:32,978 --> 00:06:35,813
Unlike a certain New York City
doctor who is a thorn

163
00:06:35,814 --> 00:06:38,248
in my backside on a daily basis.

164
00:06:38,249 --> 00:06:39,983
I thought you two were
getting along better.

165
00:06:39,984 --> 00:06:43,286
That girl still does not
get what it is to be a GP.

166
00:06:43,287 --> 00:06:46,556
I mean, you know, what it's like
to spend 30 years with a family,

167
00:06:46,557 --> 00:06:48,091
watching them change and grow.

168
00:06:48,092 --> 00:06:51,795
No, she swishes her little hips,
and steals my patients.

169
00:06:51,796 --> 00:06:53,262
Oh, Daddy, I just...

170
00:06:53,263 --> 00:06:55,064
Oh. I wish
there was a spell

171
00:06:55,065 --> 00:06:57,800
that we could use
to just blow Zoe Hart

172
00:06:57,801 --> 00:07:00,035
- right on out of this town.
- Yeah.

173
00:07:00,036 --> 00:07:02,138
Maybe she'd take the
Tuckers along with her.

174
00:07:02,139 --> 00:07:03,505
Oh, Olive! A word, please.

175
00:07:03,506 --> 00:07:06,275
Uh, you know, sweetheart...

176
00:07:06,276 --> 00:07:09,811
sometimes I think we gotta
make our own spells.

177
00:07:09,812 --> 00:07:11,579
Um... I'll talk to you later.

178
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:13,347
Uh, Olive? I just want to
tell you something...

179
00:07:14,850 --> 00:07:16,818
Seems to be mostly in his legs.

180
00:07:16,819 --> 00:07:18,386
Okay...

181
00:07:18,387 --> 00:07:20,588
Have you changed
laundry detergent?

182
00:07:20,589 --> 00:07:22,423
- Bought new sheets?
- No.

183
00:07:22,424 --> 00:07:24,425
What've you been up to, lately?

184
00:07:24,426 --> 00:07:25,826
Pillaging.

185
00:07:25,827 --> 00:07:28,962
Sailing the seven seas,
looking for treasure.

186
00:07:28,963 --> 00:07:31,464
He really loves Planksgiving.

187
00:07:31,465 --> 00:07:33,200
Well, he's a kid.

188
00:07:33,201 --> 00:07:35,568
He probably just rolled
around in some plant life.

189
00:07:35,569 --> 00:07:36,636
Hornswaggle!

190
00:07:36,637 --> 00:07:40,073
There be no plants
at sea, wench!

191
00:07:40,074 --> 00:07:43,776
Huh! That's Doctor Wench
to you, kid.

192
00:07:43,777 --> 00:07:46,078
He doesn't have a rash,
and his vitals are normal.

193
00:07:46,079 --> 00:07:48,747
I don't see any other symptoms.

194
00:07:48,748 --> 00:07:53,252
He's probably just having a mild
allergic reaction to something.

195
00:07:53,253 --> 00:07:54,921
Some antihistamines
should take care of it.

196
00:07:54,922 --> 00:07:56,588
Thanks so much.
We appreciate it.

197
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:03,128
One more patient
to add to my pile.

198
00:08:03,129 --> 00:08:05,797
Addy, can you, uh, see if I
can get on an earlier flight?

199
00:08:05,798 --> 00:08:07,498
I don't see any reason
why I couldn't make it.

200
00:08:07,499 --> 00:08:09,634
Okay, Tommy,
all medical records

201
00:08:09,635 --> 00:08:11,502
transferred back
to Dr. Breeland.

202
00:08:11,503 --> 00:08:14,205
Yes, your brothers
already called.

203
00:08:14,206 --> 00:08:17,141
All MacKenzies back
to Dr. Breeland.

204
00:08:17,142 --> 00:08:19,443
- Bye now.
- MacKenzies? My MacKenzies?

205
00:08:19,444 --> 00:08:21,011
Oh, no, they're my MacKenzies.

206
00:08:21,012 --> 00:08:22,746
See, I just happened
to bump into

207
00:08:22,747 --> 00:08:25,482
Tommy MacKenzie's wife, Olive.
Now the funny thing is,

208
00:08:25,483 --> 00:08:27,918
Olive had never heard that
her husband switched over

209
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:30,720
to the pretty lady doctor
in the short shorts.

210
00:08:33,057 --> 00:08:35,058
Brick, you've got
to be kidding me.

211
00:08:35,059 --> 00:08:37,393
I knew you wouldn't
be happy that I got my 30%,

212
00:08:37,394 --> 00:08:39,194
but I didn't think
you'd poach my patients.

213
00:08:40,396 --> 00:08:42,731
You did it first.

214
00:08:42,732 --> 00:08:44,666
- Oh, I most certainly did not.
- Oh, yes, you did.

215
00:08:44,667 --> 00:08:45,934
Oh, no, I did not.

216
00:08:45,935 --> 00:08:49,171
I treated them because
they asked to see me.

217
00:08:49,172 --> 00:08:50,805
I'll tell you what.

218
00:08:50,806 --> 00:08:53,742
You can have them if you can
name all four brothers.

219
00:08:53,743 --> 00:08:55,343
Fine.

220
00:08:55,344 --> 00:08:59,213
MacKenzie comma Tommy.

221
00:09:00,315 --> 00:09:03,617
Mackenzie comma...

222
00:09:03,618 --> 00:09:05,386
Logan.

223
00:09:05,387 --> 00:09:07,255
MacKenzie...

224
00:09:08,723 --> 00:09:10,324
MacKenzie...

225
00:09:10,325 --> 00:09:11,858
The other two didn't
speak that much.

226
00:09:11,859 --> 00:09:16,196
Well, you go on up to
New York, have a good time,

227
00:09:16,197 --> 00:09:19,998
and I'll just stay here
and buy you out.

228
00:09:19,999 --> 00:09:24,470
Oh. Enjoy your... Thanksgiving.

230
00:09:39,421 --> 00:09:42,323
Okay, how many more patients
do I need to make 30%?

231
00:09:42,324 --> 00:09:43,892
Well, you got Cap'n No Beard
this morning,

232
00:09:43,893 --> 00:09:45,260
so that puts you three shy.

233
00:09:45,261 --> 00:09:47,262
Well, I still have a couple
hours before my flight.

234
00:09:47,263 --> 00:09:49,097
You really think you can get
three patients by midnight?

235
00:09:49,098 --> 00:09:50,932
Not playing by the book, no.

236
00:09:55,904 --> 00:09:57,837
I was awfully surprised
to see y'all

237
00:09:57,838 --> 00:09:59,973
come down here
for Planksgiving.

238
00:09:59,974 --> 00:10:01,909
Well, thought
we'd mix thinin up.

239
00:10:01,910 --> 00:10:04,211
In fact, we've learned to
embrace a new tradition

240
00:10:04,212 --> 00:10:07,014
in Montgomery.
It's called Thanksgiving.

241
00:10:07,015 --> 00:10:10,416
We brought a turkey
with all the trimmings.

242
00:10:10,417 --> 00:10:12,718
Lemon, you and I can wake up
early and get started.

243
00:10:12,719 --> 00:10:14,520
I can see how your
cooking's coming along!

244
00:10:15,688 --> 00:10:16,722
Yay!

245
00:10:16,723 --> 00:10:18,891
I've always wanted to

246
00:10:18,892 --> 00:10:21,693
make a real Thanksgiving dinner.

247
00:10:21,694 --> 00:10:23,062
From scratch.

248
00:10:23,063 --> 00:10:24,630
For hours and hours...

249
00:10:24,631 --> 00:10:27,299
Look, Mom, thank you so much,
it's very nice of you,

250
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:29,634
but our tradition
is Planksgiving.

251
00:10:29,635 --> 00:10:32,804
George, you can have your
little fish fry next year.

252
00:10:32,805 --> 00:10:35,307
But this dinner is
our chance to celebrate.

253
00:10:35,308 --> 00:10:36,741
Celebrate what?

254
00:10:36,742 --> 00:10:38,343
Your brother, Harry...

255
00:10:38,344 --> 00:10:40,078
is going to run for
the state legislature!

256
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:42,313
- Well, that's, I mean that's,
that's great! - How exciting!

257
00:10:42,314 --> 00:10:44,614
- That's...
- A politician in the family.

258
00:10:44,615 --> 00:10:46,417
Yeah, that's great.

259
00:10:46,418 --> 00:10:48,185
Of course, that means that
Harry's gonna have to

260
00:10:48,186 --> 00:10:49,553
resign from the law firm.

261
00:10:49,554 --> 00:10:53,123
Leaving his position open.

262
00:10:56,027 --> 00:10:58,627
Look, Dad, we've
talked about this. Okay?

263
00:10:58,628 --> 00:11:00,997
I already left once
to do corporate law.

264
00:11:00,998 --> 00:11:03,299
It wasn't my thing
for many, many reasons.

265
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:06,269
I'm not leaving BlueBell again,
period.

266
00:11:06,270 --> 00:11:07,971
But that's the best part.

267
00:11:07,972 --> 00:11:09,872
Your father convinced
his partners

268
00:11:09,873 --> 00:11:11,574
to let you work from BlueBell!

269
00:11:11,575 --> 00:11:13,476
You'd only be in Montgomery
three days a week.

270
00:11:13,477 --> 00:11:15,444
The firm has housing
you can use.

271
00:11:15,445 --> 00:11:16,811
And, well, Lemon, that means

272
00:11:16,812 --> 00:11:19,414
that you'll have to join him

273
00:11:19,415 --> 00:11:21,583
on those days.

274
00:11:21,584 --> 00:11:26,388
Oh. Three days a week?
With you?

275
00:11:26,389 --> 00:11:27,789
That's just swell!

276
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:44,038
Okay, $100 for the first person

277
00:11:44,039 --> 00:11:48,108
to make a doctor's
appointment with me right now!

278
00:11:48,109 --> 00:11:51,344
Come on!

279
00:11:51,345 --> 00:11:54,147
Zoe, I'm sorry,
but um... Brick is our doctor.

280
00:11:54,148 --> 00:11:56,316
And we are a loyal bunch.

281
00:11:58,486 --> 00:12:00,453
Shelley!

282
00:12:00,454 --> 00:12:02,354
Shell! Shellster,

283
00:12:02,355 --> 00:12:04,356
Shellerino?

284
00:12:05,392 --> 00:12:06,791
I'm sorry, Zoe.

285
00:12:06,792 --> 00:12:08,960
I really am.
I think you're great.

286
00:12:08,961 --> 00:12:11,063
I really do.
It's just that I saw

287
00:12:11,064 --> 00:12:13,399
Brick for a checkup right
before you got here,

288
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:14,500
and I feel great.

289
00:12:14,501 --> 00:12:15,767
But you had a headache
the other day.

290
00:12:15,768 --> 00:12:17,302
It went away with two aspirin.

291
00:12:17,303 --> 00:12:18,569
You know, there was

292
00:12:18,570 --> 00:12:21,472
this case
of this guy with a headache.

293
00:12:21,473 --> 00:12:23,508
Turns out he had a whole set
of teeth

294
00:12:23,509 --> 00:12:25,043
growing behind his eyeballs.

295
00:12:31,116 --> 00:12:34,051
All right, meet you at your
office in a couple minutes.

296
00:12:39,457 --> 00:12:41,591
Hey, Tom...
Tommy!

297
00:12:41,592 --> 00:12:42,825
Oh, no, no, no.

298
00:12:42,826 --> 00:12:44,994
My mom will kill me

299
00:12:44,995 --> 00:12:46,863
if I see a doctor
other than Dr. Breeland.

300
00:12:46,864 --> 00:12:48,465
He delivered me!

301
00:12:48,466 --> 00:12:49,966
Come on, Tom.
I need new patients today.

302
00:12:51,334 --> 00:12:54,370
If you be my girlfriend
for a month.

303
00:12:54,371 --> 00:12:55,504
Okay.

304
00:12:55,505 --> 00:12:56,805
- Yeah?
- No.

305
00:12:56,806 --> 00:12:58,740
Oh... An ounce of
realism, please, Tom?

306
00:12:58,741 --> 00:12:59,975
Show me your boobs.

307
00:13:01,111 --> 00:13:02,511
One boob?

308
00:13:02,512 --> 00:13:04,380
How about you come
with me right now,

309
00:13:04,381 --> 00:13:07,148
and I won't tell your mother
what you just asked me to do?

310
00:13:08,350 --> 00:13:09,451
Deal.

311
00:13:09,452 --> 00:13:10,952
Okay.

312
00:13:10,953 --> 00:13:12,387
I cannot believe

313
00:13:12,388 --> 00:13:15,957
that we agreed to do
Thanksgiving dinner tomorrow.

314
00:13:15,958 --> 00:13:19,694
I mean, shoot, even if
it does get done by 7:00,

315
00:13:19,695 --> 00:13:21,162
we're gonna miss the
plank-walking contest!

316
00:13:21,163 --> 00:13:23,663
Plank-walking?
Really, George?

317
00:13:23,664 --> 00:13:26,166
That was your big takeaway
from lunch?

318
00:13:26,167 --> 00:13:29,803
Why, Lemon Breeland,
don't you know me at all?

319
00:13:29,804 --> 00:13:31,838
I'm not taking that job.

320
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:33,873
My dad doesn't even
respect me as a lawyer.

321
00:13:33,874 --> 00:13:35,875
The only reason he wants
me is 'cause Harry left

322
00:13:35,876 --> 00:13:38,744
and he wants to retain voting
majority with his partners.

323
00:13:38,745 --> 00:13:41,747
No, I have absolutely
no intention whatsoever

324
00:13:41,748 --> 00:13:44,250
of giving up my practice.

325
00:13:44,251 --> 00:13:46,486
Oh! Oh, my God, George,

326
00:13:46,487 --> 00:13:48,354
I love you so much right now!

327
00:13:48,355 --> 00:13:49,622
I was freaking out!

328
00:13:49,623 --> 00:13:51,157
I know.

329
00:13:51,158 --> 00:13:52,458
Oh! Okay,
so you know what?

330
00:13:52,459 --> 00:13:55,360
We will just pretend
like we thought about it,

331
00:13:55,361 --> 00:13:57,596
and after their Thanksgiving,

332
00:13:57,597 --> 00:13:59,464
we will just tell them no.

333
00:13:59,465 --> 00:14:02,267
Exactly. And then we can
celebrate this day

334
00:14:02,268 --> 00:14:03,935
like it's meant to be.

335
00:14:03,936 --> 00:14:06,204
With a fish fry, ruffled shirts

336
00:14:06,205 --> 00:14:07,071
and eye patches!

337
00:14:07,072 --> 00:14:08,806
Arrgh!

338
00:14:08,807 --> 00:14:11,308
There you two are!

339
00:14:11,309 --> 00:14:15,346
Oh, I was just on my way to buy
a few things for tomorrow.

340
00:14:15,347 --> 00:14:16,980
Lemon, would you like to come?

341
00:14:16,981 --> 00:14:19,517
Of course!

342
00:14:19,518 --> 00:14:23,020
Shopping with you, Clora?
Is there anything better?

343
00:14:28,192 --> 00:14:29,925
Hey-o!

344
00:14:29,926 --> 00:14:31,294
Whatcha working on, hoss?

345
00:14:31,295 --> 00:14:32,928
This was my grandmama's.
Just trying to fix it

346
00:14:32,929 --> 00:14:34,864
so I can give it back to her
for her birthday.

347
00:14:34,865 --> 00:14:36,199
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

348
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:38,168
Look, you got your
capacitors all wrong here.

349
00:14:38,169 --> 00:14:39,969
Check me out.

350
00:14:39,970 --> 00:14:41,804
Okay, no polarity.

351
00:14:41,805 --> 00:14:42,604
Mm-hmm.

352
00:14:42,605 --> 00:14:44,739
Yes polarity.

353
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:46,074
So you put that in wrong,

354
00:14:46,075 --> 00:14:48,310
when you plug it in,
it will explode.

355
00:14:48,311 --> 00:14:52,047
No more grandmama's radio,
no more fingers.

356
00:14:52,048 --> 00:14:52,681
Gotcha!

357
00:14:52,682 --> 00:14:54,316
What?

358
00:14:54,317 --> 00:14:55,517
This radio was a Wade trap.

359
00:14:55,518 --> 00:14:57,752
And you stuck
your big paw in it.

360
00:14:57,753 --> 00:14:59,353
Now you're mine.

361
00:14:59,354 --> 00:15:00,555
I don't know what you're
talking about.

362
00:15:00,556 --> 00:15:01,855
You lied to me

363
00:15:01,856 --> 00:15:03,957
this morning.
You can do electrical work.

364
00:15:03,958 --> 00:15:07,295
So? Maybe I didn't feel like
installing

365
00:15:07,296 --> 00:15:10,531
your new fuse box. So what?

366
00:15:10,532 --> 00:15:12,132
Exactly.
The question is why?

367
00:15:12,133 --> 00:15:15,835
After all, every time it blows,
Zoe comes stomping over

368
00:15:15,836 --> 00:15:17,571
and yells at you.

369
00:15:17,572 --> 00:15:20,240
But you know what Lavon Hayes
figured out?

370
00:15:20,241 --> 00:15:23,343
That only crackpots talk in
the third person?

371
00:15:23,344 --> 00:15:27,480
Ah, Lavon Hayes figured out that
you like Zoe coming over,

372
00:15:27,481 --> 00:15:30,416
which means you like Zoe.

373
00:15:30,417 --> 00:15:32,117
Look, if by "like" you mean
I'd do her?

374
00:15:32,118 --> 00:15:34,653
Sure, you got me.
I'd do her.

375
00:15:34,654 --> 00:15:36,589
But I'm not that picky.

376
00:15:36,590 --> 00:15:38,123
Mmm-mm, mmm-mm.
By "like," I mean

377
00:15:38,124 --> 00:15:42,993
<i>you love... her.</i>

378
00:15:42,994 --> 00:15:43,728
Hey.

379
00:15:43,729 --> 00:15:45,963
You are in big trouble.

380
00:15:45,964 --> 00:15:48,366
- What? - You know what
I just realized? A month ago

381
00:15:48,367 --> 00:15:50,668
you made a doctor's appointment
and then you canceled it.

382
00:15:50,669 --> 00:15:53,070
At least this guy had the good
sense to need stitches.

383
00:15:53,071 --> 00:15:54,638
I had a sore throat,
and it went away.

384
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:55,706
What's the big deal?

385
00:15:55,707 --> 00:15:57,274
Canceled patients don't count!

386
00:15:57,275 --> 00:16:00,277
Brick is about to take over the
practice, and I need patients.

387
00:16:00,278 --> 00:16:02,546
Zoe, I'd like to help you
out, but the thing is

388
00:16:02,547 --> 00:16:04,214
there nothing's bothering me.

389
00:16:04,215 --> 00:16:07,417
I-I don't want to be unethical
I'm the mayor of this town.

390
00:16:07,418 --> 00:16:10,553
Ow! Oh, ow! Ow!

391
00:16:10,554 --> 00:16:12,255
Now something's bothering you.

392
00:16:12,256 --> 00:16:14,257
Come on. Just stop in, and
then we'll go to the airport.

393
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:18,060
Oh, yeah, Lavon.

394
00:16:18,061 --> 00:16:20,529
Mmm! She is a real catch.

395
00:16:24,033 --> 00:16:27,435
That's three patients,
which brings me to 30%,

396
00:16:27,436 --> 00:16:29,137
which also means.

397
00:16:29,138 --> 00:16:30,639
"Ha-ha-ha, Brick Breeland."

398
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:32,674
If anyone needs me,
I'll be at Barney's.

399
00:16:32,675 --> 00:16:34,276
- Lavon, let's go.
- Not so fast.

400
00:16:35,811 --> 00:16:39,013
They just came in,
and they specifically asked

401
00:16:39,014 --> 00:16:41,316
for someone who was not you.

402
00:16:41,317 --> 00:16:44,385
So I wouldn't head
to that airport quite yet.

403
00:16:44,386 --> 00:16:45,286
You're still one shy.

404
00:16:51,328 --> 00:16:53,362
Caleb, are you okay?

405
00:16:53,363 --> 00:16:56,131
Me pirate fingers be aching.

406
00:16:56,132 --> 00:16:58,701
Dr. Hart, your services are
not needed here.

407
00:16:58,702 --> 00:17:00,401
Let me help.
Caleb is my patient.

408
00:17:00,402 --> 00:17:02,537
- Yeah, he was your patient.
- Exactly.

409
00:17:02,538 --> 00:17:04,973
Allergic reaction, my foot.

410
00:17:04,974 --> 00:17:07,508
He wasn't in pain this morning.
That's new.

411
00:17:07,509 --> 00:17:08,710
Let me examine him.

412
00:17:08,711 --> 00:17:10,211
Look, Dr. Hart,
maybe you should

413
00:17:10,212 --> 00:17:13,181
see me about having that wax
cleaned out of your ears.

414
00:17:13,182 --> 00:17:15,916
He is not your patient anymore.
Now go.

415
00:17:15,917 --> 00:17:18,218
Please go!

416
00:17:20,822 --> 00:17:22,022
What are his other symptoms?

417
00:17:22,023 --> 00:17:23,490
Joint pain and itchiness
are all we got.

418
00:17:23,491 --> 00:17:26,694
Blood panel including CBC,

419
00:17:26,695 --> 00:17:29,296
chem 7 and tox screen?

420
00:17:29,297 --> 00:17:31,331
- Brick has no idea what Caleb has.
- Nope.

421
00:17:31,332 --> 00:17:34,133
So if I diagnose him first,

422
00:17:34,134 --> 00:17:36,936
then maybe his mother
will rename me as his doctor.

423
00:17:36,937 --> 00:17:41,841
You'd also have the satisfaction
of treating a sick kid.

424
00:17:41,842 --> 00:17:43,643
That, too.

425
00:17:43,644 --> 00:17:45,111
Shady, I gotta tell ya

426
00:17:45,112 --> 00:17:47,413
I am a little surprised that
you want to sell the store.

427
00:17:47,414 --> 00:17:50,348
I mean, Nate's Hardware has

428
00:17:50,349 --> 00:17:53,051
been in your family for,
forever. And this price?

429
00:17:53,052 --> 00:17:55,087
I mean, I gotta say, no offense,

430
00:17:55,088 --> 00:17:57,923
but it's a little low,
don't you think?

431
00:17:57,924 --> 00:18:01,426
Yeah, but, uh, you know,

432
00:18:01,427 --> 00:18:03,294
it's, it's about
a life change, George.

433
00:18:03,295 --> 00:18:06,230
I mean, I've been tied to my
great-grandpa's store

434
00:18:06,231 --> 00:18:07,598
for way too long now.

435
00:18:07,599 --> 00:18:09,734
And my family and I, we're just
ready to move on.

436
00:18:09,735 --> 00:18:13,203
Wait. Are you leaving BlueBell?

437
00:18:13,204 --> 00:18:14,739
Let's face it, George.

438
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:16,507
There's bigger and better out
there in this world.

439
00:18:16,508 --> 00:18:18,275
And I intend to find it.

440
00:18:18,276 --> 00:18:21,678
Wow.

441
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:24,514
Well, okay. I will draw up
the paperwork for you.

442
00:18:24,515 --> 00:18:27,717
And I'll see you, say,
this afternoon?

443
00:18:27,718 --> 00:18:29,853
All right.
Thank you much, George.

444
00:18:29,854 --> 00:18:31,254
You're welcome.

445
00:18:32,957 --> 00:18:34,957
- How ya doing?
- Afternoon.

446
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:38,694
Real estate deals?

447
00:18:38,695 --> 00:18:40,763
A paralegal could handle that.

448
00:18:40,764 --> 00:18:42,364
Hell, a secretary could.

449
00:18:42,365 --> 00:18:43,766
Yeah. I don't mind it.

450
00:18:43,767 --> 00:18:45,134
Well, it's a waste of time

451
00:18:45,135 --> 00:18:47,136
that could be used doing things
of value.

452
00:18:47,137 --> 00:18:51,439
That's the beauty of working
with a large firm-- resources.

453
00:18:55,844 --> 00:18:57,979
My secretary's at
the beauty salon.

454
00:18:57,980 --> 00:18:59,380
- Uh-huh.
- It's a standing appointment.

455
00:18:59,381 --> 00:19:00,982
George Tucker.

456
00:19:02,918 --> 00:19:04,451
Okay, itching and joint pain
could indicate

457
00:19:04,452 --> 00:19:05,553
a hundred different things.

458
00:19:05,554 --> 00:19:06,954
Did Caleb give any other clues?

459
00:19:06,955 --> 00:19:09,189
Only about marauding
and swashbuckling.

460
00:19:09,190 --> 00:19:13,160
Well, the kid's clearly weird.
Maybe there's a clue in that.

461
00:19:13,161 --> 00:19:15,261
He's not weird. He's ten, Zoe.

462
00:19:15,262 --> 00:19:16,329
And this is how

463
00:19:16,330 --> 00:19:17,664
ten-year-old boys behave.

464
00:19:17,665 --> 00:19:19,599
Yeah, and ten-year-olds
are weird.

465
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:20,701
This how I nearly failed
my peds rotation.

466
00:19:20,702 --> 00:19:22,936
I need more information.

467
00:19:22,937 --> 00:19:24,837
I need eyes and ears
in that room.

468
00:19:24,838 --> 00:19:26,906
Hey, this is
a great magazine.

469
00:19:26,907 --> 00:19:28,741
Who knew electrophysiologists shop

470
00:19:28,742 --> 00:19:31,143
for bulk toilet paper
just like us?

471
00:19:31,144 --> 00:19:33,278
- Oh, we need to get to the airport.
- Lavon...

472
00:19:34,314 --> 00:19:36,281
How much do you love me?

473
00:19:36,282 --> 00:19:38,017
Why?

474
00:19:42,888 --> 00:19:45,724
Oh, hey, this isn't
the bathroom.

475
00:19:47,093 --> 00:19:48,626
What's up, Captain No Beard?

476
00:19:50,429 --> 00:19:53,198
There's something

477
00:19:53,199 --> 00:19:56,166
very soothing about
shelling peas, isn't there?

478
00:19:56,167 --> 00:19:59,002
Reminds me of a simpler time,

479
00:19:59,003 --> 00:20:01,805
a time when family
meant everything.

480
00:20:03,241 --> 00:20:06,744
You know, you and I are going
to be family very soon,

481
00:20:06,745 --> 00:20:09,679
so I think it's time
we had a frank conversation.

482
00:20:10,749 --> 00:20:12,248
Whatever about, Clora?

483
00:20:12,249 --> 00:20:15,384
Lemon, you don't have
to pretend.

484
00:20:15,385 --> 00:20:18,687
We both know that things
aren't right between us.

485
00:20:18,688 --> 00:20:21,124
We've gotten off
on the wrong foot,

486
00:20:21,125 --> 00:20:23,960
and I'm big enough to admit
that's all my fault.

487
00:20:27,264 --> 00:20:28,797
I had a practice
in BlueBell, too, son.

488
00:20:28,798 --> 00:20:32,634
I, I know that small town law
can get a little, uh, small.

489
00:20:32,635 --> 00:20:34,069
Yeah, I mean,

490
00:20:34,070 --> 00:20:36,437
Lovey Swann over at the
library is actually having me

491
00:20:36,438 --> 00:20:39,407
sue Parker Mason over
an overdue library book.

492
00:20:40,810 --> 00:20:43,878
But, Dad, come on,
you, you know

493
00:20:43,879 --> 00:20:45,312
I love helping
out my community.

494
00:20:45,313 --> 00:20:47,614
You could still help them.

495
00:20:47,615 --> 00:20:48,849
With a big firm behind you,

496
00:20:48,850 --> 00:20:50,484
you could make
some real changes around here.

497
00:20:50,485 --> 00:20:53,153
Class actions, defense teams.

498
00:20:53,154 --> 00:20:54,487
Lemon, I get it.

499
00:20:54,488 --> 00:20:56,823
Why in the world would you
let George take this job?

500
00:20:56,824 --> 00:20:58,491
You don't want him around us

501
00:20:58,492 --> 00:21:01,161
because you don't want
to be around us.

502
00:21:01,162 --> 00:21:04,998
I mean, you have been a,
a tad bit critical of me.

503
00:21:04,999 --> 00:21:06,900
I've been a judgmental hag.

504
00:21:06,901 --> 00:21:09,067
I know what kind
of lawyer you are.

505
00:21:09,068 --> 00:21:11,670
More importantly, I know
what kind of man you are.

506
00:21:12,972 --> 00:21:15,274
The crazy part is,

507
00:21:15,275 --> 00:21:17,409
I always wanted a girl,

508
00:21:17,410 --> 00:21:19,411
but instead, just boys.

509
00:21:21,647 --> 00:21:25,516
And here you are,
the daughter I always wanted,

510
00:21:25,517 --> 00:21:29,653
and instead of embracing you,
I turn my back.

511
00:21:29,654 --> 00:21:30,587
Truth is...

512
00:21:32,324 --> 00:21:35,193
your brother doesn't have
half your smarts

513
00:21:35,194 --> 00:21:36,694
or half your heart.

514
00:21:36,695 --> 00:21:39,063
I need you at my firm, son.

515
00:21:41,265 --> 00:21:44,067
George, I need you.

516
00:21:49,707 --> 00:21:51,842
Lemon,

517
00:21:51,843 --> 00:21:55,411
I know you've missed having
a mother in your life.

518
00:21:55,412 --> 00:21:58,347
And I want to be that for you.

519
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:06,755
Well?

520
00:22:06,756 --> 00:22:09,325
I heard coughing and
Caleb said he was dizzy.

521
00:22:09,326 --> 00:22:10,559
Anything else?
Anything at all?

522
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:14,262
Uh... He was scratching
behind his ear a lot.

523
00:22:16,565 --> 00:22:17,798
Huh.

524
00:22:17,799 --> 00:22:19,267
Maybe he finally does
have a rash.

525
00:22:19,268 --> 00:22:20,902
Could you go look at it?

526
00:22:20,903 --> 00:22:22,737
Are you crazy?

527
00:22:22,738 --> 00:22:25,874
The mayor of BlueBell can't be
creeping around exam rooms.

528
00:22:25,875 --> 00:22:28,675
And how many times can I lose
my way to the bathroom?

529
00:22:40,521 --> 00:22:42,856
Oh, for Pete's sake!

530
00:22:50,964 --> 00:22:52,899
Hey, babe.

531
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:54,934
- Hi.
- I was just going to call you.

532
00:22:54,935 --> 00:22:56,635
Listen, I've been thinking--

533
00:22:56,636 --> 00:22:58,537
I know it isn't
what we discussed,

534
00:22:58,538 --> 00:23:01,106
but maybe we should consider
your father's offer.

535
00:23:01,107 --> 00:23:04,009
That's funny, 'cause Lemon,

536
00:23:04,010 --> 00:23:06,511
I was thinking
the exact same thing, I mean...

537
00:23:06,512 --> 00:23:09,281
it turns out my dad really does
want me there, and...

538
00:23:09,282 --> 00:23:11,349
And it's a great
career opportunity.

539
00:23:11,350 --> 00:23:14,685
Plus, your mother and I
have had a breakthrough.

540
00:23:14,686 --> 00:23:18,188
Really? Wow.

541
00:23:18,189 --> 00:23:20,291
So we're really doing this?

542
00:23:20,292 --> 00:23:24,161
I think we are--
Senior Associate Tucker.

543
00:23:29,134 --> 00:23:31,568
So, did you see the rash?

544
00:23:31,569 --> 00:23:34,170
No rash. It was
just salt residue.

545
00:23:34,171 --> 00:23:35,939
We're back to square one.

546
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:38,007
Why would Caleb have
salt behind his ear?

547
00:23:38,008 --> 00:23:41,444
Like salt water? Residue you get
from swimming in the ocean.

548
00:23:41,445 --> 00:23:43,679
Okay, so Caleb has been
swimming in the bay.

549
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:44,780
Maybe there's something
in that.

550
00:23:44,781 --> 00:23:47,450
Itching, joint pain,

551
00:23:47,451 --> 00:23:49,084
ocean...

552
00:23:51,521 --> 00:23:54,656
- Zoe, you okay? - Addie, I know what's
wrong with Caleb. Call an ambulance.

553
00:24:03,423 --> 00:24:06,225
- You've been scuba diving, haven't you?
- Are you out of your mind?

554
00:24:06,226 --> 00:24:08,260
Caleb is only ten years old.

555
00:24:08,261 --> 00:24:10,395
He doesn't even know
how to scuba dive.

556
00:24:10,396 --> 00:24:13,498
This morning he said he was sailing
the seven seas looking for treasure.

557
00:24:13,499 --> 00:24:16,835
He also told me he made his
principal walk the plank.

558
00:24:16,836 --> 00:24:19,671
Maybe we should dredge
the bay for Mr. Babcock.

559
00:24:19,672 --> 00:24:22,306
- Caleb...
- Me name be Captain Cal No Beard.

560
00:24:22,307 --> 00:24:25,443
Fine. Captain No Beard, you have
to tell the truth right now.

561
00:24:25,444 --> 00:24:28,246
If you've been diving, you're only
going to get sicker and sicker.

562
00:24:28,247 --> 00:24:30,914
How dare you scare him.
He's just a boy.

563
00:24:30,915 --> 00:24:33,350
Look, you are out of this room,
you are out of this practice.

564
00:24:33,351 --> 00:24:35,152
Me hast been diving.

565
00:24:35,153 --> 00:24:36,286
What do you mean?

566
00:24:36,287 --> 00:24:37,921
You don't know how
to scuba dive.

567
00:24:37,922 --> 00:24:40,724
Me brother Nate taught me.

568
00:24:40,725 --> 00:24:42,459
Me robbed him of his suit.

569
00:24:44,262 --> 00:24:46,396
And took to the bay.

570
00:24:46,397 --> 00:24:47,830
Nate has scuba gear

571
00:24:47,831 --> 00:24:49,432
because he's 17
and taken lessons.

572
00:24:49,433 --> 00:24:51,434
Caleb, what were you thinking?

573
00:24:51,435 --> 00:24:54,437
Becky, Caleb has
decompression sickness.

574
00:24:54,438 --> 00:24:56,439
It's what divers
call the bends.

575
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:59,709
We have an ambulance coming, and he needs to
get into a hyperbaric chamber right away.

576
00:24:59,710 --> 00:25:02,378
I know it sounds scary,
but as long as we

577
00:25:02,379 --> 00:25:04,946
take care of it quickly he'll be fine.
And when he comes back,

578
00:25:04,947 --> 00:25:06,848
he'll come in for
a follow-up with me.

579
00:25:11,821 --> 00:25:14,890
See, Crickett, it was all
just a big misunderstanding

580
00:25:14,891 --> 00:25:18,025
like she was a mama lion
protecting her cub.

581
00:25:18,026 --> 00:25:19,927
Montgomery?

582
00:25:19,928 --> 00:25:22,263
I still can't believe
you're going to be bi-citial.

583
00:25:22,264 --> 00:25:23,931
Crickett, that's
not even a word, sweetie.

584
00:25:23,932 --> 00:25:27,635
But BlueBell
will always be my home.

585
00:25:27,636 --> 00:25:29,704
But what about
your civic duties?

586
00:25:29,705 --> 00:25:31,573
How are we gonna
get on without you?

587
00:25:31,574 --> 00:25:35,342
Oh, well, you'll
just have to forge on.

588
00:25:35,343 --> 00:25:37,911
Oh, if you'll excuse me,

589
00:25:37,912 --> 00:25:40,714
I have to go help my future
in-laws shop for Thanksgiving.

590
00:25:40,715 --> 00:25:42,949
I can't believe George
caved so quickly.

591
00:25:42,950 --> 00:25:46,353
- Nice work today.
- Well, I knew Lemon was key

592
00:25:46,354 --> 00:25:47,754
- to getting him on board.
- Mm-hmm.

593
00:25:47,755 --> 00:25:51,490
Of course, I practically
had to promise to breastfeed her

594
00:25:51,491 --> 00:25:53,359
to get her over on our side.

595
00:26:01,735 --> 00:26:03,736
You know, Shady,
you coming in earlier,

596
00:26:03,737 --> 00:26:06,971
you, uh, you sort of inspired
me to make a change, too.

597
00:26:06,972 --> 00:26:08,607
Oh, yeah? How's that?

598
00:26:08,608 --> 00:26:13,278
Well, I... I'm going
to close up shop here,

599
00:26:13,279 --> 00:26:15,647
and I'm going to go
join a larger firm.

600
00:26:15,648 --> 00:26:19,751
Congratulations, George.
That's-- that's great.

601
00:26:19,752 --> 00:26:23,354
Is everything okay, Shady?

602
00:26:23,355 --> 00:26:24,388
Hold on a sec.

603
00:26:24,389 --> 00:26:26,757
Of course.

604
00:26:26,758 --> 00:26:29,159
Hello?

605
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:31,428
I'll be right there.

606
00:26:31,429 --> 00:26:33,464
Wait, Shady, what...? Shady?

607
00:26:33,465 --> 00:26:35,299
Come... oh!

608
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:36,967
Turn around.

609
00:26:36,968 --> 00:26:38,934
Come on.

610
00:26:38,935 --> 00:26:41,504
Thought you were taking
Zoe to the airport.

611
00:26:44,708 --> 00:26:46,576
She had a last-minute
medical emergency,

612
00:26:46,577 --> 00:26:48,578
- so, she got a later flight.
- Oh.

613
00:26:48,579 --> 00:26:50,146
Said she'll call
when she's ready.

614
00:26:50,147 --> 00:26:52,715
You know, I've been thinking,
if you did like Zoe...

615
00:26:52,716 --> 00:26:54,949
I don't, all right?

616
00:26:54,950 --> 00:26:56,585
Uh-huh. So, my idea--

617
00:26:56,586 --> 00:26:58,587
you take her to the airport.

618
00:26:58,588 --> 00:27:02,223
Tell her how you feel right
before she gets on the plane.

619
00:27:02,224 --> 00:27:05,160
Now, if she feels the same,
you have yourself a nice,

620
00:27:05,161 --> 00:27:07,262
romantic, airport good-bye kiss.

621
00:27:07,263 --> 00:27:09,130
If she doesn't,

622
00:27:09,131 --> 00:27:12,566
she gets on the plane,
and no one has to talk about it.

623
00:27:15,370 --> 00:27:17,237
I don't like her, okay?

624
00:27:20,509 --> 00:27:21,809
Mm-hmm.

625
00:27:21,810 --> 00:27:24,779
Now, if you please.

626
00:27:24,780 --> 00:27:26,680
Flight leaves at 8:00.

627
00:27:28,316 --> 00:27:29,148
Hmm.

628
00:27:35,022 --> 00:27:37,056
There you two are!

629
00:27:37,057 --> 00:27:39,459
I made a reservation
for us at Fancie's

630
00:27:39,460 --> 00:27:40,727
in a half an hour.

631
00:27:40,728 --> 00:27:41,993
Harold, a martini?

632
00:27:41,994 --> 00:27:43,261
Sounds good to me.

633
00:27:43,262 --> 00:27:47,232
Great. Oh, and I got that gouda
you like, Mama.

634
00:27:47,233 --> 00:27:49,435
It is okay
if I call you Mama, right?

635
00:27:56,710 --> 00:27:58,909
- Shady!
- Caleb, are you okay?

636
00:27:58,910 --> 00:28:00,244
I'm sorry.

637
00:28:00,245 --> 00:28:02,079
Why were
you scuba diving?

638
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:03,147
I wanted
to find the pirate treasure.

639
00:28:03,148 --> 00:28:05,582
What-What pirate treasure?

640
00:28:05,583 --> 00:28:07,283
From the ship
in the Planksgiving story.

641
00:28:07,284 --> 00:28:09,152
I thought if I could find it,

642
00:28:09,153 --> 00:28:10,887
you wouldn't have
to sell the store,

643
00:28:10,888 --> 00:28:13,657
and we wouldn't have to
move in with Aunt Glenese,

644
00:28:13,658 --> 00:28:16,360
and you wouldn't have to go away
to look for work.

645
00:28:16,361 --> 00:28:17,427
We could stay a family.

646
00:28:22,098 --> 00:28:24,933
Look, I... I didn't want anyone
to know.

647
00:28:24,934 --> 00:28:27,503
All right? Everyone's
been buying their supplies

648
00:28:27,504 --> 00:28:29,071
off the Internet lately.

649
00:28:33,343 --> 00:28:36,478
Son, I appreciate
what you tried to do, but...

650
00:28:36,479 --> 00:28:38,713
there isn't any pirate treasure.

651
00:28:38,714 --> 00:28:40,948
It's just some story
somebody made up

652
00:28:40,949 --> 00:28:42,684
a long time ago.

653
00:28:44,887 --> 00:28:46,721
We should go.

654
00:28:52,894 --> 00:28:54,728
Wait!

655
00:28:56,163 --> 00:28:58,999
I don't want it anymore.

656
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,301
If there's no treasure,

657
00:29:01,302 --> 00:29:03,470
I can't help them.

658
00:29:05,740 --> 00:29:08,941
I just wanted my family
to stay together.

659
00:29:16,850 --> 00:29:18,684
Hey.

660
00:29:20,654 --> 00:29:22,955
So, we going to the
airport or what?

661
00:29:31,310 --> 00:29:32,910
A ten-year-old

662
00:29:32,911 --> 00:29:34,145
with the bends.

663
00:29:34,146 --> 00:29:35,545
I mean, I can't believe it.

664
00:29:35,546 --> 00:29:37,081
No, you can't blame
yourself about that.

665
00:29:37,082 --> 00:29:39,116
Me, on the other hand--
I mean, Shady Hilson wanting

666
00:29:39,117 --> 00:29:41,251
to sell his hardware store--
I should have known better.

667
00:29:41,252 --> 00:29:43,053
George, you never
could have known.

668
00:29:43,054 --> 00:29:45,389
Neither of us could have, but...

669
00:29:45,390 --> 00:29:48,025
- We're gonna have to figure out a way
to help them. - I completely agree.

670
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:52,628
What happened to Lavon?

671
00:29:52,629 --> 00:29:55,898
Uh, yeah, well, I, uh...

672
00:29:55,899 --> 00:29:58,001
I happened to be going
to the airport anyway,

673
00:29:58,002 --> 00:29:59,702
so...

674
00:29:59,703 --> 00:30:02,638
I do that sometimes
to visit my buddy

675
00:30:02,639 --> 00:30:05,875
the, uh... bag guy.

676
00:30:07,377 --> 00:30:10,078
So, it's not a special
trip or anything.

677
00:30:10,079 --> 00:30:11,613
You know, kids--

678
00:30:11,614 --> 00:30:14,983
they get so caught up
in stories and fantasies.

679
00:30:14,984 --> 00:30:19,087
You feel like a jerk when
their little hearts get broken.

680
00:30:19,088 --> 00:30:21,223
Really don't know what
you're talking about.

681
00:30:21,224 --> 00:30:24,125
So, the airport?

682
00:30:24,126 --> 00:30:27,694
Hey, y'all, can you give us a
ride back to the Breeland house?

683
00:30:27,695 --> 00:30:30,231
We got a lot of work to do, and
every minute's gonna count.

684
00:30:30,232 --> 00:30:32,133
- Uh, actually....
- Yeah, sure, hop in.

685
00:30:32,134 --> 00:30:33,267
Thanks.

686
00:30:33,268 --> 00:30:35,569
Is it this?

687
00:30:35,570 --> 00:30:38,172
- But...
- No...

688
00:30:38,173 --> 00:30:39,472
- Ow. Ow.
- Wade...

689
00:30:39,473 --> 00:30:40,440
- Watch the...
- Ooh, sorry.

690
00:30:40,441 --> 00:30:41,641
All right.

691
00:30:41,642 --> 00:30:42,842
Thank you.

692
00:30:42,843 --> 00:30:43,876
Ah.

693
00:30:43,877 --> 00:30:45,512
Welcome aboard.

694
00:30:45,513 --> 00:30:48,415
You know, Mama,
Dad, I've been thinking.

695
00:30:48,416 --> 00:30:50,316
You know, George and I don't
need our own place

696
00:30:50,317 --> 00:30:51,751
in Montgomery
for only three days a week.

697
00:30:51,752 --> 00:30:52,885
We can just stay with you.

698
00:30:52,886 --> 00:30:54,554
Won't that be

699
00:30:54,555 --> 00:30:56,821
- so cozy?
- Of course, dear.

700
00:30:56,822 --> 00:30:58,257
Oh, we can play charades
every night.

701
00:30:58,258 --> 00:30:59,058
I just love charades.

702
00:30:59,059 --> 00:31:00,025
Don't you?

703
00:31:00,026 --> 00:31:01,927
Wait. Guess this one.

704
00:31:07,267 --> 00:31:11,369
Sure hope we're not
late to the airport.

705
00:31:11,370 --> 00:31:12,870
Somebody's got a
plane to catch.

706
00:31:12,871 --> 00:31:14,505
You know
what we should do?

707
00:31:14,506 --> 00:31:16,107
- We should call the town council.
- Yeah.

708
00:31:16,108 --> 00:31:17,741
They got to have some jobs
for, uh... for Nate's.

709
00:31:17,742 --> 00:31:19,810
You guys are gonna help Caleb
and his family?

710
00:31:19,811 --> 00:31:21,145
You're more
than welcome to join us

711
00:31:21,146 --> 00:31:22,547
if you want to change
your travel plans.

712
00:31:22,548 --> 00:31:24,282
No, my mom's expecting me.

713
00:31:24,283 --> 00:31:26,150
I already saved the kid's life,
got him to the hospital.

714
00:31:26,151 --> 00:31:27,618
What more could I do?

715
00:31:27,619 --> 00:31:29,352
Well, you know, my
business card says doctor,

716
00:31:29,353 --> 00:31:30,454
and George's says lawyer,

717
00:31:30,455 --> 00:31:32,155
but those titles
don't begin to explain

718
00:31:32,156 --> 00:31:33,991
what people like us mean
to the community.

719
00:31:33,992 --> 00:31:35,593
I mean, BlueBell counts on us.

720
00:31:35,594 --> 00:31:36,927
What are you gonna do?

721
00:31:36,928 --> 00:31:39,029
Find the Hilsons some
Planksgiving buried treasure?

722
00:31:39,030 --> 00:31:40,931
You don't get it.

723
00:31:40,932 --> 00:31:42,165
You know, years ago,

724
00:31:42,166 --> 00:31:44,300
when BlueBell was leveled

725
00:31:44,301 --> 00:31:46,703
by that hurricane,
and people lost everything,

726
00:31:46,704 --> 00:31:48,838
most of all, they lost hope.

727
00:31:48,839 --> 00:31:50,607
They were talking
about moving out,

728
00:31:50,608 --> 00:31:53,375
deserting the town
and-and starting over,

729
00:31:53,376 --> 00:31:57,714
but the town's founder,
Cyrus Lavinius Jeremiah Jones,

730
00:31:57,715 --> 00:32:00,115
you know, he got together
with some of the town leaders.

731
00:32:00,116 --> 00:32:01,249
They spent

732
00:32:01,250 --> 00:32:02,985
the whole night fishing,

733
00:32:02,986 --> 00:32:05,954
and the next morning,
there was food for everyone.

734
00:32:05,955 --> 00:32:08,690
Yeah. Then, when people asked,

735
00:32:08,691 --> 00:32:10,692
"Where did it all come from?"

736
00:32:10,693 --> 00:32:14,229
that's when Cyrus made up that
story about friendly pirates.

737
00:32:14,230 --> 00:32:16,330
I knew there weren't pirates.

738
00:32:16,331 --> 00:32:19,233
Yeah, no pirates.

739
00:32:19,234 --> 00:32:20,668
Just neighbor helping neighbor.

740
00:32:20,669 --> 00:32:22,302
That's what got

741
00:32:22,303 --> 00:32:24,772
BlueBell back upon
its feet then, after Katrina,

742
00:32:24,773 --> 00:32:26,974
after whatever came to
try and knock her down.

743
00:32:26,975 --> 00:32:28,643
You know what?

744
00:32:28,644 --> 00:32:30,678
Like, the costumes,
the pirate stuff--

745
00:32:30,679 --> 00:32:32,512
that's all just meant
to be fun.

746
00:32:32,513 --> 00:32:34,280
This holiday is really
about community.

747
00:32:36,984 --> 00:32:39,019
Yeah.

748
00:32:41,856 --> 00:32:43,222
- Dad?
- Mm?

749
00:32:43,223 --> 00:32:45,258
Do you play tennis?

750
00:32:45,259 --> 00:32:46,826
- Why do you ask?
- I was thinking

751
00:32:46,827 --> 00:32:48,894
we should join a doubles
tennis league in Montgomery.

752
00:32:48,895 --> 00:32:50,362
I don't know how to play,

753
00:32:50,363 --> 00:32:52,698
but I was hoping that
you could teach me.

754
00:32:52,699 --> 00:32:55,167
Wouldn't that be a kick?

755
00:32:55,168 --> 00:32:58,270
- Hey.
- Oh, there you two are.

756
00:32:58,271 --> 00:33:00,238
We have reservations
for a celebration dinner

757
00:33:00,239 --> 00:33:02,908

I've got a client
who needs help.

What client?
You're working for me now.

761

I'm sorry. Did you not hear
someone needs his help?

Look, Dad, this is
really important, okay?

763
00:33:12,484 --> 00:33:14,351
So y'all are gonna have
to go without us tonight,

764
00:33:14,352 --> 00:33:15,987
and we'll see you back
here in the morning?

- Whoa.

Well, I'm just saying,

819
00:35:17,604 --> 00:35:19,271
in order to be a good
lawyer, you have to learn

820
00:35:19,272 --> 00:35:20,973
how to separate the personal
from the professional,

821
00:35:20,974 --> 00:35:24,243
and, and my son is
occasionally too soft-hearted

822
