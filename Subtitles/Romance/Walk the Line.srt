1
00:00:04,811 --> 00:00:07,109
(drumroll)

2
00:00:07,213 --> 00:00:10,011
(rousing orchestral
fanfare playing)

3
00:00:19,659 --> 00:00:21,627
(fanfare ends)

4
00:00:26,099 --> 00:00:29,364
(muffled rockabilly music
playing in distance)

5
00:00:58,431 --> 00:01:01,400
(muffled music acoustics
vibrate loudly)

6
00:01:03,536 --> 00:01:06,027
(keys jingling)

7
00:01:09,776 --> 00:01:12,574
(music grows louder
and clearer)

8
00:01:12,679 --> 00:01:14,977
(crow caws)

9
00:01:15,081 --> 00:01:19,677
(rockabilly music continues)

10
00:01:19,786 --> 00:01:24,246
(guitar plays
"Walk the Line"intro)

11
00:01:38,972 --> 00:01:41,167
(keys jangling)

12
00:01:46,146 --> 00:01:49,877
(music grows louder)

13
00:01:49,983 --> 00:01:52,884
(men shouting excitedly)

14
00:01:52,986 --> 00:01:56,251
(clapping and stomping
in time with music)

15
00:02:28,888 --> 00:02:32,380
(muffled music playing
in other room)

16
00:02:41,434 --> 00:02:44,426
MAN:
M-Mr. Cash?

17
00:02:44,537 --> 00:02:46,835
M-Mr. Cash?

18
00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:48,908
(guitar twangs slow melody)

19
00:02:49,008 --> 00:02:50,771
Mr. Cash?

20
00:02:50,877 --> 00:02:51,935
MAN:
J. R...

21
00:02:52,045 --> 00:02:54,411
(man humming soulfully)

22
00:02:54,514 --> 00:02:56,505
J.R., turn it off
and get to sleep.!

23
00:02:56,616 --> 00:02:58,345
Change it,J.R.

24
00:02:58,451 --> 00:03:00,009
Turn it off.

25
00:03:00,119 --> 00:03:02,144
(changing radio stations)

26
00:03:02,255 --> 00:03:04,450
(girl singing on radio)

27
00:03:07,327 --> 00:03:08,794
Guess which Carter that is.

28
00:03:10,997 --> 00:03:12,157
Anita?

29
00:03:12,265 --> 00:03:13,698
- MAN: (over radio): That's fine.
- Nope. June.

30
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,631
That was little ten-year-old
June singing for you.

31
00:03:15,735 --> 00:03:17,362
And what was the name
of that number now?

32
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:18,630
(June speaks indistinctly)

33
00:03:18,738 --> 00:03:20,103
MAN (banging on door):
Turn it off!

34
00:03:20,206 --> 00:03:21,969
Do I have to come in there?!

35
00:03:22,075 --> 00:03:24,635
(radio stops playing)

36
00:03:24,744 --> 00:03:26,371
Let's get to bed.

37
00:03:28,481 --> 00:03:31,211
(distant train whistle
blowing)

38
00:03:39,158 --> 00:03:41,626
It's hot.

39
00:03:41,728 --> 00:03:44,219
It's going to be hotter
tomorrow.

40
00:03:44,330 --> 00:03:46,059
Maybe Daddy will
quit us early

41
00:03:46,165 --> 00:03:48,633
and we can
go fishin'.

42
00:03:48,735 --> 00:03:52,193
We'll go fishin'
Saturday.

43
00:03:52,305 --> 00:03:55,172
Daddy needs a good day from us
tomorrow,J.R.

44
00:03:55,275 --> 00:03:57,573
I know.

45
00:04:00,547 --> 00:04:01,445
Jack?

46
00:04:01,548 --> 00:04:02,913
Mm-hmm?

47
00:04:06,052 --> 00:04:07,952
How come you're so good?

48
00:04:09,155 --> 00:04:11,919
I ain't.

49
00:04:13,893 --> 00:04:15,918
You pick five times
more than me.

50
00:04:16,029 --> 00:04:17,656
Well, I'm bigger than you are.

51
00:04:17,764 --> 00:04:21,564
You know every story
in Scripture.

52
00:04:21,668 --> 00:04:24,432
You know every song
in Mama's hymnal.

53
00:04:24,537 --> 00:04:25,663
Songs are easy.

54
00:04:25,772 --> 00:04:26,704
(chuckling)

55
00:04:26,806 --> 00:04:28,569
They ain't for me.

56
00:04:28,675 --> 00:04:32,042
There's more words in the Bible
than in Heavenly Highway Hymns.

57
00:04:32,145 --> 00:04:34,978
Look,J.R., if I'm gonna be
a preacher one day...

58
00:04:35,081 --> 00:04:36,981
I got to know the Bible
front to back.

59
00:04:37,083 --> 00:04:39,449
I mean, you can't help nobody
if you can't tell them

60
00:04:39,552 --> 00:04:41,383
the right story.

61
00:04:48,861 --> 00:04:52,957
Said by noon
it's gonna be 104.

62
00:04:53,066 --> 00:04:54,397
Them radio stations
will say anything

63
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:57,435
to get
them niggers off.

64
00:04:57,537 --> 00:05:01,405
Ray, why don't you letJ.R.
Take the babies in?

65
00:05:01,507 --> 00:05:03,873
I told Roz we'd have a crop
yesterday.

66
00:05:03,977 --> 00:05:06,912
What do I say when he pulls up
here and we're shy?

67
00:05:07,013 --> 00:05:08,310
You ready to unload that piano?

68
00:05:09,916 --> 00:05:12,111
We're not selling Daddy's piano.

69
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,148
And I'm not the one in Bartstown

70
00:05:15,254 --> 00:05:17,654
drinking every
Saturday.

71
00:05:22,528 --> 00:05:28,125
(singing)

72
00:05:35,908 --> 00:05:39,469
(both singing)

73
00:05:46,452 --> 00:05:49,944
(imitating Bugs Bunny):
Eh, what's up, Doc?

74
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:09,198
(both laughing)

75
00:06:11,511 --> 00:06:12,500
Whoa!

76
00:06:16,883 --> 00:06:18,612
(both laughing)

77
00:06:22,055 --> 00:06:24,080
What, what did
that rooster say

78
00:06:24,190 --> 00:06:25,782
when he was all
blown up by the TNT

79
00:06:25,892 --> 00:06:29,384
and picking his feathers
up outside that henhouse?

80
00:06:29,495 --> 00:06:31,656
"F-Fortunately, boy,
I keep my feathers numbered

81
00:06:31,764 --> 00:06:34,028
for just such an emergency."

82
00:06:34,133 --> 00:06:35,464
(laughing)

83
00:06:38,571 --> 00:06:41,972
(saw whining)

84
00:06:42,108 --> 00:06:44,542
(saw whining loudly)

85
00:06:52,518 --> 00:06:54,247
(whistling)

86
00:06:57,290 --> 00:06:59,053
(loud bang)

87
00:07:03,429 --> 00:07:05,329
(machine clanks, shuts down)

88
00:07:09,569 --> 00:07:10,968
I got it, I got it.

89
00:07:16,476 --> 00:07:17,909
Can we go soon?

90
00:07:18,010 --> 00:07:20,945
Mr. Coles gave me a dollar
to cut the whole pile...

91
00:07:21,047 --> 00:07:22,036
and not half.

92
00:07:22,148 --> 00:07:25,015
Go on ahead,J.R.

93
00:07:25,118 --> 00:07:27,484
Catch a fish.

94
00:07:32,692 --> 00:07:37,527
The worm on a hook.

95
00:07:37,630 --> 00:07:40,326
Drop it in a brook.

96
00:07:43,035 --> 00:07:47,529
If things go right...

97
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:49,835
you'll fry some fish tonight.

98
00:08:09,162 --> 00:08:11,960
Where you been?
Where you been?

99
00:08:13,566 --> 00:08:14,794
Throw that pole down.

100
00:08:14,901 --> 00:08:16,334
Get in the car! In the car!

101
00:08:17,670 --> 00:08:20,332
(woman humming soulful tune)

102
00:08:24,043 --> 00:08:26,136
(humming)

103
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:36,552
(weakly):
J.R.

104
00:08:44,430 --> 00:08:47,092
(humming continues)

105
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,191
(gasping)

106
00:08:51,904 --> 00:08:53,804
You hear them,J.R.?

107
00:08:53,906 --> 00:08:56,966
You hear them angels?

108
00:08:57,076 --> 00:08:59,670
I can hear 'em, Jack.

109
00:08:59,779 --> 00:09:02,339
They're so beautiful.

110
00:09:02,448 --> 00:09:04,916
Beautiful.

111
00:09:05,017 --> 00:09:07,212
Jack?

112
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:09,015
Do something!

113
00:09:10,957 --> 00:09:12,549
Do something!

114
00:09:19,498 --> 00:09:21,398
(woman singing on radio)

115
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:23,968
(glass breaking,
screen door slams)

116
00:09:24,070 --> 00:09:25,662
(radio playing)

117
00:09:35,648 --> 00:09:37,843
(banging and crashing)

118
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:42,947
(radio continues playing)

119
00:09:46,125 --> 00:09:48,184
You know what that is,J.R.?

120
00:09:48,294 --> 00:09:49,955
You know that is
coming out of there?

121
00:09:50,062 --> 00:09:50,960
Stop it, Ray.

122
00:09:51,063 --> 00:09:52,030
Nothing!

123
00:10:01,774 --> 00:10:06,040
Nothing, that's what that is.

124
00:10:06,145 --> 00:10:07,612
That's what that's worth.

125
00:10:07,713 --> 00:10:09,578
And that's what you are.

126
00:10:09,682 --> 00:10:11,240
CARRI E:
Leave it alone, Ray.

127
00:10:11,350 --> 00:10:12,374
He didn't do this.

128
00:10:12,485 --> 00:10:13,816
RAY:
The devil did this!

129
00:10:13,919 --> 00:10:15,682
He took the wrong son!

130
00:10:15,788 --> 00:10:17,779
- (girls crying)
- Stop it, Ray.

131
00:10:17,890 --> 00:10:19,448
RAY: He was my best,
and now he's gone!

132
00:10:19,558 --> 00:10:21,958
Jack, please,
don't leave me alone.

133
00:10:22,061 --> 00:10:24,495
- CARRI E: Ray!
- RAY: Quiet! Quiet!

134
00:10:24,597 --> 00:10:26,030
Everybody quiet!

135
00:10:26,165 --> 00:10:28,599
(railroad crossing bell
ringing)

136
00:10:28,701 --> 00:10:30,498
(train whistle blowing)

137
00:10:30,603 --> 00:10:32,400
(knocking on door)

138
00:10:36,542 --> 00:10:38,237
You're going to miss your bus.

139
00:10:42,815 --> 00:10:45,716
MAN (over radio): Communist troops
have been driven out of Seoul, Korea...

140
00:10:45,818 --> 00:10:47,683
by U.S. Forces led
by General Douglas MacArthur.

141
00:10:47,787 --> 00:10:50,153
(turns off radio)

142
00:10:50,256 --> 00:10:51,348
Oh. (laughs)

143
00:10:51,457 --> 00:10:53,652
What's that?

144
00:10:53,759 --> 00:10:57,957
Anybody seen Tommy?

145
00:10:58,064 --> 00:10:59,554
He's leaving, Ray. Come on.

146
00:11:01,567 --> 00:11:04,092
JOHNNY:
Don't start crying, Mama.

147
00:11:04,203 --> 00:11:06,728
Be careful
with that rifle,J.R.

148
00:11:06,839 --> 00:11:08,864
Yeah, I will, Mama.

149
00:11:08,975 --> 00:11:11,910
Last month, that Pervis boy
got confused and shot himself.

150
00:11:12,011 --> 00:11:14,741
RAY:
Ain't going to be no battles, Carrie.

151
00:11:14,847 --> 00:11:16,144
He's going to Germany.

152
00:11:16,248 --> 00:11:17,442
The war is in Korea.

153
00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:19,177
I love you.

154
00:11:19,285 --> 00:11:20,616
I love you, too.

155
00:11:21,387 --> 00:11:22,445
Take this.

156
00:11:27,159 --> 00:11:28,956
Thanks, Mama.

157
00:11:30,262 --> 00:11:32,196
Take care of yourself,
Donzil.

158
00:11:32,298 --> 00:11:33,322
Take care
of my sister, too.

159
00:11:33,432 --> 00:11:34,421
I will.

160
00:11:34,533 --> 00:11:37,764
Hey, Tommy, be a good boy.

161
00:11:43,142 --> 00:11:44,404
You're gonna miss your bus.

162
00:11:44,510 --> 00:11:45,909
Yeah.

163
00:12:15,908 --> 00:12:17,876
(birds chirping)

164
00:12:29,088 --> 00:12:31,056
(indistinct conversations)

165
00:12:57,883 --> 00:13:01,114
JOHNNY (whispering):
I saw this church in Dusseldorf...

166
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:04,280
made of limestone,
big as a train station.

167
00:13:04,390 --> 00:13:06,255
We could get married there
and go to Venice.

168
00:13:06,358 --> 00:13:08,155
That's in Italy, Viv.

169
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:11,718
The streets are made
of water, I ain't kiddin'.

170
00:13:11,831 --> 00:13:16,768
VIVIAN:
Johnny, I haven't seen you for two years.

171
00:13:16,869 --> 00:13:20,361
We only dated for a month.

172
00:13:20,473 --> 00:13:24,034
My daddy says there's
something wrong with you.

173
00:13:24,143 --> 00:13:27,306
Well... what do you say, Viv?

174
00:13:27,413 --> 00:13:31,747
I mean...
I thought you said you loved me.

175
00:13:31,851 --> 00:13:33,546
I do.

176
00:13:33,652 --> 00:13:36,120
Oh, I do.

177
00:13:36,222 --> 00:13:37,484
Then don't be scared.

178
00:13:37,590 --> 00:13:38,818
You tell him that.

179
00:13:38,924 --> 00:13:40,357
You tell him I love you, too.

180
00:13:40,459 --> 00:13:42,552
He says that's impossible.

181
00:13:42,661 --> 00:13:44,629
He says that you hardly know me.

182
00:13:44,730 --> 00:13:46,561
Well, I know perfect
when I meet it.

183
00:13:46,665 --> 00:13:48,326
MAN:
Let's go, Cash!

184
00:13:48,434 --> 00:13:50,459
(clears throat)

185
00:13:50,569 --> 00:13:51,900
Viv, listen, baby...

186
00:13:52,004 --> 00:13:53,767
you tell your daddy
I'm your man.

187
00:13:53,873 --> 00:13:55,306
Tell him we're
gonna make a family

188
00:13:55,407 --> 00:13:57,432
and I'm gonna be on the radio,
'cause I am.

189
00:13:57,543 --> 00:13:59,340
You tell him we're
gonna have a nice house

190
00:13:59,445 --> 00:14:00,537
and we're gonna be happy.

191
00:14:00,646 --> 00:14:01,874
And we're gonna live in Memphis.

192
00:14:01,981 --> 00:14:03,642
And you tell him I'm
gonna love you forever.

193
00:14:03,749 --> 00:14:05,011
- Do you promise?
- That's a promise, Viv.

194
00:14:05,117 --> 00:14:06,015
Do you hear me?

195
00:14:06,118 --> 00:14:07,210
That's a pro...

196
00:14:07,319 --> 00:14:10,846
Five minutes was up
five minutes ago.

197
00:14:16,829 --> 00:14:20,458
NARRATOR:
I am Folsom Prison.

198
00:14:20,566 --> 00:14:24,502
At one time they called me
"Bloody Folsom."

199
00:14:24,603 --> 00:14:25,831
And I earned the name.

200
00:14:25,938 --> 00:14:26,996
My own prisoners built me.

201
00:14:27,106 --> 00:14:29,734
Every block of my granite

202
00:14:29,842 --> 00:14:31,810
is cemented by
the blood of many men.

203
00:14:31,911 --> 00:14:34,038
Is it any wonder a man
sometimes went berserk

204
00:14:34,146 --> 00:14:37,638
and fought the hated walls
that shut him in?

205
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:38,648
GUARD:
Knock it off!

206
00:14:38,751 --> 00:14:40,742
You knock it off
and get to sleep!

207
00:14:40,853 --> 00:14:43,617
NARRATOR:
This was a common thing in those old days.

208
00:14:43,722 --> 00:14:46,623
(fades into background):
I had so little work for them to do...

209
00:14:46,725 --> 00:14:47,851
(guitar playing)

210
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:51,123
(singing)

211
00:14:58,771 --> 00:15:01,331
(mutters)

212
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:02,964
(singing)

213
00:15:03,075 --> 00:15:06,067
(muttering)

214
00:15:06,178 --> 00:15:08,942
(speaking quietly)

215
00:15:09,048 --> 00:15:13,849
(singing)

216
00:15:47,753 --> 00:15:50,085
(footsteps)

217
00:15:55,894 --> 00:15:58,761
(song ends)

218
00:16:06,205 --> 00:16:10,869
(baby fussing)

219
00:16:17,282 --> 00:16:24,950
(man singing on radio)

220
00:16:29,895 --> 00:16:31,920
You gonna try
today, John?

221
00:16:32,031 --> 00:16:34,499
Really try to sell something?

222
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:35,589
What does that mean?

223
00:16:35,701 --> 00:16:36,827
I cleaned out

224
00:16:36,935 --> 00:16:40,166
your case last night,
and, baby, all I found

225
00:16:40,272 --> 00:16:42,672
were peanut bags
and music magazines.

226
00:16:42,775 --> 00:16:45,266
I need you
to think about

227
00:16:45,377 --> 00:16:47,174
what my daddy offered.

228
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:50,476
(radio continues)

229
00:16:50,582 --> 00:16:52,311
Viv, I'm trying.

230
00:16:52,418 --> 00:16:56,684
I mean, I'm really
trying to sell stuff.

231
00:17:05,464 --> 00:17:07,364
(ends)

232
00:17:07,466 --> 00:17:08,899
(doorbell rings)

233
00:17:09,001 --> 00:17:10,025
Hello, ma'am.

234
00:17:10,135 --> 00:17:11,432
I'm from Home Equipment Company

235
00:17:11,537 --> 00:17:14,335
over on Summer,
and we have a lot of...

236
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:16,772
...enamel colors
that you can choose from

237
00:17:16,875 --> 00:17:19,002
that we can...

238
00:17:19,111 --> 00:17:20,669
Hello. I'm John Cash

239
00:17:20,779 --> 00:17:23,339
and I'm from the Home Equipment
Company on Summer.

240
00:17:23,449 --> 00:17:25,576
WOMAN:
LaQuisha!

241
00:17:25,684 --> 00:17:28,517
LaQuisha, who is it!?

242
00:18:08,394 --> 00:18:10,919
You are late, man.

243
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:17,498
(bottles rattling)

244
00:18:31,150 --> 00:18:34,881
(band tuning up)

245
00:18:34,987 --> 00:18:36,921
(man singing blues faintly)

246
00:18:43,162 --> 00:18:50,000
(singing)

247
00:18:59,611 --> 00:19:02,580
(singing continues)

248
00:19:33,045 --> 00:19:35,206
(music continues)

249
00:19:47,292 --> 00:19:48,520
(tuning instruments)

250
00:19:48,627 --> 00:19:51,619
Little higher.

251
00:19:51,730 --> 00:19:54,563
A little...
yeah, a little higher.

252
00:19:54,666 --> 00:19:55,997
Now play the chord.

253
00:20:01,874 --> 00:20:04,035
Let's hear your E, Marshal.

254
00:20:05,844 --> 00:20:07,368
There's my E.

255
00:20:07,479 --> 00:20:10,175
WOMAN:
Lulubelle, time to come in!

256
00:20:10,282 --> 00:20:14,742
Jack! Jack, get in here!

257
00:20:14,853 --> 00:20:16,548
- Let's go.
- Jack!

258
00:20:16,655 --> 00:20:18,282
Let's go, John.

259
00:20:24,196 --> 00:20:27,893
(singing)

260
00:20:38,610 --> 00:20:43,843
(singing continues)

261
00:20:57,796 --> 00:21:00,128
(singing)

262
00:21:15,380 --> 00:21:17,143
(Vivian sobbing)

263
00:21:19,585 --> 00:21:21,177
(song ends)

264
00:21:21,286 --> 00:21:22,310
Viv?

265
00:21:29,595 --> 00:21:32,120
- (knocking)
- Viv, open the door.

266
00:21:32,230 --> 00:21:33,822
(whispers):
Viv.

267
00:21:33,932 --> 00:21:37,299
(turns on radio, woman singing)

268
00:21:37,402 --> 00:21:39,495
Viv, don't embarrass me.

269
00:21:39,605 --> 00:21:42,369
You know who's out there
watching.

270
00:21:47,779 --> 00:21:50,441
I want to see my daddy.

271
00:21:50,549 --> 00:21:52,847
I want to go
home, John.

272
00:21:52,951 --> 00:21:54,612
Please.

273
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:57,154
He's just got a job,
sitting in there in San Anton...

274
00:21:57,255 --> 00:21:58,847
just waiting for us.
It's just sitting there...

275
00:21:58,957 --> 00:21:59,946
it's just sitting there
waiting...

276
00:22:00,058 --> 00:22:01,150
Viv, the guys are here.

277
00:22:01,259 --> 00:22:03,250
My band is here in Memphis.

278
00:22:03,362 --> 00:22:06,024
Your band?

279
00:22:06,131 --> 00:22:07,359
John, your band?

280
00:22:07,466 --> 00:22:12,096
Your band is two mechanics
who can't hardly play.

281
00:22:12,204 --> 00:22:16,504
Baby, can't you hear the
difference between you and that?

282
00:22:16,608 --> 00:22:17,802
You have your wife

283
00:22:17,909 --> 00:22:21,208
and your baby in a dump, John...

284
00:22:21,313 --> 00:22:22,940
and another one on the way...

285
00:22:23,048 --> 00:22:27,747
and we can't even
make rent, John.

286
00:22:37,596 --> 00:22:40,292
(rhythm and blues playing)

287
00:22:40,399 --> 00:22:42,890
(music stops)

288
00:22:51,276 --> 00:22:52,766
Excuse me, sir.

289
00:22:52,878 --> 00:22:54,345
Are you the owner
of this place?

290
00:22:54,446 --> 00:22:55,606
That's me.

291
00:22:55,714 --> 00:22:57,477
Hello, I'm J.R. Cash.

292
00:22:57,582 --> 00:22:58,708
Sam Phillips.

293
00:22:58,817 --> 00:23:00,148
Well, good to meet
you, Mr. Phillips.

294
00:23:00,252 --> 00:23:01,844
I'm a singer
and I've got a band...

295
00:23:01,953 --> 00:23:03,420
and we've been
working on some songs.

296
00:23:03,522 --> 00:23:05,513
You want to cut a record, son?
It's four dollars.

297
00:23:05,624 --> 00:23:09,025
What about the guys there
on the wall in the pictures?

298
00:23:09,127 --> 00:23:10,788
I mean, they pay four dollars?

299
00:23:10,896 --> 00:23:12,124
They're on my label.

300
00:23:12,230 --> 00:23:14,198
How do I get
on there?

301
00:23:14,299 --> 00:23:15,391
You audition.

302
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:18,492
Right now?

303
00:23:18,603 --> 00:23:20,969
Call my secretary, Marion,
when she comes back.

304
00:23:21,073 --> 00:23:22,165
She's at the salon.

305
00:23:22,274 --> 00:23:23,798
She'll set you up
an appointment next month.

306
00:23:23,909 --> 00:23:25,240
I can't wait that long,
Mr. Phillips.

307
00:23:25,343 --> 00:23:27,470
Excuse me?

308
00:23:27,579 --> 00:23:30,412
I can't wait that long.

309
00:23:33,018 --> 00:23:34,508
What about this one?

310
00:23:34,619 --> 00:23:36,917
I can iron it.

311
00:23:37,022 --> 00:23:38,649
John, you can't
wear that one.

312
00:23:38,757 --> 00:23:39,985
It's black.

313
00:23:40,092 --> 00:23:41,753
It's the only color shirt
we all have.

314
00:23:41,860 --> 00:23:43,191
Nothing wrong with black.

315
00:23:43,295 --> 00:23:45,126
It looks like you're
going to a funeral.

316
00:23:45,230 --> 00:23:46,998
Maybe I am.

317
00:23:46,998 --> 00:23:47,521
Maybe I am.

318
00:23:47,632 --> 00:23:48,500
(Johnny singing)

319
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:50,058
(Johnny singing)

320
00:23:50,168 --> 00:23:51,692
(men singing)

321
00:23:51,803 --> 00:23:54,271
(singing continues)

322
00:24:11,656 --> 00:24:12,623
Hold on.

323
00:24:12,724 --> 00:24:13,713
Hold on.

324
00:24:13,825 --> 00:24:15,417
I hate to interrupt...

325
00:24:15,527 --> 00:24:17,757
but do you guys
got something else?

326
00:24:21,666 --> 00:24:22,724
I'm sorry.

327
00:24:22,834 --> 00:24:24,392
I can't market gospel.

328
00:24:24,503 --> 00:24:25,765
No more.

329
00:24:28,173 --> 00:24:29,640
So that's it?

330
00:24:31,610 --> 00:24:35,376
I don't record material
that doesn't sell, Mr. Cash...

331
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:38,040
and gospel like that
doesn't sell.

332
00:24:38,150 --> 00:24:41,381
Was it the gospel
or the way I sing it?

333
00:24:41,486 --> 00:24:42,885
Both.

334
00:24:42,988 --> 00:24:45,548
Well, what's wrong with
the way I sing it?

335
00:24:45,657 --> 00:24:48,057
I don't believe you.

336
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:51,220
You saying
I don't believe in God?

337
00:24:51,329 --> 00:24:53,593
J.R., come on,
let's go.

338
00:24:53,698 --> 00:24:55,563
No.
I want to understand.

339
00:24:55,667 --> 00:24:58,067
I mean, we come down here,
we play for a minute...

340
00:24:58,170 --> 00:24:59,603
and he tells me
I don't believe in God.

341
00:24:59,704 --> 00:25:01,604
You know exactly
what I'm telling you.

342
00:25:01,706 --> 00:25:06,643
We've already heard that song
a hundred times...

343
00:25:06,745 --> 00:25:10,408
just like that,
just like how you sang it.

344
00:25:10,515 --> 00:25:12,779
Well, you didn't let us
bring it home.

345
00:25:12,884 --> 00:25:17,014
Bring... bring it home?

346
00:25:17,122 --> 00:25:19,283
All right, let's bring it home.

347
00:25:19,391 --> 00:25:21,518
If you was hit by a truck

348
00:25:21,626 --> 00:25:23,423
and you were lying out
in that gutter dying...

349
00:25:23,528 --> 00:25:27,794
and you had time to sing
one song, huh, one song...

350
00:25:27,899 --> 00:25:30,299
people would remember
before you're dirt...

351
00:25:30,402 --> 00:25:31,994
one song that would let

352
00:25:32,103 --> 00:25:36,540
God know what you felt about
your time here on earth...

353
00:25:36,641 --> 00:25:38,905
one song that would sum you up...

354
00:25:39,010 --> 00:25:41,308
you telling me
that's the song you'd sing?

355
00:25:41,413 --> 00:25:46,112
That sameJimmie Davis tune
we hear on the radio all day?

356
00:25:46,218 --> 00:25:49,676
About your peace within
and how it's real

357
00:25:49,788 --> 00:25:52,222
and how you're
gonna shout it?

358
00:25:52,324 --> 00:25:55,384
Or would you sing
something different?

359
00:25:55,493 --> 00:25:58,121
Something real,
something you felt?

360
00:25:58,230 --> 00:25:59,720
Because I'm telling you
right now...

361
00:25:59,831 --> 00:26:01,799
that's the kind of song
people want to hear.

362
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:06,735
That's the kind of song
that truly saves people.

363
00:26:06,838 --> 00:26:10,501
It ain't got nothing to do with
believing in God, Mr. Cash.

364
00:26:10,609 --> 00:26:13,237
It has to do with
believing in yourself.

365
00:26:19,017 --> 00:26:24,250
Well, I've got a couple songs
I wrote in the Air Force.

366
00:26:24,356 --> 00:26:27,086
You got anything against
the Air Force?

367
00:26:27,192 --> 00:26:29,422
No.

368
00:26:29,527 --> 00:26:33,258
I do.

369
00:26:35,834 --> 00:26:37,734
J.R., whatever
you're about to play...

370
00:26:37,836 --> 00:26:39,201
we ain't never heard it.

371
00:26:39,304 --> 00:26:42,535
(guitar strumming)

372
00:26:42,641 --> 00:26:46,771
(singing)

373
00:27:02,994 --> 00:27:09,524
(singing continues)

374
00:27:09,634 --> 00:27:14,230
(guitar strumming)

375
00:27:50,742 --> 00:27:53,302
(instruments playing)

376
00:28:33,585 --> 00:28:36,748
(electric guitar plays melody)

377
00:28:46,798 --> 00:28:50,165
(band continues playing)

378
00:28:50,268 --> 00:28:51,302
(thunder rumbling)

379
00:28:51,302 --> 00:28:53,099
(thunder rumbling)

380
00:28:53,204 --> 00:28:56,571
(rain falling)

381
00:28:56,674 --> 00:28:59,199
(door opening)

382
00:29:03,248 --> 00:29:04,772
Where you been?

383
00:29:06,418 --> 00:29:08,477
Are you drunk?

384
00:29:10,021 --> 00:29:11,955
(sighs)

385
00:29:12,057 --> 00:29:13,319
What happened?

386
00:29:13,425 --> 00:29:16,189
He didn't like our gospel.

387
00:29:17,429 --> 00:29:20,398
So I played him some
songs that I wrote.

388
00:29:20,498 --> 00:29:23,661
We made a record, Viv.

389
00:29:23,768 --> 00:29:26,202
I mean, a real,
real record.

390
00:29:30,041 --> 00:29:33,033
We did it like,
like six times.

391
00:29:33,144 --> 00:29:35,135
I had to sing the song
over and over again.

392
00:29:35,246 --> 00:29:36,713
And, uh, and playin' it.

393
00:29:36,815 --> 00:29:38,043
And you should have
seen Marshall.

394
00:29:38,149 --> 00:29:39,081
He was so nervous.

395
00:29:39,184 --> 00:29:41,243
But I mean, we made
a real record

396
00:29:41,352 --> 00:29:42,420
- of my song.
- Oh, baby.

397
00:29:42,420 --> 00:29:42,852
- Of my song.
- Oh, baby.

398
00:29:42,954 --> 00:29:45,422
(piano plays
"Lewis Boogie")

399
00:29:48,593 --> 00:29:51,323
(singing)

400
00:30:05,877 --> 00:30:07,435
(playing piano)

401
00:30:10,982 --> 00:30:13,815
Never seen nobody
play like that.

402
00:30:13,918 --> 00:30:17,115
(piano playing)

403
00:30:21,125 --> 00:30:25,357
(singing continues)

404
00:30:42,514 --> 00:30:44,379
(cheering)

405
00:30:44,482 --> 00:30:46,575
ANNOUNCER:
Ladies and gentlemen...

406
00:30:46,684 --> 00:30:49,380
The KillerJerry Lee Lewis!

407
00:30:49,487 --> 00:30:50,681
(applause, cheering)

408
00:30:50,788 --> 00:30:52,949
Get yourselves
a pine box, boys...

409
00:30:53,057 --> 00:30:55,525
nobody follows The Killer.

410
00:30:55,627 --> 00:30:57,322
ANNOUNCER:
These next boys have just put out

411
00:30:57,428 --> 00:31:00,022
their first record
called "Cry, Cry, Cry"

412
00:31:00,131 --> 00:31:02,463
- and it is selling like hotcakes.
- Shoot, now I'm late.

413
00:31:02,567 --> 00:31:03,966
Oh, my gosh!

414
00:31:04,068 --> 00:31:05,660
Excuse me.
That's my cue.

415
00:31:05,770 --> 00:31:07,533
Oh, no, you...
oh, that's stuck...

416
00:31:07,639 --> 00:31:08,697
right on my dress.

417
00:31:08,806 --> 00:31:10,137
Hey, Bill!

418
00:31:10,241 --> 00:31:11,799
- Let me get...
- Hold on, Bill... I'm comin'!

419
00:31:11,910 --> 00:31:13,969
- (audience laughs)
- Uh... Oh, my.

420
00:31:14,078 --> 00:31:16,979
I think I hearJune Carter's
voice, ladies and gentlemen.

421
00:31:17,081 --> 00:31:19,049
(applause)

422
00:31:19,150 --> 00:31:21,983
I'll be right there, Bill,
I'll be right there.

423
00:31:22,086 --> 00:31:24,213
- (audience laughs)
- Uh, reckon when, June?

424
00:31:24,322 --> 00:31:27,655
Well, Bill,
I got tangled.

425
00:31:27,759 --> 00:31:29,693
- (audience laughs)
- Yeah, in what, June Bug?

426
00:31:29,794 --> 00:31:32,228
Johnny Cash's
guitar strap.

427
00:31:32,330 --> 00:31:33,297
(laughing)

428
00:31:33,398 --> 00:31:35,127
Don't worry,
I can keep this funny

429
00:31:35,233 --> 00:31:36,200
for at least two minutes.

430
00:31:36,301 --> 00:31:38,292
And I tell you what, Bill.

431
00:31:38,403 --> 00:31:40,496
He's a strapping boy,
thatJohnny Cash.

432
00:31:40,605 --> 00:31:43,870
And his guitar strap is
pretty strappin', too.

433
00:31:43,975 --> 00:31:45,442
(audience laughing)

434
00:31:45,543 --> 00:31:47,306
Here. I love that
Cry song by the way.

435
00:31:47,412 --> 00:31:49,972
Thanks.

436
00:31:50,081 --> 00:31:51,309
Ladies and gentlemen,
Miss June Carter.

437
00:31:51,416 --> 00:31:52,815
- (applause)
- Bill!

438
00:31:52,917 --> 00:31:54,748
Bill, I had to come
and tell you.

439
00:31:54,852 --> 00:31:56,444
I had to tell you...

440
00:31:56,554 --> 00:31:58,454
I had to tell you

441
00:31:58,556 --> 00:31:59,716
I just can't
sing tonight.

442
00:31:59,824 --> 00:32:01,758
(audience groans)

443
00:32:01,859 --> 00:32:04,089
You best be getting out here.

444
00:32:04,195 --> 00:32:06,288
Well, Bill...

445
00:32:06,397 --> 00:32:08,126
I got the laryngitis.

446
00:32:08,232 --> 00:32:09,995
(laughing)

447
00:32:10,101 --> 00:32:11,227
- June, we...
- I do!

448
00:32:11,336 --> 00:32:12,769
Y'all laughing,
but I do.

449
00:32:12,870 --> 00:32:14,064
(laughing)

450
00:32:14,172 --> 00:32:17,938
We all just heard you
hollering up a storm backstage.

451
00:32:18,042 --> 00:32:21,034
Well, I didn't have it then,
Bill.

452
00:32:21,145 --> 00:32:22,806
(audience laughing)

453
00:32:22,914 --> 00:32:23,938
(applause)

454
00:32:24,048 --> 00:32:25,379
Ladies and gentlemen,
Miss June Carter.

455
00:32:25,483 --> 00:32:29,317
(applause)

456
00:32:33,424 --> 00:32:34,823
(clears throat):
All right.

457
00:32:34,926 --> 00:32:36,450
June's going to be back
to sing later.

458
00:32:36,561 --> 00:32:38,426
Her family is also
with us tonight.

459
00:32:38,529 --> 00:32:41,293
But like I was saying,
these boys up next

460
00:32:41,399 --> 00:32:42,696
are hotter than a pistol.

461
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:44,267
They are burning up the radio

462
00:32:44,369 --> 00:32:45,700
with their new hit,
"Cry, Cry, Cry."

463
00:32:45,803 --> 00:32:47,236
We want to make sure we

464
00:32:47,338 --> 00:32:49,499
give them
a big Texarkana welcome.

465
00:32:49,607 --> 00:32:50,699
So here they are, folks.

466
00:32:50,808 --> 00:32:53,276
New passengers on
the Sun Rocking Railway-

467
00:32:53,378 --> 00:32:55,744
Johnny Cash
and the Tennessee Two.

468
00:32:55,847 --> 00:32:58,611
(applause)

469
00:33:08,226 --> 00:33:10,387
Hello.

470
00:33:10,495 --> 00:33:12,963
I'm Johnny Cash.

471
00:33:13,064 --> 00:33:17,899
(applause)

472
00:33:18,936 --> 00:33:21,530
(playing guitar)

473
00:33:21,639 --> 00:33:23,607
(singing)

474
00:33:23,708 --> 00:33:25,266
(bandjoins in)

475
00:33:31,549 --> 00:33:34,177
(singing continues)

476
00:34:17,495 --> 00:34:20,396
(playing solo)

477
00:34:36,681 --> 00:34:38,979
(singing resumes)

478
00:35:07,812 --> 00:35:12,772
(song ends)

479
00:35:12,884 --> 00:35:17,150
(cheering)

480
00:35:19,223 --> 00:35:22,715
Thank you, thank you very much.

481
00:35:22,827 --> 00:35:24,590
(singing)

482
00:35:30,735 --> 00:35:31,895
Viv, I'm telling you...

483
00:35:32,003 --> 00:35:33,971
I think this is the best show
we've ever done.

484
00:35:34,071 --> 00:35:36,039
Hell, it might be the best show
I've ever seen.

485
00:35:36,140 --> 00:35:37,402
No kidding!

486
00:35:37,508 --> 00:35:38,532
Where are you?

487
00:35:38,643 --> 00:35:39,632
Texarkana.

488
00:35:39,744 --> 00:35:41,336
Baby, I miss you.

489
00:35:41,445 --> 00:35:43,037
Hey, do you hear Orbison
doing our song?

490
00:35:43,147 --> 00:35:44,512
He turned it into
a two-step, listen.

491
00:35:44,615 --> 00:35:45,775
(singing continues)

492
00:35:45,883 --> 00:35:47,646
You hear that?

493
00:35:47,752 --> 00:35:48,719
Oh, damn it!

494
00:35:48,820 --> 00:35:50,617
- (child crying)
- What's the matter?

495
00:35:50,721 --> 00:35:52,621
Damn it!
Oh, it's Roseanne.

496
00:35:52,723 --> 00:35:54,247
She just ran her head
into the table.

497
00:35:54,358 --> 00:35:55,347
Roseanne!

498
00:35:55,460 --> 00:35:57,553
Roseanne, here, talk to Daddy.

499
00:35:57,662 --> 00:35:59,220
Hey, Roseanne.
Hey, it's Daddy.

500
00:35:59,330 --> 00:36:00,695
(Roseanne crying)

501
00:36:00,798 --> 00:36:02,425
Honey, don't, don't cry.

502
00:36:02,533 --> 00:36:04,296
Daddy's going to be home
real soon.

503
00:36:04,402 --> 00:36:05,892
- VIVIAN: John, I have to go.
- Huh?

504
00:36:06,003 --> 00:36:07,470
I have to go, John.

505
00:36:07,572 --> 00:36:09,130
(audience cheering)

506
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:11,265
Bye.

507
00:36:11,375 --> 00:36:14,105
(singing)

508
00:36:26,624 --> 00:36:28,683
(guitar, fiddle solos)

509
00:36:36,167 --> 00:36:37,794
(singing resumes)

510
00:36:37,902 --> 00:36:40,166
You're sounding
good tonight, Cash.

511
00:36:40,271 --> 00:36:41,636
Real tight.

512
00:36:41,739 --> 00:36:44,071
Oh, thanks, man.

513
00:36:44,175 --> 00:36:46,735
You want some chili fries?

514
00:36:46,844 --> 00:36:49,142
Oh, no, that's all right.

515
00:36:49,247 --> 00:36:50,908
She's been in the spotlight

516
00:36:51,015 --> 00:36:53,882
since you and me
was bitin' ankles.

517
00:36:53,985 --> 00:36:55,816
They say Maybelle
had a crib at the Ryman...

518
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:58,787
so she could pull her out
and let her whoop and holler

519
00:36:58,890 --> 00:37:00,858
and pop her back in
to go to sleep.

520
00:37:03,127 --> 00:37:06,358
(audience cheering)

521
00:37:14,672 --> 00:37:15,661
(song ends)

522
00:37:15,773 --> 00:37:19,300
(horn honks)

523
00:37:19,410 --> 00:37:21,037
We're leaving
in an hour, John.

524
00:37:21,145 --> 00:37:22,669
All right.

525
00:37:24,782 --> 00:37:27,615
J UNE:
Aw, that's a sweet story, honey.

526
00:37:30,621 --> 00:37:32,885
No.

527
00:37:32,990 --> 00:37:35,083
Within, like, five minutes.

528
00:37:35,192 --> 00:37:37,490
All right.

529
00:37:37,595 --> 00:37:39,256
Everything else
all right?

530
00:37:39,363 --> 00:37:40,728
Okay.

531
00:37:40,831 --> 00:37:42,230
I love you, too.

532
00:37:44,302 --> 00:37:45,633
Bye-bye.

533
00:37:45,736 --> 00:37:46,760
How you doing?

534
00:37:46,871 --> 00:37:47,803
Bye.

535
00:37:47,905 --> 00:37:49,304
Coffee?

536
00:37:49,407 --> 00:37:52,501
JOHNNY:
Yeah, and some toast, please.

537
00:37:54,579 --> 00:37:56,206
Hey.

538
00:37:56,314 --> 00:37:58,441
- Hey, how are you?
- Good. Do you mind?

539
00:37:58,549 --> 00:37:59,982
(in husky voice):
No, not at all.

540
00:38:00,084 --> 00:38:01,016
Did you lose your voice?

541
00:38:01,118 --> 00:38:02,210
I did.

542
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:04,880
I was just singing my
heart out up there.

543
00:38:04,989 --> 00:38:08,891
I've got to ask you how
you came up with that sound.

544
00:38:08,993 --> 00:38:10,756
What sound?

545
00:38:10,861 --> 00:38:11,885
That sound everybody's
talking about.

546
00:38:11,996 --> 00:38:14,464
Steady like a train,
sharp like a razor.

547
00:38:14,565 --> 00:38:18,558
Well, we'd play
faster if we could.

548
00:38:18,669 --> 00:38:19,829
I guess it just...

549
00:38:19,937 --> 00:38:23,134
come out like that.

550
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:24,798
WAITRESS:
I got to close my register.

551
00:38:24,909 --> 00:38:26,399
Oh, yeah, sure.

552
00:38:27,912 --> 00:38:31,609
Thank you.

553
00:38:31,716 --> 00:38:32,842
Here's a picture

554
00:38:32,950 --> 00:38:34,679
of my wife, Viv...

555
00:38:34,785 --> 00:38:37,083
- my baby, Roseanne.
- Oh, look at her.

556
00:38:37,188 --> 00:38:39,349
She's beautiful.

557
00:38:39,457 --> 00:38:41,584
Thanks. Got another one
on the way.

558
00:38:41,692 --> 00:38:43,023
- I got a little girl, too.
- Yeah?

559
00:38:43,127 --> 00:38:44,958
Her name's Carlene, yeah.
She's about the same age.

560
00:38:49,100 --> 00:38:50,931
You know when I was
in the service...

561
00:38:51,035 --> 00:38:52,730
I used to look at
pictures of you...

562
00:38:52,837 --> 00:38:53,861
you know, in magazines.

563
00:38:53,971 --> 00:38:55,996
Oh.

564
00:38:56,107 --> 00:38:59,838
No... no, it
wasn't like that.

565
00:38:59,944 --> 00:39:02,412
I mean, I... I liked
your music, you know?

566
00:39:02,513 --> 00:39:03,480
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

567
00:39:03,581 --> 00:39:06,311
I mean, I... you were,
well, you are...

568
00:39:06,417 --> 00:39:08,146
I mean, l-I kept
track of you.

569
00:39:08,252 --> 00:39:10,914
You and
your family.

570
00:39:11,022 --> 00:39:13,388
I listened to your voice
my whole life, you know?

571
00:39:13,491 --> 00:39:16,187
Me and my brother, Jack...

572
00:39:16,293 --> 00:39:18,659
we always listened
to your songs.

573
00:39:18,763 --> 00:39:20,094
Like "Swallerin' Place."

574
00:39:20,197 --> 00:39:21,459
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

575
00:39:21,565 --> 00:39:24,466
We liked it when
you'd sing one alone.

576
00:39:24,568 --> 00:39:27,503
Well, you and Jack
are the only ones.

577
00:39:27,605 --> 00:39:29,004
What do you mean?

578
00:39:29,106 --> 00:39:32,166
I'm not really much
of a singer, Johnny.

579
00:39:32,276 --> 00:39:36,076
I mean, I got a lot
of personality, I got sass...

580
00:39:36,180 --> 00:39:38,671
I give it my all,
but my sister Anita's

581
00:39:38,783 --> 00:39:40,341
really the one
who's got the pipes.

582
00:39:40,451 --> 00:39:41,475
Well, who said that?

583
00:39:41,585 --> 00:39:43,177
Everybody.
My mama, my daddy.

584
00:39:43,287 --> 00:39:46,279
That's how come I learned
to be funny...

585
00:39:46,390 --> 00:39:48,551
so I'd have something
to offer.

586
00:39:50,628 --> 00:39:53,563
Well... parents
aren't always

587
00:39:53,664 --> 00:39:54,756
the best judge
of things...

588
00:39:54,865 --> 00:39:57,595
if you want
my opinion.

589
00:40:01,205 --> 00:40:03,696
So how long you on the tour?

590
00:40:03,808 --> 00:40:05,605
Another couple
of weeks.

591
00:40:05,710 --> 00:40:07,644
We just got
on board, but...

592
00:40:07,745 --> 00:40:10,305
I tell you it feels
like a lot longer.

593
00:40:10,414 --> 00:40:12,109
I'm sure.

594
00:40:12,216 --> 00:40:14,013
I'm headed off,
I'm going to the Ryman.

595
00:40:14,118 --> 00:40:16,143
Why don't you tell
your brother, Jack, to tune in...

596
00:40:16,253 --> 00:40:17,277
and I'll
sing him something.

597
00:40:17,388 --> 00:40:18,650
What does he like?

598
00:40:18,756 --> 00:40:23,193
Oh, that's-that's sweet,
but, uh, he passed.

599
00:40:23,294 --> 00:40:25,091
I'm sorry.

600
00:40:25,196 --> 00:40:26,527
Were y'all real close?

601
00:40:26,630 --> 00:40:29,098
Yeah.

602
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:31,566
Yeah, he's, uh...

603
00:40:35,039 --> 00:40:40,102
It's funny, I ain't talked about
Jack in a long time, you know?

604
00:40:40,211 --> 00:40:45,046
After he died, I...
I talked about him all the time...

605
00:40:45,149 --> 00:40:50,451
but, uh... I guess people
grew tired of it.

606
00:40:50,554 --> 00:40:53,614
So I just stopped.

607
00:40:59,163 --> 00:41:01,461
John?

608
00:41:05,102 --> 00:41:09,471
You're tired,
aren't you?

609
00:41:09,573 --> 00:41:11,803
Yeah.

610
00:41:11,909 --> 00:41:16,141
It'll slow down.

611
00:41:16,247 --> 00:41:18,340
It will.

612
00:41:18,449 --> 00:41:22,146
I better get going.

613
00:41:22,253 --> 00:41:23,845
It's good to talk to you.

614
00:41:23,954 --> 00:41:25,012
You, too.

615
00:41:25,122 --> 00:41:26,589
Take care.

616
00:41:26,690 --> 00:41:27,657
I'll see you soon.

617
00:41:27,758 --> 00:41:28,850
You better tune in...

618
00:41:28,959 --> 00:41:30,517
I'm going to sing you
that "Swallerin' Place."

619
00:41:30,628 --> 00:41:32,357
I will, I
really will.

620
00:41:32,463 --> 00:41:36,160
Okay.

621
00:41:36,267 --> 00:41:36,800
(man singing on radio)

622
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:39,564
(man singing on radio)

623
00:41:46,944 --> 00:41:49,105
That's fine, that's perfect.

624
00:41:49,213 --> 00:41:51,238
Yes, ma'am.

625
00:41:53,751 --> 00:41:56,151
When was the last time you heard him
moving around in there?

626
00:41:56,253 --> 00:41:57,720
I don't know.

627
00:42:01,225 --> 00:42:03,216
(radio continues)

628
00:42:07,331 --> 00:42:09,697
Thought you were going
to help me today, John.

629
00:42:17,274 --> 00:42:19,799
You head out tomorrow.

630
00:42:19,910 --> 00:42:21,207
Yeah.

631
00:42:21,312 --> 00:42:22,506
Yeah.

632
00:42:22,613 --> 00:42:26,879
Better start living life
here with us when you come home...

633
00:42:26,984 --> 00:42:29,384
before you have to leave again.

634
00:42:29,486 --> 00:42:33,650
Hey, you know, I was thinking.

635
00:42:33,757 --> 00:42:37,523
You know, maybe I could get Bob
to push my dates.

636
00:42:37,628 --> 00:42:41,257
I'm happy
when I'm here.

637
00:42:41,365 --> 00:42:45,358
I like waking up
and seeing your face.

638
00:42:53,844 --> 00:42:55,175
(lighter clicks)

639
00:42:55,279 --> 00:42:57,509
John, those bags over there?

640
00:42:57,615 --> 00:42:58,912
Hmm.

641
00:42:59,016 --> 00:43:02,782
Those letters in there
are ten to one from girls.

642
00:43:02,887 --> 00:43:06,846
Ten to one, and they're obscene.

643
00:43:06,957 --> 00:43:08,857
Reba's been trying
to answer some of them...

644
00:43:08,959 --> 00:43:10,927
but, you know,
half of them ain't even 15...

645
00:43:11,028 --> 00:43:14,623
and they are sending pictures
of themselves in bathing suits.

646
00:43:14,732 --> 00:43:16,029
Pictures for you to look at

647
00:43:16,133 --> 00:43:18,397
while you're doing time
at Folsom.

648
00:43:18,502 --> 00:43:21,130
(chuckles)
Oh, Viv.

649
00:43:21,238 --> 00:43:22,569
This one girl,
she sent you...

650
00:43:22,673 --> 00:43:26,074
Viv, you know, don't even read
those letters, you know...

651
00:43:26,176 --> 00:43:28,701
It's just crazy right now,
that's all.

652
00:43:28,812 --> 00:43:30,609
You know?

653
00:43:30,714 --> 00:43:33,615
Hell, you should have seen
last week.

654
00:43:33,717 --> 00:43:36,049
We was at the fair, and, uh...

655
00:43:36,153 --> 00:43:38,781
this bus full of 4H girls
pulls up, you know...

656
00:43:38,889 --> 00:43:40,550
and they come piling
out of there...

657
00:43:40,658 --> 00:43:42,148
and they go running
and screaming

658
00:43:42,259 --> 00:43:44,454
after Carl and Roy,
I mean running.

659
00:43:44,561 --> 00:43:47,826
John... I have a casserole
in the oven and your sister

660
00:43:47,931 --> 00:43:51,731
in the kitchen, and I don't want
to talk about the tour.

661
00:43:51,835 --> 00:43:56,499
(muttering):
Viv, you're the one who brought it up.

662
00:43:56,607 --> 00:43:58,837
In fact,
that's my new rule.

663
00:43:58,943 --> 00:44:00,570
When you come home,
I want to get

664
00:44:00,678 --> 00:44:03,875
right down to talking
about regular things.

665
00:44:03,981 --> 00:44:05,972
Viv, don't give
me no rules.

666
00:44:06,083 --> 00:44:07,573
All I got are rules.

667
00:44:07,685 --> 00:44:10,119
All I got is to be at this place
at this time.

668
00:44:10,220 --> 00:44:12,586
I'm trying to go there,
and I'm trying to be back here

669
00:44:12,690 --> 00:44:14,214
and spend time
with you and the kids...

670
00:44:14,325 --> 00:44:15,314
and write songs, do this-

671
00:44:15,426 --> 00:44:17,394
I mean, what do you want
from me, all right?

672
00:44:17,494 --> 00:44:20,122
I got you your dream house,
all of your things...

673
00:44:20,230 --> 00:44:21,458
all the pretty little things.

674
00:44:21,565 --> 00:44:22,793
I got you your car.

675
00:44:22,900 --> 00:44:24,094
What do you want from me?!

676
00:44:24,201 --> 00:44:26,795
I want you, John, I want you!

677
00:44:26,904 --> 00:44:30,203
And I want everything
that you promised to me.

678
00:44:30,307 --> 00:44:33,538
Well, what if I can't do that?

679
00:44:39,016 --> 00:44:41,746
(guitar playing lively beat)

680
00:44:47,624 --> 00:44:51,685
(man singing on radio)

681
00:44:58,936 --> 00:45:01,666
(singing continues)

682
00:45:01,772 --> 00:45:03,296
Got your mind on something?

683
00:45:05,542 --> 00:45:07,169
CARL:
What are you doing up there, man?

684
00:45:07,277 --> 00:45:10,440
I'm building a bomb.

685
00:45:10,547 --> 00:45:12,777
Where we going again?

686
00:45:12,883 --> 00:45:16,114
Tyler. The
GeorgeJones show.

687
00:45:16,220 --> 00:45:18,654
Where was it we just was?

688
00:45:18,756 --> 00:45:20,451
Have another one, Carl.

689
00:45:20,557 --> 00:45:21,546
Austin, Carl.
That's where

690
00:45:21,658 --> 00:45:23,455
y'all picked me up.

691
00:45:23,560 --> 00:45:26,120
Hey, Johnny, you see
the new charts?

692
00:45:26,230 --> 00:45:28,095
"Cry, Cry, Cry"
was 14, I think.

693
00:45:28,198 --> 00:45:30,098
Yeah, I heard that.
I haven't seen it.

694
00:45:30,200 --> 00:45:34,796
Wherever we been, I can
tell you where we're going.

695
00:45:34,905 --> 00:45:38,807
Everybody in this car
is going to hell.

696
00:45:38,909 --> 00:45:41,139
What about the
car up there?

697
00:45:41,245 --> 00:45:44,009
We're all going to hell
for the songs we sing.

698
00:45:44,114 --> 00:45:46,139
People that listen to them,
they're going to hell, too.

699
00:45:46,250 --> 00:45:48,514
Shut up with that.

700
00:45:48,619 --> 00:45:50,951
God gave us a great
big apple, see, and He said...

701
00:45:51,054 --> 00:45:52,214
"Don't touch it."

702
00:45:52,322 --> 00:45:54,313
He didn't say
touch it once in a while.

703
00:45:54,425 --> 00:45:56,086
He didn't say take a nibble
when you're hungry.

704
00:45:56,193 --> 00:45:58,218
He said, "Don't touch it.

705
00:45:58,328 --> 00:46:00,523
Don't think
about touching it.

706
00:46:00,631 --> 00:46:01,928
Don't sing about touching it.

707
00:46:02,032 --> 00:46:07,971
Don't think about singing
about touching it."

708
00:46:08,072 --> 00:46:10,438
Well, what about me,
Jerry Lee?

709
00:46:10,541 --> 00:46:12,406
Am I going to hell?

710
00:46:12,509 --> 00:46:16,206
No, June, you're beautiful.

711
00:46:16,313 --> 00:46:18,838
Sleepy is what I am.

712
00:46:22,553 --> 00:46:24,885
She's making me fall
in love with her.

713
00:46:24,988 --> 00:46:27,286
(laughing)

714
00:46:27,391 --> 00:46:30,189
Feel my heart. Come here.

715
00:46:30,294 --> 00:46:31,318
Sincerely.

716
00:46:31,428 --> 00:46:32,554
Feel my heart, baby.

717
00:46:32,663 --> 00:46:34,130
It's just a-beating for you.

718
00:46:34,231 --> 00:46:35,220
Stop it, Jerry.

719
00:46:35,332 --> 00:46:37,232
Come on, I'm falling
for you, June.

720
00:46:37,334 --> 00:46:38,631
(laughing)

721
00:46:38,735 --> 00:46:39,633
Hey. Jerry Lee.

722
00:46:39,736 --> 00:46:40,794
J UNE:
Jerry Lee, stop it.

723
00:46:40,904 --> 00:46:42,132
JOHNNY:
Jerry Lee, just sit your ass down.

724
00:46:42,239 --> 00:46:44,139
Just sit down.

725
00:46:44,241 --> 00:46:46,675
MAN (over radio):
The 1957 Chevrolet...

726
00:46:46,777 --> 00:46:48,768
- (horns honking)
- Looks like we're here.

727
00:46:48,879 --> 00:46:50,938
(horn honks)

728
00:46:51,048 --> 00:46:52,481
Oh, thank goodness.

729
00:46:52,583 --> 00:46:54,642
Get me out of this car
and all these boys.

730
00:47:03,427 --> 00:47:05,418
(tires squeal)

731
00:47:07,698 --> 00:47:09,359
Let's go,
home sweet home, boys.

732
00:47:11,101 --> 00:47:13,399
If you could just put those
right there, that'd be great.

733
00:47:15,439 --> 00:47:16,633
Oh, wait.

734
00:47:16,740 --> 00:47:18,640
I wanted
to give you that Billboard.

735
00:47:18,742 --> 00:47:20,710
Oh, right.

736
00:47:22,980 --> 00:47:24,948
It's in here somewhere.

737
00:47:26,216 --> 00:47:28,878
You got a library
in there, June.

738
00:47:30,821 --> 00:47:32,118
Here it is.

739
00:47:32,222 --> 00:47:33,519
I circled it for you.

740
00:47:33,624 --> 00:47:34,989
- Hmm.
- It's right there.

741
00:47:35,092 --> 00:47:36,184
Yeah.

742
00:47:36,293 --> 00:47:38,625
Fourteen.

743
00:47:38,729 --> 00:47:40,253
- (laughs)
- I don't believe it.

744
00:47:41,632 --> 00:47:42,963
(soft chuckle)

745
00:47:43,066 --> 00:47:45,591
Um, I wanted to
give you this.

746
00:47:46,904 --> 00:47:48,804
Yeah, I just finished it.

747
00:47:48,906 --> 00:47:50,498
It's really amazing.

748
00:47:50,607 --> 00:47:51,801
The Prophet?

749
00:47:51,909 --> 00:47:53,809
Yeah.

750
00:47:53,911 --> 00:47:55,105
Keep it.

751
00:47:55,212 --> 00:47:56,406
Oh, no, you don't want to...

752
00:47:56,513 --> 00:47:58,947
Whenever I finish a book,
I give it away to somebody.

753
00:47:59,049 --> 00:48:00,516
Just lightens my load.

754
00:48:02,519 --> 00:48:04,180
John.

755
00:48:08,959 --> 00:48:10,950
I just went through
a terrible divorce.

756
00:48:13,964 --> 00:48:16,990
I got a world of
judgment on me right now.

757
00:48:20,871 --> 00:48:22,771
And, um...

758
00:48:22,873 --> 00:48:24,500
it's really none
of my business...

759
00:48:24,608 --> 00:48:27,736
but you seem like
you have a nice family.

760
00:48:29,746 --> 00:48:31,873
I'm sorry.
It just happened.

761
00:48:32,883 --> 00:48:35,249
Just happened?

762
00:48:35,352 --> 00:48:37,513
Yeah.

763
00:48:37,621 --> 00:48:42,081
You wear black 'cause you can't
find anything else to wear?

764
00:48:42,192 --> 00:48:45,787
You found your sound
'cause you can't play no better?

765
00:48:45,896 --> 00:48:48,797
You just tried to kiss me,
because...

766
00:48:48,899 --> 00:48:50,890
it just happened?

767
00:48:54,204 --> 00:48:56,263
You should try taking credit
for something

768
00:48:56,373 --> 00:48:58,967
every once in a while.

769
00:49:00,644 --> 00:49:03,306
John.

770
00:49:12,656 --> 00:49:13,748
Hey, Lou.

771
00:49:13,857 --> 00:49:15,154
Hey, John.

772
00:49:15,259 --> 00:49:16,988
You okay?

773
00:49:17,094 --> 00:49:18,391
I'll let you know
in a few minutes.

774
00:49:18,495 --> 00:49:19,621
How you doing?

775
00:49:19,730 --> 00:49:20,890
Okay.

776
00:49:20,998 --> 00:49:23,592
That boy Elvis sure likes
to talk poon.

777
00:49:23,700 --> 00:49:26,464
That's all I heard
since Lubbock.

778
00:49:26,570 --> 00:49:27,764
Ease off, ease off.

779
00:49:27,871 --> 00:49:29,270
Do you want some?

780
00:49:29,373 --> 00:49:30,806
What is it?

781
00:49:32,609 --> 00:49:33,906
Well, it'll just make you want

782
00:49:34,011 --> 00:49:35,774
to drive all the way
toJacksonville

783
00:49:35,879 --> 00:49:37,779
and enjoy yourself
once you get there.

784
00:49:37,881 --> 00:49:39,712
Elvis takes 'em.

785
00:49:41,551 --> 00:49:43,781
Yeah.

786
00:49:48,125 --> 00:49:49,820
Yes, sir...

787
00:49:49,926 --> 00:49:51,860
Be careful.

788
00:49:51,962 --> 00:49:53,657
Here comes Marshall
with his bomb.

789
00:49:53,764 --> 00:49:54,992
Hey, you got your
lighter,J.R.?

790
00:49:56,066 --> 00:49:57,363
Yeah.

791
00:49:57,467 --> 00:49:59,628
All right, you help
me get up in there.

792
00:49:59,736 --> 00:50:01,499
- Grab that fuse.
- All right.

793
00:50:01,605 --> 00:50:03,300
How long we got us
after we light it?

794
00:50:03,407 --> 00:50:05,500
About 30 seconds
a foot.

795
00:50:05,609 --> 00:50:06,871
All right.

796
00:50:09,946 --> 00:50:12,881
Does your wife know how much
you like to blow stuff up?

797
00:50:12,983 --> 00:50:14,109
Sure she does.

798
00:50:14,217 --> 00:50:16,117
That's why
I married her, John.

799
00:50:16,219 --> 00:50:17,709
Did you light it?

800
00:50:17,821 --> 00:50:20,688
There's a bomb up here,
ladies and gentlemen.

801
00:50:20,791 --> 00:50:22,588
MAN:
It'll go...

802
00:50:22,693 --> 00:50:23,819
(indistinct mumbling)

803
00:50:23,927 --> 00:50:25,895
(indistinct chatter)

804
00:50:27,831 --> 00:50:29,731
J ERRY LEE:
Way to go, Johnny boy.

805
00:50:29,833 --> 00:50:33,564
(loud explosion and shouting)

806
00:50:33,670 --> 00:50:35,297
(rock and roll music playing)

807
00:50:35,405 --> 00:50:38,169
(singing)

808
00:51:04,801 --> 00:51:07,668
(singing continues)

809
00:51:21,818 --> 00:51:23,786
(song ends)

810
00:51:23,887 --> 00:51:26,355
(applause and cheering)

811
00:51:28,125 --> 00:51:29,217
Thank you.

812
00:51:29,326 --> 00:51:30,725
Thank you very much.

813
00:51:30,827 --> 00:51:33,318
(cheering)

814
00:51:34,664 --> 00:51:36,962
How about them boys, huh?

815
00:51:37,067 --> 00:51:39,262
Johnny Cash
and the Tennessee Three.

816
00:51:40,670 --> 00:51:42,001
You kicked it good
tonight, John.

817
00:51:42,105 --> 00:51:43,163
Thanks, man.

818
00:51:43,273 --> 00:51:45,002
That's right,
kiss his ass.

819
00:51:45,108 --> 00:51:46,336
Hey, Jerry Lee, your
mama know you're out?

820
00:51:46,443 --> 00:51:47,501
She knows.

821
00:51:47,611 --> 00:51:48,509
(laughs)

822
00:51:48,612 --> 00:51:49,636
She knows.

823
00:51:49,746 --> 00:51:52,374
How about thatJohnny Cash,
everybody?

824
00:51:52,482 --> 00:51:54,950
- (cheering)
- Johnny Cash!

825
00:51:55,051 --> 00:51:57,849
(applause and cheering)

826
00:51:57,954 --> 00:52:01,355
(guitar strumming
lively rock melody)

827
00:52:01,458 --> 00:52:03,790
(applause and cheering)

828
00:52:03,894 --> 00:52:05,794
(singing)

829
00:52:14,704 --> 00:52:18,071
(singing continues)

830
00:52:38,228 --> 00:52:39,422
Okay, now.

831
00:52:39,529 --> 00:52:41,588
(instrumental interlude,
women screaming)

832
00:52:44,901 --> 00:52:46,892
(muffled music playing)

833
00:52:56,146 --> 00:52:57,408
MAN (knocking):
Mr. Cash?

834
00:52:57,514 --> 00:52:58,981
Yeah?

835
00:52:59,082 --> 00:53:00,982
There's a Miss Audrey
Parks here to see you.

836
00:53:02,485 --> 00:53:03,952
Who?

837
00:53:04,054 --> 00:53:06,113
Audrey Parks.

838
00:53:07,557 --> 00:53:08,956
(singing resumes)

839
00:53:13,597 --> 00:53:15,030
Well, hey.

840
00:53:32,115 --> 00:53:34,208
ELVIS:
Oh, get it now.!

841
00:53:34,317 --> 00:53:36,410
(instrumental interlude)

842
00:53:36,519 --> 00:53:38,578
(baby crying)

843
00:53:41,458 --> 00:53:43,119
CARRI E:
Ray, why don't you say grace?

844
00:53:43,226 --> 00:53:45,057
RAY:
Mama, it's J.R.'s table.

845
00:53:45,161 --> 00:53:47,629
Why don't you say grace,J.R.?

846
00:53:47,731 --> 00:53:49,358
No, go ahead.

847
00:53:49,466 --> 00:53:51,366
(singing resumes)

848
00:53:51,468 --> 00:53:53,459
(indistinct shouting)

849
00:53:57,140 --> 00:53:59,335
(mumbling)

850
00:53:59,442 --> 00:54:01,069
Mm-hmm.

851
00:54:06,016 --> 00:54:07,210
ELVIS:
Yeah.!

852
00:54:07,317 --> 00:54:09,512
(indistinct chatter
and laughing)

853
00:54:09,619 --> 00:54:11,587
(laughter)

854
00:54:13,290 --> 00:54:14,587
WOMAN:
Hi.

855
00:54:14,691 --> 00:54:16,921
Hi.

856
00:54:17,027 --> 00:54:19,120
(indistinct whispering)

857
00:54:22,699 --> 00:54:25,896
You'reJune Carter,
ain't ya?

858
00:54:26,002 --> 00:54:27,230
Oh, my.

859
00:54:27,337 --> 00:54:28,531
Betsy Pervis.

860
00:54:28,638 --> 00:54:29,662
Hi, Betsy.
So nice to meet you.

861
00:54:29,773 --> 00:54:30,933
Well, we're coming
to see the show tonight.

862
00:54:31,041 --> 00:54:31,939
Oh, wonderful.

863
00:54:32,042 --> 00:54:33,407
This is my husband, Lloyd.

864
00:54:33,510 --> 00:54:34,909
Hi, Lloyd. So
nice to meet you.

865
00:54:35,011 --> 00:54:36,103
Y'all wouldn't know

866
00:54:36,212 --> 00:54:37,645
where the fishin' tackle is,
would you?

867
00:54:37,747 --> 00:54:39,681
Back of... back
of them footballs on the corner.

868
00:54:39,783 --> 00:54:41,250
Oh. All
right, great.

869
00:54:41,351 --> 00:54:43,478
Well, y'all enjoy the show,
and if you have any requests...

870
00:54:43,586 --> 00:54:44,712
just holler 'em out.

871
00:54:44,821 --> 00:54:46,152
- Morning.
- Hey.

872
00:54:46,256 --> 00:54:48,724
(indistinct whisperings)

873
00:55:08,044 --> 00:55:09,477
Oh, can I help you?

874
00:55:09,579 --> 00:55:11,638
Oh, um, I'm looking
for some lace.

875
00:55:11,748 --> 00:55:15,081
Oh, the sewing store
on Saticoy's got lace.

876
00:55:15,185 --> 00:55:16,652
Thank you.

877
00:55:18,054 --> 00:55:21,114
You know, your ma and pa
are good Christians

878
00:55:21,224 --> 00:55:22,555
in a world gone to pot.

879
00:55:22,659 --> 00:55:24,354
Well, I'll tell 'em
you said that.

880
00:55:24,461 --> 00:55:26,588
I'm surprised
they still speak to you

881
00:55:26,696 --> 00:55:29,529
after that stunt
with Carl Smith.

882
00:55:29,632 --> 00:55:31,623
Divorce is an abomination.

883
00:55:31,735 --> 00:55:33,703
Marriage is for life.

884
00:55:36,139 --> 00:55:38,505
I'm sorry I let you down, ma'am.

885
00:55:40,710 --> 00:55:42,735
(country song plays low
on radio)

886
00:55:55,291 --> 00:55:56,383
Hey.

887
00:55:56,493 --> 00:55:57,653
(laughs):
Hey.

888
00:55:57,761 --> 00:55:58,955
What's funny?

889
00:55:59,062 --> 00:56:01,189
Well, you've just been standing
in that same spot

890
00:56:01,297 --> 00:56:03,959
for about ten minutes staring
at that Polly Pepper book.

891
00:56:04,067 --> 00:56:05,796
(chuckles):
Well... well, I can't...

892
00:56:05,902 --> 00:56:08,769
I can't figure out which one
Roseanne would like more.

893
00:56:08,872 --> 00:56:11,500
She got brown hair, which
makes me think this one.

894
00:56:11,608 --> 00:56:14,372
- Right.
- But this is baby sister's...

895
00:56:14,477 --> 00:56:16,570
and she got a baby
sister, and...

896
00:56:16,679 --> 00:56:19,512
Well, I got that one
for Carlene, and she liked it.

897
00:56:19,616 --> 00:56:21,311
Oh, yeah?

898
00:56:21,418 --> 00:56:23,352
(whispers):
I missed her birthday.

899
00:56:23,453 --> 00:56:25,921
- Oh.
- So I wanted to get her something more...

900
00:56:26,022 --> 00:56:28,217
you know,
like one of these dollhouses.

901
00:56:28,324 --> 00:56:29,689
But I don't know how

902
00:56:29,793 --> 00:56:31,283
to get it out to her.

903
00:56:31,394 --> 00:56:33,453
You want me to help you?

904
00:56:36,666 --> 00:56:39,897
I think there's a lake
right up around the corner.

905
00:56:48,478 --> 00:56:51,641
- Got a hitch in your giddy-up?
- Yeah.

906
00:57:11,701 --> 00:57:15,034
Forgot how much
I like this.

907
00:57:15,138 --> 00:57:16,605
Hey, June?

908
00:57:16,706 --> 00:57:19,903
I never used one of these
fancy reels before.

909
00:57:20,009 --> 00:57:21,943
Well, what'd you
use, a sapling?

910
00:57:22,045 --> 00:57:23,945
- Yeah.
- (laughs)

911
00:57:24,047 --> 00:57:26,607
Okay, hold on,
I'll help you.

912
00:57:26,716 --> 00:57:29,708
- It's like there's some kind of a lock on it or...
- No.

913
00:57:29,819 --> 00:57:32,185
My daddy taught me how to do this;
I'll show you.

914
00:57:32,288 --> 00:57:33,983
Keep your thumb down
on the button.

915
00:57:34,090 --> 00:57:35,250
That loosens the line.

916
00:57:35,358 --> 00:57:37,019
And then you're gonna
bring it back...

917
00:57:37,127 --> 00:57:38,958
and then you're gonna
throw it out there...

918
00:57:39,062 --> 00:57:40,256
and then when you're ready...

919
00:57:40,363 --> 00:57:43,821
if you got a good spot for it,
you let go of the button.

920
00:57:43,933 --> 00:57:45,298
- All right?
- Side-arm?

921
00:57:45,401 --> 00:57:46,459
Yeah, side-arm.

922
00:57:46,569 --> 00:57:48,196
All right.

923
00:57:50,907 --> 00:57:53,603
See? There you go.
(laughs)

924
00:58:05,221 --> 00:58:06,556
(intro to "Home of the Blues"
playing)

925
00:58:06,556 --> 00:58:08,490
(intro to "Home of the Blues"
playing)

926
00:58:12,362 --> 00:58:16,492
(singing)

927
00:58:41,658 --> 00:58:43,057
(song ends)

928
00:58:43,159 --> 00:58:45,354
(applause, cheering
and whistling)

929
00:58:47,030 --> 00:58:50,363
Hey, folks, what do you say
we getJune Carter out here again?

930
00:58:50,466 --> 00:58:52,366
Maybe she'll, uh,
sing with me.

931
00:58:52,468 --> 00:58:54,459
- (loud cheering)
- No, no, no, no.

932
00:58:54,571 --> 00:58:56,698
Now, come on, June,
I never sing with you.

933
00:58:56,806 --> 00:58:59,366
I have my slippers on.
I'm not coming out there.

934
00:58:59,475 --> 00:59:01,773
Well, they don't care
if you got your slippers on.

935
00:59:01,878 --> 00:59:03,675
Come on, it's for the sake
of the evening.

936
00:59:03,780 --> 00:59:06,146
Folks, let's hear it:
June, June...

937
00:59:06,249 --> 00:59:09,548
(crowdjoins in):
June, June, June, June...

938
00:59:09,652 --> 00:59:12,314
- June, June, June, June...
- JOHNNY: Come on, June.

939
00:59:12,422 --> 00:59:14,151
Prove Elvis wrong.

940
00:59:14,257 --> 00:59:17,488
He says you can't do nothing that ain't
written in your calendar.

941
00:59:17,594 --> 00:59:20,757
- (laughter)
- June, June, June, June, June, June...

942
00:59:20,864 --> 00:59:22,832
June, June, June...

943
00:59:22,932 --> 00:59:27,494
June, June, June, June,
June, June, June, June...

944
00:59:27,604 --> 00:59:29,299
(cheering and applause)

945
00:59:30,373 --> 00:59:32,364
- (laughs)
- You see, June?

946
00:59:32,475 --> 00:59:34,534
- They want to see us together.
- All right, well...

947
00:59:34,644 --> 00:59:37,044
quit that clutching on me,
and I'll sing with you...

948
00:59:37,146 --> 00:59:39,046
but you got to quit
clutching on me.

949
00:59:39,148 --> 00:59:40,877
Hi, folks.
How y'all doing again?

950
00:59:40,984 --> 00:59:43,316
I hope y'all don't mind
my bare feet.

951
00:59:43,419 --> 00:59:45,717
So, what are we
gonna sing, Johnny?

952
00:59:45,822 --> 00:59:47,255
You got me out here.

953
00:59:47,357 --> 00:59:49,257
Is that where
your plan ends?

954
00:59:49,359 --> 00:59:51,452
- (laughter)
- Well, uh... I always liked

955
00:59:51,561 --> 00:59:53,222
that song of yours,
"Time's a Wastin'."

956
00:59:53,329 --> 00:59:54,523
- (cheering)
- Let's do that one.

957
00:59:54,631 --> 00:59:56,599
Oh, come on,
I don't know about that.

958
00:59:56,699 --> 00:59:58,462
How about your hit song,
"Big River"?

959
00:59:58,568 --> 01:00:00,160
- (applause)
- That's a good song.

960
01:00:00,270 --> 01:00:02,135
Well, "Big River"
ain't a duet.

961
01:00:02,238 --> 01:00:04,035
Uh, let's do
"Time's a Wastin"'.

962
01:00:04,140 --> 01:00:05,971
John, I am not
gonna sing that song.

963
01:00:06,075 --> 01:00:06,973
It's inappropriate.

964
01:00:07,076 --> 01:00:08,202
I recorded it with
my ex-husband.

965
01:00:08,311 --> 01:00:09,801
- I'm not going to sing it.
- (music starts)

966
01:00:09,913 --> 01:00:11,710
There's no better way
to put it behind you.

967
01:00:11,814 --> 01:00:13,304
I'm not gonna do it.

968
01:00:13,416 --> 01:00:14,781
June, let's sing.

969
01:00:14,884 --> 01:00:16,476
(Johnny singing)

970
01:00:16,586 --> 01:00:17,814
(June singing)

971
01:01:10,707 --> 01:01:13,335
Don't do that!

972
01:01:13,443 --> 01:01:15,673
Hey, June.

973
01:01:26,389 --> 01:01:28,653
June?

974
01:01:28,758 --> 01:01:29,986
Open up.

975
01:01:30,093 --> 01:01:31,355
June, open the door.

976
01:01:31,461 --> 01:01:34,658
Just leave me be,
John, all right?

977
01:01:34,764 --> 01:01:36,857
What?

978
01:01:36,966 --> 01:01:39,867
W-What did I do?

979
01:01:39,969 --> 01:01:41,129
June, it's a song.

980
01:01:41,237 --> 01:01:45,571
Just please get away from me.

981
01:01:45,675 --> 01:01:49,167
(R& B song playing faintly)

982
01:02:16,172 --> 01:02:18,606
(water running)

983
01:02:18,708 --> 01:02:21,677
(panting)

984
01:02:29,652 --> 01:02:30,550
(shakes pills)

985
01:02:30,653 --> 01:02:31,620
(bottle drops to floor)

986
01:02:38,694 --> 01:02:40,559
(bottle rattles on floor)

987
01:02:42,899 --> 01:02:44,890
(Johnny singing on radio)

988
01:02:47,170 --> 01:02:49,832
(guitar solo plays)

989
01:02:49,939 --> 01:02:52,874
DEEJAY: I think I hearJohnny Cash
and the Tennessee Three.

990
01:02:52,975 --> 01:02:55,102
They'll be playing
all weekend long at the Malco.

991
01:02:55,211 --> 01:02:57,509
Matinees and evening shows,
along with Jerry Lee Lewis...

992
01:02:57,613 --> 01:03:00,582
June Carter and Carl Perkins.

993
01:03:04,520 --> 01:03:06,420
(radio continues)

994
01:03:14,997 --> 01:03:16,760
(men singing)

995
01:03:21,904 --> 01:03:23,462
- (singing continues)
- (laughing)

996
01:03:23,573 --> 01:03:24,471
It's the candy man.

997
01:03:24,574 --> 01:03:26,235
Is the candy man
likeJerry Lee, there?

998
01:03:26,342 --> 01:03:28,469
How come you don't never try
this brand of picking, Luther?

999
01:03:28,578 --> 01:03:30,808
(plays bluesy riff)

1000
01:03:33,850 --> 01:03:36,444
What you're looking for,
Waylon, I already found.

1001
01:03:36,552 --> 01:03:38,918
(singing resumes)

1002
01:03:45,528 --> 01:03:47,962
LEWIS:
Well, hey, June.

1003
01:03:48,064 --> 01:03:50,225
Hey, Jerry Lee.

1004
01:03:52,902 --> 01:03:54,494
(laughter)

1005
01:03:54,604 --> 01:03:55,866
How you doin', John?

1006
01:03:55,972 --> 01:03:59,203
(laughter)

1007
01:03:59,308 --> 01:04:01,674
Uh...

1008
01:04:01,777 --> 01:04:02,675
Well, okay, June.

1009
01:04:02,778 --> 01:04:04,109
How you doing?

1010
01:04:04,213 --> 01:04:07,046
I surmise you've
never been to bed.

1011
01:04:07,150 --> 01:04:08,310
Surmise...

1012
01:04:08,417 --> 01:04:10,044
We've got a show
at 2:00, a matinee.

1013
01:04:10,152 --> 01:04:11,813
- You remember that?
- LEWIS: We were just practicing.

1014
01:04:11,921 --> 01:04:13,980
Oh, come on,
June, sit down.

1015
01:04:14,090 --> 01:04:14,988
It's slick here.

1016
01:04:15,091 --> 01:04:16,615
Not today, Jerry Lee.

1017
01:04:16,726 --> 01:04:18,216
Why not?

1018
01:04:18,327 --> 01:04:19,419
'Cause you're drunk.

1019
01:04:19,529 --> 01:04:20,461
MAN:
Uh-oh!

1020
01:04:20,563 --> 01:04:22,497
- (laughing)
- Whoo!

1021
01:04:24,433 --> 01:04:27,163
Come on, Junie,
just come have a beer with us.

1022
01:04:27,270 --> 01:04:29,704
I'm going home tonight
after the show.

1023
01:04:29,805 --> 01:04:32,205
I'm not here
to look after y'all.

1024
01:04:34,277 --> 01:04:35,744
You're not?

1025
01:04:35,845 --> 01:04:39,337
(glass shattering)

1026
01:04:39,448 --> 01:04:42,281
You got somebody
to do that for you, John.

1027
01:04:42,385 --> 01:04:44,012
You got a wife somewhere,
you remember that?

1028
01:04:44,120 --> 01:04:45,678
Ooh!

1029
01:04:45,788 --> 01:04:47,483
What if I didn't?

1030
01:04:47,590 --> 01:04:50,616
There's too many "ifs"
in that sentence.

1031
01:04:50,726 --> 01:04:52,159
Only one, actually.

1032
01:04:52,261 --> 01:04:55,492
There's only one "if"
in that sentence, June.

1033
01:04:55,598 --> 01:04:57,862
(laughter)

1034
01:04:57,967 --> 01:05:00,265
L-I thought it
was a good point.

1035
01:05:00,369 --> 01:05:01,336
There is only one.

1036
01:05:01,437 --> 01:05:03,837
Really?

1037
01:05:03,940 --> 01:05:05,373
(glass shattering)

1038
01:05:05,474 --> 01:05:06,702
(men shouting)

1039
01:05:07,777 --> 01:05:10,075
How dare you
talk to me like that!

1040
01:05:10,179 --> 01:05:12,704
We surrender!
We surrender!

1041
01:05:12,815 --> 01:05:13,804
What was I thinking?

1042
01:05:13,916 --> 01:05:15,440
I must have been crazy.

1043
01:05:15,551 --> 01:05:17,781
Y'all are gonna blow this tour.

1044
01:05:17,887 --> 01:05:21,379
You can't walk no line.

1045
01:05:21,490 --> 01:05:22,821
June, we ain't blowing the tour.

1046
01:05:22,925 --> 01:05:24,222
I am not gonna be

1047
01:05:24,327 --> 01:05:27,694
that little Dutch boy with my
finger in the dam no more!

1048
01:05:27,797 --> 01:05:29,162
You're lying to yourself
if you think

1049
01:05:29,265 --> 01:05:30,425
this is about a tour, honey.

1050
01:05:30,533 --> 01:05:32,364
This isn't about a tour!

1051
01:05:32,468 --> 01:05:34,570
This isn't about a song!

1052
01:05:34,870 --> 01:05:37,634
(shuffling rhythm playing)

1053
01:05:50,820 --> 01:05:55,416
(singing)

1054
01:06:00,129 --> 01:06:04,691
(singing continues)

1055
01:06:12,875 --> 01:06:17,403
(singing resumes)

1056
01:06:25,288 --> 01:06:26,778
John.

1057
01:06:26,889 --> 01:06:29,050
Honey, let's take a picture
of Roseanne.

1058
01:06:29,158 --> 01:06:31,183
C'mon, say cheese!

1059
01:06:31,293 --> 01:06:33,659
(indistinct voices)

1060
01:06:52,248 --> 01:06:54,113
REPORTER:
What do you think of California, Mr. Cash?

1061
01:06:54,216 --> 01:06:56,548
We like it. We just
bought a house.

1062
01:06:56,652 --> 01:07:01,282
(singing continues)

1063
01:07:13,135 --> 01:07:16,161
(song ends)

1064
01:07:29,983 --> 01:07:33,077
(gulls cawing)

1065
01:07:33,186 --> 01:07:35,518
VIVIAN:
Lunch time!

1066
01:07:35,622 --> 01:07:37,783
Come on in, everybody.

1067
01:07:46,366 --> 01:07:48,527
VIVIAN:
What is this?

1068
01:07:48,635 --> 01:07:50,034
I've been looking for that.

1069
01:07:50,136 --> 01:07:52,229
That's the letter I wrote
to Bob Dylan on a plane.

1070
01:07:52,338 --> 01:07:53,430
Hey, Mama, that's
that folk singer

1071
01:07:53,540 --> 01:07:54,768
I was telling you about.

1072
01:07:54,874 --> 01:07:57,570
You wrote it on
an air sickness bag, honey.

1073
01:07:57,677 --> 01:07:58,803
So what?

1074
01:07:58,912 --> 01:08:00,777
(chuckles)

1075
01:08:00,880 --> 01:08:02,609
What's so funny?

1076
01:08:02,715 --> 01:08:04,307
I was thinking
maybe you ought

1077
01:08:04,417 --> 01:08:05,441
to try sleeping
at night.

1078
01:08:05,552 --> 01:08:09,488
Maybe eating,
maybe both.

1079
01:08:11,090 --> 01:08:14,082
Hey, uh, Viv, have you made
your mind up about tonight?

1080
01:08:15,862 --> 01:08:16,954
You coming?

1081
01:08:20,400 --> 01:08:22,834
Okay- 'cause you're asking
so nice.

1082
01:08:22,936 --> 01:08:24,267
(phone ringing)

1083
01:08:24,370 --> 01:08:25,462
I got it.

1084
01:08:29,909 --> 01:08:31,706
- Hello?
- Music awards.

1085
01:08:31,811 --> 01:08:33,779
EMCEE:
We got a British Invasion...

1086
01:08:33,880 --> 01:08:38,112
a beautiful girl from Brazil,
a matchmaker from New York.

1087
01:08:38,218 --> 01:08:39,981
We even had a flying nanny.

1088
01:08:40,086 --> 01:08:42,077
In 1964...

1089
01:08:42,188 --> 01:08:43,086
Hey, Johnny.

1090
01:08:43,189 --> 01:08:44,247
Hey, Randy, how are you?

1091
01:08:46,259 --> 01:08:47,783
June? Hey.

1092
01:08:47,894 --> 01:08:49,691
Hi, John.

1093
01:08:49,796 --> 01:08:50,854
Been a long time.

1094
01:08:50,964 --> 01:08:52,591
Yeah.

1095
01:08:52,699 --> 01:08:53,688
Hi, Vivian, how are you?

1096
01:08:53,800 --> 01:08:56,030
Hello, June.

1097
01:08:56,135 --> 01:08:57,363
I saw you got married.

1098
01:08:57,470 --> 01:09:00,633
Uh, yes, I did.

1099
01:09:00,740 --> 01:09:01,900
Congratulations, June.

1100
01:09:02,008 --> 01:09:02,872
- Thank you, I appreciate that.
- You're welcome.

1101
01:09:02,976 --> 01:09:04,068
So you think
this one will stick?

1102
01:09:04,177 --> 01:09:05,405
VIVIAN:
John!

1103
01:09:05,511 --> 01:09:07,172
JOHNNY:
What is this, your second or your third?

1104
01:09:07,280 --> 01:09:08,440
- John!
- I'm just asking a question.

1105
01:09:10,450 --> 01:09:12,111
Do not do this to me.

1106
01:09:12,218 --> 01:09:13,185
John!

1107
01:09:19,525 --> 01:09:21,220
Oh!

1108
01:09:21,327 --> 01:09:23,192
Hey! June, wait up.
I need to talk to you.

1109
01:09:23,296 --> 01:09:24,661
I don't want
to talk to you, John.

1110
01:09:24,764 --> 01:09:26,755
Hey, excuse me, fella,
do you mind?

1111
01:09:29,235 --> 01:09:30,395
You don't look good, John.

1112
01:09:30,503 --> 01:09:33,233
Well, you look real nice.

1113
01:09:33,339 --> 01:09:36,103
So where's
your truck driver?

1114
01:09:36,209 --> 01:09:37,233
Stock car driver.

1115
01:09:37,343 --> 01:09:38,605
And you'll be happy to know

1116
01:09:38,711 --> 01:09:40,338
that things aren't really
working out between us.

1117
01:09:40,446 --> 01:09:44,041
It doesn't make me happy.

1118
01:09:44,150 --> 01:09:46,311
Well, a little it does.

1119
01:09:49,022 --> 01:09:52,583
I want to tour
with you again, June.

1120
01:09:52,692 --> 01:09:54,660
I miss the tour.

1121
01:09:54,761 --> 01:09:56,058
I mi... I miss the music.

1122
01:09:56,162 --> 01:09:58,062
I got two grown girls, John.

1123
01:09:58,164 --> 01:09:59,131
I can't tour.

1124
01:09:59,232 --> 01:10:01,029
So you're just going
to do a comedy act

1125
01:10:01,134 --> 01:10:02,123
the rest of your life?

1126
01:10:02,235 --> 01:10:04,066
You've got a voice,
June, use it.

1127
01:10:04,170 --> 01:10:07,003
One week a month,
that's all, all right?

1128
01:10:07,106 --> 01:10:08,334
You'll work for me.

1129
01:10:08,441 --> 01:10:09,908
You don't have to worry
about bookings

1130
01:10:10,009 --> 01:10:11,567
or agents, or publicists
or anything.

1131
01:10:11,678 --> 01:10:13,543
All right, one of
your girls gets sick...

1132
01:10:13,646 --> 01:10:16,749
you stay home,
and I pay you, anyways.

1133
01:10:16,749 --> 01:10:16,976
You stay home,
and I pay you, anyways.

1134
01:10:17,083 --> 01:10:19,950
(strumming slow rhythm)

1135
01:10:20,053 --> 01:10:27,789
(singing)

1136
01:10:57,990 --> 01:11:04,520
(singing continues)

1137
01:11:19,479 --> 01:11:21,379
(strumming continues)

1138
01:11:26,919 --> 01:11:30,082
(song ends,
audience applauds, whistles)
