GISELLE, WILL YOU PLEASE
STOP TALKING TO ME LIKE THAT,

21
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:15,700
I'M NOT A CHILD!

22
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:17,900
IF YOU HAVE A COMPLAINT
ABOUT MY WORK,

23
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:19,900

Giselle: <i>SUSAN--</i>

25
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,700
DON'T YOU "SUSAN" ME.

26
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:25,600
I'M HAPPY TO WORK
WITH YOU ON THIS PROJECT,

27
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:29,400
BUT WE HAVE TO HAVE
A SENSIBLE WORKING RELATIONSHIP.

 <i>I AM SORRY.</i>

29
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,300
 <i>THIS IS HOW WE</i>
 <i>DO THINGS IN FRANCE.</i>

30
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:34,800
I RATHER DOUBT THAT.

31
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:36,700
AND BELIEVE ME,
JULIA WILL NOT BE HAPPY

32
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:39,100
THAT YOU ARE TAKING
THIS ATTITUDE.

33
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:41,200
 <i>I AM SORRY,</i>
 <i>MY ENGLISH IS NOT SO GOOD.</i>

34
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,500
 <i>YOU ARE GOING TOO FAST.</i>

35
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:48,100
( speaking French )

36
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:00,600
Giselle: <i>OUI.</i>

37
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:02,900
 <i>AU REVOIR.</i>

00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:05,300
( sighs ) 

39
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:09,900
UH, SORRY.

40
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:13,600
IT'S JUST...

41
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:16,000
WELL, I, UH--

42
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,200
I REALLY LIKE
FRENCH WOMEN, THAT'S ALL.

43
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,200
Jane:
 <i>NO!</i>

44
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,200
HE THOUGHT YOU WERE FRENCH?

45
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:25,600
I THINK THAT WAS
THE ONLY REASON
HE WAS INTERESTED.

46
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:27,200
WHY WERE YOU TALKING
IN FRENCH, ANYWAY?

47
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,900
OH, A NEW CLIENT.

48
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:30,500
GISELLE, THE FRENCH BITCH.

49
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:32,100
THIS IS SOMEONE
YOU DON'T LIKE?

50
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:34,200
OH, I <i>LOVE</i> IT
WHEN THAT HAPPENS.

51
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:36,200
MAKES YOU SEEM
LIKE A PERSON.

52
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:39,200
SHE'S SUPPOSED TO BE
COMING AROUND FOR A DRINK

53
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,400
WITH STEVE AND I
THIS EVENING,

54
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,700
BUT I'VE JUST TOLD HER
TO SOD OFF.

55
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:46,600
IT MUST BE REALLY GREAT
BEING A FRENCH BITCH.

56
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:48,200
IT MUST BE
SO MUCH EASIER.

57
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:49,300
EASIER?

58
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:51,000
I'VE ALWAYS WANTED
TO BE FRENCH,

59
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,700
BUT I'VE NEVER HAD
THE OPPORTUNITIES.

60
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:55,000
SO WHAT WAS THE GUY LIKE?

61
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,800
I'M WITH <i>STEVE</i> NOW.

62
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:59,500
YEAH, BUT IF YOU HAD
A NIGHT OFF FROM STEVE,

63
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:01,200
IS HE THE KIND OF GUY
YOU'D GO FOR?

64
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,700
THERE'S NOBODY
I'D GO FOR--

65
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:04,500
ABSOLUTELY NOBODY,
NOBODY AT ALL.

66
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:05,900
OR AN AUSTRALIAN.

67
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:08,100
AN AUSTRALIAN?
SORRY.

68
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:10,100
I DON'T QUITE KNOW
WHERE THAT CAME FROM.

69
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:13,600
AUSTRALIANS ARE HER WEAKNESS.
SALLY--

70
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:16,600
WE DROVE AROUND AUSTRALIA
TEN YEARS AGO, REMEMBER?

71
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:18,900
I REMEMBER WHO WAS
IN THE DRIVING SEAT
FOR THE WHOLE TRIP.

72
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:20,600
YOUR OVARIES.

73
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:22,500
SHE'S EXAGGERATING.

74
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:25,300
WE ALWAYS KNEW
IT WAS TIME TO SKIP TOWN

75
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:27,700
WHEN A BAR
WAS NAMED AFTER HER.

76
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:30,200
SO THIS GUY,
WAS HE AN AUSTRALIAN?

77
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:32,200
NO, HE WAS JUST A GUY,
NOTHING SPECIAL.

78
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:35,500
ANYWAY, HE ONLY LIKED ME
'CAUSE HE THOUGHT I WAS FRENCH.

79
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:37,400
SO WHAT HAPPENED?

80
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:39,200
HE ASKED ME
IF I HAD A BOYFRIEND,

81
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,300
AND I SAID YES,

82
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:42,100
AND THAT'S ALL
THERE IS TO IT.

83
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:45,500
SO, I BET YOU'VE GOT
A BOYFRIEND THEN, EH?

84
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:48,600
 <i>OUI.</i>

85
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:52,200
YOU LET HIM THINK
YOU WERE FRENCH!

86
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:53,900
WHY?

87
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:56,600
I DON'T KNOW.
IT JUST...HAPPENED.

88
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:59,000
IT WAS JUST...
FUN TO PRETEND.

89
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,800
OH, I KNOW
ALL ABOUT PRETENDING.

90
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:04,200
I ONCE WENT ON HOLIDAY
AND PRETENDED TO BE TWINS.

91
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:06,500
IT WAS AMAZING FUN.

92
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:08,600
I INVENTED THIS MAD,
GLAMOROUS SISTER

93
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:10,800
AND WENT 'ROUND
REALLY ANNOYING EVERYBODY.

94
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:13,800
I COULD GET AWAY WITH ANYTHING
WHEN I WAS MY CRAZY TWIN JANE.

95
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,900
 <i>YOU'RE</i> JANE.

96
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:19,400
KINDA STUCK.
IT'S A LONG STORY.

97
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:22,200
YOU KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE
A YEAR INTO A RELATIONSHIP.

98
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:26,100
STEVE'S WONDERFUL.
I LOVE HIM TO BITS.

99
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:30,000
IT'S JUST--HE NEVER THINKS
I'M FRENCH ANYMORE.

100
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,300
YEAH.
RIGHT.

101
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:33,500
DO YOU KNOW
WHAT I MEAN BY THAT?

102
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:36,200
NO.
NOT AT ALL.

103
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:38,500
WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT
IT'S LIKE AT THE START,

104
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:40,400
WHEN THEY'RE ALL
FIERY-EYED AND EAGER

105
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:41,800
AND THEY HAVEN'T
SEEN YOU NAKED YET.

106
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:44,100
AND IT'S LIKE HE'S
SMASHING AT YOUR DOOR

107
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:45,700
WITH HIS MIGHTY BATTERING RAM,

108
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:48,100
AND HE'S PROMISING
TO RAVISH YOU FOREVER.

109
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:50,600
SO YOU <i>BRACE</i> YOURSELF
FOR MAN OVERLOAD

110
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:52,100
AND THROW OPEN THE DOORS,

111
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:53,600
AND WHAT DO YOU FIND
STANDING THERE?

112
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,700
AN OVERSIZED TODDLER
WHO WANTS HIS DINNER.

113
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:57,100
AND BEFORE YOU CAN SAY

114
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:59,100
THERE'S BEEN
A TERRIBLE MISTAKE,

115
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:00,800
HE'S SNORING ON YOUR SOFA,

116
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:03,000
AND THE WHOLE PLACE
SMELLS OF FEET.

117
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,600
OH, AND NOW I'M FEELING
REALLY GUILTY.

118
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:08,000
I'M GONNA,
UH, PHONE HIM.

119
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,400
NOT ENOUGH SHOES.

120
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,000
WHAT?

121
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,400
MEN-- THEIR FEET
GET SORT OF MARINATED.

122
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:18,300
THAT'S WEIRD.
WHAT?

123
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:20,500
ALL MY PROGRAMED NUMBERS
HAVE GONE.

124
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:22,500
I CAN NEVER PROGRAM IN
MY NUMBERS.

125
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:24,900
NEVER BRING MYSELF TO PUT
MY FRIENDS IN ORDER.

126
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:26,700
OH, I PUT THEM IN
THE ORDER I LIKE THEM.

127
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:27,900
YOU'RE AT NUMBER THREE.

128
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:30,500
NUMBER THREE,
THAT'S PRETTY GOOD.

129
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:31,700
THANK YOU.
YOU'RE WELCOME.

130
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:33,700
WHO'S NUMBER ONE
AND TWO?

131
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:36,400
OH, I HAVEN'T MET
A ONE OR A TWO YET.

132
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:37,700
OH.

133
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:40,600
OR A SEVEN, ACTUALLY.

134
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,200
SO WHERE AM I?

135
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:45,200
I'VE ONLY GOT
TEN SPACES.

136
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:47,800
I WASN'T ABLE TO
SQUEEZE YOU IN.

137
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,600
OKAY.

138
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,100
EXCUSE ME WHILE I TRY

139
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:53,600
TO REMEMBER
MY BOYFRIEND'S NUMBER.

140
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:57,300
SUSAN LIKES AUSTRALIANS?

141
00:05:57,300 --> 00:05:59,300
HER GREATEST FEAR
IS THAT ONE DAY

142
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:01,300
THEY'LL ALL TURN UP
ON HER DOORSTEP

143
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:03,300
AND GRIDLOCK LONDON.

144
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:04,700
HI.

145

A CALL TO MY BOYFRIEND.

150
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:20,400
RIGHT. I DON'T SUPPOSE
THERE'S ANY CHANCE

151
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,400
I COULD TEMPT YOU
AWAY FROM HIM?

152
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:27,900
NOTHING COULD TEMPT ME
AWAY FROM MY BOYFRIEND.

153

SUSAN'S?

177
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,800
 <i>YEAH, YOU KNOW--</i>
 <i>SUSAN'S.</i>

178
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:30,700
 <i>THE BAR.</i>
THE BAR?

179
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:32,800
 <i>YEAH, YOU MAY NOT</i>
 <i>HAVE HEARD OF IT,</i>

180
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:35,400
 <i>IT'S FOR AUSTRALIANS.</i>

181
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:41,900
THERE'S A BAR
FOR AUSTRALIANS
CALLED SUSAN'S?

182
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:43,500
IN LONDON?!

183
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:45,100
 <i>OH, YEAH!</i>

184
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:48,800
 <i>YOU ALWAYS FIND A WHOLE BUNCH</i>
 <i>OF AUSTRALIANS IN SUSAN'S.</i>

185
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:54,600
THIS MUST SEEM
LIKE A STUPID QUESTION,

186
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,700
BUT DOES THIS BAR

187
00:07:56,700 --> 00:08:00,200
HAVE ANYTHING TO DO
WITH SUSAN WALKER?

188
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:02,200
 <i>YOU KNOWSUSAN WALKER?</i>

189
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:14,100
TV:
( gunfire and sirens )

190
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:21,000
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

191
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:24,400
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

192
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:27,000
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

193
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:31,400
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

194
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:35,200
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

195
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,700
( sighs )

196
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:41,800
ALL RIGHT.

197
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:43,500
I'M JUST OFF
TO THE LOO.

198
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:45,300
I DON'T THINK
ANYONE ASKED.

199
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:47,800
OH, SORRY.
NO, UH...

200
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:50,500
IT'S JUST A HABIT.

201
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:52,200
OH.

202
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,800
YOU MUST HAVE A GIRLFRIEND.

203
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:57,600
HELLO.

204
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:00,100
HI.

205
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:01,500
SO, DO YOU?

206
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:02,800
WHAT?

207
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,800
HAVE A GIRLFRIEND?

208
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,800
YOU SAID <i>HELLO?</i>

209
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:11,100
YES, JUST HELLO,
THAT'S ALL.

210
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:12,300
SO WHAT DID YOU TELL HER?

211
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:13,400
TELL HER?

212
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:16,100
WHEN SHE ASKED
IF YOU HAD A GIRLFRIEND.

213
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:19,300
YOU KNOW WHAT'S BRILLIANT
ABOUT HAVING A GIRLFRIEND?

214
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:20,600
JEFF!

215
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:23,200
YOU'VE BEEN GOING OUT
WITH JULIA FOR THREE <i>DAYS.</i>

216
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,400
WE'VE NEVER SEEN YOU
THIS HAPPY.

217
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:29,200
IT WOULD BE A SHAME
IF YOU FORCED US TO KILL YOU.

218
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:32,400
HAVING A GIRLFRIEND
IS LIKE LEGALIZED SEX.

219
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:35,600
JEFF, SEX <i>IS</i> LEGAL.

220
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,800
IT ALWAYS HAS BEEN LEGAL.

221
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:40,100
WHENEVER I HAVE SEX
WITH JULIA,

222
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:42,600
IT'S JUST SO <i>REALISTIC.</i>

223
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:46,400
IT <i>IS</i> ACTUALLY REAL, JEFF.

224
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:48,800
I'VE GOT MY OWN PRIVATE BOTTOM!

225
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,200
WHAT?

226
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:52,300
ANYTIME I WANT TO
SEE A BOTTOM,

227
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:53,800
I JUST ASK JULIA.

228
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:56,000
"THERE'S NOTHING TO WATCH
ON THE TELE TONIGHT, DEAR,

229
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,800
WHY DON'T YOU POP
YOUR ARSE OUT?"

230
00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:01,800
IT'S BAD ENOUGH YOU'RE GOING OUT
WITH MY GIRLFRIEND'S BOSS--

231
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,000
I DON'T WANT DETAILS.

232
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,900
SHE'S MY BOSS, TOO.

233
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:07,300
WHICH IS GREAT, BECAUSE
SOMETIMES WE PLAY THIS GAME--

234
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:09,000
JEFF, NO!

235
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,400
SO...

236
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:12,100
SHE ASKED YOU
IF YOU HAD A GIRLFRIEND,

237
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:13,500
WHAT DID YOU SAY?

238
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:14,900
I SAID YES.

239
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:15,900
GOOD. FINE.

240
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:18,500
OF COURSE I DID.
WHAT ELSE COULD I SAY?

241
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:19,600
GREAT.

242
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:22,300
I-I MAY HAVE
PHRASED IT BADLY.

243
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:26,100
HOW BADLY
CAN YOU PHRASE "YES"?

244
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:27,900
NO.

245
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:32,600
THAT WAS
QUITE BADLY PHRASED.

246
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:33,800
OKAY!

247
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:36,800
I MEANT TO SAY YES,
AND I MISSED BY ONE WORD!

248
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:40,000
I'M SOSORRY
I'M NOT <i>PERFECT.</i>

249
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,900
WHY DIDN'T YOU
JUST TELL HER?

250
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:44,100
I WOULD NEVER
DO THAT TO JULIA.

251
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:46,600
WE HAVE A RELATIONSHIP
BASED ON COMPLETE TRUST.

252
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,900
JEFF, YOU DON'T
HAVE A RELATIONSHIP

253
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:50,700
BASED ON A COMPLETE <i>WEEK.</i>

254
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:52,800
WHAT'S THAT
SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

255
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,600
IT MEANS THAT THERE ARE

256
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:56,100
THREE THINGS
ALL MEN SHOULD KNOW,

257
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:57,600
AND IT'S TIME
YOU DID, TOO--

258
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:00,300
YOU'RE NEVER GONNA BE FAMOUS,
YOU'RE FATTER THAN YOU THINK,

259
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:01,800
AND MOST IMPORTANT OF ALL--

260
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:05,400
THEY DON'T
KEEP WEARING STOCKINGS.

261
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:08,100
JULIA <i>ALWAYS</i>
WEARS STOCKINGS.

262
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:09,800
( snickers )
NO, REALLY.

263
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:12,100
SHE'S ALWAYS WORN THEM.
SHE ALWAYS WILL--SHE TOLD ME.

264
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:14,400
IN FACT, JULIA TOLD ME SHE

265
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:16,600
All:
PREFERS WEARING STOCKINGS.

266
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:19,700
WHAT?

267
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:21,800
STOCKINGS AREN'T REAL, JEFF.

268
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:22,900
THEY'RE A MYTH.

269
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:24,300
STOCKINGS ARE REAL,
I'VE SEEN 'EM.

270
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:26,600
 OH, SURE, THERE ARE
 <i>SOME</i> STOCKINGS OUT THERE,

271
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:30,100
BUT THERE'S WHAT,
TEN PAIRS IN THE WHOLE WORLD?

272
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:31,300
TEN, AT MOST.

273
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:33,700
TEN PAIRS FOR ALL OF THEM.
THEY SHARE THEM OUT.

274
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:36,500
( imitates woman )
OH, JULIA, YOU GOT
A NEW BOYFRIEND?

275
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:38,300
YOUR TURN WITH
THE STOCKINGS,THEN.

276
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:40,300
BUT WE'LL NEED THEM BACK
ON TUESDAY,

277
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:42,800
THERE'S AN ANNIVERSARY
IN NEW ZEALAND.

278
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,500
TUESDAY.

279
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:49,400
THE STOCKINGS WILL GO, JEFF.

280
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:51,100
THEY'LL JUST MELT AWAY.

281
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:52,800
THAT'S NOT TRUE.

282
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,300
OKAY...

283
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:56,400
JULIA'S PANTS--

284
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:59,000
REALLY SMALL?

285
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,700
YEAH, TINY.
REALLY TINY.

286
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:04,700
SOMEWHERE BETWEEN WISPY
AND A TRICK OF THE LIGHT?

287
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:09,000
YOU COULD ACCIDENTLY SWALLOW
THREE WHOLE PAIRS IN ONE GO.

288
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,700
TRUST ME.
HA HA HA!

289
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:16,700
HA HA HA.
GREAT, AREN'T THEY?

290
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:18,600
THEY'RE NOT LIKE
REAL PANTS,

291
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:20,400
THEY'RE LIKE
THE GHOST OF PANTS.

292
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:22,300
JEFF?
YEAH?

293
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:23,700
THEY SPREAD.

294
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:26,200
WHAT?

295
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:28,700
PANTS. THEY SPREAD
AND GROW.

296
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:32,200
EXPERTS CAN DETERMINE
THE AGE OF A RELATIONSHIP

297
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:35,200
FROM PANTS SPREADAGE ALONE.

298
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:39,200
YOU START OFF
WITH THAT SEXY LITTLE THONG...

299
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:42,200
AND ONE DAY YOU'RE
LOOKING AT THE MAKINGS

300
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:44,600
OF A DECENT SIZE TRAMPOLINE.

301
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:46,800
IT'S NOT GONNA BE LIKE THAT
WITH ME AND JULIA.

302
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,200
JEFF, JEFF...

303
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,200
BEFORE YOU KNOW IT,

304
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,600
YOU'LL BE SITTING
ON A SOFA WITH JULIA,

305
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,300
SHE'LL BE WEARING PANTS

306
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:55,300
LARGE ENOUGH
TO COVER SWITZERLAND,

307
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:56,600
AND YOU'LL DISCOVER THAT
YOU'RE UNABLE TO MAKE

308
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:58,400
THE SLIGHTEST MOVEMENT
WITHOUT HER SAYING,

309
00:12:58,400 --> 00:12:59,800
"WHERE ARE YOU GOING?"

310
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:02,300
EVERY TIME--
"WHERE ARE YOU GOING?"

311
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:04,000
SHE WON'T EVEN KNOW
SHE'S SAYING IT.

312
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,300
IT LIKE YOU'VE SET OFF
A MOTION SENSOR.

313
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:08,100
AND THEN, YOU'LL NOTICE
THAT YOUR HOUSE

314
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:10,600
IS COVERED IN SHOES.

315
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:13,800
SHOES. SHOES EVERYWHERE!

316
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:15,700
WHY DO THEY HAVE
SO MANY SHOES?

317
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:18,500
DO THEY HAVE EXTRA FEET
WE DON'T KNOW ABOUT?

318
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:20,200
DID THEY SPROUT ROWS
OF ADDITIONAL FEET

319
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:21,800
WHILE WE'RE ASLEEP

320
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:24,100
AND GALLOP AROUND THE STREETS
AT NIGHT SHOUTING,

321
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:26,600
"WHERE ARE YOU GOING?!"
"WHERE ARE YOU GOING?!"

322
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:30,300
AHEM.

323
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:32,100
SORRY.

324
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,600
DRIFTED A BIT THERE.

325
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:39,700
SO...

326
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:41,900
THIS GIRL YOU CHATTED UP
IN THE BAR--

327
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:43,500
I DIDN'T CHAT HER UP.

328
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:47,000
I'M WITH SUSAN.
I'M VERY HAPPY WITH SUSAN.
I LOVE SUSAN.

329
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,500
SO WHAT HAPPENED
WITH THE GIRL?

330
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:49,800
NOTHING HAPPENED.

331
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:51,600
WE TALKED FOR A BIT,
WE HAD A COUPLE OF DRINKS,

332
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:55,500
EXCHANGED PHONE NUMBERS,
AND WENT OUR SEPARATE WAYS.

333
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:57,200
YOU EXCHANGED
PHONE NUMBERS?!

334
00:13:57,200 --> 00:14:01,000
OH, FINE--
FOCUS ON <i>THAT</i> PART.

335
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,800
YOU GAVE HER
YOUR ACTUAL PHONE NUMBER?

336
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:05,300
I'M A BLOKE.

337
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:07,100
I CAN'T WITHHOLD
MY NUMBER FROM A WOMAN,

338
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:08,900
I HAVEN'T GOT THE SKILLS.

339
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:11,700
YEAH, BUT THIS GIRL,
SHE COULD PHONE AT ANY TIME.

340
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:12,900
I KNOW.

341
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:14,200
WHILE SUSAN'S HERE.
I KNOW.

342
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:16,100
WELL, SUSAN'S HERE
ALL THE TIME--

343
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:17,600
JEFF, PLEASE! I <i>KNOW!</i>

344
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:20,800
STEVE, YOU'RE GONNA
HAVE TO MOVE OUT.

345
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:24,200
OKAY, DID SHE LOOK LIKE
THE TYPE TO PHONE?

346
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:26,900
YEAH, SHE--SHE REALLY
LOOKED THE TYPE.

347
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:29,000
SO, SHE'S GONNA WAIT
FOR YOU TO PHONE

348
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,400
THEN SHE'S GONNA GET <i>RIGHT IN</i>
PHONING YOU.

349
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:32,600
HOW LONG HAS IT BEEN?

350

IT'S HER!
IT'S HER!

352
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:39,300
IT MIGHT BE!

353
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:41,300
TELL HER SHE'S GOT
THE WRONG NUMBER.

354
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:43,100
SHE'LL THINK SHE
WROTE IT DOWN WRONG.

355
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:44,300
IF IT'S HER, I'M GOING
TO DO THIS PROPERLY.

356
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:46,200
I'M AN ADULT,
FOR GOD'S SAKE.

IT'S OKAY.
NO WORRIES.

00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:08,800

00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:27,500
Could be the girl
from the bar.

374
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:29,100
She could be
having a joke.

375
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:30,800

376
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:33,100

00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:41,700
I PUT HER WITH SUSAN,
BUT SHE'S A BIT OF TRICKY ONE.

478

ON THE PHONE.

527
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:25,600
IF SUSAN FINDS OUT,

528
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:28,300
YOU SAY YOU'RE
DICK DARLINGTON.
WHY ME?

529
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:29,700
OKAY. YOU, PATRICK.

530
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:32,300
NO WAY.
ANYONE ELSE WANT A BEER?

531
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:33,300
OH, COME ON.

533
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:36,800
( phone rings )

534
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:38,100

(French accent )
 <i>HELLO.</i>

00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:47,100
IS THAT BRUCE'S BAR AND GRILL?

540
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:52,800
I KNOW THAT IT MUST BE,

00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:56,800
G'DAY...AGAIN.

542

IS THAT THE LOVELY GISELLE?

543
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:02,500
I DO NOT BELIEVE THERE IS

AND I DO NOT BELIEVE

545
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:07,300
THAT THERE IS A BAR
CALLED SUSAN'S.

546
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:08,700
THIS IS A JOKE

547
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:10,700
 <i>AT THE EXPENSE OF MY FRIEND,</i>
 <i>SUSAN WALKER.</i>

548
