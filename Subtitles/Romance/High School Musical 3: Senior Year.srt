Sixteen. There's 16 minutes

00:10:26,725 --> 00:10:29,626
Yeah. I wish it would all just stop.

170
00:10:32,297 --> 00:10:33,958
At least just slow down.

171
00:10:43,442 --> 00:10:47,572
<i># Can you imagine what would happen</i>

172
00:10:47,646 --> 00:10:50,308
<i># If we could have any dream?</i>

173
00:10:52,017 --> 00:10:56,113
<i># I'd wish this moment</i>
<i>was ours to own it</i>

174
00:10:56,188 --> 00:10:59,680
<i># And that it would never leave</i>

175
00:10:59,758 --> 00:11:02,659
<i># Then I would thank that star</i>

176
00:11:02,728 --> 00:11:05,925
<i># That made our wish come true</i>

177
00:11:05,998 --> 00:11:08,296
<i># Oh, yeah</i>

178
00:11:08,367 --> 00:11:11,734
<i># 'Cause he knows that where you are</i>

179
00:11:11,804 --> 00:11:15,740
<i># Is where I should be too</i>

180
00:11:18,410 --> 00:11:21,243
<i># Right here</i>

181
00:11:22,748 --> 00:11:25,979
<i># Right now</i>

182
00:11:26,051 --> 00:11:28,542
- <i># Right now</i>
- <i># I'm looking at you</i>

183
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:31,350
<i># And my heart loves the view</i>

184
00:11:31,423 --> 00:11:35,792
- <i># 'Cause you mean everything</i>
- <i># Everything</i>

185
00:11:35,861 --> 00:11:38,989
<i># Right here</i>

186
00:11:39,064 --> 00:11:42,795
<i># I promise you somehow</i>

00:11:42,868 --> 00:11:44,699
<i># Somehow we're gonna</i>

188
00:11:44,770 --> 00:11:49,173
<i># Tomorrow can wait</i>

189
00:11:49,241 --> 00:11:54,645
<i># To be, but right now</i>

190
00:11:54,713 --> 00:11:57,580
<i># Oh, we know it's coming</i>

191
00:11:57,649 --> 00:11:59,742
<i># And it's coming fast</i>

00:11:59,818 --> 00:12:03,276

<i># Make it last</i>

195
00:12:11,063 --> 00:12:13,657
<i># 'Cause right here</i>

196
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,959
<i># Right now</i>

197
00:12:19,037 --> 00:12:21,130
<i># Yeah, I'm looking at you</i>

<i># You and me #

209
00:13:08,921 --> 00:13:11,617
Is this a pirate's wheel?

210
00:13:11,690 --> 00:13:12,679
No.

211
00:13:13,492 --> 00:13:15,289
[laughs]

212
00:13:16,094 --> 00:13:17,459
Very cute.

213
00:13:17,529 --> 00:13:19,258
I haven't played
with Robo-Rob since third grade.

214
00:13:19,331 --> 00:13:22,425
- I'm Robo-Rob. I am...
- Don't break him. Don't break him.

215
00:13:26,004 --> 00:13:28,029
- That's Chad's.
- Sure it is.

216
00:13:30,809 --> 00:13:33,676
Now it's just like kindergarten.

217
00:13:33,745 --> 00:13:36,009
Troy? You have guests.

218
00:13:36,081 --> 00:13:40,142
Don't make me come up there
and get you again. Hi, Gabriella.

219
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:44,020
We'll be right down, Mom.

220
00:13:46,892 --> 00:13:49,383
She really will come up here
if we don't go down.

221
00:13:49,461 --> 00:13:51,224
Oh, OK.

222
00:14:00,072 --> 00:14:04,839
Right there, right there. OK,
come on through. Come on. There you go.

223
00:14:25,264 --> 00:14:27,425
[sighs]

224
00:14:30,335 --> 00:14:31,324
Wow.

225
00:14:35,607 --> 00:14:37,871
[whistles]

226
00:14:40,712 --> 00:14:42,202
Hey, Troy.

227
00:14:42,281 --> 00:14:44,078
So, when's the big game?

228
00:14:44,149 --> 00:14:45,639
[cell phone rings]

229
00:14:45,717 --> 00:14:47,150
Uh, yesterday.

230
00:14:48,654 --> 00:14:50,315
Oh, well. Good luck.

231
00:14:52,791 --> 00:14:54,918
- Wow.
- She's so sweet.

232
00:14:59,665 --> 00:15:01,257
[boy gasps]

233
00:15:23,021 --> 00:15:25,319
What are you? I mean, who are you?

234
00:15:25,390 --> 00:15:28,791
Good morning, Ms. Evans. I'm Tiara Gold.

235
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:30,851
I transferred
to East High from London

236
00:15:30,929 --> 00:15:34,228
and I noticed on the board you're
in need of a personal assistant.

237
00:15:35,267 --> 00:15:37,201
Yeah, with finals, prom, graduation,

238
00:15:37,269 --> 00:15:40,363
I need someone tracking
my appointments and assignments.

239
00:15:40,439 --> 00:15:43,931
Most important, I need someone
to run lines for the musical.

240
00:15:44,009 --> 00:15:48,742
- That's a theater term for...
- Learning your role. I understand.

241
00:15:48,814 --> 00:15:51,476
It's best to keep
science and math books together,

242
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:54,041
since those are
first lessons of the day.

243
00:15:54,119 --> 00:15:55,984
How do you know my schedule?

244
00:15:56,054 --> 00:15:59,182
I took the liberty of checking,
simply to make certain

245
00:15:59,257 --> 00:16:03,489
I'd have your nonfat, no-foam,
soy latte ready for free period.

246
00:16:03,562 --> 00:16:05,860
- One packet of sweetener?
- Organic.

247
00:16:09,835 --> 00:16:14,135
I'll e-mail you my wardrobe choices each
morning so that our outfits won't clash.

248
00:16:14,206 --> 00:16:16,674
If you own any orange, get rid of it.

249
00:16:19,544 --> 00:16:22,012
By the way, like the accent.

250
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:24,514
It's... sweet.

251
00:16:29,388 --> 00:16:34,291
Troy, my brother.
Can I have your gym locker?

252
00:16:34,359 --> 00:16:36,759
- What?
- Like starting next week.

253
00:16:36,828 --> 00:16:41,094
I'll be running the team next season
and it'll help me out with the guys.

254
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:44,693
- Yeah, why didn't I think of that?
- I don't know.

255
00:16:44,770 --> 00:16:46,260
[school bell rings]

256
00:16:46,338 --> 00:16:48,067
Tardy again. Later, bro!

257
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:50,769
Are you serious?

258
00:16:50,842 --> 00:16:52,833
What about her... Hey.

259
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:58,547
All right, everyone. Settle down.

260
00:16:58,617 --> 00:17:02,314
We are all excited about our Wildcats'

261
00:17:02,387 --> 00:17:06,414
- top-to-bottom championships.
- That would be "back-to-back."

262
00:17:06,491 --> 00:17:10,086
Whatever the case,
it was a grand slam. Well done!

263
00:17:10,162 --> 00:17:13,563
And our student body president
and co-editor of the yearbook,

264
00:17:13,632 --> 00:17:16,567
Taylor McKessie,
has important announcements.

265
00:17:16,635 --> 00:17:20,662
Senior trip committee meets tomorrow
and reports Thursday to prom committee,

266
00:17:20,739 --> 00:17:23,367
headed by Martha.
Pick up your tickets from her.

267
00:17:23,442 --> 00:17:26,969
This year's theme is "The Last Waltz."

268
00:17:27,045 --> 00:17:28,979
But don't be last to pick up tickets.

269
00:17:29,047 --> 00:17:32,983
Graduation committee convenes Monday.
Picture deadline is Thursday

270
00:17:33,051 --> 00:17:36,646
and finals study groups alternate
with all of the above. Questions?

271
00:17:36,721 --> 00:17:39,189
What's the lunch special
in the cafeteria?

272
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:43,824
New York deli. Anyone else?

273
00:17:43,895 --> 00:17:49,424
Moving on. Ms. Sharpay Evans, four-term
president of the drama club,

274
00:17:49,501 --> 00:17:51,230
spring musicale report.

275
00:17:51,303 --> 00:17:54,602
Well, with prom, finals,
everyone is so busy.

276
00:17:54,673 --> 00:17:57,699
I was thinking
I'd select something modest.

277
00:17:57,776 --> 00:18:00,074
Perhaps even a one-woman show.

278
00:18:03,348 --> 00:18:06,283
A little light on the sign-ups, Kelsi?

279
00:18:06,351 --> 00:18:09,445
No. We're actually doing pretty well.

280
00:18:11,156 --> 00:18:14,990
Well, well, well.
Almost the entire homeroom.

281
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:16,527
[Sharpay groans]

282
00:18:16,595 --> 00:18:18,460
How inspiring!

283
00:18:18,530 --> 00:18:22,967
I will happily see all of you
at free period to discuss the show

284
00:18:23,034 --> 00:18:26,162
and to make a very special announcement.

285
00:18:26,238 --> 00:18:29,071
[school bell rings]

286
00:18:30,342 --> 00:18:32,833
[chattering]

287
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:46,122
I'll be retaking my finals two or three
times. I'm moving into the library.

288
00:18:46,191 --> 00:18:48,022
I'm working on my truck every day.

289
00:18:48,093 --> 00:18:50,584
I've got five recipes
for Family Science final.

290
00:18:50,662 --> 00:18:52,630
We've got a yearbook to edit, so no.

291
00:18:52,697 --> 00:18:56,793
Sorry! Jeez. I thought since it was the
last show, everyone would want to do it.

292
00:18:56,868 --> 00:19:00,201
- You're wrong.
- We just don't have time.

293
00:19:00,272 --> 00:19:04,800
Hey. Hey, you guys, listen up.
Kelsi's right. We should do this.

294
00:19:04,876 --> 00:19:07,640
This is our last chance
to do something together.

295
00:19:07,712 --> 00:19:10,306
All of us. Something really fun.

296
00:19:10,382 --> 00:19:11,849
Oh, yippee.

297
00:19:12,918 --> 00:19:15,716
So, what do you say, Wildcats?

298
00:19:15,787 --> 00:19:17,812
No, I still don't think
it's a good idea.

299
00:19:17,889 --> 00:19:21,222
- Guys, come on! It's our senior year!
- Troy.

300
00:19:23,428 --> 00:19:26,989
We're all in this together.
This is our senior year.

301
00:19:27,065 --> 00:19:28,589
I'm in.

302
00:19:30,135 --> 00:19:31,363
What?

303
00:19:31,436 --> 00:19:33,199
- It will be fun.
- Yes!

304
00:19:33,271 --> 00:19:36,240
- Oh, boy.
- How much time will it take?

305
00:19:36,308 --> 00:19:38,674
Yeah. And what the heck
is the show about?

306
00:19:38,743 --> 00:19:40,370
You, Mr. Danforth.

307
00:19:42,047 --> 00:19:43,036
Me?

308
00:19:45,684 --> 00:19:49,279
The spring musicale is all about you.

309
00:19:53,592 --> 00:19:57,289
Hold up. If it's about me, then
can I have my ball back? Please?

310
00:19:58,997 --> 00:20:01,261
- It's about all of you.
- Go!

311
00:20:01,333 --> 00:20:03,130
And all of you will create it.

312
00:20:03,201 --> 00:20:08,639
A show about your final days at
East High. We'll call it <i>Senior Year.</i>

313
00:20:08,707 --> 00:20:10,572
Genius.

314
00:20:10,642 --> 00:20:13,634
Uh-uh-uh! Playing a role is easy,

315
00:20:13,712 --> 00:20:16,476
but being yourself,
now that's a challenge.

316
00:20:16,548 --> 00:20:18,038
Miss Darbus, exactly...

317
00:20:18,116 --> 00:20:20,812
Kelsi will compose,
Ryan will choreograph

318
00:20:20,885 --> 00:20:23,376
- and I will direct.
- Thank you.

319
00:20:23,455 --> 00:20:28,119
Now, I have
some very important news from...

320
00:20:29,628 --> 00:20:32,995
...the Juilliard School
in New York City,

321
00:20:33,064 --> 00:20:36,795
America's preeminent college
for the performing arts.

322
00:20:36,868 --> 00:20:40,395
And for the first time
in East High history,

323
00:20:40,472 --> 00:20:43,805
Juilliard is considering four of you

324
00:20:43,875 --> 00:20:46,605
for one available scholarship.

325
00:20:46,678 --> 00:20:49,704
- Miss Sharpay Evans.
- I'm already packed.

326
00:20:49,781 --> 00:20:52,807
- Mr. Ryan Evans.
- Dance.

327
00:20:52,884 --> 00:20:56,115
- Miss Kelsi Nielsen.
- What? They got my letter?

328
00:20:56,187 --> 00:20:57,711
They certainly did.

329
00:20:57,789 --> 00:21:02,226
And, lastly, Mr. Troy Bolton.

330
00:21:02,293 --> 00:21:04,420
What?

331
00:21:04,496 --> 00:21:09,433
Juilliard will be sending
representatives to observe our show.

332
00:21:11,603 --> 00:21:16,370
So good luck to our four applicants.

333
00:21:16,441 --> 00:21:19,706
Yeah, nice. Nice, guys.
That's pretty funny.

334
00:21:20,945 --> 00:21:23,607
So... who's the big comedian?

335
00:21:23,682 --> 00:21:28,779
- Is there something wrong?
- Yeah. Yeah, I didn't apply.

336
00:21:28,853 --> 00:21:33,381
- I've never heard of Juilliard.
- Well, that may be, Mr. Bolton,

337
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:37,258
but evidently Juilliard
has heard of you.

338
00:21:37,328 --> 00:21:41,094
And as you create this show,
you must dig deep

339
00:21:41,166 --> 00:21:45,569
and think about your aspirations
and dreams for the future.

340
00:21:45,637 --> 00:21:47,400
Line up, downstage, please.

341
00:21:50,975 --> 00:21:54,638
Let's begin with Mr. Danforth.
Step forward, please.

342
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:57,609
Your future.

343
00:21:57,682 --> 00:22:00,810
It's easy. It's U of A.
Hoops all the way.

344
00:22:00,885 --> 00:22:04,685
- Yeah.
- Miss McKessie.

345
00:22:04,756 --> 00:22:07,657
I'm going to be the President
of the United States.

346
00:22:07,726 --> 00:22:08,750
Oh.

347
00:22:08,827 --> 00:22:11,318
I'm going to finish
college first, of course.

348
00:22:12,530 --> 00:22:14,327
Martha Cox, you're late.

349
00:22:14,399 --> 00:22:17,732
I'm sorry, I just thought maybe
we could use a few more dancers.

[group gasps, chuckles]

351

I feel a show coming on already!

352
00:22:35,353 --> 00:22:36,820
Mr. Bolton.

353
00:22:38,123 --> 00:22:40,182
- Mr. Bolton.
- Hmm?

354
00:22:40,258 --> 00:22:43,318
- Your future.
- Oh, yeah, uh...

355
00:22:45,930 --> 00:22:49,798
You know... uh...

356
00:22:49,868 --> 00:22:51,392

357
00:22:55,940 --> 00:22:58,067
Uh...

358
00:22:58,143 --> 00:23:01,601
I think we should stage
the perfect prom.

359
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:05,445
Golly gee, how adorable.
What do I want?

360
00:23:05,517 --> 00:23:08,418
Gosh, I wouldn't know
where to begin.

361
00:23:09,554 --> 00:23:11,613
But I know where it ends.

362
00:23:11,689 --> 00:23:13,281
Center stage.

363
00:23:14,793 --> 00:23:16,454
A single spotlight.

364
00:23:18,863 --> 00:23:22,390
A huge marquee that reads...

365
00:23:36,147 --> 00:23:37,910
New York deli platter, please.

366
00:23:37,982 --> 00:23:41,543
- How can you think about food?
- Maybe because it's lunch time?

367
00:23:41,619 --> 00:23:44,213
No pickles.
Throw that Big Apple parfait in.

368
00:23:44,289 --> 00:23:46,780
OK, this show is our last shot, Ryan.

369
00:23:49,427 --> 00:23:52,885
Sharpay's meal, please.
Thanks. That's great.

370
00:23:52,964 --> 00:23:55,956
Troy pretended
to know nothing about Juilliard.

371
00:23:56,034 --> 00:23:58,559
- Give me a break.
- He seemed surprised to me.

372
00:23:58,636 --> 00:24:02,231
The theater fairy magically
sent in Troy's application?

373
00:24:02,307 --> 00:24:06,334
Performers can't fool me. They're
deceitful, ambitious and ruthless.

374

- Exactly.

Perfect timing, Bolton.

548
00:34:35,206 --> 00:34:38,232
We weren't just given these lockers.
We had to earn them.

549
00:34:38,309 --> 00:34:40,300
Right. Right. Thanks, man.

00:34:42,513 --> 00:34:45,107
- Chad, what's the combo?
- What's the combo?

551
00:34:45,182 --> 00:34:48,242
It's like he said.
You got to earn them.

552
00:34:48,319 --> 00:34:50,150
What's that supposed to mean?

553
00:34:50,221 --> 00:34:52,849
Hey, guys! Come back.
What are you talking about?

00:34:52,923 --> 00:34:56,086

- Give me my clothes!

Look out. Coming through.

563
00:35:21,652 --> 00:35:24,883
Hey, those are new jeans!
I need those back!

564
00:35:27,157 --> 00:35:32,220
Arms, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

565
00:35:32,296 --> 00:35:34,491
You're really stressing me out.

566
00:35:34,565 --> 00:35:37,432
I need to breathe.
And I don't know what Ryan is doing.

567
00:35:37,501 --> 00:35:40,527
He's doing some kind of
yoga Fosse thing.

568
00:35:40,604 --> 00:35:45,007
Two, three, four... What are you doing?
...six, seven, eight.

One, two, three, great,
five, six, seven...

570
00:35:49,647 --> 00:35:51,376
Troy, just give me my clothes!

571
00:35:55,352 --> 00:35:57,547
- Yearbook opportunity.
- Photo op.

572
00:35:59,189 --> 00:36:00,588
Smile!

573
00:36:07,631 --> 00:36:08,928
Wow.

574
00:36:08,999 --> 00:36:12,366
- Hi.
- Bold choice, gentlemen.

575
00:36:12,436 --> 00:36:16,566
We all must have the courage
to discover ourselves.

576
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:18,699
However, at East High,

577
00:36:18,776 --> 00:36:23,873
we will discover ourselves
whilst clothed.

578
00:36:23,948 --> 00:36:27,111
But welcome to our drama club
and our spring musicale.

579
00:36:27,184 --> 00:36:28,981
Yeah, welcome.

580
00:36:31,388 --> 00:36:35,381
The stage crew can use
your help during detention...

581
00:36:35,459 --> 00:36:36,983
...painting sets.

582
00:36:37,761 --> 00:36:39,160
Throw a sheet over them.

583
00:36:40,197 --> 00:36:41,892
Ryan!

584
00:36:41,966 --> 00:36:45,094
OK. All right, guys,
let's go back up to the top.

585
00:36:45,169 --> 00:36:47,899
Jason, why don't you come
down here and help me out.

586
00:36:52,776 --> 00:36:54,767
[engine rumbling]

588

...work in progress.
If my truck falls apart

589
00:36:59,249 --> 00:37:02,082
because I'm spending my time onstage,
it's your fault.

590
00:37:03,988 --> 00:37:07,822
You think I'd be spending any time
at all up there if it wasn't for you?

591
00:37:08,626 --> 00:37:10,685
You know what? I do.

592
00:37:11,962 --> 00:37:13,953
- What?
- You're so good.

593
00:37:15,132 --> 00:37:18,431
I watch you in rehearsals. You love it.

594
00:37:18,502 --> 00:37:20,902
Why is that so hard for you to admit?

595
00:37:21,872 --> 00:37:24,340
It isn't, to you.

596
00:37:24,408 --> 00:37:29,607
But to my dad? To Chad?
Yeah, it's a little hard.

597
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:31,272
It shouldn't be.

598
00:37:34,852 --> 00:37:38,515
They're happy as long as
we're all talking about U of A.

599
00:37:38,589 --> 00:37:44,186
You chose Stanford. U of A
was sort of chosen for me.

600
00:37:44,261 --> 00:37:47,424
I haven't talked
to anybody about this, but...

601
00:37:47,498 --> 00:37:50,262
...I've had offers from other colleges.

602
00:37:52,202 --> 00:37:55,569
- I'm really listening.
- I get it, Troy.

603
00:37:57,307 --> 00:37:59,468
I still have decisions to make, too.

604
00:38:00,778 --> 00:38:02,905
Like what?

605
00:38:02,980 --> 00:38:08,111
I thought I heard you. I was just making
some snacks inside. Are you guys hungry?

606
00:38:11,188 --> 00:38:16,125
- I interrupted something, didn't I?
- Just talking, Mom.

607
00:38:16,193 --> 00:38:19,321
- Homework.
- OK.

608
00:38:22,399 --> 00:38:25,857
Speaking about homework... come on.

609
00:38:25,936 --> 00:38:27,904
I was joking.

610

611
00:38:39,483 --> 00:38:42,281
Compliments of Zeke.
Be careful, they're still hot.

612
00:38:42,352 --> 00:38:44,912
He doesn't know they're gone.
Eat the evidence.

613
00:38:44,988 --> 00:38:48,082
Kissing up to the yearbook editors.
Very smart move.

614
00:38:48,158 --> 00:38:50,558
Chad's hoping for two pages on himself.

615
00:38:50,627 --> 00:38:52,822
Maybe even a third page,
just for his hair.

616
00:38:53,797 --> 00:38:56,391
Hey, what's right is right.

617
00:38:56,467 --> 00:39:00,335
Hoops, by the way, could you take me
after school to check out that tuxedo?

618
00:39:02,206 --> 00:39:04,140
Tuxedo? For what?

619
00:39:05,109 --> 00:39:06,440
For prom.

620
00:39:06,510 --> 00:39:09,411
Honey, if that's
what you call an invitation,

621
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:11,345
you'll be dancing with yourself.

622
00:39:16,887 --> 00:39:19,287

- Yeah.

Mmm.

629
00:39:47,718 --> 00:39:51,984
- OK. I'm going in.
- Go get her.

630
00:39:54,658 --> 00:39:57,559
- Troy, I really just...
- No, we're doing this now.

631
00:39:57,628 --> 00:39:59,619
How long have you been up there?

632
00:39:59,696 --> 00:40:01,323
- Hair's great.
- Don't...

633
00:40:03,467 --> 00:40:05,560
I know. I heard that, too.

634
00:40:05,636 --> 00:40:07,160
- Yes, good.
- Yes. OK.

635
00:40:09,373 --> 00:40:12,137
- Your turn.
- So... Hey.

636
00:40:13,844 --> 00:40:16,472
I was kind of wondering if you'd...

637
00:40:16,547 --> 00:40:18,208
...maybe go with me.

638
00:40:18,282 --> 00:40:22,742
Oh, hey, Chad. They have Tuna Surprise
on the menu. It's good. Really good.

Hey, I'm asking you to prom.

I'm sorry, I can't hear you
because it's so loud.

- Did you hear something?
- No.

- Neither did I.
- Excuse me. Excuse me, everybody.

- Yo!

[Chad] Oh.

Kelsi's writing something amazing

A song, most likely.

- OK.

- Shhh!

00:46:39,162 --> 00:46:43,030
Mr. Zara, since you have become
such a dedicated presence,

754
00:46:43,099 --> 00:46:46,091
I'm making you an understudy. Miss Gold!

755
00:46:48,004 --> 00:46:51,804
- You as well.
- Nice.

756
00:46:51,875 --> 00:46:53,502
I'm in!

I'm playing "The Understudy."

758
00:46:55,979 --> 00:46:57,708
- Congrats.
- Right. What's up?

759
00:46:57,781 --> 00:46:59,772
"Understudy" isn't a role, you moron.

760
00:46:59,849 --> 00:47:02,682
You go on if one of the leads
can't make the performance.

761
00:47:02,752 --> 00:47:06,711
Well, I hate to break it to you, sister,
but you're one, too.

762
00:47:08,124 --> 00:47:10,888
The difference being I can carry a tune.

763
00:47:11,528 --> 00:47:14,656
Listen, I wouldn't sing with you
if my hair was on fire

764
00:47:14,731 --> 00:47:17,199
and you were the last bucket
of water on Earth.

765
00:47:17,267 --> 00:47:19,462
I wouldn't sing with you
if I were starving

766
00:47:19,536 --> 00:47:22,437
and you were
the last pickle at the picnic.

767
00:47:22,505 --> 00:47:24,268
Want to go to lunch sometime?

768
00:47:27,477 --> 00:47:31,208
Gentlemen, start your engines.

769
00:47:31,281 --> 00:47:35,217

Yo, come check out these guitars.

778

But you've already accepted, right?

779
00:48:03,079 --> 00:48:05,639
I'm throwing a going-away party.
This is huge!

780
00:48:05,715 --> 00:48:09,048
You can't get rid of me that easy.
We've got a yearbook to do.

781
00:48:09,119 --> 00:48:10,677
- Back to work.
- OK.

782
00:48:10,754 --> 00:48:14,417
- These are Sharpay's yearbook photos.
- Of course they are. Thank you.

783
00:48:26,703 --> 00:48:29,604
This better be good.
