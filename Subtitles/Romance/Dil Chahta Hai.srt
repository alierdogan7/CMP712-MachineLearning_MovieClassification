1
00:04:08,915 --> 00:04:10,075
l'll check him tomorrow

2
00:04:16,022 --> 00:04:19,253
Mister Sinha, this is a case
of liver cirrhosis

3
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:24,788
The liver is badly damaged.
The patient is under observation

4
00:04:25,531 --> 00:04:26,998
lt's difficult to say anything yet

5
00:04:28,067 --> 00:04:29,864
But, you can do something?

6
00:04:32,338 --> 00:04:36,604
The problem is, we can't do a liver
transplant...on such short notice

7
00:04:42,048 --> 00:04:45,313
lf you wish to inform her
family or relatives...

8
00:04:46,219 --> 00:04:47,652
...you may use my phone

9
00:05:07,373 --> 00:05:12,777
Hey buddy, how are you?
Where are you?

10
00:05:14,814 --> 00:05:16,782
l'm at the hospital

11
00:05:17,483 --> 00:05:19,644
Hospital! Are you okay?

12
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,150
Ya, l'm OK

13
00:05:21,854 --> 00:05:22,479
So, what's wrong then?

14
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:32,131
Just hang in there. l'm coming

15
00:05:32,965 --> 00:05:37,493
By the way, Akash is back in Bombay.
l'll bring him along

16
00:05:40,206 --> 00:05:41,036
He won't come

17
00:05:41,507 --> 00:05:44,032
Don't be silly.Forget what happened

18
00:05:45,111 --> 00:05:46,942
He'll be very happy to
know you're here.

19
00:06:13,573 --> 00:06:14,232
Ya Sameer, tell me

20
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:28,143
Maybe you should go meet him alone.
l don't want to come.

21
00:06:31,958 --> 00:06:33,357
You are right.
Let bygones be bygones...

22
00:06:34,927 --> 00:06:36,326
But what's happening now
isn't wrong either, is it?

23
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:39,092
l am living my life and Sid his

24
00:06:41,501 --> 00:06:42,900
l really think you should
go meet him alone

25
00:07:15,568 --> 00:07:17,968
Sameer, come home quickly.
Now. At once

26
00:07:36,889 --> 00:07:39,858
Sameer! Akash! What's wrong?
What's the rush?

27
00:07:46,532 --> 00:07:47,123
How do you like it?

28
00:07:48,734 --> 00:07:49,666
Have you gone mad?

29
00:07:50,369 --> 00:07:53,429
On the phone you sounded like somebody's
broken into your house!

30
00:07:54,774 --> 00:07:55,706
What do you mean beautiful!?

31
00:08:08,054 --> 00:08:11,956
But Sid...don't you think
she resembles someone?

32
00:08:13,559 --> 00:08:14,048
Resembles whom?

33
00:08:15,728 --> 00:08:17,195
What do you think, Sameer?

34
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:20,155
l think everybody resembles
some one or the other.

35
00:08:22,168 --> 00:08:24,193
But she resembles Miss. Kashyap

36
00:08:25,137 --> 00:08:26,035
Our Economics teacher?

37
00:08:26,405 --> 00:08:28,396
Yes, sir. Our Economics teacher

38
00:08:29,141 --> 00:08:30,039
No man!

39
00:08:31,344 --> 00:08:34,541
Ya man. l know Miss.Kashyap
better than you

40
00:08:37,783 --> 00:08:38,272
Tuitions...

41
00:08:40,186 --> 00:08:40,982
l used to go to her for tuitions

42
00:08:46,859 --> 00:08:49,157
At these tuitions, were there other
students or just the two of you?

43
00:08:49,795 --> 00:08:52,389
What do you think?
- Just the two of you?

44
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:56,259
You are right, Akash

45
00:08:57,103 --> 00:09:01,164
She does resemble Miss.Kashyap.
But guess where l've messed up?

46
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:04,001
You've got her figure wrong

47
00:09:05,311 --> 00:09:06,835
What do you know about her figure?

48
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:56,719
l'm looking for Sid

49
00:09:59,098 --> 00:10:00,565
Sinha... Siddharth Sinha

50
00:10:26,225 --> 00:10:28,216
When did you return to Bombay?
-This morning.

51
00:10:31,697 --> 00:10:32,994
Can't imagine what 'd have
happened if l wasn't here

52
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:35,624
How is she now?

53
00:10:37,069 --> 00:10:40,470
Don't know. lt's hard to say

54
00:10:45,244 --> 00:10:47,542
Tell me about you.
What're you up to these days?

55
00:10:49,949 --> 00:10:52,474
l'm working with Dad in his
computer business

56
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:55,848
Everything else is the same...

57
00:11:01,961 --> 00:11:05,954
And you? Still at your uncle's place
in Poona?

58
00:11:10,036 --> 00:11:13,631
Ya. lt's a very nice.
You must come there sometime

59
00:11:14,373 --> 00:11:14,964
Definitely man

60
00:11:15,941 --> 00:11:17,499
Are you just saying that or
do you really intend on coming?

61
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:22,540
l intend on doing a lot of things
...like getting married

62
00:11:35,327 --> 00:11:38,160
l always knew that the first to ge
married among us three would be you

63
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:42,330
Guess what! So is Akash

64
00:11:43,069 --> 00:11:46,334
What! Akash ! Getting married!?
That's funny

65
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:48,299
l'm not kidding!

66
00:11:50,643 --> 00:11:51,268
No way!

67
00:12:01,087 --> 00:12:03,055
But to whom? That girl who was
crazy about him in college?

68
00:12:04,190 --> 00:12:05,020
Don't you remember her?

69
00:12:05,524 --> 00:12:07,048
She used to say Akash's name
in that peculiar way!

70
00:12:12,865 --> 00:12:14,093
God! Deepa is coming here!

71
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:26,845
Akash, let's dance. lt'll make the
other couples jealous

72
00:12:29,215 --> 00:12:31,149
Sure! Why not! Go ahead.
l'll be right with you

73
00:12:39,859 --> 00:12:41,486
ln three lifetimes from now

74
00:13:02,882 --> 00:13:06,511
Sameer, please get me a drink.
l'm ever so thirsty

75
00:13:07,319 --> 00:13:10,049
And throw in a dance or two with
Deepa while you're at it

76
00:13:22,134 --> 00:13:22,793
What're you sketching?

77
00:13:48,294 --> 00:13:52,822
Priya, isn't Sameer taking too
long to get your drink?

78
00:14:04,643 --> 00:14:07,077
Did somebody just die?
- Yes...you!

79
00:14:07,413 --> 00:14:10,905
Did l send you to get a drink
or chat up other girls!

80
00:14:12,585 --> 00:14:14,576
l'm sure you have something
going on with her

81
00:14:14,887 --> 00:14:19,256
l remember you were never home
when l was away on holiday

82
00:14:22,094 --> 00:14:24,028
You've got it all wrong, Priya

83
00:14:25,497 --> 00:14:26,486
How do you know her?

84
00:14:30,636 --> 00:14:31,261
Did somebody just die?

85
00:14:35,808 --> 00:14:37,605
Who is she?
- l don't know

86
00:14:38,844 --> 00:14:39,674
You must have seen her somewhere!

87
00:14:42,548 --> 00:14:43,810
That l have.
- Where?

88
00:14:45,517 --> 00:14:46,108
She's over there

89
00:15:04,069 --> 00:15:05,366
Priya, do you know her?

90
00:15:06,305 --> 00:15:08,569
Forget it man. She doesn't
seem your type

91
00:15:09,275 --> 00:15:12,369
l don't plan on marrying her!
Big deal about my type

92
00:15:12,678 --> 00:15:14,339
And may l know what your type is?

93
00:15:14,947 --> 00:15:16,915
One who lives her life
and lets me live mine

94
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:19,115
Someone not overtly emotional

95
00:15:19,885 --> 00:15:23,013
Oh, l remember.
You once met such a girl

96
00:15:24,056 --> 00:15:25,455
The affair lasted for two weeks!

97
00:15:25,658 --> 00:15:26,852
That itself was too much

98
00:15:27,393 --> 00:15:28,655
Anyway, l'm off...

99
00:15:29,728 --> 00:15:32,390
...or she'll have had grandchildren
by the time l get there

100
00:15:33,766 --> 00:15:37,224
Think about it.
l don't see her biting the hook

101
00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:43,134
lt's called the good-ole
Akash charm and it never fails

102
00:15:52,551 --> 00:15:54,610
ls the mike leaking., where has 3 gone?

103
00:15:58,657 --> 00:16:02,855
Today, on this all important
graduation day...

104
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:07,156
l have decided to sing a song

105
00:16:17,009 --> 00:16:19,443
And because we are stepping
into a new world...

106
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:24,778
...where the responsibility to be
somebody will be thrust on us...

107
00:16:25,617 --> 00:16:28,745
The title of the song is:
''A hundred ways to get a job''

108
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:37,292
Relax guys! l was only kidding!

109
00:17:02,588 --> 00:17:08,618
lf people say....that we are crazy,
then let them

110
00:17:17,102 --> 00:17:22,768
We don't give a damn
about what they think

111
00:17:24,376 --> 00:17:27,675
When we can play music
When we can sing...

112
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:30,542
Then why should we hesitate?

113
00:17:38,924 --> 00:17:44,453
We will sing the melody
that's in our hearts

114
00:17:46,198 --> 00:17:47,688
lf the world gets angry...
- Let it be angry

115
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:49,333
lf the world quarrels...
- Let it quarrel

116
00:17:49,735 --> 00:17:51,430
lf the world fights...
-Just it fight.

117
00:17:51,703 --> 00:17:53,193
Just keep right on singing

118
00:17:53,405 --> 00:17:55,066
lf the world sulks...
- Let it sulk

119
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:56,869
lf ties are broken...
- Let them break

120
00:17:57,142 --> 00:17:58,609
lf someone leaves you...
- Let them go

121
00:17:58,811 --> 00:18:00,472
Don't ever be afraid
We are today.

122
00:18:00,679 --> 00:18:05,946
Why should our style be old?

123
00:18:30,008 --> 00:18:35,913
There's lightning in our eyes.
A storm in our breath

124
00:18:37,149 --> 00:18:43,349
What's fear, what's defeat?
We don't know what they mean

125
00:18:44,323 --> 00:18:50,853
The earth and sky,
are created for us

126
00:18:51,463 --> 00:18:57,732
l'm sure we could even
pluck the stars out of the night

127
00:18:58,871 --> 00:19:04,503
Our abode is beyond the sky

128
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:11,845
We are today.
Why should our style be old?

129
00:19:42,748 --> 00:19:48,653
We have been raised in the
land of dreams

130
00:19:49,888 --> 00:19:56,157
We can be as shy as
we are openly affectionate

131
00:19:56,895 --> 00:20:03,664
Mesmerising everybody
wherever we go...

132
00:20:04,236 --> 00:20:10,835
...teaching you lovely women
the art of love

133
00:20:11,843 --> 00:20:17,179
We know how to steal
a woman's heart and her sleep

134
00:20:18,917 --> 00:20:24,856
We are today.
Why should our style be old?

135
00:20:26,325 --> 00:20:32,594
lf people say...
...that we are crazy, then let them

136
00:20:40,839 --> 00:20:46,209
We don't give a damn
about what they think

137
00:20:47,879 --> 00:20:51,474
When we can play music
When we can sing...

138
00:20:51,683 --> 00:20:54,208
Then why should we hesitate?

139
00:21:02,561 --> 00:21:08,830
We will sing the melody
that's in our hearts

140
00:21:10,202 --> 00:21:11,669
lf the world gets angry...
- Let it be angry

141
00:21:11,870 --> 00:21:13,531
lf the world quarrels..
- Let it quarrel

142
00:21:13,739 --> 00:21:15,366
lf the world fights...
- Let it fight

143
00:21:15,574 --> 00:21:17,166
Just keep right on singing

144
00:21:17,376 --> 00:21:19,173
lf the world sulks...
- Let it sulk

145
00:21:19,378 --> 00:21:20,845
lf ties are broken...
- Let them break

146
00:21:21,046 --> 00:21:22,604
lf someone leaves you...
- Let them go

147
00:21:22,814 --> 00:21:24,509
Don't ever be afraid

148
00:21:24,716 --> 00:21:30,177
We are today.
Why should our style be old?

149
00:22:37,222 --> 00:22:39,247
Shalini...that's a lovely name

150
00:22:42,027 --> 00:22:44,655
l haven't seen you before.
You're not from our college

151
00:22:45,764 --> 00:22:47,493
You're right. l'm here with somebody

152
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:51,501
And now would you say yes to
dancing with this somebody?

153
00:22:53,839 --> 00:22:54,737
The fact is that Rohit...

154
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:57,465
Rohit! Okay!
So you are Rohit's sister?

155
00:22:58,076 --> 00:22:59,168
No. Actually l...

156
00:23:00,345 --> 00:23:05,112
Rohit and l are very good friends.
Why, he's more like a brother

157
00:23:10,822 --> 00:23:15,521
Not even if l told you
that l love you?

158
00:23:18,663 --> 00:23:21,632
Yes, Shalini. l love you
and only you

159
00:23:22,267 --> 00:23:23,063
My every breath...

160
00:23:23,935 --> 00:23:24,697
...every heartbeat...

161
00:23:25,670 --> 00:23:28,161
...every moment,
is for you, Shalini

162
00:23:29,341 --> 00:23:32,777
l'm sure that l was born
so that l could love you

163
00:23:33,412 --> 00:23:36,210
And you were born to become mine

164
00:23:36,715 --> 00:23:37,682
You are mine, Shalini

165
00:23:38,550 --> 00:23:39,847
And if you ask your heart...

166
00:23:40,819 --> 00:23:43,617
...you will know that l speak
the truth.

167
00:24:00,906 --> 00:24:01,395
Who are you?

168
00:24:02,307 --> 00:24:03,774
Don't you recognize your brother Rohit?

169
00:24:07,312 --> 00:24:11,078
You are Rohit? l mean,
you too are Rohit?

170
00:24:12,884 --> 00:24:15,045
l thought Shalini was that
other Rohit's sister.

171
00:24:16,121 --> 00:24:17,247
Look, he's over there

172
00:24:27,899 --> 00:24:30,925
Sameer...! Your name is Sameer?

173
00:24:31,770 --> 00:24:35,831
So you've being lying to me all along!
That's really wrong of you

174
00:24:39,611 --> 00:24:41,476
What can l say now...
You can see for yourself

175
00:24:42,013 --> 00:24:44,208
He got me to believe that
his name was Rohit

176
00:24:45,050 --> 00:24:48,383
Neither is he Rohit
nor Shalini my sister

177
00:24:49,988 --> 00:24:51,285
Shalini is my fiancee

178
00:24:53,825 --> 00:24:54,416
Fiancee...!

179
00:24:59,364 --> 00:25:01,298
l don't like you being friends
with Akash at all

180
00:25:02,667 --> 00:25:06,433
His behaviour the other night...
You know how embarrassed l was?

181
00:25:07,906 --> 00:25:08,930
Let him do what he wants.

182
00:25:09,608 --> 00:25:10,336
Just keep away from him

183
00:25:12,344 --> 00:25:13,811
But Akash is my friend, Priya!

184
00:25:14,346 --> 00:25:16,871
Like you don't have
any other friends?

185
00:25:18,550 --> 00:25:19,312
Yes, l do...But he...

186
00:25:19,518 --> 00:25:23,284
Just decide, Sameer. You can
either be with Akash or me!

187
00:25:30,095 --> 00:25:30,652
l am thinking...

188
00:25:31,496 --> 00:25:34,158
You need time to think
if you want to be with me!

189
00:25:37,802 --> 00:25:39,565
Okay. So you want some time?

190
00:25:39,871 --> 00:25:40,337
No!

191
00:25:43,475 --> 00:25:46,205
l'm going out with friends.
l'll be back by 2.00

192
00:25:47,045 --> 00:25:51,448
lf l don't hear from you before that,
l'll know what your answer is

193
00:25:56,221 --> 00:25:58,382
Don't you think you are
over-reacting?

194
00:26:00,892 --> 00:26:01,381
No

195
00:26:02,527 --> 00:26:07,988
You've never seen me over-react.
lf l do...then God help you!!

196
00:26:30,589 --> 00:26:31,146
What are you doing!

197
00:26:32,057 --> 00:26:36,585
Your bruise has turned a strange colour.
Have you seen it, Sid?

198
00:26:37,262 --> 00:26:38,854
l'm glad you like it!
Do you want one?

199
00:26:39,397 --> 00:26:42,992
Hey! Don't get that anger out on me man

200
00:26:43,301 --> 00:26:45,098
Did l ask you to speak to Shalini?

201
00:26:45,303 --> 00:26:50,366
No. But you could've at least helped me.
You just sat there!

202
00:26:50,909 --> 00:26:54,470
Such a true friend! l think l'd be
better off befriending Rohit

203
00:26:54,579 --> 00:26:55,841
l'd at least get some protection!

204
00:26:58,650 --> 00:27:00,845
May God bless your unity. l'm off.

205
00:27:01,386 --> 00:27:03,513
Where to?-Home.

206
00:27:04,022 --> 00:27:05,751
Why? What's the hurry?
Right, Sameer?

207
00:27:06,024 --> 00:27:08,185
Ya, man, chill. lt's only
1O' clock

208
00:27:09,794 --> 00:27:11,955
ln which country?
lt's nearly 4 here!

209
00:27:30,582 --> 00:27:31,913
l forgot to call Priya!

210
00:27:35,854 --> 00:27:37,151
Why are you so scared of Priya?

211
00:27:37,522 --> 00:27:38,511
l'm not scared of her

212
00:27:39,457 --> 00:27:42,221
l don't want to hurt her
or lose her

213
00:27:42,894 --> 00:27:46,295
Sameer, l can't understand
how you tolerate her

214
00:27:46,665 --> 00:27:48,155
She seems more a boss
than a girlfriend!

215
00:27:49,434 --> 00:27:53,302
Akash, l'm asking for help,
not your expert comments

216
00:27:53,505 --> 00:27:54,130
What should l do?

217
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:56,168
What do you think?

218
00:27:57,042 --> 00:27:59,636
l'll tell you what.
Call Priya and apologise

219
00:28:00,178 --> 00:28:02,305
Tell her you will never meet
Akash again

220
00:28:03,782 --> 00:28:04,840
You know l won't do that!

221
00:28:05,216 --> 00:28:07,411
What if she gets hurt...
What if you lose her!

222
00:28:10,422 --> 00:28:11,354
You'll never improve, will you

223
00:28:13,992 --> 00:28:16,051
Why are you turning this
into such an issue?

224
00:28:20,098 --> 00:28:22,328
Just call her, talk to her.
lt'll all be okay

225
00:28:45,523 --> 00:28:50,756
The thing is...but listen...You're not
...but l...what l'm saying...

226
00:28:52,464 --> 00:28:53,453
l'm at Akash's

227
00:28:59,037 --> 00:28:59,731
She hung up

228
00:29:00,972 --> 00:29:01,597
What did you expect?

229
00:29:02,373 --> 00:29:03,533
She'll say Sorry darling!

230
00:29:05,777 --> 00:29:08,109
Enough is enough, Sameer.
Listen to me

231
00:29:08,313 --> 00:29:10,577
Just go there and tell her
these tantrums won't work

232
00:29:11,015 --> 00:29:14,178
lf she wants to be with you,
she must follow your wishes

233
00:29:14,986 --> 00:29:16,317
She's challenged your
self-respect, buddy

234
00:29:16,588 --> 00:29:18,249
What are you doing? Be a man!

235
00:29:26,297 --> 00:29:28,288
That's exactly what l'm going to do.
- That's the way to go!

236
00:29:40,545 --> 00:29:41,409
He's dead!

237
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:51,145
Oh, Priya?
- Please give Sameer the phone

238
00:29:51,556 --> 00:29:53,990
But Sameer hasn't come here. l too am
looking for him since last night

239
00:29:54,192 --> 00:29:55,454
What? Didn't he come there?

240
00:29:57,829 --> 00:29:59,524
Careful man!
Only this eye is working

241
00:30:13,845 --> 00:30:14,869
We need to talk

242
00:30:15,180 --> 00:30:17,546
There's no need for that. l know
what you have to say

243
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:19,412
You know?- Yes

244
00:30:20,418 --> 00:30:22,318
l spoke to Akash after our talk

245
00:30:23,154 --> 00:30:23,711
Right! And?

246
00:30:24,422 --> 00:30:26,447
He said you weren't at his house

247
00:30:27,625 --> 00:30:30,651
Stop pretending! l can't believe
l did this to myself

248
00:30:31,029 --> 00:30:32,860
l never knew you were such a liar

249
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:37,393
l don't want to see your
face ever again!

250
00:31:11,002 --> 00:31:12,094
Could l be of any assistance?

251
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:17,071
lt's not a problem at all

252
00:32:02,553 --> 00:32:04,145
Oh God ! What's in here?
- My things

253
00:32:04,622 --> 00:32:06,021
Hang on. l'll get it from this side

254
00:32:31,916 --> 00:32:35,374
lf just one suitcase has reduced
us to this condition, then...

255
00:32:35,787 --> 00:32:37,311
There's only two more like this

256
00:32:38,122 --> 00:32:40,682
ls that all? Just two more?
Let's go

257
00:33:04,349 --> 00:33:04,974
lt's a nice house

258
00:33:11,055 --> 00:33:13,683
lt belongs to the company l work for

259
00:33:16,894 --> 00:33:19,624
l am an interior designer...
Tara Jaiswal

260
00:33:25,269 --> 00:33:26,065
What do you do?

261
00:33:28,206 --> 00:33:29,867
l work as a porter on Sundays

262
00:33:32,377 --> 00:33:33,435
And the rest of the week?

263
00:33:34,278 --> 00:33:36,974
Normally if anyone asks me that, l say
anything that pops into my head

264
00:33:38,016 --> 00:33:41,213
But l'll tell you the truth because
l think it might be of interest to you

265
00:33:42,653 --> 00:33:43,312
l don't quite understand?

266
00:33:43,755 --> 00:33:47,213
l mean you have three paintings in your
luggage and that's my vocation

267
00:33:53,998 --> 00:33:55,431
May l see your paintings?

268
00:33:56,868 --> 00:33:57,425
Of course

269
00:33:58,870 --> 00:33:59,461
Where do you live?

270
00:34:00,438 --> 00:34:04,033
The last house down this road.
You can come whenever you wish

271
00:34:07,745 --> 00:34:10,680
Sid, l'm going to the office.
- Just a minute, Ma

272
00:34:12,150 --> 00:34:15,745
l'm coming along. Just drop me off
at Sameer's

273
00:34:18,890 --> 00:34:21,723
By the way, it's Anju's wedding
anniversary today

274
00:34:22,293 --> 00:34:23,817
She'll be very disappointed
if you don't come

275
00:34:31,536 --> 00:34:33,401
ls Siddharth home?- Yes

276
00:34:34,739 --> 00:34:36,798
You are...?- l am Tara

277
00:34:41,813 --> 00:34:42,837
Ma, this is Tara

278
00:34:46,818 --> 00:34:47,876
Well, l'd better be going

279
00:34:48,853 --> 00:34:50,480
Ya, you go ahead, l'll go myself.

280
00:34:50,955 --> 00:34:52,513
All right. But you are coming
this evening, aren't you?

281
00:34:53,291 --> 00:34:55,316
Where?- To Anju's!

282
00:34:57,328 --> 00:34:58,488
Mom, l get extremely bored there

283
00:35:00,465 --> 00:35:03,059
There are very few places in this world
where you don't get bored

284
00:35:03,601 --> 00:35:04,966
Fine ! Have it your way.

285
00:35:11,109 --> 00:35:11,905
Please have a seat

286
00:35:13,978 --> 00:35:15,172
l'd like to see your paintings first

287
00:35:54,485 --> 00:35:55,543
The same theme here too

288
00:35:58,289 --> 00:35:58,721
What theme?

289
00:36:01,359 --> 00:36:03,122
l have learnt something about
you today

290
00:36:06,564 --> 00:36:10,364
Something l couldn't see
at our first meeting

291
00:36:12,803 --> 00:36:13,292
What's that?

292
00:36:18,142 --> 00:36:20,940
The thing is, you meet people,
talk to them, laugh...

293
00:36:22,346 --> 00:36:24,837
But there's a world within you...

294
00:36:26,217 --> 00:36:28,242
...full of dreams, of fantasies...

295
00:36:30,288 --> 00:36:33,280
...that you don't share with anyone

296
00:36:36,327 --> 00:36:40,286
l wonder if those, who claim
to know you...

297
00:36:42,366 --> 00:36:43,355
... really know you at all

298
00:36:47,805 --> 00:36:48,772
What makes you say that?

299
00:36:53,611 --> 00:36:56,478
The door is not open...
Entry is forbidden...

300
00:36:57,281 --> 00:37:00,478
The box is tightly bound...
No one can steal anything...

301
00:37:02,987 --> 00:37:07,321
And who can tell what feelings reflect
behind those shut eyelids...

302
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:13,956
l wonder what other secrets your
paintings hide within them...

303
00:37:17,835 --> 00:37:19,302
Or within you perhaps

304
00:37:23,507 --> 00:37:24,269
Why are you looking at me
like that?

305
00:37:26,844 --> 00:37:28,641
Anyway, which do you think
is your best?

306
00:37:32,016 --> 00:37:33,074
l have yet to create that one

307
00:38:17,361 --> 00:38:19,852
Look at your face!
White as a sheet!

308
00:38:22,533 --> 00:38:25,001
Look, l am very angry right now
and all because of you

309
00:38:25,536 --> 00:38:28,334
Hey! l saved your life and
you are angry with me?

310
00:38:28,773 --> 00:38:30,297
Saved my life?
- Absolutely!

311
00:38:30,941 --> 00:38:31,999
This was bound to happen

312
00:38:32,476 --> 00:38:34,876
Priya would've left you tomorrow
if not today. Know why?

313
00:38:35,513 --> 00:38:38,710
Because she didn't love you,
she loved some other Sameer

314
00:38:39,250 --> 00:38:41,616
He looked like you but was
someone else

315
00:38:42,186 --> 00:38:45,553
You are not that Sameer. You are the
Sameer l know, Sid knows...

316
00:38:46,157 --> 00:38:48,182
And Priya could only hope to know

317
00:38:49,093 --> 00:38:52,062
lf you became that Sameer, our this
Sameer would be defeated!

318
00:38:54,365 --> 00:38:56,595
l never thought of it like that..
- l know

319
00:39:00,071 --> 00:39:01,436
Then pack your bags and let's go

320
00:39:01,872 --> 00:39:03,271
Sid and l are waiting for you
in the car

321
00:39:03,541 --> 00:39:05,008
Where are we going?- Goa!

322
00:39:05,609 --> 00:39:06,234
Goa...?!

323
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:16,978
The heart wants...

324
00:39:20,524 --> 00:39:21,513
The heart wants...

325
00:39:27,665 --> 00:39:30,759
May these sparkling days never end

326
00:39:34,305 --> 00:39:35,272
The heart wants...

327
00:39:36,941 --> 00:39:40,001
May we never have to be
without our friends

328
00:39:43,614 --> 00:39:47,106
May our days be full of poetry...

329
00:39:48,152 --> 00:39:51,588
...our evenings dance and
nights sing.

330
00:39:53,057 --> 00:39:58,256
May our time together always
be fun and exciting

331
00:40:02,366 --> 00:40:08,930
May every path we tread
bring us happiness

332
00:40:11,275 --> 00:40:12,264
The heart wants...

333
00:40:13,844 --> 00:40:17,041
May these sparkling days
never end

334
00:40:20,484 --> 00:40:21,610
The heart wants...

335
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:26,112
May we never have to be
without our friends

336
00:40:29,827 --> 00:40:33,228
Our paths dazzle with their glitter

337
00:40:34,265 --> 00:40:37,632
May this joy and light
be ours by right

338
00:41:52,109 --> 00:41:53,133
Where's Akash?

339
00:41:56,347 --> 00:41:57,245
There...behind the plant

340
00:42:02,453 --> 00:42:03,750
Are you guys staying here too?

341
00:42:03,954 --> 00:42:06,855
Not are...we were.
We are checking out

342
00:42:11,128 --> 00:42:13,596
We've been staying here for a week.
lsn't that right, guys?

343
00:42:14,632 --> 00:42:15,860
Yes, we've been here for a week

344
00:42:16,534 --> 00:42:18,195
But Akash just got here today.
- Yes. l got here today

345
00:42:18,969 --> 00:42:21,403
Akash! lt's nice to see you haven't
lost your sense of humour!

346
00:43:38,315 --> 00:43:40,374
Hey Sid, look over there!

347
00:43:55,466 --> 00:43:58,902
Sid, did you hear that?
Someone's calling out my name

348
00:44:07,645 --> 00:44:14,551
Go faster, buddy. Faster
This is the top speed

349
00:44:52,356 --> 00:44:53,254
What an amazing place!

350
00:45:01,365 --> 00:45:03,833
We should come to Goa every year,
for a week at least

351
00:45:07,237 --> 00:45:07,760
What say, Sid?

352
00:45:12,943 --> 00:45:13,602
What are you thinking?

353
00:45:16,313 --> 00:45:17,507
l'm looking at that ship...

354
00:45:18,749 --> 00:45:20,216
...that's about to disappear over
the horizon

355
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:24,312
The three of us are like that ship

356
00:45:26,457 --> 00:45:28,982
Soon, we'll set out looking
for our destinations....

357
00:45:31,562 --> 00:45:34,497
...and it might just be that
our destinations are different

358
00:45:41,672 --> 00:45:43,230
l don't understand why
you're saying all this

359
00:45:44,875 --> 00:45:45,807
Sid, we are all friends...

360
00:45:48,512 --> 00:45:49,240
...for life

361
00:45:49,446 --> 00:45:50,310
Of course we are

362
00:45:50,814 --> 00:45:53,078
But who knows where life will
take each one of us

363
00:45:55,219 --> 00:45:58,347
Ever wondered, let alone come
here every year for a week...

364
00:45:59,223 --> 00:46:00,952
lt may be difficult to meet
even once in 10 years

365
00:46:06,563 --> 00:46:07,393
That won't happen, Sid

366
00:46:10,234 --> 00:46:15,262
We were, are and will be friends.
Always

367
00:46:19,143 --> 00:46:22,374
Anyway, shall we go?
Deepa must be waiting for you

368
00:46:23,881 --> 00:46:26,509
Don't say must be waiting.
She is!

369
00:46:28,385 --> 00:46:32,344
l told her Akash will meet her
by the poolside at 8 sharp!

370
00:46:39,696 --> 00:46:42,961
How strange is this journey!

371
00:46:43,367 --> 00:46:48,100
lf you just think...
Each one of us is so unaware...

372
00:46:48,739 --> 00:46:52,197
...of where he is destined to go...

373
00:46:52,442 --> 00:46:58,039
...of what the future
holds for each of us

374
00:47:16,366 --> 00:47:17,560
The heart wants...

375
00:47:19,102 --> 00:47:22,230
May these sparkling days never end

376
00:47:25,576 --> 00:47:26,702
The heart wants...

377
00:47:28,278 --> 00:47:31,475
May we never have to be
without our friends

378
00:47:34,985 --> 00:47:38,386
May our days be full of poetry...

379
00:47:39,489 --> 00:47:42,856
...our evenings dance
and nights sing

380
00:47:44,461 --> 00:47:49,831
May our time together always
be fun and exciting

381
00:47:53,737 --> 00:48:00,836
May every path we tread
bring us happiness

382
00:48:02,613 --> 00:48:06,049
Our paths dazzle with their glitter

383
00:48:07,184 --> 00:48:10,551
May this joy and light
be ours by right

384
00:49:13,884 --> 00:49:17,320
Deepa, why do you like Akash
so much?

385
00:49:18,522 --> 00:49:19,011
What do you mean?

386
00:49:24,194 --> 00:49:26,128
Sometimes l wonder why we
like and want someone

387
00:49:28,131 --> 00:49:28,790
Why do you like him?

388
00:49:31,201 --> 00:49:34,534
l don't know... l just do

389
00:49:39,309 --> 00:49:42,073
Even knowing that Akash...
- ...doesn't love me

390
00:49:43,747 --> 00:49:45,715
Yes...then too

391
00:49:54,424 --> 00:49:56,221
Deepa you are a good-looking,
intelligent girl.

392
00:49:57,794 --> 00:49:58,920
You can get anyone you want...

393
00:49:59,129 --> 00:50:02,326
ln that case, why can't
l have Akash!

394
00:50:07,771 --> 00:50:08,499
l don't know that...

395
00:50:11,074 --> 00:50:14,532
But l do know that if
you're ever in trouble,

396
00:50:15,579 --> 00:50:17,570
And need Akash's help or support,
he'll do whatever he can for you.

397
00:50:19,616 --> 00:50:21,447
But Deepa, you shouldn't
hope for things that...

398
00:50:31,395 --> 00:50:32,191
Take a look at this sand

399
00:50:34,097 --> 00:50:35,928
The tighter you try to grip it...

400
00:50:37,034 --> 00:50:38,626
...the faster it slips
through your fingers

401
00:51:13,537 --> 00:51:16,335
Have you donated your bag
to the hotel?

402
00:51:16,973 --> 00:51:19,771
Actually, l've decided to
stay back for a few days

403
00:51:21,078 --> 00:51:21,544
What?

404
00:51:22,279 --> 00:51:24,042
Er...Kristine wants me to stay
for some more time

405
00:51:25,916 --> 00:51:27,713
Kristine?...that girl who...

406
00:51:29,586 --> 00:51:32,919
Sid! Are you listening? Our friend has
decided to become a hippie!

407
00:51:41,398 --> 00:51:44,367
lf you hadn't brought me here,
l'd have never met her

408
00:51:46,470 --> 00:51:50,770
She's Swiss. l was wondering...
why not go there...

409
00:51:51,675 --> 00:51:55,304
...and start a bee farm.
Swiss honey is world famous...

410
00:52:09,159 --> 00:52:09,750
Let's go Akash

411
00:52:17,501 --> 00:52:20,299
What have l done! He was
better off with Priya

412
00:52:20,804 --> 00:52:21,771
One more thing...

413
00:52:23,206 --> 00:52:25,936
Please don't call my house
till l get back

414
00:52:51,568 --> 00:52:54,002
So, did you have fun in Goa?

415
00:52:56,139 --> 00:52:59,336
lt was great. Have you been there?

416
00:53:00,076 --> 00:53:02,271
Yes. Many years ago

417
00:53:10,520 --> 00:53:11,316
Whose photographs are these?

418
00:53:14,424 --> 00:53:15,948
Esha...my daughter

419
00:53:17,427 --> 00:53:20,885
Oh, l haven't met her.
Where is she?

420
00:53:23,633 --> 00:53:25,498
She lives with her father

421
00:53:31,308 --> 00:53:35,802
9th April 95...exactly
on my birthday...

422
00:53:37,314 --> 00:53:38,781
My husband gave me a gift...

423
00:53:53,563 --> 00:53:54,928
You do meet your daughter,
don't you?

424
00:53:57,067 --> 00:53:57,556
No

425
00:54:00,370 --> 00:54:03,032
The Court doesn't permit me
to meet my daughter

426
00:54:04,507 --> 00:54:05,337
Why?

427
00:54:07,244 --> 00:54:09,235
My ex-husband is a very rich man

428
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:12,471
His lawyers were very smart and
capable

429
00:54:14,851 --> 00:54:18,719
With the help of many false
witnesses, he proved...

430
00:54:22,292 --> 00:54:25,750
...that l am not a good mother.
That l'm an alcoholic

431
00:54:28,632 --> 00:54:31,396
An irresponsible woman
who drinks

432
00:54:34,437 --> 00:54:35,426
You're nothing like that!

433
00:54:39,442 --> 00:54:41,239
Oh for you to have been
the judge!

434
00:54:44,781 --> 00:54:47,079
Anyway, what else
did you do there?

435
00:54:50,954 --> 00:54:52,421
l'd like to paint you

436
00:54:59,829 --> 00:55:01,091
Paint me?

437
00:55:11,941 --> 00:55:12,635
Be back in two minutes

438
00:55:58,988 --> 00:55:59,613
Are you going somewhere?

439
00:56:00,390 --> 00:56:01,482
Sorry, l have to go

440
00:56:02,525 --> 00:56:05,517
l just got a call from the site.
There's a problem

441
00:56:43,666 --> 00:56:45,657
Have you given any thought
to your future?

442
00:56:48,405 --> 00:56:49,030
No

443
00:56:51,908 --> 00:56:52,738
l know it's my fault...

444
00:56:54,511 --> 00:56:57,878
...l always thought, l'd give
you some time...You needed it.

445
00:56:59,682 --> 00:57:01,411
lt's my pampering that
has spoilt you

446
00:57:03,286 --> 00:57:04,048
lf this goes on...

447
00:57:04,254 --> 00:57:07,280
You'll definitely have signed
a cheque till my retirement

448
00:57:08,091 --> 00:57:11,390
Dad, there are more things
to life than signing cheques

449
00:57:11,761 --> 00:57:15,424
Really! And what are these things?

450
00:57:17,634 --> 00:57:20,159
l don't know yet but the moment
l do, you'll be the first to know

451
00:57:24,707 --> 00:57:25,639
l have had enough of your jokes

452
00:57:27,577 --> 00:57:30,068
l've decided that you will go
to Australia

453
00:57:31,114 --> 00:57:32,206
Cool! Another holiday?

454
00:57:33,249 --> 00:57:34,841
You'll manage our business
there

455
00:57:36,252 --> 00:57:38,345
Mom, Dad's joking now

456
00:57:38,822 --> 00:57:42,189
No, Akash. Dad is serious
and you better be serious too

457
00:57:44,127 --> 00:57:44,957
You are going to Sydney

458
00:57:46,563 --> 00:57:49,430
And you will manage the office there

459
00:58:03,580 --> 00:58:04,569
Sameerji's Mummyji is on the phone

460
00:58:08,318 --> 00:58:09,182
Akash Baba says that...

461
00:58:12,322 --> 00:58:12,811
Yes, Aunty

462
00:58:13,089 --> 00:58:14,852
What's wrong with Sameer?

463
00:58:15,258 --> 00:58:17,453
Nothing's wrong with Sameer.
He's perfectly OK

464
00:58:17,660 --> 00:58:19,457
What OK!? He's shut himself
in his room

465
00:58:19,662 --> 00:58:22,028
He hasn't eaten and just
doesn't come out

466
00:58:22,999 --> 00:58:23,693
Sameer is in Bombay?

467
00:58:24,734 --> 00:58:25,962
Didn't you all come back
last night

468
00:58:26,769 --> 00:58:30,728
Yes, Aunty. lt was last night
but...l'm so distracted now...

469
00:58:31,040 --> 00:58:32,871
Akash, are you and Sameer on drugs?

470
00:58:33,176 --> 00:58:36,839
Of course not, Aunty. Don't worry.
l'll be there right away

471
00:58:47,323 --> 00:58:48,585
The least you could've done was call.

472
00:58:48,791 --> 00:58:49,723
l didn't know what to say to your Mom

473
00:59:02,539 --> 00:59:03,471
What's happened to you?

474
00:59:04,140 --> 00:59:05,835
l'm in no mood to talk now

475
00:59:10,713 --> 00:59:13,113
Okay. How's Kristine?

476
00:59:13,316 --> 00:59:14,510
Don't even mention her name
in front of me!

477
00:59:16,286 --> 00:59:16,843
Why? What happened?

478
00:59:24,527 --> 00:59:25,255
Get it off your chest

479
00:59:25,929 --> 00:59:28,864
lt's not good for health
to suppress such emotions

480
00:59:33,069 --> 00:59:37,938
Well, after the two of left
the other day...

481
00:59:39,409 --> 00:59:41,036
l met Kristine on the beach

482
00:59:45,248 --> 00:59:46,374
lt felt so good...

483
00:59:47,016 --> 00:59:49,109
Just Kristine and me...

484
00:59:54,691 --> 00:59:55,919
l loved her so much...

485
00:59:58,428 --> 00:59:59,224
How happy l was...

486
01:00:26,956 --> 01:00:29,481
We watched the sunset and she
came back to the hotel with me

487
01:00:33,529 --> 01:00:34,757
l invited her in

488
01:00:36,799 --> 01:00:39,427
l could never have imagined
what happened next

489
01:01:29,852 --> 01:01:31,752
l don't think she was from
Switzerland either

490
01:01:35,391 --> 01:01:36,289
l'm glad to have amused you guys!

491
01:01:37,060 --> 01:01:40,154
That truck driver who gave me a ride
to Bombay was far more sympathetic!

492
01:01:40,730 --> 01:01:42,061
You came back in a truck!?

493
01:01:42,365 --> 01:01:44,993
What did you think?
That l sit on this pillow every day?

494
01:01:47,136 --> 01:01:49,661
l'm pissed off travelling 12 hours
in a truck

495
01:02:25,274 --> 01:02:29,370
Mother, he is Mr.Shankaran.
Art lndia magazines.

496
01:02:36,786 --> 01:02:39,914
l was telling Siddharth about
my friend who lives in Kasauli

497
01:02:40,757 --> 01:02:43,351
He hosts a painting workshop
every year

498
01:02:43,793 --> 01:02:45,226
And you feel that he must
go there

499
01:02:45,595 --> 01:02:46,391
Absolutely

500
01:02:46,729 --> 01:02:48,754
lt'll be a very good experience
for him

501
01:02:57,940 --> 01:02:58,429
Oh, you're here!

502
01:02:59,776 --> 01:03:03,769
You're a strange boy!
you invite me and act surprised when l come.

503
01:03:05,448 --> 01:03:08,417
Ma, this is Tara!
Tara Jaiswal. You introduced us before

504
01:03:30,706 --> 01:03:34,142
How long will you go around
with that glum face...

505
01:03:34,977 --> 01:03:38,606
Come. Let me introduce you
to these sweet girls

506
01:03:39,649 --> 01:03:40,274
Forget it man.

507
01:03:41,184 --> 01:03:41,912
l'm not in the mood

508
01:03:44,320 --> 01:03:45,218
Are you fine?

509
01:03:51,160 --> 01:03:51,990
Look... Kristine!

510
01:04:10,146 --> 01:04:10,976
Do you like it?

511
01:04:13,950 --> 01:04:15,315
l like them all

512
01:04:16,953 --> 01:04:20,514
lt's difficult to say
which one is your best

513
01:04:22,391 --> 01:04:24,052
l haven't painted my best yet

514
01:04:25,461 --> 01:04:26,189
Why not?

515
01:04:27,263 --> 01:04:28,230
You don't seem to have the time?

516
01:04:31,868 --> 01:04:36,737
On such a big day in your life
l've to agree to your wish.

517
01:04:38,407 --> 01:04:40,841
Tell me, when you will
start my painting?

518
01:04:41,544 --> 01:04:42,010
Tomorrow

519
01:04:54,857 --> 01:04:56,688
Wait, l'll be out in a minute.

520
01:04:57,059 --> 01:04:58,185
- No problem

521
01:05:21,517 --> 01:05:29,049
What season is this in which the
heart blooms like a flower.

522
01:05:36,599 --> 01:05:43,903
What season is this in which the
heart blooms like a flower.

523
01:05:44,173 --> 01:05:47,734
...in which the colours merge...

524
01:05:48,010 --> 01:05:51,275
...and all the fragrances
blend

525
01:05:51,781 --> 01:05:55,342
Moonlight, brooks
and clouds...

526
01:05:55,651 --> 01:05:59,143
Songs, rain
and butterflies...

527
01:05:59,355 --> 01:06:04,759
They all seem favourable to me

528
01:06:10,733 --> 01:06:17,969
What season is this in which
the heart blooms like a flower

529
01:06:25,781 --> 01:06:26,770
Oh look!

530
01:06:28,484 --> 01:06:30,884
Banks of a river...

531
01:06:32,288 --> 01:06:38,318
A bird calls out
to another bird

532
01:06:40,896 --> 01:06:45,959
Look, at the river itself...

533
01:06:47,370 --> 01:06:53,468
She flows on to unite
with the sea

534
01:06:55,745 --> 01:07:00,978
All these journeys
are part of love's caravan

535
01:07:03,686 --> 01:07:11,149
What season is this in which
the heart blooms like a flower

536
01:07:49,131 --> 01:07:50,359
Oh how

537
01:07:51,734 --> 01:07:54,862
can l explain...

538
01:07:55,471 --> 01:08:01,706
How can l make you understand
what love is!

539
01:08:04,146 --> 01:08:09,880
There are no attachments
in love

540
01:08:10,586 --> 01:08:17,048
And neither
are there any barriers

541
01:08:18,761 --> 01:08:25,394
Love's saga is extraordinary

542
01:08:26,936 --> 01:08:34,570
What season is this in which
the heart blooms like a flower

543
01:08:34,777 --> 01:08:38,076
..in which all the colours merge...

544
01:08:38,280 --> 01:08:41,579
...and all the fragrances
blend

545
01:08:42,051 --> 01:08:45,509
Moonlight, brooks
and clouds...

546
01:08:45,821 --> 01:08:49,416
Songs, rain
and butterflies...

547
01:08:49,625 --> 01:08:55,757
They all seem favourable to me

548
01:08:57,299 --> 01:09:04,762
What season is this in which
the heart blooms like a flower

549
01:09:49,451 --> 01:09:50,179
Greetings, Aunty.

550
01:09:54,690 --> 01:09:55,816
Are you going out, Sameer?

551
01:09:56,025 --> 01:09:57,686
Ya, to Akash's...Why?

552
01:10:02,198 --> 01:10:02,994
l'll be back

553
01:10:16,312 --> 01:10:17,336
Mom! What's the matter?

554
01:10:17,580 --> 01:10:20,276
The fact is, Nareshji's daughter
Pooja is coming here

555
01:10:21,217 --> 01:10:24,516
And we want the two of you to...

556
01:10:26,555 --> 01:10:27,351
What! Fixing my marriage...!

557
01:10:29,391 --> 01:10:31,188
An arranged marriage!
No, Mom. Not for me

558
01:10:31,393 --> 01:10:34,521
Why not? Your Daddy and l had
an arranged marriage

559
01:10:35,564 --> 01:10:39,523
Listen to me. We are not forcing
you to get married

560
01:10:39,735 --> 01:10:41,362
We have known them for years

561
01:10:41,570 --> 01:10:43,868
And we thought we'd turn friendship
into a marriage alliance

562
01:10:45,241 --> 01:10:47,709
You don't lose anything by
meeting Pooja, do you?

563
01:10:50,379 --> 01:10:54,076
Okay. But you know my answer.
And that's NO!

564
01:11:00,222 --> 01:11:01,052
Who is it, Sameer?

565
01:11:23,846 --> 01:11:26,212
Er...Sameer, we have something
important to discuss

566
01:11:28,751 --> 01:11:30,082
Nareshji, is that all right?

567
01:11:32,087 --> 01:11:35,113
Anyway, they'll get bored
sitting with us oldies

568
01:11:58,814 --> 01:12:00,281
Are they your friends?

569
01:12:00,916 --> 01:12:01,382
Please sit down

570
01:12:06,655 --> 01:12:08,782
This is Akash and this is Sid

571
01:12:10,092 --> 01:12:11,457
Seems like a deep friendship

572
01:12:11,794 --> 01:12:14,627
Either the friendship is deep
or it's a 3-D photograph

573
01:12:32,715 --> 01:12:36,981
Pooja, you do know why
you're here, don't you?

574
01:12:38,020 --> 01:12:40,750
Yes. Mom and Dad told me

575
01:12:44,326 --> 01:12:46,317
Look, honestly speaking...

576
01:12:46,528 --> 01:12:50,259
When Mom told me about this...
l felt it wasn't right at first...

577
01:12:50,866 --> 01:12:55,166
...but now...l'm so happy you said no to
this arranged marriage bullshit!

578
01:13:01,543 --> 01:13:03,670
l think marriages shouldn't be
made like this

579
01:13:03,879 --> 01:13:06,677
lt's so important to love somebody
to get married

580
01:13:07,383 --> 01:13:08,145
What do you think?

581
01:13:08,384 --> 01:13:09,510
Yes, absolutely

582
01:13:12,388 --> 01:13:13,355
Why? Are you in love with
someone?

583
01:13:26,402 --> 01:13:27,835
There is this guy in my life

584
01:13:28,237 --> 01:13:30,933
But l guess l don't love him
enough so far to marry him

585
01:13:32,074 --> 01:13:33,473
l pretty much feel the same...

586
01:13:35,110 --> 01:13:36,771
...but not about the guy in your life!

587
01:13:43,085 --> 01:13:43,881
And then?

588
01:13:44,887 --> 01:13:46,718
Then what!
She went home

589
01:13:50,492 --> 01:13:51,049
lt's a problem man

590
01:14:00,903 --> 01:14:03,565
Please don't tell me you've
fallen for her after all this!

591
01:14:07,776 --> 01:14:08,242
Look, Sameer...

592
01:14:08,777 --> 01:14:10,745
l have no doubt whatsoever
you have fallen in love with her

593
01:14:11,280 --> 01:14:13,407
But l'm equally sure that after
3 months...

594
01:14:13,615 --> 01:14:14,775
...you'll be in love with some other
girl

595
01:14:15,551 --> 01:14:16,245
No, Akash

596
01:14:18,787 --> 01:14:21,915
l always thought l knew
what love was

597
01:14:22,124 --> 01:14:23,955
l realized today that l was
completely wrong

598
01:14:24,827 --> 01:14:25,259
ls that so!

599
01:14:26,728 --> 01:14:29,595
Akash, when Pooja told me about
that guy in her life ...

600
01:14:29,798 --> 01:14:33,165
For the first time l thought about
all those girls in my life...

601
01:14:33,469 --> 01:14:34,936
l was attracted to all of them...

602
01:14:35,370 --> 01:14:37,395
But l was wrong to think
the attraction was love

603
01:14:39,641 --> 01:14:41,438
And now you love Pooja?

604
01:14:41,643 --> 01:14:46,080
Yes. That's it!
l love Pooja

605
01:14:47,149 --> 01:14:48,776
Then tell her

606
01:14:51,286 --> 01:14:54,050
Take my advice. Don't say
anything to anyone

607
01:14:54,990 --> 01:14:55,957
There's no trusting you

608
01:14:56,158 --> 01:14:57,625
Today it's Pooja,
tomorrow it'll be some Ahuja!

609
01:15:14,510 --> 01:15:16,478
How did you know it's
my birthday?

610
01:15:17,846 --> 01:15:19,143
Didn't you mention it?

611
01:15:20,582 --> 01:15:22,140
l am so happy today

612
01:15:23,519 --> 01:15:27,478
Guess what? Esha called me

613
01:15:30,859 --> 01:15:32,656
She is coming to see me today

614
01:15:34,830 --> 01:15:36,263
My daughter is coming here...

615
01:15:48,243 --> 01:15:50,507
Sid, she remembered it's
my birthday today

616
01:15:54,216 --> 01:15:57,344
l'll be seeing her after 5 years!

617
01:15:58,921 --> 01:16:01,685
l've cooked everything myself.
l baked a cake

618
01:16:03,992 --> 01:16:05,186
l'm so happy

619
01:16:05,727 --> 01:16:08,355
ls Esha coming alone or your...

620
01:16:08,797 --> 01:16:13,860
Oh no. She told him she's going to
a friend's birthday party...

621
01:16:14,236 --> 01:16:18,036
Because Ajay will never let her
come here

622
01:16:21,977 --> 01:16:22,944
Would you like to meet her?

623
01:16:25,547 --> 01:16:26,206
lt'll make me happy

624
01:16:33,922 --> 01:16:37,551
How dare you teach my daughter
to lie? Have you no shame?

625
01:16:39,928 --> 01:16:43,728
Thank God l heard Esha
talk to you over the phone

626
01:16:44,099 --> 01:16:46,067
Why don't you stay away from her?

627
01:16:46,768 --> 01:16:48,065
l am her mother!

628
01:16:48,503 --> 01:16:51,904
You were her mother but now
Kiran is her mother

629
01:16:52,608 --> 01:16:54,405
lt'd be wise of you to understand
this

630
01:16:54,943 --> 01:16:57,571
Don't ever try to meet Esha again

631
01:16:58,113 --> 01:17:00,411
Not unless you want me to take
you to court... again

632
01:17:01,783 --> 01:17:03,216
You understand what l'm getting at,
don't you?

633
01:17:45,827 --> 01:17:47,624
He tells me l am not Esha's mother!

634
01:17:47,829 --> 01:17:48,796
That Esha is not my daughter!

635
01:17:48,997 --> 01:17:55,630
l am her mother...

636
01:18:00,942 --> 01:18:02,204
He married again

637
01:18:03,345 --> 01:18:06,803
He destroyed all my dreams.
l said nothing

638
01:18:08,617 --> 01:18:10,642
Because l had everything...

639
01:18:12,721 --> 01:18:13,483
l had my Esha

640
01:18:16,591 --> 01:18:21,824
But now...l have nothing

641
01:18:22,964 --> 01:18:24,158
l have nothing at all

642
01:18:25,300 --> 01:18:33,867
l am nothing. Nothing.

643
01:18:56,598 --> 01:19:01,399
You know, crying doesn't suit
you at all

644
01:19:03,739 --> 01:19:05,206
What else can l do!

645
01:19:08,410 --> 01:19:09,707
You can come with me

646
01:20:04,566 --> 01:20:08,263
You two must be wondering where
Siddharth has brought you!

647
01:20:08,470 --> 01:20:11,098
No such thing. We'd go
anywhere to eat cake

648
01:20:18,880 --> 01:20:19,938
Will you dance with me?

649
01:20:22,184 --> 01:20:25,347
Where?
- Right here there's lot of space, come.

650
01:21:20,709 --> 01:21:21,676
Sid, we've reached your house

651
01:21:26,882 --> 01:21:28,349
What?

652
01:21:35,390 --> 01:21:36,516
You're joking, right?

653
01:21:41,563 --> 01:21:43,190
Hey Akash, he's serious man!

654
01:21:44,499 --> 01:21:45,864
Have you gone mad?

655
01:21:52,807 --> 01:21:55,207
Sid, my knowledge of such
things is a bit sad but...

656
01:21:55,911 --> 01:21:57,344
...this is a but much, isn't it?

657
01:22:00,115 --> 01:22:02,310
ls that because she's older?

658
01:22:02,751 --> 01:22:05,049
No. l mean that too

659
01:22:07,355 --> 01:22:09,050
Wait a minute! Why are we even
discussing this nonsense?

660
01:22:12,861 --> 01:22:15,728
Because l thought that may be
you guys would understand

661
01:22:22,203 --> 01:22:24,899
Hey Sid! Understand what?

662
01:22:27,108 --> 01:22:30,737
You say you love a woman who
is 10 to 15 years older than you...

663
01:22:31,313 --> 01:22:34,248
...has a daughter, had a husband

664
01:22:35,317 --> 01:22:37,581
You've told us she has a
drinking problem

665
01:22:37,786 --> 01:22:38,912
What should we understand?
- Just this...

666
01:22:39,354 --> 01:22:41,413
l know all this and still
love her

667
01:22:42,057 --> 01:22:45,891
But Sid, think about it.
This isn't love, it's insanity

668
01:22:46,094 --> 01:22:48,756
No. This is love

669
01:22:51,800 --> 01:22:54,098
l don't expect her to be mine
or marry me

670
01:22:54,469 --> 01:22:55,766
l don't expect any such thing

671
01:22:56,771 --> 01:22:59,103
Even if she doesn't love me,
it's okay because l...

672
01:22:59,307 --> 01:23:02,606
okay! l get it

673
01:23:03,912 --> 01:23:07,109
Remember, Sameer? Even l had
started off like this

674
01:23:07,916 --> 01:23:11,374
Started what off?
Oh. Of course.

675
01:23:11,586 --> 01:23:15,454
Okay, Sid. lf that's what it's about
then l have no objection

676
01:23:16,091 --> 01:23:17,786
ln fact she's perfect for you

677
01:23:18,193 --> 01:23:22,459
She's experienced, lives alone.
You visit her everyday

678
01:23:24,265 --> 01:23:26,460
Learn from him, Sameer

679
01:23:26,801 --> 01:23:29,133
Really, Sid. You couldn't have
chosen better...

680
01:23:34,075 --> 01:23:35,975
How disgusting can you get!

681
01:23:39,147 --> 01:23:43,345
Here l am telling you l love her and
you make it sound so sick and dirty

682
01:23:48,490 --> 01:23:51,152
We don't have to approve
everything our friends do

683
01:23:52,660 --> 01:23:54,992
But there is a line in every
friendship that shouldn't be crossed

684
01:23:55,196 --> 01:23:56,629
And you have crossed it today

685
01:24:02,037 --> 01:24:05,939
At some point in life everyone
experiences true love

686
01:24:08,143 --> 01:24:11,670
Then all the things you said...
about her age and stuff...

687
01:24:13,314 --> 01:24:17,375
They don't mean anything.
They all seem trivial

688
01:24:21,289 --> 01:24:22,779
You won't understand this today

689
01:24:25,560 --> 01:24:26,857
But some day you will know...

690
01:24:27,062 --> 01:24:28,927
You don't decide to fall in love

691
01:24:30,698 --> 01:24:31,665
lt just happens

692
01:24:38,573 --> 01:24:39,699
Are you finished?

693
01:24:49,918 --> 01:24:50,748
Sameer, are you coming?

694
01:25:46,474 --> 01:25:47,736
l still remember that night

695
01:25:55,884 --> 01:25:58,182
l never thought things would go
that far

696
01:26:04,592 --> 01:26:05,684
l couldn't sleep all night

697
01:26:07,262 --> 01:26:08,752
l went and met Akash
the next morning

698
01:26:48,703 --> 01:26:50,534
These things happen
between friends

699
01:26:51,005 --> 01:26:54,338
Let's go meet Sid.
He must be feeling bad too

700
01:26:56,611 --> 01:26:58,511
You're sure to run into him
somewhere

701
01:26:58,913 --> 01:27:01,711
What'll you do? lgnore him?

702
01:27:08,323 --> 01:27:09,517
You're coming to meet Sid

703
01:27:12,060 --> 01:27:13,186
Leave me alone, Sameer!

704
01:27:39,787 --> 01:27:40,754
l have to see Sid

705
01:27:41,089 --> 01:27:41,987
He's gone

706
01:27:42,190 --> 01:27:43,953
Where? - Kasauli

707
01:27:44,359 --> 01:27:49,228
They called yesterday to say his
application was accepted. So he...

708
01:27:52,233 --> 01:27:55,532
What is it, Sameer?
ls everything alright?

709
01:27:57,772 --> 01:28:00,639
Of course. l should go

710
01:28:07,682 --> 01:28:10,981
l didn't realise that things
would never be the same again

711
01:28:11,886 --> 01:28:16,289
You went to Kasauli...A week later,
Akash left for Australia

712
01:28:27,902 --> 01:28:29,130
Take care of yourself

713
01:28:29,671 --> 01:28:32,834
You remember the name of the man
who'll receive you in Sydney?

714
01:28:33,041 --> 01:28:36,169
Mr.Mehta...Relax, Dad.
l remember

715
01:28:41,816 --> 01:28:44,011
Bye. l'll call you from there

716
01:28:47,655 --> 01:28:49,589
l must tell you something
-What's it?

717
01:28:51,526 --> 01:28:58,398
l always made fun of your
endless romantic entanglements

718
01:29:00,601 --> 01:29:03,968
Never stopped to think how you
must feel

719
01:29:06,274 --> 01:29:09,437
You know l was just kidding,
don't you?

720
01:29:13,147 --> 01:29:14,171
Don't worry about it

721
01:29:14,849 --> 01:29:16,248
You weren't the only one who was
kidding

722
01:29:17,785 --> 01:29:18,877
You remember Shalini?

723
01:29:20,355 --> 01:29:22,846
l remember Shalini...
And Rohit's punch as well

724
01:29:24,258 --> 01:29:25,987
l knew she was Rohit's fiancee

725
01:29:28,262 --> 01:29:30,287
Why didn't you tell me?
Why didn't you stop me?

726
01:29:57,759 --> 01:29:58,691
l said Hi

727
01:30:02,563 --> 01:30:03,495
Where are you going?

728
01:30:05,400 --> 01:30:06,833
This flight goes to Sydney

729
01:30:07,568 --> 01:30:08,592
But where are you going?

730
01:30:11,406 --> 01:30:13,567
How strange! All three of us
are going to Sydney

731
01:30:14,809 --> 01:30:15,275
Three?

732
01:30:15,676 --> 01:30:17,337
Sure. You, me, and this flight

733
01:30:21,582 --> 01:30:23,174
You do know you're insane,
don't you?

734
01:30:31,926 --> 01:30:34,861
l'm really sorry about
the other night

735
01:30:36,431 --> 01:30:37,329
l was just kidding

736
01:30:45,907 --> 01:30:46,396
So what are you...

737
01:30:50,244 --> 01:30:51,768
What are you doing in Sydney?

738
01:30:52,847 --> 01:30:55,475
Dad has a business there he
wants me to manage...

739
01:30:56,184 --> 01:30:59,085
Let's see how long it lasts now.
And you?

740
01:31:00,221 --> 01:31:01,381
My uncle lives there

741
01:31:01,823 --> 01:31:04,121
My mother's brother.
l'm visiting him

742
01:31:04,659 --> 01:31:05,557
He's nothing like Rohit, is he!

743
01:31:09,997 --> 01:31:10,656
What does he do?

744
01:31:14,402 --> 01:31:15,596
Have you been to Sydney before?

745
01:31:17,738 --> 01:31:19,296
Do you always ask so many
questions?

746
01:31:19,841 --> 01:31:22,139
Yes. Have you been to Sydney
before?

747
01:31:22,944 --> 01:31:23,410
Yes

748
01:31:24,979 --> 01:31:26,378
Good. You can show me around

749
01:31:26,914 --> 01:31:30,145
Wait a minute. Don't you know
anybody else there?

750
01:31:30,985 --> 01:31:32,213
Of course. There is a Mr.Mehta

751
01:31:34,055 --> 01:31:36,023
And won't it be fun hanging out
with him?

752
01:31:40,661 --> 01:31:41,559
l said l'm sorry

753
01:31:42,296 --> 01:31:44,526
Okay but l will have to ask
my uncle

754
01:31:46,701 --> 01:31:48,293
But he won't refuse.

755
01:31:48,936 --> 01:31:49,402
Why?

756
01:31:50,171 --> 01:31:51,433
Because l have bought him a gift!

757
01:32:24,205 --> 01:32:26,366
l'm fine but please stop
calling me uncle now

758
01:32:26,574 --> 01:32:28,906
You've grown up which makes us
practically the same age

759
01:32:40,221 --> 01:32:41,313
So, is it a business trip?

760
01:32:41,522 --> 01:32:45,288
We have an export business and
Dad's exported me here to handle it

761
01:32:45,493 --> 01:32:47,222
Exports? Sounds very boring, man

762
01:32:47,428 --> 01:32:48,258
That's what l think too

763
01:32:48,829 --> 01:32:50,854
Personally, l prefer something more
adventurous...

764
01:32:51,599 --> 01:32:52,793
...like wild life photography

765
01:32:53,167 --> 01:32:54,429
You like photography?

766
01:32:55,403 --> 01:32:59,772
Mum says the first word l said
wasn't Papa or Mama...

767
01:32:59,974 --> 01:33:00,804
lt was camera!

768
01:33:05,079 --> 01:33:05,545

769
01:33:06,614 --> 01:33:08,241

771
01:33:17,091 --> 01:33:18,956
