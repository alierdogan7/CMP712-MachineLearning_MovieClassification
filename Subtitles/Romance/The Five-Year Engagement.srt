347
00:18:44,874 --> 00:18:48,754
<i>Violet, love, will you be getting
married in London or down in Sussex?</i>

348
00:18:48,836 --> 00:18:51,339
Actually, Baba, we will
be doing the wedding

349
00:18:51,422 --> 00:18:53,390
in the Bay Area
in San Francisco.

350
00:18:53,466 --> 00:18:56,219
You could get married here,
in the village church.

351
00:18:56,302 --> 00:18:59,602
Get married in England, where you're from.
In London, come on.

352
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:01,182
<i>Not 5,000 bloody mi/es...</i>

353
00:19:01,265 --> 00:19:05,065
<i>Violet, America is
such a long way away.</i>

354
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:08,318
<i>And grandparents do
have a tendency to die.</i>

355
00:19:08,397 --> 00:19:10,320
VIOLET: Mum, Stop it.

356
00:19:10,858 --> 00:19:12,860
They're all right there.
What are you doing?

357
00:19:12,943 --> 00:19:14,616
<i>Well, for now.</i>

358
00:19:14,695 --> 00:19:16,368
VIOLET: Mum, stop!

359
00:19:19,742 --> 00:19:22,370
Come on, Berkeley.
Come on, Berkeley.

00:19:28,209 --> 00:19:29,210
(SIGHS)

361
00:19:29,418 --> 00:19:31,341
So, the barn holds,
like, 350 people.

362
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:32,467
Oh, that's good.
Yeah.

363
00:19:32,546 --> 00:19:34,173
I really love it.
It's really beautiful.

364
00:19:34,548 --> 00:19:36,550
So, is it your wedding?
Yes, yeah, it is.

365
00:19:36,634 --> 00:19:38,261
That's too bad.

366
00:19:38,344 --> 00:19:40,096
You're so beautiful.

367
00:19:40,721 --> 00:19:41,768
Okay.

368
00:19:45,893 --> 00:19:47,019
(SIGHING)

369
00:19:47,728 --> 00:19:48,729
It's wonderful,
isn't it?

370
00:19:48,813 --> 00:19:50,281
It is so great.

371
00:19:50,564 --> 00:19:53,158
It's beautiful. When's the
next available weekend?

372
00:19:53,234 --> 00:19:55,032
In three years.

373
00:19:55,111 --> 00:19:56,988
Unless you want to get
married on September 11th.

374
00:19:58,989 --> 00:20:00,286
I don't.

375
00:20:01,367 --> 00:20:03,790
Don't let the
terrorists win.

376
00:20:05,037 --> 00:20:06,380
Yes!
Great!

377
00:20:06,455 --> 00:20:07,923
Okay, good, so this
is gonna be fun.

378
00:20:07,998 --> 00:20:10,877
Of course, the men
will wear yarmulkes.

379
00:20:11,293 --> 00:20:14,888
And, in that case, all eligible
Christians will be served communion.

380
00:20:14,964 --> 00:20:17,592
Communion? What, we're gonna have
communion at my son's wedding?

381
00:20:17,758 --> 00:20:20,807
Um... It is our
wedding, Pete.

382
00:20:21,303 --> 00:20:23,806
And, I mean, seeing as everyone
is gonna be wearing yarmulkes.

383
00:20:24,306 --> 00:20:27,810
Well, actually, only the men
will be wearing yarmulkes, so.

384
00:20:27,893 --> 00:20:30,646
Well, I've never heard you say
the word "yarmulke" until today.

385
00:20:31,188 --> 00:20:33,111
TOM: Excuse me, I say "yarmulke" all the time.
VIOLET: You don't.

386
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:34,612
Like, "Hey,
where's my yarmulke?

387
00:20:34,692 --> 00:20:36,069
"Babe, have you
seen my yarmulke?"

388
00:20:36,152 --> 00:20:37,574
Babe, you don't
have a yarmulke.

389
00:20:37,653 --> 00:20:40,748
I have a whole... It's in
my Jewish drawer. You...

390
00:20:42,825 --> 00:20:45,294
I mean, how are you supposed to
even pick a dress from a magazine?

391
00:20:45,369 --> 00:20:48,498
Look at all of them, they're all
just white and puffy and stupid.

392
00:20:48,914 --> 00:20:51,463
Vi, come on. Hey!
(SIGHING) What?

393
00:20:51,542 --> 00:20:53,169
It's supposed
to be exciting.

394
00:20:53,377 --> 00:20:55,721
This is your wedding.
You only get a few of these.

395
00:20:56,922 --> 00:20:58,970
I didn't
get into Berkeley.

396
00:20:59,049 --> 00:21:01,768
It was the perfect teaching job.
It was local.

397
00:21:01,844 --> 00:21:02,936
Oh, God.

398
00:21:03,012 --> 00:21:05,185
Eight years of studying, just
(SPLUTTERS) down the tube.

399
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:06,481
I'm so sorry, babe.

400
00:21:06,557 --> 00:21:08,434
I'm going to be married
within the year.

401
00:21:08,517 --> 00:21:10,019
I'm gonna be pregnant
within two years

402
00:21:10,853 --> 00:21:14,107
and no career, I'll just
be changing nappies

403
00:21:14,190 --> 00:21:17,114
and washing dishes
and making apple pie.

404
00:21:17,193 --> 00:21:19,537
And I want that,
I want it all,

405
00:21:19,612 --> 00:21:21,285
but I want to have
the career as well.

406
00:21:21,363 --> 00:21:23,115
It's not enough for me.

407
00:21:23,199 --> 00:21:25,793
I mean, it's fine.
I can reapply next year.

408
00:21:25,868 --> 00:21:27,415
You don't have
to get upset.

409
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:31,465
It's fine. Why do you always
turn things into your thing?

410
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:32,666
(TEARFULLY) No.
Come on!

411
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:34,718
I'm sorry.
What?

412
00:21:34,794 --> 00:21:36,671
I can't help it.
It must be the hormones.

413
00:21:36,754 --> 00:21:40,179
What, you're at that time of the month again?
You're always on your period.

414
00:21:40,257 --> 00:21:41,725
No.

415
00:21:41,801 --> 00:21:43,428
What is it, then?

416
00:21:45,721 --> 00:21:47,268
Are you pregnant?

417
00:21:48,057 --> 00:21:49,650
Just a little.

418
00:21:49,725 --> 00:21:51,102
Just a little?

419
00:21:51,227 --> 00:21:53,025
(WHIMPERS)
Suzie!

420
00:21:53,813 --> 00:21:55,315
God, I feel so guilty.
Crikey!

421
00:21:55,397 --> 00:21:57,149
I know this is your time,

422
00:21:57,233 --> 00:21:59,702
and I just... I don't want to
take the attention away from you.

423
00:21:59,777 --> 00:22:01,074
I'm sorry.

424
00:22:01,153 --> 00:22:02,655
Who's the guy?

425
00:22:03,322 --> 00:22:05,040
I don't want
to tell you.

426
00:22:05,115 --> 00:22:06,412
Let me take
some guesses, okay?

427
00:22:06,534 --> 00:22:07,831
Just don't even
think about it.

428
00:22:07,910 --> 00:22:09,162
One, two, three.

429
00:22:09,245 --> 00:22:10,713
Alex.
Fucking hell!

430
00:22:10,788 --> 00:22:12,040
You didn't say it,
only I said it!

431
00:22:12,122 --> 00:22:14,045
Is it Alex?
It is Alex.

432
00:22:14,124 --> 00:22:15,341
Oh, gross!

433
00:22:15,417 --> 00:22:17,215
Of course it is. Jesus!

434
00:22:17,419 --> 00:22:19,547
No! He is a moron.

435
00:22:20,923 --> 00:22:22,220
Yeah.

436
00:22:22,299 --> 00:22:24,222

Absolutely. Theirs was
pretty, but I was very cold.

Okay, right?
Yeah.

the whole time.

It was very chilly.

I'm good.

454

No, I know you, you're not good.
What is going on?

455
00:25:19,643 --> 00:25:21,611
Okay.
Sit down and talk to me.

456

I got a letter from

Okay.
I got in.

Oh, my God! Congratulations,
that's great!

459
00:25:29,111 --> 00:25:31,034
No, no, no, it's not.
It's actually terrible.

460
00:25:31,113 --> 00:25:33,582
You know, I've been
sitting here panicking

461
00:25:33,657 --> 00:25:35,159
because my mum quit
her job for my dad

462
00:25:35,242 --> 00:25:36,664
and she never
forgave him, ever.

463
00:25:36,952 --> 00:25:40,047
She became a real martyr
and she's not <i>a</i> happy person,

464
00:25:40,122 --> 00:25:42,170
and I just don't want you
becoming my mother.

465

I really don't want you
becoming like her. Babe.

Calm down.
Okay.

00:25:47,838 --> 00:25:48,885
Okay, it's you and me.
Yeah.

We can handle anything.
I'm not scared of this.

469
00:25:51,467 --> 00:25:52,719
I know, I think
I'm just scared

470
00:25:52,801 --> 00:25:54,348
that you will
end up resenting me.

471
00:25:54,428 --> 00:25:55,850
This is a huge
opportunity for you.

472
00:25:56,346 --> 00:25:58,769
If you don't do this, you're
gonna end up resenting me,

473
00:25:58,849 --> 00:26:03,150
and, frankly, I would much rather
be the resentor than resented.

474
00:26:03,979 --> 00:26:07,654
Look, let's talk logistics.
How long is the thing?

475
00:26:08,484 --> 00:26:10,407
Two years.
Two years?

476
00:26:10,486 --> 00:26:11,783
Yeah. It's long.

477
00:26:11,862 --> 00:26:13,079
No, it's not.

478
00:26:13,155 --> 00:26:14,122
Really?

479
00:26:14,198 --> 00:26:16,917
In the scheme of us spending
our whole lives together,

480
00:26:16,992 --> 00:26:18,790
two years, that's...

481
00:26:19,995 --> 00:26:22,123
And then we can
come back here, right?

482
00:26:22,247 --> 00:26:24,966
Yeah, of course. It's just two years.
Yeah, that's...

483
00:26:25,084 --> 00:26:26,802
And, look, I can cook anywhere.
Right.

484
00:26:26,877 --> 00:26:29,380
I've cooked in New York,
I've cooked in L.A.

485
00:26:29,463 --> 00:26:31,932
I'm pretty sure
I can handle Michigan.

486
00:26:32,883 --> 00:26:33,930
Um...

487
00:26:34,009 --> 00:26:36,728
All right. Listen,
here's what I propose.

488
00:26:37,179 --> 00:26:39,398
Let's just put off the wedding.
We're not in any rush.

489
00:26:39,473 --> 00:26:40,474
Really?
Yeah.

490
00:26:40,682 --> 00:26:43,777
We'll get to Michigan,
we'll get settled in,

491
00:26:43,852 --> 00:26:46,025
and then we'll start planning
the wedding again from there

492
00:26:46,105 --> 00:26:47,527
once we have
our bearings.

493
00:26:47,606 --> 00:26:48,903
Tom.

494
00:26:49,441 --> 00:26:50,488
Oh!

495
00:26:55,531 --> 00:26:57,204
Can I just say something?
Yeah.

496
00:26:58,033 --> 00:27:02,789
I think we both know that I deserve
to get super laid for this.

497
00:27:03,539 --> 00:27:05,382
Do you want me to wear
a cape or something?

498
00:27:05,457 --> 00:27:07,255
I mean, theoretically,
whatever you want.

499
00:27:07,334 --> 00:27:08,551
I'm just saying I don't
want weekday sex.

500
00:27:08,627 --> 00:27:10,595
You're guilt-sexing me! I want a show.
I want the show.

501
00:27:10,712 --> 00:27:12,134
You're gonna get the show.
Good, I better.

502
00:27:12,214 --> 00:27:14,137
You're gonna get the
Cirque du Soleil of shows.

503
00:27:15,217 --> 00:27:17,470
Lots of this.
And this stuff.

504
00:27:18,387 --> 00:27:20,139
Not a mime.
Yeah.

505
00:27:20,222 --> 00:27:21,815

think our family

is going to be disappointed
that we're delaying?

No.

519
00:27:59,303 --> 00:28:02,523

have told me that earlier.

00:28:14,818 --> 00:28:18,243
Okay, so my fiancée,
Violet, who you've met,

526
00:28:18,822 --> 00:28:20,540
got a job in Michigan...

527
00:28:20,616 --> 00:28:23,540
This is why marriage
is dumb, okay? It's dumb.

00:28:23,619 --> 00:28:25,417
You have a job here,
and she's got a job there.

529
00:28:25,495 --> 00:28:27,839
You guys can't do anything
because you're so connected,

530

has to get the shaft.

And, <i>as</i> of now,
we don't have one.

630
00:34:00,747 --> 00:34:05,127
So, we need ideas for some
studies that we can run,

631
00:34:05,210 --> 00:34:08,180
and this is my main
area of interest, here.

632
00:34:08,463 --> 00:34:12,764
Good. So I want to do the
marshmallow experiment with adults.

633
00:34:12,842 --> 00:34:15,265
Well, adults will just wait
for the second marshmallow.

634

I actually don't even think
adults really like marshmallows.

Yeah, well, I'm not referring
specifically to the marshmallow.

00:34:21,017 --> 00:34:22,394
What about this?

637
00:34:22,477 --> 00:34:24,571
What if we were to
take our subjects, right,

638
00:34:24,646 --> 00:34:26,694
and have them play
a driving video game?

639
00:34:27,649 --> 00:34:30,402
Have half of the subjects
drive the car normally.

640
00:34:30,485 --> 00:34:32,579
Have the other half
drive while masturbating.

641
00:34:33,363 --> 00:34:35,661
Why do all of your experiments
have to involve masturbation?

642
00:34:35,991 --> 00:34:38,494
Why do none of your experiments
involve masturbation?

643
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:40,662
Um... What if we,

644
00:34:41,454 --> 00:34:45,755
um, casually left a box of stale
donuts in the testing room?

645
00:34:46,668 --> 00:34:48,841
And you inform the subjects
that these stale donuts

646
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:50,513
will be replaced
with new donuts

647
00:34:51,006 --> 00:34:52,929
20 minutes from then.

648
00:34:53,008 --> 00:34:57,479
But then we watch and we see who
still goes for an old donut.

is if we had a manipulation.

and see how long it takes

I love a love story.
How did you guys meet?

688
00:36:29,979 --> 00:36:31,322
I'll take this one, if
that's all right. Okay.

689
00:36:31,398 --> 00:36:32,399
Yeah.

Gwyrth?
What a fascinating name.

701
00:36:58,508 --> 00:37:01,057
It's actually pronounced
"Gwyrth." It's Welsh.

702
00:37:01,136 --> 00:37:02,604
Gwyrf.
Gwyth.

703
00:37:02,679 --> 00:37:03,931
With an "F"?

704

Gwyrth.

No, no, "Gwyrth."

Gwyth.
WINTON: No, it's "Gwyrth."

NO. G-W-Y-R-T-H. "Gwyrth."

What do you do, Tom?

now, I work at Zingerman's.

Not this small.

786
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:07,072
Take your pants off.
Let's do it.

787
00:40:07,155 --> 00:40:08,657
It's going to look
like a baby's dick.

788

Okay, you're ruining
the moment.

00:40:23,338 --> 00:40:24,385

00:41:05,546 --> 00:41:06,798
Yeah.

812
00:41:06,965 --> 00:41:07,966
I knitted it.

813
00:41:08,049 --> 00:41:10,643
Oh, cool. Awesome.
Yeah.

814
00:41:10,718 --> 00:41:14,268
My kids used to take these
really long, boring naps.

815
00:41:14,347 --> 00:41:18,318
And, for a while, I just stared at them.
But then I found knitting.

816
00:41:18,393 --> 00:41:21,272
I can knit you one if you want.
It's super-cozy.

817

818
00:41:25,733 --> 00:41:29,078
Wow, that actually
is super-cozy.

819
00:41:29,237 --> 00:41:30,659
Yeah.
Yeah.

820
00:41:30,738 --> 00:41:35,084
See, I told you this place is awesome.
You just gotta settle into it.

Hello!
Look at her.

824
00:42:00,768 --> 00:42:02,395
Let me hold her.

825
00:42:02,478 --> 00:42:05,448
Careful, Violet. Mind her neck.
You did it.

826
00:42:07,692 --> 00:42:10,115
You're so clever.

827
00:42:11,279 --> 00:42:12,656
It's adorable.

828
00:42:12,739 --> 00:42:14,787
See, he calls it an "it."

829
00:42:15,867 --> 00:42:18,837
Dude, Clam Bar.
Booked for an entire month.

830
00:42:19,454 --> 00:42:21,047
You cannot get
a table for 30 days.

831
00:42:21,122 --> 00:42:23,625
Thank you so much for quitting, bro.
You made my career.

832
00:42:23,708 --> 00:42:26,336
Oh. Yeah, I did it alt
for you, buddy.

833
00:42:26,961 --> 00:42:28,884
Anyways, so how's Michigan?

834
00:42:29,464 --> 00:42:32,889
You know, it's a bit of an adjustment.
But, all in all, it's fine.

835
00:42:32,967 --> 00:42:34,219
Wow.
Sorry.

836
00:42:34,302 --> 00:42:36,304
Have you told her
how much you hate it?

837
00:42:36,387 --> 00:42:37,980
I don't hate it.

838
00:42:39,265 --> 00:42:41,188
A bit of Irish stoicism
never hurt anyone.

839
00:42:41,267 --> 00:42:44,487
Well, I think it hurt
a shitload of Irish people.

840
00:42:45,396 --> 00:42:48,240
Bro, you gotta be
honest with her, man.

841
00:42:48,316 --> 00:42:49,693
I am honest.

842
00:42:50,985 --> 00:42:52,032
No, you're not.

843
00:42:52,111 --> 00:42:53,203
You're not being
honest with me.

844
00:42:53,321 --> 00:42:54,447
You're not being
honest with her.

845
00:42:54,530 --> 00:42:55,747
Don't be a martyr.

846
00:42:55,823 --> 00:42:57,325
Trust me, dude.

847
00:42:57,408 --> 00:43:01,458
You need to be honest with this woman.
She's going to be your wife.

848
00:43:01,788 --> 00:43:04,462
Like me, for example, when Suzie
told me that she was pregnant,

849
00:43:04,540 --> 00:43:05,917
I was like,

850
00:43:07,001 --> 00:43:10,175
"There's no fucking way
you're keeping this baby."

851
00:43:10,671 --> 00:43:12,344
Because that's what I felt.

852
00:43:12,423 --> 00:43:15,723
I was like, "No.
It's not mine, I know it."

853
00:43:15,802 --> 00:43:17,600
Because I was being honest.

854
00:43:17,678 --> 00:43:19,680
I didn't get caught up on
how that would make her feel.

855
00:43:19,972 --> 00:43:21,770
You know,
I was just being myself.

856
00:43:21,849 --> 00:43:24,568
She, of course,
figured out later

857
00:43:24,644 --> 00:43:28,194
that that was just panic
and anger setting in.

858
00:43:28,606 --> 00:43:29,607
And now she knows
that about me.

859
00:43:29,690 --> 00:43:31,317
So, two weeks ago, when I
was trying to talk her into

860
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:33,118
giving up
the baby for adoption,

861
00:43:33,194 --> 00:43:35,947
she's like, "Is this panic,
and is this anger?"

862
00:43:36,030 --> 00:43:38,874
And I was like,
"Oh, my God, it is.

863
00:43:39,367 --> 00:43:40,619
"Let's keep it."

864
00:43:40,701 --> 00:43:43,079
Let's just...
Let's go see your family.

865
00:43:49,836 --> 00:43:52,009
So, darling?
VIOLET: Mmm-hmm?

866
00:43:52,964 --> 00:43:56,138
Any ideas when this new
wedding might happen?

867
00:43:56,634 --> 00:43:59,228
Mmm. No...
I mean, not yet.

868
00:43:59,303 --> 00:44:00,896
Because, you know,
we've just moved

869
00:44:01,013 --> 00:44:02,606
and it's just a big
transition, and so...

870
00:44:02,682 --> 00:44:05,105
Look, it's never
going to be easy.

871
00:44:05,601 --> 00:44:09,231
I mean, you could delay forever.
Like you did with Gideon.

872
00:44:09,730 --> 00:44:11,732
You always need
things to be perfect.

873
00:44:11,816 --> 00:44:15,116
Mum, it's hardly the same, all right?
Gideon was a complete tool

874
00:44:15,194 --> 00:44:16,992
and so that's why I was
procrastinating as much as I did.

875
00:44:17,071 --> 00:44:18,414
What's the date?

876
00:44:18,531 --> 00:44:20,283
I don't know yet, Mum. You've
got to make a date, darling.

877
00:44:20,366 --> 00:44:21,333
I don't know yet,
Mum, and I will.

878
00:44:21,409 --> 00:44:23,537
Pick a date. Why is
that so difficult?

879
00:44:23,619 --> 00:44:24,666
It's not difficult.

880
00:44:24,745 --> 00:44:26,088
I'm just saying that
we've just got there

881
00:44:26,205 --> 00:44:27,548
and we're trying
to enjoy ourselves.

882
00:44:27,623 --> 00:44:28,624
Pick a date. Pick it,
pick it, pick it!

883
00:44:28,708 --> 00:44:31,336
Okay. I cannot think with you
yelling "Pick it" at me.

884
00:44:31,419 --> 00:44:32,420
Shh!

885
00:44:35,464 --> 00:44:36,761
You know why you're not sure?

886
00:44:37,466 --> 00:44:39,434
No. Because you've
never been sure.

887
00:44:39,510 --> 00:44:41,683
Okay, what I don't understand
is that you hated marriage.

888
00:44:42,013 --> 00:44:43,640
So why are you
forcing me into it?

889
00:44:44,307 --> 00:44:47,026
Well, well, well,
Miss Smarty-pants.

890
00:44:47,351 --> 00:44:49,854
For your information,
I did not hate marriage,

891
00:44:49,937 --> 00:44:51,564
I loved marriage.

892
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:55,990
I loved your father, always.
I was happy.

893
00:44:56,444 --> 00:44:58,321
That's why I'm so
angry with him now.

894
00:44:58,821 --> 00:45:00,949
I was happy with
that idiot!

895
00:45:01,532 --> 00:45:03,330
I'm sorry I'm
not 23 years old.

896
00:45:03,451 --> 00:45:05,249
I'm sorry I'm
not made in China.

897
00:45:05,328 --> 00:45:07,626
I'm sorry I'm not
Miss Chew Chin Chow!

(SUZIE MOANS)

902
00:45:23,012 --> 00:45:26,391
Crazy about Alex
and the Clam Bar, right?

903
00:45:26,474 --> 00:45:27,600
Yeah.

904
00:45:28,559 --> 00:45:30,653
It's good, though.
You know, it really is.

905
00:45:30,728 --> 00:45:31,980
It's good for him.

906
00:45:32,063 --> 00:45:33,280
Are you okay about it?

907
00:45:33,356 --> 00:45:34,733
I'm fine.

908
00:45:39,904 --> 00:45:41,747
Um... So, you know
what I was thinking?

909
00:45:41,822 --> 00:45:43,995
I know that we're not
in any rush or anything,

910
00:45:44,075 --> 00:45:47,454
but do you think maybe we should
start planning this wedding?

911
00:45:47,578 --> 00:45:49,501
Yes! I was just thinking that.
Yeah?

912
00:45:49,580 --> 00:45:50,627
Okay. Great.
Yes.

913
00:45:50,706 --> 00:45:52,333
I'll take the lead this time.
No.

914
00:45:52,416 --> 00:45:55,260
Listen, you're super-busy.
I've got time to do it.

915
00:45:55,336 --> 00:45:57,589
You can just... Look, pitch
in when you can, but...

916
00:45:58,256 --> 00:45:59,382
Would you really do that?

917
00:45:59,465 --> 00:46:02,344
You did everything last time.
It's a two-way street.

918
00:46:02,426 --> 00:46:03,803
Thank you.

919
00:46:04,595 --> 00:46:05,972
Of course.
That's very kind.

920
00:46:06,055 --> 00:46:08,149
You're a very
good planner.

921
00:46:11,727 --> 00:46:14,150
I hope you like Legoland.

YOU are my enormous man.

927
00:46:33,749 --> 00:46:36,298
Right, so who's
going to be our actor?

928
00:46:37,962 --> 00:46:40,806
Hmm? No, no, please, no.
I really don't want to do it.

929
00:46:40,881 --> 00:46:43,304
Come on, it's simple. You just
explain the personality test,

930
00:46:43,384 --> 00:46:44,601
then casually mention

931
00:46:44,677 --> 00:46:46,145
that the day-old donuts will
be replaced by fresh ones.

932
00:46:46,220 --> 00:46:47,312
No, I know what
I'm going to say.

933
00:46:47,638 --> 00:46:49,766
Anyone who takes an old donut has
got impulse control problems.

934
00:46:49,849 --> 00:46:51,146
No, I know, it's just...
I'm going to freeze up.

to be great.

something in your voice.

it's not a secret.

It's just that... I think I just
wish Tom were happier here.

Has he told you
he's unhappy?

No, but I can tell.

Listen, I think
Tom is fantastic.

situation make you feel guilty.

to get here. Okay?

00:50:39,954 --> 00:50:42,628
No, no way.
You like it too much.

1026
00:50:42,706 --> 00:50:43,958
Ming.
(SIGHING)

1027
00:50:44,041 --> 00:50:45,167
God damn it!
Go on.

1028
00:50:48,837 --> 00:50:49,963
How come nobody
ever asks me?

1029
00:50:50,047 --> 00:50:52,721
Because you'll make
the whole room masturbate.

1030
00:50:53,884 --> 00:50:55,386
(BOTH LAUGHING)

1031
00:51:03,894 --> 00:51:05,817
Hmm. Impressive.

1032
00:51:05,896 --> 00:51:10,276
It is very interesting that there was
that 25% correlation in both groups

1033
00:51:10,359 --> 00:51:12,828
in that subjects who had a
history of life disruption

1034
00:51:12,903 --> 00:51:14,280
also ate the stale donuts.

1035
00:51:14,363 --> 00:51:15,410
It would be things like

1036
00:51:15,656 --> 00:51:18,000
job loss, divorce,
trouble with the law,

1037
00:51:18,075 --> 00:51:20,328
multiple partners,
that kind of thing.

1038
00:51:20,411 --> 00:51:22,755
I mean, in short,
I would say that

1039
00:51:22,830 --> 00:51:24,924
the people who ate the stale
donuts were essentially...

1040
00:51:24,999 --> 00:51:26,171
Screw-ups.

1041
00:51:26,250 --> 00:51:28,344
Well, yeah, I didn't
want to say, but...

1042
00:51:28,419 --> 00:51:29,887
WINTON: Well, Violet,
congratulations.

1043
00:51:29,962 --> 00:51:31,635
And your timing couldn't
have been more perfect.

1044
00:51:31,714 --> 00:51:33,808
We've just got
the NIH funding.

1045
00:51:33,882 --> 00:51:36,681
Of course, partially due
to your excellent work.

1046
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:40,264
And this means I can
extend your postdoc.

1047
00:51:40,347 --> 00:51:41,690
Really?

1048
00:51:41,765 --> 00:51:44,143
Which means you're going to be
with us for a few more years.

1049
00:51:44,226 --> 00:51:47,605
Wow, that is fantastic.
Thank you.

1050
00:51:47,688 --> 00:51:49,656
No, thank you, Violet.

1051
00:51:50,190 --> 00:51:52,943
Yeah. I can't wait
to tell Tom.

1052
00:52:01,619 --> 00:52:03,417
TOM: Hey!
Hey!

1053
00:52:03,495 --> 00:52:06,795
Can I show you three options
for our invitation card stock?

1054
00:52:06,874 --> 00:52:07,875
You sure can.

1055
00:52:07,958 --> 00:52:11,383
I'm super excited.
Okay, we have got the...

1056
00:52:11,462 --> 00:52:12,679
I love you.

1057
00:52:13,547 --> 00:52:15,220
Aw! I love you, too.
I do.

1058
00:52:15,799 --> 00:52:18,143
Something crazy
happened today.

1059
00:52:19,386 --> 00:52:22,936
Winton called me into the
office and hinted that

1060
00:52:23,807 --> 00:52:27,152
they might be
extending my postdoc.

1061
00:52:31,482 --> 00:52:34,656
So, what does that mean
for us, exactly? Um...

1062
00:52:35,444 --> 00:52:37,867
I think what it
probably means is that

1063
00:52:37,946 --> 00:52:40,745
we would stay here just for
a little bit and then...

1064
00:52:40,824 --> 00:52:42,918
Would you like
some of this wine?

1065
00:52:42,993 --> 00:52:44,620
Nope.
No? Okay.

1066
00:52:44,828 --> 00:52:49,709
Um, I think the first phase
would be a few years,

1067
00:52:49,792 --> 00:52:52,545
and then, potentially,
if that went well,

1068
00:52:53,629 --> 00:52:54,846
for longer.

1069
00:52:55,130 --> 00:52:56,677
It sounds like
we're staying.

1070
00:53:18,112 --> 00:53:24,290
Look, I know our plans changed, but
they changed because I did well,

1071
00:53:25,035 --> 00:53:26,912
and I know it doesn't
feel like that to you,

1072
00:53:26,995 --> 00:53:29,999
but maybe it's a good
thing that they changed.

1073
00:53:32,292 --> 00:53:33,635
For you.

1074
00:53:34,628 --> 00:53:36,380
Yes, for me, but...

1075
00:53:38,716 --> 00:53:41,765
I've just worked so hard
for my whole life for this.

1076
00:53:41,844 --> 00:53:44,347
I feel like I'm
on the verge, babe.

1077
00:53:48,308 --> 00:53:51,061
And maybe it's okay
for me to be selfish.

1078
00:53:52,396 --> 00:53:54,569
Well, if it's okay
for you to be selfish,

1079
00:53:54,857 --> 00:53:57,827
I guess everyone else can just
figure it out on their own.

1080
00:53:57,901 --> 00:53:59,073
Okay, that came out wrong.

1081
00:53:59,153 --> 00:54:00,245
That came out wrong.

1082
00:54:00,320 --> 00:54:01,697
No, I think you said
exactly what you meant.

1083
00:54:02,406 --> 00:54:05,910
Academia's my life, Tom. I guess
you just don't understand.

1084
00:54:06,493 --> 00:54:08,837
(SIGHING) Can I
tell you something?

1085
00:54:08,912 --> 00:54:11,461
It makes me
feel like shit

1086
00:54:11,540 --> 00:54:13,668
when you tell me I don't
understand things.

1087
00:54:13,751 --> 00:54:15,549
Okay. No, listen, I
have news for you.

1088
00:54:15,627 --> 00:54:17,345
I do understand.

1089
00:54:17,421 --> 00:54:19,594
I understand everything,
I just don't like it.

1090
00:54:20,090 --> 00:54:22,092
Well, I'm sorry.
You're right.

1091
00:54:22,593 --> 00:54:23,845
It's just not nice.
Okay, look.

1092
00:54:23,927 --> 00:54:26,225
I'm very excited about
what happened today.

1093
00:54:26,305 --> 00:54:28,057
Do you want
to know something?

1094
00:54:28,140 --> 00:54:31,064
As soon <i>as</i> I heard the news, I felt
instantly terrified to tell you.

1095
00:54:31,685 --> 00:54:33,187
Now, there's something
wrong with that,

1096
00:54:33,270 --> 00:54:35,989
that I feel like you
can't share in this with me.

1097
00:54:36,064 --> 00:54:37,065
Even a little.

1098
00:54:38,275 --> 00:54:40,118
I'm happy for you.

1099
00:54:41,278 --> 00:54:44,157
(UNENTHUSIASTICALLY)
Yay! We get to stay here!

1100
00:54:44,239 --> 00:54:45,206
You're being a prick.

1101
00:54:45,282 --> 00:54:46,374
Then I'll just try
to be happy, too.

1102
00:54:46,450 --> 00:54:47,702
That's not being
happy for me.

1103
00:54:47,785 --> 00:54:48,786
I want you to be happy.

1104
00:54:48,869 --> 00:54:50,041
That's not being
happy for me.

1105
00:54:50,120 --> 00:54:51,372
That is martyring yourself

1106
00:54:51,455 --> 00:54:54,925
and then blaming me for your
perceived lack of success.

1107
00:54:55,793 --> 00:54:56,794
Now...

1108
00:54:57,586 --> 00:54:58,678
Now I have
a lack of success?

1109
00:54:58,796 --> 00:55:00,890
Well, I don't think you do. I
have a lack of success now?

1110
00:55:00,964 --> 00:55:04,309
But you clearly think you do
and that's the problem.

1111
00:55:04,968 --> 00:55:07,847
The fact remains, Tom, that
you work at a cool place,

1112
00:55:07,930 --> 00:55:09,898
but you refuse
to see it as that.

1113
00:55:09,973 --> 00:55:12,567
I ran a kitchen
in San Francisco,

1114
00:55:12,643 --> 00:55:13,735
Okay
okay?

1115
00:55:13,811 --> 00:55:15,563
And you have
no idea how it feels

1116
00:55:15,646 --> 00:55:17,398
to be the guy
in a relationship

1117
00:55:17,481 --> 00:55:19,199
and not have a job
that you're proud of.

1118
00:55:19,274 --> 00:55:20,400
It's embarrassing.

1119
00:55:20,484 --> 00:55:22,407
Why haven't we once
talked about the fact

1120
00:55:22,486 --> 00:55:24,363
that you are upset that
you're not running Clam Bar?

1121
00:55:24,446 --> 00:55:26,198
You never talk about it.

1122
00:55:26,281 --> 00:55:28,329
Because I'm a man, and men
and women are different.

1123
00:55:28,408 --> 00:55:30,661
(MOCKINGLY) We don't have to sit
around and talk about our feelings.

1124
00:55:33,163 --> 00:55:34,710
What?
There's nothing to say!

1125
00:55:34,790 --> 00:55:37,714
You say, "I'm upset," Tom!
You say it!

1126
00:55:37,793 --> 00:55:38,794
Fine! You want
to talk about it?

1127
00:55:38,877 --> 00:55:40,220
Yes!
I hate it here!

1128
00:55:40,295 --> 00:55:41,717
Thank you!
I hate it here!

1129
00:55:41,797 --> 00:55:43,470
Thank you for...
I think it sucks here!

1130
00:55:43,590 --> 00:55:45,388
I think it sucks my fucking dick!
Great.

1131
00:55:45,467 --> 00:55:46,514
Good for you.

1132
00:55:46,593 --> 00:55:47,594
I hate it!
I hate it here!

1133
00:55:47,678 --> 00:55:50,397
Okay, okay, okay,
but now we move forward.

1134
00:55:50,472 --> 00:55:51,894
Now what should we do?

1135
00:55:51,974 --> 00:55:54,068
Would you like to
open up a Clam Bar here?

1136
00:55:59,690 --> 00:56:03,035
You can't get
fresh clams here.

1137
00:56:05,237 --> 00:56:07,365
(EXHALING DEEPLY)
I meant it as a metaphor.

1138
00:56:08,657 --> 00:56:10,159
(MIMICKING VIOLET EXHALING)

1139
00:56:15,706 --> 00:56:17,879
You know what?
This is all very confusing.

1140
00:56:18,041 --> 00:56:21,762
And I'm clearly overwhelmed
And I've gotta be honest,

1141
00:56:21,837 --> 00:56:25,137
I think the best thing would be for
me to just be alone right now,

1142
00:56:25,215 --> 00:56:26,432
so that I can think.

1143
00:56:26,508 --> 00:56:27,634
Okay.

1144
00:56:28,385 --> 00:56:31,309
I'll just give you
some time then, shall I?

1145
00:56:31,638 --> 00:56:33,185
Well, don't go.
I mean...

1146
00:56:35,017 --> 00:56:36,769
I need you here.

1147
00:56:38,896 --> 00:56:41,240
What do you mean? You just
told me you needed time alone.

1148
00:56:41,315 --> 00:56:43,488
What do you want? I don't
know what you want.

1149
00:56:44,735 --> 00:56:46,282
I don't want you to go.
Okay.

1150
00:56:46,361 --> 00:56:48,329
I just want to be
alone with you here.

1151
00:56:51,825 --> 00:56:53,452
Can you at least lay down? Okay.

1152
00:56:53,535 --> 00:56:55,162
Like a normal
human being?

1153
00:56:58,707 --> 00:56:59,833
Do you want me just to be...
I want...

1154
00:56:59,917 --> 00:57:01,590
Okay.
I'm trying to be alone.

1155
00:57:01,668 --> 00:57:02,840
Yeah.

1156
00:57:07,215 --> 00:57:08,467
(SIGHS)

1157
00:57:15,766 --> 00:57:16,767
I'm sorry.

1158
00:57:26,151 --> 00:57:27,277
I'm sorry, too.

1159
00:57:55,889 --> 00:58:00,269
I know that things are really
complicated right now, babe.

1160
00:58:01,103 --> 00:58:03,697
I just want us
both to be happy.

1161
00:58:05,190 --> 00:58:07,568
Do you think
we could do that here?

1162
00:58:14,282 --> 00:58:15,283
No.

1163
00:58:43,812 --> 00:58:47,817
TOM: One, two, dinner.

1164
00:58:49,151 --> 00:58:50,277
Damn it!

1165
00:58:50,986 --> 00:58:51,987
I missed.

1166
00:59:04,207 --> 00:59:05,754
Is it 7:00 a.m. yet?

1167
00:59:05,834 --> 00:59:07,461
It is somewhere.
(CHUCKLES)

1168
00:59:15,218 --> 00:59:16,435
VIOLET: Cheers, everyone!

1169
00:59:16,511 --> 00:59:18,229
Cheers!
Thanks for coming.

1170
00:59:18,305 --> 00:59:20,603
It's so good to
see you guys, really.

1171
00:59:20,682 --> 00:59:23,401
Yeah. Yes, you guys, too.

1172
00:59:23,477 --> 00:59:27,448
So, here we've got some venison meat pie.
SUZIE: Mmm-hmm.

1173
00:59:27,522 --> 00:59:29,866
And in the far corner
we have some venison marrow.

1174
00:59:30,650 --> 00:59:33,620
And here we have some
forest-foraged vegetables,

1175
00:59:33,695 --> 00:59:37,074
which I foraged myself.
So, enjoy.

1176
00:59:37,157 --> 00:59:38,158
Mmm!
SUZIE: Yeah.

1177
00:59:38,241 --> 00:59:40,960
And, honestly, eat as
much <i>as</i> you guys want.

1178
00:59:41,036 --> 00:59:43,289
I have three deer
hanging in the garage.

1179
00:59:43,371 --> 00:59:45,590
So, there's plenty
of meat to go around.

1180
00:59:45,665 --> 00:59:47,212
Wow.

1181
00:59:47,292 --> 00:59:48,635
TOM: Oh, my gosh,
how rude of me.

1182
00:59:48,710 --> 00:59:50,383
Can I get anyone
some more mead?

1183
00:59:51,171 --> 00:59:52,639
I've been collecting
the honey myself.

1184
00:59:52,714 --> 00:59:55,593
Tom has become something
of an amateur beekeeper.

1185
00:59:56,384 --> 01:00:00,230
It's just at the right stage of fermentation.
(SNIFFS) Here you go.

1186
01:00:05,227 --> 01:00:06,900
Drink as much
as you like.

1187
01:00:08,271 --> 01:00:11,741
I feel like I'm drinking
out of Chewbacca's dick.

1188
01:00:16,113 --> 01:00:17,911
Oh, wow.

1189
01:00:19,241 --> 01:00:20,788
That's just honey, huh?

1190
01:00:20,867 --> 01:00:23,586
That's really...
It's hurting my teeth.

1191
01:00:26,623 --> 01:00:27,715
So, we're having a boy.

1192
01:00:27,791 --> 01:00:30,135
Oh, my God!
Yeah!

1193
01:00:30,210 --> 01:00:31,678
Congratulations!
Yeah! Thank you!

1194
01:00:31,753 --> 01:00:33,096
That is amazing news.
One of each.

1195
01:00:33,088 --> 01:00:35,261
A little prince. One of each,
so we're done, that's it.

1196
01:00:35,382 --> 01:00:36,804
Oh, I knew it!
SUZIE: So great.

1197
01:00:36,800 --> 01:00:39,553
You were boobing out when you came in.
SUZIE: Yeah.

1198
01:00:39,636 --> 01:00:40,637
Yeah.

1199
01:00:40,720 --> 01:00:42,222
That is so exciting
for you guys.

1200
01:00:42,305 --> 01:00:43,773
I couldn't be
happier for you guys.

1201
01:00:43,849 --> 01:00:44,850
Thank you.

1202
01:00:44,933 --> 01:00:47,311
I'm not sure that I ever
want to have kids.

1203
01:00:48,603 --> 01:00:49,775
What is it?

1204
01:00:50,438 --> 01:00:53,942
I thought you had always wanted kids.
That's silly.

1205
01:00:54,442 --> 01:00:58,037
You know, sometimes the biggest
balls are the ones left unused.

1206
01:00:58,113 --> 01:00:59,114
(CHUCKLES)

1207
01:01:01,116 --> 01:01:02,618
What the fuck
did you just say?

1208
01:01:03,410 --> 01:01:05,287
I don't know.
It's an expression.

1209
01:01:06,246 --> 01:01:08,624
Do you know what?
I have an idea.

1210
01:01:09,082 --> 01:01:11,380
Tom and I are going to take
care of Vanessa tonight.

1211
01:01:11,459 --> 01:01:12,460
You two are
going to go out.

1212
01:01:12,544 --> 01:01:14,888
And I will prove to you
how fun children are, okay?

1213
01:01:14,963 --> 01:01:17,057
Yes. Mmm-hmm.

1214
01:01:17,465 --> 01:01:19,388
Yeah, I don't want
Vanessa to take part

1215
01:01:19,467 --> 01:01:20,593
in one of her psychological
experiments.

1216
01:01:20,677 --> 01:01:22,270
It's not an experiment.
SUZIE: I'm fine with it.

1217
01:01:22,345 --> 01:01:24,894
Yes, I am fine doing that.
I need a night out.

1218
01:01:24,973 --> 01:01:26,395
You know what, we'll talk
about it and get back to you.

1219
01:01:26,474 --> 01:01:27,475
Done, done.
It's done. Come on.

1220
01:01:27,559 --> 01:01:28,856
SUZIE: Honey.
Honey?

1221
01:01:28,935 --> 01:01:31,108
(WHISPERING) Alex, I do.
You don't understand.

1222
01:01:31,229 --> 01:01:32,446
Honey, come on. SUZIE: I
think we're doing it.

1223
01:01:32,522 --> 01:01:34,115
He looks like a drifter.

1224
01:01:34,191 --> 01:01:35,738
SUZIE: I don't care
if he's a psycho.

1225
01:01:35,817 --> 01:01:38,115
You go out every night!
I need this.

1226
01:01:38,195 --> 01:01:39,287
Look at him.
SUZIE: I never go out.

1227
01:01:39,362 --> 01:01:40,579
I can hear you.

1228
01:01:40,655 --> 01:01:42,453
SUZIE: Do this for me.
Do this for me.

1229
01:01:42,532 --> 01:01:44,705
When we come back, she'll be
hanging on a hook in the garage.

1230
01:01:44,784 --> 01:01:46,252
SUZIE: Come on. No.
ALEX: I'm telling you.

1231
01:01:46,328 --> 01:01:47,454
SUZIE: We're doing it tonight.
Do this for me.

1232
01:01:47,537 --> 01:01:49,710
Well, it's decided,
we're going out!

1233
01:01:49,789 --> 01:01:50,836
All right!
All right.

1234
01:01:50,916 --> 01:01:52,133
SUZIE: We're doing it. Yeah.

1235
01:01:52,209 --> 01:01:53,210
It's going to be fun.

1236
01:01:53,376 --> 01:01:55,299
Put it on the other side.

1237
01:01:55,378 --> 01:01:57,756
Like that? Should we try to
make another set of steps?

1238
01:01:57,839 --> 01:01:58,806
I gotta go and pee.

1239
01:01:58,924 --> 01:02:00,847
Can you just watch her for one second?
Yeah, yeah. Of course.

1240
01:02:00,926 --> 01:02:02,178
Okay.

1241
01:02:04,846 --> 01:02:07,065
How did this
go in together?

1242
01:02:07,140 --> 01:02:09,768
TOM: I don't know, but it kind of
looks like a train, doesn't it?

1243
01:02:09,851 --> 01:02:12,024
I'm going to
put this one here.

1244
01:02:12,854 --> 01:02:14,527
This is all I need.

1245
01:02:14,814 --> 01:02:15,986
Totally.

1246
01:02:23,073 --> 01:02:24,165
(LAUGHING)

1247
01:02:25,533 --> 01:02:26,534
Tom, where's Vanessa?

1248
01:02:26,618 --> 01:02:28,120
Babe, you have
got to see this.

1249
01:02:28,203 --> 01:02:29,671
Tom, where's Vanessa?
What?

1250
01:02:29,746 --> 01:02:30,838
Where is she?

1251
01:02:32,374 --> 01:02:33,466
You have to keep
an eye on her.

1252
01:02:33,541 --> 01:02:34,588
She was literally
just right here.

1253
01:02:34,668 --> 01:02:36,762
Okay, but you got to
keep an eye, you know?

1254
01:02:36,878 --> 01:02:38,505
Okay, I'm sure she's right around here.
Vanessa?

1255
01:02:38,588 --> 01:02:41,307
Vanessa? Vanessa,
where are you?

1256
01:02:41,383 --> 01:02:42,851
Oh, my God, Tom!

1257
01:02:42,926 --> 01:02:44,269
What are you
talking about? Whoa.

1258
01:02:44,344 --> 01:02:47,143
What is your crossbow
doing on the kitchen table?

1259
01:02:47,222 --> 01:02:48,644
A crossbow doesn't
clean itself, you know.

1260
01:02:48,723 --> 01:02:50,350
What is it doing there?

1261
01:02:50,433 --> 01:02:52,026
Hey.
Yeah.

1262
01:02:52,102 --> 01:02:54,605
Why don't you... Why don't we
come back out here and play?

1263
01:02:55,355 --> 01:02:56,447
No. I'm Pocahontas.

1264
01:02:57,274 --> 01:03:00,198
(BOTH SCREAMING)
VIOLET: Oh, my God!

1265
01:03:01,861 --> 01:03:03,238
Oh, my God!

1266
01:03:03,363 --> 01:03:04,785
All right,
just get to the...

1267
01:03:04,864 --> 01:03:07,617
Oh, my God, it's in my leg!
Oh, my God, it's in my leg!

1268
01:03:07,701 --> 01:03:08,668
Oh, my God!

1269
01:03:08,743 --> 01:03:09,790
(SCREAMING)
Stay calm! Stay calm!

1270
01:03:09,869 --> 01:03:10,836
Get it out!
Get it out of my leg!

1271
01:03:10,912 --> 01:03:11,913
Get it out of my leg!
Okay! Okay!

1272
01:03:12,247 --> 01:03:13,339
I'm gonna pull it out!

1273
01:03:13,456 --> 01:03:14,548
No, no, no,
don't pull it out!

1274
01:03:14,624 --> 01:03:15,625
That'll ruin the meat.

1275
01:03:15,709 --> 01:03:17,131
It's not meat,
it's my leg!

1276
01:03:17,210 --> 01:03:18,553
I got it! Stay calm!
Get it out!

1277
01:03:18,795 --> 01:03:20,047
(SCREAMING)

1278
01:03:21,548 --> 01:03:22,891
That's really in there.
Oh, shit.

1279
01:03:24,050 --> 01:03:25,802
Oh, my God!

1280
01:03:26,219 --> 01:03:27,516
My God.
Ugh!

1281
01:03:27,595 --> 01:03:28,642
Just put pressure on it.

1282
01:03:28,722 --> 01:03:29,723
What happened?

1283
01:03:29,806 --> 01:03:31,774
She shot me
with a crossbow.

1284
01:03:32,892 --> 01:03:34,018
What?

1285
01:03:34,811 --> 01:03:36,905
I want to punch you in the face right now.
Do you understand that?

1286
01:03:36,980 --> 01:03:38,277
I think we should
all just...

1287
01:03:38,356 --> 01:03:40,279
My sister had an arrow
in her leg tonight, Tom!

1288
01:03:40,358 --> 01:03:42,531
It's not an arrow,
it's a bolt.

1289
01:03:42,610 --> 01:03:46,160
ALEX: Well, I guess we were totally wrong!
It's a bolt!

1290
01:03:46,239 --> 01:03:48,333
Oh, you're right. You know what,
we're in the wrong, here.

1291
01:03:48,408 --> 01:03:52,038
My daughter didn't just witness
herself nearly murdering her aunt!

1292
01:03:52,120 --> 01:03:53,667
There was blood
all over the place!

1293
01:03:53,747 --> 01:03:56,796
She's up there freaking out right now!
She shit her pants!

1294
01:03:57,417 --> 01:03:59,840
She hasn't shit her pants
in two or three months

1295
01:03:59,919 --> 01:04:01,796
and now she's up there,
shitting her pants!

1296
01:04:01,880 --> 01:04:04,929
She feels responsible for
injuring her aunt, who she loves!

1297
01:04:05,091 --> 01:04:07,389
You understand what
that does to a kid?

1298
01:04:07,469 --> 01:04:09,938
You don't! And you don't even give...
You don't care.

1299
01:04:10,388 --> 01:04:11,765
It's a good thing you don't
want to be a father,

1300
01:04:11,848 --> 01:04:13,316
because you'd be
a terrible father.

1301
01:04:13,767 --> 01:04:17,817
And I don't like this. I don't
like this new "Lamb Chop" Tom!

1302
01:04:18,813 --> 01:04:21,942
You lost it, bro. Tether's
cut, you're in orbit.

1303
01:04:22,442 --> 01:04:24,069
You're out there.

1304
01:04:24,986 --> 01:04:27,205
God! I'm so sorry!

1305
01:04:28,281 --> 01:04:31,125
I'm sorry, but please
don't be so upset.

1306
01:04:31,618 --> 01:04:32,961
At least nobody died.

1307
01:04:39,250 --> 01:04:41,378
PRIEST: And Grandpa Baba's
last words were,

1308
01:04:41,461 --> 01:04:43,589
"I can't wait until
Violet's wedding."

1309
01:04:53,598 --> 01:04:55,521
Okay, babe, I gotta go.
I'm really late.

1310
01:04:55,600 --> 01:04:58,524
Okay. Mmm. Donuts. Are
you going to eat these?

1311
01:04:58,603 --> 01:05:00,105
No, but those are old.

1312
01:05:00,188 --> 01:05:02,031
And if you want to
just wait for a minute,

1313
01:05:02,107 --> 01:05:03,859
I'll be back with
some fresh ones.

1314
01:05:04,818 --> 01:05:05,944
Mmm!

1315
01:05:08,488 --> 01:05:11,662
These are fine. I didn't
have to wait at all.

1316
01:05:14,494 --> 01:05:16,167
Are you going
to get dressed today?

1317
01:05:16,996 --> 01:05:19,124
I think today is
more of a bunny day.

1318
01:05:19,499 --> 01:05:20,671
Yeah.

1319
01:05:24,754 --> 01:05:26,552
(PEOPLE TOASTING LOUDLY)

1320
01:05:31,469 --> 01:05:33,221
I have to say something.
I have to say something.

1321
01:05:33,304 --> 01:05:35,648
I just have to be, just for real.
I love you guys.

1322
01:05:35,723 --> 01:05:37,475
ALL: Aw!
I love you guys.

1323
01:05:37,559 --> 01:05:40,108
This is a fucking great
department, all of you guys.

1324
01:05:40,186 --> 01:05:42,439
You guys are
the best co-workers.

1325
01:05:42,522 --> 01:05:45,901
Except Ming, I don't know. I
just don't think you respect me.

1326
01:05:45,984 --> 01:05:48,282
I don't think that
you've ever respected me.

1327
01:05:48,361 --> 01:05:50,238
And I'm just not feeling it,
and I had to be honest.

1328
01:05:50,321 --> 01:05:52,699
But to everyone else, to us!
VIOLET: Yeah!

1329
01:05:53,658 --> 01:05:54,705
Whoo!

1330
01:05:55,201 --> 01:05:56,327
To everyone except Ming.

1331
01:05:56,411 --> 01:05:57,958
DOUG: Except for Ming.
VIOLET: Sorry, Ming.

1332
01:05:58,037 --> 01:05:59,084
DOUG: Oh, wow.

1333
01:05:59,164 --> 01:06:02,509
I want to give a toast.
I love all of you so much.

1334
01:06:03,168 --> 01:06:06,638
You're my best friends. The best
friends anybody could ever ask for.

1335
01:06:06,713 --> 01:06:10,013
Except for you, Vaneetha.
I don't like you.

1336
01:06:10,091 --> 01:06:12,685
I don't like you.
You're a bitch.

1337
01:06:12,760 --> 01:06:15,479
But I love all
of you so much!

1338
01:06:16,181 --> 01:06:17,728
I love all of you.

1339
01:06:18,349 --> 01:06:19,475
You're the best!
DOUG: All right.

1340
01:06:19,559 --> 01:06:22,062
Except for Vaneetha,
you're the best!

1341
01:06:22,562 --> 01:06:23,779
Calm down, Ming.

1342
01:06:23,938 --> 01:06:25,190
She's <i>a</i> bitch.

1343
01:06:25,440 --> 01:06:26,657
(MING LAUGHING)

1344
01:06:26,858 --> 01:06:28,326
(ALARM RINGING)

1345
01:06:43,374 --> 01:06:45,001
Listen, what
I want to know is,

1346
01:06:45,084 --> 01:06:48,338
why are professors in movies
always writing stuff,

1347
01:06:48,421 --> 01:06:50,173
equations and stuff,
on windows?

1348
01:06:50,256 --> 01:06:51,508
I don't know.
I don't get it.

1349
01:06:51,591 --> 01:06:52,843
I don't get it, either.
I don't understand it.

1350
01:06:52,926 --> 01:06:55,520
I don't get the fact that my
fiancé behaves like a freak.

1351
01:06:55,595 --> 01:06:57,848
These are not
things that I know.

1352
01:06:57,931 --> 01:07:00,730
I mean, surely, you know,
in a university

1353
01:07:00,808 --> 01:07:03,903
you wouldn't be far
from a pen and paper,

1354
01:07:03,978 --> 01:07:06,527
or a computer,
or an overhead projector...

1355
01:07:06,606 --> 01:07:08,449
I feel like you're
not listening to me.

1356
01:07:08,525 --> 01:07:09,868
I feel like
you're not listening.

1357
01:07:09,943 --> 01:07:14,540
I'm trying to offload and
tell you my issues with Tom.

1358
01:07:14,614 --> 01:07:17,333
Oh, shut up, will you?
Put a sock in it.

1359
01:07:17,408 --> 01:07:20,537
Why? I'm coming
to you as a friend.

1360
01:07:20,620 --> 01:07:21,997
You're wallowing.
No, I'm not.

1361
01:07:22,080 --> 01:07:23,206
Yes, you are.
I'm not wallowing.

1362
01:07:23,289 --> 01:07:24,256
You are wallowing.

1363
01:07:24,332 --> 01:07:27,085
What do you know? You don't know
anything about relationships.

1364
01:07:27,168 --> 01:07:28,545
Well, all right,
I'll take that.

1365
01:07:28,628 --> 01:07:30,221
When I'm in a relationship,

1366
01:07:30,296 --> 01:07:33,846
I'm a complete and
utter control freak.

1367
01:07:33,967 --> 01:07:35,890
Are you really? Are you really, though?
But that's not what...

1368
01:07:35,969 --> 01:07:37,767
It doesn't matter.
I'm surprised.

1369
01:07:37,845 --> 01:07:41,099
What we're talking about
now is your wallowing.

1370
01:07:41,182 --> 01:07:42,274
I'm not wallowing.

1371
01:07:42,350 --> 01:07:43,693
I was just trying
to tell you that

1372
01:07:43,768 --> 01:07:45,020
I needed something
different tonight,

1373
01:07:45,103 --> 01:07:46,275
and that's it.

1374
01:07:51,192 --> 01:07:52,819
Okay, here it comes.

1375
01:07:55,321 --> 01:07:56,447
Mmm-hmm, mmm-hmm.

1376
01:07:56,531 --> 01:07:59,000
Okay, shut up, shut up, shut up.
This is amazing.

1377
01:08:00,827 --> 01:08:01,874
Mmm!

1378
01:08:01,953 --> 01:08:03,751
No! No, no, no.

1379
01:08:03,830 --> 01:08:07,255
What were we thinking? I mean, I
was wrong, obviously. Totally.

1380
01:08:07,333 --> 01:08:09,210
I'm with Tom.
Yeah.

1381
01:08:09,294 --> 01:08:10,420
I'm taken.
I know.

1382
01:08:10,503 --> 01:08:12,301
I'm with Tom.
I apologize.

1383
01:08:12,380 --> 01:08:13,677
I'm going to go find Tom.
I know that.

1384
01:08:13,798 --> 01:08:16,426
It was a friend kissing a friend.
This was bad.

1385
01:08:16,509 --> 01:08:18,637
I kissed you
and you kissed

1386
01:08:19,345 --> 01:08:20,562
your boss.

1387
01:08:22,140 --> 01:08:23,312
Who are you texting?

1388
01:08:23,391 --> 01:08:24,688
I'm texting myself.

1389
01:08:24,767 --> 01:08:25,768
Yourself?

1390
01:08:25,852 --> 01:08:28,856
I am very drunk and I
will not remember this.

1391
01:08:31,065 --> 01:08:32,408
Hey, Tom!

1392
01:08:33,568 --> 01:08:34,615
Hey!

1393
01:08:39,741 --> 01:08:41,118
Hey, babe.
Hey.

1394
01:08:42,869 --> 01:08:43,995
I've been looking for you.

1395
01:08:44,078 --> 01:08:45,170
You're drunk, sweetie.

1396
01:08:45,246 --> 01:08:46,293
No, I'm not.

1397
01:08:46,372 --> 01:08:47,749
And you didn't
come home last night.

1398
01:08:47,832 --> 01:08:51,427
VIOLET: I know, because I've been
thinking about stuff, and I just...

1399
01:08:51,502 --> 01:08:52,628
What have you
been thinking?

1400
01:08:52,712 --> 01:08:56,057
I love you,
and you love me.

1401
01:08:56,716 --> 01:08:59,139
And I just think that,
why on Earth

1402
01:08:59,218 --> 01:09:00,470
would we put it
off any longer?

1403
01:09:00,553 --> 01:09:01,679
Because... I'll tell
you why we put it off.

1404
01:09:01,763 --> 01:09:05,017
Because we both decided
we had too many problems

1405
01:09:05,099 --> 01:09:08,729
and we were going to put the wedding
off until things got better.

1406
01:09:08,811 --> 01:09:12,987
<i>Which was dumb as balls.
That was so dumb, Tom.</i>

1407
01:09:13,066 --> 01:09:15,945
And I have been dumb,
saying that.

1408
01:09:16,694 --> 01:09:19,743
Please, I just want
to marry you, Tom.

1409
01:09:23,076 --> 01:09:24,419
Please?

1410
01:09:26,037 --> 01:09:27,380
Are you serious?
Yeah.

1411
01:09:27,955 --> 01:09:30,834
I'm so serious. I don't
know what we've been doing.

1412
01:09:30,917 --> 01:09:34,842
I have no idea why we've been
putting it off and waiting

1413
01:09:34,921 --> 01:09:36,844
and shifting
and this and that,

1414
01:09:36,923 --> 01:09:38,766
and dicking around.
It's like...

1415
01:09:38,925 --> 01:09:43,101
I just love you so much.
Madly.

1416
01:09:43,596 --> 01:09:46,349
So badly, Tom.
I just want to...

1417
01:09:47,100 --> 01:09:49,603
I just want
to get married.

TARQUIN: Yeah,
that's super sanitary.

1419
01:10:01,656 --> 01:10:04,500
You're making boner
impressions in the dough.

to puke?

1422

Oh, shit.

1423
01:10:15,795 --> 01:10:17,968
Did you just
fucking eat it?

1424
01:10:18,798 --> 01:10:20,926
TOM: (CHUCKLING)
Baby, did you eat it?

1425
01:10:21,008 --> 01:10:22,055
Ugh.

1426
01:10:22,135 --> 01:10:23,978
That's disgusting.

1427

(RETCHING)

1428
01:10:32,145 --> 01:10:33,397
VIOLET: Sorry.

1429
01:10:33,771 --> 01:10:35,023
I'm cool.

(RETCHING)

1431
01:10:37,275 --> 01:10:38,618
Sorry, Tarquin.

1432
01:10:39,694 --> 01:10:43,324
You know, that would have been way less
gross if you'd just puked everywhere.

1433
01:10:44,115 --> 01:10:47,415
All we have available that
weekend is our accordionist.

1434
01:10:48,244 --> 01:10:50,246
I love accordion. Great.
Me, too.

1435
01:10:50,413 --> 01:10:53,667
The Chos never made it to the altar,
so you can have this one for cheap.

1436
01:10:53,750 --> 01:10:55,002
Awesome.
Great.

1437
01:10:55,084 --> 01:10:58,213
And if you don't have a venue, my
brother Randy has a barbeque joint.

1438
01:10:58,296 --> 01:10:59,297
It's pretty killer.

1439
01:10:59,547 --> 01:11:01,299
Oh, sweet.
Perfect.

1440
01:11:01,382 --> 01:11:02,554
What does that say?

1441
01:11:02,717 --> 01:11:06,767
Yeah, it <i>says,</i>
"I don't read Korean."

1442
01:11:07,930 --> 01:11:09,523
All right,
I was just asking.

1443
01:11:09,599 --> 01:11:11,021
I'm just telling you.

1444
01:11:14,604 --> 01:11:15,901
I-46.

1445
01:11:15,980 --> 01:11:17,072
What do you think?

1446
01:11:17,148 --> 01:11:18,991
I think I love it.

1447
01:11:19,066 --> 01:11:21,694
Should we just book this place for
the rehearsal dinner as well?

1448
01:11:21,778 --> 01:11:22,779
Yes.
Great.

1449
01:11:22,862 --> 01:11:23,863
Done.
Done.

1450
01:11:23,946 --> 01:11:26,074
Sounds great to me.

Hi.
Hello.

01:11:30,203 --> 01:11:31,204
Hello.

1453
01:11:31,287 --> 01:11:33,836
We were wondering,
do you do weddings?

1454
01:11:33,915 --> 01:11:35,667
You both Jewish?

1455
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:37,126
Yeah.

01:11:37,460 --> 01:11:38,461
Mmm!

01:11:44,467 --> 01:11:45,889
I'm so excited
for tomorrow night.

1458
01:11:45,968 --> 01:11:47,686
Yeah.
Our rehearsal dinner.

1459
01:11:48,805 --> 01:11:51,979
I can't believe it.
It's finally here.

1460
01:11:55,978 --> 01:11:57,195
What's going on?

1461
01:11:57,271 --> 01:11:58,488
Nothing. Nada.

1462
01:11:58,981 --> 01:12:00,824
Something. What's up?

1463
01:12:01,609 --> 01:12:03,156
Winton kissed me.

1464
01:12:06,113 --> 01:12:08,332
What?
It meant nothing.

1465
01:12:09,492 --> 01:12:10,539
When?

1466
01:12:10,701 --> 01:12:12,419
<i>It was a few weeks ago.</i>

1467
01:12:12,495 --> 01:12:15,874
He was drunk and he didn't
mean what he was doing, Tom.

1468
01:12:16,040 --> 01:12:17,963
It was a stupid mistake.

1469
01:12:18,125 --> 01:12:19,547
He was drunk.

1470
01:12:19,627 --> 01:12:21,220
He's not coming
tomorrow night.

1471
01:12:21,295 --> 01:12:23,343
No, he's not.
I will tell him that.

1472
01:12:25,383 --> 01:12:27,852
This will never,
ever happen again.

1473
01:12:28,469 --> 01:12:29,812
I promise.

1474
01:12:30,054 --> 01:12:32,056
(SIGHS) I really wish you
hadn't told me that.

1475

Yes.

1479
01:12:51,158 --> 01:12:52,910
It's going to happen.

No.
He kissed me, Tom!

1486
01:13:35,578 --> 01:13:37,421
Okay, you know what'?
That is a cop out.

1487
01:13:37,580 --> 01:13:39,378
That is not fair.

1488
01:13:39,457 --> 01:13:42,210
Yes, he may have been
the one who kissed you,

1489
01:13:42,376 --> 01:13:46,176
but there is a reason that he
felt like that was an option.

Okay, no, you want to know something?
For the record,

I did fake that orgasm.

1873
01:35:12,498 --> 01:35:16,048
I am not the type of person
who wants to sit around

1874
01:35:16,127 --> 01:35:19,006
and wait for something
that might never arrive

1875
01:35:19,088 --> 01:35:22,763
when they know that the thing
they have in front of them is...

1876
01:35:22,926 --> 01:35:23,973
It's tasty!

1877
01:35:24,052 --> 01:35:27,397
<i>It's good, okay?
And you know what?</i>

1878
01:35:27,597 --> 01:35:31,898
It's not about the age of the
donut, it's about the flavor. Boom.

1879
01:35:32,644 --> 01:35:36,490
<i>And you know the other thing?
The new donuts,</i>

1880
01:35:36,564 --> 01:35:38,783
<i>they're going to get
stale someday, too.</i>

1881
01:35:38,858 --> 01:35:41,077
And this is exactly

1882
01:35:41,694 --> 01:35:44,618
what I did not want to happen
when I sent that email.

1883
01:35:44,697 --> 01:35:46,244
<i>I think I should just go.</i>

1884
01:35:46,324 --> 01:35:48,577
Yeah, no.
Yeah, you should go.

1885
01:35:49,494 --> 01:35:51,872
You're clearly
very upset and...

1886
01:35:51,955 --> 01:35:53,582
<i>I don't even know
what I said.</i>

1887
01:35:53,831 --> 01:35:55,674
Everything just turned red.

1888
01:35:55,833 --> 01:35:57,631
<i>It's so hot back here.</i>

1889
01:35:58,294 --> 01:36:00,888
It's why people are always
fighting in the Middle East.

1890
01:36:01,047 --> 01:36:03,425
It's just, you get so hot.

1891
01:36:04,509 --> 01:36:05,601
<i>Tom,</i>

1892
01:36:06,761 --> 01:36:08,013
I'm going to go, okay?

1893
01:36:08,096 --> 01:36:09,313
Yeah.

1894
01:36:10,265 --> 01:36:11,938
Happy birthday.

1895
01:36:12,100 --> 01:36:13,226
Okay.

1896
01:36:15,728 --> 01:36:16,945
Bye.

1897
01:36:18,481 --> 01:36:19,778
Goodbye.

1898
01:36:28,324 --> 01:36:30,452
(LAUGHING) ls somebody crying?

1899
01:36:34,664 --> 01:36:35,881
Sorry.

1900
01:36:36,791 --> 01:36:38,543
Dude, what's up?

1901
01:36:39,877 --> 01:36:41,629
I don't know what
I'm doing, dude.

1902
01:36:42,422 --> 01:36:46,393
I just got off the phone with Violet.
And I just feel fucking...

1903
01:36:47,635 --> 01:36:48,932
I don't know.

1904
01:36:49,846 --> 01:36:50,893
(SIGHS)

1905
01:36:50,972 --> 01:36:53,350
I don't know how
I ended up here.

1906
01:36:54,267 --> 01:36:55,769
Can I be honest with you?

1907
01:36:56,311 --> 01:36:59,440
You shouldn't be here
working in my restaurant, man.

1908
01:36:59,856 --> 01:37:02,405
You should be running
your own restaurant.

1909
01:37:02,650 --> 01:37:04,994
You're a better chef than me,
you always have been.

1910
01:37:05,069 --> 01:37:07,037
Everybody here knows it.

1911
01:37:09,407 --> 01:37:11,375
Tom, you're fired.

1912
01:37:12,577 --> 01:37:14,170
I'm firing you.

1913
01:37:16,748 --> 01:37:18,625
Pack your knives and go.
(LAUGHS)

1914
01:37:19,834 --> 01:37:20,926
That's Top Chef.

1915
01:37:21,085 --> 01:37:22,883
Yeah, that's Top Chef.
(CHUCKLES) Yeah.

1916
01:37:23,963 --> 01:37:26,842
Seeing you chop
onions is depressing.

1917
01:37:26,924 --> 01:37:29,143
It's like watching
Michael Jordan take a shit.

1918
01:37:30,345 --> 01:37:32,393
He could probably get it in the
toilet from, like, 30 feet away.

1919
01:37:32,472 --> 01:37:33,473
(LAUGHING UNCONTROLLABLY)

1920
01:37:33,556 --> 01:37:35,604
Three-pointer
from the living room.

1921
01:37:35,683 --> 01:37:37,526
Nothing but porcelain.

1922
01:37:38,478 --> 01:37:39,695
Poosh.

1923
01:37:41,647 --> 01:37:43,274
Poosh.
Poosh.

1924
01:37:43,649 --> 01:37:47,199
I think about 13 miles to the
gallon, city, 15, highway.

1925
01:37:47,570 --> 01:37:50,198
There's a bit of
blood spatter in the back.

1926
01:37:50,281 --> 01:37:51,533
I think it's haunted.

1927
01:37:52,367 --> 01:37:54,085
Great crash rating, though.

1928
01:37:54,786 --> 01:37:56,914
So, what are you
going to be using it for?

1929
01:37:57,872 --> 01:37:59,340
Food service.

1930
01:38:01,459 --> 01:38:02,961
Oh, buddy.

1931
01:38:13,930 --> 01:38:16,809
TOM: All right, we're going
to need two more venison.

1932
01:38:17,934 --> 01:38:19,436
Sorry for the holdup,
everybody.

1933
01:38:19,519 --> 01:38:21,647
How's my taco coming?
We good?

1934
01:38:21,729 --> 01:38:22,730
Let's get it.

1935
01:38:23,231 --> 01:38:25,700
Thanks, I'll see you tomorrow?
All right.

1936
01:38:25,775 --> 01:38:28,278
I just want you to know,
I've had tacos in Oahu.

1937
01:38:28,361 --> 01:38:29,658
I've had tacos in Baja.

1938
01:38:29,737 --> 01:38:31,239
I've had tacos
in Port-au-Prince.

1939
01:38:31,364 --> 01:38:32,866
I've had tacos
in Buenos Aires.

1940
01:38:32,949 --> 01:38:34,872
I've even had
tacos in Guatemala.

1941
01:38:34,951 --> 01:38:37,795
These are the best motherfucking
tacos I have ever had.

1942
01:38:37,870 --> 01:38:40,248
You're a white guy.
You make tacos like a Mexican.

1943
01:38:40,957 --> 01:38:41,958
Thanks.

1944
01:38:42,250 --> 01:38:43,376
Give me a hug.

1945
01:38:43,960 --> 01:38:44,961
Oh, really?

1946
01:38:45,044 --> 01:38:47,012
Give me a hug, now!

1947
01:38:47,171 --> 01:38:48,764
All right.

1948
01:38:49,006 --> 01:38:51,134
Mmm! You smell like a taco.

1949
01:38:51,843 --> 01:38:54,096
Okay, can we get
those tacos ready?

1950
01:38:54,762 --> 01:38:57,732
As you know, we have a sufficiency
of qualified candidates

1951
01:38:57,807 --> 01:39:00,230
for a position in
your department,

1952
01:39:00,309 --> 01:39:02,778
but you got it.
Congratulations.

1953
01:39:03,396 --> 01:39:08,027
You're being promoted to assistant
professor, tenure track. Congratulations.

1954
01:39:08,109 --> 01:39:09,656
Holy shit!

1955
01:39:09,735 --> 01:39:10,987
(LAUGHING)

1956
01:39:11,779 --> 01:39:15,454
Sorry, that was really
inappropriate, it's just...

1957
01:39:17,160 --> 01:39:19,834
Shoot, I am so thrilled.
Thank you.

1958
01:39:19,996 --> 01:39:21,873
Congratulations.
Professor Walch.

1959
01:39:21,956 --> 01:39:24,050
Bravo, bravo.
Thank you, Professor.

1960
01:39:24,125 --> 01:39:25,342
Fudge.

1961
01:39:27,044 --> 01:39:28,136
Wonderful.

1962
01:39:34,635 --> 01:39:35,636
Doug?

1963
01:39:36,387 --> 01:39:37,559
Hey.

1964
01:39:37,638 --> 01:39:39,265
Heard your news.
Congratulations.

1965
01:39:39,348 --> 01:39:40,725
Thanks.
Yeah.

1966
01:39:41,142 --> 01:39:42,143
Where are you going?

1967
01:39:42,477 --> 01:39:45,651
Uh... On my way to
University of North Dakota.

1968
01:39:46,606 --> 01:39:49,155
Oh! Well, that's good.

1969
01:39:49,233 --> 01:39:51,702
Yeah. No, no, it's great.
I'm excited.

1970
01:39:51,903 --> 01:39:53,246
I'm going to be a pioneer.

1971
01:39:53,321 --> 01:39:55,915
I'm going to be the first
black guy to freeze to death.

1972
01:39:56,073 --> 01:39:58,246
It's going to be cool.
Yeah, I'm pumped up about it.

1973
01:39:58,326 --> 01:39:59,327
Cool.
Yeah.

1974
01:39:59,410 --> 01:40:02,004
It's just like that song.
I get knocked down,

1975
01:40:02,079 --> 01:40:04,548
except I get up
again in North Dakota,

1976
01:40:04,624 --> 01:40:06,217
which is the worst
place on Earth.

1977
01:40:06,584 --> 01:40:08,052
I'm sorry.

1978
01:40:08,127 --> 01:40:09,754
You know what? I'm overreacting.
It's going to be great.

1979
01:40:09,921 --> 01:40:13,050
And I couldn't keep up with you and Winton.
I couldn't compete, so...

1980
01:40:13,257 --> 01:40:15,351
(SCOFFS)
What do you mean by that?

1981
01:40:16,761 --> 01:40:18,434
I mean, come on,
you know what I mean.

1982
01:40:19,222 --> 01:40:20,223
I don't.

1983
01:40:20,848 --> 01:40:22,020
You know what I mean.

1984
01:40:23,351 --> 01:40:26,195
Yeah, well, it's not
really like that.

1985
01:40:27,355 --> 01:40:29,403
Uh... No, it's a fact.

1986
01:40:30,858 --> 01:40:33,407
Yeah, well, that's not
why I got the...

1987
01:40:34,028 --> 01:40:35,280
Ah. A little bit.

1988
01:40:36,030 --> 01:40:37,031
Okay.

1989
01:40:44,247 --> 01:40:45,294
VIOLET: Hey.

1990
01:40:45,373 --> 01:40:47,467
Hey. Here she is.

1991
01:40:52,713 --> 01:40:54,056
<i>So, congratulations.</i>

1992
01:40:54,131 --> 01:40:55,132
<i>Thank you.</i>

1993
01:40:55,383 --> 01:40:57,977
She got the job? Motherfucker!
Shh!

1994
01:40:58,052 --> 01:40:59,770
It's very exciting.

1995
01:41:02,265 --> 01:41:04,188
How long do you think
I have to decide,

1996
01:41:04,267 --> 01:41:06,065
you know, whether
to take it or not?

1997
01:41:06,769 --> 01:41:08,442
Sorry, I don't
understand the question.

1998
01:41:08,604 --> 01:41:09,821
Oh, the position.

1999
01:41:09,897 --> 01:41:11,319
I'm just wondering how
long I've got to decide

2000
01:41:11,399 --> 01:41:13,322
on whether
I should take it.

2001
01:41:13,401 --> 01:41:15,995
Well, you have to take it.
You've got no choice.

2002
01:41:17,321 --> 01:41:18,789
Can I ask you something?

2003
01:41:18,990 --> 01:41:19,991
Yeah.

2004
01:41:20,241 --> 01:41:22,039
Did I get the job
because I deserved it

2005
01:41:22,118 --> 01:41:23,961
or did I get it because you're
trying to keep me here?

2006
01:41:24,245 --> 01:41:25,918
You got it because
you deserved it.

2007
01:41:25,997 --> 01:41:28,841
Okay. So, I was
the strongest candidate.

2008
01:41:28,916 --> 01:41:29,963
Of course you were.

2009
01:41:30,251 --> 01:41:31,673
Okay, we should
not be watching this.

2010
01:41:31,752 --> 01:41:33,095
You're right,
we shouldn't.

2011
01:41:33,170 --> 01:41:35,764
<i>WINTON: I mean, these things
are inherently subjective,</i>

2012
01:41:35,923 --> 01:41:38,267
but I certainly feel that
we made the right choice, yes.

2013
01:41:38,634 --> 01:41:40,636
I think I just need
you to say "yes" or "no"

2014
01:41:40,720 --> 01:41:42,814
as to whether I was
the strongest candidate.

2015
01:41:42,888 --> 01:41:45,186
Well, why does it
matter so much?

2016
01:41:45,266 --> 01:41:48,065
Because it matters to me. You know,
I want to deserve to be here.

2017
01:41:48,144 --> 01:41:49,270
Was I the best?

2018
01:41:49,437 --> 01:41:51,815
Who's to say who's
the best or the worst?

2019
01:41:51,981 --> 01:41:53,358
I'm better than she is.

2020
01:41:53,441 --> 01:41:55,944
No, you're not. It goes
Violet, me, you, then Doug.

2021
01:41:56,027 --> 01:41:58,655
<i>What do these
labels even mean?</i>

2022
01:41:59,030 --> 01:42:01,624
Look, just answer me.
Did I deserve the job

2023
01:42:01,699 --> 01:42:03,576
or did I get it because you're
trying to keep me here?

2024
01:42:03,659 --> 01:42:04,956
It's very simple, Winton.

2025
01:42:05,328 --> 01:42:07,080
Violet, why don't
you trust me?

2026
01:42:07,163 --> 01:42:09,291
If you make me answer
that question,

2027
01:42:09,373 --> 01:42:11,876
you're violating our
unspoken agreement of faith.

2028
01:42:12,084 --> 01:42:13,210
What does that mean?
What are you talking about?

2029
01:42:13,294 --> 01:42:15,137
Well, the question
itself is an accusation.

2030
01:42:15,212 --> 01:42:19,058
And I, personally, refuse to
answer an illogical question.

2031
01:42:19,717 --> 01:42:20,889
Thanks, Spock.

2032
01:42:20,968 --> 01:42:22,060
Spock.

2033
01:42:22,136 --> 01:42:23,888
That's a good one. Yeah.
That's a good one.

2034
01:42:23,971 --> 01:42:26,815
I mean, it seems that your refusal
to answer means that it's true.

2035
01:42:27,308 --> 01:42:29,151
I'll tell you who's the best.

2036
01:42:35,483 --> 01:42:36,450
Ming.

2037
01:42:36,525 --> 01:42:37,993
Yes! I knew it.

2038
01:42:38,194 --> 01:42:39,366
(IN SING-SONG) I'm the
best, I'm the best.

2039
01:42:39,445 --> 01:42:41,368
What the fuck?

2040
01:42:41,822 --> 01:42:43,244
Ming is the best.

2041
01:42:43,324 --> 01:42:44,951
<i>VIOLET: So, you cheated
to get me the job.</i>

2042
01:42:45,034 --> 01:42:48,755
So what if I cheated to get the
woman I love to stick around?

2043
01:42:48,829 --> 01:42:49,921
I have a question.

2044
01:42:49,997 --> 01:42:51,920
Would you have even considered
my donut experiment

2045
01:42:51,999 --> 01:42:53,171
if Doug had suggested it?

2046
01:42:53,542 --> 01:42:54,589
Of course not.

2047
01:42:54,752 --> 01:42:55,844
(SCOFFING)

2048
01:42:55,920 --> 01:42:56,967
WOW!

2049
01:42:58,172 --> 01:42:59,890
Wow.
Okay.

2050
01:43:02,259 --> 01:43:04,307
In a way, Ming, it's like
their whole relationship

2051
01:43:04,387 --> 01:43:06,435
was the donut experiment.

2052
01:43:06,514 --> 01:43:08,016
Nice.
Thank you.

2053
01:43:08,391 --> 01:43:10,018
Fine, fine, fine.

2054
01:43:12,019 --> 01:43:14,613
There will be new
students next year.

2055
01:43:14,689 --> 01:43:16,066
There's always a new Violet.

2056
01:43:17,733 --> 01:43:19,280
Oh, no!
Oh!

2057
01:43:19,360 --> 01:43:20,737
VANEETHA: He did not.

2058
01:43:20,861 --> 01:43:21,862
Um...
Oh.

2059
01:43:21,946 --> 01:43:24,449
This was...
Yeah.

2060
01:43:24,532 --> 01:43:25,624
Oh, my God!

2061
01:43:25,700 --> 01:43:28,374
<i>VANEETHA: Turn off the light. Turn
off the light, turn off the light.</i>

2062
01:43:29,704 --> 01:43:31,001
Violet.

2063
01:44:21,589 --> 01:44:24,138
These pancakes are delicious.
Mmm.

2064
01:44:24,508 --> 01:44:27,182
They put a cinnamon glaze.
They're dreamy.

2065
01:44:27,261 --> 01:44:28,387
You shouldn't
be eating them.

2066
01:44:28,471 --> 01:44:29,518
It's good.

2067
01:44:29,597 --> 01:44:32,225
It's why we're here.
We're here to eat, right?

2068
01:44:32,308 --> 01:44:33,355
So, um,

2069
01:44:34,727 --> 01:44:37,276
how about Violet?
How is she doing?

2070
01:44:37,813 --> 01:44:39,781
I don't know. You know?

2071
01:44:39,857 --> 01:44:41,609
She still with
that professor guy?

2072
01:44:41,692 --> 01:44:43,444
I don't know.

2073
01:44:43,527 --> 01:44:45,200
CAROL: What are you doing?

2074
01:44:45,279 --> 01:44:46,781
What are you doing, Tom?

2075
01:44:47,281 --> 01:44:49,454
I'm just... I'm trying
to eat my breakfast, Ma.

2076
01:44:49,533 --> 01:44:53,254
I mean with Violet, and you know it.
Three grandparents are gone.

2077
01:44:53,329 --> 01:44:57,050
Your grandparents, long gone. You
know who goes next, don't you?

2078
01:44:57,124 --> 01:44:59,172
Us. We go next.
Jesus, Dad.

2079
01:44:59,251 --> 01:45:01,049
Please don't do this, guys.

2080
01:45:01,128 --> 01:45:02,880
He's not kidding.
Not kidding.

2081
01:45:02,963 --> 01:45:04,636
He's on three different
heart medications.

2082
01:45:04,715 --> 01:45:06,308
That's right. Three of them.
Mmm-hmm.

2083
01:45:06,383 --> 01:45:08,385
What are you talking about?
Since when?

2084
01:45:08,469 --> 01:45:10,016
Since my last
heart attack.

2085
01:45:10,846 --> 01:45:13,065
Dad, you had a heart attack?
(SIGHS)

2086
01:45:13,140 --> 01:45:14,733
I had two, actually.

2087
01:45:14,809 --> 01:45:17,528
The last one was right
after Mom's cancer scare.

2088
01:45:17,978 --> 01:45:19,480
A cancer scare?
What are you...

2089
01:45:19,647 --> 01:45:21,775
Why didn't you guys
tell me any of this?

2090
01:45:21,857 --> 01:45:23,655
PETE: Well, we didn't
want to bother you.

2091
01:45:23,734 --> 01:45:25,782
No. It wasn't your affair.

2092
01:45:26,111 --> 01:45:28,864
Well, is there anything else
you guys haven't told me?

2093
01:45:28,948 --> 01:45:30,245
Well, what else have we...

2094
01:45:30,324 --> 01:45:32,577
There's a lot we haven't told you, darling.
We don't share everything.

2095
01:45:32,660 --> 01:45:33,627
Your mother was...

2096
01:45:33,702 --> 01:45:35,750
She was briefly hospitalized
for emotional issues.

2097
01:45:35,830 --> 01:45:36,831
Well, yes, that's true.

2098
01:45:36,914 --> 01:45:37,915
Yeah.

2099
01:45:38,332 --> 01:45:41,051
We told you we were in a
timeshare on Sanibel Island.

2100
01:45:41,335 --> 01:45:43,929
Wait, you guys have gone
there, like, four times.

2101
01:45:44,004 --> 01:45:47,850
Well, at least one of the
times, we weren't really there.

2102
01:45:48,592 --> 01:45:51,641
I had vaginal reconstruction
surgery last year.

2103
01:45:52,513 --> 01:45:54,265
PETE: That stuff
really works.

2104
01:45:54,348 --> 01:45:57,352
And that's why we don't share
everything with our children.

2105
01:45:59,687 --> 01:46:02,736
I think I understand why
I have communication issues.

2106
01:46:03,190 --> 01:46:04,533
Thank you.
Ma.

2107
01:46:04,692 --> 01:46:06,569
Maybe you should slow down
on the Bloody Marys.

2108
01:46:06,735 --> 01:46:07,861
I don't think
you need any more.

2109
01:46:08,696 --> 01:46:09,913
Oh.
Let her have it.

2110
01:46:10,281 --> 01:46:11,954
CAROL: You're going to
tell me what to do? No.

2111
01:46:12,032 --> 01:46:12,999
Let her have a drink.

2112
01:46:13,075 --> 01:46:15,954
I am going to ask you again.
What are you doing with Violet?

2113
01:46:16,036 --> 01:46:18,038
You're being dumb.

2114
01:46:18,122 --> 01:46:21,342
You are being so
fucking dumb, you idiot.

2115
01:46:21,417 --> 01:46:23,340
You love Violet.
I love Violet,

2116
01:46:23,419 --> 01:46:26,013
your father loves Violet
and you're letting her go?

2117
01:46:26,088 --> 01:46:27,385
Fuck you, you dummy.

2118
01:46:29,717 --> 01:46:30,809
Wow.

2119
01:46:31,385 --> 01:46:33,854
(LAUGHING) Since when do
you talk like this?

2120
01:46:33,929 --> 01:46:35,397
It's not funny, Tom.

2121
01:46:36,223 --> 01:46:37,600
Okay, fine.

2122
01:46:38,142 --> 01:46:39,359
What are you doing?

2123
01:46:39,435 --> 01:46:41,108
Look, we're not 100%
right for each other.

2124
01:46:41,186 --> 01:46:43,188
And so, there's
nothing to be said.

2125
01:46:43,272 --> 01:46:45,445
CAROL: I got news
for you, moron,

2126
01:46:45,608 --> 01:46:49,988
your father and I, we're not
even 90% right for each other.

2127
01:46:50,070 --> 01:46:53,244
Not even 60, okay?
But he's the love of my life.

2128
01:46:53,324 --> 01:46:55,577
And right now, the love of
your life is going to fly away

2129
01:46:55,659 --> 01:46:58,003
and I bet somewhere in the back
of your mind, you're thinking

2130
01:46:58,078 --> 01:47:00,206
that she'll always be there
if you want to try again,

2131
01:47:00,289 --> 01:47:02,712
but you know what? She won't,
because she's the goddamned best!

2132
01:47:02,791 --> 01:47:06,091
And some lucky guy is going to make
it work with her no matter what.

2133
01:47:06,170 --> 01:47:09,845
Instead of settling for some
23-year-old airhead

2134
01:47:09,924 --> 01:47:13,144
who probably doesn't know
who the fucking Beatles are.

2135
01:47:19,642 --> 01:47:21,235
Had to be said.

2136
01:47:22,686 --> 01:47:24,688
Hi, I missed you today.

2137
01:47:25,189 --> 01:47:26,691
That's nice.

2138
01:47:32,029 --> 01:47:33,030
(LAUGHS NERVOUSLY)

2139
01:47:33,113 --> 01:47:34,956
Listen, I need to

2140
01:47:35,741 --> 01:47:36,742
(SMACKS ups)

2141
01:47:36,825 --> 01:47:39,578
talk to you about
something, Audrey.

2142
01:47:42,456 --> 01:47:44,754
What's behind
those eyes, Tom?

2143
01:47:46,627 --> 01:47:51,133
My ex-fiancée has
been on my mind a lot

2144
01:47:51,799 --> 01:47:54,018
and I feel like that's
something I need to explore.

2145
01:47:55,344 --> 01:47:57,267
Well, she's an old bitch!
There.

2146
01:47:57,346 --> 01:47:59,815
I just explored it for you.
Done?

2147
01:48:02,476 --> 01:48:04,570
(SOFTLY) It's hard to have
this conversation with you.

2148
01:48:04,645 --> 01:48:06,238
You need to explore it, Tom?

2149
01:48:06,313 --> 01:48:09,237
You were with her for five fucking years.
That's a really long time.

2150
01:48:09,316 --> 01:48:10,659
What else is there
to learn about her?

2151
01:48:10,818 --> 01:48:12,411
(GROWLS) Oh, God!

2152
01:48:12,486 --> 01:48:13,908
I don't really know
the answer to that,

2153
01:48:13,988 --> 01:48:15,410
but I just think
I need to find out.

2154
01:48:15,489 --> 01:48:17,583
What are you thinking?
You're so stupid.

2155
01:48:17,658 --> 01:48:19,752
You're so stupid.
You're going to leave me?

2156
01:48:19,827 --> 01:48:21,170
You're going to leave this?

2157
01:48:21,245 --> 01:48:24,670
For saggy tits and
a loose vagina? Really?

2158
01:48:25,416 --> 01:48:26,838
Oh, God!

2159
01:48:28,335 --> 01:48:29,928
I'm sorry to do this to you.

2160
01:48:30,004 --> 01:48:31,426
Shut the fuck up.

2161
01:48:31,505 --> 01:48:33,883
You know what?
You should just go, Tom.

2162
01:48:33,966 --> 01:48:37,266
Just go. Go have fun.
Have fun with your old woman.

2163
01:48:37,344 --> 01:48:39,062
Go fucking read
at night together.

2164
01:48:39,138 --> 01:48:40,685
You can go through
menopause together.

2165
01:48:40,764 --> 01:48:42,766
And you can go get
your little prostates checked.

2166
01:48:42,850 --> 01:48:44,944
Check each other
for lumps all the time

2167
01:48:45,019 --> 01:48:47,021
and do those kinds
of things together.

2168
01:48:47,104 --> 01:48:50,278
And then go get some Crocs,
so your back doesn't hurt.

2169
01:48:50,357 --> 01:48:52,280
And then you can
go walk on the beach

2170
01:48:52,359 --> 01:48:55,454
and fuck each other with
your gross, wrinkly balls.

2171
01:48:55,696 --> 01:48:58,449
That's another thing.
You're getting fucking fat.

2172
01:48:58,866 --> 01:49:00,960
It's really hard to
have sex with someone

2173
01:49:01,035 --> 01:49:03,129
when you can't breathe
underneath them.

2174
01:49:03,203 --> 01:49:06,628
Can't breathe! Like, I feel like
I'm going to die every time.

2175
01:49:06,707 --> 01:49:07,959
(SIGHS)

2176
01:49:08,042 --> 01:49:11,342
You should leave.
I'm going to say mean things.

2177
01:49:14,590 --> 01:49:15,716
(SOFTLY) Bye

2178
01:49:16,633 --> 01:49:17,634
(BABY WAILING)

2179
01:49:17,718 --> 01:49:19,891
PRIEST: He makes me lie
down in green pastures

2180
01:49:19,970 --> 01:49:22,439
and leads me
beside still waters.

2181
01:49:23,098 --> 01:49:27,649
He shall refresh my soul and guide
me in the path of righteousness...

2182
01:49:27,728 --> 01:49:29,605
You're my good one.
(WAILING LOUDLY)

2183
01:49:30,564 --> 01:49:32,362
I am so mad, Alex,
when you say that.

2184
01:49:32,441 --> 01:49:34,284
ALEX: At least I'm not
the one failing <i>as</i> a parent.

2185
01:49:34,359 --> 01:49:35,861
It's all right.
It's all right.

2186
01:49:35,944 --> 01:49:37,821
ALEX: Give him
a couple Vicodin.

2187
01:49:42,159 --> 01:49:43,877
Wow. Hi.
Hi.

2188
01:49:44,203 --> 01:49:45,921
Hello.
Hello, Gideon.

2189
01:49:45,996 --> 01:49:47,748
Didn't expect
to see you.

2190
01:49:47,998 --> 01:49:50,251
Just came to say
goodbye properly.

2191
01:49:50,667 --> 01:49:52,590
To my grandmother or...

2192
01:49:52,961 --> 01:49:56,511
Yeah. We actually grew pretty
close towards the end.

2193
01:49:57,257 --> 01:49:58,258
Oh, yeah?

2194
01:49:58,509 --> 01:50:01,513
So, how are you and Tom?
Any kids yet?

2195
01:50:01,845 --> 01:50:02,846
Mmm...

2196
01:50:02,930 --> 01:50:06,275
No. Tom and I split up
a little while ago, so...

2197
01:50:06,350 --> 01:50:07,567
Oh! I'm sorry.

2198
01:50:07,768 --> 01:50:09,270
It has been four
years, of course.

2199
01:50:10,354 --> 01:50:11,355
Hmm?

2200
01:50:12,189 --> 01:50:14,283
Nothing. I...
No, go on. What?

2201
01:50:14,817 --> 01:50:16,945
"Four years, of course" what?
Doesn't make sense.

2202
01:50:17,694 --> 01:50:19,537
That's what you do.

2203
01:50:19,738 --> 01:50:23,709
Is it? Is it what I do? Well,
let me just tell you something.

2204
01:50:23,909 --> 01:50:26,207
Tom and I split up
because it wasn't working.

2205
01:50:26,286 --> 01:50:28,163
Not because we weren't perfect
enough for each other.

2206
01:50:28,247 --> 01:50:30,545
Not because I had him
on a four-year timeline.

2207
01:50:30,707 --> 01:50:31,799
Okay'? So don't...

2208
01:50:31,875 --> 01:50:33,127
Um...

2209
01:50:33,210 --> 01:50:34,427
This is my daughter.

2210
01:50:35,295 --> 01:50:36,296
Sorry.

2211
01:50:36,380 --> 01:50:37,427
She's four.

2212
01:50:37,714 --> 01:50:39,387
This is what
four looks like.

2213
01:50:40,509 --> 01:50:42,807
Hello.
What's your name?

2214
01:50:42,886 --> 01:50:44,229
Violet.

2215
01:50:46,098 --> 01:50:47,771
Regret calling her
that now.

2216
01:50:48,058 --> 01:50:50,902
Keep meaning to changed it,
but it's a lot of paperwork.

2217
01:50:51,687 --> 01:50:52,984
And I don't want
to confuse her.

2218
01:50:54,314 --> 01:50:56,908
Come on, darling. Let's go
and look at the coffin.

2219
01:51:14,251 --> 01:51:15,468
Tom.

2220
01:51:16,420 --> 01:51:19,048
Hi.

2221
01:51:21,133 --> 01:51:23,056
I'm just realizing now, it
might be totally inappropriate

2222
01:51:23,135 --> 01:51:24,682
for me to just
show up like this

2223
01:51:24,761 --> 01:51:26,604
but Alex and Suzie
told me what happened.

2224
01:51:26,763 --> 01:51:29,107
I'm so sorry about
Grandma Katherine.

2225
01:51:29,600 --> 01:51:32,945
She was sort of the only person in
your family who was ever nice to me.

2226
01:51:34,062 --> 01:51:36,861
And I just felt
like I should come.

2227
01:51:38,108 --> 01:51:40,406
But if that's inappropriate,
or weird at all,

2228
01:51:40,485 --> 01:51:42,032
I can totally go
back to the hotel

2229
01:51:42,112 --> 01:51:44,160
or take a tour of the Tower
of London, or something.

2230
01:51:44,239 --> 01:51:47,163
No, no, it's not.
It's...

2231
01:51:48,744 --> 01:51:50,917
It's really nice
to see you.

2232
01:51:52,289 --> 01:51:54,007
It's nice to
see you, too.

2233
01:52:03,967 --> 01:52:05,435
(LAUGHS)

2234
01:52:27,950 --> 01:52:30,044
So, what do we do now?
(BOTH LAUGHING)

2235
01:52:34,164 --> 01:52:37,293
Fall semester doesn't
start until August 14th.

2236
01:52:37,709 --> 01:52:40,337
I know that this
sounds crazy,

2237
01:52:41,838 --> 01:52:44,717
but why don't you just come
back to San Francisco with me?

2238
01:52:44,800 --> 01:52:48,555
You could see your sister and we could
spend a couple of weeks together.

2239
01:52:49,805 --> 01:52:51,899
We don't have to worry
about what it means.

2240
01:52:52,224 --> 01:52:54,477
Then we'll go
our separate ways.

2241
01:52:54,643 --> 01:52:55,769
Okay.

2242
01:52:56,561 --> 01:53:01,067
Just, separately, like, I think it's
time to take down the Wham! posters.

2243
01:53:01,149 --> 01:53:02,651
(BOTH LAUGH)

2244
01:53:08,949 --> 01:53:10,371
(INDISTINCT)

2245
01:53:17,624 --> 01:53:18,716
Yeah?

2246
01:53:19,042 --> 01:53:20,089
Whoo!

2247
01:53:23,005 --> 01:53:24,348
Thank you.

2248
01:53:27,342 --> 01:53:28,685
(LAUGHING)

2249
01:53:57,372 --> 01:54:00,091
I'm getting all
pieces that are here.

2250
01:54:00,167 --> 01:54:01,669
VIOLET: Here, use these ones.

2251
01:54:02,127 --> 01:54:03,800
(TOY CLATTERS)
VIOLET: Oops! Ooh...

2252
01:54:03,879 --> 01:54:05,426
We lost a tower.
SUZIE: Oh, no, the tower.

2253
01:54:05,505 --> 01:54:06,631
VIOLET: That's it.

2254
01:54:06,923 --> 01:54:10,143
So, you know I'm keeping Tom
company this week, right?

2255
01:54:10,510 --> 01:54:11,636
Yeah.

2256
01:54:11,720 --> 01:54:13,097
(LAUGHS)

2257
01:54:13,263 --> 01:54:16,642
Alex keeps him company without
also having sex with him.

2258
01:54:17,267 --> 01:54:18,439
I assume.

2259
01:54:18,685 --> 01:54:20,153
What does that mean?

2260
01:54:20,228 --> 01:54:22,401
Mommy, do Elmo voice.

2261
01:54:23,940 --> 01:54:27,820
(MIMICKING ELMO) Elmo thinks you
should do what you feel is right.

2262
01:54:28,028 --> 01:54:29,280
(LAUGHING)

2263
01:54:29,363 --> 01:54:32,617
Well, I don't really know what I think is right.
I think I'm just...

2264
01:54:32,741 --> 01:54:34,789
You know, time will
tell, I think.

2265
01:54:35,619 --> 01:54:38,839
(MIMICKING ELMO) Elmo
thinks time will tell.

2266
01:54:38,914 --> 01:54:40,712
Would you mind not
doing that Elmo voice?

2267
01:54:40,791 --> 01:54:42,759
'Cause really, you're repeating
back what I'm saying.

2268
01:54:42,834 --> 01:54:46,134
Honestly, (MIMICKING ELMO) Elmo thinks
you should shit or get off the pot.

2269
01:54:46,213 --> 01:54:47,214
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

2270
01:54:47,297 --> 01:54:49,220
Aunt Violet,
do Cookie Monster.

2271
01:54:52,302 --> 01:54:55,647
(MIMICKING COOKIE MONSTER) Me think
that's a really rude thing to say, Elmo.

2272
01:54:55,722 --> 01:54:56,814
(LAUGHING)

2273
01:54:58,183 --> 01:55:02,905
Elmo say it been five years,
almost five years.

2274
01:55:02,979 --> 01:55:04,606
You either love him,
or you don't.

2275
01:55:04,689 --> 01:55:07,442
Me love him, but it's
very complicated.

2276
01:55:07,609 --> 01:55:09,737
Cookie doesn't get
everything handed to him

2277
01:55:09,820 --> 01:55:12,243
on a (WHISPERS) fucking
silver platter like Elmo.

2278
01:55:12,948 --> 01:55:15,827
Cookie got the
career he wanted.

2279
01:55:15,909 --> 01:55:18,628
Tom moved to Michigan
so Cookie could work.

2280
01:55:18,703 --> 01:55:21,957
Okay. Elmo wanted
to be a kinesiologist

2281
01:55:22,040 --> 01:55:26,591
and instead, Elmo is cleaning
puke off her shirt every day.

2282
01:55:26,670 --> 01:55:29,674
Well, maybe as nice
as these little Elmos are,

2283
01:55:29,756 --> 01:55:31,929
Elmo should have considered
using protection.

2284
01:55:32,134 --> 01:55:35,229
"C" is for condom. That's
good enough for me.

2285
01:55:35,554 --> 01:55:40,685
Elmo is very happy with
Elmo's little Elmos, okay?

2286
01:55:40,767 --> 01:55:43,270
Elmo would just like
a break once in a while.

2287
01:55:43,395 --> 01:55:44,567
Fine.
Elmo never gets a break.

2288
01:55:44,646 --> 01:55:48,071
This is fine. But this is precisely
why Cookie wants to take the time

2289
01:55:48,150 --> 01:55:51,029
to consider if he's picked
the right cookie for his life.

2290
01:55:51,111 --> 01:55:54,035
Well, maybe Elmo thinks
there is no right cookie.

2291
01:55:54,114 --> 01:55:56,287
You just pick one
and take a bite.

2292
01:56:03,832 --> 01:56:05,175
(IN NORMAL VOICE) Sorry.

2293
01:56:07,794 --> 01:56:10,638
(MIMICKING ELMO)
Elmo is sorry, too.

2294
01:56:12,466 --> 01:56:13,467
(SIGHS)

2295
01:56:13,550 --> 01:56:15,018
Whose was better?

2296
01:56:15,594 --> 01:56:17,062
Mommy's better.

2297
01:56:20,557 --> 01:56:24,812
(MIMICKING ELMO) The worst choice
you can make is no choice at all.

2298
01:56:26,396 --> 01:56:30,117
Okay? Snack time!
Time for a snack.

2299
01:56:30,859 --> 01:56:33,658
Huh? It's time
for a snack.

2300
01:56:35,071 --> 01:56:36,163
(EXCLAIMING PLAYFULLY)

2301
01:56:36,239 --> 01:56:39,038
My favorite! Just kidding.
I love you both.

2302
01:56:40,410 --> 01:56:41,912
Come get a snack.

2303
01:56:49,711 --> 01:56:51,258
What time is your flight?

2304
01:56:51,338 --> 01:56:52,590
Um... 1235.

2305
01:56:57,177 --> 01:56:59,521
This is stupid.
What are we doing?

2306
01:56:59,596 --> 01:57:00,688
What do you mean?

2307
01:57:00,764 --> 01:57:02,437
I drive a taco truck.

2308
01:57:02,599 --> 01:57:05,944
Okay? I can work anywhere,
and it's just ridiculous.

2309
01:57:07,521 --> 01:57:10,115
It's stupid for us
not to give this another shot.

2310
01:57:11,107 --> 01:57:13,451
Because I love you so much.

2311
01:57:14,444 --> 01:57:16,822
And I'm not going
to let you go.

2312
01:57:17,197 --> 01:57:19,450
Do you remember
the day that we first met?

2313
01:57:19,616 --> 01:57:22,039
The New Year's Eve party.

2314
01:57:22,118 --> 01:57:23,461
Yeah, how can I forget?

2315
01:57:27,374 --> 01:57:30,878
Do you remember how a year
later, we made that list

2316
01:57:30,961 --> 01:57:32,838
of what our marriage
would be like?

2317
01:57:33,380 --> 01:57:35,223
We were going to have 50 kids.

2318
01:57:35,298 --> 01:57:37,346
If I recall,
we settled on 25.

2319
01:57:37,425 --> 01:57:39,268
We did settle on 25.

2320
01:57:42,222 --> 01:57:43,565
That was so dumb.

2321
01:57:43,974 --> 01:57:45,146
(LAUGHS)

2322
01:57:45,600 --> 01:57:47,602
Okay, I'm going to need you
to pull off on this exit.

2323
01:57:47,686 --> 01:57:48,778
Why?

2324
01:57:49,062 --> 01:57:51,064
Just pull over on
this exit over here.

2325
01:57:51,147 --> 01:57:52,114
No, we can just...

2326
01:57:52,232 --> 01:57:53,484
Tom, you're going to miss it!
Quick. Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

2327
01:57:55,110 --> 01:57:56,703
What are you doing?
Sorry. I'm sorry.

2328
01:57:56,820 --> 01:57:58,914
It was just imperative that we
stopped at the exit. Well, why?

2329
01:57:58,989 --> 01:58:01,162
Because I'm trying
to propose to you.

2330
01:58:09,082 --> 01:58:11,255
I don't think that
we can figure out

2331
01:58:11,334 --> 01:58:13,757
all of our problems
before we get married.

2332
01:58:13,837 --> 01:58:17,011
And I'm pretty sure
we'll have some after.

2333
01:58:17,090 --> 01:58:19,138
But I promise you that
I will just love you

2334
01:58:19,217 --> 01:58:21,015
every step of the way.

2335
01:58:21,094 --> 01:58:22,687
So, yes or no?

2336
01:58:35,275 --> 01:58:38,324
I was going to re-propose to you
when we got to the airport.

2337
01:58:38,653 --> 01:58:41,406
(LAUGHING) You were? Tom.

2338
01:58:43,867 --> 01:58:45,210
Oh, Tom.

2339
01:58:48,371 --> 01:58:49,372
(WHISPERS) I love it.

What do you say?

2343
01:58:56,713 --> 01:58:58,886
What do you say?
I asked you first.

2344
01:59:00,050 --> 01:59:02,974
You've made me, like, the
happiest girl in the world.

2345
01:59:10,226 --> 01:59:13,901
Okay, I'm going to need you to
go off to Alamo Square now.

2346
01:59:14,397 --> 01:59:15,398
What are you talk...

2347
01:59:15,482 --> 01:59:17,280
I'm going to need you to go
to Alamo Square please, babe.

Babe, please, just do it.

2350
01:59:19,903 --> 01:59:21,826
Don't think about it.
Just drive.

01:59:22,989 --> 01:59:24,411

a thing planned?

(BOTH LAUGHING)

01:59:36,920 --> 01:59:39,844
Hey, what are you doing? Did you
come to pick up the receipts?

2354
01:59:39,923 --> 01:59:40,924
Did you buy it?

2355
01:59:41,007 --> 01:59:42,008
Yes, he bought it.

2356
01:59:42,342 --> 01:59:43,844
I can't believe this.

2357
01:59:43,927 --> 01:59:45,144
I told you he would.

2358
01:59:45,220 --> 01:59:46,267
What is going on?

2359
01:59:46,346 --> 01:59:48,144
Here. Come on!

Okay, we have some
fast decisions to make.

2363
01:59:53,853 --> 01:59:57,198
Do you want a string quartet,
or a New Orleans brass band?

2364
01:59:57,273 --> 01:59:59,275
What about synthesizer dude?

VIOLET: Oh, I have no idea who that is.
He must have just shown up.

2366

Oh. New Orleans brass band.

2367
02:00:03,780 --> 02:00:05,248
New Orleans brass band.
All right!

extreme Christian,

No, no. Not me.
Just wait until the wedding.
