00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:38,604
Cake, sweaty uncles dancing to Queen.

173
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:41,399
People we thought were dead
flying in from Canada.

174
00:10:41,474 --> 00:10:43,397
It was very wedding-y, right?

175
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:44,819
It was so romantic.

176
00:10:44,894 --> 00:10:46,294
It was just like a Hugh Grant film.

177
00:10:46,437 --> 00:10:48,439
- It was amazing, wasn't it?
- Mmm!

178
00:10:48,523 --> 00:10:50,321
Did you like all the flowers?
We got the most...

179
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,652
I'm sorry.

180
00:10:51,943 --> 00:10:53,570
But can we do this at lunch?

181
00:10:53,987 --> 00:10:55,614
- Right. Absolutely, Helen.
- Thanks.

182
00:10:55,697 --> 00:10:57,665
Ruthlessly efficient, as always.

183
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:58,787
We should not be talking about

184
00:10:58,867 --> 00:11:00,744
- lace halter necks on company time.
- No.

185
00:11:01,744 --> 00:11:04,839
- What's the story?
- While you were on your holiday,

186
00:11:04,998 --> 00:11:06,215
I took the initiative

187
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:08,551
and I started gathering ideas
for Guy Harrap.

188
00:11:08,918 --> 00:11:12,343
He's taken over his father's
industrial solvent and bleach empire.

189
00:11:12,422 --> 00:11:17,223
You weren't here, but he basically wants
to make solvents and bleach sexy.

190
00:11:17,302 --> 00:11:19,270
- Fuck off.
(PHONE RINGING)

191
00:11:21,431 --> 00:11:23,934
JOSH OVER SPEAKER: <i>Is that
my dirty little slut of a wife?</i>

192
00:11:24,809 --> 00:11:25,810
Hey!

193
00:11:25,894 --> 00:11:27,146
<i>What are you doing?</i>

194
00:11:27,228 --> 00:11:29,105
Uh, middle of a meeting. What's up?

195
00:11:29,314 --> 00:11:32,284
Maybe I'm just missing
the sexiest wife in the universe.

196
00:11:32,358 --> 00:11:35,578
- Not working today?
- I've got writer's block.

197
00:11:35,987 --> 00:11:39,958
I can't work out whether to call
my main character Ezra

198
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,794
- or David.
- Um, David.

199
00:11:42,869 --> 00:11:44,542
I was at school with an Ezra
who got expelled

200
00:11:44,621 --> 00:11:45,982
for punching a swan in the throat.

201
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:47,882
<i>Who said the second novel
would be tricky?</i>

202
00:11:48,917 --> 00:11:49,964
<i>Anything else?</i>

203
00:11:50,043 --> 00:11:52,796
No, no, no. I'll see you at three.

204
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:54,381
- Love...
(DIALLING TONE)

205
00:11:54,964 --> 00:11:56,056
...you.

206
00:11:56,132 --> 00:11:58,806
Sorry, that was my husband.

207
00:11:58,885 --> 00:12:00,353
He has writer's block.

208
00:12:00,428 --> 00:12:02,305
Did I mention that
he was a writer, of books?

209
00:12:02,388 --> 00:12:04,436
- Only about a million times.
- Yeah, Clare mentioned it,

210
00:12:04,515 --> 00:12:06,688
but I've never heard of him. (COUGHS)

211
00:12:11,105 --> 00:12:12,152
Sorry, sorry.

212
00:12:12,232 --> 00:12:14,485
You do realise you're not going
any faster than walking, don't you?

213
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:16,661
You've got all the superficial
trappings of a run

214
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:18,909
but there's people walking
much faster than you.

215
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:21,249
You're just expending
a lot of surplus energy.

216
00:12:21,407 --> 00:12:23,409
Thank you for that analysis.

217
00:12:23,493 --> 00:12:24,790
How late are we?

218
00:12:24,869 --> 00:12:27,964
Well, you, my little friend,
are 10 minutes early.

219
00:12:28,039 --> 00:12:30,758
I told you the wrong time because I knew
you'd never be on schedule.

220
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:33,511
- Right.
- Mmm!

221
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:36,465
I'm just trying to work out
if I find that endearing

222
00:12:36,547 --> 00:12:40,097
or it makes me want to bludgeon you
to death with a shovel.

223
00:12:40,176 --> 00:12:41,849
- No, it's endearing.
- I think it's a shovel.

224
00:12:41,928 --> 00:12:44,101
- It's endearing.
- Do we have a shovel?

225
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:47,434
Well, firstly, a hearty "mazoltov"
for your marriage.

226
00:12:48,268 --> 00:12:49,440
- I think it's "mazel tov", isn't it?
- Thank you.

227
00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:51,567
- Mmm?
- I always thought it was "mazel tov".

228
00:12:51,729 --> 00:12:53,106
I don't know, I'm not Jewish.

229
00:12:53,523 --> 00:12:54,570
Oh.

230
00:12:55,233 --> 00:12:59,784
But, as you know, whilst everything
may seem so happy now,

231
00:12:59,862 --> 00:13:02,206
of course you could be
struck down at any time.

232
00:13:02,282 --> 00:13:06,253
Cancer. Heart disease. Meningitis.

233
00:13:06,369 --> 00:13:07,996
Hit by a truck.

234
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:09,501
- Bam!
(GASPS)

235
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:14,261
I had a client who was kicked to death
by a group of disaffected youths

236
00:13:14,335 --> 00:13:15,712
high on meow meow.

237
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:17,968
She'd just left the house
to get potatoes.

238
00:13:19,132 --> 00:13:20,634
- Just potatoes.
- Shit.

239
00:13:20,717 --> 00:13:21,969
And the tragedy was,

240
00:13:22,051 --> 00:13:23,849
she hadn't thought to make a will.

241
00:13:24,429 --> 00:13:26,602
- Or a Tesco home delivery.
(CHUCKLES)

242
00:13:26,681 --> 00:13:27,807
What?

243
00:13:28,683 --> 00:13:29,809
Yeah.

244
00:13:30,476 --> 00:13:33,150
She was only identifiable
by her dental records.

245
00:13:34,188 --> 00:13:35,656
Why, what had they done to her?

246
00:13:35,732 --> 00:13:37,484
They'd made impressions of her teeth.

247
00:13:39,527 --> 00:13:41,450
Still, fortunately, you two have had
the presence of mind

248
00:13:41,529 --> 00:13:42,576
to plan for your future.

249
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:45,033
So, have you considered
what would happen

250
00:13:45,116 --> 00:13:47,539
if either of you
fell into a persistent...

251
00:13:47,618 --> 00:13:50,292
(STUMBLES) - ...vegetatative state?
- A what, sorry?

252
00:13:50,371 --> 00:13:52,294
Persistent vegetatative state.

253
00:13:52,373 --> 00:13:55,047
Mmm.
One too many T's there. "Vegetative."

254
00:13:57,837 --> 00:14:00,636
Have you considered what would happen
if you fell into...

255
00:14:00,715 --> 00:14:01,807
one of these guys?

256
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:04,552
Just pillow talk, really.

257
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:07,939
No, I think we did decide
that we'd both like to be left to die.

258
00:14:08,181 --> 00:14:10,604
Excellent, yes.
We just switched off my aunt.

259
00:14:10,641 --> 00:14:12,234
- I'm sorry.
- Aw.

260
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:14,312
No, it's all right.
It's no quality of life.

261
00:14:14,395 --> 00:14:15,996
And we freed up a socket
for a lava lamp.

262
00:14:16,272 --> 00:14:17,273
Ah.

263
00:14:17,357 --> 00:14:18,478
It's transformed the lounge.

264
00:14:18,524 --> 00:14:19,571
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

265
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:20,947
Largely losing her, to be fair.

266
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:25,290
Now, can we go through a few of these?
Just give me a yes or no.

267
00:14:25,365 --> 00:14:28,369
Are we switching the life support off?

268
00:14:28,451 --> 00:14:29,498
Brain dead?

269
00:14:30,578 --> 00:14:33,252
BOTH: - Switch it off.
- Switch it off. Get it off.

270
00:14:33,956 --> 00:14:35,378
Locked-in syndrome?

271
00:14:36,209 --> 00:14:38,609
That's the one where you're paralysed
but you can still wink.

272
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:39,928
It's all the...

273
00:14:40,546 --> 00:14:42,799
It's the dribble, isn't it,
that I couldn't handle.

274
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:45,322
- Constantly mopping up phlegm.
JOSH: - I wouldn't want that.

275
00:14:45,343 --> 00:14:47,220
You wouldn't want that.
That's why you're murdering your wife.

276
00:14:47,303 --> 00:14:48,304
(GRUNTS)

277
00:14:48,388 --> 00:14:49,548
So, are you switching it off?

278
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:50,772
- Sorry, what are you doing?
NAT: - Off!

279
00:14:50,848 --> 00:14:52,145
- Switch it off, yeah.
- Off she goes!

280
00:14:52,225 --> 00:14:53,943
Night-night.

281
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:58,281
Um, brain-damaged and vegetative.

282
00:14:58,356 --> 00:14:59,858
- Thank you.
- Mmm.

283
00:15:00,233 --> 00:15:01,780
Um, brain stem undamaged.

284
00:15:01,859 --> 00:15:04,738
So you're breathing,
you're swallowing, you're fine,

285
00:15:04,821 --> 00:15:07,825
but you are still literally
a shell of a person

286
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:11,582
with no capacity
for any emotion or thought.

287
00:15:12,537 --> 00:15:14,380
Much like my Susan.

288
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:16,256
My little joke.

289
00:15:17,667 --> 00:15:18,714
(CHUCKLES)

290
00:15:18,793 --> 00:15:20,636
- Off, off.
- Off, yeah, off.

291
00:15:20,711 --> 00:15:24,591
Get that off, off, off, off!

292
00:15:26,134 --> 00:15:27,431
Well, this is slightly more depressing

293
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:28,682
- than I'd imagined.
- Oh, no. Come one.

294
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:30,980
And you haven't even
received my bill yet. (CHUCKLES)

295
00:15:31,055 --> 00:15:32,523
(LAUGHS)

296
00:15:32,723 --> 00:15:34,243
That's a good 'un. That is a good 'un.

297
00:15:41,149 --> 00:15:43,652
- An electric peppermill?
(WHIRRING)

298
00:15:43,734 --> 00:15:45,577
I can't believe you got
an electric peppermill.

299
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,493
We thought we had to have
at least one dinner party

300
00:15:48,573 --> 00:15:50,246
to use all the crap we got bought.

301
00:15:51,033 --> 00:15:52,376
At least that's a useful gift.

302
00:15:52,577 --> 00:15:54,375
D'you know what I mean?
I hate those gifts where someone says,

303
00:15:54,454 --> 00:15:55,501
"Do you know what I've done for you?"

304
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:56,957
"I've donated to charity
on your behalf."

305
00:15:57,039 --> 00:15:58,882
"Have you? Really?" Bollocks to that.

306
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:01,461
If I'm getting married, why should some
African fella get a couple of goats?

307
00:16:01,544 --> 00:16:03,745
I want a fucking smoothie maker,
d'you know what I mean?

308
00:16:05,882 --> 00:16:08,226
- Did you get them goats?
- Four of them.

309
00:16:08,301 --> 00:16:09,348
- Four goats?
- Yeah.

310
00:16:09,427 --> 00:16:11,467
That's a lovely gift, that,
because they need goats.

311
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:14,477
African fella's pleased.

312
00:16:15,433 --> 00:16:18,107
Go on, tell us about your honeymoon.

313
00:16:18,269 --> 00:16:20,818
It was lovely. It was idyllic.

314
00:16:20,897 --> 00:16:22,194
Morocco's beautiful.

315
00:16:22,273 --> 00:16:23,673
- Amazing place, yeah.
NAT: - Yeah.

316
00:16:23,691 --> 00:16:24,988
It was just a bit long, really.

317
00:16:25,067 --> 00:16:26,068
I was really sad when we came back.

318
00:16:26,152 --> 00:16:28,655
NAT: Well, things hit a low point
when we found ourselves

319
00:16:28,738 --> 00:16:30,911
in the Essaouira Museum
of Leather Manufacturing

320
00:16:31,532 --> 00:16:34,081
discussing if we had a superpower,
what would it be?

321
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:37,164
I actually really enjoyed that.
I thought that was really fun.

322
00:16:37,246 --> 00:16:38,748
DANNY: I think if I was
gonna have any superpower,

323
00:16:38,956 --> 00:16:40,583
it would be the ability
to speak Spanish.

324
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:42,961
That would be amazing, wouldn't it?
Because you could say stuff like,

325
00:16:43,044 --> 00:16:45,593
- <i>Hola</i>, gazpacho.
NAT: - You just said it.

326
00:16:45,671 --> 00:16:47,232
JOSH: - You're saying it now.
- Oh, wow.

327
00:16:47,256 --> 00:16:48,678
Hmm.

328
00:16:48,758 --> 00:16:51,102
Not strictly speaking a superpower,
though, is it, really?

329
00:16:51,177 --> 00:16:53,137
Otherwise everyone in Brazil
would be superheroes.

330
00:16:53,471 --> 00:16:54,563
Mmm, true.

331
00:16:54,931 --> 00:16:56,399
They speak Portuguese in Brazil.

332
00:16:57,475 --> 00:16:58,476
You cock.

333
00:16:59,352 --> 00:17:00,729
(LAUGHS)

334
00:17:00,811 --> 00:17:02,734
- Mmm?
- Keep it for the car.

335
00:17:02,813 --> 00:17:05,066
Um, so... Wait, so, Josh,

336
00:17:05,149 --> 00:17:07,072
- what did you choose?
- Boring, really. Super-strength.

337
00:17:07,151 --> 00:17:08,824
That's what I would choose, too!

338
00:17:09,070 --> 00:17:12,040
I think it would be so handy
to be able to open, like, jam jars.

339
00:17:12,114 --> 00:17:14,242
Jam jars! That's exactly...
Isn't that exactly what I said?

340

- That's so funny.
- That is so funny.

Are we eight years old, all of a sudden?
This is what children talk about.

343
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:22,258
All right, Nat, calm down,
we were only having a joke.

00:17:22,333 --> 00:17:23,505
Yeah, joke's over.

Shut up, you "bell-end dot-co-dot-uk".

347

To be honest, I'm not sure
you could get a divorce

348
00:17:33,302 --> 00:17:34,929
because I'm not even sure
you're officially married.

349
00:17:35,012 --> 00:17:36,573

it's pretty funny, really,

because, um, when I left for Africa,

357
00:17:57,034 --> 00:17:58,707
we sort of never formally ended it.

358

I'll tell you, that time.

as the sort of... as the "lost year".

I couldn't do that.

Did you go for the rice or the naan?

852
00:41:30,071 --> 00:41:31,243
I went for the naan.

00:50:09,757 --> 00:50:12,601
I was thinking
more along the lines of lace.

1023
00:50:12,676 --> 00:50:13,768
Were you?

1024
00:50:13,886 --> 00:50:15,433
- Satin?
- Satin.

1025
00:50:16,180 --> 00:50:17,181
Fishnets?

1026
00:50:17,264 --> 00:50:20,939
Fishnets, the fish of the sea.
Fish of the sea. A trawlerman.

1027
00:50:21,018 --> 00:50:24,613
I once saw a trawlerman.

1028
00:50:25,439 --> 00:50:26,782
You must know the lucky lady.

1029
00:50:27,441 --> 00:50:29,034
Any thoughts?

1030
00:50:29,109 --> 00:50:31,509
You're as useless at all this sexy stuff
as I am, aren't you?

1031
00:50:31,612 --> 00:50:34,786
You're happy with a thermal nightie,
a Stieg Larsson and a nice milky tea.

1032
00:50:35,282 --> 00:50:36,454
(CHUCKLES)

1033
00:50:37,618 --> 00:50:41,623
I'm just gonna go have a browse.
Leave you to it.

1034
00:50:43,457 --> 00:50:45,130
Oh, this is nice.

1035
00:50:45,251 --> 00:50:47,470
They also have a wonderful restaurant.

1036
00:50:47,545 --> 00:50:50,469
I wouldn't think of staying
anywhere else when I'm in London.

1037
00:50:50,923 --> 00:50:57,147
So, what is our strategy
when it comes to online awareness?

1038
00:50:57,555 --> 00:51:01,150
So, the idea is to drive the consumer
to the site through...

1039
00:51:01,934 --> 00:51:02,981
Oysters?

1040
00:51:04,770 --> 00:51:05,817
Oysters?

1041
00:51:06,897 --> 00:51:07,989
Seriously, Guy.

1042
00:51:08,649 --> 00:51:11,277
They must have run out
of Highland shortbread.

1043
00:51:12,444 --> 00:51:15,664
To drive consumers to the site
through a unified multiplatform...

1044
00:51:15,781 --> 00:51:17,158
(WHIRRING)

1045
00:51:18,951 --> 00:51:21,830
A unified multiplatform approach,
accessible with...

1046
00:51:21,912 --> 00:51:25,667
(PLAYING SOFT MUSIC)

1047
00:51:25,791 --> 00:51:28,510
Yes, go on. Platforms, that was good.

1048
00:51:29,003 --> 00:51:33,850
Well, traditional media
should not be ignored, either.

1049
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:36,928
Doves? Really?

1050
00:51:37,678 --> 00:51:39,521
I think you're amazing, Nat.

1051
00:51:39,638 --> 00:51:42,312
I know it's unprofessional
and cliché, but...

1052
00:51:42,349 --> 00:51:43,942
I'm married.

1053
00:51:44,643 --> 00:51:46,190
What?

1054
00:51:46,979 --> 00:51:49,027
I'm married. I have a husband.

1055
00:51:51,942 --> 00:51:54,866
How can you?
Why didn't you say something?

1056
00:51:54,987 --> 00:51:57,160
For all this time,
you didn't think to tell me?

1057
00:51:57,197 --> 00:52:00,952
I didn't say anything because
I thought we'd get the account if...

1058
00:52:02,202 --> 00:52:04,000
if I flirted with you.

1059
00:52:04,038 --> 00:52:07,542
And then I liked flirting with you
too much for any of this to stop.

1060
00:52:07,666 --> 00:52:10,545
Well, this wouldn't be happening
if you were happy with your husband.

1061
00:52:11,337 --> 00:52:12,714
What am I supposed to say?

1062
00:52:13,339 --> 00:52:16,559
I can't leave him, he'd be destroyed.
Look, I'm really sorry,

1063
00:52:16,675 --> 00:52:19,053
but that dove's getting
awfully close to the ceiling fan.

1064
00:52:19,845 --> 00:52:21,563
Who is this guy? Do you have children?

1065
00:52:22,139 --> 00:52:24,688
- How long have you been married?
- Look, that's irrelevant. He's...

1066
00:52:24,725 --> 00:52:26,568
He's dependable and...

1067
00:52:27,019 --> 00:52:28,066
(SCREAMS)

1068
00:52:28,896 --> 00:52:30,239
...and he's kind and safe,

1069
00:52:30,314 --> 00:52:32,817
and I can't throw that all away for you.

1070
00:52:32,900 --> 00:52:35,369
I mean, you're charming and twinkly.

1071
00:52:36,987 --> 00:52:39,831
Look, you're a Ferrari and he's a Volvo,
and right now...

1072
00:52:42,493 --> 00:52:44,294
I just need to be
behind the wheel of a Volvo.

1073
00:52:44,536 --> 00:52:46,254
I need... (WAILING)

1074
00:52:46,580 --> 00:52:47,581
(THUDDING)

1075
00:52:48,874 --> 00:52:50,091
I need reliability

1076
00:52:50,501 --> 00:52:54,722
and to be able to get from A to B
safe and unhurt.

1077
00:52:55,005 --> 00:52:56,097
Oh! God!

1078
00:52:56,423 --> 00:52:57,925
Dove down, dove down!

1079
00:52:58,050 --> 00:53:00,678
It's okay, I think it's just stunned.
Can you...

1080
00:53:00,761 --> 00:53:02,729
- Do you want me to stop now?
- Yes.

1081
00:53:02,763 --> 00:53:04,857
Listen, Nat. I'm not giving up.

1082
00:53:05,099 --> 00:53:07,272
From the minute I met you
I've thought of nothing else.

1083
00:53:07,351 --> 00:53:10,776
Do you think I care if our logo
has a drop shadow or is italicised? No.

1084
00:53:11,105 --> 00:53:13,528
I'm looking for excuses to see you.

1085
00:53:13,607 --> 00:53:14,779
VIOLINIST: Come on.

1086
00:53:14,858 --> 00:53:16,781
GUY: And I'm not twinkly.

1087
00:53:17,403 --> 00:53:19,030
I don't twinkle with anyone else.

1088
00:53:19,113 --> 00:53:20,114
(GASPS)

1089
00:53:20,280 --> 00:53:22,282
You make me twinkly.

1090
00:53:24,785 --> 00:53:26,708
Ugh! God!

1091
00:53:26,787 --> 00:53:29,131
- That's supposed to be lucky.
(SCREAMS)

1092
00:53:29,790 --> 00:53:32,088
Look, as might be evident, I've never
done this kind of thing before,

1093
00:53:32,126 --> 00:53:36,222
but I would regret it forever
if I didn't try everything I could.

1094
00:53:36,714 --> 00:53:40,594
Married or not,
I need to be with you, Nat.

1095
00:53:43,429 --> 00:53:45,227
Mind... Mind, um... Sorry.

1096
00:53:45,806 --> 00:53:48,776
I'm sorry. I can't do this. I'm sorry.

1097
00:53:50,644 --> 00:53:52,066
Sorry.

1098
00:53:58,944 --> 00:54:01,914
Perhaps in hindsight
you shouldn't have gone with the doves.

1099
00:54:02,322 --> 00:54:03,494
Thanks.

1100
00:54:06,285 --> 00:54:08,128
- You like those, sir?
- Uh, yeah.

1101
00:54:08,328 --> 00:54:11,673
Crotchless. Interesting, lovely, yeah.
Do you get much of a call for those?

1102
00:54:11,790 --> 00:54:13,670
CHLOE: - Shit.
- Everything all right in there?

1103
00:54:13,792 --> 00:54:16,261
Yeah, I just...
I think this hook is caught.

1104
00:54:16,336 --> 00:54:18,179
Yeah, I got it.
Uh, yeah, I have to admit

1105
00:54:18,338 --> 00:54:21,262
I'm not very good with
buttons or zips or that sort of thing.

1106
00:54:21,341 --> 00:54:23,594
Usually I... Holy fucking shit.

1107
00:54:25,596 --> 00:54:27,197
I mean, who needs a dehumidifier, right?

1108
00:54:27,514 --> 00:54:31,269
Sure, I get a bit of condensation on my
bedroom window sometimes, but it's fine.

1109
00:54:31,685 --> 00:54:34,313
- Will you just close the...
- Oh, yeah, sorry. Sorry.

1110
00:54:34,855 --> 00:54:37,028
- Um...
- Look, were they always like that?

1111
00:54:37,149 --> 00:54:39,652
'Cause, I mean, they're unbelievable.

1112
00:54:39,693 --> 00:54:44,369
I just thought that
I would try something unpractical.

1113
00:54:46,033 --> 00:54:50,163
Do you think that Nat
would like something like this, or...

1114
00:54:50,204 --> 00:54:51,797
Nat?

1115
00:54:51,872 --> 00:54:55,376
Oh, of course.
Yeah, she'd look really nice.

1116
00:54:57,044 --> 00:54:58,842
She'd look good.

1117
00:54:58,879 --> 00:55:00,222
Um...

1118
00:55:00,547 --> 00:55:02,140
Yeah, but I think maybe the...

1119
00:55:02,216 --> 00:55:03,638
- I don't know if it's...
- What is it?

1120
00:55:03,717 --> 00:55:05,890
I don't know if it's caught on the tag.

1121
00:55:06,887 --> 00:55:08,059
I don't know what I did.

1122
00:55:08,138 --> 00:55:10,186
Your hair's in the way,
I'm just gonna...

1123
00:55:18,732 --> 00:55:21,235
You know those, um,

1124
00:55:21,735 --> 00:55:24,909
strips that they put in pants...

1125
00:55:25,906 --> 00:55:27,908
if you want to try them on?

1126
00:55:29,326 --> 00:55:32,921
Do you think that's to prevent
against gonorrhoea or chlamydia?

1127
00:55:34,581 --> 00:55:37,380
That's the one these days, Chlamydia.
That's...

1128
00:55:37,417 --> 00:55:39,920
(STAMMERING)
Or so I've... so I've read.

1129
00:55:56,603 --> 00:55:58,776
Oh, my God, I'm so sorry.
I don't know why I did that.

1130
00:55:58,856 --> 00:56:02,201
No. I'm so sorry. I'm sorry.

1131
00:56:02,276 --> 00:56:04,870
CLAUDIA: Excuse me, sir,
will you be paying for that?

1132
00:56:06,947 --> 00:56:08,620
Christ, I expect so.

1133
00:56:09,032 --> 00:56:10,124
I'm sorry.

1134
00:56:10,242 --> 00:56:12,620
I'm sorry, I just wanted you to know
how I feel about you

1135
00:56:12,703 --> 00:56:16,003
- and I don't want to let you slip away.
- It's very complicated.

1136
00:56:16,123 --> 00:56:18,296
- Chloe, that was really bad.
- I know.

1137
00:56:18,375 --> 00:56:21,219
I mean, not the kiss or the visuals,
that was lovely,

1138
00:56:21,461 --> 00:56:23,589
- but I'm married.
- I know.

1139
00:56:23,797 --> 00:56:25,970
Oh, great, it's goddamn Beyoncé.

1140
00:56:26,216 --> 00:56:28,719
What?! Fuck!

1141
00:56:28,802 --> 00:56:31,146
- Beyoncé is my husband!
- What?

1142
00:56:31,221 --> 00:56:32,894
Beyoncé is my husband!

1143
00:56:33,473 --> 00:56:34,645
- Beyoncé is Josh.
- Him?

1144
00:56:34,766 --> 00:56:36,143
Yes.

1145
00:56:36,768 --> 00:56:38,065
Nat!

1146
00:56:39,229 --> 00:56:40,981
- Hello, darling!
- How weird!

1147
00:56:41,148 --> 00:56:43,150
- What a treat.
- How are you?

1148
00:56:43,817 --> 00:56:45,569
- Hi, Chloe.
- Hi.

1149
00:56:45,819 --> 00:56:48,288
- Guy, right?
- Yeah. Josh?

1150
00:56:48,322 --> 00:56:49,762
Yeah, that's right. Nice to see you.

1151
00:56:49,781 --> 00:56:53,001
Guy, this is Chloe.
She's a wonderful, uh...

1152
00:56:53,160 --> 00:56:54,332
charity worker.

1153
00:56:54,411 --> 00:56:55,833
- Hi.
- Hi.

1154
00:56:55,996 --> 00:56:57,794
Yeah, we were just doing
some Christmas shopping.

1155
00:56:57,831 --> 00:56:59,174
We were just having a meeting
around the corner.

1156
00:56:59,291 --> 00:57:00,634
- Oh, were you?
- Yeah.

1157
00:57:00,667 --> 00:57:03,011
- Nice.
- Yeah.

1158
00:57:05,005 --> 00:57:07,428
- Did you have fun last night?
- Oh, it was awesome, awesome.

1159
00:57:07,507 --> 00:57:10,681
Did you manage to get lucky
with the ladies?

1160
00:57:11,303 --> 00:57:14,682
No. Actually,
the girl I had my eye on blew me off.

1161
00:57:14,848 --> 00:57:17,101
I ended up alone in the hotel
with a mini sleeve of Pringles

1162
00:57:17,184 --> 00:57:19,152
watching Malaysian golf on Eurosport.

1163
00:57:19,186 --> 00:57:21,609
(LAUGHING LOUDLY)
- That's hilarious.

1164
00:57:26,610 --> 00:57:28,704
I find that incredibly
difficult to believe.

1165
00:57:28,862 --> 00:57:29,988
Well, it's true, it's true.

1166
00:57:30,113 --> 00:57:31,615
What, a man as good-looking as you?

1167
00:57:31,698 --> 00:57:36,499
Fabulous face, amazing hair,
wonderful teeth.

1168
00:57:36,536 --> 00:57:38,538
- A real hunk of spunk.
- Thank you.

1169
00:57:38,622 --> 00:57:42,001
Amazing skin, that's what...
Hasn't he got incredible skin?

1170
00:57:42,876 --> 00:57:44,844
- You do.
- Thank you.

1171
00:57:44,878 --> 00:57:46,551
It's inspirational.

1172
00:57:47,839 --> 00:57:49,682
Chloe's single. Aren't you?

1173
00:57:50,717 --> 00:57:52,310
And she's American.

1174
00:57:52,386 --> 00:57:54,559
And you're... you could...
(AMERICAN ACCENT) ...ride the subway

1175
00:57:54,680 --> 00:57:57,229
and have a malt at the Five and Dime.

1176
00:57:57,349 --> 00:57:58,475
If that takes your fancy.

1177
00:57:59,685 --> 00:58:01,403
If you want to.

1178
00:58:01,520 --> 00:58:03,568
- Are you okay?
- Yeah. Yeah.

1179
00:58:03,689 --> 00:58:05,609
Poor Chloe could probably think
of nothing worse,

1180
00:58:05,732 --> 00:58:07,734
but maybe if we all
went out together sometime,

1181
00:58:07,859 --> 00:58:10,408
- that could be cool.
- Ooh!

1182
00:58:10,737 --> 00:58:13,240
You could set that up,
couldn't you, Nat? Is that all right?

1183
00:58:13,323 --> 00:58:17,578
Yes, yes, absolutely.
I will organise it. I'll organise it.

1184
00:58:17,661 --> 00:58:18,753
Awesome.

1185
00:58:18,829 --> 00:58:20,001
- Great.
- Okay.

1186
00:58:20,080 --> 00:58:21,753
- Dinner after Christmas.

01:05:58,204 --> 01:06:01,925
Chloe's lovely.
I don't know how you let her slip away.

1354
01:06:02,250 --> 01:06:04,002
What, Chloe? No!

1355
01:06:05,003 --> 01:06:07,426
She's too nice. She's too perfect.

1356
01:06:07,505 --> 01:06:09,633
A little of Chloe goes a long way.

1357
01:06:09,716 --> 01:06:11,434
Yeah, I mean,
she can be kind of grating.

1358
01:06:11,509 --> 01:06:14,388
Totally. This one? Rugby?

1359
01:06:15,555 --> 01:06:16,647
No?

1360
01:06:17,223 --> 01:06:20,477
But Guy, I mean, he's quite a catch.
He's just your type, really.

1361
01:06:20,560 --> 01:06:24,064
(SCOFFS) No, he's too slick
for his own good.

1362
01:06:24,606 --> 01:06:25,983
Bit too American.

1363
01:06:26,733 --> 01:06:28,733
You're my type.
I don't really go for good-looking.

1364
01:06:29,319 --> 01:06:30,662
Oh.

1365
01:06:35,200 --> 01:06:38,670
Hi. Great to see you.
You're looking very sexy.

1366
01:06:38,745 --> 01:06:39,997
And, Nat, you look good, too.

1367
01:06:40,079 --> 01:06:42,332
(LAUGHING)

1368
01:06:44,626 --> 01:06:45,906
Uh, you two pop yourselves down.

1369
01:06:45,919 --> 01:06:47,216
I'm gonna nip off
to the little boys' room.

1370
01:06:47,295 --> 01:06:49,798
See if I can find myself
some little boys.

1371
01:06:49,881 --> 01:06:52,134
Obviously not.
Just gonna go for a quick wee.

1372
01:06:52,217 --> 01:06:53,264
Not the other.

1373
01:06:55,595 --> 01:06:57,393
Sorry about that.

1374
01:07:04,270 --> 01:07:06,364
So, is tonight not a bit weird?

1375
01:07:06,439 --> 01:07:08,692
Do you promise
not to get insanely jealous?

1376
01:07:08,775 --> 01:07:10,368
(LAUGHS)

1377
01:07:10,443 --> 01:07:11,786
Honestly.

1378
01:07:12,737 --> 01:07:15,991
Chloe is fantastic. You'll love her.

1379
01:07:16,658 --> 01:07:21,164
She's the best. The best!
She's so kind. Wonderfully kind.

1380
01:07:21,246 --> 01:07:23,590
- Mmm. Mmm.
- And pretty. She's very pretty.

1381
01:07:23,665 --> 01:07:26,635
Definitely, she's so pretty.
Hundred percent.

1382
01:07:31,923 --> 01:07:33,425
Hey, Chloe, you're here.

1383
01:07:33,508 --> 01:07:36,512
Yeah. Look, if this is weird, I can go.

1384
01:07:36,636 --> 01:07:39,856
It's just that, you know, you set it up
and you didn't seem to mind.

1385
01:07:39,931 --> 01:07:41,649
No, I don't mind, it's not weird.
Why would I find it weird?

1386
01:07:41,724 --> 01:07:44,773
Listen, the bloke's a bit of a twat,
but you might like him.

1387
01:07:45,311 --> 01:07:47,439
Oh, yeah! I love a twat.

1388
01:07:47,522 --> 01:07:49,570
Single girl, looking for a guy.

1389
01:07:49,649 --> 01:07:51,947
No non-twats considered.

1390
01:07:52,026 --> 01:07:53,306
Oh, shit. Okay, they've seen us.

1391
01:07:54,612 --> 01:07:56,455
Let's go do this.

1392
01:07:56,531 --> 01:08:00,707
Okay, final game.
It's Brits one, Yanks one.

1393
01:08:00,785 --> 01:08:03,629
We owe this to our great nation
to win this, Chloe.

1394
01:08:03,705 --> 01:08:04,957
- Let's do it.
- Yes, sir!

1395
01:08:05,039 --> 01:08:07,462
Just look at us. We're all getting on
like a house on fire.

1396
01:08:07,542 --> 01:08:09,294
I've never really understood
that phrase.

1397
01:08:09,377 --> 01:08:10,424
(LAUGHS)
- Exactly why is it good

1398
01:08:10,503 --> 01:08:13,382
to get on like a house on fire? I mean,
there might be small kids left inside.

1399
01:08:13,464 --> 01:08:14,556
- Think of them.
CHLOE: - I know!

1400
01:08:14,632 --> 01:08:17,135
And the possibility of asphyxiation...

1401
01:08:17,218 --> 01:08:19,266
JOSH: Or at the very least,
the loss of any no-claims bonus.

1402
01:08:19,345 --> 01:08:20,517
(LAUGHS)

1403
01:08:20,638 --> 01:08:21,981
It's just a metaphor.

1404
01:08:22,056 --> 01:08:24,525
It means something that's
uncontrollable, has momentum.

1405
01:08:24,642 --> 01:08:26,610
Exactly. So, tell me this.

1406
01:08:26,686 --> 01:08:29,246
What would be the first thing
you'd save in a fire? Let me guess.

1407
01:08:29,522 --> 01:08:31,274
- Jimmy Choos.
- Your wedding ring.

1408
01:08:31,357 --> 01:08:32,358
(LAUGHS)

1409
01:08:33,067 --> 01:08:34,944
Well, obviously my wedding ring.

1410
01:08:35,028 --> 01:08:37,451
But I've got two hands, haven't I?

1411
01:08:37,530 --> 01:08:39,032
She does love that ring.

1412
01:08:39,616 --> 01:08:42,210
The first thing I noticed about you.
Wasn't it?

1413
01:08:56,841 --> 01:08:58,764
(SIGHS)

1414
01:09:00,011 --> 01:09:01,058
Sorry, Nat. Excuse me.

1415
01:09:07,644 --> 01:09:08,691
Fuck off.

1416
01:09:09,937 --> 01:09:11,280
Yeah, that's too bad.

1417
01:09:11,731 --> 01:09:13,859
I'd probably rescue that necklace
that I got you

1418
01:09:13,941 --> 01:09:15,739
when we got engaged in Venice.

1419
01:09:15,818 --> 01:09:17,946
That's sweet. It's beautiful.

1420
01:09:19,947 --> 01:09:21,494
How about you, Chloe?

1421
01:09:21,616 --> 01:09:24,290
I'm guessing something
sentimental, emotional?

1422
01:09:25,119 --> 01:09:26,166
Um...

1423
01:09:26,245 --> 01:09:28,043
- It's your shot, Guy.
- Sorry?

1424
01:09:28,122 --> 01:09:30,875
- It's your shot, mate.
- Sorry.

1425
01:09:30,958 --> 01:09:33,211
You wouldn't really head for the shoes,
though, would you, Chloe?

1426
01:09:33,294 --> 01:09:34,967
Fashion's not really your thing.

1427
01:09:35,254 --> 01:09:37,302
GUY: Why would it be?
I mean, look at her.

1428
01:09:37,423 --> 01:09:38,640
She'd make anything look fantastic.

1429
01:09:38,716 --> 01:09:39,808
(SCOFFS)

1430
01:09:40,134 --> 01:09:42,808
- She'd make a sack look incredible.
(CHLOE GIGGLING) - Thanks.

1431
01:09:42,887 --> 01:09:44,013
Good shot.

1432
01:09:44,097 --> 01:09:47,271
Yeah, it's like, what's the opposite of,
"You cannot polish a turd"?

1433
01:09:47,558 --> 01:09:49,276
She's an already polished turd.

1434
01:09:49,560 --> 01:09:52,154
She's a turd buffed to a high sheen.

1435
01:09:53,064 --> 01:09:54,316
Thanks.

1436
01:09:54,857 --> 01:09:55,904
JOSH: Unlucky, pal.

1437
01:09:55,983 --> 01:09:57,405
Yeah, honestly, if the stuff burnt up,

1438
01:09:57,485 --> 01:10:00,329
I think I'd just view it
as a chance to start over,

1439
01:10:00,405 --> 01:10:04,785
you know, have a new adventure. I'm not
too bothered by material possessions.

1440
01:10:04,867 --> 01:10:07,336
All right, come down on it a bit.

1441
01:10:07,745 --> 01:10:09,167
Come on.

1442
01:10:09,247 --> 01:10:11,007
And use your arm
to go back and forth with it

1443
01:10:11,040 --> 01:10:12,641
so you really get a nice pumping action.

1444
01:10:12,917 --> 01:10:14,043
Then go through the ball,

1445
01:10:14,127 --> 01:10:16,095
and you want to hit it
on the edge there.

1446
01:10:16,170 --> 01:10:17,922
Ah, ah, ah! If you put the cue

1447
01:10:18,172 --> 01:10:19,773
between your thumb
and your first finger,

1448
01:10:19,799 --> 01:10:21,927
you'll find it easier to get...
That's it.

1449
01:10:21,968 --> 01:10:24,938
Now get this moving
before you take the shot.

1450
01:10:25,012 --> 01:10:26,133
Come down a bit lower on it.

1451
01:10:26,764 --> 01:10:28,812
Don't take the...
Come on, not that low.

1452
01:10:29,642 --> 01:10:32,942
That's it.
Now play through the ball, and breathe.

1453
01:10:35,022 --> 01:10:36,319
There's no point, is there?

1454
01:10:36,399 --> 01:10:38,993
If we're not gonna do it properly,
it's like, what's the point?

1455
01:10:39,068 --> 01:10:40,445
- There's no point in playing, is there?
- Nice try.

1456
01:10:40,528 --> 01:10:42,326
CHLOE: Oh, I think it's my shot.

1457
01:10:42,405 --> 01:10:43,782
I think Chloe's right.

1458
01:10:43,865 --> 01:10:48,120
I mean, nice things is great,
but ultimately, so what?

1459
01:10:48,202 --> 01:10:50,204
As long as the people you love are safe.

1460
01:10:51,122 --> 01:10:52,374
That's it. You got that?

1461
01:10:53,499 --> 01:10:54,716
(GUY LAUGHS)
JOSH: - Good shot, Chloe.

1462
01:10:54,792 --> 01:10:56,214
(LAUGHS)
- Did you see that?

1463
01:10:56,294 --> 01:10:58,092
That was... Wow!

1464
01:10:58,171 --> 01:11:00,424
CHLOE: I can't believe it. Oh!

1465
01:11:00,590 --> 01:11:03,639
- It'll never happen again.
- Oh, it will. Be positive.

1466
01:11:03,718 --> 01:11:06,312
CHLOE: No. Once in a lifetime.

1467
01:11:07,138 --> 01:11:09,641
It's so sweet,
what you said about that necklace.

1468
01:11:09,724 --> 01:11:10,725
JOSH: Yeah.

1469
01:11:10,808 --> 01:11:13,652
- I should wear it more often.
- Okay. What do you think?

1470
01:11:13,728 --> 01:11:16,902
- I think you're good on your own.
- Oh, you touched the cue ball.

1471
01:11:16,981 --> 01:11:18,358
- Oh.
- So...

1472
01:11:18,441 --> 01:11:20,034
- Really?
- I mean, if you want to play proper...

1473
01:11:20,109 --> 01:11:21,986
No, it's fine if you want to...

1474
01:11:22,069 --> 01:11:23,537
- Okay.
- Sorry.

1475
01:11:23,613 --> 01:11:25,035
- Happens all the time, don't worry.
- I'm sorry.

1476
01:11:25,114 --> 01:11:26,286
It's two shots if...

1477
01:11:26,365 --> 01:11:28,868
- No, no, it's cool. You...
- All right. No, no. No, go ahead.

1478
01:11:28,951 --> 01:11:30,328
- I don't want to be a dick about it...
- No!

1479
01:11:30,411 --> 01:11:31,451
- Too late.
- Are you sure?

1480
01:11:31,496 --> 01:11:32,656
- Take your two shots.
- Fine.

1481
01:11:32,789 --> 01:11:34,791
- Well, that was fun.
- Yeah.

1482
01:11:34,874 --> 01:11:36,501
We should do it again.
What do you say, Josh?

1483
01:11:36,584 --> 01:11:38,131
Give you Brits a chance for revenge?

1484
01:11:38,252 --> 01:11:40,880
Oh, yeah, 'cause...
When my elbow's a bit better,

1485
01:11:40,963 --> 01:11:42,590
I'll be able to give you
a much better game. Probably win.

1486
01:11:42,673 --> 01:11:44,346
Yeah, that sounds fun.

1487
01:11:44,425 --> 01:11:45,517
Can I walk you to your car?

1488
01:11:45,635 --> 01:11:48,229
Oh, you know,
I'm just gonna catch a cab,

1489
01:11:48,304 --> 01:11:50,147
but you can wait with me if you like.

1490
01:11:50,223 --> 01:11:51,941
- Be my pleasure.
- Okay.

1491
01:11:52,016 --> 01:11:54,986
Actually, Guy, do you mind
if I quickly grab you for two minutes?

1492
01:11:55,061 --> 01:11:57,189
Just to talk packaging
before the meeting.

1493
01:11:57,522 --> 01:11:58,648
Is that okay?

1494
01:11:59,482 --> 01:12:01,484
- Sure.
- Thanks. Sorry.

1495
01:12:02,235 --> 01:12:04,329
Well, I could help you
get a cab, if you want.

1496
01:12:04,654 --> 01:12:05,780
And I'll wait with you.

1497
01:12:07,615 --> 01:12:09,333
Okay, yeah.

1498
01:12:10,868 --> 01:12:12,745
- I had a blast, partner.
- Oh!

1499
01:12:12,829 --> 01:12:15,002
We are what make our nation great.

1500
01:12:15,456 --> 01:12:18,084
I'd like to check out that Kandinsky
thing you were talking about.

1501
01:12:18,167 --> 01:12:20,090
That sounds very interesting.

1502
01:12:20,628 --> 01:12:22,175
Thank you.

1503
01:12:24,674 --> 01:12:26,676
Aw, that's nice. All right?

1504
01:12:26,759 --> 01:12:28,386
Okay, I'll see you back at the flat.

1505
01:12:28,469 --> 01:12:30,597
All right. All the best.

1506
01:12:33,057 --> 01:12:34,497
I presume we need to make a decision

1507
01:12:34,559 --> 01:12:37,654

for the branding.

(LAUGHS) No, good luck to you.

1685
01:23:30,756 --> 01:23:33,805
- Thanks.
- But, I mean, you did it. One year!

1686
01:23:33,884 --> 01:23:35,010
- Yay!
- Yay!

1687
01:23:35,093 --> 01:23:36,766
Don't you clap.

1688
01:23:37,679 --> 01:23:39,681
Go on, give that twat
of a husband another call.

1689
01:23:39,765 --> 01:23:40,857
Don't use your phone, use mine.

Happy one year.

1695
01:24:36,405 --> 01:24:37,827
I need to tell you something, Nat.

1696
01:24:40,117 --> 01:24:42,336
I just think you're
the most incredible woman.

1697
01:24:42,619 --> 01:24:44,713
- Aw!
- How about that?

1698
01:24:44,788 --> 01:24:46,711
So beautiful.

1699
01:24:47,082 --> 01:24:50,052
And smart and bright and funny.

1700
01:24:50,794 --> 01:24:51,886
You're perfect.

1701
01:24:52,963 --> 01:24:55,307
- You're the perfect wife.
DIANA: - Aw, sweet.

1702
01:24:58,635 --> 01:24:59,727
But just not for me.

1703
01:25:01,638 --> 01:25:04,016
I've waited my whole life
for the right girl to show up.

1704
01:25:04,433 --> 01:25:06,185
And it turns out that you weren't it.

1705
01:25:06,685 --> 01:25:09,859
I don't find the way that you crinkle
your nose when you laugh adorable,

1706
01:25:09,938 --> 01:25:11,235
the way you flick your hair,

1707
01:25:11,315 --> 01:25:12,817
- it's quite frankly irritating.
DANNY: - Hear, hear.

1708
01:25:12,899 --> 01:25:14,901
I wanted to cherish
everything about you,

1709
01:25:14,985 --> 01:25:17,955
but it just didn't happen.

1710
01:25:20,198 --> 01:25:21,996
So I guess what I'm trying to say is...

1711
01:25:22,993 --> 01:25:24,540
Natasha Moss...

1712
01:25:25,996 --> 01:25:27,339
will you divorce me?

1713
01:25:29,666 --> 01:25:31,088
Yes.

1714
01:25:31,168 --> 01:25:33,762
Yes. Yes! I will!

1715
01:25:33,837 --> 01:25:35,589
- I absolutely will!
- That's so amazing!

1716
01:25:35,672 --> 01:25:37,424
- Do you really mean it?
- Absolutely!

1717
01:25:37,507 --> 01:25:40,602
I've been waiting for this moment
for months, hoping it would happen.

1718
01:25:40,677 --> 01:25:42,038
I can't believe that you asked me.

1719
01:25:42,054 --> 01:25:43,522
Why didn't you just say something, then?

1720
01:25:43,597 --> 01:25:46,521
I didn't want to hurt your feelings.
I thought it would break your heart.

1721
01:25:46,850 --> 01:25:50,229
You've made me the happiest woman
in the world.

1722
01:25:51,355 --> 01:25:52,402
I love you.

1723
01:25:52,731 --> 01:25:53,857
But you're not in love with me.

1724
01:25:53,940 --> 01:25:56,113
No! God, no.

1725
01:25:56,193 --> 01:25:58,070
Unequivocally not in love with you.

1726
01:25:58,445 --> 01:26:00,618
The opposite. The opposite of love.
Misery.

1727
01:26:00,697 --> 01:26:02,620
- Me, too!
(LAUGHS)

1728
01:26:03,367 --> 01:26:05,540
I can't believe
we felt the same for so long.

1729
01:26:05,619 --> 01:26:09,419
Well, listen,
now we have the rest of our lives

1730
01:26:09,790 --> 01:26:11,087
not to be together.

1731
01:26:14,169 --> 01:26:15,512
Cheers?

1732
01:26:15,587 --> 01:26:17,840
Look, this is amazing, it's magical.

1733

It's better than I could
ever have imagined,

that I really need to be right now.

Oh, go! Seriously, go.
Do you need money for a cab?

1736
01:26:23,261 --> 01:26:24,308
No, I'm all right, I'm in the car,

1737
01:26:24,388 --> 01:26:26,311
but it was a nightmare trying to park,
so I'm basically in a...

Oh, God, stop it. Stop it.
It's so boring.

1739
01:26:29,601 --> 01:26:31,319
- It's just, the car's in your name...
- It's so boring.

1740
01:26:31,395 --> 01:26:33,489
- We should sort that out, actually.
- It's so boring. I don't care.

1741
01:26:33,563 --> 01:26:35,657
- All right, but...
- Honestly. Just go.

(SCOFFS) - Love.
- Well, I do.

1850
01:33:12,087 --> 01:33:13,304
Yeah, sounds a bit gay.

1851
01:33:13,755 --> 01:33:15,007
We can get back out there like the lads.

1852
01:33:15,090 --> 01:33:17,513
Like the old days, you know?
The Terrible Two.

1853
01:33:17,592 --> 01:33:18,593
Do you know what I mean?

1854
01:33:18,676 --> 01:33:20,519
"Lock up your daughters.
And your mothers."

1855
01:33:20,595 --> 01:33:21,847
I'm not fussy.

1856
01:33:22,180 --> 01:33:24,228
Every time I open my mouth
when I'm around her, she's like,

1857
01:33:24,307 --> 01:33:26,480
(MOCKINGLY) "No, don't say that.
You can't say that."

1858
01:33:26,559 --> 01:33:27,606
"You can't do that."

1859
01:33:27,936 --> 01:33:30,860
"Put your trousers on! Put your
trousers on! We're in a restaurant!"

1860
01:33:30,939 --> 01:33:33,192
- Oh, shut up.
- Well, she's... (SIGHS)
