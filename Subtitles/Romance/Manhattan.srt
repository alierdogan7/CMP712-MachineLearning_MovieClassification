00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:38,916
<i>"Chapter one. "</i>

2
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:43,079
<i>"He adored New York City. </i>
<i>He idolised it all out of proportion. "</i>

3
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:47,751
<i>Uh, no. Make that "He romanticised it</i>
<i>all out of proportion. "</i>

4
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:50,235
<i>"To him, </i>
<i>no matter what the season was, </i>

5
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:53,477
<i>this was still a town</i>
<i>that existed in black and white</i>

6
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:56,751
<i>and pulsated to the great tunes</i>
<i>of George Gershwin. "</i>

7
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:59,314
<i>Uh... no. Let me start this over. </i>

8
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:01,476
<i>"Chapter one. "</i>

9
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:05,354
<i>"He was too romantic about Manhattan, </i>
<i>as he was about everything else. "</i>

10
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:08,950
<i>"He thrived on the hustle, bustle</i>
<i>of the crowds and the traffic. "</i>

11
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:11,230
<i>"To him, New York</i>
<i>meant beautiful women</i>

12
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:15,035
<i>and street-smart guys</i>
<i>who seemed to know all the angles. "</i>

13
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:18,311
<i>Ah, corny. Too corny</i>
<i>for a man of my taste. </i>

14
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:20,670
<i>Let me... try and make it more profound. </i>

15
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:24,429
<i>"Chapter one. He adored New York City. "</i>

16
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:28,712
<i>"To him, it was a metaphor</i>
<i>for the decay of contemporary culture. "</i>

17
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:32,833
<i>"The same lack of integrity to cause so</i>
<i>many people to take the easy way out... </i>

18
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:35,713
<i>... was rapidly turning the town</i>
<i>of his dreams..."</i>

19
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:39,992
<i>No, it's gonna be too preachy. I mean, </i>
<i>face it, I wanna sell some books here. </i>

20
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:42,839
<i>"Chapter one. He adored New York City, </i>

21
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:47,192
<i>although to him it was a metaphor</i>
<i>for the decay of contemporary culture. "</i>

22
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:52,474
<i>"How hard it was to exist in a society</i>
<i>desensitised by drugs, loud music, </i>

23
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:55,319
<i>television, crime, garbage..."</i>

24
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:57,556
<i>Too angry. I don't wanna be angry. </i>

25
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,910
<i>"Chapter one. "</i>

26
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:02,952
<i>"He was as tough and romantic</i>
<i>as the city he loved. "</i>

27
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:07,631
<i>"Behind his black-rimmed glasses was</i>
<i>the coiled sexual power of a jungle cat. "</i>

28
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:09,273
<i>I love this. </i>

29
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:12,710
<i>"New York was his town</i>
<i>and it always would be. "</i>

30
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:08,911
I think the essence of art is to provide
a kind of working-through situation,

31
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:12,430
so that you can get in touch
with feelings you didn't know you had.

32
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:16,712
Talent is luck.
The important thing in life is courage.

33
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:20,958
- They've had this argument for 20 years.
- Listen to this example.

34
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:25,835
If the four of us are walking home over
the bridge and a person was drowning,

35
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:27,916
would we have the nerve...

36
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:31,715
Would one of us have the nerve
to dive into the icy water and save them?

37
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,592
It's a key question.

38
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:36,393
l, of course, can't swim,
so I never have to face it.

39
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:39,196
Oh... God.

40
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,796
Which of us?

41
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:45,480
- You want a little more?
- No.

42
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:49,275
Mm. Oh, man. That is so great.

43
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:51,152
You don't smoke.

44
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:55,637
I know I don't smoke. I don't inhale
because it gives you cancer, but

45
00:04:56,080 --> 00:05:00,949
I look so incredibly handsome
with a cigarette that I can't <i>not</i> hold one.

46
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:04,476
You like the way I look?

47
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:05,953
Provocative.

48
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:09,834
- I'm getting through to you?
- Yup. You have to excuse me a sec.

49
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,151
Jesus, she's gorgeous.

50
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,996
But she's 17 7.

51
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,316
I'm 42 and she's 17 7.

52
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:24,233
I'm... I'm older than her father.
Can you believe that?

53
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:27,672
I'm dating a girl
wherein I can beat up her father.

54
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:30,678
That's the first time
that ever occurred in my life.

55
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:34,873
- He's drunk.
- You're drunk. You should never drink.

56
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,436
Did I tell you... that my ex-wife...

57
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:42,109
- Who, Tina?
- My second ex-wife

58
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:45,918
is writing a book about
our marriage and the break-up.

59
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:49,157
- That's really tacky.
- It's really depressing, you know.

60
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:53,717
She's gonna give all those details out,
all my little idiosyncrasies,

61
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:56,229
and my quirks and mannerisms, and...

62
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:00,078
Not that I have
anything to hide because, you know...

63
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:04,557
But there are a few disgusting
little moments that I regret.

64
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:07,478
It's just gossip.
Gossip is the new pornography.

65
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:10,956
- You should never let me drink.
- I know.

66
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:13,230
You should never let <i>yourself</i> drink.

67
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:15,920
We oughta go
cos I've got an exam tomorrow.

68
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:18,395
Oh, do you? The kid's gotta get up...

69
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:23,392
She's got homework.
I'm dating a girl who does homework.

70
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:26,790
What is it? What's the matter with you?

71
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:30,754
You... you... Where are you now?
Your mind is like a million miles away.

72
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:32,836
I have something I wanna say.

73
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:35,758
l, uh, I just didn't know
quite how to... get into it.

74
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:37,836
Um, l, uh...

75
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:42,912
About seven or eight weeks ago
I went to this dinner party

76
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:44,996
and I met a woman there.

77
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:47,950
And...

78
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:52,517
- And I've got kind of involved with her.
- You're kidding?

79
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:56,189
It started out very casually.
I mean, we had lunch a couple of times.

80
00:06:56,320 --> 00:07:00,598
And now it's, you know, it's getting out of
hand and I don't know what to do about it.

81
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,756
I mean, I'm... It's scary.

82
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:05,792
Well, who is she? What are the details?

83
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:07,876
Well, she's a journalist.

84
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,718
She's very...

85
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:12,195
- Is she married, too?
- No, no.

86
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:14,276
She's very beautiful.

87
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:18,474
She's very kind of
nervous, high-strung, illusive.

88
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:20,955
Great. It sounds wonderful.

89
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:25,278
Oh, she <i>is</i> wonderful.
I mean, she's on my mind all the time.

90
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:29,996
What are you telling me? That your
marriage is... I mean, how serious is it?

91
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:34,673
I don't know, but it's pretty serious.

92
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:38,110
- But you haven't said anything to Emily?
- No! God, no.

93
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:41,596
It's amazing. I'm stunned
because, of all the people I know,

94
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:45,679
I always thought for sure that you
and Emily had one of the best marriages.

95
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:48,075
We do! I mean, I love her.

96
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:50,509
- But you're seeing...
- I know it.

97
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:53,313
But in all the years
that we've been married

98
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:57,513
I've had, what... one or two
very minor things with other women.

99
00:07:57,640 --> 00:08:03,351
I mean, very... I hate the whole idea. I hate
myself when I'm doing this sort of thing.

100
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:06,438
But this is just, you know...
This is not like that.

101
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:09,870
It's terrible. Listen,
you shouldn't ask me for advice.

102
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,835
When it comes to relationships, I'm the
winner of the August Strindberg Award.

103
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:19,397
Well, I don't think 17 7 is too young.
Beside that, she's a bright girl.

104
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:22,751
You'll get no argument from me.
I think she's terrific.

105
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:25,997
He could do a lot worse.
He <i>has</i> done a lot worse.

106
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:28,270
I just think he's wasting his life.

107
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:31,358
He writes that crap for television.

108
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:36,150
Yale, have you ever thought
any more about having kids?

109
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:39,076
Oh, my God. Kids.

110
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:42,954
Listen, I've gotta get this book finished.
It's never gonna get done.

111
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:46,277
I've gotta get the money
to get this magazine started, huh?

112
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,958
Kids...

113
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:51,595
We always talk about moving to
Connecticut. You could do it there.

114
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:54,075
- Connecticut.
- Yeah.

115
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:57,317
I can't go to Connecticut. It's not practical.

116
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,396
All my stuff's here.

117
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:01,909
My work's here.
It's just the wrong time.

118
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:05,396
What about Isaac?
We can't abandon him, you know?

119
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:09,399
He can't function anywhere
other than New York, you know that.

120
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:11,476
Very Freudian.

121
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:31,551
- Are you writing a book on our marriage?
- Leave me alone.

122
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:35,878
- Are you writing about our break-up?
- We've said all that needs to be said.

123
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,753
I know you are because
I have a friend at Random House.

124
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:42,031
- I'm free to do as I please.
- Yeah, but this affects me.

125
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:45,709
So you're gonna tell everybody
everything? Our life, our sexual life?

126
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:47,193
Do you spy on me?

127
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:50,835
No. I was at a party and a guy said
he read an advance chapter

128
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:54,555
of a book my wife was writing,
and it was hot stuff. He said that!

129
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:58,434
- I spilled wine on my pants.
- I don't care to discuss it.

130
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:00,994
- You won't discuss it. How's Willie?
- Fine.

131
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:05,318
Well, give me some details. Does he
play baseball? Wear dresses? What?

132
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:09,797
He doesn't wear dresses. You'll find out
the details when it's your turn to see him.

133
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:12,798
Don't write this book.
It's a humiliating experience.

134
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:15,150
It's an honest account of our break-up.

135
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:18,352
Jesus, everybody that knows us
is gonna know everything.

136
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,630
Look at you. You're so threatened.

137
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:25,550
I'm not threatened because I was not
the immoral, psychotic, promiscuous one.

138
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:27,955
I hope I didn't leave out anything.

139
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:38,309
Are you telling me that... that... that I'm...
that you had three affairs before me?

140
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:41,796
That's really hard to believe.
It's mind-boggling.

141
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:45,879
When I was your age, I was still being
tucked in by my grandparents.

142
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,993
Well, they were really immature boys.
They were nothing like you.

143
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:52,076
No? What does that mean?

144
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:55,192
Well, I told you before.
I think I'm in love with you.

145
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:57,515
Hey, don't get carried away, OK?

146
00:10:57,640 --> 00:11:01,030
This is... This is a terrific thing
- Move over-you know.

147
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:06,598
And we're having a great time, but you're
a kid and I never want you to forget that.

148
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:09,553
You're gonna meet
a lot of terrific men in your life

149
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:11,750
and, you know, I want you to enjoy me.

150
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:15,793
My wry sense of humour
and astonishing sexual technique,

151
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:19,799
but never forget that you've...
you've got your whole life ahead of you.

152
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:22,036
Don't you have any feelings for me?

153
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:25,596
How can you ask that?
I've got nothing but feelings for you,

154
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:29,235
but you don't wanna get hung up
with one person at your age.

155
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:32,432
It's... charming, you know.

156
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:35,472
Erotic. No question about that.

157
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:39,832
As long as the cops don't burst in, I think
we're gonna break a couple of records.

158
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:43,191
But you can't, uh, you can't...
It's not a good thing.

159
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:47,472
You should think of me sort of
as a detour on the highway of life.

160
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:51,115
- So get dressed because you gotta go.
- Don't you want me to stay over?

161
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:53,390
I don't want you to get in the habit

162
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:58,355
because first you stay one night, then
two nights, and then you're living here.

163
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:01,074
- That doesn't sound too bad.
- It's not a great idea.

164
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:04,590
You won't like it, believe me.
I'm tough to get along with.

165
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:09,396
Tomorrow we'll go to the cinema and I'll
show you the Veronica Lake movie. OK?

166
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:13,035
OK. Veronica Lake's
the pin-up with the red hair?

167
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:16,914
No, that's Rita Hayworth.
Do we have to g<i>o o</i>ver this all the time?

168
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:20,669
- Rita who?
- Rita Hayworth. Are you joking with me?

169
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:25,351
Course I'm joking! You think I'm unaware
of any event pre-Paul McCartney.

170
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:30,997
- I find these photographs interesting.
- Yes, so do I.

171
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:34,635
- Do you ever use the camera I got you?
- Oh, yeah, I use it all the time.

172
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:38,275
I was taking pictures in our drama class.
It's fun, really neat.

173
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:41,119
You know you sound like
the mouse in <i>Tom And Jerry. </i>

174
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:42,593
Are you kidding me?

175
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:46,156
- You should talk! You've a whiny voice!
- You sound like the mouse.

176
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:48,032
Well, thanks.

177
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:51,152
I know, I'm a whiner.

178
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:55,353
- What are you doing here?
- Hi.

179
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:58,313
- How long have you been here?
- We were talking about you.

180
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:02,718
That's hilarious. Wh... What... Were you
walking around behind us or what?

181
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:05,957
- How are you? Hi.
- Good. That's funny. We were talking...

182
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:08,913
We're gonna go to
the Shakespeare In The Park thing.

183
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:10,996
Oh, yeah, right. I wanna do that.

184
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:14,556
Oh, this is my friend.
Mary Wilke, Isaac Davis and Tracy.

185
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:16,671
- How do you do?
- Hi. Nice to meet you.

186
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,028
You, too.

187
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:19,718
- Hello.
- Hi.

188
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:22,752
We were downstairs.
We saw the photography exhibition.

189
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:25,394
- Absolutely incredible.
- It's really good.

190
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:26,919
Really?

191
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:29,554
- The photographs downstairs?
- Yes.

192
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:34,629
- Great. Absolutely great. Did you?
- No, I really felt it was very derivative.

193
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:39,117
To me it looked like it was straight out of
Diane Arbus, but it had none of the wit.

194
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:42,789
Well, we didn't like it
as much as the Plexiglas sculpture.

195
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:44,638
You liked the Plexiglas?

196
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:50,630
- You didn't like the Plexiglas either?
- Ah, that's interesting. Nah, no...

197
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:54,150
It was a lot better than
that... that steel cube. Did you see it?

198
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:58,193
- Oh, yeah. That was the worst.
- Now that was brilliant to me.

199
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:00,276
- The cube was brilliant?
- Yes.

200
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:03,358
To me it was very textural.
You know what I mean?

201
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:08,031
It was perfectly integrated and it had a...
a marvellous kind of negative capability.

202
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:10,116
The rest of the stuff was bullshit.

203
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:16,793
- You wanna see the Sol Lewitt?
- Sure. That'd be fun.

204
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:18,273
You wanna see that?

205
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:21,790
He opens at the Modern soon. I was
gonna do a piece on Sol for <i>Insights. </i>

206
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:24,753
Do you know that magazine?
It's a little magazine.

207
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:28,839
They're such schmucks up there.
Really mired in Thirties radicalism.

208
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:31,235
- What do you do, Tracy?
- I go to high school.

209
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:36,115
Oh, really. Really. Somewhere Nabokov
is smiling, if you know what I mean.

210
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,515
LeWitt is overrated. In fact,
he may be a candidate for the academy.

211
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:41,914
Right!

212
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:46,113
Mary and I have invented the Academy
of the Overrated for such notables as

213
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:49,277
- Gustav Mahler,
- Isak Dinesen and Carl Jung.

214
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:52,756
- Scott Fitzgerald.
- Lenny Bruce. Can't forget him, can we?

215
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:56,509
- How about Norman Mailer?
- I think those people are all terrific.

216
00:14:56,640 --> 00:15:00,235
- Who was that guy you had?
- I didn't. It was yours. Heinrich B?l.

217
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:02,920
- Overrated?
- Don't wanna leave out Heinrich.

218
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:06,350
Gee, what about Mozart?
You guys don't wanna leave out Mozart.

219
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:10,155
- Well, how about Vincent Van <i>Goch? </i>
- She said "Van <i>Goch"?! </i>

220
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:12,475
- Or Ingmar Bergman?
- You'll get in trouble.

221
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:15,637
Bergman? Bergman's the only genius
in cinema today, I think.

222
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:17,512
He's a big Bergman fan.

223
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:21,315
God, you're so the opposite.
You write that fabulous television show.

224
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:24,159
It's so funny and
his view is so Scandinavian.

225
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:27,192
It's bleak, my God.
I mean, all that Kierkegaard, right?

226
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:32,155
Real adolescent, fashionable pessimism.
I mean, the silence. God's silence.

227
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:37,400
OK, OK, OK. I mean, I loved it when I was
at Radcliffe, but, all right, you outgrow it.

228
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:40,751
Get her away from me. I don't think
I can take too much more of her.

229
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:43,269
- She's really a cr...
- No. Don't you guys see?

230
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:46,915
It is the dignifying of one's
psychological and sexual hang-ups

231
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:50,749
by attaching them to these
grandiose, philosophical issues?

232
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:53,997
- Here we are.
- Listen, it was very nice meeting you.

233
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:56,873
It was a pleasure
and a sincere sensation,

234
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,833
but we have to go.
We gotta do some shopping. I forgot.

235
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:02,872
Hey, listen, I don't even
wanna have this conversation.

236
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:07,278
I'm just from Philadelphia, you know.
I mean, we believe in God so... OK?

237
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:09,914
What the hell does that mean?
What do you mean?

238
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:13,191
- Well, that...
- "I'm from Philadelphia. I believe in God."

239
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:16,073
Does this make any sense to you?

240
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:19,435
What a creep. Could you believe her?

241
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:21,994
- I mean, she was really...
- She seemed nervous.

242
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:26,477
Nervous? She was overbearing. She was,
you know, terrible! She was all cerebral.

243
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:30,832
Where the hell does a little Radcliffe
tootsie come off rating Scott Fitzgerald,

244
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:34,316
- Gustav Mahler and Heinrich B?l?
- Why are you getting so mad?

245
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:37,910
Because I don't like that
pseudo-intellectual garbage.

246
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:41,715
"Van <i>Goch!"</i> Did you hear that? She said
Van <i>Goch. </i> Like an Arab she spoke.

247
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:46,470
One more remark about Bergman, and I'd
have knocked her other contact lens out.

248
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:50,479
- Is she Yale's mistress?
- That will never cease to mystify me.

249
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:55,435
I mean, he's got a wonderful wife
and he prefers to... to diddle this yo-yo.

250
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:58,154
But he was always a sucker
for those kind of women.

251
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:02,671
The kind that would involve him
in discussions of existential reality.

252
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:05,951
They probably sit on the floor
with wine and cheese,

253
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:09,390
and mispronounce
"allegorical" and "didacticism".

254
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:12,080
I get the feeling that Yale really likes her.

255
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:15,078
Well, I don't believe
in extramarital relationships.

256
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:19,034
I think people should mate for life
like pigeons or Catholics.

257
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:23,919
I don't know. Maybe people weren't
meant to have one deep relationship.

258
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:28,158
Maybe we're meant to have a series
of relationships of different lengths.

259
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:32,068
- That's gone out of date.
- Don't tell me what's gone out of date.

260
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:35,636
You're 17 7. You were brought up
on drugs and television and the pill.

261
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:38,228
I... I was World War II.
I was in the trenches.

262
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:41,909
- You were eight in World War II.
- Right. I was never in the trenches.

263
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:45,350
I was caught right in the middle.
It was a very tough position.

264
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:47,391
Get the groceries, will you?

265
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:52,118
Good morning and welcome to
<i>Human Beings Wow! </i>

266
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:55,994
We're talking this evening with Gregory
and Caroline Payne Whitney Smith,

267
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:58,076
close friends of the Carter family.

268
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:01,158
We're normal people.
Just like you, we're in debt.

269
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:03,959
Except that Mrs Payne Whitney Smith
is a catatonic.

270
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:07,436
Well, we don't consider her
a catatonic, just quiet.

271
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:11,959
Jesus, this is the worst.
This is really embarrassing to me.

272
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:17,712
- I mean, I... This is so antiseptic...
- No, wrong. That's very chancy material.

273
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:21,116
- How do you see this as chancy?
- Who fights more with the censor?

274
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:25,313
What has the censor got to do with it?
There's no substance to the comedy.

275
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:29,399
- You don't find this insightful?
- Worse than not insightful. It's not funny.

276
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:32,193
- There's not a legitimate laugh.
- That's funny.

277
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:35,596
- Look at the audience.
- You're going by audience reaction?

278
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:37,676
This is an audience raised on TV.

279
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:40,872
Their standards have been lowered
over the years.

280
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:45,516
They watch their sets and the gamma
rays eat the white cells of their brains out.

281
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:49,349
- I quit. I can't write this any more.
- Relax. Take a lude.

282
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:54,156
I don't want a lude. All you do is drop
ludes, then Percodans and angel dust.

283
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:58,108
Naturally, it seems funny.
Anything would if you're...

284
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:01,869
You should abandon the show
and open a pharmaceutical house. I quit.

285
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,752
Ike, you're being silly.

286
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:07,794
<i>We've talked to them about that. </i>

287
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:10,275
- <i>Don't break her neck. </i>
- <i>I won't. That's fine. </i>

288
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,630
What did I do? I made a terrible mistake.

289
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:16,753
- It's the first smart thing you've done.
- I've screwed myself up completely.

290
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:21,476
For about 30 seconds I was a big hero,
and now it's directly to unemployment.

291
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:23,750
If you need money, I'll take care of it.

292
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:26,314
That's not the point.
I got enough for a year.

293
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:29,238
If I live like Mahatma Gandhi, I'm fine.

294
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:33,148
My accountant says I did this
at a very bad time. My stocks are down.

295
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:36,272
I'm cash poor or something.
I got no cash flow.

296
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:40,757
I'm not liquid, something's not flowing.
They got a language all their own.

297
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:44,316
We discussed this. It's difficult
to live here without a big income.

298
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:49,150
Yeah, plus I got two alimonies and
child support. You know, I gotta cut down.

299
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:51,276
I'll have to give up my apartment.

300
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:54,676
I'm not gonna be able to
play tennis, pick checks up at dinner,

301
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:56,756
or take the Southampton house.

302
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:03,272
Plus I'll probably have to give
my parents less money. It'll kill my father.

303
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:06,437
He's not gonna be able to get
as good a seat in the synagogue.

304
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:09,393
He'll be in the back, away from God,
far from the action.

305
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:11,476
Have you said anything to Tracy?

306
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:17,470
What is it... I gotta get out of that situation.
She's a young girl. What am I...? I'm...

307
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:20,319
You know, it's ridiculous. I mean, I...

308
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:24,590
What happens if the year goes by
and my book doesn't come out?

309
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:28,235
Your book is gonna come out.
Your book is gonna be wonderful.

310
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:32,273
The worst thing that can happen is
you'll learn something about yourself.

311
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:37,474
Listen, I'm really proud of you.
I mean, this is a <i>very</i> good move.

312
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:39,870
This is a wonderful turnout.

313
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:43,632
The Museum of Modern Art
has been very generous.

314
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:47,070
And the proof of the strength
of the Equal Rights Amendment

315
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:52,069
is that so many of you who would
never do it before put on black tie tonight.

316
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:59,348
We love you for it.
We need you and you've come through.

317
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:02,438
And now no more talk. Enjoy yourselves.

318
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:08,910
Hi. What are you doing here?

319
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:11,679
Congratulations on your book.
It was terrific.

320
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:13,995
- Oh, thanks.
- Absolutely terrific.

321
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:18,318
- Listen, I'd like you to meet Isaac Davis.
- Hi, how do you do? Isaac Davis.

322
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:21,910
- Isaac, hello. Hi.
- Wh-what are you doing here?

323
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:23,996
Well, of course I'm here.

324
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:28,750
What a funny coincidence.
Excuse me, Isaac Davis. We met before.

325
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:31,633
- I'm sorry.
- No, no, it's all right.

326
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:34,236
I heard you... quit your job.

327
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:38,319
Yeah. A real self-destructive impulse.
I wanna write a book, so I...

328
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:42,319
Has anybody read that Nazis are gonna
march in New Jersey, you know?

329
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:44,795
We should go there,
get some guys together.

330
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:47,992
Get some bricks and baseball bats
and explain things to 'em.

331
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:51,749
There was this devastating
satirical piece on that in the <i>Times. </i>

332
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:56,874
Well, a satirical piece in the <i>Times</i> is
one thing, but bricks get right to the point.

333
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,833
But biting satire
is better that physical force.

334
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:04,988
No, physical force is better with Nazis.
It's hard to satirise a guy with shiny boots.

335
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:08,715
- Well, you get emotional, but...
- We were talking about orgasms.

336
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:11,593
- Oh, no, please!
- Really? I'm sorry. I didn't...

337
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:15,030
I'm from Philadelphia.
We never talk about such things in public.

338
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:18,197
You said that before.
I don't know what it meant then either.

339
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:21,551
I'm just about to direct a film...
of my own script.

340
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:24,478
The premise is this guy screws so great...

341
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:26,750
- <i>Screws</i> so great?
- Screws so great

342
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:31,112
that when he brings a woman t<i>o o</i>rgasm,
she's so fulfilled that she dies.

343
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:34,198
Now this one, excuse me,
finds this hostile.

344
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:37,670
It's worse than hostile.
It's aggressive-homicidal.

345
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:41,793
You have to forgive Dennis.
He's Harvard direct to Beverly Hills.

346
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:45,469
It's... Theodor Reik
with a touch of Charles Manson.

347
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:50,919
I finally had an orgasm and my doctor
told me it was the wrong kind.

348
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,310
Did you have the wrong kind?
I've never had the wrong kind. Ever.

349
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:57,715
My worst one was right on the money.

350
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:06,876
- Good night. It was nice to meet you.
- Same here.

351
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,752
Bye-bye.

352
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:11,235
Oh, gee!

353
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:15,475
It's an interesting group of people.
Like the cast of a Fellini movie.

354
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:19,309
They're such fun, such wonderful people,
and Helen is a good friend.

355
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:22,512
She's a brilliant woman. She's a genius.

356
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:25,029
I met her through
my ex-husband Jeremiah.

357
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:27,913
How come you guys got divorced?
I never...

358
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:30,395
What do you mean
"How come we got divorced?"

359
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:33,114
What kind of a question is that?
I hardly know you.

360
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:37,995
- You don't have to tell me if you don't...
- Well, we had problems. We fought a lot.

361
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:42,875
I was tired of submerging my identity to
a brilliant, dominating man. He's a genius.

362
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:47,676
He was a genius, Helen's a genius, Dennis
is a genius. You know a lot of geniuses.

363
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:51,349
You should meet some stupid people.
You could learn something.

364
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:53,436
Well, why'd you get a divorce?

365
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:58,111
Why? I got a divorce because my ex-wife
left me for another woman.

366
00:23:58,240 --> 00:23:59,798
Really?

367
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:04,436
- God, that must have been demoralising.
- I took it well under the circumstances.

368
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:07,358
- Phew-wee.
- I tried to run 'em both over with a car.

369
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:09,710
That's incredible sexual humiliation.

370
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:13,389
It's enough to turn you off women
and it accounts for the little girl.

371
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:17,672
Hey, the little girl is fine.
Jesus, she's... What's with the little girl?

372
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:21,839
Oh, sure. I understand, believe me.
176 years old, no possible threat at all.

373
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:26,511
She's 17 7. She's gonna be eight...
Sometimes you have a losing personality.

374
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:30,792
I'm honest. I say what's on my mind
and if you can't take it, then fuck off.

375
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:34,469
I like the way you express yourself, too.
Pithy, yet degenerate.

376
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:37,831
- You get many dates? I don't think so.
- No, I do. I actually do.

377
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:39,996
I never thought I was very pretty.

378
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:44,910
Oh, what is pretty anyway? I hate being
pretty. It's all so subjective anyway.

379
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:48,589
The brightest men just drop dead
in front of a beautiful face.

380
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:52,599
When you climb into the sack,
if you're a bit giving, they're so grateful.

381
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:54,472
Yeah, I know I am.

382
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:56,556
- D'you have kids?
- Yeah.

383
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:58,750
He's being raised by two women.

384
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:03,476
I think it works. They made some studies,
I read in a psychoanalytic quarterly.

385
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:05,955
You don't need a male.
Two mothers are fine.

386
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:09,629
Really? Because I feel
very few people survive <i>one</i> mother.

387
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:13,878
Listen, I gotta get my dog. Wanna wait?
I gotta walk it. Are you in rush?

388
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:17,993
- Oh, no, sure. What kind of dog you got?
- The worst.

389
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:21,351
It's a dachshund.
You know, it's a penis substitute for me.

390
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:24,995
Oh, I would have thought then
in your case a Great Dane.

391
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:45,874
- So, you serious with Yale or what?
- Serious?

392
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:49,356
Well, he's married.

393
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:53,556
Uh, I don't know. I guess
I should straighten my life out, huh?

394
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:55,796
Donny my analyst always tells me...

395
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:59,435
- You call your analyst Donny?
- Yeah. I call him Donny!

396
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:03,917
I call mine Dr Chomsky, you know.
He hits me with a ruler.

397
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:06,596
Donny...? That's first name.

398
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:10,429
Donny says I get involved in situations
and that it's deliberate,

399
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:13,552
especially with my ex-husband Jeremiah.

400
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:15,432
I was his student and...

401
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:18,677
- Really? You married your teacher?
- Yeah, of course.

402
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:20,358
That's very...

403
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:23,631
- He failed me and I fell in love with him.
- Oh, that's perfect.

404
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:26,593
I was sleeping with him
and he had the nerve to give me an F.

405
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:28,472
- Really?
- Yeah, really.

406
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:31,592
Not even an Incomplete, right?
Just a straight F?

407
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:33,676
You got a good sense of humour.

408
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:37,349
Hey, thanks! I don't need you
to tell me that, you know.

409
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:41,632
I've been making good money off it for
years, till I quit my job to write this book.

410
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:44,991
Now I'm very, very nervous about it,
you know, but...

411
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:47,955
D'you wanna...?
Oh, you don't have to pay.

412
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:51,152
- Oh, that's OK.
- I'm serious! Wanna walk by the river?

413
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:53,430
- You know the time?
- What do you mean?

414
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:56,472
If I don't get at least 176 hours,
I'm a basket case.

415
00:26:56,600 --> 00:27:00,195
I'd like to hear about your book.
I really would. I'm quite a good editor.

416
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:01,878
Yeah?

417
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,151
Well, my book is about
decaying values. It's about...

418
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:09,876
See, years ago I wrote a short story about
my mother called <i>The Castrating Zionist</i>

419
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:14,278
and I wanna expand it into a novel.
I could talk about my book all night.

420
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:28,351
Isn't it beautiful out?

421
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:32,029
Yeah, it's really so pretty
when the light starts to come up.

422
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:34,116
I know. I love it.

423
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:39,638
Boy, this is really a great city.
I don't care what anybody says.

424
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:42,115
It's really a knockout, you know.

425
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:51,074
I think I better head back. I've got an
appointment with Yale for lunch later on.

426
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:14,949
Mm, hi.

427
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:17,036
No, no. No, I'm awake.

428
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:21,310
Jesus, what are you...
What are you doing? It's 7.17 5.

429
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:24,036
Oh, yeah.

430
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:27,552
Really?

431
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:30,236
You did? At the museum?

432
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:33,830
Yeah, well, she's very active
in the feminist movement.

433
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:37,591
So you're gonna go
apartment hunting with Tracy?

434
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:42,789
Yeah, well, you should be able
to find something. It's Isaac.

435
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:45,753
Yeah, I don't think you'll have any trouble.

436
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:51,034
I knew you'd... see she's a terrific
woman, if you spent some time with her.

437
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:55,836
You still feel the same way about her?
Cos you hadn't mentioned it in a while.

438
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:59,111
So you... Yeah.

439
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:04,918
Yeah... right. I know.

440
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:07,270
She's great, I know. Great.

441
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:11,518
So... No, I gotta go apartment hunting
today. I have to get something cheaper.

442
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:14,279
I can't keep living where I do.
It's just...

443
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:21,948
- Isaac's terrific, isn't he?
- Yeah.

444
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:24,036
Said he had a great time with you.

445
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:27,835
Really? That's good cos I always think
he's uncomfortable around me.

446
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:29,916
Oh, come on.

447
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:34,795
- I missed you so much.
- Yale, this is ridiculous. You're married.

448
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:38,071
Listen to me. I'm beginning
to sound like one of those women.

449
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:40,156
It sounds terrible. I hate it.

450
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:45,752
- Why don't I just move out?
- No! I don't wanna break up a marriage.

451
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:50,032
Besides, I'm not looking for any
big involvement here. It's just... I don't...

452
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:54,153
It's crazy. It's crazy. I think about you
when you're not around.

453
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:58,474
- What do you want me to do?
- Nothing. I don't know.

454
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:02,149
I just guess I should be seeing
someone who's not married.

455
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:05,636
- You're so beautiful. You make me crazy.
- Oh, Yale, please stop it.

456
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:08,832
We're in Bloomingdale's
and someone's gonna see us.

457
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:11,758
Did I tell you I may have
an interview with Borges?

458
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:16,749
I told you that we met before. He seems
to feel very comfortable around me.

459
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:21,351
- Let's go somewhere and make love.
- Not now! Not now, Jesus.

460
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:25,439
Anyway, you've got a writing class in
an hour. Your students are gonna know.

461
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:29,473
You're gonna have
this big grin on your face.

462
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:34,355
And I don't wanna go to your house cos I
can't stand the dog and the phone ringing.

463
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:38,553
Can't you hold me? Does your love for me
always have to express itself sexually?

464
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:43,276
What about other values like warmth
and spiritual contact? Hotel, right?

465
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:45,356
Jesus, I'm a pushover!

466
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:49,318
Oh, hi, Isaac.

467
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:52,318
- Hi. Is Willie ready?
- Yeah. Come on in.

468
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:54,396
He'll be right down.

469
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:57,273
- How you been, lke?
- Good. How you been?

470
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:59,356
- I've been terrific.
- Yeah?

471
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:03,155
Yeah. Been getting a lot of work done.
Things are going really well.

472
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:07,068
- Want some coffee or something?
- Uh, no. How's Willie doing?

473
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:10,749
Willie's fine. He's beginning
to show some real talent in drawing.

474
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:13,952
Where does he get that?
Cos you don't draw and I don't draw.

475
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:15,433
I draw.

476
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:18,791
Yeah, but there's no way that
you could be the actual father.

477
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:24,632
I'm hoping you'll take Willie on the 176th
cos Connie and I want to go to Barbados.

478
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:29,276
Are you still gonna write that stupid book?
I mean, are you serious about that?

479
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:33,757
I'm very serious about it. It's an honest
book. You have nothing to be ashamed of.

480
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:36,633
- Excuse me.
- Can I talk to you a minute? Excuse me.

481
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:39,957
Here's what I still don't understand.
Where are you running?

482
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:42,958
I can't understand
how you can prefer her to me.

483
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:44,832
- You can't understand?
- No.

484
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:46,712
You knew my history!

485
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:51,152
I know. My analyst warned me, but you
were so beautiful I got another analyst.

486
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:55,114
- D'you think we can be ever just friends?
- You're putting in all the details?

487
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:58,232
No, not the part where
you tried to run her over with the car.

488
00:31:58,360 --> 00:32:00,715
Wha... I tried to run her over with a car?

489
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:04,230
What are you talking about?
It was late. You know I don't drive well.

490
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:06,316
It was raining. It was dark.

491
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:08,635
Why were you lurking outside the cabin?

492
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:13,038
I was spying on you guys cos I knew what
was happening. You were falling in love.

493
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:15,674
So you felt you had to
run her over with the car?

494
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:19,315
Do I look like that type of person?
You know how slowly I was going?

495
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:22,352
Not slowly enough
that you didn't rip the front porch off.

496
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:26,917
Get the kid. I can't... I can't have
this argument every time I come over.

497
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:04,635
- You look funny in that jacket.
- I know.

498
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:07,911
I had hoped for something
in the gabardine.

499
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:10,190
- So, do you miss me?
- Yeah. Do you miss me?

500
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:14,029
Of course I miss you. I love you. That's
why I come and get you all the time.

501
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:18,278
- Why can't we have frankfurters?
- Because this is a Russian tearoom.

502
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:22,279
I mean, you wanna have a blintz or
something. Frankfurter gives you cancer.

503
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:26,757
Besides, you see those two women here?
They have very beautiful women here.

504
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:31,556
We could do well. I think we could have
picked up these two, if you were quicker.

505
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:33,636
I'm serious.

506
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:36,510
I think the brunette liked you.

507
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:42,512
I think I should, uh...
No, I'll call him.

508
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:55,358
Hello, Yale? I'm sorry for calling.

509
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:58,835
Well, no, no, nothing's wrong. I...

510
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:03,071
Well, I just thought that it's Sunday out

511
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:08,274
and maybe if you could get away,
we could go for a walk or...

512
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:15,709
Oh, that's right. You mentioned that.
Well, OK, it was just a shot. Yeah. Yeah.

513
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:18,991
Well, I won't keep you. OK. Bye-bye.

514
00:34:24,680 --> 00:34:26,432
Hello?

515
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:29,640
Oh, hi! Hi, how you doin'?

516
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:35,989
No, not at all. I was just sitting around
looking through the magazine section.

517
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:41,630
Uh, no, no, I didn't read the piece
on China's faceless masses.

518
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:44,149
I was checking out the lingerie ads.

519
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:47,192
Yeah, I can never get past them.
They're really erotic.

520
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:49,276
You wanna go for a walk?

521
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:55,275
I don't know, I've gotta get out. I'm going
stir-crazy and Yale's with Emily's parents.

522
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:57,675
It's such a beautiful Sunday.

523
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:02,871
It's an electrical storm.
You wanna wind up in an ashtray?

524
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,560
- It was such a beautiful day out.
- Yeah, wonderful.

525
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:07,830
I think the Chrysler Building blew up.

526
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:11,839
- Oh, no! Thunder scares me.
- It's not my favourite sound either.

527
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:16,351
D'you know every year one or two people
get killed during a storm in Central Park?

528
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:18,948
Why don't I run up ahead
and we'll talk later?

529
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:36,596
Jesus Christ, I'm soaking wet.
This is awful!

530
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:38,756
You look ridiculous! You know that?

531
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:42,350
Next time you want someone
to walk with you, get somebody else.

532
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:45,995
I've never seen anybody
react so strongly to a little bit of water.

533
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:48,680
It wasn't the water. It was the electricity.

534
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:52,110
I'll turn into a guy that sells
comics outside Bloomingdale's.

535
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:55,277
What do you think?
You think I look terrible? How do I look?

536
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:58,915
- I can't see.
- You should see your face!

537
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:02,396
You look kinda nice, actually.
You're sort of pretty.

538
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:06,032
- I'm really annoyed with Yale.
- Why?

539
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:08,958
He was supposed to see me today
and then he couldn't.

540
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:12,959
And I had tickets to this Vivaldi concert.
He had to cancel on me, of course.

541
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:17,039
- That's what happens when...
- I know. You're having an affair.

542
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:20,357
- What a terrible way to put it.
- Hey, I didn't put it that way.

543
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:24,155
My husband, well, my ex-husband,
had an affair when we were married.

544
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:26,919
- Really?
- Yeah. At least one that I know of.

545
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:31,113
And I never mentioned anything because
I felt that I was deficient in some way.

546
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:35,279
That I was bad in bed, not bright enough,
or physically unattractive.

547
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:39,154
- But in the end he was just a louse.
- Yeah, I know. An intellectual louse.

548
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:42,317
Oh, God, was he brilliant.
I was so crazy about him.

549
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:45,273
Really opened me up sexually.
Taught me everything.

550
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:47,356
Women found him devastating.

551
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:50,510
Oh, look. There's Saturn.

552
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:53,029
Saturn is the sixth planet from the sun.

553
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:56,118
How many of the satellites of Saturn
can you name?

554
00:36:56,240 --> 00:37:01,030
There's Mimas, Titan, Dione.
Hyperion, of course.

555
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:05,153
I can't name any of 'em and fortunately
they never come up in conversation.

556
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:07,840
Facts.
I got a million facts at my fingertips.

557
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:12,511
They mean nothing cos nothing worth
knowing is understood with the mind.

558
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:15,757
Everything valuable enters
through a different opening,

559
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:18,348
if you'll forgive the disgusting imagery.

560
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:21,870
I don't agree at all. Where would we be
without rational thought?

561
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:25,151
You... you... you rely too much
on your brain.

562
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:27,999
The brain is the most overrated organ.

563
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:31,590
I know. You probably think
I'm too cerebral.

564
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:34,871
Well, you are, you know,
kind of on the brainy side.

565
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:38,879
What's the difference what I think about
you? God knows what you think of me.

566
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,956
You're fine. Are you kidding?

567
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:44,868
You do have a tendency to get
a little hostile, but I find that attractive.

568
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:48,390
Oh, yeah? Well, I'm glad you do.

569
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:51,910
So, you think I have no feelings?
Is that it?

570
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:56,556
Hey, wha... You're so sensitive, Jesus!
I never said that.

571
00:37:57,440 --> 00:38:00,830
I think you're... I think you're terrific.

572
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:05,832
Really, you know. I... I...
You're very insecure.

573
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:08,520
I think you're wonderful, really.

574
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:12,875
What do you think?
It's probably stopped raining out.

575
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,719
You wanna grab a bite
or something like that?

576
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:21,396
I gotta see somebody this evening.
I don't know if it's a great idea.

577
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:24,398
Right. Well...
So what about sometime next week?

578
00:38:24,520 --> 00:38:27,751
I might give you a call,
if you have any free time?

579
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:36,758
I'm... I'm not gonna have any free time
cos... I don't think it's such a great idea.

580
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:42,318
I'm working on this book and it,
you know, takes a lot of my energy up.

581
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:44,271
OK. OK.

582
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:50,516
Your parents were in a good mood.
I almost had a good time.

583
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:53,950
- Who did you call after dinner?
- Oh, uh, David Cohen.

584
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:56,878
He wants me to review the new book
on Virginia Woolf.

585
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,753
Written another one, if you can believe it.

586
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:03,518
- Are you OK?
- Yeah, I'm fine. What do you mean?

587
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:07,235
- You seem sort of nervous.
- No, I'm not. I feel good.

588
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:10,875
- I was gonna ask <i>you</i> how you felt.
- No. I'm OK.

589
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:15,278
- You seemed strange at dinner.
- Ah, just more thoughts about kids.

590
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:17,356
Oh, come on.

591
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:23,873
Listen, I told Cohen I'd stop by and
pick up the book. Is that OK with you?

592
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,718
Yeah.

593
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:27,433
It's not too crowded.

594
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:30,996
No, not bad for Sunday.
I thought it'd be jammed.

595
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:36,353
Gee, I'm glad you could get out tonight
cos... I really did wanna see you a lot.

596
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:39,950
I like it when you get
an uncontrollable urge.

597
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:42,116
Yeah, I know, it's my best feature.

598
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:46,199
My boyish impetuosity.
It's my... You look adorable.

599
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:48,276
So I have a chance to go to London,

600
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:51,039
study with the Academy
of Music and Dramatic Arts.

601
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:55,438
- Really? When did this happen?
- The other day. Got a letter in the mail.

602
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:58,677
Well, that's great. That's terrific.

603
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:01,553
But I don't wanna go without you.

604
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:03,875
Hey, I can't go to London and study.

605
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:07,549
Especially Shakespeare.
You know, I don't look good in leotards.

606
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:11,514
- I'm serious.
- Of course you should go. It's great.

607
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:13,198
You'll have a great time.

608
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:18,474
It's a great town and you're a wonderful
actress and it's a terrific place to study.

609
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:22,070
You'll be the toast of the town.
You'll have a good time, really.

610
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:25,795
- You shouldn't pass that...
- So what happens to us?

611
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:28,798
Well, you know, we'll always have Paris.

612
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:30,672
I'm kidding.

613
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:33,872
What kind of question is that?
You can't think of that now.

614
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,798
You won't take me seriously
just because I'm 17 7.

615
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:40,959
Yeah, exactly, because you're 17 7.
I mean, it's ridiculous.

616
00:40:41,080 --> 00:40:43,548
You're 17 7 now. When you're 36, I'll be...

617
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:47,238
63.

618
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:49,510
63, right. Thank you.

619
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:53,428
You know, it's absurd. You'll be
at the height of your sexual powers.

620
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:55,755
Of course, I will too probably, but,

621
00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:57,916
you know, I'm a late starter.

622
00:40:58,040 --> 00:40:59,996
- Wh<i>o o</i>rdered the plain pie?
- Me.

623
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:02,998
So you must be anchovies,
sausage, mushrooms, peppers.

624
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:05,996
Forgot the coconut.

625
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:11,954
So what do you wanna do tonight? We'll
go to the movies, I'll take you dancing...

626
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:14,310
- Anything?
- Absolutely anything.

627
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:16,396
OK, I know what we can do.

628
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:20,638
- Well, get the filthy look off your face.
- Shut up. It's not filthy.

629
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:40,036
This is so corny. I can't believe this.
Is this what you wanted to do?

630
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:42,674
I don't think it's corny.
I think it's fun!

631
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:45,394
It is fun, but I did this
when I was a kid, you know.

632
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:48,239
Well, I've never done it. I think it's great.

633
00:41:48,360 --> 00:41:52,512
On my prom night I went
around this park five times, six times.

634
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:56,519
If I had been with a girl, this would
have been an incredible experience.

635
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:13,399
Quit fighting it.
You know you're crazy about me.

636
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:16,910
I am. You're... You're God's answer to Job.

637
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:19,838
You would have ended
all argument between them.

638
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:24,829
He'd have said "I do a lot of terrible things
but I can also make one of these."

639
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:27,520
And Job would've said "OK, you win."

640
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:41,713
Look, this is crazy. I just can't do this
any more. It's really bullshit!

641
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:45,071
You're married and
I expected to see you this weekend

642
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:49,352
and I sit around like I've nothing to do,
so I called Isaac. We went for a walk.

643
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:52,916
- It was just lucky he was free.
- I know. I'm sorry.

644
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:56,919
Oh, it's not your fault.
What the hell. It's a no-win situation.

645
00:42:57,040 --> 00:43:00,077
It's just I'm beautiful and I'm bright
and I deserve better!

646
00:43:00,200 --> 00:43:01,474
I know.

647
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:04,433
- What if I took some action?
- No!

648
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:06,516
I'm not a home wrecker.

649
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:09,950
I don't know how I got into this.
I guess we met at the wrong time.

650
00:43:10,080 --> 00:43:12,036
It happens. Hello?

651
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:14,913
Oh, hi. Oh, hi, Harvey. How are you?

652
00:43:15,720 --> 00:43:16,994
What?

653
00:43:17,120 --> 00:43:22,148
Well... why don't you bring it by
on Thursday and I'll read it then, OK?

654
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:27,400
Yeah, yeah, yeah, OK.
Right, I'll talk to you later. OK, bye-bye.

655
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:30,671
- What d'you want me to do?
- Waffles. Nothing. It's just...

656
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:35,157
Waffles! Will you stop that now?
We're just going noplace. Excuse me.

657
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:39,990
Look, I know it's terrible. I'm at Sneedon's
Landing with Emily and her parents

658
00:43:40,120 --> 00:43:43,556
and I love her!
And I'm thinking about you all the time.

659
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:47,195
I don't wa... Christ. I don't wanna hear it.

660
00:43:47,360 --> 00:43:50,432
I'm from Philadelphia.
My family's never had affairs.

661
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:54,712
My parents have been married 43 years.
Nobody cheats at all. Hello?

662
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:57,274
Oh, Donny. Hi! It's my analyst.

663
00:43:57,400 --> 00:43:59,356
Hello.

664
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:04,279
No...
Well, I think that'd be impossible.

665
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:08,916
OK, well, probably later in the week.
OK, all right.

666
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:11,600
I'll get back to you. OK, bye.

667
00:44:11,720 --> 00:44:14,154
Oh, man. Waffles!

668
00:44:14,280 --> 00:44:18,876
Please, just don't. This is really
a bad time... Waffles! ...a bad time for me.

669
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,116
I gotta think things through here.

670
00:44:23,880 --> 00:44:27,429
- Obviously I shouldn't have come here.
- Well, no, probably not.

671
00:44:55,240 --> 00:44:57,356
Listen to that! How am I gonna...?

672
00:44:57,480 --> 00:45:01,109
What is that sound? Can you hear that?
Listen. Where's it coming from?

673
00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:04,437
It's like somebody's playing the trumpet.

674
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:09,270
Or somebody sawing... Like a man
sawing a trumpet in half. Right? Right?

675
00:45:09,400 --> 00:45:11,436
- Let's fool around.
- You hear it?

676
00:45:11,640 --> 00:45:13,471
It'll take your mind off it.

677
00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:17,115
How many times a night...? How often
can you make love in an evening?

678
00:45:17,240 --> 00:45:20,038
- Well, a lot.
- Yeah, I can tell. A lot. That's...

679
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:23,152
Well, a lot is my favourite number.
Gee, really? Can you?

680
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:26,352
Let's do it some strange way
you've always wanted to do,

681
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:28,436
but nobody would do with you.

682
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:31,950
I'm shocked. What kind of talk is that
from a kid your age?

683
00:45:32,080 --> 00:45:35,038
I'll get my scuba-diving equipment
and really show you...

684
00:45:35,160 --> 00:45:38,038
- Take me seriously!
- I do take you seriously, but...

685
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:41,516
Listen to this. Am I crazy? Wha...? Ah!

686
00:45:41,640 --> 00:45:45,713
It's a rumbling. Listen to that goddamn...
Where the hell is that coming from?

687
00:45:45,840 --> 00:45:51,039
- It's probably just the elevator shaft.
- It's not. It's coming from the walls.

688
00:45:51,160 --> 00:45:53,720
Let's... Let's... Can we check into a hotel?

689
00:45:53,840 --> 00:45:56,513
- Oh, you're crazy!
- I can't sleep here. I can't.

690
00:45:56,640 --> 00:45:58,870
Where's the aspirin? What d'you do...

691
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,833
I can help you fix this place up,
if you give me a chance.

692
00:46:01,960 --> 00:46:04,269
No, and I don't want you living here.

693
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:08,359
Tonight is a special occasion.
It's my first night in the apartment,

694
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:12,075
so I wanted to break in the place
and I was afraid to sleep alone.

695
00:46:12,680 --> 00:46:15,114
Hey, what is this?
There's brown water!

696
00:46:15,240 --> 00:46:18,357
- The pipes are rusty.
- What is this, Tracy?

697
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:21,836
- The pipes are rusty.
- Look at this. It's brown water.

698
00:46:21,960 --> 00:46:25,555
I'm paying $700 a month.
I got rats with bongos and a frog.

699
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:27,636
And I got brown water here.

700
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:30,672
- Look. It's disgusting.
- What's gonna happen to us?

701
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:34,190
Listen. You keep ignoring me.
What's gonna happen with us?

702
00:46:34,320 --> 00:46:37,869
What do you mean?
D'you have a good time with me?

703
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:41,754
- Aren't I a load of laughs and fun?
- Yes.

704
00:46:41,880 --> 00:46:44,155
So, and that's it, and we have fun.

705
00:46:44,280 --> 00:46:47,431
Then you're gonna go to London
exactly as we discussed it.

706
00:46:47,560 --> 00:46:51,917
You're gonna take advantage of that
opportunity and study acting over there.

707
00:46:52,040 --> 00:46:55,953
And you'll think of me always
as a fond memory. It'll be nice.

708
00:46:56,080 --> 00:46:58,674
You know we have to
stop seeing each other?

709
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:01,155
Oh, yeah. Right, right.

710
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:04,875
I understand. I could tell by
the sound of your voice over the phone.

711
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:09,357
Very authoritative, you know.
Like the Pope or the computer in <i>2001.</i>

712
00:47:09,480 --> 00:47:12,233
It's not fair to you
and I don't know what I'm doing.

713
00:47:12,360 --> 00:47:14,794
- Right.
- I mean... Come on, don't be angry.

714
00:47:14,920 --> 00:47:18,356
You brought this up. You're not happy
the way things are going.

715
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:23,998
I'm not angry. It's just I knew it was gonna
end, but now it's happened I'm upset, OK?

716
00:47:24,120 --> 00:47:26,554
Look, you don't wanna
make a commitment.

717
00:47:26,680 --> 00:47:30,958
And I don't wanna break up my marriage
and then find out we're no good together.

718
00:47:31,080 --> 00:47:33,310
I've gotta start thinking about Emily.

719
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:38,309
OK, you made your point very clear. I'm
just glad one of us had the nerve to end it.

720
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:41,760
- Will you be all right?
- Yeah...

721
00:47:41,880 --> 00:47:45,156
Of course I will. What d'you think
I'm gonna do? Hang myself?

722
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:48,590
I'm a beautiful woman.
I'm young, highly intelligent.

723
00:47:48,720 --> 00:47:51,280
I got everything going for me. The point...

724
00:47:51,960 --> 00:47:56,351
The point is that... I don't know,
I'm all fucked up. I'm just... Shit!

725
00:47:56,480 --> 00:48:00,951
What am I doing in this relationship
anyway? My phone never stops ringing.

726
00:48:01,080 --> 00:48:05,756
I could go to bed with the entire faculty
of MIT, if I wanted to. It's just...

727
00:48:05,880 --> 00:48:09,395
I don't know. I'm wasting myself
on a married man, so I don't know.

728
00:48:11,080 --> 00:48:14,834
Listen, I think I'd better go now.
I just want you to have this.

729
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:19,476
- I got these tickets to see Rampal tonight.
- Oh, Mary. This is very hard on me, too.

730
00:48:19,600 --> 00:48:22,114
Please! Just take them
and go with your wife.

731
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:26,119
Mary, you love Rampal.
Call somebody up. Take Isaac.

732
00:48:26,240 --> 00:48:28,196
Fuck off, Yale!

733
00:48:29,360 --> 00:48:34,309
I know you're gonna think the water's
a little brown, but you can drink it.

734
00:48:34,440 --> 00:48:36,396
Don't get thrown by this.

735
00:48:36,520 --> 00:48:39,478
- I'm really sorry for bothering you.
- No problem.

736
00:48:39,600 --> 00:48:44,549
- It's just... God, this is brown, isn't it?
- It is, but you get used to it after a while.

737
00:48:44,680 --> 00:48:46,432
I didn't know who to call.

738
00:48:46,560 --> 00:48:49,358
I don't think you should take Valium.
It causes cancer.

739
00:48:49,480 --> 00:48:52,916
- No. Half a Valium?
- Yeah, abdominal cancer, I think.

740
00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:54,996
When did they find that out?

741
00:48:55,120 --> 00:48:58,999
That's just my theory, but I think
it's correct. I got tissues someplace.

742
00:48:59,120 --> 00:49:02,237
- Well, I guess I deserve everything I get.
- Come on.

743
00:49:02,360 --> 00:49:06,273
It's true. It's really true. I mean,
I knew it couldn't possibly work out.

744
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:08,356
Yeah, you pick a married guy

745
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:11,995
and when it doesn't work out,
it confirms your worst feelings.

746
00:49:12,120 --> 00:49:14,076
What worst feelings?

747
00:49:14,200 --> 00:49:19,035
You know. Your feelings about men
and marriage and that nothing works.

748
00:49:19,160 --> 00:49:22,596
Oh, please, don't psychoanalyse me.
I pay a doctor for that.

749
00:49:22,720 --> 00:49:26,838
Hey. You call that guy
that you talk to a doctor?

750
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:32,398
You don't get suspicious when he calls
you at 3am and weeps into the telephone?

751
00:49:32,520 --> 00:49:35,273
So he's unorthodox.
He's a highly qualified doctor.

752
00:49:35,400 --> 00:49:39,552
He's done a great job on you. Your
self-esteem is like a notch below Kafka's.

753
00:49:39,680 --> 00:49:41,671
What is that noise?

754
00:49:41,800 --> 00:49:46,112
Yeah. Incredible, isn't it? There's a guy
upstairs. I don't know what the hell it is.

755
00:49:46,240 --> 00:49:50,119
It's like he's up there strangling a parrot
or something. I can't stand it.

756
00:49:50,240 --> 00:49:54,279
- How can you stand it? It's terrible.
- I know. I used to have a great apartment.

757
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:58,632
- Wanna go for a walk? It's quieter out.
- No, I think I'll just go home.

758
00:49:58,760 --> 00:50:00,716
No, come on.

759
00:50:02,040 --> 00:50:05,999
He led me on! That's the point of it.
Why am I reluctant to criticise him?

760
00:50:06,120 --> 00:50:08,953
Relax. Yale would not do that.
He's not that kind of a guy.

761
00:50:09,080 --> 00:50:12,197
Don't defend him.
You guys all stick up for each other.

762
00:50:12,320 --> 00:50:17,792
Yale has his problems as we all do.
I'm starting to sound like Rabbi Blitzstein.

763
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:21,879
Well, thanks for letting me come over.
I appreciate it. It's very nice of you.

764
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:25,197
Tracy and I are going out tonight,
if you wanna come along.

765
00:50:25,320 --> 00:50:27,675
Oh, no, I'll be fine. I'll be OK.

766
00:50:27,800 --> 00:50:29,358
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

767
00:50:29,480 --> 00:50:33,758
- That's a healthy piece of towel paper.
- Oh, gee. God!

768
00:50:33,880 --> 00:50:35,836
Well, goodbye. Thanks a lot.

769
00:50:37,520 --> 00:50:41,115
<i>But my point is a cab driver</i>
<i>doesn't make enough money... </i>

770
00:50:41,240 --> 00:50:45,870
Oh, look at that... that guy's toupee.
That's unbelievable.

771
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:50,790
That is hilarious. There's a... a...
an inch of cheesecloth. You can see it.

772
00:50:50,920 --> 00:50:54,310
I don't know why, you know,
his loved ones don't tell him.

773
00:50:54,440 --> 00:50:58,672
It's like the toupee dropped on his head
from a window ledge as he was walking.

774
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:03,237
But look at his wife. Looks like her face
has been lifted about 8,000 times.

775
00:51:03,360 --> 00:51:06,352
I know. It's so plastic. It's so tight.

776
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:08,835
I hate that. I just hate that. I wish...

777
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:12,669
Why can't they just age naturally
instead of putting all that junk on?

778
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:15,360
I know. Old faces are... are nice.

779
00:51:15,480 --> 00:51:17,630
Yeah. They're great.

780
00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:24,914
Hey, be careful. I think
I got black bean sauce in the bed.

781
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:28,316
Oh, look. It's great.
The late show's a WC Fields film.

782
00:51:30,680 --> 00:51:32,636
Oh, great. We gotta watch that.

783
00:51:35,280 --> 00:51:37,032
Oh, God.

784
00:51:37,800 --> 00:51:41,156
Boy, I really feel good, you know.
I got my life together finally.

785
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:42,633
Yeah?

786
00:51:42,760 --> 00:51:47,675
You know, I just had to cut this thing off
finally. I'm not the type for affairs.

787
00:51:47,800 --> 00:51:52,396
- D'you ever hear from Mary, or see her?
- No. We just cut it off. It's easier that way.

788
00:51:52,520 --> 00:51:56,069
She's terrific. She deserves more
than a fling with a married guy.

789
00:51:56,200 --> 00:52:00,876
- Yeah, she's screwed up, but great.
- Right up your alley. You oughta call her.

790
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:03,309
- I... I should call her?
- Yeah.

791
00:52:03,440 --> 00:52:05,874
- Why should I call her?
- Because she likes you.

792
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:07,956
She told me she did.

793
00:52:08,080 --> 00:52:11,436
- You're crazy.
- No. She said she finds you attractive.

794
00:52:11,560 --> 00:52:14,358
- She said she found me attractive?
- Yeah.

795
00:52:14,480 --> 00:52:17,756
- When was this?
- She said it when she first met you.

796
00:52:17,880 --> 00:52:20,440
- I didn't know. I can't.
- Sorry about that.

797
00:52:20,560 --> 00:52:23,393
I always think of you guys together.
I couldn't...

798
00:52:23,520 --> 00:52:26,796
It's over. Unless you're serious
about Tracy. Are you?

799
00:52:26,920 --> 00:52:29,957
- No. Tracy's too young.
- Then call her up.

800
00:52:30,080 --> 00:52:34,870
Listen, she's an unhappy person.
I mean, she needs something in her life.

801
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:39,232
- I think you guys would be good together.
- I could be a good influence on her.

802
00:52:39,360 --> 00:52:44,229
I think that under my personal vibrations,
I could put her life in a kind of good order.

803
00:52:44,360 --> 00:52:49,434
That's what you said about Jill, and she
went from bisexuality to homosexuality.

804
00:52:49,560 --> 00:52:52,632
Yeah, but I gave it
the old college try there for a while.

805
00:52:52,760 --> 00:52:56,355
- Listen, you should call her up.
- No kidding. What did she say about me?

806
00:52:56,480 --> 00:53:00,029
She said that she likes you very much.
She thinks you're smart.

807
00:53:00,160 --> 00:53:02,628
- She thinks you're...
- Keep going. Don't stop.

808
00:53:02,760 --> 00:53:05,115
- Attractive.
- Really? No kidding.

809
00:53:25,480 --> 00:53:28,711
You see, to me a great movie
is with WC Fields. That's what I like.

810
00:53:28,840 --> 00:53:33,277
Or <i>Grand Illusion. </i> That's... I see that every
time it's on television, if I'm aware of it.

811
00:53:33,400 --> 00:53:35,550
So what you got to eat here? Nothing.

812
00:53:35,680 --> 00:53:40,549
Oh, Jesus, what is this? You got a corned
beef sandwich here from 17 <i>9</i>517, I think.

813
00:53:40,680 --> 00:53:43,433
- Look at this. I mean...
- Yeah, I know, I know.

814
00:53:43,560 --> 00:53:46,916
- I don't have time to cook.
- Corned beef should not be blue.

815
00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:49,076
It's really terrible.

816
00:53:49,200 --> 00:53:50,553
- Hey.
- What?

817
00:53:50,680 --> 00:53:52,238
Come here.

818
00:53:58,160 --> 00:53:59,912
What're you doing?

819
00:54:00,040 --> 00:54:03,874
What am I doing? You have to ask?
I was kissing you flush on the mouth.

820
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:07,117
I... I cannot get my life
in any kind of order. It's just...

821
00:54:07,240 --> 00:54:10,152
- It's something I wanted to do for ages.
- Yeah, I know.

822
00:54:10,280 --> 00:54:14,592
Do you? Cos I... I thought I was hiding it.
I was trying to be real cool and casual.

823
00:54:14,720 --> 00:54:17,234
I thought you wanted to kiss me
at the planetarium.

824
00:54:17,360 --> 00:54:19,316
- I did.
- I thought so.

825
00:54:19,440 --> 00:54:24,719
But you were going out with Yale then and
I would never in a million years interfere...

826
00:54:24,840 --> 00:54:26,796
Did you want me to kiss you?

827
00:54:26,920 --> 00:54:30,833
I don't know what I wanted.
I was so angry at Yale that day.

828
00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:34,111
But you were so sexy.
You were soaking wet from the rain

829
00:54:34,240 --> 00:54:37,915
and I had a mad impulse
to throw you down on the lunar surface

830
00:54:38,040 --> 00:54:40,998
and commit
interstellar perversion with you.

831
00:54:41,120 --> 00:54:45,591
I can't go from relationship to
relationship. It's senseless. I can't do it.

832
00:54:45,720 --> 00:54:49,030
Well, what... Are you still
hung up on Yale? Is that the problem?

833
00:54:49,160 --> 00:54:51,116
I've got too many problems.

834
00:54:51,240 --> 00:54:54,755
I'm really not the person
to get involved with. I'm trouble.

835
00:54:54,880 --> 00:54:59,192
- Hey, honey, Trouble is my middle name.
- What are you saying?

836
00:54:59,320 --> 00:55:01,754
Actually, my middle name is Mortimer.

837
00:55:01,880 --> 00:55:03,836
I'm... I'm kidding.

838
00:55:06,360 --> 00:55:09,636
My problem is I'm both attracted
and repelled by the male organ.

839
00:55:11,160 --> 00:55:14,232
So it doesn't make for
good relationships with men.

840
00:55:14,360 --> 00:55:16,715
What about your relationships
with women?

841
00:55:16,840 --> 00:55:19,798
You never really told me much
about your first wife.

842
00:55:19,920 --> 00:55:23,071
My first wife was
a kindergarten teacher, you know.

843
00:55:23,200 --> 00:55:26,590
She got into drugs
and she... moved to San Francisco.

844
00:55:26,720 --> 00:55:28,676
Went into est, became a Moonie.

845
00:55:28,800 --> 00:55:31,075
She's with
the William Morris Agency now.

846
00:55:31,200 --> 00:55:32,758
D'you like that?

847
00:55:32,880 --> 00:55:36,589
This... this, I think, has a kind of
wonderful otherness to it, you know.

848
00:55:36,720 --> 00:55:39,439
- A marvellous negative capability.
- OK.

849
00:55:39,560 --> 00:55:42,313
Kind of wonderful energy to it,
don't you think?

850
00:55:49,320 --> 00:55:52,676
I thought that wine
was wonderful, didn't you think?

851
00:55:52,800 --> 00:55:55,712
And it just made my face
all flushed and hot.

852
00:55:55,840 --> 00:56:00,038
Yeah. You look so beautiful
I can hardly keep my eyes on the meter.

853
00:56:01,160 --> 00:56:02,718
It's 17 4 bucks!

854
00:56:02,840 --> 00:56:05,798
I know, but it was a great restaurant.
Didn't you love it?

855
00:56:05,920 --> 00:56:10,198
Yeah, I love seafood. Course I'm drunk.
I don't know if you can tell or not.

856
00:56:10,320 --> 00:56:14,279
Hey, you know, it was the only time
in my life I ever had Chianti from Warsaw.

857
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:16,152
- Give me a kiss.
- OK.

858
00:56:25,280 --> 00:56:26,838
What are you thinking?

859
00:56:26,960 --> 00:56:30,111
I was thinking there must be
something wrong with me

860
00:56:30,240 --> 00:56:32,708
because I've never had a relationship

861
00:56:32,840 --> 00:56:36,389
that's lasted longer than
the one between Hitler and Eva Braun.

862
00:56:36,520 --> 00:56:38,590
I think you're still drunk!

863
00:57:16,720 --> 00:57:18,836
It's great. It's... it's...

864
00:57:18,960 --> 00:57:23,715
I don't play the harmonica, but it's
an incredible... harmonica is what it is.

865
00:57:24,400 --> 00:57:28,996
Well, you said you wanted to learn.
I'm trying t<i>o o</i>pen up that side of you.

866
00:57:29,120 --> 00:57:32,954
Tracy, you're throwing away
an enormous amount of real affection

867
00:57:33,080 --> 00:57:35,036
on the wrong person.

868
00:57:35,160 --> 00:57:37,116
It's not wrong for me.

869
00:57:40,800 --> 00:57:45,191
Listen, I don't... I don't think
we should keep seeing each other.

870
00:57:45,320 --> 00:57:47,276
Why not?

871
00:57:47,400 --> 00:57:50,915
Because I think you're getting
too hung up on me, you know?

872
00:57:51,040 --> 00:57:53,554
"Hung up on me."
I'm starting to sound like you.

873
00:57:53,680 --> 00:57:55,955
I'm not hung up on you.
I'm in love with you.

874
00:57:56,080 --> 00:57:58,514
You can't be in love with me.
We've been over this.

875
00:57:58,640 --> 00:58:02,235
You're a kid. You don't know what
love means. I don't know what it means.

876
00:58:02,360 --> 00:58:04,510
Nobody knows what the hell's going on.

877
00:58:04,640 --> 00:58:07,200
We have laughs together.
I care about you.

878
00:58:07,320 --> 00:58:10,073
Your concerns are my concerns.
We have great sex.

879
00:58:10,200 --> 00:58:12,156
You... But you're 17 7 years old.

880
00:58:12,320 --> 00:58:15,869
By the time you're 217,
you'll have a dozen relationships,

881
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:18,639
believe me,
far more passionate than this one.

882
00:58:18,760 --> 00:58:20,990
Well, don't you love me?

883
00:58:23,840 --> 00:58:26,434
The truth is that I love somebody else.

884
00:58:29,720 --> 00:58:31,676
You do?

885
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:35,230
Hey, come on... We... we...

886
00:58:35,360 --> 00:58:38,830
This was supposed to be
a temporary fling. You know that.

887
00:58:39,560 --> 00:58:41,676
You met someone?

888
00:58:41,800 --> 00:58:44,268
Don't stare at me with those big eyes.

889
00:58:44,400 --> 00:58:49,155
You look like one of those barefoot kids
from Bolivia who needs foster parents.

890
00:58:49,280 --> 00:58:51,236
Have you been seeing someone?

891
00:58:51,360 --> 00:58:53,749
No. Yes. Someone older.

892
00:58:53,880 --> 00:58:55,996
I mean, y-y-you know, y-y-you know.

893
00:58:56,120 --> 00:58:59,795
Not as old as I am,
but in the same general ballpark as me.

894
00:59:01,440 --> 00:59:03,396
Gee, now I don't feel so good.

895
00:59:04,200 --> 00:59:07,556
It's not right. You shouldn't get hung...

896
00:59:07,680 --> 00:59:09,796
I mean, you should open up your life.

897
00:59:09,920 --> 00:59:11,876
You know, you've got to.

898
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:16,391
You state it like it's to my advantage,
when it's you that wants to get out of it.

899
00:59:16,520 --> 00:59:19,637
Hey, don't be so precocious, OK?
I mean, don't be so smart.

900
00:59:19,760 --> 00:59:23,878
I'm 42. My hair's falling out. I'm starting
to lose some hearing in my right ear.

901
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:25,558
Is that what you want?

902
00:59:25,680 --> 00:59:29,832
I can't believe that you met somebody
that you like better than me.

903
00:59:31,960 --> 00:59:34,428
Why should I feel guilty about this?

904
00:59:34,560 --> 00:59:38,075
I've always encouraged you
to g<i>o o</i>ut with guys more your own age.

905
00:59:38,200 --> 00:59:42,398
Kids from your class.
Billy and Biff and Scooter.

906
00:59:42,520 --> 00:59:46,149
And, you know, little Tommy or Terry.

907
00:59:46,280 --> 00:59:48,635
Hey, come on, don't cry.

908
00:59:50,880 --> 00:59:52,836
Don't cry.

909
00:59:52,960 --> 00:59:54,757
Come on, don't cry.

910
00:59:54,880 --> 00:59:59,032
Tracy... Tracy, don't...
Come on. Don't cry, Tracy.

911
00:59:59,800 --> 01:00:02,758
- Tracy...
- Just leave me alone.

912
01:00:06,080 --> 01:00:07,832
Tracy, come on, don't...

913
01:00:07,960 --> 01:00:09,916
Leave me alone.

914
01:01:05,040 --> 01:01:07,600
- That was wonderful.
- I'll say.

915
01:01:07,720 --> 01:01:10,951
- I love being in the country.
- It's very relaxing.

916
01:01:11,080 --> 01:01:15,676
The mosquitoes have sucked all the blood
out of my left leg. Apart from that...

917
01:01:15,800 --> 01:01:19,156
- Doesn't it make you feel better?
- Yeah, you were dynamite,

918
01:01:19,280 --> 01:01:22,192
except I felt for about
two seconds you were faking.

919
01:01:22,320 --> 01:01:23,878
- Not a lot.
- No.

920
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:27,436
Yes. When you dug your nails
into my neck, you were a little...

921
01:01:27,560 --> 01:01:29,790
Well, I guess I'm nervous around you.

922
01:01:29,920 --> 01:01:32,275
- Still?
- Well, yeah.

923
01:01:32,400 --> 01:01:35,358
- So crazy.
- Because I'd like everything to work out.

924
01:01:35,480 --> 01:01:39,268
It will. You should leave everything to me.
I'll make everything happen.

925
01:01:39,400 --> 01:01:41,356
D'you really promise?

926
01:01:41,480 --> 01:01:43,869
Because I like you.
I feel good around you.

927
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:45,752
I don't blame you.

928
01:01:45,880 --> 01:01:50,431
Yeah, I mean... Yale was great, he was
absolutely great, but he was married.

929
01:01:50,560 --> 01:01:52,676
And Jeremiah, my ex-husband.

930
01:01:52,800 --> 01:01:55,758
He was just this oversexed,
brilliant kind of animal.

931
01:01:55,880 --> 01:01:59,429
- Hey, what am I? Grandma Moses?
- Not at all. No, no, no.

932
01:01:59,560 --> 01:02:02,199
- You're much different.
- Yeah?

933
01:02:02,320 --> 01:02:05,676
Yes. You're someone
I could imagine having children with.

934
01:02:05,800 --> 01:02:06,949
- Really?
- Yeah.

935
01:02:07,080 --> 01:02:09,275
Hit the lights. Go ahead. Turn 'em out.

936
01:02:09,400 --> 01:02:11,356
We'll trade fours.

937
01:03:09,640 --> 01:03:11,756
Well, we never see you any more.

938
01:03:11,880 --> 01:03:14,235
Cos I'm working on my book.
I'm submerged.

939
01:03:14,360 --> 01:03:17,750
- It's that girl. Serious, isn't it?
- Well, serious, you know.

940
01:03:17,880 --> 01:03:21,475
When are we gonna get to meet her?
I'm sure Yale'd like to meet her.

941
01:03:21,600 --> 01:03:23,397
We should g<i>o o</i>ut sometime.

942
01:03:23,520 --> 01:03:26,751
I don't understand. Why does he
need a car? A sudden urge.

943
01:03:26,880 --> 01:03:28,632
He just wants it.

944
01:03:28,760 --> 01:03:32,673
What...? Is there nothing I can do
to dissuade you from this?

945
01:03:32,800 --> 01:03:37,635
It's so crazy. They should ban all cars
from Manhattan. I mean, this is crazy.

946
01:03:37,760 --> 01:03:41,309
Listen, Emily wants to know
why I never bring Mary around.

947
01:03:41,440 --> 01:03:43,396
Why not bring Mary around?

948
01:03:43,520 --> 01:03:46,478
- I don't know. Is it awkward for you?
- Are you kidding?

949
01:03:46,600 --> 01:03:49,114
I spoke to her. It's no problem for her.

950
01:03:49,240 --> 01:03:50,992
- Then why not?
- Well, you know.

951
01:03:51,120 --> 01:03:54,999
Hey, don't get this thing. I hate cars.
It screws up the environment.

952
01:03:55,120 --> 01:03:57,076
- This is a work of art.
- Yeah.

953
01:03:57,200 --> 01:03:58,758
- Hi.
- Hi.

954
01:03:58,880 --> 01:04:02,793
- This is Emily.
- Hello. Nice to meet you.

955
01:04:02,920 --> 01:04:04,876
- This is Yale.
- Hi, Yale.

956
01:04:05,760 --> 01:04:07,512
So, shall we go?

957
01:04:09,240 --> 01:04:11,196
- Yeah, let's go.
- Sure.

958
01:04:54,280 --> 01:04:57,272
Look at that.
That building is almost torn down.

959
01:04:57,400 --> 01:04:59,914
Can't they have those things
declared landmarks?

960
01:05:00,040 --> 01:05:02,110
Yeah, I once tried to block demolition.

961
01:05:02,240 --> 01:05:06,358
Getting some people to lay in front of a
building, and a cop stepped on my hand.

962
01:05:06,480 --> 01:05:08,755
The city's really changing.

963
01:05:09,720 --> 01:05:13,872
I need something for round the house
that doesn't make me look too Mexican.

964
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:15,353
Ugh, this is...

965
01:05:15,480 --> 01:05:18,597
- Mary?
- Oh, my God. Jeremiah. Well...

966
01:05:18,720 --> 01:05:19,675
Hi.

967
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:24,879
- Jeremiah, this is my friend Isaac Davis.
- Hi. Glad to meet you.

968
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:27,355
- God, this is incredible.
- Incredible.

969
01:05:27,480 --> 01:05:30,756
I'm in town for a few days.
There's a symposium on semantics.

970
01:05:30,880 --> 01:05:34,031
- Well...
- And you're looking so great. I just, uh...

971
01:05:34,160 --> 01:05:38,438
- You. You're so thin. You lost weight.
- Well, I have an exercise machine.

972
01:05:38,560 --> 01:05:41,028
Well, you really look good. Really good.

973
01:05:41,160 --> 01:05:45,711
God. Well, I'm a bit late,
but it's just so nice seeing you.

974
01:05:45,840 --> 01:05:48,752
- It's great seeing you.
- I read an article by you

975
01:05:48,880 --> 01:05:50,836
- On Brecht.
- Oh, shit! I know.

976
01:05:50,960 --> 01:05:53,793
I always was a sucker
for Germanic theatre.

977
01:05:53,920 --> 01:05:55,876
- Well...
- God.

978
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:59,788
- OK. Well, God... OK. So long.
- Bye. Bye, Jeremiah.

979
01:05:59,920 --> 01:06:01,876
Bye. Bye.

980
01:06:03,240 --> 01:06:06,357
God, what a surprise.
I cannot get over it. My ex-husband.

981
01:06:06,480 --> 01:06:09,597
And he really does look a lot thinner.
He looks great.

982
01:06:09,720 --> 01:06:13,679
You certainly fooled me. I was shocked
cos that's not what I expected.

983
01:06:13,800 --> 01:06:18,112
- What did you expect?
- I don't know. You had always led me to...

984
01:06:18,240 --> 01:06:21,596
You said he was a ladies' man,
that he opened you up sexually.

985
01:06:21,720 --> 01:06:25,872
- So? So?
- Then this little homunculus, you know...

986
01:06:26,440 --> 01:06:28,908
He's quite devastating.

987
01:06:29,040 --> 01:06:30,598
Really?

988
01:06:30,720 --> 01:06:34,156
Well, it's... it's amazing
how subjective all that stuff is.

989
01:06:34,280 --> 01:06:36,032
I don't know what you're...

990
01:06:38,040 --> 01:06:41,112
- Boy, you're really typing away.
- Yeah, it's a cinch.

991
01:06:41,240 --> 01:06:43,196
You still reviewing Tolstoy?

992
01:06:43,320 --> 01:06:46,630
No, no, I finished that two days ago.
I'm on that novelisation.

993
01:06:46,760 --> 01:06:50,389
What... what do you waste your time
with a novelisation for?

994
01:06:50,520 --> 01:06:53,034
Why? Because it's easy and it pays well.

995
01:06:53,160 --> 01:06:57,597
It's like another contemporary American
phenomenon that's truly moronic.

996
01:06:57,720 --> 01:07:02,475
The novelisations of movies.
You're much too brilliant for that.

997
01:07:02,600 --> 01:07:05,034
You should be doing other stuff.

998
01:07:05,880 --> 01:07:09,668
- Like what?
- Fiction. I've seen your fiction. It's terrific.

999
01:07:09,800 --> 01:07:11,153
Hello?

1000
01:07:11,280 --> 01:07:13,316
Mary, hi. It's Yale.

1001
01:07:13,440 --> 01:07:15,749
I was hoping you'd pick up.

1002
01:07:15,880 --> 01:07:17,916
Listen, could we meet for coffee?

1003
01:07:18,040 --> 01:07:20,235
Well, why? What is it?

1004
01:07:20,360 --> 01:07:24,592
Well, you know, I miss you.
I just thought maybe we could talk.

1005
01:07:24,720 --> 01:07:29,157
No, I don't think that would be possible.
I don't think that would be possible at all.

1006
01:07:29,280 --> 01:07:32,636
I'm sorry, I just, uh...
No, I... I'm sorry. I gotta go.

1007
01:07:37,760 --> 01:07:39,910
- Who was that?
- What?

1008
01:07:40,040 --> 01:07:41,996
Who was that on the phone just now?

1009
01:07:42,120 --> 01:07:45,874
- Uh, dance lessons.
- Dance lessons that was?!

1010
01:07:47,200 --> 01:07:49,395
Yeah. Do we want free dance lessons?

1011
01:07:50,400 --> 01:07:55,554
Right. They give you one free lesson,
then they hook you for $50,000 worth.

1012
01:08:02,600 --> 01:08:05,831
Viking loved my book.
They loved the first four chapters

1013
01:08:05,960 --> 01:08:08,474
and, you know,
they were really complimentary.

1014
01:08:08,600 --> 01:08:11,273
Yale had read them
and thought they showed promise.

1015
01:08:11,400 --> 01:08:14,119
But Yale's family,
s<i>o o</i>f course he's encouraging.

1016
01:08:14,240 --> 01:08:16,390
But Viking will shell out the money.

1017
01:08:16,520 --> 01:08:21,469
Maybe it'll inspire Yale to finish his book.
He's been talking about it long enough.

1018
01:08:21,600 --> 01:08:26,116
Mary read the stuff and she was
laughing out loud. I respect her judgment.

1019
01:08:26,240 --> 01:08:29,835
- Although she's doing a think piece on...
- Hello?

1020
01:08:29,960 --> 01:08:33,270
Hey, where were you? You were
supposed to be home an hour ago.

1021
01:08:33,400 --> 01:08:36,517
- Uh... I bought the car.
- Oh, no. You did?

1022
01:08:36,640 --> 01:08:39,677
I know it's a meaningless extravagance,
but I had to have it.

1023
01:08:39,800 --> 01:08:41,756
- That thing we saw?
- Yeah.

1024
01:08:41,880 --> 01:08:45,270
Did you hear Viking Press loved
the first four chapters of lke's book?

1025
01:08:45,400 --> 01:08:47,356
- Great!
- They were real complimentary.

1026
01:08:47,480 --> 01:08:49,789
Next week I get the car
and we'll celebrate.

1027
01:08:49,920 --> 01:08:51,558
- OK.
- In our new car.

1028
01:09:42,360 --> 01:09:44,510
Jesus, listen to this.

1029
01:09:44,640 --> 01:09:48,474
"Making love to this
deeper, more masterful female

1030
01:09:48,600 --> 01:09:51,512
made me realise
what an empty experience,

1031
01:09:51,640 --> 01:09:54,837
what a bizarre charade
sex with my husband was."

1032
01:09:54,960 --> 01:09:57,838
Please. That is so nauseating. I...

1033
01:09:57,960 --> 01:10:00,918
Is this true? Did you make love
with Jill and a woman?

1034
01:10:01,040 --> 01:10:02,996
She put that in?

1035
01:10:03,120 --> 01:10:06,430
Christ! She wanted to, I think.
I didn't wanna be a bad sport.

1036
01:10:06,560 --> 01:10:09,154
- Did you have a good time?
- No, I didn't.

1037
01:10:09,280 --> 01:10:12,158
Did you hear the one
where he tried to run her lover over?

1038
01:10:12,280 --> 01:10:14,555
- Oh, yeah.
- Whose side are you on?

1039
01:10:14,680 --> 01:10:18,036
I didn't try and run her over.
It was raining. The car lurched.

1040
01:10:18,160 --> 01:10:22,119
Jesus, now everybody in town
is gonna know all these details.

1041
01:10:22,240 --> 01:10:24,515
Everybody... All my friends and...

1042
01:10:24,640 --> 01:10:28,713
Listen. "He was given to
fits of rage, Jewish, liberal paranoia,

1043
01:10:28,840 --> 01:10:31,593
male chauvinism,
self-righteous misanthropy,

1044
01:10:31,720 --> 01:10:33,836
and nihilistic moods of despair."

1045
01:10:33,960 --> 01:10:36,918
"He had complaints about life,
but never solutions."

1046
01:10:37,040 --> 01:10:40,555
"He longed to be an artist,
but balked at the necessary sacrifices."

1047
01:10:40,680 --> 01:10:43,797
"In his most private moments,
he spoke of his fear of death

1048
01:10:43,920 --> 01:10:48,436
which he elevated to tragic heights
when, in fact, it was mere narcissism."

1049
01:10:48,560 --> 01:10:52,030
- I came here to strangle you.
- Nothing I wrote was untrue.

1050
01:10:52,160 --> 01:10:54,310
You make me out to be
Lee Harvey Oswald!

1051
01:10:54,440 --> 01:10:56,192
It's an honest account.

1052
01:10:56,320 --> 01:10:58,834
- That I'm narcissistic?
- You're self-obsessed.

1053
01:10:58,960 --> 01:11:02,839
- Misanthropic and self-righteous?
- I wrote some nice things about you.

1054
01:11:02,960 --> 01:11:04,712
Like what? What?

1055
01:11:04,840 --> 01:11:06,876
You cry when you see
<i>Gone With The Wind. </i>

1056
01:11:07,880 --> 01:11:09,836
What are you laughing about?

1057
01:11:09,960 --> 01:11:13,555
- You let her write that garbage?
- Wait. This is between you two.

1058
01:11:13,680 --> 01:11:16,399
D'you honestly think
that I tried to run you over?

1059
01:11:16,520 --> 01:11:19,671
You just happened to hit the gas
as I walked in front of the car.

1060
01:11:19,800 --> 01:11:22,872
- Did I do it on purpose?
- Well, what would Freud say?

1061
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:26,151
That I really wanted to run her over.
That's why he was a genius.

1062
01:11:26,280 --> 01:11:28,714
Listen, I'm going upstairs.
I got work to do.

1063
01:11:28,840 --> 01:11:31,513
Don't forget that Willie's at ballet class.

1064
01:11:31,640 --> 01:11:33,631
Look, I better warn you.

1065
01:11:33,760 --> 01:11:37,116
I've had some interest in this book
for a movie sale.

1066
01:11:40,480 --> 01:11:42,277
Anybody home?

1067
01:11:42,400 --> 01:11:47,155
Yeah? I got an unbelievable story
to tell you. Absolutely incredible. You OK?

1068
01:11:47,280 --> 01:11:48,838
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah?

1069
01:11:48,960 --> 01:11:52,350
Just let me get one glass of brown water
cos I'm dying of thirst.

1070
01:11:52,480 --> 01:11:56,519
- Isaac, I wanna talk to you first.
- Mm-mm. So I g<i>o o</i>ver to Jill's today

1071
01:11:56,640 --> 01:12:00,519
because I'm real annoyed over that junk
she printed in the book. And...

1072
01:12:00,640 --> 01:12:04,394
Isaac, before you get wound up,
there's something I wanna tell you.

1073
01:12:04,520 --> 01:12:07,557
- What's the matter? You look pale.
- Well...

1074
01:12:10,120 --> 01:12:12,270
Wh... What's the matter?

1075
01:12:13,680 --> 01:12:16,752
Hey, what... Is there something wrong?
What is it?

1076
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:24,355
I think I'm still in love with Yale.

1077
01:12:30,600 --> 01:12:32,556
What?

1078
01:12:33,680 --> 01:12:35,830
You... Are you kidd...?

1079
01:12:37,800 --> 01:12:40,360
- You are?
- Yes.

1080
01:12:41,440 --> 01:12:44,000
Well, when did this happen? What...

1081
01:12:45,120 --> 01:12:47,315
Well, you are or you <i>think</i> you are?

1082
01:12:47,440 --> 01:12:49,829
I started seeing him again.

1083
01:12:49,960 --> 01:12:51,916
When? Since when?

1084
01:12:53,480 --> 01:12:57,439
Just since today. I mean,
that's why I wanted to be open about it.

1085
01:12:59,080 --> 01:13:01,992
Jesus, I'm... I'm shocked.

1086
01:13:02,120 --> 01:13:06,557
I'm... I'm shocked. I'm surprised.

1087
01:13:06,680 --> 01:13:09,877
I think I've always been in love with him.

1088
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:12,036
How does he feel about this?

1089
01:13:12,160 --> 01:13:13,912
Well...

1090
01:13:14,920 --> 01:13:18,390
He wants to move out of his place
so that we can live together.

1091
01:13:18,520 --> 01:13:21,990
I'm stunned. I mean, I'm in a state of...

1092
01:13:22,120 --> 01:13:25,237
Somebody should
throw a blanket over me. You know, I'm...

1093
01:13:25,360 --> 01:13:29,114
Well, you see, he called me several times
in a very depressed state

1094
01:13:29,240 --> 01:13:31,390
and he still loves me.

1095
01:13:31,520 --> 01:13:35,957
This is shaping up like a Noel Coward
play. Somebody should go make martinis.

1096
01:13:36,080 --> 01:13:38,435
I don't blame you
for being furious with me.

1097
01:13:38,560 --> 01:13:40,516
I'm too stunned to be furious.

1098
01:13:40,640 --> 01:13:44,952
Well, then I wish you would. I wish you'd
get angry so that we could have it out.

1099
01:13:45,080 --> 01:13:47,435
I don't get angry. I tend to internalise.

1100
01:13:47,560 --> 01:13:51,758
I can't express anger. That's one of the
problems I have. I grow a tumour instead.

1101
01:13:51,880 --> 01:13:56,715
Well, I told you that I was trouble from the
beginning, from when we started dating.

1102
01:13:56,840 --> 01:13:59,035
So what does your analyst say?

1103
01:13:59,160 --> 01:14:02,277
Donny's in a coma.
He had a very bad acid experience.

1104
01:14:02,400 --> 01:14:05,790
Oh, that's gr... That's great.
I mean, you know...

1105
01:14:05,920 --> 01:14:09,071
- I think you're making a big mistake here.
- Why?

1106
01:14:09,200 --> 01:14:12,431
Why? Because you... Why?
Because you're preferring Yale to me.

1107
01:14:12,560 --> 01:14:15,836
I know that sounds egotistical,
but... you know...

1108
01:14:15,960 --> 01:14:19,430
This guy's been married 17 2 years.
What do you think will happen?

1109
01:14:19,560 --> 01:14:22,393
He'll be away from her for a month,
he'll go crazy.

1110
01:14:22,520 --> 01:14:26,354
And if he does commit to you, when
you start to feel secure, you'll drop him.

1111
01:14:26,480 --> 01:14:29,233
I know it.
I give the whole thing... four weeks.

1112
01:14:29,360 --> 01:14:31,920
I can't plan that far in advance.

1113
01:14:32,040 --> 01:14:35,157
- You can't plan four weeks in advance?!
- No!

1114
01:14:35,280 --> 01:14:37,794
What kind of foresight is that?

1115
01:14:37,920 --> 01:14:41,799
Jesus. You know, I knew you were crazy
when we started going out.

1116
01:14:41,920 --> 01:14:46,755
You always think that you're gonna be
the one that makes 'em act different, but...

1117
01:14:46,880 --> 01:14:49,394
Isaac, I'm sorry.
I really am. I'm really sorry.

1118
01:14:49,520 --> 01:14:51,670
Oh, well, I'm...

1119
01:14:51,800 --> 01:14:54,439
I'm sorr... Where are you going?

1120
01:14:54,560 --> 01:14:56,516
- I gotta get some air.
- Oh.

1121
01:15:33,400 --> 01:15:34,958
What are you doing here?

1122
01:15:35,080 --> 01:15:37,230
I spoke to Mary. Were you gonna tell me?

1123
01:15:37,360 --> 01:15:41,319
- I was, but... I'm trying to teach a class.
- So where can we go and talk?

1124
01:15:41,440 --> 01:15:44,398
- How'd you get past the security?
- I walked right past.

1125
01:15:44,520 --> 01:15:47,592
What are you telling me?
That you're gonna leave Emily

1126
01:15:47,720 --> 01:15:50,314
and run away with
the... the winner of the

1127
01:15:50,440 --> 01:15:53,000
Zelda Fitzgerald
Emotional Maturity Award?

1128
01:15:53,120 --> 01:15:54,872
Look, I love her.

1129
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:58,788
- What kind of crazy friend are you?
- A good friend. I introduced you two.

1130
01:15:58,920 --> 01:16:01,673
- Why? What was the point?
- Cos I thought you liked her!

1131
01:16:01,800 --> 01:16:05,349
- I do! Now we both like her!
- Yeah, well, I liked her first.

1132
01:16:05,480 --> 01:16:10,315
"I liked her first."
What are you, six years old? Jesus!

1133
01:16:10,440 --> 01:16:14,592
Look, would I have encouraged you
to take her out if I still liked her?

1134
01:16:14,720 --> 01:16:16,870
So you liked her? Now you don't like her?

1135
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:20,310
It's early. You can change your mind
one more time before dinner.

1136
01:16:20,440 --> 01:16:23,193
Don't get sarcastic about this.
You think I like this?

1137
01:16:23,320 --> 01:16:26,073
How long were you gonna see her
without telling me?

1138
01:16:26,200 --> 01:16:29,670
Don't turn this into
one of your big moral issues.

1139
01:16:29,800 --> 01:16:33,679
You could've said, but you... All you had
to do was call me and talk to me.

1140
01:16:33,800 --> 01:16:37,349
I'm understanding. I'd have said no,
but you'd have felt honest.

1141
01:16:37,480 --> 01:16:40,950
I wanted to tell you about it.
I knew it would upset you. I...

1142
01:16:41,080 --> 01:16:43,230
We had a few innocent meetings.

1143
01:16:43,360 --> 01:16:48,115
A few? She said one. You guys should get
your story straight. Don't you rehearse?

1144
01:16:48,240 --> 01:16:50,276
We met twice for coffee.

1145
01:16:50,400 --> 01:16:52,356
Hey, she doesn't drink coffee.

1146
01:16:52,480 --> 01:16:56,598
Did you meet for Sanka? That's not too
romantic. A little on the geriatric side.

1147
01:16:56,720 --> 01:16:58,278
I'm not a saint, OK?

1148
01:16:58,400 --> 01:17:00,960
You're too easy on yourself.
Don't you see?

1149
01:17:01,080 --> 01:17:05,437
You're... You rationalise everything.
You're not honest with yourself.

1150
01:17:05,560 --> 01:17:09,872
You talk about you wanna write a book,
but in the end you'd rather buy a Porsche.

1151
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:14,198
You cheat a little bit on Emily
and you play around the truth with me.

1152
01:17:14,320 --> 01:17:18,472
The next thing you know you're in front
of a Senate committee naming names.

1153
01:17:18,600 --> 01:17:20,352
You are so self-righteous.

1154
01:17:20,480 --> 01:17:24,473
I mean, we're just people. We're just
human beings. You think you're God!

1155
01:17:24,600 --> 01:17:27,672
I gotta model myself after someone.

1156
01:17:27,800 --> 01:17:30,997
You just can't live the way you do.
It's all so perfect.

1157
01:17:31,120 --> 01:17:34,430
Jesus, what are future generations
gonna say about us? My God!

1158
01:17:34,560 --> 01:17:37,120
You know, someday
we're gonna be like him.

1159
01:17:37,240 --> 01:17:41,677
And he was probably one of the beautiful
people, dancing and playing tennis.

1160
01:17:41,800 --> 01:17:44,189
And now look. This is what happens to us.

1161
01:17:44,320 --> 01:17:47,869
You know, it's important
to have some kind of personal integrity.

1162
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:50,389
I'll be hanging in a classroom one day

1163
01:17:50,520 --> 01:17:55,116
and I wanna make sure when I thin out
that I'm... well thought of.

1164
01:17:55,240 --> 01:17:56,593
Ike!

1165
01:17:56,720 --> 01:17:58,756
Isaac, where are you going?

1166
01:18:50,040 --> 01:18:52,600
No, I knew Yale had affairs.

1167
01:18:53,520 --> 01:18:55,556
But then, nothing's perfect.

1168
01:18:55,680 --> 01:19:00,231
Marriage is a... requires
some minor compromises, I guess.

1169
01:19:00,360 --> 01:19:03,318
It's funny cos I'm just a non-compromiser.

1170
01:19:03,440 --> 01:19:06,193
I mean, I can't... I can't see that.

1171
01:19:06,320 --> 01:19:11,678
I think it's always a mistake to look the
other way cos you pay for it in the end.

1172
01:19:11,800 --> 01:19:14,997
But then you saw what Jill
wrote about me in that book.

1173
01:19:15,120 --> 01:19:17,076
I'm living in the past.

1174
01:19:17,200 --> 01:19:19,236
How about you? You seeing anybody?

1175
01:19:19,360 --> 01:19:23,990
Yeah. You know, I... I never had any
problem meeting women. I mean, that's...

1176
01:19:24,120 --> 01:19:27,078
But I was thinking about this
just about a week ago.

1177
01:19:27,200 --> 01:19:31,751
I think, and I know this sounds strange,
but I think I really missed a good bet

1178
01:19:31,880 --> 01:19:33,836
when I let Tracy go.

1179
01:19:33,960 --> 01:19:36,110
- Remember Tracy?
- Yeah. I liked her.

1180
01:19:36,240 --> 01:19:39,118
Yeah. I was thinking about this
at home last week

1181
01:19:39,240 --> 01:19:42,835
and I think, of all the women
I've known over the last years,

1182
01:19:42,960 --> 01:19:47,556
when I actually am honest with myself,
I think I had the most relaxed times

1183
01:19:47,680 --> 01:19:50,319
and, you know, the nicest times with her.

1184
01:19:50,440 --> 01:19:52,635
She was a terrific kid, but young, right?

1185
01:19:52,800 --> 01:19:54,756
So that's that.

1186
01:19:54,880 --> 01:19:56,836
Why don't you call her?

1187
01:19:56,960 --> 01:19:59,758
No, I would never do that.
I think I blew that one.

1188
01:19:59,880 --> 01:20:03,156
I kept her at a distance
and I would never give her a chance.

1189
01:20:03,280 --> 01:20:07,034
And she was so sweet, you know.

1190
01:20:07,160 --> 01:20:10,948
She called me. She left a message
with my service about a month ago

1191
01:20:11,080 --> 01:20:16,712
that I should watch <i>Grand Illusion</i>
on television and I never returned her call.

1192
01:20:16,840 --> 01:20:19,798
Cos l, you know, I didn't wanna
lead her on or anything.

1193
01:20:19,920 --> 01:20:22,070
She really cared about me and I...

1194
01:20:23,400 --> 01:20:25,595
You know I was a little pissed off at you.

1195
01:20:25,720 --> 01:20:27,073
Me?

1196
01:20:27,200 --> 01:20:31,796
I figured if you hadn't introduced Mary
to Yale, this might never have happened.

1197
01:20:35,160 --> 01:20:39,915
An idea for a short story
about, um, people in Manhattan

1198
01:20:40,040 --> 01:20:42,600
who are constantly creating

1199
01:20:42,720 --> 01:20:47,077
these real, unnecessary,
neurotic problems for themselves

1200
01:20:47,200 --> 01:20:52,877
cos it keeps them from dealing with
more unsolvable, terrifying problems

1201
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:55,275
about... the universe.

1202
01:20:57,680 --> 01:20:59,955
Let's...
Well, it has to be optimistic.

1203
01:21:00,080 --> 01:21:03,789
Well, all right, why is life worth living?
That's a very good question.

1204
01:21:06,320 --> 01:21:10,472
Well, there are certain things, I guess,
that make it worthwhile.

1205
01:21:11,960 --> 01:21:13,313
Like what?

1206
01:21:13,880 --> 01:21:18,476
OK... for me...

1207
01:21:19,360 --> 01:21:24,718
Ooh, I would say Groucho Marx,
to name one thing.

1208
01:21:26,480 --> 01:21:28,471
And Willie Mays.

1209
01:21:28,600 --> 01:21:33,958
And... the second movement
of the Jupiter Symphony.

1210
01:21:34,640 --> 01:21:40,192
And... Louis Armstrong's
recording of <i>Potato Head Blues. </i>

1211
01:21:42,280 --> 01:21:43,998
Swedish movies, naturally.

1212
01:21:44,120 --> 01:21:46,918
<i>Sentimental Education</i> by Flaubert.

1213
01:21:47,920 --> 01:21:49,990
Marlon Brando, Frank Sinatra.

1214
01:21:51,560 --> 01:21:56,839
Those incredible
apples and pears by C?anne.

1215
01:21:58,440 --> 01:22:00,237
The crabs at Sam Wo's.

1216
01:22:02,880 --> 01:22:05,474
Tracy's face.

1217
01:25:38,920 --> 01:25:39,955
Hi.

1218
01:25:40,160 --> 01:25:41,912
Hi.

1219
01:25:42,880 --> 01:25:44,438
I...

1220
01:25:44,560 --> 01:25:46,516
What are you doing here?

1221
01:25:46,680 --> 01:25:49,240
Well, I ran.

1222
01:25:49,960 --> 01:25:53,157
I tried to call you on the phone,
but... it was busy

1223
01:25:53,280 --> 01:25:56,511
so I knew that was two hours' worth of...

1224
01:25:56,640 --> 01:25:58,995
So I couldn't get a taxi cab, so I ran.

1225
01:26:02,520 --> 01:26:04,476
Where you going?

1226
01:26:04,600 --> 01:26:06,352
London.

1227
01:26:07,040 --> 01:26:08,996
You're going to London now?

1228
01:26:09,120 --> 01:26:13,432
What d'you... What d'you mean? If I got
over here two minutes later, you'd be...

1229
01:26:13,560 --> 01:26:15,516
...you'd be going to London?

1230
01:26:20,600 --> 01:26:23,478
Well, let me get right to the point then.

1231
01:26:23,600 --> 01:26:25,352
I don't think you oughta go.

1232
01:26:25,480 --> 01:26:29,189
I think I made a big mistake.
and I would prefer it if you didn't go.

1233
01:26:29,320 --> 01:26:31,276
Oh, Isaac.

1234
01:26:31,400 --> 01:26:35,632
I mean it. I know it looks real bad now,
but, uh, you know, it...

1235
01:26:35,760 --> 01:26:38,558
Are you seeing anybody?
Are you going with anybody?

1236
01:26:38,680 --> 01:26:40,033
No.

1237
01:26:41,120 --> 01:26:43,076
So... well...

1238
01:26:43,200 --> 01:26:46,954
D'you still love me,
or has that worn off or what?

1239
01:26:48,640 --> 01:26:50,596
Jesus, you... pop up...

1240
01:26:51,520 --> 01:26:54,432
You don't call me
and then you suddenly appear.

1241
01:26:55,040 --> 01:26:58,555
I mean... What happened
to that woman you met?

1242
01:26:58,680 --> 01:27:02,229
Well, I'll tell you,
I don't see her any more.

1243
01:27:02,360 --> 01:27:05,909
I made a mistake.
What d'you want me to say?

1244
01:27:06,920 --> 01:27:09,275
I don't think you oughta go to London.

1245
01:27:11,880 --> 01:27:13,996
Well, I have to go.

1246
01:27:14,120 --> 01:27:16,839
I mean, all the plans have been made,
arrangements.

1247
01:27:16,960 --> 01:27:21,238
I mean, my parents are there now
looking for a place for me to live.

1248
01:27:23,120 --> 01:27:25,076
Well...

1249
01:27:25,200 --> 01:27:27,953
Do you still love me or what?

1250
01:27:29,400 --> 01:27:31,356
Do you love me?

1251
01:27:31,880 --> 01:27:34,235
Well, yeah, that's what... Of course.

1252
01:27:34,360 --> 01:27:36,920
That's what this is all about, you know.

1253
01:27:37,040 --> 01:27:39,713
- Guess what? I turned 178 the other day.
- Did you?

1254
01:27:39,840 --> 01:27:41,956
I'm legal, but I'm still a kid.

1255
01:27:42,080 --> 01:27:44,958
You're not such a kid. 178 years old.

1256
01:27:45,120 --> 01:27:48,271
They could draft you.
In some countries you'd be...

1257
01:27:50,880 --> 01:27:54,031
- You look good.
- You really hurt me.

1258
01:27:54,160 --> 01:27:56,151
It was not on purpose, you know.

1259
01:27:56,280 --> 01:27:59,431
I mean, I...
You know, it was... I mean...

1260
01:28:00,280 --> 01:28:03,113
It was just the way
I was looking at things then.

1261
01:28:03,240 --> 01:28:05,674
Well, I'll be back in six months.

1262
01:28:05,800 --> 01:28:08,155
Six months! Are you kidding?

1263
01:28:08,840 --> 01:28:10,990
Six months you're gonna go for?

1264
01:28:12,160 --> 01:28:17,359
We've gone this long. I mean, what's
six months if we still love each other?

1265
01:28:17,480 --> 01:28:19,436
Hey, don't be so mature, OK?

1266
01:28:19,560 --> 01:28:22,120
I mean, six months is a long time.
Six months!

1267
01:28:22,240 --> 01:28:27,712
You're gonna be in the thea... working
in the theatre with actors and directors.

1268
01:28:27,840 --> 01:28:31,515
You know, you go to rehearsal
and you hang out with those people.

1269
01:28:31,640 --> 01:28:36,998
You have lunch a lot and before you know
it attachments form and... you know...

1270
01:28:37,120 --> 01:28:40,669
I mean, you don't wanna get into that...
You'll change.

1271
01:28:40,800 --> 01:28:43,758
In six months you'll be
a completely different person.

1272
01:28:43,880 --> 01:28:46,997
Well, don't you want me
to have that experience?

1273
01:28:47,120 --> 01:28:50,192
I mean, a while ago
you made such a convincing case.

1274
01:28:52,200 --> 01:28:55,351
Yeah, of course I do, but, you know...

1275
01:28:55,480 --> 01:28:59,632
I mean, I just don't want that thing
about you that I like to change.

1276
01:29:03,880 --> 01:29:05,950
I've gotta make a plane.

1277
01:29:06,080 --> 01:29:08,913
Come on, you don't... Come on.

1278
01:29:09,040 --> 01:29:11,315
You don't... You don't have to go.

1279
01:29:12,320 --> 01:29:15,471
Why couldn't you have
brought this up last week?

1280
01:29:18,080 --> 01:29:20,355
Six months isn't so long.

1281
01:29:22,080 --> 01:29:24,435
Not everybody gets corrupted.

1282
01:29:26,480 --> 01:29:29,790
You have to have a little faith in people.
