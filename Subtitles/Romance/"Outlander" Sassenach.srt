Why, exactly, I'm not sure,

181
00:10:55,693 --> 00:10:58,962

A brigadier once dressed
me down because I drew it

Up on top there, that's Cocknammon rock.

198

And in the 17th and 18th centuries,

199
00:12:32,824 --> 00:12:35,625
you would have often found
British army patrol up there

lying in wait for Scottish
rebels and brigands.

201

Can you see how it commands the
high ground in every direction?

202
00:12:42,533 --> 00:12:45,469
It was a perfect position for an ambush.

So what I can gather,

222
00:13:55,106 --> 00:13:57,507
Castle Leoch was the ancestral home

223
00:13:57,575 --> 00:13:59,110
of the laird of the MacKenzie clan

224
00:13:59,177 --> 00:14:00,978

I have no evidence that my

operational sphere, so...

It's just possible

240
00:15:02,673 --> 00:15:04,474

314
00:19:56,934 --> 00:19:59,403
It's best for the readings, though.

315
00:19:59,470 --> 00:20:02,005
Oh, I had a terrible
time with that Earl grey.

316

326
00:20:38,643 --> 00:20:40,944
Or could not.

327
00:20:43,514 --> 00:20:45,949
Everything in it's contradictory.

328
00:20:46,017 --> 00:20:49,553
There's a curved leaf,
which indicates a journey,

329
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:52,122
but it's crossed by a broken one,

330
00:20:52,190 --> 00:20:54,891
- which means staying put.
- Hmm.

331
00:20:56,627 --> 00:20:59,896
And there are strangers there,
to be sure. Several of them.

332
00:20:59,964 --> 00:21:03,967
And one of them's your husband,
if I read the leaves aright.

333
00:21:05,703 --> 00:21:07,204
Show me your hand, Dear.

334
00:21:13,678 --> 00:21:14,811
Odd.

335
00:21:14,879 --> 00:21:17,514
Most hands have a likeness to them.

336
00:21:17,582 --> 00:21:19,149
There are patterns, you know?

337
00:21:19,217 --> 00:21:21,418
But...

338
00:21:21,486 --> 00:21:24,121
This is a pattern I've not seen before.

339
00:21:26,958 --> 00:21:28,658
Oh.

340
00:21:28,726 --> 00:21:32,696
The large thumb, now, means
that you're strong-minded

341
00:21:32,764 --> 00:21:35,999
and you've a will not easily crossed.

342
00:21:36,067 --> 00:21:40,604
And this is your mount of Venus.

343
00:21:40,671 --> 00:21:43,106
In a man, it means he likes the Lasses.

344
00:21:43,174 --> 00:21:45,675
But it is a bit different for a woman.

345
00:21:45,743 --> 00:21:47,511
To be polite about it,

346
00:21:47,578 --> 00:21:50,680

to stray far from your bed.

all bits and pieces.

350
00:22:04,562 --> 00:22:06,530
The marriage line's divided.

351
00:22:06,598 --> 00:22:08,365
Means two marriages.

352
00:22:08,733 --> 00:22:11,902
But...

353
00:22:11,969 --> 00:22:14,938
Most divided lines are broken.

354
00:22:17,675 --> 00:22:20,343
Yours is...

355
00:22:21,579 --> 00:22:23,180
Forked.

356
00:22:26,484 --> 00:22:30,454
I suspect your ancestor had a patron.

357
