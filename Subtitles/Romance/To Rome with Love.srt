00:18:01,664 --> 00:18:03,666
She's studying here.

343
00:18:05,543 --> 00:18:06,795
Hey, Sally.
- Hi.

344
00:18:06,877 --> 00:18:09,050
- Hey. I brought someone home
who used to live here.

345
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:10,803
- Oh, my gosh.
Yeah. This is John Foy.

346
00:18:10,881 --> 00:18:12,098
This is Sally.
- Wow.

347
00:18:12,174 --> 00:18:13,175
- Hello.
- Hi. It's Sally.

348
00:18:13,259 --> 00:18:14,852
That's so wild.
- Yeah, I know.

349
00:18:14,927 --> 00:18:16,770
- You were right. She's lovely.
- Yeah, she's the best.

350
00:18:16,846 --> 00:18:18,940
- Well... Oh, can I
get you something to drink?

351
00:18:19,015 --> 00:18:20,483
I could make some coffee.
- That would be great, honey.

352
00:18:20,558 --> 00:18:21,480
Yeah, thank you very much.
- Thank you.

353
00:18:21,559 --> 00:18:23,061
- Oh. Oh, my gosh!

354
00:18:23,144 --> 00:18:25,488
My friend, Monica, she called.

355
00:18:25,563 --> 00:18:26,610
She's going to be in Rome,

356
00:18:26,689 --> 00:18:28,532
and I told her
she could stay with us.

357
00:18:28,608 --> 00:18:30,986
- Ah. Well, so I'll finally
get to meet her.

358
00:18:31,068 --> 00:18:32,945
- She just broke up
with her boyfriend,

359
00:18:33,029 --> 00:18:34,747
so she's a bit at loose ends.

360
00:18:34,822 --> 00:18:36,870
- Trouble.
Trouble in River City.

361
00:18:36,949 --> 00:18:38,292
- What, trouble?
Why trouble?

362
00:18:38,367 --> 00:18:39,789
- You're just going
to love her.

363
00:18:39,869 --> 00:18:42,588
She's smart and funny

364
00:18:43,289 --> 00:18:45,587
and interesting.

365
00:18:45,666 --> 00:18:47,464
Men just adore her.

366
00:18:47,543 --> 00:18:49,090
I think it's because
of the sexual vibe

367
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:50,797
that she gives off.
Mmm-hmm.

368
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,348
- And how long
is she coming for?

369
00:18:52,423 --> 00:18:53,640
- Oh, I don't know.

370
00:18:53,716 --> 00:18:54,888
Between the breakup,

371
00:18:54,967 --> 00:18:57,720
and then her acting career
isn't going that well...

372
00:18:57,803 --> 00:18:58,804
- Jesus Christ, can't you see

373
00:18:58,888 --> 00:19:00,765
the situation
is fraught with peril?

374
00:19:00,848 --> 00:19:02,521
- What? Give me a break.
Her friend is coming.

375
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:03,647
What do I care?
I'm not looking for anything.

376
00:19:03,726 --> 00:19:06,229
I'm perfectly happy
with Sally, and...

377
00:19:06,312 --> 00:19:07,689
Actually, judging
from Sally's description,

378
00:19:07,772 --> 00:19:10,821
Monica's kind of like a neurotic,
unpredictable type.

379
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:12,994
- Beautiful, funny,
smart, sexual

380
00:19:13,069 --> 00:19:14,241
and also neurotic?

381
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:15,913
It's like filling
an inside straight.

382
00:19:17,365 --> 00:19:18,412
Monica.

383
00:19:19,742 --> 00:19:21,369
Even her name is hot.

384
00:19:46,102 --> 00:19:47,604
(KNOCKING AT DOOR)

385
00:19:52,358 --> 00:19:54,031
Congratulations.
(SPEAKING ITALIAN)

386
00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:56,408
- Yes?
- I have your special gift.

387
00:19:56,570 --> 00:19:59,744
- What gift?
- A special gift for a special man.

388
00:20:00,157 --> 00:20:01,750
- What is this special gift?

389
00:20:01,909 --> 00:20:02,876
- I am.

390
00:20:03,077 --> 00:20:05,921
Everything's been paid in full.
I'm yours.

391
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:09,630
- I think there's been a mistake.
- Whatever pleases you.

392
00:20:09,792 --> 00:20:11,794
- That's okay. Please leave.

393
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:14,964
- I can't. They'd be very upset.
- Who?

394
00:20:15,256 --> 00:20:19,102
- They said you were high-strung
and would be quite surprised.

395
00:20:19,427 --> 00:20:22,601
But you're the lucky winner.
- What winner?

396
00:20:22,763 --> 00:20:25,516
- The winner of the bet.
- What bet?

397
00:20:25,683 --> 00:20:30,154
- Tommy and Fabio. They paid me
and said to say, congratulations.

398
00:20:32,982 --> 00:20:35,781
- I don't know who they are.
Please leave, miss.

399
00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:38,203
- I am told to ask no questions.

400
00:20:38,571 --> 00:20:40,949
I am hereto fulfill your dreams.

401
00:20:41,115 --> 00:20:44,460
- What are you doing?
Please, miss. You must leave.

402
00:20:44,827 --> 00:20:47,706
- You are Mr. DeBroca, room 504?

403
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,924
- You have the right room
but the wrong person.

404
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:52,300
And now you must leave.

405
00:20:52,543 --> 00:20:54,170
- Anybody here?

406
00:20:54,962 --> 00:20:55,929
(GASPS)

407
00:20:56,922 --> 00:20:59,892
Excuse us. So sorry.

408
00:21:00,593 --> 00:21:02,311
- I told you we should wait.

409
00:21:03,012 --> 00:21:05,356
- That is not what you think.
Come in.

410
00:21:05,514 --> 00:21:06,686
- Our date was for noon.

411
00:21:07,057 --> 00:21:08,900
The door was open.

412
00:21:09,143 --> 00:21:11,020
- You can't just barge in
without knocking.

413
00:21:11,187 --> 00:21:13,736
- What a way to meet your new bride.

414
00:21:14,398 --> 00:21:15,399
- She's not my bride.

415
00:21:15,649 --> 00:21:16,741
- No?

416
00:21:17,943 --> 00:21:19,945
- You're joking I hope.

417
00:21:21,489 --> 00:21:23,287
- Of course I'm joking.

418
00:21:23,616 --> 00:21:25,368
This is my wife.

419
00:21:26,452 --> 00:21:28,170
- I am his Uncle Paolo.

420
00:21:29,163 --> 00:21:30,881
- Giovanna.

421
00:21:31,373 --> 00:21:33,125
- Uncle Sal.

422
00:21:33,584 --> 00:21:34,585
- Aunt Rita.

423
00:21:36,295 --> 00:21:37,296
- Anna.

424
00:21:38,047 --> 00:21:39,048
- Anna?

425
00:21:39,173 --> 00:21:40,675
Isn't her name Milly?

426
00:21:41,133 --> 00:21:42,385
- Milly? Uh...

427
00:21:43,093 --> 00:21:46,893
Yes. Definitely Milly.
Her middle name is Anna.

428
00:21:47,139 --> 00:21:49,062
- Milly?
- Milly.

429
00:21:50,226 --> 00:21:52,027
- We'll wait downstairs.
Don't worry about us.

430
00:21:52,186 --> 00:21:54,188
Let's go Paolo.

431
00:21:55,815 --> 00:21:57,658
- We'll see you soon.

432
00:22:00,778 --> 00:22:01,950
(CHUCKLES)

433
00:22:02,655 --> 00:22:03,907
- I'm dead.

434
00:22:04,365 --> 00:22:06,083
My life is over. I'm ruined.

435
00:22:06,367 --> 00:22:07,835
- Just tell them the truth.

436
00:22:07,993 --> 00:22:09,370
It was all a mistake.

437
00:22:09,537 --> 00:22:10,663
- How do I do that?

438
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:13,458
They saw us on the bed.
I'm in my underwear.

439
00:22:15,125 --> 00:22:18,629
They won't believe me.
It's useless.

440
00:22:19,046 --> 00:22:22,425
They'll think my wife is out of the hotel
so I hired a call girl.

441
00:22:22,591 --> 00:22:24,389
Why did you grab me like that?

442
00:22:24,552 --> 00:22:27,601
- I was paid to make love to DeBroca.

443
00:22:27,972 --> 00:22:31,727
- And you leave the door open? Idiot!
- I thought I closed it!

444
00:22:31,892 --> 00:22:33,235
They barged in.

445
00:22:33,561 --> 00:22:36,405
These upper class feel entitled.

446
00:22:36,981 --> 00:22:40,281
- Milly will be back any minute.
We have to get out of here now.

447
00:22:40,442 --> 00:22:42,490
You have to pretend to be my wife.

448
00:22:43,028 --> 00:22:46,498
- Pretend to be your wife?
I'm not an actress.

449
00:22:47,157 --> 00:22:48,830
And you just called me an idiot.

450
00:22:48,993 --> 00:22:52,122
- I'm sorry. I apologize.
You must help me. And hurry.

451
00:22:52,288 --> 00:22:55,963
If Milly walks in I will jump
out of the window, I will kill myself.

452
00:22:56,250 --> 00:22:58,924
- Sooner or later they'll find out.

453
00:22:59,712 --> 00:23:03,512
- I need to buy more time, so I can
think of something, some way out.

454
00:23:03,674 --> 00:23:06,518
We need to get out of here now.

455
00:23:07,344 --> 00:23:08,391
SALLY:
Can you walk faster?

456
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:10,347
- I'm walking fine.
Relax.

457
00:23:10,431 --> 00:23:11,899
- Her flight should
have landed.

458
00:23:11,974 --> 00:23:13,692
Relax. By the time she goes through
customs and luggage,

459
00:23:13,809 --> 00:23:14,810
we'll have been
waiting an hour.

460
00:23:14,894 --> 00:23:16,612
- I hope that you don't
fall in love with her.

461
00:23:16,687 --> 00:23:18,607
- In love with her?
What the hell does that mean?

462
00:23:18,647 --> 00:23:21,491
- Well, men always,
they just go crazy for her.

463
00:23:21,567 --> 00:23:23,911
- Well, I'm crazy for you.

464
00:23:23,986 --> 00:23:25,533
Okay, that's her.

465
00:23:25,613 --> 00:23:26,660
Monica!

466
00:23:28,198 --> 00:23:29,120
- Hi!

467
00:23:32,536 --> 00:23:33,753
It's so good to see you.

468
00:23:33,829 --> 00:23:36,002
- You look so great.
- You look so great.

469
00:23:39,084 --> 00:23:40,210
- Nothing special, right?

470
00:23:40,294 --> 00:23:41,466
- No, no, nothing
special at all.

471
00:23:41,545 --> 00:23:43,547
I got no buzz.

472
00:23:43,631 --> 00:23:45,633
I mean, look at her.
This is the hot femme fatale?

473
00:23:45,716 --> 00:23:48,185
- Of course, she has been
flying for 14 hours.

474
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:51,890
But you will admit
there is something about her.

475
00:23:51,972 --> 00:23:53,770
- All I can say is,
if something is clicking,

476
00:23:53,849 --> 00:23:56,068
it's so subconscious,
I'm totally unaware.

477
00:23:56,143 --> 00:23:58,896
She's no big deal. Certainly not some
formidable heartbreaker.

478
00:23:58,979 --> 00:24:01,448
She's a disheveled,
out-of-work actress.

479
00:24:01,523 --> 00:24:03,946
- I've been wanting you to come for so
long, and now you're here. I just...

480
00:24:04,026 --> 00:24:05,494
- Hi. Hi. I'm Jack.

481
00:24:05,569 --> 00:24:06,695
- This is Monica.

482
00:24:06,779 --> 00:24:08,031
- Hi. It's so nice to meet you.
- I'm sorry.

483
00:24:08,113 --> 00:24:09,740
- I mean, I must look awful.

484
00:24:09,823 --> 00:24:11,621
- What do you mean? - I mean, please
don't make any snap judgments.

485
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:13,794
- No, you look fine.
- Like, I grown on people.

486
00:24:13,869 --> 00:24:15,792
I just... I can never
sleep on planes.

487
00:24:15,871 --> 00:24:17,631
I had a scotch
and three Ambien, but still...

488
00:24:18,791 --> 00:24:21,465
- Pretty cozy,
this ride into town.

489
00:24:21,585 --> 00:24:23,963
- I keep telling you, I have no interest
in Monica.

490
00:24:24,046 --> 00:24:25,298
I just hope having her around

491
00:24:25,381 --> 00:24:26,803
is not going to
interfere with my work.

492
00:24:26,882 --> 00:24:28,850
- But there is an element
of excitement...

493
00:24:28,926 --> 00:24:31,975
A germ, a spark, one molecule.

494
00:24:32,054 --> 00:24:33,897
God.

495
00:24:33,973 --> 00:24:36,726
I see it so clearly,
now that I'm older.

496
00:24:38,227 --> 00:24:39,524
Thank you.
Dinner was great.

497
00:24:39,603 --> 00:24:40,695
- Thank you.
JACK: Ah, yeah.

498
00:24:40,771 --> 00:24:42,648
You're becoming
a really great Italian chef.

499
00:24:42,731 --> 00:24:44,904
SALLY: Well, I figured,
it was your first night here,

500
00:24:44,984 --> 00:24:47,112
so, why not stay in?

501
00:24:47,194 --> 00:24:49,288
- No, yeah, it's perfect,
just the three of us.

502
00:24:49,363 --> 00:24:50,580
What are you reading?

503
00:24:50,656 --> 00:24:51,782
- Oh, the poetry of Yeats.

504
00:24:51,865 --> 00:24:52,832
(SIGHS)

505
00:24:52,908 --> 00:24:55,002
- The "gong-tormented sea."

506
00:24:55,077 --> 00:24:56,670
- Yeah, yeah.
You know it?

507
00:24:56,745 --> 00:24:59,168
- Do you want to talk
about the breakup with Donald?

508
00:24:59,248 --> 00:25:01,501
- Well, Donald was gay.

509
00:25:01,583 --> 00:25:04,507
It was my ego
that thought I could change him,

510
00:25:04,586 --> 00:25:07,214
and I couldn't,
and believe me, I tried.

511
00:25:07,297 --> 00:25:09,766
- Oh, yeah?
How does one try?

512
00:25:09,842 --> 00:25:12,721
- Well, I mean,
I don't want to get graphic,

513
00:25:12,803 --> 00:25:17,183
but, I mean, let's just say
that I gave it my all.

514
00:25:17,266 --> 00:25:19,689
And it's such a shame
because he is so brilliant

515
00:25:19,768 --> 00:25:21,441
and he's so wonderful
out of bed.

516
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:23,238
I mean, so much fun to be with.

517
00:25:23,313 --> 00:25:27,363
(STAMMERING) I tried
to show him how sex with a woman

518
00:25:27,443 --> 00:25:30,196
could be as exciting
or even more so

519
00:25:30,279 --> 00:25:32,031
than with someone
from his own sex.

520
00:25:32,114 --> 00:25:33,491
And he tried.

521
00:25:33,574 --> 00:25:35,827
He... He did try.

522
00:25:35,909 --> 00:25:38,753
But, in the end,
I struck out, so...

523
00:25:38,829 --> 00:25:40,706
- I remember you
saying how much fun

524
00:25:40,789 --> 00:25:42,336
you had when he
took you to Paris.

525
00:25:42,416 --> 00:25:43,777
- Have you ever
had sex with a man?

526
00:25:44,168 --> 00:25:45,670
Me, sex with a man?

527
00:25:45,753 --> 00:25:47,346
God, no, no, no.
I mean, no.

528
00:25:47,421 --> 00:25:50,345
It's not something
I'm interested in ever doing.

529
00:25:50,424 --> 00:25:52,847
- Why are you blushing?

530
00:25:52,926 --> 00:25:54,394
Probably because
you want to try it.

531
00:25:55,471 --> 00:25:57,565
Look, I always had a little yen

532
00:25:57,639 --> 00:26:00,734
for sleeping with a woman,
and when I finally did it,

533
00:26:00,809 --> 00:26:03,938
it was... (CHUCKLES)
It was very intense.

534
00:26:04,021 --> 00:26:06,740
It was very exciting,
but unnerving.

535
00:26:08,317 --> 00:26:09,557
- I really have no repressed...

536
00:26:09,568 --> 00:26:13,448
- I shot this TV movie once,
and one of the scenes

537
00:26:13,530 --> 00:26:16,500
was with this incredible
lingerie model.

538
00:26:16,575 --> 00:26:18,327
I mean, she was to die.

539
00:26:19,161 --> 00:26:20,504
And for whatever reason,

540
00:26:20,579 --> 00:26:22,673
I get this message one day

541
00:26:22,748 --> 00:26:24,500
from the assistant director
that Miss Lee

542
00:26:24,583 --> 00:26:27,382
would like me to go
to her dressing room.

543
00:26:27,461 --> 00:26:31,182
And why she was so suddenly
obsessed with me, I don't...

544
00:26:32,841 --> 00:26:34,309
And I go.

545
00:26:35,094 --> 00:26:36,687
And she's in a robe,

546
00:26:38,722 --> 00:26:41,100
and she takes it off,

547
00:26:41,183 --> 00:26:44,312
and gives me a big hug
and kiss,

548
00:26:46,021 --> 00:26:50,572
and I just become crazed.

549
00:26:50,692 --> 00:26:54,913
I mean, I become so excited.

550
00:26:54,988 --> 00:26:57,867
I mean, she was just
too beautiful to turn down.

551
00:27:00,744 --> 00:27:03,543
We had this thing
for, like, three months.

552
00:27:05,624 --> 00:27:08,878
Yeah, it was like being
in an erotic dream.

553
00:27:08,961 --> 00:27:12,215
And on the one hand,
yes, it was very exciting,

554
00:27:14,007 --> 00:27:17,261
but on the other hand,
just very confusing.

555
00:27:17,344 --> 00:27:19,187
And that's when I started
seeing the shrink

556
00:27:19,263 --> 00:27:20,810
five days a week, and...

557
00:27:20,931 --> 00:27:22,604
Well, fortunately,
Jamal came along,

558
00:27:22,683 --> 00:27:24,981
and we had
a great relationship.

559
00:27:26,687 --> 00:27:28,655
And as great

560
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:32,159
as the orgasms were
with Victoria,

561
00:27:33,443 --> 00:27:35,491
they were stronger with Jamal.

562
00:27:35,571 --> 00:27:37,448

- She's something, isn't she?

565
00:27:44,705 --> 00:27:47,675
- Yeah, I think I need a few minutes to
recover from her story.

I'm still vibrating.

567
00:27:49,042 --> 00:27:50,544
- I think she's so fun.

568
00:27:50,627 --> 00:27:52,004
- Yeah, but look, finally,
what has she got?

569
00:27:52,087 --> 00:27:54,510

no relationship

take her, Jack?

JERRY: Giancarlo, I took the liberty
of calling my friend,

1038
00:50:52,091 --> 00:50:54,139
and I set up an audition for you
with the recording company.

1039

- I told you no!

1040

- Why? What do you have
against live people?

You have a great voice.

1044
00:51:04,186 --> 00:51:07,565
You should be singing
<i>Pagliacci</i> for multitudes.

<i>- Pagliacci</i>, yes!

1047

You were born to play that.

1048

singing <i>Pagliacci.</i>

Of course.

Maybe you made
your father nervous.

1098

- I came because
he's a simple man,

1099
00:53:54,314 --> 00:53:55,531

to send him alone

You choose projects
that are doomed to fail.

1112
00:54:22,968 --> 00:54:26,268
You get some kind of a payoff
out of failing.

01:08:51,377 --> 01:08:53,129
She probably
won't stab a woman.

1364
01:08:53,212 --> 01:08:54,259
Go ahead. Go.

1365
01:08:54,339 --> 01:08:55,636
Calm. Calm.

1366
01:08:55,715 --> 01:08:56,967
- Relax. Relax.

1367
01:08:57,050 --> 01:08:58,802
- No, you have
an attitude problem.

1368
01:08:58,885 --> 01:08:59,886
- Put the knife down.

1369
01:08:59,969 --> 01:09:02,222
- We're... This is going to
be our mother-in-law here?

1370
01:09:03,931 --> 01:09:05,478
We wanted you to meet these people.
Mr. Massucci is our firm's CEO.

(SPEAKING ITALIAN)

1372
01:09:08,978 --> 01:09:11,447
He threw this cocktail party
to welcome you.

1373
01:09:11,814 --> 01:09:17,821
It's a chance to meet the <i>creme de
la créme</i> of Rome's business world.

1374
01:09:18,071 --> 01:09:21,746
We talked you up and everyone's
looking forward to meeting you.

1375
01:09:21,866 --> 01:09:25,621
(GIOVANNA SPEAKING ITALIAN) - And it
doesn't hurt to impress their wives.

1376
01:09:26,954 --> 01:09:29,173
- You think it's wise
to drink so much, darling?

1377
01:09:29,332 --> 01:09:31,801
- Maybe I should get some coffee.
Coffee, anyone?

1378
01:09:34,170 --> 01:09:37,390
- There he is! I want to present you
to my nephew. (SAL SPEAKING ITALIAN)

1379
01:09:37,465 --> 01:09:39,183
- Hello everyone!

1380
01:09:39,342 --> 01:09:40,969
Beautiful party, isn't it?

1381
01:09:41,135 --> 01:09:43,263
- This is Antonio.
- Pleased to meet you.

1382
01:09:43,429 --> 01:09:46,979
You're the famous nephew.
I've heard fine things about you.

1383
01:09:47,100 --> 01:09:50,445
They said you fit the image
of the company.

1384
01:09:50,603 --> 01:09:53,356
Image is very important to all of us.

1385
01:09:53,731 --> 01:09:56,405
You follow football?

1386
01:09:56,609 --> 01:09:57,610
- No.

1387
01:10:02,448 --> 01:10:04,951
- It's you.
- Yes.

1388
01:10:05,451 --> 01:10:08,796
- What are you doing here, Anna?
- Milly, Milly.

1389
01:10:08,955 --> 01:10:10,332
- Oh, my wife.

1390
01:10:10,915 --> 01:10:13,509
- How are you?
- Good, thank you.

1391
01:10:13,584 --> 01:10:15,257
- A pleasure.
- The pleasure is mine.

1392
01:10:15,336 --> 01:10:15,962
- Milly.

1393
01:10:16,045 --> 01:10:18,548
We're off. Excuse us.

1394
01:10:18,881 --> 01:10:20,474
- Coffee?

1395
01:10:25,430 --> 01:10:27,478
- Coffee, please.

1396
01:10:28,933 --> 01:10:30,435
- Anna.

1397
01:10:30,893 --> 01:10:31,894
- Hi!

1398
01:10:32,270 --> 01:10:33,271
Milly.

1399
01:10:33,438 --> 01:10:36,112
- Since when is it Milly?
- It's Milly.

1400
01:10:36,524 --> 01:10:39,403
- My wife is here.
- Relax, don't worry.

1401
01:10:41,487 --> 01:10:43,410
- I was going to call you.

1402
01:10:43,573 --> 01:10:46,543
- How's next Tuesday?
- The usual time?

1403
01:10:47,285 --> 01:10:49,583
- Anna.
- Oh God.

1404
01:10:49,954 --> 01:10:52,628
- My goodness, I didn't expect
to see you here.

1405
01:10:52,790 --> 01:10:56,169
- Milly. Here I'm Milly.
- Milly. All right.

1406
01:10:56,502 --> 01:10:59,426
Can you come to my office
tomorrow at three?

1407
01:10:59,589 --> 01:11:01,341
- I don't have my book with me.

1408
01:11:01,507 --> 01:11:05,057
- I see. If I don't hear otherwise
I'll expect you at three.

1409
01:11:05,219 --> 01:11:08,189
And wear the black brassiere
and the thong.

1410
01:11:08,431 --> 01:11:09,933
- Do you sail?

1411
01:11:10,057 --> 01:11:10,899
- No.

1412
01:11:12,560 --> 01:11:13,982
- Do you hunt?

1413
01:11:14,270 --> 01:11:15,112
- No.

1414
01:11:16,397 --> 01:11:19,526
Anna, how are you?
- Milly. Milly, Milly. Milly.

1415
01:11:21,694 --> 01:11:25,449
I'm so nervous. I can't afford to
look foolish. (SPEAKING ITALIAN)

1416
01:11:25,656 --> 01:11:28,079
These men are the most important
business tycoons in Rome.

1417
01:11:28,242 --> 01:11:31,166
- Some <i>créme de la creme.</i>
It's my whole client list.

1418
01:11:31,329 --> 01:11:33,252
- My nerves are shot from today.

1419
01:11:33,414 --> 01:11:36,884
- You're too uptight, honey. Relax.
You'll have a heart attack.

1420
01:11:37,043 --> 01:11:39,717
- How can I relax when
my life is falling apart?

1421
01:11:39,921 --> 01:11:43,141
- How does your wife stand it
if you're always such a wreck?

1422
01:11:43,299 --> 01:11:45,393
- She loves me the way I am.

1423
01:11:45,551 --> 01:11:48,851
Is that why she was smooching
with Luchino what's-his-name?

1424
01:11:48,930 --> 01:11:50,147
Salta.
- Mmm.

1425
01:11:50,431 --> 01:11:52,854
- They were smooching?
- Practically.

1426
01:11:53,017 --> 01:11:54,690
- You said holding hands.

1427
01:11:54,852 --> 01:11:58,106
There must be some explanation.
She's a Madonna.

1428
01:11:58,272 --> 01:12:02,368
- The explanation is he's a movie star,
a sex symbol.

1429
01:12:03,069 --> 01:12:06,369
- And Milly is pretty, but
she'd never look at another man.

1430
01:12:06,531 --> 01:12:08,875
- You obviously don't know women.

1431
01:12:09,158 --> 01:12:13,538
Especially if her husband
is a nervous man afraid of his shadow.

1432
01:12:13,704 --> 01:12:17,459
- What the hell was she doing smooching?
He made love to her with his eyes.

1433
01:12:18,167 --> 01:12:21,216
- You probably don't know how
to make love with your eyes.

1434
01:12:21,379 --> 01:12:25,976
- To a woman of your profession,
I must appear a middle class mouse.

1435
01:12:26,425 --> 01:12:29,178
- Was your wife a virgin
when you married her?

1436
01:12:29,637 --> 01:12:31,230
- None of your business.

1437
01:12:31,639 --> 01:12:33,312
- I'll bet she was.

1438
01:12:34,016 --> 01:12:36,269
- We had some pretty
wild times together.

1439
01:12:36,435 --> 01:12:39,063
- What's your idea of wild times?

1440
01:12:39,230 --> 01:12:41,028
Sex with the lights on?

1441
01:12:41,190 --> 01:12:43,659
- Believe me, she was not a virgin.

1442
01:12:44,485 --> 01:12:46,032
I was.

1443
01:12:47,238 --> 01:12:50,412
- You really need a lesson in love.

1444
01:12:50,575 --> 01:12:52,577
- From who? Surely not you?

1445
01:12:52,702 --> 01:12:53,954
- Why not?

1446
01:12:54,120 --> 01:12:56,964
It's all paid for.

1447
01:12:57,123 --> 01:12:58,670
- There are people...

1448
01:12:58,833 --> 01:13:01,006
- No one can see us.

1449
01:13:08,217 --> 01:13:09,457
Don't let me
forget the carrots.

1450
01:13:09,510 --> 01:13:11,308
- Okay. You really need
all this pasta?

1451
01:13:11,387 --> 01:13:12,980
- Yeah, I think
we need more pasta.

1452
01:13:13,055 --> 01:13:15,183
- More pasta? We're not cooking
for a small village.

1453
01:13:15,266 --> 01:13:16,688
- Tomatoes.
- Okay.

1454
01:13:16,809 --> 01:13:18,436
- Whose idea was
this enterprise?

1455
01:13:18,519 --> 01:13:20,237
- Uh, it was hers.
It was Monica's.

1456
01:13:20,313 --> 01:13:21,565
We all agreed
to have dinner together,

1457
01:13:21,647 --> 01:13:24,150
and since Leonardo's at work all day
and Sally's at school,

1458
01:13:24,233 --> 01:13:25,860
Monica suggested
we do the cooking.

1459
01:13:25,943 --> 01:13:27,695
- Oh. Can I make a prediction?
- What?

1460
01:13:27,778 --> 01:13:29,075
- She can't cook.

1461
01:13:29,155 --> 01:13:31,499
(LAUGHS) - Apparently,
there are some things she can cook.

1462
01:13:31,574 --> 01:13:32,917
- Like what?

1463
01:13:32,992 --> 01:13:34,790
- Like chocolate brownies.

1464
01:13:34,869 --> 01:13:37,918
- Brownies. You're going to have
brownies as a main course?

1465
01:13:37,997 --> 01:13:40,250
- Yeah. Yeah, I think
it should be fun.

1466
01:13:40,333 --> 01:13:41,835
(THUNDER RUMBLING)

1467
01:13:43,336 --> 01:13:45,680
Do you think it needs more wine?
- Mmm, none. Mmm.

1468
01:13:45,755 --> 01:13:47,257
- I mean, I know the Italians
cook with a lot of...

1469
01:13:47,340 --> 01:13:48,557
- There's a lot of wine in here.
- I can really feel it.

1470
01:13:48,633 --> 01:13:50,113
I don't know if it's...
You know, I...

1471
01:13:50,176 --> 01:13:51,769
It might be the French.
- No, no. Let me see.

1472
01:13:51,844 --> 01:13:53,517
- I just... I don't want it
to be too subtle.

1473
01:13:53,596 --> 01:13:54,939
- No, it's definitely not subtle.
- No, I can definitely...

1474
01:13:55,014 --> 01:13:56,974
- Well, can I taste it?
- Yeah, of course. Please.

1475
01:13:57,016 --> 01:13:59,439
- Um... You know,
- I think it needs...

1476
01:13:59,518 --> 01:14:01,941
You know, I'll get some of that
other wine that's there.

1477
01:14:02,021 --> 01:14:04,069
- The other... Are you sure?
We already finished this one.

1478
01:14:04,148 --> 01:14:05,195
- Uh...
- Okay.

1479
01:14:05,274 --> 01:14:06,947
- Oh, oh, we have to put
the brownies in.

1480
01:14:07,026 --> 01:14:08,573
- Can you bake?
- Can I bake?

1481
01:14:08,653 --> 01:14:10,781
You said you baked.
- Well, no, I can.

1482
01:14:10,863 --> 01:14:13,867
I have. I just... I left the recipe
in Los Angeles.

1483
01:14:13,950 --> 01:14:15,623
But, you know, I'll do it.
I can do it by memory.

1484
01:14:15,701 --> 01:14:16,793
I'm sure I can do it by memory.

1485
01:14:16,869 --> 01:14:18,712
- Hey, you want to just order
from a restaurant

1486
01:14:18,788 --> 01:14:21,632
and maybe dirty up the kitchen a little bit
and say we cooked it?

1487
01:14:21,707 --> 01:14:23,835
- Well... Here,
let me check the sauce.

1488
01:14:23,918 --> 01:14:25,591
- Hey, you know what, I'm going to
check it, too, actually.

1489
01:14:25,670 --> 01:14:28,640
- Oh, do you want
penne or rigatoni?

1490
01:14:28,714 --> 01:14:30,842
- Don't put the pasta in now.
They're not going to be home for hours.

1491
01:14:30,925 --> 01:14:32,643
Mmm.
(CHUCKLES)

1492

- What?
I think I'm a little drunk.

01:14:34,053 --> 01:14:35,054
- Really?
- Yeah.

1494

- We can just...
We can fake it.

- Yeah, I'm...
I'm done with this.

- Good. Me, too.
- I'm done with the cooking.

1497
01:14:39,225 --> 01:14:40,943
- Okay.
- I just... I promised Leonardo

1498
01:14:41,018 --> 01:14:42,816
that I'd make
a really great dinner.

1499
01:14:42,895 --> 01:14:44,192
- Yeah.
You know, I'm so...

(STAMMERING)
Look, and this is the wine talking.

1508
01:15:07,378 --> 01:15:09,380
He's not the most
soulful character.

1509
01:15:09,463 --> 01:15:13,468
He's not, um...
He's not a sufferer.

1510
01:15:13,551 --> 01:15:16,430
- What's so great about suffering?
- Well, I just...

1511
01:15:16,512 --> 01:15:18,856
There's something
attractive about a man

1512
01:15:18,931 --> 01:15:21,104
who's sensitive
to the agonies of existence.

1513
01:15:23,269 --> 01:15:25,363
(CHUCKLES)

1514
01:15:25,438 --> 01:15:29,193
- God, you would be perfect
to play Miss Julie.

1515
01:15:29,275 --> 01:15:30,652
The Strindberg play.

1516
01:15:30,735 --> 01:15:32,533
- The Miss Julie tactic
I learned

1517
01:15:32,611 --> 01:15:34,579
from a friend of mine
who's a theater director.

1518
01:15:34,655 --> 01:15:35,935
Tell any actress
she'd be perfect

1519
01:15:35,990 --> 01:15:37,207
for the role of Miss Julie,

1520
01:15:37,283 --> 01:15:38,375
and you can have
your way with her.

1521
01:15:38,451 --> 01:15:41,546
- I'm just so amazed
that you would say that.

1522
01:15:41,620 --> 01:15:45,420
I mean, Miss Julie is the role that
I was born to play.

1523
01:15:45,499 --> 01:15:46,671
She is me.

1524
01:15:47,877 --> 01:15:49,675
How could you know that?

1525

scenes that I have to do.

01:29:34,327 --> 01:29:36,170
And although I hear
he does a lot of drugs,

1799
01:29:36,246 --> 01:29:39,045
somehow that burnt-out look
is just so...

1800
01:29:39,833 --> 01:29:41,676

to be a celebrity...

2028
01:45:12,598 --> 01:45:13,975
Just don't tell my dad.

2029
01:45:14,058 --> 01:45:16,152
Thankfully, he doesn't
understand a word of Italian.

2030
01:45:16,227 --> 01:45:20,949
- All right, um, "Except from Mr. Santoli's
magnificent voice..."

2031
01:45:21,023 --> 01:45:22,491
- Magnifico!
(LAUGHTER)

2032
01:45:22,566 --> 01:45:23,863
(MARIANGELA
SPEAKING ITALIAN)

2033
01:45:24,819 --> 01:45:26,742
- "...whoever imbecile..."

2034
01:45:26,862 --> 01:45:28,114
(STAMMERS) imbecile?

2035
01:45:28,197 --> 01:45:29,665
- Yeah, imbecile.

2036
01:45:29,740 --> 01:45:34,712
- "...whoever imbecile conceived this, um,
moronic experience

2037
01:45:34,787 --> 01:45:38,132
"should be taken
out and beheaded."

2038
01:45:38,207 --> 01:45:41,677
- Oh. - Oh, well.
He's gotten worse.

2039
01:45:41,752 --> 01:45:44,346
This has to be the most beautiful terrace
in all of Rome.

2040
01:45:44,421 --> 01:45:47,174
- Yeah. For my wife and I, it's a privilege
to live up here.

2041
01:45:47,258 --> 01:45:50,353
- Oh, yeah. I mean, the Spanish Steps right
there, the people watching.

2042
01:45:50,427 --> 01:45:52,521
- Phyllis, the reviews
were so great.

2043
01:45:52,596 --> 01:45:55,600
(STAMMERING) I mean,
the press called me, um...

2044
01:45:55,683 --> 01:45:57,244
Not, not... What was
the word they used?

2045
01:45:57,268 --> 01:46:00,943
Not a maestro, but a,
um... An "imbechile."

2046
01:46:01,021 --> 01:46:02,989
What does it mean?

2047
01:46:03,065 --> 01:46:04,408
- Means you're ahead
of your time.

2048
01:46:04,483 --> 01:46:07,578
- Your mother, I'm happy to say,
lucky woman,

2049
01:46:07,653 --> 01:46:09,200
married an "imbechile."

2050
01:46:09,280 --> 01:46:11,499
- So I toast to
my future father-in-law.

2051
01:46:11,574 --> 01:46:13,872
- Ah. Well,
good luck to you guys.

2052
01:46:13,951 --> 01:46:14,918
- Honey, let's go
see the piazza.

2053
01:46:14,994 --> 01:46:17,372
- Yes. Yeah.
- Gotta click, 'cause...

2054
01:46:17,454 --> 01:46:19,374
- So glad to see them.
They make a lovely couple.

2055
01:46:21,125 --> 01:46:22,798
- Wow.
(SIGHS) - Oh.

2056
01:46:22,877 --> 01:46:24,220
This city is unbelievable.

2057
01:46:25,629 --> 01:46:26,926
Think we should get married

2058
01:46:27,006 --> 01:46:28,553
right in front of
the fountain there.

2059
01:46:28,632 --> 01:46:30,134
- Anything you want.
(CHUCKLES)

2060
01:46:31,218 --> 01:46:32,936
- Oh, I could
stand here all night,

2061
01:46:33,012 --> 01:46:34,309
it's so beautiful.

2062
01:46:37,141 --> 01:46:38,688
<i>(BAND PLAYING VOLARE)</i>

2063
01:47:09,840 --> 01:47:12,389
It's me that knows
Rome the best,

2064
01:47:12,468 --> 01:47:14,687
not a traffic policeman
or anyone.

2065
01:47:15,346 --> 01:47:18,225
I see all from here.

2066
01:47:18,307 --> 01:47:21,186
The Romans, the students,

2067
01:47:21,268 --> 01:47:23,612
the lovers
on the Spanish Steps.

2068
01:47:25,356 --> 01:47:28,860
There are many stories,
next time you come.

2069
01:47:28,943 --> 01:47:30,695
