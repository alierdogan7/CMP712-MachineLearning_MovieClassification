00:00:19,409 --> 00:00:24,969
<i>(man) Although your diplomas
are equally specific, remember:</i>

2
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:28,407
You are all going out
into the world as individuals.

3
00:00:28,907 --> 00:00:32,096
I now proudly present

4
00:00:32,879 --> 00:00:37,869
this year's Woodrow Wilson School
of Public and International Affairs

5
00:00:38,273 --> 00:00:39,720
graduating class.

6
00:00:53,965 --> 00:00:55,663
Go, go, go.

7
00:00:57,098 --> 00:00:58,426
- Bye. We love you.
- You have to write.

8
00:00:59,349 --> 00:01:02,745
- Thank your mom for all the cookies, OK?
- I'm very proud of you.

9
00:01:09,771 --> 00:01:12,173
<i>(Mia) Dear diary.</i>

10
00:01:12,734 --> 00:01:16,860
<i>Well, it's me. Brand-new
college graduate-slash-princess.</i>

11
00:01:17,383 --> 00:01:20,549
<i>Oh, I can't believe it's been five years</i>

12
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:22,195
<i>since Grandma told me
that I was a princess.</i>

13
00:01:23,808 --> 00:01:29,091
Me? A... a princess? Shut up.

14
00:01:30,131 --> 00:01:32,381
<i>And right after that,
my mother surprised me</i>

15
00:01:32,381 --> 00:01:34,975
<i>by marrying my high-school teacher,
Patrick O'Connell.</i>

16
00:01:35,498 --> 00:01:38,882
<i>It must be going well,
because they are now expecting a baby.</i>

17
00:01:39,716 --> 00:01:43,978
<i>Lilly's remained the same,
as she continues to cause turmoil,</i>

18
00:01:43,978 --> 00:01:46,415
<i>but now as a graduate
student at Berkeley.</i>

19
00:01:46,991 --> 00:01:48,537
<i>Which she calls "Berserkeley. "</i>

20
00:01:50,601 --> 00:01:52,242
<i>"How's Michael?” you may ask.</i>

21
00:01:52,811 --> 00:01:56,382
<i>Well, we're just friends now, as he
went off to tour the country with his band.</i>

22
00:01:57,822 --> 00:01:58,749
Princess Mia.

23
00:01:59,290 --> 00:02:02,477
Look out the window,
and welcome back to Genovia.

24
00:02:11,622 --> 00:02:14,540
<i>Oh, there it is. My beautiful Genovia.</i>

25
00:02:15,812 --> 00:02:19,948
<i>Of course, I'm completely excited to be
going back, but I'm also a bit nervous.</i>

26
00:02:20,946 --> 00:02:22,124
<i>(man) Genovia One has landed.</i>

27
00:02:22,374 --> 00:02:24,915
<i>(Mia) Grandma Clarisse will step down
by the end of this year as queen,</i>

28
00:02:24,915 --> 00:02:27,008
<i>and I'll be taking over, since I'm now 21.</i>

29
00:02:27,679 --> 00:02:29,228
<i>Mira, la princesa Mia.</i>

30
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:31,789
It's the princess from America! Hi.

31
00:02:32,416 --> 00:02:33,604
<i>(man) Viva la princesa.</i>

32
00:02:34,134 --> 00:02:37,228
<i>I know I studied diplomacy
and political science at school, but...</i>

33
00:02:37,478 --> 00:02:41,383
<i>there is no course in "Queen,"
or "How To Run A Country 101."</i>

34
00:02:42,447 --> 00:02:46,123
<i>But Grandma's going to help me, and
I'll take over when she thinks I'm ready.</i>

35
00:02:46,813 --> 00:02:50,133
<i>Of course, I wonder... will I ever be ready?</i>

36
00:02:50,648 --> 00:02:54,477
<i>In the meantime, I'm going to live
in a beautiful palace like in a fairy tale,</i>

37
00:02:54,477 --> 00:02:58,199
<i>and eventually sit on a throne
and rule the people of Genovia.</i>

38
00:02:58,961 --> 00:03:00,324
<i>Is that scary or what?</i>

39
00:03:01,098 --> 00:03:03,160
<i>Well, maybe Fat Louie
can give me some help.</i>

40
00:03:05,694 --> 00:03:10,630
Her Royal Highness Princess Amelia
Mignonette Thermopolis Renaldi

41
00:03:11,113 --> 00:03:11,944
has arrived.

42
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:15,435
Welcome home, Princess.

43
00:03:17,349 --> 00:03:20,946
And her royal pussycat, Sir Fat Louie.

44
00:03:24,413 --> 00:03:28,444
<i>The one downer in my fairy tale
is I've never been in love.</i>

45
00:03:28,882 --> 00:03:31,435
Countess Puck of Austria.

46
00:03:32,872 --> 00:03:35,819
<i>However, this evening
is my 21st-birthday party,</i>

47
00:03:36,353 --> 00:03:40,524
<i>and our tradition says I have to dance
with all the eligible bachelors in Genovia.</i>

48
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:43,406
<i>So maybe I'll meet
my Prince Charming tonight.</i>

49
00:03:47,691 --> 00:03:48,931
<i>(woman) The queen is coming.</i>

50
00:03:50,197 --> 00:03:52,218
Here she comes. Look alive.

51
00:03:52,885 --> 00:03:53,843
Places.

52
00:03:55,137 --> 00:03:56,905
She'll have a double-door entrance.

53
00:03:57,792 --> 00:03:59,559
The eagle is flying.
Repeat, the eagle is flying.

54
00:04:00,093 --> 00:04:00,873
She's in the foyer.

55
00:04:13,854 --> 00:04:15,054
Beautiful.

56
00:04:20,543 --> 00:04:21,919
But you're late, Your Majesty.

57
00:04:22,169 --> 00:04:26,657
A queen is never late.
Everyone else is simply early.

58
00:04:26,916 --> 00:04:27,635
Of course.

59
00:04:28,594 --> 00:04:30,919
<i>(man) Her Majesty
Clarisse Renaldi,</i>

60
00:04:31,201 --> 00:04:33,887

Greetings, good friends.

00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:53,544
I am delighted
to welcome you here this evening.

<i>(# chamber music)</i>

65
00:05:00,012 --> 00:05:01,825
- Thank you.
- I hope they have string cheese.

66
00:05:02,058 --> 00:05:04,011
Ah, good.

67
00:05:06,169 --> 00:05:11,251
Many of you will remember King Rupert's
and my granddaughter, Princess Mia.

68
00:05:11,605 --> 00:05:14,262
<i>(all) King Rupert. May he rest in peace.</i>

69
00:05:14,607 --> 00:05:17,720
Will you please
raise your glasses in celebration

70
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:21,683
of Princess Mia's 21st birthday.

71
00:05:22,295 --> 00:05:27,411
Presenting Her Royal Highness
Amelia Mignonette Thermopolis Renaldi,

72
00:05:27,637 --> 00:05:30,608
Princess of Genovia.

73
00:05:33,014 --> 00:05:34,214

00:05:49,623 --> 00:05:51,107
To Princess Mia.

<i>(all) To Princess Mia.</i>

77
00:05:58,378 --> 00:06:00,160
- It happens all the time.
- Oh!

78
00:06:00,410 --> 00:06:03,378
- And happy birthday.
- Thank you.

79
00:06:04,567 --> 00:06:06,247
<i>(speaks Greek)</i>

80
00:06:09,315 --> 00:06:11,724
<i>- Oh, I don't speak Greek.
- (speaks Greek)</i>

81
00:06:11,724 --> 00:06:14,628
<i>- And you obviously don't speak English.
- (speaks Greek)</i>

82
00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:19,129
One, two, three.
One, two, three.

83
00:06:19,129 --> 00:06:22,162
One, two, three. One, two, three.

84
00:06:22,162 --> 00:06:23,996
- One, two...
- Ow!

85
00:06:23,996 --> 00:06:24,723
Sorry.

86
00:06:25,566 --> 00:06:28,942
<i>(muttering in French)</i>

87
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:34,318
- Have you met the princess yet?
- Briefly. But she wasn't very friendly.

88
00:06:34,537 --> 00:06:38,496
I got a hello and a goodbye.
Is this an American custom?

89
00:06:44,271 --> 00:06:48,345
- I saw that.
- Oh, uh...

90
00:06:48,554 --> 00:06:51,345
<i>(squealing)</i>

91
00:06:51,595 --> 00:06:52,754
Oh, I've missed you.

92
00:06:53,116 --> 00:06:54,501
- Sebastian.
- Majesty.

93
00:06:54,501 --> 00:06:55,943
- Sheila.
- Majesty.

94
00:06:56,152 --> 00:06:59,283
- What have you been up to?
- Oh, just partying, girl. You know.

95
00:06:59,283 --> 00:07:03,244
Oh, your foot. I'm so sorry. Are...

96
00:07:03,244 --> 00:07:04,275
Are you all right?

97
00:07:04,275 --> 00:07:05,405
I'll survive, Your Highness.

98
00:07:05,671 --> 00:07:08,247
The fault was entirely my own. I apologize.

99
00:07:08,450 --> 00:07:12,325
Are you sure you don't want to
exchange licenses and proof of insurance?

100
00:07:12,544 --> 00:07:14,538
No, no. These shoes
were a little big anyway.

101
00:07:14,764 --> 00:07:16,583
The swelling should help them fit better.

102
00:07:25,521 --> 00:07:27,118
Hey, get a load of this guy.

103
00:07:27,417 --> 00:07:29,733
Shimmy shimmy.

104
00:07:31,073 --> 00:07:34,478
<i>Hey, hey, hey. Bitte.</i>

105
00:07:34,699 --> 00:07:37,140
- You are a beautiful dancer.
- Oh, why, thank you so much.

106
00:07:37,356 --> 00:07:38,430
Like a deer.

107
00:07:39,146 --> 00:07:40,931
Or a chipmunk in the forest.

108
00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:43,919
Looks like he's trying to land a plane.

109
00:07:44,648 --> 00:07:47,358
Woodland animals
are a lovely thing to be compared to.

110
00:07:47,577 --> 00:07:48,297
May I?

111
00:07:54,772 --> 00:07:57,619
- Your timing is impeccable. Thank you.
- You're welcome, Your Highness.

112
00:07:57,837 --> 00:07:59,608
Mia. I like to be called Mia.

113
00:07:59,608 --> 00:08:02,178
And you are?

114
00:08:02,618 --> 00:08:03,883
Nicholas. Just Nicholas.

115
00:08:04,773 --> 00:08:08,023
Well, I'm very glad to see that my
clumsiness hasn't affected your dancing.

116
00:08:08,324 --> 00:08:09,927
I'm sorry I stepped on your foot.

117
00:08:11,116 --> 00:08:12,462
You can step on my foot anytime.

118
00:08:14,836 --> 00:08:16,350
Aww.

119
00:08:19,506 --> 00:08:22,556
It is Prince Jacques' turn.

120
00:08:27,870 --> 00:08:28,619
Your Highness.

121
00:08:31,391 --> 00:08:33,992
If this were my party,
we'd be kissing by now.

122
00:08:35,745 --> 00:08:39,420
That's Prince Jacques.
He's about 12 years old.

123
00:08:39,420 --> 00:08:40,776
He's a very precocious prince.

124
00:08:41,649 --> 00:08:44,109
He wears aftershave
to make people think that he's older.

125
00:08:45,110 --> 00:08:46,666
May I blow in your ear?

126
00:08:47,696 --> 00:08:48,869
Can you reach it?

127
00:08:50,138 --> 00:08:53,370
Princess, there's someone
from parliament you should meet.

128
00:08:53,650 --> 00:08:57,421
Charlotte, how many
members of parliament are there?

129
00:08:57,421 --> 00:08:58,639
Only two left, Your Highness.

130
00:09:00,962 --> 00:09:02,795
- Cake, ladies?
- Oh, dear.

131
00:09:03,045 --> 00:09:05,419
Oh, Your Highness, pardon me,
I am so sorry. It was only an accident.

132
00:09:05,678 --> 00:09:07,744
It's fine, it's fine.
No harm, no foul, no bruise.

133
00:09:08,135 --> 00:09:10,414
Thank you so much.

134
00:09:11,381 --> 00:09:13,232
You should be more careful,
Your Royal Highness.

135
00:09:14,335 --> 00:09:16,294
Somebody might try
to take that away from you.

136
00:09:16,962 --> 00:09:19,335
Oh, I hope not.
But thank you so much for all your help.

137
00:09:20,121 --> 00:09:22,950
Someone like me.

138
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:26,387
<i>Welcome back to "Eggs with Elsie. "</i>

139
00:09:26,794 --> 00:09:30,806
<i>I'm Elsie Kentworthy,
and today's topic is Princess Mia.</i>

140
00:09:31,024 --> 00:09:32,726
Hi. How's it going?

141
00:09:32,726 --> 00:09:35,875
- So sorry, I thought I was alone.
- No, Miss.

142
00:09:36,401 --> 00:09:39,127
I'm Brigitte, if it pleases you.
At your service.

143
00:09:39,127 --> 00:09:42,353
- And I'm Brigitta, Miss.
- Brigitte and Brigitta, I'm Mia.

144
00:09:42,353 --> 00:09:44,513
And, please, you don't...
Don't curtsy like that.

145
00:09:44,729 --> 00:09:47,637
- Not like this? How do you like it, then?
- Like this, maybe?

146
00:09:47,637 --> 00:09:50,511
No, no, no, I didn't mean, like, you know...

147
00:09:50,511 --> 00:09:52,917
No, no, not that way. I didn't mean it, um...

148
00:09:52,917 --> 00:09:57,419
The queen bids you good morning,
Princess. She's in session with parliament.

149
00:09:57,419 --> 00:09:59,657
- OK.
- I see you've met your lady's maids.

150
00:09:59,657 --> 00:10:01,032
Yeah. Um...

151
00:10:01,032 --> 00:10:04,246
- How do you turn off the curtsies?
- Oh.

152
00:10:04,246 --> 00:10:06,344
Enough bowing. Back to your chores.

153
00:10:06,566 --> 00:10:10,105
Her Majesty will meet you
in one hour at the throne room.

154
00:10:10,356 --> 00:10:12,751
- OK.
- I'm sorry your suite isn't ready yet.

155
00:10:12,952 --> 00:10:14,794
But you're welcome
to stay here in Her Majesty's suite...

156
00:10:14,794 --> 00:10:16,231
No, no, no, no, it's fine. It's...

157
00:10:16,231 --> 00:10:19,532
Hey, can I explore
the palace a little bit?

158
00:10:19,532 --> 00:10:20,951
<i>- Of course.
- (dog barks)</i>

159
00:10:21,170 --> 00:10:22,982
Oh. Well, you've met Maurice.

160
00:10:23,214 --> 00:10:25,260
<i>(Mia) Hey, Mo.</i>

161
00:10:26,107 --> 00:10:27,372
The throne room, in an hour.

162
00:10:28,669 --> 00:10:32,637
The parliament of Genovia is in session.
Prime Minister Motaz presiding.

163
00:10:32,637 --> 00:10:35,041
Viscount Mabrey, you have the floor.

164
00:10:35,473 --> 00:10:37,607
<i>(man) Monsieur Mabrey, s'il vous plaît.</i>

165
00:10:37,607 --> 00:10:43,325
As we all know, the 21st birthday
of an heir to the Genovian bloodline

166
00:10:43,325 --> 00:10:45,723
is indeed a matter
of great public significance.

167
00:10:46,169 --> 00:10:51,687
It signifies that this young person
is eligible to assume the crown.

168
00:10:52,077 --> 00:10:54,762
Indeed, we are well aware of this, Viscount.

169
00:10:55,137 --> 00:10:57,754
The queen has already
indicated that Princess Mia

170
00:10:57,754 --> 00:11:02,190
intends to learn more at her side
before assuming the throne.

171
00:11:02,545 --> 00:11:06,974
It was not Princess Mia
to whom I was referring.

172
00:11:27,181 --> 00:11:28,898
Oh, wow.

173
00:11:33,396 --> 00:11:35,244
King Chevalier

174
00:11:35,930 --> 00:11:40,367
was the great-great-great-grandfather of...

175
00:11:40,829 --> 00:11:41,929
Hello?

176
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:43,991
Ah... Oh.

177
00:11:45,181 --> 00:11:46,340
<i>(clears throat)</i>

178
00:11:47,743 --> 00:11:48,663
Proceed.

179
00:11:51,382 --> 00:11:52,222
<i>(gasps)</i>

180
00:11:57,859 --> 00:11:58,837
Nice.

181
00:12:04,013 --> 00:12:04,834
Hello?

182
00:12:22,894 --> 00:12:23,829
<i>(Mabrey) So.</i>

183
00:12:24,443 --> 00:12:27,580
As of the 20th of October last year,

184
00:12:28,226 --> 00:12:32,769
on the occasion of his 21st birthday,

185
00:12:33,501 --> 00:12:38,894
another Genovian of the royal bloodline
became eligible to assume the throne.

186
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:39,923
What?

187
00:12:40,568 --> 00:12:42,912
My nephew, Lord Devereaux.

188
00:12:43,662 --> 00:12:45,864
I beg your pardon?

189
00:12:45,864 --> 00:12:49,011
My nephew's mother was my wife's sister.

190
00:12:49,706 --> 00:12:53,520
Therefore, Your Majesty,
I am pleased to say

191
00:12:54,017 --> 00:12:56,511
that my nephew
is ready to take his place

192
00:12:56,864 --> 00:12:59,705
as Genovia's rightful king.

193
00:13:02,627 --> 00:13:04,411
Shut up.

194
00:13:05,631 --> 00:13:06,750
I beg your pardon?

195
00:13:07,085 --> 00:13:11,884
- I mean...
- "Shut up" doesn't always mean shut up.

196
00:13:12,122 --> 00:13:13,508
<i>"Taisez-vous" veut dire...</i>

197
00:13:13,508 --> 00:13:16,354
In America, it's like
"Oh, my," "Gee whiz," "Wow. "

198
00:13:16,354 --> 00:13:17,598
<i>- "Fantastique," "Superbe," "Oy vey. "
- Yeah, thank you, Mr. Prime Minister.</i>

199
00:13:18,223 --> 00:13:21,440
But isn't Princess Mia
first in line to ascend the throne?

200
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:22,160
Not yet.

201
00:13:22,877 --> 00:13:26,566
Genovian law states
that a princess must marry

202
00:13:26,566 --> 00:13:28,993
before she can take the throne.

203
00:13:28,993 --> 00:13:31,442
<i>(Clarisse) We have never
enforced that law.</i>

204
00:13:31,651 --> 00:13:34,412
A man doesn't have to marry to be king.

205
00:13:34,412 --> 00:13:37,254
I mean, this is the 21st century,
for heaven's sake.

206
00:13:37,254 --> 00:13:41,113
My granddaughter should
be given the same rights as any man.

207
00:13:41,113 --> 00:13:42,174
Yeah!

208
00:13:46,798 --> 00:13:52,330
Genovia shall have no queen
lest she be bound in matrimony.

209
00:13:53,291 --> 00:13:55,018
Lord Palimore?

210
00:13:55,331 --> 00:13:59,517
That is the law of Genovia
for the last 300 years.

211
00:14:00,007 --> 00:14:04,267
Princess Mia is not qualified to rule
because she is unmarried.

212
00:14:04,644 --> 00:14:06,290
Forgive me, Your Majesty.

213
00:14:07,083 --> 00:14:09,852
Not all of us are sure that the princess

214
00:14:10,175 --> 00:14:15,516
is the most suitable choice
to govern our great nation.

215
00:14:15,829 --> 00:14:17,205
<i>(all) Ooh!</i>

216
00:14:17,205 --> 00:14:18,847
Now, now, gentlemen, gentlemen. Please.

217
00:14:18,847 --> 00:14:22,259
I suggest this honored body

218
00:14:22,259 --> 00:14:24,893
allow Princess Mia one year,

219
00:14:25,225 --> 00:14:27,261
during which time she must marry,

220
00:14:27,261 --> 00:14:31,831
or she forfeits the throne
of Genovia to young Lord Devereaux.

221
00:14:31,831 --> 00:14:32,911
What? No.

222
00:14:32,911 --> 00:14:35,914
- I object. I object most strongly.
- One year?

223
00:14:36,413 --> 00:14:37,382
- 60 days.
- Two months.

224
00:14:37,382 --> 00:14:38,686
60 days?

225
00:14:38,686 --> 00:14:39,965
30 days.

226
00:14:41,993 --> 00:14:45,836
How could parliament expect me
to fall in love in 30 days? It's like...

227
00:14:46,199 --> 00:14:49,418
It's like it's a big trick to get me
to have an arranged marriage, or...

228
00:14:50,915 --> 00:14:52,043
No.

229
00:14:53,053 --> 00:14:55,325
No, there's no...
That's it, there's no "or. " There's... I...

230
00:14:55,668 --> 00:14:57,400
An arranged marriage is my only choice.

231
00:14:58,344 --> 00:15:01,659
What kind of person
agrees to an arranged marriage?

232
00:15:04,052 --> 00:15:04,894
Uh...

233
00:15:05,613 --> 00:15:07,925
You agreed to an arranged marriage.

234
00:15:08,769 --> 00:15:10,846
- Right.
- Yes, I did.

235
00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:14,532
And it turned out quite splendidly.

236
00:15:15,175 --> 00:15:19,948
He was my best friend.
We grew very fond of each other.

237
00:15:20,409 --> 00:15:22,239
I'm sure, Grandma, but...

238
00:15:22,878 --> 00:15:26,579
I dream of love, not fondness.

239
00:15:27,070 --> 00:15:30,318
But you don't have to do this, Mia.
You don't have to become queen.

240
00:15:32,502 --> 00:15:36,014
This is so unfair.

241
00:15:42,706 --> 00:15:43,799
<i>(man's voice) Amelia.</i>

242
00:15:44,378 --> 00:15:47,097
<i>(both) Courage is not the absence of fear,</i>

243
00:15:47,954 --> 00:15:53,283
<i>(alone) but rather the judgment
that something else is more important...</i>

244
00:15:54,564 --> 00:15:55,429
than fear.

245
00:15:58,368 --> 00:16:03,408
There are 550 years
of Renaldis on these walls.

246
00:16:04,691 --> 00:16:06,815
And I will be up there
next to my father.

247
00:16:09,317 --> 00:16:13,768
I'm sure I want my chance
to make a difference as a ruler.

248
00:16:15,565 --> 00:16:18,224
Spoken like a true queen.

249
00:16:24,221 --> 00:16:27,099
You, my boy, a true-born Genovian.

250
00:16:27,659 --> 00:16:28,912
You should be our king.

251
00:16:30,566 --> 00:16:31,205
I agree.

252
00:16:32,393 --> 00:16:35,394
But how can we make it happen?

253
00:16:36,503 --> 00:16:38,244
Give me one of your arrows.

254
00:16:38,629 --> 00:16:41,798
I'm going to show you a trick that
I learned from an old Italian philosopher.

255
00:16:42,098 --> 00:16:43,392
Niccolò Machiavelli.

256
00:16:43,957 --> 00:16:49,517
I can make this dart
hit the bull's-eye every time.

257
00:16:50,807 --> 00:16:51,647
<i>(yells)</i>

258
00:16:55,003 --> 00:16:57,974
Yes, but that is cheating.

259
00:16:58,192 --> 00:16:58,849
You've got it.

260
00:17:00,317 --> 00:17:04,973
Lord Devereaux will be arriving shortly,
Mrs. Kout, with his snake of an uncle.

261
00:17:04,973 --> 00:17:05,913
Yes, Your Majesty.

262
00:17:07,309 --> 00:17:08,756
- Your Majesty.
- Hm?

263
00:17:08,756 --> 00:17:12,755
I know Lionel is the prime minister's
nephew and he's interning for the summer

264
00:17:12,755 --> 00:17:14,319
because he wants to learn about security.

265
00:17:15,145 --> 00:17:18,998
But he never leaves my side.
He sticks to me like Velcro, madam.

266
00:17:19,255 --> 00:17:22,458
It won't last very long.
He returns to school in the autumn.

267
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:24,661
- He wants an audience with you.
- What, now?

268
00:17:24,661 --> 00:17:25,537
Now.

269
00:17:26,806 --> 00:17:27,645
Lionel?

270
00:17:29,630 --> 00:17:30,350
Short.

271
00:17:32,410 --> 00:17:35,456
I don't know if you've met
Mrs. Kout, our housekeeper,

272
00:17:35,456 --> 00:17:37,587
and Priscilla and Olivia, my lady's maids.

273
00:17:38,609 --> 00:17:40,091
I'm doing a background check on Olivia.

274
00:17:40,492 --> 00:17:43,071
Oh, that's not necessary, Lionel.

275
00:17:43,071 --> 00:17:46,402
Everybody in this room
has high-priority clearance.

276
00:17:46,618 --> 00:17:47,609
Of course, of course.

277
00:17:48,291 --> 00:17:49,776
- Your Majesty?
- Hm?

278
00:17:50,197 --> 00:17:53,049
I would gladly take a bullet for you.

279
00:17:54,173 --> 00:17:55,214
Oh, how brave.

280
00:17:55,809 --> 00:17:58,588
Most interns don't even
want to fetch me my tea.

281
00:17:59,027 --> 00:18:00,734
The limousine is at the gates, madam.

282
00:18:08,775 --> 00:18:11,416
<i>(Clarisse) The viscount
is not staying, just the nephew.</i>

283
00:18:11,632 --> 00:18:14,525
Joseph, I want you to protect him
and keep your eye on him at all times.

284
00:18:15,352 --> 00:18:17,024
- Of course. Lionel.
- Oh, hello.

285
00:18:17,266 --> 00:18:19,882
So is this all right to welcome
the viscount and his nephew?

286
00:18:19,882 --> 00:18:21,603
Very appropriate. And pretty.

287
00:18:21,826 --> 00:18:25,429
Oh, I can't believe
parliament invited the guy

288
00:18:25,429 --> 00:18:28,071
who's trying to steal the throne
to stay here with us at the palace.

289
00:18:28,415 --> 00:18:29,978
Oh, no, parliament didn't invite him.

290
00:18:30,245 --> 00:18:31,201
I did.

291
00:18:32,306 --> 00:18:33,070
Wha...

292
00:18:33,712 --> 00:18:36,308
I offered to have him
hung by his toes in our courtyard.

293
00:18:36,308 --> 00:18:39,229
- Excuse me.
- Yeah, what about Joe's suggestion, huh?

294
00:18:39,914 --> 00:18:45,055
No. If there's any mischief going on,
I'd prefer it be right under my nose.

295
00:18:50,306 --> 00:18:51,882
<i>(Mabrey) It's not a very difficult job,
you know.</i>

296
00:18:51,882 --> 00:18:54,854
You just have to open the door
before the passenger dies of old age.

297
00:18:54,854 --> 00:18:59,103
- Hello, I'm here to welcome you.
- Your staff is incompetent and unreliable.

298
00:18:59,478 --> 00:19:02,290
I just so don't want
to be nice to this guy, you know?

299
00:19:02,713 --> 00:19:05,309
I mean, he is rude,
he's arrogant, self-centered, he's...

300
00:19:05,309 --> 00:19:06,618
Ah, well, have you met him?

301
00:19:06,869 --> 00:19:09,914
- No.
- Neither have I.

302
00:19:10,416 --> 00:19:12,370
Yeah, but he probably is, Grandma.
I mean...

303
00:19:12,682 --> 00:19:16,703
Like, now, all of a sudden, out of nowhere,
he wants to be the king of Genovia?

304
00:19:17,027 --> 00:19:20,087
- What is that about?
- Oh, tush.

305
00:19:20,417 --> 00:19:22,934
Whatever he is, we will be charm itself.

306
00:19:22,934 --> 00:19:26,229
We will present ourselves
with grace and poise.

307
00:19:26,431 --> 00:19:30,269
<i>(man) Announcing Viscount Mabrey
and Lord Devereaux.</i>

308
00:19:35,498 --> 00:19:36,312
<i>(Mabrey) Your Majesty.</i>

309
00:19:36,751 --> 00:19:39,092
- Your Highness.
- Mabrey.

310
00:19:39,498 --> 00:19:43,828
Ma'am, may I introduce my nephew,
Lord Nicholas Devereaux.

311
00:19:44,612 --> 00:19:48,485
Nicholas. We are delighted
to make your acquaintance.

312
00:19:48,485 --> 00:19:50,015
Your Majesty, the pleasure is all mine.

313
00:19:50,936 --> 00:19:53,600
And thank you so much
for inviting me to stay at the palace.

314
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:56,641
May I present my granddaughter Mia.

315
00:19:57,706 --> 00:19:59,017
Your Highness.

316
00:20:02,236 --> 00:20:04,831
Mia, would you care to welcome our guest?

317
00:20:09,205 --> 00:20:12,063
Lord Nicholas.

318
00:20:12,876 --> 00:20:13,956
<i>(Lionel sniggers)</i>

319
00:20:19,225 --> 00:20:20,064
She always does that.

320
00:20:20,517 --> 00:20:22,144
Uh...

321
00:20:22,455 --> 00:20:25,046
I will personally
get some ice for that foot,

322
00:20:25,046 --> 00:20:27,127
and I'll be with you
as quickly as I possibly can.

323
00:20:29,249 --> 00:20:30,112
An accident.

324
00:20:31,125 --> 00:20:32,062
Of course.

325
00:20:33,395 --> 00:20:36,266
She's training to be a flamenco dancer.

326
00:20:41,298 --> 00:20:44,379
Would you care to explain
what was going on out there?

327
00:20:44,735 --> 00:20:45,360
Sorry.

328
00:20:46,128 --> 00:20:50,379
I, uh, have met Lord Nicholas, actually.

329
00:20:50,713 --> 00:20:53,704
Yep. At the ball. Didn't know
who he was, so, you know, we...

330
00:20:54,098 --> 00:20:57,160
We danced, and I flirted.

331
00:20:57,800 --> 00:21:00,111
I feel so stupid right now.

332
00:21:00,566 --> 00:21:04,338
I see. Well, as your queen
I absolutely cannot condone it.

333
00:21:05,774 --> 00:21:08,284
As a grandma, I say, "right on. "

334
00:21:10,158 --> 00:21:13,418
Now, if you'll come with me,
I have something to show you.

335
00:21:13,994 --> 00:21:16,783
- Oh, yeah.
- I think you could leave that right there.

336
00:21:17,386 --> 00:21:19,122
Uh... Yeah.

337
00:21:19,122 --> 00:21:20,494
Thank you, culinary people.

338
00:21:21,197 --> 00:21:22,408
<i>(whispers) I'll be back.</i>

339
00:21:23,431 --> 00:21:26,652
The renovations for your suite
are finally finished.

340
00:21:26,886 --> 00:21:28,909
Should have been ready for you
when you arrived,

341
00:21:29,169 --> 00:21:33,995
but unfortunately we asked
Rupert's cousin to do the bathroom.

342
00:21:34,199 --> 00:21:38,573
It's a good lesson. Nepotism
belongs in the arts, not in plumbing.

343
00:21:43,182 --> 00:21:46,030
This is your very own suite.

344
00:21:46,545 --> 00:21:48,869
- Are you serious? This is...
- Mm-hm.

345
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:50,887
<i>(gasps)</i>

346
00:21:53,608 --> 00:21:56,390
- This is my room?
- Yes.

347
00:21:56,797 --> 00:21:58,218
Oh, Grandma.

348
00:21:59,403 --> 00:22:02,358
This is very nice.

349
00:22:02,608 --> 00:22:03,379
Good.

350
00:22:11,013 --> 00:22:12,311
We just made the bed.

351
00:22:12,591 --> 00:22:15,469
This is so cool.

352
00:22:15,829 --> 00:22:20,608
<i>(Clarisse) Ah, Fat Louie. I think
he rather likes his new abode as well.</i>

353
00:22:21,593 --> 00:22:22,890
There's more.

354
00:22:34,275 --> 00:22:37,211
- Is that mine?
- Why don't you go and find out?

355
00:22:37,908 --> 00:22:38,815
OK.

356
00:22:39,565 --> 00:22:41,080
I have my own mall.

357
00:22:44,412 --> 00:22:47,003
Ooh, very nice shoes.

358
00:22:47,628 --> 00:22:51,244
<i>(Clarisse) I'm glad you like it.
Try pressing button number three.</i>

359
00:22:51,244 --> 00:22:51,853
Oh.

360
00:22:57,603 --> 00:22:59,967
They're charming. I love these.

361
00:23:00,821 --> 00:23:02,571
What do you think? Grandma?

362
00:23:02,571 --> 00:23:03,882
I'm here.

363
00:23:04,915 --> 00:23:06,968
Oh, hello. Ooh, love that.

364
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:10,872
- This is...
- Now press combination 656.

365
00:23:11,446 --> 00:23:13,163
656.

366
00:23:18,948 --> 00:23:25,132
Um... They're a little... gorgeous.

367
00:23:25,132 --> 00:23:30,258
<i>(Clarisse) I had a selection
of the crown jewels brought out for you.</i>

368
00:23:30,258 --> 00:23:33,917
They're yours to borrow,
with great discretion, at appropriate times.

369
00:23:34,385 --> 00:23:37,899
Now for the best surprise of all.

370
00:23:42,133 --> 00:23:43,133
Wow.

371
00:23:44,921 --> 00:23:49,104
Gorgeous, Grandma. But kind of a letdown
after the jewels, I'm not gonna lie...

372
00:23:49,386 --> 00:23:50,195
<i>(screams)</i>

373
00:23:53,188 --> 00:23:56,373
<i>(squealing)</i>

374
00:23:56,373 --> 00:23:59,728
- You're here.
- I know I'm here.

375
00:24:00,009 --> 00:24:01,167
- You're in Genovia.
- I know.

376
00:24:01,405 --> 00:24:02,813
- You're in my closet.
- Yeah.

377
00:24:02,813 --> 00:24:04,329
- You're blonde.
- I'm blonde.

378
00:24:04,550 --> 00:24:05,862
I'm so glad to see you.

379
00:24:06,175 --> 00:24:08,755
I think this is
as good a moment as any to bow out.

380
00:24:08,755 --> 00:24:10,752
I think I'll let you two ladies
catch up with each other.

381
00:24:10,988 --> 00:24:13,143
<i>(Mia) I can't believe you're here.
When did your flight get in?</i>

382
00:24:13,401 --> 00:24:14,521
- Just a little while ago.
- Oh.

383
00:24:14,521 --> 00:24:16,948
By the way... I'm getting married.

384
00:24:17,177 --> 00:24:18,926
- To who?
- I don't know.

385
00:24:19,393 --> 00:24:22,319
<i>(Charlotte) Baron Johann Klimt.</i>

386
00:24:22,706 --> 00:24:24,886
<i>(Clarisse) No, not appropriate.
He's a compulsive gambler.</i>

387
00:24:25,254 --> 00:24:27,339
<i>(Mia gasps)</i>

388
00:24:27,949 --> 00:24:31,635
Yes. Oh, yes,
I, I, I, I absolutely accept.

389
00:24:32,364 --> 00:24:37,286
Prince William. He's not eligible,
because he's in line for his own crown.

390
00:24:37,553 --> 00:24:38,551
Oh.

391
00:24:38,785 --> 00:24:41,801
If he's not eligible,
why is he included in these pictures?

392
00:24:42,178 --> 00:24:45,925
- I just love to look at him.
- Mm. Me too. Mm-mm.

393
00:24:46,489 --> 00:24:48,082
- Your Majesty.
- Next.

394
00:24:48,356 --> 00:24:51,351
<i>- (Charlotte) Antoine Suisson of Paris.
- Uh-huh.</i>

395
00:24:51,351 --> 00:24:54,206
Plays the harp. No title, but good family.

396
00:24:54,206 --> 00:24:56,424
- What about the title "husband"?
- Yeah, he's cute.

397
00:24:56,638 --> 00:24:58,677
Mm. His boyfriend
thinks he's handsome also.

398
00:24:58,677 --> 00:24:59,753
Right on.

399
00:25:00,399 --> 00:25:03,802
No matter. Put him on
all the invitation lists. He's a divine dancer.

400
00:25:04,010 --> 00:25:04,884
<i>(Charlotte) Next.</i>

401
00:25:05,150 --> 00:25:06,337
<i>(Clarisse) Too old.</i>

402
00:25:06,614 --> 00:25:08,165
Too young.

403
00:25:08,791 --> 00:25:12,238
- Does this popcorn taste like pears?
- Mm. Genovian specialty.

404
00:25:12,238 --> 00:25:14,424
<i>- (Joe) Arrested too many times.
- Wait, no.</i>

405
00:25:14,639 --> 00:25:15,586
We need someone titled,

406
00:25:15,947 --> 00:25:20,764
someone who can help you run a country
without ego getting in the way.

407
00:25:20,993 --> 00:25:24,871
Someone attractive, smart,
but not arrogant.

408
00:25:25,403 --> 00:25:28,433
Someone with compassion.

409
00:25:28,649 --> 00:25:30,328
Someone like him?

410
00:25:30,558 --> 00:25:34,200
Yes. Someone very much like him.

411
00:25:34,449 --> 00:25:37,493
Good choice, Mia.
I wonder I didn't think of him before.

412
00:25:37,713 --> 00:25:40,266
- Andrew Jacoby.
- Duke of Kenilworth.

413
00:25:40,497 --> 00:25:41,247
Aw.

414
00:25:41,247 --> 00:25:43,591
Well, he looks... decent.

415
00:25:45,198 --> 00:25:49,631
<i>(Charlotte) He was an Olympic swimmer,
rides motorcycles, loves photography,</i>

416
00:25:49,884 --> 00:25:52,384
<i>and he's a pilot in the Royal Air Force.</i>

417
00:25:56,696 --> 00:25:58,352
- Can I do that?
- No.

418
00:25:59,653 --> 00:26:01,291
- You ever take those shades off?
- No.

419
00:26:02,109 --> 00:26:05,943
<i>(Elsie) Here we are
at the breezy seashore village of Mertz.</i>

420
00:26:06,605 --> 00:26:10,165
And our two lovers have perfect weather
for their first public outing.

421
00:26:10,478 --> 00:26:13,606
Along with Andrew's parents,
Susan and Arnold.

422
00:26:14,290 --> 00:26:17,125
Must be rather hard
to get to know each other this way.

423
00:26:17,448 --> 00:26:21,156
Oh, they're waving at us.

424
00:26:22,426 --> 00:26:24,451
- My... Oh.
- Oh, wait, wait, wait.

425
00:26:24,673 --> 00:26:27,343
Wait, Mia. A princess
should not run for a scarf.

426
00:26:27,647 --> 00:26:28,841
I got it.

427
00:26:29,637 --> 00:26:33,718
Shall we have some tea?

428
00:26:33,999 --> 00:26:36,239
- Your scarf, ma'am.
- Why, thank you, sir.

429
00:26:36,239 --> 00:26:38,561
I think you might be clumsier than me.

430
00:26:42,529 --> 00:26:43,562
Oh, good shot.

431
00:26:52,029 --> 00:26:52,779
Oh.

432
00:26:53,684 --> 00:26:55,067
No, no, let them bond. Let them bond.

433
00:26:55,067 --> 00:26:58,452
- The glasses. Off.
- I'm coming, Princess.

434
00:26:58,794 --> 00:27:00,751
- I'm coming, I'm coming, Princess.
- Oh, ow.

435
00:27:01,045 --> 00:27:02,293
Oh, there you go.

436
00:27:03,233 --> 00:27:03,982
Ah.

437
00:27:04,621 --> 00:27:05,482

Cool. You know, film.
That's nice. It's... What is that? Is that...

457
00:28:10,649 --> 00:28:13,066
It's a film canister.

458
00:28:13,285 --> 00:28:15,644
What's in the film canister? What's in it?

459
00:28:16,253 --> 00:28:18,814
- Why don't you open it? You'll see.

It was my great-grandmother's
engagement ring.

She and my great-grandfather
were married for 57 years.

So I...

464
00:28:32,879 --> 00:28:34,785
I felt it could be lucky for us, maybe.

465
00:28:35,662 --> 00:28:41,163

- No, I could do that.

- Exactly.

It was his dearest wish.

"Help him, Arthur.
One day he could be king. "

486
00:30:21,712 --> 00:30:24,269
I don't recall him
ever mentioning that to me.

Well, you wouldn't.
You were only six years old when he died.

But you do remember
who he named you after, don't you?

489
00:30:29,459 --> 00:30:30,737
Yes. Grandfather Nicholas.

490
00:30:31,003 --> 00:30:33,383
No, no, no, no. Niccolò Machiavelli.

00:31:34,504 --> 00:31:38,401
I'm sorry, is there something
you wanted to say to me?

508
00:31:39,004 --> 00:31:39,993
No, no.

509
00:31:40,252 --> 00:31:42,819
You are the one
who stomped on me with your big feet.

510
00:31:43,121 --> 00:31:44,463
Big feet?

511
00:31:45,223 --> 00:31:46,713
Brigitte, I found her.

512
00:31:47,276 --> 00:31:48,505
Uh, Brigitta.

513
00:31:48,848 --> 00:31:50,715
<i>(whispers) I'm not here.</i>

514
00:31:51,151 --> 00:31:54,347
It wasn't her. It was a ghost. Whoo...

515
00:31:54,746 --> 00:31:57,223
Well, you know,
you danced with my big feet.

516
00:31:57,442 --> 00:32:01,067
Fine. I danced with you. Call The Hague,
convene the war-crimes tribunal.

517
00:32:01,411 --> 00:32:04,070
Mia, I would remind you
that we only danced for about a minute.

518
00:32:04,502 --> 00:32:07,473
It was more than a minute.

519
00:32:07,879 --> 00:32:09,692
Well, maybe a minute and a half.

520
00:32:10,380 --> 00:32:14,591
Fine. It was a minute and a half,
but it was also a lie,

521
00:32:14,591 --> 00:32:17,914
because you didn't tell me who you were
and that you were trying to steal my crown.

522
00:32:18,122 --> 00:32:20,903
Please pardon me, I just had
a momentary lapse of good manners.

523
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:24,683
You see, usually, when I ask a woman
to dance, I always show her my family tree.

524
00:32:24,683 --> 00:32:26,570
Oh. Well, aren't you just...

525
00:32:27,318 --> 00:32:28,128
crafty.

526
00:32:28,128 --> 00:32:29,500
<i>- (Mrs. Kout) Let's look in the ballroom.
- (Brigitta) The ballroom?</i>

527
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:31,033
- I don't think she's in the ballroom.
- Well.

528
00:32:32,091 --> 00:32:33,586
Do you want to know
what else you were doing,

529
00:32:33,586 --> 00:32:35,117
while you were doing your little lie dance?

530
00:32:35,667 --> 00:32:36,975
<i>- Lie dance?
- (Brigitta) The ballroom?</i>

531
00:32:37,226 --> 00:32:38,759
- Yeah, that is exactly what you did.
- What is a lie dance?

532
00:32:39,011 --> 00:32:40,824
<i>(Mrs. Kout) I'll go look
in the ballroom myself.</i>

533
00:32:41,199 --> 00:32:42,290
<i>(Brigitta) All right.</i>

534
00:32:45,603 --> 00:32:48,229
The lie dance is not the point.

535
00:32:48,464 --> 00:32:50,314
- The point is that...
- What is the point?

536
00:32:50,564 --> 00:32:51,375
I...

537
00:32:51,792 --> 00:32:56,898
The point is that I'm onto you. Oh boy,
am I onto what you are trying to do.

538
00:32:56,898 --> 00:32:59,760
- And what am I trying to do?
- I think we both know exactly what that is.

539
00:32:59,978 --> 00:33:01,274
Oh, oh.

540
00:33:01,274 --> 00:33:03,791
Please forgive the intrusion,
Your Highness, Lord Devereaux.

541
00:33:03,791 --> 00:33:04,907
No, you don't... Uh...

542
00:33:07,057 --> 00:33:09,794
<i>(Joe) I'm told this Lord Devereaux boy
is a native Genovian.</i>

543
00:33:10,002 --> 00:33:12,200
Recently graduated Cambridge,
gourmet cook,

544
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:15,531
plays polo and rugby,
and is known as quite a ladies' man.

545
00:33:15,531 --> 00:33:20,116
- She was in a closet?
- With him. Yes.

546
00:33:20,567 --> 00:33:23,586
Does she have the makings of a queen?

547
00:33:23,941 --> 00:33:26,132
Well, she's young,
but I've always believed in her.

548
00:33:26,475 --> 00:33:28,442
The wedding invitations
have been sent out.

549
00:33:28,753 --> 00:33:31,254
- She and Andrew make a fine pair, I think.
- Yes, they do.

550
00:33:31,676 --> 00:33:33,440
She's very set on it, you know.

551
00:33:34,162 --> 00:33:36,722
Clarisse, my dear.
Forget the wedding for a moment.

00:33:40,348 --> 00:33:42,910
In less than a month,
you will no longer be queen,

554
00:33:42,910 --> 00:33:45,661
and I will no longer
be your head of security.

555
00:33:46,789 --> 00:33:50,505
I think it's time we bring
our friendship out of the shadows.

556
00:33:50,988 --> 00:33:54,029
- Oh, Joseph, I...
- Yes.

557
00:33:54,370 --> 00:33:57,382
Yes, my dear. I would kneel
if it weren't for my knee replacement.

558
00:33:57,838 --> 00:34:01,757
Joseph, there's a wedding to be planned.

559
00:34:02,098 --> 00:34:06,988
Mia needs to win over the people
of Genovia, all in less than 30 days.

560
00:34:07,208 --> 00:34:10,300
Perhaps it's time to consider
the duty you have to yourself.

561
00:34:12,340 --> 00:34:13,164
Oh.

562
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:14,506
Clarisse...

563
00:34:15,646 --> 00:34:19,285
My darling, please think about it. Please.

564
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:22,000
I will.

- What are we learning today?
- We are learning the art of the fan.

592
00:35:41,229 --> 00:35:42,010
- Fascinating.
- Yes.

593
00:35:42,444 --> 00:35:45,339
Get up. Get up. We only have about
ten minutes in which to communicate this.

594
00:35:45,339 --> 00:35:49,091
Now, first of all,
one handles a fan very deliberately.

595
00:35:49,091 --> 00:35:51,898
It's a tremendous
tool of communication. That's it.

596
00:35:52,184 --> 00:35:55,853

My job is to protect the crown,
to make sure no harm comes to the crown.

701

with the crown's emotions, you see.

702
00:42:15,779 --> 00:42:19,190
I think the entire country understands how
well you cater for the crown's emotions.

you will answer directly to me.

Of course, Your Majesty.

Why are you so against
Princess Mia being queen?

Well, my uncle feels that
Princess Mia doesn't know the people.

716
00:43:08,874 --> 00:43:11,533
And you feel you do know the people?

717
00:43:11,533 --> 00:43:14,146
Yes. I was born here,
I went to primary school here.

719
00:43:17,335 --> 00:43:19,291
Mia didn't even know
she was Genovian until high school,

720
00:43:19,291 --> 00:43:21,681
and to be frank,
she's spent little time here since then.

721
00:43:22,303 --> 00:43:26,084
Well, I happen to feel
that she'll make a great ruler.

722
00:43:26,990 --> 00:43:29,696
She's terribly bright, sensitive, caring.

Yes. Yes, I do. But...

of Princess Mia, riding in the 'Stang.</i>

843
00:50:52,740 --> 00:50:54,286
That was very nicely done, Miss Lilly.

844
00:50:54,990 --> 00:50:56,568
- It's a pleasure to meet you.
- Hi.

845
00:50:57,615 --> 00:51:00,087
The prettiest girl is riding in the 'Stang.

846
00:51:01,577 --> 00:51:02,844
- Flag?
- Thank you.

847
00:51:03,157 --> 00:51:04,317
Flag? Welcome.

848
00:51:04,703 --> 00:51:07,186
Welcome, Viscount Mabrey.
May I offer you a flag?

849
00:51:07,485 --> 00:51:09,359
Thank you, I am not a waving aficionado.

850
00:51:09,733 --> 00:51:13,408
But I will wave our national flag

851
00:51:13,752 --> 00:51:17,768
when a true Genovian king
once again sits on the throne.

852
00:51:18,625 --> 00:51:20,002
King Nicholas.

853
00:51:20,672 --> 00:51:22,249
Flag?

854
00:51:22,846 --> 00:51:24,438
How do you feel today, my dear?

855
00:51:24,657 --> 00:51:26,922
Honestly, Joe, not that great.

856
00:51:27,719 --> 00:51:29,898
Well, would you feel better
if you called me Joey?

857
00:51:30,564 --> 00:51:32,032
- No, Joe.
- Good.

858
00:51:32,471 --> 00:51:35,627
- Come on, Joseph. We're already late.
- Her Majesty is ready.

859
00:51:36,334 --> 00:51:39,374
Can't keep the people
of Genovia waiting any longer.

860
00:51:40,250 --> 00:51:42,785
Happy Independence Day, Genovia!

861
00:51:42,785 --> 00:51:46,344
Here we are in Pyrus, capital of Genovia,
for the big annual parade.

862
00:51:46,628 --> 00:51:47,836
Here they come.

863
00:51:49,565 --> 00:51:51,924
<i>(crowd sings Genovian national anthem)</i>

864

<i>(Elsie) People are coming
from all over Genovia.</i>

867

Here's the Mertz Marching Band,
led by Lucy Carmichael.

868
00:52:07,316 --> 00:52:10,704
And now, of course,
the Libbet's folk dancers.

869
00:52:11,651 --> 00:52:14,407
Also known as the "Leapers of Libbet. "

870
00:52:14,711 --> 00:52:18,098
And now the queen, with Princess Mia.

871
00:52:19,797 --> 00:52:24,411
<i>(boy) Na-na, I don't like your braids.</i>

872

<i>(boy #2) Hey, thumb-sucker.</i>

873
00:52:30,238 --> 00:52:31,489
Stop the carriage.

874
00:52:34,441 --> 00:52:38,034
What... what's going on? Mia?

875
00:52:38,330 --> 00:52:40,537
- She's stopped the parade.
- How rude.

876
00:52:41,253 --> 00:52:44,223
<i>(Elsie) Uh-oh.
What's the princess going to do now?</i>

877
00:52:44,845 --> 00:52:46,847
She's walking towards
the children's shelter.

878
00:52:47,098 --> 00:52:50,442
<i>- Hello, everybody.
- (all) Hello, Princess.</i>

879
00:52:54,242 --> 00:52:55,977
Hello. What's your name?

880
00:52:56,351 --> 00:52:57,181
Carolina.

881
00:52:58,010 --> 00:52:59,322
And what are your names?

882
00:52:59,727 --> 00:53:00,791
- John.
- Blake.

883
00:53:00,791 --> 00:53:02,510
Did I see you messing with Carolina?

884
00:53:03,136 --> 00:53:04,554
They were tugging on my braid.

885
00:53:07,761 --> 00:53:09,384
Excuse me. These children are?

886
00:53:10,242 --> 00:53:14,616
Most of them are orphans.
We care for as many as possible.

887
00:53:17,781 --> 00:53:20,618
Kissing children. Hugging orphans.

888
00:53:21,043 --> 00:53:24,493
What a vulgar, low,
despicable, political trick.

889
00:53:26,324 --> 00:53:27,071
Carolina.

890
00:53:27,821 --> 00:53:29,570
Would you like to be a princess today?

891
00:53:29,974 --> 00:53:32,441
<i>I can't, I'm too little. Too piccola.</i>

892
00:53:32,752 --> 00:53:37,285
Oh, no. Because I declare
that anyone can be a princess today.

893
00:53:38,066 --> 00:53:39,973
Well, why don't we get you a tiara,

894
00:53:40,534 --> 00:53:42,409
and you can wave,
and march in the parade?

895
00:53:42,409 --> 00:53:44,182
In fact, why don't you all take tiaras?

896
00:53:44,877 --> 00:53:47,408
All? Give them all free tiaras?

897
00:53:47,408 --> 00:53:49,285
- I'll take care of it later.
- Thank you.

898
00:53:49,710 --> 00:53:51,192
<i>- (girl) Yo quiero una verde.
- (girl #2) I want a silver one.</i>

899
00:53:57,127 --> 00:53:58,925
You won't be able to wave
with your thumb in your mouth.

900
00:53:59,533 --> 00:54:01,941
- I can wave with this hand.
- Very good.

901
00:54:04,105 --> 00:54:05,574
<i>- (girl) I want the purple one.
- (boy) I want a crown.</i>

902
00:54:05,574 --> 00:54:07,191
<i>- (boy #2) Can we be in the parade?
- Of course, of course.</i>

903
00:54:07,191 --> 00:54:09,113
We could always use
more princes in the world.

904
00:54:09,885 --> 00:54:11,677
OK, so...

905
00:54:12,928 --> 00:54:17,456
To be a princess, you have
to believe that you are a princess.

906
00:54:17,865 --> 00:54:21,272
You've got to walk
the way you think a princess would walk.

907
00:54:21,272 --> 00:54:25,449
So think tall, you gotta smile,
and wave, and just have fun.

908
00:54:25,785 --> 00:54:26,800
- So are you ready?
- Yes.

909
00:54:28,644 --> 00:54:30,894
Ah, she's letting the children join her.
How charming.

910
00:54:31,692 --> 00:54:32,677
Not for everyone.

911
00:54:33,574 --> 00:54:34,822
Drumroll, please.

912
00:54:35,268 --> 00:54:36,955

at the best Independence Day
parade Genovia's seen in years.

931
00:55:32,251 --> 00:55:34,564
Thanks to Princess Mia's special surprise.

932
00:55:34,824 --> 00:55:37,294
May the rest of your day be sunny-side up.

<i>(Mia) And so, gentlemen,
the children from the shelter</i>

934
00:55:41,888 --> 00:55:44,449
will be housed at the winter castle
in the mountains of Libbet.

935
00:55:44,449 --> 00:55:48,420
The use of the castle as a resort

936
00:55:48,784 --> 00:55:52,170
is sort of a perk
for parliament members and dignitaries.

937
00:55:52,386 --> 00:55:53,326
- Exactly.
- Oh.

938
00:55:54,253 --> 00:55:57,559
Well, I'm going to de-perk it,
and convert it into a children's shelter

939
00:55:57,559 --> 00:55:59,575
until money can be raised
for one of their own.

940
00:56:00,264 --> 00:56:02,763
I feel guilty
having two homes while they have none.

Lord Crawley, how is your brother doing?

943
00:56:06,560 --> 00:56:08,614
- I don't speak to my brother.
- Oh.

944
00:56:08,924 --> 00:56:10,934
Well, I've hired him
to be the architect on the project.

945
00:56:10,934 --> 00:56:14,903
- Mr. Crawley.
- Your Highness.

946

Well, I look forward

But no one else's.

950
00:56:24,146 --> 00:56:26,425
- Oh, I'll give you notes, because I'm part...
- Oh, no, you won't. I'm an architect.

951
00:56:26,425 --> 00:56:28,591
- I am part of this parliament.
- Oh, you just go skiing...

952
00:56:28,591 --> 00:56:30,396
- So what if I go skiing?
... and you like to be an outdoorsman.

953
00:56:30,396 --> 00:56:32,146
- Oh, and you're a couch potato.
- Outdoorsman.

00:56:32,146 --> 00:56:33,765
- You're a couch potato.
- Outdoorsman.

The queen approves of the plan,
and I intend to see it through.

958

Now, gentlemen, I don't think it'll take
too long to raise the money. Do you?

959
00:56:45,590 --> 00:56:47,936
We're setting up
the ramp in the ballroom.

960
00:56:48,310 --> 00:56:48,767
OK.

00:56:49,967 --> 00:56:50,995
- Hello.
- Hello.

962
00:56:50,995 --> 00:56:53,059
My hello's insignificant.

963
00:56:53,059 --> 00:56:55,686

964
00:56:56,894 --> 00:56:57,644
So.

965
00:57:00,737 --> 00:57:03,424
- Are you crashing my bridal shower?
- Sadly, no.

966
00:57:03,903 --> 00:57:07,717
I wanted to tell you that I was very
impressed by what you did at the parade.

01:09:41,507 --> 01:09:44,476
No, Joseph.
You had to know what I was going to say.

1181
01:09:44,476 --> 01:09:47,350
Mia needs me now more than ever before.

1182
01:09:47,632 --> 01:09:50,215
It's the monarchy. I mean,
as queen it's my responsibility.

1183
01:09:50,692 --> 01:09:51,967
You know how it is.

1184
01:09:51,967 --> 01:09:54,351
You were never just my queen, Clarisse.

1185
01:09:54,351 --> 01:09:57,194
You were the someone that I wanted
to spend the rest of my life with.

1186
01:09:58,369 --> 01:10:03,038
But, if you prefer that I see you
first and foremost as my queen...

1187
01:10:04,693 --> 01:10:05,896
- I shall oblige.
- No, Joseph...

1188
01:10:06,758 --> 01:10:08,007
Your Majesty.

If you don't need anything else, Princess,
we're going to supper.

1192
01:10:34,746 --> 01:10:35,997
Oh. Well, enjoy yourselves, ladies.

1193
01:10:36,216 --> 01:10:38,464
Ah-ah-ah. What did we talk about?

1194
01:10:38,801 --> 01:10:40,184
No more curtsy.

1195
01:10:40,799 --> 01:10:42,017
We're going to supper.

1196
01:10:42,341 --> 01:10:43,985
Thank you.

1197
01:10:45,465 --> 01:10:46,986
- Hi, Miss Lilly.
- May we announce you?

1198
01:10:46,986 --> 01:10:48,717
I can announce myself. Lilly Moscovitz!

1199
01:10:48,717 --> 01:10:50,676
- Mia, look out your window.
- Why? What's going on?

1200
01:10:50,676 --> 01:10:53,558
Just look out your window.
Prince Charming is throwing pebbles.

1201
01:10:54,642 --> 01:10:55,722
Nicholas.

1202
01:11:00,892 --> 01:11:02,124
Nicholas, what are you doing?

1203
01:11:03,266 --> 01:11:03,701
<i>(clears throat)</i>

1204
01:11:04,340 --> 01:11:07,906
Rapunzel, Rapunzel, with hair so fine.

1205
01:11:08,156 --> 01:11:10,749
Come out your window,
climb down the vine.

1206
01:11:13,902 --> 01:11:16,518
The feat you ask, dear sir, isn't easy.

1207
01:11:16,518 --> 01:11:19,114
And I won't respond
to that line, it's far too cheesy.

1208
01:11:20,035 --> 01:11:20,535
So what does he want?

1209
01:11:21,118 --> 01:11:23,395
He wants me to climb down the vine.

1210
01:11:23,876 --> 01:11:24,910
- Well, do you want to?
- Yes.

1211
01:11:25,743 --> 01:11:28,208
- So go.
- It's a recipe for disaster.

1212
01:11:28,208 --> 01:11:31,711
Mia, do something impulsive
for once in your life. You're getting married.

1213
01:11:31,711 --> 01:11:35,152
Do you want a regular bachelorette party
with 12 screaming girls,

1214
01:11:35,152 --> 01:11:39,349
or do you want a stroll in the moonlight
with your almost-Prince Charming?

1215
01:12:00,430 --> 01:12:02,693
I always like a man in shades.

1216
01:12:03,722 --> 01:12:06,036
- Oh, Your Majesty.
- No, no, ladies.

1217
01:12:06,036 --> 01:12:08,470
Come in, come in.
I was just about to leave.

1218
01:12:09,158 --> 01:12:10,673
This really is more romantic in books.

1219
01:12:11,537 --> 01:12:12,931
My foot is stuck.

1224
01:12:25,972 --> 01:12:29,722
Your Majesty, we never got to finish
our routine at the slumber party.

1225
01:12:29,722 --> 01:12:31,160
And there's more dancing, too.

1226
01:12:31,472 --> 01:12:33,816

1227
01:12:33,816 --> 01:12:36,022

1228
01:12:36,348 --> 01:12:38,745

- Yes, the big finale.

- I'm sorry. Did I hurt you again?
- No, I... I'm used to it.

01:12:56,285 --> 01:12:59,975
What a pity we missed it at the party.

<i>(Lilly) I'll cover for you. Go, Rapunzel, go.</i>

<i>- (Nicholas) Tell me your greatest desires.
- Tell me a secret.</i>

- Isn't that the same?
- Almost.

1239
01:13:23,151 --> 01:13:24,941
But anyone can see your desires.

1240
01:13:25,622 --> 01:13:26,910
No one knows what's in your heart.

1241
01:13:27,692 --> 01:13:29,786
- Tell me something.
- Um...

1242
01:13:31,192 --> 01:13:35,008
<i>I love I Love Lucy reruns.
And sometimes I dream in black and white.</i>

1243
01:13:35,317 --> 01:13:38,849
I used to pretend I was sick
when I had a test in school.

1244
01:13:39,403 --> 01:13:41,693
- We all did that.
- OK.

1245
01:13:42,992 --> 01:13:45,411
Sometimes, I put chocolate milk
on my cereal.

1246
01:13:46,630 --> 01:13:49,714
I am deathly afraid of jellyfish.

1247
01:13:50,819 --> 01:13:52,632
I haven't danced with you
since your birthday.

1248
01:13:53,653 --> 01:13:55,239
That's a fact. It's not a secret.

1249
01:13:56,320 --> 01:13:57,509
The secret is, is that...

01:13:58,600 --> 01:13:59,602

- Hello.

- We stayed out all night.
- Yes, we did.

1267

We stayed out all night.

1268
01:15:11,844 --> 01:15:13,044
Is that...

1269
01:15:17,127 --> 01:15:19,180
- There's a man in that boat.
- What?

1270
01:15:19,454 --> 01:15:21,628
Do you see that?
There's somebody over there.

1271
01:15:22,298 --> 01:15:25,400
He's probably some fisherman, I suppose.

1272
01:15:33,742 --> 01:15:35,422
With a video camera?

1273
01:15:36,220 --> 01:15:37,910
- What?
- You're really low.

1274
01:15:38,381 --> 01:15:40,320
No, Mia.
I have no idea who that man is.

1275
01:15:40,600 --> 01:15:43,224
You know, it's really a shame he didn't
get juicier stuff last night, you jerk.

1276
01:15:43,432 --> 01:15:45,839
Mia, I have nothing to do with this. I swear.

1277
01:15:45,839 --> 01:15:48,715
Mia, please. Come on.
Will you listen to me?

1278
01:15:48,715 --> 01:15:51,285
- That is not my boat.
- Hey, Nicholas? Have a nice life.

1279
01:15:51,285 --> 01:15:53,319
But that is my horse. Mia...

Mia? Hello?

1281
01:16:01,996 --> 01:16:03,161
Good morning, my love.

1282
01:16:04,349 --> 01:16:07,277
I know it's a little early,
but I've been thinking.

1283
01:16:08,590 --> 01:16:10,974
Things have been so pressured lately.

1284
01:16:11,271 --> 01:16:13,089
I was wondering
whether we should spend...

1285
01:16:15,369 --> 01:16:16,787
Lilly?

1286
01:16:17,039 --> 01:16:18,745
Good morning, Your Majesty.

Doors.

01:16:27,098 --> 01:16:29,884

- Princess, I think you should see this.

01:16:49,663 --> 01:16:52,072
<i>Or will Lord Nicholas Devereaux
be the new king?</i>

1298
01:16:52,374 --> 01:16:55,896
<i>It's out of the frying pan
and into the fire for Princess Mia.</i>

<i>Keep your eggs sunny-side up.</i>

1300
01:16:58,507 --> 01:17:00,508
I'd like to tell her
what she can do with her eggs...

1301
01:17:00,777 --> 01:17:01,402
Lilly.

1302
01:17:01,402 --> 01:17:03,883
- Could we have a moment alone?
- Yes.

1303
01:17:13,352 --> 01:17:14,102
So?

1304
01:17:19,085 --> 01:17:20,820
I got played.

1305
01:17:23,809 --> 01:17:25,290
A-ha.

1306
01:17:26,743 --> 01:17:29,413
Well, the big question is:

1307
01:17:29,687 --> 01:17:31,155
Do we still have a wedding?

1308
01:17:33,290 --> 01:17:36,416
- Andrew, I am so, so sorry.
- Excuse me.

1309
01:17:36,416 --> 01:17:39,288
Andrew, please wait.
I promise you nothing happened.

1310
01:17:39,538 --> 01:17:41,446
Yes, but Mia,
you still went, didn't you? You went.

1311
01:17:42,194 --> 01:17:45,570
I don't think you understand. I'm an
extremely eligible bachelor in England.

1312
01:17:45,788 --> 01:17:49,633
I really am. I've got plenty of friends,
lots of lovely women friends, and...

1313
01:17:50,560 --> 01:17:53,635
I still think this marriage is a good idea.

1314
01:17:55,510 --> 01:17:56,416

Ah.

1318
01:18:12,899 --> 01:18:13,697
So?

1319
01:18:14,729 --> 01:18:15,560
Anything?

1320
01:18:16,072 --> 01:18:19,024
I really want to say yes, but no.
There's just, there's no...

1322
01:18:22,012 --> 01:18:22,624
Me too.

1323
01:18:23,635 --> 01:18:25,696
- Really?
- Really.

1324
01:18:26,685 --> 01:18:28,479
- I mean, it was pleasurable.
- Very.

1325
01:18:28,479 --> 01:18:30,322
- Very pleasant, but, but, but no fireworks.
- None.

1326
01:18:32,423 --> 01:18:34,328
What are we gonna do? Look, we will...

1327
01:18:35,706 --> 01:18:36,706
We will figure something out.

1328
01:18:38,579 --> 01:18:39,579
Mia.

1329
01:18:48,049 --> 01:18:49,988
You chose me.

1330
01:18:56,696 --> 01:18:57,706
No privacy.

1331
01:19:01,832 --> 01:19:03,770
You chose me, and I accepted.

1332
01:19:04,788 --> 01:19:07,020
And a gentleman
never backs out on his word.

1333
01:19:07,548 --> 01:19:08,580
We are going to...

1334
01:19:09,142 --> 01:19:12,989
We're going to stand up in church and say
"I do," and tomorrow we'll be man and wife.

1335
01:19:14,488 --> 01:19:18,174
And you are going to make
an amazing queen of Genovia.

1336
01:19:21,853 --> 01:19:23,143
Thank you.

1337
01:19:37,793 --> 01:19:39,377

Your Highness, we're running very late.

1340
01:19:53,635 --> 01:19:58,138
Grandma says the queen is never late,
everyone else is simply early.

1341
01:19:58,479 --> 01:20:00,357
Your Highness, a strange woman came in

1342
01:20:00,357 --> 01:20:02,233
and said that she wanted
to hide in your closet.

1343
01:20:02,512 --> 01:20:03,439
So I let her.

1344
01:20:05,198 --> 01:20:08,202
Well, dear, that probably
wasn't the wisest decision in the...

1345
01:20:08,719 --> 01:20:10,858
Now, this is what I call a closet.

1346
01:20:10,858 --> 01:20:13,183
- Mom.
- Oh, my darling.

1347
01:20:14,292 --> 01:20:16,107
- Careful. We're squashing Trevor.
- Hi.

1348
01:20:16,107 --> 01:20:17,535
Hi, Trevor.

1349
01:20:18,361 --> 01:20:20,036
He's sleeping. Shh.

1350
01:20:20,331 --> 01:20:24,411
He is the most beautiful baby brother.

1351
01:20:25,422 --> 01:20:28,894
We were joking.
We knew it was your mother.

1352
01:20:29,125 --> 01:20:30,392
Your stepfather's here too.

1353
01:20:31,533 --> 01:20:34,579
Now, I'm your mother, it's your
wedding day, I have to say something.

1354
01:20:35,175 --> 01:20:38,953
Being married is about being yourself,
only with someone else.

1355
01:20:40,750 --> 01:20:42,378
Thanks, Mom.

1356
01:20:42,378 --> 01:20:43,019
<i>(knocking)</i>

1357
01:20:43,516 --> 01:20:45,110
- How are you feeling? You look beautiful.
- I'm... Well, I'm...

1358
01:20:45,330 --> 01:20:46,143
- You look so calm.
- I'm a little...

1359
01:20:46,395 --> 01:20:49,833
Paolo is back to turn
a caterpillar into a butterfly.

1360
01:20:50,219 --> 01:20:52,907
- There she go, butterfly.
- Paolo.

1361
01:20:53,157 --> 01:20:55,282
Coat off. I tell you, when I say
"butterfly," the coat comes off.

1362
01:20:55,628 --> 01:20:56,909
<i>- Principessa Mia.
- Paolo.</i>

1363
01:20:58,001 --> 01:20:59,851
<i>- You remember my mother, Helen.
- Piacere.</i>

1364
01:21:00,191 --> 01:21:02,093
<i>- The hairdresser.
- And a new baby. Monella.</i>

1365
01:21:02,093 --> 01:21:03,564
All Italian men love baby - except Paolo.

1366
01:21:03,564 --> 01:21:06,020
You got to get out now,
because we have to go to work.

1367
01:21:07,438 --> 01:21:09,911
Five years ago,
Paolo take you from that to that.

1368
01:21:10,881 --> 01:21:13,801
Today, he give you this.

1369
01:21:14,204 --> 01:21:15,503
A wedding look for the bride.

1370
01:21:18,928 --> 01:21:21,674
I look like a moose.

1371
01:21:22,676 --> 01:21:25,895
Yes, but a very cute moose.
Make all the boy moose go...

1372
01:21:26,115 --> 01:21:27,084
<i>(honks)</i>

1373
01:21:28,410 --> 01:21:29,503
I have antlers.

1374
01:21:29,503 --> 01:21:30,736
<i>(honks)</i>

1375
01:21:32,802 --> 01:21:33,565
Go.

1376
01:21:38,322 --> 01:21:39,256
I look like a poodle.

1377
01:21:39,934 --> 01:21:43,383
That's just the way I feel.
Here we go again.

1378
01:21:44,603 --> 01:21:45,851
Good. Sit up.

1379
01:21:46,068 --> 01:21:47,228
She kind of does look like a poodle.

1380
01:21:50,105 --> 01:21:51,082
I like it.

1381
01:21:54,586 --> 01:21:56,992
This time I'm so sure,
I use my own pictures.

1382
01:21:57,795 --> 01:22:00,648
<i>So. Un, deux, trois.</i>

1383
01:22:01,554 --> 01:22:04,039
<i>(Mabrey) Gretchen?
I can't find my gloves.</i>

1384
01:22:05,115 --> 01:22:09,149
You go on. I think it would be better
if I didn't go to the wedding.

1385
01:22:09,931 --> 01:22:10,930
My boy.

1386
01:22:12,108 --> 01:22:15,241
Don't give up so easily.
Come to church. Sweep her off her feet.

1387
01:22:15,920 --> 01:22:17,305
In a week or two, she'll be yours.

1388
01:22:18,078 --> 01:22:20,962
The game is over, Uncle.
She's going to marry Andrew.

1389
01:22:21,401 --> 01:22:23,149
Ah, you're so right. Ah, well.

1390
01:22:23,650 --> 01:22:26,541
This is a disaster in the making.
Wouldn't miss a moment of it.

1391
01:22:27,387 --> 01:22:31,232
I'll try to catch the garter.

1392
01:22:32,428 --> 01:22:34,367
<i>(shouts) The royal carriage approaches.</i>

1393
01:22:34,883 --> 01:22:36,899
- What did he say, Artie?
- The princess is coming.

1394
01:22:36,899 --> 01:22:37,920
Showtime.

1395
01:22:40,351 --> 01:22:42,357
Suki Sanchez here from the USA.

1396
01:22:42,679 --> 01:22:45,542
A long way from home,
but happily following a story

1397
01:22:45,542 --> 01:22:47,570
that started in the streets
of San Francisco,

1398
01:22:47,805 --> 01:22:52,013
and is about to have a happy ending here
in the small, beautiful land of Genovia.

1399
01:22:53,327 --> 01:22:55,525
Prepare for the arrival of Princess Mia.

1400
01:23:01,482 --> 01:23:03,295
Psst. Sir.

1401
01:23:04,492 --> 01:23:07,086
I don't mean to talk out of school,
but there's something you must know.

1402
01:23:10,150 --> 01:23:13,168
Your uncle called Elsie
and set you up with that video.

1403
01:23:13,710 --> 01:23:17,368
Why doesn't that surprise me?
I should have known.

1404
01:23:17,762 --> 01:23:19,204
He's up to something.

1405
01:23:19,204 --> 01:23:22,214
He was much too delighted
that you aren't going to that wedding.

1406
01:23:22,461 --> 01:23:24,431
- I must get to that church.
- Yes, yes, but how?

1407
01:23:24,921 --> 01:23:28,078
Everything on four wheels
is already rented for the wedding.

1408
01:23:28,078 --> 01:23:30,150
- Doesn't matter, I'll run.
- No, no. It's too far.

1409
01:23:30,401 --> 01:23:32,872
No, no. You'll take the bike.

1410
01:23:33,668 --> 01:23:35,870
The bike? Gretchen, what bike?
We don't have a bike.

1411
01:23:35,870 --> 01:23:36,993
Your grandfather's bike.

1412
01:23:44,277 --> 01:23:49,234
<i>- Buenas tardes, Tanya.
- Buenas tardes, su Majestad.</i>

1413
01:23:49,234 --> 01:23:52,485
<i>Aquí le presento a mi tío,
que nos visita de Rosario.</i>

1414
01:23:52,485 --> 01:23:56,275
- Oh, how do you do, señor?
- I do better if you and I get married.

1415
01:23:56,275 --> 01:24:02,765
I'm sorry. My uncle learned his English
watching the old Three Stooges movies.

1416
01:24:03,121 --> 01:24:04,111
Sorry.

1417
01:24:08,462 --> 01:24:09,060
Yes, well...

1418
01:24:12,902 --> 01:24:14,299
You're not going to believe this.

1419
01:24:14,716 --> 01:24:17,206
Lord Devereaux's riding
up the road on a bicycle.

1420
01:24:17,548 --> 01:24:18,549
<i>(Nicholas) Sir!</i>

1421
01:24:18,870 --> 01:24:20,517
Sir, may I borrow your horse?

1422
01:24:20,517 --> 01:24:21,809
Oh, he needs my horse.

1423
01:24:22,748 --> 01:24:24,201
<i>(Nicholas) My bike is yours.</i>

1424
01:24:25,183 --> 01:24:28,058
How am I supposed
to herd sheep with a bike?

1425
01:24:47,370 --> 01:24:50,684
Outspoken American activist
Lilly Moscovitz, the maid of honor,

1426
01:24:50,684 --> 01:24:53,611
glides forward as a vision in pink.

1427
01:24:54,560 --> 01:24:57,213
I'm a girl who loves black
and is wearing pink.

1428
01:24:58,936 --> 01:25:00,967
<i>(all) Aww.</i>

1429
01:25:01,279 --> 01:25:04,078
<i>(Elsie) And Duke Andrew's

affectionately known
as "James of the Cherub Cheeks,"

1431
01:25:07,874 --> 01:25:11,074
comes down the aisle
as the royal ring bearer.

1432
01:25:13,904 --> 01:25:15,404
- Hey, Joe.
- Hm?

1433
01:25:15,832 --> 01:25:18,950
I just wanted to say, before I do this...

1434
01:25:20,045 --> 01:25:22,028
I'm sorry you're retiring.

1435
01:25:23,126 --> 01:25:26,155
- Who told you that?
- The maids know everything.

1436
01:25:29,153 --> 01:25:32,872
Well, the heart does things
for reasons that reason cannot understand.

1437
01:25:34,643 --> 01:25:36,654
You're preaching to the choir.

1438
01:25:37,893 --> 01:25:38,465
<i>(knocks)</i>

1439
01:25:39,074 --> 01:25:41,435
Princess?

1440
01:25:41,657 --> 01:25:42,311
Yes?

1441
01:25:42,965 --> 01:25:47,268
And you should know
that Nicholas did not set you up at the lake.

1442
01:25:49,029 --> 01:25:54,561
- Are you sure?
- The maids know everything.

1443
01:25:56,782 --> 01:25:58,030
We're ready when she is.

1444
01:25:59,936 --> 01:26:03,062

<i>(music falters and halts)</i>

1447
01:27:00,032 --> 01:27:01,375
- Is this part of the plan?
- No.

1448
01:27:02,675 --> 01:27:03,239
I...

<i>(clears throat)</i>

1450
01:27:06,242 --> 01:27:08,329
I'm going to need a minute or two.

1451
01:27:10,093 --> 01:27:12,095
Thank you, Your Highness.

1452
01:27:14,932 --> 01:27:18,117
<i>(Elsie) Now the bride is moving
swiftly back up the aisle and out the door.</i>

1453
01:27:18,598 --> 01:27:20,524
<i>- Let me.
- (Elsie) Not the traditional route.</i>

1454
01:27:21,773 --> 01:27:24,555
<i>(woman) Princess Mia!</i>

1455
01:27:24,790 --> 01:27:26,526
- Princess Mia!
- Mia!

1456
01:27:30,714 --> 01:27:33,484
- Helen.
- Honey, I'll be right back.

1457
01:27:33,484 --> 01:27:34,994
I gotta change Trevor's diaper.

1458
01:27:35,369 --> 01:27:40,056
Please, be seated. There'll just be
a momentary interlude. Thank you.

1459
01:27:40,464 --> 01:27:44,400
- Do we rush after her?
- No, we never rush. We hasten.

1460
01:27:44,651 --> 01:27:47,648
- You'll take care of this?
- Yes, yes. Yes, just one moment.

<i>(Clarisse) Out of my way.</i>

Oh, my dear. Mia.

1463
01:28:01,900 --> 01:28:03,715
Oh, Grandma, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

1464
01:28:03,715 --> 01:28:05,579
- I... I just need a minute.
- No.

1465
01:28:05,579 --> 01:28:06,777
- I can do this.
- No.

1466
01:28:07,266 --> 01:28:08,321
- I can't do this.
- I know.

1467
01:28:08,703 --> 01:28:13,216
Darling, listen to me.

1468
01:28:13,424 --> 01:28:15,387
I made my choice.

1469
01:28:15,981 --> 01:28:19,018
Duty to my country over love.

1470
01:28:19,611 --> 01:28:22,996
It's what I've always done, it seems.
It was drummed into me my whole life.

1471
01:28:23,854 --> 01:28:27,150
Now I've lost
the only man I ever really loved.

1472
01:28:29,775 --> 01:28:32,558
<i>- (radio) Anyone got a 20 on Joseph?
- I'm with the eagle and sparrow.</i>

1473
01:28:33,307 --> 01:28:36,278
Mia, I want you to make
your choices as a woman.

1474
01:28:36,278 --> 01:28:38,276
Don't make the same mistakes I did.

1475
01:28:38,276 --> 01:28:41,025
Make your own mistakes.
There'll be plenty of them, believe me.

1476
01:28:41,248 --> 01:28:44,737
Now, you can go back into that church
and get married, or you can walk away.

1477
01:28:45,175 --> 01:28:46,840
Whatever choice you make,

1478
01:28:47,808 --> 01:28:49,465
let it come from your heart.

1479
01:28:57,684 --> 01:29:00,113
- Excuse me.
- She's back.

<i>(Elsie) The princess

She's walking down the aisle.

1482
01:29:09,793 --> 01:29:11,466
More like cantering down the aisle.

01:29:22,373 --> 01:29:23,466
Andrew, wait.

Everyone deserves the chance
to find true love, right?

1486
01:29:28,966 --> 01:29:29,527
Yes.

1487
01:29:30,373 --> 01:29:31,644
Including us?

1488
01:29:33,438 --> 01:29:34,638
Thank you.

1489
01:29:40,613 --> 01:29:41,893
For, for, uh...

1490
01:29:42,581 --> 01:29:45,709
saving me from doing
the proper thing for once in my life.

1491
01:29:48,151 --> 01:29:49,998
Now all I have to do is tell Mummy.

1492
01:29:51,373 --> 01:29:52,998
I have to tell everyone else.

1493
01:29:53,925 --> 01:29:54,750
<i>(both) Good luck.</i>

1494
01:30:00,205 --> 01:30:01,832
Helen.

1495
01:30:06,168 --> 01:30:08,428
Welcome.

1496
01:30:10,476 --> 01:30:14,740
A few moments ago, I realized
the only reason I was getting married

1497
01:30:14,740 --> 01:30:18,146
was because of a law, and that
didn't seem like a good enough reason.

1498
01:30:18,740 --> 01:30:19,509
So...

1499
01:30:20,350 --> 01:30:22,003
I won't be getting married today.

1500
01:30:23,488 --> 01:30:25,257
Sit. Sit. There may be a dinner.

1501
01:30:28,739 --> 01:30:32,568
My grandmother has ruled without a man
at her side for quite some time, and...

1502
01:30:33,426 --> 01:30:35,106
I think she rocks at it.

1503
01:30:37,144 --> 01:30:40,364
So as the granddaughter
of Queen Clarisse and King Rupert...

1504
01:30:40,364 --> 01:30:43,021
<i>(all) King Rupert. May he rest in peace.</i>

1505
01:30:44,082 --> 01:30:48,037
I ask the members of parliament
to think about your daughters,

1506
01:30:49,449 --> 01:30:53,005
your nieces, and sisters,
and granddaughters,

1507
01:30:53,005 --> 01:30:54,147
and ask yourselves:

1508
01:30:56,273 --> 01:30:59,535
Would you force them to do
what you're trying to make me do?

1509
01:31:03,146 --> 01:31:06,144
I believe I will be a great queen.

1510
01:31:06,849 --> 01:31:10,572
<i>I understand Genovia to be a land
that combines the beauty of the past</i>

1511
01:31:11,357 --> 01:31:13,448
<i>with all the best hope of the future.</i>

1512
01:31:13,448 --> 01:31:14,840
- Not now.
- Shh.

1513
01:31:15,485 --> 01:31:19,528
I feel in my heart and soul
that I can rule Genovia.

1514
01:31:19,810 --> 01:31:21,511
I... I love Genovia.

1515
01:31:22,640 --> 01:31:25,248
Do you think that I would
be up here in a wedding dress if I didn't?

1516
01:31:27,651 --> 01:31:28,651
I stand here,

1517
01:31:29,826 --> 01:31:33,236
ready to take my place as your queen.

1518
01:31:34,433 --> 01:31:37,200
Without a husband.

1519
01:31:37,873 --> 01:31:40,777
<i>(woman) Viva Mia!</i>

1520
01:31:47,029 --> 01:31:48,278
Every time...

1521
01:31:49,360 --> 01:31:53,779
Every time this charming
young lady opens her mouth,

1522
01:31:54,208 --> 01:31:58,893
she demonstrates a contempt
for the customs of Genovia.

1523
01:31:59,747 --> 01:32:05,732
The law clearly states
an unmarried woman cannot be queen.

1524
01:32:06,766 --> 01:32:07,715
Fortunately,

1525
01:32:09,217 --> 01:32:11,575
there is another heir.

1526
01:32:11,875 --> 01:32:13,090
No, there is not.

1527
01:32:15,438 --> 01:32:18,079
I decline. I refuse to be king.

1528
01:32:19,825 --> 01:32:23,375
Ladies and gentlemen, it is Princess Mia
who should have the crown.

1529
01:32:24,404 --> 01:32:26,717
She's bright, and she is caring.

1530
01:32:27,356 --> 01:32:29,434
But more importantly, she has a vision.

1531
01:32:30,123 --> 01:32:33,425
One that will take Genovia forward,
and if the parliament were astute,

1532
01:32:34,645 --> 01:32:36,027
they would name her queen.

1533
01:32:36,763 --> 01:32:40,146
Listen to her.
She'll lead us into the 21st century.

1534
01:32:41,250 --> 01:32:45,860
And besides, just think how lovely
she'll look on our postage stamp.

1535
01:32:47,835 --> 01:32:50,000
Lovely on a postage stamp?

1536
01:32:50,623 --> 01:32:52,903
You would look lovely on a postage stamp!

1537
01:32:52,903 --> 01:32:56,552
Don't you walk away from me, sir!
You have a duty, sir, to Genovia.

1538
01:32:56,957 --> 01:33:01,563
He's, uh... he is very distressed.

1539
01:33:01,800 --> 01:33:03,959
Your duty, sir, to the country! To me, sir!

1540
01:33:06,217 --> 01:33:09,593
To Genovia! For your father! Nicholas!

1541
01:33:10,083 --> 01:33:12,440
- The door.
- Shut the doors, quickly.

1542
01:33:14,094 --> 01:33:15,147
Nicholas. Nicholas!

1543
01:33:15,803 --> 01:33:19,029
Nicholas, I cannot have you
giving all, all this up just for a girl.

1544
01:33:19,029 --> 01:33:21,154
- Now, look, we can still...
- Enough, Uncle.

1545
01:33:22,438 --> 01:33:23,312
We're finished.

1546
01:33:26,125 --> 01:33:27,452
What is happening here?

1547
01:33:27,908 --> 01:33:30,360
Who's next in line for the throne?
The Von Trokens?

1548
01:33:30,360 --> 01:33:31,712
We accept.

1549
01:33:31,712 --> 01:33:33,844
Sit down.

1550
01:33:37,689 --> 01:33:39,218
<i>(coughs) Make a motion.</i>

1551
01:33:39,501 --> 01:33:41,936
<i>- Are you OK? Do you need a...
- (coughs) Make a motion.</i>

1552
01:33:41,936 --> 01:33:42,720
Ah.

1553
01:33:42,720 --> 01:33:45,958
- Prime Minister?
- Yes, Princess?

1554
01:33:47,239 --> 01:33:49,454
I move to abolish the marriage law,

1555
01:33:49,454 --> 01:33:53,688
as it applies to present
and future queens of Genovia.

1556
01:33:54,218 --> 01:33:56,065
Will anyone second my motion?

1557
01:33:59,316 --> 01:34:01,862
Keep eye contact with them.
Stare them down.

1558
01:34:02,862 --> 01:34:05,594
No, not, not... Soften. Soften.

1559
01:34:05,594 --> 01:34:06,802
Good.

1560
01:34:11,876 --> 01:34:15,909
I second the motion.

1561
01:34:18,406 --> 01:34:20,939
It's time we had a new tradition.
I like change.

1562
01:34:21,288 --> 01:34:22,657
I may grow a mustache.

1563
01:34:22,979 --> 01:34:24,540
I think you'd look marvelous
with a mustache.

1564
01:34:24,540 --> 01:34:26,439
You know, my father
always favored a Van Dyke...

1565
01:34:26,439 --> 01:34:27,572
Gentlemen, gentlemen. Please.

1566
01:34:28,574 --> 01:34:34,042
All those in favor of abolishing
the marriage rule, say, "Aye. "

1567
01:34:37,039 --> 01:34:37,728
Aye.

1568
01:34:39,542 --> 01:34:40,200
Aye.

1569
01:34:40,947 --> 01:34:42,687
- Aye.
- Aye.

1570
01:34:43,104 --> 01:34:45,948
- You're not in parliament. Sit down.
- Someday.

1571
01:34:45,948 --> 01:34:47,500
<i>(all) Aye.</i>

1572
01:34:48,511 --> 01:34:50,136

1573
01:34:50,623 --> 01:34:53,187
Congratulations, Princess.

1574
01:34:53,448 --> 01:34:55,125
If I may say so myself,

1575
01:34:55,544 --> 01:34:56,811
you rule!

1576
01:35:06,981 --> 01:35:07,791

1577
01:35:10,093 --> 01:35:11,104
Your Majesty?

1578
01:35:12,231 --> 01:35:13,073
Hm?

1579
01:35:13,073 --> 01:35:14,511
The princess would like a word.

1580
01:35:15,409 --> 01:35:16,609
Oh. Erm...

1581
01:35:20,409 --> 01:35:22,730
Grandma?

1582
01:35:23,438 --> 01:35:26,887
Just because I didn't
get my fairy-tale ending,

1583
01:35:27,470 --> 01:35:28,779
doesn't mean you shouldn't.

1584
01:35:31,106 --> 01:35:32,077
Oh, uh...

1585
01:35:32,481 --> 01:35:36,577
- Did you hear that?
- Not if you didn't want me to.

1586
01:35:36,950 --> 01:35:38,668
Oh, Charlotte.

1587
01:35:39,574 --> 01:35:40,824
Well.

1588
01:35:51,483 --> 01:35:52,223
Joseph?

1589
01:35:53,660 --> 01:35:54,666
Your Majesty.

1590
01:35:56,130 --> 01:35:58,889
Dear Joseph.

1591
01:36:00,814 --> 01:36:02,190
Am I too late...

1592
01:36:03,638 --> 01:36:07,013
to ask you to accept my hand in marriage?

1593
01:36:08,578 --> 01:36:10,107
<i>(clears throat)</i>

1594
01:36:12,139 --> 01:36:13,877
Well, I thought you'd never ask.

1595
01:36:15,098 --> 01:36:15,874
Shades?

1596
01:36:17,543 --> 01:36:20,200
You're in charge now.
Good luck with Lionel.

1597
01:36:21,764 --> 01:36:22,910
I'm going to a wedding.

1598
01:36:23,169 --> 01:36:25,579
<i>(Mabrey) Open up, I say! The door is shut.</i>

1599
01:36:26,016 --> 01:36:27,314
<i>Let me in.</i>

1600
01:36:28,920 --> 01:36:30,170
<i>Put me down. Put me down!</i>

1601
01:36:42,171 --> 01:36:44,484
I know it was short notice,
but you were all dressed.

1602
01:36:44,703 --> 01:36:56,255
My Lord Archbishop, I would like to take
this man as my husband, if you please.

1603
01:36:57,830 --> 01:36:58,827
Finally.

1604
01:37:00,046 --> 01:37:02,326
We have come together
for a different wedding...

1605
01:37:02,326 --> 01:37:04,472
- What did I miss?
- She's not getting married.

1606
01:37:04,472 --> 01:37:05,764
- She's not getting married?
- No.

1607
01:37:05,764 --> 01:37:08,014
With this ring, I thee...

1608
01:37:08,877 --> 01:37:10,234
finally...

1609
01:37:10,481 --> 01:37:11,295
wed.

1610
01:37:11,733 --> 01:37:13,860
- Now the queen's getting married.
- The queen's getting married?

1611
01:37:13,860 --> 01:37:14,859
Yeah, to Joe.

1612
01:37:15,788 --> 01:37:17,752
I pronounce you man and wife.

1613
01:37:18,755 --> 01:37:20,110
You may kiss the bride.

flaming arrow through the coronation ring.</i>

1615
01:38:07,545 --> 01:38:10,603
<i>(Elsie) Good morning. It's been
almost a week since the almost wedding,</i>

1616
01:38:10,603 --> 01:38:13,955
and busy workers
are setting up for Genovia's grand day.

1617
01:38:14,204 --> 01:38:16,267
<i>The coronation of a new queen.</i>

1618
01:38:16,602 --> 01:38:19,726
<i>Somewhere in the palace, Princess Mia's
getting ready for the ceremony</i>

1619
01:38:19,726 --> 01:38:22,415
that will change her life forever.

1620
01:38:25,547 --> 01:38:27,237
So what do you say, Fat Louie?

1621
01:38:28,220 --> 01:38:29,704
Think I'll make a good queen?

1622
01:38:32,005 --> 01:38:32,944
Indeed you will.

1623
01:38:35,318 --> 01:38:38,862
If I may be so bold, I would like
an audience with Your Highness.

1624
01:38:46,322 --> 01:38:47,985
What is your dilemma, young man?

1625
01:38:48,789 --> 01:38:50,391
You are, in fact.

1626
01:38:55,488 --> 01:38:57,458
I'm in love with the queen-to-be.

1627
01:38:59,113 --> 01:39:01,797
And I'm inquiring if she loves me too.

1628
01:39:04,643 --> 01:39:06,830
Do you have a chicken for my table?

1629
01:39:07,737 --> 01:39:11,158
No. No, my kitchen is out of chickens.

1630
01:39:11,550 --> 01:39:12,174
Ah.

1631
01:39:17,738 --> 01:39:18,738

to Berkeley to finish up graduate school.

You heard right.
