SOLARlS
Part One

21
00:06:41,079 --> 00:06:45,550
Chris! Come here!
You're just in time.

22
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:49,237
He takes a walk every morning
for at least an hour.

23
00:06:51,879 --> 00:06:54,757
He has been working too hard,
all night sometimes.

24
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,072
This science of solaristics of his!

25
00:06:58,278 --> 00:07:02,750
He reminds me of a bookkeeper
making up his accounts.

26
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:05,629
We expected you yesterday.

27
00:07:05,838 --> 00:07:08,228
He wanted to run away
when he saw me.

28
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,153
Hello!

29
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:18,918
How do you do?

30
00:07:23,838 --> 00:07:26,911
l guess l shouldn't have bothered
you today.

31
00:07:30,759 --> 00:07:34,992
How old we have grown!
l'm only now beginning to realize it.

32
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:41,548
Everything will depend on his
initial report from the station.

33
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:45,468
Every message we receive
is confusing or incomprehensible.

34
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:49,793
lf he confirms for us that
the study shouldn't continue,

35
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,560
the station can be taken out
of Solaris's orbit.

36
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:55,310
l understand.

37
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:58,319
You promised to talk to him.
l've brought the film.

38
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:01,677
Yes, of course.

39
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:06,749
Would you mind keeping
the boy for a few days?

40
00:08:09,639 --> 00:08:14,314
Anna'll be pleased to have him.
She'll have more free time now.

41
00:08:22,439 --> 00:08:24,713
When does he leave?

42
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:28,389
By this time tomorrow, he'll already
be gone.

43
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:40,916
lt's very pleasant here.

44
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:47,629
This house looks like my grand-
father's house. l liked it very much.

45
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:51,071
And so we built this one just like it.

46
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,070
l don't care much for new things.

47
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:25,230
Well, l better get going.
l've an awful lot to do.

48
00:10:27,879 --> 00:10:30,599
Don't you want to see this?

49
00:10:30,798 --> 00:10:33,153
l've already seen it many times.

50
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:38,916
Twenty-one days after the launch
of our expedition,

51
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:41,235
radio biologist Vishnyakov
and physicist Fechner

52
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:47,788
went on an exploration mission over
the Solaris ocean in an air vehicle.

53
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,548
When they failed to return,
we ordered a search.

54
00:10:51,759 --> 00:10:55,956
The fog was too dense,
and we had to call the search off.

55
00:10:56,158 --> 00:10:58,673
All of the rescue craft
returned to the station

56
00:10:58,879 --> 00:11:03,394
except the helicopter
piloted by Burton.

57
00:11:03,879 --> 00:11:07,316
He came back
only after the dark had set in.

58
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:13,868
He immediately ran to his quarters,
obviously in a state of shock.

59
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:20,110
lt was so unusual
for a man

60
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:21,639
who had been flying for 1 1 years.

61
00:11:21,879 --> 00:11:26,394
He had recovered in a couple of days,
but he would never leave the station.

62
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:30,149
And he refused to approach
the window overlooking the ocean.

63
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:34,475
While under medical care in a clinic
he offered to make a statement

64
00:11:34,677 --> 00:11:37,033
of great importance,

65
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:40,471
one which he felt could affect
the whole future of Project Solaris.

66
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:43,836
Very well, let's hear his story.

67
00:11:46,639 --> 00:11:50,995
Now is the time
to let Burton talk.

68
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,673
The first time l descended
below a thousand feet,

69
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:06,076
l had trouble maintaining altitude,

70
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,754
because the wind had come up.

71
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:14,595
All my efforts were required
in operating the ship.

72
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:18,668
l wasn't watching outside.

73
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:22,474
As a result, l entered the fog bank.

74
00:12:22,677 --> 00:12:24,317
Was that an ordinary fog?

75
00:12:24,519 --> 00:12:27,509
lt was like nothing l'd ever seen
before.

76
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:31,918
lt seemed to be a colloidal substance,
a gluey mass.

77
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:34,389
All the windows were coated.

78
00:12:35,557 --> 00:12:41,317
Because of the fog's resistance
l began to lose altitude.

79
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:47,474
Where l supposed the sun would be,
the fog glowed like fire.

80
00:12:49,759 --> 00:12:52,990
Half an hour later, l emerged
into a large open space.

81
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:58,071
The patch was round,
about a few hundred meters across.

82
00:13:00,278 --> 00:13:05,591
At that moment l observed
great changes in the ocean.

83
00:13:05,798 --> 00:13:11,397
The water became still,
and the surface looked transparent.

84
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:14,589
A sort of yellow mucus started
to congeal under it.

85
00:13:16,038 --> 00:13:21,990
When it rose up,
it glistened like glass.

86
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:26,908
Then it began to boil,
and a frothy crust appeared on top.

87
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:29,998
The surface was brown
like burned sugar syrup.

88
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:36,393
This substance solidified into big
lumps,

89
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:40,792
giving shape to
all sorts of figures.

90
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:43,913
l was being drawn to
the fog bank,

91
00:13:44,158 --> 00:13:47,596
so l had to struggle
against this force for some time.

92
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:49,716
When l looked down again,

93
00:13:49,918 --> 00:13:53,673
l saw a sort of garden.

94
00:13:53,879 --> 00:13:55,153
A garden?

95
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:58,158
Quiet, please.

96
00:13:59,399 --> 00:14:03,153
l could see vegetation, hedges,
acacia trees, narrow paths.

97
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:06,076
All of this same substance.

98
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:10,230
And all these trees and plants,
did they have leaves?

99
00:14:10,798 --> 00:14:13,109
Those bushes, acacias?

100
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:17,312
They looked like they were made of
plastic, but in real-life proportions.

101
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:20,918
All of a sudden cracks started
to appear.

102
00:14:23,158 --> 00:14:29,870
The boiling began again,
all was in froth.

103
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:34,470
You'll be able to see it
for yourselves.

104
00:14:36,879 --> 00:14:40,634
Everything l saw
will be on the film.

105
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:44,673
Then l suggest
we interrupt the hearing

106
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:49,312
and look at it
with our own eyes.

107
00:14:50,158 --> 00:14:55,518
Yes, show us the film.
lt's very interesting.

108
00:16:28,879 --> 00:16:35,067
- ls that all?
- Yes, that's all there is.

109
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:37,557
But we don't understand.

110
00:16:40,918 --> 00:16:42,956
Your film is nothing but clouds!

111
00:16:43,158 --> 00:16:46,994
That must be the fog
l was talking about.

112
00:16:49,557 --> 00:16:51,754
l'm as surprised
as you are.

113
00:16:53,918 --> 00:16:57,706
All this might be the result of
the bio-magnetic current of

114
00:16:57,918 --> 00:16:59,590
the Solaris ocean acting on Burton's
conscience.

115
00:16:59,798 --> 00:17:03,791
We know these currents to be not
only a gigantic cerebral system,

116
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:05,711
but also to be capable
of generating thought.

117
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:08,912
That is a hypothesis
that has not been confirmed.

118
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:12,679
Weren't you ill on that particular
day?

119
00:17:13,798 --> 00:17:15,992
Oh, this next part is pointless.

120
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:22,518
We'll pick up here.

121
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:26,394
...l saw something floating.

122
00:17:28,117 --> 00:17:34,468
l thought that it looked like
Fechner's space suit.

123
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:38,710
l kept circling the spot to make sure
l wouldn't lose sight of it.

124
00:17:39,837 --> 00:17:43,719
Suddenly l could see the form
rise slightly,

125
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:49,236
as if treading the waters.

126
00:17:52,038 --> 00:17:56,192
l could see the man, he wasn't
wearing a space suit, and he moved.

127
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:58,152
You mean it was human?

128
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:00,673
Yes, human.

129
00:18:04,317 --> 00:18:06,595
You saw his face?

130
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:07,835
Yes.

131
00:18:13,557 --> 00:18:14,959
What man?

132
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:21,076
Who was he?

133
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:25,913
lt was an infant.

134
00:18:27,038 --> 00:18:29,873
- Did you recognize it?
- l'd never seen it before.

135
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:35,556
When l circled nearer,

136
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:40,317
what l saw was monstrous.

137
00:18:40,519 --> 00:18:42,192
What do you mean?

138
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:48,230
At first l couldn't make it out,

139
00:18:49,357 --> 00:18:52,750
but then it became clear
that it was incredibly huge.

140
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:58,997
lt was twelve feet tall.

141
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:06,396
lts eyes were blue,
its hair was dark.

142
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:08,238
lf you're not feeling well,

143
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:14,316
we can recess the hearing.

144
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:17,153
l will continue.

145
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:30,153
lt was absolutely naked,
as if new born.

146
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:35,957
And it was moist, or rather slippery.

147
00:19:36,798 --> 00:19:38,596
lts skin was glistening.

148
00:19:39,117 --> 00:19:42,430
lt rose and fell
with the waves,

149
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:44,355
but it was moving by itself.

150
00:19:44,557 --> 00:19:46,516
The whole thing was repugnant.

151
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:00,588
Wait a minute,

152
00:20:01,759 --> 00:20:03,509
there isn't very much more.

153
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:07,240
...Burton's statements
would appear to be

154
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:09,991
the expression
of a hallucinatory complex,

155
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:12,472
induced by atmospheric
influences of the planet,

156
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:16,107
plus obscure symptoms to which
the brain's cortical substance

157
00:20:16,317 --> 00:20:20,596
contributed in some measure through
the excitation of associated zones.

158
00:20:21,557 --> 00:20:26,711
This report in no way reflects
the actual facts.

159
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:29,749
Or almost in no way.

160
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:36,028
There's a different opinion
offered by Professor Messenger

161
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:39,152
who believes
that the information

162
00:20:39,357 --> 00:20:41,191
supplied by Burton
could be true

163
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:47,154
and needs to be
thoroughly studied.

164
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:51,074
l saw everything l described
with my own eyes!

165
00:20:54,357 --> 00:20:57,509
l would dare to venture
another opinion.

166
00:20:58,317 --> 00:21:01,115
We are on the verge
of an immense discovery,

167
00:21:01,837 --> 00:21:07,278
and it would be unwise to be
influenced by the fact that we base

168
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:11,678
our decision upon the observations
of an unqualified layman.

169
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:16,317
Every explorer may well envy
this pilot,

170
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:20,758
his presence of mind,
his talents of observation.

171
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:24,827
Moreover, given
the recent information,

172
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:30,837
we are bound morally
to press forward with our probes.

173
00:21:31,798 --> 00:21:35,790
l can understand
how Professor Messenger feels,

174
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,798
however let's look back
at the long road we've traveled.

175
00:21:39,117 --> 00:21:45,229
For all our work, the Solaris probes
are back where we began.

176
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:48,910
Years of effort
have proven useless.

177
00:21:51,837 --> 00:21:56,834
All we know about Solaris

178
00:21:57,038 --> 00:21:59,790
reminds me of a mountain
of separate facts

179
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:05,313
which we are unable to squeeze
into the framework of any conception.

180
00:22:06,357 --> 00:22:09,796
Well, we're even worse off today,
as regards the essential.

181
00:22:11,357 --> 00:22:13,112
Solaristics is degenerating.

182
00:22:13,317 --> 00:22:17,757
The essential question is far more
serious than just Solaristics.

183
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:21,269
We're probing the very frontier
of human knowledge.

184
00:22:21,759 --> 00:22:25,067
By artificially establishing
a knowledge frontier,

185
00:22:25,278 --> 00:22:29,796
we limit our concept of
the infinity of man's knowledge.

186
00:22:30,278 --> 00:22:35,832
And if our movement is not forward,
do we not risk moving backward?

187
00:22:38,557 --> 00:22:40,355
What do you mean by saying
that the information supplied by me

188
00:22:40,557 --> 00:22:42,835
is in no way reflects the actual
facts?

189
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:48,549
l saw all this with my own eyes.

190
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:53,192
lt means
that some real phenomena

191
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:55,826
could have triggered
your hallucinating.

192
00:22:58,077 --> 00:23:01,433
ln windy weather
it's very easy

193
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:04,788
to mistake a swinging bush
for a living creature.

194
00:23:05,519 --> 00:23:08,395
To say nothing of a strange planet!

195
00:23:08,837 --> 00:23:11,673
There's nothing offending in it
for you.

196
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:16,996
What action are you going to take
in view of Prof.Messenger's opinion?

197
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:19,788
Practically none at all.

198
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:25,632
Our research in this area
will be discontinued.

199
00:23:27,357 --> 00:23:29,237
l have a statement to make.

200
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:33,911
lt's not my reputation but the spirit
of the expedition that you offend...

201
00:23:38,357 --> 00:23:40,112
Well, et cetera...

202
00:23:43,038 --> 00:23:45,028
lt's considered to be good manners
now

203
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:48,355
to laugh whenever Burton's report
is mentioned.

204
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:55,679
We've known you a long time,
but still l know so little about you.

205
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,990
You were very handsome then.

206
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:04,988
You don't mean that, but thanks
anyway.

207
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:15,635
Well, Chris, what do you think
about all this?

208
00:24:16,597 --> 00:24:23,596
l would like to speak to your son
alone.

209
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:28,230
l hate to look like an idiot
before you once more.

210
00:24:30,357 --> 00:24:33,238
l'll wait for you outside
by the swing.

211
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:40,910
He looks ridiculous, your Burton.

212
00:24:41,117 --> 00:24:47,468
Don't say that.
He's obviously ill at ease.

213
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:50,953
He feels he's intruding on us.

214
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:59,836
lf he decided to come, it's because
he considers the matter so important.

215
00:25:01,278 --> 00:25:05,478
l didn't want to see outsiders
today any more than you did.

216
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:08,317
We don't talk to each other often
enough.

217
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:16,634
lt's good to hear you say that.

218
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:20,308
Even on the last day.

219
00:25:32,278 --> 00:25:33,915
The last day...

220
00:25:37,357 --> 00:25:40,238
When the farewells are overdone,

221
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:42,749
you feel awful afterwards.

222
00:25:44,278 --> 00:25:49,192
Let's meet after dinner.
We need to talk.

223
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:54,394
And still, why did you invite this
Burton fellow today of all days?

224
00:25:56,117 --> 00:25:59,351
Where are the guests going to sleep?

225
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:03,237
Upstairs, l guess.

226
00:26:05,117 --> 00:26:08,394
Well, l'll be down by the swing.

227
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:11,028
- But perhaps...
- Just a second.

228
00:26:13,357 --> 00:26:15,749
The question of where they're
going to sleep can wait!

229
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,471
Listen, Chris...

230
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:45,356
What's the matter?

231
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:50,835
What is it down there, standing
in the garage and looking at me?

232
00:26:51,038 --> 00:26:52,596
lt's just a horse.

233
00:26:52,798 --> 00:26:54,549
l've seen it already.

234
00:26:54,759 --> 00:26:56,239
Come on!

235
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:03,153
He's very gentle.
Look how beautiful he is!

236
00:27:09,357 --> 00:27:14,275
l think that Solaristics
is at an impasse

237
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:17,788
as a result of
irresponsible fantasizing.

238
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:19,749
l'm only interested in truth,

239
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:23,836
but you want to convince me
of your point of view.

240
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:28,469
l can't draw conclusions
based on ''reasons of heart''.

241
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:31,672
l'm not a poet.
My problem is simple:

242
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:34,789
either end the research,
withdrawing the station from orbit

243
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:38,913
and legalizing the crisis in
Solaristics,

244
00:27:39,117 --> 00:27:41,315
or take extreme measures,

245
00:27:41,519 --> 00:27:44,159
like bombarding the ocean
with high intensity beams.

246
00:27:44,357 --> 00:27:45,998
No, not that!

247
00:27:46,519 --> 00:27:50,832
Didn't you want to continue
the research at any price?

248
00:27:51,038 --> 00:27:56,750
And you want to destroy that which
we aren't capable of understanding?

249
00:27:57,640 --> 00:28:01,596
No, l don't advocate knowledge
at any price.

250
00:28:02,317 --> 00:28:06,757
Knowledge is only valid when
it rests on a foundation of morality.

251
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:11,959
Man is the only agent
who renders science immoral.

252
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:13,385
Don't forget Hiroshima.

253
00:28:13,597 --> 00:28:17,912
Then don't make science immoral!
lt's strange...

254
00:28:21,077 --> 00:28:23,990
There's nothing strange about it.

255
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:27,996
Even you can't be sure that

256
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:32,713
all you had seen
weren'tjust hallucinations.

257
00:28:33,117 --> 00:28:36,587
Thank you for your time. We have
nothing more to say to each other.

258
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:42,912
- ls anything the matter?
- l'm leaving.

259
00:28:43,117 --> 00:28:44,075
Leaving?

260
00:28:47,077 --> 00:28:48,957
He is a bookkeeper, not a scientist.

261
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:52,230
We're friends, Burton, but you
shouldn't say that about him!

262
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:56,672
We've known each other for 20 years.
lt had to end someday, l guess.

263
00:28:57,357 --> 00:28:59,669
Are you leaving the child?

264
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:14,990
Why did you have to offend him?
You're heartless.

265
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:18,317
lt's dangerous to send
your kind to the cosmos.

266
00:29:18,519 --> 00:29:21,592
Everything is far too fragile there!

267
00:29:21,837 --> 00:29:24,510
The earth somehow manages to put up
with men of your sort,

268
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:27,757
though at what cost to humanity!

269
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:32,030
Are you jealous of the fact that he
will be the one to bury me, not you?

270
00:29:49,038 --> 00:29:54,034
lt'd been established that the Solaris
ocean is a peculiar kind of brain.

271
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:57,517
Later, even a more daring hypothesis
was put forward,

272
00:29:57,720 --> 00:30:01,076
that is the Ocean is
a thinking substance.

273
00:30:02,077 --> 00:30:09,028
For years this hypothesis could not
have been substantiated.

274
00:30:09,759 --> 00:30:11,588
This program is about Solaris.

275
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:16,352
Very few true believers
have remained.

276
00:30:16,557 --> 00:30:20,028
First of all, they are those
who are connected with the station.

277
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:25,106
On the station for a 85-strong crew,
only three men are still working.

278
00:30:25,317 --> 00:30:27,515
They are astrobiologist Sartorius,

279
00:30:28,597 --> 00:30:29,999
cyberneticist Snout

280
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:34,713
and physiologist Guibariane
who is dealing with the problem...

281
00:30:36,038 --> 00:30:37,871
l'm calling from the city.

282
00:30:38,077 --> 00:30:39,229
Burton!

283
00:30:41,357 --> 00:30:44,557
Anna, please, we need to talk.

284
00:30:50,798 --> 00:30:55,999
What l talked to Chris about was not
important. l should have told him

285
00:30:56,519 --> 00:31:01,115
about Messenger who had
a different opinion at that meeting.

286
00:31:02,278 --> 00:31:06,592
He got very much interested in
Fechner who died in Solaris Ocean.

287
00:31:08,117 --> 00:31:14,750
lt turned out that Fechner has an
orphaned son, he had left his family.

288
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:20,476
Messenger and l paid a visit
to Fechner's widow.

289
00:31:21,519 --> 00:31:24,077
l saw this child with my own eyes.

290
00:31:24,278 --> 00:31:26,394
You never told me about that.

291
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:32,112
- l didn't have a chance.
- All right, what about it?

292
00:31:32,317 --> 00:31:37,440
He looked exactly like the child
l'd seen on Solaris.

293
00:31:38,077 --> 00:31:40,469
Except that he wasn't twelve feet
tall.

294
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:45,152
lt wouldn't be good for him
to think about it before the launch,

295
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:49,593
but he should remember this
when he's there.

296
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:24,351
There's no point in keeping these.

297
00:37:24,639 --> 00:37:27,677
The only ones to be kept
are those in my room.

298
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:49,596
All my research notes, my thesis...
l wonder why we kept all these?

299
00:37:57,320 --> 00:38:04,192
Should something happens, l'll find
someone to take care of them.

300
00:38:04,679 --> 00:38:10,710
Oh, don't look for the film with
the campfire. l'm taking it with me.

301
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:12,797
Oh, sure, do that...

302
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:17,358
- Ready, Kelvin?
- Ready!

303
00:41:17,559 --> 00:41:22,793
You have nothing to worry about.
Have a good trip.

304
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:27,755
- When is the lift-off?
- You're already under way!

305
00:41:58,840 --> 00:42:02,070
Station Solaris!
Can you do something?

306
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:06,909
l seem to be losing stability.

307
00:43:55,639 --> 00:43:59,518
Where are you all?
You've got company!

308
00:45:26,760 --> 00:45:28,751
Doctor Snout?

309
00:45:53,199 --> 00:45:54,838
Snout?

310
00:46:03,400 --> 00:46:06,233
l'm Kelvin, psychologist.

311
00:46:08,079 --> 00:46:11,152
lt appears you weren't expecting me.

312
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:16,237
Did you receive the radiogram?

313
00:46:19,960 --> 00:46:24,112
Yes, certainly.

314
00:46:37,039 --> 00:46:39,679
Why are you so upset?

315
00:46:43,480 --> 00:46:47,108
l'm sorry...

316
00:46:48,639 --> 00:46:51,757
Where is Guibariane?
And Sartorius?

317
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:55,675
Sartorius is in his quarters.
Guibariane is dead.

318
00:46:55,880 --> 00:46:57,791
Dead?

319
00:47:01,039 --> 00:47:02,710
He committed suicide...

320
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:11,112
l knew Guibariane. lt's not like
him to...

321
00:47:11,320 --> 00:47:15,632
He was in a state
of profound depression.

322
00:47:16,599 --> 00:47:21,070
Since these mysterious disorders
began...

323
00:47:25,400 --> 00:47:31,349
Maybe you'd better rest, take a bath.
You may take any room.

324
00:47:31,599 --> 00:47:33,590
Come here in an hour.

325
00:47:34,360 --> 00:47:38,911
l'm impatient to meet with
Guibariane... l mean Sartorius.

326
00:47:39,119 --> 00:47:43,635
l doubt if he'll let you in.
He's up in his laboratory.

327
00:47:43,840 --> 00:47:49,516
Listen, l'm aware that something
extraordinary has happened,

328
00:47:49,719 --> 00:47:51,994
and perhaps l...

329
00:47:57,400 --> 00:47:58,992
Doctor Kelvin...

330
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:07,597
You see...
Please, come in an hour.

331
00:48:08,719 --> 00:48:12,155
Go now, and rest.

332
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:17,112
Now there're only three of us on
the station: you, me and Sartorius.

333
00:48:17,320 --> 00:48:19,914
You know what we look like
from our photographs.

334
00:48:20,119 --> 00:48:24,750
lf you see anything out of
the ordinary, not me or Sartorius,

335
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:26,871
try not to lose your head.

336
00:48:27,079 --> 00:48:31,710
- What would l see?
- That depends on you.

337
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:37,755
- Hallucinations?
- No... but don't forget.

338
00:48:37,960 --> 00:48:40,996
- Forget what?
- That we're not on earth.

339
00:48:42,039 --> 00:48:46,079
Why don't we have our talk tonight?

340
00:48:46,280 --> 00:48:49,396
No, let's make it tomorrow morning!

341
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:34,835
A. GUlBARlANE

342
00:50:38,518 --> 00:50:41,318
HUMAN BElNG

343
00:51:09,639 --> 00:51:11,994
TO C. KELVlN

344
00:51:30,159 --> 00:51:32,114
Hello, Chris.

345
00:51:39,559 --> 00:51:41,835
l still have a little time left.

346
00:51:42,039 --> 00:51:44,679
There're certain things l must tell
you,

347
00:51:45,159 --> 00:51:47,389
that l must warn you about.

348
00:51:47,960 --> 00:51:51,918
l suppose you've been told
what happened to me.

349
00:51:52,119 --> 00:51:56,476
lf not, Snout or Sartorius
can tell you the details.

350
00:51:57,760 --> 00:52:02,231
What happened to me,

351
00:52:04,518 --> 00:52:06,476
it matters little.

352
00:52:06,719 --> 00:52:10,474
The trouble is that no one can really
explain it.

353
00:52:10,679 --> 00:52:14,592
l'm afraid that what's happened to me
is only a beginning.

354
00:52:16,320 --> 00:52:17,469
l wouldn't wish it, of course,

355
00:52:17,719 --> 00:52:23,715
but it may happen to all of you.

356
00:52:24,639 --> 00:52:29,838
Here, it may happen to anyone,
for sure.

357
00:52:30,039 --> 00:52:32,315
But don't think that l've gone mad.

358
00:52:39,840 --> 00:52:42,034
You know me well.

359
00:52:44,559 --> 00:52:47,835
lf l have enough time, l'll tell you
why l did this.

360
00:52:48,840 --> 00:52:56,838
lf it does happen to you,
you will know it's not madness.

361
00:52:57,039 --> 00:52:58,757
That's the main thing.

362
00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:03,317
As for continuing
our program of research,

363
00:53:03,960 --> 00:53:06,190
l'm of the same opinion
as Sartorius.

364
00:53:06,599 --> 00:53:11,469
Bombard the plasma of the ocean
by high-powered X-rays.

365
00:53:12,840 --> 00:53:16,514
lt's prohibited,
but there's no other choice.

366
00:53:16,760 --> 00:53:21,833
We - or rather you - will be drawn in.

367
00:53:24,039 --> 00:53:29,592
lt may offer a way
to break this deadlock.

368
00:53:30,880 --> 00:53:34,077
lt's your only chance to establish
contact with this monster.

369
00:53:34,280 --> 00:53:36,998
There's no other solution left.

370
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:38,998
lf you...

371
00:56:47,280 --> 00:56:52,831
Doctor Sartorius, my name is Kelvin.
l arrived two hours ago.

372
00:57:04,518 --> 00:57:08,306
Look, l'm in a ridiculous
situation here.

373
00:57:11,679 --> 00:57:14,478
Either you open up,
or l'll break the door!

374
00:57:14,719 --> 00:57:20,157
All right, l'll open the door, but
don't come in. l'll come out.

375
00:57:23,880 --> 00:57:25,996
My name is Kelvin.

376
00:57:28,239 --> 00:57:34,393
You must have heard of me.
l worked with Guibariane.

377
00:57:34,880 --> 00:57:39,396
Dr. Snout told me about Guibariane...
l can't believe it.

378
00:57:39,960 --> 00:57:43,713
So, you know the story.

379
00:57:44,719 --> 00:57:49,396
Yes, it's horrible. l have no details,
l only know he's dead.

380
00:57:49,599 --> 00:57:52,556
All of us may die.

381
00:57:52,760 --> 00:57:57,753
But he insisted upon being buried
on the earth.

382
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:03,393
Guibariane wanted to be in
the earth, with the worms.

383
00:58:03,599 --> 00:58:05,476
Have you ever heard of Burton?

384
00:58:05,719 --> 00:58:09,507
Yes, he was on the search party
for Fechner.

385
00:58:09,760 --> 00:58:12,637
Fechner died a magnificent death,
and Guibariane was a coward.

386
00:58:12,840 --> 00:58:16,514
Please... He's dead!
Why judge him?

387
00:58:16,760 --> 00:58:23,597
Duty to the truth is the only concern
that should count.

388
00:58:23,800 --> 00:58:26,757
You are misguided in your search.
Look...

389
00:58:31,920 --> 00:58:36,516
This courage you pretend to
is only inhumanity.

390
00:58:44,159 --> 00:58:47,469
Go away.
You're obviously overemotional.

391
00:58:47,719 --> 00:58:51,599
You must adapt yourself.
Good health to you.

392
01:01:47,360 --> 01:01:49,920
l saw Sartorius and we spoke.

393
01:01:50,559 --> 01:01:52,675
l don't find him very likable.

394
01:01:52,880 --> 01:01:55,313
He's a very talented scientist.

395
01:02:01,400 --> 01:02:05,552
l'm afraid
l don't feel so well.

396
01:02:06,400 --> 01:02:10,438
There's nothing wrong with you,
but you won't listen to advice.

397
01:02:10,679 --> 01:02:14,958
Aside from the three of us, is there
anyone else on the station?

398
01:02:15,159 --> 01:02:16,512
Did you see anything?

399
01:02:18,679 --> 01:02:21,911
What were you warning me against?

400
01:02:22,119 --> 01:02:23,838
What did you see?

401
01:02:24,039 --> 01:02:28,079
A human being? Was she real?

402
01:02:29,518 --> 01:02:33,228
Can she be touched or felt,
or wounded, hurt?

403
01:02:33,920 --> 01:02:36,434
When did you see her the last time,
today?

404
01:02:38,480 --> 01:02:41,472
And you, how do l know
who you are?

405
01:02:46,960 --> 01:02:48,393
Shhh...

406
01:03:00,079 --> 01:03:03,152
- Where did she come from?
- Leave me alone!

407
01:03:05,518 --> 01:03:07,476
You're afraid...

408
01:03:11,280 --> 01:03:16,911
Don't worry, l'm not going
to think you're insane.

409
01:03:17,119 --> 01:03:23,070
Me, insane? Oh God,
you know so little...

410
01:03:24,360 --> 01:03:26,793
Madness would be a blessing!

411
01:03:33,400 --> 01:03:35,356
Snout, listen...

412
01:04:39,280 --> 01:04:41,157
lt's all so absurd.

413
01:04:42,360 --> 01:04:44,190
They don't understand anything.

414
01:04:44,400 --> 01:04:47,072
They're sure that l've gone mad.

415
01:04:55,480 --> 01:04:58,516
Though it's something like insanity,
l've got to do this.

416
01:04:58,719 --> 01:05:02,474
l'm afraid that Snout and Sartorius
will try to force their way in.

417
01:05:02,719 --> 01:05:07,748
They don't understand what they're
doing. l'm frightened, Chris...

418
01:05:08,518 --> 01:05:10,157
l can't...

419
01:05:11,440 --> 01:05:13,954
No one will ever understand...

420
01:05:14,320 --> 01:05:18,472
Guibariane, open the door!
Don't be a fool!

421
01:05:18,719 --> 01:05:21,313
That's us, Snout and Sartorius!

422
01:05:21,559 --> 01:05:23,039
We want to help you!

423
01:05:23,518 --> 01:05:25,670
They say they want to help me.

424
01:05:26,840 --> 01:05:29,672
All right, quit knocking.

425
01:05:38,840 --> 01:05:40,795
l'm my own judge.

426
01:05:44,079 --> 01:05:45,717
Have you seen her?

427
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:50,469
Try to understand, Chris, l'm not mad.

428
01:05:53,559 --> 01:05:58,315
lt has to do with my conscience.

429
01:06:07,840 --> 01:06:13,391
l really hoped
you'd get here in time.

430
01:10:46,078 --> 01:10:47,716
How did you...

431
01:10:52,198 --> 01:10:54,029
lt's so good!

432
01:11:08,880 --> 01:11:14,636
But you can't possibly... How did
you find out where l was?

433
01:11:15,198 --> 01:11:16,917
What do you mean ''find out''?

434
01:11:24,118 --> 01:11:26,759
Don't, Chris, that tickles.

435
01:11:36,078 --> 01:11:39,390
Where are my shoes?

436
01:11:55,960 --> 01:11:58,872
No... they're not there.

437
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:11,399
Who's this?

438
01:12:30,037 --> 01:12:34,988
Chris, this is me...

439
01:12:44,319 --> 01:12:45,957
You know...

440
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:51,149
l have a feeling

441
01:12:55,279 --> 01:12:57,395
as if l've forgotten something.

442
01:13:08,078 --> 01:13:10,036
What's the matter with me?..

443
01:13:14,760 --> 01:13:16,193
Do you love me?

444
01:13:16,399 --> 01:13:20,631
Why do you have to ask, Hari,
as if you didn't know.

445
01:13:20,840 --> 01:13:23,832
l've got to go out.
l won't be long, wait here.

446
01:13:24,037 --> 01:13:28,238
- Can't l come with you?
- No. l'll be back soon.

447
01:13:29,399 --> 01:13:30,912
No!

448
01:13:31,118 --> 01:13:33,475
Why?

449
01:13:36,840 --> 01:13:39,479
l don't know...
l can't...

450
01:13:39,720 --> 01:13:41,756
You can't what?

451
01:13:42,479 --> 01:13:47,997
l feel like l've got to be with you...
all the time, to see you...

452
01:13:48,800 --> 01:13:53,997
Why are you being so childish?
l've work to do, Hari.

453
01:14:01,399 --> 01:14:03,993
You're right, l'm acting childish.

454
01:14:05,640 --> 01:14:11,590
As for you, you're as nervous
as Snout.

455
01:14:12,680 --> 01:14:15,988
- As who?
- As Doctor Snout.

456
01:14:17,359 --> 01:14:20,238
How do you know...

457
01:14:23,479 --> 01:14:27,189
l've got to go.
lf you want, you can come with me.

458
01:14:28,279 --> 01:14:33,591
But you won't be able to get
into a suit with your dress on.

459
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:40,149
Help me, l can't do it by myself.

460
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:27,389
Why do you keep staring at me?

461
01:16:55,868 --> 01:16:57,144
Yes, come quickly.O

462
01:19:07,269 --> 01:19:08,256
You might at least knock.W

463
01:19:08,868 --> 01:19:11,176
l thought
l heard you talking to someone.

464
01:19:12,229 --> 01:19:13,265
All the more reason.

465
01:19:14,109 --> 01:19:18,658
So you've had visitors?
You handle that very cleanly.

466
01:19:21,109 --> 01:19:23,622
Well, you won't die from it.

467
01:19:25,269 --> 01:19:26,908
l hope you used moderation
in the beginning.

468
01:19:27,828 --> 01:19:30,707
Narcotics, poisons, barbiturates, eh?

469
01:19:32,189 --> 01:19:35,148
lf you came here to clown,
you might as well leave.

470
01:19:35,429 --> 01:19:42,618
You're not going to tell me
you haven't tried the rope or hammer?

471
01:19:42,828 --> 01:19:46,344
l don't suppose you threw an inkwell
as Luther did?

472
01:19:55,787 --> 01:20:02,103
You just locked her in,
pressed the button and that's it!

473
01:20:04,229 --> 01:20:06,823
Next time, you mustn't panic.

474
01:20:08,069 --> 01:20:11,426
Try to launch it from the corridor.V

475
01:20:12,510 --> 01:20:14,818
- Do you know what it was?
- No.D

476
01:20:15,189 --> 01:20:17,942
But we've been able to establish
a theory at least.

477
01:20:19,828 --> 01:20:24,140
- Who was it?
- She died ten years ago.

478
01:20:25,707 --> 01:20:29,385
You've just seen the materialization
of the person you think you knew.

479
01:20:30,510 --> 01:20:32,421
- What was her name?
- Hari.

480
01:20:41,948 --> 01:20:46,578
This began after we experimented
with X-rays.

481
01:20:48,109 --> 01:20:51,895
We wanted to test the ocean,

482
01:20:52,109 --> 01:20:54,667
so we initiated a concentrated surface
sweep using high intensity rays.

483
01:20:56,229 --> 01:20:57,185
Yes, but this is...r

484
01:20:57,390 --> 01:21:01,349
You're fortunate. This woman is
only part of your past.

485
01:21:02,069 --> 01:21:04,104
lmagine if you had seen something else,

486
01:21:04,310 --> 01:21:07,541
something unknown in your experience,
out of the recesses of your soul.

487
01:21:09,069 --> 01:21:10,502
l don't see what you mean...

488
01:21:10,707 --> 01:21:16,103
Apparently the ocean somehow
probed our brain centers,

489
01:21:16,310 --> 01:21:18,777
from which it extracted
isolated bits of memory.

490
01:21:23,868 --> 01:21:28,180
- You think she'll come back?
- She will and she won't.

491
01:21:32,787 --> 01:21:35,939
- Hari the second...
- There may be many of her.

492
01:21:36,149 --> 01:21:39,426
- Why didn't you warn me?
- You wouldn't have believed me.t

493
01:21:40,189 --> 01:21:44,546
l got scared and acted not very...t

494
01:21:44,787 --> 01:21:46,823
Don't berate yourself.v

495
01:21:48,787 --> 01:21:51,176
The point is to liquidate the station.s

496
01:21:52,109 --> 01:21:54,305
This is my mission.t

497
01:21:56,229 --> 01:21:59,743
lf l make out the report,
will you sign it?

498
01:22:00,269 --> 01:22:02,385
What if she were the contact
we've been waiting for, for so long?

499
01:22:04,349 --> 01:22:06,020
The night is a blessed time here.

500
01:22:06,948 --> 01:22:09,510
Somehow it reminds me of the earth. 

501
01:22:10,269 --> 01:22:13,341
You can also tie strips of paper
to the air vents.r

502
01:22:16,069 --> 01:22:20,743
At night you'll think you're hearing
leaves rustle in the dark.

503
01:22:21,988 --> 01:22:25,380
Guibariane's invention. Like all
strokes of genius, it's so simple.

504
01:22:27,550 --> 01:22:31,384
Sartorius said we were sentimental
fools,

505
01:22:32,189 --> 01:22:33,702
but he has something like that
hidden in his closet.k

506
01:22:36,229 --> 01:22:41,384
Try and get some rest.
We'll meet in the library later.

507
01:22:42,310 --> 01:22:44,426
l've prepared a list of books for you.

508
01:24:30,590 --> 01:24:32,625
Snout, is that you?g

509
01:24:39,868 --> 01:24:43,622
Chris, where are you? 

510
01:24:44,908 --> 01:24:45,863
Come here.d

511
01:26:19,269 --> 01:26:20,225
lt's so dark... 

512
01:26:20,630 --> 01:26:22,426
Come here, don't be afraid!

513
01:27:18,309 --> 01:27:20,662
The door opens the other way!n

514
01:28:16,029 --> 01:28:17,984
Don't be afraid. l'll be right back.r

515
01:29:05,630 --> 01:29:08,426
When l saw that you weren't there,
l was afraid...c

516
01:29:12,390 --> 01:29:13,505
Hi, Chris! 

517
01:29:15,390 --> 01:29:20,100
l can hardly hear you.
What are you doing right now?

518
01:29:22,189 --> 01:29:23,587
Nothing.b

519
01:29:24,229 --> 01:29:29,301
Sartorius wants to see us
in the laboratory.y

520
01:29:30,546 --> 01:29:32,586
Yes, l'll be right with you.

521
01:29:46,546 --> 01:29:48,426
Chris, what's wrong with me?y

522
01:30:04,309 --> 01:30:07,143
ls it epilepsy?d

523
01:30:59,948 --> 01:31:00,904
This is my wife.o

524
01:31:03,948 --> 01:31:04,904
How do you do?d

525
01:31:08,269 --> 01:31:09,942
Hi.g

526
01:31:12,546 --> 01:31:13,505
We've been waiting for you.e

527
01:31:13,787 --> 01:31:15,269
l couldn't get away sooner.t

528
01:31:17,029 --> 01:31:20,100
- Are these yours?
- No, they're Snout's.

529
01:31:22,069 --> 01:31:27,587
As far as l'm able to observe,
they are structured...

530
01:31:27,787 --> 01:31:29,506
Let's call them ''The Visitors''.e

531
01:31:30,787 --> 01:31:36,261
While our structure is atomical,
theirs is based on neutrinos.

532
01:31:36,908 --> 01:31:40,585
But any neutrino system
would lack stability. 

533
01:31:41,390 --> 01:31:43,984
There must be a magnetic field out of
Solaris stabilizing them.

534
01:31:49,787 --> 01:31:51,345
You've got an excellent specimen.n

535
01:31:53,590 --> 01:31:54,542
She is my wife!i

536
01:31:55,868 --> 01:31:58,337
My congratulations. l'm delighted.

537
01:32:01,787 --> 01:32:04,747
Take a blood sample
from your ''wife''.a

538
01:32:05,029 --> 01:32:08,180
- Why should l?
- You'll see things a lot clearer.

539
01:32:42,948 --> 01:32:47,420
What do you think, Snout?s

540
01:32:47,630 --> 01:32:48,743
l'm fed up with the lot of you!b

541
01:32:51,390 --> 01:32:54,188
l used acid to burn the blood,
but it regenerates itself.

542
01:32:54,509 --> 01:33:00,582
Self-regeneration?
lmmortality! Faust's problem.a

543
01:33:06,747 --> 01:33:07,863
There's no need of absorbent cotton.n

544
01:33:10,029 --> 01:33:12,542
Are you qualified to perform
an autopsy?l

545
01:33:13,069 --> 01:33:15,425
She's my wife.
Don't you understand?n

546
01:33:16,189 --> 01:33:21,104
lt's more humane to experiment on
them than on the earth rabbits.

547
01:33:21,828 --> 01:33:25,219
lt would be like cutting off
my own leg.t

548
01:33:27,310 --> 01:33:29,220
Did you feel pain
when you broke through the door?

549
01:33:30,069 --> 01:33:31,742
Pain? Of course!o

550
01:33:32,590 --> 01:33:35,546
So if l ever catch you
attempting anything on her...

551
01:33:35,747 --> 01:33:43,064
You're very lucky to have established
an emotional contact with them.

552
01:33:43,788 --> 01:33:44,743
lt may feel pleasant, but...t

553
01:33:44,948 --> 01:33:48,305
- What? Are you envious?
- Perhaps.

554
01:33:48,630 --> 01:33:52,984
No, you can't feel any guilt,
the guilt is mine.

555
01:33:55,149 --> 01:33:58,778
When you have turned yourself
into a hopeless cripple,

556
01:33:59,469 --> 01:34:02,188
you can call on us.
We will empty your chamber pot.

557
01:34:02,948 --> 01:34:06,100
- Toward whom are you guilty?
- Toward you, among others.s

558
01:34:50,550 --> 01:34:53,506
My father shot most of the film.
l shot bits of it.

559
01:37:41,868 --> 01:37:42,823
Do you know...t

560
01:38:00,590 --> 01:38:04,868
l don't even know my own self.
Who am l?

561
01:38:07,149 --> 01:38:11,028
As soon as l close my eyes l can't
recall what my face is like.o

562
01:38:14,828 --> 01:38:15,863
Do you know who you are?t

563
01:38:16,788 --> 01:38:18,109
Yes, all humans do.g

564
01:38:28,149 --> 01:38:32,188
That woman in the white fur coat,
she hated me.

565
01:38:32,390 --> 01:38:36,176
That woman died long ago,
before we ever met.

566
01:38:38,469 --> 01:38:40,618
Stop fooling me.w

567
01:38:41,908 --> 01:38:45,185
l do remember that l came over
for tea,

568
01:38:46,590 --> 01:38:47,863
and she told me to leave the house.n

569
01:38:49,069 --> 01:38:51,582
So l left at once.
l remember it very well.

570
01:38:53,469 --> 01:38:54,948
What happened after that?

571
01:38:57,149 --> 01:39:01,823
After that, l went away. That was
the last time we ever saw each other.

572
01:39:03,029 --> 01:39:04,018
Where did you go?f

573
01:39:04,988 --> 01:39:06,024
To another city.
114
01:39:11,350 --> 01:39:13,579
- Why?
- l was transferred. 

574
01:39:10,630 --> 01:39:12,109
Why didn't you take me with you?o

575
01:39:15,069 --> 01:39:16,389
Because you refused to come. 

576
01:39:19,469 --> 01:39:20,948
Yes, l remember that.e

577
01:40:17,229 --> 01:40:21,140
Sorry, l thought
you were awake.t

578
01:40:21,469 --> 01:40:22,582
What's up?u

579
01:40:23,069 --> 01:40:24,787
The rate of regeneration has slowed.

580
01:40:25,469 --> 01:40:28,667
For two or three hours we can be rid
of our visitors.

581
01:40:29,149 --> 01:40:31,344
And you've come in the middle of
the night to tell me that?

582
01:40:32,788 --> 01:40:36,304
l'll tell you exactly
why l came.h

583
01:40:37,109 --> 01:40:40,783
We thought that since the oceane

584
01:40:41,069 --> 01:40:43,743
extracts our visitors from us
during our sleep,

585
01:40:44,390 --> 01:40:47,586
it might be in our interest to
communicate to it our waking thoughts.

586
01:40:47,868 --> 01:40:50,703
- Yes, but how?
- By X-rays.t

587
01:40:51,707 --> 01:40:55,020
Perhaps it will get the message and
spare us all these apparitions.

588
01:40:55,310 --> 01:40:58,823
Again your idiotic X-ray theories
about the greatness of science?

589
01:40:59,149 --> 01:41:02,823
We'll modulate the beam
with the brain waves of one of us.

590
01:41:03,109 --> 01:41:09,787
One of us means me, of course?
A transcription of my thoughts?

591
01:41:10,229 --> 01:41:13,188
What if l want her to die,
to disappear?

592
01:41:14,868 --> 01:41:17,462
Give everything back to that...
mass ofjelly?

593
01:41:18,229 --> 01:41:20,618
lt's already invaded my soul.

594
01:41:21,069 --> 01:41:26,587
Chris, we're losing time.
Sartorius has another project.

595
01:41:27,149 --> 01:41:31,666
The annihilator. To destroy
only neutrino systems.

596
01:41:33,948 --> 01:41:36,304
Blackmail? 

597
01:41:36,868 --> 01:41:39,828
l convinced him that we should
start with the encephalogram.

598
01:41:40,630 --> 01:41:44,176
And one more thing...
For now, forget all about it.

599
01:41:45,988 --> 01:41:49,426
Tomorrow's my birthday.
You're invited.c

600
01:41:50,069 --> 01:41:52,743
- You're trying to patch it up?
- Yes, l am.

601
01:41:52,948 --> 01:41:54,426
Not so loud, she's sleeping.r

602
01:41:58,509 --> 01:42:06,462
So she knows how to sleep already?
This is going to end badly.

603
01:42:07,390 --> 01:42:08,947
What do you propose then?.

604
01:42:09,149 --> 01:42:12,938
Nothing. So you'll come?
To the library tomorrow?

605
01:42:17,310 --> 01:42:24,180
We'll set up the table.
At least there are no windows there.

606
01:42:25,229 --> 01:42:28,984
ln the meantime let's go
and see Sartorius.

607
01:42:32,469 --> 01:42:35,461
She's sleeping.
Suppose that she follows us?

608
01:42:37,229 --> 01:42:39,104
Try leaving the door unlocked
this time.

609
01:42:42,509 --> 01:42:46,421
What door?
lt's just a mirage.

610
01:43:40,149 --> 01:43:41,104
l'll be right back. 

611
01:43:43,149 --> 01:43:44,104
Where are you going?

612
01:44:18,747 --> 01:44:21,024
Forgive me! 

613
01:45:15,630 --> 01:45:17,028
Why aren't you sleeping?w

614
01:45:21,630 --> 01:45:22,858
You don't love me. 

615
01:45:23,310 --> 01:45:24,425
Stop it.b

616
01:45:27,149 --> 01:45:29,743
- We have to talk.
- About what?h

617
01:45:31,390 --> 01:45:39,180
l don't know where l came from.
Do you know?t

618
01:45:39,390 --> 01:45:40,344
What are you talking about?c

619
01:45:40,590 --> 01:45:49,908
lf you do know, and you can't
tell me, for some reason,

620
01:45:50,868 --> 01:45:53,542
perhaps one day you will, Chris?e

621
01:45:54,550 --> 01:45:58,506
What are you talking about?
l don't understand anything.

622
01:46:00,229 --> 01:46:04,301
You won't tell, you're afraid to.

623
01:46:06,707 --> 01:46:08,381
So l'll have to tell you.l

624
01:46:10,868 --> 01:46:14,384
l'm not Hari.
Hari is dead...w

625
01:46:16,550 --> 01:46:17,618
She took poison.v

626
01:46:19,630 --> 01:46:22,018
And l'm someone else.o

627
01:46:22,630 --> 01:46:26,828
- Who've you been talking to?
- Sartorius told me.t

628
01:46:27,069 --> 01:46:28,024
When? Last night? 

629
01:46:31,988 --> 01:46:34,502
lt would've been less painful
if you'd told me yourself.

630
01:46:34,707 --> 01:46:37,018
Oh, my God! What's the difference? 

631
01:46:42,948 --> 01:46:44,542
How did you live all that time?o

632
01:46:46,310 --> 01:46:47,743
Were you in love with someone? 

633
01:46:49,707 --> 01:46:51,028
Did you ever think of me?f

634
01:46:51,988 --> 01:46:54,265
Sometimes, yes, not always. 

635
01:46:57,069 --> 01:46:58,627
Whenever l felt unhappy.l

636
01:47:05,390 --> 01:47:09,176
l think someone is playing a kind
of game with us

637
01:47:11,550 --> 01:47:13,505
And the more they play,i

638
01:47:14,149 --> 01:47:17,823
the worse it will be for you.s

639
01:47:20,550 --> 01:47:21,823
l wish l knew how to help you.
181
01:47:28,829 --> 01:47:35,349
The girl, the other one,
what happened to her?h

640
01:47:40,310 --> 01:47:45,506
We'd quarreled. Toward the end,
we used to quarrel a lot.

641
01:47:46,029 --> 01:47:48,259
l packed my things and left her.r

642
01:47:50,149 --> 01:47:53,140
She made me understand...
She didn't say it in so many words...

643
01:47:54,149 --> 01:47:57,663
When you've lived with a person long
enough, words aren't necessary.

644
01:47:59,707 --> 01:48:01,541
l didn't think it was so serious,n

645
01:48:01,788 --> 01:48:08,661
but then l remembered that l'd
left the laboratory preparationsa

646
01:48:10,948 --> 01:48:14,658
in the fridge, having explained
to her their effect.l

647
01:48:14,868 --> 01:48:18,179
l got scared and wanted to go to her,t

648
01:48:19,550 --> 01:48:22,779
but then l thought she'd understand
that l took her words seriously.

649
01:48:23,550 --> 01:48:26,063
On the third day l did go to her
after all.

650
01:48:26,707 --> 01:48:31,578
She was already dead. There was
an injection mark on her arm.

651
01:48:35,469 --> 01:48:36,505
Like this?e

652
01:48:45,509 --> 01:48:47,578
Why do you think she did that?r

653
01:48:49,069 --> 01:48:52,948
l believe she felt
that l didn't love her anymore.

654
01:48:57,350 --> 01:48:58,304
But l love you. 

655
01:49:10,667 --> 01:49:14,707
Chris! l love you so much.t

656
01:49:20,550 --> 01:49:22,505
Go to sleep.n

657
01:49:22,868 --> 01:49:24,063
l don't know how to sleep.

658
01:49:26,429 --> 01:49:30,944
lt seems like sleep, but it's not.
lt's like a sleep within a sleep.

659
01:49:33,948 --> 01:49:37,862
lt doesn't come from inside me.
lt's from far away.t

660
01:49:39,310 --> 01:49:42,746
lt's still a kind of sleep.

661
01:50:22,069 --> 01:50:25,027
l guess our hero
is not going to show up.

662
01:50:29,390 --> 01:50:31,948
- Why?
- Perhaps he's having guests. 

663
01:51:26,229 --> 01:51:28,060
Oh, everybody's here!g

664
01:51:32,069 --> 01:51:34,265
You're one and a half hour late.

665
01:51:41,350 --> 01:51:43,341
What is that you're reading?n

666
01:51:49,270 --> 01:51:50,622
This is all rubbish! 

667
01:51:57,069 --> 01:51:58,104
Where did l put it... 

668
01:52:00,469 --> 01:52:04,826
Where the devil... Here!d

669
01:52:09,189 --> 01:52:11,259
They come at night,u

670
01:52:13,547 --> 01:52:15,823
but a man needs his nights
for sleeping.

671
01:52:17,828 --> 01:52:23,938
That's our problem.
Man has lost the gift of sleep.

672
01:52:30,547 --> 01:52:34,904
You'd better read it. l'm a bit
overexcited.

673
01:52:37,710 --> 01:52:40,542
''Senor, l know only one thing.
When l...n

674
01:52:51,587 --> 01:52:53,180
When l sleep,
l know no fear,
217
01:52:57,390 --> 01:52:59,426
no hope,
no work, no blessing...
218
01:52:59,870 --> 01:

675
01:53:03,627 --> 01:53:07,259
equals the shepherd with the king,
and the simple with the wise.

676
01:53:07,948 --> 01:53:12,944
Sound sleep has but one defect -
it smacks too much of death.

677
01:53:13,627 --> 01:53:17,908
Never before, Sancho, have you
pronounced such a gracious speech.''

678
01:53:21,149 --> 01:53:25,826
That's great. Now perhaps you'll
let me inject a few words of my own?

679
01:53:26,948 --> 01:53:29,417
l propose a toast to Snout,e

680
01:53:30,229 --> 01:53:34,268
to his courage,
and his devotion to duty. 

681
01:53:34,908 --> 01:53:37,104
Here's to science, and to Snout!e

682
01:53:37,868 --> 01:53:40,429
To science? lt's a fraud!

683
01:53:42,270 --> 01:53:47,390
No one will ever resolve this
problem, neither genius, nor idiot!

684
01:53:48,908 --> 01:53:53,779
We have no ambition
to conquer any cosmos.

685
01:53:54,948 --> 01:53:57,942
We just want to extend Earth
up to the Cosmos's borders.

686
01:53:59,429 --> 01:54:03,661
We don't want any more worlds.

687
01:54:04,627 --> 01:54:06,585
Only a mirror to see our own in.

688
01:54:07,710 --> 01:54:11,179
We try so hard to make contact,
but we're doomed to failure. 

689
01:54:12,029 --> 01:54:16,020
We look ridiculous
pursuing a goal we fear

690
01:54:16,229 --> 01:54:19,779
and that we really don't need.

691
01:54:21,469 --> 01:54:24,826
Man needs man!

692
01:54:32,627 --> 01:54:36,179
Let's drink to Guibariane.
ln memory of a man.

693
01:54:36,750 --> 01:54:39,104
Though what he did, was out of fear.m

694
01:54:52,069 --> 01:54:54,140
No, Guibariane was not afraid.f

695
01:54:57,868 --> 01:54:59,587
There are worse things than
being afraid.

696
01:55:02,627 --> 01:55:05,143
He died because he saw no way out.u

697
01:55:07,627 --> 01:55:10,506
He thought that what was happening,
was happening only to him.

698
01:55:11,069 --> 01:55:17,542
All that heart-breaking moaning
is just second-rate Dostoyevsky.

699
01:55:18,710 --> 01:55:20,345
Who do you think you are
to judge us?t

700
01:55:20,547 --> 01:55:22,618
At least l know why l'm here.

701
01:55:24,109 --> 01:55:26,337
Nature created man
so that he might gain knowledge.

702
01:55:28,547 --> 01:55:31,667
ln his march toward the truth,
man is condemned to knowledge.

703
01:55:32,587 --> 01:55:33,703
The rest is of no consequence.

704
01:55:36,149 --> 01:55:40,381
lf you will permit me to inquire,
what exactly are you doing on Solaris?

705
01:55:42,069 --> 01:55:43,024
What a question!d

706
01:55:43,469 --> 01:55:50,069
Except for your tryst with your ex,
nothing here seems to interest you.

707
01:55:50,948 --> 01:55:53,747
Your time is spent
lolling in bed day after day.a

708
01:55:54,310 --> 01:55:56,377
ls that how you understand
your duty?e

709
01:55:57,149 --> 01:56:01,188
You've lost contact with reality.
lf you ask me, you're plain lazy.

710
01:56:02,270 --> 01:56:03,304
Stop it!'

711
01:56:04,149 --> 01:56:09,270
- Let's drink to Guibariane.
- No, to Man!

712
01:56:09,547 --> 01:56:11,663
Are you suggesting
he was not a man?

713
01:56:11,868 --> 01:56:14,828
Stop it, Chris!
We'd better not quarrel.o

714
01:56:15,469 --> 01:56:19,779
After all, today is my birthday.
259
01:56:24,150 --> 01:56:32,899
l think Chris is more logical
than both of you.

715
01:56:29,828 --> 01:56:32,819
ln these inhuman conditions
he alone acted human.

716
01:56:33,029 --> 01:56:36,225
While you two pretend
that it doesn't concern you,

717
01:56:36,429 --> 01:56:42,027
and that your visitors
are just an exterior enemy.a

718
01:56:42,788 --> 01:56:47,703
But your visitors are part of you,
they are your conscience.l

719
01:56:51,988 --> 01:56:53,261
l believe Chris loves me,?

720
01:56:57,310 --> 01:57:03,942
but perhaps he doesn't really,
perhaps he just defends himself.

721
01:57:05,429 --> 01:57:06,987
By me, who is alive, he wants...d

722
01:57:08,750 --> 01:57:12,024
No, that's not the point.
lt doesn't matter why a human loves.

723
01:57:13,547 --> 01:57:15,301
No, it isn't Chris,a

724
01:57:16,509 --> 01:57:19,819
it's you... l hate you all!n

725
01:57:21,189 --> 01:57:23,942
Don't interrupt me.
l'm a woman after all!e

726
01:57:24,429 --> 01:57:26,578
Woman? You're not even a human being.s

727
01:57:26,788 --> 01:57:31,020
Try to understand that, if you're
capable of understanding anything!

728
01:57:33,627 --> 01:57:36,189
Hari doesn't exist! She's dead!g

729
01:57:39,627 --> 01:57:42,542
You're only a reproduction,o

730
01:57:43,547 --> 01:57:48,259
a mechanical repetition of the form!
A copy from a matrix!

731
01:57:57,390 --> 01:58:01,939
Yes, perhaps. 

732
01:58:11,627 --> 01:58:16,384
But l...l'm becoming a human being!r

733
01:58:20,509 --> 01:58:22,658
l can feel just as deeply as any
of you.y

734
01:58:29,029 --> 01:58:30,621
l can live without Chris already.,

735
01:58:33,429 --> 01:58:38,547
l... l'm in love with him.

736
01:58:41,788 --> 01:58:42,938
l'm a human being!u

737
01:58:44,627 --> 01:58:48,587
You, why are you so cruel...

738
01:59:42,149 --> 01:59:44,457
Get up, on your feet!

739
01:59:52,627 --> 01:59:53,904
My dear man!,

740
01:59:59,788 --> 02:00:01,462
Nothing is more easy.s

741
02:00:06,229 --> 02:00:07,902
lt's wrong of us to quarrel like this.p

742
02:00:09,469 --> 02:00:13,509
We lose our humanity,
our dignity as humans.i

743
02:00:14,670 --> 02:00:19,902
No, you're very human,
but each one in his own way.h

744
02:00:21,788 --> 02:00:23,426
That's why you're quarrelling.t

745
02:00:25,587 --> 02:00:26,658
l hope l'm not bothering you?e

746
02:00:31,509 --> 02:00:36,140
You're really a good fellow.
Only you look awful!

747
02:00:44,469 --> 02:00:50,145
Actually, l'm worn out.
Could you help me?t

748
02:00:54,788 --> 02:00:59,420
Doesn't a man who'd give up
his life 

749
02:00:59,710 --> 02:01:06,261
for some silly damned contact,
for knowing the truth about it,

750
02:01:06,469 --> 02:01:07,662
doesn't he have a right to get drunk
once in a while?t

751
02:01:08,109 --> 02:01:11,067
Certainly he has, absolutely.w

752
02:01:13,029 --> 02:01:16,225
Tell me, do you believe in our
mission?

753
02:01:18,189 --> 02:01:21,625
l'll stay up a while yet.
lt's important we don't sleep.

754
02:01:23,149 --> 02:01:25,104
l'm going to see Faust in his
laboratory.d

755
02:01:26,788 --> 02:01:33,136
Our Faust, Sartorius, is still seeking
his remedy against immortality.

756
02:01:33,627 --> 02:01:34,585
While we...o

757
02:01:48,069 --> 02:01:52,904
Suppose we opened all the windows
and yelled down as loud as we could?

758
02:01:53,710 --> 02:01:55,268
Do you think it would hear?

759
02:01:56,390 --> 02:01:59,301
Only who shall we call to?a

760
02:02:01,469 --> 02:02:05,826
Maybe we should whip him
with birch leaves?d

761
02:02:07,149 --> 02:02:09,297
Or we could even pray to it...o

762
02:02:09,948 --> 02:02:10,904
What's the matter?g

763
02:02:11,109 --> 02:02:13,670
l think l closed the door...
She's alone there.

764
02:02:13,868 --> 02:02:17,942
Go on. l feel a lot better.
The station changes its orbit.

765
02:02:19,069 --> 02:02:23,698
At 1 7 hours there'll be
thirty seconds of weightlessness.

766
02:02:24,788 --> 02:02:26,268
So don't forget.h

767
02:05:38,029 --> 02:05:38,984
Hari!p

768
02:05:41,149 --> 02:05:43,297
Forgive me, darling, l was lost
in my thoughts.

769
02:05:46,029 --> 02:05:47,256
ls anything wrong?

770
02:05:49,149 --> 02:05:54,304
No. No, nothing's wrong.
Everything's all right.

771
02:09:38,469 --> 02:09:39,902
She drank liquid oxygen...

772
02:09:42,587 --> 02:09:44,306
She did it out of desperation.o

773
02:09:45,390 --> 02:09:46,979
lt is going to get worse.e

774
02:09:47,390 --> 02:09:52,667
The more she's with you,
the more human she becomes.

775
02:09:59,069 --> 02:10:03,938
- What are you going to do?
- Wait until she comes back.

776
02:10:04,229 --> 02:10:06,697
And then what?
Leave the station?h

777
02:10:11,469 --> 02:10:16,100
Chris, she can live only here,
on the station.

778
02:10:18,189 --> 02:10:21,819
What else can l do?
l love her.
324
02:10:26,029 --> 02:10:28,908
Love whom? Her?
Or the girl on the rocket?m

779
02:10:25,948 --> 02:10:29,908
She will return. She can
return a hundred times over.

780
02:10:31,109 --> 02:10:33,987
Don't convert the scientific problem
to an insignificant love story.

781
02:10:38,469 --> 02:10:40,984
l had a foreboding
that this would end badly.a

782
02:10:45,547 --> 02:10:47,185
You should help her.a

783
02:11:03,627 --> 02:11:05,029
lt's horrifying, isn't it?

784
02:11:07,069 --> 02:11:11,663
l'll never get used
to these constant resurrections!

785
02:13:00,270 --> 02:13:01,225
ls it me?.

786
02:13:08,390 --> 02:13:11,538
What?.. What?..t

787
02:13:14,069 --> 02:13:19,143
Why? Why?'

788
02:13:23,189 --> 02:13:25,497
No... l'm not... 

789
02:13:30,429 --> 02:13:32,420
Not her... Not Hari...t

790
02:13:32,788 --> 02:13:36,942
And you... What if you aren't either...

791
02:13:37,868 --> 02:13:40,020
- Don't talk, Hari.
- l'm not Hari!o

792
02:13:43,149 --> 02:13:46,585
Maybe your appearanceN

793
02:13:46,908 --> 02:13:49,140
is supposed to be a torment,
maybe the ocean sent you.

794
02:13:49,788 --> 02:13:56,024
But you're more to me than
all that science could ever mean!

795
02:13:57,788 --> 02:14:01,828
- Do l look very much like her?
- You may have looked like her.

796
02:14:02,627 --> 02:14:05,189
But now it's you who are real Hari.

797
02:14:06,069 --> 02:14:08,344
Tell me...G

798
02:14:09,310 --> 02:14:13,018
Do l look ugly? Can you look at me?

799
02:14:17,948 --> 02:14:20,622
- Do l disgust you?
- No.

800
02:14:20,828 --> 02:14:23,024
- You're lying!
- Stop it!l

801
02:14:23,229 --> 02:14:24,707
l must be looking disgusting!t

802
02:14:32,229 --> 02:14:33,265
Don't touch me!n

803
02:15:21,310 --> 02:15:22,707
l love you!o

804
02:15:24,948 --> 02:15:28,386
Hari, what can l do?t

805
02:15:33,270 --> 02:15:36,341
Nothing...n

806
02:15:42,229 --> 02:15:43,627
l won't return to earth.

807
02:15:45,229 --> 02:15:48,618
We'll live here,
on the station.a

808
02:15:55,229 --> 02:15:56,547
l'm afraid.t

809
02:18:00,629 --> 02:18:05,145
The ocean's activity is increasing.
Your encephalogram may be the cause.

810
02:18:07,190 --> 02:18:12,863
Whenever we show pity we empty
our souls.

811
02:18:13,388 --> 02:18:14,868
Perhaps that's true.t

812
02:18:16,227 --> 02:18:22,415
Suffering makes life
seem gray and suspicious.

813
02:18:26,949 --> 02:18:33,943
No, l don't believe that...
l will not accept that...

814
02:18:39,870 --> 02:18:44,656
What is not indispensable to life
is in some way harmful to it?

815
02:18:45,066 --> 02:18:50,781
No, that's not true either.
ltjust isn't true!o

816
02:18:52,308 --> 02:18:53,583
Remember Tolstoy's suffering

817
02:18:55,148 --> 02:18:59,143
about the impossibility
of loving the humankind in general?

818
02:19:02,670 --> 02:19:04,625
How much time has passed since?t

819
02:19:06,148 --> 02:19:09,745
l can't figure it out...
Help me.y

820
02:19:12,709 --> 02:19:13,934
Let's suppose l love you.r

821
02:19:14,629 --> 02:19:18,415
Love is something
we can feel,a

822
02:19:18,629 --> 02:19:22,861
but never explain.
One can only explain the idea.

823
02:19:23,670 --> 02:19:25,941
You love that
which you can lose.
370
02:19:30,629 --> 02:19:33,427Yourself, a woman, your country...


824
02:19:30,790 --> 02:19:36,977
Until today, humanity, the world,
had no way to reach love.

825
02:19:37,870 --> 02:19:41,656
There are so few of us!m

826
02:19:43,629 --> 02:19:45,745
Perhaps the reason we're here,u

827
02:19:46,468 --> 02:19:49,745
is to understand, for the first time,
human beings as a reason to love?

828
02:19:55,308 --> 02:19:56,708
He's feverish.l

829
02:19:58,870 --> 02:20:02,826
How did Guibariane really die?
You haven't told me.

830
02:20:03,870 --> 02:20:05,505
l'll tell you, but later..

831
02:20:07,109 --> 02:20:10,816
Guibariane did not die out of fear,
he died out of shame.

832
02:20:11,388 --> 02:20:15,620
The salvation of humanity is
in its shame!

833
02:22:37,870 --> 02:22:38,904
Mama, l...h

834
02:22:42,949 --> 02:22:44,781
l'm two hours late.

835
02:22:45,308 --> 02:22:48,904
l know. How was your trip? 

836
02:22:50,148 --> 02:22:55,270
lt was just a bit tiring.
lt was all right.t

837
02:23:10,549 --> 02:23:16,737
lt's running slow again.
l'll set it right.

838
02:23:17,148 --> 02:23:18,299
You have lots of time.r

839
02:23:45,907 --> 02:23:49,263
l don't know what's the matter
with me...b

840
02:23:53,429 --> 02:23:55,621
l have completely forgotten your face.

841
02:23:57,227 --> 02:24:02,020
You don't look well.
Are you happy?n

842
02:24:02,227 --> 02:24:05,665
Happiness is an idea that's obsolete.o

843
02:24:07,548 --> 02:24:10,299
l think that's too bad.d

844
02:24:14,869 --> 02:24:16,665
l feel so alone now.i

845
02:24:29,629 --> 02:24:31,029
Why are you hurting us?.

846
02:24:32,270 --> 02:24:36,502
What have you been waiting for?
You might have telephoned.

847
02:24:54,988 --> 02:24:57,138
You seem to lead
such a strange life.

848
02:24:58,509 --> 02:25:01,022
You're sloppy, you don't take
care of yourself.

849
02:25:03,388 --> 02:25:04,902
How did you get into this state?.

850
02:25:10,746 --> 02:25:15,777
What's this? Wait, l'll be
right back.u

851
02:26:51,789 --> 02:26:53,109
Hari...r

852
02:27:09,110 --> 02:27:11,336
How are you? You feel better now?

853
02:27:12,270 --> 02:27:13,667
Where's Hari? 

854
02:27:25,227 --> 02:27:28,299
- What is it?
- There is no more Hari.

855
02:27:52,509 --> 02:27:56,738
''Chris, l'm sorry l had
to deceive you.

856
02:27:57,586 --> 02:27:59,702
There wasn't any other way.
404
02:28:05,548 --> 02:28:07,825
This is the only solution for us both.o

857
02:28:09,709 --> 02:28:11,665
l asked them myself. lt was my
decision.

858
02:28:13,586 --> 02:28:19,504
Do not blame anyone for this. Hari.''

859
02:28:24,789 --> 02:28:26,825
She did it for you.e

860
02:28:37,110 --> 02:28:39,667
Snout, listen...

861
02:28:41,110 --> 02:28:43,066
Calm down, Chris.n

862
02:28:44,110 --> 02:28:47,102
How was it?..h

863
02:28:48,869 --> 02:28:51,745
The annihilator. An explosion of
light, and a breath of wind.

864
02:29:01,429 --> 02:29:06,709
To think that we quarreled so often
those last days.

865
02:29:12,148 --> 02:29:17,018
Snout, why are we being
tortured like this?

866
02:29:19,950 --> 02:29:23,987
We have lost our sense of the Cosmic.

867
02:29:24,746 --> 02:29:30,059
Ancient man had no such problem.
He'd have never asked why...

868
02:29:31,030 --> 02:29:32,700
You remember the myth of Sisyphus?y

869
02:29:35,227 --> 02:29:38,104
Since we sent your encephalogram,u

870
02:29:38,468 --> 02:29:41,139
not a single one of the visitors
has returned.f

871
02:29:42,110 --> 02:29:45,466
Something beyond our understanding
is happening to the ocean.

872
02:29:45,988 --> 02:29:48,183
lslands have begun
to form on the surface.

873
02:29:48,667 --> 02:29:51,863
First there was one,
then others began to appear.

874
02:29:52,388 --> 02:29:55,109
Are you telling me that
we were understood?

875
02:29:55,629 --> 02:29:57,584
Just like that? ln one stroke?

876
02:29:58,789 --> 02:30:03,021
At least we can hope now.p

877
02:30:10,388 --> 02:30:13,029
- How old are you?
- Fifty two.

878
02:30:14,869 --> 02:30:15,905
Have you been here long?

879
02:30:18,110 --> 02:30:20,066
You must have read my background
papers.

880
02:30:22,388 --> 02:30:26,941
After so many years
on the station,d

881
02:30:28,789 --> 02:30:32,667
do you still feel as clearly your
link with the life down below?

882
02:30:33,548 --> 02:30:39,182
l suppose next you'll want to know
what life's all about, eh?

883
02:30:39,869 --> 02:30:41,940
Please, let's not be ironical.

884
02:30:42,468 --> 02:30:49,182
When a man is happy,
the meaning of life

885
02:30:49,468 --> 02:30:52,584
and other themes of eternity
rarely interest him.e

886
02:30:54,388 --> 02:30:57,700
These questions should be asked
at the end of one's life.

887
02:31:02,350 --> 02:31:07,263
We don't know when our life will end,
that's why we're in a hurry.

888
02:31:08,270 --> 02:31:11,657
The happiest people are those

889
02:31:11,869 --> 02:31:15,496
who never bother asking
those cursed questions.

890
02:31:15,869 --> 02:31:17,825
We question life
to seek out some meaning.

891
02:31:18,709 --> 02:31:22,304
Yet to preserve all the simple
human truths we need mysteries.

892
02:31:23,067 --> 02:31:26,504
The mystery of happiness, death,
love.

893
02:31:27,067 --> 02:31:30,584
You may be right.
But try not to think about it.

894
02:31:32,067 --> 02:31:36,184
To think about it is the same
as to know the day of one's death.

895
02:31:38,667 --> 02:31:42,218
Not knowing that date
makes us practically immortal.

896
02:31:48,030 --> 02:31:52,182
Well, anyway, my mission is finished.

897
02:31:53,110 --> 02:31:56,066
And what next?
To return to earth?f

898
02:31:57,548 --> 02:31:58,979
Little by little, everything
will come to normal.

899
02:31:59,190 --> 02:32:01,827
l'll find new interests,
new acquaintances. 

900
02:32:03,388 --> 02:32:07,425
But l won't be able to devote
all of myself to them.

901
02:32:10,950 --> 02:32:12,585
And do l have the right to turn down

902
02:32:13,388 --> 02:32:17,860
even an imaginary possibility
of contact with the ocean,

903
02:32:18,827 --> 02:32:22,869
to which my race is trying
to stretch a thread of understanding?

904
02:32:24,388 --> 02:32:30,656
To stay here, among the things
we both touched,t

905
02:32:30,950 --> 02:32:32,745
which still remember our breathing?e

906
02:32:33,709 --> 02:32:37,620
What for?
Just for the hope of her return?

907
02:32:38,548 --> 02:32:40,744
But l have no hope.a

908
02:32:42,709 --> 02:32:45,345
The only thing left for me
is to wait.

909
02:32:46,548 --> 02:32:51,461
Wait for what?
l don't know... A new miracle.

910
02:32:58,148 --> 02:32:59,102
Are you all right now?u

911
02:33:00,388 --> 02:33:03,220
Yes, l feel fine.a

912
02:33:03,629 --> 02:33:07,826
ln my opinion, it's time for you
to return to earth.

913
02:33:09,950 --> 02:33:11,065
ls that your opinion?n

914
02:39:15,148 --> 02:39:22,181
The End
