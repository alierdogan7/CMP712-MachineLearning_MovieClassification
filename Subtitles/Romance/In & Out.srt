I don't know why he said it.

363
00:19:55,808 --> 00:19:57,401
I've been trying
to figure that out.

364
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:59,993
That's not why we're here today.

365
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:02,366
- Mr. Brackett.
- Mike?

366
00:20:03,392 --> 00:20:06,076
MIKE: I've been thinking
about it all night.

367
00:20:06,112 --> 00:20:09,276
Why would he say you were gay?
I got it figured out.

368
00:20:10,528 --> 00:20:11,772
What have you got?

369
00:20:11,808 --> 00:20:12,888
Look at you.

370
00:20:12,928 --> 00:20:14,335
HOWARD: I beg your pardon?

371
00:20:14,368 --> 00:20:16,789
MIKE: No offense,
but you're an English teacher.

372
00:20:16,832 --> 00:20:17,945
VICKY: Exactly.

373
00:20:17,984 --> 00:20:21,115
All this poetry and odes
and bonnets.

374
00:20:21,152 --> 00:20:22,428
Sonnets?

375
00:20:22,464 --> 00:20:23,925
And you're kinda prissy.

376
00:20:23,968 --> 00:20:25,462
HOWARD: Prissy?

377
00:20:25,504 --> 00:20:28,820
MIKE: Not in a bad way.
I mean you're smart.

378
00:20:28,864 --> 00:20:30,009
JACK: Well-dressed.

379
00:20:30,048 --> 00:20:31,128
MEREDITH: And really clean.

380
00:20:31,168 --> 00:20:32,412
MIKE: Doesn't look good.

381
00:20:32,448 --> 00:20:35,928
Plus, you got the drama club,
and you ride that bicycle.

382
00:20:35,968 --> 00:20:39,383
You've been engaged to
Miss Montgomery for three years.

383
00:20:39,424 --> 00:20:40,634
HOWARD: What does that...

384
00:20:40,672 --> 00:20:44,382
Think about it. You add it up,
of course he thinks you're gay!

385
00:20:44,416 --> 00:20:50,167
Ooh! Ooh! Ooh!
Plus, he was in that movie...

386
00:20:50,208 --> 00:20:53,591
so his brain is, like,
already going that way...

387
00:20:53,632 --> 00:20:56,479
and then he remembers you...

388
00:20:56,512 --> 00:21:00,309
and he goes, "Smart, clean,
totally decent human being...

389
00:21:00,352 --> 00:21:01,464
"gay!"

390
00:21:03,392 --> 00:21:05,432
[Reporters shouting]

391
00:21:05,472 --> 00:21:06,846
MAN: Gays in the space program?

392
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:08,822
WOMAN: Lesbians on Mars?

393
00:21:08,864 --> 00:21:10,904
TOM HALLIWELL: Excuse me.

394
00:21:12,448 --> 00:21:15,350
Mr... Mr. Brackett.
Boys and girls.

395
00:21:15,392 --> 00:21:16,505
Mr. Halliwell.

396
00:21:16,544 --> 00:21:18,399
Howard, could, uh, could I...

397
00:21:18,432 --> 00:21:21,181
HOWARD: Oh.
Class, excuse me.

398
00:21:21,216 --> 00:21:22,809
HALLIWELL:
The school is surrounded.

399
00:21:22,848 --> 00:21:24,255
There are TV cameras, reporters.

400
00:21:24,288 --> 00:21:26,589
MIKE: See? They want pictures
of the gay guy!

401
00:21:26,624 --> 00:21:28,118
[Class giggling]

402
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:32,313
HALLIWELL:
I tried to reason with them.

403
00:21:32,352 --> 00:21:34,262
I told them I was
the principal, and they...

404
00:21:35,199 --> 00:21:36,988
they mocked me.

405
00:21:37,024 --> 00:21:38,136
HOWARD: I'm sorry.

406
00:21:38,176 --> 00:21:40,565
HALLIWELL:
Could you talk to them?

407
00:21:40,608 --> 00:21:41,851
HOWARD: Right away.

408
00:21:42,848 --> 00:21:44,408
Class, page 58.

409
00:21:44,448 --> 00:21:46,335
HALLIWELL: Learn all you can.

410
00:21:46,368 --> 00:21:48,058
- Mr. Brackett.
- Yes?

411
00:21:48,832 --> 00:21:50,010
MIKE: Watch the hands.

412
00:21:50,048 --> 00:21:52,918
HALLIWELL:
Uh, good point.

413
00:21:54,368 --> 00:21:56,888
WOMAN: Howard, are you gay?

414
00:21:56,928 --> 00:21:58,967
CROWD: Howard! Howard, please!

415
00:21:59,008 --> 00:22:01,691
ED: I'm sorry.
The jury's still out on this.

416
00:22:01,728 --> 00:22:04,248
AVA: No way. He's been here
for how many years?

417
00:22:04,288 --> 00:22:06,230
TRINA: Come on. I always knew.

418
00:22:06,272 --> 00:22:08,891
AVA: I say bravo.
It's a blow for freedom.

419
00:22:08,928 --> 00:22:11,448
ED: Good for Howard.
To quote Mr. Bob Dylan...

420
00:22:11,488 --> 00:22:13,822
"How many roads
must a man walk down...

421
00:22:13,856 --> 00:22:15,382
"before we call him a man?"

422
00:22:15,424 --> 00:22:16,667
TRINA: Ed, don't. It's early.

423
00:22:16,704 --> 00:22:18,297
CARL: Knew what?

424
00:22:18,336 --> 00:22:21,053
ED: [Singing] And how many
seas must the white dove...

425
00:22:21,088 --> 00:22:23,641
- Ed, please.
- Before she sleeps...

426
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:24,924
- Shut up, Ed!
- Trina.

427
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:26,487
We're talking about Howard.

428
00:22:26,528 --> 00:22:28,317
CARL: Why are we
talking about Howard?

429
00:22:28,959 --> 00:22:30,869
AVA: 'Cause he likes dick.

430
00:22:32,448 --> 00:22:33,789
[Door opens]

431
00:22:34,784 --> 00:22:37,239
EMILY: Good morning, everyone.
How are you?

432
00:22:37,952 --> 00:22:40,538
- Hey! Terrific!
- Fabulous.

433
00:22:40,576 --> 00:22:43,195
WOMAN: Is that Xerox
still on the fritz?

434
00:22:43,232 --> 00:22:45,304
- How are you, sunshine?
- Oh, fine.

435
00:22:45,344 --> 00:22:47,231
AVA: Oh, look at you.

436
00:22:47,264 --> 00:22:49,052
CARL: Dick who?

437
00:22:49,088 --> 00:22:49,408
MIKE: He's getting married
this week.

438
00:22:49,408 --> 00:22:51,710
MIKE: He's getting married
this week.

439
00:22:51,744 --> 00:22:54,232
JACK: See? He's not gay.
I told you.

440
00:22:54,272 --> 00:22:56,541
MIKE: But think about it.
I mean, gay guys.

441
00:22:56,576 --> 00:22:57,918
BO Y: I don't wanna
think about it.

442
00:22:57,952 --> 00:23:01,149
MIKE: There's only two times
where it's OKto do gay stuff.

443
00:23:01,184 --> 00:23:03,159
Two emergency situations.

444
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:04,444
JACK: What? Which situations?

445
00:23:04,479 --> 00:23:07,578
MIKE: Prison, when it's
a substitute, or guys in space.

446
00:23:07,616 --> 00:23:08,728
JACK: Guys in space?

447
00:23:08,768 --> 00:23:10,175
MIKE: Not on purpose.

448
00:23:10,208 --> 00:23:12,696
It just happens
because they're weightless...

449
00:23:12,736 --> 00:23:15,551
and they float into each other
when they're asleep.

450
00:23:17,696 --> 00:23:19,289
JACK: You're so lame.

451
00:23:19,328 --> 00:23:21,663
MIKE: I know it's wrong.

452
00:23:21,696 --> 00:23:24,598
It's against, like, nature.
Basic plumbing.

453
00:23:24,639 --> 00:23:25,719
JACK: What?

454
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:27,483
MIKE: It's the human body.

455
00:23:27,519 --> 00:23:30,836
It's divided up
into in-holes and out-holes.

456
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:34,196
Stuff is supposed to go in the
in-holes and out the out-holes.

457
00:23:34,239 --> 00:23:38,746
But gay guys, they put stuff
in the out-holes.

458
00:23:39,744 --> 00:23:42,712
BO Y: Wait.
So is your mouth an in-hole?

459
00:23:42,752 --> 00:23:46,134
MIKE: Right. 'Cause you put
burgers in it and brew.

460
00:23:46,176 --> 00:23:47,899
Unless you're sick, and puke.

461
00:23:47,936 --> 00:23:50,008
Then it's an out-hole,
so it's wrong.

462
00:23:54,304 --> 00:23:56,278
Guys, come on! Hustle!

463
00:23:56,319 --> 00:23:58,392
You'll be late for class.
Let's go!

464
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,178
What's going on?

465
00:24:02,592 --> 00:24:06,007
MIKE: Mr. Brackett,
could you, like, excuse us?

466
00:24:06,048 --> 00:24:07,510
Why?

467
00:24:07,552 --> 00:24:10,301
Mike's being a jerk.

468
00:24:10,336 --> 00:24:13,718
MIKE: No. Just until
we're dressed and ready.

469
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:17,371
This has nothing to do
with the Oscars, does it?

470
00:24:17,408 --> 00:24:19,896
MIKE: No. Come on.

471
00:24:21,088 --> 00:24:22,495
What is it, then?

472
00:24:23,232 --> 00:24:25,720
Before the Oscars,
it was different.

473
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:27,037
I mean, you weren't...

474
00:24:28,832 --> 00:24:29,944
I wasn't what?

475
00:24:32,768 --> 00:24:34,044
Famous.

476
00:24:40,768 --> 00:24:42,459
You guys.

477
00:25:01,344 --> 00:25:03,286
PETER: Peter Malloy, network.

478
00:25:03,328 --> 00:25:05,717
HOWARD: No, no, no.
No more interviews.

479
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:08,891
I have nothing to say.
I have no comments.

480
00:25:08,928 --> 00:25:10,935
I have no thoughts
on gay marriage...

481
00:25:10,976 --> 00:25:13,310
I didn't see "The Birdcage."
I'm having dinner.

482
00:25:13,344 --> 00:25:15,799
PETER: Of course. I'm sorry.

483
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:17,815
HOWARD: You should be.
Why are you sitting?

484
00:25:17,856 --> 00:25:19,929
You people. Have some decency.

485
00:25:19,968 --> 00:25:23,263
You've been hounding me all day.
At my school, at my home.

486
00:25:23,296 --> 00:25:24,987
You should be ashamed
of yourselves.

487
00:25:25,024 --> 00:25:26,431
I am. Those leeches.

488
00:25:26,464 --> 00:25:28,830
They have no right
to pry into your life.

489
00:25:28,864 --> 00:25:30,009
They're sleazy.

490
00:25:30,048 --> 00:25:32,349
I don't know.
I like that Barbara Walters.

491
00:25:32,384 --> 00:25:34,398
Did Barbara call you?

492
00:25:34,526 --> 00:25:35,574
No.

493
00:25:38,142 --> 00:25:40,029
PETER: Howard.

494
00:25:40,062 --> 00:25:42,233
- Howard!
- No!

495
00:25:42,270 --> 00:25:43,382
PETER: Oh, Howard.

496
00:25:43,422 --> 00:25:46,270
HOWARD: Leave me alone,
you smut peddler!

497
00:25:46,302 --> 00:25:47,382
You professional gossip!

498
00:25:47,422 --> 00:25:49,015
PETER: Will you get real?

499
00:25:49,054 --> 00:25:50,777
HOWARD: Shh!

500
00:25:50,814 --> 00:25:52,188
- Look at me.
- Why?

501
00:25:52,222 --> 00:25:55,125
Sure, I look great,
but my ratings.

502
00:25:55,166 --> 00:25:58,744
Everyone wants to talk to
Diane Sawyer or Joan Lunden.

503
00:25:58,782 --> 00:26:01,564
My network's killing me.
They want me blond.

504
00:26:01,598 --> 00:26:02,678
With your coloring?

505
00:26:02,718 --> 00:26:05,817
All those reporters,
after today, they're gone.

506
00:26:05,854 --> 00:26:08,472
They've got their story.
But I care.

507
00:26:08,510 --> 00:26:10,452
I am doing a full week.

508
00:26:11,934 --> 00:26:13,363
A week? You can't.

509
00:26:13,406 --> 00:26:15,315
I have to. It's too good.

510
00:26:15,358 --> 00:26:17,879
No. I have classes to teach.
I'm getting married.

511
00:26:17,918 --> 00:26:19,805
- I'll be there.
- No.

512
00:26:19,838 --> 00:26:21,878
- I'll kill you.
- But it's classic.

513
00:26:21,918 --> 00:26:23,806
Sex, a small town,
and a movie star.

514
00:26:23,838 --> 00:26:25,399
Why can't you see that?

515
00:26:25,438 --> 00:26:28,220
"Howard Brackett: In and out."

516
00:26:29,182 --> 00:26:33,011
My God.
You are pure television.

517
00:26:33,054 --> 00:26:34,679
Stop it.

518
00:26:35,454 --> 00:26:36,599
Good night.

519
00:26:43,038 --> 00:26:45,209
[Laughter]

520
00:26:45,246 --> 00:26:46,326
WALTER: Guys, remember...

521
00:26:46,366 --> 00:26:47,992
- I got that.
- Thanks.

522
00:26:48,030 --> 00:26:51,958
WALTER: Don't say nothing about
the Oscars or Cameron Drake.

523
00:26:54,654 --> 00:26:56,083
MAN: I think he's coming.

524
00:27:01,854 --> 00:27:03,283
MAN: Shh. Shh.

525
00:27:08,318 --> 00:27:09,779
He's here!

526
00:27:09,822 --> 00:27:11,131
MEN: Yeah!

527
00:27:14,526 --> 00:27:17,210
HOWARD: Yeah, baby!

528
00:27:17,246 --> 00:27:19,701
Whoa! Are we gonna have
a bachelor party?

529
00:27:19,742 --> 00:27:20,822
MEN: Yes!

530
00:27:20,862 --> 00:27:22,804
- We gonna get down and dirty?
- Yes!

531
00:27:22,846 --> 00:27:24,853
HOWARD: Disgustingly drunk?

532
00:27:24,894 --> 00:27:25,974
MEN: Yeah!

533
00:27:26,014 --> 00:27:28,218
WALTER: We've been working
on this for weeks.

534
00:27:28,254 --> 00:27:30,872
We got all your favorite stuff,
everything you love!

535
00:27:30,910 --> 00:27:32,022
HOWARD: Hit me!

536
00:27:32,062 --> 00:27:33,851
WALTER: Here, Howard.

537
00:27:33,886 --> 00:27:36,089
HOWARD: What are we
talking about, triple X?

538
00:27:36,126 --> 00:27:38,297
Little Oral Annie? Traci Lords?

539
00:27:38,334 --> 00:27:39,741
Lay some adult video on me.

540
00:27:39,774 --> 00:27:41,661
ALDO: We got it... uncut.

541
00:27:41,694 --> 00:27:43,101
WALTER: "Funny Girl"!

542
00:27:43,134 --> 00:27:44,727
MEN: Yeah!

543
00:27:44,766 --> 00:27:46,773
[Wild laughter]

544
00:27:47,934 --> 00:27:49,243
"Funny Girl"?

545
00:27:49,278 --> 00:27:50,423
ALDO: Yeah.

546
00:27:50,462 --> 00:27:52,666
I don't believe this.
Barbra Streisand?

547
00:27:52,702 --> 00:27:54,393
MAN: You had that
film festival last year.

548
00:27:54,430 --> 00:27:56,885
- We watched all her movies.
- It was fun.

549
00:27:57,950 --> 00:28:00,317
HOWARD: Guys.
Guys, I'm truly offended.

550
00:28:00,350 --> 00:28:02,739
Don't you see
this is precisely the reason...

551
00:28:02,782 --> 00:28:04,888
why Cameron Drake
and half the civilized world...

552
00:28:04,926 --> 00:28:06,748
think that I'm... you know.

553
00:28:06,782 --> 00:28:07,862
MEN: No!

554
00:28:07,902 --> 00:28:08,982
Oh, no!

555
00:28:09,022 --> 00:28:10,331
ALDO: You're a guy's guy!

556
00:28:10,366 --> 00:28:11,511
MAN: No, no.

557
00:28:11,550 --> 00:28:13,273
HOWARD: I don't know
how this started...

558
00:28:13,310 --> 00:28:16,157
but this is my goddamn
bachelor party...

559
00:28:16,190 --> 00:28:18,394
and I am not going
to goddamn watch...

560
00:28:18,430 --> 00:28:21,245
pardon my split infinitive...
"Funny Girl"!

561
00:28:21,278 --> 00:28:23,831
- Me, neither. I hate that.
- Thank you.

562
00:28:23,870 --> 00:28:25,593
- You got "A Star is Born"?
- Oh, sure.

563
00:28:25,630 --> 00:28:26,742
HOWARD: "A Star is Born"?

564
00:28:26,782 --> 00:28:28,277
MAN: She looks bad in it.

565
00:28:28,318 --> 00:28:30,871
- "Yentl."
- "Yentl!"

566
00:28:30,910 --> 00:28:32,503
MAN: I'd watch it again.

567
00:28:32,542 --> 00:28:33,884
SECOND MAN: I love "Yentl"!

568
00:28:33,918 --> 00:28:35,827
Yeah! "Papa, can you hear me?"

569
00:28:35,870 --> 00:28:37,277
THIRD MAN:
Produced and directed.

570
00:28:37,310 --> 00:28:39,197
HOWARD: Dudes, hombres, guys!

571
00:28:39,230 --> 00:28:42,077
Guys, I'm sorry.
I am truly offended.

572
00:28:42,110 --> 00:28:45,143
I thought I knew you guys.
I thought you were studs.

573
00:28:47,646 --> 00:28:49,305
I guess I thought wrong.

574
00:28:49,342 --> 00:28:50,552
I'm out of here.

575
00:28:50,590 --> 00:28:51,735
WALTER: Howard.

576
00:28:51,774 --> 00:28:53,847
ALDO: Maybe he's right.
"Yentl" sucks.

577
00:28:55,614 --> 00:28:57,948
MEN: Ooh. Uh-oh.

578
00:28:58,910 --> 00:29:00,317
What did you say?

579
00:29:01,310 --> 00:29:02,935
ALDO: It sucks. It's boring.

580
00:29:07,710 --> 00:29:09,139
Say that again.

581
00:29:13,534 --> 00:29:16,916
She was too old for "Yentl"!

582
00:29:19,582 --> 00:29:20,989
[Everyone shouting]

583
00:29:37,854 --> 00:29:39,348
[Applause on TV]

584
00:29:39,390 --> 00:29:43,099
JAY LENO: I guess you heard...
Michael Jackson getting married.

585
00:29:43,134 --> 00:29:46,036
He's made the perfect choice...
Howard Brackett.

586
00:29:46,078 --> 00:29:47,256
Yes, Howard Brackett.

587
00:29:47,294 --> 00:29:48,887
[Laughter and applause]

588
00:29:50,686 --> 00:29:52,093
Peter Malloy with day two...

589
00:29:52,126 --> 00:29:53,948
of "Howard Brackett:
Will there be a wedding?"

590
00:29:53,982 --> 00:29:56,371
I'm with Aldo Hooper,
Howard's barber.

591
00:29:56,414 --> 00:29:58,967
Stylist... razor cuts,
color, full blow dry.

592
00:29:59,006 --> 00:30:00,183
That's very nice.

593
00:30:00,222 --> 00:30:02,807
What do you think?
Will there be a wedding?

594
00:30:02,846 --> 00:30:06,391
Howard is booked for Saturday.
A full styling. I say yes.

595
00:30:07,486 --> 00:30:09,820
Emmett Wilson, who has just
delivered Howard's mail...

596
00:30:09,854 --> 00:30:12,702
his intimate correspondence,
letters to a legend.

597
00:30:12,734 --> 00:30:14,141
Anything we should know?

598
00:30:14,174 --> 00:30:16,541
I can't reveal that.
I'm a postal employee.

599
00:30:16,574 --> 00:30:17,981
Don't make him mad.

600
00:30:18,014 --> 00:30:19,737
Of course he's getting married.

601
00:30:19,774 --> 00:30:21,629
He's a man of his word.

602
00:30:21,662 --> 00:30:22,775
Is this national?

603
00:30:22,814 --> 00:30:23,894
You bet.

604
00:30:23,934 --> 00:30:28,244
Please, use your full zip codes.

605
00:30:28,286 --> 00:30:30,141
Greenleaf High,
cradle of crisis.

606
00:30:30,174 --> 00:30:32,378
Howard's seniors...
youth in the crossfire.

607
00:30:32,414 --> 00:30:35,513
Tell us in your own innocent
young words, is he gay?

608
00:30:35,550 --> 00:30:39,576
JACK: Oh, no. He told us.
It was all this huge mistake.

609
00:30:39,614 --> 00:30:43,357
MEREDITH: It happened 'cause he
likes poetry and uses a napkin.

610
00:30:43,390 --> 00:30:44,634
VICKY: Unlike some people.

611
00:30:44,670 --> 00:30:45,749
MIKE: What?

612
00:30:45,790 --> 00:30:48,637
PETER: Teens in turmoil.
And your message to America?

613
00:30:48,670 --> 00:30:50,557
BO YS: Greenleaf rules! Yeah!

614
00:30:50,590 --> 00:30:52,957
PETER: Kids on the edge.
A community in chaos.

615
00:30:52,990 --> 00:30:54,397
Indiana cries out.

616
00:30:54,430 --> 00:30:56,252
Howard, can you hear?

617
00:31:02,622 --> 00:31:06,299
HALLIWELL: Howard,
uh, you got a minute?

618
00:31:08,830 --> 00:31:10,586
Howard, uh...

619
00:31:11,550 --> 00:31:14,549
your... your life,
I mean, since...

620
00:31:14,590 --> 00:31:17,623
since the Oscars,
I can only imagine.

621
00:31:17,662 --> 00:31:20,477
HOWARD: It's over now.
It's fine. It's just fine.

622
00:31:20,510 --> 00:31:22,397
It's all ancient history.

623
00:31:22,430 --> 00:31:25,113
We do have graduation
coming up Monday...

624
00:31:25,150 --> 00:31:30,103
and you kind of put us right...
right in the spotlight.

625
00:31:30,142 --> 00:31:31,703
I'm so sorry, Tom.

626
00:31:31,742 --> 00:31:35,320
I'd be less than honest
if I didn't tell you...

627
00:31:35,358 --> 00:31:41,108
that I've gotten some calls
from parents...

628
00:31:41,150 --> 00:31:46,136
wondering if, in fact,
you were a ho... ho...

629
00:31:46,174 --> 00:31:47,832
h-ho... h-ho...

630
00:31:47,870 --> 00:31:49,147
Home room teacher?

631
00:31:49,182 --> 00:31:51,004
Homo-hom-homosexual.

632
00:31:52,542 --> 00:31:54,909
Tom, do I look like
a homosexual?

633
00:31:54,942 --> 00:31:57,015
Would you walk for me?

634
00:31:58,206 --> 00:31:59,482
Excuse me.

635
00:32:00,318 --> 00:32:01,495
Uh, Howard?

636
00:32:01,534 --> 00:32:03,127
Yes.

637
00:32:03,166 --> 00:32:05,654
Do you enjoy teaching?

638
00:32:06,686 --> 00:32:08,442
No, I don't enjoy it.

639
00:32:08,478 --> 00:32:10,039
You don't?

640
00:32:10,078 --> 00:32:12,598
No, I love it. It's my life.

641
00:32:12,638 --> 00:32:15,801
HALLIWELL: Then you'd miss it?

642
00:32:18,878 --> 00:32:21,529
Are you threatening me?

643
00:32:21,566 --> 00:32:22,679
No, no.

644
00:32:22,718 --> 00:32:24,922
I'm... l'm your friend.

645
00:32:24,958 --> 00:32:27,479
Friends don't threaten.

646
00:32:28,030 --> 00:32:29,492
No, they don't.

647
00:32:29,534 --> 00:32:31,443
Friends warn.

648
00:32:31,486 --> 00:32:33,820
And you, uh...

649
00:32:33,854 --> 00:32:37,051
you are getting married,
aren't you?

650
00:32:37,086 --> 00:32:39,290
But are you saying...

651
00:32:39,326 --> 00:32:43,101
that if I weren't getting
married, I'd be fired?

652
00:32:44,734 --> 00:32:47,734
- That's not an issue, is it?
- No.

653
00:32:48,894 --> 00:32:50,007
Best wishes.

654
00:33:02,663 --> 00:33:03,776
HOWARD: Hi.

655
00:33:03,816 --> 00:33:05,092
PRIEST: Bless you.

656
00:33:05,128 --> 00:33:06,273
Thank you.

657
00:33:06,311 --> 00:33:08,286
Would you like to tell me
your sins?

658
00:33:08,327 --> 00:33:10,596
Yes. Yes.

659
00:33:10,632 --> 00:33:12,999
First of all, I'm not Catholic.

660
00:33:13,031 --> 00:33:14,406
Then why are you here?

661
00:33:14,439 --> 00:33:17,668
I have a friend who's Catholic,
and he's busy.

662
00:33:17,704 --> 00:33:19,744
Aren't you helpful?

663
00:33:19,784 --> 00:33:22,467
What are his, you know, sins?
Your friend's?

664
00:33:22,504 --> 00:33:26,432
He's a plumber,
and he's about to be married.

665
00:33:26,471 --> 00:33:28,162
He's been engaged
for three years.

666
00:33:28,199 --> 00:33:30,207
Caution is a virtue.

667
00:33:30,248 --> 00:33:32,517
Yeah, but everyone's...

668
00:33:32,552 --> 00:33:35,967
Everyone's saying something
about him that isn't true.

669
00:33:36,008 --> 00:33:38,943
It's not a bad thing,
but he isn't that thing.

670
00:33:38,984 --> 00:33:42,497
Which thing are people
saying about him?

671
00:33:43,335 --> 00:33:44,448
That, um...

672
00:33:45,767 --> 00:33:47,076
[Whispering]
That he's gay.

673
00:33:47,112 --> 00:33:48,224
That he's what?

674
00:33:49,351 --> 00:33:50,977
That he's gay.

675
00:33:51,015 --> 00:33:52,357
Oh! Oh, my.

676
00:33:52,391 --> 00:33:53,569
Yeah.

677
00:33:53,607 --> 00:33:55,014
Oh, my, my.

678
00:33:55,048 --> 00:33:57,088
That's rather like that fellow
on the Oscars.

679
00:33:57,128 --> 00:34:00,925
That, uh, Howard Brackett...
from over at Greenleaf.

680
00:34:00,968 --> 00:34:02,724
It's not him.
It's a different guy.

681
00:34:02,759 --> 00:34:04,036
What does he want?

682
00:34:04,071 --> 00:34:06,493
He wants to know
what he should do.

683
00:34:06,535 --> 00:34:09,088
What is the right thing?
He needs to know...

684
00:34:09,127 --> 00:34:11,037
His mother's planning
this huge wedding...

685
00:34:11,079 --> 00:34:14,854
with the whole town,
and it's her whole life.

686
00:34:14,887 --> 00:34:16,775
It's gonna be beautiful...

687
00:34:16,807 --> 00:34:22,404
but he doesn't want
to leave this town.

688
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:28,769
He has this wonderful fiancée
who's sweet and thin and...

689
00:34:28,808 --> 00:34:31,939
he just has never had a physical
relationship with her.

690
00:34:31,976 --> 00:34:34,277
Never? In three years?

691
00:34:34,312 --> 00:34:35,424
He respects her.

692
00:34:35,464 --> 00:34:36,805
- He's gay.
- No, he's not.

693
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:39,622
- Yes, he is.
- No, he can't... no.

694
00:34:40,231 --> 00:34:42,500
Then he must go to her.

695
00:34:42,536 --> 00:34:44,423
He's got to find out.

696
00:34:44,456 --> 00:34:49,758
He must be, you know,
be with her. Huh?

697
00:34:49,799 --> 00:34:51,425
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

698
00:34:53,704 --> 00:34:55,460
Before the wedding?

699
00:34:56,744 --> 00:34:58,500
Godspeed, my son.

00:54:22,159 --> 00:54:23,719
CAMERON: Miss Montgomery?

1072
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:28,200
PETER: The real question is,
where is Cameron Drake?

1073
00:54:28,239 --> 00:54:31,207
This is Peter Malloy
for Inside Entertainment.

1074
00:54:31,247 --> 00:54:32,741
CAMERON: We got to leave.

1075
00:54:33,616 --> 00:54:36,005
- Cam?
- We got to go.

1076
00:54:36,719 --> 00:54:38,148
Go where?

1077
00:54:38,191 --> 00:54:40,428
CAMERON: Greenleaf...
because of what I said.

1078
00:54:40,463 --> 00:54:42,852
I got to see what's going on
and do something.

1079
00:54:42,895 --> 00:54:45,034
But I promised Isaac
I'd do his show.

1080
00:54:45,071 --> 00:54:46,827
The new collection
is this afternoon.

1081
00:54:46,863 --> 00:54:49,809
I have to shower and vomit.

1082
00:54:53,617 --> 00:54:56,814
MIKE: Man! At his wedding.

1083
00:54:56,849 --> 00:54:58,093
VICKY: Poor Miss Montgomery.

1084
00:54:59,665 --> 00:55:03,407
JACK: I guess Mr. Brackett's
really like Cameron said.

1085
00:55:03,441 --> 00:55:06,310
MIKE: Uh, duh.
And you hung out with him.

1086
00:55:06,353 --> 00:55:08,720
He drove you
to that college interview.

1087
00:55:08,753 --> 00:55:11,568
Didn't you, like,
stay over somewhere?

1088
00:55:11,601 --> 00:55:13,968
But nothing happened.

1089
00:55:14,001 --> 00:55:17,197
I don't even know the guy...
not anymore.

1090
00:55:17,234 --> 00:55:19,722
MEREDITH: Excuse me.
You don't know the guy?

1091
00:55:19,761 --> 00:55:21,005
He got you into college.

1092
00:55:21,041 --> 00:55:23,408
Just last week,
he was your total hero.

1093
00:55:23,442 --> 00:55:24,936
That was last week.

1094
00:55:25,905 --> 00:55:30,445
Guys, we had a gay teacher
all year.

1095
00:55:30,481 --> 00:55:34,442
We have to face that...
and move on with our lives.

1096
00:55:34,481 --> 00:55:36,423
VICKY:
What are you talking about?

1097
00:55:36,465 --> 00:55:39,400
MOTHER:
Kids, how was the wedding?

1098
00:55:41,041 --> 00:55:42,470
ALL: Fine!

1099
00:56:05,873 --> 00:56:09,354
BERNIECE: I can understand
about Howard being gay...

1100
00:56:09,393 --> 00:56:11,117
but I will never understand...

1101
00:56:11,153 --> 00:56:14,469
as long as I live,
as God is my witness...

1102
00:56:14,513 --> 00:56:17,132
how could he not want a wedding?

1103
00:56:17,169 --> 00:56:21,097
Oh, sweetie,
it's not your fault.

1104
00:56:21,138 --> 00:56:22,894
You have two boys.

1105
00:56:22,929 --> 00:56:26,028
You fed them, raised them,
and loved them the same.

1106
00:56:26,065 --> 00:56:27,854
And one of them is gay.

1107
00:56:27,889 --> 00:56:30,158
- And the other one is...
- Walter.

1108
00:56:31,569 --> 00:56:34,187
Howard was just being honest...

1109
00:56:34,226 --> 00:56:37,073
clearing the air
before he made a real mess.

1110
00:56:37,106 --> 00:56:38,283
What's wrong with that?

1111
00:56:38,322 --> 00:56:41,322
What are we so afraid of?

1112
00:56:41,361 --> 00:56:46,118
What do we think will happen
if we all just spill the beans?

1113
00:56:46,161 --> 00:56:48,616
Oh... I don't know.

1114
00:56:48,657 --> 00:56:51,024
All right... l'll start.

1115
00:56:53,778 --> 00:56:57,738
My Rice Krispie treats
that I made for the reception...

1116
00:56:59,601 --> 00:57:01,543
they're not my recipe.

1117
00:57:03,057 --> 00:57:04,584
It's Harriet Carter's.

1118
00:57:05,233 --> 00:57:08,365
After she died from
that massive embolism...

1119
00:57:08,401 --> 00:57:10,124
a lie was born.

1120
00:57:12,049 --> 00:57:14,570
These are a dead woman's treats.

1121
00:57:14,609 --> 00:57:16,169
Oh.

1122
00:57:16,210 --> 00:57:17,966
Oh, my.

1123
00:57:21,361 --> 00:57:23,216
All right.

1124
00:57:23,249 --> 00:57:25,900
I'll say it right out loud.

1125
00:57:27,505 --> 00:57:31,182
I hated "The Bridges
of Madison County."

1126
00:57:33,777 --> 00:57:36,014
My husband has three testicles.

1127
00:57:38,194 --> 00:57:39,470
Bob?

1128
00:57:41,201 --> 00:57:42,543
It's disgusting.

1129

1134
00:58:10,641 --> 00:58:11,851
Howard?

1135
00:58:40,625 --> 00:58:41,738
So?

1136
00:58:43,826 --> 00:58:44,971
So.

1137
00:58:49,649 --> 00:58:51,340
Are you still gay?

1138
00:58:53,170 --> 00:58:54,380
Yep.

1139
00:58:59,538 --> 00:59:01,480
Are you going to have
an operation?

1140
00:59:01,521 --> 00:59:02,895
Excuse me?

1141
00:59:02,930 --> 00:59:05,930
Will you be going
into show business?

1142
00:59:05,969 --> 00:59:07,627
Absolutely.

1143
00:59:07,665 --> 00:59:09,160
Vegas.

1144
00:59:09,201 --> 00:59:11,503
I'm making an effort here.

1145
00:59:12,305 --> 00:59:13,712
I know, Dad.

1146
00:59:13,746 --> 00:59:15,404
I'm a farmer.

1147
00:59:17,745 --> 00:59:20,134
Your mother asked me to come.
She's worried about you.

1148
00:59:20,177 --> 00:59:22,566
She's afraid you're not eating.

1149
00:59:24,081 --> 00:59:26,602
She sent you this.

1150
00:59:26,641 --> 00:59:28,812
- What is it?
- Wedding cake.

1151
00:59:28,850 --> 00:59:30,279
She's diabolical.

1152
00:59:30,321 --> 00:59:32,044
She's insane.

1153
00:59:36,849 --> 00:59:41,486
Will, uh, we be seeing you
at the graduation tomorrow?

1154
00:59:43,346 --> 00:59:47,502
I got a call after the wedding...
or after there was no wedding.

1155
00:59:47,538 --> 00:59:48,944
They fired me.

1156
00:59:58,673 --> 01:00:00,582
You taught those kids.

1157
01:00:02,450 --> 01:00:05,799
If you're not there,
what are they going to think?

1158
01:00:07,025 --> 01:00:08,203
I don't know.

1159
01:00:11,921 --> 01:00:13,034
[Sighs]

1160
01:00:14,578 --> 01:00:17,894
That Barbra Streisand...
did she do something to you?

1161

Cam!

1166
01:00:34,970 --> 01:00:37,817
Cameron, where are we?

1167
01:00:37,850 --> 01:00:39,890
I told you. It's a motel.

1168
01:00:42,009 --> 01:00:45,108
SONYA:
You don't seem to realize.

1169
01:00:45,145 --> 01:00:47,152
I am a supermodel.

1170

I am Sonya!

1171
01:00:48,762 --> 01:00:51,664
And I'm in a motel
in Greenblatt?

Greenleaf.
This is where I grew up.

1173
01:00:53,977 --> 01:00:55,155
I don't care!

1174
01:00:55,193 --> 01:00:58,160
Sonya,
we're here to help someone.

1175
01:00:58,202 --> 01:00:59,925
For once, we're gonna
think about something...

1176
01:00:59,961 --> 01:01:02,744
besides our careers
and our hair.

1177
01:01:02,777 --> 01:01:04,850
We're helping Mr. Brackett,
if I can find him.

You can't leave me here.

Eat something. I'm begging you.

1185

01:14:23,951 --> 01:14:28,621
that he's going to send out
some kind of voodoo vibes...

1427
01:14:28,655 --> 01:14:33,740
or gay microwaves
and make everybody else gay?

1428
01:14:33,776 --> 01:14:37,092
HALLIWELL:
In a crude manner of speaking.

1429
01:14:37,135 --> 01:14:39,852
CAMERON: Well, seniors,
you've all had Mr. Brackett.

1430
01:14:39,888 --> 01:14:41,546
Is that the way it works?

1431
01:14:41,583 --> 01:14:44,998
HALLIWELL: Kids, you don't have
to answer that question.

1432
01:14:45,040 --> 01:14:47,276
AVA: It's an inappropriate
forum to discuss this.

1433
01:14:47,312 --> 01:14:49,548
HALLIWELL: This is still
a graduation ceremony.

1434
01:14:49,584 --> 01:14:51,918
ED: May I please finish
my acceptance speech?

1435

1436
01:14:53,392 --> 01:14:55,759
what is the definition
of a Hoosier?

1437
01:14:55,792 --> 01:14:57,166
Well, way back in...

1438
01:14:57,199 --> 01:14:58,792
JACK: Excuse me, I'm gay!

1439
01:15:02,128 --> 01:15:03,819
HALLIWELL: Who said that?

1440
01:15:08,880 --> 01:15:10,221
HOWARD: Jack.

1441
01:15:16,399 --> 01:15:19,978
I had Mr. Brackett
for senior English.

1442
01:15:20,016 --> 01:15:21,674
He taught me Shakespeare.

1443
01:15:22,480 --> 01:15:23,941
He was my track coach...

1444
01:15:23,983 --> 01:15:26,536
and he also helped me
get into college.

1445
01:15:28,367 --> 01:15:31,750
I just realized that what
Mr. Halliwell said is right.

1446
01:15:34,991 --> 01:15:36,453
It must've rubbed off.

1447
01:15:37,136 --> 01:15:38,597
I'm gay.

1449
01:15:40,495 --> 01:15:43,594
ED: This is exactly my point...
a young life corrupted.

1450
01:15:43,631 --> 01:15:45,093
Thank you. Very brave.

1451
01:15:45,136 --> 01:15:46,281
MEREDITH: Oh!

1452
01:15:46,320 --> 01:15:48,807
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

1453
01:15:48,848 --> 01:15:50,887
- Young lady?
- It's happening.

1454
01:15:50,928 --> 01:15:53,416
I had Mr. Brackett all year,
and...

1455
01:15:53,456 --> 01:15:55,660
Oh, my God, I'm gay!

1456
01:15:55,696 --> 01:15:57,256
Excuse me?

1457
01:15:57,296 --> 01:15:59,751
If there's something wrong
with Mr. Brackett or Jack...

1458
01:15:59,791 --> 01:16:02,442
then there's something wrong
with me. I'm gay.

1459
01:16:02,479 --> 01:16:03,559
VICKY: So am I.

1460
01:16:03,600 --> 01:16:05,258
ED: She is not!

1461
01:16:05,296 --> 01:16:07,336

You're a tramp.

MIKE: Oh, man.

1465
01:16:11,856 --> 01:16:13,165
JACK: Stirgo.

1466
01:16:13,200 --> 01:16:17,323
MIKE: All right. I'm gay.
I'm a homo. I like guys.

1467
01:16:17,360 --> 01:16:19,215
I still do it with chicks
every chance I get...

1468
01:16:19,247 --> 01:16:20,741
and I'm totally good at it...

1469
01:16:22,127 --> 01:16:24,942
but I hate it, and I'm gay.

1470
01:16:24,976 --> 01:16:27,463
HALLIWELL: Kids, kids, kids,
please, please, sit down.

1471
01:16:28,591 --> 01:16:29,868
We're here to graduate.

1472
01:16:29,904 --> 01:16:34,312
I'm sure Mr. Brackett
is gratified by your display.

1473
01:16:34,351 --> 01:16:38,410
Compassion is a wonderful
quality, however misguided.

1474
01:16:38,447 --> 01:16:41,862
But as Howard very well knows,
the decision is not yours.

1475
01:16:41,904 --> 01:16:43,311
It is a gonad thing.

1477
01:16:44,944 --> 01:16:47,562
A grown-up thing.

1478
01:16:48,848 --> 01:16:50,539
I have to answer
to the community...

1479
01:16:50,575 --> 01:16:52,714
and as far as the community
is concerned...

1480
01:16:54,128 --> 01:16:59,016
toward Howard Brackett,
they have said, "No, no, no."

1481
01:16:59,983 --> 01:17:03,758
HALLIWELL: Please sit down,
and let's pass out diplomas.

1482
01:17:04,752 --> 01:17:05,962
Well, I'm a...

1483
01:17:11,664 --> 01:17:12,940
I'm a member of the community...

1484
01:17:12,976 --> 01:17:14,830
and I don't mind
that Howard's gay.

1485
01:17:14,864 --> 01:17:16,587
HALLIWELL:
But you're his brother.

1486
01:17:18,640 --> 01:17:22,022
As... as you know.

1487
01:17:25,200 --> 01:17:26,858
So you know what that means?

1488
01:17:29,327 --> 01:17:32,142
Uh-oh. I must be gay.

1489
01:17:33,392 --> 01:17:36,261
HALLIWELL: But you're not
a parent, are you?

1490

FRANK: Excuse me, I'm a parent.

1491

FRANK: I've lived in this town
all my life.

1492
01:17:45,103 --> 01:17:46,445
I'm Howard's father.

1493
01:17:49,391 --> 01:17:51,279
And I'm gay!

1494
01:17:54,832 --> 01:17:58,956
BERNIECE: I'm Howard's mother,
and I'm very proud of him...

1495
01:17:58,991 --> 01:18:01,358
and I'm... I'm a lesbian.

1497
01:18:06,415 --> 01:18:09,677
Hi. I run the Bridal Barn
for Better Brides...

1498
01:18:09,712 --> 01:18:12,078
and I can tell you
Howard has perfect taste.

1499
01:18:12,112 --> 01:18:14,763
So do I, so, I'm gay.

1500
01:18:15,856 --> 01:18:18,726
I'm Howard's stylist,
and I'm gay...

1501
01:18:19,376 --> 01:18:21,132
and I'm bald.

1502
01:18:22,800 --> 01:18:25,450
I deliver Howard's mail
and everybody else's.

1503
01:18:25,488 --> 01:18:28,422
I'm a federal employee,
and I'm gay!

But he's not
the teacher of the year!

I am,

deserves something else.

Oh, very snappy. Nervous?

No. Why should I be nervous?

01:20:11,792 --> 01:20:14,181
It's a wedding.
I want everything to be perfect.

1525

It will be.

Is your cameraman here?

1527
01:20:17,776 --> 01:20:20,460
No, not today.
I'm not filming this.

more important than show biz.

do you still take Frank to be
your lawfully wedded husband?

I do.

01:23:17,477 --> 01:23:18,819
Dig his chains.

1600
01:23:18,854 --> 01:23:21,952
You can best believe
that he's a macho man.

1601
01:23:21,990 --> 01:23:23,964
He likes to be the leader.

1602
01:23:24,006 --> 01:23:25,860
He never dresses grand.

1603
01:23:25,893 --> 01:23:29,308
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

1604
01:23:29,349 --> 01:23:30,910
Macho, macho man.

1605
01:23:30,949 --> 01:23:33,021
Macho man, yeah.

1606
01:23:33,062 --> 01:23:35,134
I've got to be a macho man.

1607
01:23:35,174 --> 01:23:36,253
I've got to be a...

1608
01:23:36,294 --> 01:23:39,807
Macho, macho man.

1609
01:23:39,845 --> 01:23:43,228
I've got to be a macho.

1610
01:23:43,269 --> 01:23:46,847
Macho, macho man.

1611
01:23:46,885 --> 01:23:49,057
I've got to be a macho man.

1612
01:23:49,093 --> 01:23:50,238
I've got to be a...

1613
01:23:50,278 --> 01:23:51,455
Macho, macho man.

1614
01:23:51,494 --> 01:23:53,730
Mucho, macho, macho man.

1615
01:23:53,766 --> 01:23:57,061
I've got to be a macho.

1616
01:23:57,093 --> 01:24:00,030
Macho, macho man.

1617
01:24:00,159 --> 01:24:01,107
DIANA ROSS: [Singing]
Hey, hey.

1618
01:24:01,150 --> 01:24:04,925
I... I will survive.

1619
01:24:04,959 --> 01:24:06,747
I... I will survive.

1620
01:24:06,783 --> 01:24:08,954
Oh, yeah.

1621
01:24:08,990 --> 01:24:12,089
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah.

1622
01:24:12,126 --> 01:24:14,996
It took all the strength I had
not to fall apart.

1623
01:24:15,038 --> 01:24:18,813
Just trying hard to mend
the pieces of my broken heart.

1624
01:24:18,846 --> 01:24:22,741
And I spent, oh, so many nights
just feeling sorry for myself.

1625
01:24:22,782 --> 01:24:26,394
I used to cry,
but now I hold my head up high.

1626
01:24:26,430 --> 01:24:28,121
And you see me...

1627
01:24:28,159 --> 01:24:30,101
somebody new.

1628
01:24:30,142 --> 01:24:33,852
I'm not that chained up little
person still in love with you.

1629
01:24:33,886 --> 01:24:35,773
And so you felt
like dropping in...

1630
01:24:35,806 --> 01:24:37,693
and just expect me to be free...

1631
01:24:37,726 --> 01:24:39,799
but now I'm saving
all my lovin'...

1632
01:24:39,838 --> 01:24:41,463
for someone who's lovin' me.

1633
01:24:41,502 --> 01:24:43,258
Go on, now, go.

1634
01:24:43,294 --> 01:24:45,236
Walk out the door.

1635
01:24:45,279 --> 01:24:47,133
Just turn around now.

1636
01:24:47,166 --> 01:24:49,435
You're not welcome anymore.

1637
01:24:50,014 --> 01:24:52,916
Weren't you the one who tried
to break me with good-bye?

1638
01:24:52,959 --> 01:24:54,715
Did you think I'd crumble?

1639
01:24:54,750 --> 01:24:56,790
Did you think
I'd lay down and die?

1640
01:24:56,830 --> 01:24:58,554
No, not I.

1641
01:24:58,590 --> 01:25:00,412
I will survive.

1642
01:25:00,447 --> 01:25:04,408
As long as I know how to love,
I know I'll stay alive.

1643
01:25:04,446 --> 01:25:08,221
I've got all my life to live,
I've got all my love to give.

1644
01:25:08,254 --> 01:25:09,847
I'll survive.

1645
01:25:09,887 --> 01:25:12,734
I will survive.

1646
01:25:12,767 --> 01:25:15,484
Hey.

1647
01:25:15,518 --> 01:25:17,405
Go, now, go.

1648
01:25:17,438 --> 01:25:19,260
Walk out the door.

1649
01:25:19,295 --> 01:25:21,204
Just turn around now...

1650
01:25:21,246 --> 01:25:23,930
'cause you're not welcome
anymore.

1651
01:25:23,966 --> 01:25:26,781
Weren't you the one who tried
to break me with good-bye?

1652
01:25:26,815 --> 01:25:28,669
Did you think I'd crumble?

1653
01:25:28,702 --> 01:25:30,611
Did you think
I'd lay down and die?

1654
01:25:30,655 --> 01:25:32,443
Oh, no, not I.

1655
01:25:32,479 --> 01:25:34,366
I will survive.

1656
01:25:34,399 --> 01:25:38,360
As long as I know how to love,
I know I'll stay alive.

1657
01:25:38,398 --> 01:25:42,140
I've got all my life to live,
I've got all my love to give.

1658
01:25:42,175 --> 01:25:43,865
I'll survive.

1659
01:25:43,902 --> 01:25:45,724
I will survive.

1660
01:25:45,759 --> 01:25:47,930
I will survive.

1661
01:25:47,966 --> 01:25:49,657
I will survive.

1662
01:25:49,694 --> 01:25:50,774
Hey.

1663
01:25:50,815 --> 01:25:52,637
I... I will survive.

1664
01:25:52,670 --> 01:25:54,493
I'll be there.

1665
01:25:54,526 --> 01:25:57,276
I... I will survive.

1666
01:25:57,310 --> 01:25:58,390
Yeah, yeah.

1667
01:25:58,430 --> 01:26:00,951

I... I will survive.

1670
01:26:04,830 --> 01:26:05,910
Ooh.

1671
01:26:05,950 --> 01:26:07,892
I... I will survive.

1672
01:26:07,934 --> 01:26:09,625
I'm dancin' all night.

1673
01:26:09,663 --> 01:26:11,605
I... I will survive.

1674
01:26:13,022 --> 01:26:17,179

I... I will survive.

1679
01:26:26,462 --> 01:26:28,350
My lovin' is not in vain.

1680
01:26:28,382 --> 01:26:32,376
