1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,214
My name is Roman.

2
00:00:01,276 --> 00:00:04,092
Ten years ago,  our ship
crash-landed on Earth...

3
00:00:04,123 --> 00:00:06,200
we came here seeking refuge,

4
00:00:06,219 --> 00:00:08,686
but the Humans thought
that it was an invasion.

5
00:00:10,768 --> 00:00:13,703
That night, I met a human
girl who tried to protect me,

6
00:00:13,709 --> 00:00:15,875
a girl I never thought I'd see again.

7
00:00:16,161 --> 00:00:18,746
The surviving members
of my race, the Atrians,

8
00:00:18,808 --> 00:00:21,949
were rounded up and isolated
inside a militarized sector.

9
00:00:21,951 --> 00:00:23,852
Now it's 2024.

10
00:00:23,869 --> 00:00:25,804
Seven of us have been
chosen to attend high school

11
00:00:25,838 --> 00:00:28,119
as a part of a government
integration program,

12
00:00:28,137 --> 00:00:31,316
but the humans and Atrians
continue to distrust each other,

13
00:00:31,666 --> 00:00:33,637
while I fight to protect my people

14
00:00:33,693 --> 00:00:37,087
and the human girl who
saved my life at any cost.

15
00:00:37,562 --> 00:00:39,465
Previously on Star-Crossed...

16
00:00:39,534 --> 00:00:41,517
This program is the first step

17
00:00:41,573 --> 00:00:43,262
toward unifying our races.

18
00:00:43,268 --> 00:00:45,177
Dad, they're never gonna
treat us like equals.

19
00:00:45,191 --> 00:00:46,548
I have faith in them.

20
00:00:46,942 --> 00:00:47,980
Keep these guys back.

21
00:00:48,005 --> 00:00:49,701
Oh, my God, it's your dad.

22
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:53,063
Emery: You're going home?

23
00:00:53,065 --> 00:00:54,648
The chemo isn't working.

24
00:00:57,402 --> 00:00:59,703
(Slow, steady beeping)

25
00:00:59,705 --> 00:01:04,208
(Grunting)

26
00:01:10,510 --> 00:01:12,663
How could you let my son go out there?

27
00:01:12,668 --> 00:01:13,884
Let me see your hands.

28
00:01:13,886 --> 00:01:15,321
(Officers shouting)

29
00:01:15,338 --> 00:01:16,686
Wait! No!

30
00:01:16,806 --> 00:01:18,689
(Gunshot)

31
00:01:25,146 --> 00:01:27,765
(Indistinct chatter)

32
00:01:47,919 --> 00:01:50,537
(Indistinct chatter)

33
00:02:01,961 --> 00:02:03,600
Come on. You know the drill.

34
00:02:03,602 --> 00:02:05,936
(Beeping)

35
00:02:06,466 --> 00:02:07,521
Hey.

36
00:02:07,699 --> 00:02:09,363
You need a license to sell.

37
00:02:09,775 --> 00:02:12,342
(Beeping)

38
00:02:19,222 --> 00:02:20,110
Hey!

39
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:21,656
It's all clear.

40
00:02:26,374 --> 00:02:29,109
(Alarm blaring) (Shouting, screaming)

41
00:02:52,817 --> 00:02:55,552
(Birds chirping)

42
00:02:55,554 --> 00:02:57,317
Reporter: Police are
investigating an attack

43
00:02:57,323 --> 00:02:59,776
at the sector by a
militant group of Atrians.

44
00:02:59,789 --> 00:03:02,162
Officials believe they're
seeking retribution

45
00:03:02,205 --> 00:03:04,608
for the death of Atrian
leader and activist, Nox,

46
00:03:04,658 --> 00:03:06,836
who was killed two days ago by a guard.

47
00:03:06,867 --> 00:03:08,043
I can't stand this.

48
00:03:08,451 --> 00:03:10,082
My dad isn't a murderer.

49
00:03:10,202 --> 00:03:12,119
He didn't mean to kill Roman's dad.

50
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:13,370
It was an accident.

51
00:03:14,055 --> 00:03:15,906
You have to stop watching that.

52
00:03:16,782 --> 00:03:18,465
I'll just have to tell him, "look,

53
00:03:18,478 --> 00:03:21,343
Roman, I know things are
complicated right now, but

54
00:03:21,362 --> 00:03:23,376
I just want you to know
that I'm here for you

55
00:03:23,395 --> 00:03:25,716
- and if you want to talk or..."
- Em,

56
00:03:25,723 --> 00:03:27,149
I know you care about Roman

57
00:03:27,186 --> 00:03:29,282
and want to find a way
to ease his pain, but...

58
00:03:29,557 --> 00:03:31,388
I don't think it's gonna be that simple.

59
00:03:31,390 --> 00:03:32,799
(Sighs)

60
00:03:33,055 --> 00:03:35,425
(Chuckles) I'm sorry. We...

61
00:03:36,071 --> 00:03:38,799
haven't even properly celebrated you

62
00:03:38,824 --> 00:03:40,388
kicking cancer's ass.

63
00:03:40,407 --> 00:03:41,984
All in due time, my friend.

64
00:03:42,535 --> 00:03:44,001
(Sighs)

65
00:03:44,824 --> 00:03:46,870
I wish you were coming to school with me.

66
00:03:46,908 --> 00:03:48,122
In a few days.

67
00:03:48,124 --> 00:03:50,187
Doc Benson wants to run some more tests.

68
00:03:50,762 --> 00:03:52,746
I don't know if you've heard, but...

69
00:03:52,866 --> 00:03:54,166
I'm kind of a miracle.

70
00:03:54,185 --> 00:03:55,379
(Chuckles)

71
00:03:55,381 --> 00:03:56,713
(Chuckles)

72
00:03:58,878 --> 00:04:00,384
It's so strange.

73
00:04:00,386 --> 00:04:02,132
All I remember from that night

74
00:04:02,175 --> 00:04:03,902
is a dream about...

75
00:04:04,177 --> 00:04:07,936
a blue angel who came into
my hospital room and cured me.

76
00:04:08,144 --> 00:04:10,094
Freaky, huh?

77
00:04:11,346 --> 00:04:12,846
Yeah.

78
00:04:15,413 --> 00:04:17,634
Why do we have to crush the cyper?

79
00:04:18,597 --> 00:04:21,625
Dad said it releases
the higunu of the plant.

80
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:23,834
Its energy.

81
00:04:24,165 --> 00:04:26,160
It's part of the ritual for dad's ceremony.

82
00:04:26,162 --> 00:04:29,026
- (Door opens)
- There's so much I always wanted to ask him,

83
00:04:29,058 --> 00:04:30,315
but I never got the chance.

84
00:04:30,353 --> 00:04:32,987
I don't even know how cyper is grown.

85
00:04:33,018 --> 00:04:35,169
Or why we have to keep it a secret.

86
00:04:35,171 --> 00:04:36,703
Self-preservation.

87
00:04:36,705 --> 00:04:39,682
If humans ever learned of
the curative capabilities

88
00:04:39,695 --> 00:04:42,429
of combining an Atrian's blood and cyper,

89
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:44,787
our tribesmen would all become lab rats.

90
00:04:44,819 --> 00:04:46,283
If there's anything you want to know,

91
00:04:46,326 --> 00:04:48,097
you could always ask your Uncle Castor.

92
00:04:48,133 --> 00:04:50,551
- Have things calmed down outside?
- For now.

93
00:04:50,553 --> 00:04:52,286
Luckily, no guards were killed.

94
00:04:52,406 --> 00:04:55,218
But I suspect more attacks
by the Trags will follow.

95
00:04:55,286 --> 00:04:56,794
Sophia: Why are they doing this?

96
00:04:56,914 --> 00:04:59,443
Not a single human was punished
for your father's death.

97
00:04:59,445 --> 00:05:01,449
The Trags are sending
a message to our people

98
00:05:01,468 --> 00:05:02,778
that we are not powerless,

99
00:05:02,898 --> 00:05:05,691
that by joining them is the
only way to achieve freedom.

100
00:05:05,811 --> 00:05:07,868
So they're exploiting my father's death

101
00:05:07,887 --> 00:05:09,501
as a recruitment strategy.

102
00:05:14,505 --> 00:05:17,114
Maia: Roman, Castor's
taking over preparations

103
00:05:17,133 --> 00:05:19,195
for your father's ogmon.

104
00:05:20,756 --> 00:05:21,907
This is my duty.

105
00:05:22,027 --> 00:05:23,333
Castor: There is much to do,

106
00:05:23,335 --> 00:05:25,802
- and you have school.
- I don't have to go.

107
00:05:26,721 --> 00:05:28,972
We should start preparing the soil.

108
00:05:34,929 --> 00:05:36,979
(Door shuts)

109
00:05:38,051 --> 00:05:40,017
The only time Castor
used to come by to see us

110
00:05:40,072 --> 00:05:41,586
was to pick a fight with dad.

111
00:05:42,377 --> 00:05:44,098
Now he's so eager to be involved.

112
00:05:44,592 --> 00:05:46,240
Just give him a chance.

113
00:05:47,617 --> 00:05:50,817
Saul: It has been a trying
couple of days for our community.

114
00:05:51,305 --> 00:05:52,908
Our counselors are available to you

115
00:05:52,926 --> 00:05:54,509
should you need to speak with someone.

116
00:05:54,629 --> 00:05:56,749
I know you may have
concerns, but I assure you

117
00:05:56,780 --> 00:05:59,564
your safety and well-being
remain our highest priority.

118
00:05:59,602 --> 00:06:01,009
Eric: And how do we know
one of them doesn't try

119
00:06:01,035 --> 00:06:02,092
to blow up the school next?

120
00:06:02,117 --> 00:06:03,431
The school board is meeting today

121
00:06:03,468 --> 00:06:05,533
to discuss heightening security measures,

122
00:06:05,777 --> 00:06:07,835
as well as whether or not to move forward

123
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:09,734
with tomorrow night's homecoming carnival.

124
00:06:11,776 --> 00:06:13,478
I am all for equality,

125
00:06:13,598 --> 00:06:15,661
but when they start messing with tradition,

126
00:06:15,781 --> 00:06:17,657
that's when I go turbo bitch.

127
00:06:17,713 --> 00:06:20,504
- I mean, is nothing sacred?
- You guys murdered our leader,

128
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:23,044
and you're worried about
cancelling some weird ritual

129
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:24,339
where you celebrate, what,

130
00:06:24,351 --> 00:06:25,409
going home?

131
00:06:25,811 --> 00:06:27,845
I would celebrate you going home.

132
00:06:27,847 --> 00:06:29,788
- (Students chuckle)
- Hey, Em.

133
00:06:30,219 --> 00:06:32,403
Your dad doing okay?

134
00:06:32,948 --> 00:06:34,099
It's hard to say.

135
00:06:34,606 --> 00:06:37,265
Any time I ask him about it,
he just changes the subject.

136
00:06:37,666 --> 00:06:39,605
Hey, your dad's a hero.

137
00:06:40,362 --> 00:06:41,495
Nox would've killed that guard

138
00:06:41,507 --> 00:06:42,627
if your dad hadn't shot him.

139
00:06:42,646 --> 00:06:44,629
Emery: I don't think
that's how it happened.

140
00:06:44,817 --> 00:06:46,975
I think she lost all credibility

141
00:06:46,994 --> 00:06:48,733
the second she took off into the woods

142
00:06:48,853 --> 00:06:50,253
- with a tattie.
- Hey.

143
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:52,224
Just give it a rest.

144
00:06:52,875 --> 00:06:55,992
(School bell rings)

145
00:06:59,330 --> 00:07:00,675
Roman.

146
00:07:02,245 --> 00:07:03,882
You won't even talk to me now?

147
00:07:04,002 --> 00:07:05,017
I can't.

148
00:07:05,048 --> 00:07:06,337
It was an accident.

149
00:07:06,574 --> 00:07:08,086
Roman, it was an accident.

150
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:09,684
- I am so sorry.
- Why?

151
00:07:09,709 --> 00:07:12,130
Because my father's dead? Or
because your father shot him?

152
00:07:13,963 --> 00:07:15,890
Because you're in pain.

153
00:07:19,351 --> 00:07:21,591
Will you at least let me thank you?

154
00:07:24,375 --> 00:07:25,595
For what?

155
00:07:30,394 --> 00:07:33,000
I found this in Julia's hospital room.

156
00:07:33,463 --> 00:07:35,202
You saved her life.

157
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:37,261
She probably swiped it
as a souvenir when you two

158
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:38,643
broke into the sector last week.

159
00:07:38,675 --> 00:07:40,902
- No, she would've told me if she had.
- It didn't happen.

160
00:07:41,647 --> 00:07:43,523
Just... please,

161
00:07:43,525 --> 00:07:44,958
let it go.

162
00:07:49,013 --> 00:07:51,520
We're from two different worlds, Emery.

163
00:07:52,859 --> 00:07:55,737
We can't keep pretending
like that doesn't matter.

164
00:07:56,694 --> 00:07:59,628
It only matters if we let it.

165
00:08:00,648 --> 00:08:02,100
Roman.

166
00:08:02,312 --> 00:08:04,665
Let's go. Bus is leaving.

167
00:08:05,063 --> 00:08:06,945
Time to get back to the sector.

168
00:08:07,065 --> 00:08:08,865
(Chuckles)

169
00:08:08,867 --> 00:08:09,976
Yeah.

170
00:08:10,402 --> 00:08:12,367
Thanks, Beaumont.

171
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:14,707
You all right, Emery?

172
00:08:15,445 --> 00:08:17,873
Yeah.

173
00:08:18,205 --> 00:08:19,594
Your dad's gonna be okay.

174
00:08:19,650 --> 00:08:21,545
We're all supporting him.

175
00:08:22,559 --> 00:08:23,785
Thank you.

176
00:08:23,905 --> 00:08:26,037
Good evening. I'm ray Whitehill.

177
00:08:26,075 --> 00:08:27,433
I will be taking

178
00:08:27,458 --> 00:08:30,179
a temporary leave of
absence from the force,

179
00:08:30,354 --> 00:08:32,876
but my colleague, officer Jack Beaumont,

180
00:08:32,996 --> 00:08:34,916
will be speaking on behalf of the SEU

181
00:08:34,947 --> 00:08:36,717
about last night's attack.

182
00:08:40,403 --> 00:08:42,655
Beaumont: In order to
prevent another incident,

183
00:08:42,668 --> 00:08:45,120
we will be conducting
unscheduled pod searches.

184
00:08:45,133 --> 00:08:47,272
But what about the safety
of our kids in school?

185
00:08:47,285 --> 00:08:48,604
Each of the Atrian seven

186
00:08:48,629 --> 00:08:50,622
submit to a security scan before entering.

187
00:08:50,631 --> 00:08:52,884
Saul: Though we remind you
the seven are not to blame

188
00:08:52,902 --> 00:08:54,060
for last night's attack.

189
00:08:54,104 --> 00:08:55,949
This has been a difficult few days.

190
00:08:55,956 --> 00:08:57,094
For all of us.

191
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:59,247
But we must now focus

192
00:08:59,251 --> 00:09:01,334
on healing relations between our races.

193
00:09:01,544 --> 00:09:03,852
Now, let's not forget
that this program presents

194
00:09:03,890 --> 00:09:05,529
a unique opportunity

195
00:09:05,723 --> 00:09:07,055
for not only our kids

196
00:09:07,074 --> 00:09:08,974
but for society as a whole

197
00:09:09,094 --> 00:09:10,127
to interact with

198
00:09:10,171 --> 00:09:13,287
- and learn from the Atrians.
- Man: I know what I want to learn.

199
00:09:14,657 --> 00:09:17,266
How they plan to colonize our planet.

200
00:09:17,704 --> 00:09:20,225
'Cause we all know that's
what they're really here for.

201
00:09:20,238 --> 00:09:22,466
(Scattered applause) Mr.
Vartan, you've made your views

202
00:09:22,507 --> 00:09:24,043
and those of your fellow Red Hawks

203
00:09:24,068 --> 00:09:25,694
very clear at these meetings.

204
00:09:25,738 --> 00:09:27,453
However, the government has no reason

205
00:09:27,465 --> 00:09:28,829
- to believe...
- What about the rumors

206
00:09:28,864 --> 00:09:30,014
that some of these tatties

207
00:09:30,018 --> 00:09:32,314
have learned how to remove their markings

208
00:09:32,339 --> 00:09:35,186
and embed themselves in our society?

209
00:09:35,236 --> 00:09:36,387
And our government.

210
00:09:36,406 --> 00:09:38,953
We're here to discuss
the integration program,

211
00:09:39,234 --> 00:09:41,180
not conspiracy theories.

212
00:09:41,424 --> 00:09:43,044
Who is that guy?

213
00:09:43,862 --> 00:09:45,384
Robert Vartan.

214
00:09:45,578 --> 00:09:46,911
Veteran red hawk.

215
00:09:47,031 --> 00:09:50,158
"And God said, let us
make man in our image,"

216
00:09:50,571 --> 00:09:52,253
- (scattered applause)
- "After our likeness:"

217
00:09:52,291 --> 00:09:54,380
"And let them have dominion over every

218
00:09:54,412 --> 00:09:56,820
creeping thing that creeps upon the Earth."

219
00:09:56,842 --> 00:09:58,384
Mr. Vartan, please take a seat.

220
00:09:58,390 --> 00:10:00,123
What about the homecoming carnival?

221
00:10:00,155 --> 00:10:01,481
Saul: Ms. Garcia and I have discussed it

222
00:10:01,494 --> 00:10:03,509
and we believe the community
should not be deprived

223
00:10:03,534 --> 00:10:05,223
of one of its most valued traditions.

224
00:10:05,273 --> 00:10:07,350
I... I think the board
should vote on the issue.

225
00:10:12,355 --> 00:10:14,169
All those in favor

226
00:10:14,213 --> 00:10:17,310
of the Atrian seven
attending homecoming carnival

227
00:10:17,430 --> 00:10:18,931
raise your hand.

228
00:10:30,388 --> 00:10:32,246
So it's settled then.

229
00:10:32,621 --> 00:10:34,561
The Atrian seven will not be permitted

230
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:36,025
to attend the carnival.

231
00:10:36,057 --> 00:10:37,526
So, if there are any other issues...

232
00:10:37,564 --> 00:10:39,115
You don't even know them!

233
00:10:41,294 --> 00:10:43,496
The Atrian seven aren't terrorists.

234
00:10:43,715 --> 00:10:44,841
They're teenagers.

235
00:10:44,891 --> 00:10:47,094
Little girl, please. You don't
know what you're talking about.

236
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:49,428
Ray: Hey, watch it. That's my daughter.

237
00:10:49,548 --> 00:10:51,405
Emery: You say you want to learn from them,

238
00:10:51,442 --> 00:10:54,226
but you won't even allow
them to come to our carnival?

239
00:10:54,527 --> 00:10:56,047
How can they learn to trust us

240
00:10:56,079 --> 00:10:58,318
when we don't give them reason to?

241
00:10:58,894 --> 00:11:00,787
Man: Yeah, she's right.

242
00:11:00,789 --> 00:11:02,337
(Loud, overlapping chatter)

243
00:11:02,457 --> 00:11:03,957
Woman: Any comment?

244
00:11:03,959 --> 00:11:06,493
How are you coping with
your father's death?

245
00:11:06,495 --> 00:11:08,679
Do you blame the guard?

246
00:11:09,131 --> 00:11:11,839
Do you have any idea who was
behind last night's attack?

247
00:11:12,014 --> 00:11:13,950
The guards must be bracing for riots.

248
00:11:13,952 --> 00:11:15,343
That's not all they're worried about.

249
00:11:15,355 --> 00:11:18,353
I heard the Trags used the attack on
the guards' booth as a distraction.

250
00:11:19,547 --> 00:11:21,903
A distraction? For what?

251
00:11:21,909 --> 00:11:24,550
- Steal a cache of the guards' weapons.
- Roman?

252
00:11:27,184 --> 00:11:29,780
The hwatab... they want to see you.

253
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:32,986
Come.

254
00:11:42,779 --> 00:11:45,869
Castor: Roman, these are the
elders of the four tribes...

255
00:11:45,907 --> 00:11:47,721
the Vwasak, the Iwabas,

256
00:11:48,003 --> 00:11:49,918
the Swamad, and, our tribe,

257
00:11:50,038 --> 00:11:51,438
the Zwahan.

258
00:11:51,632 --> 00:11:54,147
_

259
00:11:54,454 --> 00:11:57,210
I'm sorry. My sondiv is a little rusty.

260
00:11:57,212 --> 00:11:59,472
My father encouraged us to speak English.

261
00:11:59,948 --> 00:12:03,289
Your father was a very progressive iksen.

262
00:12:03,409 --> 00:12:05,235
He had big plans for you.

263
00:12:12,261 --> 00:12:15,389
Many of our people still
believe in Nox's message

264
00:12:15,509 --> 00:12:17,753
that justice, peace and
equality can be attained

265
00:12:17,785 --> 00:12:19,718
using non-violent means.

266
00:12:19,943 --> 00:12:22,296
But we fear the Trags
are growing in number.

267
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:24,123
Wvasak elder: We fear war with the humans

268
00:12:24,142 --> 00:12:26,626
- could be on the horizon.
- Zwahan elder: We've called on you

269
00:12:26,682 --> 00:12:28,703
because, as Nox's firstborn child

270
00:12:28,759 --> 00:12:31,387
and a member of the
ruling Zwahan tribe, you,

271
00:12:31,507 --> 00:12:33,477
are the next in line to lead.

272
00:12:33,597 --> 00:12:36,436
We know this is a daunting
task for someone so young,

273
00:12:36,556 --> 00:12:38,601
so we will appoint an interim leader

274
00:12:38,613 --> 00:12:40,703
until you feel you are ready.

275
00:12:41,629 --> 00:12:43,462
Who did you have in mind?

276
00:12:43,968 --> 00:12:45,120
Roman...

277
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:47,479
I have volunteered myself.

278
00:12:48,811 --> 00:12:49,650
You?

279
00:12:49,856 --> 00:12:51,783
Vwasak elder: Opposing
the Trags can be risky,

280
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:54,054
but your Uncle is prepared to take them on.

281
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:56,244
If you're looking for someone
to carry on my father's message,

282
00:12:56,262 --> 00:12:57,652
that person is not Castor.

283
00:12:57,664 --> 00:12:59,015
Castor: Your father wanted you to lead,

284
00:12:59,028 --> 00:13:00,698
but not if it meant your
life would be in danger.

285
00:13:00,717 --> 00:13:03,332
Don't pretend that you knew what my
father wanted. You were never even...

286
00:13:03,376 --> 00:13:05,473
Your father would want
what is best for our people.

287
00:13:05,523 --> 00:13:07,512
Let the boy speak.

288
00:13:08,826 --> 00:13:11,060
If you ever want to stop the Trags,

289
00:13:11,336 --> 00:13:13,963
we need a leader who's going
to look towards the future.

290
00:13:14,083 --> 00:13:16,978
Castor will only lead our
people backward into violence.

291
00:13:17,191 --> 00:13:19,700
So we should adapt to
be more like the humans?

292
00:13:20,175 --> 00:13:22,284
Even after they murdered your father?

293
00:13:23,810 --> 00:13:26,820
I will not let you tell
me how to honor my father.

294
00:13:28,303 --> 00:13:30,567
But the question still remains.

295
00:13:30,939 --> 00:13:32,657
If not Castor, then

296
00:13:32,682 --> 00:13:35,460
who will lead our people
and stand up to the Trags?

297
00:13:40,458 --> 00:13:41,546
I will.

298
00:13:53,728 --> 00:13:56,193
Em, that was amazing.

299
00:13:56,231 --> 00:13:58,214
Like, you were, like, "what up, Red Hawks?

300
00:13:58,221 --> 00:14:00,022
What up, school board? Do not mind me.

301
00:14:00,059 --> 00:14:02,913
I just came by to just drop some
knowledge at your front door."

302
00:14:02,957 --> 00:14:05,340
- It was good. I really enjoyed it.
- What's going on?

303
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:10,164
Right. I may have uploaded
your speech to my vlog.

304
00:14:11,453 --> 00:14:12,686
Oh.

305
00:14:12,688 --> 00:14:14,050
Just so you know,

306
00:14:14,170 --> 00:14:16,171
if those tatties try
something at the carnival,

307
00:14:16,641 --> 00:14:18,442
blood's on your hands.

308
00:14:21,545 --> 00:14:22,796
Don't listen to Eric.

309
00:14:22,798 --> 00:14:24,498
What you did was seriously bad-ass.

310
00:14:24,618 --> 00:14:26,069
Thanks, Zoe.

311
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:35,496
Castor: Roman, our people
need a strong, decisive leader,

312
00:14:35,515 --> 00:14:37,992
who is well-versed in the
politics of the sector.

313
00:14:38,013 --> 00:14:39,812
And that's you? A former Trag?

314
00:14:39,932 --> 00:14:42,071
My father caught you trying to build a bomb

315
00:14:42,101 --> 00:14:43,429
out of fertilizer and gasoline.

316
00:14:43,469 --> 00:14:44,862
I'm not the radical I once was.

317
00:14:44,905 --> 00:14:47,064
But my past... it gave me experience.

318
00:14:47,101 --> 00:14:48,535
And I've built relationships.

319
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:50,638
How long have you been
plotting to replace my father?

320
00:14:50,663 --> 00:14:53,122
No one can replace your father, Roman.

321
00:14:53,341 --> 00:14:55,160
But you are too young to rule.

322
00:14:55,180 --> 00:14:56,757
Based on what?

323
00:14:59,691 --> 00:15:01,106
My whole life,

324
00:15:01,362 --> 00:15:03,735
my father's been grooming
me for this position.

325
00:15:03,746 --> 00:15:05,078
Well, then, as iksen,

326
00:15:05,366 --> 00:15:07,531
how are you gonna harness the Trags?

327
00:15:07,651 --> 00:15:10,778
How are you going to prevent
them from declaring war?

328
00:15:12,997 --> 00:15:15,198
They respected my father.

329
00:15:15,477 --> 00:15:17,623
And they'll respect me.

330
00:15:26,908 --> 00:15:29,610
When an apology comes with fried pickles,

331
00:15:29,730 --> 00:15:32,256
I'm told it's your duty to accept.

332
00:15:32,376 --> 00:15:33,858
But, uh,

333
00:15:34,202 --> 00:15:35,760
what are you apologizing for?

334
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:38,194
For leaving you at the party on Friday.

335
00:15:38,231 --> 00:15:39,502
Don't worry about it.

336
00:15:39,622 --> 00:15:41,216
Take a seat.

337
00:15:45,583 --> 00:15:47,897
I'm sorry to hear about
what happened to your dad.

338
00:15:48,410 --> 00:15:50,294
It sounds like he, uh,

339
00:15:50,363 --> 00:15:51,583
didn't mean to hurt anyone.

340
00:15:51,703 --> 00:15:54,048
I just wish everyone saw it that way.

341
00:15:54,098 --> 00:15:55,424
You mean Roman?

342
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:58,202
When you lose someone close to you,

343
00:15:58,233 --> 00:16:00,010
it can mess with your head for a while.

344
00:16:01,213 --> 00:16:02,632
I can relate.

345
00:16:03,070 --> 00:16:04,089
You can?

346
00:16:05,291 --> 00:16:07,651
I lost my brother ten years ago.

347
00:16:07,653 --> 00:16:09,288
He was in the national guard,

348
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:11,497
and he was killed in action...

349
00:16:11,954 --> 00:16:13,549
on arrival day.

350
00:16:14,432 --> 00:16:17,166
I'm so sorry. I had no idea.

351
00:16:17,210 --> 00:16:19,000
I don't tell many people.

352
00:16:19,231 --> 00:16:20,508
Thanks.

353
00:16:20,683 --> 00:16:21,828
For what?

354
00:16:23,630 --> 00:16:26,152
I'm just glad you told me.

355
00:16:30,650 --> 00:16:32,375
Enjoy the pickles.

356
00:16:34,510 --> 00:16:36,262
- Emery: Hey.
- Julia: Hi.

357
00:16:36,331 --> 00:16:38,547
You are officially my hero.

358
00:16:38,667 --> 00:16:40,283
You saw the video?

359
00:16:40,285 --> 00:16:42,758
Um, everyone saw the video.

360
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:45,210
Hey, how'd it go with Roman today?

361
00:16:45,779 --> 00:16:47,563
He could barely even look at me.

362
00:16:48,163 --> 00:16:50,108
Julia: It's okay, Em.

363
00:16:50,146 --> 00:16:52,029
He's just hurting right now.

364
00:16:52,323 --> 00:16:54,931
But that was one way to get his attention.

365
00:16:55,151 --> 00:16:56,790
Emery: Yeah, I guess so.

366
00:16:58,567 --> 00:17:00,075
Excuse.

367
00:17:00,469 --> 00:17:01,727
(Trilling)

368
00:17:01,847 --> 00:17:03,490
Hey, can I volunteer?

369
00:17:04,129 --> 00:17:06,781
If the Atrians are coming,
I don't want to miss it.

370
00:17:07,532 --> 00:17:10,104
I don't know you, and I know everyone.

371
00:17:10,292 --> 00:17:12,464
- Freshman?
- Junior.

372
00:17:12,925 --> 00:17:16,173
I am down a few ticket scanners.

373
00:17:16,223 --> 00:17:18,488
Some of my volunteers are
boycotting the carnival

374
00:17:18,507 --> 00:17:19,805
if the Atrians attend.

375
00:17:19,925 --> 00:17:21,160
Sorry.

376
00:17:21,178 --> 00:17:22,449
It's their loss.

377
00:17:22,569 --> 00:17:24,996
Homecoming is no place for politics.

378
00:17:31,103 --> 00:17:33,053
(Laughs)

379
00:17:37,174 --> 00:17:38,842
How did it go with the hwatab?

380
00:17:39,061 --> 00:17:41,063
I'll tell you later.

381
00:17:42,147 --> 00:17:43,728
I need to know where Hadar

382
00:17:43,753 --> 00:17:45,637
and the rest of the
Trags are meeting tonight.

383
00:17:45,856 --> 00:17:47,776
Roman, you don't want to
get mixed up in all that.

384
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:50,304
(Laughs) I don't really have a choice.

385
00:17:50,317 --> 00:17:52,069
My mother said there's
a lot of heat on them

386
00:17:52,088 --> 00:17:53,445
- after last night's bombing.
- Teri.

387
00:17:53,477 --> 00:17:54,340
(Scoffs)

388
00:17:55,178 --> 00:17:56,223
Please.

389
00:17:59,245 --> 00:18:01,304
It's initiation night for
the Trags' new recruits.

390
00:18:01,535 --> 00:18:02,555
Male: They think

391
00:18:02,592 --> 00:18:03,911
they can control us,

392
00:18:05,098 --> 00:18:06,084
imprison us,

393
00:18:06,614 --> 00:18:08,722
murder our leader.

394
00:18:08,842 --> 00:18:11,574
But the tide is turning.

395
00:18:12,515 --> 00:18:13,893
We will show them

396
00:18:13,895 --> 00:18:15,809
that we are not powerless.

397
00:18:16,019 --> 00:18:20,524
Nox fell so that you all could rise up.

398
00:18:20,644 --> 00:18:22,911
(Chanting in native language)

399
00:18:24,438 --> 00:18:26,039
(Gun chambers clicking)

400
00:18:33,677 --> 00:18:36,704
You'd be wise to announce
yourself next time, Roman.

401
00:18:38,468 --> 00:18:41,715
I knew it was only a matter
of time before you came to us.

402
00:18:42,954 --> 00:18:46,170
You're using my father's
death to build an army?

403
00:18:46,402 --> 00:18:49,173
We must show the world what
makes us the superior race.

404
00:18:49,192 --> 00:18:50,286
In case you haven't noticed,

405
00:18:50,317 --> 00:18:52,689
we're outnumbered by
about seven billion people.

406
00:18:53,089 --> 00:18:55,984
A couple of stolen temblor guns
are not going to win this war.

407
00:18:56,387 --> 00:18:59,452
We've been amassing an
arsenal inside the sector.

408
00:19:00,647 --> 00:19:01,817
Where?

409
00:19:01,886 --> 00:19:03,369
Somewhere safe.

410
00:19:04,312 --> 00:19:05,671
As our new iksen,

411
00:19:05,884 --> 00:19:09,648
those weapons are as much
yours as they are ours.

412
00:19:09,669 --> 00:19:11,615
But only if you stand with us.

413
00:19:13,048 --> 00:19:14,371
Do you?

414
00:19:18,423 --> 00:19:19,424
Yes.

415
00:19:19,761 --> 00:19:21,493
I stand with you.

416
00:19:21,613 --> 00:19:25,048
Then tomorrow night, I will
take you to our weapons bunker.

417
00:19:25,317 --> 00:19:27,257
We will arm our people,

418
00:19:27,325 --> 00:19:29,252
and prepare for the uprising.

419
00:19:31,088 --> 00:19:32,422
(Shouting)

420
00:19:32,424 --> 00:19:35,091
(Men chant in native language)

421
00:19:43,211 --> 00:19:45,407
The Atrian seven have done nothing wrong.

422
00:19:45,426 --> 00:19:47,134
Gloria: Local news is all over this.

423
00:19:47,136 --> 00:19:49,384
Shut it off. I'm tired of hearing it.

424
00:19:49,504 --> 00:19:51,082
Because she's right...

425
00:19:51,426 --> 00:19:52,465
And you know it.

426
00:19:52,509 --> 00:19:54,767
All I know is I've got a
gaggle of angry parents calling

427
00:19:54,792 --> 00:19:57,492
for the Atrian seven to be sent
back to the sector for good.

428
00:19:57,514 --> 00:19:58,978
Oh, well, that's not an option.

429
00:19:59,098 --> 00:20:01,758
Not as long as my employers
in D.C. have a vested interest

430
00:20:01,762 --> 00:20:03,295
in seeing this program succeed.

431
00:20:03,318 --> 00:20:05,271
If we invite the Atrians to the carnival,

432
00:20:05,272 --> 00:20:07,424
the town might set fire to the school.

433
00:20:07,943 --> 00:20:09,955
Then I'll build you a new one.

434
00:20:10,402 --> 00:20:12,324
I'm overruling the board, Saul.

435
00:20:12,326 --> 00:20:14,294
Make the announcement.

436
00:20:16,029 --> 00:20:18,203
(School bell ringing)

437
00:20:18,222 --> 00:20:19,911
Saul: Attention, students.

438
00:20:20,031 --> 00:20:22,132
After much discussion, the
school board has decided

439
00:20:22,145 --> 00:20:23,396
to reverse its decision

440
00:20:23,516 --> 00:20:26,837
and allow the Atrian seven to
attend tonight's homecoming carnival.

441
00:20:26,868 --> 00:20:28,376
Boy: Whoa!

442
00:20:28,833 --> 00:20:31,229
- Boy 2: Oh, settle down, man!
- Girl: What's that all about?

443
00:20:31,248 --> 00:20:32,605
What's Eric's problem?

444
00:20:32,912 --> 00:20:34,545
Ugh!

445
00:20:34,547 --> 00:20:37,098
His dad used to own this restaurant.

446
00:20:37,117 --> 00:20:39,938
It was a popular neighborhood
joint over in Bunkhead.

447
00:20:39,985 --> 00:20:41,852
- Where they put the sector?
- Yup.

448
00:20:42,103 --> 00:20:45,038
People stopped coming around,
and the place shut down.

449
00:20:45,357 --> 00:20:48,954
Now, Eric's dad does a lot
of drinking his breakfast.

450
00:20:53,830 --> 00:20:56,833
Hey, I know you have no
reason to listen to me, but

451
00:20:56,834 --> 00:20:58,866
I hope you come to the
homecoming carnival tonight.

452
00:20:59,630 --> 00:21:00,549
So,

453
00:21:00,571 --> 00:21:02,788
you think that if we ride
around in circles together

454
00:21:02,807 --> 00:21:05,190
on wooden horses at high speeds...

455
00:21:05,541 --> 00:21:07,568
- That all of our problems will be solved.
- No,

456
00:21:07,578 --> 00:21:10,089
I... I just wanted to find
a way to bring us together.

457
00:21:10,458 --> 00:21:11,278
All of us.

458
00:21:13,081 --> 00:21:15,020
I heard what you said to the board.

459
00:21:15,070 --> 00:21:17,451
You tried to do a good thing.

460
00:21:17,684 --> 00:21:20,387
This is bigger than the two of us now.

461
00:21:21,871 --> 00:21:23,685
Maybe it's safer if we're apart.

462
00:21:32,933 --> 00:21:35,135
You're sure you won't reconsider
coming to the carnival?

463
00:21:36,756 --> 00:21:38,906
I need to meet with Hadar.

464
00:21:38,908 --> 00:21:41,179
Find out where the Trags
are hiding their weapons.

465
00:21:41,198 --> 00:21:43,488
I need to stop them from arming
every Trag in this sector.

466
00:21:43,507 --> 00:21:45,146
Roman, please be careful.

467
00:21:45,197 --> 00:21:46,648
Don't worry, I'll be fine.

468
00:21:46,768 --> 00:21:48,480
(Indistinct announcement over speakers)

469
00:21:49,163 --> 00:21:50,839
I'm a little surprised
you're going to the carnival.

470
00:21:50,864 --> 00:21:52,322
They shut down Weeble's tunnel.

471
00:21:52,341 --> 00:21:54,160
Got to find another way
to bust out of this slum.

472
00:21:54,168 --> 00:21:56,214
Even if you could escape,
where would you go?

473
00:21:56,239 --> 00:21:58,420
I heard about a place where
all the Atrians who escaped

474
00:21:58,466 --> 00:21:59,807
on arrival day have set up shop.

475
00:21:59,809 --> 00:22:02,103
Deep in the swamplands of Louisiana.

476
00:22:02,132 --> 00:22:04,090
No searches, no seizures. Just freedom.

477
00:22:04,210 --> 00:22:05,817
(Scoffs) I think you've
been smoking too much dovor.

478
00:22:05,842 --> 00:22:07,437
Hey, I'm serious, all right?

479
00:22:07,475 --> 00:22:09,728
These savages want to wipe us all out.

480
00:22:09,730 --> 00:22:11,260
We got to start thinking about
how we're going to make things

481
00:22:11,279 --> 00:22:12,042
better for ourselves.

482
00:22:12,067 --> 00:22:13,444
Remember what my dad said:

483
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:15,046
If we ever want to be treated as equals,

484
00:22:15,064 --> 00:22:17,323
we need to show the humans
there's nothing to fear.

485
00:22:17,342 --> 00:22:19,493
I'll try to remember that while
they're deep frying our toes

486
00:22:19,518 --> 00:22:21,445
and sprinkling them with powdered sugar.

487
00:22:51,665 --> 00:22:53,404
(Door latches shut)

488
00:23:04,421 --> 00:23:07,155
Hadar: We must send the
message that our reach

489
00:23:07,174 --> 00:23:09,276
extends beyond the sector

490
00:23:09,295 --> 00:23:11,008
by taking action tonight.

491
00:23:11,315 --> 00:23:13,205
Not only against those

492
00:23:13,261 --> 00:23:14,975
who have wronged us,

493
00:23:15,232 --> 00:23:16,883
but also those

494
00:23:16,946 --> 00:23:18,785
they care most about.

495
00:23:35,421 --> 00:23:36,529
Castor.

496
00:23:37,285 --> 00:23:39,268
And we'll talk like this
at the meeting. Thank you.

497
00:23:39,650 --> 00:23:40,643
Roman.

498
00:23:41,001 --> 00:23:43,060
The Trags are planning an attack tonight

499
00:23:43,279 --> 00:23:44,461
at the carnival.

500
00:23:44,716 --> 00:23:46,641
- Can you stop it?
- I can try.

501
00:23:46,644 --> 00:23:48,221
But Hadar is also planning

502
00:23:48,228 --> 00:23:49,861
on arming his soldiers inside the sector.

503
00:23:49,901 --> 00:23:50,943
Where?

504
00:23:51,131 --> 00:23:52,489
(Sighs) I don't know.

505
00:23:52,514 --> 00:23:54,297
I convinced him to take
me there later tonight.

506
00:23:54,885 --> 00:23:57,187
But if I leave to stop
the attack at the carnival,

507
00:23:57,307 --> 00:23:59,896
I won't be here to prevent
him from mobilizing his army.

508
00:24:00,016 --> 00:24:02,499
Castor, if you want to prove
to me that you've changed,

509
00:24:02,987 --> 00:24:05,133
you have got to stop Hadar.

510
00:24:07,035 --> 00:24:08,612
Of course I will.

511
00:24:10,364 --> 00:24:11,302
Go.

512
00:24:11,484 --> 00:24:12,741
I got this.

513
00:24:17,245 --> 00:24:19,312
(Laughter)

514
00:24:24,140 --> 00:24:24,803
(Beeps) Hi.

515
00:24:24,834 --> 00:24:25,803
Thank you.

516
00:24:25,804 --> 00:24:26,980
Let me see. (Beeps)

517
00:24:27,725 --> 00:24:29,064
(Beeps) Have fun.

518
00:24:29,089 --> 00:24:31,303
(Beeps) Thank you.

519
00:24:33,543 --> 00:24:36,159
(Beeping) Do you guys realize
this is my first job ever?

520
00:24:36,334 --> 00:24:37,579
How exciting is that?

521
00:24:37,610 --> 00:24:39,838
Okay, you know that there's
a carnival going on, right?

522
00:24:39,869 --> 00:24:41,070
Like, um, games, rides.

523
00:24:41,076 --> 00:24:42,422
Artery-clogging treats.

524
00:24:42,991 --> 00:24:44,380
Everyone's a little on edge

525
00:24:44,391 --> 00:24:45,938
waiting for the Atrians to arrive.

526
00:24:46,476 --> 00:24:48,222
If they even show up.

527
00:24:49,273 --> 00:24:51,301
Do you still think I did the right thing?

528
00:24:51,421 --> 00:24:53,231
Was this about doing the right thing

529
00:24:53,233 --> 00:24:55,023
or was this about getting Roman alone

530
00:24:55,048 --> 00:24:57,651
so you could, you know, tilt his whirl?

531
00:24:57,705 --> 00:24:59,015
It doesn't matter. He's not coming.

532
00:24:59,077 --> 00:25:00,329
- Hey.
- Hey.

533
00:25:00,736 --> 00:25:03,650
- See you in there?
- Yeah. Sure.

534
00:25:06,434 --> 00:25:07,804
Grayson's a friend.

535
00:25:07,924 --> 00:25:08,999
Mm-hmm.

536
00:25:09,237 --> 00:25:11,552
When I come to school, promise
I can make friends like that?

537

Lukas: Hey, guys.

538
00:25:12,459 --> 00:25:14,374
Here they come.

539
00:25:18,410 --> 00:25:20,950
I thought you said he wasn't coming?

540
00:25:21,827 --> 00:25:24,110
I guess he changed his mind.

(Beeping)

542
00:25:35,303 --> 00:25:38,025
You here to campaign for homecoming king?

543
00:25:38,056 --> 00:25:40,109
You show me your school
spirit, I'll show you mine.

Here,

548
00:26:07,107 --> 00:26:08,790
I got this for you.

549
00:26:11,882 --> 00:26:12,972
Thanks, kid.

550

I was going for phi,

Greek symbol for the golden ratio.

I'm sorry about your dad.

I thought he was really inspiring.

561
00:26:47,781 --> 00:26:48,606
Thanks.

562
00:26:49,276 --> 00:26:52,043
And I am keeping your family in my prayers.

00:26:52,367 --> 00:26:54,538
Oh, right, you guys do that.

564
00:26:54,658 --> 00:26:56,615
- Pray.
- Well, yes, it is the south.

00:27:17,782 --> 00:27:20,128
I see you've had a change of heart.

571
00:27:20,622 --> 00:27:22,304

572
00:27:22,348 --> 00:27:24,173
Emery, you need to leave.

576
00:27:30,745 --> 00:27:32,121
There are a group of Atrians

578
00:27:34,384 --> 00:27:35,817
They've targeted your family.

00:27:36,251 --> 00:27:38,078
But they're in the sector.

580
00:27:38,116 --> 00:27:40,021
Trust me, they're resourceful.

581
00:27:40,023 --> 00:27:41,063
There are guards everywhere.

582
00:27:41,082 --> 00:27:42,533
Don't you think I'm safer in a crowd?

583
00:27:42,802 --> 00:27:44,224
Come on.

584
00:27:50,029 --> 00:27:52,900
Are you still seriously
trying to bang that drum?

why, but that feels good.

00:36:23,783 --> 00:36:25,108
They shipped him to the crate.

722
00:36:25,228 --> 00:36:26,222
You ratted him out?

723
00:36:26,272 --> 00:36:27,392
No, Roman.

724
00:36:27,436 --> 00:36:29,125
I played the politics.

725
00:36:29,582 --> 00:36:32,453
I convinced some of his
more enterprising underlings

726
00:36:32,497 --> 00:36:34,205
that it would be in their best interests

727
00:36:34,236 --> 00:36:35,381
to get rid of Hadar,

728
00:36:35,412 --> 00:36:37,108
make room for themselves at the top.

729
00:36:37,333 --> 00:36:39,029
And they listened to you?

730
00:36:39,149 --> 00:36:40,868
I told you.

731
00:36:41,618 --> 00:36:43,102
I'm not a Trag anymore,

732
00:36:43,587 --> 00:36:45,467
but I have sway over them.

733
00:36:45,673 --> 00:36:47,144
And as the new iksen,

734
00:36:47,550 --> 00:36:49,176
you will need to keep a watchful eye

735
00:36:49,214 --> 00:36:51,222
over the Trags' activities
inside the sector.

736
00:36:51,398 --> 00:36:53,831
I have reason to believe that
they're recruiting Atrians

737
00:36:53,856 --> 00:36:55,678
living outside the sector,

738
00:36:55,798 --> 00:36:58,423
amongst the humans, to join their army.

739
00:36:59,668 --> 00:37:01,801
I need to weed them out.

740
00:37:01,803 --> 00:37:03,810
If that's the case,

741
00:37:03,930 --> 00:37:06,619
war could be coming much
sooner than we thought.

742
00:37:09,576 --> 00:37:11,628
(Sighs)

743
00:37:11,647 --> 00:37:13,987
Right now our people need a leader

744
00:37:14,982 --> 00:37:17,782
who can fully devote
themselves to protecting them.

745
00:37:21,007 --> 00:37:23,215
That's why I'm stepping down.

746
00:37:23,540 --> 00:37:26,025
You will be the new iksen.

747
00:37:29,959 --> 00:37:33,200
I will make you and your father proud.

748
00:37:35,767 --> 00:37:38,281
But know the second
that I doubt your loyalty

749
00:37:38,331 --> 00:37:39,833
you will be replaced.

750
00:37:39,876 --> 00:37:41,159
As I should be.

751
00:37:42,004 --> 00:37:44,708
But I will not let our people down.

752
00:37:48,097 --> 00:37:49,542
One more thing.

753
00:37:49,724 --> 00:37:52,013
I need you to use your
influence over the Trags

754
00:37:52,051 --> 00:37:54,655
to get them to stop targeting
the Whitehill family.

755
00:37:56,031 --> 00:37:57,689
Can you do that?

756
00:37:59,698 --> 00:38:01,431
You have my word.

757
00:38:01,694 --> 00:38:03,333
I'll do what I can, Roman.

758
00:38:18,556 --> 00:38:19,775
Hey.

759
00:38:20,114 --> 00:38:23,065
I didn't get a chance to say
good-bye after the carnival.

760
00:38:23,067 --> 00:38:25,507
Beaumont: We keep with our own kind.

761
00:38:25,957 --> 00:38:26,770
Just know

762
00:38:26,771 --> 00:38:28,685
one of us is always watching.

763
00:38:28,923 --> 00:38:31,900
(Low chatter)

764
00:38:35,592 --> 00:38:36,899
Emery: Roman?

765
00:38:37,019 --> 00:38:38,632
Is everything okay?

766
00:38:42,517 --> 00:38:44,232
It will be.

767
00:38:49,648 --> 00:38:50,987
Hey.

768
00:38:52,176 --> 00:38:53,515
Ready?

769
00:38:53,635 --> 00:38:54,841
Yeah.

770
00:39:11,940 --> 00:39:14,512
Roman knows the closer he
gets to that human girl,

771
00:39:14,632 --> 00:39:17,371
the more vulnerable she becomes
to an attack by the Trags.

772
00:39:17,802 --> 00:39:20,674
Well, unlike the Trags,
I mean no harm to Emery,

773
00:39:20,999 --> 00:39:24,153
but I do have my reasons
to keep those two apart.

774
00:39:24,810 --> 00:39:26,774
You still have spies in the school?

775
00:39:26,894 --> 00:39:28,607
- I do.
- Good.

776
00:39:28,845 --> 00:39:32,229
I need you to tell me every
move those Trags are making.

777
00:39:32,611 --> 00:39:34,544
I know they think that you're their dog,

778
00:39:34,839 --> 00:39:36,509
but you answer to me now.

779
00:39:36,629 --> 00:39:37,929
You understand?

780
00:39:38,386 --> 00:39:40,338
Whatever you say, iksen.

781
00:39:53,631 --> 00:39:56,666

(Engine stops, door opens)

785
00:41:01,494 --> 00:41:02,793
Get in.

786
00:41:13,108 --> 00:41:15,160
You gonna tell me what that was all about?

787
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:17,901
Going after them at a
carnival was too risky.

788
00:41:17,932 --> 00:41:20,647
There were guards everywhere,
and now he's seen your face.

789
00:41:20,767 --> 00:41:21,873
Relax.

790
00:41:22,681 --> 00:41:24,064
Tattie ain't gonna talk.

791
00:41:24,101 --> 00:41:25,596
He's the one trying to escape.

792
00:41:26,584 --> 00:41:29,724
I'm more concerned about you undermining me

793
00:41:29,725 --> 00:41:31,148
in front of my soldiers.

794
00:41:31,148 --> 00:41:33,233
You undermined yourself.
It was a reckless move.

After all, us Red Hawks,

798
00:41:43,366 --> 00:41:45,150
we got to stick together.

799
00:41:45,362 --> 00:41:46,726
Right?
