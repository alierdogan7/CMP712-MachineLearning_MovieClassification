1
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:22,964
In Napoli

2
00:00:23,036 --> 00:00:26,472
Where love is king

3
00:00:26,540 --> 00:00:30,135
When boy meets girl

4
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:33,145
Here's what they say

5
00:00:38,051 --> 00:00:40,315
When the moon hits your eye

6
00:00:40,387 --> 00:00:42,821
Like a big pizza pie

7
00:00:42,889 --> 00:00:45,653
That's amore

8
00:00:47,227 --> 00:00:52,062
When the world seems to shine
like you've had too much wine

9
00:00:56,403 --> 00:00:59,770
Bells will ring
Ting-a-ling-a-ling

10
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:04,106
Then you'll sing "Vita bella"

11
00:01:05,846 --> 00:01:09,782
Hearts will play
Tippy-tippy-tay

12
00:01:09,850 --> 00:01:12,785
Like a gay tarantella.

13
00:01:15,188 --> 00:01:19,784
When the stars make you drool
Just like pasta fazool

14
00:01:24,364 --> 00:01:28,960
When you dance down the street
with a cloud at your feet

15
00:01:29,035 --> 00:01:31,299
You're in love

16
00:01:33,373 --> 00:01:36,137
When you walk in a dream

17
00:01:36,209 --> 00:01:41,146
But you know
you're not dreaming, signore

18
00:01:42,382 --> 00:01:46,978
'Scusa me, but you see
back in old Napoli

19
00:01:47,053 --> 00:01:49,647
That's amore

20
00:02:09,709 --> 00:02:11,142
Lucky fella

21
00:02:57,891 --> 00:02:59,324
He looks great.

22
00:02:59,392 --> 00:03:02,327
That AI Conti is a genius.

23
00:03:04,998 --> 00:03:06,693
I am a genius.

24
00:03:10,337 --> 00:03:13,431
If you're such a genius, how come
you can't keep track of your receipts?

25
00:03:13,507 --> 00:03:17,443
Al, how am I supposed to do
your income tax with this mess here?

26
00:03:17,511 --> 00:03:19,945
Numbers, taxes, receipts--

27
00:03:20,013 --> 00:03:24,677
I make them look better
than they did in real life.

28
00:03:24,751 --> 00:03:27,276
I'm an artistic genius.

29
00:03:27,354 --> 00:03:29,948
Then how come you got butter
on your tie?

30
00:03:32,025 --> 00:03:34,459
Give it here. God.

31
00:03:34,528 --> 00:03:38,089
You know what? I give you this.
You make good coffee.

32
00:03:39,199 --> 00:03:42,134
You're a slob,
but you make good coffee.

33
00:03:42,202 --> 00:03:43,692
Red roses.

34
00:03:44,771 --> 00:03:46,705
Very romantic.

35
00:03:48,775 --> 00:03:53,474
The guy that sends these
really knows what he's doing.

36
00:03:53,547 --> 00:03:55,481
The guy who sends those
spends a lot of money...

37
00:03:55,549 --> 00:03:58,313
on something that ends up
in the garbage.

38
00:03:58,385 --> 00:04:00,751
I'm glad everybody
ain't like you, Loretta.

39
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:04,586
- I'd be out of business.
- What are you talking? I love flowers.

40
00:04:16,670 --> 00:04:18,103
Thanks, Carmine.

41
00:04:25,779 --> 00:04:27,770
- Are you ready?
- Hello, Bobo. How are you tonight?

42
00:04:27,847 --> 00:04:32,614
- Very good, Mr. Johnny.
- We'll both have the Ticino salad.

43
00:04:32,686 --> 00:04:35,382
- And I'll have special fish.
- Good.

44
00:04:35,455 --> 00:04:38,754
You don't want the fish. It's the oily
fish tonight. Not before the plane ride.

45
00:04:38,825 --> 00:04:41,157
Maybe you're right.

46
00:04:41,227 --> 00:04:43,127
We'll have the manicotti.

47
00:04:44,364 --> 00:04:46,127
That will be a base
for your stomach.

48
00:04:46,199 --> 00:04:48,133
You eat that oily fish,
you go up in the air...

49
00:04:48,201 --> 00:04:51,398
halfway to Sicily you'll be green
and your hands will be sweating.

50
00:04:51,471 --> 00:04:52,904
You look after me.

51
00:04:58,678 --> 00:05:01,010
- You're getting very upset.
- I'm bored with this.

52
00:05:01,081 --> 00:05:02,742
- I don't understand.
- Don't ruin the whole evening.

53
00:05:02,816 --> 00:05:05,785
- Patricia, please don't leave.
- Do you think I'm a talking doll?

54
00:05:05,852 --> 00:05:09,344
I was just making a point
about the way you said...

55
00:05:09,422 --> 00:05:12,983
-the way you stated your aspirations.
-You can kiss my aspirations, Professor!

56
00:05:15,328 --> 00:05:18,422
Very clever.
The height of cleverness.

57
00:05:21,067 --> 00:05:22,500
Waiter.

58
00:05:25,038 --> 00:05:28,599
- Yes?
- Would you do away with her dinner...

59
00:05:28,675 --> 00:05:31,439
and any evidence of her,
and bring me a big glass of vodka.

60
00:05:31,511 --> 00:05:33,445
But absolutely.

61
00:05:37,017 --> 00:05:40,714
A man who can't control his woman
is funny.

62
00:05:42,355 --> 00:05:45,586
- She was too young for him.
- What's the matter, Uncle Bobo?

63
00:05:45,659 --> 00:05:48,958
Tonight Mr. Johnny's going
to propose marriage.

64
00:05:49,029 --> 00:05:51,623
- How do you know that?
- He arranged it with me.

65
00:05:51,698 --> 00:05:55,964
When he asks her, he's gonna wave.
Then I serve the champagne.

66
00:05:58,204 --> 00:06:01,298
Good bachelor customer
for 20 years.

67
00:06:13,653 --> 00:06:16,679
- How's things?
- Fine, Bobo. We'll have the check.

68
00:06:16,756 --> 00:06:18,189
No, l--

69
00:06:19,993 --> 00:06:22,757
- I want to see the dessert cart.
- Very good.

70
00:06:22,829 --> 00:06:26,026
- You never have dessert.
- Never is a long time.

71
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:41,738
What's the matter with you?

72
00:06:43,183 --> 00:06:46,084
My scalp is not getting
enough blood sometimes.

73
00:06:47,153 --> 00:06:49,621
- Have some dessert.
- I shouldn't.

74
00:06:49,689 --> 00:06:52,180
- Will you marry me?
- What?

75
00:06:57,363 --> 00:07:01,732
- Bobo, take the cart away.
- Very good, Miss Loretta.

76
00:07:01,801 --> 00:07:04,031
- Are you proposing marriage to me?
- Yes.

77
00:07:06,139 --> 00:07:08,903
All right, you know I was married
and that my husband died...

78
00:07:08,975 --> 00:07:12,069
but what you don't know
is I think he and I had bad luck.

79
00:07:12,145 --> 00:07:15,080
- What do you mean?
- We got married at City Hall.

80
00:07:15,148 --> 00:07:18,379
-It gave bad luck to the whole marriage.
-I don't understand.

81
00:07:18,451 --> 00:07:22,080
Right from the start,
we didn't do it right.

82
00:07:22,155 --> 00:07:25,215
- Could you kneel down?
- On the floor?

83
00:07:25,291 --> 00:07:26,724
Yeah.

84
00:07:26,793 --> 00:07:28,818
- This is a good suit.
- I know that.

85
00:07:28,895 --> 00:07:31,591
I helped you pick it out.
It came with two pairs of pants.

86
00:07:31,664 --> 00:07:36,328
It's for luck. A man proposes marriage
to a woman, he should kneel down.

87
00:07:49,983 --> 00:07:52,577
She's got him on his knees.
He's ruining his suit.

88
00:07:57,023 --> 00:07:58,888
Is that man praying?

89
00:07:59,993 --> 00:08:02,723
- So--
- Where's the ring?

90
00:08:04,631 --> 00:08:06,064
The ring.

91
00:08:06,132 --> 00:08:08,066
A ring. That's right.

92
00:08:08,134 --> 00:08:11,069
I would have sprung for the ring
if it was me.

93
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:15,699
- You can use your pinkie ring.
- I like this ring.

94
00:08:15,775 --> 00:08:19,677
You propose marriage to a woman,
you should offer her an engagement ring.

95
00:08:32,992 --> 00:08:34,823
Loretta Castorini Clark...

96
00:08:35,995 --> 00:08:39,226
on my knees,
in front of all these people...

97
00:08:41,334 --> 00:08:42,801
will you marry me?

98
00:08:42,869 --> 00:08:46,600
Yes, John Anthony Cammareri.

99
00:08:46,673 --> 00:08:49,233
I will marry you.
I will be your wife.

100
00:09:08,828 --> 00:09:11,991
- The check!
- Right away, Mr. Johnny.

101
00:09:23,810 --> 00:09:25,744
What about the wedding?

102
00:09:28,648 --> 00:09:30,582
My mother is dying.

103
00:09:32,051 --> 00:09:34,747
When she's dead,
I'll come back and we'll get married.

104
00:09:34,821 --> 00:09:36,254
How near death is she?

105
00:09:37,824 --> 00:09:40,054
A week. Two weeks.

106
00:09:40,126 --> 00:09:43,186
- No more.
- Let's set a date. How about a month?

107
00:09:43,263 --> 00:09:45,424
Must it be so definite?

108
00:09:45,498 --> 00:09:48,797
Can we just say
we'll be married when I get back?

109
00:09:48,868 --> 00:09:50,392
Where?
At the City Hall? No.

110
00:09:51,738 --> 00:09:53,569
My mother is dying.

111
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:55,767
I want a whole wedding
or we'll have bad luck.

112
00:09:55,842 --> 00:09:59,243
For a whole wedding to be planned,
you gotta set a date.

113
00:09:59,312 --> 00:10:01,576
All right. A month.

114
00:10:01,648 --> 00:10:03,775
- A month from today.
- In a month.

115
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:10,948
- From today.
- I'll take care of the whole thing.

116
00:10:11,024 --> 00:10:12,548
All you gotta do is show up.

117
00:10:21,367 --> 00:10:22,800
Come on.

118
00:10:25,705 --> 00:10:28,538
- Call me when you get in.
- I'll call you from Mama's house.

119
00:10:28,608 --> 00:10:31,475
You make me very happy.

120
00:10:31,544 --> 00:10:34,012
There's one thing about this wedding
I want you to do.

121
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:37,481
I want you to call this number.

122
00:10:37,550 --> 00:10:39,950
It's a business number.
You ask for Ronny.

123
00:10:40,019 --> 00:10:42,681
- Invite him to the wedding.
- Who is it?

124
00:10:42,755 --> 00:10:46,714
- It's my younger brother.
- You got a brother?

125
00:10:46,793 --> 00:10:49,990
We haven't spoken in five years.

126
00:10:50,063 --> 00:10:51,655
There was some bad blood.

127
00:10:51,731 --> 00:10:53,926
I want you to call him
and invite him to the wedding.

128
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,433
- Will you do it?
- Sure.

129
00:10:55,501 --> 00:10:57,435
International Flight 604
for Rome...

130
00:10:57,503 --> 00:11:01,530
with connections to Palermo
is now boarding at Gate 43.

131
00:11:01,607 --> 00:11:03,541
I gotta go.

132
00:11:03,609 --> 00:11:05,839
You got your ticket?

133
00:11:08,848 --> 00:11:12,249
Here, I got you these:
gum and cough drops.

134
00:11:12,318 --> 00:11:14,616
- Gum opens your ears when you chew it.
- Yeah.

135
00:11:14,687 --> 00:11:16,120
I gotta go.

136
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:31,636
This is the last call
for lnternational Flight 604 for Rome.

137
00:11:37,377 --> 00:11:40,813
- You have someone on that plane?
- Yeah, my fiance.

138
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:45,146
I put a curse on that plane.
My sister is on that plane.

139
00:11:45,218 --> 00:11:48,483
I put a curse on that plane
that it's gonna explode...

140
00:11:48,554 --> 00:11:51,489
burn on fire
and fall into the sea.

141
00:11:51,557 --> 00:11:55,152
Fifty years ago,
she stole a man from me.

142
00:11:57,563 --> 00:12:00,930
Today she tells me
that she never loved him...

143
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,935
that she took him
to be strong on me.

144
00:12:04,003 --> 00:12:06,096
Now she's going back to Sicily.

145
00:12:08,341 --> 00:12:12,937
I cursed her that the green
Atlantic water should swallow her up!

146
00:12:13,012 --> 00:12:15,105
I don't believe in curses.

147
00:12:15,181 --> 00:12:17,445
Neither do l.

148
00:12:42,608 --> 00:12:44,542
- Mr. Johnny's, right?
- Yeah.

149
00:12:47,713 --> 00:12:49,806
Good night.
The key's in it.

150
00:12:58,825 --> 00:13:01,692
I've heard that song before.

151
00:13:01,761 --> 00:13:05,595
What are you talking about?
I've seen the way you look at her.

152
00:13:05,665 --> 00:13:07,599
- It isn't right.
- How do I look at her?

153
00:13:07,667 --> 00:13:09,601
- Can I help you?
- A spumante.

154
00:13:09,669 --> 00:13:12,331
- So how do I look at her?
- Like a wolf.

155
00:13:18,344 --> 00:13:22,440
Never seen a wolf in your life.
That's $11.99.

156
00:13:22,515 --> 00:13:26,451
I seen the wolf in everybody
I ever met...

157
00:13:26,519 --> 00:13:28,487
and I see a wolf in you.

158
00:13:30,523 --> 00:13:32,457
That makes 20.
Thanks.

159
00:13:32,525 --> 00:13:34,459
- Have a nice night.
- You too.

160
00:13:34,527 --> 00:13:36,791
- You know what I see in you?
- What?

161
00:13:36,863 --> 00:13:40,390
- The girl I married.
- Come on.

162
00:13:40,466 --> 00:13:42,798
Good night.

163
00:14:21,607 --> 00:14:23,541
Hi, guys.

164
00:14:23,609 --> 00:14:27,272
Sweethearts, how are you?
Guess what happened to me today.

165
00:14:38,191 --> 00:14:40,887
Hey, how long must I wait?

166
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:42,450
Come here!

167
00:14:47,066 --> 00:14:48,795
- Hi, Pop.
- Hi.

168
00:14:48,868 --> 00:14:51,234
- Where's Ma?
- In bed.

169
00:14:51,304 --> 00:14:55,297
- You're not sleeping?
- I can't sleep anymore.

170
00:14:55,374 --> 00:14:57,308
It's too much like death.

171
00:14:58,811 --> 00:15:01,905
Pop, I got news.

172
00:15:01,981 --> 00:15:03,505
All right.

173
00:15:03,583 --> 00:15:08,748
- Let's go into the kitchen.
- Once again I start to pray

174
00:15:08,821 --> 00:15:12,086
Let it please be him

175
00:15:12,158 --> 00:15:16,390
Oh, dear God, it must be him

176
00:15:16,462 --> 00:15:19,090
It must be him

177
00:15:19,165 --> 00:15:22,259
Or I shall die

178
00:15:55,167 --> 00:15:57,135
You look tired, Pop.

179
00:15:59,972 --> 00:16:01,462
What's your news?

180
00:16:04,310 --> 00:16:05,777
I'm getting married.

181
00:16:05,845 --> 00:16:08,245
- Again?
- Yeah.

182
00:16:08,314 --> 00:16:10,248
You did this once before.
It didn't work out.

183
00:16:10,316 --> 00:16:12,250
- The guy died.
- What killed him?

184
00:16:12,318 --> 00:16:14,980
- He got hit by a bus.
- No. Bad luck.

185
00:16:15,054 --> 00:16:17,579
Your mother and I were married
52 years. Nobody died.

186
00:16:17,657 --> 00:16:19,750
You were married two years,
somebody's dead.

187
00:16:19,825 --> 00:16:22,487
Don't get married again.
It don't work out for you.

188
00:16:22,561 --> 00:16:25,689
- Who's the man?
- Johnny Cammareri.

189
00:16:28,334 --> 00:16:31,735
He's a big baby. And why
isn't he here telling me this?

190
00:16:31,804 --> 00:16:33,931
He's flying to Sicily.
His mother is dying.

191
00:16:34,006 --> 00:16:38,272
More bad luck. I don't like his face.
I don't like his lips.

192
00:16:38,344 --> 00:16:40,335
When he smiles, I can't see his teeth.
What is he hiding?

193
00:16:40,413 --> 00:16:42,108
- When are you gonna do it?
- In a month.

194
00:16:42,181 --> 00:16:44,411
- I won't come.
- You gotta give me away.

195
00:16:44,483 --> 00:16:47,281
- I didn't give you away the first time.
- And I had bad luck!

196
00:16:47,353 --> 00:16:50,288
Maybe if you gave me away...

197
00:16:50,356 --> 00:16:52,449
and I got married in a church
in a wedding dress...

198
00:16:52,525 --> 00:16:55,790
instead of down at the City Hall
with strangers outside the door...

199
00:16:55,861 --> 00:16:58,352
then maybe I wouldn't have had
the bad luck I had.

200
00:16:59,799 --> 00:17:01,289
Maybe.

201
00:17:01,367 --> 00:17:04,734
I had no reception,
no wedding cake, no nothing.

202
00:17:06,305 --> 00:17:09,206
Johnny got down on his knees
and proposed to me at the Grand Ticino.

203
00:17:09,275 --> 00:17:11,072
- He did?
- Yeah.

204
00:17:11,143 --> 00:17:14,044
- That don't sound like Johnny.
- Well--

205
00:17:15,114 --> 00:17:17,480
- Where's the ring?
- Here.

206
00:17:17,550 --> 00:17:20,178
It looks stupid.
It's a pinky ring.

207
00:17:20,252 --> 00:17:22,652
- It's a man's ring.
- It's temporary!

208
00:17:22,722 --> 00:17:25,623
Everything is temporary!
That don't excuse nothing!

209
00:17:25,691 --> 00:17:27,454
You're coming?

210
00:17:29,829 --> 00:17:32,423
Let's go tell your mother.

211
00:17:39,438 --> 00:17:40,871
Rose.

212
00:17:48,514 --> 00:17:50,277
Who's dead?

213
00:17:50,349 --> 00:17:52,214
Nobody.

214
00:17:52,284 --> 00:17:54,616
- Loretta's getting married.
- Again?

215
00:17:54,687 --> 00:17:56,951
- Yeah.
- Johnny Cammareri.

216
00:17:57,022 --> 00:17:59,752
- I don't like him.
- You're not gonna marry him, Cosmo.

217
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:03,224
- Do you love him?
- No.

218
00:18:03,295 --> 00:18:05,889
Good. When you love them,
they drive you crazy...

219
00:18:05,965 --> 00:18:08,229
'cause they know they can.

220
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:10,393
- But you like him?
- Yeah.

221
00:18:10,469 --> 00:18:12,061
He's a sweet man, Ma.

222
00:18:12,138 --> 00:18:15,904
This time I'm gonna get married
in a church and have a big reception.

223
00:18:15,975 --> 00:18:17,909
- Who's gonna pay for that?
- Pop.

224
00:18:17,977 --> 00:18:19,911
What?

225
00:18:19,979 --> 00:18:21,571
Father of the bride pays.

226
00:18:21,647 --> 00:18:23,171
I have no money.

227
00:18:23,249 --> 00:18:27,379
- You're rich. You're just cheap.
- I don't want to pay for nothing.

228
00:18:27,453 --> 00:18:29,921
It's your duty as my father
to pay for the wedding.

229
00:18:29,989 --> 00:18:32,082
I won't pay for nothing.

230
00:18:32,158 --> 00:18:34,092
He didn't used to be cheap.

231
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:37,459
He thinks if he holds onto his money,
he will never die.

232
00:18:37,530 --> 00:18:39,430
What's done is done

233
00:18:39,498 --> 00:18:41,932
And I tell myself
don't be a fool

234
00:18:42,001 --> 00:18:46,097
Now he'll play that damn record
and won't touch me when he comes to bed.

235
00:18:46,172 --> 00:18:48,265
Have a lot of fun

236
00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:51,673
It's easy when you play it cool

237
00:19:01,787 --> 00:19:05,382
Look at that old man.
How many dogs has he got?

238
00:19:09,795 --> 00:19:15,324
- Keep your dogs off my lawn.
- Come on.

239
00:19:28,147 --> 00:19:30,672
Don't do that.
She's asleep.

240
00:19:30,749 --> 00:19:34,344
- She's asleep.
- Look all the flowers on Foncica.

241
00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:36,854
My brother sent her a blue flower.

242
00:19:36,922 --> 00:19:40,949
I can only see things in my house.

243
00:19:41,026 --> 00:19:44,928
Things in my house are very bad.
I don't know what to advise my son.

244
00:19:44,997 --> 00:19:48,262
I think he should pay
for the wedding...

245
00:19:48,334 --> 00:19:50,359
but it's important
that he don't look ridiculous.

246
00:19:50,436 --> 00:19:54,338
- Why don't you talk to him?
- I will.

247
00:19:54,406 --> 00:19:56,806
But I must find the right moment.

248
00:19:56,876 --> 00:19:58,810
See that bella luna last night?

249
00:20:03,682 --> 00:20:08,449
The moon brings the woman
to the man.

250
00:21:08,013 --> 00:21:10,948
Upstairs.
Everybody upstairs.

251
00:21:13,085 --> 00:21:14,609
Come on.

252
00:21:40,379 --> 00:21:43,314
- Will you live here?
- No.

253
00:21:43,382 --> 00:21:46,146
- Why not?
- Pop don't like Johnny.

254
00:21:47,386 --> 00:21:49,320
We'll sell the house.

255
00:21:49,388 --> 00:21:51,822
I got married before,
you didn't sell.

256
00:21:51,890 --> 00:21:53,653
Grandma was still alive.

257
00:21:53,726 --> 00:21:58,925
Chiro was still home going to school.
Now he's married, gone to Florida.

258
00:21:58,998 --> 00:22:01,592
If you and Johnny moved in
and had a baby--

259
00:22:01,667 --> 00:22:04,431
Ma, I'm 37 years old.

260
00:22:04,503 --> 00:22:05,936
What's 37?

261
00:22:06,005 --> 00:22:09,441
I didn't have Chiro
till after I was 37.

262
00:22:09,508 --> 00:22:11,772
It ain't over till it's over.

263
00:22:14,013 --> 00:22:17,107
Johnny's got a big apartment.
We'll move in there.

264
00:22:17,182 --> 00:22:19,275
So we'll sell the house.

265
00:22:19,351 --> 00:22:22,616
You know-- What-- I want to live here.
I love the house.

266
00:22:22,688 --> 00:22:25,122
Pop don't like Johnny.

267
00:22:25,190 --> 00:22:26,623
No, he don't.

268
00:22:30,429 --> 00:22:31,862
I'll get it.

269
00:22:35,534 --> 00:22:36,967
Hello?

270
00:22:39,371 --> 00:22:42,306
Yeah, this is Loretta Castorini.

271
00:22:47,379 --> 00:22:48,846
Hello, operator?

272
00:22:51,550 --> 00:22:55,316
- Yeah.
- Yes. Shh! It's me.

273
00:22:56,722 --> 00:22:58,883
I'm calling from the death bed
of my mother.

274
00:22:58,957 --> 00:23:01,152
Yeah, how was your plane ride?

275
00:23:01,226 --> 00:23:04,753
The waitresses were very nice.

276
00:23:04,830 --> 00:23:08,527
- My mother is slipping away.
- How long do I have to wait?

277
00:23:17,609 --> 00:23:21,306
-I can't talk long.
-Did you tell her we're getting married?

278
00:23:21,380 --> 00:23:26,909
No, not yet. I'm waiting
till a moment when she's peaceful.

279
00:23:26,985 --> 00:23:29,146
Well, don't wait till she's dead.

280
00:23:29,221 --> 00:23:30,711
Have you called my brother?

281
00:23:30,789 --> 00:23:33,622
No. I'm sorry. Not yet.
I forgot.

282
00:23:33,692 --> 00:23:36,525
- Will you do it today?
- Yes.

283
00:23:36,595 --> 00:23:39,621
Make sure he comes to the wedding.

284
00:23:39,698 --> 00:23:42,792
Five years is too long
for bad blood between brothers.

285
00:23:42,868 --> 00:23:45,803
Nothing can replace the family.

286
00:23:47,372 --> 00:23:48,839
I can see that now.

287
00:23:51,009 --> 00:23:52,772
Loretta, are you there?

288
00:23:54,046 --> 00:23:56,310
I'm sorry.
I'll do it today.

289
00:23:56,381 --> 00:23:58,542
And listen, Johnny.

290
00:23:58,617 --> 00:24:02,417
- Call me after you tell her.
- All right.

291
00:24:02,488 --> 00:24:07,391
And don't stand directly under the sun.
You got a hat. Use your hat.

292
00:24:07,459 --> 00:24:11,259
I got my hat.
All right. Bye.

293
00:24:11,330 --> 00:24:12,820
All right. Bye-bye.

294
00:24:14,166 --> 00:24:16,430
What did I do with that card?

295
00:24:17,636 --> 00:24:19,695
How's the mother?

296
00:24:19,772 --> 00:24:22,536
She's dying, but I could still
hear her big mouth.

297
00:24:45,497 --> 00:24:47,397
He didn't tell her.

298
00:24:47,466 --> 00:24:50,799
You know,
the woman makes him crazy.

299
00:24:50,869 --> 00:24:52,632
Now who you calling?

300
00:24:57,643 --> 00:24:59,076
Cammareri's.

301
00:24:59,144 --> 00:25:02,272
Is Ronny Cammareri there, please?

302
00:25:02,347 --> 00:25:03,780
Hold on.

303
00:25:03,849 --> 00:25:05,817
Ronny, the phone!

304
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:09,617
Yeah, this is Ronny.

305
00:25:09,688 --> 00:25:13,920
Yeah, I'm calling for your brother.

306
00:25:13,992 --> 00:25:16,756
He's getting married,
and he would like it if you would come.

307
00:25:16,829 --> 00:25:18,490
Why didn't he call himself?

308
00:25:18,564 --> 00:25:20,964
- He's in Palermo.
- What's wrong can never be made right.

309
00:25:21,033 --> 00:25:23,866
Look, just let me come
and talk--

310
00:25:23,936 --> 00:25:27,269
Talk to you! Animal!

311
00:25:27,339 --> 00:25:28,829
What an animal!

312
00:25:51,196 --> 00:25:53,130
Thanks, Mrs. Fugocci.

313
00:25:53,198 --> 00:25:55,962
Here you go.
Bye. See you tomorrow.

314
00:25:56,034 --> 00:25:57,968
- Bye.
- Come on, honey.

315
00:25:58,036 --> 00:26:01,028
- Is Ronny Cammareri here?
- He's down at the ovens.

316
00:26:01,106 --> 00:26:03,768
- What do you want?
- I want to talk to him.

317
00:26:14,319 --> 00:26:15,752
This way.

318
00:26:22,828 --> 00:26:25,262
- What?
- Somebody here to see Ronny.

319
00:26:26,932 --> 00:26:29,833
Somebody wants to see you!

320
00:26:49,922 --> 00:26:53,619
- You come for my brother Johnny?
- Yeah.

321
00:26:53,692 --> 00:26:55,592
Why?

322
00:26:55,661 --> 00:26:57,652
We're gonna get married.

323
00:27:01,300 --> 00:27:04,701
- You're gonna marry my brother Johnny?
- Yeah.

324
00:27:04,770 --> 00:27:06,397
Would you like to go someplace
so we could talk--

325
00:27:06,471 --> 00:27:09,031
- I have no life.
- Excuse me?

326
00:27:11,643 --> 00:27:14,111
My brother Johnny
took my life from me.

327
00:27:15,647 --> 00:27:17,308
I don't understand you.

328
00:27:17,382 --> 00:27:21,978
And now he's getting married.
He has his.

329
00:27:23,855 --> 00:27:27,416
He's getting his,
and he wants me to come.

330
00:27:28,961 --> 00:27:30,394
What is life?

331
00:27:30,462 --> 00:27:34,125
- I didn't come here to upset you.
- They say bread is life.

332
00:27:35,334 --> 00:27:38,997
And I bake bread, bread, bread.

333
00:27:39,071 --> 00:27:42,507
I sweat
and shovel this stinking dough...

334
00:27:42,574 --> 00:27:45,134
in and out of this hot hole
in the wall...

335
00:27:45,210 --> 00:27:50,011
and I should be so happy, huh, sweetie?

336
00:27:50,082 --> 00:27:52,642
You want me to come to the wedding
of my brother Johnny?

337
00:27:55,954 --> 00:27:57,581
Where's my wedding?

338
00:27:58,957 --> 00:28:02,723
Chrissy, bring me the big knife
over by the wall.

339
00:28:05,263 --> 00:28:06,958
I'm gonna cut my throat!

340
00:28:07,032 --> 00:28:09,523
Maybe I should come back
another time.

341
00:28:09,601 --> 00:28:12,263
No, I want you to see this.
I want you...

342
00:28:12,337 --> 00:28:14,805
to watch me kill myself
so you can tell my brother Johnny...

343
00:28:14,873 --> 00:28:17,706
on his wedding day, okay?

344
00:28:19,845 --> 00:28:21,506
I won't do it!

345
00:28:21,580 --> 00:28:24,310
She won't do it.
Do you know about me?

346
00:28:24,383 --> 00:28:26,180
- Mr. Cammareri--
- What?

347
00:28:31,456 --> 00:28:33,481
Okay.

348
00:28:33,558 --> 00:28:39,155
Nothing is anybody's fault,
but things happen.

349
00:28:39,231 --> 00:28:40,664
Look.

350
00:28:43,602 --> 00:28:46,765
This wood is fake.

351
00:28:46,838 --> 00:28:49,363
Five years ago,
I was engaged to be married...

352
00:28:49,441 --> 00:28:52,899
and Johnny came in here
and ordered bread from me.

353
00:28:52,978 --> 00:28:54,946
I said, "Okay, some bread."

354
00:28:55,013 --> 00:28:58,312
And I put my hand in the slicer...

355
00:28:58,383 --> 00:29:01,511
and it got caught
'cause I wasn't paying attention.

356
00:29:01,586 --> 00:29:04,987
The slicer chewed off my hand.

357
00:29:05,057 --> 00:29:08,390
It's funny, 'cause when my fiance
found out about it...

358
00:29:08,460 --> 00:29:12,294
when she found out I had been maimed,
she left me for another man.

359
00:29:14,099 --> 00:29:16,067
That's the bad blood
between you and Johnny?

360
00:29:16,134 --> 00:29:17,863
Yes, that's it.

361
00:29:17,936 --> 00:29:20,166
But that's not Johnny's fault.

362
00:29:22,541 --> 00:29:26,033
I don't care!
I ain't no freaking monument to justice!

363
00:29:26,111 --> 00:29:29,979
I lost my hand!
I lost my bride!

364
00:29:30,048 --> 00:29:32,744
Johnny has his hand!
Johnny has his bride!

365
00:29:32,818 --> 00:29:35,878
You want me to take my heartbreak,
put it away and forget it?

366
00:29:48,533 --> 00:29:51,195
Is it just a matter of time...

367
00:29:51,269 --> 00:29:53,703
before a man opens his eyes...

368
00:29:55,407 --> 00:29:57,602
and gives up his one...

369
00:30:00,078 --> 00:30:05,038
dream of happiness?

370
00:30:13,258 --> 00:30:14,691
Maybe.

371
00:30:35,113 --> 00:30:38,207
This is the most tormented man
I have ever known.

372
00:30:38,283 --> 00:30:39,750
I'm in love with this man...

373
00:30:39,818 --> 00:30:42,981
but he doesn't know that.

374
00:30:43,054 --> 00:30:45,648
I never told him,
'cause he could never love anybody...

375
00:30:45,724 --> 00:30:48,022
since he lost his hand
and his girl.

376
00:30:54,633 --> 00:30:56,567
Where do you live?

377
00:30:59,838 --> 00:31:01,271
Upstairs.

378
00:31:02,474 --> 00:31:04,408
Can we just talk?

379
00:31:29,768 --> 00:31:32,464
What are we painting here,
the Sistine Chapel?

380
00:31:32,537 --> 00:31:35,768
We should have been plumbers
like Castorini.

381
00:31:52,891 --> 00:31:54,324
What do you think?

382
00:32:00,832 --> 00:32:02,595
Ten thousand eight hundred dollars.

383
00:32:02,667 --> 00:32:05,101
That seems like a lot.

384
00:32:10,141 --> 00:32:11,574
Look...

385
00:32:11,643 --> 00:32:13,941
there are three kinds of pipe.

386
00:32:14,012 --> 00:32:17,106
There's the kind of pipe you have,
which is garbage.

387
00:32:17,182 --> 00:32:19,116
You can see
where that's gotten you.

388
00:32:19,184 --> 00:32:21,948
Then there's bronze,
which is very good.

389
00:32:22,020 --> 00:32:23,612
Unless something goes wrong...

390
00:32:23,688 --> 00:32:26,885
and something always goes wrong.

391
00:32:26,958 --> 00:32:32,123
Then there's copper,
which is the only pipe I use.

392
00:32:32,197 --> 00:32:37,260
It costs money
because it saves money.

393
00:32:40,372 --> 00:32:45,969
I think we should follow
Mr. Castorini's advice.

394
00:32:46,044 --> 00:32:47,477
Yeah.

395
00:32:56,554 --> 00:32:59,751
And then there's copper...

396
00:32:59,824 --> 00:33:02,759
which is the only pipe I use.

397
00:33:02,827 --> 00:33:04,920
It costs money.

398
00:33:04,996 --> 00:33:07,260
It costs money because...

399
00:33:07,332 --> 00:33:09,596
it saves money.

400
00:33:09,668 --> 00:33:15,265
- What did they say?
- The man understood me.

401
00:33:15,340 --> 00:33:19,242
The woman wanted to be cheap,
but the man saw I was right.

402
00:33:20,578 --> 00:33:24,708
You have such a head for knowing.
You know everything.

403
00:33:31,690 --> 00:33:34,750
I brought you something.

404
00:33:34,826 --> 00:33:37,124
It's a present.

405
00:33:45,937 --> 00:33:48,804
Oh, my God.

406
00:33:48,873 --> 00:33:52,365
They're little birds and stars.

407
00:33:54,212 --> 00:33:58,205
Birds fly to the stars I guess.

408
00:34:41,626 --> 00:34:44,959
- What's that smell?
- I'm making you a steak.

409
00:34:45,029 --> 00:34:47,429
- I don't want it.
- You'll eat it.

410
00:34:48,533 --> 00:34:50,296
I like it well-done!

411
00:34:50,368 --> 00:34:54,236
You'll eat this one bloody
to feed your blood.

412
00:35:09,654 --> 00:35:11,349
This is good.

413
00:35:14,492 --> 00:35:17,086
- Where'd Johnny find you?
- He knew my husband who died.

414
00:35:17,162 --> 00:35:18,595
- How'd he die?
- A bus hit him.

415
00:35:18,663 --> 00:35:20,756
- Fast?
- Instantaneous.

416
00:35:20,832 --> 00:35:23,960
- When'd you get engaged?
- Yesterday.

417
00:35:24,035 --> 00:35:29,234
So five years ago you got your hand
cut off and your woman left you.

418
00:35:29,307 --> 00:35:30,968
- No woman since then?
- No.

419
00:35:32,043 --> 00:35:37,106
- Stupid.
- When your husband get hit?

420
00:35:37,182 --> 00:35:39,116
Seven years ago.

421
00:35:39,184 --> 00:35:41,675
- How many men since then?
- Just Johnny.

422
00:35:42,787 --> 00:35:45,278
- Stupid yourself.
- Unlucky.

423
00:35:45,356 --> 00:35:47,620
- I've not been lucky.
- I don't care about luck.

424
00:35:47,692 --> 00:35:51,958
You understand me?
It ain't that.

425
00:35:52,030 --> 00:35:56,467
What's the matter with you? You think
you're the only one who shed a tear?

426
00:35:56,534 --> 00:35:58,161
Why are you talking to me?

427
00:36:04,809 --> 00:36:07,744
You got any whiskey? How about
you get me a glass of whiskey?

428
00:36:25,497 --> 00:36:27,089
I'll call you later.

429
00:36:51,022 --> 00:36:54,788
- She was right to leave me.
- You think so?

430
00:36:54,859 --> 00:36:59,387
- Yeah.
- You really are stupid.

431
00:36:59,464 --> 00:37:02,900
You don't know nothing about it.

432
00:37:05,303 --> 00:37:09,399
Look, I was raised
that a girl gets married young.

433
00:37:09,474 --> 00:37:11,066
I held out for love.

434
00:37:11,142 --> 00:37:13,235
I got married when I was 28.

435
00:37:13,311 --> 00:37:16,712
I met a man. I loved him.
I married him.

436
00:37:16,781 --> 00:37:19,477
He wanted to have a baby right away.
I said we should wait.

437
00:37:19,551 --> 00:37:22,076
Then he gets hit by a bus.

438
00:37:22,153 --> 00:37:25,145
What do I got?
No man, no baby, no nothing.

439
00:37:25,223 --> 00:37:28,750
How did I know that man
was a gift I couldn't keep.

440
00:37:28,826 --> 00:37:30,919
My one chance at happiness.

441
00:37:30,995 --> 00:37:34,260
You tell me the story, and you
act like you know what it means...

442
00:37:34,332 --> 00:37:36,892
but I can see what
the true story is and you can't.

443
00:37:36,968 --> 00:37:39,596
That woman didn't leave you, okay?

444
00:37:39,671 --> 00:37:43,437
You can't see what you are,
and I see everything. You're a wolf.

445
00:37:44,842 --> 00:37:47,106
- I'm a wolf?
- Yeah.

446
00:37:47,178 --> 00:37:51,945
The big part of you has no words,
and it's a wolf.

447
00:37:52,016 --> 00:37:54,780
That woman was a trap for you. She
caught you, and you couldn't get away...

448
00:37:54,852 --> 00:37:57,548
so you chewed off your own foot.

449
00:37:57,622 --> 00:37:59,715
That was the price
you had to pay for your freedom.

450
00:37:59,791 --> 00:38:01,725
Johnny had nothing to do with it.

451
00:38:01,793 --> 00:38:04,125
You did what you had to do
between you and you.

452
00:38:04,195 --> 00:38:06,186
And now you're afraid...

453
00:38:06,264 --> 00:38:08,129
because you know
the big part of you is a wolf...

454
00:38:08,199 --> 00:38:10,394
that has the courage
to bite off its own hand...

455
00:38:10,468 --> 00:38:12,902
to save itself from the trap
of the wrong love.

456
00:38:12,971 --> 00:38:16,429
That's why there's been no woman
since that wrong woman. Okay?

457
00:38:16,507 --> 00:38:18,737
You're scared to death
of what the wolf will do...

458
00:38:18,810 --> 00:38:21,244
- if you make that mistake again.
- What are you doing?

459
00:38:21,312 --> 00:38:23,610
- I'm telling you your life.
- Stop it.

460
00:38:23,681 --> 00:38:25,876
Why are you marrying Johnny?
He's a fool!

461
00:38:25,950 --> 00:38:28,111
Because I have no luck.

462
00:38:29,654 --> 00:38:33,590
He made me look the wrong way,
and I cut off my hand!

463
00:38:33,658 --> 00:38:36,252
He could make you look the wrong way.
You could lose your whole head!

464
00:38:36,327 --> 00:38:38,295
I'm looking where I have to
to become a bride!

465
00:38:38,363 --> 00:38:42,459
- A bride without a head!
- A wolf without a foot!

466
00:38:57,515 --> 00:38:59,210
Wait a minute!

467
00:39:11,796 --> 00:39:13,525
What are you doing?

468
00:39:13,598 --> 00:39:15,031
Son of a bitch!

469
00:39:15,099 --> 00:39:18,034
Where are you taking me?

470
00:39:18,102 --> 00:39:19,535
To the bed.

471
00:39:20,638 --> 00:39:23,232
Oh, God.
Okay, I don't care.

472
00:39:23,307 --> 00:39:25,571
Take me to the bed.

473
00:39:25,643 --> 00:39:28,669
- I don't care about anything.
- I don't believe this is happening.

474
00:39:32,650 --> 00:39:34,743
- I was dead.
- Me too.

475
00:39:39,691 --> 00:39:41,921
- What about Johnny?
- You're mad at him.

476
00:39:41,993 --> 00:39:44,826
Take your revenge
out on me.

477
00:39:44,896 --> 00:39:46,830
Leave nothing left
for him to marry.

478
00:39:46,898 --> 00:39:49,924
Leave nothing
but the skin over my bones.

479
00:39:50,001 --> 00:39:53,266
All right.
There will be nothing left.

480
00:40:09,954 --> 00:40:11,285
Let's eat while it's hot.

481
00:40:11,355 --> 00:40:13,346
Where's Loretta?
We're eating without her?

482
00:40:13,424 --> 00:40:16,552
- She must be eating out.
- She don't know what she's missing.

483
00:40:16,627 --> 00:40:18,788
It's not like her not to call.

484
00:40:18,863 --> 00:40:22,629
She's got a lot on her mind.
We can talk about her, right?

485
00:40:22,700 --> 00:40:25,999
- Everybody knows she's getting married.
- I don't want to talk about it.

486
00:40:29,474 --> 00:40:33,069
I think it's a great idea
and about time.

487
00:40:33,144 --> 00:40:36,636
What's she gonna do with the rest
of her life if she don't get married?

488
00:40:36,714 --> 00:40:39,444
I don't want to talk about it!

489
00:40:41,219 --> 00:40:43,244
My father needs another plate.

490
00:40:47,091 --> 00:40:50,583
Many years ago,
when they told me...

491
00:40:50,661 --> 00:40:53,152
you were marrying my sister...

492
00:40:53,231 --> 00:40:54,823
I was happy.

493
00:40:54,899 --> 00:40:56,423
When I told Rose...

494
00:40:56,501 --> 00:40:58,196
that I was marrying Rita...

495
00:40:58,269 --> 00:41:00,134
she was happy.

496
00:41:00,204 --> 00:41:02,604
Marriage is happy news, right?

497
00:41:04,842 --> 00:41:06,833
Rose, pass the wine.

498
00:41:08,946 --> 00:41:12,404
I never seen anybody so in love...

499
00:41:12,483 --> 00:41:15,281
Iike Cosmo was back then.

500
00:41:15,353 --> 00:41:18,720
He'd stand outside the house all day
looking in the windows.

501
00:41:18,790 --> 00:41:23,056
I never told you this
'cause it's not really a story...

502
00:41:23,127 --> 00:41:26,585
but one time I woke up
in the middle of the night...

503
00:41:26,664 --> 00:41:29,258
'cause of this bright light
in my face...

504
00:41:29,333 --> 00:41:30,960
Iike a flashlight.

505
00:41:31,035 --> 00:41:32,900
I couldn't think what it was.

506
00:41:32,970 --> 00:41:37,805
I looked out the window,
and it was the moon...

507
00:41:37,875 --> 00:41:39,934
as big as a house.

508
00:41:40,011 --> 00:41:43,811
I never seen the moon
so big before or since.

509
00:41:43,881 --> 00:41:47,317
I was almost scared,
like it was gonna crush the house.

510
00:41:47,385 --> 00:41:49,148
Then I looked down...

511
00:41:49,220 --> 00:41:51,688
and standing there in the street
was Cosmo...

512
00:41:51,756 --> 00:41:54,316
Iooking up at the windows.

513
00:41:54,392 --> 00:41:56,792
This is the funny part.

514
00:41:56,861 --> 00:41:58,852
I got mad at you, Cosmo.

515
00:41:58,930 --> 00:42:02,422
I thought you had brought
that big moon over to my house...

516
00:42:02,500 --> 00:42:05,025
'cause you were so in love...

517
00:42:05,102 --> 00:42:07,002
and woke me up with it.

518
00:42:07,071 --> 00:42:09,369
I was half asleep I guess.
I didn't know any better.

519
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:12,773
You were altogether asleep.
You were dreaming.

520
00:42:16,314 --> 00:42:17,747
You were there.

521
00:42:18,816 --> 00:42:20,283
I don't want to talk about it.

522
00:42:20,351 --> 00:42:22,615
What do you want to talk about?

523
00:42:22,687 --> 00:42:25,121
Why are you drinking so much?

524
00:42:26,858 --> 00:42:30,385
Old man, you give those dogs
another piece of my food...

525
00:42:30,461 --> 00:42:33,396
I'll kick you
till you're dead.

526
00:43:18,676 --> 00:43:20,769
You drank too much.

527
00:43:20,845 --> 00:43:25,282
You'll sleep too hard, and later
you'll be up when you should be down.

528
00:44:16,834 --> 00:44:20,770
- What's the matter?
- Nothing. I'm looking at the moon.

529
00:44:29,847 --> 00:44:31,280
It's perfect.

530
00:44:31,349 --> 00:44:33,749
I never seen a moon
like that before.

531
00:44:36,187 --> 00:44:38,621
Makes you look like an angel.

532
00:44:42,393 --> 00:44:46,955
Looks like a giant snowball.

533
00:44:49,166 --> 00:44:51,293
- Rita.
- What?

534
00:44:51,369 --> 00:44:54,634
Rita, dear, wake up.

535
00:44:57,708 --> 00:44:59,141
Look.

536
00:45:02,813 --> 00:45:06,078
It's Cosmo's moon.

537
00:45:06,150 --> 00:45:10,746
What are you talking about?
Cosmo can't own the moon.

538
00:45:10,821 --> 00:45:15,417
It's that moon
I was talking about at dinner.

539
00:45:25,836 --> 00:45:27,326
Is he down there?

540
00:45:27,405 --> 00:45:29,236
Is who down there?

541
00:45:31,876 --> 00:45:35,778
- What would he be doing down there?
- I don't know.

542
00:45:41,519 --> 00:45:44,454
You know something?

543
00:45:44,522 --> 00:45:47,116
In that light...

544
00:45:47,191 --> 00:45:49,455
with that expression
on your face...

545
00:45:51,195 --> 00:45:53,254
you look about 25 years old.

546
00:46:11,649 --> 00:46:14,584
What do you want?

547
00:46:18,823 --> 00:46:20,757
Get out.
