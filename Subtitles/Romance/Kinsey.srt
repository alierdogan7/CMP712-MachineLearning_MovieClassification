1
00:00:27,027 --> 00:00:28,927
<i>Don't sit so far away.</i>

2
00:00:29,029 --> 00:00:32,931
<i>- Anything that creates</i>
<i>a distance should be avoided.</i>
<i>- Okay.</i>

3
00:00:37,037 --> 00:00:38,937
<i>And try not to frown.</i>

4
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:41,940
- I'm sorry. Was I frowning?
<i>- You have to relax.</i>

5
00:00:42,042 --> 00:00:45,102
<i>How can I be expected to open up</i>
<i>if you're not relaxed?</i>

6
00:00:45,211 --> 00:00:47,111
- Right.
<i>- Take a deep breath.</i>

7
00:00:47,213 --> 00:00:49,113
<i>Start again.</i>

8
00:00:51,217 --> 00:00:54,618
As you can see, this piece of paper
has been divided into squares.

9
00:00:54,721 --> 00:00:56,780
There are 287 of them.

10
00:00:56,890 --> 00:01:00,291
Your sex history will fit
on this single page in a cryptic code.

11
00:01:00,393 --> 00:01:03,385
<i>Don't forget to mention that</i>
<i>there's no written key to the code.</i>

12
00:01:03,496 --> 00:01:05,896
<i>The interview subject</i>
<i>will only be candid...</i>

13
00:01:05,999 --> 00:01:08,968
<i>if he knows he's speaking</i>
<i>in the strictest confidence.</i>

14
00:01:10,003 --> 00:01:12,631
Right. Okay.

15
00:01:14,841 --> 00:01:16,741
So, when were you born?

16
00:01:16,843 --> 00:01:18,777
<i>June 23, 1894.</i>

17
00:01:20,613 --> 00:01:22,308
Are you single or married?

18
00:01:22,415 --> 00:01:24,315
<i>Married.</i>

19
00:01:24,417 --> 00:01:27,409
- What is your race?
- Don't waste time asking the obvious, Martin.

20
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:30,080
<i>- Fill it in yourself.</i>
- What is your religion?

21
00:01:30,190 --> 00:01:33,387
<i>- Methodist.</i>
- How often do you attend church?

22
00:01:33,493 --> 00:01:37,361
<i>Not at all now,</i>
<i>but I did regularly until I was 19.</i>

23
00:01:37,464 --> 00:01:40,763
How did you get along with your father
and mother when you were growing up?

24
00:01:40,867 --> 00:01:42,767
That's a multiple question.

25
00:01:42,869 --> 00:01:45,770
It allows me to ignore any part
I don't want to answer.

26
00:01:45,872 --> 00:01:49,000
- How did you get along with your mother?
- Fine.

27
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:52,101
- We had a close relationship.
- And your father?

28
00:01:54,214 --> 00:01:57,513
How did you get along with your father?

29
00:02:02,989 --> 00:02:06,390
<i>And what are we to do?</i>

30
00:02:06,493 --> 00:02:09,724
<i>We turn away</i>
<i>from matters of the flesh...</i>

31
00:02:09,829 --> 00:02:12,389
<i>and we turn to things...</i>

32
00:02:12,499 --> 00:02:14,467
<i>of the spirit.</i>

33
00:02:17,003 --> 00:02:18,903
<i>Lust...</i>

34
00:02:19,005 --> 00:02:22,065
<i>has a thousand avenues...</i>

35
00:02:22,175 --> 00:02:25,576
the dance hall,
the ice cream parlor...

36
00:02:25,678 --> 00:02:27,578
the tenement saloon...

37
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:30,080
the Turkish bath.

38
00:02:30,183 --> 00:02:32,777
Like the Hydra...

39
00:02:32,886 --> 00:02:36,583
it grows new heads everywhere.

40
00:02:41,361 --> 00:02:44,159
<i>Even the modern inventions</i>
<i>of science...</i>

41
00:02:44,264 --> 00:02:47,529
<i>are used to cultivate immorality.</i>

42
00:02:49,836 --> 00:02:52,100
<i>The gas engine...</i>

43
00:02:52,205 --> 00:02:55,766
has brought us
the automobile joyride...

44
00:02:55,875 --> 00:02:58,366
<i>and an even more</i>
<i>pernicious menace...</i>

45
00:02:58,478 --> 00:03:01,174
<i>the roadside brothel.</i>

46
00:03:02,649 --> 00:03:04,549
<i>Electricity...</i>

47
00:03:04,651 --> 00:03:07,586
<i>has made possible</i>
<i>the degrading picture show.</i>

48
00:03:07,687 --> 00:03:09,587
Because of the telephone...

49
00:03:09,689 --> 00:03:11,589
a young woman...

50
00:03:11,691 --> 00:03:14,990
can hear the voice of her suitor...

51
00:03:15,094 --> 00:03:18,222
on the pillow, right next to her.

52
00:03:20,333 --> 00:03:24,292
<i>And let's not forget</i>
<i>the most scandalous invention of all...</i>

53
00:03:24,404 --> 00:03:26,736
the talon-slide fastener...

54
00:03:26,839 --> 00:03:29,137
otherwise known as the zipper...

55
00:03:29,242 --> 00:03:33,975
which provides every man and boy
speedy access...

56
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,980
to moral oblivion.

57
00:03:36,082 --> 00:03:38,744
<i>Are you currently in good health?</i>

58
00:03:38,851 --> 00:03:40,910
I suppose so. Mm-hmm.

59
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:42,988
What makes you doubtful?

60
00:03:43,089 --> 00:03:44,989
Every doctor I've ever seen.

61
00:03:45,091 --> 00:03:47,491
Early disease left me
with a weakened heart.

62
00:03:47,594 --> 00:03:50,825
Did you have any illnesses
that kept you out of school?

63
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:53,330
I had typhoid fever and rickets.

64
00:03:53,433 --> 00:03:55,333
Also rheumatic fever.

65
00:03:55,435 --> 00:03:58,563
<i>Measles, chicken pox, pneumonia...</i>

66
00:03:58,671 --> 00:04:01,139
<i>and several bouts of influenza.</i>

67
00:04:04,344 --> 00:04:07,006
Pomeroy, what are you doing?

68
00:04:07,113 --> 00:04:08,910
<i>You're worse than Martin.</i>

69
00:04:09,015 --> 00:04:11,006
Never make judgments about people.

70
00:04:11,117 --> 00:04:12,812
I wasn't.

71
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:17,185
Your body posture told me that my list
of ailments made you uncomfortable.

72
00:04:19,292 --> 00:04:22,022
Maybe it did. Sorry.

73
00:04:22,128 --> 00:04:24,358
Maintaining
a nonjudgmental attitude...

74
00:04:24,464 --> 00:04:26,364
is harder than you think.

75
00:04:26,466 --> 00:04:29,367
The best way is to smile,
nod your head...

76
00:04:29,469 --> 00:04:32,233
while looking me directly in the eye.

77
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:35,605
Where were we?

78
00:04:35,708 --> 00:04:37,608
Your health as a boy.

79
00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:42,079
<i>It improved greatly when I</i>
<i>finally discovered the outdoors.</i>

80
00:04:42,181 --> 00:04:45,412
I never got over the excitement
of setting off into the wild...

81
00:04:45,518 --> 00:04:49,181
escaping bed, illness, family.

82
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:51,052
Alone?

83
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:58,196
<i>No. No. Never alone.</i>

84
00:04:58,298 --> 00:05:01,131
<i>I was surrounded by friends.</i>

85
00:05:03,636 --> 00:05:07,265
<i>Being in the outdoors taught me</i>
<i>to rely on my own judgment.</i>

86
00:05:16,049 --> 00:05:18,950
<i>I started to learn about things</i>
<i>by grasping them...</i>

87
00:05:19,052 --> 00:05:21,020
<i>tasting them, looking at them.</i>

88
00:05:22,922 --> 00:05:24,822
<i>- Biology?</i>
<i>- Yes.</i>

89
00:05:24,924 --> 00:05:26,721
<i>Biology.</i>

90
00:05:26,826 --> 00:05:29,056
<i>The science oflife.</i>

91
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:32,598
<i>The fields and woods became</i>
<i>my new place of worship...</i>

92
00:05:32,699 --> 00:05:34,724
<i>my cathedral.</i>

93
00:05:39,272 --> 00:05:43,436
<i>The only sadness they brought</i>
<i>was when I had to leave them.</i>

94
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:50,411
How old were you when you first
tried to pleasure yourself?

95
00:05:50,516 --> 00:05:52,916
No. No. No euphemisms.

96
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:55,419
If you're talking
to a college graduate...

97
00:05:55,521 --> 00:05:57,955
use "masturbation,"
"testicles," "penis"...

98
00:05:58,057 --> 00:06:00,617
<i>"vagina," "vulva,"</i>
<i>"urination," "defecation."</i>

99
00:06:00,727 --> 00:06:03,525
With the lower-level male,
it's "jacking off," "balls"...

100
00:06:03,629 --> 00:06:05,358
<i>"prick," "cunt," "piss," "shit."</i>

101
00:06:07,467 --> 00:06:11,403
I don't know, Gebhard. Maybe your Harvard
degree is too ivory tower for our purposes.

102
00:06:11,504 --> 00:06:13,404
I was brought up out west.

103
00:06:13,506 --> 00:06:16,031
I've rubbed shoulders
with ranchers, miners my whole life.

104
00:06:16,142 --> 00:06:19,270
- And I thought you were
gonna shave that mustache.
- I like it.

105
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:21,313
<i>It's a disguise, a cover-up.</i>

106
00:06:21,414 --> 00:06:24,713
Look at any movie. The villain's
always the one with the mustache.

107
00:06:24,817 --> 00:06:26,785
My wife likes it.

108
00:06:26,886 --> 00:06:29,980
You have a chance to make an important
contribution to knowledge and science.

109
00:06:30,089 --> 00:06:32,990
Are you telling me you'd give that up
for a little facial hair?

110
00:06:33,092 --> 00:06:35,652
Yes, I suppose I am.

111
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:41,132
Ah.

112
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:44,101
Well, keep it trimmed.

113
00:06:45,772 --> 00:06:48,240
Let's get back to masturbation.

114
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:52,242
That's a mating call.

115
00:06:58,551 --> 00:07:01,452
So, how'd you wind up
at the Stevens Institute, Al?

116
00:07:01,554 --> 00:07:04,853
<i>I thought you wanted</i>
<i>to be a biologist.</i>

117
00:07:04,957 --> 00:07:07,858
There are enough scientists
in the worid, son.

118
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:10,986
Engineers
are what society needs now.

119
00:07:15,968 --> 00:07:18,994
I, um...
I had one of the old fits again.

120
00:07:20,606 --> 00:07:22,836
I tried to stop it.

121
00:07:34,987 --> 00:07:40,357
"Any habit which causes the sex fluid
to be discharged must be resisted.

122
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:43,361
"Doctors link it to
an assortment of illnesses...

123
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:49,163
"including insanity,
blindness, epilepsy...

124
00:07:49,268 --> 00:07:51,168
even death."

125
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:54,239
What if it happens
while you're asleep?

126
00:07:56,275 --> 00:07:59,176
"It is said that the loss of one ounce
of seminal fluid...

127
00:07:59,278 --> 00:08:02,247
equals the loss of 40 ounces of blood."

128
00:08:02,348 --> 00:08:05,681
I'm killing myself,
and I'm not even awake.

129
00:08:05,785 --> 00:08:07,753
What are we supposed to do?

130
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:13,190
"Keep your bowels open...

131
00:08:13,292 --> 00:08:15,226
"read the Sermon on the Mount...

132
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:18,229
"sit with your testicles submerged
in a bowl of cold water...

133
00:08:20,633 --> 00:08:23,101
Think of your mother's pure love."

134
00:08:25,938 --> 00:08:27,906
Why don't we pray.

135
00:09:07,013 --> 00:09:07,411
<i>- Come on. Keep firing questions.</i>

136
00:09:07,446 --> 00:09:10,074
<i>- Come on. Keep firing questions.</i>

137
00:09:10,182 --> 00:09:13,379
Extreme rapidity makes it
very difficult for a subject to lie.

138
00:09:13,486 --> 00:09:16,216
How young were you the first time
you had an orgasm while dreaming?

139
00:09:16,322 --> 00:09:19,314
- How frequently did you have wet dreams?
- What did you dream about?

140
00:09:19,425 --> 00:09:22,417
How young were you when you first
experienced hugging or kissing?

141
00:09:22,528 --> 00:09:24,325
- Necking?
- Petting?
- Oral sex?

142
00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:27,991
How young were you when you no longer
thought of your parents' home as your own?

143
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:31,331
<i>Al, it's getting late. Let's make the rounds.</i>

144
00:09:34,707 --> 00:09:37,267
<i>- Al.!</i>
- Be right down!

145
00:09:53,292 --> 00:09:55,192
Pack of Fatimas.

146
00:09:55,294 --> 00:09:59,196
Okay, son. That'll be 15 cents.

147
00:10:03,235 --> 00:10:06,636
You're a criminal, sir. I shall report you
at once to the local authorities.

148
00:10:06,739 --> 00:10:08,639
DearJesus,
a goddamn Protestant.

149
00:10:08,741 --> 00:10:12,507
- Did you not sell this vile weed to a minor?
<i>- What business is that of yours?</i>

150
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:16,514
It is the Lord's work to protect
the young from temptation.

151
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:20,313
- Men like you, sir, men of weak character...
- Get the hell out of my store.

152
00:10:20,419 --> 00:10:24,685
<i>- I've given you proper warning.</i>
<i>- Are offensive to right-thinking</i>
<i>American citizens...</i>

153
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:28,191
Shut up! You know
what you are, Father? A prig.

154
00:10:28,294 --> 00:10:32,321
- Al.
- A skinflint, a petty tyrant and a hypocrite to boot!

155
00:10:32,431 --> 00:10:34,865
You think you matter?
You <i>don't</i> matter.

156
00:10:34,967 --> 00:10:37,435
There's something wrong with him.

157
00:10:37,536 --> 00:10:39,868
- Come on, Al.
- No.

158
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:46,043
Maybe your workload is too heavy.

159
00:10:46,145 --> 00:10:47,510
You could drop mechanical drawing.

160
00:10:47,613 --> 00:10:49,513
I've withdrawn from Stevens.

161
00:10:50,616 --> 00:10:52,516
That's impossible.

162
00:10:52,618 --> 00:10:55,382
I'm a senior member of the faculty.
Someone would've informed me.

163
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:57,183
Why? Everyone there hates you.

164
00:10:57,289 --> 00:11:00,656
I'm going to Bowdoin to study biology.

165
00:11:06,699 --> 00:11:09,361
And how do you intend to pay for that?

166
00:11:09,468 --> 00:11:11,368
They've given me a partial scholarship.

167
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:14,200
And I've socked away
most of my scouting money.

168
00:11:16,308 --> 00:11:18,674
You've become a shady person, Al...

169
00:11:18,778 --> 00:11:20,678
a person who keeps secrets.

170
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:22,611
I had no choice.

171
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:27,219
What a disappointment
you turned out to be.

172
00:11:29,822 --> 00:11:32,950
<i>- How many years</i>
<i>of schooling did you complete?</i>
<i>- Twenty.</i>

173
00:11:33,059 --> 00:11:35,220
After taking my undergraduate degree
at Bowdoin...

174
00:11:35,327 --> 00:11:38,228
I received my doctorate
from the Bussey Institute at Harvard.

175
00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:40,958
<i>I took a position</i>
<i>as assistant professor of zoology...</i>

176
00:11:41,067 --> 00:11:42,967
<i>here at Indiana University.</i>

177
00:11:43,069 --> 00:11:46,038
At first I studied
the <i>Rhaetulus didieri...</i>

178
00:11:46,138 --> 00:11:47,867
<i>or stag beetle.</i>

179
00:11:47,973 --> 00:11:51,374
Then I discovered
a far more fascinating insect.

180
00:11:51,477 --> 00:11:55,641
<i> This is the American</i> Cynipidae,
<i>or gall wasp.</i>

181
00:11:57,183 --> 00:11:58,548
<i>Here the wasp deposits an egg...</i>

182
00:11:58,651 --> 00:12:00,551
into its host plant.

183
00:12:00,653 --> 00:12:02,484
<i>In this case, an oak tree.</i>

184
00:12:04,056 --> 00:12:07,685
<i>The adult wasp chews its way</i>
<i>through the tree...</i>

185
00:12:07,793 --> 00:12:10,193
<i>and copulates.</i>

186
00:12:10,296 --> 00:12:13,823
At which point
it has the good sense to die.

187
00:12:14,934 --> 00:12:16,458
<i>The animal kingdom includes...</i>

188
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:19,902
<i>at least two million insect species.</i>

189
00:12:20,005 --> 00:12:23,736
So, what makes the gall wasp
so fascinating?

190
00:12:24,777 --> 00:12:27,041
I've spent the last three years...

191
00:12:27,146 --> 00:12:30,547
crisscrossing the continent,
collecting gall wasps.

192
00:12:30,649 --> 00:12:33,641
And what have I learned from my tiny friends,
half the size of the household ant?

193
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:35,516
That you need a date.

194
00:12:35,621 --> 00:12:37,919
Shh!

195
00:12:38,023 --> 00:12:42,221
<i>After studying thousands of these pesky</i>
<i>creatures under the microscope...</i>

196
00:12:42,328 --> 00:12:45,923
I've yet to find a single gall wasp
that's the same as another.

197
00:12:46,031 --> 00:12:48,829
<i>In fact, some are</i> so <i>different...</i>

198
00:12:48,934 --> 00:12:50,993
<i>that the offspring of one generation...</i>

199
00:12:51,103 --> 00:12:54,971
bear no more resemblance to their parents
than a sheep bears to a goat.

200
00:12:55,074 --> 00:12:58,134
There are those of us who might
take comfort in this fact.

201
00:13:02,648 --> 00:13:05,378
Consider the implications.

202
00:13:05,484 --> 00:13:10,251
If every single living thing is different
from every other living thing...

203
00:13:10,356 --> 00:13:14,224
then diversity becomes
life's one irreducible fact.

204
00:13:14,326 --> 00:13:16,624
<i>Only variations are real.</i>

205
00:13:16,729 --> 00:13:18,629
And to see them...

206
00:13:18,731 --> 00:13:21,859
you simply have to open your eyes.

207
00:13:39,485 --> 00:13:41,680
Hello. Mind if I sit here?

208
00:13:43,589 --> 00:13:45,352
Why?

209
00:13:45,457 --> 00:13:47,152
Because you're
the only unattached male...

210
00:13:47,259 --> 00:13:49,056
and I'm the only unattached female.

211
00:13:50,896 --> 00:13:52,887
That's very sensible.

212
00:13:54,934 --> 00:13:57,835
A man who cooks. How refreshing.

213
00:13:57,937 --> 00:14:00,838
I picked it up when I went out west
to collect galls.

214
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:04,740
I was gone for 11 months, and I don't think I
saw more than a dozen people the whole time.

215
00:14:04,844 --> 00:14:07,005
- Sounds lonely.
- Oh.

216
00:14:07,112 --> 00:14:08,943
I enjoyed it.

217
00:14:10,549 --> 00:14:12,449
I've been reading up on gall wasps.

218
00:14:12,551 --> 00:14:15,679
- I think I know why they appeal to you.
- Uh-huh.

219
00:14:15,788 --> 00:14:18,689
They have great big wings,
but they can't fly.

220
00:14:18,791 --> 00:14:22,056
They are incapable of getting
from this hill to that hill...

221
00:14:22,161 --> 00:14:24,061
unless it's close enough to walk...

222
00:14:24,163 --> 00:14:26,757
which means it's possible...

223
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:29,801
to retrace each generation's steps,
hill by hill...

224
00:14:29,902 --> 00:14:31,460
by hill by hill...

225
00:14:31,570 --> 00:14:33,970
all the way back
to the very beginning.

226
00:14:34,073 --> 00:14:36,200
The gall wasp Garden of Eden.

227
00:14:37,309 --> 00:14:39,209
That's very interesting, Miss Millen.

228
00:14:39,311 --> 00:14:43,077
You've managed to bridge the gap between Darwin
and the Book of Genesis in a single phrase.

229
00:14:44,416 --> 00:14:46,407
- McMillen.
- Mmm?

230
00:14:46,518 --> 00:14:48,645
- Clara McMillen.
- Oh!

231
00:14:48,754 --> 00:14:50,881
I'm Prok.

232
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:54,448
- Sorry?
- It's a nickname my graduate
students have given me.

233
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:58,052
Pro... fessor K... insey. Prok.

234
00:14:58,163 --> 00:15:01,064
At first I worried that it suggested
an inappropriate level of intimacy...

235
00:15:01,166 --> 00:15:02,997
between teacher and student...

236
00:15:03,102 --> 00:15:05,332
that could lead to
a loss of respect down the line.

237
00:15:05,437 --> 00:15:07,769
I think it just means they like you.

238
00:15:07,873 --> 00:15:11,570
Yes. Eventually I realized that.

239
00:15:14,013 --> 00:15:16,174
Um, tomato bisque and sandwiches?

240
00:15:16,282 --> 00:15:18,910
Please.

241
00:15:59,725 --> 00:16:01,625
<i>Such an impressive collection.</i>

242
00:16:01,727 --> 00:16:04,560
<i>Thanks. They used to be</i>
<i>categorized by period.</i>

243
00:16:04,663 --> 00:16:07,063
<i>But then I rearranged them</i>
<i>alphabetically by composer.</i>

244
00:16:07,166 --> 00:16:09,066
I find it's more efficient.

245
00:16:09,168 --> 00:16:12,569
Did you ever think about playing professionally?
Because you're very good.

246
00:16:12,671 --> 00:16:14,571
Oh, please. Thank you.

247
00:16:14,673 --> 00:16:17,642
But, uh, "very good" isn't good enough.

248
00:16:18,777 --> 00:16:20,745
I got you a present.

249
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:25,109
- Ah!
- Here.

250
00:16:33,325 --> 00:16:35,225
Oh.

251
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:37,386
Oh, how marvelous!

252
00:16:37,496 --> 00:16:39,964
- They're the right size.
- Oh!

253
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,468
Oh!

254
00:16:44,503 --> 00:16:46,801
Oh!

255
00:16:58,984 --> 00:17:01,578
At what age did you first
have premarital intercourse?

256
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:03,917
I didn't.

257
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:07,220
- So, at the time of marriage you were a virgin?
- Yes.

258
00:17:07,326 --> 00:17:09,226
Was your spouse also a virgin?

259
00:17:09,328 --> 00:17:11,091
Yes.

260
00:17:11,196 --> 00:17:13,960
When you got married,
did you want to get married?

261
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,968
Very much.

262
00:17:20,873 --> 00:17:24,400
<i> I see marriage as a lifetime</i>
<i>partnership between equals.</i>

263
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:27,741
<i>You're a brilliant scholar</i>
<i>with a keenly perceptive mind...</i>

264
00:17:27,846 --> 00:17:30,747
<i>and a profound respect for nature.</i>

265
00:17:30,849 --> 00:17:35,081
You're a capable hiker and camper
and a champion swimmer...

266
00:17:35,187 --> 00:17:38,588
and you're the one girl in a million
who's as interested in insects as I am.

267
00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:41,090
To be honest, Prok...

268
00:17:41,193 --> 00:17:43,093
I'm just not sure.

269
00:17:43,195 --> 00:17:45,095
Okay.

270
00:17:45,197 --> 00:17:47,631
- I consider myself a free thinker.
- Yes!

271
00:17:47,733 --> 00:17:49,633
Frankly, I find you a little "churchy."

272
00:17:49,735 --> 00:17:51,930
"Churchy"?

273
00:17:52,037 --> 00:17:54,198
And I've had another proposal.

274
00:17:56,175 --> 00:17:58,575
I'm not saying no. I just need time.

275
00:18:01,747 --> 00:18:03,237
Prok.

276
00:18:03,348 --> 00:18:05,145
I think you're mean!

277
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:08,583
Mean, heartless and cold!

278
00:19:13,852 --> 00:19:15,979
Astounding.

279
00:19:35,073 --> 00:19:37,041
If you'll have me.

280
00:19:56,628 --> 00:19:59,222
<i>A gall wasp in amber.</i>

281
00:20:00,465 --> 00:20:03,866
- How old is it?
- About 80 million years or so.

282
00:20:05,137 --> 00:20:07,697
Does Mrs. Kinsey
like her wedding present?

283
00:20:07,806 --> 00:20:10,274
It's perfect.

284
00:20:49,381 --> 00:20:51,440
- I'm sorry.
- No, no, I...

285
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:53,916
l...

286
00:20:59,825 --> 00:21:01,793
How beautiful.

287
00:21:04,463 --> 00:21:06,431
May I?

288
00:21:29,521 --> 00:21:31,421
I'm sorry.

289
00:21:31,523 --> 00:21:33,718
I'm a little nervous.

290
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:36,660
It's okay. W-We don't have to...

291
00:21:36,762 --> 00:21:39,162
No!

292
00:21:41,199 --> 00:21:43,167
I'm ready.

293
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:11,888
- Forgive me, Mac.
- No, I'm sorry.

294
00:22:11,997 --> 00:22:14,192
It's just... It hurts too much.

295
00:22:28,513 --> 00:22:31,073
<i>It's... It's a long drive to my parents'!</i>

296
00:22:32,617 --> 00:22:34,585
We should get some sleep.

297
00:22:38,056 --> 00:22:41,457
<i>Robert's had a 92</i>
<i>in mechanical drawing...</i>

298
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:44,188
a 95 in mathematics...

299
00:22:44,296 --> 00:22:46,856
<i>and a clean 100...</i>

300
00:22:46,965 --> 00:22:48,865
<i>in shop practice.</i>

301
00:22:48,967 --> 00:22:51,868
<i>Huh. That's splendid, Robert.</i>
<i>Congratulations.</i>

302
00:22:51,970 --> 00:22:54,871
I was worried that his teachers
were showing him favor...

303
00:22:54,973 --> 00:22:56,873
due to my senior position...

304
00:22:56,975 --> 00:22:59,876
but they tell me he is
the most gifted student in his class.

305
00:22:59,978 --> 00:23:02,139
Well, living with the best teacher
at Stevens doesn't hurt, Father.

306
00:23:02,247 --> 00:23:05,273
Oh, please.

307
00:23:05,384 --> 00:23:09,377
<i>At this rate, he'll finish his degree</i>
<i>in, uh, three years.</i>

308
00:23:11,857 --> 00:23:14,792
<i>Al, tell us what</i> you've
<i>been working on.</i>

309
00:23:16,862 --> 00:23:18,989
- Well...
<i>- Don't bother, Al.</i>

310
00:23:19,097 --> 00:23:22,589
<i>She won't be able to follow you.</i>
<i>She's only had a fourth-grade education.</i>

311
00:23:27,305 --> 00:23:29,899
I'm studying gall wasps, Mom.

312
00:23:30,008 --> 00:23:34,468
I've gathered over 100,000 specimens,
which is really only a drop in the bucket.

313
00:23:34,579 --> 00:23:36,240
But my aim is...

314
00:23:36,348 --> 00:23:39,579
<i>Ten years ofhigher education, and he's</i>
<i>still collecting bugs. </i>

315
00:23:45,023 --> 00:23:47,753
Prok's also written a biology textbook.

316
00:23:49,394 --> 00:23:51,157
Really?

317
00:23:51,263 --> 00:23:53,527
It's read in colleges across the country.

318
00:23:54,666 --> 00:23:57,294
<i>It's actually a very good read.</i>

319
00:23:57,402 --> 00:24:00,599
<i>So I assume you plan</i>
<i>to start a family soon.</i>

320
00:24:02,307 --> 00:24:04,867
<i>No, no, I... Don't rush it.</i>

321
00:24:04,976 --> 00:24:08,036
Once you have children, you're
tied down forever... your life is over.

322
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:17,188
What?

323
00:24:19,724 --> 00:24:22,124
I don't know what I expected, exactly...

324
00:24:22,227 --> 00:24:25,128
but he's far worse
than I ever imagined.

325
00:24:25,230 --> 00:24:28,131
He is pretty awful, isn't he?

326
00:24:30,402 --> 00:24:33,166
- "I once read...
- Shh!

327
00:24:34,606 --> 00:24:37,734
"That the decline of the Roman empire...

328
00:24:37,843 --> 00:24:40,971
was the result
of too-frequent bathing."

329
00:24:43,014 --> 00:24:45,175
Shh! Shh!

330
00:24:45,283 --> 00:24:47,251
Shh.

331
00:24:47,352 --> 00:24:49,252
"Some speculate...

332
00:24:49,354 --> 00:24:51,254
"that rampant adultery...

333
00:24:51,356 --> 00:24:54,382
is a possible cause of earthquakes."

334
00:25:07,272 --> 00:25:09,866
I'm sorry you had to witness that.

335
00:25:12,978 --> 00:25:16,846
I think I really fell in love
with you tonight.

336
00:25:18,149 --> 00:25:21,016
Seeing you here.

337
00:25:21,119 --> 00:25:24,350
Do you think
we can make this work, Mac?

338
00:25:25,857 --> 00:25:27,825
I don't know.

339
00:25:30,262 --> 00:25:33,095
I've... I've heard some people...

340
00:25:33,198 --> 00:25:35,758
just don't fit together.

341
00:25:38,069 --> 00:25:40,560
There's no one I'd rather be with.

342
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:44,404
Physically? I mean...

343
00:25:47,546 --> 00:25:50,379
If only there were some way to know.

344
00:25:51,883 --> 00:25:54,784
That's it, Mac.

345
00:25:54,886 --> 00:25:57,787
Every problem has a solution...
even this one.

346
00:25:57,889 --> 00:26:01,655
We just need to talk to someone,
an expert who's studied the matter.

347
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:03,955
What are you doing?

348
00:26:04,062 --> 00:26:06,155
Why waste any more time?

349
00:26:06,264 --> 00:26:10,963
Your hymen shows
an inordinate thickness.

350
00:26:11,069 --> 00:26:14,300
Dr. Kinsey,
how large is your penis?

351
00:26:14,406 --> 00:26:16,636
Excuse me?

352
00:26:16,741 --> 00:26:19,403
<i>When erect, how large is it?</i>

353
00:26:19,511 --> 00:26:23,003
How long from the scrotum?
Here?

354
00:26:25,183 --> 00:26:26,946
Here?

355
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:31,245
Here?

356
00:26:37,262 --> 00:26:39,287
I'm surprised you didn't pass out.

357
00:26:41,566 --> 00:26:43,466
Is there anything we can do?

358
00:26:43,568 --> 00:26:47,026
It's a common-enough problem.
Would you like to take care of it today?

359
00:26:49,975 --> 00:26:51,943
Sure.

360
00:27:22,107 --> 00:27:24,473
- Oh!
- God!

361
00:27:24,576 --> 00:27:26,476
God. God.

362
00:27:26,578 --> 00:27:29,479
<i> What was the maximum number of</i>
<i>times you had intercourse with your spouse...</i>

363
00:27:29,581 --> 00:27:31,310
<i>in any seven-day period?</i>

364
00:27:31,416 --> 00:27:34,476
I'd say... 20 or so.

365
00:27:34,586 --> 00:27:38,682
At least three times a day the first week,
so 21, at a minimum.

366
00:27:38,790 --> 00:27:40,314
Is there tongue kissing during foreplay?

367
00:27:40,425 --> 00:27:42,154
- Yes.
- Yes.

368
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:43,693
- Hand on breast?
- Yes.

369
00:27:43,795 --> 00:27:45,922
- Mouth?
- Hand on female genitalia?

370
00:27:46,031 --> 00:27:47,396
- Hand on penis?
- Yes.

371
00:27:47,499 --> 00:27:49,194
Mouth on female genitalia?

372
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:51,029
- Mouth on penis?
- Yes.

373
00:27:51,136 --> 00:27:52,398
- Yes.
- Yes.

374
00:27:52,504 --> 00:27:54,096
- Yes.
- Yes.

375
00:27:54,205 --> 00:27:56,070
Yes.

376
00:27:56,174 --> 00:27:57,505
Yes, yes, yes.

377
00:27:57,609 --> 00:28:00,510
I became pregnant with Anne in 1923.

378
00:28:00,612 --> 00:28:02,739
I decided to give up my graduate work.

379
00:28:02,847 --> 00:28:06,715
By the time Anne was born,
I had collected over 200,000 gall wasps.

380
00:28:06,818 --> 00:28:08,752
Joan came along a year later.

381
00:28:08,853 --> 00:28:12,448
Just afterJoan's fifth birthday,
I reached my goal of half a million wasps.

382
00:28:12,557 --> 00:28:14,388
And Bruce is our youngest.

383
00:28:14,492 --> 00:28:17,723
Bruce found the gall
that hatched the millionth wasp.

384
00:28:17,829 --> 00:28:20,354
<i>It was in the mountains</i>
<i>outside Mexico City.</i>

385
00:28:20,465 --> 00:28:22,592
They grow up so fast.

386
00:28:22,701 --> 00:28:26,159
<i> Wejust didn't know</i>
<i>who to talk to, Professor Kinsey.</i>

387
00:28:26,271 --> 00:28:28,171
<i>What about your parents?</i>

388
00:28:28,273 --> 00:28:30,173
<i>I'd rather die.</i>

389
00:28:30,275 --> 00:28:33,176
<i> We heard you had good advice</i>
<i>for some of the biology students.</i>

390
00:28:33,278 --> 00:28:36,941
<i>Sexual difficulty among newly married people</i>
<i>is more common than you think.</i>

391
00:28:37,048 --> 00:28:39,073
<i>It's nothing to be ashamed of.</i>

392
00:28:39,184 --> 00:28:42,312
- How long have you been married?
- Two months now.

393
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:45,480
And, Emily, you've had absolutely
no response during that time?

394
00:28:45,590 --> 00:28:48,115
It's like I'm dead down there.

395
00:28:48,226 --> 00:28:52,060
We went to the doctor,
and he said there's nothing wrong.

396
00:28:52,163 --> 00:28:55,257
Does Ben ever use his fingers
to excite you?

397
00:28:55,366 --> 00:28:57,596
<i>Um...</i>

398
00:28:57,702 --> 00:28:59,727
why bother...

399
00:28:59,838 --> 00:29:03,137
now that we can do the real thing?

400
00:29:04,342 --> 00:29:06,776
What's your most common
sexual position?

401
00:29:08,012 --> 00:29:09,912
There's more than one?

402
00:29:10,014 --> 00:29:12,676
Mac and I are still discovering some.

403
00:29:14,786 --> 00:29:17,687
<i>Emily, were you sexually experienced</i>
<i>before you got married?</i>

404
00:29:17,789 --> 00:29:19,689
No.

405
00:29:19,791 --> 00:29:23,283
I still thought babies
came out of women's navels.

406
00:29:25,864 --> 00:29:27,991
Did you ever masturbate?

407
00:29:29,033 --> 00:29:31,001
It's all my fault.

408
00:29:32,203 --> 00:29:34,364
<i>I'm damaged in some way.</i>

409
00:29:34,472 --> 00:29:37,032
I'm frigid.

410
00:29:37,142 --> 00:29:39,633
I don't think that's the problem at all.

411
00:29:39,744 --> 00:29:42,713
Ben, do you ever perform
oral sex on Emily?

412
00:29:44,783 --> 00:29:47,775
Uh, I... I don't know
what that means, sir.

413
00:29:47,886 --> 00:29:50,446
Genital kissing.

414
00:29:57,595 --> 00:30:01,691
My brother told me
that that causes problems...

415
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:03,791
later on...

416
00:30:03,902 --> 00:30:05,893
with having babies.

417
00:30:06,004 --> 00:30:08,029
Oh, I don't think that's true.

418
00:30:08,139 --> 00:30:10,164
<i>No, I heard that too.</i>

419
00:30:10,275 --> 00:30:14,234
I can assure you, there's no relation
between oral sex and pregnancy.

420
00:30:14,345 --> 00:30:16,142
But how do you know?

421
00:30:16,247 --> 00:30:20,479
How do I know the Earth is round?
It just is.

422
00:30:21,653 --> 00:30:24,349
But... has anyone actually proven...

423
00:30:24,455 --> 00:30:26,355
that there's no connection?

424
00:30:26,457 --> 00:30:29,358
If you're asking whether
there's been a scientific study...

425
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:32,725
devoted to the subject
of oral copulation and fertility...

426
00:30:32,831 --> 00:30:35,265
well...

427
00:30:35,366 --> 00:30:38,267
frankly, I don't know.

428
00:30:39,971 --> 00:30:41,495
Well...

429
00:30:41,606 --> 00:30:43,574
then how can you be sure?

430
00:30:45,543 --> 00:30:48,444
I felt like a blundering amateur.

431
00:30:48,546 --> 00:30:51,447
I couldn't imagine where
those kids' crazy idea came from...

432
00:30:51,549 --> 00:30:53,449
until I discovered this...

433
00:30:53,551 --> 00:30:55,951
<i>Ideal Marriage:</i>
<i>Its Physiology and Technique.</i>

434
00:30:56,054 --> 00:30:57,954
Oh, dear.

435
00:30:58,056 --> 00:31:00,957
"Oral contact, while acceptable
as a means of stimulation...

436
00:31:01,059 --> 00:31:04,222
is pathological if carried through
to orgasm and possibly injurious."

437
00:31:04,329 --> 00:31:06,229
I must be in grave danger then.

438
00:31:06,331 --> 00:31:11,735
Wait. "The hand should never be used
for the purpose of sexual excitation.

439
00:31:11,836 --> 00:31:15,567
"There is but one finger of love with
which to approach the female genitals...

440
00:31:15,673 --> 00:31:17,834
and that is the male organ."

441
00:31:20,879 --> 00:31:23,780
It's all just hooey.
Morality disguised as fact.

442
00:31:23,882 --> 00:31:27,215
- Just do your tie.
- Hmm? Oh.

443
00:31:27,318 --> 00:31:29,377
Professor Kinsey's methods...

444
00:31:29,487 --> 00:31:32,115
of collecting vast numbers
of gall wasps...

445
00:31:32,223 --> 00:31:34,919
over a wide geographic range...

446
00:31:35,026 --> 00:31:37,290
have made him a starred scientist.

447
00:31:37,395 --> 00:31:41,092
<i>They have also earned him</i>
<i>his immortal nickname...</i>

448
00:31:41,199 --> 00:31:43,224
"Get-A-Million" Kinsey.

449
00:31:43,334 --> 00:31:45,666
"Bore-A-Million" Kinsey.

450
00:31:47,405 --> 00:31:51,171
His new book,
<i>The Origin of Higher Categories in...</i>

451
00:31:51,276 --> 00:31:53,176
"Sinnips"? "Cynips"?

452
00:31:53,278 --> 00:31:55,178
Close enough.

453
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:58,181
<i>Traces the origin of the gall wasp</i>
<i>back to its birthplace...</i>

454
00:31:58,283 --> 00:31:59,978
<i>in the Upper Cretaceous.</i>

455
00:32:00,084 --> 00:32:02,211
<i>So, now I give you...</i>

456
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:04,288
Dr. Kinsey.

457
00:32:09,794 --> 00:32:14,197
Thank you, President Wells, for that
incisive description of 20 years of work.

458
00:32:14,299 --> 00:32:17,291
I thought you
might actually have read my book...

459
00:32:17,402 --> 00:32:19,302
until I saw those crib notes
in your palm.

460
00:32:19,404 --> 00:32:22,498
Crib notes!

461
00:32:22,607 --> 00:32:24,700
<i>Of course,</i>
<i>my other book on cynips...</i>

462
00:32:24,809 --> 00:32:27,710
<i>hasn't been checked out</i>
<i>of the library in six years.</i>

463
00:32:27,812 --> 00:32:30,872
I'd be surprised
if a dozen people have read it.

464
00:32:30,982 --> 00:32:35,419
But I guess I always knew
that gall wasps weren't going to...

465
00:32:36,554 --> 00:32:39,523
make them beat a path to my door.

466
00:32:45,029 --> 00:32:47,088
In any case, thank you, Herman.

467
00:32:47,198 --> 00:32:50,929
This is... This is splendid.
A really fine event indeed.

468
00:32:52,036 --> 00:32:54,334
- Thank you.
<i>- Cheers, Prok.</i>

469
00:32:54,439 --> 00:32:56,566
<i>- Congratulations.</i>
<i>- Hear.! Hear.!</i>

470
00:32:56,674 --> 00:32:58,574
<i>Cheers.</i>

471
00:32:58,676 --> 00:33:00,576
<i>Some reform-minded undergraduates...</i>

472
00:33:00,678 --> 00:33:02,509
<i>paid me a visit the other day,</i>
<i>Thurman.</i>

473
00:33:02,613 --> 00:33:05,207
They are campaigning for a sex course.

474
00:33:05,316 --> 00:33:07,477
I already cover sex in the hygiene class.

475
00:33:07,585 --> 00:33:10,486
<i>Which the student paper called</i>
<i>the most useless course on campus.</i>

476
00:33:10,588 --> 00:33:14,490
<i>Oh, Kinsey. I'm glad to see middle age</i>
<i>hasn't softened the edges.</i>

477
00:33:14,592 --> 00:33:17,925
- Mrs. Kinsey.
- Not only is your class irrelevant, it's irresponsible.

478
00:33:18,029 --> 00:33:20,862
There's a V.D. Epidemic
sweeping this country, Thurman.

479
00:33:20,965 --> 00:33:24,560
And that's <i>my</i> fault? I don't know
whether to be insulted or flattered.

480
00:33:24,669 --> 00:33:27,194
<i>Besides, there's a cure for syphilis...</i>

481
00:33:27,305 --> 00:33:29,170
and it's called abstinence.

482
00:33:29,273 --> 00:33:30,672
Penicillin works just as well.

483
00:33:30,775 --> 00:33:34,575
Herman, the trustees appointed you
to shake things up around here.

484
00:33:34,679 --> 00:33:37,580
Why not address the need
for sex instruction that deals frankly...

485
00:33:37,682 --> 00:33:40,082
with students' real questions,
real concerns?

486
00:33:40,184 --> 00:33:43,585
<i>Open sex instruction</i>
<i>promotes daydreaming.</i>

487
00:33:43,688 --> 00:33:47,556
It is better to address these matters
in a general medical course.

488
00:33:47,658 --> 00:33:49,558
<i>You mean an anti-sex course...</i>

489
00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:52,094
with irrelevant gabble
about dahlias and bees.

490
00:33:52,196 --> 00:33:54,562
Gentlemen. Please.

491
00:33:54,665 --> 00:33:56,599
<i>I am going to take the students'proposal</i>
<i>under advisement.</i>

492
00:33:56,701 --> 00:33:58,293
Good.

493
00:33:58,403 --> 00:34:00,303
But since I just got this job...

494
00:34:00,405 --> 00:34:03,238
and wouldn't mind hanging on to it
for a couple of weeks...

495
00:34:03,341 --> 00:34:06,742
I think I'm gonna stick with
the hygiene course for now.

496
00:34:06,844 --> 00:34:09,244
<i>Medical authorities state...</i>

497
00:34:09,347 --> 00:34:13,647
<i>that, of the type of teenage giris applying</i>
<i>at public health stations for aid...</i>

498
00:34:13,751 --> 00:34:16,948
the percentage that is infected
with venereal disease...

499
00:34:17,055 --> 00:34:19,080
is always very high.

500
00:34:19,190 --> 00:34:21,454
In all of these cases...

501
00:34:21,559 --> 00:34:24,790
where youthful energy
and inquisitiveness are unrestrained...

502
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:28,093
The sex urge is always present...

503
00:34:28,199 --> 00:34:30,759
and promiscuity nearly always follows...

504
00:34:30,868 --> 00:34:32,597
<i>- With its inevitable harvest...</i>

505
00:34:32,703 --> 00:34:36,298
<i>of abortions, illegitimate births and...</i>

506
00:34:36,407 --> 00:34:38,068
disease.

507
00:34:38,176 --> 00:34:42,442
- What's your trouble, Jerry?
- Well, I... I've got a pretty bad sore down here.

508
00:34:42,547 --> 00:34:45,744
Just stretch out on that table over there.
We'll have a look at you.

509
00:34:45,850 --> 00:34:47,841
The story vividly portrays...

510
00:34:47,952 --> 00:34:50,978
the misery caused to innocent victims...

511
00:34:51,089 --> 00:34:52,989
<i>- By the ignorance or selfishness...</i>

512
00:34:53,091 --> 00:34:56,026
<i>of individuals infected with syphilis.</i>

513
00:34:56,127 --> 00:34:58,027
<i>You had to learn the hard way...</i>

514
00:34:58,129 --> 00:35:00,620
<i>that you can't tell by the looks of a woman</i>
<i>whether she has syphilis or not.</i>

515
00:35:00,731 --> 00:35:02,562
I guess that finishes me.

516
00:35:02,667 --> 00:35:05,830
I'll have to quit school and go someplace
where people don't know who I am.

517
00:35:05,937 --> 00:35:08,997
<i>The cure forjuvenile delinquency is...</i>

518
00:35:09,107 --> 00:35:11,735
an education in the dangers
and consequences...

519
00:35:11,843 --> 00:35:14,209
of breaking the time-tested rules...

520
00:35:14,312 --> 00:35:17,873
laid down for the regulation
of human conduct.

521
00:35:20,785 --> 00:35:23,686
The idea that men need sex...

522
00:35:23,788 --> 00:35:25,756
is a lie.

523
00:35:26,958 --> 00:35:28,858
If it were true...

524
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:32,123
the boy who exercises
his sex organs regularly...

525
00:35:32,230 --> 00:35:36,860
<i>would achieve the greatest</i>
<i>sexual experiences in later life.</i>

526
00:35:36,968 --> 00:35:41,871
Whereas, in fact, that boy
is likely to be sexually dead...

527
00:35:41,973 --> 00:35:44,373
<i>by the time he reaches adulthood.</i>

528
00:35:45,676 --> 00:35:47,906
Abstinence poses no difficulty...

529
00:35:48,012 --> 00:35:50,742
for the college-age male.

530
00:35:50,848 --> 00:35:54,249
Men don't reach their sexual peak
until the age of 40.

531
00:35:55,286 --> 00:35:57,083
It is the lower-class male...

532
00:35:57,188 --> 00:35:59,088
often Negro...

533
00:35:59,190 --> 00:36:03,251
<i>who finds it difficult</i>
<i>to control his urges.</i>

534
00:36:03,361 --> 00:36:06,694
<i>However, perfect inhibition...</i>

535
00:36:06,797 --> 00:36:09,197
although an ideal to be striven for...

536
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:11,200
is not always achievable.

537
00:36:11,302 --> 00:36:14,533
Stress and the worries of the day...

538
00:36:14,639 --> 00:36:17,540
can lead to a weakening of resolve...

539
00:36:17,642 --> 00:36:20,440
opening the door to temptation.

540
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:25,314
When tense at bedtime...

541
00:36:26,551 --> 00:36:30,112
I find there are
little tricks to relaxing.

542
00:36:30,221 --> 00:36:32,121
If I can't get to sleep...

543
00:36:32,223 --> 00:36:34,521
I like to close my eyes...

544
00:36:34,625 --> 00:36:37,526
and think of all theJohns I know.

545
00:36:37,628 --> 00:36:39,892
Oh.

546
00:36:41,132 --> 00:36:44,033
Well, not onlyJohns.

547
00:36:44,135 --> 00:36:46,035
Sometimes Peters.

548
00:36:46,137 --> 00:36:48,697
How about Dicks?

549
00:36:48,806 --> 00:36:51,468
I'm sorry?

550
00:36:53,244 --> 00:36:54,693
<i>If you're here to enroll</i>
<i>in Dr. Kinsey's class...</i>

551
00:36:54,728 --> 00:36:56,142
<i>If you're here to enroll</i>
<i>in Dr. Kinsey's class...</i>

552
00:36:56,247 --> 00:36:59,512
it's only open to faculty members
and their wives, graduate students...

553
00:36:59,617 --> 00:37:01,517
<i>seniors and married undergraduates.</i>

554
00:37:03,554 --> 00:37:05,954
Come back and try in the spring.

555
00:37:06,057 --> 00:37:07,957
Are you a senior?

556
00:37:08,059 --> 00:37:10,027
Um, we're engaged.

557
00:37:11,696 --> 00:37:13,664
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

558
00:37:18,502 --> 00:37:21,903
Why offer a marriage course?

559
00:37:22,006 --> 00:37:23,906
Because society has interfered...

560
00:37:24,008 --> 00:37:27,205
with what should be
a normal biological development...

561
00:37:27,311 --> 00:37:30,644
causing a scandalous delay
of sexual activity...

562
00:37:30,748 --> 00:37:33,649
<i>which leads to sexual difficulty</i>
<i>in early marriage.</i>

563
00:37:33,751 --> 00:37:37,653
<i>In an uninhibited society, a 12-year-old</i>
<i>would know most of the biology...</i>

564
00:37:37,755 --> 00:37:40,815
which I will have to give you
in formal lectures.

565
00:37:40,925 --> 00:37:45,919
<i>So, let's start with the six stages</i>
<i>of the coital sequence.</i>

566
00:37:46,030 --> 00:37:48,294
Stimulation...

567
00:37:48,399 --> 00:37:50,924
lubrication, erection...

568
00:37:52,770 --> 00:37:55,000
increased sensitivity...

569
00:37:55,106 --> 00:37:58,132
orgasm and nervous release.

570
00:37:58,242 --> 00:38:02,679
Both sexes experience
all six stages equally.

571
00:38:07,551 --> 00:38:12,045
Stimulation.

572
00:38:13,324 --> 00:38:16,122
Who can tell me
which part of the human body...

573
00:38:16,227 --> 00:38:18,195
can enlarge a hundred times?

574
00:38:19,230 --> 00:38:22,961
Um... miss.

575
00:38:24,902 --> 00:38:27,029
I'm sure I don't know.

576
00:38:27,138 --> 00:38:31,040
<i>And you've no right to ask me</i>
<i>such a question in a mixed class.</i>

577
00:38:31,142 --> 00:38:34,373
I was referring to the pupil
of your eye, young lady.

578
00:38:37,081 --> 00:38:40,482
And I think I should tell you you're in
for a terrible disappointment.

579
00:38:42,153 --> 00:38:46,249
<i>It is often with the eye</i>
<i>that stimulation begins.</i>

580
00:38:53,798 --> 00:38:57,063
<i>The actual adjustments which are made</i>
<i>in the male and female genitalia...</i>

581
00:38:57,168 --> 00:38:59,136
are shown on this slide.

582
00:39:00,271 --> 00:39:02,102
<i>The vagina must be spread open...</i>

583
00:39:02,206 --> 00:39:05,039
<i>as the erect male organ penetrates.</i>

584
00:39:06,310 --> 00:39:09,177
You will see
that the clitoris is swollen...

585
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:13,114
<i>thus providing</i>
<i>the erotic stimulation necessary...</i>

586
00:39:13,217 --> 00:39:15,947
for the completion of the act
on the part of the female.

587
00:39:19,056 --> 00:39:21,752
<i>You will also see</i>
<i>that this point on the penis...</i>

588
00:39:21,859 --> 00:39:25,454
which is one of the most sensitive points,
is similarly stimulated.

589
00:39:30,167 --> 00:39:32,067
Ohh!

590
00:39:32,169 --> 00:39:34,399
Where on earth did you get that cap?

591
00:39:34,505 --> 00:39:36,735
Oh. Professor Kinsey. I'm sorry.

592
00:39:36,841 --> 00:39:38,741
It's a whaler's hat.

593
00:39:38,843 --> 00:39:41,744
Not very pretty,
but extremely practical in a storm.

594
00:39:41,846 --> 00:39:44,610
- Do I know you?
- I'm in your marriage course. Clyde Martin.

595
00:39:44,715 --> 00:39:47,411
How are you finding it, Mr. Martin?

596
00:39:47,518 --> 00:39:51,113
Oh, it's the most enlightening class
I've ever taken.

597
00:39:51,222 --> 00:39:54,248
Well, I'd better get going. I've got
a job interview at the zoology department.

598
00:39:54,358 --> 00:39:57,156
Forget that. Come with me.

599
00:39:57,261 --> 00:39:59,229
All right.

600
00:40:02,266 --> 00:40:05,827
<i>Don't worry. Dr. Kinsey will be staying late.</i>
<i>He'll get to all of you.</i>

601
00:40:05,936 --> 00:40:07,665
Can too much sex cause cancer?

602
00:40:07,772 --> 00:40:09,637
Will wearing high heels
make me sterile?

603
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:11,731
I think my vagina's abnormally shaped.

604
00:40:11,842 --> 00:40:13,139
Can you get syphilis from a whistle?

605
00:40:13,244 --> 00:40:16,304
Is homosexuality a form of insanity?

606
00:40:16,414 --> 00:40:18,382
I think about my cat.

607
00:40:19,417 --> 00:40:21,248
A lot!

608
00:40:21,352 --> 00:40:25,413
Does su-s-s-suppressing sex...

609
00:40:25,523 --> 00:40:27,423
lead to stuttering?

610
00:40:27,525 --> 00:40:29,857
<i>Is my penis smaller than most?</i>

611
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:34,329
Does too much masturbation
cause premature ejaculation?

612
00:40:34,432 --> 00:40:38,198
Is it unusual for my boyfriend
to touch my anus?

613
00:40:38,302 --> 00:40:41,135
All excellent questions.

614
00:40:41,238 --> 00:40:43,138
They all have the same answer...

615
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:46,937
I don't know.

616
00:40:47,044 --> 00:40:50,275
From a sexual standpoint,
it's hard to say what's common or rare...

617
00:40:50,381 --> 00:40:53,544
because we know so little
about what people actually do.

618
00:40:53,651 --> 00:40:58,111
<i>This leaves most of us</i>
<i>feeling anxious or guilty.</i>

619
00:40:58,222 --> 00:41:00,622
Am I interested in the right things?

620
00:41:00,724 --> 00:41:03,887
Do I do things the normal way?

621
00:41:03,994 --> 00:41:06,895
One of the ways of finding out
what people do...

622
00:41:06,997 --> 00:41:09,397
is to find out what they've done.

623
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:13,664
So please, take the time to fill out
these sex questionnaires.

624
00:41:13,771 --> 00:41:17,298
Try to be as accurate and honest
as you possibly can.

625
00:41:17,408 --> 00:41:20,309
This will only work...
Pass them along, please.

626
00:41:20,411 --> 00:41:22,902
<i>This will only work</i>
<i>if you tell the truth.</i>

627
00:41:23,013 --> 00:41:26,414
<i>Dr. Kinsey, this is really... amazing.</i>

628
00:41:26,517 --> 00:41:28,917
These colors are incredible.

629
00:41:29,019 --> 00:41:32,921
It's the most complete collection
east of the Mississippi.

630
00:41:33,023 --> 00:41:36,015
We have over 250
separate varieties of irises.

631
00:41:38,128 --> 00:41:42,428
Good work, Martin, but you're using
the wrong muscle group.

632
00:41:44,335 --> 00:41:48,203
<i>Come on. Here.</i>
<i>Bend the legs. Use the thighs.</i>

633
00:41:48,305 --> 00:41:50,535
- Okay.
- The arms should only be used to guide.

634
00:41:50,641 --> 00:41:53,007
<i>No, you do it. Guide.</i>

635
00:41:53,110 --> 00:41:55,078
Ah!

636
00:41:56,447 --> 00:41:58,711
Lemonade.

637
00:41:58,816 --> 00:42:01,250
<i>Mac, these responses will floor you.</i>

638
00:42:01,352 --> 00:42:04,014
The gap between what we assume
people do and what they actually do...

639
00:42:04,121 --> 00:42:05,782
is enormous.

640
00:42:05,890 --> 00:42:08,120
<i>You know what amazes me?</i>

641
00:42:08,225 --> 00:42:11,194
There's no relation between
how sexy a girl looks and her sex life.

642
00:42:11,295 --> 00:42:13,195
The ugly ones
seem to get all the action.

643
00:42:13,297 --> 00:42:16,789
I always thought "ugly"
was an ugly word.

644
00:42:16,901 --> 00:42:18,391
Sorry.

645
00:42:20,371 --> 00:42:22,362
<i>Not only does every male in the class</i>
<i>have a history of masturbation.</i>

646
00:42:22,473 --> 00:42:24,566
Most of the women do too.

647
00:42:24,675 --> 00:42:28,133
That doesn't surprise me.
What about premarital sex?

648
00:42:28,245 --> 00:42:31,373
<i>About a third of the married men</i>
<i>claim at least one experience.</i>

649
00:42:31,482 --> 00:42:34,747
- It's only one in 10 for the women.
- If they're telling the truth.

650
00:42:34,852 --> 00:42:37,582
<i>And there's extramarital sex too.</i>

651
00:42:37,688 --> 00:42:40,418
Not just heterosexual,
but homosexual.

652
00:42:40,524 --> 00:42:43,220
<i>I just wish we could get</i>
<i>more volunteers.</i>

653
00:42:43,327 --> 00:42:45,591
A hundred cases
is hardly representative.

654
00:42:45,696 --> 00:42:47,596
<i>Maybe it's because it's a questionnaire.</i>

655
00:42:47,698 --> 00:42:49,825
Feels too much like homework or a test.

656
00:42:49,934 --> 00:42:53,563
I agree. Also, people don't know
if they can trust you.

657
00:42:53,671 --> 00:42:56,799
<i>- They have to be sure their secrets are safe.</i>
- But that's ridiculous.

658
00:42:56,907 --> 00:42:59,808
Everyone knows I keep those questionnaires
under lock and key.

659
00:42:59,910 --> 00:43:02,242
Clyde has a point.

660
00:43:02,346 --> 00:43:05,247
You're asking people to reveal
information that's very sensitive...

661
00:43:05,349 --> 00:43:07,317
possibly even damaging.

662
00:43:09,219 --> 00:43:11,619
What if you just talked to them?

663
00:43:11,722 --> 00:43:14,691
<i>Then all their secrets</i>
<i>would be in your head.</i>

664
00:43:19,229 --> 00:43:22,323
Martin, you should have
spoken up months ago.

665
00:43:24,768 --> 00:43:27,100
I can't tell.
Was that a compliment?

666
00:43:27,204 --> 00:43:29,172
Yes, I think it was.

667
00:43:30,207 --> 00:43:32,107
People resist at first.

668
00:43:32,209 --> 00:43:34,109
But I'm trying to choreograph
the questions...

669
00:43:34,211 --> 00:43:36,111
so they'll be disarmed into answering.

670
00:43:36,213 --> 00:43:39,614
- How many different things
have you put in there, Daddy?
- It's the Kinsey stew, sweetie.

671
00:43:39,717 --> 00:43:41,617
"Clean out the refrigerator" night,
you mean.

672
00:43:41,719 --> 00:43:43,619
Martin's been surprisingly helpful.

673
00:43:43,721 --> 00:43:47,623
He's an ideal practice subject, since he's
had relations with both men and women.

674
00:43:47,725 --> 00:43:49,625
- Where have you been?
- Swim practice.

675
00:43:49,727 --> 00:43:51,627
- How'd it go?
- Pretty good.

676
00:43:51,729 --> 00:43:55,130
- Coach said he might start me at the next meet.
- Bruce, that's wonderful.

677
00:43:55,232 --> 00:43:58,633
I told you there won't be any more swimming
unless your science grades improve.

678
00:43:58,736 --> 00:44:00,636
I can't help it, Dad. I hate biology.

679
00:44:00,738 --> 00:44:03,070
That's because you have never
developed your intellect.

680
00:44:03,173 --> 00:44:05,073
Physical activity is important, Son...

681
00:44:05,175 --> 00:44:07,075
but your interest in sports
is excessive.

682
00:44:07,177 --> 00:44:10,442
Yes. Maybe he should
take up engineering instead.

683
00:44:11,749 --> 00:44:15,014
The one-on-one
is turning out to be so elastic.

684
00:44:15,119 --> 00:44:18,020
Talking to people yields more information
than I ever imagined.

685
00:44:18,122 --> 00:44:21,023
I think it will prove to be
a groundbreaking technique.

686
00:44:21,125 --> 00:44:23,593
What if they make things up?
That's what I'd do.

687
00:44:23,694 --> 00:44:27,391
<i>I'm building in little trip wires</i>
<i>to catch lies and inconsistencies.</i>

688
00:44:27,498 --> 00:44:31,525
- Would you like to take <i>my</i> sex history, Daddy?
- Do you have a sex history?

689
00:44:31,635 --> 00:44:33,159
No.

690
00:44:33,270 --> 00:44:36,398
<i>What about you, Anne?</i>
<i>You've been dating Jim for a while now.</i>

691
00:44:36,507 --> 00:44:38,407
We've done some petting.

692
00:44:38,509 --> 00:44:41,171
I figured we wouldn't
try intercourse until college.

693
00:44:41,278 --> 00:44:43,678
That's probably better.

694
00:44:43,781 --> 00:44:46,215
<i>If Anne can have intercourse,</i>
<i>I should be able to too.</i>

695
00:44:46,316 --> 00:44:49,012
Your sister's 18
and seriously involved with someone.

696
00:44:49,119 --> 00:44:50,882
Does it hurt?

697
00:44:52,189 --> 00:44:54,680
- What, dear?
- Breaking the hymen.

698
00:44:56,560 --> 00:44:58,050
Oh...

699
00:44:59,663 --> 00:45:01,790
just a little...
it's nothing too bad.

700
00:45:01,899 --> 00:45:05,391
<i>It helps if you spread the vulva</i>
<i>to facilitate penetration.</i>

701
00:45:05,502 --> 00:45:09,302
Can we please talk
about something else for once?

702
00:45:09,406 --> 00:45:12,307
Other families don't do this.
It isn't normal.

703
00:45:12,409 --> 00:45:14,809
When did you become such a prig?

704
00:45:14,912 --> 00:45:18,404
My friends aren't even allowed to come over here.
Their parents think you're a menace!

705
00:45:18,515 --> 00:45:22,110
You spend too much time in the water.
All that chlorine's done something to your brain!

706
00:45:22,219 --> 00:45:24,915
- Have you learned nothing?
- Sometimes I don't know where he came from.

707
00:45:25,022 --> 00:45:27,490
Nothing!

708
00:45:28,692 --> 00:45:30,592
Bruce? Bruce.

709
00:45:30,694 --> 00:45:33,424
I don't wanna talk about it.
He won't get off my back.

710
00:45:37,334 --> 00:45:40,565
<i> I heard about this community</i>
<i>from a former student of mine.</i>

711
00:45:40,671 --> 00:45:44,072
<i>This is my third trip, and already</i>
<i>the results have been astounding.</i>

712
00:45:44,174 --> 00:45:47,575
By my calculation, there are over
300,000 cases here in Chicago...

713
00:45:47,678 --> 00:45:50,579
and no one's ever even bothered
to talk to them before.

714
00:45:50,681 --> 00:45:54,481
It's a gold mine of information, Martin,
and we've got it all to ourselves.

715
00:46:03,927 --> 00:46:05,827
What'll it be, handsome?

716
00:46:05,929 --> 00:46:07,897
Two scotches.

717
00:46:09,399 --> 00:46:12,300
I find liquor is an essential tool
for social lubrication...

718
00:46:12,402 --> 00:46:16,361
although it has involved more drinking
than I thought I would ever do in a lifetime.

719
00:46:18,976 --> 00:46:20,944
Let's get started.

720
00:46:22,980 --> 00:46:26,347
Hello, I'm Professor Kinsey
from Indiana University...

721
00:46:26,450 --> 00:46:29,351
and I'm making a study
of sex behavior.

722
00:46:29,453 --> 00:46:32,047
- Can we sit and talk?
- I assume you're joking.

723
00:46:32,156 --> 00:46:34,056
No, I'm not.

724
00:46:34,158 --> 00:46:38,219
I'd be grateful if you'd answer
some questions about your sexual history.

725
00:46:38,328 --> 00:46:40,228
Mary here is a professor.

726
00:46:40,330 --> 00:46:43,231
She says she wants to study
my sex behavior.

727
00:46:43,333 --> 00:46:46,825
Well, tell her to stick around and watch.

728
00:46:46,937 --> 00:46:50,896
- Andy's here. You have to see what he's wearing.
- I can't wait.

729
00:46:52,176 --> 00:46:53,837
That Andy.

730
00:46:53,944 --> 00:46:56,674
Hello. I'm Professor Kinsey from...

731
00:46:56,780 --> 00:46:59,180
Excuse me. I'm Professor Kinsey.

732
00:46:59,283 --> 00:47:01,376
Excuse me... Hello.

733
00:47:01,485 --> 00:47:03,749
<i>I'm Professor Kinsey</i>
<i>from Indiana University...</i>

734
00:47:03,854 --> 00:47:05,822
and I'm making a study
of sex behavior.

735
00:47:05,923 --> 00:47:08,983
- Can I ask you a few questions?
- I've heard about you.

736
00:47:09,092 --> 00:47:11,993
- You're the sex doctor, right?
- I guess I am.

737
00:47:12,095 --> 00:47:15,587
If you'd be kind enough to talk to me,
it would be of great help to science.

738
00:47:16,700 --> 00:47:19,168
Sure. What do you want to know?

739
00:47:19,269 --> 00:47:22,670
<i>Same boy. Tommy Potts.</i>

740
00:47:22,773 --> 00:47:25,674
<i>We were messin'around</i>
<i>in a haystack...</i>

741
00:47:25,776 --> 00:47:28,108
<i>you know, the way kids'll do.</i>

742
00:47:30,280 --> 00:47:32,248
Pop walked in...

743
00:47:34,218 --> 00:47:36,516
found us, locked us in the barn.

744
00:47:37,554 --> 00:47:40,352
Called my brothers in.

745
00:47:41,458 --> 00:47:43,426
They, um...

746
00:47:45,028 --> 00:47:46,996
They branded us.

747
00:47:55,539 --> 00:47:57,507
Took turns doin' it.

748
00:47:59,343 --> 00:48:01,573
Then they beat us raw.

749
00:48:01,678 --> 00:48:04,704
Broke a couple ribs, collarbone.

750
00:48:05,749 --> 00:48:07,717
Tommy, he, uh...

751
00:48:09,419 --> 00:48:12,388
he didn't make out as well as I did.

752
00:48:15,058 --> 00:48:18,585
- What age were you?
- Thirteen.

753
00:48:18,695 --> 00:48:22,722
- And you've been on your own since then?
- I get by.

754
00:48:26,470 --> 00:48:29,371
It's not that I mind being queer.

755
00:48:29,473 --> 00:48:31,703
'Cause I don't.

756
00:48:31,808 --> 00:48:34,276
It's just, um...

757
00:48:34,378 --> 00:48:37,279
I wish other folks
weren't so put out by it.

758
00:48:37,381 --> 00:48:40,282
Homosexuality happens to be...

759
00:48:40,384 --> 00:48:42,614
out of fashion in society now.

760
00:48:42,719 --> 00:48:45,017
That doesn't mean
it won't change someday.

761
00:48:45,122 --> 00:48:47,090
Right.

762
00:48:55,599 --> 00:48:58,500
<i>But why didn't I see it before?</i>

763
00:48:58,602 --> 00:49:02,038
Human beings are just bigger,
slightly more complicated gall wasps.

764
00:49:02,139 --> 00:49:04,539
All I have to do is collect
more than anyone else...

765
00:49:04,641 --> 00:49:07,542
and homosexuals
are the perfect place to start.

766
00:49:07,644 --> 00:49:09,737
What?

767
00:49:09,846 --> 00:49:12,747
I'm sorry. I just had an image of some
of our friends hearing you right now.

768
00:49:12,849 --> 00:49:15,181
As if the marriage course
isn't bad enough.

769
00:49:15,285 --> 00:49:20,951
Now, Prok, promise me you'll get at least
four hours sleep before heading back.

770
00:49:21,058 --> 00:49:22,787
<i>Of course.</i>

771
00:49:22,893 --> 00:49:24,827
And let Clyde share in the driving.

772
00:49:26,830 --> 00:49:28,730
Prok?

773
00:49:28,832 --> 00:49:30,732
Okay, Mac.

774
00:49:30,834 --> 00:49:32,734
I'll sign off now.

775
00:49:32,836 --> 00:49:35,396
I love you.

776
00:49:35,505 --> 00:49:37,473
Love you too.

777
00:49:48,285 --> 00:49:51,015
<i>You know what</i>
<i>impressed me tonight?</i>

778
00:49:51,121 --> 00:49:53,021
Mmm?

779
00:49:53,123 --> 00:49:57,492
The way that you talk to people.
You can get just about anybody to open up.

780
00:49:57,594 --> 00:50:00,688
Oh, well, it's just a matter of, uh...

781
00:50:00,797 --> 00:50:02,697
putting yourself on their level.

782
00:50:02,799 --> 00:50:05,029
<i>No, it's more than that.</i>

783
00:50:05,135 --> 00:50:07,103
You really seem to care.

784
00:50:18,782 --> 00:50:21,148
- This rating scale of yours?
- Mm-hmm?

785
00:50:21,251 --> 00:50:24,152
Uh, zero to six...

786
00:50:24,254 --> 00:50:26,882
Zero being exclusively heterosexual...

787
00:50:26,990 --> 00:50:32,223
and, uh, six being
exclusively homosexual.

788
00:50:32,329 --> 00:50:35,093
A great many people line up
somewhere in the middle.

789
00:50:35,198 --> 00:50:38,065
- What makes you think that's true?
- Common sense.

790
00:50:38,168 --> 00:50:41,467
Remember, about a third
of our heterosexual histories...

791
00:50:41,571 --> 00:50:43,630
have homosexual acts,
and vice versa.

792
00:50:43,740 --> 00:50:46,470
Right.

793
00:50:46,576 --> 00:50:48,976
I guess I'm about a three, huh?

794
00:50:49,079 --> 00:50:51,980
Based on your sexual history...

795
00:50:52,082 --> 00:50:55,574
I'd say that's, um, right.

796
00:50:55,685 --> 00:50:57,880
How about you?

797
00:51:00,690 --> 00:51:03,716
I suppose I've been a one or two...

798
00:51:04,928 --> 00:51:07,089
most of my life...

799
00:51:07,197 --> 00:51:09,256
even though it's taken a long time...

800
00:51:09,366 --> 00:51:12,233
to recognize it.

801
00:51:14,004 --> 00:51:16,063
And now?

802
00:51:20,744 --> 00:51:22,712
Probably...

803
00:51:25,182 --> 00:51:27,082
th-three.

804
00:51:27,184 --> 00:51:29,914
Have you ever
done anything about it?

805
00:51:34,591 --> 00:51:37,185
Would you like to?

806
00:52:09,593 --> 00:52:12,494
<i>I've taken on so many</i>
<i>other people's secrets.</i>

807
00:52:12,596 --> 00:52:14,564
<i>I don't want any of my own...</i>

808
00:52:14,664 --> 00:52:16,632
and certainly not with you.

809
00:52:18,268 --> 00:52:20,566
You still haven't said anything.

810
00:52:22,906 --> 00:52:25,534
It's not like I'm...

811
00:52:25,642 --> 00:52:28,202
surprised exactly.

812
00:52:28,311 --> 00:52:30,643
I've observed...

813
00:52:30,747 --> 00:52:32,647
certain things over the years.

814
00:52:32,749 --> 00:52:34,649
Such as?

815
00:52:34,751 --> 00:52:36,719
<i>A look or a gesture.</i>

816
00:52:38,822 --> 00:52:41,757
The pet student who suddenly
becomes a member of the family...

817
00:52:41,858 --> 00:52:44,656
<i>and then just as suddenly disappears</i>
<i>when you tire ofhim.</i>

818
00:52:44,761 --> 00:52:47,662
I think you must know me
better than I know myself.

819
00:52:47,764 --> 00:52:50,392
But I'm not sure...

820
00:52:50,500 --> 00:52:52,559
I understand.

821
00:52:54,037 --> 00:52:56,938
Haven't I always been open
to whatever you wanted?

822
00:52:57,040 --> 00:53:01,272
It's not you, Mac.
You're the best partner any man could have.

823
00:53:01,378 --> 00:53:04,074
I'm just not enough. Is that it?

824
00:53:08,351 --> 00:53:10,182
<i>Please, Mac.</i>

825
00:53:10,287 --> 00:53:13,188
This is inside of me.
To what extent, I don't know.

826
00:53:13,290 --> 00:53:16,885
But I'd be a hypocrite
if I pretended it wasn't there.

827
00:53:16,993 --> 00:53:19,393
<i>- When I took your history...</i>
- Don't! Don't!

828
00:53:19,496 --> 00:53:22,397
- Didn't you admit to having
sexual feelings for other men?
- Don't use that against me!

829
00:53:22,499 --> 00:53:25,400
I'm sorry. But what keeps you from
acting on your feelings? Convention.

830
00:53:25,502 --> 00:53:29,598
No! It's our marriage!
It's our children!

831
00:53:29,706 --> 00:53:32,106
Exactly. Social restraints.

832
00:53:33,777 --> 00:53:36,678
Did you ever stop to think
that perhaps those restraints are there...

833
00:53:36,780 --> 00:53:38,748
to keep people
from hurting each other?

834
00:53:41,084 --> 00:53:44,315
I don't sleep with other men
because I love you...

835
00:53:44,421 --> 00:53:46,321
and I don't want to hurt you.

836
00:53:46,423 --> 00:53:48,414
But what if it didn't hurt me?

837
00:53:48,525 --> 00:53:50,891
Then I'd be hurt.

838
00:53:50,994 --> 00:53:54,896
You're just afraid that I won't love you
anymore, which is impossible, Mac.

839
00:53:54,998 --> 00:53:58,525
The human animal is capable
of all kinds of sexual expression.

840
00:53:58,635 --> 00:54:02,503
<i>Not all sex has to be sanctioned</i>
<i>by love, enriched by emotion.</i>

841
00:54:02,606 --> 00:54:04,506
<i>- To the Greeks...</i>
- Stop!

842
00:54:04,608 --> 00:54:06,769
<i>Stop lecturing, Prok.</i>

843
00:54:06,876 --> 00:54:09,845
Stop using science
to justify what you've done.

844
00:54:12,482 --> 00:54:14,450
Oh, Mac.

845
00:54:16,253 --> 00:54:18,244
Mac.

846
00:54:18,355 --> 00:54:20,255
Listen to me.

847
00:54:20,357 --> 00:54:23,724
You're my girl.
You always will be.

848
00:54:23,827 --> 00:54:26,489
The bond we have, the life we share...

849
00:54:26,596 --> 00:54:28,689
sex is nothing compared to that.

850
00:54:31,668 --> 00:54:34,603
I can't talk about this anymore.

851
00:54:56,526 --> 00:54:59,427
<i> Most people think</i>
<i>that what they do sexually...</i>

852
00:54:59,529 --> 00:55:01,429
<i>is what everyone does...</i>

853
00:55:01,531 --> 00:55:03,362
<i>or should do.</i>

854
00:55:03,466 --> 00:55:07,630
<i>But I might remark that nearly all</i>
<i>the so-called sexual perversions...</i>

855
00:55:07,737 --> 00:55:11,104
<i>fall within the range</i>
<i>ofbiologic normality.</i>

856
00:55:11,207 --> 00:55:14,040
<i>For example, masturbation...</i>

857
00:55:14,144 --> 00:55:17,375
<i>mouth-genital contacts</i>
<i>and homosexual acts...</i>

858
00:55:17,480 --> 00:55:19,675
<i>are common</i>
<i>among most mammals...</i>

859
00:55:19,783 --> 00:55:21,876
<i>including humans.</i>

860
00:55:21,985 --> 00:55:25,887
<i>Society might condemn such practices</i>
<i>on moral grounds.</i>

861
00:55:25,989 --> 00:55:29,447
<i>However, it's ludicrous</i>
<i>to call them unnatural.</i>

862
00:55:30,927 --> 00:55:32,827
<i>But based on</i>
<i>the first Book of Genesis...</i>

863
00:55:32,929 --> 00:55:35,022
<i>and according to public opinion...</i>

864
00:55:35,131 --> 00:55:38,430
<i>there's only one</i>
<i>correct sexual equation...</i>

865
00:55:38,535 --> 00:55:40,935
man plus woman equals baby.

866
00:55:41,037 --> 00:55:43,267
Everything else is vice.

867
00:55:43,373 --> 00:55:46,774
But the orgasm record of the males
in this classroom alone...

868
00:55:46,876 --> 00:55:49,777
proves the ineffectiveness
of social restrictions...

869
00:55:49,879 --> 00:55:53,246
and the imperativeness
of the biologic demand.

870
00:55:58,788 --> 00:56:00,688
Why are some cows highly sexed...

871
00:56:00,790 --> 00:56:02,690
while others just stand there?

872
00:56:04,961 --> 00:56:07,862
<i>Why do some men</i>
<i>need 30 orgasms a week...</i>

873
00:56:07,964 --> 00:56:10,091
<i>and others almost none?</i>

874
00:56:13,970 --> 00:56:16,598
Because everyone is different.

875
00:56:18,007 --> 00:56:21,204
<i>The problem is,</i>
<i>most people want to be the same.</i>

876
00:56:23,012 --> 00:56:25,412
<i>They find it easier to simply ignore...</i>

877
00:56:25,515 --> 00:56:28,541
<i>this fundamental aspect</i>
<i>of the human condition.</i>

878
00:56:30,320 --> 00:56:33,255
<i>They're so eager</i>
<i>to be part of the group...</i>

879
00:56:33,356 --> 00:56:36,883
that they'll betray their own nature
to get there.

880
00:56:38,561 --> 00:56:42,463
<i>If something pleasurable</i>
<i>and strongly desired is prohibited...</i>

881
00:56:42,565 --> 00:56:44,999
<i>it becomes an obsession.</i>

882
00:56:47,670 --> 00:56:49,638
Think about this.

883
00:57:04,921 --> 00:57:06,821
You have better things to do...

884
00:57:06,923 --> 00:57:09,824
than help a middle-aged woman home
with her groceries.

885
00:57:09,926 --> 00:57:12,827
Prok got worried
when he couldn't reach you.

886
00:57:12,929 --> 00:57:15,830
Said he had to take histories
later this evening...

887
00:57:15,932 --> 00:57:18,059
so he'd like an early dinner.

888
00:57:18,168 --> 00:57:20,068
- Hmph.
- Preferably 5:00.

889
00:57:20,170 --> 00:57:22,570
Hardly gives me time to boil an egg.

890
00:57:22,672 --> 00:57:24,572
- Can I help?
- No. I'll manage.

891
00:57:24,674 --> 00:57:27,575
I just... I'm sorry
he made you play messenger.

892
00:57:27,677 --> 00:57:29,804
No. I volunteered.

893
00:57:32,081 --> 00:57:33,981
Mmm.

894
00:57:37,187 --> 00:57:39,087
Hear that?

895
00:57:39,189 --> 00:57:41,783
- What?
- The sound of an empty nest.

896
00:57:45,328 --> 00:57:48,297
Must be a big adjustment.
Have you heard from Bruce yet?

897
00:57:48,398 --> 00:57:50,696
No. He's loving college.

898
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:52,995
Maybe it's just
being away from here.

899
00:57:53,102 --> 00:57:56,071
- Oh.
- Would you like a piece of pie?

900
00:57:56,172 --> 00:57:58,640
- Rhubarb?
- Have a seat.

901
00:58:04,414 --> 00:58:07,872
You know, Clyde,
I didn't like you very much at first.

902
00:58:09,018 --> 00:58:11,009
I don't blame you.

903
00:58:11,120 --> 00:58:14,920
- Most women would have had me murdered.
- Oh, I considered it.

904
00:58:15,024 --> 00:58:17,151
I hate to think of myself
as conventional.

905
00:58:18,361 --> 00:58:21,262
But if this had to happen...

906
00:58:23,032 --> 00:58:25,523
I'm glad it was you.

907
00:58:25,635 --> 00:58:29,401
And I... have to admit
there have been some benefits.

908
00:58:30,840 --> 00:58:34,332
It certainly sparked things up sexually.

909
00:58:34,444 --> 00:58:37,242
I suppose we'd both grown bored
without even realizing it.

910
00:58:39,115 --> 00:58:41,015
I think you've handled it
remarkably well.

911
00:58:42,185 --> 00:58:44,153
I learned something a long time ago.

912
00:58:44,254 --> 00:58:46,950
Once Prok has his mind set,
it's no use trying to stop him.

913
00:58:48,091 --> 00:58:50,184
Yes.

914
00:58:50,293 --> 00:58:52,261
<i>He is...</i>

915
00:58:53,396 --> 00:58:55,921
relentless.

916
00:58:58,234 --> 00:59:00,134
Clyde?

917
00:59:02,305 --> 00:59:06,469
You know, this thing
between Prok and me...

918
00:59:07,677 --> 00:59:10,145
<i>it was fine for a while, but...</i>

919
00:59:11,548 --> 00:59:14,449
<i>I guess I just really miss</i>
<i>sleeping with women.</i>

920
00:59:22,189 --> 00:59:24,419
That's perfectly understandable.

921
00:59:31,231 --> 00:59:35,258
<i>It's clear from your history, you have</i>
<i>a greater sexual interest in women than men.</i>

922
00:59:36,370 --> 00:59:38,235
Good.

923
00:59:38,338 --> 00:59:41,501
<i>Then you won't mind</i>
<i>if I ask Mac to have sex with me?</i>

924
00:59:42,876 --> 00:59:46,277
I mean, only if it appeals to you,
of course.

925
00:59:48,448 --> 00:59:52,077
- Would it be separately or together?
- Oh, definitely just you and I.

926
00:59:53,286 --> 00:59:55,686
Oh, I think I might like that.

927
00:59:55,789 --> 00:59:57,814
What do you think, Prok?

928
01:00:06,767 --> 01:00:10,294
<i>Mac. The Rockefeller Foundation</i>
<i>is coming today.</i>

929
01:00:10,404 --> 01:00:15,171
You-You know,
I enjoy this... tremendously.

930
01:00:17,544 --> 01:00:20,012
We still have to catalog
those prints, Martin.

931
01:00:20,113 --> 01:00:21,243
<i>- Please.</i>
- Coming, Prok.

932
01:00:21,278 --> 01:00:22,373
<i>- Please.</i>
- Coming, Prok.

933
01:00:23,950 --> 01:00:26,714
- It's just... It's a very full day.
<i>- Mm-hmm.</i>

934
01:00:26,820 --> 01:00:28,522
Coming!

935
01:00:28,822 --> 01:00:32,724
<i> One key to understanding</i>
<i>a foreign culture is its pornography.</i>

936
01:00:32,826 --> 01:00:36,125
<i>Every culture produces</i>
<i>its own peculiar sexual imagery...</i>

937
01:00:36,229 --> 01:00:38,129
<i>as distinct as its cuisine.</i>

938
01:00:38,231 --> 01:00:42,031
<i>As you can see, Brazil's imagery</i>
<i>tends towards zoophilia...</i>

939
01:00:42,135 --> 01:00:44,660
while Italy favors nuns and priests.

940
01:00:44,771 --> 01:00:48,468
In England, one often sees depictions
of the stern headmistress...

941
01:00:48,575 --> 01:00:50,372
wankers and spankers.

942
01:00:50,477 --> 01:00:55,039
<i>While in the Far East,</i>
<i>it's soft "flage"and light bondage.</i>

943
01:00:55,148 --> 01:00:57,673
You've amassed
an impressive collection.

944
01:00:57,784 --> 01:01:01,811
Thank you. Only what I've been able
to afford from my own savings.

945
01:01:01,922 --> 01:01:05,119
<i>But if the Rockefeller Foundation</i>
<i>agrees to our grant...</i>

946
01:01:05,225 --> 01:01:08,353
<i>some of that money will help us</i>
<i>build a worid-class library.</i>

947
01:01:08,462 --> 01:01:11,488
<i>Um, Herman? That's 200 years old.</i>

948
01:01:11,598 --> 01:01:16,035
- Oh.
- Have you any idea when you might decide?

949
01:01:16,136 --> 01:01:19,833
<i>Prok, please, Dr. Gregg just got here.</i>

950
01:01:19,940 --> 01:01:23,000
Sometimes I'm amazed anything has survived.

951
01:01:24,311 --> 01:01:26,541
The Library of Congress has a policy...

952
01:01:26,646 --> 01:01:29,342
of destroying whatever
it considers too erotic.

953
01:01:29,449 --> 01:01:33,613
The loss to science has been, uh, incalculable.

954
01:01:33,720 --> 01:01:36,621
There's plenty of time to take
your sex histories before dinner.

955
01:01:36,723 --> 01:01:38,623
Who'd like to go first?

956
01:01:40,527 --> 01:01:42,222
I...

957
01:01:42,329 --> 01:01:45,890
I- I... I don't, uh...

958
01:01:45,999 --> 01:01:49,696
Early in my bug-hunting days,
someone asked me what I was looking for.

959
01:01:49,803 --> 01:01:53,136
I said I wouldn't know
until I saw it statistically.

960
01:01:53,240 --> 01:01:56,266
A scientist can only generalize
with reliable certainty...

961
01:01:56,376 --> 01:01:58,901
if he has enough
statistical information.

962
01:01:59,012 --> 01:02:01,037
<i>Is this your first time</i>
<i>in Bloomington, Dr. Gregg?</i>

963
01:02:01,148 --> 01:02:04,982
Yes. It's lovely.
Hillier than I expected.

964
01:02:05,085 --> 01:02:07,952
<i> That's why I've broken</i>
<i>the American population down...</i>

965
01:02:08,054 --> 01:02:10,682
<i>into 200 major social subgroups.</i>

966
01:02:10,790 --> 01:02:14,191
We'll get anywhere from 400
to a thousand histories from each group...

967
01:02:14,294 --> 01:02:17,559
for a total of 100,000,
give or take a few.

968
01:02:17,664 --> 01:02:20,792
It could take 20 years, but, at the end,
we'll finally be able to answer...

969
01:02:20,901 --> 01:02:23,893
most of the basic questions
about human sexuality.

970
01:02:24,004 --> 01:02:26,097
Herman, is the pot roast dry?

971
01:02:26,206 --> 01:02:28,265
No. It's delicious.

972
01:02:28,375 --> 01:02:31,242
<i>The first publication</i>
<i>will be a male volume...</i>

973
01:02:31,344 --> 01:02:33,812
followed a year later
by the female study...

974
01:02:33,914 --> 01:02:37,645
then another nine books dealing
with sex offenders, homosexuality...

975
01:02:37,751 --> 01:02:40,311
pregnancy and abortion and art...

976
01:02:40,420 --> 01:02:42,445
studied from a sexual standpoint,
of course.

977
01:02:42,556 --> 01:02:46,014
<i>With the children gone,</i>
<i>I don't get to cook big meals anymore.</i>

978
01:02:46,126 --> 01:02:48,094
Mac. Let's get to the point.

979
01:02:48,195 --> 01:02:50,959
<i>This project is one of</i>
<i>the greatest ever undertaken...</i>

980
01:02:51,064 --> 01:02:53,532
<i>in connection</i>
<i>with the human animal.</i>

981
01:02:53,633 --> 01:02:57,364
But without support from the Rockefeller
Foundation, it will never get off the ground.

982
01:03:01,675 --> 01:03:05,270
There are those who argue that...

983
01:03:05,378 --> 01:03:10,611
sex is largely a matter of feelings
and psychological attitudes...

984
01:03:10,717 --> 01:03:13,982
<i>things beyond your training</i>
<i>as a zoologist.</i>

985
01:03:14,087 --> 01:03:18,820
That's like saying a biochemist can't
analyze cooking because he's not a chef.

986
01:03:18,925 --> 01:03:21,655
- It's inane.
- Prok, come on.

987
01:03:21,761 --> 01:03:25,162
That is, it's really a very stupid way
of looking at things.

988
01:03:25,265 --> 01:03:28,860
<i>One of the aims of science</i>
<i>is to simplify.</i>

989
01:03:28,969 --> 01:03:32,530
The only way to study sex
with any scientific accuracy...

990
01:03:32,639 --> 01:03:36,575
is to strip away everything
but its physiological functions.

991
01:03:36,676 --> 01:03:39,042
And this team you're proposing?

992
01:03:39,145 --> 01:03:41,670
I'll need two pair of hands at least...
both with advanced degrees in science.

993
01:03:41,781 --> 01:03:43,681
And Clyde Martin, of course.

994
01:03:43,783 --> 01:03:46,251
<i> Since you're working</i>
<i>in such a delicate area...</i>

995
01:03:46,353 --> 01:03:49,413
they need to be as clean
as Fuller Brush men.

996
01:03:49,522 --> 01:03:51,217
Um...

997
01:03:51,324 --> 01:03:54,691
<i>Door-to-door salesmen, Prok.</i>

998
01:03:54,794 --> 01:03:57,592
<i>I think what Dr. Gregg is saying</i>
<i>is that anyone involved in the project...</i>

999
01:03:57,697 --> 01:04:02,225
needs to have motives that are entirely pure
and scientific and above reproach morally.

1000
01:04:02,335 --> 01:04:05,395
- I couldn't agree more.
<i>- Ah.</i>

1001
01:04:05,505 --> 01:04:08,497
- Now, there's one more thing.
- Mm-hmm?

1002
01:04:08,608 --> 01:04:13,545
<i>I hope you're not planning to dwell</i>
<i>on sexual oddities and perversions.</i>

1003
01:04:13,647 --> 01:04:17,014
Science is always interested
in the rare.

1004
01:04:17,117 --> 01:04:21,019
<i>Yes, but it's advisable</i>
<i>to stick to what's normal.</i>

1005
01:04:21,121 --> 01:04:23,089
You don't want to shake people up.

1006
01:04:28,795 --> 01:04:32,287
Of course not.
I'm just a taxonomist... a measurer.

1007
01:04:32,399 --> 01:04:34,959
I'm happy to leave
the social policies to others.

1008
01:04:35,068 --> 01:04:37,628
Ah. Ah.

1009
01:04:37,737 --> 01:04:40,467
<i>Well, that all sounds good.</i>
<i>Very good.</i>

1010
01:04:42,008 --> 01:04:43,908
So, if you're ready...

1011
01:04:44,010 --> 01:04:46,240
I'd like to begin with
a few background questions.

1012
01:04:46,346 --> 01:04:48,610
<i>No. All wrong. Start by putting</i>
<i>the subject at ease.</i>

1013
01:04:48,645 --> 01:04:50,875
<i>No. All wrong. Start by putting</i>
<i>the subject at ease.</i>

1014
01:04:50,984 --> 01:04:54,613
- Would you care for a drink, Mac?
- Why, a glass of water would be very nice.

1015
01:04:54,721 --> 01:04:57,053
Do anything fun this weekend?

1016
01:04:57,157 --> 01:04:59,125
My daughters were in town,
so I never stopped.

1017
01:04:59,225 --> 01:05:01,659
We had a marvelous meal
Saturday night.

1018
01:05:01,761 --> 01:05:03,888
- Really? What did you cook?
- I started with a little...

1019
01:05:03,997 --> 01:05:05,965
See how much more relaxed
she's become?

1020
01:05:06,066 --> 01:05:07,966
If you ease in
with innocuous questions...

1021
01:05:08,068 --> 01:05:10,332
people forget
they're giving sex histories.

1022
01:05:10,437 --> 01:05:12,667
How did you first
find out about masturbation?

1023
01:05:12,772 --> 01:05:14,797
I invented it, son.

1024
01:05:14,908 --> 01:05:17,900
Sometimes I tie a rope
around my balls when I jerk off.

1025
01:05:18,011 --> 01:05:21,947
- And what other masochistic acts do you enjoy?
- Does that mean "queer"?

1026
01:05:22,048 --> 01:05:24,448
How often do you have intercourse?

1027
01:05:24,551 --> 01:05:27,520
- Two or three times.
- A month?

1028
01:05:27,620 --> 01:05:30,282
- No, a day.
<i>- Mmm.</i>

1029
01:05:31,558 --> 01:05:33,788
How often do you reach orgasm?

1030
01:05:33,893 --> 01:05:36,453
- Once.
- A day?

1031
01:05:36,563 --> 01:05:38,963
No. Only once.

1032
01:05:39,065 --> 01:05:40,999
<i>About 20 years ago.</i>

1033
01:05:41,101 --> 01:05:43,865
I was sitting on a piano stool
listening to music.

1034
01:05:43,970 --> 01:05:45,961
Mm. Oh, that's good.

1035
01:05:46,072 --> 01:05:49,439
How old were you when you first engaged
in sexual activity with a partner?

1036
01:05:49,542 --> 01:05:52,670
- Fourteen.
- How?

1037
01:05:52,779 --> 01:05:55,077
With horse.

1038
01:05:57,584 --> 01:06:00,712
How often were you having intercourse
with animals at age 14?

1039
01:06:00,820 --> 01:06:03,789
Is true. I fucked a pony.

1040
01:06:03,890 --> 01:06:05,790
You are genius.
How did you know?

1041
01:06:05,892 --> 01:06:09,794
You just said
you had sex with a horse.

1042
01:06:09,896 --> 01:06:12,091
No<i>. Whores.</i>

1043
01:06:12,198 --> 01:06:14,189
Not horse<i>. Whores.</i>

1044
01:06:14,300 --> 01:06:16,359
Do you find my answers typical?

1045
01:06:16,469 --> 01:06:18,801
- Am I normal?
- Am I normal?

1046
01:06:18,905 --> 01:06:20,805
<i>Am I normal?</i>

1047
01:06:22,909 --> 01:06:26,970
<i>Yes. I found a book</i>
<i>in the dining room buffet...</i>

1048
01:06:27,080 --> 01:06:31,210
under all the tablecloths,
and I used to put it under my shirt...

1049
01:06:31,317 --> 01:06:33,751
and go into the bathroom
and sit and read it.

1050
01:06:33,853 --> 01:06:35,753
But I was very frightened.

1051
01:06:35,855 --> 01:06:40,019
<i>- She told her mother</i>
<i>that she didn't like it.</i>
- How will I get it back?

1052
01:06:40,126 --> 01:06:44,392
Or maybe it was just
her mother who didn't like it.

1053
01:06:44,497 --> 01:06:47,295
Before you know it,
the police bangin' on the front door.

1054
01:06:49,569 --> 01:06:52,902
Hell, I didn't even know it was illegal.

1055
01:06:53,006 --> 01:06:55,839
- Now I'm in here for five years.
- One of them old gals
caught me out in the field.

1056
01:06:55,942 --> 01:06:59,810
I guess I was about nine, 10.

1057
01:06:59,913 --> 01:07:04,213
And she say she was gonna
show me a new game called "puddin'."

1058
01:07:04,317 --> 01:07:07,718
And, well, I guess I kinda liked it.

1059
01:07:07,821 --> 01:07:12,417
Horses in the stable, and by watching them...

1060
01:07:12,525 --> 01:07:17,224
The father said, "I put my roll of bills
in your mother's pocketbook...

1061
01:07:17,330 --> 01:07:19,321
- and I got you for change."
- But it felt good.

1062
01:07:38,518 --> 01:07:42,318
<i>- I saw myself as nasty and terrible...</i>
<i>- I believe in God...</i>

1063
01:07:44,958 --> 01:07:46,858
<i>I went to my mother...</i>

1064
01:07:48,161 --> 01:07:50,891
<i>"Mama, is this true?</i>

1065
01:07:50,997 --> 01:07:53,693
<i>Do men put their thing in women?"</i>

1066
01:07:57,003 --> 01:07:58,971
<i>I only did it that one time.</i>

1067
01:08:02,275 --> 01:08:06,075
<i>If you weren't a virgin, you were</i>
<i>a fallen woman. Nobody would want you.</i>

1068
01:08:06,179 --> 01:08:08,841
Tested us for, uh,
masculine and feminine traits.

1069
01:08:08,948 --> 01:08:11,314
- They were both naked.
- It was part of me.

1070
01:08:37,076 --> 01:08:39,237
You may kiss the bride.

1071
01:08:46,753 --> 01:08:49,813
<i>Did you hear Professor Kinsey</i>
<i>found a place for us to live?</i>

1072
01:08:49,923 --> 01:08:52,517
Oh, let me guess.
It's just a few blocks from here.

1073
01:08:52,625 --> 01:08:55,822
- How did you know?
- He likes to keep the troops in one place.

1074
01:08:55,929 --> 01:08:58,489
At least you passed the test.

1075
01:08:58,598 --> 01:09:01,624
- What do you mean?
- Well, he took your sex history, didn't he?

1076
01:09:01,734 --> 01:09:03,326
Mm-hmm.

1077
01:09:03,436 --> 01:09:06,701
<i>Well, he wouldn't have let Clyde</i>
<i>marry you unless you fit in.</i>

1078
01:09:06,806 --> 01:09:11,209
<i>Uh, didn't Clyde mention</i>
<i>the calendars?</i>

1079
01:09:11,311 --> 01:09:14,678
Prok likes for us to keep a record
of our sexual activity.

1080
01:09:14,781 --> 01:09:18,217
<i>- Tell them about that dream</i>
<i>you had the other night.</i>
- Mmm!

1081
01:09:18,318 --> 01:09:22,414
I was in the middle of
the most intense erotic encounter...

1082
01:09:22,522 --> 01:09:25,218
- He wouldn't say who with.
- When all of a sudden the doors flew open...

1083
01:09:25,325 --> 01:09:28,317
and there was Prok standing there
with that stern look of his.

1084
01:09:28,428 --> 01:09:31,693
"Gebhard, hurry up! You're wasting countless
thousands of hours of project time."

1085
01:09:31,798 --> 01:09:34,028
<i>Well, needless to say,</i>
<i>the mood was broken.</i>

1086
01:09:34,133 --> 01:09:38,035
So he woke up, and I had to take over.
It was the quickest orgasm he ever had.

1087
01:09:38,137 --> 01:09:41,038
<i>We're trying to get pregnant again...</i>

1088
01:09:41,140 --> 01:09:43,870
so, uh, there was no raincoat
to dull the sensation.

1089
01:09:43,977 --> 01:09:45,877
Oh.

1090
01:09:45,979 --> 01:09:48,345
Do the Kinseys know
that you talk like this?

1091
01:09:48,448 --> 01:09:51,508
<i>Uh...</i>

1092
01:09:51,618 --> 01:09:55,054
- Could I get a picture?
- Um...

1093
01:09:55,154 --> 01:09:57,247
why don't you call me when you
get back from the honeymoon?

1094
01:09:57,357 --> 01:09:59,257
We'll have a nice long lunch.

1095
01:09:59,359 --> 01:10:01,725
- Look at the birdie.
- Oh.

1096
01:10:01,828 --> 01:10:04,422
<i>No, I've got the report.</i>
<i>Thank you.</i>

1097
01:10:04,530 --> 01:10:09,331
<i> Uh, often among boys</i>
<i>who live in cities and towns, comma...</i>

1098
01:10:09,435 --> 01:10:12,734
<i>Less often among farm boys, period.</i>

1099
01:10:12,839 --> 01:10:15,467
<i> Perhaps you wanna say</i>
<i>"boys from small towns"...</i>

1100
01:10:15,575 --> 01:10:18,339
<i>- instead of"farm boys."</i>
- Say-Say farm boys. Farm boys.

1101
01:10:18,444 --> 01:10:20,708
What's the difference?
He's gonna rewrite it anyway.

1102
01:10:20,813 --> 01:10:22,713
Henry.

1103
01:10:22,815 --> 01:10:24,715
Everything looks in order here.

1104
01:10:24,817 --> 01:10:26,785
You can have either Thanksgiving
or Christmas off.

1105
01:10:26,886 --> 01:10:30,049
Your choice entirely.

1106
01:10:30,156 --> 01:10:33,751
Do you need anything before I go?

1107
01:10:33,860 --> 01:10:36,624
We'll never get this book done
if people start leaving early.

1108
01:10:36,729 --> 01:10:38,629
I'll stay if you let me
help you with these.

1109
01:10:38,731 --> 01:10:40,631
You don't have the time to answer
each one personally.

1110
01:10:40,733 --> 01:10:43,133
If people take the trouble to write,
it's the least I can do.

1111
01:10:43,236 --> 01:10:45,796
Mrs. Kinsey said to remind you
to come home to eat.

1112
01:10:45,905 --> 01:10:49,773
And your father phoned again.
Do you want me to talk to him?

1113
01:10:51,110 --> 01:10:53,010
No. I'll do it.

1114
01:11:02,889 --> 01:11:05,687
<i>For thine is the kingdom...</i>

1115
01:11:05,792 --> 01:11:09,193
<i>and the power</i>
<i>and the glory forever.</i>

1116
01:11:09,295 --> 01:11:11,627
<i>- Amen.</i>
<i>- Amen.</i>

1117
01:11:13,766 --> 01:11:16,929
- Hello, Mildred.
- Mr. Morrissey.

1118
01:11:17,036 --> 01:11:19,368
Come say hello to Father.

1119
01:11:30,450 --> 01:11:33,283
I'm very sad for you, Alfred.

1120
01:11:33,386 --> 01:11:37,049
Well, it's not as though
I'll be alone.

1121
01:11:37,156 --> 01:11:39,647
My daughter's too fat
to get a husband.

1122
01:11:39,759 --> 01:11:43,718
<i>And my son's lost his business.</i>
<i>He moved back home.</i>

1123
01:11:43,830 --> 01:11:46,128
<i>The only one I got rid of</i>
<i>is the big scientist.</i>

1124
01:11:46,232 --> 01:11:50,464
Now he's working on some...
secret project.

1125
01:11:50,570 --> 01:11:52,470
He was always the secretive type.

1126
01:11:52,572 --> 01:11:56,008
<i>Would you really like to know</i>
<i>what I'm working on, Father?</i>

1127
01:11:56,109 --> 01:11:58,373
<i>Oh, listen to this.</i>
<i>He's gonna tell me his big secret.</i>

1128
01:11:58,478 --> 01:12:00,708
<i>It's really not a secret at all.</i>

1129
01:12:00,813 --> 01:12:03,373
I'm trying to find out
what people do sexually.

1130
01:12:05,985 --> 01:12:08,078
You heard right, Father.
It's a sex study.

1131
01:12:12,024 --> 01:12:14,584
Well, what do you expect me
to do, applaud?

1132
01:12:14,694 --> 01:12:16,662
No.

1133
01:12:19,599 --> 01:12:22,591
But I would like you
to contribute to the project.

1134
01:12:22,702 --> 01:12:24,169
Oh.

1135
01:12:27,206 --> 01:12:29,868
<i>And you first moved</i>
<i>to Hoboken at what age?</i>

1136
01:12:29,976 --> 01:12:32,501
Sixteen.

1137
01:12:32,612 --> 01:12:36,309
Could have done this interview
without me, Al.

1138
01:12:36,415 --> 01:12:38,747
I haven't told you a damn thing
you didn't already know.

1139
01:12:38,851 --> 01:12:40,751
Let's move on then.

1140
01:12:42,255 --> 01:12:45,554
- How young were you
when you first masturbated?
- What?

1141
01:12:45,658 --> 01:12:48,855
- Touched yourself.
- I never did that.

1142
01:12:48,961 --> 01:12:52,021
The male without a history
of masturbation is almost nonexistent.

1143
01:12:52,131 --> 01:12:55,100
Well, he exists, Al,
and you're looking at him.

1144
01:12:56,736 --> 01:12:59,603
This isn't gonna work.

1145
01:12:59,705 --> 01:13:01,673
I don't know why I bothered.

1146
01:13:03,142 --> 01:13:06,043
Stay where you are.

1147
01:13:09,282 --> 01:13:11,409
I'll try again.

1148
01:13:16,589 --> 01:13:20,457
How often did your masturbation
occur in adolescence?

1149
01:13:27,466 --> 01:13:30,162
There was a problem, a...

1150
01:13:30,269 --> 01:13:32,499
A ch...

1151
01:13:32,605 --> 01:13:36,234
"chronic condition,"
the doctors called it.

1152
01:13:36,342 --> 01:13:38,833
How long did this continue?

1153
01:13:42,081 --> 01:13:44,106
I was outfitted...

1154
01:13:45,718 --> 01:13:50,212
with a tight strap
that I had to wear at all times.

1155
01:13:50,323 --> 01:13:55,124
It... It kept me from coming
into contact with my genitals.

1156
01:13:55,228 --> 01:13:57,526
<i>It was a...</i>

1157
01:13:57,630 --> 01:14:01,828
a highly embarrassing remedy,
but it-it proved effective.

1158
01:14:01,934 --> 01:14:03,834
The condition was cured.

1159
01:14:07,974 --> 01:14:09,874
How old were you?

1160
01:14:14,480 --> 01:14:16,448
I- I was 10.

1161
01:14:25,358 --> 01:14:27,622
I'm so sorry, Dad.

1162
01:14:41,040 --> 01:14:43,031
I'm feeling a little tired now.

1163
01:14:56,389 --> 01:14:59,358
Sounds to me like you're
wasting your time, Al.

1164
01:15:01,360 --> 01:15:03,885
Nobody wants to know
about these things.

1165
01:15:08,034 --> 01:15:09,934
How are you?
When can we see Dr. Kinsey?

1166
01:15:10,036 --> 01:15:13,472
- Hey. Hey, that's him! That's Kinsey!
<i>- There he is.!</i>

1167
01:15:13,572 --> 01:15:17,008
My name is Dr. Thurman Rice...

1168
01:15:17,109 --> 01:15:19,873
and I'd be happy to talk to you
about Professor Kinsey's...

1169
01:15:19,979 --> 01:15:21,947
<i>- Over here.!</i>
- Repugnant book.

1170
01:15:22,048 --> 01:15:23,948
You are free to read and take notes...

1171
01:15:24,050 --> 01:15:26,883
but under no circumstances
is the manuscript to leave the room.

1172
01:15:26,986 --> 01:15:29,250
I won't deny the going
might get a little rough.

1173
01:15:29,355 --> 01:15:33,348
Dr. Kinsey's findings are surprising,
sometimes even shocking.

1174
01:15:33,459 --> 01:15:37,759
For example, marital sex, which is really
the only kind everyone agrees on...

1175
01:15:37,863 --> 01:15:41,458
is only one of nine means by which
the American male achieves orgasm.

1176
01:15:41,567 --> 01:15:45,196
<i>Premarital sex, extramarital sex...</i>

1177
01:15:45,304 --> 01:15:48,398
<i>masturbation and homosexuality...</i>

1178
01:15:48,507 --> 01:15:51,476
are much more prevalent than anyone
has ever imagined before.

1179
01:15:53,746 --> 01:15:56,476
<i>I can assure you that Dr. Kinsey...</i>

1180
01:15:56,582 --> 01:15:58,709
has done everything in his power...

1181
01:15:58,818 --> 01:16:00,718
to present this book tastefully.

1182
01:16:00,820 --> 01:16:03,414
<i>So, I thought this</i>
<i>might be a good time...</i>

1183
01:16:03,522 --> 01:16:05,490
to ask for a formal show of support.

1184
01:16:05,591 --> 01:16:07,286
Those in favor.

1185
01:16:22,375 --> 01:16:26,243
I just hope it's not going
to bring too much publicity.

1186
01:16:26,345 --> 01:16:28,905
With any luck, Mrs. Spaulding...

1187
01:16:29,015 --> 01:16:30,915
the general public won't even notice.

1188
01:16:31,017 --> 01:16:34,214
<i>#According to the Kinsey Report #</i>

1189
01:16:34,320 --> 01:16:37,118
<i>#Every average man you know #</i>

1190
01:16:37,223 --> 01:16:40,056
<i>#Much prefers his lovey-dovey to court #</i>

1191
01:16:40,159 --> 01:16:43,185
<i># When the temperature is low #</i>

1192
01:16:43,295 --> 01:16:46,196
<i>#But when the thermometer goes way up #</i>

1193
01:16:46,298 --> 01:16:48,664
<i>#And the weather is sizzlin'hot #</i>

1194
01:16:48,768 --> 01:16:51,965
<i>#Mr. Gob for his squab #</i>

1195
01:16:52,071 --> 01:16:55,006
- That'll be "sex-fifty" please.
<i>- #A marine for his queen #</i>

1196
01:16:55,107 --> 01:16:59,305
<i>#A G.I. For his cutie-pie is not #</i>

1197
01:16:59,412 --> 01:17:04,145
<i># 'Cause it's too, too, too darn hot ##</i>

1198
01:17:09,555 --> 01:17:11,523
<i>In an open society...</i>

1199
01:17:11,624 --> 01:17:13,524
<i>it is done through observation.</i>

1200
01:17:13,626 --> 01:17:17,892
<i>But in a Puritan culture,</i>
<i>sex remains a dirty secret...</i>

1201
01:17:17,997 --> 01:17:23,060
<i>often made dreadful through</i>
<i>plain ignorance of what to do.</i>

1202
01:17:23,169 --> 01:17:27,401
<i> Mark my words,</i>
<i>as soon as the publicity dies down...</i>

1203
01:17:27,506 --> 01:17:30,805
<i>the American public will greet this book...</i>

1204
01:17:30,910 --> 01:17:34,246
with the thundering silence it deserves.

1205
01:17:34,413 --> 01:17:36,540
What brings you to New York,
Dr. Kinsey?

1206
01:17:36,649 --> 01:17:40,312
We'll be taking the sex histories
or artists, writers and actors...

1207
01:17:40,419 --> 01:17:43,513
including the entire cast
of <i>A Streetcar Named Desire.</i>

1208
01:17:43,622 --> 01:17:47,422
We'll also be interviewing women
for our next book, which is a female study...

1209
01:17:47,526 --> 01:17:50,086
<i>as well as meeting with our benefactors</i>
<i>at the Rockefeller Foundation.</i>

1210
01:17:50,196 --> 01:17:52,096
<i>Are you surprised</i>
<i>at the success of your book?</i>

1211
01:17:52,198 --> 01:17:54,689
<i>No. It shows that the worid</i>
<i>has wanted this done.</i>

1212
01:17:54,800 --> 01:17:57,394
<i>Any plans on a Hollywood picture</i>
<i>based on the book?</i>

1213
01:17:57,503 --> 01:17:59,733
I can't think of anything more pointless.

1214
01:17:59,839 --> 01:18:01,739
What about you, Mrs. Kinsey?

1215
01:18:01,841 --> 01:18:03,604
Has your life changed much?

1216
01:18:03,709 --> 01:18:07,668
My husband's busier than ever.
I hardly see him since he's taken up sex.

1217
01:18:07,780 --> 01:18:10,271
<i> What about</i>
<i>this female study, Mrs. Kinsey?</i>

1218
01:18:12,852 --> 01:18:15,514
Gentlemen.
Gentlemen, gentlemen. Please.

1219
01:18:15,621 --> 01:18:17,816
If you want to write
about something useful...

1220
01:18:17,923 --> 01:18:20,687
I suggest you look into
the current sex offender codes.

1221
01:18:20,793 --> 01:18:23,762
<i>The majority of sex offenders</i>
<i>in our prisons...</i>

1222
01:18:23,863 --> 01:18:28,027
have nothing in their histories different
from the rest of the population.

1223
01:18:28,134 --> 01:18:31,592
Their only crime is being too poor
to hire a lawyer.

1224
01:18:31,704 --> 01:18:35,037
This is unfair.
Everybody's sin is nobody's sin.

1225
01:18:35,141 --> 01:18:37,905
And everybody's crime
is no crime at all.

1226
01:18:40,379 --> 01:18:43,212
"Everybody's sin is nobody's sin."

1227
01:18:43,315 --> 01:18:45,510
That wasn't my point at all.

1228
01:18:45,618 --> 01:18:49,952
The newspapers lift things out of context
to make sensational reading.

1229
01:18:50,055 --> 01:18:53,115
Still, it's hardly your place
to offer moral prescriptions.

1230
01:18:53,225 --> 01:18:55,989
You're sounding more like
a- a preacher than a scientist.

1231
01:18:58,097 --> 01:19:00,622
My father always hoped
I'd become a preacher.

1232
01:19:00,733 --> 01:19:05,227
And why do you insist on flaunting
your association with the foundation?

1233
01:19:05,337 --> 01:19:08,932
<i>Haven't I just given you the best-selling</i>
<i>scientific volume ever published?</i>

1234
01:19:09,041 --> 01:19:11,305
- Not only here but across the globe.
<i>- Yes.</i>

1235
01:19:11,410 --> 01:19:16,109
And it's casting a bright light
on every aspect of the project...

1236
01:19:16,215 --> 01:19:19,912
especially some
of your latest methodology.

1237
01:19:22,421 --> 01:19:25,185
Who have you been talking to?

1238
01:19:25,291 --> 01:19:28,522
- Well, I assume that most of it is gossip.
- Alan.

1239
01:19:30,462 --> 01:19:33,397
It's been said that, uh...

1240
01:19:33,499 --> 01:19:36,957
you've taken to observing women.

1241
01:19:38,404 --> 01:19:42,932
- Go on.
- In a heightened state of arousal.

1242
01:19:45,144 --> 01:19:47,476
It's true?

1243
01:19:47,580 --> 01:19:50,811
Yes. And do you know why?

1244
01:19:50,916 --> 01:19:54,943
<i>We went to the leading gynecologists</i>
<i>and asked for physical measurements...</i>

1245
01:19:55,054 --> 01:19:57,750
and they barely knew
what we were talking about.

1246
01:19:57,856 --> 01:20:00,086
When it comes to female sex organs...

1247
01:20:00,192 --> 01:20:02,217
we're all tragically ignorant.

1248
01:20:02,328 --> 01:20:05,229
Who are these women?

1249
01:20:05,331 --> 01:20:09,392
- Volunteers. Friends of the project.
- Prostitutes.

1250
01:20:09,501 --> 01:20:14,336
No. Prostitutes are useless.
They fake their orgasms.

1251
01:20:14,440 --> 01:20:16,704
- Jesus...
<i>- Alan.</i>

1252
01:20:16,809 --> 01:20:18,709
The sex histories we have
are invaluable.

1253
01:20:18,811 --> 01:20:23,214
Everyone knows true science
lies in direct observation.

1254
01:20:23,315 --> 01:20:26,648
Nothing can replace
what the eye can see directly.

1255
01:20:26,752 --> 01:20:29,721
- Or the camera.
- Camera?

1256
01:20:29,822 --> 01:20:32,313
Don't tell me.
Y- You're making movies?

1257
01:20:32,424 --> 01:20:36,690
Just some photographic studies
of mammalian behavior.

1258
01:20:36,795 --> 01:20:39,821
Oh. Nature films.

1259
01:20:39,932 --> 01:20:41,832
Animals.

1260
01:20:41,934 --> 01:20:44,801
Yes, if you like.

1261
01:20:49,808 --> 01:20:53,005
Gentlemen, you're about to meet
a truly rare creature.

1262
01:20:53,112 --> 01:20:56,946
<i>Even the most casual contact</i>
<i>arouses a sexual response in her.</i>

1263
01:20:57,049 --> 01:20:59,483
In intercourse,
her first orgasm occurs...

1264
01:20:59,585 --> 01:21:02,918
within two to five seconds after entry.

1265
01:21:03,022 --> 01:21:06,014
- All set there, Barbara?
<i>- I think so.</i>

1266
01:21:06,125 --> 01:21:08,093
Come on in.

1267
01:21:13,732 --> 01:21:16,292
- Hello.
- How do you do?

1268
01:21:16,402 --> 01:21:20,099
Did I mention that Barbara didn't have
her first orgasm until she was 40?

1269
01:21:22,808 --> 01:21:26,744
Notice how she gently strokes
the inner lips and the clitoris.

1270
01:21:26,845 --> 01:21:29,871
<i>Eighty-four percent of our sample</i>
<i>stimulate themselves in this way.</i>

1271
01:21:29,982 --> 01:21:32,416
What about the vagina?

1272
01:21:32,518 --> 01:21:35,544
For all but a small minority of women,
the vaginal tube is a dead cavity...

1273
01:21:35,654 --> 01:21:38,418
<i>practically devoid of nerve endings.</i>

1274
01:21:38,524 --> 01:21:40,992
As you can see,
the introduction of the penis...

1275
01:21:41,093 --> 01:21:44,494
does nothing to relocate
the source of stimulation...

1276
01:21:44,596 --> 01:21:47,588
even with as skillful a partner
as Pomeroy.

1277
01:21:47,700 --> 01:21:51,397
- That is you, isn't it?
- Last time I looked.

1278
01:21:51,503 --> 01:21:56,600
<i>For years, women have been told that</i>
<i>a clitoral orgasm is immature, neurotic.</i>

1279
01:21:56,709 --> 01:21:58,609
So they've struggled with great anxiety...

1280
01:21:58,711 --> 01:22:01,111
to relocate the orgasm in the vagina...

1281
01:22:01,213 --> 01:22:04,273
<i>when, for many,</i>
<i>it's a biologic impossibility.</i>

1282
01:22:06,552 --> 01:22:10,249
According to the psychoanalysts,
this woman is frigid.

1283
01:22:12,758 --> 01:22:14,658
<i>Good news, everyone.</i>

1284
01:22:14,760 --> 01:22:18,423
<i>The Rockefeller Foundation</i>
<i>announced its annual grants today.</i>

1285
01:22:18,530 --> 01:22:21,226
We've received $40,000
for the next year...

1286
01:22:21,333 --> 01:22:24,427
the highest grant they've ever bestowed
on a scientific project.

1287
01:22:24,536 --> 01:22:26,436
Well.

1288
01:22:26,538 --> 01:22:29,507
And they've agreed to underwrite
a new corporation...

1289
01:22:29,608 --> 01:22:32,975
making us future employees
of the Institute for Sex Research.

1290
01:22:34,880 --> 01:22:37,314
- To Dr. Kinsey.
- Hear! Hear!

1291
01:22:37,416 --> 01:22:39,782
- And Mrs. Kinsey.
- Hear! Hear!

1292
01:22:39,885 --> 01:22:42,945
And to our husbands...
the Fuller Brush men of sex.

1293
01:22:43,055 --> 01:22:46,047
Come here, my little prick nibbler.

1294
01:22:46,158 --> 01:22:48,991
Oh.

1295
01:22:49,094 --> 01:22:51,255
<i>Come on. Everyone, enjoy yourselves.</i>

1296
01:22:52,898 --> 01:22:55,526
Ah. You don't look happy.

1297
01:22:55,634 --> 01:22:57,534
No, I am. Really.

1298
01:22:57,636 --> 01:23:00,537
It's just that Clyde is going
to be away for so long this time.

1299
01:23:00,639 --> 01:23:04,302
Ah. Well, don't worry.
I'll keep an eye on him.

1300
01:23:04,410 --> 01:23:06,378
A lot of good that will do.

1301
01:23:07,980 --> 01:23:09,948
What are you trying to say,
Mrs. Martin?

1302
01:23:11,450 --> 01:23:14,647
God, you're pretty.

1303
01:23:14,753 --> 01:23:16,653
<i>- Drink up your grapejuice, gentlemen.</i>

1304
01:23:16,755 --> 01:23:19,053
<i>We have gathered only 9,300 histories...</i>

1305
01:23:19,158 --> 01:23:21,490
<i>and we have</i>
<i>the female volume to complete.</i>

1306
01:23:21,593 --> 01:23:24,027
Starting tomorrow,
we need to triple our efforts.

1307
01:23:24,129 --> 01:23:27,929
<i>Well, it's still tonight, and since</i>
<i>my third leg keeps hittin'me in the face...</i>

1308
01:23:28,033 --> 01:23:29,933
I think it's time for a tumble.

1309
01:23:46,518 --> 01:23:50,921
In the bonobo chimpanzee...
our nearest primate relation...

1310
01:23:51,023 --> 01:23:54,982
sex is the glue
of social cohesion and peace.

1311
01:23:55,093 --> 01:23:57,459
<i>Cleared of notions like romantic love...</i>

1312
01:23:57,563 --> 01:23:59,895
<i>or religion or morality...</i>

1313
01:23:59,998 --> 01:24:02,125
<i>their society's behavior</i>
<i>hangs together...</i>

1314
01:24:02,234 --> 01:24:05,635
<i>as a coherent unit</i>
<i>ofbiology and conditioning.</i>

1315
01:24:05,737 --> 01:24:10,436
<i>Based on the experiences of females</i>
<i>who have contributed to our histories...</i>

1316
01:24:10,542 --> 01:24:15,912
<i>we have observed a wide range</i>
<i>of motivations for extramarital coitus.</i>

1317
01:24:16,014 --> 01:24:21,953
<i>At times, it is a conscious or unconscious</i>
<i>attempt to acquire social status.</i>

1318
01:24:22,054 --> 01:24:24,955
<i>In other instances,</i>
<i>it gives them a variety of experiences...</i>

1319
01:24:25,057 --> 01:24:29,653
<i>with new sexual partners who are sometimes</i>
<i>superior to their marriage partner.</i>

1320
01:24:31,663 --> 01:24:34,325
<i>There are occasions</i>
<i>when it is done in retaliation...</i>

1321
01:24:34,433 --> 01:24:36,526
<i>for the partner's</i>
<i>extramarital activity...</i>

1322
01:24:36,635 --> 01:24:39,695
<i>or for some sort</i>
<i>of nonsexual mistreatment.</i>

1323
01:24:42,574 --> 01:24:46,908
<i>Some females discover new sources</i>
<i>of emotional satisfaction...</i>

1324
01:24:47,012 --> 01:24:50,413
<i>while others find it impossible to share</i>
<i>such an intimate relationship...</i>

1325
01:24:50,516 --> 01:24:52,746
<i>with more than one partner.</i>

1326
01:24:56,922 --> 01:24:59,948
<i>We have also encountered</i>
<i>a considerable group of cases...</i>

1327
01:25:00,058 --> 01:25:04,995
<i>in which husbands encourage their wives</i>
<i>to engage in extramarital activities...</i>

1328
01:25:05,097 --> 01:25:07,463
<i>in an honest attempt</i>
<i>to give them the opportunity...</i>

1329
01:25:07,566 --> 01:25:10,126
<i>for additional sexual satisfaction.</i>

1330
01:25:27,819 --> 01:25:30,549
<i> I've corresponded with</i>
<i>this man for over 10 years, Pomeroy...</i>

1331
01:25:30,656 --> 01:25:33,250
<i>but I never thought he'd agree to meet.</i>

1332
01:25:33,358 --> 01:25:37,124
<i>He's amassed a lifetime of data.</i>

1333
01:25:37,229 --> 01:25:41,097
<i>Working for the Forestry Department</i>
<i>has involved a lot of traveling...</i>

1334
01:25:41,199 --> 01:25:45,329
so I've met a wide array of people.

1335
01:25:45,437 --> 01:25:47,905
- By the way, my name is...
- Please. There's no need.

1336
01:25:48,006 --> 01:25:51,407
Kenneth Braun.
Don't worry, Dr. Kinsey.

1337
01:25:51,510 --> 01:25:53,478
I trust you.

1338
01:25:54,780 --> 01:25:56,748
We're actually a lot alike, you know.

1339
01:25:56,848 --> 01:25:59,510
- How so?
<i>- I record everything too...</i>

1340
01:25:59,618 --> 01:26:01,711
<i>the depth of every vagina</i>
<i>I've encountered...</i>

1341
01:26:01,820 --> 01:26:05,051
the length and circumference
of every penis...

1342
01:26:05,157 --> 01:26:07,148
the time to reach orgasm...

1343
01:26:07,259 --> 01:26:09,227
<i>the distance of ejaculation.</i>

1344
01:26:09,328 --> 01:26:11,489
<i>I've written it all down.</i>

1345
01:26:13,398 --> 01:26:17,391
This is the record of my...
my life's real work...

1346
01:26:17,502 --> 01:26:20,062
<i>which is sex, by the way.</i>

1347
01:26:20,172 --> 01:26:23,801
Um, I find that recording is a...

1348
01:26:23,909 --> 01:26:27,675
is a way to experience things
a second time, don't you?

1349
01:26:29,514 --> 01:26:34,178
<i>I also have certain... rare abilities.</i>

1350
01:26:35,354 --> 01:26:37,914
From a completely flaccid start...

1351
01:26:38,023 --> 01:26:43,359
I can become erect and ejaculate
in 10 seconds flat.

1352
01:26:43,462 --> 01:26:48,195
I'd say that's pretty much
physiologically impossible.

1353
01:26:48,300 --> 01:26:50,700
<i>Why, the rush ofblood alone would...</i>

1354
01:27:04,049 --> 01:27:07,746
Oh! Oh!

1355
01:27:13,358 --> 01:27:15,258
Shall we get started?

1356
01:27:15,360 --> 01:27:19,319
<i>My grandmother introduced me</i>
<i>to sexual intercourse when I was 10.</i>

1357
01:27:19,431 --> 01:27:23,731
My first homosexual act
was, uh, with my father.

1358
01:27:23,835 --> 01:27:25,769
Uh, I was 11...

1359
01:27:25,871 --> 01:27:28,101
Of the 33 members
of my extended family...

1360
01:27:28,206 --> 01:27:30,834
I've had sex with 17 of them.

1361
01:27:30,942 --> 01:27:32,910
That's five generations now.

1362
01:27:33,011 --> 01:27:35,377
My penis is 8.24 inches long...

1363
01:27:35,480 --> 01:27:39,473
with a diameter of 2.8 inches
when fully erect.

1364
01:27:39,584 --> 01:27:44,351
In my youth, I averaged eight cubic
centimeters of semen per ejaculation.

1365
01:27:44,456 --> 01:27:47,448
By the time I was 50,
I was down to five.

1366
01:27:47,559 --> 01:27:50,653
I've had sex with 22
separate species of animals.

1367
01:27:50,762 --> 01:27:54,892
<i>I've had intercourse</i>
<i>with 9,412 people.</i>

1368
01:27:55,967 --> 01:27:59,232
I've had sexual relations with...

1369
01:28:00,739 --> 01:28:04,937
605 preadolescent males and...

1370
01:28:07,045 --> 01:28:10,776
231 preadolescent females.

1371
01:28:12,317 --> 01:28:14,785
Have you ever seen a boy orgasm?

1372
01:28:14,886 --> 01:28:17,047
No.

1373
01:28:19,424 --> 01:28:21,392
<i>No, right.</i>

1374
01:28:21,493 --> 01:28:23,984
I guess that's why I'm such a catch.

1375
01:28:24,096 --> 01:28:28,999
<i>Physiologically, it's almost identical</i>
<i>to an adult orgasm.</i>

1376
01:28:29,101 --> 01:28:31,899
Screw this.
I'll see you down at the bar.

1377
01:28:41,680 --> 01:28:43,807
I thought you trained them
to be impartial.

1378
01:28:45,317 --> 01:28:47,410
Sometimes it's difficult.

1379
01:28:47,519 --> 01:28:50,955
Yeah, well,
I suppose someone like me...

1380
01:28:51,056 --> 01:28:53,490
really puts your beliefs
to the test, huh?

1381
01:28:53,592 --> 01:28:55,856
- How?
- You know.

1382
01:28:55,961 --> 01:28:59,692
- Everybody should do what they want.
- I've never said that.

1383
01:28:59,798 --> 01:29:02,790
<i>No one should be forced to do</i>
<i>anything against their will.</i>

1384
01:29:02,901 --> 01:29:05,131
No one should ever be hurt.

1385
01:29:07,005 --> 01:29:10,338
You know, you're a lot more square
than I thought you'd be.

1386
01:29:12,677 --> 01:29:15,271
Let's get on with it.

1387
01:29:16,681 --> 01:29:18,581
Sure.

1388
01:29:42,741 --> 01:29:44,868
<i>Please, Governor.</i>

1389
01:29:44,976 --> 01:29:46,944
<i>You're so angry, I can't reason with you.</i>

1390
01:29:47,045 --> 01:29:50,537
When you calm down, we'll discuss it.

1391
01:29:51,950 --> 01:29:55,317
Seems that the archbishop of Fort Wayne...

1392
01:29:55,420 --> 01:29:57,320
tipped off the customs board.

1393
01:29:57,422 --> 01:30:02,291
What is it with these people? They're simply
depictions of man in his natural state.

1394
01:30:03,528 --> 01:30:06,088
I don't know much
about natural states, Prok...

1395
01:30:06,198 --> 01:30:09,224
but here in the state of Indiana
we have a problem.

1396
01:30:09,334 --> 01:30:12,132
We'll just have to take
the customs office to court.

1397
01:30:12,237 --> 01:30:14,501
And who's gonna pay for that,
the Rockefeller Foundation?

1398
01:30:14,606 --> 01:30:16,597
You're an inch away
from losing your grant as it is.

1399
01:30:16,708 --> 01:30:20,109
That's not true.
What do you mean?

1400
01:30:20,212 --> 01:30:22,305
Hoover is still annoyed
that you won't help him...

1401
01:30:22,414 --> 01:30:25,144
find homosexuals
in the State Department.

1402
01:30:27,319 --> 01:30:32,313
It is rumored that he is
compiling dossiers... on you...

1403
01:30:34,059 --> 01:30:36,926
the activities of your staff.

1404
01:30:37,028 --> 01:30:41,362
<i>And, as you well know, there have been</i>
<i>complaints about your statistical methods.</i>

1405
01:30:41,466 --> 01:30:43,491
Trumped-up nonsense.

1406
01:30:43,602 --> 01:30:46,093
Nothing but disguised prudery.

1407
01:30:46,204 --> 01:30:48,570
Prok.

1408
01:30:48,673 --> 01:30:51,039
Maybe there were small mistakes
made in the male study...

1409
01:30:51,142 --> 01:30:54,111
but we've corrected them
in the female volume.

1410
01:30:55,480 --> 01:30:57,846
This will be a very great book,
Herman.

1411
01:30:57,949 --> 01:31:01,112
- Much better than the first.
- Let's hope so.

1412
01:31:02,988 --> 01:31:06,924
<i>Liberty and license are as far apart...</i>

1413
01:31:07,025 --> 01:31:10,017
<i>As liberty and tyranny.</i>

1414
01:31:10,128 --> 01:31:13,188
<i> Kinsey</i>
<i>is a deranged Nebuchadnezzar...</i>

1415
01:31:13,298 --> 01:31:14,959
<i>leading women out into the fields...</i>

1416
01:31:15,066 --> 01:31:17,398
<i>to mingle with the cattle.</i>

1417
01:31:17,502 --> 01:31:19,834
"Self-appointed messiah
of the sexually despised.

1418
01:31:19,938 --> 01:31:22,839
"Having had his way
with the male of the species...

1419
01:31:22,941 --> 01:31:26,001
Kinsey now insecticizes
American womanhood."

1420
01:31:26,111 --> 01:31:28,011
Did you get any sleep at all
last night?

1421
01:31:28,113 --> 01:31:30,013
How many years do I have to study
human behavior...

1422
01:31:30,115 --> 01:31:32,015
before I'm no longer an entomologist?

1423
01:31:32,117 --> 01:31:37,487
- Why do you read them, Prok?
- I'm trying to find out why
people hate this book so.

1424
01:31:37,589 --> 01:31:40,888
You told them their grandmothers
and their daughters are masturbating...

1425
01:31:40,992 --> 01:31:43,324
having premarital sex,
sex with each other.

1426
01:31:43,428 --> 01:31:46,420
- What did you expect?
- Some respect!

1427
01:31:49,401 --> 01:31:51,301
Don't answer it.

1428
01:31:51,403 --> 01:31:54,566
- Hello.
- Say, Kinsey, what kind of sick man are you?

1429
01:31:54,673 --> 01:31:57,836
Why do you wanna go around poking your nose...

1430
01:32:02,213 --> 01:32:04,181
We're in trouble.

1431
01:32:04,282 --> 01:32:07,718
The cost of film stock is astronomical.

1432
01:32:07,819 --> 01:32:10,379
Shouldn't our nonprofit status
get us a discount?

1433
01:32:10,488 --> 01:32:13,582
Prok, you've got to let some of this go.
We need a full-time accountant.

1434
01:32:13,692 --> 01:32:15,785
What in heavens...

1435
01:32:18,897 --> 01:32:20,797
Stop this!

1436
01:32:20,899 --> 01:32:22,799
Stop it at once! In my office.

1437
01:32:22,901 --> 01:32:25,096
Gebhard, get in there.

1438
01:32:25,203 --> 01:32:27,671
Everyone, back to work.

1439
01:32:29,007 --> 01:32:33,740
Do you have any idea
what a delicate time this is?

1440
01:32:33,845 --> 01:32:35,779
<i>Our enemies are watching</i>
<i>everything we do.</i>

1441
01:32:35,880 --> 01:32:37,780
<i>We can't afford a single slip-up.</i>

1442
01:32:37,882 --> 01:32:40,442
This has nothing to do
with the project.

1443
01:32:40,552 --> 01:32:43,112
- Everything is about the project!
<i>- Oh, it's just a...</i>

1444
01:32:43,221 --> 01:32:45,712
- a misunderstanding.
<i>- No, it's not.!</i>

1445
01:32:45,824 --> 01:32:47,724
<i>You let things get out ofhand</i>
<i>with Martin's wife...</i>

1446
01:32:47,826 --> 01:32:49,726
and now she wants to leave him.

1447
01:32:49,828 --> 01:32:51,955
Isn't that right, Martin?

1448
01:32:54,899 --> 01:32:58,699
And what about you, Gebhard?
Are you planning to leave Agnes and the kids?

1449
01:32:58,803 --> 01:33:01,294
- No, of course not.
- Then end it.

1450
01:33:01,406 --> 01:33:05,502
- I've tried.
- It's not difficult. Just tell her it's over.

1451
01:33:05,610 --> 01:33:10,411
<i>- No explanation necessary.</i>
- All right.

1452
01:33:14,119 --> 01:33:16,952
Clyde, I'm...

1453
01:33:18,523 --> 01:33:20,991
I'm very sorry about all of this.

1454
01:33:27,866 --> 01:33:29,766
I saw this coming.

1455
01:33:29,868 --> 01:33:32,666
Gebhard should have
nipped it in the bud.

1456
01:33:32,771 --> 01:33:35,205
You are so full of shit!

1457
01:33:36,775 --> 01:33:38,970
<i>What are we to you, Prok?</i>
<i>We'rejust lab rats?</i>

1458
01:33:39,077 --> 01:33:42,171
Is this just another part
of the project...

1459
01:33:42,280 --> 01:33:44,180
To prove that sex...

1460
01:33:44,282 --> 01:33:49,413
No. No, I'm sorry.
<i>Fucking</i> is...

1461
01:33:49,521 --> 01:33:54,549
nothing more than...
than friction and harmless fun?

1462
01:33:54,659 --> 01:33:57,992
Well, let me tell you...

1463
01:33:58,096 --> 01:34:01,691
that is a risky game,
because fucking isn't just something.

1464
01:34:01,800 --> 01:34:03,700
It's the whole thing.

1465
01:34:06,204 --> 01:34:08,798
And if you're not careful...

1466
01:34:08,907 --> 01:34:11,239
it will cut you wide open.

1467
01:34:17,115 --> 01:34:20,710
Go home to your wife, Clyde.
She's going to need you.

1468
01:34:39,437 --> 01:34:41,871
I thought the rules were clear.

1469
01:34:41,973 --> 01:34:44,203
No intense romantic entanglements.

1470
01:34:44,309 --> 01:34:46,834
They only make people's lives unstable.

1471
01:34:46,945 --> 01:34:49,914
I guess we all can't be
as disciplined as you, Prok.

1472
01:34:56,754 --> 01:34:57,987
<i>The question of marital infidelity...</i>

1473
01:34:58,022 --> 01:35:00,456
<i>The question of marital infidelity...</i>

1474
01:35:00,558 --> 01:35:05,655
<i>remains one of the most complicated</i>
<i>issues facing our society today.</i>

1475
01:35:07,432 --> 01:35:10,765
<i>Reconciliation</i>
<i>of the married individual's desire...</i>

1476
01:35:10,869 --> 01:35:13,064
for a variety of sexual partners...

1477
01:35:13,171 --> 01:35:15,298
and the maintenance
of a stable marriage...

1478
01:35:15,406 --> 01:35:21,140
presents a problem which has not been
satisfactorily resolved in our culture.

1479
01:35:21,246 --> 01:35:26,843
The fact is, America is awash
in sexual activity...

1480
01:35:26,951 --> 01:35:30,443
- only a small portion of which
is sanctioned by society.

1481
01:35:32,023 --> 01:35:36,426
<i>Sexual morality</i>
<i>needs to be reformed...</i>

1482
01:35:36,528 --> 01:35:38,587
and science will show the way.

1483
01:35:40,865 --> 01:35:44,266
Sometimes...

1484
01:35:48,173 --> 01:35:52,269
I sometimes wonder
what this country would look like if...

1485
01:35:53,645 --> 01:35:55,636
the Puritans had stayed at home.

1486
01:35:55,747 --> 01:35:58,807
<i>What if all the rogues and libertines...</i>

1487
01:35:58,917 --> 01:36:02,045
had crossed the Atlantic instead?

1488
01:36:15,600 --> 01:36:19,092
But the enforcers
of chastity are massing once again...

1489
01:36:19,204 --> 01:36:22,765
to dissuade the scientist,
intimidate him...

1490
01:36:27,545 --> 01:36:30,981
convince him to... cease research.

1491
01:36:32,917 --> 01:36:35,943
For heaven's sake!

1492
01:36:36,054 --> 01:36:38,682
- If you could get him...
- Yes, Mrs. Kinsey.

1493
01:36:38,790 --> 01:36:40,690
Mac.

1494
01:36:46,464 --> 01:36:48,523
He's killing himself.

1495
01:36:48,633 --> 01:36:51,193
And you have to help me stop him.

1496
01:36:51,302 --> 01:36:53,395
- Okay.
- Hmm?

1497
01:37:03,281 --> 01:37:05,249
Hi.

1498
01:37:10,121 --> 01:37:12,589
Doctors say my heart...

1499
01:37:12,690 --> 01:37:15,056
sounds like a cement mixer.

1500
01:37:16,160 --> 01:37:18,060
At least they found one.

1501
01:37:20,398 --> 01:37:25,995
Seems I've developed
a dependency on barbiturates.

1502
01:37:26,104 --> 01:37:28,595
<i>So...</i>

1503
01:37:28,706 --> 01:37:31,436
if I've been a bit harsh lately...

1504
01:37:37,348 --> 01:37:40,545
- How's Alice?
- She's fine.

1505
01:37:42,820 --> 01:37:45,618
We're fine.
You should get some sleep.

1506
01:37:51,896 --> 01:37:55,059
It's always been my biggest fear,
Clyde...

1507
01:37:55,166 --> 01:37:57,566
dying before I finish this work.

1508
01:38:12,417 --> 01:38:16,251
<i>In the course of these hearings</i>
<i>on tax-exempt foundations...</i>

1509
01:38:16,354 --> 01:38:20,654
<i>we intend to show how Communists</i>
<i>are financed in the United States.</i>

1510
01:38:20,758 --> 01:38:24,250
There is a diabolical conspiracy
back of all this...

1511
01:38:24,362 --> 01:38:28,458
<i>and its aim is the furtherance</i>
<i>of socialism in America.</i>

1512
01:38:28,566 --> 01:38:31,967
Do you agree that Kinsey's research...

1513
01:38:32,070 --> 01:38:35,005
aids the communistic aim...

1514
01:38:35,106 --> 01:38:39,236
<i>of weakening and destroying</i>
<i>the youth of our country?</i>

1515
01:38:39,344 --> 01:38:41,938
I do not agree, sir.

1516
01:38:42,046 --> 01:38:45,777
<i>Well, tell me, Dr. Gregg...</i>

1517
01:38:45,883 --> 01:38:48,647
does the Rockefeller Foundation
really believe...

1518
01:38:48,753 --> 01:38:51,745
that it belongs in the business
of sex research?

1519
01:39:07,038 --> 01:39:10,769
I think it's probably something...

1520
01:39:10,875 --> 01:39:14,140
the foundation shouldn't
have anything to do with.

1521
01:39:21,085 --> 01:39:24,384
<i> Dr. Kinsey's project</i>
<i>is now in a position...</i>

1522
01:39:24,489 --> 01:39:27,515
to obtain support from...

1523
01:39:27,625 --> 01:39:30,458
other sources.

1524
01:39:43,007 --> 01:39:46,238
<i> With the loss of support</i>
<i>from the Rockefeller Foundation...</i>

1525
01:39:46,344 --> 01:39:51,646
Dr. Kinsey's project will need
other funding if it is to survive.

1526
01:39:51,749 --> 01:39:55,207
Prok?

1527
01:39:57,989 --> 01:40:00,651
Prok, you home?

1528
01:40:00,758 --> 01:40:04,558
We are running a budget surplus
due to increased enrollment...

1529
01:40:04,662 --> 01:40:09,258
<i>which is a direct result</i>
<i>of Dr. Kinsey's success and fame.</i>

1530
01:40:09,367 --> 01:40:12,768
<i>A small amount of this money...</i>

1531
01:40:12,870 --> 01:40:15,839
<i>would be enough</i>
<i>to keep the project afloat.</i>

1532
01:40:18,743 --> 01:40:20,643
Prok?

1533
01:40:30,888 --> 01:40:35,951
- Prok?
<i>- Why don't we put it to a vote?</i>

1534
01:40:36,060 --> 01:40:38,995
<i>All those in favor</i>
<i>of increasing Dr. Kinsey's grant?</i>

1535
01:41:18,002 --> 01:41:19,902
That's it then.

1536
01:41:23,040 --> 01:41:26,999
This woman was beaten by her father
when she first menstruated.

1537
01:41:28,579 --> 01:41:32,481
<i>Now she's incapable</i>
<i>of physical intimacy of any kind.</i>

1538
01:41:34,785 --> 01:41:38,915
And this man..."Dear Dr. Kinsey...

1539
01:41:39,023 --> 01:41:41,548
<i>"it has taken me</i>
<i>a long time to write to you...</i>

1540
01:41:41,659 --> 01:41:44,787
I suppose because
I was too ashamed and I..."

1541
01:41:44,896 --> 01:41:46,864
Where'd that blood come from?

1542
01:41:48,366 --> 01:41:50,664
I punctured my foreskin.

1543
01:41:51,802 --> 01:41:56,136
<i>I... I wanted to understand different...</i>

1544
01:41:56,240 --> 01:41:58,299
different kinds of sensations.

1545
01:42:01,779 --> 01:42:04,839
It, uh... It didn't give me
any pleasure.

1546
01:42:06,183 --> 01:42:08,151
And there...
And there was only a little...

1547
01:42:11,188 --> 01:42:13,986
pain.

1548
01:42:25,870 --> 01:42:27,997
I couldn't help them, Mac.

1549
01:42:30,107 --> 01:42:32,007
I couldn't figure it out.

1550
01:42:32,109 --> 01:42:34,270
Just stop punishing yourself.

1551
01:42:34,378 --> 01:42:37,438
Now I...
I've ruined it for everyone.

1552
01:43:03,641 --> 01:43:06,974
This is an exercise in futility.

1553
01:43:07,078 --> 01:43:10,172
Huntington Hartford is heir
to the A & P fortune.

1554
01:43:10,281 --> 01:43:12,442
He can solve your financial problems
with the stroke of a pen.

1555
01:43:12,550 --> 01:43:14,745
I won't beg, Mac.

1556
01:43:16,854 --> 01:43:20,915
I won't beg.

1557
01:43:21,025 --> 01:43:24,017
<i>Ohio deplores fellatio but tolerates cunnilingus.</i>

1558
01:43:24,128 --> 01:43:26,096
<i>Whereas in my home state of Indiana...</i>

1559
01:43:26,197 --> 01:43:30,258
<i>all forms of oral sex are illegal,</i>
<i>even within marriage.</i>

1560
01:43:30,368 --> 01:43:35,533
Mmm. The current sex laws are completely
out of touch with the real worid.

1561
01:43:35,640 --> 01:43:37,540
I've had four wives.

1562
01:43:37,642 --> 01:43:39,940
Some people say
that makes me a sex offender.

1563
01:43:40,044 --> 01:43:44,071
Well, Hunt, if you keep interrupting Dr. Kinsey...

1564
01:43:44,181 --> 01:43:46,149
you're going to have to find a fifth.

1565
01:43:46,250 --> 01:43:49,344
Please go on.

1566
01:43:49,453 --> 01:43:53,082
Even now, 43 states will punish
a single act of adulterous intercourse.

1567
01:43:53,190 --> 01:43:56,250
<i>I'm thinking ofbuilding a museum.</i>

1568
01:43:56,360 --> 01:43:59,625
What's your opinion of modern art,
Dr. Kinsey?

1569
01:43:59,730 --> 01:44:03,791
<i>It's not my area of expertise,</i>
<i>Mr. Hartford.</i>

1570
01:44:03,901 --> 01:44:08,838
- I really don't consider myself
qualified to discuss it.
<i>- Well, why not?</i>

1571
01:44:08,939 --> 01:44:11,373
Just because
I own some supermarkets...

1572
01:44:11,475 --> 01:44:14,444
that doesn't mean I'm only capable
of talking about groceries.

1573
01:44:16,914 --> 01:44:21,180
Oh. Do you hate modern art
as much as I do?

1574
01:44:21,285 --> 01:44:24,948
<i>Squiggly lines, empty canvases,</i>
<i>white on white.</i>

1575
01:44:25,056 --> 01:44:28,492
So, the next book will deal
with sex offenders?

1576
01:44:28,592 --> 01:44:30,560
We need money, Mrs. Hartford.

1577
01:44:31,962 --> 01:44:33,862
We...

1578
01:44:35,466 --> 01:44:38,663
We need someone to give us money.

1579
01:44:38,769 --> 01:44:41,829
<i>You have no idea</i>
<i>what I've had to endure...</i>

1580
01:44:41,939 --> 01:44:45,375
just to obtain the same rights
other scientists take for granted.

1581
01:44:45,476 --> 01:44:50,243
My funding has been slashed, and my name
has been dragged through the mud...

1582
01:44:50,347 --> 01:44:53,839
in every newspaper and magazine
across this country.

1583
01:44:55,786 --> 01:44:58,846
Every dollar I've ever earned has...
Leave me alone!

1584
01:45:01,425 --> 01:45:05,486
<i> Every dollar I've ever</i>
<i>made has gone back into the project.</i>

1585
01:45:05,596 --> 01:45:10,465
But fighting this customs case has cost us
an appalling amount. We're broke.

1586
01:45:10,568 --> 01:45:12,798
- Dr. Kinsey...
<i>- Please.</i>

1587
01:45:12,903 --> 01:45:15,463
I'm not even sure
how much time I have left.

1588
01:45:15,573 --> 01:45:18,565
Help me.
I have to get it all on the record.

1589
01:45:18,676 --> 01:45:20,871
Well, I'm very sorry.

1590
01:45:20,978 --> 01:45:26,075
<i>Any support I give might be misconstrued</i>
<i>as an endorsement of sex.</i>

1591
01:45:26,183 --> 01:45:28,549
<i>I can't afford that kind of exposure.</i>

1592
01:45:28,652 --> 01:45:30,552
I see.

1593
01:45:30,654 --> 01:45:33,088
<i>But I'm sure something</i>
<i>will come through.</i>

1594
01:45:50,708 --> 01:45:54,269
You're right.
Rich people have lazy minds.

1595
01:45:54,378 --> 01:45:56,744
Took them five minutes
to find a water glass.

1596
01:45:59,717 --> 01:46:03,175
- I'm taking you to the hospital.
- Mm-mm. Mm-mmm.

1597
01:46:03,287 --> 01:46:05,812
No. No more beds.

1598
01:46:06,957 --> 01:46:10,449
I spent my whole childhood
lying in bed.

1599
01:46:17,268 --> 01:46:20,203
Let's go back to the hotel, Mac.

1600
01:46:20,304 --> 01:46:23,273
I wanna pick up a few histories
in the morning.

1601
01:46:29,346 --> 01:46:32,873
<i> We'd been married for 23 years,</i>
<i>with three marvelous children.</i>

1602
01:46:34,151 --> 01:46:36,915
And as soon as my youngest
left to go to college...

1603
01:46:37,021 --> 01:46:41,424
I took a job in an arts foundation.

1604
01:46:46,597 --> 01:46:48,497
I met a woman there...

1605
01:46:48,599 --> 01:46:51,033
secretary in the grants office.

1606
01:46:56,740 --> 01:46:59,140
We became fast friends, and...

1607
01:47:03,814 --> 01:47:06,112
before long,
I fell in love with her.

1608
01:47:10,287 --> 01:47:15,122
Hmm. This came as quite a shock,
as you might imagine.

1609
01:47:16,393 --> 01:47:18,293
The more I tried to ignore it...

1610
01:47:18,395 --> 01:47:21,489
the more... powerful it became.

1611
01:47:26,604 --> 01:47:28,936
You have no idea...

1612
01:47:29,039 --> 01:47:31,337
what it's like
to have your own thoughts...

1613
01:47:31,442 --> 01:47:34,900
turn against you like that.

1614
01:47:35,012 --> 01:47:37,913
I couldn't talk to anyone
about my situation...

1615
01:47:38,015 --> 01:47:41,109
so I found other ways to cope.

1616
01:47:46,557 --> 01:47:50,220
Uh, I took up drinking.

1617
01:47:51,962 --> 01:47:55,830
Eventually, my husband left me.

1618
01:47:55,933 --> 01:47:58,401
Even my children fell away.

1619
01:48:00,771 --> 01:48:04,468
I came very close to... ending it all.

1620
01:48:09,146 --> 01:48:11,205
It's just another reminder
of how little...

1621
01:48:11,315 --> 01:48:15,183
things have changed in our society.

1622
01:48:15,286 --> 01:48:18,619
What are you talking about?
Things have gotten much better.

1623
01:48:20,524 --> 01:48:22,424
Oh? What happened?

1624
01:48:24,061 --> 01:48:26,029
Why, you did, of course.

1625
01:48:26,130 --> 01:48:29,258
<i>After I read your book, I realized...</i>

1626
01:48:29,366 --> 01:48:33,166
<i>how many other women</i>
<i>were in the same situation.</i>

1627
01:48:33,270 --> 01:48:36,535
I mustered the courage
to talk to my friend...

1628
01:48:36,640 --> 01:48:41,771
and she told me,
to my great surprise...

1629
01:48:41,879 --> 01:48:45,144
that the feelings were mutual.

1630
01:48:45,249 --> 01:48:49,686
We-We've been together
for three happy years now.

1631
01:49:07,972 --> 01:49:09,803
You saved my life, sir.

1632
01:49:19,183 --> 01:49:21,083
<i>Just, uh, one more question.</i>

1633
01:49:21,185 --> 01:49:24,120
<i>You'vejust told me your entire history...</i>

1634
01:49:24,221 --> 01:49:27,088
<i>childhood, family, career...</i>

1635
01:49:27,191 --> 01:49:29,625
<i>every person you've ever had sex with...</i>

1636
01:49:29,727 --> 01:49:32,491
but there hasn't been
a single mention of love.

1637
01:49:32,596 --> 01:49:36,692
That's because it's impossible
to measure love.

1638
01:49:36,800 --> 01:49:39,894
And as you know, without measurements,
there can be no science.

1639
01:49:41,271 --> 01:49:44,263
But I've been thinking a lot
about the problem lately.

1640
01:49:44,375 --> 01:49:46,343
Oh. Problem?

1641
01:49:46,443 --> 01:49:50,140
When it comes to love,
we're all in the dark.

1642
01:49:51,615 --> 01:49:55,574
<i>So, you do think it matters?</i>

1643
01:50:02,960 --> 01:50:04,860
What time's our flight, Mac?

1644
01:50:04,962 --> 01:50:06,862
Not for a couple of hours.

1645
01:50:06,964 --> 01:50:08,864
Let's stop in the woods.

1646
01:51:11,261 --> 01:51:13,229
Mac?

1647
01:51:16,333 --> 01:51:18,494
<i>I'm right here, Prok.</i>

1648
01:51:22,372 --> 01:51:24,806
Just imagine...

1649
01:51:24,908 --> 01:51:27,638
these trees
are over a thousand years old.

1650
01:51:27,744 --> 01:51:31,612
<i>Hence the name:</i>
Sequoia sempervirens...

1651
01:51:31,715 --> 01:51:34,809
always green, always alive.

1652
01:51:41,692 --> 01:51:45,788
Mac, did I ever tell you
about the Mbeere?

1653
01:51:45,896 --> 01:51:49,024
No, not that I recall.

1654
01:51:49,133 --> 01:51:52,261
They're an ancient East African tribe.

1655
01:51:52,369 --> 01:51:55,634
They believe that trees
are imperfect men...

1656
01:51:55,739 --> 01:51:58,264
<i>eternally bemoaning</i>
<i>their imprisonment...</i>

1657
01:51:58,375 --> 01:52:01,105
<i>the roots that keep them</i>
<i>stuck in one place.</i>

1658
01:52:05,282 --> 01:52:09,184
But I've never seen
a discontented tree.

1659
01:52:09,286 --> 01:52:13,154
Look at this one... the way its roots
are gripping the ground.

1660
01:52:14,892 --> 01:52:17,861
I believe it really loves it.

1661
01:52:26,870 --> 01:52:28,838
Come on, Mac.

1662
01:52:31,441 --> 01:52:33,341
What's the hurry?

1663
01:52:33,443 --> 01:52:35,343
There's a lot of work to do.
