They say many things about Paris.

1260
01:45:40,900 --> 01:45:44,734
They say it is where
artists find inspiration.

1261
01:45:45,271 --> 01:45:47,603
They say it is where people go

1262
01:45:47,773 --> 01:45:51,140
to find something new
in their lives.

1263
01:45:51,477 --> 01:45:54,742
They say it is where
you can find love.

1264
01:45:59,051 --> 01:46:01,110
Of course at my age

1265
01:46:01,287 --> 01:46:04,688
I didn't expect anything like that.

1266
01:46:06,559 --> 01:46:11,121
However, during those days,
I had many thoughts about my life.

1267
01:46:11,297 --> 01:46:14,289
I thought

1268
01:46:14,467 --> 01:46:17,334

1271
01:46:21,807 --> 01:46:25,004

I am sure they are very nice.

1275
01:46:35,087 --> 01:46:37,055
I visited a famous cemetery

1276
01:46:37,223 --> 01:46:40,488
where many famous people
are buried.

1277
01:46:41,160 --> 01:46:45,062
I saw the grave of Jean-Paul Sartre
and Simón BolÍvar.

1278
01:46:46,566 --> 01:46:50,525
My book says they were
two famous French writers

1279
01:46:50,736 --> 01:46:52,567
who loved each other very much

1280
01:46:52,738 --> 01:46:55,798
and that's why
they are buried together.

1281
01:46:57,410 --> 01:47:01,403
And I saw the tomb of a man
named Porfirio DÍaz.

1282
01:47:02,081 --> 01:47:07,519
My book says he was
dictator of Mexico for 35 years.

1283
01:47:07,687 --> 01:47:11,817
It was interesting
to be next to such a powerful man

1284
01:47:11,991 --> 01:47:16,121
who cannot move or talk
anymore like I can.

1285
01:47:17,997 --> 01:47:22,024
I thought about my sister Patty,
who died very young,

1286
01:47:22,201 --> 01:47:27,229
and about my mother,
who died of cancer last year.

1287
01:47:29,408 --> 01:47:33,037
One day I will be buried too

1288
01:47:33,212 --> 01:47:35,908
and maybe no one will visit me.

1289
01:47:36,315 --> 01:47:39,182
But I won't care. I'll be dead.

01:47:43,923 --> 01:47:46,323
But I am not a sad person.

1291

It's just that sometimes

1295
01:47:56,535 --> 01:47:59,368
I wish I had someone

1296
01:47:59,538 --> 01:48:01,802
to share things with.

1297
01:48:02,575 --> 01:48:03,564
For example,

1298
01:48:03,743 --> 01:48:06,337
when I saw all of Paris
from a skyscraper,

1299
01:48:06,512 --> 01:48:10,107
I wanted to say to someone,
"Isn't that beautiful?"

1300
01:48:10,282 --> 01:48:12,648
But there was nobody there.

1301
01:48:13,586 --> 01:48:16,180
I thought about
my ex-boyfriend Dave,

1302
01:48:16,355 --> 01:48:19,324
if he would have enjoyed this trip,

1303
01:48:19,492 --> 01:48:22,256
but then I felt a little stupid

1304
01:48:22,428 --> 01:48:27,161
because we've not spoken
for 11 years

1305
01:48:27,333 --> 01:48:31,292

with three children.

1306
01:48:34,140 --> 01:48:37,576
Then I found a lovely little park.

1307
01:48:40,112 --> 01:48:42,137
I sat down in the park

1308
01:48:42,314 --> 01:48:46,114
and ate a sandwich that I'd bought.

1309
01:48:46,886 --> 01:48:48,751
It tasted very good.

1310
01:48:49,188 --> 01:48:51,884
