1
00:00:24,899 --> 00:00:27,776
(steady acoustic guitar music)

2
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,086
- # It was in your
basement apartment #

3
00:00:46,212 --> 00:00:50,674
# with all of its earth
and sea #

4
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:55,554
# making love on the carpet #

5
00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:00,350
# under the light of the TV #

6
00:01:00,477 --> 00:01:04,563
# Outside the sour moon
minstrels #

7
00:01:04,689 --> 00:01:08,734
# shook their dark tambourines #

8
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:14,239
# the morning came in sinister #

9
00:01:14,365 --> 00:01:18,285
# well window light menacing #

10
00:01:18,411 --> 00:01:23,749
# with clouds up above #

11
00:01:23,875 --> 00:01:27,127
# and clouds down below #

12
00:01:27,253 --> 00:01:33,300
# killing time
but it won't stand still #

13
00:01:33,426 --> 00:01:36,303
# It won't stand still #

14
00:01:44,854 --> 00:01:46,438
- Mike!

15
00:01:47,315 --> 00:01:51,318
Mike, need you
to sweep the pool.

16
00:01:53,113 --> 00:01:54,530
- Why?

17
00:01:54,656 --> 00:01:56,115
- Because people want to swim.

18
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:09,002
# We try so hard #

19
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:13,423
# We try so hard to love #

20
00:02:15,009 --> 00:02:16,718
- How you feel today, Ma?

21
00:02:16,845 --> 00:02:17,845
- Feeling great today, Mike.

22
00:02:17,971 --> 00:02:18,971
- Good.

23
00:02:20,473 --> 00:02:21,431
Where's Dad?

24
00:02:21,558 --> 00:02:23,517
- Crossword.

25
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:28,856
- Checking out of 202.

26
00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:30,858
- And how was your stay,
Mr. Edmund?

27
00:02:30,984 --> 00:02:31,942
- Fine, thanks.

28
00:02:32,068 --> 00:02:33,735
- Thank you so much.

29
00:02:33,862 --> 00:02:38,157
- # I threw my heart
into the street #

30
00:02:38,283 --> 00:02:43,203
# With stars up above #

31
00:02:43,329 --> 00:02:46,665
# And stars down below #

32
00:02:46,791 --> 00:02:52,796
# Killing time
but it won't stand still #

33
00:02:52,922 --> 00:02:55,924
# It won't stand still #

34
00:02:56,050 --> 00:03:04,808
# We try so hard #

35
00:03:04,934 --> 00:03:09,354
# We try so hard to love #

36
00:03:16,571 --> 00:03:18,322
- So, two nights.
- Uh-huh.

37
00:03:18,448 --> 00:03:23,076
- Preferably a room upstairs.
- Oh, sure.

38
00:03:23,203 --> 00:03:24,661
Let's see...

39
00:03:24,787 --> 00:03:27,289
- Smoking or-
- Nonsmoking.

40
00:03:27,415 --> 00:03:29,082
- I think I'll put you
in 203.

41
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:30,167
- Okay.

42
00:03:30,293 --> 00:03:31,627
- Nice room.

43
00:03:31,753 --> 00:03:32,753
This is our snack bar.

44
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:35,005
List of prices
are on the wall.

45
00:03:40,887 --> 00:03:42,554
- Sorry.

46
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:43,639
- There you go.

47
00:03:43,765 --> 00:03:45,474
Thank you.

48
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:46,683
And if-

49
00:03:46,809 --> 00:03:49,770
Uh-huh, thank you.

50
00:03:49,896 --> 00:03:51,980
Anything else you need,
just give me a call.

51
00:03:52,106 --> 00:03:53,315
- Thank you very much.

52
00:03:53,441 --> 00:03:55,484
- You need help
with your bags?

53
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:57,903
- Nope, I'm fine.

54
00:03:58,029 --> 00:04:01,031
(truck horn blows)

55
00:04:02,867 --> 00:04:04,493
- 110's called twice
to complain

56
00:04:04,619 --> 00:04:06,453
that 111's
making too much noise.

57
00:04:06,579 --> 00:04:08,330
- Yeah, what kind of noise?

58
00:04:08,456 --> 00:04:09,623
- Not that kind of noise,
Michael.

59
00:04:09,749 --> 00:04:12,125
Get your mind
out of the gutter.

60
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:15,462
Apparently 111's got some sort
of grinder in there.

61
00:04:15,588 --> 00:04:17,381
- I thought you said to get
my mind out of the gutter.

62
00:04:17,507 --> 00:04:18,548
- Don't be gross, Mike.

63
00:04:18,675 --> 00:04:20,634
- I'm not.

64
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,636
- Get some sleep.
You look tired.

65
00:04:22,762 --> 00:04:24,638
- I'm not tired.
- You look tired.

66
00:04:24,764 --> 00:04:27,349
- You're the one
who's sick, Ma.

67
00:04:27,475 --> 00:04:29,309
- Well, that's a nice thing
to say.

68
00:04:29,435 --> 00:04:30,978
- Sorry.

69
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:32,980
- Love you.
- Love you too.

70
00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:34,898
- Good night, Dad.

71
00:04:35,024 --> 00:04:37,526
- All right.

72
00:05:36,085 --> 00:05:37,294
(knocks on door)

73
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:38,420
- Who is it?

74
00:05:38,546 --> 00:05:41,131
- Management.

75
00:05:41,257 --> 00:05:42,215
- What?

76
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:45,427
- Management, welcome gift.

77
00:05:53,978 --> 00:05:55,645
- Hi.
- Hi.

78
00:05:55,772 --> 00:06:00,734
- I have your complimentary
bottle-welcome gift.

79
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:03,737
Wine, it's on the house.

80
00:06:04,781 --> 00:06:08,325
I'm, oh, Mike,
and I am with management.

81
00:06:08,451 --> 00:06:10,327
- Nice to meet you, Mike.

82
00:06:10,453 --> 00:06:12,037
- Oh, it's my pleasure.

83
00:06:13,915 --> 00:06:14,915
So where would you like it?

84
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:17,876
- You know what?
I can just-I can just take it.

85
00:06:18,002 --> 00:06:20,796
- Oh, okay.

86
00:06:20,922 --> 00:06:21,880
Do you-

87
00:06:22,006 --> 00:06:25,425
I'm sorry; would you like me
to open it for you?

88
00:06:25,551 --> 00:06:28,845
I mean, yeah, 'cause sometimes
guests don't have the screws,

89
00:06:28,971 --> 00:06:29,971
corkscrews.

90
00:06:31,307 --> 00:06:34,476
- Um...

91
00:06:34,602 --> 00:06:35,852
Yeah, okay, sure.

92
00:06:35,978 --> 00:06:38,021
Sure.

93
00:06:38,147 --> 00:06:41,817
I'll just put this here.

94
00:06:41,943 --> 00:06:43,652
All right, thanks.

95
00:06:51,119 --> 00:06:54,037
See anything
interesting tonight?

96
00:06:54,163 --> 00:06:57,165
- I haven't really been
paying attention.

97
00:06:57,291 --> 00:06:59,167
- Yeah, I know the feeling.

98
00:07:01,295 --> 00:07:05,006
You know, there should be cups
in the bathroom.

99
00:07:21,566 --> 00:07:24,651
Completely sanitary.

100
00:07:24,777 --> 00:07:27,571
- That's good.

101
00:07:35,872 --> 00:07:38,373
- Wine is delicious.

102
00:07:38,499 --> 00:07:40,250
Oh, man.

103
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:45,422
God.

104
00:07:47,842 --> 00:07:50,093
Shall I?

105
00:07:50,219 --> 00:07:53,054
- Okay, sure.

106
00:08:05,902 --> 00:08:07,903
- This is a good year.

107
00:08:08,029 --> 00:08:12,324
Sometimes guests invite me
to join them in a taste.

108
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:13,450
- Is that right?

109
00:08:13,576 --> 00:08:17,329
- I mean, not always,
but often.

110
00:08:17,455 --> 00:08:18,538
Should be another cup
in the-

111
00:08:18,664 --> 00:08:21,500
- I actually have to get
to work, Mike, so...

112
00:08:21,626 --> 00:08:22,709
- What do you do?

113
00:08:22,835 --> 00:08:23,835
- I sell paintings.

114
00:08:23,961 --> 00:08:26,588
- Really?
I love paintings.

115
00:08:26,756 --> 00:08:27,714
What kind?

116
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:32,052
- That kind.

117
00:08:32,178 --> 00:08:33,845
- Oh.

118
00:08:33,971 --> 00:08:35,222
Oh, nice.

119
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:36,556
So that's what you're doing
in town.

120
00:08:36,682 --> 00:08:37,807
- I have presentations tomorrow,

121
00:08:37,934 --> 00:08:39,184
and then I fly out
the next morning.

122
00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:41,603
- What's the name of the company
that you work for?

123
00:08:41,729 --> 00:08:43,647
- It's called Corporate Bliss.

124
00:08:43,773 --> 00:08:45,482
- And where are you guys HQ'd?

125
00:08:45,608 --> 00:08:48,235
- Maryland.
- Nice.

126
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:52,781
Wait, "Maryland is for lovers,"
bumper sticker.

127
00:08:52,907 --> 00:08:54,157
- That's Virginia, actually.

128
00:08:54,283 --> 00:08:55,825
Virginia's for lovers.

129
00:08:55,952 --> 00:08:56,993
Maryland's for crabs.

130
00:08:57,119 --> 00:08:59,204
- Yeah, you're right.
- Okay, Mike.

131
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:00,539
- Okay, I got to get back
to work.

132
00:09:00,665 --> 00:09:03,375
Oh, Solitaire's a great game.

133
00:09:03,501 --> 00:09:05,418
Okay, I'm gonna down
in the lobby till 11:00

134
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:08,838
and then in my apartment
after that,

135
00:09:08,965 --> 00:09:10,632
but always reachable
by front-door buzzer,

136
00:09:10,758 --> 00:09:12,300
just from then on.

137
00:09:12,426 --> 00:09:14,219
Just in case you need
another Solitaire partner.

138
00:09:14,345 --> 00:09:16,513
- Okay, have a great night.
- Bye-bye.

139
00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:41,413
- Then I went
to the laundry room,

140
00:09:41,539 --> 00:09:43,164
and then I came down here
into the lobby,

141
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:44,541
and that's when I realized

142
00:09:44,667 --> 00:09:48,211
that your establishment doesn't
have any options for recycling.

143
00:09:48,337 --> 00:09:49,588
- You're absolutely right.

144
00:09:49,714 --> 00:09:51,548
We don't,
which I apologize for.

145
00:09:51,674 --> 00:09:53,800
It's something
we're working on.

146
00:09:53,926 --> 00:09:54,968
But as you may know,

147
00:09:55,094 --> 00:09:56,803
the Kingman area
has been a little slow

148
00:09:56,929 --> 00:09:59,889
to fully embrace
the recycling issue.

149
00:10:00,016 --> 00:10:01,433
It's been voted on
two or three-

150
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:03,226
- So what should I do
with this bottle?

151
00:10:03,352 --> 00:10:05,729
- Well...

152
00:10:05,855 --> 00:10:06,980
- I'm sorry, I don't mean
to be rude.

153
00:10:07,106 --> 00:10:08,857
But this is something
that I'm just-

154
00:10:08,983 --> 00:10:10,191
I'm very passionate about.

155
00:10:10,318 --> 00:10:11,276
- Recycling?

156
00:10:11,402 --> 00:10:12,444
- Yes, recycling.

157
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:14,654
- I can take it.
I'll do it.

158
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:16,573
I've just-I'll-

159
00:10:16,699 --> 00:10:20,785
I was gonna make
a recycling run anyway, so...

160
00:10:20,911 --> 00:10:22,704
- Well, that's nice of you.

161
00:10:23,873 --> 00:10:25,874
This is my son Michael.

162
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,126
He's the official
night manager.

163
00:10:30,046 --> 00:10:31,671
- Thank you.

164
00:10:31,797 --> 00:10:33,423
That's very nice of you.

165
00:10:33,549 --> 00:10:35,800
- You bet.

166
00:10:35,926 --> 00:10:38,678
I'll just put it back here
with all my other ones.

167
00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:42,641
I got a pretty good-
big pile going.

168
00:11:04,705 --> 00:11:06,039
(knocks on door)

169
00:11:06,165 --> 00:11:07,123
- Who is it?

170
00:11:07,249 --> 00:11:08,500
- It's Mike.

171
00:11:08,626 --> 00:11:10,585
- Oh, my God.

172
00:11:14,173 --> 00:11:15,548
- Champagne.

173
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:17,008
- Why?

174
00:11:17,134 --> 00:11:20,845
- We give it to all our guests
who stay for two nights.

175
00:11:20,971 --> 00:11:24,307
- Wow, that's
a pretty good deal.

176
00:11:24,433 --> 00:11:26,559
Did you and your mom come up
with that on your own?

177
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:31,648
- So shall I?

178
00:11:31,774 --> 00:11:35,443
- Why not?

179
00:11:37,988 --> 00:11:40,740
- Observe well.

180
00:11:40,866 --> 00:11:41,825
You know the drill.

181
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:45,120
The same place,
the cups.

182
00:12:08,853 --> 00:12:09,853
(cork pops)

183
00:12:09,979 --> 00:12:12,063
Ooh!
- Jeez.

184
00:12:34,795 --> 00:12:36,588
Thank you.

185
00:12:36,714 --> 00:12:38,256
- You gonna make a toast, Mike?

186
00:12:40,301 --> 00:12:41,885
- Yeah, sure.

187
00:12:42,011 --> 00:12:43,386
Your Sue, right?

188
00:12:43,512 --> 00:12:44,554
- Yeah.

189
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:49,559
- Here's to people being happy.

190
00:12:56,442 --> 00:12:57,442
Mm.

191
00:12:59,236 --> 00:13:00,236
- Ooh.

192
00:13:00,362 --> 00:13:03,782
- How were
your presentations today?

193
00:13:06,744 --> 00:13:07,744
- Average.

194
00:13:15,044 --> 00:13:16,461
- You have a great butt.

195
00:13:18,964 --> 00:13:21,966
I noticed the moment
you checked in.

196
00:13:24,762 --> 00:13:25,762
- Thank you.

197
00:13:25,888 --> 00:13:27,388
- I hope that isn't too,
you know.

198
00:13:27,515 --> 00:13:30,850
- No, I mean, yeah, but-

199
00:13:30,976 --> 00:13:33,394
- Thank you for that.

200
00:13:33,521 --> 00:13:35,563
- Do you do this a lot, Mike?

201
00:13:35,689 --> 00:13:36,731
- No.

202
00:13:36,857 --> 00:13:37,857
- Sometimes?

203
00:13:37,983 --> 00:13:39,359
- Very rarely.

204
00:13:39,485 --> 00:13:40,652
- Does it ever work?

205
00:13:40,778 --> 00:13:43,029
- Never.

206
00:13:43,155 --> 00:13:46,199
- What would constitute
having it work?

207
00:13:46,325 --> 00:13:48,618
- I don't-

208
00:13:48,744 --> 00:13:49,953
- Us having sex?

209
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:51,538
- No, I don't-

210
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:54,874
- You getting to touch my butt?

211
00:13:56,794 --> 00:13:59,128
- That would-

212
00:13:59,255 --> 00:14:04,342
Yeah, I'd consider that...

213
00:14:04,468 --> 00:14:07,303
for the con-constitution.

214
00:14:07,429 --> 00:14:12,809
- Hmm.

215
00:14:12,935 --> 00:14:16,187
Okay.

216
00:14:16,313 --> 00:14:18,857
You can touch my butt...

217
00:14:18,983 --> 00:14:20,567
but then you got to go.

218
00:14:36,333 --> 00:14:37,333
Okay.

219
00:14:38,377 --> 00:14:39,794
- Are you serious?

220
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:43,464
- Yeah, touch it and go, Mike,
just touch and go.

221
00:15:08,365 --> 00:15:10,241
- So you're from Maryland?
- Yeah.

222
00:15:10,367 --> 00:15:11,326
- Where about?

223
00:15:11,452 --> 00:15:13,036
- Columbia, what about you?

224
00:15:13,162 --> 00:15:17,248
- Here, Kingman.

225
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:21,252
It's very warm.

226
00:15:23,547 --> 00:15:24,505
- Okay, Mike.
- Okay.

227
00:15:24,632 --> 00:15:26,049
- I got a early plane
to catch tomorrow.

228
00:15:26,175 --> 00:15:27,216
- Yeah, me too.

229
00:15:27,343 --> 00:15:28,718
- Okay.
- Bye-bye now.

230
00:15:28,844 --> 00:15:30,386
- Yep, bye.

231
00:16:01,418 --> 00:16:02,418
- Mom?

232
00:16:02,544 --> 00:16:03,503
Hi, it's me.

233
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:05,171
I'm just checking in.

234
00:16:05,297 --> 00:16:10,259
I'm in Kingman, Arizona.

235
00:16:10,386 --> 00:16:11,552
Okay, well, that's it.

236
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:14,222
I-I love you, and-
and I miss you.

237
00:16:14,348 --> 00:16:17,642
Okay.

238
00:16:45,295 --> 00:16:46,671
- Hi, Sue.

239
00:16:46,797 --> 00:16:47,797
- Hi.

240
00:16:51,051 --> 00:16:55,513
- I was wondering if I could
snag your cell phone number

241
00:16:55,639 --> 00:16:58,182
or your email
before you left.

242
00:16:58,308 --> 00:17:01,185
- I don't think so, Mike.

243
00:17:01,311 --> 00:17:02,729
- Why not?

244
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:05,314
- Not my style.

245
00:17:05,441 --> 00:17:08,026
- But we-

246
00:17:08,152 --> 00:17:11,112
you know,
I touched your butt.

247
00:17:11,238 --> 00:17:15,742
- I know, and it was nice.

248
00:17:15,868 --> 00:17:18,327
I just think
that's all she wrote.

249
00:18:42,579 --> 00:18:43,579
That was-

250
00:19:01,431 --> 00:19:02,807
- Mike, are those high-tops?

251
00:19:02,933 --> 00:19:03,933
- Yeah.

252
00:19:04,059 --> 00:19:05,643
- You're never gonna
get those off.

253
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:14,110
- Oh!

254
00:19:14,236 --> 00:19:15,486
Keep it-
don't-under me.

255
00:19:42,431 --> 00:19:46,350
- Hi.
- Hi.

256
00:19:46,476 --> 00:19:47,435
- You all checked out?

257
00:19:47,561 --> 00:19:52,440
- Yeah, I did it
with your wife earlier.

258
00:19:56,069 --> 00:19:57,236
- Shoot.

259
00:20:01,241 --> 00:20:02,241
- Hey, Dad.

260
00:20:02,367 --> 00:20:04,785
Oh, come back
and see us sometime.

261
00:20:04,912 --> 00:20:08,789
- Mm-hmm, yeah, well, you know,
it all depends on work.

262
00:20:30,354 --> 00:20:32,230
- What was that all about?

263
00:20:32,356 --> 00:20:36,776
- She sells motel paintings.

264
00:20:45,535 --> 00:20:48,913
- Mike, heat's out in 118.

265
00:20:50,332 --> 00:20:53,834
- # Well, I've never
been to Spain #

266
00:20:55,963 --> 00:21:01,384
# But I kind of like the music #

267
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:06,806
# They say the ladies
are insane there#

268
00:21:06,932 --> 00:21:13,271
# And they sure
know how to use it #

269
00:21:13,397 --> 00:21:16,524
# They don't abuse it #

270
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:17,692
# Don't go and lose it #

271
00:21:19,444 --> 00:21:20,903
- Thank you for calling
last minute-

272
00:21:21,029 --> 00:21:21,988
- I'd like to book a-

273
00:21:22,114 --> 00:21:23,447
- Your call is important to us.
- Fuck!

274
00:21:23,573 --> 00:21:27,994
- # Well, I've never been
to England #

275
00:21:29,913 --> 00:21:31,622
- Please continue to hold.

276
00:21:31,748 --> 00:21:32,832
Your call will be answered

277
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:34,292
in the order
in which it was received.

278
00:21:34,418 --> 00:21:37,128
- Come on, Mike,
now or never.

279
00:21:37,254 --> 00:21:38,254
I'm gonna do it!

280
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:40,047
- Hello, Last Minute Flights.

281
00:21:40,173 --> 00:21:41,799
How may I assist you?

282
00:21:41,925 --> 00:21:45,511
- Hi, yeah, I'd like to book
a one-way cash ticket

283
00:21:45,637 --> 00:21:50,474
for as fast as possible from
Phoenix to Baltimore, got it?

284
00:21:56,064 --> 00:22:01,652
- # Well, I've never been
to heaven #

285
00:22:01,778 --> 00:22:06,657
# But I've been to Oklahoma #

286
00:22:06,783 --> 00:22:12,455
# Well, they tell me
I was born there #

287
00:22:12,581 --> 00:22:18,461
# But I really don't remember #

288
00:22:18,587 --> 00:22:24,216
# In Oklahoma,
not Arizona #

289
00:22:24,343 --> 00:22:29,430
# What does it matter? #

290
00:22:38,982 --> 00:22:39,940
- Hi.
- Hi.

291
00:22:40,067 --> 00:22:41,484
- I'm here to see Sue Claussen.

292
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:42,943
- Mm-hmm,
is she expecting you?

293
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:45,321
- Yeah, I left a couple
messages.

294
00:22:45,447 --> 00:22:47,156
- Messages regarding?

295
00:22:47,282 --> 00:22:50,159
- Regarding Sue,
telling her I was in town.

296
00:22:50,285 --> 00:22:51,369
I'm an old friend.

297
00:22:51,495 --> 00:22:53,496
- I see.

298
00:22:53,622 --> 00:22:55,206
Okay.

299
00:23:02,214 --> 00:23:05,049
- Sue, hi.

300
00:23:07,511 --> 00:23:08,511
- What are you doing here?

301
00:23:08,637 --> 00:23:11,514
- I-I was wondering
if we could talk.

302
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:12,890
- Why are you here?

303
00:23:13,016 --> 00:23:14,892
- I called twice.

304
00:23:15,018 --> 00:23:16,811
Did you get the messages?

305
00:23:16,937 --> 00:23:18,771
- You know what, you guys?
I'm sorry.

306
00:23:18,897 --> 00:23:20,022
Why don't you-
you go on ahead.

307
00:23:20,148 --> 00:23:21,190
- Are you sure, Sue?

308
00:23:21,316 --> 00:23:23,317
- Yeah, no, good, go.

309
00:23:23,443 --> 00:23:25,403
Good.

310
00:23:25,529 --> 00:23:27,113
- Hi.

311
00:23:30,158 --> 00:23:31,617
- Can I talk to you
for a second?

312
00:23:31,743 --> 00:23:33,327
- Yeah.

313
00:23:34,704 --> 00:23:37,748
- This is completely
inappropriate.

314
00:23:37,874 --> 00:23:39,125
This is like a violation.

315
00:23:39,251 --> 00:23:40,709
- I wasn't trying to violate-

316
00:23:40,836 --> 00:23:42,711
- Well, you did.
You are.

317
00:23:42,838 --> 00:23:44,713
You are violating
my personal space.

318
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:46,799
You are violating
my personal life.

319
00:23:46,925 --> 00:23:48,259
I can't do this.
I have to be somewhere.

320
00:23:48,385 --> 00:23:49,343
I'm late.

321
00:23:49,469 --> 00:23:50,970
- It's-it's 5:00.

322
00:23:51,096 --> 00:23:52,096
What could you be
late for?

323
00:23:52,222 --> 00:23:53,347
- I have an event.

324
00:23:53,473 --> 00:23:55,182
- You have an event?

325
00:23:55,308 --> 00:23:56,350
What kind of an event?

326
00:23:56,476 --> 00:23:58,477
- I'm not gonna tell you.

327
00:23:58,603 --> 00:24:00,896
- Can I come?

328
00:24:38,768 --> 00:24:40,144
Here.

329
00:24:40,270 --> 00:24:43,355
Come on, you need it.

330
00:24:43,482 --> 00:24:45,608
You do this every week?

331
00:24:45,734 --> 00:24:46,859
- Yeah.

332
00:24:46,985 --> 00:24:48,611
- You're really good.

333
00:24:53,450 --> 00:24:54,909
- You can't stay, Mike.

334
00:24:55,035 --> 00:24:56,202
- Why not?

335
00:24:56,328 --> 00:24:58,829
- 'Cause it's insane.

336
00:24:58,955 --> 00:24:59,914
I let you touch my butt,

337
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:02,708
and then you fly all the way
across the country.

338
00:25:02,834 --> 00:25:05,544
- Well, it was much more
than a butt touch.

339
00:25:10,050 --> 00:25:11,050
- Still, you can't stay.

340
00:25:11,176 --> 00:25:13,594
I got a lot I got to do.

341
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:15,346
- Well, how much stuff
can you do in one night?

342
00:25:15,472 --> 00:25:17,139
- A lot.

343
00:25:17,265 --> 00:25:19,600
- Like what?

344
00:25:19,726 --> 00:25:21,393
Do you go out with friends?

345
00:25:24,105 --> 00:25:26,607
- Do you see that girl
over there?

346
00:25:26,733 --> 00:25:28,359
She works
for Burger King.

347
00:25:28,485 --> 00:25:30,569
She gives me vouchers
every week.

348
00:25:30,695 --> 00:25:32,571
And I pass them out.

349
00:25:32,697 --> 00:25:34,240
That's what I do.

350
00:25:41,414 --> 00:25:43,749
- Hey.

351
00:25:43,875 --> 00:25:46,460
I just want
to let you know,

352
00:25:46,586 --> 00:25:49,004
if you want me
to leave tomorrow, I will.

353
00:25:49,130 --> 00:25:51,257
I promise.

354
00:25:52,884 --> 00:25:54,093
- Hey, guys.

355
00:25:54,219 --> 00:25:56,929
- Sue's here.

356
00:25:57,055 --> 00:25:58,013
- Okay.

357
00:25:58,139 --> 00:25:59,348
Whopper.

358
00:25:59,474 --> 00:26:01,308
- Yeah, sure, yeah.

359
00:26:01,434 --> 00:26:02,601
- Whopper.

360
00:26:02,727 --> 00:26:04,144
Whopper.

361
00:26:04,271 --> 00:26:06,814
Whopper, Whopper.

362
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:08,941
Okay, chicken tenders.

363
00:26:09,067 --> 00:26:10,734
Chicken tender.

364
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:14,822
Be careful,
easy, easy, easy, easy.

365
00:26:14,948 --> 00:26:16,574
There you go, chicken tender.

366
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:21,662
Okay, BB-BK veggie burger.

367
00:26:21,788 --> 00:26:23,998
- Fuck that, Sue.

368
00:26:24,124 --> 00:26:26,083
- Come on, it's supposed
to be delicious.

369
00:26:26,209 --> 00:26:27,167
- I don't think so.

370
00:26:27,294 --> 00:26:28,377
- Come on, guys,
it's got soy in it.

371
00:26:28,503 --> 00:26:30,921
It's really-
it's really good.

372
00:26:31,047 --> 00:26:33,132
- Fine, I'll take one.

373
00:26:33,383 --> 00:26:34,341
- All right.

374
00:26:34,467 --> 00:26:35,467
Hey, who wants a Powerade?

375
00:26:35,594 --> 00:26:36,552
- I do
- I do.

376
00:26:36,678 --> 00:26:37,678
- All right.

377
00:26:37,804 --> 00:26:39,972
Got one there, buddy?

378
00:26:42,851 --> 00:26:43,851
Oh, this is nice.

379
00:26:43,977 --> 00:26:45,894
- Thanks, I've been here
two years.

380
00:26:52,319 --> 00:26:54,028
Compact fluorescents.

381
00:26:54,154 --> 00:26:55,946
- Oh, bummer.

382
00:26:56,072 --> 00:27:00,534
- No, that's-

383
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:02,870
So I think I'm gonna
go to sleep.

384
00:27:02,996 --> 00:27:05,748
- Do you want me
to touch your butt first?

385
00:27:07,792 --> 00:27:11,670
- No, I only do that
when I'm traveling.

386
00:27:12,922 --> 00:27:16,967
- Right.

387
00:27:17,093 --> 00:27:20,220
So do you-are you alone
here in Maryland,

388
00:27:20,347 --> 00:27:22,097
or do you have relatives around?

389
00:27:22,223 --> 00:27:24,600
- My mom is over in Laurel.

390
00:27:24,726 --> 00:27:25,726
That-

391
00:27:25,852 --> 00:27:27,061
Her name's Mary.

392
00:27:27,187 --> 00:27:29,605
- Oh, what does she do?

393
00:27:29,731 --> 00:27:32,483
- She sells insurance
to deaf people.

394
00:27:32,609 --> 00:27:35,778
- Oh, nice sweat suit.

395
00:27:35,904 --> 00:27:39,490
- (chuckles)

396
00:27:39,616 --> 00:27:42,785
I don't-you know, I don't want
you to take this the wrong way,

397
00:27:42,911 --> 00:27:47,122
but I think we probably
shouldn't sleep in the same bed.

398
00:27:47,248 --> 00:27:48,248
- That's a good call.

399
00:29:03,908 --> 00:29:06,952
- So is your return ticket
all set?

400
00:29:08,747 --> 00:29:10,205
- I actually don't have one.

401
00:29:10,331 --> 00:29:12,791
- You don't have
a return ticket?

402
00:29:12,917 --> 00:29:14,209
- No, I bought a one-way.

403
00:29:14,335 --> 00:29:16,086
- Why?
- Um...

404
00:29:16,212 --> 00:29:17,796
- That's completely
unacceptable, Mike.

405
00:29:17,922 --> 00:29:18,881
- I know.

406
00:29:19,007 --> 00:29:20,007
- You need to buy one.

407
00:29:20,133 --> 00:29:21,425
- I know.
I'm sorry.

408
00:29:21,551 --> 00:29:23,469
I-I didn't have
enough money.

409
00:29:23,595 --> 00:29:24,678
- What?

410
00:29:24,804 --> 00:29:27,139
- I only had enough
for a one-way,

411
00:29:27,265 --> 00:29:31,393
and I thought-I thought,
"I'm just gonna go for it."

412
00:29:31,519 --> 00:29:34,480
- With me?
- Yes.

413
00:29:34,606 --> 00:29:35,898
It was
a far-flung notion.

414
00:29:36,024 --> 00:29:38,025
- It was a fucking
stupid notion.

415
00:29:38,151 --> 00:29:39,276
- I guess.

416
00:29:39,402 --> 00:29:41,153
- I'll lend you the money.

417
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:43,155
- No, you don't have to do that.
- Well, I'm going to.

418
00:29:43,281 --> 00:29:46,074
- Okay, hey,
would you first consider

419
00:29:46,201 --> 00:29:47,910
taking the morning off
from work?

420
00:29:48,036 --> 00:29:49,161
- No.

421
00:29:49,287 --> 00:29:51,205
- We could hang out,
and then I'll leave.

422
00:29:51,331 --> 00:29:53,791
If I don't, you can mace me.

423
00:29:53,917 --> 00:29:55,417
- You're insane.

424
00:29:55,543 --> 00:29:56,543
- We could go to the zoo.

425
00:29:56,669 --> 00:29:57,628
That'd be fun.

426
00:29:57,754 --> 00:30:00,130
- Mike, zoos suck.

427
00:30:00,256 --> 00:30:02,090
- Okay, then we'll
do something else.

428
00:30:02,217 --> 00:30:03,926
Come on, Sue,
take the day off from work.

429
00:30:04,052 --> 00:30:05,469
You look like you could use it.

430
00:30:08,139 --> 00:30:09,807
- I do?

431
00:30:09,933 --> 00:30:11,725
- No, hey!

432
00:30:18,107 --> 00:30:20,317
(voices overlapping)

433
00:30:20,443 --> 00:30:22,486
- Bump something!

434
00:30:22,612 --> 00:30:23,987
Bump those people.

435
00:30:24,113 --> 00:30:25,447
Wait, wait, wait.

436
00:30:25,573 --> 00:30:26,782
Give it to me.

437
00:30:26,908 --> 00:30:28,784
- Not too hard, okay?

438
00:30:28,910 --> 00:30:30,828
All right.

439
00:30:30,954 --> 00:30:32,037
Oh, man.

440
00:30:36,835 --> 00:30:38,919
- You shouldn't smoke.

441
00:30:39,045 --> 00:30:40,712
- I'm done forever.
I'm serious.

442
00:30:40,839 --> 00:30:43,131
- No, you don't-
hey, you don't have to-

443
00:30:43,258 --> 00:30:44,216
You didn't have to do that.

444
00:30:44,342 --> 00:30:45,300
- I know, but I am.

445
00:30:45,426 --> 00:30:47,219
I'm done.

446
00:30:47,345 --> 00:30:50,138
It's time.

447
00:30:50,265 --> 00:30:52,266
- Let me see
if I understand something.

448
00:30:52,392 --> 00:30:54,852
Do you think that you, like,
like me, Mike?

449
00:30:54,978 --> 00:30:56,562
- Yes.

450
00:30:56,688 --> 00:30:58,564
- Why?

451
00:30:58,690 --> 00:31:00,941
- 'Cause you have style.

452
00:31:01,067 --> 00:31:02,276
- No, I don't.
- Yeah, you do.

453
00:31:02,402 --> 00:31:03,777
- No, no, I don't.

454
00:31:03,903 --> 00:31:05,404
- Yeah.

455
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:09,658
You-you give away 30%
of your income.

456
00:31:09,784 --> 00:31:12,619
- You would too
if you made more.

457
00:31:12,745 --> 00:31:14,955
- No, I wouldn't.

458
00:31:15,081 --> 00:31:20,794
You're also
incredibly sweet.

459
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:23,505
Well, beneath, you know.

460
00:31:26,009 --> 00:31:28,844
- Beneath what?

461
00:31:28,970 --> 00:31:32,139
- Beneath the part of you
that's not.

462
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:39,146
- You better catch your bus.

463
00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:47,029
- I'll pay you back
for the ticket.

464
00:31:47,155 --> 00:31:51,575
- Don't worry about it.

465
00:31:51,701 --> 00:31:54,786
- So will I ever
see you again?

466
00:31:54,913 --> 00:31:56,496
- I wouldn't be
good for you, Mike.

467
00:31:56,623 --> 00:31:57,581
I'm not good with people.

468
00:31:57,707 --> 00:31:58,790
- No, that's not true.

469
00:31:58,917 --> 00:32:00,167
- Yeah, no, it is.

470
00:32:00,293 --> 00:32:01,960
- No, it's not.

471
00:32:02,086 --> 00:32:03,629
What about
those homeless guys?

472
00:32:03,755 --> 00:32:06,548
They love you.

473
00:32:06,674 --> 00:32:12,054
What about the soccer gals?

474
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:14,723
What about me?

475
00:32:31,908 --> 00:32:33,200
- Okay, buddy,
all aboard.

476
00:32:36,454 --> 00:32:39,831
- I think, Mike,
you'd better get on the bus.

477
00:33:26,921 --> 00:33:29,464
- Hey, Sue,
it's Mike calling again.

478
00:33:29,590 --> 00:33:30,632
I'm trying not to call too much,

479
00:33:30,758 --> 00:33:33,301
but I just want to make sure
that you got the poem

480
00:33:33,428 --> 00:33:34,553
that I sent last week,

481
00:33:34,679 --> 00:33:38,015
you know, the sort of elongated
haiku thing.

482
00:33:38,141 --> 00:33:42,227
Anyway, you know my home number
and of course the front desk.

483
00:33:42,353 --> 00:33:43,478
But seriously, you should call,

484
00:33:43,604 --> 00:33:45,856
because I'm-
I'm definitely around.

485
00:33:45,982 --> 00:33:47,774
Anyway, talk to you later,
I hope.

486
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:49,234
Bye.

487
00:33:55,950 --> 00:33:57,659
- # More than begin #

488
00:33:57,785 --> 00:33:59,578
# but less than forget #

489
00:33:59,704 --> 00:34:01,496
# But spirits born #

490
00:34:01,622 --> 00:34:03,999
# from the not happened yet #

491
00:34:04,125 --> 00:34:06,001
# gathering there #

492
00:34:06,127 --> 00:34:07,461
# to pay off a debt #

493
00:34:07,587 --> 00:34:10,005
# brought back from the wars #

494
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:24,770
# We thought we lost you #

495
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:27,230
# Welcome back #

496
00:34:36,741 --> 00:34:38,658
- I thought you were gonna
quit smoking.

497
00:34:44,874 --> 00:34:46,083
- I just did.

498
00:34:50,588 --> 00:34:52,089
What are you doing here?

499
00:34:53,466 --> 00:34:54,508
- Work.

500
00:34:57,136 --> 00:34:59,679
- Hey, did-did you get
my haiku?

501
00:34:59,806 --> 00:35:02,099
- The elongated one?

502
00:35:02,225 --> 00:35:08,105
- Yeah.

503
00:35:08,231 --> 00:35:09,481
It was nice.

504
00:35:12,026 --> 00:35:14,528
- So you're just
passing through?

505
00:35:14,654 --> 00:35:16,029
- Yeah.

506
00:35:16,155 --> 00:35:18,198
I fly out
from Phoenix tomorrow.

507
00:35:18,324 --> 00:35:19,574
- Oh, okay.

508
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:22,077
- I'll take that.
- Oh, thank you.

509
00:35:22,203 --> 00:35:24,996
- So this must be a really,
you know,

510
00:35:25,123 --> 00:35:27,624
good region
for corporate art sales.

511
00:35:28,709 --> 00:35:30,335
- Yes, it is.

512
00:35:30,461 --> 00:35:31,461
- Good.

513
00:35:34,549 --> 00:35:39,803
Hey, I'm supposed to go to this
yoga class thing later.

514
00:35:39,929 --> 00:35:42,430
Would you like
to come with me?

515
00:36:05,079 --> 00:36:06,329
Do you have
a boyfriend, Sue?

516
00:36:06,455 --> 00:36:07,914
- No.

517
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:10,000
- Did you recently?

518
00:36:11,502 --> 00:36:12,460
- Yes.

519
00:36:12,587 --> 00:36:14,462
- What was his name?

520
00:36:14,589 --> 00:36:17,883
- Jango.

521
00:36:18,009 --> 00:36:19,092
He's an ex-punk.

522
00:36:19,218 --> 00:36:21,011
- Ex-like, an ex-punk?

523
00:36:21,137 --> 00:36:23,680
- Ex-rock punk.

524
00:36:23,806 --> 00:36:26,141
We broke up
when he moved away.

525
00:36:26,267 --> 00:36:28,393
- Why'd he leave?

526
00:36:28,519 --> 00:36:30,437
- To open
the Pacific Northwest branch

527
00:36:30,563 --> 00:36:33,398
of his organic
yogurt company.

528
00:36:33,524 --> 00:36:34,482
He's the president.

529
00:36:34,609 --> 00:36:35,609
- There you go.

530
00:36:35,735 --> 00:36:38,320
- Thank you.

531
00:36:38,446 --> 00:36:40,530
- Thanks.

532
00:36:40,656 --> 00:36:42,699
So how's your job
these days?

533
00:36:42,825 --> 00:36:43,992
- It's okay.

534
00:36:44,118 --> 00:36:46,494
- But it's not
your fantasyjob.

535
00:36:46,621 --> 00:36:48,747
- I don't really
do fantasy, Mike.

536
00:36:48,873 --> 00:36:50,624
- If you could close your eyes
and pick anything,

537
00:36:50,750 --> 00:36:51,750
what would it be?

538
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:53,960
- Uh...

539
00:36:54,086 --> 00:36:55,128
- But you got to close
your eyes.

540
00:36:55,254 --> 00:36:56,254
Otherwise,
it's not gonna work.

541
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:57,589
- Oh, okay.

542
00:36:57,715 --> 00:37:02,052
Okay.

543
00:37:02,178 --> 00:37:05,013
To run a full-service,
state-of-the-art soup kitchen.

544
00:37:05,139 --> 00:37:06,223
- Wow.

545
00:37:06,349 --> 00:37:08,892
- Multiple housing
units upstairs,

546
00:37:09,018 --> 00:37:12,354
recreational facilities
in the basement,

547
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:14,898
job outreach,
midnight basketball.

548
00:37:15,024 --> 00:37:16,650
- Really good soup?
- Always.

549
00:37:16,776 --> 00:37:19,569
Excellent soup,
first and foremost.

550
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:22,030
- What about kids?

551
00:37:22,156 --> 00:37:23,281
You want to have kids?

552
00:37:25,034 --> 00:37:26,117
- You know what
was really great

553
00:37:26,244 --> 00:37:29,454
about that yoga class?

554
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:33,500
It was the breathing stuff.

555
00:37:33,626 --> 00:37:35,043
I don't do that.

556
00:37:35,169 --> 00:37:36,253
- Breathe?

557
00:37:36,379 --> 00:37:40,507
- There are days where
I have to instruct my heart

558
00:37:40,633 --> 00:37:45,637
to request additional air.

559
00:37:45,763 --> 00:37:49,266
And I have to tell myself,

560
00:37:49,392 --> 00:37:50,850
"Breathe, Sue.

561
00:37:50,977 --> 00:37:53,853
Just keep breathing."

562
00:37:56,107 --> 00:37:58,024
Yes, I want kids.

563
00:37:58,150 --> 00:38:00,402
- Were you not sure
when I asked?

564
00:38:03,447 --> 00:38:06,700
- I just don't think
I've ever really been asked...

565
00:38:06,826 --> 00:38:09,369
that way...

566
00:38:09,495 --> 00:38:11,705
before.

567
00:38:12,707 --> 00:38:14,374
- Can I ask
one more question?

568
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:16,418
And then I'm done,
I swear.

569
00:38:16,544 --> 00:38:17,711
- What?

570
00:38:20,214 --> 00:38:22,507
- Will you come visit my mom
with me on the way home?

571
00:38:22,633 --> 00:38:24,843
She's sick, and I-

572
00:38:24,969 --> 00:38:28,388
I promised I'd stop by.

573
00:38:28,514 --> 00:38:30,807
- Here, these are for you.

574
00:38:30,933 --> 00:38:33,476
There's a flower
show downtown.

575
00:38:33,602 --> 00:38:37,772
- That's nice of you.

576
00:38:37,898 --> 00:38:42,319
- Um, hey, Ma, Sue flew in from
Baltimore just this morning.

577
00:38:42,445 --> 00:38:44,154
- What do you do, Sue?

578
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:48,616
- I sell corporate
decorative art.

579
00:38:48,743 --> 00:38:49,951
- I've met you before.

580
00:38:50,077 --> 00:38:52,287
- Yeah, you know,
she stayed at the motel, Ma.

581
00:38:52,413 --> 00:38:53,371
That's how we met.

582
00:38:53,497 --> 00:38:55,123
- And where are you
from originally?

583
00:38:55,249 --> 00:38:57,792
- I'm from Columbia, Maryland.

584
00:38:57,918 --> 00:38:59,753
- Do you come
from a good family?

585
00:38:59,879 --> 00:39:02,339
- Uh...

586
00:39:02,465 --> 00:39:04,007
No, not really.

587
00:39:04,133 --> 00:39:06,760
- Is there something
specifically wrong

588
00:39:06,886 --> 00:39:09,095
with your family?

589
00:39:09,221 --> 00:39:11,264
- Well, my father lives
on an ashram

590
00:39:11,390 --> 00:39:13,475
in Northern California.

591
00:39:13,601 --> 00:39:18,938
Pretty much sums up
everything about him.

592
00:39:19,065 --> 00:39:20,899
He once forgot to pick me up
from gymnastics

593
00:39:21,025 --> 00:39:22,817
for an entire night.

594
00:39:22,943 --> 00:39:24,319
- That's quite a lot
of somersaults.

595
00:39:24,445 --> 00:39:27,197
- (laughs)

596
00:39:27,323 --> 00:39:28,698
- I didn't care.

597
00:39:28,824 --> 00:39:31,117
It reallyjust explains
more about him

598
00:39:31,243 --> 00:39:34,579
than it does me.

599
00:39:34,705 --> 00:39:37,082
- (coughs)

600
00:39:37,208 --> 00:39:39,793
Could you hand me
those pills, Mike?

601
00:39:39,919 --> 00:39:40,877
- Which ones?

602
00:39:41,003 --> 00:39:44,255
- The ones on the left there.

603
00:39:50,971 --> 00:39:53,640
Can I talk to my son in private
for a moment?

604
00:39:55,017 --> 00:39:56,684
- Yeah, I-
Did I say something wrong?

605
00:39:56,811 --> 00:39:58,561
- Not at all.

606
00:39:59,647 --> 00:40:01,022
- I'll just be a moment.

607
00:40:03,317 --> 00:40:04,484
- Okay.

608
00:40:11,826 --> 00:40:12,867
- I like her.

609
00:40:12,993 --> 00:40:15,161
- Really?

610
00:40:15,287 --> 00:40:19,040
- She's a bit
of a long shot.

611
00:40:19,166 --> 00:40:20,458
But she's logical

612
00:40:20,584 --> 00:40:24,254
in an emotionally annihilated
kind of way.

613
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:26,339
But that's okay.

614
00:40:26,465 --> 00:40:29,551
Underneath,
there's a heart of-

615
00:40:29,677 --> 00:40:30,677
- Gold?

616
00:40:30,803 --> 00:40:32,053
- No, I wouldn't say gold.

617
00:40:32,179 --> 00:40:34,097
Maybe made of...

618
00:40:34,223 --> 00:40:35,682
leather.

619
00:40:37,852 --> 00:40:40,770
But if it works out,

620
00:40:40,896 --> 00:40:42,397
she'll be good for you
when I'm gone.

621
00:40:42,523 --> 00:40:44,899
Needless to say,
what would make me happy

622
00:40:45,025 --> 00:40:48,403
is for you to find something
for yourself

623
00:40:48,529 --> 00:40:49,821
before my checkout time,

624
00:40:49,947 --> 00:40:52,449
just so I know it's not

625
00:40:52,575 --> 00:40:56,619
you and your father alone here,
walking around like robots.

626
00:40:56,745 --> 00:40:58,663
- Ma, Dad's not a robot.

627
00:40:58,789 --> 00:41:00,165
- He is.

628
00:41:00,291 --> 00:41:05,587
But I was mostly talking
about you...

629
00:41:05,713 --> 00:41:08,214
unless you find
a way out.

630
00:41:08,340 --> 00:41:09,299
- Of what?

631
00:41:09,425 --> 00:41:12,135
- Of whatever it is
you're stuck in.

632
00:41:15,806 --> 00:41:18,683
You get it from your father.

633
00:41:18,809 --> 00:41:22,395
He came back
from the war stuck.

634
00:41:22,521 --> 00:41:25,356
Been talking about
joining a gym ever since.

635
00:41:27,401 --> 00:41:29,277
Never has.

636
00:41:29,403 --> 00:41:34,616
But that doesn't
have to be you.

637
00:41:43,751 --> 00:41:45,084
- You okay?

638
00:41:45,211 --> 00:41:47,337
- Yeah, are you?

639
00:41:47,463 --> 00:41:50,632
- Yeah.

640
00:41:50,758 --> 00:41:52,634
- She liked you.

641
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:53,760
- No, she didn't.

642
00:41:53,886 --> 00:41:55,553
- Yeah, she did.

643
00:41:55,679 --> 00:41:58,223
She told me.

644
00:42:12,154 --> 00:42:14,280
- What took you so long?

645
00:42:17,618 --> 00:42:20,203
- Dad, do you remember Sue?

646
00:42:21,622 --> 00:42:23,414
- Hi.

647
00:42:23,541 --> 00:42:25,542
There's a toilet overflowing
in 110.

648
00:42:25,668 --> 00:42:27,794
- Okay.

649
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:30,088
- Got to get home to your mom.

650
00:43:07,418 --> 00:43:08,668
- You really leaving?

651
00:43:08,794 --> 00:43:10,295
- I have to.

652
00:43:10,421 --> 00:43:12,880
- You can't do one more night?

653
00:43:13,007 --> 00:43:15,174
- I have meetings
this afternoon in Seattle.

654
00:43:15,301 --> 00:43:17,844
- Blow 'em off
and just stay for a while.

655
00:43:17,970 --> 00:43:19,262
- It's myjob.

656
00:43:19,388 --> 00:43:20,388
- I know.

657
00:43:20,514 --> 00:43:22,599
But, you know, you could get
a job around here.

658
00:43:22,725 --> 00:43:24,559
- Where, Szechuan House?

659
00:43:24,685 --> 00:43:27,228
- No.

660
00:43:27,354 --> 00:43:28,438
I'm just saying that,
you know-

661
00:43:28,564 --> 00:43:32,525
- Mike.

662
00:43:32,651 --> 00:43:37,488
I don't know
how to say this.

663
00:43:37,615 --> 00:43:40,575
This isn't gonna work.

664
00:43:40,701 --> 00:43:44,203
I mean, I'll-I'll stop by
when I pass through.

665
00:43:44,330 --> 00:43:45,705
- Come on,
what do you mean?

666
00:43:48,125 --> 00:43:50,668
- I can't move from Baltimore

667
00:43:50,794 --> 00:43:52,420
to live in
a corner double room

668
00:43:52,546 --> 00:43:54,672
of your parents' motel.

669
00:43:57,635 --> 00:44:01,679
I mean...

670
00:44:01,805 --> 00:44:03,806
be serious.

671
00:44:07,311 --> 00:44:10,271
I'm sorry.

672
00:44:10,397 --> 00:44:13,024
I'll stay in better touch
this time.

673
00:44:13,150 --> 00:44:16,027
- Yeah, whatever you say.

674
00:44:50,896 --> 00:44:53,690
So this is where she wanted?

675
00:44:53,816 --> 00:44:58,236
- Well, this used to be
all scrub.

676
00:44:58,362 --> 00:44:59,487
She'd be cringing right now

677
00:44:59,613 --> 00:45:02,448
if she knew
they were building here.

678
00:45:02,574 --> 00:45:07,453
But I promised her
I'd do it.

679
00:45:12,501 --> 00:45:15,795
- Yeah, it's still nice.

680
00:45:18,257 --> 00:45:20,967
- I meant to give this
to you earlier.

681
00:45:21,093 --> 00:45:24,011
It's your mom's favorite
piece ofjewelry.

682
00:45:24,138 --> 00:45:25,722
As you know,
she was a necklace woman.

683
00:45:25,848 --> 00:45:28,433
She thought
you should have it.

684
00:45:28,559 --> 00:45:29,684
Don't know why.

685
00:45:29,810 --> 00:45:32,061
Wouldn't want you
to start wearing it,

686
00:45:32,187 --> 00:45:36,649
but maybe you can find
some use for it, something.

687
00:45:36,775 --> 00:45:37,775
- Thanks, Dad.

688
00:45:37,901 --> 00:45:41,487
- Also had some guy call me,

689
00:45:41,613 --> 00:45:43,030
wanted to buy the motel.

690
00:45:44,992 --> 00:45:46,451
- You gonna do it?

691
00:45:46,577 --> 00:45:47,535
- I doubt it.

692
00:45:47,661 --> 00:45:50,621
May as well keep
running it.

693
00:45:50,748 --> 00:45:51,956
But you can do
what you want, Mike,

694
00:45:52,082 --> 00:45:53,166
you know, if you-

695
00:45:53,292 --> 00:45:56,169
you want to leave.

696
00:47:23,090 --> 00:47:25,341
- This ain't a half bad
hunk ofjunk.

697
00:47:25,467 --> 00:47:26,592
- Yeah, it was my mother's.

698
00:47:26,718 --> 00:47:29,637
- Oh, God, let's not go down
the sentimental road.

699
00:47:29,763 --> 00:47:30,930
- Oh, I'm not.
I'm just saying.

700
00:47:31,056 --> 00:47:32,223
- Yeah, I know
what you're saying,

701
00:47:32,349 --> 00:47:33,683
and I know
you're gonna start crying.

702
00:47:33,809 --> 00:47:34,976
- What?
No, I'm not.

703
00:47:35,102 --> 00:47:37,603
- How long you been
in the pawn business?

704
00:47:37,729 --> 00:47:39,021
- The porn business?

705
00:47:39,147 --> 00:47:40,815
- No, the pawn business,
God damn it.

706
00:47:40,941 --> 00:47:43,109
How long you been
in the pawn business?

707
00:47:43,235 --> 00:47:45,903
- Oh, no, I'm never-
I'm not in that.

708
00:47:46,029 --> 00:47:47,280
- No, no, exactly.

709
00:47:47,406 --> 00:47:49,574
So when somebody says
they ain't gonna start crying,

710
00:47:49,700 --> 00:47:51,826
that's sure as shit sign

711
00:47:51,952 --> 00:47:54,787
that they's just about
to start blubbering like a calf.

712
00:48:01,295 --> 00:48:03,504
Oh, see what I mean?

713
00:48:03,630 --> 00:48:06,841
- Just, how much
for the necklace?

714
00:48:10,554 --> 00:48:11,846
- I'll give you $300.

715
00:48:13,807 --> 00:48:14,807
- Okay.

716
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:22,398
- Oh.

717
00:48:22,524 --> 00:48:24,525
- Hi.
- Hi.

718
00:48:24,651 --> 00:48:26,152
- I'm here to see Sue, please.

719
00:48:26,278 --> 00:48:28,195
- Sue no longer works here.

720
00:48:28,322 --> 00:48:29,947
- I'm sorry?

721
00:48:30,073 --> 00:48:32,158
- She moved to Washington.

722
00:48:32,284 --> 00:48:33,784
- D.C.?

723
00:48:33,911 --> 00:48:35,620
- State.

724
00:48:36,997 --> 00:48:39,040
Her old boyfriend convinced her
to move out to Aberdeen,

725
00:48:39,166 --> 00:48:40,917
showed up here with flowers,
first class plane tickets.

726
00:48:41,043 --> 00:48:43,461
It was very
Officer and a Gentleman.

727
00:48:57,017 --> 00:48:58,893
- (screams)

728
00:48:59,019 --> 00:49:00,061
Fuck!

729
00:49:39,226 --> 00:49:42,228
- (speaking foreign language)

730
00:49:46,066 --> 00:49:47,066
- Number eight?

731
00:49:47,192 --> 00:49:48,609
- (speaking foreign language)

732
00:49:48,735 --> 00:49:49,777
- Eight?

733
00:49:49,903 --> 00:49:52,905
- (speaking foreign language)

734
00:49:54,408 --> 00:49:57,284
Dude, I'm just messing with you.

735
00:49:57,411 --> 00:49:58,411
You're new in town, right?

736
00:49:58,537 --> 00:50:00,746
- Oh, yeah.

737
00:50:02,749 --> 00:50:04,417
- You looking for a job?

738
00:50:05,794 --> 00:50:08,129
- Yeah.

739
00:50:08,255 --> 00:50:12,133
- You, uh...

740
00:50:12,259 --> 00:50:14,176
you want to work here?

741
00:50:15,345 --> 00:50:16,303
- Seriously?

742
00:50:16,430 --> 00:50:18,305
- Why the fuck
wouldn't I be serious?

743
00:50:20,392 --> 00:50:22,268
- Al.
- I'm Mike.

744
00:50:22,394 --> 00:50:23,477
- Mike, it is nice
to meet you, Mike.

745
00:50:23,603 --> 00:50:24,603
- Yeah, you too.

746
00:50:24,730 --> 00:50:25,813
- Dude, you stink.

747
00:50:25,939 --> 00:50:27,648
- I do?
- Big time.

748
00:50:27,774 --> 00:50:29,358
You can't work here
if you stink.

749
00:50:29,484 --> 00:50:31,277
It's my parents' place,
and they're old school.

750
00:50:31,403 --> 00:50:32,486
They really hate stinky people.

751
00:50:32,612 --> 00:50:33,863
- Okay.

752
00:50:33,989 --> 00:50:37,033
- Yeah, so, like, go home,
take a shower, please,

753
00:50:37,159 --> 00:50:39,160
come back,
and I will get you the job.

754
00:50:40,996 --> 00:50:43,414
- I don't have a home.

755
00:50:43,540 --> 00:50:45,583
- Really?

756
00:50:45,709 --> 00:50:48,002
- He also needs
a place to live.

757
00:50:48,128 --> 00:50:50,504
So I was thinking
that maybe we could, you know,

758
00:50:50,630 --> 00:50:51,881
let him stay in the basement

759
00:50:52,007 --> 00:50:54,050
and deduct some rent
from his pay.

760
00:50:55,302 --> 00:50:59,889
- (speaking foreign language)

761
00:51:01,475 --> 00:51:03,642
- Great.

762
00:51:06,730 --> 00:51:08,022
- Hey, thanks a lot
for helping me out.

763
00:51:08,148 --> 00:51:10,608
It really means a lot.

764
00:51:10,734 --> 00:51:12,693
- Dude, no problem, man.

765
00:51:12,819 --> 00:51:14,278
You know, I've been trying
to get my folks

766
00:51:14,404 --> 00:51:15,571
to hire someone American anyway,

767
00:51:15,697 --> 00:51:17,490
'cause we catch less
bigot bullshit that way.

768
00:51:17,616 --> 00:51:19,533
Plus, I freakin' hate
working the mornings.

769
00:51:19,659 --> 00:51:21,160
- Why?

770
00:51:21,286 --> 00:51:23,120
- 'Cause I smoke a lot of pot,
and I like sleeping in.

771
00:51:23,246 --> 00:51:25,122
- That's cool.

772
00:51:25,248 --> 00:51:27,500
- So why'd you come
to Aberdeen, Mike?

773
00:51:27,626 --> 00:51:30,711
- This girl
that I'm in love with,

774
00:51:30,837 --> 00:51:33,297
she moved here
to be with her ex-boyfriend.

775
00:51:35,634 --> 00:51:37,843
- Oh, that sucks, man.

776
00:51:37,969 --> 00:51:41,472
- Yeah, especially considering
the guy's a punk.

777
00:51:41,598 --> 00:51:43,808
- Like, a punk punk?

778
00:51:43,934 --> 00:51:45,059
- Ex-punk.

779
00:51:45,185 --> 00:51:46,268
I think he's older now.

780
00:51:49,439 --> 00:51:50,397
- Does he train dogs?

781
00:51:50,524 --> 00:51:51,649
- I don't know.

782
00:51:51,775 --> 00:51:53,943
- Is his name, like, Jango?

783
00:51:54,069 --> 00:51:57,154
- Jang-yeah, I think it is.

784
00:51:57,656 --> 00:51:59,073
- I have totally
heard of this dude, Mike.

785
00:51:59,199 --> 00:52:01,909
- Is he a punk?
- No, he's an ex-punk.

786
00:52:03,578 --> 00:52:04,787
- So the thing
with this guy is, right?

787
00:52:04,913 --> 00:52:06,831
He's also, like,
a yogurt magnate.

788
00:52:06,957 --> 00:52:08,541
Okay, totally huge
in the yogurt business.

789
00:52:08,667 --> 00:52:10,918
This guy's, like,
a yogurt fucking mogul.

790
00:52:11,044 --> 00:52:13,087
You see those kennels
over there?

791
00:52:13,213 --> 00:52:15,840
That's where he
keeps the dogs.

792
00:52:15,966 --> 00:52:17,758
- Damn it.
- What?

793
00:52:17,884 --> 00:52:18,884
- This guy-

794
00:52:19,010 --> 00:52:20,761
this guy is, like,
a total stud.

795
00:52:20,887 --> 00:52:21,887
- What do you mean?

796
00:52:22,013 --> 00:52:25,141
- I'm not a sexual superman.

797
00:52:25,267 --> 00:52:26,600
This guy?

798
00:52:26,726 --> 00:52:27,685
I mean...

799
00:52:27,811 --> 00:52:29,562
- No, dude,
you're probably fine.

800
00:52:29,688 --> 00:52:30,646
- You're just saying that.

801
00:52:30,772 --> 00:52:32,439
- Yeah, that's true,
but what do you want me to say,

802
00:52:32,566 --> 00:52:33,566
that you're right?

803
00:52:33,692 --> 00:52:34,650
- No, but-

804
00:52:34,776 --> 00:52:35,776
- Okay, look, look,

805
00:52:35,902 --> 00:52:37,945
chicks these days,
they don't want sexual supermen.

806
00:52:38,071 --> 00:52:41,740
Okay, they want hard workers,
you know, guys who hustle.

807
00:52:41,867 --> 00:52:43,200
And I mean, you look like
a hustler, Mike.

808
00:52:44,578 --> 00:52:46,370
I mean, you came all the way out
to Aberdeen, dude,

809
00:52:46,496 --> 00:52:48,164
and that's got to count
for something, right?

810
00:52:48,290 --> 00:52:50,541
Yeah.
- Yeah.

811
00:52:50,667 --> 00:52:53,085
- This guy's got shrubbery
shaped like pit bulls.

812
00:52:59,426 --> 00:53:02,428
(dogs barking)

813
00:53:33,501 --> 00:53:34,960
Dude, I think I got an idea

814
00:53:35,086 --> 00:53:36,962
for how you can
get your girl back.

815
00:53:37,088 --> 00:53:38,047
- Really?

816
00:53:38,173 --> 00:53:40,007
- See that dude
sitting over there?

817
00:53:40,133 --> 00:53:43,219
He runs a flight school
in Olympia.

818
00:53:43,345 --> 00:53:45,512
You should
talk to him, Mike.

819
00:53:51,686 --> 00:53:52,853
- Okay, Mike.

820
00:53:52,979 --> 00:53:56,023
What I need now is for you
to free your mind

821
00:53:56,149 --> 00:53:58,734
so as to have
a spiritually fulfilling,

822
00:53:58,860 --> 00:54:00,903
religious fucking moment.

823
00:54:01,029 --> 00:54:03,530
- I'm pretty sure
I can do it, Stan.

824
00:54:03,657 --> 00:54:05,574
- That's the Michael
I've come to know

825
00:54:05,700 --> 00:54:07,451
over the last
eight hours.

826
00:54:07,577 --> 00:54:08,577
That's the Mike.

827
00:54:11,331 --> 00:54:13,165
Come on, now.

828
00:54:22,467 --> 00:54:24,802
Three, two, one.

829
00:54:24,928 --> 00:54:26,178
- Wait, one sec!

830
00:54:26,304 --> 00:54:29,306
(screams)

831
00:54:34,062 --> 00:54:35,729
- Yeah.

832
00:54:38,108 --> 00:54:39,566
(Stan)
Okay, now, Mike.

833
00:54:39,693 --> 00:54:42,027
You're on your own!

834
00:54:54,165 --> 00:54:56,792
- (screaming)

835
00:54:56,918 --> 00:54:58,627
Whoo!

836
00:54:58,753 --> 00:55:01,046
(screaming)

837
00:55:08,638 --> 00:55:11,640
(Mike screaming)

838
00:55:12,434 --> 00:55:13,434
- Jesus!

839
00:55:13,560 --> 00:55:14,601
Oh, my God!

840
00:55:14,728 --> 00:55:18,939
Jango!

841
00:55:19,065 --> 00:55:20,399
Oh, my God.

842
00:55:20,525 --> 00:55:21,775
Who is-who is that?

843
00:55:21,901 --> 00:55:23,444
- Sue, it's me, Mike.

844
00:55:24,404 --> 00:55:25,446
- Mike?

845
00:55:25,572 --> 00:55:26,822
- Sue!

846
00:55:26,948 --> 00:55:28,115
- What are you doing?

847
00:55:28,241 --> 00:55:29,491
Mike, come here.

848
00:55:29,617 --> 00:55:31,285
(silenced gunshots)

849
00:55:31,411 --> 00:55:32,369
Jango, stop with the BBs!

850
00:55:32,495 --> 00:55:33,495
I know him.

851
00:55:33,621 --> 00:55:35,664
- What the fuck's going on?

852
00:55:35,790 --> 00:55:37,666
- Come here.
Mike, come here.

853
00:55:37,792 --> 00:55:38,917
Jango, stop shooting people.

854
00:55:39,044 --> 00:55:40,002
Stop it.

855
00:55:40,128 --> 00:55:41,128
Come here to me.
Follow my hands.

856
00:55:41,254 --> 00:55:42,254
Follow the noise.

857
00:55:42,380 --> 00:55:44,006
(gunshots)
Stop it!

858
00:55:44,132 --> 00:55:45,215
Come on.

859
00:55:45,342 --> 00:55:46,675
There you go.
Here I am.

860
00:55:46,801 --> 00:55:48,969
I got you.
I got you.

861
00:55:49,095 --> 00:55:50,304
Why?

862
00:55:50,430 --> 00:55:52,139
Oh, my God,
are you okay?

863
00:55:52,265 --> 00:55:53,265
- Back away.

864
00:55:53,391 --> 00:55:54,350
Sue.

865
00:55:54,476 --> 00:55:55,476
- Jango, give me the gun.

866
00:55:55,602 --> 00:55:56,560
Give me the damn gun.

867
00:55:56,686 --> 00:55:58,312
- I think I'm dying.
- It's just BBs.

868
00:55:58,438 --> 00:56:00,230
- No, I mean,
I really think I'm dying.

869
00:56:00,357 --> 00:56:01,732
- Move back, Sue.

870
00:56:01,858 --> 00:56:03,692
Clear.
- Ow!

871
00:56:03,818 --> 00:56:04,818
- Jango!

872
00:56:04,944 --> 00:56:06,737
What are you doing?
- CPR!

873
00:56:06,863 --> 00:56:09,156
- Oh, my God,
I'm calling an ambulance.

874
00:56:09,282 --> 00:56:10,699
Okay.

875
00:56:10,825 --> 00:56:13,327
Well, that just looks like
you're kissing him, Jango.

876
00:56:28,468 --> 00:56:34,390
- Hi.

877
00:56:34,516 --> 00:56:36,433
- Where am I?

878
00:56:36,559 --> 00:56:38,018
- The Aberdeen Medical Center.

879
00:56:38,144 --> 00:56:41,146
(slurping)

880
00:56:41,773 --> 00:56:43,774
- Did-did-

881
00:56:43,900 --> 00:56:45,567
- Yeah, Jango shot you,

882
00:56:45,693 --> 00:56:49,154
which caused you
to go into shock.

883
00:56:50,615 --> 00:56:54,326
Mike, why?

884
00:56:54,452 --> 00:56:57,913
Why did you come out here?

885
00:56:58,039 --> 00:57:00,666
- Because I love you.

886
00:57:05,296 --> 00:57:07,756
Do I have BB holes
in my neck?

887
00:57:07,882 --> 00:57:08,882
- Yeah.

888
00:57:09,008 --> 00:57:10,676
- They hurt.
- I can imagine.

889
00:57:13,304 --> 00:57:15,222
- I thought it was over
with that guy.

890
00:57:15,348 --> 00:57:17,933
- He's good to me, Mike.

891
00:57:18,059 --> 00:57:21,270
He put me in charge of his
company's nonprofit yogurt fund,

892
00:57:21,396 --> 00:57:24,606
which allows me to do a lot of
good things for a lot of people.

893
00:57:24,732 --> 00:57:26,942
He also feels horrible
about shooting you,

894
00:57:27,068 --> 00:57:30,612
and he would like
to have you over for dinner.

895
00:57:30,738 --> 00:57:33,365
- Oh, that's nice.

896
00:57:37,036 --> 00:57:39,746
- So who's this guy?

897
00:57:39,873 --> 00:57:41,832
- That is...

898
00:57:41,958 --> 00:57:44,209
me and Joe Strummer

899
00:57:44,335 --> 00:57:47,588
in the summer of '79
at the 100 club in London.

900
00:57:47,714 --> 00:57:49,339
- Who's Joe Strummer?

901
00:57:49,466 --> 00:57:52,801
- Joe Strummer most likely
made love to your mother, Al,

902
00:57:52,927 --> 00:57:54,720
and then wrote
a song about it.

903
00:57:54,846 --> 00:57:55,846
Here's the two of us

904
00:57:55,972 --> 00:57:57,639
throwing up together
at the CBGB's.

905
00:57:57,765 --> 00:58:00,893
- Hey, who is that?

906
00:58:01,019 --> 00:58:02,102
- Oh.

907
00:58:02,228 --> 00:58:03,479
That's me and Ed McMahon,

908
00:58:03,605 --> 00:58:06,106
Ed Mc-wild-man.

909
00:58:07,484 --> 00:58:09,318
Now, he's a true punk.

910
00:58:09,444 --> 00:58:14,156
Basically, for me,
dog work is a thrill,

911
00:58:14,282 --> 00:58:15,782
an adrenaline rush,
if you will,

912
00:58:15,909 --> 00:58:17,367
that's otherwise
hard for me

913
00:58:17,494 --> 00:58:19,495
to replicate
in the world of yogurt.

914
00:58:19,621 --> 00:58:21,538
- Especially now
that you're not a punk.

915
00:58:21,664 --> 00:58:25,918
- Well, I'll always be a punk
in here, Al, make no mistake.

916
00:58:26,044 --> 00:58:29,463
But there's less need for me
to call myself a punk

917
00:58:29,589 --> 00:58:32,716
in a world when the very notion
of punkdom

918
00:58:32,842 --> 00:58:36,053
has been commodified
for the mass market.

919
00:58:36,179 --> 00:58:37,137
- Okay.

920
00:58:37,263 --> 00:58:38,889
- How do you like your marsala?

921
00:58:39,015 --> 00:58:40,474
- It's really good.

922
00:58:40,600 --> 00:58:41,600
- Yeah?

923
00:58:41,726 --> 00:58:44,061
- Oh, you're not gonna eat any?

924
00:58:44,187 --> 00:58:45,771
- No, I-I liquefied it.

925
00:58:45,897 --> 00:58:48,190
Listen, I would just like
to formally

926
00:58:48,316 --> 00:58:51,401
and quite sincerely apologize
to you

927
00:58:51,528 --> 00:58:53,987
for the BB gun incident.

928
00:58:54,113 --> 00:58:55,197
I lost my cool.

929
00:58:55,323 --> 00:58:56,573
I was scared for Sue,

930
00:58:56,699 --> 00:58:58,283
scared for the dogs,

931
00:58:58,409 --> 00:59:01,370
scared for the general
well-being of the pool.

932
00:59:01,496 --> 00:59:03,455
So I just want to say
that I'm-

933
00:59:03,581 --> 00:59:05,707
I'm sorry, M-

934
00:59:05,833 --> 00:59:06,833
- Mike.

935
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:10,504
- My friend. I blundered.

936
00:59:10,630 --> 00:59:12,172
- Yeah, that's all right.

937
00:59:12,298 --> 00:59:15,926
- Yeah, so now that's
behind us.

938
00:59:16,052 --> 00:59:18,387
And Sue tells me
that-that you're a painter.

939
00:59:18,513 --> 00:59:20,013
(Sue clears throat)

940
00:59:20,139 --> 00:59:21,431
- Yeah, very...

941
00:59:21,558 --> 00:59:24,142
very talented painter.

942
00:59:24,269 --> 00:59:25,811
- When did you have
the opportunity

943
00:59:25,937 --> 00:59:27,980
to become acquainted
with his work, Sue?

944
00:59:28,106 --> 00:59:31,858
- That was-it was my
last business trip

945
00:59:31,985 --> 00:59:33,902
for Corporate Bliss.

946
00:59:34,028 --> 00:59:35,028
- Hmm.

947
00:59:35,154 --> 00:59:38,448
And you saw her
and thought,

948
00:59:38,575 --> 00:59:42,452
"Great opportunity
to promote my art,"

949
00:59:42,579 --> 00:59:45,747
or you thought,
"Beautiful woman"?

950
00:59:47,125 --> 00:59:50,043
- The first part-one-
the art one.

951
00:59:50,169 --> 00:59:52,087
- Now, and so you're the guy

952
00:59:52,213 --> 00:59:55,924
who paints foxes and hounds
for corporate art?

953
00:59:56,050 --> 00:59:57,384
- Yeah.

954
00:59:57,510 --> 00:59:59,303
- Okay, 'cause I've got
something to say about that.

955
00:59:59,429 --> 01:00:01,888
You take a Rottweiler-

956
01:00:02,015 --> 01:00:05,976
well, no, let's say
a Malinois chasing a fox,

957
01:00:06,102 --> 01:00:08,687
you got a seriously
new dynamic on your hands,

958
01:00:08,813 --> 01:00:10,272
because a Malinois

959
01:00:10,398 --> 01:00:12,024
on a fox's ass,

960
01:00:12,150 --> 01:00:14,568
that'd be a trip,

961
01:00:14,694 --> 01:00:18,572
because a Malinois is gonna
turn that little fox

962
01:00:18,698 --> 01:00:21,366
into fox meat
inside of 23 seconds.

963
01:00:21,492 --> 01:00:22,659
You know what I'm saying?

964
01:00:22,785 --> 01:00:25,120
So I'd just like to lobby
for that a little bit.

965
01:00:25,246 --> 01:00:26,246
- Okay.

966
01:00:26,372 --> 01:00:28,081
- That was really
great chicken, Jango.

967
01:00:28,207 --> 01:00:29,791
- I love that fucking chicken,
Jango.

968
01:00:29,917 --> 01:00:32,419
- Oh, hey, you had
better chicken than that,

969
01:00:32,545 --> 01:00:33,920
you'd have to be
a rooster.

970
01:00:34,047 --> 01:00:37,049
(laughter)

971
01:00:37,967 --> 01:00:39,968
Oh, hey, speaking of,

972
01:00:40,094 --> 01:00:41,261
who's up for some dessert?

973
01:00:41,387 --> 01:00:42,554
- Wow.

974
01:00:42,680 --> 01:00:45,140
- Got a new flavor I want
to try out on you guys,

975
01:00:45,266 --> 01:00:48,810
Henry Rollins
Chicken Wing Crunch.

976
01:00:51,689 --> 01:00:52,648
- Hey, Sue.

977
01:00:52,774 --> 01:00:55,108
Mike and I are gonna go
to the cowboy club after this,

978
01:00:55,234 --> 01:00:56,818
and if you want to join us,
you know,

979
01:00:56,944 --> 01:00:58,570
they got
really great dancing.

980
01:00:58,696 --> 01:01:02,616
- I'll think about it.

981
01:01:08,915 --> 01:01:09,873
- What I'm trying to say

982
01:01:09,999 --> 01:01:13,043
is that China is not only gonna
kick America's economic butt,

983
01:01:13,169 --> 01:01:14,711
but is gonna invade
your whole country.

984
01:01:14,837 --> 01:01:16,254
I am talking
about you guys getting,

985
01:01:16,381 --> 01:01:17,631
like, a whole new flag
and whatnot.

986
01:01:17,757 --> 01:01:19,049
- I'm not-

987
01:01:19,175 --> 01:01:20,676
- You need
to reorient the way

988
01:01:20,802 --> 01:01:22,010
you think about
the Asians, Mike,

989
01:01:22,136 --> 01:01:23,970
because we will
blow your mind

990
01:01:24,097 --> 01:01:25,722
with our uniqueness
and inner beauty.

991
01:01:25,848 --> 01:01:26,848
You think she's hot?

992
01:01:26,974 --> 01:01:30,060
Yeah, sort of.

993
01:01:30,186 --> 01:01:32,062
- Hi, guys.
- Yes.

994
01:01:32,188 --> 01:01:34,356
- Sue, hi.

995
01:01:34,482 --> 01:01:36,817
- Hi, Mike.

996
01:01:38,778 --> 01:01:39,736
- You didn't bring Jango,

997
01:01:39,862 --> 01:01:40,821
did you?

998
01:01:40,947 --> 01:01:43,365
- No, no, he-
he got kind of drunk,

999
01:01:43,491 --> 01:01:47,536
so I just told him
that I had an errand.

1000
01:01:49,622 --> 01:01:50,872
- Hey, you want to dance
with us, Sue?

1001
01:01:50,998 --> 01:01:51,998
- No.

1002
01:01:52,125 --> 01:01:53,250
- Come on, I know
you got a move.

1003
01:01:53,376 --> 01:01:54,334
- I don't have a move.

1004
01:01:54,460 --> 01:01:56,211
- Everybody's
got a move, Sue.

1005
01:01:56,337 --> 01:01:58,213
- Mike, show her your move.
- I don't have a move.

1006
01:01:58,339 --> 01:01:59,756
- Sue, don't you think
Mike's got moves?

1007
01:01:59,882 --> 01:02:02,175
- I bet you have a move.

1008
01:02:02,301 --> 01:02:03,510
- Come on, let's bust a move.

1009
01:02:03,636 --> 01:02:04,594
- Come on.

1010
01:02:04,721 --> 01:02:06,012
- (laughs)

1011
01:02:08,349 --> 01:02:14,020
- # I put on lipstick, paint,
and powder #

1012
01:02:14,147 --> 01:02:19,735
# When I do, it's all you see #

1013
01:02:19,861 --> 01:02:25,073
# Giving someone
what they wanted #

1014
01:02:25,199 --> 01:02:30,370
# wasn't all
I thought it'd be #

1015
01:02:30,496 --> 01:02:32,289
# Don't make it better #

1016
01:02:32,415 --> 01:02:36,376
# Make it worse #

1017
01:02:36,502 --> 01:02:41,465
# Make it new or make it done #

1018
01:02:41,591 --> 01:02:47,095
# I guess I'll be all right
without you #

1019
01:02:47,221 --> 01:02:50,557
# Girl, it's better
when you're gone #

1020
01:02:56,230 --> 01:02:58,565
- Hey, did you hear?

1021
01:02:58,691 --> 01:02:59,649
Aberdeen is building

1022
01:02:59,776 --> 01:03:02,486
the biggest biodiesel fuel plant
in the country.

1023
01:03:02,612 --> 01:03:03,987
- Whatever you say, Mike.

1024
01:03:04,113 --> 01:03:06,072
- No, we should find a way
to get in on that.

1025
01:03:06,949 --> 01:03:07,949
- Yeah.

1026
01:03:13,539 --> 01:03:15,081
- Hey, Jango.

1027
01:03:15,208 --> 01:03:18,919
- You know why I'll always be
a punk, Matt?

1028
01:03:19,045 --> 01:03:20,462
- Mike.
- Mike.

1029
01:03:20,588 --> 01:03:24,966
'Cause I take
very little shit.

1030
01:03:25,676 --> 01:03:26,635
- Whoa, hey!

1031
01:03:26,761 --> 01:03:28,512
(dog barking)

1032
01:03:28,638 --> 01:03:30,847
- I'm watching you, Matt.

1033
01:03:30,973 --> 01:03:32,432
(dog barking)

1034
01:03:32,558 --> 01:03:34,601
You stay away from her.

1035
01:03:34,727 --> 01:03:37,771
- (groans)

1036
01:03:37,897 --> 01:03:39,147
- Christ, Mike.

1037
01:03:39,273 --> 01:03:40,315
Mike, Mike,
you all right, dude?

1038
01:03:40,441 --> 01:03:42,442
- I'll get him back.

1039
01:03:42,568 --> 01:03:43,610
- All right.

1040
01:03:43,736 --> 01:03:44,694
Yeah, man, yeah.

1041
01:03:44,821 --> 01:03:46,404
He's a scumbag.

1042
01:03:46,531 --> 01:03:49,533
- He's gonna regret that.

1043
01:03:55,915 --> 01:03:57,207
- So you sure
you want to do this?

1044
01:03:57,333 --> 01:03:58,834
- Look, don't come
if you don't want.

1045
01:03:58,960 --> 01:04:01,586
- Dude, I'm with you.

1046
01:04:01,712 --> 01:04:03,463
- Okay, let's do it.

1047
01:04:04,757 --> 01:04:06,466
- Let's go.

1048
01:04:27,154 --> 01:04:30,156
(soft melody)

1049
01:04:30,283 --> 01:04:32,492
# #

1050
01:04:32,618 --> 01:04:34,160
- # Baby #

1051
01:04:34,287 --> 01:04:36,997
# when I think about you #

1052
01:04:37,123 --> 01:04:43,086
# I think about love #

1053
01:04:43,212 --> 01:04:44,796
# Darling #

1054
01:04:44,922 --> 01:04:48,049
# don't live without you #

1055
01:04:48,175 --> 01:04:53,179
# and your love #

1056
01:04:53,306 --> 01:04:55,223
# If I had #

1057
01:04:55,349 --> 01:04:58,268
# those golden dreams #

1058
01:04:58,394 --> 01:05:03,315
# of my yesterday #

1059
01:05:03,441 --> 01:05:05,859
# I would wrap you #

1060
01:05:05,985 --> 01:05:08,486
# in the heavens #

1061
01:05:08,613 --> 01:05:13,116
# till I'm dyin' on the way #

1062
01:05:13,242 --> 01:05:14,659
# Feel like makin' #

1063
01:05:14,785 --> 01:05:18,455
# #

1064
01:05:18,581 --> 01:05:21,249
# I feel like makin' love #

1065
01:05:21,375 --> 01:05:23,835
# #

1066
01:05:23,961 --> 01:05:32,886
# I feel like makin' love #

1067
01:05:35,014 --> 01:05:46,399
# Feel like makin' love to you #

1068
01:05:46,525 --> 01:05:47,525
Dude, that was awesome.

1069
01:05:47,652 --> 01:05:48,610
(metallic clank)

1070
01:05:48,736 --> 01:05:51,154
- Just...

1071
01:05:52,490 --> 01:05:55,116
- Dude, let's go.

1072
01:05:55,242 --> 01:05:56,660
- Wait, wait.

1073
01:05:56,786 --> 01:05:58,411
Go, go, go.

1074
01:05:58,537 --> 01:05:59,496
- Shit.

1075
01:05:59,622 --> 01:06:01,498
- I love you, Sue.

1076
01:06:02,833 --> 01:06:04,209
Eat that, dog man!

1077
01:06:04,335 --> 01:06:06,628
- You suck!

1078
01:06:20,184 --> 01:06:23,228
- Mike, you have a visitor.

1079
01:06:23,354 --> 01:06:24,813
- Okay.

1080
01:06:44,875 --> 01:06:46,626
- We need to talk, Mike.

1081
01:06:46,752 --> 01:06:48,503
- I know.

1082
01:06:48,629 --> 01:06:50,755
I've been leaving you messages.

1083
01:06:50,881 --> 01:06:53,717
I mean, did-
did you tell him

1084
01:06:53,843 --> 01:06:55,427
about us?

1085
01:06:55,553 --> 01:06:57,512
- Yes.

1086
01:07:00,099 --> 01:07:01,433
- Why?

1087
01:07:03,769 --> 01:07:05,228
- Because I'm marrying him.

1088
01:07:06,856 --> 01:07:07,814
- What?

1089
01:07:07,940 --> 01:07:10,233
- Which I-I need you to accept.

1090
01:07:10,359 --> 01:07:11,735
- Why?

1091
01:07:11,861 --> 01:07:14,154
- Because I'm at a point
in my life

1092
01:07:14,280 --> 01:07:16,740
where there are certain things
that I need.

1093
01:07:16,866 --> 01:07:17,949
- Like what?

1094
01:07:18,075 --> 01:07:19,659
- Like a certain kind of love.

1095
01:07:19,785 --> 01:07:21,745
- Well, what-what kind?

1096
01:07:21,871 --> 01:07:25,707
- The kind that is not
like an unguided missile.

1097
01:07:25,833 --> 01:07:29,711
You can't just stalk people
around the country.

1098
01:07:29,837 --> 01:07:34,257
You can't parachute
into people's pools,

1099
01:07:34,383 --> 01:07:36,551
knock on people's motel rooms

1100
01:07:36,677 --> 01:07:38,553
just because
you're feeling lonely.

1101
01:07:40,139 --> 01:07:42,015
Life isn't like that.

1102
01:07:42,141 --> 01:07:45,060
For you to-to be with someone,

1103
01:07:45,186 --> 01:07:49,022
it's-it's not all about
what you need.

1104
01:07:49,148 --> 01:07:50,732
It's got to be more selfless
than that, Mike.

1105
01:07:50,858 --> 01:07:53,568
It's got to be
more selfless than that.

1106
01:07:53,694 --> 01:07:56,196
- Oh, like-like,

1107
01:07:56,322 --> 01:07:58,740
save everyone else in the world
except yourself?

1108
01:07:58,866 --> 01:08:00,784
- I don't-
that's not what I do.

1109
01:08:00,910 --> 01:08:02,786
- Yes, it is.
- No, it's not.

1110
01:08:02,912 --> 01:08:03,995
- Yes, it is.

1111
01:08:04,121 --> 01:08:06,623
You're so busy
being selfless

1112
01:08:06,749 --> 01:08:09,501
that you end up
treating yourself like shit.

1113
01:08:09,627 --> 01:08:12,796
- Is that really
what you think of me?

1114
01:08:12,922 --> 01:08:16,925
- I'm just-I'm just saying,
I know what you need.

1115
01:08:17,051 --> 01:08:18,635
- Which is what?

1116
01:08:18,761 --> 01:08:23,181
- To take care
of yourself a little...

1117
01:08:23,307 --> 01:08:24,432
so that the people
who love you

1118
01:08:24,558 --> 01:08:26,392
don't feel like
they're annoying you.

1119
01:08:28,813 --> 01:08:33,399
Sue, Sue,
just marry me, okay?

1120
01:08:33,526 --> 01:08:36,194
Just let the world
go screw itself

1121
01:08:36,320 --> 01:08:39,656
for a half second
and just see what happens,

1122
01:08:39,782 --> 01:08:42,408
and maybe it'll be okay.

1123
01:08:46,122 --> 01:08:48,164
- I'm getting married
on Saturday.

1124
01:08:48,290 --> 01:08:50,291
- Why?

1125
01:08:52,378 --> 01:08:54,504
- Because I'm pregnant.

1126
01:08:58,676 --> 01:09:03,054
And I'm gonna have it, and...

1127
01:09:03,180 --> 01:09:06,349
it's what I want.

1128
01:09:08,936 --> 01:09:10,770
- You're having a child?

1129
01:09:15,067 --> 01:09:18,444
Could-could it be mine?

1130
01:09:18,571 --> 01:09:21,322
- No.

1131
01:09:27,538 --> 01:09:29,038
Which is why
I'm getting married.

1132
01:09:33,836 --> 01:09:36,671
Mike, I can't afford
to be selfish on this one.

1133
01:09:38,924 --> 01:09:40,300
I just have to be with somebody

1134
01:09:40,426 --> 01:09:43,011
who knows what they're doing
with their life.

1135
01:09:46,432 --> 01:09:49,726
Sorry.

1136
01:09:49,852 --> 01:09:52,562
Sweet just doesn't cut it.

1137
01:10:03,741 --> 01:10:06,284
- Can you leave now, please?

1138
01:10:08,495 --> 01:10:10,997
Just leave, okay?

1139
01:10:13,876 --> 01:10:16,044
Get out of my basement, Sue.

1140
01:10:17,546 --> 01:10:18,504
Susan, get-

1141
01:10:18,631 --> 01:10:19,631
I'm serious.

1142
01:10:19,757 --> 01:10:21,799
Get the fuck out of my basement

1143
01:10:21,926 --> 01:10:25,428
right now!

1144
01:11:26,365 --> 01:11:29,450
- I wish I had that dickwad's
BB gun right now.

1145
01:11:29,576 --> 01:11:31,661
They going on a honeymoon?

1146
01:11:31,787 --> 01:11:35,373
- I don't know.

1147
01:11:35,499 --> 01:11:38,084
- Yeah, they're probably waiting
till yogurt season's over.

1148
01:11:48,512 --> 01:11:49,512
You're gonna be all right.

1149
01:11:49,638 --> 01:11:52,682
- Yeah, yeah.

1150
01:11:54,685 --> 01:11:56,561
I just want to say, Al...

1151
01:12:00,941 --> 01:12:03,067
You're the best friend
I ever had.

1152
01:12:04,653 --> 01:12:05,820
- Ditto.

1153
01:12:14,955 --> 01:12:16,831
What a douchebag, huh?

1154
01:12:16,957 --> 01:12:21,210
(cheers and applause)

1155
01:12:21,337 --> 01:12:25,298
You know, it's enough to make
you want to be a Buddhist monk.

1156
01:12:25,424 --> 01:12:27,216
My people are really good
at that stuff.

1157
01:12:27,343 --> 01:12:30,011
- Yeah?

1158
01:12:36,018 --> 01:12:39,479
- No, dude,
don't get carried away.

1159
01:12:39,605 --> 01:12:44,150
- # Well, I don't know
what I'm looking for #

1160
01:12:44,276 --> 01:12:46,277
- Oh, sure.

1161
01:12:48,614 --> 01:12:51,115
- And you can see
by our next slide-

1162
01:12:54,161 --> 01:12:56,579
- # For some people,
it's an easy choice #

1163
01:12:56,705 --> 01:13:01,292
# But for me, there's a devil
and an angel's voice #

1164
01:13:01,418 --> 01:13:04,045
# Well, I don't know
what I am looking for #

1165
01:13:04,171 --> 01:13:10,134
# But I know that I just
want to look some more #

1166
01:13:14,139 --> 01:13:16,682
# Well, I don't know
what I'm looking for #

1167
01:13:16,809 --> 01:13:21,187
# But I know that I just
want to look some more #

1168
01:13:21,313 --> 01:13:23,189
# And you hear it
from the strangers #

1169
01:13:23,315 --> 01:13:24,941
# and you hear it from friends #

1170
01:13:25,067 --> 01:13:26,651
# that love never dies #

1171
01:13:26,777 --> 01:13:28,152
- It's one point.
Don't worry about it.

1172
01:13:28,278 --> 01:13:29,237
Now, serve the ball.

1173
01:13:29,363 --> 01:13:30,446
You got it.

1174
01:13:33,158 --> 01:13:35,660
Come on!

1175
01:13:35,786 --> 01:13:38,329
- # Well, I don't know
what I am living for #

1176
01:13:38,455 --> 01:13:43,459
# But I know that I just
want to live some more #

1177
01:13:51,593 --> 01:13:55,138
- Michael, the progress you've
made in your four months here

1178
01:13:55,264 --> 01:13:56,722
has been remarkable.

1179
01:13:56,849 --> 01:13:58,224
- Thank you, Father.

1180
01:13:58,350 --> 01:13:59,725
- Needless to say,
your immersion

1181
01:13:59,852 --> 01:14:01,853
in the duty of carrot chopper

1182
01:14:01,979 --> 01:14:05,356
and broom chief
has been full and complete.

1183
01:14:05,482 --> 01:14:06,983
- Thank you.

1184
01:14:07,109 --> 01:14:09,193
- But some worries
have arisen.

1185
01:14:09,319 --> 01:14:10,736
- Such as what, Father?

1186
01:14:10,863 --> 01:14:11,904
- Well, first of all,

1187
01:14:12,030 --> 01:14:15,241
you're not supposed
to call me Father.

1188
01:14:15,367 --> 01:14:16,325
- Oh.

1189
01:14:16,452 --> 01:14:18,870
- But I must say, I admit,
I've grown fond of it.

1190
01:14:18,996 --> 01:14:22,081
Michael...

1191
01:14:22,207 --> 01:14:26,335
an aspiring bodhisattva
such as yourself

1192
01:14:26,462 --> 01:14:30,131
should seek to produce a heart
that does not dwell.

1193
01:14:30,257 --> 01:14:32,300
- Of course, father.

1194
01:14:32,426 --> 01:14:37,054
- And your heart, Michael,
may I say, it does dwell.

1195
01:14:37,181 --> 01:14:38,473
- No, it doesn't.

1196
01:14:38,599 --> 01:14:39,640
- It does, Michael.

1197
01:14:39,766 --> 01:14:43,436
You have not transcended
your earthly passions.

1198
01:14:44,646 --> 01:14:48,107
To put it bluntly,
you are stuck.

1199
01:14:49,151 --> 01:14:51,569
You also spend too much time
playing volleyball.

1200
01:14:51,695 --> 01:14:55,072
- Yeah, but I thought
that was permitted, Father.

1201
01:14:55,199 --> 01:14:56,282
- Yes, but not
for seven hours a day.

1202
01:14:56,408 --> 01:15:00,077
- Also, you encouraged it
for stress release.

1203
01:15:00,204 --> 01:15:02,330
- Yes, I did, yes.

1204
01:15:02,456 --> 01:15:04,165
But, Michael,

1205
01:15:04,291 --> 01:15:06,584
Buddhist monks
aren't supposed to have

1206
01:15:06,710 --> 01:15:10,213
seven hours a day
worth of stress.

1207
01:15:10,339 --> 01:15:14,050
We are Buddhist monks,
Buddhist monks.

1208
01:15:18,555 --> 01:15:21,307
- So what should I do?

1209
01:15:21,433 --> 01:15:24,977
- My parents died
when I was ten.

1210
01:15:25,103 --> 01:15:28,022
Two months later,
my uncle and I moved to America.

1211
01:15:28,148 --> 01:15:31,275
I was forced to let go
of everything I knew

1212
01:15:31,401 --> 01:15:34,278
in order to move on.

1213
01:15:34,404 --> 01:15:37,865
Sometimes in life,
you must do that.

1214
01:15:39,952 --> 01:15:42,036
- Where are you from, Father?

1215
01:15:43,038 --> 01:15:46,707
- Vietnam,
Hau Nghia Province.

1216
01:15:48,877 --> 01:15:52,171
My parents were killed
in the war.

1217
01:15:52,297 --> 01:15:53,422
- By the Americans?

1218
01:15:53,549 --> 01:15:56,008
- Yes.

1219
01:15:56,134 --> 01:15:57,468
And yet I moved here.

1220
01:15:58,762 --> 01:16:01,973
Life is odd.

1221
01:16:05,978 --> 01:16:07,353
- I'm sorry.

1222
01:16:07,479 --> 01:16:08,980
- No, no, no.

1223
01:16:09,106 --> 01:16:12,608
It is not your fault.

1224
01:16:13,402 --> 01:16:15,861
Let go, Mike.

1225
01:16:15,988 --> 01:16:19,240
Let go and move on.

1226
01:17:35,525 --> 01:17:36,984
- I recog-noodle you.

1227
01:17:37,110 --> 01:17:38,944
- Yeah, I'm the guy who
sold you my mom's necklace.

1228
01:17:39,071 --> 01:17:41,656
- Oh, yeah, that's right.

1229
01:17:41,782 --> 01:17:43,324
What can I do you for?

1230
01:17:43,450 --> 01:17:44,825
- I want it back.

1231
01:18:01,426 --> 01:18:02,593
Dad.

1232
01:18:02,719 --> 01:18:05,346
Do you want me
to make you some dinner?

1233
01:18:05,472 --> 01:18:08,307
- No, I'm all right.

1234
01:18:08,433 --> 01:18:11,268
- Okay.

1235
01:18:19,152 --> 01:18:22,405
Dad, when you were over
in Vietnam,

1236
01:18:22,531 --> 01:18:27,868
did you ever do any fighting
in the Hau Nghia Province?

1237
01:18:33,834 --> 01:18:36,252
- Yeah.

1238
01:18:36,378 --> 01:18:38,129
Why?

1239
01:18:41,550 --> 01:18:43,676
- I just met this guy
up at the monastery

1240
01:18:43,802 --> 01:18:47,596
who's from that area.

1241
01:18:47,723 --> 01:18:50,391
He seemed to really
have his shit together.

1242
01:18:53,311 --> 01:18:55,813
- Good to hear.

1243
01:19:09,369 --> 01:19:10,327
- Dad, I've been thinking.

1244
01:19:10,454 --> 01:19:12,121
Maybe you should
sell this place.

1245
01:19:13,874 --> 01:19:15,332
You don't even
like it here.

1246
01:19:16,209 --> 01:19:17,626
This was Mom's thing.

1247
01:19:17,753 --> 01:19:20,004
- Why do you say that?

1248
01:19:20,130 --> 01:19:23,799
- 'Cause it's true.

1249
01:19:23,925 --> 01:19:26,635
Come on, Mom loved people,
loved running things.

1250
01:19:26,762 --> 01:19:28,095
It's not like you.

1251
01:19:28,221 --> 01:19:30,598
You're not like
a people person, Dad.

1252
01:19:32,684 --> 01:19:35,352
You should let it go.

1253
01:19:35,479 --> 01:19:37,480
Move on.

1254
01:19:37,606 --> 01:19:38,939
Otherwise,
you're just gonna rot.

1255
01:19:39,065 --> 01:19:40,441
- Sell it and do what?

1256
01:19:40,567 --> 01:19:41,525
- Anything.

1257
01:19:41,651 --> 01:19:42,735
You still have time.

1258
01:19:42,861 --> 01:19:43,861
You'd have money.

1259
01:19:46,198 --> 01:19:47,948
- What do you need, Mike,
a loan?

1260
01:19:49,201 --> 01:19:51,535
- No.

1261
01:19:51,661 --> 01:19:56,457
I just wanted to say that this
doesn't have to be it...

1262
01:19:59,961 --> 01:20:02,671
And that I love you.

1263
01:20:24,486 --> 01:20:26,028
- "Dear Mike,

1264
01:20:26,154 --> 01:20:28,364
"I know you probably don't want
to hear from me,

1265
01:20:28,490 --> 01:20:30,866
"and I can't say I blame you.

1266
01:20:30,992 --> 01:20:33,994
"But I wanted to write anyway
to let you know what I think,

1267
01:20:34,120 --> 01:20:37,998
"which is that I think
you had a point that day

1268
01:20:38,124 --> 01:20:41,001
"about people who hide
behind their causes

1269
01:20:41,127 --> 01:20:43,420
"in order to avoid their lives.

1270
01:20:46,800 --> 01:20:49,552
'"You had a point down there
in that basement,

1271
01:20:49,678 --> 01:20:53,889
'"with the soy sauce
and the mice.

1272
01:20:54,015 --> 01:20:58,811
"And so I wanted to say thanks.

1273
01:20:58,937 --> 01:21:04,108
"Because of you, Mike,
I'm not the same person I was.

1274
01:21:04,234 --> 01:21:05,901
"Good-bye, Mike.

1275
01:21:06,027 --> 01:21:08,195
Love, Sue."

1276
01:21:14,327 --> 01:21:17,162
- So I thought about
what you said the other day.

1277
01:21:17,289 --> 01:21:23,043
I think you had a point.

1278
01:21:23,169 --> 01:21:26,380
That being said,
this is yours.

1279
01:21:27,757 --> 01:21:28,757
- What is it?

1280
01:21:28,884 --> 01:21:31,760
- Deed to the motel,
signed over to you.

1281
01:21:35,223 --> 01:21:37,182
- Dad, that's not-
that's not why-

1282
01:21:37,309 --> 01:21:39,602
- It's fine.

1283
01:21:39,728 --> 01:21:42,813
I don't need it.

1284
01:21:42,939 --> 01:21:44,273
Your mom was good
about that.

1285
01:21:44,399 --> 01:21:47,818
You-you can't just give me
the motel.

1286
01:21:48,820 --> 01:21:50,070
- It's your birthright.

1287
01:21:52,365 --> 01:21:54,241
- What would you do?

1288
01:21:54,367 --> 01:21:57,077
- I want to get in shape,

1289
01:21:57,203 --> 01:22:00,706
maybe join one of those
basketball leagues.

1290
01:22:00,832 --> 01:22:04,543
How about you?

1291
01:22:04,669 --> 01:22:05,669
- I don't know.

1292
01:22:05,795 --> 01:22:09,006
I'll think of something.

1293
01:22:09,132 --> 01:22:10,215
- You done
with the monk stuff?

1294
01:22:10,342 --> 01:22:14,553
- Yeah, I'll still
occasionally do it,

1295
01:22:14,679 --> 01:22:17,181
I mean,
not professionally, but-

1296
01:22:21,269 --> 01:22:23,020
- What about that girl?

1297
01:22:25,690 --> 01:22:27,942
- Oh, that didn't work out.

1298
01:22:28,068 --> 01:22:34,573
Yeah, we weren't, you know,
like, meant for each other.

1299
01:22:34,699 --> 01:22:37,910
- I don't know, Mike.

1300
01:22:38,036 --> 01:22:40,120
Things change in life.

1301
01:22:42,290 --> 01:22:43,958
- What do you mean?

1302
01:22:44,084 --> 01:22:46,418
- You're not
the same guy you were.

1303
01:22:54,594 --> 01:22:56,553
Good soup.

1304
01:23:00,350 --> 01:23:03,352
- Good soup.

1305
01:23:15,865 --> 01:23:18,450
You can do this, Mike.

1306
01:23:24,833 --> 01:23:26,291
- So I'm gonna hit
the gym.

1307
01:23:26,418 --> 01:23:27,876
- Oh, yeah?

1308
01:23:28,003 --> 01:23:29,503
- Yeah, they have
a senior citizen hoop run

1309
01:23:29,629 --> 01:23:33,173
from 3:00 to 5:00.

1310
01:23:33,299 --> 01:23:34,258
Got a new ball.

1311
01:23:34,384 --> 01:23:36,385
- Yeah, I see.

1312
01:23:38,430 --> 01:23:39,430
- All right, Mike.

1313
01:23:39,556 --> 01:23:40,556
- See you.

1314
01:23:53,028 --> 01:23:53,986
- Hello?

1315
01:23:54,112 --> 01:23:55,988
- Hi, Jango,
it's Mike, Sue's friend.

1316
01:23:56,114 --> 01:23:57,114
- Hi, Mike.

1317
01:23:57,240 --> 01:23:59,992
- Hi, look, I know
that I'm probably not the guy

1318
01:24:00,118 --> 01:24:01,201
you want to hear from right now,

1319
01:24:01,327 --> 01:24:03,954
but I need to tell Sue
about what I'm doing down here.

1320
01:24:04,080 --> 01:24:05,122
And I think that when she hears

1321
01:24:05,248 --> 01:24:06,623
what I'm up to,
she'll at least understand

1322
01:24:06,750 --> 01:24:07,833
that if nothing else-

1323
01:24:07,959 --> 01:24:08,959
- Mike?

1324
01:24:09,085 --> 01:24:10,210
- Yeah.

1325
01:24:10,336 --> 01:24:12,046
- We split up.

1326
01:24:12,172 --> 01:24:14,506
Sue and I split up.

1327
01:24:14,632 --> 01:24:16,675
She left me...

1328
01:24:16,801 --> 01:24:19,470
went back to Maryland
to be with her mom.

1329
01:24:19,596 --> 01:24:21,764
- # From the rainwater well #

1330
01:24:21,890 --> 01:24:25,684
# deep as a secret
nobody knows #

1331
01:24:28,480 --> 01:24:29,563
- # I know you want to #

1332
01:24:29,689 --> 01:24:33,650
# run far away from one more #

1333
01:24:33,777 --> 01:24:36,195
# and that it's coming
at a bad time #

1334
01:24:36,321 --> 01:24:38,322
# Some cold place #

1335
01:24:38,448 --> 01:24:41,742
# heartless ways #

1336
01:24:41,868 --> 01:24:43,452
# for all we know #

1337
01:24:55,465 --> 01:24:57,549
(doorbell rings)

1338
01:24:57,675 --> 01:24:58,675
- Hi.
- Hi.

1339
01:24:58,802 --> 01:25:00,385
Are you Mary Claussen?

1340
01:25:00,512 --> 01:25:02,012
- Yes.

1341
01:25:02,138 --> 01:25:04,932
- Hi.

1342
01:25:05,058 --> 01:25:06,225
- I'm a friend of Sue's.

1343
01:25:06,351 --> 01:25:07,351
Is she home?

1344
01:25:07,477 --> 01:25:08,894
- Who are you?

1345
01:25:09,020 --> 01:25:12,022
- Mike from management.

1346
01:25:12,148 --> 01:25:15,859
- Oh.

1347
01:25:15,985 --> 01:25:16,944
Sue.

1348
01:25:17,070 --> 01:25:19,404
Mike is here.

1349
01:25:33,962 --> 01:25:37,923
- # We thought we lost you #

1350
01:25:38,049 --> 01:25:42,177
# We thought we lost you #

1351
01:25:43,012 --> 01:25:47,015
- Hi.

1352
01:25:52,564 --> 01:25:53,605
- How's the baby?

1353
01:25:56,234 --> 01:25:58,402
- So far, so good.

1354
01:25:58,528 --> 01:26:01,363
- Are you okay?

1355
01:26:03,825 --> 01:26:05,450
- Yeah.

1356
01:26:14,169 --> 01:26:15,627
I'm really sorry, Mike.

1357
01:26:16,713 --> 01:26:18,422
- Why?

1358
01:26:18,548 --> 01:26:21,425
- 'Cause I really
messed up with you.

1359
01:26:21,551 --> 01:26:24,595
- But you were right.

1360
01:26:24,721 --> 01:26:26,555
I was like a kid.

1361
01:26:32,145 --> 01:26:34,771
This is the deed
to the motel.

1362
01:26:37,317 --> 01:26:41,695
I want to turn it
into a homeless shelter

1363
01:26:41,821 --> 01:26:43,405
with midnight basketball.

1364
01:26:46,326 --> 01:26:47,951
I already bought
the soup noodles.

1365
01:26:53,541 --> 01:26:57,961
I was actually hoping
that you might want to help.

1366
01:27:03,593 --> 01:27:06,637
I really love you, Sue.

1367
01:27:06,763 --> 01:27:08,597
And I want
to take care of you

1368
01:27:08,723 --> 01:27:11,016
and whoever it is
that's inside of you.

1369
01:27:16,439 --> 01:27:21,318
All I want is
to be with you.

1370
01:27:21,444 --> 01:27:22,611
That's it.

1371
01:27:32,038 --> 01:27:35,999
Breathe, Sue.

1372
01:27:36,125 --> 01:27:39,211
Just keep breathing.

1373
01:27:51,432 --> 01:27:53,350
- I wrote you a haiku.

1374
01:27:53,476 --> 01:27:56,770
Want to hear it?

1375
01:27:56,896 --> 01:28:01,817
- Sure.

1376
01:28:01,943 --> 01:28:06,780
- Mike, oh, Mike, my man,

1377
01:28:06,906 --> 01:28:10,325
keeps showing up like UPS.

1378
01:28:10,451 --> 01:28:14,496
Sue, you're such a bitch.

1379
01:28:15,999 --> 01:28:17,374
- I like it.

1380
01:28:17,500 --> 01:28:20,168
- You do?
- Yes.

1381
01:28:58,041 --> 01:29:00,417
- # What am I gonna do? #

1382
01:29:00,543 --> 01:29:02,919
# Isn't that just jelly? #

1383
01:29:03,046 --> 01:29:05,213
# All the things I've heard #

1384
01:29:05,340 --> 01:29:08,175
# of all the things you find #

1385
01:29:08,301 --> 01:29:10,594
# I wonder if you know #

1386
01:29:10,720 --> 01:29:13,221
# I wonder if you're bitter #

1387
01:29:13,348 --> 01:29:15,599
# And all that
you've considered #

1388
01:29:15,725 --> 01:29:19,436
# Like marmalade, your mine #

1389
01:29:19,562 --> 01:29:24,566
# And the tow will bring you
down real hard #

1390
01:29:24,692 --> 01:29:28,445
# 'Cause your house
is only made of cards #

1391
01:29:28,571 --> 01:29:31,198
# So sweetly is the dream #

1392
01:29:31,324 --> 01:29:33,450
# in the cookie jar #

1393
01:29:33,576 --> 01:29:36,370
# where everybody is #

1394
01:29:36,496 --> 01:29:38,789
# everywhere you are #

1395
01:29:38,915 --> 01:29:41,333
# Remember what you did #

1396
01:29:41,459 --> 01:29:43,919
# Remember what you said #

1397
01:29:44,045 --> 01:29:46,296
# A lonely macaroon #

1398
01:29:46,422 --> 01:29:49,966
# inside your biscuit head #

1399
01:29:50,093 --> 01:29:55,305
# And the tow will bring you
down real hard #

1400
01:29:55,431 --> 01:30:00,435
# 'Cause your house
is only made of cards #

1401
01:30:24,961 --> 01:30:27,170
# What about the jam we're in #

1402
01:30:27,296 --> 01:30:29,589
# What about
when we were friends #

1403
01:30:29,715 --> 01:30:31,925
# I kept my cookie jar #

1404
01:30:32,051 --> 01:30:34,469
# too high up on the shelf #

1405
01:30:34,595 --> 01:30:37,305
# Here's what I wish for you #

1406
01:30:37,432 --> 01:30:40,142
# Here's what you must do #

1407
01:30:40,268 --> 01:31:08,003
# Preserve yourself #

1408
01:31:08,129 --> 01:31:10,547
# Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah #

1409
01:31:10,673 --> 01:31:12,591
# yeah, yeah, yeah, #

1410
01:31:15,011 --> 01:31:23,393
# Preserve yourself #

1411
01:31:23,519 --> 01:31:28,064
# Oh, oh, oh #
