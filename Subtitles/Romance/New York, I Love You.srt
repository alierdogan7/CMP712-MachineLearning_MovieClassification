1
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:07,200
Hey, go to Williamsburg.
You going to go to--

2
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,667
Oh, I'm sorry, man.
Uh, yeah. Sorry.

3
00:01:08,667 --> 00:01:10,367
Going to Williamsburg.
North 6th and Wythe.

4
00:01:10,367 --> 00:01:12,367
Do you mind?
I'll just hang onto you.

5
00:01:12,367 --> 00:01:14,234
Can you just drop me off
at Williamsburg Bridge?

6
00:01:14,234 --> 00:01:16,534
That's fine because I'm headed
into the Bowery. Do you mind?

7
00:01:16,534 --> 00:01:18,200
All right, that's fine.
We'll just split a fare.

8
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:19,667
Two stops.
Yeah. Chamber Street.

9
00:01:19,667 --> 00:01:22,167
Just take the FDR--
No, no, not FDR Drive.

10
00:01:22,167 --> 00:01:24,200
Not Chamber Street. No.
Oh, my God.
If you take FDR Drive,

11
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:26,567
first of all,
it's more of a fare.
I do this every single day.

12
00:01:26,567 --> 00:01:28,234
It's an extra 20 minutes.
I got to be somewhere.

13
00:01:28,234 --> 00:01:29,701
Take the FDR Drive, please.
It's a lot faster.

14
00:01:29,701 --> 00:01:31,567
I think we can hang down
the West Side Highway

15
00:01:31,567 --> 00:01:33,567
and make a left
on Chamber Street.

16
00:01:33,567 --> 00:01:35,400
There's no point, though.
There's going to be--

17
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:36,667
Bleecker, guys.
We're going Bleecker.

18
00:01:36,667 --> 00:01:38,868
No, we both want
to go to the same area.

19
00:01:38,868 --> 00:01:41,133
Bleecker's going to take
an extra hour.

20
00:01:41,133 --> 00:01:43,334
Bleecker Street is totally
out of the direction.
That's ridiculous.

21
00:01:43,334 --> 00:01:45,067
Both of you, out of the cab.

22
00:01:45,067 --> 00:01:47,501
Wait a second.
Calm down, man.

23
00:01:47,501 --> 00:01:50,334
We're not going to get out.
We'll share the same rate.
We're not going to Bleecker.

24
00:01:50,334 --> 00:01:53,033
Out of my cab.

Hey, sweetheart.
How you doing? It's me.

27
00:02:07,601 --> 00:02:10,601
I'm doing good.
Thinking of you.
Hey.

28
00:02:10,601 --> 00:02:12,300
Yeah, I dreamt
about you last night.

29
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:14,667
I'm ready for you.
Had my Wheaties.

30
00:02:14,667 --> 00:02:16,801
I miss you, too.

31
00:02:16,801 --> 00:02:18,267
You ready?

32
00:02:18,267 --> 00:02:19,701
Okay. I got some surprises.

33
00:02:24,801 --> 00:02:27,601
Whoa. Magnifique.

 Pardon. Excusez-moi,
 mademoiselle.

[toilet flushes]

38
00:03:47,734 --> 00:03:49,834
This yours?

39
00:03:49,834 --> 00:03:53,701
Um, it is. It must have
fallen out of my bag.

40
00:03:53,701 --> 00:03:55,367
It was on the floor
near the bathroom.

41
00:03:55,367 --> 00:03:57,968
That was really nice of you.
How can I thank you?

42
00:03:57,968 --> 00:04:01,267
I wouldn't mind
if you bought me a drink.

43
00:04:01,267 --> 00:04:02,734
Great. What would you like?

44
00:04:02,734 --> 00:04:05,801
Whatever you're having.
Two gin and tonics, no ice.

45
00:04:05,801 --> 00:04:08,067
Losing your cell phone's
like losing your mind.

46
00:04:08,067 --> 00:04:10,267
Do you come here a lot?

47
00:04:10,267 --> 00:04:13,067
I do. A lot. Too much.

48
00:04:13,067 --> 00:04:14,934
Long story.

49
00:04:14,934 --> 00:04:16,067
Tell me.

50
00:04:16,067 --> 00:04:17,734
I've got a ton of time.

51
00:04:17,734 --> 00:04:20,067
[clears throat]
I only saw my dad
once in my whole life,

52
00:04:20,067 --> 00:04:21,734
right here.

53
00:04:21,734 --> 00:04:23,234
When my mom
was pregnant with me,

54
00:04:23,234 --> 00:04:25,267
she never told him.

55
00:04:25,267 --> 00:04:26,567
Just left him.

56
00:04:26,567 --> 00:04:28,200
Growing up, she had
a lot of boyfriends.

57
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:29,934
Went through one
after another.

58
00:04:29,934 --> 00:04:31,100
Always left them.

59
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:32,734
Every time she'd leave
a man, though,

60
00:04:32,734 --> 00:04:34,334
she'd keep something,
like a souvenir.

61
00:04:34,334 --> 00:04:37,567
Maybe a book or a necklace
or a painting.

62
00:04:37,567 --> 00:04:39,934
When she left my dad,
she kept me.

63
00:04:39,934 --> 00:04:41,267
I was her souvenir.

64
00:04:41,267 --> 00:04:43,567
Before she died,
she gave me a piece of paper

65
00:04:43,567 --> 00:04:45,100
with his name
and number on it.

66
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:47,968
I called him up,
and we met here.

67
00:04:47,968 --> 00:04:49,100
I said one thing to him.

68
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:50,968
What did you say?

69
00:04:50,968 --> 00:04:52,100
"Dad."

70
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:53,434
That's it?

71
00:04:53,434 --> 00:04:55,734
"I'm a gift for you,
from Mom."

72
00:04:58,100 --> 00:04:59,033
Thank you.

73
00:05:01,067 --> 00:05:04,534
I walk past your
flower room every day.

74
00:05:04,534 --> 00:05:07,767
I see you,
but I say nothing.

75
00:05:07,767 --> 00:05:11,267
I'm so afraid
to look at you.
Oh, girl.

76
00:05:11,267 --> 00:05:14,968
You say I'm the strongest.
I say you're the kindest.

77
00:05:14,968 --> 00:05:18,467
You ask me where I'm going.
I point to the ocean.

78
00:05:18,467 --> 00:05:19,968
Oh, girl.

79
00:05:22,467 --> 00:05:23,634

I'll leave you two alone.

97

It's possible.

102
00:06:23,934 --> 00:06:25,534
New York's not such
a big place.

You're a good teacher.
Thank you.

So what do you do?

109
00:06:36,067 --> 00:06:37,033
Thief.

110
00:06:38,701 --> 00:06:40,534
Could be.
That is funny.

111

Might be? Used to be?

112
00:06:42,734 --> 00:06:44,000
Will be?

113
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,200
To be or not to be.
Well, I'm a thief.

114

I've been trying to steal you
from your wife,

Yeah, that's my wallet.

 Merci beaucoup.
Money's gone.

124
00:07:15,634 --> 00:07:18,300
I recently lost my wallet,

125
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:20,901

to get my money back.

00:07:25,667 --> 00:07:28,767

How could I?

How did you get these?

No, we are not Hindus.
[clicking tongue]
We are Jains.

161

materialistic for us.

I do business with you,
I have no money for food.

Last year she decided
that marriage was a sin.

213

Now she's in India,

214
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,968

going door to door,

She's not the only one

219
00:12:30,067 --> 00:12:32,000
I had to shave off
all mine this morning

220
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,400

221

Why? What is so wrong

Why you all want
to cut it off?

224

They wanted me to cut it off
on my wedding night.

225
00:12:43,467 --> 00:12:45,601
I said "No way."
Yeah?

226
00:12:45,601 --> 00:12:49,067
It took 25 years to grow,
10 minutes to cut off.

227

for the rest of my life,

What do you mean,
your wife's hair?

232
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:08,033
Most human hair in America
comes from our temples
in India,

233
00:13:08,033 --> 00:13:10,834
where women offer
their long locks to God

234
00:13:10,834 --> 00:13:15,000

can be sold to the West
and you can have your wigs.

00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:06,200
which comes to 4.955 days.

355
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:09,100
But you can round it off
to five days without sleeping.

356
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:11,901
It's impossible. I quit.

357
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:18,200
I quit.

358
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:20,033
[no audio]

359
00:21:20,033 --> 00:21:21,901
Goodbye, Camille.

360
00:21:23,033 --> 00:21:25,701
[phone rings]

361
00:21:27,434 --> 00:21:29,834
[ring]

362
00:21:30,701 --> 00:21:32,801
Hello?
[coughing]

363
00:21:32,801 --> 00:21:35,667
[ring]

364
00:21:35,667 --> 00:21:39,734
 [David on machine]
 Please leave a message
 after the beep.

365
00:21:39,734 --> 00:21:41,567
[beep]

366
00:21:41,567 --> 00:21:46,167
 Hey, David. It's Camille.

367
00:21:46,167 --> 00:21:50,133
 You know, when Dostoyevsky
 was writing The Gambler,

368
00:21:50,133 --> 00:21:52,067
 he signed a contract
 with his publisher

369
00:21:52,067 --> 00:21:55,567
 saying that he would
 finish it in 26 days.

370
00:21:55,567 --> 00:21:57,167
 And he did it,

371
00:21:57,167 --> 00:22:00,567
 but he had the help
 of this young stenographer.

372
00:22:00,567 --> 00:22:04,901
 This girl--
 she stayed with him,
 and she helped him.

373
00:22:04,901 --> 00:22:07,567
 And afterwards,

374
00:22:07,567 --> 00:22:10,100
 they actually got married.

375
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:12,434
 [chuckles]
 Isn't that cool?

376
00:22:12,434 --> 00:22:14,834
 That's how he met his wife.

377
00:22:14,834 --> 00:22:16,367
 Anyway, I found this story

378
00:22:16,367 --> 00:22:18,367
 in the preface
 for Crime and Punishment.

379
00:22:18,367 --> 00:22:21,734
 So I was thinking that--

380
00:22:21,734 --> 00:22:24,634
 And this would have to be
 between you and me.

381
00:22:24,634 --> 00:22:28,834
 But I was thinking that
 I could read the books

382
00:22:28,834 --> 00:22:30,834
 and tell you
 what's going on.

383
00:22:30,834 --> 00:22:33,767
 That way, you could just
 focus on your music.

384
00:22:33,767 --> 00:22:35,567
 But only if you're
 comfortable with this.

385
00:22:35,567 --> 00:22:38,334
 And if you're not, you know,
 we can just forget it,

386
00:22:38,334 --> 00:22:40,167
 and you can quit.

387
00:22:40,167 --> 00:22:43,367
 But if you are,

388
00:22:43,367 --> 00:22:46,434
 then open this door.

389
00:22:47,434 --> 00:22:51,100
Open...this door?

390
00:23:22,601 --> 00:23:24,901
Okay, a deal's a deal.

391
00:23:24,901 --> 00:23:27,133
Does this mean
we're getting married?

392
00:23:28,334 --> 00:23:30,667
I have a lot of reading to do.

393
00:23:34,734 --> 00:23:38,200
Hi. I'm Camille.

394
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:40,467
Hi. I'm David.

395
00:24:15,033 --> 00:24:16,667
[phone rings]

396
00:24:17,934 --> 00:24:19,767
Hello?

397
00:24:19,767 --> 00:24:21,467
Where?

398
00:25:25,367 --> 00:25:27,601
Thank you.

399
00:25:39,801 --> 00:25:44,033
That was kind of a powerful,
intimate situation.

400
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:46,701
What was intimate?

401
00:25:46,701 --> 00:25:49,400
Just now. Just-- We...

402
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:51,200
Sharing the flame.

403
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:53,467
I mean, that was--
that was intimate.

404
00:25:53,467 --> 00:25:54,601
If you say so.

405
00:25:54,601 --> 00:25:55,901
Oh, come on now.

406
00:25:55,901 --> 00:25:57,467
You know what I'm
talking about.

407
00:25:57,467 --> 00:25:59,234
Our hands almost touched.

408
00:25:59,234 --> 00:26:02,334
I looked at you, and you
lifted your head up slowly,

409
00:26:02,334 --> 00:26:03,567
and our eyes met.

410
00:26:03,567 --> 00:26:05,434
It was-- It was--
It was intense,

411
00:26:05,434 --> 00:26:06,834
and it was intimate.

412
00:26:06,834 --> 00:26:10,033
Wow. Stop it.
I feel naked.

413
00:26:10,033 --> 00:26:12,067
Yeah, well, you know what?
I have that effect on women.

414
00:26:12,067 --> 00:26:14,234
I mean, not all women.
No, not all women.
[laughs]

415
00:26:14,234 --> 00:26:16,334
But it has happened before,
so don't be alarmed.

416
00:26:16,334 --> 00:26:19,334
Yeah, I bet.
Yeah. Don't ignore
what's happening here.

417
00:26:19,334 --> 00:26:21,234
We're having some kind
of powerful, weird alchemy,

418
00:26:21,234 --> 00:26:23,133
and you have to pay attention
when that happens.

419
00:26:23,133 --> 00:26:26,300
This stuff is not
to be treated lightly.

420
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:28,033
Listen, I actually
just came out here

421
00:26:28,033 --> 00:26:29,634
to have a cigarette,
okay?

422
00:26:29,634 --> 00:26:31,968
And relax and do my thing.
Okay. No. Sure.
Sure. Yeah.

423
00:26:31,968 --> 00:26:34,000
So, uh,
maybe another time.

424
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,667
Yeah. But there may not
be another time. Okay?

425
00:26:36,667 --> 00:26:38,000
I may never get
this chance again.

426
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,701
I mean, we may never,
you know,

427
00:26:39,701 --> 00:26:42,133
be able to return
to this-- this moment.

428
00:26:42,133 --> 00:26:45,968
Well, then, you should know
that I'm married and happy.

429
00:26:45,968 --> 00:26:48,167
Right. Uh-huh.
And where is he?

430
00:26:48,167 --> 00:26:49,634
Huh? Huh?

431
00:26:49,634 --> 00:26:52,133
He leaves you out here alone,
in the dark, without a light.

432
00:26:52,133 --> 00:26:54,567
I'm not feeling that.
Well, he doesn't smoke, so--

433
00:26:54,567 --> 00:26:57,033
But you love him anyway.
Yeah. Why not?

434
00:26:57,033 --> 00:27:00,067
Sure. Sure.
He just abandons you, huh,

435
00:27:00,067 --> 00:27:03,334
to your mortal disease,
and leaves you alone to suffer

436
00:27:03,334 --> 00:27:05,467
and die, when he's in there
pretending to love you?

437
00:27:05,467 --> 00:27:08,000
I don't respect this guy.
I think he's a coward.

438
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,200
I think he's selfish.
And forgive me for saying this,

439
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:13,868
but I think any moment now,
this guy's gonna open up
his real self to you,

440
00:27:13,868 --> 00:27:15,200
and it's gonna be all--
[roars]

441
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:17,067
like, scary stuff's
gonna come out.

442
00:27:17,067 --> 00:27:18,400
You know,
I felt it right away.

443
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:21,400
I felt it right away--
that I think--

444
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:23,200
I'm gonna say something
a little bold here.

445
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:25,868
But I think you might
be married to the wrong person.

446
00:27:25,868 --> 00:27:28,501
I don't know that
even if that were true

447
00:27:28,501 --> 00:27:30,534
that I'd tell you.
Right.

448
00:27:30,534 --> 00:27:32,667
We're not exactly friends.
No, we're not.

449
00:27:32,667 --> 00:27:33,968
No.
That's true.

450
00:27:33,968 --> 00:27:35,534
But we did share a flame.
Right?

451
00:27:35,534 --> 00:27:37,100
Speaking of.
Oh.

452
00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:38,901
See? Look at that.
See? You need me.

453
00:27:38,901 --> 00:27:40,901
You're walking away,
and you need me.

454
00:27:40,901 --> 00:27:44,133
We share a flame.
Thousands of tiny molecules
are heating up right now.

455
00:27:44,133 --> 00:27:45,501
They're penetrating
our brain.

456
00:27:45,501 --> 00:27:47,534
They're stimulating
our sexual desire.

457
00:27:47,534 --> 00:27:50,334
I don't know about you,
but I find that shit
very romantic.

458
00:27:50,334 --> 00:27:52,133
And I'm so glad
you walked over here

459
00:27:52,133 --> 00:27:54,133
because now I can feel
a little bit more comfortable

460
00:27:54,133 --> 00:27:56,467
to tell you
that I happen to be,

461
00:27:56,467 --> 00:27:58,434
uh, on the forefront
of men

462
00:27:58,434 --> 00:28:01,501
able to find and locate
a woman's G-spot.

463
00:28:01,501 --> 00:28:03,434
And I could
do that for you.

464
00:28:03,434 --> 00:28:05,234
That's really generous
of you. Thank you.

465
00:28:05,234 --> 00:28:08,901
It's my pleasure.
Well, it's your pleasure.

466
00:28:08,901 --> 00:28:10,834
And what makes you think
I haven't located it yet?

467
00:28:10,834 --> 00:28:12,901
Um, the way you hold
the cigarette.

468
00:28:12,901 --> 00:28:15,200
It's a little high
and tight, you know?

469
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:17,033
What you have to do
is you have to lower it.

470
00:28:17,033 --> 00:28:20,901
You have to bring it
all the way down in there
so it just sits comfortably.

471
00:28:20,901 --> 00:28:23,234
It rests there.
If it's high
and tight like that,

472
00:28:23,234 --> 00:28:24,934
the whole body
gets restricted,

473
00:28:24,934 --> 00:28:27,334
and the plexus
gets closed off,

474
00:28:27,334 --> 00:28:30,434
you know, and the vagina
gets locked.

475
00:28:30,434 --> 00:28:33,634
Look, I just happen to know
this crazy, weird technique
with the vagina.

476
00:28:33,634 --> 00:28:35,701
It's kind of cool,
and I thought
you'd be interested.

477
00:28:35,701 --> 00:28:37,234
But you have to
be prepared.

478
00:28:37,234 --> 00:28:39,501
You know what I mean?
Preparation is the key.

479
00:28:39,501 --> 00:28:42,767
I mean, it starts
with a little walk.
Just a short walk, like...

480
00:28:42,767 --> 00:28:44,334
You know, like, to, uh--
like my apartment.

481
00:28:44,334 --> 00:28:47,334
It's a couple blocks from here.
And we would walk,

482
00:28:47,334 --> 00:28:50,400
and I would tell you
a few little elegant,
classy jokes.

483
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:51,634
You know, kind of getting us

484
00:28:51,634 --> 00:28:53,701
a little giggly,
a little silly.

485
00:28:53,701 --> 00:28:57,667
You know? And then we'd share
a glass of Burgundy.
Burgundy?

486
00:28:57,667 --> 00:28:58,968
Yeah.

487
00:28:58,968 --> 00:29:01,634
We'd bask
in the warm, gentle,

488
00:29:01,634 --> 00:29:03,767
romantic yet erotic
glow

489
00:29:03,767 --> 00:29:05,901
of, uh, my spacious loft.

490
00:29:05,901 --> 00:29:08,667
And then
I would undress you,

491
00:29:08,667 --> 00:29:10,400
and you would undress me.

492
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:13,334
We'd stand naked before
each other, and we'd kiss.

493
00:29:13,334 --> 00:29:15,901
I find-- I find kissing
a very helpful,

494
00:29:15,901 --> 00:29:18,167
sweet way to-- to relax.

495
00:29:18,167 --> 00:29:19,901
And then, maybe I would--
I would--

496
00:29:19,901 --> 00:29:21,467
I would bite your neck
a little bit.

497
00:29:21,467 --> 00:29:24,267
Not-- Not hard. Just gentle--
gentle little nibbles,

498
00:29:24,267 --> 00:29:26,467
like-- like a little kitty cat,
you know?

499
00:29:26,467 --> 00:29:29,167
And then--
And then you would feel

500
00:29:29,167 --> 00:29:32,167
my hands kind of descend
to your lower region,

501
00:29:32,167 --> 00:29:34,400
kind of, uh,
finding their way,

502
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:37,534
massaging the skin
around your clitoris,

503
00:29:37,534 --> 00:29:41,067
which would even
stimulate the arousal
even more.

504
00:29:41,067 --> 00:29:42,467
All the time,
I'm whispering

505
00:29:42,467 --> 00:29:45,100
delicate little poems
in your ear, you know?

506
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:47,634
And the blood
from your body

507
00:29:47,634 --> 00:29:51,167
is-- is rushing
to the wet internal walls,

508
00:29:51,167 --> 00:29:54,000
and my fingers
would slide effortlessly--

509
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:57,968
[laughing]
Are you an actor or something?

510
00:29:57,968 --> 00:29:59,567
Or a comedian?
You're a comedian.

511
00:29:59,567 --> 00:30:02,667
No. I, uh--
I'm kind of a writer.

512
00:30:02,667 --> 00:30:05,200
Oh, you're kind of a writer.
Yeah, kind of.

513
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:07,901
You know, what about you?
What do you do?

514
00:30:07,901 --> 00:30:11,100
I'm a hooker.

515
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:14,734
[stammering, laughing]
What exactly does that mean?

516
00:30:14,734 --> 00:30:17,767
That exactly means that people
pay to have sex with me.

517
00:30:17,767 --> 00:30:19,767
Mm-hmm.

518
00:30:19,767 --> 00:30:22,467
So, if I wanted
to, um...

519
00:30:22,467 --> 00:30:24,000
Here's my card.

520
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,133
It's got my number
and my Web site on it.

521
00:30:26,133 --> 00:30:28,434
So wow.
You're, uh...

522
00:30:28,434 --> 00:30:31,868
That's why you're--

 759 drugstores

539
00:31:57,434 --> 00:31:59,367
Like there's gonna
be other proms.

540
00:31:59,367 --> 00:32:00,934
Well, there's not
gonna be another prom.

She'll go to the prom
with you tonight.

 to see the innards
 of the subway system.

01:01:11,801 --> 01:01:13,334
That would be so weird,

879
01:01:13,334 --> 01:01:15,634
because then we're going
to see a green

880
01:01:15,634 --> 01:01:17,367
or any color all the time.

881
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:36,501
Why's that squirrel
chasing the other
squirrel?

882
01:01:36,501 --> 01:01:37,834
Because he loves her.

883
01:01:37,834 --> 01:01:40,367
Then why is she
running away?

884
01:01:40,367 --> 01:01:42,267
Because she's scared.

885
01:01:42,267 --> 01:01:44,000
Hmm. Can we go
to the fountain now?

886
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:49,801
The fountain?
I don't remember
where the fountain is.

887
01:01:49,801 --> 01:01:50,834

888

900
01:03:04,734 --> 01:03:06,000
how good you are with her.

901
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:08,267
Oh, thanks. Thank you.

902
01:03:08,267 --> 01:03:10,934
It's so unusual
to meet a manny.

903
01:03:10,934 --> 01:03:13,133
And a good manny,
at that.

904
01:03:13,133 --> 01:03:14,567
What?

905
01:03:14,567 --> 01:03:15,968
You know, a male nanny.

906
01:03:18,934 --> 01:03:22,501
Well, thank you. Thanks.

907
01:03:24,100 --> 01:03:26,601
Excuse me.
Teya.

908

Let's go now.

910
01:03:29,934 --> 01:03:32,901

I like when
they're both out.
Yeah?

916
01:03:45,434 --> 01:03:47,434
They make all these
pretty colors,

917
01:03:47,434 --> 01:03:53,434
and it's kind of like
purple, hot pink
and regular pink,

918
01:03:53,434 --> 01:03:57,501
and they sort of, like,
play tag with each other

919
01:03:57,501 --> 01:03:59,901
while they still can.

920
01:04:01,467 --> 01:04:02,701

Hi.

Did you pick that out
yourself?

925
01:04:11,968 --> 01:04:15,267
Yep. And the bracelet matches.

926
01:04:15,267 --> 01:04:16,801
It does.

927

He's got a snack
for you.

No, thanks.

You're going to get hungry.

930

Nuh-uh. I had a hot dog.

931
01:04:31,267 --> 01:04:33,667
You need to be firm
with her, okay?

932
01:04:33,667 --> 01:04:35,300
She needs the discipline.

933
01:04:35,300 --> 01:04:37,634
She needs you.

934
01:04:40,534 --> 01:04:43,133

again tomorrow?

Okay.

01:18:27,501 --> 01:18:28,667
No underwear?

1061
01:18:28,667 --> 01:18:29,801
Not today.

1062
01:18:38,167 --> 01:18:40,834
I feel sad for this
poor, lonely husband

1063
01:18:40,834 --> 01:18:43,667
who can't see his wife's
hidden talents.

1064
01:18:43,667 --> 01:18:47,033
Don't you think he's like
every man, though?

1065
01:18:47,033 --> 01:18:50,334
He's typically
blind and bored by
his very own wife,

1066
01:18:50,334 --> 01:18:53,200
ready to fantasize about
the first unknown woman

1067
01:18:53,200 --> 01:18:54,868
he hasn't fucked yet.

1068
01:18:57,868 --> 01:18:59,267
Am I bothering you?

1069
01:19:01,868 --> 01:19:03,033
Not at all.

1070
01:19:04,667 --> 01:19:10,000
Yeah. And you say that because
now I've turned you on, right?

1071
01:19:11,334 --> 01:19:13,767
You want
to take me to bed.

1072
01:19:16,234 --> 01:19:19,567
Do you want
to take me to bed?

1073
01:19:19,567 --> 01:19:24,234
Yeah, I probably do.

1074
01:19:24,234 --> 01:19:29,234
Aw, come on. All right,
why are you telling me
all of this?

1075
01:19:29,234 --> 01:19:32,067
Because tonight
I want things
to change.

1076
01:19:34,901 --> 01:19:37,234
Chain smoking's
a bad thing.

1077
01:19:37,234 --> 01:19:39,534
Who knows?
Maybe we'll meet again.

1078
01:20:10,601 --> 01:20:11,534
Thank you.

1079
01:20:12,734 --> 01:20:15,968
Enjoy your meal.

1080
01:20:26,434 --> 01:20:27,367
[sighs]

1081
01:20:37,968 --> 01:20:39,868
I love you.

1082
01:20:42,634 --> 01:20:44,033
I love you, too.

1083
01:20:49,634 --> 01:20:50,567
Okay?

1084
01:21:02,834 --> 01:21:08,667
 § A heart that's full up §

1085
01:21:08,667 --> 01:21:12,467
 § Like a landfill §

1086

[no audible dialogue]

1089
01:21:32,367 --> 01:21:34,033
What the hell
happened to you?

1090
01:21:34,033 --> 01:21:35,200
I was doing downward dog,

1091
01:21:35,200 --> 01:21:36,434
and then I went
into chakrasana,

1092
01:21:36,434 --> 01:21:37,934
and that's when it happened.

1093
01:21:39,200 --> 01:21:40,667
What's a downward dog?

1094
01:21:40,667 --> 01:21:42,234
Yoga.

1095
01:21:42,234 --> 01:21:43,834
Oh, yeah. You know,

1096
01:21:43,834 --> 01:21:46,200
I remember you used to be
really loose and limber.

1097
01:21:46,200 --> 01:21:47,934
Mr. Riccoli, can you just
fill the prescriptions now?

1098
01:21:47,934 --> 01:21:50,200
I didn't mean loose like--
I know what you're saying.

1099
01:21:50,200 --> 01:21:52,567
I just have somewhere to be.

1100
01:21:52,567 --> 01:21:54,701
Right.

1101
01:21:54,701 --> 01:21:59,234
Um...

1102
01:21:59,234 --> 01:22:01,367
What the hell--
Who you with?

1103
01:22:01,367 --> 01:22:03,400
Birth control?
What the hell
are you doing?

1104
01:22:03,400 --> 01:22:04,501
Oh, come on.

1105
01:22:04,501 --> 01:22:06,133
No, listen,
I'm just saying that,

1106
01:22:06,133 --> 01:22:07,701
you know, I think, Lydia,

1107
01:22:07,701 --> 01:22:09,934
personally it's time
for you to have babies.

1108
01:22:09,934 --> 01:22:12,300
What are you, kidding me?

1109
01:22:12,300 --> 01:22:14,601
What's wrong with you?
I'm out of here.

1110
01:22:14,601 --> 01:22:15,567
What'd I say?

1111
01:22:16,801 --> 01:22:18,601
What did I--

1112
01:22:18,601 --> 01:22:20,601
You used to be nice.
What happened to you?

1113
01:22:20,601 --> 01:22:22,234
Whoa.

1114
01:22:24,234 --> 01:22:27,601
Hey, Lydia, come on.
Talk to me. What'd I say?

1115
01:22:27,601 --> 01:22:29,534
Hey, I'm sorry.

1116
01:22:31,701 --> 01:22:34,067
What the hell did I say?

1117
01:22:34,067 --> 01:22:35,234
Babies.

1118
01:22:39,434 --> 01:22:41,067
[Man]
You're picking on me again.

1119
01:22:41,067 --> 01:22:43,434
[Woman]
I just don't understand
why I'm always the one

1120
01:22:43,434 --> 01:22:45,601
who has to initiate
everything.

1121
01:22:45,601 --> 01:22:47,067
Not true.

1122
01:22:47,067 --> 01:22:48,434
We don't go anywhere.

1123
01:22:48,434 --> 01:22:50,567
You don't take me
anywhere.

1124
01:22:50,567 --> 01:22:52,567
I took you to
the park last week.

1125
01:22:52,567 --> 01:22:54,567
Come on. I'm talking about
outside of the city.

1126
01:22:54,567 --> 01:22:56,567
Name one place
in the past two years

1127
01:22:56,567 --> 01:22:59,100
outside the city that
you've taken me to.

1128
01:22:59,100 --> 01:23:00,734
Beach in the Hamptons.

1129
01:23:00,734 --> 01:23:02,567
That's where we met,
and you hated the Hamptons.

1130
01:23:02,567 --> 01:23:04,567
I'm talking about
a road trip,

1131
01:23:04,567 --> 01:23:08,267
or a canoe trip, even.
A bike trip.

1132
01:23:08,267 --> 01:23:10,300
Will you stop
with the phone?

1133
01:23:11,801 --> 01:23:15,334
Just name one.

1134
01:23:15,334 --> 01:23:16,367
Exactly.

1135
01:23:17,801 --> 01:23:19,467
What?

1136
01:23:19,467 --> 01:23:21,701
If you could go
anywhere in the world,

1137
01:23:21,701 --> 01:23:24,667
where would you go?

1138
01:23:24,667 --> 01:23:27,467
You know where.

1139
01:23:27,467 --> 01:23:29,601
Come with me.
What are you doing?

1140
01:23:29,601 --> 01:23:32,734
I just bought tickets.
We're leaving now.

1141
01:23:35,334 --> 01:23:36,434
We are?

1142
01:23:38,400 --> 01:23:40,133
Are you out of your mind?

1143
01:23:40,133 --> 01:23:41,601
I don't have anything
with me right now.

1144
01:23:41,601 --> 01:23:43,834
Well, I will buy you
a toothbrush.

1145
01:23:43,834 --> 01:23:45,167
In Rome.

1146
01:23:48,100 --> 01:23:50,267
Coach is fine.

1147
01:23:54,701 --> 01:23:56,334
Lift your feet.

1148
01:23:56,334 --> 01:23:57,834
You don't lift
your feet.

1149
01:23:57,834 --> 01:23:59,167
I'm lifting my feet.

1150
01:23:59,167 --> 01:24:00,501
No, you're shuffling.

1151
01:24:00,501 --> 01:24:03,167
The doctor said
you should lift
your feet.

1152
01:24:03,167 --> 01:24:04,968
I'm lifting, I'm lifting.

1153
01:24:04,968 --> 01:24:08,634
You want you should fall down,
break your other hip?

1154
01:24:08,634 --> 01:24:12,167
At least then the pain would
be the same on both sides.

1155
01:24:12,167 --> 01:24:16,200
Equal.
Everything always has to
be equal with you.

1156
01:24:16,200 --> 01:24:18,667
I'm a democratic
sort of fellow.

1157
01:24:18,667 --> 01:24:20,300
Well, see how
democratic you feel

1158
01:24:20,300 --> 01:24:22,534
when you fall down
and break your other hip.

1159
01:24:22,534 --> 01:24:24,667
I'm not breaking any hips.

1160
01:24:24,667 --> 01:24:27,868
Is there some place
you got to get to later?

1161
01:24:27,868 --> 01:24:30,000
What is your hurry?

1162
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:32,868
My hurry is
I want to get there
before next week.

1163
01:24:32,868 --> 01:24:34,868
At the rate you walk...

1164
01:24:34,868 --> 01:24:36,434
You want faster?

1165
01:24:36,434 --> 01:24:40,200
Divorce me and get yourself
a younger man.

1166
01:24:40,200 --> 01:24:42,868
Tom Cruise, perhaps.

1167
01:24:42,868 --> 01:24:45,734
You think you're funny?

1168
01:24:45,734 --> 01:24:48,667
I do, as a matter of fact.

1169
01:24:48,667 --> 01:24:51,234
Then what would you do,
Mr. Smarty-pants?

1170
01:24:51,234 --> 01:24:53,534
Mr. I'm so independent,

1171
01:24:53,534 --> 01:24:56,767
I don't need any help
opening the pickle jar.

1172
01:24:56,767 --> 01:24:58,501
I got caught in a pickle.

1173
01:24:58,501 --> 01:25:03,200
You'd still be
putting on your jacket
if it wasn't for me.

1174
01:25:03,200 --> 01:25:04,334
[horn honks]

1175
01:25:05,567 --> 01:25:07,567
Go ahead, hit me,
why don't you?

1176
01:25:07,567 --> 01:25:09,667
Want to run me down?
[scoffs]

1177
01:25:09,667 --> 01:25:12,767
All the time, honking like
they own the place.

1178
01:25:12,767 --> 01:25:14,234
We could have driven.

1179
01:25:14,234 --> 01:25:15,567
Who could have driven? You?

1180
01:25:15,567 --> 01:25:18,300
You're going to give me
a heart attack now?

1181
01:25:18,300 --> 01:25:19,901
What's the good
of having a car

1182
01:25:19,901 --> 01:25:21,701
if I never get
to drive it?

1183
01:25:21,701 --> 01:25:24,267
You can't drive.
You can't even
read the street sign.

1184
01:25:24,267 --> 01:25:26,267
I still have my license.

1185
01:25:26,267 --> 01:25:28,133
Only because
that girl at the DMV

1186
01:25:28,133 --> 01:25:29,267
took pity on you.

1187
01:25:29,267 --> 01:25:30,801
All that flirting
with her, oh.

1188
01:25:30,801 --> 01:25:32,467
It was embarrassing.

1189
01:25:32,467 --> 01:25:35,067
Brighton Beach Avenue.

1190
01:25:35,067 --> 01:25:37,734
As if you didn't know
what street this was.

1191
01:25:37,734 --> 01:25:40,234
I know what street this is.
Of course you know
what street this is.

1192
01:25:40,234 --> 01:25:43,934
You think I don't know
what street this is?
Did I say you didn't?

1193
01:25:43,934 --> 01:25:46,601
I was reading the street sign.

1194
01:25:46,601 --> 01:25:49,267
A regular Evelyn Wood
I married.

1195
01:25:49,267 --> 01:25:51,400
Hurry up, it's green.

1196
01:25:58,300 --> 01:26:00,868
The light's going to change.

1197
01:26:19,667 --> 01:26:21,467
Step up.

1198
01:26:23,968 --> 01:26:25,300
Okay.

1199
01:26:25,300 --> 01:26:27,834
You sure?
We're not in any rush.

1200
01:26:27,834 --> 01:26:29,968
I said I'm okay.

1201
01:26:33,067 --> 01:26:35,667
Don't walk so fast.

1202
01:26:35,667 --> 01:26:38,133
I don't want to have to
call an ambulance.

1203
01:26:38,133 --> 01:26:42,000
I don't want to think about
trying to make that cell phone
she sent us work.

1204
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:43,701
Did you call her?

1205
01:26:43,701 --> 01:26:44,968
She called me.

1206
01:26:44,968 --> 01:26:46,868
What did she say?
What do you think she said?

1207
01:26:46,868 --> 01:26:50,334
"How are you? How is Dad?
What are you doing?"

1208
01:26:50,334 --> 01:26:52,801
And what did you
say to her?

1209
01:26:52,801 --> 01:26:56,000
I told her we're doing
the same thing we do
every year.

1210
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:57,501
Good.

1211
01:26:57,501 --> 01:27:00,667
She said she sent us
a card, and did we get it.

1212
01:27:00,667 --> 01:27:03,501
Did we get a card?
Did you see any card?

1213
01:27:03,501 --> 01:27:07,033
Maybe it just
didn't get here yet.

1214
01:27:07,033 --> 01:27:08,300
She probably sent it late.

1215
01:27:08,300 --> 01:27:11,367
Don't criticize.
I'm not criticizing.

1216
01:27:11,367 --> 01:27:12,701
You are criticizing.

1217
01:27:12,701 --> 01:27:14,467
I'm just saying,
she probably forgot

1218
01:27:14,467 --> 01:27:16,200
and then remembered
at the last minute.

1219
01:27:16,200 --> 01:27:17,367
You wait and see.

1220
01:27:17,367 --> 01:27:19,000
The postmark
will be yesterday,

1221
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:24,033
as if it could get here
from France in one day.

1222
01:27:24,033 --> 01:27:25,701
Where are you going?

1223
01:27:25,701 --> 01:27:27,300
I don't want
to take the ramp.

1224
01:27:27,300 --> 01:27:29,033
Well, the ramp is easier.

1225
01:27:29,033 --> 01:27:30,200
I'll take the stairs.

1226
01:27:30,200 --> 01:27:32,934
You're going to kill me.
[sighs]

1227
01:27:35,167 --> 01:27:38,734
Today of all days, he decides
he'll finally kill me--

1228
01:27:38,734 --> 01:27:41,067
Do away with me by making me
take the stairs.

1229
01:27:41,067 --> 01:27:43,434
Give me a heart attack,

1230
01:27:43,434 --> 01:27:46,133
just watching you
take the stairs.

1231
01:27:46,133 --> 01:27:49,067
They have smart police
these days,

1232
01:27:49,067 --> 01:27:51,701
like the cute one on CSI.

1233
01:27:53,400 --> 01:27:55,400
They'll figure it out.

1234
01:27:55,400 --> 01:27:56,734
It'll make headlines--

1235
01:27:56,734 --> 01:28:02,067
Man kills wife
on 63rd anniversary,

1236
01:28:02,067 --> 01:28:05,801
walking up stairs.
[grunts]

1237
01:29:21,834 --> 01:29:22,968
[wheels rattle over boardwalk]

1238
01:29:25,033 --> 01:29:26,133
Hey, hey!

1239
01:29:26,133 --> 01:29:27,167
Hoodlums!

1240
01:29:27,167 --> 01:29:31,033
 They ought to arrest them.

1241
01:29:31,033 --> 01:29:33,167
Let's go have lunch.

1242
01:29:33,167 --> 01:29:34,167
Let's go. Come on.

1243
01:29:34,167 --> 01:29:35,334
Let's go.

1244
01:29:35,334 --> 01:29:36,968
I'm coming,
I'm coming.

1245
01:29:38,167 --> 01:29:39,501
Lift your feet.

1246
01:29:39,501 --> 01:29:40,968
I'm lifting.
No, you're shuffling.

1247
01:29:40,968 --> 01:29:44,033
Lift your feet. Lift.
I'm lifting, I'm lifting.

1248
01:29:44,033 --> 01:29:44,968
All right. Come on.

1249
01:29:47,167 --> 01:29:51,000
I fixed your hat
a little bit.

1250
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:53,067
You're looking okay
with your hat.

1251
01:29:53,067 --> 01:29:54,000
Yeah.

1252
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:57,834
Looking pretty
good-looking to me.

1253
01:30:27,901 --> 01:30:29,567
[Man]
Look at me.

1254
01:30:29,567 --> 01:30:31,133
Look at me.

1255
01:30:31,133 --> 01:30:34,067
I look terrible.

1256
01:30:34,067 --> 01:30:37,234
I don't understand
what happened.

1257
01:30:37,234 --> 01:30:41,167
Happened. What happened?

1258
01:31:06,267 --> 01:31:09,067
[no audible dialogue]
