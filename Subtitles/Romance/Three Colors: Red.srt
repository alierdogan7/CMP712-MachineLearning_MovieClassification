1
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:47,480
THREE COLOURS
WHITE

2
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:37,960
I have paper... a summons.

3
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:40,440
That way, sir.

4
00:02:55,760 --> 00:03:00,080
Can you tell us your concrete
reasons for wanting a divorce?

5
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:04,160
Concrete?

6
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,960
Yes, concrete.

7
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:16,760
Our marriage wasn't consummated.

8
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:25,960
Is your wife's testimony
faithful to the facts?

9
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:34,960
In a matter of speaking.

10
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:45,560
But when we met in Poland,

11
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:49,440
and even here, at the beginning,
I think I gave my wife pleasure.

12
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:53,840
It's only afterwards...

13
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:08,840
We haven't made love
since we're married.

14
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:12,480
We stopped... I stopped being
able to. It's just temporary.

15
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:23,760
Where's the equality?

16
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:28,560
Is my not speaking French
a reason for the court to refuse

17
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:30,920
to hear my case?

18
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:32,760
What is it

19
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:34,760
that you want?

20
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:41,760
I need time, Your Honor.

21
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:49,920
I want to save our marriage.

22
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,560
I don't believe
the love is gone.

23
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:02,240
One night I was ready to

24
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:10,240
Was the marriage consummated
that night?

25
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:20,160
No.

26
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,560
Pardon?

27
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:41,160
Do you love your husband?

28
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:45,160
I used to.

29
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:49,680
and now?

30
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:56,880
No.

31
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:00,960
I don't love him anymore.

32
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,960
My god.

33
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:02,160
That's all.

34
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,960
Dominique!

35
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:55,960
ENTER YOUR CODE,
THEN PRESS "VALIDATE"

36
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:12,960
CARD CONFISCATED

37
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:15,280
CAROL, CAROL.

38
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:16,960
Your account is frozen.

39
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:18,960
blocked?

40
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:20,760
Yes, your card cannot be used.

41
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:22,960
It's invalidated. Canceled.

42
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:25,880
My card.

43
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:28,480
I can't give it to you.

44
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:34,960
My money.

45
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,200
Police?

46
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:40,440
No, No.

47
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,440
Please.

48
00:12:36,080 --> 00:10:36,880
Well...?

49
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:39,200
Excuse me.

50
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:45,000
Come to Poland with me.

51
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:47,920
I'll never go with you.

52
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:49,720
I'll win

53
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:51,520
every trial.

54
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:54,320
the divorce,
property settlement...

55
00:12:58,040 --> 00:12:59,760
You never understood a thing.

56
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:03,240
I understand.

57
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:04,760
No.

58
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:09,880
If I say I love you,
you don't understand

59
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:13,480
And if I say I hate you,
you still dont understand.

60
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:17,800
You don't understand
that I want you,

61
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:20,280
that I need you.

62
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:22,800
Do you understand?

63
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:24,680
Do you understand?

64
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,200
No.

65
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:30,800
And now I scare you?

66
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:33,520
Do I scare you?

67
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:36,240
I don't know.

68
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,920
You don't know...

69
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,840
Watch this, now.

70
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,840
Take a good look.

71
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:55,880
You were out for revenge.

72
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,880
You set the place on fire.

73
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:08,880
Soon every cop in Paris
will be after you.

74
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,920
The keys.

75
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:26,080
Your fly is open.

76
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:30,680
I am sorry.

77
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:35,400
How could you tell
I am polish?

78
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:37,120
I know that song.

79
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:39,240
How about this one?

80
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:44,720
I don't like it.

81
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:50,120
Do you live off that comb?

82
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:52,840
I try.
Times are tough.

83
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:55,720
What's that?

84
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:56,840
Diplomas.

85
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:05,160
Hairdresser?

86
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:08,480
Not a bad job.

87
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:12,200
I've won competitions.

88
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:13,960
Sofia, Budapest, Warshaw.

89
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:17,200
Here too.

90
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:20,800
Where do you sleep?

91
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:23,200
In your suitcase?

92
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:28,240
Excuse me.

93
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:31,240
Mikolaj.

94
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:38,240
There's an alcove...

95
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:02,800
Can I sit with you
for a while?

96
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:26,080
Do you do card tricks?

97
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:28,320
Pick thirteen cards.

98
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:41,680
Spades: 3, 4, Queen, King.

99
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,400
Diamonds: 2, 5, Ace.

100
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:47,400
Clubs: 3, 5, King.

101
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:51,920
Hearts are weak: 2 and 4.

102
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:55,920
What counts in bridge
is memory.

103
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:58,440
And mine is excellent.

104
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:04,960
I've played bridge here
for a few years.

105
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:07,440
Now I am going home.
What about you?

106
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:15,480
I want to get out of here.

107
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:23,480
I'll take you back.

108
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:24,760
Tomorrow morning.

109
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:29,520
I think I doubt it.

110
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:34,520
I lost my passport. I have no
money. The police are after me.

111
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:39,520
I'm down on my luck.

112
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:45,520
I'll make enough to buy a fake
passport near the Polish church.

113
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:48,560
They're rip-off artists.

114
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:50,560
And not very serious.

115
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:54,560
I offered one of them a job.
He took the money and ran.

116
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:57,240
Maybe you'll like it.

117
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:59,760
A good job?

118
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:02,560
Very good, but unpleasant.

119
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:05,560
I'm hairdresser.

120
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,680
You have to kill someone.

121
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:16,560
He won't do it himself.

122
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:19,560
He doesn't want to go on living.

123
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:21,560
A Pole.

124
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:25,640
He'll pay well.
Enough to live on for 6 months.

125
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:32,800
No, no... not that.

126
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:35,160
Why can't he do it himself?

127
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:42,680
He has a wife and children
who love him.

128
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:46,320
Imagine how they would feel.

129
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:48,680
This way, someone kills him
and it's over.

130
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:51,680
He has a wife, children, money...
and wants to die?

131
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:56,680
What can I say?

132
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:00,920
My wife threw me out
with one suitcase.

133
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:02,720
And here I am.

134
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:07,720
And i still love her.

135
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:10,720
Even more than before.

136
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:13,240
After all she did,
I still love her.

137
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:14,720
Is she pretty?

138
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:19,760
Beautiful.

139
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:25,280
I first saw her at the
Budapest competition.

140
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:27,280
I won that.

141
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:28,760
A friend was doing her hair.

142
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:32,800
She looked at me.

143
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:40,280
I'll show you.

144
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:41,800
Where?

145
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:43,800
Come on.

146
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:52,800
Brigitte Bardot?

147
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:54,320
Beautiful.

148
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:56,040
A bit over the hill, no?

149
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:57,040
There.

150
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:11,880
She's going to sleep.

151
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:20,880
You think so?

152
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:57,960
It's me.

153
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:02,000
Perfect timing. listen.

154
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,040
Dominique, I love you.

155
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:02,640
It stole 2 francs.

156
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:07,120
Your telephone stole 2 francs.

157
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:08,120
So what?

158
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:11,120
Give me back my stolen money

159
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:12,640
Give it back!

160
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,200
You're taking me to Poland.

161
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:38,200
I know how.

162
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:40,120
How?

163
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:42,200
Move your arm.

164
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:04,480
For Air.

165
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:09,280
Can you last four hours?

166
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:11,280
I'll last.

167
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:13,880
I have one thing to do.

168
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:15,280
What?

169
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:17,280
Steal Something.

170
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:18,560
Nothing else from Paris?

171
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:19,560
No why?

172
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:24,560
Can I help you?

173
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:29,600
My suitcase is missing.

174
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:30,600
Ticket, please.

175
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:31,600
Excuse me?

176
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:33,600
Your ticket, please.

177
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:40,600
The Paris flight?

178
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:43,240
What was in it?

179
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:45,640
Personal belongings.

180
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:47,240
Clothes, shirts...

181
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:49,440
165 pounds?

182
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:56,640
To tell the truth,
my friend was in it.

183
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:42,240
We'll divide it in 5 equal parts:
2 for me.

184
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:43,760
What?

185
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:46,280
Handling charges.

186
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:50,760
Fuck! It's alive!

187
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:53,800
What the fuck?

188
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,800
Get him out!

189
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:07,800
Made in Russia! Fuck!

190
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:10,840
Stop it!
He may have a wallet.

191
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:23,840
Two francs! shit!

192
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:26,440
Give that back!

193
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:28,880
Careful he has scissors.

194
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:43,680
The asshole's broke.

195
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:45,920
Let's split.

196
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,000
Jesus...

197
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:32,000
Home at last.

198
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:37,960
Jesus!

199
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:39,360
You are back!

200
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:42,360
What happened?

201
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:44,160
You bought a new sign.

202
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:46,080
This is Europe now.

203
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:49,080
Too bad
you missed Christmas.

204
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:50,280
Too bad.

205
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:57,200
Just a minute, please.

206
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:06,200
Jurek.

207
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:07,440
I heard Karol's back.

208
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:09,120
Well...

209
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:10,640
he is.

210
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:25,480
So?

211
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:30,280
They're asking for you.

212
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:32,280
The ladies.

213
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:33,680
Give me a few days.

214
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:35,880
I brought you some broth.

215
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:45,520
Sleep.

216
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:49,920
Sleep, sleep...

217
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:20,720
Karol, remember you have
an appointment today.

218
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:22,720
Thank you.

219
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:26,320
What's up?

220
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:33,560
What is it?

221
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:35,760
It's payday.

222
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:39,760
You have clients waiting.

223
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:42,080
I can't today.
You do them.

224
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:43,920
They don't want me anymore.

225
00:33:58,600 --> 00:33:59,800
The door!

226
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:03,320
Sorry.

227
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:05,120
What is it?

228
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:07,840
I have an appointment.
Jadwiga told me...

229
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:10,640
You do her hair?

230
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:11,640
Yes.

231
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:13,160
Is that all?

232
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:17,640
Okay.

233
00:34:17,640 --> 00:34:19,160
What do you want?

234
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:21,880
I'd like to get
into the money business.

235
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:25,280
In my line,
it takes years to get ahead.

236
00:34:25,640 --> 00:34:27,160
I'll say.

237
00:34:27,640 --> 00:34:29,880
I heard about
how you got out of Paris.

238
00:34:33,640 --> 00:34:35,640
You're inconspicuous.

239
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:40,920
That's good.
I need a guard.

240
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:44,640
Relax.
It just shoots tear-gas.

241
00:34:48,640 --> 00:34:50,640
Go wander around outside.

242
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:37,320
Present perfect.

243
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:39,840
I have eaten. You have eaten.
He has eaten.

244
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:42,840
We have eaten. You have eaten.
They has eaten.

245
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:44,960
Repeat:

246
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:49,880
Would that I had eaten!

247
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:51,880
Would that you had eaten...

248
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,640
The verb "to sleep".

249
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:06,400
Repeat:

250
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:08,160
Would that I had slept.

251
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:09,920
Would that you had slept...

252
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:21,920
The verb "to leave"

253
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:24,960
Repeat: ...

254
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:39,960
The verb "to please".
Repeat: ...

255
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
How about a gas mask?

256
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,040
What?

257
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:01,520
-Someone is watching us.
-Let him.

258
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:03,920
A big guy. Just standing there.

259
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:09,040
Where?

260
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:20,080
Hide me.

261
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:22,560
Hide me!

262
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:28,080
Are you happy here?

263
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:30,280
In the bathroom?

264
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:32,600
No, in general.

265
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:34,800
Yes. Why?

266
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:37,120
You can stay as long
as you like,

267
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:39,600
but we have to settle things
first.

268
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:42,120
I can pay you.

269
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:43,160
No.

270
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:46,440
I'd like you
to do some hair.

271
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:48,520
Ten heads.

272
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:51,840
A week.

273
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:53,440
Five.

274
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:56,160
Okay. Seven.

275
00:37:57,160 --> 00:37:59,160
Someone was looking for you.

276
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:03,160
Not too tall. Fortyish.

277
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:05,160
Sad looking.

278
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:07,160
Mikolaj?

279
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:12,400
He brought me back
from Paris.

280
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:15,160
He was glad to know
you're alive.

281
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:16,880
No phone number?

282
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:20,160
No, he just said to say hi.

283
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:22,160
Then he left.

284
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:25,640
Hi.

285
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:43,760
In Gdansk,
we exchange at 30.

286
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:46,280
In Torun, twice that.
Put it in a bank

287
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:48,280
and get a loan.

288
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:51,280
You have to turn here.

289
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:55,280
It's up the hill.

290
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:59,280
Only 7%.

291
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:02,320
But if we triple the investment...

292
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:04,320
That's pretty smart.

293
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:17,440
Is that clod sleeping?

294
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:27,880
It's here.

295
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:30,360
Hartwig and Ikea.

296
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:32,360
want to build warehouses.

297
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:39,080
And these bumpkins

298
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:40,800
don't know.

299
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:43,400
No one does.

300
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:45,600
I am not breathing a word.

301
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:47,400
30% profit.

302
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:53,400
We'll see.

303
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:54,640
Okay.

304
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:03,640
Don't sleep!

305
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:05,440
You'll get robbed.

306
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:12,480
Can you exchange this?

307
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:14,480
For dollars?

308
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:16,160
That's some nest egg.

309
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:17,760
I work.

310
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:32,520
A bottle of vodka.

311
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:34,520
The most expensive.

312
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:39,040
Wrap it up please.

313
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:02,880
Hello.

314
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:08,600
I'm here on business.

315
00:41:09,640 --> 00:41:11,080
Official?

316
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:13,600
No, I wanted to talk business.

317
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:17,600
Can I come in?

318
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:46,640
It must be a good piece of land.

319
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:48,360
Move in with your son!

320
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:49,640
I wanted it to.

321
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:50,640
Then do it!

322
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:52,640
Buy a car, a TV.

323
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:55,640
What for? I never watch it.

324
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:58,640
Always the same crap.

325
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:04,120
Or else...

326
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:05,920
I could bury the money or...

327
00:42:06,120 --> 00:42:07,640
put it in a little jar.

328
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:09,640
Sure!

329
00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:12,320
That would be nice.

330
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:14,160
1000 dollars down.

331
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:17,960
4000 more
when we close the deal.

332
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:48,000
I have to go.

333
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:49,120
What?

334
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:51,160
It's the last train.

335
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:53,320
You're wandering around
at night?

336
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:55,840
You'll get mugged.
They'll steal your briefcase.

337
00:42:56,120 --> 00:42:58,840
Sleep here.
There's a bed upstairs.

338
00:43:00,040 --> 00:43:01,840
It's your bed now.

339
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:04,440
Hello.

340
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:06,120
Hello.

341
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:08,920
You're alive.

342
00:45:09,320 --> 00:45:10,640
They stole me with the trunk.

343
00:45:12,360 --> 00:45:14,160
Your brother told me.

344
00:45:14,360 --> 00:45:16,360
I was looking for you.

345
00:45:16,440 --> 00:45:17,560
Me too.

346
00:45:20,360 --> 00:45:21,360
Well...

347
00:45:22,360 --> 00:45:23,360
What's up?

348
00:45:28,360 --> 00:45:30,680
In the metro,
you mentioned a guy...

349
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:32,200
Remember?

350
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:36,400
Can you get in touch with him?

351
00:45:36,600 --> 00:45:38,200
Yes, I can.

352
00:45:38,320 --> 00:45:41,200
When someone asks for help,
you have to help him. Right?

353
00:45:44,600 --> 00:45:45,600
Except...

354
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:48,240
he's back in Warsaw.

355
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:52,240
He doesn't want to anymore?

356
00:45:56,240 --> 00:45:57,560
He does.

357
00:45:57,760 --> 00:45:59,240
More than ever.

358
00:47:24,840 --> 00:47:25,760
So?

359
00:47:27,640 --> 00:47:29,160
He changed his mind?

360
00:47:30,440 --> 00:47:31,440
No.

361
00:47:31,640 --> 00:47:34,160
It's me.

362
00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:37,680
Does it make a difference?

363
00:47:39,480 --> 00:47:40,280
No...

364
00:47:41,680 --> 00:47:43,200
but it's you.

365
00:47:43,480 --> 00:47:44,480
How?

366
00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:54,120
These days

367
00:47:55,520 --> 00:47:57,200
you can buy anything.

368
00:47:58,720 --> 00:48:01,240
The envelope is in my pocket.

369
00:48:03,720 --> 00:48:06,240
Take it afterwards.

370
00:48:12,040 --> 00:48:13,240
Go on.

371
00:48:19,880 --> 00:48:21,560
Are you sure?

372
00:49:07,880 --> 00:49:09,680
That was a blank.

373
00:49:11,880 --> 00:49:14,680
the next one is real.

374
00:49:18,920 --> 00:49:20,720
Are you sure?

375
00:49:25,400 --> 00:49:27,040
Are you sure?

376
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:36,760
Not any more.

377
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:55,800
Tell me why.

378
00:50:03,120 --> 00:50:04,120
Mikolaj,

379
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:08,800
we all know pain.

380
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:11,840
Yes, but...

381
00:50:12,320 --> 00:50:14,120
I wanted less of it.

382
00:50:22,040 --> 00:50:23,840
The deal stands.

383
00:50:25,840 --> 00:50:28,040
Take it, you've earned it.

384
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:34,880
I did earn it.

385
00:50:35,960 --> 00:50:37,880
But consider it a loan.

386
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:40,880
How about a drink?

387
00:51:11,160 --> 00:51:13,160
I feel like a kid again!

388
00:51:15,160 --> 00:51:16,480
Me too.

389
00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:23,200
Everything is possible.

390
00:52:48,360 --> 00:51:50,240
You beat us to it.

391
00:52:50,480 --> 00:51:51,960
You bought the land.

392
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:08,240
Strangle him.

393
00:53:16,440 --> 00:53:17,240
You spied.

394
00:53:20,440 --> 00:53:21,760
I did.

395
00:53:22,440 --> 00:53:23,760
I have a will.

396
00:53:27,480 --> 00:53:29,280
And it's airtight.

397
00:53:31,480 --> 00:53:33,800
What do you mean "airtight"?

398
00:53:34,480 --> 00:53:36,800
If I die,
everything goes to the church.

399
00:53:38,480 --> 00:53:39,800
Jesus!

400
00:53:41,480 --> 00:53:42,800
To the church.

401
00:53:44,520 --> 00:53:46,800
We're screwed
Let him go.

402
00:53:52,520 --> 00:53:54,840
You're lucky
the stove's not lit.

403
00:54:05,560 --> 00:54:07,360
Let's talk.

404
00:54:15,560 --> 00:54:17,400
Are you selling?

405
00:54:19,600 --> 00:54:21,400
I'm selling.

406
00:54:21,600 --> 00:54:23,400
He's selling.

407
00:54:23,600 --> 00:54:25,080
How much?

408
00:54:26,600 --> 00:54:28,400
Ten times what I paid.

409
00:54:28,600 --> 00:54:31,400
50,000 dollars.

410
00:54:36,640 --> 00:54:38,440
Excuse me while I change.

411
00:54:44,560 --> 00:54:46,240
What a low-life.

412
00:55:03,680 --> 00:55:05,480
What the hell is going on?

413
00:55:06,480 --> 00:55:08,480
I'll be able to pay you back.

414
00:55:08,680 --> 00:55:09,680
The stove...?

415
00:55:14,520 --> 00:55:16,720
Should I light the stove?

416
00:55:16,720 --> 00:55:18,520
Later.

417
00:55:19,720 --> 00:55:21,720
This may interest you.

418
00:55:21,720 --> 00:55:23,520
I have a plot here.

419
00:55:24,720 --> 00:55:26,520
Here... and here.

420
00:55:26,720 --> 00:55:28,040
Right in the middle!

421
00:55:28,560 --> 00:55:29,160
Exactly.

422
00:55:29,240 --> 00:55:31,760
Here, I couldn't resist.
A beautiful spot.

423
00:55:31,760 --> 00:55:33,560
With birch saplings.

424
00:55:34,760 --> 00:55:36,160
Which means?

425
00:55:36,760 --> 00:55:38,760
Same thing:
10 times as much.

426
00:55:38,880 --> 00:55:41,080
I have everything:
bills, contracts...

427
00:55:41,560 --> 00:55:43,360
That's the way it is.

428
00:55:44,760 --> 00:55:46,800
For the time being.

429
00:55:47,800 --> 00:55:49,800
It's a deal.

430
00:55:51,680 --> 00:55:53,200
You're a son of a bitch.

431
00:55:53,280 --> 00:55:55,120
No, I just need the money.

432
00:55:55,200 --> 00:55:57,200
Excuse me.
Should I light the stove?

433
00:55:57,800 --> 00:55:59,600
Yeah, I am cold.

434
00:56:02,800 --> 00:56:03,840
Karol...

435
00:56:05,840 --> 00:56:07,640
can you do Jadwiga's hair today?

436
00:56:08,640 --> 00:56:10,040
Today?

437
00:56:10,640 --> 00:56:12,640
Why not? I have some time.

438
00:56:40,720 --> 00:56:42,400
should I cut the engine, boss?

439
00:56:43,720 --> 00:56:45,520
No, keep the car warm.

440
00:56:57,960 --> 00:56:58,960
Hello.

441
00:56:59,960 --> 00:57:01,760
You bought the whole store!

442
00:57:02,160 --> 00:57:03,160
Presents.

443
00:57:03,960 --> 00:57:05,160
Come in.

444
00:57:05,760 --> 00:57:07,480
I'll just be a second.

445
00:57:08,760 --> 00:57:10,480
I'm starting a company.

446
00:57:11,080 --> 00:57:12,480
Big time.

447
00:57:12,960 --> 00:57:15,480
30% of the capital
comes from the money you gave me.

448
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,280
Like it or not,
you're my partner.

449
00:57:21,080 --> 00:57:22,280
I'd like you

450
00:57:22,480 --> 00:57:24,520
to run it with me.

451
00:57:25,200 --> 00:57:26,520
Serious?

452
00:57:27,800 --> 00:57:29,520
Serious.

453
00:57:31,840 --> 00:57:33,520
Volvo?

454
00:57:33,840 --> 00:57:35,120
Volvo.

455
00:57:35,840 --> 00:57:37,320
Burgundy?

456
00:57:37,840 --> 00:57:39,520
Burgundy. Company car.

457
00:57:43,960 --> 00:57:45,840
Can I think it over?

458
00:57:48,880 --> 00:57:50,560
Merry Christmas.

459
00:58:22,440 --> 00:58:25,160
Ideal place for the secretary.

460
00:58:29,360 --> 00:58:30,960
Here is a second office.

461
00:58:31,360 --> 00:58:32,960
Spacious, isn't it?

462
00:58:34,160 --> 00:58:37,160
The view is rather attractive.

463
00:58:40,360 --> 00:58:42,400
Computer and sattelite hook-ups.

464
00:58:42,480 --> 00:58:43,680
We need two faxes.

465
00:58:44,080 --> 00:58:46,000
Where do we plug them in?

466
00:58:47,080 --> 00:58:49,680
You have three telephone lines.

467
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:51,120
Oh, the telephone.

468
00:58:51,160 --> 00:58:52,120
Yes.

469
00:58:52,200 --> 00:58:55,720
Okay, I think we'll take
everything.

470
00:58:57,120 --> 00:58:58,200
Wonderful.

471
00:58:58,400 --> 00:59:00,240
Step into my office.

472
00:59:00,440 --> 00:59:02,040
Just one minute.

473
00:59:07,120 --> 00:59:09,040
Do you have a handkerchief?

474
00:59:31,080 --> 00:59:32,600
Nice.

475
00:59:35,200 --> 00:59:37,200
Warsaw at our feet.

476
00:59:37,400 --> 00:59:38,200
What's that?

477
00:59:38,400 --> 00:59:40,200
From the Complaint Department.

478
00:59:40,320 --> 00:59:42,200
-Bananas?
-Yes.

479
00:59:42,320 --> 00:59:45,120
Cold storage!
Wait for the price to go up.

480
00:59:47,320 --> 00:59:49,240
There's a fax coming in.

481
00:59:54,440 --> 00:59:56,960
Electronic equipment.
Thailand to Russia.

482
00:59:57,240 --> 00:59:58,640
Sell it here.

483
00:59:58,760 --> 01:00:01,160
My experts say
it's good stuff.

484
01:00:01,560 --> 01:00:04,560
It looks like good work.

485
01:00:07,360 --> 01:00:09,160
How thick should that wall be?

486
01:00:09,160 --> 01:00:10,280
50 cm.

487
01:00:10,400 --> 01:00:12,280
Measure it.

488
01:00:14,480 --> 01:00:15,480
46.

489
01:00:16,280 --> 01:00:18,200
Have those 4 centimeters added.

490
01:00:18,720 --> 01:00:20,720
But we'd have to knock it down.

491
01:00:21,520 --> 01:00:23,800
I guess so...
Goodbye.

492
01:00:40,760 --> 01:00:43,160
Dominique!

493
01:01:17,240 --> 01:01:18,240
Hello.

494
01:01:19,120 --> 01:01:20,160
Dominique?

495
01:01:21,360 --> 01:01:24,240
It's Karol.
I'm calling from Warsaw.

496
01:01:25,840 --> 01:01:27,240
From Poland.

497
01:01:32,480 --> 01:01:35,760
I'm sorry.
I wanted to hear your voice.

498
01:01:39,080 --> 01:01:40,880
Say something.

499
01:01:43,680 --> 01:01:46,280
Anything.

500
01:02:20,680 --> 01:02:23,480
"I hereby annul
my previous will and testament.

501
01:02:23,600 --> 01:02:25,280
"I resolve that..."

502
01:02:25,680 --> 01:02:27,600
That in the case of my death...

503
01:02:33,720 --> 01:02:35,520
...all my personal belongings

504
01:02:37,520 --> 01:02:39,520
and property

505
01:02:41,720 --> 01:02:43,640
as well as any sums...

506
01:02:44,040 --> 01:02:45,520
of money...

507
01:02:45,840 --> 01:02:47,840
of money in my bank accounts

508
01:02:49,560 --> 01:02:53,360
will be left
to my ex-wife, Dominique.

509
01:02:59,560 --> 01:03:01,560
Dominique has a "q-u-e"
at the end.

510
01:03:02,560 --> 01:03:04,560
I know how to spell Dominique.

511
01:03:27,120 --> 01:03:29,920
What are you doing out here?

512
01:03:30,640 --> 01:03:32,960
I'm afraid
the office may be bugged.

513
01:03:34,840 --> 01:03:35,960
By whom?

514
01:03:36,160 --> 01:03:38,960
Who knows?
I wanted to tell you something.

515
01:03:40,160 --> 01:03:41,160
Go ahead.

516
01:03:43,880 --> 01:03:47,160
Don't be surprised to see
my obituaries in the paper.

517
01:03:48,880 --> 01:03:50,880
One will be signed by you.

518
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:54,200
Okay.

519
01:03:55,880 --> 01:03:58,920
My lawer has my will.
You're the executor.

520
01:04:01,400 --> 01:04:03,000
Here are the names.

521
01:04:05,800 --> 01:04:08,640
You want me to drag her
from Paris?

522
01:04:09,040 --> 01:04:10,120
Will she come?

523
01:04:10,240 --> 01:04:12,040
She'll come.

524
01:04:12,720 --> 01:04:15,120
It's a lot of money.

525
01:04:17,040 --> 01:04:19,440
You don't want to know why?

526
01:04:19,760 --> 01:04:20,760
No.

527
01:04:22,840 --> 01:04:25,160
You'll need a passport again.

528
01:04:53,120 --> 01:04:55,440
Now you can have
the death certificate.

529
01:04:55,480 --> 01:04:57,240
My condolences.

530
01:05:09,960 --> 01:05:12,760
Here.
Everything is in order.

531
01:05:19,480 --> 01:05:21,680
You know what's next?

532
01:05:21,880 --> 01:05:22,880
What?

533
01:05:26,920 --> 01:05:29,920
We need someone to bury.

534
01:05:30,120 --> 01:05:32,120
A corpse?

535
01:05:32,160 --> 01:05:34,720
You don't plan on...?

536
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:36,000
No.

537
01:05:37,320 --> 01:05:41,440
We'll buy one. These days
you can buy anything.

538
01:05:41,920 --> 01:05:43,720
You think so?

539
01:05:43,960 --> 01:05:46,760
Would you mind
a Russian import, boss?

540
01:06:04,800 --> 01:06:07,400
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

541
01:06:08,600 --> 01:06:09,800
Let's go.

542
01:06:23,120 --> 01:06:25,840
It couldn't be better, boss.

543
01:06:27,120 --> 01:06:29,840
He's impossible to identify.

544
01:06:30,040 --> 01:06:31,040
What happened?

545
01:06:31,360 --> 01:06:33,240
His head got crushed.

546
01:06:33,360 --> 01:06:34,840
He leaned too far.

547
01:06:35,040 --> 01:06:36,840
out a train window.

548
01:06:38,080 --> 01:06:39,880
Let's close it.

549
01:06:49,600 --> 01:06:50,880
I'll manage.

550
01:06:51,080 --> 01:06:53,080
Okay. Goodnight boss.

551
01:06:55,200 --> 01:06:56,400
I'll close up.

552
01:07:33,280 --> 01:07:34,600
You scared me.

553
01:07:34,680 --> 01:07:36,400
Why?
You knew I was coming.

554
01:07:36,600 --> 01:07:38,200
I don't know...

555
01:07:38,400 --> 01:07:40,200
Afraid of what will happen?

556
01:07:44,320 --> 01:07:46,200
Here's your passport.

557
01:07:46,280 --> 01:07:48,240
Your ticket to Hong Kong.

558
01:07:48,840 --> 01:07:52,240
Your address.
I rented you a nice house.

559
01:07:54,040 --> 01:07:55,640
Are you sure?

560
01:08:01,360 --> 01:08:03,760
Don't be late for the plane.

561
01:08:03,840 --> 01:08:06,280
At 10 o'clock
I'll call the police.

562
01:08:07,280 --> 01:08:10,280
They'll be there
half an hour later.

563
01:08:10,480 --> 01:08:12,760
At 10:30 you'll be in the air.

564
01:08:14,280 --> 01:08:16,880
-Easy isn't it?
-Easy.

565
01:08:21,280 --> 01:08:22,280
Mikolaj...

566
01:08:22,720 --> 01:08:23,800
So long.

567
01:10:54,640 --> 01:10:56,840
I wanted you to come.

568
01:10:58,640 --> 01:11:00,840
I wanted to be sure.

569
01:11:01,680 --> 01:11:03,880
I didn't want to have
to ask anymore.

570
01:11:04,680 --> 01:11:06,680
Karol...

571
01:11:10,680 --> 01:11:12,680
You cried at my funeral.

572
01:11:13,880 --> 01:11:15,200
Why?

573
01:11:16,680 --> 01:11:19,200
Because you were dead.

574
01:11:23,920 --> 01:11:26,720
Can I touch your hand?

575
01:11:37,840 --> 01:11:39,760
Sit down.

576
01:11:46,160 --> 01:11:48,760
Can I lay my hand here?

577
01:12:00,080 --> 01:12:03,800
I've wanted to lay my head
here for such a long time.

578
01:13:27,320 --> 01:13:29,800
You moaned louder than
on the phone.

579
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:31,320
Yes.

580
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:38,520
You won't look at me?

581
01:15:18,960 --> 01:15:20,240
Karol?

582
01:15:52,520 --> 01:15:55,320
Mikolaj, please.
It's Dominique.

583
01:15:57,520 --> 01:15:59,840
It's Dominique.
Where's Karol?

584
01:16:00,560 --> 01:16:01,840
He is not dead. I saw him...

585
01:16:01,960 --> 01:16:04,040
You were at his funeral.

586
01:16:04,320 --> 01:16:07,160
I was not at his funeral.
He's alive.

587
01:16:07,320 --> 01:16:08,320
I'm sorry...

588
01:16:09,320 --> 01:16:12,880
You have to help me find him.
I love him.

589
01:16:13,560 --> 01:16:16,560
Of course. It's row 23.
Tomb 10675.

590
01:16:18,320 --> 01:16:20,880
The name of the cemetery
is Powazkowski.

591
01:16:23,320 --> 01:16:24,600
He's back!

592
01:16:24,800 --> 01:16:26,000
I think I doubt that.

593
01:16:26,040 --> 01:16:27,720
I have to hang up.

594
01:16:31,600 --> 01:16:33,120
Dominique Vidal?

595
01:16:33,200 --> 01:16:34,200
Yes?

596
01:16:35,320 --> 01:16:36,320
Police.

597
01:16:37,840 --> 01:16:39,320
Passport, please.

598
01:16:39,320 --> 01:16:40,920
It's at the front desk.

599
01:16:42,640 --> 01:16:44,320
Call downstairs.

600
01:16:56,680 --> 01:16:58,320
We have a search warrant.

601
01:16:58,680 --> 01:17:00,320
Can I get dressed?

602
01:17:01,320 --> 01:17:03,320
I'm a French citizen.

603
01:17:06,680 --> 01:17:09,320
Someone from the consulate
is coming.

604
01:17:10,320 --> 01:17:13,520
You have the right to remain
silent until he comes.

605
01:17:14,520 --> 01:17:16,520
I have nothing to hide.

606
01:17:16,800 --> 01:17:19,000
What do you want from me?

607
01:17:23,520 --> 01:17:26,040
Have you begun executing the will?

608
01:17:26,520 --> 01:17:28,560
Yes, so?

609
01:17:31,040 --> 01:17:33,560
Your ex-husband was wealthy.

610
01:17:34,040 --> 01:17:35,040
Yes.

611
01:17:38,880 --> 01:17:41,560
That's all, thank you.

612
01:17:51,320 --> 01:17:54,320
We don't believe your husband
died a natural death.

613
01:17:55,720 --> 01:17:57,520
What?

614
01:17:59,600 --> 01:18:02,120
He was helped.

615
01:18:07,320 --> 01:18:10,120
We have proof you were here
the day he died.

616
01:18:13,840 --> 01:18:16,240
The stamp is in your passport.
How's that?

617
01:18:16,320 --> 01:18:18,640
He's not dead. He's alive.

618
01:18:19,960 --> 01:18:22,680
-Who?
-My husband.

619
01:18:29,680 --> 01:18:32,200
Who was buried yesterday
at 11:30?

620
01:18:34,800 --> 01:18:36,680
Him.

621
01:18:37,880 --> 01:18:40,720
So who's alive?

622
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:46,200
No one.

623
01:18:48,040 --> 01:18:50,720
Hello. I'm Monsieur Le Gac
from the consulate.

624
01:20:23,640 --> 01:20:24,960
What's new?

625
01:20:26,160 --> 01:20:28,320
Don't stand in the window.

626
01:20:28,560 --> 01:20:30,960
Someone will see you.

627
01:20:32,960 --> 01:20:34,320
It's ready.

628
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:45,200
What?

629
01:20:46,200 --> 01:20:49,000
I remember identifying you
after the exhumation.

630
01:20:51,080 --> 01:20:53,320
Boy, did we identify you!

631
01:20:53,520 --> 01:20:55,000
Mikolaj puked.

632
01:20:56,320 --> 01:20:59,000
Good thing you didn't
turn yourself in. We'd be in jail.

633
01:21:00,120 --> 01:21:03,040
You, me, Mikolaj, the driver
and some others.

634
01:21:08,240 --> 01:21:11,040
I made you some cherry jam.
Do you want it?

635
01:21:13,240 --> 01:21:16,040
Someday I'll cook the snails
in the garden.

636
01:21:18,080 --> 01:21:20,080
I'll make a stew.

637
01:21:20,280 --> 01:21:21,320
the lawer?

638
01:21:22,080 --> 01:21:24,080
He came by. He's expensive.

639
01:21:25,280 --> 01:21:27,080
He said...

640
01:21:31,280 --> 01:21:32,320
What?

641
01:21:35,320 --> 01:21:38,320
That he sees a little light
at the end of the tunnel.
