1
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:06,403
You should've seen me last night at O'Malley's
I sat there with the band !

2
00:00:09,409 --> 00:00:12,379
Okay, I didn't do anything
But I sat there !

3
00:00:12,446 --> 00:00:14,414
Geez, Berg, I'm sorry I missed it but...

4
00:00:14,448 --> 00:00:19,286
You know what ? It hit me the other day...
I'm actually here to get a degree !

5
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:22,022
Hey! Come watch softball with me today

6
00:00:22,055 --> 00:00:23,590
Hey!  I gotta go to class !

7
00:00:25,158 --> 00:00:28,028
Berg, we can't all be philosophy majors

8
00:00:29,096 --> 00:00:32,032
Look, it's not my fault a bunch of guys in sandals did my homework for me

9
00:00:32,033 --> 00:00:33,233
four thousand years ago

10
00:00:36,303 --> 00:00:36,650
That's mine

11
00:00:36,703 --> 00:00:37,604
Ehhh...

12
00:00:39,506 --> 00:00:41,975
So, what do you plan to do after grad school?

13
00:00:42,776 --> 00:00:44,278
Why can't you just let me be happy?

14
00:00:44,538 --> 00:00:47,782
Because it's not fair to the rest of us!

15
00:00:47,782 --> 00:00:51,018
I mean, you triple majored in undergrad and you never even opened up a book!

16
00:00:52,039 --> 00:00:53,854
That's...the wonder of me!

17
00:00:55,222 --> 00:00:58,025
No, that's not the wonder of you!
That's the trouble with you!

18
00:00:58,258 --> 00:01:02,563
See, you're always skating by...and someday -- SOMEDAY -- you're gonna hit a rough spot

19
00:01:02,629 --> 00:01:05,899
Who poured you a double mocha of grumpy this morning?

20
00:01:07,534 --> 00:01:09,203
Grumpy

21
00:01:10,370 --> 00:01:14,341
I spent all night on this, I've got a test in structures,
we have to be at work at three, and..

22
00:01:14,708 --> 00:01:19,746
Oh, boy...

23
00:01:16,009 --> 00:01:17,978
I'm breaking up with Melissa today

24
00:01:20,981 --> 00:01:22,249
we have to be at work at three?

25
00:01:25,986 --> 00:01:28,021
I'm breaking up with Melissa today?!

26
00:01:28,422 --> 00:01:31,091
One hole! C'mon!
Berg, I can't be late

27
00:01:31,291 --> 00:01:33,627
When Sharon stops down we'll make her give us a ride

28
00:01:34,127 --> 00:01:35,395
What makes you think she's gonna stop down?

29
00:01:36,029 --> 00:01:38,165
I stole her last roll of toilet paper

30
00:01:38,198 --> 00:01:39,600
Berg, I'm not in the mood...

31
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:41,768
So what the hell's going on with you and Melissa, huh?

32
00:01:43,103 --> 00:01:47,608
I don't know
-- look, next week is our six-month anniversary and the lease is up on Hong Kong.

33
00:01:47,441 --> 00:01:50,143
- Huh?
- China's taking back the lease on Hong Kong

34
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:53,580
Really?
I never knew the Chinese were leasing

35
00:01:53,947 --> 00:02:02,389
I mean, think about all those people, who worked so hard to make Hong Kong what it is, right?
For what?They have no future! It's just like Melissa and me

36
00:02:02,923 --> 00:02:09,663
I mean, if I was meant to spend my life with her, I'd be thinking about getting married by now!
Now, do you see me shopping for a ring? Nooooooo

37
00:02:09,730 --> 00:02:13,167
...thusly, we are living in Hong Kong, waiting for our lease to run out.

38
00:02:13,734 --> 00:02:18,872
Quit thinking so much! You like her, she adores you...screw the future

39
00:02:19,406 --> 00:02:21,074
One under!

40
00:02:21,975 --> 00:02:26,013
Look, look...Melissa's terrific. But she's just...she not 'The One'

41
00:02:24,078 --> 00:02:38,425
I don't -- So Melissa's not 'The One', huh?

42
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:32,753
8:45. All is clear

43
00:02:34,488 --> 00:02:36,190
Since when do you have asthma?

44
00:02:39,826 --> 00:02:43,430
Berg, you've gotta stop doing these experiments, you're gonna hurt yourself!

45
00:02:44,331 --> 00:02:46,333
It pays 50 bucks!

46
00:02:47,668 --> 00:02:49,069
But you don't have asthma!

47
00:02:49,403 --> 00:02:54,408
Don't need it! You know they always say not to exceed the recommended daily dosage?

48
00:02:54,474 --> 00:02:54,942
Yeah?

49
00:02:55,108 --> 00:02:59,847
Well, I'm the guy...who exceeds it so they know why you shouldn't!

50
00:03:01,014 --> 00:03:06,119
Well, I'm the guy that had to drive you to the hospital when that new foot spray made your toenails fall off!

51
00:03:06,987 --> 00:03:08,021
They grew back thicker!

52
00:03:09,923 --> 00:03:10,924
Berg, you just can't!

53
00:03:11,091 --> 00:03:13,193
You hate being single!
No, don't change the subject!

54
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:16,396
Dating, getting used to someone, finding out their quirks..

55
00:03:17,831 --> 00:03:18,732
What's Melissa's?

56
00:03:18,764 --> 00:03:19,433
What?

57
00:03:19,867 --> 00:03:20,167
Quirk

58
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:23,570
Nothing

59
00:03:28,709 --> 00:03:30,711
Peter, we don't play that

60
00:03:32,479 --> 00:03:33,647
All right, but you can't tell anyone

61
00:03:33,881 --> 00:03:36,617
Soon as you tell me, I'm chopping off my tongue

62
00:03:37,484 --> 00:03:38,385
- Melissa...
- Yeah.

63
00:03:38,519 --> 00:03:40,787
When we're...you know, going at it?
Yeah?

64
00:03:40,988 --> 00:03:45,425
She starts to laugh, but like...uncontrollably

65
00:03:46,293 --> 00:03:47,561
Sharon!.....

66
00:03:47,561 --> 00:03:48,529
You guys suck!

67
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,368
So sex makes Melissa happy

68
00:03:54,768 --> 00:04:00,774
No, no, no, no, no...no...we are way past happy
This is psychotic. It's maniacal. It's like...

69
00:04:09,316 --> 00:04:10,851
THAT'S what that is?!

70
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:15,656
Did you put the seat back up?
Why do we suck?

71
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:20,561
Because,we all graduated together, yet I have to put on heels, which I hate;

72
00:04:21,361 --> 00:04:27,734
and go out into the real world and sell chemicals, which I hate;
while you two knuckleheads get to play golf...which I also hate

73
00:04:28,702 --> 00:04:30,771
Yeah, but you make like a bazillion dollars!

74
00:04:31,071 --> 00:04:38,946
Selling my soul! Look, if I close this deal today I make commission on 500 gallons of toxic cleaner I'm selling to some oil rig

75
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:46,086
So...I can enjoy a weekend at the Cape, while killing all sea life between here and Guam
--ugh, I hate myself!

76
00:04:46,353 --> 00:04:47,688
But you love your Beamer!

77
00:04:50,157 --> 00:04:52,893
Hey, why don't you drop me off when you take Pete to class?

78
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:54,495
What, I'm taking Pete to class??

79
00:04:54,628 --> 00:04:56,497
That's perfect! Let's us be off, huh?

80
00:04:57,464 --> 00:04:59,766
- Pete's breaking up with Melissa today.
- Good!

81
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,935
- Good? You said liked her?!
- Lied!

82
00:05:15,048 --> 00:05:18,452
- So?
- So? How'd she take it?

83
00:05:19,253 --> 00:05:20,387
I'd say pretty well.

84
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:20,821
You didn't do it

85
00:05:21,221 --> 00:05:25,025
No.....but I made a lunch date to do it here

86
00:05:26,126 --> 00:05:26,894
What are you doing?

87
00:05:27,528 --> 00:05:36,003
Oh,oh...I've got everything planned out. The blue cards, why it's best for her; the yellows, why we should stay friends; and the pinks...

88
00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:38,138
..things to say when she starts to cry.

89
00:05:40,707 --> 00:05:43,544
You know, this behavior reflects badly on both of us

90
00:05:45,679 --> 00:05:49,483
Hey, Bill, you know I'm thinking it might be time to spring for some new cushions!

91
00:05:49,616 --> 00:05:53,987
- Hmmm...good idea, and maybe some curtains, and a little paint job too
- There ya go!

92
00:05:54,087 --> 00:05:55,355
Yeah, maybe we should think up a new name,

93
00:05:55,622 --> 00:06:04,031
because I tell you what it won't be Beacon Street Pizza no more!
It won't be the same place my daddy built! Here build your own damn place!

94
00:06:05,799 --> 00:06:07,167
Good going Pete!

95
00:06:07,534 --> 00:06:07,935
I didn't even--

96
00:06:07,968 --> 00:06:10,003
Ahhh! What's with him?

97
00:06:10,170 --> 00:06:11,205
He breaking up with Melissa

98
00:06:11,972 --> 00:06:12,973
What does he want to do that for?

99
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:15,175
He feels she's not 'The One'

100
00:06:15,809 --> 00:06:17,311
Tell him to shut up

101
00:06:18,912 --> 00:06:22,216
Hey Pete! I found you that article on Marlon Brando's trainer!

102
00:06:28,655 --> 00:06:33,160
Thanks, Mr. Bauer.Why is he always bringing me things?

103
00:06:33,961 --> 00:06:34,228
He loves you

104
00:06:35,062 --> 00:06:39,166
He's delusional! He constantly telling me stories about his life that I know are from movies!

105
00:06:39,466 --> 00:06:41,001
You don't *know* that

106
00:06:41,502 --> 00:06:45,072
Berg, there was no way he was one of the Apple Dumpling Gang

107
00:06:47,508 --> 00:06:47,909
Incoming...

108
00:06:48,075 --> 00:06:51,411
Aw, Melissa...she wore her hair down

109
00:06:52,045 --> 00:06:55,582
I just want you to know I support you a hundred percent. Bill, it's starting!

110
00:06:56,116 --> 00:07:02,923
Hey! Hey sweetie! Hey Bill! Hi Mr. Bauer! Berg

111
00:07:04,658 --> 00:07:06,793
My class made you cookies.

112
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:10,097
Aww.....

113
00:07:11,498 --> 00:07:12,299
They shouldn't have

114
00:07:12,366 --> 00:07:15,536
They love you. 'Cause they know I love you

115
00:07:17,938 --> 00:07:20,707
Melissa, you know how the lease is running out on Hong Kong?

116
00:07:20,407 --> 00:07:20,874
Sure...

117
00:07:22,276 --> 00:07:22,509
Well --

118
00:07:22,543 --> 00:07:29,583
Although there is that stipulation that China has to ensure the preservation of Hong Kong's way of life both socially and economically for at least another 50 years.

119
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:44,231
- Yeah. Of course
- God, you're smart

120
00:07:38,592 --> 00:07:40,360
So...Hong Kong's still gonna be Hong Kong?

121
00:07:45,232 --> 00:07:48,268
-What are these?
...Ooh! Sorry! Are you okay?

122
00:07:48,168 --> 00:07:49,536
Yeah, I was trying to hand them to you!

123
00:07:51,839 --> 00:07:54,208
Spilling the water? Bill, what do you make of that?

124
00:07:54,308 --> 00:07:55,742
Take him out, he's done

125
00:07:57,377 --> 00:08:02,983
Bill, I don't believe we've seen the last of this *feisty* young girl from Wisconsin!

126
00:08:04,785 --> 00:08:06,620
Don't talk into the food

127
00:08:07,254 --> 00:08:07,988
Very smooth

128
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:10,190
Look, I can't do this with you guys leering!

129
00:08:11,325 --> 00:08:13,263
I always leer. She'd be suspicious if I weren't leering

130
00:08:14,296 --> 00:08:20,100
-- she'd be like, 'Why isn't Berg leering?" Berg Leering...isn't that a type of Merlot?

131
00:08:22,369 --> 00:08:27,274
Maybe it's a Cabernet... 3:10 -- starting to babble

132
00:08:29,843 --> 00:08:33,180
Uh, Pete -- you'd better get back in there before Bauer steals your woman

133
00:08:35,616 --> 00:08:38,719
I thought I told you no more experiments. They interfere with your work

134
00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:40,021
This is harmless !

135
00:08:40,521 --> 00:08:42,990
Yeah, that's what you said when you couldn't get your sweat glands to stop

136
00:08:45,626 --> 00:08:47,060
I had to follow you around with a mop!

137
00:08:48,996 --> 00:08:55,569
The shark's coming right at me. And...I only have one bullet left. I think, 'Ohh, I'm a goner

138
00:08:57,237 --> 00:09:00,707
Then I see the oxygen tank in its mouth -- what do you think I do?

139
00:09:00,774 --> 00:09:01,975
You shot the tank and the shark blew up!

140
00:09:02,242 --> 00:09:03,277
I shot the tank!

141
00:09:05,646 --> 00:09:06,380
And the shark blew up!

142
00:09:08,148 --> 00:09:10,017
You're a brave man, Mr. Bauer

143
00:09:10,317 --> 00:09:13,153
And then, you and Richard Dreyfuss swam back to shore. Thanks a lot, Mr. Bauer

144
00:09:14,955 --> 00:09:16,323
Oh, that was a hell of a day!

145
00:09:19,059 --> 00:09:20,561
You are a lucky guy

146
00:09:22,462 --> 00:09:23,063
Yeah...

147
00:09:30,637 --> 00:09:33,640
What is with you today? Is there something you want to tell me?

148
00:09:33,674 --> 00:09:33,907
No...

149
00:09:35,475 --> 00:09:36,844
Are you trying to break up with me?

150
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:40,214
NO! Not at all! Why, are we having problems?

151
00:09:40,681 --> 00:09:41,648
No, you're just acting weird

152
00:09:42,416 --> 00:09:44,017
Hey Berg, what have you done to him?

153
00:09:44,084 --> 00:09:47,087
Hey, this one isn't me, 'cause I'm the one who said he shouldn't break up with you!

154
00:09:47,154 --> 00:09:47,821
NO!!..

155
00:09:50,557 --> 00:09:52,593
- I don't believe you!
- No, I wasn't! He's evil!

156
00:09:52,893 --> 00:09:58,432
He may be evil, but at least he's honest!You're so...uh! Move! You're just so...

157
00:09:58,632 --> 00:10:04,171
No, I don't want to hear it. The hell with you, life's short, Pete. See ya around

158
00:10:04,271 --> 00:10:04,805
Melissa --

159
00:10:05,072 --> 00:10:12,679
Ten years from now
-- when you're fat, and alone, and you have to wear a baseball cap at Club Med to hide your hair transplants; remember

160
00:10:13,547 --> 00:10:15,516
-- you had a good thing here and you blew it

161
00:10:20,787 --> 00:10:24,291
I don't believe it! She broke up with me! I just got dumped

162
00:10:24,625 --> 00:10:26,160
Boy, did you ever!

163
00:10:27,227 --> 00:10:29,363
And in front of everybody, too!

164
00:10:35,936 --> 00:10:37,070
So, did you get the account?

165
00:10:37,771 --> 00:10:42,075
Yep. One more client for me, one less species of bird

166
00:10:44,645 --> 00:10:47,114
Sharon, if you don't like it, quit

167
00:10:47,347 --> 00:10:49,750
Life's a waste unless you're doing what you love

168
00:10:50,684 --> 00:10:53,954
You're right. I mean, I can do anything I want! I'm smart!

169
00:10:54,021 --> 00:10:54,822
Absolutely right

170
00:10:55,189 --> 00:10:56,723
- I'm motivated!
- Yes, you are.

171
00:10:56,590 --> 00:10:57,424
I'm a people person!

172
00:10:57,524 --> 00:10:59,493
I gotta go back and count my pepperonis

173
00:11:00,661 --> 00:11:02,863
I am! Aren't I Berg?

174
00:11:03,797 --> 00:11:04,631
Sharon?...

175
00:11:05,632 --> 00:11:10,270
You're a lot of things, but people person? It's goes the Unabomber, then you.

176
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:13,106
- Hey...
- No!

177
00:11:14,274 --> 00:11:15,576
That's why we love you

178
00:11:25,052 --> 00:11:26,019
- how was the delivery?
- Fine

179
00:11:28,188 --> 00:11:29,356
- Traffic?
- Not bad

180
00:11:30,657 --> 00:11:31,859
The toppings slide?

181
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:33,794
Little bit

182
00:11:35,462 --> 00:11:38,932
Gees, you two fight like a couple of broads! Kick his ass, Pete!

183
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,468
I can't...he's wearing my shirt

184
00:11:43,937 --> 00:11:45,172
I can't believe you're mad at me

185
00:11:46,073 --> 00:11:50,644
-- isn't that what you wanted? I mean, one minute you're gonna to break up with her, the next minute she breaks up with you

186
00:11:51,378 --> 00:11:53,113
And you flip out

187
00:11:54,548 --> 00:11:55,315
He has a point

188
00:11:55,349 --> 00:11:57,384
Berg, you should've just minded your own damn business

189
00:11:57,418 --> 00:11:58,752
Ah, he's gotcha there!

190
00:12:00,287 --> 00:12:02,489
I mean, when she walked out of here, I had an epiphany

191
00:12:03,457 --> 00:12:07,761
I mean, how many Melissas are there in the world?? What's wrong with me??

192
00:12:08,562 --> 00:12:15,302
I'll tell you what's wrong with you, okay?
You keep saying Melissa's not 'The One", when in reality you know she is 'The One', and you're scared to death of it

193
00:12:15,836 --> 00:12:17,337
Ding, ding, ding! Berg wins!

194
00:12:20,107 --> 00:12:20,874
All right...cover for me...

195
00:12:21,141 --> 00:12:21,942
Where are you going?

196
00:12:22,009 --> 00:12:25,312
Over to Melissa's to blame the whole thing on you
-- if there's anything she'll believe, it's that.

197
00:12:25,412 --> 00:12:26,446
Uh, no she won't

198
00:12:26,747 --> 00:12:27,014
Why not?

199
00:12:27,881 --> 00:12:30,784
Right now, if I'm little miss "Yippie, I get summers off!"

200
00:12:33,754 --> 00:12:42,996
I'm thinking...'maybe I over-reacted'. Then you come through the door blaming it all on Berg,
which says to me that you did in fact want to break up and you need your buddy to do it for you.

201
00:12:43,597 --> 00:12:46,900
Thank you so much. Thank you so much for destroying my future

202
00:12:50,337 --> 00:12:51,138
Future-killer!

203
00:12:54,508 --> 00:12:55,809
You know, I was in love once...

204
00:12:57,744 --> 00:13:02,015
...we shared a flat in France. Then the war came
-- all hell broke loose

205
00:13:09,656 --> 00:13:13,327
when she walked back into my life......but by then she was married

206
00:13:14,061 --> 00:13:16,964
Don't do what I did, son...don't let her get on that plane!!

207
00:13:21,702 --> 00:13:22,970
It's okay, Mr. Bauer

208
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:24,805
you'll always have Paris

209
00:13:27,875 --> 00:13:29,476
Pete, delivery

210
00:13:30,177 --> 00:13:33,881
Let me take this one...I want to see if I can operate heavy machinery

211
00:13:34,882 --> 00:13:35,516
Fine

212
00:13:36,116 --> 00:13:39,286
I'll just assume the "Drive Safe" is implied

213
00:13:49,163 --> 00:13:50,631
Berg

214
00:13:51,498 --> 00:13:52,666
Thank you, I'd love to

215
00:13:55,235 --> 00:13:57,771
So, let me guess
he sent you to make up with me?

216
00:13:58,772 --> 00:14:00,040
He doesn't know I'm here...

217
00:14:00,874 --> 00:14:02,643
...ooh! Oranges!

218
00:14:03,076 --> 00:14:03,911
Why are you here?

219
00:14:04,611 --> 00:14:07,948
Look, Mel...I'm no expert on relationships --

220
00:14:08,182 --> 00:14:08,982
This just in

221
00:14:10,217 --> 00:14:14,087
But I am an expert on Pete. Okay? And sometimes, he just gets a little confused, is alll

222
00:14:14,521 --> 00:14:15,989
Give the guy a break -- I mean, I'm the one who blew it

223
00:14:19,026 --> 00:14:22,229
-That's right! I feel better when you guys are together
-Give me a break, Berg!

224
00:14:22,729 --> 00:14:24,832
I do! It makes my best friend happy

225
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:30,938
Look...you know like in tag -- where's that place where you're safe, where they can't get you?

226
00:14:32,005 --> 00:14:34,942
- Home base?
- Home base. Pete is my home base

227
00:14:35,609 --> 00:14:38,912
I mean, I wouldn't get to be me, if he wasn't him

228
00:14:43,450 --> 00:14:45,752
And someday, I hope I'll find someone like you

229
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:47,020
And when I blow it...

230
00:14:48,555 --> 00:14:49,623
which I will...

231
00:14:50,924 --> 00:14:54,461
I know he'll go over and make her realize that there's something here worth saving

232
00:14:55,462 --> 00:14:58,999
Wow...I've never known you to be so open

233
00:14:59,733 --> 00:15:00,234
Me neither...

234
00:15:03,303 --> 00:15:04,805
- oh, God...
- What?

235
00:15:07,808 --> 00:15:15,149
7:48 -- having used...800 times the recommended daily dosage

236
00:15:15,449 --> 00:15:20,154
Now experiencing a side effect, feeling extremely honest and uh, forthright

237
00:15:23,423 --> 00:15:25,425
I've never more afraid in my life

238
00:15:26,693 --> 00:15:28,529
Berg, this has sodium penathate in it

239
00:15:29,296 --> 00:15:33,066
- Truth serum
- So...you have to tell the truth?

240
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:35,169
Noo....yeah. Wooo!

241
00:15:35,769 --> 00:15:36,403
Ha!!!

242
00:15:37,037 --> 00:15:39,206
Last Wednesday, when Pete was supposed to take me to the gallery opening?

243
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:40,207
I've gotta go

244
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:43,911
And he called me and told me that you had an allergic reaction to shellfish and had to rushed to the hospital?

245
00:15:44,611 --> 00:15:45,913
We were at the dog track

246
00:15:46,513 --> 00:15:50,918
And last week, when he couldn't make it to my cousin's engagement party
because you guys were collecting toys for the orphanage?

247
00:15:51,118 --> 00:15:53,987
- We were playing Pop-n-Shot at O'Malley's
- I knew it!

248
00:15:54,755 --> 00:15:58,892
You have to understand -- it was for the World Championship of all ...time!

249
00:16:01,428 --> 00:16:02,095
Hm, hm, hm...

250
00:16:04,631 --> 00:16:05,499
What does he tell you about me ?

251
00:16:05,499 --> 00:16:07,701
- Everything
-Like what, everything?

252
00:16:08,635 --> 00:16:11,738
Like the first time he saw you, he said he actually felt his heart stop

253
00:16:12,973 --> 00:16:13,574
Really?

254
00:16:15,175 --> 00:16:19,813
And you...do a phenomenal Linda Rondstat imitation

255
00:16:21,081 --> 00:16:21,715
Aww...Pete!

256
00:16:25,018 --> 00:16:26,220
And he hates sushi...

257
00:16:27,654 --> 00:16:29,756
...but goes with you all the time because he knows you love it

258
00:16:30,390 --> 00:16:32,226
Why didn't he say anything?!

259
00:16:34,161 --> 00:16:36,663
And you laugh like a mad scientist during sex!

260
00:16:45,472 --> 00:16:47,007
I did a bad thing...

261
00:16:48,008 --> 00:16:50,077
Who, Berg...who did you do a bad thing to?

262
00:16:54,448 --> 00:16:55,516
Yes!...

263
00:16:55,616 --> 00:16:57,718
God, Berg, what more could you have done to me today?!

264
00:16:59,386 --> 00:17:02,122
Please, do not tell me you went over to Melissa's...

265
00:17:03,023 --> 00:17:03,991
Aw, Berg!

266
00:17:04,525 --> 00:17:08,295
I didn't want you blaming me for screwing up the rest of your life, so I went over there to get your guys back together!

267
00:17:08,562 --> 00:17:11,465
And?!
And she *never* wants to speak you again!

268
00:17:15,302 --> 00:17:17,604
- Berg, what did you tell her?
- Everything

269
00:17:18,438 --> 00:17:22,776
It wasn't me -- it was the asthma inhaler. It had side effects
it's like a truth serum

270
00:17:22,910 --> 00:17:24,311
Berg, what did you tell her?!

271
00:17:24,845 --> 00:17:28,382
I...I told where you really were last Saturday

272
00:17:28,448 --> 00:17:31,051
Oh, God...
I told her about the laughing...

273
00:17:31,351 --> 00:17:32,019
You WHAT?!

274
00:17:32,519 --> 00:17:33,687
You know, when you guys have sex?

275
00:17:35,222 --> 00:17:37,191
She laughs like a crazy lady in an attic

276
00:17:37,624 --> 00:17:39,526
God, so THAT'S what that is!

277
00:17:42,896 --> 00:17:46,633
- Do you still have to tell the truth?
- I'm not sure. Ask me if I like your hair this way

278
00:17:47,434 --> 00:17:51,872
- Do you like my hair this way?
- Yes. Very much.It wore off

279
00:17:53,473 --> 00:17:57,177
Berg, my life is not one of your experiments -- just leave it alone!

280
00:18:01,014 --> 00:18:06,420
- You know, I'm starting to feel *way* underappreciated here
- Go!

281
00:18:07,054 --> 00:18:07,621
Cover for me

282
00:18:08,355 --> 00:18:12,659
- Yeah, there's about as much chance of me wearing this thing as - -
- Ah-ah-ah, hey! People person!

283
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:17,998
- Excuse me -- can I see a menu?
- It's a pizza place!

284
00:18:19,533 --> 00:18:22,336
What are you doing out here? Did you come to push me into traffic?

285
00:18:24,605 --> 00:18:27,908
- I don't like you being mad at me
- I'm not mad at you, I'm mad at me

286
00:18:28,709 --> 00:18:33,714
Berg, I'm gonna be 25 and I don't even know where my life is
-- and the one good thing I had, I messed up!

287
00:18:34,748 --> 00:18:41,655
When my dad was my age, he had a house, he had a wife, he had me! I mean, what do I have?

288
00:18:42,489 --> 00:18:45,459
You have the ability to suck the life out of an evening!

289
00:18:49,363 --> 00:18:54,168
There's no...there's no blueprint for life! Okay, first it's miosis
-- out of the womb, snip

290
00:18:54,701 --> 00:19:01,341
Then you get a big ol' aneurysm and you slump over your desk
Okay, everything in between just happens, Pete....enjoy it

291
00:19:03,143 --> 00:19:07,648
Berg, I'm not like you, all right?
I don't find pearls when I eat oysters

292
00:19:07,981 --> 00:19:13,287
I can't learn Russian in three days from a book called 'How To Learn Russian In Three Days"

293
00:19:14,288 --> 00:19:15,556
I wish I could, but I can't

294
00:19:15,923 --> 00:19:17,124
That's why you have me

295
00:19:17,591 --> 00:19:21,528
- Are you gonna have my children?
- There *is* an experiment at MIT next week

296
00:19:31,805 --> 00:19:33,140
What if I wind up alone?

297
00:19:33,841 --> 00:19:41,949
What if I wind up alone, hanging out in some pizza place, telling anyone who will listen to me about the time I plowed under my cornfield and built a baseball diamond?

298
00:19:43,484 --> 00:19:45,085
Listen to me, okay?

299
00:19:45,719 --> 00:19:49,389
Everything's gonna work out, all right?...you'll have the wife and the kid
it's there

300
00:19:50,524 --> 00:19:52,226
You just can't see around that turn yet

301
00:19:52,693 --> 00:19:53,760
How can you be so sure?

302
00:19:54,528 --> 00:19:56,363
'Cause I know. It has to

303
00:19:57,130 --> 00:20:00,067
If my life doesn't work out I'm coming to live with you

304
00:20:02,102 --> 00:20:02,870
You heard me

305
00:20:04,371 --> 00:20:04,738
Fine!

306
00:20:14,214 --> 00:20:16,383
Berg, what do you think is gonna happen to Sharon?

307
00:20:16,717 --> 00:20:18,085
I'm sure she'll settle down, have kids...

308
00:20:19,286 --> 00:20:20,754
Get your butts back in here!

309
00:20:21,229 --> 00:20:22,856
Or take over Cuba

310
00:20:28,295 --> 00:20:29,496
I didn't even get a tip!

311
00:20:31,598 --> 00:20:34,535
You told a customer to shut up or you'd bash his head in with a shovel!

312
00:20:36,036 --> 00:20:38,138
Well, he kept *waving* at me!

313
00:20:40,374 --> 00:20:42,776
Oh, how long does it take to make up with somebody?

314
00:20:43,544 --> 00:20:44,511
Relax...

315
00:20:46,346 --> 00:20:47,181
Hey, hey!

316
00:20:48,582 --> 00:20:52,019
- So how'd it go?
- Eh, go figure -- Melissa and I are going to try and work things out

317
00:20:52,553 --> 00:20:54,388
Great! I've always liked her

318
00:20:58,659 --> 00:21:01,795
C'mon --I think what we need here is some Pop-n- Shot at O'Malley's

319
00:21:02,729 --> 00:21:04,031
- Oh, no, I can't
- Sharon's buying

320
00:21:04,498 --> 00:21:06,099
'Cause I'm a people person!

321
00:21:07,501 --> 00:21:10,637
I told Melissa I'd go back over with a video

322
00:21:11,438 --> 00:21:12,339
- Go back over?
- Mmm-hmmm

323
00:21:14,174 --> 00:21:16,343
Not in your condition
Look at him

324
00:21:16,677 --> 00:21:19,880
-Oooh... all clammy and yellow...
- No, guys..

325
00:21:19,917 --> 00:21:23,117
Food poisoning!  Hits you like that!

326
00:21:23,283 --> 00:21:25,118
-Guys...
- We'll call from the bar
