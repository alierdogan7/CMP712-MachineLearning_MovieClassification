So you want to fight?
I'll cool you off.

333
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:42,677
Get to the masthead and stay
there until I call you down.

334
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:45,908
BYAM: All the way, sir?
- All the way.

335
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:54,593
- Get below or go aloft!
- Yes, sir!

336
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:04,234
Rather heavy weather
to send him aloft, isn't it?

337
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:08,712
They must learn this isn't a beer garden.
If you don't teach them, I will!

338
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:12,750
Look alive, you crawling caterpillar!

339
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:25,595
- Where's Byam?
- I couldn't help it, Stewart.

340
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:28,320
When the man looks at me,
I want to jump overboard.

341
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:29,754
Where's Byam?

342
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:33,913
- The old man sent him aloft.
- You let him take the blame, huh?

343
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:36,512
Here, here!

344
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:39,953
You've started enough trouble!
Time you learn discipline!

345
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:41,155
Get into your hammock...

346
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:43,197
...before I put you over a gun!
- Yes, sir.

347
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:49,479
Get up!

348
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:51,471
You see, sir? It isn't my fault.

349
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:54,598
They're only jealous because
I've been at sea before.

350
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:56,959
Who did that?

351
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:58,758
I did, sir.

352
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:01,158
Come here.

353
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:07,919
Good.

354
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:36,999
[BELL RINGS]

355
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:43,879
How she creaks. Wind's a gale.

356
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:47,077
I'm too old to envy young Byam aloft.

357
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:50,471
- Splice the main-brace, Mr. Morgan.
- I'll take it to kill germs.

358
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:52,517
What? Waste my brandy?

359
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:57,629
Here, you use the ship's drinking water.
It would shrivel me wooden leg.

360
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:00,911
Did you ever hear how I lost my leg?

361
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:03,230
- No, no, but we will.
- Well...

362
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:06,949
- I'm worried about Byam.
- Oh, he'll weather it all right.

363
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:12,035
Well, I left my leg with
John Paul Jones back in '78.

364
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:14,031
We came astern with a Yankee.

365
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:18,352
Up went our colors and our captain hails,
"What ship is that?"

366
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:23,275
"American ship <i>Ranger</i>," roars Jones,
and up go his colors.

367
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:27,149
"Louder, you Yankee pip-squeak,"
our captain yells.

368
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:28,833
"I can't hear you!"

369
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:34,472
"Can you hear this?" says Jones,
and he lets go a broadside.

370
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:37,438
Thundering guns.

371
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:39,158
You all right?

372
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:43,231
- Nothing lost, Mr. Christian.
- Look after him, Mr. Morgan.

373
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:53,959
Keep her head up!

374
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:17,871
MAN:
Starboard!

375
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:55,479
Get him below, to the surgeon!

376
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:00,154
Mr. Christian!

377
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:06,550
- Who brought that man down?
- I did, sir!

378
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:08,039
But I sent him aloft!

379
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:10,430
He's gone under. The top's no place.

380
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:13,239
I know his place. Time you knew yours.

381
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:16,392
Maintain discipline, not break it!
Send him aloft again!

382
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:18,073
Mr. Bligh, he's had enough!

383
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:20,629
Send him aloft again!

384
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:26,752
That's right, lad. Drink another.
You'll be as right as a truism.

385
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:29,070
If you'd lost a leg, now...

386
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:32,357
I lost mine in action against
the French, off Jamaica.

387
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:34,590
A French surgeon did the trick for me.

388
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:38,389
He apologized in French,
and I cursed him in English.

389
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:41,917
- How is he?
- I'm all right, sir.

390
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:43,559
He'll go anywhere.

391
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:45,950
Get to the masthead again, Byam.

392
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:49,949
- I've taken my punishment, sir.
- Get to the masthead!

393
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:52,998
I've had a bellyful of that masthead
from Captain Bligh!

394
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:55,390
- You can't make me go back again!
- Byam.

395
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:58,279
It was Mr. Christian
brought you down, lad.

396
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:01,472
Thank you, sir.

397
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:04,951
I didn't understand. Captain's orders.

398
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:07,758
- You mind?
- No. Let him have it.

399
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:09,194
Here, you'll need this.

400
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:12,352
Here's something else you'll need.
You're a plucky youngster.

401
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:15,796
If necessary, I'd be happy
to cut off your leg anytime.

402
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:17,518
Thank you, sir.

403
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:27,112
- Lf anything happens to that lad, Bligh...
- Christian!

404
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:29,191
Christian, careful!

405
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:53,438
CHRISTIAN:
Ship's company, off hats.

406
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:56,953
O, eternal God, who alone
spreadest out the heavens...

407
00:29:57,120 --> 00:30:00,795
...and rulest the raging sea, who has
compassed the waters with bounds...

408
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:02,996
...until night and day come to an end...

409
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:06,272
...receive into thy almighty
and most gracious protection...

410
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:10,115
...the persons of us, thy servants
and the fleet in which we serve.

411
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:14,229
Preserve us from the dangers of the sea
that we may be a safeguard...

412
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:17,233
...unto our gracious lord
King George and his kingdoms...

413
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:21,793
...and a security for such as pass on
the seas upon their lawful occasions...

414
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:25,839
...and that we may return in safety
to enjoy the blessings of the land...

415
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:30,516
...with a remembrance of thy mercies
to praise and glorify thy holy name...

416
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:32,671
...through Jesus Christ our Lord, amen.

417
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:36,469
TOGETHER: Amen.
- Ship's company, on hats.

418
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:43,199
The ship's company
will bear in mind...

419
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:46,079
...we are at sea
under the articles of war.

420
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:49,550
Perhaps you are unaware
that the articles of war invest in me...

421
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:52,757
...the authority to order punishment.

422
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:59,390
During the recent heavy weather, I've
watched you at work on deck and aloft.

423
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:03,633
You don't know wood from canvas, and
it seems that you don't want to learn.

424
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:07,236
Well, I'll have to give you a lesson.
You, you, you, step forward.

425
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:09,994
You three are
a disgrace to saltwater!

426
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:12,310
Ten days on half rations.
What's your name?

427
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:16,029
- Thomas Burkitt, sir.
- He's a thief, sir. Dartmoor Prison.

428
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:18,111
- A thief.
- Convicted. Offered a choice:

429
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:20,157
Dartmoor Prison or the king's navy.

430
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:22,197
You've been to Dartmoor Prison, Burkitt?

431
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:24,476
- Yes, sir.
- It seems you prefer the navy.

432
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:28,269
You may regret that choice
before this voyage is over. Your name?

433
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:32,991
Thomas Ellison, sir. Pressed into service.
I've got a wife, a baby.

434
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:37,119
I asked your name, not the history
of your misfortunes. Your name?

435
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:41,033
- Smith.
- Not you, you idiot! You.

436
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:45,273
- William Muspratt, sir.
- Have you got a wife, Muspratt?

437
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:47,396
Have you got a wife?

438
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:50,077
Two, sir.

439
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:59,113
The ship's company will remember that
I am your captain, judge and your jury.

440
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:02,272
You do your duty
and we may get along...

441
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:06,115
...but whatever happens,
you'll do your duty. Go forward.

442
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:08,077
CHRISTIAN:
Lively, lads.

443
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:14,669
Thief. Nobody calls me a thief
but the men I steals from.

444
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:16,990
Half rations.

445
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:22,151
You there!

446
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:24,117
Who did that?

447
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:25,554
I can't tell you, sir.

448
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:27,039
- Mr. Morrison.
- Aye, sir.

449
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:29,794
- Report that man for two dozen lashes.
- But...

450
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:32,559
I done it, sir.

451
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:34,358
Pick it up.

452
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:37,592
Put it back.

453
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:42,513
- Mr. Morrison, lay on with a will.
- Aye, aye, sir.

454
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:49,319
Bligh, these men aren't
king-and-country volunteers.

455
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:51,596
They've been brought aboard
by press gangs.

456
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:54,399
In a week, I'll get some spirit
without flogging.

457
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:56,790
Teach them who's master
and never let them forget.

458
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:58,234
- Mr. Morrison!
MORRISON: Aye.

459
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:01,517
Before we see port, I'll make them
jump at a midshipman's jacket...

460
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:04,069
...even if it's hung
on a broomstick to dry.

461
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:08,279
Give this man his two dozen. When I ask
for information, I expect to get it.

462
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:18,314
- I didn't hear the watch call, sir.
- Why not?

463
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:20,789
Sorry, I was cleaning brass
for Mr. Byam.

464
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:22,234
That's true, sir.

465
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:25,073
Stretch this man over a gun
and give him two dozen lashes.

466
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:26,514
But I was responsible, sir.

467
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:29,035
Byam will be in charge
of the punishment.

468
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:32,510
Two dozen.
That's enough, Mr. Morrison.

469
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:42,996
MAN: Man overboard!
- Bring a line!

470
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:46,357
Idiot. I'll have to teach
my top men not to fall off the ship.

471
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:47,794
Mr. Morrison!

472
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:51,396
When you get him onboard,
stretch him with a rail to dry him off.

473
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:02,435
I can't stand it. I got to get water.

474
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:05,435
Get back to your work.

475
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:08,876
I wanted water for my knees, sir.
I can't stand it. Please, sir.

476
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:12,476
- What is it?
- This man left his work. Wants water.

477
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:15,473
Look, sir, it's the sand
worked in cruel.

478
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:18,632
- I wanted water to wash it.
- I'll give you water.

479
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:22,190
Mr. Morrison, keelhaul this man.

480
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:27,674
MAN:
Haul away!

481
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:46,355
- Well?
- The man is dead, Mr. Bligh.

482
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:12,159
Mr. Bligh, I've seen calms and doldrums,
but not one like this in 40 years.

483
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:15,630
- The men in the boats are worn-out.
- Not the way they're pulling.

484
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:18,439
- Put new men into the boats.
- Mr. Morrison, pipe the men.

485
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:20,716
Change the boat crews.

486
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:25,274
Dive in with your mess, lads.
The boats are alongside.

487
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:28,193
Mr. Byam, look at this bit
of meat, sir. It's alive.

488
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:31,996
I'm sorry, lad.
There's nothing I can do about it.

489
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:35,838
This bit of meat was
mined in a rock quarry.

490
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:40,232
- Here, I'll change with you, lad.
- Thanks.

491
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:45,951
It's alive, all right...

492
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:48,472
...but they're fresh meat anyway.

493
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:51,393
Mr. Byam, I'm reporting
these two men unfit for duty.

494
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:54,518
- Very good. You men are relieved.
