360
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:34,200
The Green Lanterns
have a legend:

361
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:36,700
No one can see
the beginning of time.

362
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:38,400
It's a universal law.

363
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:39,600
Write him a ticket.

364
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:47,900
No!

365
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:48,900
[WHIMPERING]

366
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:55,700
Uploading
the program.

367
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:57,200
Make it fast.

368
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:59,800
Having a little trouble
with the brakes.

369
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:19,100
That all
really happened?

370
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:20,200
Think so.

371
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:22,300
Then we won.

372
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:24,100
Everything's back to normal?

373
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:27,400
That's a nasty cut, John.

374
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:32,300
You don't remember going on
a mission with us today, do you?

375
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:34,100
I just got here.

376
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:36,400
The time line's
restored to equilibrium.

377
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:39,300
We're the only two people
who remember what happened.

378
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:48,800
That complicates
things.

379
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:50,400
What happened
to Chronos?

380
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:51,700
I reprogrammed the belt

381
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:55,100
to make sure that Chronos
would never come to exist.

382
00:21:57,100 --> 00:21:59,300
ENID: You worthless, good for nothing,

383
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:00,700
wretched waste of space.

384
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:02,400
[SCREAMING]
You invent a time machine

385
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,800
and can't think of
anything useful to do with it?

386
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:06,100
I can think of one thing.

387
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:10,700
Worthless, good-for-nothing,
wretched waste of space.

388
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:12,400
You invent a time machine

389
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:15,000
and can't think of
anything useful to do with it?!

390
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,400
I can think of one thing.

391
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:20,100
ENID: Worthless, good-for-nothing,
wretched waste of space...
